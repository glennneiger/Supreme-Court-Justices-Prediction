mr.
howard
j.
trienens
may
it
please
the
court.
i'm
howard
trienens,
i
represent
the
southern
railroads.
when
we
started
out
this
case,
we
were
equal
partners
with
the
northern
railroads
and
we
were
dividing
uniform
and
equal
basis
of
rates.
as
governor
sanders
has
pointed
out,
this
case
has
changed
that
relationship.
we
are
now
not
--
unequal.
this
case
was
tried
on
the
expressive
mission
of
the
northern
railroads.
they
were
seeking
a
disproportionate
division
of
a
uniformed
structure
of
rates.
they
wanted
a
disproportionate
share.
and
they
got
it,
for
performing
exactly
the
same
service
on
the
same
car
moving
between
the
territories.
they
have
given
a
17%
inflation,
17%
more
for
performing
the
same
service
on
the
same
car.
i'll
show
where
that
came
from
and
why
that's
not
supported
by
any
evidence.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
per
mile,
yes
sir.
300
miles
on
the
south,
same
car,
300
in
the
north
they
get
17%
more
compensation
for
doing
that
same
work
on
that
same
car
under
this
order.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
50-50.
we
split
it
equally
when
there
were
--
we
each
perform
half
the
service
with
an
equal
haul.
we
split
it
50-50,
and
we
were
splitting
it
equally
and
we
were
splitting
a
uniformed
system
of
rates
which
were
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
northern
railroads.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
this
train.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
we
would
question
it
unless
they
carry
through,
and
did
two
more
things.
first
found
that
these
differences
in
cost,
just
because
a
fellow
spends
more
money
shouldn't
get
a
medal
for
that.
but
these
differences
in
cost
were
inherent,
inherent
in
the
difficulty
of
the
territory.
they
couldn't
cure
it
by
consolidations.
they
couldn't
cure
it
by
becoming
more
modern.
they
couldn't
cure
it,
it
was
inherent.
now
if
it
wasn't
inherent
difference
like
that
amount
in
the
goldberg
that'd
be
something
else.
and
also
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
necessary.
that's
right,
a
necessary
difference
in
the
cost.
not
just
they
happen
to
spend
the
more
money
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
well,
efficiency
in
this
case
is
a
somewhat
slippery
word.
now,
i
think
they
found
they
were
equally
efficient.
but
that
meant
they
found
that
they
were
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
they
were
operating
the
systems
as
they
then
existed
with
equal
efficiency.
they
didn't
say,
because
obviously
they
merged
pan
and
central,
and
they
merged
a
new
haven
to
create
efficiencies
that
these
separate
railroad
managements
could
not
achieve
by
themselves.
there's
quite
a
difference
in
there.
well
now,
this
situation
of
unequality
puts
the
south
in
a
uniquely
different
position.
throughout
the
country,
east
of
the
rockies,
the
rates
are
uniform.
the
east
and
the
west,
midwest,
the
east
and
the
southwest,
the
divisions
relate
to
the
rates
and
they're
uniform.
even
out
in
mount
pacific
territory
where
there
is
an
inflation,
it's
related
directly
to
the
higher
level
of
rates
and
the
commission
related
them
on
a
basis
of
consistency
as
was
pointed
out
in
this
court's
opinion
in
the
transcontinental
case.
this
is
the
only
case,
the
first
case
where
inter-territorial
rates
have
been
divided
so
that
one
railroad
gets
a
disproportionate
division
of
uniform
rates.
this
is
the
only
case.
now
how'd
it
get
that
way?
here's
how
it
happened.
they
used
rail
form
a
as
to
which
there
is
no
quarrel.
rail
form
a
is
a
formula
that
chops
these
railroads
costs
into
various
elements.
we
have
no
quarrel
with
how
it
divides
the
cost
as
between
elements
vital,
terminal
or
otherwise.
what
we
did
was
we
analyzed
this
rail
form
a
cost,
and
we
said
“how
come
these
form
a
averages
are
17%
higher?
how
does
it
happen?”
well,
we
looked
at
that
sort
of
thing
we
would
all
think
of
as
railroad
cost
first.
the
sort
of
thing
mr.
cerra
indeed
talked
about.
running
a
train,
paying
the
crew,
buying
the
locomotive,
fuel,
maintaining
the
roadway,
stations,
all
the
sort
of
things
you
first
think
of
in
railroad
costs.
are
they
higher
in
the
north
on
an
average
basis?
no,
it
doesn't
cost
anymore
to
run
a
train
in
the
north.
and
that's
true
whether
you
use
these
form
a
averages
or
you
don't.
the
rail
form
a
and
these
averages
have
nothing
to
do
with
this
inflation
when
it's
the
items
that
you
think
of
is
running
trains,
maintaining
the
roadway
and
that
sort.
so,
where
did
this
inflation
come
from?
here's
where
it
came
from.
it
came
from
a
handful
of
items.
commuter
deficits,
border
point
interchanges,
car
cost,
empty
return
ratios
and
just
a
handful
of
items
that
we
discussed
in
our
briefs.
now,
it's
not
surprising
and
shouldn't
be
surprising
that
the
cost
for
some
items
are
higher
in
the
north.
after
all,
the
north
is
a
very
different
place.
it's
a
highly
industrialized
territory.
of
course
they
got
a
lot
of
commuter
service
in
the
south
as
of
now.
it
hasn't
anything
to
do
with
north-south
freight
traffic.
and
indeed
the
commission
found
as
a
finding
of
fact
that
many
items,
many
items
of
suburban
service
are
solely
related
to
suburban
service.
meaning
the
finding
that
these
cost
haven't
anything
to
do
with
north-south
freight
traffic.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
surely.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
in
so
far
as
fixing
relationships
between
north
and
south.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
the
commission
has
in
the
past,
and
i
can't
say
--
i
can't
look
behind
what
they
think
of
it,
has
in
the
past
said
that
it
did
consider
deficits
from
passenger
service.
it
has
also
said
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
it
has
also
said
that
they've
treated
commuter
deficits
as
a
separate
problem
which
should
not
be
dealt
with
by
the
freight
shipper
subsidizing
the
service,
but
rather
should
be
dealt
with
by
the
local
community.
excuse
me.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
the
answer
is
yes.
it's
the
passenger
deficits,
but
no
as
to
commuter
service.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
as
a
matter
of
commission
policy.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
yes
sir.
and
that
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
that's
right.
and
i
want
to
draw
another
line
here
though.
because
in
these
rate
cases,
the
reason
they
consider
passenger
deficit
at
all
was
to
meet
the
revenue
needs
of
these
carriers.
they
needed
more
money
so
they
raised
the
rates
to
give
them
these
--
give
them
these
money
including
--
and
they
took
into
consideration
passenger
deficits.
in
this
case,
they
have
expressly
disclaimed
revenue
needs
as
a
basis
for
decision.
they
say
that
their
order
is
based
on
the
cost
of
north-south
freight
traffic,
freight
traffic.
and
they
have
found
that
the
commuter
deficits
are
based
at
least
many
items
of
the
cost
are
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
not
quite
sir.
not
quite.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
they
picked
as
their
standard
of
this
whole
case
the
cost
of
north-south
freight
traffic.
they
further
found
that
many
items
of
commuter
cost
solely
and
then
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
--
or
then
as
to
this
case,
they
nevertheless
went
in
and
put
the
whole
passenger
deficit
into
this
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
i
can't
answer
that
your
honor.
and
the
reason
i
can't
is
that
in
the
early
50's,
they
did
say
they
would
reflect
the
passenger
deficits
in
a
rate
increase.
in
1959,
they
went
to
congress
and
have
been
finished
this
passenger
deficit
investigation,
they
said
that
as
to
commuter,
commuter
deficit
should
not
be
subsidized
by
freight
shippers.
and
they
have
acted
consistent
with
that
since
that
time.
there
were
no
freight
rate
increases
from
about
'59
to
'67.
and
in
the
latest
decision,
i
just
can't
answer
your
question.
i
just
don't
know.
i
do
know
in
their
last
decision,
they
said
this.
and
this
bears
upon
the
argument
that
we
got
to
use
form
a
cost
and
these
averages
because
it's
essential
to
our
rate
cases.
in
that
case,
they
had
among
other
freight
commodities
not
merely
citrus
fruit,
but
all
perishables
from
north-south,
territory
wide,
and
somebody
put
in
rail
form
a
unadjusted
cost
with
respect
to
these
rates
that
they
were
increased.
and
the
commission
said
“territorial
average
cost
are
entitled
to
little
weight
in
determining
the
cost
of
handling
particular
movements.
and
by
that
they
mean
a
territorial
wide
movement
of
this
very
traffic.
so
the
idea
of
anything
you
do
here
about
rail
form
a
is
going
to
embarrass
them
and
all
in
their
administration
rate
cases.
that's
how
by
their
own
state
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
in
that
case,
they
were
showing
both.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
no
sir.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
it
includes
--
what
i
regard
as
a
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
the
full
cost
of
performing
this
north-south
service.
it
would
include
a
return
on
the
value
of
the
property.
for
example,
return
of
the
value
of
the
car
used
to
all
this
traffic.
that's
right
sir,
all
of
full
cost
of
handling
this
north-south
carrier.
that's
what
i
understood
the
commission
to
mean,
and
i
don't
quarrel
with
that
feature
of
it.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
yes
sir,
17%
less
than
the
north
for
doing
the
same
service.
now
let's
see
how
it
got
this
way.
i've
already
said
that
it
wasn't
operating
the
trains
and
it
wasn't
the
roadway.
it
was
a
handful
of
items.
and
i
think
i
can
illustrate
how
this
inflation
came
to
be
by
giving
an
example
as
to
one
of
these
items.
i
will
take
again
a
car
coming
from
the
south
that
moves
across
over
(inaudible)
potomac
area,
right
across
14th
st.bridge.
that's
an
interchange
point.
that's
where
the
southern
railway
comes
in
into
pan
central
and
the
b&o
goes
north.
and
there
is
a
service
performed
there.
it's
the
cost
of
interchanging
these
cars.
these
same
cars
come
in,
same
car
go
out
and
there
is
a
cost
involved
in
interchanging
them.
now
when
you
look
at
the
commission's
order
in
this
case
and
see
how
they
construct
it,
there's
a
separate
factor
which
they
call
cost
of
interchanging
gateways.
this
is
a
separate
factor.
it's
isolated
and
we
can
think
about
just
how
this
works.
the
railroad
operate
this
joint
yard
and
the
record
makes
it
perfectly
clear
uncontroverted
that
the
cost
for
each
railroad
coming
in
that
yard
and
going
out
of
that
yard
is
exactly
the
same.
exactly
the
same
and
you'd
know
that'd
be
the
same.
they're
in
the
same
yard
dealing
with
the
same
cars
through
the
same
joint
facility.
the
record
is
uncontroverted
that
the
costs
are
exactly
the
same.
the
record
also
shows
the
same
thing
at
these
other
interchange
points,
cincinnati,
evansville,
louisville.
we're
all
in
the
same
yards
interchanging
the
same
cars.
alright,
now
how
did
they
get
the
inflation?
well,
they
said,
“here
is
an
element
of
cost
of
interchange.
we
will
use
the
territorial
average.
the
territorial
average
per
car
interchange
throughout
the
south
is
used
and
the
territorial
average
throughout
the
north
is
used.”
and
it
happens
that
those
averages
are
58%
higher
than
the
north.
now
i
don't
question
that
on
the
average
for
all
the
traffic,
the
average
cost
is
58%
higher
than
the
north.
after
all,
as
was
pointed
out
earlier,
94%
of
the
northern
total
traffic
is
something
else.
it's
not
this
traffic,
it's
something
else.
it's
interchanging
with
western
lines
in
the
expense
of
chicago
district,
its
lots
of
other
things.
it's
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
they
do
enter,
your
honor.
and
as
to
those
items,
stations,
land
there
was
no
difference
in
the
averages
or
--
there's
no
quarrel
about
it.
there's
just
wasn't
--
that
doesn't
where
this
inflation
came
from.
it
came
from
just
a
handful
of
items
like
this
border
interchange
which
was
58%
higher,
these
car
costs
for
the
same
car
which
are
32%
higher
and
throwing
in
the
commuter
deficits.
it's
that
kind
of
thing
that
counted
for
this
whole
inflation.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
you
take
the
average
car
cost,
meaning
all
the
cars
of
all
different
kinds
throughout
the
south
and
all
the
cars
of
all
different
kinds
throughout
north,
and
the
average
cost
is
32%
higher
per
mile
than
the
north.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
well
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
some
of
it
is
due
to
more
specialized
equipment.
the
north
after
all
is
the
manufacturing
center.
they
have
more
specialized
equipment.
some
of
it
is
due
to
the
fact
that
the
north
uses
more
coal,
and
it
rents
coal
cars
and
coal
rentals
enter
into
all
this.
but
when
we're
talking
about
a
boxcar
handling
north-south
traffic
and
it's
the
same
car
moving
from
the
south
through
an
interchange
into
the
north.
the
same
car,
there's
no
rational
explanation
or
even
an
effort
to
explain
why
for
that
car,
it
could
be
32%
higher
than
the
north.
that's
the
whole
question
here.
we're
talking
about
north-south
freight
traffic.
and
the
question
is,
whether
there
is
any
evidence
to
support
these
higher
costs
for
the
items
where
the
whole
inflation
comes
from
and
show
they
in
fact
happen
on
this
north-south
freight
traffic.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
well
i
would
deny
it
because
i
can't
conceive
of
it
being
so.
the
northern
lines
didn't
really
try
to
show
it
was
so
as
to
these
cars.
they
just
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
if
they
did
and
if
it
was
inherent,
and
i'm
not
making
to
do
to
avoid
it.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
natural,
and
the
result
of
efficient
operations
as
to
these
cars.
and
the
northern
--
and
this
was
something
peculiar
of
the
north-south
freight
traffic,
then
they
would,
under
the
commission's
standard
here,
they
would
be
entitled
to
it.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
it's
due
part
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
partly
to
the
findings
which
go
to
the
--
where
they
don't
go
to
the
questions
of
how
the
cost
could
be
higher
on
these
cars
in
north-south
traffic,
partly
the
findings
which
don't
respond
to
that
and
in
large
part
to
the
evidence.
there
is
no
substantial
evidence
that
the
cost
of
these
items,
these
items
that
account
for
the
whole
inflation.
there's
no
substantial
evidence
or
any
evidence
that
these
costs
are
in
fact
higher
in
the
north
on
these
cars.
so
it's
both
findings
which
don't
really
address
themselves
to
this
question
and
the
lack
--
complete
lack
of
evidence.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
yes
sir.
and
i
would
--
i
think
it's
important
here
at
this
stage
to
say
exactly
what
this
court
found
in
three
or
four
sentences
here,
and
also
say
what
they
didn't
found,
because
just
what
this
court
below
found
is
critical
here.
the
court
analyzed
the
facts
as
follows.
they
pointed
out
that
only
a
few,
relatively
few
elements
of
the
cost
are
higher.
and
it's
uncontroverted
that
many
items
of
cost
are
no
higher
on
northern
railroads
and
southern
railroads.
the
inflation
is
attributable
to
relatively
few
cost
items,
and
they
list
--
the
court
lists,
commuter,
interchanging
cars,
cost
of
freight
cars
and
a
few
others.
as
to
these
controverted
items,
the
court
below
said,
and
they're
all
denying
this,
“the
commission
relied
exclusively
on
territorial
average
cost.”
now,
here's
the
holding
of
the
court.
judge
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
it
means
that
as
to
such
things
as
the
interchange
work
out
here
at
potomac
yard,
they
used
territorial
average
cost
of
all
traffic
in
the
north
and
all
traffic
in
the
south,
bulk
of
which
had
nothing
to
do
with
this
north-south
freight
traffic.
and
the
average
was
58%
higher.
so
they
divided
these
rates
just
as
though
it
cost
us
58%
more
to
do
the
same
work
in
the
same
yard
in
the
same
car.
they
used
these
averages.
and
it's
like,
in
that
point
your
honor,
it's
like
the
--
like
this
court
said
in
the
mechling
barge
case,
this
was
a
barge
rail
relationship.
the
court
said,
“the
un-sifted
averages
put
forward
by
the
commission
do
not
measure
the
allegedly
greater
cost
of
the
carriers
nor
indeed
show
they
exist.”
these
territorial
average
don't
show
that
the
cost
are
58%
higher
in
doing
this
workout
in
potomac
yard
nor
indeed
show
that
there's
any
difference
at
all.
and
the
record
shows
that's
causing
the
same
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
yes
i
do.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
no
sir.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
no.
if
you
--
if
your
question
was
on
this
traffic
they
have
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
alright.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
or
different
cars
on
a
different
something
else.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
that's
right.
not
only
shouldn't
be
used
as
a
matter
of
principle,
but
shouldn't
be
used
under
the
very
standard
selected
by
the
commission
itself,
which
was
the
cost
of
north-south
freight
traffic.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
and
it
isn't
that
i
say
that
somewhere
else
they
spend
more
on
these
cars.
it's
different
cars,
i
mean,
94%
of
their
traffic
is
different,
commodity
is
different,
traffic
or
specialized
cars.
they're
just
different
things
apparent
light
with
light.
well,
i
was
about
to
give
the
basis
of
the
decision
below,
and
i'd
like
to
read
slowly
if
i
may,
just
exactly
what
the
court
below
held.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
it's
on
349
of
the
appendix,
volume
1
of
the
appendix.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
the
commission
stated
its
exclusive
standard
to
be
the
relative
cost
of
handling
the
specific
freight
traffic
to
which
the
divisions
apply.
we
are
persuaded
that
the
order
is
not
based
on
substantial
evidence
nor
supported
by
recent
findings
within
the
meaning
of
sections
8
(b)
and
10
(e)
of
the
administrative
procedure
act,
because
the
use
of
territorial
averages
accounting
for
the
northern
inflation
has
not
been
supported
with
findings
or
evidence
relating
any
such
inflation
to
the
north-south
freight
traffic.
that
is
the
holding
below.
now,
let
me
also
quote
from
the
court
to
make
it
plain
what
the
holding
below
is
not,
because
this
morning,
it
was
suggested
that
the
court
had
substituted
its
view
of
the
case,
that
the
court
below
had
rewaived
the
evidence,
that's
not
so.
here's
what
the
court
said,
“with
the
commission's
expertise
in
mind,
it
is
our
duty
to
review
the
record
and
the
conclusions
reached
as
required
by
the
provisions
of
the
administrative
procedure
act.
as
to
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
to
support
the
order,
it
is
not
the
proper
function
of
this
court
to
substitute
its
judgment
or
to
weigh
evidence.
on
the
other
hand,
it
is
our
duty
to
ascertain
whether
or
not
the
findings
and
conclusion
are
supported
by
substantial
evidence.”
couldn't
find
a
clearer
statement
of
what
the
court's
function
is,
and
what
the
court's
function
is
not.
and
i
want
to
emphasize
again,
it
was
not
the
district
court
that
substituted
any
view
of
its
own
that
the
test
here
ought
to
be
north-south
freight
traffic
cost,
that
was
the
commission's
own
announced
standard.
this
court
took
that
standard
as
it
had
to,
and
determine
whether
there
was
substantial
evidence
to
support
this
inflation
with
respect
to
those
several
cost
items
that
accounted
for
the
entire
inflation.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
1956
cost.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
it
took
the
southern
line
six
months
between
the
time
the
north
completed
their
case
to
we
completed
our
case.
the
rest
of
this
time
was
taken
in
the
northern
lines
deciding
to
use
‘56
cost
in
1959
in
another
procedure
in
which
we
played
no
part.
i
don't
--
i
know
it's
a
great
problem
for
this
court
to
have
one
of
these
old
stale
cases
come
up
here.
i
don't
think
we
should
be
penalized
and
we
should
have
to
forego
uniform
division,
because
other
people
and
other
agencies
took
an
inordinate
amount
of
time.
we
were
not
accountable
for
any
delay
before
the
commission.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
oh,
1959
was
when
the
north
got
around
to
starting
this
really,
to
1965.
six
years,
something
like
that.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
yes
sir.
then
we'd
be
back
trying
it
out
now
if
the
commission,
i
presume,
would
not
decide
to
appeal
this.
but
to
that,
we
have
no
control
over
that.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
that's
right.
now,
i
think
i
will
emphasize
that
the
district
court
not
only
use
the
standard
that
the
commission
itself
had
selected,
north-south
freight
cost.
but
the
district
court
did
its
duty
under
the
administrative
procedure
act.
this
is
in
a
matter
where
that
court
had
any
choice.
administrative
procedure
act
directs
the
reviewing
court
shall
set
aside
commission
action,
found
to
be
unsupported
by
substantial
evidence.
that's
the
part
of
a
district
court's
job
to
the
reviewing
court
to
look
into
these
records
and
see
whether
there
is
substantial
evidence.
that's
all
this
district
court
did
and
found
none
to
support
these
inflations
and
the
items
that
they
actually
occurred.
i
also
realized
that
this
court
is
very
busy
with
many
constitutional
issues
and
it
can't
take
upon
itself
the
job
of
reviewing
these
administrative
records.
but
i
do
submit
that
the
district
court
is
the
initial
responsibility
and
it
was
fulfilled
in
this
case
in
a
well
reasoned
opinion,
and
using
precisely
the
standards
that
the
statute
required.
now,
there
was
statement
this
morning
that
this
court
had
somehow
immunized
from
judicial
review,
cost
findings
and
anything
as
complicated
as
the
railroad
divisions
case
and
citing
the
so
called
transcontinental
case
of
two
terms
ago.
now
that
just
didn't
so.
at
the
time
that
case
was
tried,
there
were
common
issues.
the
east
was
involved
in
that
case
when
the
transcontinental
case
was
first
brought,
and
there
were
common
issues.
some
of
these
car
costs
and
other
issues
were
involved.
commuter
never
was.
by
the
time
it
got
to
this
court,
the
eastern
roads,
the
northern
roads
it
settled
up.
and
this
court
observed
that
many
of
these
issues
just
didn't
have
to
be
reached
and
weren't
reached.
and
when
this
court
itself
reviewed,
because
the
district
court
hadn't
even
reached
the
question,
when
this
court
itself
reviewed
the
cost
determinations
of
the
commission,
it
didn't
say,
“you're
immune
from
judicial
review.”
it
looked
as
to
whether
there
was
substantial
evidence.
and
on
the
only
item
where
there
--
which
is
common
to
the
two
cases
that
there
was
evidence,
there
was
a
study
of
the
specific
traffic
in
that
case.
there
is
no
study
in
this
case
and
the
north
refused
to
make
a
study.
now
there
is
a
feature
of
the
transcontinental
case.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
well,
your
honor,
the
way
i
look
at
it
this
way.
the
--
it
would
be
very
easy
for
the
commission
to
get
through
with
this
case
correctly.
the
northern
lines
wanted
an
inflation
in
their
divisions.
commission
says,
“all
right,
the
test
is
cost
of
north-south
freight
traffic.”
on
this
record,
and
in
any
record
we've
seen
yet,
there
is
no
evidence
that
as
to
these
items
that
make
up
the
inflation
has
any
evidence
that
cost
more
on
the
north
on
this
traffic.
now
what
the
commission
ought
to
do
is
say
“dismissed,
you
haven't
proved
your
inflation.”
that's
easy,
dismissed.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
i
didn't
find
--
i
think
should
be
made
right
now
until
the
northern
lines
or
anybody
presents
some
evidence
that
the
costs
are
in
fact
higher
on
this
traffic.
the
findings
ought
to
be
they
haven't
proved
their
case
and
ought
to
be
dismissed.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
the
lower
court
recognized,
your
honor
that
in
saying
that
there
wasn't
substantial
evidence.
it
didn't
mean
that
the
commission
was
the
captive
of
the
northern
railroad's
failure
to
present
evidence.
that
the
commission
had
the
right
and
the
power
to
go
out
and
make
any
kind
of
comprehensive
cost
that
it
wanted.
now,
if
it
did
that,
that
would
take
time.
but
the
commission
has
no
duty
to
do
that.
the
commission's
duty
is
to
decide
the
case
on
the
record,
and
if
there's
no
evidence
to
support
an
inflation,
their
duty
is
not
to
give
it.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
district
court
said
that
the
--
that
the
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
well
i
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
no,
i
don't
think
it
did
either.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
i
don't
agree
with
that
in
this
situation
for
this
reason.
this
isn't
the
case
like
southern
case
was
15
years
ago,
like
the
transcontinental
case
was
a
couple
of
years
ago,
where
the
divisions
were
a
big
scattered
mess
that
everybody
agreed
were
wrong.
this
is
a
case
where
they
had
found
a
uniform
scale
of
divisions
to
fit
the
uniform
rates
that
are
now
in
existence.
if
this
case
is
sent
back
to
the
commission,
the
present
order
set
aside,
you
don't
go
back
to
some
chaos
that
everybody
recognize
it
has
to
be
changed.
you
go
back
to
the
uniform
equal
partner
divisions
of
rates.
now,
if
they
want
to
persist,
if
the
northern
lines
wish
to
persist
in
obtaining
an
inflation,
let
them
start
by
presenting
some
evidence
that
the
cost
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
i
mean
your
honor
that
has
contrasted
with
the
way
it
was
before
this
order
where
we
were
equal
partners.
and
we
each
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
if
they
want
more
than
equal
share,
they
ought
to
prove
it.
that's
right
your
honor.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
up
until
this
order.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
well,
specifically
the
way
it's
worked
is
that
there
are
two
scales,
a
northern
scale
and
a
southern
scale.
under
this
order
of
the
northern
scale
is
17%
higher
at
300
miles.
you
run
these
scales
through
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
$0.56
and
$0.44.
56-44
instead
of
being
equal
partners.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
that's
the
way
it
works.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
it
didn't
so
indicate.
they
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
no,
i
don't
believe
so
your
honor.
ability
to
move
the
traffic,
ability
to
meet
truck
and
barge
competition,
revenue
needs
of
the
railroads.
the
cost
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
well,
they
have
a
very
low
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
well
they
used
to
15
years
ago,
yes
sir.
but
you
can
read
these
last
few
rate
cases,
and
i'm
just
not
able
to
recite
as
to
what
they
based
it
on
it,
except
the
revenue
needs
of
the
railroads
not
cost
as
--
not
--
certainly
not
cost
of
specific
6%
of
the
traffic.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
well,
some
part
of
it
yes.
but
of
course
the
northern
revenue
needs
are
dominated
by
the
94%
of
their
freight
traffic
that's
not
this
segment.
so
it's
a
larger
more
commingle
we'd
miss.
now,
i'd
like
to
turn
to
the
last
illustration.
and
i
think
all
these
are
merely
illustrations
of
the
use
of
these
averages
to
inject
something
into
the
cost
that
really
have
nothing
to
do
with
cost
of
north-south
freight
traffic.
and
this
is
this
passenger
deficit
problem.
now
it's
--
in
the
transcontinental
case,
this
court
noted
in
an
argument
in
which
the
western
worlds
were
urging
that
their
passenger
deficits
be
reflected.
this
commission
--
this
court
said
“while
the
commission
has
sometimes
acted
to
offset
passenger
deficits
and
freight
rate
cases,
the
issues
are
quite
different.
when
in
a
division's
case,
it
is
argued
that
carriers
in
one
part
of
the
country
should
subsidize
the
passenger
operations
of
carriers
elsewhere.”
the
court
didn't
get
into
that
matter
in
the
prior
case
because
the
east
was
out
of
it,
and
they
held
that
they
--
it
should
really
dropped
out
of
the
case.
now
here,
the
commission
has
included
the
total
passenger
deficits,
and
i
think
we're
all
entitled
to
ask
how
come
and
why.
should
any
passenger
deficits
be
included
when
we're
talking
about
north-south
freight
cost?
well
the
southern
lines
theory
and
this
was
brought
out
earlier.
the
southern
lines
theory
is
that
there
are
common
costs.
taken
again
as
a
bridge
across
the
14th
st.--
right
next
to
the
14th
st.
bridge
is
a
railroad
bridge,
and
it's
got
be
painted.
it's
got
to
be
repaired
and
it's
used
by
passenger
trains
and
it's
used
by
freight
trains.
and
if
we
just
cut
out
all
the
passenger
trains,
we're
still
going
to
have
to
paint
it
and
we're
still
going
to
repair
it.
it's
a
common
cost
and
it's
proper
if
the
passenger
revenues
can't
pay
for
the
pay.
it's
proper
to
charge
that
common
cost
against
the
freight.
now,
i
don't
quarrel
with
the
commission
on
that
concept.
commission
adopted
that
concept.
they
said
that
common
cost
should
be
reflected.
i
don't
quarrel
that.
the
northern
lines,
and
indeed
commission
counsel
have
some
quarrels
with
that
in
their
brief.
they
have
quite
a
number
of
theories
of
how
this
passenger
deficit
ought
to
be
treated.
they
were
not
accepted
by
the
commission
and
many
of
them
are
inconsistent
with
what
the
commission
did.
what
the
commission
did
was
say
that
where
there
are
common
costs
that
must
be
incurred
to
provide
freight
service,
such
costs
are
properly
chargeable
to
freight
service,
so
far
so
good.
the
problem
here
is
that
these
commuter
lines
up
north
contain
many
items
of
cost,
many
items
of
cost.
tracks,
yards,
stations,
separate
facilities
that
can
be
considered
solely
related
to
suburban
service,
solely
and
exclusively
related
to
suburban
passenger
service.
those
aren't
my
words.
those
are
the
findings
of
the
commission
in
this
case.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
many
individual
items
of
suburban
service
can
be
considered
solely
related
as
suburban.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
when
this
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
that's
right.
that's
exactly
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
that's
exactly
what
we
argue.
exactly
what
we
argued
and
what
we
did
was
go
in
and
say
that
there
is
a
large
body
of
cost
that
aren't
common
and
shouldn't
be
allocated,
because
this
large
body
of
cost
are
solely
related
to
these
northern
commuters.
they
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
cost
of
north-south
freight
traffic.
we
got
our
evidence
on
that
from
a
presentation
of
the
northern
railroads.
mr.
justice
black
asked
the
question
“how
do
you
find
our
these
things?”
we
got
from
a
presentation
of
the
northern
railroads
to
congress
at
the
time
that
they
were
going
to
congress
as
they
still
are
and
saying
that
local
communities
ought
to
support
this
commuter
service.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
that
isn't
the
way
i
read
it.
they
say
because
the
commuter
deficit
includes
common
cost
which
should
be
incurred
to
provide
--
which
must
be
incurred
to
provide
freight
service.
such
costs
are
properly
chartered.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
that's
right.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
yes,
and
that's
the
point
--
exactly
the
point
on
which
the
district
court
said
“you've
given
no
reason
of
why
you
should
flip
in
the
solely
related
cost.”
yet
they
did.
now
the
other
side
of
this
question
is,
well
if
that
so,
why
don't
you
throw
out
any
solely
related
passenger
cost
in
the
south?
now
that's
exactly
what
we
suggested
to
the
commission
when
this
point
was
first
made
by
the
examiner.
we
said,
“if
you
think
there
are
solely
related
costs
in
the
south,
and
we
can
mention
those
for
you,
throw
them
both
out.
under
your
standard
of
the
cost
of
freight
traffic,
throw
them
both
out.”
and
we
would
still
--
the
south
would
still
be
better
off
from
the
way
you
did
it.
and
the
commission
never
even
mentioned
that
exception,
and
the
northern
lines
keep
saying
“well,
the
south
has
all
these.”
sure
we
do.
sure
it
ought
to
be
out.
if
south
and
north
and
ought
to
be
out
in
the
south.
and
the
commission
should
exclude
them
in
both
territories.
we
don't
question
that.
we've
urged
it.
we've
gotten
brushed
off
from
that
one.
now,
i've
given
two
illustrations.
i've
given
the
border
interchange
situation.
i've
given
the
commuter.
i've
briefly
addressed
myself
to
this
car
cost
feature.
all
these
items
are
essentially
the
same
situation.
it's
an
inclusion
in
north-south
freight
cost
of
things
that
have
not
been
shown
to
have
anything
to
do
with
this
inflation.
i
want
to
simply
summarize
by
saying
that
the
district
court
did
exactly
what
the
administrative
procedure
act
required
it
do.
reviewed
the
commission's
findings
and
it
reviewed
the
record
to
determine
whether
this
inflation
which
is
granted
the
north
was
supported
by
reason
finding
and
substantial
evidence.
without
invading
in
any
way
the
province
of
the
commission
to
set
the
policy
standards
upon
which
division
should
be
made.
the
court
below
found
as
it
had
to
find
on
this
record
that
the
inflation
was
not
supported
by
substantial
evidence
relating
the
higher
averages
to
this
source
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
yes
sir.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
yes
sir.
and
i
don't
regard
this
as
superseding
it
because
the
testimony
i
refer
to
says
that
the
great
bulk
of
the
passenger
deficit
is
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
i'm
saying
that
to
the
extent
that
you
have
to
qualify
this
by
the
existence
of
solely
related
deficits.
to
that
extent,
they
ought
to
go
out
in
both
territories.
i
noted
that
the
district
court
had
not
intruded
in
any
way
on
the
policy
decisions
of
the
commission.
it's
not
like
the
barge
railing
at
mole
case
last
year
where
a
district
court
had
decided
that
it,
the
district
court
would
decide
what
the
standard
ought
to
be.
here
the
commission
fixed
the
standard.
the
district
court
did
not
touch
it
at
all.
it
simply
found
whether
there
was
substantial
evidence
to
support
the
commission's
decision
under
that
standard.
now
we
believe
that
the
district
court
having
performed
its
duty
as
required
by
the
administrative
procedure
act
that
its
judgment
remanding
the
case
of
the
commission
should
be
affirmed.
thank
you
sir.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
may
it
please
the
court.
i'm
howard
trienens,
i
represent
the
southern
railroads.
when
we
started
out
this
case,
we
were
equal
partners
with
the
northern
railroads
and
we
were
dividing
uniform
and
equal
basis
of
rates.
as
governor
sanders
has
pointed
out,
this
case
has
changed
that
relationship.
we
are
now
not
--
unequal.
this
case
was
tried
on
the
expressive
mission
of
the
northern
railroads.
they
were
seeking
a
disproportionate
division
of
a
uniformed
structure
of
rates.
they
wanted
a
disproportionate
share.
and
they
got
it,
for
performing
exactly
the
same
service
on
the
same
car
moving
between
the
territories.
they
have
given
a
17%
inflation,
17%
more
for
performing
the
same
service
on
the
same
car.
i'll
show
where
that
came
from
and
why
that's
not
supported
by
any
evidence.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
per
mile,
yes
sir.
300
miles
on
the
south,
same
car,
300
in
the
north
they
get
17%
more
compensation
for
doing
that
same
work
on
that
same
car
under
this
order.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
50-50.
we
split
it
equally
when
there
were
--
we
each
perform
half
the
service
with
an
equal
haul.
we
split
it
50-50,
and
we
were
splitting
it
equally
and
we
were
splitting
a
uniformed
system
of
rates
which
were
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
northern
railroads.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
this
train.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
we
would
question
it
unless
they
carry
through,
and
did
two
more
things.
first
found
that
these
differences
in
cost,
just
because
a
fellow
spends
more
money
shouldn't
get
a
medal
for
that.
but
these
differences
in
cost
were
inherent,
inherent
in
the
difficulty
of
the
territory.
they
couldn't
cure
it
by
consolidations.
they
couldn't
cure
it
by
becoming
more
modern.
they
couldn't
cure
it,
it
was
inherent.
now
if
it
wasn't
inherent
difference
like
that
amount
in
the
goldberg
that'd
be
something
else.
and
also
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
necessary.
that's
right,
a
necessary
difference
in
the
cost.
not
just
they
happen
to
spend
the
more
money
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
well,
efficiency
in
this
case
is
a
somewhat
slippery
word.
now,
i
think
they
found
they
were
equally
efficient.
but
that
meant
they
found
that
they
were
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
they
were
operating
the
systems
as
they
then
existed
with
equal
efficiency.
they
didn't
say,
because
obviously
they
merged
pan
and
central,
and
they
merged
a
new
haven
to
create
efficiencies
that
these
separate
railroad
managements
could
not
achieve
by
themselves.
there's
quite
a
difference
in
there.
well
now,
this
situation
of
unequality
puts
the
south
in
a
uniquely
different
position.
throughout
the
country,
east
of
the
rockies,
the
rates
are
uniform.
the
east
and
the
west,
midwest,
the
east
and
the
southwest,
the
divisions
relate
to
the
rates
and
they're
uniform.
even
out
in
mount
pacific
territory
where
there
is
an
inflation,
it's
related
directly
to
the
higher
level
of
rates
and
the
commission
related
them
on
a
basis
of
consistency
as
was
pointed
out
in
this
court's
opinion
in
the
transcontinental
case.
this
is
the
only
case,
the
first
case
where
inter-territorial
rates
have
been
divided
so
that
one
railroad
gets
a
disproportionate
division
of
uniform
rates.
this
is
the
only
case.
now
how'd
it
get
that
way?
here's
how
it
happened.
they
used
rail
form
a
as
to
which
there
is
no
quarrel.
rail
form
a
is
a
formula
that
chops
these
railroads
costs
into
various
elements.
we
have
no
quarrel
with
how
it
divides
the
cost
as
between
elements
vital,
terminal
or
otherwise.
what
we
did
was
we
analyzed
this
rail
form
a
cost,
and
we
said
“how
come
these
form
a
averages
are
17%
higher?
how
does
it
happen?”
well,
we
looked
at
that
sort
of
thing
we
would
all
think
of
as
railroad
cost
first.
the
sort
of
thing
mr.
cerra
indeed
talked
about.
running
a
train,
paying
the
crew,
buying
the
locomotive,
fuel,
maintaining
the
roadway,
stations,
all
the
sort
of
things
you
first
think
of
in
railroad
costs.
are
they
higher
in
the
north
on
an
average
basis?
no,
it
doesn't
cost
anymore
to
run
a
train
in
the
north.
and
that's
true
whether
you
use
these
form
a
averages
or
you
don't.
the
rail
form
a
and
these
averages
have
nothing
to
do
with
this
inflation
when
it's
the
items
that
you
think
of
is
running
trains,
maintaining
the
roadway
and
that
sort.
so,
where
did
this
inflation
come
from?
here's
where
it
came
from.
it
came
from
a
handful
of
items.
commuter
deficits,
border
point
interchanges,
car
cost,
empty
return
ratios
and
just
a
handful
of
items
that
we
discussed
in
our
briefs.
now,
it's
not
surprising
and
shouldn't
be
surprising
that
the
cost
for
some
items
are
higher
in
the
north.
after
all,
the
north
is
a
very
different
place.
it's
a
highly
industrialized
territory.
of
course
they
got
a
lot
of
commuter
service
in
the
south
as
of
now.
it
hasn't
anything
to
do
with
north-south
freight
traffic.
and
indeed
the
commission
found
as
a
finding
of
fact
that
many
items,
many
items
of
suburban
service
are
solely
related
to
suburban
service.
meaning
the
finding
that
these
cost
haven't
anything
to
do
with
north-south
freight
traffic.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
surely.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
in
so
far
as
fixing
relationships
between
north
and
south.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
the
commission
has
in
the
past,
and
i
can't
say
--
i
can't
look
behind
what
they
think
of
it,
has
in
the
past
said
that
it
did
consider
deficits
from
passenger
service.
it
has
also
said
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
it
has
also
said
that
they've
treated
commuter
deficits
as
a
separate
problem
which
should
not
be
dealt
with
by
the
freight
shipper
subsidizing
the
service,
but
rather
should
be
dealt
with
by
the
local
community.
excuse
me.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
the
answer
is
yes.
it's
the
passenger
deficits,
but
no
as
to
commuter
service.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
as
a
matter
of
commission
policy.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
yes
sir.
and
that
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
that's
right.
and
i
want
to
draw
another
line
here
though.
because
in
these
rate
cases,
the
reason
they
consider
passenger
deficit
at
all
was
to
meet
the
revenue
needs
of
these
carriers.
they
needed
more
money
so
they
raised
the
rates
to
give
them
these
--
give
them
these
money
including
--
and
they
took
into
consideration
passenger
deficits.
in
this
case,
they
have
expressly
disclaimed
revenue
needs
as
a
basis
for
decision.
they
say
that
their
order
is
based
on
the
cost
of
north-south
freight
traffic,
freight
traffic.
and
they
have
found
that
the
commuter
deficits
are
based
at
least
many
items
of
the
cost
are
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
not
quite
sir.
not
quite.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
they
picked
as
their
standard
of
this
whole
case
the
cost
of
north-south
freight
traffic.
they
further
found
that
many
items
of
commuter
cost
solely
and
then
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
--
or
then
as
to
this
case,
they
nevertheless
went
in
and
put
the
whole
passenger
deficit
into
this
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
i
can't
answer
that
your
honor.
and
the
reason
i
can't
is
that
in
the
early
50's,
they
did
say
they
would
reflect
the
passenger
deficits
in
a
rate
increase.
in
1959,
they
went
to
congress
and
have
been
finished
this
passenger
deficit
investigation,
they
said
that
as
to
commuter,
commuter
deficit
should
not
be
subsidized
by
freight
shippers.
and
they
have
acted
consistent
with
that
since
that
time.
there
were
no
freight
rate
increases
from
about
'59
to
'67.
and
in
the
latest
decision,
i
just
can't
answer
your
question.
i
just
don't
know.
i
do
know
in
their
last
decision,
they
said
this.
and
this
bears
upon
the
argument
that
we
got
to
use
form
a
cost
and
these
averages
because
it's
essential
to
our
rate
cases.
in
that
case,
they
had
among
other
freight
commodities
not
merely
citrus
fruit,
but
all
perishables
from
north-south,
territory
wide,
and
somebody
put
in
rail
form
a
unadjusted
cost
with
respect
to
these
rates
that
they
were
increased.
and
the
commission
said
“territorial
average
cost
are
entitled
to
little
weight
in
determining
the
cost
of
handling
particular
movements.
and
by
that
they
mean
a
territorial
wide
movement
of
this
very
traffic.
so
the
idea
of
anything
you
do
here
about
rail
form
a
is
going
to
embarrass
them
and
all
in
their
administration
rate
cases.
that's
how
by
their
own
state
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
in
that
case,
they
were
showing
both.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
no
sir.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
it
includes
--
what
i
regard
as
a
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
the
full
cost
of
performing
this
north-south
service.
it
would
include
a
return
on
the
value
of
the
property.
for
example,
return
of
the
value
of
the
car
used
to
all
this
traffic.
that's
right
sir,
all
of
full
cost
of
handling
this
north-south
carrier.
that's
what
i
understood
the
commission
to
mean,
and
i
don't
quarrel
with
that
feature
of
it.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
yes
sir,
17%
less
than
the
north
for
doing
the
same
service.
now
let's
see
how
it
got
this
way.
i've
already
said
that
it
wasn't
operating
the
trains
and
it
wasn't
the
roadway.
it
was
a
handful
of
items.
and
i
think
i
can
illustrate
how
this
inflation
came
to
be
by
giving
an
example
as
to
one
of
these
items.
i
will
take
again
a
car
coming
from
the
south
that
moves
across
over
(inaudible)
potomac
area,
right
across
14th
st.bridge.
that's
an
interchange
point.
that's
where
the
southern
railway
comes
in
into
pan
central
and
the
b&o
goes
north.
and
there
is
a
service
performed
there.
it's
the
cost
of
interchanging
these
cars.
these
same
cars
come
in,
same
car
go
out
and
there
is
a
cost
involved
in
interchanging
them.
now
when
you
look
at
the
commission's
order
in
this
case
and
see
how
they
construct
it,
there's
a
separate
factor
which
they
call
cost
of
interchanging
gateways.
this
is
a
separate
factor.
it's
isolated
and
we
can
think
about
just
how
this
works.
the
railroad
operate
this
joint
yard
and
the
record
makes
it
perfectly
clear
uncontroverted
that
the
cost
for
each
railroad
coming
in
that
yard
and
going
out
of
that
yard
is
exactly
the
same.
exactly
the
same
and
you'd
know
that'd
be
the
same.
they're
in
the
same
yard
dealing
with
the
same
cars
through
the
same
joint
facility.
the
record
is
uncontroverted
that
the
costs
are
exactly
the
same.
the
record
also
shows
the
same
thing
at
these
other
interchange
points,
cincinnati,
evansville,
louisville.
we're
all
in
the
same
yards
interchanging
the
same
cars.
alright,
now
how
did
they
get
the
inflation?
well,
they
said,
“here
is
an
element
of
cost
of
interchange.
we
will
use
the
territorial
average.
the
territorial
average
per
car
interchange
throughout
the
south
is
used
and
the
territorial
average
throughout
the
north
is
used.”
and
it
happens
that
those
averages
are
58%
higher
than
the
north.
now
i
don't
question
that
on
the
average
for
all
the
traffic,
the
average
cost
is
58%
higher
than
the
north.
after
all,
as
was
pointed
out
earlier,
94%
of
the
northern
total
traffic
is
something
else.
it's
not
this
traffic,
it's
something
else.
it's
interchanging
with
western
lines
in
the
expense
of
chicago
district,
its
lots
of
other
things.
it's
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
they
do
enter,
your
honor.
and
as
to
those
items,
stations,
land
there
was
no
difference
in
the
averages
or
--
there's
no
quarrel
about
it.
there's
just
wasn't
--
that
doesn't
where
this
inflation
came
from.
it
came
from
just
a
handful
of
items
like
this
border
interchange
which
was
58%
higher,
these
car
costs
for
the
same
car
which
are
32%
higher
and
throwing
in
the
commuter
deficits.
it's
that
kind
of
thing
that
counted
for
this
whole
inflation.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
you
take
the
average
car
cost,
meaning
all
the
cars
of
all
different
kinds
throughout
the
south
and
all
the
cars
of
all
different
kinds
throughout
north,
and
the
average
cost
is
32%
higher
per
mile
than
the
north.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
well
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
some
of
it
is
due
to
more
specialized
equipment.
the
north
after
all
is
the
manufacturing
center.
they
have
more
specialized
equipment.
some
of
it
is
due
to
the
fact
that
the
north
uses
more
coal,
and
it
rents
coal
cars
and
coal
rentals
enter
into
all
this.
but
when
we're
talking
about
a
boxcar
handling
north-south
traffic
and
it's
the
same
car
moving
from
the
south
through
an
interchange
into
the
north.
the
same
car,
there's
no
rational
explanation
or
even
an
effort
to
explain
why
for
that
car,
it
could
be
32%
higher
than
the
north.
that's
the
whole
question
here.
we're
talking
about
north-south
freight
traffic.
and
the
question
is,
whether
there
is
any
evidence
to
support
these
higher
costs
for
the
items
where
the
whole
inflation
comes
from
and
show
they
in
fact
happen
on
this
north-south
freight
traffic.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
well
i
would
deny
it
because
i
can't
conceive
of
it
being
so.
the
northern
lines
didn't
really
try
to
show
it
was
so
as
to
these
cars.
they
just
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
if
they
did
and
if
it
was
inherent,
and
i'm
not
making
to
do
to
avoid
it.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
natural,
and
the
result
of
efficient
operations
as
to
these
cars.
and
the
northern
--
and
this
was
something
peculiar
of
the
north-south
freight
traffic,
then
they
would,
under
the
commission's
standard
here,
they
would
be
entitled
to
it.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
it's
due
part
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
partly
to
the
findings
which
go
to
the
--
where
they
don't
go
to
the
questions
of
how
the
cost
could
be
higher
on
these
cars
in
north-south
traffic,
partly
the
findings
which
don't
respond
to
that
and
in
large
part
to
the
evidence.
there
is
no
substantial
evidence
that
the
cost
of
these
items,
these
items
that
account
for
the
whole
inflation.
there's
no
substantial
evidence
or
any
evidence
that
these
costs
are
in
fact
higher
in
the
north
on
these
cars.
so
it's
both
findings
which
don't
really
address
themselves
to
this
question
and
the
lack
--
complete
lack
of
evidence.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
yes
sir.
and
i
would
--
i
think
it's
important
here
at
this
stage
to
say
exactly
what
this
court
found
in
three
or
four
sentences
here,
and
also
say
what
they
didn't
found,
because
just
what
this
court
below
found
is
critical
here.
the
court
analyzed
the
facts
as
follows.
they
pointed
out
that
only
a
few,
relatively
few
elements
of
the
cost
are
higher.
and
it's
uncontroverted
that
many
items
of
cost
are
no
higher
on
northern
railroads
and
southern
railroads.
the
inflation
is
attributable
to
relatively
few
cost
items,
and
they
list
--
the
court
lists,
commuter,
interchanging
cars,
cost
of
freight
cars
and
a
few
others.
as
to
these
controverted
items,
the
court
below
said,
and
they're
all
denying
this,
“the
commission
relied
exclusively
on
territorial
average
cost.”
now,
here's
the
holding
of
the
court.
judge
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
it
means
that
as
to
such
things
as
the
interchange
work
out
here
at
potomac
yard,
they
used
territorial
average
cost
of
all
traffic
in
the
north
and
all
traffic
in
the
south,
bulk
of
which
had
nothing
to
do
with
this
north-south
freight
traffic.
and
the
average
was
58%
higher.
so
they
divided
these
rates
just
as
though
it
cost
us
58%
more
to
do
the
same
work
in
the
same
yard
in
the
same
car.
they
used
these
averages.
and
it's
like,
in
that
point
your
honor,
it's
like
the
--
like
this
court
said
in
the
mechling
barge
case,
this
was
a
barge
rail
relationship.
the
court
said,
“the
un-sifted
averages
put
forward
by
the
commission
do
not
measure
the
allegedly
greater
cost
of
the
carriers
nor
indeed
show
they
exist.”
these
territorial
average
don't
show
that
the
cost
are
58%
higher
in
doing
this
workout
in
potomac
yard
nor
indeed
show
that
there's
any
difference
at
all.
and
the
record
shows
that's
causing
the
same
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
yes
i
do.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
no
sir.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
no.
if
you
--
if
your
question
was
on
this
traffic
they
have
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
alright.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
or
different
cars
on
a
different
something
else.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
that's
right.
not
only
shouldn't
be
used
as
a
matter
of
principle,
but
shouldn't
be
used
under
the
very
standard
selected
by
the
commission
itself,
which
was
the
cost
of
north-south
freight
traffic.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
and
it
isn't
that
i
say
that
somewhere
else
they
spend
more
on
these
cars.
it's
different
cars,
i
mean,
94%
of
their
traffic
is
different,
commodity
is
different,
traffic
or
specialized
cars.
they're
just
different
things
apparent
light
with
light.
well,
i
was
about
to
give
the
basis
of
the
decision
below,
and
i'd
like
to
read
slowly
if
i
may,
just
exactly
what
the
court
below
held.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
it's
on
349
of
the
appendix,
volume
1
of
the
appendix.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
the
commission
stated
its
exclusive
standard
to
be
the
relative
cost
of
handling
the
specific
freight
traffic
to
which
the
divisions
apply.
we
are
persuaded
that
the
order
is
not
based
on
substantial
evidence
nor
supported
by
recent
findings
within
the
meaning
of
sections
8
(b)
and
10
(e)
of
the
administrative
procedure
act,
because
the
use
of
territorial
averages
accounting
for
the
northern
inflation
has
not
been
supported
with
findings
or
evidence
relating
any
such
inflation
to
the
north-south
freight
traffic.
that
is
the
holding
below.
now,
let
me
also
quote
from
the
court
to
make
it
plain
what
the
holding
below
is
not,
because
this
morning,
it
was
suggested
that
the
court
had
substituted
its
view
of
the
case,
that
the
court
below
had
rewaived
the
evidence,
that's
not
so.
here's
what
the
court
said,
“with
the
commission's
expertise
in
mind,
it
is
our
duty
to
review
the
record
and
the
conclusions
reached
as
required
by
the
provisions
of
the
administrative
procedure
act.
as
to
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
to
support
the
order,
it
is
not
the
proper
function
of
this
court
to
substitute
its
judgment
or
to
weigh
evidence.
on
the
other
hand,
it
is
our
duty
to
ascertain
whether
or
not
the
findings
and
conclusion
are
supported
by
substantial
evidence.”
couldn't
find
a
clearer
statement
of
what
the
court's
function
is,
and
what
the
court's
function
is
not.
and
i
want
to
emphasize
again,
it
was
not
the
district
court
that
substituted
any
view
of
its
own
that
the
test
here
ought
to
be
north-south
freight
traffic
cost,
that
was
the
commission's
own
announced
standard.
this
court
took
that
standard
as
it
had
to,
and
determine
whether
there
was
substantial
evidence
to
support
this
inflation
with
respect
to
those
several
cost
items
that
accounted
for
the
entire
inflation.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
1956
cost.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
it
took
the
southern
line
six
months
between
the
time
the
north
completed
their
case
to
we
completed
our
case.
the
rest
of
this
time
was
taken
in
the
northern
lines
deciding
to
use
‘56
cost
in
1959
in
another
procedure
in
which
we
played
no
part.
i
don't
--
i
know
it's
a
great
problem
for
this
court
to
have
one
of
these
old
stale
cases
come
up
here.
i
don't
think
we
should
be
penalized
and
we
should
have
to
forego
uniform
division,
because
other
people
and
other
agencies
took
an
inordinate
amount
of
time.
we
were
not
accountable
for
any
delay
before
the
commission.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
oh,
1959
was
when
the
north
got
around
to
starting
this
really,
to
1965.
six
years,
something
like
that.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
yes
sir.
then
we'd
be
back
trying
it
out
now
if
the
commission,
i
presume,
would
not
decide
to
appeal
this.
but
to
that,
we
have
no
control
over
that.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
that's
right.
now,
i
think
i
will
emphasize
that
the
district
court
not
only
use
the
standard
that
the
commission
itself
had
selected,
north-south
freight
cost.
but
the
district
court
did
its
duty
under
the
administrative
procedure
act.
this
is
in
a
matter
where
that
court
had
any
choice.
administrative
procedure
act
directs
the
reviewing
court
shall
set
aside
commission
action,
found
to
be
unsupported
by
substantial
evidence.
that's
the
part
of
a
district
court's
job
to
the
reviewing
court
to
look
into
these
records
and
see
whether
there
is
substantial
evidence.
that's
all
this
district
court
did
and
found
none
to
support
these
inflations
and
the
items
that
they
actually
occurred.
i
also
realized
that
this
court
is
very
busy
with
many
constitutional
issues
and
it
can't
take
upon
itself
the
job
of
reviewing
these
administrative
records.
but
i
do
submit
that
the
district
court
is
the
initial
responsibility
and
it
was
fulfilled
in
this
case
in
a
well
reasoned
opinion,
and
using
precisely
the
standards
that
the
statute
required.
now,
there
was
statement
this
morning
that
this
court
had
somehow
immunized
from
judicial
review,
cost
findings
and
anything
as
complicated
as
the
railroad
divisions
case
and
citing
the
so
called
transcontinental
case
of
two
terms
ago.
now
that
just
didn't
so.
at
the
time
that
case
was
tried,
there
were
common
issues.
the
east
was
involved
in
that
case
when
the
transcontinental
case
was
first
brought,
and
there
were
common
issues.
some
of
these
car
costs
and
other
issues
were
involved.
commuter
never
was.
by
the
time
it
got
to
this
court,
the
eastern
roads,
the
northern
roads
it
settled
up.
and
this
court
observed
that
many
of
these
issues
just
didn't
have
to
be
reached
and
weren't
reached.
and
when
this
court
itself
reviewed,
because
the
district
court
hadn't
even
reached
the
question,
when
this
court
itself
reviewed
the
cost
determinations
of
the
commission,
it
didn't
say,
“you're
immune
from
judicial
review.”
it
looked
as
to
whether
there
was
substantial
evidence.
and
on
the
only
item
where
there
--
which
is
common
to
the
two
cases
that
there
was
evidence,
there
was
a
study
of
the
specific
traffic
in
that
case.
there
is
no
study
in
this
case
and
the
north
refused
to
make
a
study.
now
there
is
a
feature
of
the
transcontinental
case.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
well,
your
honor,
the
way
i
look
at
it
this
way.
the
--
it
would
be
very
easy
for
the
commission
to
get
through
with
this
case
correctly.
the
northern
lines
wanted
an
inflation
in
their
divisions.
commission
says,
“all
right,
the
test
is
cost
of
north-south
freight
traffic.”
on
this
record,
and
in
any
record
we've
seen
yet,
there
is
no
evidence
that
as
to
these
items
that
make
up
the
inflation
has
any
evidence
that
cost
more
on
the
north
on
this
traffic.
now
what
the
commission
ought
to
do
is
say
“dismissed,
you
haven't
proved
your
inflation.”
that's
easy,
dismissed.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
i
didn't
find
--
i
think
should
be
made
right
now
until
the
northern
lines
or
anybody
presents
some
evidence
that
the
costs
are
in
fact
higher
on
this
traffic.
the
findings
ought
to
be
they
haven't
proved
their
case
and
ought
to
be
dismissed.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
the
lower
court
recognized,
your
honor
that
in
saying
that
there
wasn't
substantial
evidence.
it
didn't
mean
that
the
commission
was
the
captive
of
the
northern
railroad's
failure
to
present
evidence.
that
the
commission
had
the
right
and
the
power
to
go
out
and
make
any
kind
of
comprehensive
cost
that
it
wanted.
now,
if
it
did
that,
that
would
take
time.
but
the
commission
has
no
duty
to
do
that.
the
commission's
duty
is
to
decide
the
case
on
the
record,
and
if
there's
no
evidence
to
support
an
inflation,
their
duty
is
not
to
give
it.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
district
court
said
that
the
--
that
the
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
well
i
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
no,
i
don't
think
it
did
either.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
i
don't
agree
with
that
in
this
situation
for
this
reason.
this
isn't
the
case
like
southern
case
was
15
years
ago,
like
the
transcontinental
case
was
a
couple
of
years
ago,
where
the
divisions
were
a
big
scattered
mess
that
everybody
agreed
were
wrong.
this
is
a
case
where
they
had
found
a
uniform
scale
of
divisions
to
fit
the
uniform
rates
that
are
now
in
existence.
if
this
case
is
sent
back
to
the
commission,
the
present
order
set
aside,
you
don't
go
back
to
some
chaos
that
everybody
recognize
it
has
to
be
changed.
you
go
back
to
the
uniform
equal
partner
divisions
of
rates.
now,
if
they
want
to
persist,
if
the
northern
lines
wish
to
persist
in
obtaining
an
inflation,
let
them
start
by
presenting
some
evidence
that
the
cost
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
i
mean
your
honor
that
has
contrasted
with
the
way
it
was
before
this
order
where
we
were
equal
partners.
and
we
each
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
if
they
want
more
than
equal
share,
they
ought
to
prove
it.
that's
right
your
honor.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
up
until
this
order.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
well,
specifically
the
way
it's
worked
is
that
there
are
two
scales,
a
northern
scale
and
a
southern
scale.
under
this
order
of
the
northern
scale
is
17%
higher
at
300
miles.
you
run
these
scales
through
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
$0.56
and
$0.44.
56-44
instead
of
being
equal
partners.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
that's
the
way
it
works.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
it
didn't
so
indicate.
they
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
no,
i
don't
believe
so
your
honor.
ability
to
move
the
traffic,
ability
to
meet
truck
and
barge
competition,
revenue
needs
of
the
railroads.
the
cost
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
well,
they
have
a
very
low
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
well
they
used
to
15
years
ago,
yes
sir.
but
you
can
read
these
last
few
rate
cases,
and
i'm
just
not
able
to
recite
as
to
what
they
based
it
on
it,
except
the
revenue
needs
of
the
railroads
not
cost
as
--
not
--
certainly
not
cost
of
specific
6%
of
the
traffic.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
well,
some
part
of
it
yes.
but
of
course
the
northern
revenue
needs
are
dominated
by
the
94%
of
their
freight
traffic
that's
not
this
segment.
so
it's
a
larger
more
commingle
we'd
miss.
now,
i'd
like
to
turn
to
the
last
illustration.
and
i
think
all
these
are
merely
illustrations
of
the
use
of
these
averages
to
inject
something
into
the
cost
that
really
have
nothing
to
do
with
cost
of
north-south
freight
traffic.
and
this
is
this
passenger
deficit
problem.
now
it's
--
in
the
transcontinental
case,
this
court
noted
in
an
argument
in
which
the
western
worlds
were
urging
that
their
passenger
deficits
be
reflected.
this
commission
--
this
court
said
“while
the
commission
has
sometimes
acted
to
offset
passenger
deficits
and
freight
rate
cases,
the
issues
are
quite
different.
when
in
a
division's
case,
it
is
argued
that
carriers
in
one
part
of
the
country
should
subsidize
the
passenger
operations
of
carriers
elsewhere.”
the
court
didn't
get
into
that
matter
in
the
prior
case
because
the
east
was
out
of
it,
and
they
held
that
they
--
it
should
really
dropped
out
of
the
case.
now
here,
the
commission
has
included
the
total
passenger
deficits,
and
i
think
we're
all
entitled
to
ask
how
come
and
why.
should
any
passenger
deficits
be
included
when
we're
talking
about
north-south
freight
cost?
well
the
southern
lines
theory
and
this
was
brought
out
earlier.
the
southern
lines
theory
is
that
there
are
common
costs.
taken
again
as
a
bridge
across
the
14th
st.--
right
next
to
the
14th
st.
bridge
is
a
railroad
bridge,
and
it's
got
be
painted.
it's
got
to
be
repaired
and
it's
used
by
passenger
trains
and
it's
used
by
freight
trains.
and
if
we
just
cut
out
all
the
passenger
trains,
we're
still
going
to
have
to
paint
it
and
we're
still
going
to
repair
it.
it's
a
common
cost
and
it's
proper
if
the
passenger
revenues
can't
pay
for
the
pay.
it's
proper
to
charge
that
common
cost
against
the
freight.
now,
i
don't
quarrel
with
the
commission
on
that
concept.
commission
adopted
that
concept.
they
said
that
common
cost
should
be
reflected.
i
don't
quarrel
that.
the
northern
lines,
and
indeed
commission
counsel
have
some
quarrels
with
that
in
their
brief.
they
have
quite
a
number
of
theories
of
how
this
passenger
deficit
ought
to
be
treated.
they
were
not
accepted
by
the
commission
and
many
of
them
are
inconsistent
with
what
the
commission
did.
what
the
commission
did
was
say
that
where
there
are
common
costs
that
must
be
incurred
to
provide
freight
service,
such
costs
are
properly
chargeable
to
freight
service,
so
far
so
good.
the
problem
here
is
that
these
commuter
lines
up
north
contain
many
items
of
cost,
many
items
of
cost.
tracks,
yards,
stations,
separate
facilities
that
can
be
considered
solely
related
to
suburban
service,
solely
and
exclusively
related
to
suburban
passenger
service.
those
aren't
my
words.
those
are
the
findings
of
the
commission
in
this
case.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
many
individual
items
of
suburban
service
can
be
considered
solely
related
as
suburban.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
when
this
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
that's
right.
that's
exactly
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
that's
exactly
what
we
argue.
exactly
what
we
argued
and
what
we
did
was
go
in
and
say
that
there
is
a
large
body
of
cost
that
aren't
common
and
shouldn't
be
allocated,
because
this
large
body
of
cost
are
solely
related
to
these
northern
commuters.
they
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
cost
of
north-south
freight
traffic.
we
got
our
evidence
on
that
from
a
presentation
of
the
northern
railroads.
mr.
justice
black
asked
the
question
“how
do
you
find
our
these
things?”
we
got
from
a
presentation
of
the
northern
railroads
to
congress
at
the
time
that
they
were
going
to
congress
as
they
still
are
and
saying
that
local
communities
ought
to
support
this
commuter
service.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
that
isn't
the
way
i
read
it.
they
say
because
the
commuter
deficit
includes
common
cost
which
should
be
incurred
to
provide
--
which
must
be
incurred
to
provide
freight
service.
such
costs
are
properly
chartered.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
that's
right.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
yes,
and
that's
the
point
--
exactly
the
point
on
which
the
district
court
said
“you've
given
no
reason
of
why
you
should
flip
in
the
solely
related
cost.”
yet
they
did.
now
the
other
side
of
this
question
is,
well
if
that
so,
why
don't
you
throw
out
any
solely
related
passenger
cost
in
the
south?
now
that's
exactly
what
we
suggested
to
the
commission
when
this
point
was
first
made
by
the
examiner.
we
said,
“if
you
think
there
are
solely
related
costs
in
the
south,
and
we
can
mention
those
for
you,
throw
them
both
out.
under
your
standard
of
the
cost
of
freight
traffic,
throw
them
both
out.”
and
we
would
still
--
the
south
would
still
be
better
off
from
the
way
you
did
it.
and
the
commission
never
even
mentioned
that
exception,
and
the
northern
lines
keep
saying
“well,
the
south
has
all
these.”
sure
we
do.
sure
it
ought
to
be
out.
if
south
and
north
and
ought
to
be
out
in
the
south.
and
the
commission
should
exclude
them
in
both
territories.
we
don't
question
that.
we've
urged
it.
we've
gotten
brushed
off
from
that
one.
now,
i've
given
two
illustrations.
i've
given
the
border
interchange
situation.
i've
given
the
commuter.
i've
briefly
addressed
myself
to
this
car
cost
feature.
all
these
items
are
essentially
the
same
situation.
it's
an
inclusion
in
north-south
freight
cost
of
things
that
have
not
been
shown
to
have
anything
to
do
with
this
inflation.
i
want
to
simply
summarize
by
saying
that
the
district
court
did
exactly
what
the
administrative
procedure
act
required
it
do.
reviewed
the
commission's
findings
and
it
reviewed
the
record
to
determine
whether
this
inflation
which
is
granted
the
north
was
supported
by
reason
finding
and
substantial
evidence.
without
invading
in
any
way
the
province
of
the
commission
to
set
the
policy
standards
upon
which
division
should
be
made.
the
court
below
found
as
it
had
to
find
on
this
record
that
the
inflation
was
not
supported
by
substantial
evidence
relating
the
higher
averages
to
this
source
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
yes
sir.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
yes
sir.
and
i
don't
regard
this
as
superseding
it
because
the
testimony
i
refer
to
says
that
the
great
bulk
of
the
passenger
deficit
is
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
i'm
saying
that
to
the
extent
that
you
have
to
qualify
this
by
the
existence
of
solely
related
deficits.
to
that
extent,
they
ought
to
go
out
in
both
territories.
i
noted
that
the
district
court
had
not
intruded
in
any
way
on
the
policy
decisions
of
the
commission.
it's
not
like
the
barge
railing
at
mole
case
last
year
where
a
district
court
had
decided
that
it,
the
district
court
would
decide
what
the
standard
ought
to
be.
here
the
commission
fixed
the
standard.
the
district
court
did
not
touch
it
at
all.
it
simply
found
whether
there
was
substantial
evidence
to
support
the
commission's
decision
under
that
standard.
now
we
believe
that
the
district
court
having
performed
its
duty
as
required
by
the
administrative
procedure
act
that
its
judgment
remanding
the
case
of
the
commission
should
be
affirmed.
thank
you
sir.
