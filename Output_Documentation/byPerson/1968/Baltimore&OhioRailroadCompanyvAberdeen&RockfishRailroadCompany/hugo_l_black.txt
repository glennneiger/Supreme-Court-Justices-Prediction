exclude
what?
commutation
deficits.
upon
the
theory
that
commutation
service
is
frequently
performed
over
facilities
that
are
used
for
that
purpose
alone,
and
not
used
for
freight
or
other
passenger
service.
whereas
they
said,
it
is
generally
true
that
the
kind
of
passenger
service
other
than
commutation
incurs
a
deficit
principally
or
almost
wholly
because
of
the
allocation
of
expenses
to
the
service,
for
the
passenger
service
which
are
common
with
freight.
they
say
that
in
the
case
of
the
regular
passenger
service,
intercity
passenger
service,
if
the
freight
--
if
the
passenger
service
were
discontinued,
the
cost
would
go
on
and
have
to
be
born
by
freight
service.
now,
the
commission
analyzed
the
southern
lines
contention
in
the
context
of
the
distinction
which
the
southern
lines
thus
urged
between
commutation
deficits
as
being
direct
deficits
and
the
others
as
being
allocated.
commission
found
that
although
many
individual
items
of
expense
could
be
regarded
as
solely
related
to
suburban
service
that
this
was
not
true
of
the
services
as
a
whole.
and
it
found
that
it
could
not
be
treated
entirely
apart
from
the
freight
service.
and
in
concluding
its
analysis,
the
commission
said
that
because
the
suburban
service
deficit
includes
common
cost
which
must
be
incurred
to
provide
freight
service
and
intercity
passenger
service,
the
deficits
from
commutation
service
should
not
be
excluded
from
the
constant
cost
allocated
to
the
north-south
traffic.

i
asked
you
that

been

here,
how
much,
how

one
can

that
the

can

figure

the

the

justice

well
now,
you
started
off
as
i
recall
it
by
saying
that
they
found
that
the
cost
of
carriage
for
the
northern
railroad
was
more
in
the
cost
of
the
southern
railroad?
justice

is
that
accurate?
can
they
make
that
finding?
justice

how?
justice

i
understand
that
so
far.

is
that
the
that
was

that
takes

justice

i
understand
it's
done,
but
how
much
of
it
must
we
consider
to
really
as
you
read
that
from
that
306

a
question
of

justice

how

do
they

do
they

they

what

the

what's
the

if

can
you

--

--
with
the

you

when
you've

the

out

what

what
you
claim

that
they
take

that
the

will
get

hardly
going

those

will
get
17.5%

justice

does
the

you
say
the

32%

is
that
suppose

the
fact

would
you
deny
if
they
actually
had
shown
in

that
they

that's
it.
suppose
they
did?

you

well
is
the

then
due

how

i

how

it
take
for

to
have
a
full

make
the
kind
of

you
think

obtaining

what
do
you

you

it
