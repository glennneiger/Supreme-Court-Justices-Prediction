of
course,
in
an
ordinary
criminal
case,
the
parties
or
the
state
as
prosecutor
and
the
defendant
as
the
person
under
indictment
or
against
too
much
information
has
been

had
a

is
quite
different,
in

the

the

the
applicant
is
the

in
custody
and
the
defendant

is
the

his

how
would

know

answers
to

justice
potter
stewart
how
would
the
custodian,
the
warden
of
the
penitentiary,
know
anything
about
frances,
whatever
her
name
was?
frances
jenkins.
justice

stewart
you
ask
--
you
ask
in
your
interrogatories,
appearing
on
page
34
of
the
record,
that
the
respondent,
that
is
the
warden
of
the
penitentiary,
answer
all
these
questions.
he
can't
possibly
know.
all
he
knows
is
the
conditions
under
which
he
received
the
petitioner
for
custody
of
the
penitentiary.
is
that
right,
that
he
was
convicted
probably
of
this
and
that
crime,
and
so
on?
justice
potter
stewart
and,
that
is
the
party
to
answer
these
questions
under
oath.
justice
potter
stewart
i'm
not
being
--
attempting
my
question
to
be
technical
with
respect
to
this
case,
but
i'm
stressing
my
tentative
question
as
to
whether
or
not
this
might
not
be
an
additional
reason
why
discovery
procedures
are
not
appropriate
in
a
habeas
corpus
case.
justice
potter
stewart
go
through
the
all
writs
act.
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
do
have
an
act
of
congress
explicitly
applicable
to
habeas
corpus,
don't
you?
and,
i'm
referring
to
2246
which
--
justice
potter
stewart
which
says
that,
on
application
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus,
evidence
may
be
taken
orally
or
by
deposition
or
in
the
discretion
of
the
judge
by
affidavit.
if
affidavits
are
admitted,
any
party
shall
have
the
right
to
propose
--
to
propound
written
interrogatories
to
the
affiants
or
to
file
answering
affidavits.
justice
potter
stewart
which
--
justice
potter
stewart
exactly.
well,
that's
correct.
justice
potter
stewart
but
it
does
--
justice
potter
stewart
it
does
--
well,
it
does
regulate
and
control
depositions
and
affidavits
and
written
interrogatories
--
justice
potter
stewart
with
respect
to
the
actual
hearing
in
a
habeas
corpus
case
and
does
provide,
in
these
terms,
that
such
a
hearing
need
not
always
conform
to
the,
or
follow,
requirements
of
a
criminal
trial,
that
is,
evidence
may
be
taken
by
affidavit,
for
example,
in
the
discretion
of
the
judge.
at
least
arguably,
this
means
that
when
congress
is
provided
this
much
with
respect
to
interrogatories,
depositions,
and
affidavits,
it
did
not
mean
to
provide
for
anything
further
by
way
of
discovery.
justice
potter
stewart
and,
both
those
amendments
were
made
in
the
1960s.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
how
about
this
case
in
respect
to
the
point
you're
now
making?
after
all,
we're
dealing
here
with
the
concrete
case.
justice
potter
stewart
you
say
that
you
would
submit
that
there
is
some
kind
of
inherent
power
because
of
the
broad
discretion
generally
in
this
sort
of
a
collateral
proceeding,
but
that
that
such
power
should
be
very
sparingly
exercised.
how
would
that
lead
you
--
to
what
result
would
that
lead
you
in
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
but,
how
do
we
know?
we
all
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
except
by
the
very
act
of
granting
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
interrogatories,
the
court
was
exercising
discretion.
justice
potter
stewart
he
says
he
was
fully
advised
of
the
premises
and
he
orders
the
interrogatory.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
whatever
the
district
judge
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
thought
he
was
doing
in
this
case.
i
don't
know
that
i've
gotten
the
answer
to
my
question.
justice
potter
stewart
so,
it's
your
submission
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
should
be
affirmed.(voice
overlap)
justice
potter
stewart
that's
what
i
thought.
justice
potter
stewart
i
have
a
difficulty
with,
mr.
pottinger,
is
this
--
why
can't
you
get
all
that
right
at
the
hearing?
you
have
to
make,
as
has
been
pointed
out,
you
have
to
make
an
explicit
allegation
of
the
denial
of
basic
constitutional
rights
in
your
habeas
corpus
application,
and
the
district
court,
as
i
understand
it,
has
already
granted
your
motion
for
an
evidentiary
hearing.
justice
potter
stewart
why
do
you
need
to
get
all
this
in
advance
of
the
hearing?
why
isn't
the
hearing
the
place
for
that?
justice
potter
stewart
under
the
provisions
of
2246.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
issue
here,
as
i
understand
it,
is
whether
or
not
there
was
probable
cause
for
a
search
of
a
hotel
room
across
the
bay
and
across
san
francisco
bay.
justice
potter
stewart
whether
or
not
one
frances
somebody
or
another
was
a
reliable
informant,
and
that
issue
could
be
developed
right
at
the
hearing,
can't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
what's
the
advantage
of
doing
it
there?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
would
suggest
that
you're
going
to
be
even
more
limited
in
your
interrogatories
because
when
you're
asking
the
warden
these
questions,
the
honest
answer
to
your
questions
is
“i
don't
know.”
