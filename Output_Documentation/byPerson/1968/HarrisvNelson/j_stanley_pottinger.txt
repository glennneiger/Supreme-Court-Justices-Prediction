mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
presents
the
question
of
whether
or
not
a
district
court
has
the
power
or
the
authority
to
order
the
use
of
discovery
interrogatories
in
a
habeas
corpus
proceeding.
this
particular
question
stems
from
a
habeas
corpus
proceeding
below,
instituted
by
the
petitioner,
mr.
alfred
walker.
mr.
walker
was
arrested
and
his
premises
were
searched
on
the
basis,
and
solely
on
the
basis,
of
information
supplied
to
the
oakland
police
officers
by
an
informant,
a
lady
named
ms.
frances
jenkins.
the
record
indicated,
however,
so
serious
a
question
as
to
the
reliability
of
the
informant
which
is
a
sole
basis
which
could
sustain
--
constitutionally
sustain
probable
cause.
the
chief
judge
harris
ordered
counsel
to
be
appointed
in
an
evidentiary
hearing
in
this
sole
question
to
be
held.
shortly
prior
to
the
evidentiary
hearing,
petitioner
walker
propounded
a
short
set
of
interrogatories
to
the
respondent
inquiring
into
the
possible
record
that
would
either
establish
her
reliability
or
unreliability
on
the
part
of
the
informant.
the
respondent
objected
to
these
interrogatories
not
on
the
ground
that
they
were
inappropriate,
but
on
the
ground
that
the
district
court
had
no
authority
for
permitting
their
use
in
a
habeas
corpus
proceeding.
the
matter
was
argued
and
chief
judge
harris
ordered
answers
to
the
interrogatories.
the
respondent
immediately
sought
leave
to
file
a
petition
for
mandamus
or
prohibition
in
the
ninth
circuit,
and
such
leave
was
granted,
thereby,
postponing
the
evidentiary
hearing.
the
matter
then
was
briefed
and
argued
in
the
ninth
circuit
and
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
did,
in
fact,
enter
an
order
vacating
the
chief
judge
harris'
order.
petitioner
harris
then
petitioned
for
writ
of
certiorari
in
the
cases
now
before
you
on
a
writ
which
issued
to
the
ninth
circuit.
in
considering
any
applicability
of
discovery
procedures
to
habeas
corpus,
i
think
it's
essential
to
bear
in
mind
one
indisputable
premise,
and
that
is
that
the
constitutional
and
historic
validity
of
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
today
depends,
on
a
large
part,
upon
the
district
court's
ability
to
fulfill
its
duty
to
inquire
into
disputed
issues
of
fact.
as
this
court
stated
in
the
landmark
case
of
townsend
against
sain,
the
determinations
of
fact
issues
and
habeas
proceedings
today
is
the
typical
and
not
the
rare
case.
by
giving
this
duty,
the
question
arises
in
this
case
and
in
other
habeas
proceedings
as
to
what
rules,
what
guidelines,
and
what
procedures
a
district
court
could
look
to
in
order
to
fulfill
this
fact
finding
task.
we
have
suggested
two
basic
guidelines,
two
basic
areas,
two
grounds
which
the
court
might
look
to.
the
first
is
the
application
of
suitable
or
appropriate
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
and
the
second
is
an
application
of
appropriate
procedures
pursuant
to
the
court's
inherent
power.
i
should
first
like
to
discuss
the
applicability
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
since
we
believe
that
the
controlling
rule,
that
is
rule
81
(a)
(2),
support
such
an
application
and
because
we
believe
that
an
application
of
appropriate
rules
is
preferable
and
clearly
preferable
to
a
use
of
procedures
pursuant
to
the
court's
inherent
power.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
no,
there
is
not,
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
no
--
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
no,
there
is
no
indication
whatsoever.
all
that
we
can
surmise
from
the
record
is
that
the
interrogatories
were
initially
propounded
pursuant
to
federal
rules.
however,
at
the
argument
on
this
matter,
the
court
did
not
make
a
ruling
on
the
federal
rules.
the
court
did
take
the
matter
under
submission
rather
than
ruling
from
the
bench,
and
when
the
order
of
the
court
was
entered,
it
deleted
any
reference
to
the
federal
rules.
the
order
simply
states
that
interrogatories
are
to
be
answered,
and
it
did
not
say
pursuant
to
the
federal
rules
or
pursuant
to
inherent
power.
we
believe,
of
course,
that,
therefore,
the
rule
--
the
ruling
of
the
court
is
sustainable
on
any
valid
ground
and
my
understanding
of
the
jurisdiction
of
a
writ
of
prohibition
is
that
it
can
only
issue
if
there
is
no
jurisdiction
whatsoever
to
sustain
the
order
in
question.
we
believe
that
there
are
two
interpretations
that
rule
81
(a)
(2)
will
support.
one
is
the
interpretation
given
by
the
ninth
circuit
and
which
is
urged
upon
this
court
by
respondent.
and,
the
second
is
a
broader
interpretation
which
is
urged
upon
the
court
by
petitioner.
rule
81
(a)
(2)
provides
that
there
is
no
doubt
that
some
of
the
rules
of
federal
procedure
are
applicable
to
habeas
corpus,
but
it
provides
that
only
those
rules
will
be
applicable
to
the
extent
that
the
practice
in
such
proceedings
is
not
set
forth
in
statutes
of
the
united
states
and,
secondly,
that
the
practice
is
here
to
for
--
conform
to
the
practice
in
civil
actions.
the
first
requirement
is
not
an
objection
that
we
concede
in
this
case
because
there
are
no
statutes
governing
the
practice
presently
before
the
court.
it
is
--
and,
indeed,
the
ninth
circuit
did
not
have
a
problem
with
this
first
requirement.
it
is
the
second
requirement
that
is
in
issue.
under
the
ninth
circuit's
interpretation,
the
court
has
read
the
rule
here
to
require
a
showing
that
there
is
an
actual
use
of
the
specific
procedure,
in
this
case
a
discovery
interrogatory
in
civil
actions
prior
to
1938.
and,
that
the
exact
same
procedure
was
reported
and
used
in
habeas
corpus
proceedings
prior
to
1938
and
in
that
event,
and
only
in
that
event,
says
the
ninth
circuit,
can
rules
--
appropriate
rules
be
applied
today.
we
believe
that
there
is
no
reason
to
read
the
rules
so
restrictively.
indeed,
the
language
does
not
necessarily
dictate
this
interpretation,
nor
does
the
statutory
history
which
actually
is
very
unelucidating
on
the
entire
question,
but
it
does
not
dictate
this
interpretation
either.
the
language
of
the
statute,
frankly,
doesn't
make
sense
under
this
interpretation
because
the
result
is
to
make
only
those
rules
or
only
those
procedures
applicable
which
were
already
applicable
prior
to
1938.
in
that
extent
--
to
that
extent,
of
course,
that
procedure
would
continue
on
anyway
after
the
promulgation
of
the
federal
rules,
or
the
alternative
under
this
narrow
interpretation
is
to
make
no
rules
applicable.
in
which
case,
there
was
no
reason
for
the
provision
to
be
placed
in
the
federal
rules
in
the
first
place.
so,
even
on
its
face,
this
particular
interpretation
does
not
make
sense.
but,
a
more
important
reason
for
rejecting
the
interpretation
is
the
result
that
would
flow
from
this
interpretation.
the
result
would
be
to
freeze
all
procedures
which
are
available
in
habeas
corpus
to
those
procedures
available
in
the
year
1938,
and
the
entire
history
of
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
has
been
one
of
growth,
of
flexibility,
of
permitting
the
courts
to
meet
the
expanded
needs
of
the
writ
itself
and,
certainly,
those
needs
have
greatly
expanded
under
the
issues
of
this
court,
under
the
habeas
corpus
statutory
scheme
provided
by
congress.
and,
we
believe
it
would
be
an
intolerable
restraint
upon
the
district
courts
to
be
restricted
simply
to
those
narrow
and
rather
formalistic
procedures
available
in
the
year
1938.
under
our
interpretation
of
rule
81
(a)
(2),
we
read
the
statute
to
require
only
a
showing
that
there
was
a
practice
in
habeas
corpus
conforming
to
a
practice
in
civil
actions
in
a
more
general
sense.
we
mean
to
read
it
--
we
read
it
to
say
that
if
there
was
a
general
format
applicable
on
habeas
corpus
similar
to
the
general
format
in
civil
proceedings,
then
those
rules
which
are
suitable
to
or
which
facilitate
that
general
form
that
are
available
today
under
the
rules.
in
other
words,
the
general
format
that
did
apply
to
habeas
corpus
prior
to
1938
and
to
civil
proceedings
prior
to
1938
was
the
development
and
trial
of
issues
of
fact
by
a
court.
those
two
practices
were
identical
or
did
exist
in
both
civil
and
habeas
proceedings
and
we
feel
that,
to
that
extent,
rules
--
in
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
which
facilitate
that
practice
should
be
available.
this,
of
course,
would
exclude,
for
instance,
rules
in
ci
--
civil
rules
governing
trials
by
jury,
since
there
never
was
a
trial
by
jury
in
habeas
proceedings
and
there
should
not
be
such
a
trial
today,
but
those
rules
which
are
suitable,
we
believe,
are
supported
by
the
statute
and
sound
policy
dictates
their
use
today.
for
the
same
reasons,
the
offers
of
the
restrictive
practice
that
i've
mentioned
on
the
part
of
the
ninth
circuit,
the
expanded
duties
under
the
habeas
corpus
decisions
of
this
court
would
require
the
court
to
utilize
appropriate
rules
to
that
end.
and,
indeed,
we
point
out
in
our
brief
that
this
is
the
--
the
vast
majority
of
courts
in
this
country
who
have
utilized
rules
in
habeas
corpus
have
indeed
adopted
this
interpretation
and
no
fewer
than
six
circuits
in
this
country,
over
a
period
of
20
years,
have
adopted
various
rules
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
appropriate
to
the
task
before
them.
five
circuits
of
which,
have
adopted
discovery
rules.
all
of
the
discovery
rules
of
civil
procedure
have
been
used
in
habeas
proceedings
and
reported
other
than,
i
believe
it
is,
request
for
admissions.
i
don't
believe
we've
found
a
case
on
that
particular
proceeding,
but
all
other
rules
have
been
used,
including
rule
35.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
yes,
your
honor,
every
discovery
rule,
other
than,
i
believe,
one
has
been
reported
in
use
in
district
courts
or
in
circuit
court
in
this
country.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
well,
the
full
extent
of
the
rules
but,
when
you
say
full
sweep,
it
doesn't
necessarily
mean
that
it
would
work
the
same
way
it
would
in
a
civil
proceeding.
in
other
words,
there
are
some
distinctions
in
habeas
and
civil
proceedings
which
exist
and
which,
once
the
rule
is
applied,
would
not
necessarily
let
it
be
applied
to
the
full
extent.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
all
of
the
rules
can
be
--
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
yes,
this
particular
problem
arises
from
the
argument
by
the
state
that
abuse
would
occur
if
certain
of
the
rules,
the
discovery
rules,
were
permitted
in
habeas
corpus.
i
think
that
the
basic
objection
by
the
state
is
one
of
abuse.
the
state
contends
that
most
habeas
petitioners
today
are
proceeding
in
form
of
paupers.
they're
indigents,
and
that's
true.
we
don't
dispute
that.
and,
they
contend
that
if
such
a
person
who
is
unrestraint
by
litigation
costs
would
have
the
ability
to
use
discovery
rules,
he
would
greatly
burden
the
state
out
of
an
attempt
to
embarrass
them,
to
burn
them
for
its
own
sake,
to
use
the
rules
in
bad
faith.
for
this
reason,
the
state
contends
that
it
will
be
forced
to
attend
hearings
to
obtain
protective
orders
that
it
would
not
otherwise
be
required
to
attend
or
to
seek
under
the
present
habeas
statutory
scheme.
but,
this
particular
argument
simply
does
not
hold
water.
first
of
all,
if
you
look
at
the
habeas
corpus
statutory
sch
--
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
that's
correct,
mr.
justice
brennan.
it
is
not
an
unfamiliar
argument
and
we
think
that,
initially,
the
way
that
argument
has
been
met
since
--
in
the
last
30
years
can
be
met
here,
and
that
is
that
the
rules
themselves
provide
completely
adequate
protection,
specifically
rule
30
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
which
permits
the
court
on
its
own
motion
or
by
an
ex
parte
motion
or
an
argued
motion
to
enter
appropriate
protective
orders.
pulling
aside
from
that
though,
it's
important
to
note
that
the
habeas
corpus
statutory
scheme
and
the
federal
rules
when
integrated,
as
they
presently
exist,
would
still
not
permit
any
discovery
by
any
petitioner
until
the
matter
has
been
reviewed
by
a
district
court
under
present
law.
now,
this
occurs
for
a
simple
reason.
section
1915
of
title
28
provides
that
a
form
of
pauperous
proceeding
cannot
commence
until
an
order
of
the
court
permits
it
to
commence.
normally,
that
order
is
entered
in
a
show
cause
order
when
the
district
court
has
reviewed
the
request
to
proceed,
along
with
the
petition
itself.
rule
33
provides
that
there
can
be
no
discovery
without
special
leave
of
the
court
for
10
days
following
the
commencement
of
the
action,
in
other
words,
following
a
determination
by
the
district
court
that
the
action
does
or
does
not
have
merit
in
the
entrance
of
a
show
cause
order.
rule
26,
incidentally,
governing
depositions,
provides
an
even
longer
moratorium
of
20
days
before
any
discovery
can
commence.
the
result
is
that
any
petitioner,
who
submits
a
petition
in
form
of
pauperous,
or
otherwise,
cannot
even
have
the
action
commence
under
rule
33
or
the
federal
rules
until
the
district
court
has
looked
at
the
merits.
of
course,
if
it's
an
unmeritorious,
frivolous,
our
burdensome
petition,
it
will
be
dismissed
as
it
is
today
and
no
discovery
can
ensue.
if,
on
the
other
hand,
the
petition
has
merit
and
the
court
determines
to
enter
a
show
cause
order,
section
2243
of
title
28
provides
that
the
state
must
file
a
return
within
three
days
of
that
order
--
five
days
of
that
order,
and
a
hearing
on
the
entire
matter
is
to
be
held
three
days
thereafter.
so,
that
even
--
even
if
the
matter
proceeds,
there
will
be
a
full
hearing
within
the
10-day
period
that
rule
33
would
commence
within
8
days.
at
that
particular
hearing,
and
again
we
point
out
that
there
could
be
no
discovery
even
attempted
at
this
point,
the
court
will
be
permitted,
in
fact
it
will
have
several
choices.
it
can
either
issue
the
writ,
at
which
point
discovery
would
be
immaterial.
it
can
deny
the
writ,
at
which
point
discovery
would
be
immaterial,
or
it
can
order
an
evidentiary
hearing.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
that's
correct.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
that's
correct.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
that's
correct.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
that's
correct.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
that's
exactly
right.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
that's
exactly
right.
under
the
present
statutory
scheme,
there
are
already
built-in
reviews
and
restraints
on
the
use
of
discovery
pulling
aside
from
what
we
believe
is
a
completely
adequate
restraint
in
the
federal
rules
itself,
rule
30.
so,
we
really
have
two
separate
built-in
restraints
that
will
preclude
the
kind
of
abuse
that
the
state
suggest
would
occur
in
habeas
cases.
in
addition
to
this,
we
have
to
note
two
other
experiences
with
the
rules.
since
1938,
when
the
rules
were
promulgated,
a
prisoner
has
been
permitted
to
bring
a
civil
rights
action.
and,
under
that,
he
has
been
permitted
to
invoke
the
entire
spectrum
of
civil
discovery.
so
that,
if
a
prisoner
is
really
interested
solely
in
burdening
the
stay,
as
the
state
suggests
that
this
bad
faith
prisoner
supposedly
would
be,
he
could
have
done
so
for
the
last
30
years.
and,
yet,
we
have
scoured
the
decision
and
have
been
unable
to
find
any
number
of
decisions
reported
where
this
kind
of
abuse
took
place.
in
addition
to
that,
we
have
to
point
out
that
several
circuits
have,
for
many
years
now,
applied
discovery
rules
directly
to
habeas
proceedings
and,
yet,
over
these
past
few
years
that
this
application
has
been
available,
we
find
not
cases
reported
where
prisoners
have
abused
the
availability
of
the
federal
rules.
so,
not
only
does
the
statutory
scheme
preclude
abuse,
but
experience
has
already
been
had
with
the
rules,
both
in
habeas
and
so
civil
rights
cases,
indicates
that
abuse
simply
is
non-existent.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
well,
i
think
that
because
in
habeas
proceedings
the
issue
is
not
one
of
guilt
or
innocence
and,
therefore,
it
does
not
involve
the
self-incrimination
privilege
and
because
it
is
not
really
often
one
even
involves
the
testimony
of
the
petitioner,
it's
one,
as
in
our
case,
as
probable
cause.
the
petitioner
couldn't
perjure
himself
or,
even
if
he
were
syncline,
he
won't
even
testify
an
issue
because
we're
dealing
with
the
process
by
which
one
is
con
--
is
incarcerated,
rather
than
guilt
or
innocence.
i
think
that
the
state
will
have
just
as
much
discovery
available
to
it
as
the
petitioner
will.
it,
for
instance,
will
be
avail
--
it
will
be
available
to
the
state
to
inquire
into
any
of
the
matters
surrounding
probable
cause
to
--
that
it
feels
appropriate
to
its
particular
case.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
yes,
mr.
justice,
they
have.
i
would
like
to
point
out
on
this
ground
that
this
is
a
second
objection
tendered
by
the
state
and,
that
is,
the
state
feels
that
it's
in
congress
to
have
discovery
available
in
a
habeas
corpus
proceeding
which
is
not,
to
the
full
extent,
dis
--
available
in
a
criminal
proceeding,
but
we
wish
to
point
out
that
that
objection
also
is
invalid
for
one
reason,
because
we
are
involved
with
the
process
by
which
one
is
incarcerated
rather
than
with
guilt
or
innocence.
the
reasons
for
limiting
discovery
in
some
instances
and
criminal
cases
simply
do
not
apply
to
habeas
corpus.
the
reasons
for
eliminating
it
in
habeas
--
in
criminal
cases
has
traditionally
been
not
the
belief
that
discovery
would
not
lead
to
the
objective
discovery
of
truth
but,
rather,
that
there
are
counterbalancing
considerations,
and
those
are
two.
number
one
is
the
fear
that
a
guilty
defendant
could
tamper
with
witnesses
whom
he
discovered
--
who
he
discovered
through
discovery
process
and,
second
,that
he
could
use
his
self-incrimination
privilege
to
deter
the
state
from
discovering
against
him
and,
yet
--
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
yes,
i
believe
that's
correct.
california
does
have
perhaps
the
most
liberal
discovery
provisions
of
any
state
in
the
union
but,
since
we
are
dealing
here
in
addition
with
federal
habeas
corpus,
i
think
it's
important
to
point
out,
in
addition
to
that,
that
under
any
state
in
the
country,
the
reasons
for
limiting
criminal
discovery
in
some
cases
simply
don't
apply
to
habeas
corpus.
in
addition
to
that,
it's
important
to
note
that
where
criminal
rule
16,
which
has
greatly
expanded
criminal
discovery,
does
not
fully
complement
civil
discovery.
the
inherent
power
of
the
court
does.
in
other
words,
in
criminal
cases,
even
where
criminal
rule
16
has
not
permitted
to
complete
discovery
to
the
same
extent
as
it
would
be
in
--
under
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure,
courts
have
quiet
frequently
exercised
their
inherent
power
to
go
that
last
mile.
and,
we
have
cited
cases
in
our
brief,
the
shores
case,
the
nolte
case,
other
cases
where
the
courts
have
in
fact
complemented
civil
discovery
in
criminal
proceedings.
so,
we
don't
believe
that
there's
any
valid
objection
to
extending
criminal
discovery
devices
in
habeas
proceedings
on
this
ground.
at
any
rate,
it's
certainly
not
objection
which
could
--
should
control
in
this
case.
the
state
has
--
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
well
--
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
yes,
sir.
mr.
justice
stewart,
what
happens
is
that,
in
this
particular
case,
the
warden
will
not
know
of
his
own
first-hand
knowledge.
much
information,
at
least
to
my
knowledge,
he
will
not
know
much
information
about
frances
jenkins,
but
the
point
is
that
historically,
because
of
the
development
of
the
writ,
the
respondent
has
always
been
named
as
the
warden,
the
person
who
is
in
custody,
but
the
real
party
in
interest
is
the
state.
and,
just
as
the
use
of
civil
discovery
has
been
permitted
against
nominal
parties
where
the
real
party
in
interest
comes
forth
with
the
real
information
in
question,
so
it
would
be
in
our
case
an
so
it
would
be
in
habeas
cases
generally.
the
warden
is
still
going
to
be
the
nominal
party
but
since
it
is
the
state
who
represents
him,
the
same
attorneys,
it
is
those
--
the
real
party
interest
or
those
witnesses
who
were
state
witnesses
and
who,
therefore,
should
furnish
the
information.
much
as,
for
instance,
a
trustee
in
a
bank--
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
yes,
the
warden
--
again,
he's
named
as
the
nominal
party
--
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
well,
it
was
not
construed
as
such,
i
believe,
by
the
court
or
any
of
the
parties,
mr.
justice.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
well,
i
--
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
nominally,
again,
yes.
unless
we
--
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
actually
--
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
actually
what
will
happen
is
that
mr.
granberg,
the
other
persons
whom
we
have
dealt
with
in
this
case
in
the
state
attorneys
general's
office
and
who
will
be
representing
the
state
in
the
proceeding.
if
they
are
ordered
to
answer,
we'll
secure
the
information
from
the
police
officers,
to
whom
the
questions
are
directed
in
fact.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
that
--
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
don't
believe
that
can
happen.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
we'd
have
to,
and
we
have
suggested
--
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
the
same.
it
would
have
to
be
approved
and
it
would
be
approved
for
a
simple
reason.
in
any
event,
discovery
is
not
going
to
ensue
until
an
evidentiary
question
or
an
evidentiary
hearing
required
it.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
ordinarily,
that
is
the
case
but
i
don't'
believe
that
could
be
the
case
in
habeas
proceedings
for
the
simple
reason
that
the
court
on
its
own
motion,
or
the
parties,
their
state
in
the
motion,
or
the
petitioner
if
the
state
is
seeking
to
inquire
information
from
the
petitioner,
any
of
these
parties
can
simply
state
that
no
discovery
--
under
rule
30,
no
discovery
will
proceed
until
an
evidentiary
hearing
has
been
determined
to
be
necessary
until
counsel
is
appointed.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
it
is
supported
by
rule
30,
yes,
your
honor.
what
would
happen
--
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
yes,
that's
possible,
but
i
see
no
burden
upon
that
particular
person
other
than
to
notify
the
court
that
the
notice
has
been
received,
and
have
the
court
review
the
appropriateness
of
it
which,
in
effect,
in
this
case,
means
that
the
court
would
have
two
possibilities.
the
court
can
say
--
under
without
discovery
at
the
present
time,
the
court
can
say
when
it
appears
that
a
witness
might
have
relevant
information
in
good
faith,
i
must
have
this
person
come
to
a
hearing
because
this
person
is
--
informant
may
have
relevant
information,
therefore,
any
person
who
it
is
believed
has
information,
whether
they
have
it
or
not,
is
forced
to
a
hearing.
they
must
come
to
a
hearing.
at
which
time,
the
court
can
do
one
of
two
things.
have
the
evidentiary
hearing
itself
and
when
a
person
is
found
not
to
have
any
relevant
information?
the
person
is
dismissed
even
though
the
time
has
been
used
and
the
person
has
had
to
travel
herein,
or
the
court
could
have
two
hearings.
they
have
the
first
hearing
to
determine
who
has
relevant
information.
segregate
those
who
do
not
from
those
who
do,
then
hold
the
evidentiary
hearing
sec
--
in
the
second
place.
discovery
would
aviate
this
per--
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
i
don't
believe
it
will,
mr.
justice
fortas,
and,
again,
because
the
court
could
have
--
jailhouse
lawyers
could
have
done
so
long
ago
if
they
had
intended
to
do
so
in
--
at
least
in
several
circuits.
there's
no
indication
of
such
abuse.
and,
second,
because
i
think,
as
a
matter
of
course,
protective
orders
will
be
entered.
when
the
state
files
its
return,
all
it
would
have
to
do
is
ask,
in
a
one-line
sentence,
for
a
preclusion
of
discovery
until
an
evidentiary
hearing
is
ordered
or
until
it
is
viewed
by
the
court
to
be
necessary.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
process
of
reviewing
objections
which
have
been
tendered
by
respondent
to
the
application
of
appropriate
federal
rules
or
other
discovery
devices
pursuant
to
inherent
power
to
habeas
corpus
proceedings.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
of
either
ha
--
of
procedures
either
through
the
federal
rules
or
pursuant
to
inherent
power.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
well,
that
is
to
say,
the
discovery
devices
could
be
applied
to
habeas
corpus
proceedings
by
a
district
court
pursuant
to
its
own
inherent
power
as
a
separate
ground
from
applying
those
rules
pursuant
to
rule
81.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
well,
i
think
--
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
yes,
mr.
justice,
we
believe
that,
under
the
inherent
power
authorities
that
we
have
argued,
there
are
essentially
three
separate
specific
authorities
for
the
use
of
appropriate
procedures
in
habeas
corpus.
the
one
is
the
inherent
power
of
the
court
wholly
aside
from
any
statute
or
any
constitutional
provision,
and
we
have
cited
the
case
of
ex
parte
peterson,
decided
by
this
court,
which
did
establish
that
courts
do
have
the
inherent
power
to
act
to
the
ends
of
justice
aside
from
any
specific
statute.
that
is
cited
and
discussed
--
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
in
our
reply
brief.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
to
act
and
adopt
procedures
pursuant
to
the
ends
of
justice
as
they
determine
them
to
be
needed
in
a
court.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
yes,
mr.
justice,
i
think
that
we
would
much
prefer
to
have
the
rules
applied
pursuant
to
rule
81
(a)
(2)
of
the
federal
rules
which
is
tantamount
to
congressional
provisions
since
the
rules
were
approved
by
congress.
that
is
true.
we
prefer
to
have
the
rules
extended
pursuant
to
81
(a)
(2)
as
opposed
to
having
this
order
sustained
below
pursuant
to
inherent
power
because,
while
we
believe
that
there's
no
question
that
the
court,
in
habeas
proceedings
in
particular,
has
the
inherent
power
and
discretion
to
act
to
the
ends
of
the
duties
before
the
court,
in
this
case,
to
try
issues
of
fact.
we
believe
that
it's
preferable
to
have
the
rules
applied
where
appropriate
because
the
rules
are
codified.
they're
available
to
all
attorneys.
they're
available
to
petitioners.
and,
the
entire
body
of
law
that
has
grown
up
around
the
practice
set
forth
in
the
federal
rules
of
procedure
would
be
available
throughout
the
country.
on
the
other
hand,
if
procedures
were
to
be
adopted
pursuant
to
the
inherent
power
of
the
court
and
if
that
were
the
sole
ground
for
sustaining
the
district
court's
order
in
this
court,
then
we
would
find
that
various
district
courts
throughout
the
country
would
adopt
appropriate
procedures
on
an
ad
hoc
basis.
the
decisions
would
be
scattered
through
various
reports.
it
would
be
a
lack
of
uniformity
and,
while
it's
important
to
note
that,
as
an
alternative,
inherent
power
is
an
important
ground
and
a
valid
ground
for
sustaining
the
order.
we
have
no
doubt
that
it
would
be
preferable
to
have
the
federal
rules
apply.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
yes,
mr.
--
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
yes
--
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
mr.
justice
stewart,
that
provision,
however,
most
definitely
does
not
deal
with
discovery.
it
deals
strictly
with
evidentiary
matters.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
and,
for
that
reason,
it
does
not
control,
it
does
not
allude
to,
and
it
does
not
regulate
discovery
procedures
in
habeas
corpus
proceedings.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
it
simply
is
not
relevant
to
the
present
determination.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
but
--
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
well,
we
have
--
i
suppose
that
is
arguable.
certainly,
respondent
has
argued
it,
but
we
believe
that
it
should
be
clear
from
decisions
which
have
construed
this
provision,
decisions
incidentally
which
have
been
favorable
in
the
ultimate
result
to
respondent.
but,
in
determining
this
provision,
such
decisions
in
the
history
of
the
act
and
the
language
of
the
act
itself
all
indicate
that
that
particular
section
2246
deals
only
with
the
limited
specific
procedure
of
a
manner
of
taking
evidence
for
habeas
proceeding
and
not
for
dealing
in
pre-trial
discovery.
knowles
and
gladden
--
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
i
believe
that
is
true.
i
think
that
that
would
support
our
position
that
inherent
power
is
a
valid
ground
for
sustaining
the
order
below.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
i
believe
that's
impossible
if
i
read
the
suspension
clause
correctly
in
the
constitution.
i
don't
believe
that
could
be
done.
finally
--
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
they
would
not
be
available
even
then.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
right.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
that's
correct.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
do
i
understand
you
to
be
referring
now
to
2246
when
--
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
i
think
that
that's
a
correct
interpretation
of
2246
insofar
as
it
applies
only
to
evidence,
however.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
interro
--
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
that's
correct.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
no,
i
don't
believe
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
fortas,
because
rule
2246
provides
for
interrogatories
only
as
a
means
of
cross-examining
an
affiant
of
an
affidavit.
the
court
is
not
permitted,
under
2246,
to
permit
a
party
to
proceed
with
interrogatories.
the
only
time
interrogatories
are
available
under
2246
is
in
the
event
that,
in
a
prior
determination,
the
court
has
decided
to
allow
evidence
to
come
in
by
affidavit.
interrogatories,
otherwise,
cannot
even
be
permitted
under
2246.
it's
clear
from
the
language
and
the
interpretation.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
well,
that
is
true
but,
unfortunately,
the
affidavit
provisions
do
not
permit
any
discovery.
in
this
particular
case,
there's
no
reason
to
believe
that
we
would
have
the
right
or
the
ability
to
obtain
an
affidavit
from
the
state.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
well,
certainly
not
up
until
--
it's
true
that
procedure
differs
greatly
until
an
evidentiary
hearing
is
ordered.
at
that
point,
i
believe
that
the
procedures
are
directly
parallel
because
once
an
evidentiary
procedure
--
proceeding
is
ordered,
then
we
find
ourselves
confronted
with
precisely
the
same
type
of
determination
that
a
court
and
a
counsel
are
confronted
within
a
civil
proceeding,
and
that
is
to
find,
develop,
present,
and
draw
a
conclusions
of
fact.
and,
that's
exactly
what
has
happened
in
habeas
corpus
proceedings
today
under,
first,
brown
against
allen,
and
then
under
the
mandatory
provisions
of
townsend
against
sain.
we're
contending
that,
given
that
requirement,
the
court
must
have
the
tools
to
fulfill
it,
and
the
only
tools
that
it
can
use
to
fulfill
it
are
provided
either
pursuant
to
its
inherent
power
or,
preferably,
pursuant
to
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure.
there
are
--
briefly,
there
are
three
other
objections
that
the
state
has
tendered.
one
is,
we
believe
to
be
somewhat
curious,
they
have
contended
that
the
summary
provisions
of
section
2243
require
a
speedy
hearing.
and,
for
this
reason,
discovery
would
actually
slow
down
the
hearing
and
be
contrary
to
2243.
as
i've
already
pointed
out,
discovery
on
the
contrary
will
facilitate
and
speed
a
hearing
by
permitting
the
exclusion
of
the
double
hearing
and,
secondly,
i
think
we
need
only
point
out
that
any
delay
that
is
occasioned
by
a
petitioner's
use
of
discovery
is
delay
of
his
own
choosing.
and,
thirdly,
i
think
it's
important
to
point
out
that
the
summary
provisions
of
2243
require
the
court
to
quickly
review
the
matter
and
not
ultimately
to
dispose
of
the
matter
quickly.
in
other
words,
the
review
process
must
get
on
the
way
quickly
after
a
petition
is
filed
but,
if
it
is
in
the
interest
of
the
petitioner
and
the
court
to
develop
the
facts
ultimately
to
be
determined
at
the
evidentiary
hearing.
certainly,
the
summary
provisions
of
section
2243
would
not
suggest
that
the
court
or
the
parties
should
sacrifice
the
ultimate
justice
to
be
accorded
the
petitioner
through
this
fact-finding
process
simply
for
the
sake
of
speed.
if
i
may,
i
will
reserve
a
few
remaining
moments
for
rebuttal.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
thank
you.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
may
i
first
correct
mr.
feit
in
his
assertion
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
record,
at
least
that
he
has
seen,
to
indicate
that
the
inherent
power
authority
was
raised
below.
in
fact,
it
was
raised
and
cited
in
the
brief
of
the
respondent
below,
that
is
judge
harris
below,
and
it
was
so-interpreted
by
the
state.
and,
in
the
second
part
of
their
brief
in
the
ninth
circuit,
their
supplemental
brief,
they
have
dealt
with
the
issue
by
citing
the
statement
that
an
examination
of
all
authorities
other
than
the
rule
indicates
that
there
was
not
appropriate
power.
so,
the
issue
is,
presently,
properly
before
this
court.
the
respondent
has
suggested
that
there
is
a
need
for
special
congressional
authorization
for
the
use
of
discovery
techniques
in
habeas
corpus,
but
i
think
he
fails
to
recognize
that
congress
has
already
dealt
with
the
subject.
he
tends
to
argue,
i
think
--
i
read
his
argument
to
say
that
there
is
no
room
for
any
application
of
any
of
the
rules
of
civil
procedure
to
habeas
corpus,
that
this
was
the
intent
of
the
framers
that
it
is
not
to
apply
any
of
the
rules.
of
course,
rule
81
(a)
(2)
on
its
face
shows
very
clearly
that
at
least
some
of
the
rules
are
to
apply
because,
very
clearly,
it
says
“to
the
extent
that
certain
conditions
are
met,
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
are
to
apply
to
habeas
corpus.”
the
question
is
not
whether
any
of
the
rules
are
to
apply
or
not
to
apply,
but
which
rules
are
to
apply
and
that's
the
--
that
is
the
test
that
we
have
addressed
ourselves
to
here
and
in
our
brief.
secondly,
i
think
it's
important
to
note
that
congress
has
never
attempted
to
regulate
the
whole
of
habeas
corpus
by
statute.
on
the
contrary,
sections
21
--
2241
through
45
--
54,
excuse
me,
that
is
the
habeas
corpus
statutory
scheme,
is
a
very
skeletal
framework.
essentially,
it
codified
the
common
law
procedure
which
is
a
very
widespread
and
very
developed
procedure
in
habeas
corpus,
but
it
does
not
pretend
to
regulate
all
the
procedures.
if
it
did
and
if
respondent's
position
were
adopted,
this
court
would
have
to
find,
for
instance,
that
the
appointment
of
counsel
in
habeas
corpus
is
no
longer
permitted
because
there's
nothing
in
congressional
authority
to
suggest
that
counsel
can
be
permit
--
can
be
appointed
in
habeas
corpus.
that
has
been
done
through
the
traditional
exercise
of
the
court's
power.
there
are
similar
other
exercises
that
the
court
has
taken
traditionally
in
habeas
corpus
to
facilitate
the
ultimate
resolution
of
fact
issues
and
interrogatories,
appropriate
interrogatories
such
as
the
ones
in
this
case,
are
really
no
different
in
quality
and/or
in
burden
from
those
procedures
that
the
court
has
been
permitted
to
adopt
without
controversy
for
many
years.
finally,
respondent
relies
on
a
case
of
miner
against
atlass
for
the
proposition
that
this
court
should
look
strictly
to
congressional
authority
because,
in
that
case,
the
court
look
to
congressional
authority
before
extending
the
use
of
discovery
depositions
in
admiralty
proceedings.
yet,
it's
perfectly
clear
from
the
face
of
miner
against
atlass
that
there
was
an
admiralty
proceedings
and
a
blanket
exclusion
adopted
in
the
rules,
that
is
to
say
a
blanket
exclusion
of
all
of
the
federal
rules
to
admiralty
proceedings.
on
the
contrary,
in
habeas
corpus,
such
a
blanket
exclusion
was
considered
by
congress
and/or
by
the
framers
of
the
rules
and
explicitly
rejected,
and
we
have
put
in
our
addendum
to
our
reply
brief
the
indication
that
this
was
the
case.
and,
in
place
of
this
blanket
exclusion,
congress
did
adopt
81
(a)
(2)
in
its
present
form
which
clearly
does
extend
appropriate
federal
rules
to
habeas
corpus
proceedings.
there
are
other
reasons
why
this
court
in
miner
and
atlass
decided
that
it
could
not
use
discovery
in
admiralty
proceedings
which
do
not
apply
in
the
present
case.
one
of
which
was
that
in
cong
--
in
the
congressional
adoption
of
the
certain
federal
rules
to
include
--
to
be
included
in
the
general
admiralty
rules,
congress
considered
discovery
and
explicitly
rejected
discovery.
and,
for
that
reason,
this
court
noted
in
miner
against
atlass
that
there
was
an
explicit
rejection
of
discovery
in
admiralty
which
was
tantamount
to
a
congressional
expression
of
will.
there
is
no
comparable
expression
of
will
in
habeas
corpus.
on
the
contrary,
as
i've
just
mentioned,
it
is
clear
that
81
(a)
(2)
does
extend
certain
of
the
federal
rules
to
civil
procedure.
finally,
i
think
that
it's
important
to
note
that
we
consider
this
case
of
the
utmost
importance
to
habeas
corpus
proceedings
and
petitioners
throughout
the
country.
fourth,
it's
--
if
it's
clear
that
townsend
against
sain
and
the
other
decisions
of
this
court
which
have
interpreted
the
common
law
practice
and
the
skeletal
framework
that
congress
has
set
forth
require
a
court
to
develop
issues
of
fact.
it's
clear
that
it
should
be
permitted.
the
interrogatory
should
be
permitted
in
this
case
and,
appropriately,
in
other
cases
as
well.
i'd
like
to
close
by
pointing
out
that,
in
this
particular
case,
there's
no
doubt
that
the
evidentiary
hearing
that
mr.
walker
will
ultimately
come
to
will
turn
greatly
upon
the
information
that
we
have
requested
in
these
interrogatories.
without
this
information,
it
will
be
virtually
impossible
for
counsel
to
know
what
witnesses
to
call
at
that
hearing.
it
would
be
impossible
for
him
to
know
how
to
resolve
the
conflicting
testimony
that
took
place
in
the
preliminary
examination
and
in
the
trial
which
lead
to
a
finding
of
probable
cause
but
which,
since
that
trial,
has
indicated
was
incorrectly
stated.
that
is
to
say--
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
well--
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
the
--
the
short
answer
to
that,
mr.
justice,
is
that
we
need
the
information
for
all
the
reasons
that
civil
litigants
need
discovery
to
prepare
a
trial
in
a
civil
case.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
that's
correct.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
no,
i
don't
believe
it
can.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
i
--
i
don't
believe
it
can
for
this
reason,
and
it's
important
to
look
at
the
reasons
that
exist
in
this
case
in
which
were
argued
to
the
district
court
because
chief
judge
harris
asked
precisely
the
question
you're
asking
now
and
was
convinced
that
interrogatories
were
essential.
the
reasons
are
this.
at
the
preliminary
hearing
for
mr.
walker,
there
was
an
i
--
there
was
testimony
by
the
arresting
officer
that
they
had
pri
--
20
prior
arrests
and
convictions
and,
on
that
ground
and
explicitly
on
that
ground,
the
court
found
reliability
and,
therefore,
found
probable
cause.
at
the
petitioner's
trial,
that
same
officer
could
only
testify
to
two
such
occasions.
one
of
those
occasions
turned
out
to
be
a
lack
of
a
conviction.
in
fact,
it
indicates
that
perhaps
the
information
was
unreliable
given
by
ms.
jenkins.
the
other
occasion,
ms.
jenkins
herself
has
sworn
under
penalty
of
perjury
she
did
not
give
information
to
the
police
on
it.
now,
we
have
this
direct
conflict
and,
for
that
reason,
the
court
saw
that
it
very
well
may
be
that
the
informant
who
now
contends
in
effect
that
she
was
not
reliable
to
the
same
extent
that
the
police
contend,
the
court
finds
that
that
issue
must
be
resolved.
if
we
have
to
wait
until
the
police
officer
is
called
at
that
hearing,
which
is
the
last
chance
for
mr.
walker,
and
ask
him
at
that
time
for
the
first
time
the
same
questions
which
we
ask
in
those
interrogatories,
we're
simply
going
to
have
to
take
his
answer.
if
he
says
“i
can't
remember”
or
if
he
says
“i
--“
or
if
he
distorted
or
embellished
the
--
his
testimony
on
the
first
occasion,
i'm
simply
going
to
have
to
take
that
answer.
i
will
have
no
way
to
know
how
to
rebut
it.
i
will
have
no
way
to
know
how
to
impeach
him
if
necessary.
i
will
have
no
way
to
know
what
other
witnesses
he
should
call
or
i
should
call.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
well,
perhaps
i
that
defect
or
that
technicality
is
controlling,
we
will
have
to
resolve
it
by
addressing
the
interrogatories
directly
to
the
state
under
the
theory
that
the
state
is
the
real
party
in
interest
and,
for
that
reason,
we
will
nonetheless
secure
these
answers
directly
from
the
police
officers.
but,
i
consider
the
law
to
take
care
of
the
particular
questions
at
the
present
time
because
the
real
power
in
interest
theory
would
seem
to
us
to
allow
us
to
get
behind
the
warden
to
the
real
party
in
interest
under
present
standards.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
in
civil
cases?
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
well,
there
was
a
type
of
discovery
available,
as
the
court
is
aware,
under
equity
rule
58.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
it
--
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
i
believe
in
1938
--
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
if
i
understand
the
question
--
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
if
i
--
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
yes.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
i
--
i
believe,
in
the
initial
instance,
it
was.
and,
in
that
initial
--
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
i
believe
that
it
--
the
policy
question
has
been
answered
with
regard
to
habeas
corpus
too(voice
overlap).
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
which
includes
habeas
corpus?
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
that's
correct.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
we
believe
that
under
--
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
we
don't
believe
so,
mr.
justice
black,
but
we
believe
that
in
the
event
that
the
court
is
of
a
different
mind
that,
certainly,
inherent
power
is
a
second
alternative,
one
that
is
undisputed
and
one
which
flows
not
only
from
ex
parte
peterson
but
from
the
implicit
nature,
the
implications
of
townsend
against
sain
which
was
to
command
the
court
to
inquire
into
issues
of
fact
and
to
give
the
petitioner
a
full
and
fair
hearing.
and,
we
believe
that
in
this
case,
as
i've
just
explained,
and
in
other
cases
it
will
be
impossible
to
give
him
a
full
and
fair
hearing
without
appropriate
discovery.
now,
i
believe
that
with
re
--
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
i
believe
--
i
believe
with
regard
to
the
civil
rules,
however,
to
answer
your
question
directly,
that
the
policy
decision
was
made
in
1938
when
rule
81
(a)
(2)
was
adopted
and
that
that
decision
did
include
not
only
an
application
of
the
federal
rules
to
general
civil
proceedings,
but
also
to
habeas
corpus.
and,
properly
interpreted,
the
language
of
rule
81
(a)
(2)
would
lead
the
court
to
that
conclusion.
thank
you.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
presents
the
question
of
whether
or
not
a
district
court
has
the
power
or
the
authority
to
order
the
use
of
discovery
interrogatories
in
a
habeas
corpus
proceeding.
this
particular
question
stems
from
a
habeas
corpus
proceeding
below,
instituted
by
the
petitioner,
mr.
alfred
walker.
mr.
walker
was
arrested
and
his
premises
were
searched
on
the
basis,
and
solely
on
the
basis,
of
information
supplied
to
the
oakland
police
officers
by
an
informant,
a
lady
named
ms.
frances
jenkins.
the
record
indicated,
however,
so
serious
a
question
as
to
the
reliability
of
the
informant
which
is
a
sole
basis
which
could
sustain
--
constitutionally
sustain
probable
cause.
the
chief
judge
harris
ordered
counsel
to
be
appointed
in
an
evidentiary
hearing
in
this
sole
question
to
be
held.
shortly
prior
to
the
evidentiary
hearing,
petitioner
walker
propounded
a
short
set
of
interrogatories
to
the
respondent
inquiring
into
the
possible
record
that
would
either
establish
her
reliability
or
unreliability
on
the
part
of
the
informant.
the
respondent
objected
to
these
interrogatories
not
on
the
ground
that
they
were
inappropriate,
but
on
the
ground
that
the
district
court
had
no
authority
for
permitting
their
use
in
a
habeas
corpus
proceeding.
the
matter
was
argued
and
chief
judge
harris
ordered
answers
to
the
interrogatories.
the
respondent
immediately
sought
leave
to
file
a
petition
for
mandamus
or
prohibition
in
the
ninth
circuit,
and
such
leave
was
granted,
thereby,
postponing
the
evidentiary
hearing.
the
matter
then
was
briefed
and
argued
in
the
ninth
circuit
and
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
did,
in
fact,
enter
an
order
vacating
the
chief
judge
harris'
order.
petitioner
harris
then
petitioned
for
writ
of
certiorari
in
the
cases
now
before
you
on
a
writ
which
issued
to
the
ninth
circuit.
in
considering
any
applicability
of
discovery
procedures
to
habeas
corpus,
i
think
it's
essential
to
bear
in
mind
one
indisputable
premise,
and
that
is
that
the
constitutional
and
historic
validity
of
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
today
depends,
on
a
large
part,
upon
the
district
court's
ability
to
fulfill
its
duty
to
inquire
into
disputed
issues
of
fact.
as
this
court
stated
in
the
landmark
case
of
townsend
against
sain,
the
determinations
of
fact
issues
and
habeas
proceedings
today
is
the
typical
and
not
the
rare
case.
by
giving
this
duty,
the
question
arises
in
this
case
and
in
other
habeas
proceedings
as
to
what
rules,
what
guidelines,
and
what
procedures
a
district
court
could
look
to
in
order
to
fulfill
this
fact
finding
task.
we
have
suggested
two
basic
guidelines,
two
basic
areas,
two
grounds
which
the
court
might
look
to.
the
first
is
the
application
of
suitable
or
appropriate
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
and
the
second
is
an
application
of
appropriate
procedures
pursuant
to
the
court's
inherent
power.
i
should
first
like
to
discuss
the
applicability
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
since
we
believe
that
the
controlling
rule,
that
is
rule
81
(a)
(2),
support
such
an
application
and
because
we
believe
that
an
application
of
appropriate
rules
is
preferable
and
clearly
preferable
to
a
use
of
procedures
pursuant
to
the
court's
inherent
power.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
no,
there
is
not,
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
no
--
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
no,
there
is
no
indication
whatsoever.
all
that
we
can
surmise
from
the
record
is
that
the
interrogatories
were
initially
propounded
pursuant
to
federal
rules.
however,
at
the
argument
on
this
matter,
the
court
did
not
make
a
ruling
on
the
federal
rules.
the
court
did
take
the
matter
under
submission
rather
than
ruling
from
the
bench,
and
when
the
order
of
the
court
was
entered,
it
deleted
any
reference
to
the
federal
rules.
the
order
simply
states
that
interrogatories
are
to
be
answered,
and
it
did
not
say
pursuant
to
the
federal
rules
or
pursuant
to
inherent
power.
we
believe,
of
course,
that,
therefore,
the
rule
--
the
ruling
of
the
court
is
sustainable
on
any
valid
ground
and
my
understanding
of
the
jurisdiction
of
a
writ
of
prohibition
is
that
it
can
only
issue
if
there
is
no
jurisdiction
whatsoever
to
sustain
the
order
in
question.
we
believe
that
there
are
two
interpretations
that
rule
81
(a)
(2)
will
support.
one
is
the
interpretation
given
by
the
ninth
circuit
and
which
is
urged
upon
this
court
by
respondent.
and,
the
second
is
a
broader
interpretation
which
is
urged
upon
the
court
by
petitioner.
rule
81
(a)
(2)
provides
that
there
is
no
doubt
that
some
of
the
rules
of
federal
procedure
are
applicable
to
habeas
corpus,
but
it
provides
that
only
those
rules
will
be
applicable
to
the
extent
that
the
practice
in
such
proceedings
is
not
set
forth
in
statutes
of
the
united
states
and,
secondly,
that
the
practice
is
here
to
for
--
conform
to
the
practice
in
civil
actions.
the
first
requirement
is
not
an
objection
that
we
concede
in
this
case
because
there
are
no
statutes
governing
the
practice
presently
before
the
court.
it
is
--
and,
indeed,
the
ninth
circuit
did
not
have
a
problem
with
this
first
requirement.
it
is
the
second
requirement
that
is
in
issue.
under
the
ninth
circuit's
interpretation,
the
court
has
read
the
rule
here
to
require
a
showing
that
there
is
an
actual
use
of
the
specific
procedure,
in
this
case
a
discovery
interrogatory
in
civil
actions
prior
to
1938.
and,
that
the
exact
same
procedure
was
reported
and
used
in
habeas
corpus
proceedings
prior
to
1938
and
in
that
event,
and
only
in
that
event,
says
the
ninth
circuit,
can
rules
--
appropriate
rules
be
applied
today.
we
believe
that
there
is
no
reason
to
read
the
rules
so
restrictively.
indeed,
the
language
does
not
necessarily
dictate
this
interpretation,
nor
does
the
statutory
history
which
actually
is
very
unelucidating
on
the
entire
question,
but
it
does
not
dictate
this
interpretation
either.
the
language
of
the
statute,
frankly,
doesn't
make
sense
under
this
interpretation
because
the
result
is
to
make
only
those
rules
or
only
those
procedures
applicable
which
were
already
applicable
prior
to
1938.
in
that
extent
--
to
that
extent,
of
course,
that
procedure
would
continue
on
anyway
after
the
promulgation
of
the
federal
rules,
or
the
alternative
under
this
narrow
interpretation
is
to
make
no
rules
applicable.
in
which
case,
there
was
no
reason
for
the
provision
to
be
placed
in
the
federal
rules
in
the
first
place.
so,
even
on
its
face,
this
particular
interpretation
does
not
make
sense.
but,
a
more
important
reason
for
rejecting
the
interpretation
is
the
result
that
would
flow
from
this
interpretation.
the
result
would
be
to
freeze
all
procedures
which
are
available
in
habeas
corpus
to
those
procedures
available
in
the
year
1938,
and
the
entire
history
of
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
has
been
one
of
growth,
of
flexibility,
of
permitting
the
courts
to
meet
the
expanded
needs
of
the
writ
itself
and,
certainly,
those
needs
have
greatly
expanded
under
the
issues
of
this
court,
under
the
habeas
corpus
statutory
scheme
provided
by
congress.
and,
we
believe
it
would
be
an
intolerable
restraint
upon
the
district
courts
to
be
restricted
simply
to
those
narrow
and
rather
formalistic
procedures
available
in
the
year
1938.
under
our
interpretation
of
rule
81
(a)
(2),
we
read
the
statute
to
require
only
a
showing
that
there
was
a
practice
in
habeas
corpus
conforming
to
a
practice
in
civil
actions
in
a
more
general
sense.
we
mean
to
read
it
--
we
read
it
to
say
that
if
there
was
a
general
format
applicable
on
habeas
corpus
similar
to
the
general
format
in
civil
proceedings,
then
those
rules
which
are
suitable
to
or
which
facilitate
that
general
form
that
are
available
today
under
the
rules.
in
other
words,
the
general
format
that
did
apply
to
habeas
corpus
prior
to
1938
and
to
civil
proceedings
prior
to
1938
was
the
development
and
trial
of
issues
of
fact
by
a
court.
those
two
practices
were
identical
or
did
exist
in
both
civil
and
habeas
proceedings
and
we
feel
that,
to
that
extent,
rules
--
in
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
which
facilitate
that
practice
should
be
available.
this,
of
course,
would
exclude,
for
instance,
rules
in
ci
--
civil
rules
governing
trials
by
jury,
since
there
never
was
a
trial
by
jury
in
habeas
proceedings
and
there
should
not
be
such
a
trial
today,
but
those
rules
which
are
suitable,
we
believe,
are
supported
by
the
statute
and
sound
policy
dictates
their
use
today.
for
the
same
reasons,
the
offers
of
the
restrictive
practice
that
i've
mentioned
on
the
part
of
the
ninth
circuit,
the
expanded
duties
under
the
habeas
corpus
decisions
of
this
court
would
require
the
court
to
utilize
appropriate
rules
to
that
end.
and,
indeed,
we
point
out
in
our
brief
that
this
is
the
--
the
vast
majority
of
courts
in
this
country
who
have
utilized
rules
in
habeas
corpus
have
indeed
adopted
this
interpretation
and
no
fewer
than
six
circuits
in
this
country,
over
a
period
of
20
years,
have
adopted
various
rules
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
appropriate
to
the
task
before
them.
five
circuits
of
which,
have
adopted
discovery
rules.
all
of
the
discovery
rules
of
civil
procedure
have
been
used
in
habeas
proceedings
and
reported
other
than,
i
believe
it
is,
request
for
admissions.
i
don't
believe
we've
found
a
case
on
that
particular
proceeding,
but
all
other
rules
have
been
used,
including
rule
35.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
yes,
your
honor,
every
discovery
rule,
other
than,
i
believe,
one
has
been
reported
in
use
in
district
courts
or
in
circuit
court
in
this
country.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
well,
the
full
extent
of
the
rules
but,
when
you
say
full
sweep,
it
doesn't
necessarily
mean
that
it
would
work
the
same
way
it
would
in
a
civil
proceeding.
in
other
words,
there
are
some
distinctions
in
habeas
and
civil
proceedings
which
exist
and
which,
once
the
rule
is
applied,
would
not
necessarily
let
it
be
applied
to
the
full
extent.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
all
of
the
rules
can
be
--
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
yes,
this
particular
problem
arises
from
the
argument
by
the
state
that
abuse
would
occur
if
certain
of
the
rules,
the
discovery
rules,
were
permitted
in
habeas
corpus.
i
think
that
the
basic
objection
by
the
state
is
one
of
abuse.
the
state
contends
that
most
habeas
petitioners
today
are
proceeding
in
form
of
paupers.
they're
indigents,
and
that's
true.
we
don't
dispute
that.
and,
they
contend
that
if
such
a
person
who
is
unrestraint
by
litigation
costs
would
have
the
ability
to
use
discovery
rules,
he
would
greatly
burden
the
state
out
of
an
attempt
to
embarrass
them,
to
burn
them
for
its
own
sake,
to
use
the
rules
in
bad
faith.
for
this
reason,
the
state
contends
that
it
will
be
forced
to
attend
hearings
to
obtain
protective
orders
that
it
would
not
otherwise
be
required
to
attend
or
to
seek
under
the
present
habeas
statutory
scheme.
but,
this
particular
argument
simply
does
not
hold
water.
first
of
all,
if
you
look
at
the
habeas
corpus
statutory
sch
--
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
that's
correct,
mr.
justice
brennan.
it
is
not
an
unfamiliar
argument
and
we
think
that,
initially,
the
way
that
argument
has
been
met
since
--
in
the
last
30
years
can
be
met
here,
and
that
is
that
the
rules
themselves
provide
completely
adequate
protection,
specifically
rule
30
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
which
permits
the
court
on
its
own
motion
or
by
an
ex
parte
motion
or
an
argued
motion
to
enter
appropriate
protective
orders.
pulling
aside
from
that
though,
it's
important
to
note
that
the
habeas
corpus
statutory
scheme
and
the
federal
rules
when
integrated,
as
they
presently
exist,
would
still
not
permit
any
discovery
by
any
petitioner
until
the
matter
has
been
reviewed
by
a
district
court
under
present
law.
now,
this
occurs
for
a
simple
reason.
section
1915
of
title
28
provides
that
a
form
of
pauperous
proceeding
cannot
commence
until
an
order
of
the
court
permits
it
to
commence.
normally,
that
order
is
entered
in
a
show
cause
order
when
the
district
court
has
reviewed
the
request
to
proceed,
along
with
the
petition
itself.
rule
33
provides
that
there
can
be
no
discovery
without
special
leave
of
the
court
for
10
days
following
the
commencement
of
the
action,
in
other
words,
following
a
determination
by
the
district
court
that
the
action
does
or
does
not
have
merit
in
the
entrance
of
a
show
cause
order.
rule
26,
incidentally,
governing
depositions,
provides
an
even
longer
moratorium
of
20
days
before
any
discovery
can
commence.
the
result
is
that
any
petitioner,
who
submits
a
petition
in
form
of
pauperous,
or
otherwise,
cannot
even
have
the
action
commence
under
rule
33
or
the
federal
rules
until
the
district
court
has
looked
at
the
merits.
of
course,
if
it's
an
unmeritorious,
frivolous,
our
burdensome
petition,
it
will
be
dismissed
as
it
is
today
and
no
discovery
can
ensue.
if,
on
the
other
hand,
the
petition
has
merit
and
the
court
determines
to
enter
a
show
cause
order,
section
2243
of
title
28
provides
that
the
state
must
file
a
return
within
three
days
of
that
order
--
five
days
of
that
order,
and
a
hearing
on
the
entire
matter
is
to
be
held
three
days
thereafter.
so,
that
even
--
even
if
the
matter
proceeds,
there
will
be
a
full
hearing
within
the
10-day
period
that
rule
33
would
commence
within
8
days.
at
that
particular
hearing,
and
again
we
point
out
that
there
could
be
no
discovery
even
attempted
at
this
point,
the
court
will
be
permitted,
in
fact
it
will
have
several
choices.
it
can
either
issue
the
writ,
at
which
point
discovery
would
be
immaterial.
it
can
deny
the
writ,
at
which
point
discovery
would
be
immaterial,
or
it
can
order
an
evidentiary
hearing.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
that's
correct.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
that's
correct.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
that's
correct.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
that's
correct.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
that's
exactly
right.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
that's
exactly
right.
under
the
present
statutory
scheme,
there
are
already
built-in
reviews
and
restraints
on
the
use
of
discovery
pulling
aside
from
what
we
believe
is
a
completely
adequate
restraint
in
the
federal
rules
itself,
rule
30.
so,
we
really
have
two
separate
built-in
restraints
that
will
preclude
the
kind
of
abuse
that
the
state
suggest
would
occur
in
habeas
cases.
in
addition
to
this,
we
have
to
note
two
other
experiences
with
the
rules.
since
1938,
when
the
rules
were
promulgated,
a
prisoner
has
been
permitted
to
bring
a
civil
rights
action.
and,
under
that,
he
has
been
permitted
to
invoke
the
entire
spectrum
of
civil
discovery.
so
that,
if
a
prisoner
is
really
interested
solely
in
burdening
the
stay,
as
the
state
suggests
that
this
bad
faith
prisoner
supposedly
would
be,
he
could
have
done
so
for
the
last
30
years.
and,
yet,
we
have
scoured
the
decision
and
have
been
unable
to
find
any
number
of
decisions
reported
where
this
kind
of
abuse
took
place.
in
addition
to
that,
we
have
to
point
out
that
several
circuits
have,
for
many
years
now,
applied
discovery
rules
directly
to
habeas
proceedings
and,
yet,
over
these
past
few
years
that
this
application
has
been
available,
we
find
not
cases
reported
where
prisoners
have
abused
the
availability
of
the
federal
rules.
so,
not
only
does
the
statutory
scheme
preclude
abuse,
but
experience
has
already
been
had
with
the
rules,
both
in
habeas
and
so
civil
rights
cases,
indicates
that
abuse
simply
is
non-existent.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
well,
i
think
that
because
in
habeas
proceedings
the
issue
is
not
one
of
guilt
or
innocence
and,
therefore,
it
does
not
involve
the
self-incrimination
privilege
and
because
it
is
not
really
often
one
even
involves
the
testimony
of
the
petitioner,
it's
one,
as
in
our
case,
as
probable
cause.
the
petitioner
couldn't
perjure
himself
or,
even
if
he
were
syncline,
he
won't
even
testify
an
issue
because
we're
dealing
with
the
process
by
which
one
is
con
--
is
incarcerated,
rather
than
guilt
or
innocence.
i
think
that
the
state
will
have
just
as
much
discovery
available
to
it
as
the
petitioner
will.
it,
for
instance,
will
be
avail
--
it
will
be
available
to
the
state
to
inquire
into
any
of
the
matters
surrounding
probable
cause
to
--
that
it
feels
appropriate
to
its
particular
case.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
yes,
mr.
justice,
they
have.
i
would
like
to
point
out
on
this
ground
that
this
is
a
second
objection
tendered
by
the
state
and,
that
is,
the
state
feels
that
it's
in
congress
to
have
discovery
available
in
a
habeas
corpus
proceeding
which
is
not,
to
the
full
extent,
dis
--
available
in
a
criminal
proceeding,
but
we
wish
to
point
out
that
that
objection
also
is
invalid
for
one
reason,
because
we
are
involved
with
the
process
by
which
one
is
incarcerated
rather
than
with
guilt
or
innocence.
the
reasons
for
limiting
discovery
in
some
instances
and
criminal
cases
simply
do
not
apply
to
habeas
corpus.
the
reasons
for
eliminating
it
in
habeas
--
in
criminal
cases
has
traditionally
been
not
the
belief
that
discovery
would
not
lead
to
the
objective
discovery
of
truth
but,
rather,
that
there
are
counterbalancing
considerations,
and
those
are
two.
number
one
is
the
fear
that
a
guilty
defendant
could
tamper
with
witnesses
whom
he
discovered
--
who
he
discovered
through
discovery
process
and,
second
,that
he
could
use
his
self-incrimination
privilege
to
deter
the
state
from
discovering
against
him
and,
yet
--
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
yes,
i
believe
that's
correct.
california
does
have
perhaps
the
most
liberal
discovery
provisions
of
any
state
in
the
union
but,
since
we
are
dealing
here
in
addition
with
federal
habeas
corpus,
i
think
it's
important
to
point
out,
in
addition
to
that,
that
under
any
state
in
the
country,
the
reasons
for
limiting
criminal
discovery
in
some
cases
simply
don't
apply
to
habeas
corpus.
in
addition
to
that,
it's
important
to
note
that
where
criminal
rule
16,
which
has
greatly
expanded
criminal
discovery,
does
not
fully
complement
civil
discovery.
the
inherent
power
of
the
court
does.
in
other
words,
in
criminal
cases,
even
where
criminal
rule
16
has
not
permitted
to
complete
discovery
to
the
same
extent
as
it
would
be
in
--
under
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure,
courts
have
quiet
frequently
exercised
their
inherent
power
to
go
that
last
mile.
and,
we
have
cited
cases
in
our
brief,
the
shores
case,
the
nolte
case,
other
cases
where
the
courts
have
in
fact
complemented
civil
discovery
in
criminal
proceedings.
so,
we
don't
believe
that
there's
any
valid
objection
to
extending
criminal
discovery
devices
in
habeas
proceedings
on
this
ground.
at
any
rate,
it's
certainly
not
objection
which
could
--
should
control
in
this
case.
the
state
has
--
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
well
--
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
yes,
sir.
mr.
justice
stewart,
what
happens
is
that,
in
this
particular
case,
the
warden
will
not
know
of
his
own
first-hand
knowledge.
much
information,
at
least
to
my
knowledge,
he
will
not
know
much
information
about
frances
jenkins,
but
the
point
is
that
historically,
because
of
the
development
of
the
writ,
the
respondent
has
always
been
named
as
the
warden,
the
person
who
is
in
custody,
but
the
real
party
in
interest
is
the
state.
and,
just
as
the
use
of
civil
discovery
has
been
permitted
against
nominal
parties
where
the
real
party
in
interest
comes
forth
with
the
real
information
in
question,
so
it
would
be
in
our
case
an
so
it
would
be
in
habeas
cases
generally.
the
warden
is
still
going
to
be
the
nominal
party
but
since
it
is
the
state
who
represents
him,
the
same
attorneys,
it
is
those
--
the
real
party
interest
or
those
witnesses
who
were
state
witnesses
and
who,
therefore,
should
furnish
the
information.
much
as,
for
instance,
a
trustee
in
a
bank--
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
yes,
the
warden
--
again,
he's
named
as
the
nominal
party
--
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
well,
it
was
not
construed
as
such,
i
believe,
by
the
court
or
any
of
the
parties,
mr.
justice.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
well,
i
--
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
nominally,
again,
yes.
unless
we
--
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
actually
--
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
actually
what
will
happen
is
that
mr.
granberg,
the
other
persons
whom
we
have
dealt
with
in
this
case
in
the
state
attorneys
general's
office
and
who
will
be
representing
the
state
in
the
proceeding.
if
they
are
ordered
to
answer,
we'll
secure
the
information
from
the
police
officers,
to
whom
the
questions
are
directed
in
fact.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
that
--
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
don't
believe
that
can
happen.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
we'd
have
to,
and
we
have
suggested
--
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
the
same.
it
would
have
to
be
approved
and
it
would
be
approved
for
a
simple
reason.
in
any
event,
discovery
is
not
going
to
ensue
until
an
evidentiary
question
or
an
evidentiary
hearing
required
it.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
ordinarily,
that
is
the
case
but
i
don't'
believe
that
could
be
the
case
in
habeas
proceedings
for
the
simple
reason
that
the
court
on
its
own
motion,
or
the
parties,
their
state
in
the
motion,
or
the
petitioner
if
the
state
is
seeking
to
inquire
information
from
the
petitioner,
any
of
these
parties
can
simply
state
that
no
discovery
--
under
rule
30,
no
discovery
will
proceed
until
an
evidentiary
hearing
has
been
determined
to
be
necessary
until
counsel
is
appointed.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
it
is
supported
by
rule
30,
yes,
your
honor.
what
would
happen
--
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
yes,
that's
possible,
but
i
see
no
burden
upon
that
particular
person
other
than
to
notify
the
court
that
the
notice
has
been
received,
and
have
the
court
review
the
appropriateness
of
it
which,
in
effect,
in
this
case,
means
that
the
court
would
have
two
possibilities.
the
court
can
say
--
under
without
discovery
at
the
present
time,
the
court
can
say
when
it
appears
that
a
witness
might
have
relevant
information
in
good
faith,
i
must
have
this
person
come
to
a
hearing
because
this
person
is
--
informant
may
have
relevant
information,
therefore,
any
person
who
it
is
believed
has
information,
whether
they
have
it
or
not,
is
forced
to
a
hearing.
they
must
come
to
a
hearing.
at
which
time,
the
court
can
do
one
of
two
things.
have
the
evidentiary
hearing
itself
and
when
a
person
is
found
not
to
have
any
relevant
information?
the
person
is
dismissed
even
though
the
time
has
been
used
and
the
person
has
had
to
travel
herein,
or
the
court
could
have
two
hearings.
they
have
the
first
hearing
to
determine
who
has
relevant
information.
segregate
those
who
do
not
from
those
who
do,
then
hold
the
evidentiary
hearing
sec
--
in
the
second
place.
discovery
would
aviate
this
per--
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
i
don't
believe
it
will,
mr.
justice
fortas,
and,
again,
because
the
court
could
have
--
jailhouse
lawyers
could
have
done
so
long
ago
if
they
had
intended
to
do
so
in
--
at
least
in
several
circuits.
there's
no
indication
of
such
abuse.
and,
second,
because
i
think,
as
a
matter
of
course,
protective
orders
will
be
entered.
when
the
state
files
its
return,
all
it
would
have
to
do
is
ask,
in
a
one-line
sentence,
for
a
preclusion
of
discovery
until
an
evidentiary
hearing
is
ordered
or
until
it
is
viewed
by
the
court
to
be
necessary.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
process
of
reviewing
objections
which
have
been
tendered
by
respondent
to
the
application
of
appropriate
federal
rules
or
other
discovery
devices
pursuant
to
inherent
power
to
habeas
corpus
proceedings.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
of
either
ha
--
of
procedures
either
through
the
federal
rules
or
pursuant
to
inherent
power.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
well,
that
is
to
say,
the
discovery
devices
could
be
applied
to
habeas
corpus
proceedings
by
a
district
court
pursuant
to
its
own
inherent
power
as
a
separate
ground
from
applying
those
rules
pursuant
to
rule
81.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
well,
i
think
--
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
yes,
mr.
justice,
we
believe
that,
under
the
inherent
power
authorities
that
we
have
argued,
there
are
essentially
three
separate
specific
authorities
for
the
use
of
appropriate
procedures
in
habeas
corpus.
the
one
is
the
inherent
power
of
the
court
wholly
aside
from
any
statute
or
any
constitutional
provision,
and
we
have
cited
the
case
of
ex
parte
peterson,
decided
by
this
court,
which
did
establish
that
courts
do
have
the
inherent
power
to
act
to
the
ends
of
justice
aside
from
any
specific
statute.
that
is
cited
and
discussed
--
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
in
our
reply
brief.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
to
act
and
adopt
procedures
pursuant
to
the
ends
of
justice
as
they
determine
them
to
be
needed
in
a
court.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
yes,
mr.
justice,
i
think
that
we
would
much
prefer
to
have
the
rules
applied
pursuant
to
rule
81
(a)
(2)
of
the
federal
rules
which
is
tantamount
to
congressional
provisions
since
the
rules
were
approved
by
congress.
that
is
true.
we
prefer
to
have
the
rules
extended
pursuant
to
81
(a)
(2)
as
opposed
to
having
this
order
sustained
below
pursuant
to
inherent
power
because,
while
we
believe
that
there's
no
question
that
the
court,
in
habeas
proceedings
in
particular,
has
the
inherent
power
and
discretion
to
act
to
the
ends
of
the
duties
before
the
court,
in
this
case,
to
try
issues
of
fact.
we
believe
that
it's
preferable
to
have
the
rules
applied
where
appropriate
because
the
rules
are
codified.
they're
available
to
all
attorneys.
they're
available
to
petitioners.
and,
the
entire
body
of
law
that
has
grown
up
around
the
practice
set
forth
in
the
federal
rules
of
procedure
would
be
available
throughout
the
country.
on
the
other
hand,
if
procedures
were
to
be
adopted
pursuant
to
the
inherent
power
of
the
court
and
if
that
were
the
sole
ground
for
sustaining
the
district
court's
order
in
this
court,
then
we
would
find
that
various
district
courts
throughout
the
country
would
adopt
appropriate
procedures
on
an
ad
hoc
basis.
the
decisions
would
be
scattered
through
various
reports.
it
would
be
a
lack
of
uniformity
and,
while
it's
important
to
note
that,
as
an
alternative,
inherent
power
is
an
important
ground
and
a
valid
ground
for
sustaining
the
order.
we
have
no
doubt
that
it
would
be
preferable
to
have
the
federal
rules
apply.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
yes,
mr.
--
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
yes
--
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
mr.
justice
stewart,
that
provision,
however,
most
definitely
does
not
deal
with
discovery.
it
deals
strictly
with
evidentiary
matters.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
and,
for
that
reason,
it
does
not
control,
it
does
not
allude
to,
and
it
does
not
regulate
discovery
procedures
in
habeas
corpus
proceedings.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
it
simply
is
not
relevant
to
the
present
determination.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
but
--
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
well,
we
have
--
i
suppose
that
is
arguable.
certainly,
respondent
has
argued
it,
but
we
believe
that
it
should
be
clear
from
decisions
which
have
construed
this
provision,
decisions
incidentally
which
have
been
favorable
in
the
ultimate
result
to
respondent.
but,
in
determining
this
provision,
such
decisions
in
the
history
of
the
act
and
the
language
of
the
act
itself
all
indicate
that
that
particular
section
2246
deals
only
with
the
limited
specific
procedure
of
a
manner
of
taking
evidence
for
habeas
proceeding
and
not
for
dealing
in
pre-trial
discovery.
knowles
and
gladden
--
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
i
believe
that
is
true.
i
think
that
that
would
support
our
position
that
inherent
power
is
a
valid
ground
for
sustaining
the
order
below.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
i
believe
that's
impossible
if
i
read
the
suspension
clause
correctly
in
the
constitution.
i
don't
believe
that
could
be
done.
finally
--
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
they
would
not
be
available
even
then.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
right.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
that's
correct.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
do
i
understand
you
to
be
referring
now
to
2246
when
--
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
i
think
that
that's
a
correct
interpretation
of
2246
insofar
as
it
applies
only
to
evidence,
however.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
interro
--
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
that's
correct.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
no,
i
don't
believe
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
fortas,
because
rule
2246
provides
for
interrogatories
only
as
a
means
of
cross-examining
an
affiant
of
an
affidavit.
the
court
is
not
permitted,
under
2246,
to
permit
a
party
to
proceed
with
interrogatories.
the
only
time
interrogatories
are
available
under
2246
is
in
the
event
that,
in
a
prior
determination,
the
court
has
decided
to
allow
evidence
to
come
in
by
affidavit.
interrogatories,
otherwise,
cannot
even
be
permitted
under
2246.
it's
clear
from
the
language
and
the
interpretation.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
well,
that
is
true
but,
unfortunately,
the
affidavit
provisions
do
not
permit
any
discovery.
in
this
particular
case,
there's
no
reason
to
believe
that
we
would
have
the
right
or
the
ability
to
obtain
an
affidavit
from
the
state.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
well,
certainly
not
up
until
--
it's
true
that
procedure
differs
greatly
until
an
evidentiary
hearing
is
ordered.
at
that
point,
i
believe
that
the
procedures
are
directly
parallel
because
once
an
evidentiary
procedure
--
proceeding
is
ordered,
then
we
find
ourselves
confronted
with
precisely
the
same
type
of
determination
that
a
court
and
a
counsel
are
confronted
within
a
civil
proceeding,
and
that
is
to
find,
develop,
present,
and
draw
a
conclusions
of
fact.
and,
that's
exactly
what
has
happened
in
habeas
corpus
proceedings
today
under,
first,
brown
against
allen,
and
then
under
the
mandatory
provisions
of
townsend
against
sain.
we're
contending
that,
given
that
requirement,
the
court
must
have
the
tools
to
fulfill
it,
and
the
only
tools
that
it
can
use
to
fulfill
it
are
provided
either
pursuant
to
its
inherent
power
or,
preferably,
pursuant
to
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure.
there
are
--
briefly,
there
are
three
other
objections
that
the
state
has
tendered.
one
is,
we
believe
to
be
somewhat
curious,
they
have
contended
that
the
summary
provisions
of
section
2243
require
a
speedy
hearing.
and,
for
this
reason,
discovery
would
actually
slow
down
the
hearing
and
be
contrary
to
2243.
as
i've
already
pointed
out,
discovery
on
the
contrary
will
facilitate
and
speed
a
hearing
by
permitting
the
exclusion
of
the
double
hearing
and,
secondly,
i
think
we
need
only
point
out
that
any
delay
that
is
occasioned
by
a
petitioner's
use
of
discovery
is
delay
of
his
own
choosing.
and,
thirdly,
i
think
it's
important
to
point
out
that
the
summary
provisions
of
2243
require
the
court
to
quickly
review
the
matter
and
not
ultimately
to
dispose
of
the
matter
quickly.
in
other
words,
the
review
process
must
get
on
the
way
quickly
after
a
petition
is
filed
but,
if
it
is
in
the
interest
of
the
petitioner
and
the
court
to
develop
the
facts
ultimately
to
be
determined
at
the
evidentiary
hearing.
certainly,
the
summary
provisions
of
section
2243
would
not
suggest
that
the
court
or
the
parties
should
sacrifice
the
ultimate
justice
to
be
accorded
the
petitioner
through
this
fact-finding
process
simply
for
the
sake
of
speed.
if
i
may,
i
will
reserve
a
few
remaining
moments
for
rebuttal.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
thank
you.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
may
i
first
correct
mr.
feit
in
his
assertion
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
record,
at
least
that
he
has
seen,
to
indicate
that
the
inherent
power
authority
was
raised
below.
in
fact,
it
was
raised
and
cited
in
the
brief
of
the
respondent
below,
that
is
judge
harris
below,
and
it
was
so-interpreted
by
the
state.
and,
in
the
second
part
of
their
brief
in
the
ninth
circuit,
their
supplemental
brief,
they
have
dealt
with
the
issue
by
citing
the
statement
that
an
examination
of
all
authorities
other
than
the
rule
indicates
that
there
was
not
appropriate
power.
so,
the
issue
is,
presently,
properly
before
this
court.
the
respondent
has
suggested
that
there
is
a
need
for
special
congressional
authorization
for
the
use
of
discovery
techniques
in
habeas
corpus,
but
i
think
he
fails
to
recognize
that
congress
has
already
dealt
with
the
subject.
he
tends
to
argue,
i
think
--
i
read
his
argument
to
say
that
there
is
no
room
for
any
application
of
any
of
the
rules
of
civil
procedure
to
habeas
corpus,
that
this
was
the
intent
of
the
framers
that
it
is
not
to
apply
any
of
the
rules.
of
course,
rule
81
(a)
(2)
on
its
face
shows
very
clearly
that
at
least
some
of
the
rules
are
to
apply
because,
very
clearly,
it
says
“to
the
extent
that
certain
conditions
are
met,
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
are
to
apply
to
habeas
corpus.”
the
question
is
not
whether
any
of
the
rules
are
to
apply
or
not
to
apply,
but
which
rules
are
to
apply
and
that's
the
--
that
is
the
test
that
we
have
addressed
ourselves
to
here
and
in
our
brief.
secondly,
i
think
it's
important
to
note
that
congress
has
never
attempted
to
regulate
the
whole
of
habeas
corpus
by
statute.
on
the
contrary,
sections
21
--
2241
through
45
--
54,
excuse
me,
that
is
the
habeas
corpus
statutory
scheme,
is
a
very
skeletal
framework.
essentially,
it
codified
the
common
law
procedure
which
is
a
very
widespread
and
very
developed
procedure
in
habeas
corpus,
but
it
does
not
pretend
to
regulate
all
the
procedures.
if
it
did
and
if
respondent's
position
were
adopted,
this
court
would
have
to
find,
for
instance,
that
the
appointment
of
counsel
in
habeas
corpus
is
no
longer
permitted
because
there's
nothing
in
congressional
authority
to
suggest
that
counsel
can
be
permit
--
can
be
appointed
in
habeas
corpus.
that
has
been
done
through
the
traditional
exercise
of
the
court's
power.
there
are
similar
other
exercises
that
the
court
has
taken
traditionally
in
habeas
corpus
to
facilitate
the
ultimate
resolution
of
fact
issues
and
interrogatories,
appropriate
interrogatories
such
as
the
ones
in
this
case,
are
really
no
different
in
quality
and/or
in
burden
from
those
procedures
that
the
court
has
been
permitted
to
adopt
without
controversy
for
many
years.
finally,
respondent
relies
on
a
case
of
miner
against
atlass
for
the
proposition
that
this
court
should
look
strictly
to
congressional
authority
because,
in
that
case,
the
court
look
to
congressional
authority
before
extending
the
use
of
discovery
depositions
in
admiralty
proceedings.
yet,
it's
perfectly
clear
from
the
face
of
miner
against
atlass
that
there
was
an
admiralty
proceedings
and
a
blanket
exclusion
adopted
in
the
rules,
that
is
to
say
a
blanket
exclusion
of
all
of
the
federal
rules
to
admiralty
proceedings.
on
the
contrary,
in
habeas
corpus,
such
a
blanket
exclusion
was
considered
by
congress
and/or
by
the
framers
of
the
rules
and
explicitly
rejected,
and
we
have
put
in
our
addendum
to
our
reply
brief
the
indication
that
this
was
the
case.
and,
in
place
of
this
blanket
exclusion,
congress
did
adopt
81
(a)
(2)
in
its
present
form
which
clearly
does
extend
appropriate
federal
rules
to
habeas
corpus
proceedings.
there
are
other
reasons
why
this
court
in
miner
and
atlass
decided
that
it
could
not
use
discovery
in
admiralty
proceedings
which
do
not
apply
in
the
present
case.
one
of
which
was
that
in
cong
--
in
the
congressional
adoption
of
the
certain
federal
rules
to
include
--
to
be
included
in
the
general
admiralty
rules,
congress
considered
discovery
and
explicitly
rejected
discovery.
and,
for
that
reason,
this
court
noted
in
miner
against
atlass
that
there
was
an
explicit
rejection
of
discovery
in
admiralty
which
was
tantamount
to
a
congressional
expression
of
will.
there
is
no
comparable
expression
of
will
in
habeas
corpus.
on
the
contrary,
as
i've
just
mentioned,
it
is
clear
that
81
(a)
(2)
does
extend
certain
of
the
federal
rules
to
civil
procedure.
finally,
i
think
that
it's
important
to
note
that
we
consider
this
case
of
the
utmost
importance
to
habeas
corpus
proceedings
and
petitioners
throughout
the
country.
fourth,
it's
--
if
it's
clear
that
townsend
against
sain
and
the
other
decisions
of
this
court
which
have
interpreted
the
common
law
practice
and
the
skeletal
framework
that
congress
has
set
forth
require
a
court
to
develop
issues
of
fact.
it's
clear
that
it
should
be
permitted.
the
interrogatory
should
be
permitted
in
this
case
and,
appropriately,
in
other
cases
as
well.
i'd
like
to
close
by
pointing
out
that,
in
this
particular
case,
there's
no
doubt
that
the
evidentiary
hearing
that
mr.
walker
will
ultimately
come
to
will
turn
greatly
upon
the
information
that
we
have
requested
in
these
interrogatories.
without
this
information,
it
will
be
virtually
impossible
for
counsel
to
know
what
witnesses
to
call
at
that
hearing.
it
would
be
impossible
for
him
to
know
how
to
resolve
the
conflicting
testimony
that
took
place
in
the
preliminary
examination
and
in
the
trial
which
lead
to
a
finding
of
probable
cause
but
which,
since
that
trial,
has
indicated
was
incorrectly
stated.
that
is
to
say--
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
well--
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
the
--
the
short
answer
to
that,
mr.
justice,
is
that
we
need
the
information
for
all
the
reasons
that
civil
litigants
need
discovery
to
prepare
a
trial
in
a
civil
case.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
that's
correct.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
no,
i
don't
believe
it
can.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
i
--
i
don't
believe
it
can
for
this
reason,
and
it's
important
to
look
at
the
reasons
that
exist
in
this
case
in
which
were
argued
to
the
district
court
because
chief
judge
harris
asked
precisely
the
question
you're
asking
now
and
was
convinced
that
interrogatories
were
essential.
the
reasons
are
this.
at
the
preliminary
hearing
for
mr.
walker,
there
was
an
i
--
there
was
testimony
by
the
arresting
officer
that
they
had
pri
--
20
prior
arrests
and
convictions
and,
on
that
ground
and
explicitly
on
that
ground,
the
court
found
reliability
and,
therefore,
found
probable
cause.
at
the
petitioner's
trial,
that
same
officer
could
only
testify
to
two
such
occasions.
one
of
those
occasions
turned
out
to
be
a
lack
of
a
conviction.
in
fact,
it
indicates
that
perhaps
the
information
was
unreliable
given
by
ms.
jenkins.
the
other
occasion,
ms.
jenkins
herself
has
sworn
under
penalty
of
perjury
she
did
not
give
information
to
the
police
on
it.
now,
we
have
this
direct
conflict
and,
for
that
reason,
the
court
saw
that
it
very
well
may
be
that
the
informant
who
now
contends
in
effect
that
she
was
not
reliable
to
the
same
extent
that
the
police
contend,
the
court
finds
that
that
issue
must
be
resolved.
if
we
have
to
wait
until
the
police
officer
is
called
at
that
hearing,
which
is
the
last
chance
for
mr.
walker,
and
ask
him
at
that
time
for
the
first
time
the
same
questions
which
we
ask
in
those
interrogatories,
we're
simply
going
to
have
to
take
his
answer.
if
he
says
“i
can't
remember”
or
if
he
says
“i
--“
or
if
he
distorted
or
embellished
the
--
his
testimony
on
the
first
occasion,
i'm
simply
going
to
have
to
take
that
answer.
i
will
have
no
way
to
know
how
to
rebut
it.
i
will
have
no
way
to
know
how
to
impeach
him
if
necessary.
i
will
have
no
way
to
know
what
other
witnesses
he
should
call
or
i
should
call.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
well,
perhaps
i
that
defect
or
that
technicality
is
controlling,
we
will
have
to
resolve
it
by
addressing
the
interrogatories
directly
to
the
state
under
the
theory
that
the
state
is
the
real
party
in
interest
and,
for
that
reason,
we
will
nonetheless
secure
these
answers
directly
from
the
police
officers.
but,
i
consider
the
law
to
take
care
of
the
particular
questions
at
the
present
time
because
the
real
power
in
interest
theory
would
seem
to
us
to
allow
us
to
get
behind
the
warden
to
the
real
party
in
interest
under
present
standards.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
in
civil
cases?
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
well,
there
was
a
type
of
discovery
available,
as
the
court
is
aware,
under
equity
rule
58.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
it
--
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
i
believe
in
1938
--
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
if
i
understand
the
question
--
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
if
i
--
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
yes.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
i
--
i
believe,
in
the
initial
instance,
it
was.
and,
in
that
initial
--
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
i
believe
that
it
--
the
policy
question
has
been
answered
with
regard
to
habeas
corpus
too(voice
overlap).
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
which
includes
habeas
corpus?
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
that's
correct.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
we
believe
that
under
--
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
we
don't
believe
so,
mr.
justice
black,
but
we
believe
that
in
the
event
that
the
court
is
of
a
different
mind
that,
certainly,
inherent
power
is
a
second
alternative,
one
that
is
undisputed
and
one
which
flows
not
only
from
ex
parte
peterson
but
from
the
implicit
nature,
the
implications
of
townsend
against
sain
which
was
to
command
the
court
to
inquire
into
issues
of
fact
and
to
give
the
petitioner
a
full
and
fair
hearing.
and,
we
believe
that
in
this
case,
as
i've
just
explained,
and
in
other
cases
it
will
be
impossible
to
give
him
a
full
and
fair
hearing
without
appropriate
discovery.
now,
i
believe
that
with
re
--
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
i
believe
--
i
believe
with
regard
to
the
civil
rules,
however,
to
answer
your
question
directly,
that
the
policy
decision
was
made
in
1938
when
rule
81
(a)
(2)
was
adopted
and
that
that
decision
did
include
not
only
an
application
of
the
federal
rules
to
general
civil
proceedings,
but
also
to
habeas
corpus.
and,
properly
interpreted,
the
language
of
rule
81
(a)
(2)
would
lead
the
court
to
that
conclusion.
thank
you.
