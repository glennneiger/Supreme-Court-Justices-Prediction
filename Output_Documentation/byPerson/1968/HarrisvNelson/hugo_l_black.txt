to
do
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
have
the
power
to
do
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
will
have
better
if
you
could
hang
on
to
some
act
of
congress.
justice
hugo
l.
black
maybe
no
one
else
will
be
bothered
on
the
court,
but
it
gives
me
trouble.
we're
talking
about
in
here
of
how
to
do
what
is
practical
in
legislation.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
have
one
argument
about
habeas
corpus
that
i'm
not
sure
you
make,
that's
a
constitutional
remedy
and
it
might
be
more
inherent
power,
extra
constitutional
remedy,
which
is
given
to
the
court
that
it
would
be
in
connection
with
other
matters.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
up
close
to
the
question
as
to
whether
congress
could
do
away
with
habeas
corpus.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
do
we.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
why
are
we
limited
to
that
ground
or
that
reason?
i
don't
quite
get
you.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
what
you
are
saying
is
we
have
the
power,
the
court
had
the
power,
the
court
has
power,
we
have
the
power,
inherent
power
to
do
it.
you
say,
“but
they
ask
him
to
do
it
on
a
statute,”
and
the
court
just
simply
held
that
they
couldn't
do
it
under
that
statute.
what
the
--
what
should've
been
held
is
that
he
couldn't
do
it,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
just
asked
us
to
exercise
self-restraint.
we
have
plenty
of
power,
but
don't
do
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
suppose
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
one
takes
that
up
if
we
have
the
power.
why
isn't
it
our
duty
to
do
it
if
it's
the
good
thing
to
do?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
is
about
--
i
mean,
what
kind
of
rules
you'll
have
for
taking
evidence.
you
have
seen
a
lot
of
statutes
and
rules
on
this.
they
cover
many
pages
in
very
great
detail
as
to
who
does
and
how
it
should
be
done.
is
that
what
you
say
we
have
failed
to
do?
justice
hugo
l.
black
one
prisoner
should
have
it,
why
shouldn't
all
of
them
have
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
i
--
what
i
don't
understand
about
your
argument.
that'd
be
approaching
a
denial
of
equal
protection
of
the
law.
the
law
is
supposed
to
be
general
to
abide
all
in
like
circumstances
of
all
these
prisoners
in
jail.
you're
going
to
say
that
some
of
them,
at
the
judge's
discretion,
can
get
it.
others,
at
the
judge's
different
discretion
can't.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
are
you
saying
that
none
should
get
it
under
2255?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
needs
faced
by
the
judge
or
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
needs
faced
by
the
prisoner?
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
was
the
rule
of
discovery
authorized
in
the
civil
cases?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right,
equity,
but
i'm
talking
about
civil
cases.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
the
general
rule
like
you
have
now?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
you
can
notify
a
man
in
one
day
to
meet
you
out
in
here
in
mane,
to
meet
you
out
in
california
to
hear
it
the
next
day.
when
was
that
used
up?
justice
hugo
l.
black
or
three
days
later.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
i'm
getting
at,
that
was
a
serious
question
of
policy,
wasn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
may
say
that
--
i
don't
mean
i
share
in
it,
but
i've
heard
more
criticism
of
the
dignity,
of
the
suffering
of
people
under
that
rule
of
discovery
than
any
other
civil
rule
that's
been
up
to,
and
it's
a
question
of
policy,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so,
you
don't
think
it
is
now?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
why
the
questions
on
those
had
been
answered
with
reference
to
it,
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
you
say
then
that
the
rule
applies.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
your
argument
that
the
rule
applies.
justice
hugo
l.
black
we
don't
have
to
make
up
any
out
of
our
inherent
powers
to
legislate.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you've
made
a
good
argument
for
him.
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
do
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
have
the
power
