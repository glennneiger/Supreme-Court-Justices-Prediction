mr.
derald
e.
granberg
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i'd
like
to
direct
my
remarks
initially
to
petitioner's
argument
that
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
authorize
the
use
of
the
discovery
mechanism
provided
therein
to
a
habeas
proceeding.
this,
of
course,
turns
on
the
construction
to
be
accorded
to
rule
81
(a)
(2)
of
those
rules
which
provides
simply,
these
rules
are
applicable
to
proceedings
for
admission
to
citizenship
habeas
corpus
and
quo
warranto,
to
the
extent
that
the
practice
in
such
proceedings
is
not
set
forth
in
statutes
of
the
united
states
and
is
here
to
conform
to
the
practice
in
civil
actions.
this
imposes
two
conditions,
and
we
will
argue
later
that
neither
these
conditions
can
be
met.
before
i
reach
that
argument,
however,
i
would
like
to
present
some
remarks
with
respect
to
what
i
feel
this
evidence
is
as
to
the
purpose
of
the
original
framers
of
these
rules
back
in
1938.
first
of
all,
i
believe
we
could
discern
that
it
makes
it
perfectly
apparent
that
the
framers
of
the
rules
recognized
that
procedures,
with
respect
to
habeas
corpus,
are
set
forth
in
the
statute.
secondly,
it
expresses
a
clear
intention
that
procedures,
with
respect
to
habeas
corpus,
are
to
be
controlled
by
statutory
changes
as
well.
it
is
any
of
that
that
a
statutory
change
occurs
with
respect
to
procedure.
that
is
to
control.
and,
finally,
with
respect
to
that
second
condition,
by
it
conforming
to
the
practice
prior
to
1938,
that
offense
is
a
clear
intention
not
to
change
existing
practice
in
habeas
corpus.
a
clear
intention
to
maintain
a
few
were
status
quo
with
respect
to
habeas
practice
as
it
existed
in
1938,
and
not
to
freeze
it
there
but
to
leave
any
changes
that
are
to
occur
to
congress
through
the
statutory
changes
that
it
sees
fit
to
make.
now,
certainly,
congress
has,
since
that
time,
affected
changes
with
respect
to
habeas
procedure.
the
--
this
recent
--
excuse
me.
the
most
recent
evidence
of
that
can
be
found
in
section
2241,
an
enactment
there
in
1966,
an
enactment
in
2254
in
1966,
enactments
which
significantly
affect
procedure
with
respect
to
habeas
proceedings.
i
believe
that
this
--
mr.
derald
e.
granberg
2241
relates
essentially
to
jurisdiction
and
provides
that
when
you
have
a
state
with
more
than
one
federal
judicial
district,
a
habeas
petition
can
be
entertained
either
in
a
district
within
which
the
petitioner
is
confined
or
the
district
within
which
a
state
criminal
conviction
and
sentence
occurred.
now,
2254
provides
significant
changes
with
respect
to
the
presumption
of
correctness
which
is
to
attend
a
state
factual
determination
reached
after
a
hearing
and
reflected
by
written
indicia
or
findings.
mr.
derald
e.
granberg
1966,
yes,
your
honor.
now,
i
believe
that
this
policy
decision
reflected
in
rule
81
(a)
(2),
as
of
1938,
is
a
very
sound
one,
but
it
was
sound
when
made
and
it
remains
sound
today.
first
of
all,
pleading
in
procedure
in
habeas
corpus
is
completely
inconsistent
with
pleading
procedure
as
it
exists
now
under
the
conventional
rules
of
practice
for
a
civil
litigation.
and,
a
habeas
petitioner
is
required
to
allege
with
particularity,
those
facts
upon
which
he
relies,
and
which
if
established,
would
justify
him
to
relate.
when
congress
introduced
the
discovery
procedure
through
the
civil
rules
in
1938,
it
affronted
what
this
court
referred
to
as
one
of
the
most
significant
innovations
of
those
rules
yet.
those
rules
came
in
along
with
substantial
changes
with
respect
to
pleading
in
civil
actions
as
well
as
simplified
pleading.
and,
part
of
a
justification
for
the
change
in
pleading
exists
in
the
fact
that
the
discovery
techniques
are
afforded
to
the
parties
to
be
exercised
by
the
parties
for
the
purposes
of
defining
issues,
for
fact
revelation,
and
such
similar
purposes.
now,
the
justification
with
this
discovery
procedure
lies
certainly
in
part
in
these
pleading
changes
which
occurred
as
well,
simplified
pleadings,
streamlined
pleading.
yet,
these
pleading
changes
have
no
pertinence
whatever
with
respect
to
a
habeas
proceeding.
now,
i
believe
a
second
sound
reason
why
the
framers
sought
that
not
to
extent
these
civil
rules
with
respect
to
the
discovery
mechanism
to
a
habeas
proceeding
is
this.
it's
completely
inconsistent
with
the
summary
nature
of
a
habeas
proceeding.
now,
when
i
say
summary,
certainly,
i'm
talking
in
terms
of
affording
quick
relief
to
a
petitioner.
i'm
talking
about
other
reasons
as
well.
such
factors
as
minimizing
the
impact
on
a
state
rehabilitated
process,
such
factors
as
minimizing
the
impact
of
the
burden
of
habeas
applications
upon
the
federal
courts
as
well.
there
are
techniques
for
resolving
these
petitions
for
disposing
of
them
without
proceeding
through
a
hearing.
certainly,
if
petitioner
has
failed
to
allege
these
specific
facts
as
inserted
only
conclusory
allegations
in
stating
his
claim
for
relief,
he's
not
entitled
to
a
hearing.
the
petition
is
entitled
to
be
dismissed.
another
sound
policy
consideration,
i
think,
that
existed
in
1938
and,
certainly,
that
continues
today
is
the
fact
that
in
no
criminal
discovery
system
that
has
been
initiated
within
any
state
or
within
the
federal
system
does
anything
akin
to
this
civil
discovery
mechanism
exist,
nothing
that
even
approximates.
now
certainly,
california,
in
the
field
of
criminal
discovery,
has
gone
as
far
as
anyone
has,
perhaps
much
further.
now,
we
afford
to
a
defendant
copies
of
any
statements
he's
made,
copies
of
other
witnesses,
copies
relating
to
physical
tests,
copies
relating
to
examination
of
scientific
evidence.
factors
such
as
these,
for
a
long
time,
we've
given
them
copies
of
the
grand
jury
transcript
that
has
been
indicted.
he's
afforded
a
copy
of
the
transcript
of
the
preliminary
hearing
if
he's
held
to
answer
through
the
information
process.
yet,
california
has
specifically
rejected
efforts
to
utilize
depositions
for
purposes
of
discovery
or
interrogatories
for
purposes
of
discovery.
it's
a
system
which
is
simply
foreign
to
the
procedure
and
its'
been
recognized
as
such
and
rejected.
and,
i
submit
that
it
is
just
as
foreign
within
the
context
of
a
habeas
proceeding.
mr.
derald
e.
granberg
yes,
your
honor.
usually,
it's
done
informally.
frequently,
it's
done
pursuant
to
order
of
the
court,
but
it
is
accepted
practice.
mr.
derald
e.
granberg
no,
your
honor.
mr.
derald
e.
granberg
discovery
in
criminal
practice
in
california
is
not
a
creature
of
statute.
it's
a
creature
of
judicial
decision.
mr.
derald
e.
granberg
it
is
not
recognized
by
a
statute,
but
the
court
appropriately
recognized
that
the
provisions,
with
respect
to
civil
discovery,
have
no
applicability
to
criminal
cases.
finally,
i
believe
that
this
policy
decision
made
back
in
1938
was
found
and
remain
sound
for
further
reason.
when
you
balance
the
potential
for
abuse
which
exists
here
against
the
value
--
potential
value
of
the
procedure
to
petitioners,
i
think
it
becomes
perfectly
apparent
that
the
increase
in
litigation
increased
burden
on
states
attorneys.
the
dangers
of
harassment
with
respect
to
witnesses,
arresting
officers,
prosecuting
attorneys,
perhaps
even
defense
attorneys,
should
the
procedure
be
made
available,
indicates
a
sound
reason
for
not
extending
civil
discovery
to
habeas
proceedings.
i'd
like
to
turn
now
for
a
moment
to
the
specific
condition
set
forth
in
section
81
(a)
(2),
and
i
will
argue
that
the
first
condition
cannot
be
met,
that
is,
there
cannot
be
a
showing
that
practice
is
not
controlled
by
a
statute.
practice
was
respect
to
depositions
and
interrogatory
is
controlled
by
a
statute
within
the
habeas
act.
section
2246
accomplishes
this.
depositions
may
be
utilized
for
evidence.
judicially,
in
the
ninth
circuit,
and
i
refer
now
to
the
wilson
versus
weigel,
the
court
has
indicated
that
depositions,
as
the
term
is
used
in
2246,
includes
also
depositions
on
written
interrogatories.
now,
that's
not
an
acceptance
of
the
applicability
of
the
civil
rules.
it's
simply
a
recognition
that
one
appropriate
way
of
taking
a
deposition
is
by
written
interrogatories.
of
course,
this
follows
a
procedure
very
much
akin
to
that
set
out
in
section
31
of
the
federal
civil
rules.
but,
in
any
event,
2246
limits
depositions
to
evidentiary
purposes.
in
wilson
versus
weigel,
the
ninth
circuit
was
asked
to
extend
or
to
reconsider
the
decision
that
is
now
here
before
this
court
in
wilson
versus
harris
and
change
its
mind,
but
it
did
not.
it
said
depositions
can
be
taken
under
section
2246
and
that
it
cannot
be
taken
under
rule
26
(a)
of
the
federal
civil
rules
for
purposes
of
discovery.
and,
if
objections
are
to
be
made
to
specific
questions,
then
this
is
the
appropriate
matter
--
appropriate
approach
to
take
but,
nevertheless,
it
refused
to
extend
the
federal
civil
rules
to
a
habeas
proceeding.
it
adhered
to
the
decision
that
it
entered
earlier
in
this
case
here
in
issue.
now,
i
think
it's
extremely
significant
the
manner
in
which
section
2246
regulates
deposition
in
interrogatory
practice
and
the
fact
that
this
was
enacted.
2246
was
added
in
1948,
a
full
10
years
after
the
federal
civil
rules
have
been
adopted.
yet,
not
only
do
we
have
the
inconsistency
between
rule
26
through
37
of
the
federal
civil
rules
that
added
2246
of
the
habeas
act
that
depositions,
interrogatories,
and
so
forth
are
not
permitted
for
discovery
in
habeas
actions,
but
we
also
have
inconsistencies
with
respect
to
the
use
which
may
be
made
of
depositions
taken
or
interrogatories,
if
you
will,
for
purposes
of
evidence
at
a
trial.
under
2246,
the
section
provides
simply
that
depositions
may
be
taken
for
use
as
evidence,
may
be
utilized
in
taking
evidence
at
a
habeas
proceeding.
rule
26
(a),
on
the
other
hand,
provides
a
number
of
conditions
with
respect
to
the
utilization
which
can
be
made
at
trial
of
depositions
taken
pursuant
to
them.
again,
when
congress
added
2246
in
1948,
i
submit,
it
specifically
rejected
any
suggestion
that
discovery
techniques
such
those
found
in
the
civil
rules
should
be
applicable
in
a
habeas
proceeding.
mr.
derald
e.
granberg
the
legislative
history
which
we
encountered
with
respect
to
2246
deals
solely
with
the
techniques
of
taking
evidence.
there's
no
discussion
that
we
have
been
able
to
find
with
respect
to
discovery.
it
does
make
the
point
that
the
use
of
written
interrogatories
under
2246,
as
it
appears
there,
is
limited
to
what
--
to
offering
something
in
akin
to
cross-examination
of
one
who
has
presented
an
affidavit.
that
is,
under
the
section
literally,
written
interrogatories
can
be
used
only
against
an
individual
who
has
presented
an
affidavit
for
use
in
evidence,
technique
of
testing
the
evidence
in
that
way.
finally,
turning
to
the
second
condition
with
respect
to
former
practice,
there
simply
can't
be
no
showing
made
that
anything,
even
a
perch,
the
discovery
mechanism
found
in
the
federal
rules
in
civil
procedure
existed
in
the
habeas
proceedings
in
1938.
i
would
submit
that
there
can
be
no
showing
that
any
discovery
practice
existed
in
habeas
court
in
1938.
the
purpose
expressed
in
maintaining
status
quo
certainly
militates
against
any
finding
that
the
second
condition
can
be
met.
mr.
derald
e.
granberg
yes?
mr.
derald
e.
granberg
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
derald
e.
granberg
in
1948.
mr.
derald
e.
granberg
your
honor,
that
should
be
found
starting
at
about
page
19.
mr.
derald
e.
granberg
now,
i
would
submit
that
this
absence
of
authority
to
make
any
showing
prior
discovery
practice
in
habeas
proceedings,
prior
to
1948
that
is,
is
extremely
significant.
certainly,
this
absence
of
authority
was
viewed
as
one
of
the
factors
which
lead
this
court
to
conclude
in
miner
versus
atlass
that
there
was
no
traditional
inherent
power
if
you
were
to
order
depositions
or
to
authorize
deposition
for
discovery
purposes
in
an
admiralty
proceeding.
now,
as
the
court
noted
specifically
that
there
was
no
indication,
the
traditional
practice
in
this
regard.
turning
to
the
argument
that,
apart
from
the
civil
rules,
the
court
have
some
sort
of
inherent
power
to
authorize
and
implement
and
sanction
or
fashion,
if
you
were,
a
discovery
procedure
akin
to
that
found
in
the
civil
rules,
i
submit
that
this
is
simply
not
an
appropriate
area
for
an
exercise
of
inherent
power.
one
of
the
justifications
that
had
been
offered
to
this
court
by
a
petitioner
is
that
such
a
power
can
be
found
within
the
habeas
statutes
themselves.
the
hearing
requirement
impose
by
section
2243
is
summarily
here
and
resolved.
i
submit
that
that
affords
no
basis
for
implementing
or
for
permitting
district
courts
to
implement,
if
you
were,
discovery
practice
in
akin
to
this.
now,
certainly,
2246
within
the
habeas
statutes
affords
no
basis
for
implementing
a
discovery
practice
into
this.
the
time
provisions
filed
within
2243,
the
time
requirements,
are
completely
at
odds
with
implanting
a
discovery
procedure
akin
to
that
found
in
the
federal
civil
rules.
as
we've
argued
earlier,
the
plating
requirements
with
respect
to
habeas
are
completely
inconsistent
with
implementing
a
discovery
procedure.
an
applicant's
required
to
plead
and
assert,
with
particularity,
those
factual
matters
upon
which
he
would
rely
on
seeking
relief.
and,
it's
also
significant
to
note
that
the
habeas
statutes
do
deal
with
the
production
of
records,
documents,
and
that
this
offers
one
additional
reason
for
finding
a
real
necessity
for
civil
discovery
techniques
in
a
habeas
proceeding.
one
of
the
requirements
with
respect
to
a
habeas
applicant
in
the
federal
courts
is
that
he
had
exhausted
state
remedies
before
he
reaches
the
federal
courts
or
before
the
federal
courts,
at
least
as
a
matter
of
committee,
assume
jurisdiction.
224
--
2254
of
the
habeas
statutes
now
provides,
when
a
factual
determination
has
been
made
by
a
state
court
and
it's
been
made
after
a
hearing
on
the
merits,
it's
entitled
to
a
presumption
of
correctives.
and,
if
an
issue
passes
through
the
state
courts
and
reaches
the
federal
courts
and
those
records
become
significant,
2254
also
provides
a
means
whereby
those
records
--
court
records
and
materials
relating
to
the
factual
determination
can
be
brought
before
the
federal
court
and
be
relied
upon
in
resolving
the
petition.
insofar
as
any
suggestion
that
an
inherent
power
may
be
found
apart
from
the
habeas
statutes,
just
kind
of
a
vague
general
inherent
power,
i
would
suggest
that
this
is
not
an
area
which
is
appropriate
for
the
exercise
of
inherent
power.
traditionally,
as
i
understand
the
concept,
inherent
power
may
be
relied
upon
by
the
court,
which
has
a
particular
duty
imposed
on
it.
that
is,
if
a
court
has
been,
say,
required
by
a
statute
to
conduct
hearings
with
respect
to
certain
matters,
it
does
have
inherent
power
necessary
to
it
to
carry
out
its
jurisdictional
obligations,
and
if
a
procedure
has
not
been
provided
which
is
absolutely
necessary
to
the
exercise
of
its
power.
and,
through
inherent
power,
it
can
resolve
a
procedure
to
meet
the
problem,
but
discovery
just
doesn't
come
within
that.
civil
discovery
practice,
not
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination,
can
be
characterized
in
something
that's
necessary
to
a
habeas
court
to
carry
out
its
responsibilities
under
the
statute.
the
civil
discovery
mechanism
is
simply
foreign
to
the
habeas
practice.
i
think
it's
also
significant
in
this
regard
that
congress
has
never
seen
fact
to
extend
at
civil
discovery
practice
to
habeas
proceedings.
it
suggests
to
me
as
well
that
this
is
an
area
which
is
simply
inappropriate
for
an
exercise
of
inherent
power.
mr.
derald
e.
granberg
well,
wilson
versus
weigel
does
suggest
that
in
a
situation
in
which
it
would
be
appropriate
to
take
a
deposition
for
purposes
of
evidence,
that
that
deposition
can
be
taken
by
utilizing
written
interrogatories,
cross-interrogatories,
and
so
forth.
now,
that's
a
procedure
which
authorizes
sanctions,
if
you
would,
the
use
of
written
interrogatories,
but
as
a
technique
for
taking
an
evidentiary
deposition.
mr.
derald
e.
granberg
initially,
i'm
going
to
be
perfectly
clear
on
this
point,
that
court
would
have
no
power,
either
within
the
federal
civil
rules
or
apart
from
the
federal
civil
rules,
to
authorize
written
interrogatories
for
purposes
of
discovery
or
to
authorize
depositions
for
purposes
of
discovery.
mr.
derald
e.
granberg
if
on
a
--
mr.
derald
e.
granberg
let
me,
if
i
may,
poster
the
case
initially
before
i
answer
your
question.
now,
before
the
judge
--
district
judge
orders
an
evidentiary
hearing,
he
must
have
determined
that,
on
the
basis
of
the
petition
submitted
by
the
applicant
and
initially
the
traverse
submitted
by
the
applicant,
balancing
that
against
the
or
--
return
to
the
order
to
show
cause
submitted
by
the
respondent
warden,
that
there
are
certain
factual
questions
raised
that
there
have
been
factual
questions
raised
with
particularity
by
the
allegations
of
the
petitioner
that,
if
proven
to
be
true,
will
authorize
--
will,
in
effect,
compel
that
he'd
be
released
from
custody.
now,
the
petitioner
has
already
spelled
out
all
of
the
facts
that
he
needs
to
know
if
he
is
to
be
ordered
release
from
custody.
now,
i
don't
believe
that
the
discovery
serves
any
function
under
those
circumstances.
mr.
derald
e.
granberg
well,
i
would
answer,
no.
he
does
not
have
the
power
to
authorize
or
to
permit
the
use
of
discovery,
interrogatories,
or
discovery
depositions.
mr.
derald
e.
granberg
no,
but
the
procedure
already
exists.
it
exists
within
the
existing
framework
of
the
habeas
statute.
if
he
concludes
that
the
petitioner
has
stated
a
meritorious
claim,
he
orders
the
evidentiary
hearing
and
we
proceed
with
the
hearing.
mr.
derald
e.
granberg
he's
done
more
than
--
mr.
derald
e.
granberg
well,
affirmance
of
the
ninth
circuit
opinion
would
be
no
more
than
this.
it
would
be
a
recognition
that
there
is
no
power
existing
in
a
district
court,
either
under
the
federal
civil
rules
or
apart
from
them,
to
authorize
the
type
of
discovery
procedures
--
mr.
derald
e.
granberg
that
i
can
assume
ruled.
mr.
derald
e.
granberg
well,
before
the
judge
is
determinant,
an
evidentiary
hearing
is
appropriate.
he
is
determinant
there
is
more
than
a
prima
facie
case
stated.
he
is
determinant
there
are
more
than
conclusory
allegations
reflected
in
the
petition
and
in
its
reverse,
that
these
specific
facts
which
have
proven
would
authorize
--
mr.
derald
e.
granberg
release
from
custody
had
been
stated.
mr.
derald
e.
granberg
no,
i'm
not,
your
honor.
i'm
simply
trying
to
demonstrate
that
the
nature
of
the
habeas
proceeding
is
one
that
does
not
lend
itself
to
this
discovery
procedure,
nor
does
it
require
it
because
other
procedures
are
already
provided
which
afford
a
sufficient
basis
for
the
kind
of
factual
exploration
that's
necessary
in
a
habeas
proceeding.
mr.
derald
e.
granberg
oh,
yes.
mr.
derald
e.
granberg
certainly.
mr.
derald
e.
granberg
oh,
certainly,
to
ensure
truth,
your
honor,
and
i
would
submit
that
the
habeas
statute,
as
it
exist
now,
affords
all
of
the
procedures
necessary
to
accord
that
search
for
truth.
mr.
derald
e.
granberg
well,
the
question
you're
really
asking
--
mr.
derald
e.
granberg
it's
a
technique
which
is
utilized
to
ascertain
facts
to
clarify
issues.
it's
utilized
between
the
parties
and
conventional
civil
litigation,
but
i
would
submit
that
the
discovery
mechanism
of
the
federal
civil
rules
was
never
intended
by
the
framers
of
the
rules
to
be
applicable
to
a
habeas
proceeding
and
they
indicated
that
very
clearly,
with
the
exception
set
forth
in
section
81
(a)
(2).
mr.
derald
e.
granberg
the
question
you're
really
posing
is
this.
as
a
matter
of
policy,
should
we
have
some
sort
of
discovery
mechanism
in
a
habeas
proceeding?
and,
that
question
is
one
which
is
a
--
mr.
derald
e.
granberg
which,
is
appropriately
left
either
to
the
legislative
or
certainly
to
the
rule
making
process
--
mr.
derald
e.
granberg
that,
i
would
submit,
that
it's
not
a
matter
appropriate
for
a
federal
district
court
to
make
its
own
individual
determination
whether
or
not
a
particular
rule
should
be
applied
because
it
would
be
good
to
have
it
then.
mr.
derald
e.
granberg
that's
a
policy
determination
made
by
the
--
originally
by
the
framers
of
the
rule.
mr.
derald
e.
granberg
what
i'm
suggesting
is,
any
decision
that
this
court
makes
--
mr.
derald
e.
granberg
no,
i
don't.
but,
what
i
do
submit
is
that
the
procedure
existed
and
set
up
with
respect
to
habeas
corpus
affords
a
more
than
adequate
basis
to
make
the
nature
of
the
inquiry
called
for
by
the
statutes.
mr.
derald
e.
granberg
it
certainly
is.
mr.
derald
e.
granberg
it
certainly
is.
it's
completely
foreign
--
mr.
derald
e.
granberg
--
to
conventional
civil
litigation.
mr.
derald
e.
granberg
yes,
we
do.
mr.
derald
e.
granberg
i've
never
encountered
that
question.
mr.
derald
e.
granberg
i
believe
it's
probably
--
mr.
derald
e.
granberg
a
conventional
civil
action
is
initiated
by
the
file
of
a
complaint.
mr.
derald
e.
granberg
by
the
filing
of
a
complaint.
the
full
panoply
of
a
discovery
mechanism
in
civil
rules
then
becomes
available
to
the
individual
who
has
filed
that
complaint,
and
he
can
state
his
action
in
conformity
with
the
simplified
rules
of
the
federal
civil
rules
with
respect
to
pleading,
just
generally
indicated
the
nature
of
his
case,
then
he
proceeds
into
discovery.
a
habeas
petitioner
doesn't
start
his
case
that
way.
he
starts
his
case
by
submitting
a
petition
which
has
to
allege
with
particularity
to
the
specific
facts
upon
which
he's
going
to
rely.
and
he's
entitled
to
no
hearing
or
no
relief
from
the
court
unless
he
does
that
and
unless
he
poses
the
kind
of
factual
allegations
which
have
been
proven
would
entitle
him
to
relief.
mr.
derald
e.
granberg
it
might
very
well
help
them.
mr.
derald
e.
granberg
it
might
very
well
help
them
to
have
some
sort
of
discovery
mechanism
available,
but
the
question
before
this
court
now
is
whether
you're
going
to
allow
the
full
discovery
mechanism
of
a
federal
civil
rule
to
be
applied
in
a
habeas
proceeding,
and
i
would
submit
that
the
framers
of
the
rules
never
intended
that
and
that
the
very
nature
of
a
habeas
proceeding
is
not
appropriate
to
that
sort
of
discovery
mechanism.
mr.
derald
e.
granberg
certainly,
he
can.
that's
what
i'm
suggesting.
once
he
has
stated
a
basis
for
relief
and
the
court
has
ordered
an
evidentiary
hearing,
he
can
subpoena
witnesses.
he
could
call
in
anyone
to
substantiate
the
allegation
that
he
has
made
in
his
petition,
and
he
has
to
carry
the
burden
of
proving
this
and
he
can
do
it
under
the
existing
procedure.
thank
you.
mr.
derald
e.
granberg
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i'd
like
to
direct
my
remarks
initially
to
petitioner's
argument
that
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
authorize
the
use
of
the
discovery
mechanism
provided
therein
to
a
habeas
proceeding.
this,
of
course,
turns
on
the
construction
to
be
accorded
to
rule
81
(a)
(2)
of
those
rules
which
provides
simply,
these
rules
are
applicable
to
proceedings
for
admission
to
citizenship
habeas
corpus
and
quo
warranto,
to
the
extent
that
the
practice
in
such
proceedings
is
not
set
forth
in
statutes
of
the
united
states
and
is
here
to
conform
to
the
practice
in
civil
actions.
this
imposes
two
conditions,
and
we
will
argue
later
that
neither
these
conditions
can
be
met.
before
i
reach
that
argument,
however,
i
would
like
to
present
some
remarks
with
respect
to
what
i
feel
this
evidence
is
as
to
the
purpose
of
the
original
framers
of
these
rules
back
in
1938.
first
of
all,
i
believe
we
could
discern
that
it
makes
it
perfectly
apparent
that
the
framers
of
the
rules
recognized
that
procedures,
with
respect
to
habeas
corpus,
are
set
forth
in
the
statute.
secondly,
it
expresses
a
clear
intention
that
procedures,
with
respect
to
habeas
corpus,
are
to
be
controlled
by
statutory
changes
as
well.
it
is
any
of
that
that
a
statutory
change
occurs
with
respect
to
procedure.
that
is
to
control.
and,
finally,
with
respect
to
that
second
condition,
by
it
conforming
to
the
practice
prior
to
1938,
that
offense
is
a
clear
intention
not
to
change
existing
practice
in
habeas
corpus.
a
clear
intention
to
maintain
a
few
were
status
quo
with
respect
to
habeas
practice
as
it
existed
in
1938,
and
not
to
freeze
it
there
but
to
leave
any
changes
that
are
to
occur
to
congress
through
the
statutory
changes
that
it
sees
fit
to
make.
now,
certainly,
congress
has,
since
that
time,
affected
changes
with
respect
to
habeas
procedure.
the
--
this
recent
--
excuse
me.
the
most
recent
evidence
of
that
can
be
found
in
section
2241,
an
enactment
there
in
1966,
an
enactment
in
2254
in
1966,
enactments
which
significantly
affect
procedure
with
respect
to
habeas
proceedings.
i
believe
that
this
--
mr.
derald
e.
granberg
2241
relates
essentially
to
jurisdiction
and
provides
that
when
you
have
a
state
with
more
than
one
federal
judicial
district,
a
habeas
petition
can
be
entertained
either
in
a
district
within
which
the
petitioner
is
confined
or
the
district
within
which
a
state
criminal
conviction
and
sentence
occurred.
now,
2254
provides
significant
changes
with
respect
to
the
presumption
of
correctness
which
is
to
attend
a
state
factual
determination
reached
after
a
hearing
and
reflected
by
written
indicia
or
findings.
mr.
derald
e.
granberg
1966,
yes,
your
honor.
now,
i
believe
that
this
policy
decision
reflected
in
rule
81
(a)
(2),
as
of
1938,
is
a
very
sound
one,
but
it
was
sound
when
made
and
it
remains
sound
today.
first
of
all,
pleading
in
procedure
in
habeas
corpus
is
completely
inconsistent
with
pleading
procedure
as
it
exists
now
under
the
conventional
rules
of
practice
for
a
civil
litigation.
and,
a
habeas
petitioner
is
required
to
allege
with
particularity,
those
facts
upon
which
he
relies,
and
which
if
established,
would
justify
him
to
relate.
when
congress
introduced
the
discovery
procedure
through
the
civil
rules
in
1938,
it
affronted
what
this
court
referred
to
as
one
of
the
most
significant
innovations
of
those
rules
yet.
those
rules
came
in
along
with
substantial
changes
with
respect
to
pleading
in
civil
actions
as
well
as
simplified
pleading.
and,
part
of
a
justification
for
the
change
in
pleading
exists
in
the
fact
that
the
discovery
techniques
are
afforded
to
the
parties
to
be
exercised
by
the
parties
for
the
purposes
of
defining
issues,
for
fact
revelation,
and
such
similar
purposes.
now,
the
justification
with
this
discovery
procedure
lies
certainly
in
part
in
these
pleading
changes
which
occurred
as
well,
simplified
pleadings,
streamlined
pleading.
yet,
these
pleading
changes
have
no
pertinence
whatever
with
respect
to
a
habeas
proceeding.
now,
i
believe
a
second
sound
reason
why
the
framers
sought
that
not
to
extent
these
civil
rules
with
respect
to
the
discovery
mechanism
to
a
habeas
proceeding
is
this.
it's
completely
inconsistent
with
the
summary
nature
of
a
habeas
proceeding.
now,
when
i
say
summary,
certainly,
i'm
talking
in
terms
of
affording
quick
relief
to
a
petitioner.
i'm
talking
about
other
reasons
as
well.
such
factors
as
minimizing
the
impact
on
a
state
rehabilitated
process,
such
factors
as
minimizing
the
impact
of
the
burden
of
habeas
applications
upon
the
federal
courts
as
well.
there
are
techniques
for
resolving
these
petitions
for
disposing
of
them
without
proceeding
through
a
hearing.
certainly,
if
petitioner
has
failed
to
allege
these
specific
facts
as
inserted
only
conclusory
allegations
in
stating
his
claim
for
relief,
he's
not
entitled
to
a
hearing.
the
petition
is
entitled
to
be
dismissed.
another
sound
policy
consideration,
i
think,
that
existed
in
1938
and,
certainly,
that
continues
today
is
the
fact
that
in
no
criminal
discovery
system
that
has
been
initiated
within
any
state
or
within
the
federal
system
does
anything
akin
to
this
civil
discovery
mechanism
exist,
nothing
that
even
approximates.
now
certainly,
california,
in
the
field
of
criminal
discovery,
has
gone
as
far
as
anyone
has,
perhaps
much
further.
now,
we
afford
to
a
defendant
copies
of
any
statements
he's
made,
copies
of
other
witnesses,
copies
relating
to
physical
tests,
copies
relating
to
examination
of
scientific
evidence.
factors
such
as
these,
for
a
long
time,
we've
given
them
copies
of
the
grand
jury
transcript
that
has
been
indicted.
he's
afforded
a
copy
of
the
transcript
of
the
preliminary
hearing
if
he's
held
to
answer
through
the
information
process.
yet,
california
has
specifically
rejected
efforts
to
utilize
depositions
for
purposes
of
discovery
or
interrogatories
for
purposes
of
discovery.
it's
a
system
which
is
simply
foreign
to
the
procedure
and
its'
been
recognized
as
such
and
rejected.
and,
i
submit
that
it
is
just
as
foreign
within
the
context
of
a
habeas
proceeding.
mr.
derald
e.
granberg
yes,
your
honor.
usually,
it's
done
informally.
frequently,
it's
done
pursuant
to
order
of
the
court,
but
it
is
accepted
practice.
mr.
derald
e.
granberg
no,
your
honor.
mr.
derald
e.
granberg
discovery
in
criminal
practice
in
california
is
not
a
creature
of
statute.
it's
a
creature
of
judicial
decision.
mr.
derald
e.
granberg
it
is
not
recognized
by
a
statute,
but
the
court
appropriately
recognized
that
the
provisions,
with
respect
to
civil
discovery,
have
no
applicability
to
criminal
cases.
finally,
i
believe
that
this
policy
decision
made
back
in
1938
was
found
and
remain
sound
for
further
reason.
when
you
balance
the
potential
for
abuse
which
exists
here
against
the
value
--
potential
value
of
the
procedure
to
petitioners,
i
think
it
becomes
perfectly
apparent
that
the
increase
in
litigation
increased
burden
on
states
attorneys.
the
dangers
of
harassment
with
respect
to
witnesses,
arresting
officers,
prosecuting
attorneys,
perhaps
even
defense
attorneys,
should
the
procedure
be
made
available,
indicates
a
sound
reason
for
not
extending
civil
discovery
to
habeas
proceedings.
i'd
like
to
turn
now
for
a
moment
to
the
specific
condition
set
forth
in
section
81
(a)
(2),
and
i
will
argue
that
the
first
condition
cannot
be
met,
that
is,
there
cannot
be
a
showing
that
practice
is
not
controlled
by
a
statute.
practice
was
respect
to
depositions
and
interrogatory
is
controlled
by
a
statute
within
the
habeas
act.
section
2246
accomplishes
this.
depositions
may
be
utilized
for
evidence.
judicially,
in
the
ninth
circuit,
and
i
refer
now
to
the
wilson
versus
weigel,
the
court
has
indicated
that
depositions,
as
the
term
is
used
in
2246,
includes
also
depositions
on
written
interrogatories.
now,
that's
not
an
acceptance
of
the
applicability
of
the
civil
rules.
it's
simply
a
recognition
that
one
appropriate
way
of
taking
a
deposition
is
by
written
interrogatories.
of
course,
this
follows
a
procedure
very
much
akin
to
that
set
out
in
section
31
of
the
federal
civil
rules.
but,
in
any
event,
2246
limits
depositions
to
evidentiary
purposes.
in
wilson
versus
weigel,
the
ninth
circuit
was
asked
to
extend
or
to
reconsider
the
decision
that
is
now
here
before
this
court
in
wilson
versus
harris
and
change
its
mind,
but
it
did
not.
it
said
depositions
can
be
taken
under
section
2246
and
that
it
cannot
be
taken
under
rule
26
(a)
of
the
federal
civil
rules
for
purposes
of
discovery.
and,
if
objections
are
to
be
made
to
specific
questions,
then
this
is
the
appropriate
matter
--
appropriate
approach
to
take
but,
nevertheless,
it
refused
to
extend
the
federal
civil
rules
to
a
habeas
proceeding.
it
adhered
to
the
decision
that
it
entered
earlier
in
this
case
here
in
issue.
now,
i
think
it's
extremely
significant
the
manner
in
which
section
2246
regulates
deposition
in
interrogatory
practice
and
the
fact
that
this
was
enacted.
2246
was
added
in
1948,
a
full
10
years
after
the
federal
civil
rules
have
been
adopted.
yet,
not
only
do
we
have
the
inconsistency
between
rule
26
through
37
of
the
federal
civil
rules
that
added
2246
of
the
habeas
act
that
depositions,
interrogatories,
and
so
forth
are
not
permitted
for
discovery
in
habeas
actions,
but
we
also
have
inconsistencies
with
respect
to
the
use
which
may
be
made
of
depositions
taken
or
interrogatories,
if
you
will,
for
purposes
of
evidence
at
a
trial.
under
2246,
the
section
provides
simply
that
depositions
may
be
taken
for
use
as
evidence,
may
be
utilized
in
taking
evidence
at
a
habeas
proceeding.
rule
26
(a),
on
the
other
hand,
provides
a
number
of
conditions
with
respect
to
the
utilization
which
can
be
made
at
trial
of
depositions
taken
pursuant
to
them.
again,
when
congress
added
2246
in
1948,
i
submit,
it
specifically
rejected
any
suggestion
that
discovery
techniques
such
those
found
in
the
civil
rules
should
be
applicable
in
a
habeas
proceeding.
mr.
derald
e.
granberg
the
legislative
history
which
we
encountered
with
respect
to
2246
deals
solely
with
the
techniques
of
taking
evidence.
there's
no
discussion
that
we
have
been
able
to
find
with
respect
to
discovery.
it
does
make
the
point
that
the
use
of
written
interrogatories
under
2246,
as
it
appears
there,
is
limited
to
what
--
to
offering
something
in
akin
to
cross-examination
of
one
who
has
presented
an
affidavit.
that
is,
under
the
section
literally,
written
interrogatories
can
be
used
only
against
an
individual
who
has
presented
an
affidavit
for
use
in
evidence,
technique
of
testing
the
evidence
in
that
way.
finally,
turning
to
the
second
condition
with
respect
to
former
practice,
there
simply
can't
be
no
showing
made
that
anything,
even
a
perch,
the
discovery
mechanism
found
in
the
federal
rules
in
civil
procedure
existed
in
the
habeas
proceedings
in
1938.
i
would
submit
that
there
can
be
no
showing
that
any
discovery
practice
existed
in
habeas
court
in
1938.
the
purpose
expressed
in
maintaining
status
quo
certainly
militates
against
any
finding
that
the
second
condition
can
be
met.
mr.
derald
e.
granberg
yes?
mr.
derald
e.
granberg
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
derald
e.
granberg
in
1948.
mr.
derald
e.
granberg
your
honor,
that
should
be
found
starting
at
about
page
19.
mr.
derald
e.
granberg
now,
i
would
submit
that
this
absence
of
authority
to
make
any
showing
prior
discovery
practice
in
habeas
proceedings,
prior
to
1948
that
is,
is
extremely
significant.
certainly,
this
absence
of
authority
was
viewed
as
one
of
the
factors
which
lead
this
court
to
conclude
in
miner
versus
atlass
that
there
was
no
traditional
inherent
power
if
you
were
to
order
depositions
or
to
authorize
deposition
for
discovery
purposes
in
an
admiralty
proceeding.
now,
as
the
court
noted
specifically
that
there
was
no
indication,
the
traditional
practice
in
this
regard.
turning
to
the
argument
that,
apart
from
the
civil
rules,
the
court
have
some
sort
of
inherent
power
to
authorize
and
implement
and
sanction
or
fashion,
if
you
were,
a
discovery
procedure
akin
to
that
found
in
the
civil
rules,
i
submit
that
this
is
simply
not
an
appropriate
area
for
an
exercise
of
inherent
power.
one
of
the
justifications
that
had
been
offered
to
this
court
by
a
petitioner
is
that
such
a
power
can
be
found
within
the
habeas
statutes
themselves.
the
hearing
requirement
impose
by
section
2243
is
summarily
here
and
resolved.
i
submit
that
that
affords
no
basis
for
implementing
or
for
permitting
district
courts
to
implement,
if
you
were,
discovery
practice
in
akin
to
this.
now,
certainly,
2246
within
the
habeas
statutes
affords
no
basis
for
implementing
a
discovery
practice
into
this.
the
time
provisions
filed
within
2243,
the
time
requirements,
are
completely
at
odds
with
implanting
a
discovery
procedure
akin
to
that
found
in
the
federal
civil
rules.
as
we've
argued
earlier,
the
plating
requirements
with
respect
to
habeas
are
completely
inconsistent
with
implementing
a
discovery
procedure.
an
applicant's
required
to
plead
and
assert,
with
particularity,
those
factual
matters
upon
which
he
would
rely
on
seeking
relief.
and,
it's
also
significant
to
note
that
the
habeas
statutes
do
deal
with
the
production
of
records,
documents,
and
that
this
offers
one
additional
reason
for
finding
a
real
necessity
for
civil
discovery
techniques
in
a
habeas
proceeding.
one
of
the
requirements
with
respect
to
a
habeas
applicant
in
the
federal
courts
is
that
he
had
exhausted
state
remedies
before
he
reaches
the
federal
courts
or
before
the
federal
courts,
at
least
as
a
matter
of
committee,
assume
jurisdiction.
224
--
2254
of
the
habeas
statutes
now
provides,
when
a
factual
determination
has
been
made
by
a
state
court
and
it's
been
made
after
a
hearing
on
the
merits,
it's
entitled
to
a
presumption
of
correctives.
and,
if
an
issue
passes
through
the
state
courts
and
reaches
the
federal
courts
and
those
records
become
significant,
2254
also
provides
a
means
whereby
those
records
--
court
records
and
materials
relating
to
the
factual
determination
can
be
brought
before
the
federal
court
and
be
relied
upon
in
resolving
the
petition.
insofar
as
any
suggestion
that
an
inherent
power
may
be
found
apart
from
the
habeas
statutes,
just
kind
of
a
vague
general
inherent
power,
i
would
suggest
that
this
is
not
an
area
which
is
appropriate
for
the
exercise
of
inherent
power.
traditionally,
as
i
understand
the
concept,
inherent
power
may
be
relied
upon
by
the
court,
which
has
a
particular
duty
imposed
on
it.
that
is,
if
a
court
has
been,
say,
required
by
a
statute
to
conduct
hearings
with
respect
to
certain
matters,
it
does
have
inherent
power
necessary
to
it
to
carry
out
its
jurisdictional
obligations,
and
if
a
procedure
has
not
been
provided
which
is
absolutely
necessary
to
the
exercise
of
its
power.
and,
through
inherent
power,
it
can
resolve
a
procedure
to
meet
the
problem,
but
discovery
just
doesn't
come
within
that.
civil
discovery
practice,
not
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination,
can
be
characterized
in
something
that's
necessary
to
a
habeas
court
to
carry
out
its
responsibilities
under
the
statute.
the
civil
discovery
mechanism
is
simply
foreign
to
the
habeas
practice.
i
think
it's
also
significant
in
this
regard
that
congress
has
never
seen
fact
to
extend
at
civil
discovery
practice
to
habeas
proceedings.
it
suggests
to
me
as
well
that
this
is
an
area
which
is
simply
inappropriate
for
an
exercise
of
inherent
power.
mr.
derald
e.
granberg
well,
wilson
versus
weigel
does
suggest
that
in
a
situation
in
which
it
would
be
appropriate
to
take
a
deposition
for
purposes
of
evidence,
that
that
deposition
can
be
taken
by
utilizing
written
interrogatories,
cross-interrogatories,
and
so
forth.
now,
that's
a
procedure
which
authorizes
sanctions,
if
you
would,
the
use
of
written
interrogatories,
but
as
a
technique
for
taking
an
evidentiary
deposition.
mr.
derald
e.
granberg
initially,
i'm
going
to
be
perfectly
clear
on
this
point,
that
court
would
have
no
power,
either
within
the
federal
civil
rules
or
apart
from
the
federal
civil
rules,
to
authorize
written
interrogatories
for
purposes
of
discovery
or
to
authorize
depositions
for
purposes
of
discovery.
mr.
derald
e.
granberg
if
on
a
--
mr.
derald
e.
granberg
let
me,
if
i
may,
poster
the
case
initially
before
i
answer
your
question.
now,
before
the
judge
--
district
judge
orders
an
evidentiary
hearing,
he
must
have
determined
that,
on
the
basis
of
the
petition
submitted
by
the
applicant
and
initially
the
traverse
submitted
by
the
applicant,
balancing
that
against
the
or
--
return
to
the
order
to
show
cause
submitted
by
the
respondent
warden,
that
there
are
certain
factual
questions
raised
that
there
have
been
factual
questions
raised
with
particularity
by
the
allegations
of
the
petitioner
that,
if
proven
to
be
true,
will
authorize
--
will,
in
effect,
compel
that
he'd
be
released
from
custody.
now,
the
petitioner
has
already
spelled
out
all
of
the
facts
that
he
needs
to
know
if
he
is
to
be
ordered
release
from
custody.
now,
i
don't
believe
that
the
discovery
serves
any
function
under
those
circumstances.
mr.
derald
e.
granberg
well,
i
would
answer,
no.
he
does
not
have
the
power
to
authorize
or
to
permit
the
use
of
discovery,
interrogatories,
or
discovery
depositions.
mr.
derald
e.
granberg
no,
but
the
procedure
already
exists.
it
exists
within
the
existing
framework
of
the
habeas
statute.
if
he
concludes
that
the
petitioner
has
stated
a
meritorious
claim,
he
orders
the
evidentiary
hearing
and
we
proceed
with
the
hearing.
mr.
derald
e.
granberg
he's
done
more
than
--
mr.
derald
e.
granberg
well,
affirmance
of
the
ninth
circuit
opinion
would
be
no
more
than
this.
it
would
be
a
recognition
that
there
is
no
power
existing
in
a
district
court,
either
under
the
federal
civil
rules
or
apart
from
them,
to
authorize
the
type
of
discovery
procedures
--
mr.
derald
e.
granberg
that
i
can
assume
ruled.
mr.
derald
e.
granberg
well,
before
the
judge
is
determinant,
an
evidentiary
hearing
is
appropriate.
he
is
determinant
there
is
more
than
a
prima
facie
case
stated.
he
is
determinant
there
are
more
than
conclusory
allegations
reflected
in
the
petition
and
in
its
reverse,
that
these
specific
facts
which
have
proven
would
authorize
--
mr.
derald
e.
granberg
release
from
custody
had
been
stated.
mr.
derald
e.
granberg
no,
i'm
not,
your
honor.
i'm
simply
trying
to
demonstrate
that
the
nature
of
the
habeas
proceeding
is
one
that
does
not
lend
itself
to
this
discovery
procedure,
nor
does
it
require
it
because
other
procedures
are
already
provided
which
afford
a
sufficient
basis
for
the
kind
of
factual
exploration
that's
necessary
in
a
habeas
proceeding.
mr.
derald
e.
granberg
oh,
yes.
mr.
derald
e.
granberg
certainly.
mr.
derald
e.
granberg
oh,
certainly,
to
ensure
truth,
your
honor,
and
i
would
submit
that
the
habeas
statute,
as
it
exist
now,
affords
all
of
the
procedures
necessary
to
accord
that
search
for
truth.
mr.
derald
e.
granberg
well,
the
question
you're
really
asking
--
mr.
derald
e.
granberg
it's
a
technique
which
is
utilized
to
ascertain
facts
to
clarify
issues.
it's
utilized
between
the
parties
and
conventional
civil
litigation,
but
i
would
submit
that
the
discovery
mechanism
of
the
federal
civil
rules
was
never
intended
by
the
framers
of
the
rules
to
be
applicable
to
a
habeas
proceeding
and
they
indicated
that
very
clearly,
with
the
exception
set
forth
in
section
81
(a)
(2).
mr.
derald
e.
granberg
the
question
you're
really
posing
is
this.
as
a
matter
of
policy,
should
we
have
some
sort
of
discovery
mechanism
in
a
habeas
proceeding?
and,
that
question
is
one
which
is
a
--
mr.
derald
e.
granberg
which,
is
appropriately
left
either
to
the
legislative
or
certainly
to
the
rule
making
process
--
mr.
derald
e.
granberg
that,
i
would
submit,
that
it's
not
a
matter
appropriate
for
a
federal
district
court
to
make
its
own
individual
determination
whether
or
not
a
particular
rule
should
be
applied
because
it
would
be
good
to
have
it
then.
mr.
derald
e.
granberg
that's
a
policy
determination
made
by
the
--
originally
by
the
framers
of
the
rule.
mr.
derald
e.
granberg
what
i'm
suggesting
is,
any
decision
that
this
court
makes
--
mr.
derald
e.
granberg
no,
i
don't.
but,
what
i
do
submit
is
that
the
procedure
existed
and
set
up
with
respect
to
habeas
corpus
affords
a
more
than
adequate
basis
to
make
the
nature
of
the
inquiry
called
for
by
the
statutes.
mr.
derald
e.
granberg
it
certainly
is.
mr.
derald
e.
granberg
it
certainly
is.
it's
completely
foreign
--
mr.
derald
e.
granberg
--
to
conventional
civil
litigation.
mr.
derald
e.
granberg
yes,
we
do.
mr.
derald
e.
granberg
i've
never
encountered
that
question.
mr.
derald
e.
granberg
i
believe
it's
probably
--
mr.
derald
e.
granberg
a
conventional
civil
action
is
initiated
by
the
file
of
a
complaint.
mr.
derald
e.
granberg
by
the
filing
of
a
complaint.
the
full
panoply
of
a
discovery
mechanism
in
civil
rules
then
becomes
available
to
the
individual
who
has
filed
that
complaint,
and
he
can
state
his
action
in
conformity
with
the
simplified
rules
of
the
federal
civil
rules
with
respect
to
pleading,
just
generally
indicated
the
nature
of
his
case,
then
he
proceeds
into
discovery.
a
habeas
petitioner
doesn't
start
his
case
that
way.
he
starts
his
case
by
submitting
a
petition
which
has
to
allege
with
particularity
to
the
specific
facts
upon
which
he's
going
to
rely.
and
he's
entitled
to
no
hearing
or
no
relief
from
the
court
unless
he
does
that
and
unless
he
poses
the
kind
of
factual
allegations
which
have
been
proven
would
entitle
him
to
relief.
mr.
derald
e.
granberg
it
might
very
well
help
them.
mr.
derald
e.
granberg
it
might
very
well
help
them
to
have
some
sort
of
discovery
mechanism
available,
but
the
question
before
this
court
now
is
whether
you're
going
to
allow
the
full
discovery
mechanism
of
a
federal
civil
rule
to
be
applied
in
a
habeas
proceeding,
and
i
would
submit
that
the
framers
of
the
rules
never
intended
that
and
that
the
very
nature
of
a
habeas
proceeding
is
not
appropriate
to
that
sort
of
discovery
mechanism.
mr.
derald
e.
granberg
certainly,
he
can.
that's
what
i'm
suggesting.
once
he
has
stated
a
basis
for
relief
and
the
court
has
ordered
an
evidentiary
hearing,
he
can
subpoena
witnesses.
he
could
call
in
anyone
to
substantiate
the
allegation
that
he
has
made
in
his
petition,
and
he
has
to
carry
the
burden
of
proving
this
and
he
can
do
it
under
the
existing
procedure.
thank
you.
