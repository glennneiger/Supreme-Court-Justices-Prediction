justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
mean
--
you
mean,
full
sweep
of
the
discovery
rules?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
a
full
sweep
of
the
rule
as
ordinarily
applicable
to
a
civil
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
can
you
illustrate
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
that
--
that's
not
an
unfamiliar
argument,
anyway,
in
a
matter
of
discovery
generally,
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather
you
might
be
opposed
to
this
argument.
i
understand
it
to
be
a
concession
that
in
the
habeas
corpus
process
itself,
you
suggest,
imposes
the
restraints
that
you
just
mentioned.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
on
the
application
of
the
discovery
rule
and
the
civil
rule.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there
aren't
any
comparable
restraints
to
the
ordinary
civil
cases,
i
suppose.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that
in
the
ordinary
civil
case,
one
files
a
complaint
and
i
decide
that
this
goes
bad
without
court
order.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
proceeds
to
discovery.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
complaints
within
the
federal
habeas
statute
has
imposed
these
special
restraint,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
just
as
a
matter
of
interest,
do
you
now
give
them
a
list
of
witnesses?
does
a
state
give
the
defendant
a
list
of
witnesses?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
isn't
done
automatically?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
isn't
done
automatically
in
every
case.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
granberg.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
your
brief
have
any
legislative
history
of
2246?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
said
that
you
just
put
it
in
1948,
didn't
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
can
you
refer
me
--
quickly,
don't
expend
your
time
now
with
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
thank
you
very
much.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
let's
see,
i
gather
2255
refers,
at
least
speaks,
of
the
case,
doesn't
it?
of
the
case
to
which
the
petitioner
is
addressing.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
petition
--
what's
the
case?
its'
the
criminal
part
case,
isn't
it?
on
the
--
facially,
apart
from
hickman
and
the
others,
i
take
it
on
the
face
of
2255
it's
only
another
step
in
the
criminal
clause.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
isn't
it?
i
mean,
on
the
face
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
on
the
face
of
2255,
it's
just
another
step
in
the
criminal
clause
itself,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you
don't
argue
that
in
your
brief,
do
you?
any
reason
why
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
my.
but,
whatever
it
may
have
been,
certainly,
you
can't
read
it
from
the
first
word
to
the
last
without
recognizing
it
as
a
little
different
from
a
state
--
problem
of
the
state
prisoner.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
just
--
i'm
just
surprised.
i
should
think
that's
a
rather
strong
argument
in
favor
of
the
government,
at
least
where
your
interest
primarily
lies,
which
is
in
2255
proceedings.
i
gather
you
have
very
few
actual
habeas
corpus.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
of
2255.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
this
would
be
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
--
you
mean
that
there
is
such
a
power
in
addition
to
whatever
it
may
be
the
scope
of
2246?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i
--
but,
doesn't
the
government
also
argue
that,
in
any
event,
the
extent
of
any
power
in
the
premises
is
that
which
is
granted
by
2246?
does
the
government
argue
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
--
what
any
bearing
of
2246
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
all
on
2255?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
let's
take
just
a
state
prisoner
then
where
we're
dealing
only
with
2246.
you
say,
as
to
the
state
prisoner
too,
there
is
a
power
and
a
habeas
court
in
addition
to
any
power
that's
under
2246?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that's
the
inherent
power,
so-called?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
in
any
event,
whatever
it
is
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
doesn't
have
a
statutory
source.
it's
something
in
addition.
you
don't
suppose
it
could
be
argued
here
that,
speaking
now
only
for
the
moment
of
the
state
prisoner,
that
congress
has
set
the
limits
in
2246
and,
having
set
the
limits,
there's
no
room
for
additional
power
in
the
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you
don't'
argue
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
state
has,
but
the
federal
government
doesn't(voice
overlap).
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
i
think
the
federal
government
has
a
very
big
stake
in
this.
after
all
these
federal
habeas
proceedings
of
state
prisoners,
as
you
pointed
out,
are
in
thousands
a
year
now,
and
that's
a
burden
on
the
federal
district
judges,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and,
yet,
you
don't
share
with
california
the
view
that
2246
is
the
limit
of
any
power
in
the
premises.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
beyond
anything
that's
authorized
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
by
2246.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
what
i
thought
you
say,
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
really
surprised
at
that,
mr.
feit.
i
would
think,
really,
that
the
government
sent
this
as
greater,
greater
in
the
procedures
that
govern
state
prisoner
applications
in
federal
courts.
certainly,
in
terms
of
the
burden
of
collateral
proceedings
on
federal
district
courts,
it's
much
larger
than
the
area
of
the
state
prisoner
than
this
--
of
the
federal
prisoner
under
2255.
you
told
us
that
in
the
outset.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
mean
--
you
mean,
full
sweep
of
the
discovery
rules?
justice
william
j.

a
