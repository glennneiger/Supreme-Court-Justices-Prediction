how
much
discovery
do
you
--
in
the
habeas
that
is
available
to
a
state?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
think
your
supreme
court
allows
some
discovery
in
some
cases,
that
is,
must
keep
itself
on
the
part
of
the
state,
notwithstanding
the
privilege?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
your
state
allow
an
accused
discovering
the
names
of
witnesses
that
state
may
use
against?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
why
you
don't
argue
that
whatever
may
be
true
of
federal
habeas
as
a
remedy
for
the
state
prisoner,
clearly
enough
for
the
federal
prisoner,
you're
just
dealing
with
another
step
on
the
criminal
clause
itself.
so,
you
can't
have
a
civil
proceeding.
justice
byron

incidentally,
that's
between
the
habeas
applications
of
state
prisoners
in
the
2255
applications
of
federal
prisoners,
what's
the
current
statistical
data?
which
is
the
greater
numbered
now?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
i
see.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
that's
only
2255.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
had
comparable
statistics
for
the
state
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
take
it,
the
number
of
filings,
let
me
put
it
that
way,
of
state
prisoners
for
federal
habeas
relief
must
be
many
times
the
number
of
filings
of
federal
prisoners.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
2255
doesn't
have
to
prescribe
any
procedures
to
the
extent
that
is
prescribed
for
a
state
habeas,
and
there's
cross-reference
to
the
habeas
corpus
procedure
for
some
purposes,
but
not
for
others.
there
is
no
cross-reference
that
no
general
statement
that
the
procedure
on
2255
shall
be
as
prescribed
for
habeas
corpus
petitions.
and,
i
would
assume
that
there
may
be
some
room
for
arguing
that
there's
some
flexibility
in
the
2255
procedure
which
is
not
present
in
the
state
habeas.
justice
byron
r.
white
certainly,
the
limitations
on
a
federal
court
to
grant
state
habeas
that
are
contained
in
the
proc
--
in
the
statutes
with
respect
to
habeas
corpus
petitions
are
not
applicable
at
all.
