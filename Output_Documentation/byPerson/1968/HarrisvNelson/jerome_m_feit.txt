mr.
jerome
m.
feit
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
government's
interest
--
the
federal
government's
in
this
case
is
substantial
since
we're
concerned
that
any
ruling
as
to
the
automatic
applicability
of
the
civil
rules
of
discovery
in
habeas
would,
as
a
matter
of
course,
it
seems
to
us,
require
the
conclusion
that
they
apply
equally
to
proceedings
under
2255
a
statutory
counterpart
in
habeas
corpus.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
yes.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
well
--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
20
--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
well,
it
is
on
the
face
of
2255
are
the
steps
in
the
criminal
clause
itself.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
well,
what
we
think
2255
essentially
is
basically,
as
this
court
has
suggested
in
hickman
--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
this
is
quite
true
but,
of
course,
the
last
3part
of
2255
does
suggest
that
--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
habeas
corpus
cases,
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
well,
principally,
because
we
were
concerned
of
the
problem
of
suggesting
that
a
state
applicant
might
get
discovery
with,
as
mine
or
an
appellee
points
out,
this
is
a
substantial
rather
than
a
procedural
rule
to
say
that
a
ha--a
2255
applicant
is
an
entirely
different
situation.
i
agree
with
you,
your
honor,
that
the
specifics
of
2255
--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
i
believe
the
state
is
still
the
greater
numbered.
we've
set
it
out
at
page
12
of
our
brief.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
i
have
found
some
additional
figures
for
the
court
with
respect
to
2255
applications.
in
19
--
fiscal
1967,
the
administrative
office
of
the
courts
advices
me
that
932
2255
applications
were
disposed
of.
it's
not
clear
when
they
were
instituted.
about
90%
or
a
little
more
than
842
of
those
were
disposed
pre-trial,
6
were
terminate
after
a
pre-trial
conference,
and
19
was
--
were
withdrawn,
65
were
given
hearings.
now,
i
was
unable
to
get
specific
details
of
when
--
of
the
percentage
of
actual
denials
and
grants,
what
happened
at
the
hearing.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
2255,
yes.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
i
wasn't
able
to
get
comparable
statistics
as
to
the
state
material
nor
was
i
able
to
get
an
actual
breakdown.
i
gather
this
had
been
done
at
the
time
of
brown
and
allen.
mr.
justice
frankfurter
had
asked
the
administrative
office
of
the
courts
to
do
this
in
the
summer
during
that
prior
argument
to
that
case,
but
--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
i
would
--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
all
the
--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
yes.
i
think
this
is
quite
clear.
even
the
figures
in
our
brief
on
page
12
point
this
out.
i
would
like
also
to
note
that,
initially,
that
government's
view
is
not
that
the
sentencing
judge
on
the
2255
is
without
power
wholly
apart
from
the
federal
civil
rules
to
permit
discovery
fact-finding
in
the
rare
and
unusual
case.
essentially,
our
position
is
that
the
civil
rules
of
discovery
deposition
do
not
apply
the
2255
prosi
--
proceedings.
one
looks
at
the
statute,
as
mr.
justice
brennan
points
out,
the
claimant
has
the
obligation
to
set
forth
the
facts
that
was
raised
in
issue
and,
most
significantly,
the
sentencing
court
is
then
to
examine
the
motion
of
files
and
records
of
the
case
to
see
if
these
documents
conclusively
show
that
the
prisoner
is
not
entitled
to
any
relief.
if
he
so
concludes,
he
shall
dismiss
or
deny
the
application.
if
he
does
not,
he
can
notify
the
us
attorney
and
schedule
a
hearing
to
determine
the
issues
and
make
findings
of
fact
and
conclusions
of
law.
moreover,
whenever
a
hearing
is
to
be
held,
it
is
required
to
be
held
promptly.
it
is
at
such
a
hearing
that
the
issues
will
be
explored
and
it
is
based
upon
the
facts
induced
on
such
hearing
that
the
sentencing
judge
is
to
make
his
findings
of
fact
and
conclusions
of
law.
what
congress
has
done
perhaps
extend
to
the
practice
in
a
criminal
case
but,
in
effect
on
the
2255,
it
has
set
up
a
pleading
method
of
evaluating
the
claim
and
perhaps
this
is
the
same
way
of
saying,
mr.
justice
brennan,
which
takes
account
quite
clearly
of
the
fact
that
the
sentencing
judge
is
now
operating
on
a
clean
slate,
but
against
the
background
of
a
criminal
conviction
which
might
have
fully
resolved
the
issue
so
that
it
would
be
re-litigated
in
2255.
and
finally,
it
has
recognized
that,
at
the
hearing,
the
sentencing
judge
and
no
one
else
has
the
obligation
to
determine
if
the
restraint
alleged
is
unconstitutional.
on
the
other
hand,
the
crucial
thrust
of
the
deposition
interrogatory
practice
under
the
civil
rules
is
just
the
other
way.
in
a
large
measure,
its
purpose
is
to
supplant
the
pleading
in
trial
development
of
fact
that
is
the
basic--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
well,
we're
in
issue
--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
i
think
--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
i
think
the
statute,
though,
puts
the
primary
focus
on
the
examination
of
the
files
and
records.
if
they
conclusively
show
that
the
prisoner
is
entitled
to
no
relief,
the
judge
must
dismiss
the
motion.
now,
if
that
is
inappropriate
then,
normally,
he
would
hold
a
hearing
and
presumably
would
appoint
counsel.
we
--
we
don't
think
that
2255
is
simply
an
extension
of
the
criminal
case
per
se.
what
we
think
it
is,
is
a
particularized
method
by
which
congress
sought
to
attack
--
permit
attack
collaterally
upon
convictions
because
2255
still
provides
that
if
the
relief
is
insufficient
or
unavailable
or
that
the
habeas
corpus
might
provide
it
a
proper
remedy.
now,
this
court
has
pointed
out
on
more
than
one
occasion
that
the
relief
under
2255
is
the
substantial
equivalent
of
the
relief
under
habeas
corpus.
i
think
it
might
be
a
serious
problem
to
consider
2255
simply
of
an
extension
of
the
criminal
case.
then,
i
presume
it
could
be
argued
that
relief
under
the
habeas
statutes
would
still
be
available.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
no,
i
agree.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
i
agree.
i
think
that
2255
is
a
particularized
method
set
up
by
congress
to
deal
with
post
conviction
alleged
constitutional
defects.
in
civil
discovery,
the
vital
developments
of
the
fact
is
to
stem
from
the
pre-trial
examination
and,
primarily,
to
afford
a
way
out,
perhaps,
for
out-of-court
settlement
either
by
agreement
of
the
parties
with
summary
judgment.
alternatively,
if
the
case
needs
to
go
to
trial,
discovery
provides
a
way
to
assure
that
no
relevant
facts
in
either
party's
case
are
hidden
at
the
trial.
in
ordinary
civil
litigation,
wholly
unrelated
to
a
pre-existing
criminal
conviction,
the
benefits,
thus
arrived,
are
deemed
to
outweigh
the
time
expended
in
such
deposition
and
cross-deposition
practice,
but
such
practice
is
wholly
at
odds,
as
i
say,
with
the
scheme
and
definite
precision
of
section
2255,
and
it
raises
the
danger
of
logging
upon
time-consuming
possibly
irrelevant
investigation
better
spent
at
a
hearing.
but,
perhaps
most
significantly
from
our
point
of
view,
the
automatic
adoption
of
the
deposition
interrogatory
rules
of
civil
discovery
in
collateral
proceedings,
would
we
think,
remove
from
the
sentencing
judge
or
intend
to
remove
from
the
sentencing
judge
direct
and
immediate
control
in
proceedings.
we
think
the
emphasis
of
townsend
and
sain,
fainted
away
in
the
sanders
case,
is
that
the
habeas
judge
--
sentencing
judge
is
to
exercise
close
control
over
the
proceedings.
deposition
on
discovery
under
the
civil
rules
is
governed
by
entirely
different
criteria.
it
is
party-focused
with
the
judge
settling
disputes
as
to
the
particulars
of
the
discovery
after
the
fact.
it
is
only
after
a
notice
of
deposition
or
written
interrogatories
is
served
that
he
may
decide
to
limit
the
fact-finding
on
a
showing
of
good
cause.
in
the
--
in
most
instances
under
the
federal
civil
rules,
depositions
and
discovery
may
be
sought
without
leave
of
court,
as
we
read
the
rules.
the
government's
control
essentially
is
a
referee.
we
think
to
grant
such
broad
range
in
discovery
procedures
as
automatic
attributes
of
2255
is
to
create
a
real
danger
of
possible
abuse
of
the
writ.
it
is,
thus,
not
unreasonable
to
forecast
that
even
the
most
conclusorary
allegations
will
be
followed
by
wide
demands
for
interrogatories
and
depositions
of
government
prosecutors
that
have
been
investigated,
etcetera.
of
course,
the
court
may
prevent
this
procedure,
but
only
after
the
delay
of
harassment
which
is
--
it
seems
to
us
was
wholly
at
odds
with
the
prompt
resolution
of
the
const
--
question
of
unconstitutional
restraint
that
2255
talks
to.
in
short,
whatever
benefit
may
be
derived
by
the
deposition
and
discovery
in
a
particular
case,
these
benefits,
we
think,
are
wholly
disproportionate
to
the
delay,
opportunity
for
harassment,
collateral
investigation,
uncertainty,
and
loss
of
direct
control
by
the
sentencing
judge
over
the
proceedings.
if
testimonial
facts
need
development,
they
can
appropriately
be
developed
at
the
hearing
or
by
the
evidentiary
deposition
route.
any
change
in
this
regard,
we
think,
should
come
from
the
rule
makers
or,
principally,
from
congress.
i
would
like
to
add
a
word
as
to
our
view
on
the
question
of
power
independent
of
the
rules.
we
do
not
think
this
question
of
--
that
question
is
necessarily
raised
in
this
case
by
virtue
of
eth
ninth
circuit,
as
we
read
the
opinion,
essentially
finding
that
there
was
no
authority
under
the
federal
civil
rules
and
no
specific
authority
under
2246.
the
opinion
did
not
touch
beyond
that.
nevertheless,
since
the
issue
has
been
argued
and
briefed
and
we
have
indicated
in
our
brief
that
we
have
a
position
on
this,
we
believe
that
such
a
power
does
exist.
i
would
summarily
like
to
state
our
views
in
this
regard.
we
think
this
power
is
part
of
the
equity
power
of
the
sentencing
or
habeas
judge,
and
this
court
has
recognized
in
fay
and
noia,
brown
against
allen,
and
in
the
language
of
this
court
has
used
in
its
recent
decisions
in
sanders
and
townsend
against
sain
that
the
judge
is
“free
to
adopt
any
appropriate
means
for
inquiry
into
the
legality
of
the
prisoner's
detention,
and
the
power
of
inquiry
on
federal
habeas
corpus
is
plenary.”
in
answer
to
your
question,
mr.
justice
fortas,
the
government's
position
is
that
the
power
exists.
however,
we
think
the
power
should
be
used
quite
sparingly
only
in
the
rarest
of
circumstances
since
the
2255
route
provides
the
basic
framework
for
resolving
these
issues.
an
illustration
of
a
possible
fact-finding
situation,
i
think,
is
machibroda
where
the
facts
--
in
368
us,
where
the
facts
were
--
claim
was
made
that
a
defendant
had
spoken
to
government
counsel
on
three
occasions
in
prison.
the
government
counsel,
in
effect,
coerced
the
plea
of
guilty,
and
the
question
arose
whether
the
prisoner
was
--
need
to
be
present
at
a
hearing
and,
mr.
justice
stewart
pointed
out,
the
sentencing
judge
uses
common
sense.
that
was
the
kind
of
thing
where
the
facts
were
not
in
dispute
where
--
that
outside
the
record
but
easily
available
and
the
prisoner
would
not
be
--
not
need
to
be
at
such
a
hearing.
this
is
the
kind
of
fact
finding,
i
think,
that
exists
in
the
sentencing
judge
of
the
2255.
we
--
for
example,
there
might
be
a
case
where
there
are
some
very
extensive
scientific
records
or
examinations,
physical
examinations
on
a
claim
of
mental
incompetency,
and
the
sentencing
judge
may
feel
that,
well,
that
these
may
be
or
not
in
the
actual
record.
he
may
feel
that
the
opportunity
of
the
defense
counsel
to
examine
them
prior
to
the
actual
hearing
might
be
appropriate
to
advance
the
purposes
of
the
hearing.
what
we're
really
saying
is,
yes,
there
is
power
sparingly
to
be
employed,
very
sparingly
to
be
utilized,
and
under
direct
control
of
the
sentencing
judge.
i
might
emphasize
that
we
recognize
the
dangers
of
extensive
deposition
and
other
interrogatory
pre-trial
proceedings
and
we
do
not
think
that
the
judge,
as
a
matter
of
course,
should
take
this
route.
on
the
contrary,
we
think
it
should
be
the
rare
very
unusual
instance,
and
we
also
think
that
the
basic
way
the
facts
are
to
be
developed
is
at
the
2255
hearing
that
is
spelled
out
in
the
statute.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
i
think
--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
well,
i
think,
in
this
case,
as
i
read
the
record,
the
district
judge
did
not
exercise
any
power
except
the
automatic
application
of
the
rules.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
well,
to
the
only
extent,
the
only
argument
made
by
the
government
in
the
record,
i
believe
it's
in
page
3
(a).
the
only
response
by
the
government
--
by
the
state
of
california
was
that
the
court
had
no
power
under
rule
81
(a)
(2),
i
am
looking
for
the
point
in
the
record,
had
no
power
under
rule
81
(a)
(2)
to
grant
discovery.
there
was
no
discussion
at
all
concerning
any
additional
power
and
there's
no
indication,
it's
true.
the
district
judge
didn't
indicate
upon
what
he
based
his
decision.
there's
no
indication
that
there
was
any
suggestion
the
court
was
exercising
discretion
in
this
case.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
to
that
--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
well,
on
the
assumption
that
the
civil
rules
--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
but
the
argument
was
that
the
civil
rules
of
discovery
do
not
apply
at
all.
petitioner
deposed
as
if
the
rules
automatically
applied.
presumably,
if
the
rules
automatically
applied,
the
judge
had
very
little
discretion.
it
seemed
to
me
that
its'
hard
to
tell
on
this
record
precisely
what
he
did.
the
suggestion
seemed
to
go
that
he
relied
on
the
automatic
application
of
the
rule.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
yes.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
the
answer,
i
think
that
this
is
the
kind
of
case
where
this
can
be
a
very
fairly
developed
hearing
as
you
pointed
out,
mr.
justice
stewart.
this
is
the
kind
of
information
which
will
be,
perhaps,
available
to
the
officer
who
made
the
arrest.
he
could
be
called
as
a
witness
at
the
hearing.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
appeals
that
this
case
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
thank
you.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
now,
i
don't
quite
get
you,
mr.
justice,
i
--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
the
effect
is
that
it's
been
held
that
they
couldn't
do
it.
all
that
i
was
suggesting
is
that
the
issue
of
inherent
power
as
opposed
to
the
question
of
statutory
power
was
not
fully
developed
below.
this
is
essentially
--
this
is
what
i'm
directing
my
argument
to,
and
the
second
part
of
the
response
--
the
second
part
of
mr.
justice
stewart's
question,
i
said
that,
in
this
case,
it
seemed
to
me
that
it
would
be
appropriate
to
determine
these
facts
at
a
hearing.
i
am
--
i
find
difficulty
in
finding
that
the
district
judge
or
the
court
of
appeals
really
dealt
with
the
question
of
inherent
power
at
all.
sure,
the
order
or
determination
indicated
that
we
had
power,
at
least
the
district
court
had
power,
but
the
district
court
really
never
indicated
on
it
that
it
was
exercising
any
inherent
powers.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
i
think
that
--
that,
no
--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
the
--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
well,
as
--
i
think
that
the
power
does
exist.
i
do
think,
however,
that
there
is
specified
statutory
procedures
which
provide
for
the
normal
and
traditional
way
of
resolving
these
issues.
i
have
2255
which
deals
in
terms
with
these
procedures.
all
i'm
suggesting
is
that,
as
the
opinions
of
this
court
has
repeatedly
suggested
in
brown
against
allen,
fay
and
noia,
townsend
and
sain
that,
in
the
last
analysis,
the
habeas
or
the
sentencing
judge
must
exercise
equitable
discretion
in
the
premises.
all
i'm
suggesting
is
--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
no,
i
--
as
you
would
say,
the
power
exists
--
i
think
the
power
exists
to
be
used
very
sparingly
in
light
of
the
existence
of
these
detailed
and
specific
statute
setting
forth
the
procedures.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
i
would
have
to
say,
yes.
there
would
be
some
power.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
the
federal
government
argues
essentially
that
the
statutory
scheme
set
forth
in
2255
provides
the
traditional
normal
way
of
dealing
with
2255
proceedings.
that,
however
--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
yes,
i
think--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
i
think
--i
think
2246
further
supports
the
view
that
there
is
n
--
that
there
is
very
narrow
use
to
be
made
of
any
power
outside
of
this
statutory
scheme
that
that,
in
effect,
22--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
i
would
have
to
say
that
the
power,
yes,
does
exist.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
well,
i
--
i
think
i
would
rather
talk
about
it
in
terms
of
the
equitable
power
necessary
to--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
whatever
it
--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
it
could
be
argued.
i
think
--
and
the
state
--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
and
the
state
has
argued
it.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
the
state
has,
but
the
federal
government
doesn't
argue
it.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
yes,
it
is.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
no.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
but,
may
i
add
in
response
to
the
question
that
this
is
--
we
say
that
the
power
spelled
out
in
the
statute
that,
essentially,
there
should
be
a
hearing
as
provided
by
statute.
all
we
are
suggesting
is
that
there
may
be
a
case
where
a
sentencing
judge
or
a
habeas
judge,
deems
it
appropriate
for
that
particular
case
in
the
interest
of
justice,
finds
it
essential
to
hold
some
pre-trial
discovery.
the
federal
government

mr.

mr.

mr.

if
i
can
clarify
that
the
--
yes,
sir.
essentially,
our
arguments
are
directed
to
a
2255.
it
--
it
could
be
argued
that
the
provisions
dealing
with
habeas
corpus
are
more
detailed
and
set
forth
the
complete
power
and
don't
permit
for
the
exercise
of
inherent
powers.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
i
agree.
there
are
problems
of
federalism
and
most
of
other
problems
that
aren't
applicable
to
2255.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
now,
perhaps
i
over
spoke,
in
terms
of
the
government's
interest
is
essentially
the
2255,
and
the
--
basically,
the
2255.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
yes,
and
--
but,
all
i
am
suggesting
is
that
this
is
further
reason
not
to
utilize
any
of
this
additional
existing
power.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
well,
to
the
extent
that
the
statutes
--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
i'm
suggesting
that
2255
spells
out
certain
procedures.
now,
the
habeas
corpus
statues,
other
than
2255,
spell
out
more
detailed
procedures.
essentially,
my
argument
is
that
there
is
an
equitable
power
beyond
the
language
of
the
statutes
to
be
sparingly
exercised,
but
our
essential
focus
is
on
2255.
we
think,
perhaps,
the
answer
is
that
the
power
in
the
habeas
--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
i
would
think
it
would
have
to
depend
upon
the
particular
case
and
the
particular
needs
faced
by
the
sentencing
judge.
i
cannot
say
that
none
should
get
it
under
2255.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
it
needs
that
the
judge
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
needs
that
the
judge
deems
appropriate
to
resolve
the
issue
of
unconstitutional
restraint.
thank
you.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
government's
interest
--
the
federal
government's
in
this
case
is
substantial
since
we're
concerned
that
any
ruling
as
to
the
automatic
applicability
of
the
civil
rules
of
discovery
in
habeas
would,
as
a
matter
of
course,
it
seems
to
us,
require
the
conclusion
that
they
apply
equally
to
proceedings
under
2255
a
statutory
counterpart
in
habeas
corpus.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
yes.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
well
--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
20
--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
well,
it
is
on
the
face
of
2255
are
the
steps
in
the
criminal
clause
itself.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
well,
what
we
think
2255
essentially
is
basically,
as
this
court
has
suggested
in
hickman
--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
this
is
quite
true
but,
of
course,
the
last
3part
of
2255
does
suggest
that
--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
habeas
corpus
cases,
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
well,
principally,
because
we
were
concerned
of
the
problem
of
suggesting
that
a
state
applicant
might
get
discovery
with,
as
mine
or
an
appellee
points
out,
this
is
a
substantial
rather
than
a
procedural
rule
to
say
that
a
ha--a
2255
applicant
is
an
entirely
different
situation.
i
agree
with
you,
your
honor,
that
the
specifics
of
2255
--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
i
believe
the
state
is
still
the
greater
numbered.
we've
set
it
out
at
page
12
of
our
brief.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
i
have
found
some
additional
figures
for
the
court
with
respect
to
2255
applications.
in
19
--
fiscal
1967,
the
administrative
office
of
the
courts
advices
me
that
932
2255
applications
were
disposed
of.
it's
not
clear
when
they
were
instituted.
about
90%
or
a
little
more
than
842
of
those
were
disposed
pre-trial,
6
were
terminate
after
a
pre-trial
conference,
and
19
was
--
were
withdrawn,
65
were
given
hearings.
now,
i
was
unable
to
get
specific
details
of
when
--
of
the
percentage
of
actual
denials
and
grants,
what
happened
at
the
hearing.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
2255,
yes.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
i
wasn't
able
to
get
comparable
statistics
as
to
the
state
material
nor
was
i
able
to
get
an
actual
breakdown.
i
gather
this
had
been
done
at
the
time
of
brown
and
allen.
mr.
justice
frankfurter
had
asked
the
administrative
office
of
the
courts
to
do
this
in
the
summer
during
that
prior
argument
to
that
case,
but
--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
i
would
--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
all
the
--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
yes.
i
think
this
is
quite
clear.
even
the
figures
in
our
brief
on
page
12
point
this
out.
i
would
like
also
to
note
that,
initially,
that
government's
view
is
not
that
the
sentencing
judge
on
the
2255
is
without
power
wholly
apart
from
the
federal
civil
rules
to
permit
discovery
fact-finding
in
the
rare
and
unusual
case.
essentially,
our
position
is
that
the
civil
rules
of
discovery
deposition
do
not
apply
the
2255
prosi
--
proceedings.
one
looks
at
the
statute,
as
mr.
justice
brennan
points
out,
the
claimant
has
the
obligation
to
set
forth
the
facts
that
was
raised
in
issue
and,
most
significantly,
the
sentencing
court
is
then
to
examine
the
motion
of
files
and
records
of
the
case
to
see
if
these
documents
conclusively
show
that
the
prisoner
is
not
entitled
to
any
relief.
if
he
so
concludes,
he
shall
dismiss
or
deny
the
application.
if
he
does
not,
he
can
notify
the
us
attorney
and
schedule
a
hearing
to
determine
the
issues
and
make
findings
of
fact
and
conclusions
of
law.
moreover,
whenever
a
hearing
is
to
be
held,
it
is
required
to
be
held
promptly.
it
is
at
such
a
hearing
that
the
issues
will
be
explored
and
it
is
based
upon
the
facts
induced
on
such
hearing
that
the
sentencing
judge
is
to
make
his
findings
of
fact
and
conclusions
of
law.
what
congress
has
done
perhaps
extend
to
the
practice
in
a
criminal
case
but,
in
effect
on
the
2255,
it
has
set
up
a
pleading
method
of
evaluating
the
claim
and
perhaps
this
is
the
same
way
of
saying,
mr.
justice
brennan,
which
takes
account
quite
clearly
of
the
fact
that
the
sentencing
judge
is
now
operating
on
a
clean
slate,
but
against
the
background
of
a
criminal
conviction
which
might
have
fully
resolved
the
issue
so
that
it
would
be
re-litigated
in
2255.
and
finally,
it
has
recognized
that,
at
the
hearing,
the
sentencing
judge
and
no
one
else
has
the
obligation
to
determine
if
the
restraint
alleged
is
unconstitutional.
on
the
other
hand,
the
crucial
thrust
of
the
deposition
interrogatory
practice
under
the
civil
rules
is
just
the
other
way.
in
a
large
measure,
its
purpose
is
to
supplant
the
pleading
in
trial
development
of
fact
that
is
the
basic--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
well,
we're
in
issue
--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
i
think
--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
i
think
the
statute,
though,
puts
the
primary
focus
on
the
examination
of
the
files
and
records.
if
they
conclusively
show
that
the
prisoner
is
entitled
to
no
relief,
the
judge
must
dismiss
the
motion.
now,
if
that
is
inappropriate
then,
normally,
he
would
hold
a
hearing
and
presumably
would
appoint
counsel.
we
--
we
don't
think
that
2255
is
simply
an
extension
of
the
criminal
case
per
se.
what
we
think
it
is,
is
a
particularized
method
by
which
congress
sought
to
attack
--
permit
attack
collaterally
upon
convictions
because
2255
still
provides
that
if
the
relief
is
insufficient
or
unavailable
or
that
the
habeas
corpus
might
provide
it
a
proper
remedy.
now,
this
court
has
pointed
out
on
more
than
one
occasion
that
the
relief
under
2255
is
the
substantial
equivalent
of
the
relief
under
habeas
corpus.
i
think
it
might
be
a
serious
problem
to
consider
2255
simply
of
an
extension
of
the
criminal
case.
then,
i
presume
it
could
be
argued
that
relief
under
the
habeas
statutes
would
still
be
available.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
no,
i
agree.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
i
agree.
i
think
that
2255
is
a
particularized
method
set
up
by
congress
to
deal
with
post
conviction
alleged
constitutional
defects.
in
civil
discovery,
the
vital
developments
of
the
fact
is
to
stem
from
the
pre-trial
examination
and,
primarily,
to
afford
a
way
out,
perhaps,
for
out-of-court
settlement
either
by
agreement
of
the
parties
with
summary
judgment.
alternatively,
if
the
case
needs
to
go
to
trial,
discovery
provides
a
way
to
assure
that
no
relevant
facts
in
either
party's
case
are
hidden
at
the
trial.
in
ordinary
civil
litigation,
wholly
unrelated
to
a
pre-existing
criminal
conviction,
the
benefits,
thus
arrived,
are
deemed
to
outweigh
the
time
expended
in
such
deposition
and
cross-deposition
practice,
but
such
practice
is
wholly
at
odds,
as
i
say,
with
the
scheme
and
definite
precision
of
section
2255,
and
it
raises
the
danger
of
logging
upon
time-consuming
possibly
irrelevant
investigation
better
spent
at
a
hearing.
but,
perhaps
most
significantly
from
our
point
of
view,
the
automatic
adoption
of
the
deposition
interrogatory
rules
of
civil
discovery
in
collateral
proceedings,
would
we
think,
remove
from
the
sentencing
judge
or
intend
to
remove
from
the
sentencing
judge
direct
and
immediate
control
in
proceedings.
we
think
the
emphasis
of
townsend
and
sain,
fainted
away
in
the
sanders
case,
is
that
the
habeas
judge
--
sentencing
judge
is
to
exercise
close
control
over
the
proceedings.
deposition
on
discovery
under
the
civil
rules
is
governed
by
entirely
different
criteria.
it
is
party-focused
with
the
judge
settling
disputes
as
to
the
particulars
of
the
discovery
after
the
fact.
it
is
only
after
a
notice
of
deposition
or
written
interrogatories
is
served
that
he
may
decide
to
limit
the
fact-finding
on
a
showing
of
good
cause.
in
the
--
in
most
instances
under
the
federal
civil
rules,
depositions
and
discovery
may
be
sought
without
leave
of
court,
as
we
read
the
rules.
the
government's
control
essentially
is
a
referee.
we
think
to
grant
such
broad
range
in
discovery
procedures
as
automatic
attributes
of
2255
is
to
create
a
real
danger
of
possible
abuse
of
the
writ.
it
is,
thus,
not
unreasonable
to
forecast
that
even
the
most
conclusorary
allegations
will
be
followed
by
wide
demands
for
interrogatories
and
depositions
of
government
prosecutors
that
have
been
investigated,
etcetera.
of
course,
the
court
may
prevent
this
procedure,
but
only
after
the
delay
of
harassment
which
is
--
it
seems
to
us
was
wholly
at
odds
with
the
prompt
resolution
of
the
const
--
question
of
unconstitutional
restraint
that
2255
talks
to.
in
short,
whatever
benefit
may
be
derived
by
the
deposition
and
discovery
in
a
particular
case,
these
benefits,
we
think,
are
wholly
disproportionate
to
the
delay,
opportunity
for
harassment,
collateral
investigation,
uncertainty,
and
loss
of
direct
control
by
the
sentencing
judge
over
the
proceedings.
if
testimonial
facts
need
development,
they
can
appropriately
be
developed
at
the
hearing
or
by
the
evidentiary
deposition
route.
any
change
in
this
regard,
we
think,
should
come
from
the
rule
makers
or,
principally,
from
congress.
i
would
like
to
add
a
word
as
to
our
view
on
the
question
of
power
independent
of
the
rules.
we
do
not
think
this
question
of
--
that
question
is
necessarily
raised
in
this
case
by
virtue
of
eth
ninth
circuit,
as
we
read
the
opinion,
essentially
finding
that
there
was
no
authority
under
the
federal
civil
rules
and
no
specific
authority
under
2246.
the
opinion
did
not
touch
beyond
that.
nevertheless,
since
the
issue
has
been
argued
and
briefed
and
we
have
indicated
in
our
brief
that
we
have
a
position
on
this,
we
believe
that
such
a
power
does
exist.
i
would
summarily
like
to
state
our
views
in
this
regard.
we
think
this
power
is
part
of
the
equity
power
of
the
sentencing
or
habeas
judge,
and
this
court
has
recognized
in
fay
and
noia,
brown
against
allen,
and
in
the
language
of
this
court
has
used
in
its
recent
decisions
in
sanders
and
townsend
against
sain
that
the
judge
is
“free
to
adopt
any
appropriate
means
for
inquiry
into
the
legality
of
the
prisoner's
detention,
and
the
power
of
inquiry
on
federal
habeas
corpus
is
plenary.”
in
answer
to
your
question,
mr.
justice
fortas,
the
government's
position
is
that
the
power
exists.
however,
we
think
the
power
should
be
used
quite
sparingly
only
in
the
rarest
of
circumstances
since
the
2255
route
provides
the
basic
framework
for
resolving
these
issues.
an
illustration
of
a
possible
fact-finding
situation,
i
think,
is
machibroda
where
the
facts
--
in
368
us,
where
the
facts
were
--
claim
was
made
that
a
defendant
had
spoken
to
government
counsel
on
three
occasions
in
prison.
the
government
counsel,
in
effect,
coerced
the
plea
of
guilty,
and
the
question
arose
whether
the
prisoner
was
--
need
to
be
present
at
a
hearing
and,
mr.
justice
stewart
pointed
out,
the
sentencing
judge
uses
common
sense.
that
was
the
kind
of
thing
where
the
facts
were
not
in
dispute
where
--
that
outside
the
record
but
easily
available
and
the
prisoner
would
not
be
--
not
need
to
be
at
such
a
hearing.
this
is
the
kind
of
fact
finding,
i
think,
that
exists
in
the
sentencing
judge
of
the
2255.
we
--
for
example,
there
might
be
a
case
where
there
are
some
very
extensive
scientific
records
or
examinations,
physical
examinations
on
a
claim
of
mental
incompetency,
and
the
sentencing
judge
may
feel
that,
well,
that
these
may
be
or
not
in
the
actual
record.
he
may
feel
that
the
opportunity
of
the
defense
counsel
to
examine
them
prior
to
the
actual
hearing
might
be
appropriate
to
advance
the
purposes
of
the
hearing.
what
we're
really
saying
is,
yes,
there
is
power
sparingly
to
be
employed,
very
sparingly
to
be
utilized,
and
under
direct
control
of
the
sentencing
judge.
i
might
emphasize
that
we
recognize
the
dangers
of
extensive
deposition
and
other
interrogatory
pre-trial
proceedings
and
we
do
not
think
that
the
judge,
as
a
matter
of
course,
should
take
this
route.
on
the
contrary,
we
think
it
should
be
the
rare
very
unusual
instance,
and
we
also
think
that
the
basic
way
the
facts
are
to
be
developed
is
at
the
2255
hearing
that
is
spelled
out
in
the
statute.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
i
think
--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
well,
i
think,
in
this
case,
as
i
read
the
record,
the
district
judge
did
not
exercise
any
power
except
the
automatic
application
of
the
rules.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
well,
to
the
only
extent,
the
only
argument
made
by
the
government
in
the
record,
i
believe
it's
in
page
3
(a).
the
only
response
by
the
government
--
by
the
state
of
california
was
that
the
court
had
no
power
under
rule
81
(a)
(2),
i
am
looking
for
the
point
in
the
record,
had
no
power
under
rule
81
(a)
(2)
to
grant
discovery.
there
was
no
discussion
at
all
concerning
any
additional
power
and
there's
no
indication,
it's
true.
the
district
judge
didn't
indicate
upon
what
he
based
his
decision.
there's
no
indication
that
there
was
any
suggestion
the
court
was
exercising
discretion
in
this
case.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
to
that
--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
well,
on
the
assumption
that
the
civil
rules
--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
but
the
argument
was
that
the
civil
rules
of
discovery
do
not
apply
at
all.
petitioner
deposed
as
if
the
rules
automatically
applied.
presumably,
if
the
rules
automatically
applied,
the
judge
had
very
little
discretion.
it
seemed
to
me
that
its'
hard
to
tell
on
this
record
precisely
what
he
did.
the
suggestion
seemed
to
go
that
he
relied
on
the
automatic
application
of
the
rule.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
yes.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
the
answer,
i
think
that
this
is
the
kind
of
case
where
this
can
be
a
very
fairly
developed
hearing
as
you
pointed
out,
mr.
justice
stewart.
this
is
the
kind
of
information
which
will
be,
perhaps,
available
to
the
officer
who
made
the
arrest.
he
could
be
called
as
a
witness
at
the
hearing.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
appeals
that
this
case
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
thank
you.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
now,
i
don't
quite
get
you,
mr.
justice,
i
--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
the
effect
is
that
it's
been
held
that
they
couldn't
do
it.
all
that
i
was
suggesting
is
that
the
issue
of
inherent
power
as
opposed
to
the
question
of
statutory
power
was
not
fully
developed
below.
this
is
essentially
--
this
is
what
i'm
directing
my
argument
to,
and
the
second
part
of
the
response
--
the
second
part
of
mr.
justice
stewart's
question,
i
said
that,
in
this
case,
it
seemed
to
me
that
it
would
be
appropriate
to
determine
these
facts
at
a
hearing.
i
am
--
i
find
difficulty
in
finding
that
the
district
judge
or
the
court
of
appeals
really
dealt
with
the
question
of
inherent
power
at
all.
sure,
the
order
or
determination
indicated
that
we
had
power,
at
least
the
district
court
had
power,
but
the
district
court
really
never
indicated
on
it
that
it
was
exercising
any
inherent
powers.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
i
think
that
--
that,
no
--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
the
--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
well,
as
--
i
think
that
the
power
does
exist.
i
do
think,
however,
that
there
is
specified
statutory
procedures
which
provide
for
the
normal
and
traditional
way
of
resolving
these
issues.
i
have
2255
which
deals
in
terms
with
these
procedures.
all
i'm
suggesting
is
that,
as
the
opinions
of
this
court
has
repeatedly
suggested
in
brown
against
allen,
fay
and
noia,
townsend
and
sain
that,
in
the
last
analysis,
the
habeas
or
the
sentencing
judge
must
exercise
equitable
discretion
in
the
premises.
all
i'm
suggesting
is
--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
no,
i
--
as
you
would
say,
the
power
exists
--
i
think
the
power
exists
to
be
used
very
sparingly
in
light
of
the
existence
of
these
detailed
and
specific
statute
setting
forth
the
procedures.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
i
would
have
to
say,
yes.
there
would
be
some
power.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
the
federal
government
argues
essentially
that
the
statutory
scheme
set
forth
in
2255
provides
the
traditional
normal
way
of
dealing
with
2255
proceedings.
that,
however
--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
yes,
i
think--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
i
think
--i
think
2246
further
supports
the
view
that
there
is
n
--
that
there
is
very
narrow
use
to
be
made
of
any
power
outside
of
this
statutory
scheme
that
that,
in
effect,
22--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
i
would
have
to
say
that
the
power,
yes,
does
exist.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
well,
i
--
i
think
i
would
rather
talk
about
it
in
terms
of
the
equitable
power
necessary
to--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
whatever
it
--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
it
could
be
argued.
i
think
--
and
the
state
--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
and
the
state
has
argued
it.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
the
state
has,
but
the
federal
government
doesn't
argue
it.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
yes,
it
is.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
no.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
but,
may
i
add
in
response
to
the
question
that
this
is
--
we
say
that
the
power
spelled
out
in
the
statute
that,
essentially,
there
should
be
a
hearing
as
provided
by
statute.
all
we
are
suggesting
is
that
there
may
be
a
case
where
a
sentencing
judge
or
a
habeas
judge,
deems
it
appropriate
for
that
particular
case
in
the
interest
of
justice,
finds
it
essential
to
hold
some
pre-trial
discovery.
the
federal
government
--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
beyond
anything
--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
anything
--
they're
beyond
anything
that's
--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
i
--
if
i
can
clarify
that
the
--
yes,
sir.
essentially,
our
arguments
are
directed
to
a
2255.
it
--
it
could
be
argued
that
the
provisions
dealing
with
habeas
corpus
are
more
detailed
and
set
forth
the
complete
power
and
don't
permit
for
the
exercise
of
inherent
powers.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
i
agree.
there
are
problems
of
federalism
and
most
of
other
problems
that
aren't
applicable
to
2255.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
now,
perhaps
i
over
spoke,
in
terms
of
the
government's
interest
is
essentially
the
2255,
and
the
--
basically,
the
2255.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
yes,
and
--
but,
all
i
am
suggesting
is
that
this
is
further
reason
not
to
utilize
any
of
this
additional
existing
power.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
well,
to
the
extent
that
the
statutes
--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
i'm
suggesting
that
2255
spells
out
certain
procedures.
now,
the
habeas
corpus
statues,
other
than
2255,
spell
out
more
detailed
procedures.
essentially,
my
argument
is
that
there
is
an
equitable
power
beyond
the
language
of
the
statutes
to
be
sparingly
exercised,
but
our
essential
focus
is
on
2255.
we
think,
perhaps,
the
answer
is
that
the
power
in
the
habeas
--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
i
would
think
it
would
have
to
depend
upon
the
particular
case
and
the
particular
needs
faced
by
the
sentencing
judge.
i
cannot
say
that
none
should
get
it
under
2255.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
it
needs
that
the
judge
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
needs
that
the
judge
deems
appropriate
to
resolve
the
issue
of
unconstitutional
restraint.
thank
you.
