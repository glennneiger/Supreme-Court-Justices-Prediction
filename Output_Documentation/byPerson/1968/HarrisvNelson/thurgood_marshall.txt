mr.
granberg,
does
the
habeas
corpus
procedure
a
civil
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and,
it's
just
as
much
asserted
for
the
truth
as
any
other
civil
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and,
therefore,
should
have
all
of
the
necessary
procedures
to
ensure
truth.
are
you
sure
you
want
to
be
with
that
last
one.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
isn't
the
procedure
of
written
interrogatories
another
procedure
to
get
closer
to
the
truth?
justice
thurgood
marshall
isn't
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
still
admit
that
it
would
help
to
get
to
the
truth.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
your
question,
it's
not
mine.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
your
question.
justice
thurgood
marshall
my
question
is,
it's
been
recognized
that,
in
all
other
civil
actions,
this
is
good
but
it's
not
good
for
habeas
corpus?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
you
say
that's
what
the
law
is?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
think
that
it's
less
important
to
determine
whether
a
man
is
in
jail
for
his
life
unconstitutionally
than
it
is
to
find
out
where
the
man
has
been
overcharged
$10,000
in
one
dissent?
justice
thurgood
marshall
your
idea
is
that
habeas
corpus
is
an
entirely
different
type
of
civil
action.
justice
thurgood
marshall
entirely
different.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
is
this
then?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
have
a
petitioner,
don't
you?
no
respondent?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what's
the
measure
of
proof,
the
same?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it's
a
burden
of
proof.
justice
thurgood
marshall
isn't
the
proof
the
same?
what
makes
it
so
different?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
that's
the
question
asserted.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
the
same
to
point
to
the
fact
that
discovery
would
help
him
because
his
burden
is
tougher?
justice
thurgood
marshall
was
that
what
you're
arguing?
justice
thurgood
marshall
are
you
getting
to
the
point
now
where
you're
going
to
give
counsel
in
these
proceedings?
because,
you
make
them
very
criminal.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you're
making
it
an
extension
of
the
criminal
proceeding.
