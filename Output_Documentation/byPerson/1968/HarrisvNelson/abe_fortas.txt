justice
abe
fortas
may
i
ask
you
whether
there's
any
indication
on
the
record
here
as
to
which
theory
the
district
court
used
in
ordering
that
the
interrogatories
be
answered?
justice
abe
fortas
you
don't
know
as
we
--
justice
abe
fortas
in
this
case,
whether
that
the
court
felt
compelled
to
do
so
by
the
rules
or
whether
the
court
was
acting
as
a
matter
discretionary
power?
justice
abe
fortas
i
would
--
just
exactly
how
would
this
work?
is
this,
in
effect,
a
writ
asking
that
the
warden
proceed
to
find
out
the
answers?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
mean,
actually.
justice
abe
fortas
what
would
actually
happen?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
it's
quite
a
different
sort
of
thing
then
than
the
civil
interrogatory
because
what
you're
doing,
what
the
prisoner
here
is
asking
is
that
the
state,
the
commandant,
to
procure
information
for
him,
namely
the
answers
to
these
questions.
in
the
usual
civil
interrogatory,
of
course,
you
address
the
interrogatory
to
the
person
who's
in
possession
of
the
information.
now,
what
this
is,
this
is
really
a
--
what
you're
asking
us
to
approve
here
is
a
procedure
by
which
a
state
is
--
the
state
is
commandant
to
obtain
request
for
certain
information
and,
technically,
i
suppose
that
if
we
accept
your
argument,
it
would
mean
that
jailhouse
lawyer
or
the
convicted
person
himself
could
sit
down
and
write
a
set
of
interrogatories
and,
without
any
--
and
having
filed
his
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
without
a
court
intervention.
justice
abe
fortas
you'd
have
to
get
the
court
to
approve.
justice
abe
fortas
how
about
depositions
upon
written
interrogatories?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
under
the
civil
rules,
if
i
star
--
if
i'm
involved
in
the
civil
suit
at
that
time
and
so
on,
taking
into
account,
i
can
just
serve
notice
on
somebody
that
i'm
going
to
take
his
interrogatory.
i
don't
need
to
take
his
deposition
and
i
don't
need
court
approval,
isn't
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
is
that
in
the
civil
rules?
justice
abe
fortas
i
--
i
listen
with
interest
to
your
argument
about
rule
30
but,
actually,
if
you
say
that
the
civil
rules
apply
in
habeas
proceedings.
i
suppose
it's
at
least
arguable
that
a
precedent
can
server
here
--
can
serve
notice
on
frances
jenkins,
or
whatever
her
name
is,
that
that
prisoner
wants
to
take
her
deposition,
am
i
right?
justice
abe
fortas
aren't
you
a
little
concern
that
this
might
turn
out
to
be
occupational
therapy
for
jailhouse
inmates
with
some
certain
amount
of
inconvenience
to
the
rest
of
the
world?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
pottinger,
i
am
having
a
little
difficulty
understanding
--
justice
abe
fortas
why
the
written
interrogatory
procedure
would
not
be
effective
for
you
here.
now,
the
depositions
under
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
would
not
be
available
to
the
prisoner
here
until
he
had
filed
his
application
for
a
writ,
would
they?
justice
abe
fortas
i
know.
justice
abe
fortas
and
then
there
will
be
a
lapse
of
time.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
now,
why
couldn't,
after
he
has
filed
his
application
for
a
writ,
why
can't
he
go
to
the
court
and
say
--
and
ask
the
court
to
proceed
by
written
interrogatories?
now,
your
answer
to
that
may
be
that
the
deposition
procedures,
at
least
nominally,
mandatory.
the
judge
has
to
permit
him
to
go
ahead.
written
interrogatories,
a
judge
can
say
“well,
i
don't
chose
to
proceed
by
written
interrogatories
here,”
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
that's
right.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
whatever
it
may
be,
because
if
the
--
if
a
person
in
prison
should
proceed
by
depo
--
by
written
int
--
by,
what
do
you
call
them?
justice
abe
fortas
interrogatories
under
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure,
the
interrogatories,
presumably,
would
be
available.
they
ordinarily
are
available
to
both
parties.
justice
abe
fortas
and
the
state
can
introduce
whatever
the
defendant
--
whatever
the
prisoner
does
not
introduce.
it's
a
little
hard
to
see
that
there's
any
real
operator
difference
here
when
you
relate
the
two
procedures,
2246
and
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure,
to
the
habeas
proceeding,
except
for
the
element
of
power
and
the
judge
and
the
2246
to
say,
“no,
i'm
not
going
to
proceed
by
written
interrogatories
here.”
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
aware
of
that,
but
i
suppose
that
if
the
court
proceeds
by
affidavit,
that
he
could
accept
as
evidentiary
the
--
whatever
comes
in
on
written
interrogatories.
that
would
be
sworn
--
justice
abe
fortas
but
the
chronology
in
a
habeas
suit
--
curious
situation
of
a
habeas
case,
chronology
works
out
so,
as
i
think
you've
heard,
happily
and
very
well
put
into
us.
chronology
works
out
so
that
you
don't
have
the
usual
difference
between
discovery
--
a
pre-trial
discovery
and
the
use
on
trial
that
you
have
in
a
civil
proceeding.
justice
abe
fortas
is
there
anything
in
the
legislative
history
that
indicates
that
apart
from
the
language
of
the
statute?
justice
abe
fortas
your
position
is
that
even
if
a
prisoner
in
a
habeas
proceeding
should
make
some
sort
of
a
case
and
by
affidavit,
let
us
say,
and
a
credible
case,
then
he
comes
to
the
judge
and
asks
for
--
asks
the
judge
in
excise
of
his
inherent
power
and
discretionary
power,
power
in
the
whole
writs
or
whatnot,
to
authorize
him
to
serve
written
interrogatories
on
named
people,
that
the
court
would
not
have
such
power.
is
that
your
position?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that's
pretty
--
those
are
pretty
confusing
concepts,
unless
their
particularized.
just
take
the
case
that
i
put
to
you.
a
prisoner
makes
out
a
prima
facie
case
by
affidavit.
judge
is
persuaded
that
it's
a
prima
facie
case.
the
prisoner
says
“i
want
to
--
in
order
to
prove
this
out,
i've
got
to
engage
in
some
discovery.
so,
please
permit
me
to
serve
written
interrogatories
on
certain
persons.”
now,
is
it
your
position
that
the
court
does
not
have
power
to
do
it
or
is
it
your
position
that
the
court
could
do
it
under
the
habeas
statute,
2240
--
whatever
it
is?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
don't
care
what
you
call
this,
whether
--
i
don't
know
whether
the
case
i
put
to
you,
you
probably
call
it
discovery
or
evidence,
but
i
put
factually
the
case
to
you.
justice
abe
fortas
the
prisoner
makes
out
a
prima
facie
case
by
affidavit
and
he
asks
the
judge
to
see
to
it
that
the
persons
res
--
plied
to
written
interrogatories
so
that
he
could
perfect
the
case
which
we
have
made
out
on
a
prima
facie
basis.
what
i
want
to
know
from
you
is
whether
your
theory
that
we
adopted
means
that
we
would
be
ruling
that
the
judge
on
the
present
state
of
the
law
has
no
power
to
do
so.
justice
abe
fortas
what's
your
answer,
yes
or
no?
justice
abe
fortas
then,
in
the
case
i
put
to
you,
your
answer
is
that
the
judge,
no
matter
--
even
though
he's
persuaded
that
the
prisoner
has
made
out
a
prima
facie
case,
the
judge
does
not
have
the
power
to
provide
a
procedure
by
which
he
may
go
further?
justice
abe
fortas
i
suppose
--
suppose
the
prisoner
says
an
evidentiary
hearing
is
the
final
ultimate
objective.
the
prisoner
says
“i
made
out
a
prima
facie
case.
i
need
more
evidence
and
i
want
you
to
authorize
written
interrogatories.”
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
trying
to
say
that
just
as
clearly
as
i
can,
but
i
guess
i'd
better
quit
because
i'm
actually
questioned
as
clearly
as
i
can
put
it,
and
i'd
like
to
know
what
your
answer
is
because
i
want
to
know
what
your
theory
would
lead
us
to
in
terms
of
affirmance
or
denial
of
the
judge's
power
in
that
certain
--
in
that
situation?
justice
abe
fortas
i
can
understand
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that.
i'm
asking
about
your
theory.
are
you
contending
for
a
ruling
by
this
court
which
would
say
that
in
the
case
i
put
to
you
the
district
judge
has
no
power
to
authorize
written
interrogatories?
i
don't
--
i
think
either
your
theory
does
or
doesn't
lead
--
doesn't
involve
that.
maybe
i'm
oversimplifying
it,
but
i
really
don't
believe
so.
justice
abe
fortas
you're
telling
me
to
work
it
--
justice
abe
fortas
you're
telling
me
to
work
it
out
for
myself.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
but
the
fact
is
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
may
i
ask
you
whether
there's
any
indication
on
the
record
here
as
to
which
theory
the
district
court
used
in
ordering
that
the
interrogatories
be
answered?
justice
abe
fortas
you
don't
know
as
we
--
justice
abe
fortas
in
this
case,
whether
that
the
court
felt
compelled
to
do
so
by
the
rules
or
whether
the
court
was
acting
as
a
matter
discretionary
power?
justice
abe
fortas
i
would
--
just
exactly
how
would
this
work?
is
this,
in
effect,
a
writ
asking
that
the
warden
proceed
to
find
out
the
answers?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i

he
could
perfect
the
case
which
we
have
made
out
on
a
prima
facie
basis.
what
i
want
to
know
from
you
is
whether
your
theory
that
we
adopted
means
that
we
would
be
ruling
that
the
judge
on
the
present
state
of
the
law
has
no
power
to
do
so.
justice
abe
fortas
what's
your
answer,
yes
or
no?
justice
abe
fortas
then,
in
the
case
i
put
to
you,
your
answer
is
that
the
judge,
no
matter
--
even
though
he's
persuaded
that
the
prisoner
has
made
out
a
prima
facie
case,
the
judge
does
not
have
the
power
to
provide
a
procedure
by
which
he
may
go
further?
justice
abe
fortas
i
suppose
--
suppose
the
prisoner
says
an
evidentiary
hearing
is
the
final
ultimate
objective.
the
prisoner
says
“i
made
out
a
prima
facie
case.
i
need
more
evidence
and
i
want
you
to
authorize
written
interrogatories.”
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
trying
to
say
that
just
as
clearly
as
i
can,
but
i
guess
i'd
better
quit
because
i'm
actually
questioned
as
clearly
as
i
can
put
it,
and
i'd
like
to
know
what
your
answer
is
because
i
want
to
know
what
your
theory
would
lead
us
to
in
terms
of
affirmance
or
denial
of
the
judge's
power
in
that
certain
--
in
that
situation?
justice
abe
fortas
i
can
understand
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that.
i'm
asking
about
your
theory.
are
you
contending
for
a
ruling
by
this
court
which
would
say
that
in
the
case
i
put
to
you
the
district
judge
has
no
power
to
authorize
written
interrogatories?
i
don't
--
i
think
either
your
theory
does
or
doesn't
lead
--
doesn't
involve
that.
maybe
i'm
oversimplifying
it,
but
i
really
don't
believe
so.
justice
abe
fortas
you're
telling
me
to
work
it
--
justice
abe
fortas
you're
telling
me
to
work
it
out
for
myself.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
but
the
fact
is
that
--
