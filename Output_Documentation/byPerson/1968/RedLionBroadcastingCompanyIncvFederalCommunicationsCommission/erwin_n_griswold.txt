mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
the
first
of
two
cases
presenting
related
to
questions
but
in
different
circumstances.
in
this
case,
we
have
specific
facts
but
no
formally
announced
rule
or
regulation.
in
the
next
case,
united
states
and
federal
communications
commission
against
the
radio
television
news
directors
association
et
al.,
number
717,
we
have
a
formal
regulation
but
no
facts.
i
will
try
to
keep
my
argument
separated
as
far
as
the
two
cases
are
concern,
but
much
of
the
argument
is
necessarily
applicable
to
both
cases.
in
the
first
place,
i
would
like
to
make
it
plain
that
this
is
not
a
sudden
determination
of
the
federal
communications
commission
that
it
will
be
righteous
and
seek
to
enforce
some
kind
of
arbitrary
standards
on
the
broadcasting
industry.
on
the
contrary,
the
problem
is
one
of
long
standing.
it
goes
back
for
close
to
50
years.
the
first
traces
of
it
that
i've
seen
are
found
in
an
address
of
the
then
secretary
of
commerce
herbert
hoover
in
1924
when
the
commerce
department
was
charged
with
the
licensing
of
radio
stations,
and
he
pointed
out
that
there
were
great
problems
in
the
handling
of
this
new
medium
and
the
problems
of
seeing
that
all
points
of
view
were
properly
expressed
among
them.
in
its
foundation,
the
problem
is
inherent
in
communication
through
electromagnetic
waves.
from
the
very
beginning,
congress
and
the
federal
communications
commission
and
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
the
broadcast
industry
had
been
grouping
for
a
sound
and
workable
solution.
i'm
quite
sure
that
we
have
not
found
the
final
answer.
there's
still
room
for
improvement
through
more
thought
and
more
experience.
but
i
feel
its
substantial
progress
has
been
made
in
dealing
with
a
fundamental
and
important
issue.
let
me
start
by
referring
to
some
reflections
of
the
problem
which
are
found
in
the
basic
statute.
i
am
going
to
quote
a
few
passages
from
the
communication
act
of
1934,
but
i
would
point
out
that
virtually
all
of
these
were
also
in
the
federal
radio
act
of
1927.
the
very
opening
sentence
says
in
section
301
of
title
47,
“it
is
the
purpose
of
this
chapter
among
other
things
to
maintain
the
control
of
the
united
states
over
all
the
channels
of
interstate
and
foreign
radio
transmission,
and
to
provide
for
the
use
of
such
channels,
but
not
the
ownership
thereof
by
persons
for
limited
periods
of
time.
and
no
license
granted
under
this
section
shall
be
construed
to
create
any
right
beyond
the
terms,
conditions
and
period
of
the
license.”
in
section
303,
there
is
an
expressed
provision
that
a
license
maybe
revoked
if
the
licensee
has
transmitted
superfluous
radio
communications
or
signals
or
communications
containing
profane
or
obscene
words,
language
or
meaning.
and
i
suppose
it's
reasonably
plain
that
a
station's
license
could
be
revoked
under
that
section,
eventhough
the
language
used
was
such
that
could
not
had
been
enjoined
from
being
used
because
of
the
first
amendment.
and
then,
there
are
provisions
for
licensing
under
which,
the
commission
if
public
convenience,
interest
or
necessity
will
be
served
thereby
may
grant
licenses
for
periods
of
three
years.
and
there
are
provisions
for
revocation
of
licenses
in
case
the
station
does
not
serve
the
public
interest,
convenience
and
necessity.
there
are
provisions
for
revocation
of
licenses
in
cases
of
willful
and
repeated
violation
or,
of
or
willful
or
repeated
failure
to
observe
any
provision
of
this
chapter
or
any
rule
or
regulation
of
the
commission
authorized
by
this
chapter.
and
then,
there
is
section
315,
the
equal
time
provision,
and
i
point
out
that
that
was
included
in
the
federal
radio
act
of
1927.
it
is
thus
42
years
old,
and
in
its
particular
field,
it
is
an
expression
of
the
fairness
doctrine
under
which
if
a
station
gives
time
to
a
political
candidate,
it
must
give
equal
time
to
other
political
candidates
with
qualifications
which
were
put
in
1959
into
which
i
will
refer
a
little
later.
in
1929,
in
a
brief
which
the
commission
filed
in
the
great
lakes
case,
you
find
something
of
a
beginning
of
an
articulation
of
the
fairness
doctrine.
and
over
the
next
two
decades,
the
commission
in
a
series
of
individual
rulings
undertook
to
express
the
obligation
of
then
radio
stations
to
meet
their
requirements
of
the
fairness
doctrine,
this
being
an
interpretation
by
the
commission
of
the
standard
included
by
congress
in
the
statute
that
these
stations
must
operate
in
the
public
interest.
in
1960,
in
19
--
yes,
in
1960,
there
--
well,
let
me
wait
before
1959
and
'60.
in
1940,
in
the
ruling
in
the
mayflower
broadcasting
case,
the
commission
instructed
radio
stations
that
they
could
not
engage
in
editorializing.
this
may
or
may
not
have
been
the
right
thing
to
do,
but
it
was
an
articulation
of
the
fairness
doctrine.
there
was
concern
that
stations
with
the
great
power
they
have
could
constantly
reiterate
one
point
of
view
and
shut
off
all
others,
and
the
commission's
approach
in
1940
was
to
say
you
cannot
editorialize.
but
in
1949,
after
experienced
with
that,
the
commission
issued
its
report
on
editorializing
in
which
it
changed
its
rule
and
it
said
you
can
editorialize
but
you
must
allow
an
opportunity
for
a
response
by
responsible
people.
now,
that
was
the
situation
in
1949.
ten
years
later,
we
come
to
1959
when
after
the
lar
daly
case
which
arose
under
section
315
involving
equal
time,
there
was
great
concern
because
the
commission
and
a
court
of
appeals
had
held
that
every
candidate
was
entitled
to
equal
time,
eventhough
he
had
only
a
miniscule
support.
and
congress
amended
section
315
in
1959
to
provide
that
appearances
on
a
bonafide
newscast,
a
bonafide
news
interview,
a
bonafide
news
documentary,
and
on
the
spot
coverage
of
bonafide
news
events
need
not
be
taken
into
account
in
determining
the
long
established
congressional
mandate,
and
expression
i
believe
of
the
notion
of
the
fairness
doctrine
of
equal
time
for
political
candidates.
and
then,
it
is
very
significant
i
think
that
as
a
part
of
that
amendment,
congress
enacted
these
words,
“nothing
in
the
foregoing
sentence,"
that
is
the
exception
of
bonafide
new
broadcast,
"nothing
in
the
foregoing
sentence
shall
be
construed
as
relieving
broadcasters
in
connection
with
the
presentation
of
newscast,
news
interviews,
news
documentaries
and
on
the
spot
coverage
of
news
events
from
the
obligation
imposed
upon
them
under
this
chapter
to
operate
in
the
public
interest
and
to
afford
reasonable
opportunity
for
the
discussion
of
conflicting
views
on
issues
of
public
importance.”
and
the
statute
also
provided
in
paragraph
c,
the
commission
shall
prescribe
appropriate
rules
and
regulations
to
carry
out
the
provisions
of
this
section.
since
our
brief
was
filed,
i
came
across
another
related
matter.
in
1960,
congress
suspended
the
equal
time
provision
for
the
1960
presidential
campaign
only,
and
in
that
statute
which
was
a
temporary
statute
and
therefore
isn't
included
in
the
u.s.
code,
there
was
this
additional
sentence,
nothing
in
the
foregoing
shall
be
construed
as
relieving
broadcasters
from
the
obligation
imposed
upon
them
under
this
act
to
operate
in
the
public
interests.
now,
as
merely
accumulative,
it
adds
nothing
to
the
provision
that
isn't
section
315,
but
it
does
show
the
continuing
concern
of
congress
to
maintain
the
requirement
of
operation
in
the
public
interest
not
as
a
mere
private
venture,
which
is
the
heart
of
the
fairness
doctrine.
finally,
some
four
years
later,
the
commission
put
out
a
report
which
is
called
the
fairness
premier.
as
it
appears
in
the
federal
register,
it
looks
like
this.
it
is
in
essence,
a
digest
of
the
decisions
which
the
commission
had
reached
in
this
area
followed
by
two
appendices
which
are
reports
of
the
commission
and
one
of
them
is
a
report
of
the
commission
on
editorializing
by
broadcast
licensees.
the
other
is
a
rather
full
and
comprehensive
history
of
the
fairness
doctrine.
and
putting
this
out,
the
commission
said,
“it
is
the
purpose
of
this
public
notice
to
advice
broadcast
licensees
and
members
of
the
public
of
the
rights,
obligations,
and
responsibilities
of
such
licensees
under
the
commission's
fairness
doctrine,
which
is
applicable
in
any
case
in
which
broadcast
facilities
are
used
for
the
discussion
of
a
controversial
issue
of
public
importance.
now,
there
is
included
in
the
fairness
premier,
digest
of
several
cases
which
involved
personal
attacks.
and
that
is
the
source,
not
the
chronological
origin
but
the
place
where
there
is
contained
and
in
official
publication,
the
then
statement
of
the
commission's
views
with
respect
to
the
particular
application
of
the
fairness
doctrine
which
has
come
to
be
known
as
the
personal
attack
doctrine.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
1964
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
july
25,
1964.
i
believe
it's
been
put
out
in
a
different
format
as
a
pamphlet,
but
this
is
the
way
in
which
it
appeared
in
the
federal
register
for
july
25,
1964.
mr.
robb
has
stated
the
facts
of
the
red
lion
case
accurately,
and
i
have
no
supplement
to
make
the
red
lion
station
did
broadcast
a
personal
attack
on
mr.
cook.
mr.
cook
sought
an
opportunity
to
reply.
he
was
told
he
could
have
it
if
he
would
pay
for
it
or
if
he
would
certify
that
he
was
unable
to
pay
for
it.
mr.
cook
then
wrote
to
the
commission
and
there
was
an
exchange
of
letters
between
the
station
and
the
commission.
but
the
first
question
that
arises
in
my
mind
on
this
is
whether
the
case
is
really
properly
before
the
courts.
now,
what
is
the
order
here?
in
the
record,
one
will
find
two
letters.
one,
incidentally,
they
both
appear
at
least
twice
in
the
record.
the
letter
of
october
6,
1965
appears
on
page
9
and
also
on
page
37.
that
letter
ends
"accordingly,
you
are
requested
to
advice
the
commission
of
your
plans
to
comply
with
the
fairness
doctrine
applicable
to
the
situation."
the
station
then
wrote
back
to
the
commission
and
on
december
9th,
the
commission
wrote
a
rather
long
letter
discussing
the
legal
questions,
and
i
have
the
greatest
difficulty
finding
that
there
was
any
order
of
any
kind
in
there.
there
may
have
been
some
indication
that
if
the
station
didn't
comply
with
this
that
when
the
time
came
for
their
license
to
be
renewed,
this
would
be
a
factor
to
be
taken
into
account,
but
there
was
no
order
within
any
understanding
that
i
have
had
with
respect
to
the
reviewability
of
administrative
orders.
indeed,
the
court
of
appeals
panel
first
held
that
there
was
nothing
reviewable
here,
but
this
was
overturned
by
the
court
of
appeals
en
banc
without
any
opinion.
and
i
would
point
out
that
this
was
in
march
1967,
a
few
months
before
this
court's
decision
in
the
abbott
laboratories
case,
but
i
would
mention
in
connection
with
that
particularly
before
this
court's
decision
in
the
toilet
goods
association
against
gardner
which
was
decided
at
the
same
time.
and
it's
very
hard
for
me
to
see
that
this
is
a
sort
of
order
that
should
be
reviewed.
let
me
simply
interject
here
that
after
the
fairness
premier
was
put
out,
the
commission
did
have
a
formal
rule
making
proceeding
and
did
make
rules
on
personal
attack
and
political
editorializing.
those
rules
are
not
involved
in
this
case
but
they
are
the
subject
matter
of
the
next
case,
number
717.
in
their
brief
in
the
next
case,
a
counsel
for
their
radio
television
news
directors
association
say
quote,
“new
york
times
v.
sullivan
governs
this
case”,
just
as
simple
as
that.
if
the
new
york
times
case
governs
that
case,
i
suppose
it
governs
this
one
as
well.
so,
i
would
like
to
start
with
a
consideration
of
the
new
york
times
case
and
the
differences
between
the
problem
there
and
here.
the
new
york
times
case
was
a
newspaper
case,
a
press
case
in
the
literal
sense.
now,
we
do
not
have
a
federal
press
commission.
we
do
have
a
federal
communications
commission.
we
do
not
license
newspapers,
nor
other
elements
of
the
printed
media.
we
do
license
radio
and
television
stations.
it
is
inconceivable
that
we
would
undertake
to
enjoin
a
newspaper
from
publishing.
we
can
and
would
enjoin
a
radio
or
television
station
from
operating
if
it
did
not
have
a
license
from
the
federal
communications
commission.
so,
there
must
be
some
difference.
it
obviously
lies
in
the
fact
that
radio
and
television
exercise
a
privilege
which
is
not
utilized
by
the
printed
press.
radio
and
television
use
a
portion
of
the
public
domain.
they
have
and
require
exclusive
use
of
a
portion
of
the
radio
spectrum.
without
their
license,
they
would
not
be
entitled
to
use
it.
with
their
license,
they
are
entitled
to
use
it
to
the
exclusion
of
everyone
else.
they
not
only
have
a
grant
of
a
portion
of
the
public
domain,
they
have
a
considerable
measure
of
protection
from
competition.
in
many
communities,
there
is
only
one
radio
station
or
one
television
station.
even
when
there
are
more
as
in
the
big
cities,
the
protection
from
competition
is
substantial.
as
its
evidence
indeed
by
the
prices
in
the
tens
of
millions
of
dollars
which
are
paid
for
a
radio
and
television
stations.
there
can
only
be
a
limited
number
of
very
high
frequency
television
stations
and
uhf
or
ultra
high
frequency
is
not
yet
very
effective
in
competition,
and
similarly,
the
number
of
am
radio
stations
is
limited.
does
the
fact
that
radio
and
television
can
operate
only
when
they
are
privilege
to
use
a
limited
public
facility
mean
that
they
are
outside
the
protection
of
the
first
amendment?
of
course,
that
is
not
our
position.
we
are
all
guardians
of
the
first
amendment,
government
as
well
as
broadcasters.
the
question
to
be
determined
is
the
application
of
the
amendment
in
this
particular
situation.
there
is
a
great
effort
here
and
in
the
following
case
to
put
us
in
the
position
of
attacking
the
first
amendment
and
seeking
to
rescript
--
restricted
scope.
we
do
not
accept
such
a
position.
we
rely
on
the
first
amendment
and
contend
that
our
position
is
the
one
that
makes
it
effective
as
against
the
narrow
and
i
may
say
selfish
interest
of
the
broadcasters.
the
personal
attack
rules
do
not
forbid
anything.
the
broadcaster
can
still
put
on
whatever
he
wants
to
put
on.
the
personal
attack
rules
do
not
control
the
response.
they
merely
provide
that
there
must
be
an
opportunity
for
response.
in
order
that
the
listener
may
have
the
benefit
of
robust
debate
as
a
consequence
of
the
publicly
owned
radio
spectrum
being
used
in
the
public
interest,
not
merely
as
the
exclusive
private
fee
of
the
broadcaster.
in
one
of
the
briefs
in
the
next
case,
professor
harry
calvin
is
quoted.
in
this
article,
professor
calvin
says
quote,
“think
of
a
town
meeting
where
the
chair
would
rule
that
each
speaker
must
be
fair
to
both
sides.”
end
of
the
quotation.
and
now,
i
like
the
town
meeting
analogy.
i've
taken
part
in
a
good
many
of
them
and
they
are
remarkable
example
of
democracy
in
action.
but
i
think
that
professor
calvin
has
misapplied
the
analogy.
he
has
misapprehended
the
function
and
the
opportunity
and
the
responsibility
of
the
moderator.
let
me
put
it
this
way.
think
of
a
town
meeting
where
the
moderator
did
not
see
to
it
that
both
sides
have
full
and
fair
and
equal
opportunity
to
speak.
can
you
imagine
a
moderator,
who
after
one
side
have
spoken
in
strong
and
fighting
attack
would
then
tell
the
opposition
speaker,
"no,
you
can't
speak
here.
perhaps
you
can
get
a
hearing
in
some
other
town
but
not
here.
he
would
not
last
long
as
a
moderator.
the
very
essence
of
his
post
is
to
run
the
meeting
in
a
fair
manner;
giving
all
relevant
viewpoints
or
reasonable
opportunity
to
be
heard.
he
does
not
control
one
side
or
the
other.
he
does
not
censor.
he
does
not
force
anyone
to
speak.
and
when
someone
wants
to
speak,
he
does
not
tel
him
what
to
say.
he
keeps
the
channels
of
communication
open.
he
assures
full
debate
as
robust
as
the
citizens
want
to
make
it.
he
sets
the
ground
rules,
but
he
does
not
control
or
take
part
or
censor.
is
this
not
a
good
analogy
for
the
present
case?
it
is
the
commission
which
is
in
the
position
of
the
moderator.
the
commission
does
not
control
or
take
part
or
forbid
or
censor,
but
it
does
represent
the
public
interest
in
assuring
that
the
public
facility
is
used
for
the
public
benefit.
the
personal
attack
rules
do
not
rest
on
protection
for
the
person
attacked,
they
are
for
the
benefit
of
the
public.
as
a
part
of
the
overall
fairness
doctrine
which
is
designed
to
make
the
first
amendment
effective
and
which
derives
directly
from
the
public
ownership
of
the
radio
spectrum
and
the
enactment
of
congress
that
radio
and
television
stations
must
operate
for
the
public
interest,
convenience
and
necessity.
this
leads
directly
to
the
next
portion
of
the
argument.
it
is
said
that
application
of
the
personal
attack
rules
will
inhibit
radio
and
television
operators.
and
that
they
will
prefer
not
to
put
on
controversial
programs
because
they
will
lose
money
if
time
has
to
be
made
available
for
a
reply.
this,
it
seems
to
me
begs
the
question.
as
in
many
legal
arguments,
we
are
in
this
case
i
think
very
much
at
the
risk
of
the
tyranny
of
labels.
i've
already
referred
to
one
aspect
to
this
which
might
be
put
in
the
syllogism,
major
premise,
the
press
cannot
be
required
to
adhere
to
a
fairness
rule,
minor
premise,
radio
and
television
are
part
of
the
press
conclusion.
and
therefore,
radio
and
television
cannot
be
subjected
to
the
fairness
rule.
as
i've
argued,
the
label
is
not
applicable.
and
now
on
this
point,
we're
subjected
to
the
pressure
of
another
label.
it
is
said
that
freedom
of
the
press
cannot
be
inhibited.
it
would
be
inhibited
if
there
were
a
personal
attack
rule.
therefore,
the
personal
attack
rule
must
fall
under
the
first
amendment.
this
i
submit
is
in
part
pure
assertion
and
in
remaining
part
false
reasoning.
there
is
no
evidence
whatever
in
this
record
that
the
red
lion
station
was
or
would
inhibited
by
the
application
of
the
personal
attack
doctrine.
in
this
very
case,
it
went
ahead
and
broadcast
the
attack
after
the
commission
had
published
the
fairness
premier
in
1964
and
it
knew
just
what
was
expected
of
it
by
the
commission.
but
beyond
that
as
i've
said,
the
argument
is
based
on
faulty
analysis
for
it
assumes
that
every
minute
of
the
time
available
to
a
broadcast
licensee
is
his
to
use
as
he
sees
fit
for
his
own
personal
financial
profit.
but
he
isn't
remains
a
licensee.
he
is
using
a
public
facility.
his
license
expressly
provides
that
it
must
be
used
for
the
public
convenience
and
interest.
if
he
does
not
meet
the
standard
of
the
public
interest,
the
commission
may
fail
to
renew
his
license,
it
can
even
cancel
it.
and
i
will
continue
tomorrow.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
before
resuming
my
argument,
i
would
like
to
make
a
reference
to
one
matter
to
which
i
referred
yesterday
afternoon.
i
raised
question
as
to
whether
there
was
something
in
this
exchange
of
letters
between
the
commission
and
the
red
lion
broadcasting
which
constituted
and
ordered,
which
was
properly
subject
for
judicial
review.
i
should
point
out
that
the
question
whether
there
was
something
reviewable
there
was
presented
by
petition
for
rehearing
en
banc
by
the
government,
which
was
joined
in
by
the
other
side
and
that
my
reference
there
should
be
simply
my
own
personal
puzzlement
as
to
what
in
these
days
constitutes
a
proper
subject
of
judicial
review.
at
the
conclusion
of
the
argument
yesterday
afternoon,
i
was
referring
to
the
suggestion
that
the
personal
attack
regulations
would
inhibit
actions
by
broadcasters.
the
inhibition
i've
suggested
lies
--
the
suggestion
of
inhibition
i
contended,
lies
in
a
misapprehension
of
the
status
of
the
broadcaster.
it
based
on
the
assumption
that
every
minute
of
the
time
available
to
a
broadcast
licensee
is
his
to
use
for
his
own
personal
financial
profit.
and
i
was
arguing
that
his
license
allows
him
to
use
a
public
facility.
it
provides
that
it
must
be
used
for
the
public
convenience
and
interest.
if
he
doesn't
meet
the
standard
of
the
public
interest,
the
commission
may
fail
to
renew
his
license,
it
can
even
cancel
it.
and
certainly,
the
personal
attack
doctrine
as
an
aspect
of
the
fairness
doctrine
does
no
more
than
to
say
that
he
must
use
his
privilege
in
this
particular
circumstance
in
the
public
interest.
his
license
comes
to
him
burdened
with
a
public
obligation,
and
he
is
in
no
position
to
claim
that
he
is
inhibited
if
he
is
required
to
make
a
modest
performance
on
the
obligation.
experience
shows
that
there
is
little
trouble
under
the
fairness
and
personal
attack
doctrines
with
the
great
networks
and
the
stations
which
they
control.
the
problem
arises
mostly
with
the
small
independent
stations
as
in
the
present
case.
as
i've
already
indicated,
there's
no
evidence
here,
no
showing
of
any
hardship,
or
even
of
lost
of
revenue
by
the
station.
mr.
robb
in
his
argument
yesterday
admitted
that
there
was
a
personal
attack,
so,
there
is
no
question
here
about
the
suggested
vagueness
of
the
regulation.
the
only
objection
that
the
station
made
was
to
the
granting
of
free
time.
they
made
no
suggestion
as
to
a
problem
of
scheduling.
moreover,
as
has
been
indicated,
they
had
a
format.
they
had
a
free
speech
hour
each
week
when
they
could
readily
have
putted
in.
indeed,
many
small
stations
play
a
great
deal
of
music
and
an
appropriate
response
to
a
personal
attack
could
have
been
put
on
the
air
in
place
of
a
single
recording.
the
commission
does
not
undertake
to
tell
the
station
just
where
the
response
must
be
put
as
long
as
the
station
chose
an
effort
to
be
fair.
the
placing
of
the
response
is
up
to
it.
if
it
can
get
a
sponsor,
it's
free
to
do
so.
otherwise,
it
must
be
on
sustaining
time.
but
as
i've
indicated,
that
is
part
of
the
obligation.
it
undertakes
when
it
accepts
its
license.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
let
me
say
in
response
to
that
mr.
justice
that
the
fairness
premier
had
been
published
before
this.
the
fairness
premier
is
essentially
a
digest
of
previous
rulings
of
the
commission.
i
think
i'm
right
in
my
recollection
that
at
least
one
of
those
rulings
involved
the
question
of
free
time.
it
was
not
as
explicit
as
it
was
in
this
exchange
of
letters,
but
i
think
it
is
inherent
in
the
fairness
doctrine.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
there
were
a
165
to
broadcast
this
program.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
simple
offer
of
time.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
time
if
you
wanted
to
pay
for
it.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
but
let
me
suggest
to
you
mr.
justice
that
paying
for
time
on
a
165
stations
is
pretty
substantial
burden
to
put
on
the
person
involved
here,
particularly
when
as
this
our
submission,
this
is
really
the
obligation
of
the
station
in
meeting
the
statutory
requirement
of
operating
in
the
public
interest
which
over
the
course
of
a
long
evolution
has
developed
into
the
fairness
doctrine
and
more
specifically
into
the
personal
attack
doctrine.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
not
as
clear
as
i
would
like
to
have
it
to
be.
there
was
no
--
nothing
stated
in
bold
face
type
that
you
must
do
this
on
free
time
if
you
can't
get
a
sponsor.
i
think
it
was
understood
and
i
don't
think
that
red
lion
was
surprised
when
the
response
came
from
the
commission.
certainly,
that
is
a
part
of
the
issue
here.
i
think
it
would
be
unfortunate
in
the
long
run
to
have
it
said
that
"well,
you
can
reply
if
you
can
pay
for
it,
or
you
can
reply
if
you
can
get
sponsor,"
that
would
seem
to
be
a
considerable
hindrance
on
a
free
speech
and
the
development
of
a
robust
debate
which
is
the
underlying
objective
of
the
first
amendment.
it
is
our
position
that
the
objective
of
the
fairness
premier
of
the
commission's
action
here
is
to
implement
the
first
amendment,
not
to
subvert
it.
to
induce
the
licensees
to
recognize
their
obligation
under
the
amendments
since
they
are
utilizing
a
portion
of
a
public
facility,
it
has
been
argued
that
the
first
amendment
requires
an
opportunity
for
response
in
a
situation
like
this,
that
in
effect
the
united
states
would
be
denying
free
speech
if
there
were
no
personal
attack
doctrine.
i
don't
go
that
far,
but
i
do
contend
that
the
regulation
here
involved
on
these
facts
does
implement
the
first
amendment,
does
protect
the
public's
right
to
hear
which
is
the
underlying
basis
of
the
first
amendment,
and
tends
towards
encouraging
robust
in
spirited
debate
in
accordance
with
the
thrust
and
objective
of
the
first
amendment.
and
for
these
reasons,
we
would
submit
that
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i'm
referring
for
a
moment
to
the
previous
case
in
mr.
justice
stewart's
question.
i
would
call
attention
to
ruling
number
17
in
the
fairness
primer
which
deals
specifically
with
the
question
of
paid
sponsorship
and
advices
the
stations
through
recounting
the
ruling
in
a
case
of
the
cullman
broadcasting
company
and
says
that
it
is
not
sufficient
if
you
simply
offer
sponsored
time.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
fairness
primer
was
published
july
1,
1964
and
not
only
was
published
in
the
federal
register
but
it
appears
in
the
record
that
it
was
distributed
to
each
broadcasting
facility
in
the
country.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
hargis
--
it
was
in
1965.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
following
--
following
this
event.
now
turning
to
number
717,
the
radio
television
and
news
directors
association
case
which
there
are
a
considerable
number
of
other
respondents,
a
number
of
whom
have
filed
briefs,
i
think
i
might
say
at
this
point
that
i
take
at
certain
satisfaction
from
the
fact
that
in
this
case,
the
american
civil
liberties
union
is
on
my
side
and
also
the
united
church
of
christ
has
filed
a
brief
amicus
curiae
which
is
a
very
excellent
brief.
if
the
court
should
find
our
brief
too
long,
i
would
hope
they
would
read
that
because
it
is
a
very
fine
presentation
of
our
position.
this
case
is
the
sequel
to
the
one
just
argued
but
it's
quite
different.
it
fits
in
chronologically
but
it
comes
with
a
very
different
setting.
there
are
no
facts
in
this
case
but
there
is
a
formal
regulation
which
is
attacked
with
a
widely
scattering
shotgun.
the
federal
communications
commission
wrote
its
final
red
lion
letter
on
december
10,
1965.
shortly
thereafter,
on
april
6,
1966,
the
commission
issued
a
notice
of
proposed
rulemaking
complying
fully
with
all
of
the
requirements
of
the
administrative
procedure
act.
this
indicated
the
commission's
purpose
to
adopt
rules
with
respect
to
two
matters,
personal
attacks
and
political
editorials.
the
text
to
the
proposed
rule
was
set
forth
and
in
accordance
with
the
administrative
procedure
act
comments
were
invited
and
many
were
received.
and
the
comments
however
took
the
form
of
arguments.
there
were
some
reputations
or
some
representations
but
nothing
in
the
form
of
evidence
was
presented.
there
were
no
affidavits
or
depositions.
nor
was
any
testimony
of
witnesses
offered
or
invited
at
the
hearing.
that
isn't
the
practice
with
respect
to
hearings
on
a
proposed
rulemaking.
more
than
a
year
later,
on
july
5,
1967
and
in
that
connection
with
respect
to
findings,
i
would
like
to
call
attention
to
justice
brandeis
in
pacific
states
company
against
white.
there
is
a
lot
of
talk
in
this
case
to
the
effect
that
the
commission
didn't
make
findings
to
support
its
regulation.
but
justice
brandeis
in
that
well-known
case
said
here,
"there
is
added
reason
for
applying
the
presumption
of
validity
for
the
regulation
now
challenged
was
adapted
after
notice
and
public
hearing
as
the
statute
required.
it
is
contended
that
the
order
is
void
because
the
administrative
body
made
no
special
findings
of
fact
but
the
statute
did
not
require
special
findings
doubtless
because
the
regulation
authorized
with
general
legislation,
not
an
administrative
order
and
the
nature
of
a
judgment
directed
against
an
individual
concern.”
in
1967,
the
commission
formally
adopted
the
rules
which
had
had
proposed
with
only
slight
changes.
in
doing
so,
the
commission
issued
a
statement
saying
that
it
was
simply
a
codification
intended
to
clarify
a
portion
of
the
obligation
under
the
fairness
doctrine
which
as
i
have
indicated
in
the
previous
case
finds
its
origin
more
than
40
years
ago
and
has
been
slowly
developing
over
all
of
the
intervening
years
with
the
equal
time
provision
and
the
statute
going
back
to
1927
as
the
first
exemplification
of
it.
we
think
it
finds
specific
statutory
recognition
in
the
amendment
which
congress
adopted
to
section
315
in
1959
as
well
as
in
section
315
itself
which
is
the
equal
time
provision
which
after
all
is
simply
a
specification
of
one
application
of
the
general
fairness
concept
which
is
implicit
in
the
very
fact
of
federal
regulation
of
radio
communications.
the
regulation
which
the
commission
adopted
in
1967
has
been
twice
amended
at
both
times
to
narrow
it,
both
times
i
think
an
exercise
of
care
and
caution
by
the
commission.
on
august
7,
1967,
it
was
amended
to
exempt
bona
fide
newscast
and
on
the
spot
coverage
of
bona
fide
news
events
and
then
after
review
was
sought
in
the
court
of
appeals.
it
was
amended
again,
this
time
to
exempt
bona
fide
news
interviews
and
commentary
or
analysis
in
the
course
of
bona
fide
newscast.
the
regulation
as
finally
amended
is
set
out
on
pages
7
and
8,
the
very
last
line
on
page
6
but
on
page
7
and
8,
of
the
government's
brief
and
i
think
it
is
desirable
to
put
its
term
before
the
court
by
reading.
it
starts
with
the
heading
personal
attacks,
political
editorials.
when
during
the
presentation
of
views
on
a
controversial
issue
of
public
importance
and
attack
is
made
upon
the
honesty,
character,
integrity,
or
like
personal
qualities
of
an
identified
person
or
group,
the
licensee
shall
within
a
reasonable
time
and
in
no
event
later
than
one
week
after
the
attack
transmit
to
the
person
or
group
attacked;
(1)
notification
of
the
date
and
time
and
identification
of
the
broadcast;
(2)
a
script
or
tape
or
an
accurate
summary
of
this
or
if
a
script
or
tape
is
not
available
of
the
attack;
and
(3)
an
offer
of
a
reasonable
opportunity
to
respond
over
licensees
facilities.
(b)
the
provision
of
this
paragraph
(a)
--
of
paragraph
(a)
of
this
station
shall
not
be
applicable;
(1)
to
attacks
on
foreign
groups
or
foreign
public
figures;
(2)
to
personal
attacks
which
are
made
by
legally
qualified
candidates,
their
authorized
spokesman
or
those
associated
with
them
in
the
campaign
on
other
such
candidates,
their
authorized
spokesman
or
persons
associated
with
the
candidates
in
the
campaign
and
(3)
to
bona

interviews
and
on
the
spot
coverage
of
a
bona
fide
news
event
including
commentary
or
analysis
contained
in
the
foregoing
programs
but
the
provisions
of
paragraph
(a)
shall
be
applicable
to
editorials
of
the
licensee.
and
then
there
is
a
note,
the
fairness
doctrine
is
applicable
to
situations
coming
within
three
above
and
then
a
specific
factual
situation
may
be
applicable
in
the
general
area
of
political
broadcast.
and
then
paragraph
(c)
where
--
paragraph
(c)
turns
to
a
new
topic,
a
personal
attack
is
close
now.
this
is
the
editorializing
portion
of
the
regulation
where
a
licensee,
in
an
editorial,
(i)
endorses
or
(ii)
opposes
a
legally
qualified
candidate
or
candidates,
the
licensee
shall,
within
24
hours
after
the
editorial,
transmit
to
respectively
(i)
the
other
qualified
candidate
or
candidates
for
the
same
office
or
(ii)
the
candidate
opposed
in
the
editorial
(1)
notification
of
the
date
and
the
time
of
the
editorial;
(2)
a
script
or
tape
of
the
editorial;
and
(3)
an
offer
of
a
reasonable
opportunity
for
a
candidate
or
a
spokesman
of
the
candidate
to
respond
over
the
licensee's
facilities.
provided,
however,
that
where
such
editorials
are
broadcast
within
72
hours
prior
to
the
day
of
the
election,
the
licensee
shall
comply
with
the
provisions
of
this
subsection
sufficiently
far
in
advance
of
the
broadcast
to
enable
the
candidate
or
candidates
to
have
a
reasonable
opportunity
to
prepare
a
response
and
to
present
it
in
a
timely
fashion.
now,
i
think
that
that
shows
that
the
commission
used
a
great
care
in
formulating
the
regulation
and
making
its
requirements
clear
to
the
broadcasters
who
are
involved.
before
i
leave
the
question
of
the
text
to
the
regulations,
i
should
refer
to
one
other
matter
when
the
final
amendment
of
the
regulation
was
issued
there
was
also
an
accompanying
memorandum
and
this
is
set
out
at
page
228
of
volume
1
on
the
appendix.
both
the
radio
news
--
radio
television
news
directors
association,
i
never
can
keep
those
initials
straight
rtnda,
and
the
columbia
broadcasting
system
make
much
in
their
briefs,
subparagraph
5
of
this
memorandum
which
is
set
out
beginning
on
page
232
and
it
is
repeatedly
said
in
particularly
in
the
columbia
broadcasting
brief
that
though
the
commission
in
its
regulation
exempted
those
several
categories
of
news
broadcast,
bona
fide
newscast,
bona
fide
news
interviews,
and
on
the
spot
coverage
of
a
bona
fide
news
event
including
commentary
or
analysis
contained
in
the
foregoing
programs
that
they
took
it
all
back
by
paragraph
5
of
this
memorandum.
and
i
suggest
without
reading
paragraph
5
now,
that
what
paragraph
5
does
is
simply
to
remind
the
stations
that
everything
they
do
is
subject
to
the
fairness
doctrine
and
even
though
these
items
in
the
news
programs
are
exempted
that
if
overall
they
have
done
a
job
which
is
not
in
the
public
interest,
that
is
a
matter
which
is
relevant
in
consideration
with
the
regulation
of
the
stations.
we
think
that
the
suggestion
in
the
columbia
broadcasting
brief
that
this
takes
back
everything
is
not
an
accurate
summary
of
it.
all
that
paragraph
5
does
is
to
say
that
the
news
programs
like
everything
else
the
broadcaster
does
remains
subject
to
the
fairness
doctrine
which
is
inherent
in
the
very
concept
of
public
regulation
of
broadcasting
and
is
implicit
in
the
grant
of
a
temporary
license
to
a
broadcaster
on
the
basis
of
public
convenience,
interest
and
necessity.
so
we
have
the
rules
which
were
adopted
by
the
commission
in
1967
with
the
two
later
modifications.
without
anything
more,
the
respondents
here
filed
petitions
for
review
of
the
orders
of
the
commission,
some
of
these
were
filed
in
the
seventh
circuit,
others
in
the
second
but
they
were
all
consolidated
by
transfer
in
the
seventh
circuit
and
that
is
the
one
decision
which
is
before
the
court.
for
a
record,
the
parties
filed
the
comments
which
have
been
filed
before
the
commission
and
the
orders
and
memoranda
of
the
commission.
there
is
a
second
volume
of
the
appendix,
appendix
volume
2
which
counsel
on
the
other
side
assures
is
a
part
of
the
record
but
i
wonder.
it
is
at
least
an
odd
sort
of
record.
it
consists
of
factual
material
not
otherwise
in
the
record
which
was
included
in
the
brief
which
was
filed
before
the
court
of
appeals.
there
was
a
motion
for
leave
to
file
this
brief
as
an
exhibit
and
this
motion
was
granted
by
a
judge
of
the
court.
i
don't
suppose
that
makes
it
a
part
of
the
record.
and
then
there
was
insistence
that
we
include
it
in
the
record
here
and
we
did
not
think
it
worth
making
an
issue
of
it.
whatever
this
material
is,
i
would
point
out
that
it
was
never
submitted
to
the
commission.
the
commission
did
not
have
the
benefit
of
whatever
value
it
may
have.
in
any
event,
almost
without
exception,
it
is
irrelevant
here
for
the
several
broadcast
recounted
would
all
or
nearly
all
be
accepted
from
the
personal
attack
rules
by
the
exceptions
which
the
commission
has
included
in
those
rules
in
an
effort
to
be
sure
that
the
burden
on
broadcasters
and
the
spontaneity
of
their
handling
of
news
programs
and
commentary
should
be
as
great
as
possible.
and
i
would
mention
too
that
the
footnotes
in
the
several
briefs
contain
references
to
program
which
have
appeared
since
the
rules
were
promulgated
and
with
no
indication
that
the
rules
are
applicable
to
this
or
that
anyone
is
seeking
to
apply
the
rules
to
them.
now,
the
whole
proceeding
puzzles
me,
no
one
has
yet
been
ordered
to
do
anything.
no
penalties
or
forfeitures
have
been
imposed.
there
are
no
specific
concrete
facts
before
the
court.
the
facts
just
float
around
and
this
morning
about
five
minutes
before
the
argument,
i
was
handed
a
transcript
of
a
broadcast
of
january
28,
1969
and
told
that
it
would
be
referred
to
in
the
argument.
i
haven't
had
a
chance
to
read
it.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
mr.
justice,
it
is
perfectly
plain
that
almost
without
exception,
nothing
in
the
appendix
is
subject
to
the
rules.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
would
like
to
know
the
facts
of
a
concrete
specific
case.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
but
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
they
don't
contend
now
mr.
justice
that
these
things
would
be
covered
by
the
present
rule.
this
is
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
sevareid
broadcast
would
not
be
covered
by
other
rule
if
they
were
included
in
a
bona
fide
news
program
as
most
of
them
are.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
--
this
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
sevareid
interview
programs
would
be
covered
and
the
one
that
was
handed
to
me
this
morning
is
a
sevareid
interview
program.
but
even
there,
i
would
like
to
know
what
the
commission
does
about
it.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
yes,
of
course
mr.
justice.
the
extent
of
the
burden
would
be
a
matter
for
consideration.
i
think
we
ought
to
have
facts
about
that
and
i
think
we
ought
to
know
what
the
types
of
programs
are.
what
the
nature
of
the
response
required
is,
what
the
burden
is
of
meeting
it.
we
have
nothing
of
that
sort
here.
the
thing
that
gives
me
great
concern
about
the
way
this
case
has
come
up
is
that
it
makes
this
great
rule.
this
bona
fide
effort
to
deal
with
the
problem
that
people
have
been
wrestling
with
for
40
years,
it
makes
us
subject
to
a
parade
of
horribles.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
they
are
entitled
to
do
a
good
deal
more
than
they
used
to
be
entitled
to.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
still
seems
to
me
that
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
this
is
a
nice
example
of
the
reason
why
in
cases
of
this
type
and
i
repeat,
i
think
this
is
rather
different
from
abbott
laboratories
which
is
a
pretty
narrow
specific
thing
in
cases
of
this
type,
where
the
validity
of
a
regulation
should
not
be
determined
in
vacuo,
should
not
be
determined
with
respect
to
any
conceivable
facts
which
is
in
effect
what
is
sought
to
be
done
by
this
and
by
bringing
in
the
january
sevareid
broadcast
but
should
be
determined
on
the
basis
of
specific
facts.
we
ought
not
to
have
to
consider
the
validity
of
this
regulation
in
terms
of
the
worst
that
can
happen
but
rather
in
terms
of
what
does
happen
in
a
particular
case.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
oh!
yes,
mr.
justice.
i
think
it's
an
element
that
even
so
i
would
like
to
have
that
developed
in
terms
of
specific
fact
that
at
the
very
least
it
seems
to
me
that
a
rule
of
this
start
shouldn't
be
simply
stricken
down
as
the
seventh
circuit
did
without
any
specific
facts
and
simply
because
the
fears
that
can
be
arouse
by
the
--
a
parade
of
the
most
difficult
cases
makes
it
apparent
that
there
are
serious
problems
here.
this
is
an
area
in
which
thoughtful
people
have
been
groping
for
answers
for
nearly
40
years
with
some
slow
but
steady
growth
and
development
over
that
period.
first,
it
was
very
general
of
the
fairness
doctrine.
then
it
was
spelled
out
in
more
detail
in
the
fairness
primer
which
is
involved
in
the
red
lion
case.
now,
the
commission
has
thought
it
wise
put
it
into
a
formal
rule.
not
because
it's
cracking
the
whip
but
because
that
is
good
administration.
that
is
the
way
to
let
the
broadcasters
know
just
what
the
commission
understands
their
responsibilities
to
be.
and
i
repeat
they
have
responsibilities
which
they
do
not
always
seem
to
recognize
in
their
briefs.
it
may
be
that
experience
in
concrete
cases
will
show
that
the
rule
needs
to
be
modified
in
this
detail
or
that.
the
lines
have
been
narrowed
but
the
commission
is
still
active
and
alert.
it
will
watch
the
situation
and
will
administer
the
rule
with
care
and
with
skill
based
on
its
experience
and
with
its
devotion
to
the
public
interest.
if
in
some
particular
case
the
commission
reaches
a
conclusion
that
goes
too
far,
there
will
always
be
opportunity
for
judicial
review
of
that
case
based
on
those
facts
and
with
the
commission
specific
ruling
on
those
facts
before
the
court.
this
is
not
our
petition
for
review.
we
do
not
seek
a
declaratory
judgment
that
this
rule
is
good
no
matter
what
but
equally
we
do
not
think
that
it
should
be
held
bad
no
matter
what,
without
any
specific
facts
and
without
any
ruling
or
interpretation
of
the
rule
by
the
commission
based
on
those
facts.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
should
not
be
judged
as
to
it's
--?
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
on
its
face.
yes,
i
think
that
is
true
mr.
justice.
i
think
that
this
is
peculiarly
the
kind
of
a
rule
and
a
situation
where
--
obviously,
is
not
careless
or
thoughtless
or
arbitrary.
it
is
obviously
been
carefully
formulated
and
where
its
validity
should
be
determined
in
terms
of
what
actually
happens
under
it
rather
than
in
terms
of
what
somebody
might
suppose
could
happen
taking
the
worst
possible
circumstances
which
come
up.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
that's
the
nature
of
the
issue
and
if
that
were
the
way
the
rule
operated,
it
would
certainly
be
a
serious
matter.
our
position
is
just
to
the
contrary
that
what
the
rule
does
is
to
promote
to
the
opportunity
of
the
public
to
hear
all
sides
and
to
have
a
vigorous,
robust
debate
which
they
will
not
have
if
the
station
can
put
out
personal
attacks
and
then
shut
up
and
then
say,
"no,
you
can't
do
anything
about
it
whether
you
pay
or
not.”
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice
that's
--
that
is
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
has
been
the
experience
under
the
fairness
doctrine.
it
has
been
the
experience
under
the
fairness
primer
with
the
only
minor
number
of
problems.
i
can't
say
that
we
really
have
any
experience
under
the
rules
because
among
other
things
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
was
the
commission's
prediction,
hope
and
expectation.
and
i
think
that
experience
over
a
long
period
shows
that
at
least
the
major
broadcasters
are
energetic,
debate
and
discussion
as
a
part
of
what
helps
them
in
the
competition
situation
and
i
find
it
difficult
to
think
that
this
rule
should
not
have
a
chance
to
show
that
it
can
promote
public
discussion
and
understanding
merely
because
in
some
special
circumstances
it
is
thought
that
it
may
present
some
problems.
this
is
not
the
first
time
that
the
broadcasting
industry
has
raised
great
threats
i
referred
already
to
the
brief
filed
by
the
office
of
communication
of
the
united
church
of
christ
and
in
the
appendix
to
that
brief,
there
is
set
out
the
introduction
to
a
pamphlet
which
was
put
out
by
the
columbia
broadcasting
system
at
the
time
the
chain
broadcasting
rules
were
before
the
court
and
they
then
put
in
the
strongest
terms
that
if
the
chain
broadcasting
rules
were
adopted,
the
public
would
lose
all
the
benefits
of
radio
and
so
on
and
it's
perfectly
plain
that
since
those
rules
were
adopted
and
approved
by
this
court
that
the
industry
and
the
public
have
both
benefited
greatly
from
them.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
if
i
have
time
when
i
get
through
the
rest
that
is
certainly
a
part
of
our
argument.
there's
never
been
a
case
like
this
before
the
court.
there
are
other
cases
and
both
sides
confine
some
useful
quotations
in
those
other
cases.
all
of
which,
however,
are
concerned
with
the
problems
somewhat
different
from
that
involved
here.
we
get
considerable
comfort
from
portions
of
this
court's
decisions
in
nelson
brothers,
university
of
georgia,
pottsville
broadcasting
and
particularly
national
broadcasting
company
against
the
united
states
and
this
are
set
out
on
pages
42
and
44
of
our
brief.
the
other
side
finds
comfort
in
mills
against
alabama
and
near
against
minnesota.
most
of
those
cases
were
newspaper
cases.
i've
already
tried
to
argue
that
it
does
not
follow
that
broadcast
regulation
is
exactly
the
same.
mills
involved
absolute
restraint
on
publication
said,
"you
can't
print
it.
it
is
not
involved
here.”
and
near
involved
restraint
in
substance
and
a
large
measure
of
control
over
future
publication
in
any
event.
but
i
would
particularly
rely
on
the
fact
that
both
cases
involved
newspapers
and
did
not
involved
any
aspect
of
the
development
of
the
consequences
of
the
fairness
doctrine
which
is
inherent
and
implicit
in
a
medium
which
uses
a
public
facility
and
is
licensed
to
do
so
under
standards
of
public
interest,
convenience
and
necessity.
it's
true
that
the
broadcasters
are
not
a
public
utility
and
congress
made
that
decision
and
i
think
rightly
in
1927.
but
they
are
a
public
facility
and
needn't
have
public
protection
and
they
have
responsibilities
arising
from
those
facts
which
are
not
shared
by
newspapers
or
others
who
communicate
through
print.
the
columbia
broadcasting
system
in
their
brief
say
that
the
fairness
doctrine
is
not
involved
in
this
case.
but
we
think
it
lies
behind
the
whole
problem.
it
is
an
aspect
of
the
fact
that
the
broadcaster
must
serve
the
public
interest
if
he
is
to
have
and
retain
a
license.
let
us
suppose
for
example
a
station
which
obtains
a
license
and
simply
does
not
operate.
surely,
its
license
will
be
revoked.
does
that
violate
the
first
amendment?
isn't
there
a
freedom
not
to
speak
as
well
as
a
freedom
to
speak?
not
i
venture
to
think
if
you
are
a
radio
or
television
licensee.
or
suppose
that
a
station
decides
that
it
will
broadcast
only
obscenity
or
only
readings
from
books
such
as
fanny
hill
which
have
been
held
to
be
protected
in
print
by
the
first
amendment.
would
such
a
station
serve
the
public
interest
within
the
federal
communication's
act?
and
would
it
violate
the
first
amendment
to
say
that
it
did
not
and
to
revoke
its
license?
or
to
refuse
to
renew
it
when
it
has
expired?
it
may
be
said
that
this
illustrations
deal
with
the
public
interest
but
not
with
fairness.
let
me
move
on
then
to
such
cases
as
the
office
of
communication
of
the
united
church
of
christ
against
the
federal
communications
commission
which
was
decided
not
long
ago
by
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
district
of
columbia
in
a
careful
and
thoughtful
opinion.
that
case
involved
a
television
station
in
jackson,
mississippi
which
it
was
alleged,
discriminated
in
many
ways
against
the
nearly
50%
of
the
persons
in
its
listening
area
who
are
negroes.
i
need
not
detail
the
discriminations,
they
can
be
readily
imagined.
anyone
at
tougaloo
college
in
the
jackson
area
was
surely
aware
of
them.
the
office
of
communications
of
the
united
church
of
christ
to
its
credit
produced
the
considerable
amount
of
money
and
energy
which
was
required
to
do
something
about
it.
the
commission
held
that
they
couldn't
intervene
but
the
commission
did
renew
the
station's
license
for
one
year
only
specifically
stated
to
be
a
trial
period
to
see
if
they
had
mended
their
ways.
on
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia,
everything
was
reversed.
the
court
held
that
the
office
of
communications
was
entitled
to
intervene
that
it
had
a
viewpoint
and
interest
which
was
relevant
in
determining
the
question
whether
the
station
was
being
operated
in
the
public
interest
and
the
court
also
held
that
the
question
of
the
renewal
of
the
license
should
be
decided
on
the
basis
of
full
hearing
and
not
on
the
basis
of
what
was
done
during
a
trial
renewal
of
one
year.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
three
years
is
the
normal
term.
the
commission
can
make
it
shorter.
it
cannot
make
it
longer
and
it
must
be
reconsidered
at
least
every
three
years.
this
hearing
has
now
been
held
and
the
commission
has
granted
a
full
renewal
after
a
full
hearing
and
the
case
is
once
more
on
its
way
to
the
court
of
appeals.
it's
also
clear
that
there
has
been
a
great
change
in
the
program
practices
of
this
station.
i
find
it
hard
to
believe
that
this
has
violated
the
first
amendment.
it
has
rather
been
a
step
toward
the
effectuation
of
the
first
amendment,
a
recognition
of
the
obligation
which
a
licensee
undertakes
when
he
is
granted
an
exclusive
right
to
utilize
a
valuable
public
facility.
the
problem
involved
in
that
case
is
i
submit
not
different
in
the
last
analysis
from
that
involved
here
in
the
development
of
the
personal
attack
rules
as
a
direct
outgrowth
and
development
from
the
fairness
doctrine
which
is
implicit
in
the
concept
of
public
regulations
of
broadcasting.
now,
i
would
like
to
point
out
and
i
think
this
is
of
great
importance
here.
the
regulation
involved
in
this
case
is
entirely
neutral
with
respect
to
the
content
of
speech.
it
applies
in
exactly
the
same
way
and
requires
the
exactly
the
same
action
from
the
broadcaster
regardless
of
what
views
are
expressed
in
the
broadcast
giving
the
right
to
the
reply.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
there
is
no
difference
between
radio
and
television.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
television
is
much
more
dominated
by
the
network.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
which
tend
to
give
it
a
broader
outlook
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
television
has
a
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
a
particular
television
station
has
a
limited
service
area
but
that
is
exactly
the
same
or
substantially
the
same
as
the
limit
of
fm
radio
stations.
am
radio
stations
can
have
a
very
wide
range
and
with
satellite
communication
and
cable
television
and
so
on
the
television
stations
are
not
as
clearly
to
be
distinguished
as
they
used
to
be.
the
government
does
not
by
this
regulation
support
any
point
of
view
except
of
course
the
central
idea
of
the
first
amendment
that
there
should
be
an
opportunity
for
all
points
of
view
to
be
heard.
an
important
corollary
of
these
regulations
is
that
they
strongly
reduce
the
incentive
for
the
government
to
select
its
broadcast
licensees
in
ways
that
might
be
difficult
to
detect
on
the
basis
of
the
political
or
other
views
that
they
are
likely
to
expressed
or
favor
in
their
broadcasting.
now,
this
too
serves
the
policies
of
the
first
amendment.
an
analogy
may
be
found
in
arguments
in
this
court.
it
has
been
my
observation
that
when
one
counsel
speaks,
there
is
always
an
opportunity
for
one
to
speak
on
the
other
side
and
exactly
the
same
amount
of
time
made
available.
and
if
as
happened
in
this
case
a
counsel
seek
to
have
the
case
taken
of
the
summary
docket
and
put
on
the
regular
docket
so
that
they
may
have
an
hour
on
the
side
then
an
hour
is
given
to
the
other
side.
this
might
be
regarded
as
inhibition
upon
his
asking
for
additional
time
for
himself.
an
inhibition
quite
comparable
to
that
complained
of
by
our
opponents
in
these
cases
except
that
it's
the
court's
time
rather
than
the
broadcaster's
time
which
is
being
consumed.
but
the
inhibition
is
obviously
justified
on
the
basis
of
considerations
of
fairness
and
of
values
reflected
in
the
first
amendment
which
favor
an
opportunity
for
both
sides
of
controversies
to
be
heard.
as
i
contended
in
the
argument
in
the
red
lion
case,
our
opponents
in
these
cases
seek
to
put
us
in
opposition
to
the
first
amendment
and
we
do
not
accept
that
position.
i
suggest
that
on
analysis,
it
is
the
government
and
the
federal
communications
commission
which
are
the
real
champions
of
the
first
amendment
here.
the
commission's
regulation
served
to
foster
important
first
amendment
values
which
our
opponents
would
have
the
court
sacrifice
in
the
guise
of
upholding
the
narrow
and
financially
motivated
claim
to
unfettered
control
of
airwaves
that
had
been
licensed
to
their
custody.
this
argument
is
i
submit
fully
supported
by
this
court's
recent
decision
in
the
citizens
publishing
company
case
decided
on
march
10.
the
court
there
quoted
from
the
associated
press
opinion
in
explaining
the
beneficial
effects
of
free
speech
in
the
application
of
antitrust
laws
to
the
communications
media
and
i
was
quite
struck
when
this
case
came
down
with
the
closeness
of
the
application
of
that
quotation
utilized
by
this
court
only
three
weeks
ago.
it
would
be
strange
indeed
if
the
grave
concern
for
freedom
of
the
press
which
prompted
adoption
of
the
first
amendment
should
be
read
as
a
command
that
the
government
was
without
power
to
protect
that
freedom.
the
first
amendment
from
providing
an
argument
against
application
of
the
sherman
act
and
here
i
would
simply
read
it
the
personal
attack
rules,
here
provides
powerful
reasons
to
the
contrary.
that
amendment
rest
on
the
assumption
that
the
widest
possible
dissemination
of
information
from
diverse
and
antagonistic
sources
is
essential
to
the
welfare
of
the
public
that
a
free
press
is
a
condition
of
a
free
society
and
there
is
more
of
the
quotation
very
much
of
which
is
relevant.
this
view
is
also
supported
by
the
venerated
conquering
opinion
of
mr.
justice
brandeis
in
whitney
against
california
which
emphasizes
the
great
reliance
upon
the
value
of
counter
argument
that
is
implicit
in
our
protection
of
free
speech
in
the
first
place.
the
realities
of
the
broadcasting
industry
have
led
the
federal
communications
commission
entirely
properly
in
our
view
to
take
the
steps
needed
in
these
regulations
to
make
the
opportunities
for
counter
argument
a
reality
in
this
important
communications
medium.
in
the
associated
press
case,
the
applicability
of
the
antitrust
laws
to
the
new
services
and
its
members
in
no
way
depended
on
the
content
of
their
new
stories.
this
was
also
true
in
the
citizens
publishing
case
this
term
to
which
i
have
just
referred.
the
restraints
of
trade
in
those
cases
would
have
been
equally
unlawful
if
all
the
editorials
and
new
stories
being
published
had
taken
the
other
point
of
view.
the
court
in
those
cases
upheld
the
government's
right
to
regulate
these
news
media
in
the
interest
of
legitimate
antitrust
objectives
in
a
context
in
which
the
regulation
was
entirely
neutral
with
respect
to
the
content
of
what
was
being
published
and
in
which
no
one
was
being
forbidden
from
publishing
anything
while
the
application
of
the
antitrust
laws
may
have
reduced
profits.
this
is
also
true
of
the
application
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act
or
the
income
tax
to
newspapers
and
broadcasters.
in
this
case,
another
communications
medium
is
being
regulated
in
pursuit
of
an
equally
valid
government
objective
and
in
--
and
again
in
a
way
that
does
not
favor
or
disfavor
any
particular
content
of
speech
and
which
does
not
forbid
the
saying
of
anything.
the
policies
of
the
first
amendment
not
only
favor
access
to
the
media
of
purveyors
of
all
points
of
view
but
the
court
has
specifically
recognized
the
first
amendment
right
in
the
recipient
or
listener
not
to
have
the
channels
of
communication
to
him
stay
so
as
to
favor
or
disfavor
a
particular
point
of
view.
this
was
established
in
the
case
of
lamont
against
the
postmaster
general
cited
at
page
75
of
our
brief
in
which
i
am
inclined
to
think
on
reflection
and
preparing
this
argument
is
perhaps
one
of
the
most
important
cases
which
lead
in
support
of
our
position
here.
it's
true
that
the
court
has
stricken
down
regulations
in
some
cases
which
were
superficially
neutral.
for
example,
the
complete
banning
of
methods
of
communication
such
as
soundtracks
or
handbills
tends
to
discriminate
against
those
espousing
unpopular
ideas
and
who
do
not
have
easy
access
to
the
commercial
communications
media.
similarly,
requirements
of
associational
disclosure
can
--
to
bring
about
burdens
on
those
associated
with
groups
that
are
unpopular
in
the
community
and
thus
to
discourage
association
with
such
groups.
much
the
same
can
be
said
about
taley
against
california
where
the
court
upheld
a
right
to
anonymity
in
the
dissemination
of
political
literature.
there
is
also
an
important
element
of
this
in
the
new
york
times
against
sullivan
line
of
cases
because
a
large
liable
verdict
tends
to
indicate
that
the
plaintiff
in
his
views
are
held
in
high
esteem
in
the
community
and
the
contrary
about
the
defendant
while
it
is
difficult
for
a
truly
unpopular
plaintiff
to
win
much
of
a
liable
verdict
against
the
popular
defendant.
yet
the
main
office
of
the
courts
under
the
first
amendment
is
the
right
to
--
is
to
protect
the
right
to
expressed
views
that
are
not
already
popular
and
accepted
in
the
community
and
i
suggest
that
that
is
the
fundamental
basis
behind
new
york
times
against
sullivan.
now,
we
come
to
the
editorializing
aspect
of
the
rules
which
is
discussed
on
pages
78
to
82
of
our
brief.
here
again,
i'm
a
little
puzzled
because
the
principal
--
some
of
the
principal
briefs
filed
in
the
case
are
filed
by
the
networks
and
the
networks
do
not
editorialize
whether
the
radio
television
news
director
association
engages
in
televising,
i
don't
know.
here
again,
we
have
no
facts,
nothing
to
indicate
that
they
do
or
do
not.
but
in
essence
the
editorializing
rules
are
much
the
same
as
the
personal
attack
rules
they
called
for
opportunity
to
reply.
they
are
an
exemplification
of
the
fairness
doctrine.
they
are
a
means
of
keeping
open
the
channels
of
communication
of
facilitating
the
objective
of
the
first
amendment
which
is
to
provide
an
opportunity
for
the
public
to
hear
and
to
learn.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
they
apply
only
with
respect
to
a
candidate,
that
is
right
and
they
do
not
--
it
does
not
apply
to
a
public
issue
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
some
control
safe
streets
and
other
things
that
people
might
want
to
discuss
about.
it
does
relate
simply
to
candidates
and
thus
provide
an
opportunity
for
candidates
to
reply
if
one
or
another
is
endorsed
in
a
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
it
might
be
very
difficult.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i'm
not
sure
whether
--
well
i
think
it
is
a
problem
when
there
are
multiple
candidates.
i
am
--
we
do
not
know
what
the
commission's
position
would
be
as
to
the
amount
of
time
which
would
be
available
for
other
candidates
and
there
are
some
times
are
i
thought
it
was
17
candidates
in
los
angeles,
and
i
think
it
is
a
very
serious
problem
and
it
may
well
be
that
the
commission
ought
to
give
further
consideration
to
that
sort
of
thing.
what
i
am
really
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
it
does
not
very
specifically
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
does
not
specify
equal
time.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
is
--
it
is
whatever
is
required
by
the
overall
scope
of
the
fairness
doctrine.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
a
reasonable
opportunity
to
respond.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
in
the
--
in
the
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
statute
of?
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
radio
act
of
1927
and
the
federal
communications
act
of
1934
do
have
the
equal
time
provision
which
allows
the
candidate
which
provides
that
if
the
station
sells
time
or
gives
time
to
a
candidate,
it
must
give
equal
time
on
the
same
terms
to
every
other
candidate
and
that
is
the
equal
time
provision
which
was
then
amended
in
1959
to
exclude
bona
fide
news
broadcast
essentially
the
same
exclusions
which
are
made
in
this
regulation.
it
was
suspended
in
the
1960
campaign
but
was
enforced
and
followed
in
1964
and
in
1968
is
it
seems
to
us
the
fundamental
recognition
by
congress
in
the
most
sensitive
area
of
the
applicability
of
the
fairness
doctrine
to
radio
and
television
broadcasting
and
it
is
with
respect
to
the
amendment
in
1959
which
accepted
news
programs
that
congress
expressly
included
a
provision
saying
that
nothing
there
should
protect
radio
and
television
stations
from
their
obligation
to
operate
in
the
public
interest
which
we
contend
is
a
legislative,
congressional
recognition
of
the
validity
in
the
application
of
the
fairness
doctrine.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
mr.
justice,
on
the
contrary
as
it
is
our
position
here,
it
is
free
to
up,
it
is
to
open
the
channels
communication
rather
than
to
control
them
or
dominate
them
or
direct
them.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
there
is
such
a
provision
in
the
federal
communications
act
today
and
we
don't
for
the
moment
concede
that
we
are
seeking
to
employ
censorship.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
there
was
then,
yes.
there
has
been
from
the
beginning.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
it
is
quite
plain
that
the
congress
for
more
than
40
years
has
not
regarded
a
requirement
of
equal
time
as
censorship.
quite
contrary,
it
is
a
freeing
of
the
channel's
communication.
we
are
fighting
for
the
first
amendment
here.
i
hate
to
yield
that
the
broadcasters
whose
interest
may
not
be
as
broad
as
ours.
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
may
it
please
the
court.
my
friend,
professor
cox,
if
i
may
call
him
--
well
i've
known
him
long
as
brought
before
you
as
i
knew
he
would
the
extracts
from
eric
sevareid's
broadcast
which
are
in
the
volume
2
of
the
appendix
and
the
excerpt
from
“face
the
nation.”
after
the
luncheon
recess,
he
has
pointed
out
to
you
that
neither
one
would
be
affected
in
any
way
by
this
regulation
that
they
are
both
expressly
exempted
by
the
terms
of
the
regulation.
the
first
one
which
relating
to
the
death
of
henry
luce
did
not
strike
me
as
being
an
attack
but
rather
as
fair
comment
but
it
would
be
exempt
in
any
event
because
it
came
in
a
bona
fide
newscast
and
the
“face
the
nation”
program
is
exempt
because
it
was
a
bona
fide
interview.
now,
those
terms
are
words
of
art
in
the
broadcasting
industry.
the
members
of
the
industry
know
what
they
mean.
these
terms
are
exactly
the
same
as
those
under
section
315
and
there
is
a
section
315
primer
which
spells
them
out.
i
might
point
out
that
under
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
“face
the
nation”
program
would
be
covered
by
the
news
interview
exception.
the
hoffer
program
is
not.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
is
a
conversation,
not
a
part
of
what
comes
within
in
bona
fide
news
interview.
mr.
cox
said
that
he
couldn't
understand
the
distinction
but
the
distinction
which
the
commission
endeavored
to
work
out
was
one
with
respect
to
timing
when
you
have
to
move
fast
and
have
to
get
in
on
the
news
program
including
commentary,
you
are
free
from
this
although
you're
subject
the
fairness
rules
and
documentaries
and
then
a
program
like
the
interview
with
hoffer
which
after
all
was
taped
and
probably
done
days
before
it
was
broadcast.
there
is
plenty
of
opportunity
to
consider
thoughtfully
and
rationally
what
should
be
done
about
it.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
is
a
news
interview
and
is
exempt
under
the
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no
but
it
is
the
type
of
thing
where
you
bring
in
somebody
and
it
is
spontaneous
and
the
station
can't
plan
in
advance
and
doesn't
know
what's
going
to
appear.
at
any
rate,
it
is
exempt
under
this
regulation?
there
is
no
question
about
that.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
there
are
not
in
this
regulation
but
i
understand
that
they
are
in
the
section
315
primer
which
does
summarize
the
commission's
rules
with
respect
to
the
meaning
of
that
terminology
and
i
don't
understand
that
the
other
side
to
questions
that.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
not
--
not
quite.
they
are
subject
to
the
fairness
doctrine
which
requires
that
overall
they
must
have
a
balanced
program.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
didn't
understand
mr.
cox
is
saying
that
and
if
he
did
it
goes
beyond
anything
that
i
understand
the
regulations
to
require.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
if
--
paragraph
5
does
impose
the
standard
of
the
fairness
doctrine
but
does
not
require
a
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
personal
attack
rule.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
i
think
that
is
the
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
personal
attack
rule
does
require
that
a
particular
person
attack
to
have
an
opportunity
to
respond.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
there
something
close
to
that
in
this
paragraph
5
but
it
is
not
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
is
not
what
you
said
--
what
was
said
before.
the
top
of
page
233
of
the
record
does
our
revision
affords
the
licensee
considerable
leeway
in
this
news
type
program
but
it
still
requires
that
fairness
be
met
either
by
the
licensee's
action
of
fairly
presenting
the
contrasting
viewpoint
on
the
attack
issue
which
he
can
do
in
any
way
he
want
but
it
must
be
fair
or
by
notifying
and
allowing
the
person
or
group
attack
a
reasonable
opportunity
to
respond.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no
matter
is
an
alternative,
one
or
two
ways
he
can
do
it.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
i
think
that's
a
harder
question
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
that
--
that
he
is
--
we
come
close
to
it
under
the
fairness
doctrine.
he
is
required
to
be
fair
and
if
he
doesn't
provide
fairness
through
some
other
spokesman,
i
think
he
is
under
some
obligation
to
provide
the
fairness
himself
but
i
find
it,
i
shrink
somewhat
obviously.
this
is
as
settle
and
slippery
case,
all
the
way
through
and
i
shrink
from
being
caught
in
a
place
where
i
say
that
he
must
say
something.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
that
is
certainly
one
of
escape
patches
where
ate
least
there
is
nothing
in
this
regulation
now
which
requires
that
action.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
he
is
never
so
required
and
he
has
never
required
to
broadcasts
the
government
release
which
is
prepared
for
him.
there
is
no
requirement
as
to
the
specific
speech.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
at
one
time
we're
told
that
the
rules
are
vague
and
we
don't
know
how
to
comply
with
him.
at
another
time
we're
told
that
they
are
arbitrary.
there
is
only
one
thing
you
can
do.
you
must
have
the
person
attacked
into
respond.
the
commission
has
said
that
the
rule
will
not
be
used
as
a
basis
for
sanctions
against
those
licensee
who
in
good
faith
seek
to
comply
with
the
personal
attack
principle
and
in
a
case
decided
within
the
past
year
arising
under
the
rules,
the
commission
said
that
there
was
no
question
of
imposing
a
forfeiture
under
circumstances
of
this
case
where
the
station
has
made
a
good
faith
judgment
and
has
actually
do
not
reflect
the
flagrant
clear
cut
case
of
violation
for
which
we
stated
we
would
consider
in
position
of
a
forfeiture.
incidentally,
the
commission
has
also
stated
in
a
case
decided
within
the
past
few
months
that
the
commission's
experience
over
the
years
of
operation
in
this
area
that
there
has
been
no
indication
of
inhibition
or
robust
debate
by
our
fairness
policies.
indeed,
such
debate
has
been
increasing
not
declining
during
the
last
seven
years
when
the
personal
attack
principle
was
being
developed
and
brought
specifically
the
notice
of
all
licensee
that's
the
story
of
broadcasting
case
and
i
would
like
to
close
simply
with
a
reference
to
the
anti-defamation
league
case
which
is
cited
in
the
briefs
into
which
reference
was
made
by
mr.
cox.
that
is
the
case
where
a
station
broadcast
anti-semitic
material.
the
fact
was
that
on
complaint,
the
station
offered
the
anti-semitic
league
an
opportunity
to
reply
and
they
declined
that
opportunity.
they
said
we
don't
want
to
reply,
we
want
your
licensee
revoked
and
the
proceeding
was
heard
before
the
commission
and
the
commission
determined
that
on
overall
balance
they
had
given
an
opportunity
for
a
response
and
by
other
things
they
had
done.
they
had
complied
with
the
fairness
rule
and
that
was
sustained
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
this
court
denies
certiorari
just
recently.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
mr.
justice
that
you
can
pass
on
the
question
whether
the
commission
as
part
of
issues
some
kind
of
a
regulation.
i
would
think
it
will
be
very
unfortunate
for
the
court
to
hold
in
this
case
on
this
record
that
the
commission
has
no
such
power.
i
can
well
understand
the
court's
holding
that
we
don't
think
this
necessarily
is
the
last
word
and
that
as
cases
come
up
we
may
need
to
consider
it.
we
have
a
parallel
with
respect
to
unfair
labor
practice
which
i
think
is
no
more
vague
than
the
statement
in
this
personal
attack
rule.
unfair
labor
practice
occasionally
impinges
on
the
area
of
freedom
of
speech
and
the
fact
that
what
a
person
says
may
be
an
unfair
labor
practice
undoubtedly
has
some
inhibitory
effect
but
the
way
that
has
been
worked
out
is
through
the
years
cases
come
up
in
which
particular
facts
appeared
and
somebody
said
something
under
certain
circumstances
and
the
court
decided
whether
or
not
it
was
an
unfair
labor
practice.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
what
ought
to
be
done
here,
that
it
ought
to
be
left
for
the
working
out
of
the
mind
through
the
process
of
gradual
adjudication
in
which
it
will
be
determined
whether
under
certain
circumstances,
certain
statements
were
personal
attacks
and
whether
the
action
of
the
commission
in
response
thereto
was
an
appropriate
action
under
those
circumstances.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
the
first
of
two
cases
presenting
related
to
questions
but
in
different
circumstances.
in
this
case,
we
have
specific
facts
but
no
formally
announced
rule
or
regulation.
in
the
next
case,
united
states
and
federal
communications
commission
against
the
radio
television
news
directors
association
et
al.,
number
717,
we
have
a
formal
regulation
but
no
facts.
i
will
try
to
keep
my
argument
separated
as
far
as
the
two
cases
are
concern,
but
much
of
the
argument
is
necessarily
applicable
to
both
cases.
in
the
first
place,
i
would
like
to
make
it
plain
that
this
is
not
a
sudden
determination
of
the
federal
communications
commission
that
it
will
be
righteous
and
seek
to
enforce
some
kind
of
arbitrary
standards
on
the
broadcasting
industry.
on
the
contrary,
the
problem
is
one
of
long
standing.
it
goes
back
for
close
to
50
years.
the
first
traces
of
it
that
i've
seen
are
found
in
an
address
of
the
then
secretary
of
commerce
herbert
hoover
in
1924
when
the
commerce
department
was
charged
with
the
licensing
of
radio
stations,
and
he
pointed
out
that
there
were
great
problems
in
the
handling
of
this
new
medium
and
the
problems
of
seeing
that
all
points
of
view
were
properly
expressed
among
them.
in
its
foundation,
the
problem
is
inherent
in
communication
through
electromagnetic
waves.
from
the
very
beginning,
congress
and
the
federal
communications
commission
and
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
the
broadcast
industry
had
been
grouping
for
a
sound
and
workable
solution.
i'm
quite
sure
that
we
have
not
found
the
final
answer.
there's
still
room
for
improvement
through
more
thought
and
more
experience.
but
i
feel
its
substantial
progress
has
been
made
in
dealing
with
a
fundamental
and
important
issue.
let
me
start
by
referring
to
some
reflections
of
the
problem
which
are
found
in
the
basic
statute.
i
am
going
to
quote
a
few
passages
from
the
communication
act
of
1934,
but
i
would
point
out
that
virtually
all
of
these
were
also
in
the
federal
radio
act
of
1927.
the
very
opening
sentence
says
in
section
301
of
title
47,
“it
is
the
purpose
of
this
chapter
among
other
things
to
maintain
the
control
of
the
united
states
over
all
the
channels
of
interstate
and
foreign
radio
transmission,
and
to
provide
for
the
use
of
such
channels,
but
not
the
ownership
thereof
by
persons
for
limited
periods
of
time.
and
no
license
granted
under
this
section
shall
be
construed
to
create
any
right
beyond
the
terms,
conditions
and
period
of
the
license.”
in
section
303,
there
is
an
expressed
provision
that
a
license
maybe
revoked
if
the
licensee
has
transmitted
superfluous
radio
communications
or
signals
or
communications
containing
profane
or
obscene
words,
language
or
meaning.
and
i
suppose
it's
reasonably
plain
that
a
station's
license
could
be
revoked
under
that
section,
eventhough
the
language
used
was
such
that
could
not
had
been
enjoined
from
being
used
because
of
the
first
amendment.
and
then,
there
are
provisions
for
licensing
under
which,
the
commission
if
public
convenience,
interest
or
necessity
will
be
served
thereby
may
grant
licenses
for
periods
of
three
years.
and
there
are
provisions
for
revocation
of
licenses
in
case
the
station
does
not
serve
the
public
interest,
convenience
and
necessity.
there
are
provisions
for
revocation
of
licenses
in
cases
of
willful
and
repeated
violation
or,
of
or
willful
or
repeated
failure
to
observe
any
provision
of
this
chapter
or
any
rule
or
regulation
of
the
commission
authorized
by
this
chapter.
and
then,
there
is
section
315,
the
equal
time
provision,
and
i
point
out
that
that
was
included
in
the
federal
radio
act
of
1927.
it
is
thus
42
years
old,
and
in
its
particular
field,
it
is
an
expression
of
the
fairness
doctrine
under
which
if
a
station
gives
time
to
a
political
candidate,
it
must
give
equal
time
to
other
political
candidates
with
qualifications
which
were
put
in
1959
into
which
i
will
refer
a
little
later.
in
1929,
in
a
brief
which
the
commission
filed
in
the
great
lakes
case,
you
find
something
of
a
beginning
of
an
articulation
of
the
fairness
doctrine.
and
over
the
next
two
decades,
the
commission
in
a
series
of
individual
rulings
undertook
to
express
the
obligation
of
then
radio
stations
to
meet
their
requirements
of
the
fairness
doctrine,
this
being
an
interpretation
by
the
commission
of
the
standard
included
by
congress
in
the
statute
that
these
stations
must
operate
in
the
public
interest.
in
1960,
in
19
--
yes,
in
1960,
there
--
well,
let
me
wait
before
1959
and
'60.
in
1940,
in
the
ruling
in
the
mayflower
broadcasting
case,
the
commission
instructed
radio
stations
that
they
could
not
engage
in
editorializing.
this
may
or
may
not
have
been
the
right
thing
to
do,
but
it
was
an
articulation
of
the
fairness
doctrine.
there
was
concern
that
stations
with
the
great
power
they
have
could
constantly
reiterate
one
point
of
view
and
shut
off
all
others,
and
the
commission's
approach
in
1940
was
to
say
you
cannot
editorialize.
but
in
1949,
after
experienced
with
that,
the
commission
issued
its
report
on
editorializing
in
which
it
changed
its
rule
and
it
said
you
can
editorialize
but
you
must
allow
an
opportunity
for
a
response
by
responsible
people.
now,
that
was
the
situation
in
1949.
ten
years
later,
we
come
to
1959
when
after
the
lar
daly
case
which
arose
under
section
315
involving
equal
time,
there
was
great
concern
because
the
commission
and
a
court
of
appeals
had
held
that
every
candidate
was
entitled
to
equal
time,
eventhough
he
had
only
a
miniscule
support.
and
congress
amended
section
315
in
1959
to
provide
that
appearances
on
a
bonafide
newscast,
a
bonafide
news
interview,
a
bonafide
news
documentary,
and
on
the
spot
coverage
of
bonafide
news
events
need
not
be
taken
into
account
in
determining
the
long
established
congressional
mandate,
and
expression
i
believe
of
the
notion
of
the
fairness
doctrine
of
equal
time
for
political
candidates.
and
then,
it
is
very
significant
i
think
that
as
a
part
of
that
amendment,
congress
enacted
these
words,
“nothing
in
the
foregoing
sentence,"
that
is
the
exception
of
bonafide
new
broadcast,
"nothing
in
the
foregoing
sentence
shall
be
construed
as
relieving
broadcasters
in
connection
with
the
presentation
of
newscast,
news
interviews,
news
documentaries
and
on
the
spot
coverage
of
news
events
from
the
obligation
imposed
upon
them
under
this
chapter
to
operate
in
the
public
interest
and
to
afford
reasonable
opportunity
for
the
discussion
of
conflicting
views
on
issues
of
public
importance.”
and
the
statute
also
provided
in
paragraph
c,
the
commission
shall
prescribe
appropriate
rules
and
regulations
to
carry
out
the
provisions
of
this
section.
since
our
brief
was
filed,
i
came
across
another
related
matter.
in
1960,
congress
suspended
the
equal
time
provision
for
the
1960
presidential
campaign
only,
and
in
that
statute
which
was
a
temporary
statute
and
therefore
isn't
included
in
the
u.s.
code,
there
was
this
additional
sentence,
nothing
in
the
foregoing
shall
be
construed
as
relieving
broadcasters
from
the
obligation
imposed
upon
them
under
this
act
to
operate
in
the
public
interests.
now,
as
merely
accumulative,
it
adds
nothing
to
the
provision
that
isn't
section
315,
but
it
does
show
the
continuing
concern
of
congress
to
maintain
the
requirement
of
operation
in
the
public
interest
not
as
a
mere
private
venture,
which
is
the
heart
of
the
fairness
doctrine.
finally,
some
four
years
later,
the
commission
put
out
a
report
which
is
called
the
fairness
premier.
as
it
appears
in
the
federal
register,
it
looks
like
this.
it
is
in
essence,
a
digest
of
the
decisions
which
the
commission
had
reached
in
this
area
followed
by
two
appendices
which
are
reports
of
the
commission
and
one
of
them
is
a
report
of
the
commission
on
editorializing
by
broadcast
licensees.
the
other
is
a
rather
full
and
comprehensive
history
of
the
fairness
doctrine.
and
putting
this
out,
the
commission
said,
“it
is
the
purpose
of
this
public
notice
to
advice
broadcast
licensees
and
members
of
the
public
of
the
rights,
obligations,
and
responsibilities
of
such
licensees
under
the
commission's
fairness
doctrine,
which
is
applicable
in
any
case
in
which
broadcast
facilities
are
used
for
the
discussion
of
a
controversial
issue
of
public
importance.
now,
there
is
included
in
the
fairness
premier,
digest
of
several
cases
which
involved
personal
attacks.
and
that
is
the
source,
not
the
chronological
origin
but
the
place
where
there
is
contained
and
in
official
publication,
the
then
statement
of
the
commission's
views
with
respect
to
the
particular
application
of
the
fairness
doctrine
which
has
come
to
be
known
as
the
personal
attack
doctrine.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
1964
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
july
25,
1964.
i
believe
it's
been
put
out
in
a
different
format
as
a
pamphlet,
but
this
is
the
way
in
which
it
appeared
in
the
federal
register
for
july
25,
1964.
mr.
robb
has
stated
the
facts
of
the
red
lion
case
accurately,
and
i
have
no
supplement
to
make
the
red
lion
station
did
broadcast
a
personal
attack
on
mr.
cook.
mr.
cook
sought
an
opportunity
to
reply.
he
was
told
he
could
have
it
if
he
would
pay
for
it
or
if
he
would
certify
that
he
was
unable
to
pay
for
it.
mr.
cook
then
wrote
to
the
commission
and
there
was
an
exchange
of
letters
between
the
station
and
the
commission.
but
the
first
question
that
arises
in
my
mind
on
this
is
whether
the
case
is
really
properly
before
the
courts.
now,
what
is
the
order
here?
in
the
record,
one
will
find
two
letters.
one,
incidentally,
they
both
appear
at
least
twice
in
the
record.
the
letter
of
october
6,
1965
appears
on
page
9
and
also
on
page
37.
that
letter
ends
"accordingly,
you
are
requested
to
advice
the
commission
of
your
plans
to
comply
with
the
fairness
doctrine
applicable
to
the
situation."
the
station
then
wrote
back
to
the
commission
and
on
december
9th,
the
commission
wrote
a
rather
long
letter
discussing
the
legal
questions,
and
i
have
the
greatest
difficulty
finding
that
there
was
any
order
of
any
kind
in
there.
there
may
have
been
some
indication
that
if
the
station
didn't
comply
with
this
that
when
the
time
came
for
their
license
to
be
renewed,
this
would
be
a
factor
to
be
taken
into
account,
but
there
was
no
order
within
any
understanding
that
i
have
had
with
respect
to
the
reviewability
of
administrative
orders.
indeed,
the
court
of
appeals
panel
first
held
that
there
was
nothing
reviewable
here,
but
this
was
overturned
by
the
court
of
appeals
en
banc
without
any
opinion.
and
i
would
point
out
that
this
was
in
march
1967,
a
few
months
before
this
court's
decision
in
the
abbott
laboratories
case,
but
i
would
mention
in
connection
with
that
particularly
before
this
court's
decision
in
the
toilet
goods
association
against
gardner
which
was
decided
at
the
same
time.
and
it's
very
hard
for
me
to
see
that
this
is
a
sort
of
order
that
should
be
reviewed.
let
me
simply
interject
here
that
after
the
fairness
premier
was
put
out,
the
commission
did
have
a
formal
rule
making
proceeding
and
did
make
rules
on
personal
attack
and
political
editorializing.
those
rules
are
not
involved
in
this
case
but
they
are
the
subject
matter
of
the
next
case,
number
717.
in
their
brief
in
the
next
case,
a
counsel
for
their
radio
television
news
directors
association
say
quote,
“new
york
times
v.
sullivan
governs
this
case”,
just
as
simple
as
that.
if
the
new
york
times
case
governs
that
case,
i
suppose
it
governs
this
one
as
well.
so,
i
would
like
to
start
with
a
consideration
of
the
new
york
times
case
and
the
differences
between
the
problem
there
and
here.
the
new
york
times
case
was
a
newspaper
case,
a
press
case
in
the
literal
sense.
now,
we
do
not
have
a
federal
press
commission.
we
do
have
a
federal
communications
commission.
we
do
not
license
newspapers,
nor
other
elements
of
the
printed
media.
we
do
license
radio
and
television
stations.
it
is
inconceivable
that
we
would
undertake
to
enjoin
a
newspaper
from
publishing.
we
can
and
would
enjoin
a
radio
or
television
station
from
operating
if
it
did
not
have
a
license
from
the
federal
communications
commission.
so,
there
must
be
some
difference.
it
obviously
lies
in
the
fact
that
radio
and
television
exercise
a
privilege
which
is
not
utilized
by
the
printed
press.
radio
and
television
use
a
portion
of
the
public
domain.
they
have
and
require
exclusive
use
of
a
portion
of
the
radio
spectrum.
without
their
license,
they
would
not
be
entitled
to
use
it.
with
their
license,
they
are
entitled
to
use
it
to
the
exclusion
of
everyone
else.
they
not
only
have
a
grant
of
a
portion
of
the
public
domain,
they
have
a
considerable
measure
of
protection
from
competition.
in
many
communities,
there
is
only
one
radio
station
or
one
television
station.
even
when
there
are
more
as
in
the
big
cities,
the
protection
from
competition
is
substantial.
as
its
evidence
indeed
by
the
prices
in
the
tens
of
millions
of
dollars
which
are
paid
for
a
radio
and
television
stations.
there
can
only
be
a
limited
number
of
very
high
frequency
television
stations
and
uhf
or
ultra
high
frequency
is
not
yet
very
effective
in
competition,
and
similarly,
the
number
of
am
radio
stations
is
limited.
does
the
fact
that
radio
and
television
can
operate
only
when
they
are
privilege
to
use
a
limited
public
facility
mean
that
they
are
outside
the
protection
of
the
first
amendment?
of
course,
that
is
not
our
position.
we
are
all
guardians
of
the
first
amendment,
government
as
well
as
broadcasters.
the
question
to
be
determined
is
the
application
of
the
amendment
in
this
particular
situation.
there
is
a
great
effort
here
and
in
the
following
case
to
put
us
in
the
position
of
attacking
the
first
amendment
and
seeking
to
rescript
--
restricted
scope.
we
do
not
accept
such
a
position.
we
rely
on
the
first
amendment
and
contend
that
our
position
is
the
one
that
makes
it
effective
as
against
the
narrow
and
i
may
say
selfish
interest
of
the
broadcasters.
the
personal
attack
rules
do
not
forbid
anything.
the
broadcaster
can
still
put
on
whatever
he
wants
to
put
on.
the
personal
attack
rules
do
not
control
the
response.
they
merely
provide
that
there
must
be
an
opportunity
for
response.
in
order
that
the
listener
may
have
the
benefit
of
robust
debate
as
a
consequence
of
the
publicly
owned
radio
spectrum
being
used
in
the
public
interest,
not
merely
as
the
exclusive
private
fee
of
the
broadcaster.
in
one
of
the
briefs
in
the
next
case,
professor
harry
calvin
is
quoted.
in
this
article,
professor
calvin
says
quote,
“think
of
a
town
meeting
where
the
chair
would
rule
that
each
speaker
must
be
fair
to
both
sides.”
end
of
the
quotation.
and
now,
i
like
the
town
meeting
analogy.
i've
taken
part
in
a
good
many
of
them
and
they
are
remarkable
example
of
democracy
in
action.
but
i
think
that
professor
calvin
has
misapplied
the
analogy.
he
has
misapprehended
the
function
and
the
opportunity
and
the
responsibility
of
the
moderator.
let
me
put
it
this
way.
think
of
a
town
meeting
where
the
moderator
did
not
see
to
it
that
both
sides
have
full
and
fair
and
equal
opportunity
to
speak.
can
you
imagine
a
moderator,
who
after
one
side
have
spoken
in
strong
and
fighting
attack
would
then
tell
the
opposition
speaker,
"no,
you
can't
speak
here.
perhaps
you
can
get
a
hearing
in
some
other
town
but
not
here.
he
would
not
last
long
as
a
moderator.
the
very
essence
of
his
post
is
to
run
the
meeting
in
a
fair
manner;
giving
all
relevant
viewpoints
or
reasonable
opportunity
to
be
heard.
he
does
not
control
one
side
or
the
other.
he
does
not
censor.
he
does
not
force
anyone
to
speak.
and
when
someone
wants
to
speak,
he
does
not
tel
him
what
to
say.
he
keeps
the
channels
of
communication
open.
he
assures
full
debate
as
robust
as
the
citizens
want
to
make
it.
he
sets
the
ground
rules,
but
he
does
not
control
or
take
part
or
censor.
is
this
not
a
good
analogy
for
the
present
case?
it
is
the
commission
which
is
in
the
position
of
the
moderator.
the
commission
does
not
control
or
take
part
or
forbid
or
censor,
but
it
does
represent
the
public
interest
in
assuring
that
the
public
facility
is
used
for
the
public
benefit.
the
personal
attack
rules
do
not
rest
on
protection
for
the
person
attacked,
they
are
for
the
benefit
of
the
public.
as
a
part
of
the
overall
fairness
doctrine
which
is
designed
to
make
the
first
amendment
effective
and
which
derives
directly
from
the
public
ownership
of
the
radio
spectrum
and
the
enactment
of
congress
that
radio
and
television
stations
must
operate
for
the
public
interest,
convenience
and
necessity.
this
leads
directly
to
the
next
portion
of
the
argument.
it
is
said
that
application
of
the
personal
attack
rules
will
inhibit
radio
and
television
operators.
and
that
they
will
prefer
not
to
put
on
controversial
programs
because
they
will
lose
money
if
time
has
to
be
made
available
for
a
reply.
this,
it
seems
to
me
begs
the
question.
as
in
many
legal
arguments,
we
are
in
this
case
i
think
very
much
at
the
risk
of
the
tyranny
of
labels.
i've
already
referred
to
one
aspect
to
this
which
might
be
put
in
the
syllogism,
major
premise,
the
press
cannot
be
required
to
adhere
to
a
fairness
rule,
minor
premise,
radio
and
television
are
part
of
the
press
conclusion.
and
therefore,
radio
and
television
cannot
be
subjected
to
the
fairness
rule.
as
i've
argued,
the
label
is
not
applicable.
and
now
on
this
point,
we're
subjected
to
the
pressure
of
another
label.
it
is
said
that
freedom
of
the
press
cannot
be
inhibited.
it
would
be
inhibited
if
there
were
a
personal
attack
rule.
therefore,
the
personal
attack
rule
must
fall
under
the
first
amendment.
this
i
submit
is
in
part
pure
assertion
and
in
remaining
part
false
reasoning.
there
is
no
evidence
whatever
in
this
record
that
the
red
lion
station
was
or
would
inhibited
by
the
application
of
the
personal
attack
doctrine.
in
this
very
case,
it
went
ahead
and
broadcast
the
attack
after
the
commission
had
published
the
fairness
premier
in
1964
and
it
knew
just
what
was
expected
of
it
by
the
commission.
but
beyond
that
as
i've
said,
the
argument
is
based
on
faulty
analysis
for
it
assumes
that
every
minute
of
the
time
available
to
a
broadcast
licensee
is
his
to
use
as
he
sees
fit
for
his
own
personal
financial
profit.
but
he
isn't
remains
a
licensee.
he
is
using
a
public
facility.
his
license
expressly
provides
that
it
must
be
used
for
the
public
convenience
and
interest.
if
he
does
not
meet
the
standard
of
the
public
interest,
the
commission
may
fail
to
renew
his
license,
it
can
even
cancel
it.
and
i
will
continue
tomorrow.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
before
resuming
my
argument,
i
would
like
to
make
a
reference
to
one
matter
to
which
i
referred
yesterday
afternoon.
i
raised
question
as
to
whether
there
was
something
in
this
exchange
of
letters
between
the
commission
and
the
red
lion
broadcasting
which
constituted
and
ordered,
which
was
properly
subject
for
judicial
review.
i
should
point
out
that
the
question
whether
there
was
something
reviewable
there
was
presented
by
petition
for
rehearing
en
banc
by
the
government,
which
was
joined
in
by
the
other
side
and
that
my
reference
there
should
be
simply
my
own
personal
puzzlement
as
to
what
in
these
days
constitutes
a
proper
subject
of
judicial
review.
at
the
conclusion
of
the
argument
yesterday
afternoon,
i
was
referring
to
the
suggestion
that
the
personal
attack
regulations
would
inhibit
actions
by
broadcasters.
the
inhibition
i've
suggested
lies
--
the
suggestion
of
inhibition
i
contended,
lies
in
a
misapprehension
of
the
status
of
the
broadcaster.
it
based
on
the
assumption
that
every
minute
of
the
time
available
to
a
broadcast
licensee
is
his
to
use
for
his
own
personal
financial
profit.
and
i
was
arguing
that
his
license
allows
him
to
use
a
public
facility.
it
provides
that
it
must
be
used
for
the
public
convenience
and
interest.
if
he
doesn't
meet
the
standard
of
the
public
interest,
the
commission
may
fail
to
renew
his
license,
it
can
even
cancel
it.
and
certainly,
the
personal
attack
doctrine
as
an
aspect
of
the
fairness
doctrine
does
no
more
than
to
say
that
he
must
use
his
privilege
in
this
particular
circumstance
in
the
public
interest.
his
license
comes
to
him
burdened
with
a
public
obligation,
and
he
is
in
no
position
to
claim
that
he
is
inhibited
if
he
is
required
to
make
a
modest
performance
on
the
obligation.
experience
shows
that
there
is
little
trouble
under
the
fairness
and
personal
attack
doctrines
with
the
great
networks
and
the
stations
which
they
control.
the
problem
arises
mostly
with
the
small
independent
stations
as
in
the
present
case.
as
i've
already
indicated,
there's
no
evidence
here,
no
showing
of
any
hardship,
or
even
of
lost
of
revenue
by
the
station.
mr.
robb
in
his
argument
yesterday
admitted
that
there
was
a
personal
attack,
so,
there
is
no
question
here
about
the
suggested
vagueness
of
the
regulation.
the
only
objection
that
the
station
made
was
to
the
granting
of
free
time.
they
made
no
suggestion
as
to
a
problem
of
scheduling.
moreover,
as
has
been
indicated,
they
had
a
format.
they
had
a
free
speech
hour
each
week
when
they
could
readily
have
putted
in.
indeed,
many
small
stations
play
a
great
deal
of
music
and
an
appropriate
response
to
a
personal
attack
could
have
been
put
on
the
air
in
place
of
a
single
recording.
the
commission
does
not
undertake
to
tell
the
station
just
where
the
response
must
be
put
as
long
as
the
station
chose
an
effort
to
be
fair.
the
placing
of
the
response
is
up
to
it.
if
it
can
get
a
sponsor,
it's
free
to
do
so.
otherwise,
it
must
be
on
sustaining
time.
but
as
i've
indicated,
that
is
part
of
the
obligation.
it
undertakes
when
it
accepts
its
license.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
let
me
say
in
response
to
that
mr.
justice
that
the
fairness
premier
had
been
published
before
this.
the
fairness
premier
is
essentially
a
digest
of
previous
rulings
of
the
commission.
i
think
i'm
right
in
my
recollection
that
at
least
one
of
those
rulings
involved
the
question
of
free
time.
it
was
not
as
explicit
as
it
was
in
this
exchange
of
letters,
but
i
think
it
is
inherent
in
the
fairness
doctrine.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
there
were
a
165
to
broadcast
this
program.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
simple
offer
of
time.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
time
if
you
wanted
to
pay
for
it.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
but
let
me
suggest
to
you
mr.
justice
that
paying
for
time
on
a
165
stations
is
pretty
substantial
burden
to
put
on
the
person
involved
here,
particularly
when
as
this
our
submission,
this
is
really
the
obligation
of
the
station
in
meeting
the
statutory
requirement
of
operating
in
the
public
interest
which
over
the
course
of
a
long
evolution
has
developed
into
the
fairness
doctrine
and
more
specifically
into
the
personal
attack
doctrine.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
not
as
clear
as
i
would
like
to
have
it
to
be.
there
was
no
--
nothing
stated
in
bold
face
type
that
you
must
do
this
on
free
time
if
you
can't
get
a
sponsor.
i
think
it
was
understood
and
i
don't
think
that
red
lion
was
surprised
when
the
response
came
from
the
commission.
certainly,
that
is
a
part
of
the
issue
here.
i
think
it
would
be
unfortunate
in
the
long
run
to
have
it
said
that
"well,
you
can
reply
if
you
can
pay
for
it,
or
you
can
reply
if
you
can
get
sponsor,"
that
would
seem
to
be
a
considerable
hindrance
on
a
free
speech
and
the
development
of
a
robust
debate
which
is
the
underlying
objective
of
the
first
amendment.
it
is
our
position
that
the
objective
of
the
fairness
premier
of
the
commission's
action
here
is
to
implement
the
first
amendment,
not
to
subvert
it.
to
induce
the
licensees
to
recognize
their
obligation
under
the
amendments
since
they
are
utilizing
a
portion
of
a
public
facility,
it
has
been
argued
that
the
first
amendment
requires
an
opportunity
for
response
in
a
situation
like
this,
that
in
effect
the
united
states
would
be
denying
free
speech
if
there
were
no
personal
attack
doctrine.
i
don't
go
that
far,
but
i
do
contend
that
the
regulation
here
involved
on
these
facts
does
implement
the
first
amendment,
does
protect
the
public's
right
to
hear
which
is
the
underlying
basis
of
the
first
amendment,
and
tends
towards
encouraging
robust
in
spirited
debate
in
accordance
with
the
thrust
and
objective
of
the
first
amendment.
and
for
these
reasons,
we
would
submit
that
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i'm
referring
for
a
moment
to
the
previous
case
in
mr.
justice
stewart's
question.
i
would
call
attention
to
ruling
number
17
in
the
fairness
primer
which
deals
specifically
with
the
question
of
paid
sponsorship
and
advices
the
stations
through
recounting
the
ruling
in
a
case
of
the
cullman
broadcasting
company
and
says
that
it
is
not
sufficient
if
you
simply
offer
sponsored
time.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
fairness
primer
was
published
july
1,
1964
and
not
only
was
published
in
the
federal
register
but
it
appears
in
the
record
that
it
was
distributed
to
each
broadcasting
facility
in
the
country.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
hargis
--
it
was
in
1965.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
following
--
following
this
event.
now
turning
to
number
717,
the
radio
television
and
news
directors
association
case
which
there
are
a
considerable
number
of
other
respondents,
a
number
of
whom
have
filed
briefs,
i
think
i
might
say
at
this
point
that
i
take
at
certain
satisfaction
from
the
fact
that
in
this
case,
the
american
civil
liberties
union
is
on
my
side
and
also
the
united
church
of
christ
has
filed
a
brief
amicus
curiae
which
is
a
very
excellent
brief.
if
the
court
should
find
our
brief
too
long,
i
would
hope
they
would
read
that
because
it
is
a
very
fine
presentation
of
our
position.
this
case
is
the
sequel
to
the
one
just
argued
but
it's
quite
different.
it
fits
in
chronologically
but
it
comes
with
a
very
different
setting.
there
are
no
facts
in
this
case
but
there
is
a
formal
regulation
which
is
attacked
with
a
widely
scattering
shotgun.
the
federal
communications
commission
wrote
its
final
red
lion
letter
on
december
10,
1965.
shortly
thereafter,
on
april
6,
1966,
the
commission
issued
a
notice
of
proposed
rulemaking
complying
fully
with
all
of
the
requirements
of
the
administrative
procedure
act.
this
indicated
the
commission's
purpose
to
adopt
rules
with
respect
to
two
matters,
personal
attacks
and
political
editorials.
the
text
to
the
proposed
rule
was
set
forth
and
in
accordance
with
the
administrative
procedure
act
comments
were
invited
and
many
were
received.
and
the
comments
however
took
the
form
of
arguments.
there
were
some
reputations
or
some
representations
but
nothing
in
the
form
of
evidence
was
presented.
there
were
no
affidavits
or
depositions.
nor
was
any
testimony
of
witnesses
offered
or
invited
at
the
hearing.
that
isn't
the
practice
with
respect
to
hearings
on
a
proposed
rulemaking.
more
than
a
year
later,
on
july
5,
1967
and
in
that
connection
with
respect
to
findings,
i
would
like
to
call
attention
to
justice
brandeis
in
pacific
states
company
against
white.
there
is
a
lot
of
talk
in
this
case
to
the
effect
that
the
commission
didn't
make
findings
to
support
its
regulation.
but
justice
brandeis
in
that
well-known
case
said
here,
"there
is
added
reason
for
applying
the
presumption
of
validity
for
the
regulation
now
challenged
was
adapted
after
notice
and
public
hearing
as
the
statute
required.
it
is
contended
that
the
order
is
void
because
the
administrative
body
made
no
special
findings
of
fact
but
the
statute
did
not
require
special
findings
doubtless
because
the
regulation
authorized
with
general
legislation,
not
an
administrative
order
and
the
nature
of
a
judgment
directed
against
an
individual
concern.”
in
1967,
the
commission
formally
adopted
the
rules
which
had
had
proposed
with
only
slight
changes.
in
doing
so,
the
commission
issued
a
statement
saying
that
it
was
simply
a
codification
intended
to
clarify
a
portion
of
the
obligation
under
the
fairness
doctrine
which
as
i
have
indicated
in
the
previous
case
finds
its
origin
more
than
40
years
ago
and
has
been
slowly
developing
over
all
of
the
intervening
years
with
the
equal
time
provision
and
the
statute
going
back
to
1927
as
the
first
exemplification
of
it.
we
think
it
finds
specific
statutory
recognition
in
the
amendment
which
congress
adopted
to
section
315
in
1959
as
well
as
in
section
315
itself
which
is
the
equal
time
provision
which
after
all
is
simply
a
specification
of
one
application
of
the
general
fairness
concept
which
is
implicit
in
the
very
fact
of
federal
regulation
of
radio
communications.
the
regulation
which
the
commission
adopted
in
1967
has
been
twice
amended
at
both
times
to
narrow
it,
both
times
i
think
an
exercise
of
care
and
caution
by
the
commission.
on
august
7,
1967,
it
was
amended
to
exempt
bona
fide
newscast
and
on
the
spot
coverage
of
bona
fide
news
events
and
then
after
review
was
sought
in
the
court
of
appeals.
it
was
amended
again,
this
time
to
exempt
bona
fide
news
interviews
and
commentary
or
analysis
in
the
course
of
bona
fide
newscast.
the
regulation
as
finally
amended
is
set
out
on
pages
7
and
8,
the
very
last
line
on
page
6
but
on
page
7
and
8,
of
the
government's
brief
and
i
think
it
is
desirable
to
put
its
term
before
the
court
by
reading.
it
starts
with
the
heading
personal
attacks,
political
editorials.
when
during
the
presentation
of
views
on
a
controversial
issue
of
public
importance
and
attack
is
made
upon
the
honesty,
character,
integrity,
or
like
personal
qualities
of
an
identified
person
or
group,
the
licensee
shall
within
a
reasonable
time
and
in
no
event
later
than
one
week
after
the
attack
transmit
to
the
person
or
group
attacked;
(1)
notification
of
the
date
and
time
and
identification
of
the
broadcast;
(2)
a
script
or
tape
or
an
accurate
summary
of
this
or
if
a
script
or
tape
is
not
available
of
the
attack;
and
(3)
an
offer
of
a
reasonable
opportunity
to
respond
over
licensees
facilities.
(b)
the
provision
of
this
paragraph
(a)
--
of
paragraph
(a)
of
this
station
shall
not
be
applicable;
(1)
to
attacks
on
foreign
groups
or
foreign
public
figures;
(2)
to
personal
attacks
which
are
made
by
legally
qualified
candidates,
their
authorized
spokesman
or
those
associated
with
them
in
the
campaign
on
other
such
candidates,
their
authorized
spokesman
or
persons
associated
with
the
candidates
in
the
campaign
and
(3)
to
bona
fide
newscasts,
bona
fide
news
interviews
and
on
the
spot
coverage
of
a
bona
fide
news
event
including
commentary
or
analysis
contained
in
the
foregoing
programs
but
the
provisions
of
paragraph
(a)
shall
be
applicable
to
editorials
of
the
licensee.
and
then
there
is
a
note,
the
fairness
doctrine
is
applicable
to
situations
coming
within
three
above
and
then
a
specific
factual
situation
may
be
applicable
in
the
general
area
of
political
broadcast.
and
then
paragraph
(c)
where
--
paragraph
(c)
turns
to
a
new
topic,
a
personal
attack
is
close
now.
this
is
the
editorializing
portion
of
the
regulation
where
a
licensee,
in
an
editorial,
(i)
endorses
or
(ii)
opposes
a
legally
qualified
candidate
or
candidates,
the
licensee
shall,
within
24
hours
after
the
editorial,
transmit
to
respectively
(i)
the
other
qualified
candidate
or
candidates
for
the
same
office
or
(ii)
the
candidate
opposed
in
the
editorial
(1)
notification
of
the
date
and
the
time
of
the
editorial;
(2)
a
script
or
tape
of
the
editorial;
and
(3)
an
offer
of
a
reasonable
opportunity
for
a
candidate
or
a
spokesman
of
the
candidate
to
respond
over
the
licensee's
facilities.
provided,
however,
that
where
such
editorials
are
broadcast
within
72
hours
prior
to
the
day
of
the
election,
the
licensee
shall
comply
with
the
provisions
of
this
subsection
sufficiently
far
in
advance
of
the
broadcast
to
enable
the
candidate
or
candidates
to
have
a
reasonable
opportunity
to
prepare
a
response
and
to
present
it
in
a
timely
fashion.
now,
i
think
that
that
shows
that
the
commission
used
a
great
care
in
formulating
the
regulation
and
making
its
requirements
clear
to
the
broadcasters
who
are
involved.
before
i
leave
the
question
of
the
text
to
the
regulations,
i
should
refer
to
one
other
matter
when
the
final
amendment
of
the
regulation
was
issued
there
was
also
an
accompanying
memorandum
and
this
is
set
out
at
page
228
of
volume
1
on
the
appendix.
both
the
radio
news
--
radio
television
news
directors
association,
i
never
can
keep
those
initials
straight
rtnda,
and
the
columbia
broadcasting
system
make
much
in
their
briefs,
subparagraph
5
of
this
memorandum
which
is
set
out
beginning
on
page
232
and
it
is
repeatedly
said
in
particularly
in
the
columbia
broadcasting
brief
that
though
the
commission
in
its
regulation
exempted
those
several
categories
of
news
broadcast,
bona
fide
newscast,
bona
fide
news
interviews,
and
on
the
spot
coverage
of
a
bona
fide
news
event
including
commentary
or
analysis
contained
in
the
foregoing
programs
that
they
took
it
all
back
by
paragraph
5
of
this
memorandum.
and
i
suggest
without
reading
paragraph
5
now,
that
what
paragraph
5
does
is
simply
to
remind
the
stations
that
everything
they
do
is
subject
to
the
fairness
doctrine
and
even
though
these
items
in
the
news
programs
are
exempted
that
if
overall
they
have
done
a
job
which
is
not
in
the
public
interest,
that
is
a
matter
which
is
relevant
in
consideration
with
the
regulation
of
the
stations.
we
think
that
the
suggestion
in
the
columbia
broadcasting
brief
that
this
takes
back
everything
is
not
an
accurate
summary
of
it.
all
that
paragraph
5
does
is
to
say
that
the
news
programs
like
everything
else
the
broadcaster
does
remains
subject
to
the
fairness
doctrine
which
is
inherent
in
the
very
concept
of
public
regulation
of
broadcasting
and
is
implicit
in
the
grant
of
a
temporary
license
to
a
broadcaster
on
the
basis
of
public
convenience,
interest
and
necessity.
so
we
have
the
rules
which
were
adopted
by
the
commission
in
1967
with
the
two
later
modifications.
without
anything
more,
the
respondents
here
filed
petitions
for
review
of
the
orders
of
the
commission,
some
of
these
were
filed
in
the
seventh
circuit,
others
in
the
second
but
they
were
all
consolidated
by
transfer
in
the
seventh
circuit
and
that
is
the
one
decision
which
is
before
the
court.
for
a
record,
the
parties
filed
the
comments
which
have
been
filed
before
the
commission
and
the
orders
and
memoranda
of
the
commission.
there
is
a
second
volume
of
the
appendix,
appendix
volume
2
which
counsel
on
the
other
side
assures
is
a
part
of
the
record
but
i
wonder.
it
is
at
least
an
odd
sort
of
record.
it
consists
of
factual
material
not
otherwise
in
the
record
which
was
included
in
the
brief
which
was
filed
before
the
court
of
appeals.
there
was
a
motion
for
leave
to
file
this
brief
as
an
exhibit
and
this
motion
was
granted
by
a
judge
of
the
court.
i
don't
suppose
that
makes
it
a
part
of
the
record.
and
then
there
was
insistence
that
we
include
it
in
the
record
here
and
we
did
not
think
it
worth
making
an
issue
of
it.
whatever
this
material
is,
i
would
point
out
that
it
was
never
submitted
to
the
commission.
the
commission
did
not
have
the
benefit
of
whatever
value
it
may
have.
in
any
event,
almost
without
exception,
it
is
irrelevant
here
for
the
several
broadcast
recounted
would
all
or
nearly
all
be
accepted
from
the
personal
attack
rules
by
the
exceptions
which
the
commission
has
included
in
those
rules
in
an
effort
to
be
sure
that
the
burden
on
broadcasters
and
the
spontaneity
of
their
handling
of
news
programs
and
commentary
should
be
as
great
as
possible.
and
i
would
mention
too
that
the
footnotes
in
the
several
briefs
contain
references
to
program
which
have
appeared
since
the
rules
were
promulgated
and
with
no
indication
that
the
rules
are
applicable
to
this
or
that
anyone
is
seeking
to
apply
the
rules
to
them.
now,
the
whole
proceeding
puzzles
me,
no
one
has
yet
been
ordered
to
do
anything.
no
penalties
or
forfeitures
have
been
imposed.
there
are
no
specific
concrete
facts
before
the
court.
the
facts
just
float
around
and
this
morning
about
five
minutes
before
the
argument,
i
was
handed
a
transcript
of
a
broadcast
of
january
28,
1969
and
told
that
it
would
be
referred
to
in
the
argument.
i
haven't
had
a
chance
to
read
it.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
mr.
justice,
it
is
perfectly
plain
that
almost
without
exception,
nothing
in
the
appendix
is
subject
to
the
rules.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
would
like
to
know
the
facts
of
a
concrete
specific
case.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
but
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
they
don't
contend
now
mr.
justice
that
these
things
would
be
covered
by
the
present
rule.
this
is
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
sevareid
broadcast
would
not
be
covered
by
other
rule
if
they
were
included
in
a
bona
fide
news
program
as
most
of
them
are.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
--
this
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
sevareid
interview
programs
would
be
covered
and
the
one
that
was
handed
to
me
this
morning
is
a
sevareid
interview
program.
but
even
there,
i
would
like
to
know
what
the
commission
does
about
it.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
yes,
of
course
mr.
justice.
the
extent
of
the
burden
would
be
a
matter
for
consideration.
i
think
we
ought
to
have
facts
about
that
and
i
think
we
ought
to
know
what
the
types
of
programs
are.
what
the
nature
of
the
response
required
is,
what
the
burden
is
of
meeting
it.
we
have
nothing
of
that
sort
here.
the
thing
that
gives
me
great
concern
about
the
way
this
case
has
come
up
is
that
it
makes
this
great
rule.
this
bona
fide
effort
to
deal
with
the
problem
that
people
have
been
wrestling
with
for
40
years,
it
makes
us
subject
to
a
parade
of
horribles.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
they
are
entitled
to
do
a
good
deal
more
than
they
used
to
be
entitled
to.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
still
seems
to
me
that
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
this
is
a
nice
example
of
the
reason
why
in
cases
of
this
type
and
i
repeat,
i
think
this
is
rather
different
from
abbott
laboratories
which
is
a
pretty
narrow
specific
thing
in
cases
of
this
type,
where
the
validity
of
a
regulation
should
not
be
determined
in
vacuo,
should
not
be
determined
with
respect
to
any
conceivable
facts
which
is
in
effect
what
is
sought
to
be
done
by
this
and
by
bringing
in
the
january
sevareid
broadcast
but
should
be
determined
on
the
basis
of
specific
facts.
we
ought
not
to
have
to
consider
the
validity
of
this
regulation
in
terms
of
the
worst
that
can
happen
but
rather
in
terms
of
what
does
happen
in
a
particular
case.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
oh!
yes,
mr.
justice.
i
think
it's
an
element
that
even
so
i
would
like
to
have
that
developed
in
terms
of
specific
fact
that
at
the
very
least
it
seems
to
me
that
a
rule
of
this
start
shouldn't
be
simply
stricken
down
as
the
seventh
circuit
did
without
any
specific
facts
and
simply
because
the
fears
that
can
be
arouse
by
the
--
a
parade
of
the
most
difficult
cases
makes
it
apparent
that
there
are
serious
problems
here.
this
is
an
area
in
which
thoughtful
people
have
been
groping
for
answers
for
nearly
40
years
with
some
slow
but
steady
growth
and
development
over
that
period.
first,
it
was
very
general
of
the
fairness
doctrine.
then
it
was
spelled
out
in
more
detail
in
the
fairness
primer
which
is
involved
in
the
red
lion
case.
now,
the
commission
has
thought
it
wise
put
it
into
a
formal
rule.
not
because
it's
cracking
the
whip
but
because
that
is
good
administration.
that
is
the
way
to
let
the
broadcasters
know
just
what
the
commission
understands
their
responsibilities
to
be.
and
i
repeat
they
have
responsibilities
which
they
do
not
always
seem
to
recognize
in
their
briefs.
it
may
be
that
experience
in
concrete
cases
will
show
that
the
rule
needs
to
be
modified
in
this
detail
or
that.
the
lines
have
been
narrowed
but
the
commission
is
still
active
and
alert.
it
will
watch
the
situation
and
will
administer
the
rule
with
care
and
with
skill
based
on
its
experience
and
with
its
devotion
to
the
public
interest.
if
in
some
particular
case
the
commission
reaches
a
conclusion
that
goes
too
far,
there
will
always
be
opportunity
for
judicial
review
of
that
case
based
on
those
facts
and
with
the
commission
specific
ruling
on
those
facts
before
the
court.
this
is
not
our
petition
for
review.
we
do
not
seek
a
declaratory
judgment
that
this
rule
is
good
no
matter
what
but
equally
we
do
not
think
that
it
should
be
held
bad
no
matter
what,
without
any
specific
facts
and
without
any
ruling
or
interpretation
of
the
rule
by
the
commission
based
on
those
facts.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
should
not
be
judged
as
to
it's
--?
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
on
its
face.
yes,
i
think
that
is
true
mr.
justice.
i
think
that
this
is
peculiarly
the
kind
of
a
rule
and
a
situation
where
--
obviously,
is
not
careless
or
thoughtless
or
arbitrary.
it
is
obviously
been
carefully
formulated
and
where
its
validity
should
be
determined
in
terms
of
what
actually
happens
under
it
rather
than
in
terms
of
what
somebody
might
suppose
could
happen
taking
the
worst
possible
circumstances
which
come
up.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
that's
the
nature
of
the
issue
and
if
that
were
the
way
the
rule
operated,
it
would
certainly
be
a
serious
matter.
our
position
is
just
to
the
contrary
that
what
the
rule
does
is
to
promote
to
the
opportunity
of
the
public
to
hear
all
sides
and
to
have
a
vigorous,
robust
debate
which
they
will
not
have
if
the
station
can
put
out
personal
attacks
and
then
shut
up
and
then
say,
"no,
you
can't
do
anything
about
it
whether
you
pay
or
not.”
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice
that's
--
that
is
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
has
been
the
experience
under
the
fairness
doctrine.
it
has
been
the
experience
under
the
fairness
primer
with
the
only
minor
number
of
problems.
i
can't
say
that
we
really
have
any
experience
under
the
rules
because
among
other
things
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
was
the
commission's
prediction,
hope
and
expectation.
and
i
think
that
experience
over
a
long
period
shows
that
at
least
the
major
broadcasters
are
energetic,
debate
and
discussion
as
a
part
of
what
helps
them
in
the
competition
situation
and
i
find
it
difficult
to
think
that
this
rule
should
not
have
a
chance
to
show
that
it
can
promote
public
discussion
and
understanding
merely
because
in
some
special
circumstances
it
is
thought
that
it
may
present
some
problems.
this
is
not
the
first
time
that
the
broadcasting
industry
has
raised
great
threats
i
referred
already
to
the
brief
filed
by
the
office
of
communication
of
the
united
church
of
christ
and
in
the
appendix
to
that
brief,
there
is
set
out
the
introduction
to
a
pamphlet
which
was
put
out
by
the
columbia
broadcasting
system
at
the
time
the
chain
broadcasting
rules
were
before
the
court
and
they
then
put
in
the
strongest
terms
that
if
the
chain
broadcasting
rules
were
adopted,
the
public
would
lose
all
the
benefits
of
radio
and
so
on
and
it's
perfectly
plain
that
since
those
rules
were
adopted
and
approved
by
this
court
that
the
industry
and
the
public
have
both
benefited
greatly
from
them.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
if
i
have
time
when
i
get
through
the
rest
that
is
certainly
a
part
of
our
argument.
there's
never
been
a
case
like
this
before
the
court.
there
are
other
cases
and
both
sides
confine
some
useful
quotations
in
those
other
cases.
all
of
which,
however,
are
concerned
with
the
problems
somewhat
different
from
that
involved
here.
we
get
considerable
comfort
from
portions
of
this
court's
decisions
in
nelson
brothers,
university
of
georgia,
pottsville
broadcasting
and
particularly
national
broadcasting
company
against
the
united
states
and
this
are
set
out
on
pages
42
and
44
of
our
brief.
the
other
side
finds
comfort
in
mills
against
alabama
and
near
against
minnesota.
most
of
those
cases
were
newspaper
cases.
i've
already
tried
to
argue
that
it
does
not
follow
that
broadcast
regulation
is
exactly
the
same.
mills
involved
absolute
restraint
on
publication
said,
"you
can't
print
it.
it
is
not
involved
here.”
and
near
involved
restraint
in
substance
and
a
large
measure
of
control
over
future
publication
in
any
event.
but
i
would
particularly
rely
on
the
fact
that
both
cases
involved
newspapers
and
did
not
involved
any
aspect
of
the
development
of
the
consequences
of
the
fairness
doctrine
which
is
inherent
and
implicit
in
a
medium
which
uses
a
public
facility
and
is
licensed
to
do
so
under
standards
of
public
interest,
convenience
and
necessity.
it's
true
that
the
broadcasters
are
not
a
public
utility
and
congress
made
that
decision
and
i
think
rightly
in
1927.
but
they
are
a
public
facility
and
needn't
have
public
protection
and
they
have
responsibilities
arising
from
those
facts
which
are
not
shared
by
newspapers
or
others
who
communicate
through
print.
the
columbia
broadcasting
system
in
their
brief
say
that
the
fairness
doctrine
is
not
involved
in
this
case.
but
we
think
it
lies
behind
the
whole
problem.
it
is
an
aspect
of
the
fact
that
the
broadcaster
must
serve
the
public
interest
if
he
is
to
have
and
retain
a
license.
let
us
suppose
for
example
a
station
which
obtains
a
license
and
simply
does
not
operate.
surely,
its
license
will
be
revoked.
does
that
violate
the
first
amendment?
isn't
there
a
freedom
not
to
speak
as
well
as
a
freedom
to
speak?
not
i
venture
to
think
if
you
are
a
radio
or
television
licensee.
or
suppose
that
a
station
decides
that
it
will
broadcast
only
obscenity
or
only
readings
from
books
such
as
fanny
hill
which
have
been
held
to
be
protected
in
print
by
the
first
amendment.
would
such
a
station
serve
the
public
interest
within
the
federal
communication's
act?
and
would
it
violate
the
first
amendment
to
say
that
it
did
not
and
to
revoke
its
license?
or
to
refuse
to
renew
it
when
it
has
expired?
it
may
be
said
that
this
illustrations
deal
with
the
public
interest
but
not
with
fairness.
let
me
move
on
then
to
such
cases
as
the
office
of
communication
of
the
united
church
of
christ
against
the
federal
communications
commission
which
was
decided
not
long
ago
by
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
district
of
columbia
in
a
careful
and
thoughtful
opinion.
that
case
involved
a
television
station
in
jackson,
mississippi
which
it
was
alleged,
discriminated
in
many
ways
against
the
nearly
50%
of
the
persons
in
its
listening
area
who
are
negroes.
i
need
not
detail
the
discriminations,
they
can
be
readily
imagined.
anyone
at
tougaloo
college
in
the
jackson
area
was
surely
aware
of
them.
the
office
of
communications
of
the
united
church
of
christ
to
its
credit
produced
the
considerable
amount
of
money
and
energy
which
was
required
to
do
something
about
it.
the
commission
held
that
they
couldn't
intervene
but
the
commission
did
renew
the
station's
license
for
one
year
only
specifically
stated
to
be
a
trial
period
to
see
if
they
had
mended
their
ways.
on
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia,
everything
was
reversed.
the
court
held
that
the
office
of
communications
was
entitled
to
intervene
that
it
had
a
viewpoint
and
interest
which
was
relevant
in
determining
the
question
whether
the
station
was
being
operated
in
the
public
interest
and
the
court
also
held
that
the
question
of
the
renewal
of
the
license
should
be
decided
on
the
basis
of
full
hearing
and
not
on
the
basis
of
what
was
done
during
a
trial
renewal
of
one
year.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
three
years
is
the
normal
term.
the
commission
can
make
it
shorter.
it
cannot
make
it
longer
and
it
must
be
reconsidered
at
least
every
three
years.
this
hearing
has
now
been
held
and
the
commission
has
granted
a
full
renewal
after
a
full
hearing
and
the
case
is
once
more
on
its
way
to
the
court
of
appeals.
it's
also
clear
that
there
has
been
a
great
change
in
the
program
practices
of
this
station.
i
find
it
hard
to
believe
that
this
has
violated
the
first
amendment.
it
has
rather
been
a
step
toward
the
effectuation
of
the
first
amendment,
a
recognition
of
the
obligation
which
a
licensee
undertakes
when
he
is
granted
an
exclusive
right
to
utilize
a
valuable
public
facility.
the
problem
involved
in
that
case
is
i
submit
not
different
in
the
last
analysis
from
that
involved
here
in
the
development
of
the
personal
attack
rules
as
a
direct
outgrowth
and
development
from
the
fairness
doctrine
which
is
implicit
in
the
concept
of
public
regulations
of
broadcasting.
now,
i
would
like
to
point
out
and
i
think
this
is
of
great
importance
here.
the
regulation
involved
in
this
case
is
entirely
neutral
with
respect
to
the
content
of
speech.
it
applies
in
exactly
the
same
way
and
requires
the
exactly
the
same
action
from
the
broadcaster
regardless
of
what
views
are
expressed
in
the
broadcast
giving
the
right
to
the
reply.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
there
is
no
difference
between
radio
and
television.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
television
is
much
more
dominated
by
the
network.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
which
tend
to
give
it
a
broader
outlook
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
television
has
a
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
a
particular
television
station
has
a
limited
service
area
but
that
is
exactly
the
same
or
substantially
the
same
as
the
limit
of
fm
radio
stations.
am
radio
stations
can
have
a
very
wide
range
and
with
satellite
communication
and
cable
television
and
so
on
the
television
stations
are
not
as
clearly
to
be
distinguished
as
they
used
to
be.
the
government
does
not
by
this
regulation
support
any
point
of
view
except
of
course
the
central
idea
of
the
first
amendment
that
there
should
be
an
opportunity
for
all
points
of
view
to
be
heard.
an
important
corollary
of
these
regulations
is
that
they
strongly
reduce
the
incentive
for
the
government
to
select
its
broadcast
licensees
in
ways
that
might
be
difficult
to
detect
on
the
basis
of
the
political
or
other
views
that
they
are
likely
to
expressed
or
favor
in
their
broadcasting.
now,
this
too
serves
the
policies
of
the
first
amendment.
an
analogy
may
be
found
in
arguments
in
this
court.
it
has
been
my
observation
that
when
one
counsel
speaks,
there
is
always
an
opportunity
for
one
to
speak
on
the
other
side
and
exactly
the
same
amount
of
time
made
available.
and
if
as
happened
in
this
case
a
counsel
seek
to
have
the
case
taken
of
the
summary
docket
and
put
on
the
regular
docket
so
that
they
may
have
an
hour
on
the
side
then
an
hour
is
given
to
the
other
side.
this
might
be
regarded
as
inhibition
upon
his
asking
for
additional
time
for
himself.
an
inhibition
quite
comparable
to
that
complained
of
by
our
opponents
in
these
cases
except
that
it's
the
court's
time
rather
than
the
broadcaster's
time
which
is
being
consumed.
but
the
inhibition
is
obviously
justified
on
the
basis
of
considerations
of
fairness
and
of
values
reflected
in
the
first
amendment
which
favor
an
opportunity
for
both
sides
of
controversies
to
be
heard.
as
i
contended
in
the
argument
in
the
red
lion
case,
our
opponents
in
these
cases
seek
to
put
us
in
opposition
to
the
first
amendment
and
we
do
not
accept
that
position.
i
suggest
that
on
analysis,
it
is
the
government
and
the
federal
communications
commission
which
are
the
real
champions
of
the
first
amendment
here.
the
commission's
regulation
served
to
foster
important
first
amendment
values
which
our
opponents
would
have
the
court
sacrifice
in
the
guise
of
upholding
the
narrow
and
financially
motivated
claim
to
unfettered
control
of
airwaves
that
had
been
licensed
to
their
custody.
this
argument
is
i
submit
fully
supported
by
this
court's
recent
decision
in
the
citizens
publishing
company
case
decided
on
march
10.
the
court
there
quoted
from
the
associated
press
opinion
in
explaining
the
beneficial
effects
of
free
speech
in
the
application
of
antitrust
laws
to
the
communications
media
and
i
was
quite
struck
when
this
case
came
down
with
the
closeness
of
the
application
of
that
quotation
utilized
by
this
court
only
three
weeks
ago.
it
would
be
strange
indeed
if
the
grave
concern
for
freedom
of
the
press
which
prompted
adoption
of
the
first
amendment
should
be
read
as
a
command
that
the
government
was
without
power
to
protect
that
freedom.
the
first
amendment
from
providing
an
argument
against
application
of
the
sherman
act
and
here
i
would
simply
read
it
the
personal
attack
rules,
here
provides
powerful
reasons
to
the
contrary.
that
amendment
rest
on
the
assumption
that
the
widest
possible
dissemination
of
information
from
diverse
and
antagonistic
sources
is
essential
to
the
welfare
of
the
public
that
a
free
press
is
a
condition
of
a
free
society
and
there
is
more
of
the
quotation
very
much
of
which
is
relevant.
this
view
is
also
supported
by
the
venerated
conquering
opinion
of
mr.
justice
brandeis
in
whitney
against
california
which
emphasizes
the
great
reliance
upon
the
value
of
counter
argument
that
is
implicit
in
our
protection
of
free
speech
in
the
first
place.
the
realities
of
the
broadcasting
industry
have
led
the
federal
communications
commission
entirely
properly
in
our
view
to
take
the
steps
needed
in
these
regulations
to
make
the
opportunities
for
counter
argument
a
reality
in
this
important
communications
medium.
in
the
associated
press
case,
the
applicability
of
the
antitrust
laws
to
the
new
services
and
its
members
in
no
way
depended
on
the
content
of
their
new
stories.
this
was
also
true
in
the
citizens
publishing
case
this
term
to
which
i
have
just
referred.
the
restraints
of
trade
in
those
cases
would
have
been
equally
unlawful
if
all
the
editorials
and
new
stories
being
published
had
taken
the
other
point
of
view.
the
court
in
those
cases
upheld
the
government's
right
to
regulate
these
news
media
in
the
interest
of
legitimate
antitrust
objectives
in
a
context
in
which
the
regulation
was
entirely
neutral
with
respect
to
the
content
of
what
was
being
published
and
in
which
no
one
was
being
forbidden
from
publishing
anything
while
the
application
of
the
antitrust
laws
may
have
reduced
profits.
this
is
also
true
of
the
application
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act
or
the
income
tax
to
newspapers
and
broadcasters.
in
this
case,
another
communications
medium
is
being
regulated
in
pursuit
of
an
equally
valid
government
objective
and
in
--
and
again
in
a
way
that
does
not
favor
or
disfavor
any
particular
content
of
speech
and
which
does
not
forbid
the
saying
of
anything.
the
policies
of
the
first
amendment
not
only
favor
access
to
the
media
of
purveyors
of
all
points
of
view
but
the
court
has
specifically
recognized
the
first
amendment
right
in
the
recipient
or
listener
not
to
have
the
channels
of
communication
to
him
stay
so
as
to
favor
or
disfavor
a
particular
point
of
view.
this
was
established
in
the
case
of
lamont
against
the
postmaster
general
cited
at
page
75
of
our
brief
in
which
i
am
inclined
to
think
on
reflection
and
preparing
this
argument
is
perhaps
one
of
the
most
important
cases
which
lead
in
support
of
our
position
here.
it's
true
that
the
court
has
stricken
down
regulations
in
some
cases
which
were
superficially
neutral.
for
example,
the
complete
banning
of
methods
of
communication
such
as
soundtracks
or
handbills
tends
to
discriminate
against
those
espousing
unpopular
ideas
and
who
do
not
have
easy
access
to
the
commercial
communications
media.
similarly,
requirements
of
associational
disclosure
can
--
to
bring
about
burdens
on
those
associated
with
groups
that
are
unpopular
in
the
community
and
thus
to
discourage
association
with
such
groups.
much
the
same
can
be
said
about
taley
against
california
where
the
court
upheld
a
right
to
anonymity
in
the
dissemination
of
political
literature.
there
is
also
an
important
element
of
this
in
the
new
york
times
against
sullivan
line
of
cases
because
a
large
liable
verdict
tends
to
indicate
that
the
plaintiff
in
his
views
are
held
in
high
esteem
in
the
community
and
the
contrary
about
the
defendant
while
it
is
difficult
for
a
truly
unpopular
plaintiff
to
win
much
of
a
liable
verdict
against
the
popular
defendant.
yet
the
main
office
of
the
courts
under
the
first
amendment
is
the
right
to
--
is
to
protect
the
right
to
expressed
views
that
are
not
already
popular
and
accepted
in
the
community
and
i
suggest
that
that
is
the
fundamental
basis
behind
new
york
times
against
sullivan.
now,
we
come
to
the
editorializing
aspect
of
the
rules
which
is
discussed
on
pages
78
to
82
of
our
brief.
here
again,
i'm
a
little
puzzled
because
the
principal
--
some
of
the
principal
briefs
filed
in
the
case
are
filed
by
the
networks
and
the
networks
do
not
editorialize
whether
the
radio
television
news
director
association
engages
in
televising,
i
don't
know.
here
again,
we
have
no
facts,
nothing
to
indicate
that
they
do
or
do
not.
but
in
essence
the
editorializing
rules
are
much
the
same
as
the
personal
attack
rules
they
called
for
opportunity
to
reply.
they
are
an
exemplification
of
the
fairness
doctrine.
they
are
a
means
of
keeping
open
the
channels
of
communication
of
facilitating
the
objective
of
the
first
amendment
which
is
to
provide
an
opportunity
for
the
public
to
hear
and
to
learn.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
they
apply
only
with
respect
to
a
candidate,
that
is
right
and
they
do
not
--
it
does
not
apply
to
a
public
issue
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
some
control
safe
streets
and
other
things
that
people
might
want
to
discuss
about.
it
does
relate
simply
to
candidates
and
thus
provide
an
opportunity
for
candidates
to
reply
if
one
or
another
is
endorsed
in
a
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
it
might
be
very
difficult.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i'm
not
sure
whether
--
well
i
think
it
is
a
problem
when
there
are
multiple
candidates.
i
am
--
we
do
not
know
what
the
commission's
position
would
be
as
to
the
amount
of
time
which
would
be
available
for
other
candidates
and
there
are
some
times
are
i
thought
it
was
17
candidates
in
los
angeles,
and
i
think
it
is
a
very
serious
problem
and
it
may
well
be
that
the
commission
ought
to
give
further
consideration
to
that
sort
of
thing.
what
i
am
really
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
it
does
not
very
specifically
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
does
not
specify
equal
time.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
is
--
it
is
whatever
is
required
by
the
overall
scope
of
the
fairness
doctrine.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
a
reasonable
opportunity
to
respond.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
in
the
--
in
the
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
statute
of?
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
radio
act
of
1927
and
the
federal
communications
act
of
1934
do
have
the
equal
time
provision
which
allows
the
candidate
which
provides
that
if
the
station
sells
time
or
gives
time
to
a
candidate,
it
must
give
equal
time
on
the
same
terms
to
every
other
candidate
and
that
is
the
equal
time
provision
which
was
then
amended
in
1959
to
exclude
bona
fide
news
broadcast
essentially
the
same
exclusions
which
are
made
in
this
regulation.
it
was
suspended
in
the
1960
campaign
but
was
enforced
and
followed
in
1964
and
in
1968
is
it
seems
to
us
the
fundamental
recognition
by
congress
in
the
most
sensitive
area
of
the
applicability
of
the
fairness
doctrine
to
radio
and
television
broadcasting
and
it
is
with
respect
to
the
amendment
in
1959
which
accepted
news
programs
that
congress
expressly
included
a
provision
saying
that
nothing
there
should
protect
radio
and
television
stations
from
their
obligation
to
operate
in
the
public
interest
which
we
contend
is
a
legislative,
congressional
recognition
of
the
validity
in
the
application
of
the
fairness
doctrine.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
mr.
justice,
on
the
contrary
as
it
is
our
position
here,
it
is
free
to
up,
it
is
to
open
the
channels
communication
rather
than
to
control
them
or
dominate
them
or
direct
them.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
there
is
such
a
provision
in
the
federal
communications
act
today
and
we
don't
for
the
moment
concede
that
we
are
seeking
to
employ
censorship.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
there
was
then,
yes.
there
has
been
from
the
beginning.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
it
is
quite
plain
that
the
congress
for
more
than
40
years
has
not
regarded
a
requirement
of
equal
time
as
censorship.
quite
contrary,
it
is
a
freeing
of
the
channel's
communication.
we
are
fighting
for
the
first
amendment
here.
i
hate
to
yield
that
the
broadcasters
whose
interest
may
not
be
as
broad
as
ours.
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
may
it
please
the
court.
my
friend,
professor
cox,
if
i
may
call
him
--
well
i've
known
him
long
as
brought
before
you
as
i
knew
he
would
the
extracts
from
eric
sevareid's
broadcast
which
are
in
the
volume
2
of
the
appendix
and
the
excerpt
from
“face
the
nation.”
after
the
luncheon
recess,
he
has
pointed
out
to
you
that
neither
one
would
be
affected
in
any
way
by
this
regulation
that
they
are
both
expressly
exempted
by
the
terms
of
the
regulation.
the
first
one
which
relating
to
the
death
of
henry
luce
did
not
strike
me
as
being
an
attack
but
rather
as
fair
comment
but
it
would
be
exempt
in
any
event
because
it
came
in
a
bona
fide
newscast
and
the
“face
the
nation”
program
is
exempt
because
it
was
a
bona
fide
interview.
now,
those
terms
are
words
of
art
in
the
broadcasting
industry.
the
members
of
the
industry
know
what
they
mean.
these
terms
are
exactly
the
same
as
those
under
section
315
and
there
is
a
section
315
primer
which
spells
them
out.
i
might
point
out
that
under
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
“face
the
nation”
program
would
be
covered
by
the
news
interview
exception.
the
hoffer
program
is
not.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
is
a
conversation,
not
a
part
of
what
comes
within
in
bona
fide
news
interview.
mr.
cox
said
that
he
couldn't
understand
the
distinction
but
the
distinction
which
the
commission
endeavored
to
work
out
was
one
with
respect
to
timing
when
you
have
to
move
fast
and
have
to
get
in
on
the
news
program
including
commentary,
you
are
free
from
this
although
you're
subject
the
fairness
rules
and
documentaries
and
then
a
program
like
the
interview
with
hoffer
which
after
all
was
taped
and
probably
done
days
before
it
was
broadcast.
there
is
plenty
of
opportunity
to
consider
thoughtfully
and
rationally
what
should
be
done
about
it.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
is
a
news
interview
and
is
exempt
under
the
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no
but
it
is
the
type
of
thing
where
you
bring
in
somebody
and
it
is
spontaneous
and
the
station
can't
plan
in
advance
and
doesn't
know
what's
going
to
appear.
at
any
rate,
it
is
exempt
under
this
regulation?
there
is
no
question
about
that.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
there
are
not
in
this
regulation
but
i
understand
that
they
are
in
the
section
315
primer
which
does
summarize
the
commission's
rules
with
respect
to
the
meaning
of
that
terminology
and
i
don't
understand
that
the
other
side
to
questions
that.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
not
--
not
quite.
they
are
subject
to
the
fairness
doctrine
which
requires
that
overall
they
must
have
a
balanced
program.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
didn't
understand
mr.
cox
is
saying
that
and
if
he
did
it
goes
beyond
anything
that
i
understand
the
regulations
to
require.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
if
--
paragraph
5
does
impose
the
standard
of
the
fairness
doctrine
but
does
not
require
a
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
personal
attack
rule.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
i
think
that
is
the
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
personal
attack
rule
does
require
that
a
particular
person
attack
to
have
an
opportunity
to
respond.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
there
something
close
to
that
in
this
paragraph
5
but
it
is
not
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
is
not
what
you
said
--
what
was
said
before.
the
top
of
page
233
of
the
record
does
our
revision
affords
the
licensee
considerable
leeway
in
this
news
type
program
but
it
still
requires
that
fairness
be
met
either
by
the
licensee's
action
of
fairly
presenting
the
contrasting
viewpoint
on
the
attack
issue
which
he
can
do
in
any
way
he
want
but
it
must
be
fair
or
by
notifying
and
allowing
the
person
or
group
attack
a
reasonable
opportunity
to
respond.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no
matter
is
an
alternative,
one
or
two
ways
he
can
do
it.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
i
think
that's
a
harder
question
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
that
--
that
he
is
--
we
come
close
to
it
under
the
fairness
doctrine.
he
is
required
to
be
fair
and
if
he
doesn't
provide
fairness
through
some
other
spokesman,
i
think
he
is
under
some
obligation
to
provide
the
fairness
himself
but
i
find
it,
i
shrink
somewhat
obviously.
this
is
as
settle
and
slippery
case,
all
the
way
through
and
i
shrink
from
being
caught
in
a
place
where
i
say
that
he
must
say
something.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
that
is
certainly
one
of
escape
patches
where
ate
least
there
is
nothing
in
this
regulation
now
which
requires
that
action.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
he
is
never
so
required
and
he
has
never
required
to
broadcasts
the
government
release
which
is
prepared
for
him.
there
is
no
requirement
as
to
the
specific
speech.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
at
one
time
we're
told
that
the
rules
are
vague
and
we
don't
know
how
to
comply
with
him.
at
another
time
we're
told
that
they
are
arbitrary.
there
is
only
one
thing
you
can
do.
you
must
have
the
person
attacked
into
respond.
the
commission
has
said
that
the
rule
will
not
be
used
as
a
basis
for
sanctions
against
those
licensee
who
in
good
faith
seek
to
comply
with
the
personal
attack
principle
and
in
a
case
decided
within
the
past
year
arising
under
the
rules,
the
commission
said
that
there
was
no
question
of
imposing
a
forfeiture
under
circumstances
of
this
case
where
the
station
has
made
a
good
faith
judgment
and
has
actually
do
not
reflect
the
flagrant
clear
cut
case
of
violation
for
which
we
stated
we
would
consider
in
position
of
a
forfeiture.
incidentally,
the
commission
has
also
stated
in
a
case
decided
within
the
past
few
months
that
the
commission's
experience
over
the
years
of
operation
in
this
area
that
there
has
been
no
indication
of
inhibition
or
robust
debate
by
our
fairness
policies.
indeed,
such
debate
has
been
increasing
not
declining
during
the
last
seven
years
when
the
personal
attack
principle
was
being
developed
and
brought
specifically
the
notice
of
all
licensee
that's
the
story
of
broadcasting
case
and
i
would
like
to
close
simply
with
a
reference
to
the
anti-defamation
league
case
which
is
cited
in
the
briefs
into
which
reference
was
made
by
mr.
cox.
that
is
the
case
where
a
station
broadcast
anti-semitic
material.
the
fact
was
that
on
complaint,
the
station
offered
the
anti-semitic
league
an
opportunity
to
reply
and
they
declined
that
opportunity.
they
said
we
don't
want
to
reply,
we
want
your
licensee
revoked
and
the
proceeding
was
heard
before
the
commission
and
the
commission
determined
that
on
overall
balance
they
had
given
an
opportunity
for
a
response
and
by
other
things
they
had
done.
they
had
complied
with
the
fairness
rule
and
that
was
sustained
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
this
court
denies
certiorari
just
recently.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
mr.
justice
that
you
can
pass
on
the
question
whether
the
commission
as
part
of
issues
some
kind
of
a
regulation.
i
would
think
it
will
be
very
unfortunate
for
the
court
to
hold
in
this
case
on
this
record
that
the
commission
has
no
such
power.
i
can
well
understand
the
court's
holding
that
we
don't
think
this
necessarily
is
the
last
word
and
that
as
cases
come
up
we
may
need
to
consider
it.
we
have
a
parallel
with
respect
to
unfair
labor
practice
which
i
think
is
no
more
vague
than
the
statement
in
this
personal
attack
rule.
unfair
labor
practice
occasionally
impinges
on
the
area
of
freedom
of
speech
and
the
fact
that
what
a
person
says
may
be
an
unfair
labor
practice
undoubtedly
has
some
inhibitory
effect
but
the
way
that
has
been
worked
out
is
through
the
years
cases
come
up
in
which
particular
facts
appeared
and
somebody
said
something
under
certain
circumstances
and
the
court
decided
whether
or
not
it
was
an
unfair
labor
practice.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
what
ought
to
be
done
here,
that
it
ought
to
be
left
for
the
working
out
of
the
mind
through
the
process
of
gradual
adjudication
in
which
it
will
be
determined
whether
under
certain
circumstances,
certain
statements
were
personal
attacks
and
whether
the
action
of
the
commission
in
response
thereto
was
an
appropriate
action
under
those
circumstances.
