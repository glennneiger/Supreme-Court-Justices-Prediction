mr.
roger
robb
may
it
please
the
court,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
facts
in
this
case
may
be
briefly
stated.
in
1964,
the
petitioner
red
lion
broadcasts
a
15-minute
program
by
one
billy
james
hargis,
in
which
mr.
hargis
attacked
mr.
fred
j.
cook
in
connection
with
a
book
that
mr.
cook
had
written.
the
hargis
talk
was
part
of
a
series
and
was
carried
on
a
number
of
other
radio
stations
and
red
lion
was
paid
for
the
time.
having
learned
of
the
attack,
mr.
cook
wrote
to
red
lion
invoking
the
so-called
personal
attack
doctrine
of
the
federal
communications
commission
and
demanding
that
he
be
given
time
to
reply.
in
response,
red
lion
offered
to
make
time
available
to
mr.
cook
at
the
station's
regular
rate,
or
to
give
mr.
cook
free
time
if
he
stated
that
he
would
--
that
he
could
not
pay
for
time.
mr.
cook
rejected
the
offer
of
time
on
a
paid
basis
and
refused
to
state
that
he
could
not
pay
for
time.
and
he
complained
to
the
federal
communications
commission
that
red
lion
was
in
violation
of
the
so-called
personal
attack
doctrine.
the
commission
ruled
that
having
presented
a
personal
attack
on
an
individual
and
his
honesty,
character
or
integrity
in
connection
with
a
controversial
matter
of
public
importance,
red
lion
was
bound
by
the
personal
attack
rule
and
doctrine.
to
inform
mr.
cook,
the
individual
involved
of
the
attack,
to
send
him
a
tape
or
a
transcript
or
a
summary
of
the
broadcast,
and
upon
his
demand
to
afford
him
free
time
to
reply.
the
commission
held
that
that
mr.
cook
was
under
no
obligation
to
make
any
showing
of
inability
to
pay.
red
lion
was
directed
it
to
comply
with
this
ruling.
red
lion
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
this
circuit
which
stay
in
the
commission's
ruling
and
this
court
thereafter
granted
certiorari.
i
might
interpolate
that
as
this
court
has
recognized,
this
case
is
a
companion
case
and
closely
involved
with
the
next
case
number
717,
that
the
red
lion
situation
involve
a
specific
application
of
the
rule
involved
in
number
717.
in
the
interest
of
clarity,
might
be
helpful
to
the
outset
to
suggest
certain
matters
which
i
conceive
are
not
in
issue
here.
first,
there
is
no
question
but
that
the
hargis
broadcast
contained
a
personal
attack
on
mr.
cook
within
the
meaning
of
the
definition
of
the
f.c.c.
second,
there
is
no
issue
as
to
the
truth
or
falsity
of
the
hargis
broadcast
or
after
the
good
faith
of
hargis
in
making
it
or
the
good
faith
of
red
lion
in
broadcasting
it.
the
ruling
of
the
commission
and
the
opinion
of
the
court
below
make
it
clear
that
these
matters
where
held
to
be
immaterial.
in
other
words,
red
lion
was
bound
to
comply
with
the
commission's
order
whether
the
broadcast
was
true
or
false,
and
whether
the
broadcaster
carried
it
believing
it
to
true
or
not.
third
and
obviously,
there
is
no
issue
here
as
to
whether
mr.
hargis
and
his
philosophy
about
mr.
cook
and
his
are
worthy
or
unworthy.
the
issue
is
simply
one
of
law
without
regard
to
the
personal
beliefs
or
philosophies
of
the
individuals
involved,
where
otherwise,
i
might
not
be
here.
fourth,
it
is
conceded
i
believe
by
the
government
perhaps
with
some
qualifications
that
radio
and
television
are
part
of
the
press
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
now,
i'm
informed
that
mr.
cox
in
number
17-717
will
discuss
rather
fully
of
the
statutory
questions
involved
here.
i
would
like,
if
i
might,
to
focus
briefly
upon
the
constitutional
question.
simply
stated
the
issue
here
i
suggest
is
whether
or
not
the
order
of
the
federal
communications
commission
to
red
lion
imposes
a
burden
of
previous
restraint
upon
free
speech
in
the
press
which
is
forbidden
by
the
first
amendment.
does
this
order
imposed
on
red
lion
a
burden?
we
submit
that
obviously
it
does.
the
burden
consists
of
the
cost
of
preparing
a
tape
or
a
transcript,
of
sending
it
to
the
individual
attacked
and
providing
free
time,
and
perhaps
and
i
emphasize
this,
perhaps
providing
free
time
by
displacing
some
other
program
which
is
paid
for.
this
as
i
understand
the
government's
brief,
they
concede
that
a
burden
is
imposed,
but
they
assert
somewhat
blandly
i
think
that
the
cost
is
not
substantial
and
the
burden
is
not
undo.
and
likewise
judge
tamm
thought
that
such
a
burden
was
not
unreasonable.
now
in
general,
we
challenge
the
proposition
that
the
exercise
of
first
amendment
rights
maybe
burdened
with
the
financial
penalty
so
long
as
the
government
or
the
federal
communications
commission
thinks
the
amount
of
the
penalty
is
reasonable.
we
ask
what
standard
does
the
government
apply
to
determine
what
is
reasonable
and
what
is
not.
would
the
government
say
that
a
large
chicago
television
station
which
is
required
to
donate
15
minutes
of
time
for
which
a
commercial
sponsor
would
be
charged
$2,000.00?
would
the
government
say
that
that
station
is
not
subjected
to
an
unreasonable
and
honorous
burden.
we
submit
that
the
commandment
of
the
first
amendment
is
simply
"thou
shall
not
abridge"
and
it
is
not
"you
may
abridge
but
please
try
to
keep
it
reasonable."
in
any
event,
the
impact
of
a
financial
penalty
and
the
threat
of
future
penalties
are
serious
matters
for
red
lion
broadcasting
company.
this
station
is
located
in
the
city
of
red
lion,
pennsylvania
which
is
a
small
town,
having
a
population
of
less
than
6,000.
as
the
record
discloses,
it
is
a
daytime
only
station
which
must
compete
for
revenues
with
two
fulltime
and
one
daytime
station
located
in
the
york,
pennsylvania,
and
a
fulltime
station
hanover,
pennsylvania.
york,
the
county
seat
with
the
population
of
some
55,000
is
only
six
miles
away.
hanover
is
18
miles
away.
there
for
a
small
station
facing
such
competition,
any
donation
of
free
time
as
a
practical
matter
is
not
a
trivial
concern,
and
repeated
donations
might
very
well
drive
the
station
out
of
existence.
mr.
roger
robb
does
your
honor
referred
by
the
other
burdens
to
the
--
well
i
think
--
mr.
roger
robb
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
roger
robb
yes,
yes
indeed,
that
of
course
is
a
burden
issue.
mr.
roger
robb
yes
sir.
mr.
roger
robb
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
but
i
think
we
have
to
consider
in
analyzing
the
effect
of
this
order
for
regulation,
consider
the
entire
impact
that
went
on
the
station
and
the
disruption
of
programming
for
station
is
a
very
serious
matter,
specially
--
mr.
roger
robb
yes
sir.
the
record
shows
mr.
justice
marshall
that
this
station
carries
one
hour
a
day
called
free
speech
and
that
on
this
program,
anyone
who
wishes
to
appear
may
appear.
i
don't
know
whether
mr.
cook
would
insist
the
station
to
pay
his
expenses
to
get
there
or
not.
that
might
be
the
possibility.
now,
i
mentioned
the
possibility
of
repeated
request
for
donations.
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
rule
of
the
f.c.c.
in
this
case
would
expose
the
station
to
repeated
demands
for
free
time,
unless
the
station
steered
clear
of
the
dangerous
zone
of
personal
attack.
this
very
broadcast
is
a
good
illustration
of
this
proposition.
the
broadcast
is
printed
at
pages
60
and
61
of
the
appendix
and
appears
therein
at
this
one
broadcast
contained
attacks
not
only
on
mr.
cook
but
on
three
other
people
or
groups.
mr.
hargis
attacked
a
man
named
eugene
gleason,
whom
he
identified
as
mr.
cook's
pal.
he
attacked
the
magazine,
the
nation.
he
attacked
mr.
carry
mcwilliams,
the
editor
of
the
nation.
now,
if
red
lion
were
oblige
to
devote
time
for
a
reply
to
each
of
these
attacks,
would
the
government
then
say
that
the
cost
and
the
disruption
of
the
station's
business
where
insubstantial?
now,
i
suggest
that
this
broadcast
furthermore
is
a
striking
example
of
the
fact
that
the
personal
attack
doctrine
as
applied
by
the
commission
fragments
every
discussion
of
a
controversial
matter
of
public
interest
and
importance,
in
due
has
many
separate
controversies
and
issues
as
there
happened
to
be
individuals
or
groups
who
happen
to
be
attacked
in
the
course
of
the
broadcast.
now,
if
the
speaker
happens
to
speak
critically
for
a
dozen
individuals,
each
of
them
thereby
becomes
instantly
a
controversial
matter
or
issue
of
public
importance,
and
the
broadcaster
maybe
required
to
provide
free
time
for
a
dozen
of
answers
which
would
be
an
onerous
burden
indeed.
we
think
this
threat
is
substantial.
we
think
of
the
words
of
this
court
in
cantwell
against
connecticut
in
which
the
court
said
this,
“it
is
not
merely
the
sporadic
abused
of
power
by
the
censor,
but
the
pervasive
threat
inherent
in
this
very
existence
that
constitutes
the
danger
to
freedom
of
discussion”.
we
asked,
can
it
be
set
that
the
financial
penalties
and
the
other
burdens
which
are
--
and
the
penalties
incidentally
have
the
effect
of
a
fine,
and
the
persuasive
and
the
pervasive
threat
of
similar
penalties
in
the
future
do
not
and
could
not
have
a
chilling
and
deterrent
effect
upon
the
exercise
by
red
lion
of
his
first
amendment
rights.
do
these
penalties
and
burdens
and
this
threat
for
the
future
constitute
an
inhibition
and
a
deterrent
less
substantial
than
the
one
struck
by
--
the
ones
that
was
struck
down
by
this
court
in
talley
against
california
and
speiser
against
randall?
we
submit
that
the
answer
must
be
no.
we
submit
the
common
sense
tells
us
plainly
that
the
application
of
the
commission's
rule
and
the
threat
of
future
applications
are
bound
to
make
red
lion
in
the
future
more
reluctant
to
broadcast
any
material
that
involve
the
criticism
of
any
individual
or
group.
undoubtedly,
we
submit,
red
lion
in
the
future
would
tread
more
cautiously,
steering
wider
of
the
dangerous
zone
of
criticism.
the
result
will
be
self-censorship,
nonetheless
virulent
for
having
been
self
imposed.
now,
the
government
argues
that
the
personal
attack
rule
is
necessary
in
order
that
the
public
may
have
both
sides
of
controversial
issues,
and
specifically
so
the
public
may
hear
both
the
attack
and
the
answer.
the
argument
we
suggest
overlooks
the
fact
that
if
the
personal
attack
rule
is
sustained,
the
public
is
likely
to
hear
neither
the
attack
nor
the
answer,
for
the
reason
that
the
attack
may
never
be
broadcast
at
all.
instead
of
stimulating
wide
open,
robust
and
uninhibited
debate,
the
rule
will
tend
to
choke
it
off
at
the
source.
to
prevent
the
introduction
of
any
alleged
impurity
into
the
stream,
the
government
proposes
to
dry
it
up
at
its
source.
now,
the
government
argues
further
that
a
person
attacked
on
a
number
of
radio
stations
maybe
financially
unable
to
pay
for
time
on
them
all.
therefore,
says
the
government,
it's
right
that
he
should
be
given
free
time.
one
answer
to
this
argument
may
be
found
we
think
in
the
language
of
this
court
in
cantwell
against
connecticut,
where
the
court
said
and
i
quote,
“to
persuade
others
to
his
own
point
of
view,
the
pleader
as
we
know
at
times
resort
to
exaggeration,
to
vilification
of
man
who
have
been
or
are
prominent
in
church
or
state,
and
even
to
false
statement,
but
the
people
of
this
nation
have
ordained
in
the
light
of
history
that
in
spite
of
the
probability
of
excesses
and
abuses,
these
liberties
are
in
the
long
run
essential
to
enlighten
opinion
and
right
conduct
on
the
bottom
citizens
of
a
democracy.”
we
submit
in
this
case
that
the
possibility
of
isolated
abuses
and
individual
cases
of
such
abuses
cannot
justify
the
imposition
of
a
stifling
blanket
of
restraint
on
the
first
amendment
rights
of
all
broadcasting
stations.
now,
the
government's
argument
when
analyzed
rests
on
the
premise
that
those
who
listened
and
who
listened
--
listen
to
the
programs
of
red
lion
have
no
other
source
of
information,
no
access
to
a
wide
diversity
of
opinion.
the
facts
destroyed
the
underpinning
of
the
argument.
according
to
the
broadcasting
yearbook
and
tv
digest
fact
book
for
1969,
the
regions
of
the
city
of
red
lion
have
access
to
radio
programs
broadcast
from
nine
towns
or
cities,
which
are
hanover,
pennsylvania,
harrisburg,
carlyle,
elizabeth
town,
lancaster,
lebanon,
york,
philadelphia
and
baltimore.
they
have
access
to
television
programs
from
five
different
cities,
namely
lancaster,
lebanon,
harrisburg,
york
and
baltimore.
it
is
inconceivable
that
the
listening
audience
of
red
lion
remains
glued
to
that
station's
frequency,
isolated
and
insulated
from
all
other
sources
of
information
and
opinion.
the
possibility
of
a
failure
of
diversity
of
tongues
and
diversity
of
opinion,
we
submit
is
most
remote.
again,
the
government
relies
upon
the
fact
that
this
court
held
in
the
national
broadcasting
company
case
that
radio
broadcasting
is
subject
to
regulation.
we
agree.
it
did
hold
that.
but
it
does
not
follow
from
that
decision
and
that
the
government
may
dictate
the
content
of
radio
programs
or
impose
burdens
on
the
exercise
of
first
amendment
rights.
the
government
may
assign
frequencies
and
channels,
giving
consideration
to
the
character
and
the
financial
standing
and
ability
of
an
applicant.
it
may
evaluate
the
total
performance
of
a
broadcaster
during
the
term
of
his
license.
it
may
supervise
the
methods
of
competition
adopted
by
broadcasters.
but
all
of
such
regulation,
we
submit,
is
a
far
cry
from
the
order
to
red
lion
which
dictates
what
the
content
of
a
particular
program
shall
be
and
who
the
speaker
shall
be.
eventhough
red
lion
may
have
been
fair,
may
have
broadcast
other
points
of
view,
red
lion
is
told
by
the
commission,
you
must
put
on
mr.
cook,
you
must
give
him
time.
an
order
of
this
sort,
we
submit,
is
precisely
the
kind
of
censorship
and
abridgement
that
the
first
amendment
condemns.
now,
as
this
court
has
consistently
held
when
first
amendment
rights
are
tangled
with
conduct,
which
the
government
may
regulate,
the
first
amendment
rights
must
be
preserved
and
they
must
not
be
curtailed
by
regulation
directed
at
the
abuses
which
are
subject
to
government
control.
where
if
not
so,
then
freedom
of
speech
in
the
press
would
always
be
subject
to
abridgement
and
control
by
the
subtle
and
indirect
method
of
associating
them
and
their
exercise
with
other
conduct
which
might
be
controlled.
finally,
the
government
seeks
comfort
from
the
fact
that
the
number
of
radio
frequencies
is
limited.
it
follows
we
are
told
that
broadcasters
hold
these
frequencies
in
trust
with
the
public,
and
they
must
therefore
bow
to
the
interest
of
the
public
as
that
maybe
interpreted
and
defined
by
the
commission.
but
the
public
streets,
the
public
parks,
the
public
buildings
are
likewise
held
in
trust
for
the
public,
yet
this
court
has
not
permitted
that
fact
to
justify
restraints
upon
the
exercise
therein
of
first
amendment
rights.
in
any
event,
we
submit
that
the
first
amendment
rights
of
radio
broadcasters
should
not
be
conditioned
on
the
number
of
radio
stations
in
existence,
whether
there
be
few
or
many
should
not
determine
whether
they
should
enjoy
the
protection
and
the
full
protection
of
the
first
amendment.
finally,
if
the
number
and
diversity
of
tongues
are
factors
to
be
considered,
we
point
to
the
fact
that
there
are
more
than
6,000
commercial
radio
stations
in
this
country
today,
three
and
a
half
times
as
many
radio
stations
as
there
are
daily
newspapers.
and
we've
urged
you
to
say
that
the
circulation
and
the
listening
public
of
those
radio
stations
far
exceeds
the
circulation
and
the
reading
public
of
daily
newspapers.
now,
a
word
aired
to
the
government's
argument
that
the
personal
attack
doctrine
is
authorized
by
statute,
specifically
section
315
and
other
sections
of
the
communications
act.
mr.
cox
as
i
am
reliably
informed
will
discuss
this
matter
in
his
argument,
we
have
mentioned
it
in
our
brief,
we
support
and
adopt
mr.
cox's
argument.
we
make
these
points
very
briefly
stated.
the
first
place,
the
statute
definingly
functions,
powers
and
duties
of
the
federal
communications
commission
certainly
does
not
in
terms
authorize
the
personal
attack
rule.
certainly,
we
say
that
meddling
with
the
control
of
the
programs
or
the
content
of
programs
is
no
part
of
the
federal
communications
commission's
function.
we
suggest
furthermore
that
a
statute
which
purports
or
is
claimed
to
authorize
impingement
upon
first
amendment
rights
must
be
strictly
construed
and
carefully
examined.
it
should
not
be
broadly
construed.
with
respect
to
the
argument
that
the
1959
amendment
to
section
315
(a)
authorized
the
personal
attack
rule,
we
point
out
that
that
amendment
was
adopted
three
years
before
the
personal
attack
rule
was
articulated
by
the
federal
communications
commission.
and
therefore,
it
seemed
somewhat
difficult
to
conclude
that
the
congress
intended
in
terms
to
refer
to
that
rule
and
to
authorize
it.
we
point
out
and
suggest
also
that
the
purpose
of
the
1959
amendment
was
to
cure
a
blackout
which
had
been
caused
by
a
free
time
requirement,
and
therefore,
it
seemed
somewhat
anomalous
to
argue
that
congress
intended
by
this
curative
amendment
to
authorize
a
similar
blackout
caused
by
a
free
time
requirement.
of
course,
we
say
also
that
if
the
statute
does
purport
to
authorize
any
such
action
by
the
commission,
the
statute
is
pro
tanto
unconstitutional.
in
conclusion,
we
submit
that
this
case
plainly
demonstrates
the
wisdom
of
what
this
court
said
in
roth
against
united
states
and
repeated
in
smith
against
california.
the
court
said
and
i
quote,
“the
fundamental
freedoms
of
speech
and
press
have
contributed
greatly
to
the
development
and
well
being
of
our
free
society,
and
though
indispensable
to
its
continued
growth,
ceaseless
vigilance
is
the
watchword
to
prevent
the
erosion
by
congress
or
by
the
states.
the
door
barring
federal
and
state
intrusion
into
this
area
cannot
be
left
to
chart.
it
must
be
kept
tightly
closed
and
opened
only
the
slightest
crack
necessary
to
prevent
encroachment
upon
more
important
interest."
mr.
roger
robb
yes
sir.
mr.
roger
robb
mr.
justice
white,
i
read
those
new
rules
and
to
tell
you
the
truth,
i'm
not
sure
what
the
answer
would
be
because
i
know
those
rules
exclude
regular
news
programs
from
the
coverage
of
personal
attack
doctrine.
but
whether
this
would
be
construed
is
could
be
confused
a
news
program,
i
really
don't
know.
mr.
roger
robb
yes
sir.
mr.
roger
robb
yes
sir.
mr.
roger
robb
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
mr.
roger
robb
well,
that
i
think
involves
the
so-called
editorializing
rule
which
is
involves
in
717.
i
prefer
to
leave
that
question
to
the
experts
your
honor.
i'm
--
but
i
suppose
so,
but
of
course,
they
wouldn't
get
paid
for
that
--
mr.
roger
robb
yes
sir.
mr.
roger
robb
yes
sir.
mr.
roger
robb
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
roger
robb
yes
sir.
and
we
submit
in
conclusion
that
the
personal
attack
doctrine
applied
here
is
an
attempt
to
try
to
open
the
door,
barring
intrusions
on
first
amendment
rights.
mr.
roger
robb
yes
sir.
mr.
roger
robb
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
roger
robb
well,
--
mr.
roger
robb
yes
sir.
mr.
roger
robb
i
don't
think
it
is
your
honor.
i
think
it's
a
very
serious
one.
mr.
roger
robb
i
think
it's
a
very
serious
one.
i
think
this
is
an
attempt
--
mr.
roger
robb
i
think
this
--
mr.
roger
robb
well,
my
feeling
when
i
read
that
was
your
honor
that
this
that
we
have
before
us
here
attempt
to
pry
this
door
wide
open,
and
i
think
we
should
stop
it.
mr.
roger
robb
well,
my
personal
opinion
your
honor
is
that
you
don't
balance
first
amendment
rights,
it's
either
you
have
them
or
you
don't.
and
as
i
say,
i
don't
think
that
the
first
amendment
says
you
can
abridge
just
a
little
bit
of
reason,
i
think
the
first
amendment
says
you
can
abridge,
and
i
think
that
this
an
attempt
to
abridge.
i
think
your
honor
has
written
some
opinions
taken
that
position
if
i'm
not
mistaken.
mr.
roger
robb
yes
sir,
i
hope
so.
i
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
if
i
may
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
roger
robb
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
referring
briefly
to
the
statement
by
the
solicitor
general
concerning
whether
or
not
this
was
a
final
order
for
which
i
thank
him,
i
think
that
perhaps
i
might
pledge
that
out
a
little
bit
by
reference
to
the
records.
now,
as
has
been
indicated,
when
this
case
was
first
presented
in
the
court
of
appeals
to
a
panel
consisting
of
circuit
judges
miller,
fahy
and
tamm,
the
question
was
raised
as
to
whether
or
not
the
order
involved
was
a
final
order.
at
that
time,
the
respondent
commission
was
represented
by
mr.
giller
his
general
counsel
and
by
mr.
assistance
attorney
general
turner
of
the
department
of
justice.
judge
miller
in
his
opinion
said
this
in
which
appeared
at
page
84
of
the
joint
appendix.
in
considering
this
matter,
we
are
confronted
by
the
threshold
question,
whether
the
commission's
letters
of
october
6
and
december
9
were
final
orders
from
which
an
appeal
maybe
taken.
pursuant
to
our
invitation,
the
parties
have
submitted
memoranda
on
the
question
in
which
they
agreed
that
the
commission's
letters
constitute
final
appealable
orders.
however,
judge
miller
and
judge
tamm
held
that
the
orders
were
not
finally
appealable.
judge
fehy
dissented
in
which
he
said,
“all
parties
including
the
one
against
whom
the
ruling
was
made,
understood
the
commission
had
decided
finally
that
red
lion
was
under
obligation
to
comply
with
the
fairness
doctrine
and
had
so
notified
the
red
lion.”
thereafter,
there
was
a
motion
for
a
rehearing
en
banc,
in
which
again,
the
respondent
was
represented
by
mr.
turner
of
department
of
justice,
and
as
judge
tamm
points
out
in
his
opinion,
final
opinion,
thereafter,
the
united
states
and
the
federal
communications
commission
petition
for
en
banc
rehearing
of
the
case.
in
other
words,
at
mr.
--
as
had
been
pointed
out,
all
parties
joined
in
that
petition
and
i
note
in
the
brief
for
the
government
filed
here
at
page
9,
appears
the
statement.
number
2
here
and
after
red
lion
involves
a
challenge
to
a
1965
commission
order
directing
red
lion
broadcasting
company
inc.
licensee
of
radio
station
wgcb
in
red
lion
to
afford
time
to
fred
j.
cook.
so,
i
take
it
there
can
be
no
question,
so
far
as
the
government
is
concerned,
this
is
a
final
appealable
order.
now,
mr.
griswold
has
made
reference
to
the
distinction
what
he
argues
between
newspapers
and
radio
in
the
matter
of
regulation.
and
he
suggest
that
since
radio
is
subject
to
some
regulation,
therefore,
should
be
distinguished
from
the
case
of
newspapers.
we
suggest
that
newspapers
are
also
subject
to
the
law.
they're
subject
to
the
antitrust
laws.
they're
subject
to
the
obscenity
laws
perhaps
to
a
certain
degree.
but
that
does
not
mean
that
the
government
may
dictate
what
maybe
publish
or
what
not
maybe
publish.
the
newspapers
enjoy
the
privilege
of
law
postal
rights
as
do
periodicals,
but
this
court
has
held
in
the
hannegan
v.
esquire
case
that
the
fact
that
these
rates
are
granted
to
publications
as
a
privilege,
does
not
authorize
the
government
to
determine
what
is
in
the
public
interest
to
be
mailed
and
what
is
not.
now,
let
me
advert
briefly
in
connection
with
newspapers
and
news
stories
to
the
question
put
to
me
yesterday
by
mr.
justice
white,
and
which
perhaps
at
the
time,
i
failed
to
understand
fully
or
misunderstood.
the
question
as
i
recall
it
was
whether
or
not
this
hargis
broadcast
might
have
been
carried
as
a
bonafide
newscast,
and
therefore
have
avoided
the
requirement
that
free
time
be
given
for
a
reply.
i
think
in
the
first
place
is
if
one
examines
this
broadcast
that
one
must
reach
a
conclusion
that
under
no
stretch
of
the
imagination
could
this
be
considered
a
bonafide
news
broadcast.
it
is
a
discussion
and
an
attack
on
mr.
cook
and
his
book.
however,
and
this
matter
is
discussed
at
some
length
in
the
brief
filed
in
number
717
by
columbia
broadcasting
system.
however,
in
the
first
place,
under
the
fairness
doctrine
or
the
personal
attack
doctrine
as
it
stand
stood
the
time
of
the
broadcast,
there
was
no
exemption
for
a
personal
attack
carried
in
a
news
broadcast.
mr.
roger
robb
yes
sir,
but
even
under
current
rules,
may
it
please
the
court,
even
under
the
current
rules,
and
the
current
rule
is
published
at
page
20,
printed
at
page
20
of
the
cbs
print.
mr.
roger
robb
it
is
still
subject
to
the
fairness
doctrine
unless,
unless
the
broadcaster
carry
some
general
answer
to
the
attack
in
some
other
way.
mr.
roger
robb
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
mr.
roger
robb
yes
sir.
and
as
the
seventh
circuit
held
in
the
other
case,
our
reading
of
the
latest
amendment
indicates
that
unless
the
response
of
the
person
attacked
is
fairly
prevented
by
the
licensee
on
the
attack
issue
of
the
exempt
broadcast,
the
licensee,
he
must
adhere
to
the
explicit
requirements
of
the
rules,
so
that
the
exception
is
really
rather
--
a
rather
insubstantial.
now,
--
mr.
roger
robb
well,
--
mr.
roger
robb
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
roger
robb
well,
even
assuming
that
to
be
true,
may
it
please
your
honor,
now
this
court
has
held
in
many
cases,
but
although
public
streets
and
public
parks
are
public
property
and
held
in
trust
for
the
public,
the
government
may
not
under
the
guise
of
regulating
the
use
of
the
streets
or
parks
impinge
upon
the
right
of
free
speech.
mr.
roger
robb
well,
--
mr.
roger
robb
well,
i
don't
quite
follow
your
honor's
analogy
in
that
connection.
it
seems
to
me
obviously,
everybody
can
have
a
license
for
radio
station
because
there
are
not
enough
frequencies
left
out.
mr.
roger
robb
well,
that
maybe
taken
care
by
the
general
fairness
doctrine
about
which
i
have
no
comment,
except
to
say
that
there's
a
distinction
i
think
and
a
very
sharp
distinction
between
a
general
requirement
that
during
the
term
of
his
license,
a
radio
broadcasting
company
must
observe
general
fairness.
and
if
it
failed
to
do
so,
at
the
end
of
its
term,
it
might
not
get
his
license
back.
i
think
a
distinction
between
that
situation
and
the
situation
we
have
here
where
the
government
undertake
to
tell
a
radio
broadcaster
what
it
must
broadcast
and
who
it
must
be
put
on
the
air.
mr.
roger
robb
i
beg
pardon?
mr.
roger
robb
well,
your
honor
says
in
principle
your
honor,
it
makes
a
lot
of
difficult
to
answer
because
the
principle
might
be
extended
to
lengths
which
i
would
not
be
able
to
accept.
mr.
roger
robb
yes
sir.
mr.
roger
robb
i
would
answer
that
question,
no,
yes
sir.
mr.
roger
robb
i
think
that's
what
they're
doing
in
this
case
--
mr.
roger
robb
i
don't
think
i
phrased
it
quite
that
well
your
honor.
i
think
i'd
say
--
mr.
roger
robb
your
honor,
say
the
public
has
no
right
to
hear
it.
i
would
say
that
the
government
has
no
right
to
dictate
to
the
broadcaster
that
he
must
present
it
to
the
public
in
a
certain
way
in
certain
time
for
a
certain
person.
mr.
roger
robb
yes
sir.
i
might
point
out
to
the
court
in
that
connection
with
the
respect
to
the
general
proposition
of
fairness
that
the
record
shows
here
that
red
lion
did
broadcast
i
think
half
an
hour
at
one
time
and
15
minutes
in
another
time
did
give
to
the
democratic
national
committee,
that
time,
to
broadcast
a
general
program
on
what
was
called
eight
clubs
of
the
air,
which
included
mr.
hargis
who
is
involved
in
this
broadcast,
so
that
the
public
did
have
that
before
it.
mr.
roger
robb
oh,
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
mr.
roger
robb
well,
i
notice
in
the
brief
of
the
government,
a
reference
to
a
decision
of
the
f.c.c.
in
a
case
in
which
it
was
attempted
to
cancel
the
license
of
a
broadcasting
station
on
the
ground
that
the
station
over
a
period
of
years
had
been
broadcasting
anti-semitic
programs,
and
the
federal
communications
commission
held
that
was
not
a
profit
ground
upon
which
to
revoke
the
license.
so
apparently
and
obviously
i
think,
the
federal
communications
commission
draws
a
distinction
between
such
a
proceeding
and
such
a
--
an
attack
upon
that
station,
and
the
case
which
we
have
before
us
where
in
a
particular
case,
with
the
respect
to
a
particular
matter,
the
station
is
told
that
it
must
broadcast
particular
material
through
the
voice
from
the
mouth
of
a
particular
individual.
irrespective
of
the
fact
that
the
station
may
have
been
overall
perfectly
fair
with
respect
to
the
issue
discussed.
this
isolates
a
particular
individual
and
the
particular
individual
desires
from
the
general
question
of
whether
during
its
term
of
service,
the
station
has
been
fair
and
reasonable.
mr.
roger
robb
i
think
it's
a
question
of
principle
your
honor.
mr.
roger
robb
i
think
the
principle
is
the
distinction
between
dictating
a
particular
program
which
i
think
--
think
come
out
to
censorship.
and
over
a
period
of
years,
a
passing
judgment
on
whether
or
not
the
performance
of
the
station
over
those
years
had
been
fair.
i
can
see
a
distinction
there.
mr.
roger
robb
yes.
i
think
that's
probably
what
mr.
chafee
had
in
mind
when
he
wrote
his
article
on
this
matter,
in
which
he
said
that
dictating
a
particular
program
and
the
contents
of
one
is
the
very
essence
of
censorship.
mr.
roger
robb
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
roger
robb
well
--
mr.
roger
robb
yes
sir.
mr.
roger
robb
mr.
justice
stewart
asked
the
solicitor
general
whether
or
not
red
lion
was
on
notice
that
it
would
be
required
to
give
free
time.
well,
i
can't
state
definitely
that
it
would
not.
i'm
advised
that
there
was
nothing
clearly
stated
prior
to
his
ruling
which
put
red
lion
on
notice
that
it
must
give
this
free
time.
and
obviously,
many
of
the
radio
stations
who
responded
to
mr.
cook
felt
that
their
obligation
was
fully
fulfilled
when
they
offered
him
time
on
a
paid
basis.
i
think
unless
the
court
has
for
further
questions,
that
is
all
time
that
i
will
impose
upon
the
court.
mr.
roger
robb
may
it
please
the
court,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
facts
in
this
case
may
be
briefly
stated.
in
1964,
the
petitioner
red
lion
broadcasts
a
15-minute
program
by
one
billy
james
hargis,
in
which
mr.
hargis
attacked
mr.
fred
j.
cook
in
connection
with
a
book
that
mr.
cook
had
written.
the
hargis
talk
was
part
of
a
series
and
was
carried
on
a
number
of
other
radio
stations
and
red
lion
was
paid
for
the
time.
having
learned
of
the
attack,
mr.
cook
wrote
to
red
lion
invoking
the
so-called
personal
attack
doctrine
of
the
federal
communications
commission
and
demanding
that
he
be
given
time
to
reply.
in
response,
red
lion
offered
to
make
time
available
to
mr.
cook
at
the
station's
regular
rate,
or
to
give
mr.
cook
free
time
if
he
stated
that
he
would
--
that
he
could
not
pay
for
time.
mr.
cook
rejected
the
offer
of
time
on
a
paid
basis
and
refused
to
state
that
he
could
not
pay
for
time.
and
he
complained
to
the
federal
communications
commission
that
red
lion
was
in
violation
of
the
so-called
personal
attack
doctrine.
the
commission
ruled
that
having
presented
a
personal
attack
on
an
individual
and
his
honesty,
character
or
integrity
in
connection
with
a
controversial
matter
of
public
importance,
red
lion
was
bound
by
the
personal
attack
rule
and
doctrine.
to
inform
mr.
cook,
the
individual
involved
of
the
attack,
to
send
him
a
tape
or
a
transcript
or
a
summary
of
the
broadcast,
and
upon
his
demand
to
afford
him
free
time
to
reply.
the
commission
held
that
that
mr.
cook
was
under
no
obligation
to
make
any
showing
of
inability
to
pay.
red
lion
was
directed
it
to
comply
with
this
ruling.
red
lion
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
this
circuit
which
stay
in
the
commission's
ruling
and
this
court
thereafter
granted
certiorari.
i
might
interpolate
that
as
this
court
has
recognized,
this
case
is
a
companion
case
and
closely
involved
with
the
next
case
number
717,
that
the
red
lion
situation
involve
a
specific
application
of
the
rule
involved
in
number
717.
in
the
interest
of
clarity,
might
be
helpful
to
the
outset
to
suggest
certain
matters
which
i
conceive
are
not
in
issue
here.
first,
there
is
no
question
but
that
the
hargis
broadcast
contained
a
personal
attack
on
mr.
cook
within
the
meaning
of
the
definition
of
the
f.c.c.
second,
there
is
no
issue
as
to
the
truth
or
falsity
of
the
hargis
broadcast
or
after
the
good
faith
of
hargis
in
making
it
or
the
good
faith
of
red
lion
in
broadcasting
it.
the
ruling
of
the
commission
and
the
opinion
of
the
court
below
make
it
clear
that
these
matters
where
held
to
be
immaterial.
in
other
words,
red
lion
was
bound
to
comply
with
the
commission's
order
whether
the
broadcast
was
true
or
false,
and
whether
the
broadcaster
carried
it
believing
it
to
true
or
not.
third
and
obviously,
there
is
no
issue
here
as
to
whether
mr.
hargis
and
his
philosophy
about
mr.
cook
and
his
are
worthy
or
unworthy.
the
issue
is
simply
one
of
law
without
regard
to
the
personal
beliefs
or
philosophies
of
the
individuals
involved,
where
otherwise,
i
might
not
be
here.
fourth,
it
is
conceded
i
believe
by
the
government
perhaps
with
some
qualifications
that
radio
and
television
are
part
of
the
press
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
now,
i'm
informed
that
mr.
cox
in
number
17-717
will
discuss
rather
fully
of
the
statutory
questions
involved
here.
i
would
like,
if
i
might,
to
focus
briefly
upon
the
constitutional
question.
simply
stated
the
issue
here
i
suggest
is
whether
or
not
the
order
of
the
federal
communications
commission
to
red
lion
imposes
a
burden
of
previous
restraint
upon
free
speech
in
the
press
which
is
forbidden
by
the
first
amendment.
does
this
order
imposed
on
red
lion
a
burden?
we
submit
that
obviously
it
does.
the
burden
consists
of
the
cost
of
preparing
a
tape
or
a
transcript,
of
sending
it
to
the
individual
attacked
and
providing
free
time,
and
perhaps
and
i
emphasize
this,
perhaps
providing
free
time
by
displacing
some
other
program
which
is
paid
for.
this
as
i
understand
the
government's
brief,
they
concede
that
a
burden
is
imposed,
but
they
assert
somewhat
blandly
i
think
that
the
cost
is
not
substantial
and
the
burden
is
not
undo.
and
likewise
judge
tamm
thought
that
such
a
burden
was
not
unreasonable.
now
in
general,
we
challenge
the
proposition
that
the
exercise
of
first
amendment
rights
maybe
burdened
with
the
financial
penalty
so
long
as
the
government
or
the
federal
communications
commission
thinks
the
amount
of
the
penalty
is
reasonable.
we
ask
what
standard
does
the
government
apply
to
determine
what
is
reasonable
and
what
is
not.
would
the
government
say
that
a
large
chicago
television
station
which
is
required
to
donate
15
minutes
of
time
for
which
a
commercial
sponsor
would
be
charged
$2,000.00?
would
the
government
say
that
that
station
is
not
subjected
to
an
unreasonable
and
honorous
burden.
we
submit
that
the
commandment
of
the
first
amendment
is
simply
"thou
shall
not
abridge"
and
it
is
not
"you
may
abridge
but
please
try
to
keep
it
reasonable."
in
any
event,
the
impact
of
a
financial
penalty
and
the
threat
of
future
penalties
are
serious
matters
for
red
lion
broadcasting
company.
this
station
is
located
in
the
city
of
red
lion,
pennsylvania
which
is
a
small
town,
having
a
population
of
less
than
6,000.
as
the
record
discloses,
it
is
a
daytime
only
station
which
must
compete
for
revenues
with
two
fulltime
and
one
daytime
station
located
in
the
york,
pennsylvania,
and
a
fulltime
station
hanover,
pennsylvania.
york,
the
county
seat
with
the
population
of
some
55,000
is
only
six
miles
away.
hanover
is
18
miles
away.
there
for
a
small
station
facing
such
competition,
any
donation
of
free
time
as
a
practical
matter
is
not
a
trivial
concern,
and
repeated
donations
might
very
well
drive
the
station
out
of
existence.
mr.
roger
robb
does
your
honor
referred
by
the
other
burdens
to
the
--
well
i
think
--
mr.
roger
robb
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
roger
robb
yes,
yes
indeed,
that
of
course
is
a
burden
issue.
mr.
roger
robb
yes
sir.
mr.
roger
robb
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
but
i
think
we
have
to
consider
in
analyzing
the
effect
of
this
order
for
regulation,
consider
the
entire
impact
that
went
on
the
station
and
the
disruption
of
programming
for
station
is
a
very
serious
matter,
specially
--
mr.
roger
robb
yes
sir.
the
record
shows
mr.
justice
marshall
that
this
station
carries
one
hour
a
day
called
free
speech
and
that
on
this
program,
anyone
who
wishes
to
appear
may
appear.
i
don't
know
whether
mr.
cook
would
insist
the
station
to
pay
his
expenses
to
get
there
or
not.
that
might
be
the
possibility.
now,
i
mentioned
the
possibility
of
repeated
request
for
donations.
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
rule
of
the
f.c.c.
in
this
case
would
expose
the
station
to
repeated
demands
for
free
time,
unless
the
station
steered
clear
of
the
dangerous
zone
of
personal
attack.
this
very
broadcast
is
a
good
illustration
of
this
proposition.
the
broadcast
is
printed
at
pages
60
and
61
of
the
appendix
and
appears
therein
at
this
one
broadcast
contained
attacks
not
only
on
mr.
cook
but
on
three
other
people
or
groups.
mr.
hargis
attacked
a
man
named
eugene
gleason,
whom
he
identified
as
mr.
cook's
pal.
he
attacked
the
magazine,
the
nation.
he
attacked
mr.
carry
mcwilliams,
the
editor
of
the
nation.
now,
if
red
lion
were
oblige
to
devote
time
for
a
reply
to
each
of
these
attacks,
would
the
government
then
say
that
the
cost
and
the
disruption
of
the
station's
business
where
insubstantial?
now,
i
suggest
that
this
broadcast
furthermore
is
a
striking
example
of
the
fact
that
the
personal
attack
doctrine
as
applied
by
the
commission
fragments
every
discussion
of
a
controversial
matter
of
public
interest
and
importance,
in
due
has
many
separate
controversies
and
issues
as
there
happened
to
be
individuals
or
groups
who
happen
to
be
attacked
in
the
course
of
the
broadcast.
now,
if
the
speaker
happens
to
speak
critically
for
a
dozen
individuals,
each
of
them
thereby
becomes
instantly
a
controversial
matter
or
issue
of
public
importance,
and
the
broadcaster
maybe
required
to
provide
free
time
for
a
dozen
of
answers
which
would
be
an
onerous
burden
indeed.
we
think
this
threat
is
substantial.
we
think
of
the
words
of
this
court
in
cantwell
against
connecticut
in
which
the
court
said
this,
“it
is
not
merely
the
sporadic
abused
of
power
by
the
censor,
but
the
pervasive
threat
inherent
in
this
very
existence
that
constitutes
the
danger
to
freedom
of
discussion”.
we
asked,
can
it
be
set
that
the
financial
penalties
and
the
other
burdens
which
are
--
and
the
penalties
incidentally
have
the
effect
of
a
fine,
and
the
persuasive
and
the
pervasive
threat
of
similar
penalties
in
the
future
do
not
and
could
not
have
a
chilling
and
deterrent
effect
upon
the
exercise
by
red
lion
of
his
first
amendment
rights.
do
these
penalties
and
burdens
and
this
threat
for
the
future
constitute
an
inhibition
and
a
deterrent
less
substantial
than
the
one
struck
by
--
the
ones
that
was
struck
down
by
this
court
in
talley
against
california
and
speiser
against
randall?
we
submit
that
the
answer
must
be
no.
we
submit
the
common
sense
tells
us
plainly
that
the
application
of
the
commission's
rule
and
the
threat
of
future
applications
are
bound
to
make
red
lion
in
the
future
more
reluctant
to
broadcast
any
material
that
involve
the
criticism
of
any
individual
or
group.
undoubtedly,
we
submit,
red
lion
in
the
future
would
tread
more
cautiously,
steering
wider
of
the
dangerous
zone
of
criticism.
the
result
will
be
self-censorship,
nonetheless
virulent
for
having
been
self
imposed.
now,
the
government
argues
that
the
personal
attack
rule
is
necessary
in
order
that
the
public
may
have
both
sides
of
controversial
issues,
and
specifically
so
the
public
may
hear
both
the
attack
and
the
answer.
the
argument
we
suggest
overlooks
the
fact
that
if
the
personal
attack
rule
is
sustained,
the
public
is
likely
to
hear
neither
the
attack
nor
the
answer,
for
the
reason
that
the
attack
may
never
be
broadcast
at
all.
instead
of
stimulating
wide
open,
robust
and
uninhibited
debate,
the
rule
will
tend
to
choke
it
off
at
the
source.
to
prevent
the
introduction
of
any
alleged
impurity
into
the
stream,
the
government
proposes
to
dry
it
up
at
its
source.
now,
the
government
argues
further
that
a
person
attacked
on
a
number
of
radio
stations
maybe
financially
unable
to
pay
for
time
on
them
all.
therefore,
says
the
government,
it's
right
that
he
should
be
given
free
time.
one
answer
to
this
argument
may
be
found
we
think
in
the
language
of
this
court
in
cantwell
against
connecticut,
where
the
court
said
and
i
quote,
“to
persuade
others
to
his
own
point
of
view,
the
pleader
as
we
know
at
times
resort
to
exaggeration,
to
vilification
of
man
who
have
been
or
are
prominent
in
church
or
state,
and
even
to
false
statement,
but
the
people
of
this
nation
have
ordained
in
the
light
of
history
that
in
spite
of
the
probability
of
excesses
and
abuses,
these
liberties
are
in
the
long
run
essential
to
enlighten
opinion
and
right
conduct
on
the
bottom
citizens
of
a
democracy.”
we
submit
in
this
case
that
the
possibility
of
isolated
abuses
and
individual
cases
of
such
abuses
cannot
justify
the
imposition
of
a
stifling
blanket
of
restraint
on
the
first
amendment
rights
of
all
broadcasting
stations.
now,
the
government's
argument
when
analyzed
rests
on
the
premise
that
those
who
listened
and
who
listened
--
listen
to
the
programs
of
red
lion
have
no
other
source
of
information,
no
access
to
a
wide
diversity
of
opinion.
the
facts
destroyed
the
underpinning
of
the
argument.
according
to
the
broadcasting
yearbook
and
tv
digest
fact
book
for
1969,
the
regions
of
the
city
of
red
lion
have
access
to
radio
programs
broadcast
from
nine
towns
or
cities,
which
are
hanover,
pennsylvania,
harrisburg,
carlyle,
elizabeth
town,
lancaster,
lebanon,
york,
philadelphia
and
baltimore.
they
have
access
to
television
programs
from
five
different
cities,
namely
lancaster,
lebanon,
harrisburg,
york
and
baltimore.
it
is
inconceivable
that
the
listening
audience
of
red
lion
remains
glued
to
that
station's
frequency,
isolated
and
insulated
from
all
other
sources
of
information
and
opinion.
the
possibility
of
a
failure
of
diversity
of
tongues
and
diversity
of
opinion,
we
submit
is
most
remote.
again,
the
government
relies
upon
the
fact
that
this
court
held
in
the
national
broadcasting
company
case
that
radio
broadcasting
is
subject
to
regulation.
we
agree.
it
did
hold
that.
but
it
does
not
follow
from
that
decision
and
that
the
government
may
dictate
the
content
of
radio
programs
or
impose
burdens
on
the
exercise
of
first
amendment
rights.
the
government
may
assign
frequencies
and
channels,
giving
consideration
to
the
character
and
the
financial
standing
and
ability
of
an
applicant.
it
may
evaluate
the
total
performance
of
a
broadcaster
during
the
term
of
his
license.
it
may
supervise
the
methods
of
competition
adopted
by
broadcasters.
but
all
of
such
regulation,
we
submit,
is
a
far
cry
from
the
order
to
red
lion
which
dictates
what
the
content
of
a
particular
program
shall
be
and
who
the
speaker
shall
be.
eventhough
red
lion
may
have
been
fair,
may
have
broadcast
other
points
of
view,
red
lion
is
told
by
the
commission,
you
must
put
on
mr.
cook,
you
must
give
him
time.
an
order
of
this
sort,
we
submit,
is
precisely
the
kind
of
censorship
and
abridgement
that
the
first
amendment
condemns.
now,
as
this
court
has
consistently
held
when
first
amendment
rights
are
tangled
with
conduct,
which
the
government
may
regulate,
the
first
amendment
rights
must
be
preserved
and
they
must
not
be
curtailed
by
regulation
directed
at
the
abuses
which
are
subject
to
government
control.
where
if
not
so,
then
freedom
of
speech
in
the
press
would
always
be
subject
to
abridgement
and
control
by
the
subtle
and
indirect
method
of
associating
them
and
their
exercise
with
other
conduct
which
might
be
controlled.
finally,
the
government
seeks
comfort
from
the
fact
that
the
number
of
radio
frequencies
is
limited.
it
follows
we
are
told
that
broadcasters
hold
these
frequencies
in
trust
with
the
public,
and
they
must
therefore
bow
to
the
interest
of
the
public
as
that
maybe
interpreted
and
defined
by
the
commission.
but
the
public
streets,
the
public
parks,
the
public
buildings
are
likewise
held
in
trust
for
the
public,
yet
this
court
has
not
permitted
that
fact
to
justify
restraints
upon
the
exercise
therein
of
first
amendment
rights.
in
any
event,
we
submit
that
the
first
amendment
rights
of
radio
broadcasters
should
not
be
conditioned
on
the
number
of
radio
stations
in
existence,
whether
there
be
few
or
many
should
not
determine
whether
they
should
enjoy
the
protection
and
the
full
protection
of
the
first
amendment.
finally,
if
the
number
and
diversity
of
tongues
are
factors
to
be
considered,
we
point
to
the
fact
that
there
are
more
than
6,000
commercial
radio
stations
in
this
country
today,
three
and
a
half
times
as
many
radio
stations
as
there
are
daily
newspapers.
and
we've
urged
you
to
say
that
the
circulation
and
the
listening
public
of
those
radio
stations
far
exceeds
the
circulation
and
the
reading
public
of
daily
newspapers.
now,
a
word
aired
to
the
government's
argument
that
the
personal
attack
doctrine
is
authorized
by
statute,
specifically
section
315
and
other
sections
of
the
communications
act.
mr.
cox
as
i
am
reliably
informed
will
discuss
this
matter
in
his
argument,
we
have
mentioned
it
in
our
brief,
we
support
and
adopt
mr.
cox's
argument.
we
make
these
points
very
briefly
stated.
the
first
place,
the
statute
definingly
functions,
powers
and
duties
of
the
federal
communications
commission
certainly
does
not
in
terms
authorize
the
personal
attack
rule.
certainly,
we
say
that
meddling
with
the
control
of
the
programs
or
the
content
of
programs
is
no
part
of
the
federal
communications
commission's
function.
we
suggest
furthermore
that
a
statute
which
purports
or
is
claimed
to
authorize
impingement
upon
first
amendment
rights
must
be
strictly
construed
and
carefully
examined.
it
should
not
be
broadly
construed.
with
respect
to
the
argument
that
the
1959
amendment
to
section
315
(a)
authorized
the
personal
attack
rule,
we
point
out
that
that
amendment
was
adopted
three
years
before
the
personal
attack
rule
was
articulated
by
the
federal
communications
commission.
and
therefore,
it
seemed
somewhat
difficult
to
conclude
that
the
congress
intended
in
terms
to
refer
to
that
rule
and
to
authorize
it.
we
point
out
and
suggest
also
that
the
purpose
of
the
1959
amendment
was
to
cure
a
blackout
which
had
been
caused
by
a
free
time
requirement,
and
therefore,
it
seemed
somewhat
anomalous
to
argue
that
congress
intended
by
this
curative
amendment
to
authorize
a
similar
blackout
caused
by
a
free
time
requirement.
of
course,
we
say
also
that
if
the
statute
does
purport
to
authorize
any
such
action
by
the
commission,
the
statute
is
pro
tanto
unconstitutional.
in
conclusion,
we
submit
that
this
case
plainly
demonstrates
the
wisdom
of
what
this
court
said
in
roth
against
united
states
and
repeated
in
smith
against
california.
the
court
said
and
i
quote,
“the
fundamental
freedoms
of
speech
and
press
have
contributed
greatly
to
the
development
and
well
being
of
our
free
society,
and
though
indispensable
to
its
continued
growth,
ceaseless
vigilance
is
the
watchword
to
prevent
the
erosion
by
congress
or
by
the
states.
the
door
barring
federal
and
state
intrusion
into
this
area
cannot
be
left
to
chart.
it
must
be
kept
tightly
closed
and
opened
only
the
slightest
crack
necessary
to
prevent
encroachment
upon
more
important
interest."
mr.
roger
robb
yes
sir.
mr.
roger
robb
mr.
justice
white,
i
read
those
new
rules
and
to
tell
you
the
truth,
i'm
not
sure
what
the
answer
would
be
because
i
know
those
rules
exclude
regular
news
programs
from
the
coverage
of
personal
attack
doctrine.
but
whether
this
would
be
construed
is
could
be
confused
a
news
program,
i
really
don't
know.
mr.
roger
robb
yes
sir.
mr.
roger
robb
yes
sir.
mr.
roger
robb
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
mr.
roger
robb
well,
that
i
think
involves
the
so-called
editorializing
rule
which
is
involves
in
717.
i
prefer
to
leave
that
question
to
the
experts
your
honor.
i'm
--
but
i
suppose
so,
but
of
course,
they
wouldn't
get
paid
for
that
--
mr.
roger
robb
yes
sir.
mr.
roger
robb
yes
sir.
mr.
roger
robb
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
roger
robb
yes
sir.
and
we
submit
in
conclusion
that
the
personal
attack
doctrine
applied
here
is
an
attempt
to
try
to
open
the
door,
barring
intrusions
on
first
amendment
rights.
mr.
roger
robb
yes
sir.
mr.
roger
robb
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
roger
robb
well,
--
mr.
roger
robb
yes
sir.
mr.
roger
robb
i
don't
think
it
is
your
honor.
i
think
it's
a
very
serious
one.
mr.
roger
robb
i
think
it's
a
very
serious
one.
i
think
this
is
an
attempt
--
mr.
roger
robb
i
think
this
--
mr.
roger
robb
well,
my
feeling
when
i
read
that
was
your
honor
that
this
that
we
have
before
us
here
attempt
to
pry
this
door
wide
open,
and
i
think
we
should
stop
it.
mr.
roger
robb
well,
my
personal
opinion
your
honor
is
that
you
don't
balance
first
amendment
rights,
it's
either
you
have
them
or
you
don't.
and
as
i
say,
i
don't
think
that
the
first
amendment
says
you
can
abridge
just
a
little
bit
of
reason,
i
think
the
first
amendment
says
you
can
abridge,
and
i
think
that
this
an
attempt
to
abridge.
i
think
your
honor
has
written
some
opinions
taken
that
position
if
i'm
not
mistaken.
mr.
roger
robb
yes
sir,
i
hope
so.
i
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
if
i
may
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
roger
robb
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
referring
briefly
to
the
statement
by
the
solicitor
general
concerning
whether
or
not
this
was
a
final
order
for
which
i
thank
him,
i
think
that
perhaps
i
might
pledge
that
out
a
little
bit
by
reference
to
the
records.
now,
as
has
been
indicated,
when
this
case
was
first
presented
in
the
court
of
appeals
to
a
panel
consisting
of
circuit
judges
miller,
fahy
and
tamm,
the
question
was
raised
as
to
whether
or
not
the
order
involved
was
a
final
order.
at
that
time,
the
respondent
commission
was
represented
by
mr.
giller
his
general
counsel
and
by
mr.
assistance
attorney
general
turner
of
the
department
of
justice.
judge
miller
in
his
opinion
said
this
in
which
appeared
at
page
84
of
the
joint
appendix.
in
considering
this
matter,
we
are
confronted
by
the
threshold
question,
whether
the
commission's
letters
of
october
6
and
december
9
were
final
orders
from
which
an
appeal
maybe
taken.
pursuant
to
our
invitation,
the
parties
have
submitted
memoranda
on
the
question
in
which
they
agreed
that
the
commission's
letters
constitute
final
appealable
orders.
however,
judge
miller
and
judge
tamm
held
that
the
orders
were
not
finally
appealable.
judge
fehy
dissented
in
which
he
said,
“all
parties
including
the
one
against
whom
the
ruling
was
made,
understood
the
commission
had
decided
finally
that
red
lion
was
under
obligation
to
comply
with
the
fairness
doctrine
and
had
so
notified
the
red
lion.”
thereafter,
there
was
a
motion
for
a
rehearing
en
banc,
in
which
again,
the
respondent
was
represented
by
mr.
turner
of
department
of
justice,
and
as
judge
tamm
points
out
in
his
opinion,
final
opinion,
thereafter,
the
united
states
and
the
federal
communications
commission
petition
for
en
banc
rehearing
of
the
case.
in
other
words,
at
mr.
--
as
had
been
pointed
out,
all
parties
joined
in
that
petition
and
i
note
in
the
brief
for
the
government
filed
here
at
page
9,
appears
the
statement.
number
2
here
and
after
red
lion
involves
a
challenge
to
a
1965
commission
order
directing
red
lion
broadcasting
company
inc.
licensee
of
radio
station
wgcb
in
red
lion
to
afford
time
to
fred
j.
cook.
so,
i
take
it
there
can
be
no
question,
so
far
as
the
government
is
concerned,
this
is
a
final
appealable
order.
now,
mr.
griswold
has
made
reference
to
the
distinction
what
he
argues
between
newspapers
and
radio
in
the
matter
of
regulation.
and
he
suggest
that
since
radio
is
subject
to
some
regulation,
therefore,
should
be
distinguished
from
the
case
of
newspapers.
we
suggest
that
newspapers
are
also
subject
to
the
law.
they're
subject
to
the
antitrust
laws.
they're
subject
to
the
obscenity
laws
perhaps
to
a
certain
degree.
but
that
does
not
mean
that
the
government
may
dictate
what
maybe
publish
or
what
not
maybe
publish.
the
newspapers
enjoy
the
privilege
of
law
postal
rights
as
do
periodicals,
but
this
court
has
held
in
the
hannegan
v.
esquire
case
that
the
fact
that
these
rates
are
granted
to
publications
as
a
privilege,
does
not
authorize
the
government
to
determine
what
is
in
the
public
interest
to
be
mailed
and
what
is
not.
now,
let
me
advert
briefly
in
connection
with
newspapers
and
news
stories
to
the
question
put
to
me
yesterday
by
mr.
justice
white,
and
which
perhaps
at
the
time,
i
failed
to
understand
fully
or
misunderstood.
the
question
as
i
recall
it
was
whether
or
not
this
hargis
broadcast
might
have
been
carried
as
a
bonafide
newscast,
and
therefore
have
avoided
the
requirement
that
free
time
be
given
for
a
reply.
i
think
in
the
first
place
is
if
one
examines
this
broadcast
that
one
must
reach
a
conclusion
that
under
no
stretch
of
the
imagination
could
this
be
considered
a
bonafide
news
broadcast.
it
is
a
discussion
and
an
attack
on
mr.
cook
and
his
book.
however,
and
this
matter
is
discussed
at
some
length
in
the
brief
filed
in
number
717
by
columbia
broadcasting
system.
however,
in
the
first
place,
under
the
fairness
doctrine
or
the
personal
attack
doctrine
as
it
stand
stood
the
time
of
the
broadcast,
there
was
no
exemption
for
a
personal
attack
carried
in
a
news
broadcast.
mr.
roger
robb
yes
sir,
but
even
under
current
rules,
may
it
please
the
court,
even
under
the
current
rules,
and
the
current
rule
is
published
at
page
20,
printed
at
page
20
of
the
cbs
print.
mr.
roger
robb
it
is
still
subject
to
the
fairness
doctrine
unless,
unless
the
broadcaster
carry
some
general
answer
to
the
attack
in
some
other
way.
mr.
roger
robb
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
mr.
roger
robb
yes
sir.
and
as
the
seventh
circuit
held
in
the
other
case,
our
reading
of
the
latest
amendment
indicates
that
unless
the
response
of
the
person
attacked
is
fairly
prevented
by
the
licensee
on
the
attack
issue
of
the
exempt
broadcast,
the
licensee,
he
must
adhere
to
the
explicit
requirements
of
the
rules,
so
that
the
exception
is
really
rather
--
a
rather
insubstantial.
now,
--
mr.
roger
robb
well,
--
mr.
roger
robb
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
roger
robb
well,
even
assuming
that
to
be
true,
may
it
please
your
honor,
now
this
court
has
held
in
many
cases,
but
although
public
streets
and
public
parks
are
public
property
and
held
in
trust
for
the
public,
the
government
may
not
under
the
guise
of
regulating
the
use
of
the
streets
or
parks
impinge
upon
the
right
of
free
speech.
mr.
roger
robb
well,
--
mr.
roger
robb
well,
i
don't
quite
follow
your
honor's
analogy
in
that
connection.
it
seems
to
me
obviously,
everybody
can
have
a
license
for
radio
station
because
there
are
not
enough
frequencies
left
out.
mr.
roger
robb
well,
that
maybe
taken
care
by
the
general
fairness
doctrine
about
which
i
have
no
comment,
except
to
say
that
there's
a
distinction
i
think
and
a
very
sharp
distinction
between
a
general
requirement
that
during
the
term
of
his
license,
a
radio
broadcasting
company
must
observe
general
fairness.
and
if
it
failed
to
do
so,
at
the
end
of
its
term,
it
might
not
get
his
license
back.
i
think
a
distinction
between
that
situation
and
the
situation
we
have
here
where
the
government
undertake
to
tell
a
radio
broadcaster
what
it
must
broadcast
and
who
it
must
be
put
on
the
air.
mr.
roger
robb
i
beg
pardon?
mr.
roger
robb
well,
your
honor
says
in
principle
your
honor,
it
makes
a
lot
of
difficult
to
answer
because
the
principle
might
be
extended
to
lengths
which
i
would
not
be
able
to
accept.
mr.
roger
robb
yes
sir.
mr.
roger
robb
i
would
answer
that
question,
no,
yes
sir.
mr.
roger
robb
i
think
that's
what
they're
doing
in
this
case
--
mr.
roger
robb
i
don't
think
i
phrased
it
quite
that
well
your
honor.
i
think
i'd
say
--
mr.
roger
robb
your
honor,
say
the
public
has
no
right
to
hear
it.
i
would
say
that
the
government
has
no
right
to
dictate
to
the
broadcaster
that
he
must
present
it
to
the
public
in
a
certain
way
in
certain
time
for
a
certain
person.
mr.
roger
robb
yes
sir.
i
might
point
out
to
the
court
in
that
connection
with
the
respect
to
the
general
proposition
of
fairness
that
the
record
shows
here
that
red
lion
did
broadcast
i
think
half
an
hour
at
one
time
and
15
minutes
in
another
time
did
give
to
the
democratic
national
committee,
that
time,
to
broadcast
a
general
program
on
what
was
called
eight
clubs
of
the
air,
which
included
mr.
hargis
who
is
involved
in
this
broadcast,
so
that
the
public
did
have
that
before
it.
mr.
roger
robb
oh,
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
mr.
roger
robb
well,
i
notice
in
the
brief
of
the
government,
a
reference
to
a
decision
of
the
f.c.c.
in
a
case
in
which
it
was
attempted
to
cancel
the
license
of
a
broadcasting
station
on
the
ground
that
the
station
over
a
period
of
years
had
been
broadcasting
anti-semitic
programs,
and
the
federal
communications
commission
held
that
was
not
a
profit
ground
upon
which
to
revoke
the
license.
so
apparently
and
obviously
i
think,
the
federal
communications
commission
draws
a
distinction
between
such
a
proceeding
and
such
a
--
an
attack
upon
that
station,
and
the
case
which
we
have
before
us
where
in
a
particular
case,
with
the
respect
to
a
particular
matter,
the
station
is
told
that
it
must
broadcast
particular
material
through
the
voice
from
the
mouth
of
a
particular
individual.
irrespective
of
the
fact
that
the
station
may
have
been
overall
perfectly
fair
with
respect
to
the
issue
discussed.
this
isolates
a
particular
individual
and
the
particular
individual
desires
from
the
general
question
of
whether
during
its
term
of
service,
the
station
has
been
fair
and
reasonable.
mr.
roger
robb
i
think
it's
a
question
of
principle
your
honor.
mr.
roger
robb
i
think
the
principle
is
the
distinction
between
dictating
a
particular
program
which
i
think
--
think
come
out
to
censorship.
and
over
a
period
of
years,
a
passing
judgment
on
whether
or
not
the
performance
of
the
station
over
those
years
had
been
fair.
i
can
see
a
distinction
there.
mr.
roger
robb
yes.
i
think
that's
probably
what
mr.
chafee
had
in
mind
when
he
wrote
his
article
on
this
matter,
in
which
he
said
that
dictating
a
particular
program
and
the
contents
of
one
is
the
very
essence
of
censorship.
mr.
roger
robb
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
roger
robb
well
--
mr.
roger
robb
yes
sir.
mr.
roger
robb
mr.
justice
stewart
asked
the
solicitor
general
whether
or
not
red
lion
was
on
notice
that
it
would
be
required
to
give
free
time.
well,
i
can't
state
definitely
that
it
would
not.
i'm
advised
that
there
was
nothing
clearly
stated
prior
to
his
ruling
which
put
red
lion
on
notice
that
it
must
give
this
free
time.
and
obviously,
many
of
the
radio
stations
who
responded
to
mr.
cook
felt
that
their
obligation
was
fully
fulfilled
when
they
offered
him
time
on
a
paid
basis.
i
think
unless
the
court
has
for
further
questions,
that
is
all
time
that
i
will
impose
upon
the
court.
