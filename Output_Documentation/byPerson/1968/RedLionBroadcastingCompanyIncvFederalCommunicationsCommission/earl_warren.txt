warren
mr.
robb,
may
i
ask
you
this.
you
acquiescent
reasonable
in
this
rule,
don't
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
what
in
principle
is
the
difference
between
the
situation
in
the
case
we
have
here,
where
they
say
that
the
radio
station
must
have
--
must
give
free
time
to
someone
to
answer
on
the
one
hand,
and
on
the
other
hand
that
the
conclusion
of
the
term
of
the
license
that
if
commission
says
to
them
now
here.
you
haven't
been
reasonable,
you
haven't
been
fair,
you've
been
out
of
line
in
what
you
say
is
--
is
they're
using
their
first
amendment
rights
and
therefore
we
take
away
you
license.
now,
what
is
the
difference
in
principle
between
those
two?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
a
question
of
principle
or
is
that
a
question
of
degree?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
is
the
principle?
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
order
words,
it's
a
distinction
between
an
individual
program
and
on
the
one
hand
than
overall
policy
on
the
other.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
mean
to
require
an
answer
is
censorship.
he
certainly
doesn't
mean
that,
does
he?
chief
justice
earl
warren
certainly
he
doesn't

does

chief

isn't
there
something
else
if
it's
--
chief

if
it's

very

mr.

you

your
argument.
chief

warren
have
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
mind
telling
us
how
far
you
think
that
commission
can
go
in
determining
whether
there
has
been
fairness
or
not
by
rules?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
it's
alright,
on
your
own
time.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
then
(inaudible)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
general,
i'd
like
to
ask
you
the
same
question
i
asked
mr.
robb
then.
how
do
you
differentiate
the
two
situations
in
principle
not
in
degree
but
in
principle?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
general
before
you
get
to
that
i
was
just
wondering
if
it
couldn't
be
said
that
there
is
a
greater
inhibition
on
free
speech
where
a
station
is
permitted
to
go
along
for
three
years
under
the
blank
of
it
--
for
the
length
of
its
franchise,
say
what
it
wants,
do
what
it
wants
and
then
at
the
end
of
the
three
years,
risk
the
loss
of
the
franchise
because
in
the
opinion
of
the
federal
communications
commission,
it
had
not
been
fair
with
people
throughout
its
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
because
that
would
actually
be
perhaps
a
censorship
because
of
what
they
thought
and
how
they
acted
in
connection
with
their
first
amendment
rights
where
in
the
specific
instance
all
they
would
have
to
do
would
be
to
grab
the
equal
time
and
they'd
be
free
of
that
obligation?
