could
it
be
under
the
current
rule
makes
that
the
station
had
broadcast
this
attack
in
the
course
of
a
regular
news
program,
would
there
have
to
be
a
reply
--
right
to
reply
order?
justice
byron

white
assuming
for
the
moment
that
the
station
could
do
this,
i
suppose
you'd
still
be
here
and
making
the
same
argument
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
because
you
want
--
you
think
it's
--
you
should
be
protected
in
selling
the
right
to
others
to
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
make
this
person
protest.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it's
the
station
itself
who
wants
to
put
out
its
own
views
sponsor,
why
it
has
ample
opportunity
within
the
present
rules
to
make
personal
attacks
or
anything
it
wants
too
without
affording
an
opportunity
for
a
response,
doesn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
suppose
it
bears
on
your
constitutional
argument
though
--
justice
byron
r.
white
at
least
insofar
as
your
argument
rests
on
some
suggestion
that
it's
the
degree
or
seriousness
of
the
invasion
that
is
relevant
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
are
asserting
station
rights,
not
everybody
else's
aren't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
are
asserting
the
station's
personal
rights
--
justice
byron
r.
white
this
is
just
not
the
current
rule.
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
talking
about
the
current.
justice
byron
r.
white
even
he
isn't
subject
to
the
specific
and
personal
attack
rules,
he's
still
subject
to
the
generalities
of
the
fairness
doctrine
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
in
trying
to
search
out
the
position
of
presenting
it
on
the
other
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
your
-
what's
your
client's
basic
view
of
the
air,
the
atmosphere
through
which
these
waves
travels
really
public
property
or
does
it
belong
to
the
people?
what
was
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
some
people
suggest
that
it's
like
a
public
street.
justice
byron
r.
white
some
people
suggest
it's
like
a
public
street
that
everybody
has
some
right
of
going
into
for
communication
purposes.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
true.
but
if
they're
--
but
couldn't
they
insist
if
they're
going
to
give
people,
certain
selected
people
the
exclusive
right
to
use
the
parks
that
they
let
somebody
else
use
them
too
sometimes
under
some
condition?
justice
byron
r.
white
--
use
the
parks
or
the
streets
or
the
airwaves?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
true,
that's
true,
and
the
people
they
given
to,
the
government
suggests,
they
ought
to
able
to
require
let
somebody
else
into
the
facilities
now
and
then
when
there's
good
reason
to
do
so.
justice
byron
r.
white
i'm
not
suggesting
that
anything
specific
about
these
specific
rules,
but
in
principle,
do
you
object
to
the
notion
that
the
government
--
justice
byron
r.
white
in
principle,
do
you
object
to
the
notion
that
the
government
in
granting
licenses
which
are
available
in
limited
numbers,
if
they
suggest
to
the
licensee
that
under
certain
conditions,
they
must
let
some
other
people
besides
themselves
use
the
facilities?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
fairness
doctrine
just
as
still
--
the
general
fairness
doctrine
still
just
leaves
it
in
the
and
i
take
it
in
the
hands
of
the
broadcaster
to
decide
what
material
would
go
over
the
air
waves
to
create
the
balance
which
the
fairness
doctrine
might
require.
is
that
correct?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
i
ask
you
again,
would
you
say
that
the
government
would
be
disentitle
to
--
in
connection
with
the
license
specific
to
require
that
the
licensee
allows
certain
specific
material
to
go
on
the
airwaves
rather
than
just
leaving
it
up
to
him?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
that's
right.
and
you
say
that
public
has
no
right
in
connection
with
granting
a
license
to
say
to
the
licensee
that
here
are
some
materials
that
you
must
broadcast
at
some
point
in
your
operation.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
some
other
members
of
the
public
want
it
broadcasted.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
say
that
you
may
that
the
government
may
not
say
that
if
john
jones,
a
member
of
the
public
demands
from
you
under
certain
conditions
that
he'd
be
allowed
to
speak
on
your
facilities
that
you
must
do
so,
you
would
say
the
government
may
not
say
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
solicitor
general,
would
it
change
your
argument
at
all
if
the
commission
did
think
that
all
of
these
broadcasts
contained
in
that
appendix
were
subject
in
the
rules?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let
us
assume
that
it
was
--
do
you
say,
perfectly
plain.
i
guess
there
is
a
party's
claim
to
the
contrary?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
do
--
the
parties
do
--
the
parties
presented
as
representatives,
the
kind
of
things
that
would
be
covered
i
take
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
you
disagree
that
they
--
that
it
would
but
there
is
certainly
some?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
the
--
there
is
some
discussion
that
a
--
the
deal
with
the
statute
that
the
sevareid
broadcast
would
be
covered
by
the
rule.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
if
--
i
know,
i
know
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
that,
i
know
that
but
if
--
but
otherwise
if
they
weren't
they
would
be
covered,
do
you
agree
with
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
--
the
real
point
of
asking
was
whether
or
not
it
would
change
your
argument
and
if
it
appeared
that
large
numbers
in
a
--
of
a
--
of
the
regular
--
a
large
amount
of
the
regular
content
of
a
television
broadcast
were
covered
by
these
rules.
did
you
think
the
volume,
the
burden,
the
extent
of
the
burden,
the
--
is
really
a
matter
for
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
yes
but
i
supposed
that
people
are
entitled
to
a
review
of
rulemaking
proceedings,
aren't
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
was.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
law
provides
for
it
i
suppose.
i
guess
it
doesn't
require
the
court
to
deal
with
--
speculate
--
justice
byron
r.
white
don't
you
think
it
is
relevant
to
--
how
the
people
subject
to
them
might
understand
this
language
in
this
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
the
--
i
suppose
the
most
fundamental
argument
on
the
other
side
is
that
this
is
really
promote
self-censorship
as
the
very
words
and
breadth
as
the
rule
will
cause
licensees
to
resort
as
to
a
"bland
diet".
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
the
commission
has
expressed
the
judgment
that
you've
just
stated.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
its
--
in
its
experience
or
in
its
judgment,
this
kind
of
a
rule
will
not
prevent
stations
in
the
first
place
from
putting
out
or
from
discussing
controversial
issues.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that
at
least,
that
was
of
commission's
prediction.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
there
was
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
still
leaves
the
question
now
of
what
the
--
even
if
you
examine
among
their
face
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that's
--
and
in
--
and
at
what
--
under
what
circumstances
or
from
what
evidence
you
conclude
what
the
tendency
will
be?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
have
to
overturn
the
fcc
in
that
respect?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it,
you
think
it
is
critical
to
your
case
to
establish
these
effect
on
the
content
of
the
program
in
the
first
place?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
understand
that,
i
understand
that
but
i
think
it's
critical,
if
it
didn't
affect
the
content
of
the
program?
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
because
it
affected
them
but
if
it
didn't
really
change
the
--
have
the
effect
of
change
in
the
content
of
the
problem,
would
you
still
be
making
this
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
exactly
but
would
they
violate
the
first
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
would
they
violate
the
first
amendment?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
your
example,
i
suppose,
is
the
obvious
(inaudible).
justice
byron
r.
white
but
where
are
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
there
are
two
networks.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
the
government
that
gave
access
with
the
most
of
its
operations
to
a
private
party
the
government
say,
i
just
want
to
make
sure
that
you'd
give
everybody
access
to
mails?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
just
because
somebody
was
offering
communications
that
is
in
the
--
that
he
say,
send
in
the
mail,
it's
what
i
want
to
and
that's
the
end
of
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
communications
to
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
think
this
is
even
a
step
along
the
away
of
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
although
you
--
justice
byron
r.
white
although
you
don't
object
to
the
fairness
doctrine,
generally,
it
tells
the
broadcaster
that
you're
going
to
be
talking
about
controversial
issues
and
overall
you
must
--
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
would
it
change
--
justice
byron
r.
white
would
it
change
your
argument
if
the
commission
had
just
said
in
his
rules
that
if
anybody
slanders
anyone?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
tougher,
you
have
a
harder
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
has
that
effect?
justice
byron
r.
white
not
necessary,
i
take
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
you'd
have
a
different
case
but
you'd
still
be
making
the
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
make
--
would
you
think
the
same
argument
would
be
sound?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
aren't
they
left
though
with
the
obligation
of
presenting
the
other
side
anyway
if
they
do
not
have
to
get
in
those
people
themselves?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
is
why
i
understood
professor
cox
to
say?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
there
seems
--
is
certainly
a
difference
of
the
opinion
then
as
to
the
meaning
of
these
rules
between
you
and
professor
cox
because
he
said
that
in
this
respect,
even
if
they
were
exempt,
they
would
have
to
go
around
to
those
people
find
out
what
their
views
were
and
then
have
the
affirmative
obligation
themselves
to
present
that
broadcast?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
mr.
solicitor
--
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
solicitor
general,
then
i
take
it
--
would
you
distinguish
for
constitutional
purposes
or
for
the
purposes
this
argument
or
even
for
the
purposes
of
commission's
authority
on
the
statute
between
a
situation
where
the
commission
requires
in
certain
situations
that
it
give
the
opportunity
for
certain
people
to
come
on
the
air
and
say
what
they
wanted
and
the
situation
where
the
broadcaster
himself
is
required
in
a
specific
situation
to
broadcast
a
certain
kind
of
material?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
would
you
distinguished
between
those
situationsyou're
your
--
purposes
of
your
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
right.
i
understand
you
to
say
that
that
is
wholly
acceptable
constitutionally
under
the
statute.
but
now
what
if
the
rule
were
that
if
you
make
a
personal
attack
or
you
put
out
a
political
editorial
you
must
go
out
and
ascertain
what
the
other
side
of
the
story
is
and
then
you
yourself
present
it,
what
if
that
were
the
rule?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
what
--
that's
what
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
now
again
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
again
i
asked
you
though
what
if
the
licensee
were
required
himself
to
broadcast
information
of
a
certain
kind?
justice
byron
r.
white
like
mr.
cox
say,
you
have
a
tougher
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
your
inference
--
your
real
escape
patch
on
that
i
take
is
that
he
has
an
alternative.
he
has
the
alternative
of
calling
in
the
people
and
themselves
or
giving
them
the
opportunity
to
--
justice
byron
r.
white
in
any
circumstance,
in
every
specific
circumstance,
the
licensee
is
never
required
himself
to
draft
and
broadcast
information
of
a
certain
kind?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
robb?
justice
byron
r.
white
could
it
be
under
the
current
rule
makes
that
the
station
had
broadcast
this
attack
in
the
course
of
a
regular
news
program,
would
there
have
to
be
a
reply
--
right
to
reply
order?
justice
byron

white
assuming
for
the
moment
that
the
station
could
do
this,
i
suppose
you'd
still
be
here
and
making
the
same
argument
--
justice
byron

--
because
you
want

you
think
it's

you
should
be

white
--
make
this
person
protest.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it's
the
station
itself
who
wants
to
put
out
its
own
views
sponsor,
why
it
has
ample
opportunity
within
the
present
rules
to
make
personal
attacks
or
anything
it
wants
too
without
affording
an
opportunity
for
a
response,
doesn't
it?
justice
byron

well,
i
suppose
it
bears
on

constitutional
argument
though
--
justice

at

you
are
asserting
the

personal
rights

is
just
not

talking
about

even

isn't
subject
to

rules,

subject
to

true.

limited
numbers,
if
they
suggest
to
the
licensee
that
under
certain
conditions,
they
must
let
some
other
people
besides
themselves
use
the
facilities?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
fairness
doctrine
just
as
still
--
the
general
fairness
doctrine
still
just
leaves
it
in
the
and
i
take
it
in
the
hands
of
the
broadcaster
to
decide
what
material
would
go
over
the
air
waves
to
create
the
balance
which
the
fairness
doctrine
might
require.
is
that
correct?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
i
ask
you
again,
would
you
say
that
the
government
would
be
disentitle
to
--
in
connection
with
the
license
specific
to
require
that
the
licensee
allows
certain
specific
material
to
go
on
the
airwaves
rather
than
just
leaving
it
up
to
him?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
that's
right.
and
you
say
that
public
has
no
right
in
connection
with
granting
a
license
to
say
to
the
licensee
that
here
are
some
materials
that
you
must
broadcast
at
some
point
in
your
operation.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
some
other
members
of
the
public
want
it
broadcasted.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
say
that
you
may
that
the
government
may
not
say
that
if
john
jones,
a
member
of
the
public
demands
from
you
under
certain
conditions
that
he'd
be
allowed
to
speak
on
your
facilities
that
you
must
do
so,
you
would
say
the
government
may
not
say
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
solicitor
general,
would
it
change
your
argument
at
all
if
the
commission
did
think
that
all
of
these
broadcasts
contained
in
that
appendix
were
subject
in
the
rules?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let
us
assume
that
it
was
--
do
you
say,
perfectly
plain.
i
guess
there
is
a
party's
claim
to
the
contrary?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
do
--
the
parties
do
--
the
parties
presented
as
representatives,
the
kind
of
things
that
would
be
covered
i
take
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
you
disagree
that
they
--
that
it
would
but
there
is
certainly
some?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
the
--
there
is
some
discussion
that
a
--
the
deal
with
the
statute
that
the
sevareid
broadcast
would
be
covered
by
the
rule.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
if
--
i
know,
i
know
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
that,
i
know
that
but
if
--
but
otherwise
if
they
weren't
they
would
be
covered,
do
you
agree
with
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
--
the
real
point
of
asking
was
whether
or
not
it
would
change
your
argument
and
if
it
appeared
that
large
numbers
in
a
--
of
a
--
of
the
regular
--
a
large
amount
of
the
regular
content
of
a
television
broadcast
were
covered
by
these
rules.
did
you
think
the
volume,
the
burden,
the
extent
of
the
burden,
the
--
is
really
a
matter
for
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
yes
but
i
supposed
that
people
are
entitled
to
a
review
of
rulemaking
proceedings,
aren't
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
was.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
law
provides
for
it
i
suppose.
i
guess
it
doesn't
require
the
court
to
deal
with
--
speculate
--
justice
byron
r.
white
don't
you
think
it
is
relevant
to
--
how
the
people
subject
to
them
might
understand
this
language
in
this
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
the
--
i
suppose
the
most
fundamental
argument
on
the
other
side
is
that
this
is
really
promote
self-censorship
as
the
very
words
and
breadth
as
the
rule
will
cause
licensees
to
resort
as
to
a
"bland
diet".
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
the
commission
has
expressed
the
judgment
that
you've
just
stated.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
its
--
in
its
experience
or
in
its
judgment,
this
kind
of
a
rule
will
not
prevent
stations
in
the
first
place
from
putting
out
or
from
discussing
controversial
issues.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that
at
least,
that
was
of
commission's
prediction.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
there
was
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
still
leaves
the
question
now
of
what
the
--
even
if
you
examine
among
their
face
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that's
--
and
in
--
and
at
what
--
under
what
circumstances
or
from
what
evidence
you
conclude
what
the
tendency
will
be?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
have
to
overturn
the
fcc
in
that
respect?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it,
you
think
it
is
critical
to
your
case
to
establish
these
effect
on
the
content
of
the
program
in
the
first
place?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
understand
that,
i
understand
that
but
i
think
it's
critical,
if
it
didn't
affect
the
content
of
the
program?
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
because
it
affected
them
but
if
it
didn't
really
change
the
--
have
the
effect
of
change
in
the
content
of
the
problem,
would
you
still
be
making
this
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
exactly
but
would
they
violate
the
first
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
would
they
violate
the
first
amendment?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
your
example,
i
suppose,
is
the
obvious
(inaudible).
justice
byron
r.
white
but
where
are
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
there
are
two
networks.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
the
government
that
gave
access
with
the
most
of
its
operations
to
a
private
party
the
government
say,
i
just
want
to
make
sure
that
you'd
give
everybody
access
to
mails?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
just
because
somebody
was
offering
communications
that
is
in
the
--
that
he
say,
send
in
the
mail,
it's
what
i
want
to
and
that's
the
end
of
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
communications
to
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
think
this
is
even
a
step
along
the
away
of
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
although
you
--
justice
byron
r.
white
although
you
don't
object
to
the
fairness
doctrine,
generally,
it
tells
the
broadcaster
that
you're
going
to
be
talking
about
controversial
issues
and
overall
you
must
--
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
would
it
change
--
justice
byron
r.
white
would
it
change
your
argument
if
the
commission
had
just
said
in
his
rules
that
if
anybody
slanders
anyone?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
tougher,
you
have
a
harder
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
has
that
effect?
justice
byron
r.
white
not
necessary,
i
take
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
you'd
have
a
different
case
but
you'd
still
be
making
the
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
make
--
would
you
think
the
same
argument
would
be
sound?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
aren't
they
left
though
with
the
obligation
of
presenting
the
other
side
anyway
if
they
do
not
have
to
get
in
those
people
themselves?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
is
why
i
understood
professor
cox
to
say?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
there
seems
--
is
certainly
a
difference
of
the
opinion
then
as
to
the
meaning
of
these
rules
between
you
and
professor
cox
because
he
said
that
in
this
respect,
even
if
they
were
exempt,
they
would
have
to
go
around
to
those
people
find
out
what
their
views
were
and
then
have
the
affirmative
obligation
themselves
to
present
that
broadcast?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
mr.
solicitor
--
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
solicitor
general,
then
i
take
it
--
would
you
distinguish
for
constitutional
purposes
or
for
the
purposes
this
argument
or
even
for
the
purposes
of
commission's
authority
on
the
statute
between
a
situation
where
the
commission
requires
in
certain
situations
that
it
give
the
opportunity
for
certain
people
to
come
on
the
air
and
say
what
they
wanted
and
the
situation
where
the
broadcaster
himself
is
required
in
a
specific
situation
to
broadcast
a
certain
kind
of
material?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
would
you
distinguished
between
those
situationsyou're
your
--
purposes
of
your
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
right.
i
understand
you
to
say
that
that
is
wholly
acceptable
constitutionally
under
the
statute.
but
now
what
if
the
rule
were
that
if
you
make
a
personal
attack
or
you
put
out
a
political
editorial
you
must
go
out
and
ascertain
what
the
other
side
of
the
story
is
and
then
you
yourself
present
it,
what
if
that
were
the
rule?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
what
--
that's
what
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
now
again
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
again
i
asked
you
though
what
if
the
licensee
were
required
himself
to
broadcast
information
of
a
certain
kind?
justice
byron
r.
white
like
mr.
cox
say,
you
have
a
tougher
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
your
inference
--
your
real
escape
patch
on
that
i
take
is
that
he
has
an
alternative.
he
has
the
alternative
of
calling
in
the
people
and
themselves
or
giving
them
the
opportunity
to
--
justice
byron
r.
white
in
any
circumstance,
in
every
specific
circumstance,
the
licensee
is
never
required
himself
to
draft
and
broadcast
information
of
a
certain
kind?
