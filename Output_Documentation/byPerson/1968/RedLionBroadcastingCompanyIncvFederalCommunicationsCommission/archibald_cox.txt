mr.
archibald
cox
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
outset
of
the
--
my
argument,
there
are
three
semantic
differences,
perhaps
i
should
add
a
fourth
now
between
the
point
of
view
expressed
by
the
solicitor
general
and
the
point
of
view
that
we
submit
to
the
court.
the
first
is
that
this
case
involves
the
personal
attack
and
political
editorial
rules
and
does
not
involve
a
general
attack
on
the
fairness
doctrine.
the
rules
are
very
precise.
they
provide
that
if
a
broadcaster
expresses
a
particular
kind
of
idea,
if
he
criticizes
a
public
official
in
a
way
that
may
be
regarded
as
an
attack
upon
his
honesty,
character,
integrity,
or
like
personal
qualities
whatever
that
may
mean
then
certain
obligations
attached
to
it
and
we
submit
to
the
court
and
i
will
try
to
show
in
more
detail
in
my
argument
that
those
obligations
attached
to
the
expression
of
a
particular
idea
or
kind
of
idea,
the
one
that
is
constitutionally
protected,
are
much
more
onerous
than
any
obligations
imposed
by
the
fairness
doctrine.
and
i
may
say
that
this
is
true
of
those
kinds
of
programs
that
are
characterized
as
exempt
under
the
regulation
that
the
commission
has
a
special
brand
of
the
fairness
doctrine
and
one
that
the
solicitor
general
in
the
statement
the
solicitor
general
would
have
read
if
he
had
trouble
to
read
paragraph
5
to
the
court,
that
said,
“unlike
the
fairness
doctrine
in
general,
there
are
special
obligations
where
there
is
something
that
can
be
characterized
as
a
personal
attack
even
in
a
news
program.”
now,
the
second
semantic
difference
goes
to
our
reading
of
history.
in
fact
the
other
two
go
to
our
reading
of
history.
we
agree
that
the
--
there
are
certain
expressions
of
regulation
of
the
content
of
broadcast
to
be
found
in
the
commission's
administration
of
the
communications
act.
but
i
think
when
you
come
to
read
those
carefully,
you
will
find
that
they
are
expressed
--
they
are
based
upon
a
view
of
the
first
amendment's
application
to
broadcast
which
is
simply
out
of
keeping
with
modern
interpretation
of
the
constitutional
doctrine
of
the
first
amendment
and
out
of
keeping
with
the
current
facts.
the
best
example
is
the
mayflower
role
which
prohibited
a
broadcast
journalist
from
taking
an
editorial
position
on
anything,
a
position
which
surely
would
not
be
sustained
by
this
court
today.
indeed,
judge
bazelon
recently
observed
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
that
it
may
very
well
be
that
some
vulnerable
fcc
policies
cannot
withstand
constitutional
scrutiny
in
the
light
of
contemporary
understanding
of
the
first
amendment
and
the
modern
proliferation
of
broadcasting
outfits.
the
third
thing
which
i
would
mention
now
simply
to
draw
the
court's
attention
and
i
shall
develop
it
at
more
length
later
is
that
also
the
congress
and
this
court
have
of
course
sustained
certain
regulation
of
broadcasting
and
although
congress
has
spoken
in
the
broad
terms
public
interest
that
the
solicitor
general
emphasizes.
both
congress
and
this
court
have
been
very
careful
to
distinguish
between
regulation
that
has
to
do
with
avoiding
interference,
securing
competent
licensees
dealing
with
the
structure
of
the
industry
as
in
the
chain
broadcasting
cases
on
the
one
side
and
regulation
that
lays
hold
of
what
is
said
on
the
other
side.
that's
not
always
a
clear
line
but
i
would
emphasize
that
in
the
history,
both
sides
of
the
line
come
through
and
not
just
the
side
mentioned
by
the
solicitor
general.
the
clearest
expression
is
by
congress
itself
for
it
declared
in
section
326,
“nothing
in
this
act
shall
be
understood
or
construed
to
give
the
commission
the
power
censorship.
and
no
regulation
or
condition
shall
be
promulgated
by
the
commission
which
will
interfere
with
the
right
of
free
speech
by
broadcast
communication.”
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
--
i'm
not
sure
whether
that
was
in
the
radio
act
of
1927.
it
certainly
came
in
the
communications
act
of
1934.
this
court
in
the
sanders
brothers
case
noted
the
licensing
power
on
the
one
hand
but
said
that
on
the
other
hand,
the
commission
was
given
no
control
over
progress
and
i
would
mention
now
too
although
i
shall
elaborate
it
and
give
you
the
language
later
that
congress
on
three
occasions,
the
congress
on
two
and
the
president
on
one
occasion,
rejected
in
the
legislative
process
attempts
to
put
broadcasters
subject
to
the
duties
essentially
the
same
kind
of
duties
that
the
commission
now
seeks
to
impose
in
these
regulations.
my
other
semantic
difference
for
the
solicitor
general
is
of
course
one
mentioned
by
justice
white
and
that
is
that
nothing
has
come
to
be
better
settled
than
that
regulations
of
speech
are
to
be
judged
on
their
face
by
their
tendency
and
that
the
court
will
not
require
the
nation
to
wait
until
a
test
case
arises
before
it
examines
and
if
they
are
unconstitutional
strikes
down
such
regulation.
and
that
proposition
is
so
well
settled
that
i
don't
stop
to
develop.
mr.
archibald
cox
we
must
of
course
go
ahead
and
do
so
and
show
what
the
tendency
will
be
and
i
--
i
propose
to
build
it.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
think
we
can
show
the
court
that
the
tendency
will
be
--
is
bound
to
be
highly
restrictive
especially
in
terms
of
self-censorship
but
i
realize
that's
a
burden
that
i
at
least
in
the
formal
sense
that
i
have
to
go
forward
and
carry.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
would
think
this
was
a
question
on
which
the
court
would
make
up
its
own
mind
on
that
there
was
not
presumption
in
favor
of
the
fcc
ruling.
we
have
to
persuade
the
court
to
reach
a
different
conclusion
but
i
think
there's
no
presumption
in
its
favor.
now,
we
submit
that
these
regulations
are
invalid
upon
two
primary
grounds.
first,
we
say
that
they
unconstitutionally
abridged
the
freedom
of
speech
and
press
guaranteed
by
the
first
amendment
and
second
that
they
are
invalid
because
they
are
beyond
the
statutory
authority
of
the
communications
commission.
i
shall
deal
with
the
constitutional
issue
first
even
though
the
court
may
never
reach
it
or
because
it
can
and
i'm
inclined
to
think
should
decide
the
case
on
the
statutory
ground.
but
i
deal
with
it
first
because
the
seriousness
of
the
constitutional
question
is
in
our
judgment
an
important
element
in
resolving
the
issue
of
statutory
interpretation.
our
constitutional
argument
proceeds
in
a
series
of
propositions.
the
early
ones
of
which
seem
to
me
to
be
not
seriously
controversial
but
first
we
say
this
case
involves
freedom
of
the
press.
the
electronic
media
are
not
simply
carriers
as
they
have
evolved
in
this
country
and
that
may
be
one
difference
between
what
president
hoover
was
thinking
of
in
1924
and
the
situation
as
it
exists
today.
broadcasters'
activities
in
the
field
of
public
affairs
are
virtually
indistinguishable
from
those
of
newspapers.
they
have
editors,
producers,
reporters,
their
own
news
services
which
add
to
the
new
services
of
upi
and
the
ap.
their
functions
i
submit
make
them
one
of
the
very
instruments
which
this
court
characterized
in
mills
and
alabama
as
agencies
which
the
framers
of
our
constitution
thoughtfully
and
deliberately
selected
to
improve
our
society
and
keep
it
free.
second,
i
would
point
out
that
the
challenge
regulations
lay
hold
of
speech
itself.
this
is
the
fact
which
distinguishes
every
other
case
involving
broadcasting
that
has
come
before
this
court
because
they
all
had
to
do
with
the
economic
regulation
of
the
industry.
we're
not
talking
about
fair
labor
standards
and
labor
relations
or
the
antitrust
laws
here.
we're
talking
about
a
regulation
which
says
as
i
indicated
earlier
that
if
you
expressed
ideas
for
certain
character,
ideas
which
can
be
described
as
an
attack
on
somebody's
integrity
or
honesty
or
other
personal
qualities.
or
if
you
put
someone
on
the
air
who
may
engage
in
those
attacks,
then
you
run
the
risk
of
having
to
carry
certain
obligations
which
are
onerous.
but
if
you
stir
clear
of
those
ideas,
if
you
prefer
blandness
to
biting
criticism
of
the
shabby
yourself
seeking
then
you're
safe,
then
you
don't
have
to
worry
and
we
think
that
this
is
fairly
characterized
as
a
regulation
of
speech
itself.
not
only
that,
but
of
course
the
speech
that
this
regulation
lays
hold
of
is
the
kind
of
speech
which
this
court
characterized
in
the
new
york
times
case
as
lying
at
the
very
center
of
the
constitutionally
protected
area
of
free
expression.
by
its
own
terms
these
regulation
applies
only
when
one
is
discussing
questions
of
public
importance.
the
speech
in
the
red
lion
case
was
certainly
within
the
new
york
times
case
and
this
is
true
under
all
the
other
commission
rulings
under
the
fairness
doctrine
or
the
personal
attack
rule
which
deal
with
criticisms
of
public
officials
for
the
most
part
or
people
engaged
in
controversy
upon
public
issues.
my
third
proposition
is
that
the
challenge
regulations
abridge
the
freedom
of
speech
in
ways
which
unless
justify
violate
the
first
amendment.
inhibition
as
well
as
prohibition
of
protected
expression
is
forbidden
by
the
first
amendment.
that's
perfectly
clear
from
cases
like
talley
and
california,
thomas
and
collins,
lamont
and
postmaster
general.
here,
the
commission
as
i
said
before
says
you
may
not
criticize
in
the
way
that
we
would
call
a
personal
attack
unless
you're
prepared
to
scrutinize
what
has
gone
out
over
the
air
and
see
whether
it
contains
any
personal
attacks.
to
give
notice
in
the
transcript,
to
offer
free
time
for
reply
and
then
engage
in
the
negotiations
necessary
to
arrange
the
reply
disrupting
your
other
program,
clearing
time
on
a
nationwide
hookup
if
that
is
necessary.
now,
we
submit
that
attaching
these
burdens
inhibits
the
broadcast
criticism
and
political
editorial
in
four
ways.
i'm
going
to
state
them
and
then
i'm
going
to
turn
to
some
concrete
example
in
an
effort
to
show
exactly
how
they
would
work.
first,
attaching
this
condition
deprives
the
broadcaster
of
his
freedom
of
journalistic
judgment.
even
the
most
fair-minded
manager
of
a
radio
or
television
station
will
think
twice
about
offering
criticism
of
this
kind
if
the
price
he
must
pay
is
surrendering
his
judgment
as
to
what
is
in
the
public
interest.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
we
think
that
it
is
an
essential
part
of
these
regulations
if
i
understand
your
honor
that
they
allowed
hold
of
the
content
of
the
program.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
would
say
if
--
mr.
archibald
cox
there
would
still
be
burdens
that
we
were
made
to
carry.
mr.
archibald
cox
because
of
saying
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
it
would
but
i
don't
think
i
need
to
stand
on
that
because
i
think
the
problem
of
self
censorship
is
very
rarely.
i
suppose
that
had
it
been
effect
in
the
new
york
times
case
that
the
new
york
times
would
have
paid
that
judgment
rather
than
suppress
the
advertisement
that
was
bought
that
there
would
still
have
been
held
to
be
a
violation
of
free
speech
but
we
do
stress
and
we
think
that
it
is
fairly
clear
that
this
will
have
an
effect
on
the
content.
but
i
would
assert
that
i
can
stand
on
both
grounds.
again,
remember
that
the
time
taken
to
complying
with
this
government
order
is
necessarily
taken
from
the
time
that
broadcaster
might
think
and
might
reasonably
think
and
even
rightly
think
it
was
more
in
the
public
interest
in
which
it
was
more
in
the
public
interest
to
broadcast
something
else.
next,
i
would
emphasize
that
there
are
very
considerable
administrative
burdens
and
trouble
to
which
these
regulations
put
the
broadcasting.
he
must
scrutinize
his
scripts
and
see
whether
they
contain
personal
attacks.
consult
with
lawyers
and
probably
more
lawyers
in
order
to
find
out
what
duties
arise
out
of
a
particular
program.
this
--
the
sending
out
of
the
notice
and
the
tape
which
isn't
a
big
thing
for
enlarged
outfit
but
this
regulation
applies
to
little
stations
too.
it's
a
matter
of
clearing
time
for
reply
which
may
vary
from
no
problem
at
all
to
a
really
very
troublesome
and
serious
problem
including
an
effect
on
the
goodwill
of
the
audience.
and
then
there's
the
matter
of
negotiating
the
reply
and
finally
the
matter
of
often
defending
oneself
before
a
commission
and
its
staff
which
has
a
life
and
death
power
over
the
broadcasters
through
its
control
of
licensee.
the
financial
cost
of
giving
the
risk
that
you
must
give
time
whenever
you
put
a
free
swinging
controversialist
on
the
air
is
not
inconsiderable
and
most
of
all
there
is
the
pressure
for
self-censorship
which
these
things
create.
now,
i
would
like
to
take
a
few
concrete
illustrations
to
show
how
as
we
see
it
these
regulations
are
bound
to
work.
let
me
call
your
attention
first
to
a
broadcast
of
eric
sevareid
which
appears
beginning
on
page
15
and
runs
over
to
page
16
of
the
record
in
the
second
volume,
the
one
that
the
solicitor
general
objects
to.
but
we
offer
this
simply
as
examples
of
how
these
regulations
would
work
out.
i
could
make
up
examples
but
it's
more
persuasive
to
use
real
ones
and
that's
the
reason
they
bring
them
into
court.
mr.
sevareid
gave
what
i
think
you
would
agree
was
an
impartial
and
fair
presentation
of
henry
luce's
contributions
to
american
journalism.
toward
the
end
he
said,
it's
on
the
bottom
of
page
16,
he
referred
to
time
and
said
the
time
strained
in
every
sentence
to
avoid
dullness
which
often
meant
straining
proof.
many
journalists
have
always
distrusted
it.
nearly
all
have
always
read
it.
now,
i
suppose
that
that
is
an
attack
on
an
unidentified
group,
the
time
editors
and
it
raises
a
question
about
their
intellectual
integrity
and
if
it
were
directed
at
me,
i
would
think
that
was
an
attack
upon
my
personal
character.
at
the
time
eric
sevareid
said
this,
he
was
not
subject
to
any
inhibitions.
but
considering
today
if
he
were
confronted
with
the
same
situation
preparing
his
evening
broadcast
at
4
o'clock
in
the
afternoon,
what
does
he
do?
is
this
a
personal
attack
or
isn't
it?
well,
he
might
answer
that
it
is
and
then
he
subjects
every
station
that
carries
this
program
to
all
these
burdens.
should
he
do
that
or
should
he
trim
his
sales
a
bit?
or
maybe
he
doesn't
know.
so
what,
does
he
call
up
his
lawyer?
the
result,
all
too
often
is
likely
today
that
mr.
sevareid
will
decide,
“well
i
better
not
say
just
what
i
think.
i
better
find
something
that's
little
safer,
a
little
more
bland
or
remain.”
of
course
this
is
of
great
concern.
he
may
decide
to
transfer
to
a
medium
where
he
would
not
be
subject
to
this
kind
of
inhibition.
mr.
archibald
cox
not
at
all,
page
6
(a)
of
the
appendix
to
the
rtnd
brief.
mr.
archibald
cox
rtnd,
the
--
yes,
my
brief.
that
is
in
the
appendix.
mr.
archibald
cox
page
6
(a),
it's
in
the
very
back
the
next
to
the
last
page
of
the
brief.
mr.
archibald
cox
it
certainly
a
very
important
part.
when
during
a
presentation
of
views
on
the
controversial
issue
of
public
importance,
an
attack
is
made
upon
the
honesty,
character
or
integrity
or
like
personal
qualities
of
any
--
of
an
identified
person
or
a
group.
now,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
editors
of
time
magazine
are
an
identified
group
and
them
saying
that
they
strain
truth
and
that
many
reporters
have
always
distrusted
them,
attacks
because
attack
means
only
adversely
criticized
their
integrity
or
like
personal
qualities,
whatever
that
may
mean.
i
don't
see
how
--
i
would
have
thought
this
was
clearly
a
personal
attack
but
it's
enough
for
my
purposes
to
suggest
that
it
raises
terribly
serious
questions
and
that
because
he
couldn't
be
sure,
eric
sevareid
would
then
be
put
under
pressure
to
tref.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
would
think
that
--
i
would
think
that
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
would
think
a
discussion
--
i
would
think
a
discussion
of
one
of
our
great
national
magazines
and
its
reliability
was
an
issue
of
public
importance.
i
would
be
amazed
if
the
commission
drew
this
distinction.
but
let
me
--
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
--
all
of
this
instance
mr.
justice
--
mr.
archibald
cox
there
are
many.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
that
is
the
core
of
what
i
have
to
say
with
respect
to
this
sevareid
broadcast.
mr.
archibald
cox
we
say
that
this
regulation
is
beyond
the
power
of
congress
and
further
that
congress
hasn't
authorized
the
commission
to
issue
it,
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
both
point,s
i
would
emphasize.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
wouldn't
want
to
say
that
no
one
could
think
of
any
other
kind
of
remedy
and
of
course
if
the
attack
were
not
the
kind
of
criticism
that
is
privileged
under
the
new
york
times
case.
if
it
were
willfully
false
then
we
would
have
an
entirely
different
situation.
but
this
applies
when
it
is
true
and
a
fortiori
when
it
is
just
a
result
of
a
mistake
when
every
word
is
true.
let
me
give
you
another
illustration
of
--
mr.
archibald
cox
how
what?
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
he
has
access
if
he
is
a
public
figure
and
this
is
an
issue.
he
has
access
to
a
number
of
media
that
frequently,
he
will
have
had
an
opportunity
to
present
his
views
on
these
questions
in
all
kinds
of
ways
and
on
many
occasions.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
yes.
but
i
would
emphasize
if
merely
all
these
--
i
would
emphasize
mr.
justice,
i
don't
mean
to
rush
over
what
you
say,
i
gripped
it
completely
but
i
would
emphasize
it
in
nearly
all
of
these
cases.
the
other
person
has
ample
opportunity
to
present
his
views
and
may
have
presented
it
but
the
commission
automatically
comes
along
and
applies
this
requirement.
now,
let
me
take
a
somewhat
different
aspect
of
the
matter.
in
the
second
half
of
this
document,
quite
toward
the
end,
at
a
page
that
is
numbered
55,
is
this
transcript
of
an
appearance
of
adam
clayton
powell
on
“face
the
nation”,
a
panel
show
like
meet
the
press.
it
begins
at
55
and
i
see
now
a
very
troublesome
passage
although
there
are
some
that
might
be
thought
troublesome
until
page
59
when
mr.
powell
says,
“that
anyone
that
has
an
estranged
wife
is
automatically
inherited
a
life.”
i
would
suppose
that
that
was
a
personal
attack
upon
his
wife
and
mr.
powell
was
certainly
discussing
question
of
public
importance
at
the
time
of
this
peruse
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
mean
it's
hard
to
identify
because
they're
--
no,
the
defect
is
--
the
thinner
one,
tpward
the
end
and
i
am
on
page
59,
way
much
farther
long
in
the
second
volume.
the
second
59,
there
are
two
59s.
mr.
archibald
cox
it
was
printed
unfortunately,
i
am
very
sorry
for
that.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
am
pointing
out
that
the
first
personal
attack
is
on
mr.
powell's
wife.
now,
over
on
page
53
--
63,
one
of
the
reporters
questioning
mr.
powell
says,
“does
that
answer
the
question?”
it's
italicized,
“whether
you
advocate
what
rap
brown
and
stokely
carmichael
have
been
advocating,
guerilla-type
warfare
in
the
cities
of
our
country?”
that
would
seem
to
be
a
personal
attack
by
mr.
dean
on
stokely
carmichael
and
rap
brown.
now,
of
course
both
rap
brown
and
stokely
carmichael
have
ample
access
to
the
press.
both
indeed
have
been
on
cbs
shows.
i
don't
think
there
is
any
question
of
fairness
in
getting
their
views
before
the
public
but
nevertheless
under
these
regulations,
there
would
be
a
very
real
question
of
whether
cbs
did
not
have
to
go
through
all
this
machinery
of
giving
them
time
for
reply.
over
on
page
66,
toward
the
bottom,
you
will
see
a
reference
to
representative
conyers
of
detroit
who
was
referred
to
as
a
black
judas.
i
would
think
that
that
was
calling
a
man
a
communist
is
a
personal
attack
as
the
commission
has
said
in
its
opinion
on
this
matter
calling
one
a
black
judas
would
seem
to
me
to
be
a
personal
attack.
over
on
page
67,
mr.
powell
says
that
claude
pepper
was
one
of
the
number
racists
on
money
sellers
committee
against
them.
this
again,
i
should
suppose
though
i
can't
say
without
any
assurance
because
the
government
persists
in
ignoring
these
questions,
i
should
suppose
was
a
personal
attack.
if
it's
a
personal
attack
as
the
commission
has
ruled
to
say
that
the
john
burke's
society
attempted
through
a
front
organization
to
have
a
standard
reference
book
removed
from
the
library
in
visalia,
california.
but
then
i
would
suppose
this
kind
of
thing
was
rather
clearly
a
personal
attack.
and
then
there's
a
reference
to
judge
matthew
levy
for
issuing
an
indecent,
obscene,
illegal,
unilateral
article.
i
would
think
that
that
too
might
well
be
a
personal
attack.
now
the
point
i'm
trying
to
make
is
that
after
this
program
which
was
a
free
live
discussion,
the
work
would
begin,
i'm
going
through
it
and
going
over
these
things,
such
questions
as
justice
stewart
raised
as
to
whether
it
really
was
a
personal
attack.
in
many
instances
might
have
be
taken
into
account,
it
might
be
decided
that
it
wasn't
mr.
justice,
i
agree.
but
the
thing
is
that
nobody
knows
for
sure
and
some
of
my
colleagues
think
that
there
are
many
more
personal
attacks.
but
there
would
be
at
least
six
or
eight
of
them
in
that
single
“face
the
nation”
program
and
all
those
instances
in
which
the
obligations
would
fall
upon
the
network
and
all
cbs
stations
to
carry
out
the
duty
of
offsetting
its
programming
substituting
offers
of
free
time
for
reply
and
the
replies
in
the
place
of
what
matters
which
in
its
editorial
judgment
it
thought
were
more
important.
mr.
archibald
cox
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
using
concrete
illustrations
before
the
luncheon
recess,
the
point
that
i
was
trying
to
make
was
that
these
regulations
have
--
i
think
an
obvious
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
an
obvious
tendency
to
induce
a
broadcaster
and
remember
we're
dealing
with
local
programs
as
well
as
the
nationwide
programs
that
i
used
as
illustrations.
to
press
a
broadcaster
to
prefer
the
bland
pundit,
to
debating
critic,
to
the
shabby
or
self-seeking
to
avoid
putting
on
programs
like
“face
the
nation”
or
their
local
equivalent
roundup
of
reporters
on
a
radio
show,
free
swinging
controversialist
and
diocese
moderators
or
people
who
would
just
stare
the
discussion
away
from
the
criticism
of
government
officials
and
other
public
figures
rather
than
target
it.
and
we
think
that
a
regulation
of
which
has
that
kind
of
impact
on
the
actual
conduct
of
broadcast
journalist
both
because
of
the
burdens
and
even
more
because
of
the
pressure
toward
itself
censorship,
is
a
violation
of
the
first
amendment
unless
it
is
justified
by
some
overriding
public
entries.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
we
would
draw
a
sharp
distinction
and
i
intend
to
elaborate
this
a
little
later
between
the
fairness
doctrine
itself
and
the
personal
attack
and
political
editorial
regulations.
i
am
going
to
explain
in
just
a
moment,
it
comes
a
little
bit
a
step
further
out
(voice
overlap)
the
differences
in
our
position
on
this.
mr.
archibald
cox
because
to
be
quite
candid
mr.
chief
justice,
i
am
speaking
for
a
number
of
parties
here.
they
take
somewhat
different
positions
and
they
have
asked
me
to
state
their
respective
positions
on
that
question
as
carefully
as
i
can
and
i
can
do
it
barely
just
one
step
farther
along
the
way.
mr.
archibald
cox
as
i
was
saying,
we
come
to
the
question
of
justification.
the
justification
advanced
by
the
government
in
its
brief
is
that
restrictions
upon
the
normal
liberty
of
the
press
or
normal
freedom
of
expression
here
are
necessary
in
broadcasting
because
in
order
to
assure
the
public,
access
to
what
the
government
defines
as
a
fair
or
balanced
presentation.
in
oral
argument,
the
solicitor
general
added
as
further
justification
that
the
government
owns
the
airwaves
and
that
what
it
gives
is
a
privilege.
the
addition
of
a
--
of
those
labels
or
concepts,
it
seems
to
me,
don't
really
advance
the
argument
where
the
government
gives
a
privilege
such
as
the
second
class
mail
privilege.
it
still
has
a
duty
to
administer
in
ways
that
don't
inhibit
expression
or
inhibit
the
press.
one
could
use
the
second
class
mail
privilege
as
a
way
of
discouraging
magazines
from
criticizing
public
officials
or
other
public
figure
as
justice
brennan
said
in
the
lamont
case.
if
the
government
wishes
to
withdraw
subsidy
or
privilege,
it
must
do
so
by
means
and
on
terms
which
do
not
endanger
first
amendment
rights
and
i
come
back
here
to
the
point
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
think
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
will
make
two
points
mr.
justice.
first
and
that
was
one
i
tried
to
emphasize
early
in
my
argument
that
broadcasters
are
not
merely
carriers.
broadcasters
as
the
industry
has
grown
up
and
as
they
are
treated
by
the
communications
act
are
themselves
journalists
and
they
have
views
to
express.
and
i
would
think
it
very
questionable
whether
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
there
would
raise
a
very
different
question
than
this
case.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
think
that
the
--
i
think
first
they
haven't
been
treated
as
carriers
and
if
i
would
emphasize
that
we
deal
with
the
case
in
this
context.
second,
i
come
back
to
another
point
that
i
attached
great
importance
to.
and
that
is
that
this
isn't
blank,
say,
taking
two
hours
of
time
which
must
be
given
in
the
morning
to
a
certain
kind
of
programs
that
would
be
established
in
some
way.
this
says
that
the
amount
of
time
we
take
from
you
depends
on
what
you
say
in
conducting
your
own
journalistic
function.
it's
not
like
saying
we'll
take
the
use
of
your
lower
field
so
many
days
a
week
for
a
public
purpose.
it
says
we
will
take
a
day
for
every
time
you
criticize
the
government
or
any
other
public
figure.
this
is
attached
to
the
expression
of
particular
idea.
and
i
think
that
distinguishes
completely
the
cases
of
whether
the
government
could
take
two
hours
a
day
and
say
that
this
shall
be
available
for
certain
kinds
of
public
interest
programs
of
which
will
be
proscribed
--
well,
in
some
nondiscriminatory
and
constitutional
way.
i
don't
--
i
really
don't
think
that
case
may
bother
us
here
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
because
of
the
link
between
the
two.
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
no.
i
have
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
am
afraid
i've
misled
your
honor
if
i
have
given
the
impression
that
that's
my
position.
now,
let
me
come
--
because
i
think
the
argument
about
public
ownership
really
falls
out
and
we're
back
to
the
constitutional
problem.
and
there's
a
question
whether
this
justification
we're
trying
to
provide
the
public
with
a
fair
and
balanced
opinion
is
sufficient.
now,
there
are
two
answers
to
the
argument
with
the
desire
to
provide
fairness
and
balance
in
the
case
of
the
press
is
a
justification
for
these
regulations.
one,
attacks
the
adequacy
of
the
alleged
justification.
this
is
an
argument
which
is
advanced
in
its
strongest
form
by
the
national
broadcasting
company.
the
national
broadcasting
company
says
the
imposition
by
an
arm
of
government
of
its
standard
of
fairness
on
the
press
and
the
enforcement
of
that
obligation
by
governmentally
imposed
sanctions
is
contrary
to
the
constitutional
guarantee
of
freedom
of
the
press.
this
is
an
argument
of
which
might
be
put
a
little
less
absolutely
and
indeed
in
my
brief
i
have
put
much
the
same
argument
a
little
less
absolutely.
as
we
assert
that
the
basic
postulate
of
the
first
amendment
is
that
the
public
interest
in
excess
to
a
variety
of
ideas
is
to
be
secured
by
relying
on
the
diversity
and
multiplicity
of
expression.
developing
in
the
absence
of
the
restraint
--
of
a
restraint
and
that
the
government
is
unable
to
show
anything
here,
it
would
justify
departing
from
that
basic
posture.
now,
i
come
to
your
question
mr.
chief
justice
in
a
sense
to
where
i
said
i
was
afraid
i
have
misled
mr.
justice
white.
the
logic
of
that
argument
thus
put
in
question
the
fairness
doctrine.
i
don't
want
to
mislead
you
and
indeed
the
logic
of
my
argument
that
if
you
do
this
then
you
must
do
that
puts
in
question
to
some
extent
of
the
fairness
doctrine
because
that
essentially
is
a
part
of
the
doctrine.
now,
i
am
going
to
have
--
because
of
the
passage
of
time,
i'm
going
to
have
to
leave
the
development
of
this
--
that
constitutional
argument
to
our
briefs.
the
essence
of
it
is
the
government
notions
of
fairness
of
impartiality
are
a
violation
of
the
first
amendment
that
if
in
some
circumstances
that
may
be
conjured
up.
there
is
sufficient
factual
justification
for
government
intervention.
there
is
no
such
condition
in
the
broadcasting
industry
today
partly
because
of
the
proliferation
of
stations
which
are
10
times
what
they
were
on
the
early
1940s.
partly
because
broadcasting
is
only
one
of
many
media
and
indeed
it
adds
to
the
access
people
otherwise
would
have
two
opinion
and
if
i'm
not
going
through
it
but
if
--
when
you
think
about
the
red
lion
case,
you
noticed
how
the
dialogue
developed
across
media.
it's
a
very
good
indication
that
this
notion
of
the
insulated
listener
that
the
commission
hypothesized
is
not
realistic.
now,
the
argument
that
i
just
mentioned
which
i
say
i
do
refer
your
honors
to
our
briefs
is
not
made
by
cbs.
cbs'
position
which
all
of
us
joined
except
that
we
make
the
other
argument
too,
emphasizes
the
peculiarly
restrictive
character
of
the
challenged
regulation
and
it
asserts
that
even
if
we
suppose
that
there
is
a
justification
for
government
regulation
of
the
fairness
of
broadcasters
in
order
to
ensure
the
public
access
to
a
diversity
of
opinion,
still
these
regulations
with
their
peculiarly
restrictive
character
cannot
be
sustained
because
they
imposed
much
heavier
and
more
burdens
and
restrictions
than
are
necessary
mr.
chief
justice
to
secure
fairness
and
therefore
they
fall
under
the
least
restrictive
alternative
doctrine.
i
hope
that
that
answers
your
questions
as
you
put
it
earlier.
mr.
archibald
cox
about
the
cbs
argument
would
concede
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
the
fairness
doctrine.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
cbs
argument
would
concede
the
--
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
as
i
understand
it,
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
whether
there
--
it
can
be
some
midterm
scrutiny,
i'm
not
sure
that
they've
addressed
themselves
to
that
because
it
isn't
involved.
of
course
the
more
precise
scrutiny
you
put,
the
more
it
becomes
an
inhibition
on
saying
particular
things
and
that
is
an
important
part
of
our
argument.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
think
--
i
wouldn't
--
just
mr.
justice
homes
once
said,
“all
constitutional
differences
that
end
--
come
down
to
differences
in
degree.”
i
think
the
difference
in
degree
--
difference
is
in
principle
and
i
would
submit
that
they
are
matters
of
principle
are
these
mr.
chief
justice
between
the
fairness
doctrine
and
the
personal
attack
rule
and
let
me
try
and
develop
them
and
see
if
they
don't
really
answer
your
question.
and
then
i'm
going
to
again
with
concrete
illustrations
attempt
to
show
at
least
once
how
they
work
out.
the
principle
difference
is,
and
i
think
there
are
differences
in
principle
are
these.
the
fairness
doctrine
looks
at
overall
performance.
the
personal
attack
rule
calls
virtually
for
a
line
by
line,
item
by
item
script.
second,
the
fairness
doctrine
left
discretion
to
the
broadcaster
in
deciding
what
views
deserve
presentation
and
it
holds
him
only
to
a
reasonable
judgment.
the
personal
attack
rules
apply
an
automatic
rule
and
they
leave
the
broadcaster
no
room
for
judgment
in
discerning
what
is
a
personal
attack
and
when
he
must
give
reply
also
where
they
do
give
him
the
benefit
of
acting
in
good
faith
with
respect
to
imposing
any
fine
for
having
failed
to
give
notice.
the
personal
--
the
fairness
doctrine
leaves
discretion
as
to
whether
a
reply
is
needed
to
achieve
fairness.
if
so
who
may
most
appropriately
make
the
reply.
but
the
personal
attack
rule
is
absolutely
automatic.
you
must
give
time,
adequate
time.
you
must
give
it
to
a
particular
individual
and
where
the
generality
of
the
fairness
doctrine
made
it
still
less
restrict
makes
it
less
restrictive
when
it's
coupled
with
the
ideas
of
reasonableness
and
good
faith.
the
vagueness
of
the
terms
character,
honesty
or
other
personal
qualities,
personal
attack
identified
goal.
when
you
apply
them
item
by
item,
increase
the
--
in
pressures
towards
self-censorship
because
if
you're
wrong
these
consequences
all
fall
in
and
the
pressure
is
to
stir
clear
of
the
dividing
line.
now,
i
think
perhaps
a
very
good
illustration
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
archibald
cox
if
the
station
--
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
true
but
the
granting
--
the
equal
time
i
suggest
and
that
determining
whether
equal
time
must
be
granted
and
they're
arranging
to
give
it
are
far
more
burdensome
than
simply
saying
grant
the
equal
time
suggest.
and
it's
the
elements
of
discretion
in
the
fairness
doctrine
and
simply
the
requirement
that
you
act
in
good
faith
and
being
left
judgment
as
to
how
you
present
the
opposing
points
of
view
which
give
that
flexibility
and
make
it
much
easier
to
comply
with.
let
met
take
as
an
illustration
if
i
may,
it
proves
the
handling
of
a
program
that
appeared
on
january
27
or
january
28,
an
interview
which
would
be
on
the
non-exempt
category
between
eric
sevareid
and
eric
hoffer.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
i
didn't
want
to
just
to
fight
him
--
mr.
archibald
cox
this
--
hoffer
is
a
controversial
character
and
he
speaks
in
a
controversial
manner.
following
this
program
in
order
to
it
have
comply
with
the
notion
of
fairness,
cbs
a
week
later,
had
four
columnists
comment
on
hoffer
and
his
program
gave
each
i
would
judge
two
or
three
minutes.
one
of
them
called
him
a
garrulous
old
war
fret
and
went
on
to
criticize
him.
another
was
a
--
mr.
archibald
cox
yes
and
eric
sevareid
was
interviewing
him.
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
no,
no,
excuse
me.
i've
fallen
into
mixing
my
r's
and
a's,
i'm
sorry.
the
four
were
columnists
of
different
points
of
view.
mario
jimenez
who
said
he
would
be
dangerous
if
he
were
younger.
william
buckley
who
said
he
was
fine;
a
representative
of
core,
roy
innis
who
said
that
he
was
a
racist
but
he
was
an
honest
man
and
he
would
like
the
opportunity
to
convert.
so
there
were
a
variety
of
appraisals
of
hoffer.
now,
that
would
seem
to
me
to
cover
the
notion
of
fairness
but
under
this
regulation,
one
would
--
after
the
tape
was
made
or
if
it
were
live
broadcast
it
was
a
mistake
that
if
it
were
a
live
broadcast
you've
had
to
go
over
the
whole
thing.
well,
it
gets
off
to
a
start
where
i
can't
find
very
many
doubts
but
pretty
soon
one
finds
eric
sevareid
saying
we
have
an
intellectual
running
for
president
last
spring
and
summer
and
senator
mccarthy.
he
doesn't
think
much
of
you
as
a
philosopher,
what
do
you
think
about
him?
and
hoffer
said
well,
i
didn't
read
what
he
said.
i'll
tell
you
one
thing.
i've
always
thought
the
country
is
lucky.
we
would
have
been
--
we
were
lucky
when
that
so
and
so
didn't
get
elected
president.
you'd
have
a
yogi
sitting
in
the
white
house
bumbling
under
his
goddamn
nose
there,
see.
and
he
referred
to
senator
mccarthy
as
a
so
and
so
and
a
yogi
mumbling.
perhaps,
a
personal
attack,
perhaps
not
then
he
went
on
and
referred
to
him
as
vain
and
out
of
merit.
i
would
think
one
would
have
to
mark
that
up
as
a
personal
attack
in
senator
mccarthy
time
for
reply.
then
comes
a
rather
interesting
and
puzzling
one
where
hoffer
referred
to
this
young
mccarthy,
i
--
says
the
most
treacherous
people
in
the
world.
well,
is
that
an
identified
group
to
whom
you
give
notice?
if
i
were
the
lawyer
and
they
consulted
me,
i
think
i'd
say
well
let's
go
on,
we'll
come
back
to
that
one
later.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
--
mr.
archibald
cox
if
it's
in
a
new
way,
i
assume
that
the
original
man
now
has
to
have
an
opportunity
to
reply
and
certainly
and
a
third
person
that
is
attacking
in
the
reply
has
to
have
time
to
reply
and
that
actually
happen
to
this
instance.
some
of
the
commentators
on
hoffer
maligned
third
persons.
so,
if
we
lived
up
to
the
personal
attack
rule
we'd
have
to
give
them
time
for
reply.
now,
in
this
instance
i
go
on,
it
gets
on
a
little
further
with
nothing
that
would
seem
to
be
seriously
questionable.
but
somewhat
later,
eric
sevareid
said,
“do
you
see
any
of
these
young
negro
leaders
coming
up
that
strikes
you
as
something
in
part?
hoffer,
“phony,
phony,
look
at
that
less
begotten
cleaver,
a
sewer
rat
if
there
ever
was
one
talking
about
soul
and
eyes,
it's
all
on
manure
if
you
ask
me.”
well
that's
what
i
came
up
for
personal
attack
and
the
right
to
reply
if
they
can
find
him
it.
then
although
cleaver
has
had
plenty
of
opportunity
to
state
his
view
and
also
they
were
these
comic
then
it
goes
and
criticizes
the
barristers
club
of
san
francisco
for
being
cowardly
in
accepting
cleaver's
address
to
them
in
the
party.
and
i
suppose
the
barristers
club
of
san
francisco
would
be
entitled
to
come
in
and
then
toward
the
end,
there
is
a
reference
to
arthur
m.
schlesinger,
jr.
saying
that
the
trouble
with
him
is
he
has
had
to
live
with
schlesinger
all
his
life.
whether
that's
a
personal
attack
or
not,
i
don't
know.
mr.
archibald
cox
but
i
would
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
then
i
would
have
a
much
different
case
to
deal
with.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
would
have
a
harder
case.
i
would
have
the
problem
then
which
i
take
it
is
really
not
in
this
case
if
we
take
seriously
what
the
commission
says
and
that
is
whether
what
the
commission
is
trying
to
do
is
to
provide
a
private
remedy.
but
the
commission
says
it
isn't
doing
that.
it
denies
any
purpose
to
do
that.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
but
of
course
it's
a
remedy
for
even
telling
the
truth.
mr.
archibald
cox
it's
unnecessarily
broad
and
it's
labeled
it
truth.
now,
i
would,
should
say
just
one
thing
more
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
can't
tell
you
whether
i
would
be
asked
to
make
the
argument
in
another
case.
mr.
archibald
cox
it
would
--
that
case
would
be
distinguishable
and
i
would
then
have
to
argue.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
would
--
well,
i
don't,
i
would
have
a
much
harder
time.
i
would
then
have
to
argue
whether
the
new
york
times
case
excludes
a
private
remedy
for
what
used
to
be
a
tort
in
the
form
of
a
right
of
reply
as
distinguished
from
one
of
damages
and
that
would
be
a
much
harder
case
than
i
have
here.
i
don't
think
i'd
be
ashamed
to
argue
that
new
york
times
should
be
extended
to
that
situation.
i
do
want
to
say
just
a
word
about
the
supposedly
exempt
categories
of
cases.
of
course
the
news
documentary
like
the
clu
clux
clan
illustration
in
our
exhibit
or
the
eric
sevareid
broadcast
that
i
referred
to
and
i
commend
to
you
as
broadcast
on
the
death
of
jack
ruby
which
was
certainly
about
a
matter
of
public
importance
as
another
illustration.
those
today
would
be
what
the
commission
calls
exempt.
but
look
what
the
commission
says
on
page
232
of
the
fact
record.
mr.
archibald
cox
because
they
are
part
of
the
news
program.
of
course
it's
an
incredible
distinction
because
it
makes
eric
sevareid's
exemption
depend
whether
he
broadcast
within
certain
time
limits
or
outside
those
limits.
it
makes
the
“face
the
nation”
exempt
because
it
comes
sunday
afternoon.
but
if
you
had
a
special
program
on
wednesday
morning
or
wednesday
evening
not
exempt.
its
--
passes
my
understanding
why
those
mechanical
things
should
make
so
much
difference.
but
the
commission
itself
said
in
paragraph
5
on
page
232
that
the
fairness
doctrine
is
applicable
to
this
exempt
categories
then
skipping
a
few
lines
to
after
the
--
he
stresses
the
considerable
discretion
the
licensee
has
which
says
in
the
case
of
the
personal
attack
there
is
not
the
same
latitude
as
there
is
in
other
examples
of
the
fairness
doctrine.
and
over
on
the
top
of
page
233,
that's
our
revision
requires
that
fairness
be
met
either
by
the
licensee's
action
of
fairly
presenting
the
contrasting
viewpoint
on
the
attack
issue.
in
other
words,
in
the
case
of
the
powell
broadcast,
you
must
run
around
and
get
congressman
conyers,
congressman
pepper,
his
wife,
judge
levy
and
the
others
and
read
what
they
have
to
say
or
otherwise
state
what
their
position
is.
or
else
you
must
allow
that
particular
group,
the
person,
the
opportunity
to
respond.
so
really
this
is
not
very
much
a
difference.
the
sum
total
difference
in
the
case
of
powell
broadcast
is
that
instead
of
having
to
offer
the
time
to
the
particular
individual
you
may
present
what
they
have
to
say
on
the
issue,
that
powell
raised
by
the
attack.
i
think
the
seventh
circuit
was
quite
right
in
saying
that
that's
an
illusory
exemption.
now,
may
i
just
take
a
minute
to
address
myself
to
the
point
which
though
i've
slided
it
by
misjudging
my
time,
we
do
regard
as
being
a
very
great
importance
and
that
is
the
point
that
these
regulations
are
not
authorized
by
the
statute.
and
the
three
things
which
i
would
particularly
emphasize
to
the
court,
first
while
the
statute
uses
the
broad
language
of
public
interest,
convenience
and
necessity,
those
words
might
be
read
in
the
light
of
section
326
which
speaks
in
a
statutory
way
of
the
broadcaster's
freedom
of
speech
and
the
limitation
on
the
commission.
and
also
in
the
light
of
the
fact
that
not
once,
not
twice
but
three
times
the
legislative
process
rejected
proposals
to
put
broadcasters
under
duties
which
really
can't
be
distinguished
from
the
duties
of
the
commission
has
now
sought
to
put
them
under.
the
proposal
in
1927
at
one
time
was
that
there
should
be
an
allowance
of
equal
treatment
for
the
discussion
of
any
question
affecting
the
public
and
the
senate
cut
that
down
to
equal
time
for
political
candidates.
in
1933,
the
senate
passed
a
require
--
and
the
house
passed
a
requirement
requiring
that
those
speaking
in
support
of
are
--
in
opposition
to
any
candidate
for
public
office
or
in
presentation
of
views
on
public
questions
be
given
equal
time
and
that
was
killed
by
veto
and
failed
to
become
law.
now,
that's
really
indistinguishable
from
the
political
editorial
regulation.
and
then
in
1933,
when
the
communications
act
was
before
congress
there
was
a
proposal
to
broaden
section
315
to
allow
equal
time
on
any
public
question
to
be
voted
on
in
any
election
or
by
a
government
agency
and
that
was
killed.
and
the
point
that
we
make
is
that
in
this
area,
which
does
trespass
on
journalistic
freedom,
freedom
of
speech
and
press
that
a
commission
should
not
be
found
entitled
in
the
very
general
words
of
this
legislation
to
impose
this
kind
of
restriction
until,
and
i
am
quoting
justice
roberts
in
cantwell
and
connecticut,
“the
policymaking
body
has
given
the
real
central
issue
careful
and
purposeful
consideration”
and
all
we
know
about
what
congress
did
is
that
it
rejected
essentially
similar
proposal.
now,
the
last
point
i
would
make
is
with
reference
to
the
consideration
of
the
fairness
doctrine
in
1959.
at
that
time,
as
the
government's
brief
points
out,
the
congress
amended
section
315,
the
equal
time
provision
for
political
candidate
so
as
to
exempt
certain
kinds
of
news
programs.
at
the
same
time,
it
said
nothing
in
the
exemption
that
shall
have
the
effect
of
freeing
any
broadcaster
from
the
duty
of
fairness
and
it
is
argued
that
this
was
a
ratification
of
the
fairness
doctrine.
may
i
just
take
two
minutes
to
finish
this
line
of
thought.
mr.
archibald
cox
thank
you
sir.
we
don't
have
to
resolve
that
question
here
because
in
explaining
the
fairness
doctrine
to
the
congressional
committees
at
that
very
time
the
representatives
of
the
commission
emphasized
two
limitations
that
this
regulations
override
and
ignore
its
gradual
increase
in
censorship
that
brings
us
here.
one
of
them
was
the
explanation
that
the
broadcaster
has
full
and
complete
authority
subject
only
to
later
review
of
his
whole
operation
as
i
say
will
stress
to
the
congressional
committees
that
considered
the
subject.
and
the
second
statement
was
that
when
it
comes
to
the
application
of
the
overall
fairness
standard,
a
licensee
can
exercise
discretion
as
to
which
viewpoints
are
entitled
to
be
expressed
and
which
spokesman
are
entitled
to
be
heard
with
the
exception
of
qualified
candidates
from
public
office.
now,
neither
of
those
remains
the
case
under
the
challenged
regulation
and
we
think
therefore
that
this
certainly
doesn't
meet
the
test
of
the
most
explicit
statutory
authorization
and
that
there
is
certainly
has
been
no
careful
and
purposeful
consideration
of
this
kind
of
a
breach
of
the
freedom
of
the
press
by
the
policymaking
body
and
consequently
we
think
under,
even
if
these
question
statutory
interpretation
were
otherwise
fairly
balance
as
maybe
it
is.
in
the
cases
like
green
and
mccray,
united
states
and
ruble
and
others
of
this
kind
and
the
policy
of
requiring
the
legislative
body
to
face
up
to
this
question
before
the
court
has
to
decide
require
holding
that
these
regulations
are
not
authorized
by
the
statute.
mr.
archibald
cox
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
outset
of
the
--
my
argument,
there
are
three
semantic
differences,
perhaps
i
should
add
a
fourth
now
between
the
point
of
view
expressed
by
the
solicitor
general
and
the
point
of
view
that
we
submit
to
the
court.
the
first
is
that
this
case
involves
the
personal
attack
and
political
editorial
rules
and
does
not
involve
a
general
attack
on
the
fairness
doctrine.
the
rules
are
very
precise.
they
provide
that
if
a
broadcaster
expresses
a
particular
kind
of
idea,
if
he
criticizes
a
public
official
in
a
way
that
may
be
regarded
as
an
attack
upon
his
honesty,
character,
integrity,
or
like
personal
qualities
whatever
that
may
mean
then
certain
obligations
attached
to
it
and
we
submit
to
the
court
and
i
will
try
to
show
in
more
detail
in
my
argument
that
those
obligations
attached
to
the
expression
of
a
particular
idea
or
kind
of
idea,
the
one
that
is
constitutionally
protected,
are
much
more
onerous
than
any
obligations
imposed
by
the
fairness
doctrine.
and
i
may
say
that
this
is
true
of
those
kinds
of
programs
that
are
characterized
as
exempt
under
the
regulation
that
the
commission
has
a
special
brand
of
the
fairness
doctrine
and
one
that
the
solicitor
general
in
the
statement
the
solicitor
general
would
have
read
if
he
had
trouble
to
read
paragraph
5
to
the
court,
that
said,
“unlike
the
fairness
doctrine
in
general,
there
are
special
obligations
where
there
is
something
that
can
be
characterized
as
a
personal
attack
even
in
a
news
program.”
now,
the
second
semantic
difference
goes
to
our
reading
of
history.
in
fact
the
other
two
go
to
our
reading
of
history.
we
agree
that
the
--
there
are
certain
expressions
of
regulation
of
the
content
of
broadcast
to
be
found
in
the
commission's
administration
of
the
communications
act.
but
i
think
when
you
come
to
read
those
carefully,
you
will
find
that
they
are
expressed
--
they
are
based
upon
a
view
of
the
first
amendment's
application
to
broadcast
which
is
simply
out
of
keeping
with
modern
interpretation
of
the
constitutional
doctrine
of
the
first
amendment
and
out
of
keeping
with
the
current
facts.
the
best
example
is
the
mayflower
role
which
prohibited
a
broadcast
journalist
from
taking
an
editorial
position
on
anything,
a
position
which
surely
would
not
be
sustained
by
this
court
today.
indeed,
judge
bazelon
recently
observed
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
that
it
may
very
well
be
that
some
vulnerable
fcc
policies
cannot
withstand
constitutional
scrutiny
in
the
light
of
contemporary
understanding
of
the
first
amendment
and
the
modern
proliferation
of
broadcasting
outfits.
the
third
thing
which
i
would
mention
now
simply
to
draw
the
court's
attention
and
i
shall
develop
it
at
more
length
later
is
that
also
the
congress
and
this
court
have
of
course
sustained
certain
regulation
of
broadcasting
and
although
congress
has
spoken
in
the
broad
terms
public
interest
that
the
solicitor
general
emphasizes.
both
congress
and
this
court
have
been
very
careful
to
distinguish
between
regulation
that
has
to
do
with
avoiding
interference,
securing
competent
licensees
dealing
with
the
structure
of
the
industry
as
in
the
chain
broadcasting
cases
on
the
one
side
and
regulation
that
lays
hold
of
what
is
said
on
the
other
side.
that's
not
always
a
clear
line
but
i
would
emphasize
that
in
the
history,
both
sides
of
the
line
come
through
and
not
just
the
side
mentioned
by
the
solicitor
general.
the
clearest
expression
is
by
congress
itself
for
it
declared
in
section
326,
“nothing
in
this
act
shall
be
understood
or
construed
to
give
the
commission
the
power
censorship.
and
no
regulation
or
condition
shall
be
promulgated
by
the
commission
which
will
interfere
with
the
right
of
free
speech
by
broadcast
communication.”
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
--
i'm
not
sure
whether
that
was
in
the
radio
act
of
1927.
it
certainly
came
in
the
communications
act
of
1934.
this
court
in
the
sanders
brothers
case
noted
the
licensing
power
on
the
one
hand
but
said
that
on
the
other
hand,
the
commission
was
given
no
control
over
progress
and
i
would
mention
now
too
although
i
shall
elaborate
it
and
give
you
the
language
later
that
congress
on
three
occasions,
the
congress
on
two
and
the
president
on
one
occasion,
rejected
in
the
legislative
process
attempts
to
put
broadcasters
subject
to
the
duties
essentially
the
same
kind
of
duties
that
the
commission
now
seeks
to
impose
in
these
regulations.
my
other
semantic
difference
for
the
solicitor
general
is
of
course
one
mentioned
by
justice
white
and
that
is
that
nothing
has
come
to
be
better
settled
than
that
regulations
of
speech
are
to
be
judged
on
their
face
by
their
tendency
and
that
the
court
will
not
require
the
nation
to
wait
until
a
test
case
arises
before
it
examines
and
if
they
are
unconstitutional
strikes
down
such
regulation.
and
that
proposition
is
so
well
settled
that
i
don't
stop
to
develop.
mr.
archibald
cox
we
must
of
course
go
ahead
and
do
so
and
show
what
the
tendency
will
be
and
i
--
i
propose
to
build
it.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
think
we
can
show
the
court
that
the
tendency
will
be
--
is
bound
to
be
highly
restrictive
especially
in
terms
of
self-censorship
but
i
realize
that's
a
burden
that
i
at
least
in
the
formal
sense
that
i
have
to
go
forward
and
carry.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
would
think
this
was
a
question
on
which
the
court
would
make
up
its
own
mind
on
that
there
was
not
presumption
in
favor
of
the
fcc
ruling.
we
have
to
persuade
the
court
to
reach
a
different
conclusion
but
i
think
there's
no
presumption
in
its
favor.
now,
we
submit
that
these
regulations
are
invalid
upon
two
primary
grounds.
first,
we
say
that
they
unconstitutionally
abridged
the
freedom
of
speech
and
press
guaranteed
by
the
first
amendment
and
second
that
they
are
invalid
because
they
are
beyond
the
statutory
authority
of
the
communications
commission.
i
shall
deal
with
the
constitutional
issue
first
even
though
the
court
may
never
reach
it
or
because
it
can
and
i'm
inclined
to
think
should
decide
the
case
on
the
statutory
ground.
but
i
deal
with
it
first
because
the
seriousness
of
the
constitutional
question
is
in
our
judgment
an
important
element
in
resolving
the
issue
of
statutory
interpretation.
our
constitutional
argument
proceeds
in
a
series
of
propositions.
the
early
ones
of
which
seem
to
me
to
be
not
seriously
controversial
but
first
we
say
this
case
involves
freedom
of
the
press.
the
electronic
media
are
not
simply
carriers
as
they
have
evolved
in
this
country
and
that
may
be
one
difference
between
what
president
hoover
was
thinking
of
in
1924
and
the
situation
as
it
exists
today.
broadcasters'
activities
in
the
field
of
public
affairs
are
virtually
indistinguishable
from
those
of
newspapers.
they
have
editors,
producers,
reporters,
their
own
news
services
which
add
to
the
new
services
of
upi
and
the
ap.
their
functions
i
submit
make
them
one
of
the
very
instruments
which
this
court
characterized
in
mills
and
alabama
as
agencies
which
the
framers
of
our
constitution
thoughtfully
and
deliberately
selected
to
improve
our
society
and
keep
it
free.
second,
i
would
point
out
that
the
challenge
regulations
lay
hold
of
speech
itself.
this
is
the
fact
which
distinguishes
every
other
case
involving
broadcasting
that
has
come
before
this
court
because
they
all
had
to
do
with
the
economic
regulation
of
the
industry.
we're
not
talking
about
fair
labor
standards
and
labor
relations
or
the
antitrust
laws
here.
we're
talking
about
a
regulation
which
says
as
i
indicated
earlier
that
if
you
expressed
ideas
for
certain
character,
ideas
which
can
be
described
as
an
attack
on
somebody's
integrity
or
honesty
or
other
personal
qualities.
or
if
you
put
someone
on
the
air
who
may
engage
in
those
attacks,
then
you
run
the
risk
of
having
to
carry
certain
obligations
which
are
onerous.
but
if
you
stir
clear
of
those
ideas,
if
you
prefer
blandness
to
biting
criticism
of
the
shabby
yourself
seeking
then
you're
safe,
then
you
don't
have
to
worry
and
we
think
that
this
is
fairly
characterized
as
a
regulation
of
speech
itself.
not
only
that,
but
of
course
the
speech
that
this
regulation
lays
hold
of
is
the
kind
of
speech
which
this
court
characterized
in
the
new
york
times
case
as
lying
at
the
very
center
of
the
constitutionally
protected
area
of
free
expression.
by
its
own
terms
these
regulation
applies
only
when
one
is
discussing
questions
of
public
importance.
the
speech
in
the
red
lion
case
was
certainly
within
the
new
york
times
case
and
this
is
true
under
all
the
other
commission
rulings
under
the
fairness
doctrine
or
the
personal
attack
rule
which
deal
with
criticisms
of
public
officials
for
the
most
part
or
people
engaged
in
controversy
upon
public
issues.
my
third
proposition
is
that
the
challenge
regulations
abridge
the
freedom
of
speech
in
ways
which
unless
justify
violate
the
first
amendment.
inhibition
as
well
as
prohibition
of
protected
expression
is
forbidden
by
the
first
amendment.
that's
perfectly
clear
from
cases
like
talley
and
california,
thomas
and
collins,
lamont
and
postmaster
general.
here,
the
commission
as
i
said
before
says
you
may
not
criticize
in
the
way
that
we
would
call
a
personal
attack
unless
you're
prepared
to
scrutinize
what
has
gone
out
over
the
air
and
see
whether
it
contains
any
personal
attacks.
to
give
notice
in
the
transcript,
to
offer
free
time
for
reply
and
then
engage
in
the
negotiations
necessary
to
arrange
the
reply
disrupting
your
other
program,
clearing
time
on
a
nationwide
hookup
if
that
is
necessary.
now,
we
submit
that
attaching
these
burdens
inhibits
the
broadcast
criticism
and
political
editorial
in
four
ways.
i'm
going
to
state
them
and
then
i'm
going
to
turn
to
some
concrete
example
in
an
effort
to
show
exactly
how
they
would
work.
first,
attaching
this
condition
deprives
the
broadcaster
of
his
freedom
of
journalistic
judgment.
even
the
most
fair-minded
manager
of
a
radio
or
television
station
will
think
twice
about
offering
criticism
of
this
kind
if
the
price
he
must
pay
is
surrendering
his
judgment
as
to
what
is
in
the
public
interest.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
we
think
that
it
is
an
essential
part
of
these
regulations
if
i
understand
your
honor
that
they
allowed
hold
of
the
content
of
the
program.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
would
say
if
--
mr.
archibald
cox
there
would
still
be
burdens
that
we
were
made
to
carry.
mr.
archibald
cox
because
of
saying
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
it
would
but
i
don't
think
i
need
to
stand
on
that
because
i
think
the
problem
of
self
censorship
is
very
rarely.
i
suppose
that
had
it
been
effect
in
the
new
york
times
case
that
the
new
york
times
would
have
paid
that
judgment
rather
than
suppress
the
advertisement
that
was
bought
that
there
would
still
have
been
held
to
be
a
violation
of
free
speech
but
we
do
stress
and
we
think
that
it
is
fairly
clear
that
this
will
have
an
effect
on
the
content.
but
i
would
assert
that
i
can
stand
on
both
grounds.
again,
remember
that
the
time
taken
to
complying
with
this
government
order
is
necessarily
taken
from
the
time
that
broadcaster
might
think
and
might
reasonably
think
and
even
rightly
think
it
was
more
in
the
public
interest
in
which
it
was
more
in
the
public
interest
to
broadcast
something
else.
next,
i
would
emphasize
that
there
are
very
considerable
administrative
burdens
and
trouble
to
which
these
regulations
put
the
broadcasting.
he
must
scrutinize
his
scripts
and
see
whether
they
contain
personal
attacks.
consult
with
lawyers
and
probably
more
lawyers
in
order
to
find
out
what
duties
arise
out
of
a
particular
program.
this
--
the
sending
out
of
the
notice
and
the
tape
which
isn't
a
big
thing
for
enlarged
outfit
but
this
regulation
applies
to
little
stations
too.
it's
a
matter
of
clearing
time
for
reply
which
may
vary
from
no
problem
at
all
to
a
really
very
troublesome
and
serious
problem
including
an
effect
on
the
goodwill
of
the
audience.
and
then
there's
the
matter
of
negotiating
the
reply
and
finally
the
matter
of
often
defending
oneself
before
a
commission
and
its
staff
which
has
a
life
and
death
power
over
the
broadcasters
through
its
control
of
licensee.
the
financial
cost
of
giving
the
risk
that
you
must
give
time
whenever
you
put
a
free
swinging
controversialist
on
the
air
is
not
inconsiderable
and
most
of
all
there
is
the
pressure
for
self-censorship
which
these
things
create.
now,
i
would
like
to
take
a
few
concrete
illustrations
to
show
how
as
we
see
it
these
regulations
are
bound
to
work.
let
me
call
your
attention
first
to
a
broadcast
of
eric
sevareid
which
appears
beginning
on
page
15
and
runs
over
to
page
16
of
the
record
in
the
second
volume,
the
one
that
the
solicitor
general
objects
to.
but
we
offer
this
simply
as
examples
of
how
these
regulations
would
work
out.
i
could
make
up
examples
but
it's
more
persuasive
to
use
real
ones
and
that's
the
reason
they
bring
them
into
court.
mr.
sevareid
gave
what
i
think
you
would
agree
was
an
impartial
and
fair
presentation
of
henry
luce's
contributions
to
american
journalism.
toward
the
end
he
said,
it's
on
the
bottom
of
page
16,
he
referred
to
time
and
said
the
time
strained
in
every
sentence
to
avoid
dullness
which
often
meant
straining
proof.
many
journalists
have
always
distrusted
it.
nearly
all
have
always
read
it.
now,
i
suppose
that
that
is
an
attack
on
an
unidentified
group,
the
time
editors
and
it
raises
a
question
about
their
intellectual
integrity
and
if
it
were
directed
at
me,
i
would
think
that
was
an
attack
upon
my
personal
character.
at
the
time
eric
sevareid
said
this,
he
was
not
subject
to
any
inhibitions.
but
considering
today
if
he
were
confronted
with
the
same
situation
preparing
his
evening
broadcast
at
4
o'clock
in
the
afternoon,
what
does
he
do?
is
this
a
personal
attack
or
isn't
it?
well,
he
might
answer
that
it
is
and
then
he
subjects
every
station
that
carries
this
program
to
all
these
burdens.
should
he
do
that
or
should
he
trim
his
sales
a
bit?
or
maybe
he
doesn't
know.
so
what,
does
he
call
up
his
lawyer?
the
result,
all
too
often
is
likely
today
that
mr.
sevareid
will
decide,
“well
i
better
not
say
just
what
i
think.
i
better
find
something
that's
little
safer,
a
little
more
bland
or
remain.”
of
course
this
is
of
great
concern.
he
may
decide
to
transfer
to
a
medium
where
he
would
not
be
subject
to
this
kind
of
inhibition.
mr.
archibald
cox
not
at
all,
page
6
(a)
of
the
appendix
to
the
rtnd
brief.
mr.
archibald
cox
rtnd,
the
--
yes,
my
brief.
that
is
in
the
appendix.
mr.
archibald
cox
page
6
(a),
it's
in
the
very
back
the
next
to
the
last
page
of
the
brief.
mr.
archibald
cox
it
certainly
a
very
important
part.
when
during
a
presentation
of
views
on
the
controversial
issue
of
public
importance,
an
attack
is
made
upon
the
honesty,
character
or
integrity
or
like
personal
qualities
of
any
--
of
an
identified
person
or
a
group.
now,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
editors
of
time
magazine
are
an
identified
group
and
them
saying
that
they
strain
truth
and
that
many
reporters
have
always
distrusted
them,
attacks
because
attack
means
only
adversely
criticized
their
integrity
or
like
personal
qualities,
whatever
that
may
mean.
i
don't
see
how
--
i
would
have
thought
this
was
clearly
a
personal
attack
but
it's
enough
for
my
purposes
to
suggest
that
it
raises
terribly
serious
questions
and
that
because
he
couldn't
be
sure,
eric
sevareid
would
then
be
put
under
pressure
to
tref.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
would
think
that
--
i
would
think
that
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
would
think
a
discussion
--
i
would
think
a
discussion
of
one
of
our
great
national
magazines
and
its
reliability
was
an
issue
of
public
importance.
i
would
be
amazed
if
the
commission
drew
this
distinction.
but
let
me
--
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
--
all
of
this
instance
mr.
justice
--
mr.
archibald
cox
there
are
many.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
that
is
the
core
of
what
i
have
to
say
with
respect
to
this
sevareid
broadcast.
mr.
archibald
cox
we
say
that
this
regulation
is
beyond
the
power
of
congress
and
further
that
congress
hasn't
authorized
the
commission
to
issue
it,
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
both
point,s
i
would
emphasize.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
wouldn't
want
to
say
that
no
one
could
think
of
any
other
kind
of
remedy
and
of
course
if
the
attack
were
not
the
kind
of
criticism
that
is
privileged
under
the
new
york
times
case.
if
it
were
willfully
false
then
we
would
have
an
entirely
different
situation.
but
this
applies
when
it
is
true
and
a
fortiori
when
it
is
just
a
result
of
a
mistake
when
every
word
is
true.
let
me
give
you
another
illustration
of
--
mr.
archibald
cox
how
what?
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
he
has
access
if
he
is
a
public
figure
and
this
is
an
issue.
he
has
access
to
a
number
of
media
that
frequently,
he
will
have
had
an
opportunity
to
present
his
views
on
these
questions
in
all
kinds
of
ways
and
on
many
occasions.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
yes.
but
i
would
emphasize
if
merely
all
these
--
i
would
emphasize
mr.
justice,
i
don't
mean
to
rush
over
what
you
say,
i
gripped
it
completely
but
i
would
emphasize
it
in
nearly
all
of
these
cases.
the
other
person
has
ample
opportunity
to
present
his
views
and
may
have
presented
it
but
the
commission
automatically
comes
along
and
applies
this
requirement.
now,
let
me
take
a
somewhat
different
aspect
of
the
matter.
in
the
second
half
of
this
document,
quite
toward
the
end,
at
a
page
that
is
numbered
55,
is
this
transcript
of
an
appearance
of
adam
clayton
powell
on
“face
the
nation”,
a
panel
show
like
meet
the
press.
it
begins
at
55
and
i
see
now
a
very
troublesome
passage
although
there
are
some
that
might
be
thought
troublesome
until
page
59
when
mr.
powell
says,
“that
anyone
that
has
an
estranged
wife
is
automatically
inherited
a
life.”
i
would
suppose
that
that
was
a
personal
attack
upon
his
wife
and
mr.
powell
was
certainly
discussing
question
of
public
importance
at
the
time
of
this
peruse
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
mean
it's
hard
to
identify
because
they're
--
no,
the
defect
is
--
the
thinner
one,
tpward
the
end
and
i
am
on
page
59,
way
much
farther
long
in
the
second
volume.
the
second
59,
there
are
two
59s.
mr.
archibald
cox
it
was
printed
unfortunately,
i
am
very
sorry
for
that.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
am
pointing
out
that
the
first
personal
attack
is
on
mr.
powell's
wife.
now,
over
on
page
53
--
63,
one
of
the
reporters
questioning
mr.
powell
says,
“does
that
answer
the
question?”
it's
italicized,
“whether
you
advocate
what
rap
brown
and
stokely
carmichael
have
been
advocating,
guerilla-type
warfare
in
the
cities
of
our
country?”
that
would
seem
to
be
a
personal
attack
by
mr.
dean
on
stokely
carmichael
and
rap
brown.
now,
of
course
both
rap
brown
and
stokely
carmichael
have
ample
access
to
the
press.
both
indeed
have
been
on
cbs
shows.
i
don't
think
there
is
any
question
of
fairness
in
getting
their
views
before
the
public
but
nevertheless
under
these
regulations,
there
would
be
a
very
real
question
of
whether
cbs
did
not
have
to
go
through
all
this
machinery
of
giving
them
time
for
reply.
over
on
page
66,
toward
the
bottom,
you
will
see
a
reference
to
representative
conyers
of
detroit
who
was
referred
to
as
a
black
judas.
i
would
think
that
that
was
calling
a
man
a
communist
is
a
personal
attack
as
the
commission
has
said
in
its
opinion
on
this
matter
calling
one
a
black
judas
would
seem
to
me
to
be
a
personal
attack.
over
on
page
67,
mr.
powell
says
that
claude
pepper
was
one
of
the
number
racists
on
money
sellers
committee
against
them.
this
again,
i
should
suppose
though
i
can't
say
without
any
assurance
because
the
government
persists
in
ignoring
these
questions,
i
should
suppose
was
a
personal
attack.
if
it's
a
personal
attack
as
the
commission
has
ruled
to
say
that
the
john
burke's
society
attempted
through
a
front
organization
to
have
a
standard
reference
book
removed
from
the
library
in
visalia,
california.
but
then
i
would
suppose
this
kind
of
thing
was
rather
clearly
a
personal
attack.
and
then
there's
a
reference
to
judge
matthew
levy
for
issuing
an
indecent,
obscene,
illegal,
unilateral
article.
i
would
think
that
that
too
might
well
be
a
personal
attack.
now
the
point
i'm
trying
to
make
is
that
after
this
program
which
was
a
free
live
discussion,
the
work
would
begin,
i'm
going
through
it
and
going
over
these
things,
such
questions
as
justice
stewart
raised
as
to
whether
it
really
was
a
personal
attack.
in
many
instances
might
have
be
taken
into
account,
it
might
be
decided
that
it
wasn't
mr.
justice,
i
agree.
but
the
thing
is
that
nobody
knows
for
sure
and
some
of
my
colleagues
think
that
there
are
many
more
personal
attacks.
but
there
would
be
at
least
six
or
eight
of
them
in
that
single
“face
the
nation”
program
and
all
those
instances
in
which
the
obligations
would
fall
upon
the
network
and
all
cbs
stations
to
carry
out
the
duty
of
offsetting
its
programming
substituting
offers
of
free
time
for
reply
and
the
replies
in
the
place
of
what
matters
which
in
its
editorial
judgment
it
thought
were
more
important.
mr.
archibald
cox
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
using
concrete
illustrations
before
the
luncheon
recess,
the
point
that
i
was
trying
to
make
was
that
these
regulations
have
--
i
think
an
obvious
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
an
obvious
tendency
to
induce
a
broadcaster
and
remember
we're
dealing
with
local
programs
as
well
as
the
nationwide
programs
that
i
used
as
illustrations.
to
press
a
broadcaster
to
prefer
the
bland
pundit,
to
debating
critic,
to
the
shabby
or
self-seeking
to
avoid
putting
on
programs
like
“face
the
nation”
or
their
local
equivalent
roundup
of
reporters
on
a
radio
show,
free
swinging
controversialist
and
diocese
moderators
or
people
who
would
just
stare
the
discussion
away
from
the
criticism
of
government
officials
and
other
public
figures
rather
than
target
it.
and
we
think
that
a
regulation
of
which
has
that
kind
of
impact
on
the
actual
conduct
of
broadcast
journalist
both
because
of
the
burdens
and
even
more
because
of
the
pressure
toward
itself
censorship,
is
a
violation
of
the
first
amendment
unless
it
is
justified
by
some
overriding
public
entries.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
we
would
draw
a
sharp
distinction
and
i
intend
to
elaborate
this
a
little
later
between
the
fairness
doctrine
itself
and
the
personal
attack
and
political
editorial
regulations.
i
am
going
to
explain
in
just
a
moment,
it
comes
a
little
bit
a
step
further
out
(voice
overlap)
the
differences
in
our
position
on
this.
mr.
archibald
cox
because
to
be
quite
candid
mr.
chief
justice,
i
am
speaking
for
a
number
of
parties
here.
they
take
somewhat
different
positions
and
they
have
asked
me
to
state
their
respective
positions
on
that
question
as
carefully
as
i
can
and
i
can
do
it
barely
just
one
step
farther
along
the
way.
mr.
archibald
cox
as
i
was
saying,
we
come
to
the
question
of
justification.
the
justification
advanced
by
the
government
in
its
brief
is
that
restrictions
upon
the
normal
liberty
of
the
press
or
normal
freedom
of
expression
here
are
necessary
in
broadcasting
because
in
order
to
assure
the
public,
access
to
what
the
government
defines
as
a
fair
or
balanced
presentation.
in
oral
argument,
the
solicitor
general
added
as
further
justification
that
the
government
owns
the
airwaves
and
that
what
it
gives
is
a
privilege.
the
addition
of
a
--
of
those
labels
or
concepts,
it
seems
to
me,
don't
really
advance
the
argument
where
the
government
gives
a
privilege
such
as
the
second
class
mail
privilege.
it
still
has
a
duty
to
administer
in
ways
that
don't
inhibit
expression
or
inhibit
the
press.
one
could
use
the
second
class
mail
privilege
as
a
way
of
discouraging
magazines
from
criticizing
public
officials
or
other
public
figure
as
justice
brennan
said
in
the
lamont
case.
if
the
government
wishes
to
withdraw
subsidy
or
privilege,
it
must
do
so
by
means
and
on
terms
which
do
not
endanger
first
amendment
rights
and
i
come
back
here
to
the
point
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
think
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
will
make
two
points
mr.
justice.
first
and
that
was
one
i
tried
to
emphasize
early
in
my
argument
that
broadcasters
are
not
merely
carriers.
broadcasters
as
the
industry
has
grown
up
and
as
they
are
treated
by
the
communications
act
are
themselves
journalists
and
they
have
views
to
express.
and
i
would
think
it
very
questionable
whether
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
there
would
raise
a
very
different
question
than
this
case.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
think
that
the
--
i
think
first
they
haven't
been
treated
as
carriers
and
if
i
would
emphasize
that
we
deal
with
the
case
in
this
context.
second,
i
come
back
to
another
point
that
i
attached
great
importance
to.
and
that
is
that
this
isn't
blank,
say,
taking
two
hours
of
time
which
must
be
given
in
the
morning
to
a
certain
kind
of
programs
that
would
be
established
in
some
way.
this
says
that
the
amount
of
time
we
take
from
you
depends
on
what
you
say
in
conducting
your
own
journalistic
function.
it's
not
like
saying
we'll
take
the
use
of
your
lower
field
so
many
days
a
week
for
a
public
purpose.
it
says
we
will
take
a
day
for
every
time
you
criticize
the
government
or
any
other
public
figure.
this
is
attached
to
the
expression
of
particular
idea.
and
i
think
that
distinguishes
completely
the
cases
of
whether
the
government
could
take
two
hours
a
day
and
say
that
this
shall
be
available
for
certain
kinds
of
public
interest
programs
of
which
will
be
proscribed
--
well,
in
some
nondiscriminatory
and
constitutional
way.
i
don't
--
i
really
don't
think
that
case
may
bother
us
here
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
because
of
the
link
between
the
two.
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
no.
i
have
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
am
afraid
i've
misled
your
honor
if
i
have
given
the
impression
that
that's
my
position.
now,
let
me
come
--
because
i
think
the
argument
about
public
ownership
really
falls
out
and
we're
back
to
the
constitutional
problem.
and
there's
a
question
whether
this
justification
we're
trying
to
provide
the
public
with
a
fair
and
balanced
opinion
is
sufficient.
now,
there
are
two
answers
to
the
argument
with
the
desire
to
provide
fairness
and
balance
in
the
case
of
the
press
is
a
justification
for
these
regulations.
one,
attacks
the
adequacy
of
the
alleged
justification.
this
is
an
argument
which
is
advanced
in
its
strongest
form
by
the
national
broadcasting
company.
the
national
broadcasting
company
says
the
imposition
by
an
arm
of
government
of
its
standard
of
fairness
on
the
press
and
the
enforcement
of
that
obligation
by
governmentally
imposed
sanctions
is
contrary
to
the
constitutional
guarantee
of
freedom
of
the
press.
this
is
an
argument
of
which
might
be
put
a
little
less
absolutely
and
indeed
in
my
brief
i
have
put
much
the
same
argument
a
little
less
absolutely.
as
we
assert
that
the
basic
postulate
of
the
first
amendment
is
that
the
public
interest
in
excess
to
a
variety
of
ideas
is
to
be
secured
by
relying
on
the
diversity
and
multiplicity
of
expression.
developing
in
the
absence
of
the
restraint
--
of
a
restraint
and
that
the
government
is
unable
to
show
anything
here,
it
would
justify
departing
from
that
basic
posture.
now,
i
come
to
your
question
mr.
chief
justice
in
a
sense
to
where
i
said
i
was
afraid
i
have
misled
mr.
justice
white.
the
logic
of
that
argument
thus
put
in
question
the
fairness
doctrine.
i
don't
want
to
mislead
you
and
indeed
the
logic
of
my
argument
that
if
you
do
this
then
you
must
do
that
puts
in
question
to
some
extent
of
the
fairness
doctrine
because
that
essentially
is
a
part
of
the
doctrine.
now,
i
am
going
to
have
--
because
of
the
passage
of
time,
i'm
going
to
have
to
leave
the
development
of
this
--
that
constitutional
argument
to
our
briefs.
the
essence
of
it
is
the
government
notions
of
fairness
of
impartiality
are
a
violation
of
the
first
amendment
that
if
in
some
circumstances
that
may
be
conjured
up.
there
is
sufficient
factual
justification
for
government
intervention.
there
is
no
such
condition
in
the
broadcasting
industry
today
partly
because
of
the
proliferation
of
stations
which
are
10
times
what
they
were
on
the
early
1940s.
partly
because
broadcasting
is
only
one
of
many
media
and
indeed
it
adds
to
the
access
people
otherwise
would
have
two
opinion
and
if
i'm
not
going
through
it
but
if
--
when
you
think
about
the
red
lion
case,
you
noticed
how
the
dialogue
developed
across
media.
it's
a
very
good
indication
that
this
notion
of
the
insulated
listener
that
the
commission
hypothesized
is
not
realistic.
now,
the
argument
that
i
just
mentioned
which
i
say
i
do
refer
your
honors
to
our
briefs
is
not
made
by
cbs.
cbs'
position
which
all
of
us
joined
except
that
we
make
the
other
argument
too,
emphasizes
the
peculiarly
restrictive
character
of
the
challenged
regulation
and
it
asserts
that
even
if
we
suppose
that
there
is
a
justification
for
government
regulation
of
the
fairness
of
broadcasters
in
order
to
ensure
the
public
access
to
a
diversity
of
opinion,
still
these
regulations
with
their
peculiarly
restrictive
character
cannot
be
sustained
because
they
imposed
much
heavier
and
more
burdens
and
restrictions
than
are
necessary
mr.
chief
justice
to
secure
fairness
and
therefore
they
fall
under
the
least
restrictive
alternative
doctrine.
i
hope
that
that
answers
your
questions
as
you
put
it
earlier.
mr.
archibald
cox
about
the
cbs
argument
would
concede
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
the
fairness
doctrine.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
cbs
argument
would
concede
the
--
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
as
i
understand
it,
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
whether
there
--
it
can
be
some
midterm
scrutiny,
i'm
not
sure
that
they've
addressed
themselves
to
that
because
it
isn't
involved.
of
course
the
more
precise
scrutiny
you
put,
the
more
it
becomes
an
inhibition
on
saying
particular
things
and
that
is
an
important
part
of
our
argument.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
think
--
i
wouldn't
--
just
mr.
justice
homes
once
said,
“all
constitutional
differences
that
end
--
come
down
to
differences
in
degree.”
i
think
the
difference
in
degree
--
difference
is
in
principle
and
i
would
submit
that
they
are
matters
of
principle
are
these
mr.
chief
justice
between
the
fairness
doctrine
and
the
personal
attack
rule
and
let
me
try
and
develop
them
and
see
if
they
don't
really
answer
your
question.
and
then
i'm
going
to
again
with
concrete
illustrations
attempt
to
show
at
least
once
how
they
work
out.
the
principle
difference
is,
and
i
think
there
are
differences
in
principle
are
these.
the
fairness
doctrine
looks
at
overall
performance.
the
personal
attack
rule
calls
virtually
for
a
line
by
line,
item
by
item
script.
second,
the
fairness
doctrine
left
discretion
to
the
broadcaster
in
deciding
what
views
deserve
presentation
and
it
holds
him
only
to
a
reasonable
judgment.
the
personal
attack
rules
apply
an
automatic
rule
and
they
leave
the
broadcaster
no
room
for
judgment
in
discerning
what
is
a
personal
attack
and
when
he
must
give
reply
also
where
they
do
give
him
the
benefit
of
acting
in
good
faith
with
respect
to
imposing
any
fine
for
having
failed
to
give
notice.
the
personal
--
the
fairness
doctrine
leaves
discretion
as
to
whether
a
reply
is
needed
to
achieve
fairness.
if
so
who
may
most
appropriately
make
the
reply.
but
the
personal
attack
rule
is
absolutely
automatic.
you
must
give
time,
adequate
time.
you
must
give
it
to
a
particular
individual
and
where
the
generality
of
the
fairness
doctrine
made
it
still
less
restrict
makes
it
less
restrictive
when
it's
coupled
with
the
ideas
of
reasonableness
and
good
faith.
the
vagueness
of
the
terms
character,
honesty
or
other
personal
qualities,
personal
attack
identified
goal.
when
you
apply
them
item
by
item,
increase
the
--
in
pressures
towards
self-censorship
because
if
you're
wrong
these
consequences
all
fall
in
and
the
pressure
is
to
stir
clear
of
the
dividing
line.
now,
i
think
perhaps
a
very
good
illustration
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
archibald
cox
if
the
station
--
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
true
but
the
granting
--
the
equal
time
i
suggest
and
that
determining
whether
equal
time
must
be
granted
and
they're
arranging
to
give
it
are
far
more
burdensome
than
simply
saying
grant
the
equal
time
suggest.
and
it's
the
elements
of
discretion
in
the
fairness
doctrine
and
simply
the
requirement
that
you
act
in
good
faith
and
being
left
judgment
as
to
how
you
present
the
opposing
points
of
view
which
give
that
flexibility
and
make
it
much
easier
to
comply
with.
let
met
take
as
an
illustration
if
i
may,
it
proves
the
handling
of
a
program
that
appeared
on
january
27
or
january
28,
an
interview
which
would
be
on
the
non-exempt
category
between
eric
sevareid
and
eric
hoffer.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
i
didn't
want
to
just
to
fight
him
--
mr.
archibald
cox
this
--
hoffer
is
a
controversial
character
and
he
speaks
in
a
controversial
manner.
following
this
program
in
order
to
it
have
comply
with
the
notion
of
fairness,
cbs
a
week
later,
had
four
columnists
comment
on
hoffer
and
his
program
gave
each
i
would
judge
two
or
three
minutes.
one
of
them
called
him
a
garrulous
old
war
fret
and
went
on
to
criticize
him.
another
was
a
--
mr.
archibald
cox
yes
and
eric
sevareid
was
interviewing
him.
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
no,
no,
excuse
me.
i've
fallen
into
mixing
my
r's
and
a's,
i'm
sorry.
the
four
were
columnists
of
different
points
of
view.
mario
jimenez
who
said
he
would
be
dangerous
if
he
were
younger.
william
buckley
who
said
he
was
fine;
a
representative
of
core,
roy
innis
who
said
that
he
was
a
racist
but
he
was
an
honest
man
and
he
would
like
the
opportunity
to
convert.
so
there
were
a
variety
of
appraisals
of
hoffer.
now,
that
would
seem
to
me
to
cover
the
notion
of
fairness
but
under
this
regulation,
one
would
--
after
the
tape
was
made
or
if
it
were
live
broadcast
it
was
a
mistake
that
if
it
were
a
live
broadcast
you've
had
to
go
over
the
whole
thing.
well,
it
gets
off
to
a
start
where
i
can't
find
very
many
doubts
but
pretty
soon
one
finds
eric
sevareid
saying
we
have
an
intellectual
running
for
president
last
spring
and
summer
and
senator
mccarthy.
he
doesn't
think
much
of
you
as
a
philosopher,
what
do
you
think
about
him?
and
hoffer
said
well,
i
didn't
read
what
he
said.
i'll
tell
you
one
thing.
i've
always
thought
the
country
is
lucky.
we
would
have
been
--
we
were
lucky
when
that
so
and
so
didn't
get
elected
president.
you'd
have
a
yogi
sitting
in
the
white
house
bumbling
under
his
goddamn
nose
there,
see.
and
he
referred
to
senator
mccarthy
as
a
so
and
so
and
a
yogi
mumbling.
perhaps,
a
personal
attack,
perhaps
not
then
he
went
on
and
referred
to
him
as
vain
and
out
of
merit.
i
would
think
one
would
have
to
mark
that
up
as
a
personal
attack
in
senator
mccarthy
time
for
reply.
then
comes
a
rather
interesting
and
puzzling
one
where
hoffer
referred
to
this
young
mccarthy,
i
--
says
the
most
treacherous
people
in
the
world.
well,
is
that
an
identified
group
to
whom
you
give
notice?
if
i
were
the
lawyer
and
they
consulted
me,
i
think
i'd
say
well
let's
go
on,
we'll
come
back
to
that
one
later.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
--
mr.
archibald
cox
if
it's
in
a
new
way,
i
assume
that
the
original
man
now
has
to
have
an
opportunity
to
reply
and
certainly
and
a
third
person
that
is
attacking
in
the
reply
has
to
have
time
to
reply
and
that
actually
happen
to
this
instance.
some
of
the
commentators
on
hoffer
maligned
third
persons.
so,
if
we
lived
up
to
the
personal
attack
rule
we'd
have
to
give
them
time
for
reply.
now,
in
this
instance
i
go
on,
it
gets
on
a
little
further
with
nothing
that
would
seem
to
be
seriously
questionable.
but
somewhat
later,
eric
sevareid
said,
“do
you
see
any
of
these
young
negro
leaders
coming
up
that
strikes
you
as
something
in
part?
hoffer,
“phony,
phony,
look
at
that
less
begotten
cleaver,
a
sewer
rat
if
there
ever
was
one
talking
about
soul
and
eyes,
it's
all
on
manure
if
you
ask
me.”
well
that's
what
i
came
up
for
personal
attack
and
the
right
to
reply
if
they
can
find
him
it.
then
although
cleaver
has
had
plenty
of
opportunity
to
state
his
view
and
also
they
were
these
comic
then
it
goes
and
criticizes
the
barristers
club
of
san
francisco
for
being
cowardly
in
accepting
cleaver's
address
to
them
in
the
party.
and
i
suppose
the
barristers
club
of
san
francisco
would
be
entitled
to
come
in
and
then
toward
the
end,
there
is
a
reference
to
arthur
m.
schlesinger,
jr.
saying
that
the
trouble
with
him
is
he
has
had
to
live
with
schlesinger
all
his
life.
whether
that's
a
personal
attack
or
not,
i
don't
know.
mr.
archibald
cox
but
i
would
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
then
i
would
have
a
much
different
case
to
deal
with.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
would
have
a
harder
case.
i
would
have
the
problem
then
which
i
take
it
is
really
not
in
this
case
if
we
take
seriously
what
the
commission
says
and
that
is
whether
what
the
commission
is
trying
to
do
is
to
provide
a
private
remedy.
but
the
commission
says
it
isn't
doing
that.
it
denies
any
purpose
to
do
that.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
but
of
course
it's
a
remedy
for
even
telling
the
truth.
mr.
archibald
cox
it's
unnecessarily
broad
and
it's
labeled
it
truth.
now,
i
would,
should
say
just
one
thing
more
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
can't
tell
you
whether
i
would
be
asked
to
make
the
argument
in
another
case.
mr.
archibald
cox
it
would
--
that
case
would
be
distinguishable
and
i
would
then
have
to
argue.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
would
--
well,
i
don't,
i
would
have
a
much
harder
time.
i
would
then
have
to
argue
whether
the
new
york
times
case
excludes
a
private
remedy
for
what
used
to
be
a
tort
in
the
form
of
a
right
of
reply
as
distinguished
from
one
of
damages
and
that
would
be
a
much
harder
case
than
i
have
here.
i
don't
think
i'd
be
ashamed
to
argue
that
new
york
times
should
be
extended
to
that
situation.
i
do
want
to
say
just
a
word
about
the
supposedly
exempt
categories
of
cases.
of
course
the
news
documentary
like
the
clu
clux
clan
illustration
in
our
exhibit
or
the
eric
sevareid
broadcast
that
i
referred
to
and
i
commend
to
you
as
broadcast
on
the
death
of
jack
ruby
which
was
certainly
about
a
matter
of
public
importance
as
another
illustration.
those
today
would
be
what
the
commission
calls
exempt.
but
look
what
the
commission
says
on
page
232
of
the
fact
record.
mr.
archibald
cox
because
they
are
part
of
the
news
program.
of
course
it's
an
incredible
distinction
because
it
makes
eric
sevareid's
exemption
depend
whether
he
broadcast
within
certain
time
limits
or
outside
those
limits.
it
makes
the
“face
the
nation”
exempt
because
it
comes
sunday
afternoon.
but
if
you
had
a
special
program
on
wednesday
morning
or
wednesday
evening
not
exempt.
its
--
passes
my
understanding
why
those
mechanical
things
should
make
so
much
difference.
but
the
commission
itself
said
in
paragraph
5
on
page
232
that
the
fairness
doctrine
is
applicable
to
this
exempt
categories
then
skipping
a
few
lines
to
after
the
--
he
stresses
the
considerable
discretion
the
licensee
has
which
says
in
the
case
of
the
personal
attack
there
is
not
the
same
latitude
as
there
is
in
other
examples
of
the
fairness
doctrine.
and
over
on
the
top
of
page
233,
that's
our
revision
requires
that
fairness
be
met
either
by
the
licensee's
action
of
fairly
presenting
the
contrasting
viewpoint
on
the
attack
issue.
in
other
words,
in
the
case
of
the
powell
broadcast,
you
must
run
around
and
get
congressman
conyers,
congressman
pepper,
his
wife,
judge
levy
and
the
others
and
read
what
they
have
to
say
or
otherwise
state
what
their
position
is.
or
else
you
must
allow
that
particular
group,
the
person,
the
opportunity
to
respond.
so
really
this
is
not
very
much
a
difference.
the
sum
total
difference
in
the
case
of
powell
broadcast
is
that
instead
of
having
to
offer
the
time
to
the
particular
individual
you
may
present
what
they
have
to
say
on
the
issue,
that
powell
raised
by
the
attack.
i
think
the
seventh
circuit
was
quite
right
in
saying
that
that's
an
illusory
exemption.
now,
may
i
just
take
a
minute
to
address
myself
to
the
point
which
though
i've
slided
it
by
misjudging
my
time,
we
do
regard
as
being
a
very
great
importance
and
that
is
the
point
that
these
regulations
are
not
authorized
by
the
statute.
and
the
three
things
which
i
would
particularly
emphasize
to
the
court,
first
while
the
statute
uses
the
broad
language
of
public
interest,
convenience
and
necessity,
those
words
might
be
read
in
the
light
of
section
326
which
speaks
in
a
statutory
way
of
the
broadcaster's
freedom
of
speech
and
the
limitation
on
the
commission.
and
also
in
the
light
of
the
fact
that
not
once,
not
twice
but
three
times
the
legislative
process
rejected
proposals
to
put
broadcasters
under
duties
which
really
can't
be
distinguished
from
the
duties
of
the
commission
has
now
sought
to
put
them
under.
the
proposal
in
1927
at
one
time
was
that
there
should
be
an
allowance
of
equal
treatment
for
the
discussion
of
any
question
affecting
the
public
and
the
senate
cut
that
down
to
equal
time
for
political
candidates.
in
1933,
the
senate
passed
a
require
--
and
the
house
passed
a
requirement
requiring
that
those
speaking
in
support
of
are
--
in
opposition
to
any
candidate
for
public
office
or
in
presentation
of
views
on
public
questions
be
given
equal
time
and
that
was
killed
by
veto
and
failed
to
become
law.
now,
that's
really
indistinguishable
from
the
political
editorial
regulation.
and
then
in
1933,
when
the
communications
act
was
before
congress
there
was
a
proposal
to
broaden
section
315
to
allow
equal
time
on
any
public
question
to
be
voted
on
in
any
election
or
by
a
government
agency
and
that
was
killed.
and
the
point
that
we
make
is
that
in
this
area,
which
does
trespass
on
journalistic
freedom,
freedom
of
speech
and
press
that
a
commission
should
not
be
found
entitled
in
the
very
general
words
of
this
legislation
to
impose
this
kind
of
restriction
until,
and
i
am
quoting
justice
roberts
in
cantwell
and
connecticut,
“the
policymaking
body
has
given
the
real
central
issue
careful
and
purposeful
consideration”
and
all
we
know
about
what
congress
did
is
that
it
rejected
essentially
similar
proposal.
now,
the
last
point
i
would
make
is
with
reference
to
the
consideration
of
the
fairness
doctrine
in
1959.
at
that
time,
as
the
government's
brief
points
out,
the
congress
amended
section
315,
the
equal
time
provision
for
political
candidate
so
as
to
exempt
certain
kinds
of
news
programs.
at
the
same
time,
it
said
nothing
in
the
exemption
that
shall
have
the
effect
of
freeing
any
broadcaster
from
the
duty
of
fairness
and
it
is
argued
that
this
was
a
ratification
of
the
fairness
doctrine.
may
i
just
take
two
minutes
to
finish
this
line
of
thought.
mr.
archibald
cox
thank
you
sir.
we
don't
have
to
resolve
that
question
here
because
in
explaining
the
fairness
doctrine
to
the
congressional
committees
at
that
very
time
the
representatives
of
the
commission
emphasized
two
limitations
that
this
regulations
override
and
ignore
its
gradual
increase
in
censorship
that
brings
us
here.
one
of
them
was
the
explanation
that
the
broadcaster
has
full
and
complete
authority
subject
only
to
later
review
of
his
whole
operation
as
i
say
will
stress
to
the
congressional
committees
that
considered
the
subject.
and
the
second
statement
was
that
when
it
comes
to
the
application
of
the
overall
fairness
standard,
a
licensee
can
exercise
discretion
as
to
which
viewpoints
are
entitled
to
be
expressed
and
which
spokesman
are
entitled
to
be
heard
with
the
exception
of
qualified
candidates
from
public
office.
now,
neither
of
those
remains
the
case
under
the
challenged
regulation
and
we
think
therefore
that
this
certainly
doesn't
meet
the
test
of
the
most
explicit
statutory
authorization
and
that
there
is
certainly
has
been
no
careful
and
purposeful
consideration
of
this
kind
of
a
breach
of
the
freedom
of
the
press
by
the
policymaking
body
and
consequently
we
think
under,
even
if
these
question
statutory
interpretation
were
otherwise
fairly
balance
as
maybe
it
is.
in
the
cases
like
green
and
mccray,
united
states
and
ruble
and
others
of
this
kind
and
the
policy
of
requiring
the
legislative
body
to
face
up
to
this
question
before
the
court
has
to
decide
require
holding
that
these
regulations
are
not
authorized
by
the
statute.
