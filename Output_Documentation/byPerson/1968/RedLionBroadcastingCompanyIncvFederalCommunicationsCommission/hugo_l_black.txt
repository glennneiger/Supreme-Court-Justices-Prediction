may

how
you

quotation

your

open
this
slightest
opening
of

jar?
justice

well,
maybe
they
might
argue
this
or
just
slight
opening
of
the
door?
justice

black
that's
where
it
gets
you,
what
it
gets
to
discussion
though.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
a
beautiful
metaphor,
a
beautiful
piece
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
sure
it's
quite
precise.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that's
why
we
got
to
--
what
we
got
to
judge
is
whether
this
trying
to
pry
it
wide
open
or
leave
it
just
tightly.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
but
i
didn't
think
that
quite
fit
in
that
position.
maybe
it
does.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
if
your
argument
boiled
down
to
the
fact
if
you
do
not
--
you
think
the
rule
should
not
be
judged
as
to
its
validity
on
its
face.

validity
on
its

justice

l.
black
is
there
not
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
one
question?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
the
1927
act,
its
successor,
i
believe
was
1930
have
a
similar
provision
in
it,
the
statute
itself?
justice
hugo
l.
black
radio
control?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
those
acts
disclaim
any
purpose
to
allow
censorship
of
any
kind?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
the
opinion
that
either
they
are
passed
in
one
of
those
laws
or
there
were
offered
provisions
to
the
effect
that
there
should
be
no
censorship
exercised?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
would
assume
that
indicated
probably
that
the
congress
didn't
consider
that
requiring
equal
time
for
censorship?
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
did
that
appear,
the
act,
the
first
time?
when
was
that
first
in
the
act?
justice
hugo
l.
black
mr.
solicitor
general
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
would
it
bother
you
--
you
have
just
stated
an
instance
which
is
an
illustration
of
why
you
object
to
the
rule.
now,
would
you
--
would
it
bother
you
to
get
to
that
rule
where
it's
printed,
tell
us
the
part
of
it
which
puts
on
the
burden
that
you
say
is
censorship?
justice

black
which
we
arguably
--

hugo
l.
black
what
page?

what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
alright.
in
this
i
think
will
be
core
of
your
argument
against
the
rule?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
all
of
it
now?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
i
mean
is
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
core
of
your
objections.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
one
other
question?
now,
let's
assume
that
is
the
core
of
all
them
practically
that
the
board,
the
commission
has
seen
fit
to
provide
that
when
a
public
attack,
attacking
an
individual's
integrity,
integrity
of
a
group
has
been
allowed
to
take
place
over
the
television,
is
it
your
argument
that
it
is
beyond
the
power
of
congress
or
of
its
acting
subsidiary
you
might
say
the
commission
to
provide
any
kind
of
protection
such
as
this
for
the
man?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
--
that
is
the
real
basis
of
this
argument?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
that
there'd
be
no
relief
that
the
man
could
get
from
the
radio
station
and
permitted
him
to
be
personally
attacked
in
his
integrity
or
character.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
how
can
he
get
that
to
the
public?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
could
the
man
attacked
have
any
chance
to
get
in
a
statement
to
the
public
that
it's
false
or
that
it's
not
true?
justice
hugo
l.
black
mr.
solicitor
general,
it
seems
to
me
like
the
argument
perhaps
for
the
past
three
quarters
of
an
hour
has
been
devoted
to
an
attack
on
the
rules
as
ambiguous
and
not
because
of
lack
of
authority
or
power
of
the
board
to
issues
to
some
kind
of
rule.
what
do
say
about
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
seems
to
me
it
is
just
(voice
overlap)
mainly
it
has
been
an
attack
on
the
language
of
this
rule?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
want
to
ask
you
one
other
question.
do
you
think
the
issues
are
here
sufficiently
precise,
sufficiently
clear
that
we
can
pass
on
whether
or
not
we
should
pass
on
whether
or
not
the
board
does
have
power
to
issue
some
kind
of
regulation,
the
nature
of
this
one
in

of
a
personal
attack,
or
the
issues
that
