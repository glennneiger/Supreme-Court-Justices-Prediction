justice
potter
stewart
when
did
you
say
the
premier
was
published?
justice
potter
stewart
'64.
justice
potter
stewart
was
that
all
clear
back
at
the
time
that
this
red
lion
episode
occurred
that
it
was
the
obligation
of
red
lion
to
not
only
to
give
an
opportunity
to
the
person
whose
character
have
been
attacked,
but
also
do
it
at
no
expense
to
him?
justice
potter
stewart
all
just
glancing
through
the
appendix
and
i
haven't
read
it
carefully.
there
seems
to
be
an
indication
that
many
of
these
broadcasting
companies
and
they
were
great
many
that
broadcast
this
particular
speech.
justice
potter
stewart
many
of
them
seem
to
take
the
view
that
their
obligation
was
met
by
this
simple
offer
of
free
time
if
you
want
to
pay
for
it.
justice
potter
stewart
of
time,
of
time.
justice
potter
stewart
or
a
showing
that
he
was
he
was
a
pauper
or
something
like
that.
justice
potter
stewart
i
understand
your
submission
as
to
the
importance
and
necessity
of
it's
being
free
time,
but
i
--
my
question
is
as
you
understood
i
know
was
whether
or
not
that
was
also
clear
back
at
the
time
of
red
lion
broadcast.
justice
potter
stewart
and
if
--
i
lose
track
on
the
chronology
here,
the
fairness
primer
was
published
when?
justice
potter
stewart
in
the
hargis
broadcast
was
a
little
later
that
year,
wasn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
the
hargis
--
justice
potter
stewart
65?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
solicitor
general,
are
you
going
to
talk
specifically
about
the
editorializing
rules?
justice
potter
stewart
those
regulations
has
identical
application
to
both
radio
and
television?
justice
potter
stewart
there
are
no
differences?
justice
potter
stewart
television
is
so
much
more
local,
isn't
it
as
a
generality?
justice
potter
stewart
by
the
chains
but
each
station
has
a
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
but
except
for
catv,
each
particular
station
has
a
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
less
diameter?
justice
potter
stewart
they
apply
mr.
solicitor
general,
the
rule
applies
as
i
read
it
here
only
with
respect
to
a
candidate
not
with
respect
to
an
issue
like
a
bond
issue
or
a
tax
levy
--
justice
potter
stewart
whether
or
not
any
license
is
involved?
justice
potter
stewart
how
does
it
work?
how
would
it
work
in
an
election
like
was
held
this
week
in
los
angeles
where
i
think
there
were
about
10
candidates.
justice
potter
stewart
if
the
--
if
the
station
endorses
a
candidate
the
result
would
be
that
nine
other
people
get
on
the
air
free
to
attack
him.
so
i
should
think
the
station
would
endorse
its
enemy?
justice
potter
stewart
it
doesn't
explicitly
specify
equal
time,
does
it?
justice
potter
stewart
none
of
these
rules.
justice
potter
stewart
neither
one
of
these
rules?
justice
potter
stewart
a
reasonable
opportunity
then
to
respond?
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
see.
justice
potter
stewart
excuse
me.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
except
that
it
wasn't
made
during
the
presentation
of
views
on
a
controversial
issue
of
public
importance.
justice
potter
stewart
it
was
made
on
the
occasion
of
the
death
of
henry
luce.
there's
nothing
controversial
about
that.
justice
potter
stewart
what
page?
justice
potter
stewart
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
it
doesn't
--
as
i
understood
the
chief
justice's
question
it
does
not
--
it
suggest
an
answer
but
it
doesn't
give
an
explicit
answer
because
as
i
understood
his
question
was
what
would
you
concede
--
what
would
cb
--
the
cbs
argument
concede
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
the
government
could
do
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
that
fgovernment
could
do.
justice
potter
stewart
just
if
the
general
fairness
on
that
balance
set
determination
of
the
licensed
period
on
the
renewal,
you
have
to
see
how
generally
fair
they've
been,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
is
the
one
that
the
solicitor
general
told
us
you
were
going
to
--
justice
potter
stewart
you
told
him,
you're
going
to
talk
about?
justice
potter
stewart
this
is
eric
hoffer?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
not
james
hoffer?
justice
potter
stewart
exempt
because
they're
part
of
a
news
program?
justice
potter
stewart
a
news
interview
you
say
is
a
term
of
art
and
that
would
include
the
program
the
“face
the
nation?”
justice
potter
stewart
not?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
but
do
i
understand
that
the
program
like
“face
the
nation”
is
a
news
interview?
justice
potter
stewart
although
that
is
planned
in
advance
it
is
not
spot
news,
generally,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
are
there
definitions
of
“news

is
