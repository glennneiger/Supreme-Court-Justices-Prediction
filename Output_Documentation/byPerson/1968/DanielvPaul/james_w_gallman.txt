mr.
james
w.
gallman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
lake
nixon
used
to
be
called
the
nixon
farm.
it's
223
acres,
mostly
of
hillside.
you
get
to
it
by
following
a
street
called
12th
street
at
little
rock
which
becomes
a
country
road,
pave
and
at
a
point
if
you
know
exactly
of
where
it
is,
you
can
turn
right
without
a
help
of
a
sign,
you
can
climb
a
steep
hill
and
you
can
come
down
and
you
can
find
lake
nixon.
the
232
acres
as
i
say
--
mr.
james
w.
gallman
sir,
(voice
overlap)
no
sir.
it's
made
by
a
dam
put
in
a
small
creek
which
doesn't
run
the
year
around
and
the
road
way,
traverses
the
top
of
the
dam.
and
this
is
how
you
arrive
at
the
nixon
farm.
mr.
james
w.
gallman
not
on
the
highway.
mr.
james
w.
gallman
there
is
a
way
to
come
in
from
the
back
and
perhaps
that
road
is
paved
now.
the
last
time
i
was
there,
you
could
not
get
in
from
the
rear,
that
is
from
the
west
and
north
because
the
road
was
too
rocky
and
it
would
--
you
just
couldn't
be
sure
you
make
it.
now,
this
mere
little
valley
two
hills
comes
down
to
the
small
lake
which
i
would
guess
the
swimming
area
is
perhaps
two
acres.
i
wouldn't
stick
with
that,
but
it
is
a
relatively
small
area.
there
are
some
shallow
back
water
to
the
south
and
west
from
the
where
the
creek
comes
that
has
--
now,
it
is
usually
kind
of
green
and
lousy
and
not
attractive.
and
after
you
go
over,
after
you
come
in
on
the
dam,
you
can
turn
right
and
go
out
to
what's
about
authority
or
50-acre
pasture
i
would
guess
where
mr.
nixon
used
to
keep
his
cows
and
where
i
used
to
shoot
birds.
now,
mr.
nixon
disposed
of
this
i
learn
from
the
record
about
1962.
since
then,
it's
been
operated
by
mr.
and
mrs.
paul.
if
as
i
say
is
a
shallow
little
lake,
it
has
a
place
where
you
drafts
rather
small
little
building.
this
lunch
counter
or
dining
room
we're
talking
about
is
i
guess
8
by
12
feet
perhaps.
it
has
--
i've
never
seen
the
miniature
golf
course
if
they
have
that,
and
i
assume
it
does.
but
mostly,
there
is
a
little
spit
of
land
that
runs
out
into
these
2
acres
of
water
on
which
people
sung
and
from
which
they
can
top
off
and
get
wet.
now,
except
near
the
dam,
the
water
is
not
to
my
knowledge
over
your
head.
as
i
say
it
is
a
shallow
lake,
it's
particularly
unattractive
in
the
late
summer
because
of
health
reasons
and
because
of
lack
of
fresh
water
coming
into
it.
mr.
james
w.
gallman
the
record
says
a
100,000
which
surprises
me.
i
haven't
seen
it
since
the
paul's
have
had
it.
mr.
james
w.
gallman
they
sure
would
have
to
come
in
there
bumper
to
bumper
because
i'd
been
in
there
i
think
in
the
years
in
the
five
months
time.
it
only
operates
from
sometime
in
may
until
school
starts
about
labor
day
of
that
thing.
i
think
what
we're
dealing
with
here
is
an
incidentally,
i
have
little
apprehension
that
little
rock
air
force
base
would
find
this
place,
i
don't
think
they
could.
first
place
is
15
miles
in
the
city
limits
of
little
rock,
you
go
through
little
rock
and
then
you
go
northwest
of
little
rock
some
15
miles
further
to
get
to
the
little
rock
air
force
base
which
should
make
somewhere
near
45
to
50
miles
before
you
get
from
the
air
force
base
to
this
little
farm.
mr.
james
w.
gallman
i
understand
that
from
the
record
that
it
appeared
at
least
in
once
a
year
in
the
air
force
magazine
at
the
--
or
the
newspaper
at
the
air
base.
i
understand
it
appeared
once
in
little
rock
today,
i
understand
--
mr.
james
w.
gallman
yes
sir,
they
do.
mr.
james
w.
gallman
i
believe
they
could.
i
didn't
say
they
could.
mr.
james
w.
gallman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
yesterday,
we
were
discussing
the
nixon
farm
which
under
the
calls
was
improved
and
became
a
more
of
a
place
of
business
as
we've
observed
from
the
record.
the
--
with
the
advent
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964,
the
paul
chose
to
operate
their
establishment
under
the
guise
of
the
private
club
as
this
evidence
from
the
record
here.
this
was
rejected
out
of
hand
by
the
district
court
and
does
not
even
a
serious
question
in
the
district
court.
it
does
have
one
surprising
effect
of
the
case
though
that
i
think
is
followed
it
all
the
way
through.
if
we
look
at
the
record
in
the
commencement
of
the
case,
we
see
that
it
counsel
for
the
plaintiff
or
for
mrs.
daniel
and
mrs.
kyles
intended
the
trial
based
upon
the
private
club
exception
of
the
1964
act.
now,
this
fell
flat
a
gain
in
point
in
this
regard,
and
that
after,
i
think
the
record
reflects
at
adequate
proof
was
not
brought
in
concerning
the
connection
of
this
business
with
the
commerce
so
that
the
act
apply.
now,
the
district
court
in
view
that
number
one,
that
there
was
no
coverage
under
the
act
because
this
is
not
a
place
of
entertainment.
it
considered
it
a
place
of
participation
or
exercise
or
such
as
that
and
not
one
where
the
one
is
entertained.
and
it
assumed
that
perhaps
some
of
the
items
at
the
place
of
business
had
moved
in
interstate
commerce.
mr.
james
w.
gallman
yes.
mr.
james
w.
gallman
that's
correct.
mr.
james
w.
gallman
that's
correct.
mr.
james
w.
gallman
i
believe
so.
there
was
further
the
question
of
what
connection
the
so-called
lunch
stand,
snack
bar
or
what
have
you
here
had
this
--
with
the
establishment.
that
is
would
it
be
come
under
201
(b)
(4)
or
201
(b)
(2)
restaurant
and
cafeteria
and
lunch
counters
sold
about
so,
principally
it
gave
in
selling
food
for
consumption
on
the
premises.
the
lower
court
felt
that
this
business
of
swimming
and
sun
bathing
and
so
on,
and
that
the
food
that
was
strictly
incidental
and
not
a
major
enterprise
of
the
business.
it
also
rejected
the
idea
that
there
were
two
establishments
here
and
so
as
to
say
that
under
subsection
4
that
there
was
no
covered
establishment
that
would
rankly
entire
establishment
for
that
the
cover
of
the
act.
when
this
case
got
to
the
court
of
appeals,
the
reasoning
was
the
same.
there,
the
court
of
appeals
looked
at
the
two
requirements
or
coverage
under
the
'64
act,
namely
the
commerce
connection
or
the
offer
to
serve
interstate
travelers.
now
again,
i'd
advert
to
the
fact
the
record
below
was
not
developed
with
respect
to
the
offer
to
sell/serve
interstate
travelers.
there
simply
no
questioning
about
it.
it
is
true
that
it
could
be
inferred
from
the
testimony
of
mr.
paul
that
they
would
serve
any
white
person
without
inquiring
about
their
origin.
but
there
is
no
searching
inquiry
at
all
as
to
whether
they
would
restrict
their
service
to
dam
sealers
of
the
area,
that
is
would
leave
the
interstate
traveler
go
elsewhere.
this
really
is
considering
the
geography
of
the
matter,
a
remote
and
isolated
lunch
room
if
that's
what
we're
talking
about.
it's
some
12
miles
from
the
city.
it's
hard
to
get
to
as
i
explained
yesterday
hard
to
find.
the
court
of
appeals
then
approached
it
from
the
standpoint
of
what
did
the
record
show
with
respect
to
commerce,
and
i
know
that
court
had
in
mind
just
as
the
assistant
attorney
general
have
here
that
common
sense
wise,
the
business
must
have
some
connection
with
interstate
commerce.
but
are
we
dealing
with
the
question
of
whether
there
is
sufficient
connection
in
the
area
for
congress
to
legislate?
are
we
dealing
with
the
question
of
whether
under
the
provisions
of
the
act,
a
substantial
part
of
the
food
served
at
the
lunch
room
which
it
serves
as
moot
in
interstate
commerce?
now,
there
were
four
items
mentioned.
hamburgers,
hotdogs,
softdrinks,
and
milk.
it's
argued
by
petitioners
here
that
three
of
the
four
items
had
interstate
arguments.
there
was
no
evidence
about
it.
the
district
court
without
any
evidentiary
support
at
all
said
that
he
suppose
that
some
of
the
ingredients
for
the
hamburgers,
i
suppose
the
flour
had
interstate
origin.
the
drink
i
think
he
laid
aside
because
of
the
legislative
history
of
the
act
indicating
that
it's
the
inquiry
about
the
food,
not
about
the
drink.
he
said
that
there's
some
of
the
ingredients
obviously
came
from
out
of
state
i'm
sure,
as
a
matter
of
common
knowledge,
but
it's
not
in
the
record.
i'm
satisfied
or
i
feel
my
common
sense
tells
me
that
this
establishment
sold
cigarettes,
that
it
sold
candy,
that
it
sold
some
other
items,
gum,
mints,
item
such
as
these,
but
it's
not
in
the
record.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
record
indicates
the
absent.
so,
i
think
this
is
what
they
get
to
when
we
look
for
coverage
under
the
act.
we
find
that
it
was
thought
of
as
a
case
where
there
would
be
a
serious
contest
over
private
or
public
exemption,
and
then
law
and
behold,
that
fell
through.
and
i've
that
the
same
experience
myself
that
you
think
your
case
true,
but
did
not
go
ahead
and
introduce
a
necessary
evidence
to
show
coverage
under
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964.
mr.
james
w.
gallman
no.
mr.
james
w.
gallman
they
were
softdrinks.
i
think
it
reflects
that
too.
mr.
james
w.
gallman
no.
no,
there's
no
liquor
--the
--
it's
indicated
that
no
beer
was
sold.
of
course,
arkansas
is
a
--
mr.
james
w.
gallman
--
package
type
of
state
you
cannot
dispense
liquor
buy
to
drink.
but
this
place
is
always
been
noted
for
no
alcoholic
beverages
of
any
kind.
so,
the
court
of
appeals
approach
is
this.
now,
judge
henny
does
dissented
in
the
court
of
appeals.
he
was
quite
so
sure
that
judge
mahaphy,
the
majority
judge,
was
wrong
about
this
lack
of
evidence
concerning
movement
of
the
food
in
commerce.
he
wanted
to
look
at
some
arkansas
statutes
that
permitted
or
might
be
use
to
prevent
so-called
integration
or
admissions
of
negroes
to
the
so-called
place.
as
saying
well,
there
is
an
ominous
enforcement
act
in
arkansas
that
might
be
use
to
prevent
this
sort
of
thing
so
we
can
say
that
this
practice,
this
discriminatory
practice
of
the
falls
resulted
from
state
action.
so,
he
but
his
disagreement
only
with
this
conclusion
and
contended
of
course
all
the
while
that
there
was
sufficient
evidence
that
interstate
commerce
had
furnished
the
so-called
lunch
room.
now,
the
other
question
i
think
it
deserves
comment
here
is
the
question
of
what
about
this
place
of
entertainment?
basically,
this
is
a
participant
type
amusement
park,
if
we
could
call
it
that.
i'd
rather
call
it
the
farm
but
the
record
doesn't
reflect
that.
but
it
doesn't
have
rights,
it
doesn't
have
the
things
that
you
had
in
the
fifth
circuit
case
of
milk,
where
you
have
11
or
12
complicated
rights
manufactured
out
of
state
and
brought
in
without
any
question.
here,
our
record
concerning
the
equipment
used
for
boating
and
boating
only
that
the
evidence
do
is
not
clear
is
to
where
that
came
from.
now,
there
is
some
indication
that
they
have
about
a
dozen
boats
that
called
puddle
boats.
i
don't
know
what
they
are
exactly,
except
i
think
of
a
kind
where
children
get
only
have
some
wheels,
some
pedals,
they
push
and
the
puddle
in
the
rear
of
the
boat
makes
it
go.
now,
i
think
that's
what
it
is
and
i'm
not
sure
they
have
yatch
whatever
that
is.
now,
this
is
a
very
minor
part
of
the
activities
as
i
understand
the
record.
it
suggested
that
these
where
perhaps
purchased
out
of
state.
judge
mahaphy
in
his
opinion
said
that
it
was
common
knowledge,
boats
was
made
in
arkansas.
there
was
a
reference
to
an
oklahoma
boat
company
to
whom
the
paul's
paid
a
royalty.
but
it
is
not
clear
whether
if
one
ends
in
--
at
one
point,
the
question
is
from
whom
did
you
purchase
the
boats
or
did
you
purchase
a
yatch?
they
say
the
same
company,
meaning
the
same
company
to
whom
the
pay
the
royalties.
but
there's
not
testimony
about
rather
boats
was
made,
where
the
sale
was
made,
where
the
boat
came
from,
did
it
come
from
oklahoma
and
arkansas,
there's
nothing
about
it.
now,
assume
that
the
briefs
that
this
indicate
some
interstate
contact
with
reference
to
that
and
for
that
reason,
we
ought
to
say
that
the
entertainment
here,
these
boats,
move
in
commerce,
and
that
therefore,
this
activity
ought
to
be
a
covered
under
subsubsection
4
of
the
act
of
two
or
one
of
the
act.
we
suggest
that
it's
not
anywhere
near
like
the
miller
case
that
judge
mahaphy
in
his
opinion
was
correct
that
the
evidence
concerning
movement
with
reference
to
amusement
and
entertainment
movement
in
interstate
commerce
is
not
there.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
have
authority
and
has
not
have
a
possibility
of
drilling
on
the
applicability
of
the
title
42
section
1981
and
1982.
mr.
james
w.
gallman
a
--
again,
mr.
paul
was
asked
where
was
the
jukebox
made
and
he
said,
“i
don't
know.”
i
think
the
testimony
into
that.
mr.
james
w.
gallman
in
my
common
knowledge,
i
know
that
everyone
of
them
perhaps
came
through
interstate
commerce
and
i
know
the
jukeboxes
made
elsewhere.
i
don't
have
any
doubt
about
it.
i
think
that's
true.
i
think
--
mr.
james
w.
gallman
the
jukebox
to
play
and
listen
to
i
suppose.
mr.
james
w.
gallman
yes,
sir.
on
a
friday
night
perhaps
a
saturday
night
between
the
last
day
of
may
and
perhaps
labor
day
or
one
of
those
two
nights,
the
establishment
would
have
a
dance.
the
testimony
is
that
a
local
band
would
play
for
that
dance
and
we
would
not
have
entertainers
who
has
move
from
another
state
to
arkansas
to
present
the
performers.
these
were
so-called
amateurs
or
local
musicians.
of
course,
if
you
want
to
know
what
i
know
about,
that
would
say
that
the
jukebox
played
in
intermission
when
the
band
quit.
but
that's
not
in
the
record.
mr.
james
w.
gallman
i
believe
they
have
a
pavilion
your
honor
that
--
i
would
judge
what
it
would
put
in,
something
of
that
sort.
mr.
james
w.
gallman
no.
i
didn't
mean
to
say
that.
there
is
a
dressing
room
next
to
it
there's
a
lunch
counter.
as
i
recall
when
the
paul's
came
in,
they
put
some
more
drafts
down
the
edge
of
this
little
lake
in
the
shallow
water,
and
down
there,
erected
a
floor,
an
outdoor
type
cover
where
this
dancing
took
place.
mr.
james
w.
gallman
well
--
mr.
james
w.
gallman
--
i
think
the
people
danced.
i
think
the
record
shows
that
two
nights
a
week
events.
i
think
the
contention
was
that
it
wasn't
for
watching
others
dance,
it
was
for
people
to
dance
now.
i
would
--
mr.
james
w.
gallman
yes.
mr.
james
w.
gallman
the
district
court
did
and
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
said
perhaps
this
but
still
we
don't
have
any
interstate
connection
as
where
you
know
--
mr.
james
w.
gallman
what
is
mine?
i
have
to
agree
with
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
evidence
--
mr.
james
w.
gallman
well,
i
think
we
can
assemble
some
place
of
entertainment
and
then,
look
for
the
necessary
connection
as
acquired
by
201
(b)
(4)
or
(3),
excuse
me.
now,
it's
--
mr.
james
w.
gallman
--
well,
i
might
refer
to
this,
the
reference
to
excise
taxes
for
example
where
the
cabaret
tax
applied
to
a
20%
tax,
we
used
to
have.
mr.
james
w.
gallman
they
referred
to
the
names
of
the
band
your
honor
as
the
jinx,
pacers,
names
of
this
sort.
i
took
it
from
those
names
that
it
would
be
rock
and
roll
music.
mr.
james
w.
gallman
no,
sir.
to
return
to
the
question
of
mr.
justice
white,
the
cabaret
tax
was
applied
and
it
speaks
of
entertainment
was
applied
to
places
where
a
jukebox
furnished
the
music
for
dancing.
and
there
was
no
performance
as
such
and
those
cases
do
exist
that
i
know
of.
as
i've
said,
the
question
of
the
application
of
the
1981
was
not
before
the
court
of
appeals.
it
appears
in
the
language
brought
enough
to
prohibit
all
discriminatory
contract,
all
discriminatory
action
concerning
contracts.
the
government
i
think
raises
some
very
searching
questions
in
its
brief
concerning
the
impediments
that
might
exist
to
holding
that
1981
or
section
1
of
the
1866
act,
might
it
itself
be
sufficient
here.
i
noticed
that
they
caution
the
court
that
perhaps
this
should
be
characterized
here
as
a
sort
of
public
contract
and
that
the
1866
act
if
it
has
liability
ought
to
be
looked
at
as
referring
to
so-called
public
title
contract.
mr.
james
w.
gallman
sir.
mr.
james
w.
gallman
oh,
yes
your
honor.
i
knew
that
the
court
understand
to
say
there
were
not
jukeboxes
there.
mr.
james
w.
gallman
oh,
yes.
i
believe
it,
it
could
be
it.
mr.
james
w.
gallman
this
without
the
country
you
wouldn't
need
a
permit
for
the
dancing.
mr.
james
w.
gallman
no,
your
honor.
i
didn't
mean
to
--
mr.
james
w.
gallman
and
i
know
they
had
no
permit.
they
got
no
license.
i
think
they
did
have
a
periodic
inspection
by
the
health
department
that
i
point
yesterday
this
post
the
problem
because
sometimes,
their
water
didn't
--
water
supply
wasn't
sufficient
to
keep
the
pool
there
clean,
it
couldn't
be
chlorinated.
so,
there
is
one
point
i
must
raise
and
i
may
have
been
missed
in
this
your
honors.
the
--
i
had
assumed
when
i
was
invited
to
appear
here
that
it
was
perfectly
evident
that
the
reason
because
where
not
in
the
case
was
that
they
have
disposed
of
this
property.
i
found
that
though
arriving
here
and
checking
the
opposing
counsel
that
they
were
under
the
apprehension
that
the
paul's
in
fact
still
own
the
property
but
it
is
my
information
that
they
do
not.
that
they
dispose
of
it
september
26,
1968
through
a
sale,
that
they
reserve
2.75
acres
namely
the
tree
home
sites
own
this
property
for
themselves
but
otherwise
disposed
of
the
property.
now,
i
give
that
to
you
because
i
think
you
ought
to
know.
mr.
james
w.
gallman
well,
it
suggests
from
either
we
might
have
some
effect
on
that
area.
i
do
not
know
what
the
plans
or
the
new
orders
are,
if
they
intend
operate
it
perfectly.
i
can
see
utility
in
there
in
the
city.
mr.
james
w.
gallman
yes,
it's
a
group
of
10
individuals.
they
--
i'm
told
that
they
have
a
connection
with
a
church.
i
believe
they
form
a
private
corporation
to
acquire
this.
they
call
it
the
lake
nixon
incorporated
and
that's
as
much
as
i
know.
mr.
james
w.
gallman
yes.
mr.
james
w.
gallman
thank
you
your
honor,
it's
a
pleasure
to
be
--
mr.
james
w.
gallman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
lake
nixon
used
to
be
called
the
nixon
farm.
it's
223
acres,
mostly
of
hillside.
you
get
to
it
by
following
a
street
called
12th
street
at
little
rock
which
becomes
a
country
road,
pave
and
at
a
point
if
you
know
exactly
of
where
it
is,
you
can
turn
right
without
a
help
of
a
sign,
you
can
climb
a
steep
hill
and
you
can
come
down
and
you
can
find
lake
nixon.
the
232
acres
as
i
say
--
mr.
james
w.
gallman
sir,
(voice
overlap)
no
sir.
it's
made
by
a
dam
put
in
a
small
creek
which
doesn't
run
the
year
around
and
the
road
way,
traverses
the
top
of
the
dam.
and
this
is
how
you
arrive
at
the
nixon
farm.
mr.
james
w.
gallman
not
on
the
highway.
mr.
james
w.
gallman
there
is
a
way
to
come
in
from
the
back
and
perhaps
that
road
is
paved
now.
the
last
time
i
was
there,
you
could
not
get
in
from
the
rear,
that
is
from
the
west
and
north
because
the
road
was
too
rocky
and
it
would
--
you
just
couldn't
be
sure
you
make
it.
now,
this
mere
little
valley
two
hills
comes
down
to
the
small
lake
which
i
would
guess
the
swimming
area
is
perhaps
two
acres.
i
wouldn't
stick
with
that,
but
it
is
a
relatively
small
area.
there
are
some
shallow
back
water
to
the
south
and
west
from
the
where
the
creek
comes
that
has
--
now,
it
is
usually
kind
of
green
and
lousy
and
not
attractive.
and
after
you
go
over,
after
you
come
in
on
the
dam,
you
can
turn
right
and
go
out
to
what's
about
authority
or
50-acre
pasture
i
would
guess
where
mr.
nixon
used
to
keep
his
cows
and
where
i
used
to
shoot
birds.
now,
mr.
nixon
disposed
of
this
i
learn
from
the
record
about
1962.
since
then,
it's
been
operated
by
mr.
and
mrs.
paul.
if
as
i
say
is
a
shallow
little
lake,
it
has
a
place
where
you
drafts
rather
small
little
building.
this
lunch
counter
or
dining
room
we're
talking
about
is
i
guess
8
by
12
feet
perhaps.
it
has
--
i've
never
seen
the
miniature
golf
course
if
they
have
that,
and
i
assume
it
does.
but
mostly,
there
is
a
little
spit
of
land
that
runs
out
into
these
2
acres
of
water
on
which
people
sung
and
from
which
they
can
top
off
and
get
wet.
now,
except
near
the
dam,
the
water
is
not
to
my
knowledge
over
your
head.
as
i
say
it
is
a
shallow
lake,
it's
particularly
unattractive
in
the
late
summer
because
of
health
reasons
and
because
of
lack
of
fresh
water
coming
into
it.
mr.
james
w.
gallman
the
record
says
a
100,000
which
surprises
me.
i
haven't
seen
it
since
the
paul's
have
had
it.
mr.
james
w.
gallman
they
sure
would
have
to
come
in
there
bumper
to
bumper
because
i'd
been
in
there
i
think
in
the
years
in
the
five
months
time.
it
only
operates
from
sometime
in
may
until
school
starts
about
labor
day
of
that
thing.
i
think
what
we're
dealing
with
here
is
an
incidentally,
i
have
little
apprehension
that
little
rock
air
force
base
would
find
this
place,
i
don't
think
they
could.
first
place
is
15
miles
in
the
city
limits
of
little
rock,
you
go
through
little
rock
and
then
you
go
northwest
of
little
rock
some
15
miles
further
to
get
to
the
little
rock
air
force
base
which
should
make
somewhere
near
45
to
50
miles
before
you
get
from
the
air
force
base
to
this
little
farm.
mr.
james
w.
gallman
i
understand
that
from
the
record
that
it
appeared
at
least
in
once
a
year
in
the
air
force
magazine
at
the
--
or
the
newspaper
at
the
air
base.
i
understand
it
appeared
once
in
little
rock
today,
i
understand
--
mr.
james
w.
gallman
yes
sir,
they
do.
mr.
james
w.
gallman
i
believe
they
could.
i
didn't
say
they
could.
mr.
james
w.
gallman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
yesterday,
we
were
discussing
the
nixon
farm
which
under
the
calls
was
improved
and
became
a
more
of
a
place
of
business
as
we've
observed
from
the
record.
the
--
with
the
advent
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964,
the
paul
chose
to
operate
their
establishment
under
the
guise
of
the
private
club
as
this
evidence
from
the
record
here.
this
was
rejected
out
of
hand
by
the
district
court
and
does
not
even
a
serious
question
in
the
district
court.
it
does
have
one
surprising
effect
of
the
case
though
that
i
think
is
followed
it
all
the
way
through.
if
we
look
at
the
record
in
the
commencement
of
the
case,
we
see
that
it
counsel
for
the
plaintiff
or
for
mrs.
daniel
and
mrs.
kyles
intended
the
trial
based
upon
the
private
club
exception
of
the
1964
act.
now,
this
fell
flat
a
gain
in
point
in
this
regard,
and
that
after,
i
think
the
record
reflects
at
adequate
proof
was
not
brought
in
concerning
the
connection
of
this
business
with
the
commerce
so
that
the
act
apply.
now,
the
district
court
in
view
that
number
one,
that
there
was
no
coverage
under
the
act
because
this
is
not
a
place
of
entertainment.
it
considered
it
a
place
of
participation
or
exercise
or
such
as
that
and
not
one
where
the
one
is
entertained.
and
it
assumed
that
perhaps
some
of
the
items
at
the
place
of
business
had
moved
in
interstate
commerce.
mr.
james
w.
gallman
yes.
mr.
james
w.
gallman
that's
correct.
mr.
james
w.
gallman
that's
correct.
mr.
james
w.
gallman
i
believe
so.
there
was
further
the
question
of
what
connection
the
so-called
lunch
stand,
snack
bar
or
what
have
you
here
had
this
--
with
the
establishment.
that
is
would
it
be
come
under
201
(b)
(4)
or
201
(b)
(2)
restaurant
and
cafeteria
and
lunch
counters
sold
about
so,
principally
it
gave
in
selling
food
for
consumption
on
the
premises.
the
lower
court
felt
that
this
business
of
swimming
and
sun
bathing
and
so
on,
and
that
the
food
that
was
strictly
incidental
and
not
a
major
enterprise
of
the
business.
it
also
rejected
the
idea
that
there
were
two
establishments
here
and
so
as
to
say
that
under
subsection
4
that
there
was
no
covered
establishment
that
would
rankly
entire
establishment
for
that
the
cover
of
the
act.
when
this
case
got
to
the
court
of
appeals,
the
reasoning
was
the
same.
there,
the
court
of
appeals
looked
at
the
two
requirements
or
coverage
under
the
'64
act,
namely
the
commerce
connection
or
the
offer
to
serve
interstate
travelers.
now
again,
i'd
advert
to
the
fact
the
record
below
was
not
developed
with
respect
to
the
offer
to
sell/serve
interstate
travelers.
there
simply
no
questioning
about
it.
it
is
true
that
it
could
be
inferred
from
the
testimony
of
mr.
paul
that
they
would
serve
any
white
person
without
inquiring
about
their
origin.
but
there
is
no
searching
inquiry
at
all
as
to
whether
they
would
restrict
their
service
to
dam
sealers
of
the
area,
that
is
would
leave
the
interstate
traveler
go
elsewhere.
this
really
is
considering
the
geography
of
the
matter,
a
remote
and
isolated
lunch
room
if
that's
what
we're
talking
about.
it's
some
12
miles
from
the
city.
it's
hard
to
get
to
as
i
explained
yesterday
hard
to
find.
the
court
of
appeals
then
approached
it
from
the
standpoint
of
what
did
the
record
show
with
respect
to
commerce,
and
i
know
that
court
had
in
mind
just
as
the
assistant
attorney
general
have
here
that
common
sense
wise,
the
business
must
have
some
connection
with
interstate
commerce.
but
are
we
dealing
with
the
question
of
whether
there
is
sufficient
connection
in
the
area
for
congress
to
legislate?
are
we
dealing
with
the
question
of
whether
under
the
provisions
of
the
act,
a
substantial
part
of
the
food
served
at
the
lunch
room
which
it
serves
as
moot
in
interstate
commerce?
now,
there
were
four
items
mentioned.
hamburgers,
hotdogs,
softdrinks,
and
milk.
it's
argued
by
petitioners
here
that
three
of
the
four
items
had
interstate
arguments.
there
was
no
evidence
about
it.
the
district
court
without
any
evidentiary
support
at
all
said
that
he
suppose
that
some
of
the
ingredients
for
the
hamburgers,
i
suppose
the
flour
had
interstate
origin.
the
drink
i
think
he
laid
aside
because
of
the
legislative
history
of
the
act
indicating
that
it's
the
inquiry
about
the
food,
not
about
the
drink.
he
said
that
there's
some
of
the
ingredients
obviously
came
from
out
of
state
i'm
sure,
as
a
matter
of
common
knowledge,
but
it's
not
in
the
record.
i'm
satisfied
or
i
feel
my
common
sense
tells
me
that
this
establishment
sold
cigarettes,
that
it
sold
candy,
that
it
sold
some
other
items,
gum,
mints,
item
such
as
these,
but
it's
not
in
the
record.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
record
indicates
the
absent.
so,
i
think
this
is
what
they
get
to
when
we
look
for
coverage
under
the
act.
we
find
that
it
was
thought
of
as
a
case
where
there
would
be
a
serious
contest
over
private
or
public
exemption,
and
then
law
and
behold,
that
fell
through.
and
i've
that
the
same
experience
myself
that
you
think
your
case
true,
but
did
not
go
ahead
and
introduce
a
necessary
evidence
to
show
coverage
under
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964.
mr.
james
w.
gallman
no.
mr.
james
w.
gallman
they
were
softdrinks.
i
think
it
reflects
that
too.
mr.
james
w.
gallman
no.
no,
there's
no
liquor
--the
--
it's
indicated
that
no
beer
was
sold.
of
course,
arkansas
is
a
--
mr.
james
w.
gallman
--
package
type
of
state
you
cannot
dispense
liquor
buy
to
drink.
but
this
place
is
always
been
noted
for
no
alcoholic
beverages
of
any
kind.
so,
the
court
of
appeals
approach
is
this.
now,
judge
henny
does
dissented
in
the
court
of
appeals.
he
was
quite
so
sure
that
judge
mahaphy,
the
majority
judge,
was
wrong
about
this
lack
of
evidence
concerning
movement
of
the
food
in
commerce.
he
wanted
to
look
at
some
arkansas
statutes
that
permitted
or
might
be
use
to
prevent
so-called
integration
or
admissions
of
negroes
to
the
so-called
place.
as
saying
well,
there
is
an
ominous
enforcement
act
in
arkansas
that
might
be
use
to
prevent
this
sort
of
thing
so
we
can
say
that
this
practice,
this
discriminatory
practice
of
the
falls
resulted
from
state
action.
so,
he
but
his
disagreement
only
with
this
conclusion
and
contended
of
course
all
the
while
that
there
was
sufficient
evidence
that
interstate
commerce
had
furnished
the
so-called
lunch
room.
now,
the
other
question
i
think
it
deserves
comment
here
is
the
question
of
what
about
this
place
of
entertainment?
basically,
this
is
a
participant
type
amusement
park,
if
we
could
call
it
that.
i'd
rather
call
it
the
farm
but
the
record
doesn't
reflect
that.
but
it
doesn't
have
rights,
it
doesn't
have
the
things
that
you
had
in
the
fifth
circuit
case
of
milk,
where
you
have
11
or
12
complicated
rights
manufactured
out
of
state
and
brought
in
without
any
question.
here,
our
record
concerning
the
equipment
used
for
boating
and
boating
only
that
the
evidence
do
is
not
clear
is
to
where
that
came
from.
now,
there
is
some
indication
that
they
have
about
a
dozen
boats
that
called
puddle
boats.
i
don't
know
what
they
are
exactly,
except
i
think
of
a
kind
where
children
get
only
have
some
wheels,
some
pedals,
they
push
and
the
puddle
in
the
rear
of
the
boat
makes
it
go.
now,
i
think
that's
what
it
is
and
i'm
not
sure
they
have
yatch
whatever
that
is.
now,
this
is
a
very
minor
part
of
the
activities
as
i
understand
the
record.
it
suggested
that
these
where
perhaps
purchased
out
of
state.
judge
mahaphy
in
his
opinion
said
that
it
was
common
knowledge,
boats
was
made
in
arkansas.
there
was
a
reference
to
an
oklahoma
boat
company
to
whom
the
paul's
paid
a
royalty.
but
it
is
not
clear
whether
if
one
ends
in
--
at
one
point,
the
question
is
from
whom
did
you
purchase
the
boats
or
did
you
purchase
a
yatch?
they
say
the
same
company,
meaning
the
same
company
to
whom
the
pay
the
royalties.
but
there's
not
testimony
about
rather
boats
was
made,
where
the
sale
was
made,
where
the
boat
came
from,
did
it
come
from
oklahoma
and
arkansas,
there's
nothing
about
it.
now,
assume
that
the
briefs
that
this
indicate
some
interstate
contact
with
reference
to
that
and
for
that
reason,
we
ought
to
say
that
the
entertainment
here,
these
boats,
move
in
commerce,
and
that
therefore,
this
activity
ought
to
be
a
covered
under
subsubsection
4
of
the
act
of
two
or
one
of
the
act.
we
suggest
that
it's
not
anywhere
near
like
the
miller
case
that
judge
mahaphy
in
his
opinion
was
correct
that
the
evidence
concerning
movement
with
reference
to
amusement
and
entertainment
movement
in
interstate
commerce
is
not
there.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
have
authority
and
has
not
have
a
possibility
of
drilling
on
the
applicability
of
the
title
42
section
1981
and
1982.
mr.
james
w.
gallman
a
--
again,
mr.
paul
was
asked
where
was
the
jukebox
made
and
he
said,
“i
don't
know.”
i
think
the
testimony
into
that.
mr.
james
w.
gallman
in
my
common
knowledge,
i
know
that
everyone
of
them
perhaps
came
through
interstate
commerce
and
i
know
the
jukeboxes
made
elsewhere.
i
don't
have
any
doubt
about
it.
i
think
that's
true.
i
think
--
mr.
james
w.
gallman
the
jukebox
to
play
and
listen
to
i
suppose.
mr.
james
w.
gallman
yes,
sir.
on
a
friday
night
perhaps
a
saturday
night
between
the
last
day
of
may
and
perhaps
labor
day
or
one
of
those
two
nights,
the
establishment
would
have
a
dance.
the
testimony
is
that
a
local
band
would
play
for
that
dance
and
we
would
not
have
entertainers
who
has
move
from
another
state
to
arkansas
to
present
the
performers.
these
were
so-called
amateurs
or
local
musicians.
of
course,
if
you
want
to
know
what
i
know
about,
that
would
say
that
the
jukebox
played
in
intermission
when
the
band
quit.
but
that's
not
in
the
record.
mr.
james
w.
gallman
i
believe
they
have
a
pavilion
your
honor
that
--
i
would
judge
what
it
would
put
in,
something
of
that
sort.
mr.
james
w.
gallman
no.
i
didn't
mean
to
say
that.
there
is
a
dressing
room
next
to
it
there's
a
lunch
counter.
as
i
recall
when
the
paul's
came
in,
they
put
some
more
drafts
down
the
edge
of
this
little
lake
in
the
shallow
water,
and
down
there,
erected
a
floor,
an
outdoor
type
cover
where
this
dancing
took
place.
mr.
james
w.
gallman
well
--
mr.
james
w.
gallman
--
i
think
the
people
danced.
i
think
the
record
shows
that
two
nights
a
week
events.
i
think
the
contention
was
that
it
wasn't
for
watching
others
dance,
it
was
for
people
to
dance
now.
i
would
--
mr.
james
w.
gallman
yes.
mr.
james
w.
gallman
the
district
court
did
and
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
said
perhaps
this
but
still
we
don't
have
any
interstate
connection
as
where
you
know
--
mr.
james
w.
gallman
what
is
mine?
i
have
to
agree
with
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
evidence
--
mr.
james
w.
gallman
well,
i
think
we
can
assemble
some
place
of
entertainment
and
then,
look
for
the
necessary
connection
as
acquired
by
201
(b)
(4)
or
(3),
excuse
me.
now,
it's
--
mr.
james
w.
gallman
--
well,
i
might
refer
to
this,
the
reference
to
excise
taxes
for
example
where
the
cabaret
tax
applied
to
a
20%
tax,
we
used
to
have.
mr.
james
w.
gallman
they
referred
to
the
names
of
the
band
your
honor
as
the
jinx,
pacers,
names
of
this
sort.
i
took
it
from
those
names
that
it
would
be
rock
and
roll
music.
mr.
james
w.
gallman
no,
sir.
to
return
to
the
question
of
mr.
justice
white,
the
cabaret
tax
was
applied
and
it
speaks
of
entertainment
was
applied
to
places
where
a
jukebox
furnished
the
music
for
dancing.
and
there
was
no
performance
as
such
and
those
cases
do
exist
that
i
know
of.
as
i've
said,
the
question
of
the
application
of
the
1981
was
not
before
the
court
of
appeals.
it
appears
in
the
language
brought
enough
to
prohibit
all
discriminatory
contract,
all
discriminatory
action
concerning
contracts.
the
government
i
think
raises
some
very
searching
questions
in
its
brief
concerning
the
impediments
that
might
exist
to
holding
that
1981
or
section
1
of
the
1866
act,
might
it
itself
be
sufficient
here.
i
noticed
that
they
caution
the
court
that
perhaps
this
should
be
characterized
here
as
a
sort
of
public
contract
and
that
the
1866
act
if
it
has
liability
ought
to
be
looked
at
as
referring
to
so-called
public
title
contract.
mr.
james
w.
gallman
sir.
mr.
james
w.
gallman
oh,
yes
your
honor.
i
knew
that
the
court
understand
to
say
there
were
not
jukeboxes
there.
mr.
james
w.
gallman
oh,
yes.
i
believe
it,
it
could
be
it.
mr.
james
w.
gallman
this
without
the
country
you
wouldn't
need
a
permit
for
the
dancing.
mr.
james
w.
gallman
no,
your
honor.
i
didn't
mean
to
--
mr.
james
w.
gallman
and
i
know
they
had
no
permit.
they
got
no
license.
i
think
they
did
have
a
periodic
inspection
by
the
health
department
that
i
point
yesterday
this
post
the
problem
because
sometimes,
their
water
didn't
--
water
supply
wasn't
sufficient
to
keep
the
pool
there
clean,
it
couldn't
be
chlorinated.
so,
there
is
one
point
i
must
raise
and
i
may
have
been
missed
in
this
your
honors.
the
--
i
had
assumed
when
i
was
invited
to
appear
here
that
it
was
perfectly
evident
that
the
reason
because
where
not
in
the
case
was
that
they
have
disposed
of
this
property.
i
found
that
though
arriving
here
and
checking
the
opposing
counsel
that
they
were
under
the
apprehension
that
the
paul's
in
fact
still
own
the
property
but
it
is
my
information
that
they
do
not.
that
they
dispose
of
it
september
26,
1968
through
a
sale,
that
they
reserve
2.75
acres
namely
the
tree
home
sites
own
this
property
for
themselves
but
otherwise
disposed
of
the
property.
now,
i
give
that
to
you
because
i
think
you
ought
to
know.
mr.
james
w.
gallman
well,
it
suggests
from
either
we
might
have
some
effect
on
that
area.
i
do
not
know
what
the
plans
or
the
new
orders
are,
if
they
intend
operate
it
perfectly.
i
can
see
utility
in
there
in
the
city.
mr.
james
w.
gallman
yes,
it's
a
group
of
10
individuals.
they
--
i'm
told
that
they
have
a
connection
with
a
church.
i
believe
they
form
a
private
corporation
to
acquire
this.
they
call
it
the
lake
nixon
incorporated
and
that's
as
much
as
i
know.
mr.
james
w.
gallman
yes.
mr.
james
w.
gallman
thank
you
your
honor,
it's
a
pleasure
to
be
--
