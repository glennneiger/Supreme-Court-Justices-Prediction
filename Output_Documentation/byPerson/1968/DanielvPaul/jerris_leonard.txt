mr.
jerris
leonard
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
suppose
that
the
first
question
that
would
come
to
anyone's
mind
in
our
appearance
here
is
why
the
central
government
should
be
interested
in
the
case
which
might
appeared
be
of
relatively
minor
importance.
may
well
be
that
on
the
facts
as
such
it
is
that
there
are
three
very
important
reasons
why
the
federal
government
is
concerned
about
not
only
the
issues
in
this
case
but
the
case
itself.
first
of
all,
little
rock,
arkansas
has
an
air
force
base
located
there
in
which
there
are
some
15,000
military
civilian
personnel
and
the
dependence
of
those
people.
in
a
county,
the
size
of
pulaski
county
which
is
roughly
285,000
according
to
the
census
figures,
this
is
a
rather
substantial
population
and
it
gives
to
the
federal
government
or
rather
substantial
interest
in
seeing
to
it
that
the
people
at
work
for
the
federal
government
are
in
fact
recorded
all
of
their
due
according
to
federal
law
if
in
fact
federal
law
applied.
so,
we
have
that
kind
of
an
interest
in
our
employees.
secondly,
title
ii
specifically
section
204
of
the
act
of
'64
gives
some
unusual
obligations
to
the
attorney
general
with
respect
to
the
question
of
public
accommodations.
and
we
are
therefore
interested
in
the
case
because
of
that
admonition
in
title
ii.
and
thirdly,
we
are
concerned
and
interested
because
we
believe
that
the
principal
in
this
case
is
one
on
which
we
would
like
to
have
some
settlement,
some
opinion,
a
decision
by
this
court
so
that
we
will
get
some
guide
to
future
action
in
this
kind
of
case.
we
feel
very
strongly
that
our
nation
has
made
and
is
making
great
progress
and
the
area
of
bringing
equal
voting,
equal
employment,
equal
housing,
and
other
equal
opportunities
to
our
negro
citizens.
negroes
in
greater
numbers
than
ever
before,
all
be
it.
there
are
still
too
few
in
number
are
beginning
to
share
the
fruits
of
our
free
economy.
but
first
class
citizenship
doesn't
mean
just
a
good
job
or
the
right
to
votes
or
sending
your
youngster
to
a
desegregated
school.
we
think
that
first
class
citizenship
means
much
more
than
that.
it
means
the
sharing
of
in
all
the
fruits
of
our
free
society.
it
means
taking
mama
out
to
dinner
on
sunday
and
be
able
to
seat
in
any
place
in
the
restaurant,
or
go
to
any
restaurant,
or
taking
the
kids
for
a
swim
on
a
hot
sunday,
or
taking
your
daughter
out
to
begin
the
teacher
the
basics
of
golf
at
the
lake
nixon
miniature
golf
course.
so,
from
the
philosophical
point
of
view,
we
have
a
very
deep
interest
in
what
the
court
decides
in
this
particular
case.
let
me
just
briefly
analyze
what
our
feeling
is
with
respect
to
the
opinions
below.
the
district
court
we
feel
got
hang
up
so
to
speak
on
the
issue
of
a
single
enterprise.
the
fact
that
these
were
not
the
enterprises
at
the
lake
nixon
were
not
separate
units
that
the
snack
bar
was
not
owned
by
someone
else,
the
swimming
facilities
and
so
on.
we
would
submit
to
the
court
that
that's
immaterial
to
the
customer.
he
doesn't
care
whether
one
person
owns
all
the
facilities
or
whether
a
group
of
people
own
each
one
of
the
separate
and
individual
facilities.
and
that
further
that
that
concept,
it
finds
no
rational
basis
in
section
201
of
the
act.
there's
nothing
in
there
that
indicates
that
congress
said
that
intent,
and
if
did,
it
could
have
put
some
verbiage
in
it
which
would
a
very
easily
delineated
that
intention
such
as
principally
engaged
in
this
or
under
separate
ownership
or
some
verbiage
that
would
have
given
a
clue
that
one
could
come
to
the
kind
of
conclusion
that
the
district
court
came
to.
and
thus,
we
feel
the
district
court
was
an
error
in
a
way
it
apply
the
law
to
these
particular
facts.
the
circuit
court
of
appeals,
it
used
the
hook
that
there
was
no
effect
on
interstate
commerce.
well,
i
would
submit
to
the
court
that
this
runs
contrary
to
common
knowledge
and
common
understanding.
little
rock,
arkansas
is
not
a
sleepy
little
hamlet
back
out
in
the
woods
some
place.
it
has
a
major
military
installation
in,
it
is
the
hub
of
a
great
state,
it
is
on
traffic
routes,
both
north
and
south
and
east
and
west,
so
it
isn't
very
back
in
the
woods.
and
the
issue
whether
is
whether
or
not
there
was
an
offer
to
serve,
any
of
these
facilities
assuming
that
they
are
covered
under
the
provisions
of
section
201
(b),
but
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
took
to
view
that
it
wasn't
like
consider
that
question
because
it
did
not
feel
there
was
any
effect
on
commerce
and
that
it
labored
over
the
issue
of
what
percentage
of
the
ingredients
in
the
food
or
the
soda
water,
whatever
else
might
come
on
--
might
have
come
to
lake
nixon
under
pursuant
to
interstate
commerce.
we
would
ask
the
court
to
reject
that
idea.
there's
ample
evidence.
this
court
can
used
its
knowledge,
its
common
sense,
things
that
are
of
common
knowledge
to
come
to
a
very
ready
conclusion
that
advertising
three
nights
a
week
on
the
radio
station
in
little
rock,
arkansas
with
15,000
people
just
that
the
military
installation
alone
plus
the
travels
that
there
were
bound
to
be
people
who
were
attracted
by
the
ad.
common
knowledge
also
would
tell
you
that
a
family
staying
in
a
motel
might
well
ask
the
motel
proprietor
whether
or
not
his
motel
has
any
arrangement
with
lake
nixon
to
use
its
facilities
and
certainly
it
became
knowledge,
common
knowledge
are
on
the
air
force
base
that
trans
inter,
if
you
are
white,
you
could
use
the
facilities
at
lake
nixon,
but
if
you
were
black,
you
couldn't.
and
i
submit
to
this
court
that
now,
common
knowledge
tells
us
that
there
were
--
that
most
of
the
people
who
were
at
little
rock
air
force
base
were
transits,
not
in
the
sense
that
they
were
there
for
a
few
days,
but
in
the
sense
that
they
were
residence
of
another
state.
and
they
are
just
as
much
in
interstate
commerce
as
are
the
people
who
are
driving
through
--
the
truck
driver,
the
family
on
vacation;
the
salesman
would
have
not,
and
they
are
entitled
just
as
much
for
the
protection
of
the
law
and
the
constitution.
now,
then,
let's
get
to
the
more
difficult
issue,
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
we
can
in
fact
find
coverage
in
section
(b)
in
either
three
under
the
entertainment
and
exhibition
provision,
or
under
four
as
what
i
term
a
combine
enterprise.
i
believe
this
court
can
find
justification
in
this
case
under
both
these
theories,
and
i
would
urge
the
court
to
consider
the
possibility
of
finding
its
decision
on
both
of
these
theories
because
both
will
then
become
useful.
look
at
the
decisions
in
the
evans
case
which
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
below
used
to
rule
against
the
plaintiffs.
i
would
point
out
to
you
that
the
evans
case,
that
fazzio,
that
the
miller
case
are
amusement
cases
and
what
they
in
effect
say
is
that
congress
wanted
--
enacted
this
section
and
use
that
particular
as
specific
verbiage
in
201
(b)
(3),
or
other
place
of
exhibition
or
entertainment
meant
that
a
roller-skating
ring
was
a
place
of
entertainment,
that
a
bowling
alley
was
a
place
of
entertainment,
that
a
golf
course
was
a
place
of
entertainment,
and
when
one
looks
at
the
evans
decision
particularly,
the
district
court
said,
i
find
that
because
that
this
is
a
place
of
entertainment
and
that
because
a
team
comes
once
a
year
from
washington
d.c.
to
virginia
to
play
golf,
that
that
brought
it
within
the
per
view
of
the
act.
what
i
say
that
the
district
court
was
really
saying
and
really
doing
was
saying
that
a
golf
course
is
a
place
of
entertainment
because
it
seems
to
me
not
logical
to
assume
that
there's
going
to
be
very
many
people
who
come
to
watch
an
amateur
golf
team
play
the
--
its
counterpart
from
the
rural
golf
club.
that's
not
going
to
attract
any
droves
unto
any
of
the
fairways
except
maybe
some
of
their
friends
who
may
be
waiting
at
the
18th
hole.
so
i
say
that
that's
not
an
exhibition
in
the
term
that
we
ordinarily
think
of
a
football
game,
a
basket
game
and
the
like.
and
that
section
201
(b)
(3)
specifically
assumed
and
those
cases
clearly
indicate
this
kind
of
entertainment,
entertainment
one
gets
out
or
participate
as
suppose
to
exhibit.
i
will
urge
the
court
to
consider
also
finding
that
the
provisions
o
201
(b)
(4),
the
combined
establishment
theory
clearly
apply
here.
the
congress
could
have
used
different
verbiage
if
it
didn't
mean
that
you
have
one
of
the
facilities
that
are
covered
under
two
in
four,
the
whole
thing
is
covered,
and
that
make
sense.
i
think
that's
reasonable
to
believe
that
congress
wanted
to
do
that,
at
least
say
a
whole
line
of
cases
whether
it
be
department
stores
or
bowling
alleys
or
what
it
is.
so
on
that
theory
also,
we
believe
that
there
is
coverage.
mr.
harper
went
into
the
issue
of
the
coverage
under
the
1866
act,
we
should
--
would
simply
urge
the
court
to
consider
that
as
--
mr.
jerris
leonard
well,
i
don't
see
your
honor
how
you
make
a
contract
with
the
vending
machine,
the
way
you
do
with
a
--
the
way
you
do
with
somebody
selling
hotdogs
or
--
mr.
jerris
leonard
well,
i
suppose
they
have
a
right
to
sue.
mr.
jerris
leonard
i
think
it's
an
either
or
a
situation
--
mr.
jerris
leonard
it's
irrelevant
where
(voice
overlap)
to
serve.
mr.
jerris
leonard
yes,
i
would
because
you
either
have
to
sell
merchandise
which
move
in
interstate
commerce
so
you
have
to
serve
people.
mr.
jerris
leonard
the
overall
gross
was
23%,
but
the
district
court
did
not
attempt
to
find
nor
was
there
evidence
offered
at
district
court
at
level
with
respect
to
what
percentage
of
that
actually
move
in
interstate
commerce.
mr.
jerris
leonard
if
your
honor
please,
i'd
like
to
point
out
two
important
statements
that
the
trial
court
judge
said
that
this
was
a
necessary
adjunct
to
this
business.
mr.
paul
himself
testified
at
page
85
of
the
appendix
--
no,
i'm
sorry,
it's
in
the
district
court
record.
he
said
that
this
--
that
the
lunch
counter
was
a
necessity.
now,
what
--
there
was
--
mr.
jerris
leonard
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
answer
that
question
because
they
simply
said
there
was,
it
had
no
affect
on
commerce,
it
did
not
offer
a
serve
interstate
travelers,
and
therefore,
it
wasn't
necessary
to
decide
whether
--
mr.
jerris
leonard
district
court
said
that
it
was
not
a
covered
establishment
under
either
category
three
or
four,
or
category
two.
the
lunch
counter
itself
was
not
covered,
so
it
never
got
to
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
there
was
an
effect
in
interstate
commerce,
but
it
said,
the
district
court
said
let
us
recall
that
--
that
it
is
of
--
at
page
57
of
course,
it
is
probably
true
that
some
out
of
state
people
spending
time
in
and
around
little
rock
have
utilized
one
or
both
facilities.
i
think
that
combined
with
the
air
force
base,
combined
for
that
the
nature
of
little
rock,
the
nature
of
the
advertising,
and
by
the
way,
i'd
like
to
just
close
on
that
point.
the
court
if
anything
should
use
the
air
that
seems
to
me
against
the
defendant
because
of
the
fact
that
they
had
the
audacity
to
advertise
this
member
situation
knowing
full
well
it
was
a
sham.
it
was
arouse
and
a
sham
and
they
admitted
under
oath
that
it
was
arouse
and
a
sham.
they
didn't
put
it
into
effect
until
after
the
time
the
'64
act
came
into
be.
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
jerris
leonard
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
suppose
that
the
first
question
that
would

may

be
that
on

it
is
that
there
are
three
very
important
reasons
why
the
federal

is
concerned
about
not

the

in

the
case
itself.

separate
and
individual
facilities.
and
that
further
that
that
concept,
it
finds
no
rational
basis
in
section
201
of
the
act.
there's
nothing
in
there
that
indicates
that
congress
said
that
intent,
and
if
did,
it
could
have
put
some
verbiage
in
it
which
would
a
very
easily
delineated
that
intention
such
as
principally
engaged
in
this
or
under
separate
ownership
or
some
verbiage
that
would
have
given
a
clue
that
one
could
come
to
the
kind
of
conclusion
that
the
district
court
came
to.
and
thus,
we
feel
the
district
court
was
an
error
in
a
way
it
apply
the
law
to
these
particular
facts.
the
circuit
court
of
appeals,
it
used
the
hook
that
there
was
no
effect
on
interstate
commerce.
well,
i
would
submit
to
the
court
that
this
runs
contrary
to
common
knowledge
and
common
understanding.
little
rock,
arkansas
is
not
a
sleepy
little
hamlet
back
out
in
the
woods
some
place.
it
has
a
major
military
installation
in,
it
is
the
hub
of
a
great
state,
it
is
on
traffic
routes,
both
north
and
south
and
east
and
west,
so
it
isn't
very
back
in
the
woods.
and
the
issue
whether
is
whether
or
not
there
was
an
offer
to
serve,
any
of
these
facilities
assuming
that
they
are
covered
under
the
provisions
of
section
201
(b),
but
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
took
to
view
that
it
wasn't
like
consider
that
question
because
it
did
not
feel
there
was
any
effect
on
commerce
and
that
it
labored
over
the
issue
of
what
percentage
of
the
ingredients
in
the
food
or
the
soda
water,
whatever
else
might
come
on
--
might
have
come
to
lake
nixon
under
pursuant
to
interstate
commerce.
we
would
ask
the
court
to
reject
that
idea.
there's
ample
evidence.
this
court
can
used
its
knowledge,
its
common
sense,
things
that
are
of
common
knowledge
to
come
to
a
very
ready
conclusion
that
advertising
three
nights
a
week
on
the
radio
station
in
little
rock,
arkansas
with
15,000
people
just
that
the
military
installation
alone
plus
the
travels
that
there
were
bound
to
be
people
who
were
attracted
by
the
ad.
common
knowledge
also
would
tell
you
that
a
family
staying
in
a
motel
might
well
ask
the
motel
proprietor
whether
or
not
his
motel
has
any
arrangement
with
lake
nixon
to
use
its
facilities
and
certainly
it
became
knowledge,
common
knowledge
are
on
the
air
force
base
that
trans
inter,
if
you
are
white,
you
could
use
the
facilities
at
lake
nixon,
but
if
you
were
black,
you
couldn't.
and
i
submit
to
this
court
that
now,
common
knowledge
tells
us
that
there
were
--
that
most
of
the
people
who
were
at
little
rock
air
force
base
were
transits,
not
in
the
sense
that
they
were
there
for
a
few
days,
but
in
the
sense
that
they
were
residence
of
another
state.
and
they
are
just
as
much
in
interstate
commerce
as
are
the
people
who
are
driving
through
--
the
truck
driver,
the
family
on
vacation;
the
salesman
would
have
not,
and
they
are
entitled
just
as
much
for
the
protection
of
the
law
and
the
constitution.
now,
then,
let's
get
to
the
more
difficult
issue,
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
we
can
in
fact
find
coverage
in
section
(b)
in
either
three
under
the
entertainment
and
exhibition
provision,
or
under
four
as
what
i
term
a
combine
enterprise.
i
believe
this
court
can
find
justification
in
this
case
under
both
these
theories,
and
i
would
urge
the
court
to
consider
the
possibility
of
finding
its
decision
on
both
of
these
theories
because
both
will
then
become
useful.
look
at
the
decisions
in
the
evans
case
which
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
below
used
to
rule
against
the
plaintiffs.
i
would
point
out
to
you
that
the
evans
case,
that
fazzio,
that
the
miller
case
are
amusement
cases
and
what
they
in
effect
say
is
that
congress
wanted
--
enacted
this
section
and
use
that
particular
as
specific
verbiage
in
201
(b)
(3),
or
other
place
of
exhibition
or
entertainment
meant
that
a
roller-skating
ring
was
a
place
of
entertainment,
that
a
bowling
alley
was
a
place
of
entertainment,
that
a
golf
course
was
a
place
of
entertainment,
and
when
one
looks
at
the
evans
decision
particularly,
the
district
court
said,
i
find
that
because
that
this
is
a
place
of
entertainment
and
that
because
a
team
comes
once
a
year
from
washington
d.c.
to
virginia
to
play
golf,
that
that
brought
it
within
the
per
view
of
the
act.
what
i
say
that
the
district
court
was
really
saying
and
really
doing
was
saying
that
a
golf
course
is
a
place
of
entertainment
because
it
seems
to
me
not
logical
to
assume
that
there's
going
to
be
very
many
people
who
come
to
watch
an
amateur
golf
team
play
the
--
its
counterpart
from
the
rural
golf
club.
that's
not
going
to
attract
any
droves
unto
any
of
the
fairways
except
maybe
some
of
their
friends
who
may
be
waiting
at
the
18th
hole.
so
i
say
that
that's
not
an
exhibition
in
the
term
that
we
ordinarily
think
of
a
football
game,
a
basket
game
and
the
like.
and
that
section
201
(b)
(3)
specifically
assumed
and
those
cases
clearly
indicate
this
kind
of
entertainment,
entertainment
one
gets
out
or
participate
as
suppose
to
exhibit.
i
will
urge
the
court
to
consider
also
finding
that
the
provisions
o
201
(b)
(4),
the
combined
establishment
theory
clearly
apply
here.
the
congress
could
have
used
different
verbiage
if
it
didn't
mean
that
you
have
one
of
the
facilities
that
are
covered
under
two
in
four,
the
whole
thing
is
covered,
and
that
make
sense.
i
think
that's
reasonable
to
believe
that
congress
wanted
to
do
that,
at
least
say
a
whole
line
of
cases
whether
it
be
department
stores
or
bowling
alleys
or
what
it
is.
so
on
that
theory
also,
we
believe
that
there
is
coverage.
mr.
harper
went
into
the
issue
of
the
coverage
under
the
1866
act,
we
should
--
would
simply
urge
the
court
to
consider
that
as
--
mr.
jerris
leonard
well,
i
don't
see
your
honor
how
you
make
a
contract
with
the
vending
machine,
the
way
you
do
with
a
--
the
way
you
do
with
somebody
selling
hotdogs
or
--
mr.
jerris
leonard
well,
i
suppose
they
have
a
right
to
sue.
mr.
jerris
leonard
i
think
it's
an
either
or
a
situation
--
mr.
jerris
leonard
it's
irrelevant
where
(voice
overlap)
to
serve.
mr.
jerris
leonard
yes,
i
would
because
you
either
have
to
sell
merchandise
which
move
in
interstate
commerce
so
you
have
to
serve
people.
mr.
jerris
leonard
the
overall
gross
was
23%,
but
the
district
court
did
not
attempt
to
find
nor
was
there
evidence
offered
at
district
court
at
level
with
respect
to
what
percentage
of
that
actually
move
in
interstate
commerce.
mr.
jerris
leonard
if
your
honor
please,
i'd
like
to
point
out
two
important
statements
that
the
trial
court
judge
said
that
this
was
a
necessary
adjunct
to
this
business.
mr.
paul
himself
testified
at
page
85
of
the
appendix
--
no,
i'm
sorry,
it's
in
the
district
court
record.
he
said
that
this
--
that
the
lunch
counter
was
a
necessity.
now,
what
--
there
was
--
mr.
jerris
leonard
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
answer
that
question
because
they
simply
said
there
was,
it
had
no
affect
on
commerce,
it
did
not
offer
a
serve
interstate
travelers,
and
therefore,
it
wasn't
necessary
to
decide
whether
--
mr.
jerris
leonard
district
court
said
that
it
was
not
a
covered
establishment
under
either
category
three
or
four,
or
category
two.
the
lunch
counter
itself
was
not
covered,
so
it
never
got
to
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
there
was
an
effect
in
interstate
commerce,
but
it
said,
the
district
court
said
let
us
recall
that
--
that
it
is
of
--
at
page
57
of
course,
it
is
probably
true
that
some
out
of
state
people
spending
time
in
and
around
little
rock
have
utilized
one
or
both
facilities.
i
think
that
combined
with
the
air
force
base,
combined
for
that
the
nature
of
little
rock,
the
nature
of
the
advertising,
and
by
the
way,
i'd
like
to
just
close
on
that
point.
the
court
if
anything
should
use
the
air
that
seems
to
me
against
the
defendant
because
of
the
fact
that
they
had
the
audacity
to
advertise
this
member
situation
knowing
full
well
it
was
a
sham.
it
was
arouse
and
a
sham
and
they
admitted
under
oath
that
it
was
arouse
and
a
sham.
they
didn't
put
it
into
effect
until
after
the
time
the
'64
act
came
into
be.
thank
you
your
honor.
