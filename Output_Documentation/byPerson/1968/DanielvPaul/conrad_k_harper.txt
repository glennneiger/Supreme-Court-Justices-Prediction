mr.
conrad
k.
harper
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
concerns
two
black
ladies
who
were
refuse
service
at
the
recreational
facility
called
lake
nixon
club
located
just
outside
the
little
rock,
arkansas.
the
respondents
are
the
owners
of
lake
nixon
club,
mr.
and
mrs.
paul.
following
the
refusal
of
that
facility
to
serve,
the
petitioners,
black
ladies,
they
brought
class
action
in
a
district
court
sitting
in
little
rock
for
injunction
--
injunctive
relief.
the
district
court
following
that
trial
held
that
lake
nixon
was
not
a
facility
subject
to
title
ii
of
the
1964
civil
rights
act.
specifically
holding
that
the
food
facilities
at
lake
nixon
were
no
embraced
within
the
statute
and
also
that
lake
nixon
was
not
a
place
of
entertainment
or
exhibition
within
the
ambit
of
the
statute.
the
district
court
hold
also
summarily
rejected
the
claim
made
by
respondents
below
that
lake
nixon
club
was
a
bonafide
private
club.
on
appeal,
the
eighth
circuit
affirmed
on
all
grounds
with
one
judge
dissenting.
this
court
grant
a
certiorari
not
only
to
determine
questions
relating
to
cover
john
to
title
ii
of
the
1964
act,
but
additionally,
on
the
question
whether
the
1866
civil
rights
act
now
portionally
cutified
as
42
u.s.c.
sections
1981
and
1982
acted
to
bar
discrimination
in
this
facility.
the
petitioners
make
two
--
i
should
say
three
principal
arguments.
first,
that
lake
nixon
food
facilities
where
such
as
to
bring
the
whole
of
lake
nixon
within
the
ambit
of
title
ii,
second,
that
lake
nixon
in
its
entire
tables
of
place
of
entertainment
or
exhibition
within
the
terms
of
title
ii,
and
thirdly,
that
1981
and
1982
insofar
as
a
granted
an
equal
right
to
contract
and
have
an
interest
in
property,
granted
petitioners
the
right
to
have
access
to
lake
nixon.
the
facts
in
this
case
are
relatively
simple
and
not
in
dispute.
lake
nixon
is
a
232-acre
site
located
not
far
from
the
lit
rock,
arkansas
which
has
facilities
for
boating
and
swimming
and
picnicking
and
miniature
golf.
it
also
has
a
snack
bar
which
serves
sandwiches
and
softdrinks
and
milk,
and
it
also
has
in
that
snack
bar
a
jukebox.
lake
nixon
also
advertises
its
facility.
specifically,
the
record
shows
that
during
its
normal
season
which
runs
from
may
until
september
of
every
year,
lake
nixon
ran
in
1966,
three
advertisements
every
week
on
a
radio
station
little
rock
as
well
as
utilized
the
facilities
of
another
little
rock
radio
station
for
similar
kind
of
announcement.
those
announcements
incidentally,
the
record
reflects
were
addressed
to
all
members
of
lake
nixon,
and
one
could
purchase
on
membership
so-called
in
this
facilities
simply
by
paying
a
quarter
for
each
season.
lake
nixon
also
advertise
--
mr.
conrad
k.
harper
quarter
for
the
entire
season
your
honor;
in
other
words,
for
may
until
september.
and
after
obtaining
this
admission
card,
one
then
had
to
pay
an
additional
money
if
he
wanted
to
buy
something
at
snack
bar,
but
he
might
not
pay
anything
if
you
want
simply
to
get
picnicking
or
swimming.
lake
nixon
also
advertise
its
facilities
in
a
magazine
distributed
locally
showing
facilities
open
called
little
rock
today,
that
was
done
once
the
record
shows
in
1966,
and
also
once
in
1966
lake
nixon
distributed
an
advertisement
in
a
publication
which
was
distributed
at
the
air
force
base
located
in
jacksonville,
arkansas.
mr.
conrad
k.
harper
no
your
honor.
what
is
on
file
for
the
court
but
not
printed
is
a
copy
of
a
radio
copy
used
in
the
radio
announcements.
the
announcements
with
reference
to
the
magazines
are
not
printed
in
the
appendix
or
not
a
part
of
the
record
in
this
case,
simply
testimony
that
such
will
run.
mr.
conrad
k.
harper
there's
not
specific
testimony
on
that,
what
there
is
it's
a
general
statement
by
mr.
paul
as
i
recall
which
says
that
all
advertisements
are
addressed
to
all
members
of
lake
nixon.
now,
title
ii
has
a
comprehensive
scheme
for
coverage
of
public
accommodations
as
defined,
specifically
with
regard
to
the
food
facilities.
it
says
that
a
food
facility
maybe
covered
if
it
serves
or
offers
to
serve
in
a
state
travelers
or
a
substantial
portion
of
the
food
which
it
serves
move
in
commerce.
the
evidence
shows
here
as
we've
just
been
talking
that
lake
nixon
during
1966
advertised
its
facilities
and
the
evidence
fairly
show
--
also
shows
that
lake
nixon
was
opened
to
the
general
white
public.
having
advertised
its
facilities
to
the
public
and
general,
it
seems
clear
to
us
that
lake
nixon
was
in
fact
offering
it
services
to
members
of
the
interstate
public,
and
therefore
for
purposes
of
title
ii,
lake
nixon's
food
facilities
were
opened
to
persons
in
the
general
public.
that
being
so
that
statute
then
provides
that
all
other
facilities
which
are
opened
to
the
people
patronizing
the
food
facility
are
opened
pursuant
to
title
ii.
the
district
court
took
a
different
view
in
this
particular
question.
the
district
court
found
that
there
had
been
no
offer
to
serve
interstate
travelers
as
such.
we
believe
that's
a
misconstruction
of
the
statute.
congress
had
in
mind
simply
an
offer
to
serve
people
in
general
and
if
there
were
not
any
evidence
of
a
prohibition
on
interstate
travelers
or
in
this
case,
no
inquiry
even
as
to
where
people
came
from.
indeed,
mr.
paul
didn't
even
know
how
many
members
there
were,
although
he
estimated
about
a
100,000.
we
think
that
sufficient
to
bring
this
lunch
counter,
and
therefore
the
hold
of
lake
nixon
in
the
ambit
of
the
statute.
also
with
regard
to
food
facilities,
there
is
the
test
that
a
substantial
portion
of
the
food
moved
in
commerce.
the
evidence
on
this
issue
was
simply
that
lake
nixon
and
its
snack
bar
serve
hamburgers,
hotdogs,
softdrinks
and
milk.
the
district
court
made
a
specific
finding
that
the
ingredients
used
in
the
softdrinks
and
ingredients
used
in
the
bread
were
such
as
at
moved
in
interstate
commerce.
however,
he
deemed
that
insufficient
for
coverage
under
title
ii.
the
eighth
circuit
not
disturbing
that
finding
made
an
additional
finding
that
in
its
view,
the
milk
at
least
was
locally
produced.
we
submit
that
since
lake
nixon
sole
only
four
principal
items,
three
of
which,
that
is
the
hamburgers,
hotdogs
and
softdrinks
contained
out
of
state
ingredients.
this
was
sufficient
to
meet
any
kind
of
reasonable
substantiality
test,
and
therefore,
lake
nixon
as
a
whole
was
covered
by
title
ii.
the
district
court
took
the
view
that
that
was
not
the
case
and
the
eighth
circuit
similarly
took
a
view.
in
part,
said
that
district
court,
lake
nixon
was
a
whole
facility,
not
principally
engage
in
selling
food
for
consumption
on
the
premises.
we
of
course
disagree
with
that
on
the
grounds
that
lake
nixon's
snack
bar
at
least
principally
was
engaged
in
serving
food
for
consumption
on
that
premises,
and
therefore
the
hold
of
lake
nixon
was
covered.
an
additional
ground
of
title
ii
is
the
claim
that
lake
nixon
was
an
entertainment
or
--
a
facility
or
place
engaged
in
giving
exhibitions.
we
specifically
note
here
that
the
jukeboxes
were
found
by
the
district
court
to
have
been
acquired
for
outside
state
of
arkansas.
that
being
the
case,
it
seems
to
us
the
jukeboxes
nationally
source
of
entertainment
for
persons
who
may
listen
or
perhaps
dance
to
it,
and
therefore,
this
was
sufficient
for
purposes
of
coverage
to
say
that
lake
nixon
was
placed,
that
had
entertainment
or
exhibitions,
which
in
moved
in
commerce.
additionally
however,
the
evidence
shows
that
lake
nixon
had
so-called
surf
boards
or
yachts
which
were
purchased
from
an
oklahoma
company.
and
furthermore
that
from
the
same
oklahoma
company,
lake
nixon
had
least
certain
paddle
boats.
we
think
this
is
sufficient
again
to
show
that
lake
nixon's
sources
of
entertainment
had
affected
commerce,
and
therefore,
lake
nixon
as
a
whole
was
subject
to
the
ambit
or
title
ii.
and
what
we've
mentioned
here
as
another
and
further
ground
for
showing
that
lake
nixon
was
a
place
of
entertainment
or
exhibition,
that
local
people
might
well
come
there
to
be
entertained
either
by
their
family
or
by
their
friends
or
exhibiting
their
prows
in
any
given
area
of
lake
nixon's
facilities.
for
the
fifth
circuit
seating
on
bunk
in
the
miller
case,
this
kind
of
activity
was
sufficient
to
define
a
place
of
entertainment
and
we
submit
the
same
was
true
here.
mr.
conrad
k.
harper
that
--
mr.
conrad
k.
harper
that's
right.
dances
were
given
every
friday
or
saturday
at
lake
nixon.
the
evidence
however
does
show
further
that
the
musicians
who
played
live
at
those
dances
apparently
were
only
from
pulaski
county,
and
therefore,
were
not
in
commerce
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
mr.
conrad
k.
harper
oh,
yes.
we
certainly
ask
some
additional
source
for
showing
a
place
of
entertainment.
that
being
so
with
regard
to
title
ii,
we
turn
into
possible
coverage
under
the
1866
civil
rights
act.
1981
was
specifically
pleaded
in
this
case
in
the
complaint,
now
that
the
courts
below
passed
upon
it
because
this
court's
decision
in
jones
versus
meyer
company
did
was
not
handed
down
to
that
of
the
eighth
circuit
denied
rehearing
in
this
case.
we
think
it
manifest
that
this
was
an
ordinary
kind
of
contractual
arrangement,
one
paid
money
and
in
return
had
the
option
for
bailing
himself
of
services
located
at
lake
nixon,
and
the
evidence
is
uncontroverted
that
the
petitioners
in
this
case
were
denied
that
right,
that
contractual
right
if
you
will
on
the
grounds
have
raise.
we
think
nothing
could
be
clearer
as
violative
in
1981.
with
regards
to
1982
which
provides
for
equal
property
rights
and
no
denial
thereof
on
ground
of
raise,
we
think
could
clear
also
that
what
really
was
involved
here
was,
one,
have
the
opportunity
to
use
the
property
of
lake
nixon,
either
its
jukeboxes
or
its
miniature
golf
or
its
swimming
facilities,
and
therefore,
the
rational
of
the
jones
case
would
indicated
that
this
kind
of
property
should
not
be
denied
to
persons
on
grounds
or
breaks.
mr.
conrad
k.
harper
that's
right,
it
was
not
pleaded
below
and
none
of
the
courts
below
ruled
upon
the
issue.
however,
this
court
granted
certiorari
and
we
think
that
there's
ample
authority
for
this
court
to
dispose
of
the
case
on
that
ground
if
it
wishes.
mr.
conrad
k.
harper
under
title
ii
you
mean
or
under
1981?
mr.
conrad
k.
harper
oh
yes,
or
any
of
the
facilities,
but
that's
true.
mr.
conrad
k.
harper
that's
right,
that's
our
position.
mr.
conrad
k.
harper
which
open
to
the
general
public,
except
negroes,
that's
right.
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
shall
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
conrad
k.
harper
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
court.
with
reference
to
mr.
gallman's
last
point
concerning
the
disposition
of
the
lake
nixon
property.
rumor
came
to
our
attention
sometime
in
december
after
this
court
had
granted
certiorari
that
the
property
had
been
disposed
of.
where
upon
i
call
the
former
attorney
for
the
paul,
mr.
robinson,
i
believe
his
name
was.
he
indicated
he
was
not
then
their
attorney,
he's
understanding
was
that
they
did
not
wish
to
pursue
this
case.
however,
he
recommended
and
since
he
didn't
know
anything
more,
i
might
talk
with
mrs.
paul
and
mr.
paul.
so,
i
took
this
extraordinary
step
of
calling
mrs.
paul
directly
and
asked
her
whether
she
had
in
fact
disposed
of
the
property.
her
answer
was
“no”,
that
the
thought
it
was
under
contract
but
the
deal
had
not
been
consummated.
and
that
is
as
much
of
i
know
and
that
was
of
as
of
late
december,
1968.
with
reference
to
the
other
principal
question,
i'd
like
address
myself
to
now,
that
is
the
food
that
was
served
at
lake
nixon.
i
think
it's
efficient
for
this
court
if
it
wishes
to
--
mr.
conrad
k.
harper
i'm
sorry.
mr.
conrad
k.
harper
i
think
it
is
sufficient
for
this
court
if
it
wishes
to
undertake
to
look
at
this
case
the
way
it
look
to
the
case
as
hamm
versus
rock
hill.
there,
there
was
no
evidence
as
to
the
origin
of
the
food
involved
and
yet,
this
court
in
a
divided
opinion
or
a
divided
court
undertook
to
say
that
the
facilities
in
hamm
as
well
as
a
companion
case
where
in
fact
opened
to
the
public.
they
were
located
neither
or
five
and
dime
in
south
carolina
or
department
store
in
arkansas.
and
that
was
sufficient
that
court
felt
to
demonstrate
that
in
the
ordinary
course
interstate
connections
could
be
shown
as
to
the
origin
of
the
food.
we
think
that
situation
is
particularly
at
here
because
the
district
court
seating
at
little
rock
very
close
to
lake
nixon
undertook
to
say
that
as
far
as
he
was
concerned,
there
was
sufficient
--
a
connection
with
interstate
commerce
to
demonstrate
that
some
of
the
food
at
least
had
originated
outside
the
state.
therefore,
our
position
of
course
is
the
case
is
not
moot
and
the
complaint
i
might
mention
inclusion,
those
run
against
successors
in
addition
to
the
paul's,
who
believe
that
might
get
situation
here.
i
have
no
further
comments
unless
the
court
has
some
questions.
mr.
conrad
k.
harper
with
reference
to
the
food,
there
was
no
evidence,
what
the
court
found
was
that
some
of
the
ingredients
in
the
bread
had
originated
outside
of
the
state
as
far
as
he
was
concern,
and
that
ingredients
in
the
softdrinks
are
similarly
originated
outside
of
the
state.
but
there
was
no
testimony
with
reference
--
mr.
conrad
k.
harper
he
did
not
specify
which
ingredients.
although,
i
might
indicate
that
on
file
with
the
court
are
some
20
photographs
of
lake
nixon.
some
of
which
show
coca-cola
signs
and
it
may
have
been
had
that
in
mind
when
he
said
some
of
the
ingredients
of
softdrinks
originate
outside
of
arkansas.
thank
you.
mr.
conrad
k.
harper
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
concerns
two
black
ladies
who
were
refuse
service
at
the
recreational
facility
called
lake
nixon
club
located
just
outside
the
little
rock,
arkansas.
the
respondents
are
the
owners
of
lake
nixon
club,
mr.
and
mrs.
paul.
following
the
refusal
of
that
facility
to
serve,
the
petitioners,
black
ladies,
they
brought
class
action
in
a
district
court
sitting
in
little
rock
for
injunction
--
injunctive
relief.
the
district
court
following
that
trial
held
that
lake
nixon
was
not
a
facility
subject
to
title
ii
of
the
1964
civil
rights
act.
specifically
holding
that
the
food
facilities
at
lake
nixon
were
no
embraced
within
the
statute
and
also
that
lake
nixon
was
not
a
place
of
entertainment
or
exhibition
within
the
ambit
of
the
statute.
the
district
court
hold
also
summarily
rejected
the
claim
made
by
respondents
below
that
lake
nixon
club
was
a
bonafide
private
club.
on
appeal,
the
eighth
circuit
affirmed
on
all
grounds
with
one
judge
dissenting.
this
court
grant
a
certiorari
not
only
to
determine
questions
relating
to
cover
john
to
title
ii
of
the
1964
act,
but
additionally,
on
the
question
whether
the
1866
civil
rights
act
now
portionally
cutified
as
42
u.s.c.
sections
1981
and
1982
acted
to
bar
discrimination
in
this
facility.
the
petitioners
make
two
--
i
should
say
three
principal
arguments.
first,
that
lake
nixon
food
facilities
where
such
as
to
bring
the
whole
of
lake
nixon
within
the
ambit
of
title
ii,
second,
that
lake
nixon
in
its
entire
tables
of
place
of
entertainment
or
exhibition
within
the
terms
of
title
ii,
and
thirdly,
that
1981
and
1982
insofar
as
a
granted
an
equal
right
to
contract
and
have
an
interest
in
property,
granted
petitioners
the
right
to
have
access
to
lake
nixon.
the
facts
in
this
case
are
relatively
simple
and
not
in
dispute.
lake
nixon
is
a
232-acre
site
located
not
far
from
the
lit
rock,
arkansas
which
has
facilities
for
boating
and
swimming
and
picnicking
and
miniature
golf.
it
also
has
a
snack
bar
which
serves
sandwiches
and
softdrinks
and
milk,
and
it
also
has
in
that
snack
bar
a
jukebox.
lake
nixon
also
advertises
its
facility.
specifically,
the
record
shows
that
during
its
normal
season
which
runs
from
may
until
september
of
every
year,
lake
nixon
ran
in
1966,
three
advertisements
every
week
on
a
radio
station
little
rock
as
well
as
utilized
the
facilities
of
another
little
rock
radio
station
for
similar
kind
of
announcement.
those
announcements
incidentally,
the
record
reflects
were
addressed
to
all
members
of
lake
nixon,
and
one
could
purchase
on
membership
so-called
in
this
facilities
simply
by
paying
a
quarter
for
each
season.
lake
nixon
also
advertise
--
mr.
conrad
k.
harper
quarter
for
the
entire
season
your
honor;
in
other
words,
for
may
until
september.
and
after
obtaining
this
admission
card,
one
then
had
to
pay
an
additional
money
if
he
wanted
to
buy
something
at
snack
bar,
but
he
might
not
pay
anything
if
you
want
simply
to
get
picnicking
or
swimming.
lake
nixon
also
advertise
its
facilities
in
a
magazine
distributed
locally
showing
facilities
open
called
little
rock
today,
that
was
done
once
the
record
shows
in
1966,
and
also
once
in
1966
lake
nixon
distributed
an
advertisement
in
a
publication
which
was
distributed
at
the
air
force
base
located
in
jacksonville,
arkansas.
mr.
conrad
k.
harper
no
your
honor.
what
is
on
file
for
the
court
but
not
printed
is
a
copy
of
a
radio
copy
used
in
the
radio
announcements.
the
announcements
with
reference
to
the
magazines
are
not
printed
in
the
appendix
or
not
a
part
of
the
record
in
this
case,
simply
testimony
that
such
will
run.
mr.
conrad
k.
harper
there's
not
specific
testimony
on
that,
what
there
is
it's
a
general
statement
by
mr.
paul
as
i
recall
which
says
that
all
advertisements
are
addressed
to
all
members
of
lake
nixon.
now,
title
ii
has
a
comprehensive
scheme
for
coverage
of
public
accommodations
as
defined,
specifically
with
regard
to
the
food
facilities.
it
says
that
a
food
facility
maybe
covered
if
it
serves
or
offers
to
serve
in
a
state
travelers
or
a
substantial
portion
of
the
food
which
it
serves
move
in
commerce.
the
evidence
shows
here
as
we've
just
been
talking
that
lake
nixon
during
1966
advertised
its
facilities
and
the
evidence
fairly
show
--
also
shows
that
lake
nixon
was
opened
to
the
general
white
public.
having
advertised
its
facilities
to
the
public
and
general,
it
seems
clear
to
us
that
lake
nixon
was
in
fact
offering
it
services
to
members
of
the
interstate
public,
and
therefore
for
purposes
of
title
ii,
lake
nixon's
food
facilities
were
opened
to
persons
in
the
general
public.
that
being
so
that
statute
then
provides
that
all
other
facilities
which
are
opened
to
the
people
patronizing
the
food
facility
are
opened
pursuant
to
title
ii.
the
district
court
took
a
different
view
in
this
particular
question.
the
district
court
found
that
there
had
been
no
offer
to
serve
interstate
travelers
as
such.
we
believe
that's
a
misconstruction
of
the
statute.
congress
had
in
mind
simply
an
offer
to
serve
people
in
general
and
if
there
were
not
any
evidence
of
a
prohibition
on
interstate
travelers
or
in
this
case,
no
inquiry
even
as
to
where
people
came
from.
indeed,
mr.
paul
didn't
even
know
how
many
members
there
were,
although
he
estimated
about
a
100,000.
we
think
that
sufficient
to
bring
this
lunch
counter,
and
therefore
the
hold
of
lake
nixon
in
the
ambit
of
the
statute.
also
with
regard
to
food
facilities,
there
is
the
test
that
a
substantial
portion
of
the
food
moved
in
commerce.
the
evidence
on
this
issue
was
simply
that
lake
nixon
and
its
snack
bar
serve
hamburgers,
hotdogs,
softdrinks
and
milk.
the
district
court
made
a
specific
finding
that
the
ingredients
used
in
the
softdrinks
and
ingredients
used
in
the
bread
were
such
as
at
moved
in
interstate
commerce.
however,
he
deemed
that
insufficient
for
coverage
under
title
ii.
the
eighth
circuit
not
disturbing
that
finding
made
an
additional
finding
that
in
its
view,
the
milk
at
least
was
locally
produced.
we
submit
that
since
lake
nixon
sole
only
four
principal
items,
three
of
which,
that
is
the
hamburgers,
hotdogs
and
softdrinks
contained
out
of
state
ingredients.
this
was
sufficient
to
meet
any
kind
of
reasonable
substantiality
test,
and
therefore,
lake
nixon
as
a
whole
was
covered
by
title
ii.
the
district
court
took
the
view
that
that
was
not
the
case
and
the
eighth
circuit
similarly
took
a
view.
in
part,
said
that
district
court,
lake
nixon
was
a
whole
facility,
not
principally
engage
in
selling
food
for
consumption
on
the
premises.
we
of
course
disagree
with
that
on
the
grounds
that
lake
nixon's
snack
bar
at
least
principally
was
engaged
in
serving
food
for
consumption
on
that
premises,
and
therefore
the
hold
of
lake
nixon
was
covered.
an
additional
ground
of
title
ii
is
the
claim
that
lake
nixon
was
an
entertainment
or
--
a
facility
or
place
engaged
in
giving
exhibitions.
we
specifically
note
here
that
the
jukeboxes
were
found
by
the
district
court
to
have
been
acquired
for
outside
state
of
arkansas.
that
being
the
case,
it
seems
to
us
the
jukeboxes
nationally
source
of
entertainment
for
persons
who
may
listen
or
perhaps
dance
to
it,
and
therefore,
this
was
sufficient
for
purposes
of
coverage
to
say
that
lake
nixon
was
placed,
that
had
entertainment
or
exhibitions,
which
in
moved
in
commerce.
additionally
however,
the
evidence
shows
that
lake
nixon
had
so-called
surf
boards
or
yachts
which
were
purchased
from
an
oklahoma
company.
and
furthermore
that
from
the
same
oklahoma
company,
lake
nixon
had
least
certain
paddle
boats.
we
think
this
is
sufficient
again
to
show
that
lake
nixon's
sources
of
entertainment
had
affected
commerce,
and
therefore,
lake
nixon
as
a
whole
was
subject
to
the
ambit
or
title
ii.
and
what
we've
mentioned
here
as
another
and
further
ground
for
showing
that
lake
nixon
was
a
place
of
entertainment
or
exhibition,
that
local
people
might
well
come
there
to
be
entertained
either
by
their
family
or
by
their
friends
or
exhibiting
their
prows
in
any
given
area
of
lake
nixon's
facilities.
for
the
fifth
circuit
seating
on
bunk
in
the
miller
case,
this
kind
of
activity
was
sufficient
to
define
a
place
of
entertainment
and
we
submit
the
same
was
true
here.
mr.
conrad
k.
harper
that
--
mr.
conrad
k.
harper
that's
right.
dances
were
given
every
friday
or
saturday
at
lake
nixon.
the
evidence
however
does
show
further
that
the
musicians
who
played
live
at
those
dances
apparently
were
only
from
pulaski
county,
and
therefore,
were
not
in
commerce
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
mr.
conrad
k.
harper
oh,
yes.
we
certainly
ask
some
additional
source
for
showing
a
place
of
entertainment.
that
being
so
with
regard
to
title
ii,
we
turn
into
possible
coverage
under
the
1866
civil
rights
act.
1981
was
specifically
pleaded
in
this
case
in
the
complaint,
now
that
the
courts
below
passed
upon
it
because
this
court's
decision
in
jones
versus
meyer
company
did
was
not
handed
down
to
that
of
the
eighth
circuit
denied
rehearing
in
this
case.
we
think
it
manifest
that
this
was
an
ordinary
kind
of
contractual
arrangement,
one
paid
money
and
in
return
had
the
option
for
bailing
himself
of
services
located
at
lake
nixon,
and
the
evidence
is
uncontroverted
that
the
petitioners
in
this
case
were
denied
that
right,
that
contractual
right
if
you
will
on
the
grounds
have
raise.
we
think
nothing
could
be
clearer
as
violative
in
1981.
with
regards
to
1982
which
provides
for
equal
property
rights
and
no
denial
thereof
on
ground
of
raise,
we
think
could
clear
also
that
what
really
was
involved
here
was,
one,
have
the
opportunity
to
use
the
property
of
lake
nixon,
either
its
jukeboxes
or
its
miniature
golf
or
its
swimming
facilities,
and
therefore,
the
rational
of
the
jones
case
would
indicated
that
this
kind
of
property
should
not
be
denied
to
persons
on
grounds
or
breaks.
mr.
conrad
k.
harper
that's
right,
it
was
not
pleaded
below
and
none
of
the
courts
below
ruled
upon
the
issue.
however,
this
court
granted
certiorari
and
we
think
that
there's
ample
authority
for
this
court
to
dispose
of
the
case
on
that
ground
if
it
wishes.
mr.
conrad
k.
harper
under
title
ii
you
mean
or
under
1981?
mr.
conrad
k.
harper
oh
yes,
or
any
of
the
facilities,
but
that's
true.
mr.
conrad
k.
harper
that's
right,
that's
our
position.
mr.
conrad
k.
harper
which
open
to
the
general
public,
except
negroes,
that's
right.
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
shall
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
conrad
k.
harper
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
court.
with
reference
to
mr.
gallman's
last
point
concerning
the
disposition
of
the
lake
nixon
property.
rumor
came
to
our
attention
sometime
in
december
after
this
court
had
granted
certiorari
that
the
property
had
been
disposed
of.
where
upon
i
call
the
former
attorney
for
the
paul,
mr.
robinson,
i
believe
his
name
was.
he
indicated
he
was
not
then
their
attorney,
he's
understanding
was
that
they
did
not
wish
to
pursue
this
case.
however,
he
recommended
and
since
he
didn't
know
anything
more,
i
might
talk
with
mrs.
paul
and
mr.
paul.
so,
i
took
this
extraordinary
step
of
calling
mrs.
paul
directly
and
asked
her
whether
she
had
in
fact
disposed
of
the
property.
her
answer
was
“no”,
that
the
thought
it
was
under
contract
but
the
deal
had
not
been
consummated.
and
that
is
as
much
of
i
know
and
that
was
of
as
of
late
december,
1968.
with
reference
to
the
other
principal
question,
i'd
like
address
myself
to
now,
that
is
the
food
that
was
served
at
lake
nixon.
i
think
it's
efficient
for
this
court
if
it
wishes
to
--
mr.
conrad
k.
harper
i'm
sorry.
mr.
conrad
k.
harper
i
think
it
is
sufficient
for
this
court
if
it
wishes
to
undertake
to
look
at
this
case
the
way
it
look
to
the
case
as
hamm
versus
rock
hill.
there,
there
was
no
evidence
as
to
the
origin
of
the
food
involved
and
yet,
this
court
in
a
divided
opinion
or
a
divided
court
undertook
to
say
that
the
facilities
in
hamm
as
well
as
a
companion
case
where
in
fact
opened
to
the
public.
they
were
located
neither
or
five
and
dime
in
south
carolina
or
department
store
in
arkansas.
and
that
was
sufficient
that
court
felt
to
demonstrate
that
in
the
ordinary
course
interstate
connections
could
be
shown
as
to
the
origin
of
the
food.
we
think
that
situation
is
particularly
at
here
because
the
district
court
seating
at
little
rock
very
close
to
lake
nixon
undertook
to
say
that
as
far
as
he
was
concerned,
there
was
sufficient
--
a
connection
with
interstate
commerce
to
demonstrate
that
some
of
the
food
at
least
had
originated
outside
the
state.
therefore,
our
position
of
course
is
the
case
is
not
moot
and
the
complaint
i
might
mention
inclusion,
those
run
against
successors
in
addition
to
the
paul's,
who
believe
that
might
get
situation
here.
i
have
no
further
comments
unless
the
court
has
some
questions.
mr.
conrad
k.
harper
with
reference
to
the
food,
there
was
no
evidence,
what
the
court
found
was
that
some
of
the
ingredients
in
the
bread
had
originated
outside
of
the
state
as
far
as
he
was
concern,
and
that
ingredients
in
the
softdrinks
are
similarly
originated
outside
of
the
state.
but
there
was
no
testimony
with
reference
--
mr.
conrad
k.
harper
he
did
not
specify
which
ingredients.
although,
i
might
indicate
that
on
file
with
the
court
are
some
20
photographs
of
lake
nixon.
some
of
which
show
coca-cola
signs
and
it
may
have
been
had
that
in
mind
when
he
said
some
of
the
ingredients
of
softdrinks
originate
outside
of
arkansas.
thank
you.
