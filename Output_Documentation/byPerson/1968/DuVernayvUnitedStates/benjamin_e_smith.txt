mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
from
fifth
circuit
by
a
young
black
selective
service
registrant
from
conviction
at
least
in
district
of
louisiana,
for
refusal
to
be
inducted.
i
might
say,
the
ability
of
the
court
to
this
particular
registrant
when
all
the
way
through
the
system
up
to
the
point
of
where
he
was
asked
to
be
inducted
and
had
said
that
he
was
not
going
to
be
inducted.
now,
he
was
in
charged
by
indictment
in
courts,
tried
for
this
offense
in
federal
court
and
was
convicted.
now,
on
the
--
the
thing
that
happened
was
that
he
attempted
to
defend
his
defense
for
the
criminal
charge,
was
that
black
people
had
been
excluded
from
his
selective
service
board
and
in
the
midst
of
the
trial
of
the
case
below,
we
discovered
that
the
chairman
of
this
black
person's
board
was
the
president
of
the
united
ku
klux
klan
of
america,
manny
jackhill,
and
at
the
same
time,
we
found
out
in
the
process
of
counter
case
that
the
defendant
had
been
denied
an
appeal
by
his
board.
when
he
tried
to
tell
him
that
he
had
a
hardship
deferment,
it
turned
out
that
he
and
his
mother
with
his
sole
support
of
himself
and
six
and
brothers
and
sisters,
so
that
when
the
fifth
circuit
decided
this
case,
it
said
that
the
defenses
were
foreclosed
because
he
had
failed
to
exhaust
his
administrative
remedies
below.
but
i
say
to
you
that
that
can't
possibly
be
because
the
boards
below,
the
board
in
louisiana,
board
number
42
was
perfectly
incompetent
to
determine
whether
or
not
it
was
properly
composed,
whether
its
board
chairman
should
have
been
the
chairman
or
whether
there
should
have
been
the
board
dissolved
because
the
fact
that
negroes
were
excluded
from
service
on
the
board.
these
are
constitutional
issues
which
the
board
has
no
jurisdiction
over
and
which
could
not
be
raised
before
the
board
and
we'd
have
to
admit
be
necessarily
raised
before
the
court.
if
we
follow
judge
thornberry's
opinion
in
the
circuit,
it
would
necessarily
mean
that
these
serious
constitutional
issues
could
never
be
raised
because
we
know
they
can't
be
raised
before
the
board.
the
government
in
its
brief
here
agrees
with
us
on
that
point
and
they
cannot
then
under
the
thornberry
opinion
out
of
the
circuit
be
raised
in
the
federal
court
and
we
know
that
that
is
impossible.
if
we
cannot
raise
it
in
federal
court,
it
simply
means
that
this
defendant
would
then
go
to
jail
for
five
years
in
this
case
without
ever
having
been
able
to
raise
these
serious
constitutional
questions
in
any
court
competent
jurisdiction.
and
i
think
mr.
justice
murphy
when
he
wrote
the
concurring
opinion
in
esten
,
put
it
very
well,
he
said
that
if
at
some
point,
these
remedies
are
not
available,
well
then,
what's
going
to
happen
is
that
these
people
are
going
to
go
--
if
it
violates
due
process,
then
i'm
just
trying
to
find
the
citation.
to
sustain
the
conviction
of
the
two
petitioners
and
this
was
in
esten.
in
these
cases,
we'd
require
adherence
to
the
proposition
that
a
person
may
be
criminally
punished
without
ever
being
afforded
the
opportunity
to
prove
that
the
prosecution
is
based
on
an
invalid
administrative
order.
that
violates
the
most
elementary
and
fundamental
concepts
of
due
process
of
law.
now,
actually,
i
think
that
what
we're
trying
to
do
is
raise
a
constitutional
issue.
the
fact
that
negroes
were
excluded
from
the
board
and
the
chairman
was
a
clansman,
that
he
was
denied
of
appeal
and
the
fact
that
these
facts
were
not
raised
in
the
board
below,
in
the
draft
board
is
absolutely
irrelevant.
they
wouldn't
have
anything
to
do
with
this
classification.
if
he
had
waived
a
right
that
related
to
classification
and
we
were
up
here
talking
about
classification,
that
would
be
one
thing.
we're
not
talking
about
this
man's
classification.
we're
talking
about
his
constitutional
rights
to
talk
about
the
composition
of
that
draft.
and
what
would
be
the
effect,
i
ask
the
court,
of
saying
to
this
particular
thing,
you
can
never
raise
those
issues
in
the
board
and
you
can
never
raise
those
issues
in
this
court.
what
would
be
the
effect
on
the
selective
service
system?
because
the
selective
service
system
itself
is
based
upon
the
fairness
of
the
system
and
presumably
upon
the
knowledge
by
the
country
that
the
system
operates
in
a
fair
manner
that
it
reflects
the
qualities
of
life
in
america,
that
it
reflects
the
characteristics
of
the
community
where
the
people
lived
that
they
have
to
serve,
that
they
are
drafted
by
their
friends
and
neighbors
and
here
we
find
draft
boards
and
we
all
knew
it
in
louisiana
where
not
one
negro
had
ever
served.
and
they
had
an
open
clansman
on
the
board
and
they
knew
it
but
they
didn't
do
anything
about
it
until
after
this
case
when
they
got
rid
of
it.
but
what
the
confidence
of
the
country
would
be
shaken
in
these
boards
if
we
can't
raise
these
issues
and
i
say
that
we're
required
to
do
it.
we
can't
be
foreclosed
to
do
it.
the
circuit
opinion
in
this
regard
has
got
to
be
overruled.
i
can't
see
how
the
system
can
survive
knowing
where
the
country
knows
that
it
is
an
illegal
system,
it
operates
in
open
violation
of
the
thirteenth
and
fourteenth
amendment
and
what
the
government
says
in
the
--
what
does
the
government
say
in
defense
of
this?
they
say,
“well,
this
is
a
--
this
is
like
a
malapportioned
legislature.
this
is
--
this
is
really
not
too
bad,
you
know.”
but
actually,
what
they're
saying
and
it
would
violate
the
separation
of
powers
if
we
came
in
and
try
to
reform
the
system,
that's
where
we
raise
these
questions.
they
don't
want
these
questions
raised
before
this
court.
but
what
i'm
saying
what
they're
saying
is
that
the
executive
can
be
just
as
unconstitutional
as
he
wants
and
he
can
get
away
with
it.
the
thirteenth
and
fourteenth
amendment
applies
to
everybody
but
the
executive.
it
doesn't
apply
to
him.
and
let's
talk
about
the
practical
effect
of
a
young
black
militant
and
the
record
shows
that
that's
what
the
case
was
here.
this
was
a
young
man,
who
had
been
over
the
mississippi,
who
had
involved
himself
in
the
marches
of
mississippi.
had
been
arrested
to
civil
rights
act,
had
gone
down
and
tried
to
join
the
army
at
one
point
and
they
wouldn't
take
him
because
he'd
been
arrested
to
civil
rights
act.
they
didn't
have
the
rest
on
this
record
but
he's
good
enough
to
be
drafted
and
he's
good
enough
to
be
drafted
by
a
board
with
the
president
of
the
ku
klux
klan
only.
now,
what
kind
of
consideration
is
he
going
to
get
from
that
kind
of
a
board?
nothing.
and
if
he
has
an
appeal
he
wants
to
this
board,
he
has
a
reconsideration
of
his
case
to
be
made
to
that
board
and
he
did
in
this
case.
what
do
you
think
that
board
is
going
to
think
about
him?
you
read
the
minutes
in
this
record
with
how
the
board
treats
policemen,
firemen,
people
that
come
in
there
that
work
for
union
(inaudible)
that
have
people
go
in
far.
he
comes
in
with
his
mother.
he
says,
“for
the
first
time
in
my
life,
i
have
a
good
job.
i
work
for
the
part
of
the
agency,
i
make
$275.00
a
month.
i
give
$70.00
every
two
weeks
to
my
mother
and
when
--
this
is
what
he
needed
to
do.
this
is
what
he
was
telling
that
happened.
do
you
think
the
board
paid
any
attention
to
that?
twice,
even
his
employer
went
down
and
said,
“look,
he's
working
with
the
poor
in
the
city
of
new
orleans.”
it's
more
important,
we
think
than
to
work
in
that
lower
ninth
board
with
the
black
poor
that
it
his
family
be
down,
no.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
mr.
justice
stewart,
1625.2
says
that
board
has
discretion
to
reopen
after
a
notice
of
induction
at
issue.
we
all
know
that.
the
court
--
the
government
would
say,
your
powerless.
well,
that's
not
true.
if
you
look
in
the
minutes
of
the
board
that
we
put
in
our
brief,
they
had
a
policeman
coming
in
after
induction
and
you
know
what
it
did?
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
they
asked,
they
wrote
to
the
state
director
and
asked
him
for
him
to
do
an
induction
delay.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
didn't
re-classify
him
but
it's
just
a
backhanded
way
of
giving
him
a
deferment.
but
they
have
the
power
to
reopen
the
case
if
they
find
circumstances
over
which
this
defendant
or
this
--
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
they
still
have
no
control.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
yes
sir.
i
say,
in
the
brief
--
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
well,
as
the
way
i
put
it
and
you
know,
take
it,
or
not
but
i
think
that
it's
valid.
i
say,
i
think,
i
put
it
on
page
33.
i
said,
actually
they
reopened
this
case
mr.
justice
stewart.
i
say,
they
reopened
it
when
they
took
that
first
letter
of
april
27,
that's
the
number
three
or
something
like
that.
i
say,
that
they
did
do
this
to
show
in
all
likelihood
the
board
made
a
perfectly
reasonable
assumption
that
a
20-year
old
youth
who
finds
himself
with
the
first
real
steady
job
in
his
life
will
be
compelled
by
his
conscience
to
help
support
his
mother
and
six
brothers
and
sisters
who
her
mother
had
been
deserted
by
his
father
many
years
before.
and
i
say
that
this
was
a
change
in
circumstances
to
this
young
man
and
it
was
in
effect
because
he
had
to
support
these
children,
that
it
was
beyond
his
control.
now,
i
see
nothing
in
the
reason
in
that
interpretation
of
1625.2
and
certainly
we
have
to
recognize
that
he
was
impelled
to
a
certain
course
of
action
and
he
was
fulfilling
his
responsibilities
to
his
family.
and
i
say
that
when
that
sort
of
thin
happens
and
he
goes
right
through
every
remedy.
we
don't
have
a
fallible
problem,
we
don't
have
an
(inaudible)
problem,
we
have
as
much
right
to
exert
thirteenth
and
fourteenth
amendment
principles
in
this
case
as
wolff
did,
first
amendment
in
his
case.
they
are
no
less
dear
to
his
and
no
less
important.
i
would
say
--
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
he
was
chairman
of
the
board.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
and
he
was
also
chairman
when
the
man,
when
my
client
was
doing
up
there
and
asking
him
for
this
exemption.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
yes
sir.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
in
my
recollection,
i
may
be
wrong
but
i'm
pretty
sure
that
he
was
there.
i
remember
deleting
that
as
a
matter
of
fact.
and
i
think
it
was
after
this.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
i
didn't
make
an
offer
of
proof.
they
cut
me
off
in
the
question
and
i
guess
it
showed
them
but
i
didn't
but
that
was
it.
i
was
prepared
to
show
not
only
that
he
was
a
ku
klux
leader
and
everybody
knew
but
then
he
lived
in
the
office,
effectively
did
he
live.
i
haven't
raised
that
as
our
key
argument
but
we
all
knew
it.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
well,
he
didn't
live
around
there.
he
lived
over
in
bogalusa,
over
in
washington
parish.
that's
where
his
clan
activity
were.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
that's
right.
he
was
out
of
the
county.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
well,
it's
parish
counties.
we
use
parishes
instead
of
counties.
he
maintain
a
residence
in
new
orleans
parish
but
also
his
main
business
where
live
was
over
there
with
those
ku
kluxes
in
bogalusa
but
--
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
sir?
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
well,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
i
suspect
they
could
be.
i
think
the
government
got
rid
of
mr.
helm
after
this
right
away.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
they
got
rid
of
mr.
helm,
the
chairman.
they
got
him
off
that
board
after
this
case
was
over
and
i
guess
you
could
go
back
quo
warranto
and
remove
him
but
you
see
we
didn't
ignore
the
kind
of
board
we
were
working
with
mr.
justice
black
until
we
got
right
in
the
middle
of
the
trial
and
there's
no
way
for
these
registrants.
this
responsibility
of
the
system
to
police
these
boards,
not
the
responsibility
of
the
registrants
but
we
did
more
good
in
expose
of
these
kind
of
thing
and
i
think
in
this
case
and
the
whole
system
had
done
for
years
down
there.
they
just
didn't
care.
but
you
know
--
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
well,
i
think
if
i
were
a
black
man
that
got
drafted
by
this
board
number
42,
i'd
go
see
a
lawyer.
i
think
you
ought
to.
if
he's
got
something
that
he
really
wanted
to
raise
to
that
board
and
try
to,
he
wouldn't
have
got
a
fair
shake.
and
he
didn't
have
to
show
that
he
didn't
get
a
fair
shake.
i
think
you
just
show
that
that
board
was
what
it
was.
and
--
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
they
are
suggested
to
the
president
by
the
governor
of
the
state.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
and
they're
appointed
by
the
president
of
the
united
states
and
i
think
they
serve
a
term
or
they
serve
a
displeasure,
i'm
not
only
ever
sure
but
they
just
weren't
any
negroes
that
had
any
political
pool
to
get
on
any
of
these
votes.
that's
exactly
what
was
happening.
they
were
playing
local
politics.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
was
--
oh
yes,
here's
--
the
state
of
the
record
is
this.
at
the
time
of
the
hearing
on
the
motion
to
quash
the
indictment
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
started
asking
questions
about
were
there
any
blacks
ever
served
on
the
board.
i
was
cut
off
by
objections
and
then
i
got
the
u.s.
attorney
who
was
with
me
there
and
trying
the
case
to
admit
an
open
court
before
justice
christenberry
that
there
had
been
no
negroes
that
had
serve
on
that
board
for
the
last
five
years
as
far
as
he
knew
and
judge
christenberry
then
took
judicial
notice
of
the
fact
that
all
the
members
of
the
board
were
white.
and
then
he
denied
my
motion
to
quash
the
bill
of
indictment
and
that's
the
state
of
the
record
on
that
issue.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
on
the
trial
of
the
case,
after
august
30,
1966,
in
the
course
of
interrogating
the
then
chairman
of
the
board,
mr.
lizano,
i
said
asking
if
he
was
the
chairman
and
he
said
yes.
and
i
said,
“did
you
replace
mr.
helm?”
he
said
yes
he
did.
and
i
said,
“was
this
the
same
mr.
helm
that
had
been
accused
of
being
a
ku
klux
or
being
accused
of
ku
klux
klan
activities
and
at
that
point,
i
got
my
objections
on
the
government
and
judge
christenberry
upheld
the
objection.
i
then
went
on
to
do
his
as
best
as
i
could
under
circumstances
and
established
that
mr.
helm
was
a
chairman
at
the
time
of
the
original
classification
and
i
think
i
don't
whether
there
are
established,
20
left
the
board
or
not.
on
page
43
of
the
record,
you'll
find
what
i
just
described
mr.
justice
harlan.
i
said,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
wasn't
even
the
same
mr.
helm
that
had
been
accused
of
being
of
a
member
of
the
ku
klux
klan.
i
objected
the
question,
if
the
court
please
to
have
the
relevancy
objection
sustained.
mr.
helm
was
a
member
of
the
board
when
mr.
duvernay
was
originally
classified.
i
think
he
was.
right,
according
to
the
record
it
showed
it
was.
that's
right.
and
i
think
some
of
the
records
that
relates
to
some
of
the
minutes
of
the
board
that
we
put
in
evidence
here
show
that
helm
was
chairman
on
some
other
instances
but
i'm
not
sure
they'll
have
to
show
it.
well,
i
think
that's
all
have
to
say.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
i'll
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
i
only
have
a
few
thing
i
want
to
talk
about
in
connection
with
what
has
been
said
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
that
ill
becomes
the
government
to
get
up
here
and
say
that
there
has
been
no
prejudice
in
this
case
and
that
there
has
to
be
shown
to
be
prejudice.
we
know
very
well
from
the
jury
cases
that
have
come
before
this
court
and
others
that
if
we
show
a
patent
in
practice
of
exclusion
of
black
people
from
juries,
we'd
all
have
to
show
prejudice.
it's
right
--
built
into
the
system
right
there,
that
it's
there.
the
jury
cases
don't
make
you
go
out
and
show
that
you
would
have
gotten
a
better
break
from
a
properly
constituted
jury.
we
don't
have
to
show
that
in
this
case
but
it's
all
over
the
record
that
we
did
get
that
kind
of
treatment.
and
i'll
tell
you
why.
this
man
was
not
only
classified
by
that
board
but
when
he
tried
to
get
his
hardship
deferment,
it
was
still
the
same
white
board
that
said
no.
look
at
the
record,
the
way
that
court
writes
the
letters,
“no,
no.
we
can't
help
you.”
the
employer
goes
down,
“no,
we
can't
help
you.”
i
know
what
was
happening.
that
white
board
was
sitting
there
as
white,
some
were
white
men.
they
didn't
know
this
young
black
militant,(inaudible)
problems.
they
didn't
know
anything
about
the
kind
of
life
he
lived.
they
didn't
know
anything
about
what
his
family
life
had
been.
they
didn't
know
--
they
didn't
give
him
any
benefit
of
having
--
of
not
knowing
how
to
read
the
federal
register.
and
they
said
no.
but
the
cops
come
in,
the
police
come
in
and
i
know
wrong.
he
covers
in
there,
it's
on
this
page
in
my
brief,
39
and
this
is
what
they
say
about
roth,
the
policeman,
“request
for
deferment
filed
by
the
department
of
police
in
behalf
of
william
t.
roth”
and
they
give
his
number
“scheduled
for
induction.”
he
was
under
a
notice
of
induction
just
like
this
man
is.
presently
under
attendance
of
the
police
academy,
it's
at
footnote
on
page
39
was
acting
on
by
the
board.
that
means
they're
acting
only
after
1625.2.
the
induction
had
gone
out.
“the
board
concurred
in
granting
the
deferment,
thereby
requesting
the
state
director
to
cancel
registrant's
induction."
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
yes
sir.
it
says,
here
the
board
concurred
in
granting
the
deferment.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
he
volunteered.
i
know
the
man,
he
volunteered
to
attend
the
academy.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
i
can't
tell
from
here
that
he
is
a
policeman
in
training.
and
the
police
department
neither
do.
so
they
went
in
and
the
white
men
in
this
board,
knew
what
the
problems
of
the
police
were
mr.
justice
stewart
and
that
was
when
they
did
it.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
it
might
have
been.
but
at
the
same
time
they
say
1625.2
is
so
important
a
regulation
this
government
has
--
i
mean
this
court
has
to
preserve.
well,
if
it's
so
important,
why
don't
they
tell
these
registrants
about
it?
why
don't
they
write
them
a
book
and
tell
them,
“look,
if
you
don't
go
in
there
in
ten
days,
you're
forever
foreclosed.”
this
guy
didn't
know
it
that
when
he
went
to
work
and
start
supporting
those
kids,
then
he
had
to
tell
him
that
within
ten
days
or
he
never
would
be
able
to
do
it
again.
it
wasn't
written
in
the
sky
and
the
little
card
that
he
didn't
even
looked
at
and
it
didn't
really
say
what
happens
if
you
don't
do
that
after
ten
days.
why
--
why
couldn't
they
just
simply
say,
“alright,
you
come
in,
you
got
it.”
well,
it
didn't
do
it.
and
the
fact
is
that
the
kind
of
board
he
had
was
just
exactly
the
kind
of
prejudice
that
we're
talking
about.
this
is
the
prejudice.
they
didn't
have
a
standard
--
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
yes
sir.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
not
to
my
knowledge
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
yes,
i
think
that's
true
too.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
yes.
and
as
you
go
on
into
this
question
he
raised
mr.
justice
white
about
whether
you
could
raise
this
question
on
appeal.
it's
answered
by
what
i
think
been
said
by
the
justice
on
the
court.
he
didn't
know
and
i
wouldn't
know
really
if
he
had
taken
an
appeal
to
raise
this
question
of
composition
of
the
board
justice
stewart.
he
didn't
know
anything
about
that.
he
couldn't
be
expected
to
know
anything
about
that.
it
would
have
been
a
futile
business
anyway
because
that
appeals
board
is
not
going
to
knock
out
its
own
--
it's
a
constitutional
defense.
it
has
to
be
raised
in
the
court
of
laws
even
though
there
might
be
lawyers
on
the
board.
it
doesn't
make
any
difference.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
well,
i
guess
they
are.
i
don't
know
but
i
would
think
that
it's
most
appropriate
--
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
yes
they
are
but
mainly
what
the
boards
are
here
for
is
to
use
their
expertise
in
classification
and
at
the
same
time,
i
think
it's
going
to
be
very
difficult
and
sort
of
an
unrealistic
to
simply
say
to
the
board,
“look,
you're
badly
constituted.
wipe
yourself
out.”
in
effect,
then
i
couldn't
do
that.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
from
fifth
circuit
by
a
young
black
selective
service
registrant
from
conviction
at
least
in
district
of
louisiana,
for
refusal
to
be
inducted.
i
might
say,
the
ability
of
the
court
to
this
particular
registrant
when
all
the
way
through
the
system
up
to
the
point
of
where
he
was
asked
to
be
inducted
and
had
said
that
he
was
not
going
to
be
inducted.
now,
he
was
in
charged
by
indictment
in
courts,
tried
for
this
offense
in
federal
court
and
was
convicted.
now,
on
the
--
the
thing
that
happened
was
that
he
attempted
to
defend
his
defense
for
the
criminal
charge,
was
that
black
people
had
been
excluded
from
his
selective
service
board
and
in
the
midst
of
the
trial
of
the
case
below,
we
discovered
that
the
chairman
of
this
black
person's
board
was
the
president
of
the
united
ku
klux
klan
of
america,
manny
jackhill,
and
at
the
same
time,
we
found
out
in
the
process
of
counter
case
that
the
defendant
had
been
denied
an
appeal
by
his
board.
when
he
tried
to
tell
him
that
he
had
a
hardship
deferment,
it
turned
out
that
he
and
his
mother
with
his
sole
support
of
himself
and
six
and
brothers
and
sisters,
so
that
when
the
fifth
circuit
decided
this
case,
it
said
that
the
defenses
were
foreclosed
because
he
had
failed
to
exhaust
his
administrative
remedies
below.
but
i
say
to
you
that
that
can't
possibly
be
because
the
boards
below,
the
board
in
louisiana,
board
number
42
was
perfectly
incompetent
to
determine
whether
or
not
it
was
properly
composed,
whether
its
board
chairman
should
have
been
the
chairman
or
whether
there
should
have
been
the
board
dissolved
because
the
fact
that
negroes
were
excluded
from
service
on
the
board.
these
are
constitutional
issues
which
the
board
has
no
jurisdiction
over
and
which
could
not
be
raised
before
the
board
and
we'd
have
to
admit
be
necessarily
raised
before
the
court.
if
we
follow
judge
thornberry's
opinion
in
the
circuit,
it
would
necessarily
mean
that
these
serious
constitutional
issues
could
never
be
raised
because
we
know
they
can't
be
raised
before
the
board.
the
government
in
its
brief
here
agrees
with
us
on
that
point
and
they
cannot
then
under
the
thornberry
opinion
out
of
the
circuit
be
raised
in
the
federal
court
and
we
know
that
that
is
impossible.
if
we
cannot
raise
it
in
federal
court,
it
simply
means
that
this
defendant
would
then
go
to
jail
for
five
years
in
this
case
without
ever
having
been
able
to
raise
these
serious
constitutional
questions
in
any
court
competent
jurisdiction.
and
i
think
mr.
justice
murphy
when
he
wrote
the
concurring
opinion
in
esten
,
put
it
very
well,
he
said
that
if
at
some
point,
these
remedies
are
not
available,
well
then,
what's
going
to
happen
is
that
these
people
are
going
to
go
--
if
it
violates
due
process,
then
i'm
just
trying
to
find
the
citation.
to
sustain
the
conviction
of
the
two
petitioners
and
this
was
in
esten.
in
these
cases,
we'd
require
adherence
to
the
proposition
that
a
person
may
be
criminally
punished
without
ever
being
afforded
the
opportunity
to
prove
that
the
prosecution
is
based
on
an
invalid
administrative
order.
that
violates
the
most
elementary
and
fundamental
concepts
of
due
process
of
law.
now,
actually,
i
think
that
what
we're
trying
to
do
is
raise
a
constitutional
issue.
the
fact
that
negroes
were
excluded
from
the
board
and
the
chairman
was
a
clansman,
that
he
was
denied
of
appeal
and
the
fact
that
these
facts
were
not
raised
in
the
board
below,
in
the
draft
board
is
absolutely
irrelevant.
they
wouldn't
have
anything
to
do
with
this
classification.
if
he
had
waived
a
right
that
related
to
classification
and
we
were
up
here
talking
about
classification,
that
would
be
one
thing.
we're
not
talking
about
this
man's
classification.
we're
talking
about
his
constitutional
rights
to
talk
about
the
composition
of
that
draft.
and
what
would
be
the
effect,
i
ask
the
court,
of
saying
to
this
particular
thing,
you
can
never
raise
those
issues
in
the
board
and
you
can
never
raise
those
issues
in
this
court.
what
would
be
the
effect
on
the
selective
service
system?
because
the
selective
service
system
itself
is
based
upon
the
fairness
of
the
system
and
presumably
upon
the
knowledge
by
the
country
that
the
system
operates
in
a
fair
manner
that
it
reflects
the
qualities
of
life
in
america,
that
it
reflects
the
characteristics
of
the
community
where
the
people
lived
that
they
have
to
serve,
that
they
are
drafted
by
their
friends
and
neighbors
and
here
we
find
draft
boards
and
we
all
knew
it
in
louisiana
where
not
one
negro
had
ever
served.
and
they
had
an
open
clansman
on
the
board
and
they
knew
it
but
they
didn't
do
anything
about
it
until
after
this
case
when
they
got
rid
of
it.
but
what
the
confidence
of
the
country
would
be
shaken
in
these
boards
if
we
can't
raise
these
issues
and
i
say
that
we're
required
to
do
it.
we
can't
be
foreclosed
to
do
it.
the
circuit
opinion
in
this
regard
has
got
to
be
overruled.
i
can't
see
how
the
system
can
survive
knowing
where
the
country
knows
that
it
is
an
illegal
system,
it
operates
in
open
violation
of
the
thirteenth
and
fourteenth
amendment
and
what
the
government
says
in
the
--
what
does
the
government
say
in
defense
of
this?
they
say,
“well,
this
is
a
--
this
is
like
a
malapportioned
legislature.
this
is
--
this
is
really
not
too
bad,
you
know.”
but
actually,
what
they're
saying
and
it
would
violate
the
separation
of
powers
if
we
came
in
and
try
to
reform
the
system,
that's
where
we
raise
these
questions.
they
don't
want
these
questions
raised
before
this
court.
but
what
i'm
saying
what
they're
saying
is
that
the
executive
can
be
just
as
unconstitutional
as
he
wants
and
he
can
get
away
with
it.
the
thirteenth
and
fourteenth
amendment
applies
to
everybody
but
the
executive.
it
doesn't
apply
to
him.
and
let's
talk
about
the
practical
effect
of
a
young
black
militant
and
the
record
shows
that
that's
what
the
case
was
here.
this
was
a
young
man,
who
had
been
over
the
mississippi,
who
had
involved
himself
in
the
marches
of
mississippi.
had
been
arrested
to
civil
rights
act,
had
gone
down
and
tried
to
join
the
army
at
one
point
and
they
wouldn't
take
him
because
he'd
been
arrested
to
civil
rights
act.
they
didn't
have
the
rest
on
this
record
but
he's
good
enough
to
be
drafted
and
he's
good
enough
to
be
drafted
by
a
board
with
the
president
of
the
ku
klux
klan
only.
now,
what
kind
of
consideration
is
he
going
to
get
from
that
kind
of
a
board?
nothing.
and
if
he
has
an
appeal
he
wants
to
this
board,
he
has
a
reconsideration
of
his
case
to
be
made
to
that
board
and
he
did
in
this
case.
what
do
you
think
that
board
is
going
to
think
about
him?
you
read
the
minutes
in
this
record
with
how
the
board
treats
policemen,
firemen,
people
that
come
in
there
that
work
for
union
(inaudible)
that
have
people
go
in
far.
he
comes
in
with
his
mother.
he
says,
“for
the
first
time
in
my
life,
i
have
a
good
job.
i
work
for
the
part
of
the
agency,
i
make
$275.00
a
month.
i
give
$70.00
every
two
weeks
to
my
mother
and
when
--
this
is
what
he
needed
to
do.
this
is
what
he
was
telling
that
happened.
do
you
think
the
board
paid
any
attention
to
that?
twice,
even
his
employer
went
down
and
said,
“look,
he's
working
with
the
poor
in
the
city
of
new
orleans.”
it's
more
important,
we
think
than
to
work
in
that
lower
ninth
board
with
the
black
poor
that
it
his
family
be
down,
no.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
mr.
justice
stewart,
1625.2
says
that
board
has
discretion
to
reopen
after
a
notice
of
induction
at
issue.
we
all
know
that.
the
court
--
the
government
would
say,
your
powerless.
well,
that's
not
true.
if
you
look
in
the
minutes
of
the
board
that
we
put
in
our
brief,
they
had
a
policeman
coming
in
after
induction
and
you
know
what
it
did?
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
they
asked,
they
wrote
to
the
state
director
and
asked
him
for
him
to
do
an
induction
delay.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
didn't
re-classify
him
but
it's
just
a
backhanded
way
of
giving
him
a
deferment.
but
they
have
the
power
to
reopen
the
case
if
they
find
circumstances
over
which
this
defendant
or
this
--
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
they
still
have
no
control.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
yes
sir.
i
say,
in
the
brief
--
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
well,
as
the
way
i
put
it
and
you
know,
take
it,
or
not
but
i
think
that
it's
valid.
i
say,
i
think,
i
put
it
on
page
33.
i
said,
actually
they
reopened
this
case
mr.
justice
stewart.
i
say,
they
reopened
it
when
they
took
that
first
letter
of
april
27,
that's
the
number
three
or
something
like
that.
i
say,
that
they
did
do
this
to
show
in
all
likelihood
the
board
made
a
perfectly
reasonable
assumption
that
a
20-year
old
youth
who
finds
himself
with
the
first
real
steady
job
in
his
life
will
be
compelled
by
his
conscience
to
help
support
his
mother
and
six
brothers
and
sisters
who
her
mother
had
been
deserted
by
his
father
many
years
before.
and
i
say
that
this
was
a
change
in
circumstances
to
this
young
man
and
it
was
in
effect
because
he
had
to
support
these
children,
that
it
was
beyond
his
control.
now,
i
see
nothing
in
the
reason
in
that
interpretation
of
1625.2
and
certainly
we
have
to
recognize
that
he
was
impelled
to
a
certain
course
of
action
and
he
was
fulfilling
his
responsibilities
to
his
family.
and
i
say
that
when
that
sort
of
thin
happens
and
he
goes
right
through
every
remedy.
we
don't
have
a
fallible
problem,
we
don't
have
an
(inaudible)
problem,
we
have
as
much
right
to
exert
thirteenth
and
fourteenth
amendment
principles
in
this
case
as
wolff
did,
first
amendment
in
his
case.
they
are
no
less
dear
to
his
and
no
less
important.
i
would
say
--
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
he
was
chairman
of
the
board.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
and
he
was
also
chairman
when
the
man,
when
my
client
was
doing
up
there
and
asking
him
for
this
exemption.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
yes
sir.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
in
my
recollection,
i
may
be
wrong
but
i'm
pretty
sure
that
he
was
there.
i
remember
deleting
that
as
a
matter
of
fact.
and
i
think
it
was
after
this.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
i
didn't
make
an
offer
of
proof.
they
cut
me
off
in
the
question
and
i
guess
it
showed
them
but
i
didn't
but
that
was
it.
i
was
prepared
to
show
not
only
that
he
was
a
ku
klux
leader
and
everybody
knew
but
then
he
lived
in
the
office,
effectively
did
he
live.
i
haven't
raised
that
as
our
key
argument
but
we
all
knew
it.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
well,
he
didn't
live
around
there.
he
lived
over
in
bogalusa,
over
in
washington
parish.
that's
where
his
clan
activity
were.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
that's
right.
he
was
out
of
the
county.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
well,
it's
parish
counties.
we
use
parishes
instead
of
counties.
he
maintain
a
residence
in
new
orleans
parish
but
also
his
main
business
where
live
was
over
there
with
those
ku
kluxes
in
bogalusa
but
--
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
sir?
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
well,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
i
suspect
they
could
be.
i
think
the
government
got
rid
of
mr.
helm
after
this
right
away.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
they
got
rid
of
mr.
helm,
the
chairman.
they
got
him
off
that
board
after
this
case
was
over
and
i
guess
you
could
go
back
quo
warranto
and
remove
him
but
you
see
we
didn't
ignore
the
kind
of
board
we
were
working
with
mr.
justice
black
until
we
got
right
in
the
middle
of
the
trial
and
there's
no
way
for
these
registrants.
this
responsibility
of
the
system
to
police
these
boards,
not
the
responsibility
of
the
registrants
but
we
did
more
good
in
expose
of
these
kind
of
thing
and
i
think
in
this
case
and
the
whole
system
had
done
for
years
down
there.
they
just
didn't
care.
but
you
know
--
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
well,
i
think
if
i
were
a
black
man
that
got
drafted
by
this
board
number
42,
i'd
go
see
a
lawyer.
i
think
you
ought
to.
if
he's
got
something
that
he
really
wanted
to
raise
to
that
board
and
try
to,
he
wouldn't
have
got
a
fair
shake.
and
he
didn't
have
to
show
that
he
didn't
get
a
fair
shake.
i
think
you
just
show
that
that
board
was
what
it
was.
and
--
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
they
are
suggested
to
the
president
by
the
governor
of
the
state.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
and
they're
appointed
by
the
president
of
the
united
states
and
i
think
they
serve
a
term
or
they
serve
a
displeasure,
i'm
not
only
ever
sure
but
they
just
weren't
any
negroes
that
had
any
political
pool
to
get
on
any
of
these
votes.
that's
exactly
what
was
happening.
they
were
playing
local
politics.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
was
--
oh
yes,
here's
--
the
state
of
the
record
is
this.
at
the
time
of
the
hearing
on
the
motion
to
quash
the
indictment
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
started
asking
questions
about
were
there
any
blacks
ever
served
on
the
board.
i
was
cut
off
by
objections
and
then
i
got
the
u.s.
attorney
who
was
with
me
there
and
trying
the
case
to
admit
an
open
court
before
justice
christenberry
that
there
had
been
no
negroes
that
had
serve
on
that
board
for
the
last
five
years
as
far
as
he
knew
and
judge
christenberry
then
took
judicial
notice
of
the
fact
that
all
the
members
of
the
board
were
white.
and
then
he
denied
my
motion
to
quash
the
bill
of
indictment
and
that's
the
state
of
the
record
on
that
issue.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
on
the
trial
of
the
case,
after
august
30,
1966,
in
the
course
of
interrogating
the
then
chairman
of
the
board,
mr.
lizano,
i
said
asking
if
he
was
the
chairman
and
he
said
yes.
and
i
said,
“did
you
replace
mr.
helm?”
he
said
yes
he
did.
and
i
said,
“was
this
the
same
mr.
helm
that
had
been
accused
of
being
a
ku
klux
or
being
accused
of
ku
klux
klan
activities
and
at
that
point,
i
got
my
objections
on
the
government
and
judge
christenberry
upheld
the
objection.
i
then
went
on
to
do
his
as
best
as
i
could
under
circumstances
and
established
that
mr.
helm
was
a
chairman
at
the
time
of
the
original
classification
and
i
think
i
don't
whether
there
are
established,
20
left
the
board
or
not.
on
page
43
of
the
record,
you'll
find
what
i
just
described
mr.
justice
harlan.
i
said,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
wasn't
even
the
same
mr.
helm
that
had
been
accused
of
being
of
a
member
of
the
ku
klux
klan.
i
objected
the
question,
if
the
court
please
to
have
the
relevancy
objection
sustained.
mr.
helm
was
a
member
of
the
board
when
mr.
duvernay
was
originally
classified.
i
think
he
was.
right,
according
to
the
record
it
showed
it
was.
that's
right.
and
i
think
some
of
the
records
that
relates
to
some
of
the
minutes
of
the
board
that
we
put
in
evidence
here
show
that
helm
was
chairman
on
some
other
instances
but
i'm
not
sure
they'll
have
to
show
it.
well,
i
think
that's
all
have
to
say.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
i'll
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
i
only
have
a
few
thing
i
want
to
talk
about
in
connection
with
what
has
been
said
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
that
ill
becomes
the
government
to
get
up
here
and
say
that
there
has
been
no
prejudice
in
this
case
and
that
there
has
to
be
shown
to
be
prejudice.
we
know
very
well
from
the
jury
cases
that
have
come
before
this
court
and
others
that
if
we
show
a
patent
in
practice
of
exclusion
of
black
people
from
juries,
we'd
all
have
to
show
prejudice.
it's
right
--
built
into
the
system
right
there,
that
it's
there.
the
jury
cases
don't
make
you
go
out
and
show
that
you
would
have
gotten
a
better
break
from
a
properly
constituted
jury.
we
don't
have
to
show
that
in
this
case
but
it's
all
over
the
record
that
we
did
get
that
kind
of
treatment.
and
i'll
tell
you
why.
this
man
was
not
only
classified
by
that
board
but
when
he
tried
to
get
his
hardship
deferment,
it
was
still
the
same
white
board
that
said
no.
look
at
the
record,
the
way
that
court
writes
the
letters,
“no,
no.
we
can't
help
you.”
the
employer
goes
down,
“no,
we
can't
help
you.”
i
know
what
was
happening.
that
white
board
was
sitting
there
as
white,
some
were
white
men.
they
didn't
know
this
young
black
militant,(inaudible)
problems.
they
didn't
know
anything
about
the
kind
of
life
he
lived.
they
didn't
know
anything
about
what
his
family
life
had
been.
they
didn't
know
--
they
didn't
give
him
any
benefit
of
having
--
of
not
knowing
how
to
read
the
federal
register.
and
they
said
no.
but
the
cops
come
in,
the
police
come
in
and
i
know
wrong.
he
covers
in
there,
it's
on
this
page
in
my
brief,
39
and
this
is
what
they
say
about
roth,
the
policeman,
“request
for
deferment
filed
by
the
department
of
police
in
behalf
of
william
t.
roth”
and
they
give
his
number
“scheduled
for
induction.”
he
was
under
a
notice
of
induction
just
like
this
man
is.
presently
under
attendance
of
the
police
academy,
it's
at
footnote
on
page
39
was
acting
on
by
the
board.
that
means
they're
acting
only
after
1625.2.
the
induction
had
gone
out.
“the
board
concurred
in
granting
the
deferment,
thereby
requesting
the
state
director
to
cancel
registrant's
induction."
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
yes
sir.
it
says,
here
the
board
concurred
in
granting
the
deferment.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
he
volunteered.
i
know
the
man,
he
volunteered
to
attend
the
academy.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
i
can't
tell
from
here
that
he
is
a
policeman
in
training.
and
the
police
department
neither
do.
so
they
went
in
and
the
white
men
in
this
board,
knew
what
the
problems
of
the
police
were
mr.
justice
stewart
and
that
was
when
they
did
it.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
it
might
have
been.
but
at
the
same
time
they
say
1625.2
is
so
important
a
regulation
this
government
has
--
i
mean
this
court
has
to
preserve.
well,
if
it's
so
important,
why
don't
they
tell
these
registrants
about
it?
why
don't
they
write
them
a
book
and
tell
them,
“look,
if
you
don't
go
in
there
in
ten
days,
you're
forever
foreclosed.”
this
guy
didn't
know
it
that
when
he
went
to
work
and
start
supporting
those
kids,
then
he
had
to
tell
him
that
within
ten
days
or
he
never
would
be
able
to
do
it
again.
it
wasn't
written
in
the
sky
and
the
little
card
that
he
didn't
even
looked
at
and
it
didn't
really
say
what
happens
if
you
don't
do
that
after
ten
days.
why
--
why
couldn't
they
just
simply
say,
“alright,
you
come
in,
you
got
it.”
well,
it
didn't
do
it.
and
the
fact
is
that
the
kind
of
board
he
had
was
just
exactly
the
kind
of
prejudice
that
we're
talking
about.
this
is
the
prejudice.
they
didn't
have
a
standard
--
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
yes
sir.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
not
to
my
knowledge
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
yes,
i
think
that's
true
too.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
yes.
and
as
you
go
on
into
this
question
he
raised
mr.
justice
white
about
whether
you
could
raise
this
question
on
appeal.
it's
answered
by
what
i
think
been
said
by
the
justice
on
the
court.
he
didn't
know
and
i
wouldn't
know
really
if
he
had
taken
an
appeal
to
raise
this
question
of
composition
of
the
board
justice
stewart.
he
didn't
know
anything
about
that.
he
couldn't
be
expected
to
know
anything
about
that.
it
would
have
been
a
futile
business
anyway
because
that
appeals
board
is
not
going
to
knock
out
its
own
--
it's
a
constitutional
defense.
it
has
to
be
raised
in
the
court
of
laws
even
though
there
might
be
lawyers
on
the
board.
it
doesn't
make
any
difference.
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
well,
i
guess
they
are.
i
don't
know
but
i
would
think
that
it's
most
appropriate
--
mr.
benjamin
e.
smith
yes
they
are
but
mainly
what
the
boards
are
here
for
is
to
use
their
expertise
in
classification
and
at
the
same
time,
i
think
it's
going
to
be
very
difficult
and
sort
of
an
unrealistic
to
simply
say
to
the
board,
“look,
you're
badly
constituted.
wipe
yourself
out.”
in
effect,
then
i
couldn't
do
that.
thank
you
very
much.
