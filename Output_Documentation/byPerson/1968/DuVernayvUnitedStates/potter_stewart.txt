did
the

have
a

to
do
anything
at
the

that
he
brought
--
justice

the

induction?
justice

stewart
but
they
didn't
re-classify.
justice

and
no
control.
justice
potter
stewart
but
that
--
you're
not
alleging
that,
are
you?
justice
potter
stewart
what
circumstances
over
which
he
had
no
control?
justice
potter
stewart
the
--
this
ku
klux
klan
leader
was
a
member
of
the
board
against
--
what
chairman
of
the
board?
justice
potter
stewart
at
the
time
your
client
was
the
classified
1-a,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
he
was.
justice
potter
stewart
i
saw
some
little
difference,
i
saw
some
little
difference
in
the
opinion
on
then
the
briefs
that
he
left
by
the
time
your
--
justice
potter
stewart
although
you
weren't
allowed
to
show
that
way.
did
you
make
an
offer
of
proof?
justice
potter
stewart
were
the
statute,
as
i
understand
that
the
members
of
the
draft
board
have
to
be
residents
of
the
county,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
in
louisiana
you
have
parishes
in
that
counties
but
i
suppose.
justice
potter
stewart
but
you're
not
--
i
didn't
get
to
that.
i
was
foreclosed.
i
was
go
into
action
but
i
wouldn't.
justice
potter
stewart
it
didn't
give
the
opportunity.
now,
the
government
makes
a
whole
lot
of
business
about
this
failure
to
postpone
or
to
appeal
of
1a
classification
of
january
16,
1966
because
i
just
called
effect.
of
course,
attention
to
the
fact
that
that's
really
irrelevant
here
because
when
they
got
classified
in
january
1-a
from
2-s,
he
had
nothing
to
appeal
from.
he
was
properly
classified
1-a
at
that
time.
he
was
a
young
man
who
dropped
out
school.
he
was
not
supporting
anybody.
he
was
properly
--
so
there
was
no
need
to
appeal.
so
that
can't
be
said
to
be
a
reason
below.
it
doesn't
relate
at
all
to
the
composition
of
this
boy.
then
i
have
to
point
to
the
court
most
respectfully,
this
man
had
no
way
of
knowing
who
his
chairman
was,
what
his
activities
were.
he
had
no
way
of
knowing
whether
that
board
was
segregated
or
whether
it
was
--
had
any
negroes
on
or
not.
he
asked
to
go
before
the
board
and
at
one
time,
he
was
tentatively
promised
a
chance
to
go
before
that
board
but
they
took
it
back,
they
wouldn't
let
him
go,
so
he
had
never
laid
eyes
in
the
board.
but
--
so
i
say
again
that
how
could
he
know.
we
didn't
know
half
of
this
case
until
we
started
discovering
it
in
the
criminal
trial.
there
was
no
way
we
could
either
get
the
information
ahead
of
a
criminal
trial.
as
appears
those
records
in
the
middle
of
the
trial
that
bring
him
in
and
you
see
how
this
board
operates.
they
couldn't
even
remember
whether
they
imposed
on
these
cases
or
not?
i
don't
think
they
did.
but
then,
what
i
--
i
think
the
whole
thing
is
of
appease.
it
was
a
board
and
constitutionally
made
up.
it
was
a
board
because
it
is
unconstitutional
character.
it
was
unable
to
function
as
a
system
once
says
that
it
has
to
function
in
this
case.
it
was
--
it's
clear
from
the
results
that
the
board
achieved
in
this
case
that
it
was
not
the
kind
of
board
that
we
ought
to
have
sitting
on
these
kind
of
cases.
that
the
system
had
somehow
already
been
mismanaged
and
that
the
result
is
what
you
might
expect,
a
perfectly
valid
hardship
deferment
by
staff
and
a
young
man
being
sent
to
five
years
in
jail.
that
to
me,
is
indicative
of
what
happens
when
the
constitutional
structures
are
ignored
in
the
composition
of
these
board.
no
governor
of
the
state
of
louisiana
and
there
was
25
years
as
ever
recommend
a
negro
to
serve
on
any
of
these
boards
and
we
all
know
it.
judge
christenberry
who
tried
this
case
he
knew.
he
knew
the
board
was
all
white,
he
said
so
and
it
would
have
been
able
to
get
more
records
because
it
could
have
gone
further
back
in
five
years.
that's
all
the
records
they
had
available
to
him.
so
i
say
to
the
court,
we
can't
waive
something
we
don't
know
about
and
we
can't
waive
something
that
is
constitutional
and
we
cant
be
held
to
be
able
to
be
put
in
jail
by
these
kind
of
boards
when
we're
raising
constitutional
issues
and
the
court
below
has
simply
say,
“well,
if
you
don't
dot
every
eye
and
cross
everything,
and
be
very
technical
with
the
way
you
handle
yourself
before
these
boards,
they
you're
going
to
go
jail
and
you're
going
to
go
to
jail
even
though
that
board
is.
no
more
competent
that's
in
that
board
to
the
army
and
it
would
beat
us
this
court
somewhere.
just
an
incompetent
board
in
kind
and
they
expect
him
--
in
the
government's
brief
they
say,
he's
suppose
to
read
all
these
regulations.
he's
supposed
to
read
the
code
of
federal
regulations
which
says,
you
know,
certain
things
about
the
way
he's
suppose
to
handle
his
hardships.
for
he's
suppose
to
tell
the
board
about
it
ten
days
after,
he
gets
the
jobs,
he's
suppose
to
tell
them.
if
you
didn't
tell
them
he
waives.
but
how
the
heck
is
he
going
to
1636?
well,
it's
ten
days
with
paycheck,
ten
days
where
he
gives
his
money
to
his
mother.
he
comes,
go
--
he
goes
in
there
and
tells
the
board
about
it
but
what
does
he
get?
he
gets
this
kind
of
a
board
giving
him
a
fast
shuffle
and
that's
what
he
got.
so,
i
respectfully
submit
to
the
court
that
we
can't
be
held
the
way
of
the
constitutional
issues.
this
man
has
got
to
be
given
his
day
in
court
and
he's
going
to
be
able
to
get
up
and
tell
that
jury.
look,
this
is
--
or
tell
that
judge
effectively.
look,
this
is
a
bad
board.
it's
a
really
white
board.
it's
doesn't
understand
many
premise.
incompetent
to
sit
on
my
case.
it's
got
a
bad
chairman
and
they
can't
deny
it
in
appeal.
he
can't
waive
those
kinds
of
issues.
i
don't
think
--
it's
unconscionable
for
a
system
to
say
to
this
man,
“you're
going
to
jail
and
you're
going
to
jail
and
you
can't
raise
constitutional
issues
about
it.”
he's
going
to
go
now
and
he's
going
to
now
for
five
years.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
a
de
novo
proceeding,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
so
you
have
more
--
you
mean,
in
such
proceedings,
they'll
take
all
kinds
of
evidence?
justice
potter
stewart
this
might
what
you
can't
tell
because
it's
ambiguous
but
this
might
well
have
been
a
change
for
reasons
beyond
his
control,
i.e.,
he
was
called
to
attend
the
police
academy.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
don't
know
the
man,
we
just
can't
tell
from
this
footnote.
justice
potter
stewart
members
of
the
local
selective

boards
are
in
all
cases
appointed
by
the
president
of
the
united
states
on
the
advice
of
the
governor
on
respective
states.
justice
potter
stewart
no
other
way
that
they
become
members?
justice
potter
stewart
and
is
this
also
true
to
the
appeals
board,
the
state
appeals
board?
justice
potter
stewart
recommended
by
the
governor,
appointed
by
the
president
of
