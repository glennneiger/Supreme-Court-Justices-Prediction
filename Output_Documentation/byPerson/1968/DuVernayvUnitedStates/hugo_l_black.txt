justice
hugo
l.
black
well
would
it
--
could
the
board
be
removed
by
quo
warranto
proceeding?
justice
hugo
l.
black
could
the
board
be
removed
by
quo
warranto
proceeding?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
trying
to
say,
they
are
wholly
void
--
wholly
void
board?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
a
whole
illegal
board,
would
all
the
people
who
had
been
granted
in
the
army
be
illegally
in
the
army?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
was
he
appointed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
by
the
president.
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
that
specifically
answers
this
contention
by
this
question.
what
he
says
is
that
the
board
was
not
a
valid
board.
it
wasn't
a
valid
board
as
i
understand
it
when
it
classified
him,
it
wasn't
a
valid
board
there
and
i'm
not
indicating
any
belief
about
whether
he
was
right
but
he
can
raise
it
this
way
but
if
he
can
raise
it
at
all,
what
difference
does
it
make?
it
is
invalid
board
and
the
regulation,
he
must
present
something
to
it
in
order
to
raise
it
at
a
particular
time.
how
does
that
escape
the
question
he
has
presented
too?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
his
contention
is
the
board
was
improperly
classified
by
an
illegal
board
and
therefore
he
hadn't
been
classified
at
all
and
there's
no
basis
for
ordering
him
to
present
himself.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
he
says
that
he
was
ordered
by
a
board
that
was
no
board
because
he
treats
it.
since
he
said
there
has
been
negroes
on
it
at
all
as
an
invalid
board
and
one
which
can't
enter
it
all.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
might
be
true
but
don't
you
have
to
get
to
his
issues,
how
can
we
decide
the
case
without
getting
to
his
issues.
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
does
he
raise
his
constitutional
question
on
all
the
premises
as
you're
suggesting
to
the
court.
how
does
he
raise
his
constitutional
ground?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
about
in
the
north?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
our
--
let's
assume
that
where
everything
he
say
is
true,
that
there
has
been
none,
not
one
man,
what
is
the
proper
remedy
to
raise
that
question?
can
you
do
it
in
a
criminal
case
or
do
you
have
to
treat
that
board
as
wholly
void?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
just
a
basic
question.
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
other
words
you
think
it's
the
same
as
the
--
as
though
they
have
been
elected
that
way?
justice
hugo
l.
black
or
appointed,
legally
appointed,
legally
appointed
or
elected
except
to
resolve
his
new
(inaudible)
to
a
point
in
a
colloquy,
what
would
you
do?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
you
would
have
to
treat
him
as
a
de
facto
also?
you
think
it
could
be
raised
by
this
method?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
suppose
it
is
shown.
let's
assume
that
it's
shown.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
i'm
saying
that
is
does
the
government
admit
that
this
question
can
be
raised
by
taxing
the
board
out
right
and
saying,
“we'll
not
consider
any
of
their
action
or
should
that
be
raised
in
some
other
fashion.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
in
other
words,
you
say
that
--
you
say
that
if
there's
a
defect
in
the
classification,
it's
wrong,
that
it
can
be
raised.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
why
that
couldn't
be
done
in
reference
to
all
officers
appointed
by
the
president?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
saying
that
a
(inaudible)
appointment
is
valid?
justice
hugo
l.
black
even
he's
there.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yeah
and
it
has
made
some
kind
of
an
legal
error,
the
court
can
revise
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
argue
--
i'm
not
saying
either
that
we
got
--
that
is
to
be
raised
in
connection
whoever
appointee
by
the
president.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
would
it
--
could
the
board
be
removed
by
quo

proceeding?
justice
hugo
l.
black
could
the
board
be

by

you
