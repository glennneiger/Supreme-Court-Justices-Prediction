justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
it
your
position
about
the
statute
that
if
these
are
the
changed
circumstances
on
which
petitioner
relies,
they're
not
available
to
or
on
april
13th
because
its
only
circumstances,
changes
in
circumstances
which
occurred
after
that
date
over
which
he
had
no
control
of
which
would
permit
the
board
to
do
anything
at
all
about
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
gather
your
point
is
that
at
that
juncture,
the
board
would
have
had
the
authority
of
power
jurisdiction
which
he
will
do
something
about.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
after
april
13,
they
had
no
authority
power
or
whatever
to
do
anything
as
to
circumstances
which
develop
before.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
martin
you
said
before
us
that
many
event,
that
was
the
claim
that
was
taken
in
the
first
instance
to
appeal
board
and
then
the
national
board.
now,
how
do
you
answer
mr.
smith's
suggestion,
how
could
we
at
that
tine,
we
didn't
know
the
facts,
we
didn't
discover
the
facts
until
at
the
time
of
the
criminal
trial.
how
do
you
--
how
do
you
answer
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
shouldn't
it
need
much
to
prove
that
if
you
had
a
chairman
who
was
a
member
of
the
ku
klux
klan
would
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what's
evident
as
i
understand
it
that
the
police
officers,
white
police
officers,
after
they
got
notices
of
induction
had
no
difficulty
getting
there
and
getting
postponements
which
were
tantamount
to
as
i
understand
it,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
when
you
read
that
as
an
official
action
of
the
board
not
on
a
finding
that
something
that
happened
after
the
notice
of
induction
went
out
and
that's
something
being
something
beyond
the
control
of
the
registrant
but
they
just
acted
on
the
request
and
deferred
him
themselves,
asking
the
state
director
to
cancel
the
induction
but
the
action
you're
telling
is,
was
the
action
of
the
board,
is
that
it?
