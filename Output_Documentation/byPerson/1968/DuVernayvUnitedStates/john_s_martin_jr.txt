mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
find
myself
in
somewhat
of
a
wondering
the
way
to
approach
the
argument
in
this
case
because
it
seems
to
me
that
petitioner
has
ignored
what
is
really
crucial
to
the
case
that
is
before
this
court
and
that
is
the
vital
role
that
is
played
in
the
selective
service
system
by
the
provision
embodied
in
the
regulations
that
once
a
notice
of
induction
is
sent
to
a
registrant,
the
local
board
is
precluded
from
reviewing
that
registrant's
classification
unless
it
finds
that
there
has
been
a
change
in
circumstances
since
the
time
that
notice
was
mailed?
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
unless
there
has
been
a
change
in
the
registrant's
circumstance.
to
review
briefly
the
facts
here,
a
petitioner
who
had
been
a
student,
dropped
out
of
school
in
december
of
1965.
on
january
19th,
1966,
he
was
reclassified
1-a.
on
january
28th,
1966,
he
was
ordered
to
report
of
physical
examination.
on
february
23rd,
he
did
not
appear
on
that
date
because
he
says
that
he
overslept.
the
physical
was
rescheduled
for
a
date
of
march
14th.
he
appeared
on
that
date
and
was
found
physically
accepted
--
acceptable
for
service
and
was
then
on
april
13th,
1966
ordered
to
report
for
induction
on
may
20th.
our
petitioner
contends
and
here
that
as
of
january
19th,
1966,
the
date
he
was
classified
1-a,
there
was
no
other
classification
in
which
he
could
be
put.
he
says
that
he
wasn't
working,
the
record
is
not
clear
on
that.
he
started
to
work
some
time
in
january
according
to
the
record
but
the
exact
date
was
never
clarified.
the
petitioner's
position
is
that
that
classification
was
correct.
i
would
clarify
one
point
here
that
that
is
the
only
time
as
far
as
we
know
that
anything
in
the
record
that
mr.
helm
was
the
man
that
they
claim
as
the
clansman
that
had
any
connection
with
the
case.
all
the
minutes
of
board
meetings
after
that
date
indicate
that
he
was
not
present
and
it
had
been
our
assumption
that
he
had
gone
off
the
board
in
some
intervening
time.
but
in
any
event,
petitioner
says
that
january
classification
is
correct.
so
therefore,
the
time
the
board
issued
its
notice
to
report
for
induction
april
13th
and
all
the
information
before
it.
the
petitioner
was
rightfully
classified
1-a
and
he
was
therefore
physically
--
found
physically
acceptable
and
he
was
therefore
a
proper
person
to
be
ordered
to
report
for
induction.
and
he
was
so
ordered.
all
of
the
information
which
the
petitioner
now
contends
show
that
he
was
entitled
to
a
deferment
here
because
of
the
hardship
that
would
be
involved
to
his
mother
and
brothers
and
sisters
by
his
induction
or
because
of
his
occupation.
none
of
the
these
information
was
brought
to
the
board's
attention
prior
to
the
time
that
notice
to
report
for
induction
was
sent
although
petitioner
can
see
that
at
the
trial
and
i
think
concedes
here
that
these
facts
did
exist
prior
to
the
time.
the
notice
to
report
for
induction
was
sent.
so
that
it
is
clear,
we
have
here
a
situation
which
totally
fits
with
any
exact
provision
of
1625.2
whether
it
has
not
been
the
change
in
circumstances
of
the
registrant,
subsequent
to
the
mailing
of
the
notice
to
report
for
induction
and
therefore
the
board
is
precluded
by
the
regulations
from
reopening
the
classification.
it
is
the
government's
contention
here
that
petitioner's
failure
to
bring
to
the
court's
attention
the
fact
relating
to
his
hardship
claim
or
his
claim
to
an
occupational
deferment
at
a
time
when
the
board
could
have
conceded
the
merits
of
those
claims
was
in
fact
a
failure
to
exhaust
his
administrative
remedies
which
therefore
precluded
the
courts
from
passing
on
the
validity
of
his
classification
at
the
time
he
was
ordered
to
report
for
induction
and
the
time
he
failed
to
submit
to
induction.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
he
alleges
no
change.
he
concedes
that
there
was
no
change
after
he
received
his
notice
to
report
for
induction.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
he
said
that
the
change
occurred
between
january
19th,
1966,
the
day
he
was
classified
1-a
and
april
13th,
1966,
the
day
the
board
issued
its
order
to
report
for
induction
but
at
no
time
during
that
period
when
this
change
occurred
according
to
petitioner
did
petitioner
go
to
the
board
and
said
there
has
been
a
change
in
my
circumstances
that
classification
which
you
gave
me
1-a
was
right
at
the
time
but
now
there
are
other
factors
which
i
think
show
that
i'm
entitled
to
a
either
hardship
or
occupational
deferment.
had
he
done
so,
the
board
under
the
regulations
could
have
considered
the
facts
and
if
they
found
that
the
facts
if
true
would
warrant
the
classification
which
he
was
suggesting
he's
entitled
to.
if
they
said
that
on
the
facts
you
present,
if
they're
true,
there
would
be
a
hardship,
we
could
give
you
that
classification.
then
the
board
could
have
reopened
his
classification
considered
the
facts,
made
his
investigation
and
i
think
it's
important
here
to
point
out
that
if
the
board
was
considering
that
classification,
they
would
have
it
available
to
them,
several
things
that
he
could
have
done,
not
only
they
could
they
examine
the
petitioner
and
his
mother
but
they
could
have
consulted
local
welfare
agencies
to
determine
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that's
right.
what
i'm
saying
that's
right.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that
is
correct.
that
is
our
position.
that's
what
the
regulation
has
embodied.
and
what
i'm
saying
here
simply
is
that
if
before
the
time
of
the
notice
to
report
for
induction.
he
informed
the
board
for
these
changes
as
they
may
have.
they
could
have
taken
some
action,
they
could
have
investigated
the
claim,
they
could
have
go
to
welfare
agencies
in
the
area
to
give
some
indication
of
what
support
there
would
be
for
the
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
and
that
is
the
basic
position
that
we're
urging
that
once
that
notice
to
report
for
induction
came.
1-a
classification
was
proper
and
there
was
no
basis
on
which
it
could
have
been
challenged.
that
therefore,
the
court
below
was
right.
there
had
been
a
failure
to
exhaust
these
administrative
remedies
by
not
bringing
to
the
local
board's
attention
in
its
seizable
--
at
a
seizeable
time,
those
factors
which
he
claimed
authorize
a
change
in
its
classification.
i
think
that
this
regulation
is
an
important
vital
that's
within
the
framework
of
the
selective
service
system.
i
think
it
embodies
a
principle
that
the
necessity
which
is
self-evident
that
there
has
to
come
a
time
in
the
selective
service
system
when
those
who
were
charged
with
meeting
draft
boarders
on
a
month-to-month
basis,
can
no
with
assurance
that
a
classification
is
final
and
that
a
person
classified
at
1-a
at
that
particular
time
will
in
fact
be
available
to
report
for
induction
on
the
day
schedule
that
he's
mailed
the
notice
to
report
for
induction.
it
seems
evident
if
the
local
board
has
to
have
a
100
men
to
report
to
induction
on
may
20th.
they
have
to
go
through
all
these,
find
those
people
classified
1-a,
look
at
their
file
and
make
sure
that
that
classification
is
proper
and
then
send
to
those
100
people
a
notice
to
report
for
induction.
if
after
that
notice,
to
report
for
induction
is
sent,
those
100
people
could
each
come
in
and
say
now,
“wait
a
minute,
there
are
other
claims
i
want
to
make
as
to
my
classification.
i
want
a
deferment
for
hardship
because
my
occupation.”
then
the
board
will
have
no
way
of
guaranteeing
that
it
wouldn't
meet
its
commitment
to
the
military
service
of
this
country
to
provide
100
men
to
be
inducted
and
i
think
this
is
why
this
regulation
is
vital
and
it
is
why
i
think
it
is
a
reasonable
regulation
within
the
selective
service
system.
i
think
it
is
also
interesting
to
note
that
this
cut-off
date
is
not
only
of
the
time
a
notice
to
report
for
induction
is
sent.
it's
one
that
is
not
only
embodied
in
the
regulations
but
it's
one
that
congress
itself
recognized
in
enacting
the
statute.
it
provided
that
it
section
6(a)
of
the
act,
that
any
person
who
prior
to
the
issuance
of
orders
for
him
to
report
for
induction,
enlists
or
accepts
appointment
in
the
ready
reserve
shall
be
deferred.
congress
recognized
with
respect
to
reservist
also.
yes,
there
is
an
interest
in
deferring
reservist
but
there
has
to
come
a
time
when
the
classification
is
final
and
people
can
be
bordered
up
and
expected
to
report
and
they
as
the
--
congress
and
the
statute
as
in
the
regulations
set
that
time
as
when
the
notice
to
report
for
induction
is
mailed
to
the
registrant.
so
i
think
that
if
that
registrant
--
if
that
regulation
is
as
we
submit
a
constitutional
one,
authorized
by
the
statute,
then
the
local
board
at
the
time
mr.
duvernay
came
to
present
his
claims
was
precluded
from
acting
on
those
claims
and
therefore
he
cannot
now
contend
that
the
action
of
the
board
in
denying
those
claims
was
improper.
it
was
in
fact
proper.
it
had
a
basis
in
fact.
his
classification
was
based
on
the
facts
as
of
the
time
the
notice
to
report
for
induction
was
sent
to
him
and
the
board
acting
pursuant
to
the
regulation,
could
do
nothing
else
but
maintain
that
classification.
now
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
think
that
he'd
come
in
anytime
prior
to
the
time
he
was
noted,
he
was
sent
his
notice
to
report
for
induction,
the
board
could
have
considered
the
claim.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
he
was
set
the
notice
to
report
for
induction
april
13th,.
he
was
classified
1-a
on
january
19th.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
he
was
sent
the
notice
to
report
on
april
13.
i
think
anywhere,
anytime
within
those
two
dates
had
he
commend
the
board
would
have
had
power
to
consider
his
claim.
i
think
it
should
be
pointed
out
that
the
regulations
provide
and
in
fact
it
appears
on
the
back
of
the
classification
card
which
the
registrant
has
sent.
every
registrant
when
he's
classified
receives
a
time,
this
is
the
time
the
petitioner
was
classified.
he
received
a
card
like
this
which
is
the
classifications
that
we
got
here.
and
right
on
the
back
of
the
classification
is
printed
the
notice
that
you
are
required
to
have
this
notice
on
your
possession
and
the
card
says,
i'm
quoting,
“the
law
requires
you
to
notify
your
local
board
in
writing
of
every
change
in
your
address,
physical
condition,
occupational,
marital,
family
dependency,
and
military
status
and
of
any
other
fact
which
might
change
your
classification
within
ten
days
after
it
occurs.”
so
that
petitioner
was
under
an
obligation
under
the
selective
service
regulations
to
report
to
his
local
board
these
changes
which
he
now
claims
made
him
eligible
for
deferment.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think
mr.
justice,
it
operates
in
this
way.
his
basic
contention
is
that
i
was
improperly
classified.
he
says,
i
was
improperly
classified
because
of
--
because
of
the
racial
composition
of
the
board.
what
we're
saying
first
is
that
let
us
assume
that
he
is
correct,
that
he
was
improperly
classified,
that
the
board
was,
i'm
--
i
strike
improperly
classified.
let
us
assume
that
he's
right.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
what
i'm
saying
response
there's
two
things.
one
that,
if
we
accepted
the
board
was
improperly
constituted
that
is
the
negroes
were
excluded
for
the
purpose
of
argument.
still,
there
is
patent
on
this
record,
the
fact
that
there
was
no
improper
classification
because
he
concedes
that
he
was
properly
classified
1-a.
he
concedes
the
fact
getting
rise
to
his
claim
of
deferment
occurred
prior
to
the
time
that
he
was
ordered
to
report
for
induction
and
under
the
regulations,
once
he
was
ordered
to
report
for
induction,
there
was
nothing
the
board
could
do,
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
don't
think
that
that
necessarily
would
follow.
i
think
that
for
example
a
doubt
that
if
a
white
man
were
classified
by
this
board,
the
court
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think
there
is
one
way
you
could
do
--
one
way
you
can
do
it
is
to
look
to
see
is
there
any
possibility
that
the
racial
composition
of
this
board
could
have
affected
his
classification
and
we
submit
that
on
the
facts
presented
by
the
record,
there
was
no
way.
but
he
wasn't
allowed
to
present
his
proof.
well,
he
was
not.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
he
was
allowed.
there
was
no
--
the
only
area
of
proof
on
which
he
was
at
all
excluded
was
his
offered
proof
that
the
particular
member
of
the
board
was
a
member
of
the
clan
and
that
was
cut
off
by
objection
which
was
sustained.
as
i
say,
that
was
the
only
think
in
the
record.
the
record
is
clear.
it
was
stated
in
various
meetings.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
think
we
would
contend
that
by
failing
to
proceed
through
the
appeal
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that's
right
because
the
appeal
--
basically
which
claimed
here
somehow
that
my
classification
is
wrong
and
that
he'd
be
taken
the
case
to
a
higher
board
and
then
that
board
could
by
a
change
of
classification.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that's
correct,
that
he
could
go
a
step
higher
if
he
properly
pursued
his
remedies.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that's
correct
but
i
think
this
brings
into
play
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that's
true.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
courts
should
not
have
considered
that
claim
on
the
merits.
and
i
think
our
answers
to
that
are
two-fold.
one,
i
think
what
we're
saying
in
the
first
instance
is
that
this
was
the
board
that
carry
not
looking
to
the
racial
composition.
it
was
a
duly
appointed
board,
appointed
according
to
the
procedure
set
forth
in
the
statute
and
regulation.
it
was
acted
and
i
think
it
will
be
our
submission
on
this
point
that
in
order
for
the
action
of
that
board
to
be
held
invalid
because
of
possible
racial
discrimination,
there
would
have
to
be
some
indication
at
least
a
suggestion
that
the
board's
action
could
have
been
improperly
motivated.
and
that
that
does
not
appear
in
this
record.
it
is
conceded
that
the
classification
was
proper
and
it
has
conceded
the
facts
weren't
brought
to
the
board's
attention
when
they
should
have
been
under
the
regulation
nothing
more
could
have
been
done
by
the
local
board
after
it
sent
out
the
notice
to
report
for
induction.
so
that
in
effect,
it
is
clear
on
this
record
that
racial
consideration
could
have
had
no
effect
upon
this
classification
and
that
is
the
point
that
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
no
i
don't
think
--
that
is
not
true.
the
only
thing
at
all
in
this
record
whether
(inaudible)
was
in
showing
that
the
member
of
the
board
and
the
only
question
is
was
at
the
time
petitioner
was
classified
1-a
was
in
the
head
of
the
board
a
member
of
the
ku
klux
klan
objection
sustained.
that
is
the
only
question
asked
in
which
there
was
any
cutting
off.
so
all
you
have
is
the
cutting
off
of
the
fact
that
the
time
this
man
was
classified
1-a.
a
classification
which
he
concedes
and
argues
in
fact
is
the
only
one
he
could
have
obtain
that
was
a
member
on
the
member
who
was
a
member
of
the
ku
klux
klan.
so
i
think
it's
apparent
that
even
if
that's
true,
that
petitioner's
classification
at
that
time
could
not
have
been
affected
by
racial
considerations
because
he
concedes
there
was
no
other
classification
in
which
he
could
have
been
put.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think
the
basic
answer
to
that
claim
is
what
i
am
suggesting
is
there
has
to
be
for
this
any
aspect
of
racial
discrimination
to
come
into
play,
some
basis
for
suggesting
that
the
classification
could
have
been
affected
by
the
racial
composition
of
the
board.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think
you
would
need
to
show
that
it
affected
this
particular
registrant.
i
think
it
would
be
clear
to
mr.
justice
brennan
for
example
that
if
a
white
man
had
appeared
before
this
court,
was
denied
a
deferment.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
there
was
one
instance
in
which
the
board
in
the
minutes
which
reflected
the
fact
that
the
board,
a
police
department
made
a
request
to
the
board
that
it
defer
for
occupational
grounds
a
man
who
had
been
ordered
to
report
for
induction.
what
the
board
did
in
that
case,
was
to
say
that
they
could
not
reopen
but
they
sent
a
letter
to
the
state
director
who
does
have
the
power
the
classification
anytime,
asking
that
helm,
addressing
to
helm
that
he
might
want
to
exercise
his
authority
to
open
anytime
the
classification
so
this
could
be
considered.
that
is
what
was
done,
it
would
deny
itself
to
reopen
it.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
they
could
have
done
that
with
this
man,
this
man
could
have
done
it
himself
though.
i
think
it
really
doesn't
make
a
great
deal
of
difference.
there's
no
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think
there
are
couple
of
things
to
be
said
in
answer
to
that.
i
think
the
first
thing
that
has
to
be
said
is
really
is
the
base
of
his
whole
claim.
there
just
is
no
record
supporting
the
statements
that
the
counsels
made
that
they
were
for
all
times
discrimination
against
negroes
throughout
the
state.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
don't.
it
may
be,
i
just
don't
--
i
don't
know
the
facts.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
all
i
know
mr.
chief
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
did
not
find
out
exactly
what
the
racial
composition
of
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
but
whether
the
--
yeah,
what
the
composition
was,
no
we
did
not.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i'm
sure
there's
common
knowledge
that
there
have
been
you
know,
discrimination
in
south
that
is
being
practiced
by
government
officials
and
practiced
by
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
think,
you
know,
i
think
that
there
has
been
throughout
and
it's
unfortunate
that
that
is
so
by
do
thinking
in
the
sense
the
selective
service
system
has
these
some
extent
an
ability
to
deal
with
question.
it
does
seem
to
me
in
one
sense
and
this
i
think
leads
to
something
else.
he
said
how
did
anybody
know
that
when
the
board
--
you
know
people
on
the
board
--
well,
you
take
your
assumption
mr.
chief
justice
that
this
is
common
knowledge
that
white
government
officials
do
not
recommend
for
appointment
in
the
south.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
think
what
you
can
say
is
that,
one,
he's
somehow
to
be
affected
by
this,
that
he's
has
to
be
misclassified
in
some
way.
it
seems
to
me,
a
negro
knew
he's
no
different
from
a
white
man
of
the
situation
that
if
he
goes
to
a
particular
board
and
he's
properly
classified.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think
there
are
differences,
yes.
a
negro
will
be
greatly
affected
if
he
has
a
valid
claim
for
deferment
which
he
presents
at
a
proper
time
and
the
board
doesn't
grant
him
his
deferment
because
they
are
racially
motivated
but
i
think
that
there
has
to
be
and
this
is
what
i
was
saying
that
a
negro
was
no
different
from
the
white
man
in
the
situation
who
is
properly
classified,
there's
no
reason
to
change
his
classification
and
is
then
ordered
to
report
for
induction,
that
both
the
white
man,
the
negro
in
the
same
situation
have
not
been
prejudiced.
there's
been
no
racial
discrimination
enacted
against
them.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
mr.
chief
justice,
there
at
least
in
the
record
some
facts
that
indicate
here
why
perhaps
the
board
did
not
feel
it
appropriate
to
take
the
steps
with
regard
to
this
registrant.
that
is
--
although
his
claim
was
for
hardship,
that
was
not
the
first
claim
he
made
after
he
came
in.
he
made
a
claim
which
seems
to
me
to
refute
his
hardship
claim
when
he
first
--
after
he
received
the
notice
to
report
for
induction.
he
came
in
two
days
later
with
a
notice
to
report
for
induction
in
his
hand
and
he
said,
i
want
a
student
deferment.
i'm
going
back
to
school
in
the
fourth.
i
just
dropped
out
but
i'm
going
back
to
school.
now,
i
think
this
indicates
that
his
intention
that
time
was
not
to
continue
support
his
mother
and
the
children.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think
basically,
they
don't
have
under
the
regulations
--
they
don't
have
the
power.
only,
what
they
could
do
is
what
he
could
do
for
himself.
they
could
ask
the
state
director
to
reopen
his
classification.
i
think
that
that
is
something
that
he
could
have
done
for
himself.
that
he
was
improperly
classified.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
think
the
government's
position
would
have
been
mr.
justice
that
unless
there
was
some
reason
to
find
a
possibility
of
prejudice.
let
us
assume
for
example
a
negro
registrant
who
comes
in
and
says
he's
improperly
classified
1-a.
he
should
clearly
be
entitled
let
us
say
to
a
student
deferment.
i
think
there,
you
may
say,
alright,
you
can't
hold
it
against
him
that
he
didn't
know
that
negroes
were
excluded
from
his
board.
but
i
think
you
still
have
to
go
to
step
further
and
say,
but
doesn't
he
in
any
event
eventhough
he
doesn't
know
why
he
was
improperly
classified
does
and
if
he
is
claiming
and
the
claim
is
still
basically
an
improper
classification
have
to
resort
to
the
machinery
which
the
selective
service
statute
and
regulation
sets
up
to
correct
improper
classifications.
he
can
take
that
to
an
appeal
board
and
if
they
are
unsuccessful
--
if
he's
unsuccessful
there,
he
can
either
if
it's
a
split
decision
taken
to
the
presidential
appeal
board,
or
either
the
state
director
or
national
director
can
take
that
decision
to
the
presidential
appeal
board.
i
think
this
is
something
that
is
important
also
to
consider
that
let
us
assume
for
a
minute
a
man
who
was
improperly
classified
who
knows
that
a
negro
--
who
knows
that
a
negro
has
been
excluded
from
his
board,
what
can
he
do?
counsel
said
and
we
agree
that
perhaps
the
constitutional
question
could
not
be
decided
by
the
appeal
board
but
what
could
be
done
is
the
classification
cold
be
decided
and
if
the
appellant
in
his
statement
said,
“i
was
classified
1-a
when
i
should
have
been
2-s
and
the
reason
i
was
classified
was
because
the
local
board
was
prejudiced
against
me
because
i
was
a
negro.”
that
fact
have
as
to
the
reason
for
misclassification
can
be
brought
to
the
appeal
board's
attention.
so
that
they
will
focus
on
the
classification
and
realize
that
there
is
this
possibility
that
they
have
to
carefully
scrutinize
the
case
to
determine
whether
or
not
1-a
is
the
proper
classification
for
this
registrant.
so
i
think
that
there
are
in
the
system
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
yes,
that
is
a
de
novo
proceeding.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
they
can
--
no,
i'm
sorry.
they
are
bound
by
the
record
over
we
can
make
a
statement
that
accompanies
the
record
and
that
is
important,
the
facts
that
they
can
consider.
but
i
certainly
think
that
it
is
--
and
basically
all
they
have
to
find
is
the
prima
facie
case
has
been
made
out
before
the
local
board.
if
he
alleges
that
the
reason
he
was
denied
is
application
was
that
the
board
were
just
prejudiced
against
him,
if
this
is
something
that
he
could
bring
to
the
appeal
boards
to
the
decision
and
they
can
take
into
their
mind
in
determining
whether
the
classification
is
proper.
i
think
that
is
basically
what
we're
talking
about.
is
this
man's
classification
proper
at
the
time
he's
ordered
to
report
for
induction?
and
if
it's
so,
it
seems
to
me,
it's
no
different
than
a
man
who
was
convicted
by
a
court
in
the
south
in
which
over
a
period
of
years
no
negroes
have
been
appointed
for
the
bench.
certainly
if
there's
anything
to
indicate.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
think
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
think
that
you
have
to
look
at
the
board
as
any
other
body
appointed
by
the
executive,
whether
it
be
the
court
or
the
administrative
agency.
i
think
it
have
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
think
that
you
still
in
that
type
of
situation
that
it
is
different
from
the
jury
which
by
constitution
is
required
to
represent
of
course
a
section
of
the
community.
i
think
that
it
is
a
different
situation
in
all
of
those
cases,
you
have
to
look
very
carefully
to
determine.
did
this
man
suffer
because
the
person
or
the
body
that
passed
on
his
application
if
it's
a
case
in
court
where
the
judge
has
acted
to
racial
motives.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
the
court
mean
that
the
board
is
a
de
facto
order,
is
a
de
facto
is
operating
and
i
think
what
has
to
be
shown
in
these
circumstances.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
no,
i
think
what
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
it
can
only
be
raised
upon
some
showing
that
there
was
in
fact
a
defect
in
the
classification.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
if
there's
a
defect
in
the
classification
and
the
question
is
to
the
propriety
of
that
classification
was
raised
properly
through
the
selective
service
system.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
think
that's
true.
i
think
that
the
same
the
booking
into
the
constitution,
the
acts
of
the
court,
that
are
pointed.
i
don't
think
you
look
to
see
whether
in
determining
a
racial
discrimination
problem,
you
don't
look
to
see
whether
or
not
the
president
has
ever
pointed
a
negro
to
a
particular
court.
you
have
to
look
and
see
had
the
judge
--
did
the
judge
in
this
court
act
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
he's
there.
he
didn't
act
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
absolutely.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
absolutely
not.
it's
exactly
what
i'm
saying
is
that
you
have
to
treat
the
people
that's
invalidly
there
which
you
do
try
and
determine
as
to
whether
or
not
they
had
acted
out
of
racial
motives
and
where
there's
no
evidence
as
to
why
they
acted
to
that
reason,
that
the
classification
is
valid.
and
also
that
when
there
is
an
improper
classification,
that
classification
has
to
be
brought
to
the
--
through
this
system
where
it
can
also
be
corrected
before
it
can
be
brought
into
court.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
find
myself
in
somewhat
of
a
wondering
the
way
to
approach
the
argument
in
this
case
because
it
seems
to
me
that
petitioner
has
ignored
what
is
really
crucial
to
the
case
that
is
before
this
court
and
that
is
the
vital
role
that
is
played
in
the
selective
service
system
by
the
provision
embodied
in
the
regulations
that
once
a
notice
of
induction
is
sent
to
a
registrant,
the
local
board
is
precluded
from
reviewing
that
registrant's
classification
unless
it
finds
that
there
has
been
a
change
in
circumstances
since
the
time
that
notice
was
mailed?
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
unless
there
has
been
a
change
in
the
registrant's
circumstance.
to
review
briefly
the
facts
here,
a
petitioner
who
had
been
a
student,
dropped
out
of
school
in
december
of
1965.
on
january
19th,
1966,
he
was
reclassified
1-a.
on
january
28th,
1966,
he
was
ordered
to
report
of
physical
examination.
on
february
23rd,
he
did
not
appear
on
that
date
because
he
says
that
he
overslept.
the
physical
was
rescheduled
for
a
date
of
march
14th.
he
appeared
on
that
date
and
was
found
physically
accepted
--
acceptable
for
service
and
was
then
on
april
13th,
1966
ordered
to
report
for
induction
on
may
20th.
our
petitioner
contends
and
here
that
as
of
january
19th,
1966,
the
date
he
was
classified
1-a,
there
was
no
other
classification
in
which
he
could
be
put.
he
says
that
he
wasn't
working,
the
record
is
not
clear
on
that.
he
started
to
work
some
time
in
january
according
to
the
record
but
the
exact
date
was
never
clarified.
the
petitioner's
position
is
that
that
classification
was
correct.
i
would
clarify
one
point
here
that
that
is
the
only
time
as
far
as
we
know
that
anything
in
the
record
that
mr.
helm
was
the
man
that
they
claim
as
the
clansman
that
had
any
connection
with
the
case.
all
the
minutes
of
board
meetings
after
that
date
indicate
that
he
was
not
present
and
it
had
been
our
assumption
that
he
had
gone
off
the
board
in
some
intervening
time.
but
in
any
event,
petitioner
says
that
january
classification
is
correct.
so
therefore,
the
time
the
board
issued
its
notice
to
report
for
induction
april
13th
and
all
the
information
before
it.
the
petitioner
was
rightfully
classified
1-a
and
he
was
therefore
physically
--
found
physically
acceptable
and
he
was
therefore
a
proper
person
to
be
ordered
to
report
for
induction.
and
he
was
so
ordered.
all
of
the
information
which
the
petitioner
now
contends
show
that
he
was
entitled
to
a
deferment
here
because
of
the
hardship
that
would
be
involved
to
his
mother
and
brothers
and
sisters
by
his
induction
or
because
of
his
occupation.
none
of
the
these
information
was
brought
to
the
board's
attention
prior
to
the
time
that
notice
to
report
for
induction
was
sent
although
petitioner
can
see
that
at
the
trial
and
i
think
concedes
here
that
these
facts
did
exist
prior
to
the
time.
the
notice
to
report
for
induction
was
sent.
so
that
it
is
clear,
we
have
here
a
situation
which
totally
fits
with
any
exact
provision
of
1625.2
whether
it
has
not
been
the
change
in
circumstances
of
the
registrant,
subsequent
to
the
mailing
of
the
notice
to
report
for
induction
and
therefore
the
board
is
precluded
by
the
regulations
from
reopening
the
classification.
it
is
the
government's
contention
here
that
petitioner's
failure
to
bring
to
the
court's
attention
the
fact
relating
to
his
hardship
claim
or
his
claim
to
an
occupational
deferment
at
a
time
when
the
board
could
have
conceded
the
merits
of
those
claims
was
in
fact
a
failure
to
exhaust
his
administrative
remedies
which
therefore
precluded
the
courts
from
passing
on
the
validity
of
his
classification
at
the
time
he
was
ordered
to
report
for
induction
and
the
time
he
failed
to
submit
to
induction.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
he
alleges
no
change.
he
concedes
that
there
was
no
change
after
he
received
his
notice
to
report
for
induction.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
he
said
that
the
change
occurred
between
january
19th,
1966,
the
day
he
was
classified
1-a
and
april
13th,
1966,
the
day
the
board
issued
its
order
to
report
for
induction
but
at
no
time
during
that
period
when
this
change
occurred
according
to
petitioner
did
petitioner
go
to
the
board
and
said
there
has
been
a
change
in
my
circumstances
that
classification
which
you
gave
me
1-a
was
right
at
the
time
but
now
there
are
other
factors
which
i
think
show
that
i'm
entitled
to
a
either
hardship
or
occupational
deferment.
had
he
done
so,
the
board
under
the
regulations
could
have
considered
the
facts
and
if
they
found
that
the
facts
if
true
would
warrant
the
classification
which
he
was
suggesting
he's
entitled
to.
if
they
said
that
on
the
facts
you
present,
if
they're
true,
there
would
be
a
hardship,
we
could
give
you
that
classification.
then
the
board
could
have
reopened
his
classification
considered
the
facts,
made
his
investigation
and
i
think
it's
important
here
to
point
out
that
if
the
board
was
considering
that
classification,
they
would
have
it
available
to
them,
several
things
that
he
could
have
done,
not
only
they
could
they
examine
the
petitioner
and
his
mother
but
they
could
have
consulted
local
welfare
agencies
to
determine
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that's
right.
what
i'm
saying
that's
right.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that
is
correct.
that
is
our
position.
that's
what
the
regulation
has
embodied.
and
what
i'm
saying
here
simply
is
that
if
before
the
time
of
the
notice
to
report
for
induction.
he
informed
the
board
for
these
changes
as
they
may
have.
they
could
have
taken
some
action,
they
could
have
investigated
the
claim,
they
could
have
go
to
welfare
agencies
in
the
area
to
give
some
indication
of
what
support
there
would
be
for
the
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
and
that
is
the
basic
position
that
we're
urging
that
once
that
notice
to
report
for
induction
came.
1-a
classification
was
proper
and
there
was
no
basis
on
which
it
could
have
been
challenged.
that
therefore,
the
court
below
was
right.
there
had
been
a
failure
to
exhaust
these
administrative
remedies
by
not
bringing
to
the
local
board's
attention
in
its
seizable
--
at
a
seizeable
time,
those
factors
which
he
claimed
authorize
a
change
in
its
classification.
i
think
that
this
regulation
is
an
important
vital
that's
within
the
framework
of
the
selective
service
system.
i
think
it
embodies
a
principle
that
the
necessity
which
is
self-evident
that
there
has
to
come
a
time
in
the
selective
service
system
when
those
who
were
charged
with
meeting
draft
boarders
on
a
month-to-month
basis,
can
no
with
assurance
that
a
classification
is
final
and
that
a
person
classified
at
1-a
at
that
particular
time
will
in
fact
be
available
to
report
for
induction
on
the
day
schedule
that
he's
mailed
the
notice
to
report
for
induction.
it
seems
evident
if
the
local
board
has
to
have
a
100
men
to
report
to
induction
on
may
20th.
they
have
to
go
through
all
these,
find
those
people
classified
1-a,
look
at
their
file
and
make
sure
that
that
classification
is
proper
and
then
send
to
those
100
people
a
notice
to
report
for
induction.
if
after
that
notice,
to
report
for
induction
is
sent,
those
100
people
could
each
come
in
and
say
now,
“wait
a
minute,
there
are
other
claims
i
want
to
make
as
to
my
classification.
i
want
a
deferment
for
hardship
because
my
occupation.”
then
the
board
will
have
no
way
of
guaranteeing
that
it
wouldn't
meet
its
commitment
to
the
military
service
of
this
country
to
provide
100
men
to
be
inducted
and
i
think
this
is
why
this
regulation
is
vital
and
it
is
why
i
think
it
is
a
reasonable
regulation
within
the
selective
service
system.
i
think
it
is
also
interesting
to
note
that
this
cut-off
date
is
not
only
of
the
time
a
notice
to
report
for
induction
is
sent.
it's
one
that
is
not
only
embodied
in
the
regulations
but
it's
one
that
congress
itself
recognized
in
enacting
the
statute.
it
provided
that
it
section
6(a)
of
the
act,
that
any
person
who
prior
to
the
issuance
of
orders
for
him
to
report
for
induction,
enlists
or
accepts
appointment
in
the
ready
reserve
shall
be
deferred.
congress
recognized
with
respect
to
reservist
also.
yes,
there
is
an
interest
in
deferring
reservist
but
there
has
to
come
a
time
when
the
classification
is
final
and
people
can
be
bordered
up
and
expected
to
report
and
they
as
the
--
congress
and
the
statute
as
in
the
regulations
set
that
time
as
when
the
notice
to
report
for
induction
is
mailed
to
the
registrant.
so
i
think
that
if
that
registrant
--
if
that
regulation
is
as
we
submit
a
constitutional
one,
authorized
by
the
statute,
then
the
local
board
at
the
time
mr.
duvernay
came
to
present
his
claims
was
precluded
from
acting
on
those
claims
and
therefore
he
cannot
now
contend
that
the
action
of
the
board
in
denying
those
claims
was
improper.
it
was
in
fact
proper.
it
had
a
basis
in
fact.
his
classification
was
based
on
the
facts
as
of
the
time
the
notice
to
report
for
induction
was
sent
to
him
and
the
board
acting
pursuant
to
the
regulation,
could
do
nothing
else
but
maintain
that
classification.
now
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
think
that
he'd
come
in
anytime
prior
to
the
time
he
was
noted,
he
was
sent
his
notice
to
report
for
induction,
the
board
could
have
considered
the
claim.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
he
was
set
the
notice
to
report
for
induction
april
13th,.
he
was
classified
1-a
on
january
19th.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
he
was
sent
the
notice
to
report
on
april
13.
i
think
anywhere,
anytime
within
those
two
dates
had
he
commend
the
board
would
have
had
power
to
consider
his
claim.
i
think
it
should
be
pointed
out
that
the
regulations
provide
and
in
fact
it
appears
on
the
back
of
the
classification
card
which
the
registrant
has
sent.
every
registrant
when
he's
classified
receives
a
time,
this
is
the
time
the
petitioner
was
classified.
he
received
a
card
like
this
which
is
the
classifications
that
we
got
here.
and
right
on
the
back
of
the
classification
is
printed
the
notice
that
you
are
required
to
have
this
notice
on
your
possession
and
the
card
says,
i'm
quoting,
“the
law
requires
you
to
notify
your
local
board
in
writing
of
every
change
in
your
address,
physical
condition,
occupational,
marital,
family
dependency,
and
military
status
and
of
any
other
fact
which
might
change
your
classification
within
ten
days
after
it
occurs.”
so
that
petitioner
was
under
an
obligation
under
the
selective
service
regulations
to
report
to
his
local
board
these
changes
which
he
now
claims
made
him
eligible
for
deferment.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think
mr.
justice,
it
operates
in
this
way.
his
basic
contention
is
that
i
was
improperly
classified.
he
says,
i
was
improperly
classified
because
of
--
because
of
the
racial
composition
of
the
board.
what
we're
saying
first
is
that
let
us
assume
that
he
is
correct,
that
he
was
improperly
classified,
that
the
board
was,
i'm
--
i
strike
improperly
classified.
let
us
assume
that
he's
right.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
what
i'm
saying
response
there's
two
things.
one
that,
if
we
accepted
the
board
was
improperly
constituted
that
is
the
negroes
were
excluded
for
the
purpose
of
argument.
still,
there
is
patent
on
this
record,
the
fact
that
there
was
no
improper
classification
because
he
concedes
that
he
was
properly
classified
1-a.
he
concedes
the
fact
getting
rise
to
his
claim
of
deferment
occurred
prior
to
the
time
that
he
was
ordered
to
report
for
induction
and
under
the
regulations,
once
he
was
ordered
to
report
for
induction,
there
was
nothing
the
board
could
do,
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
don't
think
that
that
necessarily
would
follow.
i
think
that
for
example
a
doubt
that
if
a
white
man
were
classified
by
this
board,
the
court
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think
there
is
one
way
you
could
do
--
one
way
you
can
do
it
is
to
look
to
see
is
there
any
possibility
that
the
racial
composition
of
this
board
could
have
affected
his
classification
and
we
submit
that
on
the
facts
presented
by
the
record,
there
was
no
way.
but
he
wasn't
allowed
to
present
his
proof.
well,
he
was
not.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
he
was
allowed.
there
was
no
--
the
only
area
of
proof
on
which
he
was
at
all
excluded
was
his
offered
proof
that
the
particular
member
of
the
board
was
a
member
of
the
clan
and
that
was
cut
off
by
objection
which
was
sustained.
as
i
say,
that
was
the
only
think
in
the
record.
the
record
is
clear.
it
was
stated
in
various
meetings.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
think
we
would
contend
that
by
failing
to
proceed
through
the
appeal
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that's
right
because
the
appeal
--
basically
which
claimed
here
somehow
that
my
classification
is
wrong
and
that
he'd
be
taken
the
case
to
a
higher
board
and
then
that
board
could
by
a
change
of
classification.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that's
correct,
that
he
could
go
a
step
higher
if
he
properly
pursued
his
remedies.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that's
correct
but
i
think
this
brings
into
play
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that's
true.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
courts
should
not
have
considered
that
claim
on
the
merits.
and
i
think
our
answers
to
that
are
two-fold.
one,
i
think
what
we're
saying
in
the
first
instance
is
that
this
was
the
board
that
carry
not
looking
to
the
racial
composition.
it
was
a
duly
appointed
board,
appointed
according
to
the
procedure
set
forth
in
the
statute
and
regulation.
it
was
acted
and
i
think
it
will
be
our
submission
on
this
point
that
in
order
for
the
action
of
that
board
to
be
held
invalid
because
of
possible
racial
discrimination,
there
would
have
to
be
some
indication
at
least
a
suggestion
that
the
board's
action
could
have
been
improperly
motivated.
and
that
that
does
not
appear
in
this
record.
it
is
conceded
that
the
classification
was
proper
and
it
has
conceded
the
facts
weren't
brought
to
the
board's
attention
when
they
should
have
been
under
the
regulation
nothing
more
could
have
been
done
by
the
local
board
after
it
sent
out
the
notice
to
report
for
induction.
so
that
in
effect,
it
is
clear
on
this
record
that
racial
consideration
could
have
had
no
effect
upon
this
classification
and
that
is
the
point
that
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
no
i
don't
think
--
that
is
not
true.
the
only
thing
at
all
in
this
record
whether
(inaudible)
was
in
showing
that
the
member
of
the
board
and
the
only
question
is
was
at
the
time
petitioner
was
classified
1-a
was
in
the
head
of
the
board
a
member
of
the
ku
klux
klan
objection
sustained.
that
is
the
only
question
asked
in
which
there
was
any
cutting
off.
so
all
you
have
is
the
cutting
off
of
the
fact
that
the
time
this
man
was
classified
1-a.
a
classification
which
he
concedes
and
argues
in
fact
is
the
only
one
he
could
have
obtain
that
was
a
member
on
the
member
who
was
a
member
of
the
ku
klux
klan.
so
i
think
it's
apparent
that
even
if
that's
true,
that
petitioner's
classification
at
that
time
could
not
have
been
affected
by
racial
considerations
because
he
concedes
there
was
no
other
classification
in
which
he
could
have
been
put.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think
the
basic
answer
to
that
claim
is
what
i
am
suggesting
is
there
has
to
be
for
this
any
aspect
of
racial
discrimination
to
come
into
play,
some
basis
for
suggesting
that
the
classification
could
have
been
affected
by
the
racial
composition
of
the
board.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think
you
would
need
to
show
that
it
affected
this
particular
registrant.
i
think
it
would
be
clear
to
mr.
justice
brennan
for
example
that
if
a
white
man
had
appeared
before
this
court,
was
denied
a
deferment.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
there
was
one
instance
in
which
the
board
in
the
minutes
which
reflected
the
fact
that
the
board,
a
police
department
made
a
request
to
the
board
that
it
defer
for
occupational
grounds
a
man
who
had
been
ordered
to
report
for
induction.
what
the
board
did
in
that
case,
was
to
say
that
they
could
not
reopen
but
they
sent
a
letter
to
the
state
director
who
does
have
the
power
the
classification
anytime,
asking
that
helm,
addressing
to
helm
that
he
might
want
to
exercise
his
authority
to
open
anytime
the
classification
so
this
could
be
considered.
that
is
what
was
done,
it
would
deny
itself
to
reopen
it.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
they
could
have
done
that
with
this
man,
this
man
could
have
done
it
himself
though.
i
think
it
really
doesn't
make
a
great
deal
of
difference.
there's
no
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think
there
are
couple
of
things
to
be
said
in
answer
to
that.
i
think
the
first
thing
that
has
to
be
said
is
really
is
the
base
of
his
whole
claim.
there
just
is
no
record
supporting
the
statements
that
the
counsels
made
that
they
were
for
all
times
discrimination
against
negroes
throughout
the
state.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
don't.
it
may
be,
i
just
don't
--
i
don't
know
the
facts.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
all
i
know
mr.
chief
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
did
not
find
out
exactly
what
the
racial
composition
of
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
but
whether
the
--
yeah,
what
the
composition
was,
no
we
did
not.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i'm
sure
there's
common
knowledge
that
there
have
been
you
know,
discrimination
in
south
that
is
being
practiced
by
government
officials
and
practiced
by
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
think,
you
know,
i
think
that
there
has
been
throughout
and
it's
unfortunate
that
that
is
so
by
do
thinking
in
the
sense
the
selective
service
system
has
these
some
extent
an
ability
to
deal
with
question.
it
does
seem
to
me
in
one
sense
and
this
i
think
leads
to
something
else.
he
said
how
did
anybody
know
that
when
the
board
--
you
know
people
on
the
board
--
well,
you
take
your
assumption
mr.
chief
justice
that
this
is
common
knowledge
that
white
government
officials
do
not
recommend
for
appointment
in
the
south.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
think
what
you
can
say
is
that,
one,
he's
somehow
to
be
affected
by
this,
that
he's
has
to
be
misclassified
in
some
way.
it
seems
to
me,
a
negro
knew
he's
no
different
from
a
white
man
of
the
situation
that
if
he
goes
to
a
particular
board
and
he's
properly
classified.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think
there
are
differences,
yes.
a
negro
will
be
greatly
affected
if
he
has
a
valid
claim
for
deferment
which
he
presents
at
a
proper
time
and
the
board
doesn't
grant
him
his
deferment
because
they
are
racially
motivated
but
i
think
that
there
has
to
be
and
this
is
what
i
was
saying
that
a
negro
was
no
different
from
the
white
man
in
the
situation
who
is
properly
classified,
there's
no
reason
to
change
his
classification
and
is
then
ordered
to
report
for
induction,
that
both
the
white
man,
the
negro
in
the
same
situation
have
not
been
prejudiced.
there's
been
no
racial
discrimination
enacted
against
them.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
mr.
chief
justice,
there
at
least
in
the
record
some
facts
that
indicate
here
why
perhaps
the
board
did
not
feel
it
appropriate
to
take
the
steps
with
regard
to
this
registrant.
that
is
--
although
his
claim
was
for
hardship,
that
was
not
the
first
claim
he
made
after
he
came
in.
he
made
a
claim
which
seems
to
me
to
refute
his
hardship
claim
when
he
first
--
after
he
received
the
notice
to
report
for
induction.
he
came
in
two
days
later
with
a
notice
to
report
for
induction
in
his
hand
and
he
said,
i
want
a
student
deferment.
i'm
going
back
to
school
in
the
fourth.
i
just
dropped
out
but
i'm
going
back
to
school.
now,
i
think
this
indicates
that
his
intention
that
time
was
not
to
continue
support
his
mother
and
the
children.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think
basically,
they
don't
have
under
the
regulations
--
they
don't
have
the
power.
only,
what
they
could
do
is
what
he
could
do
for
himself.
they
could
ask
the
state
director
to
reopen
his
classification.
i
think
that
that
is
something
that
he
could
have
done
for
himself.
that
he
was
improperly
classified.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
think
the
government's
position
would
have
been
mr.
justice
that
unless
there
was
some
reason
to
find
a
possibility
of
prejudice.
let
us
assume
for
example
a
negro
registrant
who
comes
in
and
says
he's
improperly
classified
1-a.
he
should
clearly
be
entitled
let
us
say
to
a
student
deferment.
i
think
there,
you
may
say,
alright,
you
can't
hold
it
against
him
that
he
didn't
know
that
negroes
were
excluded
from
his
board.
but
i
think
you
still
have
to
go
to
step
further
and
say,
but
doesn't
he
in
any
event
eventhough
he
doesn't
know
why
he
was
improperly
classified
does
and
if
he
is
claiming
and
the
claim
is
still
basically
an
improper
classification
have
to
resort
to
the
machinery
which
the
selective
service
statute
and
regulation
sets
up
to
correct
improper
classifications.
he
can
take
that
to
an
appeal
board
and
if
they
are
unsuccessful
--
if
he's
unsuccessful
there,
he
can
either
if
it's
a
split
decision
taken
to
the
presidential
appeal
board,
or
either
the
state
director
or
national
director
can
take
that
decision
to
the
presidential
appeal
board.
i
think
this
is
something
that
is
important
also
to
consider
that
let
us
assume
for
a
minute
a
man
who
was
improperly
classified
who
knows
that
a
negro
--
who
knows
that
a
negro
has
been
excluded
from
his
board,
what
can
he
do?
counsel
said
and
we
agree
that
perhaps
the
constitutional
question
could
not
be
decided
by
the
appeal
board
but
what
could
be
done
is
the
classification
cold
be
decided
and
if
the
appellant
in
his
statement
said,
“i
was
classified
1-a
when
i
should
have
been
2-s
and
the
reason
i
was
classified
was
because
the
local
board
was
prejudiced
against
me
because
i
was
a
negro.”
that
fact
have
as
to
the
reason
for
misclassification
can
be
brought
to
the
appeal
board's
attention.
so
that
they
will
focus
on
the
classification
and
realize
that
there
is
this
possibility
that
they
have
to
carefully
scrutinize
the
case
to
determine
whether
or
not
1-a
is
the
proper
classification
for
this
registrant.
so
i
think
that
there
are
in
the
system
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
yes,
that
is
a
de
novo
proceeding.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
they
can
--
no,
i'm
sorry.
they
are
bound
by
the
record
over
we
can
make
a
statement
that
accompanies
the
record
and
that
is
important,
the
facts
that
they
can
consider.
but
i
certainly
think
that
it
is
--
and
basically
all
they
have
to
find
is
the
prima
facie
case
has
been
made
out
before
the
local
board.
if
he
alleges
that
the
reason
he
was
denied
is
application
was
that
the
board
were
just
prejudiced
against
him,
if
this
is
something
that
he
could
bring
to
the
appeal
boards
to
the
decision
and
they
can
take
into
their
mind
in
determining
whether
the
classification
is
proper.
i
think
that
is
basically
what
we're
talking
about.
is
this
man's
classification
proper
at
the
time
he's
ordered
to
report
for
induction?
and
if
it's
so,
it
seems
to
me,
it's
no
different
than
a
man
who
was
convicted
by
a
court
in
the
south
in
which
over
a
period
of
years
no
negroes
have
been
appointed
for
the
bench.
certainly
if
there's
anything
to
indicate.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
think
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
think
that
you
have
to
look
at
the
board
as
any
other
body
appointed
by
the
executive,
whether
it
be
the
court
or
the
administrative
agency.
i
think
it
have
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
think
that
you
still
in
that
type
of
situation
that
it
is
different
from
the
jury
which
by
constitution
is
required
to
represent
of
course
a
section
of
the
community.
i
think
that
it
is
a
different
situation
in
all
of
those
cases,
you
have
to
look
very
carefully
to
determine.
did
this
man
suffer
because
the
person
or
the
body
that
passed
on
his
application
if
it's
a
case
in
court
where
the
judge
has
acted
to
racial
motives.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
the
court
mean
that
the
board
is
a
de
facto
order,
is
a
de
facto
is
operating
and
i
think
what
has
to
be
shown
in
these
circumstances.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
no,
i
think
what
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
it
can
only
be
raised
upon
some
showing
that
there
was
in
fact
a
defect
in
the
classification.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
if
there's
a
defect
in
the
classification
and
the
question
is
to
the
propriety
of
that
classification
was
raised
properly
through
the
selective
service
system.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
think
that's
true.
i
think
that
the
same
the
booking
into
the
constitution,
the
acts
of
the
court,
that
are
pointed.
i
don't
think
you
look
to
see
whether
in
determining
a
racial
discrimination
problem,
you
don't
look
to
see
whether
or
not
the
president
has
ever
pointed
a
negro
to
a
particular
court.
you
have
to
look
and
see
had
the
judge
--
did
the
judge
in
this
court
act
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
he's
there.
he
didn't
act
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
absolutely.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
absolutely
not.
it's
exactly
what
i'm
saying
is
that
you
have
to
treat
the
people
that's
invalidly
there
which
you
do
try
and
determine
as
to
whether
or
not
they
had
acted
out
of
racial
motives
and
where
there's
no
evidence
as
to
why
they
acted
to
that
reason,
that
the
classification
is
valid.
and
also
that
when
there
is
an
improper
classification,
that
classification
has
to
be
brought
to
the
--
through
this
system
where
it
can
also
be
corrected
before
it
can
be
brought
into
court.
