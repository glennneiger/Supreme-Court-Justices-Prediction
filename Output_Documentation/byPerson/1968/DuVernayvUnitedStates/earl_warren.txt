chief

well,
how
would
you

of
a
very
little
education
to
know
all
these
speculations
and
know
all
of
the
composition
of

boards
and
know
that
the
governor
that
state
had
never
appointed
a
negro
to
any
of
these
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
member
that
are
there
all
the
time.
how
would
you
expect
him
to
know
that
before
he
got
into
a
trial
and
had
the
advice
of
counsel?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
you
know
that's
true,
don't
you?
chief

a

is
that
a

you
were
never
interested
to
find
out
whether
those
things
were
true
even
though
it
was
argued
in
this
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
didn't
say
exactly
but.
chief

earl
warren
common

if
that's

but
what
can
a
--
what
can
a
poor
18-year

can
you
expect
him
to
do
something
about
this
until
he's
really
in
trouble,
until
they
order
him
inducted?
chief

about
the
policemen

did
have
a
mother
and
6
children
to
help
support.
chief

it
your
--

it
your
