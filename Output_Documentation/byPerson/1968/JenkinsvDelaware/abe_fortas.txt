she
was

at
least
the
nominal
lessee,
as
i
remember.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
assuming
that
ms.
marshall's
consent
was
valid
and
effective,
if
the
police
had
entered
the
premises
and
had
found
things
there
connecting
her
with
the
crime,
she
had
later
been
indicted,
you
wouldn't
have
any
question
about
the
use
of
that
would
you,
against
her?
justice
abe
fortas
what
precisely,
what
is
the
complaint
here?
is
it
that
the
police
were
not
in
good
faith
seeking
her
consent
to
the
search
of
the
premises?
as
i
understand
it,
what
you're
dealing
with
here
was
a
living
space.
was
it
a
house
or
an
apartment?
justice
abe
fortas
it's
an
entire
house
and
she
was
the
tenant
although
petitioner
paid
the
rent,
but
she
was
the
tenant
and
the
police
wanted
to
search
the
entire
house.
they
search
the
entire
house
and
they
came
across
the
junk,
did
they?
justice
abe
fortas
was
that
in
any
thing
identifiable
or
identified
or
identifiable
as
petitioner
separate
and
private
receptacle
such
as
a
locked
suitcase?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
what
you're
really
--
justice
abe
fortas
alright,
what
you're
really
saying,
if
i
correctly
understand
it,
is
that
apart
from
the
question
of
the
validity
of
her
consent,
assuming
that
her
consent
was
valid
that
the
police
would
then
be
--
were
then
warranted
and
searching
the
premises,
but
they
were
not
warranted
in
using
the
fruits
of
that
search
against
petitioner,
is
that
it?
justice
abe
fortas
an
alternative
would
be
to
argue
that
the
obtaining
of
her
consent
was
not
valid
because
she
was
really
the
target
of
the
search,
you're
not
arguing
that
are
you?
justice
abe
fortas
was
there
any
authority
for
that?
justice
abe
fortas
well
of
course
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
what
you're
advocating,
if
i
understand
you,
is
a
very
noble
doctrine
and
that
is
that
the
consent
has
to
be
obtained
not
from
the
person
having
some
sort
of
possessory
or
ownership
rights,
but
from
the
person
who
is
the
target
of
the
search.
i
--
it's
very
difficult
for
me
to
relate
your
argument
to
the
conceptual
standards
in
the
field,
except
in
those
terms
that
you're
asking
us
to
abandon,
the
possessory
or
ownership
standard,
and
to
substitute
for
it
a
rule
or
to
add
to
it
maybe
a
rule
that
the
police
always
have
to
obtain
the
consent
of
the
person
who
is
the
true
target
of
the
search
before
they
can
make
a
warrant
and
the
search.
justice
abe
fortas
now,
there's
no
--
nothing
in
our
books
to
that
effect,
is
there?
justice

this
is
what
would
be
a
new
doctrine?
