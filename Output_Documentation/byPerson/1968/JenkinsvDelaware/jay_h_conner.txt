mr.
jay
h.
conner
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
first
question
which
we
are
here
to
argue
is
whether
miranda
is
applicable
to
retrials.
now
five
circuits
and
nine
states
differ
with
delaware.
we've
got
five
that
agree
with
us,
five
states.
but
out
of
those
14
forums
that
differ
with
delaware,
only
one
decision,
and
that's
the
california
decision
of
people
versus
dorothy,
has
anymore
than
a
token
discussion
of
this
question.
the
13
other
forums
rely
on
the
one-word
trial
in
this
court's
decision
in
johnson
versus
new
jersey.
now,
we
submit
that
the
answer
to
this
question
does
not
lie
in
one
little
word
used
in
one
case.
now,
the
johnson
decision
is
important,
and
it
is
important
for
two
reasons.
number
one,
all
of
its
language
gives
guidance
as
to
the
answer
to
this
question.
and
number
two,
johnson
is
important
because
the
decision
that
this
court
reaches
in
this
case
should
be
able
to
be
reconciled
with
the
johnson
decision.
and
now
in
addition
to
johnson,
i
think
we
must
apply
logic,
common
sense
and
even
look
at
some
other
cases
which
lead
us
to
the
answer.
mr.
jay
h.
conner
mr.
justice
marshall,
the
date
of
confession
was
march
17,
'65,
first
trial
january
'66.
mr.
jay
h.
conner
would
the
johnson
rule
apply?
yes,
it
would.
the
state
would
be
out
of
luck.
mr.
jay
h.
conner
then
well,
under
that
hypothetical,
when
was
the
first
trial?
mr.
jay
h.
conner
the
rule
would
not
apply
sir.
mr.
jay
h.
conner
well,
there
are
several
differences.
i
think
this
goes
right
to
the
heart
of
the
whole
question.
mr.
jay
h.
conner
it's
our
--
it's
our
position
that
a
retrial
is
not
a
new
trial.
it
is
merely
a
continuation
or
an
extension
of
the
first
trial
and
that's
why
the
trial
really
begun
back
in
'65
and
not
in
'67
for
you
hypothetical.
i
think
another
way
to
point
this
out
would
be
to
say
if
this
court
started
to
write
the
decision
in
this
case
in
march
of
1969,
and
after
working
on
it
for
in
week,
you
tore
it
up,
then
you
come
back
in
april
of
'69
and
start
to
write
it
again.
i
think
you
would
have
to
say
that
you
began
the
work
in
march
of
'69
and
not
in
april
of
'69.
mr.
jay
h.
conner
this
is
the
same
trial
and
as
part
of
the
case.
mr.
jay
h.
conner
it
is
an
extension
of
the
same
trial,
yes
sir.
the
--
i
might
add
that
the
only
thing
which
is
new
about
a
new
trial
is
possibly
the
jury
and
well,
the
jury
is
new,
possibly
the
judge
might
be
new
as
well.
but
it
certainly
is
not
a
new
trial
as
far
as
the
parties
go.
the
defense
knows
what
the
prosecution's
evidence
is
going
to
be.
they
know
the
basis
of
the
admissibility
of
that
evidence.
they
know
what
witnesses
are
going
to
testify.
they
know
about
the
credibility
of
those
witnesses.
certainly,
a
lot
easier
to
cross-examine
the
second
time
than
the
first
time.
they
know
how
the
judge
is
going
to
rule
on
evidentiary
questions.
so,
a
retrial
is
really
not
new
trial,
except
for
the
fact
that
the
jury
treats
it
as
a
new
trial.
the
jury
hears
it
for
the
first
time.
now,
since
all
these
other
forums
play
such
heavy
reliance
on
johnson,
i'd
like
to
just
look
a
little
bit
at
some
of
the
other
language
in
the
johnson
decision.
first,
there's
language
in
the
johnson
decision
that
escobido
and
miranda
should
apply
to
cases
commenced
after
those
decisions
were
announced.
now
both
words
are
important
here
cases,
commenced.
now,
new
jersey
supreme
court
in
bigliano
in
discussing
this.
they
say
a
retrial
after
appellate
reversal
is
not
a
new
case,
but
simply
a
continuance
of
the
same
case
looking
toward
a
final
judgment
of
either
acquittal
or
conviction.
i
think
this
is
what
i
just
expressed
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
marshall.
when
a
case
commences,
it's
my
view
that
the
case
commences
even
before
the
previous
trial.
the
supreme
court
in
maryland
in
boone,
they
put
the
commencing
point
at
the
previous
trial
in
the
new
north
carolina
supreme
court
in
branch,
they
put
it
at
the
trial,
or
no,
at
the
interrogation
in
the
police
station.
i
place
the
point
of
a
case
commencing
at
the
first
time
the
defendant
is
taken
before
a
judicial
office
to
set
bail,
whether
that
be
united
states
commissioner
or
justice
of
the
peace,
or
a
magistrate.
and
the
basis
of
that
is
because
this
court,
since
its
inception
has
always
held
that
to
have
a
case,
there
has
to
be
a
controversy.
now
to
have
a
controversy,
there
has
to
be
two
sides,
and
the
first
point
at
which
both
sides
represented
before
some
judicial
authority
would
be
when
the
committing
taken
before
a
magistrate
to
set
bail
or
for
arraignment.
now,
after
the
commencing,
we
go
through
all
the
preliminary
hearing,
all
part
of
the
same
case.
we
go
through
grand
jury
indictment,
still
part
of
the
same
case.
trial
by
petty
jury,
part
of
the
same
case.
mr.
jay
h.
conner
well,
that's
language
used
in
that
decision,
yes
sir
mr.
justice
marshall,
but
when
you
look
at
really
what
--
mr.
jay
h.
conner
yes,
sir.
but
it
goes
to
what
is
the
definition
of
a
new
trial.
mr.
jay
h.
conner
they
did
say
new
trial.
but
i'm
just
pointing
out,
there
is
a
big
and
a
great
difference
between
a
trial
tried
for
the
second
time
and
a
trial
tried
for
the
first
time.
now,
there's
some
additional
language
in
johnson
which
is
important
and
that
language
says
“future
defendants
will
benefit
fully
from
our
standards
governing
in-custody
interrogation,
when
you're
talking
about
the
miranda
and
escobido
standards.”
now
certainly,
defendant
jenkins
who
was
arrested
back
in
march
of
1965
was
not
a
new
or
future
defendant
in
october
1967
when
he
was
tried
for
the
second
time.
now
johnson
--
in
johnson
this
court
also
points
out
that
the
police
shouldn't
be
punished
for
not
following
standards
which
were
not
standard
at
the
time
they
acted
and
this
court
differentiates
from
the
map
in
wolf
doctrine
where
the
police
did
have
the
wolf
standards,
but
didn't
follow
them.
so,
if
we
consider
that
on
a
retrial,
the
law
enforcement
and
the
prosecution
can
not
use
the
confession.
this
would
really
be
to
punish
the
police
for
acting
in
accordance
with
the
set
standards
at
the
time
they
took
--
at
the
time
they
took
the
confession.
now,
i
mentioned
at
the
beginning
that
this
decision
should
be
reconcilable
with
the
johnson
decision.
now,
if
this
court
determines,
as
my
friend
asked
that
miranda
is
applicable
to
a
retrial,
then
this
decision
can
not
be
reconcilable
with
the
johnson
decision,
because
it's
not
reconcilable
with
the
language
of
case
commenced.
now,
if
the
court
accepts
our
position
that
it
should
not
apply
to
a
retrial,
it
is
reconcilable
with
the
language
at
case
commenced.
it
can
also
be
reconcilable
with
the
language
trials
begun,
by
ruling
that
a
retrial
is
merely
an
extension
and
not
a
new
trial.
it
can
differ
with
the
supreme
court
delaware,
or
it
could
say
by
the
language
in
johnson
“we
intended
this
to
mean
a
trial
for
the
first
time.”
so,
it
can
be
reconciled
with
johnson.
now,
this
court
is
long
been
concerned
about
the
administration
of
justice
and
this
is
obvious
not
only
from
johnson
but
many
other
decisions.
many
cases
are
going
to
be
affected
if
it's
ruled
that
miranda
is
applicable
to
a
retrial.
the
amicus
brief
indicates
that
many
new
york
cases
will
be
affected.
in
delaware,
this
is
the
only
case
that
i
know
that
will
be
affected.
there
may
be
one
or
two
in
the
federal
habeas
corpus,
but
i'm
not
aware
of
it.
but
in
this
particular
case,
jenkins
if
this
confession
is
out,
we
can
not
prosecute.
we
don't
have
enough
evidence
and
it's
one
--
now
two
years
later,
it's
too
late
to
go
back
and
dig
up
or
come
up
with
some
fresh
evidence.
now,
counsel
is
probably
saying
“let's
not
excuse.
the
police
should've
done
a
thorough
job
the
first
time.”
this
is
an
argument,
but
realistically
speaking
the
last
10
years
of
course
there's
been
a
great
increase
in
crime.
but
there
hasn't
been
a
ratable
increase
in
the
number
of
man
that
man
our
police
departments.
though
the
police
when
they're
investigating
a
crime,
they're
forced
to
go
out
get
enough
evidence
which
will
be
legally
admissible,
in
which
will
be
sufficient
if
legally
admissible
to
obtain
a
conviction.
then
they
have
to
get
back
at
on
the
street
and
continue
on
other
investigations.
they
don't
have
the
manpower
and
they
don't
have
the
time
to
put
together
a
perfect
case.
and
it's
too
late
now
to
go
back
and
do
it.
mr.
jay
h.
conner
absolutely.
that
is
--
mr.
jay
h.
conner
i
may
have
misinterpreted
my
--
i
may
have
not
communicated
in
my
remarks
properly.
absolutely,
this
is
the
policeman's
duty,
but
realistically
speaking,
they
have
to
call
off
an
investigation
at
some
point
and
when
they
feel
that
they
had
spent
sufficient
and
have
sufficient
evidence
both
ways.
they
have
to
call
it
off
and
go
on
to
somebody
else,
mr.
chief
justice.
they
can't
make
a
career
out
of
one
case,
practically,
it's
just
not
possible.
enough
said
i
think
about
the
johnson
case.
i
might
say,
i
mentioned
the
california
case
of
people
versus
dorothy
and
in
california
they
have
a
statute
which
reads
something
like
this,
“the
granting
of
a
new
trial
places
the
parties
in
the
same
position
as
if
the
trial
--
as
if
no
trial
had
been
had.”
this
is
a
very
similar
to
the
discussion
which
i
just
had
with
mr.
justice
marshall
and
of
course
the
california
courts
are
bound
by
this
statute.
and
this
is
one
explanation
why
they
put
a
little
more
discussion
in
about
the
johnson
case.
as
i
pointed
out,
i
don't
agree
with
the
statute
because
the
new
trial
doesn't
really
place
the
parties
in
the
same
position
as
if
no
trial
had
been
had
for
the
reasons
that
have
been
previously
mentioned.
but
it
is
also
interesting
to
note
that
the
dorothy
case
in
california,
the
california
supreme
court
ruled
that
the
marijuana
had
been
properly
admitted
into
evidence
and
i
feel
that
you
can
put
the
marijuana
in
the
possession
of
somebody
that
the
court
may
have
felt
that
this
was
enough
evidence
for
them
to
get
a
conviction
the
second
time
without
the
confession.
mr.
jay
h.
conner
mr.
justice
stewart,
i'm
not
quite
sure
of
the
dorothy
date.
mr.
jay
h.
conner
yes,
sir.
i
think
the
dates
do
indicate
that.
people
versus
dorothy
was
in
'67.
i
think
stovol
came
down
in
june
of
'67.
mr.
jay
h.
conner
now,
it's
very
possible
that
dorothy
was
actually
argued
and
considered
prior
to
june
and
even
though
the
written
opinion
did
not
come
out
for
some
time.
mr.
jay
h.
conner
that
is
my
recollection
also,
and
my
next
point
which
was
i
going
to
discuss
exactly
was
the
stovol
case.
and
of
course
stovol
held
that
as
far
as
the
lineup
rules
are
concerned,
the
way
gilbert
rules
that
it's
the
date
of
confrontation,
which
is
the
critical
date.
but
there
are
some
other
language
in
the
stovol
decision
which
if
found
interesting
and
that
language
was,
“we
conclude
that
for
these
purposes,
no
distinction
is
justified
between
convictions
now
final
and
convictions
at
various.”
and
i
emphasize
various
“stages
of
trial
and
direct
review,”
various
stages
of
trial
and
direct
review.
now
likewise
in
the
confession
area,
logic
dictates
that
no
distinction
is
justified
between
the
defendant
who
confessed
prior
to
june
13,
1966
was
convicted,
sentenced
--
served
his
sentence
and
the
defendant,
who
also
confessed
prior
to
june
13,
1966
was
convicted,
but
gets
a
new
trial
for
reasons
not
related
to
the
confession.
secondly,
logic
dictates
that
the
rules
as
far
as
rate
of
counsel
should
not
differ,
as
far
as
the
retrial
is
concerned
for
identification
cases
and
for
confession
cases.
and
thirdly,
and
this
may
be
reiterated
and
repetitious
but
it
should
be
emphasized.
the
police
and
law
enforcement
should
not
be
punished
for
something
that
wasn't
the
law
at
the
time
they
acted.
now,
this
concludes
my
portion
of
the
argument
which
i
want
to
deal
with,
miranda
applying
to
retrials.
i
would
just
like
to
go
briefly
to
what
time
is
left
into
a
discussion
of
the
principles
that
are
involved
in
the
search
question
or
the
search
aspect
of
this
case.
before
going
in
this,
perhaps
the
factual
setting
should
be
made
clear,
mr.
herndon
alluded
to
the
fact
that
they
had
lived
together
for
some
years
as
man
and
wife.
delaware
does
not
recognize
common
law
marriages.
it
is
true
these
people
had
lived
together.
but
the
landlord
said
and
then
testified
that
he
rented
theses
premises
solely
to
leona
marshall.
as
far
as
he
was
concerned,
she
was
the
tenant.
he
had
never
heard
of
thornton
jenkins.
it
should
also
be
pointed
out
that
thornton
jenkins
was
arrested
back
in
march
17th,
1965,
and
when
this
case
came
to
trial
in
january
of
'66,
leona
marshall
was
still
residing
as
tenant
at
the
same
premises.
so,
there
is
no
dispute
as
to
who
is
the
tenant
and
who
has
the
property
interest.
our
supreme
court
used
the
term
joint
occupants.
now,
mr.
herndon
asked
this
court
to
rule
that
in
no
case
can
a
defendant
be
bound
when
a
third-party
consents
to
the
premises
or
to
the
premises
that
the
third-party
owns
or
occupies
or
has
the
possessory
interest
then
to
this
search.
now
if
you
carry
this
argument
--
mr.
jay
h.
conner
yes,
sir.
that
was
my
impression
from
listening
to
mr.
herndon
and
reading
the
briefs.
but
if
you
carry
this
position
to
its
logical
end
or
logical
extreme,
it
can't
work,
because
i
could
commit
a
crime
in
a
summer
resort.
i
could
go
to
a
man
whose
house
i
think
is
vacant
during
the
winter
period.
stash
some
of
the
stolen
goods
there.
he
could
--
a
man
comes
down
over
the
weekend
consents
to
the
police
to
search
the
house,
they
find
the
goods.
clearly,
clearly
no
violation
here,
proper
search.
backtracking
from
the
logic,
backtracking
from
the
extreme
a
little
bit,
supposed
thornton
jenkins
does
not
live
day
by
day
with
leona
marshall
but
only
visits
her?
he
goes
to
visit
her
with
stolen
goods.
leaves
some
of
the
stolen
goods
there,
the
search
is
consented
to.
clearly
again,
he
has
no
right
to
claim
that
this
search
wasn't
proper.
mr.
jay
h.
conner
well,
now
i
would
differ
there.
if
the
goods
were
in
plain
view
in
her
house
as
they
were
in
this
case,
then
they
have
the
right
to
seize
it.
they
are
covered
--
mr.
jay
h.
conner
there
still
no
--
just
property
is
being
invaded.
he
has
had
his
--
mr.
jay
h.
conner
well,
this
court
--
this
court
has
long
held
that
they
could
be
seized.
mr.
jay
h.
conner
yes,
sir.
you
can
seize
in
the
plain
sight
of
the
--
mr.
jay
h.
conner
they,
if
the
search,
if
the
search
is
proper
and
the
search
is
reasonable
then
anything
in
there
can
be
seized,
so
it's
the
reason
--
if
we
go
back
--
mr.
jay
h.
conner
well,
because
the
court
has
ruled
that
the
search
is
the
critical
thing.
the
reasonableness
of
the
search
is
what
the
critical
area.
mr.
jay
h.
conner
not
the
reasonableness
of
the
seizure.
mr.
jay
h.
conner
warrants
don't
go
to
seizure.
the
warrants
only
give
the
right
to
search.
mr.
jay
h.
conner
to
look
for
contraband
of
the
fruits
of
the
crime.
mr.
jay
h.
conner
they
look
for
tangible,
physical
evidence.
mr.
jay
h.
conner
no,
i
don't
go
that
far.
mr.
jay
h.
conner
well,
if
the
person
that
owns
the
effects
wanted
to
protect
his
privacy
interest
in
these
effects,
and
goes
to
the
trouble
to,
let's
say
enclose
them
and
prevent
them
and
keep
them
out
of
sight
of
the
general
public,
then
that
privacy
interest
should
be
respected.
but
when
he
comes
in
somebody's
house
and
lays
his
goods
down
in
the
open,
and
he
doesn't
have
much
interest
in
the
privacy
of
this
property,
and
i
think
that's
the
interim.
mr.
jay
h.
conner
yes,
sir.
mr.
jay
h.
conner
mr.
chief
justice,
in
this
case
i'm
going
to
rest
on
the
fact
that
these
goods
were
all
in
the
open.
i
don't
think
we
have
to
get
--
mr.
jay
h.
conner
well,
i
think
if
he
takes
mr.
chief
justice,
if
he
takes
them
to
his
own
home
--
mr.
jay
h.
conner
--
then
he
is
seeking
more
privacy.
mr.
jay
h.
conner
well,
if
--
when
a
man
chooses
to
live
in
an
extra
marital
relationship
with
another
woman,
he
is
giving
away
some
of
the
privacy
that
he
could've
had
by
living
in
marriage
relationship
or
living
by
himself.
so,
i
think
where
he
lives
also
goes
to
the
question
of
privacy.
mr.
jay
h.
conner
it
would
be
--
we
would
be
on
--
our
point
would
not
be
as
strong
as
he
lays
these
in
these
in
the
suitcase,
yes
sir.
now,
i
think
we
just
about
covered
all
the
points,
but
the
--
there
are
--
there
has
been
no
supreme
court
rulings
on
this.
the
circuit
courts
in
one
or
two
state
courts
have
held
that
a
mistress
or
a
joint
tenant
do
have
the
authority
in
their
own
right
to
consent
to
a
search
of
their
premises
and
once
they
have
this
authority,
the
search
is
reasonable.
the
evidence
seized
can
be
used
against
anyone.
again,
we
respectfully
ask
this
court
to
adhere
this
theory.
we
ask
this
court
to
determine
that
miranda
is
not
applicable
to
a
retrial
to
adhere
under
this
factual
situation
that
the
search
was
reasonable
and
the
seizure
prompt.
thank
you.
mr.
jay
h.
conner
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
first
question
which
we
are
here
to
argue
is
whether
miranda
is
applicable
to
retrials.
now
five
circuits
and
nine
states
differ
with
delaware.
we've
got
five
that
agree
with
us,
five
states.
but
out
of
those
14
forums
that
differ
with
delaware,
only
one
decision,
and
that's
the
california
decision
of
people
versus
dorothy,
has
anymore
than
a
token
discussion
of
this
question.
the
13
other
forums
rely
on
the
one-word
trial
in
this
court's
decision
in
johnson
versus
new
jersey.
now,
we
submit
that
the
answer
to
this
question
does
not
lie
in
one
little
word
used
in
one
case.
now,
the
johnson
decision
is
important,
and
it
is
important
for
two
reasons.
number
one,
all
of
its
language
gives
guidance
as
to
the
answer
to
this
question.
and
number
two,
johnson
is
important
because
the
decision
that
this
court
reaches
in
this
case
should
be
able
to
be
reconciled
with
the
johnson
decision.
and
now
in
addition
to
johnson,
i
think
we
must
apply
logic,
common
sense
and
even
look
at
some
other
cases
which
lead
us
to
the
answer.
mr.
jay
h.
conner
mr.
justice
marshall,
the
date
of
confession
was
march
17,
'65,
first
trial
january
'66.
mr.
jay
h.
conner
would
the
johnson
rule
apply?
yes,
it
would.
the
state
would
be
out
of
luck.
mr.
jay
h.
conner
then
well,
under
that
hypothetical,
when
was
the
first
trial?
mr.
jay
h.
conner
the
rule
would
not
apply
sir.
mr.
jay
h.
conner
well,
there
are
several
differences.
i
think
this
goes
right
to
the
heart
of
the
whole
question.
mr.
jay
h.
conner
it's
our
--
it's
our
position
that
a
retrial
is
not
a
new
trial.
it
is
merely
a
continuation
or
an
extension
of
the
first
trial
and
that's
why
the
trial
really
begun
back
in
'65
and
not
in
'67
for
you
hypothetical.
i
think
another
way
to
point
this
out
would
be
to
say
if
this
court
started
to
write
the
decision
in
this
case
in
march
of
1969,
and
after
working
on
it
for
in
week,
you
tore
it
up,
then
you
come
back
in
april
of
'69
and
start
to
write
it
again.
i
think
you
would
have
to
say
that
you
began
the
work
in
march
of
'69
and
not
in
april
of
'69.
mr.
jay
h.
conner
this
is
the
same
trial
and
as
part
of
the
case.
mr.
jay
h.
conner
it
is
an
extension
of
the
same
trial,
yes
sir.
the
--
i
might
add
that
the
only
thing
which
is
new
about
a
new
trial
is
possibly
the
jury
and
well,
the
jury
is
new,
possibly
the
judge
might
be
new
as
well.
but
it
certainly
is
not
a
new
trial
as
far
as
the
parties
go.
the
defense
knows
what
the
prosecution's
evidence
is
going
to
be.
they
know
the
basis
of
the
admissibility
of
that
evidence.
they
know
what
witnesses
are
going
to
testify.
they
know
about
the
credibility
of
those
witnesses.
certainly,
a
lot
easier
to
cross-examine
the
second
time
than
the
first
time.
they
know
how
the
judge
is
going
to
rule
on
evidentiary
questions.
so,
a
retrial
is
really
not
new
trial,
except
for
the
fact
that
the
jury
treats
it
as
a
new
trial.
the
jury
hears
it
for
the
first
time.
now,
since
all
these
other
forums
play
such
heavy
reliance
on
johnson,
i'd
like
to
just
look
a
little
bit
at
some
of
the
other
language
in
the
johnson
decision.
first,
there's
language
in
the
johnson
decision
that
escobido
and
miranda
should
apply
to
cases
commenced
after
those
decisions
were
announced.
now
both
words
are
important
here
cases,
commenced.
now,
new
jersey
supreme
court
in
bigliano
in
discussing
this.
they
say
a
retrial
after
appellate
reversal
is
not
a
new
case,
but
simply
a
continuance
of
the
same
case
looking
toward
a
final
judgment
of
either
acquittal
or
conviction.
i
think
this
is
what
i
just
expressed
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
marshall.
when
a
case
commences,
it's
my
view
that
the
case
commences
even
before
the
previous
trial.
the
supreme
court
in
maryland
in
boone,
they
put
the
commencing
point
at
the
previous
trial
in
the
new
north
carolina
supreme
court
in
branch,
they
put
it
at
the
trial,
or
no,
at
the
interrogation
in
the
police
station.
i
place
the
point
of
a
case
commencing
at
the
first
time
the
defendant
is
taken
before
a
judicial
office
to
set
bail,
whether
that
be
united
states
commissioner
or
justice
of
the
peace,
or
a
magistrate.
and
the
basis
of
that
is
because
this
court,
since
its
inception
has
always
held
that
to
have
a
case,
there
has
to
be
a
controversy.
now
to
have
a
controversy,
there
has
to
be
two
sides,
and
the
first
point
at
which
both
sides
represented
before
some
judicial
authority
would
be
when
the
committing
taken
before
a
magistrate
to
set
bail
or
for
arraignment.
now,
after
the
commencing,
we
go
through
all
the
preliminary
hearing,
all
part
of
the
same
case.
we
go
through
grand
jury
indictment,
still
part
of
the
same
case.
trial
by
petty
jury,
part
of
the
same
case.
mr.
jay
h.
conner
well,
that's
language
used
in
that
decision,
yes
sir
mr.
justice
marshall,
but
when
you
look
at
really
what
--
mr.
jay
h.
conner
yes,
sir.
but
it
goes
to
what
is
the
definition
of
a
new
trial.
mr.
jay
h.
conner
they
did
say
new
trial.
but
i'm
just
pointing
out,
there
is
a
big
and
a
great
difference
between
a
trial
tried
for
the
second
time
and
a
trial
tried
for
the
first
time.
now,
there's
some
additional
language
in
johnson
which
is
important
and
that
language
says
“future
defendants
will
benefit
fully
from
our
standards
governing
in-custody
interrogation,
when
you're
talking
about
the
miranda
and
escobido
standards.”
now
certainly,
defendant
jenkins
who
was
arrested
back
in
march
of
1965
was
not
a
new
or
future
defendant
in
october
1967
when
he
was
tried
for
the
second
time.
now
johnson
--
in
johnson
this
court
also
points
out
that
the
police
shouldn't
be
punished
for
not
following
standards
which
were
not
standard
at
the
time
they
acted
and
this
court
differentiates
from
the
map
in
wolf
doctrine
where
the
police
did
have
the
wolf
standards,
but
didn't
follow
them.
so,
if
we
consider
that
on
a
retrial,
the
law
enforcement
and
the
prosecution
can
not
use
the
confession.
this
would
really
be
to
punish
the
police
for
acting
in
accordance
with
the
set
standards
at
the
time
they
took
--
at
the
time
they
took
the
confession.
now,
i
mentioned
at
the
beginning
that
this
decision
should
be
reconcilable
with
the
johnson
decision.
now,
if
this
court
determines,
as
my
friend
asked
that
miranda
is
applicable
to
a
retrial,
then
this
decision
can
not
be
reconcilable
with
the
johnson
decision,
because
it's
not
reconcilable
with
the
language
of
case
commenced.
now,
if
the
court
accepts
our
position
that
it
should
not
apply
to
a
retrial,
it
is
reconcilable
with
the
language
at
case
commenced.
it
can
also
be
reconcilable
with
the
language
trials
begun,
by
ruling
that
a
retrial
is
merely
an
extension
and
not
a
new
trial.
it
can
differ
with
the
supreme
court
delaware,
or
it
could
say
by
the
language
in
johnson
“we
intended
this
to
mean
a
trial
for
the
first
time.”
so,
it
can
be
reconciled
with
johnson.
now,
this
court
is
long
been
concerned
about
the
administration
of
justice
and
this
is
obvious
not
only
from
johnson
but
many
other
decisions.
many
cases
are
going
to
be
affected
if
it's
ruled
that
miranda
is
applicable
to
a
retrial.
the
amicus
brief
indicates
that
many
new
york
cases
will
be
affected.
in
delaware,
this
is
the
only
case
that
i
know
that
will
be
affected.
there
may
be
one
or
two
in
the
federal
habeas
corpus,
but
i'm
not
aware
of
it.
but
in
this
particular
case,
jenkins
if
this
confession
is
out,
we
can
not
prosecute.
we
don't
have
enough
evidence
and
it's
one
--
now
two
years
later,
it's
too
late
to
go
back
and
dig
up
or
come
up
with
some
fresh
evidence.
now,
counsel
is
probably
saying
“let's
not
excuse.
the
police
should've
done
a
thorough
job
the
first
time.”
this
is
an
argument,
but
realistically
speaking
the
last
10
years
of
course
there's
been
a
great
increase
in
crime.
but
there
hasn't
been
a
ratable
increase
in
the
number
of
man
that
man
our
police
departments.
though
the
police
when
they're
investigating
a
crime,
they're
forced
to
go
out
get
enough
evidence
which
will
be
legally
admissible,
in
which
will
be
sufficient
if
legally
admissible
to
obtain
a
conviction.
then
they
have
to
get
back
at
on
the
street
and
continue
on
other
investigations.
they
don't
have
the
manpower
and
they
don't
have
the
time
to
put
together
a
perfect
case.
and
it's
too
late
now
to
go
back
and
do
it.
mr.
jay
h.
conner
absolutely.
that
is
--
mr.
jay
h.
conner
i
may
have
misinterpreted
my
--
i
may
have
not
communicated
in
my
remarks
properly.
absolutely,
this
is
the
policeman's
duty,
but
realistically
speaking,
they
have
to
call
off
an
investigation
at
some
point
and
when
they
feel
that
they
had
spent
sufficient
and
have
sufficient
evidence
both
ways.
they
have
to
call
it
off
and
go
on
to
somebody
else,
mr.
chief
justice.
they
can't
make
a
career
out
of
one
case,
practically,
it's
just
not
possible.
enough
said
i
think
about
the
johnson
case.
i
might
say,
i
mentioned
the
california
case
of
people
versus
dorothy
and
in
california
they
have
a
statute
which
reads
something
like
this,
“the
granting
of
a
new
trial
places
the
parties
in
the
same
position
as
if
the
trial
--
as
if
no
trial
had
been
had.”
this
is
a
very
similar
to
the
discussion
which
i
just
had
with
mr.
justice
marshall
and
of
course
the
california
courts
are
bound
by
this
statute.
and
this
is
one
explanation
why
they
put
a
little
more
discussion
in
about
the
johnson
case.
as
i
pointed
out,
i
don't
agree
with
the
statute
because
the
new
trial
doesn't
really
place
the
parties
in
the
same
position
as
if
no
trial
had
been
had
for
the
reasons
that
have
been
previously
mentioned.
but
it
is
also
interesting
to
note
that
the
dorothy
case
in
california,
the
california
supreme
court
ruled
that
the
marijuana
had
been
properly
admitted
into
evidence
and
i
feel
that
you
can
put
the
marijuana
in
the
possession
of
somebody
that
the
court
may
have
felt
that
this
was
enough
evidence
for
them
to
get
a
conviction
the
second
time
without
the
confession.
mr.
jay
h.
conner
mr.
justice
stewart,
i'm
not
quite
sure
of
the
dorothy
date.
mr.
jay
h.
conner
yes,
sir.
i
think
the
dates
do
indicate
that.
people
versus
dorothy
was
in
'67.
i
think
stovol
came
down
in
june
of
'67.
mr.
jay
h.
conner
now,
it's
very
possible
that
dorothy
was
actually
argued
and
considered
prior
to
june
and
even
though
the
written
opinion
did
not
come
out
for
some
time.
mr.
jay
h.
conner
that
is
my
recollection
also,
and
my
next
point
which
was
i
going
to
discuss
exactly
was
the
stovol
case.
and
of
course
stovol
held
that
as
far
as
the
lineup
rules
are
concerned,
the
way
gilbert
rules
that
it's
the
date
of
confrontation,
which
is
the
critical
date.
but
there
are
some
other
language
in
the
stovol
decision
which
if
found
interesting
and
that
language
was,
“we
conclude
that
for
these
purposes,
no
distinction
is
justified
between
convictions
now
final
and
convictions
at
various.”
and
i
emphasize
various
“stages
of
trial
and
direct
review,”
various
stages
of
trial
and
direct
review.
now
likewise
in
the
confession
area,
logic
dictates
that
no
distinction
is
justified
between
the
defendant
who
confessed
prior
to
june
13,
1966
was
convicted,
sentenced
--
served
his
sentence
and
the
defendant,
who
also
confessed
prior
to
june
13,
1966
was
convicted,
but
gets
a
new
trial
for
reasons
not
related
to
the
confession.
secondly,
logic
dictates
that
the
rules
as
far
as
rate
of
counsel
should
not
differ,
as
far
as
the
retrial
is
concerned
for
identification
cases
and
for
confession
cases.
and
thirdly,
and
this
may
be
reiterated
and
repetitious
but
it
should
be
emphasized.
the
police
and
law
enforcement
should
not
be
punished
for
something
that
wasn't
the
law
at
the
time
they
acted.
now,
this
concludes
my
portion
of
the
argument
which
i
want
to
deal
with,
miranda
applying
to
retrials.
i
would
just
like
to
go
briefly
to
what
time
is
left
into
a
discussion
of
the
principles
that
are
involved
in
the
search
question
or
the
search
aspect
of
this
case.
before
going
in
this,
perhaps
the
factual
setting
should
be
made
clear,
mr.
herndon
alluded
to
the
fact
that
they
had
lived
together
for
some
years
as
man
and
wife.
delaware
does
not
recognize
common
law
marriages.
it
is
true
these
people
had
lived
together.
but
the
landlord
said
and
then
testified
that
he
rented
theses
premises
solely
to
leona
marshall.
as
far
as
he
was
concerned,
she
was
the
tenant.
he
had
never
heard
of
thornton
jenkins.
it
should
also
be
pointed
out
that
thornton
jenkins
was
arrested
back
in
march
17th,
1965,
and
when
this
case
came
to
trial
in
january
of
'66,
leona
marshall
was
still
residing
as
tenant
at
the
same
premises.
so,
there
is
no
dispute
as
to
who
is
the
tenant
and
who
has
the
property
interest.
our
supreme
court
used
the
term
joint
occupants.
now,
mr.
herndon
asked
this
court
to
rule
that
in
no
case
can
a
defendant
be
bound
when
a
third-party
consents
to
the
premises
or
to
the
premises
that
the
third-party
owns
or
occupies
or
has
the
possessory
interest
then
to
this
search.
now
if
you
carry
this
argument
--
mr.
jay
h.
conner
yes,
sir.
that
was
my
impression
from
listening
to
mr.
herndon
and
reading
the
briefs.
but
if
you
carry
this
position
to
its
logical
end
or
logical
extreme,
it
can't
work,
because
i
could
commit
a
crime
in
a
summer
resort.
i
could
go
to
a
man
whose
house
i
think
is
vacant
during
the
winter
period.
stash
some
of
the
stolen
goods
there.
he
could
--
a
man
comes
down
over
the
weekend
consents
to
the
police
to
search
the
house,
they
find
the
goods.
clearly,
clearly
no
violation
here,
proper
search.
backtracking
from
the
logic,
backtracking
from
the
extreme
a
little
bit,
supposed
thornton
jenkins
does
not
live
day
by
day
with
leona
marshall
but
only
visits
her?
he
goes
to
visit
her
with
stolen
goods.
leaves
some
of
the
stolen
goods
there,
the
search
is
consented
to.
clearly
again,
he
has
no
right
to
claim
that
this
search
wasn't
proper.
mr.
jay
h.
conner
well,
now
i
would
differ
there.
if
the
goods
were
in
plain
view
in
her
house
as
they
were
in
this
case,
then
they
have
the
right
to
seize
it.
they
are
covered
--
mr.
jay
h.
conner
there
still
no
--
just
property
is
being
invaded.
he
has
had
his
--
mr.
jay
h.
conner
well,
this
court
--
this
court
has
long
held
that
they
could
be
seized.
mr.
jay
h.
conner
yes,
sir.
you
can
seize
in
the
plain
sight
of
the
--
mr.
jay
h.
conner
they,
if
the
search,
if
the
search
is
proper
and
the
search
is
reasonable
then
anything
in
there
can
be
seized,
so
it's
the
reason
--
if
we
go
back
--
mr.
jay
h.
conner
well,
because
the
court
has
ruled
that
the
search
is
the
critical
thing.
the
reasonableness
of
the
search
is
what
the
critical
area.
mr.
jay
h.
conner
not
the
reasonableness
of
the
seizure.
mr.
jay
h.
conner
warrants
don't
go
to
seizure.
the
warrants
only
give
the
right
to
search.
mr.
jay
h.
conner
to
look
for
contraband
of
the
fruits
of
the
crime.
mr.
jay
h.
conner
they
look
for
tangible,
physical
evidence.
mr.
jay
h.
conner
no,
i
don't
go
that
far.
mr.
jay
h.
conner
well,
if
the
person
that
owns
the
effects
wanted
to
protect
his
privacy
interest
in
these
effects,
and
goes
to
the
trouble
to,
let's
say
enclose
them
and
prevent
them
and
keep
them
out
of
sight
of
the
general
public,
then
that
privacy
interest
should
be
respected.
but
when
he
comes
in
somebody's
house
and
lays
his
goods
down
in
the
open,
and
he
doesn't
have
much
interest
in
the
privacy
of
this
property,
and
i
think
that's
the
interim.
mr.
jay
h.
conner
yes,
sir.
mr.
jay
h.
conner
mr.
chief
justice,
in
this
case
i'm
going
to
rest
on
the
fact
that
these
goods
were
all
in
the
open.
i
don't
think
we
have
to
get
--
mr.
jay
h.
conner
well,
i
think
if
he
takes
mr.
chief
justice,
if
he
takes
them
to
his
own
home
--
mr.
jay
h.
conner
--
then
he
is
seeking
more
privacy.
mr.
jay
h.
conner
well,
if
--
when
a
man
chooses
to
live
in
an
extra
marital
relationship
with
another
woman,
he
is
giving
away
some
of
the
privacy
that
he
could've
had
by
living
in
marriage
relationship
or
living
by
himself.
so,
i
think
where
he
lives
also
goes
to
the
question
of
privacy.
mr.
jay
h.
conner
it
would
be
--
we
would
be
on
--
our
point
would
not
be
as
strong
as
he
lays
these
in
these
in
the
suitcase,
yes
sir.
now,
i
think
we
just
about
covered
all
the
points,
but
the
--
there
are
--
there
has
been
no
supreme
court
rulings
on
this.
the
circuit
courts
in
one
or
two
state
courts
have
held
that
a
mistress
or
a
joint
tenant
do
have
the
authority
in
their
own
right
to
consent
to
a
search
of
their
premises
and
once
they
have
this
authority,
the
search
is
reasonable.
the
evidence
seized
can
be
used
against
anyone.
again,
we
respectfully
ask
this
court
to
adhere
this
theory.
we
ask
this
court
to
determine
that
miranda
is
not
applicable
to
a
retrial
to
adhere
under
this
factual
situation
that
the
search
was
reasonable
and
the
seizure
prompt.
thank
you.
