versus
delaware.
mr.
herndon,
you
may
proceed
with
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
conner.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
really
true
that
all
the
police
are
required
to
do
is
to
go
out
and
get
the
bare
amount
that
they
think
is
sufficient
to
sustain
a
conviction?
aren't
they
obligated
under
their
oath
to
go
out
and
get
all
the
evidence
that
is
available
and
even
if
it
should
cut
both
ways?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
thought
that
--
i
didn't
understand
you
to
say
that
was
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
he
go
that
far?
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
he
had
hid
these
things
that
they
took
so
that
they
were
not
immediately
visible,
would
you
say
they
could've
gone
in
and
taken
them
out
then?
or
do
you
rest
upon
the
fact
that
these
things
are
right
out
on
the
open
in
a
home
--
in
the
home
there
for
anyone
to
see?
chief
justice
earl
warren
we
have
to
go
a
little
farther.
we
have
to
go
a
little
farther
than
that,
don't
--
we
wouldn't
determine
what
affect
this
will
have
on
other
cases
and
that
you
say
they
were
right
out
there
in
the
open.
but
i
suppose
if
the
man
takes
things
to
his
home
then
puts
them
in
a
room
that
doesn't
mean
that
even
though
they
might
be
observable
in
the
room,
that
doesn't
mean
that
he
has
no
more
privacy
in
them
so
far
as
the
public
is
concerned,
does
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
isn't
this
his
home?
chief
justice
earl
warren
isn't
this
his
home?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
it
would've
been
alright
if
he'd
put
them
on
a
suitcase?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
herndon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
herndon,
the
court
understands
that
you
were
appointed
by
the
court
below
to
represent
this
man
as
an
indigent
defendant
and
you
carried
the
case
on
through
this
court.
we
consider
that
to
be
a
real
public
service,
and
we
appreciate
your
having
done
that.
as
we
appreciate
the
service
of
all
lawyers
in
that
respect.
and
mr.
conner,
of
course
we
appreciate
the
diligent
matter
in
which
you
have
represented
the
people
of
your
state.
