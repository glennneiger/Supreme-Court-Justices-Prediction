justice

white
was
the
search
point
raised
in
the
second
appeal?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
why
does
the
opinion
left
to
deal
with,
don't
you
think?
justice
byron
r.
white
for
record
purposes.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
--
you
say
that
the
police
were
rightfully
in
the
house.
if
her
consent
was
valid
for
herself,
you
indicate
the
police
are
rightfully
in
the
house?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
let's
assume
that
while
they're
properly
in
the
house,
they
see
some
narcotics
in
the
mantle
piece,
and
they
say
“whose
narcotics
are
those?”
and
she
says
“they're
my
husband's.”
and
they
say
“may
we
take
them?”
and
she
says
“no,
they're
not
mine.
they're
his,
they're
his
effects.”
they
could
they
still
take
them,
couldn't
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
not
only
want
new
doctrine,
you
want
some
reversal
to
some
old
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
just
assume
that
under
the
last
example
that
--
that
a
thief
lives
stolen
goods
in
the
house
of
his
girlfriend,
but
he
just
happens
to
leave
it
on
the
suitcase
with
his
name
on
it
and
that
sits.
and
she
consents
the
police
come
in
and
then
they
say
“may
we
take
that
suitcase?”
she
says
“sure.”
or
“may
we
look
in
it?”
she
says
“surely,
it's
mine.”
now
what
kind
of
a
result
would
there
be
then?
same
result,
are
you
saying
that
you're
urging?
justice
byron
r.
white
why?
they're
his.
justice
byron
r.
white
fourth
amendment
protects
effects
as
well
as
houses
to
his
effects.
they
maybe
rightfully
in
the
house,
they
maybe
rightfully
in
the
house
because
of
her
consent,
but
how
can
they
seize
his
effects
without
his
consent.
you've
got
a
property
interest
in
the
effects,
they're
not
hers.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
on
what
basis?
do
you
think
harris
--
harris
case
that
you
can
seize
things
in
plain
sight
in
the
house?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
but
why
could
they
do
that?
why
can
they
do
that
without
a
warrant?
it
isn't
because
of
consent
if
somebody
else
surely.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
why
is
that?
why
is
that?
why
may
you
seize
effects
without
a
warrant
when
you
couldn't
search
the
house
without
a
warrant
or
without
consent?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
that
you
said
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
you've
said
that
before
but
i'd
like
to
know
why
it's
reasonable
to
seize
somebody's
property
that's
protected
by
the
fourth
amendment
without
a
warrant?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
wait
a
minute,
the
warrants
always
give
the
right
seize.
what's
the
purpose
of
the
search
usually?
justice
byron
r.
white
simply
look
for
physical
evidences.
i
mean
for
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
look
for
--
most
of
the
time
anyway.
sometimes,
just
really
to
search
the
house
but,
do
you
suppose
if
the
--
you
think
the
fourth
amendment
provision
about
effects
then
is
just
irrelevant
or
a
redundancy?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
had
told
me
then
why
a
policeman
searching
a
house
ought
to
be
able
seize
somebody
else's
effects?
why
can't
he
seize
--
if
he
has
consent
to
come
in
a
house
and
he
sees
a
suitcase
of
somebody
else,
the
example
used
a
while
ago.
the
suitcase
has
somebody
else's
name
on
it.
he
says
“whose
is
this?”
and
the
householder
says
“well
that
belongs
to
my
boyfriend.”
now,
why
can't
the
police
seize
that
suitcase?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
couldn't
seize
the
suitcase,
but
you
could
seize
the
clothes
in
the
suitcase
if
the
suitcase
was
lying
open?
justice

was
the
