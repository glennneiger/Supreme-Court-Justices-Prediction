well,
suppose
this
man
had
been
in
the
federal
penitentiary
and
didn't
get
out
until
'67
and
was
tried
in
'67,
would
the
rule
apply?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
that's

now
suppose
at
the
end
of
this
trial,
the

him
a

the
first

was
in
'65,
and

granted

you
have
to
find
something
to
distinguish
it
from.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
your
point
is,
this
is
the
same
trial?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it's
a
different
judge,
a
different
jury,
different
everything
it
was
the
same
trial?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
conner,
i
hate
to
stick
to
my
point
