mr.
henry
n.
herndon,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
murder
case
in
which
the
defendant's
conviction
of
first
degree
murder
was
reversed
by
the
delaware
supreme
court
for
a
trial
de
novo.
he
was
tried
again
after
this
court's
decision
in
miranda
and
convicted
of
second
degree
murder.
the
delaware
supreme
court
subsequently
entered
a
judgment
affirming
that
conviction,
and
this
court
granted
certiorari
to
review
that
judgment.
two
issues
are
raised
in
this
proceeding.
first,
are
the
standards
of
miranda
applicable
to
all
trials
including
retrials
commenced
after
the
decision
was
announced?
secondly,
does
the
warrantless
search
of
a
suspects
home
based
solely
upon
the
consent
of
his
co-occupant,
violate
the
suspect's
rights
under
the
fourth
amendment
where
he
was
physically
present
and
immediately
to
give
or
withhold
his
consent,
and
where
the
purpose
of
the
search
was
to
obtain
evidence
not
against
his
co-occupant,
but
against
he
suspect
himself?
the
facts
are
not
in
dispute.
indeed,
the
statement
of
the
case
in
the
brief
of
the
respondent
is
identical
to
that
in
the
petitioner's
brief.
the
very
and
very
summary
form
of
the
facts
are
these.
on
the
morning
of
march
17,
1965,
officers
of
the
wilmington,
delaware
police
department
were
called
to
investigate
in
apparent
homicide.
the
victim
was
found
in
a
junkyard.
subsequent
examination
of
the
body
by
an
assistant
medical
examiner
disclosed
that
the
victim
had
died
sometime
the
prior
evening.
the
petitioner
and
a
companion
had
been
observed
on
the
street
in
the
vicinity
of
that
junkyard
on
that
prior
evening.
they
had
been
apprehended
and
taken
to
the
police
station
where
they
were
questioned
by
a
sergeant
maloney
and
subsequently
released.
sergeant
maloney's
name
will
come
again.
between
9
and
10
o'clock
on
the
morning
of
the
march
the
17th,
that
is
the
day
after
the
initial
apprehension.
sergeant
maloney
went
with
four
other
officers
to
the
home
of
the
petitioner.
his
purpose
was
to
see
if
the
petitioner
and
his
companion
of
the
prior
evening
were
there.
the
petitioner's
lady
friend,
ms.
marshall,
answered
the
door
and
sergeant
maloney
indeed
asked
if
thornton
jenkins,
the
petitioner
was
present.
the
petitioner
and
his
companion,
his
lady
friend
and
three
other
persons,
being
all
of
those
present
in
the
house
were
apprehended
at
that
time
and
taken
to
the
detective
division
of
the
police
station.
a
bit
of
geography
might
be
of
assistance
here.
it
seems
that
all
of
the
county
and
municipal
functions
in
the
new
castle,
delaware
are
taking
care
of
in
a
single
building
called
the
public
building,
which
has
at
one
end
the
city
functions
and
at
the
other
end,
its
county
functions.
the
police
station
is
located
in
the
city
end
of
that
public
building.
at
the
police
station,
the
petitioner
was
placed
in
a
so
called
recording
room
located
in
the
detective
division.
at
11
o'clock
that
morning,
he
was
charged
with
night
prowling.
at
11:40
that
morning,
sergeant
maloney,
according
to
his
testimony,
advised
the
petitioner's
lady
friend
of
and
his
words
“her
rights”
and
requested
permission
to
search
the
house.
she
told
him
that
he
could
search
the
house,
which
he
then
did,
discovering
of
junk
and
clothing
which
were
seized
and
later
introduced
into
evidence
at
the
trial.
i'll
return
when
we
come
to
the
subject
of
the
validity
of
this
search
to
some
more
specific
facts
on
that
issue.
now,
later
that
same
afternoon
at
1:15
p.m.,
the
petitioner
was
formally
charged
with
fourth
degree
burglary
and
murder
in
the
first
degree.
subsequently
at
7
p.m.,
an
incriminating
written
statement
was
obtained
from
him.
the
purpose
of
this
confession
was
of
course
to
verify
what
the
police
officers
had
already
concluded,
namely
that
the
petitioner
was
that
person,
or
at
least
one
of
them
who
had
committed
the
homicide
then
under
investigation.
although,
the
evidence
is
conflicting
upon
what
warnings
were
given
to
the
petitioner
and
when
they
were
given
regarding
his
fifth
amendment
rights.
for
the
petitioner
for
example,
insist
that
he
was
not
given
any
warnings
until
after
he
had
signed
the
statement.
it
is
clear
that
he
was
not
advised
of
his
right
to
have
counsel
supplied
to
him
in
the
event
he
wished
and
was
enable
to
afford
counsel.
timely
motions
to
suppress
both
the
products
of
the
search
and
the
statement
were
filed
both
before
and
during
the
trials
and
were
denied.
petitioner's
first
trial
began
in
january
of
1966,
and
his
more
recent
trial
in
october
of
'67.
it
was
the
petitioner's
second
trial
in
october
of
'67
which
poses
the
first
issue
raised
here.
following
his
initial
conviction,
the
delaware
supreme
court
reversed
for
several
reasons,
none
of
them
relating
to
the
petitioner's
statement,
and
in
so
doing
directed
that
although
the
new
trial
was
to
be
de
novo,
the
standards
proscribed
by
miranda
were
not
to
be
applied.
johnson
held
that
miranda
would
apply
only
to
trials
begun
after
that
decision,
namely
miranda,
was
announced.
it
was
not
specifically
concerned
with
and
did
not
expressly
hold
whether
a
retrial
was
among
the
trials
in
which
miranda
was
to
be
applicable.
for
four
major
reasons,
we
submit
that
the
admissibility
of
a
criminal
defendant's
incriminating
statement
at
a
retrial
should
be
measured
by
the
same
gauge
as
any
other
defendant
going
to
trial
at
the
same
time,
very
briefly,
those
reasons
are
these.
first,
the
purpose
of
the
miranda
rule
is
to
enhance
the
reliability
of
the
fact
finding
process
at
trial.
now,
that
purpose
could
not
be
fully
implemented
if
it
were
applicable
only
to
some
trials.
now
here,
we
think
that
the
contrasting
treatment
in
stovall
of
the
way
gilbert
rules
is
enlightening.
there
of
course,
the
critical
time
was
fixed
as
the
time
of
the
confrontation.
the
time
when
the
identification
took
place.
here,
the
time
was
fixed
at
trial.
similarly,
in
this
court's
recent
decision
in
fuller
versus
alaska
announcing
the
applicability
of
the
lee
versus
florida
rule,
once
again,
the
time
was
fixed.
not
the
time
that
the
officers
obtained
the
evidence
in
violation
of
section
605
of
the
federal
communication
act,
but
at
the
time
of
trial
and
once
again
however,
no
distinction
being
made
as
to
the
types
of
trial.
but
certainly
would
seem
that
if
the
rule
in
lee
versus
florida,
which
--
in
which
--
as
to
which
the
court
said
that
it
doesn't
go
to
the
enhancement
of
the
fact
finding
process.
the
trial
is
going
to
be
applicable
at
trials
subsequent
to
the
time
that
decision
was
announced.
it
would
seem
anomalous
to
not
apply
at
least
in
the
retrial
context,
a
rule
which
does
to
the
core
of
the
fact
finding
process.
second,
our
second
reason
is
this,
in
fixing
the
extent
to
which
there
maybe
full
effectuation
of
the
individual's
fifth
amendment
rights
at
trial,
the
results
of
his
prior
in-custody
interrogation
may
and
frequently
are
determinative.
it
is
difficult
if
not
impossible
to
distinguish
between
the
exercise
of
those
rights
during
an
in-custody
interrogation
and
during
trial,
to
the
extent
they
have
been
lost
in
the
interrogation
process
they
can
not
be
fully
exercised
at
trial.
the
choice
of
whether
or
not
to
testify
may
then
not
be
as
a
practical
matter,
one
which
is
open
to
the
defendant.
third
reason
is
this,
there
is
a
seeming
impairment
of
judicial
integrity
in
sanctioning
the
simultaneous
trials
of
different
persons
in
adjoining
courts
but
by
different
standards
and
perhaps,
it
is
reading
too
much
into
johnson,
but
it
appears
to
have
as
one
of
its
purposes
the
implementation
of
the
miranda's
protections
as
soon
as
possible,
but
at
the
same
time
minimizing
any
disruptive
effects
which
would
be
caused
by
its
application.
that
there
would
be
some
disruption
is
apparent,
because
johnson
would
not
exclude
or
would
exclude
from
evidence
that
those
confessions
which
were
obtained
either
prior
to
the
announcement
of
miranda,
or
indeed
after,
ff
they
were
in
compliance
with
miranda
standards
provided
that
no
trial
of
any
kind
had
been
commenced
by
that
date.
and
fourth,
there
is
an
obvious
point
and
perhaps
too
obvious
that
where
johnson
uses
the
words
trials,
that's
exactly
what
was
meant,
and
no
exclusion
of
all
trials,
except
a
defendant's
first
appearance
at
the
bar
was
intended.
most
of
the
decision
which
are
cited
in
all
of
the
briefs,
including
that
of
the
amicus
attorney
general
state
of
new
york,
on
that
or
supporting
the
decision
or
in
accord
with
the
decision
of
the
delaware
supreme
court
in
this
case,
pick
the
critical
word
as
cases.
and
what
they
have
done
with
this
word
is
sometimes
very
interesting.
for
example,
in
the
case
of
boone
versus
state,
i
take
that
in
that
correction,
state
versus
branch,
a
north
carolina
decision
and
the
court
there
found
that
the
word
case
was
determinative
and
how
that
a
case
begins
at
the
time
of
the
in-custody
interrogation.
and
i
suggest
that
that
gives
substantial
warping
to
the
johnson
decision.
i'd
like
to
make
one
or
two
brief
comments
upon
the
brief
of
the
amicus
curiae.
first
he
urged
that
--
the
amicus
urges
that
the
new
york
courts
have
relied
upon
the
non-applicability
of
miranda
in
reversing
subsequent
cases.
we
would
suggest
that
the
cases
were
reversed
because
they
had
either
been
wrongly
decided
or
for
some
other
error
committed
during
the
course
at
trial.
secondly,
it's
argued
that
miranda
should
not,
and
i'm
quoting,
“be
applied
to
past
convictions
merely
because
a
retrial
is
ordered.”
i
would
suggest
that
if
a
retrial
is
ordered,
there
is
no
past
conviction
but
only
a
future
trial.
finally,
the
amicus
contends
that
the
primary
aim
of
miranda
was
to
change
the
circumstances
of
interrogation.
i
would
suggest
that
that
simply
is
not
what
--
that
is
one
of
the
purposes,
but
is
not
the
primary
purpose.
we
turn
now
to
the
search
and
seizure
question.
and
there,
i
think
some
additional
facts
maybe
of
assistance.
the
petitioner
and
his
lady
friend,
leona
marshall,
had
lived
together
as
man
and
wife
for
about
three
or
four
years
prior
to
his
arrest.
they
had
lived
in
the
house
where
the
petitioner
was
apprehended
for
a
period
of
anywhere
from,
according
to
here
testimony,
two
of
those
years
to
perhaps
nine
months
according
to
the
landlord.
between
9
and
10
o'clock
on
the
morning
of
march
17,
some
five
officers
of
the
wilmington
police
department
went
to
the
petitioner's
home
to
apprehend
the
petitioner
and
his
companion
of
the
prior
evening.
sergeant
maloney
knocked
on
the
front
door,
ms.
marshall
still
dressed
in
a
house
coat,
answered
the
door.
sergeant
maloney
asked
for
the
petitioner.
the
people
in
the
house
were
then
collected
in
one
of
the
rooms,
which
i
think
sergeant
maloney
described
as
a
dining
room,
where
ms.
marshall
observed
the
petitioner's
companion
being
directed
to
lean
against
the
wall
and
being
patted
down.
she
was
told
to
get
some
clothes
on
and
testified
if
she
was
advised
that
the
people
in
the
house
were
going
downtown.
they
were
taken
in
to
police
station.
all
of
those
apprehended,
except
for
the
petitioners
and
his
companion,
were
seated
on
a
bench
immediately
outside
the
detective
division
portion
of
the
police
station.
the
petitioner
was
taken
inside
and
placed
in
a
so
called
recording
room,
which
is
a
separate
room
within
the
larger
confine
of
the
detective
division.
sergeant
maloney
thereafter
sought
ms.
marshall's
permission
to
search
the
house.
the
record
is
clear
that
at
that
time,
sergeant
maloney
had
ms.
marshall
in
custody.
he
knew
that
the
petitioner
lived
at
the
house
to
be
search.
he
knew
that
the
petitioner
was
one
of
the
two
prime
suspects
in
the
homicide
investigation
then
being
conducted.
he
knew
that
the
petitioner
was
present
in
the
recording
room.
he
proposed
to
conduct
the
search
to
obtain
evidence
of
the
petitioner's
guilt
to
the
homicide,
and
he
made
no
effort
whatsoever
to
obtain
the
petitioner's
consent
to
the
search.
for
her
part,
ms.
marshall
had
a
limited
comprehension
of
what
the
search
was
all
about
and
what
her
rights
were.
basically,
she
testified
that
she
just
didn't
know
what
it
was
all
about
because
the
police
didn't
tell
her.
she
didn't
know
that
she
was
not
required
to
permit
a
search.
she
thought
the
police
could
the
property
simply
because
they
wanted
to,
and
i
think
it's
--
i
should
say
to
that
she
assumed
that
they
could
just
get
a
search
warrant
by
some
process
that
she
didn't
understand,
but
that
they
could
get
one.
but
any
event,
as
a
result,
she
did
permit
the
search
for
no
reason
really
other
than
the
police
asked
here
to.
the
search
therefore
was
without
a
warrant
and
was
not
conducted
incident
to
a
lawful
arrest.
the
sole
basis
for
its
legitimacy
was
the
acquiescence
of
ms.
marshall,
petitioner's
co-occupant
in
the
request
of
the
police
for
permission
to
search
and
that
--
mr.
henry
n.
herndon,
jr.
the
testimony
of
the
landlord
says
that
as
far
as
he
was
concerned,
she
was
the
only
tenant
of
the
property.
the
delaware
supreme
court
in
its
first
opinion
so
held.
the
evidence
also
discloses,
mr.
justice
fortas
that
the
rent
money
came
from
the
petitioner,
if
that's
significant.
mr.
henry
n.
herndon,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
it
was.
it
was
raised
in
both
appeals.
the
opinion
--
mr.
henry
n.
herndon,
jr.
yes
your
honor,
it
does
in
the
--
it
points
out
that
the
petitioner
raises
for
the
record
the
same
issues
at
pages
101
and
102
--
mr.
henry
n.
herndon,
jr.
--
record
purposes.
these
--
both
these
points
had
been
dealt
with
at
the
first
trial
and
had
been
rejected
in
the
first
appeal
by
the
delaware
supreme
court.
the
acquiescence
of
ms.
marshall,
we
suggest,
does
not
measure
up
to
the
requirements
of
the
fourth
amendment
for
two
basic
reasons.
first
of
all,
her
positive
response
to
the
request
for
permission
of
search
was
not
made
with
any
real
comprehension
of
what
her
fourth
amendment
rights
were.
and
second,
irrespective
of
whether
ms.
marshall's
permission
to
search
effectively
waived
her
own
rights.
we
submit
that
she
could
not
waive
the
petitioner's
rights,
and
even
if
it
is
assumed
that
if
that
a
co-occupant
simply
because
he
is
a
co-occupant,
can
waive
another's
fourth
amendment
protections.
the
search
here
was
nevertheless
unreasonable
where
it
was
the
petitioner,
who
was
the
prime
murder
suspect,
where
it
was
him
against
whom
evidence
was
being
sought
and
where
he
was
immediately
available
to
give
her
with
all
that
consent.
common
to
both
reasons
is
a
precept
that
a
warrantless
search
is
in
violation
of
the
constitution,
unless
it
can
be
demonstrated
as
being
within
one
of
the
well
defined
exceptions
to
the
general
requirement
that
a
search
must
rest
upon
a
search
warrant.
necessity
may
justify
a
search
in
certain
circumstances.
but
absent
necessity,
a
warrantless
search
must
be
supported
by
valid
consent,
as
to
the
first
reasons,
the
insufficiency
of
ms.
marshall's
consent.
like
the
fifth
amendment,
the
fourth
--
the
aim
of
the
fourth
is
in
part
certainly
to
avoid
any
compulsion
upon
the
individual
to
incriminate
him
self.
evidence
of
a
suspected
crime
whether
from
the
suspect's
own
mouth
or
whether
from
his
possessions
or
his
home
have
the
same
result.
if
a
waiver
of
this
right
is
to
be
relied
upon,
then
there
does
not
appear
to
be
any
justification
for
surrounding
that
right
with
a
lesser
degree
of
protection
then
is
the
case
for
the
fifth
amendment.
and
thus,
if
a
waiver
is
to
be
relied
upon,
it
must
be
established
that
ms.
marshall
fully
comprehended
what
her
rights
were
before
her
consent
to
the
search
can
be
characterized
as
effective
to
support
the
search.
and
the
burden
here
of
establishing
that
waiver
is
upon
the
state.
in
this
case,
we
submit
that
the
burden
has
not
been
sustained.
as
to
the
second
reason,
as
far
as
petitioner
is
aware,
this
court
has
never
upheld
the
validity
of
a
third-party
consent
to
a
search
--
let
me
state
that
in
other
way.
as
far
as
the
petitioner
is
aware,
this
court
has
never
specifically
held
that
a
third-party
effectively
waived
the
fourth
amendment
rights
of
a
defendant.
once
it
is
recognized
that
the
fourth
amendment
protects
people
and
not
simply
places
or
things,
and
that
the
rights
of
the
individual
are
personal
rights,
then
it
is
difficult
to
accept
that
those
rights
may
be
dismembered
by
one
who
has
absolutely
no
interest
in
their
protection.
anything
else
such
as
the
possession
and
control
rule
relied
upon
the
delaware
courts
and
many
of
the
lower
courts,
necessarily
--
lower
federal
courts
--
necessarily
involves
an
analysis
of
relative
and
competing
property
interests,
and
makes
them
determinative
of
who
can
consent
to
the
search.
the
waiver
therefore
must
be
by
the
person
whose
rights
are
involved.
either
he
must
waive
it
in
person
or
through
an
agent.
but
in
either
case,
the
waiver
or
authority
to
waive
must
be
explicit
and
this
we
suggest
is
exactly
what
stoner
teaches.
i
think
we
would
all
be
shocked
and
reject
out
of
hand
the
notion
that
a
father
could
waive
his
son's
right
to
a
--
to
counsel
in
a
trial
and
submit
him
not
a
plea
of
guilty
of
the
court
for
sentencing.
and
i
don't
think
we
would
accept
a
wife's
asserted
waiver
of
her
husband's
fifth
amendment
rights.
this
situation,
we
submit
is
really
no
different.
in
a
narrow
sense,
it
is
perhaps
not
essential
for
the
disposition
of
this
particular
case
that
the
third-party
consent
issue
be
met
head
on.
this
search
was
unreasonable
by
any
standard
despite
ms.
marshall's
consent.
advert
once
more
to
the
general
rule
that
a
search
warrant
is
required,
except
where
necessity
changes
that
circumstance.
absent
a
warrant,
the
requirement
of
necessity
in
fact
even
though
the
decisions
and
petitioner
fully
appreciates
this,
the
decisions
use
the
word
reasonable
and
unreasonable.
if
the
requirement
of
necessity
is
not
met,
then
the
warrant
is
required.
here,
there
was
no
reason,
no
justification
for
not
either
seeing
a
warrant
or
seeking
the
petitioner's
consent
and
the
failure
to
have
sought
that
consent
in
this
particular
instance
where
he
was
immediately
available
to
give
or
withhold
it,
all
that
sergeant
maloney
had
to
do
was
open
the
door
and
ask
him,
is
what
makes
this
search
unreasonable.
mr.
henry
n.
herndon,
jr.
against
her.
against
her,
no
i
would
not.
mr.
henry
n.
herndon,
jr.
it
was
an
entire
house,
your
honor.
mr.
henry
n.
herndon,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
henry
n.
herndon,
jr.
no,
it
was
not
your
honor.
we
concede
for
purposes
of
this
argument
that
--
mr.
henry
n.
herndon,
jr.
--
both
the
junk
and
the
jacket
which
were
clothing
were
in
commonly
occupied
areas.
mr.
henry
n.
herndon,
jr.
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
henry
n.
herndon,
jr.
well,
i
am
arguing
that.
yes,
i
am
your
honor
because
under
the
circumstances
--
mr.
henry
n.
herndon,
jr.
i'm
arguing
that
that
is
what
makes
the
search
unreasonable
if
the
standard
applicable
and
i
concede
to
not
knowing
what
the
standard
is.
if
the
standard
is
some
general
and
amorphous
thing
which
we're
just
going
to
label
reasonable,
i
say
that
this
search
was
unreasonable
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
in
real
terms,
the
purpose
of
this
search
was
to
get
evidence
against
the
petitioner.
not
against
--
mr.
henry
n.
herndon,
jr.
--
the
consenter.
mr.
henry
n.
herndon,
jr.
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
wouldn't
go
that
far
and
do
not
need
to
in
this
case.
but
i
do
say
that
where
a
is
the
target
of
the
search,
and
a
does
have
a
right
to
be
and
to
have
his
things
where
those
things
are
and
where
he
is
in
his
house
where
he
lives.
then
in
that
context,
i
say
that
his
consent
is
required.
mr.
henry
n.
herndon,
jr.
there
is
none
mr.
henry
n.
herndon,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
henry
n.
herndon,
jr.
i
think
my
answer
was
to
the
question
that
if
she
was
consented
to
a
search,
then
a
search
to
obtain
evidence
against
was
proper.
but
i'll
go
further
to
say
that
if
they
--
if
she
consented
to
their
being
in
the
house,
then
they're
properly
in
the
house.
that's
correct.
mr.
henry
n.
herndon,
jr.
i
say
no.
mr.
henry
n.
herndon,
jr.
i
think
that's
correct.
mr.
henry
n.
herndon,
jr.
no
further
question
that
concludes
my
argument.
mr.
henry
n.
herndon,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
if
i
may
respond
very
briefly.
as
to
the
johnson
argument,
i
think
that
the
position
of
the
state
of
delaware
points
up
the
problem
in
using
the
word
case
as
the
word
of
art,
rather
than
the
word
trial.
the
decisions
in
many
states
vary
as
to
when
a
case
or
indeed
a
trial
begins.
some
cases
say
that
it
begins
with
the
interrogation
of
the
defendant,
others
at
the
time
of
a
preliminary
hearing,
others
at
the
time
of
indictment,
others
at
the
time
of
arraignment
and
pleas,
still
others
when
the
jury
is
called
into
the
box
for
examination
and
still
others
when
the
jury
is
sworn,
so
that
that
problem
has
to
be
faced
as
well.
it
seems
to
us
of
the
use
of
the
word
trial
is
a
clearly
understood
and
well
recognized
word
which
provides
fine
degree
of
definiteness
and
one
that
should
be
easily
followed
despite
the
problems
some
courts
have
had
with
it.
it
is
suggested
that
this
would
punish
the
police
for
what
they
have
done
properly
at
the
time
they
obtained
the
statement.
this
is
necessarily
the
consequence
of
johnson
in
any
case
where
in
no
trial
of
any
type
had
been
started,
unless
the
critical
word
is
case
and
unless
the
case
means
the
time
--
the
time
the
statement
was
taken.
it
was
further
pointed
that
this
punishes
the
police
and
that
there
was
no
anticipation
of
the
problem,
and
it
was
too
late
to
go
out
and
get
any
other
evidence
unless
simply
like
to
advert
to
the
petitioner's
motion
to
suppress
in
this
case,
in
december
of
'65
which
included
the
ground
and
certainly
warned
the
police
at
that
time
some
few
months
after
the
event
that
the
defendant,
this
is
the
quote.
“the
defendant
was
not
adequately
afforded
the
right
to
console
with
legal
counsel,
and
legal
counsel
was
not
assigned
to
represent
the
defendant
prior
to
the
time
as
purported
a
statement
was
obtained,
thereby
depriving
the
defendant
of
his
right
to
counsel.”
so,
there
was
a
warning
at
that
time
that
if
there
was
a
problem
and
if
there
was
further
evidence,
that
was
the
time
we've
then.
as
to
the
search
issue,
i
think
the
--
if
i
was
understood
to
make
the
representation
or
argument
to
the
court
that
in
no
case
can
a
third-party
consent
to
a
search
vis-à-vis
the
defendant,
then
i
didn't
state
it
well
at
all.
what
i
did
say
was
that
where
the
purpose
of
the
search
is
to
obtain
evidence
against
a
defendant,
then
the
consent
of
someone
who
simply
has
a
proprietary
interest
in
the
property
to
be
searched
is
not
sufficient,
and
that
is
my
point.
i
have
some
concern
about
the
--
there
an
aversion
to
some
of
this
in-plain
view
cases.
the
obvious
distinction
there
is
we
don't
have
a
search,
and
thereby
the
problem
doesn't
arise.
mr.
henry
n.
herndon,
jr.
i
have
trouble
with
that
your
honor,
and
i
had
trouble
with
it
because
wonder
whether
or
not
the
robber
at
that
juncture
had
not
in
fact
abandoned
that
by
putting
it
in
some
--
putting
it
--
just
dumping
that
property
in
somebody's
house.
mr.
henry
n.
herndon,
jr.
then,
i
would
--
mr.
henry
n.
herndon,
jr.
that's
what
i
have
said.
mr.
henry
n.
herndon,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
henry
n.
herndon,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
murder
case
in
which
the
defendant's
conviction
of
first
degree
murder
was
reversed
by
the
delaware
supreme
court
for
a
trial
de
novo.
he
was
tried
again
after
this
court's
decision
in
miranda
and
convicted
of
second
degree
murder.
the
delaware
supreme
court
subsequently
entered
a
judgment
affirming
that
conviction,
and
this
court
granted
certiorari
to
review
that
judgment.
two
issues
are
raised
in
this
proceeding.
first,
are
the
standards
of
miranda
applicable
to
all
trials
including
retrials
commenced
after
the
decision
was
announced?
secondly,
does
the
warrantless
search
of
a
suspects
home
based
solely
upon
the
consent
of
his
co-occupant,
violate
the
suspect's
rights
under
the
fourth
amendment
where
he
was
physically
present
and
immediately
to
give
or
withhold
his
consent,
and
where
the
purpose
of
the
search
was
to
obtain
evidence
not
against
his
co-occupant,
but
against
he
suspect
himself?
the
facts
are
not
in
dispute.
indeed,
the
statement
of
the
case
in
the
brief
of
the
respondent
is
identical
to
that
in
the
petitioner's
brief.
the
very
and
very
summary
form
of
the
facts
are
these.
on
the
morning
of
march
17,
1965,
officers
of
the
wilmington,
delaware
police
department
were
called
to
investigate
in
apparent
homicide.
the
victim
was
found
in
a
junkyard.
subsequent
examination
of
the
body
by
an
assistant
medical
examiner
disclosed
that
the
victim
had
died
sometime
the
prior
evening.
the
petitioner
and
a
companion
had
been
observed
on
the
street
in
the
vicinity
of
that
junkyard
on
that
prior
evening.
they
had
been
apprehended
and
taken
to
the
police
station
where
they
were
questioned
by
a
sergeant
maloney
and
subsequently
released.
sergeant
maloney's
name
will
come
again.
between
9
and
10
o'clock
on
the
morning
of
the
march
the
17th,
that
is
the
day
after
the
initial
apprehension.
sergeant
maloney
went
with
four
other
officers
to
the
home
of
the
petitioner.
his
purpose
was
to
see
if
the
petitioner
and
his
companion
of
the
prior
evening
were
there.
the
petitioner's
lady
friend,
ms.
marshall,
answered
the
door
and
sergeant
maloney
indeed
asked
if
thornton
jenkins,
the
petitioner
was
present.
the
petitioner
and
his
companion,
his
lady
friend
and
three
other
persons,
being
all
of
those
present
in
the
house
were
apprehended
at
that
time
and
taken
to
the
detective
division
of
the
police
station.
a
bit
of
geography
might
be
of
assistance
here.
it
seems
that
all
of
the
county
and
municipal
functions
in
the
new
castle,
delaware
are
taking
care
of
in
a
single
building
called
the
public
building,
which
has
at
one
end
the
city
functions
and
at
the
other
end,
its
county
functions.
the
police
station
is
located
in
the
city
end
of
that
public
building.
at
the
police
station,
the
petitioner
was
placed
in
a
so
called
recording
room
located
in
the
detective
division.
at
11
o'clock
that
morning,
he
was
charged
with
night
prowling.
at
11:40
that
morning,
sergeant
maloney,
according
to
his
testimony,
advised
the
petitioner's
lady
friend
of
and
his
words
“her
rights”
and
requested
permission
to
search
the
house.
she
told
him
that
he
could
search
the
house,
which
he
then
did,
discovering
of
junk
and
clothing
which
were
seized
and
later
introduced
into
evidence
at
the
trial.
i'll
return
when
we
come
to
the
subject
of
the
validity
of
this
search
to
some
more
specific
facts
on
that
issue.
now,
later
that
same
afternoon
at
1:15
p.m.,
the
petitioner
was
formally
charged
with
fourth
degree
burglary
and
murder
in
the
first
degree.
subsequently
at
7
p.m.,
an
incriminating
written
statement
was
obtained
from
him.
the
purpose
of
this
confession
was
of
course
to
verify
what
the
police
officers
had
already
concluded,
namely
that
the
petitioner
was
that
person,
or
at
least
one
of
them
who
had
committed
the
homicide
then
under
investigation.
although,
the
evidence
is
conflicting
upon
what
warnings
were
given
to
the
petitioner
and
when
they
were
given
regarding
his
fifth
amendment
rights.
for
the
petitioner
for
example,
insist
that
he
was
not
given
any
warnings
until
after
he
had
signed
the
statement.
it
is
clear
that
he
was
not
advised
of
his
right
to
have
counsel
supplied
to
him
in
the
event
he
wished
and
was
enable
to
afford
counsel.
timely
motions
to
suppress
both
the
products
of
the
search
and
the
statement
were
filed
both
before
and
during
the
trials
and
were
denied.
petitioner's
first
trial
began
in
january
of
1966,
and
his
more
recent
trial
in
october
of
'67.
it
was
the
petitioner's
second
trial
in
october
of
'67
which
poses
the
first
issue
raised
here.
following
his
initial
conviction,
the
delaware
supreme
court
reversed
for
several
reasons,
none
of
them
relating
to
the
petitioner's
statement,
and
in
so
doing
directed
that
although
the
new
trial
was
to
be
de
novo,
the
standards
proscribed
by
miranda
were
not
to
be
applied.
johnson
held
that
miranda
would
apply
only
to
trials
begun
after
that
decision,
namely
miranda,
was
announced.
it
was
not
specifically
concerned
with
and
did
not
expressly
hold
whether
a
retrial
was
among
the
trials
in
which
miranda
was
to
be
applicable.
for
four
major
reasons,
we
submit
that
the
admissibility
of
a
criminal
defendant's
incriminating
statement
at
a
retrial
should
be
measured
by
the
same
gauge
as
any
other
defendant
going
to
trial
at
the
same
time,
very
briefly,
those
reasons
are
these.
first,
the
purpose
of
the
miranda
rule
is
to
enhance
the
reliability
of
the
fact
finding
process
at
trial.
now,
that
purpose
could
not
be
fully
implemented
if
it
were
applicable
only
to
some
trials.
now
here,
we
think
that
the
contrasting
treatment
in
stovall
of
the
way
gilbert
rules
is
enlightening.
there
of
course,
the
critical
time
was
fixed
as
the
time
of
the
confrontation.
the
time
when
the
identification
took
place.
here,
the
time
was
fixed
at
trial.
similarly,
in
this
court's
recent
decision
in
fuller
versus
alaska
announcing
the
applicability
of
the
lee
versus
florida
rule,
once
again,
the
time
was
fixed.
not
the
time
that
the
officers
obtained
the
evidence
in
violation
of
section
605
of
the
federal
communication
act,
but
at
the
time
of
trial
and
once
again
however,
no
distinction
being
made
as
to
the
types
of
trial.
but
certainly
would
seem
that
if
the
rule
in
lee
versus
florida,
which
--
in
which
--
as
to
which
the
court
said
that
it
doesn't
go
to
the
enhancement
of
the
fact
finding
process.
the
trial
is
going
to
be
applicable
at
trials
subsequent
to
the
time
that
decision
was
announced.
it
would
seem
anomalous
to
not
apply
at
least
in
the
retrial
context,
a
rule
which
does
to
the
core
of
the
fact
finding
process.
second,
our
second
reason
is
this,
in
fixing
the
extent
to
which
there
maybe
full
effectuation
of
the
individual's
fifth
amendment
rights
at
trial,
the
results
of
his
prior
in-custody
interrogation
may
and
frequently
are
determinative.
it
is
difficult
if
not
impossible
to
distinguish
between
the
exercise
of
those
rights
during
an
in-custody
interrogation
and
during
trial,
to
the
extent
they
have
been
lost
in
the
interrogation
process
they
can
not
be
fully
exercised
at
trial.
the
choice
of
whether
or
not
to
testify
may
then
not
be
as
a
practical
matter,
one
which
is
open
to
the
defendant.
third
reason
is
this,
there
is
a
seeming
impairment
of
judicial
integrity
in
sanctioning
the
simultaneous
trials
of
different
persons
in
adjoining
courts
but
by
different
standards
and
perhaps,
it
is
reading
too
much
into
johnson,
but
it
appears
to
have
as
one
of
its
purposes
the
implementation
of
the
miranda's
protections
as
soon
as
possible,
but
at
the
same
time
minimizing
any
disruptive
effects
which
would
be
caused
by
its
application.
that
there
would
be
some
disruption
is
apparent,
because
johnson
would
not
exclude
or
would
exclude
from
evidence
that
those
confessions
which
were
obtained
either
prior
to
the
announcement
of
miranda,
or
indeed
after,
ff
they
were
in
compliance
with
miranda
standards
provided
that
no
trial
of
any
kind
had
been
commenced
by
that
date.
and
fourth,
there
is
an
obvious
point
and
perhaps
too
obvious
that
where
johnson
uses
the
words
trials,
that's
exactly
what
was
meant,
and
no
exclusion
of
all
trials,
except
a
defendant's
first
appearance
at
the
bar
was
intended.
most
of
the
decision
which
are
cited
in
all
of
the
briefs,
including
that
of
the
amicus
attorney
general
state
of
new
york,
on
that
or
supporting
the
decision
or
in
accord
with
the
decision
of
the
delaware
supreme
court
in
this
case,
pick
the
critical
word
as
cases.
and
what
they
have
done
with
this
word
is
sometimes
very
interesting.
for
example,
in
the
case
of
boone
versus
state,
i
take
that
in
that
correction,
state
versus
branch,
a
north
carolina
decision
and
the
court
there
found
that
the
word
case
was
determinative
and
how
that
a
case
begins
at
the
time
of
the
in-custody
interrogation.
and
i
suggest
that
that
gives
substantial
warping
to
the
johnson
decision.
i'd
like
to
make
one
or
two
brief
comments
upon
the
brief
of
the
amicus
curiae.
first
he
urged
that
--
the
amicus
urges
that
the
new
york
courts
have
relied
upon
the
non-applicability
of
miranda
in
reversing
subsequent
cases.
we
would
suggest
that
the
cases
were
reversed
because
they
had
either
been
wrongly
decided
or
for
some
other
error
committed
during
the
course
at
trial.
secondly,
it's
argued
that
miranda
should
not,
and
i'm
quoting,
“be
applied
to
past
convictions
merely
because
a
retrial
is
ordered.”
i
would
suggest
that
if
a
retrial
is
ordered,
there
is
no
past
conviction
but
only
a
future
trial.
finally,
the
amicus
contends
that
the
primary
aim
of
miranda
was
to
change
the
circumstances
of
interrogation.
i
would
suggest
that
that
simply
is
not
what
--
that
is
one
of
the
purposes,
but
is
not
the
primary
purpose.
we
turn
now
to
the
search
and
seizure
question.
and
there,
i
think
some
additional
facts
maybe
of
assistance.
the
petitioner
and
his
lady
friend,
leona
marshall,
had
lived
together
as
man
and
wife
for
about
three
or
four
years
prior
to
his
arrest.
they
had
lived
in
the
house
where
the
petitioner
was
apprehended
for
a
period
of
anywhere
from,
according
to
here
testimony,
two
of
those
years
to
perhaps
nine
months
according
to
the
landlord.
between
9
and
10
o'clock
on
the
morning
of
march
17,
some
five
officers
of
the
wilmington
police
department
went
to
the
petitioner's
home
to
apprehend
the
petitioner
and
his
companion
of
the
prior
evening.
sergeant
maloney
knocked
on
the
front
door,
ms.
marshall
still
dressed
in
a
house
coat,
answered
the
door.
sergeant
maloney
asked
for
the
petitioner.
the
people
in
the
house
were
then
collected
in
one
of
the
rooms,
which
i
think
sergeant
maloney
described
as
a
dining
room,
where
ms.
marshall
observed
the
petitioner's
companion
being
directed
to
lean
against
the
wall
and
being
patted
down.
she
was
told
to
get
some
clothes
on
and
testified
if
she
was
advised
that
the
people
in
the
house
were
going
downtown.
they
were
taken
in
to
police
station.
all
of
those
apprehended,
except
for
the
petitioners
and
his
companion,
were
seated
on
a
bench
immediately
outside
the
detective
division
portion
of
the
police
station.
the
petitioner
was
taken
inside
and
placed
in
a
so
called
recording
room,
which
is
a
separate
room
within
the
larger
confine
of
the
detective
division.
sergeant
maloney
thereafter
sought
ms.
marshall's
permission
to
search
the
house.
the
record
is
clear
that
at
that
time,
sergeant
maloney
had
ms.
marshall
in
custody.
he
knew
that
the
petitioner
lived
at
the
house
to
be
search.
he
knew
that
the
petitioner
was
one
of
the
two
prime
suspects
in
the
homicide
investigation
then
being
conducted.
he
knew
that
the
petitioner
was
present
in
the
recording
room.
he
proposed
to
conduct
the
search
to
obtain
evidence
of
the
petitioner's
guilt
to
the
homicide,
and
he
made
no
effort
whatsoever
to
obtain
the
petitioner's
consent
to
the
search.
for
her
part,
ms.
marshall
had
a
limited
comprehension
of
what
the
search
was
all
about
and
what
her
rights
were.
basically,
she
testified
that
she
just
didn't
know
what
it
was
all
about
because
the
police
didn't
tell
her.
she
didn't
know
that
she
was
not
required
to
permit
a
search.
she
thought
the
police
could
the
property
simply
because
they
wanted
to,
and
i
think
it's
--
i
should
say
to
that
she
assumed
that
they
could
just
get
a
search
warrant
by
some
process
that
she
didn't
understand,
but
that
they
could
get
one.
but
any
event,
as
a
result,
she
did
permit
the
search
for
no
reason
really
other
than
the
police
asked
here
to.
the
search
therefore
was
without
a
warrant
and
was
not
conducted
incident
to
a
lawful
arrest.
the
sole
basis
for
its
legitimacy
was
the
acquiescence
of
ms.
marshall,
petitioner's
co-occupant
in
the
request
of
the
police
for
permission
to
search
and
that
--
mr.
henry
n.
herndon,
jr.
the
testimony
of
the
landlord
says
that
as
far
as
he
was
concerned,
she
was
the
only
tenant
of
the
property.
the
delaware
supreme
court
in
its
first
opinion
so
held.
the
evidence
also
discloses,
mr.
justice
fortas
that
the
rent
money
came
from
the
petitioner,
if
that's
significant.
mr.
henry
n.
herndon,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
it
was.
it
was
raised
in
both
appeals.
the
opinion
--
mr.
henry
n.
herndon,
jr.
yes
your
honor,
it
does
in
the
--
it
points
out
that
the
petitioner
raises
for
the
record
the
same
issues
at
pages
101
and
102
--
mr.
henry
n.
herndon,
jr.
--
record
purposes.
these
--
both
these
points
had
been
dealt
with
at
the
first
trial
and
had
been
rejected
in
the
first
appeal
by
the
delaware
supreme
court.
the
acquiescence
of
ms.
marshall,
we
suggest,
does
not
measure
up
to
the
requirements
of
the
fourth
amendment
for
two
basic
reasons.
first
of
all,
her
positive
response
to
the
request
for
permission
of
search
was
not
made
with
any
real
comprehension
of
what
her
fourth
amendment
rights
were.
and
second,
irrespective
of
whether
ms.
marshall's
permission
to
search
effectively
waived
her
own
rights.
we
submit
that
she
could
not
waive
the
petitioner's
rights,
and
even
if
it
is
assumed
that
if
that
a
co-occupant
simply
because
he
is
a
co-occupant,
can
waive
another's
fourth
amendment
protections.
the
search
here
was
nevertheless
unreasonable
where
it
was
the
petitioner,
who
was
the
prime
murder
suspect,
where
it
was
him
against
whom
evidence
was
being
sought
and
where
he
was
immediately
available
to
give
her
with
all
that
consent.
common
to
both
reasons
is
a
precept
that
a
warrantless
search
is
in
violation
of
the
constitution,
unless
it
can
be
demonstrated
as
being
within
one
of
the
well
defined
exceptions
to
the
general
requirement
that
a
search
must
rest
upon
a
search
warrant.
necessity
may
justify
a
search
in
certain
circumstances.
but
absent
necessity,
a
warrantless
search
must
be
supported
by
valid
consent,
as
to
the
first
reasons,
the
insufficiency
of
ms.
marshall's
consent.
like
the
fifth
amendment,
the
fourth
--
the
aim
of
the
fourth
is
in
part
certainly
to
avoid
any
compulsion
upon
the
individual
to
incriminate
him
self.
evidence
of
a
suspected
crime
whether
from
the
suspect's
own
mouth
or
whether
from
his
possessions
or
his
home
have
the
same
result.
if
a
waiver
of
this
right
is
to
be
relied
upon,
then
there
does
not
appear
to
be
any
justification
for
surrounding
that
right
with
a
lesser
degree
of
protection
then
is
the
case
for
the
fifth
amendment.
and
thus,
if
a
waiver
is
to
be
relied
upon,
it
must
be
established
that
ms.
marshall
fully
comprehended
what
her
rights
were
before
her
consent
to
the
search
can
be
characterized
as
effective
to
support
the
search.
and
the
burden
here
of
establishing
that
waiver
is
upon
the
state.
in
this
case,
we
submit
that
the
burden
has
not
been
sustained.
as
to
the
second
reason,
as
far
as
petitioner
is
aware,
this
court
has
never
upheld
the
validity
of
a
third-party
consent
to
a
search
--
let
me
state
that
in
other
way.
as
far
as
the
petitioner
is
aware,
this
court
has
never
specifically
held
that
a
third-party
effectively
waived
the
fourth
amendment
rights
of
a
defendant.
once
it
is
recognized
that
the
fourth
amendment
protects
people
and
not
simply
places
or
things,
and
that
the
rights
of
the
individual
are
personal
rights,
then
it
is
difficult
to
accept
that
those
rights
may
be
dismembered
by
one
who
has
absolutely
no
interest
in
their
protection.
anything
else
such
as
the
possession
and
control
rule
relied
upon
the
delaware
courts
and
many
of
the
lower
courts,
necessarily
--
lower
federal
courts
--
necessarily
involves
an
analysis
of
relative
and
competing
property
interests,
and
makes
them
determinative
of
who
can
consent
to
the
search.
the
waiver
therefore
must
be
by
the
person
whose
rights
are
involved.
either
he
must
waive
it
in
person
or
through
an
agent.
but
in
either
case,
the
waiver
or
authority
to
waive
must
be
explicit
and
this
we
suggest
is
exactly
what
stoner
teaches.
i
think
we
would
all
be
shocked
and
reject
out
of
hand
the
notion
that
a
father
could
waive
his
son's
right
to
a
--
to
counsel
in
a
trial
and
submit
him
not
a
plea
of
guilty
of
the
court
for
sentencing.
and
i
don't
think
we
would
accept
a
wife's
asserted
waiver
of
her
husband's
fifth
amendment
rights.
this
situation,
we
submit
is
really
no
different.
in
a
narrow
sense,
it
is
perhaps
not
essential
for
the
disposition
of
this
particular
case
that
the
third-party
consent
issue
be
met
head
on.
this
search
was
unreasonable
by
any
standard
despite
ms.
marshall's
consent.
advert
once
more
to
the
general
rule
that
a
search
warrant
is
required,
except
where
necessity
changes
that
circumstance.
absent
a
warrant,
the
requirement
of
necessity
in
fact
even
though
the
decisions
and
petitioner
fully
appreciates
this,
the
decisions
use
the
word
reasonable
and
unreasonable.
if
the
requirement
of
necessity
is
not
met,
then
the
warrant
is
required.
here,
there
was
no
reason,
no
justification
for
not
either
seeing
a
warrant
or
seeking
the
petitioner's
consent
and
the
failure
to
have
sought
that
consent
in
this
particular
instance
where
he
was
immediately
available
to
give
or
withhold
it,
all
that
sergeant
maloney
had
to
do
was
open
the
door
and
ask
him,
is
what
makes
this
search
unreasonable.
mr.
henry
n.
herndon,
jr.
against
her.
against
her,
no
i
would
not.
mr.
henry
n.
herndon,
jr.
it
was
an
entire
house,
your
honor.
mr.
henry
n.
herndon,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
henry
n.
herndon,
jr.
no,
it
was
not
your
honor.
we
concede
for
purposes
of
this
argument
that
--
mr.
henry
n.
herndon,
jr.
--
both
the
junk
and
the
jacket
which
were
clothing
were
in
commonly
occupied
areas.
mr.
henry
n.
herndon,
jr.
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
henry
n.
herndon,
jr.
well,
i
am
arguing
that.
yes,
i
am
your
honor
because
under
the
circumstances
--
mr.
henry
n.
herndon,
jr.
i'm
arguing
that
that
is
what
makes
the
search
unreasonable
if
the
standard
applicable
and
i
concede
to
not
knowing
what
the
standard
is.
if
the
standard
is
some
general
and
amorphous
thing
which
we're
just
going
to
label
reasonable,
i
say
that
this
search
was
unreasonable
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
in
real
terms,
the
purpose
of
this
search
was
to
get
evidence
against
the
petitioner.
not
against
--
mr.
henry
n.
herndon,
jr.
--
the
consenter.
mr.
henry
n.
herndon,
jr.
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
wouldn't
go
that
far
and
do
not
need
to
in
this
case.
but
i
do
say
that
where
a
is
the
target
of
the
search,
and
a
does
have
a
right
to
be
and
to
have
his
things
where
those
things
are
and
where
he
is
in
his
house
where
he
lives.
then
in
that
context,
i
say
that
his
consent
is
required.
mr.
henry
n.
herndon,
jr.
there
is
none
mr.
henry
n.
herndon,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
henry
n.
herndon,
jr.
i
think
my
answer
was
to
the
question
that
if
she
was
consented
to
a
search,
then
a
search
to
obtain
evidence
against
was
proper.
but
i'll
go
further
to
say
that
if
they
--
if
she
consented
to
their
being
in
the
house,
then
they're
properly
in
the
house.
that's
correct.
mr.
henry
n.
herndon,
jr.
i
say
no.
mr.
henry
n.
herndon,
jr.
i
think
that's
correct.
mr.
henry
n.
herndon,
jr.
no
further
question
that
concludes
my
argument.
mr.
henry
n.
herndon,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
if
i
may
respond
very
briefly.
as
to
the
johnson
argument,
i
think
that
the
position
of
the
state
of
delaware
points
up
the
problem
in
using
the
word
case
as
the
word
of
art,
rather
than
the
word
trial.
the
decisions
in
many
states
vary
as
to
when
a
case
or
indeed
a
trial
begins.
some
cases
say
that
it
begins
with
the
interrogation
of
the
defendant,
others
at
the
time
of
a
preliminary
hearing,
others
at
the
time
of
indictment,
others
at
the
time
of
arraignment
and
pleas,
still
others
when
the
jury
is
called
into
the
box
for
examination
and
still
others
when
the
jury
is
sworn,
so
that
that
problem
has
to
be
faced
as
well.
it
seems
to
us
of
the
use
of
the
word
trial
is
a
clearly
understood
and
well
recognized
word
which
provides
fine
degree
of
definiteness
and
one
that
should
be
easily
followed
despite
the
problems
some
courts
have
had
with
it.
it
is
suggested
that
this
would
punish
the
police
for
what
they
have
done
properly
at
the
time
they
obtained
the
statement.
this
is
necessarily
the
consequence
of
johnson
in
any
case
where
in
no
trial
of
any
type
had
been
started,
unless
the
critical
word
is
case
and
unless
the
case
means
the
time
--
the
time
the
statement
was
taken.
it
was
further
pointed
that
this
punishes
the
police
and
that
there
was
no
anticipation
of
the
problem,
and
it
was
too
late
to
go
out
and
get
any
other
evidence
unless
simply
like
to
advert
to
the
petitioner's
motion
to
suppress
in
this
case,
in
december
of
'65
which
included
the
ground
and
certainly
warned
the
police
at
that
time
some
few
months
after
the
event
that
the
defendant,
this
is
the
quote.
“the
defendant
was
not
adequately
afforded
the
right
to
console
with
legal
counsel,
and
legal
counsel
was
not
assigned
to
represent
the
defendant
prior
to
the
time
as
purported
a
statement
was
obtained,
thereby
depriving
the
defendant
of
his
right
to
counsel.”
so,
there
was
a
warning
at
that
time
that
if
there
was
a
problem
and
if
there
was
further
evidence,
that
was
the
time
we've
then.
as
to
the
search
issue,
i
think
the
--
if
i
was
understood
to
make
the
representation
or
argument
to
the
court
that
in
no
case
can
a
third-party
consent
to
a
search
vis-à-vis
the
defendant,
then
i
didn't
state
it
well
at
all.
what
i
did
say
was
that
where
the
purpose
of
the
search
is
to
obtain
evidence
against
a
defendant,
then
the
consent
of
someone
who
simply
has
a
proprietary
interest
in
the
property
to
be
searched
is
not
sufficient,
and
that
is
my
point.
i
have
some
concern
about
the
--
there
an
aversion
to
some
of
this
in-plain
view
cases.
the
obvious
distinction
there
is
we
don't
have
a
search,
and
thereby
the
problem
doesn't
arise.
mr.
henry
n.
herndon,
jr.
i
have
trouble
with
that
your
honor,
and
i
had
trouble
with
it
because
wonder
whether
or
not
the
robber
at
that
juncture
had
not
in
fact
abandoned
that
by
putting
it
in
some
--
putting
it
--
just
dumping
that
property
in
somebody's
house.
mr.
henry
n.
herndon,
jr.
then,
i
would
--
mr.
henry
n.
herndon,
jr.
that's
what
i
have
said.
mr.
henry
n.
herndon,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
