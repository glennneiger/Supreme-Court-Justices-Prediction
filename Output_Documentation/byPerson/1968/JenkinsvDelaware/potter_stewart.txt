justice
potter
stewart
was
the
dorothy
in
the
california
supreme
court
decided
before
or
after
this
court's
decision
in
stolov?
justice
potter
stewart
i
haven't
read
all
these
cases
in
your,
or
really
any
of
these
cases
in
your
footnotes
10,
11
and
12.
but
just
a
cursory
glance
at
the
dates
of
the
cases
would
indicate
to
me,
and
perhaps
i'm
wrong,
i've
just
--
that's
all
i've
done
is
glance
at
the
date,
would
indicate
that
perhaps
more
courts
held
that
miranda
to
be
applicable
to
a
new
trial
before
this
court's
decision
in
stovol,
and
did
so
afterwards?
justice
potter
stewart
also
in
'67
my
recollection
is.
justice
potter
stewart
you
don't
remember
whether
the
california
supreme
court
discusses
the
stovol
case
in
its
opinion
i
think
it
add
the
date
in
the
stovol
decision,
but
that's
not
what
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
in
your
--
then
you
would
contend
that
to
take
your
adversary's
hypothetical
case
that
a
robber
who
stashed
away
stolen
goods
in
an
empty
house
in
a
summer
resort
and
left,
and
that
the
owner
of
that
house
could
not
consent
to
the
search
of
the
house
because
the
object
would
be
to
get
evidence
against
the
robber.
so,
you
would
say
that
he
could
not
give
consent
to
the
search
of
his
--
that
the
anything
found
is
resulted
to
his
consent
to
the
search
for
his
own
house
could
not
be
used
against
the
robber,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
what
i
understood
you
to
say
just
now
was
that
somebody
with
a
propriety
interest
in
a
house
could
not
give
consent
to
a
search
if
the
purpose,
and
object,
and
target
of
the
search
was
to
get
evidence
somebody
else?
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
what
you
said?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that
would
cover
the
summer
house
case,
wouldn't
it?
