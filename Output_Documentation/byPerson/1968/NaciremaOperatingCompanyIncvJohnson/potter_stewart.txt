stewart
didn't
the
deputy
commissioner
make
an
award
in
that
case
with
that?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
what
i
thought.
he
made
that
precise
distinction?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
precise
distinction
is
made
by
the
cases
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well
i
thought
i
read
the
briefs
the
deputy
commissioner
had
unlike
these
other
cases?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
because
that's
not
before
us,
but
i
thought
i
read
in
the
briefs
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
or
a
footnote
somewhere
that
the
deputy
commissioner
had
made
that
precise
distinction?
justice
potter
stewart
for
the
man
knocked
into
the
water
and
drowned
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
but
you
rather
slipped
over
a
rather
key
phrase
that
is
on
navigable
waters.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
coleman,
the
so
called
appeal
that's
a
district
court
proceeding
from
the
deputy
commissioner?
justice
potter
stewart
and
what
practical
difference,
if
any
does
it
make
whether
it's
denominated
on
the
admiralty
side
or
the
civil
side.
justice
potter
stewart
it
would
be
against
the
ship
owner?
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
the
ship
owner?
justice
potter
stewart
it
could
be
for
unseaworthiness
or
--
justice
potter
stewart
how
is
that
--
how
do
you
suppose
a
ship
gets
into
a
dry
dock
if
it's
on
land?
justice
potter
stewart
i
served
about
four
years
at
sea
and
i
never
saw
a
dry
dock
that
is
built
on
dry
land.
