mr.
randall
c.
coleman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issues
before
the
court
today
are
whether
pier
injuries
to
longshoreman
are
injuries
which
occurred
on
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states
and
are
thus
within
the
coverage
of
the
longshoreman's
act.
that
question
was
answered
in
the
affirmative
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit,
and
therefore
as
one
of
the
reasons
that
the
fourth
circuit
decided
the
case
affirmatively
was
that
the
admiralty
extension
act
broadened
and
expanded
the
coverage
of
the
longshoreman's
act.
the
court
will
also
have
before
it
the
admiralty
extension
act
and
whether
or
not
it
did
in
fact
extend
the
coverage
to
the
longshoreman's
act.
the
facts
in
the
case
are
undisputed
and
i
will
give
them,
your
honors
together
with
the
history
of
the
case.
these
consolidated
cases
arose
from
pier
injuries
to
three
longshoremen.
one
of
the
injuries
resulted
in
the
death
of
the
longshoreman.
the
cases
arose,
two
of
them,
william
johnson
and
joseph
klosek
arose
in
maryland
and
one
albert
avery
arose
in
virginia.
they
were
pier
injuries
under
virtually
identical
circumstances
because
all
three
of
the
longshoremen
involved
were,
what
is
known
as
slingers.
they
worked
and
were
working
at
the
time
of
the
injuries
in
gondola
cars
on
piers.
they
were
slinging
on
cargo
which
was
attached
to
ships'
falls
or
cables
which
then
loaded
the
cargo
which
was
being
slung
on
to
the
vessel.
the
piers
in
the
--
well
the
pier
in
the
maryland
case
was
on
the
patapsco
river.
it
extended
out
into
that
river
approximately
600
feet,
i
believe,
and
there's
no
question
that
the
patapsco
river
is
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states.
the
pier
in
the
virginia
case,
city
piers
of
north
of
virginia
extended
i
think
about
a
thousand
feet
into
the
elizabeth
river.
there's
also
no
dispute
that
the
elizabeth
river
is
on
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states.
it
was
found
as
a
fact
and
not
disputed
that
these
longshoremen
in
both
cases
might
have
been
working
on
the
pier
at
one
time.
they
might
also
have
gone
aboard
the
vessel.
they
sometimes
switched
positions.
it
is
also
found
as
a
fact
and
undisputed
that
these
particular
piers
were
piers
which
were
erected
on
pilings.
and
certain
small
craft
could
get
under
them,
and
i
think
canoes
and
rowboats
were
named.
large
vessels
could
not
because
the
piers
instructed
them.
the
deputy
commissioner
oosting
in
virginia
and
deputy
commissioner
traynor
in
maryland
both
found
that
the
injuries
to
these
men
which
resulted
when
cargo
swung
against
the
men,
in
the
case
of
joseph
klosek,
he
was
knocked
out
off
the
gondola
car
to
the
dock
and
sustained
fatal
injuries.
the
other
two
men
johnson
and
avery
were
pinned
against
the
side
of
the
railroad
car.
the
deputy
commissioner
found
that
those
injuries,
both
deputy
commissioners,
found
that
those
injuries
were
injuries
which
did
not
occur
upon
navigable
waters.
the
opinions
of
both
the
deputy
commissioners
were
then
appealed
to
the
district
courts
first
to
the
eastern
district
of
virginia
and
to
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
maryland.
and
the
district
judges,
judge
hoffman
from
the
eastern
district
of
virginia,
judge
watkins
from
the
district
of
maryland
affirmed
the
findings
of
the
deputy
commissioner.
the
cases
were
then
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit.
they
were
first,
the
avery
case
and
the
johnson
and
klosek
cases
were
first
argued
in
separate
panels,
and
after
that
they
were
consolidated
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit
en
banc
heard
all
three
cases.
they
reversed
the
two
district
judges.
certiorari
was
applied
for
by
the
nacirema
operating
company
in
the
maryland
case
by
liberty
mutual
insurance
company
in
the
virginia
case,
and
by
solicitor
general
on
behalf
of
the
two
deputy
commissioners
and
with
us
before
the
court.
the
principal
point
upon
which
i
rely
is
that
for
some
years,
the
piers
have
been
considered
extensions
of
the
land.
i
believe
that
was
the
law
some
time
ago
and
is
presently
the
law.
the
point
was
never
mentioned
by
the
court
of
appeals
below
and
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
might
have
had
somewhat
difficult
time
answering
the
question.
a
number
of
cases
from
this
court
were
cited,
they
were
on
page
10
of
our
briefs.
the
most
recent
that
i
can
think
of,
of
this
court
is
the
opinion
announced
by
mr.
justice
black
in
swanson
against
marra
brothers
which
i
think
is
certainly
still
the
law,
it
certainly
the
most
well
known
case.
i
will
only
quote
that
portion
of
the
opinion
which
relates
to
this
point.
“swanson
was
a
longshoreman
who
was
injured
on
the
pier
when
a
life
raft
fell
from
the
ship
and
injured
him.”
and
this
court
said
without
dissent,
but
since
the
act,
that's
the
longshoreman's
act,
is
restricted
to
compensation
for
injuries
occurring
on
navigable
waters,
it
excludes
from
its
own
terms
and
from
the
jones
act,
any
remedies
against
the
employer
for
injuries
inflicted
on
shore.
the
act
leaves
the
injured
employees
in
such
cases
to
pursue
the
remedies
afforded
by
local
law.
the
court
then
and
prior
to
that
had
always
considered
pier
injuries
to
be
shore
injuries,
and
i
submit
your
honors
that
that
is
still
the
law.
the
court,
this
court
has
always
followed
i
believe,
the
line
of
demarcation
which
was
set
out
in
the
jensen
case
years
ago,
and
that
line
is
the
line
between
state
and
federal
coverage.
and
specifically
it's
the
line
between
navigable
waters
and
land,
or
extensions
of
the
land.
i
think
that
has
always
been
the
law.
so
far
as
i
know,
there
has
never
been
a
decision,
except
that
of
the
fourth
circuit
which
disputes
that
pier
injuries
are
considered
as
land
injuries.
the
injuries
in
this
instance,
all
having
occurred
on
the
pier
don't
fall
within
the
stated
exception
of
the
act,
which
is
any
dry
dock.
dry
docks
were
explained
and
detailed
as
to
what
they
were
by
mr.
justice
douglas
in
avondale
marine
ways
against
henderson
i
think.
and
it
was
clearly
pointed
out
that
the
types
of
dry
dock
referred
to
are
not
wharfs
or
piers,
as
they
were
in
this
instance.
the
case
does
not
--
the
injuries
do
not
fall
within
the
court's
exception
which
was
in
mr.
justice
black's
decision
in
davis
against
the
department
of
labor
in
the
twilight
zone.
the
twilight
zone
as
i
understand
it
is
that
sort
of
hazy
area
between
the
ship
and
the
pier
where
it's
difficult
to
determine
which
coverage
does
apply.
and
the
court
in
the
twilight
zone
cases
has
held
that
there
may
be
both
state
and
federal
coverage
and
the
injured
longshoreman
may
elect.
the
case
most
heavily
relied
upon
by
the
court
below
was
calbeck
against
travelers
insurance
company.
i
hope
since
it
was
discussed
at
some
length
that
this
court
won't
consider
it
presumptions
of
me,
in
particularly
mr.
justice
brennan
to
try
to
state
what
i
think
that
case
held.
i
do
not
think
that
the
case
held
as
the
court
of
appeals
below
said
it
held
that
pier
injuries
could
be
covered
by
the
longshoreman's
act.
that
was
a
case
your
honors
will
recall
which
involved
two
or
more
shipyard
workers
who
were
injured
aboard
ships
which
were
on
navigable
waters
under
new
construction.
they
were
ships
under
construction.
now
the
court
had
before
it,
its
prior
holding
in
1922
of
grant
smith-porter
ship
company
against
rohde,
and
that
case
long
ago
had
established
that
there
was
a
local
concern
in
navigable
--
in
ships
that
were
under
construction
in
navigable
waters.
and
where
there
were
such
local
concern
that
the
state
compensation
acts
could
apply
that
there
and
in
that
instance
the
state
acts
may
apply
and
federal
coverage
did
not
come
into
effect.
now,
i
gathered
from
mr.
justice
brennan's
opinion
that
this
court
was
very
much
concerned
with
whether
or
not
in
all
the
cases
where
there
was
local
concern,
and
particularly
in
the
very
case
it
was
before
it
there
would
definitely
be
coverage
for
longshoremen
who
were
injured.
there
was
the
fear,
i
got
from
the
opinion
there
was
the
fear
that
there
might
not
be
state
or
federal
coverage
somewhere
for
those
men
who
were
working
in
areas
that
the
pre-1927
decisions
had
set
aside
as
local
concern
areas.
so
the
court
in
reversing
the
fifth
circuit,
i
believe
it
was
the
fifth
circuit,
in
reversing
the
fifth
circuit
held
that
what
this
act
meant
was
precisely
what
it
said.
it
wanted
to
cover
injuries
which
occurred
to
longshoreman
on
navigable
waters.
it
didn't
mean
all
injuries.
it
meant
injuries
on
navigable
waters.
there
was
no
dispute
that
there
is
no
dispute.
there
can
be
no
dispute
that
ships
under
construction
just
as
much
as
ships
that
have
been
built
are
on
navigable
waters
if
they
are
afloat
or
in
a
dry
dock
or
a
marine
railway.
mr.
randall
c.
coleman
no
sir,
not
--
mr.
randall
c.
coleman
your
honor
that
was
a
case
that
was
not
brought
up
on
certiorari.
mr.
randall
c.
coleman
there
were
two
men
in
norfolk,
i
can't
recall
the
other
man's
name,
but
you're
quite
right.
mr.
randall
c.
coleman
one
was
knocked
off.
mr.
randall
c.
coleman
your
honor,
to
me
it
makes
a
difference
in
that
--
well,
i
felt
too
that
that
man
was
injured
on
navigable
waters.
i
think
this
is
totally
situs-oriented
and
that
a
man
who
sustains
his
injury
in
the
ocean,
or
in
the
river,
in
the
water
is
clearly
on
navigable
waters.
mr.
randall
c.
coleman
i
suppose.
i
suppose
whenever
you
draw
a
line,
it's
a
difficult
line
to
draw,
yes
sir.
mr.
randall
c.
coleman
this
--
well
let's
see.
in
each
instance
particularly
--
well
i
know
in
the
maryland
case,
there
was
a
derrick
or
crane
on
a
ship
and
from
that
derrick
or
crane,
the
line
descended
to
the
gondola
car
and
hoisted
the
steel
beams,
that
was
the
same
was
true
--
mr.
randall
c.
coleman
yes,
sir.
mr.
randall
c.
coleman
that's
exactly
it,
your
honor.
i
know
--
i
recognize
--
i
can't
dispute
that
incongruities
are
going
to
develop
wherever
line
is
drawn.
mr.
randall
c.
coleman
oh
yes.
mr.
randall
c.
coleman
yes.
mr.
randall
c.
coleman
yes,
sir.
mr.
randall
c.
coleman
no
wait.
i'm
not
sure
the
deputy
commissioner
did
your
honor.
i
know
the
court
of
appeals
held
--
mr.
randall
c.
coleman
i
believe
the
deputy
--
that's
right,
it
did
uphold
the
award
in
that
case.
i
haven't
born
that
one
as
closely
that
--
mr.
randall
c.
coleman
i
believe
--
mr.
randall
c.
coleman
yes,
sir.
mr.
randall
c.
coleman
the
injury
occurred
on
the
ship
your
honor.
that
case
was
covered
by
this
court,
the
admiral
peoples
is
the
same
idea
as
the
--
it
happened
to
be
the
gangway
in
that
case.
mr.
randall
c.
coleman
your
honor,
again
you're
hitting
me
right
where
that
line
is
drawn
and
it's
tough.
mr.
randall
c.
coleman
sir?
mr.
randall
c.
coleman
no
sir,
i
can't
give
the
line
up.
but
all
that
the
court
of
appeals
has
done
below
is
it
just
redrawn
the
line.
it's
just
a
question
of
where
you
are
going
to
draw
it.
wherever
its
drawn,
somebody
on
the
other
side
of
it
whose
agreed
is
going
to
be
nudging
and
say
“i
ought
to
be
on
that
side
of
it.”
and
i
think
that
this
is
a
clearly
established
line.
i
honestly
think
it's
a
logical
line
to
draw
that
is
navigable
waters.
it
was
drawn
by
this
court
for
constitutional
reasons,
navigable
waters
and
the
land.
now,
there
are
a
number
of
examples
that
show
what
might
happen
if
it
were
extended
further
shoreward.
they
might
sound
farfetched,
but
they're
not
farfetched
if
the
court
adopts
the
status
approach
that
was
adopted
by
the
fourth
circuit,
anytime
the
status
approached
--
approach
is
adopted,
it's
going
to
be
extremely
difficult
to
tell
what
to
do
about
that
line.
but
if
a
clear
situs
approach
is
adopted,
you
know
if
it
happened
on
navigable
waters.
it
was
covered
by
this
act.
if
it
happened
on
land
or
extensions
of
land,
it's
covered
by
the
state
act.
the
court
in
calbeck
went
on
to
point
out
that
the
pre-1927
decisions
which
has
been
referred
to
in
the
respondent's
brief
as
static
decisions
where
we
should
not
freeze
the
line,
were
those
very
decisions
of
local
concern,
so
i
--
and
it
was
brought
out
in
the
calbeck
case
just
as
it
was
brought
out
in
the
parker
against
motor
boat
sales
before
it,
that
the
local
concern
doctrine
was
said
to
have
been
read
out
of
the
act.
and
that
it
simply
means
that
where
there
are
navigable
waters,
and
the
court
used
to
term
navigable
waters
frequently,
where
there
are
navigable
waters,
that
is
where
the
federal
act
applies.
the
court
also
recognized
in
the
calbeck
case
the
jensen
line
of
demarcation.
it
had
recognized
it
in
previous
cases.
the
court
cited
in
the
calbeck
case,
the
fifth
circuit
case
of
debardelen
which
quoted
that
congress
intended
to
exercise
to
the
fullest
extent
its
power
to
act
in
this
area.
the
fullest
extent
was
determined
by
the
court
sometime
ago
to
be
where
there
are
navigable
waters
and
apart
from
land
or
extensions
of
land
which
were
then
the
domain
of
the
state
compensation
acts.
judge
sobeloff
in
the
majority
decision
below
stated
that
it
would
have
been
interesting
if
the
three
courts
or
at
least
in
the
fifth
circuit
which
decided
the
case
contrary-wise
from
the
fourth
circuit.
if
the
fifth
circuit
had
considered
the
impact
of
the
calbeck
decision
in
reaching
the
result
which
was
opposite
this
one,
the
fifth
circuit
did
not
in
precise
terms
refer
to
the
calbeck
decision.
it
did
however
refer
“to
the
extensive
scholarly
opinion
of
judge
watkins
who
had
at
length
discussed
the
calbeck
case
because
the
calbeck
case
had
been
argued
to
him."
and
in
the
ninth
circuit
case,
which
also
held
that
is
houser
against
o'leary,
which
also
held
that
piers
are
extensions
of
the
land
and
that
pier
ridges
are
covered
by
the
state
act
rather
than
the
federal
act.
there
the
calbeck
case
was
discussed
at
some
length.
mr.
randall
c.
coleman
now,
wait
a
minute,
the
admiralty
extension
act,
your
honor
--
mr.
randall
c.
coleman
no,
your
honor,
you
misunderstood
me.
what
i
said
was
that
the
longshoreman's
act
does
not
--
no
extension
of
the
longshoreman's
act
will
reach
a
pier
injury
because
that
is
not
on
navigable
waters.
mr.
randall
c.
coleman
now,
i
--
perhaps
what
you're
asking
me
mr.
justice
white
is
do
i
contend
that
congress
hasn't
the
right
in
the
exercise
of
its
maritime
jurisdiction
to
move
all
the
way
into
the
pier
and
thus
let
the
longshoreman's
act
cover
that?
i
think
sir
that
was
the
very
point
that
was
in
jensen
at
knickerbocker
and
dawson
where
they
held
no
and
it's
the
same
constitution.
and
it's
--
mr.
randall
c.
coleman
not
admiralty
jurisdiction.
admiralty
jurisdiction
goes
on
land,
your
honor's
decision
in
gutierrez
by
virtue
of
the
--
mr.
randall
c.
coleman
admiralty
extension
act.
mr.
randall
c.
coleman
but
jurisdiction
under
this
statute
is
strictly
limited
to
navigable
waters
by
its
terms.
mr.
randall
c.
coleman
now
that's
where
it
should
be
decided.
i
think
maybe
congress
could
but
it
would
be
faced
with
this
court
saying
it
couldn't
back
in
jensen
and
knickerbocker
and
dawson.
mr.
randall
c.
coleman
i
beg
your
pardon
sir?
mr.
randall
c.
coleman
yes,
sir.
it
hasn't
been
overruled.
i
remember
your
honor's
decision
in
davis
against
the
department
of
labor
when
no
one
there
suggested
that
it
would
be
appropriate
to
try
to
overrule
jensen
because
of
the
confusion
it
would
create.
now,
i'm
mindful
of
the
fact
that
the
solicitor
general
suggest
that
in
an
appropriate
case,
it
might
be
a
good
idea.
but
he
also
points
out
that
this
wouldn't
be
that
case,
because
this
calls
for
strictly
an
application
of
the
longshoreman's
act.
mr.
randall
c.
coleman
it
was
exercising
the
power
granted
it
under
article
iii,
i
think
it
is
the
maritime
power
in
the
area
where
the
states
may
not
act.
and
that
act
--
and
where
that
maritime
jurisdiction
extends
under
the
very
lengthy
discussions
in
those
three
cases
jensen,
knickerbocker
and
dawson
was
again
navigable
waters
because
the
lands
were
within
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
state.
now,
i'm
not
at
all
sure
that
that
would
be
followed
now.
all
i
know
is
that's
what
it
has
been
for
some
time.
the
court
wrote
fairly
convincing
opinions.
mr.
randall
c.
coleman
well,
they
merely
expanded
the
admiralty
tort
jurisdiction,
and
i'm
not
sure
whether
that
was
commerce
or
whether
it
might
have
been
maritime,
i
don't
know.
i
think
it
might've
been
commerce
but
i'm
not
sure.
but
i
know
that
the
approach
given
by
the
court
below
which
is
a
status
approach
certainly
contradicts
any
idea
that
the
admiralty
extension
act
extends
--
extends
the
coverage
of
the
longshoreman's
act.
i
finally
point
out
that
the
court
in
the
calbeck
case
also
quoted
extensively
senate
report
973,
which
was
the
crux
of
the
legislative
history
in
a
footnote
and
in
part
it
said
“injuries
occurring
in
loading
or
unloading
are
not
covered,
unless
they
occur
on
the
ship
or
between
the
wharf
and
the
ship.”
that's
what
congress
intended
and
as
i
understand
this
court's
decision
in
calbeck
and
many
others,
it
felt
the
same
way.
and
certainly
did
as
recently
as
calbeck.
now,
to
the
admiralty
extension
act,
i
believe
the
reading
of
the
act
itself
makes
it
fairly
clear
that
the
court
below
in
finding
that
the
admiralty
extension
act
did
extend
the
coverage
of
the
longshoreman's
act
was
mistaken.
the
second
part
of
the
admiralty
extension
act
to
which
very
little
attention
seems
to
have
been
paid,
and
which
was
not
commented
upon
is
that
in
any
such
case,
suit
may
be
brought
in
rem
or
in
personam
according
to
the
principles
of
law
and
the
rules
of
practice
obtaining
in
cases
where
the
injury
or
damage
has
been
done
and
consummated
on
navigable
water.
now
one
thing
that
is
definite
about
the
longshoreman's
act,
suit
is
not
brought.
the
longshoreman's
act
is
--
involves
an
administrative
proceeding
where
in
a
claim
is
filed
with
an
administrative
agency.
it
can't
be
done
in
rem.
it
can't
be
done
for
damages
--
for
damage,
it
is
done
for
injuries.
and
it
is
strictly
and
purely
an
administrative
proceeding.
and
to
argue
as
is
argued
below
and
by
respondents
that
the
admiralty
extension
act
expands.
it
is
completely
contradictory
to
the
same
argument
that
the
longshoreman's
act
is
status-oriented,
because
if
there's
one
thing
the
admiralty
extension
act
is,
it
is
clearly
situs-oriented.
mr.
randall
c.
coleman
review
of
the
deputy
commissioner's?
it
was
in
admiralty.
mr.
randall
c.
coleman
right
now
it's
civil,
it's
just
called
a
complaint
civil
--
it
was
in
admiralty,
yes
sir.
mr.
randall
c.
coleman
the
appeal
was
taken
up
in
admiralty,
yes
sir.
i
don't
think
it
proves
anything
sir?
mr.
randall
c.
coleman
no
certainly
not.
the
--
what
the
admiralty
extension
act
has
done
and
did
for
these
longshoremen,
is
give
them
the
right
to
do
what
they
done.
when
there's
a
pier
injury
caused,
that
is
the
maryland
longshoreman,
caused
by
a
vessel
and
there's
some
fault,
they
have
the
right
to
sue
the
third
party,
and
they've
exercised
that
right.
so
i
think
the
admiralty
extension
act
applies
only
to
a
right
which
they
have
exercised
and
does
not
expand
the
rights
they
have
which
are
considerable
under
the
longshoreman's
act.
unless
there's
some
further
questions.
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
randall
c.
coleman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
have
about
a
minute
left.
i'd
like
to
call
mr.
justice
white's
attention
and
i
won't
attempt
to
read
it.
but
in
--
at
page
25
your
honor
of
the
appendix,
judge
watkins
the
district
court
--
the
district
judge
who
decided
these
cases
did
go
into
the
legislative
history
of
the
extension
act.
mr.
randall
c.
coleman
and
the
last
thing
i
would
say,
your
honors,
is
that
i
think
it
becomes
abundantly
clear
why
the
argument
made
by
respondent
should
be
made
to
the
legislature
when
one
considers
that
there
are
states
in
which
the
benefits
afforded
by
the
state
acts
exceed
those
afforded
by
the
federal
acts.
and
in
those
states,
i
would
suggest
that
perhaps
this
action
would
not
have
been
brought.
and
this
is
not
a
case
of
no
compensation.
these
men
have
gotten
state
compensation.
it's
just
a
question
they're
trying
here
to
get
compensation
under
an
act,
which
we
submit,
your
honors,
does
not
apply
to
them.
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
randall
c.
coleman
thank
you
sir.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issues
before
the
court
today
involve
whether
or
not
injuries
which
have
occurred
to
longshoreman
on
piers
are
within
the
coverage
of
the
longshoreman's
act.
this
court
will
also
be
called
upon
to
consider
the
admiralty
extension
act
because
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit
answered
in
the
affirmative
the
question
of
whether
pier
injuries
were
covered
by
the
longshoreman's
act
and
further
stated
that
the
admiralty
extension
act
extended
the
coverage
of
the
longshoreman's
act.
the
facts
in
this
case,
i
think
your
honors
are
not
disputed.
they
are
consolidated
cases
and
the
cases
before
this
court
involve
three
longshoreman,
initially
i
might
say
that
four
longshoreman
were
involved
but
the
fourth
one,
a
man
named
van
had
sustained
his
injury
which
resulted
into
his
death
on
navigable
waters
and
the
deputy
commissioner
had
awarded
compensation
in
that
case
under
the
longshoreman's
act.
it
was
affirmed
by
the
district
court
and
further
affirmed
for
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit.
so,
it's
not
before
the
court
today.
in
the
cases
here,
two
longshoreman
were
working
in
maryland,
william
johnson
and
joseph
closeck
were
employees
of
the
nacirema
operating
company,
they
were
working
in
a
gondola
car
on
the
bethlehem
steel
high
pier
at
sparrow's
point,
maryland.
their
job
was
to
act
as
slingers
that
is
a
man
who
hooked
on
steel
beams
to
the
cables
or
falls
which
were
suspended
from
the
vessel
which
was
alongside
the
pier
in
the
process
of
loading
the
ship.
the
accident
which
befell
those
men
was
the
result
of
the
draft
swinging
and
it
knocked
mr.
closeck
from
the
gondola
car
to
the
pier,
he
sustained
injuries
which
resulted
in
his
death
and
mr.
johnson
was
pinned
against
the
side
of
the
gondola
car
and
he
there
sustained
his
injuries.
in
the
albert
avery
case,
the
accident
also
befell
him
while
he
was
in
a
gondola
car
and
he
was
on
the
city
piers
in
norfolk,
virginia,
acting
as
a
slinger
and
the
cargo
there
involved
was
a
cargo
of
logs.
the
logs
swung
against
him
and
injured
him
while
he
was
in
the
gondola
car.
now
in
each
case,
in
maryland
and
in
virginia,
the
cases
were
presented
to
the
respective
deputy
commissioners.
the
deputy
commissioners
in
each
instance
denied
coverage
under
the
longshoreman's
act
and
maintained
that
the
accidents
have
not
occurred
upon
the
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states.
thereafter,
the
cases
were
appealed
to
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
maryland
and
to
the
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
virginia
and
in
those
two
courts,
the
decisions
of
the
deputy
commissioners
were
upheld.
i
might
point
out
that
as
part
of
the
facts
and
which
the
court
will
certainly
wish
to
consider,
is
that
these
piers
were
very
long
piers,
they
were
on
pilings.
they
did
extend
over
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states.
the
men
who
worked
on
these
piers
could
and
did
pass
freely
between
the
ship
and
the
pier.
now,
when
the
case
was
taken
from
the
district
court
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit,
they
were
first
argued
before
separate
panels
then
consolidated
and
argued
before
the
court
embank.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit
reversed
the
district
court
judges
in
the
eastern
district
of
virginia
and
in
the
district
of
maryland
and
in
a
five
to
two
decision
held
at
these
accidents
did
fall
within
the
coverage
of
the
longshoreman's
act.
the
case
was
then
presented
to
this
court,
certiorari
was
granted,
the
solicitor
general
applied
for
certiorari
on
behalf
of
the
two
deputy
commissioners,
we
applied
for
certiorari
on
behalf
of
the
stevedoring
companies
below,
certiorari
was
granted.
the
case
was
argued
initially
before
this
court
in
march
of
this
year
and
then
set
down
for
re-argument
today.
i
recall
that
in
the
initial
argument,
i
had
been
asked
whether
or
not
an
appeal
from
the
deputy
commissioner
came
up
in
admiralty
on
the
civil
side
and
i
replied
that
it
arose
on
the
admiralty
side
of
the
docket.
i
was
correct
so
far
as
maryland
was
concerned
but
i
was
not
fully
correct
because
i
find
that
it's
a
matter
of
local
practice
and
though
in
maryland,
those
appeals
come
up
in
admiralty.
in
the
avery
case
which
came
up
in
virginia,
the
local
practice
differed
and
it
came
up
on
the
civil
side.
you
can
see
the
caption
of
the
case
is
at
pages
11
and
12
of
the
appendix
and
page
35
of
the
appendix
in
our
cases.
mr.
randall
c.
coleman
yes,
sir.
mr.
randall
c.
coleman
your
honor,
i
don't
think
it
makes
any
practical
difference.
i
had
been
asked
the
question
how
they
arose
on
what
side.
i
find
it
it's
entirely
a
practice,
a
matter
of
local
practice
within
the
courts.
so,i
think
it
makes
no
difference
at
all,
it's
just
a
matter
what
the
clerk
says
you
do
and
in
maryland
they
say
you
do
it
in
admiralty
and
in
virginia
they
say
you
do
it
on
the
civil
side
that
they
were
simply
captioned
that
way.
the
thing
that
--
the
point
which
i
think
is
very
critical
in
this
case
and
which
was
entirely
overlooked
in
the
court
below
despite
the
fact
that
it
was
argued
in
the
briefs,
extensively
covered
and
the
two
opinions
of
the
district
judges
is
the
fact
that
these
injuries
occurred
on
piers
and
the
further
fact
that
a
long
line
of
decisions
has
held
without
any
question
that
piers
are
extensions
of
the
land.
i
think
probably
the
leading
case
is
this
court's
decision
in
1945,
it
was
announced
by
mr.
justice
black,
it
was
mr.
chief
justice
stone's
decision.
swanson
against
marra
brothers,
it
involved
a
pier
injury
when
swanson
was
injured
on
the
pier
as
a
result
of
a
life
raft
from
the
vessel
dropping
on
him,
falling
on
him
and
injuring
him.
in
speaking
of
the
longshoreman's
act
and
this
language
has
been
quoted
repeatedly
when
the
question
has
arisen,
the
court
said
but
this
act,
that's
the
longshoreman's
act,
is
restricted
to
compensation
for
injuries
occurring
on
navigable
waters.
it
excludes
from
its
own
terms
and
from
the
jones
act
any
remedies
against
the
employer
for
injuries
inflicted
on
shore.
the
act
leaves
the
injured
employees
in
such
cases
to
pursue
the
remedies
afforded
by
local
law
and
in
these
very
cases,
the
accidents
occurred
on
piers
and
compensation
in
all
three
cases
has
been
given
to
the
men
and
the
widow
of
mr.
closeck
under
the
state
act
because
they
were
considered
land
injuries.
mr.
randall
c.
coleman
i
was
quoting,
your
honor
the
swanson
against
marra
brothers,
the
one
your
honor
announced,
i
think
mr.
chief
justice
stone
wrote
the
opinion.
this
court
followed
in
swanson
against
marra
brothers
and
still
follows,
as
always
followed
the
line
of
demarcation
which
was
drawn
in
the
jensen
case,
southern
pacific
against
jensen,
if
your
honors
recall
involved
fatal
injuries
which
occurred
on
a
gangway.
that
gangway
was
considered
to
be
on
navigable
waters.
there
had
been
an
effort
to
give
new
york
compensation,
new
york
state
compensation
for
the
injuries
sustained
there
but
the
supreme
court
would
not
permit
it
saying
that
it
was
violative
of
the
constitution
and
the
line
that
was
drawn
in
jensen
followed
in
the
dawson
case,
followed
in
the
knickerbocker
case
the
triambride
that
has
frequently
been
referred
to
by
this
court
ever
since
that
decision,
those
decisions
was
the
line
between
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states
and
land
or
extensions
of
the
land
and
where
it
occurred
on
navigable
waters,
the
longshoreman's
act
apply
and
where
it
occurred
on
land
or
extensions
of
land,
the
state
acts
applied.
now,
these
injuries
did
not
occur
on
the
exception
that
is
included
in
the
longshoreman's
act
of
any
dry
dock.
a
pier
such
as
this
or
a
wharf
is
not
considered
a
dry
dock.
what
is
considered
a
dry
dock
has
been
considered
and
discussed
at
length
by
this
court
in
avendeo
marine
ways
against
henderson,
that
was
mr.
justice
douglas'
decision,
certainly
these
accidents
do
not
fall
within
the
twilight
zone
which
was
davis
against
department
of
labor.
the
twilight
zone
are
the
undefined
and
indefinable
areas
which
are
very
shadowy
but
there's
nothing
shadowy
in
this
instance
because
it
was
a
clearly
pier
injury
all
the
way
where
confusion
sometimes
arises
and
i
was
asked
a
number
of
questions
along
these
lines
at
the
last
argument,
is
where
the
impact
occurs
at
one
place
and
the
damage
which
ensues
occurs
somewhere
else.
this
court
has
been
uniform
in
its
holdings
of
how
to
apply
coverage
under
those
conditions.
i
can
--
i
intend
to
run
down
those
cases
very
quickly
if
i
may
in
the
admiral
people's
case
which
was
a
1935
decision
of
the
court,
a
passenger
who
fell
from
a
gangway
to
the
dock
was
injured
on
the
dock
and
it
was
held
that
that
was
within
the
admiralty
tort
jurisdiction
at
the
time
because
the
accident
or
the
tort
occurred
on
navigable
waters.
the
injury
that
is
the
damage
to
the
person
occurred
to
the
passenger,
occurred
when
he
hit
the
dock.
but
it
arose
the
tort,
the
wrong
occurred
on
navigable
waters.
it
approved
that
did
not
involve
the
longshoreman's
act
but
within
the
body
of
the
admiral
people's,
this
court
refer
to
the
reasoning
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
in
lahode
against
crawl
and
there,
the
longshoreman
had
completed
his
job
on
the
pier
was
being
hoisted
from
the
pier
in
a
sling
to
the
deck
of
the
ship.
he
smacked
the
sling
swung
against
the
side
of
the
ship
and
he
hit
the
side
of
the
ship,
that's
where
the
court
considered
that
the
accident
occurred,
he
fell
back
and
sustained
injuries
on
the
pier
and
the
supreme
court
in
the
admiral
people's
approved
of
that
finding
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit.
in
minnie
against
port
huron,
it
faced
the
problem
directly
involving
the
longshoreman.
it
denied,
this
court
denied
state
compensation
coverage
to
a
longshoreman
who
was
on
the
ship
when
he
was
swung
by
a
swinging
load
on
the
ship
and
not
to
the
pier.
it
was
held
that
the
accident
which
brought
about
the
damage
occurred
on
navigable
waters.
it
cited
with
approval
its
prior
decision,
it
reaffirmed
its
prior
decision
in
smith
and
son
against
taylor
which
was
a
1928
decision
that
state
law
covered
the
longshoreman
who
was
struck
by
a
swinging
load
on
the
pier
and
was
knocked
into
the
water
so
that
the
supreme
court
has
been
uniform
in
its
holding
that
where
the
tort
or
injury
occurs,
even
though
the
damage
from
it
occurs
elsewhere,
the
coverage
depends
upon
the
place
of
the
happening
of
the
accident,
of
the
tort
or
the
striking
or
the
wrong.
now,
i'm
bound
to
say
that
this
has
not
been
absolutely
uniformly
applied
in
all
of
the
circuits
but
it
has
been
uniformly
applied
in
the
supreme
court
and
there
is
absolutely
uniformity
when
the
accident
clearly
occurred
on
a
pier
or
clearly
occurred
on
navigable
waters.
there
has
been
no
holding
anywhere
by
any
court
except
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit
and
the
decision
below
that
when
an
accident
clearly
occurs
on
a
pier
and
in
this
case
both
the
impact
and
the
injury
occurred
on
the
pier,
there
has
never
been
a
holding
except
the
court
below
to
the
affect
that
that
should
be
covered
by
the
longshoreman's
act.
this
--
this
court
has
uniformly
applied
it
in
these
series
of
cases,
jensen,
knickerbocker,
dawson,
those
were
navigable
waters
cases
and
the
court
would
not
permit
compensation
under
the
state
compensation
acts
in
nordenholt
and
swanson
against
marra
brothers,
the
injuries
were
clearly
pier
injuries
and
there
the
court
applied
state
compensation.
the
latest
cases
in
the
circuits
are
the
travelers
against
shea
and
nicholson
against
calbeck
from
the
fifth
circuit.
there
they
were
clearly
pier
injuries.
it
was
held
that
there
was
no
compensation
under
the
longshoreman's
act
and
this
court
denied
certiorari
in
those
two
cases
in
1968.
the
ninth
circuit
made
the
same
holding
in
houser
against
o'leary
likewise
a
pier
injury
clearly,
unmistakably
just
as
in
this
case,
the
ninth
circuit
denied
coverage
under
the
longshoreman's
act
and
in
1968
this
court
denied
certiorari
so
the
only
exception
to
this
uniform
rule
of
all
the
circuits
and
this
court
is
the
decision
below.
it
relied
on
the
calbeck
case,
calbeck
against
traveler's
insurance
company,
reported
at
370
united
states
114.
since
the
court
did
rely
so
heavily
on
that,
i
would
like
to
go
into
it
if
i
may
rather
extensively
because
i
think
the
court
below
mistakenly
read
and
applied
the
calbeck
decision.
that
case
involved
injuries
to
two
or
more
shipyard
workers
who
sustained
injuries
on
ships
which
were
under
construction
and
on
navigable
waters.
now,
the
court
was
concerned
just
what
to
do
in
that
case
because
in
a
similar
case
which
this
court
had
decided
grant
smith-porter
ship
company
against
rohde,
the
court
had
held
that
in
new
construction,
a
state
act
applied.
they
were
fearful
that
there
might
be
a
gap
that
in
areas
such
as
the
new
construction
in
the
calbeck
against
traveler's
insurance
company
case,
there
might
be
no
coverage
at
all
so
what
the
court
did
hold
in
calbeck
was
that
there
could
be
coverage
under
either
act,
it
did
not
say
that
pier
injuries
or
land
injuries
were
covered
by
a
state
act.
what
it
said
repeatedly
over
and
over
again
was
that
irrespective
of
what
else
may
be
considered
in
this
case,
these
workmen
were
injured
on
navigable
waters.
it
said
it
over
and
over
again
and
the
court
held
that
since
the
injuries
to
the
men
in
the
calbeck
case
did
occur
upon
navigable
waters,
they
had
the
right
to
recover
under
the
longshoreman's
act.
now,
the
court
in
that
case
repeated
and
reaffirmed
its
adherence
to
the
jensen
line
of
demarcation.
it
referred
to
it
in
so
many
words,
the
line
again
is
that
which
has
been
drawn
and
clearly
established
for
42
years
between
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states
and
land
or
extensions
of
land.
it
referred
to
the
very
language
of
senate
report
973
which
has
been
quoted
extensively
in
the
descending
opinion
below
and
in
the
opinion
both
of
judges
watkins
and
hoffman
in
the
district
courts
as
a
language
which
shows
that
the
legislative
history
likewise
supports
such
a
finding,
senate
report
973
says
injuries
occurring
in
loading
or
unloading
are
not
covered
unless
they
occur
on
the
ship
or
between
the
wharf
and
the
ship
and
these
injuries
didn't
occur
on
the
ship,
nor
did
they
occur
between
the
wharf
and
the
ship,
they
occurred
on
the
pier.
the
court
below
likewise
held
and
considered
that
the
admiralty
extension
act
extended
and
expanded
the
coverage
of
the
longshoreman's
act.
i
think,
your
honors
that
the
court
below
was
mistaken
in
that.
the
admiralty
extension
act
did
indeed
expand
admiralty,
tort,
jurisdiction
to
torts
which
occurred
on
land
if
caused
by
a
vessel
on
navigable
waters
and
that's
all
the
admiralty
extension
act
did.
now.
that
does
not
mean
that
the
admiralty
extension
act
did
not
have
an
impact
on
these
very
cases
it's
by
virtue
of
the
admiralty
extension
act
that
this
mrs.
closeck
and
mr.
johnson
have
presently
pending
third
party
damage
claims
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
maryland
for
damages
as
a
result
of
this.
mr.
randall
c.
coleman
yes,
sir.
against
bethlehem
steel
company.
mr.
randall
c.
coleman
yes,
sir.
bethlehem
owns,
the
ship
was
the
beth
text.
no
sir,
bethlehem
owned
the
ship,
it
was
the
beth
text
and
--
mr.
randall
c.
coleman
unseaworthiness,
the
allegation
is,
if
i
remember
correctly
the
allegation
is
that
the
crane
which
was
on
the
ship
was
defective
and
in
someway
and
so
there
is
a
suit
pending
by
virtue
of
the
admiralty
extension
act
against
the
vessel
owner
and
that's
how
the
admiralty
extension
act
comes
into
play
in
this
type
of
accident.
it
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
longshoreman's
act
coverage.
now,
i
think
what
the
lower
court
failed
to
take
into
account
was
the
very
language
of
the
admiralty
extension
act
in
the
second
paragraph,
the
second
paragraph
of
the
admiralty
extension
act
refers
to
bringing
a
suit
in
rem
or
in
personam.
that's
not
what
happens
under
the
longshoreman's
act,
the
longshoreman's
act
is
an
administrative
claim,
you
don't
bring
your
suit,
you
don't
sue
in
rem
under
the
longshoreman's
act.
you
can
do
that
for
damages
by
virtue
of
the
expansion
of
admiralty
tort
jurisdiction.
it's
an
administrative
proceeding
under
the
longshoreman's
act
which
involves
no
suit
at
all,
it's
an
administrative
claim,
it's
brought
only
for
compensation,
a
claim
is
filed
rather
than
suit
so
i
think
the
lower
court
simply
did
not
take
into
account
the
legislative
history,
the
reasons,
the
purposes
of
the
act
or
anything
else
and
misread
the
clear
language.
that
act
was
passed
entirely
in
1948.
it
was
passed
in
order
to
rectify
certain
inequities
which
existed
when
people
who,
people
or
persons
which
existed
when
people
who,
people
or
persons
or
things
that
were
damaged
on
land
by
ships
on
navigable
waters
were,
until
the
passage
of
this
act
denied
the
right
to
an
admiralty
proceeding.
that
leads
your
honors,
into
a
brief
consideration
of
this
court's
decision
in
rodrigue
against
aetna
casualty
insurity
company.
that
case
was
decided
by
the
unanimous
court
after
the
argument
in
this
case
in
march
and
i
believe
the
rodrigue
case
may
have
been
argued
before
the
march
argument.
it
did
not
specifically
involve
the
longshoreman's
act
but
the
rodrigue
case
did
involve
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
in
which
the
court
held
that
congress
had
adopted
state
law
rather
than
federal
law
for
civil
actions
involving
wrong
for
depths
of
workers
employed
on
artificial
island
drilling
rigs.
now,
since
the
author
of
the
decision,
mr.
justice
white
did
refer
in
his
opinion
to
admiralty
jurisdiction
and
accidents
which
occurred
on
piers
located
above
navigable
waters,
it
seems
important
to
examine
that
language
in
the
light
of
this
case.
i
think
that
it's
perfectly
clear
from
all
the
existing
law
to
date
that
there
is
certainly
no
longshoreman's
act
coverage
for
land
injuries.
i
believe
your
honors
it's
also
clear
that
the
longshoreman's
act
extends
only
to
accidents
which
occurred
on
navigable
waters
and
there
can
be
admiralty
jurisdiction
of
course
where
there's
longshoreman's
act
coverage
but
there's
not
admiralty
jurisdiction
in
every,
i
mean
there's
not
longshoreman's
act
coverage
in
every
place
that
there's
admiralty
jurisdiction
because
we've
already
seen
that
the
admiralty
extension
act
gives
admiralty
jurisdiction
in
cases
like
gutierrez
case
where
a
ship
on
navigable
waters
causes
damage
to
shore.
now,
the
language
of
this
court
and
its
unanimous
opinion
in
rodrigue
just
very
recently
was
the
accidents
had
no
more
connection
with
the
ordinary
stuff
of
admiralty
than
do
accidents
on
piers.
mr.
justice
white
later
on
stated
the
accidents
would
be
no
more
under
admiralty
jurisdiction
than
accidents
on
a
wharf
located
above
navigable
waters.
if
that
is
what
this
court
thinks
as
a
law
that
is
what
this
case
is
all
about.
if
these
accidents
didn't
occur
on
navigable
waters,
if
this
case
doesn't
involve
admiralty
jurisdiction,
then
clearly
the
lower
court
have
to
be
wrong
and
that
was
the
decision
of
this
court
in
rodrigue
since
the
argument,
since
the
initial
argument
in
march
of
1969.
the
last
point
i
would
like
to
cover
is
the
continued
stress
by
the
respondents
below
by
the
longshoreman
that
it
is
so
unfair
to
longshoreman
who
happen
to
reside
in
virginia
and
maryland
not
to
be
able
to
receive
federal
compensation
because
federal
compensation
in
maryland
and
virginia
is
considerably
less
than
the
state
--
it
is
considerably
greater
than
the
state
compensation
in
those
two
states.
well,
one
it
seems
to
me
that
is
clearly
a
legislative
argument.
but
it
ignores
what
they're
planning
to
do
to
longshoreman
located
in
those
states
where
the
state
compensation
is
in
excess
of
the
federal
compensation.
i
know
for
example
as
there's
alaska,
california,
new
york
to
name
three.
thus,
if
in
fact
they
want
to
change
the
law
for
maryland
and
virginia,
they're
going
to
take
away
from
the
longshoreman
and
other
jurisdictions
what
those
states
provide.
if
the
congress
see
it's
fit
to
change
the
language
of
the
longshoreman's
act
or
if
the
states
see
fit
to
change
the
amount
of
compensation,
that
is
one
thing
but
i've
submit
your
honors
that
this
case
is
one
which
falls
clearly
within
the
language
of
the
longshoreman's
act.
it's
been
uniformly
decided
here
that
if
the
accidents
do
not
occur
on
navigable
waters,
they
are
not
covered
for
the
longshoreman's
act.
thank
you
sir.
mr.
randall
c.
coleman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issues
before
the
court
today
are
whether
pier
injuries
to
longshoreman
are
injuries
which
occurred
on
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states
and
are
thus
within
the
coverage
of
the
longshoreman's
act.
that
question
was
answered
in
the
affirmative
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit,
and
therefore
as
one
of
the
reasons
that
the
fourth
circuit
decided
the
case
affirmatively
was
that
the
admiralty
extension
act
broadened
and
expanded
the
coverage
of
the
longshoreman's
act.
the
court
will
also
have
before
it
the
admiralty
extension
act
and
whether
or
not
it
did
in
fact
extend
the
coverage
to
the
longshoreman's
act.
the
facts
in
the
case
are
undisputed
and
i
will
give
them,
your
honors
together
with
the
history
of
the
case.
these
consolidated
cases
arose
from
pier
injuries
to
three
longshoremen.
one
of
the
injuries
resulted
in
the
death
of
the
longshoreman.
the
cases
arose,
two
of
them,
william
johnson
and
joseph
klosek
arose
in
maryland
and
one
albert
avery
arose
in
virginia.
they
were
pier
injuries
under
virtually
identical
circumstances
because
all
three
of
the
longshoremen
involved
were,
what
is
known
as
slingers.
they
worked
and
were
working
at
the
time
of
the
injuries
in
gondola
cars
on
piers.
they
were
slinging
on
cargo
which
was
attached
to
ships'
falls
or
cables
which
then
loaded
the
cargo
which
was
being
slung
on
to
the
vessel.
the
piers
in
the
--
well
the
pier
in
the
maryland
case
was
on
the
patapsco
river.
it
extended
out
into
that
river
approximately
600
feet,
i
believe,
and
there's
no
question
that
the
patapsco
river
is
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states.
the
pier
in
the
virginia
case,
city
piers
of
north
of
virginia
extended
i
think
about
a
thousand
feet
into
the
elizabeth
river.
there's
also
no
dispute
that
the
elizabeth
river
is
on
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states.
it
was
found
as
a
fact
and
not
disputed
that
these
longshoremen
in
both
cases
might
have
been
working
on
the
pier
at
one
time.
they
might
also
have
gone
aboard
the
vessel.
they
sometimes
switched
positions.
it
is
also
found
as
a
fact
and
undisputed
that
these
particular
piers
were
piers
which
were
erected
on
pilings.
and
certain
small
craft
could
get
under
them,
and
i
think
canoes
and
rowboats
were
named.
large
vessels
could
not
because
the
piers
instructed
them.
the
deputy
commissioner
oosting
in
virginia
and
deputy
commissioner
traynor
in
maryland
both
found
that
the
injuries
to
these
men
which
resulted
when
cargo
swung
against
the
men,
in
the
case
of
joseph
klosek,
he
was
knocked
out
off
the
gondola
car
to
the
dock
and
sustained
fatal
injuries.
the
other
two
men
johnson
and
avery
were
pinned
against
the
side
of
the
railroad
car.
the
deputy
commissioner
found
that
those
injuries,
both
deputy
commissioners,
found
that
those
injuries
were
injuries
which
did
not
occur
upon
navigable
waters.
the
opinions
of
both
the
deputy
commissioners
were
then
appealed
to
the
district
courts
first
to
the
eastern
district
of
virginia
and
to
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
maryland.
and
the
district
judges,
judge
hoffman
from
the
eastern
district
of
virginia,
judge
watkins
from
the
district
of
maryland
affirmed
the
findings
of
the
deputy
commissioner.
the
cases
were
then
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit.
they
were
first,
the
avery
case
and
the
johnson
and
klosek
cases
were
first
argued
in
separate
panels,
and
after
that
they
were
consolidated
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit
en
banc
heard
all
three
cases.
they
reversed
the
two
district
judges.
certiorari
was
applied
for
by
the
nacirema
operating
company
in
the
maryland
case
by
liberty
mutual
insurance
company
in
the
virginia
case,
and
by
solicitor
general
on
behalf
of
the
two
deputy
commissioners
and
with
us
before
the
court.
the
principal
point
upon
which
i
rely
is
that
for
some
years,
the
piers
have
been
considered
extensions
of
the
land.
i
believe
that
was
the
law
some
time
ago
and
is
presently
the
law.
the
point
was
never
mentioned
by
the
court
of
appeals
below
and
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
might
have
had
somewhat
difficult
time
answering
the
question.
a
number
of
cases
from
this
court
were
cited,
they
were
on
page
10
of
our
briefs.
the
most
recent
that
i
can
think
of,
of
this
court
is
the
opinion
announced
by
mr.
justice
black
in
swanson
against
marra
brothers
which
i
think
is
certainly
still
the
law,
it
certainly
the
most
well
known
case.
i
will
only
quote
that
portion
of
the
opinion
which
relates
to
this
point.
“swanson
was
a
longshoreman
who
was
injured
on
the
pier
when
a
life
raft
fell
from
the
ship
and
injured
him.”
and
this
court
said
without
dissent,
but
since
the
act,
that's
the
longshoreman's
act,
is
restricted
to
compensation
for
injuries
occurring
on
navigable
waters,
it
excludes
from
its
own
terms
and
from
the
jones
act,
any
remedies
against
the
employer
for
injuries
inflicted
on
shore.
the
act
leaves
the
injured
employees
in
such
cases
to
pursue
the
remedies
afforded
by
local
law.
the
court
then
and
prior
to
that
had
always
considered
pier
injuries
to
be
shore
injuries,
and
i
submit
your
honors
that
that
is
still
the
law.
the
court,
this
court
has
always
followed
i
believe,
the
line
of
demarcation
which
was
set
out
in
the
jensen
case
years
ago,
and
that
line
is
the
line
between
state
and
federal
coverage.
and
specifically
it's
the
line
between
navigable
waters
and
land,
or
extensions
of
the
land.
i
think
that
has
always
been
the
law.
so
far
as
i
know,
there
has
never
been
a
decision,
except
that
of
the
fourth
circuit
which
disputes
that
pier
injuries
are
considered
as
land
injuries.
the
injuries
in
this
instance,
all
having
occurred
on
the
pier
don't
fall
within
the
stated
exception
of
the
act,
which
is
any
dry
dock.
dry
docks
were
explained
and
detailed
as
to
what
they
were
by
mr.
justice
douglas
in
avondale
marine
ways
against
henderson
i
think.
and
it
was
clearly
pointed
out
that
the
types
of
dry
dock
referred
to
are
not
wharfs
or
piers,
as
they
were
in
this
instance.
the
case
does
not
--
the
injuries
do
not
fall
within
the
court's
exception
which
was
in
mr.
justice
black's
decision
in
davis
against
the
department
of
labor
in
the
twilight
zone.
the
twilight
zone
as
i
understand
it
is
that
sort
of
hazy
area
between
the
ship
and
the
pier
where
it's
difficult
to
determine
which
coverage
does
apply.
and
the
court
in
the
twilight
zone
cases
has
held
that
there
may
be
both
state
and
federal
coverage
and
the
injured
longshoreman
may
elect.
the
case
most
heavily
relied
upon
by
the
court
below
was
calbeck
against
travelers
insurance
company.
i
hope
since
it
was
discussed
at
some
length
that
this
court
won't
consider
it
presumptions
of
me,
in
particularly
mr.
justice
brennan
to
try
to
state
what
i
think
that
case
held.
i
do
not
think
that
the
case
held
as
the
court
of
appeals
below
said
it
held
that
pier
injuries
could
be
covered
by
the
longshoreman's
act.
that
was
a
case
your
honors
will
recall
which
involved
two
or
more
shipyard
workers
who
were
injured
aboard
ships
which
were
on
navigable
waters
under
new
construction.
they
were
ships
under
construction.
now
the
court
had
before
it,
its
prior
holding
in
1922
of
grant
smith-porter
ship
company
against
rohde,
and
that
case
long
ago
had
established
that
there
was
a
local
concern
in
navigable
--
in
ships
that
were
under
construction
in
navigable
waters.
and
where
there
were
such
local
concern
that
the
state
compensation
acts
could
apply
that
there
and
in
that
instance
the
state
acts
may
apply
and
federal
coverage
did
not
come
into
effect.
now,
i
gathered
from
mr.
justice
brennan's
opinion
that
this
court
was
very
much
concerned
with
whether
or
not
in
all
the
cases
where
there
was
local
concern,
and
particularly
in
the
very
case
it
was
before
it
there
would
definitely
be
coverage
for
longshoremen
who
were
injured.
there
was
the
fear,
i
got
from
the
opinion
there
was
the
fear
that
there
might
not
be
state
or
federal
coverage
somewhere
for
those
men
who
were
working
in
areas
that
the
pre-1927
decisions
had
set
aside
as
local
concern
areas.
so
the
court
in
reversing
the
fifth
circuit,
i
believe
it
was
the
fifth
circuit,
in
reversing
the
fifth
circuit
held
that
what
this
act
meant
was
precisely
what
it
said.
it
wanted
to
cover
injuries
which
occurred
to
longshoreman
on
navigable
waters.
it
didn't
mean
all
injuries.
it
meant
injuries
on
navigable
waters.
there
was
no
dispute
that
there
is
no
dispute.
there
can
be
no
dispute
that
ships
under
construction
just
as
much
as
ships
that
have
been
built
are
on
navigable
waters
if
they
are
afloat
or
in
a
dry
dock
or
a
marine
railway.
mr.
randall
c.
coleman
no
sir,
not
--
mr.
randall
c.
coleman
your
honor
that
was
a
case
that
was
not
brought
up
on
certiorari.
mr.
randall
c.
coleman
there
were
two
men
in
norfolk,
i
can't
recall
the
other
man's
name,
but
you're
quite
right.
mr.
randall
c.
coleman
one
was
knocked
off.
mr.
randall
c.
coleman
your
honor,
to
me
it
makes
a
difference
in
that
--
well,
i
felt
too
that
that
man
was
injured
on
navigable
waters.
i
think
this
is
totally
situs-oriented
and
that
a
man
who
sustains
his
injury
in
the
ocean,
or
in
the
river,
in
the
water
is
clearly
on
navigable
waters.
mr.
randall
c.
coleman
i
suppose.
i
suppose
whenever
you
draw
a
line,
it's
a
difficult
line
to
draw,
yes
sir.
mr.
randall
c.
coleman
this
--
well
let's
see.
in
each
instance
particularly
--
well
i
know
in
the
maryland
case,
there
was
a
derrick
or
crane
on
a
ship
and
from
that
derrick
or
crane,
the
line
descended
to
the
gondola
car
and
hoisted
the
steel
beams,
that
was
the
same
was
true
--
mr.
randall
c.
coleman
yes,
sir.
mr.
randall
c.
coleman
that's
exactly
it,
your
honor.
i
know
--
i
recognize
--
i
can't
dispute
that
incongruities
are
going
to
develop
wherever
line
is
drawn.
mr.
randall
c.
coleman
oh
yes.
mr.
randall
c.
coleman
yes.
mr.
randall
c.
coleman
yes,
sir.
mr.
randall
c.
coleman
no
wait.
i'm
not
sure
the
deputy
commissioner
did
your
honor.
i
know
the
court
of
appeals
held
--
mr.
randall
c.
coleman
i
believe
the
deputy
--
that's
right,
it
did
uphold
the
award
in
that
case.
i
haven't
born
that
one
as
closely
that
--
mr.
randall
c.
coleman
i
believe
--
mr.
randall
c.
coleman
yes,
sir.
mr.
randall
c.
coleman
the
injury
occurred
on
the
ship
your
honor.
that
case
was
covered
by
this
court,
the
admiral
peoples
is
the
same
idea
as
the
--
it
happened
to
be
the
gangway
in
that
case.
mr.
randall
c.
coleman
your
honor,
again
you're
hitting
me
right
where
that
line
is
drawn
and
it's
tough.
mr.
randall
c.
coleman
sir?
mr.
randall
c.
coleman
no
sir,
i
can't
give
the
line
up.
but
all
that
the
court
of
appeals
has
done
below
is
it
just
redrawn
the
line.
it's
just
a
question
of
where
you
are
going
to
draw
it.
wherever
its
drawn,
somebody
on
the
other
side
of
it
whose
agreed
is
going
to
be
nudging
and
say
“i
ought
to
be
on
that
side
of
it.”
and
i
think
that
this
is
a
clearly
established
line.
i
honestly
think
it's
a
logical
line
to
draw
that
is
navigable
waters.
it
was
drawn
by
this
court
for
constitutional
reasons,
navigable
waters
and
the
land.
now,
there
are
a
number
of
examples
that
show
what
might
happen
if
it
were
extended
further
shoreward.
they
might
sound
farfetched,
but
they're
not
farfetched
if
the
court
adopts
the
status
approach
that
was
adopted
by
the
fourth
circuit,
anytime
the
status
approached
--
approach
is
adopted,
it's
going
to
be
extremely
difficult
to
tell
what
to
do
about
that
line.
but
if
a
clear
situs
approach
is
adopted,
you
know
if
it
happened
on
navigable
waters.
it
was
covered
by
this
act.
if
it
happened
on
land
or
extensions
of
land,
it's
covered
by
the
state
act.
the
court
in
calbeck
went
on
to
point
out
that
the
pre-1927
decisions
which
has
been
referred
to
in
the
respondent's
brief
as
static
decisions
where
we
should
not
freeze
the
line,
were
those
very
decisions
of
local
concern,
so
i
--
and
it
was
brought
out
in
the
calbeck
case
just
as
it
was
brought
out
in
the
parker
against
motor
boat
sales
before
it,
that
the
local
concern
doctrine
was
said
to
have
been
read
out
of
the
act.
and
that
it
simply
means
that
where
there
are
navigable
waters,
and
the
court
used
to
term
navigable
waters
frequently,
where
there
are
navigable
waters,
that
is
where
the
federal
act
applies.
the
court
also
recognized
in
the
calbeck
case
the
jensen
line
of
demarcation.
it
had
recognized
it
in
previous
cases.
the
court
cited
in
the
calbeck
case,
the
fifth
circuit
case
of
debardelen
which
quoted
that
congress
intended
to
exercise
to
the
fullest
extent
its
power
to
act
in
this
area.
the
fullest
extent
was
determined
by
the
court
sometime
ago
to
be
where
there
are
navigable
waters
and
apart
from
land
or
extensions
of
land
which
were
then
the
domain
of
the
state
compensation
acts.
judge
sobeloff
in
the
majority
decision
below
stated
that
it
would
have
been
interesting
if
the
three
courts
or
at
least
in
the
fifth
circuit
which
decided
the
case
contrary-wise
from
the
fourth
circuit.
if
the
fifth
circuit
had
considered
the
impact
of
the
calbeck
decision
in
reaching
the
result
which
was
opposite
this
one,
the
fifth
circuit
did
not
in
precise
terms
refer
to
the
calbeck
decision.
it
did
however
refer
“to
the
extensive
scholarly
opinion
of
judge
watkins
who
had
at
length
discussed
the
calbeck
case
because
the
calbeck
case
had
been
argued
to
him."
and
in
the
ninth
circuit
case,
which
also
held
that
is
houser
against
o'leary,
which
also
held
that
piers
are
extensions
of
the
land
and
that
pier
ridges
are
covered
by
the
state
act
rather
than
the
federal
act.
there
the
calbeck
case
was
discussed
at
some
length.
mr.
randall
c.
coleman
now,
wait
a
minute,
the
admiralty
extension
act,
your
honor
--
mr.
randall
c.
coleman
no,
your
honor,
you
misunderstood
me.
what
i
said
was
that
the
longshoreman's
act
does
not
--
no
extension
of
the
longshoreman's
act
will
reach
a
pier
injury
because
that
is
not
on
navigable
waters.
mr.
randall
c.
coleman
now,
i
--
perhaps
what
you're
asking
me
mr.
justice
white
is
do
i
contend
that
congress
hasn't
the
right
in
the
exercise
of
its
maritime
jurisdiction
to
move
all
the
way
into
the
pier
and
thus
let
the
longshoreman's
act
cover
that?
i
think
sir
that
was
the
very
point
that
was
in
jensen
at
knickerbocker
and
dawson
where
they
held
no
and
it's
the
same
constitution.
and
it's
--
mr.
randall
c.
coleman
not
admiralty
jurisdiction.
admiralty
jurisdiction
goes
on
land,
your
honor's
decision
in
gutierrez
by
virtue
of
the
--
mr.
randall
c.
coleman
admiralty
extension
act.
mr.
randall
c.
coleman
but
jurisdiction
under
this
statute
is
strictly
limited
to
navigable
waters
by
its
terms.
mr.
randall
c.
coleman
now
that's
where
it
should
be
decided.
i
think
maybe
congress
could
but
it
would
be
faced
with
this
court
saying
it
couldn't
back
in
jensen
and
knickerbocker
and
dawson.
mr.
randall
c.
coleman
i
beg
your
pardon
sir?
mr.
randall
c.
coleman
yes,
sir.
it
hasn't
been
overruled.
i
remember
your
honor's
decision
in
davis
against
the
department
of
labor
when
no
one
there
suggested
that
it
would
be
appropriate
to
try
to
overrule
jensen
because
of
the
confusion
it
would
create.
now,
i'm
mindful
of
the
fact
that
the
solicitor
general
suggest
that
in
an
appropriate
case,
it
might
be
a
good
idea.
but
he
also
points
out
that
this
wouldn't
be
that
case,
because
this
calls
for
strictly
an
application
of
the
longshoreman's
act.
mr.
randall
c.
coleman
it
was
exercising
the
power
granted
it
under
article
iii,
i
think
it
is
the
maritime
power
in
the
area
where
the
states
may
not
act.
and
that
act
--
and
where
that
maritime
jurisdiction
extends
under
the
very
lengthy
discussions
in
those
three
cases
jensen,
knickerbocker
and
dawson
was
again
navigable
waters
because
the
lands
were
within
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
state.
now,
i'm
not
at
all
sure
that
that
would
be
followed
now.
all
i
know
is
that's
what
it
has
been
for
some
time.
the
court
wrote
fairly
convincing
opinions.
mr.
randall
c.
coleman
well,
they
merely
expanded
the
admiralty
tort
jurisdiction,
and
i'm
not
sure
whether
that
was
commerce
or
whether
it
might
have
been
maritime,
i
don't
know.
i
think
it
might've
been
commerce
but
i'm
not
sure.
but
i
know
that
the
approach
given
by
the
court
below
which
is
a
status
approach
certainly
contradicts
any
idea
that
the
admiralty
extension
act
extends
--
extends
the
coverage
of
the
longshoreman's
act.
i
finally
point
out
that
the
court
in
the
calbeck
case
also
quoted
extensively
senate
report
973,
which
was
the
crux
of
the
legislative
history
in
a
footnote
and
in
part
it
said
“injuries
occurring
in
loading
or
unloading
are
not
covered,
unless
they
occur
on
the
ship
or
between
the
wharf
and
the
ship.”
that's
what
congress
intended
and
as
i
understand
this
court's
decision
in
calbeck
and
many
others,
it
felt
the
same
way.
and
certainly
did
as
recently
as
calbeck.
now,
to
the
admiralty
extension
act,
i
believe
the
reading
of
the
act
itself
makes
it
fairly
clear
that
the
court
below
in
finding
that
the
admiralty
extension
act
did
extend
the
coverage
of
the
longshoreman's
act
was
mistaken.
the
second
part
of
the
admiralty
extension
act
to
which
very
little
attention
seems
to
have
been
paid,
and
which
was
not
commented
upon
is
that
in
any
such
case,
suit
may
be
brought
in
rem
or
in
personam
according
to
the
principles
of
law
and
the
rules
of
practice
obtaining
in
cases
where
the
injury
or
damage
has
been
done
and
consummated
on
navigable
water.
now
one
thing
that
is
definite
about
the
longshoreman's
act,
suit
is
not
brought.
the
longshoreman's
act
is
--
involves
an
administrative
proceeding
where
in
a
claim
is
filed
with
an
administrative
agency.
it
can't
be
done
in
rem.
it
can't
be
done
for
damages
--
for
damage,
it
is
done
for
injuries.
and
it
is
strictly
and
purely
an
administrative
proceeding.
and
to
argue
as
is
argued
below
and
by
respondents
that
the
admiralty
extension
act
expands.
it
is
completely
contradictory
to
the
same
argument
that
the
longshoreman's
act
is
status-oriented,
because
if
there's
one
thing
the
admiralty
extension
act
is,
it
is
clearly
situs-oriented.
mr.
randall
c.
coleman
review
of
the
deputy
commissioner's?
it
was
in
admiralty.
mr.
randall
c.
coleman
right
now
it's
civil,
it's
just
called
a
complaint
civil
--
it
was
in
admiralty,
yes
sir.
mr.
randall
c.
coleman
the
appeal
was
taken
up
in
admiralty,
yes
sir.
i
don't
think
it
proves
anything
sir?
mr.
randall
c.
coleman
no
certainly
not.
the
--
what
the
admiralty
extension
act
has
done
and
did
for
these
longshoremen,
is
give
them
the
right
to
do
what
they
done.
when
there's
a
pier
injury
caused,
that
is
the
maryland
longshoreman,
caused
by
a
vessel
and
there's
some
fault,
they
have
the
right
to
sue
the
third
party,
and
they've
exercised
that
right.
so
i
think
the
admiralty
extension
act
applies
only
to
a
right
which
they
have
exercised
and
does
not
expand
the
rights
they
have
which
are
considerable
under
the
longshoreman's
act.
unless
there's
some
further
questions.
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
randall
c.
coleman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
have
about
a
minute
left.
i'd
like
to
call
mr.
justice
white's
attention
and
i
won't
attempt
to
read
it.
but
in
--
at
page
25
your
honor
of
the
appendix,
judge
watkins
the
district
court
--
the
district
judge
who
decided
these
cases
did
go
into
the
legislative
history
of
the
extension
act.
mr.
randall
c.
coleman
and
the
last
thing
i
would
say,
your
honors,
is
that
i
think
it
becomes
abundantly
clear
why
the
argument
made
by
respondent
should
be
made
to
the
legislature
when
one
considers
that
there
are
states
in
which
the
benefits
afforded
by
the
state
acts
exceed
those
afforded
by
the
federal
acts.
and
in
those
states,
i
would
suggest
that
perhaps
this
action
would
not
have
been
brought.
and
this
is
not
a
case
of
no
compensation.
these
men
have
gotten
state
compensation.
it's
just
a
question
they're
trying
here
to
get
compensation
under
an
act,
which
we
submit,
your
honors,
does
not
apply
to
them.
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
randall
c.
coleman
thank
you
sir.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issues
before
the
court
today
involve
whether
or
not
injuries
which
have
occurred
to
longshoreman
on
piers
are
within
the
coverage
of
the
longshoreman's
act.
this
court
will
also
be
called
upon
to
consider
the
admiralty
extension
act
because
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit
answered
in
the
affirmative
the
question
of
whether
pier
injuries
were
covered
by
the
longshoreman's
act
and
further
stated
that
the
admiralty
extension
act
extended
the
coverage
of
the
longshoreman's
act.
the
facts
in
this
case,
i
think
your
honors
are
not
disputed.
they
are
consolidated
cases
and
the
cases
before
this
court
involve
three
longshoreman,
initially
i
might
say
that
four
longshoreman
were
involved
but
the
fourth
one,
a
man
named
van
had
sustained
his
injury
which
resulted
into
his
death
on
navigable
waters
and
the
deputy
commissioner
had
awarded
compensation
in
that
case
under
the
longshoreman's
act.
it
was
affirmed
by
the
district
court
and
further
affirmed
for
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit.
so,
it's
not
before
the
court
today.
in
the
cases
here,
two
longshoreman
were
working
in
maryland,
william
johnson
and
joseph
closeck
were
employees
of
the
nacirema
operating
company,
they
were
working
in
a
gondola
car
on
the
bethlehem
steel
high
pier
at
sparrow's
point,
maryland.
their
job
was
to
act
as
slingers
that
is
a
man
who
hooked
on
steel
beams
to
the
cables
or
falls
which
were
suspended
from
the
vessel
which
was
alongside
the
pier
in
the
process
of
loading
the
ship.
the
accident
which
befell
those
men
was
the
result
of
the
draft
swinging
and
it
knocked
mr.
closeck
from
the
gondola
car
to
the
pier,
he
sustained
injuries
which
resulted
in
his
death
and
mr.
johnson
was
pinned
against
the
side
of
the
gondola
car
and
he
there
sustained
his
injuries.
in
the
albert
avery
case,
the
accident
also
befell
him
while
he
was
in
a
gondola
car
and
he
was
on
the
city
piers
in
norfolk,
virginia,
acting
as
a
slinger
and
the
cargo
there
involved
was
a
cargo
of
logs.
the
logs
swung
against
him
and
injured
him
while
he
was
in
the
gondola
car.
now
in
each
case,
in
maryland
and
in
virginia,
the
cases
were
presented
to
the
respective
deputy
commissioners.
the
deputy
commissioners
in
each
instance
denied
coverage
under
the
longshoreman's
act
and
maintained
that
the
accidents
have
not
occurred
upon
the
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states.
thereafter,
the
cases
were
appealed
to
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
maryland
and
to
the
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
virginia
and
in
those
two
courts,
the
decisions
of
the
deputy
commissioners
were
upheld.
i
might
point
out
that
as
part
of
the
facts
and
which
the
court
will
certainly
wish
to
consider,
is
that
these
piers
were
very
long
piers,
they
were
on
pilings.
they
did
extend
over
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states.
the
men
who
worked
on
these
piers
could
and
did
pass
freely
between
the
ship
and
the
pier.
now,
when
the
case
was
taken
from
the
district
court
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit,
they
were
first
argued
before
separate
panels
then
consolidated
and
argued
before
the
court
embank.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit
reversed
the
district
court
judges
in
the
eastern
district
of
virginia
and
in
the
district
of
maryland
and
in
a
five
to
two
decision
held
at
these
accidents
did
fall
within
the
coverage
of
the
longshoreman's
act.
the
case
was
then
presented
to
this
court,
certiorari
was
granted,
the
solicitor
general
applied
for
certiorari
on
behalf
of
the
two
deputy
commissioners,
we
applied
for
certiorari
on
behalf
of
the
stevedoring
companies
below,
certiorari
was
granted.
the
case
was
argued
initially
before
this
court
in
march
of
this
year
and
then
set
down
for
re-argument
today.
i
recall
that
in
the
initial
argument,
i
had
been
asked
whether
or
not
an
appeal
from
the
deputy
commissioner
came
up
in
admiralty
on
the
civil
side
and
i
replied
that
it
arose
on
the
admiralty
side
of
the
docket.
i
was
correct
so
far
as
maryland
was
concerned
but
i
was
not
fully
correct
because
i
find
that
it's
a
matter
of
local
practice
and
though
in
maryland,
those
appeals
come
up
in
admiralty.
in
the
avery
case
which
came
up
in
virginia,
the
local
practice
differed
and
it
came
up
on
the
civil
side.
you
can
see
the
caption
of
the
case
is
at
pages
11
and
12
of
the
appendix
and
page
35
of
the
appendix
in
our
cases.
mr.
randall
c.
coleman
yes,
sir.
mr.
randall
c.
coleman
your
honor,
i
don't
think
it
makes
any
practical
difference.
i
had
been
asked
the
question
how
they
arose
on
what
side.
i
find
it
it's
entirely
a
practice,
a
matter
of
local
practice
within
the
courts.
so,i
think
it
makes
no
difference
at
all,
it's
just
a
matter
what
the
clerk
says
you
do
and
in
maryland
they
say
you
do
it
in
admiralty
and
in
virginia
they
say
you
do
it
on
the
civil
side
that
they
were
simply
captioned
that
way.
the
thing
that
--
the
point
which
i
think
is
very
critical
in
this
case
and
which
was
entirely
overlooked
in
the
court
below
despite
the
fact
that
it
was
argued
in
the
briefs,
extensively
covered
and
the
two
opinions
of
the
district
judges
is
the
fact
that
these
injuries
occurred
on
piers
and
the
further
fact
that
a
long
line
of
decisions
has
held
without
any
question
that
piers
are
extensions
of
the
land.
i
think
probably
the
leading
case
is
this
court's
decision
in
1945,
it
was
announced
by
mr.
justice
black,
it
was
mr.
chief
justice
stone's
decision.
swanson
against
marra
brothers,
it
involved
a
pier
injury
when
swanson
was
injured
on
the
pier
as
a
result
of
a
life
raft
from
the
vessel
dropping
on
him,
falling
on
him
and
injuring
him.
in
speaking
of
the
longshoreman's
act
and
this
language
has
been
quoted
repeatedly
when
the
question
has
arisen,
the
court
said
but
this
act,
that's
the
longshoreman's
act,
is
restricted
to
compensation
for
injuries
occurring
on
navigable
waters.
it
excludes
from
its
own
terms
and
from
the
jones
act
any
remedies
against
the
employer
for
injuries
inflicted
on
shore.
the
act
leaves
the
injured
employees
in
such
cases
to
pursue
the
remedies
afforded
by
local
law
and
in
these
very
cases,
the
accidents
occurred
on
piers
and
compensation
in
all
three
cases
has
been
given
to
the
men
and
the
widow
of
mr.
closeck
under
the
state
act
because
they
were
considered
land
injuries.
mr.
randall
c.
coleman
i
was
quoting,
your
honor
the
swanson
against
marra
brothers,
the
one
your
honor
announced,
i
think
mr.
chief
justice
stone
wrote
the
opinion.
this
court
followed
in
swanson
against
marra
brothers
and
still
follows,
as
always
followed
the
line
of
demarcation
which
was
drawn
in
the
jensen
case,
southern
pacific
against
jensen,
if
your
honors
recall
involved
fatal
injuries
which
occurred
on
a
gangway.
that
gangway
was
considered
to
be
on
navigable
waters.
there
had
been
an
effort
to
give
new
york
compensation,
new
york
state
compensation
for
the
injuries
sustained
there
but
the
supreme
court
would
not
permit
it
saying
that
it
was
violative
of
the
constitution
and
the
line
that
was
drawn
in
jensen
followed
in
the
dawson
case,
followed
in
the
knickerbocker
case
the
triambride
that
has
frequently
been
referred
to
by
this
court
ever
since
that
decision,
those
decisions
was
the
line
between
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states
and
land
or
extensions
of
the
land
and
where
it
occurred
on
navigable
waters,
the
longshoreman's
act
apply
and
where
it
occurred
on
land
or
extensions
of
land,
the
state
acts
applied.
now,
these
injuries
did
not
occur
on
the
exception
that
is
included
in
the
longshoreman's
act
of
any
dry
dock.
a
pier
such
as
this
or
a
wharf
is
not
considered
a
dry
dock.
what
is
considered
a
dry
dock
has
been
considered
and
discussed
at
length
by
this
court
in
avendeo
marine
ways
against
henderson,
that
was
mr.
justice
douglas'
decision,
certainly
these
accidents
do
not
fall
within
the
twilight
zone
which
was
davis
against
department
of
labor.
the
twilight
zone
are
the
undefined
and
indefinable
areas
which
are
very
shadowy
but
there's
nothing
shadowy
in
this
instance
because
it
was
a
clearly
pier
injury
all
the
way
where
confusion
sometimes
arises
and
i
was
asked
a
number
of
questions
along
these
lines
at
the
last
argument,
is
where
the
impact
occurs
at
one
place
and
the
damage
which
ensues
occurs
somewhere
else.
this
court
has
been
uniform
in
its
holdings
of
how
to
apply
coverage
under
those
conditions.
i
can
--
i
intend
to
run
down
those
cases
very
quickly
if
i
may
in
the
admiral
people's
case
which
was
a
1935
decision
of
the
court,
a
passenger
who
fell
from
a
gangway
to
the
dock
was
injured
on
the
dock
and
it
was
held
that
that
was
within
the
admiralty
tort
jurisdiction
at
the
time
because
the
accident
or
the
tort
occurred
on
navigable
waters.
the
injury
that
is
the
damage
to
the
person
occurred
to
the
passenger,
occurred
when
he
hit
the
dock.
but
it
arose
the
tort,
the
wrong
occurred
on
navigable
waters.
it
approved
that
did
not
involve
the
longshoreman's
act
but
within
the
body
of
the
admiral
people's,
this
court
refer
to
the
reasoning
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
in
lahode
against
crawl
and
there,
the
longshoreman
had
completed
his
job
on
the
pier
was
being
hoisted
from
the
pier
in
a
sling
to
the
deck
of
the
ship.
he
smacked
the
sling
swung
against
the
side
of
the
ship
and
he
hit
the
side
of
the
ship,
that's
where
the
court
considered
that
the
accident
occurred,
he
fell
back
and
sustained
injuries
on
the
pier
and
the
supreme
court
in
the
admiral
people's
approved
of
that
finding
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit.
in
minnie
against
port
huron,
it
faced
the
problem
directly
involving
the
longshoreman.
it
denied,
this
court
denied
state
compensation
coverage
to
a
longshoreman
who
was
on
the
ship
when
he
was
swung
by
a
swinging
load
on
the
ship
and
not
to
the
pier.
it
was
held
that
the
accident
which
brought
about
the
damage
occurred
on
navigable
waters.
it
cited
with
approval
its
prior
decision,
it
reaffirmed
its
prior
decision
in
smith
and
son
against
taylor
which
was
a
1928
decision
that
state
law
covered
the
longshoreman
who
was
struck
by
a
swinging
load
on
the
pier
and
was
knocked
into
the
water
so
that
the
supreme
court
has
been
uniform
in
its
holding
that
where
the
tort
or
injury
occurs,
even
though
the
damage
from
it
occurs
elsewhere,
the
coverage
depends
upon
the
place
of
the
happening
of
the
accident,
of
the
tort
or
the
striking
or
the
wrong.
now,
i'm
bound
to
say
that
this
has
not
been
absolutely
uniformly
applied
in
all
of
the
circuits
but
it
has
been
uniformly
applied
in
the
supreme
court
and
there
is
absolutely
uniformity
when
the
accident
clearly
occurred
on
a
pier
or
clearly
occurred
on
navigable
waters.
there
has
been
no
holding
anywhere
by
any
court
except
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit
and
the
decision
below
that
when
an
accident
clearly
occurs
on
a
pier
and
in
this
case
both
the
impact
and
the
injury
occurred
on
the
pier,
there
has
never
been
a
holding
except
the
court
below
to
the
affect
that
that
should
be
covered
by
the
longshoreman's
act.
this
--
this
court
has
uniformly
applied
it
in
these
series
of
cases,
jensen,
knickerbocker,
dawson,
those
were
navigable
waters
cases
and
the
court
would
not
permit
compensation
under
the
state
compensation
acts
in
nordenholt
and
swanson
against
marra
brothers,
the
injuries
were
clearly
pier
injuries
and
there
the
court
applied
state
compensation.
the
latest
cases
in
the
circuits
are
the
travelers
against
shea
and
nicholson
against
calbeck
from
the
fifth
circuit.
there
they
were
clearly
pier
injuries.
it
was
held
that
there
was
no
compensation
under
the
longshoreman's
act
and
this
court
denied
certiorari
in
those
two
cases
in
1968.
the
ninth
circuit
made
the
same
holding
in
houser
against
o'leary
likewise
a
pier
injury
clearly,
unmistakably
just
as
in
this
case,
the
ninth
circuit
denied
coverage
under
the
longshoreman's
act
and
in
1968
this
court
denied
certiorari
so
the
only
exception
to
this
uniform
rule
of
all
the
circuits
and
this
court
is
the
decision
below.
it
relied
on
the
calbeck
case,
calbeck
against
traveler's
insurance
company,
reported
at
370
united
states
114.
since
the
court
did
rely
so
heavily
on
that,
i
would
like
to
go
into
it
if
i
may
rather
extensively
because
i
think
the
court
below
mistakenly
read
and
applied
the
calbeck
decision.
that
case
involved
injuries
to
two
or
more
shipyard
workers
who
sustained
injuries
on
ships
which
were
under
construction
and
on
navigable
waters.
now,
the
court
was
concerned
just
what
to
do
in
that
case
because
in
a
similar
case
which
this
court
had
decided
grant
smith-porter
ship
company
against
rohde,
the
court
had
held
that
in
new
construction,
a
state
act
applied.
they
were
fearful
that
there
might
be
a
gap
that
in
areas
such
as
the
new
construction
in
the
calbeck
against
traveler's
insurance
company
case,
there
might
be
no
coverage
at
all
so
what
the
court
did
hold
in
calbeck
was
that
there
could
be
coverage
under
either
act,
it
did
not
say
that
pier
injuries
or
land
injuries
were
covered
by
a
state
act.
what
it
said
repeatedly
over
and
over
again
was
that
irrespective
of
what
else
may
be
considered
in
this
case,
these
workmen
were
injured
on
navigable
waters.
it
said
it
over
and
over
again
and
the
court
held
that
since
the
injuries
to
the
men
in
the
calbeck
case
did
occur
upon
navigable
waters,
they
had
the
right
to
recover
under
the
longshoreman's
act.
now,
the
court
in
that
case
repeated
and
reaffirmed
its
adherence
to
the
jensen
line
of
demarcation.
it
referred
to
it
in
so
many
words,
the
line
again
is
that
which
has
been
drawn
and
clearly
established
for
42
years
between
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states
and
land
or
extensions
of
land.
it
referred
to
the
very
language
of
senate
report
973
which
has
been
quoted
extensively
in
the
descending
opinion
below
and
in
the
opinion
both
of
judges
watkins
and
hoffman
in
the
district
courts
as
a
language
which
shows
that
the
legislative
history
likewise
supports
such
a
finding,
senate
report
973
says
injuries
occurring
in
loading
or
unloading
are
not
covered
unless
they
occur
on
the
ship
or
between
the
wharf
and
the
ship
and
these
injuries
didn't
occur
on
the
ship,
nor
did
they
occur
between
the
wharf
and
the
ship,
they
occurred
on
the
pier.
the
court
below
likewise
held
and
considered
that
the
admiralty
extension
act
extended
and
expanded
the
coverage
of
the
longshoreman's
act.
i
think,
your
honors
that
the
court
below
was
mistaken
in
that.
the
admiralty
extension
act
did
indeed
expand
admiralty,
tort,
jurisdiction
to
torts
which
occurred
on
land
if
caused
by
a
vessel
on
navigable
waters
and
that's
all
the
admiralty
extension
act
did.
now.
that
does
not
mean
that
the
admiralty
extension
act
did
not
have
an
impact
on
these
very
cases
it's
by
virtue
of
the
admiralty
extension
act
that
this
mrs.
closeck
and
mr.
johnson
have
presently
pending
third
party
damage
claims
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
maryland
for
damages
as
a
result
of
this.
mr.
randall
c.
coleman
yes,
sir.
against
bethlehem
steel
company.
mr.
randall
c.
coleman
yes,
sir.
bethlehem
owns,
the
ship
was
the
beth
text.
no
sir,
bethlehem
owned
the
ship,
it
was
the
beth
text
and
--
mr.
randall
c.
coleman
unseaworthiness,
the
allegation
is,
if
i
remember
correctly
the
allegation
is
that
the
crane
which
was
on
the
ship
was
defective
and
in
someway
and
so
there
is
a
suit
pending
by
virtue
of
the
admiralty
extension
act
against
the
vessel
owner
and
that's
how
the
admiralty
extension
act
comes
into
play
in
this
type
of
accident.
it
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
longshoreman's
act
coverage.
now,
i
think
what
the
lower
court
failed
to
take
into
account
was
the
very
language
of
the
admiralty
extension
act
in
the
second
paragraph,
the
second
paragraph
of
the
admiralty
extension
act
refers
to
bringing
a
suit
in
rem
or
in
personam.
that's
not
what
happens
under
the
longshoreman's
act,
the
longshoreman's
act
is
an
administrative
claim,
you
don't
bring
your
suit,
you
don't
sue
in
rem
under
the
longshoreman's
act.
you
can
do
that
for
damages
by
virtue
of
the
expansion
of
admiralty
tort
jurisdiction.
it's
an
administrative
proceeding
under
the
longshoreman's
act
which
involves
no
suit
at
all,
it's
an
administrative
claim,
it's
brought
only
for
compensation,
a
claim
is
filed
rather
than
suit
so
i
think
the
lower
court
simply
did
not
take
into
account
the
legislative
history,
the
reasons,
the
purposes
of
the
act
or
anything
else
and
misread
the
clear
language.
that
act
was
passed
entirely
in
1948.
it
was
passed
in
order
to
rectify
certain
inequities
which
existed
when
people
who,
people
or
persons
which
existed
when
people
who,
people
or
persons
or
things
that
were
damaged
on
land
by
ships
on
navigable
waters
were,
until
the
passage
of
this
act
denied
the
right
to
an
admiralty
proceeding.
that
leads
your
honors,
into
a
brief
consideration
of
this
court's
decision
in
rodrigue
against
aetna
casualty
insurity
company.
that
case
was
decided
by
the
unanimous
court
after
the
argument
in
this
case
in
march
and
i
believe
the
rodrigue
case
may
have
been
argued
before
the
march
argument.
it
did
not
specifically
involve
the
longshoreman's
act
but
the
rodrigue
case
did
involve
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
in
which
the
court
held
that
congress
had
adopted
state
law
rather
than
federal
law
for
civil
actions
involving
wrong
for
depths
of
workers
employed
on
artificial
island
drilling
rigs.
now,
since
the
author
of
the
decision,
mr.
justice
white
did
refer
in
his
opinion
to
admiralty
jurisdiction
and
accidents
which
occurred
on
piers
located
above
navigable
waters,
it
seems
important
to
examine
that
language
in
the
light
of
this
case.
i
think
that
it's
perfectly
clear
from
all
the
existing
law
to
date
that
there
is
certainly
no
longshoreman's
act
coverage
for
land
injuries.
i
believe
your
honors
it's
also
clear
that
the
longshoreman's
act
extends
only
to
accidents
which
occurred
on
navigable
waters
and
there
can
be
admiralty
jurisdiction
of
course
where
there's
longshoreman's
act
coverage
but
there's
not
admiralty
jurisdiction
in
every,
i
mean
there's
not
longshoreman's
act
coverage
in
every
place
that
there's
admiralty
jurisdiction
because
we've
already
seen
that
the
admiralty
extension
act
gives
admiralty
jurisdiction
in
cases
like
gutierrez
case
where
a
ship
on
navigable
waters
causes
damage
to
shore.
now,
the
language
of
this
court
and
its
unanimous
opinion
in
rodrigue
just
very
recently
was
the
accidents
had
no
more
connection
with
the
ordinary
stuff
of
admiralty
than
do
accidents
on
piers.
mr.
justice
white
later
on
stated
the
accidents
would
be
no
more
under
admiralty
jurisdiction
than
accidents
on
a
wharf
located
above
navigable
waters.
if
that
is
what
this
court
thinks
as
a
law
that
is
what
this
case
is
all
about.
if
these
accidents
didn't
occur
on
navigable
waters,
if
this
case
doesn't
involve
admiralty
jurisdiction,
then
clearly
the
lower
court
have
to
be
wrong
and
that
was
the
decision
of
this
court
in
rodrigue
since
the
argument,
since
the
initial
argument
in
march
of
1969.
the
last
point
i
would
like
to
cover
is
the
continued
stress
by
the
respondents
below
by
the
longshoreman
that
it
is
so
unfair
to
longshoreman
who
happen
to
reside
in
virginia
and
maryland
not
to
be
able
to
receive
federal
compensation
because
federal
compensation
in
maryland
and
virginia
is
considerably
less
than
the
state
--
it
is
considerably
greater
than
the
state
compensation
in
those
two
states.
well,
one
it
seems
to
me
that
is
clearly
a
legislative
argument.
but
it
ignores
what
they're
planning
to
do
to
longshoreman
located
in
those
states
where
the
state
compensation
is
in
excess
of
the
federal
compensation.
i
know
for
example
as
there's
alaska,
california,
new
york
to
name
three.
thus,
if
in
fact
they
want
to
change
the
law
for
maryland
and
virginia,
they're
going
to
take
away
from
the
longshoreman
and
other
jurisdictions
what
those
states
provide.
if
the
congress
see
it's
fit
to
change
the
language
of
the
longshoreman's
act
or
if
the
states
see
fit
to
change
the
amount
of
compensation,
that
is
one
thing
but
i've
submit
your
honors
that
this
case
is
one
which
falls
clearly
within
the
language
of
the
longshoreman's
act.
it's
been
uniformly
decided
here
that
if
the
accidents
do
not
occur
on
navigable
waters,
they
are
not
covered
for
the
longshoreman's
act.
thank
you
sir.
