justice
byron
r.
white
did
you
suggest
that
the
admiralty
jurisdiction
at
its
maximum
extension
would
not
reach
an
injury
on
a
pier?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that.
i
understand
the
admiralty
but
you
--
a
while
ago
you
said
it
had
been
determined
that
the
maximum
extension
of
the
admiralty
jurisdiction
still
didn't
reach
injury
on
a
pier?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
do
say
that
admiralty
jurisdiction
ends
with
the
pier.
justice
byron
r.
white
admiralty
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
by
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
then
what
about
the
congress
saying
that
it
isn't,
but
i
suppose
it
could,
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
--
what
power
do
you
think
congress
was
exercising
in
passing
the
longshoreman's
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
was
the
power
of
congress,
i
suppose
in
passing
the
admiralty
extension
act
was
the
maritime
jurisdiction?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
as
review
of
the
district
court
on
the
civil-sided
court?
not
an
admiralty
--
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
an
admiralty?
justice
byron
r.
white
considered
an
admiralty
not
a
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
not
your
viewpoint.
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
was
it
reasonably
clear
before
the
admiralty
extension
act
that
injuries
on
a
pier
were
not
--
injuries
on
a
pier
to
a
longshoreman
were
not
actionable
in
admiralty?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
gave
rise
to
the
admiralty
extension
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
are
using
the
admiralty
extension
act
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
in
your
argument
aren't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
don't
know
what
gave
rise
to
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
was
the
so-called
jensen
line?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
did
the
jensen
case
defined
what
that
line
was
between
the
--
did
it
have
anything
to
do
with
docks
and
gangplanks
and
ships?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
some
of
the
cases
mean
when
they
say
that
the
longshoreman's
act
adopted
the
jensen
line?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
the
court
has
indicated
the
--
this
court
has
indicated
that
the
longshoreman's
act
adapted
the
jensen
line.
now,
whatever
that
line
is?
justice
byron
r.
white
hasn't
the
court
so
indicated
that
the
longshoreman's
act
adopted
the
jensen
line?
justice
byron
r.
white
between
what
demarcation?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
was
the
basis
for
this
court
(inaudible)
jurisdiction?
justice
byron
r.
white
one
that
a
seaman
or
a
long
--
a
seaman
that
was
injured
on
the
dock
couldn't
sue
the
vessel?
justice
byron
r.
white
were
they
ever
changed
or
overruled
that
you
know
of?
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
the
citation
of
that
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
whose
case
was
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
other
case
is
--
were
cases
in
this
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
strika
couldn't
very
well
overrule
them,
couldn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
if
you
look
at
the
legislative
history
of
the
admiralty
extension
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
know
why
it
was
passed?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
never
mind
then.
justice
byron
r.
white
thank
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
have
made
the
same
argument
prior
to
the
admiralty
extension
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
have
to
say
that
i
think.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
you're
going
to
rely
on
the
calbeck
statement,
you
would
have
to.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
--
how
do
you
characterize
cases
in
this
court
or
others
which
say
that
injuries
on
piers
are
not
within
the
admiralty
jurisdiction?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
what
are
those,
what
do
those
cases
represent,
an
announcement
as
to
what
the
limits
of
the
admiralty
jurisdiction
are?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
court
had
said,
i
think
prior
to
1927
that
the
admiralty
jurisdiction
did
not
reach
--
admiralty
tort
jurisdiction
did
not
reach
pier
injuries.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
you
say
that
calbeck
said
that
congress
intended
to
utilize
its
full
power.
justice
byron
r.
white
to
the
full
extent
of
the
admiralty
jurisdiction.
the
admiralty
jurisdiction
wouldn't
extend
landward
to
reach
pier
injuries
until
and
unless
the
limits
of
the
admiralty
jurisdiction
were
changed
either
by
decision
on
this
court
or
by
the
congress.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
day
after
the
longshoreman's
act,
you
would
have
argued
that
a
pier
injury
is
covered
by
the
longshoreman's
act.
justice
byron
r.
white
on
--
how
would
you
make
the
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
there
wasn't
any
void
on
the
pier.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
other
cases
have
said
that
the
state
can
go
up
to
the
gangplank.
justice
byron
r.
white
didn't
other
cases
always
state
to
go
to
the
gangplank?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
can
agree
with
that
and
still
ask
what
congress
intended
to
do
in
this
act.
was
it
in
just
to
fill
a
void
or
did
it
intend
to
duplicate?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
still
would
have
been
maritime
employment,
wouldn't
it
even
if
it
was
on
dry
land,
which
i
doubt
--
dry
dock.
wouldn't
it
have
been
maritime
employment
within
the
reach
of
congress
under
the
admiralty
jurisdiction?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
why
do
they
have
to
say
dry
docks
--
to
include
dry
docks
if
they
already
intended
to
exercise
the
full
scope
of
the
admiralty
jurisdiction.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
a
bridge?
justice
byron
r.
white
a
bridge
over
navigable
waters
but
resting
on

justice
byron
r.
white
it
may
be
that
but
in

you're

about

of
navigable

how
would

did

that
the

not
reach
an

justice
byron

i
understand
that.
i

so
you

admiralty

then

saying
that

what

you

in
