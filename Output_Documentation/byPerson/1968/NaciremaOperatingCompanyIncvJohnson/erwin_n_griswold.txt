mr.
griswold
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
in
this
case
is
solely
one
of
statutory
construction.
though
there
is
of
course
a
constitutional
background.
in
some
ways
as
mr.
justice
fortas
has
indicated,
it's
in
a
sort
of
never-never
land.
but
i
think
that
it
helps
if
we
focus
on
the
fact
that
we
are
dealing
with
the
construction
and
application
of
a
statute
which
was
passed
by
congress
in
1927
more
than
40
years
ago,
and
has
never
been
amended.
it's
appealing
to
think
that
the
time
has
come
when
the
statute
here
involved
should
be
given
a
broader
sweep
as
the
court
below
has
done.
but
it's
an
appeal
i
submit
that
should
be
resisted
in
the
interest
of
proper
allocation
of
governmental
powers.
we've
become
accustomed
to
growing
and
expanding
constructions
of
the
constitution,
and
there's
reason
for
this.
since
constitutions
are
often
written
in
general
terms
and
they
are
hard
to
change.
in
the
area
of
statutory
construction
though,
congress
always
has
the
power
to
amend
the
statute
if
it
thinks
that
is
desirable.
and
in
the
allocation
of
powers
between
the
great
branches
of
the
government,
it's
the
function
of
congress
to
amend
statutes
and
not
of
the
court.
as
this
court
itself
pointed
out
in
the
pillsbury
case
involving
the
longshoreman's
act
some
years
ago.
we
don't
contend
that
the
proper
construction
of
the
statutory
provision
is
a
matter
of
black
and
white,
as
legal
questions
rarely
are.
but
there
are
elements
which
we
believe
point
clearly
enough
to
a
decision.
the
relevant
language
is
in
section
903
of
title
33
and
is
set
out
just
about
the
middle
of
page
3
of
the
government's
brief.
beginning
with
fourth
line
of
that
provision,
i
would
call
attention
to
three
elements
in
the
statutory
language.
there
is
first,
occurring
upon
the
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states.
now,
upon
is
a
common
word
and
common
words
often
have
many
shades
of
meaning.
this
word
in
this
place
must
take
its
content
in
part
at
least
from
its
background,
the
most
important
element
of
which
was
the
jensen
case.
the
dictionary
definition
of
upon
is
short
and
sweet.
i
looked
it
up
this
morning
in
the
second
edition
of
the
webster's
international
“upward
so
as
to
be
on.”
and
that
makes
it
turn
to
on
and
on
as
defined
as
the
position
of
contact
with
or
against
a
supporting
surface.
i
don't
think
the
dictionary
definition
helps
a
great
deal,
but
it
does
make
it
apparent
that
here
the
men
were
upon
the
pier
and
not
upon
the
water.
but
in
addition
to
the
jensen
case,
there
was
also
the
nordenholt
case
and
not
to
mention
the
cleveland
terminal
and
valley
railroad
case,
both
of
which
were
well
known
when
the
statute
was
written.
in
both
of
those
cases,
pier
injuries
were
held
to
be
outside
the
admiralty
jurisdiction.
it
said
that
these
piers
were
above
the
water,
and
that
indeed
small
boats
and
canoes
can
travel
beneath
the
piers
on
the
water.
but
that's
not
where
the
injury
occurred.
it
occurred
on
a
pier
which
is
a
structure
fixed
in
land.
now
when
these
workmen
were
on
the
pier,
they
were
above
the
water
surely,
but
they
were
not
upon
the
water
they
were
upon
the
pier.
suppose
they've
been
on
a
bridge
over
the
water
but
resting
on
the
two
banks
of
the
navigable
stream?
they
would
then
have
been
above
the
water,
and
thus
upon
the
water
in
the
same
sense
that
they
were
here.
but
no
one
would
say
that
a
person
on
a
bridge
was
upon
that
water
even
though
ships
could
pass
underneath.
next,
we
come
to
the
phrase
immediately
following
(including
any
dry
dock).
note
that
this
is
including
any
dry
dock,
not
any
dock
or
any
dock
or
pier.
the
fact
that
congress
expressly
included
any
dry
dock
is
some
indication
that
it
did
not
include
other
docks
or
piers.
i
don't
suggest
that
the
other
construction
is
impossible.
i
do
submit
that
it
is
unlikely
and
that
the
construction
which
would
make
the
applicable
--
the
act
applicable
to
injuries
occurring
on
any
dock
or
pier
is
not
only
unnatural
in
the
light
of
the
situation
which
congress
understood
when
it
wrote
the
statute.
but
also
makes
this
phrase
of
little
use
in
the
statute.
such
a
construction
should
i
think
be
avoided.
and
finally,
in
these
same
few
lines
of
the
statute,
we
come
to
the
last
clause
and
if
recovery
for
the
disability
or
death
through
workman's
compensation
proceedings
may
not
validly
be
provided
by
state
law.
now
it's
said
that
this
last
clause
was
written
out
of
the
statute
by
this
court's
decision
in
the
calbeck
case.
i'm
planning
to
devote
the
final
portion
of
my
available
time
to
a
discussion
of
the
calbeck
case,
but
i
will
say
now
that
i
don't
think
the
statement
i
have
just
recounted
is
true.
writing
provisions
out
of
the
statute
is
not
the
function
of
the
court.
and
i
don't
interpret
the
calbeck
decision
as
attempting
to
do
so.
on
the
contrary,
the
present
case
is
i
submit
an
excellent
example
of
a
situation
where
this
final
clause
is
applicable
and
is
dispositive
of
the
question
of
construction
and
of
the
litigation.
turning
specifically
to
the
question
of
construction,
i've
already
referred
to
the
language
of
the
statute
but
the
argument
is
confirmed
by
the
legislative
history.
the
statute
including
this
jurisdictional
language
was
of
course
passed
following
the
jensen
decision
and
the
two
cases
where
the
court
struck
down
the
first
two
attempts
of
congress
to
deal
with
the
problem.
not
only
was
the
jensen
case
there
was
clear
territorial
implications,
but
this
court
had
already
decided
the
nordenholt
case
in
259
u.s.
in
an
opinion
by
mr.
justice
mcreynolds
who
was
the
author
of
the
jensen
opinion.
and
the
court
held
that
an
injury
to
a
longshoreman
on
a
pier
was
covered
by
the
state
workers'
compensation
law.
this
is
no
--
this
was
no
mere
straining
to
find
some
way
to
provide
compensation.
the
court
in
its
opinion
referred
to
the
doctrine
that
locality
and
i'm
quoting
“locality
is
the
exclusive
test
of
admiralty
jurisdiction.”
it
said,
eisends
who
was
the
injured
workman,
was
injured
upon
the
dock,
an
extension
of
the
land,
“see
cleveland
terminal
and
valley
railroad
company
against
cleveland
steamship
company.”
this
was
the
setting
in
which
congress
legislated.
its
understanding
was
made
explicit
in
the
report
of
the
senate
committee
which
is
set
forth
on
page
13
of
the
government's
brief.
now
the
senate
report
said
that
injuries
occurring
in
loading
or
unloading
are
not
covered
unless
they
occur
on
the
ship
or
between
the
wharf
and
the
ship
so
as
to
bring
them
within
the
maritime
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states.
in
the
process
of
enacting
the
statute,
we
have
further
evidence.
for
there
was
at
one
time
in
the
bills
as
they
went
through
congress
a
general
provision
that
it
should
apply
to
any
employment
performed
on
a
place
within
the
admiralty
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states,
except
employment
of
local
concern,
and
of
no
direct
relation
to
navigation
or
commerce.
all
of
which
would
have
been
very
uncertain
in
scope
and
would
have
yielded
would've
meant
itself
to
a
construction
in
this
case
in
accordance
with
that
of
the
court
below.
but
congress
took
that
out
and
substituted
in
its
place
the
language
which
has
persisted
unchanged
for
more
than
40
years
upon
the
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states
including
any
dry
dock.
this
showed
a
clearly
territorial
approach
which
is
surely
understandable
in
the
light
of
the
decisions
as
they
stood
at
that
time.
next,
i
would
point
out
that
this
was
the
immediate
and
long
continued
consistent
administrative
construction
of
the
statute
which
should
be
given
great
weight
at
this
late
day.
almost
at
once,
and
in
a
long
series
of
rulings,
the
administrative
agency
charged
with
the
application
of
the
statute
construed
it
not
to
apply
to
pier
side
injuries
as
it
has
done
in
this
case.
and
finally,
since
the
statute
was
enacted,
this
court's
decisions
lead
to
the
same
conclusion
as
long
ago
as
1941.
this
court
said
in
parker
against
motor
boat
sales
and
i
quote,
“the
field
in
which
a
state
may
not
validly
provide
for
compensation
must
be
taken
for
the
purposes
of
the
act
as
the
same
field
which
the
jensen
line
of
decision
excluded
from
state
compensation
laws.”
without
affirming
or
rejecting
the
constitutional
implications
of
those
cases,
we
accept
them
as
the
measure
by
which
congress
intended
to
mark
the
scope
of
the
act
they
brought
into
existence.
and
shortly
thereafter
in
davis
against
the
department
of
labor,
the
court
said
that
“congress
as
by
the
longshoreman's
act
accepted
the
jensen
line
of
demarcation
between
state
and
federal
jurisdiction.”
and
more
specifically
in
swanson
against
marra
bros.
company,
to
which
mr.
coleman
has
referred,
the
court
held
almost
directly
that
a
pier
side
injury
was
covered
by
the
longshoreman's
act
citing
and
relying
on
the
nordenholt
case.
i
turn
now
to
the
calbeck
case,
which
is
of
course
an
important
authority
in
the
construction
of
the
longshoreman's
act.
my
submission
is
that
it
supports
our
construction
of
the
statute.
some
language
in
it
is
taken
out
of
context
to
sustain
the
contrary
argument.
but
that
argument
will
not
survive,
i
submit,
when
the
language
is
placed
in
the
context
of
the
decision
as
a
whole.
in
the
first
place,
we
must
give
consideration
to
the
actual
facts
of
the
calbeck
case.
the
language
of
an
opinion
of
course
takes
significance
as
applied
to
the
facts
which
were
before
the
court.
and
in
the
calbeck
case,
the
court
was
dealing
with
an
injury
to
an
employee
who
was
working
on
a
ship
which
was
afloat
on
navigable
waters.
this
is
the
clearest
possible
situation
within
the
admiralty
jurisdiction
and
within
the
jensen
case.
the
workmen
there
were
on
the
water
side
of
the
jensen
line
of
demarcation.
and
what
the
court
said
has
great
relevance
to
injuries
which
are
so
clearly
maritime
that
this
was
the
area
on
which
the
court
focused
is
clearly
shown
by
the
repeated
references
in
the
opinion
to
“injuries
incurred
on
navigable
waters.”
this
phrase
occurs
at
least
nine
times
in
the
opinion
with
slight
variations.
as
to
such
injuries,
the
court
did
use
some
rather
broad
language,
but
it
was
only
such
injuries
that
were
actually
before
the
court.
that
the
court
did
not
intend
to
go
further
is
shown
by
its
reference
to
the
ex-adoption
of,
and
here
again
i
quote
“the
jensen
line
between
admiralty
and
state
jurisdiction
as
the
limit
of
federal
coverage.”
and
its
reference
to
the
fact
that
in
davis
against
the
department
of
labor,
the
court
had
pointed
out
that,
and
again
i
quote
“the
act
adopts
the
jensen
line
of
demarcation.”
it
should
be
observed
too
that
the
in
the
calbeck
case,
the
court
at
page
129
cited
the
nordenholt
case
with
approval.
where
it
had
been
held
just
before
the
enactment
of
the
statute,
that
injuries
on
piers
were
on
the
state
authority
side
of
the
jensen
line
of
demarcation.
thus,
calbeck
when
closely
examined
deals
only
with
the
water
side
of
the
jensen
act
of
demarcation.
it
accepts
--
mr.
griswold
yes,
i
think
the
floating
dock
might
be
the
equivalent
of
a
vessel,
i
don't
know.
then
it
would
be
upon
navigable
waters.
i
can
only
say
that
we
don't
have
that
case
here.
mr.
griswold
certainly
a
barge
floating
beside
a
ship
which
is
being
used
in
unloading
a
ship
would
be
within
the
admiralty
jurisdiction.
and
i
don't
recall
a
case
which
has
involved
a
floating
pier.
but
i
think
that
it's
very
likely
that
that
would
be
held
to
be
within
the
admiralty
jurisdiction.
certainly,
it
was
not
the
situation
which
was
involved
in
the
nordenholt
case
which
was
a
fixed
structure
built
on
land.
calbeck
as
i
have
said
does
accept
the
nordenholt
case
and
makes
it
plain
that
a
pier
side
injury
such
as
that
involved
here
is
and
always
has
been
understood
to
be
covered
by
the
state
acts.
and
is
thus
outside
the
scope
of
the
longshoreman's
act
not
only
because
the
injury
is
on
the
state
side
of
the
jensen
line
of
demarcation,
but
also
because
coverage
of
the
longshoreman's
act
is
expressly
excluded
by
the
final
clause
of
section
3
(a)
since
a
remedy
under
the
state
act
is
clearly
available.
and
this
is
the
case
it
seems
to
me
where
that
final
clause
can
properly
be
applied.
in
the
calbeck
case,
the
court
did
quote
some
rather
expansive
language
from
judge
hutcheson
in
the
de
bardeleben
coal
case.
but
nevertheless,
the
case
itself
involves
injuries
which
were
clearly
on
the
water
side
of
the
jensen
line
of
demarcation.
congress
did
undertake
to
use
its
authority
to
the
full
as
it
then
understood
its
authority
to
be
under
this
court's
decisions.
in
undertaking
to
meet
its
responsibility,
it
drew
the
line
which
it
understood
to
be
the
jensen
line
of
demarcation
to
which
this
court
has
frequently
since
made
reference.
though
it
may
be
that
it
could
draw
the
line
some
place
else
if
it
were
enacting
the
statute
now,
and
i
think
it
could.
this
is
the
place
where
it
did
draw
the
line
when
it
enacted
this
statute
in
1927.
nothing
that
has
happened
since
is
an
appropriate
reason
for
a
court
to
draw
the
line
someplace
else
that
is
the
responsibility
and
the
prerogative
of
congress.
mr.
griswold
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
since
this
is
a
re-argument,
i
have
tried
to
think
of
ways
in
which
i
could
be
of
assistance
to
the
court
and
it
has
seemed
to
me
that
i
might
focus
primarily
on
the
two
aspects
of
the
case
which
has
been
so
well
covered
by
mr.
coleman.
the
first
is
to
emphasize
again
the
fact
that
this
case
involves
purely
a
question
of
statutory
construction.
it
is
not
a
question
of
constitutional
laws.
the
statute
is
set
forth
at
pages
two
to
four
of
the
government's
brief
and
the
immediately
relevant
language
is
that
in
section
three
of
the
act
about
three
inches
below
the
top
of
page
three.
compensation
shall
be
payable
under
this
chapter
in
respect
to
disability
or
death
of
an
employee
but
only
if
the
disability
or
death
results
from
an
injury
and
here
are
the
crucial
words,
occurring
upon
the
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states,
including
any
dry
dock,
and
if
recovery
for
the
disability
or
death
through
workman's
compensation
proceedings
may
not
be
validly
provided
by
state
law.
i
think
it
is
significant
that
that
language
does
not
say
within
the
maritime
or
admiralty
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
nor
does
it
say
as
far
as
congress
may
validly
make
federal
law
apply.
on
the
contrary,
the
way
the
statute
is
worded
shows
that
congress
was
trying
to
restrict
the
scope
of
federal
law
and
was
endeavoring
to
have
state
law
applied
whenever
it
could
but
it
knew
that
there
were
areas
where
state
law
could
not
apply
and
therefore
it
felt
compelled
to
enact
this
statute
to
provide
a
remedy
for
those
who
were
outside
and
the
scope
of
state
law.
not
for
those
who
were
inside
the
scope
of
federal
law
but
for
those
who
were
outside
the
scope
of
state
law.
now,
this
statute
was
passed
on
march
4,
1927
and
i
suggest
that
the
crucial
question
is
the
understanding
of
congress
in
1927
when
that
statute
was
written
and
not
what
the
constitutional
law
was
then,
not
what
the
constitutional
law
would
be
now
but
what
was
the
common
understanding
and
apprehension.
a
person's
familiar
with
this
problem
in
1927.
now,
that
of
course
goes
back
to
the
fact
that
state
workmen's
compensation
laws
were
enacted
beginning
about
1912.
no
federal
workman's
compensation
law.
in
the
jensen
case
which
came
to
this
court
in
1917
but
which
involved
an
injury
which
occurred
in
1913
or
1914,
the
facts
were
that
the
injury
occurred
to
a
man
who
was
operating
a
truck
on
a
gangway
between
a
pier
and
the
ship.
he
backed
into
the
ship,
his
head
was
hit
on
the
back
by
the
ship
as
he
was
moving
his
truck
in
and
he
was
killed.
the
accident
occurred
on
a
gangway
but
above
navigable
water
and
the
actual
impact
was
with
the
ship
itself.
and
then
the
case
of
southern
pacific
company
against
jensen,
decided
in
1917.
the
court
held
that
that
was
within
the
maritime
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
that
the
law
as
to
that
must
be
uniform
and
that
couldn't
be
if
the
state
law
is
applied
and
it
was
beyond
the
territorial
jurisdiction
of
the
legislative
power
of
the
states.
now
it
isn't
relevant,
it
seems
to
me
whether
that
was
right
or
sound
or
was
a
decision
which
the
court
would
now
follow.
that
was
the
decision
which
was
made
and
was
the
important
part
of
the
background
of
the
statute
which
congress
enacted
ten
years
later.
then
there
is
another
decision
which
came
before
the
statute,
state
industrial
commission
against
nordenholt
decided
in
1922.
that
was
also
a
proceeding
under
the
new
york
workman's
compensation
act.
for
the
death
of
a
longshoreman
who
was
injured
on
a
dock
while
engaged
in
unloading
cement
from
a
ship.
his
job
was
to
receive
the
bags
of
cement
and
pile
them
on
the
dock
in
tiers.
he
fell
from
the
pile
of
bags
to
the
floor
of
the
dock.
the
opinion
says
it
was
a
dock,
there's
nothing
to
indicate
whether
it
was
a
pier
or
a
wharf
and
i
don't
think
that
makes
any
difference
so
wharf
being
parallel
with
the
shore
and
a
pier
extending
into
the
water
away
from
the
shore.
and
the
court
held
in
an
opinion
by
mr.
justice
mcreynolds
that
the
state
compensation
law
could
apply
and
in
the
opinion,
justice
mcreynolds
referred
to
and
i
quote
“the
doctrine
that
locality
is
the
exclusive
test
of
admiralty
jurisdiction.”
hesona
who
was
the
workman
was
injured
upon
the
dock,
an
extension
of
the
land,
see
cleveland
terminal
and
valley
railroad
company
against
cleveland
steamship
company
in
208
u.s.
and
that
was
a
case
where
a
ship
had
hit
some
docks
or
piles
over
water
and
the
protecting
piling
of
the
bridge,
it
was
an
admiralty
case,
liable
against
the
ship.
it
was
held
that
it
was
not
within
the
admiralty
jurisdiction.
the
result
of
that
case
might
well
be
changed
by
the
extension
of
the
admiralty
act
but
it
is
important
and
that
it
was
the
basis
cited
as
a
basis
for
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
nordenholt
case
in
1922.
during
this
period,
congress
made
two
efforts
to
provide
compensation
for
longshoreman.
one
was
by
an
amendment
of
the
jurisdictional
provision
with
respect
to
jurisdiction
of
federal
courts
and
the
other
was
by
a
statute
which
in
effect
undertook
to
say
that
it
is
the
will
of
congress
that
state
compensation
act
should
apply
to
injuries
to
longshoreman
whether
on
land
or
in
water.
in
both
situations,
this
court
held
that
the
acts
of
congress
were
unconstitutional,
were
beyond
the
power
of
congress
because
of
the
requirement
the
court
found
that
the
admiralty
power
should
be
exercised
on
a
uniform
basis
throughout
the
united
states.
i
mentioned
that
because
it
shows
plainly
that
congress
had
had
its
fingers
burned
and
the
draftsman
of
the
statute
in
1927
were
not
reaching
out
but
were
careful
to
avoid
any
possible,
a
constitutional
pitfalls.
and
this
is,
made
apparent,
not
only
by
the
wording
of
the
statute
to
which
i
have
referred
but
also
by
the
committee
report
at
that
time
which
was
quoted
by
mr.
coleman,
senate
report
number
973
on
the
bill
which
became
the
longshoreman's
act
where
the
committee
referred
to
the
fact
that
injuries
incurring
in
loading
or
unloading
are
not
covered
unless
they
occur
on
the
ship
or
between
the
wharf
and
the
ship
and
what
could
be
a
clearer
reference
to
the
jensen
case
than
that.
so
as
to
bring
them
within
the
maritime
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states,
not
as
we
now
conceive
it,
not
as
it
might
have
been
conceived
then
but
is
it
had
been
defined
by
this
court
in
the
jensen
case
and
the
two
which
followed.
and
not
only
do
we
have
that
clear
statement
in
the
legislative
history
in
1927
but
we
also
have
the
contemporaneous
administrative
construction
which
is
cited
on
page
17
of
our
brief,
twice
in
1927
within
a
few
months
after
the
statute
was
passed,
again
in
1928
and
continuously
thereafter
right
down
to
these
two
cases.
the
administrative
construction
by
the
agency
chartered
with
administering
this
act
has
been
to
draw
the
line
between
ships,
gangways
to
ships
on
the
one
end
and
piers
on
the
other.
i
think
it's
also
not
irrelevant
to
point
out
a
decision
of
this
court
in
1928
which
is
just
a
year
after
the
longshoreman's
act
was
passed.
this
case
did
not
involve
the
longshoreman's
act
but
it
does
show
the
clearly
enough
the
state
of
thinking
at
that
time
which
is
the
state
of
thinking
which
determine
the
intension
of
congress
in
drafting
the
longshoreman's
act.
this
is
t.
smith
and
son
incorporated
against
taylor
in
276
u.s.
and
opinion
by
mr.
justice
butler.
there
the
deceased
was
a
longshoreman.
he
was
working
on
a
staging
and
it
rested
solely
upon
the
wharf
and
projected
a
few
feet
over
the
water
to
and
near
the
side
of
the
vessel.
he
was
engaged
in
unloading
the
vessel
when
a
sling
loaded
with
five
sacks
of
soda
weighing
200
pounds
each
was
being
lowered
over
the
side
by
means
of
a
winch
on
the
vessel.
the
sling
struck
the
deceased
and
knocked
him
off
the
stage
into
the
water
where
he
was
sometime
later
found
dead.
the
court
referred
to
the
fact
that
the
stage
and
wharf
on
which
deceased
was
working
are
to
be
deemed
an
extension
of
land
and
that's
quotation,
citing
the
cleveland
terminal
case.
and
said
again
on
page
182
the
blow
by
the
sling
was
what
gave
rise
to
the
cause
of
action.
it
was
given
and
took
effect
while
the
deceased
was
upon
the
land.
it
was
the
sole,
immediate
and
proximate
cause
of
his
death
and
the
court
concluded
that
the
state
law
should
apply.
after
that
we
have
some
interval
until
1941
and
several
cases
thereafter.
in
two
decisions
written
by
justice
black
in
1941
and
in
1942,
and
an
opinion
by
mr.
justice
reed
in
1953
and
most
recently
in
mr.
justice
brennan's
opinion
in
the
calbeck
case,
the
court
referred
in
these
words
to
the
jensen
line
of
demarcation
as
something
which
was
established,
known
and
accepted
and
it's
perfectly
plain
of
course
that
the
jensen
line
of
demarcation
is
the
line
between
the
water
and
the
land
and
specifically
as
applied
to
this
type
of
occasion
between
the
water
and
the
pier
because
there
are
numerous
cases
of
which
perhaps
the
nordenholt
case
is
the
most
significant
which
hold
that
the
pier
is
an
extension
of
the
land,
is
a
part
of
the
land
and
is
to
be
treated
as
the
land
for
that
purpose.
one
of
the
significant
cases
in
this
period
is
the
one
to
which
mr.
coleman
has
referred,
swanson
against
the
marra
brothers,
one
of
the
very
final
opinions
of
chief
justice
stone
in
328
u.s.
that
is
significant
here
i
think
because
it
was
a
longshoreman
working
on
a
pier
loading
cargo
and
he
was
injured
when
a
life
raft
fell
from
the
vessel
and
injured
him.
and
the
court
decided
there
that
the
longshoreman's
act
excludes
from
its
own
terms
and
from
the
jones
act
any
remedies
against
the
employer
for
injuries
inflicted
on
shore
and
it
went
on
to
refer
and
this
is
quoted
on
page
16
of
our
brief
that
to
land
torts
and
plainly
contemplated
that
this
injury
to
this
workman
who
is
a
longshoreman
working
on
a
pier
was
a
land
tort.
and
so
we
feel
that
the
setting
in
which
the
statute
was
drafted
makes
it
quite
plain
that
congress
was
seeking
to
find
and
to
lay
down
the
jensen
line
of
demarcation,
that
that
line
had
been
made
very
clear
by
the
decision
of
this
court
at
that
time
that
this
was
expressly
referred
to
and
adopted
by
the
congressional
committee
reports
at
the
time
that
current
administrative
practice
was
in
the
court
and
that
this
court
has
ever
since
in
numerous
cases
reiterated
the
fact
that
the
line
has
been
drawn
as
the
jensen
line
of
demarcation.
mr.
griswold
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
before
the
recess
i
tried
to
outline
some
of
the
background
describing,
defining
the
situation
within
which
congress
acted
when
it
legislated
in
1927.
i
referred
to
the
nordenholt
case
decided
by
this
court
in
1922
involving
a
pier
injury
and
i
would
like
simply
o
supplement
that
by
referring
also
to
the
court's
opinion
in
washington
against
dawson
and
company
in
1924
and
that
was
a
case
which
held
invalid
the
second
effort
of
congress
to
make
state
workman's
compensation
acts
applicable.
in
the
dawson
opinion,
the
court
said
on
page
227
industrial
commission
against
nordenholt
company
related
to
a
claim
based
upon
death
which
resulted
from
injuries
received
by
the
longshoreman
while
along
the
dock-a
matter
never
within
the
admiralty
jurisdiction.
now,
whether
that
is
right
or
not,
whether
that
is
what
this
court
would
now
hold
seems
to
me
not
significant,
that
is
what
this
court
declared
in
1924
and
that
was
the
most
recent
basis
upon
which
the
congress
could
act
when
it
drafted
the
statute
which
was
enacted
in
1927.
mr.
griswold
mr.
justice
mcreynolds.
nearly
all
of
the
opinions
in
this
area
in
that
period
were
of
mr.
justice
mcreynolds'.
now
in
concluding
my
portion
of
the
argument,
i
would
like
to
refer
as
mr.
coleman
did
to
the
rodrigue
case
decided
last
june.
that
case
had
a
of
course
somewhat
parallel
to
this
case.
it
was
argued
in
february.
this
case
was
argued
in
march.
on
may
19th,
the
court
set
this
case
down
for
re-argument.
on
june
7th,
it
decided
the
rodrigue
case.
and
i
had
a
relatively
leisurely
opportunity
over
the
summer
to
consider
the
rodrigue
opinion
and
its
application
to
this
case
and
i
must
confess
that
i
have
not
been
able
to
find
out
any
basis
upon
which
i
can
come
to
any
other
conclusion
than
that
the
rodrigue
opinion
in
effect
decides
this
case.
mr.
coleman
referred
to
some
of
the
passages,
i
have
marked
half
a
dozen
of
them.
on
page
355
the
court
said
since
the
seas
act
does
not
apply
of
its
own
force
under
admiralty
principles
and
since
the
lands
act
deliberately
as
to
the
application
of
admiralty
principles
to
these
noble
structures,
louisiana
is
not
ousted
by
the
seas
act.
and
on
page
359,
the
act
regresses
only
those
that's
stemming
from
wrongful
actions
or
omissions
occurring
on
the
high
seas
and
these
cases
involve
a
series
of
events
on
artificial
islands.
admiralty
jurisdiction
has
not
been
construed
to
extend
to
accidents
on
piers,
jetties,
bridges
or
even
ramps
or
railways
running
into
the
sea.
and
again
on
page
360,
it
was
an
island
albeit
an
artificial
one
and
the
accidents
had
no
more
connection
with
the
ordinary
stuff
of
admiralties
than
do
accidents
on
piers.
and
finally
on
page
361,
in
these
circumstances,
the
seas
act
which
provides
an
action
in
admiralty
clearly
would
not
apply
under
conventional
admiralty
principles
since
these
were
structured
and
careful
scrutiny
of
the
hearings
shows
that
it
was
the
view
that
maritime
law
was
inapposite
to
these
fixed
structures
and
there
is
finally
a
considerable
reliance
on
the
fact
that
the
employees
on
these
structures
are
land
based,
that
they
go
back
and
forth
to
their
homes
on
land
and
of
course
that
is
equally
applicable
to
the
longshoreman
and
who
are
involved
here.
i
will
have
only
one
final
point
to
make
which
is
with
respect
to
the
calbeck
case
which
is
a
rather
broad
and
sweeping
opinion
but
i
would
point
out
that
it
deals
entirely
with
the
water
side
of
the
jensen
line
of
demarcation.
it
says
that
on
the
water
side,
the
longshoreman
act
is
intended
to
be
provided
broadly
and
comprehensively.
there
is
nothing
in
the
decision
and
little
in
the
language
in
the
calbeck
opinion
which
has
any
reference
whatever
to
the
land
side.
this
case
involves
something
on
the
land
side.
it
may
be
arbitrary
to
draw
the
line
at
that
particular
point.
it
is
of
course
arbitrary
to
draw
that
any
point
the
line
might
well
had
been
sensible
to
have
said
that
longshoreman
are
governed
by
state
acts
but
then
we
would
have
had
seamen
who
were
governed
clearly
by
admiralty.
we
would
have
had
men
working
side
by
side
getting
different
benefits.
if
the
longshoreman's
act
was
extended
to
longshoreman
no
matter
where
they
were,
we
would
have
all
kinds
of
problems
about
how
far
inland
extended
and
we
would
again
have
people
working
side
by
side
getting
different
benefits.
it's
our
view
that
the
line
had
been
clearly
and
firmly
drawn,
whether
rightly
or
not
at
the
edge
of
the
water,
either
on
the
shore
or
on
a
pier
at
the
time
the
1927
act
was
passed
that
that
is
the
line
which
congress
adopted
that
this
court
has
repeatedly
referred
to
the
jensen
line
of
demarcation
and
that
should
be
controlling
here.
mr.
griswold
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
in
this
case
is
solely
one
of
statutory
construction.
though
there
is
of
course
a
constitutional
background.
in
some
ways
as
mr.
justice
fortas
has
indicated,
it's
in
a
sort
of
never-never
land.
but
i
think
that
it
helps
if
we
focus
on
the
fact
that
we
are
dealing
with
the
construction
and
application
of
a
statute
which
was
passed
by
congress
in
1927
more
than
40
years
ago,
and
has
never
been
amended.
it's
appealing
to
think
that
the
time
has
come
when
the
statute
here
involved
should
be
given
a
broader
sweep
as
the
court
below
has
done.
but
it's
an
appeal
i
submit
that
should
be
resisted
in
the
interest
of
proper
allocation
of
governmental
powers.
we've
become
accustomed
to
growing
and
expanding
constructions
of
the
constitution,
and
there's
reason
for
this.
since
constitutions
are
often
written
in
general
terms
and
they
are
hard
to
change.
in
the
area
of
statutory
construction
though,
congress
always
has
the
power
to
amend
the
statute
if
it
thinks
that
is
desirable.
and
in
the
allocation
of
powers
between
the
great
branches
of
the
government,
it's
the
function
of
congress
to
amend
statutes
and
not
of
the
court.
as
this
court
itself
pointed
out
in
the
pillsbury
case
involving
the
longshoreman's
act
some
years
ago.
we
don't
contend
that
the
proper
construction
of
the
statutory
provision
is
a
matter
of
black
and
white,
as
legal
questions
rarely
are.
but
there
are
elements
which
we
believe
point
clearly
enough
to
a
decision.
the
relevant
language
is
in
section
903
of
title
33
and
is
set
out
just
about
the
middle
of
page
3
of
the
government's
brief.
beginning
with
fourth
line
of
that
provision,
i
would
call
attention
to
three
elements
in
the
statutory
language.
there
is
first,
occurring
upon
the
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states.
now,
upon
is
a
common
word
and
common
words
often
have
many
shades
of
meaning.
this
word
in
this
place
must
take
its
content
in
part
at
least
from
its
background,
the
most
important
element
of
which
was
the
jensen
case.
the
dictionary
definition
of
upon
is
short
and
sweet.
i
looked
it
up
this
morning
in
the
second
edition
of
the
webster's
international
“upward
so
as
to
be
on.”
and
that
makes
it
turn
to
on
and
on
as
defined
as
the
position
of
contact
with
or
against
a
supporting
surface.
i
don't
think
the
dictionary
definition
helps
a
great
deal,
but
it
does
make
it
apparent
that
here
the
men
were
upon
the
pier
and
not
upon
the
water.
but
in
addition
to
the
jensen
case,
there
was
also
the
nordenholt
case
and
not
to
mention
the
cleveland
terminal
and
valley
railroad
case,
both
of
which
were
well
known
when
the
statute
was
written.
in
both
of
those
cases,
pier
injuries
were
held
to
be
outside
the
admiralty
jurisdiction.
it
said
that
these
piers
were
above
the
water,
and
that
indeed
small
boats
and
canoes
can
travel
beneath
the
piers
on
the
water.
but
that's
not
where
the
injury
occurred.
it
occurred
on
a
pier
which
is
a
structure
fixed
in
land.
now
when
these
workmen
were
on
the
pier,
they
were
above
the
water
surely,
but
they
were
not
upon
the
water
they
were
upon
the
pier.
suppose
they've
been
on
a
bridge
over
the
water
but
resting
on
the
two
banks
of
the
navigable
stream?
they
would
then
have
been
above
the
water,
and
thus
upon
the
water
in
the
same
sense
that
they
were
here.
but
no
one
would
say
that
a
person
on
a
bridge
was
upon
that
water
even
though
ships
could
pass
underneath.
next,
we
come
to
the
phrase
immediately
following
(including
any
dry
dock).
note
that
this
is
including
any
dry
dock,
not
any
dock
or
any
dock
or
pier.
the
fact
that
congress
expressly
included
any
dry
dock
is
some
indication
that
it
did
not
include
other
docks
or
piers.
i
don't
suggest
that
the
other
construction
is
impossible.
i
do
submit
that
it
is
unlikely
and
that
the
construction
which
would
make
the
applicable
--
the
act
applicable
to
injuries
occurring
on
any
dock
or
pier
is
not
only
unnatural
in
the
light
of
the
situation
which
congress
understood
when
it
wrote
the
statute.
but
also
makes
this
phrase
of
little
use
in
the
statute.
such
a
construction
should
i
think
be
avoided.
and
finally,
in
these
same
few
lines
of
the
statute,
we
come
to
the
last
clause
and
if
recovery
for
the
disability
or
death
through
workman's
compensation
proceedings
may
not
validly
be
provided
by
state
law.
now
it's
said
that
this
last
clause
was
written
out
of
the
statute
by
this
court's
decision
in
the
calbeck
case.
i'm
planning
to
devote
the
final
portion
of
my
available
time
to
a
discussion
of
the
calbeck
case,
but
i
will
say
now
that
i
don't
think
the
statement
i
have
just
recounted
is
true.
writing
provisions
out
of
the
statute
is
not
the
function
of
the
court.
and
i
don't
interpret
the
calbeck
decision
as
attempting
to
do
so.
on
the
contrary,
the
present
case
is
i
submit
an
excellent
example
of
a
situation
where
this
final
clause
is
applicable
and
is
dispositive
of
the
question
of
construction
and
of
the
litigation.
turning
specifically
to
the
question
of
construction,
i've
already
referred
to
the
language
of
the
statute
but
the
argument
is
confirmed
by
the
legislative
history.
the
statute
including
this
jurisdictional
language
was
of
course
passed
following
the
jensen
decision
and
the
two
cases
where
the
court
struck
down
the
first
two
attempts
of
congress
to
deal
with
the
problem.
not
only
was
the
jensen
case
there
was
clear
territorial
implications,
but
this
court
had
already
decided
the
nordenholt
case
in
259
u.s.
in
an
opinion
by
mr.
justice
mcreynolds
who
was
the
author
of
the
jensen
opinion.
and
the
court
held
that
an
injury
to
a
longshoreman
on
a
pier
was
covered
by
the
state
workers'
compensation
law.
this
is
no
--
this
was
no
mere
straining
to
find
some
way
to
provide
compensation.
the
court
in
its
opinion
referred
to
the
doctrine
that
locality
and
i'm
quoting
“locality
is
the
exclusive
test
of
admiralty
jurisdiction.”
it
said,
eisends
who
was
the
injured
workman,
was
injured
upon
the
dock,
an
extension
of
the
land,
“see
cleveland
terminal
and
valley
railroad
company
against
cleveland
steamship
company.”
this
was
the
setting
in
which
congress
legislated.
its
understanding
was
made
explicit
in
the
report
of
the
senate
committee
which
is
set
forth
on
page
13
of
the
government's
brief.
now
the
senate
report
said
that
injuries
occurring
in
loading
or
unloading
are
not
covered
unless
they
occur
on
the
ship
or
between
the
wharf
and
the
ship
so
as
to
bring
them
within
the
maritime
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states.
in
the
process
of
enacting
the
statute,
we
have
further
evidence.
for
there
was
at
one
time
in
the
bills
as
they
went
through
congress
a
general
provision
that
it
should
apply
to
any
employment
performed
on
a
place
within
the
admiralty
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states,
except
employment
of
local
concern,
and
of
no
direct
relation
to
navigation
or
commerce.
all
of
which
would
have
been
very
uncertain
in
scope
and
would
have
yielded
would've
meant
itself
to
a
construction
in
this
case
in
accordance
with
that
of
the
court
below.
but
congress
took
that
out
and
substituted
in
its
place
the
language
which
has
persisted
unchanged
for
more
than
40
years
upon
the
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states
including
any
dry
dock.
this
showed
a
clearly
territorial
approach
which
is
surely
understandable
in
the
light
of
the
decisions
as
they
stood
at
that
time.
next,
i
would
point
out
that
this
was
the
immediate
and
long
continued
consistent
administrative
construction
of
the
statute
which
should
be
given
great
weight
at
this
late
day.
almost
at
once,
and
in
a
long
series
of
rulings,
the
administrative
agency
charged
with
the
application
of
the
statute
construed
it
not
to
apply
to
pier
side
injuries
as
it
has
done
in
this
case.
and
finally,
since
the
statute
was
enacted,
this
court's
decisions
lead
to
the
same
conclusion
as
long
ago
as
1941.
this
court
said
in
parker
against
motor
boat
sales
and
i
quote,
“the
field
in
which
a
state
may
not
validly
provide
for
compensation
must
be
taken
for
the
purposes
of
the
act
as
the
same
field
which
the
jensen
line
of
decision
excluded
from
state
compensation
laws.”
without
affirming
or
rejecting
the
constitutional
implications
of
those
cases,
we
accept
them
as
the
measure
by
which
congress
intended
to
mark
the
scope
of
the
act
they
brought
into
existence.
and
shortly
thereafter
in
davis
against
the
department
of
labor,
the
court
said
that
“congress
as
by
the
longshoreman's
act
accepted
the
jensen
line
of
demarcation
between
state
and
federal
jurisdiction.”
and
more
specifically
in
swanson
against
marra
bros.
company,
to
which
mr.
coleman
has
referred,
the
court
held
almost
directly
that
a
pier
side
injury
was
covered
by
the
longshoreman's
act
citing
and
relying
on
the
nordenholt
case.
i
turn
now
to
the
calbeck
case,
which
is
of
course
an
important
authority
in
the
construction
of
the
longshoreman's
act.
my
submission
is
that
it
supports
our
construction
of
the
statute.
some
language
in
it
is
taken
out
of
context
to
sustain
the
contrary
argument.
but
that
argument
will
not
survive,
i
submit,
when
the
language
is
placed
in
the
context
of
the
decision
as
a
whole.
in
the
first
place,
we
must
give
consideration
to
the
actual
facts
of
the
calbeck
case.
the
language
of
an
opinion
of
course
takes
significance
as
applied
to
the
facts
which
were
before
the
court.
and
in
the
calbeck
case,
the
court
was
dealing
with
an
injury
to
an
employee
who
was
working
on
a
ship
which
was
afloat
on
navigable
waters.
this
is
the
clearest
possible
situation
within
the
admiralty
jurisdiction
and
within
the
jensen
case.
the
workmen
there
were
on
the
water
side
of
the
jensen
line
of
demarcation.
and
what
the
court
said
has
great
relevance
to
injuries
which
are
so
clearly
maritime
that
this
was
the
area
on
which
the
court
focused
is
clearly
shown
by
the
repeated
references
in
the
opinion
to
“injuries
incurred
on
navigable
waters.”
this
phrase
occurs
at
least
nine
times
in
the
opinion
with
slight
variations.
as
to
such
injuries,
the
court
did
use
some
rather
broad
language,
but
it
was
only
such
injuries
that
were
actually
before
the
court.
that
the
court
did
not
intend
to
go
further
is
shown
by
its
reference
to
the
ex-adoption
of,
and
here
again
i
quote
“the
jensen
line
between
admiralty
and
state
jurisdiction
as
the
limit
of
federal
coverage.”
and
its
reference
to
the
fact
that
in
davis
against
the
department
of
labor,
the
court
had
pointed
out
that,
and
again
i
quote
“the
act
adopts
the
jensen
line
of
demarcation.”
it
should
be
observed
too
that
the
in
the
calbeck
case,
the
court
at
page
129
cited
the
nordenholt
case
with
approval.
where
it
had
been
held
just
before
the
enactment
of
the
statute,
that
injuries
on
piers
were
on
the
state
authority
side
of
the
jensen
line
of
demarcation.
thus,
calbeck
when
closely
examined
deals
only
with
the
water
side
of
the
jensen
act
of
demarcation.
it
accepts
--
mr.
griswold
yes,
i
think
the
floating
dock
might
be
the
equivalent
of
a
vessel,
i
don't
know.
then
it
would
be
upon
navigable
waters.
i
can
only
say
that
we
don't
have
that
case
here.
mr.
griswold
certainly
a
barge
floating
beside
a
ship
which
is
being
used
in
unloading
a
ship
would
be
within
the
admiralty
jurisdiction.
and
i
don't
recall
a
case
which
has
involved
a
floating
pier.
but
i
think
that
it's
very
likely
that
that
would
be
held
to
be
within
the
admiralty
jurisdiction.
certainly,
it
was
not
the
situation
which
was
involved
in
the
nordenholt
case
which
was
a
fixed
structure
built
on
land.
calbeck
as
i
have
said
does
accept
the
nordenholt
case
and
makes
it
plain
that
a
pier
side
injury
such
as
that
involved
here
is
and
always
has
been
understood
to
be
covered
by
the
state
acts.
and
is
thus
outside
the
scope
of
the
longshoreman's
act
not
only
because
the
injury
is
on
the
state
side
of
the
jensen
line
of
demarcation,
but
also
because
coverage
of
the
longshoreman's
act
is
expressly
excluded
by
the
final
clause
of
section
3
(a)
since
a
remedy
under
the
state
act
is
clearly
available.
and
this
is
the
case
it
seems
to
me
where
that
final
clause
can
properly
be
applied.
in
the
calbeck
case,
the
court
did
quote
some
rather
expansive
language
from
judge
hutcheson
in
the
de
bardeleben
coal
case.
but
nevertheless,
the
case
itself
involves
injuries
which
were
clearly
on
the
water
side
of
the
jensen
line
of
demarcation.
congress
did
undertake
to
use
its
authority
to
the
full
as
it
then
understood
its
authority
to
be
under
this
court's
decisions.
in
undertaking
to
meet
its
responsibility,
it
drew
the
line
which
it
understood
to
be
the
jensen
line
of
demarcation
to
which
this
court
has
frequently
since
made
reference.
though
it
may
be
that
it
could
draw
the
line
some
place
else
if
it
were
enacting
the
statute
now,
and
i
think
it
could.
this
is
the
place
where
it
did
draw
the
line
when
it
enacted
this
statute
in
1927.
nothing
that
has
happened
since
is
an
appropriate
reason
for
a
court
to
draw
the
line
someplace
else
that
is
the
responsibility
and
the
prerogative
of
congress.
mr.
griswold
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
since
this
is
a
re-argument,
i
have
tried
to
think
of
ways
in
which
i
could
be
of
assistance
to
the
court
and
it
has
seemed
to
me
that
i
might
focus
primarily
on
the
two
aspects
of
the
case
which
has
been
so
well
covered
by
mr.
coleman.
the
first
is
to
emphasize
again
the
fact
that
this
case
involves
purely
a
question
of
statutory
construction.
it
is
not
a
question
of
constitutional
laws.
the
statute
is
set
forth
at
pages
two
to
four
of
the
government's
brief
and
the
immediately
relevant
language
is
that
in
section
three
of
the
act
about
three
inches
below
the
top
of
page
three.
compensation
shall
be
payable
under
this
chapter
in
respect
to
disability
or
death
of
an
employee
but
only
if
the
disability
or
death
results
from
an
injury
and
here
are
the
crucial
words,
occurring
upon
the
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states,
including
any
dry
dock,
and
if
recovery
for
the
disability
or
death
through
workman's
compensation
proceedings
may
not
be
validly
provided
by
state
law.
i
think
it
is
significant
that
that
language
does
not
say
within
the
maritime
or
admiralty
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
nor
does
it
say
as
far
as
congress
may
validly
make
federal
law
apply.
on
the
contrary,
the
way
the
statute
is
worded
shows
that
congress
was
trying
to
restrict
the
scope
of
federal
law
and
was
endeavoring
to
have
state
law
applied
whenever
it
could
but
it
knew
that
there
were
areas
where
state
law
could
not
apply
and
therefore
it
felt
compelled
to
enact
this
statute
to
provide
a
remedy
for
those
who
were
outside
and
the
scope
of
state
law.
not
for
those
who
were
inside
the
scope
of
federal
law
but
for
those
who
were
outside
the
scope
of
state
law.
now,
this
statute
was
passed
on
march
4,
1927
and
i
suggest
that
the
crucial
question
is
the
understanding
of
congress
in
1927
when
that
statute
was
written
and
not
what
the
constitutional
law
was
then,
not
what
the
constitutional
law
would
be
now
but
what
was
the
common
understanding
and
apprehension.
a
person's
familiar
with
this
problem
in
1927.
now,
that
of
course
goes
back
to
the
fact
that
state
workmen's
compensation
laws
were
enacted
beginning
about
1912.
no
federal
workman's
compensation
law.
in
the
jensen
case
which
came
to
this
court
in
1917
but
which
involved
an
injury
which
occurred
in
1913
or
1914,
the
facts
were
that
the
injury
occurred
to
a
man
who
was
operating
a
truck
on
a
gangway
between
a
pier
and
the
ship.
he
backed
into
the
ship,
his
head
was
hit
on
the
back
by
the
ship
as
he
was
moving
his
truck
in
and
he
was
killed.
the
accident
occurred
on
a
gangway
but
above
navigable
water
and
the
actual
impact
was
with
the
ship
itself.
and
then
the
case
of
southern
pacific
company
against
jensen,
decided
in
1917.
the
court
held
that
that
was
within
the
maritime
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
that
the
law
as
to
that
must
be
uniform
and
that
couldn't
be
if
the
state
law
is
applied
and
it
was
beyond
the
territorial
jurisdiction
of
the
legislative
power
of
the
states.
now
it
isn't
relevant,
it
seems
to
me
whether
that
was
right
or
sound
or
was
a
decision
which
the
court
would
now
follow.
that
was
the
decision
which
was
made
and
was
the
important
part
of
the
background
of
the
statute
which
congress
enacted
ten
years
later.
then
there
is
another
decision
which
came
before
the
statute,
state
industrial
commission
against
nordenholt
decided
in
1922.
that
was
also
a
proceeding
under
the
new
york
workman's
compensation
act.
for
the
death
of
a
longshoreman
who
was
injured
on
a
dock
while
engaged
in
unloading
cement
from
a
ship.
his
job
was
to
receive
the
bags
of
cement
and
pile
them
on
the
dock
in
tiers.
he
fell
from
the
pile
of
bags
to
the
floor
of
the
dock.
the
opinion
says
it
was
a
dock,
there's
nothing
to
indicate
whether
it
was
a
pier
or
a
wharf
and
i
don't
think
that
makes
any
difference
so
wharf
being
parallel
with
the
shore
and
a
pier
extending
into
the
water
away
from
the
shore.
and
the
court
held
in
an
opinion
by
mr.
justice
mcreynolds
that
the
state
compensation
law
could
apply
and
in
the
opinion,
justice
mcreynolds
referred
to
and
i
quote
“the
doctrine
that
locality
is
the
exclusive
test
of
admiralty
jurisdiction.”
hesona
who
was
the
workman
was
injured
upon
the
dock,
an
extension
of
the
land,
see
cleveland
terminal
and
valley
railroad
company
against
cleveland
steamship
company
in
208
u.s.
and
that
was
a
case
where
a
ship
had
hit
some
docks
or
piles
over
water
and
the
protecting
piling
of
the
bridge,
it
was
an
admiralty
case,
liable
against
the
ship.
it
was
held
that
it
was
not
within
the
admiralty
jurisdiction.
the
result
of
that
case
might
well
be
changed
by
the
extension
of
the
admiralty
act
but
it
is
important
and
that
it
was
the
basis
cited
as
a
basis
for
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
nordenholt
case
in
1922.
during
this
period,
congress
made
two
efforts
to
provide
compensation
for
longshoreman.
one
was
by
an
amendment
of
the
jurisdictional
provision
with
respect
to
jurisdiction
of
federal
courts
and
the
other
was
by
a
statute
which
in
effect
undertook
to
say
that
it
is
the
will
of
congress
that
state
compensation
act
should
apply
to
injuries
to
longshoreman
whether
on
land
or
in
water.
in
both
situations,
this
court
held
that
the
acts
of
congress
were
unconstitutional,
were
beyond
the
power
of
congress
because
of
the
requirement
the
court
found
that
the
admiralty
power
should
be
exercised
on
a
uniform
basis
throughout
the
united
states.
i
mentioned
that
because
it
shows
plainly
that
congress
had
had
its
fingers
burned
and
the
draftsman
of
the
statute
in
1927
were
not
reaching
out
but
were
careful
to
avoid
any
possible,
a
constitutional
pitfalls.
and
this
is,
made
apparent,
not
only
by
the
wording
of
the
statute
to
which
i
have
referred
but
also
by
the
committee
report
at
that
time
which
was
quoted
by
mr.
coleman,
senate
report
number
973
on
the
bill
which
became
the
longshoreman's
act
where
the
committee
referred
to
the
fact
that
injuries
incurring
in
loading
or
unloading
are
not
covered
unless
they
occur
on
the
ship
or
between
the
wharf
and
the
ship
and
what
could
be
a
clearer
reference
to
the
jensen
case
than
that.
so
as
to
bring
them
within
the
maritime
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states,
not
as
we
now
conceive
it,
not
as
it
might
have
been
conceived
then
but
is
it
had
been
defined
by
this
court
in
the
jensen
case
and
the
two
which
followed.
and
not
only
do
we
have
that
clear
statement
in
the
legislative
history
in
1927
but
we
also
have
the
contemporaneous
administrative
construction
which
is
cited
on
page
17
of
our
brief,
twice
in
1927
within
a
few
months
after
the
statute
was
passed,
again
in
1928
and
continuously
thereafter
right
down
to
these
two
cases.
the
administrative
construction
by
the
agency
chartered
with
administering
this
act
has
been
to
draw
the
line
between
ships,
gangways
to
ships
on
the
one
end
and
piers
on
the
other.
i
think
it's
also
not
irrelevant
to
point
out
a
decision
of
this
court
in
1928
which
is
just
a
year
after
the
longshoreman's
act
was
passed.
this
case
did
not
involve
the
longshoreman's
act
but
it
does
show
the
clearly
enough
the
state
of
thinking
at
that
time
which
is
the
state
of
thinking
which
determine
the
intension
of
congress
in
drafting
the
longshoreman's
act.
this
is
t.
smith
and
son
incorporated
against
taylor
in
276
u.s.
and
opinion
by
mr.
justice
butler.
there
the
deceased
was
a
longshoreman.
he
was
working
on
a
staging
and
it
rested
solely
upon
the
wharf
and
projected
a
few
feet
over
the
water
to
and
near
the
side
of
the
vessel.
he
was
engaged
in
unloading
the
vessel
when
a
sling
loaded
with
five
sacks
of
soda
weighing
200
pounds
each
was
being
lowered
over
the
side
by
means
of
a
winch
on
the
vessel.
the
sling
struck
the
deceased
and
knocked
him
off
the
stage
into
the
water
where
he
was
sometime
later
found
dead.
the
court
referred
to
the
fact
that
the
stage
and
wharf
on
which
deceased
was
working
are
to
be
deemed
an
extension
of
land
and
that's
quotation,
citing
the
cleveland
terminal
case.
and
said
again
on
page
182
the
blow
by
the
sling
was
what
gave
rise
to
the
cause
of
action.
it
was
given
and
took
effect
while
the
deceased
was
upon
the
land.
it
was
the
sole,
immediate
and
proximate
cause
of
his
death
and
the
court
concluded
that
the
state
law
should
apply.
after
that
we
have
some
interval
until
1941
and
several
cases
thereafter.
in
two
decisions
written
by
justice
black
in
1941
and
in
1942,
and
an
opinion
by
mr.
justice
reed
in
1953
and
most
recently
in
mr.
justice
brennan's
opinion
in
the
calbeck
case,
the
court
referred
in
these
words
to
the
jensen
line
of
demarcation
as
something
which
was
established,
known
and
accepted
and
it's
perfectly
plain
of
course
that
the
jensen
line
of
demarcation
is
the
line
between
the
water
and
the
land
and
specifically
as
applied
to
this
type
of
occasion
between
the
water
and
the
pier
because
there
are
numerous
cases
of
which
perhaps
the
nordenholt
case
is
the
most
significant
which
hold
that
the
pier
is
an
extension
of
the
land,
is
a
part
of
the
land
and
is
to
be
treated
as
the
land
for
that
purpose.
one
of
the
significant
cases
in
this
period
is
the
one
to
which
mr.
coleman
has
referred,
swanson
against
the
marra
brothers,
one
of
the
very
final
opinions
of
chief
justice
stone
in
328
u.s.
that
is
significant
here
i
think
because
it
was
a
longshoreman
working
on
a
pier
loading
cargo
and
he
was
injured
when
a
life
raft
fell
from
the
vessel
and
injured
him.
and
the
court
decided
there
that
the
longshoreman's
act
excludes
from
its
own
terms
and
from
the
jones
act
any
remedies
against
the
employer
for
injuries
inflicted
on
shore
and
it
went
on
to
refer
and
this
is
quoted
on
page
16
of
our
brief
that
to
land
torts
and
plainly
contemplated
that
this
injury
to
this
workman
who
is
a
longshoreman
working
on
a
pier
was
a
land
tort.
and
so
we
feel
that
the
setting
in
which
the
statute
was
drafted
makes
it
quite
plain
that
congress
was
seeking
to
find
and
to
lay
down
the
jensen
line
of
demarcation,
that
that
line
had
been
made
very
clear
by
the
decision
of
this
court
at
that
time
that
this
was
expressly
referred
to
and
adopted
by
the
congressional
committee
reports
at
the
time
that
current
administrative
practice
was
in
the
court
and
that
this
court
has
ever
since
in
numerous
cases
reiterated
the
fact
that
the
line
has
been
drawn
as
the
jensen
line
of
demarcation.
mr.
griswold
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
before
the
recess
i
tried
to
outline
some
of
the
background
describing,
defining
the
situation
within
which
congress
acted
when
it
legislated
in
1927.
i
referred
to
the
nordenholt
case
decided
by
this
court
in
1922
involving
a
pier
injury
and
i
would
like
simply
o
supplement
that
by
referring
also
to
the
court's
opinion
in
washington
against
dawson
and
company
in
1924
and
that
was
a
case
which
held
invalid
the
second
effort
of
congress
to
make
state
workman's
compensation
acts
applicable.
in
the
dawson
opinion,
the
court
said
on
page
227
industrial
commission
against
nordenholt
company
related
to
a
claim
based
upon
death
which
resulted
from
injuries
received
by
the
longshoreman
while
along
the
dock-a
matter
never
within
the
admiralty
jurisdiction.
now,
whether
that
is
right
or
not,
whether
that
is
what
this
court
would
now
hold
seems
to
me
not
significant,
that
is
what
this
court
declared
in
1924
and
that
was
the
most
recent
basis
upon
which
the
congress
could
act
when
it
drafted
the
statute
which
was
enacted
in
1927.
mr.
griswold
mr.
justice
mcreynolds.
nearly
all
of
the
opinions
in
this
area
in
that
period
were
of
mr.
justice
mcreynolds'.
now
in
concluding
my
portion
of
the
argument,
i
would
like
to
refer
as
mr.
coleman
did
to
the
rodrigue
case
decided
last
june.
that
case
had
a
of
course
somewhat
parallel
to
this
case.
it
was
argued
in
february.
this
case
was
argued
in
march.
on
may
19th,
the
court
set
this
case
down
for
re-argument.
on
june
7th,
it
decided
the
rodrigue
case.
and
i
had
a
relatively
leisurely
opportunity
over
the
summer
to
consider
the
rodrigue
opinion
and
its
application
to
this
case
and
i
must
confess
that
i
have
not
been
able
to
find
out
any
basis
upon
which
i
can
come
to
any
other
conclusion
than
that
the
rodrigue
opinion
in
effect
decides
this
case.
mr.
coleman
referred
to
some
of
the
passages,
i
have
marked
half
a
dozen
of
them.
on
page
355
the
court
said
since
the
seas
act
does
not
apply
of
its
own
force
under
admiralty
principles
and
since
the
lands
act
deliberately
as
to
the
application
of
admiralty
principles
to
these
noble
structures,
louisiana
is
not
ousted
by
the
seas
act.
and
on
page
359,
the
act
regresses
only
those
that's
stemming
from
wrongful
actions
or
omissions
occurring
on
the
high
seas
and
these
cases
involve
a
series
of
events
on
artificial
islands.
admiralty
jurisdiction
has
not
been
construed
to
extend
to
accidents
on
piers,
jetties,
bridges
or
even
ramps
or
railways
running
into
the
sea.
and
again
on
page
360,
it
was
an
island
albeit
an
artificial
one
and
the
accidents
had
no
more
connection
with
the
ordinary
stuff
of
admiralties
than
do
accidents
on
piers.
and
finally
on
page
361,
in
these
circumstances,
the
seas
act
which
provides
an
action
in
admiralty
clearly
would
not
apply
under
conventional
admiralty
principles
since
these
were
structured
and
careful
scrutiny
of
the
hearings
shows
that
it
was
the
view
that
maritime
law
was
inapposite
to
these
fixed
structures
and
there
is
finally
a
considerable
reliance
on
the
fact
that
the
employees
on
these
structures
are
land
based,
that
they
go
back
and
forth
to
their
homes
on
land
and
of
course
that
is
equally
applicable
to
the
longshoreman
and
who
are
involved
here.
i
will
have
only
one
final
point
to
make
which
is
with
respect
to
the
calbeck
case
which
is
a
rather
broad
and
sweeping
opinion
but
i
would
point
out
that
it
deals
entirely
with
the
water
side
of
the
jensen
line
of
demarcation.
it
says
that
on
the
water
side,
the
longshoreman
act
is
intended
to
be
provided
broadly
and
comprehensively.
there
is
nothing
in
the
decision
and
little
in
the
language
in
the
calbeck
opinion
which
has
any
reference
whatever
to
the
land
side.
this
case
involves
something
on
the
land
side.
it
may
be
arbitrary
to
draw
the
line
at
that
particular
point.
it
is
of
course
arbitrary
to
draw
that
any
point
the
line
might
well
had
been
sensible
to
have
said
that
longshoreman
are
governed
by
state
acts
but
then
we
would
have
had
seamen
who
were
governed
clearly
by
admiralty.
we
would
have
had
men
working
side
by
side
getting
different
benefits.
if
the
longshoreman's
act
was
extended
to
longshoreman
no
matter
where
they
were,
we
would
have
all
kinds
of
problems
about
how
far
inland
extended
and
we
would
again
have
people
working
side
by
side
getting
different
benefits.
it's
our
view
that
the
line
had
been
clearly
and
firmly
drawn,
whether
rightly
or
not
at
the
edge
of
the
water,
either
on
the
shore
or
on
a
pier
at
the
time
the
1927
act
was
passed
that
that
is
the
line
which
congress
adopted
that
this
court
has
repeatedly
referred
to
the
jensen
line
of
demarcation
and
that
should
be
controlling
here.
