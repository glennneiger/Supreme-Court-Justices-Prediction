mr.
john
j.
o'connor,
jr.
i
should
like
to
define
the
issues
involved
in
these
cases.
at
the
conclusion
of
my
introductory
portion,
i'll
be
very
happy
to
proceed
in
which
ever
direction
you
suggest.
one,
discuss
the
points
set
forth
in
my
brief
but
in
a
different
sequence.
two,
limit
my
discussion
basically
to
the
philosophy
of
five
cases
of
this
court
commencing
with
o'donnell
versus
great
lakes
and
terminating
with
the
reed
decision.
or
three,
devoting
the
time
i
have
allotted
to
responding
to
any
questions
you
may
care
to
direct
to
me.
first
of
all,
these
cases
involve
longshoreman
who
are
members
of
a
gang,
a
work
unit,
actively
engaged
in
discharging
cargo
from
a
vessel
alongside
of
a
pier.
their
duties,
their
rest
periods,
their
lunch
periods
require
them
to
go
back
and
forth
between
the
vessel
and
the
pier.
they're
doing
the
same
work.
they're
receiving
the
same
pay.
they
are
exposed
to
the
same
risks.
we're
not
dealing
in
this
case
with
anyone
running
to
an
office
downtown,
anyone
working
in
a
machine
shop,
anyone
driving
a
laundry
truck.
my
second
point
is
the
issue
in
these
cases
is
not
of
constitutional
magnitude.
jensen,
stewart,
dawson
these
cases
held
that
admiralty
was
exclusively
federal
and
that
states
could
not
be
permitted
to
invade
that
domain
with
or
without
attempted
congressional
sanction.
the
crucial
question
in
these
cases
is
this.
may
the
federal
government
legislate
in
a
field
where
the
states
may
also
have
exercised
some
dominion?
these
other
cases
we're
looking
in
the
opposite
direction.
they
were
--
the
issue
there
was
one
of
permissiveness
by
this
court
and
not
a
limitation
on
the
power
or
the
authority
of
the
federal
government.
the
third
point,
there
are
two
basic
sources
of
jurisdiction
for
congress,
one
the
admiralty
article,
two
the
commerce
article.
i'm
afraid
i
must
differ
with
the
distinguished
solicitor
general
when
he
appeared
before
you
a
few
moments
ago.
he
indicated
that
the
exclusive
source
of
admiralty
jurisdiction
was
locality.
locality
determines
jurisdiction
with
reference
to
torts.
but
admiralty
also
has
the
contract
aspect
and
there,
it's
the
nature
of
the
contract
and
not
the
locality.
in
addition
to
this,
we
have
the
commerce
power.
these
two
powers
are
totally
separate
distinct
independent.
they
may
be
exercised
jointly
or
independently.
in
the
longshoreman
act,
congress
was
aware
of
and
actually
did
exercise
both
of
these
powers.
the
next
point
i
find
myself
in
agreement
with
the
solicitor
general,
we
feel
that
these
cases
revolve
about
the
correct
liberal
interpretation
of
the
simple
term
“upon
the
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states.”
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
this
term
applied
equally
to
all
structures
on
navigable
waters
whether
the
structure
happened
to
be
a
pier
or
a
ship.
and
also
to
all
injuries,
whether
the
longshoreman
happened
to
be
aboard
the
ship
on
the
deck,
or
on
the
deck
of
a
pier.
the
final
comment
in
this
introductory
portion
i
should
like
to
make
is
this
your
honors.
under
the
maryland
law,
the
widow
and
the
family
would
receive
a
maximum
of
$15,000.00,
under
the
federal
statute
the
benefits
will
be
in
the
neighborhood
of
$63,000.00.
we
submit
that
a
hidden
issue
in
this
case
the
cause
to
the
insurance
company
and
ultimately
to
the
stevedoring
contractor.
and
as
this
court
has
repeatedly
held
that
is
not
a
valid
issue.
the
human
cost
of
doing
business
should
be
born
by
the
industry
and
not
by
the
victim
of
the
industry.
the
--
before
i
leave
that,
i
think
mr.
justice
fortas
directed
a
question
to
the
solicitor
general
and
inquired
“suppose
we
have
a
floating
dry
dock
belay
that
a
floating
pier,
what
would
be
the
ruling
in
such
a
situation?”
well
it
so
happens
that
there
has
been
such
a
case.
and
this
is
illustrative
of
the
conflict
and
the
confusion
which
is
existing
throughout
the
country
today.
a
recovery
for
the
longshoreman
was
awarded
by
the
compensation
commissioner.
as
i
recalled
it,
this
recovery
was
affirmed
by
the
district
court.
it
then
went
up
to
the
appellate
level
in
the
fifth
circuit.
the
same
circuit
that
has
provided
several
of
the
authorities
relied
upon
by
the
petitioners
in
this
case.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
in
a
decision
in
1967,
i'm
not
sure
whether
it's
travelers
versus
shea
in
382
f.2d.
or
nicholson
versus
calbeck
in
385
f.2d.
but
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
and
held
that
the
injury
was
not
compensable
under
the
act.
now,
my
first
point,
if
you
wish
me
to
follow
the
brief
basically.
alright,
but
suppose
i
take
the
first
point
that
i
may
deviate
to
another
system
mr.
chief
justice.
my
first
point
is,
in
addition
to
mean
factually
upon
navigable
waters,
piers
or
their
indispensable
edge-ons,
the
facts
of
these
cases
are
conceded.
we
might
say
that
there's
a
veritable
tidal
wave
of
navigable
waters
in
these
cases.
first,
we
have
the
solicitor
general's
brief.
he
says
the
relevant
facts
are
not
in
dispute.
then
we
have
the
admissions
on
the
pleadings
and
the
klosek
and
johnson
cases.
i'm
on
page
29
of
my
brief
at
this
point.
and
of
course
in
these
undisputed
verities
is
the
fact
the
piers
involved
on
our
controversy
are
“upon
navigable
waters.”
now
going
back
to
johnson
and
klosek,
in
our
complaint
for
review
which
was
filed
on
the
admiralty
side
in
the
district
of
maryland,
we
asserted
“the
complainant
was
working
as
a
longshoreman
on
the
600
foot
bethlehem
steel
high
pier
located
upon
navigable
waters”
that's
our
allegation.
paragraph
two
of
the
answer
of
the
petitioner
in
nacirema
in
this
particular
case
reads
as
follows.
“this
respondent
admits
the
matters
and
facts
alleged
in
the
second
article
of
the
complaint.”
turning
our
attention
briefly
to
the
avery
case,
there
is
an
expressed
stipulation
to
that
effect.
that
appears
at
page
9
of
the
appendix
that
the
pier
is
upon
navigable
waters.
over
and
above
that,
in
the
finding
of
fact
by
deputy
commissioner
traynor,
he
held
as
a
fact
“the
surface
of
the
pier
is
situated
over
the
navigable
waters.”
and
of
course
we
have
the
admissions
made
by
mr.
coleman
when
he
first
appeared
before
you.
he
stated
“there's
no
question
that
the
patapsco
river
is
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states.”
point
three
of
his
concession
was
that
the
pier
was
located
on
pilings
and
its
small
boats
could
navigate
under
them.
it
is
our
position
that
this
often
by
itself
is
dispositive
of
the
issue
involved
in
this
case.
now,
suppose
i
pass
on
to
an
analysis
of
the
principle
and
philosophy
in
the
--
what
i
consider
the
five
leading
cases.
my
brief,
i
believe,
contains
references
to
60
some
odd
cases.
i
think
these
are
the
most
important.
the
first
one
is
o'donnell
versus
great
lakes
dredge
and
dry
--
dock
company.
this
particular
decision
involved
a
suit
by
a
seaman
incidentally
where
back
in
--
that's
right
1943.
this
case
involved
a
suit
by
a
seaman
who
was
working
on
a
type
of
vessel
that
transported
sand.
this
sand
was
taken
ashore
by
some
sort
of
a
pipeline
system.
he
was
ashore
repairing
a
gasket
on
this
discharging
device.
he
filed
a
suit
under
the
jones
act
and
his
claim
was
denied
by
the
lower
court.
this
court
entertained
certiorari,
issued
the
writ
and
the
case
came
up
for
disposition.
now,
we
feel
that
it's
extremely
interesting
to
note
that
o'donnell
in
1943
interpreted
the
scope
of
the
jones
act
and
fundamentally
the
same
words
as
this
court
did
some
20
years
later
when
it
delineated
the
borders
of
the
longshoreman's
act
in
calbeck.
in
o'donnell
mr.
chief
justice
stone
in
resisting
an
attempt
to
restrict
the
coverage
of
this
beneficial
seaman's
act
stated,
i
quote
this
is
on
page
39
of
the
opinion.
“congress
in
the
absence
of
any
indication
of
a
different
purpose,
must
be
taken
to
have
intended
to
make
them”
--
them
is
the
words
of
the
jones
act
--
“make
them
so
far
as
the
words
and
the
constitution
permit
and
to
have
given
to
them
the
full
support
of
all
the
constitutional
power
it
possesses,
hence
the
act
allows
the
recovery
sought
unless
the
constitution
forbids
it.”
that
is
the
end
of
the
quotation.
the
jones
act
as
you
may
recall
was
passed
in
1920.
it
took
that
act
23
years
to
come
before
this
court
for
the
final
interpretation.
the
longshoreman
act
is
taken
a
bit
longer.
the
second
case
i
should
like
to
discuss
briefly
with
you
is
avondale
marine
ways
versus
henderson.
this
is
a
1953
decision
of
this
court
in
which
the
court
issued
a
per
curiam
decision
representing
the
views
of
eight
members
of
the
court.
there
was
no
dissent,
one
judge
did
not
participate.
o'donnell
i
believe
was
also
a
unanimous
decision.
in
avondale,
the
court
was
dealing
with
a
dry
dock
case.
the
longshoreman
act
covers
two
categories
of
workers.
it
covers
your
longshoreman
who's
working
on
the
pier
and
the
ship
and
also
covers
your
dry
dock
employees.
in
avondale,
the
situation
is
set
forth
in
a
footnote
in
the
lower
court's
opinion.
the
factual
backdrop
was
this,
this
is
footnote
2.
by
stipulation
or
by
the
uncontroverted
testimony,
it
was
established
that
at
the
time
of
the
explosion
on
the
barge,
the
barge
had
been
hauled
out
of
the
mississippi
river
on
the
cradle
of
a
marine
railway.
we're
dealing
with
a
marine
railway
not
technically
a
dry
dock.
and
that
both
cradle
and
barge
at
the
time
of
the
explosion
and
for
sometime
previously
thereto,
had
been
at
rest
ashore
at
a
point
400
feet
from
the
water.
to
the
predecessor
court,
it
was
so
obvious
that
the
longshoreman
act
should
be
liberally
construed
and
applied.
it
did
not
even
bother
with
writing
an
opinion.
it
had
a
one
sentence
per
curiam
affirming
an
award
in
favor
of
the
man
who
was
injured
on
this
barge
400
feet
inland
of
navigable
waters.
not
on
a
dry
dock
but
on
a
marine
railway.
our
analogy
there
is
that
if
the
dry
dock
portion
of
coverage
is
to
be
applied
with
sufficient
liberality
as
to
embrace
someone
400
feet
inland,
certainly
a
man
injured
on
a
pier
just
a
few
feet
from
the
edge
of
the
ship
and
still
at
that
time
physically
upon
navigable
waters
should
also
be
held
to
be
encompassed
within
the
protection
intended
by
congress
when
this
act
was
passed
back
in
1937.
the
third
case
of
course
is
our
incomparable
calbeck.
that
has
been
pretty
well
commented
upon
already.
i
don't
know
whether
any
further
elaboration
is
required
at
this
time.
i
don't
want
to
belabor
it.
the
courts
have
not
concurred
in
the
views
expressed
by
mr.
coleman
when
he
tries
to
place
a
very
limited
application
on
this
case.
now
as
we
all
know,
a
case
has
basically
two
components.
first
it
has
the
precise
determination
of
the
issue
based
on
the
particular
facts.
secondly,
from
that
precise
determination
it
transcends
into
establishing
or
following
a
principle.
now
the
principle
of
law,
we
all
know
the
facts
of
calbeck.
simply
that
although
in
the
past
state
camp
was
held
applicable
to
a
launched
but
uncompleted
ship.
the
lower
court
i
think
said
it's
about
57%
complete.
although
the
past
law
stated
that
the
state
could
award
compensation.
calbeck
held
that
nevertheless
the
compensation,
the
longshoreman's
compensation
act
also
applied
to
that
situation.
and
the
mere
fact
that
there
may
have
been
recognized
or
permitted
stated
jurisdiction
did
not
oust
the
federal
government
either
congress
or
the
courts
of
its
or
their
control
and
jurisdiction
over
admiralty
matters
and
navigable
water.
we
feel
we
have
the
same
precise
situation
here.
in
calbeck,
there's
no
question
that
the
statutes
of
louisiana
could
apply
too
and
be
availed
out
by
that
workman.
similarly
here,
there's
no
question
that
the
statutes,
the
workman's
compensation
of
maryland
could
apply
to
mr.
johnson
and
also
to
the
widow
of
mrs.
klosek.
but
we
submit
that
is
totally
insignificant.
this
case
is
not
one
of
constitutional
scope.
we're
not
determining
how
far
can
the
states
go.
we're
merely
deciding
if
the
state
was
permitted
in
the
past
to
exercise
some
jurisdiction
in
this
field.
does
that
mean
if
we
have
been
ousted
of
our
tradition
authority,
which
of
course
is
all
way
back
of
1789?
the
next
--
mr.
john
j.
o'connor,
jr.
what
is
that
mr.
justice
fortas?
mr.
john
j.
o'connor,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
j.
o'connor,
jr.
well
calbeck
very
effectively
disposed
of
that
sir.
i'll
see
if
i
can
get
the
precise
quotation
from
that
decision.
yes
sir,
on
page
117
of
370
u.s.,
this
court
asserted.
let's
see,
that
was
a
6
to
2
decision.
“our
conclusion
is
that
congress
invoked
its
constitutional
power
so
as
to
provide
compensation
for
all
injuries
sustained
by
employees
on
navigable
waters
whether
or
not
a
particular
injury
might
also
have
been
within
the
constitutional
reach
of
a
state
workman's
compensation
law.”
mr.
john
j.
o'connor,
jr.
yes,
sir.
that
was
one
of
the
main
points
that
was
emphasized
and
stressed
in
the
calbeck
case,
in
the
briefs
and
also
in
the
opinion
of,
i
forgot
who
authored
the
opinion
in
the
fifth
circuit.
is
there
any
further
elaboration
you
would
like
sir?
mr.
john
j.
o'connor,
jr.
thank
you
mr.
justice
fortas.
the
next
case
i
should
like
to
discuss
briefly
with
your
honors
is
gutierrez
versus
waterman
steamship
corporation
decided
in
1963,
and
authored
by
mr.
justice
white.
that
was
a
decision
by
this
court
that
divided
the
8
to
1.
this
is
frequently
been
referred
to
as
the
“beans
on
the
dock
case”
in
puerto
rico.
a
longshoreman
filed
a
suit
and
recovered
in
his
action.
this
was
appealed
to
the
first
circuit
and
the
lower
court's
decision
was
reversed.
the
recovery
was
taken
away
from
him.
then
it
came
up
before
this
court
on
writ.
i'd
like
to
read
these
excerpts
from
the
opinion.
this
is
209
of
373
u.s.
“respondent
contends
that
it
is
not
liable
at
least
in
admiralty
because
the
impact
of
its
alleged
lack
of
care
or
unseaworthiness
was
felt
on
the
pier
rather
than
aboard
ship.
whatever
validity
this
proposition
may
have
had
until
1948,
the
passage
of
the
extension
of
admiralty
jurisdiction
act
swept
it
away
when
it
made
vessels
on
navigable
water
“liable
for
‘damages
or
injury'
not
withstanding
that
such
damage
or
injury
may
be
done
or
consummated
on
land.”
on
page
210
we
find
this
excerpt
and
i
read
it
principally
because
of
the
situations
conjured
up
in
the
brief
submitted
by
an
amicus
on
behalf
of
petitioners.
“various
farfetched
hypotheticals
are
raised
such
as
a
suit
in
admiralty
for
an
ordinary
automobile
accident
involving
a
ship's
officer
on
ship's
business
and
port,
or
for
someone
slipping
on
beans
that
continue
to
leak
from
these
bags
in
a
warehouse
in
denver.
we
think
it's
sufficient
for
the
needs
of
this
occasion
to
hold

this
quotation
your
honor?
from
gutierrez,
the
gutierrez
decision.
the
final
excerpt
is
this
brief
paragraphed
on
page
215
of
the
same
decision.
“we
agree
with
this
reading
of
the
case
law
and
hold
that
the
duty
to
provide
a
seaworthy
ship
and
gear,
including
cargo
containers
applies
to
longshoremen
unloading
the
ship
whether
they
are
standing
aboard
ship
or
on
the
pier.”
we
think
we
have
a
very
analogous
situation
here.
we
feel
that
the
longshoreman
act
applies
whether
the
man
is
on
the
deck
of
the
ship
or
on
the
deck
of
the
pier.
and
the
basis
of
that
is
that
the
foundation
of
the
longshoreman
act
is
the
admiralty
power
of
the
united
states.
it
is
the
same
power
which
gave
rise
to
the
enactment
of
the
jones
act,
which
again
was
an
employer-employee
relationship.
the
admiralty
article
of
the
constitution
also
confers
admiralty
jurisdiction
on
this
court.
this
court
in
exercise
of
that
jurisdiction
and
in
recognition
of
its
humanitarian
objective
to
protect
maritime
workers
has
been
constantly
extending
the
seaworthiness
or
the
unseaworthiness
doctrine.
we
feel
that
it's
almost
incomprehensible
to
hold
that
this
open-end
unseaworthiness
protection
is
available
to
a
longshoreman
if
he's
injured
on
the
pier,
and
yet
the
protection
expressly
designed
for
him
by
the
longshoreman
act
has
denied
him
when
he
is
injured
on
that
same
pier.
the
final
case
is
reed
versus
s.s.
yaka.
that
was
decided
the
same
term
of
the
court
1963.
this
particular
opinion
was
authored
by
mr.
justice
black.
it
represented
the
views
of
seven
members
of
the
court.
in
that
case,
we
were
dealing
with
a
situation
where
the
injured
person
filed
suit
against
the
bareboat
charterer
who
was
also
his
employer.
there
was
a
provision
in
the
act
which
exonerated
the
employer
from
a
damage
suit.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
since
a
suit
could
not
be
instituted
in
personam,
therefore
a
suit
could
not
be
instituted
in
rem.
this
of
course
was
an
in
rem
proceeding,
so
the
lower
court
held
that
he
had
no
cause
of
action.
this
court
took
the
case
and
of
course
held
otherwise.
i'm
reading
now
from
page
415
of
373
u.s.
we
have
previously
said
that
the
longshoreman's
act
“must
be
liberally
construed
in
conformance
with
its
purpose
and
in
a
way
which
avoids
harsh
and
incongruous
results.”
we
think
it
would
produce
a
harsh
and
incongruous
result
one
out
of
keeping
with
a
dominant
intent
of
congress
to
help
longshoreman
to
distinguish
between
liability
to
longshoremen
injured
under
precisely
the
same
circumstances,
because
some
draw
their
pay
directly
from
a
shipowner,
and
others
from
a
stevedoring
company
doing
the
ships
service.
the
analogy
here
i
think
was
sort
of
anticipated
by
mr.
justice
fortas
when
he
said,
“suppose
this
sling
of
cargo
struck
two
men
working
on
the
pier,
just
knocking
one
down
or
over
to
the
edge
of
the
pier
and
flushing
the
other
one
off
into
the
water.
the
one
that
went
into
the
water
would
be
covered.
the
one
who
had
the
misfortune
to
just
be
knocked
sideways
a
little
distance
would
not
be
covered
under
our
--
under
the
theory
that
is
argued
for
by
the
petitioners
in
this
particular
case.”
and
we
say
this
would
be
harsh
and
incongruous
result,
because
their
dawned
the
same
precise
type
of
work.
mr.
john
j.
o'connor,
jr.
i
really
can't
directly
answer
that
sir.
i
tried
to
find
out
mr.
justice
white
just
at
what
point
a
pier
being
an
extension
of
land
came
into
the
law
books.
and
i
couldn't
locate
it.
now
it
makes
--
mr.
john
j.
o'connor,
jr.
i
wish
i
could
answer
that
sir
but
i
can't.
perhaps
the
solicitor
general
when
he
comes
back
before
you
may
be
able
to
fill
that
void.
mr.
john
j.
o'connor,
jr.
yes
sir,
i
am.
mr.
john
j.
o'connor,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
j.
o'connor,
jr.
well,
possibly
the
--
back
in
1865
or
thereabout
that
was
a
situation
where
for
some
sparks
from
the
funnel
set
fire
on
the
shore.
mr.
john
j.
o'connor,
jr.
the
jensen
line
your
honor,
as
i
understand
it,
is
solely
a
decision
that
the
states
cannot
legislate
in
the
admiralty
field.
for
the
simple
reason
that
must
be
uniform
--
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
john
j.
o'connor,
jr.
jensen
itself,
your
honor
--
jensen
was
a
longshoreman
who
operated
an
electric
truck
who
went
back
and
forth
from
the
pier
to
the
ship.
he
was
killed
when
he
was
taking
cargo
out
off
the
ship's
hold
on
to
the
gangway.
it
somehow
it
became
filed
up,
he
went
back
and
he
hit
his
head
on
the
ship
and
sustained
a
broken
neck.
so
jensen
sustained
his
injury
as
a
result
of
striking
the
ship.
it
was
held
that
his
injury
was
within
the
federal
domain
and
that
the
new
york
state
compensation
act
could
not
be
applied.
that's
the
factual
backdrop
of
the
jensen
decision.
following
that
we
have
dawson
and
knickerbocker-ice
case,
and
the
--
belay
that.
following
that,
congress
tried
to
pass
two
different
laws,
but
neither
one
passed
judicial
scrutiny
by
this
court
because
both
laws
tried
to
confer
on
the
state
authority
to
act
in
this
field.
and
this
court
stated
that
that
would
interfere
with,
disrupt
and
perhaps
destroy
the
uniformity
that
we
must
have
in
the
admiralty
field.
mr.
john
j.
o'connor,
jr.
that
escapes
me,
your
honor,
because
this
court
has
never
held
that
congress
did
not
have
the
authority
to
legislate
in
this
particular
field.
i
think
one
of
your
questions
directed
to
mr.
coleman
and
--
mr.
john
j.
o'connor,
jr.
well
i
don't
think
it's
--
mr.
john
j.
o'connor,
jr.
there
are
--
yes
sir.
there
are
dictas
in
the
various
decisions
which
expressly
refer
to
the
jensen
line
of
demarcation.
that
is
absolutely
correct.
mr.
john
j.
o'connor,
jr.
i
don't
know.
jensen
actually
was
injured
as
a
result
of
a
ship
--
might
i
say
ship
born
injury
because
he
struck
the
side
of
the
ship.
and
also,
it's
been
universally
held
that
a
--
except
that
i
shouldn't
say
held,
because
i
don't
think
it's
been
expressly
before
this
court
in
dicta
has
appeared
in
different
cases.
it
has
been
sort
of
universally
accepted
that
on
board
ship
or
on
board
the
gangway
federal
on
the
pier
state.
i
believe
at
one
time
with
reference
to
pier
injuries,
they
even
held
that
depends
on
what
direction
what
you're
going.
if
you're
going
from
the
pier
to
the
ship,
it's
land.
if
you're
coming
from
the
ship
to
the
pier,
you're
still
on
a
ship
until
you
reach
the
pier.
but
i
think
these
hairsplitting
distinctions
have
all
been
done
away
with.
and
again
your
honor,
i
think
we're
dealing
in
this
particular
case
or
these
cases
with
a
liberal
interpretation
of
a
liberal
statute,
workman's
compensation
law.
so
these
distinctions
which
might
have
to
be
measured
by
maybe
johansen
blocks
the
real
delicate
calipers
shouldn't
take
up
the
time
of
the
court,
where
i
think
we
should
be
dealing
what
is
fair
and
equitable
and
what
did
congress
intend
by
passing
this
act
to
aid
and
assist
these
men
that
were
exposed
to
these
numerous
damages
and
injuries
because
of
the
hazards
of
their
occupation.
the
final
excerpt
from
reed
versus
yaka
is
the
following.
“as
we
said
in
a
slightly
different
factual
context
all
were
subjected
to
the
same
danger,
all
were
entitled
to
light
treatment
under
law.”
in
the
conclusion
portion
of
my
brief
commencing
on
page
34,
i
set
forth
various
anomalies
and
bizarre
situations
which
the
petitioners
are
requesting
this
court
to
ratify
and
support.
if
i
may
touch
briefly
upon
the
legislative
history
of
the
act,
if
one
thing
stands
out
pre-eminently,
it's
the
congressional
resolve
to
avoid
the
constitutional
pitfall
of
lack
of
uniformity
which
caused
congress
to
stumble
in
its
two
earlier
attempts
to
help
longshoremen.
the
preoccupation
of
the
chairman
with
uniformity
and
his
apprehensiveness
over
its
possible
vitiating
absence,
seamen
were
left
out
of
the
act.
the
only
omission
to
seamen,
everything
else
there
is
to
extend
and
enlarge
it
that's
why
they
put
in
“including
any
dry
dock”,
because
in
normal
common
sense
factual
appraisal,
a
dry
dock
is
not
upon
navigable
waters.
so
that
was
a
term
of
inclusion.
the
chairman
was
concerned
because
seamen
were
omitted.
and
this
preoccupation
is
apparent
throughout
all
the
proceedings,
the
senate
hearings
and
also
the
hearings
before
the
house
of
representatives.
now
with
represent
--
with
reference
to
the
uniformity
of
full
coverage,
there
was
just
about
unanimous
accord.
the
committees
in
both
houses
wanted
to
avoid
the
constitutional
flaw
in
the
law.
labor
both
the
ila
and
the
shipyard
unions
wanted
full
coverage.
management
supported
it,
in
fact
mr.
keating
was
very
critical
who
represented
the
shipowners
and
a
very
noted
admiralty
proctor
at
that
time.
he
was
critical
of
the
act
because
he
was
afraid
that
wasn't
embracive
enough,
it
didn't
include
everyone.
and
that
was
one
of
the
reasons
why
they
changed
the
terminology
from
a
place
upon
--
place
in
admiralty
jurisdiction
and
provided
that
it's
not
a
question
of
local
concern
and
whatnot.
the
government
agency
entrusted
with
the
administration
of
the
act
when
it
all
facets
of
the
job
covered.
and
to
argue
that
the
congress
of
the
united
states
deliberately
excluded
25%
of
the
longshoreman
workforce,
statistically
25
were
on
the
pier
and
75
are
aboard
ship.
to
argue
that,
that
they're
not
protected
by
the
act
is
driving
to
defeat
the
very
uniformity
that
congress
not
only
strove
for
but
actually
achieved.
my
final
comment
will
be
this
your
honors.
it
may
come
as
a
shock
to
petitioners
who
are
so
patently
outnumbered
of
some
pre-1927
views,
but
one
can
not
thrust
the
mighty
42-year
oak
of
the
act
back
into
its
embryonic
acorn.
both
the
seaworthiness
doctrine
and
the
act,
and
we
may
also
interpolate
here
the
jones
act
as
well,
are
traceable
to
a
common
origin
solicitude
for
maritime
workers
who
spend
their
lives
in
such
a
hazardous
occupation.
as
the
seaworthiness
doctrine
has
grown,
as
the
application
of
the
jones
act
has
been
extended,
these
have
expanded
these
have
developed
down
through
the
years,
so
to
it
is
respectfully
submitted
must
the
longshoreman
act.
thank
you.
mr.
john
j.
o'connor,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
as
we
understand
the
issue
in
these
cases
that
is
this,
does
the
longshoreman's
act
cover
injuries
occurring
“upon
the
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states.”
whether
on
the
deck
of
a
pier
as
well
as
on
the
deck
of
a
ship
when
the
precipitating
instrumentality
is
a
ship
a
word
crane.
by
a
solid
five
to
two
embank
decision,
the
court
of
appeals
for
our
fourth
circuit
held
that
such
a
pier
side
injury
was
compensable
under
the
act.
the
four
bases
of
the
holding
are
set
forth
on
pages
2
and
3
of
our
original
brief.
former
chief
judge
sobeloff
altered
a
masterful
opinion
which
carefully
considered
and
rejected
the
various
arguments
advanced
before
this
court
today.
these
cases
involved
longshoreman
members
of
a
six
team
man
gang,
a
definite
work
unit
actively
engaged
in
loading
ocean
going
freighters.
their
duties,
there
are
rest
periods,
there
are
lunch
periods,
all
require
them
to
go
back
and
forth
between
the
vessel
and
the
pier.
they
were
doing
the
same
work,
they
were
receiving
the
same
pay.
they
were
exposed
to
the
same
risks.
they
were
employed
by
the
same
corporation.
the
thrust
of
our
argument
is
that
they
were
entitled
to
the
same
workman's
compensation.
in
the
last
analysis,
as
the
solicitor
general
indicated,
we
can
reduce
these
cases
to
their
simplest
component.
they
revolve
about
the
correct
liberal
interpretation
of
the
phrase
“upon
the
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states.”
in
the
opinion
authored
by
judge
sobeloff,
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
this
term
applied
equally
to
all
structures
on
navigable
waters,
whether
the
structure
happen
to
be
a
ship
or
whether
the
structure
happen
to
be
a
pier.
a
ship
actually
displaces
more
water
than
does
a
pier
and
someone
on
a
pier
is
considerably
closer
to
the
level
of
navigable
waters
than
someone
on
a
deck
of
a
ship
which
may
be
15
to
50
feet
above
the
surface
of
the
navigable
waters.
now,
we
hear
and
frequently
this
particular
phrase
as
banded
about,
a
pier
is
an
extension
of
the
land.
we
submit
that
that
is
inaccurate
factually
as
it
is
historically.
logically
and
functionally,
a
pier
is
an
extension
of
the
ship.
it
is
really
nothing
more
than
an
oversized
gangway.
a
pier
cannot
be
conceived
of
except
in
connection
with
navigable
waters
and
a
ship.
servicing
a
vessel,
facilitating
its
loading
or
discharging
is
its
reson
d'etre.
in
the
words
of
johnson
company
versus
garrison,
a
1914
decision
of
this
court,
“the
mooring
of
a
vessel
is
as
necessary
as
its
movement.”
and
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
california
came
to
their
common
sense
conclusion
that
a
pier
is
an
extension
of
a
ship.
in
the
immigration
case
of

a
1952
decision
reported
in
105

at

517,
going
into
the
history
of
the
situation,
in
the
waiting
decades
of
the
17th
century,

“wrongs

at

and

when
the
courts
restrictively
applied
his
instructions,
the
king
issued
a
clarifying
directive
in
1694
known
as
the
royal
declaration.
he
reiterated
the
comprehensive
scope
of
admiralty.
benedict
on
admiralty
in
a
pre-1865
edition,
i
found
this
in
my
notes
but
i
have
not
been
able
to
confirm
it
but
i'm
sure
it
is
accurate,
in
section
107,
advisers
that
at
the
time
of
the
commonwealth,
admiralty
jurisdiction
included
“all
cases
of
prejudice
to
the
banks
of
navigable
rivers.”
or
to
“docks,
wharfs
and
keys.”
and
the
language
of
commissions
issued
to
admiralty
judges
read
in
part
“all
injuries
done
upon
the
public
rivers
and
upon
the
shores
and
banks
adjoining
them.”
and
as
we
all
know
the
lien
of
a
war
finger
is
recognized
and
enforced
in
admiralty.
and
they
come
down
to
a
more
recent
decision
out
of
this
court,
united
states
versus
louisiana,
1967,
the
denial
of
that
fictional
theory,
a
pier
is
an
extension
of
the
land
is
implicit
in
this
decision
which
held
that
the
natural
shoreline
of
1845
was
the
correct
line
of
demarcation
for
measuring
the
three
marine
lakes.
the
case
decided
that
a
jetty
was
not
an
extension
of
land
to
push
the
boundary
beyond
a
normal
three
marine
lake
figure.
a
pier
similarly
does
not
extend
the
jurisdiction
of
a
state.
it
still
is
measured
from
a
natural
shoreline
with
a
high
watermark.
we're
somewhat
baffled
at
the
position
of
the
solicitor
general
in
these
cases
because
we
had
occasion
to
read
the
splendid
brief
that
he
filed
in
the
calbeck
case.
on
page
51
he
had
this
to
say,
“where
injured
employee
sought
recovery
under
the
state
act,
the
presumption
of
constitutionality
would
sustain
and
award.
similarly,
the
statutory
presumption
in
the
longshoreman's
act
could
sustain
and
award
in
the
very
same
circumstances.
the
two
presumptions
in
effect
gave
the
employee
injured
in
the
twilight
zone
an
election
to
proceed
under
federal
or
state
law.”
let's
turn
our
attention
to
the
philosophy
of
workman's
compensation
law.
workman's
compensation
is
a
recognition
for
the
protection
and
compensation
of
persons
who
are
injured
in
work
connected
activities.
since
the
act
is
remedial
legislation,
it
is
to
be
applied
with
the
broadest
liberality
to
achieve
its
humanitarian
purposes.
the
court
of
appeals
has
directed
the
entry
of
an
award
in
these
cases.
as
judge
palmerri
admonished
in
the
michigan
mutual
case,
a
federal
compensation
should
be
upheld
“if
there
is
any
reasonable
argument
for
coverage
under
the
act.”
there
is
considerably
more
than
a
reasonable
argument
for
coverage
under
the
act
in
these
cases.
as
this
court
has
admonished,
we
are
to
avoid
“harsh
and
in
congress
results.”
and
as
a
decision
in
the
fourth
circuit
urged,
the
acts
beneficent
purposes
are
not
to
be
“frustrated
by
needless
refinements.”
the
philosophy
of
workman's
compensation
statutes
is
protected.
liability
arises
as
an
incident
of
the
employment
relationship.
it
is
related
to
the
contract
of
employment.
it
is
not
predicated
on
fault
as
in
tort
actions.
let's
turn
our
attention
to
the
actual
wording
of
the
statute.
the
key
expression
in
these
cases
is
“if
a
disability
or
death
results
from
an
injury
occurring
upon
the
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states
(including
any
dry
dock).”
the
touch
tone
of
coverage
is
this
generic
phrase,
upon
the
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states.
now,
congress
could
very
easily
have
restricted
the
application
of
this
law
by
a
simple
provision
such
as
“occurring
upon
a
ship
(including
the
gangway)”
but
congress
did
not.
it
used
the
very
generic,
broad
terminology
because
it
wanted
everyone
under
the
umbrella
of
its
protection.
mr.
john
j.
o'connor,
jr.
ah
--
yes,
sir.
obviously
it
could
but
as
was
pointed
out,
a
pier
is
clearly
upon
navigable
waters.
a
dry
dock
is
not
so
clearly
upon
navigable
waters.
i
understand
they
gauged
out
an
area
and
they
permit
the
waters
to
flow
into
that
part
that
was
formally
dry
land.
but
your
pier
is
in
a
different
category,
it
does
not
replace
the
navigable
waters,
the
navigable
waters
flow
freely
underneath
the
deck
of
the
pier.
mr.
john
j.
o'connor,
jr.
i
think
a
bridge
is
on
a
different
--
mr.
john
j.
o'connor,
jr.
ah
--
i
think
that's
a
little
bit
different
situation
your
honor
because
a
bridge
connects
two
segments
of
land.
so,
a
bridge
is
more
closely
alive
with
a
brand
operation.
mr.
john
j.
o'connor,
jr.
i
suppose
technically
your
honor,
upon
navigable
waters
you
could
say
that
someone
on
a
bridge
is
upon
navigable
waters
just
as
someone
on
a
pier.
just
as
the
courts
have
held
someone
locked
in
an
airplane
in
dollarman
case
is
upon
the
high
seas
although
he
is
several
thousand
feet
up
in
the
air.
now,
let's
look
at
some
illustrative
situations.
according
to
the
petitioner's
concept
of
the
law,
they
can
see
that
if
the
same
load
involved
in
these
proceedings,
a,
struck
and
crushed
a
longshoreman
in
the
hold,
the
injury
would
be
covered
by
the
act.
b,
struck
and
crushed
the
longshoreman
on
deck,
the
injury
would
be
covered.
c,
struck
and
crushed
the
longshoreman
on
the
gangway,
the
injury
would
be
covered.
d,
knocked
the
longshoreman
from
the
ship
onto
the
pier,
the
injury
would
be
covered.
e,
knocked
the
longshoreman
on
the
pier
into
the
water,
again
coverage.
f,
struck
and
crushed
the
longshoreman
in
a
boat
under
the
pier,
he
would
be
covered.
g,
lifted
the
longshoreman
up
and
dropped
him
back
to
the
pier,
the
injury
would
be
covered.
h,
as
we
all
know
if
we
had
a
third
party
action,
he
could
recover
under
the
seaworthiness
doctrine,
under
(inaudible)
and
the
extension
of
admiralty.
now
under
these
factual
situations,
they
admit
coverage
under
the
act.
but
if
the
longshoreman
is
struck
on
the
pier
and
merely
not
horizontally
but
remains
on
the
pier,
his
injury
are
dealt,
according
to
them
is
not
covered.
obviously
congress
never
intended
such
a
bizarre
result.
at
the
earlier
arguments,
some
members
of
the
court
asked
about
situations
of
this
type.
we're
sure
that
congress
be
an
equally
and
practically
minded
thought
of
similar
situations
and
they
devised
an
act
intended
to
bring
all
of
these
men,
these
longshoremen
within
their
protective
coverage
of
the
statute.
mr.
john
j.
o'connor,
jr.
well,
i
would
say
--
i
think
your
honor
if
you
are
injured
on
the
pier,
i
think
it's
compensable
but
that
brings
us
to
the
next
point,
our
case
has
an
additional
maritime
or
admiralty
nexus
because
the
upending
instrumentality
was
not
on
the
shore
but
on
the
vessel
itself.
mr.
john
j.
o'connor,
jr.
i
say
as
far
as
the
liberal
purpose
of
the
longshoreman's
act
is
concerned,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
it
makes
any
difference.
mr.
john
j.
o'connor,
jr.
no,
sir.
because
here,
you
have
the
additional
connection
with
the
admiralty
activity.
you
have
a
ship
ward
claim.
mr.
john
j.
o'connor,
jr.
on
the
--
no,
sir.
if
a
man
is
on
the
building
on
the
shore,
i
do
not
say
he's
covered.
i
say
he's
on
the
pier.
mr.
john
j.
o'connor,
jr.
yes,
sir.
i
say
he's
covered.
mr.
john
j.
o'connor,
jr.
well,
if
he's
upon
navigable
waters,
yes
sir
because
that's
a
touchstone
of
jurisdiction
and
your
honor
we
have
--
with
reference
to
the
basis
of
this
law,
we
have
the
tort
jurisdiction
of
admiralty
and
we
have
the
contract
jurisdiction
of
admiralty.
the
contract
of
course,
pertains
to
the
nature
of
the
activity.
but
over
and
above
the
admiralty
basis,
we
have
the
commerce
clause
and
at
the
very
first
hearing
conducted
into
the
act,
reference
was
made
to
the
applicability
of
the
commerce
clause
and
we
don't
even
theoretically
need
admiralty
of
waters
because
your
commerce
gives
the
congress
authority
over
the
activity
because
of
this
interstate
nature.
we
feel
that
the
fallacy
of
the
position
may
be
brought
out
a
bit
more
clearly
if
we
use
this
illustration.
if
a
group
of
men
were
employed
to
work
in
a
warehouse
and
during
the
course
of
the
employment,
a
load
broke
free
and
injured
someone
in
the
warehouse,
the
same
load
also
injured
someone
on
the
steps
of
the
warehouse
and
the
same
load
rolled
down
and
injured
someone
on
the
sidewall.
all
three
members
or
members
of
the
gang,
members
of
this
work
detail
and
employed
by
this
warehouse.
the
employer
and
the
insurer
came
into
court
and
suggested
that
the
man
working
on
the
sidewalk
was
not
entitled
to
the
same
protection
and
the
same
law
as
his
co-employees
working
in
the
building
and
on
the
steps
over
the
gangway.
i'm
sure
this
court
would
lose
no
time
in
stating
that
that
is
offensive
to
the
due
process
provision.
and
the
court
is
held
that
this
is
a
limitation
not
only
in
state
laws
but
it
should
also
be
applied
to
federal
statutes
to
prevent
unfair
discrimination.
perhaps,
i
should
now
respond
to
some
of
the
remarks
made
by
the
other
side
during
the
presentation
of
their
case.
the
initial
concession
made
by
mr.
coleman
was
that
the
piers
did
extend
out
over
the
navigable
waters.
we
feel
this
is
disposative
of
the
case.
and
he
also
admitted
that
the
men
passed
freely
back
and
forth
between
the
ship
and
the
pier.
we
cannot
conceive
that
congress
intended
to
have
a
part
time
statute
that
applies
as
a
pendulum.
as
you
go
aboard
ship
does
not
apply
as
you
come
back
on
the
pier.
swanson
versus
marra
is
already
been
commented
upon.
and
attempt
in
that
case
was
made
to
avail
the
injured
longshoreman
of
the
jones
act.
he
could
not
file
a
suit
under
the
jones
act,
he
could
not
do
it
then,
he
cannot
do
it
now.
if
that
longshoreman
were
to
assert
his
claim
today,
there's
no
question
that
he
would
be
entitled
to
benefits
under
a
third
party
action.
with
reference
to
the
jensen
line
of
demarcation,
precisely
what
is
meant
by
that,
i
don't
think
it's
entirely
clear.
as
i
understand
the
phrase,
what
is
meant
is
this.
the
supreme
court
held
that
admiralty
is
exclusively
within
the
province
of
the
federal
government.
we
must
have
uniformity
in
maritime
law.
because
of
this
requirement
for
a
uniformity,
the
state,
through
its
workman's
compensation
cannot
invade
the
field
of
admiralty.
so
all
jensen
said
was
that
there
is
a
limitation
on
the
state,
not
to
legislate
in
this
field.
it
did
not
indicate
that
the
federal
government
had
no
authority
to
legislate
in
this
field
even
if
there
may
have
been
today
an
overlapping
with
reference
to
pier
injuries.
and
respecting
the
cases
mentioned
about
pier
injuries,
the
jensen
decision
has
been
termed
an
ill
starred
one.
some
commentators
have
felt
that
the
court
had
some
qualms
of
conscience
after
deciding
this
case
and
depriving
the
widow
of
any
compensation.
subsequently,
in
every
case
which
came
before
this
body,
when
there
was
an
award
in
favor
of
the
injured
man
or
his
widow
and
dependents,
this
court
upheld
it.
mr.
justice
black
devised
this
twilight
zone.
we
also
have
the
local
but
maritime.
the
court
sought
devices
to
get
around
that
so
we
don't
feel
that
the
holding
that
injuries
on
piers
have
been
recognized
as
state
convincible
have
any
real
bearing
because
they
do
not
denude
or
do
not
deprive
this
court
of
its
right
to
legislate
in
a
feel
which
peculiarly
is
its
own.
with
reference
to
the
legislative
history,
an
excerpt
was
given
from
one
of
the
reports.
if
you
review
the
legislative
history
in
detail,
you
will
note
that
everyone
connected
with
this
particular
problem
was
interested
in
obtaining
full
coverage.
the
government
representative,
the
man
from
the
u.s.
department
of
labor
statistics
said
he
wanted
the
job
covered,
not
the
man
when
he
was
on
a
particular
position.
the
representatives
of
the
ile,
the
union
involved
here,
similarly
said
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
where
he
performs
his
duties
whether
it's
on
the
ship
or
on
the
pier.
the
union
wanted
them—all
the
men
protected.
similarly,
industry,
one
of
the
more
protected.
gentlemen,
i
see
that
my
time
has
run
out.
i
urge
that
the
decision
of
the
lower
court
be
affirmed
on
the
basis
of
the
arguments
advanced
here
and
what
is
contained
in
our
briefs
and
also
in
the
opinion
of
former
chief
justice
sobeloff.
mr.
john
j.
o'connor,
jr.
i
should
like
to
define
the
issues
involved
in
these
cases.
at
the
conclusion
of
my
introductory
portion,
i'll
be
very
happy
to
proceed
in
which
ever
direction
you
suggest.
one,
discuss
the
points
set
forth
in
my
brief
but
in
a
different
sequence.
two,
limit
my
discussion
basically
to
the
philosophy
of
five
cases
of
this
court
commencing
with
o'donnell
versus
great
lakes
and
terminating
with
the
reed
decision.
or
three,
devoting
the
time
i
have
allotted
to
responding
to
any
questions
you
may
care
to
direct
to
me.
first
of
all,
these
cases
involve
longshoreman
who
are
members
of
a
gang,
a
work
unit,
actively
engaged
in
discharging
cargo
from
a
vessel
alongside
of
a
pier.
their
duties,
their
rest
periods,
their
lunch
periods
require
them
to
go
back
and
forth
between
the
vessel
and
the
pier.
they're
doing
the
same
work.
they're
receiving
the
same
pay.
they
are
exposed
to
the
same
risks.
we're
not
dealing
in
this
case
with
anyone
running
to
an
office
downtown,
anyone
working
in
a
machine
shop,
anyone
driving
a
laundry
truck.
my
second
point
is
the
issue
in
these
cases
is
not
of
constitutional
magnitude.
jensen,
stewart,
dawson
these
cases
held
that
admiralty
was
exclusively
federal
and
that
states
could
not
be
permitted
to
invade
that
domain
with
or
without
attempted
congressional
sanction.
the
crucial
question
in
these
cases
is
this.
may
the
federal
government
legislate
in
a
field
where
the
states
may
also
have
exercised
some
dominion?
these
other
cases
we're
looking
in
the
opposite
direction.
they
were
--
the
issue
there
was
one
of
permissiveness
by
this
court
and
not
a
limitation
on
the
power
or
the
authority
of
the
federal
government.
the
third
point,
there
are
two
basic
sources
of
jurisdiction
for
congress,
one
the
admiralty
article,
two
the
commerce
article.
i'm
afraid
i
must
differ
with
the
distinguished
solicitor
general
when
he
appeared
before
you
a
few
moments
ago.
he
indicated
that
the
exclusive
source
of
admiralty
jurisdiction
was
locality.
locality
determines
jurisdiction
with
reference
to
torts.
but
admiralty
also
has
the
contract
aspect
and
there,
it's
the
nature
of
the
contract
and
not
the
locality.
in
addition
to
this,
we
have
the
commerce
power.
these
two
powers
are
totally
separate
distinct
independent.
they
may
be
exercised
jointly
or
independently.
in
the
longshoreman
act,
congress
was
aware
of
and
actually
did
exercise
both
of
these
powers.
the
next
point
i
find
myself
in
agreement
with
the
solicitor
general,
we
feel
that
these
cases
revolve
about
the
correct
liberal
interpretation
of
the
simple
term
“upon
the
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states.”
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
this
term
applied
equally
to
all
structures
on
navigable
waters
whether
the
structure
happened
to
be
a
pier
or
a
ship.
and
also
to
all
injuries,
whether
the
longshoreman
happened
to
be
aboard
the
ship
on
the
deck,
or
on
the
deck
of
a
pier.
the
final
comment
in
this
introductory
portion
i
should
like
to
make
is
this
your
honors.
under
the
maryland
law,
the
widow
and
the
family
would
receive
a
maximum
of
$15,000.00,
under
the
federal
statute
the
benefits
will
be
in
the
neighborhood
of
$63,000.00.
we
submit
that
a
hidden
issue
in
this
case
the
cause
to
the
insurance
company
and
ultimately
to
the
stevedoring
contractor.
and
as
this
court
has
repeatedly
held
that
is
not
a
valid
issue.
the
human
cost
of
doing
business
should
be
born
by
the
industry
and
not
by
the
victim
of
the
industry.
the
--
before
i
leave
that,
i
think
mr.
justice
fortas
directed
a
question
to
the
solicitor
general
and
inquired
“suppose
we
have
a
floating
dry
dock
belay
that
a
floating
pier,
what
would
be
the
ruling
in
such
a
situation?”
well
it
so
happens
that
there
has
been
such
a
case.
and
this
is
illustrative
of
the
conflict
and
the
confusion
which
is
existing
throughout
the
country
today.
a
recovery
for
the
longshoreman
was
awarded
by
the
compensation
commissioner.
as
i
recalled
it,
this
recovery
was
affirmed
by
the
district
court.
it
then
went
up
to
the
appellate
level
in
the
fifth
circuit.
the
same
circuit
that
has
provided
several
of
the
authorities
relied
upon
by
the
petitioners
in
this
case.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
in
a
decision
in
1967,
i'm
not
sure
whether
it's
travelers
versus
shea
in
382
f.2d.
or
nicholson
versus
calbeck
in
385
f.2d.
but
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
and
held
that
the
injury
was
not
compensable
under
the
act.
now,
my
first
point,
if
you
wish
me
to
follow
the
brief
basically.
alright,
but
suppose
i
take
the
first
point
that
i
may
deviate
to
another
system
mr.
chief
justice.
my
first
point
is,
in
addition
to
mean
factually
upon
navigable
waters,
piers
or
their
indispensable
edge-ons,
the
facts
of
these
cases
are
conceded.
we
might
say
that
there's
a
veritable
tidal
wave
of
navigable
waters
in
these
cases.
first,
we
have
the
solicitor
general's
brief.
he
says
the
relevant
facts
are
not
in
dispute.
then
we
have
the
admissions
on
the
pleadings
and
the
klosek
and
johnson
cases.
i'm
on
page
29
of
my
brief
at
this
point.
and
of
course
in
these
undisputed
verities
is
the
fact
the
piers
involved
on
our
controversy
are
“upon
navigable
waters.”
now
going
back
to
johnson
and
klosek,
in
our
complaint
for
review
which
was
filed
on
the
admiralty
side
in
the
district
of
maryland,
we
asserted
“the
complainant
was
working
as
a
longshoreman
on
the
600
foot
bethlehem
steel
high
pier
located
upon
navigable
waters”
that's
our
allegation.
paragraph
two
of
the
answer
of
the
petitioner
in
nacirema
in
this
particular
case
reads
as
follows.
“this
respondent
admits
the
matters
and
facts
alleged
in
the
second
article
of
the
complaint.”
turning
our
attention
briefly
to
the
avery
case,
there
is
an
expressed
stipulation
to
that
effect.
that
appears
at
page
9
of
the
appendix
that
the
pier
is
upon
navigable
waters.
over
and
above
that,
in
the
finding
of
fact
by
deputy
commissioner
traynor,
he
held
as
a
fact
“the
surface
of
the
pier
is
situated
over
the
navigable
waters.”
and
of
course
we
have
the
admissions
made
by
mr.
coleman
when
he
first
appeared
before
you.
he
stated
“there's
no
question
that
the
patapsco
river
is
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states.”
point
three
of
his
concession
was
that
the
pier
was
located
on
pilings
and
its
small
boats
could
navigate
under
them.
it
is
our
position
that
this
often
by
itself
is
dispositive
of
the
issue
involved
in
this
case.
now,
suppose
i
pass
on
to
an
analysis
of
the
principle
and
philosophy
in
the
--
what
i
consider
the
five
leading
cases.
my
brief,
i
believe,
contains
references
to
60
some
odd
cases.
i
think
these
are
the
most
important.
the
first
one
is
o'donnell
versus
great
lakes
dredge
and
dry
--
dock
company.
this
particular
decision
involved
a
suit
by
a
seaman
incidentally
where
back
in
--
that's
right
1943.
this
case
involved
a
suit
by
a
seaman
who
was
working
on
a
type
of
vessel
that
transported
sand.
this
sand
was
taken
ashore
by
some
sort
of
a
pipeline
system.
he
was
ashore
repairing
a
gasket
on
this
discharging
device.
he
filed
a
suit
under
the
jones
act
and
his
claim
was
denied
by
the
lower
court.
this
court
entertained
certiorari,
issued
the
writ
and
the
case
came
up
for
disposition.
now,
we
feel
that
it's
extremely
interesting
to
note
that
o'donnell
in
1943
interpreted
the
scope
of
the
jones
act
and
fundamentally
the
same
words
as
this
court
did
some
20
years
later
when
it
delineated
the
borders
of
the
longshoreman's
act
in
calbeck.
in
o'donnell
mr.
chief
justice
stone
in
resisting
an
attempt
to
restrict
the
coverage
of
this
beneficial
seaman's
act
stated,
i
quote
this
is
on
page
39
of
the
opinion.
“congress
in
the
absence
of
any
indication
of
a
different
purpose,
must
be
taken
to
have
intended
to
make
them”
--
them
is
the
words
of
the
jones
act
--
“make
them
so
far
as
the
words
and
the
constitution
permit
and
to
have
given
to
them
the
full
support
of
all
the
constitutional
power
it
possesses,
hence
the
act
allows
the
recovery
sought
unless
the
constitution
forbids
it.”
that
is
the
end
of
the
quotation.
the
jones
act
as
you
may
recall
was
passed
in
1920.
it
took
that
act
23
years
to
come
before
this
court
for
the
final
interpretation.
the
longshoreman
act
is
taken
a
bit
longer.
the
second
case
i
should
like
to
discuss
briefly
with
you
is
avondale
marine
ways
versus
henderson.
this
is
a
1953
decision
of
this
court
in
which
the
court
issued
a
per
curiam
decision
representing
the
views
of
eight
members
of
the
court.
there
was
no
dissent,
one
judge
did
not
participate.
o'donnell
i
believe
was
also
a
unanimous
decision.
in
avondale,
the
court
was
dealing
with
a
dry
dock
case.
the
longshoreman
act
covers
two
categories
of
workers.
it
covers
your
longshoreman
who's
working
on
the
pier
and
the
ship
and
also
covers
your
dry
dock
employees.
in
avondale,
the
situation
is
set
forth
in
a
footnote
in
the
lower
court's
opinion.
the
factual
backdrop
was
this,
this
is
footnote
2.
by
stipulation
or
by
the
uncontroverted
testimony,
it
was
established
that
at
the
time
of
the
explosion
on
the
barge,
the
barge
had
been
hauled
out
of
the
mississippi
river
on
the
cradle
of
a
marine
railway.
we're
dealing
with
a
marine
railway
not
technically
a
dry
dock.
and
that
both
cradle
and
barge
at
the
time
of
the
explosion
and
for
sometime
previously
thereto,
had
been
at
rest
ashore
at
a
point
400
feet
from
the
water.
to
the
predecessor
court,
it
was
so
obvious
that
the
longshoreman
act
should
be
liberally
construed
and
applied.
it
did
not
even
bother
with
writing
an
opinion.
it
had
a
one
sentence
per
curiam
affirming
an
award
in
favor
of
the
man
who
was
injured
on
this
barge
400
feet
inland
of
navigable
waters.
not
on
a
dry
dock
but
on
a
marine
railway.
our
analogy
there
is
that
if
the
dry
dock
portion
of
coverage
is
to
be
applied
with
sufficient
liberality
as
to
embrace
someone
400
feet
inland,
certainly
a
man
injured
on
a
pier
just
a
few
feet
from
the
edge
of
the
ship
and
still
at
that
time
physically
upon
navigable
waters
should
also
be
held
to
be
encompassed
within
the
protection
intended
by
congress
when
this
act
was
passed
back
in
1937.
the
third
case
of
course
is
our
incomparable
calbeck.
that
has
been
pretty
well
commented
upon
already.
i
don't
know
whether
any
further
elaboration
is
required
at
this
time.
i
don't
want
to
belabor
it.
the
courts
have
not
concurred
in
the
views
expressed
by
mr.
coleman
when
he
tries
to
place
a
very
limited
application
on
this
case.
now
as
we
all
know,
a
case
has
basically
two
components.
first
it
has
the
precise
determination
of
the
issue
based
on
the
particular
facts.
secondly,
from
that
precise
determination
it
transcends
into
establishing
or
following
a
principle.
now
the
principle
of
law,
we
all
know
the
facts
of
calbeck.
simply
that
although
in
the
past
state
camp
was
held
applicable
to
a
launched
but
uncompleted
ship.
the
lower
court
i
think
said
it's
about
57%
complete.
although
the
past
law
stated
that
the
state
could
award
compensation.
calbeck
held
that
nevertheless
the
compensation,
the
longshoreman's
compensation
act
also
applied
to
that
situation.
and
the
mere
fact
that
there
may
have
been
recognized
or
permitted
stated
jurisdiction
did
not
oust
the
federal
government
either
congress
or
the
courts
of
its
or
their
control
and
jurisdiction
over
admiralty
matters
and
navigable
water.
we
feel
we
have
the
same
precise
situation
here.
in
calbeck,
there's
no
question
that
the
statutes
of
louisiana
could
apply
too
and
be
availed
out
by
that
workman.
similarly
here,
there's
no
question
that
the
statutes,
the
workman's
compensation
of
maryland
could
apply
to
mr.
johnson
and
also
to
the
widow
of
mrs.
klosek.
but
we
submit
that
is
totally
insignificant.
this
case
is
not
one
of
constitutional
scope.
we're
not
determining
how
far
can
the
states
go.
we're
merely
deciding
if
the
state
was
permitted
in
the
past
to
exercise
some
jurisdiction
in
this
field.
does
that
mean
if
we
have
been
ousted
of
our
tradition
authority,
which
of
course
is
all
way
back
of
1789?
the
next
--
mr.
john
j.
o'connor,
jr.
what
is
that
mr.
justice
fortas?
mr.
john
j.
o'connor,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
j.
o'connor,
jr.
well
calbeck
very
effectively
disposed
of
that
sir.
i'll
see
if
i
can
get
the
precise
quotation
from
that
decision.
yes
sir,
on
page
117
of
370
u.s.,
this
court
asserted.
let's
see,
that
was
a
6
to
2
decision.
“our
conclusion
is
that
congress
invoked
its
constitutional
power
so
as
to
provide
compensation
for
all
injuries
sustained
by
employees
on
navigable
waters
whether
or
not
a
particular
injury
might
also
have
been
within
the
constitutional
reach
of
a
state
workman's
compensation
law.”
mr.
john
j.
o'connor,
jr.
yes,
sir.
that
was
one
of
the
main
points
that
was
emphasized
and
stressed
in
the
calbeck
case,
in
the
briefs
and
also
in
the
opinion
of,
i
forgot
who
authored
the
opinion
in
the
fifth
circuit.
is
there
any
further
elaboration
you
would
like
sir?
mr.
john
j.
o'connor,
jr.
thank
you
mr.
justice
fortas.
the
next
case
i
should
like
to
discuss
briefly
with
your
honors
is
gutierrez
versus
waterman
steamship
corporation
decided
in
1963,
and
authored
by
mr.
justice
white.
that
was
a
decision
by
this
court
that
divided
the
8
to
1.
this
is
frequently
been
referred
to
as
the
“beans
on
the
dock
case”
in
puerto
rico.
a
longshoreman
filed
a
suit
and
recovered
in
his
action.
this
was
appealed
to
the
first
circuit
and
the
lower
court's
decision
was
reversed.
the
recovery
was
taken
away
from
him.
then
it
came
up
before
this
court
on
writ.
i'd
like
to
read
these
excerpts
from
the
opinion.
this
is
209
of
373
u.s.
“respondent
contends
that
it
is
not
liable
at
least
in
admiralty
because
the
impact
of
its
alleged
lack
of
care
or
unseaworthiness
was
felt
on
the
pier
rather
than
aboard
ship.
whatever
validity
this
proposition
may
have
had
until
1948,
the
passage
of
the
extension
of
admiralty
jurisdiction
act
swept
it
away
when
it
made
vessels
on
navigable
water
“liable
for
‘damages
or
injury'
not
withstanding
that
such
damage
or
injury
may
be
done
or
consummated
on
land.”
on
page
210
we
find
this
excerpt
and
i
read
it
principally
because
of
the
situations
conjured
up
in
the
brief
submitted
by
an
amicus
on
behalf
of
petitioners.
“various
farfetched
hypotheticals
are
raised
such
as
a
suit
in
admiralty
for
an
ordinary
automobile
accident
involving
a
ship's
officer
on
ship's
business
and
port,
or
for
someone
slipping
on
beans
that
continue
to
leak
from
these
bags
in
a
warehouse
in
denver.
we
think
it's
sufficient
for
the
needs
of
this
occasion
to
hold
that
the
case
is
within
the
maritime
jurisdiction
under
46
u.s.c.
section
740,
when
as
here
it
is
alleged
that
the
shipowner
commits
a
tort
while
or
before
the
ship
is
being
unloaded.
and
the
impact
of
which
is
felt
assure
at
a
time
and
place
not
remote
from
the
wrongful
act.”
mr.
john
j.
o'connor,
jr.
this
quotation
your
honor?
from
gutierrez,
the
gutierrez
decision.
the
final
excerpt
is
this
brief
paragraphed
on
page
215
of
the
same
decision.
“we
agree
with
this
reading
of
the
case
law
and
hold
that
the
duty
to
provide
a
seaworthy
ship
and
gear,
including
cargo
containers
applies
to
longshoremen
unloading
the
ship
whether
they
are
standing
aboard
ship
or
on
the
pier.”
we
think
we
have
a
very
analogous
situation
here.
we
feel
that
the
longshoreman
act
applies
whether
the
man
is
on
the
deck
of
the
ship
or
on
the
deck
of
the
pier.
and
the
basis
of
that
is
that
the
foundation
of
the
longshoreman
act
is
the
admiralty
power
of
the
united
states.
it
is
the
same
power
which
gave
rise
to
the
enactment
of
the
jones
act,
which
again
was
an
employer-employee
relationship.
the
admiralty
article
of
the
constitution
also
confers
admiralty
jurisdiction
on
this
court.
this
court
in
exercise
of
that
jurisdiction
and
in
recognition
of
its
humanitarian
objective
to
protect
maritime
workers
has
been
constantly
extending
the
seaworthiness
or
the
unseaworthiness
doctrine.
we
feel
that
it's
almost
incomprehensible
to
hold
that
this
open-end
unseaworthiness
protection
is
available
to
a
longshoreman
if
he's
injured
on
the
pier,
and
yet
the
protection
expressly
designed
for
him
by
the
longshoreman
act
has
denied
him
when
he
is
injured
on
that
same
pier.
the
final
case
is
reed
versus
s.s.
yaka.
that
was
decided
the
same
term
of
the
court
1963.
this
particular
opinion
was
authored
by
mr.
justice
black.
it
represented
the
views
of
seven
members
of
the
court.
in
that
case,
we
were
dealing
with
a
situation
where
the
injured
person
filed
suit
against
the
bareboat
charterer
who
was
also
his
employer.
there
was
a
provision
in
the
act
which
exonerated
the
employer
from
a
damage
suit.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
since
a
suit
could
not
be
instituted
in
personam,
therefore
a
suit
could
not
be
instituted
in
rem.
this
of
course
was
an
in
rem
proceeding,
so
the
lower
court
held
that
he
had
no
cause
of
action.
this
court
took
the
case
and
of
course
held
otherwise.
i'm
reading
now
from
page
415
of
373
u.s.
we
have
previously
said
that
the
longshoreman's
act
“must
be
liberally
construed
in
conformance
with
its
purpose
and
in
a
way
which
avoids
harsh
and
incongruous
results.”
we
think
it
would
produce
a
harsh
and
incongruous
result
one
out
of
keeping
with
a
dominant
intent
of
congress
to
help
longshoreman
to
distinguish
between
liability
to
longshoremen
injured
under
precisely
the
same
circumstances,
because
some
draw
their
pay
directly
from
a
shipowner,
and
others
from
a
stevedoring
company
doing
the
ships
service.
the
analogy
here
i
think
was
sort
of
anticipated
by
mr.
justice
fortas
when
he
said,
“suppose
this
sling
of
cargo
struck
two
men
working
on
the
pier,
just
knocking
one
down
or
over
to
the
edge
of
the
pier
and
flushing
the
other
one
off
into
the
water.
the
one
that
went
into
the
water
would
be
covered.
the
one
who
had
the
misfortune
to
just
be
knocked
sideways
a
little
distance
would
not
be
covered
under
our
--
under
the
theory
that
is
argued
for
by
the
petitioners
in
this
particular
case.”
and
we
say
this
would
be
harsh
and
incongruous
result,
because
their
dawned
the
same
precise
type
of
work.
mr.
john
j.
o'connor,
jr.
i
really
can't
directly
answer
that
sir.
i
tried
to
find
out
mr.
justice
white
just
at
what
point
a
pier
being
an
extension
of
land
came
into
the
law
books.
and
i
couldn't
locate
it.
now
it
makes
--
mr.
john
j.
o'connor,
jr.
i
wish
i
could
answer
that
sir
but
i
can't.
perhaps
the
solicitor
general
when
he
comes
back
before
you
may
be
able
to
fill
that
void.
mr.
john
j.
o'connor,
jr.
yes
sir,
i
am.
mr.
john
j.
o'connor,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
j.
o'connor,
jr.
well,
possibly
the
--
back
in
1865
or
thereabout
that
was
a
situation
where
for
some
sparks
from
the
funnel
set
fire
on
the
shore.
mr.
john
j.
o'connor,
jr.
the
jensen
line
your
honor,
as
i
understand
it,
is
solely
a
decision
that
the
states
cannot
legislate
in
the
admiralty
field.
for
the
simple
reason
that
must
be
uniform
--
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
john
j.
o'connor,
jr.
jensen
itself,
your
honor
--
jensen
was
a
longshoreman
who
operated
an
electric
truck
who
went
back
and
forth
from
the
pier
to
the
ship.
he
was
killed
when
he
was
taking
cargo
out
off
the
ship's
hold
on
to
the
gangway.
it
somehow
it
became
filed
up,
he
went
back
and
he
hit
his
head
on
the
ship
and
sustained
a
broken
neck.
so
jensen
sustained
his
injury
as
a
result
of
striking
the
ship.
it
was
held
that
his
injury
was
within
the
federal
domain
and
that
the
new
york
state
compensation
act
could
not
be
applied.
that's
the
factual
backdrop
of
the
jensen
decision.
following
that
we
have
dawson
and
knickerbocker-ice
case,
and
the
--
belay
that.
following
that,
congress
tried
to
pass
two
different
laws,
but
neither
one
passed
judicial
scrutiny
by
this
court
because
both
laws
tried
to
confer
on
the
state
authority
to
act
in
this
field.
and
this
court
stated
that
that
would
interfere
with,
disrupt
and
perhaps
destroy
the
uniformity
that
we
must
have
in
the
admiralty
field.
mr.
john
j.
o'connor,
jr.
that
escapes
me,
your
honor,
because
this
court
has
never
held
that
congress
did
not
have
the
authority
to
legislate
in
this
particular
field.
i
think
one
of
your
questions
directed
to
mr.
coleman
and
--
mr.
john
j.
o'connor,
jr.
well
i
don't
think
it's
--
mr.
john
j.
o'connor,
jr.
there
are
--
yes
sir.
there
are
dictas
in
the
various
decisions
which
expressly
refer
to
the
jensen
line
of
demarcation.
that
is
absolutely
correct.
mr.
john
j.
o'connor,
jr.
i
don't
know.
jensen
actually
was
injured
as
a
result
of
a
ship
--
might
i
say
ship
born
injury
because
he
struck
the
side
of
the
ship.
and
also,
it's
been
universally
held
that
a
--
except
that
i
shouldn't
say
held,
because
i
don't
think
it's
been
expressly
before
this
court
in
dicta
has
appeared
in
different
cases.
it
has
been
sort
of
universally
accepted
that
on
board
ship
or
on
board
the
gangway
federal
on
the
pier
state.
i
believe
at
one
time
with
reference
to
pier
injuries,
they
even
held
that
depends
on
what
direction
what
you're
going.
if
you're
going
from
the
pier
to
the
ship,
it's
land.
if
you're
coming
from
the
ship
to
the
pier,
you're
still
on
a
ship
until
you
reach
the
pier.
but
i
think
these
hairsplitting
distinctions
have
all
been
done
away
with.
and
again
your
honor,
i
think
we're
dealing
in
this
particular
case
or
these
cases
with
a
liberal
interpretation
of
a
liberal
statute,
workman's
compensation
law.
so
these
distinctions
which
might
have
to
be
measured
by
maybe
johansen
blocks
the
real
delicate
calipers
shouldn't
take
up
the
time
of
the
court,
where
i
think
we
should
be
dealing
what
is
fair
and
equitable
and
what
did
congress
intend
by
passing
this
act
to
aid
and
assist
these
men
that
were
exposed
to
these
numerous
damages
and
injuries
because
of
the
hazards
of
their
occupation.
the
final
excerpt
from
reed
versus
yaka
is
the
following.
“as
we
said
in
a
slightly
different
factual
context
all
were
subjected
to
the
same
danger,
all
were
entitled
to
light
treatment
under
law.”
in
the
conclusion
portion
of
my
brief
commencing
on
page
34,
i
set
forth
various
anomalies
and
bizarre
situations
which
the
petitioners
are
requesting
this
court
to
ratify
and
support.
if
i
may
touch
briefly
upon
the
legislative
history
of
the
act,
if
one
thing
stands
out
pre-eminently,
it's
the
congressional
resolve
to
avoid
the
constitutional
pitfall
of
lack
of
uniformity
which
caused
congress
to
stumble
in
its
two
earlier
attempts
to
help
longshoremen.
the
preoccupation
of
the
chairman
with
uniformity
and
his
apprehensiveness
over
its
possible
vitiating
absence,
seamen
were
left
out
of
the
act.
the
only
omission
to
seamen,
everything
else
there
is
to
extend
and
enlarge
it
that's
why
they
put
in
“including
any
dry
dock”,
because
in
normal
common
sense
factual
appraisal,
a
dry
dock
is
not
upon
navigable
waters.
so
that
was
a
term
of
inclusion.
the
chairman
was
concerned
because
seamen
were
omitted.
and
this
preoccupation
is
apparent
throughout
all
the
proceedings,
the
senate
hearings
and
also
the
hearings
before
the
house
of
representatives.
now
with
represent
--
with
reference
to
the
uniformity
of
full
coverage,
there
was
just
about
unanimous
accord.
the
committees
in
both
houses
wanted
to
avoid
the
constitutional
flaw
in
the
law.
labor
both
the
ila
and
the
shipyard
unions
wanted
full
coverage.
management
supported
it,
in
fact
mr.
keating
was
very
critical
who
represented
the
shipowners
and
a
very
noted
admiralty
proctor
at
that
time.
he
was
critical
of
the
act
because
he
was
afraid
that
wasn't
embracive
enough,
it
didn't
include
everyone.
and
that
was
one
of
the
reasons
why
they
changed
the
terminology
from
a
place
upon
--
place
in
admiralty
jurisdiction
and
provided
that
it's
not
a
question
of
local
concern
and
whatnot.
the
government
agency
entrusted
with
the
administration
of
the
act
when
it
all
facets
of
the
job
covered.
and
to
argue
that
the
congress
of
the
united
states
deliberately
excluded
25%
of
the
longshoreman
workforce,
statistically
25
were
on
the
pier
and
75
are
aboard
ship.
to
argue
that,
that
they're
not
protected
by
the
act
is
driving
to
defeat
the
very
uniformity
that
congress
not
only
strove
for
but
actually
achieved.
my
final
comment
will
be
this
your
honors.
it
may
come
as
a
shock
to
petitioners
who
are
so
patently
outnumbered
of
some
pre-1927
views,
but
one
can
not
thrust
the
mighty
42-year
oak
of
the
act
back
into
its
embryonic
acorn.
both
the
seaworthiness
doctrine
and
the
act,
and
we
may
also
interpolate
here
the
jones
act
as
well,
are
traceable
to
a
common
origin
solicitude
for
maritime
workers
who
spend
their
lives
in
such
a
hazardous
occupation.
as
the
seaworthiness
doctrine
has
grown,
as
the
application
of
the
jones
act
has
been
extended,
these
have
expanded
these
have
developed
down
through
the
years,
so
to
it
is
respectfully
submitted
must
the
longshoreman
act.
thank
you.
mr.
john
j.
o'connor,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
as
we
understand
the
issue
in
these
cases
that
is
this,
does
the
longshoreman's
act
cover
injuries
occurring
“upon
the
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states.”
whether
on
the
deck
of
a
pier
as
well
as
on
the
deck
of
a
ship
when
the
precipitating
instrumentality
is
a
ship
a
word
crane.
by
a
solid
five
to
two
embank
decision,
the
court
of
appeals
for
our
fourth
circuit
held
that
such
a
pier
side
injury
was
compensable
under
the
act.
the
four
bases
of
the
holding
are
set
forth
on
pages
2
and
3
of
our
original
brief.
former
chief
judge
sobeloff
altered
a
masterful
opinion
which
carefully
considered
and
rejected
the
various
arguments
advanced
before
this
court
today.
these
cases
involved
longshoreman
members
of
a
six
team
man
gang,
a
definite
work
unit
actively
engaged
in
loading
ocean
going
freighters.
their
duties,
there
are
rest
periods,
there
are
lunch
periods,
all
require
them
to
go
back
and
forth
between
the
vessel
and
the
pier.
they
were
doing
the
same
work,
they
were
receiving
the
same
pay.
they
were
exposed
to
the
same
risks.
they
were
employed
by
the
same
corporation.
the
thrust
of
our
argument
is
that
they
were
entitled
to
the
same
workman's
compensation.
in
the
last
analysis,
as
the
solicitor
general
indicated,
we
can
reduce
these
cases
to
their
simplest
component.
they
revolve
about
the
correct
liberal
interpretation
of
the
phrase
“upon
the
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states.”
in
the
opinion
authored
by
judge
sobeloff,
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
this
term
applied
equally
to
all
structures
on
navigable
waters,
whether
the
structure
happen
to
be
a
ship
or
whether
the
structure
happen
to
be
a
pier.
a
ship
actually
displaces
more
water
than
does
a
pier
and
someone
on
a
pier
is
considerably
closer
to
the
level
of
navigable
waters
than
someone
on
a
deck
of
a
ship
which
may
be
15
to
50
feet
above
the
surface
of
the
navigable
waters.
now,
we
hear
and
frequently
this
particular
phrase
as
banded
about,
a
pier
is
an
extension
of
the
land.
we
submit
that
that
is
inaccurate
factually
as
it
is
historically.
logically
and
functionally,
a
pier
is
an
extension
of
the
ship.
it
is
really
nothing
more
than
an
oversized
gangway.
a
pier
cannot
be
conceived
of
except
in
connection
with
navigable
waters
and
a
ship.
servicing
a
vessel,
facilitating
its
loading
or
discharging
is
its
reson
d'etre.
in
the
words
of
johnson
company
versus
garrison,
a
1914
decision
of
this
court,
“the
mooring
of
a
vessel
is
as
necessary
as
its
movement.”
and
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
california
came
to
their
common
sense
conclusion
that
a
pier
is
an
extension
of
a
ship.
in
the
immigration
case
of
united
states
versus
yi
ni
hau,
a
1952
decision
reported
in
105
f.
supp.
at
page
517,
going
into
the
history
of
the
situation,
in
the
waiting
decades
of
the
17th
century,
louis
xiv
of
france
promulgated
his
ordinans
de
la
marin.
this

answer:
“wrongs
committed
upon
the
seas,
at
ports,
harbors
and
beaches.”
when
the
courts
restrictively
applied
his
instructions,
the
king
issued
a
clarifying
directive
in
1694
known
as
the
royal
declaration.
he
reiterated
the
comprehensive
scope
of
admiralty.
benedict
on
admiralty
in
a
pre-1865
edition,
i
found
this
in
my
notes
but
i
have
not
been
able
to
confirm
it
but
i'm
sure
it
is
accurate,
in
section
107,
advisers
that
at
the
time
of
the
commonwealth,
admiralty
jurisdiction
included
“all
cases
of
prejudice
to
the
banks
of
navigable
rivers.”
or
to
“docks,
wharfs
and
keys.”
and
the
language
of
commissions
issued
to
admiralty
judges
read
in
part
“all
injuries
done
upon
the
public
rivers
and
upon
the
shores
and
banks
adjoining
them.”
and
as
we
all
know
the
lien
of
a
war
finger
is
recognized
and
enforced
in
admiralty.
and
they
come
down
to
a
more
recent
decision
out
of
this
court,
united
states
versus
louisiana,
1967,
the
denial
of
that
fictional
theory,
a
pier
is
an
extension
of
the
land
is
implicit
in
this
decision
which
held
that
the
natural
shoreline
of
1845
was
the
correct
line
of
demarcation
for
measuring
the
three
marine
lakes.
the
case
decided
that
a
jetty
was
not
an
extension
of
land
to
push
the
boundary
beyond
a
normal
three
marine
lake
figure.
a
pier
similarly
does
not
extend
the
jurisdiction
of
a
state.
it
still
is
measured
from
a
natural
shoreline
with
a
high
watermark.
we're
somewhat
baffled
at
the
position
of
the
solicitor
general
in
these
cases
because
we
had
occasion
to
read
the
splendid
brief
that
he
filed
in
the
calbeck
case.
on
page
51
he
had
this
to
say,
“where
injured
employee
sought
recovery
under
the
state
act,
the
presumption
of
constitutionality
would
sustain
and
award.
similarly,
the
statutory
presumption
in
the
longshoreman's
act
could
sustain
and
award
in
the
very
same
circumstances.
the
two
presumptions
in
effect
gave
the
employee
injured
in
the
twilight
zone
an
election
to
proceed
under
federal
or
state
law.”
let's
turn
our
attention
to
the
philosophy
of
workman's
compensation
law.
workman's
compensation
is
a
recognition
for
the
protection
and
compensation
of
persons
who
are
injured
in
work
connected
activities.
since
the
act
is
remedial
legislation,
it
is
to
be
applied
with
the
broadest
liberality
to
achieve
its
humanitarian
purposes.
the
court
of
appeals
has
directed
the
entry
of
an
award
in
these
cases.
as
judge
palmerri
admonished
in
the
michigan
mutual
case,
a
federal
compensation
should
be
upheld
“if
there
is
any
reasonable
argument
for
coverage
under
the
act.”
there
is
considerably
more
than
a
reasonable
argument
for
coverage
under
the
act
in
these
cases.
as
this
court
has
admonished,
we
are
to
avoid
“harsh
and
in
congress
results.”
and
as
a
decision
in
the
fourth
circuit
urged,
the
acts
beneficent
purposes
are
not
to
be
“frustrated
by
needless
refinements.”
the
philosophy
of
workman's
compensation
statutes
is
protected.
liability
arises
as
an
incident
of
the
employment
relationship.
it
is
related
to
the
contract
of
employment.
it
is
not
predicated
on
fault
as
in
tort
actions.
let's
turn
our
attention
to
the
actual
wording
of
the
statute.
the
key
expression
in
these
cases
is
“if
a
disability
or
death
results
from
an
injury
occurring
upon
the
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states
(including
any
dry
dock).”
the
touch
tone
of
coverage
is
this
generic
phrase,
upon
the
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states.
now,
congress
could
very
easily
have
restricted
the
application
of
this
law
by
a
simple
provision
such
as
“occurring
upon
a
ship
(including
the
gangway)”
but
congress
did
not.
it
used
the
very
generic,
broad
terminology
because
it
wanted
everyone
under
the
umbrella
of
its
protection.
mr.
john
j.
o'connor,
jr.
ah
--
yes,
sir.
obviously
it
could
but
as
was
pointed
out,
a
pier
is
clearly
upon
navigable
waters.
a
dry
dock
is
not
so
clearly
upon
navigable
waters.
i
understand
they
gauged
out
an
area
and
they
permit
the
waters
to
flow
into
that
part
that
was
formally
dry
land.
but
your
pier
is
in
a
different
category,
it
does
not
replace
the
navigable
waters,
the
navigable
waters
flow
freely
underneath
the
deck
of
the
pier.
mr.
john
j.
o'connor,
jr.
i
think
a
bridge
is
on
a
different
--
mr.
john
j.
o'connor,
jr.
ah
--
i
think
that's
a
little
bit
different
situation
your
honor
because
a
bridge
connects
two
segments
of
land.
so,
a
bridge
is
more
closely
alive
with
a
brand
operation.
mr.
john
j.
o'connor,
jr.
i
suppose
technically
your
honor,
upon
navigable
waters
you
could
say
that
someone
on
a
bridge
is
upon
navigable
waters
just
as
someone
on
a
pier.
just
as
the
courts
have
held
someone
locked
in
an
airplane
in
dollarman
case
is
upon
the
high
seas
although
he
is
several
thousand
feet
up
in
the
air.
now,
let's
look
at
some
illustrative
situations.
according
to
the
petitioner's
concept
of
the
law,
they
can
see
that
if
the
same
load
involved
in
these
proceedings,
a,
struck
and
crushed
a
longshoreman
in
the
hold,
the
injury
would
be
covered
by
the
act.
b,
struck
and
crushed
the
longshoreman
on
deck,
the
injury
would
be
covered.
c,
struck
and
crushed
the
longshoreman
on
the
gangway,
the
injury
would
be
covered.
d,
knocked
the
longshoreman
from
the
ship
onto
the
pier,
the
injury
would
be
covered.
e,
knocked
the
longshoreman
on
the
pier
into
the
water,
again
coverage.
f,
struck
and
crushed
the
longshoreman
in
a
boat
under
the
pier,
he
would
be
covered.
g,
lifted
the
longshoreman
up
and
dropped
him
back
to
the
pier,
the
injury
would
be
covered.
h,
as
we
all
know
if
we
had
a
third
party
action,
he
could
recover
under
the
seaworthiness
doctrine,
under
(inaudible)
and
the
extension
of
admiralty.
now
under
these
factual
situations,
they
admit
coverage
under
the
act.
but
if
the
longshoreman
is
struck
on
the
pier
and
merely
not
horizontally
but
remains
on
the
pier,
his
injury
are
dealt,
according
to
them
is
not
covered.
obviously
congress
never
intended
such
a
bizarre
result.
at
the
earlier
arguments,
some
members
of
the
court
asked
about
situations
of
this
type.
we're
sure
that
congress
be
an
equally
and
practically
minded
thought
of
similar
situations
and
they
devised
an
act
intended
to
bring
all
of
these
men,
these
longshoremen
within
their
protective
coverage
of
the
statute.
mr.
john
j.
o'connor,
jr.
well,
i
would
say
--
i
think
your
honor
if
you
are
injured
on
the
pier,
i
think
it's
compensable
but
that
brings
us
to
the
next
point,
our
case
has
an
additional
maritime
or
admiralty
nexus
because
the
upending
instrumentality
was
not
on
the
shore
but
on
the
vessel
itself.
mr.
john
j.
o'connor,
jr.
i
say
as
far
as
the
liberal
purpose
of
the
longshoreman's
act
is
concerned,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
it
makes
any
difference.
mr.
john
j.
o'connor,
jr.
no,
sir.
because
here,
you
have
the
additional
connection
with
the
admiralty
activity.
you
have
a
ship
ward
claim.
mr.
john
j.
o'connor,
jr.
on
the
--
no,
sir.
if
a
man
is
on
the
building
on
the
shore,
i
do
not
say
he's
covered.
i
say
he's
on
the
pier.
mr.
john
j.
o'connor,
jr.
yes,
sir.
i
say
he's
covered.
mr.
john
j.
o'connor,
jr.
well,
if
he's
upon
navigable
waters,
yes
sir
because
that's
a
touchstone
of
jurisdiction
and
your
honor
we
have
--
with
reference
to
the
basis
of
this
law,
we
have
the
tort
jurisdiction
of
admiralty
and
we
have
the
contract
jurisdiction
of
admiralty.
the
contract
of
course,
pertains
to
the
nature
of
the
activity.
but
over
and
above
the
admiralty
basis,
we
have
the
commerce
clause
and
at
the
very
first
hearing
conducted
into
the
act,
reference
was
made
to
the
applicability
of
the
commerce
clause
and
we
don't
even
theoretically
need
admiralty
of
waters
because
your
commerce
gives
the
congress
authority
over
the
activity
because
of
this
interstate
nature.
we
feel
that
the
fallacy
of
the
position
may
be
brought
out
a
bit
more
clearly
if
we
use
this
illustration.
if
a
group
of
men
were
employed
to
work
in
a
warehouse
and
during
the
course
of
the
employment,
a
load
broke
free
and
injured
someone
in
the
warehouse,
the
same
load
also
injured
someone
on
the
steps
of
the
warehouse
and
the
same
load
rolled
down
and
injured
someone
on
the
sidewall.
all
three
members
or
members
of
the
gang,
members
of
this
work
detail
and
employed
by
this
warehouse.
the
employer
and
the
insurer
came
into
court
and
suggested
that
the
man
working
on
the
sidewalk
was
not
entitled
to
the
same
protection
and
the
same
law
as
his
co-employees
working
in
the
building
and
on
the
steps
over
the
gangway.
i'm
sure
this
court
would
lose
no
time
in
stating
that
that
is
offensive
to
the
due
process
provision.
and
the
court
is
held
that
this
is
a
limitation
not
only
in
state
laws
but
it
should
also
be
applied
to
federal
statutes
to
prevent
unfair
discrimination.
perhaps,
i
should
now
respond
to
some
of
the
remarks
made
by
the
other
side
during
the
presentation
of
their
case.
the
initial
concession
made
by
mr.
coleman
was
that
the
piers
did
extend
out
over
the
navigable
waters.
we
feel
this
is
disposative
of
the
case.
and
he
also
admitted
that
the
men
passed
freely
back
and
forth
between
the
ship
and
the
pier.
we
cannot
conceive
that
congress
intended
to
have
a
part
time
statute
that
applies
as
a
pendulum.
as
you
go
aboard
ship
does
not
apply
as
you
come
back
on
the
pier.
swanson
versus
marra
is
already
been
commented
upon.
and
attempt
in
that
case
was
made
to
avail
the
injured
longshoreman
of
the
jones
act.
he
could
not
file
a
suit
under
the
jones
act,
he
could
not
do
it
then,
he
cannot
do
it
now.
if
that
longshoreman
were
to
assert
his
claim
today,
there's
no
question
that
he
would
be
entitled
to
benefits
under
a
third
party
action.
with
reference
to
the
jensen
line
of
demarcation,
precisely
what
is
meant
by
that,
i
don't
think
it's
entirely
clear.
as
i
understand
the
phrase,
what
is
meant
is
this.
the
supreme
court
held
that
admiralty
is
exclusively
within
the
province
of
the
federal
government.
we
must
have
uniformity
in
maritime
law.
because
of
this
requirement
for
a
uniformity,
the
state,
through
its
workman's
compensation
cannot
invade
the
field
of
admiralty.
so
all
jensen
said
was
that
there
is
a
limitation
on
the
state,
not
to
legislate
in
this
field.
it
did
not
indicate
that
the
federal
government
had
no
authority
to
legislate
in
this
field
even
if
there
may
have
been
today
an
overlapping
with
reference
to
pier
injuries.
and
respecting
the
cases
mentioned
about
pier
injuries,
the
jensen
decision
has
been
termed
an
ill
starred
one.
some
commentators
have
felt
that
the
court
had
some
qualms
of
conscience
after
deciding
this
case
and
depriving
the
widow
of
any
compensation.
subsequently,
in
every
case
which
came
before
this
body,
when
there
was
an
award
in
favor
of
the
injured
man
or
his
widow
and
dependents,
this
court
upheld
it.
mr.
justice
black
devised
this
twilight
zone.
we
also
have
the
local
but
maritime.
the
court
sought
devices
to
get
around
that
so
we
don't
feel
that
the
holding
that
injuries
on
piers
have
been
recognized
as
state
convincible
have
any
real
bearing
because
they
do
not
denude
or
do
not
deprive
this
court
of
its
right
to
legislate
in
a
feel
which
peculiarly
is
its
own.
with
reference
to
the
legislative
history,
an
excerpt
was
given
from
one
of
the
reports.
if
you
review
the
legislative
history
in
detail,
you
will
note
that
everyone
connected
with
this
particular
problem
was
interested
in
obtaining
full
coverage.
the
government
representative,
the
man
from
the
u.s.
department
of
labor
statistics
said
he
wanted
the
job
covered,
not
the
man
when
he
was
on
a
particular
position.
the
representatives
of
the
ile,
the
union
involved
here,
similarly
said
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
where
he
performs
his
duties
whether
it's
on
the
ship
or
on
the
pier.
the
union
wanted
them—all
the
men
protected.
similarly,
industry,
one
of
the
more
protected.
gentlemen,
i
see
that
my
time
has
run
out.
i
urge
that
the
decision
of
the
lower
court
be
affirmed
on
the
basis
of
the
arguments
advanced
here
and
what
is
contained
in
our
briefs
and
also
in
the
opinion
of
former
chief
justice
sobeloff.
