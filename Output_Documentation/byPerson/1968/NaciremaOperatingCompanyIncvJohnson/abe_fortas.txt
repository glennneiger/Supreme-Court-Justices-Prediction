a
man
on
a

two
men
working
on
the

a
crane,

there's
a
ship
here
and
there's
a
crane
on

a
line
coming

crane,
two
men
working
on
the
pier
in
my
hypothetical
situation.
justice

was
just
knocked

to
the
floor
of
the
pier
and
he
sustains
injuries,
he's
not
covered.
his
fellow
worker
is
knocked
off
the
pier
and
into
the
water
and
that
being
navigable
water,
he
is
covered,
is
that
about
it?

that
make
any
difference?
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
we
don't
have
that
case
here.
but
it's
just
the
fact
that
it's
above
the
water
and
not
on
it
that
makes
a
--
justice
abe
fortas
what

justice

fortas
it
says

providing
a
compensation
shall
be
payable

respect
of
disability
or
death
if
the
injury
occurred
on
navigable
waters.
justice

if
recovery
for

validly
be
provided
by

law.”
justice

do
you

that's
the

study
and
not
elaboration.
