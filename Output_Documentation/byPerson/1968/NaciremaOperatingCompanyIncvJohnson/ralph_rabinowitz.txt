mr.
ralph
rabinowitz
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
--
mr.
ralph
rabinowitz
--
ralph
rabinowitz
from
norfolk,
virginia
and
i
represent
longshoreman
albert
avery
who
has
been
attempting
to
get
compensation
under
this
act
since
1961.
i
take
it
the
question
before
the
court
is,
did
not
congress
whose
dominant
purpose
was
to
help
longshoremen
intended
the
longshoreman's
compensation
act
to
cover
injuries
caused
by
ship's
gear
to
a
longshoreman
in
the
ship's
gang
working
the
ship
from
a
pier
built
upon
freely
flowing
navigable
waters.
going
right
to
calbeck,
the
solicitor
general
would
have
us
disregard
what
he
calls
broad
language.
the
court
was
construing
the
very
coverage
language
that
we
are
involved
here
today
with
903
of
the
act.
and
the
court
said
in
calbeck,
“our
conclusion
is
that
congress
invoked
its
constitutional
power
so
as
to
provide
compensation
for
all
injuries
sustained
by
employees
on
navigable
waters
whether
or
not
a
particular
injury
might
also
have
been
within
the
constitutional
reach
of
a
state
workman's
compensation
law.”
mr.
ralph
rabinowitz
yes,
your
honor,
and
this
injury
was
upon
the
navigable
waters.
this
injury
was
upon
the
navigable
waters
both
factually
and
legally.
now
going
right
to
the
question
that
was
asked
about
jensen,
which
i
think
the
court
has
asked.
jensen
was
a
case
that
said
“state
compensation
commissions
you
can't
touch
these
people
because
this
is
an
admiralty
matter.”
after
that
the
states
over
reacted
to
jensen.
for
example,
the
best
illustration
of
that
is
a
case
called
anderson
against
johnson
lighterage
company,
120
new
york
55.
that's
a
case
where
a
longshoreman
on
the
dock,
he
was
on
the
dock
and
he
slipped
down
on
the
dock.
and
it
was
in
1918
which
is
right
after
jensen
in
1917.
now,
the
new
york
people
wanted
to
give
this
fellow
compensation.
it
went
up
through
the
courts,
through
the
court
of
appeals
of
new
york,
which
included
cardoso,
and
reading
jensen
the
said
“we
can't
give
this
fellow
compensation,
why?
because
in
jensen
the
court
had
said
the
work
of
a
stevedore
is
maritime
in
nature
and
his
employment
was
a
maritime
contract.
injuries
which
he
received
were
likewise
maritime
and
the
rights
and
liabilities
of
the
parties
in
connection
therewith
were
matters
clearly
within
the
admiralty
jurisdiction”
and
so
even
the
fellow
on
the
dock
couldn't
get
compensation.
then
the
nordenholt
case
came
along
and
this
is
history
which
mr.
justice
brennan
went
through
in
the
calbeck
case
to
come
out
with
the
holding
in
calbeck,
which
is
very
important
to
this
court.
now
you
come
up
with
nordenholt.
now
in
nordenholt,
the
court
said
“well,
this
fellow
fell
down
from
a
bag
of
stock
of
pile
on
the
dock
and
there's
no
pertinent
federal
statute.”
and
they
started
the
local
concern
doctrine,
or
they
said
it's
a
bad
result,
let's
start
a
local
concern
doctrine.
let's
say
that
fellow
who
fell
on
the
dock
and
his
mother
won't
be
able
to
get
compensation,
he
was
killed
because
of
jensen.
if
we
say
that,
he
won't
get
compensation,
let's
start
the
local
concern
doctrine.
and
they
said
“there's
no
pertinent
federal
statute
and
the
--
that
result
will
not
do
material
prejudice
or
will
not
affect
materially
the
maritime
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states.”
and
so
they
started
the
local
concern
doctrine.
now
let's
go
back
to
poor
johnson,
poor
johnson
the
fellow
in
new
york.
after
the
nordenholt
case
came
out
he
said
“i
fell
on
the
dock
too.”
he
went
back
and
asked
for
a
rehearing
and
the
new
york
courts
said
“no,
no,
no
we
don't
care
about
nordenholt.
we
still
think
jensen
doesn't
let
you
get
compensation
because
you
are
fulfilling
a
maritime
contract.
you
are
a
stevedore.”
and
citing
imbrovek,
which
i
never
can
pronounce,
i
don't
know
if
that's
quite
correct.
but
the
court
in
jensen
said
citing
imbrovek
that
“this
is
a
maritime
matter.”
this
is
exclusively
within
the
cognizance
of
maritime
matters.
the
constitution
article
iii
section
2
gives
these
powers
to
admiralty
which
is
a
federal
domain,
area
of
federal
conference.
now
this
is
what
the
court
meant
i
believe
in
calbeck.
when
mr.
justice
brennan
said
at
37120
“there
emerges
from
a
complete
legislative
history
a
congressional
desire
for
a
statute
which
would
provide
compensation
for
all
injuries
to
employees
on
navigable
waters;
in
every
case
that
is
where
a
jensen
might
have
seen
to
preclude
state
compensation.”
i
think
that's
important.
remember
poor
johnson
here
on
the
dock.
the
new
york
court
saying
“you
can't
get
compensation”
because
johnson
said
it
appear
to
us
that
you
can't
get
compensation
because
of
jensen.
so
i
think
that's
what
the
court's
were
talking
about
and
that's
what
mr.
justice
brennan,
so
precisely
set
out
in
calbeck.
and
that's
why
he
said
“we
can't
allow
this
area
of
federal
domain
to
be
--
to
depend
on
whether
or
not
a
state
act
applies
or
not,
we
can't
let
that
happen,
this
is
a
longshoreman's
act.”
and
that's
precisely
what
he
said.
and
that's
why
it
is
important
to
remember
that
calbeck
said
“it
is
sufficient
to
say
that
congress
intended
the
compensation
act
to
have
a
coverage
coextensive
with
the
limits
of
its
authority.”
excuse
me
your
honor,
justice
black?
mr.
ralph
rabinowitz
limits
of
its
authority,
limits
of
its
authority.
and
its
authority
is
the
admiralty
in
maritime
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states,
if
your
honor
please.
and
the
extension
act,
going
to
that
question,
the
extension
act.
the
extension
act
only
cleared
up
a
fuzzy
area.
it's
been
applied
retroactively,
it's
been
applied
retroactively.
mr.
justice
hand
in
the
second
circuit
had
held
in
the
strika
case
that
dock
side
injuries
were
within
maritime
competence
without
benefit,
without
benefit
of
the
admiralty
extension
act.
and
i
believe
it's
clear
that
you
just
cleared
up
an
area
that
was
fuzzy.
now
the
basis
of
the
act
--
mr.
ralph
rabinowitz
admiralty
tort
jurisdiction,
they
were
old
cases
that
said
that.
yes
your
honor,
they
were
old
cases
that
said,
pre-1927
cases
that
said
that
they
were
not
within
the
admiralty
tort
jurisdiction.
mr.
ralph
rabinowitz
there
were
cases,
pre-1927
cases
that
said
that.
mr.
ralph
rabinowitz
well
the
strika
case
did
and
that
was
before
the
extension
act.
strika
was
a
longshoreman
who
was
injured
in
the
dock,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
ralph
rabinowitz
yes
sir.
he
is
hurt
by
something
falling
from
the
vessel
or
either
swinging
low
or
something
like
that.
mr.
ralph
rabinowitz
justice
learned
hand.
strika
against
netherlands
ministry
185
f.2d
555,
second
circuit.
mr.
ralph
rabinowitz
there
were
cases
in
this
court
that
pre-1927
cases
did
not
--
that
said
docks
--
mr.
ralph
rabinowitz
strika
got
around
them.
i
don't
remember
how
judge,
but
to
be
precise
and
correct
to
tell
your
honor,
i
direct
myself
to
this
court.
it
would
not
--
if
he
expressly
--
mr.
ralph
rabinowitz
obviously.
mr.
ralph
rabinowitz
i
think
it
was
passed
and
this
is
just
to
surmise.
it's
not
based
on
a
study
of
the
history
that
--
mr.
ralph
rabinowitz
yes
sir.
going
on
to
the
argument,
it
is
clear
that
calbeck
expressly
repudiated
a
determination
on
the
basis
of
the
line
of
demarcation.
and
this
is
quoting
from
calbeck
again.
“a
line
of
demarcation
as
a
static
point
fixed
at
pre-1927
constitutional
decisions.”
the
court
in
calbeck
holds
if
there
are
areas
where
the
states
may
act
or
may
not
act.
but
this
has
not
effect
on
whether
federal
compensation
applies.
there's
nothing
in
the
history
--
i
have
read
the
legislative
history
of
the
longshoreman's
act,
and
the
--
it's
one
time
when
the
employer's
and
the
employee's
representatives
were
together.
they
all
wanted
a
broad
act,
and
there's
nothing
in
that
act
or
the
legislative
history
which
shows
anything
but
a
congressional
interest
in
covering
workers
in
maritime
employment
injured
as
these
fellows
were
right
beside
the
ship,
working
the
ship,
they
could've
gone
aboard
the
ship
if
their
employer
had
said
“go
aboard
the
ship”
that
morning
they
would've
been
aboard
the
ship.
if
one
of
their
fellows
had
said
“i
want
to
switch
places
with
you
today”
they
would've
been
aboard
the
ship.
there's
no
difference
in
the
hazards
or
the
work
they
do.
going
now
to
and
closing
as
i
see
my
time
is
close
to
ending.
sir?
mr.
ralph
rabinowitz
has
it
ended?
may
i
say
one
last
thing
judge
and
i
will
close
with
that
if
you
--
mr.
chief
justice?
i
say
to
this
court
in
conclusion
that
this
case
could
be
affirmed
and
should
be
affirmed.
it
could
be
affirmed
on
a
very
narrow
ground,
and
that
is
that
all
these
fellows,
all
these
longshoreman,
remember
this
is
an
act
called
the
longshoreman's
act
passed
for
the
benefit
of
longshoremen,
were
injured
by
ship's
gear
while
serving
the
ships.
and
they
were
on
areas.
they
were
on
areas
that
were
constructed
over
the
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states,
as
simple
as
that.
and
i
respectfully
suggest
to
the
court
that
that
is
the
proper
result.
and
i
respectfully
pray
that
the
court
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
en
banc
court
of
the
fourth
circuit.
mr.
ralph
rabinowitz
it's
mr.
rabinowitz,
we
switched
around
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
ralph
rabinowitz
mr.
chief
justice
if
it
please
the
court.
ralph
rabinowitz
and
i
represent
longshoreman
albert
avery.
simply
this
case
deals
with
question
of
whether
congress
meant
to
cover
a
longshoreman
working
issue
from
a
dock
when
he
was
injured
by
ship's
gear.
did
congress
fully
exercise
its
power?
its
subject
matter
power
over
this
area,
that
is
the
central
question
here
and
i
take
it
that
this
question
was
answered
in
the
calbeck
case
when
this
court
was
treating
the
very
section
the
act
that
we
deal
with
today
and
the
court
said
this,
“the
elaborate
provisions
the
act,
reviewed
in
the
light
of
prior
congressional
legislation
as
interpreted
by
the
supreme
court
leaves
no
room
for
doubt
as
it
appears
to
us
that
congress
intended
to
exercise
to
the
fullest
extent
all
the
power
and
jurisdiction
it
had
over
the
subject
matter.”
it
is
sufficient
to
say
that
congress
intended
the
compensation
act
to
have
a
coverage
co-extensive
with
the
limits
of
its
authority.
mr.
ralph
rabinowitz
yes,
your
honor.
i
would.
mr.
ralph
rabinowitz
no,
the
holding,
i
don't
have
the
have
to
say
the
holding
below
of
course
is
grounded
on
mainly
two,
it's
an
altered
holding,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
ralph
rabinowitz
calbeck
statement
supports
this,
the
subject
matter
of
power,
going
back
to
jensen,
if
your
honor
please.
the
reason
that
jensen
did
not
allow
state
act
to
apply
its
compensation
to
a
longshoreman
was
because
the
state
act
was
construed
to
deal
with
an
area
which
was
exclusively
of
federal
confidence
and
the
court
said
this
in
jensen,
the
work
of
a
stevedore
is
maritime
in
its
nature
and
his
employment
was
a
maritime
contract.
the
rights
and
liabilities
of
the
parties
in
connection
there
worked
where
it
matters
clearly
within
the
admiralty
jurisdiction.
so,
going
to
the
first
holding
of
the
fourth
circuit
below,
this
is
a
matter
that
is
exclusively
of
federal
confidence
under
the
constitution
and
jensen
said
state
compensation
acts
cannot
apply
because
of
that,
because
of
the
character
of
the
longshoreman's
employment.
and
so
this
meshes
bringing
it
up
to
date
with
what
was
said
in
calbeck.
if
this
is
an
area
of
federal
confidence
and
congress
meant
to
exercise
its
full
power
over
that
area,
the
character
of
the
employment.
now,
the
second
holding
or
the
alternate
holding
below,
mr.
justice
white
was
the
admiralty
extension
act
argument
and
we
know
that
the
admiralty
extension
act
was
a
valid
exercise
of
congressional
power.
and
we
know
that
both
the
longshoreman's
act,
if
your
honors
please,
and
the
admiralty
extension
act
both
speak
in
identical
terms,
one
says
upon
the
navigable
waters,
the
other
says
on
navigable
waters.
mr.
ralph
rabinowitz
there
are
pre-1927
cases
that
say
that.
mr.
ralph
rabinowitz
they
are
announcement
of
limits
of
the
admiralty
tort
jurisdiction,
that
contract,
not
status,
not
the
character
of
employment,
pre-1927
but
in
calbeck,
if
your
honor
please,
mr.
justice
brennan
said
expressly,
“we
do
not
think
the
act
should
be
construed
on
the
basis
of
pre-1927,
admiralty
tort
cases
which
were
restrictive,
which
did
not
cover
dock
side
injuries”
of
your
honor
please.
however—
mr.
ralph
rabinowitz
that's
correct,
that's
correct.
mr.
ralph
rabinowitz
yes,
sir.
mr.
ralph
rabinowitz
if
you
take
your
statement
to
me,
just
admiralty
tort
jurisdiction,
yes
your
honor.
but
if
you
mean
that
as
we
all
know,
admiralty
jurisdiction
is
not
just
tort
based,
it's
status
based
or
contract
based
or
as
jensen
said,
character
of
employment
based
and
that's
what
congress
wanted
to
feel
the
void
with.
jensen
had
said
to
the
state
act
“don't
touch
this
area
because
these
are
longshoreman,
the
character
of
their
employment.”
the
employment
relationship
is
such
that
they
cannot
be
made
to
come
under
an
area
of
exclusive
federal
confidence.
now,
when
--
mr.
ralph
rabinowitz
yes,
sir.
on
the
first
holding
of
the
fourth
circuit
below,
i
will
do
it
at
least
since
the
admiralty
extension
act
has
--
mr.
ralph
rabinowitz
i
would
say
this,
the
day
after
the
act
was
passed,
i
would
say
this
if
your
honor
please,
jensen
kept
longshoreman
from
recovering
under
state
acts,
why?
because
they
said
we
cannot
touch
this
area,
the
character
of
their
employment,
the
contract,
it
is
a
maritime
contract
which
cannot
be
touched.
it
is
an
area
of
exclusive
federal
confidence.
the
act
in
1927
was
passed
to
cover
these
men
that
the
state
acts
were
kept
from
helping.
and
congress
had
tried
two
times
to
make
a
state
act.
do
this
and
the
court
had
struck
that
down
in
1927.
the
court
came
along
and
filled
this
of
it.
congress
came
along
and
filled
this
void.
mr.
ralph
rabinowitz
yes,
your
honor,
there
was.
in
the
case
called,
for
example,
there
is
certainly
a
void
on
the
appeal.
in
the
case
called
johnson.
if
your
honor
please,
excuse
me
for
coming
but
i'll
find
the

in
a
moment.

mr.

rabinowitz
sir?
mr.
ralph
rabinowitz
some
did
but
there
was
this
area
where
nobody
knew
much
what
was
happening,
if
your
honor
please
and
this
was
what
congress
was
trying
to

it

in
the
davis
case,
mr.
justice
black
recognize
this
and
quoted
from
jensen,
he
said
this,
quoting
jensen,
jensen
had
said
“when
a
state
could
and
when
it
could
not
grant
protection
under
a
compensation
act
was
left
as
a
perplexing
problem
for
it
was
held
difficult,
if
not
impossible
to
define
this
boundary
with
exactness.”
that's
quoted
exactly
from
jensen
and
mr.
justice
black
in
davis
re-quoted
that
and
said
“there
isn't
even
a
firm
line
when
the
state
act
could
apply
and
so
the
twilight
zone
document
was
started.”
even
before
the
admiralty
extension
act
in
the
o'donnell
case,
this
court
extended
the
jones
act
for
seamen
at
shore.
and
look
at
the
language
of
this
court
when
it's
juxtaposed
with
the
language
of
this
court
in
calbeck,
identical,
almost
identical
language.
in
o'donnell,
the
court
said,
and
this
is
before
the
admiralty
extension
act.
congress,
in
the
absence
of
any
indication
of
a
different
purpose
must
be
taken
to
have
intended
to
make
them
applicable
so
far
as
the
words
and
the
constitution
permit
and
to
have
given
to
them
the
full
support
of
all
the
constitutional
power
it
possessed.
hence,
the
act
allows
the
recovery
sought
unless
the
constitution
forbids
it.
if
you
just
juxtapose
that
language
with
the
language
of
this
court
in
calbeck,
it's
almost
identical
language.
mr.
ralph
rabinowitz
yes,
your
honor
and
--
they're
in
the
course
of
their
employment.
mr.
ralph
rabinowitz
in
some
cases,
there
would
be
a
duplication,
but
in
calbeck,
mr.
justice
brennan
said
that
he
didn't
--
he
said
there's
no
mutually
exclusive
area
here.
state
compensation
doesn't
preclude
federal
compensation,
it's
not
usually
exclusive
if
your
honor
please.
there
isn't
--
there
can
be
an
area
of
overlapping
jurisdiction.
however,
you
cannot
allow
federal
confidence
to
be
ruled
by
whether
or
not
a
state
acts,
whether
or
not
a
state
acts.
let
us
say
--
mr.
ralph
rabinowitz
no,
sir.
it
intended
to
fill
a
void
which
jensen
had
mainly
started
by
precluding
state
compensation
from
longshoreman
because
of
the
character
of
their
employment,
maritime
contract
and
if
your
honor
please,
this
is
clear
from
the
legislative
history.
in
the
senate
report,
particularly,
it
stated
just
like
that,
it
stated
in
these
terms,
if
your
honor
please
the
report
in
calbeck
--
if
i
can
find
it
in
just
a
moment.
the
act
is
construed.
the
legislative
history
is
construed
just
like
this
in
the
senate
report.
mr.
ralph
rabinowitz
i'm
looking
at
my
brief
on
page
24,
if
your
honor
please,
which
is
a
blue
brief
which
is
quoting
from
mr.
justice
sovalloff's
review
of
the
legislative
history.
page
24
from
the
senate
report
on
the
bottom
of
the
page
starting
with
the
indented
paragraph,
this
is
from
the
senate
report.
if
longshoreman
could
avail
themselves
of
the
benefit
of
state
compensation
laws,
there
would
be
no
occasion
for
this
legislation
but
unfortunately,
they
are
excluded
from
these
laws
by
reason
of
the
character
of
their
employment
and
they
are
not
only
excluded
but
the
supreme
court
has
more
than
once
held
that
federal
legislation
cannot
constitutionally
be
enacted
that
will
apply
state
laws
at
this
occupation.
and
there
congress
recognized
what
the
court
had
done
in
jensen.
it
had
said
because
of
the
character
of
the
longshoreman's
employment,
this
is
an
area
of
federal
confidence.
in
jensen
the
court
was
worried
about
lack
of
uniformity,
long
shoring
having
to
do
with
the
ships
that
go
from
port
to
port
and
they
said
this
is
an
area
of
federal
confidence.
going
on
to
just
the
realities
of
this
case,
we
have
the
very
simple
facts
that
this
ship
caused
the
injuries
here
and
the
case
could
go
off
on
those
facts
alone
but
i
suggest
that
the
court
should
construe
the
act
in
a
way
that
i
have
suggested
in
which
congress
mentioned.
congress,
if
you
read
the
debates
for
once,
you
find
that
the
employers
and
the
employee's
representatives
were
unanimous
in
wanting
a
broad
act.
they
wanted
an
act
that
would
cover
all
the
men,
all
the
longshoremen
in
the
course
of
their
employment.they
didn't
want
an
act
that
would
be
here
a
bit
there
a
bit.
and
it's
not
so
strange
to
cover
the
dock
in
the
course
of
maritime
employment.
when
a
ship
comes
into
a
dock,
a
ship
has
always
been
held
to
assert
thereby
a
possessory
character
over
the
dock.
way
back
in
ex
parte
eastern,
95
u.s.
68,
this
court
held
that
mortgage
had
to
be
paid.
but
the
ship
actually
started
to
have
a
proprietary
right
over
the
pier
when
it
tied
up
to
load
and
unload.
the
court
said
this,
access
to
the
ship
or
vessel
rightfully
occupying
a
birth
at
a
wharf
for
the
purposes
of
loading
and
unloading
is
the
undoubted
right
of
the
owner
or
charterer
of
such
a
ship
or
vessel
for
which
such
right
has
been
secured.
in
other
words,
the
character
of
that
right
is
a
possessory
right
of
the
ship
and
the
ship
caused
the
injuries
in
this
case.
now,
there
has
been
some
comment
about
whether
a
third
party
action
has
been
filed
in
certain
cases.
in
avery's
case,
no
third
party
action,
no
tort
action
has
been
filed.
avery
wants
his
federal
compensation.
he
was
hurt
in
1961.
he's
yet
to
get
it.
he's
a
longshoreman.
the
act
is
called
the
longshoreman's
act.
the
legislative
history
says
we
are
passing
this
act
to
give
the
longshoreman
the
benefit
of
compensation
and
i
suggest
to
this
court
that
there
is
no
common
sense
reason
and
no
reason
in
the
legislative
history
or
in
the
development
of
the
cases
in
this
court
to
keep
these
longshoremen
who
are
hurt
by
the
ship
because
they
happen
to
be
standing
on
the
dock
from
getting
federal
compensation
as
congress
intended.
the
petitioners
would
rely
strongly
on
swanson
against
marra
brothers.
swanson
was
not
a
case
under
the
longshoreman's
act,
simple
as
that.
it
was
not
a
case
in
this
court
where
the
man
had
asked
for
longshoreman's
act
benefits.
he
had
sued
the
ship
under
the
jones
act
and
he
had
not
sued
his
employer.
now,
the
jones
act
requires
you
to
sue
your
employer
and
that's
all
that
that
case
was
about,
simple
as
that.
this
case
today
is
ruled
by
calbeck.
the
language
in
calbeck
is
clear,
statements
are
not
hard
to
understand,
they
are
as
follows,
in
some
it
appears
that
the
longshoreman's
act
was
designed
to
ensure
that
a
compensation
readily
existed
for
all
injuries
sustained
by
employees
on
navigable
waters
and
to
avoid
uncertainty
as
to
the
source,
state
or
federal
of
that
remedy,
section
3
(a)
should
then
be
construed
to
achieve
those
purposes.
plainly,
the
court
of
appeals
interpretation
fixing
the
boundaries
of
federal
compensation
or
federal
coverage
where
the
outer
limits
of
state
confidence
had
been
left
by
pre-1927
constitutional
decisions
does
not
achieve
them.
there's
the
court
expressly
says
you
cannot
fix
the
boundaries
of
federal
conference
on
a
basis
of
pre-1927
constitutional
decisions,
again,
the
court
says
the
line
of
demarcation
is
not
a
static
one
fixed
by
pre-1927
constitutional
decisions.
again,
reiterating
what
the
court
said
in
calbeck,
congress
intended
to
exercise
to
the
fullest
extent
all
the
power
and
jurisdiction
it
had
over
the
subject
matter.
in
the
application
of
the
act
therefore,
the
brawl
of
his
ground,
it
permits
you
to
take
it.
why
didn't
the
court,
why
didn't
congress
include
docks
when
it
said
dry
docks
and
that's
simple.
dry
docks
are
in
the
main
on
dry
land,
they
were
then
they
are
now,
just
about
all
dry
docks
are
built
on
dry
land,
there
wasn't
any
reason
to
include
docks.
the
reason
they
had
to
put
dry
docks
on
there
as
an
express
addendum
was
because
they
were
built
on
dry
land
and
this
is
recognized
by
judge
palmerri
in
a
district
court
case,
the
arrien
case,
when
he
said
congress
obviously
expected
docks
to
be
covered
by
the
words
upon
navigable
waters
but
fear
that
dry
docks
might
be
held
by
the
courts
to
be
without
the
act.
and
therefore
felt
it
advisable
to
expressly
mention
the
latter.
mr.
ralph
rabinowitz
the
dry
dock
is
almost
always
on
land,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
ralph
rabinowitz
well,
they
have
a
pumping.
i'm
not
an
expert
on
dry
docks,
if
your
honor
please
but
once
i've
seen
the
new
panu
shipyard
--
mr.
ralph
rabinowitz
if
your
honor
please,
the
dry
docks
i've
seen
at
the
new
panu
shipyard
all
built
on
dry
land
but
there
might
be
some,
there
might
be
some
that
are
on
water,
they
have
some
that
pump
water
in
and
out.
i've
seen
that
but
most
of
the
ones
i've
seen
have
been
on
dry
land.
my
experience
however
has
been
confined
to
the
virginia
area.
now,
the
rodriguez
case--
mr.
ralph
rabinowitz
yes,
your
honor.
it
would.
mr.
ralph
rabinowitz
if
your
honor
please,
they
wanted
to
be
sure,
they
just
wanted
to
be
sure.
rodriguez
has
nothing
--
mr.
ralph
rabinowitz
not
really,
it's
a
different
--
mr.
ralph
rabinowitz
i
would
say
so,
yes
your
honor,
it's
a
different
angle.
one
is
having
to
do
with
ship
repair
and
construction,
the
other
has
to
do
with
the
live
vessel
loading
and
unloading.
if
your
honor
please,
the
rodriguez
case
has
nothing
to
do
that
i
can
see
with
this
case,
does
not
deal
with
the
longshore
act.
it
is
a
case
having
to
do
with
the
interaction
of
two
other
acts,
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
and
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act.
the
court
recognizes
that
admiralty
jurisdiction
would
obtain
if
a
vessel
caused
injury
as
was
the
case
here,
a
vessel
caused
injury
here.
the
court
expressly
recognize
in
rodrigue
if
a
vessel
causes
injury,
admiralty
jurisdiction
obtains.
the
most
important
case,
this
calbeck
and
i
say
calbeck
rules
in
the
instant
area.
nordenholt
began,
nordenholt
is
a
case,
it's
a
relic
before
congress
acted.
it's
a
relic
before
congress
action.
it
acted
where
the
supreme
court
stated
expressly
that
our
result
is
depending
upon
the
fact
that
there
is
no
pertinent
federal
statute,
there
is
no
pertinent
federal
statute
and
so
the
question
is,
are
we
going
to
let
this
widow
recover
before
the
federal
act
or
are
we
not
let
her
recover
because
jensen
had
said
he's
a
longshoreman
and
the
character
of
his
employment
keeps
us
from
helping
him,
under
the
state
act.
are
we
going
to
start
something,
are
we
going
to
retrogress
from
what
we
said
in
jensen
and
start
a
local
concern
document,
a
doctrine
which
was
a
beneficent
doctrine
to
let
the
state
act
go
ahead
and
give
the
widow
the
compensation.
with
the
addendum
that,
remember
there's
no
federal
statute,
with
sort
of
the
court
asking
congress,
get
on
the
stick,
come
on,
let's
pass
and
act
for
these
longshoremen.
nordenholt
in
1922
and
congress
responding
thereafter.
similarly,
t.
smith
&
son
which
is
relied
upon
by
the
petitioners.
again,
a
pre-1927
case,
well
perhaps
it
is
a
1928
however
the
death
occurred
in
1925
and
this
is
what
the
arrien
court
in
the
second
circuit
said
about
t.
smith
&
son.
the
court
simply
held
the
application
of
a
state
compensation
statute,
did
not
impose
approached
upon
admiralty
jurisdiction.
mr.
butler
--
mr.
justice
butler
and
understandably
did
not
mention
the
longshoreman's
act
for
the
federal
remedy
was
not
yet
effective.
finally,
i
say
to
this
court
that
the
holding
could
be
grounded
on
either
of
the
two
bases
at
the
fourth
circuit,
judge
sobeloff's
opinion
for
his
ground.
one,
the
character
of
the
employment
is
such
that
congress
meant
to
cover
these
injuries
and
jensen
had
precluded
state
compensation
in
this
area,
congress
dealt
with
this
area
and
used
the
full
power
at
hand.
or
secondly
or
alternatively
the
court
could
go
off
on
the
holding
on
the
basis
of
the
admiralty
extension
act.
the
admiralty
extension
act
says
in
its
legislative
history,
senate
report
number
1593,
second
section
pages
one
and
two.
for
example,
if
a
bridge
or
a
pier
or
any
person
or
property
situated
thereon
is
injured
by
a
vessel,
the
admiralty
courts
of
the
united
states
do
not
entertain
the
claim
for
damages
thus
caused,
this
was
before.
the
bill
under
consideration
would
provide
for
the
exercise
of
admiralty
in
maritime
jurisdiction
in
all
cases,
all
cases
in
the
type
of
i've
indicated.
now
it's
been
said
and
argued
that
the
longshore
act
wasn't
mentioned
in
this
act,
neither
was
the
warranty
of
seaworthiness,
either
was
a
whole
range
of
acts
of
congress.
certainly
it
wasn't
mentioned
because
the
legislative
history
says
that
the
jurisdiction
is
covered
in
all
these
cases,
all
these
cases.
so,
why
would
congress
then
have
to
go
down
and
say
when
we
mean
all
cases,
we
mean
the
longshore
act,
the
bridge
act,
the
rivers
act,
the
this
act.
they
didn't
have
to
do
that
and
the
admiralty
extension
act
has
been
applied
in
various
and
sundry
ways
that
were
never
mentioned
expressly
by
congress
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
admiralty
extension
act.
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
simply
stated
calbeck
rules
that
the
fourth
circuit's
opinion
embank
should
be
affirmed
that
there
is
no
good
reason
in
the
legislative
history
or
in
the
common
sense
of
the
situation
to
exclude
the
very
men
who
were
meant
to
be
helped
by
congress
from
the
benefits
of
this
act.
there's
nothing
in
the
literal
language
that
excludes
the
injuries
herein.
there's
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
that
excludes
the
injuries
herein.
the
only
reason
that
congress
didn't
use
maritime
jurisdiction
rather
than
upon
navigable
waters
is
because
they
were
afraid
that
maritime
jurisdiction,
that
phrase
was
too
restricted.
they
wanted
the
most
comprehensive
phrase
they
could
find
and
this
is
clear
on
the
legislative
history.
so,
i
respectfully
suggest
and
pray
that
this
court
affirm
the
decision
of
the
fourth
circuit
court
of
appeals
embank.
mr.
ralph
rabinowitz
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
--
mr.
ralph
rabinowitz
--
ralph
rabinowitz
from
norfolk,
virginia
and
i
represent
longshoreman
albert
avery
who
has
been
attempting
to
get
compensation
under
this
act
since
1961.
i
take
it
the
question
before
the
court
is,
did
not
congress
whose
dominant
purpose
was
to
help
longshoremen
intended
the
longshoreman's
compensation
act
to
cover
injuries
caused
by
ship's
gear
to
a
longshoreman
in
the
ship's
gang
working
the
ship
from
a
pier
built
upon
freely
flowing
navigable
waters.
going
right
to
calbeck,
the
solicitor
general
would
have
us
disregard
what
he
calls
broad
language.
the
court
was
construing
the
very
coverage
language
that
we
are
involved
here
today
with
903
of
the
act.
and
the
court
said
in
calbeck,
“our
conclusion
is
that
congress
invoked
its
constitutional
power
so
as
to
provide
compensation
for
all
injuries
sustained
by
employees
on
navigable
waters
whether
or
not
a
particular
injury
might
also
have
been
within
the
constitutional
reach
of
a
state
workman's
compensation
law.”
mr.
ralph
rabinowitz
yes,
your
honor,
and
this
injury
was
upon
the
navigable
waters.
this
injury
was
upon
the
navigable
waters
both
factually
and
legally.
now
going
right
to
the
question
that
was
asked
about
jensen,
which
i
think
the
court
has
asked.
jensen
was
a
case
that
said
“state
compensation
commissions
you
can't
touch
these
people
because
this
is
an
admiralty
matter.”
after
that
the
states
over
reacted
to
jensen.
for
example,
the
best
illustration
of
that
is
a
case
called
anderson
against
johnson
lighterage
company,
120
new
york
55.
that's
a
case
where
a
longshoreman
on
the
dock,
he
was
on
the
dock
and
he
slipped
down
on
the
dock.
and
it
was
in
1918
which
is
right
after
jensen
in
1917.
now,
the
new
york
people
wanted
to
give
this
fellow
compensation.
it
went
up
through
the
courts,
through
the
court
of
appeals
of
new
york,
which
included
cardoso,
and
reading
jensen
the
said
“we
can't
give
this
fellow
compensation,
why?
because
in
jensen
the
court
had
said
the
work
of
a
stevedore
is
maritime
in
nature
and
his
employment
was
a
maritime
contract.
injuries
which
he
received
were
likewise
maritime
and
the
rights
and
liabilities
of
the
parties
in
connection
therewith
were
matters
clearly
within
the
admiralty
jurisdiction”
and
so
even
the
fellow
on
the
dock
couldn't
get
compensation.
then
the
nordenholt
case
came
along
and
this
is
history
which
mr.
justice
brennan
went
through
in
the
calbeck
case
to
come
out
with
the
holding
in
calbeck,
which
is
very
important
to
this
court.
now
you
come
up
with
nordenholt.
now
in
nordenholt,
the
court
said
“well,
this
fellow
fell
down
from
a
bag
of
stock
of
pile
on
the
dock
and
there's
no
pertinent
federal
statute.”
and
they
started
the
local
concern
doctrine,
or
they
said
it's
a
bad
result,
let's
start
a
local
concern
doctrine.
let's
say
that
fellow
who
fell
on
the
dock
and
his
mother
won't
be
able
to
get
compensation,
he
was
killed
because
of
jensen.
if
we
say
that,
he
won't
get
compensation,
let's
start
the
local
concern
doctrine.
and
they
said
“there's
no
pertinent
federal
statute
and
the
--
that
result
will
not
do
material
prejudice
or
will
not
affect
materially
the
maritime
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states.”
and
so
they
started
the
local
concern
doctrine.
now
let's
go
back
to
poor
johnson,
poor
johnson
the
fellow
in
new
york.
after
the
nordenholt
case
came
out
he
said
“i
fell
on
the
dock
too.”
he
went
back
and
asked
for
a
rehearing
and
the
new
york
courts
said
“no,
no,
no
we
don't
care
about
nordenholt.
we
still
think
jensen
doesn't
let
you
get
compensation
because
you
are
fulfilling
a
maritime
contract.
you
are
a
stevedore.”
and
citing
imbrovek,
which
i
never
can
pronounce,
i
don't
know
if
that's
quite
correct.
but
the
court
in
jensen
said
citing
imbrovek
that
“this
is
a
maritime
matter.”
this
is
exclusively
within
the
cognizance
of
maritime
matters.
the
constitution
article
iii
section
2
gives
these
powers
to
admiralty
which
is
a
federal
domain,
area
of
federal
conference.
now
this
is
what
the
court
meant
i
believe
in
calbeck.
when
mr.
justice
brennan
said
at
37120
“there
emerges
from
a
complete
legislative
history
a
congressional
desire
for
a
statute
which
would
provide
compensation
for
all
injuries
to
employees
on
navigable
waters;
in
every
case
that
is
where
a
jensen
might
have
seen
to
preclude
state
compensation.”
i
think
that's
important.
remember
poor
johnson
here
on
the
dock.
the
new
york
court
saying
“you
can't
get
compensation”
because
johnson
said
it
appear
to
us
that
you
can't
get
compensation
because
of
jensen.
so
i
think
that's
what
the
court's
were
talking
about
and
that's
what
mr.
justice
brennan,
so
precisely
set
out
in
calbeck.
and
that's
why
he
said
“we
can't
allow
this
area
of
federal
domain
to
be
--
to
depend
on
whether
or
not
a
state
act
applies
or
not,
we
can't
let
that
happen,
this
is
a
longshoreman's
act.”
and
that's
precisely
what
he
said.
and
that's
why
it
is
important
to
remember
that
calbeck
said
“it
is
sufficient
to
say
that
congress
intended
the
compensation
act
to
have
a
coverage
coextensive
with
the
limits
of
its
authority.”
excuse
me
your
honor,
justice
black?
mr.
ralph
rabinowitz
limits
of
its
authority,
limits
of
its
authority.
and
its
authority
is
the
admiralty
in
maritime
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states,
if
your
honor
please.
and
the
extension
act,
going
to
that
question,
the
extension
act.
the
extension
act
only
cleared
up
a
fuzzy
area.
it's
been
applied
retroactively,
it's
been
applied
retroactively.
mr.
justice
hand
in
the
second
circuit
had
held
in
the
strika
case
that
dock
side
injuries
were
within
maritime
competence
without
benefit,
without
benefit
of
the
admiralty
extension
act.
and
i
believe
it's
clear
that
you
just
cleared
up
an
area
that
was
fuzzy.
now
the
basis
of
the
act
--
mr.
ralph
rabinowitz
admiralty
tort
jurisdiction,
they
were
old
cases
that
said
that.
yes
your
honor,
they
were
old
cases
that
said,
pre-1927
cases
that
said
that
they
were
not
within
the
admiralty
tort
jurisdiction.
mr.
ralph
rabinowitz
there
were
cases,
pre-1927
cases
that
said
that.
mr.
ralph
rabinowitz
well
the
strika
case
did
and
that
was
before
the
extension
act.
strika
was
a
longshoreman
who
was
injured
in
the
dock,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
ralph
rabinowitz
yes
sir.
he
is
hurt
by
something
falling
from
the
vessel
or
either
swinging
low
or
something
like
that.
mr.
ralph
rabinowitz
justice
learned
hand.
strika
against
netherlands
ministry
185
f.2d
555,
second
circuit.
mr.
ralph
rabinowitz
there
were
cases
in
this
court
that
pre-1927
cases
did
not
--
that
said
docks
--
mr.
ralph
rabinowitz
strika
got
around
them.
i
don't
remember
how
judge,
but
to
be
precise
and
correct
to
tell
your
honor,
i
direct
myself
to
this
court.
it
would
not
--
if
he
expressly
--
mr.
ralph
rabinowitz
obviously.
mr.
ralph
rabinowitz
i
think
it
was
passed
and
this
is
just
to
surmise.
it's
not
based
on
a
study
of
the
history
that
--
mr.
ralph
rabinowitz
yes
sir.
going
on
to
the
argument,
it
is
clear
that
calbeck
expressly
repudiated
a
determination
on
the
basis
of
the
line
of
demarcation.
and
this
is
quoting
from
calbeck
again.
“a
line
of
demarcation
as
a
static
point
fixed
at
pre-1927
constitutional
decisions.”
the
court
in
calbeck
holds
if
there
are
areas
where
the
states
may
act
or
may
not
act.
but
this
has
not
effect
on
whether
federal
compensation
applies.
there's
nothing
in
the
history
--
i
have
read
the
legislative
history
of
the
longshoreman's
act,
and
the
--
it's
one
time
when
the
employer's
and
the
employee's
representatives
were
together.
they
all
wanted
a
broad
act,
and
there's
nothing
in
that
act
or
the
legislative
history
which
shows
anything
but
a
congressional
interest
in
covering
workers
in
maritime
employment
injured
as
these
fellows
were
right
beside
the
ship,
working
the
ship,
they
could've
gone
aboard
the
ship
if
their
employer
had
said
“go
aboard
the
ship”
that
morning
they
would've
been
aboard
the
ship.
if
one
of
their
fellows
had
said
“i
want
to
switch
places
with
you
today”
they
would've
been
aboard
the
ship.
there's
no
difference
in
the
hazards
or
the
work
they
do.
going
now
to
and
closing
as
i
see
my
time
is
close
to
ending.
sir?
mr.
ralph
rabinowitz
has
it
ended?
may
i
say
one
last
thing
judge
and
i
will
close
with
that
if
you
--
mr.
chief
justice?
i
say
to
this
court
in
conclusion
that
this
case
could
be
affirmed
and
should
be
affirmed.
it
could
be
affirmed
on
a
very
narrow
ground,
and
that
is
that
all
these
fellows,
all
these
longshoreman,
remember
this
is
an
act
called
the
longshoreman's
act
passed
for
the
benefit
of
longshoremen,
were
injured
by
ship's
gear
while
serving
the
ships.
and
they
were
on
areas.
they
were
on
areas
that
were
constructed
over
the
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states,
as
simple
as
that.
and
i
respectfully
suggest
to
the
court
that
that
is
the
proper
result.
and
i
respectfully
pray
that
the
court
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
en
banc
court
of
the
fourth
circuit.
mr.
ralph
rabinowitz
it's
mr.
rabinowitz,
we
switched
around
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
ralph
rabinowitz
mr.
chief
justice
if
it
please
the
court.
ralph
rabinowitz
and
i
represent
longshoreman
albert
avery.
simply
this
case
deals
with
question
of
whether
congress
meant
to
cover
a
longshoreman
working
issue
from
a
dock
when
he
was
injured
by
ship's
gear.
did
congress
fully
exercise
its
power?
its
subject
matter
power
over
this
area,
that
is
the
central
question
here
and
i
take
it
that
this
question
was
answered
in
the
calbeck
case
when
this
court
was
treating
the
very
section
the
act
that
we
deal
with
today
and
the
court
said
this,
“the
elaborate
provisions
the
act,
reviewed
in
the
light
of
prior
congressional
legislation
as
interpreted
by
the
supreme
court
leaves
no
room
for
doubt
as
it
appears
to
us
that
congress
intended
to
exercise
to
the
fullest
extent
all
the
power
and
jurisdiction
it
had
over
the
subject
matter.”
it
is
sufficient
to
say
that
congress
intended
the
compensation
act
to
have
a
coverage
co-extensive
with
the
limits
of
its
authority.
mr.
ralph
rabinowitz
yes,
your
honor.
i
would.
mr.
ralph
rabinowitz
no,
the
holding,
i
don't
have
the
have
to
say
the
holding
below
of
course
is
grounded
on
mainly
two,
it's
an
altered
holding,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
ralph
rabinowitz
calbeck
statement
supports
this,
the
subject
matter
of
power,
going
back
to
jensen,
if
your
honor
please.
the
reason
that
jensen
did
not
allow
state
act
to
apply
its
compensation
to
a
longshoreman
was
because
the
state
act
was
construed
to
deal
with
an
area
which
was
exclusively
of
federal
confidence
and
the
court
said
this
in
jensen,
the
work
of
a
stevedore
is
maritime
in
its
nature
and
his
employment
was
a
maritime
contract.
the
rights
and
liabilities
of
the
parties
in
connection
there
worked
where
it
matters
clearly
within
the
admiralty
jurisdiction.
so,
going
to
the
first
holding
of
the
fourth
circuit
below,
this
is
a
matter
that
is
exclusively
of
federal
confidence
under
the
constitution
and
jensen
said
state
compensation
acts
cannot
apply
because
of
that,
because
of
the
character
of
the
longshoreman's
employment.
and
so
this
meshes
bringing
it
up
to
date
with
what
was
said
in
calbeck.
if
this
is
an
area
of
federal
confidence
and
congress
meant
to
exercise
its
full
power
over
that
area,
the
character
of
the
employment.
now,
the
second
holding
or
the
alternate
holding
below,
mr.
justice
white
was
the
admiralty
extension
act
argument
and
we
know
that
the
admiralty
extension
act
was
a
valid
exercise
of
congressional
power.
and
we
know
that
both
the
longshoreman's
act,
if
your
honors
please,
and
the
admiralty
extension
act
both
speak
in
identical
terms,
one
says
upon
the
navigable
waters,
the
other
says
on
navigable
waters.
mr.
ralph
rabinowitz
there
are
pre-1927
cases
that
say
that.
mr.
ralph
rabinowitz
they
are
announcement
of
limits
of
the
admiralty
tort
jurisdiction,
that
contract,
not
status,
not
the
character
of
employment,
pre-1927
but
in
calbeck,
if
your
honor
please,
mr.
justice
brennan
said
expressly,
“we
do
not
think
the
act
should
be
construed
on
the
basis
of
pre-1927,
admiralty
tort
cases
which
were
restrictive,
which
did
not
cover
dock
side
injuries”
of
your
honor
please.
however—
mr.
ralph
rabinowitz
that's
correct,
that's
correct.
mr.
ralph
rabinowitz
yes,
sir.
mr.
ralph
rabinowitz
if
you
take
your
statement
to
me,
just
admiralty
tort
jurisdiction,
yes
your
honor.
but
if
you
mean
that
as
we
all
know,
admiralty
jurisdiction
is
not
just
tort
based,
it's
status
based
or
contract
based
or
as
jensen
said,
character
of
employment
based
and
that's
what
congress
wanted
to
feel
the
void
with.
jensen
had
said
to
the
state
act
“don't
touch
this
area
because
these
are
longshoreman,
the
character
of
their
employment.”
the
employment
relationship
is
such
that
they
cannot
be
made
to
come
under
an
area
of
exclusive
federal
confidence.
now,
when
--
mr.
ralph
rabinowitz
yes,
sir.
on
the
first
holding
of
the
fourth
circuit
below,
i
will
do
it
at
least
since
the
admiralty
extension
act
has
--
mr.
ralph
rabinowitz
i
would
say
this,
the
day
after
the
act
was
passed,
i
would
say
this
if
your
honor
please,
jensen
kept
longshoreman
from
recovering
under
state
acts,
why?
because
they
said
we
cannot
touch
this
area,
the
character
of
their
employment,
the
contract,
it
is
a
maritime
contract
which
cannot
be
touched.
it
is
an
area
of
exclusive
federal
confidence.
the
act
in
1927
was
passed
to
cover
these
men
that
the
state
acts
were
kept
from
helping.
and
congress
had
tried
two
times
to
make
a
state
act.
do
this
and
the
court
had
struck
that
down
in
1927.
the
court
came
along
and
filled
this
of
it.
congress
came
along
and
filled
this
void.
mr.
ralph
rabinowitz
yes,
your
honor,
there
was.
in
the
case
called,
for
example,
there
is
certainly
a
void
on
the
appeal.
in
the
case
called
johnson.
if
your
honor
please,
excuse
me
for
coming
but
i'll
find
the
case
in
a
moment.

a
1918
case.
a
man
has
slipped
down
on
the
pier.
he
tried
to
get
state
compensation.
mr.
ralph
rabinowitz
sir?
mr.
ralph
rabinowitz
some
did
but
there
was
this
area
where
nobody
knew
much
what
was
happening,
if
your
honor
please
and
this
was
what
congress
was
trying
to
do.
it
was
an
area
where
some
states
were
giving
the
man
compensation
on
the
dock.
some
states
were
not
giving
any
compensation
on
the
dock.
there
was
no
firm
line.
for
example
in
the
davis
case,
mr.
justice
black
recognize
this
and
quoted
from
jensen,
he
said
this,
quoting
jensen,
jensen
had
said
“when
a
state
could
and
when
it
could
not
grant
protection
under
a
compensation
act
was
left
as
a
perplexing
problem
for
it
was
held
difficult,
if
not
impossible
to
define
this
boundary
with
exactness.”
that's
quoted
exactly
from
jensen
and
mr.
justice
black
in
davis
re-quoted
that
and
said
“there
isn't
even
a
firm
line
when
the
state
act
could
apply
and
so
the
twilight
zone
document
was
started.”
even
before
the
admiralty
extension
act
in
the
o'donnell
case,
this
court
extended
the
jones
act
for
seamen
at
shore.
and
look
at
the
language
of
this
court
when
it's
juxtaposed
with
the
language
of
this
court
in
calbeck,
identical,
almost
identical
language.
in
o'donnell,
the
court
said,
and
this
is
before
the
admiralty
extension
act.
congress,
in
the
absence
of
any
indication
of
a
different
purpose
must
be
taken
to
have
intended
to
make
them
applicable
so
far
as
the
words
and
the
constitution
permit
and
to
have
given
to
them
the
full
support
of
all
the
constitutional
power
it
possessed.
hence,
the
act
allows
the
recovery
sought
unless
the
constitution
forbids
it.
if
you
just
juxtapose
that
language
with
the
language
of
this
court
in
calbeck,
it's
almost
identical
language.
mr.
ralph
rabinowitz
yes,
your
honor
and
--
they're
in
the
course
of
their
employment.
mr.
ralph
rabinowitz
in
some
cases,
there
would
be
a
duplication,
but
in
calbeck,
mr.
justice
brennan
said
that
he
didn't
--
he
said
there's
no
mutually
exclusive
area
here.
state
compensation
doesn't
preclude
federal
compensation,
it's
not
usually
exclusive
if
your
honor
please.
there
isn't
--
there
can
be
an
area
of
overlapping
jurisdiction.
however,
you
cannot
allow
federal
confidence
to
be
ruled
by
whether
or
not
a
state
acts,
whether
or
not
a
state
acts.
let
us
say
--
mr.
ralph
rabinowitz
no,
sir.
it
intended
to
fill
a
void
which
jensen
had
mainly
started
by
precluding
state
compensation
from
longshoreman
because
of
the
character
of
their
employment,
maritime
contract
and
if
your
honor
please,
this
is
clear
from
the
legislative
history.
in
the
senate
report,
particularly,
it
stated
just
like
that,
it
stated
in
these
terms,
if
your
honor
please
the
report
in
calbeck
--
if
i
can
find
it
in
just
a
moment.
the
act
is
construed.
the
legislative
history
is
construed
just
like
this
in
the
senate
report.
mr.
ralph
rabinowitz
i'm
looking
at
my
brief
on
page
24,
if
your
honor
please,
which
is
a
blue
brief
which
is
quoting
from
mr.
justice
sovalloff's
review
of
the
legislative
history.
page
24
from
the
senate
report
on
the
bottom
of
the
page
starting
with
the
indented
paragraph,
this
is
from
the
senate
report.
if
longshoreman
could
avail
themselves
of
the
benefit
of
state
compensation
laws,
there
would
be
no
occasion
for
this
legislation
but
unfortunately,
they
are
excluded
from
these
laws
by
reason
of
the
character
of
their
employment
and
they
are
not
only
excluded
but
the
supreme
court
has
more
than
once
held
that
federal
legislation
cannot
constitutionally
be
enacted
that
will
apply
state
laws
at
this
occupation.
and
there
congress
recognized
what
the
court
had
done
in
jensen.
it
had
said
because
of
the
character
of
the
longshoreman's
employment,
this
is
an
area
of
federal
confidence.
in
jensen
the
court
was
worried
about
lack
of
uniformity,
long
shoring
having
to
do
with
the
ships
that
go
from
port
to
port
and
they
said
this
is
an
area
of
federal
confidence.
going
on
to
just
the
realities
of
this
case,
we
have
the
very
simple
facts
that
this
ship
caused
the
injuries
here
and
the
case
could
go
off
on
those
facts
alone
but
i
suggest
that
the
court
should
construe
the
act
in
a
way
that
i
have
suggested
in
which
congress
mentioned.
congress,
if
you
read
the
debates
for
once,
you
find
that
the
employers
and
the
employee's
representatives
were
unanimous
in
wanting
a
broad
act.
they
wanted
an
act
that
would
cover
all
the
men,
all
the
longshoremen
in
the
course
of
their
employment.they
didn't
want
an
act
that
would
be
here
a
bit
there
a
bit.
and
it's
not
so
strange
to
cover
the
dock
in
the
course
of
maritime
employment.
when
a
ship
comes
into
a
dock,
a
ship
has
always
been
held
to
assert
thereby
a
possessory
character
over
the
dock.
way
back
in
ex
parte
eastern,
95
u.s.
68,
this
court
held
that
mortgage
had
to
be
paid.
but
the
ship
actually
started
to
have
a
proprietary
right
over
the
pier
when
it
tied
up
to
load
and
unload.
the
court
said
this,
access
to
the
ship
or
vessel
rightfully
occupying
a
birth
at
a
wharf
for
the
purposes
of
loading
and
unloading
is
the
undoubted
right
of
the
owner
or
charterer
of
such
a
ship
or
vessel
for
which
such
right
has
been
secured.
in
other
words,
the
character
of
that
right
is
a
possessory
right
of
the
ship
and
the
ship
caused
the
injuries
in
this
case.
now,
there
has
been
some
comment
about
whether
a
third
party
action
has
been
filed
in
certain
cases.
in
avery's
case,
no
third
party
action,
no
tort
action
has
been
filed.
avery
wants
his
federal
compensation.
he
was
hurt
in
1961.
he's
yet
to
get
it.
he's
a
longshoreman.
the
act
is
called
the
longshoreman's
act.
the
legislative
history
says
we
are
passing
this
act
to
give
the
longshoreman
the
benefit
of
compensation
and
i
suggest
to
this
court
that
there
is
no
common
sense
reason
and
no
reason
in
the
legislative
history
or
in
the
development
of
the
cases
in
this
court
to
keep
these
longshoremen
who
are
hurt
by
the
ship
because
they
happen
to
be
standing
on
the
dock
from
getting
federal
compensation
as
congress
intended.
the
petitioners
would
rely
strongly
on
swanson
against
marra
brothers.
swanson
was
not
a
case
under
the
longshoreman's
act,
simple
as
that.
it
was
not
a
case
in
this
court
where
the
man
had
asked
for
longshoreman's
act
benefits.
he
had
sued
the
ship
under
the
jones
act
and
he
had
not
sued
his
employer.
now,
the
jones
act
requires
you
to
sue
your
employer
and
that's
all
that
that
case
was
about,
simple
as
that.
this
case
today
is
ruled
by
calbeck.
the
language
in
calbeck
is
clear,
statements
are
not
hard
to
understand,
they
are
as
follows,
in
some
it
appears
that
the
longshoreman's
act
was
designed
to
ensure
that
a
compensation
readily
existed
for
all
injuries
sustained
by
employees
on
navigable
waters
and
to
avoid
uncertainty
as
to
the
source,
state
or
federal
of
that
remedy,
section
3
(a)
should
then
be
construed
to
achieve
those
purposes.
plainly,
the
court
of
appeals
interpretation
fixing
the
boundaries
of
federal
compensation
or
federal
coverage
where
the
outer
limits
of
state
confidence
had
been
left
by
pre-1927
constitutional
decisions
does
not
achieve
them.
there's
the
court
expressly
says
you
cannot
fix
the
boundaries
of
federal
conference
on
a
basis
of
pre-1927
constitutional
decisions,
again,
the
court
says
the
line
of
demarcation
is
not
a
static
one
fixed
by
pre-1927
constitutional
decisions.
again,
reiterating
what
the
court
said
in
calbeck,
congress
intended
to
exercise
to
the
fullest
extent
all
the
power
and
jurisdiction
it
had
over
the
subject
matter.
in
the
application
of
the
act
therefore,
the
brawl
of
his
ground,
it
permits
you
to
take
it.
why
didn't
the
court,
why
didn't
congress
include
docks
when
it
said
dry
docks
and
that's
simple.
dry
docks
are
in
the
main
on
dry
land,
they
were
then
they
are
now,
just
about
all
dry
docks
are
built
on
dry
land,
there
wasn't
any
reason
to
include
docks.
the
reason
they
had
to
put
dry
docks
on
there
as
an
express
addendum
was
because
they
were
built
on
dry
land
and
this
is
recognized
by
judge
palmerri
in
a
district
court
case,
the
arrien
case,
when
he
said
congress
obviously
expected
docks
to
be
covered
by
the
words
upon
navigable
waters
but
fear
that
dry
docks
might
be
held
by
the
courts
to
be
without
the
act.
and
therefore
felt
it
advisable
to
expressly
mention
the
latter.
mr.
ralph
rabinowitz
the
dry
dock
is
almost
always
on
land,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
ralph
rabinowitz
well,
they
have
a
pumping.
i'm
not
an
expert
on
dry
docks,
if
your
honor
please
but
once
i've
seen
the
new
panu
shipyard
--
mr.
ralph
rabinowitz
if
your
honor
please,
the
dry
docks
i've
seen
at
the
new
panu
shipyard
all
built
on
dry
land
but
there
might
be
some,
there
might
be
some
that
are
on
water,
they
have
some
that
pump
water
in
and
out.
i've
seen
that
but
most
of
the
ones
i've
seen
have
been
on
dry
land.
my
experience
however
has
been
confined
to
the
virginia
area.
now,
the
rodriguez
case--
mr.
ralph
rabinowitz
yes,
your
honor.
it
would.
mr.
ralph
rabinowitz
if
your
honor
please,
they
wanted
to
be
sure,
they
just
wanted
to
be
sure.
rodriguez
has
nothing
--
mr.
ralph
rabinowitz
not
really,
it's
a
different
--
mr.
ralph
rabinowitz
i
would
say
so,
yes
your
honor,
it's
a
different
angle.
one
is
having
to
do
with
ship
repair
and
construction,
the
other
has
to
do
with
the
live
vessel
loading
and
unloading.
if
your
honor
please,
the
rodriguez
case
has
nothing
to
do
that
i
can
see
with
this
case,
does
not
deal
with
the
longshore
act.
it
is
a
case
having
to
do
with
the
interaction
of
two
other
acts,
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
and
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act.
the
court
recognizes
that
admiralty
jurisdiction
would
obtain
if
a
vessel
caused
injury
as
was
the
case
here,
a
vessel
caused
injury
here.
the
court
expressly
recognize
in
rodrigue
if
a
vessel
causes
injury,
admiralty
jurisdiction
obtains.
the
most
important
case,
this
calbeck
and
i
say
calbeck
rules
in
the
instant
area.
nordenholt
began,
nordenholt
is
a
case,
it's
a
relic
before
congress
acted.
it's
a
relic
before
congress
action.
it
acted
where
the
supreme
court
stated
expressly
that
our
result
is
depending
upon
the
fact
that
there
is
no
pertinent
federal
statute,
there
is
no
pertinent
federal
statute
and
so
the
question
is,
are
we
going
to
let
this
widow
recover
before
the
federal
act
or
are
we
not
let
her
recover
because
jensen
had
said
he's
a
longshoreman
and
the
character
of
his
employment
keeps
us
from
helping
him,
under
the
state
act.
are
we
going
to
start
something,
are
we
going
to
retrogress
from
what
we
said
in
jensen
and
start
a
local
concern
document,
a
doctrine
which
was
a
beneficent
doctrine
to
let
the
state
act
go
ahead
and
give
the
widow
the
compensation.
with
the
addendum
that,
remember
there's
no
federal
statute,
with
sort
of
the
court
asking
congress,
get
on
the
stick,
come
on,
let's
pass
and
act
for
these
longshoremen.
nordenholt
in
1922
and
congress
responding
thereafter.
similarly,
t.
smith
&
son
which
is
relied
upon
by
the
petitioners.
again,
a
pre-1927
case,
well
perhaps
it
is
a
1928
however
the
death
occurred
in
1925
and
this
is
what
the
arrien
court
in
the
second
circuit
said
about
t.
smith
&
son.
the
court
simply
held
the
application
of
a
state
compensation
statute,
did
not
impose
approached
upon
admiralty
jurisdiction.
mr.
butler
--
mr.
justice
butler
and
understandably
did
not
mention
the
longshoreman's
act
for
the
federal
remedy
was
not
yet
effective.
finally,
i
say
to
this
court
that
the
holding
could
be
grounded
on
either
of
the
two
bases
at
the
fourth
circuit,
judge
sobeloff's
opinion
for
his
ground.
one,
the
character
of
the
employment
is
such
that
congress
meant
to
cover
these
injuries
and
jensen
had
precluded
state
compensation
in
this
area,
congress
dealt
with
this
area
and
used
the
full
power
at
hand.
or
secondly
or
alternatively
the
court
could
go
off
on
the
holding
on
the
basis
of
the
admiralty
extension
act.
the
admiralty
extension
act
says
in
its
legislative
history,
senate
report
number
1593,
second
section
pages
one
and
two.
for
example,
if
a
bridge
or
a
pier
or
any
person
or
property
situated
thereon
is
injured
by
a
vessel,
the
admiralty
courts
of
the
united
states
do
not
entertain
the
claim
for
damages
thus
caused,
this
was
before.
the
bill
under
consideration
would
provide
for
the
exercise
of
admiralty
in
maritime
jurisdiction
in
all
cases,
all
cases
in
the
type
of
i've
indicated.
now
it's
been
said
and
argued
that
the
longshore
act
wasn't
mentioned
in
this
act,
neither
was
the
warranty
of
seaworthiness,
either
was
a
whole
range
of
acts
of
congress.
certainly
it
wasn't
mentioned
because
the
legislative
history
says
that
the
jurisdiction
is
covered
in
all
these
cases,
all
these
cases.
so,
why
would
congress
then
have
to
go
down
and
say
when
we
mean
all
cases,
we
mean
the
longshore
act,
the
bridge
act,
the
rivers
act,
the
this
act.
they
didn't
have
to
do
that
and
the
admiralty
extension
act
has
been
applied
in
various
and
sundry
ways
that
were
never
mentioned
expressly
by
congress
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
admiralty
extension
act.
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
simply
stated
calbeck
rules
that
the
fourth
circuit's
opinion
embank
should
be
affirmed
that
there
is
no
good
reason
in
the
legislative
history
or
in
the
common
sense
of
the
situation
to
exclude
the
very
men
who
were
meant
to
be
helped
by
congress
from
the
benefits
of
this
act.
there's
nothing
in
the
literal
language
that
excludes
the
injuries
herein.
there's
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
that
excludes
the
injuries
herein.
the
only
reason
that
congress
didn't
use
maritime
jurisdiction
rather
than
upon
navigable
waters
is
because
they
were
afraid
that
maritime
jurisdiction,
that
phrase
was
too
restricted.
they
wanted
the
most
comprehensive
phrase
they
could
find
and
this
is
clear
on
the
legislative
history.
so,
i
respectfully
suggest
and
pray
that
this
court
affirm
the
decision
of
the
fourth
circuit
court
of
appeals
embank.
