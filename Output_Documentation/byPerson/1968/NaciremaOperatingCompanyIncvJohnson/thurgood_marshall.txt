mr.
coleman,
suppose
a
man
is
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
happens
if
the
longshoreman
is
on
the
ship
deck
it
did
not
into
the
pier?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that
was
it,
that's
why
i
can't
see
the
difference
when
he's
on
the
pier
and
gets
knocked
into
water.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
can't
give
the
line
up,
obviously?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
can't
do
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
couldn't
congress
always
also
said
in
the
parenthesis
dock
or
dry
dock?
justice
thurgood
marshall
suppose
that
derrick
was
on
the
building,
instead
of
the
ship.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
say
that
solidly
on
the
shore
wouldn't
make
any
difference?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
think
if
you
are
that
liberal,
it
wouldn't.
that's
a
problem.
isn't
that
what
our
problem
is,
is
interpreting
plain
language?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
longshoreman,
it's
in
the
same
gang
or
the
same
boss
doing
the
same
work.
but
there's
a
derrick
on
the
building
and
the
derrick
swings
loose
and
it
strikes
one
man
near
the
ship,
one
man
in
the
middle
of
the
pier,
another
man
up
against
the
building.
you
say
all
three
in
the
exact
same
position.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
he's
on
the
water.
he's
still
over
the
water.
justice
thurgood
marshall
even
though
he's
up
against
the
building?
