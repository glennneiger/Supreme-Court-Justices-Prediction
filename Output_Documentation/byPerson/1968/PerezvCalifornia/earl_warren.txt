chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
you
mr.
haws,
supposing
the
court
had
not
found
that
these
were
similar
offenses
and
therefore
that
he
could
be
cross-examined
on
that
scope
but
have
put
it
on
the
grounds
of
pure
waiver,
could
this
be
sustained?
chief
justice
earl
warren
so,
they
had
a
broader
scope
of
cross-examination
for
a
defendant
than
for
a
witness
--
ordinary
witness?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
suppose
the
witness
--
suppose
then
a
witness
in
this
trial
had
testified
as
to
count
one
only
but
you
have
cross-examined
him
as
to
two,
three
and
four?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that
i
would
be
--
there
is
a
difference
scope
then
according
to
our
theory
as
between
the
witness
and
a
defendant.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
it's
broader
for
the
defendant?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
i
don't
see
how
that
follows
if
you
say
that
if
he
testifies
concerning
one
count,
he
cannot
be
cross-examined
as
to
the
other
counts.
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
didn't
make
a
general
denial
on
the
witness
stand
as
two,
three
and
four?
chief
justice
earl
warren
just
one
and
two?
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
you
would
say
that
even
if
three
and
four
were
not
similar
offenses
under
the
similar
offense
rule
in
california
that
they
could
still
cross-examine
him
if
he
testified
concerning
one
and
two?
chief
justice
earl
warren
can
you
tell
us
in
just
a
moment
what
to
make
these
similar
offenses?
