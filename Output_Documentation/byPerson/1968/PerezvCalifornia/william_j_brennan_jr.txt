justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
you
do
agree
don't
you
that
we
have
to
get
to
counts
one
and
two
before
you
can
get
any
relief
at
all
on
any
of
these
counts?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but,
we
don't
know
what
there
concurring
sentence
si
moot?
nice
question
whether
it
is
even
though
a
case
of
controversy,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you're
familiar
with
the
ordinary
rule
that
we
don't
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
we'll
view
this
rather
concurrent
sentence
and
it's
conceded
at
least
that
two
of
the
convictions
must
stand
and
we
don't
reach
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know
you
haven't.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
said
they
were
tainted
and
i'm
trying
to
find
out
what
exactly
in
what
respect
you
say
that
the
convictions
by
the
jury
on
one
and
two
for
those
separate
crimes
were
tainted
by
the
comment
of
the
prosecutor
on
his
failure
to
testify
as
to
three
or
four
and
that's
what
i
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
you
have
to
say
don't
you
that
they
convicted
him
on
one
and
two
in
part
because
they
felt
that
he
was
not
to
be
believed
in
his
defense
on
one
and
two
if
he
didn't
take
the
stand
as
to
three
and
four.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
really
what
you're
saying.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
haws,
are
you
familiar
with
this
court's
decision
in
raley
versus
ohio?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
a
situation
and
which
the
witness
was
told
that
he
could
avail
himself
of
the
privilege
and
he
did
and
then
he
was
prosecuted
for
contempt
in
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
so
he
should've
been
told
that
he
could
avail
himself
to
the
privilege
because
it
was
an
immunity
statute.
therefore,
he
had
to
testify
and
this
court
held
that
the
states
can't
do
that
with
witnesses
like
plain
denial
of
due
process.
now,
how
do
you
distinguish
this
here
as
i
understand
it
what
happened
was
--
it
was
an
objection
and
it
was
sustained
on
the
ground
that
it
was
not
relevant
cross-examination
and
then
the
supreme
court
says,
“oh,
yes!
the
trial
judge
applied
the
wrong
rule
of
law”
but
that's
what
this
petitioner
acted
on,
wasn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
he
couldn't
obviously.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so,
the
point
here
is
that
the
objection
was
made
whatever
the
ground
of
the
objection
was.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
beyond
the
direct
testimony?
justice

j.

well,
