mr.
peter
g.
fetros
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
peter
g.
fetros,
i
represent
the
appellant
in
this
case,
mr.
enrique
perez.
in
this
case,
there
was
a
four-count
indictment
--
four-count
complaint
filed
against
my
client
concerning
three
different
instances.
two
of
--
the
first
two
counts
of
the
indictment
at
the
trial,
the
defendant
took
the
stand
and
testify
upon.
on
the
third
and
fourth
count
which
involved
one
incident
which
was
separate
from
the
first
two,
the
defendant
did
not
make
any
statement
on
the
stand
and
upon
being
cross-examined
or
attempted
to
be
cross-examined
by
the
district
attorney,
his
defense
attorney
raised
an
objection
which
was
sustained
by
the
trial
court.
thereafter,
there
was
no
further
attempt
to
cross-examine
the
defendant
on
a
separate
instant
the
third
and
fourth
counts.
in
addition
to
these
three
instances,
which
were
involved
in
the
case,
there
was
a
collateral
crime
which
was
brought
into
the
case
on
the
grounds
that
it
was
a
similar
modus
operandi.
the
court
allowed
the
collateral
crime
to
come
in
but
here
again
there
was
no
cross-examination
to
the
defendant
when
he
was
on
the
witness
stand.
during
closing
arguments
since
griffin
had
not
been
decided
by
this
court,
the
prosecutor
made
comment
on
the
fact
that
the
defendant
did
not
testify
as
to
counts
three
and
four
nor
was
he
able
to
cross-examine
him
concerning
counts
three
and
four
because
the
judge
had
told
him
that
he
was
not
able
to
cross-examine
the
defendant.
then,
the
instruction
was
given
which
is
the
same
instruction
which
is
contained
in
the
griffin
case
and
we
have
before
us
now
a
clear
case
to
determine
the
scope
of
the
waiver
of
the
privilege
of
self-incrimination
when
a
person
takes
to
stand
in
a
multi-count
indictment.
now,
we
have
an
unusual
situation
here
in
one
respect
that
the
trial
court
determined
the
district
attorney
could
not
cross-examine
on
counts
three
and
four.
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
california
said
this
was
in
error
that
the
counts
three
and
four
formulated
a
common
plan
and
design
and
therefore
cross-examination
under
the
california
statute
was
permissible.
it
then
went
on
to
say
that
due
to
the
federal
decisions
which
had
been
rendered
in
federal
cases
concerning
the
scope
of
the
waiver
of
the
privilege
that
the
privilege
extended
to
all
that
which
encompass
legitimate
cross-examination.
and
the
supreme
court
of
california
therefore
held
that
the
man
when
he
took
the
stand
waived
his
right
to
self-incrimination
as
to
counts
three
and
four
could've
been
examined
by
them
and
could
not
now
complain.
and
i
say
that
this
is
wrong
for
three
reasons
and
actually
for
four.
first,
the
crimes
three
and
four
were
not
specific
--
were
not
a
common
plan
in
design
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
although
the
supreme
court
held
that
in
that
case.
case
which
came
later
now
says
that
the
perez
case
which
is
the
one
on
appeal
here
is
to
be
very
limited
in
scope
when
determining
what
is
modus
operandi.
the
crimes
which
are
charged
involved
holdups
of
grocery
stores
and
taverns.
the
collateral
crime
which
was
brought
in
was
another
holdup
of
a
tavern.
the
timings
of
the
holdups
were
different.
there
were
holdups
in
the
7
o'clock
area.
there
were
holdups
in
the
1:30
area.
the
number
of
people
involved
were
different.
the
weapons
that
were
used
were
different
ranging
from
sort
of
rifles
to
pistols.
the
descriptions
of
the
people
who
supposedly
committed
the
crimes
were
different.
therefore,
i
say
that
there
was
not
this
common
plan
or
design
and
a
cross-examine
--
what
cross-examination
was
not
permissible
at
state
court
level.
but
even
if
there
was
a
common
plan
and
design
in
the
specific
case
as
other
cases
have
ruled
if
examination
for
evidence
is
admissible
for
a
particular
purpose,
its
probative
effect
may
be
outweighed
by
the
amount
of
prejudice
which
can
be
laid
in
against
the
defendant.
now,
on
these
multi-count
complaints,
the
man
is
on
trial
for
each
separate
crime
that
he
has
charged
with.
he
can
be
punished
each
separately.
he
has
to
--
the
district
attorney
has
to
prove
each
crime
separately.
therefore,
when
a
question
is
asked
in
cross-examination
concerning
one
of
the
other
two
crimes
we
have
the
direct
situation
where
the
man
is
--
they're
being
asked
to
testify
against
himself
on
those
particular
accounts.
mr.
peter
g.
fetros
yes.
mr.
peter
g.
fetros
concurrently
with
counts
one
and
two.
mr.
peter
g.
fetros
no,
his
maximum
sentence
therefore
would
be
at
the
exploration
of
count
of
two.
mr.
peter
g.
fetros
that's
correct.
mr.
peter
g.
fetros
that's
correct
and
of
course
in
california
we
have
the
indeterminate
sentence.
mr.
peter
g.
fetros
and
what
we
have
this
situation
in
the
parole
board
of
the
state
meets
and
determines
what
sentence
is
going
to
be
based
on
his
past
record
and
they
would
also
take
into
consideration
the
fact
that
he
was
convicted
of
these
crimes
in
determining
when
he
was
--
would
be
eligible.
mr.
peter
g.
fetros
that's
correct.
although,
it
could
make
a
difference
on
whether
or
not
one
and
two
was
extended
during
this
indeterminate
period
because
this
is
of
course
within
the
power
of
parole
board
--
mr.
peter
g.
fetros
that's
correct.
mr.
peter
g.
fetros
but
i
think
that
it
would
have
much
greater
bearing
to
know
that
he
was
actually
convicted
of
two
crimes
after
a
jury
trial
and
of
course
this
is
the
thing
that
we
are
concerned
with.
there
is
a
third
point
in
this
that
--
mr.
peter
g.
fetros
well,
i'm
asking
to
set
aside
three
and
four
because
--
mr.
peter
g.
fetros
yes,
because
i
don't
think
there
was
harmless.
the
error
was
harmless
--
mr.
peter
g.
fetros
no,
i
was
going
to
finish.
mr.
peter
g.
fetros
my
argument
is
that
since
this
trial
was
a
long
protracted
trial.
it
was
an
unusual
trial.
how
many
trials
do
we
have
or
witness
identifies
the
defense
attorney
as
the
defendant?
how
many
trials
do
we
have
she
is
being
taken
(voice
overlap)
in
the
courtroom?
these
things
all
occurred
in
the
trial
that
with
the
instruction
that
was
given
at
the
end
of
this
trial
on
three
and
four
the
confusion
was
completely
compounded
and
i
think
this
tainted
the
convictions
of
one
and
two.
i
don't
think
we
can
say
with
(voice
overlap).
mr.
peter
g.
fetros
yes,
i
am.
mr.
peter
g.
fetros
yes.
mr.
peter
g.
fetros
that's
correct
and
i
want
things
either
separate
when
they're
retried
and
then
the
clear
determination
made
by
the
jury
if
he
is
guilty
of
one,
two,
three
and
four.
now,
there
is
a
line
of
cases
in
the
federal
courts
that
would
indicate
that
if
the
judge
says
when
the
man
takes
a
stand,
you
are
not
waiving
the
privileges
against
self-incrimination
and
you
can't
turn
it
right
around
and
say
afterwards
that
well,
the
judge
made
a
mistake
so
you
are
waiving.
this
is
the
situation
where
in
the
johnson
case,
the
man
took
the
stand
and
he
testified
as
to
income
tax
evasion
counts
i
think
in
1933,
1934,
1935,
and
1936.
then
they
asked
him
a
question,
now,
what
about
1938
which
is
a
similar
collateral
crime.
the
judge
said,
“you
can't
ask
because
that's
beyond
cross-examination.”
this
court
reversed
on
the
basis
that
the
man
could
have
explained
something
possibly
if
he
was
forced
to
testify.
and
so
here
in
perez,
maybe
the
man
could
have
explained
something
if
the
objection
at
which
his
defense
attorney
raised
was
not
sustained.
instead,
what
happen,
they
sustained
the
objection
then
they
made
the
improper
argument
at
the
end
concerning
the
inferences
to
be
drawn.
now,
i
should
make
it
clear
that
this
last
method
of
finding
convictions
of
three
and
four
of
all
of
the
convictions
are
to
be
set
aside
is
of
course
easy
way
out
because
i
think
that
time
has
come
for
the
court
to
indicate
how
much
a
person
waives
when
he
takes
the
stand.
does
he
waive
it
as
to
all
cross-examination
or
does
he
waive
it
as
to
matters
which
are
only
within
his
knowledge?
caminetti
of
course
has
been
quoted
time
and
time
again
and
it's
being
a
case
that
says
that
all
available
relevant
cross-examination
is
allowed
and
you
waive
your
privilege
for
self-incrimination
to
that
extent.
but
that
really
isn't
what
its
saying.
the
reason
i
think
that
the
court
has
focused
in
to
the
griffin
rule
is
that
the
comment
and
the
instructions
which
are
given
focused
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
man
is
silent.
it's
in
effect
shattering
the
constitutional
right
to
remain
silent.
basically,
the
man
can't
testify
a
lot
of
these
things
because
he
doesn't
have
in
his
own
knowledge.
there
was
a
companion
case
in
perez
in
the
lower
court
level
called
ing.
now,
mr.
--
dr.
ing
was
charged
with
couple
counts
of
rate
by
the
use
of
drugs
and
they
brought
in
three
collateral
crimes
with
three
different
people
and
he
wasn't
charged
in
these
crimes.
he
had
testified
those
crimes
and
then
they
made
the
comment
concerning
the
fact
that
he
had
testified.
but
what
would
happen
if
instead
of
the
perez
case
where
there
was
some
possible
explanation
and
knowledge
on
his
part
in
this
cross-examination
area
that
the
cross
--
the
specific
question
he
was
asked
on
cross-examination
was,
why
were
you
so-and-so
in
his
house
with
the
two
men
immediately
after
the
robbery
which
occurred
in
counts
three
and
four.
if
we
change
the
facts
just
a
little
tiny
bit
and
say
that
counts
three
and
four
were
there
and
there
was
no
such
question.
are
we
to
say
that
because
it
is
a
similar
crime
which
i'm
not
agreeing
to
but
if
we
say
that
it's
because
it's
a
similar
crime
the
man
can
be
cross-examined
as
to
each
one
of
the
elements
of
the
crime.
and
i
don't
think
he
can
because
how
can
he
reasonably
be
expected
to
know
to
explain
and
defend
themselves
to
these
elements
which
are
beyond
his
knowledge.
it
isn't
that
really
the
thing
that
we're
saying
that
that
the
quick-witted
or
the
dull-witted
should
be
made
equal
that
when
they're
asked
the
question
about
where
they
were
at
particular
time
that
both
can
say
that
we
aren't
going
to
answer
or
rather
than
try
the
quick-witted
will
be
able
to
make
something
up
and
the
dull-witted
will
not.
i
think
that's
the
real
substance
of
the
griffin
rule
and
if
that
is
the
case,
then
what
i'm
saying
is
that
on
each
count
in
an
indictment
or
complaint.
the
man
should
be
able
not
to
say
anything
which
is
beyond
his
knowledge
on
those
matters
and
no
inference
can
be
drawn
from
the
fact
that
he
remains
silent.
he
just
doesn't
know;
what
were
you
doing
on
november
10,
1964?
how
can
he
defend
something
like
that?
maybe
it
is
something
usually
peculiarly
within
his
knowledge
but
i
think
that
in
this
day
and
age
everybody
realizes
that
unless
something
unusual
happens,
he
is
not
going
to
remember
what
happened
on
that
particular
day.
mr.
peter
g.
fetros
then,
we
get
into
this
idea
of
whether
the
instruction
focuses
attention
onto
the
fact
that
he
didn't
remain
--
that
he
remained
silent
and
didn't
explain
something.
and
this
is
where
the
problem
comes
in
just
like
in
griffin
you're
focusing
attention
to
something
that
you're
attempting
to
protect.
mr.
peter
g.
fetros
well,
it's
just
the
same
factual
realities
of
life.
when
any
instruction
is
given
to
the
jury,
they
are
supposed
to
be
able
to
understand
the
instructions
but
how
about
the
cases
let's
say
when
you
give
--
when
you
have
a
and
b
on
trial
and
you
have
a's
confession
and
then
don't
apply
it
to
b.
now,
this
court
held
recently
that
you
can't
desegregate
these
people
that
closely.
in
the
federal
system,
we
don't
really
have
the
problem
that
we
have
that's
before
us
here.
now,
this
is
probably
a
unique
problem
or
to
california
and
maybe
a
few
other
states
in
the
--
mr.
peter
g.
fetros
no,
there
is
just
one
place
on
counts
three
and
four.
one
man
was
bartender
and
--
mr.
peter
g.
fetros
that's
right.
mr.
peter
g.
fetros
that's
correct.
he
had
it
now
--
mr.
peter
g.
fetros
that's
correct.
he
had
alibis
for
those
episodes.
mr.
peter
g.
fetros
well,
i
don't
think
we
can
be
reasonably
certain
that
that
after
the
jury
went
in
to
the
jury
room.
they
took
all
of
this
evidence
and
were
able
to
piss
it
out.
now,
this
is
what
i'm
saying.
if
we
could
find
but
i
don't
think
we
can
in
this
case.
mr.
peter
g.
fetros
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
peter
g.
fetros
yes,
on
the
harmless
error.
mr.
peter
g.
fetros
in
the
supreme
court?
mr.
peter
g.
fetros
i
believe
they
did
find
it
that
it
was
harmful.
mr.
peter
g.
fetros
i
think
they
did
find
that
it
was
harmless.
mr.
peter
g.
fetros
that's
correct.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
i
think
that
when
this
inference
came
in
as
to
three
and
four
they
were
attempting
to
segregate
to
three
and
four
but
they
couldn't
do
it
with
the
scope
of
the
trial
and
the
type
of
evidence
have
came
in
and
these
other
matters
that
happened.
this
witness
who
i
say
identified
the
defense
attorney
was
a
witness
in
count
one
or
either
one
of
two
and
she
says,
that's
the
man
who
did
it
and
here's
the
defense
attorney
saying
there.
they
did
take
off
the
man's
shoes
in
the
trial,
it
was
rather
strange
trial
to
note.
mr.
peter
g.
fetros
yes,
that
alibi
and
then
he
had
two,
i
believe
he
had
his
brother
or
his
brother
and
mother
or
brother-in-law
and
his
mother
who
testified
as
to
where
they
were.
mr.
peter
g.
fetros
oh!
yes,
definitely.
and
the
problem
there
is
what
sort
of
--
mr.
peter
g.
fetros
that's
right.
they
were
narrowing
in
on
his
failure
to
be
cross-examined
on
three
and
four.
there
was
no
question
on
that.
the
next
case,
it
comes
up
with
probably
be
a
case
where
they
have
no
comment
on
three
and
four
but
they
try
to
say
that
he
failed
to
explain
something
back
in
one
and
two.
and
here
again,
we
have
the
same
problem
because
we're
citing
in
the
jury
into
the
privilege.
mr.
peter
g.
fetros
no,
you
could
reverse
as
to
three
and
four
without
reversing
as
to
one
and
two.
mr.
peter
g.
fetros
i'm
sorry
i
just
can't
answer
that.
mr.
peter
g.
fetros
yes.
mr.
peter
g.
fetros
well,
i
haven't
conceded
them.
i'm
--
mr.
peter
g.
fetros
no.
mr.
peter
g.
fetros
well,
because
on
three
and
four
now
you're
also
bringing
in
the
idea
that
by
finding
him
guilty
of
three
and
four
if
they're
saying
that
it's
a
similar
type
of
crime.
mr.
peter
g.
fetros
that's
correct.
mr.
peter
g.
fetros
that's
right.
we
can't
say
how
much
they
just
count
in
two.
maybe
it
was
just
right
there
on
the
border
line
and
they
just
sheltered
over
because
of
these
inferences.
that's
what
basically
what
i'm
saying
and
that
it
would
be
fair
to
send
it
back
for
retrial
in
severed
counts
but
that's
what
we
have
to
do.
in
the
federal
system
when
there
is
a
joinder
of
counts
and
there
is
prejudice
which
is
possible
to
the
defendant,
they
sever
as
a
matter
of
right
if
this
is
brought
out
prior
to
trial.
in
california
of
course,
we
don't
have
that
because
they
have
this
comment.
so,
based
on
that,
we
are
requesting
a
dismissible,
we're
requesting
also
a
reversal
--
we're
also
requesting
a
broad
rule
in
respect
to
when
a
person
does
take
the
stand
what
does
he
waive
his
right
to
the
all
of
the
counts
charge
or
his
right
to
be
collateral
offenses
charge
or
to
both.
thank
you.
mr.
peter
g.
fetros
i
just
want
to
make
one
very
brief
comment
and
that's
the
use
of
the
term
“cross-examination”
by
the
california
supreme
court.
it's
not
being
used
i
don't
think
in
the
same
sense
that
we're
thinking
of
it.
there's
direct
examination
and
then
there's
cross
it's
on
the
direct
but
they're
saying
is
that
there's
a
further
area
which
makes
the
defendant
the
prosecutor's
witness
and
this
is
the
whole
area
that
this
thing
opens
up
if
we
allow
this
type
of
theory
to
stand
then
in
effect
on
a
charged
crime
the
district
attorney
can
ask
any
question
he
wants
concerning
a
charged
crime
which
is
similar
in
modus
operandi.
he
can
say,
“where
were
you,
what
were
you
doing?”
you
know,
“how
can
you
explain
this?”
go
through
the
whole
thing
as
if
he
is
in
the
civil
case
he
was
calling
the
guys
an
adverse
witness.
the
supreme
court
of
california
used
the
term
“cross-examination”
is
proper
but
it's
a
little
bit
different
that
we
normally
think
of.
the
man
is
on
the
stand
at
that
time
and
you're
asking
him
these
questions
that
in
effect
they're
making
him
--
the
district
attorney
is
making
him
as
his
witness
to
prove
elements
of
the
crime.
and
if
this
thing
is
allowed
to
stand,
they're
saying
that
the
district
attorney
can
elicit
from
the
defendant
as
to
counts
three
and
four
all
of
the
necessary
elements
by
asking
questions
which
they
say
are
cross-examination
which
i
say
is
really
just
direct
examination.
they
don't
have
any
relationship
to
the
questions
which
were
asked
on
--
by
the
defense
attorney
at
all.
it
could
be
anything
because
that's
what
they're
saying.
thank
you.
mr.
peter
g.
fetros
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
peter
g.
fetros,
i
represent
the
appellant
in
this
case,
mr.
enrique
perez.
in
this
case,
there
was
a
four-count
indictment
--
four-count
complaint
filed
against
my
client
concerning
three
different
instances.
two
of
--
the
first
two
counts
of
the
indictment
at
the
trial,
the
defendant
took
the
stand
and
testify
upon.
on
the
third
and
fourth
count
which
involved
one
incident
which
was
separate
from
the
first
two,
the
defendant
did
not
make
any
statement
on
the
stand
and
upon
being
cross-examined
or
attempted
to
be
cross-examined
by
the
district
attorney,
his
defense
attorney
raised
an
objection
which
was
sustained
by
the
trial
court.
thereafter,
there
was
no
further
attempt
to
cross-examine
the
defendant
on
a
separate
instant
the
third
and
fourth
counts.
in
addition
to
these
three
instances,
which
were
involved
in
the
case,
there
was
a
collateral
crime
which
was
brought
into
the
case
on
the
grounds
that
it
was
a
similar
modus
operandi.
the
court
allowed
the
collateral
crime
to
come
in
but
here
again
there
was
no
cross-examination
to
the
defendant
when
he
was
on
the
witness
stand.
during
closing
arguments
since
griffin
had
not
been
decided
by
this
court,
the
prosecutor
made
comment
on
the
fact
that
the
defendant
did
not
testify
as
to
counts
three
and
four
nor
was
he
able
to
cross-examine
him
concerning
counts
three
and
four
because
the
judge
had
told
him
that
he
was
not
able
to
cross-examine
the
defendant.
then,
the
instruction
was
given
which
is
the
same
instruction
which
is
contained
in
the
griffin
case
and
we
have
before
us
now
a
clear
case
to
determine
the
scope
of
the
waiver
of
the
privilege
of
self-incrimination
when
a
person
takes
to
stand
in
a
multi-count
indictment.
now,
we
have
an
unusual
situation
here
in
one
respect
that
the
trial
court
determined
the
district
attorney
could
not
cross-examine
on
counts
three
and
four.
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
california
said
this
was
in
error
that
the
counts
three
and
four
formulated
a
common
plan
and
design
and
therefore
cross-examination
under
the
california
statute
was
permissible.
it
then
went
on
to
say
that
due
to
the
federal
decisions
which
had
been
rendered
in
federal
cases
concerning
the
scope
of
the
waiver
of
the
privilege
that
the
privilege
extended
to
all
that
which
encompass
legitimate
cross-examination.
and
the
supreme
court
of
california
therefore
held
that
the
man
when
he
took
the
stand
waived
his
right
to
self-incrimination
as
to
counts
three
and
four
could've
been
examined
by
them
and
could
not
now
complain.
and
i
say
that
this
is
wrong
for
three
reasons
and
actually
for
four.
first,
the
crimes
three
and
four
were
not
specific
--
were
not
a
common
plan
in
design
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
although
the
supreme
court
held
that
in
that
case.
case
which
came
later
now
says
that
the
perez
case
which
is
the
one
on
appeal
here
is
to
be
very
limited
in
scope
when
determining
what
is
modus
operandi.
the
crimes
which
are
charged
involved
holdups
of
grocery
stores
and
taverns.
the
collateral
crime
which
was
brought
in
was
another
holdup
of
a
tavern.
the
timings
of
the
holdups
were
different.
there
were
holdups
in
the
7
o'clock
area.
there
were
holdups
in
the
1:30
area.
the
number
of
people
involved
were
different.
the
weapons
that
were
used
were
different
ranging
from
sort
of
rifles
to
pistols.
the
descriptions
of
the
people
who
supposedly
committed
the
crimes
were
different.
therefore,
i
say
that
there
was
not
this
common
plan
or
design
and
a
cross-examine
--
what
cross-examination
was
not
permissible
at
state
court
level.
but
even
if
there
was
a
common
plan
and
design
in
the
specific
case
as
other
cases
have
ruled
if
examination
for
evidence
is
admissible
for
a
particular
purpose,
its
probative
effect
may
be
outweighed
by
the
amount
of
prejudice
which
can
be
laid
in
against
the
defendant.
now,
on
these
multi-count
complaints,
the
man
is
on
trial
for
each
separate
crime
that
he
has
charged
with.
he
can
be
punished
each
separately.
he
has
to
--
the
district
attorney
has
to
prove
each
crime
separately.
therefore,
when
a
question
is
asked
in
cross-examination
concerning
one
of
the
other
two
crimes
we
have
the
direct
situation
where
the
man
is
--
they're
being
asked
to
testify
against
himself
on
those
particular
accounts.
mr.
peter
g.
fetros
yes.
mr.
peter
g.
fetros
concurrently
with
counts
one
and
two.
mr.
peter
g.
fetros
no,
his
maximum
sentence
therefore
would
be
at
the
exploration
of
count
of
two.
mr.
peter
g.
fetros
that's
correct.
mr.
peter
g.
fetros
that's
correct
and
of
course
in
california
we
have
the
indeterminate
sentence.
mr.
peter
g.
fetros
and
what
we
have
this
situation
in
the
parole
board
of
the
state
meets
and
determines
what
sentence
is
going
to
be
based
on
his
past
record
and
they
would
also
take
into
consideration
the
fact
that
he
was
convicted
of
these
crimes
in
determining
when
he
was
--
would
be
eligible.
mr.
peter
g.
fetros
that's
correct.
although,
it
could
make
a
difference
on
whether
or
not
one
and
two
was
extended
during
this
indeterminate
period
because
this
is
of
course
within
the
power
of
parole
board
--
mr.
peter
g.
fetros
that's
correct.
mr.
peter
g.
fetros
but
i
think
that
it
would
have
much
greater
bearing
to
know
that
he
was
actually
convicted
of
two
crimes
after
a
jury
trial
and
of
course
this
is
the
thing
that
we
are
concerned
with.
there
is
a
third
point
in
this
that
--
mr.
peter
g.
fetros
well,
i'm
asking
to
set
aside
three
and
four
because
--
mr.
peter
g.
fetros
yes,
because
i
don't
think
there
was
harmless.
the
error
was
harmless
--
mr.
peter
g.
fetros
no,
i
was
going
to
finish.
mr.
peter
g.
fetros
my
argument
is
that
since
this
trial
was
a
long
protracted
trial.
it
was
an
unusual
trial.
how
many
trials
do
we
have
or
witness
identifies
the
defense
attorney
as
the
defendant?
how
many
trials
do
we
have
she
is
being
taken
(voice
overlap)
in
the
courtroom?
these
things
all
occurred
in
the
trial
that
with
the
instruction
that
was
given
at
the
end
of
this
trial
on
three
and
four
the
confusion
was
completely
compounded
and
i
think
this
tainted
the
convictions
of
one
and
two.
i
don't
think
we
can
say
with
(voice
overlap).
mr.
peter
g.
fetros
yes,
i
am.
mr.
peter
g.
fetros
yes.
mr.
peter
g.
fetros
that's
correct
and
i
want
things
either
separate
when
they're
retried
and
then
the
clear
determination
made
by
the
jury
if
he
is
guilty
of
one,
two,
three
and
four.
now,
there
is
a
line
of
cases
in
the
federal
courts
that
would
indicate
that
if
the
judge
says
when
the
man
takes
a
stand,
you
are
not
waiving
the
privileges
against
self-incrimination
and
you
can't
turn
it
right
around
and
say
afterwards
that
well,
the
judge
made
a
mistake
so
you
are
waiving.
this
is
the
situation
where
in
the
johnson
case,
the
man
took
the
stand
and
he
testified
as
to
income
tax
evasion
counts
i
think
in
1933,
1934,
1935,
and
1936.
then
they
asked
him
a
question,
now,
what
about
1938
which
is
a
similar
collateral
crime.
the
judge
said,
“you
can't
ask
because
that's
beyond
cross-examination.”
this
court
reversed
on
the
basis
that
the
man
could
have
explained
something
possibly
if
he
was
forced
to
testify.
and
so
here
in
perez,
maybe
the
man
could
have
explained
something
if
the
objection
at
which
his
defense
attorney
raised
was
not
sustained.
instead,
what
happen,
they
sustained
the
objection
then
they
made
the
improper
argument
at
the
end
concerning
the
inferences
to
be
drawn.
now,
i
should
make
it
clear
that
this
last
method
of
finding
convictions
of
three
and
four
of
all
of
the
convictions
are
to
be
set
aside
is
of
course
easy
way
out
because
i
think
that
time
has
come
for
the
court
to
indicate
how
much
a
person
waives
when
he
takes
the
stand.
does
he
waive
it
as
to
all
cross-examination
or
does
he
waive
it
as
to
matters
which
are
only
within
his
knowledge?
caminetti
of
course
has
been
quoted
time
and
time
again
and
it's
being
a
case
that
says
that
all
available
relevant
cross-examination
is
allowed
and
you
waive
your
privilege
for
self-incrimination
to
that
extent.
but
that
really
isn't
what
its
saying.
the
reason
i
think
that
the
court
has
focused
in
to
the
griffin
rule
is
that
the
comment
and
the
instructions
which
are
given
focused
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
man
is
silent.
it's
in
effect
shattering
the
constitutional
right
to
remain
silent.
basically,
the
man
can't
testify
a
lot
of
these
things
because
he
doesn't
have
in
his
own
knowledge.
there
was
a
companion
case
in
perez
in
the
lower
court
level
called
ing.
now,
mr.
--
dr.
ing
was
charged
with
couple
counts
of
rate
by
the
use
of
drugs
and
they
brought
in
three
collateral
crimes
with
three
different
people
and
he
wasn't
charged
in
these
crimes.
he
had
testified
those
crimes
and
then
they
made
the
comment
concerning
the
fact
that
he
had
testified.
but
what
would
happen
if
instead
of
the
perez
case
where
there
was
some
possible
explanation
and
knowledge
on
his
part
in
this
cross-examination
area
that
the
cross
--
the
specific
question
he
was
asked
on
cross-examination
was,
why
were
you
so-and-so
in
his
house
with
the
two
men
immediately
after
the
robbery
which
occurred
in
counts
three
and
four.
if
we
change
the
facts
just
a
little
tiny
bit
and
say
that
counts
three
and
four
were
there
and
there
was
no
such
question.
are
we
to
say
that
because
it
is
a
similar
crime
which
i'm
not
agreeing
to
but
if
we
say
that
it's
because
it's
a
similar
crime
the
man
can
be
cross-examined
as
to
each
one
of
the
elements
of
the
crime.
and
i
don't
think
he
can
because
how
can
he
reasonably
be
expected
to
know
to
explain
and
defend
themselves
to
these
elements
which
are
beyond
his
knowledge.
it
isn't
that
really
the
thing
that
we're
saying
that
that
the
quick-witted
or
the
dull-witted
should
be
made
equal
that
when
they're
asked
the
question
about
where
they
were
at
particular
time
that
both
can
say
that
we
aren't
going
to
answer
or
rather
than
try
the
quick-witted
will
be
able
to
make
something
up
and
the
dull-witted
will
not.
i
think
that's
the
real
substance
of
the
griffin
rule
and
if
that
is
the
case,
then
what
i'm
saying
is
that
on
each
count
in
an
indictment
or
complaint.
the
man
should
be
able
not
to
say
anything
which
is
beyond
his
knowledge
on
those
matters
and
no
inference
can
be
drawn
from
the
fact
that
he
remains
silent.
he
just
doesn't
know;
what
were
you
doing
on
november
10,
1964?
how
can
he
defend
something
like
that?
maybe
it
is
something
usually
peculiarly
within
his
knowledge
but
i
think
that
in
this
day
and
age
everybody
realizes
that
unless
something
unusual
happens,
he
is
not
going
to
remember
what
happened
on
that
particular
day.
mr.
peter
g.
fetros
then,
we
get
into
this
idea
of
whether
the
instruction
focuses
attention
onto
the
fact
that
he
didn't
remain
--
that
he
remained
silent
and
didn't
explain
something.
and
this
is
where
the
problem
comes
in
just
like
in
griffin
you're
focusing
attention
to
something
that
you're
attempting
to
protect.
mr.
peter
g.
fetros
well,
it's
just
the
same
factual
realities
of
life.
when
any
instruction
is
given
to
the
jury,
they
are
supposed
to
be
able
to
understand
the
instructions
but
how
about
the
cases
let's
say
when
you
give
--
when
you
have
a
and
b
on
trial
and
you
have
a's
confession
and
then
don't
apply
it
to
b.
now,
this
court
held
recently
that
you
can't
desegregate
these
people
that
closely.
in
the
federal
system,
we
don't
really
have
the
problem
that
we
have
that's
before
us
here.
now,
this
is
probably
a
unique
problem
or
to
california
and
maybe
a
few
other
states
in
the
--
mr.
peter
g.
fetros
no,
there
is
just
one
place
on
counts
three
and
four.
one
man
was
bartender
and
--
mr.
peter
g.
fetros
that's
right.
mr.
peter
g.
fetros
that's
correct.
he
had
it
now
--
mr.
peter
g.
fetros
that's
correct.
he
had
alibis
for
those
episodes.
mr.
peter
g.
fetros
well,
i
don't
think
we
can
be
reasonably
certain
that
that
after
the
jury
went
in
to
the
jury
room.
they
took
all
of
this
evidence
and
were
able
to
piss
it
out.
now,
this
is
what
i'm
saying.
if
we
could
find
but
i
don't
think
we
can
in
this
case.
mr.
peter
g.
fetros
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
peter
g.
fetros
yes,
on
the
harmless
error.
mr.
peter
g.
fetros
in
the
supreme
court?
mr.
peter
g.
fetros
i
believe
they
did
find
it
that
it
was
harmful.
mr.
peter
g.
fetros
i
think
they
did
find
that
it
was
harmless.
mr.
peter
g.
fetros
that's
correct.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
i
think
that
when
this
inference
came
in
as
to
three
and
four
they
were
attempting
to
segregate
to
three
and
four
but
they
couldn't
do
it
with
the
scope
of
the
trial
and
the
type
of
evidence
have
came
in
and
these
other
matters
that
happened.
this
witness
who
i
say
identified
the
defense
attorney
was
a
witness
in
count
one
or
either
one
of
two
and
she
says,
that's
the
man
who
did
it
and
here's
the
defense
attorney
saying
there.
they
did
take
off
the
man's
shoes
in
the
trial,
it
was
rather
strange
trial
to
note.
mr.
peter
g.
fetros
yes,
that
alibi
and
then
he
had
two,
i
believe
he
had
his
brother
or
his
brother
and
mother
or
brother-in-law
and
his
mother
who
testified
as
to
where
they
were.
mr.
peter
g.
fetros
oh!
yes,
definitely.
and
the
problem
there
is
what
sort
of
--
mr.
peter
g.
fetros
that's
right.
they
were
narrowing
in
on
his
failure
to
be
cross-examined
on
three
and
four.
there
was
no
question
on
that.
the
next
case,
it
comes
up
with
probably
be
a
case
where
they
have
no
comment
on
three
and
four
but
they
try
to
say
that
he
failed
to
explain
something
back
in
one
and
two.
and
here
again,
we
have
the
same
problem
because
we're
citing
in
the
jury
into
the
privilege.
mr.
peter
g.
fetros
no,
you
could
reverse
as
to
three
and
four
without
reversing
as
to
one
and
two.
mr.
peter
g.
fetros
i'm
sorry
i
just
can't
answer
that.
mr.
peter
g.
fetros
yes.
mr.
peter
g.
fetros
well,
i
haven't
conceded
them.
i'm
--
mr.
peter
g.
fetros
no.
mr.
peter
g.
fetros
well,
because
on
three
and
four
now
you're
also
bringing
in
the
idea
that
by
finding
him
guilty
of
three
and
four
if
they're
saying
that
it's
a
similar
type
of
crime.
mr.
peter
g.
fetros
that's
correct.
mr.
peter
g.
fetros
that's
right.
we
can't
say
how
much
they
just
count
in
two.
maybe
it
was
just
right
there
on
the
border
line
and
they
just
sheltered
over
because
of
these
inferences.
that's
what
basically
what
i'm
saying
and
that
it
would
be
fair
to
send
it
back
for
retrial
in
severed
counts
but
that's
what
we
have
to
do.
in
the
federal
system
when
there
is
a
joinder
of
counts
and
there
is
prejudice
which
is
possible
to
the
defendant,
they
sever
as
a
matter
of
right
if
this
is
brought
out
prior
to
trial.
in
california
of
course,
we
don't
have
that
because
they
have
this
comment.
so,
based
on
that,
we
are
requesting
a
dismissible,
we're
requesting
also
a
reversal
--
we're
also
requesting
a
broad
rule
in
respect
to
when
a
person
does
take
the
stand
what
does
he
waive
his
right
to
the
all
of
the
counts
charge
or
his
right
to
be
collateral
offenses
charge
or
to
both.
thank
you.
mr.
peter
g.
fetros
i
just
want
to
make
one
very
brief
comment
and
that's
the
use
of
the
term
“cross-examination”
by
the
california
supreme
court.
it's
not
being
used
i
don't
think
in
the
same
sense
that
we're
thinking
of
it.
there's
direct
examination
and
then
there's
cross
it's
on
the
direct
but
they're
saying
is
that
there's
a
further
area
which
makes
the
defendant
the
prosecutor's
witness
and
this
is
the
whole
area
that
this
thing
opens
up
if
we
allow
this
type
of
theory
to
stand
then
in
effect
on
a
charged
crime
the
district
attorney
can
ask
any
question
he
wants
concerning
a
charged
crime
which
is
similar
in
modus
operandi.
he
can
say,
“where
were
you,
what
were
you
doing?”
you
know,
“how
can
you
explain
this?”
go
through
the
whole
thing
as
if
he
is
in
the
civil
case
he
was
calling
the
guys
an
adverse
witness.
the
supreme
court
of
california
used
the
term
“cross-examination”
is
proper
but
it's
a
little
bit
different
that
we
normally
think
of.
the
man
is
on
the
stand
at
that
time
and
you're
asking
him
these
questions
that
in
effect
they're
making
him
--
the
district
attorney
is
making
him
as
his
witness
to
prove
elements
of
the
crime.
and
if
this
thing
is
allowed
to
stand,
they're
saying
that
the
district
attorney
can
elicit
from
the
defendant
as
to
counts
three
and
four
all
of
the
necessary
elements
by
asking
questions
which
they
say
are
cross-examination
which
i
say
is
really
just
direct
examination.
they
don't
have
any
relationship
to
the
questions
which
were
asked
on
--
by
the
defense
attorney
at
all.
it
could
be
anything
because
that's
what
they're
saying.
thank
you.
