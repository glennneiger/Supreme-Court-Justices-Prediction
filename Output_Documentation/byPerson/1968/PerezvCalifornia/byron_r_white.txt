justice
byron
r.
white
i
gather
in
count
one
concerned
the
robbery
in
january
3
at
the
white
club,
count
two
were
robbery
on
january
15,
(inaudible)
and
three
and
four,
robbery
that's
still
third
and
fourth
places
in
january
13,
is
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
january
15
justice
byron
r.
white
had
he
took
the
stand
and
testified
on
defense
on
the
accusation
of
robberies
on
january
3rd
and
january
15th,
is
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
didn't
you
say
that
those
convictions
are
pleaded
by
the
count
of
three
and
four?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
this
touch
on
harmless
error
problem?
justice
byron
r.
white
from
the
chapman
on
the
harmless
error?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
there
a
harmless
error
finding
here
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
my
difficulty
is
and
these
are
concurrent
sentences.
if
you
already
said
we
can't
get
to
the
convictions
on
one
or
two
unless
we
find
that
this
comment
on
as
to
three
and
four
somehow
infected
convictions
on
robberies
with
so
in
different
days
and
i
take
involved
entirely
separate
facts
and
you
suggest
that
the
defense
was
alibi
as
those
two?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
defendant
did
testify
himself
to
counts
one
and
two,
didn't
he?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
i
suppose
that
his
evidence
whatever
he
testified
to
or
didn't
testify
to
it
to
counts
one
and
two
could've
been
come
on
his
own.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you're
saying
that
comment
on
his
failure
to
talk
about
three
and
four
obtained
in
his
convictions
on
one
and
two?
justice
byron
r.
white
may
i
ask
you
mr.
haws?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
find
in
your
brief
that
you
make
any
argument
based
on
concurrence?
justice
byron
r.
white
don't
you
think
there
are
any
--
do
you
have
any
replacements?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
wanted
us
really
to
decide
the
waiver
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
it's
not
really
presented
by
the
case
provided
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
here
was
just
decided
constitutional
question,
you
migth
use
that
of
rule,
do
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
in
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
would
happen
if
there
was
an
objection
to
the
cross-examination
about
counts
three
and
four?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
objection
that
was
sustained?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so,
there
was
no
testimony
about
three
and
four
for
him?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
there
was
comment?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
the
california
supreme
court
said,
“no,
the
law
in
california
that
there
was
no
privilege
as
to
counts
three
and
four.”
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so,
he
should've
testified?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
should've
been
force
to
testify?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
he
has
no
privilege
and
he's
asked
the
question
on
cross-examination
and
on
privilege
question
and
he
refuses
to
answer,
what
happens?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
didn't
instruct
him
to
answer,
don't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
do
you
think
the
defendant
would've
done
if
he
had
found
out
and
he
had
mistakenly
claimed
his
privilege
and
it
has
been
mistakenly
upheld,
do
you
think
he'd
rather
had
comment
or
would
he
rather
testify?
justice
byron
r.
white
there
wasn't?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
was
the
objection
based
on?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
see.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
he's
claiming
that
privilege.
he's
claiming
the
privilege
now.
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right,
do
you
think
the
supreme
court
of
california
also
said
that
this
was
unprivileged?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
said,
this
isn't
beyond
the
scope
of
cross-examination.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
they
also
rule
that
was
unprivileged?
justice
byron
r.
white
didn't
they
have
to?
they
had
to
in
order
to
permit
the
comment?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
unless
you
utilize
the
concurring
sentence
rule
mr.
justice
brennan
was
asking
you
about
it.
it
seems
to
me
that
raley
against
ohio
and
murphy
against
waterfront
and
cases
like
that
really
are
very
relevant.
justice
byron
r.
white
because
i'm
not
so
sure
of
what
--
did
not
know
that
he
was
suppose
to
testify
that
he
would
rather
testify
than
have
to
comment.
justice
byron
r.
white
because
the
supreme
court
certainly
upheld
the
comment.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
anyway
that
he
did
has
a
choice
in
the
sense
that
he
knew
there
was
going
to
be
comment
he
didn't
testify?
was
that
the
california
law
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
that
instead
of
the
judgment
is
affirmed
which
submits
judgment
of
the
conviction
at
all
four
counts
charged?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
same
comment
would've
been
justified
if
he
didn't
--
justice
byron
