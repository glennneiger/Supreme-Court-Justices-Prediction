mr.
edsel
w.
haws
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
we
have
the
california
comment
rule
here
again
to
day
but
under
much
different
circumstances
and
presented
in
griffin
and
in
the
chapman
case.
in
griffin,
as
you
recall
the
defendant
did
not
testify
and
it
was
there
held
that
that
part
of
the
comment
rule
of
california
which
permitted
comment
by
the
prosecutor
and
a
standard
instruction
by
the
court
cut
down
and
violated
his
fifth
amendment
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
now,
today,
we
have
the
other
side
of
the
coin
as
it
were
of
our
comment
rule.
our
california
constitution
permits
comment
in
those
situations
as
here
where
he
does
take
the
stand
and
fails
to
explain
evidence
--
fails
to
explain
or
deny
evidence
within
his
knowledge.
now,
it
is
respondent's
position
that
the
privilege
does
not
apply
and
the
california
comment
rule
is
valid
here
in
this
situation
where
he
does
take
the
stand
but
fails
to
explain
or
deny
facts
within
his
knowledge.
we
think
this
conclusion
follows
from
the
proposition
and
the
many
cases
that
by
taking
the
stand
voluntarily
as
here
he
waives
his
right
--
he
waives
his
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
the
waiver
of
course
under
the
holding
below
is
not
unlimited.
the
waiver
in
this
case
and
in
the
many
federal
cases
is
cited
in
our
brief
is
determined
by
the
scope
of
relevant
cross-examination.
the
landmark
case
of
course
cited
in
our
brief
is
caminetti
that
has
been
followed
in
such
leading
cases
as
johnson
versus
the
united
states
which
is
held
the
waiver
the
privilege
is
not
limited
by
the
fact
that
the
defendant's
answer
might
tend
to
establish
guilt
of
a
collateral
offense
for
which
he
could
still
be
prosecuted.
now,
this
to
me
seems
important
does
this
waiver
of
the
privilege
concept
conflict
in
anyway
with
our
comment
rule.
in
other
words,
to
those
rules
hit
head
on
and
i
don't
think
they
do
when
we
consider
the
history
and
the
privilege
underlying
the
privilege.
that
was
detailed
precisely
in
the
court's
griffin
case.
the
court
pointed
out
the
two
main
reasons
policy
considerations
underlying
the
rule
and
the
first
is
that
not
all
people
have
the
ability.
however,
innocent
to
withstand
the
perils
of
the
witness
stand.
and
of
course
in
that
situation,
the
court
noted
that
comment
cuts
down
on
that
right.
now,
it's
really
apparent
that
that's
not
the
situation
here.
the
petitioner
while
represented
by
the
counsel,
the
public
defender's
office
of
sacramento
county
voluntarily
took
the
stand.
now,
they
must
have
waive
the
possibilities
of
relying
upon
the
presumption
of
innocence
or
the
advantages
of
putting
forth
their
versions
of
the
fact
and
of
course
after
weighing
that
decision
was
made
to
take
the
stand.
another
reason
given
in
griffin
is
that
some
defendants,
in
fact
many
defendants
will
not
take
the
stand,
not
that
they
can
explain
the
present
charge
against
them
but
due
to
the
fear
of
impeachment
by
prior
convictions.
that
reason
has
no
validity
here
because
the
petitioner
did
have
prior
convictions;
they
were
alleged
in
the
accusatory
pleading.
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
yes,
sir.
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
no
sir,
i
don't.
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
well,
your
honor
i
thought
about
that
--
i
gave
that
considerable
thought
and
of
course
we
would
take
that
argument
if
we
had
to
but
we
thought
that
this
case
was
so
clear
that
there
might
be
some
--
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
we
thought
that
the
principles
of
waiver
were
so
clear
that
we
would
hit
--
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
well,
as
i
say
that
to
your
statement
is
entirely
in
my
favor
and
it
would
perhaps
i
have
to
take
that
but
we
had
considered
briefing
but
we
didn't
--
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
well,
your
honor
that
--
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
yes,
that
was
waived
but
on
the
fear
of
not
taking
the
stand
because
of
prior
convictions
that
has
no
validity
here
because
two
prior
convictions
were
charged
against
this
petitioner.
he
admitted
them
and
one
was
used
for
impeachment
when
he
did
take
the
stand.
so,
that
fear
could
not
have
the
third
--
the
defendant
from
taking
the
stand.
now,
california
in
this
case
and
in
the
companion
case
of
people
versus
ing
on
the
waiver
principle
followed
the
rule
that
has
been
followed
in
the
federal
courts.
that
is
that
the
waiver
extends
to
permissible
or
relevant
cross-examination.
and
the
court
below
reason
in
this
case
as
it
did
in
the
companion
case
of
ing
that
counts
three
and
four
showed
a
plan,
scheme
in
modus
operandi
and
in
view
of
the
general
denial
as
to
counts
one
and
two
and
when
you
have
a
general
denial
cross-examination
is
extremely
wide
and
goes
to
his
motive,
his
scheme,
his
plan
that
those
counts
three
and
four
were
within
the
scope
of
permissible
cross-examination.
now,
we
counsel
mentioned
that
the
error
of
the
trial
court
in
over
in
sustaining
the
objection
to
cross-examination
and
it
seems
to
conclude
that
some
prejudice
resulted
to
the
petitioner
by
that
ruling,
we
contend
that
that
error
of
the
trial
court
was
an
error
in
favor
of
the
defendant.
the
johnson
case
of
course
points
out
that
where
the
privilege
is
claimed
when
a
witness
takes
his
stand
if
the
privilege
is
claimed.
and
then,
and
granted
as
in
the
johnson
case
and
then
there
is
comment;
of
course
that's
not
playing
the
game
quite
fairly
and
there
would
be
prejudice
but
that
was
certainly
not
the
situation
here.
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
that
is
right.
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
that
is
right.
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
that
is
true,
your
honor.
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
that
is
right.
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
that
is
right.
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
should've
been
allowed
to
be
cross-examined.
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
i
don't
think
they
said
that
your
honor.
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
well,
of
course
i
would
--
the
general
--
i
understand
--
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
that's
right.
that
point
your
honor
--
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
well,
i
don't
know
your
honor.
but
here,
there
was
no
claim
of
privilege.
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
no,
he
--
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
beyond
the
scope
of
direct
examination.
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
so,
you
see
there
and
you
don't
--
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
well,
now
but
you
see
the
prejudice
would
have
to
relate
to
the
factual
situation
your
honor
occurring
then
as
in
johnson
the
witness
or
i
think
it
was
the
defendant
did
claim
a
privilege
which
the
trial
judge
granted.
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
they
didn't
discuss
that.
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
that's
right
and
since
it
is
--
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
well,
i
think
that
that
would
follow.
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
i
think
it
would
follow
that
if
it's
within
the
scope
the
privilege
is
waived
therefore,
he
should've
answered
it.
but
here,
under
the
factual
situation
i
would
say
that
the
error
of
the
trial
court
benefited
the
defendant
because
he
did
not
have
to
attempt
to
explain
what
happened
to
the
--
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
i
don't
recall
on
that.
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
well,
your
honor
his
direct
examination
was
in
on
counts
one
and
two.
certainly,
he
had
made
no
claim
privilege
and
he
was
--
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
that's
right.
then,
when
he
was
asked
a
question
as
to
counts
three
and
four
the
objection
was
on
not
that
you're
going
in
--
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
the
objection
was
made
not
that
you're
requiring
him
to
incriminate
himself
on
a
matter
not
charged
but
you're
going
into
matters
--
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
that's
right.
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
well,
--
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
well,
of
course
--
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
our
california
supreme
court?
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
well,
yes
upon
this
ground
that
was
within
the
scope
of
relevant
cross-examination.
of
course
at
the
time
of
the
trial
justice
white,
griffin
had
been
decided
at
that
time.
so
the
standard
instruction
and
the
comment
was
proper
under
california
law
at
that
time.
what
--
the
way
i
view
the
cross-examination
is
that
since
the
defendant
was
not
required
to
answer
question
which
undoubtedly
would've
been
incriminating
it
was
to
his
benefit.
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
in
any
event
whether
he
took
the
stand
or
not
the
comment
would've
been
permissible
at
the
time
of
the
trial.
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
no,
your
honor.
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
no,
your
honor,
that
language
relates
to
the
judgment
of
the
trial
court
affirming
--
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
no,
your
honor,
when
our
california
supreme
court
grants
a
hearing
it
is
reviewing
the
conviction
of
judgment.
the
case
is
set
aside
of
the
third
district
court
of
appeal.
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
now,
just
on
that
i
might
--
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
so,
as
the
case
stands
before
the
court
today,
all
counts
of
the
conviction
have
been
affirmed.
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
that
would've
been
a
full
explanation,
yes
your
honor.
now,
to
just
on
that
one
point
i
noticed
that
in
the
dissenting
opinion
by
justice
peters
he
and
the
concurring
he
would've
agreed
with
the
fifth
district
court
of
appeals.
now,
counsel
has
made
some
mention
about
some
prejudice
because
of
california's
joinder
provisions
and
just
generally
the
joinder
provisions
provides
that
offenses
connected
together
in
their
commission
or
offenses
of
the
same
class
such
as
here
robbery
against
the
single
defendant
maybe
joined.
and
of
course
that
was
done
in
this
case
and
there
are
some
implications
in
petitioner's
brief
that
this
provision
somehow
cuts
down
on
the
privilege
and
i
don't
think
the
factual
situation
here
--
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
that
is
correct.
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
that
is
true
your
honor
--
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
that
is
true.
that's
my
point
on
the
severance
would
not
have
injury
of
the
defendant
here
and
what
i
mean
by
that
is
this,
just
the
example
if
you
tried
him
first
on
count
one,
evidence
of
the
other
three
counts
would've
come
in
as
collateral
offenses
to
prove
plan
scheme
and
so
forth.
if
he
took
the
stand
this
to
count
one,
then
it
would've
been
the
permissible
of
scope
a
cross-examination
his
privilege
would've
been
waived
and
that
and
even
carrying
further
on
the
second
trial
assuming
for
trial
--
on
the
second
trial.
then
i
would
assume
that
if
his
answer
on
cross-examination
had
been
incriminating
that
could've
been
used
against
him
in
the
second
trial
as
a
judicial
admission.
so
and
one
more
point
on
the
joinder
provision
and
in
cutting
down
on
the
privilege.
you
see
this
--
it's
not
unlimited
for
example
if
this
man
had
been
charged
with
a
robbery
that
had
no
evidentiary
connection
with
another
robbery.
obviously,
it
would've
been
beyond
the
scope
of
cross-examination.
there
could've
been
no
cross-examination
and
of
course
no
comment
by
the
prosecutor
the
privilege
would've
applied.
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
that
is
right
your
honor.
so,
it's
--
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
he
couldn't
--
you
can't
do
that
your
honor
under
--
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
well,
i
can't
think
of
the
california
cases
but
that
has
been
attempted
in
california
and
of
course
that
violation
--
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
that
is
true.
that
is
correct.
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
i
don't
think
that
would
follow
justice
fortas.
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
i
don't
think
so
your
honor
because
of
this;
his
examination
of
this
defendant
of
course
is
within
the
bounds
of
the
relevant
cross-examination.
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
excuse
me,
direct
examination.
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
well,
i
think
that
calling
as
his
own
witness
with
no
doubt
open
up
a
broader
field
than
what
he
had
to
work
with
and
what
he
could
work
with
under
relevant
cross-examination.
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
well,
i
would
say
that
the
waiver
extended
to
counts
three
and
four
because
that
would
be
permissible
cross-examination
and
he
can
do
that
because
the
privilege
is
waived.
now,
i
--
the
procedure,
i
can't
carry
it
on
to
where
he
would
have
a
situation.
i
think
it
would
have
the
situation
where
the
prosecutor
would
then
be
calling
the
defendant
on
the
stand
that
i
just
thought
--
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
that
privilege
has
been
waived
but
it
occurs
to
me
other
things
might
come
into
involvement
there
in
it.
it
seems
to
be
some
what
perhaps
too
coercive
for
a
prosecutor
to
call
the
defendant.
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
well,
that's
not
my
judgment
that
was
the
judgment
of
the
california
supreme
court
on
this
--
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
well,
all
i
could
to
answer
your
question,
all
i
could
say
that
the
privilege
extends
to
counts
three
and
four
under
the
theory
that
that
is
proper
cross-examination.
now,
i
suppose
it
logically
if
everything
else
were
excluded
you
would
have
no
a
different
situation
if
you
wanted
to
call
that
cross-examination
direct
examination.
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
that's
true.
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
and
of
course
that
was
--
our
california
supreme
court
said
that
was
error.
he
should've
allowed
that
cross-examination.
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
no,
there's
a
waiver
of
the
privilege
your
honor
because
it's
within
the
scope
of
cross-examination.
it
was
proper
cross-examination
because
it
showed
his
plan.
a
general
denial
you
see
brings
in
the
collateral
matters.
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
your
honor
i
would
think
that
if
logically
if
you
can
insulate
it
to
this
cross-examination
waiver
problem,
it
will
logically
follow
perhaps
but
as
i
mentioned
so
many
other
aspects
of
calling
the
defendant
would
--
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
your
honor,
that
has
not
been
the
history
of
the
situation
in
the
federal
practice.
this
principle
of
waiver
as
to
the
extent
of
permissible
cross-examination
caminetti,
i
think
was
decided
in
1917
and
no
one
is
contended
that
under
the
caminetti
principles
are
i
know
of
no
federal
prosecutor
thus
contended
that
by
virtue
of
his
waiver
he
can
then
put
them
on
the
stand.
one
final
word,
assuming
a
griffin
error
i
would
ask
you
to
consider
that
this
is
a
situation
where
chapman
could
apply.
the
comment
here
was
not
extensive
as
in
chapman;
considered
in
the
light
of
the
situation
that
he
did
take
the
stand
and
the
jury
could
draw
their
own
conclusions
without
a
situation
in
griffin
without
being
aided
by
the
prosecutor
in
the
court.
i
think
it
points
to
the
conclusion
that
the
error
of
any
was
harmless
beyond
to
reasonable
doubt
and
we
would
submit
that
california
decision
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
well,
some
of
the
earlier
federal
cases
seem
to
indicate
that
the
waiver
of
the
privilege
was
not
bounded
by
the
scope
of
cross-examination.
caminetti
indicates
that
some
of
the
later
cases
in
the
federal
courts
johnson
and
the
brown
case
and
so
forth
would
indicate
that
it
is
tightened
that
the
waiver
the
privilege
extends
only
to
the
scope
of
relevant
cross-examination.
if
those
cases
were
followed
then
of
course
and
it
was
not
connected
crime
then,
griffin
would
be
violated.
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
i
would
say
that
it
would
be
perhaps
broader
for
the
ordinary
witness
because
since
he
is
not
charged.
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
an
uncharged
witness?
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
no,
no
your
honor,
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
well,
that
is
true.
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
well,
what
i
meant
was
that
the
non-charged
witness
his
privilege
or
he
can
be
questioned
about
many
things
in
a
much
broader
area
because
he
is
not
charged
and
i
think
that
the
privileges
would
work
differently
between
the
non-charged
witness
and
the
charged
witness
that
in
your
--
if
i
made
myself
clear.
my
time
is
up
your
honor.
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
your
honor,
i
think
it's
the
theory;
the
non-charged
witness
is
not
being
--
you're
not
proving
anything
against
him
but
as
with
the
defendant
here,
you're
proving
a
defense
against
him
and
when
he
makes
a
general
denial
he
has
an
effect
denied
the
collateral
offense
of
count
three
and
four.
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
no.
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
that
is
true
but
because
of
that
general
denial
under
the
rules
of
evidence,
he
makes
a
general
denial
also
of
counts
three
and
four
and
therefore,
within
the
scope
of
cross-examination.
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
no,
i'm
sorry
your
honor.
i
mean
that
california
court
didn't
hold
that
and
as
my
illustration
was
if
he
had
no
evidentiary
connection
between
a
robbery
you
couldn't
cross-examine
in
order
he
would
not
have
waived
his
privilege,
that's
the
holding
below.
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
well,
--
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
well,
i
have
a
chart
here
and
just
running
across
they
were
similar
because
of
clothing,
because
at
all
counts
they
searched
other
areas
looking
for
other
things
such
as
the
radio
in
count
two,
credit
cards
in
count
one,
and
in
counts
three
and
four
they
also
search
to
other
areas
they
were
in
all
of
the
offenses;
they
were
some
type
or
use
some
type
of
mask
but
i
think
most
significant
of
all
is
that
you
had
the
admitted
robber
david
perez
unrelated
to
this
provision.
you
had
him
as
a
confessed
robber
in
count
two
and
counts
three
and
four
and
the
evidence
showed
that
he
and
that
was
used
in
the
haston
case
as
a
significant
similar
mark
where
the
admitted
robber
is
present
at
the
uncharged
and
charged
crime
as
showing
plan
scheme.
thank
you.
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
we
have
the
california
comment
rule
here
again
to
day
but
under
much
different
circumstances
and
presented
in
griffin
and
in
the
chapman
case.
in
griffin,
as
you
recall
the
defendant
did
not
testify
and
it
was
there
held
that
that
part
of
the
comment
rule
of
california
which
permitted
comment
by
the
prosecutor
and
a
standard
instruction
by
the
court
cut
down
and
violated
his
fifth
amendment
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
now,
today,
we
have
the
other
side
of
the
coin
as
it
were
of
our
comment
rule.
our
california
constitution
permits
comment
in
those
situations
as
here
where
he
does
take
the
stand
and
fails
to
explain
evidence
--
fails
to
explain
or
deny
evidence
within
his
knowledge.
now,
it
is
respondent's
position
that
the
privilege
does
not
apply
and
the
california
comment
rule
is
valid
here
in
this
situation
where
he
does
take
the
stand
but
fails
to
explain
or
deny
facts
within
his
knowledge.
we
think
this
conclusion
follows
from
the
proposition
and
the
many
cases
that
by
taking
the
stand
voluntarily
as
here
he
waives
his
right
--
he
waives
his
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
the
waiver
of
course
under
the
holding
below
is
not
unlimited.
the
waiver
in
this
case
and
in
the
many
federal
cases
is
cited
in
our
brief
is
determined
by
the
scope
of
relevant
cross-examination.
the
landmark
case
of
course
cited
in
our
brief
is
caminetti
that
has
been
followed
in
such
leading
cases
as
johnson
versus
the
united
states
which
is
held
the
waiver
the
privilege
is
not
limited
by
the
fact
that
the
defendant's
answer
might
tend
to
establish
guilt
of
a
collateral
offense
for
which
he
could
still
be
prosecuted.
now,
this
to
me
seems
important
does
this
waiver
of
the
privilege
concept
conflict
in
anyway
with
our
comment
rule.
in
other
words,
to
those
rules
hit
head
on
and
i
don't
think
they
do
when
we
consider
the
history
and
the
privilege
underlying
the
privilege.
that
was
detailed
precisely
in
the
court's
griffin
case.
the
court
pointed
out
the
two
main
reasons
policy
considerations
underlying
the
rule
and
the
first
is
that
not
all
people
have
the
ability.
however,
innocent
to
withstand
the
perils
of
the
witness
stand.
and
of
course
in
that
situation,
the
court
noted
that
comment
cuts
down
on
that
right.
now,
it's
really
apparent
that
that's
not
the
situation
here.
the
petitioner
while
represented
by
the
counsel,
the
public
defender's
office
of
sacramento
county
voluntarily
took
the
stand.
now,
they
must
have
waive
the
possibilities
of
relying
upon
the
presumption
of
innocence
or
the
advantages
of
putting
forth
their
versions
of
the
fact
and
of
course
after
weighing
that
decision
was
made
to
take
the
stand.
another
reason
given
in
griffin
is
that
some
defendants,
in
fact
many
defendants
will
not
take
the
stand,
not
that
they
can
explain
the
present
charge
against
them
but
due
to
the
fear
of
impeachment
by
prior
convictions.
that
reason
has
no
validity
here
because
the
petitioner
did
have
prior
convictions;
they
were
alleged
in
the
accusatory
pleading.
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
yes,
sir.
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
no
sir,
i
don't.
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
well,
your
honor
i
thought
about
that
--
i
gave
that
considerable
thought
and
of
course
we
would
take
that
argument
if
we
had
to
but
we
thought
that
this
case
was
so
clear
that
there
might
be
some
--
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
we
thought
that
the
principles
of
waiver
were
so
clear
that
we
would
hit
--
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
well,
as
i
say
that
to
your
statement
is
entirely
in
my
favor
and
it
would
perhaps
i
have
to
take
that
but
we
had
considered
briefing
but
we
didn't
--
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
well,
your
honor
that
--
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
yes,
that
was
waived
but
on
the
fear
of
not
taking
the
stand
because
of
prior
convictions
that
has
no
validity
here
because
two
prior
convictions
were
charged
against
this
petitioner.
he
admitted
them
and
one
was
used
for
impeachment
when
he
did
take
the
stand.
so,
that
fear
could
not
have
the
third
--
the
defendant
from
taking
the
stand.
now,
california
in
this
case
and
in
the
companion
case
of
people
versus
ing
on
the
waiver
principle
followed
the
rule
that
has
been
followed
in
the
federal
courts.
that
is
that
the
waiver
extends
to
permissible
or
relevant
cross-examination.
and
the
court
below
reason
in
this
case
as
it
did
in
the
companion
case
of
ing
that
counts
three
and
four
showed
a
plan,
scheme
in
modus
operandi
and
in
view
of
the
general
denial
as
to
counts
one
and
two
and
when
you
have
a
general
denial
cross-examination
is
extremely
wide
and
goes
to
his
motive,
his
scheme,
his
plan
that
those
counts
three
and
four
were
within
the
scope
of
permissible
cross-examination.
now,
we
counsel
mentioned
that
the
error
of
the
trial
court
in
over
in
sustaining
the
objection
to
cross-examination
and
it
seems
to
conclude
that
some
prejudice
resulted
to
the
petitioner
by
that
ruling,
we
contend
that
that
error
of
the
trial
court
was
an
error
in
favor
of
the
defendant.
the
johnson
case
of
course
points
out
that
where
the
privilege
is
claimed
when
a
witness
takes
his
stand
if
the
privilege
is
claimed.
and
then,
and
granted
as
in
the
johnson
case
and
then
there
is
comment;
of
course
that's
not
playing
the
game
quite
fairly
and
there
would
be
prejudice
but
that
was
certainly
not
the
situation
here.
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
that
is
right.
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
that
is
right.
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
that
is
true,
your
honor.
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
that
is
right.
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
that
is
right.
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
should've
been
allowed
to
be
cross-examined.
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
i
don't
think
they
said
that
your
honor.
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
well,
of
course
i
would
--
the
general
--
i
understand
--
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
that's
right.
that
point
your
honor
--
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
well,
i
don't
know
your
honor.
but
here,
there
was
no
claim
of
privilege.
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
no,
he
--
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
beyond
the
scope
of
direct
examination.
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
so,
you
see
there
and
you
don't
--
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
well,
now
but
you
see
the
prejudice
would
have
to
relate
to
the
factual
situation
your
honor
occurring
then
as
in
johnson
the
witness
or
i
think
it
was
the
defendant
did
claim
a
privilege
which
the
trial
judge
granted.
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
they
didn't
discuss
that.
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
that's
right
and
since
it
is
--
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
well,
i
think
that
that
would
follow.
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
i
think
it
would
follow
that
if
it's
within
the
scope
the
privilege
is
waived
therefore,
he
should've
answered
it.
but
here,
under
the
factual
situation
i
would
say
that
the
error
of
the
trial
court
benefited
the
defendant
because
he
did
not
have
to
attempt
to
explain
what
happened
to
the
--
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
i
don't
recall
on
that.
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
well,
your
honor
his
direct
examination
was
in
on
counts
one
and
two.
certainly,
he
had
made
no
claim
privilege
and
he
was
--
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
that's
right.
then,
when
he
was
asked
a
question
as
to
counts
three
and
four
the
objection
was
on
not
that
you're
going
in
--
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
the
objection
was
made
not
that
you're
requiring
him
to
incriminate
himself
on
a
matter
not
charged
but
you're
going
into
matters
--
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
that's
right.
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
well,
--
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
well,
of
course
--
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
our
california
supreme
court?
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
well,
yes
upon
this
ground
that
was
within
the
scope
of
relevant
cross-examination.
of
course
at
the
time
of
the
trial
justice
white,
griffin
had
been
decided
at
that
time.
so
the
standard
instruction
and
the
comment
was
proper
under
california
law
at
that
time.
what
--
the
way
i
view
the
cross-examination
is
that
since
the
defendant
was
not
required
to
answer
question
which
undoubtedly
would've
been
incriminating
it
was
to
his
benefit.
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
in
any
event
whether
he
took
the
stand
or
not
the
comment
would've
been
permissible
at
the
time
of
the
trial.
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
no,
your
honor.
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
no,
your
honor,
that
language
relates
to
the
judgment
of
the
trial
court
affirming
--
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
no,
your
honor,
when
our
california
supreme
court
grants
a
hearing
it
is
reviewing
the
conviction
of
judgment.
the
case
is
set
aside
of
the
third
district
court
of
appeal.
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
now,
just
on
that
i
might
--
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
so,
as
the
case
stands
before
the
court
today,
all
counts
of
the
conviction
have
been
affirmed.
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
that
would've
been
a
full
explanation,
yes
your
honor.
now,
to
just
on
that
one
point
i
noticed
that
in
the
dissenting
opinion
by
justice
peters
he
and
the
concurring
he
would've
agreed
with
the
fifth
district
court
of
appeals.
now,
counsel
has
made
some
mention
about
some
prejudice
because
of
california's
joinder
provisions
and
just
generally
the
joinder
provisions
provides
that
offenses
connected
together
in
their
commission
or
offenses
of
the
same
class
such
as
here
robbery
against
the
single
defendant
maybe
joined.
and
of
course
that
was
done
in
this
case
and
there
are
some
implications
in
petitioner's
brief
that
this
provision
somehow
cuts
down
on
the
privilege
and
i
don't
think
the
factual
situation
here
--
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
that
is
correct.
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
that
is
true
your
honor
--
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
that
is
true.
that's
my
point
on
the
severance
would
not
have
injury
of
the
defendant
here
and
what
i
mean
by
that
is
this,
just
the
example
if
you
tried
him
first
on
count
one,
evidence
of
the
other
three
counts
would've
come
in
as
collateral
offenses
to
prove
plan
scheme
and
so
forth.
if
he
took
the
stand
this
to
count
one,
then
it
would've
been
the
permissible
of
scope
a
cross-examination
his
privilege
would've
been
waived
and
that
and
even
carrying
further
on
the
second
trial
assuming
for
trial
--
on
the
second
trial.
then
i
would
assume
that
if
his
answer
on
cross-examination
had
been
incriminating
that
could've
been
used
against
him
in
the
second
trial
as
a
judicial
admission.
so
and
one
more
point
on
the
joinder
provision
and
in
cutting
down
on
the
privilege.
you
see
this
--
it's
not
unlimited
for
example
if
this
man
had
been
charged
with
a
robbery
that
had
no
evidentiary
connection
with
another
robbery.
obviously,
it
would've
been
beyond
the
scope
of
cross-examination.
there
could've
been
no
cross-examination
and
of
course
no
comment
by
the
prosecutor
the
privilege
would've
applied.
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
that
is
right
your
honor.
so,
it's
--
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
he
couldn't
--
you
can't
do
that
your
honor
under
--
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
well,
i
can't
think
of
the
california
cases
but
that
has
been
attempted
in
california
and
of
course
that
violation
--
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
that
is
true.
that
is
correct.
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
i
don't
think
that
would
follow
justice
fortas.
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
i
don't
think
so
your
honor
because
of
this;
his
examination
of
this
defendant
of
course
is
within
the
bounds
of
the
relevant
cross-examination.
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
excuse
me,
direct
examination.
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
well,
i
think
that
calling
as
his
own
witness
with
no
doubt
open
up
a
broader
field
than
what
he
had
to
work
with
and
what
he
could
work
with
under
relevant
cross-examination.
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
well,
i
would
say
that
the
waiver
extended
to
counts
three
and
four
because
that
would
be
permissible
cross-examination
and
he
can
do
that
because
the
privilege
is
waived.
now,
i
--
the
procedure,
i
can't
carry
it
on
to
where
he
would
have
a
situation.
i
think
it
would
have
the
situation
where
the
prosecutor
would
then
be
calling
the
defendant
on
the
stand
that
i
just
thought
--
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
that
privilege
has
been
waived
but
it
occurs
to
me
other
things
might
come
into
involvement
there
in
it.
it
seems
to
be
some
what
perhaps
too
coercive
for
a
prosecutor
to
call
the
defendant.
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
well,
that's
not
my
judgment
that
was
the
judgment
of
the
california
supreme
court
on
this
--
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
well,
all
i
could
to
answer
your
question,
all
i
could
say
that
the
privilege
extends
to
counts
three
and
four
under
the
theory
that
that
is
proper
cross-examination.
now,
i
suppose
it
logically
if
everything
else
were
excluded
you
would
have
no
a
different
situation
if
you
wanted
to
call
that
cross-examination
direct
examination.
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
that's
true.
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
and
of
course
that
was
--
our
california
supreme
court
said
that
was
error.
he
should've
allowed
that
cross-examination.
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
no,
there's
a
waiver
of
the
privilege
your
honor
because
it's
within
the
scope
of
cross-examination.
it
was
proper
cross-examination
because
it
showed
his
plan.
a
general
denial
you
see
brings
in
the
collateral
matters.
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
your
honor
i
would
think
that
if
logically
if
you
can
insulate
it
to
this
cross-examination
waiver
problem,
it
will
logically
follow
perhaps
but
as
i
mentioned
so
many
other
aspects
of
calling
the
defendant
would
--
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
your
honor,
that
has
not
been
the
history
of
the
situation
in
the
federal
practice.
this
principle
of
waiver
as
to
the
extent
of
permissible
cross-examination
caminetti,
i
think
was
decided
in
1917
and
no
one
is
contended
that
under
the
caminetti
principles
are
i
know
of
no
federal
prosecutor
thus
contended
that
by
virtue
of
his
waiver
he
can
then
put
them
on
the
stand.
one
final
word,
assuming
a
griffin
error
i
would
ask
you
to
consider
that
this
is
a
situation
where
chapman
could
apply.
the
comment
here
was
not
extensive
as
in
chapman;
considered
in
the
light
of
the
situation
that
he
did
take
the
stand
and
the
jury
could
draw
their
own
conclusions
without
a
situation
in
griffin
without
being
aided
by
the
prosecutor
in
the
court.
i
think
it
points
to
the
conclusion
that
the
error
of
any
was
harmless
beyond
to
reasonable
doubt
and
we
would
submit
that
california
decision
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
well,
some
of
the
earlier
federal
cases
seem
to
indicate
that
the
waiver
of
the
privilege
was
not
bounded
by
the
scope
of
cross-examination.
caminetti
indicates
that
some
of
the
later
cases
in
the
federal
courts
johnson
and
the
brown
case
and
so
forth
would
indicate
that
it
is
tightened
that
the
waiver
the
privilege
extends
only
to
the
scope
of
relevant
cross-examination.
if
those
cases
were
followed
then
of
course
and
it
was
not
connected
crime
then,
griffin
would
be
violated.
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
i
would
say
that
it
would
be
perhaps
broader
for
the
ordinary
witness
because
since
he
is
not
charged.
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
an
uncharged
witness?
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
no,
no
your
honor,
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
well,
that
is
true.
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
well,
what
i
meant
was
that
the
non-charged
witness
his
privilege
or
he
can
be
questioned
about
many
things
in
a
much
broader
area
because
he
is
not
charged
and
i
think
that
the
privileges
would
work
differently
between
the
non-charged
witness
and
the
charged
witness
that
in
your
--
if
i
made
myself
clear.
my
time
is
up
your
honor.
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
your
honor,
i
think
it's
the
theory;
the
non-charged
witness
is
not
being
--
you're
not
proving
anything
against
him
but
as
with
the
defendant
here,
you're
proving
a
defense
against
him
and
when
he
makes
a
general
denial
he
has
an
effect
denied
the
collateral
offense
of
count
three
and
four.
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
no.
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
that
is
true
but
because
of
that
general
denial
under
the
rules
of
evidence,
he
makes
a
general
denial
also
of
counts
three
and
four
and
therefore,
within
the
scope
of
cross-examination.
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
no,
i'm
sorry
your
honor.
i
mean
that
california
court
didn't
hold
that
and
as
my
illustration
was
if
he
had
no
evidentiary
connection
between
a
robbery
you
couldn't
cross-examine
in
order
he
would
not
have
waived
his
privilege,
that's
the
holding
below.
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
well,
--
mr.
edsel
w.
haws
well,
i
have
a
chart
here
and
just
running
across
they
were
similar
because
of
clothing,
because
at
all
counts
they
searched
other
areas
looking
for
other
things
such
as
the
radio
in
count
two,
credit
cards
in
count
one,
and
in
counts
three
and
four
they
also
search
to
other
areas
they
were
in
all
of
the
offenses;
they
were
some
type
or
use
some
type
of
mask
but
i
think
most
significant
of
all
is
that
you
had
the
admitted
robber
david
perez
unrelated
to
this
provision.
you
had
him
as
a
confessed
robber
in
count
two
and
counts
three
and
four
and
the
evidence
showed
that
he
and
that
was
used
in
the
haston
case
as
a
significant
similar
mark
where
the
admitted
robber
is
present
at
the
uncharged
and
charged
crime
as
showing
plan
scheme.
thank
you.
