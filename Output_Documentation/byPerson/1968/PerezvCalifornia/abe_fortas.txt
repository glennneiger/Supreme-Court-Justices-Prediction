justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
suppose
that
here
in
your
theory
that
there
was
a
waiver
as
to
counts
three
and
four
where
prosecutor
could've
said,
“all
right,
i'll
now
examine
him
as
i
examine
the
petitioner
as
my
own
witness.”
justice
abe
fortas
why?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
see
in
your
theory
is
that
as
i
understand
it
that
there
was
a
waiver
of
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
as
to
counts
three
and
four
as
well
as
to
counts
one
and
two,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
the
court
excluded
cross-examination
as
to
counts
three
and
four
on
the
evidentiary
basis
that
that
cross-examination
would
be
beyond
the
scope
of
the
direct,
that's
right
isn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
does
it
follow
that
the
prosecutor
--
the
privilege
having
been
waived
could
have
made
the
petitioner
his
own
witness
and
proceeded
to
examine
him
with
respect
to
counts
three
and
four?
justice
abe
fortas
and
i
don't
understand
because
it
seems
to
me
that's
necessary
logic
of
your
position,
it's
a
necessary
consequence
of
saying
that
testimony
as
to
counts
one
and
two
resulted
in
a
waiver
of
the
privilege
as
to
counts
three
and
four.
justice
abe
fortas
of
the
relevant
direct
examination.
justice
abe
fortas
but
why,
why
couldn't
he
--
if
the
privilege
is
waive,
why
couldn't
he
call
petitioner
as
his
own
witness,
why
couldn't
the
prosecutor
call
petitioner
as
his
own
witness,
does
it
call
john
jones
on
your
theory
that
the
privilege
was
waived?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
then
don't
you
have
to
say
that
privilege
was
not
waived
as
to
counts
three
and
four?
so
if
the
privilege
was
waived
as
to
counts
three
and
four,
the
prosecutor
presumably
could
put
petitioner
on
the
stand,
petitioner
being
by
hypothesis
in
possession
of
relevant
information.
and
he
could
then
examine
it
on
direct
as
his
own
witness
as
the
state's
own
witness
privileges
were
waived.
justice
abe
fortas
that's
right
and
if
the
privilege
has
been
waived
why
can't
he?
justice
abe
fortas
i
know
but
that's
a
valued
judgment
if
you
think
that's
too
coercive
whether
that's
a
little
inconsistent
with
your
position.
justice
abe
fortas
but
the
problem
here
is
whether
offhand
it
seems
that
the
trial
court
took
position
and
maybe
somewhat
inconsistent
if
or
let
me
put
it
this
way;
that
if
the
prosecutor
had
said,
“privilege
has
now
been
waived,
defendant
testified
as
to
counts
one
and
two.
privilege
has
been
waived
as
to
counts
three
and
four.
i
will
now
make
the
defendant
my
own
witness
and
i
will
direct
some
questions
to
him.”
i
failed
unless
you
--
some
rule
in
california
which
i'm
unaware,
i
don't
why
that
isn't
the
necessary
logical
result
of
a
waiver
of
the
privilege
if
you're
right
that
the
privilege
was
waived
as
to
counts
three
and
four?
justice
abe
fortas
no,
but
the
court
didn't
allow
to
examine
as
to
counts
three
and
four
to
cross-examine
as
to
counts
three
and
four
--
justice
abe
fortas
that
was
outside
of
the
scope
of
the
direct.
justice
abe
fortas
on
the
grounds
that
there
was
a
waiver
of
the
privilege?
justice
abe
fortas
yes
and
i
see
what
you
mean
but
i
still
i
suggest
to
you
that
if
it
is
your
contention
that
the
privilege
was
waived,
that
would
open
up
the
defendant
to
being
called
as
--
by
the
state
if
the
state
want
to
do
it
and
examine
it
with
respect
to
the
entire
scope
of
counts
three
and
four.
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that
but
i
mean
to
say
we
have
to
look
at
this
thing
as
a
matter
of
principle,
not
to
look
at
the
parameter
of
the
problem
as
well
as
its
immediate
focus
and
i
suggest
to
you
that
what
you're
telling
us
is
that
may
result
in
the
logical

that

a
defendant

as

any

as
a

and
the
net
result
of
that
is
that
the
prosecutor
if

examine
the

and
examine
the
defendant

with
