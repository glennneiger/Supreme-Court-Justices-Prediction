justice
potter
stewart
mr.
fetros,
--
justice
potter
stewart
there
is
a
statement
in
your
brief
that
is
not
quite
clear
to
me
on
page
6.
you're
talking
about
the
sentence
that
was
imposed
upon
your
client
to
say
that
the
counts
one
and
two
to
run
consecutively
and
counts
three
and
four
concurrently.
now,
does
that
mean
the
three
and
four
were
consecutive
to
one
and
two
but
concurrently
with
each
other
or
does
it
mean
that
they
were
concurrently
with
counts
one
and
two?
justice
potter
stewart
so
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
of
count
two
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
counts
three
and
four
where
the
sentence
is
imposed
were
fully
concurrent
with
the
consecutive
sentences
imposed
upon
counts
one
and
two?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
on
sentence
on
counts
three
and
four
would
never
end
later
than
on
one
and
two
under
this
sentence?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
suppose
the
parole
board
could
consider
anything
including
the
fact
he
was
accused
of
other
crimes?
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
may
i
ask
what
is
the
relief
you're
asking
for?
which
convictions
are
you
asking
us
to
set
aside?
justice
potter
stewart
only
three
and
four?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
what
if
only
three
and
four
then
he
remains
in
jail
and
one
and
two
does
not.
justice
potter
stewart
oh!
i
beg
your
pardon.
justice
potter
stewart
but
you're
not
asking
us
to
set
aside?
justice
potter
stewart
oh,
you
are!
justice
potter
stewart
you
want
all
four
convictions?
justice
potter
stewart
but
that
of
course
if
everybody
realizes
that
then
the
jury
can
be
assumed
to
realize
that
too?
that's
correct.
justice
potter
stewart
because
he
had
this
--
he
has
a
lawyer
and
if
the
lawyer
is
representing
him
he
can
make
all
this.
what
you're
making
clear
to
us;
he
can
make
clear
to
the
jury.
it's
a
matter
of
just
the
factual
realities
of
life.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
haws,
i'm
having
a
little
trouble
in
finding
--
satisfying
myself
what
happened
here
in
the
california
appellate
court.
i'm
looking
at
page
11
of
the
appendix
where
there
appears
what
purports
to
be
an
opinion
of
the
district
court
of
appeals
the
fifth
appellate
district
which,
if
you
must
go
on
page
22
includes
by
saying
the
judgment
is
affirmed
as
to
count
one
and
two
of
the
information
and
reversed
as
to
counts
three
and
four.
and
there
then
follows
beginning
on
page
23
what
appears
to
be
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
california
which
ends
up
on
page
29.
the
judgment
is
affirmed
and
does
that
mean
that
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
of
appeal
affirming
as
to
counts
one
and
two
reversing
as
to
counts
three
and
four
is
affirmed.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
what
it
seems
to
say.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that
wasn't
the
judgment
was
it
that
the
supreme
court
of
california
was
reviewing.
it
was
reviewing
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
of
appeals?
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
do
i
need
a
gettysburg's
opinion
directly
in
reading
it
to
say
in
effect
that
all
of
the
evidence
on
counts
three
and
four
as
a
matter
of
california
law
were
admissible
on
the
charges
under
counts
one
and
two
as
part
of
the
modus
operandi?
justice
potter
stewart
so
that
it
was
all
--
if
they've
never
been
at
counts
three
and
four,
isn't
never
been
that
evidence
nevertheless
would've
been
admissible
in
the
trial
on
counts
one
and
two.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that's
what
he
said
and
that's
(voice
overlap).
justice
potter
stewart
because
there
would
have
been
no
waiver
with
respect?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
fetros,
--
justice

there

so

--
justice

stewart
of

--
justice

stewart
--
counts
three

where
the
