in
this

in
the
superior
court
and
new
jersey
supreme
court,
am
i

my
problem
of
course,
my
personal
problem,
my
son
is
an
attorney
general
and
i
just
like
to
be
sure
whether
i'm
qualified
--
disqualified?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
have
they
raised
up
petition
for
certification?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
on
the
posture
here
is
that
the
new
jersey's
supreme
court
has
decided
a
federal
constitutional
question.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
whether,
whatever
or
however?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
they
have
decided
it,
have
they?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
thought
mr.
trimble
that
mr.
marsh
conceded
that
this
new
legislation
didn't
overrule
the
supreme
court
decision
for
the
years
to
which
that
decision
apply,
but
simply
amended
the
statute
to
provide
the
exemption
for
the
future.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
ceded
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
but
you're
not
suggesting
are
you
that
exemptions
are
not
subject
to
constitutional
restraints?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
tax
exemptions
generally
are.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
the
states
are
free
to
discriminate
for
example
in
the
granting
exemptions,
without
regard
to
the
federal
constitutional
restraint?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
thought
you
say
mr.
marsh
that
the
new
statute
had
no
retroactive
application
that's
why
you
didn't
