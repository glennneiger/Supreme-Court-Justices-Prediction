mr.

chief
justice
earl
warren
you
have
no
quarrel
with
this
amended
statute.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
marsh,
i
understand
when
you
say
that
you're
perfectly
satisfied
with
the
new
law
as
it
stands
in
the
present
time
so
far
as
two
or
three
years.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
you're
satisfied
with
that.
now
may
i
ask
you
this,
do
in
this
case
would
you
have
complied,
been
in
compliance
with
the
present
law
at
the
time
this
case
arose?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
i
didn't
ask
you
that.
i
merely
asked
you
as
a
matter
of
fact,
if
in
this
case
you
would
have
been
in
compliance
with
the
present
law,
if
it
had
existed
at
that
time?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
would.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
so
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
consider
this
new
legislation
as
overruling
the
supreme
court
of
new
jersey
in
your
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
trimble.
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
our
review
of
state
case
have
we
ever
said
that
that
the
constitutional
question
must
be
raised
in
the
lowest
court
where,
it
became
pertinent
or
have
we
merely
said
that
“it
is
an
adequate
state
ground
for
not
deciding
the
federal
question.”
if
the
state
holds
that
they
did
not
properly
raise
it
the
first
time,
it
was
available
to
them.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
what
i
felt.
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
the
amended
statute
a
repeal
of
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
decision
or
is
it
a
clarification
of
the
act,
the
original
act.
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
do
you
make
the
differentiation
as
to
whether
it
was
repeal
or
barely
clarification
of
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
you
have
an
agency
or
an
officer
in
new
jersey
who
is
responsible
for
supervising
the
nonprofit
corporations
as
they
do
in
some
states.
in
my
own
state,
the
attorney
general
is
charged
with
the
responsibility
of
supervising
the
nonprofit
corporations.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
don't
mean
for
tax.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
to
determine,
for
instance
to
determine
whether
they
are
actually
carrying
out
their
educational
activities
or
whether
they're
using
it
as
a
cover-up
for
something
else.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
don't
think
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
think
the
order
of
our
argument
is
that
you
complete
you're
argument
now,
and
mr.
marsh
then
conclude
his.
