mr.
john
w.
trimble
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
john
w.
trimble
the
attorney
general,
your
honor
was
never
in
this
matter.
he
let
me
carry
the
ball
through
all
the
courts
and
filed
a
statement
that
in
lieu
of
a
brief
that
he
felt
that
the
situation
was
being
adequately
argued
by
the
borough
of
glassboro
and
therefore
he
would
not
participate.
the
situation
is
that
the
state
of
new
jersey
--
mr.
john
w.
trimble
well,
they
have
entered
their
appearance
for
the
state
of
new
jersey
but
they've
only
entered
a
statement
in
lieu
of
a
brief.
and
appeared
that
none
of
hearings
to
argue
is
a
matter
and
throughout
all
the
record
you'll
see
that
the
deputy
attorney
general's
name
is
listed
there
but
never
appeared.
this
is
one
of
the
problems
faced
in
this
matters
that
the
state
of
new
jersey
of
course
receives
and
none
of
this
taxes.
this
is
a
law
of
course
passed
by
the
new
jersey
legislature.
where
the
tax
situation
as
i'm
sure
you're
aware
of
in
new
jersey
it's
for
the
local,
a
local
purpose
for
the
fire
protection
and
police
protection
for
the
local
municipalities.
none
of
this
money
ever
inures
to
the
state
of
new
jersey
and
since
the
borough
of
glassboro
the
one
interested
in
this
matter.
we
of
course
carried
the
ball
through
the
fight
and
the
upholding
the
state
statute
on
this
matter.
now
the
--
in
addition
to
the
facts
that
were
set
forth
by
the
appellant
i'd
like
to
add
that
the
channel
12,
whyy
never
applied
for
an
exemption
under
the
statute
54:4-4.4.
this
was
not
handled
in
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
because
they
felt
they
didn't
have
to
handle
that
they've
upheld
the
statute
so
therefore
they
did
not
consider
this
point.
the
reason
this
may
be
very
important
is
that
the
procedure
is
set
forth
where
a
form
is
filled
out
for
the
tax
assessor
to
review
the
statements
by
someone
claiming
the
exemption
and
why
they
should
be
exempt.
the
record
is
clear
that
the
borough
was
put
on
noticed,
a
letter
was
sent
by
this
attorney
for
the
television
station
asking
for
an
exemption,
which
was
referred
to
the
local
solicitor
who
then
referred
to
the
states
statute
and
says,
you're
not
exempt
because
under
the
new
jersey
statute
which
is
set
forth
in
the
appendix
on
page
17
the
section
which
excluded
them
of
course
and
which
was
the
argument
i
might
say
all
through
the
new
jersey
courts
up
into
the
supreme
court
that
the
foregoing
exemptions
shall
apply
only
when
the
association,
corporation
or
institution
claiming
the
exemption
owns
the
property
in
question
that
is
incorporated,
were
organized
under
the
laws
of
this
state,
and
authorized
to
carry
out
the
purposes
on
account
of
which
the
exemption
is
claimed.
we
agree
that
this
channel
12
is
a
nonprofit
corporation.
there's
no
question
that
they
comply
in
every
way
with
what
new
jersey
would
consider
a
nonprofit
corporation
that
is
not
our
argument
today.
the
situation
is
that
the
borough
of
glassboro
has
filed
the
law
in
new
jersey
by
denying
this
exemption.
we
had
to
list
this
over
a
hundred
thousand
dollars
of
ratables
both
real
and
personal
on
our
books.
the
local
citizens
had
to
pay
these
taxes
because
we
have
the
county
government
that
relies
on
what
you
access
on
your
local
municipalities
to
run
the
county
government
in
gloucester
county
which
glassboro
situate.
now
they
have
been
paying
these
taxes
and
they
have
to
make
up
this
deficit
every
year,
which
now
amounts
to
a
sum
of
$60,000.00.
it
is
true
we
are
only
arguing
back
taxes
now.
the
new
act
that
became
effective
january
1,
1968
and
i
might
say
the
same
question
was
raised
by
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
whether
this
was
a
--
an
act
to
clarify
the
existing
law
or
was
it
a
modification
to
carry
on
after
january
1st.
and
i
might
only
add
that
the
law
firm
that
was
handling
the
matter
in
the
state
level
was
from
a
law
firm
where
the
senators
sponsored
the
bill.
so
i
think
it's
safe
to
say
that
it
was
not
a
declaratory
act
but
it
was
an
act
to
amend
54:4-3.6
and
to
carry
on
after
1st
of
january.
mr.
john
w.
trimble
the
new
act
simply
says
that
nonprofit
corporations
whether
they
be
domestic
or
foreign
or
exempt
under
i
think
the
new
citation
is
3.6
(a)
or
something.
it
just
includes
them
in
there
domestic
or
foreign
corporations
are
included
in
the
exemption
of
the
section.
down
at
it's
--
the
taxes
as
i
said
amount
to
approximately
$60,000.00.
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to
the
procedural
point
here
that
the
fact
that
the
federal
issue
was
never
raised
in
this
matter
to
all
the
supreme
court
in
new
jersey.
and
it
might
not
have
been
raised
then,
had
it
not
been
for
the
fact
that
the
appellate
division
of
the
superior
court
was
unanimous
in
upholding
the
statute
as
it
was
argued.
because
it
was
argued
that
by
channel
12
that
they
are
organized
under
the
laws
of
new
jersey
because
they
qualified
--
because
they
had
a
registered
agent
in
the
state
that
could
be
served,
service
of
process.
so
therefore,
they
were
“organized”.
of
course,
the
word
“organized”
as
shown
in
the
opinions
of
the
superior
court
appellate
division
and
the
state
supreme
court,
new
jersey
state
supreme
court
meant
that
it
dealt
with
organizations
such
as
religious
organizations
that
are
not
incorporated
but
nevertheless
are
organized
in
new
jersey
and
are
available
for
the
exemption.
this
is
the
argument
that
prevailed
to
the
supreme
court
then
the
appellant
in
this
matter
was
faced
with
a
problem
on
how
to
get
into
the
supreme
court.
because
there
was
no
dissent
in
the
appellate
division
and
no
constitutional
issue
raised.
it
then
for
the
first
time
raised
the
issue
of
equal
protection
of
laws
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
federal
constitution.
this
--
mr.
john
w.
trimble
i
believe
it
was
on
an
appeal,
a
direct
appeal
but
for
the
first
time
raised
a
federal
issue
at
which
time
the
attorney
general
did
contact
me
and
suggested
at
which
i
was
doing
at
the
time,
that
i
enter
a
motion
to
dismiss
for
failure
to
raised
any
federal
issue,
any
constitutional
issue
up
to
that
point
since
there
was
no
dissent
and
the
appellate
division
there
was
no
grounds
for
an
appeal
to
new
jersey
supreme
court.
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
when
faced
with
this
problem
simply
stated
as
it's
outlined
on
page
9
of
the
appendix,
this
court
may
not
need
--
this
court
may
but
need
not
accept
the
constitutional
question
not
raise
below.
as
this
constitutional
contention
is
one
of
the
great
concern
to
many
municipalities
and
nonprofit
foreign
corporations
the
public
interest
in
this
question
demands
that
it
would
be
decided.
so
they
recognized
it,
it
had
not
been
raised
but
they
accepted
it
to
put
this
question
to
rest
under
the
state
statute.
mr.
john
w.
trimble
oh,
i
argue
of
course
that
they
waived
the
rule
to
hear
the
case.
mr.
john
w.
trimble
right.
mr.
john
w.
trimble
they
have
decided
that
the
--
the
cons
--
the
statute
is
constitutional
under
the
constitutional
tagged
first
raised
there.
of
course,
it
is
my
understanding
that
this
court
demands
that
when
a
constitutional
issue
is
to
be
raised
it
would
be
raised
at
the
lowest
level
and
not
be
raised
as
an
afterthought
and
perhaps
the
last
court
in
the
state.
and
as
set
forth
in
the
appendix
the
question
was
never
raised,
it
was
just
the
statutory
construction
whether
that
they
were
organized
and
came
under
that
exemption.
and
of
course,
the
argument
they
lost
all
those
arguments
through
the
state
courts.
mr.
john
w.
trimble
suppose
the
law
required
it,
it
could
not
be
raised
below?
mr.
john
w.
trimble
well,
your
honor,
i
can't
foresee
of
any
type
of
a
rule
that
said
you
could
not
raised
a
constitutional
issue
at
a
trial
level.
mr.
john
w.
trimble
the
state
supreme
court
did
accept
the
case
and
acknowledge
it
and
perhaps
it
was
not
raised
but
we
want
to
let
hear
this
case
anyhow.
so
it
could
be
argued
either
way,
well,
if
it
wasn't
raised
but
we're
going
to
hear
it
anyhow
or
although
it
wasn't
raised
we'll
allow
you
to
raised
it
in
this
court
and
i
think
and
all
fairness
that
they
did
listen
to
the
constitution
arguing
at
the
highest
court
in
new
jersey,
i
think
there
is
any
--
mr.
john
w.
trimble
they
decided
that
as
one
of
the
points
raised
and
upheld
the
--
mr.
john
w.
trimble
that's
true,
your
honor.
mr.
john
w.
trimble
well,
i
think
the
latter
part
of
your
statement
is
correct
that
this
court
has
held
it
that
way
that
and
--
mr.
john
w.
trimble
now
the
–
as
we
stated
the
channel
12
is
now
exempt
from
this
time
on
from
68
on
we're
only
arguing
about
back
taxes.
now
the
--
of
course
the
borough
of
glassboro
now
finds
itself
in
a
position
where
it
is
arguing
for
this
back
taxes
that
they're
local
citizens
have
paid,
and
which
they
won't
--
apparently
won't,
will
not
be
able
to
retrieve
if
now
this
court
were
to
decide
that
this
statute
that
was
effective
up
to
1968
is
in
fact
unconstitutional.
now
this
court
has
upheld
in
cases
where
there
are
a
foreign
corporation
need
not
be
given
equal
treatment
with
domestic
corporations.
the
thrust
of
the,
of
our
glassboro's
argument
in
this
matter
is
that
these
cases
deal
with
profit
corporations
that
are
involved
in
an
interstate
commerce.
and
the
reasoning
behind
this
that
they
--
we
should
not
discriminate
against
foreign
corporations.
because
at
the
federal
level
we
look
at
the
nation
as
a
whole
and
we
don't
divide
it
into
boundary
lines,
and
there
shouldn't
be
adverse
discrimination
between
these
corporations,
however,
in
this
situation
i
think
the
focus
is
directive
wrong.
here,
the
state
of
new
jersey
is
giving
a
gift.
we're
allowing
a
complete
exemption
from
any
taxes
and
it
appears
to
me
that
the
state
of
new
jersey
should
be
able
to
decide
who
they're
going
to
give
this
gift
to.
this
people
pay
no
taxes
whatsoever
or
they're
demanding
that
they
pay
no
taxes
whatsoever.
they
don't
want
to
pay
for
any
local
municipal
services
at
all.
they
want
to
be
completely
free
from
all
taxes
and
new
jersey
says
that
we'll
grant
these
exemptions
if
you
follow
some
simple
procedures.
number
one,
that
you
will
be
nonprofit,
they
are.
number
two,
of
course
that
you
own
property,
which
they
do.
and
number
three,
that
you'd
be
organized
to
incorporate
on
the
state
of
new
jersey.
now
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
--
mr.
john
w.
trimble
your
honor,
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
handled
that
problem
briefly
and
i
do
not
say
that
the
statements
they
made
is
the
end
of
the
reasons
that
might
be
put
forth
on
why
you
should
be
incorporated
in
new
jersey
to
--
mr.
john
w.
trimble
for
instance
and
of
course
this
is
all
we're
trying
to
fathom
what
the
legislature
had
in
mind
some
25
years
ago
when
they
enacted
this
situation.
this
corporation
derives
all
of
its
assets
from
contributions
of
the
public.
many
of
which
are
in
new
jersey
and
of
course,
the
federal
government
and
different
foundations
donate
money
to
provide
the
facilities
that
they
give.
i
could
foresee
the
situation
where
whyy
would
become
insolvent
for
one
reason
or
another.
the
new
jersey
may
have
an
interest
on,
what
happened
to
the
donations
of
the
people
in
new
jersey?
they
may
have
a
jurisdictional
problem
since
it's
a
foreign
corporation,
the
new
jersey
people
have
donated
money
to
the
facilities
involved
here.
whereas
if
they
were
incorporated
in
new
jersey
our
chancery
court
would
take
jurisdiction
of
an
insolvent
corporation
and
there
is
procedure
set
forth
on
listing
assets,
etcetera
on
what
happens
to
this
money
and
where
it
is
to
be
distributed
the
new
jersey
--
mr.
john
w.
trimble
we
asked
them
to
incorporate,
if
they
had
incorporated
and
follow
the
law
for
some
reason
on
benounce
to
me
a
very
simple
procedure.
number
one,
the
borough
of
glassboro
wouldn't
have
them
on
their
books,
we
wouldn't
be
faced
with
this
problem,
i
wouldn't
be
here
today
arguing
for
these
back
taxes.
we
have
been
put
in
a
position
where
we're
in
a
bind
we're
defending
a
new
jersey
statute
for
our
back
taxes
and
they
have
amended
it
on
us
so,
which
is
fine
but
of
course,
the
local
citizens
have
had
to
payout
their
own
pocket
these
back
taxes.
and
we're
in
dilemma
here
and
i'm
only
trying
to
pick
reasons
out
in
thin
air
and
to
be
quite
frank
with
you,
it
is
difficult
and
i
think
the
court
--
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
have
a
little
bit
of
trouble.
when
they
mentioned
the
point
about
perhaps
the
local
assessor
should
not
be
burdened
with
the
problem
of
trying
to
figure
out
what
a
foreign
jurisdiction
considers
as
nonprofit.
of
course,
it's
not
applicable
on
this
case
because
we
agreed
there
is
no
question
that
channel
12
whyy
is
nonprofit.
i
feel
this
is
a
suggestion
put
forth
by
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
and
it
is
not
the
end
reasoning
of
the
new
jersey
legislature.
the
--
mr.
john
w.
trimble
i
feel
in
the
surface
of
it,
it
appears
that
it
does
discriminate
against
a
foreign
corporation
as
compared
to
a
local
corporation
basically
on
the
balance
that
--on
the
grounds
that
they
did
not
incorporate
in
the
state
of
new
jersey.
mr.
john
w.
trimble
i
haven't
raised
that
point
and
i
think
they
are,
i
don't
think
there
is
any
question
that
the
–
if
you're
alluding
to
the
problem
of
whether
corporations
are
allowed
to
raise
the
equal
protection
clause
as
not
being
a
person.
i
didn't
think
of,
that
was
a
much
moment
to
raise
that
point
although
it
has
been
raised
in
many,
many
times
before
i
--
it
appears
that
it
doesn't
carryout
much
weight
in
this
court.
and
so
i
didn't
raise
the
point
that
they're
not
a
person
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
john
w.
trimble
it's
a
repeal
effective
january
1,
1968
of
the
new
jersey
decision
in
this
matter.
mr.
john
w.
trimble
well,
the
language
of
it
as
its
set
forth
that
it's
clearly
aimed,
of
course,
the
information
i
have
and
the
knowledge
i
have
of
this
matter
is
without
the
record,
and
that
it
wouldn't
be
fair
to
bring
out
why
i
feel
that
this
is
clearly
meant
to
repeal
it.
i
mean
the
fact
that
the
senator
that
sponsored
the
bill
was
the
law
firm
that
was
arguing
these
matters
to
the
state
court
may
have
be
of
no
moment
but
i
think
it
might
be
significant.
the
fact
that
this
litigation
has
been
going
on
to
this
time
and
soon
after
the
one
of
the
decisions
was
handled
down,
this
thing
was
put
to
the
legislation
i
think
in
about
6
or
7
weeks
which
is
unusual.
and
it
was
made
effective
six
months
afterwards,
which
was
the
1st
of
the
january
1968
and
as
an
aid
it's
educational.
mr.
john
w.
trimble
yes.
mr.
john
w.
trimble
he
did
but
i
think
the
chief
justice's
question
was
“what
was
the
background
of
this,
whether
it
was
a
clarification
or
repeal?”
and
i
think
mr.
marsh
said
that
he'd
like
to
think
of
it
as
a
clarification
rather
than
an
appeal
of
it.
and
i,
it's
my
position
of
course,
that
it
was
an
appeal
of
it
specifically
for
the
act
is
for
educational
corporations
either
domestic
or
foreign.
the
rule
--
the
main
case
that's
faced,
that
i'm
faced
with
of
course
is
the
case
in
the
glander
case,
which
this
court
has
ruled
on
and
has
upheld
in
previous
cases
on
discrimination
against
foreign
corporations
as
concerned
with
domestic
corporations.
the
glander
case
of
course,
as
i
said
before,
the
focus
is
on
profit
corporations
that
are
in
the
business
for
profit
that
the
firm
in
the
ohio
corporation
there
was
not
ohio
--
a
foreign
corporation
in
ohio.
of
course,
it
was
paying
all
its
property
taxes.
all
its
personal
property
taxes,
its
franchise
taxes
then
they
were
attempting
to
tax
the
accounts
receivable
in
that
matter
to
the
discrimination
of
the
foreign
corporation
as
compared
to
the,
to
the
domestic
corporation.
the
problem
we're
faced
with
here
is
an
outward
grant
by
the
state
of
new
jersey,
a
gift
and
the
point
is
that
they
should
be
allowed
to
decide
who
gets
the
scheme.
mr.
john
w.
trimble
exemptions
for
nonprofit
corporations,
i
think
that
they
should
be
--
mr.
john
w.
trimble
i
think
they
should
be
--
mr.
john
w.
trimble
well,
i
think
that
it
should
be
reviewable
but
i
don't
think
in
the
same
light
your
honor,
as
a
profit
corporation
new
jersey
could
very
well
become
the
maker
of
nonprofit
corporations
without
the
state
putting
any
type
of
guidelines
on
what
they
have
to
do
to
get
in
here.
all
that
they
do
when
they
said
they've
been
domesticated
is,
they
simply
file
a
--
an
application
as
to
a
registered
agent.
what
is
set
forth
in
the
appendix
here
concerning
application
to
become
a
--
to
register
in
the
state
of
new
jersey
deals
mainly
with
profit
corporations.
it's
even
under
title
14
which
is
our
profit
corporations,
nonprofit
is
at
title
15.
it
is
for
such
things
as
stockholders.
these
people
don't
have
any
stockholders.
the
amount
of
outstanding
stocks
and
assets
like
that,
it's
just,
it's
not
applicable
to
these
people.
they
just
have
a
registered
agent
on
the
--
so
that
state
in
new
jersey
knows
who
they
can
contact
in
the
event
of
a
lawsuit
or
any
other
type
of
service.
mr.
john
w.
trimble
well,
i'm
sure
that
the
attorney
general's
office
has
some
type
of
control
but
for
taxing
purposes
--
mr.
john
w.
trimble
tax?
oh!
for
other
purposes?
mr.
john
w.
trimble
i
don't
know
whether
i
could
give
a
direct
answer
to
that.
mr.
john
w.
trimble
i
don't
think
unless
there
was
a
complaint
lies
against
someone
that
was
circumventing
the
nonprofit
status.
new
jersey
wouldn't
be
concerned
because
the
taxing
problem
is
a
local
one.
so
the
local
tax
assessor
must
review
the
situation
to
make
sure
that
they
are
fulfilling
this
status
and
there
is
a
provision
wherever
here.
they're
supposed
to
re-file
to
show
that
their
activities
do
continue
to
be
nonprofit,
so
they
are
entitled
to
the
exemptions
as
set
forth
in
the
statute.
i
would
like
to
reserve
anytime
remaining
to
any
rebuttal
for
mr.
marsh.
mr.
john
w.
trimble
thank
you.
a
case
was
alluded
to
in
the
appellant's
brief
the
board
of
education
of
kentucky
versus
illinois
case
which
was,
is
the
only
case
involved
in
the
appellant's
brief
with
nonprofit
corporations
as
of
situation
where
a
state
did
discriminate
on
it's
taxing,
on
a
taxing
basis
for
a
nonprofit
corporation.
and
it
was
upheld
and
that
the
basis
being
that
this
money
was
going
to
be
used
--
have
to
be
used
exclusively
in
the
state
of
kentucky
therefore
illinois
would
not
receive
any
benefits
from
it
and
therefore
could
tax
it
on
it,
it
was
an
inheritance
tax,
i
believe
in
that
matter.
now
it
can
be
differentiated
in
the
fact
that
the
whyy
is
claiming
that
they
do
some
benefits
for
the
state
of
new
jersey
in
southern
new
jersey
with
their
transmitter.
the
problem
of
rebutting
the
voluminous
information
that
was
supplied
was
that
this
information
was
supplied
just
prior
to
argument
before
the
new
jersey
supreme
court.
this
question
apparently
came
up
in
their
mind
“what
benefits
does
new
jersey
receive
from
your
channel
12?”
and
this
was
supplied
as
an
outline
in
their
appendix.
however,
i
don't
think
it
would
be
outlined
at
an
extension
of
that
rule
of
the
illinois
case
could
be
applicable
here.
and
that
the
discrimination
that
new
jersey
is
attempting
or
this
alleged
discrimination
is
not
that
far
and
unfair
to
the
local
residence
of
glassboro
that
that
rule
could
be
extended
to
this
situation.
that
they
should
incorporate
in
the
state
of
new
jersey
so
that
the
glassboro
wouldn't
have
taxed
them
and
then
be
bound
in
the
situation
they
find
themselves
today.
and
the
case
cited
that
railway
express
agency
versus
virginia
were
justice
holmes
wrote
the
opinion
in
that
where
they
forced
a
foreign
corporation
to
incorporate
to
do
any
business
in
the
state.
and
this
was
held
not
to
be
unreasonable
and
if
they
want
to
do
business
in
the
state
they
should
incorporate
and
this
was
upheld.
thank
you
mr.
john
w.
trimble
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
john
w.
trimble
the
attorney
general,
your
honor
was
never
in
this
matter.
he
let
me
carry
the
ball
through
all
the
courts
and
filed
a
statement
that
in
lieu
of
a
brief
that
he
felt
that
the
situation
was
being
adequately
argued
by
the
borough
of
glassboro
and
therefore
he
would
not
participate.
the
situation
is
that
the
state
of
new
jersey
--
mr.
john
w.
trimble
well,
they
have
entered
their
appearance
for
the
state
of
new
jersey
but
they've
only
entered
a
statement
in
lieu
of
a
brief.
and
appeared
that
none
of
hearings
to
argue
is
a
matter
and
throughout
all
the
record
you'll
see
that
the
deputy
attorney
general's
name
is
listed
there
but
never
appeared.
this
is
one
of
the
problems
faced
in
this
matters
that
the
state
of
new
jersey
of
course
receives
and
none
of
this
taxes.
this
is
a
law
of
course
passed
by
the
new
jersey
legislature.
where
the
tax
situation
as
i'm
sure
you're
aware
of
in
new
jersey
it's
for
the
local,
a
local
purpose
for
the
fire
protection
and
police
protection
for
the
local
municipalities.
none
of
this
money
ever
inures
to
the
state
of
new
jersey
and
since
the
borough
of
glassboro
the
one
interested
in
this
matter.
we
of
course
carried
the
ball
through
the
fight
and
the
upholding
the
state
statute
on
this
matter.
now
the
--
in
addition
to
the
facts
that
were
set
forth
by
the
appellant
i'd
like
to
add
that
the
channel
12,
whyy
never
applied
for
an
exemption
under
the
statute
54:4-4.4.
this
was
not
handled
in
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
because
they
felt
they
didn't
have
to
handle
that
they've
upheld
the
statute
so
therefore
they
did
not
consider
this
point.
the
reason
this
may
be
very
important
is
that
the
procedure
is
set
forth
where
a
form
is
filled
out
for
the
tax
assessor
to
review
the
statements
by
someone
claiming
the
exemption
and
why
they
should
be
exempt.
the
record
is
clear
that
the
borough
was
put
on
noticed,
a
letter
was
sent
by
this
attorney
for
the
television
station
asking
for
an
exemption,
which
was
referred
to
the
local
solicitor
who
then
referred
to
the
states
statute
and
says,
you're
not
exempt
because
under
the
new
jersey
statute
which
is
set
forth
in
the
appendix
on
page
17
the
section
which
excluded
them
of
course
and
which
was
the
argument
i
might
say
all
through
the
new
jersey
courts
up
into
the
supreme
court
that
the
foregoing
exemptions
shall
apply
only
when
the
association,
corporation
or
institution
claiming
the
exemption
owns
the
property
in
question
that
is
incorporated,
were
organized
under
the
laws
of
this
state,
and
authorized
to
carry
out
the
purposes
on
account
of
which
the
exemption
is
claimed.
we
agree
that
this
channel
12
is
a
nonprofit
corporation.
there's
no
question
that
they
comply
in
every
way
with
what
new
jersey
would
consider
a
nonprofit
corporation
that
is
not
our
argument
today.
the
situation
is
that
the
borough
of
glassboro
has
filed
the
law
in
new
jersey
by
denying
this
exemption.
we
had
to
list
this
over
a
hundred
thousand
dollars
of
ratables
both
real
and
personal
on
our
books.
the
local
citizens
had
to
pay
these
taxes
because
we
have
the
county
government
that
relies
on
what
you
access
on
your
local
municipalities
to
run
the
county
government
in
gloucester
county
which
glassboro
situate.
now
they
have
been
paying
these
taxes
and
they
have
to
make
up
this
deficit
every
year,
which
now
amounts
to
a
sum
of
$60,000.00.
it
is
true
we
are
only
arguing
back
taxes
now.
the
new
act
that
became
effective
january
1,
1968
and
i
might
say
the
same
question
was
raised
by
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
whether
this
was
a
--
an
act
to
clarify
the
existing
law
or
was
it
a
modification
to
carry
on
after
january
1st.
and
i
might
only
add
that
the
law
firm
that
was
handling
the
matter
in
the
state
level
was
from
a
law
firm
where
the
senators
sponsored
the
bill.
so
i
think
it's
safe
to
say
that
it
was
not
a
declaratory
act
but
it
was
an
act
to
amend
54:4-3.6
and
to
carry
on
after
1st
of
january.
mr.
john
w.
trimble
the
new
act
simply
says
that
nonprofit
corporations
whether
they
be
domestic
or
foreign
or
exempt
under
i
think
the
new
citation
is
3.6
(a)
or
something.
it
just
includes
them
in
there
domestic
or
foreign
corporations
are
included
in
the
exemption
of
the
section.
down
at
it's
--
the
taxes
as
i
said
amount
to
approximately
$60,000.00.
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to
the
procedural
point
here
that
the
fact
that
the
federal
issue
was
never
raised
in
this
matter
to
all
the
supreme
court
in
new
jersey.
and
it
might
not
have
been
raised
then,
had
it
not
been
for
the
fact
that
the
appellate
division
of
the
superior
court
was
unanimous
in
upholding
the
statute
as
it
was
argued.
because
it
was
argued
that
by
channel
12
that
they
are
organized
under
the
laws
of
new
jersey
because
they
qualified
--
because
they
had
a
registered
agent
in
the
state
that
could
be
served,
service
of
process.
so
therefore,
they
were
“organized”.
of
course,
the
word
“organized”
as
shown
in
the
opinions
of
the
superior
court
appellate
division
and
the
state
supreme
court,
new
jersey
state
supreme
court
meant
that
it
dealt
with
organizations
such
as
religious
organizations
that
are
not
incorporated
but
nevertheless
are
organized
in
new
jersey
and
are
available
for
the
exemption.
this
is
the
argument
that
prevailed
to
the
supreme
court
then
the
appellant
in
this
matter
was
faced
with
a
problem
on
how
to
get
into
the
supreme
court.
because
there
was
no
dissent
in
the
appellate
division
and
no
constitutional
issue
raised.
it
then
for
the
first
time
raised
the
issue
of
equal
protection
of
laws
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
federal
constitution.
this
--
mr.
john
w.
trimble
i
believe
it
was
on
an
appeal,
a
direct
appeal
but
for
the
first
time
raised
a
federal
issue
at
which
time
the
attorney
general
did
contact
me
and
suggested
at
which
i
was
doing
at
the
time,
that
i
enter
a
motion
to
dismiss
for
failure
to
raised
any
federal
issue,
any
constitutional
issue
up
to
that
point
since
there
was
no
dissent
and
the
appellate
division
there
was
no
grounds
for
an
appeal
to
new
jersey
supreme
court.
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
when
faced
with
this
problem
simply
stated
as
it's
outlined
on
page
9
of
the
appendix,
this
court
may
not
need
--
this
court
may
but
need
not
accept
the
constitutional
question
not
raise
below.
as
this
constitutional
contention
is
one
of
the
great
concern
to
many
municipalities
and
nonprofit
foreign
corporations
the
public
interest
in
this
question
demands
that
it
would
be
decided.
so
they
recognized
it,
it
had
not
been
raised
but
they
accepted
it
to
put
this
question
to
rest
under
the
state
statute.
mr.
john
w.
trimble
oh,
i
argue
of
course
that
they
waived
the
rule
to
hear
the
case.
mr.
john
w.
trimble
right.
mr.
john
w.
trimble
they
have
decided
that
the
--
the
cons
--
the
statute
is
constitutional
under
the
constitutional
tagged
first
raised
there.
of
course,
it
is
my
understanding
that
this
court
demands
that
when
a
constitutional
issue
is
to
be
raised
it
would
be
raised
at
the
lowest
level
and
not
be
raised
as
an
afterthought
and
perhaps
the
last
court
in
the
state.
and
as
set
forth
in
the
appendix
the
question
was
never
raised,
it
was
just
the
statutory
construction
whether
that
they
were
organized
and
came
under
that
exemption.
and
of
course,
the
argument
they
lost
all
those
arguments
through
the
state
courts.
mr.
john
w.
trimble
suppose
the
law
required
it,
it
could
not
be
raised
below?
mr.
john
w.
trimble
well,
your
honor,
i
can't
foresee
of
any
type
of
a
rule
that
said
you
could
not
raised
a
constitutional
issue
at
a
trial
level.
mr.
john
w.
trimble
the
state
supreme
court
did
accept
the
case
and
acknowledge
it
and
perhaps
it
was
not
raised
but
we
want
to
let
hear
this
case
anyhow.
so
it
could
be
argued
either
way,
well,
if
it
wasn't
raised
but
we're
going
to
hear
it
anyhow
or
although
it
wasn't
raised
we'll
allow
you
to
raised
it
in
this
court
and
i
think
and
all
fairness
that
they
did
listen
to
the
constitution
arguing
at
the
highest
court
in
new
jersey,
i
think
there
is
any
--
mr.
john
w.
trimble
they
decided
that
as
one
of
the
points
raised
and
upheld
the
--
mr.
john
w.
trimble
that's
true,
your
honor.
mr.
john
w.
trimble
well,
i
think
the
latter
part
of
your
statement
is
correct
that
this
court
has
held
it
that
way
that
and
--
mr.
john
w.
trimble
now
the
–
as
we
stated
the
channel
12
is
now
exempt
from
this
time
on
from
68
on
we're
only
arguing
about
back
taxes.
now
the
--
of
course
the
borough
of
glassboro
now
finds
itself
in
a
position
where
it
is
arguing
for
this
back
taxes
that
they're
local
citizens
have
paid,
and
which
they
won't
--
apparently
won't,
will
not
be
able
to
retrieve
if
now
this
court
were
to
decide
that
this
statute
that
was
effective
up
to
1968
is
in
fact
unconstitutional.
now
this
court
has
upheld
in
cases
where
there
are
a
foreign
corporation
need
not
be
given
equal
treatment
with
domestic
corporations.
the
thrust
of
the,
of
our
glassboro's
argument
in
this
matter
is
that
these
cases
deal
with
profit
corporations
that
are
involved
in
an
interstate
commerce.
and
the
reasoning
behind
this
that
they
--
we
should
not
discriminate
against
foreign
corporations.
because
at
the
federal
level
we
look
at
the
nation
as
a
whole
and
we
don't
divide
it
into
boundary
lines,
and
there
shouldn't
be
adverse
discrimination
between
these
corporations,
however,
in
this
situation
i
think
the
focus
is
directive
wrong.
here,
the
state
of
new
jersey
is
giving
a
gift.
we're
allowing
a
complete
exemption
from
any
taxes
and
it
appears
to
me
that
the
state
of
new
jersey
should
be
able
to
decide
who
they're
going
to
give
this
gift
to.
this
people
pay
no
taxes
whatsoever
or
they're
demanding
that
they
pay
no
taxes
whatsoever.
they
don't
want
to
pay
for
any
local
municipal
services
at
all.
they
want
to
be
completely
free
from
all
taxes
and
new
jersey
says
that
we'll
grant
these
exemptions
if
you
follow
some
simple
procedures.
number
one,
that
you
will
be
nonprofit,
they
are.
number
two,
of
course
that
you
own
property,
which
they
do.
and
number
three,
that
you'd
be
organized
to
incorporate
on
the
state
of
new
jersey.
now
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
--
mr.
john
w.
trimble
your
honor,
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
handled
that
problem
briefly
and
i
do
not
say
that
the
statements
they
made
is
the
end
of
the
reasons
that
might
be
put
forth
on
why
you
should
be
incorporated
in
new
jersey
to
--
mr.
john
w.
trimble
for
instance
and
of
course
this
is
all
we're
trying
to
fathom
what
the
legislature
had
in
mind
some
25
years
ago
when
they
enacted
this
situation.
this
corporation
derives
all
of
its
assets
from
contributions
of
the
public.
many
of
which
are
in
new
jersey
and
of
course,
the
federal
government
and
different
foundations
donate
money
to
provide
the
facilities
that
they
give.
i
could
foresee
the
situation
where
whyy
would
become
insolvent
for
one
reason
or
another.
the
new
jersey
may
have
an
interest
on,
what
happened
to
the
donations
of
the
people
in
new
jersey?
they
may
have
a
jurisdictional
problem
since
it's
a
foreign
corporation,
the
new
jersey
people
have
donated
money
to
the
facilities
involved
here.
whereas
if
they
were
incorporated
in
new
jersey
our
chancery
court
would
take
jurisdiction
of
an
insolvent
corporation
and
there
is
procedure
set
forth
on
listing
assets,
etcetera
on
what
happens
to
this
money
and
where
it
is
to
be
distributed
the
new
jersey
--
mr.
john
w.
trimble
we
asked
them
to
incorporate,
if
they
had
incorporated
and
follow
the
law
for
some
reason
on
benounce
to
me
a
very
simple
procedure.
number
one,
the
borough
of
glassboro
wouldn't
have
them
on
their
books,
we
wouldn't
be
faced
with
this
problem,
i
wouldn't
be
here
today
arguing
for
these
back
taxes.
we
have
been
put
in
a
position
where
we're
in
a
bind
we're
defending
a
new
jersey
statute
for
our
back
taxes
and
they
have
amended
it
on
us
so,
which
is
fine
but
of
course,
the
local
citizens
have
had
to
payout
their
own
pocket
these
back
taxes.
and
we're
in
dilemma
here
and
i'm
only
trying
to
pick
reasons
out
in
thin
air
and
to
be
quite
frank
with
you,
it
is
difficult
and
i
think
the
court
--
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
have
a
little
bit
of
trouble.
when
they
mentioned
the
point
about
perhaps
the
local
assessor
should
not
be
burdened
with
the
problem
of
trying
to
figure
out
what
a
foreign
jurisdiction
considers
as
nonprofit.
of
course,
it's
not
applicable
on
this
case
because
we
agreed
there
is
no
question
that
channel
12
whyy
is
nonprofit.
i
feel
this
is
a
suggestion
put
forth
by
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
and
it
is
not
the
end
reasoning
of
the
new
jersey
legislature.
the
--
mr.
john
w.
trimble
i
feel
in
the
surface
of
it,
it
appears
that
it
does
discriminate
against
a
foreign
corporation
as
compared
to
a
local
corporation
basically
on
the
balance
that
--on
the
grounds
that
they
did
not
incorporate
in
the
state
of
new
jersey.
mr.
john
w.
trimble
i
haven't
raised
that
point
and
i
think
they
are,
i
don't
think
there
is
any
question
that
the
–
if
you're
alluding
to
the
problem
of
whether
corporations
are
allowed
to
raise
the
equal
protection
clause
as
not
being
a
person.
i
didn't
think
of,
that
was
a
much
moment
to
raise
that
point
although
it
has
been
raised
in
many,
many
times
before
i
--
it
appears
that
it
doesn't
carryout
much
weight
in
this
court.
and
so
i
didn't
raise
the
point
that
they're
not
a
person
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
john
w.
trimble
it's
a
repeal
effective
january
1,
1968
of
the
new
jersey
decision
in
this
matter.
mr.
john
w.
trimble
well,
the
language
of
it
as
its
set
forth
that
it's
clearly
aimed,
of
course,
the
information
i
have
and
the
knowledge
i
have
of
this
matter
is
without
the
record,
and
that
it
wouldn't
be
fair
to
bring
out
why
i
feel
that
this
is
clearly
meant
to
repeal
it.
i
mean
the
fact
that
the
senator
that
sponsored
the
bill
was
the
law
firm
that
was
arguing
these
matters
to
the
state
court
may
have
be
of
no
moment
but
i
think
it
might
be
significant.
the
fact
that
this
litigation
has
been
going
on
to
this
time
and
soon
after
the
one
of
the
decisions
was
handled
down,
this
thing
was
put
to
the
legislation
i
think
in
about
6
or
7
weeks
which
is
unusual.
and
it
was
made
effective
six
months
afterwards,
which
was
the
1st
of
the
january
1968
and
as
an
aid
it's
educational.
mr.
john
w.
trimble
yes.
mr.
john
w.
trimble
he
did
but
i
think
the
chief
justice's
question
was
“what
was
the
background
of
this,
whether
it
was
a
clarification
or
repeal?”
and
i
think
mr.
marsh
said
that
he'd
like
to
think
of
it
as
a
clarification
rather
than
an
appeal
of
it.
and
i,
it's
my
position
of
course,
that
it
was
an
appeal
of
it
specifically
for
the
act
is
for
educational
corporations
either
domestic
or
foreign.
the
rule
--
the
main
case
that's
faced,
that
i'm
faced
with
of
course
is
the
case
in
the
glander
case,
which
this
court
has
ruled
on
and
has
upheld
in
previous
cases
on
discrimination
against
foreign
corporations
as
concerned
with
domestic
corporations.
the
glander
case
of
course,
as
i
said
before,
the
focus
is
on
profit
corporations
that
are
in
the
business
for
profit
that
the
firm
in
the
ohio
corporation
there
was
not
ohio
--
a
foreign
corporation
in
ohio.
of
course,
it
was
paying
all
its
property
taxes.
all
its
personal
property
taxes,
its
franchise
taxes
then
they
were
attempting
to
tax
the
accounts
receivable
in
that
matter
to
the
discrimination
of
the
foreign
corporation
as
compared
to
the,
to
the
domestic
corporation.
the
problem
we're
faced
with
here
is
an
outward
grant
by
the
state
of
new
jersey,
a
gift
and
the
point
is
that
they
should
be
allowed
to
decide
who
gets
the
scheme.
mr.
john
w.
trimble
exemptions
for
nonprofit
corporations,
i
think
that
they
should
be
--
mr.
john
w.
trimble
i
think
they
should
be
--
mr.
john
w.
trimble
well,
i
think
that
it
should
be
reviewable
but
i
don't
think
in
the
same
light
your
honor,
as
a
profit
corporation
new
jersey
could
very
well
become
the
maker
of
nonprofit
corporations
without
the
state
putting
any
type
of
guidelines
on
what
they
have
to
do
to
get
in
here.
all
that
they
do
when
they
said
they've
been
domesticated
is,
they
simply
file
a
--
an
application
as
to
a
registered
agent.
what
is
set
forth
in
the
appendix
here
concerning
application
to
become
a
--
to
register
in
the
state
of
new
jersey
deals
mainly
with
profit
corporations.
it's
even
under
title
14
which
is
our
profit
corporations,
nonprofit
is
at
title
15.
it
is
for
such
things
as
stockholders.
these
people
don't
have
any
stockholders.
the
amount
of
outstanding
stocks
and
assets
like
that,
it's
just,
it's
not
applicable
to
these
people.
they
just
have
a
registered
agent
on
the
--
so
that
state
in
new
jersey
knows
who
they
can
contact
in
the
event
of
a
lawsuit
or
any
other
type
of
service.
mr.
john
w.
trimble
well,
i'm
sure
that
the
attorney
general's
office
has
some
type
of
control
but
for
taxing
purposes
--
mr.
john
w.
trimble
tax?
oh!
for
other
purposes?
mr.
john
w.
trimble
i
don't
know
whether
i
could
give
a
direct
answer
to
that.
mr.
john
w.
trimble
i
don't
think
unless
there
was
a
complaint
lies
against
someone
that
was
circumventing
the
nonprofit
status.
new
jersey
wouldn't
be
concerned
because
the
taxing
problem
is
a
local
one.
so
the
local
tax
assessor
must
review
the
situation
to
make
sure
that
they
are
fulfilling
this
status
and
there
is
a
provision
wherever
here.
they're
supposed
to
re-file
to
show
that
their
activities
do
continue
to
be
nonprofit,
so
they
are
entitled
to
the
exemptions
as
set
forth
in
the
statute.
i
would
like
to
reserve
anytime
remaining
to
any
rebuttal
for
mr.
marsh.
mr.
john
w.
trimble
thank
you.
a
case
was
alluded
to
in
the
appellant's
brief
the
board
of
education
of
kentucky
versus
illinois
case
which
was,
is
the
only
case
involved
in
the
appellant's
brief
with
nonprofit
corporations
as
of
situation
where
a
state
did
discriminate
on
it's
taxing,
on
a
taxing
basis
for
a
nonprofit
corporation.
and
it
was
upheld
and
that
the
basis
being
that
this
money
was
going
to
be
used
--
have
to
be
used
exclusively
in
the
state
of
kentucky
therefore
illinois
would
not
receive
any
benefits
from
it
and
therefore
could
tax
it
on
it,
it
was
an
inheritance
tax,
i
believe
in
that
matter.
now
it
can
be
differentiated
in
the
fact
that
the
whyy
is
claiming
that
they
do
some
benefits
for
the
state
of
new
jersey
in
southern
new
jersey
with
their
transmitter.
the
problem
of
rebutting
the
voluminous
information
that
was
supplied
was
that
this
information
was
supplied
just
prior
to
argument
before
the
new
jersey
supreme
court.
this
question
apparently
came
up
in
their
mind
“what
benefits
does
new
jersey
receive
from
your
channel
12?”
and
this
was
supplied
as
an
outline
in
their
appendix.
however,
i
don't
think
it
would
be
outlined
at
an
extension
of
that
rule
of
the
illinois
case
could
be
applicable
here.
and
that
the
discrimination
that
new
jersey
is
attempting
or
this
alleged
discrimination
is
not
that
far
and
unfair
to
the
local
residence
of
glassboro
that
that
rule
could
be
extended
to
this
situation.
that
they
should
incorporate
in
the
state
of
new
jersey
so
that
the
glassboro
wouldn't
have
taxed
them
and
then
be
bound
in
the
situation
they
find
themselves
today.
and
the
case
cited
that
railway
express
agency
versus
virginia
were
justice
holmes
wrote
the
opinion
in
that
where
they
forced
a
foreign
corporation
to
incorporate
to
do
any
business
in
the
state.
and
this
was
held
not
to
be
unreasonable
and
if
they
want
to
do
business
in
the
state
they
should
incorporate
and
this
was
upheld.
thank
you
