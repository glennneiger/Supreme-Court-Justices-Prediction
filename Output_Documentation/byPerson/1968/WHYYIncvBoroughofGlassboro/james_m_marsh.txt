mr.
james
m.
marsh
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
from
the
supreme
court
of
new
jersey.
it
presents
a
single
clear
issue
of
constitutional
law,
which
is
whether
or
not
a
state
can
permit
its
municipalities
to
tax
certain
property
used
within
new
jersey
by
a
foreign,
nonprofit
corporation
which
has
qualified
and
based
in
new
jersey,
and
at
the
same
time,
permit
them
to
exempt
from
taxation
same
type
of
property
when
used
by
a
new
jersey
nonprofit
corporation.
we
believe
of
course
that
is
denial
of
equal
protection
as
that
term
is
now
applied
by
this
court
over
the
years.
now
the
appellant
here
whyy
was
one
brought
under
pennsylvania
law
in
1952.
it's
also
license
by
the
federal
communications
commission
for
the
transmission
of
noncommercial
radio
and
tv
programs.
it
is
subject
to
great
many
restrictions
by
both
the
state
and
the
fcc.
it
is
not
permitted
to
sell
time,
it
is
not
permitted
to
accept
advertising,
it
cannot
engage
in
any
activity
which
inures
profit
to
any
corporation
or
person,
it's
not
permitted
to
pay
dividends.
the
property
involved
in
this
case
is
the
only
property
which,
whyy
has
in
new
jersey.
as
a
site
where
there
is
a
tower
for
transmission
of
television
programs
on
the
channel
12,
the
site
must
be
personally
involved
is
what
lead
to
this
case.
all
the
programs
in
whyy
from
channel
12
are
educational,
cultural
or
recreational.
they
broadcast
daily
for
the
benefit
of
schools
in
a
number
of
school
district
in
the
three
or
four
states
involved
including
a
number
in
new
jersey.
they
have
other
programs
in
evenings
and
on
saturdays.
the
population
of
the
area
reached
by
channel
12
was
about
8
million
people
and
the
record
shows
that
about
29.5%
are
located
in
new
jersey.
now
at
pages
47
to
67
there
is
a
detailed
statement
as
to
a
nature
whyy
activities,
his
background
and
the
restrictions
imposed
upon,
this
was
put
in
the
record
of
the
request
on
the
supreme
court
of
new
jersey
before
argument
in
that
court.
in
the
last
two
pages
list
programs
which
were
geared
strictly
to
new
jersey
people
with
--
to
show
the
court
what
benefits
were
confertly
in
census
in
new
jersey.
that
statement
also
shows
that
whyy
has
supported
completely
by
grants
and
donations
from
the
federal
state
and
local
governments,
by
appellant
from
school
district,
by
grants
from
foundations,
by
donations
from
corporations
and
by
general
public,
all
these
donations
are
tax
deductible.
the
grantors
of
whyy
who
are
unpaid
they
are
either
public
officials
in
the
states
involved
where
they
are
civic
leaders.
whyy
is
exempt
from
federal
state
and
local
tax
as
except
to
this
particularly
tax
and
a
few
tax
they
paid
because
they
were
de
minimis.
now
all
the
broadcast
and
all
the
services
performed
by
whyy
are
supported
by
the
source
that
i
mentioned.
they
have
no
sales
of
advertising.
they
have
no
commercials.
this
is
a
--
which
you
might
call
100%
two-way
charity
operation,
everything
is
given
to
whyy
for
nothing
and
everything
we
do
is
done
for
nothing.
and
on
this
circumstance
it's
obvious
that
it
is
very
important
that
we
receive
every
proper
economic
advantage
so
that
this
station
can
survive.
tax
involved
in
this
case
are
substantial,
excuse
me,
at
least
they
are
substantial
to
whyy.
the
assessed
valuation
of
the
property
which
the
state
seeks
to
tax
is
$113,000.00.
there
are
four
years
involved
in
this
case.
this
case
involved
only
1964
but
this
result
will
govern
1965,
1966,
and
1967.
mr.
james
m.
marsh
it's
partly
real
property
and
partly
personal
property
and
all
the
realty
in
new
jersey
plus
the
site
and
everything
that's
in
it
as
i
understand.
mr.
james
m.
marsh
the
land,
the
buildings,
--
mr.
james
m.
marsh
the
equipment,
yes
sir.
and
during
the
course
of
this
case,
the
new
jersey
legislature
amended
that
statute
to
grant
this
exemption
to
non-profit
educational
television
station.
so
for
1968
on,
we
have
no
problem
but
we
do
have
this
problem
with
these
four
years
and
they're
substantial
amount
of
money.
mr.
james
m.
marsh
no
sir,
we're
happy
with
the
amended
statute
and
we
were
saying
we
have
it
retroactive
or
take
some
other
remedial
action
but
strictly
prospect
on
operation.
now
in
new
jersey
we
run
the
gambit
of
the
administrative
proceedings
that
time
strictly
on
the
ground
that
whyy
having
been
domesticated
was
in
a
fact
that
domestic
corporation
had
other
language
in
the
statute
could
be
grant
this
exemption.
the
new
jersey
administrative
officials
didn't
see
it
that
way
in
order
the
supreme
court
in
new
jersey
and
they
went
solely
in
that
ground.
the
federal
postures
issue
was
not
raised
until
the
case
in
the
supreme
court
in
new
jersey.
that
court
then
asked
for
the
statement,
which
i
mentioned
which
is
at
pages
47
to
67
at
the
record.
so
they
have
a
full
background
to
make
their
judgment.
unfortunately,
when
they
made
their
judgment
on
equal
protection
argument,
they
made
it
very
summarily
and
very
abruptly.
they
did
not
discuss
or
distinguished
any
of
the
cases
in
this
court
up
to
that
time.
they
simply
said
that
there
is
a
presumption
of
validity
of
a
statute
and
they
indicated
--
they
believe
there
is
a
possibility
of
different
treatment
of
foreign
nonprofit
corporations
and
local
domestic
nonprofit
corporations.
now
we
feel
this
is
clearly
wrong
under
the
case
this
court
which
we
are
citing
could
starting
with
southern
railway,
where
this
court
said
that
a
division
of
corporations
entered
domestic
and
foreign
for
purposes
of
taxation,
taxing
the
foreign
and
not
taxing
the
domestic
on
the
same
property
and
in
the
same
operation
is
unconstitutional.
and
this
court
has
said
many
times
that
once
a
corporation
has
been
admitted
is
entitled
the
exactly
the
same
treatment
as
every
other
corporation
in
the
same
class
within
a
state.
now
the
idea
was
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
expressed
that
faced
with
a
discriminatory
statute,
a
court
can
say
well
the
legislature
had
some
basis
where
it
could
have
had
some
basis.
you
could
imagine
the
basis
in
which
they
would
make
a
finding
that
there
will
be
some
reason
for
not
taxing
domestic
corporations
and
taxing
foreign
as
also
disowned
by
this
court.
as
long
ago
as
the
gulf,
colorado
&
santa
fe
case
in
165
u.s.
where
mr.
justice
stewart
said
that
“to
so
treat
the
due
process
and
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
would
make
a
mere
rope
of
sand
out
of
those
clause
and
would
afford
no
protection
against
state
action.”
i
would
think
they
say
an
apt
description
of
what
happened
and
in
this
case
and
addition
to
that
the
question
is
whether
or
not
to
accept
a
particular
group
of
taxpayers
or
group
of
corporations
from
taxation
is
the
legislative
function.
the
new
jersey
legislature
made
this
judgment
and
that
statute
which
was
set
forth
on
page
26
of
the
record,
page
26
of
our
brief
rather
and
pages
14
and
15
of
the
record.
that
statute
provides
that
a
nonprofit
at
a
foreign
corporation
of
any
kind
can
qualify
new
jersey
and
get
a
certificate
telling
it
to
offer
in
new
jersey
simply
by
following
certain
information
about
its
composition,
its
capital
and
nature
of
its
activities,
and
find
certain
documents.
the
whyy
did
this
and
it's
our
view
that
the
state
supreme
court
cannot
now
retroactively
in
effect
to
kind
of
take
back
that
certificate.
because
they
have
a
thing
that
have
more
day
have
been
requested
perhaps
the
legislature
would
have
come
to
a
different
conclusion
what
they
have
done
is
kind
of
dream
up
a
phantom
session
of
the
legislature.
and
said
“well
these
faults
probably
could
have
found
some
basis
and
if
they
could
have
why
then,
they
would
have”
and
we
have
a
right
to
say,
“you
have
no
right
to
complain.”
and
not
with
a
--
mr.
james
m.
marsh
for
future
years,
we
are
exempt,
as
i
understand.
mr.
james
m.
marsh
yes,
for
future
years
--
mr.
james
m.
marsh
the
question
of
the
technical
compliance
with
the
new
jersey
statute
was
not
decided
by
supreme
court
in
new
jersey.
mr.
james
m.
marsh
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
m.
marsh
it
all
requires
as
a
nonprofit
educational
television
station.
that
is
exactly
what
we
are.
mr.
james
m.
marsh
there
will
be
no
prob
--
this
law
had
been
on
the
books
when
this
case
came
up
i
think
even
the
supreme
court
of
new
jersey
would
have
grant
us
an
exemption.
now,
we
feel
that
with
all
due
respect
to
that
court
hat
they
have
ignored
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
telling
us
to
the
same
protection.
once
we
have
been
admitted
the
new
jersey
legislature
made
that
judgment
that
we
could
be
admitted
by
doing
certain
things,
which
we
did.
now
we
say
that
the
supreme
court
has
no
right
to
turn
around
and
say
“well
have
they
done
otherwise
you
might
have
gotten
a
different
answer.”
we
feel
that
their
ruling
would
produced
a
patent
violation
of
the
equal
protection
clause
and
that
should
be
reversed.
i
would
like
to
reserve
any
time
i
have
for
any
necessary
rebuttal.
mr.
james
m.
marsh
i
would
like
to
view
it
that
way
but
i
don't
--
it's
hard
to
say
what,
for
one
legislature
to
decide
what
other
legislature
meant
where
they
correcting
it
or
where
they
changing
it.
i
don't,
i
really
don't
know,
i
would
--
my
view
would
be
that
they
were
saying,
this
is
what
i
should
have
met
all
along,
we
would
not
have
passed
an
unconstitutional
statute
that
we're
satisfied
that
it
was
unconstitutional.
but
there
is
nothing
in
the
face
of
the
statute
to
tell
you
that
--
mr.
james
m.
marsh
and
we
have
no
way
of
knowing
but
we
certainly
feel
that
had
this
law
been
affected
at
that
time,
there
was
no
doubt
about
our
exemption.
and
we
feel
that
the
decision
of
this
court
the
other
statute,
which
by
his
terms
is
good
as
in
the
exemption
and
by
its
interpretation,
excludes
an
exemption.
we
feel
it's
clearly
bad
and
should
be
offset.
mr.
james
m.
marsh
the
dollar
amounts
of
the
taxes
are
not
on
the
record
while
i
have
talked
to
my
adversary
and
we
have
agreed
it
is
in
the
near
$60,000.00
for
these
four
years.
mr.
james
m.
marsh
that's
right
mr.
justice
stewart,
it's
prospective
only.
mr.
james
m.
marsh
i
think
that's
right,
mr.
justice
white,
it
says
educational
television
stations.
mr.
james
m.
marsh
thanks.
mr.
james
m.
marsh
may
i
please
the
court.
mr.
james
m.
marsh
just
to
clarify
a
few
matters.
first,
mr.
justice
brennan's
problems
about
the
attorney
general,
i
think
it
may
be
explained
by
raising
the
facts
that
during
this
litigation
and
up
to
today.
the
attorney
general
of
new
jersey
is
the
member
of
the
board
of
whyy
which
might
have
made
this
participation
a
little
awkward.
the
other
problem
about
the
statue,
the
statute
we
talked
about
was
passed
after
decision
of
the
superior
court
of
new
jersey
but
before
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
in
new
jersey.
so
it
was,
i
supposed
you
say
was
repealed
or
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
in
new
jersey
but
it
had
no
bearing
on
the
--
mr.
james
m.
marsh
no,
it
does
not
but
as
far
as
davis
passage
in
this
relation,
the
supreme
court
of
new
jersey
decision
had
none
--
mr.
james
m.
marsh
yes,
it
intervened
between
any
superior
court's
decision
and
the
supreme
court's
decision.
so
the
supreme
court
had
nothing
to
do
with
it.
as
far
as
the
statement
that
we
should
have
been
required
to
incorporate
in
new
jersey
and
new
jersey
legislature
carry
that
they
don't
make
any
sense
in
provision.
and
we
have
comply
with
all
the
laws
and
all
the
regulations
i
did
put
down
and
we
feel
we
have
fully
qualified
for
all
the
rights
approach
that
nonprofit
corporations
have
in
new
jersey.
this
is
also
the
sense
between
the
kentucky
case
which
i
myself
went
out
to
the
court
in
my
brief.
because
in
that
case
you
had
it
questioned
--
a
kentucky
corporation
which
had
not
qualified
in
illinois,
which
could
not
possibly
spend
any
money
in
illinois
couldn't
get
any
benefits
to
people
of
illinois.
and
illinois
said
rightly,
i
think
that
they
didn't
have
to
give
them
this
inheritance
free
of
tax
like
its
quite
duly
case
in
every
possible
respect.
the
only
other
question
i
want
to
talk
to
you
on
is
the
question
of
the
exemption.
first
of
all
the
requirement
that
you
applied
for
this
exemption
is
not
in
this
exemption
section
it's
in
another
quite
general
section
of
the
statute.
secondly,
the
duty
raise
is
place
on
the
assessor
not
on
a
taxpayer.
thirdly,
there
was
substantial
compliance
in
that
and
we
didn't
like
a
request
on
november
7,
1963
i
supposed
to
november
1st,
which
would
be
the
date
of
the
law.
and
the
final
thing,
probably
the
most
significant
thing,
is
the
supreme
court
in
new
jersey
did
not
decide
the
case
on
that
ground
and
now
had
they
thought
much
of
it,
it's
the
same
scenario
it
would
have.
because
they
could
have
avoided
it
deciding
in
federal
constitution
issue
by
just
simply
telling
us
whatever
your
rights
where
you
gave
them
up,
they
didn't
do
that.
i
guess
that's
very
significant
and
i
submit
that
we
have
comply
well
in
the
laws
in
new
jersey
and
required
to
be
treated
as
a
new
jersey
corporation
for
this
purpose
and
otherwise
would
be
a
protection,
with
this
the
judgment
should
be
reversed.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
james
m.
marsh
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
from
the
supreme
court
of
new
jersey.
it
presents
a
single
clear
issue
of
constitutional
law,
which
is
whether
or
not
a
state
can
permit
its
municipalities
to
tax
certain
property
used
within
new
jersey
by
a
foreign,
nonprofit
corporation
which
has
qualified
and
based
in
new
jersey,
and
at
the
same
time,
permit
them
to
exempt
from
taxation
same
type
of
property
when
used
by
a
new
jersey
nonprofit
corporation.
we
believe
of
course
that
is
denial
of
equal
protection
as
that
term
is
now
applied
by
this
court
over
the
years.
now
the
appellant
here
whyy
was
one
brought
under
pennsylvania
law
in
1952.
it's
also
license
by
the
federal
communications
commission
for
the
transmission
of
noncommercial
radio
and
tv
programs.
it
is
subject
to
great
many
restrictions
by
both
the
state
and
the
fcc.
it
is
not
permitted
to
sell
time,
it
is
not
permitted
to
accept
advertising,
it
cannot
engage
in
any
activity
which
inures
profit
to
any
corporation
or
person,
it's
not
permitted
to
pay
dividends.
the
property
involved
in
this
case
is
the
only
property
which,
whyy
has
in
new
jersey.
as
a
site
where
there
is
a
tower
for
transmission
of
television
programs
on
the
channel
12,
the
site
must
be
personally
involved
is
what
lead
to
this
case.
all
the
programs
in
whyy
from
channel
12
are
educational,
cultural
or
recreational.
they
broadcast
daily
for
the
benefit
of
schools
in
a
number
of
school
district
in
the
three
or
four
states
involved
including
a
number
in
new
jersey.
they
have
other
programs
in
evenings
and
on
saturdays.
the
population
of
the
area
reached
by
channel
12
was
about
8
million
people
and
the
record
shows
that
about
29.5%
are
located
in
new
jersey.
now
at
pages
47
to
67
there
is
a
detailed
statement
as
to
a
nature
whyy
activities,
his
background
and
the
restrictions
imposed
upon,
this
was
put
in
the
record
of
the
request
on
the
supreme
court
of
new
jersey
before
argument
in
that
court.
in
the
last
two
pages
list
programs
which
were
geared
strictly
to
new
jersey
people
with
--
to
show
the
court
what
benefits
were
confertly
in
census
in
new
jersey.
that
statement
also
shows
that
whyy
has
supported
completely
by
grants
and
donations
from
the
federal
state
and
local
governments,
by
appellant
from
school
district,
by
grants
from
foundations,
by
donations
from
corporations
and
by
general
public,
all
these
donations
are
tax
deductible.
the
grantors
of
whyy
who
are
unpaid
they
are
either
public
officials
in
the
states
involved
where
they
are
civic
leaders.
whyy
is
exempt
from
federal
state
and
local
tax
as
except
to
this
particularly
tax
and
a
few
tax
they
paid
because
they
were
de
minimis.
now
all
the
broadcast
and
all
the
services
performed
by
whyy
are
supported
by
the
source
that
i
mentioned.
they
have
no
sales
of
advertising.
they
have
no
commercials.
this
is
a
--
which
you
might
call
100%
two-way
charity
operation,
everything
is
given
to
whyy
for
nothing
and
everything
we
do
is
done
for
nothing.
and
on
this
circumstance
it's
obvious
that
it
is
very
important
that
we
receive
every
proper
economic
advantage
so
that
this
station
can
survive.
tax
involved
in
this
case
are
substantial,
excuse
me,
at
least
they
are
substantial
to
whyy.
the
assessed
valuation
of
the
property
which
the
state
seeks
to
tax
is
$113,000.00.
there
are
four
years
involved
in
this
case.
this
case
involved
only
1964
but
this
result
will
govern
1965,
1966,
and
1967.
mr.
james
m.
marsh
it's
partly
real
property
and
partly
personal
property
and
all
the
realty
in
new
jersey
plus
the
site
and
everything
that's
in
it
as
i
understand.
mr.
james
m.
marsh
the
land,
the
buildings,
--
mr.
james
m.
marsh
the
equipment,
yes
sir.
and
during
the
course
of
this
case,
the
new
jersey
legislature
amended
that
statute
to
grant
this
exemption
to
non-profit
educational
television
station.
so
for
1968
on,
we
have
no
problem
but
we
do
have
this
problem
with
these
four
years
and
they're
substantial
amount
of
money.
mr.
james
m.
marsh
no
sir,
we're
happy
with
the
amended
statute
and
we
were
saying
we
have
it
retroactive
or
take
some
other
remedial
action
but
strictly
prospect
on
operation.
now
in
new
jersey
we
run
the
gambit
of
the
administrative
proceedings
that
time
strictly
on
the
ground
that
whyy
having
been
domesticated
was
in
a
fact
that
domestic
corporation
had
other
language
in
the
statute
could
be
grant
this
exemption.
the
new
jersey
administrative
officials
didn't
see
it
that
way
in
order
the
supreme
court
in
new
jersey
and
they
went
solely
in
that
ground.
the
federal
postures
issue
was
not
raised
until
the
case
in
the
supreme
court
in
new
jersey.
that
court
then
asked
for
the
statement,
which
i
mentioned
which
is
at
pages
47
to
67
at
the
record.
so
they
have
a
full
background
to
make
their
judgment.
unfortunately,
when
they
made
their
judgment
on
equal
protection
argument,
they
made
it
very
summarily
and
very
abruptly.
they
did
not
discuss
or
distinguished
any
of
the
cases
in
this
court
up
to
that
time.
they
simply
said
that
there
is
a
presumption
of
validity
of
a
statute
and
they
indicated
--
they
believe
there
is
a
possibility
of
different
treatment
of
foreign
nonprofit
corporations
and
local
domestic
nonprofit
corporations.
now
we
feel
this
is
clearly
wrong
under
the
case
this
court
which
we
are
citing
could
starting
with
southern
railway,
where
this
court
said
that
a
division
of
corporations
entered
domestic
and
foreign
for
purposes
of
taxation,
taxing
the
foreign
and
not
taxing
the
domestic
on
the
same
property
and
in
the
same
operation
is
unconstitutional.
and
this
court
has
said
many
times
that
once
a
corporation
has
been
admitted
is
entitled
the
exactly
the
same
treatment
as
every
other
corporation
in
the
same
class
within
a
state.
now
the
idea
was
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
expressed
that
faced
with
a
discriminatory
statute,
a
court
can
say
well
the
legislature
had
some
basis
where
it
could
have
had
some
basis.
you
could
imagine
the
basis
in
which
they
would
make
a
finding
that
there
will
be
some
reason
for
not
taxing
domestic
corporations
and
taxing
foreign
as
also
disowned
by
this
court.
as
long
ago
as
the
gulf,
colorado
&
santa
fe
case
in
165
u.s.
where
mr.
justice
stewart
said
that
“to
so
treat
the
due
process
and
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
would
make
a
mere
rope
of
sand
out
of
those
clause
and
would
afford
no
protection
against
state
action.”
i
would
think
they
say
an
apt
description
of
what
happened
and
in
this
case
and
addition
to
that
the
question
is
whether
or
not
to
accept
a
particular
group
of
taxpayers
or
group
of
corporations
from
taxation
is
the
legislative
function.
the
new
jersey
legislature
made
this
judgment
and
that
statute
which
was
set
forth
on
page
26
of
the
record,
page
26
of
our
brief
rather
and
pages
14
and
15
of
the
record.
that
statute
provides
that
a
nonprofit
at
a
foreign
corporation
of
any
kind
can
qualify
new
jersey
and
get
a
certificate
telling
it
to
offer
in
new
jersey
simply
by
following
certain
information
about
its
composition,
its
capital
and
nature
of
its
activities,
and
find
certain
documents.
the
whyy
did
this
and
it's
our
view
that
the
state
supreme
court
cannot
now
retroactively
in
effect
to
kind
of
take
back
that
certificate.
because
they
have
a
thing
that
have
more
day
have
been
requested
perhaps
the
legislature
would
have
come
to
a
different
conclusion
what
they
have
done
is
kind
of
dream
up
a
phantom
session
of
the
legislature.
and
said
“well
these
faults
probably
could
have
found
some
basis
and
if
they
could
have
why
then,
they
would
have”
and
we
have
a
right
to
say,
“you
have
no
right
to
complain.”
and
not
with
a
--
mr.
james
m.
marsh
for
future
years,
we
are
exempt,
as
i
understand.
mr.
james
m.
marsh
yes,
for
future
years
--
mr.
james
m.
marsh
the
question
of
the
technical
compliance
with
the
new
jersey
statute
was
not
decided
by
supreme
court
in
new
jersey.
mr.
james
m.
marsh
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
m.
marsh
it
all
requires
as
a
nonprofit
educational
television
station.
that
is
exactly
what
we
are.
mr.
james
m.
marsh
there
will
be
no
prob
--
this
law
had
been
on
the
books
when
this
case
came
up
i
think
even
the
supreme
court
of
new
jersey
would
have
grant
us
an
exemption.
now,
we
feel
that
with
all
due
respect
to
that
court
hat
they
have
ignored
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
telling
us
to
the
same
protection.
once
we
have
been
admitted
the
new
jersey
legislature
made
that
judgment
that
we
could
be
admitted
by
doing
certain
things,
which
we
did.
now
we
say
that
the
supreme
court
has
no
right
to
turn
around
and
say
“well
have
they
done
otherwise
you
might
have
gotten
a
different
answer.”
we
feel
that
their
ruling
would
produced
a
patent
violation
of
the
equal
protection
clause
and
that
should
be
reversed.
i
would
like
to
reserve
any
time
i
have
for
any
necessary
rebuttal.
mr.
james
m.
marsh
i
would
like
to
view
it
that
way
but
i
don't
--
it's
hard
to
say
what,
for
one
legislature
to
decide
what
other
legislature
meant
where
they
correcting
it
or
where
they
changing
it.
i
don't,
i
really
don't
know,
i
would
--
my
view
would
be
that
they
were
saying,
this
is
what
i
should
have
met
all
along,
we
would
not
have
passed
an
unconstitutional
statute
that
we're
satisfied
that
it
was
unconstitutional.
but
there
is
nothing
in
the
face
of
the
statute
to
tell
you
that
--
mr.
james
m.
marsh
and
we
have
no
way
of
knowing
but
we
certainly
feel
that
had
this
law
been
affected
at
that
time,
there
was
no
doubt
about
our
exemption.
and
we
feel
that
the
decision
of
this
court
the
other
statute,
which
by
his
terms
is
good
as
in
the
exemption
and
by
its
interpretation,
excludes
an
exemption.
we
feel
it's
clearly
bad
and
should
be
offset.
mr.
james
m.
marsh
the
dollar
amounts
of
the
taxes
are
not
on
the
record
while
i
have
talked
to
my
adversary
and
we
have
agreed
it
is
in
the
near
$60,000.00
for
these
four
years.
mr.
james
m.
marsh
that's
right
mr.
justice
stewart,
it's
prospective
only.
mr.
james
m.
marsh
i
think
that's
right,
mr.
justice
white,
it
says
educational
television
stations.
mr.
james
m.
marsh
thanks.
mr.
james
m.
marsh
may
i
please
the
court.
mr.
james
m.
marsh
just
to
clarify
a
few
matters.
first,
mr.
justice
brennan's
problems
about
the
attorney
general,
i
think
it
may
be
explained
by
raising
the
facts
that
during
this
litigation
and
up
to
today.
the
attorney
general
of
new
jersey
is
the
member
of
the
board
of
whyy
which
might
have
made
this
participation
a
little
awkward.
the
other
problem
about
the
statue,
the
statute
we
talked
about
was
passed
after
decision
of
the
superior
court
of
new
jersey
but
before
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
in
new
jersey.
so
it
was,
i
supposed
you
say
was
repealed
or
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
in
new
jersey
but
it
had
no
bearing
on
the
--
mr.
james
m.
marsh
no,
it
does
not
but
as
far
as
davis
passage
in
this
relation,
the
supreme
court
of
new
jersey
decision
had
none
--
mr.
james
m.
marsh
yes,
it
intervened
between
any
superior
court's
decision
and
the
supreme
court's
decision.
so
the
supreme
court
had
nothing
to
do
with
it.
as
far
as
the
statement
that
we
should
have
been
required
to
incorporate
in
new
jersey
and
new
jersey
legislature
carry
that
they
don't
make
any
sense
in
provision.
and
we
have
comply
with
all
the
laws
and
all
the
regulations
i
did
put
down
and
we
feel
we
have
fully
qualified
for
all
the
rights
approach
that
nonprofit
corporations
have
in
new
jersey.
this
is
also
the
sense
between
the
kentucky
case
which
i
myself
went
out
to
the
court
in
my
brief.
because
in
that
case
you
had
it
questioned
--
a
kentucky
corporation
which
had
not
qualified
in
illinois,
which
could
not
possibly
spend
any
money
in
illinois
couldn't
get
any
benefits
to
people
of
illinois.
and
illinois
said
rightly,
i
think
that
they
didn't
have
to
give
them
this
inheritance
free
of
tax
like
its
quite
duly
case
in
every
possible
respect.
the
only
other
question
i
want
to
talk
to
you
on
is
the
question
of
the
exemption.
first
of
all
the
requirement
that
you
applied
for
this
exemption
is
not
in
this
exemption
section
it's
in
another
quite
general
section
of
the
statute.
secondly,
the
duty
raise
is
place
on
the
assessor
not
on
a
taxpayer.
thirdly,
there
was
substantial
compliance
in
that
and
we
didn't
like
a
request
on
november
7,
1963
i
supposed
to
november
1st,
which
would
be
the
date
of
the
law.
and
the
final
thing,
probably
the
most
significant
thing,
is
the
supreme
court
in
new
jersey
did
not
decide
the
case
on
that
ground
and
now
had
they
thought
much
of
it,
it's
the
same
scenario
it
would
have.
because
they
could
have
avoided
it
deciding
in
federal
constitution
issue
by
just
simply
telling
us
whatever
your
rights
where
you
gave
them
up,
they
didn't
do
that.
i
guess
that's
very
significant
and
i
submit
that
we
have
comply
well
in
the
laws
in
new
jersey
and
required
to
be
treated
as
a
new
jersey
corporation
for
this
purpose
and
otherwise
would
be
a
protection,
with
this
the
judgment
should
be
reversed.
thank
you
very
much.
