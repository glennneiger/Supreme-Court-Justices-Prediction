justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
are
you
claiming
on
an
implied
standard?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
by
implied
contract,
don't
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that
was
the
ryan
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
would
that
--
why
would
not
that
carry
over
to
the
stevedore
if
he
was
made
liable
by
reason
of
the
neglect
of
the
ship?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
the
court
held
it
was
implied
contract.
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
the
ryan
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
understand
it
here,
an
employee
of
the
ship
--
of
the
stevedoring
company
was
killed
by
an
alleged
neglect
of
the
ship.
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
had
gone
in
there
as
a
stevedore's
employee.
now,
under
the
ryan
case,
what
would
happen
if
he
should
sue
and
get
a
judgment
against
the
ship?
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
suppose
in
reality
it
was
neglect
of
the
ship
and
not
the
neglect
of
the
stevedore?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
is
this
right
with
the
controversy,
i'm
trying
to
get
just
what
it
is.
the
man
was
killed,
why
sue?
did
she
get
something
from
the
stevedore?
justice
hugo
l.
black
by
the
stevedore?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
the
stevedore
sets
up
a
claim
against
the
ship?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
says
i've
had
to
pay
under
the
law
because
of
your
neglect
and
i
want
you
to
indemnify
is
that
what
the
case
is
about?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
whole
thing.
what
law
was
it,
it
was
passed
by
congress
after
the
ryan
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
automatic
assignment
from
the
injured
man
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
his
employer.
justice
hugo
l.
black
assignment
of
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
against
the
ship?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
now
why
can't
they
recover
on
those
things?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
therefore
say
that
the
shipowner,
the
stevedoring
company
would
be
limited
to
just
what
the
employee
could
get
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
from
his
employer,
the
stevedore.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that's
your
issue
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
they
admit
that,
the
other
side?
justice
hugo
l.
black
for
that
all
they
claim?
justice
hugo
l.
black
not
for
the
death
of
the
man
though
that
he'd
have
to
pay,
does
he?
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
what
is
it
he
claims?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
believe
or
what
--
why
would
he
have
to
pay
that
if
he
is
limited
--?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
man
is
limited
to
$30,000.00?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
are
you
just
claiming
if
he's
proceeding
in
the
wrong
way?
is
that
what
the
price
to
pay?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
admit
liability
for
$30,000.00.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
are
claiming
that
he
is
not
bringing
suit
in
the
right
manner?
that's
likely
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
if
it's
subrogated
to
him,
why
hasn't
he?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
on
the
subrogation
idea?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
has
the
employ
--
has
the
stevedoring
company
been
paid,
what
it's
entitled
to
do
with
subrogee?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
said
they
could
sue
you
directly?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
can
they
get
it
from
him?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
you
mean
it
--
you
pay
the
employee
for
damages.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
they
have
to
sue
him
for
damages.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
looks
to
me
like
under
your
plan,
stevedoring
company
is
going
to
lose
its
right
to
recover
which
you
say
it
has
as
a
subrogee?
justice
hugo
l.
black
maybe
because
i
just
stand
on
the
standard.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
must
confess,
i
don't
quite
understand
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
oh,
it's
my
mine.
and
as
i
--
i
just
can't
quite
understand
the
defense.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
the
facts
are
that
the
--
this
woman
is
getting
so
much
a
week,
now
isn't
she?
justice
hugo
l.
black
under
the
longshoremen's
act?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
whatever
is
paid,
i
understand
the
amendment
to
the
law
use
the
stevedoring
company
a
right
to
be
treated,
subrogated
to
the
employee's
claims.
he
--
and
therefore
the
employer,
the
stevedore
would
be
entirely
recover
from
somebody.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
justice
hugo
l.
black
oh,
i'm
sure
this
is
just
a
suit
between
the
insurance
company
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
all
the
man
could
be
--
or
so
the
stevedoring
company
will
be
held
liable,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
70,000.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
the
subrogation
you
are
talking
about
is
that
--
is
the
subrogation
under
the
longshoremen's
act
which
does
not
give
$30,000.00?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
are
they
claiming
if
there
was
an
implied
agreement
to
compensate
them
equip
--
give
them
a
complete
equipment
anything
they
had
to
pay
out
on
account
of
that
inquiry
to
the
man.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
their
claim?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
and
we
have
held
that
there
is
an
implied
contract
on
the
part
of
the
stevedoring
company?
do
you
compensate
the
ship
for
any
injuries
brought
by
its
nature?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
now
why
should
not
that
imply
more?it
exists
on
both
sides.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
was
wondering
why
if
this
court
can
find
an
implied
contract
in
favor
of
the
ship
--
in
favor
of
the
ship
against
the
stevedoring
company
for
it's
--
not
doing
anything
they
can
didn't
it?
that
--
may
cause
us
damage,
why
can't
the
court
find
the
same
implied
contract
on
the
other
side?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
(voice
overlap)?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
that
--
that's
only
a
matter
of
semantics.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
if
they
do,
you
would
admit
liability,
wouldn't
you?
if
the
law
does
make
that
a
--
give
liability
against
the
ship
on
that
basis,
would
you
deny
liability?
justice
hugo
l.
black
wasn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
--
may
i
ask
you
just
this
one
question.
suppose
they
had
made
a
contract
with
the
stevedoring
company
and
says,
"you
are
to
bring
your
man
over
this
gangway,
this
water
freight
right
here."
he
brings
him
over.
it
is
discovered
that
was
the
knowledge
of
the
owner
of
the
ship
that
the
thing
has
been
so
defective,
that
is
absolutely
bound
to
break,
let
him
go
in
the
sea.
and
it
broke
and
went
into
the
sea
and
was
drowned.
what
about
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
i
suppose
that
stood
in
the
way
of
the
stevedore
any
protection
because
of
the
decision
by
this
court
that
had
held
that
he
must
be
--
indemnify
the
shipowner
even
though
it's
the
shipowner's
negligence.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
rather
thought
it
was
in
the
ryan

i'd
