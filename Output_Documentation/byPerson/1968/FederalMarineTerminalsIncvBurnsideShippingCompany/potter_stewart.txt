what
your
--
the
shipowner
is
always
going
to
be
liable
to
the
injured
workman?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
actually
something
very
close
to
absolute
viability
under
the
unseaworthiness
doctrine.
justice
potter
stewart
plus
viability
for
negligence
i
suppose
if
--
and
this
i
should
i
think
would
operate
it
something
of
a
sanction
against
the
shipowner
to
keep
it
seaworthy
and
the
ship,
safe
ship,
wouldn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
when
i
was
--
if
any
--
this
theory
of
yours,
does
any
court
accepted
it
ever?
justice
potter
stewart
i
mean
this
theory
of
yours
of
recovery
over
it.
justice
potter
stewart
by
the
employer
who
has
to
pay
under
the
longshoremen's

compensation
act
--
justice

--
recovering
over

(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
your
theory
has
never
been
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
much
less
--
much
less
prevail,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
you
do
have
a
--
of
course,
under
the
statute
rights,
certain
rights
of
subrogation,
don't
you?
justice
potter
stewart
and
it's
only
because
of
the
statute
that
you're
liable
at
all,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
you
were
liable
with
--
justice
potter
stewart
it's
only
because
the
statute
that
you're
liable
without
fault.
justice
potter
stewart
isn't
that
true?
justice
potter
stewart
how
did
the
hugev
case
arise?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
here
that's
not
this
case.
but
that's
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
now,
are
you
telling
about
this
case
or
the
hugev
case
in
described
--
in
that
description?
justice
potter
stewart
i
beg
your
pardon.
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
now
how
did
the
hugev
case
arise?
justice
potter
stewart
and
what
--
then
what
happened?
justice
potter
stewart
against
the
shipowner?
justice
potter
stewart
all
we
have
before
us
in
this
case
and
you'd
--
you
tell
me
if
i'm
mistaken
because
maybe
i
am.i
had
understood
that
all
we
have
before
us
this
case
was
the
--
the
grant
of
a
summary
judgment
to
your
client,
on
the
petitioner's
counterclaim,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
as
a
matter
of
law.
justice
potter
stewart
the
court
denied
a
counterclaim
--
well,
on
the
other
branch
of
the
case.
justice
potter
stewart
did
they
deny
the
summary
judgment
on
the
other
branch
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
denied
of
summary
judgment
on
the
claim
that
granted
a
summary

counterclaim
as
a

holding
one
other
things
that
the
federal
statute
was
controlling
in
that
situation
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
which
granted
subrogation
justice
potter
stewart
do
i
misunderstand
what's
it
about?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
factual
difference
is
--
the
difference
between
$30,000.00
and
$70,000.00
because
of
the
impact
of
the
illinois
wrongful
death
statute.
justice
potter
stewart
the
illinois
wrongful
death
statute.
justice
potter
stewart
although
it
hasn't
been
definitely
decided
that
that
is
applicable
to
this
claim,
has
it?
i
noticed
the
court
of
appeals
from
the
seventh
circuit
put
it
as
a
quite
a
tentative
conclusion.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
perhaps
not
but
it
hasn't
been
decided,
has
it?
justice
potter
stewart
in
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
no,
exactly.

whether
or
not
the

was
a
