mr.
paul
mccambridge
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
first
direct
my
answer
to
mr.
justice
harlan's
inquiry
about
whether
the
vessel
was
in
time
charter
or
whether
the
owner
was
had
entered
into
some
contractual
relationship
with
the
stevedore.
the
answer
is
in
the
record.
there
was
an
allegation
in
the
liability
that
the
--
it's
on
--
it's
on
page
5
of
the
appendix
and
it's
paragraph
7
of
the
liable
in
which
we
alleged
that
the
work
of
the
respondent
was
being
performed
pursuant
to
agreement
between
the
respondent
and
the
time
charter
the
vessel,
federal
commerce
and
navigation
company
limited,
a
corporation
affiliated
with
the
respondent.
and
then
on
page
9
of
appendix
that
allegation
in
the
liable
is
admitted
so
i
don't
--
there's
too
much
question
that
the
vessel
was
under
time
charter
and
certainly
that
leads
us
right
into
--
immediately
one
of
the
principal
contentions
that
we
make
to
this
court.
and
that
which
that
there
is
no
affirmative
contract
between
the
stevedore
and
the
petitioner
or
--
i'm
sorry,
the
stevedore
and
the
shipowner
and
that
therefore
there
--
absent
a
contractual
relationship
certainly
there
cannot
be
any
implied
duties
running
from
the
shipowner
to
the
stevedore.
mr.
paul
mccambridge
i
--
yes
sir.
the
--
mr.
paul
mccambridge
yes
sir.
i
think
this
--
that
has
been
decided
--
mr.
paul
mccambridge
yes
sir
that
was
decided
by
this
court
that
the
shipowner
was
a
beneficiary
of
the
contract
between
the
stevedore
and
the
time
charterer,
i
think
it
was
reed
versus
yaka.
mr.
paul
mccambridge
well,
i
think
this
is
one
of
my
opponent's
principle,
the
things
that
really
trouble
him
under
the
--
he
feels
that
he
doesn't
have
an
equal
--
in
equal
side
of
shipowner
that
he
is
into
some
more
stringent
obligation
to
the
ship
rather
than
the
shipowner
is
to
the
stevedore.
the
petitioner's
counterclaim
upon
which
it
basis
its
claim
to
indemnity
is
based
upon
allegations
--
that
the
shipowner
was
negligent
and
the
shipowner
breached
a
duty
old
to
the
stevedore
that
it
furnish
its
longshoremen
employees
a
safe
place
to
work
onboard
the
vessel.
mr.
paul
mccambridge
that's
--
that
is
correct.
the
--
mr.
justice,
the
court
agreed
with
us
that
the
--
complaint
or
the
counterclaim
was
defective
as
a
matter
of
law
because
essentially
--
mr.
paul
mccambridge
--
stated
a
tortuous
claim
of
action
rather
than
one
under
contract.
mr.
paul
mccambridge
the
--
mr.
paul
mccambridge
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
mr.
paul
mccambridge
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
paul
mccambridge
that
--
mr.
paul
mccambridge
you
know
that's
correct
mr.
justice.
mr.
paul
mccambridge
this
is
a
question
that
is
not
really
before
this
court.
this
--
this
could
arise
and
it
will
arise
i
think
with
the
efforts
being
made
by
shipowners
to
contractually
--
i'm
sorry,
not
shipowners,
by
stevedores
to
contractually
work
their
way
out
of
the
predicament,
they
are
in
where
they
find
themselves
on
may
times
responding
for
what
they
consider
is
the
ship's
liability
in
this
area
of
the
law
where
the
shipowner
has
his
right
to
indemnity
against
the
stevedore
for
a
breach
of
its
worthy
of
safe
performance
in
the
service
of
a
vessel.
mr.
paul
mccambridge
no
sir,
no
sir,
this
is
ancillary
to
the
argument.
mr.
paul
mccambridge
that
is
correct.
that
is
one
--
that
is
--
mr.
paul
mccambridge
no
sir.
doesn't
matter
to
me.
the
judgment
were
deferred.
we
maintain
that
in
this
field
of
indemnity
in
longshoreman
personal
injury
cases,
indemnity
as
between
a
shipowner
and
a
stevedore
can
be
predicated
only
upon
a
contract
theory
of
warranty.
now
the
stevedores
counterclaim
in
--
for
indemnity
is
premised
entirely
upon
what
we
considered
to
be
tortuous
conduct
of
the
shipowner
which
we
say
is
not
--
they
are
duties
that
arise
by
virtue
of
any
contractual
relationships.
these
are
duties
which
exist
irrespective
of
any
contractual
relationship
between
the
shipowner
and
a
stevedore.
the
petitioner's
counterclaim
essentially
has
been
changed.
the
--
mr.
hough
has
mentioned
to
the
court
now
that
he
is
--
looking
only
for
a
reasonably
safe
place
for
his
stevedore
employees
to
work.
however
the
counterclaim
itself
specifically
says
it
is
based
upon
a
purported
duty
owed
by
the
shipowner
to
the
stevedore
to
furnish
a
safe
place
to
work.
now,
this
duty
to
furnish
a
safe
place
to
work
is
clearly
a
duty
owed
to
the
individual
longshoreman
working
onboard
the
boat
--
onboard
the
ship.
it's
the
--
if
the
species
of
liability
that
was
enunciated
without
thought.
it
was
enunciated
by
this
court
in
sieracki.
mr.
paul
mccambridge
i
would
say
--
mr.
paul
mccambridge
this
would
depend
upon
--
on
the
contract,
i
think
between
the
shipowner
and
the
stevedore
and
this
--
mr.
paul
mccambridge
well,
i
don't
think
in
this
particular
case.
i
thought
your
honor
or
the
court
was
referring
to
a
general
obligation.
no,
i
think
damage
--
mr.
paul
mccambridge
oh.
mr.
paul
mccambridge
there
--
there's
--
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
but
that
a
--
mr.
paul
mccambridge
because
this
is
a
duty
generally
owed
to
everyone.
this
duty
to
exercise
ordinary
care
which
is
spoken
of
by
the
petitioner
and
the
duty
to
warn
of
a
hidden
defect,
these
are
tort
obligations
and
this
court
in
ryan
admonished
that
in
ascertaining
a
shipowner's
liabilities
and
his
responsibilities
that
resort
may
not
be
had
to
principals
of
quasi
contract
or
to
principles
of
tort
liability.
mr.
justice
white,
you
addressed
yourself
to
the
question
what
duties
are
owed
to
and
when
it
comes
aboard
a
ship.
and
i
think
it
was
--
but
that
question
was
put
to
rest
in
the
kermarec
that
the
shipowner
owes
the
duties
to
use
ordinary
care
and
to
warn
of
hidden
defects.
he
owes
these
to
all
persons
who
are
lawfully
aboard
his
vessel.
therefore,
it
is
clear
i
believe,
it's
obvious
that
is
are
not
duties
arising
by
virtue
of
contract
but
that
they
are
independently
owed
duties
and
they're
tort
duties.
now
the
shipowner
of
the
--
pardon
me,
the
stevedore
has
brought
his
counterclaim
alleging
that
he
has
a
independent
cause
of
action
against
this
--
against
the
shipowner
under
contract
and
separate
from
the
action
which
is
given
him
under
the
longshoremen's
and
harbor
workers'
compensation
act.
he
says
that
section
33
of
that
act
provides
a
statutory
method
by
which
an
employer
may
be
reimbursed
for
the
compensation
expenditures
that
must
pay
for
--
to
its
injured
employees
but
he
says
because
the
act
is
not
specifically
barring
independent
cause
of
action
therefore
it
should
not
preclude
this
action.
we
feel
that
that
argument
is
false
or
at
least
the
fallacy
can
be
demonstrated
by
the
fact
that
prior
to
the
enactment
of
compensation
statutes
generally
in
this
statute
in
particular,
an
employer
no
--
had
no
non-negligent
liability
for
injuries
to
its
employees.
therefore
we
feel
that
proper
construction
of
the
statute
says
that
if
the
liability
standards
from
the
statutes
certainly,
then
the
corresponding
right
to
be
reimbursed
must
also
be
predicated
upon
that
statute.
the
--
and
i
feel
that
the
petitioner's
principal
complaint
here
is
that
he
doesn't
have
a
complete
remedy
under
the
longshoreman's
act
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
if
he
takes
under
that
act
is
the
assignee
or
the
subrogee
of
the
employee's
claim
then
he
will
be
limited
to
the
$30,000.00
maximum
recovery
which
was
permitted
under
illinois
law
in
effect
to
the
time
of
this
accident.
however,
it
is
maintained
that
the
employers
are
as
carriers,
insurance
carriers
potential
liability
is
$70,000.00
therefore
he
is
going
to
be
at
least
$40,000.00
out
of
pocket
rate
--
right
away
if
he
cannot
find
a
way
to
get
around
the
longshoremen's
and
harbor
workers'
compensation
act.
i
believe
that
this
question,
this
possibility
or
likelihood
that
there
would
be
cases
in
which
the
injured
employee
in
bringing
his
cause
of
action
against
a
negligent
third
party,
there
were
cases
in
which
he
would
recover
less
from
the
negligent
third
party
than
he
might
against
--
as
a
right
--
result
of
his
entitlement
to
compensation
benefits.
the
congress
covered
this
in
subsection
(f)
of
section
33.
it
isn't
in
the
appendix
but
it
is
in
the
petitioner's
brief
on
page
3
of
petitioner's
brief.
in
contemplating
what
would
occur
when
there
was
a
deficiency
in
the
employees
recovery,
the
congress
did
not
say
or
did
not
enact
that
the
employer
or
his
compensation
carrier
might
have
a
separate
cause
of
action
or
additional
cause
of
action
against
the
negligent
third
party
to
recover
the
deposit
that
it
might
have
from
its
right
to
be
reimbursed
from
--
or
to
recover
from
the
employees
recovery
but
instead
in
protecting
the
employee
it
said
that
the
employer
shall
pay
to
the
employee
any
deficiency
between
whatever
it
recovers
from
the
negligent
third
party
and
what
it
was
entitled
to
under
the
compensation
act.
the
act,
i
think
it's
designed
to
protect
employees
rather
than
employers
to
some
extent
anyway.
we
feel
that
the
congress
in
enacting
this
statute
specified
--
set
forth
a
particular
manner
in
which
reimbursement
could
be
achieved
by
the
employer
and
we
feel
that
the
mode
of
reimbursement
under
the
statute
is
very,
very
plain.
the
compensation
statutes
have
been
consistently
interpreted
to
cover
the
entire
area
of
industrial
injuries
and
basically
where
congress
has
provided
a
means
of
recovery,
i
don't
think
it's
necessary
to
go
outside
the
act.
i
think
the
recovery
must
be
found
within
the
four
corners
of
the
act.
we
certainly
we
feel
that
congress
did
not
intend
that
there
should
be
two
recoveries
for
a
single
tort.
the
second
aspect
of
this
question
is
before
the
court
is
how
can
the
--
or
what
rules
do
govern
this
area
of
indemnity?
i
think
it's
clear
from
the
decisions
of
this
court
beginning
with
ryan
going
under
weyerhaeuser,
crumady
that
indemnity
in
these
cases
must
be
predicated
entirely
upon
contractual
warranty.
mr.
paul
mccambridge
oh,
it
could
be
implied
or
expressed.
we
wouldn't
have
a
problem
where
it's
expressed
--
mr.
paul
mccambridge
yes
sir,
implied
warranty.
and
yet
there
--
mr.
paul
mccambridge
because
it
is
narrowly
a
contractual
duty
owed
to
the
--
mr.
paul
mccambridge
i'm
sorry,
maybe
i'm
misunderstood.
mr.
paul
mccambridge
yes
sir.
mr.
paul
mccambridge
yes
sir.
mr.
paul
mccambridge
the
shipowner
would
pay
the
judgment
and
following
--
mr.
paul
mccambridge
--
ryan
he
would
bring
his
indemnity
action
against
the
stevedore
employer
for
alleging
any
way
a
breach
of
the
stevedores
warranty
of
safe
performance.
mr.
paul
mccambridge
the
courts
in
following
this
court's
several
decisions
in
this
area
of
the
law
have
examined
the
shipowner's
conduct
in
the
context
of
whether
it
--
its
conduct
has
actively
hindered
or
whether
it
has
prevented
the
stevedore
from
safely
performing
its
services
to
the
vessel.
if
the
shipowner's
conduct
has
been
of
that
nature,
then
the
courts
merely
say
you
have
no
right
to
indemnity
for
the
amounts
that
you
have
paid
to
the
injured
employee.
you
cannot
recover
this
from
his
employer.
but
the
courts
have
not
gone
further.
they
have
not
created
the
--
you
might
say
the
reverse
warranty
or
the
reverse
obligation
that
the
--
there
might
be
an
affirmative
recovery
by
the
stevedore
against
the
shipowner
on
that
case.
mr.
paul
mccambridge
she
is
being
paid
compensation
benefits,
yes
sir.
mr.
paul
mccambridge
yes
sir.
mr.
paul
mccambridge
yes
sir.
mr.
paul
mccambridge
that
is
what
the
case
is
about,
yes
sir.
mr.
paul
mccambridge
they
amended
the
provision
in
section
33
required
an
automatic
assignment
of
employees'
cause
of
action
against
the
third
party
to
the
employer.
there's
an
automatic
assignment
under
the
old
act
--
mr.
paul
mccambridge
to
his
employer
or
--
mr.
paul
mccambridge
and
--
mr.
paul
mccambridge
his
cause
of
action
against
a
negligent
third
party.
mr.
paul
mccambridge
yes
sir.
mr.
paul
mccambridge
they
can
recover
on
that
assignment
as
a
matter
subrogation
mr.
justice
black
however
they
take
it
as
an
assigned
cause
of
action,
they
--
therefore
stand
in
the
employee's
stead
in
bringing
that
suit.
the
employee
is
limited
to
the
maximum
recovery
of
$30,000.00
which
was
in
effect,
under
the
illinois
wrongful
death
action
at
that
time.
mr.
paul
mccambridge
yes
sir.
mr.
paul
mccambridge
yes
sir.
mr.
paul
mccambridge
this
is
a
potential
liability
which
they
alleged.
yes
sir.
mr.
paul
mccambridge
yes
sir
and
in
the
--
mr.
paul
mccambridge
not
as
such.
this
--
following
this
court's
decisions,
i
think
in
the
late
1950's,
the
--
mr.
paul
mccambridge
this
--
can
borrow
the
concept
of
unseaworthiness.
mr.
paul
mccambridge
yes
sir.
mr.
paul
mccambridge
oh,
yes
sir.
that
is
their
--
that's
what
--
mr.
paul
mccambridge
i
cannot
speak
for
mr.
hough
but
what
he
wants
to
do
is
avoid
the
impact
of
the
compensation
act.
he
wants
to
say
regardless
of
whether
there's
a
compensation
act
or
not.
i
have
a
separate
cause
of
action
against
the
shipowner
because
the
shipowner
has
been
negligent.
mr.
paul
mccambridge
yes
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
paul
mccambridge
no,
not
for
the
death
of
the
man
--
mr.
paul
mccambridge
that
he
claims
that
he
has
been
damaged
in
the
amount
of
a
potential
liability
of
$70,000.00
which
represents
the
total
amount
of
compensation
benefits
which
may
have
to
be
paid
to
the
decedent's
widow
and
to
his
dependent
children.
mr.
paul
mccambridge
the
--
mr.
paul
mccambridge
the
man
is
limited
in
--
to
$30,000.00
in
his
recovery
against
me,
the
negligent
shipowner,
however,
under
the
act
there
is
no
maximum
limitation
then
--
mr.
paul
mccambridge
that
is
correct
sir.
there
is
no
--
an
action
--
mr.
paul
mccambridge
that
is
correct.
mr.
paul
mccambridge
i
think
that
is
an
aspect
of
the
case
mr.
justice
fortas.
the
--
mr.
paul
mccambridge
yes
sir.
we
--
we
say
that
the
petitioner,
stevedore
has
not
stated
a
cause
of
action
on
which
he
can
recover.
he
has
not
spoken
once
in
the
area
of
whether
there
has
been
a
breach
of
any
implied
warranty
by
the
shipowner.
we
claim
he
is
alleging
merely
tortuous
conduct.and
--
mr.
paul
mccambridge
yes
sir.
mr.
paul
mccambridge
he
is
entitled
to
subrogation
through
his
employee,
in
his
employee's
cause
of
action
against
us.
but
i
say
--
my
position
is
sir
that
he
does
not
have
an
independent
cause
of
action
other
than
that
given
by
the
--
other
than
given
by
the
compensation
act.
under
the
act
he
is
subrogated
to
his
employee's
recovery.
mr.
paul
mccambridge
i
am
--
mr.
paul
mccambridge
we
admit
that
we
may
be
liable
--
mr.
paul
mccambridge
--for
as
much
as
$30,000.00,
yes
sir.
mr.
paul
mccambridge
i
say
he
has
no
cause
of
action
against
us.
mr.
paul
mccambridge
because
his
--
mr.
paul
mccambridge
his
employee
has
already
brought
a
cause
of
action.
there
was
a
parallel
case,
two
cases
will
be
tried
by
the
district
court.
one
is
the
widow's
action
against
us
for
--
under
the
wrongful
death
action
for
$30,000.00.
now,
he
--
the
longshoreman
--
i'm
sorry
the
stevedore
company
or
its
insurance
company
will
be
entitled
to
--
to
be
reimbursed
from
the
--
whatever
the
widow's
recovery
is
against
us,
up
to
the
amount
of
the
compensation
payments
they
have
made.
now
if
she
--
mr.
paul
mccambridge
yes
sir.
this
of
course
is
the
puzzling
thing
if
the
--
to
me
anyway
if
the
stevedore
felt
that
it
had
a
--
an
independent
cause
of
action
not
against
the
--
not
under
the
compensation
act,
why
didn't
it
bring
it
direct
against
us
rather
than
after
the
widow's
action
had
been
brought
and
then
we
had
to
go
back
and
sue
the
--
bring
our
action
for
indemnity
--
mr.
paul
mccambridge
it
has
not
--
has
yet
been
paid
your
honor.
the
--
mr.
paul
mccambridge
well,
they
say
they
can
sue
us
directly.we
say,
no
you
cannot.
mr.
paul
mccambridge
they
can
get
it
through
their
employee's
recovery
against
us.
the
only
way
that
they
can
get
it
is
by
virtue
of
their
employee's
recovery
against
the
--
mr.
paul
mccambridge
because
this
is
the
manner
in
which
the
act
says
it
will
be
recovered.
what
--
mr.
paul
mccambridge
yes
sir.
mr.
paul
mccambridge
no,
as
a
--
they
--
as
a
matter
of
law,
they
have
a
lien
against
his
recovery.
we
cannot
--
we
--
as
i
--
representing
a
shipowner,
i
cannot
effectively
enter
into
a
settlement
compromise
without
the
approval
of
the
--
of
the
in
--
the
compensation
carrier
because
if
i
do
--
as
in
this
instance.
mr.
paul
mccambridge
i
may
owe
him
but
it
also
would
cut
off
the
employee's
right
to
any
deficiency
if
we
settle
the
claim
with
the
compensation
carrier
without
their
written
approval
of
the
settlement.
mr.
paul
mccambridge
oh,
no
sir.
because
it
had
--
there
isn't
--
there's
a
separate
action
in
which
the
widow
is
bringing
--
has
brought
her
cause
and
--
mr.
paul
mccambridge
no
sir.
mr.
paul
mccambridge
oh,
i
--
no,
we
will
pay
the
widow
off
but
--
mr.
paul
mccambridge
well,
i
--
no,
i
don't
know
what
the
employer
would
be
entitled
to
receive
from
the
check
that
we
pay
her,
whatever
compensation
it
has
already
paid.
now,
for
example
--
mr.
paul
mccambridge
then
they
would
get
the
whole
$30,000.00
in
--
mr.
paul
mccambridge
they
are
in
the
lawsuit
right
now.
they
are
the
employer.
mr.
paul
mccambridge
i
think
the
effect
of
that
would
--
said
what
is
that
it
would
it
be,
yes
sir.
mr.
paul
mccambridge
well
--
mr.
paul
mccambridge
well,
that's
my
fault
sir,
then
it's
not
yours
because
my
job
is
to
make
it
understandable.
mr.
paul
mccambridge
our
--
mr.
paul
mccambridge
yes
sir.
mr.
paul
mccambridge
yes
sir.
mr.
paul
mccambridge
that
is
correct
sir.
now,
if
you
want
to
look
behind
the
scenes
in
this
case
and
i
don't
think
it
really
affects
--
mr.
paul
mccambridge
--
what
he
has
done.
the
steve
--
the
insurance
company
is
actually
--
has
brought
the
suit
in
the
widow's
name.
and
the
insurance
suing
as
mrs.
mcneill
has
sued
the
shipowner.
mr.
paul
mccambridge
oh
it
is,
i
mean
--
mr.
paul
mccambridge
yes
sir.
mr.
paul
mccambridge
no,
stevedore
--
mr.
paul
mccambridge
the
stevedoring
company
can
have
a
potential
liability
of
$70,000.00
if
the
widow
doesn't
remarry
until
the
children
are
--
reached
the
age
of
18.
mr.
paul
mccambridge
the
illinois
wrongful
death
action
would
limit
the
subrogated
right
to
$30,000.00,
yes
sir.
mr.
paul
mccambridge
i
don't
think
there's
too
much
question
--
mr.
paul
mccambridge
in
this
area
of
the
law?
mr.
paul
mccambridge
oh,
this
is
--
was
not
a
question
before
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
paul
mccambridge
the
question
merely
went
to
whether
the
counterclaim
for
indemnity
for
all
the
cause
that
the
stevedore
might
have
to
pay
its
--
in
compensation
to
recover
its
attorney's
fees
for
suing
us.
the
only
thing
that
was
before
the
court
of
appeals
was
whether
it
stated
a
cause
of
action.
mr.
paul
mccambridge
yes
sir.
mr.
paul
mccambridge
absent
in
expressed
agreement
between
the
parties.
i
would
have
to
make
that
very
clear
that
this
of
course,
the
parties
are
free
to
contract
but
that
--
the
court
of
appeals
from
the
seventh
circuit
held
that
by
virtue
of
the
relationship
between
the
parties,
there
was
not
necessarily
implied
any
warranty
running
from
the
shipowner
to
the
stevedore.
and
the
court
of
appeals
correctly
reasoned
that
absent
such
an
expressed
agreement
that
the
stevedore's
exclusive
means
of
recovering
its
compensation
was
by
the
vehicle
of
the
action
under
the
longshoremen's
and
harbor
workers'
compensation
act.
mr.
paul
mccambridge
oh,
i
--
whether
they
state
it
in
so
many
words,
i
think
that's
that
--
mr.
paul
mccambridge
that
--
that
is
the
claim,
yes
sir.
mr.
paul
mccambridge
an
implied
warranty
--
mr.
paul
mccambridge
because
this
court
held
in
ryan
that
the
stevedore's
obligation
to
safely
perform
was
truly
of
the
essence
of
the
stevedoring
contract.
it
was
performing
services
to
the
vessel
and
it
essent
--
it
--
the
essence
of
the
contract
was,
we
will
safely
perform
this
and
the
court
compared
that
--
mr.
paul
mccambridge
i
read
your
dissent
in
the
ryan
case
sir
and
i
can
understand
that
the
--
that
you
know,
that
this
would
be
a
reasonable
approach
to
the
question
--
mr.
paul
mccambridge
i
--
that
is
one
answer
mr.
justice
white.
i
don't
think
it
necessarily
would
prevent
it
if
it
were
expressly
agreed
upon
but
the
duties
that
--
which
the
stevedore
urges
that
we
owed
to
them
as
a
matter
of
contract
are
tort
duties,
the
duty
to
use
ordinary
care,
the
duty
to
warn
of
hidden
defects.
these
are
tort
duties.
mr.
paul
mccambridge
they
are
duties,
we
would
--
i
would
acknowledge
that
these
are
duties
we
owed
them
to
everyone
who
is
aboard
the
ship
but
they
do
not
arise
necessarily
by
virtue
of
the
stevedoring
contract
whereas
this
court
has
expressed
--
mr.
paul
mccambridge
well,
two
district
court
decisions
in
california
which
interpreted
the
hugev
which
is
relied
upon
by
my
opponent
said
it
isn't
just
a
matter
of
semantics.
it
really
is
the
true
perspective
of
the
reasoning
is
that
these
duties
existed
independent
of
contract
and
that
they
do
not
arise
by
virtue
of
the
contract.
and
in
this
area
--
mr.
paul
mccambridge
i
--
no
sir,
but
this
--
i
think
this
really
goes
to
the
real
crux
of
why
this
case
possibly
could
be
important.
mr.
paul
mccambridge
and
if
i
may
have
just
a
moment,
i
--
mr.
paul
mccambridge
if
the
shipowner
does
in
fact
impliedly
warrant
that
it
will
observe
a
tort
obligation
to
use
ordinary
care
or
to
warn
of
hidden
defects
or
if
it
owes
the
duty
to
furnish
a
safe
place
to
work
not
only
to
the
individual
longshoreman
which
sieracki
says
it
owes.
but
it
also
owes
that
same
to
the
stevedore
employer
to
furnish
its
employee's
a
safe
place
to
work.
the
whole
balance
in
this
area
of
indemnification
between
shipowners
and
stevedores
will
be
thrown
out
of
balance
because
in
every
case,
the
fact
that
a
shipowner
has
failed
to
furnish
a
safe
place
to
work
and
that
is
this
liability
would
have
to
fall.
it's
the
absolute
non-delegable
liability
duty
that
it
has
in
every
case
that
would
prevent
its
recovery
of
indemnity
against
a
stevedore
because
it
would
be
a
breach
contract.
it
would
be
a
breach
of
warranty
that
it
would
furnish
a
safe
place
to
work.
now,
the
cases
have
never
held
--
in
fact
the
cases
are
in
accord
that
the
shipowner
does
not
furnish
--
does
not
warrant
to
a
stevedore
that
it
will
furnish
a
seaworthy
vessel.
a
seaworthy
vessel,
the
duty
to
furnish
a
seaworthy
vessel
and
the
duty
to
provide
a
safe
place
for
a
longshoreman
to
work
is
identical,
it's
the
identical
obligation
really.
and
it
--
and
the
injured
longshoreman
recover
in
these
cases
because
the
shipowner
has
breached
this
duty
to
furnish
a
safe
place
to
work.
now
--
mr.
paul
mccambridge
in
that
case,
i
would
say
that
the
injured
or
decedent
--
the
deceased
could
recover
from
the
shipowner
and
the
shipowner
would
be
prevented
from
recovery
of
indemnity
from
the
stevedore
because
obviously
the
ship's
gangway
is
something
that
is
furnished
by
the
shipowner.
therefore
in
the
first
instance,
the
longshoremen
recover.
the
second
aspect
of
that
question
would
be
that
in
the
first
time
up
a
gangway,
the
stevedore
does
not
necessarily
have
a
duty
to
inspect.
this
is
something
that
is
--
this
was
in
the
--
that
is
within
the
realm
of
the
shipowner's
responsibility.
therefore
in
this
case,
the
furnishing
of
the
defect
of
the
gangway
would
prevent
the
stevedore
--
mr.
paul
mccambridge
those
are
--
these
are
not
the
decisions
of
this
court.
this
--
the
decisions
--
mr.
paul
mccambridge
i
think
i
might
--
mr.
paul
mccambridge
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
paul
mccambridge
i
know,
i'm
satisfied
if
the
court
has
heard
me
completely.
thank
you.
mr.
paul
mccambridge
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
first
direct
my
answer
to
mr.
justice
harlan's
inquiry
about
whether
the
vessel
was
in
time
charter
or
whether
the
owner
was
had
entered
into
some
contractual
relationship
with
the
stevedore.
the
answer
is
in
the
record.
there
was
an
allegation
in
the
liability
that
the
--
it's
on
--
it's
on
page
5
of
the
appendix
and
it's
paragraph
7
of
the
liable
in
which
we
alleged
that
the
work
of
the
respondent
was
being
performed
pursuant
to
agreement
between
the
respondent
and
the
time
charter
the
vessel,
federal
commerce
and
navigation
company
limited,
a
corporation
affiliated
with
the
respondent.
and
then
on
page
9
of
appendix
that
allegation
in
the
liable
is
admitted
so
i
don't
--
there's
too
much
question
that
the
vessel
was
under
time
charter
and
certainly
that
leads
us
right
into
--
immediately
one
of
the
principal
contentions
that
we
make
to
this
court.
and
that
which
that
there
is
no
affirmative
contract
between
the
stevedore
and
the
petitioner
or
--
i'm
sorry,
the
stevedore
and
the
shipowner
and
that
therefore
there
--
absent
a
contractual
relationship
certainly
there
cannot
be
any
implied
duties
running
from
the
shipowner
to
the
stevedore.
mr.
paul
mccambridge
i
--
yes
sir.
the
--
mr.
paul
mccambridge
yes
sir.
i
think
this
--
that
has
been
decided
--
mr.
paul
mccambridge
yes
sir
that
was
decided
by
this
court
that
the
shipowner
was
a
beneficiary
of
the
contract
between
the
stevedore
and
the
time
charterer,
i
think
it
was
reed
versus
yaka.
mr.
paul
mccambridge
well,
i
think
this
is
one
of
my
opponent's
principle,
the
things
that
really
trouble
him
under
the
--
he
feels
that
he
doesn't
have
an
equal
--
in
equal
side
of
shipowner
that
he
is
into
some
more
stringent
obligation
to
the
ship
rather
than
the
shipowner
is
to
the
stevedore.
the
petitioner's
counterclaim
upon
which
it
basis
its
claim
to
indemnity
is
based
upon
allegations
--
that
the
shipowner
was
negligent
and
the
shipowner
breached
a
duty
old
to
the
stevedore
that
it
furnish
its
longshoremen
employees
a
safe
place
to
work
onboard
the
vessel.
mr.
paul
mccambridge
that's
--
that
is
correct.
the
--
mr.
justice,
the
court
agreed
with
us
that
the
--
complaint
or
the
counterclaim
was
defective
as
a
matter
of
law
because
essentially
--
mr.
paul
mccambridge
--
stated
a
tortuous
claim
of
action
rather
than
one
under
contract.
mr.
paul
mccambridge
the
--
mr.
paul
mccambridge
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
mr.
paul
mccambridge
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
paul
mccambridge
that
--
mr.
paul
mccambridge
you
know
that's
correct
mr.
justice.
mr.
paul
mccambridge
this
is
a
question
that
is
not
really
before
this
court.
this
--
this
could
arise
and
it
will
arise
i
think
with
the
efforts
being
made
by
shipowners
to
contractually
--
i'm
sorry,
not
shipowners,
by
stevedores
to
contractually
work
their
way
out
of
the
predicament,
they
are
in
where
they
find
themselves
on
may
times
responding
for
what
they
consider
is
the
ship's
liability
in
this
area
of
the
law
where
the
shipowner
has
his
right
to
indemnity
against
the
stevedore
for
a
breach
of
its
worthy
of
safe
performance
in
the
service
of
a
vessel.
mr.
paul
mccambridge
no
sir,
no
sir,
this
is
ancillary
to
the
argument.
mr.
paul
mccambridge
that
is
correct.
that
is
one
--
that
is
--
mr.
paul
mccambridge
no
sir.
doesn't
matter
to
me.
the
judgment
were
deferred.
we
maintain
that
in
this
field
of
indemnity
in
longshoreman
personal
injury
cases,
indemnity
as
between
a
shipowner
and
a
stevedore
can
be
predicated
only
upon
a
contract
theory
of
warranty.
now
the
stevedores
counterclaim
in
--
for
indemnity
is
premised
entirely
upon
what
we
considered
to
be
tortuous
conduct
of
the
shipowner
which
we
say
is
not
--
they
are
duties
that
arise
by
virtue
of
any
contractual
relationships.
these
are
duties
which
exist
irrespective
of
any
contractual
relationship
between
the
shipowner
and
a
stevedore.
the
petitioner's
counterclaim
essentially
has
been
changed.
the
--
mr.
hough
has
mentioned
to
the
court
now
that
he
is
--
looking
only
for
a
reasonably
safe
place
for
his
stevedore
employees
to
work.
however
the
counterclaim
itself
specifically
says
it
is
based
upon
a
purported
duty
owed
by
the
shipowner
to
the
stevedore
to
furnish
a
safe
place
to
work.
now,
this
duty
to
furnish
a
safe
place
to
work
is
clearly
a
duty
owed
to
the
individual
longshoreman
working
onboard
the
boat
--
onboard
the
ship.
it's
the
--
if
the
species
of
liability
that
was
enunciated
without
thought.
it
was
enunciated
by
this
court
in
sieracki.
mr.
paul
mccambridge
i
would
say
--
mr.
paul
mccambridge
this
would
depend
upon
--
on
the
contract,
i
think
between
the
shipowner
and
the
stevedore
and
this
--
mr.
paul
mccambridge
well,
i
don't
think
in
this
particular
case.
i
thought
your
honor
or
the
court
was
referring
to
a
general
obligation.
no,
i
think
damage
--
mr.
paul
mccambridge
oh.
mr.
paul
mccambridge
there
--
there's
--
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
but
that
a
--
mr.
paul
mccambridge
because
this
is
a
duty
generally
owed
to
everyone.
this
duty
to
exercise
ordinary
care
which
is
spoken
of
by
the
petitioner
and
the
duty
to
warn
of
a
hidden
defect,
these
are
tort
obligations
and
this
court
in
ryan
admonished
that
in
ascertaining
a
shipowner's
liabilities
and
his
responsibilities
that
resort
may
not
be
had
to
principals
of
quasi
contract
or
to
principles
of
tort
liability.
mr.
justice
white,
you
addressed
yourself
to
the
question
what
duties
are
owed
to
and
when
it
comes
aboard
a
ship.
and
i
think
it
was
--
but
that
question
was
put
to
rest
in
the
kermarec
that
the
shipowner
owes
the
duties
to
use
ordinary
care
and
to
warn
of
hidden
defects.
he
owes
these
to
all
persons
who
are
lawfully
aboard
his
vessel.
therefore,
it
is
clear
i
believe,
it's
obvious
that
is
are
not
duties
arising
by
virtue
of
contract
but
that
they
are
independently
owed
duties
and
they're
tort
duties.
now
the
shipowner
of
the
--
pardon
me,
the
stevedore
has
brought
his
counterclaim
alleging
that
he
has
a
independent
cause
of
action
against
this
--
against
the
shipowner
under
contract
and
separate
from
the
action
which
is
given
him
under
the
longshoremen's
and
harbor
workers'
compensation
act.
he
says
that
section
33
of
that
act
provides
a
statutory
method
by
which
an
employer
may
be
reimbursed
for
the
compensation
expenditures
that
must
pay
for
--
to
its
injured
employees
but
he
says
because
the
act
is
not
specifically
barring
independent
cause
of
action
therefore
it
should
not
preclude
this
action.
we
feel
that
that
argument
is
false
or
at
least
the
fallacy
can
be
demonstrated
by
the
fact
that
prior
to
the
enactment
of
compensation
statutes
generally
in
this
statute
in
particular,
an
employer
no
--
had
no
non-negligent
liability
for
injuries
to
its
employees.
therefore
we
feel
that
proper
construction
of
the
statute
says
that
if
the
liability
standards
from
the
statutes
certainly,
then
the
corresponding
right
to
be
reimbursed
must
also
be
predicated
upon
that
statute.
the
--
and
i
feel
that
the
petitioner's
principal
complaint
here
is
that
he
doesn't
have
a
complete
remedy
under
the
longshoreman's
act
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
if
he
takes
under
that
act
is
the
assignee
or
the
subrogee
of
the
employee's
claim
then
he
will
be
limited
to
the
$30,000.00
maximum
recovery
which
was
permitted
under
illinois
law
in
effect
to
the
time
of
this
accident.
however,
it
is
maintained
that
the
employers
are
as
carriers,
insurance
carriers
potential
liability
is
$70,000.00
therefore
he
is
going
to
be
at
least
$40,000.00
out
of
pocket
rate
--
right
away
if
he
cannot
find
a
way
to
get
around
the
longshoremen's
and
harbor
workers'
compensation
act.
i
believe
that
this
question,
this
possibility
or
likelihood
that
there
would
be
cases
in
which
the
injured
employee
in
bringing
his
cause
of
action
against
a
negligent
third
party,
there
were
cases
in
which
he
would
recover
less
from
the
negligent
third
party
than
he
might
against
--
as
a
right
--
result
of
his
entitlement
to
compensation
benefits.
the
congress
covered
this
in
subsection
(f)
of
section
33.
it
isn't
in
the
appendix
but
it
is
in
the
petitioner's
brief
on
page
3
of
petitioner's
brief.
in
contemplating
what
would
occur
when
there
was
a
deficiency
in
the
employees
recovery,
the
congress
did
not
say
or
did
not
enact
that
the
employer
or
his
compensation
carrier
might
have
a
separate
cause
of
action
or
additional
cause
of
action
against
the
negligent
third
party
to
recover
the
deposit
that
it
might
have
from
its
right
to
be
reimbursed
from
--
or
to
recover
from
the
employees
recovery
but
instead
in
protecting
the
employee
it
said
that
the
employer
shall
pay
to
the
employee
any
deficiency
between
whatever
it
recovers
from
the
negligent
third
party
and
what
it
was
entitled
to
under
the
compensation
act.
the
act,
i
think
it's
designed
to
protect
employees
rather
than
employers
to
some
extent
anyway.
we
feel
that
the
congress
in
enacting
this
statute
specified
--
set
forth
a
particular
manner
in
which
reimbursement
could
be
achieved
by
the
employer
and
we
feel
that
the
mode
of
reimbursement
under
the
statute
is
very,
very
plain.
the
compensation
statutes
have
been
consistently
interpreted
to
cover
the
entire
area
of
industrial
injuries
and
basically
where
congress
has
provided
a
means
of
recovery,
i
don't
think
it's
necessary
to
go
outside
the
act.
i
think
the
recovery
must
be
found
within
the
four
corners
of
the
act.
we
certainly
we
feel
that
congress
did
not
intend
that
there
should
be
two
recoveries
for
a
single
tort.
the
second
aspect
of
this
question
is
before
the
court
is
how
can
the
--
or
what
rules
do
govern
this
area
of
indemnity?
i
think
it's
clear
from
the
decisions
of
this
court
beginning
with
ryan
going
under
weyerhaeuser,
crumady
that
indemnity
in
these
cases
must
be
predicated
entirely
upon
contractual
warranty.
mr.
paul
mccambridge
oh,
it
could
be
implied
or
expressed.
we
wouldn't
have
a
problem
where
it's
expressed
--
mr.
paul
mccambridge
yes
sir,
implied
warranty.
and
yet
there
--
mr.
paul
mccambridge
because
it
is
narrowly
a
contractual
duty
owed
to
the
--
mr.
paul
mccambridge
i'm
sorry,
maybe
i'm
misunderstood.
mr.
paul
mccambridge
yes
sir.
mr.
paul
mccambridge
yes
sir.
mr.
paul
mccambridge
the
shipowner
would
pay
the
judgment
and
following
--
mr.
paul
mccambridge
--
ryan
he
would
bring
his
indemnity
action
against
the
stevedore
employer
for
alleging
any
way
a
breach
of
the
stevedores
warranty
of
safe
performance.
mr.
paul
mccambridge
the
courts
in
following
this
court's
several
decisions
in
this
area
of
the
law
have
examined
the
shipowner's
conduct
in
the
context
of
whether
it
--
its
conduct
has
actively
hindered
or
whether
it
has
prevented
the
stevedore
from
safely
performing
its
services
to
the
vessel.
if
the
shipowner's
conduct
has
been
of
that
nature,
then
the
courts
merely
say
you
have
no
right
to
indemnity
for
the
amounts
that
you
have
paid
to
the
injured
employee.
you
cannot
recover
this
from
his
employer.
but
the
courts
have
not
gone
further.
they
have
not
created
the
--
you
might
say
the
reverse
warranty
or
the
reverse
obligation
that
the
--
there
might
be
an
affirmative
recovery
by
the
stevedore
against
the
shipowner
on
that
case.
mr.
paul
mccambridge
she
is
being
paid
compensation
benefits,
yes
sir.
mr.
paul
mccambridge
yes
sir.
mr.
paul
mccambridge
yes
sir.
mr.
paul
mccambridge
that
is
what
the
case
is
about,
yes
sir.
mr.
paul
mccambridge
they
amended
the
provision
in
section
33
required
an
automatic
assignment
of
employees'
cause
of
action
against
the
third
party
to
the
employer.
there's
an
automatic
assignment
under
the
old
act
--
mr.
paul
mccambridge
to
his
employer
or
--
mr.
paul
mccambridge
and
--
mr.
paul
mccambridge
his
cause
of
action
against
a
negligent
third
party.
mr.
paul
mccambridge
yes
sir.
mr.
paul
mccambridge
they
can
recover
on
that
assignment
as
a
matter
subrogation
mr.
justice
black
however
they
take
it
as
an
assigned
cause
of
action,
they
--
therefore
stand
in
the
employee's
stead
in
bringing
that
suit.
the
employee
is
limited
to
the
maximum
recovery
of
$30,000.00
which
was
in
effect,
under
the
illinois
wrongful
death
action
at
that
time.
mr.
paul
mccambridge
yes
sir.
mr.
paul
mccambridge
yes
sir.
mr.
paul
mccambridge
this
is
a
potential
liability
which
they
alleged.
yes
sir.
mr.
paul
mccambridge
yes
sir
and
in
the
--
mr.
paul
mccambridge
not
as
such.
this
--
following
this
court's
decisions,
i
think
in
the
late
1950's,
the
--
mr.
paul
mccambridge
this
--
can
borrow
the
concept
of
unseaworthiness.
mr.
paul
mccambridge
yes
sir.
mr.
paul
mccambridge
oh,
yes
sir.
that
is
their
--
that's
what
--
mr.
paul
mccambridge
i
cannot
speak
for
mr.
hough
but
what
he
wants
to
do
is
avoid
the
impact
of
the
compensation
act.
he
wants
to
say
regardless
of
whether
there's
a
compensation
act
or
not.
i
have
a
separate
cause
of
action
against
the
shipowner
because
the
shipowner
has
been
negligent.
mr.
paul
mccambridge
yes
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
paul
mccambridge
no,
not
for
the
death
of
the
man
--
mr.
paul
mccambridge
that
he
claims
that
he
has
been
damaged
in
the
amount
of
a
potential
liability
of
$70,000.00
which
represents
the
total
amount
of
compensation
benefits
which
may
have
to
be
paid
to
the
decedent's
widow
and
to
his
dependent
children.
mr.
paul
mccambridge
the
--
mr.
paul
mccambridge
the
man
is
limited
in
--
to
$30,000.00
in
his
recovery
against
me,
the
negligent
shipowner,
however,
under
the
act
there
is
no
maximum
limitation
then
--
mr.
paul
mccambridge
that
is
correct
sir.
there
is
no
--
an
action
--
mr.
paul
mccambridge
that
is
correct.
mr.
paul
mccambridge
i
think
that
is
an
aspect
of
the
case
mr.
justice
fortas.
the
--
mr.
paul
mccambridge
yes
sir.
we
--
we
say
that
the
petitioner,
stevedore
has
not
stated
a
cause
of
action
on
which
he
can
recover.
he
has
not
spoken
once
in
the
area
of
whether
there
has
been
a
breach
of
any
implied
warranty
by
the
shipowner.
we
claim
he
is
alleging
merely
tortuous
conduct.and
--
mr.
paul
mccambridge
yes
sir.
mr.
paul
mccambridge
he
is
entitled
to
subrogation
through
his
employee,
in
his
employee's
cause
of
action
against
us.
but
i
say
--
my
position
is
sir
that
he
does
not
have
an
independent
cause
of
action
other
than
that
given
by
the
--
other
than
given
by
the
compensation
act.
under
the
act
he
is
subrogated
to
his
employee's
recovery.
mr.
paul
mccambridge
i
am
--
mr.
paul
mccambridge
we
admit
that
we
may
be
liable
--
mr.
paul
mccambridge
--for
as
much
as
$30,000.00,
yes
sir.
mr.
paul
mccambridge
i
say
he
has
no
cause
of
action
against
us.
mr.
paul
mccambridge
because
his
--
mr.
paul
mccambridge
his
employee
has
already
brought
a
cause
of
action.
there
was
a
parallel
case,
two
cases
will
be
tried
by
the
district
court.
one
is
the
widow's
action
against
us
for
--
under
the
wrongful
death
action
for
$30,000.00.
now,
he
--
the
longshoreman
--
i'm
sorry
the
stevedore
company
or
its
insurance
company
will
be
entitled
to
--
to
be
reimbursed
from
the
--
whatever
the
widow's
recovery
is
against
us,
up
to
the
amount
of
the
compensation
payments
they
have
made.
now
if
she
--
mr.
paul
mccambridge
yes
sir.
this
of
course
is
the
puzzling
thing
if
the
--
to
me
anyway
if
the
stevedore
felt
that
it
had
a
--
an
independent
cause
of
action
not
against
the
--
not
under
the
compensation
act,
why
didn't
it
bring
it
direct
against
us
rather
than
after
the
widow's
action
had
been
brought
and
then
we
had
to
go
back
and
sue
the
--
bring
our
action
for
indemnity
--
mr.
paul
mccambridge
it
has
not
--
has
yet
been
paid
your
honor.
the
--
mr.
paul
mccambridge
well,
they
say
they
can
sue
us
directly.we
say,
no
you
cannot.
mr.
paul
mccambridge
they
can
get
it
through
their
employee's
recovery
against
us.
the
only
way
that
they
can
get
it
is
by
virtue
of
their
employee's
recovery
against
the
--
mr.
paul
mccambridge
because
this
is
the
manner
in
which
the
act
says
it
will
be
recovered.
what
--
mr.
paul
mccambridge
yes
sir.
mr.
paul
mccambridge
no,
as
a
--
they
--
as
a
matter
of
law,
they
have
a
lien
against
his
recovery.
we
cannot
--
we
--
as
i
--
representing
a
shipowner,
i
cannot
effectively
enter
into
a
settlement
compromise
without
the
approval
of
the
--
of
the
in
--
the
compensation
carrier
because
if
i
do
--
as
in
this
instance.
mr.
paul
mccambridge
i
may
owe
him
but
it
also
would
cut
off
the
employee's
right
to
any
deficiency
if
we
settle
the
claim
with
the
compensation
carrier
without
their
written
approval
of
the
settlement.
mr.
paul
mccambridge
oh,
no
sir.
because
it
had
--
there
isn't
--
there's
a
separate
action
in
which
the
widow
is
bringing
--
has
brought
her
cause
and
--
mr.
paul
mccambridge
no
sir.
mr.
paul
mccambridge
oh,
i
--
no,
we
will
pay
the
widow
off
but
--
mr.
paul
mccambridge
well,
i
--
no,
i
don't
know
what
the
employer
would
be
entitled
to
receive
from
the
check
that
we
pay
her,
whatever
compensation
it
has
already
paid.
now,
for
example
--
mr.
paul
mccambridge
then
they
would
get
the
whole
$30,000.00
in
--
mr.
paul
mccambridge
they
are
in
the
lawsuit
right
now.
they
are
the
employer.
mr.
paul
mccambridge
i
think
the
effect
of
that
would
--
said
what
is
that
it
would
it
be,
yes
sir.
mr.
paul
mccambridge
well
--
mr.
paul
mccambridge
well,
that's
my
fault
sir,
then
it's
not
yours
because
my
job
is
to
make
it
understandable.
mr.
paul
mccambridge
our
--
mr.
paul
mccambridge
yes
sir.
mr.
paul
mccambridge
yes
sir.
mr.
paul
mccambridge
that
is
correct
sir.
now,
if
you
want
to
look
behind
the
scenes
in
this
case
and
i
don't
think
it
really
affects
--
mr.
paul
mccambridge
--
what
he
has
done.
the
steve
--
the
insurance
company
is
actually
--
has
brought
the
suit
in
the
widow's
name.
and
the
insurance
suing
as
mrs.
mcneill
has
sued
the
shipowner.
mr.
paul
mccambridge
oh
it
is,
i
mean
--
mr.
paul
mccambridge
yes
sir.
mr.
paul
mccambridge
no,
stevedore
--
mr.
paul
mccambridge
the
stevedoring
company
can
have
a
potential
liability
of
$70,000.00
if
the
widow
doesn't
remarry
until
the
children
are
--
reached
the
age
of
18.
mr.
paul
mccambridge
the
illinois
wrongful
death
action
would
limit
the
subrogated
right
to
$30,000.00,
yes
sir.
mr.
paul
mccambridge
i
don't
think
there's
too
much
question
--
mr.
paul
mccambridge
in
this
area
of
the
law?
mr.
paul
mccambridge
oh,
this
is
--
was
not
a
question
before
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
paul
mccambridge
the
question
merely
went
to
whether
the
counterclaim
for
indemnity
for
all
the
cause
that
the
stevedore
might
have
to
pay
its
--
in
compensation
to
recover
its
attorney's
fees
for
suing
us.
the
only
thing
that
was
before
the
court
of
appeals
was
whether
it
stated
a
cause
of
action.
mr.
paul
mccambridge
yes
sir.
mr.
paul
mccambridge
absent
in
expressed
agreement
between
the
parties.
i
would
have
to
make
that
very
clear
that
this
of
course,
the
parties
are
free
to
contract
but
that
--
the
court
of
appeals
from
the
seventh
circuit
held
that
by
virtue
of
the
relationship
between
the
parties,
there
was
not
necessarily
implied
any
warranty
running
from
the
shipowner
to
the
stevedore.
and
the
court
of
appeals
correctly
reasoned
that
absent
such
an
expressed
agreement
that
the
stevedore's
exclusive
means
of
recovering
its
compensation
was
by
the
vehicle
of
the
action
under
the
longshoremen's
and
harbor
workers'
compensation
act.
mr.
paul
mccambridge
oh,
i
--
whether
they
state
it
in
so
many
words,
i
think
that's
that
--
mr.
paul
mccambridge
that
--
that
is
the
claim,
yes
sir.
mr.
paul
mccambridge
an
implied
warranty
--
mr.
paul
mccambridge
because
this
court
held
in
ryan
that
the
stevedore's
obligation
to
safely
perform
was
truly
of
the
essence
of
the
stevedoring
contract.
it
was
performing
services
to
the
vessel
and
it
essent
--
it
--
the
essence
of
the
contract
was,
we
will
safely
perform
this
and
the
court
compared
that
--
mr.
paul
mccambridge
i
read
your
dissent
in
the
ryan
case
sir
and
i
can
understand
that
the
--
that
you
know,
that
this
would
be
a
reasonable
approach
to
the
question
--
mr.
paul
mccambridge
i
--
that
is
one
answer
mr.
justice
white.
i
don't
think
it
necessarily
would
prevent
it
if
it
were
expressly
agreed
upon
but
the
duties
that
--
which
the
stevedore
urges
that
we
owed
to
them
as
a
matter
of
contract
are
tort
duties,
the
duty
to
use
ordinary
care,
the
duty
to
warn
of
hidden
defects.
these
are
tort
duties.
mr.
paul
mccambridge
they
are
duties,
we
would
--
i
would
acknowledge
that
these
are
duties
we
owed
them
to
everyone
who
is
aboard
the
ship
but
they
do
not
arise
necessarily
by
virtue
of
the
stevedoring
contract
whereas
this
court
has
expressed
--
mr.
paul
mccambridge
well,
two
district
court
decisions
in
california
which
interpreted
the
hugev
which
is
relied
upon
by
my
opponent
said
it
isn't
just
a
matter
of
semantics.
it
really
is
the
true
perspective
of
the
reasoning
is
that
these
duties
existed
independent
of
contract
and
that
they
do
not
arise
by
virtue
of
the
contract.
and
in
this
area
--
mr.
paul
mccambridge
i
--
no
sir,
but
this
--
i
think
this
really
goes
to
the
real
crux
of
why
this
case
possibly
could
be
important.
mr.
paul
mccambridge
and
if
i
may
have
just
a
moment,
i
--
mr.
paul
mccambridge
if
the
shipowner
does
in
fact
impliedly
warrant
that
it
will
observe
a
tort
obligation
to
use
ordinary
care
or
to
warn
of
hidden
defects
or
if
it
owes
the
duty
to
furnish
a
safe
place
to
work
not
only
to
the
individual
longshoreman
which
sieracki
says
it
owes.
but
it
also
owes
that
same
to
the
stevedore
employer
to
furnish
its
employee's
a
safe
place
to
work.
the
whole
balance
in
this
area
of
indemnification
between
shipowners
and
stevedores
will
be
thrown
out
of
balance
because
in
every
case,
the
fact
that
a
shipowner
has
failed
to
furnish
a
safe
place
to
work
and
that
is
this
liability
would
have
to
fall.
it's
the
absolute
non-delegable
liability
duty
that
it
has
in
every
case
that
would
prevent
its
recovery
of
indemnity
against
a
stevedore
because
it
would
be
a
breach
contract.
it
would
be
a
breach
of
warranty
that
it
would
furnish
a
safe
place
to
work.
now,
the
cases
have
never
held
--
in
fact
the
cases
are
in
accord
that
the
shipowner
does
not
furnish
--
does
not
warrant
to
a
stevedore
that
it
will
furnish
a
seaworthy
vessel.
a
seaworthy
vessel,
the
duty
to
furnish
a
seaworthy
vessel
and
the
duty
to
provide
a
safe
place
for
a
longshoreman
to
work
is
identical,
it's
the
identical
obligation
really.
and
it
--
and
the
injured
longshoreman
recover
in
these
cases
because
the
shipowner
has
breached
this
duty
to
furnish
a
safe
place
to
work.
now
--
mr.
paul
mccambridge
in
that
case,
i
would
say
that
the
injured
or
decedent
--
the
deceased
could
recover
from
the
shipowner
and
the
shipowner
would
be
prevented
from
recovery
of
indemnity
from
the
stevedore
because
obviously
the
ship's
gangway
is
something
that
is
furnished
by
the
shipowner.
therefore
in
the
first
instance,
the
longshoremen
recover.
the
second
aspect
of
that
question
would
be
that
in
the
first
time
up
a
gangway,
the
stevedore
does
not
necessarily
have
a
duty
to
inspect.
this
is
something
that
is
--
this
was
in
the
--
that
is
within
the
realm
of
the
shipowner's
responsibility.
therefore
in
this
case,
the
furnishing
of
the
defect
of
the
gangway
would
prevent
the
stevedore
--
mr.
paul
mccambridge
those
are
--
these
are
not
the
decisions
of
this
court.
this
--
the
decisions
--
mr.
paul
mccambridge
i
think
i
might
--
mr.
paul
mccambridge
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
paul
mccambridge
i
know,
i'm
satisfied
if
the
court
has
heard
me
completely.
thank
you.
