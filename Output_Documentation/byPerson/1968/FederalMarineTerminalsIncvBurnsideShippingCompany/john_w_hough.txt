mr.
john
w.
hough
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
one
gordon
mcneill,
stevedore
employee
of
the
petitioner,
federal
marine
terminals
inc.
fell
into
the
number
3
deep
tank
of
the
vessel
otterburn
owned
by
the
respondent
on
june
2,
1965
and
was
killed.
thereafter,
his
widow
filed
a
wrongful
death
action
against
the
vessel
owners.
in
a
separate
action
the
vessel
owners,
burnside
shipping
company,
the
respondent
filed
an
action
under
the
ryan
stevedoring
doctrine
seeking
indemnification
of
--
the
amounts
which
they
had
to
pay
to
the
widow.
in
a
counterclaim
of
this
petitioner,
petitioner
sought
to
bring
a
direct
action
against
the
vessel,
the
petitioner
being
a
stevedoring
contractor
and
thought
to
recover
all
the
damages
that
it
was
exposed
to
under
the
longshoremen's
and
harbor
workers'
compensation
act
which
had
a
potential
total
liability
of
$70,000.00.
that
counterclaim
was
dismissed
upon
the
motion
of
the
respondent
in
the
district
court.
the
--
this
vessel
was
affirmed
in
the
seventh
circuit.
we
are
here
on
the
limited
question
and
we
submit
to
this
court
that
the
question
is,
is
there
a
contract,
stevedoring
contract
implied
in
fact
running
directly
between
the
vessel
owner
and
the
stevedoring
contractor?
and
we
submit
the
corollary
question
fairly
encompassed
within
that
issue
is,
does
the
longshoremen's
and
the
harbor
workers'
compensation
act,
acts
as
a
shield
to
the
vessel
owner
to
isolate
the
vessel
owner
from
any
liability
directly
against
the
stevedoring
contractor?
mr.
john
w.
hough
it
is
outside
the
record
your
honor.
mr.
john
w.
hough
there
is
an
allegation
in
the
brief
of
the
respondent
that
the
stevedoring
contract
was
made
between
the
timed
charterer
and
the
--
mr.
john
w.
hough
--
the
stevedoring
contractor.
mr.
john
w.
hough
we
submit
not
your
honor.
the
charterer
is
not
in
control
of
the
vessel.
it's
controlled
in
the
control
--
since
this
insofar
as
before
this
court,
it
was
an
unwritten
contract.
and
the
time
charterer
only
controls
where
the
vessel
is
going,
not
the
crew
or
the
operation
of
the
vessel
by
its
crew,
the
crew
being
under
the
control
of
the
vessel
owner.
the
time
charterer
controlling
the
--
if
the
vessel
is
going
from
one
city
or
one
port
to
another,
we
submit
that
it
is
not
dispositive
at
all
of
this
issue
or
that
it
does
not
fire
this
question.
mr.
john
w.
hough
not
at
all.
it
is
based
on
the
contract.
mr.
john
w.
hough
yes,
your
honor.
but
we
submit
that
this
is
based
purely
on
the
contract.
we
abandon
any
resort
to
a
tort
theory.
mr.
john
w.
hough
i
would
state
bluntly
under
a
tort
theory,
if
we
sued,
we
would
sue
as
subrogee.
mr.
john
w.
hough
yes,
your
honor.
we
would
sue
a
subrogee
and
then
under
the
ryan
doctrine,
the
ship
owner
would
turn
around
and
sue
the
stevedoring
contractor
and
it
--
mr.
john
w.
hough
yes,
your
honor.
but
that
is
not
the
instant
case
before
this
court.
we
suggest
and
urge
to
this
court
that
the
ryan
stevedoring
company
case
in
1956
established
that
there
was
a
stevedoring
contract
even
though
unwritten
which
was
implied
in
fact.
under
the
stevedoring
contract,
certain
duties
were
owed
by
the
stevedoring
contractor
directly
to
the
vessel
owner.
if
a
violation
of
those
duties
by
the
stevedoring
contractor
and
the
very
essence
of
that
duty
having
been
defined
in
that
case
as
being
the
proper
performance
of
the
stevedoring
contract
either
offloading
or
unloading
the
cargo,
if
there
be
a
violation
of
those
duties,
the
vessel
owner
could
recover
complete
indemnification
from
the
stevedoring
contractor
for
any
amount
that
the
vessel
owner
became
obligated
to
pay
to
the
--
to
an
employee
of
the
stevedoring
contractor
who
was
injured
aboard
the
vessel.
that
case
focused
on
side
of
that
relationship.the
duties
owed
by
stevedoring
contractor
to
the
vessel
owner.
it
also
stated
that
the
longshoremen's
and
harbor
workers'
compensation
act
did
not
preclude
the
vessel
owner
from
being
sued
by
the
employee
of
the
stevedoring
contractor
under
a
tort
theory.
and
the
stevedoring
of
the
vessel
owner
turning
around
if
there
was
a
judgment
against
him
by
the
stevedore
and
recovering
the
full
amount
of
that
judgment
directly
from
the
stevedoring
contractor
based
on
a
breach
of
contract
theory,
the
--
this
court
announced
in
that
decision
that
the
tort
theory
was
not
to
be
confused
with
the
contract
theory
that
the
action
by
the
vessel
owner
against
the
stevedoring
contractor
was
directly
based
on
contract
and
not
any
tort
theory.
we
read
in
the
weyerhaeuser
steamship
company
case
in
1958,
the
warning
announced
by
this
court
that
the
vessel
owner
can
be
precluded
from
recovering
directly
from
the
stevedore
contractor
if
there
might
be
conduct
on
its
part
to
preclude
such
recovery.
this
court
did
not
go
further
to
define
what
that
might
be.
in
1959,
in
hugev
versus
dampskisaktieselskabet
international,
the
district
court
which
was
affirmed
by
the
ninth
circuit
and
certiorari
was
denied
by
this
court.
the
district
court
announced
what
the
duties
of
the
vessel
owner
were
under
the
stevedoring
contract
even
though
it
be
unwritten
stating
that
these
were
implied
in
fact.
in
essence
these
duties
were
to
provide
a
reasonable,
reasonably
safe
place
to
work
and
to
give
warning
of
any
latent
danger.
these
duties
we
have
quoted
in
length
in
our
brief
and
i
briefly
summarize
them
but
in
essence
those
are
the
duties.
in
the
hugev
case,
because
the
stevedoring
contractor
knew
of
a
violation
of
these
duties
by
the
vessel
owner
and
thereafter
assumed
the
risk,
recovery
was
denied.
but
these
duties
were
thoroughly
announced
in
that
case.
we
--
in
the
hugev
case,
there
was
a
statement
that
the
stevedoring
contractor
does
not
board
the
vessel
at
its
own
peril.
the
owner
does
not
turn
over
to
the
stevedoring
contractor
a
vessel.
in
any
condition,
we
submit
to
this
court
that
there
must
be
a
reasonable
time
where
the
stevedoring
contractor
to
inspect
that
vessel
and
to
discover
and
correct
any
false
in
that
vessel
that
might
exist.
if
this
ship
owner
can
turnover
to
the
stevedoring
contractor
a
vessel
in
any
condition,
be
there
exports
or
otherwise
which
are
misplaced
for
a
week,
then
we
suggest
this
would
encourage
willful
and
wanton
misconduct
because
under
the
ryan
doctrine,
the
stevedoring
contractor
has
almost
an
absolute
liability
for
indemnification
to
the
vessel
owner.
mr.
john
w.
hough
yes
your
honor,
usually.
usually.
mr.
john
w.
hough
yes
sir.
mr.
john
w.
hough
but
it
doesn't
in
all
cases.
mr.
john
w.
hough
the
--
in
the
hugev
case
it
was
announced.
there
was
a
contract
in
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
w.
hough
of
a
contract?
mr.
john
w.
hough
no,
that
--
and
that
--
mr.
john
w.
hough
(voice
overlap)that
theory
has
never
been
tested
before
--
mr.
john
w.
hough
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
w.
hough
it's
never
been
tested
in
any
court
other
than
in
this
case.
mr.
john
w.
hough
we
have
rights
of
subrogation,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
john
w.
hough
no
your
honor.
before
that
statute
--
mr.
john
w.
hough
(voice
overlap)
both
liabilities.
mr.
john
w.
hough
was
extended
to
without
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
w.
hough
under
the
longshoremen's
and
harbor
workers'
compensation
act,
yes.
the
ryan
case
announced
that
there
was
an
implied
--
in
fact
a
contract.
this
court
has
announced
only
what
duties
flow
from
the
vessel
owner
to
this
--
pardon
me,
from
the
stevedoring
contractor
to
the
vessel
owner
under
that
contract.
this
court
has
never
announced
what
duties
flow
from
the
vessel
owner
to
the
stevedoring
contract
under
that
contract.
we
suggest
that
it's
not
a
unilateral
contract
and
that,
duties
must
flow
from
each
side
to
the
other.
mr.
john
w.
hough
yes
your
honor.
and
that
--
as
your
honor
--
even
though
your
honor
disagreed
with
the
majority
opinion
in
the
ryan
case,
we
rely
on
the
majority
opinion
on
that.
and
since
there
is
a
contract
announced
in
implied
fact,
say
it
has
to
flow
both
ways,
duties
that
they
are
on.
mr.
john
w.
hough
the
implied
duties
are
announced
in
the
hugev
case
and
are
essentially
summarized
as
a
duty
by
the
vessel
owner
to
provide
a
reasonably
safe
place
to
work.
we
don't
say
a
safe
place.
we
don't
say
to
the
--
hand
over
it
and
unseaworthy
or
a
seaworthy
vessel.
we
say
only
a
reasonably
safe
place
to
work.
mr.
john
w.
hough
essentially.
not
invitees,
no,
pardon
me,
just
a
reasonably
safe
place
to
work.
mr.
john
w.
hough
for
the
employees
of
the
stevedoring
contractor
and
for
the
stevedoring
contractor
when
he
puts
his
employees
aboard.
mr.
john
w.
hough
oh,
the
employees
or
the
stevedore
--
it
can
vary.
mr.
john
w.
hough
for
the
--
no,
your
honor
because
under
the
admiralty
law,
to
the
employees
of
the
stevedore
under
the
sieracki
doctrine,
the
vessel
owner
is
to
supply
that
those
employees
with
a
seaworthy
vessel.
that
is
a
liability
without
fault
for
a
violation
thereof.
we
don't
claim
them.
mr.
john
w.
hough
yes,
both.
mr.
john
w.
hough
i
differentiate,
i
must
because
of
the
announcement
of
this
court
between
the
stevedore
contractor
and
his
employees.
i
repeat
under
the
sieracki
doctrine,
the
duty
of
the
vessel
owner
to
supply
to
the
stevedore
employees
--
mr.
john
w.
hough
the
hugev
case
arose
in
a
very
similar
manner
as
the
instant
case
and
an
employee
sued
the
vessel
for
unseaworthy
condition.
mr.
john
w.
hough
that's
--
i
mean,
i
--
i'm
sorry
your
honor
i
relate
previous
cases
that
--
this
is
two,
a
different
cases,
but
this
was
two
cases
below.
the
employee
filed
an
action
against
the
vessel
thereafter
in
this
instant
action
and
a
separate
action,
the
vessel
sought
complete
indemnification
from
the
stevedoring
contractor
under
the
theory
of
the
ryan
case.
the
employer,
defect
contract
as
announced.
mr.
john
w.
hough
and
--
mr.
john
w.
hough
in
this
case,
that's
the
way
this
--
this
latter
case
grew
up
to.
mr.
john
w.
hough
the
same
situation,
an
employee,
a
stevedoring
employee
sued
the
vessel
owner
and
thereafter
the
vessel
owner
sought
indemnification
from
the
stevedoring
contractor.
and
--
mr.
john
w.
hough
the
stevedore
employee
recovered.
mr.
john
w.
hough
against
the
shipowner
and
the
stevedoring
contractor
had
sought
indemnification.
and
was
prohibited
from
it
due
to
the
fact
that
they
had
assumed
the
risk
but
in
the
hugev
case
and
we
have
set
forth
in
out
opening
brief
the
duties
that
the
vessel
owner
owes
directly
to
the
stevedoring
contractor.
the
--
in
the
hugev
case,
the
court
decided
there
was
a
contractor
relationship
directly
between
the
vessel
owner
and
the
stevedoring
contractor
even
though
unwritten.
this
court
has
said
that
in
the
ryan
case
to.
but
this
court
has
never
asked
upon
the
question
of
the
duties
flowing
from
the
vessel
owner
to
the
stevedoring
contractor.
was
never
announced
though,
that's
only
been
announced
below
and
certiorari
has
been
denied
here
--
in
that
case.
now,
it
was
held
by
the
seventh
circuit
that
the
longshoremen's
and
harbor
workers'
compensation
act
isolated
the
vessel
owner
from
all
liability
directly
to
the
stevedoring
contractor.
that
case,
the
decision
rendered
by
the
seventh
circuit
went
further
to
state
that
the
longshoremen's
and
harbor
workers'
compensation
act
is
the
source
of
all
remedies
existent
to
the
stevedoring
contractor
against
the
vessel
owner.
we
submit
to
this
court
that
that
is
far
beyond
the
intendments
of
the
act.
section
904
(a)
imposes
on
the
stevedoring
contractor
a
liability
without
fault.
taking
away
from
the
employee
his
common
law
liability
and
giving
him
a
quid
pro
quo.
section
904
(b)
provides
that
the
liability
of
the
stevedoring
employee
--
employer
is
the
exclusive
liability
to
a
certain
class,
namely
the
stevedore
and
all
persons
claiming
under
and
through
him.
however,
section
933
(i)
of
the
act
warns
that
the
longshoremen's
and
harbor
workers'
compensation
act
only
applies
to
this
class
of
people.
it
does
not
go
further.
the
basic
provision
and
reason
for
the
longshoremen's
and
harbor
workers'
compensation
act
was
to
replace
the
common
law
liability
which
was
only
possible
with
an
absolute
liability
which
was
completely
without
fault
but
a
liability
in
a
lesser
--
a
liability
by
the
stevedoring
contractor
to
his
employees
in
a
--
result
from
a
lesser
liability.
the
act
we
submit
has
no
bearing
whatsoever
on
the
relationship
between
the
stevedoring
contractor
and
the
vessel
owner.
true,
there
is
a
right
to
subrogation
by
the
stevedoring
contractor
to
the
claims
of
his
employees
against
third-party
tort.
these
are
under
section
933
(b)
prior
to
the
ryan
case,
it
was
mandatory.
perhaps
the
dissenting
opinion
in
the
ryan
case
caused
congress
to
change
its
mind
and
amend
it
so
that
now
only
if
the
person
on
--
who
is
entitled
to
compensation
under
the
act
commences
an
action
against
a
third-party
within
that
six
months
after
an
award
of
compensation
is
the
action
assigned.
mr.
john
w.
hough
is
the
cause
of
action
assigned
to
the
employer.
mr.
john
w.
hough
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
respondent
recognize
that
changing
the
law
here
would
perhaps
have
a
decided
impact
on
the
industry
and
that
ryan
changed
the
law
existent
up
to
that
time
and
had
as
have
been
enacted
under
the
longshoremen's
and
harbor
workers'
compensation
act
long
before
the
advent
of
ryan.
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
the
position
of
the
law
now
is
in
the
ninth
circuit,
affirmed
by
the
ninth
circuit,
the
hugev
case
makes
the
very
definite
statement
that
the
law
prompt
the
holding
that
the
ex
--
the
absent
a
span,
they
expressed
a
provision
to
the
contrary.
the
shipowner
owes
to
the
stevedoring
contractor
under
the
stevedoring
contract
the
implied
in
fact
obligations.
the
ninth
circuit
holds
there
is
an
implied
in
fact
contract.
the
seventh
circuit
holds
there
is
none.
we
ask
this
court
to
clarify
the
law
and
we
urge
that
there
is
this
implied
in
fact
contract
under
which
duties
flow
both
ways.
and
secondly,
that
the
longshoremen's
and
harbor
workers'
compensation
act
was
not
designed
to
and
does
not
isolate
the
shipowner
from
liability
to
the
stevedoring
contract
for
a
breach
of
that
contract.
that
act
has
no
bearing
on
that
relationship,
we
suggest
to
this
court.
thank
you.

under
the
ryan
stevedoring
doctrine
seeking
indemnification
of
--
the
amounts
which
they
had
to
pay
to
the
widow.
in
a
counterclaim
of
this
petitioner,
petitioner
sought
to
bring
a
direct
action
against
the
vessel,
the
petitioner
being
a
stevedoring
contractor
and
thought
to
recover
all
the
damages
that
it
was
exposed
to
under
the
longshoremen's
and
harbor
workers'
compensation
act
which
had
a
potential
total
liability
of
$70,000.00.
that
counterclaim
was
dismissed
upon
the
motion
of
the
respondent
in
the
district
court.
the
--
this
vessel
was
affirmed
in
the
seventh
circuit.
we
are
here
on
the
limited
question
and
we
submit
to
this
court
that
the
question
is,
is
there
a
contract,
stevedoring
contract
implied
in
fact
running
directly
between
the
vessel
owner
and
the
stevedoring
contractor?
and
we
submit
the
corollary
question
fairly
encompassed
within
that
issue
is,
does
the
longshoremen's
and
the
harbor
workers'
compensation
act,
acts
as
a
shield
to
the
vessel
owner
to
isolate
the
vessel
owner
from
any
liability
directly
against
the
stevedoring
contractor?
mr.
john
w.
hough
it
is
outside
the
record
your
honor.
mr.
john
w.
hough
there
is
an
allegation
in
the
brief
of
the
respondent
that
the
stevedoring
contract
was
made
between
the
timed
charterer
and
the
--
mr.
john
w.
hough
--
the
stevedoring
contractor.
mr.
john
w.
hough
we
submit
not
your
honor.
the
charterer
is
not
in
control
of
the
vessel.
it's
controlled
in
the
control
--
since
this
insofar
as
before
this
court,
it
was
an
unwritten
contract.
and
the
time
charterer
only
controls
where
the
vessel
is
going,
not
the
crew
or
the
operation
of
the
vessel
by
its
crew,
the
crew
being
under
the
control
of
the
vessel
owner.
the
time
charterer
controlling
the
--
if
the
vessel
is
going
from
one
city
or
one
port
to
another,
we
submit
that
it
is
not
dispositive
at
all
of
this
issue
or
that
it
does
not
fire
this
question.
mr.
john
w.
hough
not
at
all.
it
is
based
on
the
contract.
mr.
john
w.
hough
yes,
your
honor.
but
we
submit
that
this
is
based
purely
on
the
contract.
we
abandon
any
resort
to
a
tort
theory.
mr.
john
w.
hough
i
would
state
bluntly
under
a
tort
theory,
if
we
sued,
we
would
sue
as
subrogee.
mr.
john
w.
hough
yes,
your
honor.
we
would
sue
a
subrogee
and
then
under
the
ryan
doctrine,
the
ship
owner
would
turn
around
and
sue
the
stevedoring
contractor
and
it
--
mr.
john
w.
hough
yes,
your
honor.
but
that
is
not
the
instant
case
before
this
court.
we
suggest
and
urge
to
this
court
that
the
ryan
stevedoring
company
case
in
1956
established
that
there
was
a
stevedoring
contract
even
though
unwritten
which
was
implied
in
fact.
under
the
stevedoring
contract,
certain
duties
were
owed
by
the
stevedoring
contractor
directly
to
the
vessel
owner.
if
a
violation
of
those
duties
by
the
stevedoring
contractor
and
the
very
essence
of
that
duty
having
been
defined
in
that
case
as
being
the
proper
performance
of
the
stevedoring
contract
either
offloading
or
unloading
the
cargo,
if
there
be
a
violation
of
those
duties,
the
vessel
owner
could
recover
complete
indemnification
from
the
stevedoring
contractor
for
any
amount
that
the
vessel
owner
became
obligated
to
pay
to
the
--
to
an
employee
of
the
stevedoring
contractor
who
was
injured
aboard
the
vessel.
that
case
focused
on
side
of
that
relationship.the
duties
owed
by
stevedoring
contractor
to
the
vessel
owner.
it
also
stated
that
the
longshoremen's
and
harbor
workers'
compensation
act
did
not
preclude
the
vessel
owner
from
being
sued
by
the
employee
of
the
stevedoring
contractor
under
a
tort
theory.
and
the
stevedoring
of
the
vessel
owner
turning
around
if
there
was
a
judgment
against
him
by
the
stevedore
and
recovering
the
full
amount
of
that
judgment
directly
from
the
stevedoring
contractor
based
on
a
breach
of
contract
theory,
the
--
this
court
announced
in
that
decision
that
the
tort
theory
was
not
to
be
confused
with
the
contract
theory
that
the
action
by
the
vessel
owner
against
the
stevedoring
contractor
was
directly
based
on
contract
and
not
any
tort
theory.
we
read
in
the
weyerhaeuser
steamship
company
case
in
1958,
the
warning
announced
by
this
court
that
the
vessel
owner
can
be
precluded
from
recovering
directly
from
the
stevedore
contractor
if
there
might
be
conduct
on
its
part
to
preclude
such
recovery.
this
court
did
not
go
further
to
define
what
that
might
be.
in
1959,
in
hugev
versus
dampskisaktieselskabet
international,
the
district
court
which
was
affirmed
by
the
ninth
circuit
and
certiorari
was
denied
by
this
court.
the
district
court
announced
what
the
duties
of
the
vessel
owner
were
under
the
stevedoring
contract
even
though
it
be
unwritten
stating
that
these
were
implied
in
fact.
in
essence
these
duties
were
to
provide
a
reasonable,
reasonably
safe
place
to
work
and
to
give
warning
of
any
latent
danger.
these
duties
we
have
quoted
in
length
in
our
brief
and
i
briefly
summarize
them
but
in
essence
those
are
the
duties.
in
the
hugev
case,
because
the
stevedoring
contractor
knew
of
a
violation
of
these
duties
by
the
vessel
owner
and
thereafter
assumed
the
risk,
recovery
was
denied.
but
these
duties
were
thoroughly
announced
in
that
case.
we
--
in
the
hugev
case,
there
was
a
statement
that
the
stevedoring
contractor
does
not
board
the
vessel
at
its
own
peril.
the
owner
does
not
turn
over
to
the
stevedoring
contractor
a
vessel.
in
any
condition,
we
submit
to
this
court
that
there
must
be
a
reasonable
time
where
the
stevedoring
contractor
to
inspect
that
vessel
and
to
discover
and
correct
any
false
in
that
vessel
that
might
exist.
if
this
ship
owner
can
turnover
to
the
stevedoring
contractor
a
vessel
in
any
condition,
be
there
exports
or
otherwise
which
are
misplaced
for
a
week,
then
we
suggest
this
would
encourage
willful
and
wanton
misconduct
because
under
the
ryan
doctrine,
the
stevedoring
contractor
has
almost
an
absolute
liability
for
indemnification
to
the
vessel
owner.
mr.
john
w.
hough
yes
your
honor,
usually.
usually.
mr.
john
w.
hough
yes
sir.
mr.
john
w.
hough
but
it
doesn't
in
all
cases.
mr.
john
w.
hough
the
--
in
the
hugev
case
it
was
announced.
there
was
a
contract
in
the
(voice

--
mr.
john
w.
hough
of
a
contract?
mr.
john
w.
hough
no,
that
--
and
that
--
mr.
john
w.
hough
(voice

theory
has
never
been

before
--
mr.
john
w.
hough
(voice

--
mr.
john
w.
hough
it's
never
been
tested
in
any
court
other
than
in
this
case.
mr.
john
w.
hough
we
have
rights
of
subrogation,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
john
w.
hough
no
your
honor.
before
that
statute
--
mr.
john
w.
hough
(voice

both
liabilities.
mr.
john
w.
hough
was
extended
to
without
(voice

--
mr.
john
w.
hough
under
the
longshoremen's
and
harbor
workers'
compensation
act,
yes.
the
ryan
case
announced
that
there
was
an
implied
--
in
fact
a
contract.
this
court
has
announced
only
what
duties
flow
from
the
vessel
owner
to
this
--
pardon
me,
from
the
stevedoring
contractor
to
the
vessel
owner
under
that
contract.
this
court
has
never
announced
what
duties
flow
from
the
vessel
owner
to
the
stevedoring
contract
under
that
contract.
we
suggest
that
it's
not
a
unilateral
contract
and
that,
duties
must
flow
from
each
side
to
the
other.
mr.
john
w.
hough
yes
your
honor.
and
that
--
as
your
honor
--
even
though
your
honor
disagreed
with
the
majority
opinion
in
the
ryan
case,
we
rely
on
the
majority
opinion
on
that.
and
since
there
is
a
contract
announced
in
implied
fact,
say
it
has
to
flow
both
ways,
duties
that
they
are
on.
mr.
john
w.
hough
the
implied
duties
are
announced
in
the
hugev
case
and
are
essentially
summarized
as
a
duty
by
the
vessel
owner
to
provide
a
reasonably
safe
place
to
work.
we
don't
say
a
safe
place.
we
don't
say
to
the
--
hand
over
it
and
unseaworthy
or
a
seaworthy
vessel.
we
say
only
a
reasonably
safe
place
to
work.
mr.
john
w.
hough
essentially.
not
invitees,
no,
pardon
me,
just
a
reasonably
safe
place
to
work.
mr.
john
w.
hough
for
the
employees
of
the
stevedoring
contractor
and
for
the
stevedoring
contractor
when
he
puts
his
employees
aboard.
mr.
john
w.
hough
oh,
the
employees
or
the
stevedore
--
it
can
vary.
mr.
john
w.
hough
for
the
--
no,
your
honor
because
under
the
admiralty
law,
to
the
employees
of
the
stevedore
under
the
sieracki
doctrine,
the
vessel
owner
is
to
supply
that
those
employees
with
a
seaworthy
vessel.
that
is
a
liability
without
fault
for
a
violation
thereof.
we
don't
claim
them.
mr.
john
w.
hough
yes,
both.
mr.
john
w.
hough
i
differentiate,
i
must
because
of
the
announcement
of
this
court
between
the
stevedore
contractor
and
his
employees.
i
repeat
under
the
sieracki
doctrine,
the
duty
of
the
vessel
owner
to
supply
to
the
stevedore
employees
--
mr.
john
w.
hough
the
hugev
case
arose
in
a
very
similar
manner
as
the
instant
case
and
an
employee
sued
the
vessel
for
unseaworthy
condition.
mr.
john
w.
hough
that's
--
i
mean,
i
--
i'm
sorry
your
honor
i
relate
previous
cases
that
--
this
is
two,
a
different
cases,
but
this
was
two
cases
below.
the
employee
filed
an
action
against
the
vessel
thereafter
in
this
instant
action
and
a
separate
action,
the
vessel
sought
complete
indemnification
from
the
stevedoring
contractor
under
the
theory
of
the
ryan
case.
the
employer,
defect
contract
as
announced.
mr.
john
w.
hough
and
--
mr.
john
w.
hough
in
this
case,
that's
the
way
this
--
this
latter
case
grew
up
to.
mr.
john
w.
hough
the
same
situation,
an
employee,
a
stevedoring
employee
sued
the
vessel
owner
and
thereafter
the
vessel
owner
sought
indemnification
from
the
stevedoring
contractor.
and
--
mr.
john
w.
hough
the
stevedore
employee
recovered.
mr.
john
w.
hough
against
the
shipowner
and
the
stevedoring
contractor
had
sought
indemnification.
and
was
prohibited
from
it
due
to
the
fact
that
they
had
assumed
the
risk
but
in
the
hugev
case
and
we
have
set
forth
in
out
opening
brief
the
duties
that
the
vessel
owner
owes
directly
to
the
stevedoring
contractor.
the
--
in
the
hugev
case,
the
court
decided
there
was
a
contractor
relationship
directly
between
the
vessel
owner
and
the
stevedoring
contractor
even
though
unwritten.
this
court
has
said
that
in
the
ryan
case
to.
but
this
court
has
never
asked
upon
the
question
of
the
duties
flowing
from
the
vessel
owner
to
the
stevedoring
contractor.
was
never
announced
though,
that's
only
been
announced
below
and
certiorari
has
been
denied
here
--
in
that
case.
now,
it
was
held
by
the
seventh
circuit
that
the
longshoremen's
and
harbor
workers'
compensation
act
isolated
the
vessel
owner
from
all
liability
directly
to
the
stevedoring
contractor.
that
case,
the
decision
rendered
by
the
seventh
circuit
went
further
to
state
that
the
longshoremen's
and
harbor
workers'
compensation
act
is
the
source
of
all
remedies
existent
to
the
stevedoring
contractor
against
the
vessel
owner.
we
submit
to
this
court
that
that
is
far
beyond
the
intendments
of
the
act.
section
904
(a)
imposes
on
the
stevedoring
contractor
a
liability
without
fault.
taking
away
from
the
employee
his
common
law
liability
and
giving
him
a
quid
pro
quo.
section
904
(b)
provides
that
the
liability
of
the
stevedoring
employee
--
employer
is
the
exclusive
liability
to
a
certain
class,
namely
the
stevedore
and
all
persons
claiming
under
and
through
him.
however,
section
933
(i)
of
the
act
warns
that
the
longshoremen's
and
harbor
workers'
compensation
act
only
applies
to
this
class
of
people.
it
does
not
go
further.
the
basic
provision
and
reason
for
the
longshoremen's
and
harbor
workers'
compensation
act
was
to
replace
the
common
law
liability
which
was
only
possible
with
an
absolute
liability
which
was
completely
without
fault
but
a
liability
in
a
lesser
--
a
liability
by
the
stevedoring
contractor
to
his
employees
in
a
--
result
from
a
lesser
liability.
the
act
we
submit
has
no
bearing
whatsoever
on
the
relationship
between
the
stevedoring
contractor
and
the
vessel
owner.
true,
there
is
a
right
to
subrogation
by
the
stevedoring
contractor
to
the
claims
of
his
employees
against
third-party
tort.
these
are
under
section
933
(b)
prior
to
the
ryan
case,
it
was
mandatory.
perhaps
the
dissenting
opinion
in
the
ryan
case
caused
congress
to
change
its
mind
and
amend
it
so
that
now
only
if
the
person
on
--
who
is
entitled
to
compensation
under
the
act
commences
an
action
against
a
third-party
within
that
six
months
after
an
award
of
compensation
is
the
action
assigned.
mr.
john
w.
hough
is
the
cause
of
action
assigned
to
the
employer.
mr.
john
w.
hough
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
respondent
recognize
that
changing
the
law
here
would
perhaps
have
a
decided
impact
on
the
industry
and
that
ryan
changed
the
law
existent
up
to
that
time
and
had
as
have
been
enacted
under
the
longshoremen's
and
harbor
workers'
compensation
act
long
before
the
advent
of
ryan.
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
the
position
of
the
law
now
is
in
the
ninth
circuit,
affirmed
by
the
ninth
circuit,
the
hugev
case
makes
the
very
definite
statement
that
the
law
prompt
the
holding
that
the
ex
--
the
absent
a
span,
they
expressed
a
provision
to
the
contrary.
the
shipowner
owes
to
the
stevedoring
contractor
under
the
stevedoring
contract
the
implied
in
fact
obligations.
the
ninth
circuit
holds
there
is
an
implied
in
fact
contract.
the
seventh
circuit
holds
there
is
none.
we
ask
this
court
to
clarify
the
law
and
we
urge
that
there
is
this
implied
in
fact
contract
under
which
duties
flow
both
ways.
and
secondly,
that
the
longshoremen's
and
harbor
workers'
compensation
act
was
not
designed
to
and
does
not
isolate
the
shipowner
from
liability
to
the
stevedoring
contract
for
a
breach
of
that
contract.
that
act
has
no
bearing
on
that
relationship,
we
suggest
to
this
court.
thank
you.
