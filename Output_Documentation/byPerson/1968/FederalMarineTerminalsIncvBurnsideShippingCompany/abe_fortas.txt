i
beg
your
pardon,
am
i
correct
in
understanding
that
the
question
is
whether
the
liability
imposed
by
the
longshoremen's
act
must
be
born
by
the
stevedore
employer

it
stops
there

whether
he
can
consider
that
as
an
element

recover
therefore
against

shipowner.

your

that

up

$30,000.00
from

the
