justice
potter
stewart
i'm
sufficiently
ignorant
and
naive
in
this
general
field
of
financing
so
that
i
don't
quite
--
i'm
not
quite
sure
i
understand
what
6%
interest
at
10
points
is?
give
me
an
example
of
that.
justice
potter
stewart
in
which
way?
now
give
me
an
example.
justice
potter
stewart
borrower?
justice
potter
stewart
the
borrower.
justice
potter
stewart
the
borrower,
let's
say
the
borrower
borrows
a
million
dollars.
justice
potter
stewart
he
gets
$900,000.00
and
he
pays
6%
interest
on
the
million?
justice
potter
stewart
on
the
million.
justice
potter
stewart
and
what
happens
to
that
difference
of
a
$100,000.00.
justice
potter
stewart
the
borrower
never
gets
that.
justice
potter
stewart
i
could
see
that.
justice
potter
stewart
the
loan
purporst
to
my
example,
it
purports
to
be
a
million
dollar
loan
you
pay
6%
of
a
million
dollar
but
actually
all
you
ever
--
all
the
borrower
ever
gets
get
is
$900,000.00.
justice
potter
stewart
even
though,
i
mean
there's
not
any
sort
of
an
escrow
proposition.
justice
potter
stewart
or
a
conditional
thing
he
just
never
gets
that,
that
less
$100,000.00.
justice
potter
stewart
yeah,
okay.
justice
potter
stewart
i
quite,
can't
quite
see
the
theory
of
the
conspiracy
to
monopolize,
to
monopolize
what
housing
and
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
the
building
of
new
subdivisions
in
louisville?
justice
potter
stewart
well
now
that's
something
short
of
conspiracy
to
monopoly.
justice
potter
stewart
i
suppose
to
every
businessman
is
always
either
on
his
own
or
in
corporation
with
others
trying
to
do
better,
trying
to
obtain
a
larger
share
of
the
business.
justice
potter
stewart
i
didn't
--
well,
what
is
the
theory
of
the
conspiracy
to
monopolize.
my
question
is
to
monopolize
what?
new
housing
building
in
louisville,
in
the
louisville
market
area
or?
justice
potter
stewart
yeah.
justice
potter
stewart
the
money
is
the
equivalent
of
what
unconventional
tie-in
cases
the
copyright
of
product
or
the
patent
of
product.
justice
potter
stewart
and
in
order
to
get
that
money,
you
had
to
take
along
with
it
the
u.s.
steel
houses.
justice
potter
stewart
and
this
is
therefore
exactly
the
opposite
from
a
case
that
i
seem
have
to
remember,
maybe
it
was
the
consent
decree
where
the
person
when
he
bought
a
general
motors
car
and
not
insure
with
general
motors
had
to
go
to
the
general
motors
finance
corporation
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
just
to
get
the
money
--
this
is
exactly
the
opposite
side
of
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
because
they
want
to
make
--
justice
potter
stewart
allegation
warrants
they
want
to
make
a
profit
out
of
a
loan.
justice

i'm
