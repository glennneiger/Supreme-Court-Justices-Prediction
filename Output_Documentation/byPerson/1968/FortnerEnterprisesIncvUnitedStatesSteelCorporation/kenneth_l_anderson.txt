mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
--
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
thank
you,
your
honor,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
antitrust
suit
filed
by
me
and
the
federal
district
for
the
western
district
of
kentucky
in
1962
charging
the
respondents,
united
states
steel
corporation
and
its
wholly
owned
subsidiary
u.s.
steel
homes
credit
corporation
with
conspiring
to
violate
sections
1
and
2
of
the
sherman
act.
the
background
of
the
case
is
that
in
december
of
1959,
mr.
a,
b,
fortner
of
louisville,
kentucky
had
an
interest
in
a
number
of
corporations
and
he
had
been
involved
in
the
real
estate
business,
the
real
estate
development
business
since
approximately
1939.
in
the
period
immediately
prior
to
this
december
1959
term,
mr.
fortner
and
one
of
his
business
associates
and
another
corporation
had
commenced
development
of
a
subdivision
in
the
louisville,
kentucky
in
jefferson
county
area.
they
had
in
fact,
prior
to
december
of
1959,
built
250
conventional
homes
in
this
subdivision
which
was
called
golden
meadow
subdivision.
in
december
of
1959,
mr.
fortner
was
approached
by
representatives
of
the
united
states
steel
corporation
and
their
homes
division
which
manufactures
prefabricated
homes.
these
are
house
packages
that
they
deliver
in
a
--
on
a
truck
or
trailer
van
and
the
builder
has
people
there
to
erect
the
homes.
now
when
these
people
approached
mr.
fortner
they
approached
him
on
the
premise
that
there
were
substantial
financing
benefits
to
be
derived
from
this
second
conspirator
and
we
charged
her
in
this
case
the
--
what
i
call
the
credit
corporation.
this
was
a
financing
subsidiary
and
its
purpose
at
the
beginning
was
to
aid
the
dealer
builders
of
the
homes
division
at
u.s.
steel.
as
we
indicate
in
our
brief,
this
purpose
got
extended
in
1958
just
before
they
--
about
a
year
before
they
started
talking
to
mr.
fortner
and
they
decided
that
they
were
going
to
use
the
financing
as
their
own
people
have
described
it
as
a
tool
to
obtain
sales
of
these
prefabricated
homes.
so
mr.
fortner
had
numerous
discussions
with
these
people
and
financing
offers
i
believe
in
construing
the
evidence
of
course
where
we
are
basically
talking
about
whether
the
summary
judgment
should
have
been
given
against
this
that
the
evidence
should
be
construed
most
favorably
to
our
side
and
not
the
other
side.
and
i
think
that
the
inference
most
reasonably
to
be
drawn
from
this
record
is
that
this
financing
offers
according
to
mr.
fortner's
affidavits
kept
getting
better
and
better
to
the
point
that
they
offered
mr.
fortner
a
100%
money
to
buy
the
land
and
develop
the
land
that
had
not
been
develop
that
was
left
in
the
remainder
of
the
subdivision,
that
they
also
were
going
to
provide
its
construction
money.
all
at
a
6%
interest
in
1/2
points,
now
there
are
substantial
differences
between
this
financing
of
a
100%
at
6%
in
1/2
point
and
other
financing
available,
i
believe,
generally
through
out
the
eastern
portion
of
united
states
and
certainly
in
louisville,
kentucky
area
during
this
time
to
dealer
builders
or
to
builders.
the
conventional
development
and
land
purchase
loan
as
their
own
documents
show
was
a
60%
loan
not
a
100%.
the
other
manufacturers
who
were
supposedly
in
this
financing
business
also
were
offering
6%
interest
but
10
points.
so
that
when
this
offer
came
to
mr.
fortner
this
was
on
exceedingly
attractive
proposition
to
him.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
the
6%
interest
would
be
6%
per
year
and
in
terms
of
the
loan,
the
10
points
would
be
10%
of
the
gross
amount
of
the
loan.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
deducted
when
the
loan
proceeds
are
distributed
a
10%
is
deducted
from
the
amount
that
is
distributed
to
the
person
receiving
the
loan.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
yes,
the
borrower.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
so
that
it
--
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
alright,
he
gets
$900,000.00.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
on
the
million.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
right,
and
has
--
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
well,
as
far
--
it's
in
effect,
if
the
court
please,
a
form
of
usury
which
is
condoned
unfortunately
by
the
courts.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
no,
sir.
that's
why
a
1/2%
and
10%
is
--
they're
so
much
different.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
this
is
why
--
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
right.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
no,
sir.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
he
never
gets
that.
as
mr.
flinn
points
out
in
his
own
brief
that
it's
taken
off
the
time.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
so
that
this
was
substantially
attractive
proposition
to
this
man
who
is
in
business
and
he
has
a
corporation
in
existence
which
is
called
fortner
enterprises,
inc.
that
corporation
had
been
in
existence
for
sometime.
it
has
other
businessmen
do
have
a
corporations
available
from
time
to
time.
the
land
that
was
to
be
the
subject
matter
of
this
arrangement
was
available
in
another
corporation.
so
that
when
it
got
to
the
point
of
this
transaction
being
consummated,
this
corporation
then
had
sold
to
it
by
the
other
corporation
the
land
on
which
they
were
going
to
build
these
homes.
now,
the
kicker
in
the
case
of
course
and
these
people
started
out
talking
to
mr.
fortner
about
homes
and
the
whole
idea
of
this
thing
was
you
got
to
take
their
homes
if
you're
going
to
borrow
this
money
on
these
favorable
terms
from
us.
so,
they
prepared
three
sets
of
documents
a
loan
agreement,
a
mortgage,
and
a
set
of
notes.
and
the
loan
agreement
is
the
key
document
here
because
that
loan
agreement
specifically
provides
that
on
each
lot
in
the
subdivision
which
is
the
subject
matter
of
these
loans
that
there
will
be
erected
a
prefabricated
house
manufactured
by
united
states
steel
in
its
homes
division.
now,
this
loan
agreement
itself
was
an
agreement
between
the
credit
corporation
and
fortner
enterprises,
inc.
united
states
steel
was
not
a
party
to
this
agreement,
they
were
a
third
party,
obviously
beneficiary
of
the
agreement.
the
loan
agreement
goes
on
to
provide
that
if
the
borrower
mr.
fortner
and
his
corporation
doesn't
do
various
things
like
pay
on
the
notes
and
so
forth
including
if
the
borrower
shall
otherwise
fail
to
comply
with
the
terms
of
this
agreement
or
with
the
terms
and
provision
of
the
notes
or
mortgage.
then
in
any
such
a
debt,
at
the
option
of
the
lender
all
obligation
on
it's
part
to
make
further
advances
on
account
of
the
loan
shall
cease
and
the
lender
may
enter
into
possession
of
the
premises
and
perform
any
in
all
work
and
labor
necessary
to
complete
set
improvements
and
direct
said
dwelling
houses.
in
the
said
dwelling
houses
that
they
are
referring
to
are
the
u.s.
field
homes
prefabricated
houses.
so
they
entered
into
this
transaction
mr.
fortner
has
stated
in
his
affidavit
which
is
in
this
record
that
he
would
not
have
purchased
these
homes
but
for
the
unique
character
--
the
attractive
to
him
as
a
consumer
and
businessmen
character
of
the
loans
that
were
offered.
he
started
his
project,
the
record
shows
quite
clearly
that
they
spent
large
sums
of
money
on
advertising
that
they
did,
all
of
the
things
necessary
to
get
the
project
going
in
a
proper
manner.
that
there
were
delays
in
deliveries,
that
there
were
problems.
a
second
loan
was
made
and
at
the
time
that
the
second
loan
was
consummated
to
cover
some
additional
lots
in
the
subdivision
that
became
available
there
had
been
nine
closings
according
to
the
record.
then
after
this
loan
was
consummated
which
did
get
some
additional
capital
into
the
corporation
things
really
began
to
happen.
and
this
is
where
we
get
the
damage
to
fortner
enterprises
because
the
houses
as
they
were
occupied
began
to
reveal
substantial
defects.
they
couldn't
get
along
and
the
reputation
of
the
subdivision
started
going
bad.
mr.
fortner's
salesmen
started
not
wanting
to
come
out
and
sell
the
houses
because
of
the
wavy
walls
and
the
sink
tubs
that
would
swell
up.
so
mr.
fortner
called
these
people
and
said
“look
i
will
meet
every
term
of
this
loan
agreement,
our
people
will
pay
off
this
loan
agreement,
the
money
that
you've
loaned
us
but
please
relieve
us
of
the
restrictive
provision
in
the
contract.
let
us
build
conventional
homes.”
this
was
refused,
this
was
in
december
of
1961
or
january
of
1962,
matters
kept
getting
worst.
so
mr.
hamilton
wrote
the
homes
division
a
letter
saying,
we
just
can't
live
with
this
things
and
they
had
a
meeting.
and
at
the
meeting
they
again,
i
guess
you
would
say
formally
asked
the
credit
corporation
representatives
there,
“let
us
out
of
this,
so
can
pay
you
off,
we're
ready,
willing,
and
able
to
pay
you
off
in
accordance
with
the
terms
of
this
agreement
if
you
will
relieve
us
of
this
tie-in
arrangement
in
this
loan
agreement.”
and
they
were
again
refused
and
told
that
they
were
going
to
insists
that
they
fulfill
every
term
of
the
loan
agreement.
it
was
impossible
to
build
these
homes
and
this
antitrust
suit
was
filed.
a
suit
was
filed
charging
of
course
violation
of
section
1,
the
basis
of
that
conspiracy
to
create
the
tie-in,
the
tie-in
itself
and
on
the
basis
of
a
conspiracy
to
monopolize
between
these
two
corporations
under
section
2
of
the
sherman
act.
the
evidence
is
that
in
1960,
68%
of
all
the
sales
of
the
homes
division
involved
loan
agreements
with
this
type
of
tie-in
provision
in
it.
in
1961
it
was
70%,
in
1962
it
was
75%
of
the
43
people
whose
names
are
listed
in
the
record
to
whom
loans
were
made
in
excess
of
$250,000.00
by
the
credit
corporation,
29
of
those
fell
under
of
what
they
call
their
special
financing
program
which
is
this
program,
where
they
go
beyond
convectional
means
and
used
whatever
really
means
are
necessary
to
capture
a
purchaser
for
these
products
namely
this
--
this
junk
that
they
called
these
prefabricated
houses.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
that
the
--
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
prefabricated
--
house
market,
yes
sir.
this
is
not
a
charge
of
monopolization
but
a
charge
of
conspiracy
to
monopolize
which
i
view
in
terms
of
their
own
record
showing
that
the
purpose
of
this
program
was
to
obtain
for
them
a
larger
share
of
the
market
in
the
prefabricated
home
field.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
well
it
--
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
yes
sir,
and
there
are
proper
ways
to
do
it
and
improper
ways
to
do
it.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
well
i've
regarded
it,
your
honor,
as
their
whole
market
area.
because
the
evidence
is
that
this
was
the
tool
that
they
were
using
in
their
old
market
area
to
obtain
sales
of
this
product.
my
point
in
this
summary
judgment
procedure
is
that
i
have
enough
evidence
in
the
record
to
at
least
create
a
question
of
fact
for
a
trial.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
and
this
is
what
really
this
case
is
all
about.
i
am
here
being
kicked
out
of
court
on
a
motion
for
a
summary
judgment
filed
11
days
before
trial
after
i
have
had
considerable
discovery
over
the
years
with
my
client
mr.
fortner's
deposition
for
example
had
never
been
taken.
so
that
when
i
--
in
the
process
of
getting
ready
for
trial
and
confronted
11
days
before
trial
with
this
motion
for
summary
judgment,
i
prepare
an
affidavit
of
mr.
fortner
and
mr.
howard,
which
affidavits
i
felt
clearly
established
at
least
questions
of
fact
to
be
decided
by
a
jury
and
i'm
knockout
out
on
my
ear.
so
that's
why,
that's
why
i'm
here
i
think
i'm
entitled
to
a
trial.
my
position
all
along
in
this
matter
and
partly
as
a
technical
proposition
has
been
that
the
evidence
in
the
uncontradicted
evidence
in
the
record
fulfills
the
elements
of
an
illegal
tie-in
agreement.
that
we
have
the
necessary
economic
force
present
under
existing
case
law
on
tie-ins
to
establish
the
requisite
economic
power
of
the
respondents
over
the
tying
element.
we
have
the
necessary
--
not
in
substantial
amount
of
interstate
commerce
in
the
tied
element,
i.e.
the
prefabricated
houses
and
we
have
admitted
it's
never
been
denied
but
that
the
tie-in
itself
exists.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
yes
sir,
they
are
section
1.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
that
is
correct,
sir.
and
obviously
i
feel
that
my
--
the
best
thrust
of
my
case
is
the
section
1
violation.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
well,
i'm
sure
that
mr.
flinn
in
his
brief
has
apparently
completely
have
changed
the
respondent's
approach
to
this
matter
and
is
now
i
feel
more
directly
meeting
the
issues
that
are
involved.
there
really
in
his
brief,
what
he
is
doing
is
raising
a
factual
question
as
to
the
economic
power
available
as
to
the
tying
element
in
this
case.
he
is
arguing
innuendo
and
questioning
the
capabilities
of
our
witnesses
whose
affidavits
are
in
the
record.
in
an
attempt
i
feel
to
cast
some
question
on
our
evidence
on
this
point,
i
had
other
witnesses
who
would
collaborate
the
point
of
the
--
a
new
uniqueness,
this
is
not
in
the
record
i
mean
this
is
my
statement
to
the
court.
but
i
had
other
witnesses
who
would
testify
on
this
element
and
--
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
the
element,
your
honor
that
financing
on
the
terms
that
were
offered
to
fortner
enterprises
was
not
available
at
least
in
our
louisville,
kentucky
area
from
any
other
source.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
yes,
they
forced
us
to
buy
the
prefabricated
houses.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
in
order
to
the
get
the
loan,
yes,
sir.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
yes
sir,
on
--
in
order
to
get
the
loan
which
was
of
a
particularly
appealing
nature
to
this
businessman
which,
was
unique
in
it's
properties
and
that
it
was
not
the
conventional-type
loan
shall
we
say.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
yes,
sir.
that's
exactly
--
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
well,
to
the
--
everything
is
correct
mr.
justice
fortas
except
the
question
of
whether,
i
think
it's
the
converse
really
because
the
summary
judgment
was
against
me
not
for
me.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
well,
--
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
well,
the
--
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
the
--
to
--
i'm
not
trying
to
evade
answering
you.
well,
to
me,
the
case
is
a
situation
where
at
least
the
question
exists.
was
there
sufficient
evidence
on
these
elements
of
the
tie-in
arrangement?
either
to
create
an
issue
of
fact
for
a
jury
to
trial
or
even
go
beyond
that
and
my
own
feeling
is
that
the
as
that
the
evidence
is
--
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
well,
i
did
--
to
me
the
--
i'm
accustomed
in
these
tie-in
cases
to
thinking
of
preemption
of
the
market
in
terms
of
the
tied
product
and
not
of
the
tie-in
element.
to
me,
international
salt,
northern
pacific,
loew's,
and
the
recent
perma
life
muffler
case,
all
teach
that
some
economic
power
must
exists
over
the
tying
element
to
enable
it
to
have
the
force
of
a
livre
for
the
purpose
of
creating
the
tie
situation
and
my
point
is
that
in
this
case,
the
evidence
on
the
unique
character
of
these
loans
on
this
terms
satisfies
that
basic
requirement
and
--
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
before
we
sign
the
loan
agreement,
yes
sir.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
yes,
sir.
there's
of
course
the
--
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
yes,
sir.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
i
really
think
that
were
--
your
honor
is
addressing
this
in
terms
of
the
money
being
the
tied
element
instead
tying
element.
the
tying
element
is
the
money.
the
money
was
the
thing
that
was
attractive
on
its
terms.
it
was
the
thing
that
was
attractive
about
(voice
overlap).
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
right.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
that
is
correct.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
yes,
sir,
that's
--
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
this
is
the
opposite
of
that
case
and
that‘s
the
u.s.
v.
general
motors
and
i
believe
we
cited
in
our
brief
and
in
that
case,
the
tying
or
the
financing
was
the
tied
element
in
that
case.
because
they
have
the
--
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
they
want
to
be
sure
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
the
court
--
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
on
these
terms
and
conditions,
yes
sir.
yes
sir.
now
--
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
i
cannot
agree
with
your
honor's
language.
if
you
were
talking
about
the
prefabricated
houses,
that's
--
which
are
the
tying
element.
one
of
the
questions
is,
is
there
are
not
insubstantial
amount
of
interstate
commerce
involved
as
far
as
the
tied
element
is
concerned
which
are
the
houses.
and
here
we
have
i
think
the
record
shows
clearly
a
substantial
amount
of
money
to
meet
that
is
as
far
as
the
financing
is
concerned.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
question
is
not
whether
other
people
were
foreclosed
as
far
as
that
element
is
concerned
but
whether
that
cost
of
the
peculiar
terms
and
conditions
of
this
could
be
used
in
the
market
place
as
livre
to
require
the
tie-in,
in
other
words
the
purchase
of
the
prefabricated
houses.
and
to
me,
this
case
is
very
parallel
to
the
perma
life
mufflers
case
where
this
court,
very
recently,
held
that
there
was
a
case
to
track
on
facts
which
to
me
are
not
as
appealing
as
(inaudible)
because
there
these
--
those
people
made
all
sorts
of
money
out
of
their
franchises
which
they
accepted
because
they
were
advantageous
to
them
in
the
business
community;
whereas
in
our
case
the
tremendous
loss
has
occurred
and
no
opportunity
to
be
relieved
of
the
restrictive
agreement.
so,
i
feel
that
our
case
actually
is
a
stronger
case
in
the
perma
life
mufflers
case
in
which
this
court
said
there's
evidence
of
a
conspiracy
to
restrain
trade
here
under
section
1
of
the
sherman
act
that
the
case
should
be
sent
back
for
trial.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
no,
sir.
they
attempted
at
the
last
minute
to
raise
it
and
the
district
judge
did
not
allow
it
or
did
not
answer
to
be
found.
this
in
effect
what
has
occurred
or
what
has
happened
to
us
in
the
district
court
though,
your
honor
and
in
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
no,
sir
i
didn't
and
i
didn't
for
one
very
simple
reason.
to
me,
the
clayton
act
specifically
speaks
in
terms
of
goods
and
wares.
and
i
have
not
found
the
case
where
the
clayton
act
had
been
applied
to
a
financing
to
loans
of
money.
so
rather
than
--
i
felt
that
i
had
a
clear
face
under
section
1
of
the
sherman
act.
so,
i
didn't
performed
the
record
by
putting
section
3
of
the
clayton
act
into
the
case.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
yes,
sir.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
prefabricated
houses.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
yes,
sir.
they
build
the
package.
they
make
up
--
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
well,
--
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
as
far
as
the
tie-in
situation
is
concerned
of
course,
we
really
don't
need
to
have
a
market.
i
mean
but
being
the
closest
market
is
the
louisville,
jefferson
county,
and
surrounding
area.
i
think
the
evidence
shows
that
it
goes
far
beyond
that
and
covers
the
whole
market
area.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
yes,
sir.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
i
believe
they
are
fairly
equal.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
no,
sir.
that's
what
people
have
talked
about
all
along
here
is
--
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
this
is
the
land,
which
was
effective.
we're
talking
about
approximately
$700,000.00
worth
of
prefabricated
homes.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
and
the
homes
of
the
tied
product
not
the
land.
the
land
is
as
far
as
i'm
concerned,
incidentally
restrained
by
this
but
also,
but
if
the
house
is
--
the
interstate
commerce
in
the
house
is
what
--
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
that
--
your
honor
--
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
the
reputation
of
the
subdivision
had
gotten
so
bad
but
they
have
the
--
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
the
lender
refused
to
ask
permission
to
build
conventional
homes
in
the
subdivision
so
we
could
pay
them
all,
yes
sir.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
well,
i
dispute
the
district
court's
conclusion
on
that
point
on
the
basis
of
a
language
that
i
read
to
the
court
at
the
beginning
of
my
argument
from
the
loan
agreement
which
gives
them
the
right
to
take
possession
of
our
property.
but
this
is
the
same
as
in
international
salt.
they
entered
--
the
lessees
in
international
salt
could
have
canceled
the
leases
and
walked
away.
we
could
have
possibly
paid
these
people
off
but
i
feel
if
the
record
shows
that
because
of
the
bad
reputation
that
this
subdivision
had
gotten
that
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
go
out
and
borrow
the
money
at
that
point
from
anybody
else
to
pay
them
all
for
the
lump
sum.
we
could
and
we're
ready,
willing
and
able
to
pay
this
people
off
on
a
lot
by
lot
basis
as
we
built
conventional
homes
on
it
and
they
wouldn't
let
us
do
it.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
yes,
sir.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
as
the
--
as
the
manner
developed,
yes
sir.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
yes,
sir.
just
as
any
businessman
wants
--
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
yes,
sir.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
sir?
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
that
is
the
issue
--
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
i
was
--
we
were
denied
the
opportunity
to
have
a
trial
before
a
jury
of
these
issues,
your
honor.
these
issues
which
i
---
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
well,
--
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
no,
sir.
the
court
entered
the
summary
judgment
--
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
he
asked
--
he
asked
--
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
well,
he
heard
argument
on
some
issues.
then
the
respondents
at
its
request
prepared
what
he
called
and
what
they
called
findings
of
fact
and
conclusions
of
law
and
they
were
tendered
to
the
court.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
yes,
sir
and
--
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
yes
sir,
at
least
disputed
questions.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
that
is
correct
sir
and
we
had
a
proper
demand
for
jury
trial
in
the
record.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
well,
that
is
the
--
i
believe
that
any
time,
a
court
signs
a
document
called
summary
judgment
that
that
is
suppose
to
be
what
is
the
court
is
intending
to
do.
as
counsel
for
respondents
point
out
even
in
their
brief,
its
obvious
from
reading
the
court's
memorandum
opinion
which
is
really
these
findings
of
fact
in
conclusions
of
law
with
the
name
changed
that
erroneous
grounds
were
relied
on
by
the
court
all
the
way
through.
as
a
matter
of
fact
really,
the
district
judge
just
sort
of
threw
up
his
hands
and
said
i
don't
see
how
financing,
even
if
it's
unique,
can
be
a
tying
element.
that's
not
what
is
in
his
memorandum
because
he
didn't
write
the
memorandum
but
that's
the
basis
on
which
the
case
was
dismissed.
and
to
me,
it's
clearly
wrong.
it's
--
we
were
clearly
entitled
to
a
trial
in
this
case.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
your
honor,
it's
my
position
that
the
record
as
its
stands
now
is
sufficient
to
at
least
create
issues
of
fact
on
the
varying
elements
of
the
tie-in
arrangement
if
not
established
--
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
i
don't
know
your
honor.
i'd
point
it
out
to
the
court
and
then
get
it
--
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
no,
sir.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
no,
sir.
not
in
the
--
under
the
federal
rules
on
the
summary
judgment.
you
simply
enter
a
judgment
saying
the
complaints
dispute.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
well,
except
that
all
the
facts
and
his
memorandum
opinion,
your
honor,
are
the
facts
relied
upon
by
the
respondent.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
yes,
sir
exactly.
thank
you.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
--
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
thank
you,
your
honor,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
antitrust
suit
filed
by
me
and
the
federal
district
for
the
western
district
of
kentucky
in
1962
charging
the
respondents,
united
states
steel
corporation
and
its
wholly
owned
subsidiary
u.s.
steel
homes
credit
corporation
with
conspiring
to
violate
sections
1
and
2
of
the
sherman
act.
the
background
of
the
case
is
that
in
december
of
1959,
mr.
a,
b,
fortner
of
louisville,
kentucky
had
an
interest
in
a
number
of
corporations
and
he
had
been
involved
in
the
real
estate
business,
the
real
estate
development
business
since
approximately
1939.
in
the
period
immediately
prior
to
this
december
1959
term,
mr.
fortner
and
one
of
his
business
associates
and
another
corporation
had
commenced
development
of
a
subdivision
in
the
louisville,
kentucky
in
jefferson
county
area.
they
had
in
fact,
prior
to
december
of
1959,
built
250
conventional
homes
in
this
subdivision
which
was
called
golden
meadow
subdivision.
in
december
of
1959,
mr.
fortner
was
approached
by
representatives
of
the
united
states
steel
corporation
and
their
homes
division
which
manufactures
prefabricated
homes.
these
are
house
packages
that
they
deliver
in
a
--
on
a
truck
or
trailer
van
and
the
builder
has
people
there
to
erect
the
homes.
now
when
these
people
approached
mr.
fortner
they
approached
him
on
the
premise
that
there
were
substantial
financing
benefits
to
be
derived
from
this
second
conspirator
and
we
charged
her
in
this
case
the
--
what
i
call
the
credit
corporation.
this
was
a
financing
subsidiary
and
its
purpose
at
the
beginning
was
to
aid
the
dealer
builders
of
the
homes
division
at
u.s.
steel.
as
we
indicate
in
our
brief,
this
purpose
got
extended
in
1958
just
before
they
--
about
a
year
before
they
started
talking
to
mr.
fortner
and
they
decided
that
they
were
going
to
use
the
financing
as
their
own
people
have
described
it
as
a
tool
to
obtain
sales
of
these
prefabricated
homes.
so
mr.
fortner
had
numerous
discussions
with
these
people
and
financing
offers
i
believe
in
construing
the
evidence
of
course
where
we
are
basically
talking
about
whether
the
summary
judgment
should
have
been
given
against
this
that
the
evidence
should
be
construed
most
favorably
to
our
side
and
not
the
other
side.
and
i
think
that
the
inference
most
reasonably
to
be
drawn
from
this
record
is
that
this
financing
offers
according
to
mr.
fortner's
affidavits
kept
getting
better
and
better
to
the
point
that
they
offered
mr.
fortner
a
100%
money
to
buy
the
land
and
develop
the
land
that
had
not
been
develop
that
was
left
in
the
remainder
of
the
subdivision,
that
they
also
were
going
to
provide
its
construction
money.
all
at
a
6%
interest
in
1/2
points,
now
there
are
substantial
differences
between
this
financing
of
a
100%
at
6%
in
1/2
point
and
other
financing
available,
i
believe,
generally
through
out
the
eastern
portion
of
united
states
and
certainly
in
louisville,
kentucky
area
during
this
time
to
dealer
builders
or
to
builders.
the
conventional
development
and
land
purchase
loan
as
their
own
documents
show
was
a
60%
loan
not
a
100%.
the
other
manufacturers
who
were
supposedly
in
this
financing
business
also
were
offering
6%
interest
but
10
points.
so
that
when
this
offer
came
to
mr.
fortner
this
was
on
exceedingly
attractive
proposition
to
him.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
the
6%
interest
would
be
6%
per
year
and
in
terms
of
the
loan,
the
10
points
would
be
10%
of
the
gross
amount
of
the
loan.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
deducted
when
the
loan
proceeds
are
distributed
a
10%
is
deducted
from
the
amount
that
is
distributed
to
the
person
receiving
the
loan.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
yes,
the
borrower.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
so
that
it
--
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
alright,
he
gets
$900,000.00.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
on
the
million.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
right,
and
has
--
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
well,
as
far
--
it's
in
effect,
if
the
court
please,
a
form
of
usury
which
is
condoned
unfortunately
by
the
courts.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
no,
sir.
that's
why
a
1/2%
and
10%
is
--
they're
so
much
different.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
this
is
why
--
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
right.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
no,
sir.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
he
never
gets
that.
as
mr.
flinn
points
out
in
his
own
brief
that
it's
taken
off
the
time.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
so
that
this
was
substantially
attractive
proposition
to
this
man
who
is
in
business
and
he
has
a
corporation
in
existence
which
is
called
fortner
enterprises,
inc.
that
corporation
had
been
in
existence
for
sometime.
it
has
other
businessmen
do
have
a
corporations
available
from
time
to
time.
the
land
that
was
to
be
the
subject
matter
of
this
arrangement
was
available
in
another
corporation.
so
that
when
it
got
to
the
point
of
this
transaction
being
consummated,
this
corporation
then
had
sold
to
it
by
the
other
corporation
the
land
on
which
they
were
going
to
build
these
homes.
now,
the
kicker
in
the
case
of
course
and
these
people
started
out
talking
to
mr.
fortner
about
homes
and
the
whole
idea
of
this
thing
was
you
got
to
take
their
homes
if
you're
going
to
borrow
this
money
on
these
favorable
terms
from
us.
so,
they
prepared
three
sets
of
documents
a
loan
agreement,
a
mortgage,
and
a
set
of
notes.
and
the
loan
agreement
is
the
key
document
here
because
that
loan
agreement
specifically
provides
that
on
each
lot
in
the
subdivision
which
is
the
subject
matter
of
these
loans
that
there
will
be
erected
a
prefabricated
house
manufactured
by
united
states
steel
in
its
homes
division.
now,
this
loan
agreement
itself
was
an
agreement
between
the
credit
corporation
and
fortner
enterprises,
inc.
united
states
steel
was
not
a
party
to
this
agreement,
they
were
a
third
party,
obviously
beneficiary
of
the
agreement.
the
loan
agreement
goes
on
to
provide
that
if
the
borrower
mr.
fortner
and
his
corporation
doesn't
do
various
things
like
pay
on
the
notes
and
so
forth
including
if
the
borrower
shall
otherwise
fail
to
comply
with
the
terms
of
this
agreement
or
with
the
terms
and
provision
of
the
notes
or
mortgage.
then
in
any
such
a
debt,
at
the
option
of
the
lender
all
obligation
on
it's
part
to
make
further
advances
on
account
of
the
loan
shall
cease
and
the
lender
may
enter
into
possession
of
the
premises
and
perform
any
in
all
work
and
labor
necessary
to
complete
set
improvements
and
direct
said
dwelling
houses.
in
the
said
dwelling
houses
that
they
are
referring
to
are
the
u.s.
field
homes
prefabricated
houses.
so
they
entered
into
this
transaction
mr.
fortner
has
stated
in
his
affidavit
which
is
in
this
record
that
he
would
not
have
purchased
these
homes
but
for
the
unique
character
--
the
attractive
to
him
as
a
consumer
and
businessmen
character
of
the
loans
that
were
offered.
he
started
his
project,
the
record
shows
quite
clearly
that
they
spent
large
sums
of
money
on
advertising
that
they
did,
all
of
the
things
necessary
to
get
the
project
going
in
a
proper
manner.
that
there
were
delays
in
deliveries,
that
there
were
problems.
a
second
loan
was
made
and
at
the
time
that
the
second
loan
was
consummated
to
cover
some
additional
lots
in
the
subdivision
that
became
available
there
had
been
nine
closings
according
to
the
record.
then
after
this
loan
was
consummated
which
did
get
some
additional
capital
into
the
corporation
things
really
began
to
happen.
and
this
is
where
we
get
the
damage
to
fortner
enterprises
because
the
houses
as
they
were
occupied
began
to
reveal
substantial
defects.
they
couldn't
get
along
and
the
reputation
of
the
subdivision
started
going
bad.
mr.
fortner's
salesmen
started
not
wanting
to
come
out
and
sell
the
houses
because
of
the
wavy
walls
and
the
sink
tubs
that
would
swell
up.
so
mr.
fortner
called
these
people
and
said
“look
i
will
meet
every
term
of
this
loan
agreement,
our
people
will
pay
off
this
loan
agreement,
the
money
that
you've
loaned
us
but
please
relieve
us
of
the
restrictive
provision
in
the
contract.
let
us
build
conventional
homes.”
this
was
refused,
this
was
in
december
of
1961
or
january
of
1962,
matters
kept
getting
worst.
so
mr.
hamilton
wrote
the
homes
division
a
letter
saying,
we
just
can't
live
with
this
things
and
they
had
a
meeting.
and
at
the
meeting
they
again,
i
guess
you
would
say
formally
asked
the
credit
corporation
representatives
there,
“let
us
out
of
this,
so
can
pay
you
off,
we're
ready,
willing,
and
able
to
pay
you
off
in
accordance
with
the
terms
of
this
agreement
if
you
will
relieve
us
of
this
tie-in
arrangement
in
this
loan
agreement.”
and
they
were
again
refused
and
told
that
they
were
going
to
insists
that
they
fulfill
every
term
of
the
loan
agreement.
it
was
impossible
to
build
these
homes
and
this
antitrust
suit
was
filed.
a
suit
was
filed
charging
of
course
violation
of
section
1,
the
basis
of
that
conspiracy
to
create
the
tie-in,
the
tie-in
itself
and
on
the
basis
of
a
conspiracy
to
monopolize
between
these
two
corporations
under
section
2
of
the
sherman
act.
the
evidence
is
that
in
1960,
68%
of
all
the
sales
of
the
homes
division
involved
loan
agreements
with
this
type
of
tie-in
provision
in
it.
in
1961
it
was
70%,
in
1962
it
was
75%
of
the
43
people
whose
names
are
listed
in
the
record
to
whom
loans
were
made
in
excess
of
$250,000.00
by
the
credit
corporation,
29
of
those
fell
under
of
what
they
call
their
special
financing
program
which
is
this
program,
where
they
go
beyond
convectional
means
and
used
whatever
really
means
are
necessary
to
capture
a
purchaser
for
these
products
namely
this
--
this
junk
that
they
called
these
prefabricated
houses.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
that
the
--
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
prefabricated
--
house
market,
yes
sir.
this
is
not
a
charge
of
monopolization
but
a
charge
of
conspiracy
to
monopolize
which
i
view
in
terms
of
their
own
record
showing
that
the
purpose
of
this
program
was
to
obtain
for
them
a
larger
share
of
the
market
in
the
prefabricated
home
field.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
well
it
--
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
yes
sir,
and
there
are
proper
ways
to
do
it
and
improper
ways
to
do
it.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
well
i've
regarded
it,
your
honor,
as
their
whole
market
area.
because
the
evidence
is
that
this
was
the
tool
that
they
were
using
in
their
old
market
area
to
obtain
sales
of
this
product.
my
point
in
this
summary
judgment
procedure
is
that
i
have
enough
evidence
in
the
record
to
at
least
create
a
question
of
fact
for
a
trial.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
and
this
is
what
really
this
case
is
all
about.
i
am
here
being
kicked
out
of
court
on
a
motion
for
a
summary
judgment
filed
11
days
before
trial
after
i
have
had
considerable
discovery
over
the
years
with
my
client
mr.
fortner's
deposition
for
example
had
never
been
taken.
so
that
when
i
--
in
the
process
of
getting
ready
for
trial
and
confronted
11
days
before
trial
with
this
motion
for
summary
judgment,
i
prepare
an
affidavit
of
mr.
fortner
and
mr.
howard,
which
affidavits
i
felt
clearly
established
at
least
questions
of
fact
to
be
decided
by
a
jury
and
i'm
knockout
out
on
my
ear.
so
that's
why,
that's
why
i'm
here
i
think
i'm
entitled
to
a
trial.
my
position
all
along
in
this
matter
and
partly
as
a
technical
proposition
has
been
that
the
evidence
in
the
uncontradicted
evidence
in
the
record
fulfills
the
elements
of
an
illegal
tie-in
agreement.
that
we
have
the
necessary
economic
force
present
under
existing
case
law
on
tie-ins
to
establish
the
requisite
economic
power
of
the
respondents
over
the
tying
element.
we
have
the
necessary
--
not
in
substantial
amount
of
interstate
commerce
in
the
tied
element,
i.e.
the
prefabricated
houses
and
we
have
admitted
it's
never
been
denied
but
that
the
tie-in
itself
exists.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
yes
sir,
they
are
section
1.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
that
is
correct,
sir.
and
obviously
i
feel
that
my
--
the
best
thrust
of
my
case
is
the
section
1
violation.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
well,
i'm
sure
that
mr.
flinn
in
his
brief
has
apparently
completely
have
changed
the
respondent's
approach
to
this
matter
and
is
now
i
feel
more
directly
meeting
the
issues
that
are
involved.
there
really
in
his
brief,
what
he
is
doing
is
raising
a
factual
question
as
to
the
economic
power
available
as
to
the
tying
element
in
this
case.
he
is
arguing
innuendo
and
questioning
the
capabilities
of
our
witnesses
whose
affidavits
are
in
the
record.
in
an
attempt
i
feel
to
cast
some
question
on
our
evidence
on
this
point,
i
had
other
witnesses
who
would
collaborate
the
point
of
the
--
a
new
uniqueness,
this
is
not
in
the
record
i
mean
this
is
my
statement
to
the
court.
but
i
had
other
witnesses
who
would
testify
on
this
element
and
--
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
the
element,
your
honor
that
financing
on
the
terms
that
were
offered
to
fortner
enterprises
was
not
available
at
least
in
our
louisville,
kentucky
area
from
any
other
source.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
yes,
they
forced
us
to
buy
the
prefabricated
houses.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
in
order
to
the
get
the
loan,
yes,
sir.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
yes
sir,
on
--
in
order
to
get
the
loan
which
was
of
a
particularly
appealing
nature
to
this
businessman
which,
was
unique
in
it's
properties
and
that
it
was
not
the
conventional-type
loan
shall
we
say.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
yes,
sir.
that's
exactly
--
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
well,
to
the
--
everything
is
correct
mr.
justice
fortas
except
the
question
of
whether,
i
think
it's
the
converse
really
because
the
summary
judgment
was
against
me
not
for
me.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
well,
--
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
well,
the
--
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
the
--
to
--
i'm
not
trying
to
evade
answering
you.
well,
to
me,
the
case
is
a
situation
where
at
least
the
question
exists.
was
there
sufficient
evidence
on
these
elements
of
the
tie-in
arrangement?
either
to
create
an
issue
of
fact
for
a
jury
to
trial
or
even
go
beyond
that
and
my
own
feeling
is
that
the
as
that
the
evidence
is
--
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
well,
i
did
--
to
me
the
--
i'm
accustomed
in
these
tie-in
cases
to
thinking
of
preemption
of
the
market
in
terms
of
the
tied
product
and
not
of
the
tie-in
element.
to
me,
international
salt,
northern
pacific,
loew's,
and
the
recent
perma
life
muffler
case,
all
teach
that
some
economic
power
must
exists
over
the
tying
element
to
enable
it
to
have
the
force
of
a
livre
for
the
purpose
of
creating
the
tie
situation
and
my
point
is
that
in
this
case,
the
evidence
on
the
unique
character
of
these
loans
on
this
terms
satisfies
that
basic
requirement
and
--
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
before
we
sign
the
loan
agreement,
yes
sir.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
yes,
sir.
there's
of
course
the
--
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
yes,
sir.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
i
really
think
that
were
--
your
honor
is
addressing
this
in
terms
of
the
money
being
the
tied
element
instead
tying
element.
the
tying
element
is
the
money.
the
money
was
the
thing
that
was
attractive
on
its
terms.
it
was
the
thing
that
was
attractive
about
(voice
overlap).
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
right.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
that
is
correct.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
yes,
sir,
that's
--
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
this
is
the
opposite
of
that
case
and
that‘s
the
u.s.
v.
general
motors
and
i
believe
we
cited
in
our
brief
and
in
that
case,
the
tying
or
the
financing
was
the
tied
element
in
that
case.
because
they
have
the
--
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
they
want
to
be
sure
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
the
court
--
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
on
these
terms
and
conditions,
yes
sir.
yes
sir.
now
--
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
i
cannot
agree
with
your
honor's
language.
if
you
were
talking
about
the
prefabricated
houses,
that's
--
which
are
the
tying
element.
one
of
the
questions
is,
is
there
are
not
insubstantial
amount
of
interstate
commerce
involved
as
far
as
the
tied
element
is
concerned
which
are
the
houses.
and
here
we
have
i
think
the
record
shows
clearly
a
substantial
amount
of
money
to
meet
that
is
as
far
as
the
financing
is
concerned.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
question
is
not
whether
other
people
were
foreclosed
as
far
as
that
element
is
concerned
but
whether
that
cost
of
the
peculiar
terms
and
conditions
of
this
could
be
used
in
the
market
place
as
livre
to
require
the
tie-in,
in
other
words
the
purchase
of
the
prefabricated
houses.
and
to
me,
this
case
is
very
parallel
to
the
perma
life
mufflers
case
where
this
court,
very
recently,
held
that
there
was
a
case
to
track
on
facts
which
to
me
are
not
as
appealing
as
(inaudible)
because
there
these
--
those
people
made
all
sorts
of
money
out
of
their
franchises
which
they
accepted
because
they
were
advantageous
to
them
in
the
business
community;
whereas
in
our
case
the
tremendous
loss
has
occurred
and
no
opportunity
to
be
relieved
of
the
restrictive
agreement.
so,
i
feel
that
our
case
actually
is
a
stronger
case
in
the
perma
life
mufflers
case
in
which
this
court
said
there's
evidence
of
a
conspiracy
to
restrain
trade
here
under
section
1
of
the
sherman
act
that
the
case
should
be
sent
back
for
trial.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
no,
sir.
they
attempted
at
the
last
minute
to
raise
it
and
the
district
judge
did
not
allow
it
or
did
not
answer
to
be
found.
this
in
effect
what
has
occurred
or
what
has
happened
to
us
in
the
district
court
though,
your
honor
and
in
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
no,
sir
i
didn't
and
i
didn't
for
one
very
simple
reason.
to
me,
the
clayton
act
specifically
speaks
in
terms
of
goods
and
wares.
and
i
have
not
found
the
case
where
the
clayton
act
had
been
applied
to
a
financing
to
loans
of
money.
so
rather
than
--
i
felt
that
i
had
a
clear
face
under
section
1
of
the
sherman
act.
so,
i
didn't
performed
the
record
by
putting
section
3
of
the
clayton
act
into
the
case.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
yes,
sir.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
prefabricated
houses.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
yes,
sir.
they
build
the
package.
they
make
up
--
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
well,
--
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
as
far
as
the
tie-in
situation
is
concerned
of
course,
we
really
don't
need
to
have
a
market.
i
mean
but
being
the
closest
market
is
the
louisville,
jefferson
county,
and
surrounding
area.
i
think
the
evidence
shows
that
it
goes
far
beyond
that
and
covers
the
whole
market
area.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
yes,
sir.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
i
believe
they
are
fairly
equal.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
no,
sir.
that's
what
people
have
talked
about
all
along
here
is
--
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
this
is
the
land,
which
was
effective.
we're
talking
about
approximately
$700,000.00
worth
of
prefabricated
homes.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
and
the
homes
of
the
tied
product
not
the
land.
the
land
is
as
far
as
i'm
concerned,
incidentally
restrained
by
this
but
also,
but
if
the
house
is
--
the
interstate
commerce
in
the
house
is
what
--
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
that
--
your
honor
--
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
the
reputation
of
the
subdivision
had
gotten
so
bad
but
they
have
the
--
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
the
lender
refused
to
ask
permission
to
build
conventional
homes
in
the
subdivision
so
we
could
pay
them
all,
yes
sir.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
well,
i
dispute
the
district
court's
conclusion
on
that
point
on
the
basis
of
a
language
that
i
read
to
the
court
at
the
beginning
of
my
argument
from
the
loan
agreement
which
gives
them
the
right
to
take
possession
of
our
property.
but
this
is
the
same
as
in
international
salt.
they
entered
--
the
lessees
in
international
salt
could
have
canceled
the
leases
and
walked
away.
we
could
have
possibly
paid
these
people
off
but
i
feel
if
the
record
shows
that
because
of
the
bad
reputation
that
this
subdivision
had
gotten
that
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
go
out
and
borrow
the
money
at
that
point
from
anybody
else
to
pay
them
all
for
the
lump
sum.
we
could
and
we're
ready,
willing
and
able
to
pay
this
people
off
on
a
lot
by
lot
basis
as
we
built
conventional
homes
on
it
and
they
wouldn't
let
us
do
it.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
yes,
sir.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
as
the
--
as
the
manner
developed,
yes
sir.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
yes,
sir.
just
as
any
businessman
wants
--
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
yes,
sir.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
sir?
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
that
is
the
issue
--
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
i
was
--
we
were
denied
the
opportunity
to
have
a
trial
before
a
jury
of
these
issues,
your
honor.
these
issues
which
i
---
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
well,
--
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
no,
sir.
the
court
entered
the
summary
judgment
--
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
he
asked
--
he
asked
--
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
well,
he
heard
argument
on
some
issues.
then
the
respondents
at
its
request
prepared
what
he
called
and
what
they
called
findings
of
fact
and
conclusions
of
law
and
they
were
tendered
to
the
court.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
yes,
sir
and
--
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
yes
sir,
at
least
disputed
questions.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
that
is
correct
sir
and
we
had
a
proper
demand
for
jury
trial
in
the
record.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
well,
that
is
the
--
i
believe
that
any
time,
a
court
signs
a
document
called
summary
judgment
that
that
is
suppose
to
be
what
is
the
court
is
intending
to
do.
as
counsel
for
respondents
point
out
even
in
their
brief,
its
obvious
from
reading
the
court's
memorandum
opinion
which
is
really
these
findings
of
fact
in
conclusions
of
law
with
the
name
changed
that
erroneous
grounds
were
relied
on
by
the
court
all
the
way
through.
as
a
matter
of
fact
really,
the
district
judge
just
sort
of
threw
up
his
hands
and
said
i
don't
see
how
financing,
even
if
it's
unique,
can
be
a
tying
element.
that's
not
what
is
in
his
memorandum
because
he
didn't
write
the
memorandum
but
that's
the
basis
on
which
the
case
was
dismissed.
and
to
me,
it's
clearly
wrong.
it's
--
we
were
clearly
entitled
to
a
trial
in
this
case.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
your
honor,
it's
my
position
that
the
record
as
its
stands
now
is
sufficient
to
at
least
create
issues
of
fact
on
the
varying
elements
of
the
tie-in
arrangement
if
not
established
--
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
i
don't
know
your
honor.
i'd
point
it
out
to
the
court
and
then
get
it
--
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
no,
sir.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
no,
sir.
not
in
the
--
under
the
federal
rules
on
the
summary
judgment.
you
simply
enter
a
judgment
saying
the
complaints
dispute.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
well,
except
that
all
the
facts
and
his
memorandum
opinion,
your
honor,
are
the
facts
relied
upon
by
the
respondent.
mr.
kenneth
l.
anderson
yes,
sir
exactly.
thank
you.
