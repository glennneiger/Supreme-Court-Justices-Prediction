mr.
macdonald
flinn
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
subject
to
the
wishes
of
the
court
i
planned
that
the
bulk
of
my
argument
today
to
what
conceive
to
be
the
central
legal
issue
in
this
case,
that
issue
turns
upon
the
first
of
the
two
elements
requisite
the
proof
of
a
sherman
act
per
se
time
violation.
specifically
the
question
raised
is
this,
if
the
court
drawing
every
reasonable
inference
in
favor
of
the
plaintiff
concludes
that
the
evidence
shows
that
defendants
financing
of
the
plaintiffs
was
one
more
favorable
terms
that
are
available
from
any
other
source,
there's
that
fact
standing
by
itself
established
the
requisite
sufficient
economic
power
over
the
tying
element
to
appreciably
restrain
trade
in
the
tied
product,
here
prefabricated
homes.
first,
i
would
like
to
touch
briefly
upon
the
facts
and
two
subsidiary
issues.
the
plaintiff
has
argued
that
summary
judgment
was
inappropriate
but
discovery
was
full
and
complete.
to
my
knowledge
there
was
never
any
claim
by
plaintiff
that
additional
facts
needed
to
be
put
in
the
record,
there
was
never
any
request
when
the
defendant
summary
judgment
motion
was
filed
for
additional
time
to
prepare
affidavits
or
otherwise
come
forward
with
the
showing
that
rule
56
(e)
requires
that
there
is
evidence
on
material
facts
in
dispute.
in
addition,
the
plaintiff
has
advised
this
court
as
it
did
the
courts
below
that
all
of
the
evidence
essential
to
its
case
is
in
the
record
now
before
the
court.
on
that
record
--
mr.
macdonald
flinn
mr.
justice
we
urge
this
court
to
draw
its
own
inferences
and
i
am
sure
that
the
court
will
draw
those
inferences
fully
in
favor
of
the
plaintiff.
we
recognize
that
that
is
the
burden
upon
us,
we
welcome
it.
mr.
macdonald
flinn
sherman
act,
sir.
mr.
macdonald
flinn
mr.
justice
there
was
per
curiam
affirmance
by
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
macdonald
flinn
i
believe
that
as
a
fair
interpretation.
mr.
macdonald
flinn
very
well,
your
honor
and
i
would
say
before
attempting
to
answer
to
this
question
we
do
urge
that
regardless
of
the
basis
for
the
district
court's
decision
in
reliance
upon
helvering
and
gowran
on
the
unbroken
line
of
precedence.
in
a
summary
judgment
situation
such
as
urged
here
where
only
questions
of
law
are
presented
to
the
reviewing
court
both
the
court
of
appeals
and
this
court,
whether
or
not
the
grounds
stated
by
the
district
court
were
right
or
leave
out
or
ambiguous,
this
court
is
as
fully
able
as
the
district
court
was
to
reach
the
purely
legal
conclusions
that
are
necessary
in
these
circumstances.
in
essence,
i
think
the
one
aspect
to
the
district
court
decision
which
plaintiff
has
most
frequently
pointed
to
as
suggesting
that
there
was
a
misconception
on
the
part
of
the
district
judge
as
to
what
was
requisite
to
establish
a
cause
of
action
for
per
se
time
violation
under
section
1
whether
embellished
or
not
by
a
section
2
conspiracy
to
monopolize
charge
was
the
district
court's
reference
to
the
amount
of
land
that
was
affected
by
the
arrangement
between
these
parties
in
comparison
with
the
total
land
that
was
available
in
louisville,
kentucky
for
house
developed.
i
would
urge
that
clearly
that
market
fact
by
itself
should
not
be
determinative
in
a
per
se
time
situation.
i
would
urge
equally
strongly
however,
that
the
fact
is
clearly
not
irrelevant
to
the
facts
of
the
these
cases
where
the
tying
arrangement
is
one
between
if
you
will
a
raw
material
supplier
and
his
dealer,
a
middleman
who
is
taking
the
houses
and
then
making
them
available
to
the
ultimate
consumers,
the
house
residents.
i
submit
that
in
terms
of
a
full
analysis
of
this
kind
of
tying
arrangement
it
is
a
appropriate
to
look
to
the
question
where
other
prefabricated
house
manufacturers
were
the
sellers
of
conventional
house
building
materials
and
any
significantly
way
excluded
from
the
market
whether
it's
confined
to
louisville,
kentucky
or
more
broadly.
now,
if
i
may
try
to
articulate
our
position,
so
that
the
court
understands
clearly
why
we
urge
that
summary
adjustment
judgment
is
appropriate
on
this
case,
i
will
proceed.
mr.
macdonald
flinn
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
macdonald
flinn
i
would
urge
not,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
macdonald
flinn
in
now
way.
now
--
mr.
macdonald
flinn
i'm
going
to
urge
mr.
chief
justice
that
the
monopolization
theory
as
i
understand
it
to
be
stated
in
the
petition
and
the
plaintiff's
main
brief
before
this
court
is
not
properly
before
this
court.
mr.
macdonald
flinn
i
am
going
to
argue
very
--
i
am
going
to
argue
very
simply
and
succinctly
mr.
chief
justice
that
this
record
is
barren
of
the
requisite
evidence
to
evidence
to
establish
the
elements
of
a
conspiracy
to
monopolize
specific
intent
the
relevant
market
in
this
as
mr.
justice
brennan
suggested.
i
believe
that
your
decision
in
walker
process,
three
terms
ago,
indicates
that
in
attempt
our
conspiracy
to
monopolize
the
relevant
market
is
an
issue.
as
i
believe
mr.
justice
brennan's
question
suggest
correctly
there
would
be
a
most
substantial
case
of
question
in
this
case
as
to
whether
the
market
can
be
limited
to
prefabricated
houses
or
whether
the
element
of
cross-elasticity
of
demand
does
not
bring
conventional
houses
into
the
market.
now,
on
that
in
essence
is
my
argument
under
conspiracy
to
monopolize
a
part
from
my
principal
argument
that
the
kind
of
conspiracy
to
monopolize
which
i
understand
the
plaintiff
to
be
urging
now
was
never
urged
before
either
the
district
court
or
the
court
of
appeals.
now,
back
to
the
summary
judgment
if
i
may,
we
urge
the
court
and
we
know
that
it
will
and
should
reach
its
own
determination
as
to
what
the
reasonable
inferences
to
be
drawn
from
this
record
are.
we
submit
that
plaintiff
has
not
shown
any
fact
material
to
its
antitrust
claim
to
be
in
dispute
to
require
resolution
by
a
jury
whether
in
terms
of
witness
credibility,
conflicting
evidence
or
otherwise.
in
fact,
the
plaintiff
has
claimed
continuously
indeed
in
his
main
brief
to
this
court
that
on
this
record
it
is
entitled
to
a
directed
verdict.
now,
in
those
circumstances
i
submit
that
there
can
be
no
question
but
that
summary
judgment
is
appropriate
that
the
question
is
what
--
mr.
macdonald
flinn
financing,
yes
sir.
mr.
macdonald
flinn
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
macdonald
flinn
i
believe
that
is
right.
mr.
macdonald
flinn
if
there
were
any
disputed
issues
in
fact,
yes
mr.
justice.
mr.
macdonald
flinn
now--
mr.
macdonald
flinn
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
macdonald
flinn
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
if
i
may
very
briefly
return
to
and
disposed
of
my
argument
in
connection
with
this
summary
judgment
question,
i
would
like
to
briefly
state
some
consideration
which
i
hope
will
assist
the
court
and
in
any
event
make
clear
the
defendants'
position.
at
most,
we
have
differed
with
the
plaintiff
only
as
to
some
of
it's
characterizations
of
the
evidence.
in
our
brief,
we
have
tried
to
set
forth
the
evidence
of
records
cited
by
the
plaintiff
essentially
verbatim
from
the
record
and
have
compared
it
with
a
certain
characterizations
by
the
plaintiff.
i
think
that
clearly
the
most
perhaps
the
only
significant
area
where
we
differ
with
the
plaintiff's
characterizations
is
in
connection
with
the
evidence
relied
upon
by
the
plaintiff
to
establish
it's
claim
that
the
defendants'
financing
extended
to
the
plaintiffs
was
on
more
favorable
terms
than
available
from
any
other
source
including
our
competitors,
other
prefabricated
manufacturers.
but
in
the
final
analysis
that
the
determination
is
for
the
court
and
for
the
court
alone,
and
we
expect
the
court
to
draw
every
reasonable
inference
in
favor
of
the
plaintiff
and
if
the
in
--
mr.
macdonald
flinn
mr.
justice
white,
i
would
answer
--
mr.
macdonald
flinn
mr.
justice,
i
would
answer
that
question
by
saying
that
i
think
upon
the
plaintiff's
own
characterization
of
the
record,
i.e.
that
it
is
a
record
that
entitles
it
to
directed
verdict.
it
is
quite
possible
that
after
a
trial
with
the
jury
sitting
and
hearing
the
evidence
there
would
have
been
no
submission
to
the
jury
that
the
court
would
have
directed
the
verdict
--
mr.
macdonald
flinn
yes,
sir.
i'm
prepared
to
say
that.
on
this
record
--
mr.
macdonald
flinn
i
do
say
it,
mr.
justice.
mr.
macdonald
flinn
that
in
essence
is
my
argument
mr.
justice
because
we
are
prepared
to
accept
any
inferences
that
the
plaintiffs
can
reasonably
argue
from
this
record.
and
they
have
told
us,
they
have
to
the
court
that
the
record
is
complete.
and
indeed
today,
i
believe
the
plaintiff's
counsel
has
advised
the
court
that
at
most
any
other
evidence
that
he
would
have
put
on
would
have
been
cumulative
of
what
is
now
in
this
record
before
the
court.
now,
for
the
balance
of
my
argument,
i
shall
assume
arguendo
that
the
plaintiff's
claim
that
the
defendants'
financing
was
extended
on
a
more
favorable
terms
than
available
elsewhere
is
the
fair
inference
and
in
the
inference
that
this
court
will
draw
because
as
i
am
find
to
make
clear
we
in
no
way
dispute
the
evidence
and
we
will
accept
whatever
the
court
concludes
are
the
reasonable
inferences
from
that
evidence.
i
would
like
to
point
only
to
one
aspect
of
this
record
and
ask
the
court
particularly
to
notice,
nowhere
is
there
any
evidence
that
the
plaintiff
objected
the
defendants'
houses
or
in
any
way
found
the
burdensome
or
noncompetitive
at
the
time
these
arrangements
were
negotiated
and
entered
into.
similarly,
there
is
no
evidence
that
the
plaintiff
would
have
bought
houses
or
building
materials
from
any
other
source
absent
to
financing
that
was
made
available
to
it
by
the
defendants.
mr.
macdonald
flinn
i
am
assuming
mr.
justice
that
the
loan
was
offered,
the
commitment
was
made
on
more
favorable
terms
than
were
available
elsewhere
to
this
plaintiff.
mr.
macdonald
flinn
i
will
argue
that
that
is
not
uniqueness
within
the
sense
of
the
per
se
doctrines
spelled
out
in
loew's
case.
mr.
macdonald
flinn
exactly.
exactly,
it
does
not
permit
such
an
inference
mr.
justice.
mr.
macdonald
flinn
that
would
be
a
second
prong
to
my
argument.
i
think
very
honestly
mr.
justice,
the
more
significant
argument
is
that,
the
claim,
that
a
tying
element
involves
sufficient
the
economic
power
appreciably
the
restrain
commerce
--
mr.
macdonald
flinn
definitely.
mr.
macdonald
flinn
clearly
mr.
justice,
i
must
face
up
to
that
case.
now
to
dispose
of
what
i
believe
is
the
last
subsidiary
issue.
this
question
of
the
conspiracy
to
monopolize,
our
position
is
very
simple.
we
admit
that
the
plaintiff
has
always
alleged
and
argued
a
conspiracy
to
monopolize
in
violation
of
section
2.
the
point
we
make
is
very
simple.
before
both
courts
below
and
indeed
we
think
on
a
fair
reading
of
the
plaintiff's
brief
before
this
court,
it
has
always
urged
that
that
conspiracy
indeed
its
entire
case
turned
upon
the
existence
of
a
per
se
time
violation
either
as
the
objective
or
the
means
of
affecting
the
violation
of
both
sections
1
and
2
to
the
extent
that
the
plaintiff's
brief
and
i
am
still
uncertain
after
listening
to
counsel's
argument
today
but
to
the
extent
that
plaintiff's
brief
argues
before
this
court
that
its
conspiracy
to
monopolize
does
not
turned
upon,
does
not
require
proof
of
a
per
se
time
violation.
that
is
an
argument
that
was
never
presented
to
the
courts
below.
now,
turning
to
this
--
mr.
macdonald
flinn
mr.
justice,
my
idea
of
loew's
is
that
honestly,
i
don't
know
exactly
what
the
court
meant
when
it
use
the
term
unique
there.
i
would
like
to
discuss
that
case
in
considerable
detail
as
well
as
its
place
against
the
background
of
all
these
courts
significant
time
rule
cases.
now,
let's
again
come
back
to
the
basic
--
mr.
macdonald
flinn
no
question
about
that
mr.
justice,
if
i
can
give
any
assistance
that
would
be
the
only
reason
from
my
offering
argument.
to
come
to
back
to
the
central
contention
by
the
plaintiff,
it's
very
simple.
it
claims
that
because
the
financing
extended
by
defendant
require
the
plaintiff
to
place
no
equity
into
the
land
portion
of
the
loan
commitment
which
was
something
else
than
15%
of
the
total
commitment
extended
by
the
defendants.
this
was
more
favorable
and
available
from
any
other
source
and
therefore
within
the
meaning
of
the
loew's
case
was
unique
and
consequently
establishes
the
requisite
sufficient
economic
power
over
the
tying
element.
our
contention
very
simply
is
that
as
a
matter
of
logic
supported
by
the
decision
of
this
court,
you
cannot
infer
simply
from
the
fact
that
the
time
element
is
offered
on
more
favorable
terms
than
available
elsewhere
that
there
is
economic
power
in
that
tying
element.
now
coming
mr.
justice
white
to
the
loew's
decision,
as
this
court
well
knows
it
involved
the
block-booking
of
copyrighted
movie
films.
it
held
that
the
requisite
economic
power
over
the
time
element,
it
presumed
when
the
tying
element
is
either
patented
or
copyrighted.
moreover,
as
the
court
well
knows,
the
tied
products
there
were
frequently
forced
upon
unwilling
purchases.
now,
outside
the
patent
and
copyright
areas,
i
urged
that
the
court
has
not
defined
uniqueness
and
i
concede
my
inability
to
tell
this
court
what
it
meant
when
it
use
the
term
unique
in
the
loew's
case.
i
would
urge
however
that
to
the
extent
that
it
coupled
with
that
a
reference
to
desirability
to
consumers,
i
think
that
this
must
as
a
matter
of
common
sense
than
intended
by
the
court
to
mean
something
more
than
desirable
in
the
sense
that
one
consumer
buys
10
cents
worth
of
a
tying
element.
that
would
establish
sufficient
economic
power
and
practically
every
product
is
sold.
i
think
the
court
meant
something
in
terms
of
some
in
addition
of
meaningful
economic
power.
indeed,
the
court
has
never
merely
assumed
the
existence
of
economic
power
and
i
would
point
to
the
other
significant
tying
decisions
of
the
court.
times-picayune
examined
market
share
and
it
was
held
there
that
40%
was
not
a
dominant
position
when
the
other
two
sellers
each
had
30%
of
the
relevant
market.
now,
in
northern
pacific,
the
court
found
substantial
economic
power
the
tying
land
on
a
combination
effective
specifically
the
extensive
landholdings
of
the
defendant
there.
secondly,
the
strategic
location
of
the
land.
third,
the
land
was
frequently
essential
to
the
businesses
of
the
buyers
and
lessees
who
were
subjected
to
the
tying
conditions.
fourth,
the
host
of
tying
arrangements
affected
by
the
defendant
without
any
reasonable
explanation
for
the
existence
of
the
restraint.
and
finally,
this
court
concluded
that
the
defendants'
purpose
there
obviously
was
to
fence
out
competitors
and
the
nature
of
the
tie
was
that
the
fencing
out
would
be
for
an
indefinite
period
of
time.
it
was
the
sale
of
land
where
the
covenant
running
with
the
land
indefinite
leases
of
long
terms.
now,
concededly
there
may
be
cases
where
economic
power
over
the
tying
element
can
be
inferred
indirectly
from
proof
that
the
buyers
were
economically
coerced
to
accept
knowingly
an
inferior
burdensome
or
noncompetitive
tied
product.
but
pointing
back
to
the
facts
or
the
absence
of
facts
that
i've
tried
to
bring
to
the
court's
attention
a
moment
ago,
here
in
this
case,
there
is
no
evidence
that
the
plaintiff
consider
the
defendants'
houses
the
tied
product
to
be
of
this
character
when
it
negotiated
the
arrangements
now
challenged,
consequently
we
urged
this
is
not
a
case
of
economic
coercion.
mr.
macdonald
flinn
well,
mr.
justice,
i
would
--
mr.
macdonald
flinn
mr.
justice,
i
think
perhaps
you
and
i
differ
with
all
due
respect
somewhat
in
our
somatic
use
of
the
phrase
“economic
coercion.”
i
am
using
economic
coercion
in
the
sense
of
mr.
justice
harlan's
dissenting
opinion
in
the
northern
pacific
case.
economic
coercion
in
a
tie-in
context
where
at
fair
inference
of
economic
power
over
the
time
element
can
be
drawn
from
the
fact
that
it
is
obvious
from
the
arrangement,
that
the
buyer
has
had
force
upon
him
something
that
he
either
cannot
use,
doesn't
want,
or
is
noncompetitive
and
therefore
--
mr.
macdonald
flinn
my
point
mr.
justice
is,
he
never
made
that
contention
until
months
after
the
arrangement
had
been
entered
into
until
months
after
he
had
come
back
for
a
second
helping
of
more
of
the
same
kind
of
financing.
so,
his
frame
of
mind
which
i
believe
--
mr.
macdonald
flinn
no
sir,
it
is
not.
mr.
macdonald
flinn
it
is
a
an
assertion
if
your
honor
will
that
one
element
which
may
have
to
be
looked
at
in
reaching
a
conclusion
as
to
economic
power
over
the
tying
element
is,
what
was
the
state
of
mind
--
mr.
macdonald
flinn
--
of
the
buyer
at
the
time
he
entered
into.
mr.
macdonald
flinn
no,
my
--
mr.
macdonald
flinn
my
argument
--
my
argument
mr.
justice
is
that
the
economic
coercion,
if
it
arises
as
in
the
tying
case
exists
at
the
time
the
parties
effectuate
the
arrangements
between
them.
it
is
only
in
terms
of
the
buyer's
state
of
mind
at
that
time
that
you
can
ascertain
whether
or
not
there
was
economic
coercion.
now,
to
go
on
with
your
question,
it
seems
to
me
that
if
your
question
fairly
states
the
plaintiff's
position
that
he
could
not
have
gotten
into
the
building
business
through
any
other
financing
media
but
for
the
more
favorable
terms
obtained
from
the
defendants,
then
the
case
is
dispose
off
automatically
without
getting
into
the
question
of
sufficient
economic
power.
it
follows
that
there
was
no
foreclosure
of
competition.
this
plaintiff
would
have
been
unable
to
buy
any
competitor's
prefabricated
houses,
any
competitor's
conventional
house
building
materials.
now,
we
fully
recognized
that
this
court
approaches
tying
arrangements
quite
properly
so
with
suspicion.
indeed,
the
court
has
repeatedly
said
that
they
serve
hardly
any
purpose
beyond
discretion
of
competition.
at
the
same
time,
even
under
the
more
easily
established
standards
of
section
3
of
clayton
act
that
court
has
recognized
the
tying
arrangements
are
not
inevitably
anticompetitive.
and
without
going
into
the
details
we
respectfully
refer
the
court
to
the
sinclair
refining
case
which
is
cited
at
some
detail
in
our
brief.
we
urge
that
where
a
tying
product
is
claimed
to
be
unique
solely
because
it
is
offered
at
a
lower
price
or
on
more
favorable
terms,
it
cannot
logically
be
inferred
from
that
fact
standing
alone
that
there
is
a
sufficient
economic
power
over
the
tying
element
to
constitute
a
per
se
violation.
i
would
ask
the
court
to
consider
the
following
few
examples.
a
buyer
may
take
a
tied
product
as
the
condition
of
paying
a
lower
price
for
the
tying
product,
simply
because
he
considers
the
package
to
offer
the
best
available
terms
for
the
combination
of
products
he
wants
not
because
the
seller
has
economic
power
over
the
tying
element
or
because
the
buyer
is
coerce
to
take
a
tied
product
that
he
does
not
want.
indeed,
the
fact
that
the
tying
product
must
be
offered
on
more
favorable
terms,
may
suggest
that
it
lacks
even
competitive
parity
in
part
of
the
tying
product.
further,
even
a
seller
with
no
economic
power
may
use
a
tying
product
is
a
lost
leader
to
promote
the
sale
of
the
tied
product
by
selling
the
tying
product
at
a
loss,
in
effect
he
reduces
the
prices
of
the
tied
product
that
he
is
selling.
now,
we
respectfully
submit
that
in
northern
pacific,
this
court
appears
to
have
recognized
that
offering
the
tying
product
on
more
favorable
terms
may
imply
the
absence
of
economic
power.
specifically,
the
majority
opinion
there
appears
to
have
given
weight
to
the
fact
that
that
the
defendant
there
made
no
claim
that
the
tying
land
came
any
cheaper
than
if
the
tying
condition
had
not
been
imposed.
finally,
my
time
is
about
to
expire,
we
ask
the
court
to
consider
the
particular
nature,
the
tying
element
involved
here,
financing,
a
commitment
to
lend
money
credit.
if
this
case
has
any
significance
for
others
than
the
parties
to
it,
it
is
most
likely
in
connection
with
this
respect,
with
this
aspect
of
the
case.
dealer,
financing
by
sellers
upon
the
condition
of
the
seller's
goods
be
purchased
is
widespread
in
the
business
community.
indeed,
we
argue
that
it
is
inevitable
because
every
sale
on
credit
involves
a
tie-in,
financing
by
the
seller
upon
the
condition
that
the
buyer
purchase
the
seller's
goods,
unless
the
seller
either
increases
his
price
for
his
goods
or
recovers
in
the
form
of
interest
the
full
cost
of
his
foregoing
prompt
receded
the
funds,
he
has
reduced
the
price
of
his
goods.
if
the
seller
offers
credit
or
financing
on
more
favorable
terms
than
available
elsewhere,
to
that
extent,
he
has
also
reduced
the
price
of
his
goods.
we
submit
that
such
financing,
unique
because
offered
on
more
favorable
terms
than
available
elsewhere
is
price
competition
in
the
goods
sold.
as
such,
the
financing
challenge
by
the
plaintiff
here
was
an
integral
element
of
the
price
of
the
defendants'
prefabricated
houses.
for
all
of
these
reasons,
we
submit
the
judgment
below
should
be
affirmed.
if
the
court
has
no
further
question,
i
shall
conclude
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
macdonald
flinn
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
subject
to
the
wishes
of
the
court
i
planned
that
the
bulk
of
my
argument
today
to
what
conceive
to
be
the
central
legal
issue
in
this
case,
that
issue
turns
upon
the
first
of
the
two
elements
requisite
the
proof
of
a
sherman
act
per
se
time
violation.
specifically
the
question
raised
is
this,
if
the
court
drawing
every
reasonable
inference
in
favor
of
the
plaintiff
concludes
that
the
evidence
shows
that
defendants
financing
of
the
plaintiffs
was
one
more
favorable
terms
that
are
available
from
any
other
source,
there's
that
fact
standing
by
itself
established
the
requisite
sufficient
economic
power
over
the
tying
element
to
appreciably
restrain
trade
in
the
tied
product,
here
prefabricated
homes.
first,
i
would
like
to
touch
briefly
upon
the
facts
and
two
subsidiary
issues.
the
plaintiff
has
argued
that
summary
judgment
was
inappropriate
but
discovery
was
full
and
complete.
to
my
knowledge
there
was
never
any
claim
by
plaintiff
that
additional
facts
needed
to
be
put
in
the
record,
there
was
never
any
request
when
the
defendant
summary
judgment
motion
was
filed
for
additional
time
to
prepare
affidavits
or
otherwise
come
forward
with
the
showing
that
rule
56
(e)
requires
that
there
is
evidence
on
material
facts
in
dispute.
in
addition,
the
plaintiff
has
advised
this
court
as
it
did
the
courts
below
that
all
of
the
evidence
essential
to
its
case
is
in
the
record
now
before
the
court.
on
that
record
--
mr.
macdonald
flinn
mr.
justice
we
urge
this
court
to
draw
its
own
inferences
and
i
am
sure
that
the
court
will
draw
those
inferences
fully
in
favor
of
the
plaintiff.
we
recognize
that
that
is
the
burden
upon
us,
we
welcome
it.
mr.
macdonald
flinn
sherman
act,
sir.
mr.
macdonald
flinn
mr.
justice
there
was
per
curiam
affirmance
by
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
macdonald
flinn
i
believe
that
as
a
fair
interpretation.
mr.
macdonald
flinn
very
well,
your
honor
and
i
would
say
before
attempting
to
answer
to
this
question
we
do
urge
that
regardless
of
the
basis
for
the
district
court's
decision
in
reliance
upon
helvering
and
gowran
on
the
unbroken
line
of
precedence.
in
a
summary
judgment
situation
such
as
urged
here
where
only
questions
of
law
are
presented
to
the
reviewing
court
both
the
court
of
appeals
and
this
court,
whether
or
not
the
grounds
stated
by
the
district
court
were
right
or
leave
out
or
ambiguous,
this
court
is
as
fully
able
as
the
district
court
was
to
reach
the
purely
legal
conclusions
that
are
necessary
in
these
circumstances.
in
essence,
i
think
the
one
aspect
to
the
district
court
decision
which
plaintiff
has
most
frequently
pointed
to
as
suggesting
that
there
was
a
misconception
on
the
part
of
the
district
judge
as
to
what
was
requisite
to
establish
a
cause
of
action
for
per
se
time
violation
under
section
1
whether
embellished
or
not
by
a
section
2
conspiracy
to
monopolize
charge
was
the
district
court's
reference
to
the
amount
of
land
that
was
affected
by
the
arrangement
between
these
parties
in
comparison
with
the
total
land
that
was
available
in
louisville,
kentucky
for
house
developed.
i
would
urge
that
clearly
that
market
fact
by
itself
should
not
be
determinative
in
a
per
se
time
situation.
i
would
urge
equally
strongly
however,
that
the
fact
is
clearly
not
irrelevant
to
the
facts
of
the
these
cases
where
the
tying
arrangement
is
one
between
if
you
will
a
raw
material
supplier
and
his
dealer,
a
middleman
who
is
taking
the
houses
and
then
making
them
available
to
the
ultimate
consumers,
the
house
residents.
i
submit
that
in
terms
of
a
full
analysis
of
this
kind
of
tying
arrangement
it
is
a
appropriate
to
look
to
the
question
where
other
prefabricated
house
manufacturers
were
the
sellers
of
conventional
house
building
materials
and
any
significantly
way
excluded
from
the
market
whether
it's
confined
to
louisville,
kentucky
or
more
broadly.
now,
if
i
may
try
to
articulate
our
position,
so
that
the
court
understands
clearly
why
we
urge
that
summary
adjustment
judgment
is
appropriate
on
this
case,
i
will
proceed.
mr.
macdonald
flinn
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
macdonald
flinn
i
would
urge
not,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
macdonald
flinn
in
now
way.
now
--
mr.
macdonald
flinn
i'm
going
to
urge
mr.
chief
justice
that
the
monopolization
theory
as
i
understand
it
to
be
stated
in
the
petition
and
the
plaintiff's
main
brief
before
this
court
is
not
properly
before
this
court.
mr.
macdonald
flinn
i
am
going
to
argue
very
--
i
am
going
to
argue
very
simply
and
succinctly
mr.
chief
justice
that
this
record
is
barren
of
the
requisite
evidence
to
evidence
to
establish
the
elements
of
a
conspiracy
to
monopolize
specific
intent
the
relevant
market
in
this
as
mr.
justice
brennan
suggested.
i
believe
that
your
decision
in
walker
process,
three
terms
ago,
indicates
that
in
attempt
our
conspiracy
to
monopolize
the
relevant
market
is
an
issue.
as
i
believe
mr.
justice
brennan's
question
suggest
correctly
there
would
be
a
most
substantial
case
of
question
in
this
case
as
to
whether
the
market
can
be
limited
to
prefabricated
houses
or
whether
the
element
of
cross-elasticity
of
demand
does
not
bring
conventional
houses
into
the
market.
now,
on
that
in
essence
is
my
argument
under
conspiracy
to
monopolize
a
part
from
my
principal
argument
that
the
kind
of
conspiracy
to
monopolize
which
i
understand
the
plaintiff
to
be
urging
now
was
never
urged
before
either
the
district
court
or
the
court
of
appeals.
now,
back
to
the
summary
judgment
if
i
may,
we
urge
the
court
and
we
know
that
it
will
and
should
reach
its
own
determination
as
to
what
the
reasonable
inferences
to
be
drawn
from
this
record
are.
we
submit
that
plaintiff
has
not
shown
any
fact
material
to
its
antitrust
claim
to
be
in
dispute
to
require
resolution
by
a
jury
whether
in
terms
of
witness
credibility,
conflicting
evidence
or
otherwise.
in
fact,
the
plaintiff
has
claimed
continuously
indeed
in
his
main
brief
to
this
court
that
on
this
record
it
is
entitled
to
a
directed
verdict.
now,
in
those
circumstances
i
submit
that
there
can
be
no
question
but
that
summary
judgment
is
appropriate
that
the
question
is
what
--
mr.
macdonald
flinn
financing,
yes
sir.
mr.
macdonald
flinn
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
macdonald
flinn
i
believe
that
is
right.
mr.
macdonald
flinn
if
there
were
any
disputed
issues
in
fact,
yes
mr.
justice.
mr.
macdonald
flinn
now--
mr.
macdonald
flinn
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
macdonald
flinn
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
if
i
may
very
briefly
return
to
and
disposed
of
my
argument
in
connection
with
this
summary
judgment
question,
i
would
like
to
briefly
state
some
consideration
which
i
hope
will
assist
the
court
and
in
any
event
make
clear
the
defendants'
position.
at
most,
we
have
differed
with
the
plaintiff
only
as
to
some
of
it's
characterizations
of
the
evidence.
in
our
brief,
we
have
tried
to
set
forth
the
evidence
of
records
cited
by
the
plaintiff
essentially
verbatim
from
the
record
and
have
compared
it
with
a
certain
characterizations
by
the
plaintiff.
i
think
that
clearly
the
most
perhaps
the
only
significant
area
where
we
differ
with
the
plaintiff's
characterizations
is
in
connection
with
the
evidence
relied
upon
by
the
plaintiff
to
establish
it's
claim
that
the
defendants'
financing
extended
to
the
plaintiffs
was
on
more
favorable
terms
than
available
from
any
other
source
including
our
competitors,
other
prefabricated
manufacturers.
but
in
the
final
analysis
that
the
determination
is
for
the
court
and
for
the
court
alone,
and
we
expect
the
court
to
draw
every
reasonable
inference
in
favor
of
the
plaintiff
and
if
the
in
--
mr.
macdonald
flinn
mr.
justice
white,
i
would
answer
--
mr.
macdonald
flinn
mr.
justice,
i
would
answer
that
question
by
saying
that
i
think
upon
the
plaintiff's
own
characterization
of
the
record,
i.e.
that
it
is
a
record
that
entitles
it
to
directed
verdict.
it
is
quite
possible
that
after
a
trial
with
the
jury
sitting
and
hearing
the
evidence
there
would
have
been
no
submission
to
the
jury
that
the
court
would
have
directed
the
verdict
--
mr.
macdonald
flinn
yes,
sir.
i'm
prepared
to
say
that.
on
this
record
--
mr.
macdonald
flinn
i
do
say
it,
mr.
justice.
mr.
macdonald
flinn
that
in
essence
is
my
argument
mr.
justice
because
we
are
prepared
to
accept
any
inferences
that
the
plaintiffs
can
reasonably
argue
from
this
record.
and
they
have
told
us,
they
have
to
the
court
that
the
record
is
complete.
and
indeed
today,
i
believe
the
plaintiff's
counsel
has
advised
the
court
that
at
most
any
other
evidence
that
he
would
have
put
on
would
have
been
cumulative
of
what
is
now
in
this
record
before
the
court.
now,
for
the
balance
of
my
argument,
i
shall
assume
arguendo
that
the
plaintiff's
claim
that
the
defendants'
financing
was
extended
on
a
more
favorable
terms
than
available
elsewhere
is
the
fair
inference
and
in
the
inference
that
this
court
will
draw
because
as
i
am
find
to
make
clear
we
in
no
way
dispute
the
evidence
and
we
will
accept
whatever
the
court
concludes
are
the
reasonable
inferences
from
that
evidence.
i
would
like
to
point
only
to
one
aspect
of
this
record
and
ask
the
court
particularly
to
notice,
nowhere
is
there
any
evidence
that
the
plaintiff
objected
the
defendants'
houses
or
in
any
way
found
the
burdensome
or
noncompetitive
at
the
time
these
arrangements
were
negotiated
and
entered
into.
similarly,
there
is
no
evidence
that
the
plaintiff
would
have
bought
houses
or
building
materials
from
any
other
source
absent
to
financing
that
was
made
available
to
it
by
the
defendants.
mr.
macdonald
flinn
i
am
assuming
mr.
justice
that
the
loan
was
offered,
the
commitment
was
made
on
more
favorable
terms
than
were
available
elsewhere
to
this
plaintiff.
mr.
macdonald
flinn
i
will
argue
that
that
is
not
uniqueness
within
the
sense
of
the
per
se
doctrines
spelled
out
in
loew's
case.
mr.
macdonald
flinn
exactly.
exactly,
it
does
not
permit
such
an
inference
mr.
justice.
mr.
macdonald
flinn
that
would
be
a
second
prong
to
my
argument.
i
think
very
honestly
mr.
justice,
the
more
significant
argument
is
that,
the
claim,
that
a
tying
element
involves
sufficient
the
economic
power
appreciably
the
restrain
commerce
--
mr.
macdonald
flinn
definitely.
mr.
macdonald
flinn
clearly
mr.
justice,
i
must
face
up
to
that
case.
now
to
dispose
of
what
i
believe
is
the
last
subsidiary
issue.
this
question
of
the
conspiracy
to
monopolize,
our
position
is
very
simple.
we
admit
that
the
plaintiff
has
always
alleged
and
argued
a
conspiracy
to
monopolize
in
violation
of
section
2.
the
point
we
make
is
very
simple.
before
both
courts
below
and
indeed
we
think
on
a
fair
reading
of
the
plaintiff's
brief
before
this
court,
it
has
always
urged
that
that
conspiracy
indeed
its
entire
case
turned
upon
the
existence
of
a
per
se
time
violation
either
as
the
objective
or
the
means
of
affecting
the
violation
of
both
sections
1
and
2
to
the
extent
that
the
plaintiff's
brief
and
i
am
still
uncertain
after
listening
to
counsel's
argument
today
but
to
the
extent
that
plaintiff's
brief
argues
before
this
court
that
its
conspiracy
to
monopolize
does
not
turned
upon,
does
not
require
proof
of
a
per
se
time
violation.
that
is
an
argument
that
was
never
presented
to
the
courts
below.
now,
turning
to
this
--
mr.
macdonald
flinn
mr.
justice,
my
idea
of
loew's
is
that
honestly,
i
don't
know
exactly
what
the
court
meant
when
it
use
the
term
unique
there.
i
would
like
to
discuss
that
case
in
considerable
detail
as
well
as
its
place
against
the
background
of
all
these
courts
significant
time
rule
cases.
now,
let's
again
come
back
to
the
basic
--
mr.
macdonald
flinn
no
question
about
that
mr.
justice,
if
i
can
give
any
assistance
that
would
be
the
only
reason
from
my
offering
argument.
to
come
to
back
to
the
central
contention
by
the
plaintiff,
it's
very
simple.
it
claims
that
because
the
financing
extended
by
defendant
require
the
plaintiff
to
place
no
equity
into
the
land
portion
of
the
loan
commitment
which
was
something
else
than
15%
of
the
total
commitment
extended
by
the
defendants.
this
was
more
favorable
and
available
from
any
other
source
and
therefore
within
the
meaning
of
the
loew's
case
was
unique
and
consequently
establishes
the
requisite
sufficient
economic
power
over
the
tying
element.
our
contention
very
simply
is
that
as
a
matter
of
logic
supported
by
the
decision
of
this
court,
you
cannot
infer
simply
from
the
fact
that
the
time
element
is
offered
on
more
favorable
terms
than
available
elsewhere
that
there
is
economic
power
in
that
tying
element.
now
coming
mr.
justice
white
to
the
loew's
decision,
as
this
court
well
knows
it
involved
the
block-booking
of
copyrighted
movie
films.
it
held
that
the
requisite
economic
power
over
the
time
element,
it
presumed
when
the
tying
element
is
either
patented
or
copyrighted.
moreover,
as
the
court
well
knows,
the
tied
products
there
were
frequently
forced
upon
unwilling
purchases.
now,
outside
the
patent
and
copyright
areas,
i
urged
that
the
court
has
not
defined
uniqueness
and
i
concede
my
inability
to
tell
this
court
what
it
meant
when
it
use
the
term
unique
in
the
loew's
case.
i
would
urge
however
that
to
the
extent
that
it
coupled
with
that
a
reference
to
desirability
to
consumers,
i
think
that
this
must
as
a
matter
of
common
sense
than
intended
by
the
court
to
mean
something
more
than
desirable
in
the
sense
that
one
consumer
buys
10
cents
worth
of
a
tying
element.
that
would
establish
sufficient
economic
power
and
practically
every
product
is
sold.
i
think
the
court
meant
something
in
terms
of
some
in
addition
of
meaningful
economic
power.
indeed,
the
court
has
never
merely
assumed
the
existence
of
economic
power
and
i
would
point
to
the
other
significant
tying
decisions
of
the
court.
times-picayune
examined
market
share
and
it
was
held
there
that
40%
was
not
a
dominant
position
when
the
other
two
sellers
each
had
30%
of
the
relevant
market.
now,
in
northern
pacific,
the
court
found
substantial
economic
power
the
tying
land
on
a
combination
effective
specifically
the
extensive
landholdings
of
the
defendant
there.
secondly,
the
strategic
location
of
the
land.
third,
the
land
was
frequently
essential
to
the
businesses
of
the
buyers
and
lessees
who
were
subjected
to
the
tying
conditions.
fourth,
the
host
of
tying
arrangements
affected
by
the
defendant
without
any
reasonable
explanation
for
the
existence
of
the
restraint.
and
finally,
this
court
concluded
that
the
defendants'
purpose
there
obviously
was
to
fence
out
competitors
and
the
nature
of
the
tie
was
that
the
fencing
out
would
be
for
an
indefinite
period
of
time.
it
was
the
sale
of
land
where
the
covenant
running
with
the
land
indefinite
leases
of
long
terms.
now,
concededly
there
may
be
cases
where
economic
power
over
the
tying
element
can
be
inferred
indirectly
from
proof
that
the
buyers
were
economically
coerced
to
accept
knowingly
an
inferior
burdensome
or
noncompetitive
tied
product.
but
pointing
back
to
the
facts
or
the
absence
of
facts
that
i've
tried
to
bring
to
the
court's
attention
a
moment
ago,
here
in
this
case,
there
is
no
evidence
that
the
plaintiff
consider
the
defendants'
houses
the
tied
product
to
be
of
this
character
when
it
negotiated
the
arrangements
now
challenged,
consequently
we
urged
this
is
not
a
case
of
economic
coercion.
mr.
macdonald
flinn
well,
mr.
justice,
i
would
--
mr.
macdonald
flinn
mr.
justice,
i
think
perhaps
you
and
i
differ
with
all
due
respect
somewhat
in
our
somatic
use
of
the
phrase
“economic
coercion.”
i
am
using
economic
coercion
in
the
sense
of
mr.
justice
harlan's
dissenting
opinion
in
the
northern
pacific
case.
economic
coercion
in
a
tie-in
context
where
at
fair
inference
of
economic
power
over
the
time
element
can
be
drawn
from
the
fact
that
it
is
obvious
from
the
arrangement,
that
the
buyer
has
had
force
upon
him
something
that
he
either
cannot
use,
doesn't
want,
or
is
noncompetitive
and
therefore
--
mr.
macdonald
flinn
my
point
mr.
justice
is,
he
never
made
that
contention
until
months
after
the
arrangement
had
been
entered
into
until
months
after
he
had
come
back
for
a
second
helping
of
more
of
the
same
kind
of
financing.
so,
his
frame
of
mind
which
i
believe
--
mr.
macdonald
flinn
no
sir,
it
is
not.
mr.
macdonald
flinn
it
is
a
an
assertion
if
your
honor
will
that
one
element
which
may
have
to
be
looked
at
in
reaching
a
conclusion
as
to
economic
power
over
the
tying
element
is,
what
was
the
state
of
mind
--
mr.
macdonald
flinn
--
of
the
buyer
at
the
time
he
entered
into.
mr.
macdonald
flinn
no,
my
--
mr.
macdonald
flinn
my
argument
--
my
argument
mr.
justice
is
that
the
economic
coercion,
if
it
arises
as
in
the
tying
case
exists
at
the
time
the
parties
effectuate
the
arrangements
between
them.
it
is
only
in
terms
of
the
buyer's
state
of
mind
at
that
time
that
you
can
ascertain
whether
or
not
there
was
economic
coercion.
now,
to
go
on
with
your
question,
it
seems
to
me
that
if
your
question
fairly
states
the
plaintiff's
position
that
he
could
not
have
gotten
into
the
building
business
through
any
other
financing
media
but
for
the
more
favorable
terms
obtained
from
the
defendants,
then
the
case
is
dispose
off
automatically
without
getting
into
the
question
of
sufficient
economic
power.
it
follows
that
there
was
no
foreclosure
of
competition.
this
plaintiff
would
have
been
unable
to
buy
any
competitor's
prefabricated
houses,
any
competitor's
conventional
house
building
materials.
now,
we
fully
recognized
that
this
court
approaches
tying
arrangements
quite
properly
so
with
suspicion.
indeed,
the
court
has
repeatedly
said
that
they
serve
hardly
any
purpose
beyond
discretion
of
competition.
at
the
same
time,
even
under
the
more
easily
established
standards
of
section
3
of
clayton
act
that
court
has
recognized
the
tying
arrangements
are
not
inevitably
anticompetitive.
and
without
going
into
the
details
we
respectfully
refer
the
court
to
the
sinclair
refining
case
which
is
cited
at
some
detail
in
our
brief.
we
urge
that
where
a
tying
product
is
claimed
to
be
unique
solely
because
it
is
offered
at
a
lower
price
or
on
more
favorable
terms,
it
cannot
logically
be
inferred
from
that
fact
standing
alone
that
there
is
a
sufficient
economic
power
over
the
tying
element
to
constitute
a
per
se
violation.
i
would
ask
the
court
to
consider
the
following
few
examples.
a
buyer
may
take
a
tied
product
as
the
condition
of
paying
a
lower
price
for
the
tying
product,
simply
because
he
considers
the
package
to
offer
the
best
available
terms
for
the
combination
of
products
he
wants
not
because
the
seller
has
economic
power
over
the
tying
element
or
because
the
buyer
is
coerce
to
take
a
tied
product
that
he
does
not
want.
indeed,
the
fact
that
the
tying
product
must
be
offered
on
more
favorable
terms,
may
suggest
that
it
lacks
even
competitive
parity
in
part
of
the
tying
product.
further,
even
a
seller
with
no
economic
power
may
use
a
tying
product
is
a
lost
leader
to
promote
the
sale
of
the
tied
product
by
selling
the
tying
product
at
a
loss,
in
effect
he
reduces
the
prices
of
the
tied
product
that
he
is
selling.
now,
we
respectfully
submit
that
in
northern
pacific,
this
court
appears
to
have
recognized
that
offering
the
tying
product
on
more
favorable
terms
may
imply
the
absence
of
economic
power.
specifically,
the
majority
opinion
there
appears
to
have
given
weight
to
the
fact
that
that
the
defendant
there
made
no
claim
that
the
tying
land
came
any
cheaper
than
if
the
tying
condition
had
not
been
imposed.
finally,
my
time
is
about
to
expire,
we
ask
the
court
to
consider
the
particular
nature,
the
tying
element
involved
here,
financing,
a
commitment
to
lend
money
credit.
if
this
case
has
any
significance
for
others
than
the
parties
to
it,
it
is
most
likely
in
connection
with
this
respect,
with
this
aspect
of
the
case.
dealer,
financing
by
sellers
upon
the
condition
of
the
seller's
goods
be
purchased
is
widespread
in
the
business
community.
indeed,
we
argue
that
it
is
inevitable
because
every
sale
on
credit
involves
a
tie-in,
financing
by
the
seller
upon
the
condition
that
the
buyer
purchase
the
seller's
goods,
unless
the
seller
either
increases
his
price
for
his
goods
or
recovers
in
the
form
of
interest
the
full
cost
of
his
foregoing
prompt
receded
the
funds,
he
has
reduced
the
price
of
his
goods.
if
the
seller
offers
credit
or
financing
on
more
favorable
terms
than
available
elsewhere,
to
that
extent,
he
has
also
reduced
the
price
of
his
goods.
we
submit
that
such
financing,
unique
because
offered
on
more
favorable
terms
than
available
elsewhere
is
price
competition
in
the
goods
sold.
as
such,
the
financing
challenge
by
the
plaintiff
here
was
an
integral
element
of
the
price
of
the
defendants'
prefabricated
houses.
for
all
of
these
reasons,
we
submit
the
judgment
below
should
be
affirmed.
if
the
court
has
no
further
question,
i
shall
conclude
mr.
chief
justice.
