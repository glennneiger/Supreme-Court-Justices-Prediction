justice
abe
fortas
well
the
tie-in
cases
are
section
1
cases,
aren't
they?
justice
abe
fortas
they're
not,
they're
not
monopolization.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
the
section
1
violation,
what
provisions
would
you
have
other
than
what
is
in
the
record
already?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
wonder
if
the
issue
before
us
can
be
stated
this
way,
the
--
i
supposed
incontestably
there
were
other
sources
available
for
funds
by
way
of
loan
in
the
area.
there
were
other
sources
available
from
which
you
could
obtain
loans
according
to
the
opinion
of
the
court
below
there
were
great
many
said
sources.
but
you're
point
is
that
it
was
only
from
the
defendant
here,
the
u.s.
steels
lending
corporation
or
financial
corporation
or
whatever
it
is
that
fortner
enterprises
could
obtain
loans
on
terms
and
conditions
that
were
economically
possible
for
the
company.
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
the
narrow
issue
we
have
is
whether
the
requirement
in
northern
pacific
and
other
tie-in
cases
of
an
appreciable
effect
on
the
market
whether
the
tie-in
has
an
appreciable
effect
on
market
or
ties
up
their
requisite
portion
of
the
market
is
satisfied
by
that
kind
of
a
showing
satisfied
so
clearly
and
completely
as
to
justify
a
summary
judgment
against
you.
is
that
about
the
issue
before
us?
justice
abe
fortas
i
know
that.
yes,
that's
what
i
--
i
tried
to
say
that
as
to
justify
the
entry
of
summary
judgment.
we're
sitting
as
an
the
appellate
court
and
the
question
is
whether
the
lower
court
did
or
did
not
err
in
entering
the
summary
judgment
against
you
on
the
basis
of
a
record
which
you
say
was
not
complete
for
the
record
which
nevertheless
established
that
the
exclusion
or
the
preemption
that
if
it
occurred
hereby
reason
of
the
tie-in
was
not
a
preemption
of
the
total
financial
market
but
only
a
preemption
of
that
portion
of
the
financial
market
which
was
available
to
you
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
loans
on
this
peculiarly
advantageous
conditions.
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
trying
not
to
state
this
invidiously
so
far
as
either
side
is
concerned
but
it
seems
to
me
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
perhaps
that's
the
issue.
justice
abe
fortas
you
know,
all
i'm
asking
is
whether
--
is
the
dispositive
issue
of
fact
that
is
before
us,
the
question
whether
or
well
it's
the
dispositive
issue
of
law
before
us
depends
upon
whether
we
believe
that
you
can
establish
your
case
by
showing
merely
this
qualified
partial
preemption
of
the
market
that
i
have
described.
that
is
to
say
preemption
of
the
market
of
funds,
of
available
funds,
of
funds
available
to
your
needs
particularly
favorable
terms.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
you
could
have
gone
elsewhere
and
obtained
the
loan
on
--
but
not
on
such
available
conditions,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
you
could
have
gone
elsewhere
and
obtained
the
prefabricated
houses
or
could
have
built
conventional
houses,
is
that
correct?
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
so
well,
it's
the
question
of
the
putting
to
get
--
whether
the
putting
together
of
this
constituted
an
unreasonable
restraint
of
trade
under
section
1?
justice
abe
fortas
or
satisfy
the
perhaps
stricter
standards
of
our
tie-in
cases,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
and
the
issue
then
is
whether
there
was
here
the
kind
of
market
preemption
or
foreclosure
of
loan
firms
available
on
these
peculiarly
advantageous
terms
whether
that
kind
of
preemption
of
foreclosure
constitutes
a
violation
of
section
1
when
it
was
coupled
with
the
tie-in
arrangement
for
the
prefabricated
houses.
am
i
getting
closer
to
the
target
now?
justice
abe
fortas
but
the
court
below
held
that
funds
were
available
to
you
elsewhere
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
except
that
they
were
not
available
on
these
terms
and
conditions?
justice
abe
fortas
so
the
narrow
question
is
whether
the
foreclosure
of
the
availability
of
funds
on
this
especially
favorable
terms
and
conditions
satisfies
the
requirements
of
our
tie-in
cases.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
however
then
may
be
to
establish
the
plaintiff's
cases,
he's
got
to
show
according
to
our
cases.
monopoly
power
or
at
least
to
very
higher
degree
of
economic
control
on
the
market
for
the
tie-in
service,
the
tie-in
factor
here
being
the
loan.
justice
abe
fortas
and
he's
got
to
show
that
the
tie-in
results
in
a
substantial
restraint
upon
the
competition
in
the
market.
for
the
tied
article
that
the
tied
article
being
the
prefabricated
house.
right?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
as
i
read
the
opinion
of
the
court
below
and
perhaps
i'm
wrong,
the
court
below
said
that
he
had
not
shown
either
of
those,
is
that
right
or
wrong?
justice
abe
fortas
and
the
question
is
whether
that
conclusion
made
the
case
appropriate
for
summary
judgment
or
whether
the
plaintiff
was
entitled
to
submit
the
disputed
questions
of
the
fact
to
a
jury
and
the
jury
decide
on
those
elements
and
that's
right?
justice
abe
fortas
alright.
justice
abe
fortas
well
the
tie-in
cases
are
section
1
cases,
aren't
they?
justice
abe
fortas
they're
not,
they're
not
monopolization.
justice
