unknown
speaker
what
element?
unknown
speaker
what
are
the
objects
you
say
they
forced
you
to
buy
to
tie-in?
unknown
speaker
forced
you
to
buy
the
prefabricated
housing
in
order
to
get
the
loan?
unknown
speaker
and
that's
your
--
that's
the
argument
you
have?
unknown
speaker
do
you
now
(inaudible)?
unknown
speaker
did
you
bring
the
clayton
act
in
this
at
all?
unknown
speaker
incidentally,
what's
the
trade
restraint
here,
its
houses,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
what
kind
of
house?
unknown
speaker
that's
all.
just
prefabricated?
unknown
speaker
yes,
i'm
familiar
--
i
was
interested
precisely
what
the
market
was
that
you
said
that
was
strange
here
by
this
practice?
unknown
speaker
on
your
theories?
unknown
speaker
doesn't
there
have
to
be
a
restraint
of
trade
here
in
the
housing
work?
unknown
speaker
or
in
the
prefabricated
part?
unknown
speaker
and
the
restraint
amounts
to
preempting
some
57
acres
of
land,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
but
there
is
--
this
is
the
only
land
that
--
this
is
the
only
land
that
these
particular
contracts
at
which
your
client
entered
into
effect.
unknown
speaker
exactly.
exactly,
yes.
unknown
speaker
incidentally,
you've
said
a
while
ago
that
you
could
not
have
paid
off
this
loan.
unknown
speaker
i
mean
that
you
are
--
that
the
lender
--
unknown
speaker
but
the
lender
refused,
do
you
have
permission
to
pay
off
the
loan?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
the
district
court
said
that
any
time
plaintiff
could
have
liquidated
the
debt
to
defendant,
credit
corporation
be
relieved
from
all
obligations
to
it
including
the
restriction
on
the
55
record.
unknown
speaker
what
you
want
is
to
be
free
from
insofar
by
prefabricated
houses
to
put
up
on
these
lands?
unknown
speaker
and
here,
borrow
the
money
on
the
favor
of
return?
unknown
speaker
that's
your
question?
unknown
speaker
you
say
they
were
engaged
--
you
say
they
were
engaged
in
a
lending
business
in
the
way
it
would
affect
the
interstate
commerce?
unknown
speaker
they
agreed
to
lend
but
they
imposed
on
you
in
turn
of
having
to
get
prefabricated
houses
in
order
to
have
the
loan?
unknown
speaker
is
that
your
holding?
unknown
speaker
is
that
the
entire
issue?
unknown
speaker
you
claim
that
you
were
denied
the
opportunity
to
present
evidence,
to
show
which
factor?
unknown
speaker
did
he
--
did
the
court
tried
to
issue
himself?
unknown
speaker
was
it
getting
a
trial
before
the
jury?
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that.
unknown
speaker
(voice
overlap)
some
issues.
unknown
speaker
two
claims
that
were
done
by
the
jury?
unknown
speaker
and
that
they
are
--
there
were
disputed
questions?
unknown
speaker
they
decided
among
the
affidavit
matters?
unknown
speaker
(voice
overlap)
the
court's
decision
was
that
(inaudible)
there
is
no
dispute,
as
a
matter
of
law
(inaudible)?
unknown
speaker
if
you
assume,
i
guess
your
argument
--
if
you
assume
that
favorable
term
using
were
designed
using
gauge
in
the
business
in
fact
it
come,
he
had
no
power
or
the
judge
has
no
power
or
right
to
determine
that
issue.
those
issues
of
facts
that
he
has
without
you
being
allowed
to
introduce
more
and
you
did
not
as
i
understand
it
as
that.
now
you
assert
that
that
could
have
been
effective
which
would
have
shown
that
you
are
entitled
to
recover?
unknown
speaker
how
do
you
make
findings
of
fact
if
they
were
not
essential
in
judgment?
unknown
speaker
but
it
was
essential.
unknown
speaker
the
findings
of
facts?
unknown
speaker
but
if
he
was
--
if
he
is
going
to
be
arested
on
the
facts
as
to
what
the
facts
were,
i
guess
they
have
to
be
found
that
these
were
the
facts.
unknown
speaker
are
you
claiming
those
facts
of
the
inferences
found
should
have
been
drawn
by
a
jury
and
not
by
the
(voice
overlap)?
unknown
speaker
i
gather
that
they
aren't
given
inferences
shown
by
the
court
from
that
were
not
enough.
unknown
speaker
further,
there
are
conflicts
of
fact
here.
there
are
conflicts
of
judgment
as
to
market
i
suppose
but
the
question
--
the
issue
may
be
whether
assuming
all
of
the
facts
to
be
as
the
plaintiff
urges
them
to
be
was
most
ambitious
statement
of
the
fact
if
you
will.
making
that
assumption
does
has
a
plaintiff
stated
a
cause
of
action
that
would
entitle
him
to
recover
under
section
1
of
the
clayton
act?
unknown
speaker
of
the
sherman
act,
i
mean
and
i
take
it
from
reading
the
opinion
of
the
district
court
that
which
was
adopted
as
i
remember
by
the
court
of
appeals,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
yeah.
alright.
that
the
reading
of
opinion
of
the
district
court
i
take
it
that
the
district
court
concluded
that
making
that
assumption,
everything
the
plaintiff
contends
for
to
be
established
still
does
not
constitute
as
a
manner
of
law
violation
of
section
1.
unknown
speaker
well,
why
don't
you
tell
us
succinctly
as
you
can
their
reason
for
the
district
court's
legal
conclusion?
unknown
speaker
although
that's
a
the
question
that
we
can
resolve.
unknown
speaker
it's
a
case
of
economic
coercion
with
respect
to
the
tie-in
product
of
financing
if
what
petitioner
represent
is
true
namely
that
it
was
only
by
virtue
of
obtaining
this
loan
on
the
favorable
on
this
uniquely
favorable
terms
that
petitioner
was
able
to
go
ahead
with
its
business
of
constructing
(voice
overlap)
how
time
went
in
--
unknown
speaker
--
constructing
houses.
so
that
in
that
sense
so
as
the
economic
coercion,
question
is
whether
that
was
the
kind
of
economic
coercion
or
the
greater
extent
of
the
economic
coercion
that
satisfies
the
requirements
of
buyer
tie-in
cases.
it
is
not
a
copyrighted
product
that,
perhaps
it
does
not
have
elements
of
uniqueness
in
the
same
sense
of
the
motion
picture
film
has
but
the
petition
argues
that
it
was
essential
to
its
conduct
of
business.
i
suppose,
petitioner
might
say
that
it's
more
like
northern
pacific.
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
precisely
the
submission
here
that
petitioner
says
he
should
have
been
allowed
to
present
jury.
unknown
speaker
so
what
is
that
a
pari
delicto
argument?
unknown
speaker
what
is
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
--
unknown
speaker
well,
that
sounds
like
in
a
statement
on
your
part
that
it
would
be
the
most
regrettable
error
or
mistake
of
judgment
from
the
jury
to
decide
--
unknown
speaker
--
that
this
is
economic
coercion.
but
that
doesn't
get
you
--
unknown
speaker
what
element?
unknown
speaker
what
are
the
objects
you
say
they
forced
you
to
buy
to
tie-in?
unknown
speaker
forced
you
to
buy
the
prefabricated
housing
in
order
to
get
the
loan?
unknown
speaker
and
that's
your
--
that's
the
argument
you
have?
unknown
speaker
do
you
now
(inaudible)?
unknown
speaker
did
you
bring
the
clayton

in

unknown

incidentally,
what's
the
trade

here,
its
houses,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
what

of

unknown
speaker
that's
all.
just
prefabricated?
unknown

yes,
i'm

was

getting

i
understand

(voice

some

two

he

i

they

unknown

i
