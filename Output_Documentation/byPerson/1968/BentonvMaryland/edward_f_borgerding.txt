mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
chief
justice
warren
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
basic
question
in
this
case
is
that
the
petitioner's
selection
to
be
re-indicted
by
declaring
that
his
original
indictment
was
null
and
void
under
schowgurow
and
his
subsequent
conviction
constitutes
double
jeopardy.
it
is
the
state's
position
that
it
does
not
constitute
double
jeopardy
in
this
case.
now,
as
my
brother
has
indicated,
mr.
benton
was
indicted
in
maryland
in
1965
of
the
three
counts,
as
he
had
indicated,
a
common
law
burglary,
housebreaking,
and
the
third
count
was
larceny.
he
was
convicted
of
the
larceny
count
or,
i
mean
--
excuse
me.
he
was
convicted
of
the
burglary
count
by
jury
in
neighboring
prince
george's
county,
and
the
state
abandoned
the
second
count,
and
he
was
found
not
guilty
as
to
the
larceny
count.
he
appealed
to
the
maryland
court
of
appeals
in
september
of
1965.
the
following
month,
maryland
--
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland
handed
down
the
decision
in
schowgurow,
and
so,
this
question
of
double
jeopardy
is
involved
in
the
procedural
set
up,
and
what
did
schowgurow
provide
as
far
as
the
maryland
judicial
system
was
concerned.
schowgurow
held
that
the
provisions
of
article
36
of
the
maryland
declarations
of
rights
requiring
a
belief
in
god
as
a
qualification
for
grand
jury
service
or
petty
jury
service
was
in
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution.
and,
that
was
predicated
because
of
this
court's
decision
in
torcaso,
the
year
or
two
before,
in
which
this
court
held
that
the
maryland
requirement
that
a
public
official
express
a
belief
in
god
under
article
37
was
in
violation.
now,
when
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland
reached
this
decision,
it
was
confronted
with,
and
there's
no
accurate
figures
but,
a
possibly,
in
the
neighborhood
it
was
estimated
around,
3,500
indictments
throughout
the
entire
judicial
system
of
maryland
that
had
been
indicted
by
the
--
an
invalid
grand
jury,
if
you
please.
now
--
so,
therefore,
they
limit
the
retroactivity
of
this
decision,
schowgurow,
to
the
cases
that
had
not
become
final
as
of
the
schowgurow
decision.
now,
in
order
to
implement
and
carryout
this,
and
it
was
a
gigantic
proposition
that
was
confronting
the
judicial
system
of
maryland
at
this
time,
there
were
several
other
cases
that
were
decide
within
three
or
four
days.
one
was
state
versus
madison.
the
question
in
state
versus
madison
was
that
an
accused
--
that
any
accused
that
was
indicted
or
convicted
by
such
an
improperly
constituted
grand
jury
had
the
right
to
have
the
original
indictment
declared
null
and
void
or
his
case
retried
without
showing
actual
prejudice.
and
now,
your
honors,
the
question
there
was,
should
a
member
of
the
so-called
excluded
class
be
entitled
to
raise
this
point
or
was
it
limited
only
to
the
included
class,
to
what
the
persons
that
did
not
believe
in
god?
and,
in
madison,
the
court,
i
think,
went
beyond
this
court
and
held
that
it
applied
to
both
the
excluded
class
and
the
included
class,
so
that
anyone
could
file
and
--
in
a
proper
proceeding
and
set
aside
his
indictment
because
it
was
brought
back
by
an
invalid
constituted
grand
jury,
to
which
a
grand
jury
that
was
in
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
now,
in
order
to
--
and,
also,
you'll
note
in
that
decision
they
held
that
the
individual
did
not
have
to
show
prejudice.
this
was
another
attempt
to
protect
the
rights
of
the
individual.
he
had
no
need
to
show
pric
--
that
he
was
prejudiced
by
this
unconstituted
--
unconstitutional
grand
jury.
then,
to
cover
another
point,
they
had
the
case
of
smith
versus
state.
these
all
happen
within
a
period
of
three
or
four
days,
as
they
implemented
this
decision.
it
was
held
that
there
could
be
an
intelligent
and
knowingly
waiver
of
the
defects
in
an
indictment
or
conviction
by
such
an
improperly
constituted
grand
jury.
this
meant
that
someone,
if
they
saw
fit,
they
could
waive
that
constitutionally
invalid
grand
jury.
then,
in
--
the
fourth
case
that
came
up
at
this
time
was
hayes
versus
wainwright
vers
--
hayes
and
wainwright
versus
state.
the
question
here
was,
did
someone
have
to
raise
this
point
in
the
lower
court
to
have
it
considered
by
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland?
and,
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
it
wasn't
necessary
that
they
raise
the
invalidity
of
the
grand
jury
in
the
lower
court.
they
all
could
have
benefit
of
it.
now,
in
that
framework,
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland
went
forth
and
set
up
guidelines.
they
remanded
approximately
221
cases,
which
is
an
exact
figure
form
their
records,
that
were
pending
in
the
system
in
the
--
before
the
appellate
court.
as
far
as
the
cases
that
were
indicted,
there
were
some
filed
in
the
classification.
they
had
been
indicted,
but
they
had
not
been
tried.
some
have
been
indicted,
had
been
tried,
but
not
--
had
not
taken
an
appeal.
and,
other
ones
would
fall
in
the
category
that
they
had
been
tried
and
they
were
acquitted
and
so,
they
were
out,
as
far
as
this
constitu
--
in
illegally
constituted
grand
jury.
now,
these
are
the
guidelines
that
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland
set
down
in
their
notice
to
the
lower
court.
they
said
that
the
accused
was
to
be
brought
into
the
trial
court
with
his
counsel
present
to
ascertain
whether
he
desires
to
avail
himself
of
the
rif
--
relief
afforded
by
the
ruling,
and/or
whether
he
elects
to
waive
any
objections
now
available
to
him,
under
this
decision,
the
four
that
i've
mentioned.
the
accused
--
second,
the
accused
is
to
be
informed
of
his
right
to
attack
his
conviction
and
of
the
fact
that
the
court
would
vacate
the
indictment
or
a
conviction
if
he
moved
them
to
do
so.
third,
the
accused
is
to
be
advised
that
he
is
subject
to
re-indictment
and
trial
if
he
elects
not
to
abide
by
his
present
status.
four,
the
accused
should
likewise
be
advised
that
if
he'd
be
reconvicted
of
any
new
sentence
to
be
imposed,
any
new
sentence
to
be
imposed
might
be
greater
or
less
than
the
one
or
ones
presently
against
him
within
the
maximum
limits.
five,
the
accused
is
to
be
told
that
he
can
waive
any
defects
in
the
grand
or
petty
jury
which
indicted
or
convicted
him,
notwithstanding
the
unlawful
composition
of
that
jury.
and,
last,
if
the
accused
selects
to
accept
the
indictment
or
trial
jury
as
valid
and
that
--
the
appeal
will
proceed
to
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
usual
way
on
the
grounds
of
bear
change.
now,
mr.
benton
was
brought
into
the
court
in
prince
george's
county.
he
was
advised
of
these
rights
in
the
presence
of
his
counsel
and
he
exercised
his
option
to
declare
his
original
indictment
null
and
void.
now
--
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
your
honor,
i
would
go
to
the
appendix.
it
would
be
in
the
docket
entried.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
it'd
be
on
page
2,
your
honor,
at
where
it
says
“defendant
challenges
the
array
of
the
grand
jury
on
june
30,
1966.”
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
well,
that
is
the
original
motion,
your
honor,
that
mr.
benton
made
in
the
lower
court
against
the
larceny
count.
but
then,
he
has
changed
it
as
he
proceeded
along
the
appellate
route.
he
has
changed
it
now
and
he
raises
the
point
that
he
is
prejudiced
on
the
larceny
count
by
the
mere
fact
--
or
by
the
fact,
i
should
say,
that
he
was
indicted
for
larceny
after
being
acquitted
of
same.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
no,
sir.
our
position
--
the
state's
position
that
this
--
when
mr.
benton
exercised
his
right
to
declare
his
indictment
null
and
void,
the
indictment
is
void
abenitio.
it
was
returned
by
it
illegally
or
unconstituted
--
unconstitutional
com
--
organized
grand
jury
and,
as
such,
since
he
exercised
that
right,
an
unconstitutionally
grand
jury
cannot
bring
back
a
valid
indictment
and,
therefore,
the
court
had
no
jurisdiction
and
he
was
therefore
not
placed
in
jeopardy
on
his
first
trial.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
well,
a
verdict
of
not
guilty
could
be
final
upon
it
being
given,
assuming
that
no
one
has
any
rights
to
appeal
and,
in
maryland,
the
state
does
not
have
the
right
to
--
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
no,
sir.
you're
correct.
he
would
not.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
i
would
say
it
was
final
at
the
day
it
was
rendered,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
well,
we
go
back
to
our
basic
premise
that
the
mere
fact
that
that
first
indictment
was
brought
by
an
unconstitutional
grand
jury,
that
it
did
not
bring
back
a
valid
indictment.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
well,
now,
you
referring,
i
assume
to
the
second
trial.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
so,
we
have
two
trials,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
his
final
--
it
was
final
if
the
indictment
was
valid.
it
was
final
if
the
court
had
jurisdiction
over
that
indictment,
yes.
i
would
agree.
it
would
be
final.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
it
depends
on
what
is
determined
unlawfully
drawn
and
there
are
some
cases
that
say
defective
and
so
forth,
but
i
say
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case
where
the
court
held
that
the
grand
jury
as
--
that
brought
back
this
indictment
was
unconstitutionally
organized.
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
constitution,
that
grand
jury
cannot
bring
a
valid
indictment,
if
that
is
so.
and,
mr.
benton
made
it
so
by
exercising
his
option,
and
he
was
told
that
the
indictment
would
be
null
and
void.
he
had
the
right
to
exercise
the
right
either
to
make
it
null
and
void
or
not.
that's
true,
but
once
he
did,
the
court
had
no
power
to
sent
--
or
no
power
to
try
him
on
the
invalid
indictment.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
yes,
sir?
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
that
is
correct.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
the
--
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
your
honor,
this
was
null
and
void
at
the
discretion
of
the
defendant.
it
was
up
to
him
to
declare
whether
he
wanted
to
exercise
the
right
to
make
it
null
and
void.
that's
what
those
four
decisions
--
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
it's
voidable,
yes.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
well,
if
a
man
exercised
a
voidable
right,
it
becomes
null
and
void,
does
it
not?
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
well,
your
honor,
we
have
to
go
back
--
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
--
the
basis
of
the
acquittal
is
the
indictment,
and
--
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
well,
he
was
acquitted
on
the
indictment
that
was
invalid.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
yes,
sir,
he
was.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
that
is
correct.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
that
is
correct.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
the
distinction,
your
honor,
is
in
the
validity
of
the
grand
jury.
can
an
unconstitutionally
organized
grand
jury
bring
back
a
valid
indictment?
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
in
maryland?
not
to
my
knowledge,
your
--
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
under
--
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
what's
that
--
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
alabama?
no,
there
was
--
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
i
thought
that
was
ala
state,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
they
have
--
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
in
arriving
at
that
disposition,
our
court
of
appeals
in
the
smith
case
quoted
the
exclusion
of
negros
from
grand
juries.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
i
believe
that
that
would
be
voidable
at
the
option
of
the
included
party
to
--
with
the
negro
in
that
case.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
no,
sir,
because
i
do
not
think
that
that
examp
--
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
i
don't
think
that
that
goes
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
that
goes
to
the
illegal
sentence,
but
the
court
still
had
jurisdiction
to
try
the
man
in
the
first
instance.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
this
court,
by
--
in
our
theory
and
under
the
court
of
appeals
case,
is
that
this
court,
once
this
man
voided
his
indictment,
he
voided
it,
he
exercised
his
option,
the
court
did
not
have
the
power
or
the
jurisdiction
either
to
convict
or
acquit.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
he
was
never
in
jeopardy.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
sir?
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
yes,
i
--
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
but
what
--
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
--
pardon?
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
well,
justice
fortas
--
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
well,
they
appear
in
the
madison
case
which
was
implementing
the
schowgurow
case.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
well,
the
only
--
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
no,
sir.
it
would
be
--
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
well
--
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
yes,
sir.
he
exercised
his
option.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
well,
as
far
as
this
particular
record
is
concerned,
your
honor,
and
this
has
never
been
challenged,
that
he
exercised
his
rights
in
conformity
with
these
cases,
and
--
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
yes,
sir.
as
far
as
the
record
here
before
the
court,
it
would
be
limited
to
that
because
this
a
question
--
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
well,
the
transcript
on
file
was
only
the
transcript,
your
honor,
of
the
second
trial.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
i
don't
understand
when
you
say
“inference
of
law.”
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
well,
your
honor,
to
this
point
--
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
no,
to
this
point,
this
question
has
never
been
raised
by
the
--
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
yes,
i
understand,
but
i
do
not
have
any
record
of
what
he
actually
said
--
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
and
it
was
never
challenged.
this
is
their
docket
entry
as
a
result
of
what
he
--
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
there
has
never
been
a
challenge
to
that
by
--
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
that's
right.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
yes,
sir.
i
would
say
that
this
was
the
procedure
setup
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
--
was
the
procedure
that
we
had
to
--
and
there
has
been
no
objection
to
--
that
was
applicable
to
the
defendant,
benton.
the
only
reflection
in
the
record
is
the
notation
of
the
docket
entry.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
yes,
i
understand
justice
fortas
had
a
different
--
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
he
was
referring
to
the
appendix,
i
believe.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
yes,
sir.
there
has
never
been

objection.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
i
honestly
do
not
know.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
that's
the
--
that
was
the
reason
i
do
not
know,
because
this
point
--
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
yes,
because
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
this
point
has
never
been
raised
that
he
exercised
his
rights
under
--
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
this
was
just
to
take
care
of
this
particular
situation
and
it
was
by
order
of
court
of
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland
and
rule
of
court
that
this
procedure
was
setup.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
well,
your
honor,
under
--
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
not
under
schowgurow,
he
could
not
have
done
that.
now,
maryland
has
a
case
on
this
particular
point
which
is
the
barger
case,
which
follows
this
court
in
the
green
case,
where
barger
was
convicted
of
murder
in
the
second
degree.
he
appealed
and
his
second-degree
conviction
was
set
aside
on
instructions
to
the
jury.
it
was
referred
back
to
the
lower
court
for
a
new
trial.
the
state
sought
to
indict
him
on
first-degree
murder.
he
objected.
the
lower
court
sustained
his
objection.
it
went
to
our
court
of
appeals,
and
our
court
of
appeals
sustained
it,
too,
on
the
basis
that
there
was
a
valid
indictment.
and,
as
you
gentlemen
understood
--
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
he's
not
asking
the
--
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
he
has
to
make
a
choice
if
he
would,
mr.
justice,
--
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
under
all
the
circumstances,
it
could
be.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
mr.
chief
justice,
there's
no
question
as
to
what
he
sought
to
raise
at
that
time.
this
was
the
second
trial
we're
referring
to.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
and,
he
raised
the
point
of
double
jeopardy.
but
he
didn't
raise
the
point
that
he
did
not
exercise
his
rights
within
the
confines
of
the
order
of
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
but,
yes,
his
challen
--
he
challenged
those
two
counts
of
the
indictment,
but
this
was
addressed
to
the
indictment
per
se
that
the
indictment
was
invalid.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
on
the
count
that
the
--
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
now,
on
the
record,
your
honor,
if
you
take
it
in
that
context,
the
record,
as
we
had
it
in
the
court
of
appeals,
there
was
never
--
or
the
court
of
special
appeal,
there
was
never
any
challenge
as
to
--3
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
--
as
he
did
exactly.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
yes,
sir.
he
made
--
the
only
choice
he
had
then
was
to
set
aside
the
indictment
or
not
to
set
aside
the
indictment.
now,
if
--
i
see
my
time
is
limited,
but
i'd
like
to
make
a
point,
that
point
as
to
the
larceny
count
itself,
your
honor,
although
i
see
my
time
is
up.
may
i
continue?
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
well,
as
far
as
the
retrial
on
the
larceny
count
itself,
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
it
was
under
--
the
first
count
was
common
law
burglary
in
maryland,
the
breaking
and
entering
in
the
nighttime
with
intent
to
commit
a
larceny
or
a
felony
there
into
a
larceny.
the
same
evidence
that
was
produced
to
approve
the
burglary
charge
proved
the
larceny
charge.
he
got
a
concurrent
sentence
and
he,
in
effect,
was
not
damaged
as
such.
the
--
as
to
the
part
on
the
fourth
point,
the
increased
punishment,
mr.
benton
has
filed
a
habeas
corpus
in
the
district
court
of
maryland.
he
has
been
granted
release
on
that
habeas
corpus
under
the
increased
punishment.
the
court
ordered
the
state
to
either
resentence
him
within
60
days
or
release
him,
and
we
have
taken
an
appeal
to
the
fourth
circuit.
so,
i
do
not
appeal
that
that
point
is
before
the
court
because
he
is
already
--
had
relief
on
that
and
the
last
point
is,
he
never
raised
the
increased
punishment
point
in
the
court
of
special
appeals
of
maryland.
and,
i
thank
you,
your
honors,
for
your
kind
attention.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
chief
justice
warren
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
basic
question
in
this
case
is
that
the
petitioner's
selection
to
be
re-indicted
by
declaring
that
his
original
indictment
was
null
and
void
under
schowgurow
and
his
subsequent
conviction
constitutes
double
jeopardy.
it
is
the
state's
position
that
it
does
not
constitute
double
jeopardy
in
this
case.
now,
as
my
brother
has
indicated,
mr.
benton
was
indicted
in
maryland
in
1965
of
the
three
counts,
as
he
had
indicated,
a
common
law
burglary,
housebreaking,
and
the
third
count
was
larceny.
he
was
convicted
of
the
larceny
count
or,
i
mean
--
excuse
me.
he
was
convicted
of
the
burglary
count
by
jury
in
neighboring
prince
george's
county,
and
the
state
abandoned
the
second
count,
and
he
was
found
not
guilty
as
to
the
larceny
count.
he
appealed
to
the
maryland
court
of
appeals
in
september
of
1965.
the
following
month,
maryland
--
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland
handed
down
the
decision
in
schowgurow,
and
so,
this
question
of
double
jeopardy
is
involved
in
the
procedural
set
up,
and
what
did
schowgurow
provide
as
far
as
the
maryland
judicial
system
was
concerned.
schowgurow
held
that
the
provisions
of
article
36
of
the
maryland
declarations
of
rights
requiring
a
belief
in
god
as
a
qualification
for
grand
jury
service
or
petty
jury
service
was
in
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution.
and,
that
was
predicated
because
of
this
court's
decision
in
torcaso,
the
year
or
two
before,
in
which
this
court
held
that
the
maryland
requirement
that
a
public
official
express
a
belief
in
god
under
article
37
was
in
violation.
now,
when
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland
reached
this
decision,
it
was
confronted
with,
and
there's
no
accurate
figures
but,
a
possibly,
in
the
neighborhood
it
was
estimated
around,
3,500
indictments
throughout
the
entire
judicial
system
of
maryland
that
had
been
indicted
by
the
--
an
invalid
grand
jury,
if
you
please.
now
--
so,
therefore,
they
limit
the
retroactivity
of
this
decision,
schowgurow,
to
the
cases
that
had
not
become
final
as
of
the
schowgurow
decision.
now,
in
order
to
implement
and
carryout
this,
and
it
was
a
gigantic
proposition
that
was
confronting
the
judicial
system
of
maryland
at
this
time,
there
were
several
other
cases
that
were
decide
within
three
or
four
days.
one
was
state
versus
madison.
the
question
in
state
versus
madison
was
that
an
accused
--
that
any
accused
that
was
indicted
or
convicted
by
such
an
improperly
constituted
grand
jury
had
the
right
to
have
the
original
indictment
declared
null
and
void
or
his
case
retried
without
showing
actual
prejudice.
and
now,
your
honors,
the
question
there
was,
should
a
member
of
the
so-called
excluded
class
be
entitled
to
raise
this
point
or
was
it
limited
only
to
the
included
class,
to
what
the
persons
that
did
not
believe
in
god?
and,
in
madison,
the
court,
i
think,
went
beyond
this
court
and
held
that
it
applied
to
both
the
excluded
class
and
the
included
class,
so
that
anyone
could
file
and
--
in
a
proper
proceeding
and
set
aside
his
indictment
because
it
was
brought
back
by
an
invalid
constituted
grand
jury,
to
which
a
grand
jury
that
was
in
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
now,
in
order
to
--
and,
also,
you'll
note
in
that
decision
they
held
that
the
individual
did
not
have
to
show
prejudice.
this
was
another
attempt
to
protect
the
rights
of
the
individual.
he
had
no
need
to
show
pric
--
that
he
was
prejudiced
by
this
unconstituted
--
unconstitutional
grand
jury.
then,
to
cover
another
point,
they
had
the
case
of
smith
versus
state.
these
all
happen
within
a
period
of
three
or
four
days,
as
they
implemented
this
decision.
it
was
held
that
there
could
be
an
intelligent
and
knowingly
waiver
of
the
defects
in
an
indictment
or
conviction
by
such
an
improperly
constituted
grand
jury.
this
meant
that
someone,
if
they
saw
fit,
they
could
waive
that
constitutionally
invalid
grand
jury.
then,
in
--
the
fourth
case
that
came
up
at
this
time
was
hayes
versus
wainwright
vers
--
hayes
and
wainwright
versus
state.
the
question
here
was,
did
someone
have
to
raise
this
point
in
the
lower
court
to
have
it
considered
by
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland?
and,
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
it
wasn't
necessary
that
they
raise
the
invalidity
of
the
grand
jury
in
the
lower
court.
they
all
could
have
benefit
of
it.
now,
in
that
framework,
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland
went
forth
and
set
up
guidelines.
they
remanded
approximately
221
cases,
which
is
an
exact
figure
form
their
records,
that
were
pending
in
the
system
in
the
--
before
the
appellate
court.
as
far
as
the
cases
that
were
indicted,
there
were
some
filed
in
the
classification.
they
had
been
indicted,
but
they
had
not
been
tried.
some
have
been
indicted,
had
been
tried,
but
not
--
had
not
taken
an
appeal.
and,
other
ones
would
fall
in
the
category
that
they
had
been
tried
and
they
were
acquitted
and
so,
they
were
out,
as
far
as
this
constitu
--
in
illegally
constituted
grand
jury.
now,
these
are
the
guidelines
that
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland
set
down
in
their
notice
to
the
lower
court.
they
said
that
the
accused
was
to
be
brought
into
the
trial
court
with
his
counsel
present
to
ascertain
whether
he
desires
to
avail
himself
of
the
rif
--
relief
afforded
by
the
ruling,
and/or
whether
he
elects
to
waive
any
objections
now
available
to
him,
under
this
decision,
the
four
that
i've
mentioned.
the
accused
--
second,
the
accused
is
to
be
informed
of
his
right
to
attack
his
conviction
and
of
the
fact
that
the
court
would
vacate
the
indictment
or
a
conviction
if
he
moved
them
to
do
so.
third,
the
accused
is
to
be
advised
that
he
is
subject
to
re-indictment
and
trial
if
he
elects
not
to
abide
by
his
present
status.
four,
the
accused
should
likewise
be
advised
that
if
he'd
be
reconvicted
of
any
new
sentence
to
be
imposed,
any
new
sentence
to
be
imposed
might
be
greater
or
less
than
the
one
or
ones
presently
against
him
within
the
maximum
limits.
five,
the
accused
is
to
be
told
that
he
can
waive
any
defects
in
the
grand
or
petty
jury
which
indicted
or
convicted
him,
notwithstanding
the
unlawful
composition
of
that
jury.
and,
last,
if
the
accused
selects
to
accept
the
indictment
or
trial
jury
as
valid
and
that
--
the
appeal
will
proceed
to
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
usual
way
on
the
grounds
of
bear
change.
now,
mr.
benton
was
brought
into
the
court
in
prince
george's
county.
he
was
advised
of
these
rights
in
the
presence
of
his
counsel
and
he
exercised
his
option
to
declare
his
original
indictment
null
and
void.
now
--
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
your
honor,
i
would
go
to
the
appendix.
it
would
be
in
the
docket
entried.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
it'd
be
on
page
2,
your
honor,
at
where
it
says
“defendant
challenges
the
array
of
the
grand
jury
on
june
30,
1966.”
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
well,
that
is
the
original
motion,
your
honor,
that
mr.
benton
made
in
the
lower
court
against
the
larceny
count.
but
then,
he
has
changed
it
as
he
proceeded
along
the
appellate
route.
he
has
changed
it
now
and
he
raises
the
point
that
he
is
prejudiced
on
the
larceny
count
by
the
mere
fact
--
or
by
the
fact,
i
should
say,
that
he
was
indicted
for
larceny
after
being
acquitted
of
same.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
no,
sir.
our
position
--
the
state's
position
that
this
--
when
mr.
benton
exercised
his
right
to
declare
his
indictment
null
and
void,
the
indictment
is
void
abenitio.
it
was
returned
by
it
illegally
or
unconstituted
--
unconstitutional
com
--
organized
grand
jury
and,
as
such,
since
he
exercised
that
right,
an
unconstitutionally
grand
jury
cannot
bring
back
a
valid
indictment
and,
therefore,
the
court
had
no
jurisdiction
and
he
was
therefore
not
placed
in
jeopardy
on
his
first
trial.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
well,
a
verdict
of
not
guilty
could
be
final
upon
it
being
given,
assuming
that
no
one
has
any
rights
to
appeal
and,
in
maryland,
the
state
does
not
have
the
right
to
--
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
no,
sir.
you're
correct.
he
would
not.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
i
would
say
it
was
final
at
the
day
it
was
rendered,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
well,
we
go
back
to
our
basic
premise
that
the
mere
fact
that
that
first
indictment
was
brought
by
an
unconstitutional
grand
jury,
that
it
did
not
bring
back
a
valid
indictment.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
well,
now,
you
referring,
i
assume
to
the
second
trial.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
so,
we
have
two
trials,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
his
final
--
it
was
final
if
the
indictment
was
valid.
it
was
final
if
the
court
had
jurisdiction
over
that
indictment,
yes.
i
would
agree.
it
would
be
final.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
it
depends
on
what
is
determined
unlawfully
drawn
and
there
are
some
cases
that
say
defective
and
so
forth,
but
i
say
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case
where
the
court
held
that
the
grand
jury
as
--
that
brought
back
this
indictment
was
unconstitutionally
organized.
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
constitution,
that
grand
jury
cannot
bring
a
valid
indictment,
if
that
is
so.
and,
mr.
benton
made
it
so
by
exercising
his
option,
and
he
was
told
that
the
indictment
would
be
null
and
void.
he
had
the
right
to
exercise
the
right
either
to
make
it
null
and
void
or
not.
that's
true,
but
once
he
did,
the
court
had
no
power
to
sent
--
or
no
power
to
try
him
on
the
invalid
indictment.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
yes,
sir?
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
that
is
correct.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
the
--
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
your
honor,
this
was
null
and
void
at
the
discretion
of
the
defendant.
it
was
up
to
him
to
declare
whether
he
wanted
to
exercise
the
right
to
make
it
null
and
void.
that's
what
those
four
decisions
--
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
it's
voidable,
yes.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
well,
if
a
man
exercised
a
voidable
right,
it
becomes
null
and
void,
does
it
not?
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
well,
your
honor,
we
have
to
go
back
--
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
--
the
basis
of
the
acquittal
is
the
indictment,
and
--
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
well,
he
was
acquitted
on
the
indictment
that
was
invalid.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
yes,
sir,
he
was.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
that
is
correct.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
that
is
correct.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
the
distinction,
your
honor,
is
in
the
validity
of
the
grand
jury.
can
an
unconstitutionally
organized
grand
jury
bring
back
a
valid
indictment?
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
in
maryland?
not
to
my
knowledge,
your
--
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
under
--
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
what's
that
--
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
alabama?
no,
there
was
--
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
i
thought
that
was
ala
state,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
they
have
--
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
in
arriving
at
that
disposition,
our
court
of
appeals
in
the
smith
case
quoted
the
exclusion
of
negros
from
grand
juries.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
i
believe
that
that
would
be
voidable
at
the
option
of
the
included
party
to
--
with
the
negro
in
that
case.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
no,
sir,
because
i
do
not
think
that
that
examp
--
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
i
don't
think
that
that
goes
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
that
goes
to
the
illegal
sentence,
but
the
court
still
had
jurisdiction
to
try
the
man
in
the
first
instance.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
this
court,
by
--
in
our
theory
and
under
the
court
of
appeals
case,
is
that
this
court,
once
this
man
voided
his
indictment,
he
voided
it,
he
exercised
his
option,
the
court
did
not
have
the
power
or
the
jurisdiction
either
to
convict
or
acquit.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
he
was
never
in
jeopardy.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
sir?
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
yes,
i
--
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
but
what
--
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
--
pardon?
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
well,
justice
fortas
--
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
well,
they
appear
in
the
madison
case
which
was
implementing
the
schowgurow
case.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
well,
the
only
--
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
no,
sir.
it
would
be
--
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
well
--
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
yes,
sir.
he
exercised
his
option.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
well,
as
far
as
this
particular
record
is
concerned,
your
honor,
and
this
has
never
been
challenged,
that
he
exercised
his
rights
in
conformity
with
these
cases,
and
--
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
yes,
sir.
as
far
as
the
record
here
before
the
court,
it
would
be
limited
to
that
because
this
a
question
--
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
well,
the
transcript
on
file
was
only
the
transcript,
your
honor,
of
the
second
trial.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
i
don't
understand
when
you
say
“inference
of
law.”
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
well,
your
honor,
to
this
point
--
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
no,
to
this
point,
this
question
has
never
been
raised
by
the
--
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
yes,
i
understand,
but
i
do
not
have
any
record
of
what
he
actually
said
--
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
and
it
was
never
challenged.
this
is
their
docket
entry
as
a
result
of
what
he
--
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
there
has
never
been
a
challenge
to
that
by
--
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
that's
right.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
yes,
sir.
i
would
say
that
this
was
the
procedure
setup
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
--
was
the
procedure
that
we
had
to
--
and
there
has
been
no
objection
to
--
that
was
applicable
to
the
defendant,
benton.
the
only
reflection
in
the
record
is
the
notation
of
the
docket
entry.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
yes,
i
understand
justice
fortas
had
a
different
--
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
he
was
referring
to
the
appendix,
i
believe.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
yes,
sir.
there
has
never
been
--
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
--
objection.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
i
honestly
do
not
know.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
that's
the
--
that
was
the
reason
i
do
not
know,
because
this
point
--
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
yes,
because
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
this
point
has
never
been
raised
that
he
exercised
his
rights
under
--
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
this
was
just
to
take
care
of
this
particular
situation
and
it
was
by
order
of
court
of
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland
and
rule
of
court
that
this
procedure
was
setup.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
well,
your
honor,
under
--
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
not
under
schowgurow,
he
could
not
have
done
that.
now,
maryland
has
a
case
on
this
particular
point
which
is
the
barger
case,
which
follows
this
court
in
the
green
case,
where
barger
was
convicted
of
murder
in
the
second
degree.
he
appealed
and
his
second-degree
conviction
was
set
aside
on
instructions
to
the
jury.
it
was
referred
back
to
the
lower
court
for
a
new
trial.
the
state
sought
to
indict
him
on
first-degree
murder.
he
objected.
the
lower
court
sustained
his
objection.
it
went
to
our
court
of
appeals,
and
our
court
of
appeals
sustained
it,
too,
on
the
basis
that
there
was
a
valid
indictment.
and,
as
you
gentlemen
understood
--
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
he's
not
asking
the
--
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
he
has
to
make
a
choice
if
he
would,
mr.
justice,
--
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
under
all
the
circumstances,
it
could
be.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
mr.
chief
justice,
there's
no
question
as
to
what
he
sought
to
raise
at
that
time.
this
was
the
second
trial
we're
referring
to.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
and,
he
raised
the
point
of
double
jeopardy.
but
he
didn't
raise
the
point
that
he
did
not
exercise
his
rights
within
the
confines
of
the
order
of
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
but,
yes,
his
challen
--
he
challenged
those
two
counts
of
the
indictment,
but
this
was
addressed
to
the
indictment
per
se
that
the
indictment
was
invalid.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
on
the
count
that
the
--
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
now,
on
the
record,
your
honor,
if
you
take
it
in
that
context,
the
record,
as
we
had
it
in
the
court
of
appeals,
there
was
never
--
or
the
court
of
special
appeal,
there
was
never
any
challenge
as
to
--3
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
--
as
he
did
exactly.
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
yes,
sir.
he
made
--
the
only
choice
he
had
then
was
to
set
aside
the
indictment
or
not
to
set
aside
the
indictment.
now,
if
--
i
see
my
time
is
limited,
but
i'd
like
to
make
a
point,
that
point
as
to
the
larceny
count
itself,
your
honor,
although
i
see
my
time
is
up.
may
i
continue?
mr.
edward
f.
borgerding
well,
as
far
as
the
retrial
on
the
larceny
count
itself,
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
it
was
under
--
the
first
count
was
common
law
burglary
in
maryland,
the
breaking
and
entering
in
the
nighttime
with
intent
to
commit
a
larceny
or
a
felony
there
into
a
larceny.
the
same
evidence
that
was
produced
to
approve
the
burglary
charge
proved
the
larceny
charge.
he
got
a
concurrent
sentence
and
he,
in
effect,
was
not
damaged
as
such.
the
--
as
to
the
part
on
the
fourth
point,
the
increased
punishment,
mr.
benton
has
filed
a
habeas
corpus
in
the
district
court
of
maryland.
he
has
been
granted
release
on
that
habeas
corpus
under
the
increased
punishment.
the
court
ordered
the
state
to
either
resentence
him
within
60
days
or
release
him,
and
we
have
taken
an
appeal
to
the
fourth
circuit.
so,
i
do
not
appeal
that
that
point
is
before
the
court
because
he
is
already
--
had
relief
on
that
and
the
last
point
is,
he
never
raised
the
increased
punishment
point
in
the
court
of
special
appeals
of
maryland.
and,
i
thank
you,
your
honors,
for
your
kind
attention.
