mr.
peter
l.
strauss
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
government
is
here
at
this
court's
invitation
to
present
its
views
whether
the
concurrent
sentence
doctrine
has
continuing
validity
in
light
of
last
term's
cases.
in
those
four
decisions,
as
the
court
knows,
it
reexamined
doctrines
limiting
review
of
criminal
sentences
which
an
accused
has
either
finished
serving
or
has
not
yet
began
to
serve
and
it
did
so
recognizing
that
in
addition
to
sentence
itself,
criminal
conviction
usually
have
legal
effects
such
as
laws
of
liberties
which
do
entitle
an
accuse
to
review.
for
example,
the
court
concluded
in
the
sibron
case
that
a
criminal
appeal
cannot
be
found
moot
simply
because
the
principle
sentence
has
been
served.
the
reviewing
court
must
be
convinced
by
the
government
that
there
are
no
residual
legal
effects
of
conviction
or
collateral
legal
consequences.
as
we
understand
the
question
which
the
court
invited
us
to
discuss,
it's
whether
the
same
rule
must
not
apply
in
concurrent
sentence
cases
that
is,
cases
in
which
an
accused
is
convicted
on
several
different
counts,
given
sentences
all
of
which
is
going
to
be
served
at
the
same
time,
and
then
seeks
to
appeal
on
a
ground
which
could
affect
only
some
and
not
all
of
those
convictions
and
sentences.
in
the
past,
courts
have
not
reviewed
all
counts
in
such
cases.
once
they
have
determined
that
some
of
the
counts
are
valid,
they
have
declines
to
review
others.
and
the
notion
has
been
that
since
the
full
sentence
must
be
served
in
any
event
on
the
good
counts,
nothing
could
be
gained
by
reviewing
the
others
but
review
of
the
limited
allegations
of
error
would
be
a
waste
of
their
time
and
energy.
we
agree
of
course
that
any
such
assessment
must
be
a
realistic
one.
review
must
be
had
as
to
any
count
which
in
fact
does
have
legal
effects
upon
the
convicted
person.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
yes.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well
i
think
on
collateral
attack,
the
case
is
all
the
stronger
for
the
concurrent
sentence
doctrine.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
our
argument
is
addressed
to
both
we
would
say
the
second.
this
is
a
direct
review
case
and
the
second
we
would
say
follow
a
fortiori.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
no,
your
honor.
i
would
--
you
asked
whether
that
ought
to
be
ignored,
i
think
i
would
prefer
if
i
may
rephrase
your
question
to
say,
to
put
it
as
whether
you're
asking
whether
the
government's
view
is
that
it
must
be
ignored
and
i
think
we
make
plain
in
our
brief
that
there
is
no
such
necessity
in
our
view.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
we
do
not
take
this
doctrine
as
being
jurisdiction.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well,
i
think
the
answer
is
no.
we
do
not
believe
that
the
doctrine
is
jurisdictional.
we
believe
that
there
is
any
good
reason
and
plain
error
may
be
a
good
reason
in
the
court's
view.
i
may
do
so
in
the
courts
of
appeals.
i
should
stress
that
our
principal
concern
is
not
in
this
court
but
in
the
federal
courts
of
appeals
which
have
a
tremendous
burden
of
criminal
appeals
before
them
and
which
very
frequently
will
receive
a
question
as
did
the
second
circuit
in
united
states
versus
berger,
in
which
we
cite
in
our
brief.
in
that
case,
the
defendant's
were
convicted
on
two
counts.
well,
one
of
the
substantive
offense
of
theft
from
interstate
commerce
and
the
other
of
a
conspiracy
to
commit
that
offense.
and
the
defendants
appealed
on
two
grounds.
one
that
it
was
not
interstate
commerce,
that
was
a
definite
ground.
and
second,
that
there
was
insufficient
evidence
in
the
record
to
support
the
conspiracy
conviction.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
characterized
that
record
is
being
an
extremely
lengthy
one,
and
having
found
that
there
was
interstate
commerce
stay
on
that
ground
declined
to
pass
upon
the
conspiracy
question.
on
the
other
hand,
one
frequently
finds
court
of
appeals
in
cases
where
error
is
plain
or
clear
passing
upon
it
and
we
would
say
that
they
have
every
right
to
do
so.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i'm
sorry.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
and
as
to
that
question
i
would
say,
that
i
believe
that
in
the
collateral
attack
circumstance,
the
court
would
be
much
less
justified
in
reaching
error
that
will
shield
it
that
is
our
argument,
follows
a
fortiori
in
that
circumstance.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
we
have
found
no
case
where
they
could
but
if
they
could.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
if
they
could,
then
we
believe
the
concurrent
sentence
doctrine
could
not
be
applied
because
that
we
do
concede
that
if
there
is
a
substantial
reason
for
review,
then
review
must
be
have.
oh,
well
there
could
be
an
alternative
in
that
circumstance.
one
could
also
say
as
we
have
indicated
in
a
opposition
which
we
recently
filed
and
another
case
before
the
court,
number
1022,
proner
versus
united
states.
that
was
a
tax
case
in
which
the
petitioner
raised
certain
questions
which
the
court
of
appeals
again
determined
only
pertained
to
limited
numbers
of
counts
and
specifically
determined
there
was
no
crossover
effect.
and
the
petitioner
in
that
case
alleges
that
there
will
be
a
collateral
estoppel
that
there
will
be
in
civil
actions
to
collect
the
taxes
which
are
allegedly
due
from
him.
that
there
will
be
some
collateral
estoppel
by
these
judgments
in
the
particular
counts
that
he
challenged.
and
what
we
say
there
is
that
since
there
was
no
review,
there
could
be
no
collateral
estoppel.
and
i
think
it
would
be
equally
possible
in
the
case
you
put,
mr.
chief
justice
to
say
that
since
review
was
declined
on
the
basis
of
the
concurrent
sentence
doctrine,
that
conviction
could
not
be
counted
towards
recidivism.
so
there
are
the
alternatives
in
the
case
that
you
put.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
think
again
the
answer
is
that
in
most
states,
it
could
not.
as
we
state
in
our
brief,
in
most
states,
recidivist
statutes
are
designed
to
vindicate
the
state's
interest
in
having
prisoners
learn
from
going
to
jail.
and
so
they
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i'm
not
sure
that
they'll
all
do
that
but
i
do
think
that
those
cases
where
they
don't
do
that
can
be
dealt
with
separately,
and
certainly
in
the
federal
system
which
is
our
concern,
they
don't
do
that.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
then
the
answer
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
think
if
one
were
able
to
determine
that
the
concurrent
sentence
doctrine
had
been
applied
25
years
ago.
one
would
do
so
through
the
medium
of
an
appellate
court
decision
and
that
decision
would
probably
sufficiently
indicate
the
fact
to
enable
the
judge
to
make
the
determination
as
readily
as
he
could
to
determination
of
the
concurrent
sentence
doctrine
had
been
applied.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
but
then
the
record
of
the
application
of
a
concurrent
sentence
doctrine
would
also
but
then
the
record
of
the
application
of
the
concurrent
sentence
doctrine
would
also
have
been
lost
or
destroyed.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
as
i
say
your
honor,
my
principal
defense
is
that
is
in
all
states
that
we
know
of.
i
can't
say
to
you
that
this
isn't
the
case
but
so
far
as
we
know,
as
soon
as
it
appeared
that
conviction
was
had
on
the
same
date
or
the
same
indictment
or
the
same
trial.
however
many
counts
there
were,
the
court
would
consider
it
one
count
for
purpose
of
the
recidivist
statute.
because
of
the
function
of
that
statute
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
believe
that
is
the
case
although
they
were
entirely
separate
and
distinct.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
think
that
would
offend
the
legislative
policy
or
the
recidivist
statute
as
i
understand
that.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well
i
think
it's
in
--
what
we're
speaking
of,
a
case
where
the
opinion
through
disruption
or
some
other
circumstance
is
destroyed
so
that
it
does
not
reflect
whether
the
concurrent
sentence
doctrine
was
applied.
so
that
it
does
not
reflect
whether
they
were
separate
cases.
so
that
a
state
court
goes
against
the
grain
of
its
recidivist
statute
and
applies
it
to
count
more
than
once
from
the
single
conviction.
although
on
multiple
counts,
i
think
all
of
those
things
put
together
really
are
an
extraordinarily
remote
circumstance.
and
i
would
say
if
they
occurred.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
if
they
occurred,
i
would
think
that
man
would
have
a
sound
claim
to
not
having
the
statute
applied
to
him
as
a
matter
of
due
process.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
but
the
state
would
have
had
to
go
back
25
years
to
establish
that
the
other
was
essential.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
but
the
state
were
able
to
come
up
with
one
part
of
the
record.
it
seems
to
me
probably
they
could
have
come
up
with
the
remainder
of
the
record.
if
there
is
a
record
of
the
conviction,
i
would
think
that
would
also
be
a
record
of
the
appellate
proceedings.
we're
not
talking
about
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
--
transcripts.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
to
prove
which,
your
honor?
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
would
say
that
once
the
double
punishments
were
shown
it
was
the
burden
of
the
state
to
prove
that
he
was
injured.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
this
is
not
the
case
of
application
of
recidivist
statute,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
am
--
well
i
don't
wish
to
speak
for
the
maryland
law
because
i'm
sure
the
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
think
this
court
could
in
this
case
if
it
wished
to
indicate
perfectly
plainly
that
where
double
convictions
occur
on
a
single
trial
occasion.
that
if
review
is
not
had
as
to
all
counts
and
if
the
record
doesn't
show
review
has
had
as
to
all
counts
if
in
no
other
circumstances.
those
double
convictions
cannot
be
counted
twice.
and
since
the
situation
is
so
remote
and
i
genuinely
do
believe
it
is.
i
think
that
that
would
be
an
adequate
response,
particularly
in
view
of
the
genuine
importance
of
this
doctrine
in
the
courts
of
appeals.
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
berger
case
would
otherwise
have
to
read
what
it
considered
to
be
an
extremely
lengthy
record.
that
time
would
have
been
taken
away
from
other
pending
appeals,
meritorious
appeals,
appeals
where
the
court
could
have
done
something.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well,
we
made
a
survey
as
you
know
in
our
brief
indicating
that
in
something
like
40%
of
the
appellate
cases
that
had
come
before
the
court
this
term
45%
concurrent
counsel
present.
sampling
of
those
and
we
were
able
to
do
only
a
sampling
of
those
indicate
in
about
20%
of
those
cases
the
concurrent
sentence
doctrine
was
used.
now
if
i
may
go
back
to
the
question
justice
fortas
asked
before,
i
think
the
doctrine
was
under
used
in
a
sense
that
there
were
some
cases
in
which
the
doctrine
wasn't
use
because
the
claim
of
error
on
the
concurrent
count
was
so
clear
one
way
or
another,
that
it
was
as
efficient
or
more
efficient
simply
to
deal
with
it,
and
that
frequently
happens.
but
i
think
the
answer
is
about
20%
or
in
about
roughly
10%
of
the
appeals
that
have
come
up,
20%
of
45%.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
of
a
--?
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well,
there
were
3851
criminal
appeals
in
1968,
that
would
be
about
385,
400,
350.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
all
criminal
appeals
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
--
about
10%
of
that.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
it's
45%,
we
assume.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
yes.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
yes
i
would
--
as
a
projection
from
our
figures
which
are
subject
to
error
of
course.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
this
is
in
the
federal
system
only
and
these
are
very
rarely
cases
as
this
court
appreciates.
these
are
very
rarely
cases
on
which
this
court
grants
certiorari.
the
question
which
concerns
us
is
the
problem
of
a
court
that
has
no
discretion
to
say
this
question
is
not
important.
we
won't
hear
it
except
as
the
harmless
error
doctrine
or
the
concurrent
sentence
doctrine
may
enable
it
to
identify.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well,
it
must
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
alright,
it
must
first
determine
that
some
other
count
is
good.
it
must
also
determine
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
alright.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
our
position
is
that
if
no
crossover
prejudice
occurs,
if
no
legal
incidents
are
present
this
is
harmless
error
like
any
other
kind
of
harmless
error
and
the
court
need
not
review
and
as
in
harmless
error
generally,
if
the
error
which
is
claimed
is
one
which
on
its
face
appears
to
be
substantial,
appears
likely
to
have
infected
the
whole
proceedings,
that's
sufficient
to
just
to
require
review.
if
on
the
other
hand
it
is
not,
if
the
court
can
determine
that
it
did
not
affect
the
other
proceedings,
that
there
will
be
no
collateral
consequences
then
it
need
not
review.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
think
that's
right.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well,
it
is
in
a
fashion
that
is
if
the
petitioner
in
that
circumstance
could
show
as
part
of
his
petition
that
the
other
counts
under
which
he
is
being
concurrently
held
were
infected
by
that
error
then
he
would
be
entitled
to
review.
now,
there
will
be
the
situation
on
habeas
corpus
which
there
is
not
in
direct
appeal.
someone
may
have
had
two
separate
trials.
of
course
the
concurrent
sentence
doctrine
could
never
foreclose
review
from
separate
trials
but
there
would
be
the
no
possibility
of
alleging
that
trial
error
at
one
trial
had
prejudiced
the
result
of
the
other.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
no,
your
honor,
if
i
may
take
a
--
what
one
may
call
a
statutory
or
a
non-constitutional
error,
before
the
passage
of
a
harmless
error
statute
which
i'm
not
talking
about,
i'm
not
talking
about
the
constitutional
error
here
for
a
moment.
before
the
passage
of
the
constitutional
error
statute,
plainly
the
situation
you're
referring
to
is
inexistent
equally
plainly
that
that
statute
was
passed
to
change
that
situation
and
the
legislative
history
we
find
that
the
house
saying
and
one
is
very
short
report.
a
report
that
was
adopted
by
this
court
in
(inaudible)
that
unless
the
error
appears
on
its
face
to
be
a
substantial
one
which
would
prejudiced
substantial
right
in
which
event
review
should
be
have
but
unless
that
is
the
case
it
is
the
burden
of
the
appellant
to
show
that
there
was
error.
now,
i
realized
that
there
is
the
court
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
to
show
that
it
prejudiced
to
substantial
rights,
excuse
me.
there
is
the
chapman
case
but
the
court
did
repeatedly
stress
in
that
case
that
it
was
dealing
with
constitutional
error
and
as
i
understand
it,
it
really
involved
the
determination
of
constitutional
error
would
be
error
affecting
substantial
rights
and
that
seems
to
me
(voice
overlap)
fair.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
in
respect
of
constitutional
error
what
one
asked
to
remember
is
that
here
unlike
chapman
the
constitutional
error
by
hypothesis
does
not
go
to
the
whole
conviction.
it
goes
only
one
of
several
counts
and
while
chapman
provides
authority
for
the
proposition.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
it
doesn't
have
independently
all
of
the
incidents
which
a
conviction
will
have.
it
doesn't
independently
if
the
other
convictions
entered
at
the
same
time
excite
with
recidivist
statutes.
it
doesn't
independently
authorized
confinement.
it
doesn't
independently
serve
as
a
mode
of
impeachment.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
think
not.
i
think
first
that
we
do
say
that
there
is
more
--
we
would
acknowledge
that
there
is
more
room
for
discretion.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
although
the
theoretical
premise
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
we
believe
it
is.
we
don't
believe
there's
a
jurisdictional
basis.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
alright.
we
would
think
it
would
be
wholly
regrettable
to
adopt
the
sibron
rule
for
the
reasons
we
put
out
but
yes.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
which
distinctions?
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
no.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
no,
that's
not
in
the
brief
but
i
think
it
does
follow
from
our
particular
approach
to
the
question
that
they
are
there.
i
would
also
say
with
respect
to
the
constitutional
versus
statutory
question
we
do
not
believe
there
should
be
any
distinction
but
it
certainly
we
couldn't
say
that
that
might
not
be
an
appropriate
basis
of
distinction.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
yes?
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
think
if
he
--
i
think
if
these
are
two
separate
trials,
i
think
this
is
--no,
no,
excuse
me,
two
separate
matters
and
not
a
larceny
which
took
place
in
the
middle
of
the
burglary
as
it
is
in
this
case.
i
think
we
do
in
our
brief
acknowledged
that
that
is
a
case
in
which
court
should
be
much
more
ready
not
to
apply
the
concurrent
sentence
doctrine
in
which
the
question
of
prejudice
appears
much
more
readily
than
it
does
in
the
case.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
thought
we
were
speaking
about
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
one
of
them
is
admittedly
bad
with
these
separate
trials
or
a
single
trial,
your
honor?
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
would
think
that
question
should
be
raised
on
appeal?
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
would
think
had
he
not
raise
the
question
on
appeal
that
it
would
be
competent
at
that
point
to
decline
to
pass
on
the
allegation
on
the
basis
of
the
good
count
unless
he
could
show
and
quite
possibly
he
could
show
that
the
bad
can
prejudice
the
good
count.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well,
then
i
think
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
but
it
has
no
effect
on
it.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
which
has
no
effect
upon
it,
which
has
no
legal
incident,
no
legal
effect
upon
them?
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
think
we're
arguing
principally
on
the
grounds
of
judicial
efficiency
which
we
set
out
in
our
brief
that
to
require
appellate
courts
which
are
very
hard
pressed,
i'm
talking
about
the
courts
of
appeals
to
stand
what
may
very
frequently
be
a
very
long
period
of
time
considering
questions
as
to
which
they
can
do
absolutely
nothing
a
practical
benefit
to
the
petitioner
involved,
the
appellant
involved
is
to
engage
them
in
ways
to
work.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well,
again
it
seems
from
what
i
know
of
criminal
practice
the
more
general
practice
is
to
ask,
“are
you
the
man
that
was
convicted
on
such
and
such
a
date
of
entering
--
breaking
and
entering
into
somebody's
home?”
and
not
to
specify
each
of
the
independent
counts
if
you
have
35-count
mail
fraud
statute.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
the
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
it
could
certainly
be
the
jury
--
could
certainly
be
told
that,
that
was
the
same
offense.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
counsel
for
petitioner
--
for
the
defendant
or
the
defendant
themselves.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
can
they
say
that
it
was
the
same
count?
that
it
was
the
same
offense
i
would
--
should
certainly
think
of
the
state
were
entitled
to
try
and
get
the
jury
to
believe
that
they
were
separate
matters
that
the
defendant
would
be
entitled
to
show
that
they
were
one
and
the
same
and
that
the
state
was
out
trying
to
squeeze
more
juice
from
the
orange
than
it
had
in
it.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
should
think
they
would
be
able
to
that
extent.
i
should
also
think
that
as
we
again,
as
we
make
out
in
our
proner
brief
that
it
would
be
competent
to
rule
that
where
there
were
such
incidental
possibilities
as
that,
simply
that
they
could,
that
it
could
not
be
given
collateral
effect
of
that
source
that
if
review
was
declined
for
reasons
of
the
concurrent
sentence
doctrine
on
a
particular
count
that
should
a
prosecutor
be
so
minded
as
to
do
what
you
suggested
in
the
future
he
simply
could
not
do
so
and
his
doing
so
would
be
error.
and
that
would
to
us
at
least
be
considerably
the
more
efficient
means
of
dealing
with
the
situation
rather
than
as
in
this
berger
case
forcing
the
court
of
appeals
to
read
the
four
or
five
volume
record
to
determine
a
question
which
couldn't
really
affect
the
practical
outcome
of
the
case
before
it
and
which
would
delay
and
quite
possibly
prejudice
the
decision
of
the
appeals
and
other
pending
cases.
thank
you.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
government
is
here
at
this
court's
invitation
to
present
its
views
whether
the
concurrent
sentence
doctrine
has
continuing
validity
in
light
of
last
term's
cases.
in
those
four
decisions,
as
the
court
knows,
it
reexamined
doctrines
limiting
review
of
criminal
sentences
which
an
accused
has
either
finished
serving
or
has
not
yet
began
to
serve
and
it
did
so
recognizing
that
in
addition
to
sentence
itself,
criminal
conviction
usually
have
legal
effects
such
as
laws
of
liberties
which
do
entitle
an
accuse
to
review.
for
example,
the
court
concluded
in
the
sibron
case
that
a
criminal
appeal
cannot
be
found
moot
simply
because
the
principle
sentence
has
been
served.
the
reviewing
court
must
be
convinced
by
the
government
that
there
are
no
residual
legal
effects
of
conviction
or
collateral
legal
consequences.
as
we
understand
the
question
which
the
court
invited
us
to
discuss,
it's
whether
the
same
rule
must
not
apply
in
concurrent
sentence
cases
that
is,
cases
in
which
an
accused
is
convicted
on
several
different
counts,
given
sentences
all
of
which
is
going
to
be
served
at
the
same
time,
and
then
seeks
to
appeal
on
a
ground
which
could
affect
only
some
and
not
all
of
those
convictions
and
sentences.
in
the
past,
courts
have
not
reviewed
all
counts
in
such
cases.
once
they
have
determined
that
some
of
the
counts
are
valid,
they
have
declines
to
review
others.
and
the
notion
has
been
that
since
the
full
sentence
must
be
served
in
any
event
on
the
good
counts,
nothing
could
be
gained
by
reviewing
the
others
but
review
of
the
limited
allegations
of
error
would
be
a
waste
of
their
time
and
energy.
we
agree
of
course
that
any
such
assessment
must
be
a
realistic
one.
review
must
be
had
as
to
any
count
which
in
fact
does
have
legal
effects
upon
the
convicted
person.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
yes.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well
i
think
on
collateral
attack,
the
case
is
all
the
stronger
for
the
concurrent
sentence
doctrine.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
our
argument
is
addressed
to
both
we
would
say
the
second.
this
is
a
direct
review
case
and
the
second
we
would
say
follow
a
fortiori.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
no,
your
honor.
i
would
--
you
asked
whether
that
ought
to
be
ignored,
i
think
i
would
prefer
if
i
may
rephrase
your
question
to
say,
to
put
it
as
whether
you're
asking
whether
the
government's
view
is
that
it
must
be
ignored
and
i
think
we
make
plain
in
our
brief
that
there
is
no
such
necessity
in
our
view.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
we
do
not
take
this
doctrine
as
being
jurisdiction.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well,
i
think
the
answer
is
no.
we
do
not
believe
that
the
doctrine
is
jurisdictional.
we
believe
that
there
is
any
good
reason
and
plain
error
may
be
a
good
reason
in
the
court's
view.
i
may
do
so
in
the
courts
of
appeals.
i
should
stress
that
our
principal
concern
is
not
in
this
court
but
in
the
federal
courts
of
appeals
which
have
a
tremendous
burden
of
criminal
appeals
before
them
and
which
very
frequently
will
receive
a
question
as
did
the
second
circuit
in
united
states
versus
berger,
in
which
we
cite
in
our
brief.
in
that
case,
the
defendant's
were
convicted
on
two
counts.
well,
one
of
the
substantive
offense
of
theft
from
interstate
commerce
and
the
other
of
a
conspiracy
to
commit
that
offense.
and
the
defendants
appealed
on
two
grounds.
one
that
it
was
not
interstate
commerce,
that
was
a
definite
ground.
and
second,
that
there
was
insufficient
evidence
in
the
record
to
support
the
conspiracy
conviction.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
characterized
that
record
is
being
an
extremely
lengthy
one,
and
having
found
that
there
was
interstate
commerce
stay
on
that
ground
declined
to
pass
upon
the
conspiracy
question.
on
the
other
hand,
one
frequently
finds
court
of
appeals
in
cases
where
error
is
plain
or
clear
passing
upon
it
and
we
would
say
that
they
have
every
right
to
do
so.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i'm
sorry.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
and
as
to
that
question
i
would
say,
that
i
believe
that
in
the
collateral
attack
circumstance,
the
court
would
be
much
less
justified
in
reaching
error
that
will
shield
it
that
is
our
argument,
follows
a
fortiori
in
that
circumstance.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
we
have
found
no
case
where
they
could
but
if
they
could.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
if
they
could,
then
we
believe
the
concurrent
sentence
doctrine
could
not
be
applied
because
that
we
do
concede
that
if
there
is
a
substantial
reason
for
review,
then
review
must
be
have.
oh,
well
there
could
be
an
alternative
in
that
circumstance.
one
could
also
say
as
we
have
indicated
in
a
opposition
which
we
recently
filed
and
another
case
before
the
court,
number
1022,
proner
versus
united
states.
that
was
a
tax
case
in
which
the
petitioner
raised
certain
questions
which
the
court
of
appeals
again
determined
only
pertained
to
limited
numbers
of
counts
and
specifically
determined
there
was
no
crossover
effect.
and
the
petitioner
in
that
case
alleges
that
there
will
be
a
collateral
estoppel
that
there
will
be
in
civil
actions
to
collect
the
taxes
which
are
allegedly
due
from
him.
that
there
will
be
some
collateral
estoppel
by
these
judgments
in
the
particular
counts
that
he
challenged.
and
what
we
say
there
is
that
since
there
was
no
review,
there
could
be
no
collateral
estoppel.
and
i
think
it
would
be
equally
possible
in
the
case
you
put,
mr.
chief
justice
to
say
that
since
review
was
declined
on
the
basis
of
the
concurrent
sentence
doctrine,
that
conviction
could
not
be
counted
towards
recidivism.
so
there
are
the
alternatives
in
the
case
that
you
put.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
think
again
the
answer
is
that
in
most
states,
it
could
not.
as
we
state
in
our
brief,
in
most
states,
recidivist
statutes
are
designed
to
vindicate
the
state's
interest
in
having
prisoners
learn
from
going
to
jail.
and
so
they
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i'm
not
sure
that
they'll
all
do
that
but
i
do
think
that
those
cases
where
they
don't
do
that
can
be
dealt
with
separately,
and
certainly
in
the
federal
system
which
is
our
concern,
they
don't
do
that.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
then
the
answer
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
think
if
one
were
able
to
determine
that
the
concurrent
sentence
doctrine
had
been
applied
25
years
ago.
one
would
do
so
through
the
medium
of
an
appellate
court
decision
and
that
decision
would
probably
sufficiently
indicate
the
fact
to
enable
the
judge
to
make
the
determination
as
readily
as
he
could
to
determination
of
the
concurrent
sentence
doctrine
had
been
applied.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
but
then
the
record
of
the
application
of
a
concurrent
sentence
doctrine
would
also
but
then
the
record
of
the
application
of
the
concurrent
sentence
doctrine
would
also
have
been
lost
or
destroyed.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
as
i
say
your
honor,
my
principal
defense
is
that
is
in
all
states
that
we
know
of.
i
can't
say
to
you
that
this
isn't
the
case
but
so
far
as
we
know,
as
soon
as
it
appeared
that
conviction
was
had
on
the
same
date
or
the
same
indictment
or
the
same
trial.
however
many
counts
there
were,
the
court
would
consider
it
one
count
for
purpose
of
the
recidivist
statute.
because
of
the
function
of
that
statute
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
believe
that
is
the
case
although
they
were
entirely
separate
and
distinct.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
think
that
would
offend
the
legislative
policy
or
the
recidivist
statute
as
i
understand
that.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well
i
think
it's
in
--
what
we're
speaking
of,
a
case
where
the
opinion
through
disruption
or
some
other
circumstance
is
destroyed
so
that
it
does
not
reflect
whether
the
concurrent
sentence
doctrine
was
applied.
so
that
it
does
not
reflect
whether
they
were
separate
cases.
so
that
a
state
court
goes
against
the
grain
of
its
recidivist
statute
and
applies
it
to
count
more
than
once
from
the
single
conviction.
although
on
multiple
counts,
i
think
all
of
those
things
put
together
really
are
an
extraordinarily
remote
circumstance.
and
i
would
say
if
they
occurred.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
if
they
occurred,
i
would
think
that
man
would
have
a
sound
claim
to
not
having
the
statute
applied
to
him
as
a
matter
of
due
process.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
but
the
state
would
have
had
to
go
back
25
years
to
establish
that
the
other
was
essential.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
but
the
state
were
able
to
come
up
with
one
part
of
the
record.
it
seems
to
me
probably
they
could
have
come
up
with
the
remainder
of
the
record.
if
there
is
a
record
of
the
conviction,
i
would
think
that
would
also
be
a
record
of
the
appellate
proceedings.
we're
not
talking
about
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
--
transcripts.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
to
prove
which,
your
honor?
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
would
say
that
once
the
double
punishments
were
shown
it
was
the
burden
of
the
state
to
prove
that
he
was
injured.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
this
is
not
the
case
of
application
of
recidivist
statute,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
am
--
well
i
don't
wish
to
speak
for
the
maryland
law
because
i'm
sure
the
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
think
this
court
could
in
this
case
if
it
wished
to
indicate
perfectly
plainly
that
where
double
convictions
occur
on
a
single
trial
occasion.
that
if
review
is
not
had
as
to
all
counts
and
if
the
record
doesn't
show
review
has
had
as
to
all
counts
if
in
no
other
circumstances.
those
double
convictions
cannot
be
counted
twice.
and
since
the
situation
is
so
remote
and
i
genuinely
do
believe
it
is.
i
think
that
that
would
be
an
adequate
response,
particularly
in
view
of
the
genuine
importance
of
this
doctrine
in
the
courts
of
appeals.
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
berger
case
would
otherwise
have
to
read
what
it
considered
to
be
an
extremely
lengthy
record.
that
time
would
have
been
taken
away
from
other
pending
appeals,
meritorious
appeals,
appeals
where
the
court
could
have
done
something.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well,
we
made
a
survey
as
you
know
in
our
brief
indicating
that
in
something
like
40%
of
the
appellate
cases
that
had
come
before
the
court
this
term
45%
concurrent
counsel
present.
sampling
of
those
and
we
were
able
to
do
only
a
sampling
of
those
indicate
in
about
20%
of
those
cases
the
concurrent
sentence
doctrine
was
used.
now
if
i
may
go
back
to
the
question
justice
fortas
asked
before,
i
think
the
doctrine
was
under
used
in
a
sense
that
there
were
some
cases
in
which
the
doctrine
wasn't
use
because
the
claim
of
error
on
the
concurrent
count
was
so
clear
one
way
or
another,
that
it
was
as
efficient
or
more
efficient
simply
to
deal
with
it,
and
that
frequently
happens.
but
i
think
the
answer
is
about
20%
or
in
about
roughly
10%
of
the
appeals
that
have
come
up,
20%
of
45%.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
of
a
--?
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well,
there
were
3851
criminal
appeals
in
1968,
that
would
be
about
385,
400,
350.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
all
criminal
appeals
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
--
about
10%
of
that.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
it's
45%,
we
assume.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
yes.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
yes
i
would
--
as
a
projection
from
our
figures
which
are
subject
to
error
of
course.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
this
is
in
the
federal
system
only
and
these
are
very
rarely
cases
as
this
court
appreciates.
these
are
very
rarely
cases
on
which
this
court
grants
certiorari.
the
question
which
concerns
us
is
the
problem
of
a
court
that
has
no
discretion
to
say
this
question
is
not
important.
we
won't
hear
it
except
as
the
harmless
error
doctrine
or
the
concurrent
sentence
doctrine
may
enable
it
to
identify.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well,
it
must
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
alright,
it
must
first
determine
that
some
other
count
is
good.
it
must
also
determine
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
alright.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
our
position
is
that
if
no
crossover
prejudice
occurs,
if
no
legal
incidents
are
present
this
is
harmless
error
like
any
other
kind
of
harmless
error
and
the
court
need
not
review
and
as
in
harmless
error
generally,
if
the
error
which
is
claimed
is
one
which
on
its
face
appears
to
be
substantial,
appears
likely
to
have
infected
the
whole
proceedings,
that's
sufficient
to
just
to
require
review.
if
on
the
other
hand
it
is
not,
if
the
court
can
determine
that
it
did
not
affect
the
other
proceedings,
that
there
will
be
no
collateral
consequences
then
it
need
not
review.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
think
that's
right.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well,
it
is
in
a
fashion
that
is
if
the
petitioner
in
that
circumstance
could
show
as
part
of
his
petition
that
the
other
counts
under
which
he
is
being
concurrently
held
were
infected
by
that
error
then
he
would
be
entitled
to
review.
now,
there
will
be
the
situation
on
habeas
corpus
which
there
is
not
in
direct
appeal.
someone
may
have
had
two
separate
trials.
of
course
the
concurrent
sentence
doctrine
could
never
foreclose
review
from
separate
trials
but
there
would
be
the
no
possibility
of
alleging
that
trial
error
at
one
trial
had
prejudiced
the
result
of
the
other.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
no,
your
honor,
if
i
may
take
a
--
what
one
may
call
a
statutory
or
a
non-constitutional
error,
before
the
passage
of
a
harmless
error
statute
which
i'm
not
talking
about,
i'm
not
talking
about
the
constitutional
error
here
for
a
moment.
before
the
passage
of
the
constitutional
error
statute,
plainly
the
situation
you're
referring
to
is
inexistent
equally
plainly
that
that
statute
was
passed
to
change
that
situation
and
the
legislative
history
we
find
that
the
house
saying
and
one
is
very
short
report.
a
report
that
was
adopted
by
this
court
in
(inaudible)
that
unless
the
error
appears
on
its
face
to
be
a
substantial
one
which
would
prejudiced
substantial
right
in
which
event
review
should
be
have
but
unless
that
is
the
case
it
is
the
burden
of
the
appellant
to
show
that
there
was
error.
now,
i
realized
that
there
is
the
court
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
to
show
that
it
prejudiced
to
substantial
rights,
excuse
me.
there
is
the
chapman
case
but
the
court
did
repeatedly
stress
in
that
case
that
it
was
dealing
with
constitutional
error
and
as
i
understand
it,
it
really
involved
the
determination
of
constitutional
error
would
be
error
affecting
substantial
rights
and
that
seems
to
me
(voice
overlap)
fair.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
in
respect
of
constitutional
error
what
one
asked
to
remember
is
that
here
unlike
chapman
the
constitutional
error
by
hypothesis
does
not
go
to
the
whole
conviction.
it
goes
only
one
of
several
counts
and
while
chapman
provides
authority
for
the
proposition.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
it
doesn't
have
independently
all
of
the
incidents
which
a
conviction
will
have.
it
doesn't
independently
if
the
other
convictions
entered
at
the
same
time
excite
with
recidivist
statutes.
it
doesn't
independently
authorized
confinement.
it
doesn't
independently
serve
as
a
mode
of
impeachment.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
think
not.
i
think
first
that
we
do
say
that
there
is
more
--
we
would
acknowledge
that
there
is
more
room
for
discretion.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
although
the
theoretical
premise
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
we
believe
it
is.
we
don't
believe
there's
a
jurisdictional
basis.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
alright.
we
would
think
it
would
be
wholly
regrettable
to
adopt
the
sibron
rule
for
the
reasons
we
put
out
but
yes.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
which
distinctions?
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
no.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
no,
that's
not
in
the
brief
but
i
think
it
does
follow
from
our
particular
approach
to
the
question
that
they
are
there.
i
would
also
say
with
respect
to
the
constitutional
versus
statutory
question
we
do
not
believe
there
should
be
any
distinction
but
it
certainly
we
couldn't
say
that
that
might
not
be
an
appropriate
basis
of
distinction.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
yes?
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
think
if
he
--
i
think
if
these
are
two
separate
trials,
i
think
this
is
--no,
no,
excuse
me,
two
separate
matters
and
not
a
larceny
which
took
place
in
the
middle
of
the
burglary
as
it
is
in
this
case.
i
think
we
do
in
our
brief
acknowledged
that
that
is
a
case
in
which
court
should
be
much
more
ready
not
to
apply
the
concurrent
sentence
doctrine
in
which
the
question
of
prejudice
appears
much
more
readily
than
it
does
in
the
case.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
thought
we
were
speaking
about
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
one
of
them
is
admittedly
bad
with
these
separate
trials
or
a
single
trial,
your
honor?
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
would
think
that
question
should
be
raised
on
appeal?
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
would
think
had
he
not
raise
the
question
on
appeal
that
it
would
be
competent
at
that
point
to
decline
to
pass
on
the
allegation
on
the
basis
of
the
good
count
unless
he
could
show
and
quite
possibly
he
could
show
that
the
bad
can
prejudice
the
good
count.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well,
then
i
think
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
but
it
has
no
effect
on
it.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
which
has
no
effect
upon
it,
which
has
no
legal
incident,
no
legal
effect
upon
them?
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
think
we're
arguing
principally
on
the
grounds
of
judicial
efficiency
which
we
set
out
in
our
brief
that
to
require
appellate
courts
which
are
very
hard
pressed,
i'm
talking
about
the
courts
of
appeals
to
stand
what
may
very
frequently
be
a
very
long
period
of
time
considering
questions
as
to
which
they
can
do
absolutely
nothing
a
practical
benefit
to
the
petitioner
involved,
the
appellant
involved
is
to
engage
them
in
ways
to
work.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well,
again
it
seems
from
what
i
know
of
criminal
practice
the
more
general
practice
is
to
ask,
“are
you
the
man
that
was
convicted
on
such
and
such
a
date
of
entering
--
breaking
and
entering
into
somebody's
home?”
and
not
to
specify
each
of
the
independent
counts
if
you
have
35-count
mail
fraud
statute.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
the
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
it
could
certainly
be
the
jury
--
could
certainly
be
told
that,
that
was
the
same
offense.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
counsel
for
petitioner
--
for
the
defendant
or
the
defendant
themselves.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
can
they
say
that
it
was
the
same
count?
that
it
was
the
same
offense
i
would
--
should
certainly
think
of
the
state
were
entitled
to
try
and
get
the
jury
to
believe
that
they
were
separate
matters
that
the
defendant
would
be
entitled
to
show
that
they
were
one
and
the
same
and
that
the
state
was
out
trying
to
squeeze
more
juice
from
the
orange
than
it
had
in
it.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
should
think
they
would
be
able
to
that
extent.
i
should
also
think
that
as
we
again,
as
we
make
out
in
our
proner
brief
that
it
would
be
competent
to
rule
that
where
there
were
such
incidental
possibilities
as
that,
simply
that
they
could,
that
it
could
not
be
given
collateral
effect
of
that
source
that
if
review
was
declined
for
reasons
of
the
concurrent
sentence
doctrine
on
a
particular
count
that
should
a
prosecutor
be
so
minded
as
to
do
what
you
suggested
in
the
future
he
simply
could
not
do
so
and
his
doing
so
would
be
error.
and
that
would
to
us
at
least
be
considerably
the
more
efficient
means
of
dealing
with
the
situation
rather
than
as
in
this
berger
case
forcing
the
court
of
appeals
to
read
the
four
or
five
volume
record
to
determine
a
question
which
couldn't
really
affect
the
practical
outcome
of
the
case
before
it
and
which
would
delay
and
quite
possibly
prejudice
the
decision
of
the
appeals
and
other
pending
cases.
thank
you.
