justice
abe
fortas
counsel,
may
i
ask
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
you
a
question
here?
justice
abe
fortas
as
i
understand
the
argument,
perhaps
i'm
wrong
about
it,
what
you're
really
saying
is
that
the
petitioner
here
waived
the
--
improperly
waive
whatever
defect
there
was
in
the
composition
of
the
grand
jury
and
you
refer
to
that
as
petitioner
having
agreed
that
the
original
indictment
was
null
and
void.
chief
justice
asked
you
where
that
appears.
you
pointed
to
page
2
of
the
appendix,
the
item
june
30,
1966,
but
that
reads
only
“defendant
challenges
the
array
of
the
grand
jury.”
is
there
some
place
that
shows
exactly
what
the
defendant
did
to
which
you
refer
as
agreeing
that
the
original
indictment
was
null
and
void?
justice
abe
fortas
where
do
the
words
“null
and
void”
appear?
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
not
talking
about
that.
you
said
that
this
petitioner
said
that
the
original
indictment
was
null
and
void,
isn't
that
what
you
said?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
does
--
is
that
in
the
record
and,
if
so,
where?
justice
abe
fortas
it's
not
in
this
appendix.
justice
abe
fortas
now,
is
it
in
the
printed
transcript
of
record
on
file
here?
justice
abe
fortas
i
wanted
--
you
say
this
defendant,
this
petitioner,
agreed
that
the
indictment
was
null
and
void
and
that
what
you
said?
justice
abe
fortas
what
i'm
interested
exactly
what
were
the
words
used,
where
does
it
appear?
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that,
but
i
want
to
know
exactly
what
happened,
what
did
he
say
or
what
did
his
counsel
say
for
him?
chief
justice
asked
you
that
question.
and,
is
your
answer
to
it
confined
to
the
entry
that
appears
on
page
2
of
the
appendix?
justice
abe
fortas
and
there's
nothing
else
in
the
transcript
on
file?
justice
abe
fortas
alright,
so
when
you
say
the
defendant
agreed
that
the
first
indictment
was
null
and
void,
that's
your
inference
of
law,
is
it?
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
trying
to
find
out
what
happened.
what
happened
here?
what
did
the
defendant
do?
what
did
he
say
that
leads
you
to
characterize
it
as
a
statement
by
the
defendant
that
the
indictment
was
null
and
void?
justice
abe
fortas
a
very
simple
inquiry
of
fact,
i
think.
justice
abe
fortas
it's
being
raised
right
now
by
me.
justice
abe
fortas
but,
my
point
is,
my
question
to
you
is
that
there's
--
there
may
be
a
difference,
i'm
not
saying
that
there
is,
there
may
be
a
difference
between
the
defendant
electing
to
appeal
and
try
to
get
the
judgment
set
aside
on
the
one
hand
and,
on
the
other
hand,
the
defendant
saying
that,
agreeing
through
--
directly
or
through
counsel
or
both,
that
the
original
indictment
was
null
and
void.
as
i
listen
to
your
argument,
you
seem
to
put
in
a
good
deal
of
weight
on
that
specific
characterization
to
which
you
say
the
defendant
agreed,
but
it's
now
my
understanding
that
that
is
an
inference
or
a
conclusion
that
you
urge
upon
this
court
as
a
result
of
the
events
listed
in
the
first
six
items
appearing
on
page
1
and
2
of
the
appendix.
now
do
we
have
it
straighten
out?
justice
abe
fortas
and,
on
the
first
day
of
trial,
his
counsel
said
that
--
his
counsel
raised
the
point
that
made
the
point
that
he
shouldn't
be
tried
for
these
other
offenses.
justice
abe
fortas
i
don't
understand
this
for
another
reason.
i
thought
that
this
reargument
was
limited
to
the
hirabayashi
question
and
nothing
else
and
that's
the
question
that,
it's
the
only
question
that
is
before
the
court
for
purposes
of
this
re-argument,
isn't
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
sir
as
i
understand
that
the
solicitor
general
argues
that
the
burden
should
be
on
the
petitioner.
it
is
showed
that
unless
his
concurrent
sentences
were
viewed
prejudice
will
resolve
to
him.
is
that
your
understanding?
justice
abe
fortas
and
if
you
look
at
it
from
the
point
of
view
of
burden
who
has
the
burden
of
demonstration
however
you
want
to
flatten
more
precisely.
what
do
you
say
about
that?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
let
me
be
sure
that
i
understand
this.
so,
you
are
presenting
a
clear
issue
on
that
point
that
is
to
say
solicitor
general
says
that
it's
the
petitioner's
burden
to
show
that
unless
his
concurrent
sentence
will
be
reviewed
he
will
be
prejudiced.
do
you
say
that
if
a
prisoner
asks
a
review
of
his
concurrent
sentence
that
the
burden
is
on
the
state
to
demonstrate
that
there
could
be
no
possible
prejudice
to
him
if
his
concurrent
sentence
is
not
reviewed?
justice
abe
fortas
am
i
correct
in
stating
the
position?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
strauss.
justice
abe
fortas
excuse
me,
would
you
make
a
distinction
between
review
of
a
concurrent
sentence
on
direct
appeal
and
on
collateral
attack.
justice
abe
fortas
well
is
your
argument
addressed
to
both,
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
say.
justice
abe
fortas
but
there
is
a
--
some
sort
of
a
differences
there
in
terms
of
judicial
latitude,
let's
suppose
that,
i'm
talking
of
theory
now
of
course.
in
terms
of
a
direct
appeal,
let
us
suppose
that
there's
a
clear
error
with
respect
to
a
concurrent
sentence.
is
it
the
government's
view
that
that
ought
to
be
ignored
unless
the
petition,
unless
the
prisoner,
the
accused
can
show
prejudice
even
though
it's
on
direct
appeal
as
distinguished
from
collateral
attack?
justice
abe
fortas
no
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
no,
i
don't
know.
when
you
rephrase
the
question
that
way,
i
don't
understand
what
the
government's
position
is.
justice
abe
fortas
now,
you
kind
of
left
me
at
the
post.
justice
abe
fortas
i
want
to
get
you
right
back
to
the
question,
is
there
any
difference
in
the
government's
position
depending
upon
whether
the
question
of
error
on
a
concurrent
sentence
is
presented
by
way
of
direct
appeal
on
the
one
hand
and
on
the
other
hand
by
a
collateral
attack
whether
it's
a
habeas
corpus
or
2255?
that
is
my
precise
question
to
this.
justice
abe
fortas
well
let's
take
that
sort
of
a
case
and
let's,
that
is
to
say
let's
take
an
appeal
from
a
district
court
to
court
of
appeals
a
direct
appeal
and
the
defendant
has
been
--
has
received
concurrent
sentences.
now
is
it
your
position
that
because
there
are
concurrent
sentences
or
court
of
appeals
can
decline
to
consider
alleged
error
with
respect
to
one
of
those
concurrent
sentences.
justice
abe
fortas
but
then,
i'm
talking
now
about
the
count
--
justice
abe
fortas
well
then,
no
question
about
it.
no
question
about
the
other
count.
justice
abe
fortas
and
the
court
is
presented
with
a
direct
appeal
from
a
concurrent
sentence
on
a
count
that
is
suppose
to
be
infected
by
constitutional
errors,
some
other
kind
of
error.
justice
abe
fortas
so,
your
theory
really
is
a
harmless
error
theory?
justice
abe
fortas
with
respect
to
direct
appeal
now,
well
supposed
it's
2255
in
the
federal
case
or
habeas
corpus
in
federal
review
state.
no,
let's
simplify
it,
let's
take
2255,
direct
appeal
the
federal
case
--
direct
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals
of
federal
case
from
district
court's
denial
of
2255
and
an
attack
on
the
concurrent
judgment,
the
concurrent
count
for
to
receive
concurrent
sentence
and
do
you
still
rely
on
that
harmless
error
theory?
justice
abe
fortas
alright,
now
mr.
strauss,
the
problem
is
that
i
have
difficulty
in
squaring
this
theory
with
the
government's
argument
that
the
burden
should
be
on
the
prisoner.
if
you
say
that
this
is
harmless
error
that
your
theoretical
basis
for
court's
declining
to
review
the
judgment
on
a
concurrent
sentence
situation
is
harmless
error,
then
how
can
you
say
that
the
burden
should
be
on
the
prisoner
to
show
that
it
was
not
harmless?
so,
isn't
that
just
the
opposite
of
what
usually
happens
in
harmless
error
situation?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
is
this
a
very
efficient
procedure
that
we
have
in
this
case
where
they
took
advantage
of
this
multiple
sentence
and
not
only
went
through
to
all
of
the
maryland's
courts
but
had
been
in
this
court
and
had
it
reargued
and
so
forth.
if
the
state
only
took
advantage
of
those
same
which
would
not
hurt
that
the
fact
and
would
not
help
them
wouldn't
we
be
relieved
of
all
these
things
and
why
is
it
necessary
for
the
state
to
keep
a
man
under
a
conviction
of
two
offenses
where
there
is
no
difference
in
his
sentence
as
you
say.
and
what
benefit
could
there
be
to
the
state
to
keep
him
under
the
cloud
of
those
two
convictions
when
one
would
do
justice
well
from
a
standpoint
of
the
state
of
rehabilitating
him
and
if
you
choose
punishing
him
whatever
theory
you
have
of
sentencing
the
defendants.
why
do
you
want
to
fight
as
you
do
for
all
of
these
things
when
there
is
no
good
to
anybody
and
some
harm
possibly
to
others?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
your
honor,
i
think
i
agree
with
you
to
this
extent
that
the
same
end
could
be
served
from
the
state's
interest
by
imposing
a
single
general
sentence
and
as
you
recall
this
is
the
situation
in
which
the
question
is
most
frequently
arisen
in
this
case
--
in
this
court
at
least
which
arose
most
early
but
the
concurrent
sentence
serves
one
function.
it
enables
the
trial
judge
to
give
a
reviewing
court
some
indication
how
he
views
each
of
the
crimes
charged
on
the
indictment.
now,
this
might
very
well
have
been
an
appeal
where
the
15-year
burglary
sentence
was
under
appeal.
and
the
five-year
larceny
count
was
not
and
if
there
were
a
general
sentence
in
those
circumstances
assuming
15
years
is
possible
under
the
maryland
larceny
statute,
i
don't
know.
and
the
court
found
that
the
burglary
count
was
bad
under
general
sentence
to
15
years
and
said,
“well,
since
the
larceny
count
supports
it
anyway
we
won't
do
anything
quite
plainly,
there
would
have
been
substantial
prejudice
to
the
accused.
so,
i
think
the
concurrent
sentence
does
serve
a
valuable
purpose
in
that
respect.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
attorney
general
--
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
attorney
general,
let's
see
if
i
can
get
this
straight
in
my
own
mind.
this
defendant
was
first
tried
for
larceny
and
burglary.
he
was
found
guilty
of
burglary,
not
guilty
on
the
larceny
charge.
justice
abe
fortas
he
was
sentence
to
10
years
in
prison
on
the
burglary
charge.
he
then
appealed
and
the
conviction
was
set
aside
on
the
basis
of
schowgurow
case.
justice
abe
fortas
oh,
whatever
--
justice
abe
fortas
no,
but
some
must
have
--
justice
abe
fortas
some
must
have
happen
and
summons
was
vacated,
something
happened.
then
he
was
tried
again
and
he
was
convicted
on
both
counts.
justice
abe
fortas
and
he
was
sentence
to
five
years
as
time
for
larceny
for
which
he
have
been
previously
acquitted.
justice
abe
fortas
and
15
years
for
burglary,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
and
now
you
have
told
us
a
few
moments
ago
that
the
united
states
district
court,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
in
maryland,
has
entered
some
kind
of
an
order
reducing
--
justice
abe
fortas
on
the
burglary
count
so
now
he
has
a
10-year
sentence
on
the
burglary
count
and
a
5-year
sentence
on
the
larceny
count
to
run
concurrently.
justice
abe
fortas
and
you
tell
us
at
that
decisions
of
the
order
of
the
district
court
the
federal
district
court
is
on
appeal
to
the
fourth
circuit,
is
that
correct?
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
as
we
set
here
we
don't
know
whether
this
case
will
involve
a
5-year
sentence
on
larceny
and
a
15-year
sentence
on
burglary
or
whether
it
will
involve
of
5
and
10
years
sentence?
justice
abe
fortas
the
original
sentence
being
10
years
i
supposed
that
the
ultimate
outcome
of
this
fourth
circuit
proceeding
has
some
bearing
on
the
question
of
harmless
error
that
should
be
the
theory,
is
that
correct?
with
respect
to
the
concurrent
sentence
problem.
justice
abe
fortas
i
see.
justice
abe
fortas
and
still
have
5
and
10-year
--
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
attorney
general,
--
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
attorney
general,
maryland
does
have
an
appeal
as
of
right
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
from
the
criminal
conviction.
justice
abe
fortas
do
you
see
a
distinction
which
of
consequence
between
the
considerations
of
the
concurrent
sentence
doctrine
on
direct
appeal
as
compared
with
its
application
and
collateral
attack.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
attorney
general,
what
is
--
can
you
tell
me
what
the
actual
practices
in
maryland
on
appeals
on
criminal
cases,
is
it
really
the
practice
to
refuse
to
review
a
concurrent
sentence?
what
does
your
appellate
court
do?
justice
abe
fortas
what
is
the
practice?
does
it
generally
going
ahead
and
review
an
appeal
from
a
concurrent
sentence
or
does
it
generally
decline
to
do
it?
justice
abe
fortas
i
know
that.
justice
abe
fortas
but
that
would
not
be
true
if
you
were
serving
concurrent
sentences
for
two
different
transactions
so
to
speak.
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
in
this
case?
justice
abe
fortas
how
do
say
a
proceeding
now
pending
in
the
fourth
circuit
cut
across
of
the
propriety
we're
considering,
the
former
jeopardy
point
or
maybe
your
view,
maybe
it
does
but
what
do
you
have
to
say
about
that?
justice
abe
fortas
why?
justice
abe
fortas
now
was
that
because
of
the
jeopardy
point?
justice
abe
fortas
right.
now,
whether
that
right
or
wrong
or
what
its
implications
are,
it
is
a
question
that
is
now
before
the
fourth
circuit
as
i
understand
it?
justice
abe
fortas
and
it's
possible
i
suppose,
i
know
it's
possible
that
it
is
necessarily
something
that's
involved
in
your
submission
that
this
court
on
the
former
jeopardy
point.
justice
abe
fortas
oh,
i
understand
that
that
is
the
case
but
if
i
haven't
seen
the
district
court
opinion,
i
didn't
know
until
this
morning
that
district
court
had
filed
an
opinion
but
that
was
the
--
what
the
district
court's
reduction
of
sentence
here
or
order
of
the
sentence
should
be
reduced
was
in
response
to
a
full-fledged
former
jeopardy
argument,
wasn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
no,
it
was
not.
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
the
only
argument
that
was
made
to
the
district
court?
justice
abe
fortas
i
see.
so
the
argument
that
has
been
presented
to
us
namely
the
conviction
after
the
dismissal
of
the
county
whatever
the
enlargement
county
this
was,
that
was
not
presented
at
the
district
courts,
is
that
what
you're
telling
us?
justice
abe
fortas
counsel,
may
i
ask
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
you
a
question
here?
justice
abe
fortas
as
i
understand
the
argument,
perhaps
i'm
wrong
about
it,
what
you're
really
saying
is
that
the
petitioner
here
waived
the
--
improperly
waive
whatever
defect
there
was
in
the
composition
of
the
grand
jury
and
you
refer
to
that
as
petitioner
having
agreed
that
the
original
indictment
was
null
and
void.
chief
justice
asked
you
where
that
appears.
you
pointed
to
page
2
of
the
appendix,
the

1966,
but
that
reads
only
“defendant
challenges
the
array
of
the
grand
jury.”
is
there
some
place
that
shows
exactly
what
the
defendant
did
to
which
you
refer
as
agreeing
that
the
original
indictment
was
null
and
void?
justice
abe
fortas
where
do
the
words
“null
and
void”
appear?
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
not
talking
about
that.
you
said
that
this
petitioner
said
that
the
original
indictment
was
null
and
void,
isn't
that
what
you
said?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
does
--
is
that
in
the
record
and,
if
so,
where?
justice
abe
fortas
it's
not
in
this
appendix.
justice
abe
fortas
now,
is
it
in
the
printed
transcript
of
record
on
file
here?
justice
abe
fortas
i
wanted
--
you
say
this
defendant,
this
petitioner,
agreed
that
the
indictment
was
null
and
void
and
that
what
you
said?
justice
abe
fortas
what
i'm
interested
exactly
what
were
the
words
used,
where
does
it
appear?
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that,
but
i
want
to
know
exactly
what
happened,
what
did
he
say
or
what
did
his
counsel
say
for
him?
chief
justice
asked
you
that
question.
and,
is
your
answer
to
it
confined
to
the
entry
that
appears
on
page
2
of
the
appendix?
justice
abe
fortas
and
there's
nothing
else
in
the
transcript
on
file?
justice
abe
fortas
alright,
so
when
you
say
the
defendant
agreed
that
the
first
indictment
was
null
and
void,
that's
your
inference
of
law,
is
it?
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
trying
to
find
out
what
happened.
what
happened
here?
what
did
the
defendant
do?
what
did
he
say
that
leads
you
to
characterize
it
as
a
statement
by
the
defendant
that
the
indictment
was
null
and
void?
justice
abe
fortas
a
very
simple
inquiry
of
fact,
i
think.
justice
abe
fortas
it's
being
raised
right
now
by
me.
justice
abe
fortas
but,
my
point
is,
my
question
to
you
is
that
there's
--
there
may
be
a
difference,
i'm
not
saying
that
there
is,
there
may
be
a
difference
between
the
defendant
electing
to
appeal
and
try
to
get
the
judgment
set
aside
on
the
one
hand
and,
on
the
other
hand,
the
defendant
saying
that,
agreeing
through
--
directly
or
through
counsel
or
both,
that
the
original
indictment
was
null
and
void.
as
i
listen
to
your
argument,
you
seem
to
put
in
a
good
deal
of
weight
on
that
specific
characterization
to
which
you
say
the
defendant
agreed,
but
it's
now
my
understanding
that
that
is
an
inference
or
a
conclusion
that
you
urge
upon
this
court
as
a
result
of
the
events
listed
in
the
first
six
items
appearing
on
page
1
and
2
of
the
appendix.
now
do
we
have
it
straighten
out?
justice
abe
fortas
and,
on
the
first
day
of
trial,
his
counsel
said
that
--
his
counsel
raised
the
point
that
made
the
point
that
he
shouldn't
be
tried
for
these
other
offenses.
justice
abe
fortas
i
don't
understand
this
for
another
reason.
i
thought
that
this
reargument
was
limited
to
the
hirabayashi
question
and
nothing
else
and
that's
the
question
that,
it's
the
only
question
that
is
before
the
court
for
purposes
of
this
re-argument,
isn't
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
sir
as
i
understand
that
the
solicitor
general
argues
that
the
burden
should
be
on
the
petitioner.
it
is
showed
that
unless
his
concurrent
sentences
were
viewed
prejudice
will
resolve
to
him.
is
that
your
understanding?
justice
abe
fortas
and
if
you
look
at
it
from
the
point
of
view
of
burden
who
has
the
burden
of
demonstration
however
you
want
to
flatten
more
precisely.
what
do
you
say
about
that?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
let
me
be
sure
that
i
understand
this.
so,
you
are
presenting
a
clear
issue
on
that
point
that
is
to
say
solicitor
general
says
that
it's
the
petitioner's
burden
to
show
that
unless
his
concurrent
sentence
will
be
reviewed
he
will
be
prejudiced.
do
you
say
that
if
a
prisoner
asks
a
review
of
his
concurrent
sentence
that
the
burden
is
on
the
state
to
demonstrate
that
there
could
be
no
possible
prejudice
to
him
if
his
concurrent
sentence
is
not
reviewed?
justice
abe
fortas
am
i
correct
in
stating
the
position?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
strauss.
justice
abe
fortas
excuse
me,
would
you
make
a
distinction
between
review
of
a
concurrent
sentence
on
direct
appeal
and
on
collateral
attack.
justice
abe
fortas
well
is
your
argument
addressed
to
both,
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
say.
justice
abe
fortas
but
there
is
a
--
some
sort
of
a
differences
there
in
terms
of
judicial
latitude,
let's
suppose
that,
i'm
talking
of
theory
now
of
course.
in
terms
of
a
direct
appeal,
let
us
suppose
that
there's
a
clear
error
with
respect
to
a
concurrent
sentence.
is
it
the
government's
view
that
that
ought
to
be
ignored
unless
the
petition,
unless
the
prisoner,
the
accused
can
show
prejudice
even
though
it's
on
direct
appeal
as
distinguished
from
collateral
attack?
justice
abe
fortas
no
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
no,
i
don't
know.
when
you
rephrase
the
question
that
way,
i
don't
understand
what
the
government's
position
is.
justice
abe
fortas
now,
you
kind
of
left
me
at
the
post.
justice
abe
fortas
i
want
to
get
you
right
back
to
the
question,
is
there
any
difference
in
the
government's
position
depending
upon
whether
the
question
of
error
on
a
concurrent
sentence
is
presented
by
way
of
direct
appeal
on
the
one
hand
and
on
the
other
hand
by
a
collateral
attack
whether
it's
a
habeas
corpus
or
2255?
that
is
my
precise
question
to
this.
justice
abe
fortas
well
let's
take
that
sort
of
a
case
and
let's,
that
is
to
say
let's
take
an
appeal
from
a
district
court
to
court
of
appeals
a
direct
appeal
and
the
defendant
has
been
--
has
received
concurrent
sentences.
now
is
it
your
position
that
because
there
are
concurrent
sentences
or
court
of
appeals
can
decline
to
consider
alleged
error
with
respect
to
one
of
those
concurrent
sentences.
justice
abe
fortas
but
then,
i'm
talking
now
about
the
count
--
justice
abe
fortas
well
then,
no
question
about
it.
no
question
about
the
other
count.
justice
abe
fortas
and
the
court
is
presented
with
a
direct
appeal
from
a
concurrent
sentence
on
a
count
that
is
suppose
to
be
infected
by
constitutional
errors,
some
other
kind
of
error.
justice
abe
fortas
so,
your
theory
really
is
a
harmless
error
theory?
justice
abe
fortas
with
respect
to
direct
appeal
now,
well
supposed
it's
2255
in
the
federal
case
or
habeas
corpus
in
federal
review
state.
no,
let's
simplify
it,
let's
take
2255,
direct
appeal
the
federal
case
--
direct
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals
of
federal
case
from
district
court's
denial
of
2255
and
an
attack
on
the
concurrent
judgment,
the
concurrent
count
for
to
receive
concurrent
sentence
and
do
you
still
rely
on
that
harmless
error
theory?
justice
abe
fortas
alright,
now
mr.
strauss,
the
problem
is
that
i
have
difficulty
in
squaring
this
theory
with
the
government's
argument
that
the
burden
should
be
on
the
prisoner.
if
you
say
that
this
is
harmless
error
that
your
theoretical
basis
for
court's
declining
to
review
the
judgment
on
a
concurrent
sentence
situation
is
harmless
error,
then
how
can
you
say
that
the
burden
should
be
on
the
prisoner
to
show
that
it
was
not
harmless?
so,
isn't
that
just
the
opposite
of
what
usually
happens
in
harmless
error
situation?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
is
this
a
very
efficient
procedure
that
we
have
in
this
case
where
they
took
advantage
of
this
multiple
sentence
and
not
only
went
through
to
all
of
the
maryland's
courts
but
had
been
in
this
court
and
had
it
reargued
and
so
forth.
if
the
state
only
took
advantage
of
those
same
which
would
not
hurt
that
the
fact
and
would
not
help
them
wouldn't
we
be
relieved
of
all
these
things
and
why
is
it
necessary
for
the
state
to
keep
a
man
under
a
conviction
of
two
offenses
where
there
is
no
difference
in
his
sentence
as
you
say.
and
what
benefit
could
there
be
to
the
state
to
keep
him
under
the
cloud
of
those
two
convictions
when
one
would
do
justice
well
from
a
standpoint
of
the
state
of
rehabilitating
him
and
if
you
choose
punishing
him
whatever
theory
you
have
of
sentencing
the
defendants.
why
do
you
want
to
fight
as
you
do
for
all
of
these
things
when
there
is
no
good
to
anybody
and
some
harm
possibly
to
others?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
your
honor,
i
think
i
agree
with
you
to
this
extent
that
the
same
end
could
be
served
from
the
state's
interest
by
imposing
a
single
general
sentence
and
as
you
recall
this
is
the
situation
in
which
the
question
is
most
frequently
arisen
in
this
case
--
in
this
court
at
least
which
arose
most
early
but
the
concurrent
sentence
serves
one
function.
it
enables
the
trial
judge
to
give
a
reviewing
court
some
indication
how
he
views
each
of
the
crimes
charged
on
the
indictment.
now,
this
might
very
well
have
been
an
appeal
where
the
15-year
burglary
sentence
was
under
appeal.
and
the
five-year
larceny
count
was
not
and
if
there
were
a
general
sentence
in
those
circumstances
assuming
15
years
is
possible
under
the
maryland
larceny
statute,
i
don't
know.
and
the
court
found
that
the
burglary
count
was
bad
under
general
sentence
to
15
years
and
said,
“well,
since
the
larceny
count
supports
it
anyway
we
won't
do
anything
quite
plainly,
there
would
have
been
substantial
prejudice
to
the
accused.
so,
i
think
the
concurrent
sentence
does
serve
a
valuable
purpose
in
that
respect.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
attorney
general
--
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
attorney
general,
let's
see
if
i
can
get
this
straight
in
my
own
mind.
this
defendant
was
first
tried
for
larceny
and
burglary.
he
was
found
guilty
of
burglary,
not
guilty
on
the
larceny
charge.
justice
abe
fortas
he
was
sentence
to
10
years
in
prison
on
the
burglary
charge.
he
then
appealed
and
the
conviction
was
set
aside
on
the
basis
of
schowgurow
case.
justice
abe
fortas
oh,
whatever
--
justice
abe
fortas
no,
but
some
must
have
--
justice
abe
fortas
some
must
have
happen
and
summons
was
vacated,
something
happened.
then
he
was
tried
again
and
he
was
convicted
on
both
counts.
justice
abe
fortas
and
he
was
sentence
to
five
years
as
time
for
larceny
for
which
he
have
been
previously
acquitted.
justice
abe
fortas
and
15
years
for
burglary,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
and
now
you
have
told
us
a
few
moments
ago
that
the
united
states
district
court,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
in
maryland,
has
entered
some
kind
of
an
order
reducing
--
justice
abe
fortas
on
the
burglary
count
so
now
he
has
a
10-year
sentence
on
the
burglary
count
and
a
5-year
sentence
on
the
larceny
count
to
run
concurrently.
justice
abe
fortas
and
you
tell
us
at
that
decisions
of
the
order
of
the
district
court
the
federal
district
court
is
on
appeal
to
the
fourth
circuit,
is
that
correct?
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
as
we
set
here
we
don't
know
whether
this
case
will
involve
a
5-year
sentence
on
larceny
and
a
15-year
sentence
on
burglary
or
whether
it
will
involve
of
5
and
10
years
sentence?
justice
abe
fortas
the
original
sentence
being
10
years
i
supposed
that
the
ultimate
outcome
of
this
fourth
circuit
proceeding
has
some
bearing
on
the
question
of
harmless
error
that
should
be
the
theory,
is
that
correct?
with
respect
to
the
concurrent
sentence
problem.
justice
abe
fortas
i
see.
justice
abe
fortas
and
still
have
5
and
10-year
--
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
attorney
general,
--
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
attorney
general,
maryland
does
have
an
appeal
as
of
right
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
from
the
criminal
conviction.
justice
abe
fortas
do
you
see
a
distinction
which
of
consequence
between
the
considerations
of
the
concurrent
sentence
doctrine
on
direct
appeal
as
compared
with
its
application
and
collateral
attack.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
attorney
general,
what
is
--
can
you
tell
me
what
the
actual
practices
in
maryland
on
appeals
on
criminal
cases,
is
it
really
the
practice
to
refuse
to
review
a
concurrent
sentence?
what
does
your
appellate
court
do?
justice
abe
fortas
what
is
the
practice?
does
it
generally
going
ahead
and
review
an
appeal
from
a
concurrent
sentence
or
does
it
generally
decline
to
do
it?
justice
abe
fortas
i
know
that.
justice
abe
fortas
but
that
would
not
be
true
if
you
were
serving
concurrent
sentences
for
two
different
transactions
so
to
speak.
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
in
this
case?
justice
abe
fortas
how
do
say
a
proceeding
now
pending
in
the
fourth
circuit
cut
across
of
the
propriety
we're
considering,
the
former
jeopardy
point
or
maybe
your
view,
maybe
it
does
but
what
do
you
have
to
say
about
that?
justice
abe
fortas
why?
justice
abe
fortas
now
was
that
because
of
the
jeopardy
point?
justice
abe
fortas
right.
now,
whether
that
right
or
wrong
or
what
its
implications
are,
it
is
a
question
that
is
now
before
the
fourth
circuit
as
i
understand
it?
justice
abe
fortas
and
it's
possible
i
suppose,
i
know
it's
possible
that
it
is
necessarily
something
that's
involved
in
your
submission
that
this
court
on
the
former
jeopardy
point.
justice
abe
fortas
oh,
i
understand
that
that
is
the
case
but
if
i
haven't
seen
the
district
court
opinion,
i
didn't
know
until
this
morning
that
district
court
had
filed
an
opinion
but
that
was
the
--
what
the
district
court's
reduction
of
sentence
here
or
order
of
the
sentence
should
be
reduced
was
in
response
to
a
full-fledged
former
jeopardy
argument,
wasn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
no,
it
was
not.
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
the
only
argument
that
was
made
to
the
district
court?
justice
abe
fortas
i
see.
so
the
argument
that
has
been
presented
to
us
namely
the
conviction
after
the
dismissal
of
the
county
whatever
the
enlargement
county
this
was,
that
was
not
presented
at
the
district
courts,
is
that
what
you're
telling
us?
