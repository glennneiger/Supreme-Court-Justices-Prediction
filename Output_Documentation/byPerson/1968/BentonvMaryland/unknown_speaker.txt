unknown
speaker
mr.
strauss,
do
you
have
any
figures
that
indicate
how
many
criminal
appeals
were
disposed
of
on
concurrent
sentence
doctrine?
unknown
speaker
as
an
absolute
number,
what's
that
went
to?
unknown
speaker
as
an
absolute
figure,
what's
that
went
to?
unknown
speaker
as
i
say
3850
add
all
criminal
appeals
not
just
those
involved
in
concurrent
sentences.
unknown
speaker
yes,
how
many
--
unknown
speaker
and
how
many
of
the
total
number
of
the
criminal
appeals
involved
in
concurrent
sentences?
unknown
speaker
45
so
that
get
us
down
of
1800,
is
that
it?
it
involves
concurrent
sentence?
unknown
speaker
but
1800
and
of
that
number
some
380
at
were
disposed
of
on
the
concurrent
sentence
doctrine.
unknown
speaker
this
is
in
the
federal
system?
unknown
speaker
to
show
that
it
was
error?
unknown
speaker
but
now
what
you're
--
well
now,
i
see.
so
you
may
--
you
are
making
the
same
argument
with
respect
to
constitutional
error.
unknown
speaker
how
can
you
say
that's
not
a
whole
conviction?
if
it's
a
conviction
the
judgment
will
sentence
on
a
count.
it's
a
whole
conviction
with
respect
to
that
particular
count.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
think
i
understand
you
now.
let
me
make
sure.
you
made
no
distinction
between
direct
appeal
and
collateral
attack,
that's
number
one.
number
two,
you
make
no
distinction
whether
it's
constitutional
error
or
a
statutory
error
or
some
of
them
are
constitutional
type
of
error.
in
any
of
those
situations,
the
government's
position
is
that
where
the
appeal
is
sought
from
judgment
imposing
concurrent
sentence
the
burden
should
be
on
the
appellant
or
the
petitioner
to
establish
that
there
are
practical
adverse
consequences
that
flow
from
the
concurrent
sentence
which
he
seeks
to
have
set
aside.
have
i
correctly
stated
your
position?
unknown
speaker
are
you
just
saying
--
unknown
speaker
you're
just
(voice
overlap)
the
whole
thing
up
is
a
discretionary
matter
then?
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that
but
you're
saying
that
we
can
have
a
different
rule
that
it
would
be
perfectly
appropriate
for
the
courts
to
adopt
a
different
rule
or
different
set
of
standings
and
one
of
the
situations
as
compared
with
the
others,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
you
make
these
distinctions
on
your
brief?
unknown
speaker
between
direct
appeal
collateral
attack
between
constitutional
claim
based
on
the
constitution
and
claim
based
on
the
non-constitutional
ground.
i
didn't
see
it
on
your
brief.
unknown
speaker
i
didn't
see
that
in
your
brief.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
know
whether
there
was
an
opinion,
has
it
gone
down
to
the
fourth
circuit?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
mr.
attorney
general
may
i
ask,
does
this
sort
of
thing
happen
in
maryland?
supposed
there
were
involve
here
two
burglaries?
unknown
speaker
two
burglaries,
separate
burglaries.
and
this
petitioner
had
been
tried
and
convicted
that
a
jury
in
one
week
of
one
of
them?
the
following
week
he
was
tried
and
convicted
by
another
jury
of
the
other.
but
sentence
was
imposed
in
--
on
both
convictions
on
the
same
day
and
they
were
both
10-year
sentences
and
they
were
to
run
concurrently.
in
that
circumstance,
does
your
state
court,
do
they
apply
the
--
unknown
speaker
they
do
not.
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
--
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
would
be
a
circumstance
where
you
would
support
there
ever
applying
the
concurrent
sentences?
unknown
speaker
you
think
you
would
support?
unknown
speaker
but
maryland
doesn't
use
the
rule
at
all
in
the
state
court.
unknown
speaker
the
concurrent
sentence.
unknown
speaker
on
--
your
courts
--
unknown
speaker
so
you
say
that
the
suggestion
you
had
from
your
opposition
that
maryland
does
not
apply
the
rule
at
all
that
was
wrong?
unknown
speaker
the
other
side
--
the
other
sentence?
unknown
speaker
it
may
perhaps
--
unknown
speaker
but
these
are
all
convictions
as
i
understand
that
i
like
to
be
clear
about
this?
under
your
practice
this
happens
only
in
the
case
of
convictions
by
the
same
jury
of
a
number
of
counts
at
a
single
trial?
unknown
speaker
mr.
burch,
do
you
have
any
knowledge
of
the
contrary?
unknown
speaker
i'm
not
talking
about
that.
i'm
talking
about
--
unknown
speaker
--
separate
trials,
in
separate
juries
but
concurrent
sentences
that
sort
of
thing.
unknown
speaker
why?
unknown
speaker
what
difference
is
that?
unknown
speaker
what?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
on
the
effects
of
a
recidivist
statute
(voice
overlap),
there
are
clearly
to
be
two
convictions.
unknown
speaker
how
about
if
it
was
just
a
general
sentence?
does
that
happen
very
often,
mr.
burch?
unknown
speaker
i
just
want
to
(voice
overlap).
unknown
speaker
but
in
this
very
case
i
just
wondered,
might
there
have
been
just
a
single
sentence
a
10
years
period.
unknown
speaker
but
mr.
attorney
general
to
what
--
under
maryland
law,
may
burglary
be
proved
without
proving
an
actual
larceny?
unknown
speaker
that's
all
you
have.
unknown
speaker
and
in
this
instance
then
the
--
it
was
the
evidence
of
the
larceny
which
pour
on
the
intent
to
steal
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
whatever.
unknown
speaker
well,
are
you
saying
then
that
the
any
consideration
on
release
date
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
he
was
also
convicted
of
larceny
would
be
inappropriate
and
improper
under
those
standards?
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
--
i
take
it
mr.
attorney
general
then
that's
it
implicit
in
your
argument
that
if
the
state
did
it
some
time
it
have
to
use
and
successfully
use
some
prior
conviction
which
had
not
been
reviewed
and
affirmed
because
of
the
concurrent
sentence
rule,
that
at
that
time
the
defendant
should
be
able
to
object
to
it.
unknown
speaker
i
think
you
--
let's
assume
the
state
did.
assume
the
state
did
some
time
base
on
which
state
not
maryland
base
the
recidivist
in
charge
on
the
fact
that
a
defendant
has
been
convicted
of
on
the
same
day
two
felonies
arising
out
of
the
same
transaction
and
the
count
of
that
is
two
felons
for
the
purposes
of
their
recidivist
statute.
and
one
of
them
had
never
been
reviewed
and
was
refused
to
review
because
of
the
concurrent
sentence
rule.
would
you
think
the
defendant
had
a
constitutional
right
at
that
point
to
object
to
the
use
of
that
against
him?
unknown
speaker
similarly,
similarly
if
you
were
--
if
somebody
attempted
to
impeach
him
with
this
evidence.
unknown
speaker
well,
yes
but
why
wouldn't
he
--
why
couldn't
he
say
you
may
not
even
mention
that
other
conviction
because
it
was
never
reviewed
and
was
never
affirmed.
i
was
deprived
of
my
review
of
that
conviction
because
of
the
concurrent
sentence
rule
therefore
the
state
may
not
if
the
state
wouldn't
review
it
for
its
own
convenience
that's
all,
wholly
convenience
and
therefore
he
could
never
be
able
to
use
it.
unknown
speaker
you're
saying
that
if
that
were
the
rule,
it
ought
to
be
applied
at
that
time.
unknown
speaker
rather
than
at
this
stage?
unknown
speaker
are
you
saying
with
that
argument,
i
don't
quite
understand
it.
do
you
mean
by
that,
that
you
are
saying
this
judgment
should
not
be
reversed
on
that
extent
but
that
if
a
time
should
come
some
court,
somewhere
else
or
even
here
by
some
adverse
disadvantages
would
have
been
impose
on
this
on
the
count
of
both
conviction,
he
should
be
allowed
to
show
it
then,
is
that
your
argument?
unknown
speaker
suppose
the
court
should
not
agree
with
you
on
this
point
and
should
hold
that
the
conviction
in
so
far
as
is
concerned
and
some
of
this
is
valid,
would
that
--
would
you
still
have
pending
before
us,
your
double
jeopardy
for
argument?
unknown
speaker
it'd
be
no
different
if
that
would
--
unknown
speaker
that
would
have
to
be
disposed
of,
wouldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
would
have
to
be
dispose
of,
whatever
ruling
we
took
on
this
one
i
believe
if
we
held
it
valid.
suppose
we
held
it
invalid
but
not
valid
but
not
invalid
as
to
this
case
as
a
valid
sentence,
then
would
your
former
jeopardy
case
--
argument
have
to
be
read?
unknown
speaker
well,
are
you
arguing
your
former
double
jeopardy
position.
unknown
speaker
now,
does
state
of
maryland
have
any
appeal
where
the
jury
acquits
a
man
of
a
crime?
unknown
speaker
but
they
do
not
or
the
jury
acquits?
unknown
speaker
and
who
acquitted
this
man?
unknown
speaker
mr.
strauss,
do
you
have
any
figures
that
indicate
how
many
criminal
appeals
were
disposed
of
on
concurrent
sentence
doctrine?
unknown
speaker
as
an
absolute
number,
what's
that
went
to?
unknown
speaker
as
an
absolute
figure,
what's
that
went
to?
unknown
speaker
as
i
say
3850
add
all
criminal
appeals
not
just
those
involved
in
concurrent
sentences.
unknown
speaker
yes,
how
many
--
unknown
speaker
and
how
many
of
the
total
number
of
the
criminal
appeals
involved

unknown

45
so
that

some

this
is

unknown

to

that
it

unknown

but
now
what
you're

now,
i
see.
so
you
may
--
you
are
making
the

with

how
can
you
say
that's

unknown
speaker
are
you
saying
with
that
argument,
i
don't
quite
understand
it.
do
you
mean
by
that,
that
you
are
saying
this
judgment
should
not
be
reversed
on
that
extent
but
that
if
a
time
should
come
some
court,
somewhere
else
or
even
here
by
some
adverse
disadvantages
would
have
been
impose
on
this
on
the
count
of
both
conviction,
he
should
be
allowed
to
show
it
then,
is
that
your
argument?
unknown
speaker
suppose
the
court
should
not
agree
with
you
on
this
point
and
should
hold
that
the
conviction
in
so
far
as
is
concerned
and
some
of
this
is
valid,
would
that
--
would
you
still
have
pending
before
us,
your
double
jeopardy
for
argument?
unknown
speaker
it'd
be
no
different
if
that
would
--
unknown
speaker
that
would
have
to
be
disposed
of,
wouldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
would
have
to
be
dispose
of,
whatever
ruling
we
took
on
this
one
i
believe
if
we
held
it
valid.
suppose
we
held
it
invalid
but
not
valid
but
not
invalid
as
to
this
case
as
a
valid
sentence,
then
would
your
former
jeopardy
case
--
argument
have
to
be
read?
unknown
speaker
well,
are
you
arguing
your
former
double
jeopardy
position.
unknown
speaker
now,
does
state

maryland
have
any
appeal
where
the

a
man
of
a
crime?
unknown
speaker
but
they
do
not
or

jury

unknown
speaker
