justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
borgerding,
did
i
understand
you
correctly
that
in
those
five
rules
of
different
things
that
the
defendant
could
do
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
could
waive
the
invalidity
of
the
indictment.
justice
thurgood
marshall
how,
under
the
sun,
can
you
waive
something
that's
null
and
void?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
mean,
it's
up
to
the
man
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
then
it's
not
null
and
void.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
then
his
acquittal
is
also
subject
to
be
voidable.
is
that
your
position?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
not
the
basis
of
the
acquittal.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
he
was
acquitted?
justice
thurgood
marshall
by
a
jury?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
so,
now,
he's
re-indicted
by
a
jury?
justice
thurgood
marshall
for
the
same
thing
he
was
acquitted
for.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
don't
see
double
jeopardy
at
all?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
would
happen
of
the
any
cases
in
maryland
where
juries
have
been
found
to
be
wrongly
constituted
on
other
grounds?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
lee
case
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
exclusion
of
negros.
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
alabama.
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
remember
that
one?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes,
well,
would
that
be
null
and
void?
justice
thurgood
marshall
or
that's
just
voidable?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
null
and
void?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
now,
if
we
have
a
hypothetical
case
where
a
man
is
convicted
of
burglary
and
acquitted
of
larceny,
and
has
found
that
one
of
the
jurors
was
a
felon
and,
therefore,
it
was
reversed.
you
would
retry
him
on
burglary
and
larceny,
would
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what's
different
in
that
case
and
this
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and,
did
it
also
have
jurisdiction
to
acquit?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
this
court
in
this
case
have
jurisdiction
to
acquit?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
was
never
in
jeopardy?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
was
just
in
jail?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
was
just
in
jail?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
never
in
jeopardy?
justice
thurgood
marshall
thank
you.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
cramer
what
possibility
is
there
that
the
state
has
overlooked?
you
said
they
negated
a
whole
lot
of
things
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
there's
something
they
didn't
negate,
what?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
if
no
change
in
legislation
and
etcetera,
etcetera,
etcetera,
in
the
future
somebody
thinks
ups
and
it
passes
no
that
he
will
be
harmed.
justice
thurgood
marshall
a
little
far-fetched?
justice
thurgood
marshall
a
little
far-fetched?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
let's
settle
it
might
be.
now
is
there
anything
else
that
they
have
failed
to
negate?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
are
they?
justice
thurgood
marshall
which
the
district
attorney
in
this
case
would
certify
that
this
man
was
convicted
of
burglary
and
larceny
in
a
single
trial
involved
in
the
same
evidence?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
think
that
would
prejudice?
justice
thurgood
marshall
possible?
justice
thurgood
marshall
anything
else?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
strauss.
justice
thurgood
marshall
supposed
you
had
two-count
conviction
with
two
witnesses.
one
for
each
count
and
concurrent
sentences
and
in
one
of
counts
the
witness
is
an
admitted
perjurer
and
that's
found
out
five
years
from
that,
what
under
the
sun
can
that
man
do
to
clear
his
record
off?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
in
this
2255,
what
would
he
get?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
served
in
a
concurrent
sentence
of
15
years
and
one
of
them
admittedly
bad.
justice
thurgood
marshall
two-count
indictment
tried
in
the
same
courtroom
at
the
same
time.
justice
thurgood
marshall
will
--
would
pass
the
appeal
stage
but
now
the
two
point
of
2255.
justice
thurgood
marshall
oh,
no
possibility.
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
start
with
a
bad
conviction?
justice
thurgood
marshall
an
unlawful
conviction.
justice
thurgood
marshall
oh,you
mean
well
--
that's
the
point
that
i
would
like
a
little
answer
to,
if
this
doesn't
affect
them
at
all
why
do
you
insist
on
defending
it?
you
say
the
fact
and
in
that
concurrent
sentence
it
doesn't
affect
him
at
all,
well
why
are
you
here
arguing?
justice
thurgood
marshall
was
the
attorney
general,
legal
stand
not
guilty
of
larceny
in
the
first
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
am
i
correct
that
there
is
no
way
under
the
suns
you
could
have
retried
him
on
that
count
if
he
had
used
his
right
to
give
a
new
trial?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
original
acquittal
you
could
never
agree
had
retried
him
after
he
was
acquitted
of
larceny.
justice
thurgood
marshall
except
if
the
new
trial
is
granted.
justice
thurgood
marshall
was
that
for
the
benefit
of
the
defendants?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
the
opportunity
was
given
was
to
get
five
more
years?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
he
really
had
a
temporary
acquittal?
justice
thurgood
marshall
a
conditional
acquittal?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
it
your
submission
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
it
your
submission
that
the
sentencing
judge
if
he's
in
doubt
as
to
legality
of
the
verdict,
he
may
set
a
concurrent
sentence
on
one
that
he
knows
is
good,
is
that
your
submission?
justice
thurgood
