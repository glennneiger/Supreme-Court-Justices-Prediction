justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you
said
he
was
re-indicted.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so,
he
wasn't
tried
under
the
original
indictment.
that
was
void,
wasn't
it,
under
the
schowgurow
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so,
he
was
tried
under
new
original
indictment,
wasn't
he?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
instantly,
are
you
raising
a
double
jeopardy
question
only
as
to
the
larceny
conviction?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
does
not
--
but,
you're
not
--
i
gather,
you're
not
arguing
that
the
second
burglary
conviction
has
to
be
set
aside
on
double
jeopardy
grounds.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
because
you
say
it
was
infected
by
the
trial
in
the
larceny
count.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
a
double
jeopardy
question?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why?
suppose
all
we
had
there
was
the
burglary
count.
suppose
that's
all
we
had,
just
the
burglary
count.
on
your
double
jeopardy
argument,
would
you
be
entitled
to
a
new
trial
or
just
to
a
sentence
of
not
more
than
10
years?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
had
he
been
prosecuted
only
for
burglary
the
second
time
and
got,
as
he
did,
15
instead
of
10
years
as
he
did
the
first
time.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and,
your
double
jeopardy
argument
founded
on
patton
prevailed.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
then
what
would
you
be
entitled,
a
new
trial
of
the
burglary
count
or
only
a
new
sentence?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
aren't
you
really
arguing
that
because
of
all
this
a
void
indictment
first
void
--
a
void
first
indictment
that
jeopardy
never
attached
under
that
indictment?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
those
are
your
argument?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
even
though
he
went
all
through
a
trial,
all
through
appeal,
and
everything
else
for
the
purpose
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause,
that
all
proceeding
was
one
in
which
jeopardy
never
attached?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
do,
too.
looking
at
pages
21,
it
was
probably
the
first
step
in
which
the
accused
is
to
be
brought
to
the
trial
court
with
counsel
present.
now,
you
tell
us
that'
what
happened.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
alright,
just
a
moment.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
then
it
says,
“to
ascertain
whether
he
desires
to
avail
himself
of
the
relief
afforded
by
the
rulings
or
whether
he
elects
to
waive
any
objections
now
available
to
him.”
now,
was
there
any
transcript
made
of
that
proceeding?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so,
we
have
no
way
of
knowing
what
actually
happened
when
he
was
brought
into
the
trial
court
with
his
counsel
present.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
alright,
so
we
have
no
way,
actually,
to
know
what
happened
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
we
have
no
transcript.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
doesn't
make
any
sense
that
he
would've
gone
in
on
--
under
your
step
one
and
have
said
“now,
please
set
aside
that
indictment
for
larceny
under
schowgurow
so
that
i
could
be
retried
for
larceny
even
though
i
was
acquitted.”
does
that
make
sense?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
that
make
sense?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
in
that
sense,
and
you
call
that
an
intelligent-free
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
you're
tell
in
the
brief
this,
on
the
record
was
the
intelligent,
knowing,
and
formal
choice
or
at
least
it
was
with
the
housebreaking
question.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
say
in
your
brief
at
page
22
that
this,
on
the
record,
and
so
as
the
rest
of
it,
was
an
intelligent,
knowing,
and
formal
choice
made
with
the
understanding
and
agreement
that
the
original
indictment
on
the
burglary
that
he
could
be
re-indictment
and,
upon
reconviction,
he
might
receive
a
new
sentence
in
which
he
could
not
received
otherwise.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
know,
but
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
just
in
the
record,
what
happened
in
the
new
trial?
are
you
really
urging
on
us
that
he
made
an
intelligent,
knowing,
and
formal
choice
to
be
retried
on
the
housebreaking
in
the
first
offense?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
the
15-year
sentence
more
than
likely
what
the
state
tells
us
about
the
habeas
corpus?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know
but
there's
no
understanding
the
15-year
sentence
because
the
case
is
now
here.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
issue
before
us?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you
