mr.
cramer.
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
what
language
did
it
leave
it
open,
if
you
have
it
there
before
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
borgerding.
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
do
you
find
his
position
stated
in
the
record?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
on
what
page?
i'd
just
like
to
get
his
answer.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but,
i
read
over
on
page
4,
though,
where
he
says
“it
is
the
position
of
the
defendant
that
the
housebreaking
and
larceny
counts,
the
second
and
third
respectively,
of
this
indictment
should
be
dismissed,
should
be
a
bar
in
jeopardy
as
in
regards
to
the
present
prosecution
on
those
counts,
and
that
is
our
motion.”
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
do
you
concede
this
portion
of
his
motion,
that
the
housebreaking
and
larceny
counts,
the
second
and
third
respectively,
of
this
indictment
should
be
dismissed,
should
be
a
bar
in
jeopardy
as
in
regards
to
present
prosecution
on
those
counts
and
that
is
our
motion,
do
you
agree
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
when
is
a
verdict
of
not
guilty
final?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
the
man
doesn't
ordinarily
appeal
a
verdict
of
not
guilty,
does
he?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
when
was
the
verdict
of
not
guilty
on
the
larceny
count
final
in
this
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright.
well,
then,
if
he
takes
an
appeal
from
the
rest
of
the
judgment,
how
does
he
vitiate
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
didn't
raise
that
before
he
was
on
that
really
on
the
larceny
count,
did
he?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
no
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
i'm
assuming
when
he
was
first
found
not
guilty.
he
--
that
was
final,
wasn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
mean
that,
in
any
case,
that
if
a
man
is
acquitted
by
a
jury
and
his
indictment,
the
indictment
that
he
had
to
see
was
not
lawfully
drawn
that
there
is
no
jeopardy?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
wonder
if
this
colloquy
that
begins
on
page
3
shouldn't
settle
the
matter
and
due
to
the
fact
that
there
is
no
transcript
on
what
happened
at
the
earlier
date.
mr.
o'maley:
“your
honor,
may
we
approach
the
bench?”
the
court:
“yes.”
whereupon,
counsel
approached
the
bench
and
the
following
proceedings
were
had
out
of
the
hearing
of
the
perspective
jury.
mr.
o'maley:
“your
honor,
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
defendant
is
now
charged
of
the
crimes
of
burglary,
housebreaking,
and
larceny.
that,
in
previous
time,
he
was
found
not
guilty
of
the
housebreaking
and
larceny.
he
was
found
guilty
of
common
law
burglary.
the
common
law
burglary
was
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals
and,
while
pending,
by
virtue
of
the
schowgurow
decision,
it
was
remanded
to
this
court,
at
which
time
the
defendant
elected
to
have
a
retrial.
it
is
the
position
of
the
defendant
that
the
housebreaking
and
larceny
counts,
the
second
and
third
respectively
of
this
indictment,
should
be
dismissed,
should
be
a
bar
in
jeopardy
as
in
regards
to
the
present
prosecution
on
those
counts
and
that
is
our
motion.”
now,
that's
the
only
thing
that
i
see
in
this
transcript,
and
shouldn't
that
be
determinative
of
what
the
defendant
sought
in
this
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
said
“all
i'm
appealing
while
my
--
all
i'm
appealing
is
this
question
of
--
the
question
of
this
double
jeopardy
on
the
larceny
and
on
the
housebreaking.”
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
make
that
final
statement
that
you
will.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
cramer?
chief
justice
earl
warren
number
201,
john
dalmer
benton,
petitioner
versus
maryland.
mr.
cramer.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
cramer,
do
you
happen
to
know
if
any
of
the
states
that
have
recidivist
statutes
would
consider
these
two
convictions
in
this
case
as
separate
convictions
for
the
purpose
of
establishing
recidivism?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
strauss.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
mr.
strauss,
could
in
any
of
the
states
where
they
have
recidivist
clause,
these
two
convictions
be
used
to
prove
recidivism?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
--
no,
well,
all
right,
if
they
could?
chief
justice
earl
warren
let
me
ask
you
this.
suppose
this
had
been
a
larceny
independent
of
this
particular
offense,
the
burglary
and
he's
convicted
and
sentenced
that
he
was
here.
could
that
be
used
as
a
recidivist
offense?
chief
justice
earl
warren
are
you
sure
that
they
all
do
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
how
would
a
court
know
25
years
after
the
fact
whether
this
larceny
and
this
burglary
were
a
part
of
the
same
transaction
if
they
were
in
the
state
charging
prior
convictions?
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
have
to
go
back
and
review
all
these
cases
and
determine
whether
they
were
connected
in
fact
or
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
as
you
know,
many
of
these
old
records
are
destroyed
and
are
otherwise
--
are
lost?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yeah.
well,
that
might
be
but
should
have
the
conviction
of
the
two
offenses
and
some
district
attorney
and
some
state
will
charge
as
one
offense,
had
he
been
convicted
of
burglary?
and
as
a
second
offense
that
he'd
been
convicted
of
larceny,
and
how
would
you
go
back
and
prove
that
they
were
all
part
of
one
offense?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
prefer
to
say
that
that's
true
even
though
they
were
entirely
separate
in
distinct
crimes,
are
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
any
constitutional
reason
why
the
state
could
not
do
what
i
have
just
suggested?
charged
him
with
being
a
recidivist
because
he
was
convicted
on
the
number
of
cases
at
one
--
in
one
particular
trial,
suppose
there
was
(inaudible)
crimes
that
continued
over
a
period
of
a
year
or
two
and
they
tried
him
for
a
dozen
and
convicted
him
on
each
trial
in
separate.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
know
but
would
it
affect
the
constitution
for
him
to
do
that
and
if
it
doesn't
how
can
we
say
that
it
will
not
be
done
to
the
prejudice
of
a
defendant
when
this
happens?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
will
be
remote
for
everybody
except
the
man
who's
involved?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
he'd
have
to
go
back
25
years
maybe
to
establish
that
that
was
a
situation.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
but
there's
a
little
difference
between
the
power
of
the
state
and
the
power
of
an
individual
particularly
an
indigent
one
to
prove
such
things,
isn't
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
know
but
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
it
your
position
that
the
burden
is
on
the
state
or
on
the
prisoner
to
prove
such
thing?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
for
the
state,
is
it
the
burden
of
the
state
to
prove
that
he
was
not
injured
by
this,
this
double
punishment
or
is
it
the
burden
of
the
defendant
to
prove
that
he
was?
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
this
case,
the
burden
would
be
on
the
government
to
prove
that
there
is
no
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
no
it
doesn't.
it
isn't
but
we're
dealing
with
what
it
might
lead
to,
are
we
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
not
interested
in
just
the
maryland
law,
we're
interested
in
what
can
happen
all
over
the
country
because
in
other
parts
of
the
country,
they
can
charge
him
with
recidivism
under
the
spencer
case
and
all
they
got
to
do
is
prove
that
he's
been
convicted
twice
or
so
and
then
he
goes
penitentiary
for
his
natural
life.
chief
justice
earl
warren
let
me
ask
you
just
one
other
question,
supposed
a
man
in
a
position
of
this
petitioner
should
take
the
stand
as
a
witness
either
in
his
own
behalf
or
in
behalf
of
someone
else
and
another
jurisdiction
and
he
was
asked
the
question,
“have
you
ever
been
convicted
of
felony?”
and
he
says
“yes.”
“and
you
were
convicted
of
burglary,
weren't
you?”
“yes.”
“you
were
also
convicted
of
larceny,
weren't
you?”
do
you
not
think
that
would
be
worse
than
to
have
a
man
merely
admit
that
he
was
convicted
of
burglary?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
haven't
had
that
much
experience
because
they
don't
do
it
that
way.
i
know
it
from
some
experience.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
ask
him,
“have
you
ever
been
convicted
of
a
felony?”
“yes.”
“were
you
convicted
of
burglary
and
such
and
such
a
crime?”
“yes,
i
was.”
“were
you
ever
been
convicted
of
larceny
in
that
same
court?”
and
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
that
wouldn't
have
some
effect
on
a
jury,
on
the
credibility
of
this
man?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
now
who's
going
to
tell?
chief
justice
earl
warren
can
they
go
in
and
try
those
sayings
on
such
a
collateral
matter?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
all
they
have
to
prove
is
the
commitment
and
they've
got
the
commitment
there.
they
can't
go
behind
that
from
trial
and
such
issues
of
that
collateral
matter
as
far
as
i
know.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
attorney
general.
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
the
court
write
an
opinion
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
the
court
write
an
opinion
in
that
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
can
i
ask
what
the
--
what
the
reason
for
the
reduction
of
the
set?
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
your
position
--
what's
your
position
here?
that's
your
position
here,
you
say
that's
a
sound
position
for
the
state
to
take?
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
do
we
find
that
in
the
record?
chief
justice
earl
warren
general,
let
me
ask
you
this
question.
assume
that
we
could
start
afresh
now
without
any
consideration
of
your
backlogs
or
what
backlogs
would
be
–
with
eventual
aid
in
the
event
of
taking
into
consideration
all
the
cases
that
have
been
handled
in
this
manner.
what
is
a
great
interest
in
the
state?
and
what
--
how
would
the
state
be
hurt
by
not
attacking
on
this
penalty
that
you
say
doesn't
injure
the
defendant
in
anyway
and
i
don't
know
how
it
is
going
to
help
the
state
to
do
it?
why
should
we
have
all
this
difficulty
and
all
this
argument
about
something
unless
it's
a
real
vital
interest
of
the
state
involved?
if
a
man
is
going
to
do
10
years,
why
shouldn't
he
do
10
years
on
the
case
that
he's
clearly
guilty
of
and
not
have
this
underlying
current
going
on
all
the
time?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
are
they?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
are
they
though?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
general,
do
you
think
the
views
of
the
district
attorney
as
you
lead
them
out
should
be
important
state
interest
where
they
say,
well
maybe
we
haven't
much
of
a
case
on
housebreaking
and
maybe
we
haven't
very
strong
case
on
burglary
and
probably
we
haven't
got
much
on
larceny.
but
if
we
throw
them
all
together
and
put
in
testimony
on
all
of
them
but
maybe
the
sum
will
be
greater
than
the
parts
and
therefore
they'll
convict
them
on
all
three
and
we'll
sustain
them
--
we'll
sustain
all
three
convictions
for
any
sentence
that
the
judge
might
want
to
give
on
all
three
of
them
that
he
can
pick
out
of
the
whole
situation
enough
to
convict
on
one
of
the
counts.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that's
one
thing
but
does
society
have
the
right
to
say
that
if
there
is
evidence
--
sufficient
evidence
in
there
to
convict
under
one
theory
and
the
jury
finds
him
guilty
of
both
and
that
one
of
them
cannot
be
sustained
but
still
both
of
them
should
be
sustained
because
one
of
them
can
be.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
let
me
ask
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
let
me
--
i
just
ask
you
one
question
i
asked
of
mr.
strauss.
suppose
this
man
10
years
from
now
in
another
jurisdiction
wants
to
take
the
stand
as
a
witness,
he
therefore
himself
or
for
someone
else
and
he
has
ask,
“have
you
ever
been
convicted
of
a
felony?”
“yes.”
“have
you
ever
been
convicted
of
burglary?”
“i
have.”
“have
you
ever
been
convicted
of
larceny?”
do
you
not
think
that
the
conviction
on
both
of
those
would
discredit
him
more
than
if
he
only
had
to
say
i
was
convicted
one
offense?
chief
justice
earl
warren
maybe
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
i
think
it's
done
everyday.
we'll
recess
now.
mr.
attorney
general,
you
may
continue
with
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
cramer.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mister
--
thank
you.
mr.
attorney
general
would
you
mind
sending
us
copies
of
the
opinion
of
the
district
court
that's
all
we
need,
we
don't
need
any
further
argument
on
it.
just
send
us
a
copy.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
know
but
we'd
like
to
see
--
we'd
like
to
see
the
opinion.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
you
may.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
chief
justice
earl
warren
number
201,
john
dalmer
benton,
petitioner,
versus
maryland.
mr.
cramer.
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
what
language
did
it
leave
it
open,
if
you
have
it
there
before
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
borgerding.
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
do
you
find
his
position
stated
in
the
record?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
on
what
page?
i'd
just
like
to
get
his
answer.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but,
i
read
over
on
page
4,
though,
where
he
says
“it
is
the
position
of
the
defendant
that
the
housebreaking
and
larceny
counts,
the
second
and
third
respectively,
of
this
indictment
should
be
dismissed,
should
be
a
bar
in
jeopardy
as
in
regards
to
the
present
prosecution
on
those
counts,
and
that
is
our
motion.”
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
do
you
concede
this
portion
of
his
motion,
that
the
housebreaking
and
larceny
counts,
the
second
and
third
respectively,
of
this
indictment
should
be
dismissed,
should
be
a
bar
in
jeopardy
as
in
regards
to
present
prosecution
on
those
counts
and
that
is
our
motion,
do
you
agree
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
when
is
a
verdict
of
not
guilty
final?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
the
man
doesn't
ordinarily
appeal
a
verdict
of
not
guilty,
does
he?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
when
was
the
verdict
of
not
guilty
on
the
larceny
count
final
in
this
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright.
well,
then,
if
he
takes
an
appeal
from
the
rest
of
the
judgment,
how
does
he
vitiate
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
didn't
raise
that
before
he
was
on
that
really
on
the
larceny
count,
did
he?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
no
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
i'm
assuming
when
he
was
first
found
not
guilty.
he
--
that
was
final,
wasn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
mean
that,
in
any
case,
that
if
a
man
is
acquitted
by
a
jury
and
his
indictment,
the
indictment
that
he
had
to
see
was
not
lawfully
drawn
that
there
is
no
jeopardy?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
wonder
if
this
colloquy
that
begins
on
page
3
shouldn't
settle
the
matter
and
due
to
the
fact
that
there
is
no
transcript
on
what
happened
at
the
earlier
date.
mr.
o'maley:
“your
honor,
may
we
approach
the
bench?”
the
court:
“yes.”
whereupon,
counsel
approached
the
bench
and
the
following
proceedings
were
had
out
of
the
hearing
of
the
perspective
jury.
mr.
o'maley:
“your
honor,
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
defendant
is
now
charged
of
the
crimes
of
burglary,
housebreaking,
and
larceny.
that,
in
previous
time,
he
was
found
not
guilty
of
the
housebreaking
and
larceny.
he
was
found
guilty
of
common
law
burglary.
the
common
law
burglary
was
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals
and,
while
pending,
by
virtue
of
the
schowgurow
decision,
it
was
remanded
to
this
court,
at
which
time
the
defendant
elected
to
have
a
retrial.
it
is
the
position
of
the
defendant
that
the
housebreaking
and
larceny
counts,
the
second
and
third
respectively
of
this
indictment,
should
be
dismissed,
should
be
a
bar
in
jeopardy
as
in
regards
to
the
present
prosecution
on
those
counts
and
that
is
our
motion.”
now,
that's
the
only
thing
that
i
see
in
this
transcript,
and
shouldn't
that
be
determinative
of
what
the
defendant
sought
in
this
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
said
“all
i'm
appealing
while
my
--
all
i'm
appealing
is
this
question
of
--
the
question
of
this
double
jeopardy
on
the
larceny
and
on
the
housebreaking.”
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
make
that
final
statement
that
you
will.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
cramer?
chief
justice
earl
warren
number
201,
john
dalmer
benton,
petitioner
versus
maryland.
mr.
cramer.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
cramer,
do
you
happen
to
know
if
any
of
the
states
that
have
recidivist
statutes
would
consider
these
two
convictions
in
this
case
as
separate
convictions
for
the
purpose
of
establishing
recidivism?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
strauss.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
mr.
strauss,
could
in
any
of
the
states
where
they
have
recidivist
clause,
these
two
convictions
be
used
to
prove
recidivism?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
--
no,
well,
all
right,
if
they
could?
chief
justice
earl
warren
let
me
ask
you
this.
suppose
this
had
been
a
larceny
independent
of
this
particular
offense,
the
burglary
and
he's
convicted
and
sentenced
that
he
was
here.
could
that
be
used
as
a
recidivist
offense?
chief
justice
earl
warren
are
you
sure
that
they
all
do
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
how
would
a
court
know
25
years
after
the
fact
whether
this
larceny
and
this
burglary
were
a
part
of
the
same
transaction
if
they
were
in
the
state
charging
prior
convictions?
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
have
to
go
back
and
review
all
these
cases
and
determine
whether
they
were
connected
in
fact
or
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
as
you
know,
many
of
these
old
records
are
destroyed
and
are
otherwise
--
are
lost?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yeah.
well,
that
might
be
but
should
have
the
conviction
of
the
two
offenses
and
some
district
attorney
and
some
state
will
charge
as
one
offense,
had
he
been
convicted
of
burglary?
and
as
a
second
offense
that
he'd
been
convicted
of
larceny,
and
how
would
you
go
back
and
prove
that
they
were
all
part
of
one
offense?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
prefer
to
say
that
that's
true
even
though
they
were
entirely
separate
in
distinct
crimes,
are
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
any
constitutional
reason
why
the
state
could
not
do
what
i
have
just
suggested?
charged
him
with
being
a
recidivist
because
he
was
convicted
on
the
number
of
cases
at
one
--
in
one
particular
trial,
suppose
there
was
(inaudible)
crimes
that
continued
over
a
period
of
a
year
or
two
and
they
tried
him
for
a
dozen
and
convicted
him
on
each
trial
in
separate.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
know
but
would
it
affect
the
constitution
for
him
to
do
that
and
if
it
doesn't
how
can
we
say
that
it
will
not
be
done
to
the
prejudice
of
a
defendant
when
this
happens?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
will
be
remote
for
everybody
except
the
man
who's
involved?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
he'd
have
to
go
back
25
years
maybe
to
establish
that
that
was
a
situation.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
but
there's
a
little
difference
between
the
power
of
the
state
and
the
power
of
an
individual
particularly
an
indigent
one
to
prove
such
things,
isn't
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
know
but
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
it
your
position
that
the
burden
is
on
the
state
or
on
the
prisoner
to
prove
such
thing?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
for
the
state,
is
it
the
burden
of
the
state
to
prove
that
he
was
not
injured
by
this,
this
double
punishment
or
is
it
the
burden
of
the
defendant
to
prove
that
he
was?
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
this
case,
the
burden
would
be
on
the
government
to
prove
that
there
is
no
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
no
it
doesn't.
it
isn't
but
we're
dealing
with
what
it
might
lead
to,
are
we
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
not
interested
in
just
the
maryland
law,
we're
interested
in
what
can
happen
all
over
the
country
because
in
other
parts
of
the
country,
they
can
charge
him
with
recidivism
under
the
spencer
case
and
all
they
got
to
do
is
prove
that
he's
been
convicted
twice
or
so
and
then
he
goes
penitentiary
for
his
natural
life.
chief
justice
earl
warren
let
me
ask
you
just
one
other
question,
supposed
a
man
in
a
position
of
this
petitioner
should
take
the
stand
as
a
witness
either
in
his
own
behalf
or
in
behalf
of
someone
else
and
another
jurisdiction
and
he
was
asked
the
question,
“have
you
ever
been
convicted
of
felony?”
and
he
says
“yes.”
“and
you
were
convicted
of
burglary,
weren't
you?”
“yes.”
“you
were
also
convicted
of
larceny,
weren't
you?”
do
you
not
think
that
would
be
worse
than
to
have
a
man
merely
admit
that
he
was
convicted
of
burglary?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
haven't
had
that
much
experience
because
they
don't
do
it
that
way.
i
know
it
from
some
experience.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
ask
him,
“have
you
ever
been
convicted
of
a
felony?”
“yes.”
“were
you
convicted
of
burglary
and
such
and
such
a
crime?”
“yes,
i
was.”
“were
you
ever
been
convicted
of
larceny
in
that
same
court?”
and
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
that
wouldn't
have
some
effect
on
a
jury,
on
the
credibility
of
this
man?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
now
who's
going
to
tell?
chief
justice
earl
warren
can
they
go
in
and
try
those
sayings
on
such
a
collateral
matter?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
all
they
have
to
prove
is
the
commitment
and
they've
got
the
commitment
there.
they
can't
go
behind
that
from
trial
and
such
issues
of
that
collateral
matter
as
far
as
i
know.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
attorney
general.
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
the
court
write
an
opinion
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
the
court
write
an
opinion
in
that
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
can
i
ask
what
the
--
what
the
reason
for
the
reduction
of
the
set?
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
your
position
--
what's
your
position
here?
that's
your
position
here,
you
say
that's
a
sound
position
for
the
state
to
take?
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
do
we
find
that
in
the
record?
chief
justice
earl
warren
general,
let
me
ask
you
this
question.
assume
that
we
could
start
afresh
now
without
any
consideration
of
your
backlogs
or
what
backlogs
would
be
–
with
eventual
aid
in
the
event
of
taking
into
consideration
all
the
cases
that
have
been
handled
in
this
manner.
what
is
a
great
interest
in
the
state?
and
what
--
how
would
the
state
be
hurt
by
not
attacking
on
this
penalty
that
you
say
doesn't
injure
the
defendant
in
anyway
and
i
don't
know
how
it
is
going
to
help
the
state
to
do
it?
why
should
we
have
all
this
difficulty
and
all
this
argument
about
something
unless
it's
a
real
vital
interest
of
the
state
involved?
if
a
man
is
going
to
do
10
years,
why
shouldn't
he
do
10
years
on
the
case
that
he's
clearly
guilty
of
and
not
have
this
underlying
current
going
on
all
the
time?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
are
they?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
are
they
though?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
general,
do
you
think
the
views
of
the
district
attorney
as
you
lead
them
out
should
be
important
state
interest
where
they
say,
well
maybe
we
haven't
much
of
a
case
on
housebreaking
and
maybe
we
haven't
very
strong
case
on
burglary
and
probably
we
haven't
got
much
on
larceny.
but
if
we
throw
them
all
together
and
put
in
testimony
on
all
of
them
but
maybe
the
sum
will
be
greater
than
the
parts
and
therefore
they'll
convict
them
on
all
three
and
we'll
sustain
them
--
we'll
sustain
all
three
convictions
for
any
sentence
that
the
judge
might
want
to
give
on
all
three
of
them
that
he
can
pick
out
of
the
whole
situation
enough
to
convict
on
one
of
the
counts.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that's
one
thing
but
does
society
have
the
right
to
say
that
if
there
is
evidence
--
sufficient
evidence
in
there
to
convict
under
one
theory
and
the
jury
finds
him
guilty
of
both
and
that
one
of
them
cannot
be
sustained
but
still
both
of
them
should
be
sustained
because
one
of
them
can
be.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
let
me
ask
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
let
me
--
i
just
ask
you
one
question
i
asked
of
mr.
strauss.
suppose
this
man
10
years
from
now
in
another
jurisdiction
wants
to
take
the
stand
as
a
witness,
he
therefore
himself
or
for
someone
else
and
he
has
ask,
“have
you
ever
been
convicted
of
a
felony?”
“yes.”
“have
you
ever
been
convicted
of
burglary?”
“i
have.”
“have
you
ever
been
convicted
of
larceny?”
do
you
not
think
that
the
conviction
on
both
of
those
would
discredit
him
more
than
if
he
only
had
to
say
i
was
convicted
one
offense?
chief
justice
earl
warren
maybe
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
i
think
it's
done
everyday.
we'll
recess
now.
mr.
attorney
general,
you
may
continue
with
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
cramer.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mister
--
thank
you.
mr.
attorney
general
would
you
mind
sending
us
copies
of
the
opinion
of
the
district
court
that's
all
we
need,
we
don't
need
any
further
argument
on
it.
just
send
us
a
copy.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
know
but
we'd
like
to
see
--
we'd
like
to
see
the
opinion.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
you
may.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
