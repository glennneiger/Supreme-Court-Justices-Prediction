mr.
francis
b.
burch
mr.
chief
justice,
mr.
justices
--
mr.
francis
b.
burch
--
may
it
please
your
honors.
if
i
may
i'd
like
to
address
myself
to
some
of
the
opening
remarks
made
by
mr.
cramer.
i
think
he
probably
unintentionally
overlooked
pointing
out
to
the
court
that
with
respect
to
the
increase
of
penalty
on
the
second
trial
for
burglary
from
10
years
to
15
years
that
this
is
a
matter
of
a
separate
proceeding
before
the
united
states
district
court
in
maryland.
the
matter
has
been
decided.
the
federal
court
has
directed
that
the
sentence
be
reduced
to
10
years.
it
is
on
appeal
to
the
circuit
court
for
the
fourth
circuit
and
being
held
by
the
circuit
court
for
the
fourth
circuit
pending
the
outcome
of
this
proceeding
and
i
thought
that
it
is
important
that
the
court
be
apprised
of
the
fact
that
as
far
as
that
10-year,
15-year
aspect
to
the
matter
is
concerned
it
has
been
adjudicated
and
that
of
itself
is
on
appeal.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
excuse
me,
sir?
mr.
francis
b.
burch
they
granted
a
--
your
honor,
they
granted
--
district
court
did
write
an
opinion
in
that
case.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
on
the
theory
of
double
jeopardy
that
by
increasing
the
penalty
that
it
was
in
the
nature
of
double
jeopardy
and
therefore
it
should
not
have
been
permitted
to
increase
the
penalty
under
the
patton
case.
mr.
cramer
has
pointed
out
that
it
was
prejudicial
to
try
the
larceny
case
in
the
second
trial
about
the
burglary
case
because
the
larceny
case
under
his
interpretation
or
theory
of
the
case
was
in
fact
a
double
jeopardy
proceeding.
i
might
point
out
that
this
would
be
true
with
respect
to
any
account
that
was
held
to
be
invalid
if
there
was,
there
were
five
counts
and
one
was
good
and
four
were
held
to
be
invalid,
you
could
say
that
trying
the
one
good
count
with
the
four
invalid
counts
would
effect
the
one
good
one
and
consequently
that
the
one
good
count
should
be
thrown
out
and
i
don't
believe
that
any
of
the
cases
hold
to
that
effect.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
in
the
first
case.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
i'm
not
sure
i
quite
understood
your
question,
mr.
justice.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
that's
correct.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
that's
correct
but
in
this
particular
case
because
of
the
schowgurow
case
and
his
having
in
the
schowgurow
case
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
all
indictments
by
grand
juries
who
were
required
to
profess
their
belief
in
god
were
invalid.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
and
he
was
given
the
opportunity.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
the
opportunity
was
given
him
to
get
the
advice
of
counsel
to
decide
whether
he
wanted
the
first
indictment
sustain
and
to
pursue
his
appeal
that
was
the
intending
in
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland
whether
he
wanted
to
stand
under
a
new
indictment
which
would
have
been
included
the
same
counts
as
the
original
indictment.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
he
had
an
acquittal
in
the
first
--
mr.
francis
b.
burch
--
case
but
the
court
held
that
he
had
waived
and
i
know
this
was
all
argued
that
the
previous
hearing
that
he
had
waived
any
of
the
rights
he
had
under
the
first
series
of
indictments
in
the
counsel
because
that
was
stricken
out
the
first
indictment,
everything
fell
with
it.
and
therefore
he
was
to
stand
trial
as
there
where
a
new
trial
to
begin
with
in
the
first
instance.
if
your
honor
mr.
chief
justice
say
in
the
sibron
case
--
mr.
francis
b.
burch
we
take
the
position
that
under
the
waiver
which
was
signed
and
if
your
honors
are
interested
on
the
position
to
read
to
you
the
actual
proceedings
that
at
the
time
of
the
second
indictment
when
he
was
apprised
with
counsel
present
as
to
exactly
what
the
situation
was,
as
to
fact
that
he
might
receive
an
increase
sentence
do
i
have
that
if
you
please?
mr.
francis
b.
burch
well,
the
issue
was
never
raise
up
until
the
point
was
reached
here
at
the
time
of
argument
and
we
therefore
do
not
have
it
in
the
record
because
it
was
never
raise
by
the
petitioner
below.
but
if
i
may,
i
would
like
--
the
court
have
thoroughly
explained
to
him
and
this
is
the
court
now
at
the
time
about
the
second
indictment
as
pressing
the
remark
now
to
counsel
for
the
defendant.
“have
you
thoroughly
explained
to
him
and
do
you
understand
all
of
the
prevision
of
the
schowgurow
case?”
mr.
o'malley:
“yes,
sir.”
the
court:
“you
have
thoroughly
explained
to
him
all
aspects
of
it?”
the
court:
“that
he
is
not
required
in
any
manner
to
waive
his
original
trial
or
appeal,
he
may
allow
his
appeal
to
stand
you
have
explain
that
him?”
mr.
o'malley:
“he
can
allow
his
appeal
to
stand
and
waive
a
new
trial,
yes
sir.”
the
court:
“in
the
court
of
appeals?”
mr.
o'malley:
“he
can.
i
have
explained
to
him
that
he
can
elect
to
proceed
on
his
present
appeal
or
in
the
alternative
he
can
ask
to
be
tried
anew
with
a
new
indictment.”
the
court:
“and
what
has
been
his
choice?”
mr.
o'malley:
“his
choice
is
to
have
a
new
trial.”
the
court:
“new
trial?
now
does
he
fully
understand
and
i
direct
my
remarks
directly
to
you,
benton,
do
you
fully
understand
that
she
will
be
tried
again
and
if
found
guilty
you
could
get
a
greater
sentence?”
the
defendant:
“yes,
sir.”
the
court:
“and
it
would
be
no
inference
in
any
manner
that
in
any
time
that
you
have
put
in
thus
far
would
be
credited
towards
that
sentence?”
“yes,
sir.”
“do
you
understand
that?”
the
court:
“very
well,
under
the
facts
developed
at
this
particular
hearing
the
court
awards
you
a
new
trial.
now,
do
i
understand
his
been
arraigned
under
the
entry
of
the
clerk?”
“yes,
your
honor.”
then
they
proceeded
to
the
arraignment.
and
the
clerk:
“you
have
been
indicted
by
the
grand
jury
for
prince
george's
county
on
the
charge
of
burglary,
common
law
housebreaking
and
larceny.
and
mr.
o'malley:
“as
your
attorney
in
this
case,
yes
or
not,
do
you
plead
in
this
case
guilty
or
not
guilty?”
the
defendant:
“not
guilty.”
“how
do
you
elect
to
have
this
case
tried,
by
the
court
or
by
jury?”
the
defendant:
“by
jury.”
mr.
francis
b.
burch
now,
the
court:
“very
well
are
you
in
jail
at
the
moment?”
“no
sir,
i
am
on
bond.”
he
was
on
bond
so
was
the
question
if
your
honor
please
of
there
being
any
credit
given
for
the
time
that
he
spend
in
jail
because
he
was
on
bond.
he
had
not
spend
any
time
in
jail?
mr.
francis
b.
burch
it's
correct
sir.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
actually
it
was
never
set
aside
because
his
appeal
was
in
process
and
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland
gave
the
opportunity
to
all
those
--
mr.
francis
b.
burch
--
who's
cases
are
not
been
concluded
--
mr.
francis
b.
burch
to
ask
for
new
trials.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
that's
correct.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
that's
correct.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
of
maryland.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
directly
that
the
sentence
be
reduced
from
15
years
to
10
years
on
the
burglary
count.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
that's
correct.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
i
don't
know
that
it
would
have
any
connection
with
the
harmless
error
on
the
concurrent
sentence
because
it
makes
no
different
whether
the
sentence
on
the
burglary
is
15
years
or
10
years
in
so
far
as
the
5-year
concurrent
larceny
is
concerned.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
they're
still
served
together.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
and
they'll
be
allowed
for
parole
--
for
parole
at
the
--
after
you
serve
25%
less
good
time
on
the
10-year
sentence
assuming
that
that's
what
the
ultimate
disposition
is
at
the
federal
level.
mr.
chief
justice,
in
sibron,
i
believe
that
you
made
the
observation
that
you
thought
that
the
pollard
has
in
effect
created
a
presumption
of
collateral
consequence
and
that
the
burden
was
therefore
on
the
state
to
prove
that
there
was
no
collateral
consequence.
and
i
have
read
the
pollard,
and
quite
frankly
i
see
nothing
in
the
opinion
itself
which
directs
itself
to
the
question
of
presumptions
under
one
hand
or
burden
on
the
other.
there
is
just
a
very
short
paragraph
in
there
in
which
the
court
says
that
there
appears
to
be
substantial
likelihood
of
collateral
consequences
in
so
far
as
the
defendant
and
in
that
case
was
concerned.
and
it
may
well
be
that
the
record
of
the
case
would
disclose
that
in
fact
there
were
some
significant
collateral
consequences
on
the
face
that
would
be
--
that
the
defendant
himself
might
have
suffer
if
the
conviction
were
allowed
to
stand
and
reviewed.
and
i'm
merely
suggest
that
because
i'm
not
ready
to
accept
that
sibron
itself
or
that
the
decisions
of
this
court
have
clearly
enunciated
the
rule
that
in
the
mootness
cases,
the
presumption
exists
that
there
is
collateral
consequence
on
the
one
hand
and
that
the
burglary
is
on
the
state
on
the
other.
but
i
do
share
the
view
of
the
solicitor
general
that
even
though
that
may
be
the
rule
with
respect
to
the
mootness
doctrine
it
should
not
be
and
is
not
we
believe
the
rule
with
respect
to
concurrent
sentencing
and
the
hirabayashi
rule.
we
believe
that
if
you
go
to
sibron
itself
one
thing
is
very
clear
as
it
is
in
pollard
and
that
is
that
in
both
instances
the
court
has
pointed
out
that
is
not
just
simply
a
case
of
a
possibility.
is
not
just
simply
a
case
of
the
parade
of
horribles
being
dragged
along
and
saying
that
anything
can
happen
because
anybody
who
has
imagination
can
create
a
possibility
simply
because
they
have
an
imagination.
but
what
the
court
--
what
you
said
mr.
chief
justice
in
the
sibron
case
was
that,
if
i
have
the
right
quotations,
the
conclusion
you
said,
“st.
pierre
versus
united
states,
must
be
read
in
light
of
later
cases
to
mean
that
a
criminal
case
is
moot
only
if
it
is
shown
that
there
is
no
possibility
that
any
collateral
legal
consequences
will
be
imposed
on
the
basis
of
the
challenge
conviction.
that
certainly
is
not
the
case
here
sibron
has
a
substantial
state
in
the
judgment
of
conviction
which
survives
the
satisfaction
of
the
sentence
imposed
on
him
and
i
would
point
out,
that
in
the
sibron
case
the
state
acknowledged
and
admitted
that
there
would
be
collateral
consequences
in
so
far
as
this
particular
defendant
was
concerned.
so,
i
do
not
argue
with
sibron.
i
do
not
argue
with
the
doctrine
that
whether
there
are
substantial
collateral
consequences
the
right
of
review
should
in
fact
exist.
the
same
thing
is
true
in
pollard,
if
we
go
to
the
language
of
the
court
in
pollard
the
court
said,
“the
possibility
of
consequences
collateral
to
the
imposition
of
sentence
is
sufficiently
substantial
to
justify
our
dealing
with
the
merits.
again,
it
is
not
just
simply
a
claim
of
collateral
of
consequence
but
there
has
to
be
some
showing
and
i
believe
that
that
showing
should
be
the
burden
of
the
showing
should
be
on
the
--
mr.
francis
b.
burch
two
what?
mr.
francis
b.
burch
i
may
be
wrong
but
i
don't
believe
they
apply
the
concurrent
sentence.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor
and
i
would
hesitate
to
say
categorically,
they
do
not
because
that
could
be
wrong
but
i
do
not
believe
that
they
do.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
if
they
were
--
mr.
francis
b.
burch
yes,
i
think.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
no,
i
think
that
this
would
be
a
circumstance
which
would
warrant
in
that
ability
of
the
concurrent
sentencing
doctrine.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
doesn't
use
the
what?
mr.
francis
b.
burch
oh,
yes,
yes
we
do.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
and
i
wanted
to
address
myself
that
the
meade
case
makes
it
very
clear.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
i
don't
know
that
we
said
it
to
the
rule
does
not
apply
at
all
--
mr.
francis
b.
burch
the
other
side
--
mr.
francis
b.
burch
they
cited
in
their
reply
brief
then
mr.
cramer,
they
cited
the
case
of
brady
versus
maryland.
well,
actually
what
brady
versus
maryland
did
if
i
may
--
the
concluding
paragraph
of
the
court
in
brady
versus
maryland
was
although
the
judgment
under
the
first
count
in
indictment
number
4073
was
null
and
void.
we
see
no
reason
to
remind
for
a
new
trial
since
the
lower
court
sentence
the
appellant
to
10
years
in
number
4074
to
run
concurrently
with
number
4073.
and
the
same
--
under
the
same
facts
of
circumstance
and
what
the
court
did
it
reviewed
4073
which
ended
up
by
being
the
bad
count.
but
the
reason
they
reviewed
it
because
there
was
the
first
count
and
they
found
that
invalid,
it
reverse
on
that,
it
did
what
the
solicitor
general
has
said
--
mr.
strauss
has
said
and
that
is
sometimes
they
will
review
but
where
it
serves
no
good
purpose
they
don't
review
because
of
the
efficiency
of
the
judicial
system
on
the
appellant
system.
but
in
this
case
the
first
count
was
found
to
be
bad.
they
reversed
as
to
that
count
but
they
did
not
remand
because
they
employed
the
language
of
the
concurrent
sentence
doctrine
it
said
in
effect
it
would
be
harmless
error
in
any
event.
and
in
the
case
of
meade
versus
state,
this
was
where
there
was
a
concurrent
sentence
with
on
a
number
of
counts
on
general
sentencing
on
a
number
of
counts
and
the
court
in
affect
applies
the
basis
philosophy
of
the
concurrent
sentence
doctrine.
in
the
meade,
it
would
not
review
all
of
the
other
counts
once
it
found,
one
of
the
counts
valid.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
this
is
my
understanding
but
i
wouldn't
want
to
make
a
representation
to
the
court
because
i'm
not
100%
sure
but
i
believe
i'm
right.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
if
they
have
five
cases
arising
out
of
different
sets
of
circumstances
that
maybe
tried
the
same
day
i
can
see
where
the
court
--
mr.
francis
b.
burch
i
understand
that.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
i
don't
know
of
the
instances
where
this
is
happening
your
honor
but
if
it
did,
if
there
were
--
there
was
a
trial
today
and
next
week
another
trial
two
different
crimes,
two
different
sets
of
circumstances,
two
different
indictments,
and
there
were
two
convictions
then
i
think
the
concurrent
sentence
doctrine
would
not
apply.
i
think
this
would
be
the
type
of
instance
where
the
right
of
review
should
exist.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
because
then
you
have
two
separate
convictions
by
a
different
courts,
different
juries
removed
each
from
the
other
in
time
and
that
the
circumstances
are
different.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
and
then,
it
could
have
the
possibility
of
collateral
consequence.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
because
then
it's
possible
that
there
may
be
the
number
of
convictions
under
different
sets
of
facts
and
circumstance
that
a
subsequent
court
in
imposing
a
sentence
might
take
into
consideration.
it
might
have
some
effect
on
the
--
mr.
francis
b.
burch
well,
i'm
not
so
sure
because
under
the
--
there's
a
florida
law
review
article
in
--
i'm
sorry
i
don't
have
the
article
here
but
the
case
comes
discussing
this
question
of
recidivism
and
the
penalty
says
many
states
has
statute
similar
in
purpose
to
the
one
in
florida.
this
statute
is
generally
are
of
two
classes.
those
which
specifically
state
the
rule
that
the
commission
of
each
offense
must
be
subsequent
in
time
to
conviction
for
the
last
previous
offense.
and
those
that
are
less
specific
merely
mentioning
previous
convictions
and
subsequent
offenses
without
reference
to
the
time
element.
by
a
great
numerical
majority,
courts
of
states
having
statutes
of
the
second
type
have
construed
their
provisions
as
operating
in
the
manner
expressly
stated
in
legislation
of
the
first
type
considering
the
philosophy
underlying
habitual
criminal
statute
in
which
best
the
case
should
be
act
when
question
falls
such
interpretations
are
not
surprising.
the
purpose
of
most
habitual
criminal
statutes
is
to
protect
society
from
criminals
who
persist
in
the
commission
of
felonies.
the
statutes
contemplate
however,
that
on
opportunity
for
reformation
be
given
after
each
conviction
before
concluding
that
the
criminal
habit
is
incurable.
and
that
is
why
i
was
going
to
address
myself
to
the
point
i
think
mr.
chief
justice
here
raised
and
that
is
that
the
application
of
the
recidivism
statutes
has
generally
been
and
i
think
from
(inaudible)
all
amounts
we
had
has
been
almost
uniform
throughout
the
country
that
they
look
at
what
has
happened
after
this
given
point
of
time,
to
see
whether
or
six
months
or
year
or
two
years
later
there
has
been
a
falling
back
in
to
the
old
ways
and
more
crime
has
been
committed.
we
have
no
recidivism
statute
in
maryland.
so
that
it
really
becomes
of
no
particular
consequences
so
far
as
this
particular
case
is
concern
although
i'm
sure
the
court
will
address
itself
to
the
broad
question.
one
of
the
things
that
bothers
me
about
these
whole
thing
is
just
what
is
going
to
happen
if
the
concurrent
sentencing
doctrine
is
abolish
by
this
court.
i
know
what
problems
we
had
in
the
state
of
maryland
in
dealing
in
the
habeas
corpus
cases
with
the
--
at
the
federal
court
level.
we
have
reached
the
point
that
i
had
to
go
to
the
governor
of
the
state
of
maryland
to
get
additional
funds
in
order
to
hire
additional
assistance
to
attorney
general
to
be
able
to
keep
up
with
the
work
load
in
the
federal
court,
and
this
is
a
very
difficult
situation
and
it's
becoming
even
worst
in
the
state
courts.
now,
this
means
that
we're
having
a
backlog
of
cases
at
the
appellate
level,
we're
having
a
backlog
of
cases
at
the
federal
district
court
level
and
then
the
net
end
result
of
it
is
that
those
who
are
not
out
on
bail
by
necessity,
you're
going
to
have
to
spend
more
time
in
jail
awaiting
either
the
culmination
of
their
cases
on
appeal
or
new
trials
whatever
the
case
might
be.
and
i
would
hate
to
think
that
unless
there
is
a
showing
of
a
collateral
consequence
in
the
words
of
sibron
of
a
substantial
nature,
or
in
the
words
of
pollard
of
a
substantial
nature
that
we
would
create
even,
even
greater
backlog
that
would
require
those
people
who
are
now
languishing
in
jail
awaiting
the
culmination
of
all
of
their
appeals
that
were
required
then
to
stay
there
even
longer
--
mr.
francis
b.
burch
--
and
i
think
this
is
a
practical
question
that
we
must
adjust
ourselves
too.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
that's
correct.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
to
the
first
--
to
the
special
court
of
appeals
then
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
mr.
justice
fortas,
yes
i
do.
i
see
a
distinction
and
that
i
think
that
the
concurrent
sentencing
doctrine
should
be
under
all
circumstances
keep
viable
at
the
--
on
the
collateral
basis.
that
is
so
that
they
can't
go
in
under
the
habeas
corpus
in
to
the
federal
court
after
they
had
the
opportunity
to
do
it
at
the
on
the
direct
appeal
level.
i
believe
that
it
is
a
viable
doctrine
that
should
be
applied
on
direct
appeal
as
well
at
the
collateral
level
but
certainly
if
it
should
ever
come
to
pass
where
it
is
not
kept
at
the
direct
appeal
level
it
should
never
be
abandoned
and
so
far
as
the
collateral
level
is
concerned
because
at
least
that
opportunity
has
been
afforded
through
the
method
of
direct
appeal.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
it'
simply
gets
down
to
the
question
of
the
fact
that
the
defendants
in
many
instances
are
tried
on
multiple
counts.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
you
have
as
in
this
case
a
jury
trial,
multiple
counts.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
well
i
say
you
have
a
--
in
this
case
a
jury
question.
the
district
attorney
or
the
states
attorney,
as
we
call
them
in
maryland,
prepares
the
indictments
grand
jury
indicts
and
they
may
feel
that
they
cannot
be
press
at
that
at
the
then
state
of
investigation
that
they
may
be
able
to
prove
through
these
series
of
facts
that
there
was
burglary.
or
they
may
not
be
able
to
prove
all
of
the
elements
of
burglary
but
they
may
be
able
to
prove
the
elements
of
larceny
or
they
may
not
be
able
to
prove
all
of
the
elements
of
either
one
of
this
and
they
may
be
able
to
prove
the
elements
of
housebreaking
which
for
the
three
counts
needs
particular
indictments.
the
housebreaking
one
by
the
way
was
abandoned
on
both
instances
before
a
trial
took
place.
so,
now
you
have
the
case
go
to
the
jury
as
this
did
in
one
case
the
jury
came
in
guilty
as
to
count
burglary
not
guilty
as
to
larceny.
on
the
later
trial,
they
came
in
guilty
as
to
burglary,
guilty
as
to
larceny.
the
judges
now
in
the
position
of
imposing
the
sentence,
he
imposes
the
sentence
on
the
two
counts,
they
have
found
--
been
found
guilty
of
both.
he
opposes
the
sentence
on
the
two
counts.
both
of
these
cases
now
are
subject
to
appeal.
it
may
be
as
we
did
in
the
brady
case
where
they
found
the
first
count
to
be
defective
that
they
reversed
as
to
that
but
then
they
found
the
second
count
to
be
valid
and
therefore
the
imposition
of
the
sentence
was
upheld.
so
that
there
could
be
a
failure
on
the
part
of
the
state
to
prove
this
particular
aspect
of
that
particular
crime
as
alleged
in
the
indictment,
whereas
it
may
be
able
to
be
sustained
under
a
second
count
of
burglary.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
and
this
is
the
problem
that
they're
using
the
opportunity
to
try
to
--
on
the
basis
of
the
facts
have
a
valid
conviction
and
the
court
then
sentences
on
both.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
i
don't
really
believe
mr.
justice
that
this
is
the
philosophy
of
the
lower
court
judges
in
maryland.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
i
would
say
that
almost
invariably
the
federal
--
the
courts
in
maryland
when
there
are
multiple
counts
and
convictions
on
multiple
counts
of
rising
out
of
the
same
facts
and
circumstances
will
impose
concurrent
sentences.
it's
a
rare
thing,
a
very
rare
thing
to
read
where
the
court
below
has
imposed
sentences
on
these
multiple
counts
and
made
them
consecutive,
very
rare.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
well
we
had
it
in
the
meade
case.
i,
myself
don't
have
that
much
contact
with
the
lower
courts
to
be
able
to
evaluate
what
they
do
on
--
mr.
francis
b.
burch
mr.
borgerding
might
be
better
able
to
answer
this.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
this
--
there
could
have
been.
there
could
have
been
but
i
think
like
the
--
mr.
strauss,
the
solicitor
general
believes
i
think
that
the
rights
of
the
defendant
are
better
protected
by
the
concurrent
sentences
on
the
specific
counts
than
on
the
general
sentence.
and
i
would
hate
to
have
to
go
to
the
general
sentence
on
multiple
counts
when
i
think
the
rights
of
the
defendant
are
better
protected
on
this
specific
sentences
on
these
specific
counts.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
the
appellate
--
mr.
francis
b.
burch
well,
there
isn't
much
legal
literature
on
that.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
and
i
would
say
that
generally
the
courts
if
once
they
find
a
good
count
and
the
sentences
has
been
imposed
as,
let's
say
10
years
on
a
particular
count
unless
the
maximum
for
all
the
counts
that
they
won't
go
into
the
other
counts
because
it's
just
simply
a
matter
of
a
great
inconvenience.
the
court
would
have
to
write
an
opinion,
have
to
go
down
as
to
each
of
the
counts
and
it
would
end
up
by
being
extremely
difficult,
burdensome,
time-consuming
function
of
the
court
and
again
unless
there
can
be
shown
some
collateral
consequence
to
the
defendant.
i
believe
sincerely
that
it
serves
no
purpose
as
far
as
the
defendant
is
concerned.
it
serves
no
purposes
far
as
the
courts
are
concerned,
and
it
serves
a
great
disservice
as
far
as
the
other
defendants
who
may
be
languishing
in
jail
awaiting
the
disposition
of
their
cases
on
appeal
or
a
new
trial.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
well,
mr.
chief
justice
anything
is
possible
but
let
me
say
this
that
whatever
that
conviction
is,
it
is
reviewable
on
appeal.
and
if
all
of
those
four
counts
are
infected
with
some
error
because
they
did
not
mount
up
to
the
quantum
of
proof
that
the
law
requires,
then
they
all
would
be
reverse
on
appeal,
that's
the
first
thing.
the
second
thing
is
and
i
must
defend
the
right
of
the
district
attorney
to
have
the
indictments
handed
down
on
a
multiple
counts
because
let's
face
it
we
had
some
very
brilliant
defense
lawyers
who
are
at
the
bar
everyday.
and
if
they
can
use
the
technicality
of
the
law
whether
it
be
because
of
a
defect
in
the
indictment
or
a
defect
in
the
proof
or
one
little
scintilla
of
evidence
that
might
be
necessary,
absolutely
to
prove
this
particular
thing
they
are
in
a
position
to
find
every
single
one
of
these
doors
to
walk
out
of.
and
i
think
then
that
the
state
has
to
right
in
fact
it
has
the
duty
it
seems
to
me
to
have
the
opportunity
to
make
a
--
to
have
the
indictments
handed
down
in
such
a
way
that
if
in
fact
there
has
been
a
crime
committed
which
is
punishable
by
the
state.
and
they
can
offer
the
proof
which
will
stand
up
on
appeal
that
society
has
the
right
to
see
that
that
conviction
stands.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
i
agree
with
you
mr.
chief
justice
if
there
are
collateral
consequences
that
can
be
shown
to
have
been
imposed
upon
this
defendant
because
of
that
state
of
affairs
then
there
should
be
the
right
up
of
review.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
but
i
must
go
with
the
harmless
error
theory
of
my
brother,
mr.
strauss.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
mr.
chief
justice,
first
of
all
i
would
say
this
sir
that
there
is
no
question
about
it
but
if
he
asked
the
question
he
has
the
opportunity
to
explain
his
answer
and
if
i
were
the
defense
lawyer
and
a
prosecuting
attorney
were
to
try
to
pull
that
kind
of
a
trick
before
a
jury,
i'll
tell
you,
i'd
go
before
that
jury
with
the
greatest
argument
than
any
defendant
ever
had.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
it
would
be
foolishness
on
the
part
of
a
district
attorney
to
try
that
type
of
thing.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
mr.
chief
justice,
mr.
justices,
during
the
course
of
this
argument
the
attorney
for
the
petitioner
raised
the
question
as
to
whether
any
evidence
of
the
taking
of
goods
in
this
particular
case
should
have
been
admitted
in
to
evidence
because
of
his
claim
that
the
larceny
conviction
was
illegal,
void
because
of
double
jeopardy.
i
think
it
should
be
noted
that
under
the
law
of
maryland
indictment
dealing
with
burglary
was
the
entering,
breaking
and
entering
with
the
intent
to
steal,
and
evidence
was
introduced
to
show
that
goods
had
in
fact
been
taken
in
order
to
show
that
the
intent
to
steal
was
present
on
which
you
would
base
the
conviction
for
burglary.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it's
very
interesting
in
this
particular
case
because
the
place
that
the
defendant
entered
was
a
wednesday
club
that
actually
had
to
be
the
property
of
the
people
whose
goods
were
taken
but
it
was
called
the
wednesday
club,
i
believe
it
was.
and
people
came
and
went
and
when
he
was
first
accosted
in
the
place
he
claim
that
he
was
there
as
a
guest
of
the
wednesday
club
so
to
speak.
so
that
it
was
important
that
they
prove
not
only
the
breaking
and
the
entering
and
the
taking
of
goods
for
the
intent
but
in
case
they
weren't
able
to
prove
the
breaking
and
entering
that's
why
they
had
the
larceny
count
to
show
the
taking
of
the
goods.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
it
maybe
intent
to
steal.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
that's
all
you
have
to
prove.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
or
you
might
say
the
taking
of
the
goods.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
the
possession
of
the
goods
was
evidence
of
intent
because
the
best
evidence
of
intent
is,
tell
me
what
you've
done
and
i'll
tell
you
what
you
intended
to
do.
so
this
--
so
that
it
supports
it.
it
would
have
to
come
in
irrespective
of
whether
it
was
a
larceny
count
or
now
there's
still
would
have
to
come
in
order
to
properly
prove
the
burglary
count.
now,
let's
go
to
the
question
of
what
where
the
collateral
consequences
if
any
that
would
be
suffered
by
this
defendant
by
the
concurrent
sentencing.
the
first
thing
is
parole.
it
makes
no
difference
whether
he
is
in
for
10
years
or
15
years
plus
5
on
a
concurrent
basis
because
his
parole
rights
are
exactly
the
same.
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
read
s
the
solicitor
general
has
pointed
out
in
his
brief.
“when
the
parole
board
makes
a
determination
as
to
whether
parole
should
be
granted,
they
look
to
the
background
of
the
--
and
the
circumstances
of
the
crimes
committed,
the
conduct
and
so
on
and
so
forth
in
trying
to
determine
on
a
current
basis
whether
or
not
this
particular
inmate
may
make
a
good
parolee.”
under
the
law
of
maryland
which
is
in
article
41
section
111,
it
says
that
talking
about
the
board
of
parole.
“it
shall
be
the
duty
of
the
board
in
carrying
out
his
power
as
authorize
herein,
in
determining
whether
a
prisoner
is
suitable
for
release
on
parole,
(1)
to
consider
the
circumstances
surrounding
the
crime
and
the
physical
and
mental
qualifications
of
persons
who
eligible
for
parole.
(2)
to
determine
whether
there
is
reasonable
probability
that
the
prisoner
if
release
on
parole
will
remain
at
liberty
without
violating
the
laws
and
whether
the
release
of
the
prisoner
on
parole
is
compatible
with
the
welfare
of
the
society.”
and
that
is
the
test
that
just
is
to
be
applied
by
the
parole
board.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
conviction
of
larceny
would
absolutely
not
come
into
the
picture
at
all
in
determining
a
parole
because
they
would
go
to
the
facts
and
the
circumstances.
they
would
find
that
the
same
act
was
the
subject
matter
of
the
conviction
of
burglary
and
the
conviction
for
larceny.
so
they
take
the
facts
and
circumstances
as
directed
and
required
by
the
statute
and
they
apply
their
test
and
then
they
look
and
say
is
this
man
eligible?
is
this
man
a
good
risk
for
parole?
this
is
the
sole
thing
that
parole
board
would
be
required
to
consider.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
if
there
where
a
series
of
crimes
and
he
was
convicted
of
all
say
five
and
he
was
given
concurrent
sentences.
there
is
a
greater
likelihood
but
i
don't
believe
the
parole
board
in
maryland
at
least
would
consider
that
other
than
the
fact,
yes
they
would
consider
the
nature
of
the
person,
the
disposition
towards
multiple
crimes.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
so
that
on
the
series
of
crimes
i
think
probably
but
that
would
be
a
factor
that
would
be
involved
but
this
was
not
situation
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
yes.
impeaching
the
petitioner's
credibility,
well
as
mr.
cramer
pointed
out
in
his
argument
he
was
regretful
that
in
his
brief,
he
only
indicated
that
there
had
been
one
felony
conviction
of
this
particular
defendant.
i
refer
the
court
to
our
supplementary
brief
on
page
20
where
we
show
not
only
three
felonies
but
we
show
several
misdemeanors
and
plus
contempt
and
this
would
certainly
indicate
that
the
additional
conviction
on
larceny
under
the
same
facts
and
circumstance
of
the
conviction
of
burglary
would
have
absolutely
no
effect
whatsoever
on
the
impeachment
of
the
witness
in
his
credibility.
and
i
believe
i
gave
your
honor
mr.
chief
justice
an
example,
that
if
i
were
the
defendant's
lawyer
i
would
love
to
have
the
prosecuting
attorney
get
up
and
side
us,
make
two
crimes
out
of
this
thing
of
attacking
the
credibility
because
i
think
it
would
come
back
and
hit
him
right
in
his
face
if
i
may
use
of
an
active
verb.
affecting
the
sentencing
of
the
court,
i
think
it's
exactly
the
same
posture.
we're
not
talking
about
different
crimes
we're
talking
about
one
set
of
facts
and
circumstances
in
this
particular
case
and
i
don't
believe
that
there
would
have
one
iota
of
effect
on
the
court
in
so
far
as
future
sentencing
is
concerned.
ineligibility
for
licenses,
here
we
have
a
man
who
is
convicted
of
three
felonies,
several
misdemeanors
and
under
the
law
of
maryland
certain
licenses
are
not
--
you
cannot
get
certain
licenses
if
you
are
not
of
good
moral
character.
the
fact
that
he's
had
this
other
felony
convictions,
the
fact
that
he
was
no
convicted
of
burglary
and
that
this
other
concurrent
to
sentencing
for
rising
out
of
the
same
facts
of
circumstances
wouldn't
affect
one
iota
his
eligibility
for
licensing
because
he
wouldn't
be
eligible
because
he
wouldn't
be
of
good
moral
character
in
view
of
his
record.
the
right
to
vote,
he's
been
convicted
of
three
felonies,
he
wouldn't
have
the
right
to
vote
irrespective
of
what
happened
in
this
particular
case
and
the
same
thing
with
respect
to
the
right
to
serve
as
a
juror.
so
when
we
look
at
all
of
the
factors
in
this
particular
case,
the
goal
to
determine
and
to
give
us
some
indication
as
to
whether
there
is
a
reasonable
possibility.
unanimous
substantial
possibility
but
a
reasonable
possibility
that
this
concurrent
conviction,
this
concurrent
sentencing
might
have
an
adverse
effect
upon
him
or
collateral
consequences
as
far
as
he's
concerned,
the
answer
has
to
be
a
categorical
no
would
not
have
any
effect.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
i
don't
think
it
would
be
any
question
about
it.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
if
that
in
fact
were
the
case
your
honor,
yes
and
i
--
in
our
appreciation
as
we
have
set
forth
in
our
brief
and
as
i
say
here
--
mr.
francis
b.
burch
he
would
have
the
right
to
put
on
the
record
all
of
the
evidence
and
whatnot
--
mr.
francis
b.
burch
if
your
honor
please
it
may
well
be
that
this
court
might
feel
that
constitutional
rights
have
been
denied
and
if
so
then
that
will
be
a
proper
case
but
we
don't
kill
the
patient
in
order
to
cure
the
ill.
if
in
appropriate
case,
it's
been
shown
there's
been
an
abuse
then
there's
a
remedy
to
this
court
or
to
the
courts
of
the
state
towards
the
federal
courts.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
at
that
time.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
exactly
right,
your
honor
this
is
the
position
that
we
have
taken
both
in
our
brief
then
i
take
to
you
before
your
honors
today
that
we
recognize
that
there
are
certain
circumstances
whether
it
will
be
collateral
of
consequences
if
you
have
a
concurrent
sentencing
doctrine
which
is
applied
without
the
--
any
consideration
being
given
to
the
particular
facts
as
the
circumstances.
but
in
this
case,
there
isn't
one
single
scintilla
of
evidence
nor
is
there
one
single
argument
that
i
could
conceive
--
that
i
have
perceived
that
suggested
there
would
be
any
collateral
consequences
to
this
defendant.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
i
have
said
that
we
were
here
today
to
review
the
viability
of
the
concurrent
sentencing
doctrine.
we
take
the
position
that
it
is
viable,
it
is
still
viable,
it
is
important
and
so
far
as
the
administration
of
justice
and
the
expeditious
administration
of
justice
is
concerned.
but
there
are
circumstances
such
as
in
sibron
which
was
not
the
concurrent
sentencing
doctrine
but
to
mootness
doctrine.
but
there
are
circumstances
where
there
has
been
a
concession
that
there
has
been,
there
will
be
collateral
consequences
or
where
there
can
be
proof
shown
that
there
were
in
fact
a
lot
of
consequences
than
in
those
in
cases
there
should
be
a
remedy.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
well,
could
i
refer
the
court
to
have
that
brief
--
original
brief
that
says
all
six
questions
were
considered
by
the
court
although
the
opinion
may
not
deal
with
it.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
yes.
we'll
see
that
copy
of
the
opinion
is
submitted.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
mr.
chief
justice,
mr.
justices
--
mr.
francis
b.
burch
--
may
it
please
your
honors.
if
i
may
i'd
like
to
address
myself
to
some
of
the
opening
remarks
made
by
mr.
cramer.
i
think
he
probably
unintentionally
overlooked
pointing
out
to
the
court
that
with
respect
to
the
increase
of
penalty
on
the
second
trial
for
burglary
from
10
years
to
15
years
that
this
is
a
matter
of
a
separate
proceeding
before
the
united
states
district
court
in
maryland.
the
matter
has
been
decided.
the
federal
court
has
directed
that
the
sentence
be
reduced
to
10
years.
it
is
on
appeal
to
the
circuit
court
for
the
fourth
circuit
and
being
held
by
the
circuit
court
for
the
fourth
circuit
pending
the
outcome
of
this
proceeding
and
i
thought
that
it
is
important
that
the
court
be
apprised
of
the
fact
that
as
far
as
that
10-year,
15-year
aspect
to
the
matter
is
concerned
it
has
been
adjudicated
and
that
of
itself
is
on
appeal.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
excuse
me,
sir?
mr.
francis
b.
burch
they
granted
a
--
your
honor,
they
granted
--
district
court
did
write
an
opinion
in
that
case.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
on
the
theory
of
double
jeopardy
that
by
increasing
the
penalty
that
it
was
in
the
nature
of
double
jeopardy
and
therefore
it
should
not
have
been
permitted
to
increase
the
penalty
under
the
patton
case.
mr.
cramer
has
pointed
out
that
it
was
prejudicial
to
try
the
larceny
case
in
the
second
trial
about
the
burglary
case
because
the
larceny
case
under
his
interpretation
or
theory
of
the
case
was
in
fact
a
double
jeopardy
proceeding.
i
might
point
out
that
this
would
be
true
with
respect
to
any
account
that
was
held
to
be
invalid
if
there
was,
there
were
five
counts
and
one
was
good
and
four
were
held
to
be
invalid,
you
could
say
that
trying
the
one
good
count
with
the
four
invalid
counts
would
effect
the
one
good
one
and
consequently
that
the
one
good
count
should
be
thrown
out
and
i
don't
believe
that
any
of
the
cases
hold
to
that
effect.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
in
the
first
case.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
i'm
not
sure
i
quite
understood
your
question,
mr.
justice.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
that's
correct.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
that's
correct
but
in
this
particular
case
because
of
the
schowgurow
case
and
his
having
in
the
schowgurow
case
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
all
indictments
by
grand
juries
who
were
required
to
profess
their
belief
in
god
were
invalid.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
and
he
was
given
the
opportunity.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
the
opportunity
was
given
him
to
get
the
advice
of
counsel
to
decide
whether
he
wanted
the
first
indictment
sustain
and
to
pursue
his
appeal
that
was
the
intending
in
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland
whether
he
wanted
to
stand
under
a
new
indictment
which
would
have
been
included
the
same
counts
as
the
original
indictment.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
he
had
an
acquittal
in
the
first
--
mr.
francis
b.
burch
--
case
but
the
court
held
that
he
had
waived
and
i
know
this
was
all
argued
that
the
previous
hearing
that
he
had
waived
any
of
the
rights
he
had
under
the
first
series
of
indictments
in
the
counsel
because
that
was
stricken
out
the
first
indictment,
everything
fell
with
it.
and
therefore
he
was
to
stand
trial
as
there
where
a
new
trial
to
begin
with
in
the
first
instance.
if
your
honor
mr.
chief
justice
say
in
the
sibron
case
--
mr.
francis
b.
burch
we
take
the
position
that
under
the
waiver
which
was
signed
and
if
your
honors
are
interested
on
the
position
to
read
to
you
the
actual
proceedings
that
at
the
time
of
the
second
indictment
when
he
was
apprised
with
counsel
present
as
to
exactly
what
the
situation
was,
as
to
fact
that
he
might
receive
an
increase
sentence
do
i
have
that
if
you
please?
mr.
francis
b.
burch
well,
the
issue
was
never
raise
up
until
the
point
was
reached
here
at
the
time
of
argument
and
we
therefore
do
not
have
it
in
the
record
because
it
was
never
raise
by
the
petitioner
below.
but
if
i
may,
i
would
like
--
the
court
have
thoroughly
explained
to
him
and
this
is
the
court
now
at
the
time
about
the
second
indictment
as
pressing
the
remark
now
to
counsel
for
the
defendant.
“have
you
thoroughly
explained
to
him
and
do
you
understand
all
of
the
prevision
of
the
schowgurow
case?”
mr.
o'malley:
“yes,
sir.”
the
court:
“you
have
thoroughly
explained
to
him
all
aspects
of
it?”
the
court:
“that
he
is
not
required
in
any
manner
to
waive
his
original
trial
or
appeal,
he
may
allow
his
appeal
to
stand
you
have
explain
that
him?”
mr.
o'malley:
“he
can
allow
his
appeal
to
stand
and
waive
a
new
trial,
yes
sir.”
the
court:
“in
the
court
of
appeals?”
mr.
o'malley:
“he
can.
i
have
explained
to
him
that
he
can
elect
to
proceed
on
his
present
appeal
or
in
the
alternative
he
can
ask
to
be
tried
anew
with
a
new
indictment.”
the
court:
“and
what
has
been
his
choice?”
mr.
o'malley:
“his
choice
is
to
have
a
new
trial.”
the
court:
“new
trial?
now
does
he
fully
understand
and
i
direct
my
remarks
directly
to
you,
benton,
do
you
fully
understand
that
she
will
be
tried
again
and
if
found
guilty
you
could
get
a
greater
sentence?”
the
defendant:
“yes,
sir.”
the
court:
“and
it
would
be
no
inference
in
any
manner
that
in
any
time
that
you
have
put
in
thus
far
would
be
credited
towards
that
sentence?”
“yes,
sir.”
“do
you
understand
that?”
the
court:
“very
well,
under
the
facts
developed
at
this
particular
hearing
the
court
awards
you
a
new
trial.
now,
do
i
understand
his
been
arraigned
under
the
entry
of
the
clerk?”
“yes,
your
honor.”
then
they
proceeded
to
the
arraignment.
and
the
clerk:
“you
have
been
indicted
by
the
grand
jury
for
prince
george's
county
on
the
charge
of
burglary,
common
law
housebreaking
and
larceny.
and
mr.
o'malley:
“as
your
attorney
in
this
case,
yes
or
not,
do
you
plead
in
this
case
guilty
or
not
guilty?”
the
defendant:
“not
guilty.”
“how
do
you
elect
to
have
this
case
tried,
by
the
court
or
by
jury?”
the
defendant:
“by
jury.”
mr.
francis
b.
burch
now,
the
court:
“very
well
are
you
in
jail
at
the
moment?”
“no
sir,
i
am
on
bond.”
he
was
on
bond
so
was
the
question
if
your
honor
please
of
there
being
any
credit
given
for
the
time
that
he
spend
in
jail
because
he
was
on
bond.
he
had
not
spend
any
time
in
jail?
mr.
francis
b.
burch
it's
correct
sir.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
actually
it
was
never
set
aside
because
his
appeal
was
in
process
and
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland
gave
the
opportunity
to
all
those
--
mr.
francis
b.
burch
--
who's
cases
are
not
been
concluded
--
mr.
francis
b.
burch
to
ask
for
new
trials.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
that's
correct.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
that's
correct.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
of
maryland.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
directly
that
the
sentence
be
reduced
from
15
years
to
10
years
on
the
burglary
count.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
that's
correct.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
i
don't
know
that
it
would
have
any
connection
with
the
harmless
error
on
the
concurrent
sentence
because
it
makes
no
different
whether
the
sentence
on
the
burglary
is
15
years
or
10
years
in
so
far
as
the
5-year
concurrent
larceny
is
concerned.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
they're
still
served
together.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
and
they'll
be
allowed
for
parole
--
for
parole
at
the
--
after
you
serve
25%
less
good
time
on
the
10-year
sentence
assuming
that
that's
what
the
ultimate
disposition
is
at
the
federal
level.
mr.
chief
justice,
in
sibron,
i
believe
that
you
made
the
observation
that
you
thought
that
the
pollard
has
in
effect
created
a
presumption
of
collateral
consequence
and
that
the
burden
was
therefore
on
the
state
to
prove
that
there
was
no
collateral
consequence.
and
i
have
read
the
pollard,
and
quite
frankly
i
see
nothing
in
the
opinion
itself
which
directs
itself
to
the
question
of
presumptions
under
one
hand
or
burden
on
the
other.
there
is
just
a
very
short
paragraph
in
there
in
which
the
court
says
that
there
appears
to
be
substantial
likelihood
of
collateral
consequences
in
so
far
as
the
defendant
and
in
that
case
was
concerned.
and
it
may
well
be
that
the
record
of
the
case
would
disclose
that
in
fact
there
were
some
significant
collateral
consequences
on
the
face
that
would
be
--
that
the
defendant
himself
might
have
suffer
if
the
conviction
were
allowed
to
stand
and
reviewed.
and
i'm
merely
suggest
that
because
i'm
not
ready
to
accept
that
sibron
itself
or
that
the
decisions
of
this
court
have
clearly
enunciated
the
rule
that
in
the
mootness
cases,
the
presumption
exists
that
there
is
collateral
consequence
on
the
one
hand
and
that
the
burglary
is
on
the
state
on
the
other.
but
i
do
share
the
view
of
the
solicitor
general
that
even
though
that
may
be
the
rule
with
respect
to
the
mootness
doctrine
it
should
not
be
and
is
not
we
believe
the
rule
with
respect
to
concurrent
sentencing
and
the
hirabayashi
rule.
we
believe
that
if
you
go
to
sibron
itself
one
thing
is
very
clear
as
it
is
in
pollard
and
that
is
that
in
both
instances
the
court
has
pointed
out
that
is
not
just
simply
a
case
of
a
possibility.
is
not
just
simply
a
case
of
the
parade
of
horribles
being
dragged
along
and
saying
that
anything
can
happen
because
anybody
who
has
imagination
can
create
a
possibility
simply
because
they
have
an
imagination.
but
what
the
court
--
what
you
said
mr.
chief
justice
in
the
sibron
case
was
that,
if
i
have
the
right
quotations,
the
conclusion
you
said,
“st.
pierre
versus
united
states,
must
be
read
in
light
of
later
cases
to
mean
that
a
criminal
case
is
moot
only
if
it
is
shown
that
there
is
no
possibility
that
any
collateral
legal
consequences
will
be
imposed
on
the
basis
of
the
challenge
conviction.
that
certainly
is
not
the
case
here
sibron
has
a
substantial
state
in
the
judgment
of
conviction
which
survives
the
satisfaction
of
the
sentence
imposed
on
him
and
i
would
point
out,
that
in
the
sibron
case
the
state
acknowledged
and
admitted
that
there
would
be
collateral
consequences
in
so
far
as
this
particular
defendant
was
concerned.
so,
i
do
not
argue
with
sibron.
i
do
not
argue
with
the
doctrine
that
whether
there
are
substantial
collateral
consequences
the
right
of
review
should
in
fact
exist.
the
same
thing
is
true
in
pollard,
if
we
go
to
the
language
of
the
court
in
pollard
the
court
said,
“the
possibility
of
consequences
collateral
to
the
imposition
of
sentence
is
sufficiently
substantial
to
justify
our
dealing
with
the
merits.
again,
it
is
not
just
simply
a
claim
of
collateral
of
consequence
but
there
has
to
be
some
showing
and
i
believe
that
that
showing
should
be
the
burden
of
the
showing
should
be
on
the
--
mr.
francis
b.
burch
two
what?
mr.
francis
b.
burch
i
may
be
wrong
but
i
don't
believe
they
apply
the
concurrent
sentence.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor
and
i
would
hesitate
to
say
categorically,
they
do
not
because
that
could
be
wrong
but
i
do
not
believe
that
they
do.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
if
they
were
--
mr.
francis
b.
burch
yes,
i
think.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
no,
i
think
that
this
would
be
a
circumstance
which
would
warrant
in
that
ability
of
the
concurrent
sentencing
doctrine.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
doesn't
use
the
what?
mr.
francis
b.
burch
oh,
yes,
yes
we
do.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
and
i
wanted
to
address
myself
that
the
meade
case
makes
it
very
clear.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
i
don't
know
that
we
said
it
to
the
rule
does
not
apply
at
all
--
mr.
francis
b.
burch
the
other
side
--
mr.
francis
b.
burch
they
cited
in
their
reply
brief
then
mr.
cramer,
they
cited
the
case
of
brady
versus
maryland.
well,
actually
what
brady
versus
maryland
did
if
i
may
--
the
concluding
paragraph
of
the
court
in
brady
versus
maryland
was
although
the
judgment
under
the
first
count
in
indictment
number
4073
was
null
and
void.
we
see
no
reason
to
remind
for
a
new
trial
since
the
lower
court
sentence
the
appellant
to
10
years
in
number
4074
to
run
concurrently
with
number
4073.
and
the
same
--
under
the
same
facts
of
circumstance
and
what
the
court
did
it
reviewed
4073
which
ended
up
by
being
the
bad
count.
but
the
reason
they
reviewed
it
because
there
was
the
first
count
and
they
found
that
invalid,
it
reverse
on
that,
it
did
what
the
solicitor
general
has
said
--
mr.
strauss
has
said
and
that
is
sometimes
they
will
review
but
where
it
serves
no
good
purpose
they
don't
review
because
of
the
efficiency
of
the
judicial
system
on
the
appellant
system.
but
in
this
case
the
first
count
was
found
to
be
bad.
they
reversed
as
to
that
count
but
they
did
not
remand
because
they
employed
the
language
of
the
concurrent
sentence
doctrine
it
said
in
effect
it
would
be
harmless
error
in
any
event.
and
in
the
case
of
meade
versus
state,
this
was
where
there
was
a
concurrent
sentence
with
on
a
number
of
counts
on
general
sentencing
on
a
number
of
counts
and
the
court
in
affect
applies
the
basis
philosophy
of
the
concurrent
sentence
doctrine.
in
the
meade,
it
would
not
review
all
of
the
other
counts
once
it
found,
one
of
the
counts
valid.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
this
is
my
understanding
but
i
wouldn't
want
to
make
a
representation
to
the
court
because
i'm
not
100%
sure
but
i
believe
i'm
right.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
if
they
have
five
cases
arising
out
of
different
sets
of
circumstances
that
maybe
tried
the
same
day
i
can
see
where
the
court
--
mr.
francis
b.
burch
i
understand
that.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
i
don't
know
of
the
instances
where
this
is
happening
your
honor
but
if
it
did,
if
there
were
--
there
was
a
trial
today
and
next
week
another
trial
two
different
crimes,
two
different
sets
of
circumstances,
two
different
indictments,
and
there
were
two
convictions
then
i
think
the
concurrent
sentence
doctrine
would
not
apply.
i
think
this
would
be
the
type
of
instance
where
the
right
of
review
should
exist.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
because
then
you
have
two
separate
convictions
by
a
different
courts,
different
juries
removed
each
from
the
other
in
time
and
that
the
circumstances
are
different.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
and
then,
it
could
have
the
possibility
of
collateral
consequence.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
because
then
it's
possible
that
there
may
be
the
number
of
convictions
under
different
sets
of
facts
and
circumstance
that
a
subsequent
court
in
imposing
a
sentence
might
take
into
consideration.
it
might
have
some
effect
on
the
--
mr.
francis
b.
burch
well,
i'm
not
so
sure
because
under
the
--
there's
a
florida
law
review
article
in
--
i'm
sorry
i
don't
have
the
article
here
but
the
case
comes
discussing
this
question
of
recidivism
and
the
penalty
says
many
states
has
statute
similar
in
purpose
to
the
one
in
florida.
this
statute
is
generally
are
of
two
classes.
those
which
specifically
state
the
rule
that
the
commission
of
each
offense
must
be
subsequent
in
time
to
conviction
for
the
last
previous
offense.
and
those
that
are
less
specific
merely
mentioning
previous
convictions
and
subsequent
offenses
without
reference
to
the
time
element.
by
a
great
numerical
majority,
courts
of
states
having
statutes
of
the
second
type
have
construed
their
provisions
as
operating
in
the
manner
expressly
stated
in
legislation
of
the
first
type
considering
the
philosophy
underlying
habitual
criminal
statute
in
which
best
the
case
should
be
act
when
question
falls
such
interpretations
are
not
surprising.
the
purpose
of
most
habitual
criminal
statutes
is
to
protect
society
from
criminals
who
persist
in
the
commission
of
felonies.
the
statutes
contemplate
however,
that
on
opportunity
for
reformation
be
given
after
each
conviction
before
concluding
that
the
criminal
habit
is
incurable.
and
that
is
why
i
was
going
to
address
myself
to
the
point
i
think
mr.
chief
justice
here
raised
and
that
is
that
the
application
of
the
recidivism
statutes
has
generally
been
and
i
think
from
(inaudible)
all
amounts
we
had
has
been
almost
uniform
throughout
the
country
that
they
look
at
what
has
happened
after
this
given
point
of
time,
to
see
whether
or
six
months
or
year
or
two
years
later
there
has
been
a
falling
back
in
to
the
old
ways
and
more
crime
has
been
committed.
we
have
no
recidivism
statute
in
maryland.
so
that
it
really
becomes
of
no
particular
consequences
so
far
as
this
particular
case
is
concern
although
i'm
sure
the
court
will
address
itself
to
the
broad
question.
one
of
the
things
that
bothers
me
about
these
whole
thing
is
just
what
is
going
to
happen
if
the
concurrent
sentencing
doctrine
is
abolish
by
this
court.
i
know
what
problems
we
had
in
the
state
of
maryland
in
dealing
in
the
habeas
corpus
cases
with
the
--
at
the
federal
court
level.
we
have
reached
the
point
that
i
had
to
go
to
the
governor
of
the
state
of
maryland
to
get
additional
funds
in
order
to
hire
additional
assistance
to
attorney
general
to
be
able
to
keep
up
with
the
work
load
in
the
federal
court,
and
this
is
a
very
difficult
situation
and
it's
becoming
even
worst
in
the
state
courts.
now,
this
means
that
we're
having
a
backlog
of
cases
at
the
appellate
level,
we're
having
a
backlog
of
cases
at
the
federal
district
court
level
and
then
the
net
end
result
of
it
is
that
those
who
are
not
out
on
bail
by
necessity,
you're
going
to
have
to
spend
more
time
in
jail
awaiting
either
the
culmination
of
their
cases
on
appeal
or
new
trials
whatever
the
case
might
be.
and
i
would
hate
to
think
that
unless
there
is
a
showing
of
a
collateral
consequence
in
the
words
of
sibron
of
a
substantial
nature,
or
in
the
words
of
pollard
of
a
substantial
nature
that
we
would
create
even,
even
greater
backlog
that
would
require
those
people
who
are
now
languishing
in
jail
awaiting
the
culmination
of
all
of
their
appeals
that
were
required
then
to
stay
there
even
longer
--
mr.
francis
b.
burch
--
and
i
think
this
is
a
practical
question
that
we
must
adjust
ourselves
too.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
that's
correct.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
to
the
first
--
to
the
special
court
of
appeals
then
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
mr.
justice
fortas,
yes
i
do.
i
see
a
distinction
and
that
i
think
that
the
concurrent
sentencing
doctrine
should
be
under
all
circumstances
keep
viable
at
the
--
on
the
collateral
basis.
that
is
so
that
they
can't
go
in
under
the
habeas
corpus
in
to
the
federal
court
after
they
had
the
opportunity
to
do
it
at
the
on
the
direct
appeal
level.
i
believe
that
it
is
a
viable
doctrine
that
should
be
applied
on
direct
appeal
as
well
at
the
collateral
level
but
certainly
if
it
should
ever
come
to
pass
where
it
is
not
kept
at
the
direct
appeal
level
it
should
never
be
abandoned
and
so
far
as
the
collateral
level
is
concerned
because
at
least
that
opportunity
has
been
afforded
through
the
method
of
direct
appeal.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
it'
simply
gets
down
to
the
question
of
the
fact
that
the
defendants
in
many
instances
are
tried
on
multiple
counts.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
you
have
as
in
this
case
a
jury
trial,
multiple
counts.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
well
i
say
you
have
a
--
in
this
case
a
jury
question.
the
district
attorney
or
the
states
attorney,
as
we
call
them
in
maryland,
prepares
the
indictments
grand
jury
indicts
and
they
may
feel
that
they
cannot
be
press
at
that
at
the
then
state
of
investigation
that
they
may
be
able
to
prove
through
these
series
of
facts
that
there
was
burglary.
or
they
may
not
be
able
to
prove
all
of
the
elements
of
burglary
but
they
may
be
able
to
prove
the
elements
of
larceny
or
they
may
not
be
able
to
prove
all
of
the
elements
of
either
one
of
this
and
they
may
be
able
to
prove
the
elements
of
housebreaking
which
for
the
three
counts
needs
particular
indictments.
the
housebreaking
one
by
the
way
was
abandoned
on
both
instances
before
a
trial
took
place.
so,
now
you
have
the
case
go
to
the
jury
as
this
did
in
one
case
the
jury
came
in
guilty
as
to
count
burglary
not
guilty
as
to
larceny.
on
the
later
trial,
they
came
in
guilty
as
to
burglary,
guilty
as
to
larceny.
the
judges
now
in
the
position
of
imposing
the
sentence,
he
imposes
the
sentence
on
the
two
counts,
they
have
found
--
been
found
guilty
of
both.
he
opposes
the
sentence
on
the
two
counts.
both
of
these
cases
now
are
subject
to
appeal.
it
may
be
as
we
did
in
the
brady
case
where
they
found
the
first
count
to
be
defective
that
they
reversed
as
to
that
but
then
they
found
the
second
count
to
be
valid
and
therefore
the
imposition
of
the
sentence
was
upheld.
so
that
there
could
be
a
failure
on
the
part
of
the
state
to
prove
this
particular
aspect
of
that
particular
crime
as
alleged
in
the
indictment,
whereas
it
may
be
able
to
be
sustained
under
a
second
count
of
burglary.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
and
this
is
the
problem
that
they're
using
the
opportunity
to
try
to
--
on
the
basis
of
the
facts
have
a
valid
conviction
and
the
court
then
sentences
on
both.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
i
don't
really
believe
mr.
justice
that
this
is
the
philosophy
of
the
lower
court
judges
in
maryland.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
i
would
say
that
almost
invariably
the
federal
--
the
courts
in
maryland
when
there
are
multiple
counts
and
convictions
on
multiple
counts
of
rising
out
of
the
same
facts
and
circumstances
will
impose
concurrent
sentences.
it's
a
rare
thing,
a
very
rare
thing
to
read
where
the
court
below
has
imposed
sentences
on
these
multiple
counts
and
made
them
consecutive,
very
rare.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
well
we
had
it
in
the
meade
case.
i,
myself
don't
have
that
much
contact
with
the
lower
courts
to
be
able
to
evaluate
what
they
do
on
--
mr.
francis
b.
burch
mr.
borgerding
might
be
better
able
to
answer
this.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
this
--
there
could
have
been.
there
could
have
been
but
i
think
like
the
--
mr.
strauss,
the
solicitor
general
believes
i
think
that
the
rights
of
the
defendant
are
better
protected
by
the
concurrent
sentences
on
the
specific
counts
than
on
the
general
sentence.
and
i
would
hate
to
have
to
go
to
the
general
sentence
on
multiple
counts
when
i
think
the
rights
of
the
defendant
are
better
protected
on
this
specific
sentences
on
these
specific
counts.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
the
appellate
--
mr.
francis
b.
burch
well,
there
isn't
much
legal
literature
on
that.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
and
i
would
say
that
generally
the
courts
if
once
they
find
a
good
count
and
the
sentences
has
been
imposed
as,
let's
say
10
years
on
a
particular
count
unless
the
maximum
for
all
the
counts
that
they
won't
go
into
the
other
counts
because
it's
just
simply
a
matter
of
a
great
inconvenience.
the
court
would
have
to
write
an
opinion,
have
to
go
down
as
to
each
of
the
counts
and
it
would
end
up
by
being
extremely
difficult,
burdensome,
time-consuming
function
of
the
court
and
again
unless
there
can
be
shown
some
collateral
consequence
to
the
defendant.
i
believe
sincerely
that
it
serves
no
purpose
as
far
as
the
defendant
is
concerned.
it
serves
no
purposes
far
as
the
courts
are
concerned,
and
it
serves
a
great
disservice
as
far
as
the
other
defendants
who
may
be
languishing
in
jail
awaiting
the
disposition
of
their
cases
on
appeal
or
a
new
trial.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
well,
mr.
chief
justice
anything
is
possible
but
let
me
say
this
that
whatever
that
conviction
is,
it
is
reviewable
on
appeal.
and
if
all
of
those
four
counts
are
infected
with
some
error
because
they
did
not
mount
up
to
the
quantum
of
proof
that
the
law
requires,
then
they
all
would
be
reverse
on
appeal,
that's
the
first
thing.
the
second
thing
is
and
i
must
defend
the
right
of
the
district
attorney
to
have
the
indictments
handed
down
on
a
multiple
counts
because
let's
face
it
we
had
some
very
brilliant
defense
lawyers
who
are
at
the
bar
everyday.
and
if
they
can
use
the
technicality
of
the
law
whether
it
be
because
of
a
defect
in
the
indictment
or
a
defect
in
the
proof
or
one
little
scintilla
of
evidence
that
might
be
necessary,
absolutely
to
prove
this
particular
thing
they
are
in
a
position
to
find
every
single
one
of
these
doors
to
walk
out
of.
and
i
think
then
that
the
state
has
to
right
in
fact
it
has
the
duty
it
seems
to
me
to
have
the
opportunity
to
make
a
--
to
have
the
indictments
handed
down
in
such
a
way
that
if
in
fact
there
has
been
a
crime
committed
which
is
punishable
by
the
state.
and
they
can
offer
the
proof
which
will
stand
up
on
appeal
that
society
has
the
right
to
see
that
that
conviction
stands.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
i
agree
with
you
mr.
chief
justice
if
there
are
collateral
consequences
that
can
be
shown
to
have
been
imposed
upon
this
defendant
because
of
that
state
of
affairs
then
there
should
be
the
right
up
of
review.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
but
i
must
go
with
the
harmless
error
theory
of
my
brother,
mr.
strauss.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
mr.
chief
justice,
first
of
all
i
would
say
this
sir
that
there
is
no
question
about
it
but
if
he
asked
the
question
he
has
the
opportunity
to
explain
his
answer
and
if
i
were
the
defense
lawyer
and
a
prosecuting
attorney
were
to
try
to
pull
that
kind
of
a
trick
before
a
jury,
i'll
tell
you,
i'd
go
before
that
jury
with
the
greatest
argument
than
any
defendant
ever
had.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
it
would
be
foolishness
on
the
part
of
a
district
attorney
to
try
that
type
of
thing.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
mr.
chief
justice,
mr.
justices,
during
the
course
of
this
argument
the
attorney
for
the
petitioner
raised
the
question
as
to
whether
any
evidence
of
the
taking
of
goods
in
this
particular
case
should
have
been
admitted
in
to
evidence
because
of
his
claim
that
the
larceny
conviction
was
illegal,
void
because
of
double
jeopardy.
i
think
it
should
be
noted
that
under
the
law
of
maryland
indictment
dealing
with
burglary
was
the
entering,
breaking
and
entering
with
the
intent
to
steal,
and
evidence
was
introduced
to
show
that
goods
had
in
fact
been
taken
in
order
to
show
that
the
intent
to
steal
was
present
on
which
you
would
base
the
conviction
for
burglary.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it's
very
interesting
in
this
particular
case
because
the
place
that
the
defendant
entered
was
a
wednesday
club
that
actually
had
to
be
the
property
of
the
people
whose
goods
were
taken
but
it
was
called
the
wednesday
club,
i
believe
it
was.
and
people
came
and
went
and
when
he
was
first
accosted
in
the
place
he
claim
that
he
was
there
as
a
guest
of
the
wednesday
club
so
to
speak.
so
that
it
was
important
that
they
prove
not
only
the
breaking
and
the
entering
and
the
taking
of
goods
for
the
intent
but
in
case
they
weren't
able
to
prove
the
breaking
and
entering
that's
why
they
had
the
larceny
count
to
show
the
taking
of
the
goods.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
it
maybe
intent
to
steal.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
that's
all
you
have
to
prove.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
or
you
might
say
the
taking
of
the
goods.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
the
possession
of
the
goods
was
evidence
of
intent
because
the
best
evidence
of
intent
is,
tell
me
what
you've
done
and
i'll
tell
you
what
you
intended
to
do.
so
this
--
so
that
it
supports
it.
it
would
have
to
come
in
irrespective
of
whether
it
was
a
larceny
count
or
now
there's
still
would
have
to
come
in
order
to
properly
prove
the
burglary
count.
now,
let's
go
to
the
question
of
what
where
the
collateral
consequences
if
any
that
would
be
suffered
by
this
defendant
by
the
concurrent
sentencing.
the
first
thing
is
parole.
it
makes
no
difference
whether
he
is
in
for
10
years
or
15
years
plus
5
on
a
concurrent
basis
because
his
parole
rights
are
exactly
the
same.
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
read
s
the
solicitor
general
has
pointed
out
in
his
brief.
“when
the
parole
board
makes
a
determination
as
to
whether
parole
should
be
granted,
they
look
to
the
background
of
the
--
and
the
circumstances
of
the
crimes
committed,
the
conduct
and
so
on
and
so
forth
in
trying
to
determine
on
a
current
basis
whether
or
not
this
particular
inmate
may
make
a
good
parolee.”
under
the
law
of
maryland
which
is
in
article
41
section
111,
it
says
that
talking
about
the
board
of
parole.
“it
shall
be
the
duty
of
the
board
in
carrying
out
his
power
as
authorize
herein,
in
determining
whether
a
prisoner
is
suitable
for
release
on
parole,
(1)
to
consider
the
circumstances
surrounding
the
crime
and
the
physical
and
mental
qualifications
of
persons
who
eligible
for
parole.
(2)
to
determine
whether
there
is
reasonable
probability
that
the
prisoner
if
release
on
parole
will
remain
at
liberty
without
violating
the
laws
and
whether
the
release
of
the
prisoner
on
parole
is
compatible
with
the
welfare
of
the
society.”
and
that
is
the
test
that
just
is
to
be
applied
by
the
parole
board.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
conviction
of
larceny
would
absolutely
not
come
into
the
picture
at
all
in
determining
a
parole
because
they
would
go
to
the
facts
and
the
circumstances.
they
would
find
that
the
same
act
was
the
subject
matter
of
the
conviction
of
burglary
and
the
conviction
for
larceny.
so
they
take
the
facts
and
circumstances
as
directed
and
required
by
the
statute
and
they
apply
their
test
and
then
they
look
and
say
is
this
man
eligible?
is
this
man
a
good
risk
for
parole?
this
is
the
sole
thing
that
parole
board
would
be
required
to
consider.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
if
there
where
a
series
of
crimes
and
he
was
convicted
of
all
say
five
and
he
was
given
concurrent
sentences.
there
is
a
greater
likelihood
but
i
don't
believe
the
parole
board
in
maryland
at
least
would
consider
that
other
than
the
fact,
yes
they
would
consider
the
nature
of
the
person,
the
disposition
towards
multiple
crimes.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
so
that
on
the
series
of
crimes
i
think
probably
but
that
would
be
a
factor
that
would
be
involved
but
this
was
not
situation
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
yes.
impeaching
the
petitioner's
credibility,
well
as
mr.
cramer
pointed
out
in
his
argument
he
was
regretful
that
in
his
brief,
he
only
indicated
that
there
had
been
one
felony
conviction
of
this
particular
defendant.
i
refer
the
court
to
our
supplementary
brief
on
page
20
where
we
show
not
only
three
felonies
but
we
show
several
misdemeanors
and
plus
contempt
and
this
would
certainly
indicate
that
the
additional
conviction
on
larceny
under
the
same
facts
and
circumstance
of
the
conviction
of
burglary
would
have
absolutely
no
effect
whatsoever
on
the
impeachment
of
the
witness
in
his
credibility.
and
i
believe
i
gave
your
honor
mr.
chief
justice
an
example,
that
if
i
were
the
defendant's
lawyer
i
would
love
to
have
the
prosecuting
attorney
get
up
and
side
us,
make
two
crimes
out
of
this
thing
of
attacking
the
credibility
because
i
think
it
would
come
back
and
hit
him
right
in
his
face
if
i
may
use
of
an
active
verb.
affecting
the
sentencing
of
the
court,
i
think
it's
exactly
the
same
posture.
we're
not
talking
about
different
crimes
we're
talking
about
one
set
of
facts
and
circumstances
in
this
particular
case
and
i
don't
believe
that
there
would
have
one
iota
of
effect
on
the
court
in
so
far
as
future
sentencing
is
concerned.
ineligibility
for
licenses,
here
we
have
a
man
who
is
convicted
of
three
felonies,
several
misdemeanors
and
under
the
law
of
maryland
certain
licenses
are
not
--
you
cannot
get
certain
licenses
if
you
are
not
of
good
moral
character.
the
fact
that
he's
had
this
other
felony
convictions,
the
fact
that
he
was
no
convicted
of
burglary
and
that
this
other
concurrent
to
sentencing
for
rising
out
of
the
same
facts
of
circumstances
wouldn't
affect
one
iota
his
eligibility
for
licensing
because
he
wouldn't
be
eligible
because
he
wouldn't
be
of
good
moral
character
in
view
of
his
record.
the
right
to
vote,
he's
been
convicted
of
three
felonies,
he
wouldn't
have
the
right
to
vote
irrespective
of
what
happened
in
this
particular
case
and
the
same
thing
with
respect
to
the
right
to
serve
as
a
juror.
so
when
we
look
at
all
of
the
factors
in
this
particular
case,
the
goal
to
determine
and
to
give
us
some
indication
as
to
whether
there
is
a
reasonable
possibility.
unanimous
substantial
possibility
but
a
reasonable
possibility
that
this
concurrent
conviction,
this
concurrent
sentencing
might
have
an
adverse
effect
upon
him
or
collateral
consequences
as
far
as
he's
concerned,
the
answer
has
to
be
a
categorical
no
would
not
have
any
effect.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
i
don't
think
it
would
be
any
question
about
it.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
if
that
in
fact
were
the
case
your
honor,
yes
and
i
--
in
our
appreciation
as
we
have
set
forth
in
our
brief
and
as
i
say
here
--
mr.
francis
b.
burch
he
would
have
the
right
to
put
on
the
record
all
of
the
evidence
and
whatnot
--
mr.
francis
b.
burch
if
your
honor
please
it
may
well
be
that
this
court
might
feel
that
constitutional
rights
have
been
denied
and
if
so
then
that
will
be
a
proper
case
but
we
don't
kill
the
patient
in
order
to
cure
the
ill.
if
in
appropriate
case,
it's
been
shown
there's
been
an
abuse
then
there's
a
remedy
to
this
court
or
to
the
courts
of
the
state
towards
the
federal
courts.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
at
that
time.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
exactly
right,
your
honor
this
is
the
position
that
we
have
taken
both
in
our
brief
then
i
take
to
you
before
your
honors
today
that
we
recognize
that
there
are
certain
circumstances
whether
it
will
be
collateral
of
consequences
if
you
have
a
concurrent
sentencing
doctrine
which
is
applied
without
the
--
any
consideration
being
given
to
the
particular
facts
as
the
circumstances.
but
in
this
case,
there
isn't
one
single
scintilla
of
evidence
nor
is
there
one
single
argument
that
i
could
conceive
--
that
i
have
perceived
that
suggested
there
would
be
any
collateral
consequences
to
this
defendant.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
i
have
said
that
we
were
here
today
to
review
the
viability
of
the
concurrent
sentencing
doctrine.
we
take
the
position
that
it
is
viable,
it
is
still
viable,
it
is
important
and
so
far
as
the
administration
of
justice
and
the
expeditious
administration
of
justice
is
concerned.
but
there
are
circumstances
such
as
in
sibron
which
was
not
the
concurrent
sentencing
doctrine
but
to
mootness
doctrine.
but
there
are
circumstances
where
there
has
been
a
concession
that
there
has
been,
there
will
be
collateral
consequences
or
where
there
can
be
proof
shown
that
there
were
in
fact
a
lot
of
consequences
than
in
those
in
cases
there
should
be
a
remedy.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
well,
could
i
refer
the
court
to
have
that
brief
--
original
brief
that
says
all
six
questions
were
considered
by
the
court
although
the
opinion
may
not
deal
with
it.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
yes.
we'll
see
that
copy
of
the
opinion
is
submitted.
