justice
potter
stewart
your
certiorari
application
in
the
--
it's
not
in
the
appendix,
but
it
was
former
popus,
i
guess.
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
seem
to
have
it.
i'd
understood
you
had
not
raised
this
question
of
increased
punishment
explicitly
in
your
--
in
the
certiorari
petition.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
suppose
though
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
steps
you
set
out
in
your
brief:
one,
two,
three,
four,
five,
six.
justice
potter
stewart
on
the
bottom
of
page
21
and
the
top
of
22
of
your
brief
are
the
steps
that
you
represent
or
taken
in
this
case,
and
you
tell
us
that
there's
no
argument
about
the
fact
that
that
is
what
happened
in
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
those
six
steps.
justice
potter
stewart
and,
it's
on
that
that
you're
--
those
six
steps
that
you're
relying,
i
suppose,
to
--
for
your
submission
that
the
defendant
exercised
a
right
to
void
at
his
option
the
original
indictment.
justice
potter
stewart
i
was
talking
about
pages
21
and
22
of
your
brief.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
that
has
been
an
explicit
acquittal
by
the
jury
had
it
in
the
first
trial?
justice
potter
stewart
not
just
an
implicit
acquittal
by
finding
him
guilty
only
on
the
burglary?
justice
potter
stewart
he'd
been
sentenced
to
10
years
imprisonment,
the
first
trial?
justice
potter
stewart
second
time?
justice
potter
stewart
15
years
on
the
burglary
and
5
on
the
larceny
to
be
served
concurrently?
justice
potter
stewart
so
setting
aside
the
--
entirely
the
larceny
charge
he
was
sentenced
to
a
longer
term
on
retrial
on
the
burglary
charge.
justice
potter
stewart
you
didn't
raise
that
as
a
possible
error,
did
you?
justice
potter
stewart
was
he
given
credit
for
any
time
served
on
the
first
charge?
justice
potter
stewart
i
want
to
be
sure
i
understand
this
first
position
of
yours,
to
reverse
the
larceny
conviction
on
the
double
jeopardy
ground?
justice
potter
stewart
and
to
set
aside
the
burglary
conviction
and
order
a
new
trial
on
what
ground
that
it
was
infected
by
the
larceny?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
how
and
why?
justice
potter
stewart
why
and
how
it
did
so?
justice
potter
stewart
only
with
intent
to
steal
in
maryland,
can
it
be
with
intent
to
commit
any
other
felony
like
(voice
overlap)?
justice
potter
stewart
with
intent
to
steal.
justice
potter
stewart
i
--
would
be
understood
in
your
theory
because
i
think
--
as
i
understand
your
point,
if
your
preliminary
point
is
that
while
you've
been
asked
to
on
this
reargument
only
to
address
yourself
to
the
concurrent
sentence
question,
your
point
is
that
even
if
we
decide
that
the
concurrent
sentence
rule
has
continuing
validity
you
should
still
win.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
if
burglary
in
the
state
in
maryland
consists
of
whatever
it
is
breaking
and
entering
a
dwelling
house
than
night
time
for
it
with
the
intent
to
steal
and
if
you're
right
in
this
submission.
how
can
he
even
be
tried
for
burglary
again
if
the
state
isn't
allowed
to
show
that
he
had
the
intent
to
steal
on
the
retrial
of
the
burglary
charge?
justice
potter
stewart
and
what
cannot
they
do
in
your
submission?
justice
potter
stewart
on
the
retrial
of
the
burglary
charge?
justice
potter
stewart
well
it's
an
issue
in
the
burglary
case
as
you
tell
me
the
--
explain
the
definition
of
burglary
in
maryland,
there
has
to
be
an
attempt
to
steal.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that's
embraced
in
the
charge
of
burglary
as
i
understand
your
definition
of
it
in
your
state.
justice
potter
stewart
but
that's
a
different
double
jeopardy
point
of
this
i
understand
it.
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
tell
me
if
i'm
wrong,
that
point
is
on
the
burglary
conviction
alone
forgetting
all
about
the
larceny
conviction.
on
the
burglary
conviction
alone
he
was
given
a
greater
sentence
on
the
new
trial
after
new
trial
he
was
given
10
years
on
the
first
trial
and
15
years
on
the
second
trial.
that's
what's
involved
in
the
case
now
pending
in
the
fourth
circuit
and
by
contrast
these
case
involves
whether
or
not
he
could
be
tried
the
second
time
at
all
for
larceny
having
been
acquitted
the
first
time.
justice
potter
stewart
am
i
mistaken
about
that?
justice
potter
stewart
your
certiorari
application
in
the
--
it's
not
in
the
appendix,
but
it
was
former
popus,
i
guess.
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't

of

punishment
explicitly
in

justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
suppose
though
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
steps
you
set
out
in
your
brief:
one,
two,
three,
four,
five,
six.
justice

justice

stewart
those

justice
potter
stewart
and,
it's
on
that
that
you're
--
those
six
steps
that
you're
relying,
i
suppose,
to
--
for
your
submission
that
the
defendant
exercised
a

the

justice

stewart
i
was
talking
about
pages
21

of

justice

stewart
yes.
justice

justice

so
setting

the

he

on

charge.

justice

now,
how
and

justice

why
and
how
it
did
so?
justice

only

can
