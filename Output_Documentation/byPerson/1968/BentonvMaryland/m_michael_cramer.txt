mr.
m.
michael
cramer
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
before
the
court
today
on
a
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
maryland
court
of
appeals.
there
are
two
issues
in
the
case.
is
double
jeopardy
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment
applicable
to
the
states
to
the
fourteenth
amendment
and,
if
so,
was
the
petitioner
twice
put
in
jeopardy
in
this
case?
the
facts
of
the
case,
your
honor,
are
these.
the
state
of
maryland,
with
jurisdiction
to
do
so,
indicted
the
petitioner
for
three
alleged
violations
of
the
maryland
criminal
code:
burglary,
common
law
housebreaking,
and
larceny.
the
jury
returned
an
acquittal
on
the
larceny
charge.
the
state
dropped
the
housebreaking
charge.
jury
also
convicted
the
petitioner
on
the
burglary
case.
the
petitioner
then
appealed
the
burglary
case
to
the
maryland
court
of
appeals.
and,
the
maryland
court
of
appeals
remanded
petitioner's
conviction,
the
only
thing
before
it,
to
the
trial
court.
so
that,
the
petitioner
could
elect
to
have
the
conviction
set
aside.
the
remand
was
made
on
the
basis
of
schowgurow
versus
state
which
held
that
maryland's
constitutional
provision
requiring
all
jurors
to
profess
a
belief
in
god
or
swear
a
belief
in
god
was
in
violation
of
the
first
amendment
of
the
federal
constitution.
petitioner
went
to
the
trial
court
again.
he
was
indicted
again
for
burglary
and
common
law
housebreaking.
and,
because
he
sought
to
exercise
his
first
amendment
rights,
he
was
also
indicted
for
larceny
in
the
second
case.
in
the
first
case,
he
was
sentenced
to
10
years
imprisonment.
in
the
second
case,
he
was
convicted
this
time
of
both
burglary
and
larceny.
again,
the
state
dismissed
the
housebreaking
charge.
and,
as
a
result
of
the
second
trial,
the
trial
court
imposed
a
sentence
of
15
years
for
burglary,
5
years
for
larceny,
and
these
terms
to
be
served
concurrently.
prior
to
the
second
trial,
the
petitioner
dully
entered
his
objection
on
a
plea
of
all
the
fights
acquit,
but
the
prosecutor
argued
to
the
trial
court
that
the
petitioner
had
to
make
an
election.
either
he
could
allow
the
burglary
conviction
to
stand
or
else,
if
he
voided
the
burglary
conviction,
he
recreated
the
indictment
against
him
and
could
be
tried
on
all
charges.
they
were
prosecuted
against
him
in
the
original
indictment.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
he
was,
your
honor.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
the
original
indictment
had
a
fault
in
it,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
we
feel
that
the
larceny
conviction
was
such
an
unfair
--
retrial
of
larceny
was
such
an
unfair
procedure
that
this
vitiated
both
convictions,
your
honor.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
we
feel
that
it
should,
too,
your
honor.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
and
because,
also,
of
the
increased
penalty
in
the
second
trial,
your
honor.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
i
believe
so,
your
honor.
and,
we
rely
upon
a
decision
of
the
fourth
circuit
on
that
point.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
in
this
case,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
no,
your
honor.
that
is
--
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
no,
sir.
but,
the
state
of
maryland
has
decided
that
patton
versus
north
carolina
is
inapplicable
to
it,
the
increased
punishment.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
yes,
sir.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
but
i
believe
that
it
was.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
it
was
not
raised
well.
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
the
prosecutor
believed
--
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
--
yes,
sir?
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
no,
sir.
i
refer
to
it
being
specifically
raised
on
the
basis
of
patton
versus
north
carolina,
your
honor,
that
the
second
punishment
was
excessive.
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
the
prosecutor
set
forth
to
the
trial
court
the
gambling
theory,
that
is,
that
the
petitioner
had
to
gamble
against
himself.
the
decision
or
the
convictions
were
then
appealed
to
the
maryland
special
court
of
appeals,
a
court
enacted
to
have
jurisdiction
solely
of
criminal
cases
in
the
state
of
maryland.
and,
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
both
convictions,
essentially
on
the
grounds
that
no
jeopardy
attached
on
a
prosecution
based
on
a
faulty
indictment.
if
it
please
the
court,
it
is
the
petitioner's
position
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment
is
a
fundamental
principle
of
liberty
and
justice
and
is,
therefore,
applicable
to
the
states
either
by
incorporation
in
the
fourteenth
amendment
or
through
the
due
process
clause
in
the
sense
that
the
procedure
here
employed
by
the
state
was
violative
of
basic
fairness.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
no,
sir,
because
i
don't
believe
that
palko
sanctioned
this
type
of
procedure,
sir.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
your
honor,
i
respectfully
submit
that
the
court
also
carefully
set
out
that,
in
the
palko
case,
they
were
deciding
only
one
issue:
does
the
state
have
a
right
to
appeal?
and,
on
page
328
of
the
court's
decision
in
palko,
i
believe
that
the
court
leaves
open
the
question
that's
come
before
the
court
today
in
this
case.
of
course,
the
state
or
--
i'm
sorry,
sir.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
yes,
sir.
what
the
answer
would
have
to
be
if
the
state
were
permitted,
after
a
trial
free
for
murder,
to
try
the
accused
over
again
or
to
bring
another
case
against
him,
we
have
no
occasion
to
consider.
we
deal
with
the
statute
before
us
and
with
no
other.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
appeal
by
the
state.
the
state
appealed
an
alleged
error
in
trial.
the
case
was
reversed
and
a
new
trial
was
brought.
now
--
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
yes,
sir.
of
course,
it's
the
respondent's
position
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause
does
not
apply,
and
they
pitch
that
solely
on
this
court's
decision
in
palko
versus
connecticut.
but,
as
i've
stated,
your
honors,
we
are
convinced
that
palko
never
sanctioned
the
type
of
grossly
unfair
procedure
which
was
employed
by
the
state
in
this
case.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
yes,
sir.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
i
would
submit,
your
honor,
that
would
entitle
the
petitioner
to
a
new
trial
on
the
burglary
count
alone.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
you
mean,
your
honor,
had
he
been
prosecuted
for
larceny
and
burglary
and,
in
the
second
trial
--
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
yes,
sir.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
in
that
case,
it
would
be
limited
to
patton,
yes,
sir.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
a
new
sentence,
your
honor.
it
is
submitted
that
the
state
of
maryland
in
this
case
did
not
appear
to
the
federal
principle
for
the
application
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause,
and
i
refer
the
court
to
its
decision
in
united
states
versus
ball
which
is
the
most
basic
type
of
decision
that
can
be
considered
on
the
issue
of
double
jeopardy.
there,
it
was
held
that
the
double
jeopardy
attached
regardless
of
the
validity
of
the
indictment.
in
that
indictment
in
united
states
versus
ball,
was
no
more
invalid
than
the
indictment
in
the
petitioner's
case.
we
submit,
your
honors,
that
a
folly
indictment
constitutes
no
more
than
an
ordinary
trial
error.
and,
since
the
government
is
unable
to
undo
an
acquittal
because
of
an
ordinary
trial
error,
we
contend
the
--
that
they
should
not
be
able
to
set
aside
petitioner's
acquittal
in
this
case.
for
that
reason,
we
ask
the
court
to
reverse
this
entire
case
and
remand
it
for
a
new
trial
in
the
burglary
charge
alone.
thank
you
very
much,
your
honor.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
thank
you,
your
honor.
may
i
please
attempt
to
clear
up
one
area?
the
import
of
the
state's
argument
is
that
the
petitioner
knew
precisely
what
he
was
doing
on
the
remand
proceedings.
however,
the
material
cited
to
this
court
by
the
respondent
refutes
his
argument
rather
than
supports
it.
on
page
21
and
22
of,
the
respondent,
state
of
maryland's
brief,
there
are
cited
six
questions
that
were
to
be
asked
of
the
petitioner
on
the
remand
proceedings.
the
court
will
note
that,
among
the
six
questions,
there
is
no
question,
do
you
realize,
that
if
you
elect
to
be
retried,
your
previous
indictment
may
be
revived
and
you
may
be
charged
again
on
all
matters
even
those
of
which
you
were
preciously
acquitted.
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
to
support
that,
not
specifically
and
not
inferentially.
in
effect,
the
state
of
maryland
asked
this
court
to
believe
that,
on
the
remand
proceedings,
the
petitioner
would
anticipate
that
the
state
would
violate
the
most
basic
principles
of
double
jeopardy,
and
i
think
it's
wrong
to
believe
that
a
defendant
will
anticipate
that
the
state
will
do
wrong.
furthermore,
on
page
--
and
lastly,
on
page
2
and
3
of
the
joint
appendix,
we
note
on
page
2
that
the
defendant
challenges
the
array
of
the
grand
jury
on
june
30,
1966.
on
page
3,
we
note
that
his
trial
was
on
august
11,
1966.
it's
reasonable
to
infer
from
this
that
the
first
time
he
knew
that
he
would
be
charged
again
on
the
case
on
which
he
was
previously
acquitted
was
more
than
two
months
after
he
made
his
so-called
election.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
yes,
your
honor.
made
the
point
apparently
when
he
first
knew
of
it.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
well,
that,
your
honor,
i'll
say
that
judge
harvey
of
the
district
court
of
maryland
granted
our
petition
for
habeas
corpus
and
reduced
the
sentence
to
10
years,
but
the
state
has
appealed
that
decision.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
i
would
think,
in
light
of
that,
that
it
is
not,
your
honor.
and,
one
final
thing,
the
maryland
court
of
appeals,
in
its
remand
decision,
never
said
anything
about
acquittals,
never
said
anything
about
any
charges
other
than
the
one
of
which
he
stood
convicted.
they
said
“we
are
remanding
the
conviction.”
they
didn't
say
they
were
remanding
anything
more.
i
thank
you
very
much,
your
honors.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
was
argued
to
the
court
previously
on
december
12,
1968
on
the
issue
of
whether
the
double
jeopardy
provision
of
the
fifth
amendment
of
the
federal
constitution
was
applicable
to
the
state
of
maryland
to
the
fourteenth
amendment.
a
few
days
after
argument,
this
court
ordered
rehearing
and
rebriefing
on
another
issue.
that
issue
being,
“does
the
concurring
sentence
doctrine
enunciated
in
hirabayashi
versus
united
states
have
continuing
validity
in
light
of
such
other
decisions
in
more
recent
decisions
the
latest
case
being
sibron
versus
new
york?”
it
is
petitioner's
contention
that
the
hirabayashi
doctrine
is
invalid
today.
it
is
petitioner's
further
contention
that
the
court
need
not
reach
the
hirabayashi
rule
in
this
case
since
both
convictions
where
we
submit
invalid.
briefly,
the
facts
of
the
case
are
as
follows.
the
state
of
maryland
with
jurisdiction
to
do
so
indicted
the
petitioner
in
prince
george's
county
for
burglary,
common
law
housebreaking,
and
larceny.
common
law
housebreaking
charge
was
dismissed
by
the
prosecution.
the
jury
acquitted
the
petitioner
of
larceny
and
convicted
him
of
burglary.
petitioner
was
sentenced
to
serve
a
term
of
10
years
in
the
maryland
penitentiary.
he
appealed
his
burglary
conviction
and
the
maryland
court
of
appeals
remanded
the
conviction
when
the
basis
of
its
decision
in
schowgurow
versus
the
state
of
maryland
which
case
essentially
held
that
maryland's
constitutional
provision
which
excluded
jurors
unless
they
professed
to
believe
in
god
was
violative
of
the
first
amendment.
petitioner
chose
to
take
advantage
of
the
remand.
and
on
the
remand,
he
elected
to
be
retried
on
the
burglary
charge.
because
he
chose
to
take
advantage
of
this
first
amendment
rights,
the
petitioner
was
again
indicted
for
burglary
but
for
larceny
too
of
which
offense
he
was
previously
acquitted.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
yes,
your
honor,
it
was.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
that's
correct,
your
honor.
there
was
a
filing
of
not
guilty
by
the
jury
sir.
in
the
second
trial,
the
petitioner
was
convicted
of
both
burglary
and
larceny.
the
trial
court
sentenced
petitioner
to
a
term
of
15
years
for
burglary
and
5
years
for
larceny.
the
terms
were
ordered
to
be
served
concurrently.
pardon
me,
as
the
court
instructed
i
am
here
to
argue
the
question
of
the
validity
of
the
hirabayashi
concurrent
sentence
doctrine.
however
within
--
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
15
years,
your
honor.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
yes,
he
was
your
honor.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
no,
your
honor
that
--
the
question
of
increased
penalty
after
an
appeal
is
not
before
the
court,
it
was
not
raised
your
honor.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
i
don't
believe
he
was
your
honor.
with
the
court's
indulgence,
i
would
like
to
spend
a
brief
moment
stating
my
position
as
to
why
i
feel
that
the
court
need
not
reach
the
hirabayashi
rule
in
this
instant
case.
of
course,
the
hirabayashi
rule
presumes
that
one
conviction
is
valid
and
the
other
is
invalid.
in
this
case
we
believe
that
the
invalid
larceny
conviction
infected
the
burglary
charge
and
therefore
the
burglary
was
invalid
also.
in
united
states
versus
trenton
potteries,
this
court
held
that
it
would
affirm
an
invalid
conviction
in
which
concurrent
sentences
were
rendered
only
if
the
jury's
consideration
of
the
valid
count
was
not
prejudiced
by
their
consideration
of
the
invalid
count.
presuming
that
petitioner
second
prosecution
for
larceny
was
constitutionally
impermissible,
the
unfairness
of
charging
and
trying
him
a
second
time,
we
submit
infected
the
entire
proceeding
and
invalidated
the
burglary
as
well
as
the
larceny
conviction.
and
therefore,
we
ultimately
asked
the
court
to
reverse
the
larceny
conviction
and
order
a
new
trial
in
the
burglary
case.
addressing
myself
now
to
the
question
certified
by
the
court.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
that
the
institution
of
the
larceny
charge
in
the
second
case--
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
--
infected
and
prejudiced
the
defendant,
the
petitioner
before
your
court
your
honor,
in
his
burglary
defense
and
therefore
--
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
i'm
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
for
several
reasons.
one,
under
the
law
of
the
state
of
maryland,
burglary
consists
of
breaking
and
entering
a
dwelling
house
with
intent
to
steal.
if
the
--
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
no,
your
honor.
it's
with
the
intent
to
steal.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
therefore,
may
i
--
i
hope
appropriately
state
that
i
have
other
reasons
but
if
the
court
would
like
other
reasons
why
the
burglary
charge
was
infected
but
if
the
court
would
--
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
that's
correct
sir.
in
this
case,
the
state
of
maryland
to
conduct
the
prosecution
successfully
had
to
prove
that
benton
intended
to
steal
when
he
entered
the
premises.
in
the
first
trial
it
was
adjudicated
that
he
did
not
intent
to
steal.
we
contend
that
this
was
res
judicata
under
the
sealfon
case
that
this
principle
applies
in
criminal
cases
and
that
therefore
he
was
entitled
to
have
excluded
and
he
mentioned
in
any
evidence
of
a
larceny.
thus,
the
state
obtained
an
advantage
that
they
ordinarily
would
not
have
had
in
proving
intent.
secondly,
your
honor,
the
necessity
of
defending
two
rather
that
one
charge
has
technically
disadvantaged
the
petitioner.
another
reason
why
we
feel
that
the
burglary
charge
is
invalid
is
that
the
state
in
this
case
used
the
device
of
cumulating
as
many
charges
as
it
could
so
as
to
promote
a
compromise
atmosphere
in
the
jury
room
and
cause
the
jury
to
convict
him
of
at
least
one,
although
of
course
in
this
case
he
was
convicted
of
two.
we
also
submit
that
another
reason
why
he
was
prejudiced
and
why
the
burglary
conviction
should
be
reversed
is
that
the
jury
was
permitted
to
consider
prejudicially
irrelevant
testimony
because
again
benton
had
a
right
to
have
the
jury
not
consider
any
evidence
of
larceny
in
view
of
his
first
acquittal
and
the
doctrine
of
res
judicata.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
well,
i
submit
your
honor
that
they
could
endeavor
to
prove
the
intent
to
steal
by
other
means.
perhaps
a
conversation,
perhaps
burglary
tools,
none
of
which
where
present
in
this
case
but
this
is
one
of
our
points
your
honor.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
we
feel
that
they
--
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
we
feel
that
they
could
not
show
that
anything
was
missing
from
the
premises
after
benton
had
left
the
premises
because
that
is
the
issue
the
in
the
larceny
case
and
the
larceny
case
was
adjudicated
in
his
favor.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
yes.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
the
question
then
your
honor
comes
before
the
court
of
if
they
did
not
charge
larceny
could
they
have
shown
that
items
were
--
of
personal
property
were
missing
from
the
premises
just
on
the
burglary
charge
alone
and
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
answer
to
that
is
no.
whereas
they
might
have
been
able
under
ordinary
circumstance
to
show
that
an
asportation
had
taken
place,
they
couldn't
once
this
matter
was
adjudicated
in
his
favor.
oh,
we
also
submit
that
there
are
certain
cases
that
decided
by
this
court
that
hold
that
even
though
there
is
no
isolatable
prejudice,
if
prejudice
does
permeate
the
trial
then
the
entire
preceding
is
officiated
and
we
respectfully
submit
as
out
last
ground
that
is
another
reason
why
the
burglary
conviction
should
be
set
aside.
thank
you
your
honor
and
turning
now
to
the
issue
before
the
court
it
was
petitioners'
contention
if
the
court
please
that
the
hirabayashi
concurrent
sentence
doctrine
no
longer
has
validity
in
view
of
sibron
versus
new
york
which
case
involved
the
petitioner
whose
criminal
record
and
background
was
similar
to
the
petitioners
in
the
instant
case.
as
a
result
of
the
sibron
decision,
it
is
incumbent
upon
the
government
to
show
that
no
possibility
of
collateral
legal
consequences
will
be
imposed
on
the
basis
of
the
challenged
conviction.
i
believe
that
sibron
makes
it
clear
that
the
fact
that
a
petitioner
has
a
substantial
criminal
record
does
not
in
itself
mean
that
there
are
no
significant
collateral
legal
consequences.
it
is
submitted
that
the
rational
of
the
sibron
case
is
equally
persuasive
in
the
petitioner's
case
and
additional
fact
in
favor
of
abolishment
of
the
hirabayashi
rule
in
the
case
of
concurrent
sentences
is
the
consequences
that
may
occur
where
a
valid
conviction
is
set
aside
at
a
remote
time
for
such
reason
as
newly
discovered
evidence.
in
that
case,
the
defendant's
evidence
may
be
stale.
he
may
be
unable
to
locate
and
master
his
witnesses
and
thus
unable
to
vindicate
himself
and
therefore
we
submit
that
the
concurrent
sentence
case
it
is
even
the
sibron
rule
is
even
more
applicable.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
i'm
sorry
your
honor
but
i
do
not
however
i
do
note
that
the
recidivist
statutes
used
the
word
conviction
and
most
of
them
do
not
refer
to
multiple
convictions
but
just
leave
it
at
that.
although,
under
the
sibron
case
it
is
not
incumbent
upon
the
petitioner
to
establish
the
collateral
legal
consequences,
if
it
please
the
court,
i
might
venture
to
mention
one.
regrettably,
due
to
misinformation
the
petitioner's
brief
states
that
he
has
only
one
felony
conviction,
when
actually
it
appears
that
he
has
three
felony
convictions.
however,
the
petitioner's
background
does
have
some
redeeming
features.
following
two
of
his
felony
convictions,
petitioners
served
with
distinction
in
the
united
states
army.
he
was
a
decorated
soldier,
a
recipient
of
the
purple
heart
and
to
this
day
receives
a
veteran's
administration
service
connected
disability.
perhaps,
some
future
administrative
body
or
judge
will
consider
the
petitioner's
meritorious
military
record
but
will
find
that
the
invalid
larceny
conviction
militates
against
favorable
consideration.
in
this
case,
the
petitioner
does
not
seek
a
declaration
in
the
air.
he
has
a
substantial
interest
in
the
outcome
of
this
litigation.
there
is
nothing
abstract
thing
or
hypothetical
about
this
--
his
appeal.
it
is
submitted
that
another
reason
exists
for
not
applying
the
hirabayashi
doctrine
in
this
case.
the
state
of
maryland
does
not
follow
the
hirabayashi
rule
but
instead
allows
the
court
to
correct
and
set
aside
an
invalid
conviction
at
any
time
regardless
of
its
immediate
impact
upon
the
defendant.
following
this
rule,
the
maryland
court
of
appeals
has
on
many
occasions
reversed
invalid
convictions
when
the
sentences
were
ordered
to
be
served
concurrently
with
a
valid
conviction.
we
submit
that
application
of
a
state
remedy
to
a
case
involving
a
violation
of
a
federal
constitutional
provision
is
not
noble.
in
brady
versus
maryland,
this
court
held
that
the
state
of
maryland
violated
a
petitioner's
right
to
due
process
of
law
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
when
it
withheld
from
him
exculpatory
information.
at
the
same
time,
however,
this
court
held
that
they
use
to
which
this
exculpatory
information
would
be
put
was
to
be
determines
by
the
law
of
the
state
of
maryland
rather
than
the
federal
law.
the
solicitor
general
recognizes
that
the
government
under
the
doctrine
of
sibron
cannot
possibly
negate
the
existence
of
all
collateral
consequences.
and
the
solicitor
general
meets
the
problem
by
stating
that
the
rule
in
sibron
versus
new
york
requiring
the
government
to
show
that
no
possible
legal
collateral
consequences
exists
should
not
apply
in
the
case
of
concurrent
sentences.
however,
it
is
respectfully
submitted
to
the
court
that
the
solicitor
general
offers
no
cogent
reason
for
distinguishing
the
situation
where
sentences
have
been
served
from
the
situation
where
sentences
are
to
be
served
concurrently
as
in
the
instant
case.
the
maryland
attorney
general
approaches
the
problem
differently
by
stating
that
his
brief
raises
and
negates
the
existence
of
all
possible
collateral
consequences
that
might
confront
the
petitioner.
since
collateral
consequences
are
often
unpredictable,
we
submit
that
the
state
lacks
such
extraordinary
perception
in
this
case.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
yes,
sir.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
we
submit
to
your
honor
that
is
incumbent
upon
the
state,
that
the
state
has
the
burden
of
negating
the
existence
of
all
possible
collateral
legal
consequences.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
yes,
sir.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
yes,
your
honor.
in
conclusion
with
respect
--
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
yes
sir.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
your
honor,
i've
attempted
to
answer
one
when
i
state
and
refer,
alluded
to
(voice
overlap).
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
that
is
on
of
them,
your
honor.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
i'm
sorry,
sir?
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
it
might
be
but
it
certainly
will
(voice
overlap).
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
i
believe
that
the
parole
consequences
are
involved
in
this
case
--
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
under
the
maryland
law,
the
district
attorney
of
the
county
in
which
the
case
is
tried
has
--
must
certify
to
the
parole
department
an
abstract
of
each
case
in
which
a
conviction
was
rendered.
now,
i
submit
to
the
court
that
is
a
factor
which
governs
or
guides,
or
helps
to
guide
the
parole
authorities
in
determining
the
illegibility
for
parole.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
yes,
sir.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
i
believe
that
it's
possible,
your
honor.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
possibility
--
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
the
factor
that
i
mentioned
about
his
past
record.
his
conviction
says
two
felony
convictions
are
very
old,
one
when
he
was
39
and
one
in
40.
one
was
when
he
was
16
years
of
age
before
there
was
a
juvenile
delinquency
law.
i
believe
that
it's
difficult
to
anticipate
what
a
future
administrative
body
or
what
a
future
judge
will
think
of
his
record.
certainly
your
honor,
conviction
of
two
crimes
cannot
help
him
as
compared
to
one.
may
it
please
the
court
in
conclusion
for
the
reason
stated;
we
respectfully
request
the
court
to
order
reversal
of
the
larceny
conviction
and
order
a
new
trial
from
the
burglary
charge.
i
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
just
a
few
matters
if
you
please
for
rebuttal.
the
--
both
the
solicitor
general
of
the
united
states
and
maryland's
attorney
general
had
argued
that
the
abandonment
of
the
concurrent
sentence
doctrine
would
unnecessarily
burden
the
administration
of
justice.
however,
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
the
experience
of
the
maryland
courts
of
appeal
which
often
review
all
convictions
whether
sentences
were
concurrently
served
or
not
does
not
indicate
that
the
courts
workload
has
become
unbearable
because
of
its
review
of
invalid
as
well
as
valid
convictions.
if
there
is
no
doubt
your
honors
but
the
maryland's
higher
courts
of
appeals
and
highest
courts
review
convictions
in
which
the
terms
are
ordered
to
be
served
concurrently.
i
have
the
volumes
here.
i
can
quote
from
them
and
cite
the
cases,
many
of
them
all
the
ones
that
i've
reviewed
in
fact
deal
with
situations
where
two
sentences
were
imposed
as
a
result
of
one
criminal
transaction.
in
other
words
situations
eminently
analogous
to
the
situation
which
petitioner
is
presently
in.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
i
believe
the
double
jeopardy
argument
would
still
be
before
the
court
your
honor.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
both
the
court
--
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
well,
i
believe
that
double
jeopardy
argument
as
a
matter
of
justice
sir
must
be
dispose
of
in
this
case,
yes
sir.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
if
the
court
your
honor
held
that
the
larceny
conviction
was
invalid.
we
respectfully
submit
that
they
can
reach
it
regardless
of
the
fact
that
it
was
a
concurring
sentence
because
we
feel
that
the
doctrine
enunciated
in
the
suit
case
of
sibron
versus
new
york
should
be
applicable
to
this
case.
moreover,
we
contend
and
respectfully
request
that
this
court
void
both
convictions
because
of
the
prejudice
that
was
inherent
in
the
trial.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
yes,
sir.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
i
believe
it
has
no
effect,
your
honor.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
were
the
court
to
reject
the
petitioner's
appeal
in
this
case
according
to
the
order
of
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
maryland,
benton
will
serve
no
more
than
10
years
in
prison.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
that's
because
--
yes,
sir,
it's
because
of
the
former
jeopardy
point
that
reached
the
question
of
whether
double
jeopardy
attached
where
after
in
a
success
of
prosecution
the
defendant
received
an
increase
penalty.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
we
did
not
raise
the
point,
your
honor.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
yes.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
yes,
sir.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
not
at
all.
that
is
correct.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
no,
your
honor.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
the
limited
double
of
jeopardy
argument
of
increased
penalty
on
a
second
trial.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
yes
sir
and
that
was
based
on
the
case
of
patton
versus
north
carolina,
fourth
circuit
case
which
held
that
was
another
form
of
double
jeopardy.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
the
district
court
was
apprised
of
the
fact
that
i
had
this
case
pending
before
this
court.
the
--
excuse
me
--
the
--
in
--
mr.
burch
speaking
for
the
state
of
maryland
states
that
in
the
sibron
case,
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
new
york
stated
to
this
court
at
least
in
his
brief
stated
to
the
court
that
collateral
consequences
did
in
fact
exists
in
mr.
sibron's
case.
i
have
before
me,
your
honor
volume
number
25
of
the
transcript
of
records
and
file
copies
of
briefs
on
file
on
this
court.
and
i
note
that
from
the
state
of
new
york's
supplementary
--
respondent's
supplemental
brief
the
attorney
general
attempts
to
negate
probable
collateral
legal
consequences
rather
than
admit
that
they
exist.
and
of
course
this
court
did
not
accept
the
new
york
attorney
general's
argument
in
the
sibron
case.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
no,
but
they
do
have
appeal
where
the
judge
acquits
him.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
the
jury
your
honor.
the
--
i
would
like
to
respectfully
point
out
to
the
court
that
the
petitioner's
criminal
record
is
substantially
similar
to
the
criminal
record
which
mr.
nelson
sibron
had
in
the
case
of
sibron
versus
new
york.
and
that
there
are
no
cogent
reasons
for
distinguishing
this
petitioner
situation
from
the
situation
that
sibron
was
in.
on
behalf
of
the
petitioner,
i
respectfully
thank
the
court
for
the
great
consideration
they
have
given
to
this
case.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
excuse
me
mr.
chief
justice,
but
may
i
address
the
court
for
one
more
moment
on
--
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
i
thank
you
very
much.
i
would
like
to
make
clear
your
honors
the
question
of
what
happened
in
the
remand.
on
page
2
and
3
of
the
appendix
filed
with
this
court.
the
third
paragraph
shows
that
on
june
30,
1966,
the
defendant
challenged
the
array
of
the
grand
jurors.
in
other
words,
he
exercised
his
right
to
have
his
burglary
conviction
set
aside.
it
was
until
two
months
later
as
revealed
on
page
3
of
the
appendix
that
he
was
indicted
on
the
larceny
as
well
as
the
burglary
conviction.
so
it
cannot
be
said
on
the
basis
of
this
record
that
at
the
time
he
made
his
election
which
was
june
30,
1966
that
he
knew
of
the
dire
consequences
that
would
face
him
if
he
took
advantage
of
his
first
amendment
rights.
therefore
your
honor,
the
second
trial
for
the
larceny
as
well
as
the
burglary
was
unfair
from
the
very
beginning.
thank
you.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
before
the
court
today
on
a
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
maryland
court
of
appeals.
there
are
two
issues
in
the
case.
is
double
jeopardy
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment
applicable
to
the
states
to
the
fourteenth
amendment
and,
if
so,
was
the
petitioner
twice
put
in
jeopardy
in
this
case?
the
facts
of
the
case,
your
honor,
are
these.
the
state
of
maryland,
with
jurisdiction
to
do
so,
indicted
the
petitioner
for
three
alleged
violations
of
the
maryland
criminal
code:
burglary,
common
law
housebreaking,
and
larceny.
the
jury
returned
an
acquittal
on
the
larceny
charge.
the
state
dropped
the
housebreaking
charge.
jury
also
convicted
the
petitioner
on
the
burglary
case.
the
petitioner
then
appealed
the
burglary
case
to
the
maryland
court
of
appeals.
and,
the
maryland
court
of
appeals
remanded
petitioner's
conviction,
the
only
thing
before
it,
to
the
trial
court.
so
that,
the
petitioner
could
elect
to
have
the
conviction
set
aside.
the
remand
was
made
on
the
basis
of
schowgurow
versus
state
which
held
that
maryland's
constitutional
provision
requiring
all
jurors
to
profess
a
belief
in
god
or
swear
a
belief
in
god
was
in
violation
of
the
first
amendment
of
the
federal
constitution.
petitioner
went
to
the
trial
court
again.
he
was
indicted
again
for
burglary
and
common
law
housebreaking.
and,
because
he
sought
to
exercise
his
first
amendment
rights,
he
was
also
indicted
for
larceny
in
the
second
case.
in
the
first
case,
he
was
sentenced
to
10
years
imprisonment.
in
the
second
case,
he
was
convicted
this
time
of
both
burglary
and
larceny.
again,
the
state
dismissed
the
housebreaking
charge.
and,
as
a
result
of
the
second
trial,
the
trial
court
imposed
a
sentence
of
15
years
for
burglary,
5
years
for
larceny,
and
these
terms
to
be
served
concurrently.
prior
to
the
second
trial,
the
petitioner
dully
entered
his
objection
on
a
plea
of
all
the
fights
acquit,
but
the
prosecutor
argued
to
the
trial
court
that
the
petitioner
had
to
make
an
election.
either
he
could
allow
the
burglary
conviction
to
stand
or
else,
if
he
voided
the
burglary
conviction,
he
recreated
the
indictment
against
him
and
could
be
tried
on
all
charges.
they
were
prosecuted
against
him
in
the
original
indictment.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
he
was,
your
honor.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
the
original
indictment
had
a
fault
in
it,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
we
feel
that
the
larceny
conviction
was
such
an
unfair
--
retrial
of
larceny
was
such
an
unfair
procedure
that
this
vitiated
both
convictions,
your
honor.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
we
feel
that
it
should,
too,
your
honor.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
and
because,
also,
of
the
increased
penalty
in
the
second
trial,
your
honor.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
i
believe
so,
your
honor.
and,
we
rely
upon
a
decision
of
the
fourth
circuit
on
that
point.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
in
this
case,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
no,
your
honor.
that
is
--
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
no,
sir.
but,
the
state
of
maryland
has
decided
that
patton
versus
north
carolina
is
inapplicable
to
it,
the
increased
punishment.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
yes,
sir.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
but
i
believe
that
it
was.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
it
was
not
raised
well.
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
the
prosecutor
believed
--
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
--
yes,
sir?
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
no,
sir.
i
refer
to
it
being
specifically
raised
on
the
basis
of
patton
versus
north
carolina,
your
honor,
that
the
second
punishment
was
excessive.
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
the
prosecutor
set
forth
to
the
trial
court
the
gambling
theory,
that
is,
that
the
petitioner
had
to
gamble
against
himself.
the
decision
or
the
convictions
were
then
appealed
to
the
maryland
special
court
of
appeals,
a
court
enacted
to
have
jurisdiction
solely
of
criminal
cases
in
the
state
of
maryland.
and,
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
both
convictions,
essentially
on
the
grounds
that
no
jeopardy
attached
on
a
prosecution
based
on
a
faulty
indictment.
if
it
please
the
court,
it
is
the
petitioner's
position
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment
is
a
fundamental
principle
of
liberty
and
justice
and
is,
therefore,
applicable
to
the
states
either
by
incorporation
in
the
fourteenth
amendment
or
through
the
due
process
clause
in
the
sense
that
the
procedure
here
employed
by
the
state
was
violative
of
basic
fairness.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
no,
sir,
because
i
don't
believe
that
palko
sanctioned
this
type
of
procedure,
sir.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
your
honor,
i
respectfully
submit
that
the
court
also
carefully
set
out
that,
in
the
palko
case,
they
were
deciding
only
one
issue:
does
the
state
have
a
right
to
appeal?
and,
on
page
328
of
the
court's
decision
in
palko,
i
believe
that
the
court
leaves
open
the
question
that's
come
before
the
court
today
in
this
case.
of
course,
the
state
or
--
i'm
sorry,
sir.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
yes,
sir.
what
the
answer
would
have
to
be
if
the
state
were
permitted,
after
a
trial
free
for
murder,
to
try
the
accused
over
again
or
to
bring
another
case
against
him,
we
have
no
occasion
to
consider.
we
deal
with
the
statute
before
us
and
with
no
other.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
appeal
by
the
state.
the
state
appealed
an
alleged
error
in
trial.
the
case
was
reversed
and
a
new
trial
was
brought.
now
--
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
yes,
sir.
of
course,
it's
the
respondent's
position
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause
does
not
apply,
and
they
pitch
that
solely
on
this
court's
decision
in
palko
versus
connecticut.
but,
as
i've
stated,
your
honors,
we
are
convinced
that
palko
never
sanctioned
the
type
of
grossly
unfair
procedure
which
was
employed
by
the
state
in
this
case.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
yes,
sir.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
i
would
submit,
your
honor,
that
would
entitle
the
petitioner
to
a
new
trial
on
the
burglary
count
alone.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
you
mean,
your
honor,
had
he
been
prosecuted
for
larceny
and
burglary
and,
in
the
second
trial
--
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
yes,
sir.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
in
that
case,
it
would
be
limited
to
patton,
yes,
sir.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
a
new
sentence,
your
honor.
it
is
submitted
that
the
state
of
maryland
in
this
case
did
not
appear
to
the
federal
principle
for
the
application
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause,
and
i
refer
the
court
to
its
decision
in
united
states
versus
ball
which
is
the
most
basic
type
of
decision
that
can
be
considered
on
the
issue
of
double
jeopardy.
there,
it
was
held
that
the
double
jeopardy
attached
regardless
of
the
validity
of
the
indictment.
in
that
indictment
in
united
states
versus
ball,
was
no
more
invalid
than
the
indictment
in
the
petitioner's
case.
we
submit,
your
honors,
that
a
folly
indictment
constitutes
no
more
than
an
ordinary
trial
error.
and,
since
the
government
is
unable
to
undo
an
acquittal
because
of
an
ordinary
trial
error,
we
contend
the
--
that
they
should
not
be
able
to
set
aside
petitioner's
acquittal
in
this
case.
for
that
reason,
we
ask
the
court
to
reverse
this
entire
case
and
remand
it
for
a
new
trial
in
the
burglary
charge
alone.
thank
you
very
much,
your
honor.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
thank
you,
your
honor.
may
i
please
attempt
to
clear
up
one
area?
the
import
of
the
state's
argument
is
that
the
petitioner
knew
precisely
what
he
was
doing
on
the
remand
proceedings.
however,
the
material
cited
to
this
court
by
the
respondent
refutes
his
argument
rather
than
supports
it.
on
page
21
and
22
of,
the
respondent,
state
of
maryland's
brief,
there
are
cited
six
questions
that
were
to
be
asked
of
the
petitioner
on
the
remand
proceedings.
the
court
will
note
that,
among
the
six
questions,
there
is
no
question,
do
you
realize,
that
if
you
elect
to
be
retried,
your
previous
indictment
may
be
revived
and
you
may
be
charged
again
on
all
matters
even
those
of
which
you
were
preciously
acquitted.
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
to
support
that,
not
specifically
and
not
inferentially.
in
effect,
the
state
of
maryland
asked
this
court
to
believe
that,
on
the
remand
proceedings,
the
petitioner
would
anticipate
that
the
state
would
violate
the
most
basic
principles
of
double
jeopardy,
and
i
think
it's
wrong
to
believe
that
a
defendant
will
anticipate
that
the
state
will
do
wrong.
furthermore,
on
page
--
and
lastly,
on
page
2
and
3
of
the
joint
appendix,
we
note
on
page
2
that
the
defendant
challenges
the
array
of
the
grand
jury
on
june
30,
1966.
on
page
3,
we
note
that
his
trial
was
on
august
11,
1966.
it's
reasonable
to
infer
from
this
that
the
first
time
he
knew
that
he
would
be
charged
again
on
the
case
on
which
he
was
previously
acquitted
was
more
than
two
months
after
he
made
his
so-called
election.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
yes,
your
honor.
made
the
point
apparently
when
he
first
knew
of
it.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
well,
that,
your
honor,
i'll
say
that
judge
harvey
of
the
district
court
of
maryland
granted
our
petition
for
habeas
corpus
and
reduced
the
sentence
to
10
years,
but
the
state
has
appealed
that
decision.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
i
would
think,
in
light
of
that,
that
it
is
not,
your
honor.
and,
one
final
thing,
the
maryland
court
of
appeals,
in
its
remand
decision,
never
said
anything
about
acquittals,
never
said
anything
about
any
charges
other
than
the
one
of
which
he
stood
convicted.
they
said
“we
are
remanding
the
conviction.”
they
didn't
say
they
were
remanding
anything
more.
i
thank
you
very
much,
your
honors.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
was
argued
to
the
court
previously
on
december
12,
1968
on
the
issue
of
whether
the
double
jeopardy
provision
of
the
fifth
amendment
of
the
federal
constitution
was
applicable
to
the
state
of
maryland
to
the
fourteenth
amendment.
a
few
days
after
argument,
this
court
ordered
rehearing
and
rebriefing
on
another
issue.
that
issue
being,
“does
the
concurring
sentence
doctrine
enunciated
in
hirabayashi
versus
united
states
have
continuing
validity
in
light
of
such
other
decisions
in
more
recent
decisions
the
latest
case
being
sibron
versus
new
york?”
it
is
petitioner's
contention
that
the
hirabayashi
doctrine
is
invalid
today.
it
is
petitioner's
further
contention
that
the
court
need
not
reach
the
hirabayashi
rule
in
this
case
since
both
convictions
where
we
submit
invalid.
briefly,
the
facts
of
the
case
are
as
follows.
the
state
of
maryland
with
jurisdiction
to
do
so
indicted
the
petitioner
in
prince
george's
county
for
burglary,
common
law
housebreaking,
and
larceny.
common
law
housebreaking
charge
was
dismissed
by
the
prosecution.
the
jury
acquitted
the
petitioner
of
larceny
and
convicted
him
of
burglary.
petitioner
was
sentenced
to
serve
a
term
of
10
years
in
the
maryland
penitentiary.
he
appealed
his
burglary
conviction
and
the
maryland
court
of
appeals
remanded
the
conviction
when
the
basis
of
its
decision
in
schowgurow
versus
the
state
of
maryland
which
case
essentially
held
that
maryland's
constitutional
provision
which
excluded
jurors
unless
they
professed
to
believe
in
god
was
violative
of
the
first
amendment.
petitioner
chose
to
take
advantage
of
the
remand.
and
on
the
remand,
he
elected
to
be
retried
on
the
burglary
charge.
because
he
chose
to
take
advantage
of
this
first
amendment
rights,
the
petitioner
was
again
indicted
for
burglary
but
for
larceny
too
of
which
offense
he
was
previously
acquitted.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
yes,
your
honor,
it
was.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
that's
correct,
your
honor.
there
was
a
filing
of
not
guilty
by
the
jury
sir.
in
the
second
trial,
the
petitioner
was
convicted
of
both
burglary
and
larceny.
the
trial
court
sentenced
petitioner
to
a
term
of
15
years
for
burglary
and
5
years
for
larceny.
the
terms
were
ordered
to
be
served
concurrently.
pardon
me,
as
the
court
instructed
i
am
here
to
argue
the
question
of
the
validity
of
the
hirabayashi
concurrent
sentence
doctrine.
however
within
--
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
15
years,
your
honor.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
yes,
he
was
your
honor.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
no,
your
honor
that
--
the
question
of
increased
penalty
after
an
appeal
is
not
before
the
court,
it
was
not
raised
your
honor.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
i
don't
believe
he
was
your
honor.
with
the
court's
indulgence,
i
would
like
to
spend
a
brief
moment
stating
my
position
as
to
why
i
feel
that
the
court
need
not
reach
the
hirabayashi
rule
in
this
instant
case.
of
course,
the
hirabayashi
rule
presumes
that
one
conviction
is
valid
and
the
other
is
invalid.
in
this
case
we
believe
that
the
invalid
larceny
conviction
infected
the
burglary
charge
and
therefore
the
burglary
was
invalid
also.
in
united
states
versus
trenton
potteries,
this
court
held
that
it
would
affirm
an
invalid
conviction
in
which
concurrent
sentences
were
rendered
only
if
the
jury's
consideration
of
the
valid
count
was
not
prejudiced
by
their
consideration
of
the
invalid
count.
presuming
that
petitioner
second
prosecution
for
larceny
was
constitutionally
impermissible,
the
unfairness
of
charging
and
trying
him
a
second
time,
we
submit
infected
the
entire
proceeding
and
invalidated
the
burglary
as
well
as
the
larceny
conviction.
and
therefore,
we
ultimately
asked
the
court
to
reverse
the
larceny
conviction
and
order
a
new
trial
in
the
burglary
case.
addressing
myself
now
to
the
question
certified
by
the
court.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
that
the
institution
of
the
larceny
charge
in
the
second
case--
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
--
infected
and
prejudiced
the
defendant,
the
petitioner
before
your
court
your
honor,
in
his
burglary
defense
and
therefore
--
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
i'm
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
for
several
reasons.
one,
under
the
law
of
the
state
of
maryland,
burglary
consists
of
breaking
and
entering
a
dwelling
house
with
intent
to
steal.
if
the
--
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
no,
your
honor.
it's
with
the
intent
to
steal.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
therefore,
may
i
--
i
hope
appropriately
state
that
i
have
other
reasons
but
if
the
court
would
like
other
reasons
why
the
burglary
charge
was
infected
but
if
the
court
would
--
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
that's
correct
sir.
in
this
case,
the
state
of
maryland
to
conduct
the
prosecution
successfully
had
to
prove
that
benton
intended
to
steal
when
he
entered
the
premises.
in
the
first
trial
it
was
adjudicated
that
he
did
not
intent
to
steal.
we
contend
that
this
was
res
judicata
under
the
sealfon
case
that
this
principle
applies
in
criminal
cases
and
that
therefore
he
was
entitled
to
have
excluded
and
he
mentioned
in
any
evidence
of
a
larceny.
thus,
the
state
obtained
an
advantage
that
they
ordinarily
would
not
have
had
in
proving
intent.
secondly,
your
honor,
the
necessity
of
defending
two
rather
that
one
charge
has
technically
disadvantaged
the
petitioner.
another
reason
why
we
feel
that
the
burglary
charge
is
invalid
is
that
the
state
in
this
case
used
the
device
of
cumulating
as
many
charges
as
it
could
so
as
to
promote
a
compromise
atmosphere
in
the
jury
room
and
cause
the
jury
to
convict
him
of
at
least
one,
although
of
course
in
this
case
he
was
convicted
of
two.
we
also
submit
that
another
reason
why
he
was
prejudiced
and
why
the
burglary
conviction
should
be
reversed
is
that
the
jury
was
permitted
to
consider
prejudicially
irrelevant
testimony
because
again
benton
had
a
right
to
have
the
jury
not
consider
any
evidence
of
larceny
in
view
of
his
first
acquittal
and
the
doctrine
of
res
judicata.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
well,
i
submit
your
honor
that
they
could
endeavor
to
prove
the
intent
to
steal
by
other
means.
perhaps
a
conversation,
perhaps
burglary
tools,
none
of
which
where
present
in
this
case
but
this
is
one
of
our
points
your
honor.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
we
feel
that
they
--
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
we
feel
that
they
could
not
show
that
anything
was
missing
from
the
premises
after
benton
had
left
the
premises
because
that
is
the
issue
the
in
the
larceny
case
and
the
larceny
case
was
adjudicated
in
his
favor.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
yes.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
the
question
then
your
honor
comes
before
the
court
of
if
they
did
not
charge
larceny
could
they
have
shown
that
items
were
--
of
personal
property
were
missing
from
the
premises
just
on
the
burglary
charge
alone
and
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
answer
to
that
is
no.
whereas
they
might
have
been
able
under
ordinary
circumstance
to
show
that
an
asportation
had
taken
place,
they
couldn't
once
this
matter
was
adjudicated
in
his
favor.
oh,
we
also
submit
that
there
are
certain
cases
that
decided
by
this
court
that
hold
that
even
though
there
is
no
isolatable
prejudice,
if
prejudice
does
permeate
the
trial
then
the
entire
preceding
is
officiated
and
we
respectfully
submit
as
out
last
ground
that
is
another
reason
why
the
burglary
conviction
should
be
set
aside.
thank
you
your
honor
and
turning
now
to
the
issue
before
the
court
it
was
petitioners'
contention
if
the
court
please
that
the
hirabayashi
concurrent
sentence
doctrine
no
longer
has
validity
in
view
of
sibron
versus
new
york
which
case
involved
the
petitioner
whose
criminal
record
and
background
was
similar
to
the
petitioners
in
the
instant
case.
as
a
result
of
the
sibron
decision,
it
is
incumbent
upon
the
government
to
show
that
no
possibility
of
collateral
legal
consequences
will
be
imposed
on
the
basis
of
the
challenged
conviction.
i
believe
that
sibron
makes
it
clear
that
the
fact
that
a
petitioner
has
a
substantial
criminal
record
does
not
in
itself
mean
that
there
are
no
significant
collateral
legal
consequences.
it
is
submitted
that
the
rational
of
the
sibron
case
is
equally
persuasive
in
the
petitioner's
case
and
additional
fact
in
favor
of
abolishment
of
the
hirabayashi
rule
in
the
case
of
concurrent
sentences
is
the
consequences
that
may
occur
where
a
valid
conviction
is
set
aside
at
a
remote
time
for
such
reason
as
newly
discovered
evidence.
in
that
case,
the
defendant's
evidence
may
be
stale.
he
may
be
unable
to
locate
and
master
his
witnesses
and
thus
unable
to
vindicate
himself
and
therefore
we
submit
that
the
concurrent
sentence
case
it
is
even
the
sibron
rule
is
even
more
applicable.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
i'm
sorry
your
honor
but
i
do
not
however
i
do
note
that
the
recidivist
statutes
used
the
word
conviction
and
most
of
them
do
not
refer
to
multiple
convictions
but
just
leave
it
at
that.
although,
under
the
sibron
case
it
is
not
incumbent
upon
the
petitioner
to
establish
the
collateral
legal
consequences,
if
it
please
the
court,
i
might
venture
to
mention
one.
regrettably,
due
to
misinformation
the
petitioner's
brief
states
that
he
has
only
one
felony
conviction,
when
actually
it
appears
that
he
has
three
felony
convictions.
however,
the
petitioner's
background
does
have
some
redeeming
features.
following
two
of
his
felony
convictions,
petitioners
served
with
distinction
in
the
united
states
army.
he
was
a
decorated
soldier,
a
recipient
of
the
purple
heart
and
to
this
day
receives
a
veteran's
administration
service
connected
disability.
perhaps,
some
future
administrative
body
or
judge
will
consider
the
petitioner's
meritorious
military
record
but
will
find
that
the
invalid
larceny
conviction
militates
against
favorable
consideration.
in
this
case,
the
petitioner
does
not
seek
a
declaration
in
the
air.
he
has
a
substantial
interest
in
the
outcome
of
this
litigation.
there
is
nothing
abstract
thing
or
hypothetical
about
this
--
his
appeal.
it
is
submitted
that
another
reason
exists
for
not
applying
the
hirabayashi
doctrine
in
this
case.
the
state
of
maryland
does
not
follow
the
hirabayashi
rule
but
instead
allows
the
court
to
correct
and
set
aside
an
invalid
conviction
at
any
time
regardless
of
its
immediate
impact
upon
the
defendant.
following
this
rule,
the
maryland
court
of
appeals
has
on
many
occasions
reversed
invalid
convictions
when
the
sentences
were
ordered
to
be
served
concurrently
with
a
valid
conviction.
we
submit
that
application
of
a
state
remedy
to
a
case
involving
a
violation
of
a
federal
constitutional
provision
is
not
noble.
in
brady
versus
maryland,
this
court
held
that
the
state
of
maryland
violated
a
petitioner's
right
to
due
process
of
law
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
when
it
withheld
from
him
exculpatory
information.
at
the
same
time,
however,
this
court
held
that
they
use
to
which
this
exculpatory
information
would
be
put
was
to
be
determines
by
the
law
of
the
state
of
maryland
rather
than
the
federal
law.
the
solicitor
general
recognizes
that
the
government
under
the
doctrine
of
sibron
cannot
possibly
negate
the
existence
of
all
collateral
consequences.
and
the
solicitor
general
meets
the
problem
by
stating
that
the
rule
in
sibron
versus
new
york
requiring
the
government
to
show
that
no
possible
legal
collateral
consequences
exists
should
not
apply
in
the
case
of
concurrent
sentences.
however,
it
is
respectfully
submitted
to
the
court
that
the
solicitor
general
offers
no
cogent
reason
for
distinguishing
the
situation
where
sentences
have
been
served
from
the
situation
where
sentences
are
to
be
served
concurrently
as
in
the
instant
case.
the
maryland
attorney
general
approaches
the
problem
differently
by
stating
that
his
brief
raises
and
negates
the
existence
of
all
possible
collateral
consequences
that
might
confront
the
petitioner.
since
collateral
consequences
are
often
unpredictable,
we
submit
that
the
state
lacks
such
extraordinary
perception
in
this
case.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
yes,
sir.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
we
submit
to
your
honor
that
is
incumbent
upon
the
state,
that
the
state
has
the
burden
of
negating
the
existence
of
all
possible
collateral
legal
consequences.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
yes,
sir.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
yes,
your
honor.
in
conclusion
with
respect
--
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
yes
sir.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
your
honor,
i've
attempted
to
answer
one
when
i
state
and
refer,
alluded
to
(voice
overlap).
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
that
is
on
of
them,
your
honor.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
i'm
sorry,
sir?
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
it
might
be
but
it
certainly
will
(voice
overlap).
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
i
believe
that
the
parole
consequences
are
involved
in
this
case
--
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
under
the
maryland
law,
the
district
attorney
of
the
county
in
which
the
case
is
tried
has
--
must
certify
to
the
parole
department
an
abstract
of
each
case
in
which
a
conviction
was
rendered.
now,
i
submit
to
the
court
that
is
a
factor
which
governs
or
guides,
or
helps
to
guide
the
parole
authorities
in
determining
the
illegibility
for
parole.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
yes,
sir.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
i
believe
that
it's
possible,
your
honor.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
possibility
--
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
the
factor
that
i
mentioned
about
his
past
record.
his
conviction
says
two
felony
convictions
are
very
old,
one
when
he
was
39
and
one
in
40.
one
was
when
he
was
16
years
of
age
before
there
was
a
juvenile
delinquency
law.
i
believe
that
it's
difficult
to
anticipate
what
a
future
administrative
body
or
what
a
future
judge
will
think
of
his
record.
certainly
your
honor,
conviction
of
two
crimes
cannot
help
him
as
compared
to
one.
may
it
please
the
court
in
conclusion
for
the
reason
stated;
we
respectfully
request
the
court
to
order
reversal
of
the
larceny
conviction
and
order
a
new
trial
from
the
burglary
charge.
i
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
just
a
few
matters
if
you
please
for
rebuttal.
the
--
both
the
solicitor
general
of
the
united
states
and
maryland's
attorney
general
had
argued
that
the
abandonment
of
the
concurrent
sentence
doctrine
would
unnecessarily
burden
the
administration
of
justice.
however,
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
the
experience
of
the
maryland
courts
of
appeal
which
often
review
all
convictions
whether
sentences
were
concurrently
served
or
not
does
not
indicate
that
the
courts
workload
has
become
unbearable
because
of
its
review
of
invalid
as
well
as
valid
convictions.
if
there
is
no
doubt
your
honors
but
the
maryland's
higher
courts
of
appeals
and
highest
courts
review
convictions
in
which
the
terms
are
ordered
to
be
served
concurrently.
i
have
the
volumes
here.
i
can
quote
from
them
and
cite
the
cases,
many
of
them
all
the
ones
that
i've
reviewed
in
fact
deal
with
situations
where
two
sentences
were
imposed
as
a
result
of
one
criminal
transaction.
in
other
words
situations
eminently
analogous
to
the
situation
which
petitioner
is
presently
in.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
i
believe
the
double
jeopardy
argument
would
still
be
before
the
court
your
honor.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
both
the
court
--
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
well,
i
believe
that
double
jeopardy
argument
as
a
matter
of
justice
sir
must
be
dispose
of
in
this
case,
yes
sir.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
if
the
court
your
honor
held
that
the
larceny
conviction
was
invalid.
we
respectfully
submit
that
they
can
reach
it
regardless
of
the
fact
that
it
was
a
concurring
sentence
because
we
feel
that
the
doctrine
enunciated
in
the
suit
case
of
sibron
versus
new
york
should
be
applicable
to
this
case.
moreover,
we
contend
and
respectfully
request
that
this
court
void
both
convictions
because
of
the
prejudice
that
was
inherent
in
the
trial.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
yes,
sir.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
i
believe
it
has
no
effect,
your
honor.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
were
the
court
to
reject
the
petitioner's
appeal
in
this
case
according
to
the
order
of
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
maryland,
benton
will
serve
no
more
than
10
years
in
prison.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
that's
because
--
yes,
sir,
it's
because
of
the
former
jeopardy
point
that
reached
the
question
of
whether
double
jeopardy
attached
where
after
in
a
success
of
prosecution
the
defendant
received
an
increase
penalty.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
we
did
not
raise
the
point,
your
honor.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
yes.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
yes,
sir.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
not
at
all.
that
is
correct.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
no,
your
honor.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
the
limited
double
of
jeopardy
argument
of
increased
penalty
on
a
second
trial.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
yes
sir
and
that
was
based
on
the
case
of
patton
versus
north
carolina,
fourth
circuit
case
which
held
that
was
another
form
of
double
jeopardy.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
the
district
court
was
apprised
of
the
fact
that
i
had
this
case
pending
before
this
court.
the
--
excuse
me
--
the
--
in
--
mr.
burch
speaking
for
the
state
of
maryland
states
that
in
the
sibron
case,
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
new
york
stated
to
this
court
at
least
in
his
brief
stated
to
the
court
that
collateral
consequences
did
in
fact
exists
in
mr.
sibron's
case.
i
have
before
me,
your
honor
volume
number
25
of
the
transcript
of
records
and
file
copies
of
briefs
on
file
on
this
court.
and
i
note
that
from
the
state
of
new
york's
supplementary
--
respondent's
supplemental
brief
the
attorney
general
attempts
to
negate
probable
collateral
legal
consequences
rather
than
admit
that
they
exist.
and
of
course
this
court
did
not
accept
the
new
york
attorney
general's
argument
in
the
sibron
case.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
no,
but
they
do
have
appeal
where
the
judge
acquits
him.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
the
jury
your
honor.
the
--
i
would
like
to
respectfully
point
out
to
the
court
that
the
petitioner's
criminal
record
is
substantially
similar
to
the
criminal
record
which
mr.
nelson
sibron
had
in
the
case
of
sibron
versus
new
york.
and
that
there
are
no
cogent
reasons
for
distinguishing
this
petitioner
situation
from
the
situation
that
sibron
was
in.
on
behalf
of
the
petitioner,
i
respectfully
thank
the
court
for
the
great
consideration
they
have
given
to
this
case.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
excuse
me
mr.
chief
justice,
but
may
i
address
the
court
for
one
more
moment
on
--
mr.
m.
michael
cramer
i
thank
you
very
much.
i
would
like
to
make
clear
your
honors
the
question
of
what
happened
in
the
remand.
on
page
2
and
3
of
the
appendix
filed
with
this
court.
the
third
paragraph
shows
that
on
june
30,
1966,
the
defendant
challenged
the
array
of
the
grand
jurors.
in
other
words,
he
exercised
his
right
to
have
his
burglary
conviction
set
aside.
it
was
until
two
months
later
as
revealed
on
page
3
of
the
appendix
that
he
was
indicted
on
the
larceny
as
well
as
the
burglary
conviction.
so
it
cannot
be
said
on
the
basis
of
this
record
that
at
the
time
he
made
his
election
which
was
june
30,
1966
that
he
knew
of
the
dire
consequences
that
would
face
him
if
he
took
advantage
of
his
first
amendment
rights.
therefore
your
honor,
the
second
trial
for
the
larceny
as
well
as
the
burglary
was
unfair
from
the
very
beginning.
thank
you.
