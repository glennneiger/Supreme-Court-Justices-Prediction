justice

fortas
bur
every
suit
that's
dismissible
is
not
removable.
isn't
that
what
the
tenth
circuit
said?
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
beg
your
pardon.
suppose
a
prison
guard
beats
a
prisoner
and
that
is
--
suit
is
brought
and
it
is
so
alleged.
do
you
think
that
that's
under
color
of
office
too
in
threads
and
the
removal?
justice
abe
fortas
why?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that
goes
to
question
of
burden.
maybe
the
burden
--
that's
a
question
of
burden
and
a
question
of
proof,
but
why
should
there
be
a
different
rule
as
to
removal
in
the
case
of
a
prison
guard
and
in
the
case
of
--
a
case
of
a
person
in
the
warden
or
the
chief
physician?
i
don't
understand
it.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
gave
you
a
very
simple
case
and
i
thought
your
answer
was
going
to
be
that
that
would
be
removable.
a
prison
guard
is
charged
with
complaints
filed
against
prison
guard
for
beating
up
a
prisoner
to
his
injury.
now
--
and
then
--
is
that
removable
or
is
it
not
under
the
statute
--
justice
abe
fortas
in
your
submission?
justice
abe
fortas
but
either
you're
--
you're
getting
back
to
the
tenth
circuit
position
and
supporting
it.
the
complaint
is
filed
and
the
complaint
merely
alleges
that
the
prison
guard
beat
up
this
prisoner
and
injured
him
and
he
suffered
damages
which
he's
now
claiming,
and
petition
for
removal
is
filed
and
the
prison
guard
says
“i
didn't
do
it.”
justice
abe
fortas
if
you
say
that
it's
got
to
be
a
--
justice
abe
fortas
a
trial
of
fact
before
then.
that's
exactly
what
the
tenth
circuit
has
said
here
in
which
you're
complaining
of
to
the
court.
justice
abe
fortas
i
mean
i
am
saying
that
he
denies
--
he
files
a
denial
that
he
did
it.
justice
abe
fortas
you
think
that's
enough?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
are
you
making
any
distinction
between
prison
guard
because
he
is
a
guard,
on
the
one
hand,
and
the
warden
because
he
is
a
warden,
on
the
other
hand?
justice
abe
fortas
under
these
cases,
you
get
exactly
the
same
thing.the
prisoner
said
he
did
it
and
the
guard
or
the
warden
says
he
--
“i
didn't
do
it.”
now,
if
you
want
to
go
beyond
that,
it
seems
to
me
that
you're
agreeing
with
the
tenth
circuit.
justice
abe
fortas
what
i
really
started
out
to
ask
you
is
this,
mr.
beytagh.
suppose
we
should
disagree
with
the
tenth
circuit.
do
you
think
that
we
should
then
confront
the
issue
of
whether
there
is
immunity
in
this
case?
justice
abe
fortas
do
you
think
that
maybe
what
we
ought
to
do
is
to
decide
only
the
question
of
removal
and
then
remand
to
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
abe
fortas
i
wonder
if
the
matter
of
burden
of
going
forward
may
be
relevant
here.
now,
let
us
assume
that
it
was
alleged
somewhere
that
these
injuries,
the
alleged
tort,
took
place
in
the
prison.
i
have
a
little
difficulty
finding
that,
except
in
the
interrogatories
which
were
not
answered.
but,
let's
assume
that
the
--
it
was
alleged
that
the
injury
took
place
in
the
prison.
let
us
assume
that
it
is
alleged
or
stipulated
that
the
defendants
were
--
are
and
were
officers
of
the
prison,
and
then
i
wonder
if
it
--
a
petition
for
removal
is
filed.
i
wonder
if
that
does
not
then
shift
the
burden
of
going
forward
to
the
plaintiff-prisoner,
and
if
that
is
so,
what
did
the
prisoner
do
to
go
forward
with
the
verified
allegations
here
to
tending
to
demonstrate
that
the
action
of
the
warden
and
the
chief
physician
was
outside
of
the
scope
of
their
official
of
their
office?
justice
abe
fortas
what
did
he
do
with
respect
to
the
burden
of
going
forward?
is
there
anything
in
this
record?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i'm
--
i
might
--
let
us
assume
for
the
moment
that
we
should
conclude
that
where
it
is
alleged
that
injuries
took
place
within
the
prison
and
that
the
--
where
it
is
shown
that
the
defendants
are
officials
of
the
prison.
just
assume
with
me
for
the
moment
that
we
would
conclude
that
that
sets
up
a
prima
facie
case
for
removal,
and
let
us
assume
further
that,
then,
the
burden
of
going
forward
beyond
that
point,
you
say,
is
on
the
plaintiff-prisoner
to
make
some
further
allegations
that
would
tend
to
show,
for
example,
that
the
warden
and
the
physician
acted
outside
the
scope
of
their
office
in
doing
the
acts
complained
of
here.
i'm
--
what
i'm
asking
is,
is
there
anything
in
the
record
here
setting
forth
allegations
--
verified
allegations
by
the
prisoner
tending
to
show
that
the
physician
and
the
warden
proceeded
outside
the
scope
of
their
official
duties?
justice
abe
fortas
don't
you
think
that's
what
he
tried
to
do
in
paragraph
8
of
the
petition
for
removal
on
page
9
of
the
appendix
where
he
says,
before
that,
he's
alleged
that
he
was
the
warden,
etcetera
and
now
--
and
then
at
paragraph
8
he
says
that
anything
that
was
done
or
may
have
been
done
was
done
under
color
of
office
and
as
an
employee
and
etcetera,
and
that
the
acts
complaint
of
was
made
solely
under
color
of
office
and
within
the
scope
of
their
authority.
justice
abe
fortas
there
is
a
general
allegation
and
then
the
question
is
whether
in
fact
the
burden
of
going,
seems
to
me,
that
maybe
the
question
is
that
the
--
whether
the
burden
of
going
forward
with
particularized
allegations,
more
--
much
more
particularized
than
in
the
complaint
of
which,
as
you
said
earlier,
is
pretty
general
too.
whether
that
burden
then
shifted
to
the
plaintiff,
perhaps?
i'm
not
saying
that
i'm
sure
that
that's
correct
analysis,
but
that's
one
possible
approach.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
what
you're
really
saying
is
raising
as
a
question
as
to
whether
paragraph
8
is
sufficiently
particularized
to
shift
the
burden
of
going
forward,
and
i
suppose
that
then
the
question
would
naturally
arise
as
to
whether
you
can
expect
more
than
that
at
this
stage
of
the
case
and
whether
that's
adequate
as
a
matter
of
law.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
it
isn't
quite
that.
as
easy
as
that,
is
it
mr.
beytagh
because
it
could
--
the
petition
--
the
complaint
contains
a
lot
of
very
specific
allegations
and
i
suppose
that
they
could've
said
that
he
was
never
inoculated
or,
if
he
was
inoculated,
the
prison
record
show
that
such
and
such
were
the
facts
and
that
he
was
never
given
any
unusually
onerous
tasks
to
conform.
the
prison
records
show
so-and-so.
so,
there
could've
been
specificity.
the
question,
it
seems
to
me,
may
be
who
has
the
burden
of
going
forward
for
purposes
of
this
removal
--
justice
abe
fortas
order.
justice
abe
fortas
bur
every
suit
that's
dismissible
is
not
removable.
isn't
that
what
the
tenth

said?
justice

fortas
suppose

justice

i
beg
your
pardon.
suppose
a
prison

that
is

is
brought

do
you

be
a

in
the
case
