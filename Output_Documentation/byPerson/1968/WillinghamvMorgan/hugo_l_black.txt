when
was
the
statute
passed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
brought
about
the
passage
of
the
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
answer
of
the
circ
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
do
you
say
would
have
to
be
alleged
in
order
to
show
what
under
color
was?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
then
what
--
you
could
tell
us
what
could
be
alleged.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
they
show
where
it
happened?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
didn't
get
any
complaint
about
why
--
where
it
happened?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
plaintiff's
case
--
anything
in
the
plaintiff's
complaint?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
does
he
say
it
happened?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
they
say
what
he
did?
what
did
he
do?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
mean,
do
you
cite
in
the
complaint
charge
what
the
defendant
does.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
do
you
say
he
does?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
what's
his
occupation?
justice
hugo
l.
black
warden?
justice
hugo
l.
black
of
the
prisoner?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
would
that
be
necessary
and
the
statute
intended
if
the
man
is
in
a
prison
and
the
warden
is
therein
guarding
prisoners,
isn't
it
enough
to
say
that
he
is
the
warden
in
order
to
get
removal?
why
would
you
have
to
go
in
front
of
us?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that
means
he's
a
federal
officer
inside
the
prison
and
that
this
man
was
a
prisoner.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
what
are
his
charges?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
he
charges
the
warden
of
having
done.
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
the
prison.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
wouldn't
that
be
a
care
within
an
inference
unanswered,
because
what
he
did
was
to
knock
him
down
while
he
is
tending
to
his
duties
as
a
guard?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
this
court
act
on
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
did
either
one
object
to
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
the
parties
chose
to
submit
it
to
the
court
on
the
allegations
of
the
pleadings
up
to
that
time?
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
why
shouldn't
--
why
do
we
need
to
go
any
further?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
that
change
it?
can
litigants
act
with
reference
to
jurisdiction
of
the
court
by
the
parties
who
wanted
to
try
it
with
that
sworn
evidence?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
it
can't
waive
the
jurisdiction
requirement,
but
what
evidence
--
what
are
they
going
to
pass
on
if
not
on
the
allegations
in
the
pleadings?
that's
usually
the
way
you
determine
jurisdiction,
allegations
in
the
pleadings.
justice
hugo
l.
black
for
failing
to
allege
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
really
the
sole
issue?
justice
hugo
l.
black
one
of
these
defendants
was
a
petitioner.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
they
show
--
the
record
show
that
he
had
been
assigned
there
to
do
the
services
as
a
physician,
does
it
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that
the
complaint
is
based
on
the
charge
that
this
position
for
the
team
with
the
aid
of
the
other
man
conniving
with
him
to
take
some
kind
of
shot
in
his
arm
or
leg
or
something,
and
he
did
in
great
arm.
and
now,
what's
--
why
doesn't
that
show
about
as
well
as
you
could
show
it?
in
fact,
the
man
wanted
to
know
whether
they
were
both
in
the
performance
of
their
duties.
that's
the
position
that
he
wanted
and
hasn't
managed
it.
do
they
have
to
go
out
and
prove
the
beyond
the
shadow
of
a
doubt?
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
everybody
agrees
to
it.
that's
what
was
alleged.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
he
doesn't
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
doesn't
allege
it
was
an
extraordinary
one.
he
just
alleges
that
they
didn't
have
to.
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
was
given
this
serum
and
he
thought
it
might
kill
him.
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
doesn't
say
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
part?
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
gather,
what
he
alleges
is
the
treatment
of
the
serum,
this
doctor,
the
other
man
was
helping,
he
gave
it
to
him,
and
he
then
fell
to
the
floor.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
a
possibility,
of
course.
but,
with
these
filed
pleadings
both
sides
gone
and
submit
it
to
the
court
on
petition
for
removal
on
the
pleadings
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
see
why
you
have
to
go
any
further
than
the
pleadings.
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
look
at
the
whole
record.
does
that
say
you
don't
look
at
the
whole
record
where
the
parties
submitted
on
the
pleadings
and
that's
all
they
submitted
on?
does
that
case
stem
from
the
principle
that
the
judge
is
barred
from
taking
the
importance
of
the
words
in
the
pleadings
to
what's
happened
and
then
he
has
to,
somehow,
force
them
to
come
in
and
swear
in
addition
to
the
pleadings?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
right
but
if
it
does
allege
it,
why
not
enough
if
it's
not
denied?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
why
would
the
jurisdiction
make
up
such
a
noise?
that's
a
strong
word.
it
means
many
things
at
many
places.
but,
the
mere
fact
that
you
are
testing
a
jurisdiction,
i
thought
you
always
tested
it
mainly
by
the
pleadings,
what
it
alleges,
not
what
can
be
proven.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
know
of
any
state
in
the
union
that
is
not
sufficient
to
file
a
complaint
without
swearing
to
it
and
you
just
whether
or
not
the
court
has
jurisdiction
by
what's
alleged?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
are
you
relying
on
the
allegations
of
the
papers
as
being
the
facts
so
far
as
this
trial
is
concerned
or
do
you
think
he's
right
in
indicating,
as
i
gather,
there's
an
indication
that
you
had
to
have
some
form
too?
justice
