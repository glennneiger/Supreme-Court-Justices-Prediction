but
once
you've
proved
that
the

did
this
outside
the

his
authority,
you
recover
against
the

everybody
else.
what's
left
in
the
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
you
have
--
you
first
have
to
prove
that
the
incident
did
occur.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how
did
you
find
out
when
he
was
acting
under
color
of
authority
and
when
he
was
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
only
way,
i
submit,
you
could
do
it
is,
when
he
was
beating
the
man
up,
he
was
outside
the
color
of
authority.
justice
thurgood
marshall
once
you
proved
that,
you've
proved
your
case.
justice
thurgood
marshall
all
he
has
to
show
is
he
beat
him
up.
he
doesn't
have
to
show
the
homicide.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
wouldn't
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
there's
some
substance
to
the
fact
that
leavenworth
is
a
maximum
security
prison
and
the
respondent
was
in
that
prison.
so,
whatever
the
warden
is
charged
with
doing
was
done
in
the
prison,
unless
he
escaped.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
then,
wouldn't
normal
reaction
be
that
it
was
under
color
of
his
office?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
submit
that
the
fact
that
he
says
“the
only
time
i
came
in
contact
with
this
man
was
inside
the
prison
when
i
was
the
warden.”
that
does
not
give
you
any
idea
that
that
might
be
under
color
with
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
else
would
he
have
to
say
other
than
under
color
of
authority?
what
else
could
he
say,
the
warden,
“i
beat
the
man
up”?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
could
he
say?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
suppose
he
said
just
that,
would
that
be
enough?
justice
thurgood

what
other
facts?
justice
thurgood

wouldn't
