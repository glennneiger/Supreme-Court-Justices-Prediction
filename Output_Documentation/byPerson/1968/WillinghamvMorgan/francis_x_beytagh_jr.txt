mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
certain
respects,
this
case
involves
a
rather
narrow
and
somewhat
technical
issue
of
federal
procedure
but
underlying
it
are
some
important
questions
that
relate
to
notions
of
federal
supremacy
involving
issues
of
importance
to
prison
officials
and
to
federal
governmental
officials
generally.
the
issue
in
a
nutshell
is
this,
a
federal
statute.
section
1442
(a)
(1)
of
title
28
of
the
united
states
code
provides
that
suits
against
federal
officers
may
be
removed
when
brought
in
a
state
court
to
a
federal
court
where
the
acts
that
are
alleged
to
have
occurred
about
the
basis
of
the
suit
occur
when
the
officer
is
acting
under
“color”
of
his
office.
we've
set
the
statute
out
at
page
2
of
our
brief.
it
provides
important
part
as
follows.
a
civil
action
or
a
criminal
prosecution
commenced
in
a
state
court
against
any
of
the
following
persons
may
be
removed
by
them
to
the
district
court
of
the
united
states
for
the
district
and
division
embracing
the
place
wherein
it
is
pending,
one,
any
officer
of
the
united
states
or
any
agency
thereof
or
person
acting
under
him
for
any
act
under
color
of
such
office.
the
issue
arises
here
on
the
following
facts.
respondent
daniel
morgan
was
a
prisoner
at
the
federal
penitentiary
at
leavenworth,
kansas.
he
had
been
transferred
there
in
march
1966
and
in
july
1966,
some-four
months
later,
filed
the
damage
action
which
is
the
subject
of
this
suit
in
a
kansas
state
court.
petitioners
willingham
and
jarvis
are
the
warden
--
and
were
then,
warden
and
chief
officer
of
the
federal
penitentiary
at
leavenworth.
they
were
the
only
named
defendants
in
respondent
morgan's
suit.
there
were
75
unnamed
co-defendants.
he
sought
a
total
recovery
of
an
excessive
$90
million
in
damages.
he
alleged
in
some-10
counts
a
variety
of
tortuous
acts
that
he
said
had
been
perpetrated
upon
him
by
petitioners
willingham
and
jarvis
and
the
other
75
people.
in
substance,
his
complaints
can
be
boiled
down
to
really
two
issues.
he
asserted
that
he
had
been
inoculated
with
some
dangerous
foreign
substance
which
had
caused
him
to
fall
and
injure
himself
and
that,
in
the
course
of
this
inoculation,
unauthorized
people
had
been
giving
him
medical
assistance.
and,
in
another
count,
he
asserted
in
conclusory
fashion
that
he
had
been
beaten
and
assaulted
and
tortured
in
various
respects.
petitioners
willingham
and
jarvis
filed
a
general
denial
in
the
state
court
denying
all
the
allegations
in
the
10-count
complaint
that
had
been
filed
by
respondent.
they
also
filed,
pursuant
to
section
1442
(a)
(1),
a
verified
petition
for
removal
of
this
action
from
the
kansas
state
court
to
the
federal
district
court
for
the
district
of
kansas.
in
this
removal
petition,
they
asserted
that,
at
all
relevant
times,
they
had
been
acting
in
their
official
capacities
as
warden
and
chief
medical
officer
of
leavenworth
penitentiary
and
they
set
out
the
various
counts
of
the
complaint
and
then,
at
page
9
of
the
record,
they
said
that
morgan
is,
and
was
at
all
times
mentioned,
a
dully
committed
prisoner
inmate
of
the
federal
penitentiary
at
leavenworth
and
rather
that
any
act
or
thing
that
these
petitioners,
or
either
of
them,
may
have
done
or
authorized
to
be
done
concerning
morgan,
complained
of
by
him,
was
done
and
made
by
them
in
the
course
of
their
duties
as
officers
of
the
united
states
of
america
and
as
persons
acting
under
officers
of
the
united
states
of
america
and
under
color
of
such
office
and
by
virtue
thereof.
and,
they
again
refer
to
their
officers
as
the
warden
and
chief
medical
officer.
morgan
then
filed
a
motion
in
the
federal
district
court
to
remand
the
case
back
to
the
state
court.
he
asserted
for
a
variety
of
respects
that
petitioners
were
not
acting
under
color
of
office
when
they
committed
the
acts
he
alleged
they
had
committed.
he
also
filed
a
rather
extensive
set
of
interrogatories
on
petitioner
willingham,
directed
in
substantial
part
obtaining
the
names
of
the
unnamed
unidentified
co-defendants.
with
the
district
court's
approval,
an
enlargement
of
time
to
answer
these
interrogatories
was
obtained.
the
next
step
was
petitioners
filing
for
a
summary
judgment
in
the
federal
district
court
on
the
ground
that
morgan's
suit
should
be
dismissed
under
the
so-called
official
immunity
doctrine
which
has
been
established
by
this
court
as
relating
to
executive
officials
as
well
as
judicial
and
legislative
officials
in
cases
dating
back
to
spalding
versus
vilas
and
going
through
barr
versus
matteo.
petitioners,
at
that
point,
filed
failry
extensive
affidavits
which
are
set
out
at
pages
44
and
--
through
48
of
the
defendant
appendix.
those
affidavits
detail
their
duties
as
warden
and
chief
medical
officer
at
leavenworth
and
stated
that
the
only
contact
that
they
had
had
with
respondent
morgan
was
within
the
prison
walls
at
leavenworth
and
was
in
the
course
of
their
official
duties
as
warden
and
chief
medical
officer.
respondent
morgan
opposed
dismissal
on
a
variety
of
grounds.
the
district
court
in
august
of
1966
denied
the
motion
of
respondent
morgan
to
remand
the
suit
to
the
state
court,
finding
that
removal
was
proper
under
section
1442
(a)
(1)
and
writing
a
short
opinion
in
that
regard.
subsequently,
in
december
of
1966,
the
district
court
granted
petitioner's
motion
for
summary
judgment
and
dismissed
the
suit.
in
substance,
the
basis
for
the
dismissal
was
the
district
court's
determination
that
the
suit
was
covered
by
the
official
immunity
doctrine
and
that
not
only
had
it
been
properly
removed,
but
that
it
was
subject
to
dismissal.
respondent
morgan
then
appealed
to
the
tenth
circuit
from
this
judgment,
and
both
parties
frankly
thought
that
the
issue
before
the
tenth
circuit
related
to
whether
the
district
court
had
properly
determined
that
the
requisite
--
prerequisites
for
the
official
immunity
doctrine
had
been
met
and
the
case
was
briefed
and
submitted
on
the
brief
to
the
court
on
that
basis.
however,
in
deciding
the
case,
the
tenth
circuit
found
it
unnecessary
to
reach
the
question
of
whether
the
official
immunity
defense
was
properly
invoked
here.
instead,
it,
although
it
started
out
by
saying
and
spent
most
of
its
opinion
by
discussing
the
nature
of
interrelationship
between
the
official
immunity
standard
and
the
so-called
color
of
office
test
for
removal,
it
concluded
that
the
district
court
had
erred
in
finding
that
the
suit
had
been
properly
removed.
it
said
that
“the
color
of
office
test
for
removal
was
much
narrower,”
and
that's
a
quote
from
the
court
of
appeals
opinion,
than
the
standard
of
official
immunity
and,
therefore,
it
determined
that
the
district
court
did
not
have
an
adequate
basis
on
which
--
on
the
record
that
existed,
on
which
to
determine
that
removal
was
proper
and
it
reversed
the
district
court's
decision
not
reaching
the
official
immunity
question
and
remanded
for
a
factual
determination,
in
its
words,
of
the
question
whether
removal
was
proper.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
as
i
understand
it,
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
the
district
court
needed
a
more
adequate
factual
basis
for
making
a
determination
as
to
removal
and
that
is
the
issue
that
the
court
--
the
district
court
has
directed
to
address
itself
to
on
remand.
the
court
of
appeals
did
mention,
in
passing,
that
the
--
quite
curiously,
that
it
thought
that
perhaps
the
standard
for
dismissal
on
the
basis
of
official
immunity
might
have
been
made
out
here
but,
nonetheless,
it
didn't
feel
that
the
standard
of
color
of
office
for
removal
had
been
satisfied.
we
brought
the
case
here
on
petition
for
certiorari,
which
the
court
granted,
for
several
reasons.
the
case
has
great
potential
for
substantial
mischief
if
left
standing.
there
is,
as
respondent
concedes,
an
obvious
relationship
between
the
official
immunity
doctrine
and
the
color
of
office
test
for
removal
when
suits
are
brought
against
federal
officers
in
state
courts,
as
often
they
are.
and,
peculiarly,
prison
official
such
as
are
involved
in
this
case
can
be
subjected
to
harassment
by
bringing
and
having
to
defend
against
these
kind
of
suits
if
the
standard
that
the
court
of
appeals
has
now
erected
is
left
standing.
so,
we
agree
with
the
tenth
circuit
in
only
one
respect,
and
that
is
that
the
question
that
must
be
considered
is
the
interrelationship
of
the
official
immunity
doctrine
and
the
color
of
office
test
under
the
removal
statute.
we
think,
however,
that
the
court
of
appeals
is
manifestly
wrong
in
concluding
that
the
color
of
office
test
is
narrower
than
the
official
immunity
defense.
we
think
that
simply
stands
the
law
in
its
head
because
the
result
of
that
is
that
any
suit
proper
for
removal
would
automatically
be
dismissible
and
congress,
therefore,
would've
done
a
rather
empty
act
in
proving
a
federal
forum
to
do
nothing
but
dismiss
suits.
in
effect,
petition
for
removal
would
be
an
action
to
enjoin
the
suit.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that's
the
way
we
understand
the
tenth
circuit.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
as
i
understand
the
tenth
circuit's
opinion,
yes,
sir,
assuming
that
the
state
courts
would
apply
the
defense.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that's
correct.
yes,
sir.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
what
i
think
is
--
i
think
a
number
of
things
are
wr
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
the
mischief
is,
apparently,
the
tenth
circuit
would
require
that
an
extensive
factual
inquiry
be
made
to
determine
the
threshold
issue
of
removal,
and
if
that's
so,
then
many
of
the
purposes
which
the
official
immunity
doctrine
is
supposed
to
serve
would
be
disserved
by
this
notion
because
you
would
put
these
officers
to
the
kind
of
burdens
that
barr
versus
matteo
and
related
doctrines
is
supposed
to
protect
them
against.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
i
think
congress
has
made
the
judgment
that
these
suits
in
the
main
should
be
determined
in
federal
courts.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
because
of
the
removal
provision,
yes.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i'm
not
sure
whether
they
would
or
not.
i
think
that
congress
has
made
the
judgment,
as
i
said,
that
these
suits
should
be
--
the
federal
officers
have
a
right
to
have
these
suits
determined
in
a
federal
court.
now,
we're
not
taking
the
position
that
every
suit
that
is
removed
should
be
dismissed.
indeed,
a
number
of
suits
that
in
other
circuits,
where
i
think
they
properly
construed
the
removal
statute,
they
found
removal
proper
but
have
determined
that
the
suit
is
not
dismissible
under
barr
versus
matteo
and
the
case
goes
on
to
trial.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
there
was
one
district
court
case
in
that
respect.
the
other
cases
that
it
relied
on
were
all
motor
vehicle
negligence
cases.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
the
negligence
cases
present
a
difficult
problem.
it's
no
longer
a
viable
one
because
congress
has
taken
care
of
that
by
statute
by
providing
that
where
motor
vehicle
negligence
suits
involve
actions
done
within
the
scope
of
an
employee's
performance
stay
becomes
suits
against
the
united
states
under
section
2679,
i
believe,
as
amended.
but,
our
position,
basically,
is
those
suits
are
wrong.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
but,
the
--
i
should
note
the
tenth
circuit
completely
ignored
a
whole
host
of
court
of
appeals
authority.
it
cited
district
court
decision,
but
at
least
three
courts
of
appeals
that
have
squarely
faced
this
issue,
the
second
circuit,
the
fourth
circuit,
and
the
fifth
circuit,
and
it
concluded
exactly
the
opposite.
any
comparison
of
the
reach
of
these
two
concepts
is
--
they
have
reached
the
opposite
conclusion.
i
should
note
that
the
--
what
you
asked
about
the
mischief
that
may
come
from
this
is
another
problem
and
it
involves
the
fact
that
this
doctrine
won't
relate
simply
to
prison
officials
but
would
relate
to
federal
officials
generally.
some
federal
officials
do
some
things
in
some
places
in
this
country
that
are
not
popular.
indeed,
the
whole
notion
of
removal
stemmed
from
that.
the
first
statute
was
in
1815
and
it
had
to
do
with
the
opposition
by
some
new
england
states
to
the
war
of
1812.
it
was
limited
to
customs
officials
but
it
provided
a
way
for
customs
officers
of
the
united
states
to
remove
suits
brought
against
them
when
they
were
enforcing
the
customs
laws
to
a
federal
court
instead
of
being
sued
in
a
state
court.
it
goes
on
through
the
nullification
controversy
of
1883
--
of
1833
where
it
was
extended
to
revenue
officers,
such
has
been
successively
expanded
to
include
officers
of
both
houses
of
congress
and
officers
of
the
courts,
and
then
was
expanded
in
1948
to
include
all
federal
officers.
now,
two
cases
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
excuse
me,
sir.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
that
there
may
be
a
difference
between
a
prison
guard
and
a
senior
prison
official
such
as
the
individuals
involved
here.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
because
i
think
that
the
problem
in
making
the
factual
determination
that
the
--
apparently
the
tenth
circuit
would
require
here
is
substantially
more
difficult,
as
we've
tried
to
delineate
in
a
short
reply
brief
we
filed,
for
senior
officials
such
as
these
people.
they
--
there
are
over
2,000
prisoners
at
leavenworth
and,
for
them
to
recall
what
they
were
doing
on
a
particular
day
and
whether
they
had
anything
to
do
with
those
man
at
all
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
a
prison
guard,
it
seems
to
me,
there
may
be
circumstances
under
which
suits
brought
against
him
are
not
removable.
he
obviously
has
some
authority
to
exercise
discipline
over
prisoners
but,
obviously,
he
can
go
beyond
that
and
abuse
it.
now,
this
court
has
construed
in
cases
like
classic
and
monroe
versus
pape
and
screws
versus
united
states,
analogous
provision
that
relates
to
actions
under
color
of
law
by
state
officers.
and,
the
approach
taken
there
has
been
that
even
misuse
of
power
even
if
clothes
--
clothed
with
authority
provides
the
statutory
requisite
of
color
or
law.
i
think
there
may
be
circumstances
in
which
prison
guards
go
so
beyond
the
scope
of
their
proper
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
would
have
to
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
would
have
to
know
more
about
it.
i
would
have
to
know
whether
the
guard
was
able
to
file
a
verified
swear
to
a
removal
petition.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
if
he's
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no,
that's
not
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
you
added
the
point
that
he
is
able
to
verify
that
he
didn't
do
it.
if
he
can
do
that,
i
agree
that
it
is
removable.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
if
he
can
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
if
he
can
swear
to
an
affidavit
that
he
did
not
do
these
things
alleged,
then
the
suit
is
removable.
if,
however,
in
some
cases
that
this
court
has
considered,
such
as
soper
and
symes,
involves
situations
where
the
--
in
your
hypothetical,
the
guard
obviously
had
something
to
do
with
the
individual.
there
was
some
altercation.
there
was
some
action.
he
was
there
and
something
happened,
and
so
that
presents
him
a
more
difficult
case.
he
can't
simply
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think,
in
terms
of
the
--
of
how
elaborated
a
statement
is
required
in
order
to
justify
removal,
there
may
be
some
difference
regarding
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no,
i
don't
agree
with
the
tenth
circuit.
all
that
i
suggest
is
that
there
might
be
some
difference
if
the
individual
is
not
able
to
respond
by
filing
a
verified
removal
petition
that
he
simply
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
we've
not
urged
the
court
to
do
that.
the
tenth
circuit
didn't
reach
it.
of
course,
the
district
court
did.
if
the
court
feels
that
on
the
basis
of
the
record
that
it's
available
to
the
court,
that
it
can
uphold
the
district
court's
determination
in
that
regard,
of
course
the
government
would
feel
that
that
was
fine.
on
the
other
hand,
we're
not
urging
that
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
quite
properly,
your
honor,
that's
the
only
question
of
the
court
of
appeals
reached
and
it's
a
little
bit
difficult
for
us
to
urge
that
the
court
go
beyond
that
but,
as
i
said,
we
would
not
be
upset
by
that
approach
either.
i
was
going
to
mention,
in
response
to
justice
white's
question,
that
there
is
some
real
potential
for
mischief
here
in
the
tenth
circuit's
narrow
reading
of
the
removal
statute,
and
two
cases
i
think
show
why
this
is
so.
one
case
is
called
perez
versus
bridal
hoover.
it
was
brought
by
leander
perez
down
in
louisiana
against
federal
voting
examiners
in
a
state
court,
seeking
to
prevent
them
from
carrying
out
the
functions
that
congress
had
charged
them
with
carrying
out.
now,
they
sought
to
remove
that
case.
the
question
there
was
whether
they
were
acting
under
color
of
office.
now,
if
federal
officials
seeking
to
enforce
laws
like
this
are
required
to
come
forward
with
a
substantial
showing
that
they
were
acting
within
the
scope
of
their
official
duties
and
the
delay
and
the
harassment
in
predictiveness
that
comes
from
that
is
permissible,
then
i
think
that
there
is
a
real
mischief.
another
case
that
the
court
is
familiar
with
is
norton
versus
mcshane
which
came
out
of
the
meredith
incident
at
the
university
of
mississippi
where
suit
was
brought
by
individuals
down
in
mississippi
against
marshall,
mcshane,
and
others.
there,
removal
was
sought
in
the
state
court
and
was
granted,
but
if
you
read
the
statute
narrowly
and
you
can't
obtain
removal
without
a
thorough-going
extensive
factual
inquiry,
then
there
is
a
real
potential
for
mischief
and
hazard.
we
think
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
itself
supports
our
reading.
it
says
color
of
office.
it
doesn't
say
within
his
official
duties.
it
says
under
color
of
office.
as
i
mentioned,
the
courts
construed
other
similar
provisions
in
a
broad
fashion.
also,
it
seems
to
us
that,
while
respondent
here
has
more
or
less
conceded
that
the
tenth
circuit's
result
is
indefensible,
he's
possession
is
not
satisfactory
either.
in
short,
he
says
that,
while
the
tenth
circuit
may
have
erred
in
determining
the
comparative
reach
of
the
two
statutes,
it
did
not
err
in
determining
that
the
record
here
was
inadequate
for
the
district
court
to
determine
the
question
of
removal.
we
think,
on
the
facts
presented
and
for
the
reasons
developed
in
some
length
in
our
brief
and
in
our
reply
brief,
that
this
simply
is
not
so
and
that
if
you
say
at
least
as
to
officials
like
these
that
they
must
do
more
than
they've
done
here.
deny
the
charges,
assert
that
all
the
actions
occurred
within
the
prison
walls,
and
assert
that
anything
that
was
done
occurred
within
color
of
their
office
that,
inevitably,
you're
going
to
have
the
extensive
kind
of
litigation
on
this
threshold
issue
that's
gone
into
fee
most
of
the
purposes
of
the
official
immunity
doctrine
and,
i
think,
also
subvert
congress'
intent
in
enacting
the
statute.
i'd
like
to
save
the
time
i
have
left.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
this
particular
statute
dates
back
to
--
well,
1815
was
the
first
time
a
removal
statute
was
passed.
that
related
to
customs
officers
and
it
has
been
expanded
since
that
time.
in
1948,
it
was
expanded
to
include
all
federal
officers.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
the
passage
of
the
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
the
passage
of
the
first
law,
as
i
understand,
had
to
do
with
the
opposition
of
some
new
england
states
with
the
war
of
1812
and
they
didn't
want
federal
officers
collecting
customs
duties
up
there.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
just
several
points,
i
think
mr.
justice
marshall
put
his
finger
on
the
real
problem
here.
let's
assume
that
none
of
these
acts
occurred.
this
is
the
basic
position
of
petitioners.
they
didn't
do
anything
to
harm
this
man.
what
else
can
they
do?
they
denied
it.
they
said
that
any
contact
they
had
with
him
was
within
the
prison
walls
and
they
said
they
were
acting
within
their
official
duties,
and
they
said
that
they
were
the
warden
and
the
chief
medical
officer.
now,
respondent
keep
saying
“well,
we
need
more
facts.”
well,
i
submit
that
if
there
are
no
more
facts
to
refer
to,
i
don't
know
short
of
what
mr.
justice
marshall
suggested
that
they
must
admit
that
they
did
something
wrong,
they
can
do.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
i
agree
with
you
on
that.
i
don't
see
how
you
could
take
any
other
position.
it
seems
to
me,
the
district
court
had
before
it
controverted
allegations.
it
had
factual
circumstances
and
it
had
to
seek
to
apply
the
statute
against
that.
and,
it
seems
to
me
that,
in
the
circumstances,
there
wasn't
anything
else
that
he
can
do.
the
reliance
on
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
that's
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that
that's
correct,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
any
of
that
would've
been
subject
to
the
same
claim
that
it
was
conlusi
--
conclusionary
in
nature
and,
therefore,
inadequate
and
it
seems
to
us
that
the
district
court
had
an
adequate
basis
here
and
that
section
1446
on
which
respondent
now
relies
is
mentioned
by
the
court
of
appeals
only
in
one
sense.
it
said
that
all
the
requirements
thereof
were
met.
so,
in
conclusion,
we
submit
that
the
sope
and
symes
cases,
as
justice
stewart
pointed
out,
were
criminal
cases.
and,
there,
at
least
everybody
agreed
something
had
occurred
and,
therefore,
we
don't
think
they
are
controlling
here
and,
in
our
view,
the
court
of
appeals
is
wrong
and
we
submit
its
judgment
should
be
reversed.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
course
of
employment
is
a
somewhat
different
notion.
i
think
that
the
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
it
may
not
be
enough,
your
honor.
but,
again,
you
have
notions
of
--
you
have
the
notion
of
color
of
office
which
have
been
given
a
broad
reading,
and
that's
what
the
statute
said.
thank
you.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
certain
respects,
this
case
involves
a
rather
narrow
and
somewhat
technical
issue
of
federal
procedure
but
underlying
it
are
some
important
questions
that
relate
to
notions
of
federal
supremacy
involving
issues
of
importance
to
prison
officials
and
to
federal
governmental
officials
generally.
the
issue
in
a
nutshell
is
this,
a
federal
statute.
section
1442
(a)
(1)
of
title
28
of
the
united
states
code
provides
that
suits
against
federal
officers
may
be
removed
when
brought
in
a
state
court
to
a
federal
court
where
the
acts
that
are
alleged
to
have
occurred
about
the
basis
of
the
suit
occur
when
the
officer
is
acting
under
“color”
of
his
office.
we've
set
the
statute
out
at
page
2
of
our
brief.
it
provides
important
part
as
follows.
a
civil
action
or
a
criminal
prosecution
commenced
in
a
state
court
against
any
of
the
following
persons
may
be
removed
by
them
to
the
district
court
of
the
united
states
for
the
district
and
division
embracing
the
place
wherein
it
is
pending,
one,
any
officer
of
the
united
states
or
any
agency
thereof
or
person
acting
under
him
for
any
act
under
color
of
such
office.
the
issue
arises
here
on
the
following
facts.
respondent
daniel
morgan
was
a
prisoner
at
the
federal
penitentiary
at
leavenworth,
kansas.
he
had
been
transferred
there
in
march
1966
and
in
july
1966,
some-four
months
later,
filed
the
damage
action
which
is
the
subject
of
this
suit
in
a
kansas
state
court.
petitioners
willingham
and
jarvis
are
the
warden
--
and
were
then,
warden
and
chief
officer
of
the
federal
penitentiary
at
leavenworth.
they
were
the
only
named
defendants
in
respondent
morgan's
suit.
there
were
75
unnamed
co-defendants.
he
sought
a
total
recovery
of
an
excessive
$90
million
in
damages.
he
alleged
in
some-10
counts
a
variety
of
tortuous
acts
that
he
said
had
been
perpetrated
upon
him
by
petitioners
willingham
and
jarvis
and
the
other
75
people.
in
substance,
his
complaints
can
be
boiled
down
to
really
two
issues.
he
asserted
that
he
had
been
inoculated
with
some
dangerous
foreign
substance
which
had
caused
him
to
fall
and
injure
himself
and
that,
in
the
course
of
this
inoculation,
unauthorized
people
had
been
giving
him
medical
assistance.
and,
in
another
count,
he
asserted
in
conclusory
fashion
that
he
had
been
beaten
and
assaulted
and
tortured
in
various
respects.
petitioners
willingham
and
jarvis
filed
a
general
denial
in
the
state
court
denying
all
the
allegations
in
the
10-count
complaint
that
had
been
filed
by
respondent.
they
also
filed,
pursuant
to
section
1442
(a)
(1),
a
verified
petition
for
removal
of
this
action
from
the
kansas
state
court
to
the
federal
district
court
for
the
district
of
kansas.
in
this
removal
petition,
they
asserted
that,
at
all
relevant
times,
they
had
been
acting
in
their
official
capacities
as
warden
and
chief
medical
officer
of
leavenworth
penitentiary
and
they
set
out
the
various
counts
of
the
complaint
and
then,
at
page
9
of
the
record,
they
said
that
morgan
is,
and
was
at
all
times
mentioned,
a
dully
committed
prisoner
inmate
of
the
federal
penitentiary
at
leavenworth
and
rather
that
any
act
or
thing
that
these
petitioners,
or
either
of
them,
may
have
done
or
authorized
to
be
done
concerning
morgan,
complained
of
by
him,
was
done
and
made
by
them
in
the
course
of
their
duties
as
officers
of
the
united
states
of
america
and
as
persons
acting
under
officers
of
the
united
states
of
america
and
under
color
of
such
office
and
by
virtue
thereof.
and,
they
again
refer
to
their
officers
as
the
warden
and
chief
medical
officer.
morgan
then
filed
a
motion
in
the
federal
district
court
to
remand
the
case
back
to
the
state
court.
he
asserted
for
a
variety
of
respects
that
petitioners
were
not
acting
under
color
of
office
when
they
committed
the
acts
he
alleged
they
had
committed.
he
also
filed
a
rather
extensive
set
of
interrogatories
on
petitioner
willingham,
directed
in
substantial
part
obtaining
the
names
of
the
unnamed
unidentified
co-defendants.
with
the
district
court's
approval,
an
enlargement
of
time
to
answer
these
interrogatories
was
obtained.
the
next
step
was
petitioners
filing
for
a
summary
judgment
in
the
federal
district
court
on
the
ground
that
morgan's
suit
should
be
dismissed
under
the
so-called
official
immunity
doctrine
which
has
been
established
by
this
court
as
relating
to
executive
officials
as
well
as
judicial
and
legislative
officials
in
cases
dating
back
to
spalding
versus
vilas
and
going
through
barr
versus
matteo.
petitioners,
at
that
point,
filed
failry
extensive
affidavits
which
are
set
out
at
pages
44
and
--
through
48
of
the
defendant
appendix.
those
affidavits
detail
their
duties
as
warden
and
chief
medical
officer
at
leavenworth
and
stated
that
the
only
contact
that
they
had
had
with
respondent
morgan
was
within
the
prison
walls
at
leavenworth
and
was
in
the
course
of
their
official
duties
as
warden
and
chief
medical
officer.
respondent
morgan
opposed
dismissal
on
a
variety
of
grounds.
the
district
court
in
august
of
1966
denied
the
motion
of
respondent
morgan
to
remand
the
suit
to
the
state
court,
finding
that
removal
was
proper
under
section
1442
(a)
(1)
and
writing
a
short
opinion
in
that
regard.
subsequently,
in
december
of
1966,
the
district
court
granted
petitioner's
motion
for
summary
judgment
and
dismissed
the
suit.
in
substance,
the
basis
for
the
dismissal
was
the
district
court's
determination
that
the
suit
was
covered
by
the
official
immunity
doctrine
and
that
not
only
had
it
been
properly
removed,
but
that
it
was
subject
to
dismissal.
respondent
morgan
then
appealed
to
the
tenth
circuit
from
this
judgment,
and
both
parties
frankly
thought
that
the
issue
before
the
tenth
circuit
related
to
whether
the
district
court
had
properly
determined
that
the
requisite
--
prerequisites
for
the
official
immunity
doctrine
had
been
met
and
the
case
was
briefed
and
submitted
on
the
brief
to
the
court
on
that
basis.
however,
in
deciding
the
case,
the
tenth
circuit
found
it
unnecessary
to
reach
the
question
of
whether
the
official
immunity
defense
was
properly
invoked
here.
instead,
it,
although
it
started
out
by
saying
and
spent
most
of
its
opinion
by
discussing
the
nature
of
interrelationship
between
the
official
immunity
standard
and
the
so-called
color
of
office
test
for
removal,
it
concluded
that
the
district
court
had
erred
in
finding
that
the
suit
had
been
properly
removed.
it
said
that
“the
color
of
office
test
for
removal
was
much
narrower,”
and
that's
a
quote
from
the
court
of
appeals
opinion,
than
the
standard
of
official
immunity
and,
therefore,
it
determined
that
the
district
court
did
not
have
an
adequate
basis
on
which
--
on
the
record
that
existed,
on
which
to
determine
that
removal
was
proper
and
it
reversed
the
district
court's
decision
not
reaching
the
official
immunity
question
and
remanded
for
a
factual
determination,
in
its
words,
of
the
question
whether
removal
was
proper.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
as
i
understand
it,
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
the
district
court
needed
a
more
adequate
factual
basis
for
making
a
determination
as
to
removal
and
that
is
the
issue
that
the
court
--
the
district
court
has
directed
to
address
itself
to
on
remand.
the
court
of
appeals
did
mention,
in
passing,
that
the
--
quite
curiously,
that
it
thought
that
perhaps
the
standard
for
dismissal
on
the
basis
of
official
immunity
might
have
been
made
out
here
but,
nonetheless,
it
didn't
feel
that
the
standard
of
color
of
office
for
removal
had
been
satisfied.
we
brought
the
case
here
on
petition
for
certiorari,
which
the
court
granted,
for
several
reasons.
the
case
has
great
potential
for
substantial
mischief
if
left
standing.
there
is,
as
respondent
concedes,
an
obvious
relationship
between
the
official
immunity
doctrine
and
the
color
of
office
test
for
removal
when
suits
are
brought
against
federal
officers
in
state
courts,
as
often
they
are.
and,
peculiarly,
prison
official
such
as
are
involved
in
this
case
can
be
subjected
to
harassment
by
bringing
and
having
to
defend
against
these
kind
of
suits
if
the
standard
that
the
court
of
appeals
has
now
erected
is
left
standing.
so,
we
agree
with
the
tenth
circuit
in
only
one
respect,
and
that
is
that
the
question
that
must
be
considered
is
the
interrelationship
of
the
official
immunity
doctrine
and
the
color
of
office
test
under
the
removal
statute.
we
think,
however,
that
the
court
of
appeals
is
manifestly
wrong
in
concluding
that
the
color
of
office
test
is
narrower
than
the
official
immunity
defense.
we
think
that
simply
stands
the
law
in
its
head
because
the
result
of
that
is
that
any
suit
proper
for
removal
would
automatically
be
dismissible
and
congress,
therefore,
would've
done
a
rather
empty
act
in
proving
a
federal
forum
to
do
nothing
but
dismiss
suits.
in
effect,
petition
for
removal
would
be
an
action
to
enjoin
the
suit.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that's
the
way
we
understand
the
tenth
circuit.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
as
i
understand
the
tenth
circuit's
opinion,
yes,
sir,
assuming
that
the
state
courts
would
apply
the
defense.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that's
correct.
yes,
sir.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
what
i
think
is
--
i
think
a
number
of
things
are
wr
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
the
mischief
is,
apparently,
the
tenth
circuit
would
require
that
an
extensive
factual
inquiry
be
made
to
determine
the
threshold
issue
of
removal,
and
if
that's
so,
then
many
of
the
purposes
which
the
official
immunity
doctrine
is
supposed
to
serve
would
be
disserved
by
this
notion
because
you
would
put
these
officers
to
the
kind
of
burdens
that
barr
versus
matteo
and
related
doctrines
is
supposed
to
protect
them
against.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
i
think
congress
has
made
the
judgment
that
these
suits
in
the
main
should
be
determined
in
federal
courts.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
because
of
the
removal
provision,
yes.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i'm
not
sure
whether
they
would
or
not.
i
think
that
congress
has
made
the
judgment,
as
i
said,
that
these
suits
should
be
--
the
federal
officers
have
a
right
to
have
these
suits
determined
in
a
federal
court.
now,
we're
not
taking
the
position
that
every
suit
that
is
removed
should
be
dismissed.
indeed,
a
number
of
suits
that
in
other
circuits,
where
i
think
they
properly
construed
the
removal
statute,
they
found
removal
proper
but
have
determined
that
the
suit
is
not
dismissible
under
barr
versus
matteo
and
the
case
goes
on
to
trial.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
there
was
one
district
court
case
in
that
respect.
the
other
cases
that
it
relied
on
were
all
motor
vehicle
negligence
cases.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
the
negligence
cases
present
a
difficult
problem.
it's
no
longer
a
viable
one
because
congress
has
taken
care
of
that
by
statute
by
providing
that
where
motor
vehicle
negligence
suits
involve
actions
done
within
the
scope
of
an
employee's
performance
stay
becomes
suits
against
the
united
states
under
section
2679,
i
believe,
as
amended.
but,
our
position,
basically,
is
those
suits
are
wrong.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
but,
the
--
i
should
note
the
tenth
circuit
completely
ignored
a
whole
host
of
court
of
appeals
authority.
it
cited
district
court
decision,
but
at
least
three
courts
of
appeals
that
have
squarely
faced
this
issue,
the
second
circuit,
the
fourth
circuit,
and
the
fifth
circuit,
and
it
concluded
exactly
the
opposite.
any
comparison
of
the
reach
of
these
two
concepts
is
--
they
have
reached
the
opposite
conclusion.
i
should
note
that
the
--
what
you
asked
about
the
mischief
that
may
come
from
this
is
another
problem
and
it
involves
the
fact
that
this
doctrine
won't
relate
simply
to
prison
officials
but
would
relate
to
federal
officials
generally.
some
federal
officials
do
some
things
in
some
places
in
this
country
that
are
not
popular.
indeed,
the
whole
notion
of
removal
stemmed
from
that.
the
first
statute
was
in
1815
and
it
had
to
do
with
the
opposition
by
some
new
england
states
to
the
war
of
1812.
it
was
limited
to
customs
officials
but
it
provided
a
way
for
customs
officers
of
the
united
states
to
remove
suits
brought
against
them
when
they
were
enforcing
the
customs
laws
to
a
federal
court
instead
of
being
sued
in
a
state
court.
it
goes
on
through
the
nullification
controversy
of
1883
--
of
1833
where
it
was
extended
to
revenue
officers,
such
has
been
successively
expanded
to
include
officers
of
both
houses
of
congress
and
officers
of
the
courts,
and
then
was
expanded
in
1948
to
include
all
federal
officers.
now,
two
cases
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
excuse
me,
sir.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
that
there
may
be
a
difference
between
a
prison
guard
and
a
senior
prison
official
such
as
the
individuals
involved
here.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
because
i
think
that
the
problem
in
making
the
factual
determination
that
the
--
apparently
the
tenth
circuit
would
require
here
is
substantially
more
difficult,
as
we've
tried
to
delineate
in
a
short
reply
brief
we
filed,
for
senior
officials
such
as
these
people.
they
--
there
are
over
2,000
prisoners
at
leavenworth
and,
for
them
to
recall
what
they
were
doing
on
a
particular
day
and
whether
they
had
anything
to
do
with
those
man
at
all
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
a
prison
guard,
it
seems
to
me,
there
may
be
circumstances
under
which
suits
brought
against
him
are
not
removable.
he
obviously
has
some
authority
to
exercise
discipline
over
prisoners
but,
obviously,
he
can
go
beyond
that
and
abuse
it.
now,
this
court
has
construed
in
cases
like
classic
and
monroe
versus
pape
and
screws
versus
united
states,
analogous
provision
that
relates
to
actions
under
color
of
law
by
state
officers.
and,
the
approach
taken
there
has
been
that
even
misuse
of
power
even
if
clothes
--
clothed
with
authority
provides
the
statutory
requisite
of
color
or
law.
i
think
there
may
be
circumstances
in
which
prison
guards
go
so
beyond
the
scope
of
their
proper
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
would
have
to
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
would
have
to
know
more
about
it.
i
would
have
to
know
whether
the
guard
was
able
to
file
a
verified
swear
to
a
removal
petition.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
if
he's
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no,
that's
not
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
you
added
the
point
that
he
is
able
to
verify
that
he
didn't
do
it.
if
he
can
do
that,
i
agree
that
it
is
removable.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
if
he
can
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
if
he
can
swear
to
an
affidavit
that
he
did
not
do
these
things
alleged,
then
the
suit
is
removable.
if,
however,
in
some
cases
that
this
court
has
considered,
such
as
soper
and
symes,
involves
situations
where
the
--
in
your
hypothetical,
the
guard
obviously
had
something
to
do
with
the
individual.
there
was
some
altercation.
there
was
some
action.
he
was
there
and
something
happened,
and
so
that
presents
him
a
more
difficult
case.
he
can't
simply
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think,
in
terms
of
the
--
of
how
elaborated
a
statement
is
required
in
order
to
justify
removal,
there
may
be
some
difference
regarding
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no,
i
don't
agree
with
the
tenth
circuit.
all
that
i
suggest
is
that
there
might
be
some
difference
if
the
individual
is
not
able
to
respond
by
filing
a
verified
removal
petition
that
he
simply
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
we've
not
urged
the
court
to
do
that.
the
tenth
circuit
didn't
reach
it.
of
course,
the
district
court
did.
if
the
court
feels
that
on
the
basis
of
the
record
that
it's
available
to
the
court,
that
it
can
uphold
the
district
court's
determination
in
that
regard,
of
course
the
government
would
feel
that
that
was
fine.
on
the
other
hand,
we're
not
urging
that
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
quite
properly,
your
honor,
that's
the
only
question
of
the
court
of
appeals
reached
and
it's
a
little
bit
difficult
for
us
to
urge
that
the
court
go
beyond
that
but,
as
i
said,
we
would
not
be
upset
by
that
approach
either.
i
was
going
to
mention,
in
response
to
justice
white's
question,
that
there
is
some
real
potential
for
mischief
here
in
the
tenth
circuit's
narrow
reading
of
the
removal
statute,
and
two
cases
i
think
show
why
this
is
so.
one
case
is
called
perez
versus
bridal
hoover.
it
was
brought
by
leander
perez
down
in
louisiana
against
federal
voting
examiners
in
a
state
court,
seeking
to
prevent
them
from
carrying
out
the
functions
that
congress
had
charged
them
with
carrying
out.
now,
they
sought
to
remove
that
case.
the
question
there
was
whether
they
were
acting
under
color
of
office.
now,
if
federal
officials
seeking
to
enforce
laws
like
this
are
required
to
come
forward
with
a
substantial
showing
that
they
were
acting
within
the
scope
of
their
official
duties
and
the
delay
and
the
harassment
in
predictiveness
that
comes
from
that
is
permissible,
then
i
think
that
there
is
a
real
mischief.
another
case
that
the
court
is
familiar
with
is
norton
versus
mcshane
which
came
out
of
the
meredith
incident
at
the
university
of
mississippi
where
suit
was
brought
by
individuals
down
in
mississippi
against
marshall,
mcshane,
and
others.
there,
removal
was
sought
in
the
state
court
and
was
granted,
but
if
you
read
the
statute
narrowly
and
you
can't
obtain
removal
without
a
thorough-going
extensive
factual
inquiry,
then
there
is
a
real
potential
for
mischief
and
hazard.
we
think
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
itself
supports
our
reading.
it
says
color
of
office.
it
doesn't
say
within
his
official
duties.
it
says
under
color
of
office.
as
i
mentioned,
the
courts
construed
other
similar
provisions
in
a
broad
fashion.
also,
it
seems
to
us
that,
while
respondent
here
has
more
or
less
conceded
that
the
tenth
circuit's
result
is
indefensible,
he's
possession
is
not
satisfactory
either.
in
short,
he
says
that,
while
the
tenth
circuit
may
have
erred
in
determining
the
comparative
reach
of
the
two
statutes,
it
did
not
err
in
determining
that
the
record
here
was
inadequate
for
the
district
court
to
determine
the
question
of
removal.
we
think,
on
the
facts
presented
and
for
the
reasons
developed
in
some
length
in
our
brief
and
in
our
reply
brief,
that
this
simply
is
not
so
and
that
if
you
say
at
least
as
to
officials
like
these
that
they
must
do
more
than
they've
done
here.
deny
the
charges,
assert
that
all
the
actions
occurred
within
the
prison
walls,
and
assert
that
anything
that
was
done
occurred
within
color
of
their
office
that,
inevitably,
you're
going
to
have
the
extensive
kind
of
litigation
on
this
threshold
issue
that's
gone
into
fee
most
of
the
purposes
of
the
official
immunity
doctrine
and,
i
think,
also
subvert
congress'
intent
in
enacting
the
statute.
i'd
like
to
save
the
time
i
have
left.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
this
particular
statute
dates
back
to
--
well,
1815
was
the
first
time
a
removal
statute
was
passed.
that
related
to
customs
officers
and
it
has
been
expanded
since
that
time.
in
1948,
it
was
expanded
to
include
all
federal
officers.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
the
passage
of
the
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
the
passage
of
the
first
law,
as
i
understand,
had
to
do
with
the
opposition
of
some
new
england
states
with
the
war
of
1812
and
they
didn't
want
federal
officers
collecting
customs
duties
up
there.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
just
several
points,
i
think
mr.
justice
marshall
put
his
finger
on
the
real
problem
here.
let's
assume
that
none
of
these
acts
occurred.
this
is
the
basic
position
of
petitioners.
they
didn't
do
anything
to
harm
this
man.
what
else
can
they
do?
they
denied
it.
they
said
that
any
contact
they
had
with
him
was
within
the
prison
walls
and
they
said
they
were
acting
within
their
official
duties,
and
they
said
that
they
were
the
warden
and
the
chief
medical
officer.
now,
respondent
keep
saying
“well,
we
need
more
facts.”
well,
i
submit
that
if
there
are
no
more
facts
to
refer
to,
i
don't
know
short
of
what
mr.
justice
marshall
suggested
that
they
must
admit
that
they
did
something
wrong,
they
can
do.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
i
agree
with
you
on
that.
i
don't
see
how
you
could
take
any
other
position.
it
seems
to
me,
the
district
court
had
before
it
controverted
allegations.
it
had
factual
circumstances
and
it
had
to
seek
to
apply
the
statute
against
that.
and,
it
seems
to
me
that,
in
the
circumstances,
there
wasn't
anything
else
that
he
can
do.
the
reliance
on
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
that's
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that
that's
correct,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
any
of
that
would've
been
subject
to
the
same
claim
that
it
was
conlusi
--
conclusionary
in
nature
and,
therefore,
inadequate
and
it
seems
to
us
that
the
district
court
had
an
adequate
basis
here
and
that
section
1446
on
which
respondent
now
relies
is
mentioned
by
the
court
of
appeals
only
in
one
sense.
it
said
that
all
the
requirements
thereof
were
met.
so,
in
conclusion,
we
submit
that
the
sope
and
symes
cases,
as
justice
stewart
pointed
out,
were
criminal
cases.
and,
there,
at
least
everybody
agreed
something
had
occurred
and,
therefore,
we
don't
think
they
are
controlling
here
and,
in
our
view,
the
court
of
appeals
is
wrong
and
we
submit
its
judgment
should
be
reversed.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
course
of
employment
is
a
somewhat
different
notion.
i
think
that
the
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
it
may
not
be
enough,
your
honor.
but,
again,
you
have
notions
of
--
you
have
the
notion
of
color
of
office
which
have
been
given
a
broad
reading,
and
that's
what
the
statute
said.
thank
you.
