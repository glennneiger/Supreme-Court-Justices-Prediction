mr.
joseph
m.
snee
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
rather
unique
case,
in
that,
the
respondent
here
would
submit
to
the
court
that
the
result
reached
by
the
court
of
appeals
was
quite
correct
but
for
the
wrong
reasons.
as
we've
made
clear
in
our
brief,
there
is
neither
reason
nor
authority
to
support
the
views
expressed
by
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
tenth
circuit
on
the
alleged
interrelationship
between
the
immunity
standards
and
the
color
of
office
test.
however,
we
say
that
the
court
was
correct
in
reaching
its
result.
we
do
not
concede,
as
counsel
has
just
stated,
that
the
result
was
incorrect,
and
we
say
that
for
the
reason
that
the
record
in
this
case
was
clearly
inadequate,
both
under
section
1446
(a)
of
title
28
of
the
code
and
prior
decision
of
this
court,
clearly
inadequate
to
support
federal
jurisdiction
on
removal.
if
one
fact
stands
out
in
this
case,
it
is
that
the
record
is
singularly
to
void
effects.
the
only
uncontroverted
fact
in
the
record,
as
was
pointed
out
by
the
court
of
appeals,
is
that,
at
all
times,
the
only
contact
which
the
petitioners
had
with
the
respondent
were
within
the
walls
of
leavenworth
prison.
in
some
of
the
case
--
on
the
case
which
is
cited
by
the
court
involving
automobile
accidents,
a
--
the
majority
saw
there
was
no
color
of
office
on
the
part
of
the
driver
of
the
automobile
and,
therefore,
no
removal
--
excuse
me,
removability,
a
matter
which
is
now
corrected
by
the
federal
tort
claims
act
giving
removability
under
a
different
section.
in
none
of
those
cases,
however,
was
immunity
involved.
clearly,
there's
no
immunity
under
barr
versus
matteo
in
the
part
of
an
automobile
driver
who
was
being
charged
with
negligence
is
not
exercising
any
sort
of
discretionary
act.
one
case,
brown
versus
mcburnett,
involving
1442
(a)
(3),
court
officials
held
there
was
a
right
of
removability
for
two
deputy
martials
who's
transporting
a
federal
prisoner
to
a
penitentiary
because
they
were
in
their
performance
of
their
duties
under
that
section
of
statute
and,
clearly
again,
there
was
no
immunity.
now,
the
question
of,
as
the
respondent
sees
it,
the
right
of
removability
is
oen
which
is
conferred
by
statute
and
the
requirements
of
the
statute
must
be
met.
congress
did
not
see
fit,
if
indeed
it
could
do
so,
did
not
see
fit
to
allow
removability
of
every
case
or
prosecution
against
a
federal
officer
simply
because
he
was
a
federal
officer.
in
the
various
sections
of
this
statute,
various
tests
are
put
down
for
the
different
categories
of
persons
who
are
covered.
and,
as
a
district
court
case
has
said,
congress
knew
what
it
meant,
knew
how
to
say
what
it
meant
in
these
statutes,
and
they
put
down
under
color
of
office.
this
court,
section
1446
(a)
requires
that
the
petition
contain
a
claim
and
short
statement
of
facts.
we're
not
left,
however,
with
that
bear
statutory
requirement
because
this
court
in
two
cases,
maryland
versus
soper
and
colorado
versus
symes,
where
there
was
a
far
more
detailed
statement
of
facts
than
is
present
in
this
record,
in
both
cases,
held
that
the
case
should
be
remanded
to
the
district
court
--
to
the
state
court.
those
are
both
cases
--
mr.
joseph
m.
snee
prohibition
agents
who
have
come
out
of
the
revenue
part
of
this
statute,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
m.
snee
they
are
both
criminal
cases,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
m.
snee
right.
mr.
joseph
m.
snee
in
both
cases.
mr.
joseph
m.
snee
well,
your
honor,
that
allegation
was
made
first
in
the
petition
--
in
the
affidavit
supporting
the
motion
for
salary
judgment
and
was
evidently
cast
in
the
terms
of
barr
versus
matteo,
an
immunity
rather
than
removability.
and,
if
it
does
not
seem
ficicious,
i
would
say,
not
misinterpreting
the
mind
of
this
court
in
barr
versus
matteo,
say
that
the
outer
perimeter
of
duties
measured
by
the
walls
of
leavenworth
penitentiary.
but,
the
only
--
it's
the
only
uncontroverted
fact.
now,
in
maryland
versus
soper,
it
was
clear
that
the
officers
were
present
in
the
performance
of
their
duty,
but
the
--
this
court
held
that
that
was
not
sufficient
because
they
had
to
show
that
they
were
doing
nothing
other
than
official
duties
at
the
time
this
homicide
occurred,
and
they
had
not,
by
a
candid
specific
positive
statement
if
facts,
given
the
court
a
basis
upon
which
to
reach
this
determination.
both
the
petitioners
and
the
respondents
engaged
in
the
battle
of
conclusionary
statements
which
will
be
inadmissible
as
evidence.
color
of
office
is
a
conclusion
of
law
which
must
be
made
by
the
court
on
the
basis
of
facts
and
submit
it
by
the
person
who
seeks
removal.
and,
the
burden
of
proof
is
upon
him,
quite
differently
from
the
situations
existed
in
norton
versus
mcshane
where
a
conclusionary
affidavit
by
the
attorney
general
that
they
were
active
within
the
performance
of
their
duty
was
regard
as
efficient
because,
there,
as
in
every
case,
the
burden
of
proof
is
on
the
plaintiff,
and
he
made
no
attempt
to
controvert
this
statement.
the
fundamental
error
respondent
submits
was
even
comparing
these
two
concepts
of
immunity
and
removability.
they
are
different
in
origin.
they
are
different
in
purpose.
they
are
different
in
test.
they
are
different
in
effect.
and,
to
try
to
compare
the
two
of
them
is
like
asking
is
a
horse
better
than
a
cow.
it's
a
--
they
belong
to
two
different
quarters,
two
different
categories.
each
would
stand
upon
its
own
two
feet.
for
the
reason
which
have
been
suggested
by
the
petitioners
in
their
brief
and
after
very
careful
analysis
of
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
as
distinguished
from
its
judgment,
i
think
it's
incorrect
to
say
that
the
removal
power
or
removal
test
is
far
narrower
than
the
immunity
standard
but,
if
for
the
same
reasons,
it's
also
incorrect
to
suggest
as
chasing
too
that
the
removal
power
is
far
more
wider
than.
they
are
in
different
quarters
and
different
categories,
and
we've
been
told
that
the
decision
of
the
court
below
puts
the
law
on
its
head.
i
would
suggest
to
try
to
establish
the
jurisdiction
of
a
court
under
the
removal
statute
by
determining
that
immunity
was
present.
it's
put
in
the
cart
before
the
horse.
and,
we
must
have
jurisdiction
established
before
we
enter
into
the
immunity
question.
now,
the
record
in
this
case
did
not
sustain
that
burden
of
proof
which
this
court
has
recognized.
mr.
joseph
m.
snee
perhaps
i
can
best
answer
that
question,
mr.
justice
black,
by
saying
what
was
not
alleged
in
this
case.
in
the
affidavits
which
were
submitted
--
mr.
joseph
m.
snee
well,
i
shall,
your
honor.
they
have
to
some
--
allege
some
fact
which
ties
the
alleged
act
into
their
official
duties.
in
their
affidavit,
there
was
a
long
list
of
their
official
duties,
but
i
think
it's
highly
significant
that
nowhere
in
that
affidavit
do
they
even
mention
any
of
the
incidents
which
were
raised
in
the
respondent's
complaint.
they
do
not
make
the
slightest
effort
to
tie
those
in.
now,
they
only
have
to
do
it
with
regard
to
one
act
in
order
to
confer
jurisdiction
upon
the
federal
court.
mr.
joseph
m.
snee
no,
there
is
no
mention
of
these
incidents.
mr.
joseph

mr.

mr.

mr.

mr.

he
says
so,
and
this
is

party.
he

officer
were
not
acting
within

mr.

it
is
not

because,
other

acts

committed
within
prisons
and
with
regarded
to
the
question
that
mr.
justice
fortas
raised,
i
think
that
it
might
be
fairly
easy
to
establish
removability
in
the
case
of
the
prison

who
beat,
but
certainly
not

mr.

at

some
of

were

alleged

are
circumstances
where

mr.

removal

is
upon

well,

a
situation.
suppose
this

due

facts
which
are

by
the

in
their
removal
petition
or
in
their
subsequent
affidavits,
do
they
negate
--
do
they
give
any
facts
to
negate
the
idea
that
the
doctor
may
have
been
engaged
in
some
kind
of
strange
research
and
not
--
mr.
joseph

but,
again
--
mr.
joseph
m.
snee
because
this
court
so
held
in
maryland
versus
soper,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
m.
snee
maryland
versus
soper,
that
the
allegation
had
to
be
sufficient
to
show
that
not
only
were
they
at
the
time
performing
their
official
duties,
but
they
weren't
performing
any
other
acts
which
were
not
related
to
their
official
duties.
that
was
the
holding
of
this
court
in
maryland
versus
soper,
that
they
were
not
doing
any
other
things
besides
official
duties
at
the
time.
mr.
joseph
m.
snee
they
should
allege
some
fact.
mr.
joseph
m.
snee
the
only
answer
i'd
have
to
that,
your
honor,
is
that
we're
dealing
with
the
jurisdictional
method
of
it.
mr.
joseph
m.
snee
well,
perhaps
a
distinction
should
be
drawn
between
a
case
which
is
removed
under
1441
where
the
pleadings
themselves
must
establish
that
the
district
court
would
have
original
jurisdiction,
and
1442
(a)
where
the
sole
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
court
is
derivative.
no
cause
of
action
is
created
by
1442.
the
cause
of
action
must
already
exist,
as
pointed
out
by
this
court
in
wheeler
versus
wheeldin
--
or
wheeldin
versus
wheeler.
the
facts
which
are
necessary
for
removal
need
not
be
contained
in
the
petition.
in
one
case,
logan
versus
stock
was
held
that
effect
in
the
petition
removal
was
satisfied
by
the
--
cured
by
the
fact
that
the
necessary
jurisdictional
facts
were
contained
in
the
attached
complaint.
mr.
joseph
m.
snee
that's
true,
your
honor.
it's
the
only
burden.
mr.
joseph
m.
snee
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
rather
unique
case,
in
that,
the
respondent
here
would
submit
to
the
court
that
the
result
reached
by
the
court
of
appeals
was
quite
correct
but
for
the
wrong
reasons.
as
we've
made
clear
in
our
brief,
there
is
neither
reason
nor
authority
to
support
the
views
expressed
by
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
tenth
circuit
on
the
alleged
interrelationship
between
the
immunity
standards
and
the
color
of
office
test.
however,
we
say
that
the
court
was
correct
in
reaching
its
result.
we
do
not
concede,
as
counsel
has
just
stated,
that
the
result
was
incorrect,
and
we
say
that
for
the
reason
that
the
record
in
this
case
was
clearly
inadequate,
both
under
section
1446
(a)
of
title
28
of
the
code
and
prior
decision
of
this
court,
clearly
inadequate
to
support
federal
jurisdiction
on
removal.
if
one
fact
stands
out
in
this
case,
it
is
that
the
record
is
singularly
to
void
effects.
the
only
uncontroverted
fact
in
the
record,
as
was
pointed
out
by
the
court
of
appeals,
is
that,
at
all
times,
the
only
contact
which
the
petitioners
had
with
the
respondent
were
within
the
walls
of
leavenworth
prison.
in
some
of
the
case
--
on
the
case
which
is
cited
by
the
court
involving
automobile
accidents,
a
--
the
majority
saw
there
was
no
color
of
office
on
the
part
of
the
driver
of
the
automobile
and,
therefore,
no
removal
--
excuse
me,
removability,
a
matter
which
is
now
corrected
by
the
federal
tort
claims
act
giving
removability
under
a
different
section.
in
none
of
those
cases,
however,
was
immunity
involved.
clearly,
there's
no
immunity
under
barr
versus
matteo
in
the
part
of
an
automobile
driver
who
was
being
charged
with
negligence
is
not
exercising
any
sort
of
discretionary
act.
one
case,
brown
versus
mcburnett,
involving
1442
(a)
(3),
court
officials
held
there
was
a
right
of
removability
for
two
deputy
martials
who's
transporting
a
federal
prisoner
to
a
penitentiary
because
they
were
in
their
performance
of
their
duties
under
that
section
of
statute
and,
clearly
again,
there
was
no
immunity.
now,
the
question
of,
as
the
respondent
sees
it,
the
right
of
removability
is
oen
which
is
conferred
by
statute
and
the
requirements
of
the
statute
must
be
met.
congress
did
not
see
fit,
if
indeed
it
could
do
so,
did
not
see
fit
to
allow
removability
of
every
case
or
prosecution
against
a
federal
officer
simply
because
he
was
a
federal
officer.
in
the
various
sections
of
this
statute,
various
tests
are
put
down
for
the
different
categories
of
persons
who
are
covered.
and,
as
a
district
court
case
has
said,
congress
knew
what
it
meant,
knew
how
to
say
what
it
meant
in
these
statutes,
and
they
put
down
under
color
of
office.
this
court,
section
1446
(a)
requires
that
the
petition
contain
a
claim
and
short
statement
of
facts.
we're
not
left,
however,
with
that
bear
statutory
requirement
because
this
court
in
two
cases,
maryland
versus
soper
and
colorado
versus
symes,
where
there
was
a
far
more
detailed
statement
of
facts
than
is
present
in
this
record,
in
both
cases,
held
that
the
case
should
be
remanded
to
the
district
court
--
to
the
state
court.
those
are
both
cases
--

have

part
of

mr.

they
are
both
criminal

mr.

mr.
joseph

cases.
mr.
joseph
m.

well,
your
honor,
that
allegation
was
made
first
in
the
petition
--
in
the
affidavit
supporting
the
motion
for
salary
judgment
and
was
evidently
cast
in
the
terms
of
barr
versus
matteo,
an
immunity
rather
than
removability.
and,
if
it
does
not
seem
ficicious,
i
would
say,
not
misinterpreting
the
mind
of
this
court
in
barr
versus
matteo,
say
that
the
outer
perimeter
of
duties
measured
by
the
walls
of
leavenworth
penitentiary.
but,
the
only
--
it's
the
only
uncontroverted
fact.
now,
in
maryland
versus
soper,
it
was
clear
that
the
officers
were
present
in
the
performance
of
their
duty,
but
the
--
this
court
held
that
that
was
not
sufficient
because
they
had
to
show
that
they
were
doing
nothing
other
than
official
duties
at
the
time
this
homicide
occurred,
and
they
had
not,
by
a
candid
specific
positive
statement
if
facts,
given
the
court
a
basis
upon
which
to
reach
this
determination.
both
the
petitioners
and
the
respondents
engaged
in
the
battle
of
conclusionary
statements
which
will
be
inadmissible
as
evidence.
color
of
office
is
a
conclusion
of
law
which
must
be
made
by
the
court
on
the
basis
of
facts
and
submit
it
by
the
person
who
seeks
removal.
and,
the
burden
of
proof
is
upon
him,
quite
differently
from
the
situations
existed
in
norton
versus
mcshane
where
a
conclusionary
affidavit
by
the
attorney
general
that
they
were
active
within
the
performance
of
their
duty
was
regard
as
efficient
because,
there,
as
in
every
case,
the
burden
of
proof
is
on
the
plaintiff,
and
he
made
no
attempt
to
controvert
this
statement.
the
fundamental
error
respondent
submits
was
even
comparing
these
two
concepts
of
immunity
and
removability.
they
are
different
in
origin.
they
are
different
in
purpose.
they
are
different
in
test.
they
are
different
in
effect.
and,
to
try
to
compare
the
two
of
them
is
like
asking
is
a
horse
better
than
a
cow.
it's
a
--
they
belong
to
two
different
quarters,
two
different
categories.
each
would
stand
upon
its
own
two
feet.
for
the
reason
which
have
been
suggested
by
the
petitioners
in
their
brief
and
after
very
careful
analysis
of
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
as
distinguished
from
its
judgment,
i
think
it's
incorrect
to
say
that
the
removal
power
or
removal
test
is
far
narrower
than
the
immunity
standard
but,
if
for
the
same
reasons,
it's
also
incorrect
to
suggest
as
chasing
too
that
the
removal
power
is
far
more
wider
than.
they
are
in
different
quarters
and
different
categories,
and
we've
been
told
that
the
decision
of
the
court
below
puts
the
law
on
its
head.
i
would
suggest
to
try
to
establish
the
jurisdiction
of
a
court
under
the
removal
statute
by
determining
that
immunity
was
present.
it's
put
in
the
cart
before
the
horse.
and,
we
must
have
jurisdiction
established
before
we
enter
into
the
immunity
question.
now,
the
record
in
this
case
did
not
sustain
that
burden
of
proof
which
this
court
has
recognized.
mr.
joseph
m.
snee
perhaps
i
can
best
answer
that
question,
mr.
justice
black,
by
saying
what
was
not
alleged
in
this
case.
in
the
affidavits
which
were
submitted
--
mr.
joseph
m.
snee
well,
i
shall,
your
honor.
they
have
to
some
--
allege
some
fact
which
ties
the
alleged
act
into
their
official
duties.
in
their
affidavit,
there
was
a
long
list
of
their
official
duties,
but
i
think
it's
highly
significant
that
nowhere
in
that
affidavit
do
they
even
mention
any
of
the
incidents
which
were
raised
in
the
respondent's
complaint.
they
do
not
make
the
slightest
effort
to
tie
those
in.
now,
they
only
have
to
do
it
with
regard
to
one
act
in
order
to
confer
jurisdiction
upon
the
federal
court.
mr.
joseph

as
this
court
said,
to
show
the

were
not
connected
with
unofficial
activities.
mr.
joseph
m.
snee
no,
there
must
be
facts.
mr.
joseph
m.
snee
that
is
what
i
find
hard
to
understand
from
the
opinion
of
this
court
in
maryland
versus
soper
because
the
petition
there
was
so
detailed
in
its
allegations
of
facts.
i
don't
know
quite
what
else
he
could
have
alleged.
mr.
joseph
m.
snee
i
suppose
a
good
deal
depends
upon
the
allegations
in
the
original
complaint
as
to
what
he
would
have
to
say.
he
does
not
have
to
admit
that
he
did
the
acts,
but
he
does
have
to
show
that,
if
they
were
committed,
they
were
committed
in
some
way
in
some
causal
connection
with
his
official
duties,
that
he
was
not
off
on
a
frolic
of
his
own
or
that
he
wasn't
warden
at
the
time.
the
interrogatories
raised
some
question
as
to
this,
as
was
pointed
out
--
mr.
joseph
m.
snee
and
as
--
mr.
joseph
m.
snee
well,
my
comment
on
that,
your
honor,
would
be
that
paragraph
8,
in
most
parts,
is
conclusionary
in
nature,
and
i
would
think
that
the
burden
of
going
forward
with
the
proof
does
not
shift
until
there's
been
some
proof.
mr.
joseph
m.
snee
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
m.
snee
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
m.
snee
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
m.
snee
no,
your
honor,
i
think
it
was
very
simple.
mr.
joseph
m.
snee
it
would
be
very
simple
to
submit
an
ordinary
medical
record
showing
that
this
was
the
ordinary
medical
treatment,
and
this
negates
then
any
possibility
--
mr.
joseph
m.
snee
the
doctor
was
--
mr.
joseph
m.
snee
he
have
actually
--
mr.
joseph
m.
snee
he
alleges
that
they
did
this
on
a
frolic
of
their
own.
mr.
joseph
m.
snee
yes,
in
the
complaint,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
m.
snee
in
his
complaint.
mr.
joseph
m.
snee
it's
actually
--
i
maybe
wrong
on
that,
your
honor.
it
may
be
in
the
motion
for
remand
to
the
state
court.
mr.
joseph
m.
snee
well,
i
would
suppose
a
hypothetical
question,
your
honor,
a
situation.
suppose
this
--
due
the
facts
which
are
given
by
the
petitioners
in
their
removal
petition
or
in
their
subsequent
affidavits,
do
they
negate
--
do
they
give
any
facts
to
negate
the
idea
that
the
doctor
may
have
been
engaged
in
some
kind
of
strange
research
and
not
--
mr.
joseph
m.
snee
but,
again
--
mr.
joseph
m.
snee
because
this
court
so
held
in
maryland
versus
soper,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
m.
snee
maryland
versus
soper,
that
the
allegation
had
to
be
sufficient
to
show
that
not
only
were
they
at
the
time
performing
their
official
duties,
but
they
weren't
performing
any
other
acts
which
were
not
related
to
their
official
duties.
that
was
the
holding
of
this
court
in
maryland
versus
soper,
that
they
were
not
doing
any
other
things
besides
official
duties
at
the
time.
mr.
joseph
m.
snee
they
should
allege
some
fact.
mr.
joseph
m.
snee
the
only
answer
i'd
have
to
that,
your
honor,
is
that
we're
dealing
with
the
jurisdictional
method
of
it.
mr.
joseph
m.
snee
well,
perhaps
a
distinction
should
be
drawn
between
a
case
which
is
removed
under
1441
where
the
pleadings
themselves
must
establish
that
the
district
court
would
have
original
jurisdiction,
and
1442
(a)
where
the
sole
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
court
is
derivative.
no
cause
of
action
is
created
by
1442.
the
cause
of
action
must
already
exist,
as
pointed
out
by
this
court
in
wheeler
versus
wheeldin
--
or
wheeldin
versus
wheeler.
the
facts
which
are
necessary
for
removal
need
not
be
contained
in
the
petition.
in
one
case,
logan
versus
stock
was
held
that
effect
in
the
petition
removal
was
satisfied
by
the
--
cured
by
the
fact
that
the
necessary
jurisdictional
facts
were
contained
in
the
attached
complaint.
mr.
joseph
m.
snee
that's
true,
your
honor.
it's
the
only
burden.
