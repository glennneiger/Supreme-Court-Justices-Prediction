mr.
warren
christopher
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
civil
antitrust
case
which
comes
here
directly
from
the
southern
district
of
new
york.
the
court
below
dismissed
the
government's
complaint
which
had
charged
that
the
defendant's
activity
has
violated
section
1
of
the
sherman
act.
the
issue
presented
here
is
whether
or
not
the
antitrust
exemption
of
the
webb-pomerene
act
extends
to
the
procurement
of
goods
under
the
united
states
for
foreign
aid
program
where
the
goods
are
shipped
abroad
and
where
the
funds
to
pay
for
the
goods
come
from
the
united
states
treasury.
the
facts
are
all
stipulated
here
and
they're
not
in
dispute.
the
defendants
below
appellees
here
are
five
major
united
states
corporations
which
produce
concentrated
phosphate
and
the
export
association
which
they
formed
in
1961
and
which
is
called
the
concentrated
phosphate
export
association.
this
association
was
organized
in
order
to
enable
these
members
to
act
jointly
in
the
overseas
sales
of
phosphate
which
is
used
in
the
production
of
plant
food
or
fertilizer.
the
association
is
properly
registered
with
the
federal
trade
commission
under
the
webb-pomerene
act.
now,
the
board
of
directors
of
this
association
determines
the
prices
at
which
the
corporate
members
of
the
association
will
sell
their
phosphate
to
the
association
and
it
determines
the
prices
at
which
the
association
will
sell
the
phosphate
to
others.
in
addition,
the
board
of
directors
of
the
association
also
allocates
the
available
business
among
the
members
of
the
association.
transactions
here
on
issue
involved
some
43
million
dollars
in
sales
to
the
republic
of
korea
by
the
export
association.
these
sales
were
all
made
pursuant
to
our
united
states
foreign
aid
program.
indeed,
under
this
program,
the
united
states
through
aid,
the
agency
for
international
development
has
been
making
grants
to
korea
since
1953.
two
basic
methods
of
procurement
are
involved
in
this
case
in
two
of
the
transactions
which
are
before
the
court
involving
some
8
million
dollars.
the
procurement
was
handled
by
the
united
states
general
services
administration.
in
that
situation,
gsa
issued
a
standard
invitation
to
bid,
accepted
the
low
bid
on
behalf
of
the
united
states,
paid
the
association,
took
delivery
of
the
phosphate
and
arrange
for
it
shipment
to
korea.
in
nine
other
transactions
before
the
court
involving
some
35
million
dollars,
eight
authorize
the
office
of
supply
of
the
republic
of
korea
to
handle
the
procurement
of
the
phosphate.
each
face
of
this
transaction
however
was
rigidly
controlled
by
aid.
in
these
transactions,
the
phosphate
association
was
paid
by
united
states
bank
which
in
turn
received
its
funds
from
the
united
states
treasury.
whichever
method
of
procurement
was
followed,
either
through
gsa
or
through
the
office
of
supply
of
the
republic
of
korea,
aid
supervised
every
aspect
of
the
transaction.
until
final
delivery,
the
aid
--
aid
retained
the
right
to
divert
the
shipment.
as
indicated
above,
my
comments
in
both
cases,
the
funds
for
the
phosphate
came
from
the
united
states
treasury.
the
court
below
said,
aid
initiated
controlled,
directed,
and
financed
the
transactions
involved.
mr.
warren
christopher
yes
and
then
transshipped
to
korea.
mr.
warren
christopher
the
--
mr.
warren
christopher
gsa
did
take
the
--
mr.
warren
christopher
my
understanding
of
the
transaction
mr.
justice
fortas
is
that
the
goods,
the
phosphate
in
each
case
were
shipped
from
florida
to
korea
but
in
the
gsa
transaction,
gsa
actually
took
legal
control
of
the
goods
before
they
were
shipped
out
from
the
country.
on
the
other
hand,
the
government
makes
no
distinction
between
the
two
types
of
transactions.
we
think
we
do
not
argue
that
there
is
a
legal
difference
between
the
two
types
of
transactions.
mr.
warren
christopher
well,
mr.
justice
fortas,
we
think
the
crucial
fact
here
is
that
the
funds
came
from
the
united
states
treasury
and
that
the
transaction
was
controlled
in
every
respect
by
aid.
we
do
not
think
that
the
legal
steps
in
the
procurement
differed
significantly
to
make
the
legal
difference
between
the
gsa
procurement
and
the
republic
of
korea
procurement.
mr.
warren
christopher
yes,
sir
and
i
believe
the
stipulation
bears
that
out
mr.
justice.
mr.
warren
christopher
with
respect
to
the
other
transactions,
the
republic
of
korea
sought
the
bids
in
korea,
bids
were
made
there
and
the
phosphate
was
transferred
i
believe
from
the
export
association
to
the
korean
government
in
korea.
mr.
warren
christopher
no,
sir.
i
think
that
in
all
the
transactions
before
the
court,
all
11
of
the
transactions,
the
united
states
should
prevail
because
the
funds
came
from
united
states
treasury.
mr.
warren
christopher
well,
mr.
justice,
i
think
the
differences
between
the
two
types
of
procurement
are
not
significant
to
make
it
turn
on
those
factors
sir.
now,
under
the
stipulation,
korea
is
under
no
obligation
to
repay
the
funds
expanded
to
the
united
states.
however,
so
that
the
matter
is
fairly
before
the
court,
i
should
say
that
when
korea
sells
the
phosphate
to
private
purchasers
in
korea,
the
funds
generated
which
are
not
necessarily
equal
to
the
value
of
united
states
must
be
set
aside
as
counterpart
funds.
these
funds
have
been
used
in
practice
mostly
to
support
the
korean
defense
establishment
but
as
i
say,
the
stipulation
makes
clear
that
korea
is
under
no
obligation
to
repay
the
funds
expended
in
these
procurements.
in
1964,
the
united
states
filed
a
complaint
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york
charging
that
the
activities
of
this
association
constituted
illegal
price
fixing
and
an
allocation
of
business
in
violation
of
section
1
of
the
sherman
act.
the
court
below
dismissed
the
complaint
holding
that
the
transactions
were
within
the
web-pomerene
exemption.
in
the
view
of
the
court
below,
because
the
goods
were
shipped
to
a
foreign
country,
the
district
court
thought
they
constituted
export
trade
within
the
meaning
of
the
act.
however,
the
district
court
noted
in
its
opinion
that
it
seems
obviously
unfair
to
the
united
states
to
permit
the
defendants
to
charge
and
artificially
set
price
and
to
deprive
the
united
states
of
the
benefits
which
might
come
from
price
competition
between
the
association
notwithstanding
that
statement,
the
district
court
felt
that
the
exports
here
were
within
the
exception
--
exemption
of
the
webb-pomerene
act
and
therefore
held
that
the
government's
complaint
must
be
dismissed.
mr.
warren
christopher
mr.
justice
white,
there
was
competition
between
the
association
and
other
foreign
bidders
and
other
bidders
from
the
united
states.
mr.
warren
christopher
that's
correct
mr.
justice
white.
the
extent
of
them
can
be
indicated
from
the
fact
that
they
made
less
than
16%
of
the
bids
and
got
less
than
18%
of
the
business.
but
under
our
theory
of
the
case,
the
presence
of
foreign
competition
even
to
that
limited
degree
does
not
change
what
we
regard
as
the
proper
result
and
that
is
that
where
united
states
pays
the
bill
and
where
aid
supervises
the
transaction,
the
webb-pomerene
exemption
should
not
apply.
mr.
warren
christopher
that's
correct.
mr.
warren
christopher
well,
the
basic
purpose
of
the
act
was
to
enable
the
american
exporters
to
compete
in
foreign
markets
for
what
i
would
call
traditional
foreign
business
where
the
foreign
source
pays
the
money.
now
the
framers
of
the
act
were
very
careful
to
make
sure
that
there'll
be
no
injury
to
the
american
consumer,
to
the
american
taxpayer.
now,
i
think
it's
that
legislative
purpose
which
illuminates
the
act
and
which
makes
it
clear
here
that
where
uncle
sam
pays
the
bill
and
aids
and
supervises
the
transaction
that
the
exception
does
not
apply.
our
--
it
seems
to
me
that
as
we
look
at
the
webb-pomerene
act,
we
must
look
at
the
underlying
reasons,
we're
not
prisoner
of
the
dictionary
by
any
means,
i
think
our
obligation
is
to
look
at
the
history
and
purpose
of
congress.
as
just
indicated
in
my
comments
to
mr.
justice
white,
congress
was
trying
in
this
act
to
give
the
american
exporters
a
better
chance
to
compete
against
foreign
monopolies
especially
foreign
buying
cartels.
the
philosophy
of
the
act
was
united
states
business
is
it
should
be
freed
of
antitrust
restraints
and
their
approach
to
foreign
market.
congress
thought
it
was
acting
primarily
to
aid
small
companies
which
had
thought
could
not
compete
effectively
in
foreign
markets
unless
they
could
act
jointly.
now,
the
purpose
of
the
act
in
my
view
was
frankly
a
very
chauvinistic
one.
both
of
them
in
for
whom
the
act
is
named
emphasized
this
point.
in
the
house,
congressman
web
indicated
his
willingness
to
allow
a
combination
between
anyone
or
anything
for
the
purpose
of
capturing
export
trade
but
only
so
long
as
it
did
not
punish
the
people
of
the
united
states.
in
the
senate,
senator
pomerene
pointedly
remarked
were
not
concerned
about
giving
to
the
foreign
consumer
a
minimum
price.
indeed,
the
ftc
report
from
which
the
act
is
from
emphasized
that
the
form
of
organization
permitted
must
not
operate
to
the
prejudice
of
the
american
public
reflecting
that
chauvinism
this
act
authorize
joint
activity
in
circumstance
where
the
resulting
non-competitive
price
would
be
borne
by
a
foreign
country
or
by
the
people
of
the
foreign
country.
but
the
act
in
its
legislative
history
make
it
clear
as
we
read
it
that
this
joint
activity
was
to
be
permitted
only
so
long
as
there
had
been
no
adverse
effect
upon
the
american
economy.
only
so
long
as
the
american
people
would
not
be
punished,
the
whole
purpose
of
the
act
points
out
we
think
an
exclusion
of
those
transactions
whereas
here
the
anticompetitive
conduct,
the
joint
activity
might
be
involved
would
be
at
the
expense
of
the
american
taxpayer.
congress
was
trying
to
strengthen
the
hand
of
the
american
exporter
to
be
sure
as
mr.
justice
white
said
but
the
export
trade
within
the
contemplation
of
the
act
in
our
view
was
the
traditional
export
trade
between
america
and
foreign
countries,
american
businesses
trying
to
get
business
and
foreign
countries
that
will
be
paid
for
by
foreign
sources
or
by
foreign
governments.
now,
there
are
powerful
reasons
we
think
in
addition
to
the
legislative
history
supporting
the
construction
that
we
advance
here.
the
webb-pomerene
act
is
an
exception
to
the
broad
mandate
of
the
antitrust
laws.
it's
a
familiar
principle
that
such
exceptions
are
to
be
narrowly
construed.
we
think
that
this
rule
requires
the
webb-pomerene
act
be
confined
to
its
underlying
purpose
and
not
given
the
expansive
construction
argued
for
here
by
the
appellees
which
would
involve
as
we
see
it
a
potential
burden
on
the
american
taxpayer.
we
think
also
that
the
history
of
government
procurement
points
the
same
direction
in
all
government
procurement;
it's
been
a
strong
policy
of
congress
that
there
should
be
no
interference
with
normal
competition.
we
think
that
when
the
taxpayers
are
paying
the
bill
as
they
are
inevitably
in
procurement
situations,
the
benefits
of
competition
should
be
available.
now,
mr.
justice
white
one
of
the
limitations
of
history
is
that
it
doesn't
tell
us
what
the
circumstances
would
be
under
a
different
set
of
assumptions,
rather
a
different
set
of
premises.
mr.
warren
christopher
i
think
the
assumption
that
congress
had
when
it
drafted
the
webb-pomerene
act
was
that
they
were
going
to
be
aiding
small
companies
in
getting
together
small
american
companies
in
getting
together
in
competing
in
the
world
market
but
i
think
it
was
an
equally
important
intention
of
the
congress
of
1918
that
they
should
not
permit
any
activity
which
would
be
at
the
expense
of
the
american
taxpayer
or
which
would
penalize
the
american
people.
now,
in
the
brief
of
the
appellees,
they
make
good
deal
of
the
point
that
the
aid
officials
invited
the
defendant
association
to
bid
and
that
is
certainly
a
fact
that
is
borne
out
by
the
stipulation.
mr.
warren
christopher
yes,
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
white
and
--
mr.
warren
christopher
--
as
to
that
i
would
only
say
that
procurement
officials
do
not
act
as
the
final
arbiters
of
the
antitrust
laws.
they
do
not
control
united
states
antitrust
policy
and
frequently
they
take
actions
which
in
the
long
run
turn
out
to
be
in
violation
of
antitrust
laws.
indeed,
the
only
other
time
that
this
court
i
think
has
written
an
opinion
on
the
webb-pomerene
area
and
the
alkali
export
association
case
in
325
u.s.,
this
court
made
it
clear
that
it
was
the
responsibility
of
the
department
of
justice
to
invoke
the
sherman
act
against
the
webb-pomerene
associations
when
the
associate
--
when
the
circumstances
were
appropriate.
perfectly
clear,
i
think
under
all
the
precedence
that
the
officials
at
aid
have
no
power
to
waive
or
suspend
the
provisions
of
the
sherman
act
no
matter
what
they
might
have
done
to
encourage
the
formation
of
webb-pomerene
associations
or
their
bidding
on
these
contracts.
neither
does
it
seem
to
me
to
be
persuasive
here
that
in
the
course
of
the
legislative
history,
there
are
indications
that
congress
was
aware
that
there
might
be
loans
to
foreign
governments
during
the
world
war
1
period
when
this
act
was
enacted
or
thereafter.
the
crucial
difference
is
that
the
loans
refer
to
in
that
portion
of
the
legislative
history
were
repayable
and
the
burden
of
noncompetitive
conduct,
the
burden
of
joint
activity
would
fall
on
the
foreign
governments
or
their
citizens
where
it
isn't
the
case
of
united
states
grants
which
has
been
the
familiar
pattern
under
aid.
the
burden
of
noncompetitive
conduct
falls
on
the
american
taxpayer.
it's
our
position
here
that
the
framers
of
the
act,
although
they
wanted
to
encourage
export
trade
and
wanted
to
encourage
small
business
in
the
united
states
to
get
together
to
compete
in
foreign
markets.
they
were
equally
clear
that
this
was
not
to
be
in
any
respect
at
the
expense
of
the
american
taxpayer.
now,
would
you
take
five
companies
as
large
as
these
companies
are,
i
think
one
might
not
unnaturally
think
that
if
they
were
competing
against
each
other
and
this
or
comparable
situations
that
a
lower
price
might
be
achieved
as
i
say
history
in
this
transaction
does
not
tell
us
that
but
the
whole
premise
of
our
antitrust
laws
is
that
competition
will
produce
lower
prices
and
it
is
those
lower
prices
of
that
competition
which
i
believe
the
framers
of
the
act
would
have
wanted
to
preserve
for
the
american
taxpayer
and
those
instances
where
there
is
federal
government
procurement.
mr.
warren
christopher
pardon
me?
mr.
warren
christopher
i'm
glad
to
do
so
mr.
justice
fortas.
there
might
be
two
possible
grounds
on
which
mootness
could
be
suggested
neither
of
them
persuasive
i
believe
sir.
first,
the
webb-pomerene
association
here
has
been
dissolved
but
it
is
a
familiar
rule
of
this
court
that
the
right
to
antitrust
relief
cannot
be
undercut
by
the
dissolution
of
an
association
or
corporation
during
the
course
of
litigation.
that
goes
back
to,
i
think
the
freight
association
case
in
166
u.s.
the
second
ground
on
which
on
which
mootness
might
be
suggested
is
that
on
january
1,
1967
the
aid
officials
adopted
a
regulation
forbidding
webb-pomerene
bidding
or
bidding
by
webb-pomerene
associations
and
know
his
instances
where
there
is
procurement
from
united
states
sources
only.
now
that's
a
limited
high
type
of
regulation.
it
would
not
in
terms
affect
this
case.
even
if
it
did
though
mr.
justice
fortas,
it
seems
to
us
that
the
fact
that
aid
could
change
that
regulation,
modify
and
go
back
to
its
own
rules,
makes
it
clear
that
this
case
is
not
moot
and
underscores
the
need
for
a
determination
here.
we're
seeking
a
statutory
determination
of
what
we
regard
as
a
very
important
underlying
question.
it's
a
reconciliation
of
two
important
statutes,
the
webb-pomerene
act
and
the
sherman
act,
the
determination
of
that
statutory
question
and
the
importance
of
it
has
not
been
diminished
by
anything
that's
transpired
and
for
the
reasons
i've
given,
i
believe
the
case
is
not
technically
moot.
mr.
chief
justice,
if
i
might
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time,
sir.
mr.
warren
christopher
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
wish
to
make
only
three
brief
points
in
concluding.
first,
the
government
believes
that
the
presence
or
absence
of
foreign
competition
is
not
the
determinative
factor
on
this
issue
of
statutory
construction.
the
foreign
competition
was
present
here
was
only
that
competition
which
was
permitted
by
aid.
as
paragraph
23
of
the
record
indicates,
page
49
of
the
stipulation,
the
only
foreign
purchasers
that
were
able
to
participate
in
the
bidding,
i'm
sorry,
the
only
foreign
companies
that
were
able
to
participate
in
bidding
were
those
in
countries
which
were
authorize
to
bid
under
the
aid
regulation.
basically,
aid
permitted
companies
in
the
underdeveloped
countries
and
the
less
developed
countries
to
bid
on
this
procurement.
i
think
this
demonstrates
very
well
how
irrelevant
the
presence
or
absence
of
foreign
competition
is
to
determination
of
the
statutory
issue.
aid
could
tomorrow
ban
all
foreign
competition
and
is
frequently
done
so
in
connection
with
its
procurement
or
its
supporting
of
foreign
countries
procurement.
in
a
situation
where
american
companies
had
a
monopoly
there
would
be
a
foreign
competition
at
all.
and
yet,
the
statutory
question
would
remain
the
same
so
i
think
we
would
say
that
the
procurement
agency
determines
the
extent
of
the
foreign
competition,
the
procurement
agency
is
able
to
determine
whether
or
not
it
wishes
on
a
given
procurement
to
permit
foreign
companies
to
participate
in
the
bidding
and
thus,
to
have
some
of
our
dollars
go
abroad
to
reflect
on
mr.
murphy's
concern
and
that
fact
the
extent
to
which
the
procurement
agency
permits
foreign
competition
is
i
say
should
not
and
cannot
be
controlling
on
the
matters
of
statutory
construction
involved
here.
second,
while
we
do
not
contend
that
there
was
any
fraud
on
behalf
of
the
--
around
part
of
the
defendant
appellees,
at
the
same
time
we
would
not
agree
that
there's
been
no
conceivable
injury
that
the
government
in
this
case.
the
record
shows
that
each
of
the
defendant
corporations
which
form
this
association
is
a
company
of
more
than
a
hundred
million
dollars
in
assets.
one
of
them
has
four
and
a
half
billion
dollars
in
assets.
to
suggest
that
if
they
were
bidding
against
each
other,
the
result
would
not
have
been
different
is
i
think
to
fail
to
look
at
the
realities
which
lie
behind
the
sherman
act.
four
of
the
five
companies
that
make
up
this
export
association
are
in
the
top
five
in
this
industry.
all
five
are
in
the
top
10
and
i
think
when
you
look
at
those
facts,
you
have
to
recognize
that
if
the
bidding
had
been
fully
competitive
of
the
american
taxpayer
it
had
the
advantage
of
having
american
companies
bidding
against
each
other.
it
might
have
had
a
different
result.
so
while
as
i
say,
we
do
not
charge
any
fraud
on
the
part
of
the
defendant
companies,
we
think
this
is
the
very
pure
question
of
statutory
interpretation
and
an
important
one.
nevertheless,
the
premise
of
the
antitrust
law
is
i
think
is
effective
here
to
indicate
that
there
should
be
bidding
for
the
full
competition
where
government
procurement
dollars
are
involved.
and
finally,
i
would
like
to
go
back
to
mr.
justice
fortas'
questions
and
the
points
he
has
been
making
because
i
believe
that
shows,
i
believe
they
illuminate
the
fact
that
the
form
of
this
transaction
should
not
be
controlling
here
but
rather,
what
should
be
controlling
is
that
this
is
government
procurement.
these
are
united
states
tax
dollars
and
they
ought
to
be
spent
under
circumstances
where
the
american
taxpayers
has
the
full
benefits
of
competition.
this
has
been
the
tradition
in
government
procurement.
this
should
be
followed
in
the
webb-pomerene
act
as
well.
mr.
warren
christopher
the
webb-pomerene
act,
mr.
justice
fortas,
provides
the
exemption
for
activities
done
in
the
course
of
export
trade.
it's
the
government's
contention
that
when
congress
used
those
terms,
it
was
referring
to
traditional
export
trade
where
american
businesses
sold
in
foreign
countries
to
foreign
purchasers
who
paid
from
foreign
funds.
we
think
that
legislative
history
makes
it
clear
that
congress
did
not
use
those
words
in
referring
to
or
to
refer
to
american
procurement.
mr.
warren
christopher
yes,
mr.
justice
i
believe
that
could
be
argued
that
the
proviso
taking
out
of
the
exclusion,
things
are
--
that
are
in
restraint
of
trade
within
the
united
states,
i
think
it
could
be
argued
that
that
proviso
might
be
effective
here
because
this
conduct
restrains
trade
in
american
procurement.
but
the
government
believes
that
the
sound
or
articulation
of
the
argument
is
that
the
history
of
the
act
and
the
intention
of
congress
excluded
government
procurement
from
the
concept
of
export
trade
that
they
were
trying
to
permit
companies
to
get
together
on.
thank
you
sir.
mr.
warren
christopher
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
civil
antitrust
case
which
comes
here
directly
from
the
southern
district
of
new
york.
the
court
below
dismissed
the
government's
complaint
which
had
charged
that
the
defendant's
activity
has
violated
section
1
of
the
sherman
act.
the
issue
presented
here
is
whether
or
not
the
antitrust
exemption
of
the
webb-pomerene
act
extends
to
the
procurement
of
goods
under
the
united
states
for
foreign
aid
program
where
the
goods
are
shipped
abroad
and
where
the
funds
to
pay
for
the
goods
come
from
the
united
states
treasury.
the
facts
are
all
stipulated
here
and
they're
not
in
dispute.
the
defendants
below
appellees
here
are
five
major
united
states
corporations
which
produce
concentrated
phosphate
and
the
export
association
which
they
formed
in
1961
and
which
is
called
the
concentrated
phosphate
export
association.
this
association
was
organized
in
order
to
enable
these
members
to
act
jointly
in
the
overseas
sales
of
phosphate
which
is
used
in
the
production
of
plant
food
or
fertilizer.
the
association
is
properly
registered
with
the
federal
trade
commission
under
the
webb-pomerene
act.
now,
the
board
of
directors
of
this
association
determines
the
prices
at
which
the
corporate
members
of
the
association
will
sell
their
phosphate
to
the
association
and
it
determines
the
prices
at
which
the
association
will
sell
the
phosphate
to
others.
in
addition,
the
board
of
directors
of
the
association
also
allocates
the
available
business
among
the
members
of
the
association.
transactions
here
on
issue
involved
some
43
million
dollars
in
sales
to
the
republic
of
korea
by
the
export
association.
these
sales
were
all
made
pursuant
to
our
united
states
foreign
aid
program.
indeed,
under
this
program,
the
united
states
through
aid,
the
agency
for
international
development
has
been
making
grants
to
korea
since
1953.
two
basic
methods
of
procurement
are
involved
in
this
case
in
two
of
the
transactions
which
are
before
the
court
involving
some
8
million
dollars.
the
procurement
was
handled
by
the
united
states
general
services
administration.
in
that
situation,
gsa
issued
a
standard
invitation
to
bid,
accepted
the
low
bid
on
behalf
of
the
united
states,
paid
the
association,
took
delivery
of
the
phosphate
and
arrange
for
it
shipment
to
korea.
in
nine
other
transactions
before
the
court
involving
some
35
million
dollars,
eight
authorize
the
office
of
supply
of
the
republic
of
korea
to
handle
the
procurement
of
the
phosphate.
each
face
of
this
transaction
however
was
rigidly
controlled
by
aid.
in
these
transactions,
the
phosphate
association
was
paid
by
united
states
bank
which
in
turn
received
its
funds
from
the
united
states
treasury.
whichever
method
of
procurement
was
followed,
either
through
gsa
or
through
the
office
of
supply
of
the
republic
of
korea,
aid
supervised
every
aspect
of
the
transaction.
until
final
delivery,
the
aid
--
aid
retained
the
right
to
divert
the
shipment.
as
indicated
above,
my
comments
in
both
cases,
the
funds
for
the
phosphate
came
from
the
united
states
treasury.
the
court
below
said,
aid
initiated
controlled,
directed,
and
financed
the
transactions
involved.
mr.
warren
christopher
yes
and
then
transshipped
to
korea.
mr.
warren
christopher
the
--
mr.
warren
christopher
gsa
did
take
the
--
mr.
warren
christopher
my
understanding
of
the
transaction
mr.
justice
fortas
is
that
the
goods,
the
phosphate
in
each
case
were
shipped
from
florida
to
korea
but
in
the
gsa
transaction,
gsa
actually
took
legal
control
of
the
goods
before
they
were
shipped
out
from
the
country.
on
the
other
hand,
the
government
makes
no
distinction
between
the
two
types
of
transactions.
we
think
we
do
not
argue
that
there
is
a
legal
difference
between
the
two
types
of
transactions.
mr.
warren
christopher
well,
mr.
justice
fortas,
we
think
the
crucial
fact
here
is
that
the
funds
came
from
the
united
states
treasury
and
that
the
transaction
was
controlled
in
every
respect
by
aid.
we
do
not
think
that
the
legal
steps
in
the
procurement
differed
significantly
to
make
the
legal
difference
between
the
gsa
procurement
and
the
republic
of
korea
procurement.
mr.
warren
christopher
yes,
sir
and
i
believe
the
stipulation
bears
that
out
mr.
justice.
mr.
warren
christopher
with
respect
to
the
other
transactions,
the
republic
of
korea
sought
the
bids
in
korea,
bids
were
made
there
and
the
phosphate
was
transferred
i
believe
from
the
export
association
to
the
korean
government
in
korea.
mr.
warren
christopher
no,
sir.
i
think
that
in
all
the
transactions
before
the
court,
all
11
of
the
transactions,
the
united
states
should
prevail
because
the
funds
came
from
united
states
treasury.
mr.
warren
christopher
well,
mr.
justice,
i
think
the
differences
between
the
two
types
of
procurement
are
not
significant
to
make
it
turn
on
those
factors
sir.
now,
under
the
stipulation,
korea
is
under
no
obligation
to
repay
the
funds
expanded
to
the
united
states.
however,
so
that
the
matter
is
fairly
before
the
court,
i
should
say
that
when
korea
sells
the
phosphate
to
private
purchasers
in
korea,
the
funds
generated
which
are
not
necessarily
equal
to
the
value
of
united
states
must
be
set
aside
as
counterpart
funds.
these
funds
have
been
used
in
practice
mostly
to
support
the
korean
defense
establishment
but
as
i
say,
the
stipulation
makes
clear
that
korea
is
under
no
obligation
to
repay
the
funds
expended
in
these
procurements.
in
1964,
the
united
states
filed
a
complaint
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york
charging
that
the
activities
of
this
association
constituted
illegal
price
fixing
and
an
allocation
of
business
in
violation
of
section
1
of
the
sherman
act.
the
court
below
dismissed
the
complaint
holding
that
the
transactions
were
within
the
web-pomerene
exemption.
in
the
view
of
the
court
below,
because
the
goods
were
shipped
to
a
foreign
country,
the
district
court
thought
they
constituted
export
trade
within
the
meaning
of
the
act.
however,
the
district
court
noted
in
its
opinion
that
it
seems
obviously
unfair
to
the
united
states
to
permit
the
defendants
to
charge
and
artificially
set
price
and
to
deprive
the
united
states
of
the
benefits
which
might
come
from
price
competition
between
the
association
notwithstanding
that
statement,
the
district
court
felt
that
the
exports
here
were
within
the
exception
--
exemption
of
the
webb-pomerene
act
and
therefore
held
that
the
government's
complaint
must
be
dismissed.
mr.
warren
christopher
mr.
justice
white,
there
was
competition
between
the
association
and
other
foreign
bidders
and
other
bidders
from
the
united
states.
mr.
warren
christopher
that's
correct
mr.
justice
white.
the
extent
of
them
can
be
indicated
from
the
fact
that
they
made
less
than
16%
of
the
bids
and
got
less
than
18%
of
the
business.
but
under
our
theory
of
the
case,
the
presence
of
foreign
competition
even
to
that
limited
degree
does
not
change
what
we
regard
as
the
proper
result
and
that
is
that
where
united
states
pays
the
bill
and
where
aid
supervises
the
transaction,
the
webb-pomerene
exemption
should
not
apply.
mr.
warren
christopher
that's
correct.
mr.
warren
christopher
well,
the
basic
purpose
of
the
act
was
to
enable
the
american
exporters
to
compete
in
foreign
markets
for
what
i
would
call
traditional
foreign
business
where
the
foreign
source
pays
the
money.
now
the
framers
of
the
act
were
very
careful
to
make
sure
that
there'll
be
no
injury
to
the
american
consumer,
to
the
american
taxpayer.
now,
i
think
it's
that
legislative
purpose
which
illuminates
the
act
and
which
makes
it
clear
here
that
where
uncle
sam
pays
the
bill
and
aids
and
supervises
the
transaction
that
the
exception
does
not
apply.
our
--
it
seems
to
me
that
as
we
look
at
the
webb-pomerene
act,
we
must
look
at
the
underlying
reasons,
we're
not
prisoner
of
the
dictionary
by
any
means,
i
think
our
obligation
is
to
look
at
the
history
and
purpose
of
congress.
as
just
indicated
in
my
comments
to
mr.
justice
white,
congress
was
trying
in
this
act
to
give
the
american
exporters
a
better
chance
to
compete
against
foreign
monopolies
especially
foreign
buying
cartels.
the
philosophy
of
the
act
was
united
states
business
is
it
should
be
freed
of
antitrust
restraints
and
their
approach
to
foreign
market.
congress
thought
it
was
acting
primarily
to
aid
small
companies
which
had
thought
could
not
compete
effectively
in
foreign
markets
unless
they
could
act
jointly.
now,
the
purpose
of
the
act
in
my
view
was
frankly
a
very
chauvinistic
one.
both
of
them
in
for
whom
the
act
is
named
emphasized
this
point.
in
the
house,
congressman
web
indicated
his
willingness
to
allow
a
combination
between
anyone
or
anything
for
the
purpose
of
capturing
export
trade
but
only
so
long
as
it
did
not
punish
the
people
of
the
united
states.
in
the
senate,
senator
pomerene
pointedly
remarked
were
not
concerned
about
giving
to
the
foreign
consumer
a
minimum
price.
indeed,
the
ftc
report
from
which
the
act
is
from
emphasized
that
the
form
of
organization
permitted
must
not
operate
to
the
prejudice
of
the
american
public
reflecting
that
chauvinism
this
act
authorize
joint
activity
in
circumstance
where
the
resulting
non-competitive
price
would
be
borne
by
a
foreign
country
or
by
the
people
of
the
foreign
country.
but
the
act
in
its
legislative
history
make
it
clear
as
we
read
it
that
this
joint
activity
was
to
be
permitted
only
so
long
as
there
had
been
no
adverse
effect
upon
the
american
economy.
only
so
long
as
the
american
people
would
not
be
punished,
the
whole
purpose
of
the
act
points
out
we
think
an
exclusion
of
those
transactions
whereas
here
the
anticompetitive
conduct,
the
joint
activity
might
be
involved
would
be
at
the
expense
of
the
american
taxpayer.
congress
was
trying
to
strengthen
the
hand
of
the
american
exporter
to
be
sure
as
mr.
justice
white
said
but
the
export
trade
within
the
contemplation
of
the
act
in
our
view
was
the
traditional
export
trade
between
america
and
foreign
countries,
american
businesses
trying
to
get
business
and
foreign
countries
that
will
be
paid
for
by
foreign
sources
or
by
foreign
governments.
now,
there
are
powerful
reasons
we
think
in
addition
to
the
legislative
history
supporting
the
construction
that
we
advance
here.
the
webb-pomerene
act
is
an
exception
to
the
broad
mandate
of
the
antitrust
laws.
it's
a
familiar
principle
that
such
exceptions
are
to
be
narrowly
construed.
we
think
that
this
rule
requires
the
webb-pomerene
act
be
confined
to
its
underlying
purpose
and
not
given
the
expansive
construction
argued
for
here
by
the
appellees
which
would
involve
as
we
see
it
a
potential
burden
on
the
american
taxpayer.
we
think
also
that
the
history
of
government
procurement
points
the
same
direction
in
all
government
procurement;
it's
been
a
strong
policy
of
congress
that
there
should
be
no
interference
with
normal
competition.
we
think
that
when
the
taxpayers
are
paying
the
bill
as
they
are
inevitably
in
procurement
situations,
the
benefits
of
competition
should
be
available.
now,
mr.
justice
white
one
of
the
limitations
of
history
is
that
it
doesn't
tell
us
what
the
circumstances
would
be
under
a
different
set
of
assumptions,
rather
a
different
set
of
premises.
mr.
warren
christopher
i
think
the
assumption
that
congress
had
when
it
drafted
the
webb-pomerene
act
was
that
they
were
going
to
be
aiding
small
companies
in
getting
together
small
american
companies
in
getting
together
in
competing
in
the
world
market
but
i
think
it
was
an
equally
important
intention
of
the
congress
of
1918
that
they
should
not
permit
any
activity
which
would
be
at
the
expense
of
the
american
taxpayer
or
which
would
penalize
the
american
people.
now,
in
the
brief
of
the
appellees,
they
make
good
deal
of
the
point
that
the
aid
officials
invited
the
defendant
association
to
bid
and
that
is
certainly
a
fact
that
is
borne
out
by
the
stipulation.
mr.
warren
christopher
yes,
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
white
and
--
mr.
warren
christopher
--
as
to
that
i
would
only
say
that
procurement
officials
do
not
act
as
the
final
arbiters
of
the
antitrust
laws.
they
do
not
control
united
states
antitrust
policy
and
frequently
they
take
actions
which
in
the
long
run
turn
out
to
be
in
violation
of
antitrust
laws.
indeed,
the
only
other
time
that
this
court
i
think
has
written
an
opinion
on
the
webb-pomerene
area
and
the
alkali
export
association
case
in
325
u.s.,
this
court
made
it
clear
that
it
was
the
responsibility
of
the
department
of
justice
to
invoke
the
sherman
act
against
the
webb-pomerene
associations
when
the
associate
--
when
the
circumstances
were
appropriate.
perfectly
clear,
i
think
under
all
the
precedence
that
the
officials
at
aid
have
no
power
to
waive
or
suspend
the
provisions
of
the
sherman
act
no
matter
what
they
might
have
done
to
encourage
the
formation
of
webb-pomerene
associations
or
their
bidding
on
these
contracts.
neither
does
it
seem
to
me
to
be
persuasive
here
that
in
the
course
of
the
legislative
history,
there
are
indications
that
congress
was
aware
that
there
might
be
loans
to
foreign
governments
during
the
world
war
1
period
when
this
act
was
enacted
or
thereafter.
the
crucial
difference
is
that
the
loans
refer
to
in
that
portion
of
the
legislative
history
were
repayable
and
the
burden
of
noncompetitive
conduct,
the
burden
of
joint
activity
would
fall
on
the
foreign
governments
or
their
citizens
where
it
isn't
the
case
of
united
states
grants
which
has
been
the
familiar
pattern
under
aid.
the
burden
of
noncompetitive
conduct
falls
on
the
american
taxpayer.
it's
our
position
here
that
the
framers
of
the
act,
although
they
wanted
to
encourage
export
trade
and
wanted
to
encourage
small
business
in
the
united
states
to
get
together
to
compete
in
foreign
markets.
they
were
equally
clear
that
this
was
not
to
be
in
any
respect
at
the
expense
of
the
american
taxpayer.
now,
would
you
take
five
companies
as
large
as
these
companies
are,
i
think
one
might
not
unnaturally
think
that
if
they
were
competing
against
each
other
and
this
or
comparable
situations
that
a
lower
price
might
be
achieved
as
i
say
history
in
this
transaction
does
not
tell
us
that
but
the
whole
premise
of
our
antitrust
laws
is
that
competition
will
produce
lower
prices
and
it
is
those
lower
prices
of
that
competition
which
i
believe
the
framers
of
the
act
would
have
wanted
to
preserve
for
the
american
taxpayer
and
those
instances
where
there
is
federal
government
procurement.
mr.
warren
christopher
pardon
me?
mr.
warren
christopher
i'm
glad
to
do
so
mr.
justice
fortas.
there
might
be
two
possible
grounds
on
which
mootness
could
be
suggested
neither
of
them
persuasive
i
believe
sir.
first,
the
webb-pomerene
association
here
has
been
dissolved
but
it
is
a
familiar
rule
of
this
court
that
the
right
to
antitrust
relief
cannot
be
undercut
by
the
dissolution
of
an
association
or
corporation
during
the
course
of
litigation.
that
goes
back
to,
i
think
the
freight
association
case
in
166
u.s.
the
second
ground
on
which
on
which
mootness
might
be
suggested
is
that
on
january
1,
1967
the
aid
officials
adopted
a
regulation
forbidding
webb-pomerene
bidding
or
bidding
by
webb-pomerene
associations
and
know
his
instances
where
there
is
procurement
from
united
states
sources
only.
now
that's
a
limited
high
type
of
regulation.
it
would
not
in
terms
affect
this
case.
even
if
it
did
though
mr.
justice
fortas,
it
seems
to
us
that
the
fact
that
aid
could
change
that
regulation,
modify
and
go
back
to
its
own
rules,
makes
it
clear
that
this
case
is
not
moot
and
underscores
the
need
for
a
determination
here.
we're
seeking
a
statutory
determination
of
what
we
regard
as
a
very
important
underlying
question.
it's
a
reconciliation
of
two
important
statutes,
the
webb-pomerene
act
and
the
sherman
act,
the
determination
of
that
statutory
question
and
the
importance
of
it
has
not
been
diminished
by
anything
that's
transpired
and
for
the
reasons
i've
given,
i
believe
the
case
is
not
technically
moot.
mr.
chief
justice,
if
i
might
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time,
sir.
mr.
warren
christopher
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
wish
to
make
only
three
brief
points
in
concluding.
first,
the
government
believes
that
the
presence
or
absence
of
foreign
competition
is
not
the
determinative
factor
on
this
issue
of
statutory
construction.
the
foreign
competition
was
present
here
was
only
that
competition
which
was
permitted
by
aid.
as
paragraph
23
of
the
record
indicates,
page
49
of
the
stipulation,
the
only
foreign
purchasers
that
were
able
to
participate
in
the
bidding,
i'm
sorry,
the
only
foreign
companies
that
were
able
to
participate
in
bidding
were
those
in
countries
which
were
authorize
to
bid
under
the
aid
regulation.
basically,
aid
permitted
companies
in
the
underdeveloped
countries
and
the
less
developed
countries
to
bid
on
this
procurement.
i
think
this
demonstrates
very
well
how
irrelevant
the
presence
or
absence
of
foreign
competition
is
to
determination
of
the
statutory
issue.
aid
could
tomorrow
ban
all
foreign
competition
and
is
frequently
done
so
in
connection
with
its
procurement
or
its
supporting
of
foreign
countries
procurement.
in
a
situation
where
american
companies
had
a
monopoly
there
would
be
a
foreign
competition
at
all.
and
yet,
the
statutory
question
would
remain
the
same
so
i
think
we
would
say
that
the
procurement
agency
determines
the
extent
of
the
foreign
competition,
the
procurement
agency
is
able
to
determine
whether
or
not
it
wishes
on
a
given
procurement
to
permit
foreign
companies
to
participate
in
the
bidding
and
thus,
to
have
some
of
our
dollars
go
abroad
to
reflect
on
mr.
murphy's
concern
and
that
fact
the
extent
to
which
the
procurement
agency
permits
foreign
competition
is
i
say
should
not
and
cannot
be
controlling
on
the
matters
of
statutory
construction
involved
here.
second,
while
we
do
not
contend
that
there
was
any
fraud
on
behalf
of
the
--
around
part
of
the
defendant
appellees,
at
the
same
time
we
would
not
agree
that
there's
been
no
conceivable
injury
that
the
government
in
this
case.
the
record
shows
that
each
of
the
defendant
corporations
which
form
this
association
is
a
company
of
more
than
a
hundred
million
dollars
in
assets.
one
of
them
has
four
and
a
half
billion
dollars
in
assets.
to
suggest
that
if
they
were
bidding
against
each
other,
the
result
would
not
have
been
different
is
i
think
to
fail
to
look
at
the
realities
which
lie
behind
the
sherman
act.
four
of
the
five
companies
that
make
up
this
export
association
are
in
the
top
five
in
this
industry.
all
five
are
in
the
top
10
and
i
think
when
you
look
at
those
facts,
you
have
to
recognize
that
if
the
bidding
had
been
fully
competitive
of
the
american
taxpayer
it
had
the
advantage
of
having
american
companies
bidding
against
each
other.
it
might
have
had
a
different
result.
so
while
as
i
say,
we
do
not
charge
any
fraud
on
the
part
of
the
defendant
companies,
we
think
this
is
the
very
pure
question
of
statutory
interpretation
and
an
important
one.
nevertheless,
the
premise
of
the
antitrust
law
is
i
think
is
effective
here
to
indicate
that
there
should
be
bidding
for
the
full
competition
where
government
procurement
dollars
are
involved.
and
finally,
i
would
like
to
go
back
to
mr.
justice
fortas'
questions
and
the
points
he
has
been
making
because
i
believe
that
shows,
i
believe
they
illuminate
the
fact
that
the
form
of
this
transaction
should
not
be
controlling
here
but
rather,
what
should
be
controlling
is
that
this
is
government
procurement.
these
are
united
states
tax
dollars
and
they
ought
to
be
spent
under
circumstances
where
the
american
taxpayers
has
the
full
benefits
of
competition.
this
has
been
the
tradition
in
government
procurement.
this
should
be
followed
in
the
webb-pomerene
act
as
well.
mr.
warren
christopher
the
webb-pomerene
act,
mr.
justice
fortas,
provides
the
exemption
for
activities
done
in
the
course
of
export
trade.
it's
the
government's
contention
that
when
congress
used
those
terms,
it
was
referring
to
traditional
export
trade
where
american
businesses
sold
in
foreign
countries
to
foreign
purchasers
who
paid
from
foreign
funds.
we
think
that
legislative
history
makes
it
clear
that
congress
did
not
use
those
words
in
referring
to
or
to
refer
to
american
procurement.
mr.
warren
christopher
yes,
mr.
justice
i
believe
that
could
be
argued
that
the
proviso
taking
out
of
the
exclusion,
things
are
--
that
are
in
restraint
of
trade
within
the
united
states,
i
think
it
could
be
argued
that
that
proviso
might
be
effective
here
because
this
conduct
restrains
trade
in
american
procurement.
but
the
government
believes
that
the
sound
or
articulation
of
the
argument
is
that
the
history
of
the
act
and
the
intention
of
congress
excluded
government
procurement
from
the
concept
of
export
trade
that
they
were
trying
to
permit
companies
to
get
together
on.
thank
you
sir.
