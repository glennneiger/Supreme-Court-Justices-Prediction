justice

fortas
mr.
christopher,
i
may
have
missed
you
when
you're
talking
about
the
two
transactions
in
which
gsa
did
the
procurement
directly.
did
you
say
that
gsa
took
delivery?
justice
abe
fortas
oh!
what's
the
basis
of
that
statement?
did
gsa
take
--
it
didn't
take
physical
delivery,
did
it?
justice
abe
fortas
it
just
what
happened
there.
justice
abe
fortas
forgive
me
for
interrupting
here
but
i
--
to
me
the
importance,
i'm
troubles
by
the
mootness
point
in
this
case
and
that
has
an
important
--
may
have
an
important
bearing.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
if
you
--
i
see
you
place
no
emphasis
upon
the
possibility
that
the
g
--
if
gsa
did
take
delivery
on
those
two
transactions.
there
may
be
a
difference
in
terms
of
the
issues
on
this
case
which
you
--
there
is
such
a
difference
you'd
like
to
waiver
is
that
it?
justice
abe
fortas
do
you
contend
in
the
two
cases
that
gsa
took
delivery
in
other
words
that
so
far
as
i
am
concerned
the
contract
was
completely
performed
within
the
united
states?
justice
abe
fortas
but,
with
respect
to
the
other
transactions,
delivery
was
not
effective
until
the
phosphate
arrived
in
the
republic
of
korea,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
but
you
--
you
nevertheless
make
no
point
about
that
difference?
justice
abe
fortas
but
if
you
don't
prevail
in
the
rok
transactions
and
you
don't
care
about
prevailing
in
the
other
two.
justice
abe
fortas
are
you
going
to
address
yourself
to
the
mootness
problem,
mr.
christopher?
justice
abe
fortas
are
you
going
to
address
yourself
to
the
mootness
problem?
justice
abe
fortas
you
may
do
so.
mr.
murphy.
justice
abe
fortas
under
the
webb-pomerene
act
if
this
were,
if
the
sale
in
question
were
sale
to
the
united
states
and
paid
for
by
the
united
states
and
then
the
merchandise
were
shipped
by
the
united
states
out
of
this
country.
would
it
be
--
would
the
transaction
have
the
benefit
of
the
sherman
act
exemption
and
antitrust
exemption?
justice
abe
fortas
you
mean,
that
that
might
not
be
--
that
transaction
might
not
be
entitled
to
the
antitrust
exemption?
justice
abe
fortas
and
suppose
that
the
united
--
same
facts
that
i
gave
you
before
in
the
united
states
instead
of
sending
it
abroad
for
use
by
the
united
states,
send
it
abroad
for
use
by
another
country.
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
what
you're
relying
on
here
are
two
facts
perhaps.
one,
that
the
purchases
were
made
and
with
possible
exception
of
the
two
transactions
purchases
were
made
by
an
agency
of
the
republic
of
korea.
and
two,
although
they
were
turned
over
to
the
republic
of
korea,
although
the
merchandise
has
turned
over
to
the
republic
of
korea
it
was
intended
for
resale
there.
are
those
the
two
points
on
which
you
rely
to
distinguish
this
from
the
last
case
i
put
through?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
would
you
agree
that
theoretical
matter
if
the
procurement
were
by
the
united
states
for
used
by
the
united
states
abroad,
in
fact
that
there
would
be
foreign
competition
would
not
put
the
transaction
under
the
antitrust
exemption
umbrella
of
the
webb-pomerene
act?
justice
abe
fortas
do
you
think
that
if
there
is
foreign
competition
that
that
fact
standing
alone
entered
to
the
export
of
the
goods
of
course
makes
it
a
webb-pomerene
transaction
perhaps
as
an
antitrust
exemption.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
how
about
maybe
--
the
problem
i
think
is
a
problem
of
statutory
construction
application
here
and
the
united
states
--
sales
to
the
united
states
are
not
expressly
outside
of
the
coverage
of
the
antitrust
exemption
under
webb-pomerene
act.
but
do
i
understand
that
you
agree
that
there
are
outside
of
that
exemption
on
the
basis
of
the
doctrine
that
sovereign
is
excluded
unless
specifically
--
unless
otherwise
specifically
provided?
justice
abe
fortas
so,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
question
here
that
at
least
threshold
question
is
whether
the
various
functions
performed
by
the
united
states
in
these
transactions
convert
this
into
in
effect
a
sale
to
the
united
states
by
this
association.
if
it
is
considered
a
sale
to
the
united
states,
it
may
be
some
other
questions
to
be
answered
but
at
least
to
that
extent,
you
take
it
out
of
the
webb-pomerene
exemption
and
you
may,
then
i
think
you
would
say,
you
want
to
find
out
what
the
united
states
does
sale.
what's
your
comment
on
that?
unfortunately
compound
question
of
mine.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
why
is
that?
justice
abe
fortas
even,
even
though,
so
you
think
that
the
united
states,
the
united
states,
sovereign
united
states
is
deprived
of
the
--
is
affected
by
the
antitrust
exemption
in
the
webb-pomerene
act
depending
upon
what
the
united
states
does
with
the
merchandise?
justice
abe
fortas
but
i'm
not
sure
that
it
isn't.
where
do
you
get
--
what's
the
basis
of
your
agreement
or
your
statement
that
a
sale
to
the
united
states
for
consumption
by
the
united
states
in
some
foreign
country
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
is
not
covered
by
the
antitrust
exemption?
what's
the
basis
of
that?
how
do
you
arrive
at
that?
justice
abe
fortas
that's
right.
justice
abe
fortas
i
know
but
gsa
is
the
united
states
too.
justice
abe
fortas
what's
the
basis
for
excluding
the
sales
to
the
united
states
from
antitrust
exemption?
justice
abe
fortas
in
other
words,
it's
not,
you're
not
relying
on
any
expressed
provision
on
the
statute
but
by
implication
derived
from
the
fact
that
the
united
states
has
a
sovereign
in
that
doctrine
and
the
legislative
history?
