mr.
samuel
w.
murphy,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
if
the
court
please.
i
think
we
would
differ
a
bit
with
to
the
deputy
attorney
general
in
stating
the
question
presented
on
this
appeal.
we
would
state
the
question
as
being
whether
aid
finance
export
sales
made
in
competition
with
foreign
producers.
this
export
trade,
as
those
words
are
used
in
the
webb
act,
it
seems
to
us
of
considerable
importance
on
the
stipulated
facts
of
this
record.
importance
both
in
terms
of
the
general
significance
of
the
case
to
the
propositions
the
government
is
putting
forward
and
the
importance
in
terms
of
the
outcome
of
the
case
that
there
was
active
foreign
competition
here
in
each
of
the
transactions
challenged
by
the
government
with
one
exception,
that
one
exception
being
a
transaction
on
which
the
defendants
received
no
award
of
the
business.
in
the
webb-pomerene
act
in
defining
export
trade,
congress
went
to
particular
care
to
outline
first
what
export
trade
was
to
be
covered
by
the
immunity
of
the
webb-act
defining
it
in
terms
of
the
export
of
goods
from
this
country
to
another.
it
also
defined
export
trade
in
terms
of
what
it
is
not.
it
is
not
production.
it
is
not
manufactured.
and
it
is
not
sale
within
the
united
states
for
resale
or
consumption
here.
in
addition,
congress
attached
a
series
of
provisos
in
which
it
was
stated
that
even
no
one
act
might
be
within
export
trade
as
literally
defined.
it
would
nevertheless
be
subject
to
the
sherman
act
prohibitions
if
it
resulted
in
any
effect,
artificial
or
intentional
effect
on
prices
on
the
united
states,
any
restraint
of
the
export
trade
of
domestic
competitors
on
the
association
or
any
restraint
of
trade
in
the
united
states.
this
is
a
stipulated
record.
it
is
stipulated
here
that
the
goods
sold
by
the
defendants
were
exported
from
this
country,
not
only
to
korea
but
to
38
other
countries.
it
is
stipulated
that
the
defendants
met
all
of
the
requirements
of
the
webb-pomerene
act.
now,
it
is
conceded
that
they
did
not
violate
any
of
its
provisos.
consequently
that
being
so,
it
seems
to
us
that
the
ultimate
question
presented
to
this
court
by
this
appeal
is
whether
the
transaction
is
challenged
by
the
government
were
so
radically
different
from
anything
that
congress
might
have
had
in
mind
in
1918.
as
to
justify
or
require
a
departure
from
the
otherwise
pretty
plain
english
of
that
law.
mr.
samuel
w.
murphy,
jr.
i
think
a
practical
sense,
justice
fortas,
that
would
depend
on
other
facts
not
in
your
question.
our
position
is
that
as
a
general
proposition,
the
test
of
whether
the
webb
act
applies
is
the
ultimate
and
intended
destination
of
the
goods.
but
i
would
believe
that
in
the
case
where
the
sale
were
to
the
united
states
and
for
used
by
the
united
states,
some
place
out
that
one
of
the
provisos
attached
by
the
act
might
well
come
into
play
dependent
on
the
facts
of
the
situation.
mr.
samuel
w.
murphy,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
samuel
w.
murphy,
jr.
i
think
that
that
transaction
given
only
those
facts
would
be
entitled
to
the
exemption
of
the
webb
act
by
the
test
that
congress
has
laid
down.
mr.
samuel
w.
murphy,
jr.
we
also
rely
very
heavily
justice
fortas
on
the
presence
of
foreign
competition.
there's
just
no
question
that
the
webb-pomerene
act
was
designed
basically
to
encourage
american
companies
to
participate
more
extensively
in
export
trade
by
allowing
them
to
collaborate
not
only
for
the
purposes
suggested
by
the
government
but
also
for
the
purposes
of
reducing
cost
and
mastering
greater
resources.
mr.
samuel
w.
murphy,
jr.
no,
i
don't
believe
i
would
agree
with
that
justice
fortas.
mr.
samuel
w.
murphy,
jr.
i
wouldn't
agree
that
that
fact
standing
alone
is
determinative
but
it
seems
to
me
certainly
one
of
the
most
significant
facts.
in
our
case,
as
i
understand
it,
the
government's
position
comes
down
solely
that
a
proposition
that
there
was
injury
to
the
united
states.
an
injury
which
they
presumed
as
i
understand
there
case
from
applying
to
the
sales
of
this
webb-pomerene
association,
sherman
act
principles
to
which
congress
has
said
are
not
to
apply
so
long
as
that
association
is
engaged
in
export
trade
and
that
seems
to
us
a
peculiar
avenue
along
which
to
approach
the
question
of
whether
this
was
export
trade.
but
even
if
you
start
down
that
avenue
at
a
reason
why
we
emphasize
foreign
competition
here,
even
if
you
start
down
that
avenue,
it
is
our
further
position
that
you
find
no
injury,
no
injury
in
fact.
now,
mr.
christopher
has
emphasize
that
in
his
argument
and
the
government
has
in
its
brief
the
point
that
the
republic
of
korea
bought
concentrated
phosphates
in
this
particular
transactions
using
grant
funds
and
that
therefore
there
was
a
burden
on
the
united
states.
i
suggest
the
burden
is
far
greater
where
a
foreign
competitor
wins
an
award
of
that
business
because
that's
foreign
competitor
was
just
as
eligible
as
where
this
defendants
to
be
paid
an
aid
dollars.
and
every
aid
dollar
paid
to
a
supplier
from
tunisia
on
account
of
his
sale
to
the
republic
of
korea
was
a
dollar
that
was
gone
from
the
united
states.
whereas
every
dollar
that
these
defendants
obtained
in
this
korean
market
as
was
true
with
the
dollars
it
obtained
in
selling
in
30
(a)
other
markets
was
a
dollar
kept
in
the
united
states
and
to
that
extent
on
the
facts
of
this
case
it
seemed
to
me
if
there
is
a
physical
burden
of
any
kind
we
help
to
reduce
it.
mr.
samuel
w.
murphy,
jr.
i
believe
he
used
the
figure
about
16%.
mr.
samuel
w.
murphy,
jr.
i
was
not
clear.
there
were
13
transactions
with
korea.
mr.
samuel
w.
murphy,
jr.
two
of
which
are
not
challenged
in
this
case
justice
white.
mr.
samuel
w.
murphy,
jr.
quite
so
and
it
won
awards
in
the
most
(voice
overlap).
mr.
samuel
w.
murphy,
jr.
absolutely.
mr.
samuel
w.
murphy,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
if
the
court
please,
i
should
like
to
return
briefly
to
two
questions
as
just
before
the
recess.
mr.
justice
fortas
asked
the
question
of
where
delivery
was
made
on
the
two
transactions
in
which
gsa
participated.
according
to
the
agreement,
justice
fortas,
between
gsa
and
aid
and
the
pertinent
part
is
printed
at
page
288
of
the
appendix,
delivery
was
to
be
made
to
aid
or
to
its
designee
which
in
this
case
was
the
republic
of
korea
and
the
papers
on
one
of
those
transactions
which
are
printed
in
the
appendix
beginning
at
page
293
shows
that
in
that
transaction
delivery
of
the
commodities
was
made
to
a
vessel
in
a
florida
port
consigned
to
the
republic
of
korea.
as
to
the
questions
of
justice
white
about
this
excessive
foreign
producers
on
these
transactions
which
i'm
not
sure
i
answered
too
clearly.
of
the
11
korean
procurements
financed
by
the
agency
for
international
development,
foreign
producers
won
18%
of
the
total
amount
of
business
awarded
on
11
transactions.
just
before
the
recess,
i
was
saying
--
mr.
samuel
w.
murphy,
jr.
sir?
mr.
samuel
w.
murphy,
jr.
korea
awarded
--
mr.
samuel
w.
murphy,
jr.
well,
korea
invited
tenders
on
and
awarded
very
substantial
tonnages
and
a
particular
bidder
would
also
make
a
variety
of
bids
depending
on
delivery
time,
different
prices
for
different
quantities,
different
delivery
periods
and
in
many
of
these
transactions,
the
awards
were
split
so
much
to
these
defendants
and
so
much
to
another
american
supplier,
so
much
to
a
foreign
producer.
mr.
samuel
w.
murphy,
jr.
oh!
no
question
about
that.
now
before
getting
back
into
the
facts
which
at
least
as
we
view
of
them
showed
that
these
who
are
not
totally
different
transactions
from
the
kind
--
congress
contemplated,
i
would
also
like
to
note
in
passing
that
the
congress
which
enacted
the
webb-pomerene
act
in
1917
and
1918
was
itself
very
busy
in
foreign
aid.
it
was
during
that
period
that
congress
was
authorizing
and
appropriating
very
considerable
sums
of
money
for
foreign
assistance
programs.
so
that
certainly
congress
had
within
its
general
contemplation
in
adopting
the
webb
act
that
export
trade
associations
would
trade
in
foreign
markets
that
were
supported
in
united
states
that
recognition
was
expressed
during
the
debates
prior
to
passage
of
the
act
and
at
the
end
of
world
war
1
and
immediately
thereafter,
export
trade
associations
did
sell
at
that
time
to
european
customers
who
were
totally
dependent
on
the
financial
assistance
of
the
united
states.
export
trade
associations
have
continued
to
make
those
sales
from
time
to
time
during
the
50
years
since
the
act
was
passed.
during
war
time
and
post-war
period
in
the
land
lease
program
as
it
stipulated
in
various
of
the
modern
foreign
aid
programs.
during
that
same
period,
the
congress
has
regularly
reviewed
the
foreign
assistance
programs
and
has
frequently
reviewed
the
webb
act
and
has
never
at
anytime
suggested
that
it
intended
in
anyway
in
adopting
the
modern
foreign
assistance
programs
to
roll
back
the
webb
act
as
the
government
now
acts.
now,
mr.
christopher
referred
to
a
sentence
in
judge
ryan's
opinion
below
which
does
seem
to
me
a
good
way
to
get
into
a
more
detailed
discussion
as
some
of
the
facts
here
in
which
judge
ryan
and
i
am
referring
to
page
362,
the
joint
appendix
says
it
seems
obviously
unfair
to
the
united
states
in
describing
the
situation
in
which
webb
associations
sell
the
foreign
aid
finance
customer.
it's
quite
clear
to
us
that
judge
ryan
in
that
sentence
was
describing
the
government's
argument.
he
says,
herein
is
the
core
of
the
government's
argument.
we
cannot
say
that
it
does
not
have
appeal
and
then
follows
the
sentence
that
mr.
christopher
referred
to.
but
judge
ryan
then
goes
on
in
the
balance
of
his
opinion
to
set
forth
his
conclusions.
as
to
why
the
government's
position
why
the
superficial
appeal
of
unfairness
in
the
government's
position
is
simply
not
so
as
a
matter
of
fact.
now,
in
this
particular
case,
we
rely
quite
heavily
on
the
aspect
of
foreign
competition
as
meeting
any
suggestion
of
fairness
--
unfairness
as
well
as
two
other
aspects
of
the
case.
first,
the
full
disclosure
to
and
yet
encouragement
by
officials
of
both
the
korean
and
united
states
government
of
the
defendant's
participation
in
a
finance
business;
and
secondly,
the
facts,
the
stipulated
facts
which
is
we
view
and
i'm
quite
clearly
demonstrate
that
there
was
no
injury
here
to
united
states
as
a
matter
of
fact.
now,
these
defendants
and
their
association
registered
with
the
federal
trade
commission,
there's
no
question
about
that,
observed
all
of
formal
requirements
of
the
webb
act.
they
did
what
congress
intended
where
the
associations
to
do.
the
association
went
out
and
sold
american
produced
phosphates
wherever
it
could
find
or
create
demand
all
over
the
world
in
38
countries
in
addition
to
korea,
although
korea
was
the
single
most
important
consumer
or
purchaser
of
these
association's
products.
at
all
times,
it
is
stipulated
aid,
gsa,
and
the
office
of
supply
of
the
republic
of
korea,
knew
what
the
defendants
were,
knew
how
they
did
do
business
and
at
all
times,
all
of
our
bids
to
korea
were
made
in
response
to
formal
invitations
in
competitive
public
bidding
procedures.
now,
we
don't
suggest
that
those
facts
themselves
give
rise
to
any
kind
of
an
antitrust
immunity
and
we
don't
suggest
that
aid's
regulations
and
activities
take
the
place
of
either
the
webb
act
on
the
one
hand
or
the
sherman
act
on
the
other.
but
they
are
facts
which
do
seem
to
us
to
be
quite
significant
as
they
relate
to
the
threat
running
through
the
government's
case
suggesting
unfairness
on
our
part
and
perhaps
even
more
importantly,
we
believe
that
they
are
significant
to
the
question
of
injury.
had
aid
officials
believed
that
their
program
was
being
in
any
way
burdened
by
the
activities
of
these
defendants,
in
any
way
injured
or
frustrated
as
the
government
has
suggested
by
these
defendants.
i
think
it's
unreasonable
to
conclude
that
they
would
nevertheless
have
solicited
bids
from
us.
when
aid
clearly
did
possess
the
authority
which
it
exercised
on
january
1,
1967
they
shot
webb
act
associations
out
of
aid
finance
markets.
now,
a
second
important
fact
is
this
factor
foreign
competition
which
is
already
been
covered
quite
thoroughly
and
that
brings
me
to
what
i
think
is
the
quite
clear
fact
that
there
is
just
no
evidence
in
this
stipulated
record
that
there
was
any
injury
of
any
kind.
that
there
was
any
burden
of
any
kind
on
the
united
states
any
harm
either
that
korea
or
to
the
united
states
foreign
aid
program
and
this
is
a
stipulated
record.
during
the
hearing
below
before
judge
ryan
which
took
the
place
of
a
full
trial,
he
probed
quite
carefully
into
this
question
and
in
response
to
his
questions,
the
government's
counsel
conceded
there
was
no
suggestion
here
by
the
government
that
the
defendant
or
their
association
had
in
any
way
overcharged
either
aid
or
korea,
or
had
engaged
in
any
way
in
any
unfair,
unreasonable
or
discriminatory
price.
there
is
never
been
any
suggestion
in
this
case
of
any
damage,
any
injury,
any
burden,
any
unfairness.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
only
injury
that
is
set
to
flow
here
flows
from
applying
to
business
activities
which
are
exempt
from
the
sherman
act,
principles
that
would
apply
only
if
the
exemption
were
lost.
now,
not
only
is
there
no
injury
but
if
the
court
please,
we
think
the
record
is
quite
clear
that
the
evidence
relating
to
that
question
is
quite
to
the
contrary.
mr.
samuel
w.
murphy,
jr.
well,
i
haven't
thought
about
that
on
that
basis,
justice
fortas
but
i
do
agree
that
a
sale
to
the
untied
states
for
consumption
by
the
united
states
is
not
included.
mr.
samuel
w.
murphy,
jr.
i
would
begin
by
saying
that
that
i
do
not
agree
that
a
sale
of
commodities
to
the
united
states
which
commodities
the
united
states
then
gives
away
to
a
foreign
consumer
is
outside
the
webb
exemption.
i
think
that
is
within
the
webb
exemption.
mr.
samuel
w.
murphy,
jr.
within
the
webb
act,
yes
sir.
mr.
samuel
w.
murphy,
jr.
that's
correct.
that
that
is
export
trade
as
the
webb
act
defines
it.
mr.
samuel
w.
murphy,
jr.
well,
quite
frankly,
justice
fortas,
i
am
unable
to
answer
the
sovereign
--
the
sovereignty
aspects
of
your
question
and
i
do
not
think
that
this
is
a
position
that
we
have
to
defend
in
this
case
that
it
is
--
mr.
samuel
w.
murphy,
jr.
yes.
mr.
samuel
w.
murphy,
jr.
i
must
have
misunderstood
your
questions
justice
fortas
but
my
position
would
be
and
is
that
congress
set
out
a
clear
test
in
using
the
word
"export"
in
that
same
sense
that
it
had
become
settled
in
the
law
by
that
the
sense
of
its
ultimate
resting
place.
i
believe
that
i
responded
to
your
similar
question
before
the
recess
justice
fortas
by
saying
that
in
my
view,
on
the
facts
you
post
that
is
a
government
purchase
and
government
consumption
abroad.
mr.
samuel
w.
murphy,
jr.
that
the
provisos
would
come
into
play
and
depending
on
the
facts
and
the
situation,
it
would
be
found
that
there
was
a
kind
of
effect
on
domestic
commerce
which
the
act,
the
webb
act
proscribes.
but
in
this
case,
it
has
been
stipulated
that
the
united
states
was
not
the
purchaser
on
page
49
of
the
appendix
in
our
stipulation
it
states
aid
did
not
itself
procure
any
concentrated
phosphates
for
korean
and
the
record
is
replete
with
the
fact
--
mr.
samuel
w.
murphy,
jr.
well,
the
government
as
i
understand
it
attributes
no
significance
to
the
difference
and
in
our
view
gsa's
participation
did
not
order
the
substance
of
the
transactions
at
all.
now,
mr.
christopher
has
suggested
that
this
is
a
very
significant
case
in
which
the
government
needs
a
broad
ruling
which
brings
one
naturally
to
the
question
justice
fortas
also
raised
this
warning
about
mootness.
in
the
first
instance,
we
would
emphasize
that
narrowness
of
this
case
stipulated
record
the
fact
that
it
relates
to
aid
finance
only
to
aid
finance
markets
in
which
there
is
foreign
competition.
the
emphasis
placed
in
the
case
by
the
government
on
the
fact
that
korea
used
grand
rather
than
loan
aid
whereas
at
the
present
time,
grants
form
a
relatively
small
part
of
total
foreign
aid.
now,
finally,
the
whatever
significance
this
narrow
case
had
was
pretty
well
sucked
out
of
it
when
effective
january
1,
1967
aid
adopted
a
regulation
which
went
directly
to
the
question
of
the
extent
to
which
webb
associations
can
deal
and
aid
finance
markets
by
providing
that
such
associations
would
not
be
eligible
to
bid
unless
foreign
suppliers
were
also
eligible
to
bid.
the
practical
consequence
of
that
regulation
was
to
put
this
association
out
of
business.
the
association
seized
all
operations
in
june
of
1967,
has
made
no
sales
since
then,
and
the
association
was
formally
dissolved
and
entirely
abandoned
at
the
end
of
last
year.
the
government's
case
it
seems
to
us
comes
down
to
a
policy
argument
that
is
somehow
a
bad
thing
to
allow
export
associations
to
sell
to
foreign
customers
being
finance
to
the
united
states
government.
we
suggest
that
that
is
an
argument
better
addressed
to
the
congress
and
to
this
court
and
that
in
any
event,
the
narrow
nature
and
now
the
dead
nature
of
this
case
will
not
support
the
weight
of
that
kind
of
policy
consideration
so
that
the
judgment
below
should
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
mr.
samuel
w.
murphy,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
if
the
court
please.
i
think
we
would
differ
a
bit
with
to
the
deputy
attorney
general
in
stating
the
question
presented
on
this
appeal.
we
would
state
the
question
as
being
whether
aid
finance
export
sales
made
in
competition
with
foreign
producers.
this
export
trade,
as
those
words
are
used
in
the
webb
act,
it
seems
to
us
of
considerable
importance
on
the
stipulated
facts
of
this
record.
importance
both
in
terms
of
the
general
significance
of
the
case
to
the
propositions
the
government
is
putting
forward
and
the
importance
in
terms
of
the
outcome
of
the
case
that
there
was
active
foreign
competition
here
in
each
of
the
transactions
challenged
by
the
government
with
one
exception,
that
one
exception
being
a
transaction
on
which
the
defendants
received
no
award
of
the
business.
in
the
webb-pomerene
act
in
defining
export
trade,
congress
went
to
particular
care
to
outline
first
what
export
trade
was
to
be
covered
by
the
immunity
of
the
webb-act
defining
it
in
terms
of
the
export
of
goods
from
this
country
to
another.
it
also
defined
export
trade
in
terms
of
what
it
is
not.
it
is
not
production.
it
is
not
manufactured.
and
it
is
not
sale
within
the
united
states
for
resale
or
consumption
here.
in
addition,
congress
attached
a
series
of
provisos
in
which
it
was
stated
that
even
no
one
act
might
be
within
export
trade
as
literally
defined.
it
would
nevertheless
be
subject
to
the
sherman
act
prohibitions
if
it
resulted
in
any
effect,
artificial
or
intentional
effect
on
prices
on
the
united
states,
any
restraint
of
the
export
trade
of
domestic
competitors
on
the
association
or
any
restraint
of
trade
in
the
united
states.
this
is
a
stipulated
record.
it
is
stipulated
here
that
the
goods
sold
by
the
defendants
were
exported
from
this
country,
not
only
to
korea
but
to
38
other
countries.
it
is
stipulated
that
the
defendants
met
all
of
the
requirements
of
the
webb-pomerene
act.
now,
it
is
conceded
that
they
did
not
violate
any
of
its
provisos.
consequently
that
being
so,
it
seems
to
us
that
the
ultimate
question
presented
to
this
court
by
this
appeal
is
whether
the
transaction
is
challenged
by
the
government
were
so
radically
different
from
anything
that
congress
might
have
had
in
mind
in
1918.
as
to
justify
or
require
a
departure
from
the
otherwise
pretty
plain
english
of
that
law.
mr.
samuel
w.
murphy,
jr.
i
think
a
practical
sense,
justice
fortas,
that
would
depend
on
other
facts
not
in
your
question.
our
position
is
that
as
a
general
proposition,
the
test
of
whether
the
webb
act
applies
is
the
ultimate
and
intended
destination
of
the
goods.
but
i
would
believe
that
in
the
case
where
the
sale
were
to
the
united
states
and
for
used
by
the
united
states,
some
place
out
that
one
of
the
provisos
attached
by
the
act
might
well
come
into
play
dependent
on
the
facts
of
the
situation.
mr.
samuel
w.
murphy,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
samuel
w.
murphy,
jr.
i
think
that
that
transaction
given
only
those
facts
would
be
entitled
to
the
exemption
of
the
webb
act
by
the
test
that
congress
has
laid
down.
mr.
samuel
w.
murphy,
jr.
we
also
rely
very
heavily
justice
fortas
on
the
presence
of
foreign
competition.
there's
just
no
question
that
the
webb-pomerene
act
was
designed
basically
to
encourage
american
companies
to
participate
more
extensively
in
export
trade
by
allowing
them
to
collaborate
not
only
for
the
purposes
suggested
by
the
government
but
also
for
the
purposes
of
reducing
cost
and
mastering
greater
resources.
mr.
samuel
w.
murphy,
jr.
no,
i
don't
believe
i
would
agree
with
that
justice
fortas.
mr.
samuel
w.
murphy,
jr.
i
wouldn't
agree
that
that
fact
standing
alone
is
determinative
but
it
seems
to
me
certainly
one
of
the
most
significant
facts.
in
our
case,
as
i
understand
it,
the
government's
position
comes
down
solely
that
a
proposition
that
there
was
injury
to
the
united
states.
an
injury
which
they
presumed
as
i
understand
there
case
from
applying
to
the
sales
of
this
webb-pomerene
association,
sherman
act
principles
to
which
congress
has
said
are
not
to
apply
so
long
as
that
association
is
engaged
in
export
trade
and
that
seems
to
us
a
peculiar
avenue
along
which
to
approach
the
question
of
whether
this
was
export
trade.
but
even
if
you
start
down
that
avenue
at
a
reason
why
we
emphasize
foreign
competition
here,
even
if
you
start
down
that
avenue,
it
is
our
further
position
that
you
find
no
injury,
no
injury
in
fact.
now,
mr.
christopher
has
emphasize
that
in
his
argument
and
the
government
has
in
its
brief
the
point
that
the
republic
of
korea
bought
concentrated
phosphates
in
this
particular
transactions
using
grant
funds
and
that
therefore
there
was
a
burden
on
the
united
states.
i
suggest
the
burden
is
far
greater
where
a
foreign
competitor
wins
an
award
of
that
business
because
that's
foreign
competitor
was
just
as
eligible
as
where
this
defendants
to
be
paid
an
aid
dollars.
and
every
aid
dollar
paid
to
a
supplier
from
tunisia
on
account
of
his
sale
to
the
republic
of
korea
was
a
dollar
that
was
gone
from
the
united
states.
whereas
every
dollar
that
these
defendants
obtained
in
this
korean
market
as
was
true
with
the
dollars
it
obtained
in
selling
in
30
(a)
other
markets
was
a
dollar
kept
in
the
united
states
and
to
that
extent
on
the
facts
of
this
case
it
seemed
to
me
if
there
is
a
physical
burden
of
any
kind
we
help
to
reduce
it.
mr.
samuel
w.
murphy,
jr.
i
believe
he
used
the
figure
about
16%.
mr.
samuel
w.
murphy,
jr.
i
was
not
clear.
there
were
13
transactions
with
korea.
mr.
samuel

of
which
are
not

case
justice
white.
mr.
samuel
w.

jr.
quite
so
and
it
won
awards
in
the
most
(voice
overlap).
mr.
samuel
w.
murphy,
jr.
absolutely.
mr.
samuel
w.
murphy,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
if
the
court
please,
i
should
like
to
return
briefly
to
two
questions
as
just
before
the
recess.
mr.
justice
fortas
asked
the
question
of
where
delivery
was
made
on
the
two
transactions
in
which
gsa
participated.
according
to
the
agreement,
justice
fortas,
between
gsa
and
aid
and
the
pertinent
part
is
printed
at
page
288
of
the
appendix,
delivery
was
to
be
made
to
aid
or
to
its
designee
which
in
this
case
was
the
republic
of
korea
and
the
papers
on
one
of
those
transactions
which
are
printed
in
the
appendix
beginning
at
page
293
shows
that
in
that
transaction
delivery
of
the
commodities
was
made
to
a
vessel
in
a
florida
port
consigned
to
the
republic
of
korea.
as
to
the
questions
of
justice
white
about
this
excessive
foreign
producers
on
these
transactions
which
i'm
not
sure
i
answered
too
clearly.
of
the
11
korean
procurements
financed
by
the
agency
for
international
development,
foreign
producers
won
18%
of
the
total
amount
of
business
awarded
on
11
transactions.
just
before
the
recess,
i
was
saying
--
mr.
samuel
w.
murphy,
jr.
sir?
mr.
samuel
w.
murphy,
jr.
korea
awarded
--
mr.
samuel
w.
murphy,
jr.
well,
korea
invited
tenders
on
and
awarded
very
substantial
tonnages
and
a
particular
bidder
would
also
make
a
variety
of
bids
depending
on
delivery
time,
different
prices
for
different
quantities,
different
delivery
periods
and
in
many
of
these
transactions,
the
awards
were
split
so
much
to
these
defendants
and
so
much
to
another
american
supplier,
so
much
to
a
foreign
producer.
mr.
samuel
w.
murphy,
jr.
oh!
no
question
about
that.
now
before
getting
back
into
the
facts
which
at
least
as
we
view
of
them
showed
that
these
who
are
not
totally
different
transactions
from
the
kind
--
congress
contemplated,
i
would
also
like
to
note
in
passing
that
the
congress
which
enacted
the
webb-pomerene
act
in
1917
and
1918
was
itself
very
busy
in
foreign
aid.
it
was
during
that
period
that
congress
was
authorizing
and
appropriating
very
considerable
sums
of
money
for
foreign
assistance
programs.
so
that
certainly
congress
had
within
its
general
contemplation
in
adopting
the
webb
act
that
export
trade
associations
would
trade
in
foreign
markets
that
were
supported
in
united
states
that
recognition
was
expressed
during
the
debates
prior
to
passage
of
the
act
and
at
the
end
of
world
war
1
and
immediately
thereafter,
export
trade
associations
did
sell
at
that
time
to
european
customers
who
were
totally
dependent
on
the
financial
assistance
of
the
united
states.
export
trade
associations
have
continued
to
make
those
sales
from
time
to
time
during
the
50
years
since
the
act
was
passed.
during
war
time
and
post-war
period
in
the
land
lease
program
as
it
stipulated
in
various
of
the
modern
foreign
aid
programs.
during
that
same
period,
the
congress
has
regularly
reviewed
the
foreign
assistance
programs
and
has
frequently
reviewed
the
webb
act
and
has
never
at
anytime
suggested
that
it
intended
in
anyway
in
adopting
the
modern
foreign
assistance
programs
to
roll
back
the
webb
act
as
the
government
now
acts.
now,
mr.
christopher
referred
to
a
sentence
in
judge
ryan's
opinion
below
which
does
seem
to
me
a
good
way
to
get
into
a
more
detailed
discussion
as
some
of
the
facts
here
in
which
judge
ryan
and
i
am
referring
to
page
362,
the
joint
appendix
says
it
seems
obviously
unfair
to
the
united
states
in
describing
the
situation
in
which
webb
associations
sell
the
foreign
aid
finance
customer.
it's
quite
clear
to
us
that
judge
ryan
in
that
sentence
was
describing
the
government's
argument.
he
says,
herein
is
the
core
of
the
government's
argument.
we
cannot
say
that
it
does
not
have
appeal
and
then
follows
the
sentence
that
mr.
christopher
referred
to.
but
judge
ryan
then
goes
on
in
the
balance
of
his
opinion
to
set
forth
his
conclusions.
as
to
why
the
government's
position
why
the
superficial
appeal
of
unfairness
in
the
government's
position
is
simply
not
so
as
a
matter
of
fact.
now,
in
this
particular
case,
we
rely
quite
heavily
on
the
aspect
of
foreign
competition
as
meeting
any
suggestion
of
fairness
--
unfairness
as
well
as
two
other
aspects
of
the
case.
first,
the
full
disclosure
to
and
yet
encouragement
by
officials
of
both
the
korean
and
united
states
government
of
the
defendant's
participation
in
a
finance
business;
and
secondly,
the
facts,
the
stipulated
facts
which
is
we
view
and
i'm
quite
clearly
demonstrate
that
there
was
no
injury
here
to
united
states
as
a
matter
of
fact.
now,
these
defendants
and
their
association
registered
with
the
federal
trade
commission,
there's
no
question
about
that,
observed
all
of
formal
requirements
of
the
webb
act.
they
did
what
congress
intended
where
the
associations
to
do.
the
association
went
out
and
sold
american
produced
phosphates
wherever
it
could
find
or
create
demand
all
over
the
world
in
38
countries
in
addition
to
korea,
although
korea
was
the
single
most
important
consumer
or
purchaser
of
these
association's
products.
at
all
times,
it
is
stipulated
aid,
gsa,
and
the
office
of
supply
of
the
republic
of
korea,
knew
what
the
defendants
were,
knew
how
they
did
do
business
and
at
all
times,
all
of
our
bids
to
korea
were
made
in
response
to
formal
invitations
in
competitive
public
bidding
procedures.
now,
we
don't
suggest
that
those
facts
themselves
give
rise
to
any
kind
of
an
antitrust
immunity
and
we
don't
suggest
that
aid's
regulations
and
activities
take
the
place
of
either
the
webb
act
on
the
one
hand
or
the
sherman
act
on
the
other.
but
they
are
facts
which
do
seem
to
us
to
be
quite
significant
as
they
relate
to
the
threat
running
through
the
government's
case
suggesting
unfairness
on
our
part
and
perhaps
even
more
importantly,
we
believe
that
they
are
significant
to
the
question
of
injury.
had
aid
officials
believed
that
their
program
was
being
in
any
way
burdened
by
the
activities
of
these
defendants,
in
any
way
injured
or
frustrated
as
the
government
has
suggested
by
these
defendants.
i
think
it's
unreasonable
to
conclude
that
they
would
nevertheless
have
solicited
bids
from
us.
when
aid
clearly
did
possess
the
authority
which
it
exercised
on
january
1,
1967
they
shot
webb
act
associations
out
of
aid
finance
markets.
now,
a
second
important
fact
is
this
factor
foreign
competition
which
is
already
been
covered
quite
thoroughly
and
that
brings
me
to
what
i
think
is
the
quite
clear
fact
that
there
is
just
no
evidence
in
this
stipulated
record
that
there
was
any
injury
of
any
kind.
that
there
was
any
burden
of
any
kind
on
the
united
states
any
harm
either
that
korea
or
to
the
united
states
foreign
aid
program
and
this
is
a
stipulated
record.
during
the
hearing
below
before
judge
ryan
which
took
the
place
of
a
full
trial,
he
probed
quite
carefully
into
this
question
and
in
response
to
his
questions,
the
government's
counsel
conceded
there
was
no
suggestion
here
by
the
government
that
the
defendant
or
their
association
had
in
any
way
overcharged
either
aid
or
korea,
or
had
engaged
in
any
way
in
any
unfair,
unreasonable
or
discriminatory
price.
there
is
never
been
any
suggestion
in
this
case
of
any
damage,
any
injury,
any
burden,
any
unfairness.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
only
injury
that
is
set
to
flow
here
flows
from
applying
to
business
activities
which
are
exempt
from
the
sherman
act,
principles
that
would
apply
only
if
the
exemption
were
lost.
now,
not
only
is
there
no
injury
but
if
the
court
please,
we
think
the
record
is
quite
clear
that
the
evidence
relating
to
that
question
is
quite
to
the
contrary.
mr.
samuel
w.
murphy,
jr.
well,
i
haven't
thought
about
that
on
that
basis,
justice
fortas
but
i
do
agree
that
a
sale
to
the
untied
states
for
consumption
by
the
united
states
is
not
included.
mr.
samuel
w.
murphy,
jr.
i
would
begin
by
saying
that
that
i
do
not
agree
that
a
sale
of
commodities
to
the
united
states
which
commodities
the
united
states
then
gives
away
to
a
foreign
consumer
is
outside
the
webb
exemption.
i
think
that
is
within
the
webb
exemption.
mr.
samuel
w.
murphy,
jr.
within
the
webb
act,
yes
sir.
mr.
samuel
w.
murphy,
jr.
that's
correct.
that
that
is
export
trade
as
the
webb
act
defines
it.
mr.
samuel
w.
murphy,
jr.
well,
quite
frankly,
justice
fortas,
i
am
unable
to
answer
the
sovereign
--
the
sovereignty
aspects
of
your
question
and
i
do
not
think
that
this
is
a
position
that
we
have
to
defend
in
this
case
that
it
is
--
mr.
samuel
w.
murphy,
jr.
yes.
mr.
samuel
w.
murphy,
jr.
i
must
have
misunderstood
your
questions
justice
fortas
but
my
position
would
be
and
is
that
congress
set
out
a
clear
test
in
using
the
word
"export"
in
that
same
sense
that
it
had
become
settled
in
the
law
by
that
the
sense
of
its
ultimate
resting
place.
i
believe
that
i
responded
to
your
similar
question
before
the
recess
justice
fortas
by
saying
that
in
my
view,
on
the
facts
you
post
that
is
a
government
purchase
and
government
consumption
abroad.
mr.
samuel
w.
murphy,
jr.
that
the
provisos
would
come
into
play
and
depending
on
the
facts
and
the
situation,
it
would
be
found
that
there
was
a
kind
of
effect
on
domestic
commerce
which
the
act,
the
webb
act
proscribes.
but
in
this
case,
it
has
been
stipulated
that
the
united
states
was
not
the
purchaser
on
page
49
of
the
appendix
in
our
stipulation
it
states
aid
did
not
itself
procure
any
concentrated
phosphates
for
korean
and
the
record
is
replete
with
the
fact
--
mr.
samuel
w.
murphy,
jr.
well,
the
government
as
i
understand
it
attributes
no
significance
to
the
difference
and
in
our
view
gsa's
participation
did
not
order
the
substance
of
the
transactions
at
all.
now,
mr.
christopher
has
suggested
that
this
is
a
very
significant
case
in
which
the
government
needs
a
broad
ruling
which
brings
one
naturally
to
the
question
justice
fortas
also
raised
this
warning
about
mootness.
in
the
first
instance,
we
would
emphasize
that
narrowness
of
this
case
stipulated
record
the
fact
that
it
relates
to
aid
finance
only
to
aid
finance
markets
in
which
there
is
foreign
competition.
the
emphasis
placed
in
the
case
by
the
government
on
the
fact
that
korea
used
grand
rather
than
loan
aid
whereas
at
the
present
time,
grants
form
a
relatively
small
part
of
total
foreign
aid.
now,
finally,
the
whatever
significance
this
narrow
case
had
was
pretty
well
sucked
out
of
it
when
effective
january
1,
1967
aid
adopted
a
regulation
which
went
directly
to
the
question
of
the
extent
to
which
webb
associations
can
deal
and
aid
finance
markets
by
providing
that
such
associations
would
not
be
eligible
to
bid
unless
foreign
suppliers
were
also
eligible
to
bid.
the
practical
consequence
of
that
regulation
was
to
put
this
association
out
of
business.
the
association
seized
all
operations
in
june
of
1967,
has
made
no
sales
since
then,
and
the
association
was
formally
dissolved
and
entirely
abandoned
at
the
end
of
last
year.
the
government's
case
it
seems
to
us
comes
down
to
a
policy
argument
that
is
somehow
a
bad
thing
to
allow
export
associations
to
sell
to
foreign
customers
being
finance
to
the
united
states
government.
we
suggest
that
that
is
an
argument
better
addressed
to
the
congress
and
to
this
court
and
that
in
any
event,
the
narrow
nature
and
now
the
dead
nature
of
this
case
will
not
support
the
weight
of
that
kind
of
policy
consideration
so
that
the
judgment
below
should
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
