mr.

thank

mr.
chief

may
it
please
the
court.
counsel
for
the
government
has
relied
upon
the
regulation
as
something
it
has
--
is
in
support
of
the
consistent
administrative
of
construction
since
1937
that
the
government
does
not
accept
the
$100.00
tax.
now,
the
regulations
are
part
of
the
government's
brief
in
the
leary
matter
and
i
believe
in
covington
as
well
starting
on
page
58.
these
regulations
states
starting
with
the
first
one,
the
tax
applies
to
every
transfer
and
that's
put
in
the
regulation
since
1937.
amount
of
tax
where
they
transfers
to
a
taxable
person
who
was
duly
registered
and
paid
the
special
tax,
the
transfer
tax
is
at
the
rate
of
a
dollar
per
ounce
of
fraction
thereof.
if
the
transfers
to
be
to
a
person
was
not
registered
and
paid
the
special
tax
under
this
act,
tax
at
the
rate
of
$100.00
per
ounce
of
fraction
thereof
is
due.
that's
in
the
19
--
regulation
since
1937.
on
page
59
of
the
government's
appendix,
this
is
59
of
their
brief,
again
in
the
regulations
it
states
that
on
the
order
form
the
application
shall
show
that
transferee's
name,
address,
and
if
registered,
the
registration
number
so
that
the
order
form
regulation
since
1937
has
contemplated
a
non-registrant
applying
for
an
order
form.
now,
what
is
there
in
the
regulations
of
the
government
does
rely
on?
they
rely
on
the
signature
and
comparison
regulations,
the
only
thing
and
either
the
statute,
the
legislative
history
or
any
place
that
says
anything
about
a
registration
is
tied
in
with
the
order
form.
now,
in
the
signature
and
comparison
regulations,
it
does
state
that
the
internal
revenue
district
is
to
take
an
application
for
an
order
form
and
compare
the
signature
on
that
application
with
the
list
of
registrant's
signatures
which
are
on
file.
that
is
those
that
paid
their
occupational
tax.
now,
that's
all
the
government
can
hang
their
head
on
and
i
think
that
that
is
easily
explained.
that
is
if
you
want
to
commend
with
an
application
for
an
order
form
and
pay
a
dollar
an
ounce
tax,
the
way
that
you
prove
that
all
you
have
to
pay
is
a
dollar
an
ounce
is
by
signing
and
showing
that
you
are
a
registrant
to
what
comparing
it
to
your
signature
on
file
and
that
is
consistent.
those
regulations
with
the
dollar
an
ounce
tax
claim
and
if
the
comparison
does
not
show
up
in
the
internal
revenue
district,
you
got
to
pay
the
$100.00
an
ounce
tax.
that's
all
and
is
in
this
so-called
1937
to
date
consistent
construction
by
the
government
and
plenty
against
it.
in
connection
with
this
rather
subtle
point
that
you
can't
prepay
the
tax
and
that
all
and
unlawful
possess
it
can
do
is
post
pay
the
tax
and
go
to
jail.
i
mean
that's
really
what
the
government
is
saying.
the
statutes
themselves
expressly
provide
to
the
contrary.
the
4741
which
imposes
the
tax
in
subdivision
(b)
and
(a)
imposes
the
rate
a
dollar
and
$100.00
and
in
(b)
by
whom
pay
such
tax
and
now
without
any
distinction
between
the
dollar
and
a
hundred
search
tax
shall
be
paid
by
the
transferee
at
that
time
of
securing
each
order
form
and
shall
be
in
addition
to
the
price
of
the
form.
it's
very
clear
that
tax
payment
both
the
dollar
and
a
hundred
is
contemplated
at
the
time
you
go
to
the
secretary
of
that
treasury
and
get
you
order
form.
the
order
form
again,
it
sometime
pays
to
look
at
the
plain
statute
in
what
it
says
in
light
of
the
sophisticated
argument.
the
order
form
requirement
4742
says,
“it
shall
be
unlawful
for
any
person
whether
or
not
required
to
pay
a
special
tax
and
to
register
to
transfer
marihuana.
and
the
tax
is
--
the
$100.00
tax
is
upon
each
transfer
to
any
person
who
has
not
paid
the
special
tax
and
register.”
it's
all
embracing,
the
statute
says,
it
is
to
be
paid
at
the
time
you
get
your
order
form.
the
order
form
speaks
prospectively
in
subsection
(c)
of
the
order
form
requirement
4742.
it
talks
about
the
name
and
address
of
the
proposed
vendor
and
proposed
vendee.
so
that
you
are
suppose
to
legitimatize
your
transaction
beforehand
by
paying
your
tax
and
securing
your
order
form.
this
is
on
the
face
of
the
statute.
the
regulation's
reiterate
this
position.
the
crime,
it
is
interesting
is
in
4744
and
it
says,
“it's
unlawful
for
any
person
who
is
a
transferee
required
to
pay
the
transfer
tax
imposed
by
4741
to
acquire
marihuana
without
having
paid
such
tax.”
again,
very
clear
that
the
tax
is
to
be
paid
prior
to
the
transaction
and
it's
expressly
contemplated
by
the
statute.
i
thank
the
