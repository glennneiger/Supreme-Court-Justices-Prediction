is
that
from
the
$3.00
and
$1.00?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
but
does
the
government
depended
to
$100.00
has
ever
collected?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
mean
at
the
time
of
transfer
of
marihuana
illegally
under
state
law
that
is
that
i
can
pay
the
$100.00
tax
collected?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
do
you
think
that
after
conviction
it
governed
with
the
civil
action?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
if
and
when,
that's
what
i
want
to
know.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
government
will
accept
the
$100.00?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
why
is
it
this
--
do
you
mean
levied
by
assessment?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
the
--
there
is
liability
for
$100.00
tax?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
the
person
wants
to
is
there
a
penalty
involved
for
not
paying
--
for
non-payment
civil
type
penalty?
justice
byron
r.
white
there's
interest
anyway?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
--
how
do
you
really
distinguish
this
from
grosso,
but
that
the
payment
of
the
tax
itself?
justice
byron
r.
white
government
--
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
mean
to
pay
the
tax
yourself
that
we
can
collect
the
premium
with
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
no
pressure
on
the
person
because
if
he
doesn't
pay
the
tax,
he
doesn't
break
the
law
but
if
he
doesn't
pay
the
tax,
the
government
assesses
that
he
done?
justice
byron
r.
white
like
peculiar
situation.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
isn't
the
point.
the
point
is
that
paying
tax
and
liabilities
for
the
tax
indicates
that
he
has
already
broken
the
law,
that
he
is
among
that
category
a
which
to
get
an
order
form
and
at
the
end
of
the
guilty
plea
transfer
the
marihuana?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
can
you
pay
the
tax
and
say,
“i
am
in
that
category.”
both
people
who
have
illegally
committed
--
illegal
to
formulate
the
things?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
government
wants
to
argue
that
the
general
liability
applicable
to
law
the
income
tax
--
is
there
suspect
as
the
grosso
situation
and
argue
its
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
don't
think
the
argument
now
did.
justice
byron
r.
white
about
the
embezzlement.
justice
byron
r.
white
don't
you
think
the
government
gets
some
clue
that
i
transferred
narcotics
illegally
if
i
have
to
come
forward
and
pay
a
tax?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
i'm
the
only
--
the
only
reason
i
have
to
pay
$100.00
is
that
i
have
transferred
it
illegally?
justice
byron
r.
white
well.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
maybe
the
first
thing
the
government
heard
of
it
that
i
transferred
illegally
is
that
if
i
come
forward
and
pay
the
tax?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
he
is
expected
to
pay
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
on
the
face
of
the
law
is
exempted
for
the
liability
for
not
paying
the
tax
itself?
justice
byron
r.
white
incase
he
forget
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
just
forget
that
and
say,
well
if
he
doesn't
deny
this
means
civil
liability?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
certainly
agree
we're
not
talking
about
the
harrison
law
in
this
case.
so,
it
is
different,
isn't?
justice
byron

white
but
why
didn't
they
just
do
it
like
the
harrison
act?
justice
byron

the

doubts
in
here

the

you
mean
a

may
not
