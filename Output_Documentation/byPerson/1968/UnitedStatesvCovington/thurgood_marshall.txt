what
is
this?
is
this
really
a
tax
or
fine?
justice
thurgood

will
have
the

effect
as
the
fine.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i'm
fined
for
the
purpose
of
deterrent?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
as
i
understand
you
this
can
view
this
never
comes
up
until
after
you
violate
it
then
they
file
a
civil
suit
to
collect
the
fine.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
the
word.
justice
thurgood
marshall
to
make
it
clearer
that
this
was
a
legitimate
exercise
of
the
tax
power,
they
impose
to
transfer
tax.
the
legislative
history
is
clear
on
this.
this
is
why
they
thought
there
would
be
absolutely
no
constitutional
problem
under
the
tax
power
because
these
transactions
are
subject
to
the
taxing
power.
they
are
subject
to
a
tax
and
it
was
thought
obvious
that
congress
in
its
exercise
to
the
tax
power
can
legitimately
distinguish
between
types
of
taxable
transactions
and
make
determinations
as
to
how
the
transactions
must
be
carried
on
if
at
all.
but
i
would
like
to
say
that
as
the
legislative
history
does
relate
because
in
the
house
committee
report
were,
this
was
actually
as
the
revenue
bill
originated
in
the
house.
it
was
expressly
stated
that
insofar
as
the
tax
power
might
be
argued
not
to
support
a
complete
prohibition
such
as
was
being
enacted.
the
report
states
it
is
clear
that
the
commerce
power
and
the
other
powers
of
congress
for
instance
a
power
over
the
district
of
columbia
and
the
territories
would
also
support
this.
i
might
point
out
that
we
have
today
even
a
further
support
for
a
complete
prohibition
such
as
this
and
i
think
it
standard
constitutional
doctrine
that
even
if
congress
misapprehends
the
power
that
it's
relying
and
a
statute
is
not
ultra
vires
if
there
is
some
constitutional
support
even
if
it's
not
the
clause
that
congress
relied
on
to
sustain
statute.
the
united
states
is
now
a
party
to
an
international
convention
enforced
with
some
67
other
states
--
nation
states
which
expressly
obliges
the
united
states
to
impose
the
maximum
controls
on
heroin,
opium,
and
marihuana.
we
think
that
the
interplay
of
all
of
these
constitutional
clauses
is
more
than
adequate
authority
to
sustain
the
absolute
prohibition
on
illicit
transfers
that
congress
has
enacted
and
the
administrators
have
implemented.
there
was
also
a
claim
made
that
this
is
a
noble
contention
because
it's
inconsistent
with
what
this
--
with
the
government
has
advised
the
court
or
congress
in
the
past.
a
petitioner
in
the
leary
case
cited
our
sanchez
brief
which
was
the
case
in
which
the
court
sustained
the
constitutionality
of
the
$100.00
per
ounce
transfer
tax
in
a
civil
assessment
proceeding.
nothing
that
we
said
in
sanchez
it's
in
any
way
inconsistent
with
what
we
say
here.
the
two
sentences
quoted
in
the
reply
brief
upon
behalf
of
petitioner
in
leary
are
in
the
course
of
a
discussion
in
which
we
said
congress
went
beyond
what
it
had
done
in
the
harrison
act.
and
the
harrison
act,
it
had
simply
enacted
a
direct
prohibition
unrelated
to
the
tax
power.
in
this
act,
the
marihuana
act,
we
said
in
sanchez
and
the
court
ultimately
agreed
that
it
was
constitutional
to
do
it
this
way.
congress
didn't
fashion
a
direct
prohibition
without
more.
it
went
beyond
this
and
as
we
said
in
the
language
which
i
believe
is
quoted
in
their
brief
--
reply
brief,
congress
did
more
in
addition
to
achieve
in
that
same
effect
it
also
provided
that
there
would
revenue
raised
through
the
course
of
transferring
marihuana.
and
for
that
reason
as
i
suggested
before,
the
controls
that
were
imposed
on
the
transfer
of
marihuana
we
thought
to
be
valid
a
fortiori
from
those
that
have
been
sustained
albeit
by
divided
courts
in
doremus
and
alston,
webb,
wong
sing,
and
nigro.
the
same
thing
is
true
with
respect
to
the
memorandum
by
the
treasury
in
relating
to
the
guam
organic
act
all
that
recognize.
i
think
that's
quoted
in
the
amicus
brief
filed
on
behalf
for
the
american
civil
liberties
union.
that
memorandum
reflects
that
the
marihuana
tax
act
is
not
a
complete
prohibition
on
the
transfer
of
marihuana
as
it
is
not
because
there
are
still
lawful
uses
for
marihuana
at
least
in
the
united
states.
it
is
still
possible
to
deal
in
marihuana
lawfully.
the
treasury
memorandum
said,
“there
are
no
lawfully
uses
for
marihuana
in
guam,”
there
isn't
any
research
being
conducted,
it's
not
grown
for
hand
purposes.
so,
rather
than
preserved
the
possibility
of
some
legitimate
dealings
in
marihuana
in
guam
where
it's
unnecessary,
we
will
substitute
for
it
a
direct
categorical
prohibition
so
that
no
one
in
guam
can
lawfully
deal
in
marihuana.
in
the
united
states,
that
is
not
true
and
in
fact
there
are
approximately
90
federal
registrants
who
having
complied
with
state
requirements
for
handling
marihuana
are
eligible
to
register
under
the
federal
act
and
can
lawfully
transfer
marihuana
upon
payment
of
the
$1.00
an
ounce
transfer
tax.
the
essence
of
all
of
this
is
that
as
the
act
was
drafted
with
the
clear
objective
of
stamping
out
transfers
to
illegitimate
addict
and
as
the
administrative
agencies
had
consistently
administered
the
act.
there
is
no
real
problem
of
incrimination
because
those
whose
obtaining
of
marihuana
would
violate
state
law
are
not
expected
to
come
forward
to
register.
they're
not
allowed
to
register.
they're
not
expected
to
come
forward
to
obtain
order
forms
or
to
prepay
the
tax.
they
will
not
be
allowed
to
do
this
because
congress
was
not
unlike
the
firearms
case
and
unlike
the
wagering
cases.
congress
was
not
willing
to
provide
federal
sanction
for
this
type
of
conduct
with
the
intent
of
exposing
it
to
prosecution
under
state
law.
the
federal
and
state
provisions
in
this
area
are
in
complete
tandem
only
lawful
dealers
under
state
law
can
comply
with
the
federal
act.
anyone
who
can't
comply
with
state
law
cannot
comply
with
the
federal
act.
so,
we
have
federal
enforcement
power
to
reinforce
as
a
matter
of
federal
law
the
ban
on
the
transfer
of
marihuana
for
smoking
or
addiction.
we
suggest
this
is
radically
different
from
the
wagering
and
firearms
cases.
and
that
the
reason
that
people
don't
comply
with
this
statute
is
not
there's
any
fear
of
incrimination,
it
is
because
they're
not
eligible
to
comply
because
there
is
a
prohibitive
tax
that
is
imposed
and
a
tax
which
congress
did
not
contemplate
could
be
paid
before
the
transaction
took
place.
i
would
like
to
save
any
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.

the
