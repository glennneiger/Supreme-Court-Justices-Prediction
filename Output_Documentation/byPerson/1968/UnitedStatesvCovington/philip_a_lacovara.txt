mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
before
i
begin
the
statement
of
the
covington
case
which
is
now
being
considered,
i'd
like
to
clear
up
a
misapprehension
which
maybe
left
with
the
court.
the
tax
imposed
on
the
transfer
of
marihuana
to
a
non-registrant
is
$100.00
per
ounce
or
fraction
thereof.
so,
while
it
is
possible
according
to
bureau
of
narcotics
statistics
to
obtain
between
85
and
100
cigarettes
from
each
ounce
of
marihuana.
the
transfer
of
even
of
a
cigarette
which
would
have
perhaps
100
of
an
ounce
would
still
be
subject
to
a
$100.00
tax
because
any
transfer
of
marihuana
no
matter
how
is
like
if
to
a
non-registrant
is
subject
to
the
$100.00
tax.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes,
that
is
a
matter
of
public
record.
in
the
fiscal
year
1967
that
would
be
july
1,
1966
through
january
--
through
june
30,
1967,
$177,000.00
was
collected
under
the
marihuana
tax
act.
for
calendar
year
1967,
the
figure
is
about
$270,000.00.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
this
is
all
revenue
collected
under
the
tax.
it
includes
the
special
occupational
tax
and
the
transfer
taxes
in
amounts
of
$1.00
and
$100.00.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
no,
sir.
absolutely
not
in
our
brief.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
if
you
are
not
eligible
to
comply
with
state
law,
you
cannot
register
with
the
director
of
internal
revenue
under
the
marihuana
tax
act.
it
is
our
contention
that
if
you're
not
eligible
for
federal
registration
you
cannot
prepay
the
tax
or
obtain
federal
order
points.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
not
always
after
conviction
but
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
--
after
the
transfer
--
the
illegal
transfer
has
taken
place,
the
sanchez
case
before
this
court.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
the
tax
is
levied
by
an
assessment.
i'm
not
aware
of
any
situation
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
in
the
civil
suit,
yes.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
there
is
absolutely,
yes.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
i'm
not
sure
whether
the
50%
surcharge
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes,
there
would
be
6%
interest.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
well,
i
think
there's
a
very
critical
distinction
in
grosso.
the
individual
was
required
to
come
forward
and
pay
the
tax
on
his
own
initiative
and
he
fail
to
do
so,
he
was
subject
to
criminal
prosecution.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
in
this
situation,
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
if
the
government
bears
the
burden
of
proof,
there
is
nothing
even
in
grosso.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
no,
there
is
no
additional
criminal
violation.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
mr.
justice,
there
is
no
additional
criminal
violation
in
not
paying
the
tax
after
the
transaction
has
occurred
and
the
way
the
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes,
and
the
government
is
not
punishing
him
for
failing
to
waive
his
fifth
amendment
right.
the
government
is
saying,
“we
have
information
that
you
illegally
obtained
marihuana.
that
is
a
taxable
transaction
for
which
you
are
liable.”
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
the
same
could
be
said
about
an
embezzler
who
fails
to
report
the
proceeds
of
an
embezzlement
on
his
income
tax
return
if
the
government
and
it
brings
a
civil
suit
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
we're
not
willing
to
suggest
that
the
income
tax
is
fatally
a
suspect.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
well,
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
in
practical
effect,
we
suggest
that
there
really
is
no
fifth
amendment
difference
in
this
situation.
the
penalty
that's
being
imposed
in
the
civil
assessment
is
something
that
the
court
expressly
in
grosso
and
marchetti
and
haynes
said
was
allowable.
the
court
expressly
said
the
tax
is
not
invalid
in
these
situations
and
the
government
can
take
steps
to
collect
it
civilly.
the
only
thing
that
the
government
may
not
do
is
prosecute
a
man
criminally
for
not
having
come
forward
to
pay
the
tax.
this
act
is
different
from
the
firearms
and
the
wagering
tax
acts
because
as
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
you
don't.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
you
obtained
it
illegally.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
but
what
we're
saying
is
that
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
well,
mr.
justice,
i
have
to
reiterate
that
the
way
the
statute
was
drafted
and
the
way
it's
been
interpreted
under
the
regulations
for
the
past
30
years
and
illegal
acquisition
the
person
who
acquires
marihuana
illegally
that
is
in
most
situation
someone
who
was
a
non-registrant
is
not
expected
to
come
forward
and
pay
the
tax.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
if
the
government
brings
suit
against
him
and
a
judgment
is
rendered
establishing
his
civil
liability
then
the
tax
is
collected
as
any
assessment
is.
but,
it
was
never
contemplated
by
congress
in
the
administrative
agencies
have
never
expected.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes,
that
the
statute
doesn't
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
statute
that
is
involved
here
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
no,
sir.
what
we
contend
the
statute
says
and
what
it
means
is
that
any
transfer,
any
receipt
of
marihuana
by
an
individual
who
cannot
obtain
federal
authority
for
it
is
a
criminal
offense
because
the
tax
is
said
up
in
a
way
to
make
it
a
crime
for
a
person
in
the
course
of
taxable
transaction
to
obtain
marihuana
without
the
authority
to
obtain
it.
there
are
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
well,
i
don't
suggest
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
no,
congress
wrote
the
criminal
statute.
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
both
briefs
the
clear
legislative
history
indicating
that
congress
did
intend
to
achieve
an
absolute
prohibition
upon
any
transfers
of
marihuana
except
in
what
this
court
in
sanchez
called
legitimate
medicinal
scientific
and
industrial
channels.
because
there
have
been
four
dissents
in
doremus
and
three
dissents
in
nigro
about
the
ability
of
congress
to
enact
the
complete
prohibition
on
illicit
transfers
without
using
the
tax
power.
and
i
think
it's
important
to
know
that
there
is
no
transfer
tax
under
the
harrison
act
and
that
was
why
the
dissents
in
those
two
cases
had
set
congress,
there's
no
legitimate
relation
between
an
attempt
to
distinguish
law
from
unlawful
transactions.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
that's
right
and
that's
why
congress
indemonstrably
trying
to
achieve
the
same
result
making
it
the
crime
to
transfer
marihuana.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
because
of
the
--
then
doubts
about
the
constitutional
power.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
no,
sir.
in
this
situation,
congress
imposed
to
taxes
on
the
transfer
of
marihuana.
there
were
no
taxes
on
the
transfer
of
narcotics
and
there
still
are
not.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
i
would
call
it
a
prohibitory
tax
as
the
constitutional
doctrine
is
developed
on
that.
but
it's
a
tax
which
is
designed
to
end
a
certain
sort
of
conduct
like
the
selling
of
state
bank
notes
or
the
sale
of
yellow
audio
margin.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
not
a
fine,
it's
a
deterrent
rather
than
a
fine
principally.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
well,
all
criminal
statutes
we
can
say
both
deterrent
and
cumulative.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
no,
to
collect
the
tax.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
it's
a
civil
suit
rather
than
a
forfeiture
proceeding
in
form.
and
when
we
say,
“it
comes
up
only
after
you
violate
the
law,”
we're
talking
only
about
a
transfer
set
by
definition
or
illegal.
the
tax
is
due
and
payable
and
it's
paid
at
the
time
the
transfer
or
the
time
of
applying
order
forms
for
lawful
transactions.
i
think
that
we
shouldn't
lose
sight
of
the
fact
either
that
the
regulations
which
the
court
has
frequently
held
especially
when
dating
from
the
time
of
enactment
and
when
promulgated
by
the
agencies
which
are
to
give
life
to
a
statute
as
in
this
case
have
from
within
two
months
after
the
passage
of
the
marihuana
act
clearly
indicated
exactly
what
congress
was
intending.
the
regulations
that
were
promulgated
on
this
point
under
the
marihuana
tax
act
are
identical
to
the
regulations
under
the
harrison
act.
and
they
provide
that
only
people
who
are
lawfully
registered
can
obtain
the
order
forms
for
the
lawful
acquisition
of
marihuana.
now,
under
the
marihuana
act,
that
is
the
time
that
the
tax
is
to
be
paid
by
those
who
are
lawfully
entitled
to
obtain
marihuana.
where
counsel
in
the
previous
case
suggested
that
this
was
ingenious
and
noble
construction
that
the
government
invented
only
after
grosso
and
marchetti
and
haynes
suggested
that
there
are
constitutional
difficulties
with
this
statute.
these
regulations
date
from
1937
longer
for
there
was
any
suggestion
that
statutes
which
operate
even
differently
as
the
wagering
and
firearms
statutes
did
involve
fifth
amendment
problems.
this
is
by
no
means
a
noble
inventive
rejoinder
there
to
recent
constitutional
development.
the
administrative
agencies
with
ample
foundation
in
the
legislative
record
including
statements
on
the
floor
of
the
congress
and
in
the
committee
reports
that
this
bill
is
designed
to
stamp
out
illicit
marihuana
transfers
that
it's
designed
to
prevent
marihuana
from
coming
into
the
hands
of
those
who
would
use
it
for
smoking
or
for
addiction.
with
this
type
of
legislative
background,
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
promulgated
regulations
to
effectuate
that
objective.
so
that
the
only
transfers
of
marihuana
that
can
be
made
or
transfers
that
are
lawful
or
to
lawful
registrants
who
are
complying
with
state
law.
these
are
the
only
people
who
are
expected
to
register,
they're
the
only
people
who
were
allowed
to
register,
they're
the
only
people
who
file
information
returns,
they're
the
only
people
whose
names
are
listed
in
forms
that
will
be
made
available
to
state
and
local
investigating
services.
people
who
would
be
in
violation
of
state
law
if
they
handle
marihuana
are
not
allowed
to
get
federal
sanction
for
the
transfer
of
marihuana.
they
are
not
expected
to
register.
this
act
as
to
that
class
of
people
stands
as
an
absolute
prohibition;
that
is
what
congress
understood,
that
is
what
the
regulations
make
clear.
the
standard
for
whether
the
privileges
against
self-incrimination
prevents
prosecution
for
violation
of
statute
focuses
on
whether
compliance
with
the
statute
would
have
presented
real
and
substantial
rather
then
imaginary
hazards
of
self-incrimination.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
no,
sir.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
no,
sir.
let
me
say
that
this
case
follows
a
fortiori
from
cases
that
this
court
has
already
decided
in
doremus,
in
nigro,
in
wong
sing,
and
alston.
this
court
upheld
as
a
legitimate
exercise
of
the
tax
power,
the
absolute
band
provided
in
the
harrison
act
for
transfers
to
non-registrants
even
though
there
is
no
tax
even
on
the
transfer
of
narcotics
under
the
harrison
act.
they
said,
“it
was
enough
to
say
that
these
prohibitions
were
designed
to
keep
the
transfers
above
board
where
the
commodity
tax
was
subject
to
collection.”
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
mr.
chief
justice,
in
answer
to
the
question
that
you
asked
mr.
davis,
the
government
did
argue
that
and
cert
that
transfers
of
--
illicit
transfers
of
marihuana
are
taxable
civilly.
on
page
17,
of
the
buff
colored
appendix
where
in
pertinent
part
are
motion
for
reconsideration
in
the
district
court
is
set
forth
footnote
3
says
after
saying
that
it's
impossible
to
prepay
the
tax
and
to
obtain
an
order
form
if
the
perspective
transferee
is
a
non-registrant.
of
course,
the
government
is
not
foreclosed
in
collecting
the
$100.00
tax
after
it
has
been
established
that
a
transfer
was
made
to
an
unregistered
person.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
well,
there
are
737
grams
which
is
approximately
29
ounces
of
marihuana.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
i‘m
not
sure
what
the
$2.75
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
well,
that's
because
the
demand
apparently
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
just
a
matter
of
days.
i
think
the
indictment
says
the
transaction
took
place
on
august
11
and
the
indictment
was
returned
in
november,
so
it's
a
matter
of
few
days.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
as
far
as
i
know
your
honor,
i
do
not.
i
believe
the
demand
form
that
is
referring
to
is
a
standard
demand
for
production
which
triggers
the
penal
provisions
of
section
4744.
it
is
provided
for
in
the
statute
like
this.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
i
think
it's
important
to
turn
to
the
contention
that
the
regulations
and
the
statute
themselves
belie
the
government's
contention.
counsel
for
mr.
leary
has
just
said
that
the
only
thing
we
have
is
a
statement
in
the
regulations
at
the
signatures
on
the
application
for
registration.
and
the
signature
on
the
application
for
order
forms
will
be
compared
but
that
that's
only
designed
to
make
sure
that
people
aren't
evading
the
$100.00
tax
in
trying
to
bring
themselves
under
the
$1.00
per
ounce
tax.
i
think
if
the
court
looks
at
the
regulation,
it
will
see
that
it
is
much
more
expressed.
regulation
26
cfr
152.68
which
is
set
forth
on
page
60
of
the
leary
brief,
after
saying
that
upon
receipt
of
the
application
for
an
order
form
the
district
director
will
compare
it
with
the
signature
appearing
on
the
application
for
registration.
it
then
says
unless
the
district
director
is
satisfied
that
the
application
is
authentic,
it
will
not
be
honored.
now,
we
can
see
no
other
reasonable
construction
of
this
regulation
and
that
the
signature
is
the
authentic
signature
of
the
registrant.
the
order
form
will
--
the
application
for
an
order
form
will
not
be
honored
unless
it
has
been
submitted
by
someone
who
is
duly
registered.
counselor
also
points
to
the
provision
dealing
with
application
for
order
forms,
he,
i
think
misspoke
inadvertently
when
he
said
that
the
order
form
is
to
contain
the
name
of
the
transferee
if
registered.
it's
the
application
for
the
order
form,
its
26
cfr
152.66.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
no,
he
cannot
come
in
and
pay
the
$100.00
transfer
tax
at
all.
the
district
director
would
be
behaving
in
contravention
of
the
treasury
regulations
if
he
accept
the
tax
and
issue
the
order
forms.
the
regulations
expressly
forbid
him
to
issue
an
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
no,
sir.
it's
our
contention
that
order
forms
are
not
available
to
any
non-registrants.
only
non-registrants
are
subject
to
the
$100.00
tax.
so,
that
in
operation
since
1937,
no
one
has
and
no
one
can
pay
prepay
the
$100.00.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
that's
right.
after
the
transfer,
the
illicit
transfer
has
taken
place.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
i
would
call
it
consistent
administration
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
that's
essentially
our
argument
that
we
say
it's
been
interpreted
that
way
for
30
years.
it
also
has
the
incidental
virtue
which
is
by
no
means
a
post
talk
rationalization
in
light
for
the
third
year
history
of
avoiding
not
insubstantial
constitutional
doubts
and
normally,
the
court
will
interpret
statutes
if
fairly
possible
as
we
think
the
administrative
construction
and
the
reports
make
more
than
fairly
possible.
to
avoid
constitutional
doubts,
it's
a
noble
doctrine
that
the
contention
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
well,
we're
dealing
in
a
noble
area
mr.
justice.
in
marchetti
and
grosso,
we
talked
about
substantial
hazards
of
incrimination.
we
say
that
under
this
statute
there
are
no
substantial
hazards
of
incrimination
whether
the
regulations
are
ultra
vires,
we
contend
they're
not.
but
even
if
they
are,
for
30
years,
there
has
been
no
substantial
hazard
of
incrimination
because
no
one
has
been
expected
to
come
forward
and
make
a
disclosure
which
could
be
incriminatory.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
i
think
that
would
raise
the
question
whether
the
regulations
are
ultra
vires.
but
no
one
has
ever
done
that.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
we
would
be
prepared
to
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
our
contention
is
that
the
act
does
not
say
that
that
congress
didn't
mean
that
and
the
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
that's
right.
congress
has
provided
a
direct
--
congress
has
provided
a
direct
prohibition
upon
his
acquisition
of
marihuana
for
a
man
can't
commit
murder
by
coming
in
to
the
government
saying,
“i'm
going
to
tell
you
about
it,
but
i
want
to
commit
murder.”
well,
congress
outlawed
the
acquisition
of
marihuana
and
even
if
the
individual
wanted
to
come
forward
and
waive
his
privilege,
congress
has
said
that
he
is
just
not
eligible
to
engage
in
marihuana
transactions
without
more.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
before
i
begin
the
statement
of
the
covington
case
which
is
now
being
considered,
i'd
like
to
clear
up
a
misapprehension
which
maybe
left
with
the
court.
the
tax
imposed
on
the
transfer
of
marihuana
to
a
non-registrant
is
$100.00
per
ounce
or
fraction
thereof.
so,
while
it
is
possible
according
to
bureau
of
narcotics
statistics
to
obtain
between
85
and
100
cigarettes
from
each
ounce
of
marihuana.
the
transfer
of
even
of
a
cigarette
which
would
have
perhaps
100
of
an
ounce
would
still
be
subject
to
a
$100.00
tax
because
any
transfer
of
marihuana
no
matter
how
is
like
if
to
a
non-registrant
is
subject
to
the
$100.00
tax.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes,
that
is
a
matter
of
public
record.
in
the
fiscal
year
1967
that
would
be
july
1,
1966
through
january
--
through
june
30,
1967,
$177,000.00
was
collected
under
the
marihuana
tax
act.
for
calendar
year
1967,
the
figure
is
about
$270,000.00.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
this
is
all
revenue
collected
under
the
tax.
it
includes
the
special
occupational
tax
and
the
transfer
taxes
in
amounts
of
$1.00
and
$100.00.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
no,
sir.
absolutely
not
in
our
brief.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
if
you
are
not
eligible
to
comply
with
state
law,
you
cannot
register
with
the
director
of
internal
revenue
under
the
marihuana
tax
act.
it
is
our
contention
that
if
you're
not
eligible
for
federal
registration
you
cannot
prepay
the
tax
or
obtain
federal
order
points.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
not
always
after
conviction
but
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
--
after
the
transfer
--
the
illegal
transfer
has
taken
place,
the
sanchez
case
before
this
court.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
the
tax
is
levied
by
an
assessment.
i'm
not
aware
of
any
situation
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
in
the
civil
suit,
yes.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
there
is
absolutely,
yes.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
i'm
not
sure
whether
the
50%
surcharge
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes,
there
would
be
6%
interest.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
well,
i
think
there's
a
very
critical
distinction
in
grosso.
the
individual
was
required
to
come
forward
and
pay
the
tax
on
his
own
initiative
and
he
fail
to
do
so,
he
was
subject
to
criminal
prosecution.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
in
this
situation,
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
if
the
government
bears
the
burden
of
proof,
there
is
nothing
even
in
grosso.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
no,
there
is
no
additional
criminal
violation.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
mr.
justice,
there
is
no
additional
criminal
violation
in
not
paying
the
tax
after
the
transaction
has
occurred
and
the
way
the
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes,
and
the
government
is
not
punishing
him
for
failing
to
waive
his
fifth
amendment
right.
the
government
is
saying,
“we
have
information
that
you
illegally
obtained
marihuana.
that
is
a
taxable
transaction
for
which
you
are
liable.”
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
the
same
could
be
said
about
an
embezzler
who
fails
to
report
the
proceeds
of
an
embezzlement
on
his
income
tax
return
if
the
government
and
it
brings
a
civil
suit
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
we're
not
willing
to
suggest
that
the
income
tax
is
fatally
a
suspect.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
well,
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
in
practical
effect,
we
suggest
that
there
really
is
no
fifth
amendment
difference
in
this
situation.
the
penalty
that's
being
imposed
in
the
civil
assessment
is
something
that
the
court
expressly
in
grosso
and
marchetti
and
haynes
said
was
allowable.
the
court
expressly
said
the
tax
is
not
invalid
in
these
situations
and
the
government
can
take
steps
to
collect
it
civilly.
the
only
thing
that
the
government
may
not
do
is
prosecute
a
man
criminally
for
not
having
come
forward
to
pay
the
tax.
this
act
is
different
from
the
firearms
and
the
wagering
tax
acts
because
as
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
you
don't.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
you
obtained
it
illegally.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
but
what
we're
saying
is
that
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
well,
mr.
justice,
i
have
to
reiterate
that
the
way
the
statute
was
drafted
and
the
way
it's
been
interpreted
under
the
regulations
for
the
past
30
years
and
illegal
acquisition
the
person
who
acquires
marihuana
illegally
that
is
in
most
situation
someone
who
was
a
non-registrant
is
not
expected
to
come
forward
and
pay
the
tax.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
if
the
government
brings
suit
against
him
and
a
judgment
is
rendered
establishing
his
civil
liability
then
the
tax
is
collected
as
any
assessment
is.
but,
it
was
never
contemplated
by
congress
in
the
administrative
agencies
have
never
expected.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes,
that
the
statute
doesn't
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
statute
that
is
involved
here
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
no,
sir.
what
we
contend
the
statute
says
and
what
it
means
is
that
any
transfer,
any
receipt
of
marihuana
by
an
individual
who
cannot
obtain
federal
authority
for
it
is
a
criminal
offense
because
the
tax
is
said
up
in
a
way
to
make
it
a
crime
for
a
person
in
the
course
of
taxable
transaction
to
obtain
marihuana
without
the
authority
to
obtain
it.
there
are
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
well,
i
don't
suggest
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
no,
congress
wrote
the
criminal
statute.
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
both
briefs
the
clear
legislative
history
indicating
that
congress
did
intend
to
achieve
an
absolute
prohibition
upon
any
transfers
of
marihuana
except
in
what
this
court
in
sanchez
called
legitimate
medicinal
scientific
and
industrial
channels.
because
there
have
been
four
dissents
in
doremus
and
three
dissents
in
nigro
about
the
ability
of
congress
to
enact
the
complete
prohibition
on
illicit
transfers
without
using
the
tax
power.
and
i
think
it's
important
to
know
that
there
is
no
transfer
tax
under
the
harrison
act
and
that
was
why
the
dissents
in
those
two
cases
had
set
congress,
there's
no
legitimate
relation
between
an
attempt
to
distinguish
law
from
unlawful
transactions.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
that's
right
and
that's
why
congress
indemonstrably
trying
to
achieve
the
same
result
making
it
the
crime
to
transfer
marihuana.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
because
of
the
--
then
doubts
about
the
constitutional
power.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
no,
sir.
in
this
situation,
congress
imposed
to
taxes
on
the
transfer
of
marihuana.
there
were
no
taxes
on
the
transfer
of
narcotics
and
there
still
are
not.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
i
would
call
it
a
prohibitory
tax
as
the
constitutional
doctrine
is
developed
on
that.
but
it's
a
tax
which
is
designed
to
end
a
certain
sort
of
conduct
like
the
selling
of
state
bank
notes
or
the
sale
of
yellow
audio
margin.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
not
a
fine,
it's
a
deterrent
rather
than
a
fine
principally.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
well,
all
criminal
statutes
we
can
say
both
deterrent
and
cumulative.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
no,
to
collect
the
tax.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
it's
a
civil
suit
rather
than
a
forfeiture
proceeding
in
form.
and
when
we
say,
“it
comes
up
only
after
you
violate
the
law,”
we're
talking
only
about
a
transfer
set
by
definition
or
illegal.
the
tax
is
due
and
payable
and
it's
paid
at
the
time
the
transfer
or
the
time
of
applying
order
forms
for
lawful
transactions.
i
think
that
we
shouldn't
lose
sight
of
the
fact
either
that
the
regulations
which
the
court
has
frequently
held
especially
when
dating
from
the
time
of
enactment
and
when
promulgated
by
the
agencies
which
are
to
give
life
to
a
statute
as
in
this
case
have
from
within
two
months
after
the
passage
of
the
marihuana
act
clearly
indicated
exactly
what
congress
was
intending.
the
regulations
that
were
promulgated
on
this
point
under
the
marihuana
tax
act
are
identical
to
the
regulations
under
the
harrison
act.
and
they
provide
that
only
people
who
are
lawfully
registered
can
obtain
the
order
forms
for
the
lawful
acquisition
of
marihuana.
now,
under
the
marihuana
act,
that
is
the
time
that
the
tax
is
to
be
paid
by
those
who
are
lawfully
entitled
to
obtain
marihuana.
where
counsel
in
the
previous
case
suggested
that
this
was
ingenious
and
noble
construction
that
the
government
invented
only
after
grosso
and
marchetti
and
haynes
suggested
that
there
are
constitutional
difficulties
with
this
statute.
these
regulations
date
from
1937
longer
for
there
was
any
suggestion
that
statutes
which
operate
even
differently
as
the
wagering
and
firearms
statutes
did
involve
fifth
amendment
problems.
this
is
by
no
means
a
noble
inventive
rejoinder
there
to
recent
constitutional
development.
the
administrative
agencies
with
ample
foundation
in
the
legislative
record
including
statements
on
the
floor
of
the
congress
and
in
the
committee
reports
that
this
bill
is
designed
to
stamp
out
illicit
marihuana
transfers
that
it's
designed
to
prevent
marihuana
from
coming
into
the
hands
of
those
who
would
use
it
for
smoking
or
for
addiction.
with
this
type
of
legislative
background,
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
promulgated
regulations
to
effectuate
that
objective.
so
that
the
only
transfers
of
marihuana
that
can
be
made
or
transfers
that
are
lawful
or
to
lawful
registrants
who
are
complying
with
state
law.
these
are
the
only
people
who
are
expected
to
register,
they're
the
only
people
who
were
allowed
to
register,
they're
the
only
people
who
file
information
returns,
they're
the
only
people
whose
names
are
listed
in
forms
that
will
be
made
available
to
state
and
local
investigating
services.
people
who
would
be
in
violation
of
state
law
if
they
handle
marihuana
are
not
allowed
to
get
federal
sanction
for
the
transfer
of
marihuana.
they
are
not
expected
to
register.
this
act
as
to
that
class
of
people
stands
as
an
absolute
prohibition;
that
is
what
congress
understood,
that
is
what
the
regulations
make
clear.
the
standard
for
whether
the
privileges
against
self-incrimination
prevents
prosecution
for
violation
of
statute
focuses
on
whether
compliance
with
the
statute
would
have
presented
real
and
substantial
rather
then
imaginary
hazards
of
self-incrimination.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
no,
sir.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
no,
sir.
let
me
say
that
this
case
follows
a
fortiori
from
cases
that
this
court
has
already
decided
in
doremus,
in
nigro,
in
wong
sing,
and
alston.
this
court
upheld
as
a
legitimate
exercise
of
the
tax
power,
the
absolute
band
provided
in
the
harrison
act
for
transfers
to
non-registrants
even
though
there
is
no
tax
even
on
the
transfer
of
narcotics
under
the
harrison
act.
they
said,
“it
was
enough
to
say
that
these
prohibitions
were
designed
to
keep
the
transfers
above
board
where
the
commodity
tax
was
subject
to
collection.”
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
mr.
chief
justice,
in
answer
to
the
question
that
you
asked
mr.
davis,
the
government
did
argue
that
and
cert
that
transfers
of
--
illicit
transfers
of
marihuana
are
taxable
civilly.
on
page
17,
of
the
buff
colored
appendix
where
in
pertinent
part
are
motion
for
reconsideration
in
the
district
court
is
set
forth
footnote
3
says
after
saying
that
it's
impossible
to
prepay
the
tax
and
to
obtain
an
order
form
if
the
perspective
transferee
is
a
non-registrant.
of
course,
the
government
is
not
foreclosed
in
collecting
the
$100.00
tax
after
it
has
been
established
that
a
transfer
was
made
to
an
unregistered
person.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
well,
there
are
737
grams
which
is
approximately
29
ounces
of
marihuana.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
i‘m
not
sure
what
the
$2.75
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
well,
that's
because
the
demand
apparently
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
just
a
matter
of
days.
i
think
the
indictment
says
the
transaction
took
place
on
august
11
and
the
indictment
was
returned
in
november,
so
it's
a
matter
of
few
days.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
as
far
as
i
know
your
honor,
i
do
not.
i
believe
the
demand
form
that
is
referring
to
is
a
standard
demand
for
production
which
triggers
the
penal
provisions
of
section
4744.
it
is
provided
for
in
the
statute
like
this.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
i
think
it's
important
to
turn
to
the
contention
that
the
regulations
and
the
statute
themselves
belie
the
government's
contention.
counsel
for
mr.
leary
has
just
said
that
the
only
thing
we
have
is
a
statement
in
the
regulations
at
the
signatures
on
the
application
for
registration.
and
the
signature
on
the
application
for
order
forms
will
be
compared
but
that
that's
only
designed
to
make
sure
that
people
aren't
evading
the
$100.00
tax
in
trying
to
bring
themselves
under
the
$1.00
per
ounce
tax.
i
think
if
the
court
looks
at
the
regulation,
it
will
see
that
it
is
much
more
expressed.
regulation
26
cfr
152.68
which
is
set
forth
on
page
60
of
the
leary
brief,
after
saying
that
upon
receipt
of
the
application
for
an
order
form
the
district
director
will
compare
it
with
the
signature
appearing
on
the
application
for
registration.
it
then
says
unless
the
district
director
is
satisfied
that
the
application
is
authentic,
it
will
not
be
honored.
now,
we
can
see
no
other
reasonable
construction
of
this
regulation
and
that
the
signature
is
the
authentic
signature
of
the
registrant.
the
order
form
will
--
the
application
for
an
order
form
will
not
be
honored
unless
it
has
been
submitted
by
someone
who
is
duly
registered.
counselor
also
points
to
the
provision
dealing
with
application
for
order
forms,
he,
i
think
misspoke
inadvertently
when
he
said
that
the
order
form
is
to
contain
the
name
of
the
transferee
if
registered.
it's
the
application
for
the
order
form,
its
26
cfr
152.66.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
no,
he
cannot
come
in
and
pay
the
$100.00
transfer
tax
at
all.
the
district
director
would
be
behaving
in
contravention
of
the
treasury
regulations
if
he
accept
the
tax
and
issue
the
order
forms.
the
regulations
expressly
forbid
him
to
issue
an
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
no,
sir.
it's
our
contention
that
order
forms
are
not
available
to
any
non-registrants.
only
non-registrants
are
subject
to
the
$100.00
tax.
so,
that
in
operation
since
1937,
no
one
has
and
no
one
can
pay
prepay
the
$100.00.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
that's
right.
after
the
transfer,
the
illicit
transfer
has
taken
place.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
i
would
call
it
consistent
administration
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
that's
essentially
our
argument
that
we
say
it's
been
interpreted
that
way
for
30
years.
it
also
has
the
incidental
virtue
which
is
by
no
means
a
post
talk
rationalization
in
light
for
the
third
year
history
of
avoiding
not
insubstantial
constitutional
doubts
and
normally,
the
court
will
interpret
statutes
if
fairly
possible
as
we
think
the
administrative
construction
and
the
reports
make
more
than
fairly
possible.
to
avoid
constitutional
doubts,
it's
a
noble
doctrine
that
the
contention
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
well,
we're
dealing
in
a
noble
area
mr.
justice.
in
marchetti
and
grosso,
we
talked
about
substantial
hazards
of
incrimination.
we
say
that
under
this
statute
there
are
no
substantial
hazards
of
incrimination
whether
the
regulations
are
ultra
vires,
we
contend
they're
not.
but
even
if
they
are,
for
30
years,
there
has
been
no
substantial
hazard
of
incrimination
because
no
one
has
been
expected
to
come
forward
and
make
a
disclosure
which
could
be
incriminatory.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
i
think
that
would
raise
the
question
whether
the
regulations
are
ultra
vires.
but
no
one
has
ever
done
that.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
we
would
be
prepared
to
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
our
contention
is
that
the
act
does
not
say
that
that
congress
didn't
mean
that
and
the
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
that's
right.
congress
has
provided
a
direct
--
congress
has
provided
a
direct
prohibition
upon
his
acquisition
of
marihuana
for
a
man
can't
commit
murder
by
coming
in
to
the
government
saying,
“i'm
going
to
tell
you
about
it,
but
i
want
to
commit
murder.”
well,
congress
outlawed
the
acquisition
of
marihuana
and
even
if
the
individual
wanted
to
come
forward
and
waive
his
privilege,
congress
has
said
that
he
is
just
not
eligible
to
engage
in
marihuana
transactions
without
more.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes,
sir.
