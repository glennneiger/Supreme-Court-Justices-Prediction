mr.
william
j.
davis
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice
and
all
of
the
members
of
the
court,
i
have
not
been
admitted
to
the
supreme
court
bar
and
i
would
request
that
i
be
admitted
for
the
purpose
of
this
suit
since
i
have
been
appointed
by
the
court
to
represent
the
indigent.
i
hope
to
prefect
my
membership
that
--
mr.
william
j.
davis
thank
you.
first,
i
want
to
apologize
to
the
clerk's
office
and
the
court
for
any
problems
arising
in
the
--
my
presentation
of
this
case.
probable
cause
was
noted
in
october
of
1968
and
i
was
at
that
time
notified
that
because
of
the
leary
case
was
coming
up
at
the
same
time
it
was
desirable
that
this
case
be
argued
at
the
same
time
and
i
was
asked
if
i
could
meet
the
deadline.
i
was
reluctant
to
try
to
meet
the
deadline
because
i
am
somewhat
of
anachronism
i
run
a
one-man
law
office
and
i
--
however,
felt
the
importance
of
this
case
and
i
took,
almost
took
on
more
than
like
two.
i
–
we
manage
--
did
manage
to
get
in
a
brief
and
it
is
a
brief,
brief.
i
do
not
apologize
for
the
brevity
of
the
brief
but
i
do
apologize
for
the
small
print
because
like
my
texas
colleague
yesterday
i'd
like
to
say
that
the
brief
only
cost
about
$1.10
a
copy.
so,
we
did
save
some
money
but
it
might
have
to
be
use
with
microscope
in
order
to
read,
the
print
it
is
so
small.
it
is
my
hope
that
i
can
amend
for
this
in
my
oral
presentation
of
this
case.
now,
the
covington
case
which
is
before
you
delineates
the
very
shocking
the
question
of
the
tax
because
as
the
government
admits
and
i
was
of
course
counsel
below
as
the
government
admits,
we
interpose
our
objection
to
the
statute
in
the
time
of
the
matter.
my
client
was
indicted
on
or
about
august
well
in
september
of
1967
or
sometime
thereafter
and
the
indictment
read
as
follows,
“united
states
of
america
versus
henry
preston
covington
that
on
or
about
august
11,
1967
within
the
eastern
district
of
the
southern
district
of
ohio,
henry
preston
covington
being
a
transferee
of
marihuana
required
to
pay
the
tax
imposed
by
title
26,
united
states
code
section
4741
(a)
did
acquire
and
obtain
approximately
737.1
grams
of
marihuana
without
having
paid
such
tax
period
in
violation
of
26
united
states
code
4744
(a)
(1).”
to
this
indictment,
we
interpose
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
indictment
on
the
grounds
that
the
statute
compel
--
would
compel
the
defendant
to
incriminate
himself.
we
had
--
this
was
not
accidental
that
we
raise
this.
we
have
been
following
the
costello
case
as
in
the
gambling
cases
in
the
advance
sheets
and
we
were
waiting
for
the
decisions
to
be
reached.
unfortunately
for
us,
the
decisions
were
reached
before
the
indict
--
before
we
had
to
answer
the
indictment
and
when
the,
not
only
because
when
the
cases
came
out,
haynes,
marchetti,
and
grosso
and
the
same
volume
of
the
law
editions
we
relied
on
these
cases
to
meet
this.
so,
to
answer
to
mr.
justice
stewart's
question
of
yesterday
as
to
the
time
of
the
case,
our
case
did
come
after
haynes,
marchetti
and
grosso
so
that
would
be
no
problem
of
retroactivity
if
the
court
desire
to
follow
its
decisions
in
those
cases.
of
course,
one
of
the
things
that
impelled
us
to
make
the
objection
to
the
statute
and
i
think
one
of
the
things
that
influenced
the
federal
judge,
judge
joseph
p.
kinneary
in
sustaining
our
motion
was
the
dissent
of
the
chief
justice
in
the
grosso
case
in
which
he
said
that,
“i
apprehended
the
court
by
a
necessarily
sweeping
within
its
constitutional
requirements,
the
registration
requirements
within
its
constitutional
holding
the
registration
requirements
of
4412
is
opening
a
door
to
a
new
waive
of
a
tax
on
a
number
of
federal
registration
statutes
wherever
the
registration
requirement
touches
upon
allegedly
illegal
activities.
and
of
course
the
4722,
those
engaged
in
dealing
in
narcotic
drugs
4753,
those
who
deal
in
marihuana
were
included
in
the
chief
justice's
enumeration
of
the
statutes
which
might
be
affected
by
this
decision.
we
realize
of
course
that
chief
justice
which
this
time
was
concerned
about
the
effect
that
these
decisions
had
on
the
power
to
tax
and
we
of
course
would
share
that
concern.
however,
it's
no
question
about
that
these
decisions
did
open
the
door.
and
we're
trying
to
get
in
it.
might
i
say
that
insofar
as
civil
liability
is
concerned
and
i
might
say
this
reference
to
the
questions
that
have
been
asked
by
mr.
justice
fortas
and
mr.
justice
stewart,
the
--
i'm
sorry,
white.
this
law
is
no
joke
to
my
client.
my
client
was
served
a
notice
by
a
narcotic
agent
and
the
notice
was
directed
to
him
to
henry
preston
covington
and
it
says
this
is
from
a
narcotic
agent
jack
elloy
in
ohio
in
case
in
ohio
782m
which
is
either
his
narcotic
case
file
number
or
the
internal
revenue
file
number.
“it
has
been
reported
to
the
undersigned
officially
that
on
or
about
11
day
of
august
1967
at
columbus
ohio
and
eastern
division,
southern
district
of
ohio
you
were
found
with
a
quantity
of
marihuana
in
your
possession
and
under
your
control.
accordingly,
and
in
pursuant
to
the
provisions
of
section
4744,
the
internal
revenue
code
of
1954,
i
hereby
demand
that
within
eight
days
from
the
service
hereof
upon
you,
you
produce
at
my
office
in
room
1045
in
the
federal
office
building
cleveland,
ohio
a
copy
of
the
official
order
form”
that's
in
caps
“required
by
section
4742
of
the
internal
revenue
code
of
1954
to
be
retained
by
you
under
and
by
virtue
of
which
said
marihuana
was
transferred
to
and
applied
by
you.
you
are
further
notified
that
your
failure
to
comply
herewith
within
the
period
specified
will
render
you
liable
for
the
transfer
of
taxes
imposed
by
section
4741
of
the
internal
revenue
code
of
1954
and
will
establish
presumptively
that
you
acquired
and
obtained
said
marihuana
unlawfully
without
having
paid
such
taxes.”
so,
contrary
to
the
government's
argument
that
this
is
a
lot
of
more
lucky,
these
people
are
following
this
statute.
it
is
a
tax
statute
and
they
are
observing
it
as
such.
mr.
william
j.
davis
no,
sir.
i
refer
to
it
in
my
brief,
in
my
brief,
brief
but
i
don't
believe
i
attest
a
copy
of
this.
i
might
have
attest
a
copy
in
the
record.
mr.
william
j.
davis
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
j.
davis
i'll
--
i'll
leave
the
original.
it
appears
to
be
a
copy
of
an
original.
i
can
leave
it
with
the
court
and
i
think
perhaps
since
the
government's
argument
is
taking
the
turn
that
it
is
that
this
should
be
by
the
record,
if
it's
not
all
ready
i
referred
to
it
in
my
brief.
i
did
not
realize
we
will
get
in
to
the
argument
of
civil
liability.
and
in
addition,
i
have
--
mr.
william
j.
davis
yes,
thank
you
sir.
in
addition,
my
client
has
been
served
with
a
form
17
from
the
internal
revenue
office
dated
at
cincinnati
ohio
the
district
dated
october
11,
1967
notifying
him
that
he
has
been
taxed
a
reference
and
date
number
4
marihuana
that
the
assessment
is
$2,900.00
and
that
is
--
it's
a
$2.75
special
tax
and
there
is
28
cents
interest
and
the
total
tax
due
is
$2,903.03.
so,
this
is
no
joke
to
my
client
because
in
addition
he
had
a
--
mr.
william
j.
davis
no,
sir.
that
is
not
in
the
record
at
all.
i
didn't
mention
it
in
the
record.
mr.
william
j.
davis
sir?
mr.
william
j.
davis
just
the
fact
that
this
order
was
--
that
this
order
was
served
on
him,
the
order
from
the
internal
revenue
or
from
the
narcotic
agent
notifying
him
that
he
should
comply
with
the
statute.
mr.
william
j.
davis
sir?
mr.
william
j.
davis
yes,
this
is
an
official
notice
and
--
mr.
william
j.
davis
i
--
we,
--
the
case
below
was
decided
on
memorandum
solely
and
i
do
not
recall
a
civil
liability
being
raised
in
the
memorandum.
it
was
the
memorandum
below
of
the
government
was
primarily
on
this
question
of
the
administrative
construction
of
this
act
to
the
effect
that
no
person
who
was
illegally
engaged
in
the
transfer
of
marihuana
could
obtain
an
order
form
but
there
was
no
question
of
civil
liability.
of
course,
these
are
things
outside
the
record,
in
addition,
my
client's
car
was
impounded
66,
65
buick.
so,
it's
very
real,
this
man
is
very
real
that
him
and
because
the
impounding
of
the
car
was
not
under
the
statute.
so,
it's
a
very
real
to
him.
now,
we
feel
therefore
that
we
are
strictly
following
judicial
precedent
and
we
feel
the
court
--
the
lower
court,
district
court
took
a
forthright
stand
and
we
feel
that
haynes,
grosso,
and
marchetti
required
that
the
striking
down
of
the
statutory
scheme
such
as
this
which
constructs
a
federal
crime
upon
failure
to
make
a
compelled
disclosure
of
activity
clearly
criminal
and
even
though
it's
in
a
tax
or
in
a
statute.
we
--
we
note
that
the
haynes,
grosso,
marchetti
decisions
merely
extended
the
albertson
decision
which
struck
down
a
registration
oriented
criminal
statute
which
the
two
purpose
was
to
direct
it
to
a
selective
group
inherently
suspect
of
criminal
activities.
again,
we
emphasize
the
fact
that
our
case
came
after
the
haynes,
grosso
and
marchetti
case.
i
might
also
indicate
one
of
the
statements
that
was
made
by
a
federal
judge
below.
after
the
judge
had
struck
down
the
statute
and
construed
the
statute
to
be
unconstitutional
as
applied
to
this
defendant,
covington,
the
government
again
asked
for
reconsideration.
and
on
reconsideration,
it
emphasizes
argument
that
this
man
could've
obtained
the
narcotic
and
therefore
the
tax
doesn't
apply
to
him.
the
court
below
rule
made
an
alternative
ruling
in
addition
to
ruling
that
that
the
statute
compelled
self-incrimination.
the
court
answered
the
government's
argument
in
the
following
manner
and
he
said,
“the
memorandum
filed
in
support
of
this
motion
submits
that
a
person
who
is
a
transferee
of
marihuana
in
violation
of
state
laws
will
not
be
issued
an
order
form
for
marihuana.
it
is
asserted
this
reads
the
statute
of
any
trace
of
unconstitutionality.”
this
court
did
not
decide
that
the
marihuana
taxing
provision
are
in
themselves
unconstitutionally.
it
merely
determined
that
as
applied
to
this
defendant,
they
would
be
unconstitutional.
if
the
defendant
had
no
obligation
to
pay
the
tax
and
obtain
an
order
form,
the
united
states
had
no
basis
on
which
to
seek
an
indictment.
the
court
does
not
agree
that
section
4744,
the
statute
under
which
this
defendant
was
indicted
is
now
an
absolute
prohibition.
section
4744
is
based
explicitly
on
section
4741
(a).
if
4741
(a)
is
not
applicable
to
the
defendant,
then
there
is
no
basis
for
the
indictment.
therefore,
in
any
event
the
indictment
should
be
dismissed.
we
feel
that
this
is
a
commendable
construction
of
the
answer
to
the
government's
argument.
and
we
feel
that
it
is
too
late
now
for
laws
to
be
change
by
administrative
fiat.
normally,
the
administrator
is
trying
to
read
more
things
into
the
law.
here,
in
this
case,
the
government
is
trying
to
read
something
out
of
the
law.
this
law
says,
“all
persons”
and
we
feel
therefore
that
this
law
compels
incrimination
insofar
as
covington
was
concerned
and
that
as
to
him
it
was
an
unconstitutional
attempt
to
compel
him
to
incriminate
himself.
thank
you.

it
is
my

that

this

now,
the
covington
case
which
is
before

delineates
the
very
shocking
the
question
of
the
tax
because
as
the
government
admits
and
i
was

counsel
below
as
the
government
admits,
we
interpose
our
objection
to
the

my
client
was
indicted
on

about

in

of

or
sometime

and
the
indictment
read
as
follows,

to
this
indictment,
we
interpose
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
indictment
on
the
grounds
that
the
statute
compel
--
would
compel
the
defendant
to
incriminate

we
had
--
this
was
not
accidental
that
we
raise
this.
we

as
in
the

in

and
we
were

for

unfortunately
for
us,
the
decisions
were
reached
before
the
indict

before
we
had
to
answer
the
indictment
and
when
the,
not
only
because
when
the

haynes,
marchetti,

and
the

so,
to
answer
to

as

our
case
did

that
would
be
no
problem
of
retroactivity
if
the
court
desire
to
follow
its
decisions
in
those
cases.
of
course,
one
of
the
things
that
impelled
us
to
make
the
objection
to
the
statute
and
i
think
one
of
the
things
that
influenced
the
federal
judge,
judge
joseph
p.
kinneary
in
sustaining
our
motion
was
the
dissent
of
the
chief
justice
in
the
grosso
case
in
which
he
said
that,
“i
apprehended
the
court
by
a
necessarily
sweeping
within
its
constitutional
requirements,
the
registration
requirements
within
its
constitutional
holding
the
registration
requirements
of
4412
is
opening
a
door
to
a
new
waive
of
a
tax
on
a
number
of
federal
registration
statutes
wherever
the
registration
requirement
touches
upon
allegedly
illegal
activities.
and
of
course
the
4722,
those
engaged
in
dealing
in
narcotic
drugs
4753,
those
who
deal
in
marihuana
were
included
in
the
chief
justice's
enumeration
of
the
statutes
which
might
be
affected
by
this
decision.
we
realize
of
course
that
chief
justice
which
this
time
was
concerned
about
the
effect
that
these
decisions
had
on
the
power
to
tax
and
we
of
course
would
share
that
concern.
however,
it's
no
question
about
that
these
decisions
did
open
the
door.
and
we're
trying
to
get
in
it.
might
i
say
that
insofar
as
civil
liability
is
concerned
and
i
might
say
this
reference
to
the
questions
that
have
been
asked
by
mr.
justice
fortas
and
mr.
justice
stewart,
the
--
i'm
sorry,
white.
this
law
is
no
joke
to
my
client.
my
client
was
served
a
notice
by
a
narcotic
agent
and
the
notice
was
directed
to
him
to
henry
preston
covington
and
it
says
this
is
from
a
narcotic
agent
jack
elloy
in
ohio
in
case
in
ohio
782m
which
is
either
his
narcotic
case
file
number
or
the
internal
revenue
file
number.
“it
has
been
reported
to
the
undersigned
officially
that
on
or
about
11
day
of
august
1967
at
columbus
ohio
and
eastern
division,
southern
district
of
ohio
you
were
found
with
a
quantity
of
marihuana
in
your
possession
and
under
your
control.
accordingly,
and
in
pursuant
to
the
provisions
of
section
4744,
the
internal
revenue
code
of
1954,
i
hereby
demand
that
within
eight
days
from
the
service
hereof
upon
you,
you
produce
at
my
office
in
room
1045
in
the
federal
office
building
cleveland,
ohio
a
copy
of
the
official
order
form”
that's
in
caps
“required
by
section
4742
of
the
internal
revenue
code
of
1954
to
be
retained
by
you
under
and
by
virtue
of
which
said
marihuana
was
transferred
to
and
applied
by
you.
you
are
further
notified
that
your
failure
to
comply
herewith
within
the
period
specified
will
render
you
liable
for
the
transfer
of
taxes
imposed
by
section
4741
of
the
internal
revenue
code
of
1954
and
will
establish
presumptively
that
you
acquired
and
obtained
said
marihuana
unlawfully
without
having
paid
such
taxes.”
so,
contrary
to
the
government's
argument
that
this
is
a
lot
of
more
lucky,
these
people
are
following
this
statute.
it
is
a
tax
statute
and
they
are
observing
it
as
such.
mr.
william
j.
davis
no,
sir.
i
refer
to
it
in
my
brief,
in
my
brief,
brief
but
i
don't
believe
i
attest
a
copy
of
this.
i
might
have
attest
a
copy
in
the
record.
mr.
william
j.
davis
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
j.
davis
i'll
--
i'll
leave
the
original.
it
appears
to
be
a
copy
of
an
original.
i
can
leave
it
with
the
court
and
i
think
perhaps
since
the
government's
argument
is
taking
the
turn
that
it
is
that
this
should
be
by
the
record,
if
it's
not
all
ready
i
referred
to
it
in
my
brief.
i
did
not
realize
we
will
get
in
to
the
argument
of
civil
liability.
and
in
addition,
i
have
--
mr.
william
j.
davis
yes,
thank
you
sir.
in
addition,
my
client
has
been
served
with
a
form
17
from
the
internal
revenue
office
dated
at
cincinnati
ohio
the
district
dated
october
11,
1967
notifying
him
that
he
has
been
taxed
a
reference
and
date
number
4
marihuana
that
the
assessment
is
$2,900.00
and
that
is
--
it's
a
$2.75
special
tax
and
there
is
28
cents
interest
and
the
total
tax
due
is
$2,903.03.
so,
this
is
no
joke
to
my
client
because
in
addition
he
had
a
--
mr.
william
j.
davis
no,
sir.
that
is
not
in
the
record
at
all.
i
didn't
mention
it
in
the
record.
mr.
william
j.
davis
sir?
mr.
william
j.
davis
just
the
fact
that
this
order
was
--
that
this
order
was
served
on
him,
the
order
from
the
internal
revenue
or
from
the
narcotic
agent
notifying
him
that
he
should
comply
with
the
statute.
mr.
william
j.
davis
sir?
mr.
william
j.
davis
yes,
this
is
an
official
notice
and
--
mr.
william
j.
davis
i
--
we,
--
the
case
below
was
decided
on
memorandum
solely
and
i
do
not
recall
a
civil
liability
being
raised
in
the
memorandum.
it
was
the
memorandum
below
of
the
government
was
primarily
on
this
question
of
the
administrative
construction
of
this
act
to
the
effect
that
no
person
who
was
illegally
engaged
in
the
transfer
of
marihuana
could
obtain
an
order
form
but
there
was
no
question
of
civil
liability.
of
course,
these
are
things
outside
the
record,
in
addition,
my
client's
car
was
impounded
66,
65
buick.
so,
it's
very
real,
this
man
is
very
real
that
him
and
because
the
impounding
of
the
car
was
not
under
the
statute.
so,
it's
a
very
real
to
him.
now,
we
feel
therefore
that
we
are
strictly
following
judicial
precedent
and
we
feel
the
court
--
the
lower
court,
district
court
took
a
forthright
stand
and
we
feel
that
haynes,
grosso,
and
marchetti
required
that
the
striking
down
of
the
statutory
scheme
such
as
this
which
constructs
a
federal
crime
upon
failure
to
make
a
compelled
disclosure
of
activity
clearly
criminal
and
even
though
it's
in
a
tax
or
in
a
statute.
we
--
we
note
that
the
haynes,
grosso,
marchetti
decisions
merely
extended
the
albertson
decision
which
struck
down
a
registration
oriented
criminal
statute
which
the
two
purpose
was
to
direct
it
to
a
selective
group
inherently
suspect
of
criminal
activities.
again,
we
emphasize
the
fact
that
our
case
came
after
the
haynes,
grosso
and
marchetti
case.
i
might
also
indicate
one
of
the
statements
that
was
made
by
a
federal
judge
below.
after
the
judge
had
struck
down
the
statute
and
construed
the
statute
to
be
unconstitutional
as
applied
to
this
defendant,
covington,
the
government
again
asked
for
reconsideration.
and
on
reconsideration,
it
emphasizes
argument
that
this
man
could've
obtained
the
narcotic
and
therefore
the
tax
doesn't
apply
to
him.
the
court
below
rule
made
an
alternative
ruling
in
addition
to
ruling
that
that
the
statute
compelled
self-incrimination.
the
court
answered
the
government's
argument
in
the
following
manner
and
he
said,
“the
memorandum
filed
in
support
of
this
motion
submits
that
a
person
who
is
a
transferee
of
marihuana
in
violation
of
state
laws
will
not
be
issued
an
order
form
for
marihuana.
it
is
asserted
this
reads
the
statute
of
any
trace
of
unconstitutionality.”
this
court
did
not
decide
that
the
marihuana
taxing
provision
are
in
themselves
unconstitutionally.
it
merely
determined
that
as
applied
to
this
defendant,
they
would
be
unconstitutional.
if
the
defendant
had
no
obligation
to
pay
the
tax
and
obtain
an
order
form,
the
united
states
had
no
basis
on
which
to
seek
an
indictment.
the
court
does
not
agree
that
section
4744,
the
statute
under
which
this
defendant
was
indicted
is
now
an
absolute
prohibition.
section
4744
is
based
explicitly
on
section
4741
(a).
if
4741
(a)
is
not
applicable
to
the
defendant,
then
there
is
no
basis
for
the
indictment.
therefore,
in
any
event
the
indictment
should
be
dismissed.
we
feel
that
this
is
a
commendable
construction
of
the
answer
to
the
government's
argument.
and
we
feel
that
it
is
too
late
now
for
laws
to
be
change
by
administrative
fiat.
normally,
the
administrator
is
trying
to
read
more
things
into
the
law.
here,
in
this
case,
the
government
is
trying
to
read
something
out
of
the
law.
this
law
says,
“all
persons”
and
we
feel
therefore
that
this
law
compels
incrimination
insofar
as
covington
was
concerned
and
that
as
to
him
it
was
an
unconstitutional
attempt
to
compel
him
to
incriminate
himself.
thank
you.
i
would
defer
i
think
they
have
some
time
left
to
my
colleague
mr.
haft.
