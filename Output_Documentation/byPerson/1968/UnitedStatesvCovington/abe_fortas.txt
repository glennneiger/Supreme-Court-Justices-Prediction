justice
abe
fortas
there
is
nothing
except
this
tax
law
that
prohibits
it.
you're
saying
on
the
one
hand
that
the
tax
law
is
sort
of
a
joke
and
on
the
other
hand,
you're
saying
that
man
who
violates
it
commits
a
criminal
offense.
justice
abe
fortas
but
i
don't,
is
there
anything
else
other
than
the
violation
of
the
tax
law
that
is
involved
here?
we
say
this
tax
law
doesn't
exist
if
we
look
at
it
as
if
it
didn't
exist
here
didn't
mean
what
it
says
wasn't
counsel
in
the
preceding
case
correct
that
we
--
what
you're
really
doing
is
asking
us
to
write
a
criminal
statute?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
if
that
were
so
then
you
would
have
to
defend
the
statute,
wouldn't
you
on
some
power
--
constitutional
power
of
the
congress
rather
than
the
taxing
power?
justice
abe
fortas
in
other
words,
what
you're
saying
is
that
this
taxing
statute
here
is
not
in
reality
a
tax
statute,
it's
a
prohibitory
statute
but
that
we
should
regard
the
taxing
power
as
a
constitutional
basis
for
the
congressional
prohibition?
justice
abe
fortas
but
a
while
ago,
you
told
us
that
congress
didn't
follow
the
harrison
act
model
here
in
order
to
avoid
the
frightful
prospect
presented
by
the
fact
that
they
were
in
dissents
in
doremus.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
davis,
is
what
you
just
read
to
us
in
the
record
before
us?
justice
abe
fortas
there's
a
copy
of
the
--
you're
reading
from
an
official
notice?
justice
abe
fortas
is
copy
of
that
available?
justice
abe
fortas
can
somebody
apply
for
him
and
obtain
the
$100.00
--
go
in
and
pay
the
$100.00
tax
in
applying
for
him
and
obtain
the
permit
with
assurance
that
the
information
listed
will
not
be
used
either
to
institute
a
criminal
investigation
or
as
evidence
in
a
criminal
prosecution?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
apart
from
that
suppose
where
the
--
somebody
could
take
a
--
could
issue
a
permit
to
$100.00
upon
payment
of
a
$100.00
tax
in
a
proper
case?
justice
abe
fortas
so,
the
money
that's
been
collected
--
has
been
collected
and
on
the
$100.00
tax
has
been
collected
in
the
absence
of
the
insurance
of
an
order
form?
justice
abe
fortas
and
what
you're
asking
us
to
do
is
to
go
along
with
this
--
what
shall
i
call
it?
well,
i
won't
--
justice
abe
fortas
(voice
overlap)
we'll
go
along
with
this
straight
statutory
scheme
that
you
say
should
be
read
as
saying,
“thou
shalt
not?”
justice
abe
fortas
it's
a
little
difficult
to
think
of
something
where
the
court
has
--
the
party
is
quite
as
far
as
you're
suggesting
from
the
language
of
the
statute?
justice

there
is
nothing
