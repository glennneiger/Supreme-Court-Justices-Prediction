mr.
milford
j.
meyer
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
presents
a
constitutional
challenge
to
the
power
of
the
courts
of
appeals
to
review
the
denial
by
the
districts
courts
of
motions
for
new
trial
on
the
ground
that
verdicts
are
excessive.
this
was
an
action
in
the
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
new
york
under
the
federal
employers'
liability
act.
it
was
tried
in
two
parts.
in
the
first
trial,
the
jury
found
the
liability
of
the
railroad
to
its
employee.
a
separate
trial
then
was
held
in
which
the
amount
of
the
damages
was
fixed
by
the
jury.
judgment
was
entered
upon
the
total
verdict
and
on
the
railroad's
motions
for
new
trial
the
district
judge
dismissed
all
of
its
objections
on
the
record
as
to
matters
of
evidence
and
as
to
the
specific
argument
that
the
verdict
was
excessive.
the
trial
judge
carefully
reviewed
all
of
the
evidence
that
had
been
produced
none
of
which
was
controverted
and
found
that
an
opinion
which
appears
in
the
appendix
that
the
verdict
was
fully
justified
by
the
evidence.
on
appeal
to
the
second
circuit,
two
judges
of
that
court
found
as
did
the
third
that
there
was
no
merit
in
the
railroad’s
other
arguments
on
error
in
the
trial
but
reached
the
conclusion
that
the
verdict
was
grossly
excessive
and
directed
a
new
trial
unless
a
remittitur
be
filed.
the
third
judge
who
sat
on
the
case
disagreed.
he
found
that
the
verdict
was
sustained
by
the
evidence
and
the
court
should
not
have
disturbed
it.
we
go
directly
to
the
constitutional
question
of
whether
the
court
of
appeals
had
the
power
to
make
this
order.
the
seventh
amendment
was
passed
upon
as
early
as
1830
by
chief
justice
marshall’s
court
in
an
opinion
by
justice
story
in
parsons
v.
bedford
in
which
this
court
specifically
denied
to
itself
the
power
to
review
questions
of
fact
which
had
been
passed
upon
and
approved
by
the
trial
courts.
and
that
was
the
law
until
1879
when
the
specific
question
here
involved
was
first
raised
in
railroad
against
fraloff
when
this
court
in
an
opinion
by
justice
harlan
specifically
held
that
it
had
no
power
to
review
the
excessiveness
of
a
verdict
found
to
be
proper
by
the
district
court.
when
the
circuit
courts,
now
the
courts
of
appeals
were
created
certainly
they
obtain
no
greater
power
of
review
than
this
court
when
it
itself
was
passing
upon
appeals
from
the
district
courts.
and
the
history
of
the
circuits
in
the
early
days
was
early
acceptance
of
this
rule
which
had
been
promulgated
by
this
court
that
there
was
no
power
under
the
seventh
amendment
to
interfere
on
the
basis
of
the
excessiveness
of
a
verdict.
that
early
acceptance
gradually
in
the
circuits
one
after
another
passed
to
arguments
which
constituted
a
rationalization
of
reasons
why
they
should
have
some
power
of
interference.
and
finally
in
the
last
20
years
specifically
beginning
about
1948
each
of
the
courts
of
appeals
has
made
the
statement
that
it
has
the
adherent
power
to
interfere
and
overrule
on
the
basis
of
excessiveness
alone.
now,
the
courts
of
appeals
have
made
three
approaches
to
the
statement
of
this
power
which
they
have
that
the
supreme
court
did
not
have
when
it
was
hearing
appeals
itself.
first,
some
of
the
courts
of
appeals
have
said
that
the
common
law
history
which
was
looked
to
by
the
seventh
amendment
does
not
support
the
position
that
the
early
judges
of
this
court
took
on
these
questions.
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
when
we
look
to
the
history
of
the
common
law
procedure
before
1791
when
the
amendment
was
adopted
that
the
british
courts
did
in
fact
review
in
sort
of
an
appellant
procedure
the
qualm
of
a
verdict
as
well
as
the
weight
of
evidence.
this
i
think
is
completely
erroneous
and
has
no
basis
whatsoever.
it
is
based
entirely
on
the
fact
that
the
english
court
of
queen’s
bench
decided
en
banc
motions
for
a
new
trial
which
may
have
been
tried
before
one
of
their
judges
at
the
assizes.
but
justice
story
in
the
parsons
against
bedford
case
realized
that
as
well
as
did
all
of
the
early
judges
of
this
court
when
he
said
that
there
could
be
no
review
of
questions
of
fact
except
in
the
court
in
which
the
case
was
tried
or
to
which
it
was
returned.
certainly,
recognizing
the
fact
that
queen’s
bench
sat
as
a
court
en
banc,
and
so
any
rationalization
that
the
court
of
appeals
today
is
like
westminster
sitting
in
queen’s
bench
en
banc
because
some
of
the
history
books
tells
us
sometimes
the
trial
judge
did
not
sit
in
the
court
en
banc
certainly
has
no
basis
historically.
the
fact
is
and
the
writers
have
said
and
we
have
studied
everyone
of
the
cases
which
have
been
referred
to
by
any
of
the
courts
of
appeals
there
is
no
case
reported
prior
to
1791
in
the
english
books
in
which
a
new
trial
was
granted
except
for
error
of
law
in
which
the
trial
judge
did
not
sit
at
westminster
upon
the
hearing
of
the
motion.
now,
a
second
tact
that
has
been
taken
and
was
taken
by
the
second
circuit
in
the
early
cases
upon
which
our
court
relied
was
that
true
it
is
and
this
court
has
held
that
a
review
of
the
quantum
of
the
evidence
may
not
ordinarily
be
made
by
an
appellant
court
under
the
seventh
amendment
because
this
is
the
review
of
a
question
of
fact
and
that
this
court
has
said
time
and
time
again.
but
said
the
second
circuit
and
others
following
it,
there
must
be
an
upper
limit
that
is
a
verdict
maybe
somewhat
excessive
we
cannot
interfere
but
it
may
reach
an
upper
limit
at
which
the
question
then
becomes
one
of
law
and
not
one
of
fact.
then
says
the
court,
we
do
not
review
that
were
verdict
which
the
seventh
amendment
forbids
us
from
going,
we
review
the
discretion
of
the
trial
judge
in
passing
upon
that
verdict.
no
effort
is
made
by
any
of
the
courts
of
appeals
to
explain
how
this
question
of
fact,
the
excessiveness
of
a
verdict
is
transmuted
into
a
question
of
law
by
saying
we
are
not
reviewing
the
verdict
we
are
reviewing
the
discretion
of
a
trial
judge
and
whether
he
has
abused
that
discretion.
and
if
that
be
true,
that
discretion
may
be
reviewed
and
they
be
set
aside
because
of
abuse
on
what
basis
should
it
be
made.
this
has
never
been
explained
by
any
of
the
courts
of
appeals
except
to
say
each
case
must
be
decided
on
its
own
facts.
we
will
not
review
for
mere
excessiveness,
but
this
particular
case
looks
like
one
in
which
the
trial
judge
was
way
out
of
line
even
though
he
saw
the
witnesses,
he
heard
them,
he
heard
all
the
evidence
he
was
in
a
much
better
position
that
we,
nevertheless,
he
was
so
far
out
of
line
that
we
say
he
abused
his
discretion
and
that
then
becomes
a
question
of
law,
but
with
no
explanation
as
to
how
this
maybe
transmuted
into
a
question
of
law
and
come
outside
the
purview
of
the
seventh
amendment.
and
the
third
rationalization
has
been
that
modern
times
require
a
reinterpretation
of
the
seventh
amendment
and
that
this
prohibition
against
the
review
of
question
of
fact
in
modern
times
must
be
reexamined.
and
since
this
court
has
gone
so
far
as
to
say
the
changes
in
practice,
changes
in
methods
of
an
appeal,
changes
in
pleadings
need
not
be
prohibited
and
we
need
not
follow
common
law
procedures.
that
therefore
the
seventh
amendment
may
now
be
reinterpreted
and
we
may
now
say
that
although
ordinarily
questions
of
facts
may
not
be
reviewed
after
the
trial
judge
has
approved
them.
that
in
this
type
of
case
where
there
is
an
excessiveness
involved
this
is
an
exception
and
that
this
court
should
now
reinterpret
the
amendment
to
say
that
here
we
will
permit
it.
this
court
has
never
done.
the
courts
of
appeals
have
on
various
occasions
look
to
some
of
the
expressions
that
this
court
has
made
in
refusing
to
pass
on
this
question
since
1879;
the
latest
one
being
in
the
neese
against
southern
railway
in
1955
where
the
specific
question
was
post
on
a
precisely
similar
situation.
and
what
this
court
said
there
was,
we
will
not
reach
at
this
time
the
constitutional
question
because
reviewing
the
record
we
cannot
say
that
this
verdict
was
not
without
supporting
the
record,
and
therefore
reversed
the
fourth
circuit
without
going
to
the
constitutional
question
and
that
may
well
be
the
position
which
this
court
will
decide
to
take
in
this
case,
because
as
we
have
pointed
out,
there
is
no
justification
in
fact
for
the
interference
by
the
seventh
circuit
with
this
verdict.
there
is
no
justification
in
fact
for
the
second
circuit
in
a
vote
of
two
judges
to
one
to
decide
that
the
trial
judge
who
saw
the
witnesses
and
heard
the
evidence
abused
his
discretion
in
permitting
this
verdict
to
stand.
the
second
circuit
majority
did
not
even
take
the
trouble
to
review
in
its
opinion
the
evidence
to
determine
whether
in
the
language
of
this
court
in
the
neese
case
this
verdict
was
without
support
in
the
record.
it
contended
itself
with
saying
that
this
verdict
that
appears
to
us
is
grossly
excessive
and
it
used
another
phrase
which
is
difficult
to
rationalize
it
all.
it
said
that
we
cannot
find
ourselves,
and
i'm
paraphrasing
i
don’t
have
the
precise
words
before
me,
able
to
reach
a
verdict
greater
than
so
much
and
therefore
directed
a
remittitur.
the
verdict
in
this
case
was
$305,000.00.
trial
judge
found
it
to
be
fully
justified
by
the
record
and
so
did
the
dissenting
judge
on
the
second
circuit.
the
two
judges
joined
in
the
majority
opinion
said
that
they
could
not
find
themselves
able
to
justify
a
verdict
beyond
$200,000.00
and
directed
a
remittitur
to
the
amount
or
else
a
new
trial.
now,
if
your
honors
at
this
time
as
you
did
in
neese
feel
that
this
case
does
not
present
a
question
that
must
be
decided
that
fraloff
and
parsons
against
bedford
may
stand
as
they
should
until
another
case
comes
along.
we
are
perfectly
satisfied
of
course
but
if
there
is
any
right
of
review
that
this
court
is
willing
to
leave
with
the
courts
of
appeals
it
cannot
be
on
such
a
subjective
basis
as
two
judges
feel
that
this
is
grossly
excessive
while
the
trial
judge
and
the
other
judge
on
the
court
of
appeals
feels
that
it’s
perfectly
proper.
there
must
be
some
objective
treatment
of
this
question
and
not
this
subjective
approach
to
what
is
an
excessive,
what
is
grossly
excessive,
what
is
monstrous
if
this
is
to
be
the
judgment
upon
which
the
courts
of
appeals
are
to
base
their
decisions
reviewing
these
questions.
we
have
raised
one
other
question
in
our
brief
which
i
think
your
honors
will
not
require
me
to
orally
argue
and
that
goes
only
to
this
second
question
that
i
have
discussed.
this
was
an
action
under
the
federal
employers’
liability
act
and
certainly
as
this
court
has
said
time
and
time
again
the
right
of
a
jury
trial
and
the
right
to
have
the
jury
verdict
in
violate
as
part
and
partial
of
that
act,
so
that
if
in
any
case
a
verdict
of
a
jury
as
to
amount
sustained
by
the
trial
judge
should
be
sustained
it
is
in
a
case
under
the
act.
mr.
chief
justice
i
would
like
to
reserve
whatever
i
may
need.
mr.
milford
j.
meyer
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
i
would
be
perfectly
willing
to
retry
this
case
before
this
jury
if
that
is
the
railroad’s
position
here.
i
don’t
think
that
we
should
have
to
retry
a
case
in
the
court
of
appeals
on
damages
and
then
the
supreme
court
on
damages
and
that's
precisely
what
counsel
for
the
railroad
here
is
contending
that
we
must
justify
now
before
this
court
that
its
members
would
determine
what
was
the
proper
amount
that
should
be
awarded.
this
was
the
particular
purpose
of
the
seventh
amendment
when
it
was
passed
that
this
should
not
occur
in
the
supreme
court
or
in
any
appellate
court
in
the
united
states.
now,
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
answer
a
few
of
the
questions
that
were
asked
and
some
of
them
maybe
very
relevant.
a
question
was
asked
by
mr.
justice
harlan
i
believe
as
to
how
long
the
case
took
the
trial.
that
appears
in
the
docket
entries
it
started
on
february
21
and
ended
on
march
2.
now,
that
doesn’t
tell
the
whole
story
of
course
because
february
22
was
a
holiday
and
i'm
sure
there
was
a
weekend
involved.
i
know
that
i
went
back
and
forth
in
philadelphia
many
days
to
try
the
case.
the
question
was
asked
by
mr.
justice
black
as
to
the
practice
in
pennsylvania
with
which
of
course
i
am
very
familiar.
and
that
carried
out
the
common
law
practice.
it
still
does.
a
case
tried
by
a
single
judge,
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
is
heard
by
the
three
judges
of
which
he
was
a
member
of
the
panel
unless
it
is
waived.
but
that
question
is
not
new
to
this
court.
this
court
had
the
same
question
before
it
in
metropolitan
against
moore
when
the
question
arose
as
to
whether
the
general
sessions
of
the
then
supreme
court
to
the
district
of
columbia
was
the
same
court
as
the
special
session
that
tried
the
case.
and
that
was
precisely
what
you
had
in
england
as
mr.
justice
black
pointed
out.
you
have
one
judge
sitting
in
assize
and
the
motions
for
new
trial
came
to
westminster
and
he
sat
there
with
his
colleagues
the
three
others
and
they
decided
the
case
that's
what
this
court
said
was
not
an
appellate
review
in
metropolitan
against
moore
in
the
general
sessions
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
district
of
columbia.
now,
finally,
i
suppose
i
must
make
an
answer
to
the
question
asked
by
mr.
justice
harlan
as
to
the
ad
damnum.
the
court
of
appeals
said
in
its
opinion
although
it
did
not
discuss
or
try
to
justify
in
any
way
it’s
cutting
down
the
verdict,
it
did
say
that
the
fact
of
the
ad
damnum
claim
less
than
the
amount
awarded
to
the
jury
has
some
significance
according
to
its
language.
what
significance
it
doesn’t
say?
well,
let's
examine
it
for
just
a
moment.
what's
significance?
this
man
was
injured
in
1962
and
this
action
was
started
in
1963
and
it
didn’t
come
to
trial
until
1967.
the
ad
damnum
was
fixed
in
1963.
it
wasn’t
amended
until
after
the
trial
and
at
that
time
it
was
amended
with
leave
of
court
and
there
is
no
contest
by
the
railroad
that
that
isn’t
proper.
it’s
been
done
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
times
and
has
always
been
held
to
be
proper.
but
the
important
point
is
this
and
the
court
of
appeals
recognized
is
it
and
the
record
shows
it.
the
ad
damnum
clause
was
never
mentioned
to
the
jury.
the
jury
never
saw
the
complaint.
the
jury
was
on
its
own
on
the
facts
to
determine
the
amount
that
should
be
awarded.
now,
where
my
friend
gets
this
figure
of
$126,000.00
i
do
not
know.
it
is
not
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals.
the
figure
that
the
lower
court
mentions
was
$155,000.00.
we
have
indicate
plus
$27,000.00
which
would
be
$182,000.00.
we
have
indicated
in
our
brief
that
they
very
may
well
have
awarded
$192,000.00
without
going
--
stretching
themselves
one
bit
for
loss
of
future
earnings
and
as
mr.
justice
marshall
just
said
the
only
question
here
is
how
much
of
the
jury
of
awarded
for
this
man’s
pain
and
suffering.
is
this
court
going
to
decide
that
because
if
the
courts
of
appeals
are
to
decide
that
purely
on
the
basis
that
this
is
grossly
excessive
then
mustn’t
this
court
also
determine
whether
the
court
of
appeals
has
abused
its
discretion
in
deciding
that
the
court
below
has
abused
its
discretion
on
this
issue.
i
like
particularly
also
something
that
judge
leonard
hand
said
but
in
this
specific
connection
and
i
have
it
on
my
brief
in
discussing
this
type
of
review
they
call
the
attention
of
the
fact
that
court
of
appeals
must
come
at
the
matter
ones
removed
not
in
the
position
of
the
trial
judge.
and
he
said,
“we
must
in
effect
decide
whether
it
was
within
the
bounds
of
tolerable
conclusion
to
say
that
the
jury’s
verdict
was
within
the
bounds
of
tolerable
conclusion.”
to
decide
cases
by
such
tenuous
unrealities
it
seems
to
us
thoroughly
undesirable.
parties
ought
not
to
be
bound
by
gossip
or
strands,
judges
ought
not
to
engage
in
scholastic
refinements
and
that’s
precisely
what
the
court
below
has
done
here.
mr.
milford
j.
meyer
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
presents
a
constitutional
challenge
to
the
power
of
the
courts
of
appeals
to
review
the
denial
by
the
districts
courts
of
motions
for
new
trial
on
the
ground
that
verdicts
are
excessive.
this
was
an
action
in
the
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
new
york
under
the
federal
employers'
liability
act.
it
was
tried
in
two
parts.
in
the
first
trial,
the
jury
found
the
liability
of
the
railroad
to
its
employee.
a
separate
trial
then
was
held
in
which
the
amount
of
the
damages
was
fixed
by
the
jury.
judgment
was
entered
upon
the
total
verdict
and
on
the
railroad's
motions
for
new
trial
the
district
judge
dismissed
all
of
its
objections
on
the
record
as
to
matters
of
evidence
and
as
to
the
specific
argument
that
the
verdict
was
excessive.
the
trial
judge
carefully
reviewed
all
of
the
evidence
that
had
been
produced
none
of
which
was
controverted
and
found
that
an
opinion
which
appears
in
the
appendix
that
the
verdict
was
fully
justified
by
the
evidence.
on
appeal
to
the
second
circuit,
two
judges
of
that
court
found
as
did
the
third
that
there
was
no
merit
in
the
railroad’s
other
arguments
on
error
in
the
trial
but
reached
the
conclusion
that
the
verdict
was
grossly
excessive
and
directed
a
new
trial
unless
a
remittitur
be
filed.
the
third
judge
who
sat
on
the
case
disagreed.
he
found
that
the
verdict
was
sustained
by
the
evidence
and
the
court
should
not
have
disturbed
it.
we
go
directly
to
the
constitutional
question
of
whether
the
court
of
appeals
had
the
power
to
make
this
order.
the
seventh
amendment
was
passed
upon
as
early
as
1830
by
chief
justice
marshall’s
court
in
an
opinion
by
justice
story
in
parsons
v.
bedford
in
which
this
court
specifically
denied
to
itself
the
power
to
review
questions
of
fact
which
had
been
passed
upon
and
approved
by
the
trial
courts.
and
that
was
the
law
until
1879
when
the
specific
question
here
involved
was
first
raised
in
railroad
against
fraloff
when
this
court
in
an
opinion
by
justice
harlan
specifically
held
that
it
had
no
power
to
review
the
excessiveness
of
a
verdict
found
to
be
proper
by
the
district
court.
when
the
circuit
courts,
now
the
courts
of
appeals
were
created
certainly
they
obtain
no
greater
power
of
review
than
this
court
when
it
itself
was
passing
upon
appeals
from
the
district
courts.
and
the
history
of
the
circuits
in
the
early
days
was
early
acceptance
of
this
rule
which
had
been
promulgated
by
this
court
that
there
was
no
power
under
the
seventh
amendment
to
interfere
on
the
basis
of
the
excessiveness
of
a
verdict.
that
early
acceptance
gradually
in
the
circuits
one
after
another
passed
to
arguments
which
constituted
a
rationalization
of
reasons
why
they
should
have
some
power
of
interference.
and
finally
in
the
last
20
years
specifically
beginning
about
1948
each
of
the
courts
of
appeals
has
made
the
statement
that
it
has
the
adherent
power
to
interfere
and
overrule
on
the
basis
of
excessiveness
alone.
now,
the
courts
of
appeals
have
made
three
approaches
to
the
statement
of
this
power
which
they
have
that
the
supreme
court
did
not
have
when
it
was
hearing
appeals
itself.
first,
some
of
the
courts
of
appeals
have
said
that
the
common
law
history
which
was
looked
to
by
the
seventh
amendment
does
not
support
the
position
that
the
early
judges
of
this
court
took
on
these
questions.
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
when
we
look
to
the
history
of
the
common
law
procedure
before
1791
when
the
amendment
was
adopted
that
the
british
courts
did
in
fact
review
in
sort
of
an
appellant
procedure
the
qualm
of
a
verdict
as
well
as
the
weight
of
evidence.
this
i
think
is
completely
erroneous
and
has
no
basis
whatsoever.
it
is
based
entirely
on
the
fact
that
the
english
court
of
queen’s
bench
decided
en
banc
motions
for
a
new
trial
which
may
have
been
tried
before
one
of
their
judges
at
the
assizes.
but
justice
story
in
the
parsons
against
bedford
case
realized
that
as
well
as
did
all
of
the
early
judges
of
this
court
when
he
said
that
there
could
be
no
review
of
questions
of
fact
except
in
the
court
in
which
the
case
was
tried
or
to
which
it
was
returned.
certainly,
recognizing
the
fact
that
queen’s
bench
sat
as
a
court
en
banc,
and
so
any
rationalization
that
the
court
of
appeals
today
is
like
westminster
sitting
in
queen’s
bench
en
banc
because
some
of
the
history
books
tells
us
sometimes
the
trial
judge
did
not
sit
in
the
court
en
banc
certainly
has
no
basis
historically.
the
fact
is
and
the
writers
have
said
and
we
have
studied
everyone
of
the
cases
which
have
been
referred
to
by
any
of
the
courts
of
appeals
there
is
no
case
reported
prior
to
1791
in
the
english
books
in
which
a
new
trial
was
granted
except
for
error
of
law
in
which
the
trial
judge
did
not
sit
at
westminster
upon
the
hearing
of
the
motion.
now,
a
second
tact
that
has
been
taken
and
was
taken
by
the
second
circuit
in
the
early
cases
upon
which
our
court
relied
was
that
true
it
is
and
this
court
has
held
that
a
review
of
the
quantum
of
the
evidence
may
not
ordinarily
be
made
by
an
appellant
court
under
the
seventh
amendment
because
this
is
the
review
of
a
question
of
fact
and
that
this
court
has
said
time
and
time
again.
but
said
the
second
circuit
and
others
following
it,
there
must
be
an
upper
limit
that
is
a
verdict
maybe
somewhat
excessive
we
cannot
interfere
but
it
may
reach
an
upper
limit
at
which
the
question
then
becomes
one
of
law
and
not
one
of
fact.
then
says
the
court,
we
do
not
review
that
were
verdict
which
the
seventh
amendment
forbids
us
from
going,
we
review
the
discretion
of
the
trial
judge
in
passing
upon
that
verdict.
no
effort
is
made
by
any
of
the
courts
of
appeals
to
explain
how
this
question
of
fact,
the
excessiveness
of
a
verdict
is
transmuted
into
a
question
of
law
by
saying
we
are
not
reviewing
the
verdict
we
are
reviewing
the
discretion
of
a
trial
judge
and
whether
he
has
abused
that
discretion.
and
if
that
be
true,
that
discretion
may
be
reviewed
and
they
be
set
aside
because
of
abuse
on
what
basis
should
it
be
made.
this
has
never
been
explained
by
any
of
the
courts
of
appeals
except
to
say
each
case
must
be
decided
on
its
own
facts.
we
will
not
review
for
mere
excessiveness,
but
this
particular
case
looks
like
one
in
which
the
trial
judge
was
way
out
of
line
even
though
he
saw
the
witnesses,
he
heard
them,
he
heard
all
the
evidence
he
was
in
a
much
better
position
that
we,
nevertheless,
he
was
so
far
out
of
line
that
we
say
he
abused
his
discretion
and
that
then
becomes
a
question
of
law,
but
with
no
explanation
as
to
how
this
maybe
transmuted
into
a
question
of
law
and
come
outside
the
purview
of
the
seventh
amendment.
and
the
third
rationalization
has
been
that
modern
times
require
a
reinterpretation
of
the
seventh
amendment
and
that
this
prohibition
against
the
review
of
question
of
fact
in
modern
times
must
be
reexamined.
and
since
this
court
has
gone
so
far
as
to
say
the
changes
in
practice,
changes
in
methods
of
an
appeal,
changes
in
pleadings
need
not
be
prohibited
and
we
need
not
follow
common
law
procedures.
that
therefore
the
seventh
amendment
may
now
be
reinterpreted
and
we
may
now
say
that
although
ordinarily
questions
of
facts
may
not
be
reviewed
after
the
trial
judge
has
approved
them.
that
in
this
type
of
case
where
there
is
an
excessiveness
involved
this
is
an
exception
and
that
this
court
should
now
reinterpret
the
amendment
to
say
that
here
we
will
permit
it.
this
court
has
never
done.
the
courts
of
appeals
have
on
various
occasions
look
to
some
of
the
expressions
that
this
court
has
made
in
refusing
to
pass
on
this
question
since
1879;
the
latest
one
being
in
the
neese
against
southern
railway
in
1955
where
the
specific
question
was
post
on
a
precisely
similar
situation.
and
what
this
court
said
there
was,
we
will
not
reach
at
this
time
the
constitutional
question
because
reviewing
the
record
we
cannot
say
that
this
verdict
was
not
without
supporting
the
record,
and
therefore
reversed
the
fourth
circuit
without
going
to
the
constitutional
question
and
that
may
well
be
the
position
which
this
court
will
decide
to
take
in
this
case,
because
as
we
have
pointed
out,
there
is
no
justification
in
fact
for
the
interference
by
the
seventh
circuit
with
this
verdict.
there
is
no
justification
in
fact
for
the
second
circuit
in
a
vote
of
two
judges
to
one
to
decide
that
the
trial
judge
who
saw
the
witnesses
and
heard
the
evidence
abused
his
discretion
in
permitting
this
verdict
to
stand.
the
second
circuit
majority
did
not
even
take
the
trouble
to
review
in
its
opinion
the
evidence
to
determine
whether
in
the
language
of
this
court
in
the
neese
case
this
verdict
was
without
support
in
the
record.
it
contended
itself
with
saying
that
this
verdict
that
appears
to
us
is
grossly
excessive
and
it
used
another
phrase
which
is
difficult
to
rationalize
it
all.
it
said
that
we
cannot
find
ourselves,
and
i'm
paraphrasing
i
don’t
have
the
precise
words
before
me,
able
to
reach
a
verdict
greater
than
so
much
and
therefore
directed
a
remittitur.
the
verdict
in
this
case
was
$305,000.00.
trial
judge
found
it
to
be
fully
justified
by
the
record
and
so
did
the
dissenting
judge
on
the
second
circuit.
the
two
judges
joined
in
the
majority
opinion
said
that
they
could
not
find
themselves
able
to
justify
a
verdict
beyond
$200,000.00
and
directed
a
remittitur
to
the
amount
or
else
a
new
trial.
now,
if
your
honors
at
this
time
as
you
did
in
neese
feel
that
this
case
does
not
present
a
question
that
must
be
decided
that
fraloff
and
parsons
against
bedford
may
stand
as
they
should
until
another
case
comes
along.
we
are
perfectly
satisfied
of
course
but
if
there
is
any
right
of
review
that
this
court
is
willing
to
leave
with
the
courts
of
appeals
it
cannot
be
on
such
a
subjective
basis
as
two
judges
feel
that
this
is
grossly
excessive
while
the
trial
judge
and
the
other
judge
on
the
court
of
appeals
feels
that
it’s
perfectly
proper.
there
must
be
some
objective
treatment
of
this
question
and
not
this
subjective
approach
to
what
is
an
excessive,
what
is
grossly
excessive,
what
is
monstrous
if
this
is
to
be
the
judgment
upon
which
the
courts
of
appeals
are
to
base
their
decisions
reviewing
these
questions.
we
have
raised
one
other
question
in
our
brief
which
i
think
your
honors
will
not
require
me
to
orally
argue
and
that
goes
only
to
this
second
question
that
i
have
discussed.
this
was
an
action
under
the
federal
employers’
liability
act
and
certainly
as
this
court
has
said
time
and
time
again
the
right
of
a
jury
trial
and
the
right
to
have
the
jury
verdict
in
violate
as
part
and
partial
of
that
act,
so
that
if
in
any
case
a
verdict
of
a
jury
as
to
amount
sustained
by
the
trial
judge
should
be
sustained
it
is
in
a
case
under
the
act.
mr.
chief
justice
i
would
like
to
reserve
whatever
i
may
need.
mr.
milford
j.
meyer
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
i
would
be
perfectly
willing
to
retry
this
case
before
this
jury
if
that
is
the
railroad’s
position
here.
i
don’t
think
that
we
should
have
to
retry
a
case
in
the
court
of
appeals
on
damages
and
then
the
supreme
court
on
damages
and
that's
precisely
what
counsel
for
the
railroad
here
is
contending
that
we
must
justify
now
before
this
court
that
its
members
would
determine
what
was
the
proper
amount
that
should
be
awarded.
this
was
the
particular
purpose
of
the
seventh
amendment
when
it
was
passed
that
this
should
not
occur
in
the
supreme
court
or
in
any
appellate
court
in
the
united
states.
now,
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
answer
a
few
of
the
questions
that
were
asked
and
some
of
them
maybe
very
relevant.
a
question
was
asked
by
mr.
justice
harlan
i
believe
as
to
how
long
the
case
took
the
trial.
that
appears
in
the
docket
entries
it
started
on
february
21
and
ended
on
march
2.
now,
that
doesn’t
tell
the
whole
story
of
course
because
february
22
was
a
holiday
and
i'm
sure
there
was
a
weekend
involved.
i
know
that
i
went
back
and
forth
in
philadelphia
many
days
to
try
the
case.
the
question
was
asked
by
mr.
justice
black
as
to
the
practice
in
pennsylvania
with
which
of
course
i
am
very
familiar.
and
that
carried
out
the
common
law
practice.
it
still
does.
a
case
tried
by
a
single
judge,
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
is
heard
by
the
three
judges
of
which
he
was
a
member
of
the
panel
unless
it
is
waived.
but
that
question
is
not
new
to
this
court.
this
court
had
the
same
question
before
it
in
metropolitan
against
moore
when
the
question
arose
as
to
whether
the
general
sessions
of
the
then
supreme
court
to
the
district
of
columbia
was
the
same
court
as
the
special
session
that
tried
the
case.
and
that
was
precisely
what
you
had
in
england
as
mr.
justice
black
pointed
out.
you
have
one
judge
sitting
in
assize
and
the
motions
for
new
trial
came
to
westminster
and
he
sat
there
with
his
colleagues
the
three
others
and
they
decided
the
case
that's
what
this
court
said
was
not
an
appellate
review
in
metropolitan
against
moore
in
the
general
sessions
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
district
of
columbia.
now,
finally,
i
suppose
i
must
make
an
answer
to
the
question
asked
by
mr.
justice
harlan
as
to
the
ad
damnum.
the
court
of
appeals
said
in
its
opinion
although
it
did
not
discuss
or
try
to
justify
in
any
way
it’s
cutting
down
the
verdict,
it
did
say
that
the
fact
of
the
ad
damnum
claim
less
than
the
amount
awarded
to
the
jury
has
some
significance
according
to
its
language.
what
significance
it
doesn’t
say?
well,
let's
examine
it
for
just
a
moment.
what's
significance?
this
man
was
injured
in
1962
and
this
action
was
started
in
1963
and
it
didn’t
come
to
trial
until
1967.
the
ad
damnum
was
fixed
in
1963.
it
wasn’t
amended
until
after
the
trial
and
at
that
time
it
was
amended
with
leave
of
court
and
there
is
no
contest
by
the
railroad
that
that
isn’t
proper.
it’s
been
done
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
times
and
has
always
been
held
to
be
proper.
but
the
important
point
is
this
and
the
court
of
appeals
recognized
is
it
and
the
record
shows
it.
the
ad
damnum
clause
was
never
mentioned
to
the
jury.
the
jury
never
saw
the
complaint.
the
jury
was
on
its
own
on
the
facts
to
determine
the
amount
that
should
be
awarded.
now,
where
my
friend
gets
this
figure
of
$126,000.00
i
do
not
know.
it
is
not
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals.
the
figure
that
the
lower
court
mentions
was
$155,000.00.
we
have
indicate
plus
$27,000.00
which
would
be
$182,000.00.
we
have
indicated
in
our
brief
that
they
very
may
well
have
awarded
$192,000.00
without
going
--
stretching
themselves
one
bit
for
loss
of
future
earnings
and
as
mr.
justice
marshall
just
said
the
only
question
here
is
how
much
of
the
jury
of
awarded
for
this
man’s
pain
and
suffering.
is
this
court
going
to
decide
that
because
if
the
courts
of
appeals
are
to
decide
that
purely
on
the
basis
that
this
is
grossly
excessive
then
mustn’t
this
court
also
determine
whether
the
court
of
appeals
has
abused
its
discretion
in
deciding
that
the
court
below
has
abused
its
discretion
on
this
issue.
i
like
particularly
also
something
that
judge
leonard
hand
said
but
in
this
specific
connection
and
i
have
it
on
my
brief
in
discussing
this
type
of
review
they
call
the
attention
of
the
fact
that
court
of
appeals
must
come
at
the
matter
ones
removed
not
in
the
position
of
the
trial
judge.
and
he
said,
“we
must
in
effect
decide
whether
it
was
within
the
bounds
of
tolerable
conclusion
to
say
that
the
jury’s
verdict
was
within
the
bounds
of
tolerable
conclusion.”
to
decide
cases
by
such
tenuous
unrealities
it
seems
to
us
thoroughly
undesirable.
parties
ought
not
to
be
bound
by
gossip
or
strands,
judges
ought
not
to
engage
in
scholastic
refinements
and
that’s
precisely
what
the
court
below
has
done
here.
