would
that

justice
hugo
l.
black
--
common
law
it
was
only
the
court
that
the
case
was
tried
even
though
some
of
the
judges
participated
who
would
not
preside
in
the
trial.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
i
ask
you
was
it
not
the
same
judges
of
the
same
court
meeting
together
which
was
composed
of
the
judges
who
tried
it
and
the
other
judges
who
didn’t
try.
justice
hugo
l.
black
composed
but
not
subject
to
appeal.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
that’s
the
issue
that’s
the
facts
of
the
common
law
procedure.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
this
case
had
been
tried
in
the
state
court
what
court
would
you
first
set
aside
the
verdict
excessive?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
a
procedure
there?
i
believe
there
is
in
pennsylvania
where
they
have
plenty
of
judges
who’s
faced
on
it
all
members
of
the
same
court
that
tried
the
case.
is
that
true
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
true
in
the
state
of
new
york?
suppose
that
a
case
tried
in
state
of
new
york,
the
question
is
the
damages,
can
that
be
decided
by
the
single
judge
who
tried
it
or
do
they
call
another
judge
to
that
same
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
about
pennsylvania,
do
you
know
about
that?
justice
hugo

would
that
be
reviewed
