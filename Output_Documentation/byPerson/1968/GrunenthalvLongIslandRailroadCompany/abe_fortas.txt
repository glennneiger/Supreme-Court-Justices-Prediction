justice
abe
fortas
well
there's
nothing
like
that
in
the
--
no
such
analysis
in
the
court
of
appeals’
opinion
though,
is
there?
justice
abe
fortas
no,
the
court
of
appeals
just
said
this
is
too
much.
justice
abe
fortas
there's
no
attempt
of
analysis
in
the
court
of
appeals.
i
don’t
know
how
you
go
about
it
if
that’s
part
of
the
problem
on
the
case.
i
go
about
saying
that
this
man’s
suffering
figured
a
$5.00
in
second
or
something
like
that
would
have
entitle
him
so
much
and
no
more
how
you
do
it
but
the
court
of
appeals
here
made
no
attempt
to
do
it
as
i
see
it
they
just
said
that
it’s
too
much.
justice
abe
fortas
but
they
didn’t
say
that.
justice
abe
fortas
but
they
didn’t
even
say
that,
did
they
in
this
case?
justice
abe
fortas
they
didn’t
say
anything
except
that
they
think
is
too
much,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
let's
say
presumably,
trial
judge
is
--
see
a
lot
of
these
cases
and
have
some
sense
of
what
sort
of
the
going
rate
is
for
pain
and
suffering
to
put
it
in
those
horrible
terms
which
we
have
to
but
this
appellate
court
here
though
without
saying
that
we
don’t
believe
any
reasonable
man
could
have
arrived
without
using
any
of
the
conventional
magic
of
our
profession.
they
said,
this
is
--
we
are
going
to
set
this
aside,
it’s
too
much.
justice
abe
fortas
they
have
exhausted
the
use
of
words
like
that
we’re
in
a
pretty
pickle.
justice
abe
fortas
trial
judge
didn’t
like
to
have
a
toothache.
i
see
the
use
if
fairly
extreme
language
here,
didn’t
they
in
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
justifying
the
verdict?
