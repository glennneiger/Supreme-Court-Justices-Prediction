mr.
gribbon,
why
is
it
or
is
it
true
that
the
court
of
appeals
could
not
substitute
its
judgment
without
the
jury
as
to
the
factual
situation
but
yet
it
can
do
it
on
the
question
of
damages?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
didn’t
just
about
say
that
in
this
opinion
that
we
just
can’t
go
along
with
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
doesn’t
say
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
not
$250,000.00?
justice
thurgood
marshall
where
is
the
expertise
get
in
this
the
jury’s
here?
this
matters
for
the
jury.
not
to
the
expertise
of
a
judge
it’s
for
jury.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
didn’t
say
exclusively
i
said
instead
of
the
problem
and
they
are
not
experts.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
don’t
know
how
much
jury
would
give
if
it
gets
in
sprain
in
its
thumb?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
it
must
have
been
like
--
the
jury
verdict
was
$305,000.00?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
ad
damnum
clause
was
$250,000.00.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
since
the
jury
gave
$50,000.00
more
maybe
the
court
of
appeals
said
will
cut
$50,000.00
off
and
that’s
how
we’ll
get
a
$200,000.00
figure.
justice
thurgood
marshall
can
you
see
what
my
problem
is
i
don’t
know
what
they
meant
it
to?
they
took
a
figure
of
$200,000.00
they
didn’t
justify
it
one
way
or
the
other.
justice
thurgood
