mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
mr.
chief
justice
and
honorable
justices.
petitioner’s
principle
contention
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
is
without
power
to
review
a
trial
court’s
refusal
to
grant
a
new
trial
on
the
ground
the
jury
verdict
is
either
excessive
or
inadequate.
it
is
claimed
that
the
exercise
of
this
power
contravenes
the
seventh
amendment
of
the
constitution
and
that
it
constitutes
a
reexamination
of
fact
tried
by
jury
otherwise
been
according
to
the
rules
of
the
common
law.
i
believe
it
is
worth
making
explicit
that
there
is
not
involved
here
a
question
of
whether
a
court
can
look
into
a
jury
verdict
for
purposes
of
considering
a
challenge
either
to
its
adequacy
of
inadequacy.
so
much
is
conceded
by
the
petitioner
that
a
court
can
do
that
and
the
burden
of
the
complaint
is
that
a
court
of
appeals
lacks
that
power
under
the
seventh
amendment
and
that
only
the
trial
court
has
any
authority
whatsoever
under
the
seventh
amendment
to
look
into
on
any
basis
the
amount
of
a
jury
verdict
when
it’s
challenge
for
either
excessiveness
or
inadequacy.
in
this
case,
the
appellate
court
directed
that
a
new
trial
would
be
unnecessary
if
petitioner
agreed
to
remit
a
portion
of
the
verdict.
i
do
not
believe
and
it
hasn’t
been
argued
that
this
remittitur
feature
of
the
appellate
court’s
decision
has
any
significant
bearing
on
the
question
that
has
been
raised
as
to
the
power
of
the
appellate
court
to
order
a
new
trial.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
that
was
unanimous
with
respect
to
its
power,
yes.
judge
hays
raise
no
specifically
said
that
he
agreed
with
the
majority
on
the
constitutional
question.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
disagreed
on
the
facts
of
this
case
and
he
said
that
he
would
uphold
the
determination
of
judge
irving
ben
cooper
in
the
trial
court.
it
appears
that
this
question,
this
constitutional
question
has
never
been
directed
resolve
by
this
court.
in
1955,
in
the
neese
case
where
the
question
was
raised
but
not
resolved,
the
court
so
stated
in
a
brief
opinion,
as
to
the
cases
before
neese
there
are
certainly
and
must
be
conceded
statements
in
cases
of
this
court
particularly
in
the
last
century
which
tend
to
support
the
viewpoint
that
the
petitioner
has
suggested
here.
in
no
case
in
my
judgment
was
the
kind
of
review
that
the
appellate
court
has
performed
here
before
the
court
when
any
sort
of
statements
bearing
on
this
question
was
made.
now
as
to
the
cases,
more
recent
cases
in
this
century
none
of
them
deal
directly
with
this
problem
but
i
think
they
bear
heavily
on
the
problem
and
that
they
suggest
that
the
test
to
be
applied
in
applying
the
seventh
amendment
is
really
one
of
substantial
justice
without
principal
regard
for
the
forms
and
practices
of
common
law.
what
the
seventh
amendment
does
do
is
first
preserve
the
function
of
the
court
in
jury
as
they
existed
in
common
law
and
the
essentials
of
trial
by
jury
which
the
court
has
said
consist
of
a
jury
of
12
presided
over
by
a
judge
and
a
unanimous
verdict.
i
think
that
is
the
teaching
of
the
cases
that
would
come
to
bear
in
this
case.
as
petitioner
has
said
all
11
of
the
circuit
courts
have
considered
this
constitutional
question
some
before
neese,
some
after
neese,
all
of
them
have
considered
in
some
measure
the
very
arguments
that
have
presented
here.
each
of
the
11
appellate
courts
has
concluded
that
the
court
of
appeals
does
have
constitutional
power
to
review
a
determination
by
a
district
judge
which
refuses
to
order
a
new
trial
on
the
ground
of
a
verdict
being
excessive.
in
addition,
a
case
decided
by
this
court
last
term
eby
against
the
--
neely
against
the
eby
construction
company
while
not
directly
in
point
i
think
by
close
analogy
establishes
the
power
of
the
appellate
court
to
enter
--
to
determine
that
a
new
trial
shall
be
given.
in
that
case,
the
court
rejected
a
contention
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
without
constitutional
power
either
to
grant
a
judgment
n.o.v.
or
to
direct
a
new
trial.
and
in
so
doing
it
specifically
stated
that
so
far
as
the
restriction
of
the
seventh
amendment
was
concerned
it
really
wasn’t
any
greater
restriction
on
the
right
of
jury
trial
whether
a
trial
court
or
an
appellate
court
were
to
enter
the
judgment
n.o.v.
or
new
trial
provided
they
applied
the
proper
test.
now,
the
argument
is
advanced
in
support
of
petitioner’s
contention
is
i
submit
essentially
historical
based
upon
the
practice
at
common
law
it
was
a
king’s
bench
or
queen’s
bench
that
seem
to
have
plenary
power
over
the
amount
of
verdicts.
i
submit
that
that
argument
does
not
support
the
position
petitioner
suggest
either
is
a
matter
of
history
or
is
a
matter
of
constitutional
analysis.
first
is
a
matter
of
history,
the
argument
really
proves
too
much
because
at
common
law
it
was
not
the
judge
who
presided
over
the
trial
that
had
the
authority
acting
alone
to
determine
whether
the
amount
of
the
verdict
was
excessive
or
inadequate.
that
power
did
not
reside
in
the
single
judge
who
presided
over
the
trial,
rather
the
power
over
verdicts,
the
amounts
of
verdicts
resided
in
the
full
court
of
king’s
bench
sitting
en
banc
at
westminster
consisting
of
the
four
judges,
three
of
whom
would
not
have
participated
in
the
trial
at
all.
i
submit
therefore
that
insofar
as
substance
is
concern
this
reexamination
if
you
wish
or
review
of
the
jury
verdict
that
the
king’s
bench
did
which
consisted
of
four
judges
really
gives
in
essence
the
kind
of
an
appellate
review
that
we’re
talking
about
there
because
you
had
participating
in
that
review
three
judges
who
had
not
been
exposed
to
the
tempers
of
the
courtroom
who
brought
an
element
of
detachment
and
objectiveness
to
this,
and
furthermore
the
right
to
look
over
the
jury
verdict
was
never
given
solely
to
that
one
judge
who
had
participated
in
the
trial
and
who
quite
possibly
had
been
exposed
to
the
tempers
of
the
trial
who
always
reserved
--
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
my
information
is
it
could
not
be
reviewed
by
any
trial
--
higher
court.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
i
think
it’s
formalistic
to
say
that
it
was
only
the
court
before
whom
the
case
was
tried
because
three
of
the
men
sitting
on
the
court
have
not
tried
the
case.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
it
was
your
honor
it
was
--
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
it
was
not
subject
to
appeal.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
that’s
the
facts
and
my
suggestion
is
that
those
facts
particularly
the
circumstance,
the
three
judges
who
had
not
sit
in
on
or
sat
down
on
the
trial,
have
not
reviewed
the
demeanor
of
the
witnesses
and
were
looking
at
it
from
afar
in
effect
did
participate
in
the
examination
of
the
challenge
of
the
jury
verdict
as
being
excessive.
and
it
is
for
that
reason
that
i
suggest
the
cases
in
this
court
which
hold
that
it
is
the
substance
of
what
was
required
at
common
law
without
regard
to
the
formalities
of
the
common
law
procedure
that
are
preserved
by
the
seventh
amendment.
this
i
submit
in
line
with
the
decision
of
the
neely
case
is
simply
a
matter
of
distributing
the
function
of
the
court
as
between
trial
court
and
an
appellate
court
and
does
not
go
to
the
division
of
functions
or
the
province
of
the
jury
on
the
one
hand
and
the
court
on
the
other.
nor
i
submit
does
it
have
any
effect
on
the
real
vital
parts
of
trial
by
jury
as
this
court
has
noted
that
there
are
12
men
presided
over
by
a
judge
and
their
verdict
is
unanimous.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
in
the
state
court
i
should
think
the
trial
court,
the
court
of
first
instance.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
it
is
not
true
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york
which
is
where
this
case
came
up
from.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
your
honor
i
regret
to
say
i'm
not
on
an
expert
on
new
york
practice.
i
do
not
think
they
call
another
judges.
i
know
that
in
the
district
of
columbia
they
do
not
call
another
judges.
it
is
just
the
judge
who
sat
on
the
case.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
i'm
sorry
i
don’t
know
that.
now
if
the
court
please,
the
petitioner
contends
that
even
if
the
court
of
appeals
can
constitutionally
review
a
trial
court’s
refusal
to
order
a
new
trial
on
the
ground
of
the
verdict
is
excessive
that
this
court
urge
in
exercising
the
review.
and
there
are
two
aspects
to
this
problem,
one
of
which
the
standard
of
review
that
was
applied
by
this
court
i
think
goes
also
to
the
question
of
the
constitutional
power.
it
is
not
argued
here
by
respondent
that
an
appellate
court
has
exactly
the
same
kind
of
a
power
that
a
trial
court
has
in
dealing
with
the
challenge
to
a
verdict
as
being
excessive.
the
standard
of
review
that
this
court
applied
and
that
has
been
applied
by
the
other
to
circuit
courts
is
that
every
benefit
of
doubt
must
be
given
to
the
trial
court’s
examination
of
the
jury
verdict.
every
deference
must
be
paid
to
the
fact
that
the
trial
court
had
a
superior
opportunity
to
examine
the
witnesses
and
knew
more
about
the
case,
and
it
is
only
when
after
giving
every
benefit
of
the
doubt
to
what
the
trial
court
has
decided
that
the
appellate
court
has
the
authority,
the
constitutional
authority
that
we
say
the
court
has
here
to
set
aside
the
action
of
the
trial
court
as
being
either
without
support
in
the
evidence
or
an
abuse
of
discretion.
now,
the
second
circuit
and
perhaps
the
most
detailed
examination
of
this
problem
in
the
dagnello
case
in
1961
in
which
this
court
denied
cert
went
into
great
detail
as
to
the
limits
of
appellate
court
review
of
the
determination
by
a
trial
judge
not
to
grant
a
new
trial.
that
decision
of
the
second
circuit
was
written
by
judge
medina
who
wrote
this
opinion
here
and
he
incorporated
the
views
expressed
in
the
dagnello
into
his
decision
here
and
said
he
was
applying
the
teaching
of
that
case.
and
the
dagnello
decision
elaborated
on
a
number
of
words
that
had
been
used
to
describe
the
kind
of
determination
that
the
appellate
court
must
come
to
before
it
was
justified
in
rejecting
the
determination
of
the
district
court.
i
think
that
the
words
overly,
excessive,
monstrous
without
any
support
in
the
record
all
seemed
to
me
to
mean
about
the
same
thing
and
that
is
that
giving
what
the
district
judge
has
decided
as
to
the
excessiveness
charge
of
diverting
giving
that
every
benefit
of
the
doubt.
nonetheless
the
appellate
court
concludes
that
the
amount
of
the
verdict
simply
does
not
comport
with
standards
of
justice.
it
may
be
abuse
of
discretion
is
as
good
term
can
be
use,
but
in
any
event
the
appellate
court
is
giving
the
district
court,
the
trial
court
in
these
circumstances
i
suggest
exactly
the
same
kind
of
benefit
of
doubt
that
a
district
court
must
give
to
a
jury
verdict
in
considering
whether
the
evidence
is
sufficient
to
go
to
the
jury.
every
benefit
of
the
doubt
must
be
resolved
in
favor
of
the
petitioner.
now
that
is
precisely
what
judge
medina
did
in
this
case
here,
giving
every
benefit
of
the
doubt
as
he
said
to
the
petitioner.
his
conclusion
joined
in
by
the
other
member
of
the
court
was
that
nonetheless
the
jury
verdict
was
outside
the
bounds
of
appropriateness
as
set
by
legal
standards
not
simply
by
subjective
standards.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
your
honor,
you
are
right.
let
me
deal
with
that
now
and
i
would
like
to
suggest
briefly
at
least
four
different
elements
that
i
believe
fully
support
the
determination
by
the
appellate
court
here
that
the
verdict
that
was
entered
was
in
excess
of
any
legal
standards
of
reasonableness.
in
the
first
place,
the
complaint
in
this
case
asked
for
$250,000.00,
$55,000.00
less
than
the
verdict
that
was
brought
in.
now
i
don’t
suggest
that
the
plaintiff
shall
never
be
able
to
get
any
more
than
he
asked
for
in
his
complaint.
but
this
complaint
was
not
a
do-it-yourself-job.
it
was
not
prepared
by
inexperienced
counsel.
the
plaintiff
has
been
exceedingly
well
represented
all
the
way
through
here
and
able
trial
counsel
rarely
understate
the
ad
damnum.
therefore,
i
believe
it
was
quite
appropriate
for
the
appellate
court
to
consider
the
amount
ask
for
in
the
complaint
as
one
of
the
operative
facts
in
looking
to
whether
this
jury
verdict
did
exceed
the
bounds
of
reasonableness.
the
second
point
and
this
too
was
considered
by
the
appellate
court
is
that
the
plaintiff
here
did
not
suffer
injuries
to
the
vital
body
functions
or
even
lost
of
limb.
his
own
doctor
who
was
entirely
candid
in
his
examination
said
that
the
plaintiff
was
left
all
in
all
with
the
poor
functioning
foot,
a
tie
had
fallen
on
his
foot
in
the
course
of
his
work
on
the
railroad
and
smashed
a
couple
of
toes.
he
had
been
subjected
to
considerable
hospitalization.
there
is
no
question
that
the
plaintiff
suffered
damages,
he
was
hurt
and
he
suffered
injury.
on
the
other
hand,
he
didn’t
suffer
a
loss
of
limb,
a
leg
wasn’t
amputated
and
as
long
as
it
is
necessary
under
our
legal
system
of
law
to
equate
suffering
and
damages
with
dollars
some
kind
of
rules
have
to
be
employed
in
order
that
the
damages
shall
be
in
accordance
with
some
standard
of
justice.
so
that
the
doctor
said
all
in
all
he’s
got
a
poor
functioning
foot,
and
while
such
a
handicap
as
this
is
admittedly
serious
i
suggest
it
is
not
worth
in
the
parlance
of
damage
awards,
the
lost
of
a
leg,
an
arm,
or
eyes.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
your
honor,
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
draw
the
comparisons
that
i
am
drawing.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
the
court
of
appeals
did
refer
to
the
--
he
spoke
of
the
right
foot
was
crushed,
hospitalized,
and
did
speak
of
the
plaintiff’s
injury.
that
the
court
of
appeals,
this
is
at
pages
65
and
66
of
the
record
did
relate
the
circumstances
of
the
injury
and
gave
what
in
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
was
an
accurate
factual
description
of
the
injury
and
of
plaintiff
suffering.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
well
they
made
no
attempt
to
compare
the
$200,000.00
which
the
court
had
concluded
was
the
maximum
of
what
they
permitted
under
the
law
with
the
$305,000.00
which
the
jury
had
brought
in
and
which
the
judge
had
approved.
but
they
did
state
his
damages
and
his
suffering
in
some
considerable
detail
so
that
it
was
perfectly
clear
that
the
court
of
appeals
considered
it.
i
don’t
think
it’s
incumbent
upon
them
to
go
out
and
say
we
think
that
judge
cooper
was
wrong
in
assessing
it
at
this
that
and
the
other
thing.
it
has
to
be
considered
in
the
aggregate.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
they
did
not
put
a
dollar
amount
on
suffering.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
we
think
the
whole
verdict
is
too
much.
let
me
back
--
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
what
they
said
was
$126,000.00
was
suggested
to
the
jury
by
his
own
counsel
as
being
the
amount
involved
for
loss
of
past
wages
and
future
wages.
now,
the
difference
between
$126,000.00
and
$305,000.00
presumably
is
for
pain
and
suffering
and
i
think
it
is
fair
to
say
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
shocked
them.
they
thought
that
was
too
much.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
they
said
they
didn’t
think
anything
over
$200,000.00
would
be
adequate.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
took
every
pains
not
to
put
itself
in
the
place
of
the
jury.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
because
of
what
they
said
here
that
they
have
don’t
--
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
in
the
opinion,
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
no
more
so
i
don’t
think
that
in
any
court
in
considering
whether
evidence
should
go
to
the
jury
or
whether
an
n.o.v.
should
be
granted.
there
is
a
problem
here
in
making
allowance
for
what
somebody
else
could
possibly
think
as
for
example
what
a
jury
could
think
as
to
whether
certain
things
amount
to
negligence
and
yet
concluding
that
no
reasonable
jury
could
come
to
that
conclusion
not
just
that
you
or
the
court
can
come
to
that
conclusion
but
really
that
no
reasonable
person
could
come
to
that
conclusion.
now,
that’s
the
kind
of
a
determination
that’s
made
by
courts
in
directing
verdicts
and
entering
judgments
n.o.v.
all
the
time.
the
appellate
court
did
its
very
best
and
i
think
the
results
it
had
here
do
indicate.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
your
honor,
they
didn’t
--
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
in
this
case,
they
didn’t
say
that
but
they
incorporate
--
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
they
incorporated
by
reference
their
elaborate
decision
in
dagnello
in
which
just
a
few
years
previously
judge
medina
had
gone
into
this
very
thing
about
how
necessary
it
was
to
give
every
benefit
of
doubt
to
the
injured
party.
and
in
that
case,
with
a
jury
verdict
of
$97,000.00
for
a
leg
that
was
amputated
above
than
knee,
he
concluded
that
that
was
not
in
excess
of
the
bounds
of
reasonableness.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
i
wonder
if
the
court
hadn't
exhausted
its
use
of
the
words
as
you
suggest
in
the
earlier
dagnello
opinion
where
it
went
into
a
great
--
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
all
sides
agreed
that
the
rule
that
was
to
be
applied
in
that
--
that
had
been
articulated
in
the
dagnello
was
what
controlled
here.
and
in
dagnello,
this
court
through
judge
medina
specifically
said,
“you
got
to
give
every
benefit
of
the
doubt.”
and
even
the
district
court
here
recognized
that
there
was
some
point
beyond
which
is
a
matter
of
law
the
jury
could
go.
he
spoke
of
it
and
indeed
he
started
out.
he
said,
at
first
blush
concededly
this
is
accessible.
but
then
the
judge
went
on
and
described
the
nature
of
the
injuries
and
the
appellate
court
here
was
impressed
by
the
difference
between
the
trial
judges’
characterization
of
the
injuries
based
upon
the
plaintiff
in
the
doctor’s
testimony
and
the
testimony
itself.
and
there
is
a
considerable
difference
between
what
these
candid
witnesses
said
as
to
their
injuries
and
how
the
trial
judge
viewed
it
when
the
amount
of
the
verdict
was
challenged.
the
petitioner
here
said,
that
the
pain
was
sort
of
like
a
dull
toothache
that
he
had
learned
to
live
with
it
and
it
was
bearable.
it
hurt
a
little
bit
more
when
it
was
--
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
the
trial
judge
did
--
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
and
i
think
that
that
entered
--
i
think
it’s
clear
that
that
entered
into
the
determination
of
the
appellate
court.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
excuse
me
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
the
full
trial
record
is
in
the
court
only
the
portion
dealing
with
injuries
has
been
printed.
but
the
full
trial
record
is
largely
--
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
two
or
three
days;
the
full
trial
record
is
--
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
this
is
the
full
trial
record,
so
it
was
not
a
long
trial.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
no,
mr.
justice
marshall,
i'm
not
suggesting
that
it
can
substitute
its
view
for
that
of
the
jury.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
yes,
it
can
say
that
we
believe
that
the
jury’s
verdict
is
excessive
is
beyond
all
reasonable
bounds.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
unless,
the
net
effect
of
saying
$305,000.00
is
excessive
the
most
that
can
be
allowed
for
this
sort
of
injury
is
$200,000.00.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
this
is
where
a
certain
amount
of
expertise
and
experience
as
mr.
justice
fortas
pointed
out
has
to
come
in
to
play
and
sure
the
district
--
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
the
amount
of
the
jury
verdict
was
never
even
at
common
law
exclusively
for
the
jury.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
no,
but
if
the
jury
comes
in
with
the
verdict
of
$1
million
for
a
sprained
thumb.
i
submit
that
that’s
going
to
be
set
aside.
it’s
going
to
be
set
aside
if
the
district
court
doesn’t
set
it
aside,
the
appellate
court
is
going
set
it
aside,
and
if
it
doesn’t
this
court
is
going
to
set
it
aside.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
well,
maybe
it
would
be
inadequate
in
those
circumstances.[laughter]
but
in
any
event
the
--
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
yes,
sir.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
it
was.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
well,
they
didn’t
say
that.
no,
i
can't
say
what
they
thought.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
well,
i
can't
say
they
didn’t
justify
it.
they
took
the
figures
that
have
been
put
into
the
jury
on
loss
of
wages
past
and
future.
and
then,
they
related
the
testimony
as
was
on
the
full
record
and
not
controverted
as
to
the
amount
of
suffering.
and
based
on
that,
they
said
in
their
judgment
giving
a
trial
judge
every
benefit
of
the
doubt
in
his
upholding
the
jury
verdict.
nonetheless,
this
seemed
to
them
to
be
excessive;
so
excessive
as
to
require
reversal.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
i
see
it
and
i'm
not
suggesting
it
isn’t
the
difficult
problem
and
along
the
lines
of
mr.
justice
fortas
as
i
believe
alluded
to
earlier,
trial
judges
aren’t
the
only
ones
that
have
experience
in
jury
verdicts.
appellate
judges
have
the
same
course
of
experience
and
indeed
may
be
and
as
good
of
position
to
view
them.
in
that
connection,
we
--
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
judge
medina?
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
oh!
i've
seen
him
many
times
at
the
courtroom.
i
don’t
know
whether
he
has
--
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
for
trial,
i
think
that
is
correct.
he
never
was
a
--
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
that’s
right.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
i
think
it
depends
on
the
court.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
and
the
state
court
i
think
probably
not
in
the
federal
court
--
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
i'm
suggesting
that
in
a
federal
court,
the
district
judge
may
not
necessarily
get
a
greater
exposure
than
the
federal
appellate
court.
but
i
do
think
--
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
well,
it
maybe
a
question
of
two
people
or
three
people
who
have
not
been
exposed
to
exactly
the
same
problems
as
the
trial
judge
bringing
their
judgment
to
bear
on
it.
not
just
to
second
guess
of
it
but
to
give
him
every
possible
benefit
of
the
doubt
and
in
some
few
instances
they're
going
to
conclude
that
this
was
beyond
the
bounds
of
reasonableness.
we
are
--
we
have
put
into
our
appendix
to
our
brief
a
quite
complete
list
of
jury
verdicts
in
recent
case
and
dollars
that
have
been
awarded.
and
i
think
it
is
from
a
distillation
of
those
cases
that
the
common
law
principles
of
excessiveness
of
verdict
must
be
determined.
as
the
court
please,
in
closing
let
me
suggest
if
i
may
that
i
think
the
second
aspect
of
this
case
that
is
whether
the
appellate
court
should
be
upheld
in
reverse
in
a
district
court
calls
really
for
more
than
most
cases
that
quality
of
judging
that
judge
learned
hand
spoke
up
on
the
occasion
of
his
50th
anniversary
on
the
court.
when
he
said
that
the
judging
was
in
the
nature
of
an
art,
the
judge
has
some
vague
purposes
and
frames
of
references
and
among
these
he
must
choose
but
choose
he
must
do.
now,
unfortunately,
the
choices
that
are
made
here
really
can't
be
proven
by
words
or
numbers
the
way
you
would
prove
a
mathematical
or
a
logical
proposition.
but
i
submit
that
the
manner
in
which
this
district
court
particularly
in
the
light
of
its
dagnello
case,
this
appellate
court
went
about
resolving
this
question
shows
a
thoroughly
objective
and
reasonable
resolution
of
the
interest
of
the
parties
and
should
accordingly
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
just
on
damages.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
just
on
the
damages,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
mr.
chief
justice
and
honorable
justices.
petitioner’s
principle
contention
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
is
without
power
to
review
a
trial
court’s
refusal
to
grant
a
new
trial
on
the
ground
the
jury
verdict
is
either
excessive
or
inadequate.
it
is
claimed
that
the
exercise
of
this
power
contravenes
the
seventh
amendment
of
the
constitution
and
that
it
constitutes
a
reexamination
of
fact
tried
by
jury
otherwise
been
according
to
the
rules
of
the
common
law.
i
believe
it
is
worth
making
explicit
that
there
is
not
involved
here
a
question
of
whether
a
court
can
look
into
a
jury
verdict
for
purposes
of
considering
a
challenge
either
to
its
adequacy
of
inadequacy.
so
much
is
conceded
by
the
petitioner
that
a
court
can
do
that
and
the
burden
of
the
complaint
is
that
a
court
of
appeals
lacks
that
power
under
the
seventh
amendment
and
that
only
the
trial
court
has
any
authority
whatsoever
under
the
seventh
amendment
to
look
into
on
any
basis
the
amount
of
a
jury
verdict
when
it’s
challenge
for
either
excessiveness
or
inadequacy.
in
this
case,
the
appellate
court
directed
that
a
new
trial
would
be
unnecessary
if
petitioner
agreed
to
remit
a
portion
of
the
verdict.
i
do
not
believe
and
it
hasn’t
been
argued
that
this
remittitur
feature
of
the
appellate
court’s
decision
has
any
significant
bearing
on
the
question
that
has
been
raised
as
to
the
power
of
the
appellate
court
to
order
a
new
trial.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
that
was
unanimous
with
respect
to
its
power,
yes.
judge
hays
raise
no
specifically
said
that
he
agreed
with
the
majority
on
the
constitutional
question.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
disagreed
on
the
facts
of
this
case
and
he
said
that
he
would
uphold
the
determination
of
judge
irving
ben
cooper
in
the
trial
court.
it
appears
that
this
question,
this
constitutional
question
has
never
been
directed
resolve
by
this
court.
in
1955,
in
the
neese
case
where
the
question
was
raised
but
not
resolved,
the
court
so
stated
in
a
brief
opinion,
as
to
the
cases
before
neese
there
are
certainly
and
must
be
conceded
statements
in
cases
of
this
court
particularly
in
the
last
century
which
tend
to
support
the
viewpoint
that
the
petitioner
has
suggested
here.
in
no
case
in
my
judgment
was
the
kind
of
review
that
the
appellate
court
has
performed
here
before
the
court
when
any
sort
of
statements
bearing
on
this
question
was
made.
now
as
to
the
cases,
more
recent
cases
in
this
century
none
of
them
deal
directly
with
this
problem
but
i
think
they
bear
heavily
on
the
problem
and
that
they
suggest
that
the
test
to
be
applied
in
applying
the
seventh
amendment
is
really
one
of
substantial
justice
without
principal
regard
for
the
forms
and
practices
of
common
law.
what
the
seventh
amendment
does
do
is
first
preserve
the
function
of
the
court
in
jury
as
they
existed
in
common
law
and
the
essentials
of
trial
by
jury
which
the
court
has
said
consist
of
a
jury
of
12
presided
over
by
a
judge
and
a
unanimous
verdict.
i
think
that
is
the
teaching
of
the
cases
that
would
come
to
bear
in
this
case.
as
petitioner
has
said
all
11
of
the
circuit
courts
have
considered
this
constitutional
question
some
before
neese,
some
after
neese,
all
of
them
have
considered
in
some
measure
the
very
arguments
that
have
presented
here.
each
of
the
11
appellate
courts
has
concluded
that
the
court
of
appeals
does
have
constitutional
power
to
review
a
determination
by
a
district
judge
which
refuses
to
order
a
new
trial
on
the
ground
of
a
verdict
being
excessive.
in
addition,
a
case
decided
by
this
court
last
term
eby
against
the
--
neely
against
the
eby
construction
company
while
not
directly
in
point
i
think
by
close
analogy
establishes
the
power
of
the
appellate
court
to
enter
--
to
determine
that
a
new
trial
shall
be
given.
in
that
case,
the
court
rejected
a
contention
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
without
constitutional
power
either
to
grant
a
judgment
n.o.v.
or
to
direct
a
new
trial.
and
in
so
doing
it
specifically
stated
that
so
far
as
the
restriction
of
the
seventh
amendment
was
concerned
it
really
wasn’t
any
greater
restriction
on
the
right
of
jury
trial
whether
a
trial
court
or
an
appellate
court
were
to
enter
the
judgment
n.o.v.
or
new
trial
provided
they
applied
the
proper
test.
now,
the
argument
is
advanced
in
support
of
petitioner’s
contention
is
i
submit
essentially
historical
based
upon
the
practice
at
common
law
it
was
a
king’s
bench
or
queen’s
bench
that
seem
to
have
plenary
power
over
the
amount
of
verdicts.
i
submit
that
that
argument
does
not
support
the
position
petitioner
suggest
either
is
a
matter
of
history
or
is
a
matter
of
constitutional
analysis.
first
is
a
matter
of
history,
the
argument
really
proves
too
much
because
at
common
law
it
was
not
the
judge
who
presided
over
the
trial
that
had
the
authority
acting
alone
to
determine
whether
the
amount
of
the
verdict
was
excessive
or
inadequate.
that
power
did
not
reside
in
the
single
judge
who
presided
over
the
trial,
rather
the
power
over
verdicts,
the
amounts
of
verdicts
resided
in
the
full
court
of
king’s
bench
sitting
en
banc
at
westminster
consisting
of
the
four
judges,
three
of
whom
would
not
have
participated
in
the
trial
at
all.
i
submit
therefore
that
insofar
as
substance
is
concern
this
reexamination
if
you
wish
or
review
of
the
jury
verdict
that
the
king’s
bench
did
which
consisted
of
four
judges
really
gives
in
essence
the
kind
of
an
appellate
review
that
we’re
talking
about
there
because
you
had
participating
in
that
review
three
judges
who
had
not
been
exposed
to
the
tempers
of
the
courtroom
who
brought
an
element
of
detachment
and
objectiveness
to
this,
and
furthermore
the
right
to
look
over
the
jury
verdict
was
never
given
solely
to
that
one
judge
who
had
participated
in
the
trial
and
who
quite
possibly
had
been
exposed
to
the
tempers
of
the
trial
who
always
reserved
--
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
my
information
is
it
could
not
be
reviewed
by
any
trial
--
higher
court.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
i
think
it’s
formalistic
to
say
that
it
was
only
the
court
before
whom
the
case
was
tried
because
three
of
the
men
sitting
on
the
court
have
not
tried
the
case.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
it
was
your
honor
it
was
--
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
it
was
not
subject
to
appeal.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
that’s
the
facts
and
my
suggestion
is
that
those
facts
particularly
the
circumstance,
the
three
judges
who
had
not
sit
in
on
or
sat
down
on
the
trial,
have
not
reviewed
the
demeanor
of
the
witnesses
and
were
looking
at
it
from
afar
in
effect
did
participate
in
the
examination
of
the
challenge
of
the
jury
verdict
as
being
excessive.
and
it
is
for
that
reason
that
i
suggest
the
cases
in
this
court
which
hold
that
it
is
the
substance
of
what
was
required
at
common
law
without
regard
to
the
formalities
of
the
common
law
procedure
that
are
preserved
by
the
seventh
amendment.
this
i
submit
in
line
with
the
decision
of
the
neely
case
is
simply
a
matter
of
distributing
the
function
of
the
court
as
between
trial
court
and
an
appellate
court
and
does
not
go
to
the
division
of
functions
or
the
province
of
the
jury
on
the
one
hand
and
the
court
on
the
other.
nor
i
submit
does
it
have
any
effect
on
the
real
vital
parts
of
trial
by
jury
as
this
court
has
noted
that
there
are
12
men
presided
over
by
a
judge
and
their
verdict
is
unanimous.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
in
the
state
court
i
should
think
the
trial
court,
the
court
of
first
instance.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
it
is
not
true
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york
which
is
where
this
case
came
up
from.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
your
honor
i
regret
to
say
i'm
not
on
an
expert
on
new
york
practice.
i
do
not
think
they
call
another
judges.
i
know
that
in
the
district
of
columbia
they
do
not
call
another
judges.
it
is
just
the
judge
who
sat
on
the
case.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
i'm
sorry
i
don’t
know
that.
now
if
the
court
please,
the
petitioner
contends
that
even
if
the
court
of
appeals
can
constitutionally
review
a
trial
court’s
refusal
to
order
a
new
trial
on
the
ground
of
the
verdict
is
excessive
that
this
court
urge
in
exercising
the
review.
and
there
are
two
aspects
to
this
problem,
one
of
which
the
standard
of
review
that
was
applied
by
this
court
i
think
goes
also
to
the
question
of
the
constitutional
power.
it
is
not
argued
here
by
respondent
that
an
appellate
court
has
exactly
the
same
kind
of
a
power
that
a
trial
court
has
in
dealing
with
the
challenge
to
a
verdict
as
being
excessive.
the
standard
of
review
that
this
court
applied
and
that
has
been
applied
by
the
other
to
circuit
courts
is
that
every
benefit
of
doubt
must
be
given
to
the
trial
court’s
examination
of
the
jury
verdict.
every
deference
must
be
paid
to
the
fact
that
the
trial
court
had
a
superior
opportunity
to
examine
the
witnesses
and
knew
more
about
the
case,
and
it
is
only
when
after
giving
every
benefit
of
the
doubt
to
what
the
trial
court
has
decided
that
the
appellate
court
has
the
authority,
the
constitutional
authority
that
we
say
the
court
has
here
to
set
aside
the
action
of
the
trial
court
as
being
either
without
support
in
the
evidence
or
an
abuse
of
discretion.
now,
the
second
circuit
and
perhaps
the
most
detailed
examination
of
this
problem
in
the
dagnello
case
in
1961
in
which
this
court
denied
cert
went
into
great
detail
as
to
the
limits
of
appellate
court
review
of
the
determination
by
a
trial
judge
not
to
grant
a
new
trial.
that
decision
of
the
second
circuit
was
written
by
judge
medina
who
wrote
this
opinion
here
and
he
incorporated
the
views
expressed
in
the
dagnello
into
his
decision
here
and
said
he
was
applying
the
teaching
of
that
case.
and
the
dagnello
decision
elaborated
on
a
number
of
words
that
had
been
used
to
describe
the
kind
of
determination
that
the
appellate
court
must
come
to
before
it
was
justified
in
rejecting
the
determination
of
the
district
court.
i
think
that
the
words
overly,
excessive,
monstrous
without
any
support
in
the
record
all
seemed
to
me
to
mean
about
the
same
thing
and
that
is
that
giving
what
the
district
judge
has
decided
as
to
the
excessiveness
charge
of
diverting
giving
that
every
benefit
of
the
doubt.
nonetheless
the
appellate
court
concludes
that
the
amount
of
the
verdict
simply
does
not
comport
with
standards
of
justice.
it
may
be
abuse
of
discretion
is
as
good
term
can
be
use,
but
in
any
event
the
appellate
court
is
giving
the
district
court,
the
trial
court
in
these
circumstances
i
suggest
exactly
the
same
kind
of
benefit
of
doubt
that
a
district
court
must
give
to
a
jury
verdict
in
considering
whether
the
evidence
is
sufficient
to
go
to
the
jury.
every
benefit
of
the
doubt
must
be
resolved
in
favor
of
the
petitioner.
now
that
is
precisely
what
judge
medina
did
in
this
case
here,
giving
every
benefit
of
the
doubt
as
he
said
to
the
petitioner.
his
conclusion
joined
in
by
the
other
member
of
the
court
was
that
nonetheless
the
jury
verdict
was
outside
the
bounds
of
appropriateness
as
set
by
legal
standards
not
simply
by
subjective
standards.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
your
honor,
you
are
right.
let
me
deal
with
that
now
and
i
would
like
to
suggest
briefly
at
least
four
different
elements
that
i
believe
fully
support
the
determination
by
the
appellate
court
here
that
the
verdict
that
was
entered
was
in
excess
of
any
legal
standards
of
reasonableness.
in
the
first
place,
the
complaint
in
this
case
asked
for
$250,000.00,
$55,000.00
less
than
the
verdict
that
was
brought
in.
now
i
don’t
suggest
that
the
plaintiff
shall
never
be
able
to
get
any
more
than
he
asked
for
in
his
complaint.
but
this
complaint
was
not
a
do-it-yourself-job.
it
was
not
prepared
by
inexperienced
counsel.
the
plaintiff
has
been
exceedingly
well
represented
all
the
way
through
here
and
able
trial
counsel
rarely
understate
the
ad
damnum.
therefore,
i
believe
it
was
quite
appropriate
for
the
appellate
court
to
consider
the
amount
ask
for
in
the
complaint
as
one
of
the
operative
facts
in
looking
to
whether
this
jury
verdict
did
exceed
the
bounds
of
reasonableness.
the
second
point
and
this
too
was
considered
by
the
appellate
court
is
that
the
plaintiff
here
did
not
suffer
injuries
to
the
vital
body
functions
or
even
lost
of
limb.
his
own
doctor
who
was
entirely
candid
in
his
examination
said
that
the
plaintiff
was
left
all
in
all
with
the
poor
functioning
foot,
a
tie
had
fallen
on
his
foot
in
the
course
of
his
work
on
the
railroad
and
smashed
a
couple
of
toes.
he
had
been
subjected
to
considerable
hospitalization.
there
is
no
question
that
the
plaintiff
suffered
damages,
he
was
hurt
and
he
suffered
injury.
on
the
other
hand,
he
didn’t
suffer
a
loss
of
limb,
a
leg
wasn’t
amputated
and
as
long
as
it
is
necessary
under
our
legal
system
of
law
to
equate
suffering
and
damages
with
dollars
some
kind
of
rules
have
to
be
employed
in
order
that
the
damages
shall
be
in
accordance
with
some
standard
of
justice.
so
that
the
doctor
said
all
in
all
he’s
got
a
poor
functioning
foot,
and
while
such
a
handicap
as
this
is
admittedly
serious
i
suggest
it
is
not
worth
in
the
parlance
of
damage
awards,
the
lost
of
a
leg,
an
arm,
or
eyes.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
your
honor,
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
draw
the
comparisons
that
i
am
drawing.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
the
court
of
appeals
did
refer
to
the
--
he
spoke
of
the
right
foot
was
crushed,
hospitalized,
and
did
speak
of
the
plaintiff’s
injury.
that
the
court
of
appeals,
this
is
at
pages
65
and
66
of
the
record
did
relate
the
circumstances
of
the
injury
and
gave
what
in
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
was
an
accurate
factual
description
of
the
injury
and
of
plaintiff
suffering.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
well
they
made
no
attempt
to
compare
the
$200,000.00
which
the
court
had
concluded
was
the
maximum
of
what
they
permitted
under
the
law
with
the
$305,000.00
which
the
jury
had
brought
in
and
which
the
judge
had
approved.
but
they
did
state
his
damages
and
his
suffering
in
some
considerable
detail
so
that
it
was
perfectly
clear
that
the
court
of
appeals
considered
it.
i
don’t
think
it’s
incumbent
upon
them
to
go
out
and
say
we
think
that
judge
cooper
was
wrong
in
assessing
it
at
this
that
and
the
other
thing.
it
has
to
be
considered
in
the
aggregate.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
they
did
not
put
a
dollar
amount
on
suffering.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
we
think
the
whole
verdict
is
too
much.
let
me
back
--
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
what
they
said
was
$126,000.00
was
suggested
to
the
jury
by
his
own
counsel
as
being
the
amount
involved
for
loss
of
past
wages
and
future
wages.
now,
the
difference
between
$126,000.00
and
$305,000.00
presumably
is
for
pain
and
suffering
and
i
think
it
is
fair
to
say
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
shocked
them.
they
thought
that
was
too
much.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
they
said
they
didn’t
think
anything
over
$200,000.00
would
be
adequate.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
took
every
pains
not
to
put
itself
in
the
place
of
the
jury.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
because
of
what
they
said
here
that
they
have
don’t
--
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
in
the
opinion,
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
no
more
so
i
don’t
think
that
in
any
court
in
considering
whether
evidence
should
go
to
the
jury
or
whether
an
n.o.v.
should
be
granted.
there
is
a
problem
here
in
making
allowance
for
what
somebody
else
could
possibly
think
as
for
example
what
a
jury
could
think
as
to
whether
certain
things
amount
to
negligence
and
yet
concluding
that
no
reasonable
jury
could
come
to
that
conclusion
not
just
that
you
or
the
court
can
come
to
that
conclusion
but
really
that
no
reasonable
person
could
come
to
that
conclusion.
now,
that’s
the
kind
of
a
determination
that’s
made
by
courts
in
directing
verdicts
and
entering
judgments
n.o.v.
all
the
time.
the
appellate
court
did
its
very
best
and
i
think
the
results
it
had
here
do
indicate.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
your
honor,
they
didn’t
--
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
in
this
case,
they
didn’t
say
that
but
they
incorporate
--
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
they
incorporated
by
reference
their
elaborate
decision
in
dagnello
in
which
just
a
few
years
previously
judge
medina
had
gone
into
this
very
thing
about
how
necessary
it
was
to
give
every
benefit
of
doubt
to
the
injured
party.
and
in
that
case,
with
a
jury
verdict
of
$97,000.00
for
a
leg
that
was
amputated
above
than
knee,
he
concluded
that
that
was
not
in
excess
of
the
bounds
of
reasonableness.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
i
wonder
if
the
court
hadn't
exhausted
its
use
of
the
words
as
you
suggest
in
the
earlier
dagnello
opinion
where
it
went
into
a
great
--
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
all
sides
agreed
that
the
rule
that
was
to
be
applied
in
that
--
that
had
been
articulated
in
the
dagnello
was
what
controlled
here.
and
in
dagnello,
this
court
through
judge
medina
specifically
said,
“you
got
to
give
every
benefit
of
the
doubt.”
and
even
the
district
court
here
recognized
that
there
was
some
point
beyond
which
is
a
matter
of
law
the
jury
could
go.
he
spoke
of
it
and
indeed
he
started
out.
he
said,
at
first
blush
concededly
this
is
accessible.
but
then
the
judge
went
on
and
described
the
nature
of
the
injuries
and
the
appellate
court
here
was
impressed
by
the
difference
between
the
trial
judges’
characterization
of
the
injuries
based
upon
the
plaintiff
in
the
doctor’s
testimony
and
the
testimony
itself.
and
there
is
a
considerable
difference
between
what
these
candid
witnesses
said
as
to
their
injuries
and
how
the
trial
judge
viewed
it
when
the
amount
of
the
verdict
was
challenged.
the
petitioner
here
said,
that
the
pain
was
sort
of
like
a
dull
toothache
that
he
had
learned
to
live
with
it
and
it
was
bearable.
it
hurt
a
little
bit
more
when
it
was
--
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
the
trial
judge
did
--
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
and
i
think
that
that
entered
--
i
think
it’s
clear
that
that
entered
into
the
determination
of
the
appellate
court.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
excuse
me
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
the
full
trial
record
is
in
the
court
only
the
portion
dealing
with
injuries
has
been
printed.
but
the
full
trial
record
is
largely
--
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
two
or
three
days;
the
full
trial
record
is
--
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
this
is
the
full
trial
record,
so
it
was
not
a
long
trial.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
no,
mr.
justice
marshall,
i'm
not
suggesting
that
it
can
substitute
its
view
for
that
of
the
jury.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
yes,
it
can
say
that
we
believe
that
the
jury’s
verdict
is
excessive
is
beyond
all
reasonable
bounds.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
unless,
the
net
effect
of
saying
$305,000.00
is
excessive
the
most
that
can
be
allowed
for
this
sort
of
injury
is
$200,000.00.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
this
is
where
a
certain
amount
of
expertise
and
experience
as
mr.
justice
fortas
pointed
out
has
to
come
in
to
play
and
sure
the
district
--
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
the
amount
of
the
jury
verdict
was
never
even
at
common
law
exclusively
for
the
jury.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
no,
but
if
the
jury
comes
in
with
the
verdict
of
$1
million
for
a
sprained
thumb.
i
submit
that
that’s
going
to
be
set
aside.
it’s
going
to
be
set
aside
if
the
district
court
doesn’t
set
it
aside,
the
appellate
court
is
going
set
it
aside,
and
if
it
doesn’t
this
court
is
going
to
set
it
aside.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
well,
maybe
it
would
be
inadequate
in
those
circumstances.[laughter]
but
in
any
event
the
--
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
yes,
sir.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
it
was.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
well,
they
didn’t
say
that.
no,
i
can't
say
what
they
thought.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
well,
i
can't
say
they
didn’t
justify
it.
they
took
the
figures
that
have
been
put
into
the
jury
on
loss
of
wages
past
and
future.
and
then,
they
related
the
testimony
as
was
on
the
full
record
and
not
controverted
as
to
the
amount
of
suffering.
and
based
on
that,
they
said
in
their
judgment
giving
a
trial
judge
every
benefit
of
the
doubt
in
his
upholding
the
jury
verdict.
nonetheless,
this
seemed
to
them
to
be
excessive;
so
excessive
as
to
require
reversal.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
i
see
it
and
i'm
not
suggesting
it
isn’t
the
difficult
problem
and
along
the
lines
of
mr.
justice
fortas
as
i
believe
alluded
to
earlier,
trial
judges
aren’t
the
only
ones
that
have
experience
in
jury
verdicts.
appellate
judges
have
the
same
course
of
experience
and
indeed
may
be
and
as
good
of
position
to
view
them.
in
that
connection,
we
--
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
judge
medina?
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
oh!
i've
seen
him
many
times
at
the
courtroom.
i
don’t
know
whether
he
has
--
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
for
trial,
i
think
that
is
correct.
he
never
was
a
--
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
that’s
right.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
i
think
it
depends
on
the
court.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
and
the
state
court
i
think
probably
not
in
the
federal
court
--
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
i'm
suggesting
that
in
a
federal
court,
the
district
judge
may
not
necessarily
get
a
greater
exposure
than
the
federal
appellate
court.
but
i
do
think
--
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
well,
it
maybe
a
question
of
two
people
or
three
people
who
have
not
been
exposed
to
exactly
the
same
problems
as
the
trial
judge
bringing
their
judgment
to
bear
on
it.
not
just
to
second
guess
of
it
but
to
give
him
every
possible
benefit
of
the
doubt
and
in
some
few
instances
they're
going
to
conclude
that
this
was
beyond
the
bounds
of
reasonableness.
we
are
--
we
have
put
into
our
appendix
to
our
brief
a
quite
complete
list
of
jury
verdicts
in
recent
case
and
dollars
that
have
been
awarded.
and
i
think
it
is
from
a
distillation
of
those
cases
that
the
common
law
principles
of
excessiveness
of
verdict
must
be
determined.
as
the
court
please,
in
closing
let
me
suggest
if
i
may
that
i
think
the
second
aspect
of
this
case
that
is
whether
the
appellate
court
should
be
upheld
in
reverse
in
a
district
court
calls
really
for
more
than
most
cases
that
quality
of
judging
that
judge
learned
hand
spoke
up
on
the
occasion
of
his
50th
anniversary
on
the
court.
when
he
said
that
the
judging
was
in
the
nature
of
an
art,
the
judge
has
some
vague
purposes
and
frames
of
references
and
among
these
he
must
choose
but
choose
he
must
do.
now,
unfortunately,
the
choices
that
are
made
here
really
can't
be
proven
by
words
or
numbers
the
way
you
would
prove
a
mathematical
or
a
logical
proposition.
but
i
submit
that
the
manner
in
which
this
district
court
particularly
in
the
light
of
its
dagnello
case,
this
appellate
court
went
about
resolving
this
question
shows
a
thoroughly
objective
and
reasonable
resolution
of
the
interest
of
the
parties
and
should
accordingly
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
just
on
damages.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
just
on
the
damages,
yes
your
honor.
