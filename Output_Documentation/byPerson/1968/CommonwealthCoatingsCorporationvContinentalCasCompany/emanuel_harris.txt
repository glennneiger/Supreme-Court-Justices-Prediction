mr.
emanuel
harris
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
involved
on
this
certiorari
is
the
effect
of
the
failure
of
a
third
arbitrator
in
a
tripartite
arbitration
proceeding
in
departing
to
disclose
prior
business
relations
between
them
whether
that
--
whether
an
award
made
in
such
a
proceeding
is
invalid
under
the
federal
arbitration
act.
the
act
provides
that
the
award
may
be
vacated
where
the
award
was
procured
by
corruption
or
fraud,
where
there
was
evident
partiality
or
corruption
in
the
arbitrators
or
either
of
them
or
where
the
arbitrator
is
guilty
of
any
other
misbehavior
by
which
the
rights
of
any
party
have
been
prejudiced.
these
--
this
case
arises
out
of
contracts
between
the
petitioner
and
the
respondents.
the
petitioner
was
a
subcontractor
of
the
respondent
samford
for
the
performance
of
work,
painting
work
on
five
construction
projects
in
puerto
rico.
the
respondent
samford
was
the
general
contractor.
the
claims
of
petitioner
was
that
the
samford,
although
it
received
payment
from
the
owner
for
the
work
performed
by
the
petitioner
failed
to
make
progress
payments
to
the
petitioner
and
therefore
the
petitioner
abandoned
the
work.
the
claim
of
samford
is
that
the
petitioner
abandoned
and
stopped
work
on
the
contracts.
the
contracts
provided
for
arbitration
of
all
disputes.
the
respondents
binding
companies
were
the
sureties
on
samford's
miller
act
bonds.
the
contract,
as
i
said,
provided
for
the
arbitration
of
disputes
and
the
respondent
bonding
companies
obtained
a
stay
of
the
suit
against
them
under
miller
act
bonds
pending
the
determination
of
the
arbitration.
pursuant
to
the
procedure
established
by
the
contracts,
the
petitioner
and
samford
each
appointed
one
arbitrator.
those
two
arbitrators
appointed
an
arbitrator
by
the
name
of
capacete.
at
the
time
the
arbitrators
were
designated
and
prior
to
the
arbitration
proceedings,
petitioner's
attorney,
mr.
romero
made
an
investigation
to
discover
whether
any
of
the
arbitrators
had
prior
business
relations
with
any
of
the
parties
and
he
found
none
and
none
of
the
arbitrators
informed
him
of
any
such
prior
relations
and
he
states
in
an
affidavit
in
the
record
that
if
he
had
known
about
such
prior
previous
relations,
he
would
asked
a
lawyer,
have
objected
to
the
arbitrator's
capacity.
the
respondents
state
in
their
briefs
throughout
their
brief
that
no
inquiry
was
made
by
the
petitioner,
totally
disregarding
this
affidavit
by
mr.
romero
although
they
devote
about
five
pages
in
their
brief
in
attempt
to
discredit
mr.
romero's
affidavit.
furthermore,
in
their
--
mr.
emanuel
harris
the
affidavit
doesn't
disclose
that
he
asked
--
mr.
emanuel
harris
no,
it
doesn't
say
that
--
it
does
say
that
none
of
the
arbitrators
informed
him.
he
does
not
say
--
the
affidavit
does
not
say
that
he
ask
this
particular
--
mr.
emanuel
harris
he
did.
however,
it
was
admitted
in
the
respondent's
brief
that
capacete
did
discuss
possible
arbitrators
with
mr.
romero
at
the
time
a
vacancy
appeared
in
the
board
of
arbitrators
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
at
the
time,
on
the
request
of
mr.
romero,
mr.
capacete
furnished
a
list
of
lawyers
who
knew
something
about
engineering
cases
and
from
that
list
furnished
by
mr.
capacete,
a
third
arbitrator
was
designated
to
fill
the
vacancy.
now,
capacete
at
that
time
did
not
say
anything
about
his
prior
relations
with
samford.
mr.
emanuel
harris
no,
our
position
is
that
the
arbitrator
and
the
respondent
with
whom
he
had
present
relations
were
under
a
duty
to
disclose
these
previous
relationships
--
mr.
emanuel
harris
that's
right.
and
i
--
our
position
--
mr.
emanuel
harris
no,
our
position
is
that
the
very
failure
to
make
disclosure
constitutes
misbehavior
to
the
prejudice
of
the
petitioner.
mr.
emanuel
harris
on
the
arbitrator.
mr.
emanuel
harris
and
also
on
the
part
of
the
respondent,
because
the
statute
refers
to
corruption
and
fraud.
so
that
you
have
a
double
--
mr.
emanuel
harris
yes.
mr.
emanuel
harris
yes.
mr.
emanuel
harris
and
we
also
and
we
go
further
and
we
say
that
not
only
was
it
misbehavior
on
the
part
of
the
arbitrator
but
that
there
was
a
duty
on
the
part
of
the
respondent
to
disclose
these
prior
relations.
mr.
emanuel
harris
pardon?
mr.
emanuel
harris
as
a
matter
of
law,
that
when
parties
submit
their
controversy
to
an
arbitration
board
and
particularly
to
a
tripartite
board
that
certainly
is
the
duty
of
the
respondent
to
disclose
that
the
third
arbitrator
who's
suppose
to
be
a
neutral
arbitrator
is
in
fact
not
a
neutral
arbitrator.
mr.
emanuel
harris
that's
true,
but
--
mr.
emanuel
harris
oh,
yes.
because
that
is
within
the
provisions
of
the
arbitration
act
that
the
award
was
procured
by
corruption
and
fraud
in
the
concealment
of
the
prior
relations,
so
that
it's
within
the
statute
and
of
those
provisions
that
i've
referred
to.
now,
--
mr.
emanuel
harris
that's
what
the
court
of
appeals
held
--
mr.
emanuel
harris
that's
true
but
the
court
also
held
that
the
circumstances
mr.
justice
fortas
could
also
held
that
under
the
circumstances
and
facts
in
this
case,
it
will
far
better
if
there
had
been
disclosure.
now,
that
answers
the
argument
of
the
respondents
that
the
relations
between
these
two
parties
were
remote
and
isolated
and
insignificant
and
insubstantial.
in
other
words,
the
court
didn't
hold
that
these
relations
were
remote,
isolated
and
insubstantial.
they
held
that
it
would've
been
far
better
if
there
had
been
disclosure
and
that
is
the
whole
gist
of
this
case
that
this
arbitrator
and
the
respondent
should
have
disclosed
this
relation.
now,
with
just
coming
back
to
my
discussion
with
reference
to
inquiring
--
mr.
emanuel
harris
mr.
justice
marshall,
it
will
be
impossible
for
this
arbitrator
to
forget
that.
mr.
emanuel
harris
in
a
hypothetical
case,
if
the
circumstances
were
such
as
to
justify
our
forgetfulness,
there
might
be
some
excuse
or
justifications
(voice
overlap)
but
not
in
this
case.
mr.
emanuel
harris
i
think
that
you
would
have
to
go
to
the
facts
in
the
particular
case.
now,
i
can't
conceive
of
cases
where
the
mere
failure
to
disclose
automatically
would
not
disqualify
an
arbitrator.
mr.
emanuel
harris
pardon?
mr.
emanuel
harris
not
automatic
except
under
the
facts
of
this
case.
now,
here's
the
justification
made
by
the
respondents
in
this
case,
first
they
say
that
the
services
--
i
mean
it's
undisputed
that
capacete
rendered
services
to
the
respondents
for
which
his
company
was
paid.
he
admitted
that.
he
admitted
that
he
never
told
the
petitioner
or
the
other
arbitrators
about
it.
he
admitted
that
he
had
--
in
fact
he
testified
that
he
had
no
reason
to
disclose.
now,
in
the
face
of
that,
and
referring
to
the
nature
of
these
relations,
the
respondent
went
so
far
as
to
impose
a
condition
on
the
petitioner
at
the
time
the
petitioner
was
going
to
fill
a
vacancy
in
the
board
that
they
could
appoint
a
successor
arbitrator
without
objection,
without
the
consent
of
samford
subject
to
the
right
of
samford
to
object,
if
the
person
selected,
had
any
interest
or
involvements
in
the
matters
arbitrated.
in
other
words,
the
very
situation
--
and
mr.
romero
referred
to
that
situation
in
the
district
court
as
evidence
of
a
guilty
conscience
that
samford
was
making
sure
that
the
very
situation
was
not
present
on
our
side
and
then
the
counsel
for
the
respondent
says
that
was
a
very
reasonable
and
understandable
thing
to
do.
in
other
words,
it
was
reasonable
and
understandable
for
the
respondent
to
fail
to
disclose
prior
relations
but
it
was
not
reasonable
and
understandable
for
us,
the
petitioner,
to
object
when
we
found
out
what
the
circumstances
in
the
evidence
was
that
was
not
reasonable
and
understandable
for
us.
mr.
emanuel
harris
they
terminated
about
a
year
before
the
arbitration.
they
lasted
for
five
years
from
about
1959,
1958
to
1961,
about
five
years.
now,
one
of
the
points
that
the
respondents
makes
with
reference
to
these
relations,
they
say
that
the
services
rendered
--
by
the
way,
these
services
aren't
the
very
project,
some
of
them
involved
in
the
arbitration
and
they
say
that
these
services
were
not
rendered
by
capacete
but
rendered
by
his
company.
but
capacete
himself
testified
that
he
personally
using
the
pronoun
“i”
rendered
these
services
and
that
he
owned
this
company
which
they
say
carried
on
to
these
prior
transactions.
on
examination
by
respondents
counsel,
he
admitted
that
he
owned
67%
of
the
company.
now,
whether
or
not
that
his
company
performed
the
services
or
he
performed
them
for
the
benefit
of
his
company
of
course
that's
no
justification
for
fairly
to
disclose
these
relations
if
the
services
were
performed
by
him
by
the
benefit
of
his
company.
certainly,
the
duty
to
disclose
him
arises.
he
can't
hide
behind
the
public
and
say
i
did
this
for
my
company
so
i
don't
have
to
tell
the
petitioner
that
i
have
these
prior
relations.
also
they
say
that
only
$12,000.00
was
paid
to
the
arbitrator
in
his
companies
for
all
the
services
rendered.
at
what
amount
does
the
duty
of
ours
to
make
disclosure,
to
do
as
far
as
contend
that
this
court
should
fix
an
amount
in
dollars
and
cents
about
$12,000.00
or
percentage
of
income
when
that
duty
arises
and
they
also
said
that
the
services
rendered
by
the
arbitrator
were
different
than
the
services
rendered
by
the
petitioner,
the
arbitrator
having
performed
services
in
connection
with
drilling
and
investigation
of
foundations
whereas
the
petitioner's
services
were
for
painting
on
the
very
same
projects.
i
mean,
could
you
have
a
more
ridiculous
justification
or
excuse
for
failing
to
disclose
the
relation?
does
--
do
the
services
rendered
by
the
arbitrator
have
to
be
exactly
the
same
in
kind
and
character
as
the
other
party
before
he's
required
to
disclose
these
qualifying
relations?
the
respondents
in
their
brief
attempt
to
avoid
the
facts
of
concealment
with
euphemistic
phrases
that
they
don't
have
to
volunteer.
there's
no
duty
to
volunteer
information
not
solicited.
but
the
court
of
appeals
at
sum
said
that
there
was
a
difficult
line
between
what
has
to
be
volunteered
and
what
may
await
for
inquiry
but
the
court
of
appeals
held
in
this
case
that
the
information
should
have
been
disclosed.
the
line
that
the
respondents
argue
here
is
that
we
didn't
conceal,
we
just
didn't
volunteer.
i
submit
to
this
court
that
that
certainly
is
no
explanation,
excuse
or
justification
to
the
use
of
semantics
to
justify
the
violation
of
the
obligation
to
disclose.
now,
principally,
with
reference
to
capacete,
he
was
the
third
arbitrator.
he
is
supposed
to
be
neutral.
the
courts
have
made
it
clear
that
arbitrators
designated
by
the
parties
are
expected
to
have
relations
with
the
parties,
even
expected
perhaps
to
favor
the
parties
that
designated
them.
but
the
neutral
arbitrator
is
under
a
strictest
standard
of
impartiality,
freedom
from
bias
and
prejudice.
certainly,
this
state,
it
requires
that
when
a
neutral
arbitrator,
a
third
arbitrator
is
chosen
that
the
least
that
can
be
expected
of
him
is
that
he
should
disclose
facts
which
show
that
he's
not
in
truth
and
in
fact
neutral.
and
the
importance
of
this
appears
in
the
record
because
one
of
the
arbitrators
who
was
appointed
at
the
time
a
vacancy
occurred
testified
that
he
relied
on
capacete.
he
did
not
examine
each
and
every
document
himself
but
relied
on
capacete
for
decisions.
who
can
tell
from
this
record
whether
the
prior
relations
did
not
affect
his
decisions?
mr.
emanuel
harris
those
are
not
unanimous
award
and
this
arbitrator
who
testified
that
he
depended
on
capacete
was
one
of
the
lawyers
whose
names
on
--
who
was
on
the
list
given
by
capacete
to
mr.
romero
as
an
attorney
who
knew
something
about
engineering
services.
indirectly,
capacete
recommended
this
arbitrator
who
said
that
he
depended
on
capacete
for
his
decisions
and
that
emphasizes
the
importance
of
a
third
arbitrator.
now,
the
respondents
contend
in
their
brief
that
an
arbitrator
is
like
a
judge.
an
arbitrator
is
stronger
and
a
more
important
position
than
a
judge.
you
can
appeal
from
a
judge's
decision
but
there's
no
appeal
from
an
arbitrator
on
law
or
fact
and
that's
the
reason
why
the
position
of
the
third
arbitrator
in
this
case
is
so
important
because
there's
no
appeal
from
the
award
on
questions
of
law
and
fact
and
that's
why
the
strict
standard
is
required,
a
stricter
standard
is
required
of
the
third
arbitrator
rather
than
the
other
arbitrators.
the
respondents
in
their
brief
referred
to
the
magnitude
and
intensity
of
hidden
and
active
dispute
between
the
parties
including
many
contested
and
contradicted
contentions
and
complex
disputes.
obviously,
if
you
have
a
failure
to
disclose
and
assuming
that
capacete
willfully
failed
to
disclose,
then
certainly,
the
respondent
willfully
failed
to
disclose,
naturally,
you
cannot
find
in
the
record
positive
evidence
to
show
partiality.
the
very
fact
of
concealment
which
is
undisputed
in
the
record
shows
the
partiality
which
makes
this
award
vulnerable
under
the
federal
arbitration
act.
now,
if
your
honors
please,
these
respondents
say
that
a
setting
aside
of
this
award
would
frustrate
the
purpose
of
arbitration,
which
would
be
to
give
final
and
quick
relief.
the
purpose
of
an
arbitration
is
to
have
an
honest
proceeding.
if
there's
any
frustration
of
that
purpose,
the
respondents
themselves
are
responsible
for
the
vulnerability
and
for
this
tainted
award.
they
have
been
responsible
for
the
thousand
hours
of
work
that
they
refer
to
in
their
brief
and
they
have
subjected
the
petitioner
to
the
tremendous
burden
and
expense
of
carrying
through
an
arbitration
wholly
unaware
of
the
secrecy
and
the
affiliation
and
the
tie-in
between
this
arbitrator
and
the
respondent.
and
notwithstanding
this
failure
to
work,
to
disclose
these
relations
and
these
attempted
justification
for
this
failure
which
absolutely
doesn't
stand
up
morally
or
legally
and
they
object
and
they
say
that
this
--
that
setting
aside
this
award
would
frustrate
the
purpose
of
arbitration
when
they
are
responsible
for
the
facts
which
result
in
this
frustration,
they
actually
complain
in
their
brief
that
we
didn't
pay
our
share
of
capacete's
$3,000.00
fee.
your
honors,
i
submit
that
i
never
--
it's
adding
insult
to
injury,
that's
the
only
way
to
describe
it.
i
submit
that
this
award
is
not
only
immoral,
legally
untenable
and
for
this
court
to
sustain
contentions
that
in
circumstances
like
this
there
is
no
duty
to
disclose
the
prior
relations
would
open
the
door
to
corruption,
so
that
you
couldn't
have
an
honest
arbitration
where
you
had
a
situation
something
like
this.
i
submit
that
under
the
facts
in
this
case,
you
have
a
dishonest
determination
which
this
court
should
not
permit
to
stand.
let
me
give
you
an
instance
of
how
the
record
even
though
it
doesn't
positively
disclose
the
partiality,
how
the
record
discloses
that
there
must
have
been
partiality.
the
total
amount
of
these
contracts
was
$350,000.00.
they
were
paid
about
$200,000.00
leaving
an
unpaid
balance
of
$140,000.00.
the
petitioner
claimed
$113,000.00
for
work
that
it
did
perform,
leaving
about
$28,000.00
of
uncompleted
work.
the
arbitrators
allowed
samford
$158,000.00
to
finish
$28,000.00
of
work.
twice,
does
this
record
show
evidence
of
partiality?
i
submit
that
it
does
and
i
ask
this
court
to
set
that
award
aside.
mr.
emanuel
harris
may
i
have
a
few
minutes.
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
fortas
about
whether
the
district
court
ever
made
any
ruling
with
respect
to
the
duty
to
disclose
because
of
the
closeness
of
relationship.
the
opinion
of
the
district
court
is
printed
in
the
appendix
on
pages
184
and
185.
the
district
court
said
nothing
about
that.
it
did
not
disclose,
it
did
not
discuss
at
all
the
closeness
of
the
relationships
and
the
statement
of
mr.
currie
that
we
abandoned
that
issue
is
ridiculous.
our
whole
case
in
the
district
court,
out
side
of
these
other
objections
was
the
failure
to
disclose
and
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
opinion
said
that
that
was
the
sole
issue
on
appeal
and
was
based
on
that
point
that
we
ask
this
court
to
grant
certiorari.
how
can
mr.
currie
say
that
we
abandoned
that
issue?
now,
with
reference
to
mr.
romero
bringing
a
good
friend
or
mr.
capacete,
mr.
capacete
testified
that
he
was
a
good
friend
of
mr.
romero.
he
know
mr.
romero's
father.
they
belong
to
the
rotary
club
and
yet
mr.
capacete
acting
as
a
most
important
judge
in
this
proceeding
wouldn't
even
tell
his
good
friend
about
his
relations
with
samford.
i
ask
your
honors
if
that
relationship
should
not
have
been
disclosed
between
good
friends,
would
a
judge
try
a
case
before
with
a
good
friend
as
an
attorney
for
one
of
the
parties
without
disclosing
a
prior
relationship.
i
submit
that
that's
the
situation
of
this
case
and
the
award
should
be
set
aside.
mr.
emanuel
harris
oh,
no.
not
because
he
was
a
good
friend
but
because
he
didn't
tell
his
good
friend
what
his
relation
was
with
samford
and
furthermore,
the
mere
fact
that
the
two
arbitrators
designated
by
the
parties
shows
capacete,
does
that
relieve
capacete
from
disclosing
his
relationship
because
the
other
two
arbitrators
picked
him?
but
the
very
fact
that
the
other
two
arbitrators
picked
him
and
that
he
was
employed
by
samford
should
have
emphasized
his
duty
to
disclose
to
the
petitioner
and
the
petitioner's
attorney
his
relations
with
the
very
people
who
by
coincidence,
i
will
assume,
he
became
an
arbitrator
for
in
this
proceeding
because
he
was
chosen
by
the
other
two.
mr.
emanuel
harris
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
involved
on
this
certiorari
is
the
effect
of
the
failure
of
a
third
arbitrator
in
a
tripartite
arbitration
proceeding
in
departing
to
disclose
prior
business
relations
between
them
whether
that
--
whether
an
award
made
in
such
a
proceeding
is
invalid
under
the
federal
arbitration
act.
the
act
provides
that
the
award
may
be
vacated
where
the
award
was
procured
by
corruption
or
fraud,
where
there
was
evident
partiality
or
corruption
in
the
arbitrators
or
either
of
them
or
where
the
arbitrator
is
guilty
of
any
other
misbehavior
by
which
the
rights
of
any
party
have
been
prejudiced.
these
--
this
case
arises
out
of
contracts
between
the
petitioner
and
the
respondents.
the
petitioner
was
a
subcontractor
of
the
respondent
samford
for
the
performance
of
work,
painting
work
on
five
construction
projects
in
puerto
rico.
the
respondent
samford
was
the
general
contractor.
the
claims
of
petitioner
was
that
the
samford,
although
it
received
payment
from
the
owner
for
the
work
performed
by
the
petitioner
failed
to
make
progress
payments
to
the
petitioner
and
therefore
the
petitioner
abandoned
the
work.
the
claim
of
samford
is
that
the
petitioner
abandoned
and
stopped
work
on
the
contracts.
the
contracts
provided
for
arbitration
of
all
disputes.
the
respondents
binding
companies
were
the
sureties
on
samford's
miller
act
bonds.
the
contract,
as
i
said,
provided
for
the
arbitration
of
disputes
and
the
respondent
bonding
companies
obtained
a
stay
of
the
suit
against
them
under
miller
act
bonds
pending
the
determination
of
the
arbitration.
pursuant
to
the
procedure
established
by
the
contracts,
the
petitioner
and
samford
each
appointed
one
arbitrator.
those
two
arbitrators
appointed
an
arbitrator
by
the
name
of
capacete.
at
the
time
the
arbitrators
were
designated
and
prior
to
the
arbitration
proceedings,
petitioner's
attorney,
mr.
romero
made
an
investigation
to
discover
whether
any
of
the
arbitrators
had
prior
business
relations
with
any
of
the
parties
and
he
found
none
and
none
of
the
arbitrators
informed
him
of
any
such
prior
relations
and
he
states
in
an
affidavit
in
the
record
that
if
he
had
known
about
such
prior
previous
relations,
he
would
asked
a
lawyer,
have
objected
to
the
arbitrator's
capacity.
the
respondents
state
in
their
briefs
throughout
their
brief
that
no
inquiry
was
made
by
the
petitioner,
totally
disregarding
this
affidavit
by
mr.
romero
although
they
devote
about
five
pages
in
their
brief
in
attempt
to
discredit
mr.
romero's
affidavit.
furthermore,
in
their
--
mr.
emanuel
harris
the
affidavit
doesn't
disclose
that
he
asked
--
mr.
emanuel
harris
no,
it
doesn't
say
that
--
it
does
say
that
none
of
the
arbitrators
informed
him.
he
does
not
say
--
the
affidavit
does
not
say
that
he
ask
this
particular
--
mr.
emanuel
harris
he
did.
however,
it
was
admitted
in
the
respondent's
brief
that
capacete
did
discuss
possible
arbitrators
with
mr.
romero
at
the
time
a
vacancy
appeared
in
the
board
of
arbitrators
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
at
the
time,
on
the
request
of
mr.
romero,
mr.
capacete
furnished
a
list
of
lawyers
who
knew
something
about
engineering
cases
and
from
that
list
furnished
by
mr.
capacete,
a
third
arbitrator
was
designated
to
fill
the
vacancy.
now,
capacete
at
that
time
did
not
say
anything
about
his
prior
relations
with
samford.
mr.
emanuel
harris
no,
our
position
is
that
the
arbitrator
and
the
respondent
with
whom
he
had
present
relations
were
under
a
duty
to
disclose
these
previous
relationships
--
mr.
emanuel
harris
that's
right.
and
i
--
our
position
--
mr.
emanuel
harris
no,
our
position
is
that
the
very
failure
to
make
disclosure
constitutes
misbehavior
to
the
prejudice
of
the
petitioner.
mr.
emanuel
harris
on
the
arbitrator.
mr.
emanuel
harris
and
also
on
the
part
of
the
respondent,
because
the
statute
refers
to
corruption
and
fraud.
so
that
you
have
a
double
--
mr.
emanuel
harris
yes.
mr.
emanuel
harris
yes.
mr.
emanuel
harris
and
we
also
and
we
go
further
and
we
say
that
not
only
was
it
misbehavior
on
the
part
of
the
arbitrator
but
that
there
was
a
duty
on
the
part
of
the
respondent
to
disclose
these
prior
relations.
mr.
emanuel
harris
pardon?
mr.
emanuel
harris
as
a
matter
of
law,
that
when
parties
submit
their
controversy
to
an
arbitration
board
and
particularly
to
a
tripartite
board
that
certainly
is
the
duty
of
the
respondent
to
disclose
that
the
third
arbitrator
who's
suppose
to
be
a
neutral
arbitrator
is
in
fact
not
a
neutral
arbitrator.
mr.
emanuel
harris
that's
true,
but
--
mr.
emanuel
harris
oh,
yes.
because
that
is
within
the
provisions
of
the
arbitration
act
that
the
award
was
procured
by
corruption
and
fraud
in
the
concealment
of
the
prior
relations,
so
that
it's
within
the
statute
and
of
those
provisions
that
i've
referred
to.
now,
--
mr.
emanuel
harris
that's
what
the
court
of
appeals
held
--
mr.
emanuel
harris
that's
true
but
the
court
also
held
that
the
circumstances
mr.
justice
fortas
could
also
held
that
under
the
circumstances
and
facts
in
this
case,
it
will
far
better
if
there
had
been
disclosure.
now,
that
answers
the
argument
of
the
respondents
that
the
relations
between
these
two
parties
were
remote
and
isolated
and
insignificant
and
insubstantial.
in
other
words,
the
court
didn't
hold
that
these
relations
were
remote,
isolated
and
insubstantial.
they
held
that
it
would've
been
far
better
if
there
had
been
disclosure
and
that
is
the
whole
gist
of
this
case
that
this
arbitrator
and
the
respondent
should
have
disclosed
this
relation.
now,
with
just
coming
back
to
my
discussion
with
reference
to
inquiring
--
mr.
emanuel
harris
mr.
justice
marshall,
it
will
be
impossible
for
this
arbitrator
to
forget
that.
mr.
emanuel
harris
in
a
hypothetical
case,
if
the
circumstances
were
such
as
to
justify
our
forgetfulness,
there
might
be
some
excuse
or
justifications
(voice
overlap)
but
not
in
this
case.
mr.
emanuel
harris
i
think
that
you
would
have
to
go
to
the
facts
in
the
particular
case.
now,
i
can't
conceive
of
cases
where
the
mere
failure
to
disclose
automatically
would
not
disqualify
an
arbitrator.
mr.
emanuel
harris
pardon?
mr.
emanuel
harris
not
automatic
except
under
the
facts
of
this
case.
now,
here's
the
justification
made
by
the
respondents
in
this
case,
first
they
say
that
the
services
--
i
mean
it's
undisputed
that
capacete
rendered
services
to
the
respondents
for
which
his
company
was
paid.
he
admitted
that.
he
admitted
that
he
never
told
the
petitioner
or
the
other
arbitrators
about
it.
he
admitted
that
he
had
--
in
fact
he
testified
that
he
had
no
reason
to
disclose.
now,
in
the
face
of
that,
and
referring
to
the
nature
of
these
relations,
the
respondent
went
so
far
as
to
impose
a
condition
on
the
petitioner
at
the
time
the
petitioner
was
going
to
fill
a
vacancy
in
the
board
that
they
could
appoint
a
successor
arbitrator
without
objection,
without
the
consent
of
samford
subject
to
the
right
of
samford
to
object,
if
the
person
selected,
had
any
interest
or
involvements
in
the
matters
arbitrated.
in
other
words,
the
very
situation
--
and
mr.
romero
referred
to
that
situation
in
the
district
court
as
evidence
of
a
guilty
conscience
that
samford
was
making
sure
that
the
very
situation
was
not
present
on
our
side
and
then
the
counsel
for
the
respondent
says
that
was
a
very
reasonable
and
understandable
thing
to
do.
in
other
words,
it
was
reasonable
and
understandable
for
the
respondent
to
fail
to
disclose
prior
relations
but
it
was
not
reasonable
and
understandable
for
us,
the
petitioner,
to
object
when
we
found
out
what
the
circumstances
in
the
evidence
was
that
was
not
reasonable
and
understandable
for
us.
mr.
emanuel
harris
they
terminated
about
a
year
before
the
arbitration.
they
lasted
for
five
years
from
about
1959,
1958
to
1961,
about
five
years.
now,
one
of
the
points
that
the
respondents
makes
with
reference
to
these
relations,
they
say
that
the
services
rendered
--
by
the
way,
these
services
aren't
the
very
project,
some
of
them
involved
in
the
arbitration
and
they
say
that
these
services
were
not
rendered
by
capacete
but
rendered
by
his
company.
but
capacete
himself
testified
that
he
personally
using
the
pronoun
“i”
rendered
these
services
and
that
he
owned
this
company
which
they
say
carried
on
to
these
prior
transactions.
on
examination
by
respondents
counsel,
he
admitted
that
he
owned
67%
of
the
company.
now,
whether
or
not
that
his
company
performed
the
services
or
he
performed
them
for
the
benefit
of
his
company
of
course
that's
no
justification
for
fairly
to
disclose
these
relations
if
the
services
were
performed
by
him
by
the
benefit
of
his
company.
certainly,
the
duty
to
disclose
him
arises.
he
can't
hide
behind
the
public
and
say
i
did
this
for
my
company
so
i
don't
have
to
tell
the
petitioner
that
i
have
these
prior
relations.
also
they
say
that
only
$12,000.00
was
paid
to
the
arbitrator
in
his
companies
for
all
the
services
rendered.
at
what
amount
does
the
duty
of
ours
to
make
disclosure,
to
do
as
far
as
contend
that
this
court
should
fix
an
amount
in
dollars
and
cents
about
$12,000.00
or
percentage
of
income
when
that
duty
arises
and
they
also
said
that
the
services
rendered
by
the
arbitrator
were
different
than
the
services
rendered
by
the
petitioner,
the
arbitrator
having
performed
services
in
connection
with
drilling
and
investigation
of
foundations
whereas
the
petitioner's
services
were
for
painting
on
the
very
same
projects.
i
mean,
could
you
have
a
more
ridiculous
justification
or
excuse
for
failing
to
disclose
the
relation?
does
--
do
the
services
rendered
by
the
arbitrator
have
to
be
exactly
the
same
in
kind
and
character
as
the
other
party
before
he's
required
to
disclose
these
qualifying
relations?
the
respondents
in
their
brief
attempt
to
avoid
the
facts
of
concealment
with
euphemistic
phrases
that
they
don't
have
to
volunteer.
there's
no
duty
to
volunteer
information
not
solicited.
but
the
court
of
appeals
at
sum
said
that
there
was
a
difficult
line
between
what
has
to
be
volunteered
and
what
may
await
for
inquiry
but
the
court
of
appeals
held
in
this
case
that
the
information
should
have
been
disclosed.
the
line
that
the
respondents
argue
here
is
that
we
didn't
conceal,
we
just
didn't
volunteer.
i
submit
to
this
court
that
that
certainly
is
no
explanation,
excuse
or
justification
to
the
use
of
semantics
to
justify
the
violation
of
the
obligation
to
disclose.
now,
principally,
with
reference
to
capacete,
he
was
the
third
arbitrator.
he
is
supposed
to
be
neutral.
the
courts
have
made
it
clear
that
arbitrators
designated
by
the
parties
are
expected
to
have
relations
with
the
parties,
even
expected
perhaps
to
favor
the
parties
that
designated
them.
but
the
neutral
arbitrator
is
under
a
strictest
standard
of
impartiality,
freedom
from
bias
and
prejudice.
certainly,
this
state,
it
requires
that
when
a
neutral
arbitrator,
a
third
arbitrator
is
chosen
that
the
least
that
can
be
expected
of
him
is
that
he
should
disclose
facts
which
show
that
he's
not
in
truth
and
in
fact
neutral.
and
the
importance
of
this
appears
in
the
record
because
one
of
the
arbitrators
who
was
appointed
at
the
time
a
vacancy
occurred
testified
that
he
relied
on
capacete.
he
did
not
examine
each
and
every
document
himself
but
relied
on
capacete
for
decisions.
who
can
tell
from
this
record
whether
the
prior
relations
did
not
affect
his
decisions?
mr.
emanuel
harris
those
are
not
unanimous
award
and
this
arbitrator
who
testified
that
he
depended
on
capacete
was
one
of
the
lawyers
whose
names
on
--
who
was
on
the
list
given
by
capacete
to
mr.
romero
as
an
attorney
who
knew
something
about
engineering
services.
indirectly,
capacete
recommended
this
arbitrator
who
said
that
he
depended
on
capacete
for
his
decisions
and
that
emphasizes
the
importance
of
a
third
arbitrator.
now,
the
respondents
contend
in
their
brief
that
an
arbitrator
is
like
a
judge.
an
arbitrator
is
stronger
and
a
more
important
position
than
a
judge.
you
can
appeal
from
a
judge's
decision
but
there's
no
appeal
from
an
arbitrator
on
law
or
fact
and
that's
the
reason
why
the
position
of
the
third
arbitrator
in
this
case
is
so
important
because
there's
no
appeal
from
the
award
on
questions
of
law
and
fact
and
that's
why
the
strict
standard
is
required,
a
stricter
standard
is
required
of
the
third
arbitrator
rather
than
the
other
arbitrators.
the
respondents
in
their
brief
referred
to
the
magnitude
and
intensity
of
hidden
and
active
dispute
between
the
parties
including
many
contested
and
contradicted
contentions
and
complex
disputes.
obviously,
if
you
have
a
failure
to
disclose
and
assuming
that
capacete
willfully
failed
to
disclose,
then
certainly,
the
respondent
willfully
failed
to
disclose,
naturally,
you
cannot
find
in
the
record
positive
evidence
to
show
partiality.
the
very
fact
of
concealment
which
is
undisputed
in
the
record
shows
the
partiality
which
makes
this
award
vulnerable
under
the
federal
arbitration
act.
now,
if
your
honors
please,
these
respondents
say
that
a
setting
aside
of
this
award
would
frustrate
the
purpose
of
arbitration,
which
would
be
to
give
final
and
quick
relief.
the
purpose
of
an
arbitration
is
to
have
an
honest
proceeding.
if
there's
any
frustration
of
that
purpose,
the
respondents
themselves
are
responsible
for
the
vulnerability
and
for
this
tainted
award.
they
have
been
responsible
for
the
thousand
hours
of
work
that
they
refer
to
in
their
brief
and
they
have
subjected
the
petitioner
to
the
tremendous
burden
and
expense
of
carrying
through
an
arbitration
wholly
unaware
of
the
secrecy
and
the
affiliation
and
the
tie-in
between
this
arbitrator
and
the
respondent.
and
notwithstanding
this
failure
to
work,
to
disclose
these
relations
and
these
attempted
justification
for
this
failure
which
absolutely
doesn't
stand
up
morally
or
legally
and
they
object
and
they
say
that
this
--
that
setting
aside
this
award
would
frustrate
the
purpose
of
arbitration
when
they
are
responsible
for
the
facts
which
result
in
this
frustration,
they
actually
complain
in
their
brief
that
we
didn't
pay
our
share
of
capacete's
$3,000.00
fee.
your
honors,
i
submit
that
i
never
--
it's
adding
insult
to
injury,
that's
the
only
way
to
describe
it.
i
submit
that
this
award
is
not
only
immoral,
legally
untenable
and
for
this
court
to
sustain
contentions
that
in
circumstances
like
this
there
is
no
duty
to
disclose
the
prior
relations
would
open
the
door
to
corruption,
so
that
you
couldn't
have
an
honest
arbitration
where
you
had
a
situation
something
like
this.
i
submit
that
under
the
facts
in
this
case,
you
have
a
dishonest
determination
which
this
court
should
not
permit
to
stand.
let
me
give
you
an
instance
of
how
the
record
even
though
it
doesn't
positively
disclose
the
partiality,
how
the
record
discloses
that
there
must
have
been
partiality.
the
total
amount
of
these
contracts
was
$350,000.00.
they
were
paid
about
$200,000.00
leaving
an
unpaid
balance
of
$140,000.00.
the
petitioner
claimed
$113,000.00
for
work
that
it
did
perform,
leaving
about
$28,000.00
of
uncompleted
work.
the
arbitrators
allowed
samford
$158,000.00
to
finish
$28,000.00
of
work.
twice,
does
this
record
show
evidence
of
partiality?
i
submit
that
it
does
and
i
ask
this
court
to
set
that
award
aside.
mr.
emanuel
harris
may
i
have
a
few
minutes.
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
fortas
about
whether
the
district
court
ever
made
any
ruling
with
respect
to
the
duty
to
disclose
because
of
the
closeness
of
relationship.
the
opinion
of
the
district
court
is
printed
in
the
appendix
on
pages
184
and
185.
the
district
court
said
nothing
about
that.
it
did
not
disclose,
it
did
not
discuss
at
all
the
closeness
of
the
relationships
and
the
statement
of
mr.
currie
that
we
abandoned
that
issue
is
ridiculous.
our
whole
case
in
the
district
court,
out
side
of
these
other
objections
was
the
failure
to
disclose
and
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
opinion
said
that
that
was
the
sole
issue
on
appeal
and
was
based
on
that
point
that
we
ask
this
court
to
grant
certiorari.
how
can
mr.
currie
say
that
we
abandoned
that
issue?
now,
with
reference
to
mr.
romero
bringing
a
good
friend
or
mr.
capacete,
mr.
capacete
testified
that
he
was
a
good
friend
of
mr.
romero.
he
know
mr.
romero's
father.
they
belong
to
the
rotary
club
and
yet
mr.
capacete
acting
as
a
most
important
judge
in
this
proceeding
wouldn't
even
tell
his
good
friend
about
his
relations
with
samford.
i
ask
your
honors
if
that
relationship
should
not
have
been
disclosed
between
good
friends,
would
a
judge
try
a
case
before
with
a
good
friend
as
an
attorney
for
one
of
the
parties
without
disclosing
a
prior
relationship.
i
submit
that
that's
the
situation
of
this
case
and
the
award
should
be
set
aside.
mr.
emanuel
harris
oh,
no.
not
because
he
was
a
good
friend
but
because
he
didn't
tell
his
good
friend
what
his
relation
was
with
samford
and
furthermore,
the
mere
fact
that
the
two
arbitrators
designated
by
the
parties
shows
capacete,
does
that
relieve
capacete
from
disclosing
his
relationship
because
the
other
two
arbitrators
picked
him?
but
the
very
fact
that
the
other
two
arbitrators
picked
him
and
that
he
was
employed
by
samford
should
have
emphasized
his
duty
to
disclose
to
the
petitioner
and
the
petitioner's
attorney
his
relations
with
the
very
people
who
by
coincidence,
i
will
assume,
he
became
an
arbitrator
for
in
this
proceeding
because
he
was
chosen
by
the
other
two.
