the
--
mr.
harris,
the
first
circuit
does
not
deny
that
in
some
circumstances,
there
may
be
a
duty
on
the
part
of
the
arbitrator
to
make
voluntary
disclosure.
as
i
read
its
opinion,
however,
it
says
that
it's
not
clear
that
in
this
case,
a
relationship
was
officially
closed
to
establish
partiality
as
a
matter
of
law,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
in
other
words,
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
factual
determination
by
the
district
court.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
mr.
currie,
if
there
is
a
question
of
law
here,
i
suppose
it
is
--
it
has
to
me
a
contention
that
in
these
circumstances
an
arbitrator
has
a
duty
to
come
forward
and
make
disclosure
whether
or
not
he
is
asked
questions
or
appropriate
questions
that
they
have
assigned
and
then
even
where
you
have
a
unanimous
award,
there
is
a
per
se
whatever
phrase
of
latin
or
otherwise
one
wants
to
use
in
affirmative
duty
on
the
part
of
an
arbitrator
to
come
forward
with
statements
that
circumstances
that
may
affect
his
qualification.
that's
the
only
issue
here,
as
i
see,
isn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
who
suggested
mr.
capacete
for
the
--
for
this,
the
arbitrator's
job?
justice
abe
fortas
the
other
two,
was
there
--
one
must
have
suggested
for
the
other,
i
take
it.
justice
abe
fortas
is
there
anything?
well,
i'll
put
this
way,
is
there
anything
in
the
record
to
indicate
who
first
proposed
mr.
capacete
for
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
apart
from
that,
the
question
for
us
really
is
whether
the
courts
below
find
that,
i
think
that's
the
question.
and
isn't
it
true
that
the
district
court
found
that
there
was
no
prejudice
or
bias
in
factors
manifested
in
the
course
of
the
proceedings
number
one
and
number
two,
that
the
relation
didn't
find
that
the
relationship
was
not
sufficiently
close
to
require
a
--
the
arbitrators
to
volunteer
the
information?
justice
abe
fortas
did
the
district
court
found
that?
justice
abe
fortas
next
question
is,
did
the
district
court
find
that
the
relationship
was
not
sufficiently
close
to
require
the
arbitrator
to
come
forward
with
a
disclosure?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
currie,
i
wonder
if
you
would
agree
that
it
comes
down
to
something
like
this,
particularly
in
view
of
the
knowledge
that
counsel
for
the
petitioner
had
romero
had
of
mr.
capacete's
activities
generally
that
it's
reasonable
to
assume
that
petitioner
deliberately
chose
not
to
make
inquiry
but
to
rely
presumably
on
mr.
capacete's
general
reputation
as
a
skilled
man
and
as
a
fair
man
and
that
in
those
circumstances,
there
was
no
duty
on
capacete's
part
to
come
forward
with
a
disclosure
unless
in
addition
to
the
standards
of
the
federal
arbitration
act
there
is
some
per
se
duty.
is
that
a
fair
summary?

are
you
suggesting,
you
should
have
disqualified
himself
