justice

may
i
ask
you
mr.
currie?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
that
if
a
man
is
called
on
to
act
as
a
judge
in
a
court
and
he
knew,
the
other
side
didn't
know
that
he
had
had
close
business
connections
such
as
was
alleged
here,
whether
there
is
a
statute
or
not
that
it
will
be
his
duty
to
report
to
that
connection,
what
would
you
think?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
they
alleged
that
it
was
closed.
justice
hugo
l.
black
there's
a
difference
to
me
in
arguing
a
defense
of
what
was
done
if
you
put
it
on
the
basis
that
a
claim,
that
he
was,
had
been
associated
but
it
was
not
substantial
and
one
which
seeks
to
defend
it
without
saying
it
was
not
substantial.
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
understand
here.
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
understand
it,
the
court
below
considered
that
it
was
not
a
sufficient
case
and
he
called
on
to
announce
his
interest
because
it
was
a
small
part
of
his
income
and
you
have
been
--
you
have
argued
that
here.
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
familiar
with
tumey
against
ohio?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
a
case
where
a
judge
in
this
arbitrator
is
a
judge.
of
course,
he's
a
judge
as
much
as
a
judge
of
a
court.
there,
this
court
because
that
judge
had
had
a
small
feel
in
connection
with
the
case,
held
that
it
violated
due
process
for
the
judge
to
try
a
lawsuit.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
why
should
those
arbitrators
be
up
to
as
high
a
standard
as
a
judge,
he
is
a
judge?
justice
hugo
l.
black
alright,
well,
i
suppose
he
said
juryman.
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
will
--
he
was
a
wise
juryman,
he
knew
about
lawsuits.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
he
was
a
brother
of
a
party
in
the
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
remote
was
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
remote
was
it?
how
long
back?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
many
years
had
he
been
handling
cases?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
firm
for
this.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
am
sure
they
have
been
called
to
your
attention
by
the
other
side.
i
am
certainly
almost
as
sure
as
i
can
be,
as
you
would
have
said
of
course,
i
don't
want
this
man
to
ask
if
they
have
objected
on
this
ground
and
you
had
known
that
he'd
be
represented.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
understand
that,
it's
not
your
fault.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that
might
be
true.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
may
i
ask.
would
you
say
mr.
currie
that
mr.
capacete
actually
was
not
chosen
by
the
parties
to
the
lawsuit
but
rather
by
the
lawyers
of
the
parties
to
the
lawsuit?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
see.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
mr.
currie?
justice
hugo
l.

do
you
