justice
byron
r.
white
he
never
asked
the
arbitrator.
justice
byron
r.
white
just
suppose
that
he
asked
--
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
the
arbitrator
justified
that
nobody
asked
him.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
gather
that
your
position
that
it's
other
misbehavior
under
the
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
the
statute
which
you
just
quoted
to
us
speaks
in
terms
of
certain
misbehavior
of
the
arbitrator,
doesn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
apart
--
apart
from
the
position
of
the
contractor
and
any
duty
he
may
have
had.
did
you
--
is
it
your
position
that
the
arbitrator
in
any
event
was
under
an
affirmative
duty
or
otherwise
be
guilty
of
misbehavior,
if
he
did
not
disclose
these
relations.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
what
i've
asked
you
and
this
on
the
part
of
the
--
on
the
part
of
the
arbitrator.
justice
byron
r.
white
independently
of
the
other
party
for
the
proceeding.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let
me
put
it
to
you
again.
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
submitting
to
us
that
without
regard
to
the
conduct
or
the
failure
of
the
other
party
of
the
arbitration
to
disclose,
it
is
misbehavior
under
the
statute
for
the
arbitrator
not
to
disclose.
justice
byron
r.
white
alright.
justice
byron
r.
white
where
did
that
duty
come
from?
justice
byron
r.
white
where
is
that
duty
come
from?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
at
least
--
at
least
your
other
argument
is
based
on
the
statute.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
this
one?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
currie
would
the
connections
which
the
arbitrator
in
question
had
with
your
client
been
such
that
they
would
have
had
to
have
been
disclosed
under
the
commercial
rules
of
the
arbitration
association
under
rule
11?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
thought
it
would
have
been
substantial
for
purposes
of
whether
he
was
even
qualified
but
how
about
the
rule
on
disclosure.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it's
the
kind
that
would
normally
be
disclosed.
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
i
know
but
the
rule
puts
on
affirmative
--
suggest
an
affirmative
duty
on
the
arbitrator.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
except
i
thought
you
just
answered
me
mr.
currie
that
on
this
record,
romero
disclaims
any
knowledge
or
whatever
of
any
activity
of
capacete
for
the
respondent.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
mr.
currie,
do
you
feel
if
there's
any
difference
in
the
standards
it
ought
to
apply
to
any
of
the
arbitrator,
any
of
these
three
arbitrators?
justice
byron
r.
white
stand
on
the
same
footing?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
let
it
be
known
in
this
case
that
you
weren't
interested
in
--
your
side
wasn't
interested
in
the
other
side
replacing
its
arbitrator
with
anyone
who
had
any
business
relationships.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
would
you
say
if
--
would
you
say
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
about
in
this
kind
of
a
contract?
justice
byron
r.
white
your
view
was
of
the
same
standards
applies
to
all
three
arbitrators
when
they
are
appointed
as
they
were
or
here
under
this
