chief
justice
earl
warren
did
i
understand
counsel
who
say
that
this
arbitrator
had
some
employment
in
connection
with
this
total
project
that
is
here
under
consideration?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
let's
say,
he
owned
the
firm,
didn't
he?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
in
post-owning,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
connection
with
this
same
project?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
the
burden
on
them
to
prove
this
or
is
the
burden
on
your
people
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
to
show
that
the
arbitrator
was
not
bias?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no
matter
what
the
secret
relationship
might
be
between
the
arbitrator
and
the
others,
your
side?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
you
mean
by
that
that
it
is
legally
not
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
so,
it's
not
properly
here,
you
say.
chief
justice
earl
warren
so,
mr.
currie
without
regard
to
the
other
merits
of
the
case
that
it's
little
difficult
for
me
to
see
how
you
can
say
that
after
five
years
of
occasional
employment
of
this
arbitrator,
he
was
finally
employed
on
this
particular
job
and
still
you
say
it's
remote,
that's
difficult
for
me
to
see
the
remoteness
of
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
on
the
same
job,
how
do
you
come
that
this
person
is
remote
if
it's
on
the
same
job
that
is
to
be
arbitrated?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
i
wasn't
asking
about
whether
it
was
painting
or
soil
test
but
it's
--
i
was
talking
about
the
remoteness
and
they
did
work
for
you
on
this
particular
job
after
having
worked
for
you
for
five
years
on
other
jobs.
now,
how
can
you
say
that's
remote?
chief
