mr.
overton
a.
currie
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we
do
not
come
today
desiring
to
stand
upon
any
technical
legalism
though
we
do
request
that
the
law
be
applied
to
our
case
and
we
feel
that
the
law
in
this
case
will
not
only
produce
that
which
is
to
be
a
sustaining
of
this
award
but
will
also
do
that
which
is
ethical
and
moral
according
to
the
expectations
of
our
society
in
its
highest
tradition
and
in
as
much
as
there
has
been
some
question
raised
in
the
more
recent
escalation
of
allegations
in
the
briefs
and
the
pleadings
in
this
particular
court
at
this
level
which
are
new
and
different
from
those
raised
in
the
lower
court.
some
of
which
not
only
reflect
on
our
client
but
the
attorneys
who
have
just
been
admitted
to
this
practice
may
as
an
officer
of
this
court,
i
invite
your
deepest
questions
to
the
most
sensitive
areas
on
my
profession
and
practice
and
what
has
occurred
in
this
case
in
any
unreserved,
unqualified
fashion.
first
of
all,
the
merits
of
the
issue
have
been
partly
been
discussed.
may
i
respond
to
that
and
attempt
to
address
this
court
and
establish
that
not
only
were
the
arbitrators
more
than
justified
in
their
award
but
that
the
procedures
followed
were
also
legal
and
ethical
and
proper.
the
subcontractor,
the
large
painting
subcontractor
owned
by
three,
the
record
reveals
there
are
three
owners,
two

involved
in

of
$350,000.00.

we
have
a
box
here,
over
18
inches
thick
of
records
that
were
introduced
in
the
trial
court.
it's
only
part
of
the
evidence
that
establishes
the
back
charges,
every
hour
of
additional
work
required
when
the
prime
contractor
had
to
perform
work
that
the
subcontractor
did
not
perform.
painting
behind
the
bushes,
buildings
had
been
painted
the
wrong
color.
the
subcontract
required
the
subcontractor
to
pay
the
payments
monthly
and
on
time
for
paint
and
supplies
so
there
would
be
liens
against
the
property
or
claims
against
this
miller
act
bond.
instead
of
that,
false
statements
were
turned
in
by
the
subcontractor
saying
payments
have
been
made
to
the
suppliers
and
the
contractor
discovered
there
was
$40,000.00
to
$60,000.00
of
such
paints.
the
arbitrators
in
short
your
honor,
there
is
more
than
abundant
evidence
are
in
this
court
to
establish
a
breach
on
the
part
of
the
subcontractor
which
provoked
the
demand
by
the
prime
contractor
when
the
sub
abandoned
the
work,
even
though
the
contract
provided
in
the
event
of
the
dispute,
the
work
would
continue
and
they
would
immediately
have
arbitration,
each
contractor
would
appoint
an
arbitrator
and
those
two
would
appoint
a
third
and
the
vote
of
any
two
would
be
a
controlling
vote
that
would
be
the
majority,
that
would
be
binding
and
enforced
within
the
courts.
they
abandoned
the
work,
contrary
to
that
contractual
commitment.
we
appointed
mr.
chad
(ph).
we
had
a
blue
ribbon
arbitration
board.
for
30
years,
he
was
with
the
corps
of
engineers
as
a
contracting
officer,
a
graduate
engineer.
opposing
counsel
appointed
a
lawyer
by
the
name
of
mr.
holman.
they
in
turn
selected
mr.
capacete.
we
did
not
select
him.
mr.
capacete,
professor
of
engineering
at
the
university
of
puerto
rico,
60%
order
in
the
largest
foundation
testing
company
in
the
island
of
puerto
rico,
until
1957,
the
only
such
construction
testing
firm
on
that
island,
until
1959,
one
of
two
and
the
largest
and
continues
to
be
the
largest.
since
then,
mr.
capacete
has
become
a
partner
in
an
architectural
firm.
it
does
over
a
million
dollars
a
year
in
gross
volume.
he's
a
senior
partner
of
that
firm,
leading
engineer,
so
outstanding
that
the
parties
have
continually
--
the
petitioner
here
continually
stipulated
that
he
was
honorable,
competent
and
we
are
in
this
situation
your
honor,
there
was
a
complaint
filed
against
us
charging
many,
many
things,
some
12
or
15
grounds
to
invalidate
the
award.
we
thought
that
this
matter
had
been
abandoned
by
judicial
stipulation
that
the
parties
had
abandoned
any
contention
that
they
had
a
ground
to
complain.
the
basis
for
that
is
that
we
find
in
the
record
and
in
our
brief
on
page
38
and
39,
we
have
at
least
some
four
or
five
quotations
from
petitioner's
counsel
stating
for
example.
now,
we
don't
mean
to
say
that
we
believe
the
chairman
acted
improperly
in
any
way
another
statement
from
petitioner's
attorney.
i
would
like
the
record
clear
that
at
no
time
as
mr.
romero
or
myself
accusing
any
of
the
arbitrators
with
anything
fraudulent.
they
--
another
one,
for
example,
this
isn't
an
allegation
of
fraud
against
the
arbitrators,
then
there
are
many
others
that
calls
the
court
to
conclude
in
its
finding
counsel
for
the
plaintiff,
the
petitioners,
this
claimed
any
interpretation
of
bias,
partiality
or
fraud
on
the
part
of
the
arbitrators
involved.
he
seeks
to
overthrow
the
award
on
the
ground
that
samford
should
have
informed
the
plaintiff
that
the
engineering
firm
will
switch
the
arbitrator
involved
was
connected
had
in
the
face
done
some
work
to
samford.
in
view
of
the
fact
that
not
only
has
plaintiff
failed
to
offer
any
evidence
showing
evident
partiality
and
set
arbitrator,
it
also
has
expressly
disclaimed
any
such
imputation
this
subjection
to
the
award
must
be
and
is
hereby
overruled.
the
trial
court
heard
this
case
three
times.
there
were
so
many
objections,
there
were
objections
made
by
the
petitioner
that
the
award
was
void
because
we
met
on
labor
day,
there
were
10
days
of
testimony.
why
did
the
arbitrators
meet
on
labor
day?
because
two
of
the
owners,
our
petitioner
live
in
new
york
and
needed
to
return
home,
decided
to
return
home
and
asked
that
we
meet
on
sunday
in
labor
day.
so,
at
their
request
and
by
stipulation
of
all
parties,
the
arbitrators
did
us
the
service
of
working
on
weekend.
it
was
then
challenged
as
being
illegal
because
it
had
been
sunday
work.
whether
it
was
quasi-judicial
and
whether
allegedly
there
was
no
jurisdiction
for
an
arbitration
board
to
work
on
sunday.
mr.
overton
a.
currie
yes
sir,
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
fortas.
there
is
in
that
instance,
the
very
relevant
question
that
was
raised
earlier
where
is
the
source
of
that
duty
of
the
arbitrator
to
volunteer
information
not
sought
or
the
opposition.
number
one,
every
case
that
has
spoken
of
such
a
duty
that
we
have
found
has
a
reason
where
the
parties
have
themselves
imposed
a
duty
to
speak
without
question.
if
mr.
capacete
had
been
asked,
“tell
me,
have
you
ever
done
work
for
with
samford?
what
are
your
past
relations?”
and
had
he
misrepresented
it,
then
having
made
the
request
for
information,
the
objection
would
have
been
preserved.
no
question
about
that.
mr.
overton
a.
currie
the
other
two
arbitrators,
your
honor.
mr.
overton
a.
currie
i
--
i
do
not
know
which.
mr.
overton
a.
currie
no,
sir.
there
is
a
total
absence
of
information
on
that.
mr.
holman
died.
the
attorney
appointed
by
petitioner
died.
so
--
and
prior
to
that,
there
had
been
another
arbitrator,
mr.
pont
(ph),
appointed
by
the
petitioner
who
resigned.
we
were
having
difficulty
getting
the
petitioner
to
appoint
an
arbitrator
and
those
two
to
select
the
third.
and
i
wrote
a
letter
that's
in
the
record.
it's
the
only
contact
i
ever
had
or
the
respondent
had.
every
contact
we
had
with
the
arbitrators
was
by
written
letter
with
copies
to
all
parties
and
we
asked
mr.
capacete
to
continue
to
serve
when
he
suggested
he
had
to
go
to
spain
for
an
engineering
institute
and
we
waived
the
right
to
go
to
court
and
asked
that
the
vacancy
be
appointed
by
the
court
since
mr.
holman
who
had
been
appointed
by
the
petitioners
had
died,
we
told
him
that
they
could
appoint
anyone
they
wanted
to
so
long
as
they
didn't
have
an
interest
in
the
litigation.
now,
your
honor,
with
reference
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
an
arbitrator
has
a
duty
to
volunteer
any
alleged
disqualifications,
the
cases
cited
by
petitioner
deal
with
the
american
arbitration
association
which
is
used
when
the
parties
in
their
arbitration
clause
referred
to
it
by
reference
and
the
agreement
becomes
jurisdictional.
we
all
know
that
an
arbitrator
have
authority
to
decide
must
be
vested
by
the
agreement
of
the
parties
to
be
bound.
everything
from
the
disputes
cause
and
government
contracts,
your
(inaudible)
decision,
the
bianca
(ph)
decision,
all
arbitration
grows
out
of
the
parties
having
consented
to
as
a
matter
of
contract
to
allow
a
third
person
to
resolve
the
dispute
and
be
bound
by
it
and
when
you
impose
a
condition
in
that
that
you
will
bring
forward
any
information
disqualifying
that
is
the
equivalent
of
asking.
that
is
the
equivalent
of
inquiring
but
we
have
found
no
case
where
an
arbitrator
absent
either
inquiry
or
absent
that
form
of
agreement
that
you
will
use
the
standards
or
you
will
use
the
rules
of
some
association
to
control
any
duty
imposed
on
the
arbitrator.
more
importantly,
even
here,
the
parties
have
expressly
stipulated,
how
can
we
prove
anything?
what
greater
proof
is
there
in
own
demand
than
a
judicial
stipulation
of
innocence?
actually
using
the
word,
that
mr.
capacete
was
guilty
of
no
wrongdoing.
they
have
relieved
him,
they
have
ratified
this
man
even
in
the
course
of
this
litigation.
they
then
attempted
to
shift
the
burden
to
the
respondent.
now,
the
work
less
deals
was
the
evident
partiality.
first
of
all
--
mr.
overton
a.
currie
yes,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
overton
a.
currie
i
think
your
honor
when
you
indicate
close
that
the
present
law
dealing
with
a
direct
interest
that
is
more
than
insubstantial
and
present
certainly
there
should
be
a
duty.
and
even
with
better
practice
--
mr.
overton
a.
currie
your
honor,
in
this
instance,
i
would
just
come
into
that.
first
of
all,
it
was
totally
unrelated.
mr.
overton
a.
currie
yes,
i
was
getting
ready
your
honor
to
deal
with
that
bare
question.
first
of
all,
we
submit
it
was
insubstantial,
it
was
not
close,
it
was
remote,
it
was
casual.
it
was
hold
by
a
period
of
some
five
years.
as
the
brief
makes
an
analysis,
the
total
amount
of
some
$12,000.00,
most
of
that
is
for
another
corporation.
only
some
$2,000.00
to
$4,000.00
is
involved
here,
this
in
the
constituted
less
then
if
you
only
include
the
$2,000.00
to
$3,000.00
over
a
six-year
period.
it's
less
than
1%.
if
you
add
all
$12,000.00,
it
gets
down
to
something
like
one-tenth
of
1%
of
the
man's
business,
mr.
capacete's
gross
business,
one-tenth.
mr.
overton
a.
currie
yes
sir,
that
is
absolutely
correct.
mr.
overton
a.
currie
the
district
court
found
that
there
was
in
fact,
not
only
that
the
district
court
find
that
there
was
not
imputation
even
of
partiality,
much
less
fraud
but
the
district
court
reviewed
all
the
evidence.
we
brought,
we
subpoenaed
all
three
arbitrators,
all
the
record.
mr.
overton
a.
currie
your
honor,
the
district
court
held
that
there
was
no
imputation
thus
expressed
--
disclaim
of
any
impartiality
or
fraud
and
then
held
this.
in
closing,
i
wish
to
state
that
the
record
shows
that
the
arbitrators
conducted
fair,
impartial
hearing,
that
they
reached
the
proper
determination
of
the
issues
before
them
and
that
the
plaintiff's
objection
to
represent
a
situation
where
the
losing
party
to
an
arbitration
is
now
collecting
it
straws
in
an
attempt
to
avoid
the
results
of
the
arbitration
to
which
it
became
a
party.
then
the
circuit
court
of
appeals,
the
court
your
honor,
the
lower
court,
i
believe,
thought
as
we
thought
that
this
issue
had
basically
been
abandoned
because
the
petitioner's
attorney
at
the
last
hearing
said
and
it's
explained
in
the
brief
that
the
ultimate
issue
is
that
they
did
not
have
the
right
to
cross-examine
or
to
--
and
they
objected
to
certain
evidence
and
the
arbitrators
nevertheless
let
it
in.
all
three
arbitrators
testified
that
they
remembered
otherwise,
so
the
petitioner's
attorney
said
it's
a
matter
of
credibility.
i
say,
that
i
objected
and
the
arbitrators
let
it
in.
i
say
that
we
asked
for
time
and
it
was
not
granted.
so,
the
trial
courts
asked
that
the
court
report
to
transcribe
the
record
and
after
reviewing
the
record,
the
three
arbitrators'
was
sustained.
there
was
no
request
for
time.
the
petitioner
asked
for
court
reporters.
they
have
never
paid
them.
they
have
never
even
paid
their
own
attorney
who
served
as
an
arbitrator.
we
didn't
mention
that
they
have
not
paid
mr.
capacete
alone.
there
we
asked
that
the
record
be
studied.
we
have
attempted
to
bring
forward
and
just
see
what
it
is.
mr.
overton
a.
currie
your
honor,
we
believe
under
the
ilios
case
and
the
authority
of
the
gimbel's
case,
both
which
are
cited
that
they
would
be
held
to
be
insubstantial.
it
would
certainly
be
a
better
practice
if
the
information
were
requested.(voice
overlap)
mr.
overton
a.
currie
well,
given
the
gimbel
case,
your
honor,
there
is
one
of
the
arbitrators
was
a
realtor
and
gimbel
was
a
party
to
arbitration
and
there
was
a
duty
to
make
such
disclosure.
there
had
been
business
between
parties.
such
disclosure
was
not
made
and
the
award
was
challenged.
the
court
held
that
first
of
all,
the
relationship
was
casual,
remote
and
not
direct
in
continuum
and
not
such
as
to
suggest
that
there
would
be
a
commitment
of
loyalty
or
partiality
and
that
therefore,
it
was
not
of
the
type
that
is
normally
disqualified.
so
in
that
instance,
holding
it
would
not
be
disqualifying,
then
that's
the
closest.
mr.
overton
a.
currie
i
would
think
under
the
regulation
that
it
certainly
would
be
better
practice
if
our
client
had
been
asked,
or
we
had
been
asked,
“has
it
been
past
business
relations?”
we
certainly
would
have
revealed.
mr.
overton
a.
currie
that
is
correct.
it
imposes
that
and
in
that
case,
your
honor,
the
arbitrator
did
not
do
it
and
it's
significant
that
the
court
held
that
certainly
according
to
arbitration
could
suspect
of
a
large
real
estate
firm
like
the
one
that
the
arbitrator
was
connected
with
could
have
had
business
connections
or
business
dealing
was
a
business
large
as
gimbel
and
there
is
the
implied
imputation
of
knowledge,
construction
of
knowledge.
and
the
ilios
shipping
case
holds
the
same
ruling
that
when
parties
have
sufficient
knowledge
to
put
them
on
notice
as
to
possibility
of
certain
relationship,
then
they
are
charge
with
that
notice.
mr.
overton
a.
currie
this
arbitrator's
firm,
your
honor.
mr.
overton
a.
currie
he
own
60%
something
of
it,
majority
stockholder
and
they
did
--
mr.
overton
a.
currie
yes,
sir.
that
is
--
he
did
the
--
they
did
testing
your
honor
of
sand
and
cement
and
soils.
mr.
overton
a.
currie
not
all,
only
two
of
them.
yes,
there
were
five
contracts.
they
went
out
and
tested
concrete
boring
and
we
think,
your
honor,
that
the
subcontractor
who
was
on
all
five
contracts
who
had
project
superintendents,
who
had
the
equivalent
of
their
general
manager
and
executive
vice-president
down
there
continually
in
contact
with
this
contractor,
why
didn't
they
testify
that
they
did
not
know.
there's
not
one
out
of
order
of
proof
from
any
officer
of
the
corporation
that
they
did
not
know
of
this
other
relationship
which
had
occurred
more
than
a
year
before
this
arbitration
which
would

overton
a.
currie
uniform
--
mr.
overton
a.
currie
the
burden
is
completely
upon
them
your
honor
by
universal
decision.
mr.
overton
a.
currie
the
burden
is
placed
by
law
and
all
decisions
that
we
know
of
upon
them.
the
one
who
is
attempting
to
set
aside
the
award
and
in
this
instance
--
mr.
overton
a.
currie
it
will
burden
would
be
upon
them
to
show
that
they
had
--
there
had
been
some
disqualifying
relationship
that
they
had
no
knowledge
of.
it's
like
a
mutual
mistake
or
some
other
fraud
and
there
was
no
proof
of
it
that
the
officers
of
this
company
did
know
this
and
we
as
you
analyze
a
small
island
of
puerto
rico,
35
miles
wide
and
the
construction
industry
there,
it's
just
--
we
charge
in
our
pleadings
that
they
did
know
or
should
have
known
and
as
i
indicated,
one
reason,
there's
not
more
proof
on
this
record
and
i
believe
a
fair
reading
of
the
record
will
reveal
that
it
appeared
that
this
question
had
been
abandoned
as
other
issues
had
been.
mr.
overton
a.
currie
i'm
saying
your
honor
that
i
believe
that
it
is
(voice

legally
been
surrendered
so
that
there
are
no
grounds
to
object
here.
mr.
overton
a.
currie
no,
sir.
they
have
appealed
and
certiorari
has
been
granted
and
we
--
this
court
certainly
has
jurisdiction
and
is
properly
here
but
on
the
merits
of
the
issue,
the
party,
as
you
review
the
record
is
so
stipulated
as
to
the
integrity,
the
absence
of
misbehavior
that
we
submit
on
the
merits,
they
have
ratified
the
award
and
the
qualification
of
the
arbitrator.
mr.
overton
a.
currie
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
overton
a.
currie
yes,
sir.
we
have
used
the
word
that
it
was
remote,
past,
this
contractor
that
we
represent
was
going
out
business,
had
not
bid
on
any
major
construction
for
some
two
years
and
there
was
nothing
about
the
relationship.
as
we
go
to
--
mr.
overton
a.
currie
i
am
not,
your
honor.
mr.
overton
a.
currie
in
that
instance
--
mr.
overton
a.
currie
your
honor,
in
that
connection,
professor
sturges
who
was
a
dean
of
arbitration
for
many,
many
years
analogized
in
a
case
in
our
--
cited
in
our
brief
that
an
arbitrator
is
more
appropriately
analogized
to
a
juryman
than
a
judge.
mr.
overton
a.
currie
and
under
juryman
--
mr.
overton
a.
currie
under
the
law,
the
universal,
fundamental
law,
as
we
understand
it
your
honor
a
party
must
ask
that
this
qualifying
questions
on
voir
dire
in
allowing
a
juryman
--
mr.
overton
a.
currie
in
most
states,
i
think
as
a
matter
--
that's
a
close
relation.
it
is
not
remote.
it's
definite.
it's
so
involving
that
it
almost
causes
him
by
nature
of
his
very
interest
to
be
a
party
in
interest
to
the
litigation.
the
suit,
very
essence
of
this
question.
mr.
overton
a.
currie
this
arbitrator
was
his
closest
to
me
if
not
closer
and
they
--
we
held,
this
court
held
that
the
smallness,
no
matter
how
small
a
trial
would
be,
we
refuse
those
words,
the
slightest
interest
was
enough
and
it
should
be
revealed
and
it
should
not
ask?
i
think
that
is
correct
when
he
has
a
present
interest,
a
small
one.
but
when
it
is
past,
when
it's
remote
and
the
standards
of
a
judge.
mr.
overton
a.
currie
your
honor
the
party
--
pardon?
mr.
overton
a.
currie
by
more
than
a
year,
in
some
six
and
seven
years.
somehow
it
was
five
years
old.(voice
overlap)
mr.
overton
a.
currie
he
had
--
mr.
overton
a.
currie
he
had
been
making
concrete
borings
on
a
casual
and
irregular
basis
from
time
to
time
over
a
four
or
five-year
period
while
this
contractor
was
getting
started.
he
was
now
going
out
of
business.
the
engineer,
architect
capacete,
had
no
doubt
in
many
contracts
been
designated
like
a
contracting
officer
in
government
contracts
to
serve
as
the
decision
maker
even
though
he
was
paid
by
the
owner
there
of
course
he
has
consent
on
the
party
to
be
bound
by
the
decision
and
that
undoubtedly
explains
why
he
didn't
recognize
there
was
any
duty
to
volunteer.
he
was
not
acting
from
any
corrupt
or
improper
motive.
mr.
overton
a.
currie
your
honor,
if
they
had
objected,
we
didn't
--
mr.
overton
a.
currie
with
reference
to
that
and
the
qualifications
of
the
judge
because
certainly
this
a
proper
question,
the
authorities
indicate
and
professor
sturges
that
the
parties
have
no
choice.
they
are
summoned
and
by
force
of
law
are
compelled
to
submit
their
issues
to
someone
that
the
law
says,
the
government
says,
you
shall
decide
this.
but
in
this
case,
what
happens,
mr.
romero
was
in
the
rotary
club,
the
petitioner's
attorney
and
the
rotary
with
you,
lived
on
the
same
street,
neighbors,
went
out
and
talk
to
him.
the
record
doesn't
show
that
we
had
any
knowledge
that
the
attorney
for
the
petitioner
went
out
and
asked
him,
“who
do
you
think
that
i
should
appoint
as
an
arbitrator?”
we
can
find
decision
saying
that
that
is
condemned,
then
that
would
upset
one.
we
didn't
know
that
he
was
going
out
talking.
mr.
overton
a.
currie
but
--
so
the
parties
have
set
their
standard.
they
have
imposed
their
standards
of
what
constitute
proper
conduct.
mr.
overton
a.
currie
no,
sir.
by
the
arbitrators
of
the
two
parties.
we
appointed
n
engineer,
mr.
chapman.
mr.
overton
a.
currie
thirty
years
as
corps
of
engineer.
this
contractor
appointed
a
lawyer
who
to
service
as
an
arbitrator
not
as
counsel.
those
two
men
selected
as
arbitrators
then
their
lawyer
died,
their
arbitrator
died
and
the
parties
ratified
again
the
appointment
of
mr.
capacete
after
the
subcontractor's
attorney
mr.
romero
went
out
and
talk
to
him
about
who
should
be
appointed
the
following.
mr.
romero's
father
was
a
leading
engineer.
the
proof
shows
that
he
knew
exactly
what
mr.
capacete
did,
that
they
were
neighbors,
that
they
were
friends,
they
were
in
the
rotary
club,
that
mr.
romero's
father
was
a
good
friend
of
mr.
capacete,
that
--
mr.
overton
a.
currie
well,
as
to
the
contrary
of
the
evidence
your
honor.
it
shows
that
mr.
romero
says
he
did
not
know
but
the
evidence
does
not
show
that
the
contractor
did
know.
the
contractor
had
project
superintendents
on
this
job,
they
had
painters,
they
had
a
vice-president,
a
general
manager
down
there
in
puerto
rico.
they
were
in
constant
contact,
$350,000.00
worth
of
work
is
a
lot
of
work
to
coordinate
and
the
painter
was
in
constant
contact
with
them
and
i
repeat
the
record,
we
are
having
to
argue
this
case
by
inference
because
we
understood
and
believe
the
court
understood
that
the
parties
had
abandoned
this
ground.
mr.
overton
a.
currie
your
honor,
it
was
remote
in
time
and
it
was
past
like
the
federal
judge
--
mr.
overton
a.
currie
alright,
i
see
your
honor.
he
was
making
soil
test
and
concrete
--
they
pour
concrete,
the
government
wants
to
know,
is
it
going
to
be
5000,
unrelated
to
painting,
remote
and
didn't
involve
the
question
of
painting.
mr.
overton
a.
currie
the
only
answer
i
can
give
your
honor
is
that
his
work
was
that
of
an
independent
contractor,
irregular,
casual,
routine
testing
for
which
they
charge
a
routine
of
professional
fee
of
breaking
concrete
blocks,
testing
sand
materials
and
his
work
had
occurred
before
this
dispute
arose
and
the
arbitration
occurred.
he
was
not
involved
on
the
job
or
their
when
the
painting
problems,
his
work
didn't
call
us
in
to
pre-judge
the
case,
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
say.
it's
remote
in
the
sense
that
he
was
not
a
witness
to
the
accident
or
the
problem,
or
the
painting
problem
and
that
i
believe
would
--
mr.
overton
a.
currie
that's
a
fair
summary.
mr.
overton
a.
currie
he
disclaims
knowledge
about
these
particular
past
relationships
but
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
fortas'
question,
i
believe
that
is
correct
that
mr.
romero
knew
mr.
capacete
so
well
that
he
accepted
him,
he
and
his
client
as
arbitrator
because
of
their
confidence
in
his
professional
skill,
his
integrity,
his
honesty
and
his
ability
and
they
were
not
interested
in
whether
or
not
he
may
or
may
not
have
had
some
relations.
they
--
they
didn't
even
care
enough
to
inquire.
they
were
so
totally
confident
that
he
would
be
fair
and
competent
and
they
actually
came
into
this
court
and
repeatedly
stipulated
those
various
things.
mr.
overton
a.
currie
your
honor,
the
majority
rule
is
that
all
three
are
--
mr.
overton
a.
currie
--
have
stand
on
the
same
footing.
new
york,
the
party
from
that
and
said
that
they
are
recognized
functional
reality
that
normally,
he
is
a
party,
the
one
they
appoint
is
more
of
partisan
and
is
partial
and
if
the
third
is
the
one
that
should
be
neutral
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
overton
a.
currie
no,
sir,
that
was
anyone
who
had
an
interest
in
the
litigation.
mr.
overton
a.
currie
that
that
incidentally
your
honor,
it
was
part
of
the
--
mr.
overton
a.
currie
we
didn't
want
them
to
appoint
for
example,
since
an
arbitrator
may
be
someone
employed.
for
example,
we
know
on
the
government
the
contracting
officers
or
government
employee
have
interest
in
the
contract
given
the
power
to
decide.
we
know
in
the
standard
aia,
american
institute
of
architects
that
the
owner
of
the
house,
the
architect
placing
and
in
the
standard
contractor
provides
the
architect
can
make
decisions
that
are
binding
on
both
parties
and
so
disqualifications
a
brother,
you
can
agree
that
a
brother
would
serve.
you
could
agree
that
a
wife
would
serve,
and
if
you
waive
that,
that's
not
disqualifying
per
se,
a
party
has
a
right
to
waive
it.
mr.
overton
a.
currie
in
this
instance,
there
was
no
--
the
contractor
did
not
speak
so
who
was
qualified
or
disqualified.
it
merely
said
each
party
would
appoint
one,
knows
to
would
appoint
a
third.
now,
the
law
because
of
the
common
law
arbitration
and
it
be
very
similar
to
that
of
selection
of
jury,
you
have
a
duty
to
inquire.
mr.
overton
a.
currie
yes,
sir.
and
that
in
this
instance
that
a
party
had
the
absolute
right
to
make
inquiry
and
if
there
was
some
disqualifying
relationship,
they
could
object
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
go
into
equity
court
and
ask
that
the
arbitration
be
stayed
and
the
arbitrator
removed
and
another
arbitrator
be
forced
to
or
the
one
party
be
compelled
or
allowed
to
serve.
that
one
would
have
been
necessary.
all
we
were
trying
to
get
is
the
correspondent
reveals
not
only
that
letter
but
another
letter
that's
in
the
file
that
we
were
simply
trying
to
get
that
someone.
mr.
overton
a.
currie
yes,
sir.
you're
correct.
mr.
overton
a.
currie
his
answer
was
that
he
would
not
have
objected
but
would
have
given
or
probably
it
wouldn't
have
forgotten
whether
it
was
(inaudible)
or
conditional
but
it
was
given
his
client
the
information
for
them
to
decide.
thank
you.
mr.
overton
a.
currie
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we
do
not
come
today
desiring
to
stand
upon
any
technical
legalism
though
we
do
request
that
the
law
be
applied
to
our
case
and
we
feel
that
the
law
in
this
case
will
not
only
produce
that
which
is
to
be
a
sustaining
of
this
award
but
will
also
do
that
which
is
ethical
and
moral
according
to
the
expectations
of
our
society
in
its
highest
tradition
and
in
as
much
as
there
has
been
some
question
raised
in
the
more
recent
escalation
of
allegations
in
the
briefs
and
the
pleadings
in
this
particular
court
at
this
level
which
are
new
and
different
from
those
raised
in
the
lower
court.
some
of
which
not
only
reflect
on
our
client
but
the
attorneys
who
have
just
been
admitted
to
this
practice
may
as
an
officer
of
this
court,
i
invite
your
deepest
questions
to
the
most
sensitive
areas
on
my
profession
and
practice
and
what
has
occurred
in
this
case
in
any
unreserved,
unqualified
fashion.
first
of
all,
the
merits
of
the
issue
have
been
partly
been
discussed.
may
i
respond
to
that
and
attempt
to
address
this
court
and
establish
that
not
only
were
the
arbitrators
more
than
justified
in
their
award
but
that
the
procedures
followed
were
also
legal
and
ethical
and
proper.
the
subcontractor,
the
large

we
have
a
box
here,
over
18
inches
thick
of
records
that
were
introduced
in
the
trial
court.
it's
only
part
of
the
evidence
that
establishes
the
back
charges,

hour
of
additional
work

when
the
prime

had
to
perform
work
that
the
subcontractor
did
not
perform.

been
painted

wrong
color.
the
subcontract
required
the
subcontractor
to
pay
the
payments
monthly
and
on
time
for
paint
and
supplies
so
there
would
be
liens
against
the
property
or
claims
against

instead
of
that,
false
statements
were
turned
in
by
the
subcontractor
saying
payments
have
been
made
to
the
suppliers
and
the
contractor
discovered
there
was
$40,000.00
to
$60,000.00
of
such
paints.
the
arbitrators
in
short
your
honor,
there
is
more
than
abundant
evidence
are
in
this
court
to
establish
a
breach
on
the
part
of
the
subcontractor
which
provoked
the
demand
by
the
prime
contractor
when
the
sub
abandoned
the
work,
even
though
the
contract
provided
in
the
event
of
the
dispute,
the
work
would
continue
and
they
would
immediately
have
arbitration,
each
contractor
would
appoint
an
arbitrator
and
those
two
would
appoint
a
third
and
the
vote
of
any
two
would
be
a
controlling
vote
that
would
be
the
majority,
that
would
be
binding
and
enforced
within
the
courts.
they
abandoned
the
work,
contrary
to
that
contractual
commitment.

company
in
the
island
of
puerto
rico,
until
1957,
the
only
such
construction
testing
firm
on
that
island,
until
1959,
one
of
two
and
the
largest
and
continues
to
be
the
largest.
since
then,
mr.
capacete
has
become
a
partner
in
an
architectural
firm.
it
does
over
a
million
dollars
a
year
in
gross
volume.
he's
a
senior
partner
of
that
firm,
leading
engineer,
so
outstanding
that
the
parties
have
continually
--
the
petitioner
here
continually
stipulated
that
he
was
honorable,
competent
and
we
are
in
this
situation
your
honor,
there
was
a
complaint
filed
against
us
charging
many,
many
things,
some
12
or
15
grounds
to
invalidate
the
award.
we
thought
that
this
matter
had
been
abandoned
by
judicial
stipulation
that
the
parties
had
abandoned
any
contention
that
they
had
a
ground
to
complain.
the
basis
for
that
is
that
we
find
in
the
record
and
in
our
brief
on
page
38
and
39,
we
have
at
least
some
four
or
five
quotations
from
petitioner's
counsel
stating
for
example.
now,
we
don't
mean
to
say
that
we
believe
the
chairman
acted
improperly
in
any
way
another
statement
from
petitioner's
attorney.
i
would
like
the
record
clear
that
at
no
time
as
mr.
romero
or
myself
accusing
any
of
the
arbitrators
with
anything
fraudulent.
they
--
another
one,
for
example,
this
isn't
an
allegation
of
fraud
against
the
arbitrators,
then
there
are
many
others
that
calls
the
court
to
conclude
in
its
finding
counsel
for
the
plaintiff,
the
petitioners,
this
claimed
any
interpretation
of
bias,
partiality
or
fraud
on
the
part
of
the
arbitrators
involved.
he
seeks
to
overthrow
the
award
on
the
ground
that
samford
should
have
informed
the
plaintiff
that
the
engineering
firm
will
switch
the
arbitrator
involved
was
connected
had
in
the
face
done
some
work
to
samford.
in
view
of
the
fact
that
not
only
has
plaintiff
failed
to
offer
any
evidence
showing
evident
partiality
and
set
arbitrator,
it
also
has
expressly
disclaimed
any
such
imputation
this
subjection
to
the
award
must
be
and
is
hereby
overruled.
the
trial
court
heard
this
case
three
times.
there
were
so
many
objections,
there
were
objections
made
by
the
petitioner
that
the
award
was
void
because
we
met
on
labor
day,
there
were
10
days
of
testimony.
why
did
the
arbitrators
meet
on
labor
day?
because
two
of
the
owners,
our
petitioner
live
in
new
york
and
needed
to
return
home,
decided
to
return
home
and
asked
that
we
meet
on
sunday
in
labor
day.
so,
at
their
request
and
by
stipulation
of
all
parties,
the
arbitrators
did
us
the
service
of
working
on
weekend.
it
was
then
challenged
as
being
illegal
because
it
had
been
sunday
work.
whether
it
was
quasi-judicial
and
whether
allegedly
there
was
no
jurisdiction
for
an
arbitration
board
to
work
on
sunday.
mr.
overton
a.
currie
yes
sir,
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
fortas.
there
is
in
that
instance,
the
very
relevant
question
that
was
raised
earlier
where
is
the
source
of
that
duty
of
the
arbitrator
to
volunteer
information
not
sought
or
the
opposition.
number
one,
every
case
that
has
spoken
of
such
a
duty
that
we
have
found
has
a
reason
where
the
parties
have
themselves
imposed
a
duty
to
speak
without
question.
if
mr.
capacete
had
been
asked,
“tell
me,
have
you
ever
done
work
for
with
samford?
what
are
your
past
relations?”
and
had
he
misrepresented
it,
then
having
made
the
request
for
information,
the
objection
would
have
been
preserved.
no
question
about
that.
mr.
overton
a.
currie
the
other
two
arbitrators,
your
honor.
mr.
overton
a.
currie
i
--
i
do
not
know
which.
mr.
overton
a.
currie
no,
sir.
there
is
a
total
absence
of
information
on
that.
mr.
holman
died.
the
attorney
appointed
by
petitioner
died.
so
--
and
prior
to
that,
there
had
been
another
arbitrator,
mr.
pont
(ph),
appointed
by
the
petitioner
who
resigned.
we
were
having
difficulty
getting
the
petitioner
to
appoint
an
arbitrator
and
those
two
to
select
the
third.
and
i
wrote
a
letter
that's
in
the
record.
it's
the
only
contact
i
ever
had
or
the
respondent
had.
every
contact
we
had
with
the
arbitrators
was
by
written
letter
with
copies
to
all
parties
and
we
asked
mr.
capacete
to
continue
to
serve
when
he
suggested
he
had
to
go
to
spain
for
an
engineering
institute
and
we
waived
the
right
to
go
to
court
and
asked
that
the
vacancy
be
appointed
by
the
court
since
mr.
holman
who
had
been
appointed
by
the
petitioners
had
died,
we
told
him
that
they
could
appoint
anyone
they
wanted
to
so
long
as
they
didn't
have
an
interest
in
the
litigation.
now,
your
honor,
with
reference
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
an
arbitrator
has
a
duty
to
volunteer
any
alleged
disqualifications,
the
cases
cited
by
petitioner
deal
with
the
american
arbitration
association
which
is
used
when
the
parties
in
their
arbitration
clause
referred
to
it
by
reference
and
the
agreement
becomes
jurisdictional.
we
all
know
that
an
arbitrator
have
authority
to
decide
must
be
vested
by
the
agreement
of
the
parties
to
be
bound.
everything
from
the
disputes
cause
and
government
contracts,
your
(inaudible)
decision,
the
bianca
(ph)
decision,
all
arbitration
grows
out
of
the
parties
having
consented
to
as
a
matter
of
contract
to
allow
a
third
person
to
resolve
the
dispute
and
be
bound
by
it
and
when
you
impose
a
condition
in
that
that
you
will
bring
forward
any
information
disqualifying
that
is
the
equivalent
of
asking.
that
is
the
equivalent
of
inquiring
but
we
have
found
no
case
where
an
arbitrator
absent
either
inquiry
or
absent
that
form
of
agreement
that
you
will
use
the
standards
or
you
will
use
the
rules
of
some
association
to
control
any
duty
imposed
on
the
arbitrator.
more
importantly,
even
here,
the
parties
have
expressly
stipulated,
how
can
we
prove
anything?
what
greater
proof
is
there
in
own
demand
than
a
judicial
stipulation
of
innocence?
actually
using
the
word,
that
mr.
capacete
was
guilty
of
no
wrongdoing.
they
have
relieved
him,
they
have
ratified
this
man
even
in
the
course
of
this
litigation.
they
then
attempted
to
shift
the
burden
to
the
respondent.
now,
the
work
less
deals
was
the
evident
partiality.
first
of
all
--
mr.
overton
a.
currie
yes,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
overton
a.
currie
i
think
your
honor
when
you
indicate
close
that
the
present
law
dealing
with
a
direct
interest
that
is
more
than
insubstantial
and
present
certainly
there
should
be
a
duty.
and
even
with
better
practice
--
mr.
overton
a.
currie
your
honor,
in
this
instance,
i
would
just
come
into
that.
first
of
all,
it
was
totally
unrelated.
mr.
overton
a.
currie
yes,
i
was
getting
ready
your
honor
to
deal
with
that
bare
question.
first
of
all,
we
submit
it
was
insubstantial,
it
was
not
close,
it
was
remote,
it
was
casual.
it
was
hold
by
a
period
of
some
five
years.
as
the
brief
makes
an
analysis,
the
total
amount
of
some
$12,000.00,
most
of
that
is
for
another
corporation.
only
some
$2,000.00
to
$4,000.00
is
involved
here,
this
in
the
constituted
less
then
if
you
only
include
the
$2,000.00
to
$3,000.00
over
a
six-year
period.
it's
less
than
1%.
if
you
add
all
$12,000.00,
it
gets
down
to
something
like
one-tenth
of
1%
of
the
man's
business,
mr.
capacete's
gross
business,
one-tenth.
mr.
overton
a.
currie
yes
sir,
that
is
absolutely
correct.
mr.
overton
a.
currie
the
district
court
found
that
there
was
in
fact,
not
only
that
the
district
court
find
that
there
was
not
imputation
even
of
partiality,
much
less
fraud
but
the
district
court
reviewed
all
the
evidence.
we
brought,
we
subpoenaed
all
three
arbitrators,
all
the
record.
mr.
overton
a.
currie
your
honor,
the
district
court
held
that
there
was
no
imputation
thus
expressed
--
disclaim
of
any
impartiality
or
fraud
and
then
held
this.
in
closing,
i
wish
to
state
that
the
record
shows
that
the
arbitrators
conducted
fair,
impartial
hearing,
that
they
reached
the
proper
determination
of
the
issues
before
them
and
that
the
plaintiff's
objection
to
represent
a
situation
where
the
losing
party
to
an
arbitration
is
now
collecting
it
straws
in
an
attempt
to
avoid
the
results
of
the
arbitration
to
which
it
became
a
party.
then
the
circuit
court
of
appeals,
the
court
your
honor,
the
lower
court,
i
believe,
thought
as
we
thought
that
this
issue
had
basically
been
abandoned
because
the
petitioner's
attorney
at
the
last
hearing
said
and
it's
explained
in
the
brief
that
the
ultimate
issue
is
that
they
did
not
have
the
right
to
cross-examine
or
to
--
and
they
objected
to
certain
evidence
and
the
arbitrators
nevertheless
let
it
in.
all
three
arbitrators
testified
that
they
remembered
otherwise,
so
the
petitioner's
attorney
said
it's
a
matter
of
credibility.
i
say,
that
i
objected
and
the
arbitrators
let
it
in.
i
say
that
we
asked
for
time
and
it
was
not
granted.
so,
the
trial
courts
asked
that
the
court
report
to
transcribe
the
record
and
after
reviewing
the
record,
the
three
arbitrators'
was
sustained.
there
was
no
request
for
time.
the
petitioner
asked
for
court
reporters.
they
have
never
paid
them.
they
have
never
even
paid
their
own
attorney
who
served
as
an
arbitrator.
we
didn't
mention
that
they
have
not
paid
mr.
capacete
alone.
there
we
asked
that
the
record
be
studied.
we
have
attempted
to
bring
forward
and
just
see
what
it
is.
mr.
overton
a.
currie
your
honor,
we
believe
under
the
ilios
case
and
the
authority
of
the
gimbel's
case,
both
which
are
cited
that
they
would
be
held
to
be
insubstantial.
it
would
certainly
be
a
better
practice
if
the
information
were
requested.(voice
overlap)
mr.
overton
a.
currie
well,
given
the
gimbel
case,
your
honor,
there
is
one
of
the
arbitrators
was
a
realtor
and
gimbel
was
a
party
to
arbitration
and
there
was
a
duty
to
make
such
disclosure.
there
had
been
business
between
parties.
such
disclosure
was
not
made
and
the
award
was
challenged.
the
court
held
that
first
of
all,
the
relationship
was
casual,
remote
and
not
direct
in
continuum
and
not
such
as
to
suggest
that
there
would
be
a
commitment
of
loyalty
or
partiality
and
that
therefore,
it
was
not
of
the
type
that
is
normally
disqualified.
so
in
that
instance,
holding
it
would
not
be
disqualifying,
then
that's
the
closest.
mr.
overton
a.
currie
i
would
think
under
the
regulation
that
it
certainly
would
be
better
practice
if
our
client
had
been
asked,
or
we
had
been
asked,
“has
it
been
past
business
relations?”
we
certainly
would
have
revealed.
mr.
overton
a.
currie
that
is
correct.
it
imposes
that
and
in
that
case,
your
honor,
the
arbitrator
did
not
do
it
and
it's
significant
that
the
court
held
that
certainly
according
to
arbitration
could
suspect
of
a
large
real
estate
firm
like
the
one
that
the
arbitrator
was
connected
with
could
have
had
business
connections
or
business
dealing
was
a
business
large
as
gimbel
and
there
is
the
implied
imputation
of
knowledge,
construction
of
knowledge.
and
the
ilios
shipping
case
holds
the
same
ruling
that
when
parties
have
sufficient
knowledge
to
put
them
on
notice
as
to
possibility
of
certain
relationship,
then
they
are
charge
with
that
notice.
mr.
overton
a.
currie
this
arbitrator's
firm,
your
honor.
mr.
overton
a.
currie
he
own
60%
something
of
it,
majority
stockholder
and
they
did
--
mr.
overton
a.
currie
yes,
sir.
that
is
--
he
did
the
--
they
did
testing
your
honor
of
sand
and
cement
and
soils.
mr.
overton
a.
currie
not
all,
only
two
of
them.
yes,
there
were
five
contracts.
they
went
out
and
tested
concrete
boring
and
we
think,
your
honor,
that
the
subcontractor
who
was
on
all
five
contracts
who
had
project
superintendents,
who
had
the
equivalent
of
their
general
manager
and
executive
vice-president
down
there
continually
in
contact
with
this
contractor,
why
didn't
they
testify
that
they
did
not
know.
there's
not
one
out
of
order
of
proof
from
any
officer
of
the
corporation
that
they
did
not
know
of
this
other
relationship
which
had
occurred
more
than
a
year
before
this
arbitration
which
would
--
mr.
overton
a.
currie
uniform
--
mr.
overton
a.
currie
the
burden
is
completely
upon
them
your
honor
by
universal
decision.
mr.
overton
a.
currie
the
burden
is
placed
by
law
and
all
decisions
that
we
know
of
upon
them.
the
one
who
is
attempting
to
set
aside
the
award
and
in
this
instance
--
mr.
overton
a.
currie
it
will
burden
would
be
upon
them
to
show
that
they
had
--
there
had
been
some
disqualifying
relationship
that
they
had
no
knowledge
of.
it's
like
a
mutual
mistake
or
some
other
fraud
and
there
was
no
proof
of
it
that
the
officers
of
this
company
did
know
this
and
we
as
you
analyze
a
small
island
of
puerto
rico,
35
miles
wide
and
the
construction
industry
there,
it's
just
--
we
charge
in
our
pleadings
that
they
did
know
or
should
have
known
and
as
i
indicated,
one
reason,
there's
not
more
proof
on
this
record
and
i
believe
a
fair
reading
of
the
record
will
reveal
that
it
appeared
that
this
question
had
been
abandoned
as
other
issues
had
been.
mr.
overton
a.
currie
i'm
saying
your
honor
that
i
believe
that
it
is
(voice
overlap)
legally
been
surrendered
so
that
there
are
no
grounds
to
object
here.
mr.
overton
a.
currie
no,
sir.
they
have
appealed
and
certiorari
has
been
granted
and
we
--
this
court
certainly
has
jurisdiction
and
is
properly
here
but
on
the
merits
of
the
issue,
the
party,
as
you
review
the
record
is
so
stipulated
as
to
the
integrity,
the
absence
of
misbehavior
that
we
submit
on
the
merits,
they
have
ratified
the
award
and
the
qualification
of
the
arbitrator.
mr.
overton
a.
currie
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
overton
a.
currie
yes,
sir.
we
have
used
the
word
that
it
was
remote,
past,
this
contractor
that
we
represent
was
going
out
business,
had
not
bid
on
any
major
construction
for
some
two
years
and
there
was
nothing
about
the
relationship.
as
we
go
to
--
mr.
overton
a.
currie
i
am
not,
your
honor.
mr.
overton
a.
currie
in
that
instance
--
mr.
overton
a.
currie
your
honor,
in
that
connection,
professor
sturges
who
was
a
dean
of
arbitration
for
many,
many
years
analogized
in
a
case
in
our
--
cited
in
our
brief
that
an
arbitrator
is
more
appropriately
analogized
to
a
juryman
than
a
judge.
mr.
overton
a.
currie
and
under
juryman
--
mr.
overton
a.
currie
under
the
law,
the
universal,
fundamental
law,
as
we
understand
it
your
honor
a
party
must
ask
that
this
qualifying
questions
on
voir
dire
in
allowing
a
juryman
--
mr.
overton
a.
currie
in
most
states,
i
think
as
a
matter
--
that's
a
close
relation.
it
is
not
remote.
it's
definite.
it's
so
involving
that
it
almost
causes
him
by
nature
of
his
very
interest
to
be
a
party
in
interest
to
the
litigation.
the
suit,
very
essence
of
this
question.
mr.
overton
a.
currie
this
arbitrator
was
his
closest
to
me
if
not
closer
and
they
--
we
held,
this
court
held
that
the
smallness,
no
matter
how
small
a
trial
would
be,
we
refuse
those
words,
the
slightest
interest
was
enough
and
it
should
be
revealed
and
it
should
not
ask?
i
think
that
is
correct
when
he
has
a
present
interest,
a
small
one.
but
when
it
is
past,
when
it's
remote
and
the
standards
of
a
judge.
mr.
overton
a.
currie
your
honor
the
party
--
pardon?
mr.
overton
a.
currie
by
more
than
a
year,
in
some
six
and
seven
years.
somehow
it
was
five
years
old.(voice

mr.
overton
a.
currie
he
had
--
mr.
overton
a.
currie
he
had
been
making
concrete
borings
on
a
casual
and
irregular
basis
from
time
to
time
over
a
four
or
five-year
period
while
this
contractor
was
getting
started.
he
was
now
going
out
of
business.
the
engineer,
architect
capacete,
had
no
doubt
in
many
contracts
been
designated
like
a
contracting
officer
in
government
contracts
to
serve
as
the
decision
maker
even
though
he
was
paid
by
the
owner
there
of
course
he
has
consent
on
the
party
to
be
bound
by
the
decision
and
that
undoubtedly
explains
why
he
didn't
recognize
there
was
any
duty
to
volunteer.
he
was
not
acting
from
any
corrupt
or
improper
motive.
mr.
overton
a.
currie
your
honor,
if
they
had
objected,
we
didn't
--
mr.
overton
a.
currie
with
reference
to
that
and
the
qualifications
of
the
judge
because
certainly
this
a
proper
question,
the
authorities
indicate
and
professor
sturges
that
the
parties
have
no
choice.
they
are
summoned
and
by
force
of
law
are
compelled
to
submit
their
issues
to
someone
that
the
law
says,
the
government
says,
you
shall
decide
this.
but
in
this
case,
what
happens,
mr.
romero
was
in
the
rotary
club,
the
petitioner's
attorney
and
the
rotary
with
you,
lived
on
the
same
street,
neighbors,
went
out
and
talk
to
him.
the
record
doesn't
show
that
we
had
any
knowledge
that
the
attorney
for
the
petitioner
went
out
and
asked
him,
“who
do
you
think
that
i
should
appoint
as
an
arbitrator?”
we
can
find
decision
saying
that
that
is
condemned,
then
that
would
upset
one.
we
didn't
know
that
he
was
going
out
talking.
mr.
overton
a.
currie
but
--
so
the
parties
have
set
their
standard.
they
have
imposed
their
standards
of
what
constitute
proper
conduct.
mr.
overton
a.
currie
no,
sir.
by
the
arbitrators
of
the
two
parties.
we
appointed
n
engineer,
mr.
chapman.
mr.
overton
a.
currie
thirty
years
as
corps
of
engineer.
this
contractor
appointed
a
lawyer
who
to
service
as
an
arbitrator
not
as
counsel.
those
two
men
selected
as
arbitrators
then
their
lawyer
died,
their
arbitrator
died
and
the
parties
ratified
again
the
appointment
of
mr.
capacete
after
the
subcontractor's
attorney
mr.
romero
went
out
and
talk
to
him
about
who
should
be
appointed
the
following.
mr.
romero's
father
was
a
leading
engineer.
the
proof
shows
that
he
knew
exactly
what
mr.
capacete
did,
that
they
were
neighbors,
that
they
were
friends,
they
were
in
the
rotary
club,
that
mr.
romero's
father
was
a
good
friend
of
mr.
capacete,
that
--
mr.
overton
a.
currie
well,
as
to
the
contrary
of
the
evidence
your
honor.
it
shows
that
mr.
romero
says
he
did
not
know
but
the
evidence
does
not
show
that
the
contractor
did
know.
the
contractor
had
project
superintendents
on
this
job,
they
had
painters,
they
had
a
vice-president,
a
general
manager
down
there
in
puerto
rico.
they
were
in
constant
contact,
$350,000.00
worth
of
work
is
a
lot
of
work
to
coordinate
and
the
painter
was
in
constant
contact
with
them
and
i
repeat
the
record,
we
are
having
to
argue
this
case
by
inference
because
we
understood
and
believe
the
court
understood
that
the
parties
had
abandoned
this
ground.
mr.
overton
a.
currie
your
honor,
it
was
remote
in
time
and
it
was
past
like
the
federal
judge
--
mr.
overton
a.
currie
alright,
i
see
your
honor.
he
was
making
soil
test
and
concrete
--
they
pour
concrete,
the
government
wants
to
know,
is
it
going
to
be
5000,
unrelated
to
painting,
remote
and
didn't
involve
the
question
of
painting.
mr.
overton
a.
currie
the
only
answer
i
can
give
your
honor
is
that
his
work
was
that
of
an
independent
contractor,
irregular,
casual,
routine
testing
for
which
they
charge
a
routine
of
professional
fee
of
breaking
concrete
blocks,
testing
sand
materials
and
his
work
had
occurred
before
this
dispute
arose
and
the
arbitration
occurred.
he
was
not
involved
on
the
job
or
their
when
the
painting
problems,
his
work
didn't
call
us
in
to
pre-judge
the
case,
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
say.
it's
remote
in
the
sense
that
he
was
not
a
witness
to
the
accident
or
the
problem,
or
the
painting
problem
and
that
i
believe
would
--
mr.
overton
a.
currie
that's
a
fair
summary.
mr.
overton
a.
currie
he
disclaims
knowledge
about
these
particular
past
relationships
but
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
fortas'
question,
i
believe
that
is
correct
that
mr.
romero
knew
mr.
capacete
so
well
that
he
accepted
him,
he
and
his
client
as
arbitrator
because
of
their
confidence
in
his
professional
skill,
his
integrity,
his
honesty
and
his
ability
and
they
were
not
interested
in
whether
or
not
he
may
or
may
not
have
had
some
relations.
they
--
they
didn't
even
care
enough
to
inquire.
they
were
so
totally
confident
that
he
would
be
fair
and
competent
and
they
actually
came
into
this
court
and
repeatedly
stipulated
those
various
things.
mr.
overton
a.
currie
your
honor,
the
majority
rule
is
that
all
three
are
--
mr.
overton
a.
currie
--
have
stand
on
the
same
footing.
new
york,
the
party
from
that
and
said
that
they
are
recognized
functional
reality
that
normally,
he
is
a
party,
the
one
they
appoint
is
more
of
partisan
and
is
partial
and
if
the
third
is
the
one
that
should
be
neutral
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
overton
a.
currie
no,
sir,
that
was
anyone
who
had
an
interest
in
the
litigation.
mr.
overton
a.
currie
that
that
incidentally
your
honor,
it
was
part
of
the
--
mr.
overton
a.
currie
we
didn't
want
them
to
appoint
for
example,
since
an
arbitrator
may
be
someone
employed.
for
example,
we
know
on
the
government
the
contracting
officers
or
government
employee
have
interest
in
the
contract
given
the
power
to
decide.
we
know
in
the
standard
aia,
american
institute
of
architects
that
the
owner
of
the
house,
the
architect
placing
and
in
the
standard
contractor
provides
the
architect
can
make
decisions
that
are
binding
on
both
parties
and
so
disqualifications
a
brother,
you
can
agree
that
a
brother
would
serve.
you
could
agree
that
a
wife
would
serve,
and
if
you
waive
that,
that's
not
disqualifying
per
se,
a
party
has
a
right
to
waive
it.
mr.
overton
a.
currie
in
this
instance,
there
was
no
--
the
contractor
did
not
speak
so
who
was
qualified
or
disqualified.
it
merely
said
each
party
would
appoint
one,
knows
to
would
appoint
a
third.
now,
the
law
because
of
the
common
law
arbitration
and
it
be
very
similar
to
that
of
selection
of
jury,
you
have
a
duty
to
inquire.
mr.
overton
a.
currie
yes,
sir.
and
that
in
this
instance
that
a
party
had
the
absolute
right
to
make
inquiry
and
if
there
was
some
disqualifying
relationship,
they
could
object
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
go
into
equity
court
and
ask
that
the
arbitration
be
stayed
and
the
arbitrator
removed
and
another
arbitrator
be
forced
to
or
the
one
party
be
compelled
or
allowed
to
serve.
that
one
would
have
been
necessary.
all
we
were
trying
to
get
is
the
correspondent
reveals
not
only
that
letter
but
another
letter
that's
in
the
file
that
we
were
simply
trying
to
get
that
someone.
mr.
overton
a.
currie
yes,
sir.
you're
correct.
mr.
overton
a.
currie
his
answer
was
that
he
would
not
have
objected
but
would
have
given
or
probably
it
wouldn't
have
forgotten
whether
it
was
(inaudible)
or
conditional
but
it
was
given
his
client
the
information
for
them
to
decide.
thank
you.
