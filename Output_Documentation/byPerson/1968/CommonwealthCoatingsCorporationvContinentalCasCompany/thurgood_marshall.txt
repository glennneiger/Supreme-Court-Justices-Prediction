mr.
harris,
what
would
happen
if
the
arbitrator
in
good
faith
forgot
and
later
on
remembered,
would
you
upset
the
whole
award?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i'm
not
talking
about
this
case.
i'm
talking
about
a
hypothetical.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i'm
just
saying
that
maybe
you're
going
too
far
in
making
just
a
flat
rule
that
if
a
neutral
arbitrator
has
at
anytime
under
any
circumstances
in
the
past,
and
any
deal
as
with
one
of
them
that
in
and
of
itself,
is
sufficient
to
offset
in
the
rule.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i'm
not
asking
for
pro
se
rule?
justice
thurgood
marshall

not
asking
for
automatic
pro
say
rule,
are
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
does
that
mean?
before
its
left,
would
you
find
it?
