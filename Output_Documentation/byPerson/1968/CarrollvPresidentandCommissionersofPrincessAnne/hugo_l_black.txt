justice

how
does
the
rule
read?
justice
hugo
l.
black
were
all
these
people
served
in
times
that
they
could
have
done
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
if
they
--
but
if
they
violate
the
injunction,
haven't
this
court
said
that
they
can
be
imprisoned
for
it.
that
they
should
have
gone
into
the
courts
to
vindicate
their
rights
rather
than
to
violate
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
suppose
on
this
temporary
restraining
order
if
they
had
gone
to
the
court
within
two
days
afterwards,
and
the
lower
court
had
decided
against
them.
could
they
then
violate
it
and
come
to
this
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
is
it
your
position
that
if
they
did
expire
in
that
10
days
that
it
would
then
be
moot?
justice
hugo
l.
black
with
--
but
without
the
court
deciding
it,
it
would
be
moot.
justice
hugo
l.
black
no,
they
have
to
--
the
respondents
have
to
go
to
the
court
as
to
contest
a
temporary
restraining
order.
justice
hugo
l.
black
within
two
days?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
suppose
within
the
remaining
eight
days,
the
court
did
not
decide
it.
would
it
then
become
moot?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
--
will
be
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
--
but
you
said
at
that
time,
it
was
(inaudible),
that
a
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
after
the
10
days?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
how
then
could
a
person
ever
get
a
decision?
from
one
year,
one
year,
higher
court's,
on
a
temporary
restraining
order
of
that
kind,
would
it
be
possible
for
them
to
get
in
the
eight
days
so
they
are
available?
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
there
is
absolutely
no
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
a
matter
of
fact,
in
the
almost
always
a
court
could
grant
a
10-day
restraining
order
and
it
will
become
moot
before
those
any
decision
in
the
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
beg
your
pardon?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so,
there's
no
way
that
a
man
could
protect
his
constitution
rights
except
by
violating
the
injunction?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
as
you
said
a
little
while
ago,
you
thought
that
was
the
way
for
him
to
do
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
the
proceeding
based
only
in
this
statute
at
all?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
the
threat?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
suppose
there
is
substantially
against
blowing
up
a
town.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
that.
i'm
just
saying
though
there
was
--
is
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
they
refer
in
the
statute
at
all
for
the
people
violating
any
law
and
holding
a
meeting?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
about
the
streets?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
any
state
law
against
congregating
on
it
or
speaking
on
it
or
having
meetings
on
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
your
injunction
was
not
based
on
the
blocking
of
the
streets?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
does
the
rule
read?
justice
hugo
l.
black
were
all
these
people
served
in
times
that
they

have
done

they

then
is
it

that
