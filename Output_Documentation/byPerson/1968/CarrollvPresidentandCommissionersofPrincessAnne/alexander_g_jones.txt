mr.

mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
irony
inherent
in
this
case
your
honors
are
too
numerous
and
too
striking
to
bear
further
comment.
i
would
like
to
restrict
my
remarks
to
the
clear
and
present
danger
as
they
existed
in
princess
anne
in
august
of
1966.
this
was
summarized
by
judge
farnan
who
wrote
the
unanimous
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland
in
this
case,
at

and

not
under

circumstances.
mr.
alexander
g.
jones
yes
sir
and
i
will
try.
judge
farnan
in
his
opinion
said,
“the
speeches
delivered
by
the
appellants
must
not
be
judged
as
they
abstractly
read
or
sound
in
the
sequestered
atmosphere
of
judicial
chambers.
but
with
the
realization
that
they
were
in
the
nature
of
a
hoorang,
delivered
in
the
humidity
of
a
tired
august
night
from
the
courthouse
steps
of
a
county
sit
whose
people
were
not
strangers
to
racial
violence.”
we
urged
that
this
rally
held
on
august
6
must
be
viewed
in
the
light
of
existing
circumstance
and
that
the
appellants
by
their
own
words
must
be
regarded
as
highly
dangerous
racial
and
religious
bigots,
deliberately
operating
in
the
atmosphere
of
ignorance
and
prejudice
for
the
purpose
of
inciting
hatred,
strife
and
disorder.
and
my
little
town
of
princess
anne
to
its
eternal
shame
first
came
notoriety
as
the
seen
at
maryland's
last
lynching
in
1933,
a
fact
which
was
not
lost
upon
the
appellants.
the
town
next
to
achieve
national
prominence
has
a
local
of
serious
racial
disturbances
in
february
of
1964.
the
implication
that
this
had
since
changed
in
all
that
becomes
sweetness
and
light
was
news
to
may
this
morning,
because
i
have
to
serve
as
chairman
of
the
biracial
commission
in
this
community
during
this
time.
we
submit
that
it
was
mere
chance
that
brought
the
appellants
to
princess
anne
on
august
6
'66
but
rather
that
this
small
town
of
the
many
in
maryland
that
they
may
have
visited
afforded
the
best
opportunity
for
the
spread
of
their
gospel
and
hatred.
they
recently
arrived
from
what
they
must
have
considered
a
triumphant
appearance
in
baltimore
city.
an
appearance,
which
resulted
in
an
injunction
against
they
return
and
convictions
on
several
criminal
counts.
we
submit
further
that
in
these
days
of
mass
communications
for
the
press,
the
radio,
on
the
tv,
there
is
no
such
thing
as
an
isolated
racial
incident.

which
have
previously
experience
similar
cases

was
set

clearly
enough
by
them

cumulative

nor
was

on
the

for
these
people
to
come
to

anne
in
the
atmosphere,
which
then
existed,
was
fire
in
a
crowded
theatre.
it
was
a
match
in

there
is
direct
test
among
in
the

from
colonel

that

on

of

that

or
did
in
fact
hear
this
tape
before
he
signed
the

it

played
for
him
in
his

room
in
his
home.
and
after
he
heard
the
tape,
he
signed
the
order
granting
the
original
injunction.
it
was
a
mixed
crowd
in
roughly
the
same
proportion
as
a
population
of
our
county
in
town
is
mixed.
it
was
an
ugly
crowd.
the
situation
was
ripe
for
violence
and
that
is
precisely
why
the
petitioners
were
in
princess
anne
at
that
time
and
on
that
date.
of
all
the
small
towns
in
maryland,
they
could
have
chosen,
they
picked
this
one
as
the
one
best
suited
to
their
objectives.
and
we
submit
that
there
was
a
clear
and
present
danger
and
at
the
presence
of
the
police
on
the
scene,
followed
immediately
by
the
injunction
issue
by
the
circuit
court
was
the
only
thing
that
prevented
this
town
from
going
up
in
flames.
mr.
alexander
g.
jones
yes
sir.
there
have
been
racial
incident
since
that
time
and
an
answer
to
your
question
mr.
justice
marshall,
as
town
attorney
for
this
community,
if
these
people
appear
tomorrow,
i
would
seek
a
similar
injunction
for
exactly
the
same
reasons.
mr.
alexander
g.
jones
yes
sir,
i
would
hope
so.
thank
you
mr.
justice
--
mr.
alexander
g.
jones
no,
sir.
there
was
no
ordinance
in
the
community
and
no
state
law
involved.
mr.
alexander
g.
jones
the
threat
was
that
any
moment,
that
whole
town
and
county
could
blow
up
sir
as
it
had
done
in
the
past.
mr.
alexander
g.
jones
yes,
sir,
but
it
was
been
a
bit
late
to
--
mr.
alexander
g.
jones
against
malicious
distraction,
yes
sir.
mr.
alexander
g.
jones
they
had
not
violated
any
town
ordinance
as
such
mr.
justice.
we
have
no
requirements
as
to
loud
speakers
or
assemblers
or
anything
of
that
nature.
mr.
alexander
g.
jones
at
this
particular
location,
both
of
the
streets
happen
to
be
stayed
highways
at
this
corner
and
the
police,
the
maryland
state
police
were
charged
with
the
provision
of
those
streets.
presumably,
that's
one
reason
they
was
asked.
mr.
alexander
g.
jones
there
are
motor
vehicle
laws
against
the
blocking
of
the
streets,
yes
sir.
and
this
had
happened
in
the
past.
it
happened
in
the
1964
demonstrations.
this
was
when
the
police
were
called
to
clear
the
streets.
mr.
alexander
g.
jones
no
sir.
the
injunction
was
based
upon
the
fact
that
to
these
mixed
audience
in
this
community
at
this
time
and
in
this
place,
a
riot
could
well
have
developed,
that
it
was
imminent.
mr.
alexander
g.
jones
no
your
honor.
mr.
alexander
g.
jones
yes
sir.
the
town
commissioners
and
the
county
commissioners
approached
the
court,
where
they
hastily
draw
on
petition
seeking
an
injunction.
mr.
alexander
g.
jones
no
sir.
simply
they
constitute
a
threat
to
the
general
welfare
and
health,
and
safety
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
town.
mr.
alexander
g.
jones
their
part
--
mr.
alexander
g.
jones
their
physical
present
sir,
in
considerable
numbers
according
to
captain
randall,
it
was
the
only
that
presented
the
riot.
mr.
alexander
g.
jones
the
situation
by
that
time
mr.
justice
could
have
become
so
pulverized
and
so
in
the
flamed
that
there
were
not
enough
state
police
to
the
state
of
maryland
to
have
controlled
it,
and
that
is
colonel
davidson's
testimony
as
well.
mr.
alexander
g.
jones
yes
sir.
the
10
months
injunction
as
mr.
justice
stewart
indicated
coincided
with
the
school
term
of
maryland
state
college.
mr.
alexander
g.
jones
yes
sir.
mr.
alexander
g.
jones
the
second
injunction
as
you
indicate
was
narrower
and
that
it
restrained
them
from
carrying
on
meetings
of
such
a
nature
which
would
intend
to
incite
racial
strike.
mr.
alexander
g.
jones
because
the
--
simply
because
the
situation
was
so
inflammatory
at
the
time
that
almost
any
assembly
of
persons
immediately
set
off
rumors,
counter
rumors,
and
drew
others
to
the
scene.
the
10
months
injunction
in
fact
was
not
requested
by
us,
this
was
entered
by
the
court
on
its
own
initiative.
the
request
for
10
months
was
never
asked
by
us.
mr.
alexander
g.
jones
the
court
possibly
--
mr.
alexander
g.
jones
the
reason
i
haven't
discuss
it
mr.
justice
because
i'm
not
familiar
with
it.
mr.
alexander
g.
jones
no
sir,
we
--
the
brief
here
and
in
the
court
of
appeals
relied
primarily
on
the
original
shank
case
and
the
cases
--
mr.
alexander
g.
jones
shank
sir.
and
the
cases
since
then,
the
sheplenski
and
campwell,
bo
and
harris
and
others.
mr.
alexander
g.
jones
that
would
be
far
enough
in
this
community
sir.
mr.
alexander
g.
jones

mr.
alexander
g.

mr.
alexander
g.
jones
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it

the
court.
the

mr.
alexander
g.
jones
their
physical
present
sir,
in
considerable
numbers
according
to
captain
randall,
it
was
the
only
that
presented
the
riot.
mr.
alexander
g.
jones
the
situation
by
that
time
mr.
justice
could
have
become
so
pulverized
and
so
in
the
flamed
that
there
were
not
enough
state
police
to
the
state
of
maryland
to
have
controlled
it,
and
that
is
colonel
davidson's
testimony
as
well.
mr.
alexander
g.
jones
yes
sir.
the
10
months
injunction
as
mr.
justice
stewart
indicated
coincided
with
the
school
term
of
maryland
state
college.
mr.
alexander
g.
jones
yes
sir.
mr.
alexander
g.
jones
the
second
injunction
as
you
indicate
was
narrower
and
that
it
restrained
them
from
carrying
on
meetings
of
such
a
nature
which
would
intend
to
incite
racial
strike.
mr.
alexander
g.
jones
because
the
--
simply
because
the
situation
was
so
inflammatory
at
the
time
that
almost
any
assembly
of
persons
immediately
set
off
rumors,
counter
rumors,
and
drew
others
to
the
scene.
the
10
months
injunction
in
fact
was
not
requested
by
us,
this
was
entered
by
the
court
on
its
own
initiative.
the
request
for
10
months
was
never
asked
by
us.
mr.
alexander
g.
jones
the
court
possibly
--
mr.
alexander
g.
jones
the
reason
i
haven't
discuss
it
mr.
justice
because
i'm
not
familiar
with
it.
mr.
alexander
g.
jones
no
sir,
we
--
the
brief
here
and
in
the
court
of
appeals
relied
primarily
on
the
original
shank
case
and
the
cases
--
mr.
alexander
g.
jones
shank
sir.
and
the
cases
since
then,
the
sheplenski
and
campwell,
bo
and
harris
and
others.
mr.
alexander
g.
jones
that
would
be
far
enough
in
this
community
sir.
mr.
alexander
g.
jones
that
would
have
been
far
enough
in
this
community.
mr.
alexander
g.
jones
thank
you
sir.
