justice
potter
stewart
are
you
going
to
tell
us
what
did
occur
at
the
august
6
rally?
justice
potter
stewart
you
are?
justice
potter
stewart
all
right.
justice
potter
stewart
why
don't
you
think
the
--
don't
we
have
to
accept
that
the
thought
of
leaving
in
a
box
was
a
reference
at
least
to
violence
and
murder.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
now
there
was
also
evidence
that
wasn't
there.
that
there
had
been
two
rapes
in
the
locality
of
white
women
by
allegedly
by
negro
assailants.
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
recently
that
the
speaker
was
asked
not
to
refer
to,
and
did
not
refer,
but
instead
of
that
he
talked
about
a
1933
incident
which
should
end
about
the
lynching,
the
last
lynching
in
maryland
as
i
understand
it
over
here
in
the
eastern
shore.
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
and
then
he
also
told
them
about
chicago
incident
where
a
white
people
rose
up,
kicked
hell
out
of
the
niggers,
burnt
32
cars.
justice
potter
stewart
was
i
right
in
understanding
that
that
case
had
led
to
the
--
to
a
lynching?
justice
potter
stewart
just
the
opposite,
they
put
stickers
on
that
car
saying
they
were
proud
to
be
of
--
justice
potter
stewart
you're
back
to
the
lynching.
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
think
the
indication
was
that
the
case
could
have
gotten
here
in
time
in
the
walker
against
birmingham
but
rather
that
if
the
petitioners
have
gone
to
the
trial
court
in
alabama
and
had
been
met
with
a
rebuff
or
a
delay,
and
then
had
proceeded
to
hold
their
parade,
the
case
would
have
been
presented
here
ultimately
in
quite
a
different
posture.
justice
potter
stewart
there
were
no
--
there
was
no
ordinances
or
statutes
involved
here,
were
there?
involving--
justice
potter
stewart
--
permits
for
a
meeting
or
anything
like
that?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
right,
there
were
none.
justice
potter
stewart
i
gather
the
10-month
period
was
chosen
by
the
court
because
that
would
cover
the
academic
year
of
maryland
state
college,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
and
i
--
justice
potter
stewart
which
is
the
predominantly
negro
institution?
justice
potter
stewart
time.
but
was
going
to
open
in
september
and
the
academic
year
will
last
until
the
following
june.
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
well
your
language?
no,
i'm
sure
i
misunderstood
you.
you
mean
that
the
court
would
have
held
that
to
be
perfectly
proper?
justice
potter
stewart
you're
not
representing
it
would
have
been
perfectly
proper
would
it?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
i
would,
speaking
only
for
myself,
we
would
suppose
that
you
might
well
argue
that
under
all
conventional,
and
traditional
and
normal
test,
this
case
is
moot.
this
was
a
10-day
injunction
more
than
two
years
ago.
justice
potter
stewart
that
--
i
mean
the
10-days
expired
more
than
two
years
ago
and
nobody
is
now
heard
so
far
as
this
record
shows.
nobody
was
ever
sent
to
prison
or
even
find
or
anything
like
that.
but
what
does
this
to
allow
a
state
to
do?
suppose
tonight,
a
court
enjoins
hubert
humphrey
for
holding
a
meeting
in
a
community
where
he
wants
to
hold
a
meeting
tonight
for
10
days.
and
suppose
he
couldn't
get
that
decided
until
after
november
5th?
justice
potter
stewart
two-day
notice
of
a
hearing
not
a
two-day
hearing
as
i
read
it.
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
have
the
maryland
cases
cited
in
your
brief
with
authorities?
because
that's
not
the
way
i
read
it.
justice
potter
stewart
no
one
would
suggest
--
no
one
would
suggest
that
the
case
is
moot
just
because
there
weren't
any
meetings
involved
at
the
present
time.
justice
potter
stewart
just
before
you
get
to
that,
one
more
question
on
mootness.
was
that
--
was
the
issue
of
mootness
argued
before
the
maryland
court
of
appeals?
justice
potter
stewart
was
still
in
effect,
up
until
the
time
that
was
still
passing?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
the
same
rule
as
on
pages
two
or
three
in
the
footnotes
of
the
reply
brief.
justice
potter

justice
potter
stewart
now,
it's
the
petitioner's
reply
brief.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice

this
was

of
