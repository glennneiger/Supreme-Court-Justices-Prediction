mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
petitioners
are
members
of
the
national
stater
rights
party,
a
political
party
committed
to
white
supremacy
to
which
they
wish
to
win
adherence
to
the
democratic
process.
specifically
the
record
shows
through
running
candidate
in
the
democratic
and
republican
parties
as
well
as
independently.
their
major
way
of
reaching
the
public
is
through
political
street
rallies.
on
august
6,
1966
in
princess
anne,
a
sparsely
populated
town
of
1351
persons,
petitioners
held
a
rally.
the
facts
break
down
roughly
two
ways.
the
circumstances
surrounding
the
issuing
of
the
temporary
injunction,
and
the
circumstances
and
facts
of
the
rally
as
revealed
at
the
hearing
of
august
17th
which
led
to
the
final
injunction
in
this
case.
the
temporary
injunction
was
gotten
because
at
the
end
of
the
rally
of
august
6,
another
rally
for
the
next
evening
was
announced.
though
no
violence
nor
even
any
need
for
police
intervention
to
control
the
crowd
in
any
way
occurred
at
the
august
6th
rally.

and

for

days.

forbids
the
granting
of

a

of
immediate,
substantial,
and
irreparable
injury
to
the

right
to
the
judge
to
communicate
informally
with
the
person
against

whom
the
injunction
is
sought
or
with
his
attorneys.
no
such
measures
were
taken
in
this
case.
such
injunctions
are
indeed
extremely
rare
in
the
state
of
maryland.
the
temporary
order
and
writ
of
injunction
restrained
any
“rallies,
gatherings,
or
meetings
anywhere
in
the
county
that
would
excite
to
riot
or
other
illegal
acts.”
though
the
writ
of
injunction
itself
addressed
to
the
parties
by
name
may
clear
that
the
court
construed
any
gatherings
by
this
party
as
enjoined.
not
simply
those
that
may
excite
to
riot
etcetera,
for
it
enjoined
to
use
of
any
sound
amplification
equipment
in
the
course
of
public
meetings,
such
equipment
being
necessary
to
hold
such
meetings.
a
permanent
injunction
--
the
temporary
order
said
might
issue
upon
hearing.
petitioners
were
not
able
to
find
representation
in
time
for
appear
before
the
return
date
of
august
17.
but
at
that
time,
they
did
--
they
had
secured
counsel
and
they
filed
an
answer
asking
that
the
temporary
injunction
be
rescinded.
now
to
the
facts
and
circumstances
surrounding
the
august
6th
rally,
they
were
given
their
first
hearing
at
the
august
17th
hearing
at
the
court.
it
is
important
to
note
that
there
was
available
to
the
court
at
the
time
of
the
issuing
of
this
ex
parte
injunction
the
tape
from
the
august
6th
rally,
but
the
court
issued
the
injunction
against
further
rallies
without
listening
to
that
tape
at
that
time.
the
tape
recording
reveals
a
description
of
the
parties
aims.
particularly
repeal
of
1965
civil
rights
act
and
other
civil
rights
act
then
under
consideration.
they're
speaking
caustic
terms,
was
a
call
to
actions
but
in
every
case
a
call
explicitly
to
political
action.
examples
of
these
are
rampant
in
the
record.
they
called
for
example
for
those
who
heard
them
to
“organizing
intelligently,
fight
intelligently.”
they
said
for
example,
that
the
national
states
rights
party
advocates
every
legal,
legitimate,
and
political
inaudible
word
in
the
book
to
stop
race
mixing.
as
to
the
specific
political
actions
urged
to
the
whites
they
said,
for
example,
that
they
were
to
phone
and
write
in
button
on
james
bond,
to
the
end
that
the
schools
not
continued
to
be
integrated
in
the
county.
their
only
remark
that
appear
to
be
addressed
specifically
to
the
25%
of
the
crowd
that
was
negro,
urged
them
to
start
taking
reservations
to
africa.
since
this
remark
appears
to
be
among
the
more
controversial
in
the
record,
it
should
be
seen
in
its
entirety
and
context.
the
petitioner
said
in
the
course
of
that
remark,
“we
don't
need
you,
you're
off,
you're
dead.
get
ready
to
leave
this
country.
you
can
leave
in
a
lot
of
way.
you
can
leave
on
a
boat,
you
can
leave
running.
you
can
bicycle
or
you
can
leave
in
a
box.
this
is
a
white
man's
country.
princess
anne
is
a
white
man's
town.
this
is
a
white
man's
country.”
a
witness
testified
that
following
this
exhortation,
both
groups
appeared
interested.
earlier,
the
party
officials
--
ms.
eleanor
holmes
norton
yes
it
was
indeed.
it
was
a
possible
reference
to
their
leaving
in
--
as
a
result
of
some
sort
of
violent
acts.
but
isn't
--
it
is
important
to
note
that
in
advance
of
that
exhortation
of
party
officials
had
noted
and
this
is
earlier.
this
is
before
this
comment
that
the
party's
official
position
about
negroes
was
an
adoption
of
the
position
of
abraham
lincoln
namely
that
this
country
should
send
negroes
back
to
africa.
moreover,
the
remark
in
question
was
not
followed
by
any
exhortations
to
the
crowd
to
either
start
now
or
at
some
future
date
to
seeing
toward
as
negroes
leave
in
a
box
or
even
to
seeing
toward
the
negroes
leave
in
any
other
way.
rather,
immediately
following
this
remark
is
a
classic
call
to
organize
politically
and
nonviolently
to
wit.
let's
organize,
let's
hear
a
great
human
cry
come
up
from
the
people
and
i
guarantee
you
white
folks
out
there
to
win
every
single
political
objective.
and
a
few
sentences
later,
another
of
several
calls
was
specifically
nonviolent,
political
action
to
wit.
bring
your
friends
back
out
here
tomorrow.
we
want
a
shout
to
come
out
of
this
town,
a
nonviolent
shout
that
every
local
politician
is
going
to
hear.
we
want
to
mckelvin
to
hear
it,
governor
talos
to
hear
it,
congressman
morten
and
all
the
lbj's.
ms.
eleanor
holmes
norton
according
to
the
record
mr.
justice,
the
last
as
orders
had
been
in
february
1964.
it
was
then
august
1966.
there
was
specific
testimony
that
relations
between
the
raises
in
the
town
in
advance
of
february
'64
had
been
congenial
and
since
that
it
had
been
congenial.
it
was
on
the
political
prociendo
of
everyone
coming
back
tomorrow
and
raising
a
non-violent
shout
to
political
leaders
that
the
rally
ended
as
the
audience
was
invited
to
come
up
and
take
out
$8.00
memberships
into
the
national
states
rights
party.
the
use
of
the
word
nigger
to
denote
negro
occurred
throughout
the
rally
but
it
provoked
neither
the
negroes
present
nor
the
whites.
in
the
first
place,
no
one
was
specifically
called
a
nigger.
one
of
the
petitioners
gave
as
a
reason
for
the
use
of
the
word
every
time
you
call
a
nigger
appellate
person
you
are
apologizing
to
them
because
they
are
black.
the
--
there
was
clearly
a
political
reason
for
the
uses
of
the
word.
the
county's
evidence
--
ms.
eleanor
holmes
norton
mr.
justice
you
mean
two
rapes
recently?
when
this
rally
was
--
ms.
eleanor
holmes
norton
that
is
correct
and
at
that
time
he
said
to
the
crowd,
“and
i
want
you
to
know
i'm
not
advocating
that
kind
of
action.
i'm
accounting
a
bit
of
history”
ms.
eleanor
holmes
norton
that's
right.
he
recounted
--
he
recounted
incidents
at
which
violence
occurred
but
throughout
the
record,
we
have
these
petitioners
telling
the
crowd,
“look,
don't
involve
yourself
in
violence.
that
happened
to
us
before.
that's
what
they
want
to
have
happen
here
and
we
distort
you
against
it.”
the
county
put
on
evidence
that
rally,
at
the
rally
were
200
people.
that
there
was
an
ample
police
force
that
the
negroes
were
clearly
disturbed
and
angry
but
that
they
did
not
so
much
as
even
mingle
with
the
whites.
there
was
evidence
over
the
objection
of
counsel
of
1964
riots
that
had
followed
sit-ins,
not
pure
speech.
there
was
evidence
that
there
was
racial
peace
before
and
since.
there
was
also
evidence
of
cooperation
between
petitioners
and
the
authorities.
one
of
petitioners
for
example,
inquired
about
the
use
of
a
public
address
system
and
about
general
sponsorship
of
a
rally.
captain
randall,
one
of
the
officers
present,
did
request
that
that
there
will
be
no
mention
of
the
cases
and
as
the
justices
point
it
out,
there
was
no
mention
although
there
was
mentioned
of
the
1933
case.
ms.
eleanor
holmes
norton
that
case
had
indeed
led
to
a
lynching
and
these
petitioners
noted
that
at
that
time,
there
was
shame
cast
on
princess
anne
but
that
they
didn't
feel
that
--
but
princess
anne
apparently
at
that
time
didn't
feel
that
was
such
a
shameful
conduct.
ms.
eleanor
holmes
norton
currently
they
were
proud
--
ms.
eleanor
holmes
norton
that's
right.
these
petitioners
did
relate
to
this
audience
by
encouraging
them
that
they
had
participated
in
activity
that
might
be
also
considered
to
be
raises
although
these
petitioners
did
not
in
fact
exert
them
to
participate
in
such
activity
at
the
present
time.
the
court
refused
to
hang
down
on
immediate
opinion
or
even
a
ruling
because
they
want
to
see
a
transcript
first.
23
days
later,
a
permanent
10-month
injunction
issued
effectively
continuing
and
enforced
a
temporary
injunction.
since
then,
a
sound
equipment
statute
arguably
bad
under
seija
versus
new
york
has
been
passed
by
the
county.
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland
disapproved
neither
injunction.
however,
it
held
at
the
10-month
injunction
was
too
long.
of
the
10-day
ex
parte
temporary
injunction,
the
court
of
appeals
said,
“the
court
was
correct
in
issuing
its
order
dated
august
7,
1966.”
if
the
justices
please,
i'd
like
to
deal
with
the
mootness
questions
first.
this
court
has
currently
given
some
time
to
trial
counsel,
co-counsel
here
mr.
zinman
in
order
that
he
might
relate
some
of
the
factual
circumstances
that
might
clear
up
this
issue
somewhat
more.
he'll
take
five
minutes
to
do
that
when
i
had
finished.
we
believe
that
this
case
is
not
moot
because
we
believe
we
come
within
two
exceptions.
one,
a
substantive
exception
and
the
other
are
procedural
exception.
and
this
court
has
always
recognized
exceptions
to
the
mootness
requirements.
we
cite
a
law
review
article
by
diamond
and
generally
in
our
brief.
and
in
that
--
in
the
course
of
that
article,
there
is
a
summary
of
one
of
the
exceptions
to
mootness
which
we
feel
we
fall
within.
it
bans
perhaps
quoting
here
this
short,
“although
the
controlling
fact
situation
may
be
so
changed
that
the
specific
relief
sort
is
no
longer
possible.”
if
the
situation
is
self
perpetuating,
the
parties
are
entitled
to
an
adjudication
which
will
apply
to
the
renewed
phase
of
the
controversy
and
existence.
we
believe
that
this
controversy
is
clearly
self
perpetuating.
these
petitioners
have
been
informed
that
they
will
not
be
able
to
speak
in
princess
anne
county
maryland
unless
they
sense
of
their
remarks.
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
the
south
pacific
case
where
--
southern
pacific
case
excuse
me,
where
this
court
said
that
short
term
order
is
capable
of
repetition
will
not
defeat
a
claim
for
mootness.
we've
cited
two
other
cases
in
our
brief
which
we
think
point
out
the
difference
between
moot
claims
and
none
moot
claims.
one
is
oil
workers
where
the
court
found
mootness
to
exist.
the
other
is
motor
coach
where
the
court
found
no
mootness
to
exist.
in
both
cases,
the
governor's
seizure
of
a
public
utility
was
at
issue
and
the
governor
had
returned
the
property.
the
difference
was
that
the
underlying
factual
dispute
was
present
in
one
case
in
motor
coach
and
not
present
in
the
other.
that
underlying
factual
dispute
was
a
strike
which
ended
in
the
one
case
and
which
continued
in
the
other.
we
think
that
the
sideburn
case
decided
last
term
by
this
court
also
points
out
a
kind
of
exception
this
court
will
--
it
takes
normal
mootness
claims.
there,
it
was
pointed
out
that
failures
in
state
procedure
will
not
be
allowed
as
a
course
for
mootness.
now,
we
think
that
there
are
specific
failures
of
state
procedure
here
which
this
court
in
freidman
versus
maryland
has
already
analyzed
and
condemned.
there
this
court,
looking
at
the
censorship
statute
noted
that
there
was
no
prompt
way
to
get
judicial
review
in
the
state
of
maryland.
it
compared
maryland
procedure
with
new
york
procedure.
under
new
york
procedure,
under
maryland
procedure,
it
found
that
the
statute
talked
about
prompt
administrative
determination
but
it
said
that
there
was
no
assurance
of
prompt
judicial
review
and
this
court
didn't
really
know
how
prompt
administrative
determination
had
to
be.
in
new
york
on
the
other
hand,
there
is
clear,
definite
language
by
the
time
limits
as
this
court
said.
for
example,
a
judge
had
to
in
new
york
hand
down
his
opinion
within
two
days
after
a
matter
was
heard.
that
kind
of
time
limit
saved
the
censorship
statute
in
new
york
and
didn't
save
censorship
in
maryland
and
we
submit
that
in
this
case,
we
have
that
kind
situation.
moreover,
walker
versus
birmingham
is
procedurally
relevant
here,
because
the
court
there
criticized
petitioners
for
making
no
efforts
to
challenge
the
injunction
there.
and
the
court
gave
every
indication
that
if
petitioners
had
made
efforts
and
if
petitioners
had
met
with
delay,
this
court
would
have
decided
the
case.
yet
i
believe
that
that
case
could
not
have
gotten
to
this
court
either
before
it
became
moot.
for
the
demonstration,
it
was
hoped
to
be
held
on
an
easter
sunday
and
the
injunction
was
issued
some
two
or
three
days
before
hand
and
even
under
available
procedure.
they
could
not
have
gotten
here
so
i
think
there's
an
indication
in
the
opinion
that
this
court
would
have
decided
that
ex
parte
temporary
injunction
case
because
it
related
to
free
speech.
the
court
--
this
--
ms.
eleanor
holmes
norton
that's
possible
your
honor
but
another
procedure
would
have
been
just
as
much
open
to
them
would
have
been
to
somehow
seek
appeal
here
and
they
would
have
been
uncertain
as
to
whether
or
not
to
violate
the
injunction
then
or
not.
it
certainly
is
worth
noting
that
this
court
in
walker
and
birmingham
expressed
considerable
doubt
as
to
the
injunction
and
statute
involved
even
though
it
didn't
have
to
decide
that
question
because
it
was
a
first
amendment
case
and
it
had
an
ex
parte
injunction
in
it.
we
believe
that
these
procedural
and
substantive
reasons
which
are
applicable
to
cases
generally
apply
here,
but
we
believe
this
case
has
another
important
part
to
and
that
is
that
now
it's
an
ex
parte
injunction
here
in
a
first
amendment
case.
and
we
believe
that
the
supremacy
clause
means
that
this
court
ought
not
let
that
ex
parte
injunction
stand
as
law
and
rule
of
the
first
amendment.
indeed,
even
when
speech
is
not
involved,
equity
will
normally
not
enjoin
the
commission
of
a
criminal
act.
but
when
speeches
involved,
it
would
seem
all
the
more
inappropriate.
the
court
below
it
should
be
noted
expressly
approved
the
ex
parte
injunction
here
though
it
had
run
by
the
time
it
got
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
we
think
this
court
can
do
the
same.
we
like
to
spend
the
few
minutes
on
the
injunction
themselves.
ms.
eleanor
holmes
norton
yes.
yes,
they
did
although
not
before
the
answer
day.
we've
submitted
a
reply
brief
in
which
we
have
shown
at
the
petitioners
could
not
secure
counsel
in
time
to
force
a
hearing
before
they
did.
had
they
been
able
to
do
so?
they
would
have
done
so
and
as
soon
as
they
secured
counsel,
they
did
in
fact
file
an
answer.
we've
asked
this
court
to
do
two
things
with
respect
to
these
injunctions.
number
one,
to
disapprove
the
use
of
the
injunctive
process
to
control
speech
and
number
two,
we've
argued
that
these
injunctions
in
any
case
were
improper
because
the
evidence
is
finally
submitted,
did
not
show
that
an
uncontrollable
situation
was
bound
to
result
from
the
next
rally.
the
disapproval
of
the
injunctive
process
we
think
is
necessary
and
would
only
repeat
what
this
court
has
done
in
the
permit
cases.
we
don't
need
to
tell
this
court
that
a
prior
restraint
is
the
essence
of
what
the
first
amendment
bars
so
much
so
that
this
court
has
rarely
had
before
it
and
a
speech
that
has
been
enjoined.
ms.
eleanor
holmes
norton
that's
right.
ms.
eleanor
holmes
norton
that's
right
your
honor.
there
was
nothing
in
existence
--
ms.
eleanor
holmes
norton
that's
right
at
that
time.
this
court
in
permit
cases
has
always
looked
to
see
whether
or
not
the
permit
went
beyond
mere
ministerial
permission
--
ordering
the
mere
ministerial
permission
be
given
to
give
speeches.
what
we
think
that
means
is
that
this
court
has
said
in
speech
cases,
there
shall
be
no
prior
restraint.
all
we're
asking
this
court
to
do
is
do
the
same
thing
in
the
context
of
an
ex
parte
injunction.
we
think
there's
another
reason
why
this
court
should
disapprove
the
use
of
the
ex
parte
injunction
because
we
believe
this
court
has
said
and
whenever
it
is
used
in
any
free
speech
test,
that
the
state
must
use
a
constitutional
way
to
reach
its
legitimate
end.
now
we
certainly
regard
the
end
here
as
legitimate.
here
the
end
is
control
of
disorder,
but
disorder
can
be
controlled
without
the
menacing,
without
the
broad,
without
the
unusual
ex
parte
temporary
injunction.
this
is
--
this
has
been
said
in
this
court
time
and
memorial
and
can't
--
ms.
eleanor
holmes
norton
that's
right
your
honor.
ms.
eleanor
holmes
norton
no,
the
second
order
was
not
ex
parte.
the
second
order
--
ms.
eleanor
holmes
norton
yes,
that's
local
terminology.
ms.
eleanor
holmes
norton
that's
right.
ms.
eleanor
holmes
norton
that's
right
sir.
ms.
eleanor
holmes
norton
no
it
did
not.
it
expressly
indicated
that
the
ex
parte
order
had
been
valid.
ms.
eleanor
holmes
norton
the
10-month
order
it
said
was
invalid
only
because
it
was
for
too
long
a
period
of
time.
ms.
eleanor
holmes
norton
technically,
that's
true
your
honor.
ms.
eleanor
holmes
norton
not
only
a
particular
proposed
meeting
but
any
meeting
that
might
have
been
held
for
those
10
days
your
honor.
ms.
eleanor
holmes
norton
yes.
ms.
eleanor
holmes
norton
technically
we
do
not,
because
technically
it
was
struck
down
although
the
method,
that
the
injunction
method
was
expressly
approved.
ms.
eleanor
holmes
norton
that's
right
your
honor.
ms.
eleanor
holmes
norton
oh,
well,
we
believe
that
that
subsequent
application
demonstrates
that
the
effect
of
the
ex
parte
injunction
continues
although
the
10
days
--
ms.
eleanor
holmes
norton
that's
right.
the
one
that
was
granted
was
granted
only
if
petitioners
agreed
not
to
give
a
speech
of
the
kind
they
gave
on
august
6.
ms.
eleanor
holmes
norton
it
has
not
been
litigated
below.
ms.
eleanor
holmes
norton
it's
not
before
as
in
the
record
as
a
cause
of
action.
it's
only
they
have
to
demonstrate.
ms.
eleanor
holmes
norton
it
is
--
we
brought
to
this
court's
attention
--
ms.
eleanor
holmes
norton
only
to
show
in
the
form
of
letters
in
the
appendix
of
our
petition
for
certiorari.
ms.
eleanor
holmes
norton
in
the
reply
brief,
there
is
a
statute
since
passed
pointed
which
requires
a
permit
in
order
to
use
sound
equipment.
ms.
eleanor
holmes
norton
we
have
the
letter
in
which
the
permit
is
granted.
ms.
eleanor
holmes
norton
only
if
x-y-z
is
done.
ms.
eleanor
holmes
norton
that's
right.
that
was
indeed
the
form,
yes
sir.
ms.
eleanor
holmes
norton
yes.
ms.
eleanor
holmes
norton
all
right,
i
will
give
him
five
minutes
and
thank
you
your
honor
for
calling
that
to
my
attention.
ms.
eleanor
holmes
norton
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
petitioners
are
members
of
the
national
stater
rights
party,
a
political
party
committed
to
white
supremacy
to
which
they
wish
to
win
adherence
to
the
democratic
process.
specifically
the
record
shows
through
running
candidate
in
the
democratic
and
republican
parties
as
well
as
independently.
their
major
way
of
reaching
the
public
is
through
political
street
rallies.
on
august
6,
1966
in
princess
anne,
a
sparsely
populated
town
of
1351
persons,
petitioners
held
a
rally.
the
facts
break
down
roughly
two
ways.
the
circumstances
surrounding
the
issuing
of
the
temporary
injunction,
and
the
circumstances
and
facts
of
the
rally
as
revealed
at
the
hearing
of
august
17th
which
led
to
the
final
injunction
in
this
case.
the
temporary
injunction
was
gotten
because
at
the
end
of
the
rally
of
august
6,
another
rally
for
the
next
evening
was
announced.
though
no
violence
nor
even
any
need
for
police
intervention
to
control
the
crowd
in
any
way
occurred
at
the
august
6th
rally.

and
county
officials

ex

injunction
for
10
days.

ms.

rule
bb72
forbids
the
granting
of
such
an
injunction
without
a
showing
of
immediate,
substantial,
and
irreparable
injury
to
the
applicant
before
an
adversary

can
be
held,
and
expressly
grants
the
right
to
the
judge
to
communicate
informally
with
the
person
against
to
whom
the
injunction
is
sought
or
with
his
attorneys.
no
such
measures
were
taken
in
this
case.
such
injunctions
are
indeed
extremely
rare
in
the
state
of
maryland.
the
temporary
order
and
writ
of
injunction
restrained
any
“rallies,
gatherings,
or
meetings
anywhere
in
the
county
that
would
excite
to
riot
or
other
illegal
acts.”
though
the
writ
of
injunction
itself
addressed
to
the
parties
by
name
may
clear
that
the
court
construed
any
gatherings
by
this
party
as
enjoined.
not
simply
those
that
may
excite
to
riot
etcetera,
for
it
enjoined
to
use
of
any
sound
amplification
equipment
in
the
course
of
public
meetings,
such
equipment
being
necessary
to
hold
such
meetings.
a
permanent
injunction
--
the
temporary
order
said
might
issue
upon
hearing.
petitioners
were
not
able
to
find
representation
in
time
for
appear
before
the
return
date
of
august
17.
but
at
that
time,
they
did
--
they
had
secured
counsel
and
they
filed
an
answer
asking
that
the
temporary
injunction
be
rescinded.
now
to
the
facts
and
circumstances
surrounding
the
august
6th
rally,
they
were
given
their
first
hearing
at
the
august
17th
hearing
at
the
court.
it
is
important
to
note
that
there
was
available
to
the
court
at
the
time
of
the
issuing
of
this
ex
parte
injunction
the
tape
from
the
august
6th
rally,
but
the
court
issued
the
injunction
against
further
rallies
without
listening
to
that
tape
at
that
time.
the
tape
recording
reveals
a
description
of
the
parties
aims.
particularly
repeal
of
1965
civil
rights
act
and
other
civil
rights
act
then
under
consideration.
they're
speaking
caustic
terms,
was
a
call
to
actions
but
in
every
case
a
call
explicitly
to
political
action.
examples
of
these
are
rampant
in
the
record.
they
called
for
example
for
those
who
heard
them
to
“organizing
intelligently,
fight
intelligently.”
they
said
for
example,
that
the
national
states
rights
party
advocates
every
legal,
legitimate,
and
political
inaudible
word
in
the
book
to
stop
race
mixing.
as
to
the
specific
political
actions
urged
to
the
whites
they
said,
for
example,
that
they
were
to
phone
and
write
in
button
on
james
bond,
to
the
end
that
the
schools
not
continued
to
be
integrated
in
the
county.
their
only
remark
that
appear
to
be
addressed
specifically
to
the
25%
of
the
crowd
that
was
negro,
urged
them
to
start
taking
reservations
to
africa.
since
this
remark
appears
to
be
among
the
more
controversial
in
the
record,
it
should
be
seen
in
its
entirety
and
context.
the
petitioner
said
in
the
course
of
that
remark,
“we
don't
need
you,
you're
off,
you're
dead.
get
ready
to
leave
this
country.
you
can
leave
in
a
lot
of
way.
you
can
leave
on
a
boat,
you
can
leave
running.
you
can
bicycle
or
you
can
leave
in
a
box.
this
is
a
white
man's
country.
princess
anne
is
a
white
man's
town.
this
is
a
white
man's
country.”
a
witness
testified
that
following
this
exhortation,
both
groups
appeared
interested.
earlier,
the
party
officials
--
ms.
eleanor
holmes
norton
yes
it
was
indeed.
it
was
a
possible
reference
to
their
leaving
in
--
as
a
result
of
some
sort
of
violent
acts.
but
isn't
--
it
is
important
to
note
that
in
advance
of
that
exhortation
of
party
officials
had
noted
and
this
is
earlier.
this
is
before
this
comment
that
the
party's
official
position
about
negroes
was
an
adoption
of
the
position
of
abraham
lincoln
namely
that
this
country
should
send
negroes
back
to
africa.
moreover,
the
remark
in
question
was
not
followed
by
any
exhortations
to
the
crowd
to
either
start
now
or
at
some
future
date
to
seeing
toward
as
negroes
leave
in
a
box
or
even
to
seeing
toward
the
negroes
leave
in
any
other
way.
rather,
immediately
following
this
remark
is
a
classic
call
to
organize
politically
and
nonviolently
to
wit.
let's
organize,
let's
hear
a
great
human
cry
come
up
from
the
people
and
i
guarantee
you
white
folks
out
there
to
win
every
single
political
objective.
and
a
few
sentences
later,
another
of
several
calls
was
specifically
nonviolent,
political
action
to
wit.
bring
your
friends
back
out
here
tomorrow.
we
want
a
shout
to
come
out
of
this
town,
a
nonviolent
shout
that
every
local
politician
is
going
to
hear.
we
want
to
mckelvin
to
hear
it,
governor
talos
to
hear
it,
congressman
morten
and
all
the
lbj's.
ms.
eleanor
holmes
norton
according
to
the
record
mr.
justice,
the
last
as
orders
had
been
in
february
1964.
it
was
then
august
1966.
there
was
specific
testimony
that
relations
between
the
raises
in
the
town
in
advance
of
february
'64
had
been
congenial
and
since
that
it
had
been
congenial.
it
was
on
the
political
prociendo
of
everyone
coming
back
tomorrow
and
raising
a
non-violent
shout
to
political
leaders
that
the
rally
ended
as
the
audience
was
invited
to
come
up
and
take
out
$8.00
memberships
into
the
national
states
rights
party.
the
use
of
the
word
nigger
to
denote
negro
occurred
throughout
the
rally
but
it
provoked
neither
the
negroes
present
nor
the
whites.
in
the
first
place,
no
one
was
specifically
called
a
nigger.
one
of
the
petitioners
gave
as
a
reason
for
the
use
of
the
word
every
time
you
call
a
nigger
appellate
person
you
are
apologizing
to
them
because
they
are
black.
the
--
there
was
clearly
a
political
reason
for
the
uses
of
the
word.
the
county's
evidence
--
ms.
eleanor
holmes
norton
mr.
justice
you
mean
two
rapes
recently?
when
this
rally
was
--
ms.
eleanor
holmes
norton
that
is
correct
and
at
that
time
he
said
to
the
crowd,
“and
i
want
you
to
know
i'm
not
advocating
that
kind
of
action.
i'm
accounting
a
bit
of
history”
ms.
eleanor
holmes
norton
that's
right.
he
recounted
--
he
recounted
incidents
at
which
violence
occurred
but
throughout
the
record,
we
have
these
petitioners
telling
the
crowd,
“look,
don't
involve
yourself
in
violence.
that
happened
to
us
before.
that's
what
they
want
to
have
happen
here
and
we
distort
you
against
it.”
the
county
put
on
evidence
that
rally,
at
the
rally
were
200
people.
that
there
was
an
ample
police
force
that
the
negroes
were
clearly
disturbed
and
angry
but
that
they
did
not
so
much
as
even
mingle
with
the
whites.
there
was
evidence
over
the
objection
of
counsel
of
1964
riots
that
had
followed
sit-ins,
not
pure
speech.
there
was
evidence
that
there
was
racial
peace
before
and
since.
there
was
also
evidence
of
cooperation
between
petitioners
and
the
authorities.
one
of
petitioners
for
example,
inquired
about
the
use
of
a
public
address
system
and
about
general
sponsorship
of
a
rally.
captain
randall,
one
of
the
officers
present,
did
request
that
that
there
will
be
no
mention
of
the
cases
and
as
the
justices
point
it
out,
there
was
no
mention
although
there
was
mentioned
of
the
1933
case.
ms.
eleanor
holmes
norton
that
case
had
indeed
led
to
a
lynching
and
these
petitioners
noted
that
at
that
time,
there
was
shame
cast
on
princess
anne
but
that
they
didn't
feel
that
--
but
princess
anne
apparently
at
that
time
didn't
feel
that
was
such
a
shameful
conduct.
ms.
eleanor
holmes
norton
currently
they
were
proud
--
ms.
eleanor
holmes
norton
that's
right.
these
petitioners
did
relate
to
this
audience
by
encouraging
them
that
they
had
participated
in
activity
that
might
be
also
considered
to
be
raises
although
these
petitioners
did
not
in
fact
exert
them
to
participate
in
such
activity
at
the
present
time.
the
court
refused
to
hang
down
on
immediate
opinion
or
even
a
ruling
because
they
want
to
see
a
transcript
first.
23
days
later,
a
permanent
10-month
injunction
issued
effectively
continuing
and
enforced
a
temporary
injunction.
since
then,
a
sound
equipment
statute
arguably
bad
under
seija
versus
new
york
has
been
passed
by
the
county.
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland
disapproved
neither
injunction.
however,
it
held
at
the
10-month
injunction
was
too
long.
of
the
10-day
ex
parte
temporary
injunction,
the
court
of
appeals
said,
“the
court
was
correct
in
issuing
its
order
dated
august
7,
1966.”
if
the
justices
please,
i'd
like
to
deal
with
the
mootness
questions
first.
this
court
has
currently
given
some
time
to
trial
counsel,
co-counsel
here
mr.
zinman
in
order
that
he
might
relate
some
of
the
factual
circumstances
that
might
clear
up
this
issue
somewhat
more.
he'll
take
five
minutes
to
do
that
when
i
had
finished.
we
believe
that
this
case
is
not
moot
because
we
believe
we
come
within
two
exceptions.
one,
a
substantive
exception
and
the
other
are
procedural
exception.
and
this
court
has
always
recognized
exceptions
to
the
mootness
requirements.
we
cite
a
law
review
article
by
diamond
and
generally
in
our
brief.
and
in
that
--
in
the
course
of
that
article,
there
is
a
summary
of
one
of
the
exceptions
to
mootness
which
we
feel
we
fall
within.
it
bans
perhaps
quoting
here
this
short,
“although
the
controlling
fact
situation
may
be
so
changed
that
the
specific
relief
sort
is
no
longer
possible.”
if
the
situation
is
self
perpetuating,
the
parties
are
entitled
to
an
adjudication
which
will
apply
to
the
renewed
phase
of
the
controversy
and
existence.
we
believe
that
this
controversy
is
clearly
self
perpetuating.
these
petitioners
have
been
informed
that
they
will
not
be
able
to
speak
in
princess
anne
county
maryland
unless
they
sense
of
their
remarks.
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
the
south
pacific
case
where
--
southern
pacific
case
excuse
me,
where
this
court
said
that
short
term
order
is
capable
of
repetition
will
not
defeat
a
claim
for
mootness.
we've
cited
two
other
cases
in
our
brief
which
we
think
point
out
the
difference
between
moot
claims
and
none
moot
claims.
one
is
oil
workers
where
the
court
found
mootness
to
exist.
the
other
is
motor
coach
where
the
court
found
no
mootness
to
exist.
in
both
cases,
the
governor's
seizure
of
a
public
utility
was
at
issue
and
the
governor
had
returned
the
property.
the
difference
was
that
the
underlying
factual
dispute
was
present
in
one
case
in
motor
coach
and
not
present
in
the
other.
that
underlying
factual
dispute
was
a
strike
which
ended
in
the
one
case
and
which
continued
in
the
other.
we
think
that
the
sideburn
case
decided
last
term
by
this
court
also
points
out
a
kind
of
exception
this
court
will
--
it
takes
normal
mootness
claims.
there,
it
was
pointed
out
that
failures
in
state
procedure
will
not
be
allowed
as
a
course
for
mootness.
now,
we
think
that
there
are
specific
failures
of
state
procedure
here
which
this
court
in
freidman
versus
maryland
has
already
analyzed
and
condemned.
there
this
court,
looking
at
the
censorship
statute
noted
that
there
was
no
prompt
way
to
get
judicial
review
in
the
state
of
maryland.
it
compared
maryland
procedure
with
new
york
procedure.
under
new
york
procedure,
under
maryland
procedure,
it
found
that
the
statute
talked
about
prompt
administrative
determination
but
it
said
that
there
was
no
assurance
of
prompt
judicial
review
and
this
court
didn't
really
know
how
prompt
administrative
determination
had
to
be.
in
new
york
on
the
other
hand,
there
is
clear,
definite
language
by
the
time
limits
as
this
court
said.
for
example,
a
judge
had
to
in
new
york
hand
down
his
opinion
within
two
days
after
a
matter
was
heard.
that
kind
of
time
limit
saved
the
censorship
statute
in
new
york
and
didn't
save
censorship
in
maryland
and
we
submit
that
in
this
case,
we
have
that
kind
situation.
moreover,
walker
versus
birmingham
is
procedurally
relevant
here,
because
the
court
there
criticized
petitioners
for
making
no
efforts
to
challenge
the
injunction
there.
and
the
court
gave
every
indication
that
if
petitioners
had
made
efforts
and
if
petitioners
had
met
with
delay,
this
court
would
have
decided
the
case.
yet
i
believe
that
that
case
could
not
have
gotten
to
this
court
either
before
it
became
moot.
for
the
demonstration,
it
was
hoped
to
be
held
on
an
easter
sunday
and
the
injunction
was
issued
some
two
or
three
days
before
hand
and
even
under
available
procedure.
they
could
not
have
gotten
here
so
i
think
there's
an
indication
in
the
opinion
that
this
court
would
have
decided
that
ex
parte
temporary
injunction
case
because
it
related
to
free
speech.
the
court
--
this
--
ms.
eleanor
holmes
norton
that's
possible
your
honor
but
another
procedure
would
have
been
just
as
much
open
to
them
would
have
been
to
somehow
seek
appeal
here
and
they
would
have
been
uncertain
as
to
whether
or
not
to
violate
the
injunction
then
or
not.
it
certainly
is
worth
noting
that
this
court
in
walker
and
birmingham
expressed
considerable
doubt
as
to
the
injunction
and
statute
involved
even
though
it
didn't
have
to
decide
that
question
because
it
was
a
first
amendment
case
and
it
had
an
ex
parte
injunction
in
it.
we
believe
that
these
procedural
and
substantive
reasons
which
are
applicable
to
cases
generally
apply
here,
but
we
believe
this
case
has
another
important
part
to
and
that
is
that
now
it's
an
ex
parte
injunction
here
in
a
first
amendment
case.
and
we
believe
that
the
supremacy
clause
means
that
this
court
ought
not
let
that
ex
parte
injunction
stand
as
law
and
rule
of
the
first
amendment.
indeed,
even
when
speech
is
not
involved,
equity
will
normally
not
enjoin
the
commission
of
a
criminal
act.
but
when
speeches
involved,
it
would
seem
all
the
more
inappropriate.
the
court
below
it
should
be
noted
expressly
approved
the
ex
parte
injunction
here
though
it
had
run
by
the
time
it
got
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
we
think
this
court
can
do
the
same.
we
like
to
spend
the
few
minutes
on
the
injunction
themselves.
ms.
eleanor
holmes
norton
yes.
yes,
they
did
although
not
before
the
answer
day.
we've
submitted
a
reply
brief
in
which
we
have
shown
at
the
petitioners
could
not
secure
counsel
in
time
to
force
a
hearing
before
they
did.
had
they
been
able
to
do
so?
they
would
have
done
so
and
as
soon
as
they
secured
counsel,
they
did
in
fact
file
an
answer.
we've
asked
this
court
to
do
two
things
with
respect
to
these
injunctions.
number
one,
to
disapprove
the
use
of
the
injunctive
process
to
control
speech
and
number
two,
we've
argued
that
these
injunctions
in
any
case
were
improper
because
the
evidence
is
finally
submitted,
did
not
show
that
an
uncontrollable
situation
was
bound
to
result
from
the
next
rally.
the
disapproval
of
the
injunctive
process
we
think
is
necessary
and
would
only
repeat
what
this
court
has
done
in
the
permit
cases.
we
don't
need
to
tell
this
court
that
a
prior
restraint
is
the
essence
of
what
the
first
amendment
bars
so
much
so
that
this
court
has
rarely
had
before
it
and
a
speech
that
has
been
enjoined.
ms.
eleanor
holmes
norton
that's
right.
ms.
eleanor
holmes
norton
that's
right
your
honor.
there
was
nothing
in
existence
--
ms.
eleanor
holmes
norton
that's
right
at
that
time.
this
court
in
permit
cases
has
always
looked
to
see
whether
or
not
the
permit
went
beyond
mere
ministerial
permission
--
ordering
the
mere
ministerial
permission
be
given
to
give
speeches.
what
we
think
that
means
is
that
this
court
has
said
in
speech
cases,
there
shall
be
no
prior
restraint.
all
we're
asking
this
court
to
do
is
do
the
same
thing
in
the
context
of
an
ex
parte
injunction.
we
think
there's
another
reason
why
this
court
should
disapprove
the
use
of
the
ex
parte
injunction
because
we
believe
this
court
has
said
and
whenever
it
is
used
in
any
free
speech
test,
that
the
state
must
use
a
constitutional
way
to
reach
its
legitimate
end.
now
we
certainly
regard
the
end
here
as
legitimate.
here
the
end
is
control
of
disorder,
but
disorder
can
be
controlled
without
the
menacing,
without
the
broad,
without
the
unusual
ex
parte
temporary
injunction.
this
is
--
this
has
been
said
in
this
court
time
and
memorial
and
can't
--
ms.
eleanor
holmes
norton
that's
right
your
honor.
ms.
eleanor
holmes
norton
no,
the
second
order
was
not
ex
parte.
the
second
order
--
ms.
eleanor
holmes
norton
yes,
that's
local
terminology.
ms.
eleanor
holmes
norton
that's
right.
ms.
eleanor
holmes
norton
that's
right
sir.
ms.
eleanor
holmes
norton
no
it
did
not.
it
expressly
indicated
that
the
ex
parte
order
had
been
valid.
ms.
eleanor
holmes
norton
the
10-month
order
it
said
was
invalid
only
because
it
was
for
too
long
a
period
of
time.
ms.
eleanor
holmes
norton
technically,
that's
true
your
honor.
ms.
eleanor
holmes
norton
not
only
a
particular
proposed
meeting
but
any
meeting
that
might
have
been
held
for
those
10
days
your
honor.
ms.
eleanor
holmes
norton
yes.
ms.
eleanor
holmes
norton
technically
we
do
not,
because
technically
it
was
struck
down
although
the
method,
that
the
injunction
method
was
expressly
approved.
ms.
eleanor
holmes
norton
that's
right
your
honor.
ms.
eleanor
holmes
norton
oh,
well,
we
believe
that
that
subsequent
application
demonstrates
that
the
effect
of
the
ex
parte
injunction
continues
although
the
10
days
--
ms.
eleanor
holmes
norton
that's
right.
the
one
that
was
granted
was
granted
only
if
petitioners
agreed
not
to
give
a
speech
of
the
kind
they
gave
on
august
6.
ms.
eleanor
holmes
norton
it
has
not
been
litigated
below.
ms.
eleanor
holmes
norton
it's
not
before
as
in
the
record
as
a
cause
of
action.
it's
only
they
have
to
demonstrate.
ms.
eleanor
holmes
norton
it
is
--
we
brought
to
this
court's
attention
--
ms.
eleanor
holmes
norton
only
to
show
in
the
form
of
letters
in
the
appendix
of
our
petition
for
certiorari.
ms.
eleanor
holmes
norton
in
the
reply
brief,
there
is
a
statute
since
passed
pointed
which
requires
a
permit
in
order
to
use
sound
equipment.
ms.
eleanor
holmes
norton
we
have
the
letter
in
which
the
permit
is
granted.
ms.
eleanor
holmes
norton
only
if
x-y-z
is
done.
ms.
eleanor
holmes
norton
that's
right.
that
was
indeed
the
form,
yes
sir.
ms.
eleanor
holmes
norton
yes.
ms.
eleanor
holmes
norton
all
right,
i
will
give
him
five
minutes
and
thank
you
your
honor
for
calling
that
to
my
attention.
