justice
byron
r.
white
but
maryland
contend
here
that
the
temporary
ex
parte
injunction
was
validly
issued?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
at
least
the
--
your
highest
court
said
that
it
was
a
proper
injunction?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
this
is
(voice
overlap)
--
this
is
the
rule
--
is
this
a
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
this
is
an
interpretation
by
the
maryland
courts,
by
the
highest
court
of
maryland
as
to
what
kind
of
conduct
that
a
meeting
would
justify
an
injunction,
as
a
threat
to
the
public
order.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
now
that
is
--
so
there
is
an
interpretation
of
the
first
amendment
or
of
the
maryland
law
has
been
permissible
under
the
first
amendment
which
have
now
obtains
in
maryland
and
which
people
who
want
to
hold
meetings
must
observe,
unless
they
want
to
be
subject
to
an
injunction.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
that's
a
--
that's
another
--
we're
still
talking
on
mootness.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
rule
is
one
that
obtains
in
maryland
now
and
that
this
group,
which
was
enjoined
is
subject
to
like
all
the
other
groups.
justice
byron
r.
white
now
why
would
you
suggest
it
that
that
this
case
then
is
moot
vis-à-vis
this
particular
group
who
is,
you
don't
suggest
as
out
of
business,
who
doesn't
want
to
have
anymore
meetings.
but
it
must
have,
it
must
now
in
maryland
observe
this
rule.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
the
ruling
that,
the
ruling
that
the
--
under
the
maryland
law
pleadings
that
they
be
stopped
by
the
injunction
consistently
with
the
first
amendment
is
an
ongoing
--
that
takes
the
rule
of
bowen
out.
it's
the
way
that
the
first
amendment
and
the
maryland
law
has
been
and
will
be
interpreted.
isn't
that
any
different
i
don't
suppose,
if
it's
a
--
and
if
there
were
a
statute
in
maryland
that
says,
“under
certain
circumstances
meetings
may
be
enjoined,
and
the
people
who
want
to
hold
meetings,
bring
declaratory
judgement
action
that
challenging
that
statute.”
and
the
statute
is
upheld.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you're
--
now
you're
just
arguing
that
for
the
correctness
of
the
rule.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that
isn't
mootness.
i
mean,
we
may
perfectly
agree
with
the
maryland
court.
who
knows?
but
that
doesn't
mean
the
issue
is
moot.
justice
byron
r.
white
maybe
--
maybe
the
ruling
is
correct,
but
it
isn't
moot.
i
just
see
--
i
just
suggest
that
to
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
then
i
take
it
to
your
position
on
mootness,
it
would
be
the
same
whether
or
not
the
court
of
appeals
had
disapproved
the
10
months
injunction.
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
that
it
had
approved
both
injunctions,
the
temporary
injunction
and
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
10
months
injunction.
justice
byron
r.
white
your
issue
at
here
would
be
quite
just
the
same,
even
though
the
maryland
court
had
made
this
kind
of
a
ruling,
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
maybe
so
as
the
procedural
matter,
but
if
you're
just
talking
mootness
why
is
it
a
little
different
slightly
to
this?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
rule
established
by
maryland
court
of
appeals,
you
want
to
get
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
the
--
were
there
any
ordinance,
local
ordinances
or
statutes
directly
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
on
the
basis
of
these
observation.
this
was
the
judicial
actual
remedy
in
a
(voice

--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
under
no
ordinance
or
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
had
noticed
that
your
permanent
injunction
or
your
10
months
injunction
is
considerably
narrower
than
the
temporary,
the
ex
parte
restraining
order.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
was
narrower
in
the
kind
of
meetings
that
it
prevented.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
this
party
could
have
gone
and
had
meetings
under
these
10
months
injunction.
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
your
justification
for
the
temporary
restraining
order
where
it
is
enjoined
all
meetings
whether
they
would
incite
racial
violence
or
not.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
maryland
contend
here
that
the
temporary
ex

injunction
was
validly
issued?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
at
least
the
--
your
highest

said
that
it
was
a

justice
byron

white
so
this
is
(voice

--
this
is
the
rule
--
is
this
a
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
this
is
an
interpretation
by
the
maryland
courts,
by
the

of

as
to
what
kind
of
conduct
that

would
justify
an

as
a

justice
byron
r.
white
and
now
that
is
--
so
there
is
an
interpretation
of
the
first
amendment
or
of
the
maryland
law
has
been
permissible
under
the
first
amendment
which

and
which

justice
byron

well,
then
that's
a
--
that's
another
--
we're
still
talking
on
mootness.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
rule
is
one
that
obtains

now
and
that
this
group,
which
was
enjoined
is
subject

all

justice
byron

now
why
would
you
suggest
it
that
that
this

who
is,
you
don't

but
it
must
have,
it
must
now
in
maryland
observe
this
rule.
justice
byron

i

but
the
ruling
that,
the
ruling
that
