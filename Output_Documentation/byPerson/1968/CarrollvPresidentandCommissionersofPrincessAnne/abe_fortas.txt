justice
abe
fortas
mrs.
norton,
i'm
not
clear
from
or
and
i
have
read
as
for
whether
there
was
in
the
community,
state
of
tension
at
the
time
that
this
rally
took
place.
where
have
--
where
had
there
have
been
disorders?
was
there
trouble
in
the
community?
justice
abe
fortas
ah,
mrs.
norton,
i
have
a
little
trouble
by
the
procedural
aspects
of
this
case.
actually,
what
happened
here
was
that
an
ex
parte
injunction
was
issued
and
then
later
on,
two
ex
parte
injunction
was
issued
to
restrain
the
petitioners
from
holding
a
meeting
in
10
days.
then
later
on,
there
was
an
interlocutory
some
sort
of
a
interlocutory
order
entered
to
restrain
petitioners
for
10
months?
justice
abe
fortas
now
did
that
--
now
and
but
you're
arguing
this
case
as
if
what
we
have
before
is
the
ex
parte
order,
the
first
order.
was
the
second
order
ex
parte
also?
justice
abe
fortas
now
why
is
it
referred
to
in
the
papers
that
we
have
before
us
here
as
an
interlocutory
order?
it
went
to
the
maryland
then
an
appeal
was
taken
at
the
maryland
court
of
appeals
was
it
not?
justice
abe
fortas
all
right
but
and
you
make
no
point
of
that
in
your
adversary
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
makes
no
point
of
that.
so,
the
--
then
there
was
an
appeal
taken
to
the
maryland
court
of
appeals,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
and
the
maryland
--
didn't
the
maryland
court
of
appeals
indicate
in
some
way
that
the
ex
parte
order
was
invalid?
justice
abe
fortas
and
how
about
the
next
order
in
the
10-month
order.
justice
abe
fortas
well
now,
so
that
what
we
have
before
in
your
submission
is
only
the
ex
parte
order?
justice
abe
fortas
and
that
ex
parte
order
enjoined
a
particular
--
enjoined
defendant's
from
holding
a
particular
proposed
meeting.
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
for
10
days
only.
justice
abe
fortas
and
we
don't
have
before
as
a
subsequent
order
which
was
a
10-month
order.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
(inaudible)
eliminates
the
reason
why
i
have
considerable
procedural
difficulty
with
this
case.
now,
also
as
i
understand
it
somewhere
in
these
papers,
the
petitioners
subsequently
applied
for
a
permit
to
hold
a
meeting,
a
meeting
in
princess
anne
county,
i
don't
recall
the
dates.
first
time,
they
were
refused.
they
subsequently
applied
and
permit
was
granted
but
on
conditions?
justice
abe
fortas
now
what
bearing
if,
what
is
your
view
as
to
whether
those
events
have
a
bearing
upon
our
jurisdictional
and
procedural
problems?
justice
abe
fortas
in
other
words,
two
subsequent
applications.
one
denied,
the
other
granted.
justice
abe
fortas
now
is
that
before
this?
is
that
in
the
record
of
the
precise
--
are
the
terms
of
that
permit
in
the
record
has
it
been
litigated
below?
justice
abe
fortas
is
it
before
this
in
the
record?
justice
abe
fortas
but
how
is
it,
what's
the
physical
form?
justice
abe
fortas
how?
justice
abe
fortas
is
there
a
formal
permit
that's
reprinted
in
the
appendix?
justice
abe
fortas
that's
all
we
have
before
this
but
you
don't
have
the
specific
text
of
the
permit
that
you
say
was
granted
on
objection
on
conditions
that
you
assert
to
be
objectionable.
justice
abe
fortas
i
see.
justice
abe
fortas
that
is
the
form
in
which
the
permit
was
granted,
was
it?
justice
abe
fortas
well
now,
we
don't
have
before
this
the
10-month
injunction.
justice
abe
fortas
and
the
10-month
injunction
was
set
aside
by
the
maryland
court
of
appeals.
justice
abe
fortas
on
the
grounds
that
it
was
extended
for
too
long
a
period.
justice
abe
fortas
but
the
maryland
court
of
appeals
did
hold
that
the
ex
parte
order
was
properly
issued,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
and,
in
doing
so,
it
seems
to
have
addressed
itself
a
really
to
the
operation
of
the
ex
parte
order
with
respect
to
the
enjoining
of
the
meeting
that
it
was
to
be
held
the
night
following.
the
night
on
which
these
utterances
were
made.
justice
abe
fortas
and
it
said
that
what
happened
here
according
to
maryland
court
of
appeals
as
i
read
it
was
that
on
the
first
night,
the
stage
was
set
for
what
the
police
regarded
as
an
inflammatory
or
violent
situation
on
the
following
night.
justice
abe
fortas
and
i
don't
see
anything
in
here
further
long
alliance
that
my
brother
stewart
said,
i
see
nothing
in
the
maryland
court
of
appeals
opinion
with
respect
to
the
mootness
points
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
you're
not
addressing
--
you're
just
addressing
that
to
the
merits
i
trust.
justice
abe
fortas
you're
making
that
speech
in
terms
of
the
merits,
aren't
you?
justice
abe
fortas
because
some
terms
of
the
procedural
problem
that's
bothering
some
of
us,
i
don't
see
that's
gotten
much
to
do
with
it.
procedural
problem
that
bothers
me
here
is
that
the
maryland
court
of
appeals
reversed
the
10-month
order.
and
then
without
talking
about
mootness,
it
addressed
to
itself
to
a
10-day
order
which
was
from
practical
effect
to
one-day
order.
and
the
question
is,
has
the
maryland
court
of
appeals
now
made
some
decision,
an
effective
decision,
which
has
a
first
amendment
effect
of
which
we
can
take
cognizance
within
our
constitutional
limitations.
justice
abe
fortas
that's
the
problem
is
i
see
it.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
do
take
it
that
that
is
an
issue
in
this
case?
i
didn't
know
that
anybody
was
doubting
whether
they
can
issue
an
injunction.
the
question
is,
what
if
you
reach
some
merits,
the
question
is,
these
circumstances
such
that
the
injunction
is
a
violate
injunction.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
like
in
freidman,
an
argument
by
analogy
to
freidman
as
i
understand
it,
which
is
at
the
procedure
in
maryland
for
challenging
the
ex
parte
order
is
not
adequate
to
protect
the
constitutional
right.
but
i
didn't
understand
that
they
say
that
can
issue
an
ex
parte
injunction
at
least,
in
appropriate
circumstances.
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that.
justice
abe
fortas
mrs.
norton,
i'm

was

justice

ah,
mrs.

i
have
a

by
the
procedural

of

was

abe
fortas
now
why
is
it
referred
to
in
the
papers
that
we
have
before
us
here
as
an
interlocutory
order?
it
went
to
the
maryland
then
an
appeal
was
taken
at
the
maryland
court
of

was
it
not?
justice

all
right
but
and
you
make
no

justice

so,
the

then
there

of

is

how
about

so
that

that
