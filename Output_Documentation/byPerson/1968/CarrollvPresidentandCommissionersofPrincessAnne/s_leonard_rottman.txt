mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
first
point
out
that
there
are
a
great
deal
of
matters
which
are
in
the
appendix
in
this
case
and
in
the
supplemental
brief
which
are
not
part
of
the
record
in
this
case.
there
were
matters
involving
the
issuance
of
the
subsequent
petition.
the
attempts
to
obtain
trial
counsel
those
such
items.
they
are
not
properly
before
this
court
we
would
submit.
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
yes
sir.
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
thank
you.
i
would
like
to,
with
that
in
mind,
i
would
to
comment
very
briefly
on
the
issue
of
mootness.
and
it
would
seem
to
us
and
we
submit
that
any
decision
at
this
court
may
make
in
this
particular
case
would
be
moot
and
would
operate
purely
in
a
vacuum.
and
therefore
the
case
is
moot
and
should
not
be
considered
by
the
court
on
the
merits.
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
yes
sir.
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
i
think
this
year
your
honor,
i
think
that
under
the
maryland
rules,
there
is
an
absolute
right
to
a
hearing
with
two
days
notice.
these
petitioners
did
not
avail
themselves
of
that.
they
say
they
had
difficulty
getting
counsel
and
yet
one
of
their
petitioners,
mr.
stone,
is
an
attorney
and
had
only
the
preceding
week
appeared
in
baltimore
on
a
similar
case,
in
which
the
national
states
rights
party
was
enjoined.
he
appeared
and
represented
them
in
that
case.
i
would
say
that
there
is
an
absolute
right
to
a
two-day
hearing
on
the
injunctions.
and
under
the
decisions
of
this
court,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
test
is
the
quickness
with
which
you
can
get
a
judicial
review.
the
first
instance
of
a
court
reviewing,
the
right
of
the
restraint
on
speech
and
maryland
has
specifically
provided
the
two-day
test,
two-day
hearing.
they
can
have
it
on
that.
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
no
sir,
they
can
have
a
hearing.
they
can
have
a
hearing
or
not
less
than
two
days
notice.
so
if
they're
request
a
hearing,
they
must
have
it
within
at
least
two
days.
i
believe
that's
the
interpretation
that's
consistently
been
given
in
maryland
and
that's
the
way
the
rule
reads.
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
no,
i
have
no
maryland
cases
cited,
your
honor.
i
have
a
reference
to
the
maryland
rule.
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
i
know
the
application
of
that
rule.
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
the
rule
reads
that
a
party
has
an
absolute
right
to
a
hearing
on
two
days
notice
on
the
issuance
of
an
ex
parte
injunction.
and
the
practice
in
maryland
and
mrs.
norton
says
that
it's
an
unusual
practice
issue
to
issue
a
temporary
injunction,
i
would
submit
that
that
is
not
so
your
honors.
i've
only
been
at
the
bar
some
10
years
now
but
i've
been
involved
and
i'm
not
particularly
do
a
great
deal
of
trial
work,
but
i've
been
involved
in
probably
no
less
than
five.
in
my
own
experience
in
ex
parte
injunctions
and
the
maryland
courts
uniformly
grant
a
hearing
on
two
days
notice
on
application
of
one
of
the
parties.
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
they
may
not
have
been
served
your
honor,
but
i
would
submit
that
if
they
were
not
served,
they
weren't
subject
to
the
hearing.
they
weren't
subject
to
the
injunction
then.
again
under
maryland
rules,
you're
not
subject
to
the
injunction
until
it's
brought
to
your
notice.
now,
they
certainly
came
in
and
were
aware
of
it
as
a
practical
matter.
they
were
all
very
much
aware
of
the
injunction.
we
believe
that
the
--
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
absolutely.
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
yes
sir,
they
said
that
the
existence
of
the
clear
and
present
danger
of
a
riot
in
the
streets
of
princess
anne
justifies
--
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
i
believe
you
could
say
that,
yes
sir.
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
i
believe
that
so
your
honor
but
i
don't
think
that
the
maryland
court
of
appeals
broke
any
new
ground
in
doing
it.
all
they
did
--
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
i
see.
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
that's
right
your
honor.
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
well,
this
was
a
--
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
i
shall
try
to
your
honor.
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
justice
white,
in
answer
to
your
inquiry,
i
would
say
that
the
answer
is
that
it
is
moot
because
the
injunction
was
issued
in
the
context
of
a
specific
factual
situation,
which
may
never
exist
again.
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
well,
i
think
that
that
--
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
well,
i
would
suggest
that
that
law
as
you
pointed
out
sir,
is
the
law
ever
since
milk
wagon
drivers
union
versus
meadowmoor
in
which
this
court
recognized.
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
yes
sir.
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
well,
if
i
may
--
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
if
the
issue
is
to
come
before
this
court
on
this
injunction
and
in
this
context
that
the
way
to
get
it
before
the
court
is
to
allow
the
petitioners
to
violate
the
injunction,
and
subject
themselves
to
the
contempt
penalties
and
bring
it
up
in
that
factual
situation.
because
if
this
court
has
to
pronounce
a
rule
as
to
whether
it
will
consider
all
cases
not
moot
and
not
follow
its
general
principles
of
only
considering
live
cases
as
against
to
--
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
i
don't
think
that
that
is
the
pronouncement
in
walker
your
honor.
i
think
this
court
went
a
good
deal
out
of
its
way
in
walker
to
point
out
that
the
petitioners
in
that
case
had
taken
no
steps.
they
had
taken
no
steps
to
contest
the
issuance
of
the
injunction
and
the
court
made
it
very
clear
i
think,
they
were
clearly
put
on
notice
that
they
could
not
bypass
orderly
judicial
review
of
the
injunction
before
disobeying
it.
and
i
think
that
case,
what
it
does
is
recognize
that
you
must
first,
in
the
initial
instance
object
to
the
issuance
of
the
injunction.
if
it
is
then
issued
and
if
you
may
then
object
to
it,
and
if
it
may
run
out
before
you
have
time
to
follow
through
all
the
way
to
this
court
if
you
will.
then
you
have
the
right
to
protest
the
issuance
of
the
injunction
and
if
the
injunction
was
wrongly
issued,
their
conviction
under
it
would
be
reversed.
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
i
don't
mean
say
if
they
could
violate
with
impunity
but
i
think
the
way
to
get
it
before
this
court
in
a
live
issue
and
not
a
moot
issue,
would
be
de-violated.
if
the
balancing
of
the
equities
must
be
between
the
protection
of
the
state
in
holding
safe
its
streets
by
allowing
them
to
issue
injunctions
or
if
its
to
force
petitioners
and
those
in
their
position
to
test
injunctions
in
a
live
issue
by
contesting
it
and
subjecting
themselves
to
criminal
penalties.
i
would
say
that
the
better
rule
would
be
to
force
them
to
take
the
burden
of
criminal
punishment
than
rather
to
force
the
state
to
take
the
burden
of
allowing
their
streets
to
be
the
subject
of
rioting
over
any
issue
that
speakers
may
wish
to
make.
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
had
approved
the
10
months
injunction?
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
yes
sir.
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
it
would
basically
be
the
same.
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
yes
sir,
because
it
seems
to
us
that
the
holding
in
freidman
was
and
the
thinking
in
freidman
expressed
by
this
court
is
that
it's
the
initial
judicial
review
that's
important.
it's
not
carrying
all
the
way
through
to
the
appellate
reviews
as
to
before
this
very
court.
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
well,
it's
our
position
that
if
this
case
--
in
this
context
is
moot.
if
you
do
want
to
consider
this
case
however
on
the
merits
of
it,
and
we'll
go
on
to
discus
that
if
we
will.
the
issue,
the
principle
issue
before
this
court
on
the
merits
of
the
case
is
the
right
of
a
state
as
we
see
it,
is
the
right
of
a
state
to
ever
act
to
prevent
certain
classes
of
speech.
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
i
believe
not.
of
course
the
10-month
injunction,
what
was
called
the
interlocutory
injunction
at
that
point,
was
not
moot.
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
that
was
still
in
effect,
that's
right.
the
reversal
was
passed
by
the
maryland
court
of
appeals,
part
of
the
expiration
of
that
interlocutory
injunction.
by
the
way,
i
may
say
in
passing
that
i
think
the
term
interlocutory
was
simply
used
to
distinguish
it
from
a
permanent
injunction.
it
was
no
question
about
being
a
final
order
but
it
was
a
final
temporary
in
effect
that
it
expired
from
a
given
period
of
time.
it
was
not
an
unlimited
injunction.
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
i
believe
not
your
honor.
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
that's
correct.
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
that's
right.
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
that's
correct.
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
yes
sir.
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
that's
correct.
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
that's
correct,
they
did
not
consider.
and
we
would
suggest
that
the
maryland
court
of
appeals
affirm
this
decision
on
the
issuance
of
the
existence
of
a
clear
and
present
danger
at
the
time
the
temporary
10-day
injunction
was
issued.
now
if
--
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
you
say
if
they
would.
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
it
would
depend
i
would
submit
on
the
background
facts.
was
there
a
context
of
violence
in
the
background
at
the
time
they
attempted
to
speak?
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
i
don't
know
that
the
tapes
are
particularly,
they
are
important
because
they
are
the
words
that
created
--
helped
create
the
clear
and
present
danger
but
there
was
a
background
of
violence
which
was
also
significant
at
the
time
of
this
particular
incident.
these
petitioners
had
spoken
about
three
or
four
days
prior
in
baltimore
city.
and
their
speeches
in
baltimore
city
had
created
a
riot
that
matters
before
this
court
on
petition
for
their
conviction
for
inciting
the
riot,
right
now.
the
state
of
maryland
is
a
reasonably
small
state.
all
three
of
the
baltimore
city
television
stations
are
being
into
princess
anne.
the
three
baltimore
city
newspapers,
the
existence
of
that
riot
had
been
given
wide
coverage
throughout
maryland
and
particularly
in
princess
anne.
not
particularly
but
in
princess
anne.
first
thing
petitioners
said
when
they
came
down,
“did
you
heard
of
us
in
baltimore?”
they
drew
a
specific
reference
to
their
speeches
in
baltimore.
it
was
set
in
a
background
of
violence
knowing
that
the
tapes
will
not
justify
the
issuance
of
the
injunction.
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
it
would
depend
i
submit
not
on
what
they
said
but
the
result
of
what
happened.
i
think
--
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
could
the
--
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
could
they?
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
disregarding
whether
they
felt
there
was
a
clear
present
danger
or.
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
yes
they
could
do
it.
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
if
they
issued
ex
parte
injunction
and
that
was
signed,
i
think
that's
your
question.
they
could
have
a
hearing,
a
full
hearing
with
testimony
before
the
maryland
circuit
court
in
princess
anne
on
two
days
notice.
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
i
didn't
realize
that
i
have
to
print
in
my
replied
brief.
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
yes,
that
i
reprint
the
rule,
i
wasn't
aware
of
it.
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
oh,
the
reply
brief,
yes.
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
yes,
it
may
be.
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
that
if
it
expired
within
those
10
days,
the
case
would
be
moot,
unless
--
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
without
the
circuit
court
deciding
the
extension.
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
yes
sir.
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
yes
sir.
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
yes
sir,
we
would
believe
it
would
be
moot.
they
would
--
their
only
alternative
for
contesting
that
injunction
would
be
to
violate
it
and
to
bring
it
here.
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
would
be
to
violate
it
and
bring
it
here.
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
after
the
10
days.
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
that's
correct.
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
no
sir.
not
a
final
decision
would
--
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
well,
i
say
no.
i
say
no.
there's
no
set
procedure.
the
maryland
court
of
appeals
on
a
number
of
instances
have
--
has
heard
cases
advanced
on
its
docket
and
it
is
heard
to
my
--
i
think
i
know
of
cases
that
will
come
up
between
trial
and
final
argument
within
five
days.
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
in
most
instances
it
could
your
honor.
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
in
most
instances
it
could.
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
that's
correct.
i
would
submit
that
that
is
correct.
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
i
think
that
if
you
must
balance
the
right
of
the
state
to
protect
its
streets
and
make
it
safe
for
its
citizens,
so
that
their
constitutional
rights
maybe
protected
by
preventing
violence
speech,
and
forcing
people
who
wish
to
stretch
the
limits
of
their
right
to
violating
an
injunction
which
they
consider
to
be
wrong.
i
think
the
burden
must
lie
on
those
who
wish
to
stretch
their
right
of
free
speech,
because
i
think
you
must
recognize
your
honors,
that
if
you
say
that
a
state
may
not
by
injunctive
action,
prevent
speech
even
speech
which
will
create
a
clear
and
present
danger.
which
will
create
an
absolute
riot
as
these
petitioners
did
in
baltimore
city.
that
you
are
of
necessity
saying
that
you're
going
to
deprive
other
citizens
of
their
constitutional
rights
of
being
safe
and
secure
in
their
person
and
property.
because
this
court
has
pronounced
on
many
occasions,
that
there
is
speech
which
creates
violence.
speech
sets
off
the
motor
equipment
that
is
violence.
and
when
that
violence
is
set
loose,
then
other
citizens
are
denied
their
rights.
witness
the
incident
that
happened
in
baltimore
city.
when
after
these
petitioners
spoke
before
they
were
enjoined
in
baltimore
city,
an
innocent
12
year
old
boy
was
walking
down
the
street
in
a
patterson
park
with
his
dog,
a
negro
boy
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
rallies,
he
was
three
blocks
from
the
rallies,
and
the
crowd
from
the
rallies
just
swept
up
and
beat
him.
they
put
a
rope
around
his
neck,
and
if
it
hadn't
have
been
for
prompt
police
action,
he
would
have
been
deprived
his
ultimate
civil
liberty.
now,
if
you're
not
going
to
permit
the
state
court's
to
enjoin
this
kind
of
speech
which
will
set
off
that,
then
you've
got
to
recognize
that
you're
granting
someone
the
right
to
exercise
or
abuse
his
constitutional
privilege
at
the
expense
of
denying
that
to
other
citizen,
because
the
state
is
not
--
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
yes
sir,
it
goes
to
the
merits
of
the
issue.
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
well,
it
has
taken
--
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
it
has
taken
cognizance
of
that
fact
that
it
can
issue
was
the
lower
courts
in
maryland
can
issue
injunctions
that
they
have
done.
we
would
submit
that
that
is
correct
and
on
the
mootness
issue.
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
my
understanding
from
listening
to
mrs.
norton
and
in
their
brief
that
that's
the
very
issue
they
raised
is,
"should
a
state
court
ever
have
the
right
to
issue
an
injunction?"
and
we've
address
to
ourselves
for
that
someone
extensively.
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
freidman
didn't
deal
with
an
injunction
at
all.
freidman
dealt
with
the
censorship
law.
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
and
by
the
way,
we
would
point
out
that
freidman
made
it
clear
that
what
is
required
is
some
procedural
requirement
of
a
prompt
judicial
hearing.
and
we
submit
that
under
the
maryland
rule
bb72
there
is
that
availability.
your
honor's
i
have,
i
believe
taken
up
most
of
my
time
and
i
want
to
leave
a
few
minutes
for
mr.
jones
to
tell
you
and
address
you
on
the
question
of
the
existence
of
the
clear
and
present
danger
in
this
particular
instance.
he
was
on
the
scene
at
the
time
and
i
think
he
can
he
address
himself
best
to
that.
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
first
point
out
that
there
are
a
great
deal
of
matters
which
are
in
the
appendix
in
this
case
and
in
the
supplemental
brief
which
are
not
part
of
the
record
in
this
case.
there
were
matters
involving
the
issuance
of
the
subsequent
petition.
the
attempts
to
obtain
trial
counsel
those
such
items.
they
are
not
properly
before
this
court
we
would
submit.
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
yes
sir.
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
thank
you.
i
would
like
to,
with
that
in
mind,
i
would
to
comment
very
briefly
on
the
issue
of
mootness.
and
it
would
seem
to
us
and
we
submit
that
any
decision
at
this
court
may
make
in
this
particular
case
would
be
moot
and
would
operate
purely
in
a
vacuum.
and
therefore
the
case
is
moot
and
should
not
be
considered
by
the
court
on
the
merits.
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
yes
sir.
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
i
think
this
year
your
honor,
i
think
that
under
the
maryland
rules,
there
is
an
absolute
right
to
a
hearing
with
two
days
notice.
these
petitioners
did
not
avail
themselves
of
that.
they
say
they
had
difficulty
getting
counsel
and
yet
one
of
their
petitioners,
mr.
stone,
is
an
attorney
and
had
only
the
preceding
week
appeared
in
baltimore
on
a
similar
case,
in
which
the
national
states
rights
party
was
enjoined.
he
appeared
and
represented
them
in
that
case.
i
would
say
that
there
is
an
absolute
right
to
a
two-day
hearing
on
the
injunctions.
and
under
the
decisions
of
this
court,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
test
is
the
quickness
with
which
you
can
get
a
judicial
review.
the
first
instance
of
a
court
reviewing,
the
right
of
the
restraint
on
speech
and
maryland
has
specifically
provided
the
two-day
test,
two-day
hearing.
they
can
have
it
on
that.
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
no
sir,
they
can
have
a
hearing.
they
can
have
a
hearing
or
not
less
than
two
days
notice.
so
if
they're
request
a
hearing,
they
must
have
it
within
at
least
two
days.
i
believe
that's
the
interpretation
that's
consistently
been
given
in
maryland
and
that's
the
way
the
rule
reads.
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
no,
i
have
no
maryland
cases
cited,
your
honor.
i
have
a
reference
to
the
maryland
rule.
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
i
know
the
application
of
that
rule.
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
the
rule
reads
that
a
party
has
an
absolute
right
to
a
hearing
on
two
days
notice
on
the
issuance
of
an
ex
parte
injunction.
and
the
practice
in
maryland
and
mrs.
norton
says
that
it's
an
unusual
practice
issue
to
issue
a
temporary
injunction,
i
would
submit
that
that
is
not
so
your
honors.
i've
only
been
at
the
bar
some
10
years
now
but
i've
been
involved
and
i'm
not
particularly
do
a
great
deal
of
trial
work,
but
i've
been
involved
in
probably
no
less
than
five.
in
my
own
experience
in
ex
parte
injunctions
and
the
maryland
courts
uniformly
grant
a
hearing
on
two
days
notice
on
application
of
one
of
the
parties.
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
they
may
not
have
been
served
your
honor,
but
i
would
submit
that
if
they
were
not
served,
they
weren't
subject
to
the
hearing.
they
weren't
subject
to
the
injunction
then.
again
under
maryland
rules,
you're
not
subject
to
the
injunction
until
it's
brought
to
your
notice.
now,
they
certainly
came
in
and
were
aware
of
it
as
a
practical
matter.
they
were
all
very
much
aware
of
the
injunction.
we
believe
that
the
--
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
absolutely.
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
yes
sir,
they
said
that
the
existence
of
the
clear
and
present
danger
of
a
riot
in
the
streets
of
princess
anne
justifies
--
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
i
believe
you
could
say
that,
yes
sir.
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
i
believe
that
so
your
honor
but
i
don't
think
that
the
maryland
court
of
appeals
broke
any
new
ground
in
doing
it.
all
they
did
--
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
i
see.
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
that's
right
your
honor.
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
well,
this
was
a
--
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
i
shall
try
to
your
honor.
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
justice
white,
in
answer
to
your
inquiry,
i
would
say
that
the
answer
is
that
it
is
moot
because
the
injunction
was
issued
in
the
context
of
a
specific
factual
situation,
which
may
never
exist
again.
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
well,
i
think
that
that
--
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
well,
i
would
suggest
that
that
law
as
you
pointed
out
sir,
is
the
law
ever
since
milk
wagon
drivers
union
versus
meadowmoor
in
which
this
court
recognized.
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
yes
sir.
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
well,
if
i
may
--
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
if
the
issue
is
to
come
before
this
court
on
this
injunction
and
in
this
context
that
the
way
to
get
it
before
the
court
is
to
allow
the
petitioners
to
violate
the
injunction,
and
subject
themselves
to
the
contempt
penalties
and
bring
it
up
in
that
factual
situation.
because
if
this
court
has
to
pronounce
a
rule
as
to
whether
it
will
consider
all
cases
not
moot
and
not
follow
its
general
principles
of
only
considering
live
cases
as
against
to
--
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
i
don't
think
that
that
is
the
pronouncement
in
walker
your
honor.
i
think
this
court
went
a
good
deal
out
of
its
way
in
walker
to
point
out
that
the
petitioners
in
that
case
had
taken
no
steps.
they
had
taken
no
steps
to
contest
the
issuance
of
the
injunction
and
the
court
made
it
very
clear
i
think,
they
were
clearly
put
on
notice
that
they
could
not
bypass
orderly
judicial
review
of
the
injunction
before
disobeying
it.
and
i
think
that
case,
what
it
does
is
recognize
that
you
must
first,
in
the
initial
instance
object
to
the
issuance
of
the
injunction.
if
it
is
then
issued
and
if
you
may
then
object
to
it,
and
if
it
may
run
out
before
you
have
time
to
follow
through
all
the
way
to
this
court
if
you
will.
then
you
have
the
right
to
protest
the
issuance
of
the
injunction
and
if
the
injunction
was
wrongly
issued,
their
conviction
under
it
would
be
reversed.
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
i
don't
mean
say
if
they
could
violate
with
impunity
but
i
think
the
way
to
get
it
before
this
court
in
a
live
issue
and
not
a
moot
issue,
would
be
de-violated.
if
the
balancing
of
the
equities
must
be
between
the
protection
of
the
state
in
holding
safe
its
streets
by
allowing
them
to
issue
injunctions
or
if
its
to
force
petitioners
and
those
in
their
position
to
test
injunctions
in
a
live
issue
by
contesting
it
and
subjecting
themselves
to
criminal
penalties.
i
would
say
that
the
better
rule
would
be
to
force
them
to
take
the
burden
of
criminal
punishment
than
rather
to
force
the
state
to
take
the
burden
of
allowing
their
streets
to
be
the
subject
of
rioting
over
any
issue
that
speakers
may
wish
to
make.
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
had
approved
the
10
months
injunction?
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
yes
sir.
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
it
would
basically
be
the
same.
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
yes
sir,
because
it
seems
to
us
that
the
holding
in
freidman
was
and
the
thinking
in
freidman
expressed
by
this
court
is
that
it's
the
initial
judicial
review
that's
important.
it's
not
carrying
all
the
way
through
to
the
appellate
reviews
as
to
before
this
very
court.
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
well,
it's
our
position
that
if
this
case
--
in
this
context
is
moot.
if
you
do
want
to
consider
this
case
however
on
the
merits
of
it,
and
we'll
go
on
to
discus
that
if
we
will.
the
issue,
the
principle
issue
before
this
court
on
the
merits
of
the
case
is
the
right
of
a
state
as
we
see
it,
is
the
right
of
a
state
to
ever
act
to
prevent
certain
classes
of
speech.
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
i
believe
not.
of
course
the
10-month
injunction,
what
was
called
the
interlocutory
injunction
at
that
point,
was
not
moot.
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
that
was
still
in
effect,
that's
right.
the
reversal
was
passed
by
the
maryland
court
of
appeals,
part
of
the
expiration
of
that
interlocutory
injunction.
by
the
way,
i
may
say
in
passing
that
i
think
the
term
interlocutory
was
simply
used
to
distinguish
it
from
a
permanent
injunction.
it
was
no
question
about
being
a
final
order
but
it
was
a
final
temporary
in
effect
that
it
expired
from
a
given
period
of
time.
it
was
not
an
unlimited
injunction.
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
i
believe
not
your
honor.
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
that's
correct.
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
that's
right.
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
that's
correct.
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
yes
sir.
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
that's
correct.
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
that's
correct,
they
did
not
consider.
and
we
would
suggest
that
the
maryland
court
of
appeals
affirm
this
decision
on
the
issuance
of
the
existence
of
a
clear
and
present
danger
at
the
time
the
temporary
10-day
injunction
was
issued.
now
if
--
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
you
say
if
they
would.
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
it
would
depend
i
would
submit
on
the
background
facts.
was
there
a
context
of
violence
in
the
background
at
the
time
they
attempted
to
speak?
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
i
don't
know
that
the
tapes
are
particularly,
they
are
important
because
they
are
the
words
that
created
--
helped
create
the
clear
and
present
danger
but
there
was
a
background
of
violence
which
was
also
significant
at
the
time
of
this
particular
incident.
these
petitioners
had
spoken
about
three
or
four
days
prior
in
baltimore
city.
and
their
speeches
in
baltimore
city
had
created
a
riot
that
matters
before
this
court
on
petition
for
their
conviction
for
inciting
the
riot,
right
now.
the
state
of
maryland
is
a
reasonably
small
state.
all
three
of
the
baltimore
city
television
stations
are
being
into
princess
anne.
the
three
baltimore
city
newspapers,
the
existence
of
that
riot
had
been
given
wide
coverage
throughout
maryland
and
particularly
in
princess
anne.
not
particularly
but
in
princess
anne.
first
thing
petitioners
said
when
they
came
down,
“did
you
heard
of
us
in
baltimore?”
they
drew
a
specific
reference
to
their
speeches
in
baltimore.
it
was
set
in
a
background
of
violence
knowing
that
the
tapes
will
not
justify
the
issuance
of
the
injunction.
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
it
would
depend
i
submit
not
on
what
they
said
but
the
result
of
what
happened.
i
think
--
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
could
the
--
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
could
they?
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
disregarding
whether
they
felt
there
was
a
clear
present
danger
or.
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
yes
they
could
do
it.
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
if
they
issued
ex
parte
injunction
and
that
was
signed,
i
think
that's
your
question.
they
could
have
a
hearing,
a
full
hearing
with
testimony
before
the
maryland
circuit
court
in
princess
anne
on
two
days
notice.
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
i
didn't
realize
that
i
have
to
print
in
my
replied
brief.
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
yes,
that
i
reprint
the
rule,
i
wasn't
aware
of
it.
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
oh,
the
reply
brief,
yes.
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
yes,
it
may
be.
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
that
if
it
expired
within
those
10
days,
the
case
would
be
moot,
unless
--
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
without
the
circuit
court
deciding
the
extension.
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
yes
sir.
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
yes
sir.
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
yes
sir,
we
would
believe
it
would
be
moot.
they
would
--
their
only
alternative
for
contesting
that
injunction
would
be
to
violate
it
and
to
bring
it
here.
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
would
be
to
violate
it
and
bring
it
here.
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
after
the
10
days.
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
that's
correct.
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
no
sir.
not
a
final
decision
would
--
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
well,
i
say
no.
i
say
no.
there's
no
set
procedure.
the
maryland
court
of
appeals
on
a
number
of
instances
have
--
has
heard
cases
advanced
on
its
docket
and
it
is
heard
to
my
--
i
think
i
know
of
cases
that
will
come
up
between
trial
and
final
argument
within
five
days.
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
in
most
instances
it
could
your
honor.
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
in
most
instances
it
could.
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
that's
correct.
i
would
submit
that
that
is
correct.
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
i
think
that
if
you
must
balance
the
right
of
the
state
to
protect
its
streets
and
make
it
safe
for
its
citizens,
so
that
their
constitutional
rights
maybe
protected
by
preventing
violence
speech,
and
forcing
people
who
wish
to
stretch
the
limits
of
their
right
to
violating
an
injunction
which
they
consider
to
be
wrong.
i
think
the
burden
must
lie
on
those
who
wish
to
stretch
their
right
of
free
speech,
because
i
think
you
must
recognize
your
honors,
that
if
you
say
that
a
state
may
not
by
injunctive
action,
prevent
speech
even
speech
which
will
create
a
clear
and
present
danger.
which
will
create
an
absolute
riot
as
these
petitioners
did
in
baltimore
city.
that
you
are
of
necessity
saying
that
you're
going
to
deprive
other
citizens
of
their
constitutional
rights
of
being
safe
and
secure
in
their
person
and
property.
because
this
court
has
pronounced
on
many
occasions,
that
there
is
speech
which
creates
violence.
speech
sets
off
the
motor
equipment
that
is
violence.
and
when
that
violence
is
set
loose,
then
other
citizens
are
denied
their
rights.
witness
the
incident
that
happened
in
baltimore
city.
when
after
these
petitioners
spoke
before
they
were
enjoined
in
baltimore
city,
an
innocent
12
year
old
boy
was
walking
down
the
street
in
a
patterson
park
with
his
dog,
a
negro
boy
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
rallies,
he
was
three
blocks
from
the
rallies,
and
the
crowd
from
the
rallies
just
swept
up
and
beat
him.
they
put
a
rope
around
his
neck,
and
if
it
hadn't
have
been
for
prompt
police
action,
he
would
have
been
deprived
his
ultimate
civil
liberty.
now,
if
you're
not
going
to
permit
the
state
court's
to
enjoin
this
kind
of
speech
which
will
set
off
that,
then
you've
got
to
recognize
that
you're
granting
someone
the
right
to
exercise
or
abuse
his
constitutional
privilege
at
the
expense
of
denying
that
to
other
citizen,
because
the
state
is
not

mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
yes
sir,
it
goes
to
the
merits
of
the
issue.
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
well,
it
has
taken
--
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
it
has
taken
cognizance
of
that
fact
that
it
can
issue
was
the
lower
courts
in
maryland
can
issue
injunctions
that
they
have
done.
we
would
submit
that
that
is
correct
and
on
the
mootness
issue.
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
my
understanding
from
listening
to
mrs.
norton
and
in
their
brief
that
that's
the
very
issue
they
raised
is,
"should
a
state
court
ever
have
the
right
to
issue
an
injunction?"
and
we've
address
to
ourselves
for
that
someone
extensively.
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
freidman
didn't
deal
with
an
injunction
at
all.
freidman
dealt
with
the
censorship
law.
mr.
s.
leonard
rottman
and
by
the
way,
we
would
point
out
that
freidman
made
it
clear
that
what
is
required
is
some
procedural
requirement
of
a
prompt
judicial
hearing.
and
we
submit
that
under
the
maryland
rule
bb72
there
is
that
availability.
your
honor's
i
have,
i
believe
taken
up
most
of
my
time
and
i
want
to
leave
a
few
minutes
for
mr.
jones
to
tell
you
and
address
you
on
the
question
of
the
existence
of
the
clear
and
present
danger
in
this
particular
instance.
he
was
on
the
scene
at
the
time
and
i
think
he
can
he
address
himself
best
to
that.
