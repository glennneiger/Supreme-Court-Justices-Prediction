chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
rottman,
may
i
just
suggest
to
you
before
you
get
into
your
argument
that
we
have
done
in
this
case
what
we
don't
usually
do.
we
have
exceeded
to
the
request
of
both
sides
to
allow
two
lawyers
to
talk.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
the
reason
we
don't
do
that
normally
is
because
we
run
over
and
don't
keep
our
cases
within
the
calendar.
and
i
just
suggest
to
you
that
if
you
want
time
for
mr.
jones
that
you
do
what
i
suggested
on
the
other
side,
keep
it
within
bounds.
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
answer
that
after
the
lunch

recess
please?
chief

have
to
decide
it.

beg
your
pardon?
