mr.
william
h.
zinman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i'll
address
my
remarks
specifically
to
some
of
the
procedure
to
which
justice
fortas
referred.
were
within
the
context
actually
of
the
freidman
case
which
we
were
urge
a
speedy
determination
from
the
lowest
court
to
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland.
the
ex
parte
injunction
was
issued
of
course
on
the
affidavit
of
commissioner
d'shield
who
the
record
discloses
on
--
did
nationally
observed
the
rally
for
more
than
five
minutes
time.
nor
as
the
record
indicated
that
the
court
actually
hear
the
tape
and
the
order
of
course
continued
for
10
days.
now
within
that
period
of
time
--
oh,
and
this
order,
the
ex
parte
order
of
the
record
indicates
who
was
not
served
upon
stoner,
brailsford,
and
norton
nor
the
national
states
rights
party.
it
was
however
served
on
three
of
the
petitioners
so
that
actually
there
are
three
people
who've
never
got,
even
got
served
as
a
process.
now
ultimately
when
i
got
into
the
case
on
the
15th
of
august,
i
did
file
a
general
answer
but
of
course
the
hearing
was
scheduled
for
the
17th
which
actually
gave
us
only
two
days.
now
under
the
maryland
rules
of
procedure,
you
do
have
two
days
within
which
to
request
a
hearing
for
an
ex
parte
order.
however,
in
this
particular
case,
we
filed
affidavits
to
the
effect
that
the
petitioners
did
attempt
to
contact
two
lawyers
and
failing
that
and
also
there's
a
letter
in
the
record
which
i
sent
as
soon
i
got
into
the
case
to
the
president
of
the
bar
association
of
somerset
county.
mr.
jones
requesting
that
local
counsel
be
assigned
to
assist
us,
because
number
one,
the
distance
from
baltimore,
maryland
from
my
office
to
somerset
county
is
150
miles
and
it
takes
a
day
to
get
up
and
back.
and
secondly
i
wasn't
altogether
familiar
with
local
practice.
of
course
i
got
back
a
letter
indicating
that
this
was
an
unpopular
cause
and
half
of
the
bar
association
consisting
of
seven
around
the
other
side
of
the
case
and
that
in
any
event,
nobody
wanted
the
case.
consequently,
there
wasn't
any
real
remedy
that
these
petitioners
have.
and
we
had
a
parole
intents
and
purposes
addressed
ourselves
to
the
permanent
injunction
and
the
hearing
which
of
course
came
later.
now,
in
connection
with
our
argument
under
freidman
that
we
would
like
a
prompt
and
expedition
to
termination,
i
would
suggest
that
even
though
technically
the
interlocutory
or
permit
in
injunction
is
not
before
the
court.
from
a
practical
standpoint,
this
injunction
continued
in
effect
from
the
date
of
its
inception,
the
date
of
the
ex
parte
order,
which
was
on
the
7th,
until
june
the
7th,
1967
when
the
court
of
appeals
finally
rendered
its
decision.
during
the
interim
period,
i
would
like
this
court
gone
to
stand
that
i
made
certainly
every
effort
to
number
one,
expedite
the
case
according
to
the
maryland
rules
of
procedure
by
initially
trying
to
shorten
the
time
for
transmission
of
the
record
by
filing
a
motion
to
shorten
the
time
within
which
argument
was
to
be
held
and
even
by
sending
a
letter
to
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland,
which
is
part
of
the
record
requesting
them
to
render
an
expeditious
decision.
so
from
a
practical
standpoint,
the
defendants
were
enjoined
for
almost
nine
months,
and
i
think
that
we
would
like
the
ruling
to
the
effect
that
a
determination
of
this
kind
involving
speech
and
involving
assembly
should
be
handled
in
the
same
way
that
censorship
cases
are
handled.
that
is
that
they
should
be
able
to
get
from
the
court
of
the
lowest
instance
to
the
highest
court
in
the
state
within
the
shortest
period
of
time.
mr.
william
h.
zinman
yes.
mr.
william
h.
zinman
and
i
think
what
--
mr.
william
h.
zinman
yes
sir.
mr.
william
h.
zinman
and
i
think
that
--
mr.
william
h.
zinman
your
honor,
i
would
interpret
that
by
inference
to
mean
that
if
the
injunction
had
been
for
nine
months,
it
would
be
--
it
would
have
been
perfectly
proper.
of
course
that's
my
interpretation
because
--
but
--
because
--
mr.
william
h.
zinman
yes
sir.
mr.
william
h.
zinman
oh!
not
at
all.
i
don't
think
any
injunction
at
all
was
prompt
to
the
circumstances.
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
william
h.
zinman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i'll
address
my
remarks
specifically
to

as
the

indicated
that
the

the

continued
for
10

now
within

--
oh,
and
this

the
ex

of
the
record
indicates
who
was

it

a

an
ex
