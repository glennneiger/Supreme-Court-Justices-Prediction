justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
let's
see,
you
mean
know
as
a
personal
view
to
the
solicitor
general
and
the
assistant
attorney
general
of
this
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at
is,
does
the
government
support
the
servicemen
or
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
--
but
you've
just
said
mr.
weinstein,
the
inference
i
draw
from
that
is
that
the
solicitor
general
and
the
assistant
attorney
general's
position
is
the
official
position
of
the
united
states
government?
and
if
you
just
in
behalf
of
the
servicemen,
it's
just
that
you
have
responsibilities
under
the
statute
to
enforce
rights
of
servicemen.
but
that
the
official
position
on
the
legal
issue
is
that
expressed
by
the
solicitor
general,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that's
where
you
want
to
stand
then?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
as
i
recall
it's
not
so
long
ago,
we
had
a
case
here
of
a
tax
against
an
army
officer,
as
i
remember
it.
had
something
to
do
with
whether
he
was
taxable
on
allowances
and
something
who
was
stationed
overseas.
and
he
decided
not
to
defend.
we
granted
the
government's
petition.
he
decided
not
to
defend
and
we
assigned,
as
i
recall
it,
stanley
league
to
present
the
argument
on
that
side
of
the
case.
and
i
gather
what
you're
saying
was
narrowly
that
while
the
government's
position,
and
since
you
just
related
it,
decide
expressed
by
the
solicitor
general.
you're
in
much
the
same
position
on
behalf
of
the
serviceman
as
mr.
league
was
in
behalf
of
the
serviceman
in
that
case,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
although,
we
didn't
appoint
you,
but
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
weinstein,
do
i
understand
that
the
basic
thrust
of
your
argument
is
that
since
congress
has
said
that
possession
shall
be
treated
as
in
the
case
of
the
serviceman's
personal
property
his
possession
in
his
home
state
that
there
is
not
that
possession,
which
is
the
incident
upon
which
the
sales
tax
in
connecticut
terms?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
court
to
tell
--
that's
the
basic
thrust
of
your
argument.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
double
taxation
and
all
the
rest
of
it
is
really
quite
irrelevant.
if
you're
right
about
that,
if
congress
has
said,
“no,
you
have
to
treat
his
personal
property
as
if
it
were
in
texas,
his
domiciliary
state.”
whatever
texas
may
do
is
texas
business
as
to
sales
taxes.
but
in
any
event,
connecticut
can't
impose
a
sales
tax
because
there's
no
possession
of
the
car
in
connecticut.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
before
you
establish
this,
i
shall
ask
you
one
more
question
about
the
matter
we've
been
discussing
at
the
outset
of
your
argument?
i've
looked
at
this
arlington
case,
apparently
this
is
the
rationale
of
the
government
standing
to
bring
this
suit.
i'm
quoting
from
it,
“here
we
find
that
the
interest
of
the
national
government
in
the
proper
implementation
of
its
policies
and
programs
involving
the
national
defense
is
such
as
divest
in
it
the
non-statutory
right
to
maintain
this
action.”
under
these
circumstances,
the
incapacity
of
the
individual
plaintiff
to
maintain
his
action
is
immaterial
since
he
may
find
shelter
under
the
government's
umbrella.
now
my
question
is,
i
gather
the
policies
and
programs
of
the
united
states
when
this
action
was
brought
were
on
the
side
of
the
servicemen,
and
that
would
be
the
justification.
and
the
defense
in
issue
of
the
right
of
the
government
to
maintain
the
suit
had
been
raised.
but
now
here
we
come
to
--
when
you
come
to
this
court,
apparently
the
government's
policies
and
programs
have
changed.
does
that
have
a
bearing
on
whether
or
not
we
have
a
case
of
controversy
before
us?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no
but
it
seems
to
me
mr.
weinstein
by
the
time
it
gets
here,
if
there's
a
change
in
policies
and
programs,
why
isn't
this
moot?
why
don't
we
just
vacate
it
and
direct
all
down
the
line
to
hold
action
be
dismissed
as
moot?
the
government
now
no
longer
insists
that
it's
enforcing
its
policies
and
programs
in
the
state.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know,
but
they
can't
be
in
the
federal
court.
the
individuals
were
dismissed
here
are
just
as
they
were
dismissed
in
this
arlington
county
action.
and
we
have
the
same
situation
here
that
we
have
on
arlington
county
namely
the
only
party
before
us
as
plaintiff
is
the
united
states.
and
its
standing
to
be
here
depends
on
whether
or
not
it's
seeking
by
being
here
to
enforce
its
policies
and
programs,
and
now
it's
not.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
i'm
not
seeking
to.
i
don't
think
this
is
--
as
i
see
it
now,
i
don't
think
it's
any
issue
of
confession
of
error
at
all.
it's
a
simple
question
of
the
right
of
the
united
states
to
maintain
an
action,
which
is
not
brought
as
it
comes
to
us
to
enforce
its
policies
and
programs
in
the
interest
of
national
defense.
it
may
have
started
out
that
way,
but
that's
not
as
it's
presented
to
us.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
be
here
in
total.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
don't
know
why
they
dismissed
that
navy
commander
in
the
arlington
case,
did
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
he
was
dismissed
out
of
the
action.
the
only
--
when
this
got
before
the
court
of
appeals
as
i
read
that
opinion,
and
they
said
only
the
united
states
can
be
here
if
the
united
states
can
be
here.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
the
arlington
county
case,
i'm
sorry.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
$121.00
you
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
may
i
put
it
this
way
mr.
weinstein,
i
suppose
the
position
of
the
united
states
when
this
suit
brought
in
the
district
court
was
that
which
is
now
presented
to
us
by
the
solicitor
general
and
that
were
to
appear.
under
arlington
county,
could
not
the
district
court
have
had
to
dismiss
the
action?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
which
is
only
to
say
that
the
issue
is
the
standing
of
the
united
states
to
maintain
this
suit
in
the
federal
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
let's
see,
you
mean
know
as
a
personal
view
to
the
solicitor
general
and
the
assistant
attorney
general
of
this
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at
is,
does
the
government
support
the
servicemen
or
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
--
but
you've
just
said
mr.
weinstein,
the
inference
i
draw
from
that
is
that
the
solicitor
general
and
the
assistant
attorney
general's
position
is
the
official
position
of
the
united
states
government?
and
if
you
just
in
behalf
of
the
servicemen,
it's
just
that
you
have
responsibilities
under
the
statute
to
enforce
rights
of
servicemen.
but
that
the
official
position
on
the
legal
issue
is
that
expressed
by
the
solicitor
general,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that's
where
you
want
to
stand
then?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
as
i
recall
it's
not
so

we
had
a

and

we

he
decided

and
we
assigned,
as
i

stanley

to

the
argument
on
that
side
of
the
case.
and
i

what
you're

was
narrowly
that
while

and
since

you're

the

on
behalf
of
the
serviceman
as
mr.
league
was
in
behalf
of
the
serviceman
in
that
case,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
although,
we
didn't
appoint
you,
but
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
weinstein,
do
i
understand
that
the

thrust
of
your

is
that
since

has
said
that
possession
shall
be
treated

in
the

of
the
serviceman's
personal
property
his
possession
in
his
home
state
that
there
is
not
that
possession,
which
is
the
incident
upon
which
the
sales
tax
in
connecticut
terms?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
court
to
tell
--
that's
the
basic
thrust
of
your
argument.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
double
taxation
and
all
the
rest
of

is
really
quite

if
you're
right
about
that,
if
congress

“no,

whatever

but
in
any

connecticut

there's
