chief

it
please

since

for

the

this

united
states
is
the
remaining
party
of
the
on
the
plaintiff
side
of
the
case.my
purpose
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
was
about
to
say
mr.
justice
stewart,
my
purpose
here
is
to
advance
the
arguments
and
support
the
argument
set
forth
in
part
1
of
our
brief,
the
argument
in
behalf
of
the
servicemen.
as
part
2
of
the
brief
indicates
the
solicitor
general
and
the
assistant
attorney
general
in
charge
of
the
tax
division
cannot
subscribe
to
those
arguments
in
review
of
the
decision
below
should
not
be
sustained.
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
think
mr.
justice
brennan
that
the
--
well
i
should
--
the
way
to
put
it
is
that
we
are
here
for
all
practical
purposes
as
the
representative
as
in
effect
as
the
guardian
out
of
light
of
the
servicemen.
this
is
how
the
suit
was
brought.
these
are
the
arguments
put
forth
in
part
1
and
these
are
the
arguments
i
proposed
to
advance
here.
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
think
this
is
a
situation
where
the
government
has
whereas
perhaps
more
than
one
hat
to
the
extent
that
the
government's
function
is
to
formulate
a
litigating
position
on
behalf
of
the
department
of
justice,
which
represents
the
united
states
as
such.
that
of
course
is
formulated
by
the
solicitor
general
taking
of
course
the
counsel,
the
assistant
attorney
general.
and
--
but
i
do
not
think
that
this
is
viewed
as
a
case
where
the
primary
function
is
to
advance
a
position
of
the
united
states
as
such.
and
as
for
that
reason
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes,
i
think
that
it's
the
--
clearly
the
function
of
the
solicitor
general
to
formulate
what
you're
describing
as
the
official
position
in
this
court.
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes,
i
would.
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
think
that's
right.
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
think
the
two
views
are
the
judgment
below
should
be
affirmed,
which
i
should
like
to
advance
here.
and
the
other
view
is
that
the
judgment
below
should
be
reversed.
mr.
harris
weinstein
no.
i
think
that
reliance
is
placed
on
mr.
ahern
to
advance
that
position.
and
i
think
that
part
2
of
our
brief
indicates
that
is
not
intended
as
a
complete
development
to
those
views,
but
rather
summary
of
them
in
principal
reliance
is
placed
on
the
briefs
of
the
appellants
and
of
the
amici
curiae
on
their
side
of
the
case.
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
think
there
is
justice
white,
because
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
if
you
check
the
purest
case
justice
white,
and
if
i
were
not
here
to
advance
the
argument
on
behalf
of
the
servicemen.
let's
assume
for
the
moment
the
situation
where
the
government
simply
confesses
error
in
the
prosecution.
i
don't
think
that
that's
ever
been
considered
to
deprive
a
court
of
jurisdiction
to
decide
the
issue.
i
don't
think
that
that's
ever
been
thought
to
remove
the
basis
for
this
court
decision.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
in
where
we
sue
on
behalf
of
servicemen
in
that
representative
capacity
is
a
very
real
controversy.
the
controversy
is
between
the
services
and
the
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
think
that
would
go
far
as
a
speculation.
i
don't
know
yet.
i
can't
answer
to
that.
mr.
harris
weinstein
no.
i
don't
know.
the
brief
does
not
suggest
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
am
here
hoping
that
i'll
be
able
to
argue
the
other
side
on
behalf
of
the
servicemen.
mr.
harris
weinstein
of
the
solicitor
general.
mr.
harris
weinstein
you
mean
what
is
my
personal
opinion
on
the
matter?
mr.
harris
weinstein
well,
i
think
to
the
extent
that
my
personal
view
is
a
pertinent
and
i'm
not
sure
that
they
are,
i
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
--
i
support
your
arguments,
i'd
like
to
advance.
mr.
harris
weinstein
it's
unconventional
justice
fortas,
but
i
don't
think
unprecedented.
although,
i
would
concede
the
precedence
are
not
common.
the
one
that
has
occurred
to
me
is
the
closest
example
of
this
procedure
might
be
a
tax
case
called
kornhauser,
which
is
recorded
in
276
of
the
united
states
reports.
and
i
believe
that
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
volume
276.
as
i
say,
it's
not
unprecedented
but
hardly
common.
and
i
believe
that
if
the
court
examines
the
briefs
there,
the
court
will
find
a
comparable
kind
of
situation.
the
distinction
and
the
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
don't
think
that
there
is
a
conflict
among
--
in
the
department
of
justice
in
the
sense
that
the
officials
charged
with
the
responsibility
of
formulating
a
position
of
the
presidential
appointees
over
an
agreement,
and
their
views
are
stated
in
part
2
of
the
brief.
in
the
kornhauser
case,
i
said
the
situation
was
similar
in
this
way.
the
disagreement
was
between
the
department
of
justice
and
what
i
think
was
then
called
the
bureau
of
internal
revenue
and
the
department
of
the
treasury.
and
there
was
brief
filed
in
two
parts.
as
i
recall
it,
it
was
an
appeal
from
the
court
of
claims
involving
the
question
of
deductibility
for
income
tax
purposes
and
some
legal
fees.
and
the
court
of
claims,
as
i
recall
it,
it
allowed
the
deduction.
the
--
i'm
sorry,
had
disallowed
the
deduction.
the
treasury
thought
that
was
the
correct
view.
there
was
part
--
first
a
part
of
the
briefs
supporting
that
position
urging
affirmance.
and
the
case
was
argued,
as
i
recall
on
that,
i
beg
your
pardon,
it
was
submitted.
it
was
not
argued,
but
it
was
a
separate
part
of
that
nature
in
the
second
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
no.
but
i
think
that
you
have
a
position
of
the
united
states
in
its
capacity
as
representative
of
the
servicemen.
mr.
harris
weinstein
mr.
chief
justice,
i
don't
think
that
the
solicitor
general
assigned
me
to
appear
here
with
that
purpose
in
mind.
as
i
understand
my
assignment,
it
precedes
from
the
solicitor
general's
view
that
this
case
should
receive
a
--
an
adversarial
presentation.
and
that
the
court
should
have
before
an
adversarial
development
of
the
arguments
on
both
sides,
and
as
for
that
purpose
that
the
solicitor
general
has
assigned
me
to
come
here
and
to
present
the
arguments
on
behalf
of
the
servicemen.
and
it
is
not
that
it
is
a
matter
of
a
deputy
attempting
to
override
him.
it's
a
matter
of
having
been
assigned
to
appear
as
an
attorney
presenting
this
side
of
the
case.
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
should
think
so.
i
should
think
it's
comparable
as
i
said
before
to
perhaps
a
step
behind,
but
comparable
to
a
situation
of
a
confession
of
error.
when
you
ask
me,
mr.
justice
white,
is
there
a
case
of
controversy?
if
a
confession
of
error
is
filed,
which
has
not
been
filed
formally
in
this
case,
that
does
not
remove
the
case
from
the
court's
jurisdiction.
it
still
on
occasions,
there
are
precedence
for
either
the
court
appointing
an
amicus
or
the
solicitor
general
presenting
the
side
of
the
case
with
which
he
disagrees.
mr.
harris
weinstein
and
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
that
is
correct,
justice
white.
mr.
harris
weinstein
that
is
the
view
of
that
is
expressed
in
that
part
of
the
brief.
mr.
harris
weinstein
and
it's
our
view
that
i
wish
to
support
here.
mr.
harris
weinstein
no
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
--
that
is
in
complete
disagreement
with
the
court
of
appeals
and
in
agreement
with
the
appellants
with
the
position
taken
by
the
state
of
connecticut.
mr.
harris
weinstein
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
ruled
in
favor
or
the
servicemen.
the
district
court
ruled
in
favor
of
the
servicemen.
mr.
harris
weinstein
the
position
taken
in
the
part
2
of
our
brief
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
--
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
and
district
court
were
wrong
and
should
be
reversed.
mr.
harris
weinstein
that
is
not
the
position
that
i
have
been
assigned
to
argue
here.
i
have
been
assigned
to
present
in
an
adversarial
fashion,
if
i
may,
the
other
side
of
the
case
which
is
developing
forthwith.
mr.
harris
weinstein
that's
correct.
but
i
think
that
the
conclusion
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
would
like
to
be
free
to
argue
if
i
may
that
the
decision
below
should
be
affirmed
and
present
what
we
conceive
of
as
the
arguments
on
that
side
of
the
case.
mr.
harris
weinstein
my
--
myself
and
the
other
gentlemen
who
were
assigned
to
work
on
this
part
of
the
case,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
harris
weinstein
the
solicitor
general's
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
--
i
don't
--
i
would
like
to
think
mr.
chief
justice
that
that
is
not
pertinent
that
the
--
pertinent
thing
is
that
in
view
of
the
solicitor
general,
this
issue
should
be
developed
before
the
call
of
court
in
argument
in
an
adversarial
way.
mr.
harris
weinstein
if
i
may?
mr.
harris
weinstein
that
is
not,
no
that
is
not
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
because
the
constitutionality
question
is
the
other
way
around,
mr.
chief
justice.
and
the
basic
issue
is
as
it
is
been
argued
below
and
as
i
would
conceive
it
as
not
one
of
constitutional
law,
but
of
interpretation
of
a
specific
part
of
the
soldiers'
and
sailors'
civil
relief
act.
the
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes
of
course,
but
my
difference
with
you
wasn't
to
the
extent
the
connecticut
and
the
solicitor
general
agree
that
the
decision
should
be
reversed.
the
difficulty
i
had
with
your
formulation
is
your
statement
of
who
wants
the
statute
to
be
held
constitutional.
the
position
of
connecticut
is
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional.
the
position
of
the
solicitor
general
has
not
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
is
that
section
514
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
--
is
an
unconstitutional
abridgement
of
the
reserved
powers
of
the
state
to
tax.
mr.
harris
weinstein
that's
correct.
mr.
harris
weinstein
no,
no.
and
there
is
no
question
here
of
a
constitutionality
of
the
state
tax
act.
the
question
is
whether
that
act
may
be
enforced
against
soldiers
and
sailors
in
view
of
section
514
of
the
civil
relief
act.
and
the
solicitor
general
does
not
take,
as
i
understand
it,
the
position
on
the
constitutionality
of
soldiers'
and
sailors'
civil
relief
act.
his
--
the
argument
in
part
2
of
the
government's
brief
goes
to
the
proper
interpretation
of
the
civil
relief
act.
and
it
is
there
that
i
think
that
the
solicitor
general
expresses
in
disagreement
with
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes,
well
i
also
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
telye
case
which
was
i
think
decided
at
the
same
term.
where
the
department
--
this
was
also
a
tax
case
where
the
department
of
justice
disagree
with
the
commission
of
internal
revenue,
and
mr.
leven
from
the
solicitor
general
office
sought
to
present
both
office.
my
hope
here
is
to
present
only
the
one
side.
the
one
side
that
is
not
been
presented
by
mr.
ahern.
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
think
mr.
chief
justice
that
the
position
of
the
united
states
before
this
court
must
be
taken
to
be
that
formulated
by
the
solicitor
general.
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
would
think
so,
yes
sir.
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
did
not
think
that
i
had
suggested
that
i
would
be
speaking
for
the
government
in
presenting
these
views.
as
i
indicated
before,
i
was
assigned
to
come
here
not
because
the
solicitor
general
thinks
that
what
i'm
going
to
say
is
right,
but
because
of
his
view
that
this
case
should
have
adversaries
on
each
side
of
them.
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
--
perhaps
mr.
chief
justice
with
hindsight,
we
should've
had
identified
the
names
differently.
i
think
the
belief
was
that
in
the
introduction
of
part
2
of
our
brief
there
was
no
means
--
it
was
on
page
37,
the
statement
was
“the
foregoing
arguments
has
been
prepared
by
officers
of
the
department
of
justice
who
support
it”,
meaning
the
officers
of
the
department
of
justice
who
felt
that
they
could
formulate
those
arguments
and
support
them
without
any
reservation.
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes,
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
harris
weinstein
without
lieutenant
schuman
as
a
party,
i
question
that.
we
prefer
to
handle
this
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes,
sir.
mr.
harris
weinstein
well,
i
understand
your
concern
justice
fortas.
i
--
perhaps
it
ought
to
be
made
clear
that
as
i
understand
it,
my
assignment
is
to
present
that
side.
and
in
terms
of
one
being
subordinate,
i
do
not
think
that
or
do
not
concede
that
i
would
have
any
difficulty,
except
if
i
fail
to
present
the
servicemen
side
as
well
as
i
could.
mr.
harris
weinstein
who
assigned
me?
mr.
harris
weinstein
the
solicitor
general,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes,
sir.
mr.
harris
weinstein
he
knew
that
i
was
going
to
take
the
servicemen
side.
he
was
fully
aware
of
it.
mr.
harris
weinstein
the
authority
which
is
in
statute
and
in
regulations
is
the
authority
i
suppose
of
the
solicitor
general
to
assign
attorneys
in
the
employee
of
the
government
to
appear
in
this
court
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
--
on
cases
in
which
the
government
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
can't
answer
that
question
directly
justice
black.
i
don't
know
if
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
can't
answer
at
this
point
whether
there's
a
specific
statutory
possession.
mr.
harris
weinstein
by
the
united
states.
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes.
now,
i
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
think
the
best
discussion
of
our
authority
is
in
the
fourth
circuit
decision
in
united
states
v.
arlington
county,
which
is
in
326
f.2d,
and
i
think
that
the
discussion
of
the
united
states
standing
in
the
suit
of
this
nature
is
set
forth
there.
mr.
harris
weinstein
in
that
particular
case?
mr.
harris
weinstein
that
particular
case
involved
the
application
of
virginia
ad
valorem
taxation.
and
the
position
of
the
united
states
there
was
that
that
taxation
should
not
be
imposed
and
could
not
be
imposed
under
section
514.
mr.
harris
weinstein
that
we
have
proper
standing
as
representatives
of
the
servicemen
to
appear
and
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
my
recollection
is
that
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
my
recollection
is
the
latter
justice
white,
but
i
might
be
wrong.
mr.
harris
weinstein
not
as
a
party
mr.
chief
justice.
he
was
dismissed
for
inability
to
have
the
jurisdictional
amount
in
a
class
action.
i
see
that
my
time
has
expired,
almost
expired
and
i
have
yet
to
reach
any
discussion
of
the
merits.
and
if
the
court
pleases,
i
should
like
to
proceed
on
the
merits.
mr.
harris
weinstein
to
continue
with
them.
and
if
i
may,
i
--
if
the
court
would
hear
me
beyond
my
half
hour
because
i
can't
believe
that
in
the
next
five
minutes
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
would
do
my
best
in
that
limited
time
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
that
the
--
i'd
like
to
turn
first
if
i
may
to
the
discussion
of
commander
foster's
case
by
mr.
ahern,
because
i
think
that
what
happened
to
commander
foster
may
best
illustrate
why
section
514
was
adopted
and
why
the
courts
below
were
correct.
commander
foster
bought
a
car
in
connecticut.
he
lived
--
he
was
a
domiciliary
of
texas.
he
wanted
to
register
his
car
in
texas.
he
wrote
to
texas
and
he
was
told
that
to
register
there,
he
had
to
pay
a
texas
sales
tax.
the
dealer
in
connecticut
told
him
he
nevertheless
had
to
pay
a
connecticut
tax
to
get
his
car.
his
affidavit
states
that
he
called
the
department
of
motor
vehicles
in
connecticut,
and
was
told
that
there
was
no
credit.
he
had
to
pay
what,
he
says,
was
--
he
was
told
to
the
--
a
connecticut
use
tax.
to
get
his
car
and
to
register
it
in
his
home
state
in
texas,
he
paid
the
texas
tax
and
both
connecticut
tax.
and
it
isn't
until
this
court
in
mr.
ahern's
argument
here
that
he
has
been
told
that
he
didn't
have
to
pay
both
taxes.
now,
we
suggest
that
section
514
was
intended
to
avoid
this
kind
of
situation.
that
it
was
intended
to
create
a
situation
where
the
only
jurisdiction
which
could
tax
servicemen
in
this
position
would
be
his
home
state.
514
was
added
to
the
soldiers'
and
sailors'
civil
relief
act
in
1942.
it
was
--
the
language
that
we
are
interested
in
here
was
added
in
1944.
i
would
suggest
the
basic
problem
is
whether
the
language
or
the
policy
or
the
basis
for
this
--
of
the
statute
in
any
way
allow
a
distinction
to
be
drawn
between
ad
valorem
taxation,
annual
ad
valorem
taxation,
which
everybody
agrees
is
forbidden
by
the
statute
and
sales
and
use
tax.
the
starting
place,
i
would
suggest,
should
be
the
language
of
the
statute.
it
refers
in
its
terms
to
what
is
called
“taxation
in
respect
of
personal
property”.
now
this
is
what
seemed
to
be
the
broadest
possible
language.
it
is
not
ad
valorem
taxation.
it
is
not
seemingly
restricted
to
anyone's
specific
type
of
taxation,
but
taxation
in
respect
to
personal
property.
this
would
seem
to
catch
any
tax
that
has
to
do
with
personal
property
that
depends
or
is
triggered
by
the
existence
of
personal
property.
and
any
such
tax
under
section
514
is
supposed
to
be
forbidden
except
when
imposed
or
exacted
by
the
servicemen
state
of
residence
or
domicile.
in
the
way
that
the
--
this
mechanism
works
is
to
create
what
might
be
called
a
fictional
location
of
the
servicemen's
personal
property.
the
personal
property
is
deemed
not
to
be
in
any
state
where
he
appears
and
is
not
a
resident
or
a
domiciliary,
and
any
state
where
he's
taken
solely
by
his
military
orders.
i
don't
think
that
anyone
has
suggested
exactly
how
this
phrase
can
be
read
in
a
way
that
would
set
--
describe
only
ad
valorem
taxes,
but
would
not
describe
sales
or
use
taxes.
i
think
this
is
particularly
clear
with
use
taxes.
use
taxes
require
the
physical
presence
of
property
within
a
taxing
jurisdiction.
it
can
be
imposed
only
when
property
is
used
in
the
jurisdiction.
and
that
occurs
--
that
can
not
occur
in
the
case
of
a
nonresident
serviceman
because
of
section
514.
his
property
can
never
be
deemed
to
be
in
a
jurisdiction
other
than
his
home
state
for
purposes
of
local
taxation.
this
is
also
true
i
think,
of
sales
taxes
and
if
connecticut
statute,
which
i
think
is
typical,
it
doesn't
just
as
they
say
tax
the
privilege
of
a
sale.
it
--
the
tax
comes
into
being
only
when
there
is
a
sale
of
personal
property.
personal
and
furthermore,
it
only
happens
when
the
possession
of
this
personal
property
is
taken
in
connecticut.
under
section
514
that
possession
is
got
to
be
considered
as
taking
place
in
the
serviceman's
home
state.
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes,
mr.
justice
black.
in
our
brief
at
pages
2
to
4
and
also
in
connecticut's
brief,
i
think
in
the
appendix.
i'm
not
--
and
the
particular
language
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
the
brief?
mr.
harris
weinstein
within
the
last
three
weeks,
i
believe.
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes,
sir.
and
the
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
but
the
language
of
the
statute
is
this,
mr.
justice
black.
a
person
--
a
personal
property,
meaning
personal
property
of
the
nonresident
serviceman
shall
not
be
deemed
to
be
located
or
present
in
or
to
have
a
situs
for
taxation
in
such
state
and
so
forth.
the
situs
for
taxation
of
a
serviceman's
personal
property
is
deemed
to
be
his
home
state
and
not
the
state
where
he
goes
on
military
orders,
so
that
the
language
and
the
mechanism
of
the
statute
don't
seem
to
allow
any
distinction
between
these
types
of
taxes.
i
would
suggest
the
same
thing
is
true
of
the
policies
of
this
statute.
this
purpose
of
the
statute
as
expressed
by
congress
and
by
this
court
was
to
avoid
any
real
threat,
any
possibility
of
double
taxation
by
multiple
jurisdictions.
and
it
was
to
achieve
this
not
by
some
manner
of
trying
to
find
out
which
state
you
grant
to
credit
for
the
other
state,
which
is
the
kind
of
thing
that
has
happened
in
commander
foster's
case
and
is
never
then
really
resolved.
rather,
the
purpose
of
the
statute
was
to
leave
the
sole
function
of
the
tax,
the
sole
ability
to
tax
to
the
home
state,
to
the
serviceman's
residence
or
domicile.
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
think
justice
harlan
the
risk
of
double
taxation
comes
out
of
a
complimentary
function
of
the
sales
and
use
taxations.
as
the
two
courts
below
said,
they're
not
really
separate
taxes,
they're
merged
into
one.
the
use
taxes
in
so
much
as
a
matter
of
raising
revenue
by
itself,
but
it's
a
complement
in
a
means
of
enforcing
the
sales
tax.
and
i
would
suggest
that
this
is
double
taxation
when
a
sale
--
serviceman
buys
a
car
in
one
state
and
is
charged
a
sales
tax
and
he
goes
to
the
other
--
another
state
where
he
is
then
charged
a
use
tax,
which
use
tax
would
not
have
been
imposed
if
he
had
originally
bought
the
car
in
the
second
state
and
paid
a
sales
tax.
mr.
harris
weinstein
in
one
of
two
situations.
if
as
commander
foster
tried
to
do,
the
serviceman
seeks
to
register
his
car
in
his
home
state,
generally
the
home
state
will
seek
to
impose
a
tax.
the
other
thing
which
comes
to
the
potential
of
double
taxation
which
is
also
within
the
purposes
of
this
statute
is
that
ultimately,
we
would
--
i'd
assume
the
serviceman
is
going
home.
and
when
he
goes
home
he
brings
back
his
property
with
him
whatever
he's
acquired.
and
at
that
time,
he
is
going
to
be
subjected
to
a
use
tax
on
this
property.
and
this
is
the
point
in
time
when
double
taxation
is
almost
certain.
i
suggest
really
in
terms
of
potential
for
double
taxation,
this
ought
to
be
compared
to
the
structure
of
the
ad
valorem
taxation.
ad
valorem
taxation
isn't
going
to
be
doubly
imposed
anymore
frequently
than
the
use
tax
or
in
sales
tax
structures.
it
would
really
depend
on
the
accident
of
a
man
being
switched
from
jurisdiction
to
jurisdiction
within
one
year
being
in
one
state
on
its
ad
valorem
tax
day,
and
then
in
another
state
later
in
the
year
or
earlier
on
its
ad
valorem
tax
day.
mr.
harris
weinstein
that's
right.
mr.
harris
weinstein
that's
right.
sales
tax
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
that
is
our
position.
i
think
that
the
other
side
argues
that
the
phrase,
the
initial
phrase
of
the
statute
for
the
purposes
of
taxation
in
respect
to
personal
property
means
only
ad
valorem
taxation
in
respect
personal
property.
it
doesn't
catch
any
other
tax.
and
i
see
that
my
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
in
speaking
of
personal
property,
justice
fortas,
i
think
there
are
two
potential
bases
for
imposing
a
tax,
and
they're
dealt
within
two
separate
sentences
here.
one
is
a
tax
that
proceeds
on
residence
or
domicile
on
taxes
personal
property.
mr.
harris
weinstein
no.
mr.
harris
weinstein
no,
and
that
is
the
first
sentence
justice
fortas.
mr.
harris
weinstein
now,
the
sentence
that
begins
on
the
top
of
page
3
in
the
middle
of
the
first
line
which
again
begins
for
the
purposes
of
taxation
in
respect
of,
it
doesn't
say
person
now,
but
personal
property,
income
or
gross
income.
first,
it
defines
the
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
of
any
such
person.
now
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes,
and
that
would
be
i
think
a
reference
to
the
“any
person”
in
the
first
sentence
perhaps
modified,
and
i
suppose
modified
by
the
language
--
person
being
absent
there
from,
from
his
home
state
in
compliance
with
military
or
naval
orders
in
the
first
sentence.
and
then
as
you
go
one
in
this
sentence,
first
it
describes
a
source
of
income
and
says
military
pay
shall
not
be
deemed
to
be
from
within
the
home
state.
and
then
for
present
purposes,
the
language
is
personal
property
shall
not
be
deemed
to
be
located
or
present
in
or
to
have
a
situs
for
taxation
in
such
state
territory
possession
or
political
division
or
district.
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
think
that
that
--
whether
that
is
so
depends
on
how
the
sales
and
use
tax
statutes
work.
now,
use
tax
statutes
are
applied
only
when
property
is
within
and
used
within
the
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes,
but
the
sales
tax
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes,
but
the
sales
tax
also
depends
on
physical
presence
of
the
property
in
the
taxing
jurisdiction.
under
the
connecticut
statute
and
while
the
language
is
different
in
other
states,
the
effect
is
the
same.
the
tax
is
imposed
only
when
there
is
a
sale
and
when
physical
possession
is
taken
in
the
taxing
jurisdiction.
mr.
harris
weinstein
this
is
the
same
kind
of
tax
that
was
before
the
court
last
term
in
the
massachusetts
bank
case
and
it's
a
vendee
tax.
the
legal
incidence
is
on
the
buyer.
the
seller
is
given
an
action
in
debt
to
collect
--
and
is
directed
to
pass
the
tax
on
to
the
buyer.
and
it's
clearly
a
vendee
tax.
mr.
harris
weinstein
the
seller
is
liable
to
the
state.
the
buyer
is
liable
to
the
seller.
and
it's
the
same
structure
as
this
court
labeled
a
vendee
tax
last
term.
mr.
harris
weinstein
well
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
it's
imposed
on
the
sale
of
tangible
personal
property.
so
that
it
purports
to
be
on
the
sale,
but
it's
not
just
the
sale
alone.
there
must
be
tangible
personal
property.
and
the
word
sale
and
selling
are
defined
in
the
statute,
in
the
connecticut
statute
in
words
that
are
quoted
in
pages
28
and
29
of
the
brief
here.
and
it
says
mean
and
include
any
transfer
of
title,
exchange
or
barter
and
so
forth.
now,
transfer
of
title
under
the
general
rule
of
the
uniform
commercial
code
which
applies
in
connecticut
and
i
think
almost
all
states
by
now
is
the
title
is
transferred
when
the
seller's
responsibility
is
asked
to
delivery
or
complete
it,
so
that
this
definition
of
sale
incorporates
a
concept
of
a
transfer
of
physical
possession
so
that
you
can't
view
the
sale
tax
as
simply
being
on
some
abstract
privilege
of
selling.
mr.
harris
weinstein
well,
if
there
is
no
transfer
of
possession,
if
the
property
is
supposed
to
stay
a
word
as
this
brings
in
to
play
a
different
part
of
the
uniform
commercial
code
which
would
transfer
title
at
that
earlier
time.
but
i
think
where
we're
talking
here
about
movable
chattels,
boats,
cars,
appliances,
things
of
that
sort,
there
are
things
that
contemplate
transfer.
mr.
harris
weinstein
food
and
drink
under
the
stipulation,
i
think
would
--
the
stipulation
says
that
everyday
purchases
are
made
in
the
post-exchange
or
commissary.
and
those
under
the
buck
act
which
is
i
think
section
107
of
title
4
are
explicitly
exempt
from
sales
and
use
tax.
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
didn't
understand
that
to
be
in
the
stipulation.
i
just
understood
that
that
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
well,
if
i
can
avoid
the
cigarette
tax
which
is
different
state
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
i'll
take
the
sales
tax
on
it.
mr.
harris
weinstein
such
say
a
tube
of
toothpaste
which
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
think
the
position
on
this
side
of
the
case
would
be
that
the
exemption
applies
simply
because
there
is
no
way
of
parsing
neither
section
514
or
the
connecticut
tax
to
apply
to
only
to
say
big
ticket
items
and
not
to
small
purchase.
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes,
i
think
the
impact.
i'm
saying
that
that's
the
thrust
of
the
legislative
judgment
in
this
statute.
the
function
of
the
stipulation
i
think
is
to
show
that
that
kind
of
impact
is
not
likely
to
exist
because
purchases
of
this
kind
are
not
made
in
stores
that
are
generally
subject
to
that
type
of
--
to
the
state
tax
but
are
made
in
official
installations
where
the
tax
doesn't
apply.
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes,
i
think
whether
that
would
fall
under
section
514.
mr.
harris
weinstein
i'd
like
to
start
by
saying
i
don't
think
that's
in
this
case.
at
least
it
has
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
well,
i
think
i've
struggle
with
the
problem
of
how
do
you
characterize
the
right
to
occupy
a
motel
or
hotel
room
for
a
night.
and
under
section
514
the
problem
comes
down
to
whether
you
can
characterize
this
right
as
an
intangible
personal
property.
if
it
is,
it
would
be
exempt.
i
suspect
it
isn't.
it
seems
to
more
in
the
nature
of
a
real
property
interest
which
would
not
be
caught.
but
whether
that
comes
under
section
514
is
a
rather
different
problem
than
these
admittedly
tangible
items
which
have
physical
location
that
do
move
around,
where
a
hotel
room
doesn't
and
certainly
seem
to
be
the
type
of
objects
that
section
514
was
intended
to
deal
with.
now,
there
are
other
points
that
i
think
are
adequately
covered
in
part
1
of
the
brief
which
is
the
discussion
of
the
buck
act,
the
supposed
administrative
problems
and
the
constitutional
attack
which
i
think
this
court
put
to
rest
in
the
case
of
dameron
against
brodhead
some
years
ago.
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
would
think
that
the
existence
of
the
controversy
--
again
i
would
like
to
go
back
to
the
confession
situation,
because
in
the
confession
situation
the
government
is
clearly
saying
now,
we
don't
think
now
that
in
a
criminal
case
this
man
could've
been
prosecuted
or
should've
been
prosecuted
in
this
way.
mr.
harris
weinstein
the
very
least
there
is
here
is
a
controversy
between
the
servicemen
and
the
state,
which
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
the
difficulty
i
have
is
in
distinguishing
between
this
case
as
i
said
and
i
guess
i'm
not
adding
anything
new
to
what
i've
said
in
any
instance
of
confession
of
error.
i
think
that
the
--
what
you're
saying
would
lead
to
the
route
that
if
there
is
a
confession
of
error
that
would
moot
the
controversy,
certainly
if
the
confession
went
to
the
propriety
of
the
charge
say
that
was
brought
as
opposed
to
some
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
if
this
were
the
district
court
or
court
of
appeals
after
last
wednesday,
i'd
have
to
agree
with
that
because
i
think
it
was
last
wednesday
that
decided
the
case.
and
i
don't
think
it
was
a
prediction
of
that
outcome
that
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
well
he
was
just
--
you
mean
why
did
he
not
appeal?
mr.
harris
weinstein
he
was
this
--
are
you
taking
about
the
arlington
county
case?
mr.
harris
weinstein
i'm
sorry
i
was
confused.
mr.
harris
weinstein
i'm
not
certain
about
it,
but
i
assume
its
reason
similar
to
this
case
where
one
man
would
not
ordinarily
have
$10,000.00
jurisdiction
alone.
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes,
but
if
i
can
just
try
once
more
on
this
analogy.
suppose
a
criminal
charge
is
brought
and
the
claim
of
the
defendant
is
that
this
charge
is
barred
by
the
constitution
and
this
is
the
matter
in
which
the
case
is
litigated.
and
in
this
court
there
is
a
confession
of
error
to
it
a
statement
that
it
is
then
the
position
of
the
united
states
that
this
charge
is
indeed
unconstitutional.
now,
i
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
would
think
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
perhaps
this
would
--
it
seems
to
me
that
the
united
states
which
clearly
has
a
function
as
a
guardian
for
certain
purposes
of
servicemen,
in
that
capacity
would
have
a
capacity
that
is
different
and
distinct
from
its
position
as
its
general
position
as
sovereign.
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes,
but
i
think
it
is
part
of
that
because
the
servicemen's
interest
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
think
that
you
--
it's
hard
to
know
what
would
have
done.
for
example,
it
would
be
entirely
possible
for
the
department
of
justice
to
appear
on
behalf
of
the
other
side
of
the
case.
now
perhaps
then
it
would
have
been
brought
in
a
state
court
rather
than
the
federal
court.
now,
i
think
--
i
would
suggest
the
district
court
and
court
of
appeals
jurisdiction
has
to
be
viewed
in
terms
of
what
the
situation
was
at
that
time.
this
court
is
---
would
have
jurisdiction
certainly
of
this
case
and
it
came
up
through
the
state
system,
and
if
you
were
to
argue
that
the
case
or
controversy
has
disappeared
as
between
the
united
states,
i
think
in
terms
of
this
court's
jurisdiction,
it
still
has
to
be
considered
in
terms
of
the
existence
a
capacity
on
the
united
states
to
appear
as
the
representative,
as
the
guardian
of
the
servicemen.
mr.
harris
weinstein
but
that
an
issue
which
would
depend
on
something
that
developed
after
the
decision
in
the
district
court
and
court
of
appeals.
mr.
harris
weinstein
well
as
i
--
it
is
--
as
i
said
it
is
uncommon.
as
i
said
earlier,
i
do
not
think
it
is
unprecedented.
and
it
occurs
to
me
now
that
there
is
a
case
that
i
might
have
cited
that
would
be
somewhat
better
for
this
purpose
than
the
kornhauser
case,
and
perhaps
i
should've
cited
it
first.
and
i
think
this
is
burnet
against
northern
trust
company.
again
a
tax
case,
i
believe
from
the
1930's
and
i
--
it
may
be
in
283
united
states
reports,
i'm
not
certain.
but
this
is
a
situation
where
the
brief
had
one
half
prepared
--
one
part
prepared
by
the
revenue,
by
the
treasury
department
and
the
other
half
by
the
department
of
justice.
and
the
treasury
appeared
to
present
its
case,
although
the
controversy
is
as
much
there
between
the
government
and
the
taxpayer.
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
suppose
the
case
would
be
--
had
been
closer
to
the
northern
trust
if
this
case
had
been
brought
in
the
name
of
the
secretary
of
defense
as
the
northern
trust
case
was
brought
against
the
collector
of
internal
revenue.
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
did
not
in
--
i
hope
i
didn't
characterize
my
function
in
that
way.
i
tried
to
put
it
in
terms
of
the
being
assigned
to
come
here
for
an
adversarial
presentation.
mr.
harris
weinstein
no,
i
cannot
say
i
did.
mr.
harris
weinstein
well,
i
think
i'll
cite
what
i
can
offer
on
this
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
harris
weinstein
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
united
states
instituted
this
action
as
a
plaintiff
in
furtherance
of
the
interest
of
the
servicemen
and
the
interest
of
the
united
states
in
having
whatever
rights
are
accorded
by
the
soldiers'
and
sailors'
civil
relief
act
implemented
for
members
of
the
armed
forces.
since
mister
--
lieutenant
schuman
was
dismissed,
and
the
grounds
for
his
dismissal
were
essentially
the
grounds
this
court
announced
last
week
in
the
decisions
of
schneider
against
harris
and
gas
service
company
against
coburn
for
lack
of
jurisdictional
amount
and
class
action.
united
states
is
the
remaining
party
of
the
on
the
plaintiff
side
of
the
case.my
purpose
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
was
about
to
say
mr.
justice
stewart,
my
purpose
here
is
to
advance
the
arguments
and
support
the
argument
set
forth
in
part
1
of
our
brief,
the
argument
in
behalf
of
the
servicemen.
as
part
2
of
the
brief
indicates
the
solicitor
general
and
the
assistant
attorney
general
in
charge
of
the
tax
division
cannot
subscribe
to
those
arguments
in
review
of
the
decision
below
should
not
be
sustained.
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
think
mr.
justice
brennan
that
the
--
well
i
should
--
the
way
to
put
it
is
that
we
are
here
for
all
practical
purposes
as
the
representative
as
in
effect
as
the
guardian
out
of
light
of
the
servicemen.
this
is
how
the
suit
was
brought.
these
are
the
arguments
put
forth
in
part
1
and
these
are
the
arguments
i
proposed
to
advance
here.
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
think
this
is
a
situation
where
the
government
has
whereas
perhaps
more
than
one
hat
to
the
extent
that
the
government's
function
is
to
formulate
a
litigating
position
on
behalf
of
the
department
of
justice,
which
represents
the
united
states
as
such.
that
of
course
is
formulated
by
the
solicitor
general
taking
of
course
the
counsel,
the
assistant
attorney
general.
and
--
but
i
do
not
think
that
this
is
viewed
as
a
case
where
the
primary
function
is
to
advance
a
position
of
the
united
states
as
such.
and
as
for
that
reason
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes,
i
think
that
it's
the
--
clearly
the
function
of
the
solicitor
general
to
formulate
what
you're
describing
as
the
official
position
in
this
court.
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes,
i
would.
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
think
that's
right.
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
think
the
two
views
are
the
judgment
below
should
be
affirmed,
which
i
should
like
to
advance
here.
and
the
other
view
is
that
the
judgment
below
should
be
reversed.
mr.
harris
weinstein
no.
i
think
that
reliance
is
placed
on
mr.
ahern
to
advance
that
position.
and
i
think
that
part
2
of
our
brief
indicates
that
is
not
intended
as
a
complete
development
to
those
views,
but
rather
summary
of
them
in
principal
reliance
is
placed
on
the
briefs
of
the
appellants
and
of
the
amici
curiae
on
their
side
of
the
case.
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
think
there
is
justice
white,
because
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
if
you
check
the
purest
case
justice
white,
and
if
i
were
not
here
to
advance
the
argument
on
behalf
of
the
servicemen.
let's
assume
for
the
moment
the
situation
where
the
government
simply
confesses
error
in
the
prosecution.
i
don't
think
that
that's
ever
been
considered
to
deprive
a
court
of
jurisdiction
to
decide
the
issue.
i
don't
think
that
that's
ever
been
thought
to
remove
the
basis
for
this
court
decision.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
in
where
we
sue
on
behalf
of
servicemen
in
that
representative
capacity
is
a
very
real
controversy.
the
controversy
is
between
the
services
and
the
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
think
that
would
go
far
as
a
speculation.
i
don't
know
yet.
i
can't
answer
to
that.
mr.
harris
weinstein
no.
i
don't
know.
the
brief
does
not
suggest
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
am
here
hoping
that
i'll
be
able
to
argue
the
other
side
on
behalf
of
the
servicemen.
mr.
harris
weinstein
of
the
solicitor
general.
mr.
harris
weinstein
you
mean
what
is
my
personal
opinion
on
the
matter?
mr.
harris
weinstein
well,
i
think
to
the
extent
that
my
personal
view
is
a
pertinent
and
i'm
not
sure
that
they
are,
i
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
--
i
support
your
arguments,
i'd
like
to
advance.
mr.
harris
weinstein
it's
unconventional
justice
fortas,
but
i
don't
think
unprecedented.
although,
i
would
concede
the
precedence
are
not
common.
the
one
that
has
occurred
to
me
is
the
closest
example
of
this
procedure
might
be
a
tax
case
called
kornhauser,
which
is
recorded
in
276
of
the
united
states
reports.
and
i
believe
that
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
volume
276.
as
i
say,
it's
not
unprecedented
but
hardly
common.
and
i
believe
that
if
the
court
examines
the
briefs
there,
the
court
will
find
a
comparable
kind
of
situation.
the
distinction
and
the
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
don't
think
that
there
is
a
conflict
among
--
in
the
department
of
justice
in
the
sense
that
the
officials
charged
with
the
responsibility
of
formulating
a
position
of
the
presidential
appointees
over
an
agreement,
and
their
views
are
stated
in
part
2
of
the
brief.
in
the
kornhauser
case,
i
said
the
situation
was
similar
in
this
way.
the
disagreement
was
between
the
department
of
justice
and
what
i
think
was
then
called
the
bureau
of
internal
revenue
and
the
department
of
the
treasury.
and
there
was
brief
filed
in
two
parts.
as
i
recall
it,
it
was
an
appeal
from
the
court
of
claims
involving
the
question
of
deductibility
for
income
tax
purposes
and
some
legal
fees.
and
the
court
of
claims,
as
i
recall
it,
it
allowed
the
deduction.
the
--
i'm
sorry,
had
disallowed
the
deduction.
the
treasury
thought
that
was
the
correct
view.
there
was
part
--
first
a
part
of
the
briefs
supporting
that
position
urging
affirmance.
and
the
case
was
argued,
as
i
recall
on
that,
i
beg
your
pardon,
it
was
submitted.
it
was
not
argued,
but
it
was
a
separate
part
of
that
nature
in
the
second
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
no.
but
i
think
that
you
have
a
position
of
the
united
states
in
its
capacity
as
representative
of
the
servicemen.
mr.
harris
weinstein
mr.
chief
justice,
i
don't
think
that
the
solicitor
general
assigned
me
to
appear
here
with
that
purpose
in
mind.
as
i
understand
my
assignment,
it
precedes
from
the
solicitor
general's
view
that
this
case
should
receive
a
--
an
adversarial
presentation.
and
that
the
court
should
have
before
an
adversarial
development
of
the
arguments
on
both
sides,
and
as
for
that
purpose
that
the
solicitor
general
has
assigned
me
to
come
here
and
to
present
the
arguments
on
behalf
of
the
servicemen.
and
it
is
not
that
it
is
a
matter
of
a
deputy
attempting
to
override
him.
it's
a
matter
of
having
been
assigned
to
appear
as
an
attorney
presenting
this
side
of
the
case.
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
should
think
so.
i
should
think
it's
comparable
as
i
said
before
to
perhaps
a
step
behind,
but
comparable
to
a
situation
of
a
confession
of
error.
when
you
ask
me,
mr.
justice
white,
is
there
a
case
of
controversy?
if
a
confession
of
error
is
filed,
which
has
not
been
filed
formally
in
this
case,
that
does
not
remove
the
case
from
the
court's
jurisdiction.
it
still
on
occasions,
there
are
precedence
for
either
the
court
appointing
an
amicus
or
the
solicitor
general
presenting
the
side
of
the
case
with
which
he
disagrees.
mr.
harris
weinstein
and
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
that
is
correct,
justice
white.
mr.
harris
weinstein
that
is
the
view
of
that
is
expressed
in
that
part
of
the
brief.
mr.
harris
weinstein
and
it's
our
view
that
i
wish
to
support
here.
mr.
harris
weinstein
no
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
--
that
is
in
complete
disagreement
with
the
court
of
appeals
and
in
agreement
with
the
appellants
with
the
position
taken
by
the
state
of
connecticut.
mr.
harris
weinstein
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
ruled
in
favor
or
the
servicemen.
the
district
court
ruled
in
favor
of
the
servicemen.
mr.
harris
weinstein
the
position
taken
in
the
part
2
of
our
brief
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
--
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
and
district
court
were
wrong
and
should
be
reversed.
mr.
harris
weinstein
that
is
not
the
position
that
i
have
been
assigned
to
argue
here.
i
have
been
assigned
to
present
in
an
adversarial
fashion,
if
i
may,
the
other
side
of
the
case
which
is
developing
forthwith.
mr.
harris
weinstein
that's
correct.
but
i
think
that
the
conclusion
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
would
like
to
be
free
to
argue
if
i
may
that
the
decision
below
should
be
affirmed
and
present
what
we
conceive
of
as
the
arguments
on
that
side
of
the
case.
mr.
harris
weinstein
my
--
myself
and
the
other
gentlemen
who
were
assigned
to
work
on
this
part
of
the
case,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
harris
weinstein
the
solicitor
general's
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
--
i
don't
--
i
would
like
to
think
mr.
chief
justice
that
that
is
not
pertinent
that
the
--
pertinent
thing
is
that
in
view
of
the
solicitor
general,
this
issue
should
be
developed
before
the
call
of
court
in
argument
in
an
adversarial
way.
mr.
harris
weinstein
if
i
may?
mr.
harris
weinstein
that
is
not,
no
that
is
not
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
because
the
constitutionality
question
is
the
other
way
around,
mr.
chief
justice.
and
the
basic
issue
is
as
it
is
been
argued
below
and
as
i
would
conceive
it
as
not
one
of
constitutional
law,
but
of
interpretation
of
a
specific
part
of
the
soldiers'
and
sailors'
civil
relief
act.
the
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes
of
course,
but
my
difference
with
you
wasn't
to
the
extent
the
connecticut
and
the
solicitor
general
agree
that
the
decision
should
be
reversed.
the
difficulty
i
had
with
your
formulation
is
your
statement
of
who
wants
the
statute
to
be
held
constitutional.
the
position
of
connecticut
is
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional.
the
position
of
the
solicitor
general
has
not
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
is
that
section
514
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
--
is
an
unconstitutional
abridgement
of
the
reserved
powers
of
the
state
to
tax.
mr.
harris
weinstein
that's
correct.
mr.
harris
weinstein
no,
no.
and
there
is
no
question
here
of
a
constitutionality
of
the
state
tax
act.
the
question
is
whether
that
act
may
be
enforced
against
soldiers
and
sailors
in
view
of
section
514
of
the
civil
relief
act.
and
the
solicitor
general
does
not
take,
as
i
understand
it,
the
position
on
the
constitutionality
of
soldiers'
and
sailors'
civil
relief
act.
his
--
the
argument
in
part
2
of
the
government's
brief
goes
to
the
proper
interpretation
of
the
civil
relief
act.
and
it
is
there
that
i
think
that
the
solicitor
general
expresses
in
disagreement
with
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes,
well
i
also
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
telye
case
which
was
i
think
decided
at
the
same
term.
where
the
department
--
this
was
also
a
tax
case
where
the
department
of
justice
disagree
with
the
commission
of
internal
revenue,
and
mr.
leven
from
the
solicitor
general
office
sought
to
present
both
office.
my
hope
here
is
to
present
only
the
one
side.
the
one
side
that
is
not
been
presented
by
mr.
ahern.
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
think
mr.
chief
justice
that
the
position
of
the
united
states
before
this
court
must
be
taken
to
be
that
formulated
by
the
solicitor
general.
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
would
think
so,
yes
sir.
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
did
not
think
that
i
had
suggested
that
i
would
be
speaking
for
the
government
in
presenting
these
views.
as
i
indicated
before,
i
was
assigned
to
come
here
not
because
the
solicitor
general
thinks
that
what
i'm
going
to
say
is
right,
but
because
of
his
view
that
this
case
should
have
adversaries
on
each
side
of
them.
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
--
perhaps
mr.
chief
justice
with
hindsight,
we
should've
had
identified
the
names
differently.
i
think
the
belief
was
that
in
the
introduction
of
part
2
of
our
brief
there
was
no
means
--
it
was
on
page
37,
the
statement
was
“the
foregoing
arguments
has
been
prepared
by
officers
of
the
department
of
justice
who
support
it”,
meaning
the
officers
of
the
department
of
justice
who
felt
that
they
could
formulate
those
arguments
and
support
them
without
any
reservation.
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes,
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
harris
weinstein
without
lieutenant
schuman
as
a
party,
i
question
that.
we
prefer
to
handle
this
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes,
sir.
mr.
harris
weinstein
well,
i
understand
your
concern
justice
fortas.
i
--
perhaps
it
ought
to
be
made
clear
that
as
i
understand
it,
my
assignment
is
to
present
that
side.
and
in
terms
of
one
being
subordinate,
i
do
not
think
that
or
do
not
concede
that
i
would
have
any
difficulty,
except
if
i
fail
to
present
the
servicemen
side
as
well
as
i
could.
mr.
harris
weinstein
who
assigned
me?
mr.
harris
weinstein
the
solicitor
general,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes,
sir.
mr.
harris
weinstein
he
knew
that
i
was
going
to
take
the
servicemen
side.
he
was
fully
aware
of
it.
mr.
harris
weinstein
the
authority
which
is
in
statute
and
in
regulations
is
the
authority
i
suppose
of
the
solicitor
general
to
assign
attorneys
in
the
employee
of
the
government
to
appear
in
this
court
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
--
on
cases
in
which
the
government
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
can't
answer
that
question
directly
justice
black.
i
don't
know
if
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
can't
answer
at
this
point
whether
there's
a
specific
statutory
possession.
mr.
harris
weinstein
by
the
united
states.
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes.
now,
i
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
think
the
best
discussion
of
our
authority
is
in
the
fourth
circuit
decision
in
united
states
v.
arlington
county,
which
is
in
326
f.2d,
and
i
think
that
the
discussion
of
the
united
states
standing
in
the
suit
of
this
nature
is
set
forth
there.
mr.
harris
weinstein
in
that
particular
case?
mr.
harris
weinstein
that
particular
case
involved
the
application
of
virginia
ad
valorem
taxation.
and
the
position
of
the
united
states
there
was
that
that
taxation
should
not
be
imposed
and
could
not
be
imposed
under
section
514.
mr.
harris
weinstein
that
we
have
proper
standing
as
representatives
of
the
servicemen
to
appear
and
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
my
recollection
is
that
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
my
recollection
is
the
latter
justice
white,
but
i
might
be
wrong.
mr.
harris
weinstein
not
as
a
party
mr.
chief
justice.
he
was
dismissed
for
inability
to
have
the
jurisdictional
amount
in
a
class
action.
i
see
that
my
time
has
expired,
almost
expired
and
i
have
yet
to
reach
any
discussion
of
the
merits.
and
if
the
court
pleases,
i
should
like
to
proceed
on
the
merits.
mr.
harris
weinstein
to
continue
with
them.
and
if
i
may,
i
--
if
the
court
would
hear
me
beyond
my
half
hour
because
i
can't
believe
that
in
the
next
five
minutes
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
would
do
my
best
in
that
limited
time
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
that
the
--
i'd
like
to
turn
first
if
i
may
to
the
discussion
of
commander
foster's
case
by
mr.
ahern,
because
i
think
that
what
happened
to
commander
foster
may
best
illustrate
why
section
514
was
adopted
and
why
the
courts
below
were
correct.
commander
foster
bought
a
car
in
connecticut.
he
lived
--
he
was
a
domiciliary
of
texas.
he
wanted
to
register
his
car
in
texas.
he
wrote
to
texas
and
he
was
told
that
to
register
there,
he
had
to
pay
a
texas
sales
tax.
the
dealer
in
connecticut
told
him
he
nevertheless
had
to
pay
a
connecticut
tax
to
get
his
car.
his
affidavit
states
that
he
called
the
department
of
motor
vehicles
in
connecticut,
and
was
told
that
there
was
no
credit.
he
had
to
pay
what,
he
says,
was
--
he
was
told
to
the
--
a
connecticut
use
tax.
to
get
his
car
and
to
register
it
in
his
home
state
in
texas,
he
paid
the
texas
tax
and
both
connecticut
tax.
and
it
isn't
until
this
court
in
mr.
ahern's
argument
here
that
he
has
been
told
that
he
didn't
have
to
pay
both
taxes.
now,
we
suggest
that
section
514
was
intended
to
avoid
this
kind
of
situation.
that
it
was
intended
to
create
a
situation
where
the
only
jurisdiction
which
could
tax
servicemen
in
this
position
would
be
his
home
state.
514
was
added
to
the
soldiers'
and
sailors'
civil
relief
act
in
1942.
it
was
--
the
language
that
we
are
interested
in
here
was
added
in
1944.
i
would
suggest
the
basic
problem
is
whether
the
language
or
the
policy
or
the
basis
for
this
--
of
the
statute
in
any
way
allow
a
distinction
to
be
drawn
between
ad
valorem
taxation,
annual
ad
valorem
taxation,
which
everybody
agrees
is
forbidden
by
the
statute
and
sales
and
use
tax.
the
starting
place,
i
would
suggest,
should
be
the
language
of
the
statute.
it
refers
in
its
terms
to
what
is
called
“taxation
in
respect
of
personal
property”.
now
this
is
what
seemed
to
be
the
broadest
possible
language.
it
is
not
ad
valorem
taxation.
it
is
not
seemingly
restricted
to
anyone's
specific
type
of
taxation,
but
taxation
in
respect
to
personal
property.
this
would
seem
to
catch
any
tax
that
has
to
do
with
personal
property
that
depends
or
is
triggered
by
the
existence
of
personal
property.
and
any
such
tax
under
section
514
is
supposed
to
be
forbidden
except
when
imposed
or
exacted
by
the
servicemen
state
of
residence
or
domicile.
in
the
way
that
the
--
this
mechanism
works
is
to
create
what
might
be
called
a
fictional
location
of
the
servicemen's
personal
property.
the
personal
property
is
deemed
not
to
be
in
any
state
where
he
appears
and
is
not
a
resident
or
a
domiciliary,
and
any
state
where
he's
taken
solely
by
his
military
orders.
i
don't
think
that
anyone
has
suggested
exactly
how
this
phrase
can
be
read
in
a
way
that
would
set
--
describe
only
ad
valorem
taxes,
but
would
not
describe
sales
or
use
taxes.
i
think
this
is
particularly
clear
with
use
taxes.
use
taxes
require
the
physical
presence
of
property
within
a
taxing
jurisdiction.
it
can
be
imposed
only
when
property
is
used
in
the
jurisdiction.
and
that
occurs
--
that
can
not
occur
in
the
case
of
a
nonresident
serviceman
because
of
section
514.
his
property
can
never
be
deemed
to
be
in
a
jurisdiction
other
than
his
home
state
for
purposes
of
local
taxation.
this
is
also
true
i
think,
of
sales
taxes
and
if
connecticut
statute,
which
i
think
is
typical,
it
doesn't
just
as
they
say
tax
the
privilege
of
a
sale.
it
--
the
tax
comes
into
being
only
when
there
is
a
sale
of
personal
property.
personal
and
furthermore,
it
only
happens
when
the
possession
of
this
personal
property
is
taken
in
connecticut.
under
section
514
that
possession
is
got
to
be
considered
as
taking
place
in
the
serviceman's
home
state.
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes,
mr.
justice
black.
in
our
brief
at
pages
2
to
4
and
also
in
connecticut's
brief,
i
think
in
the
appendix.
i'm
not
--
and
the
particular
language
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
the
brief?
mr.
harris
weinstein
within
the
last
three
weeks,
i
believe.
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes,
sir.
and
the
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
but
the
language
of
the
statute
is
this,
mr.
justice
black.
a
person
--
a
personal
property,
meaning
personal
property
of
the
nonresident
serviceman
shall
not
be
deemed
to
be
located
or
present
in
or
to
have
a
situs
for
taxation
in
such
state
and
so
forth.
the
situs
for
taxation
of
a
serviceman's
personal
property
is
deemed
to
be
his
home
state
and
not
the
state
where
he
goes
on
military
orders,
so
that
the
language
and
the
mechanism
of
the
statute
don't
seem
to
allow
any
distinction
between
these
types
of
taxes.
i
would
suggest
the
same
thing
is
true
of
the
policies
of
this
statute.
this
purpose
of
the
statute
as
expressed
by
congress
and
by
this
court
was
to
avoid
any
real
threat,
any
possibility
of
double
taxation
by
multiple
jurisdictions.
and
it
was
to
achieve
this
not
by
some
manner
of
trying
to
find
out
which
state
you
grant
to
credit
for
the
other
state,
which
is
the
kind
of
thing
that
has
happened
in
commander
foster's
case
and
is
never
then
really
resolved.
rather,
the
purpose
of
the
statute
was
to
leave
the
sole
function
of
the
tax,
the
sole
ability
to
tax
to
the
home
state,
to
the
serviceman's
residence
or
domicile.
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
think
justice
harlan
the
risk
of
double
taxation
comes
out
of
a
complimentary
function
of
the
sales
and
use
taxations.
as
the
two
courts
below
said,
they're
not
really
separate
taxes,
they're
merged
into
one.
the
use
taxes
in
so
much
as
a
matter
of
raising
revenue
by
itself,
but
it's
a
complement
in
a
means
of
enforcing
the
sales
tax.
and
i
would
suggest
that
this
is
double
taxation
when
a
sale
--
serviceman
buys
a
car
in
one
state
and
is
charged
a
sales
tax
and
he
goes
to
the
other
--
another
state
where
he
is
then
charged
a
use
tax,
which
use
tax
would
not
have
been
imposed
if
he
had
originally
bought
the
car
in
the
second
state
and
paid
a
sales
tax.
mr.
harris
weinstein
in
one
of
two
situations.
if
as
commander
foster
tried
to
do,
the
serviceman
seeks
to
register
his
car
in
his
home
state,
generally
the
home
state
will
seek
to
impose
a
tax.
the
other
thing
which
comes
to
the
potential
of
double
taxation
which
is
also
within
the
purposes
of
this
statute
is
that
ultimately,
we
would
--
i'd
assume
the
serviceman
is
going
home.
and
when
he
goes
home
he
brings
back
his
property
with
him
whatever
he's
acquired.
and
at
that
time,
he
is
going
to
be
subjected
to
a
use
tax
on
this
property.
and
this
is
the
point
in
time
when
double
taxation
is
almost
certain.
i
suggest
really
in
terms
of
potential
for
double
taxation,
this
ought
to
be
compared
to
the
structure
of
the
ad
valorem
taxation.
ad
valorem
taxation
isn't
going
to
be
doubly
imposed
anymore
frequently
than
the
use
tax
or
in
sales
tax
structures.
it
would
really
depend
on
the
accident
of
a
man
being
switched
from
jurisdiction
to
jurisdiction
within
one
year
being
in
one
state
on
its
ad
valorem
tax
day,
and
then
in
another
state
later
in
the
year
or
earlier
on
its
ad
valorem
tax
day.
mr.
harris
weinstein
that's
right.
mr.
harris
weinstein
that's
right.
sales
tax
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
that
is
our
position.
i
think
that
the
other
side
argues
that
the
phrase,
the
initial
phrase
of
the
statute
for
the
purposes
of
taxation
in
respect
to
personal
property
means
only
ad
valorem
taxation
in
respect
personal
property.
it
doesn't
catch
any
other
tax.
and
i
see
that
my
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
in
speaking
of
personal
property,
justice
fortas,
i
think
there
are
two
potential
bases
for
imposing
a
tax,
and
they're
dealt
within
two
separate
sentences
here.
one
is
a
tax
that
proceeds
on
residence
or
domicile
on
taxes
personal
property.
mr.
harris
weinstein
no.
mr.
harris
weinstein
no,
and
that
is
the
first
sentence
justice
fortas.
mr.
harris
weinstein
now,
the
sentence
that
begins
on
the
top
of
page
3
in
the
middle
of
the
first
line
which
again
begins
for
the
purposes
of
taxation
in
respect
of,
it
doesn't
say
person
now,
but
personal
property,
income
or
gross
income.
first,
it
defines
the
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
of
any
such
person.
now
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes,
and
that
would
be
i
think
a
reference
to
the
“any
person”
in
the
first
sentence
perhaps
modified,
and
i
suppose
modified
by
the
language
--
person
being
absent
there
from,
from
his
home
state
in
compliance
with
military
or
naval
orders
in
the
first
sentence.
and
then
as
you
go
one
in
this
sentence,
first
it
describes
a
source
of
income
and
says
military
pay
shall
not
be
deemed
to
be
from
within
the
home
state.
and
then
for
present
purposes,
the
language
is
personal
property
shall
not
be
deemed
to
be
located
or
present
in
or
to
have
a
situs
for
taxation
in
such
state
territory
possession
or
political
division
or
district.
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
think
that
that
--
whether
that
is
so
depends
on
how
the
sales
and
use
tax
statutes
work.
now,
use
tax
statutes
are
applied
only
when
property
is
within
and
used
within
the
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes,
but
the
sales
tax
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes,
but
the
sales
tax
also
depends
on
physical
presence
of
the
property
in
the
taxing
jurisdiction.
under
the
connecticut
statute
and
while
the
language
is
different
in
other
states,
the
effect
is
the
same.
the
tax
is
imposed
only
when
there
is
a
sale
and
when
physical
possession
is
taken
in
the
taxing
jurisdiction.
mr.
harris
weinstein
this
is
the
same
kind
of
tax
that
was
before
the
court
last
term
in
the
massachusetts
bank
case
and
it's
a
vendee
tax.
the
legal
incidence
is
on
the
buyer.
the
seller
is
given
an
action
in
debt
to
collect
--
and
is
directed
to
pass
the
tax
on
to
the
buyer.
and
it's
clearly
a
vendee
tax.
mr.
harris
weinstein
the
seller
is
liable
to
the
state.
the
buyer
is
liable
to
the
seller.
and
it's
the
same
structure
as
this
court
labeled
a
vendee
tax
last
term.
mr.
harris
weinstein
well
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
it's
imposed
on
the
sale
of
tangible
personal
property.
so
that
it
purports
to
be
on
the
sale,
but
it's
not
just
the
sale
alone.
there
must
be
tangible
personal
property.
and
the
word
sale
and
selling
are
defined
in
the
statute,
in
the
connecticut
statute
in
words
that
are
quoted
in
pages
28
and
29
of
the
brief
here.
and
it
says
mean
and
include
any
transfer
of
title,
exchange
or
barter
and
so
forth.
now,
transfer
of
title
under
the
general
rule
of
the
uniform
commercial
code
which
applies
in
connecticut
and
i
think
almost
all
states
by
now
is
the
title
is
transferred
when
the
seller's
responsibility
is
asked
to
delivery
or
complete
it,
so
that
this
definition
of
sale
incorporates
a
concept
of
a
transfer
of
physical
possession
so
that
you
can't
view
the
sale
tax
as
simply
being
on
some
abstract
privilege
of
selling.
mr.
harris
weinstein
well,
if
there
is
no
transfer
of
possession,
if
the
property
is
supposed
to
stay
a
word
as
this
brings
in
to
play
a
different
part
of
the
uniform
commercial
code
which
would
transfer
title
at
that
earlier
time.
but
i
think
where
we're
talking
here
about
movable
chattels,
boats,
cars,
appliances,
things
of
that
sort,
there
are
things
that
contemplate
transfer.
mr.
harris
weinstein
food
and
drink
under
the
stipulation,
i
think
would
--
the
stipulation
says
that
everyday
purchases
are
made
in
the
post-exchange
or
commissary.
and
those
under
the
buck
act
which
is
i
think
section
107
of
title
4
are
explicitly
exempt
from
sales
and
use
tax.
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
didn't
understand
that
to
be
in
the
stipulation.
i
just
understood
that
that
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
well,
if
i
can
avoid
the
cigarette
tax
which
is
different
state
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
i'll
take
the
sales
tax
on
it.
mr.
harris
weinstein
such
say
a
tube
of
toothpaste
which
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
think
the
position
on
this
side
of
the
case
would
be
that
the
exemption
applies
simply
because
there
is
no
way
of
parsing
neither
section
514
or
the
connecticut
tax
to
apply
to
only
to
say
big
ticket
items
and
not
to
small
purchase.
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes,
i
think
the
impact.
i'm
saying
that
that's
the
thrust
of
the
legislative
judgment
in
this
statute.
the
function
of
the
stipulation
i
think
is
to
show
that
that
kind
of
impact
is
not
likely
to
exist
because
purchases
of
this
kind
are
not
made
in
stores
that
are
generally
subject
to
that
type
of
--
to
the
state
tax
but
are
made
in
official
installations
where
the
tax
doesn't
apply.
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes,
i
think
whether
that
would
fall
under
section
514.
mr.
harris
weinstein
i'd
like
to
start
by
saying
i
don't
think
that's
in
this
case.
at
least
it
has
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
well,
i
think
i've
struggle
with
the
problem
of
how
do
you
characterize
the
right
to
occupy
a
motel
or
hotel
room
for
a
night.
and
under
section
514
the
problem
comes
down
to
whether
you
can
characterize
this
right
as
an
intangible
personal
property.
if
it
is,
it
would
be
exempt.
i
suspect
it
isn't.
it
seems
to
more
in
the
nature
of
a
real
property
interest
which
would
not
be
caught.
but
whether
that
comes
under
section
514
is
a
rather
different
problem
than
these
admittedly
tangible
items
which
have
physical
location
that
do
move
around,
where
a
hotel
room
doesn't
and
certainly
seem
to
be
the
type
of
objects
that
section
514
was
intended
to
deal
with.
now,
there
are
other
points
that
i
think
are
adequately
covered
in
part
1
of
the
brief
which
is
the
discussion
of
the
buck
act,
the
supposed
administrative
problems
and
the
constitutional
attack
which
i
think
this
court
put
to
rest
in
the
case
of
dameron
against
brodhead
some
years
ago.
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
would
think
that
the
existence
of
the
controversy
--
again
i
would
like
to
go
back
to
the
confession
situation,
because
in
the
confession
situation
the
government
is
clearly
saying
now,
we
don't
think
now
that
in
a
criminal
case
this
man
could've
been
prosecuted
or
should've
been
prosecuted
in
this
way.
mr.
harris
weinstein
the
very
least
there
is
here
is
a
controversy
between
the
servicemen
and
the
state,
which
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
the
difficulty
i
have
is
in
distinguishing
between
this
case
as
i
said
and
i
guess
i'm
not
adding
anything
new
to
what
i've
said
in
any
instance
of
confession
of
error.
i
think
that
the
--
what
you're
saying
would
lead
to
the
route
that
if
there
is
a
confession
of
error
that
would
moot
the
controversy,
certainly
if
the
confession
went
to
the
propriety
of
the
charge
say
that
was
brought
as
opposed
to
some
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
if
this
were
the
district
court
or
court
of
appeals
after
last
wednesday,
i'd
have
to
agree
with
that
because
i
think
it
was
last
wednesday
that
decided
the
case.
and
i
don't
think
it
was
a
prediction
of
that
outcome
that
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
well
he
was
just
--
you
mean
why
did
he
not
appeal?
mr.
harris
weinstein
he
was
this
--
are
you
taking
about
the
arlington
county
case?
mr.
harris
weinstein
i'm
sorry
i
was
confused.
mr.
harris
weinstein
i'm
not
certain
about
it,
but
i
assume
its
reason
similar
to
this
case
where
one
man
would
not
ordinarily
have
$10,000.00
jurisdiction
alone.
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes,
but
if
i
can
just
try
once
more
on
this
analogy.
suppose
a
criminal
charge
is
brought
and
the
claim
of
the
defendant
is
that
this
charge
is
barred
by
the
constitution
and
this
is
the
matter
in
which
the
case
is
litigated.
and
in
this
court
there
is
a
confession
of
error
to
it
a
statement
that
it
is
then
the
position
of
the
united
states
that
this
charge
is
indeed
unconstitutional.
now,
i
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
would
think
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
perhaps
this
would
--
it
seems
to
me
that
the
united
states
which
clearly
has
a
function
as
a
guardian
for
certain
purposes
of
servicemen,
in
that
capacity
would
have
a
capacity
that
is
different
and
distinct
from
its
position
as
its
general
position
as
sovereign.
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes,
but
i
think
it
is
part
of
that
because
the
servicemen's
interest
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
think
that
you
--
it's
hard
to
know
what
would
have
done.
for
example,
it
would
be
entirely
possible
for
the
department
of
justice
to
appear
on
behalf
of
the
other
side
of
the
case.
now
perhaps
then
it
would
have
been
brought
in
a
state
court
rather
than
the
federal
court.
now,
i
think
--
i
would
suggest
the
district
court
and
court
of
appeals
jurisdiction
has
to
be
viewed
in
terms
of
what
the
situation
was
at
that
time.
this
court
is
---
would
have
jurisdiction
certainly
of
this
case
and
it
came
up
through
the
state
system,
and
if
you
were
to
argue
that
the
case
or
controversy
has
disappeared
as
between
the
united
states,
i
think
in
terms
of
this
court's
jurisdiction,
it
still
has
to
be
considered
in
terms
of
the
existence
a
capacity
on
the
united
states
to
appear
as
the
representative,
as
the
guardian
of
the
servicemen.
mr.
harris
weinstein
but
that
an
issue
which
would
depend
on
something
that
developed
after
the
decision
in
the
district
court
and
court
of
appeals.
mr.
harris
weinstein
well
as
i
--
it
is
--
as
i
said
it
is
uncommon.
as
i
said
earlier,
i
do
not
think
it
is
unprecedented.
and
it
occurs
to
me
now
that
there
is
a
case
that
i
might
have
cited
that
would
be
somewhat
better
for
this
purpose
than
the
kornhauser
case,
and
perhaps
i
should've
cited
it
first.
and
i
think
this
is
burnet
against
northern
trust
company.
again
a
tax
case,
i
believe
from
the
1930's
and
i
--
it
may
be
in
283
united
states
reports,
i'm
not
certain.
but
this
is
a
situation
where
the
brief
had
one
half
prepared
--
one
part
prepared
by
the
revenue,
by
the
treasury
department
and
the
other
half
by
the
department
of
justice.
and
the
treasury
appeared
to
present
its
case,
although
the
controversy
is
as
much
there
between
the
government
and
the
taxpayer.
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
suppose
the
case
would
be
--
had
been
closer
to
the
northern
trust
if
this
case
had
been
brought
in
the
name
of
the
secretary
of
defense
as
the
northern
trust
case
was
brought
against
the
collector
of
internal
revenue.
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
did
not
in
--
i
hope
i
didn't
characterize
my
function
in
that
way.
i
tried
to
put
it
in
terms
of
the
being
assigned
to
come
here
for
an
adversarial
presentation.
mr.
harris
weinstein
no,
i
cannot
say
i
did.
mr.
harris
weinstein
well,
i
think
i'll
cite
what
i
can
offer
on
this
mr.
chief
justice.
