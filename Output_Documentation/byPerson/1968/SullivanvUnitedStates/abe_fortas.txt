justice
abe
fortas
mr.
weinstein,
are
there
only
tow
points
of
view
in
the
department
of
justice?
i
mean,
aren't
there
some
lawyers
there
that
have
a
third
or
a
fourth
point
of
view?
justice
abe
fortas
in
oral
argument,
is
anybody
going
for
the
government
going
to
present
the
view
that
it
should
be
reversed?
justice
abe
fortas
if
you
were
--
we're
not
to
assume
are
we
that
the,
on
the
one
side
are
the
solicitor
general
and
the
assistant
attorney
general.
that
is
to
say
that
they
share
the
views
of
the
state
of
connecticut.
and
on
the
other
side
is
the
attorney
general,
we're
not
to
make
that
assumption,
are
we?
justice
abe
fortas
but
who
is
on
the
other
side?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
weinstein.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
weinstein
i
want
a
case
that
you
say
that
i'm
eager,
and
i'm
sure
we
all
are
very
eager
to
hear
your
arguments.
and
your
arguments
were
always
very
able,
very
cogent.
the
perplexing
problem
for
me
is
that
we're
here
confronted
with
the
case
in
which
is
rather
unconventional
since
we
usually
have
adversary
parties
where
the
united
states
participates.
there
is
a
specific
view
of
the
united
states
what
the
united
states
is
advocating.
justice
abe
fortas
276?
justice
abe
fortas
was
that
a
conflict
within
the
department
of
justice,
because
this
apparently
is
a
conflict
within
the
department
of
justice.
no,
it's
not
like
a
situation
where
hardly
or
wholly
of
a
result
to
statute?
the
icc
for
example,
takes
one
position
and
the
department
of
justice
takes
another.
justice
abe
fortas
and
here
we
have
no
statement
of
the
position
of
the
department
of
defense,
do
we?
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
i
thank
you
mr.
justice.
justice
abe
fortas
now
mr.
weinstein,
i'm
sure
you're
going
to
make
every
argument
that
can
be
made
on
the
side
that
you
are
representing.
i
want
to
make
clear
from
my
point
of
view
what
the
basic
embarrassment
is
that
i
think
that
this
procedure
presents.
and
that
is
that
the
servicemen
might
very
well
feel
that
this
case
has
not
been
presented
to
this
court
on
a
truly
adversary
basis.
i
hasten
to
say
that
i
know
that
it
will
be
in
fact.
but
in
form,
it
is
not
being
presented
to
this
court
in
my
judgment
on
an
adversary
basis.
and
legal
procedures,
i'm
sure
you'll
agree
form
has
some
importance.
now,
it's
being
their
--
the
soldiers
point
of
view
is
being
presented
here
by
an
extremely
able
lawyer
and
advocate,
but
as
a
matter
of
form,
it
is
being
presented
by
a
man
who
is
subordinate
to
an
official
who
has
taken
the
opposite
point
of
view.
and
i
think
that's,
from
my
point
of
view,
that's
the
real
embarrassment
and
having
stated
that
i
want
to
show
you
that
i'm
very
eager
to
hear
what
you
have
to
say.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
what's
the
part
of
the
statute
on
which
you
rely,
go
back
to
page
2
of
your
brief,
because
as
i
read
that
it
says,
“such
person
shall
not
be
deemed
to
have
lost
a
residence
or
domicile
in
his
state
solely
by
reason
of
being
absent
there
from
the
compliance
of
military
orders,
or
to
have
acquired
a
residence
or
domicile
in
the
other
state.”
now,
is
somewhere
in
that
part
of
the
statute,
do
you
find
this
court
for
your
position?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
that's
not
applicable
here,
would
you
agree?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
what's
the
other
one?
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
of
any
such
person.
justice
abe
fortas
which
indicates
property,
personal
property
owned
by
the
person,
doesn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
just
reading
that
plainly
in
a
common
place
manner,
it
does
seem
to
support
the
state's
position
rather
than
yours,
doesn't
it?
in
other
words,
you
have
--
your
position
has
to
depend
upon
doing
a
little
magic
with
the
words,
doesn't
it
in
taking
what
you
deem
to
be
the
sense
of
the
provision
rather
than
its
specific
language?
justice
abe
fortas
no,
but
the
use
tax
in
this
sense,
as
i
understand
it
is
a
sales
--
it's
a
part
of
the
sales
tax
in
the
sense
that
it
is
a
complimentary
to
the
sales
tax
for
the
purpose
of
trying
to
plug
what
would
otherwise
be
an
obvious
hole
under
the
sales
tax.
justice
abe
fortas
isn't
that
the
kind
of
use
tax
we're
talking
about
here?
justice
abe
fortas
well
no,
not
necessarily.
that
is
to
say
you
couldn't
have
a
transaction
in
connecticut,
i've
had
some
in
which
there's
no
transfer
of
physical
possession
what
the
sales
tax
is
collecting.
justice
abe
fortas
but
which
we're
mostly
talking
about
here
i
suppose
is
food
and
drink.
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that,
but
how
about
is
it
stipulated
here
--
i
noticed
it
stipulated
at,
at
least
i
think
i
remember
it's
stipulated
that
no
attempt
would
be
made
that
there
is
no
opposition
to
the
collection
of
the
sales
tax
with
respect
to
groceries
bought
in
a
grocery
store
in
new
london
for
example
by
a
soldier.
what
about
that?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
is
it
the
government's
position
that
when
a
soldier
goes
into
a
store
in
new
london
to
buy
a
pack
of
cigarettes
that
he's
exempt
from
the
sales
tax?
justice
abe
fortas
no,
i'm
talking
about
the
sales
tax
on
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
on
a
pack
of
cigarettes.
justice
abe
fortas
alright.
justice
abe
fortas
that's
what
i
thought
and
in
short
that
your
position
is
that
the
sales
tax
ought
not
to
be
collected
on
the
purchase
of
toothpaste
by
a
soldier
from
the
store?
justice
abe
fortas
