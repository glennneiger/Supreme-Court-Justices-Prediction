mr.
ahern?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
weinstein.
chief
justice
earl
warren
by
what
authority?
chief
justice
earl
warren
who
is
their
representative
here?
it
just
seems
to
me
that
this
is
an
anomaly
that
we
shouldn't
give
furtherance
to
have
a
deputy
of
the
solicitor
general
come
here
and
seek
to
override
the
opinion
of
the
solicitor
general
as
to
what
the
public
interest
is,
and
ask
us
to
follow
the
deputy
as
against
the
head
of
his
office.
now
that
i
can't
understand.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
say
we.
who
--
who
is
we?
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
may
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
all
of
them
in
the
office
who
worked
on
it
or
against
the
solicitor
general?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
are
we
entitled
to
approach
the
case
in
this
way?
that
the
solicitor
general
of
the
united
states
and
the
state
of
connecticut
both
are
of
the
opinion
that
--
and
are
urging
this
court
upon
this
court
that
the
statute
is
constitutional.
but
that
his
deputy
argues
that
it
is
not,
and
we
decide
it
one
way
or
the
other?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
no
is
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
is
that
not
fair?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
if
the
supremacy
clause
would
be
involve
would
it
if
the
act,
if
the
soldiers'
and
sailors'
civil
relief
act
applies
to
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
say
the
position
of
the
state
of
connecticut
is
the
statue
is
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
unconstitutional?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
speaking
of
the
soldiers'
and
sailors'
civil
relief
act,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
i
thought
you're
talking
about
the
tax
act.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
aren't
we
entitled
to
know
what
the
government
represents
as
the
public
interest
in
this
case?
and
if
so,
i
again
say
who
are
we
to
take
that
closing
from?
from
the
solicitor
general
or
from
his
deputy
who
appears
hearing
the
nature
of
a
friend
of
the
court?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
part
2
of
your
brief?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
you
argue
against?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
i
think
we're
entitled
to
know.
i
don't
think
the
government
can
eat
its
cake
and
keep
it
too.
i
think
we're
entitled
to
know
what
does
a
solicitor
general's
office
represent
as
the
public
interest
in
this
case.
and
if
we
take
the
view
of
the
solicitor
general
of
the
united
states
as
we've
been
bearably
do
as
to
what
the
public
interest
is,
by
what
right
does
his
deputy
come
here
and
say
the
opposite?
now,
if
you
appear
as
a
friend
of
the
court,
i'd
be
perfectly
willing
to
grant
you
permission
to
do
that
as
an
individual.
but
i
don't
see
how
you
can
come
here
and
speak
for
the
government
as
a
deputy
solicitor
general
when
the
solicitor
general
himself
has
the
opposite
view
in
expressing
it
to
this
court.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
you
signed
the
brief
as
speaking
for
the
government.
your
name
is
on
these
briefs
speaking
for
the
united
states.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
there
is
no
serviceman
in
this
case.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
take
an
extra
five
minutes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
weinstein,
i
don't
think
we'd
have
any
problem
in
this
case
if
what
you're
arguing
to
is,
was
the
position
or
is
the
position
of
the
united
states
government
that
this
is
an
adversary
suit
between
the
united
states
and
the
state
of
connecticut
and
we
come
into
this
court?
and
we
don't
have
an
adversary
proceeding
at
all.
we
have
no
argument
at
all
on
the
part
of
the
united
states
in
this
court
as
to
what
it
believes
the
public
interest
is
or
the
rights
of
these
veterans.
we
have
a
contrary
view
that
is
the
opposite
of
what
the
government
says
officially.
and
we
close
this
case
without
any
argument
at
all
from
the
government
as
to
why
it
agrees
with
the
state
of
connecticut
in
this
particular
matter.
isn't
that
a
strange
situation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
here
is
a
different
situation.
that's
two
agencies
of
the
government.
but
here
all
we
have
here
as
i
see
it
is
that
the
government,
the
official
position
of
the
government
is
that
the
statute
of
the
state
is
constitutional.
and
this
is
an
internal
fight
in
the
department
and
the
solicitor
general
having
taken
the
official
position
for
the
government
does
not
appear,
and
those
in
his
employ
come
here
and
argue
the
opposite
way
from
the
way
he
comes
out,
and
will
after
that
any
argument
at
all
on
the
part
of
the
united
states.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
might
be
different,
but
we've
had
that
with
the
icc.
we've
had
the
solicitor
general
on
one
side
and
the
icc
on
the
other.
we've
had
it
with
the
selective
service
recently.
we've
had
it
with
a
number
of
them.
but
we
haven't
had
it
because
of
an
internal
difference
of
opinion
in
the
department
of
justice
where
the
deputies
of
the
solicitor
general
prevail
over
the
attorney
general
and
although
--
or
over
the
solicitor
general,
and
now
although
he
states
his
opinion
in
general
terms,
the
deputy
comes
in
here
and
argues
against
that
position.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
did
you
argued
to
us
the
official
position
of
the
government?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
well
then
you
hardly
have
given
us
a
balance
view
with
this
situation.
well,
i
no
intent
to
barge
in,
i
just
--
it
bewilders
me
and
bothers
me
as
to
whether
we
have
had
an
adversary
proceeding
here.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
well
i
think
we
have
on
this,
very
well.
mr.
ahern
did
you
have
anything
further?
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
