mr.
f.
michael
ahern
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
appeal
has
been
taken
by
state
of
connecticut
from
a
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit,
affirming
a
lower
court
ruling.
that
ruling
held
that
the
application
of
sales
and
use
taxes
to
the
purchase
and
use
of
property
by
non-resident
servicemen
in
connecticut
to
be
in
contravention
of
section
514
of
the
soldiers'
and
sailors'
civil
relief
act.
this
case
was
instituted
by
an
able
lieutenant
named
schuman,
and
the
united
states
of
america
in
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
connecticut,
claiming
immunity
from
the
application
of
the
tax
to
a
boat,
a
pleasure
boat
purchased
by
lieutenant
schuman
in
connecticut,
on
the
basis
that
section
514
of
the
soldiers'
and
sailors'
relief
act
granted
that
immunity
from
sales
taxes.
the
district
court
dismissed
the
claim
of
schuman
for
lack
of
jurisdiction
from
which
no
appeal
has
been
taken.
it
granted
summary
judgment
to
the
united
states
which
judgment
was
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals
on
july
10,
1968.
notice
of
intent
to
appeal
was
filed
july
30th,
the
case
was
docketed
on
october
7th
and
this
court
noted
probable
jurisdiction
on
january
13,
1969.
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court
rests
on
28
u.s.c.
1254
subsection
(2).
i
should
like
to
state
at
this
time
that
the
state
of
texas
has
filed
an
amicus
brief
in
which
30
other
states
have
joined.
the
state
of
new
york
and
the
state
of
california
had
each
filed
independent
amicus
briefs.
illinois
has
joined
california
in
its
brief.
we
commend
these
briefs
to
the
court,
and
thank
the
states
for
their
interests
and
efforts
on
our
behalf,
and
at
the
same
time,
i
should
like
to
commend
to
the
court
the
second
part
of
the
brief
of
the
appellee
in
this
case,
the
united
states
of
america,
starting
at
page
37
through
43,
which
does
not
subscribe
to
the
arguments
which
are
represented
in
the
first
part
of
the
brief.
the
issues
in
this
case
are
whether
the
lower
court
heard
in
determining
that
section
514
of
the
soldiers'
and
sailors'
civil
relief
act
prohibits
the
application
of
sales
and
use
taxes
to
the
private
purchase
transactions
of
servicemen
stationed
in
the
states
throughout
the
country
under
military
orders.
and
further,
whether
section
514
as
interpreted
by
the
court
of
appeals
is
an
unconstitutional
infringement
on
the
reserved
powers
of
the
states
to
tax,
under
article
x
of
the
united
states
constitution.
the
facts
in
this
case
of
brief,
the
parties
to
the
action
stipulated
that
the
everyday
purchases
of
tangible
personal
property
by
servicemen,
are
made
at
pxs
on
military
installations
and
are
therefore
not
subject
to
taxation.
so
they
are
not
a
part
of
this
case.
this
case
is
involved
with
purchases
of
larger
items
by
servicemen
such
as
pleasure
boats,
cars,
television
sets
and
so
forth
which
they
can
not
get
at
pxs.
in
the
lower
court,
the
district
court,
the
united
states
government
presented
several
affidavits
which
allegedly
set
forth
facts
illustrative
of
the
situations
in
which
the
state
of
connecticut
was
assessing
sales
or
use
taxes
against
servicemen
in
connecticut.
i
should
like
to
address
myself
to
one
of
those
affidavits
at
this
time.
it's
the
affidavit
of
commander
william
foster
which
is
printed
in
the
record
appendix
at
page
21
(a)
through
27
(a).
commander
foster
was
a
texas
domiciliary
stationed
in
connecticut
who
purchased
a
car
from
a
connecticut
retail
dealer
and
paid
the
tax
thereon.
commander
foster
in
his
affidavit
claims
to
have
paid
a
use
tax
on
the
transaction.
that
statement
is
in
error.
at
page
6
and
at
page
23
of
the
government
brief
--
government's
brief,
it
refers
to
the
commander
foster
affidavit,
and
on
each
instance
it
states
that
commander
foster
paid
a
use
tax
to
the
state
of
connecticut.
these
statements
are
in
error.
the
purchase
by
commander
foster
was
from
a
connecticut
retail
dealer.
the
sale
took
place
within
the
state
and
he
paid
his
sales
tax
to
the
dealer.
i
direct
the
court's
attention
to
page
27
(a)
of
the
record
appendix
on
which
it
reproduced
the
invoice
covering
the
transaction.
and
on
the
invoice,
it
very
plainly
states
sales
taxes
were
paid
to
the
dealer.
and
significantly,
at
page
41
of
the
government's
brief,
and
this
is
in
the
second
part
which
doesn't
agree
with
the
first
part,
a
reference
is
made
to
this
affidavit.
and
the
reference
is
that
commander
foster
paid
a
sales
tax
to
the
state
of
connecticut.
in
this
connection
also,
my
friends
from
the
attorney
general's
office
in
the
state
of
texas
tell
me
that
i've
committed
a
grievous
error
in
my
brief
at
page
6,
wherein
i
refer
to
commander
foster's
affidavit
and
state
that
after
paying
sales
tax
to
the
state
of
connecticut,
commander
foster
was
required
to
pay
a
use
tax
to
the
state
of
texas
before
registering
the
vehicle.
the
attorney
general's
office
in
texas
advises
me
that
since
1961,
texas
has
had
a
reciprocity
provision
in
its
statutes
granting
credit
for
any
sales
or
use
taxes
paid
to
another
jurisdiction
on
a
motor
vehicle
which
is
brought
into
connecticut
or
into
texas
for
use
therein.
i
would
ask
this
court
to
take
judicial
notice
of
the
laws
of
the
state
of
texas
in
that
regard.
one
final
reference
to
the
foster
affidavit,
in
the
lower
court,
when
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
was
heard,
the
government
presented
three
affidavits
to
the
court
for
its
consideration.
one
of
these
was
the
affidavit
of
commander
foster.
at
that
time,
i
filed
a
motion
to
strike
the
affidavit
from
the
record
on
the
basis
that
commander
foster
had
arrived
at
the
misapprehension
that
he
had
paid
a
use
tax,
rather
than
a
sales
tax
to
the
retail
dealer.
the
district
court
noted
my
objection,
but
did
not
rule
on
that
objection.
under
the
circumstances,
i
renew
that
objection
at
this
time,
and
claim
that
the
court
erred
and
not
ruling
on
the
motion.
and
i
would
ask
that
this
court
disregard
the
foster
affidavit
and
its
deliberations.
i
would
like
to
emphasize
to
this
court
that
this
is
a
case
of
first
impression
before
the
court.
in
the
last
25
years,
since
the
1944
amendment
to
the
soldiers'
and
sailors'
civil
relief
act,
no
claim
has
been
advanced
that
section
514
encompassed
sales
and
use
taxes.
it
wasn't
until
april
of
1967
when
this
case
was
filed
in
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
connecticut
that
the
claim
was
made
that
section
514
encompassed
sales
and
use
taxes.
so
that
this
is
the
first
opportunity
any
court
has
had
to
consider
the
issue.
it
is
the
position
of
the
state
of
connecticut
that
section
514
was
designed
and
intended
by
congress
to
grant
immunity
to
servicemen
from
property
taxes,
income
taxes
and
certain
annual
motor
vehicle
taxes
in
any
state
but
its
home
state
--
his
home
state.
the
statute
accomplishes
this
by
removing
the
jurisdictional
grounds
for
the
imposition
of
those
taxes.
that
is
residence,
domicile,
and
situs
of
the
property.
the
legislative
history
of
section
514
and
the
1944
amendment
and
the
1962
amendment
thereto
supports
this
position.
in
the
legislative
history
of
this
section
and
the
clarifying
amendments,
and
that's
what
they
were
characterized
at
the
time
they
were
proposed
to
congress
as
clarifying
amendments,
not
a
broadening
of
the
tax
immunity
already
granted
by
congress.
the
committee
hearings
and
the
reports
of
committees
contain
not
one
single
reference
to
sales
and
use
taxes.
however,
those
committee
hearings
and
the
reports
are
replete
with
references
to
income
and
property
taxes.
we
submit
to
the
court
that
the
silence
of
the
committee
hearings
and
the
silence
of
congress
as
to
sales
and
use
taxes
is
indicative
of
the
intention
congress
in
this
regard.
it
might
be
pointed
out
too
to
the
court
that
in
1940,
the
buck
act
was
passed
which
specifically
granted
the
states
the
rights
to
collect
sales
and
use
taxes
on
transactions
taking
place
on
federal
enclaves.
so
that
congress
was
well
aware
of
the
sales
and
use
tax
phase
of
taxation
at
the
time
it
passed
section
514
and
its
amendments.
it
is
interesting
to
know
that
the
district
of
columbia
which
is
governed
by
a
sub-committee
of
congress,
i
understand,
has
had
a
sales
and
use
tax
on
its
books
since
1949,
at
a
period
of
about
20
years
and
just
two
years
less
than
the
state
of
connecticut
has
had
its
tax.
the
government
in
the
lower
court
and
in
its
argument
and
in
this
court
is
strangely
silent
as
to
the
position
taken
by
the
taxing
officials
of
the
district
of
columbia
in
this
regard.
now,
certainly
if
any
taxing
officials
in
the
united
states
should
be
aware
of
the
intention
of
congress
and
the
mood
of
congress,
it
would
be
the
taxing
officials
of
the
district
of
columbia.
i
think
from
the
silence
in
this
regard,
we
can
infer
that
the
district
of
columbia
does
not
grant
tax
immunity
on
sales
and
use
taxes
on
the
purchases
of
servicemen
in
this
area.
we
submit
that
the
lower
court
erred
when
it
equated
a
sales
tax
to
a
property
tax
in
its
decision.
the
only
reason
for
equating
it
to
a
property
tax
was
that
the
ultimate
burden
of
the
tax
ultimately
fell
on
the
consumer.
we
submit
that
this
is
true
of
almost
any
tax
that
the
ultimate
burden
will
fall
on
the
consumer.
that
is
hardly
a
reason
for
equating
two
distinct
types
of
taxes.
the
court
of
appeals
compounded
this
error
by
following
the
same
reasoning.
we
submit
to
this
court
that
a
sales
tax
is
not
a
property
tax,
and
conversely
a
property
tax
is
not
a
sales
tax.
a
property
tax
difference
from
a
sales
tax
and
that
it
is
a
recurrent
annual
demand
based
on
capital
value
of
property.
whereas
a
sales
tax
is
based
on
the
purchase
price
or
the
--
it's
based
on
the
cost
of
acquisition
or
the
purchase
price
of
property.
and
it
is
only
taxed
one
time
at
the
date
of
acquisition
of
that
property.
a
property
tax
is
an
ad
valorem
tax.
and
in
51
american
jurisprudence
at
page
53,
which
is
not
in
my
brief,
section
26
it
states
it
very
succinctly
and
i'd
like
to
read
or
quote
for
the
court.
“an
ad
valorem
tax
is
a
tax
on
a
fixed
proportion
of
the
value
of
property
with
respect
to
which
the
tax
is
assessed
and
requires
the
intervention
of
assessors
or
appraisers
to
estimate
the
value
of
such
property
before
the
amount
due
from
each
taxpayer
may
be
determined.”
to
that
definition
must
be
added
that
the
statutes
provide
a
means
of
appeal
from
the
assessed
valuation
placed
on
property
by
an
assessor
to
a
board
of
tax
review
and
ultimately
to
the
courts.
so
that
an
owner
of
property
being
assessed
by
a
tax
assessor
has
recourse
to
a
board
of
tax
review
and
the
courts.
the
appellee
concedes
the
difference
between
a
property
tax
and
a
sales
tax
in
his
brief
at
page
20.
but
he
argues
that
such
difference
should
not
be
of
real
consequence
in
this
case.
we
strongly
disagree.
at
page
14
of
its
brief
also,
it
claims
that
congress
intended
that
the
tax
exemption
should
be
applied
to
any
tax
which
is
measured
by
the
value
of
property,
and
in
the
sales
tax
area,
the
value
is
the
purchase
price.
with
this
we
must
also
strongly
disagree.
the
value
in
taxation
or
the
word
value
in
taxation
is
peculiarly
applicable
to
personal
property
taxation.
it
does
not
have
the
same
meaning
as
purchase
price
in
sales
taxation.
as
stated
earlier,
an
ad
valorem
taxation
of
property,
a
value
is
placed
on
property
by
an
assessor
who
is
usually
a
public
official
before
the
tax
is
levied.
and
the
owner
of
the
property
has
the
right
of
appeal
to
the
board
of
tax
review
or
to
the
courts
for
relief
from
the
amount
of
the
assessment.
in
the
sales
and
use
tax
area,
the
tax
is
based
on
the
purchased
price
of
property.
the
purchase
price
is
set
at
the
whim
of
the
retailer,
and
if
the
purchaser
wants
the
property,
he
pays
the
purchase
price
without
recourse
to
anyone.
if
i
may
give
a
concrete
example
of
the
two
taxes,
i
would
suggest
that
we
let
represent
or
let
represent
two
neighbors
in
a
given
community
and
label
them
a
and
b.
each
owns
the
same
model
and
year
automobile.
for
local
property
tax
purposes
the
tax
assessor
places
a's
automobile
on
the
tax
list
at
the
value
of
$2,000.00.
he
places
b's
car
on
the
list
at
$4,000.00.
in
this
case,
b
has
recourse
to
the
board
of
tax
review
and
the
courts
to
have
his
valuation
of
$4,000.00
reduced
to
equalize
his
pays
with
a.
in
the
same
manner,
when
a
and
b
acquired
these
vehicles,
a
very
well
might
have
had
connections
in
the
automotive
field
which
allowed
him
to
buy
the
automobile
at
the
wholesale
price
of
$3,000.00.
the
sales
tax
would
apply
to
the
purchase
price
of
$3,000.00.
in
the
same
manner,
b
who
didn't
have
the
same
connections
might
have
to
pay
the
full
retail
price
of
$5,000.00.
in
this
case,
the
sales
tax
would
be
applied
to
the
$5,000.00
figure
and
neither
b
nor
a
could
complain
about
the
price.
the
tax
is
on
the
actual
purchase
price
of
property.
we
should
submit
that
the
court
should
give
short
shift
to
the
arguments
of
the
government
in
this
regard.
the
government
in
its
brief,
places
great
emphasis
on
the
two
leading
cases
under
section
514
of
the
soldiers'
and
sailors'
civil
relief
act,
which
were
decided
by
this
court.
they
are
dameron
versus
brodhead,
california
versus
buzard.
both
of
which
are
cited
in
all
of
the
briefs
submitted
to
this
court.
we
submit
however,
than
rather
than
support
the
government's
position.
these
cases
support
the
state's
position.
for
example,
in
dameron
versus
brodhead
which
involved
an
ad
valorem
property
tax
on
the
property
of
a
serviceman
serving
in
colorado,
he
was
a
louisiana
resident
at
that
time.
this
court
in
striking
down
the
ad
valorem
property
tax
stated
“in
fact
though
the
evils
of
potential”
--
and
i
quote,
excuse
me,
from
page
326
of
the
decision.
“in
fact,
though
the
evils
of
multiple
taxation,
may
have
given
rise
to
this
provision,
congress
appears
to
have
chosen
the
broader
technique
of
the
statute
carefully
freeing
servicemen
from
both
income
and
property
taxes
imposed
by
any
state
by
virtue
of
their
presence
there
as
a
result
of
military
orders.
it
saved
the
sole
right
of
taxation
to
the
state
of
original
residence
whether
or
not
that
state
exercise
the
right.”
again,
in
california
versus
buzard,
in
which
the
issue
was
the
arrest,
prosecution
and
conviction
of
captain
buzard
for
driving
an
unregistered
motor
vehicle
on
the
highways
of
california,
this
court
at
page
387
opened
its
decision
with
the
following
paragraph
and
i
quote
again.
“section
514
of
the
soldiers'
and
sailors'
civil
relief
act
of
1940,
56.777
as
amended,
provides
a
nonresident
serviceman
present
in
the
state
in
compliance
with
military
orders
with
a
broad
immunity
from
that
state's
personal
property
and
income
taxation.”
the
2%
license
fee
which
was
involved
in
the
buzard
case
was
a
substitute
for
an
ad
valorem
property
tax
which
california
had
found
difficult
to
administer.
so
then,
both
the
dameron
case,
which
involved
an
ad
valorem
property
tax,
and
in
the
buzard
case
which
involved
a
2%
license
fee
as
substitute
for
an
ad
valorem
tax,
this
court
emphasized
that
it
was
dealing
with
an
immunity
granted
by
congress
from
income
and
property
taxes.
again
at
page
393
of
the
buzard
decision,
this
court
states
and
i
quote,
“the
very
purpose
of
514
--
section
514
in
broadly
frame
a
nonresident
serviceman
from
the
obligation
to
pay
property
and
income
taxes,
was
to
relieve
him
of
the
burden
of
supporting
the
governments
of
the
states
where
he
was
present
solely
in
compliance
with
military
orders.
the
statute
operates
whether
or
not
the
home
state
imposes
or
assesses
such
taxes
against
him.”
again,
the
reference
is
to
property
taxes
and
income
taxes.
the
court,
pardon
me,
the
appellee
in
his
brief
places
great
emphasis
on
this
reference
to
the
buzard
case,
the
latter
statement
concerning
income
and
property
taxes.
he
quotes
it
at
pages
12,
19
and
26
of
the
first
part
of
its
brief.
however,
he
very
conveniently
or
it
very
conveniently
leaves
out
the
reference
to
income
and
property
taxation
so
that
the
out-of-context
phrase
that
is
quoted
by
the
government
at
the
top
of
page
12
is,
and
i
quote
“the
very
purpose
of
section
514
***,
was
to
relieve
***
to
servicemen
of
the
burden
of
supporting
the
governments
of
the
states
where
he
was
present
solely
in
compliance
with
military
orders.”
the
three
asterisks
denote
the
deletion
of
the
reference
to
income
and
property
taxes.
at
pages
19
and
26,
the
same
out-of-context
quote
is
made.
however,
it
is
extremely
interesting
to
note
that
at
page
39
of
the
brief,
which
is
the
second
part,
which
does
not
subscribe
to
the
arguments
in
the
first
part,
a
further
reference
is
made
to
the
case
of
california
versus
buzard.
and
in
this
case,
the
quotation
is
given
in
full,
so
that
the
proper
context
of
the
quotation
is
given
referring
to
income
and
property
taxes.
in
any
event,
we
submit
that
the
two
cases
leave
no
doubt
that
the
opinion
of
this
court
the
immunity
granted
by
congress
was
for
property
and
income
taxes,
and
not
sales
and
use
taxes.
at
page
37
of
its
brief,
in
note
27,
the
appellee
advances
a
novel
argument
that
servicemen
who
are
on
furlough
are
no
longer
absent
from
their
home
state
by
virtue
of
military
orders.
in
effect,
this
means
that
a
texas
serviceman
stationed
in
connecticut
who
was
given
a
three-day
pass,
as
soon
as
he
is
given
the
three-day
pass
his
status
immediately
changes
so
that
he
becomes
subject
to
sales
and
use
taxes
in
connecticut
and
in
any
other
state
that
he
might
visit
on
his
furlough
under
the
decision
of
our
lower
court
in
this
case.
at
the
end
of
his
furlough,
the
mantle
of
tax
immunity
immediately
falls
on
his
shoulders,
and
he
again
becomes
immune
from
sales
and
use
taxes
until
he
obtains
his
next
furlough
from
his
commanding
officer.
this,
we
submit
is
adding
confusion
to
an
already
confusing
situation.
the
effect
of
the
lower
court
decision
as
we
view
it
is
to
foster
a
discriminatory
situation
which
we
claim
is
itself
unconstitutional.
for
example,
california
at
page
2
of
its
amicus
brief
states
that
there
are
345,000
servicemen
stationed
at
the
various
bases
in
california.
of
that
number,
45,000
of
the
servicemen
are
california
residents,
300,000
are
nonresidents.
yet,
in
the
purchase
of
tangible
personal
property,
anywhere
in
california,
the
45,000
resident
servicemen
are
required
to
pay
sales
and
use
taxes,
while
the
300,000
nonresident
servicemen
purchasing
the
same
items
for
their
personal
use
are
not
obliged
to
pay
sales
and
use
taxes
under
the
rationale
of
the
above
decision.
we
submit
that
this
is
built-in
discrimination.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
that's
correct
justice
white.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
as
long
as
the
exchange
is
on
a
military
base,
military
enclave
with
pxs
and
the
military
stores.
if
they
choose
to
buy
an
item
at
a
corner
grocery
store
or
corner
drugstore,
they
pay
the
tax.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
no,
i
believe
it's
a
decision
of
this
court
that
the
post
exchanges
are
agencies
of
the
federal
government
for
the
purposes
of
waging
war
and
its
supporting
armies.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
i
don't
believe
it
is
justice
white.
i
believe
it's
by
court
decision,
which
satisfies
me,
i
might
add.
the
appellee
in
this
case
attempts
to
minimize
the
difficulties
which
might
arise
if
the
lower
court
decision
is
not
reversed.
we
submit
that
the
fact
that
34
other
states
have
joined
connecticut
in
support
of
its
position
in
this
case
is
overwhelming
evidence
of
the
seriousness
of
this
situation.
certainly,
the
tax
administrators
and
the
attorneys
general
of
these
34
states
are
competent
to
determine
the
effects
of
the
decision
on
tax
revenues
and
tax
administration
in
the
various
states.
the
main
thrust
of
appellee's
argument
is
to
the
effect
that
the
addition
of
just
four
words
after
the
words
“personal
property”
in
section
514
that
is
“for
the
use
thereof”,
clearly
shows
an
intention
on
the
part
of
congress
to
exempt
servicemen
or
grant
immunity
to
servicemen
from
both
the
whole
scheme
of
sales
and
use
taxation.
we
submit
that
this
is
not
a
proper
application
of
the,
pardon
me,
this
is
not
a
proper
subscription
to
congress
in
view
of
the
fact
that
it's
been
silent
as
to
this
intent.
to
accommodate
the
appellee,
all
congress
had
to
do
was
to
say
that
a
serviceman
was
immune
from
all
taxation
in
any
state
but
his
home
state,
except
taxation
as
to
real
property
and
the
operation
of
a
business.
but
this
congress
did
not
choose
to
do.
and
we
submit
that
if
any
changes
to
be
made
in
this
sensitive
area
that
this
court
let
congress
make
the
decision.
connecticut
and
its
officials
are
not
unmindful
of
the
sacrifices
and
services
being
rendered
by
our
servicemen
both
home
and
abroad.
and
if
the
burden
of
taxation
is
so
great
that
it
warrants
relief,
then
we
submit
they
should
receive
it.
however,
we
feel
that
congress
should
give
them
affirmative
relief
in
the
form
of
a
pay
increase
or
exemption
from
federal
income
taxes.
not
by
seeking
to
have
this
court,
by
judicial
fiat
and
using
inferences
and
implications,
expand
the
provisions
of
section
514
to
encompass
sales
and
use
taxes
when
this
was
not
the
congressional
intent.
thank
you.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
i
have
nothing
further
to
add
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
appeal
has
been
taken
by
state
of
connecticut
from
a
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit,
affirming
a
lower
court
ruling.
that
ruling
held
that
the
application
of
sales
and
use
taxes
to
the
purchase
and
use
of
property
by
non-resident
servicemen
in
connecticut
to
be
in
contravention
of
section
514
of
the
soldiers'
and
sailors'
civil
relief
act.
this
case
was
instituted
by
an
able
lieutenant
named
schuman,
and
the
united
states
of
america
in
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
connecticut,
claiming
immunity
from
the
application
of
the
tax
to
a
boat,
a
pleasure
boat
purchased
by
lieutenant
schuman
in
connecticut,
on
the
basis
that
section
514
of
the
soldiers'
and
sailors'
relief
act
granted
that
immunity
from
sales
taxes.
the
district
court
dismissed
the
claim
of
schuman
for
lack
of
jurisdiction
from
which
no
appeal
has
been
taken.
it
granted
summary
judgment
to
the
united
states
which
judgment
was
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals
on
july
10,
1968.
notice
of
intent
to
appeal
was
filed
july
30th,
the
case
was
docketed
on
october
7th
and
this
court
noted
probable
jurisdiction
on
january
13,
1969.
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court
rests
on
28
u.s.c.
1254
subsection
(2).
i
should
like
to
state
at
this
time
that
the
state
of
texas
has
filed
an
amicus
brief
in
which
30
other
states
have
joined.
the
state
of
new
york
and
the
state
of
california
had
each
filed
independent
amicus
briefs.
illinois
has
joined
california
in
its
brief.
we
commend
these
briefs
to
the
court,
and
thank
the
states
for
their
interests
and
efforts
on
our
behalf,
and
at
the
same
time,
i
should
like
to
commend
to
the
court
the
second
part
of
the
brief
of
the
appellee
in
this
case,
the
united
states
of
america,
starting
at
page
37
through
43,
which
does
not
subscribe
to
the
arguments
which
are
represented
in
the
first
part
of
the
brief.
the
issues
in
this
case
are
whether
the
lower
court
heard
in
determining
that
section
514
of
the
soldiers'
and
sailors'
civil
relief
act
prohibits
the
application
of
sales
and
use
taxes
to
the
private
purchase
transactions
of
servicemen
stationed
in
the
states
throughout
the
country
under
military
orders.
and
further,
whether
section
514
as
interpreted
by
the
court
of
appeals
is
an
unconstitutional
infringement
on
the
reserved
powers
of
the
states
to
tax,
under
article
x
of
the
united
states
constitution.
the
facts
in
this
case
of
brief,
the
parties
to
the
action
stipulated
that
the
everyday
purchases
of
tangible
personal
property
by
servicemen,
are
made
at
pxs
on
military
installations
and
are
therefore
not
subject
to
taxation.
so
they
are
not
a
part
of
this
case.
this
case
is
involved
with
purchases
of
larger
items
by
servicemen
such
as
pleasure
boats,
cars,
television
sets
and
so
forth
which
they
can
not
get
at
pxs.
in
the
lower
court,
the
district
court,
the
united
states
government
presented
several
affidavits
which
allegedly
set
forth
facts
illustrative
of
the
situations
in
which
the
state
of
connecticut
was
assessing
sales
or
use
taxes
against
servicemen
in
connecticut.
i
should
like
to
address
myself
to
one
of
those
affidavits
at
this
time.
it's
the
affidavit
of
commander
william
foster
which
is
printed
in
the
record
appendix
at
page
21
(a)
through
27
(a).
commander
foster
was
a
texas
domiciliary
stationed
in
connecticut
who
purchased
a
car
from
a
connecticut
retail
dealer
and
paid
the
tax
thereon.
commander
foster
in
his
affidavit
claims
to
have
paid
a
use
tax
on
the
transaction.
that
statement
is
in
error.
at
page
6
and
at
page
23
of
the
government
brief
--
government's
brief,
it
refers
to
the
commander
foster
affidavit,
and
on
each
instance
it
states
that
commander
foster
paid
a
use
tax
to
the
state
of
connecticut.
these
statements
are
in
error.
the
purchase
by
commander
foster
was
from
a
connecticut
retail
dealer.
the
sale
took
place
within
the
state
and
he
paid
his
sales
tax
to
the
dealer.
i
direct
the
court's
attention
to
page
27
(a)
of
the
record
appendix
on
which
it
reproduced
the
invoice
covering
the
transaction.
and
on
the
invoice,
it
very
plainly
states
sales
taxes
were
paid
to
the
dealer.
and
significantly,
at
page
41
of
the
government's
brief,
and
this
is
in
the
second
part
which
doesn't
agree
with
the
first
part,
a
reference
is
made
to
this
affidavit.
and
the
reference
is
that
commander
foster
paid
a
sales
tax
to
the
state
of
connecticut.
in
this
connection
also,
my
friends
from
the
attorney
general's
office
in
the
state
of
texas
tell
me
that
i've
committed
a
grievous
error
in
my
brief
at
page
6,
wherein
i
refer
to
commander
foster's
affidavit
and
state
that
after
paying
sales
tax
to
the
state
of
connecticut,
commander
foster
was
required
to
pay
a
use
tax
to
the
state
of
texas
before
registering
the
vehicle.
the
attorney
general's
office
in
texas
advises
me
that
since
1961,
texas
has
had
a
reciprocity
provision
in
its
statutes
granting
credit
for
any
sales
or
use
taxes
paid
to
another
jurisdiction
on
a
motor
vehicle
which
is
brought
into
connecticut
or
into
texas
for
use
therein.
i
would
ask
this
court
to
take
judicial
notice
of
the
laws
of
the
state
of
texas
in
that
regard.
one
final
reference
to
the
foster
affidavit,
in
the
lower
court,
when
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
was
heard,
the
government
presented
three
affidavits
to
the
court
for
its
consideration.
one
of
these
was
the
affidavit
of
commander
foster.
at
that
time,
i
filed
a
motion
to
strike
the
affidavit
from
the
record
on
the
basis
that
commander
foster
had
arrived
at
the
misapprehension
that
he
had
paid
a
use
tax,
rather
than
a
sales
tax
to
the
retail
dealer.
the
district
court
noted
my
objection,
but
did
not
rule
on
that
objection.
under
the
circumstances,
i
renew
that
objection
at
this
time,
and
claim
that
the
court
erred
and
not
ruling
on
the
motion.
and
i
would
ask
that
this
court
disregard
the
foster
affidavit
and
its
deliberations.
i
would
like
to
emphasize
to
this
court
that
this
is
a
case
of
first
impression
before
the
court.
in
the
last
25
years,
since
the
1944
amendment
to
the
soldiers'
and
sailors'
civil
relief
act,
no
claim
has
been
advanced
that
section
514
encompassed
sales
and
use
taxes.
it
wasn't
until
april
of
1967
when
this
case
was
filed
in
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
connecticut
that
the
claim
was
made
that
section
514
encompassed
sales
and
use
taxes.
so
that
this
is
the
first
opportunity
any
court
has
had
to
consider
the
issue.
it
is
the
position
of
the
state
of
connecticut
that
section
514
was
designed
and
intended
by
congress
to
grant
immunity
to
servicemen
from
property
taxes,
income
taxes
and
certain
annual
motor
vehicle
taxes
in
any
state
but
its
home
state
--
his
home
state.
the
statute
accomplishes
this
by
removing
the
jurisdictional
grounds
for
the
imposition
of
those
taxes.
that
is
residence,
domicile,
and
situs
of
the
property.
the
legislative
history
of
section
514
and
the
1944
amendment
and
the
1962
amendment
thereto
supports
this
position.
in
the
legislative
history
of
this
section
and
the
clarifying
amendments,
and
that's
what
they
were
characterized
at
the
time
they
were
proposed
to
congress
as
clarifying
amendments,
not
a
broadening
of
the
tax
immunity
already
granted
by
congress.
the
committee
hearings
and
the
reports
of
committees
contain
not
one
single
reference
to
sales
and
use
taxes.
however,
those
committee
hearings
and
the
reports
are
replete
with
references
to
income
and
property
taxes.
we
submit
to
the
court
that
the
silence
of
the
committee
hearings
and
the
silence
of
congress
as
to
sales
and
use
taxes
is
indicative
of
the
intention
congress
in
this
regard.
it
might
be
pointed
out
too
to
the
court
that
in
1940,
the
buck
act
was
passed
which
specifically
granted
the
states
the
rights
to
collect
sales
and
use
taxes
on
transactions
taking
place
on
federal
enclaves.
so
that
congress
was
well
aware
of
the
sales
and
use
tax
phase
of
taxation
at
the
time
it
passed
section
514
and
its
amendments.
it
is
interesting
to
know
that
the
district
of
columbia
which
is
governed
by
a
sub-committee
of
congress,
i
understand,
has
had
a
sales
and
use
tax
on
its
books
since
1949,
at
a
period
of
about
20
years
and
just
two
years
less
than
the
state
of
connecticut
has
had
its
tax.
the
government
in
the
lower
court
and
in
its
argument
and
in
this
court
is
strangely
silent
as
to
the
position
taken
by
the
taxing
officials
of
the
district
of
columbia
in
this
regard.
now,
certainly
if
any
taxing
officials
in
the
united
states
should
be
aware
of
the
intention
of
congress
and
the
mood
of
congress,
it
would
be
the
taxing
officials
of
the
district
of
columbia.
i
think
from
the
silence
in
this
regard,
we
can
infer
that
the
district
of
columbia
does
not
grant
tax
immunity
on
sales
and
use
taxes
on
the
purchases
of
servicemen
in
this
area.
we
submit
that
the
lower
court
erred
when
it
equated
a
sales
tax
to
a
property
tax
in
its
decision.
the
only
reason
for
equating
it
to
a
property
tax
was
that
the
ultimate
burden
of
the
tax
ultimately
fell
on
the
consumer.
we
submit
that
this
is
true
of
almost
any
tax
that
the
ultimate
burden
will
fall
on
the
consumer.
that
is
hardly
a
reason
for
equating
two
distinct
types
of
taxes.
the
court
of
appeals
compounded
this
error
by
following
the
same
reasoning.
we
submit
to
this
court
that
a
sales
tax
is
not
a
property
tax,
and
conversely
a
property
tax
is
not
a
sales
tax.
a
property
tax
difference
from
a
sales
tax
and
that
it
is
a
recurrent
annual
demand
based
on
capital
value
of
property.
whereas
a
sales
tax
is
based
on
the
purchase
price
or
the
--
it's
based
on
the
cost
of
acquisition
or
the
purchase
price
of
property.
and
it
is
only
taxed
one
time
at
the
date
of
acquisition
of
that
property.
a
property
tax
is
an
ad
valorem
tax.
and
in
51
american
jurisprudence
at
page
53,
which
is
not
in
my
brief,
section
26
it
states
it
very
succinctly
and
i'd
like
to
read
or
quote
for
the
court.
“an
ad
valorem
tax
is
a
tax
on
a
fixed
proportion
of
the
value
of
property
with
respect
to
which
the
tax
is
assessed
and
requires
the
intervention
of
assessors
or
appraisers
to
estimate
the
value
of
such
property
before
the
amount
due
from
each
taxpayer
may
be
determined.”
to
that
definition
must
be
added
that
the
statutes
provide
a
means
of
appeal
from
the
assessed
valuation
placed
on
property
by
an
assessor
to
a
board
of
tax
review
and
ultimately
to
the
courts.
so
that
an
owner
of
property
being
assessed
by
a
tax
assessor
has
recourse
to
a
board
of
tax
review
and
the
courts.
the
appellee
concedes
the
difference
between
a
property
tax
and
a
sales
tax
in
his
brief
at
page
20.
but
he
argues
that
such
difference
should
not
be
of
real
consequence
in
this
case.
we
strongly
disagree.
at
page
14
of
its
brief
also,
it
claims
that
congress
intended
that
the
tax
exemption
should
be
applied
to
any
tax
which
is
measured
by
the
value
of
property,
and
in
the
sales
tax
area,
the
value
is
the
purchase
price.
with
this
we
must
also
strongly
disagree.
the
value
in
taxation
or
the
word
value
in
taxation
is
peculiarly
applicable
to
personal
property
taxation.
it
does
not
have
the
same
meaning
as
purchase
price
in
sales
taxation.
as
stated
earlier,
an
ad
valorem
taxation
of
property,
a
value
is
placed
on
property
by
an
assessor
who
is
usually
a
public
official
before
the
tax
is
levied.
and
the
owner
of
the
property
has
the
right
of
appeal
to
the
board
of
tax
review
or
to
the
courts
for
relief
from
the
amount
of
the
assessment.
in
the
sales
and
use
tax
area,
the
tax
is
based
on
the
purchased
price
of
property.
the
purchase
price
is
set
at
the
whim
of
the
retailer,
and
if
the
purchaser
wants
the
property,
he
pays
the
purchase
price
without
recourse
to
anyone.
if
i
may
give
a
concrete
example
of
the
two
taxes,
i
would
suggest
that
we
let
represent
or
let
represent
two
neighbors
in
a
given
community
and
label
them
a
and
b.
each
owns
the
same
model
and
year
automobile.
for
local
property
tax
purposes
the
tax
assessor
places
a's
automobile
on
the
tax
list
at
the
value
of
$2,000.00.
he
places
b's
car
on
the
list
at
$4,000.00.
in
this
case,
b
has
recourse
to
the
board
of
tax
review
and
the
courts
to
have
his
valuation
of
$4,000.00
reduced
to
equalize
his
pays
with
a.
in
the
same
manner,
when
a
and
b
acquired
these
vehicles,
a
very
well
might
have
had
connections
in
the
automotive
field
which
allowed
him
to
buy
the
automobile
at
the
wholesale
price
of
$3,000.00.
the
sales
tax
would
apply
to
the
purchase
price
of
$3,000.00.
in
the
same
manner,
b
who
didn't
have
the
same
connections
might
have
to
pay
the
full
retail
price
of
$5,000.00.
in
this
case,
the
sales
tax
would
be
applied
to
the
$5,000.00
figure
and
neither
b
nor
a
could
complain
about
the
price.
the
tax
is
on
the
actual
purchase
price
of
property.
we
should
submit
that
the
court
should
give
short
shift
to
the
arguments
of
the
government
in
this
regard.
the
government
in
its
brief,
places
great
emphasis
on
the
two
leading
cases
under
section
514
of
the
soldiers'
and
sailors'
civil
relief
act,
which
were
decided
by
this
court.
they
are
dameron
versus
brodhead,
california
versus
buzard.
both
of
which
are
cited
in
all
of
the
briefs
submitted
to
this
court.
we
submit
however,
than
rather
than
support
the
government's
position.
these
cases
support
the
state's
position.
for
example,
in
dameron
versus
brodhead
which
involved
an
ad
valorem
property
tax
on
the
property
of
a
serviceman
serving
in
colorado,
he
was
a
louisiana
resident
at
that
time.
this
court
in
striking
down
the
ad
valorem
property
tax
stated
“in
fact
though
the
evils
of
potential”
--
and
i
quote,
excuse
me,
from
page
326
of
the
decision.
“in
fact,
though
the
evils
of
multiple
taxation,
may
have
given
rise
to
this
provision,
congress
appears
to
have
chosen
the
broader
technique
of
the
statute
carefully
freeing
servicemen
from
both
income
and
property
taxes
imposed
by
any
state
by
virtue
of
their
presence
there
as
a
result
of
military
orders.
it
saved
the
sole
right
of
taxation
to
the
state
of
original
residence
whether
or
not
that
state
exercise
the
right.”
again,
in
california
versus
buzard,
in
which
the
issue
was
the
arrest,
prosecution
and
conviction
of
captain
buzard
for
driving
an
unregistered
motor
vehicle
on
the
highways
of
california,
this
court
at
page
387
opened
its
decision
with
the
following
paragraph
and
i
quote
again.
“section
514
of
the
soldiers'
and
sailors'
civil
relief
act
of
1940,
56.777
as
amended,
provides
a
nonresident
serviceman
present
in
the
state
in
compliance
with
military
orders
with
a
broad
immunity
from
that
state's
personal
property
and
income
taxation.”
the
2%
license
fee
which
was
involved
in
the
buzard
case
was
a
substitute
for
an
ad
valorem
property
tax
which
california
had
found
difficult
to
administer.
so
then,
both
the
dameron
case,
which
involved
an
ad
valorem
property
tax,
and
in
the
buzard
case
which
involved
a
2%
license
fee
as
substitute
for
an
ad
valorem
tax,
this
court
emphasized
that
it
was
dealing
with
an
immunity
granted
by
congress
from
income
and
property
taxes.
again
at
page
393
of
the
buzard
decision,
this
court
states
and
i
quote,
“the
very
purpose
of
514
--
section
514
in
broadly
frame
a
nonresident
serviceman
from
the
obligation
to
pay
property
and
income
taxes,
was
to
relieve
him
of
the
burden
of
supporting
the
governments
of
the
states
where
he
was
present
solely
in
compliance
with
military
orders.
the
statute
operates
whether
or
not
the
home
state
imposes
or
assesses
such
taxes
against
him.”
again,
the
reference
is
to
property
taxes
and
income
taxes.
the
court,
pardon
me,
the
appellee
in
his
brief
places
great
emphasis
on
this
reference
to
the
buzard
case,
the
latter
statement
concerning
income
and
property
taxes.
he
quotes
it
at
pages
12,
19
and
26
of
the
first
part
of
its
brief.
however,
he
very
conveniently
or
it
very
conveniently
leaves
out
the
reference
to
income
and
property
taxation
so
that
the
out-of-context
phrase
that
is
quoted
by
the
government
at
the
top
of
page
12
is,
and
i
quote
“the
very
purpose
of
section
514
***,
was
to
relieve
***
to
servicemen
of
the
burden
of
supporting
the
governments
of
the
states
where
he
was
present
solely
in
compliance
with
military
orders.”
the
three
asterisks
denote
the
deletion
of
the
reference
to
income
and
property
taxes.
at
pages
19
and
26,
the
same
out-of-context
quote
is
made.
however,
it
is
extremely
interesting
to
note
that
at
page
39
of
the
brief,
which
is
the
second
part,
which
does
not
subscribe
to
the
arguments
in
the
first
part,
a
further
reference
is
made
to
the
case
of
california
versus
buzard.
and
in
this
case,
the
quotation
is
given
in
full,
so
that
the
proper
context
of
the
quotation
is
given
referring
to
income
and
property
taxes.
in
any
event,
we
submit
that
the
two
cases
leave
no
doubt
that
the
opinion
of
this
court
the
immunity
granted
by
congress
was
for
property
and
income
taxes,
and
not
sales
and
use
taxes.
at
page
37
of
its
brief,
in
note
27,
the
appellee
advances
a
novel
argument
that
servicemen
who
are
on
furlough
are
no
longer
absent
from
their
home
state
by
virtue
of
military
orders.
in
effect,
this
means
that
a
texas
serviceman
stationed
in
connecticut
who
was
given
a
three-day
pass,
as
soon
as
he
is
given
the
three-day
pass
his
status
immediately
changes
so
that
he
becomes
subject
to
sales
and
use
taxes
in
connecticut
and
in
any
other
state
that
he
might
visit
on
his
furlough
under
the
decision
of
our
lower
court
in
this
case.
at
the
end
of
his
furlough,
the
mantle
of
tax
immunity
immediately
falls
on
his
shoulders,
and
he
again
becomes
immune
from
sales
and
use
taxes
until
he
obtains
his
next
furlough
from
his
commanding
officer.
this,
we
submit
is
adding
confusion
to
an
already
confusing
situation.
the
effect
of
the
lower
court
decision
as
we
view
it
is
to
foster
a
discriminatory
situation
which
we
claim
is
itself
unconstitutional.
for
example,
california
at
page
2
of
its
amicus
brief
states
that
there
are
345,000
servicemen
stationed
at
the
various
bases
in
california.
of
that
number,
45,000
of
the
servicemen
are
california
residents,
300,000
are
nonresidents.
yet,
in
the
purchase
of
tangible
personal
property,
anywhere
in
california,
the
45,000
resident
servicemen
are
required
to
pay
sales
and
use
taxes,
while
the
300,000
nonresident
servicemen
purchasing
the
same
items
for
their
personal
use
are
not
obliged
to
pay
sales
and
use
taxes
under
the
rationale
of
the
above
decision.
we
submit
that
this
is
built-in
discrimination.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
that's
correct
justice
white.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
as
long
as
the
exchange
is
on
a
military
base,
military
enclave
with
pxs
and
the
military
stores.
if
they
choose
to
buy
an
item
at
a
corner
grocery
store
or
corner
drugstore,
they
pay
the
tax.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
no,
i
believe
it's
a
decision
of
this
court
that
the
post
exchanges
are
agencies
of
the
federal
government
for
the
purposes
of
waging
war
and
its
supporting
armies.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
i
don't
believe
it
is
justice
white.
i
believe
it's
by
court
decision,
which
satisfies
me,
i
might
add.
the
appellee
in
this
case
attempts
to
minimize
the
difficulties
which
might
arise
if
the
lower
court
decision
is
not
reversed.
we
submit
that
the
fact
that
34
other
states
have
joined
connecticut
in
support
of
its
position
in
this
case
is
overwhelming
evidence
of
the
seriousness
of
this
situation.
certainly,
the
tax
administrators
and
the
attorneys
general
of
these
34
states
are
competent
to
determine
the
effects
of
the
decision
on
tax
revenues
and
tax
administration
in
the
various
states.
the
main
thrust
of
appellee's
argument
is
to
the
effect
that
the
addition
of
just
four
words
after
the
words
“personal
property”
in
section
514
that
is
“for
the
use
thereof”,
clearly
shows
an
intention
on
the
part
of
congress
to
exempt
servicemen
or
grant
immunity
to
servicemen
from
both
the
whole
scheme
of
sales
and
use
taxation.
we
submit
that
this
is
not
a
proper
application
of
the,
pardon
me,
this
is
not
a
proper
subscription
to
congress
in
view
of
the
fact
that
it's
been
silent
as
to
this
intent.
to
accommodate
the
appellee,
all
congress
had
to
do
was
to
say
that
a
serviceman
was
immune
from
all
taxation
in
any
state
but
his
home
state,
except
taxation
as
to
real
property
and
the
operation
of
a
business.
but
this
congress
did
not
choose
to
do.
and
we
submit
that
if
any
changes
to
be
made
in
this
sensitive
area
that
this
court
let
congress
make
the
decision.
connecticut
and
its
officials
are
not
unmindful
of
the
sacrifices
and
services
being
rendered
by
our
servicemen
both
home
and
abroad.
and
if
the
burden
of
taxation
is
so
great
that
it
warrants
relief,
then
we
submit
they
should
receive
it.
however,
we
feel
that
congress
should
give
them
affirmative
relief
in
the
form
of
a
pay
increase
or
exemption
from
federal
income
taxes.
not
by
seeking
to
have
this
court,
by
judicial
fiat
and
using
inferences
and
implications,
expand
the
provisions
of
section
514
to
encompass
sales
and
use
taxes
when
this
was
not
the
congressional
intent.
thank
you.
mr.
f.
michael
ahern
i
have
nothing
further
to
add
mr.
chief
justice.
