mr.
stanley
a.
bass
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
from
an
order
of
the
three-judge
court
in
chicago,
dismissing
a
suit
for
declaratory
judgment
and
injunction.
the
suit
was
filed
by
two
pre-trial
detainees
from
chicago,
cook
county
jail,
on
behalf
of
themselves
and
all
of
the
persons
similarly
situated
who
are
registered
qualified
voters
but
who
are
unable
to
get
to
the
polls
on
election
date
because
they
are
incarcerated,
either
without
bail
or
because
they
lack
the
funds
to
post
to
monetary
bail.
the
suit
sought
a
judgment
declaring
that
the
illinois
--
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
that's
correct.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
correct.
the
suits
sought
a
judgment
declaring
that
the
illinois
statutes
applicable
to
absentee
voting
are
unconstitutional
and
so
far
as
they
preclude
the
granting
of
absentee
ballots
to
pre-trial
detainees
confined
in
the
county
of
their
residents.
a
timely
notice
of
appeal
was
filed
from
the
judgement
of
the
district
court.
the
jurisdictional
statement
was
filed
in
february.
in
april,
this
court
grants
a
leave
to
proceed
in
0139
and
postponed
the
issue
of
jurisdiction
until
the
hearing
on
the
merits.
so,
i
will
turn
first
to
the
issue
of
jurisdiction.
under
section
1253
of
title
28,
appeals
lie
directly
to
the
supreme
court
from
an
order
denying
an
injunction
and
a
civil
action
which
is
required
to
be
heard
by
a
three-judge
court.
we
therefore
turn
to
section
2281
of
the
judicial
code
which
provides
the
three-judge
district
court
is
required
where
an
injunction
is
sought
to
restrain
the
enforcement,
operation,
or
execution
of
a
state
statute
by
restraining
the
action
of
an
officer
of
the
state.
so
there
are
three
ingredients
here.
first,
that
injunction
must
be
sought,
that
was
true
in
this
case.
second,
that
there
is
a
state
statute
or
general
state
wide
application.
that's
what
we
have
in
this
case.
third,
that
we
have
a
state
officer
or
pursuant
to
the
decisions
of
this
court,
a
local
officer
functioning
pursuant
to
a
state
wide
policy
performing
a
state
function.
now
under
illinois
law,
as
far
as
absentee
ballots
are
concerned,
the
chicago
board
of
election
commissioners
has
the
same
responsibility
as
the
county
clerk
in
another
county
or
anybody
else
who
was
charged
with
the
duty
of
furnishing
absentee
ballots.
indeed,
section
19-2
of
the
election
code
which
appears
on
page
15
of
our
brief
states
on
the
ninth
line
of
the
provision
that
the
elector
make
application
to
the
county
clerk
or
were
existing
to
the
board
of
election
commissioners
or
other
officer
or
officers
charged
with
the
duty
of
furnishing
ballots
for
such
election
in
his
voting
district.
so
that
the
fact
that
the
board
of
election
commissioners
here
are
the
defendants
is
not
relevant
because
their
function
is
a
state
wide
function,
they
perform
the
same
function
with
respect
to
absentee
ballots
as
the
officers
in
the
other
counties
and
localities.
nor
is
this
case
moot
at
this
time.
it
is
true
that
the
two
named
representative
plaintiffs
are
not
in
the
cook
county
jail
awaiting
trial.
mr.
byrd
was
discharged
a
week
after
the
election
at
his
preliminary
hearing
and
mr.
mcdonald
went
to
trial,
it
was
a
hang
jury
and
he
subsequently
pleaded
to
a
reduce
charge
of
manslaughter
which
is
a
bailable
offense.
however,
since
this
is
a
class
action
and
was
found
to
be
so
by
the
trial
court
and
i
referred
to
page
30
of
the
record,
where
the
three-judge
court
says
plaintiffs
and
the
class
they
represent
are.
the
fact
that
this
is
a
class
action
means
that
the
fact
that
the
named
plaintiffs
are
not
members
of
the
class
a
more
is
not
fatal
as
this
court
indicated
a
month
after
the
jurisdictional
statement
was
filed
to
this
case
and
the
case
was
lee
versus
washington
which
involved
the
desegregation
of
the
alabama
jails.
this
court
--
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
no
effort
has
made
--
was
made
to
name
any
persons
but
i
presume
and
i
would
respectfully
ask
the
court
to
respect
the
judgement
of
the
district
court
that
this
was
a
class
action
and
that
there
are
in
the
county
jail
prior
to
each
election,
a
certain
number
of
persons
for
which
--
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
what
is
it
at
this
moment?
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
well,
mr.
justice
marshall,
the
problem
is
that
the
class
really
cannot
be
seen
very
clearly
until
right
before
an
election
because
it's
very
difficult
to
predict
exactly
who
will
be
a
pre-trial
detainee
on
the
day
of
election.
one
could
ascertain
with
some
degree
of
certainty
perhaps
that
we
go
to
before
the
election
exactly
which
persons,
which
named
persons
would
be
pre-trial
detainees
unable
to
get
to
the
polls
on
election
day
and
because
this
class
is
rather
fluid,
it's
really
impossible
to
identify
any
names
except
right
before
an
election
but
i
think
the
three-judge
court
below
recognized
that
there
surely
must
be
a
number
of
persons
who
are
registered
qualified
voters
in
jail
on
the
day
of
election.
incidentally,
the
cook
county
jail
has
about
1800
inmates,
2/3
of
which
awaiting
trial,
so
that
then
there
must
be
some
number
of
person
although
they
cannot
be
identified
except
right
near
an
election.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
vague
questions
because
--
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
that's
correct.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
and
we're
not
attacking
that
provision
on
making
application
within
a
certain
amount
of
time
as
being
--
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
yes.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
well,
it's
a
reasonable
provision.
i
don't
think
that
there
is
anything
unreasonable
about
requiring
submissions
perhaps
to
do
ballots
to
be
made
in
a
certain
time
because
there
are
some
administers.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
well,
i'm
not
assailing
the
provisions
regarding
time.
we
are
assailing
the
substantive
provisions
as
to
who
can
take
the
ballot.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
that's
correct.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
i
will
turn
to
that.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
no,
they're
unconvicted.
we
use
the
word
unsentenced
a
few
times
but
the
--
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
the
--
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
there
was
some
loose
language,
we
intended
and
was
clear
but
the
time
were
litigating
this,
we
were
dealing
with
the
pre-trial
detainees
rather
than
persons
who
were
between
that
period
of
conviction
and
sentence.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
well
frankly,
i
would
like
to
allude
to
an
argument
which
might
be
considered
a
due
process
one
i
haven't
raised
it
the
brief
but
we
raised
it
with
respect
to
answering
the
board
of
election
commissioners
argument
about
the
fact
that
persons
who
can
be
deprived
of
liberty
cannot
assert
privilege.
in
other
words,
if
it
is
a
due
process
argument,
it
would
be
that
the
mere
fact
the
person
is
detained
prior
to
trial
does
not
mean
that
he
could
be
deprived
the
all
rights.
i
would
like
to
turn
to
the
merits
of
the
case
at
this
time.
this
case
was
originally
argued
on
a
rational
basis
test
but
recently
this
court
decided
the
williams
versus
rhodes
which
seems
to
have
put
the
right
to
vote
on
a
first
amendment
basis
and
it
appears
to
us
that
williams
versus
rhodes
makes
clear
that
the
right
to
--
that
there
is
a
relation
between
voting
and
political
expression
which
is
protected
by
the
first
amendment
and
secondly,
that
the
state
must
show
a
compelling
state
interest
in
imposing
heavy
burdens
upon
the
right
to
vote.
now,
in
this
case,
it's
not
very
clear,
it's
not
clear
at
all
whether
there
are
any
legitimate
state
interests
who
are
compelling
to
justify
the
denial
of
the
right
to
vote
to
a
person
whose
awaiting
trial.
it
would
appear
that
the
most
that
the
election
board
could
say
would
be
that
there's
an
administrative
convenience
in
not
having
to
dispense
too
many
absentee
ballots,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
mere
fact
that
it's
a
few
more
absentee
ballots
to
give
out
does
not
justify
deprivation
of
such
a
fundamental
right.
the
board
of
election
commission
has
taken
the
position
in
its
brief
that
voting
is
a
privilege
or
the
voting
by
absentee
ballot
is
a
privilege
rather
than
array.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
by
calling
something
a
privilege
doesn't
mean
that
the
state
can
arbitrarily
deny
it
to
you.
surely,
if
absentee
ballots
were
dispensed
on
the
basis
of
race,
i
don't
think
this
court
would
hesitate
to
say
that
that
would
be
a
denial
of
equal
protection
of
the
law,
merely
because
absentee
balloting
may
be
considered
a
privilege
by
the
state,
and
the
district
court
in
brown
versus
post
which
we
referred
to
in
our
reply
brief
held
that
where
the
board
of
--
where
the
elections
people
went
to
the
nursing
home,
the
white
nursing
homes
and
not
the
black
nursing
homes
that
that
was
a
denial
of
equal
protection
of
the
law
and
in
giving
out
absentee
ballots.
we
submit
that
the
mere
fact
that
there
is
an
absentee
ballot
rather
than
voting
in
person
does
not
justify
such
a
distinction.
now,
the
board
of
election
commissioners
raises
the
question,
“need
prisoners
be
afforded
privileges
when
they
can
be
denied
liberty.”
i
think
this
is
perhaps
the
first
case
that
this
court
has
had
an
opportunity
to
determine,
whether
there
are
any
conditions
or
consequences
of
pretrial
detention
which
may
be
considered
constitutionally
impermissible.
we
must
recognize
that
no
matter
how
much
bail
reform
occurs
there
is
just
going
to
be
a
number
of
people
are
going
to
be
incarcerated
prior
to
trial
and
it
seems
to
me
that
we
must
address
ourselves
to
the
consequences
of
the
pretrial
detention.
i
don't
think
it's
a
basic
proposition
one
could
say
that
the
mere
fact
the
man
is
detained
prior
to
trial
means
you
can
do
anything
you
want
with
him.
i
think
he's
entitled
to
certain
minimum
standards
of
decency.
i
think
that
if
the
state
attempts
to
deny
certain
basic
rights,
they
must
show
a
compelling
interest.
now,
what
kind
of
compelling
interest
might
be
shown?
perhaps
institutions
have
certain
rules
regarding
persons
who
visit.
considerations
of
institutional
security
of
course
are
parallel.
i
think
this
court
in
lee
versus
washington
indicated
that
it's
decision
in
no
way
suggested
that
the
warden
couldn't
make
allowances
for
institutional
security.
but
nowhere
in
the
record
of
this
case
or
in
any
case
have
i
ever
heard
that
inmate
voting
by
absentee
ballots
or
some
--
have
--
going
to
disrupt
the
routine
of
an
institution.
there's
nothing
to
suggest
that
it
does.
i
think
common
sense
would
suggest
that
perhaps
morale
would
be
a
lift
when
somebody
votes
from
behind
bars.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
yes
i
did,
i
made
a
state
by
state
canvass.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
well,
i
found
out
that
--
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
every
state
grants
absentee
ballots
to
the
servicemen
who
are
abroad.
two
states
seem
to
recognize
the
right
of
prisoners
to
vote.
both
of
these
states
i
have
opinions
of
the
attorney
general
but
i
found
no
cases.
most
--
excuse
me.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
most
of
the
states
have
varying
provisions
from
physical
disability
to
absence
from
various
localities.
for
example,
once
--
the
12
states
say
that
if
you'll
be
absent
from
the
precinct,
you
can
get
an
absentee
ballot.
six
states
say
if
you're
absent
from
the
city,
you
get
an
absentee
ballot.
one
state,
louisiana
says
if
you're
absent
from
the
parish,
23
states
say
if
you're
absent
from
the
county,
and
five
states
say
if
you're
absent
from
the
state
on
election
day,
you
can
get
an
absentee
ballot.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
some
of
them
break
it
down
and
say
absence
in
the
county
for
business
reasons.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
that's
for
some
of
them
do.
that's
correct.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
some
do.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
that's
right.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
that's
correct.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
now,
we're
not
--
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
that's
correct.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
that's
right,
illinois
has
an
interesting
classification.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
i
think
maine
says
that.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
i
think
that's
the
only
state
that
does
it.
now,
we're
not
suggesting
that
everybody
who
wants
an
absentee
ballot
can
have
one.
there
are
certain
limitations
which
we
recognize
as
constitutionally.
for
example,
the
mere
fact
that
a
mother
who
has
children
or
a
breadwinner
who
has
a
job
with
long
hours
can't
get
to
the
polls,
may
find
it
inconvenient,
we
feel
that
we're
not
submitting
that
that's
a
denial
of
the
constitution
but
what
we
have
is
something
more
than
that.
we
have
the
state
putting
the
man
into
disability.
they
have
the
state
judge
putting
the
man
in
jail
on
election
day.
and
we
have
another
state
agency
which
refuses
the
ballot
and
together
that's
joint
state
action
which
effectively
deprives
a
man
of
the
rights
to
vote.
so
it
seems
to
me
that
the
situation
of
the
prisoners
can't
be
distinguished
and
any
decision
in
their
favor
would
not
necessarily
have
to
require
that
everybody
in
the
world
get
an
absentee
ballot.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
we
did
not
include
it
on
the
brief
your
honor,
justice
fortas.
i
would
be
glad
to
submit
that
by
way
of
a
supplemental
brief
if
i
think
i
believe
to
do
so.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
i
will.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
in
terms
of
legitimate
state
interest,
perhaps
it
might
be
urged
that
the
takeover
theory
that
all
of
the
inmates
voting
together
might
outweigh
a
community.
but
in
the
first
place,
the
inmates
would
vote
in
the
count
--
in
the
precinct
in
which
they
lived
prior
to
becoming
member
of
the
jail
population
so
that
they
would
not
vote
in
the
precinct
where
the
jail
was
located
but
they
would
be
in
disperse
from
the
various
precincts
in
which
they
come.
in
any
event,
i
think
that
the
takeover
theory
was
rejected
by
this
court
in
the
carrington
case.
now,
we
would
submit
that
the
--
that
this
case
can
be
decided
on
a
number
of
theories.
one
theory
would
be
that
the
granting
of
the
absentee
ballot
to
a
person
who
is
jailed
in
another
county
or
denial
of
an
absentee
ballot
of
a
person
jailed
in
the
county
of
his
residence
is
absolutely
irrational.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
that's
correct,
that's
my
second
theory.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
that's
my
second
theory
that
this
case
goes
off
on
the
fact
that
the
state
granted
him
unable
to
get
to
the
polls.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
well,
the
first
one
is
that
the
classifications
that
the
state
of
illinois
has
employed
are
not
rational
or
based
upon
compelling
state
interest.
that
is
that
the
board
of
election
commissioners
or
the
state
has
failed
to
show
in
what
respect
is
a
legitimate
state
interest
that
requires
the
denial
of
absentee
ballots
to
this
--
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
well,
i
would
say
yes
except
using
the
compelling
state
interest
theory
that
the
state
would
probably
be
able
to
show
in
a
large
number
of
those
situations
involving
their
inconvenience
rather
than
impossibility
that
there
is
a
legitimate
--
that
there
is
a
compelling
state
interest,
whereas
in
this
case,
i
don't
think
that
they
can
show
that.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
physically
incapacitated
i
believe
the
--
about
perhaps
half
of
the
states.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
well,
if
a
man
who
is
physically
incapacitated
and
he
can
produce
a
certificate
of
a
physician
which
the
illinois
statute
requires
and
if
he
is
inside
the
county,
he
can
get
an
absentee
ballot.
these
provision
--
and
also,
if
he
can
show
that
because
of
religious
groups,
he
can
get
--
there
was
also
a
way
--
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
there
was
one
classification
that
was
added
by
the
legislature
at
the
last
minute
which
escape
the
attorney's
and
the
three-judge
court
in
this
case
and
that
was
a
judge
of
election
who
is
working
on
election
day
--
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
--
on
a
precinct
other
than
his
own
but
those
are
the
classes.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
the
veterans?
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
well,
members
of
the
armed
forces.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
correct.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
and
many
other
people
who
are
out
of
the
state?
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
that's
right.
there
use
to
be
a
special
provision
for
servicemen
which
was
article
20
but
since
the
provision
was
added,
anybody
out
of
the
county,
that
automatically
swallowed
up
that
group.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
as
long
as
they're
out
of
the
county
that's
all
at
least
are
required.
the
board
of
election
commissioners
will
give
them
an
absentee
ballot.
and
even
if
a
man
is
in
jail
if
he's
in
the
county
other
than
the
county
of
his
residence,
presumably,
he'll
get
an
absentee
ballot
too.
so
it
seems
to
me
that
it's
difficult
to
say
that
this
refusal
to
give
absentee
ballots
to
these
class
of
persons
is
justified
by
considerations
of
institutional
security,
because
of
that
would
show,
the
legislature
would
have
said
i
hope
that
we
make
a
finding
that
because
of
the
routine
of
the
jail,
it
would
be
so
disruptive
that
no
absentee
ballot
should
go
to
prisons.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
and
those
who'll
be
out
of
the
county.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
that's
correct
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
it's
a
denial
by
implication
rather
than
expressed
denial
but
i
think
that
that
makes
this
case
stronger
because
had
the
legis
--
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
judge
lynch
said
that
he
could.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
judge
lynch
in
the
first
mcdonald
case
said.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
i
would
say
as
to
that
to
--
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
he
might
be
able
to
but
that
does
get
into
that
causation
question
as
to
whether
the
cause
has
in
ability
is
the
fact
that
he
is
sick
or
the
fact
that
he
is
incarcerated.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
i
think
if
he
had
his
physician
certificate
under
those
circumstances
that
the
board
of
election
commissioners
would
probably
give
him
the
ballot.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
i
think
so.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
no,
it
just
bars
those
that
are
well,
that
are
not
religious
that
are
unconsecrated
in
the
county
of
their
own
residence
and
it
seems
to
me
that
that
type
of
classification
doesn't
make
any
sense
and
is
certainly
is
not
justified
by
any
compelling
state
interest.
i
tried
to
figure
out,
if
there
were
any,
i
looked
at
the
brief
of
the
board
of
election
commissioner
as
unable
to
find
any.
it
seems
to
me
what
the
state
of
illinois
is
done
here
and
it
gives
this
court
a
unique
opportunity
to
get
into
the
area
of
absentee
ballots
is
--
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
well,
i
think
that
it's
an
important
one
because
absentee
ballots
have
been
with
us
since
the
civil
war
and
they've
become
a
very
convenient
means
of
voting.
it's
not
like
in
the
old
day
where
it
was
considered
such
a
new
process
that
this
court,
state
courts
was
tracking
them
down.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
well,
they
said
--
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
well,
they
said
in
this
case
that
you
don't
have
the
right
certificate.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
well,
as
i
understand
illinois
law,
it's
true
that
the
provisions
of
absentee
ballots
are
permissive
but
it
seems
to
me
that
--
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
he
said
he
would
be.
i
don't
know
if
there's
any
express
provision
that
says
if
you
give
an
absentee
ballots
to
other
persons
that'll
be
a
violation
of
the
law.
i
think
the
election
board
probably
assumes
that
if
he
gives
ballots
to
persons
other
than
those
named
expressly
that
this
would
be
a
violation
of
illinois
law.
but
as
i
read
the
statutes,
there
is
nothing
that
says,
don't
give
it
to
these
people,
it
just
doesn't
say,
give
it
to
these
people.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
it's
his
next
continued
court
date.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
it's
his
next
continued
court
date
if
that
continued
court
date.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
well
--
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
it's
--
that's
the
same
situation
as
a
person
who
thinks
he's
going
out
of
town
on
business.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
no
you're
not.
it's
only
--
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
he'd
be
similarly
situated.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
yes
it
would
and
it
would
apply
also
to
persons
who
are
convicted
of
civil
crimes,
non
support
or
contempt.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
it's
anything
other
than
conviction
of
a
felony
and
if
--
or
from
this
crime,
you're
not
disenfranchised
explicitly
but
you
do
run
into
the
problems
since
you
can't
get
to
the
polls.
are
you
entitled
to
that
mechanism
which
the
state
of
illinois
has
setup?
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
i
would
say
it
to
the
extent
to
which
the
state
can
show
a
compelling
interest
in
limiting
that
the
number
of
persons
that
can
come
in
campaign,
subject
to
the
certain
restrictions
which
are
atoned
to
the
institutional
framework
that
the
state
can
refuse
certain
rights
of
the
persons
who
want
to
campaign
but
it
seems
to
me
as
a
basic
preposition
is
to
whether
or
not
there
are
any
restraints
at
all.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
state
must
show
that
compelling
state
interest
in
the
case
where
they
seek
to
restrict
a
vote.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
well,
i
would
say
to
the
extent
to
which
he's
really
the
--
really
has
control
over
his
situation
that
that
would
mean,
not
like
the
fact
in
this
situation.
i
recognize
that
there
are
problems
of
judgment
in
determining
when
the
state
has
satisfied
its
burden
of
showing
a
compelling
state
interest.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
where
we
have
persons
like
persons
in
the
army
or
persons
in
jail.
that
person
is
precluded
by
an
official
act
from
getting
to
the
polls
and
he
would
have
to
break
the
law.
he
would
actually
have
to
escape
jail
or
go
awol
in
order
to
try
to
cast
his
vote.
and
we
submit
that
under
those
certain
circumstances,
the
state
must
show
a
very
compelling
interest
in
order
to
justify
giving
him
the
ballot
which
can
be
easily
be
voted
by
mail.
i
wanted
to
add
one
last
matter
and
that
is
that
we
have
a
presumption
of
innocence
under
the
law.
however,
in
reality,
this
presumption
can
be
willed
away
by
a
lot
of
circumstances.
for
example,
we're
beginning
to
discover
that
conditions
of
pretrial
detention
in
very
many
institutions
across
the
country
are
a
lot
lower
standard
than
we
would
consider
human
decency
it
requires.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
unless
this
court
is
willing
to
say
that
there
are
some
limitations,
there
are
some
rights
that
you
just
can't
take
away
from
the
man
merely
because
he's
awaiting
trial.
he's
presumed
to
be
innocent.
in
order
to
give
full
filthy
the
presumption
of
innocence,
the
court
has
got
to
say
that
it
was
a
very
important
right
the
state
must
show
a
compelling
state
interest
in
order
to
deprive
the
man
of
that
right.
i'd
like
to
receive
a
few
moments
of
time
to
--
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
i've
a
short
comment
your
honor.
first
is
to
the
question
about
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus,
i'm
responsible
for
that
phrase
writ
of
habeas
corpus
at
both
tandem,
i
thought
it
was
theoretically
possible
but
i
--
in
discussions
and
this
is
off
the
record
but
i
represent
to
the
court
in
discussions
with
the
chief
judge
of
the
criminal
division
that
whether
persons
could
be
taken
over
is
sort
of
laugh
the
idea
and
didn't
think
it
was
feasible
at
all
to
have
reach
supreme
people
over
--
have
deputy
sheriffs
to
accompany
them
to
the
polls.
with
reference
to
the
legitimate
state
interest
to
prevent
fraud,
i
would
say
that
if
there
where
state
provision
that
said
no
absentee
ballot
for
anybody
in
the
jail
that
would
be
one
thing.
but
presumably
these
ballots
can
be
given
the
persons
in
jail
in
another
county
and
the
likelihood
of
fraud
is
just
as
great
and
--
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
well,
we're
talking
about
the
person
who
lives
in
chicago
--
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
--
who's
caught
out
in
wheaton
--
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
that's
true
but
i
would
indicate
that
the
absentee
ballot
procedure
is
that
one
has
to
cast
the
ballot
in
the
presence
of
a
notary
rebook
outside
the
state
so
that
there
is
a
check
against
fraud
and
finally
i
would
--
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
well,
as
i
indicated
mr.
--
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
it
occurred
to
me
and
when
i
took
that
up
with
chief
judge
of
the
criminal
division
he
indicated
that
it
was
not
a
very
feasible
--
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
no,
we
do
not.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
we
took
the
position
--
realistic
position
that
the
only
way
a
person
in
jail
could
vote
is
by
mail
that
it
would
be
extremely
and
in
positions
on
the
state
to
require
armed
deputy
sheriffs
to
takes
somebody
to
the
polls
and
we
talk
about
--
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
well,
it
seems
on
me
that
--
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
well,
we
would
submit
that
in
terms
of
the
consequences
of
pretrial
detention
that
this
is
an
impermissible
one
and
this
is
--
absentee
balloting
is
the
only
way
we
can
meaningfully
talk
about
a
person
in
jail
voting.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
well,
i
suppose
deputy
sheriff
would
have
to
go
in
there
and
that
would
be
rather
inconsistent
--
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
that
would
certainly
violate
secrecy
which
would
not
be
violated
if
an
absentee
ballot
were
cast
in
jail
with
the
present
of
a
notary.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
well,
i
would
say
this
that
i
made
the
value
judgment
and
i'm
responsible
for
that
that
after
discussing
this
thing
with
the
chief
judge
of
the
criminal
division,
i
felt
that
his
position
was
reasonable
and
that
the
only
way
to
talk
meaningfully
about
voting
is
voting
by
mail
rather
than
in
person.
and
if
the
right
to
vote
by
absentee
ballot
cannot
obtain
--
be
obtained
from
this
court,
i
suppose
we'll
have
to
try
to
exhaust
the
other
possibility
legally
and
see
if
we
could
--
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
no,
that
is
filing
of
petitions
for
writ
habeas
corpus
at
both
tandem
to
see
if
we
can
show
that
the
state
is
foreclosing
all
avenues
of
voting
back
pre-trial
detainees.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
well,
i
don't
know
that's
one
of
the
activities
about
legal
aid
project
is
to
try
to
get
people
interested
in
their
citizenship
rights
because
at
present
they
seems
to
be
more
interested
in
taking
there
grievances
to
the
street
than
to
the
ballot
box.
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
from
an
order
of
the
three-judge
court
in
chicago,
dismissing
a
suit
for
declaratory
judgment
and
injunction.
the
suit
was
filed
by
two
pre-trial
detainees
from
chicago,
cook
county
jail,
on
behalf
of
themselves
and
all
of
the
persons
similarly
situated
who
are
registered
qualified
voters
but
who
are
unable
to
get
to
the
polls
on
election
date
because
they
are
incarcerated,
either
without
bail
or
because
they
lack
the
funds
to
post
to
monetary
bail.
the
suit
sought
a
judgment
declaring
that
the
illinois
--
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
that's
correct.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
correct.
the
suits
sought
a
judgment
declaring
that
the
illinois
statutes
applicable
to
absentee
voting
are
unconstitutional
and
so
far
as
they
preclude
the
granting
of
absentee
ballots
to
pre-trial
detainees
confined
in
the
county
of
their
residents.
a
timely
notice
of
appeal
was
filed
from
the
judgement
of
the
district
court.
the
jurisdictional
statement
was
filed
in
february.
in
april,
this
court
grants
a
leave
to
proceed
in
0139
and
postponed
the
issue
of
jurisdiction
until
the
hearing
on
the
merits.
so,
i
will
turn
first
to
the
issue
of
jurisdiction.
under
section
1253
of
title
28,
appeals
lie
directly
to
the
supreme
court
from
an
order
denying
an
injunction
and
a
civil
action
which
is
required
to
be
heard
by
a
three-judge
court.
we
therefore
turn
to
section
2281
of
the
judicial
code
which
provides
the
three-judge
district
court
is
required
where
an
injunction
is
sought
to
restrain
the
enforcement,
operation,
or
execution
of
a
state
statute
by
restraining
the
action
of
an
officer
of
the
state.
so
there
are
three
ingredients
here.
first,
that
injunction
must
be
sought,
that
was
true
in
this
case.
second,
that
there
is
a
state
statute
or
general
state
wide
application.
that's
what
we
have
in
this
case.
third,
that
we
have
a
state
officer
or
pursuant
to
the
decisions
of
this
court,
a
local
officer
functioning
pursuant
to
a
state
wide
policy
performing
a
state
function.
now
under
illinois
law,
as
far
as
absentee
ballots
are
concerned,
the
chicago
board
of
election
commissioners
has
the
same
responsibility
as
the
county
clerk
in
another
county
or
anybody
else
who
was
charged
with
the
duty
of
furnishing
absentee
ballots.
indeed,
section
19-2
of
the
election
code
which
appears
on
page
15
of
our
brief
states
on
the
ninth
line
of
the
provision
that
the
elector
make
application
to
the
county
clerk
or
were
existing
to
the
board
of
election
commissioners
or
other
officer
or
officers
charged
with
the
duty
of
furnishing
ballots
for
such
election
in
his
voting
district.
so
that
the
fact
that
the
board
of
election
commissioners
here
are
the
defendants
is
not
relevant
because
their
function
is
a
state
wide
function,
they
perform
the
same
function
with
respect
to
absentee
ballots
as
the
officers
in
the
other
counties
and
localities.
nor
is
this
case
moot
at
this
time.
it
is
true
that
the
two
named
representative
plaintiffs
are
not
in
the
cook
county
jail
awaiting
trial.
mr.
byrd
was
discharged
a
week
after
the
election
at
his
preliminary
hearing
and
mr.
mcdonald
went
to
trial,
it
was
a
hang
jury
and
he
subsequently
pleaded
to
a
reduce
charge
of
manslaughter
which
is
a
bailable
offense.
however,
since
this
is
a
class
action
and
was
found
to
be
so
by
the
trial
court
and
i
referred
to
page
30
of
the
record,
where
the
three-judge
court
says
plaintiffs
and
the
class
they
represent
are.
the
fact
that
this
is
a
class
action
means
that
the
fact
that
the
named
plaintiffs
are
not
members
of
the
class
a
more
is
not
fatal
as
this
court
indicated
a
month
after
the
jurisdictional
statement
was
filed
to
this
case
and
the
case
was
lee
versus
washington
which
involved
the
desegregation
of
the
alabama
jails.
this
court
--
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
no
effort
has
made
--
was
made
to
name
any
persons
but
i
presume
and
i
would
respectfully
ask
the
court
to
respect
the
judgement
of
the
district
court
that
this
was
a
class
action
and
that
there
are
in
the
county
jail
prior
to
each
election,
a
certain
number
of
persons
for
which
--
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
what
is
it
at
this
moment?
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
well,
mr.
justice
marshall,
the
problem
is
that
the
class
really
cannot
be
seen
very
clearly
until
right
before
an
election
because
it's
very
difficult
to
predict
exactly
who
will
be
a
pre-trial
detainee
on
the
day
of
election.
one
could
ascertain
with
some
degree
of
certainty
perhaps
that
we
go
to
before
the
election
exactly
which
persons,
which
named
persons
would
be
pre-trial
detainees
unable
to
get
to
the
polls
on
election
day
and
because
this
class
is
rather
fluid,
it's
really
impossible
to
identify
any
names
except
right
before
an
election
but
i
think
the
three-judge
court
below
recognized
that
there
surely
must
be
a
number
of
persons
who
are
registered
qualified
voters
in
jail
on
the
day
of
election.
incidentally,
the
cook
county
jail
has
about
1800
inmates,
2/3
of
which
awaiting
trial,
so
that
then
there
must
be
some
number
of
person
although
they
cannot
be
identified
except
right
near
an
election.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
vague
questions
because
--
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
that's
correct.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
and
we're
not
attacking
that
provision
on
making
application
within
a
certain
amount
of
time
as
being
--
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
yes.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
well,
it's
a
reasonable
provision.
i
don't
think
that
there
is
anything
unreasonable
about
requiring
submissions
perhaps
to
do
ballots
to
be
made
in
a
certain
time
because
there
are
some
administers.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
well,
i'm
not
assailing
the
provisions
regarding
time.
we
are
assailing
the
substantive
provisions
as
to
who
can
take
the
ballot.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
that's
correct.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
i
will
turn
to
that.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
no,
they're
unconvicted.
we
use
the
word
unsentenced
a
few
times
but
the
--
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
the
--
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
there
was
some
loose
language,
we
intended
and
was
clear
but
the
time
were
litigating
this,
we
were
dealing
with
the
pre-trial
detainees
rather
than
persons
who
were
between
that
period
of
conviction
and
sentence.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
well
frankly,
i
would
like
to
allude
to
an
argument
which
might
be
considered
a
due
process
one
i
haven't
raised
it
the
brief
but
we
raised
it
with
respect
to
answering
the
board
of
election
commissioners
argument
about
the
fact
that
persons
who
can
be
deprived
of
liberty
cannot
assert
privilege.
in
other
words,
if
it
is
a
due
process
argument,
it
would
be
that
the
mere
fact
the
person
is
detained
prior
to
trial
does
not
mean
that
he
could
be
deprived
the
all
rights.
i
would
like
to
turn
to
the
merits
of
the
case
at
this
time.
this
case
was
originally
argued
on
a
rational
basis
test
but
recently
this
court
decided
the
williams
versus
rhodes
which
seems
to
have
put
the
right
to
vote
on
a
first
amendment
basis
and
it
appears
to
us
that
williams
versus
rhodes
makes
clear
that
the
right
to
--
that
there
is
a
relation
between
voting
and
political
expression
which
is
protected
by
the
first
amendment
and
secondly,
that
the
state
must
show
a
compelling
state
interest
in
imposing
heavy
burdens
upon
the
right
to
vote.
now,
in
this
case,
it's
not
very
clear,
it's
not
clear
at
all
whether
there
are
any
legitimate
state
interests
who
are
compelling
to
justify
the
denial
of
the
right
to
vote
to
a
person
whose
awaiting
trial.
it
would
appear
that
the
most
that
the
election
board
could
say
would
be
that
there's
an
administrative
convenience
in
not
having
to
dispense
too
many
absentee
ballots,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
mere
fact
that
it's
a
few
more
absentee
ballots
to
give
out
does
not
justify
deprivation
of
such
a
fundamental
right.
the
board
of
election
commission
has
taken
the
position
in
its
brief
that
voting
is
a
privilege
or
the
voting
by
absentee
ballot
is
a
privilege
rather
than
array.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
by
calling
something
a
privilege
doesn't
mean
that
the
state
can
arbitrarily
deny
it
to
you.
surely,
if
absentee
ballots
were
dispensed
on
the
basis
of
race,
i
don't
think
this
court
would
hesitate
to
say
that
that
would
be
a
denial
of
equal
protection
of
the
law,
merely
because
absentee
balloting
may
be
considered
a
privilege
by
the
state,
and
the
district
court
in
brown
versus
post
which
we
referred
to
in
our
reply
brief
held
that
where
the
board
of
--
where
the
elections
people
went
to
the
nursing
home,
the
white
nursing
homes
and
not
the
black
nursing
homes
that
that
was
a
denial
of
equal
protection
of
the
law
and
in
giving
out
absentee
ballots.
we
submit
that
the
mere
fact
that
there
is
an
absentee
ballot
rather
than
voting
in
person
does
not
justify
such
a
distinction.
now,
the
board
of
election
commissioners
raises
the
question,
“need
prisoners
be
afforded
privileges
when
they
can
be
denied
liberty.”
i
think
this
is
perhaps
the
first
case
that
this
court
has
had
an
opportunity
to
determine,
whether
there
are
any
conditions
or
consequences
of
pretrial
detention
which
may
be
considered
constitutionally
impermissible.
we
must
recognize
that
no
matter
how
much
bail
reform
occurs
there
is
just
going
to
be
a
number
of
people
are
going
to
be
incarcerated
prior
to
trial
and
it
seems
to
me
that
we
must
address
ourselves
to
the
consequences
of
the
pretrial
detention.
i
don't
think
it's
a
basic
proposition
one
could
say
that
the
mere
fact
the
man
is
detained
prior
to
trial
means
you
can
do
anything
you
want
with
him.
i
think
he's
entitled
to
certain
minimum
standards
of
decency.
i
think
that
if
the
state
attempts
to
deny
certain
basic
rights,
they
must
show
a
compelling
interest.
now,
what
kind
of
compelling
interest
might
be
shown?
perhaps
institutions
have
certain
rules
regarding
persons
who
visit.
considerations
of
institutional
security
of
course
are
parallel.
i
think
this
court
in
lee
versus
washington
indicated
that
it's
decision
in
no
way
suggested
that
the
warden
couldn't
make
allowances
for
institutional
security.
but
nowhere
in
the
record
of
this
case
or
in
any
case
have
i
ever
heard
that
inmate
voting
by
absentee
ballots
or
some
--
have
--
going
to
disrupt
the
routine
of
an
institution.
there's
nothing
to
suggest
that
it
does.
i
think
common
sense
would
suggest
that
perhaps
morale
would
be
a
lift
when
somebody
votes
from
behind
bars.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
yes
i
did,
i
made
a
state
by
state
canvass.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
well,
i
found
out
that
--
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
every
state
grants
absentee
ballots
to
the
servicemen
who
are
abroad.
two
states
seem
to
recognize
the
right
of
prisoners
to
vote.
both
of
these
states
i
have
opinions
of
the
attorney
general
but
i
found
no
cases.
most
--
excuse
me.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
most
of
the
states
have
varying
provisions
from
physical
disability
to
absence
from
various
localities.
for
example,
once
--
the
12
states
say
that
if
you'll
be
absent
from
the
precinct,
you
can
get
an
absentee
ballot.
six
states
say
if
you're
absent
from
the
city,
you
get
an
absentee
ballot.
one
state,
louisiana
says
if
you're
absent
from
the
parish,
23
states
say
if
you're
absent
from
the
county,
and
five
states
say
if
you're
absent
from
the
state
on
election
day,
you
can
get
an
absentee
ballot.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
some
of
them
break
it
down
and
say
absence
in
the
county
for
business
reasons.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
that's
for
some
of
them
do.
that's
correct.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
some
do.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
that's
right.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
that's
correct.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
now,
we're
not
--
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
that's
correct.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
that's
right,
illinois
has
an
interesting
classification.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
i
think
maine
says
that.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
i
think
that's
the
only
state
that
does
it.
now,
we're
not
suggesting
that
everybody
who
wants
an
absentee
ballot
can
have
one.
there
are
certain
limitations
which
we
recognize
as
constitutionally.
for
example,
the
mere
fact
that
a
mother
who
has
children
or
a
breadwinner
who
has
a
job
with
long
hours
can't
get
to
the
polls,
may
find
it
inconvenient,
we
feel
that
we're
not
submitting
that
that's
a
denial
of
the
constitution
but
what
we
have
is
something
more
than
that.
we
have
the
state
putting
the
man
into
disability.
they
have
the
state
judge
putting
the
man
in
jail
on
election
day.
and
we
have
another
state
agency
which
refuses
the
ballot
and
together
that's
joint
state
action
which
effectively
deprives
a
man
of
the
rights
to
vote.
so
it
seems
to
me
that
the
situation
of
the
prisoners
can't
be
distinguished
and
any
decision
in
their
favor
would
not
necessarily
have
to
require
that
everybody
in
the
world
get
an
absentee
ballot.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
we
did
not
include
it
on
the
brief
your
honor,
justice
fortas.
i
would
be
glad
to
submit
that
by
way
of
a
supplemental
brief
if
i
think
i
believe
to
do
so.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
i
will.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
in
terms
of
legitimate
state
interest,
perhaps
it
might
be
urged
that
the
takeover
theory
that
all
of
the
inmates
voting
together
might
outweigh
a
community.
but
in
the
first
place,
the
inmates
would
vote
in
the
count
--
in
the
precinct
in
which
they
lived
prior
to
becoming
member
of
the
jail
population
so
that
they
would
not
vote
in
the
precinct
where
the
jail
was
located
but
they
would
be
in
disperse
from
the
various
precincts
in
which
they
come.
in
any
event,
i
think
that
the
takeover
theory
was
rejected
by
this
court
in
the
carrington
case.
now,
we
would
submit
that
the
--
that
this
case
can
be
decided
on
a
number
of
theories.
one
theory
would
be
that
the
granting
of
the
absentee
ballot
to
a
person
who
is
jailed
in
another
county
or
denial
of
an
absentee
ballot
of
a
person
jailed
in
the
county
of
his
residence
is
absolutely
irrational.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
that's
correct,
that's
my
second
theory.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
that's
my
second
theory
that
this
case
goes
off
on
the
fact
that
the
state
granted
him
unable
to
get
to
the
polls.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
well,
the
first
one
is
that
the
classifications
that
the
state
of
illinois
has
employed
are
not
rational
or
based
upon
compelling
state
interest.
that
is
that
the
board
of
election
commissioners
or
the
state
has
failed
to
show
in
what
respect
is
a
legitimate
state
interest
that
requires
the
denial
of
absentee
ballots
to
this
--
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
well,
i
would
say
yes
except
using
the
compelling
state
interest
theory
that
the
state
would
probably
be
able
to
show
in
a
large
number
of
those
situations
involving
their
inconvenience
rather
than
impossibility
that
there
is
a
legitimate
--
that
there
is
a
compelling
state
interest,
whereas
in
this
case,
i
don't
think
that
they
can
show
that.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
physically
incapacitated
i
believe
the
--
about
perhaps
half
of
the
states.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
well,
if
a
man
who
is
physically
incapacitated
and
he
can
produce
a
certificate
of
a
physician
which
the
illinois
statute
requires
and
if
he
is
inside
the
county,
he
can
get
an
absentee
ballot.
these
provision
--
and
also,
if
he
can
show
that
because
of
religious
groups,
he
can
get
--
there
was
also
a
way
--
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
there
was
one
classification
that
was
added
by
the
legislature
at
the
last
minute
which
escape
the
attorney's
and
the
three-judge
court
in
this
case
and
that
was
a
judge
of
election
who
is
working
on
election
day
--
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
--
on
a
precinct
other
than
his
own
but
those
are
the
classes.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
the
veterans?
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
well,
members
of
the
armed
forces.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
correct.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
and
many
other
people
who
are
out
of
the
state?
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
that's
right.
there
use
to
be
a
special
provision
for
servicemen
which
was
article
20
but
since
the
provision
was
added,
anybody
out
of
the
county,
that
automatically
swallowed
up
that
group.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
as
long
as
they're
out
of
the
county
that's
all
at
least
are
required.
the
board
of
election
commissioners
will
give
them
an
absentee
ballot.
and
even
if
a
man
is
in
jail
if
he's
in
the
county
other
than
the
county
of
his
residence,
presumably,
he'll
get
an
absentee
ballot
too.
so
it
seems
to
me
that
it's
difficult
to
say
that
this
refusal
to
give
absentee
ballots
to
these
class
of
persons
is
justified
by
considerations
of
institutional
security,
because
of
that
would
show,
the
legislature
would
have
said
i
hope
that
we
make
a
finding
that
because
of
the
routine
of
the
jail,
it
would
be
so
disruptive
that
no
absentee
ballot
should
go
to
prisons.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
and
those
who'll
be
out
of
the
county.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
that's
correct
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
it's
a
denial
by
implication
rather
than
expressed
denial
but
i
think
that
that
makes
this
case
stronger
because
had
the
legis
--
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
judge
lynch
said
that
he
could.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
judge
lynch
in
the
first
mcdonald
case
said.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
i
would
say
as
to
that
to
--
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
he
might
be
able
to
but
that
does
get
into
that
causation
question
as
to
whether
the
cause
has
in
ability
is
the
fact
that
he
is
sick
or
the
fact
that
he
is
incarcerated.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
i
think
if
he
had
his
physician
certificate
under
those
circumstances
that
the
board
of
election
commissioners
would
probably
give
him
the
ballot.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
i
think
so.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
no,
it
just
bars
those
that
are
well,
that
are
not
religious
that
are
unconsecrated
in
the
county
of
their
own
residence
and
it
seems
to
me
that
that
type
of
classification
doesn't
make
any
sense
and
is
certainly
is
not
justified
by
any
compelling
state
interest.
i
tried
to
figure
out,
if
there
were
any,
i
looked
at
the
brief
of
the
board
of
election
commissioner
as
unable
to
find
any.
it
seems
to
me
what
the
state
of
illinois
is
done
here
and
it
gives
this
court
a
unique
opportunity
to
get
into
the
area
of
absentee
ballots
is
--
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
well,
i
think
that
it's
an
important
one
because
absentee
ballots
have
been
with
us
since
the
civil
war
and
they've
become
a
very
convenient
means
of
voting.
it's
not
like
in
the
old
day
where
it
was
considered
such
a
new
process
that
this
court,
state
courts
was
tracking
them
down.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
well,
they
said
--
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
well,
they
said
in
this
case
that
you
don't
have
the
right
certificate.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
well,
as
i
understand
illinois
law,
it's
true
that
the
provisions
of
absentee
ballots
are
permissive
but
it
seems
to
me
that
--
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
he
said
he
would
be.
i
don't
know
if
there's
any
express
provision
that
says
if
you
give
an
absentee
ballots
to
other
persons
that'll
be
a
violation
of
the
law.
i
think
the
election
board
probably
assumes
that
if
he
gives
ballots
to
persons
other
than
those
named
expressly
that
this
would
be
a
violation
of
illinois
law.
but
as
i
read
the
statutes,
there
is
nothing
that
says,
don't
give
it
to
these
people,
it
just
doesn't
say,
give
it
to
these
people.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
it's
his
next
continued
court
date.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
it's
his
next
continued
court
date
if
that
continued
court
date.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
well
--
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
it's
--
that's
the
same
situation
as
a
person
who
thinks
he's
going
out
of
town
on
business.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
no
you're
not.
it's
only
--
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
he'd
be
similarly
situated.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
yes
it
would
and
it
would
apply
also
to
persons
who
are
convicted
of
civil
crimes,
non
support
or
contempt.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
it's
anything
other
than
conviction
of
a
felony
and
if
--
or
from
this
crime,
you're
not
disenfranchised
explicitly
but
you
do
run
into
the
problems
since
you
can't
get
to
the
polls.
are
you
entitled
to
that
mechanism
which
the
state
of
illinois
has
setup?
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
i
would
say
it
to
the
extent
to
which
the
state
can
show
a
compelling
interest
in
limiting
that
the
number
of
persons
that
can
come
in
campaign,
subject
to
the
certain
restrictions
which
are
atoned
to
the
institutional
framework
that
the
state
can
refuse
certain
rights
of
the
persons
who
want
to
campaign
but
it
seems
to
me
as
a
basic
preposition
is
to
whether
or
not
there
are
any
restraints
at
all.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
state
must
show
that
compelling
state
interest
in
the
case
where
they
seek
to
restrict
a
vote.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
well,
i
would
say
to
the
extent
to
which
he's
really
the
--
really
has
control
over
his
situation
that
that
would
mean,
not
like
the
fact
in
this
situation.
i
recognize
that
there
are
problems
of
judgment
in
determining
when
the
state
has
satisfied
its
burden
of
showing
a
compelling
state
interest.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
where
we
have
persons
like
persons
in
the
army
or
persons
in
jail.
that
person
is
precluded
by
an
official
act
from
getting
to
the
polls
and
he
would
have
to
break
the
law.
he
would
actually
have
to
escape
jail
or
go
awol
in
order
to
try
to
cast
his
vote.
and
we
submit
that
under
those
certain
circumstances,
the
state
must
show
a
very
compelling
interest
in
order
to
justify
giving
him
the
ballot
which
can
be
easily
be
voted
by
mail.
i
wanted
to
add
one
last
matter
and
that
is
that
we
have
a
presumption
of
innocence
under
the
law.
however,
in
reality,
this
presumption
can
be
willed
away
by
a
lot
of
circumstances.
for
example,
we're
beginning
to
discover
that
conditions
of
pretrial
detention
in
very
many
institutions
across
the
country
are
a
lot
lower
standard
than
we
would
consider
human
decency
it
requires.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
unless
this
court
is
willing
to
say
that
there
are
some
limitations,
there
are
some
rights
that
you
just
can't
take
away
from
the
man
merely
because
he's
awaiting
trial.
he's
presumed
to
be
innocent.
in
order
to
give
full
filthy
the
presumption
of
innocence,
the
court
has
got
to
say
that
it
was
a
very
important
right
the
state
must
show
a
compelling
state
interest
in
order
to
deprive
the
man
of
that
right.
i'd
like
to
receive
a
few
moments
of
time
to
--
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
i've
a
short
comment
your
honor.
first
is
to
the
question
about
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus,
i'm
responsible
for
that
phrase
writ
of
habeas
corpus
at
both
tandem,
i
thought
it
was
theoretically
possible
but
i
--
in
discussions
and
this
is
off
the
record
but
i
represent
to
the
court
in
discussions
with
the
chief
judge
of
the
criminal
division
that
whether
persons
could
be
taken
over
is
sort
of
laugh
the
idea
and
didn't
think
it
was
feasible
at
all
to
have
reach
supreme
people
over
--
have
deputy
sheriffs
to
accompany
them
to
the
polls.
with
reference
to
the
legitimate
state
interest
to
prevent
fraud,
i
would
say
that
if
there
where
state
provision
that
said
no
absentee
ballot
for
anybody
in
the
jail
that
would
be
one
thing.
but
presumably
these
ballots
can
be
given
the
persons
in
jail
in
another
county
and
the
likelihood
of
fraud
is
just
as
great
and
--
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
well,
we're
talking
about
the
person
who
lives
in
chicago
--
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
--
who's
caught
out
in
wheaton
--
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
that's
true
but
i
would
indicate
that
the
absentee
ballot
procedure
is
that
one
has
to
cast
the
ballot
in
the
presence
of
a
notary
rebook
outside
the
state
so
that
there
is
a
check
against
fraud
and
finally
i
would
--
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
well,
as
i
indicated
mr.
--
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
it
occurred
to
me
and
when
i
took
that
up
with
chief
judge
of
the
criminal
division
he
indicated
that
it
was
not
a
very
feasible
--
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
no,
we
do
not.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
we
took
the
position
--
realistic
position
that
the
only
way
a
person
in
jail
could
vote
is
by
mail
that
it
would
be
extremely
and
in
positions
on
the
state
to
require
armed
deputy
sheriffs
to
takes
somebody
to
the
polls
and
we
talk
about
--
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
well,
it
seems
on
me
that
--
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
well,
we
would
submit
that
in
terms
of
the
consequences
of
pretrial
detention
that
this
is
an
impermissible
one
and
this
is
--
absentee
balloting
is
the
only
way
we
can
meaningfully
talk
about
a
person
in
jail
voting.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
well,
i
suppose
deputy
sheriff
would
have
to
go
in
there
and
that
would
be
rather
inconsistent
--
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
that
would
certainly
violate
secrecy
which
would
not
be
violated
if
an
absentee
ballot
were
cast
in
jail
with
the
present
of
a
notary.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
well,
i
would
say
this
that
i
made
the
value
judgment
and
i'm
responsible
for
that
that
after
discussing
this
thing
with
the
chief
judge
of
the
criminal
division,
i
felt
that
his
position
was
reasonable
and
that
the
only
way
to
talk
meaningfully
about
voting
is
voting
by
mail
rather
than
in
person.
and
if
the
right
to
vote
by
absentee
ballot
cannot
obtain
--
be
obtained
from
this
court,
i
suppose
we'll
have
to
try
to
exhaust
the
other
possibility
legally
and
see
if
we
could
--
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
no,
that
is
filing
of
petitions
for
writ
habeas
corpus
at
both
tandem
to
see
if
we
can
show
that
the
state
is
foreclosing
all
avenues
of
voting
back
pre-trial
detainees.
mr.
stanley
a.
bass
well,
i
don't
know
that's
one
of
the
activities
about
legal
aid
project
is
to
try
to
get
people
interested
in
their
citizenship
rights
because
at
present
they
seems
to
be
more
interested
in
taking
there
grievances
to
the
street
than
to
the
ballot
box.
thank
you
your
honor.
