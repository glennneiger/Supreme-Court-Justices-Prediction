justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words
these
are
not
people
who
have
been
convicted
of
crime,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they're
just
awaiting
trial?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
need
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
am
i
right
mr.
kusper
of
the
fact
that
this
affidavit
says
is
that
it
has
to
be
denied
just
specific
or
affirmatively
written
on
the
election
law
of
illinois
that
absentee
ballot
shall
be
not
given
to
the
pre-trial
detained.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know
what
it
said
but
doesn't
this
affidavit
have
other
fact?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
did
mr.
boseman
mean
when
he
said
i
will
grant
future
application
only
when
compelled
to
do
so
by
composing
possibly
accordance
to
incumbent
jurisdiction
as
i'm
am
done
on
three
previous
occasions?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
ordered
you
to
do,
why?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
your
point
is
that
if
somebody
come
down
with
an
affidavit
saying
i'm
going
to
be
in
the
county
on
election
day
but
i'm
going
to
be
awfully
busy
because
i'm
going
to
taken
care
of
my
sister's
sick
child
and
can't
get
to
the
poll.
then
the
election
board
could
not
under
the
law
have
granted
that
person
an
absentee
ballot
and
if
they've
done
so
they
would
have
been
subjected
to
criminal
penalty
simply
because
there's
no
provision
for
that
kind
of
a
person
voting
absentees,
isn't
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
kusper
am
i
wrong,
i
thought
the
class
was
even
narrower
than
that,
it
was
of
those
pre-trial
detainees
detained
in
a
prison
in
the
county
where
they
were
register,
am
i
wrong?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
thought
that
was
we
were
told?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
it
doesn't
--
this
doesn't
reach
for
example
detainees
and
some
prison
outside
the
county
of
the
residence
state?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
did
you
ever
get
any
applications
from
such
prisoners
outside
the
county?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
the
voting
age
21
and
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
i
expect
to
the
extent
some
of
these
detainees
were
under
21?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
or
even
residence
of
the
county.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
suppose
you
had
to
(inaudible)
to
the
voting
place,
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
would
that
violate
another
provision
going
on?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
might
not
be
there
