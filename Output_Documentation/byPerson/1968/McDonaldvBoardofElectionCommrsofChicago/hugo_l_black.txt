justice
hugo
l.
black
go
ahead.
justice
hugo
l.
black
uppose
a
business
--
medically
incapacitated,
wouldn't
he
be
allowed
to
vote?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
mean,
wouldn't
that
be
a
reasonable
interpretation
of
the
statute?
it
doesn't
say
that
a
medically
incapacitated
man
who's
in
prison
will
not
to
be
granted
the
right
to
vote.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
would
think
that
your
prisoners
would
be
as
medically
incapacitated
like
the
class
a
created
would
come
under
that
statute
and
be
entitled
to
have
an
absentee
ballot.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that
might
some
--
there's
someone
that
might
be
then
medically
incapacitated.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yeah,
that's
what
i
thought.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
that
that
involves
his
business?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
necessary
for
one
who's
on
your
side?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
necessary
for
one
who
wants
to
be
on
your
side,
try
to
put
it
on
the
basis
on
the
difference
between
the
privilege
and
a
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
would
think
it
makes
up
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
take
care
of
one
evil
have
to
take
care
of
every
possible
evil
that
anyone
can
conceive
off?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
would
you
deny
of
equal
protection
if
you
didn't
fix
it
up
so
this
alimony
people
could
both
vote
and
cheat
their
wife
out
of
there
alimony.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
some
state
proceeds
in
such
an
improbable
eventuality
as
liable
to
occur.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
take
care
of
it
to
strike
down
the
whole
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
shouldn't
your
legislature
thought
of
those
two
person
out
of
8
millions.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
in
a
trouble
arrangement
with
the
problem
voting
absentee
ballot?
does
it
requires
considerable
study
to
prevent
evasion
of
that
law
so
as
to
bring
about
fraud
in
election
and
is
that
a
constants
source
of
fraud
in
election?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it's
a
state
interest
isn't
if
it's
going
to
do
that
to
try
to
get
the
law
where
the
least
complications
possible.
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
to
have
a
microscope
to
carry
around
to
see
the
infinite
decimal
point
that
which
one
or
two
person
out
of
8
million
might
not
be
allowed
to
vote?
justice
hugo
l.
black
maybe
they
don't
have
a
microscope
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
have
habeas
corpus
in
the
state,
do
you
know?
justice
hugo
l.
black
speaking
the
fact
medically
on
the
sense
of
a
common
sense
statement,
do
you
think
its
common
that
in
a
very
large
percentage
of
the
people
who
are
in
jail
without
bond
is
registered
voters?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
it's
likely
that
there
be
a
100%?
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
a
matter
of
curiosity,
what
was
suppose
to
having
to
do
with
the
case,
does
the
record
show
what
their
ordeal
for,
these
two?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
don't
know
what
the
other
one,
is
it
rubbery?
justice
hugo
l.
black
have
these
people
were
so
great
they
understood,
did
a
thought
occur
to
you
to
make
a
motion
before
the
judge
who
has
charge
of
the
custody
correctly
of
those
thing
and
who
could
have
grant
a
motion
on
your
part
to
let
them
vote?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
thought
occurred
to
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes
he
indicated
but
did
you
try,
did
you
file
the
proceeding?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
just
attack
the
constitutionality,
whole
of
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
would
it
be
if
its
added
part
of
term
maybe
that
--
well,
the
deputy
sheriff
would
have
been
glad
to
do
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
have
to
go
and
attack
the
constitutionality
of
the
law,
everybody
has
attacked
constitutionality
of
the
law.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
why
would
they
have
to
go
in
there
with
you
into
the
booth?
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
is
a
small
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
you
could
find
enough
prisoners
with
that
much
interest
in
voting?
justice
hugo
l.
black
go
ahead.
justice
hugo
