justice
abe
fortas
do
you
have
that
state
by
state
analysis
to
which
you
just
referred
in
your
brief?
justice
abe
fortas
it
would
be
helpful
if
you
do
that.
justice
abe
fortas
it's
alright.
justice
abe
fortas
doesn't
the
proposition
that
you're
advancing
here
lead
us
to
invalidate
an
awful
lot
of
these
state
laws
to
which
you've
referred.
that
is
to
say
why
is
it
--
you
make
the
distinction
that
here
the
prisoner
is
being
kept
away
from
the
polls
by
a
state
action,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
huh?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
suppose
when
you're
talking
about
what
is
--
what
is
primary
cause
(inaudible)
and
so
on,
what
is
your
first
reason?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that's
the
one
that
would
require
--
that
would
lead
at
least
by
the
treacherous
path
of
strict
logic
to
the
conclusion
that
we
have
to
examine
everyone
of
these
state
laws
and
say
that
it's
not
rational
or
reasonable
for
a
state
to
say
that
you
can
get
an
absentee
ballot
if
you're
out
of
town
on
business
but
not
if
you're
out
of
--
not
up
here
--
out
of
the
state
or
some
other
reason.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
how
can
a
person
who
is
in
jail
know
that
he
won't
be
out
in
time
to
vote
if
he
is
jail
and
hadn't
been
convicted?
justice
abe
fortas
sir?
justice
abe
fortas
maybe
a
bit
bail
or
maybe
you
represent
him
and
get
him
on
his
own
recognizance.
justice
abe
fortas
and
--
justice
abe
fortas
now,
how
about
a
fellow
who
will
know
not
quite
because
he's
not
being
held
and
released
by
somebody
else.
he's
theoretically
master
his
destiny.
how
about
a
person
who's
been
convicted
of
a
misdemeanor
and
is
in
jail,
now,
you're
not,
are
you
disqualified
under
illinois
law
if
you
have
been
convicted
of
misdemeanor?
justice
abe
fortas
and
suppose
the
court
has
been
convicted
of
a
misdemeanor
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
and
he's
in
jail,
the
same
principle
would
apply
to
him,
would
it?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
if
they're
going
to
vote,
i
suppose
they
don't
have
a
right
to
have
to
listen
to
political
arrange
appeals
to
their
better
nature
and
judgment.
justice
abe
fortas
your
submission
as
i
see
it
is
something
like
this
that
the
state
provide
--
the
state
accords
the
right
to
vote
to
everybody
with
certain
exclusions.
these
petitioner's
--
these
appellants
presumably
have
a
right
to
vote.
the
state
however
provides
a
special
procedure
in
certain
limited
classes
that
is
to
say
absentee
voting.
it
does
not
provide
a
special
procedure
with
respect
to
people
who
are
endurance
by
awaiting
trial
or
otherwise
and
your
point
is
the
state
has
no
duty
to
do
that.
indeed,
the
state
has
no
duty
to
extend
the
absentee
voting
alternative
method
across
the
board
as
to
anybody,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
that's
what
i'm
saying
that
the
state
has
no
obligation
to
provide
that
the
absentee
voting
alternative
procedure
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
to
anybody
although
the
state
might
have
to
extend
the
right
to
vote
to
--
for
example,
resident
servicemen,
franklin
against
ryche.
justice
abe
fortas
i
supposed
another
way
of
looking
at
it
might
be
to
put
the
question,
is
this
a
permissible
consequence
or
an
otherwise
appropriate
deprivation
of
liberty
by
the
state
that
is
in
so
state
put
somebody
in
jail
is
deprive
of
a
lot
of
rights.
he
is
deprived
by
the
right
to
work,
is
deprived
of
the
right
to
go
down
to
the
nearby
public
park
and
make
a
speech
because
he
is
there
endurance
by
all
and
i
supposed
whether
one
way
of
looking
at
this
is
whether
the
additional
consequence
namely
that
he
doesn't
have
access
to
naps
and
tea,
he
doesn't
have
the
physical
possibility
of
voting
regardless
of
his
theoretical
right,
whether
that
is
a
permissible
consequence
of
his
otherwise
lawful
arrest
by
the
state.
