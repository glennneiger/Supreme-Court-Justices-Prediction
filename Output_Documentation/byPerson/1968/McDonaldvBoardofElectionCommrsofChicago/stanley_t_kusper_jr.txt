mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
warren,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
beemsterboer,
mr.
bass.
counsel
for
petitioners,
excuse
me,
has
consistently
stated
this
case
in
the
negative,
both
at
the
trial
level
and
before
this
court.
his
constant
statement
has
been,
the
state
must
show
a
compelling
state
interest
in
depriving
this
small
group
of
persons
of
a
supposed
constitutional
right
to
an
absentee
ballot.
i
would
care
to
phrase
it
in
another
way
for
the
court.
the
state
has
extended
to
large
ascertainable
groups
of
people
the
privilege
of
absentee
balloting,
the
privilege
of
the
ballot,
excuse
me,
the
right
of
the
ballot
has
been
constitutionally
guaranteed
but
the
privilege
of
casting
it
under
conditions
imposed
by
the
state
which
are
reasonable
by
an
absentee
ballot,
i
think
its
just
that,
a
privilege
and
so
the
state
of
illinois
has
extended
to
large
discernable
ascertainable
groups
of
people
the
right
of
voting
by
absentee
ballot.
large
numbers
of
people
leave
the
community
on
business
or
for
whatever
other
reason
and
leave
the
county.
in
1968,
some
15000
applications
were
received
from
persons
at
the
board
of
election
commissioners.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
pardon?
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
i
don't
think
so
mr.
justice
--
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
i
don't
think
so
at
all
but
rather
than
confused
right
with
privilege,
let's
talk
about
what
it
really
is.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
no,
certainly
not.
i
think
a
state
legislature
in
attacking
any
kind
of
a
problem
or
any
kind
of
an
evil
may
take
it
that
the
entire
evil
at
one
time
may
take
it
step
by
step.
it
may
progress
from
one
phase
of
the
problem
to
another
phase
of
the
problem
and
make
corrections
as
it
has
seen
fit.
and
in
fact,
in
illinois
as
the
trial
court
below
has
pointed
out,
absentee
balloting
was
instituted
in
1917,
at
3208
and
it
was
modified
again
in
1944,
expanded
in
1955
and
just
in
the
1967
session
of
the
legislature,
short
time
subsequent
to
the
trial
of
this
case,
it
extended
absentee
balloting
to
those
persons
who
are
judges
of
election
who
would
serve
outside
the
precinct.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
why
were
they
excluded?
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
don't
know
why
they
were
excluded.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
i
think
the
state
has
a
reason
for
enacting
a
piece
of
legislation
in
--
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
--
the
nature
of
absentee
balloting.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
prisoners
awaiting
trial
outside
the
county
mr.
justice
marshall
are
outside
of
the
county
and
fall
into
that
class
of
persons
granted
the
absentee
ballot
privilege
--
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
because
they're
out
of
the
county.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
because
the
state
has
taken
affirmative
action
in
granting
the
absentee
ballots
to
groups
of
people.
it
has
by
inadvertence
or
otherwise,
i
don't
know
if
they
had
a
reason
for
it,
i
certainly
wouldn't
know
if
they
ever
considered
the
problem.
it
maybe
that
they
never
even
thought
of
the
problem.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
can
i
think
of
a
reason?
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
why
they
should
not
be
granted
an
absentee
ballot?
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
its
my
firm
belief
that
the
legislature
in
enacting
absentee
ballot
legislation
never
considered
the
problem
of
persons
present
inside
the
county
in
a
jail
awaiting
trial
and
persons
outside
of
a
county
awaiting
trial.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
i
don't
know
sir
whether
or
not
they
knew
about
it.
there
are
177
members
of
the
illinois
house,
there
are
59
members
of
the
illinois
senate,
i
would
not
presume
to
know
what
they
thought
about
it.
there
is
no
history
on
the
legislation
available
which
would
indicate
to
use
whether
or
not
they
even
considered
the
problem.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
i
don't
know
of
any
reason
at
all
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
could
not
--
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
no
i
believe
my
burden
sir
under
the
language
of
the
cases
of
this
court
is
first
of
all,
to
demonstrate
that,
mr.
bass
on
behalf
of
petitioners
has
not
carried
his
burden
to
show
that
there
is
unreasonable
basis
so
that
there
is
invidious
discrimination,
whether
there
is
arbitrariness
or
capriciousness
in
the
action
of
the
legislature
in
enacting
this
particular
legislation,
and
secondly,
if
the
burden
does
shift
to
me
to
rational
or
justify
the
decision
then
its
my
burden
to
go
forward
with
it
and
you
asked
me
for
a
reason
sir
and
i
cannot
give
you
a
reason
why
a
legislation
beginning
back
in
1917
prior
to
the
time
of
my
birth
sir,
why
that
legislation
did
not
contain
some
provision
for
these
persons.
it
is
my
sincere
belief
as
i
stated
before
that
the
legislature
just
not
ever
considered
the
problem.
either
a
because
it
wasn't
cognizant
of
it
or
b,
nobody
just
took
the
time
to
bring
it
up.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
no
sir,
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
that
would
indicate
that
and
there
is
nothing
in
the
history
of
the
legislation
that
would
indicate
it.
the
physical
incapacity
that
is
discussed
in
--
is
covered
in
the
statute
relates
itself
solely
to
the
question
of
physical
incapacity
because
of
physical
illness
that
properly
attested
to
by
the
affidavit
of
the
physician
or
of
a
christian
science
practitioner
and
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
nor
anything
in
the
legislative
history
which
would
indicate
that
the
legislature
ever
considered
this
and
deliberately
drew
distinction
between
the
two
classes
of
persons.
all
the
considered
was
in
the
county
and
who's
out.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
mr.
bass
is
apparently
drawn
the
distinction
your
honor.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
the
election
commissioners
and
i
was
present
at
all
times
when
this
petitions
for
absentee
ballot
were
presented.
the
election
commissioners
being
statutory
creature
is
bound
by
statutory
requirements
in
state
of
illinois.
they
have
the
ability
to
grant
absentee
ballots
in
those
specified
cases
enumerated
in
the
statute
allowing
the
privilege
of
absentee
voting.
when
mr.
bass
came
to
our
office
with
an
affidavit
and
an
application
for
a
ballot
with
the
affidavit
of
an
assistant
warden
i
believe
it
was
in
each
case.
he
did
not
comply
with
any
of
the
permissive
applications
that
were
provided
in
the
statute
and
therefore,
the
board
of
election
commissioners
--
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
they
said
sir
that
it
was
physically
impossible
for
them
to
be
in
attendance
at
the
polls
and
then
they
attached
an
affidavit
of
an
assistant
warden
which
says
they
couldn't
leave
the
premises
but
they
did
not
attach
the
affidavit
of
a
doctor
or
a
christian
science
practitioner
which
was
what
was
required
under
the
statute
of
illinois,
and
therefore
the
board
of
election
commissioners
being
purely
ministerial
at
this
point
could
not
accept
that
application
or
that
affidavit
and
could
not
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute
grant
an
absentee
ballot
to
do
so,
would
have
been
a
violation
of
illinois
law
under
the
article
29
(a).
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
i
don't
think
--
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
the
commissioners
acted
in
pursuant
to
illinois
statute.
there
is
no
question
about
the
fact
that
they
acted
under
illinois
law
in
their
capacity
as
officers
created
by
a
statute
in
illinois.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
yes
i
was
sir.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
was
i
advising
whom,
excuse
me.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
i
was
advising
the
election
commissioners
--
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
did
i
help
draw
the
affidavit
for
the
physically
incapacitated
people,
no
i
did
not
sir,
that
is
--
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
no,
i
did
not,
that
is
--
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
that
is
the
end
of
the
--
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
that
is
correct.
i
drew
the
affidavit
for
the
board
of
election
commissioners
that
is
correct.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
in
the
pleadings.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
there
is
a
general
provision
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
well,
there
is
a
state
statute
that
precludes
it
but
they
acted
in
denial
of
the
petition
for
an
absentee
ballot
pursuant
to
an
otherwise
state
statute.
they
just
couldn't
grant
it
because
the
state
statute
didn't
let
them
grant
it
and
it
would
subject
to
them
to
penalties
if
they
had.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
it's
not
exactly
what
it
says,
mr.
justice
brennan
--
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
what
it
says
is
i
can't
do
anything
other
than
which
is
permitted
to
me
to
do
under
the
laws
of
illinois
and
there
is
no
provision
in
the
absentee
balloting
act
of
illinois
which
allows
the
commissioner
to
grant
application
for
an
absentee
ballot
on
a
basis
of
these
warden's
affidavit.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
because
we
were
ordered
on
three
previous
occasions
by
the
federal
court,
judge
lynch
in
both
cases
presiding
and
it
was
not
a
state
court
it
was
a
federal
court
which
ordered
us
to
do
it
and
in
pursuance
to
that
kind
of
an
order
i
think
we
have
to
act,
it
put
us
between
the
devil
and
the
deep
blue
sea.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
you
ordered
us
to
give
an
absentee
ballot
to
a
particular
prisoner
on
three
different
occasions,
norman
bonds
and
also
mcdonald
on
two
occasions.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
absolutely
correct,
sir.
absolutely,
correct.
they
can't
give
--
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
well,
there
can
be
a
situation
in
which
there
is
no
absentee
voting.
it
isn't
constitutionally
provided
for
i
agree.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
i
agree.
that
is
correct.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
well,
he
was
duly
registered
and
still
prior
to
his
incarceration
a
resident
at
the
address
from
which
he
registered.
he
was
qualified
to
vote,
yes.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
correct.
had
he
appeared
at
his
precinct
polling
place
designated
for
his
residency.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
but
they
put
him
in
jail
via
due
process
route.
he
was
incarcerated
by
judicial
action.
if
he
comes
up
with
the
bail
money,
he
can
get
out.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
i
don't
think
so
under
the
pasture
of
the
law
as
we
have
it,
sir.
i
think
that
the
privilege
having
--
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
i
would
say
not
at
this
time.
no,
sir,
i
do
not
believe
so.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
absent
in
--
an
absentee
voting
statute
absent
that
the
state
has
a
right
not
to
have
him
walking
around
free
without
putting
put
the
necessary
bail.
item
which
they
require
of
everyone
who
is
incarcerated
and
he
was
subject
to
bail
so
that
they
have
a
right
for
the
security
of
the
public
and
the
public
welfare
to
keep
him
in
prison
until
such
time
as
he
makes
--
in
such
time
as
he
makes
the
necessary
bail
and
satisfies
due
process
in
the
courts
and
under
state
law
that
he
is
untitled
to
walk
about
as
a
free
man
until
his
trial
day.
so
that
i
think
that
we're
weighing
two
interests
now.
one
his
right
to
vote
and
two,
the
interest
in
the
right
of
the
other
people
in
the
community
and
also
the
right
to
justice
to
have
that
man
incarcerated
until
such
time
as
he
satisfies
the
due
process
requirements
and
the
requirements
of
the
court
to
get
back
out
on
the
street
again.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
mr.
justice
fortas
i
wished
i
had
said
yes,
and
i
hurriedly
concur.
i
believe
that
it
is
a
permissible
consequence
here
and
i
don't
think
that
without
complaining
about
the
unavailability
of
bail
or
anything
else
or
any
other
privileges,
the
only
one
single
privilege
about
which
we
have
a
complaint
here
is
the
unavailability
of
an
absentee
ballot
which
in
hierarchy
i
think
of
the
constitutionally
protected
rights
may
or
may
not
depending
upon
who
views
it
be
the
most
important
right
or
privilege
that
a
person
may
have
and
so
i
think
it
depends
upon
the
viewpoint
of
the
person
looking
at
the
situation.
you
may
say
sir
that
it
is
not
a
permissive
consequence.
i
might
say
that
it
is.
the
other
justices
may
disagree.
i
think
it's
a
justifiable
conclusion
that
it
is
permissible
in
this
situation
we
have.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
by
absentee
ballot?
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
well,
yes.
i
think
that
the
point
is
it
can
be
quite
seriously
made
that
if
a
person
has
got
money
he
can
get
out
of
jail
and
therefore
go
vote.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
apparently
that
is
true
under
the
statute
that
we
have.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
i
think
it's
a
valid
distinction
when
the
interests
of
the
society
are
considered
as
a
whole
rather
than
just
looking
at
it
in
isolation,
sir.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
i
wished
that
i
could
simplify
to
that
point
but
i
think
it's
a
little
more
complex
than
that.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
i
think
that
first
of
all
what
interest
did
the
state
have
in
extending
the
absentee
ballot
privilege.
if
we're
going
to
have
to
--
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
well,
not
necessarily
that.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
i
think
there
is
another
way.
a
man
without
money
quite
possibly
under
a
special
habeas
corpus
can
be
taken
from
the
jail
if
necessary
to
his
polling
place
and
therefore
be
allowed
to
vote
in
the
polling
place.
he
doesn't
need
bail
money,
doesn't
need
an
absentee
ballot
either.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
i
have
no
idea.
they
can
let
a
proper
petition
be
filed
and
quite
possibly
the
court
might
take
jurisdiction
over
something
like
the
cognizance
of
the
problem
and
order
a
remedy.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
in
this
case?
absolutely
nothing,
sir.
the
only
distinction
apparently
about
the
person
being
able
to
get
out
of
the
jail
to
go
vote
if
that
becomes
a
paramount
interest
is
the
fact
that
he's
got
some
money
to
get
out
but
i
would
like
to
raise
the
question
also
what
about
the
chap
who's
got
money
and
who
doesn't
want
to
put
up
to
bail
and
he
wants
to
stay
in
jail.
now,
should
he
be
allowed
to
have
absentee
ballots?
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
mr.
justice
white,
unfortunately
i
think
that
alimony
role
is
their
call
over
a
county
jail
and
cook
county
has
loaded
with
people
who
got
some
money,
who
just
don't
want
to
pay
it
up
so
therefore
they
can't
get
out
of
jail
and
there
i
think
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there're
great
number
of
people.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
aptly
put.
i
don't
know
whether
that
would
be
a
denial
of
equal
protection.
i
certainly
don't
think
that
given
the
option
to
put
up
bail
to
go
vote,
they're
making
the
choice
themselves
as
to
whether
or
not
they
should
have
the
franchise
in
person
at
polling
place
and
having
been
giving
that
option
and
having
exercise
it
in
the
negative
that
would
be
a
denial.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
no.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
no,
and
i
very
firmly
say
no
because
i
think
that's
what
gets
to
the
point
of
this
entire
case.
will
a
statute
which
does
substantial
good
and
substantial
justice
which
does
a
statute
would
reaches
great
numbers
of
people
to
facilitate
their
casting
their
ballot,
to
exercise
of
their
franchise.
that's
the
statute
because
it
reduces
itself
to
two
persons
out
of
a
possible
2000
or
1800.
out
of
a
possible
eight
million
registered
in
the
state
of
illinois.
does
the
statute
have
to
stricken
down
as
unconstitutional
as
violative
of
equal
protection
of
the
laws
because
two
people
can't
get
out
to
vote
and
two
people
can't
make
an
application
for
absentee
ballot
under
the
law
of
illinois?
i
don't
think
so
because
if
it
is
that
to
me
the
role
--
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
having
viewed
some
of
the
legislations
coming
out
of
his
spring
field,
i
would
think
that
the
legislative
should
have
thought
about
a
lot
of
things
sir.
we
usually
have
a
phrase
in
illinois,
the
legislature
in
its
wisdom.
they
have
my
thought
of
a
lot
of
things.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
absentee
balloting?
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
i
would
think
that
absentee
balloting
in
a
penal
institution
might
as
well
be
subject
to
a
great
instance
of
fraud.
our
institutions
are
there,
are
controlled
by
political
party
candidates
or
elected
to
public
office,
share
of
cook
county.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
i
would
agree
with
the
too
and
i
think
that's
part
and
partial
of
my
argument
that
a
statute
can
never
comprehend
its
applicability
to
all
conceivable
and
imagined
cases.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
i
don't
think
a
legislature
can
be
require
to
do
that
because
if
it
is
required
to
do
so
i
don't
think
--
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
maybe
they
don't
have
a
microscope,
maybe
they
don't
have
the
wisdom
to
see
it,
maybe
they
don't
have
the
time
under
the
pressure
of
work
to
see
but
i
don't
think
a
legislature
can
be
required
to
see
even
the
most
miniscule
problems.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
that
at
all,
all
we
have
was
the
fact
that
he
was
a
duly
qualified
registered
voter
before
he
went
in
to
prison.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
what
could
he
have
done?
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
well,
statute
doesn't
say
he
could
have
done
anything
because
there
is
no
provision
for
absentee
ballot.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
yes
we
do,
he
may
have
tried
that
and
i
mention
that
i
think
i
alluded
to
it
in
the
previous
statement
and
possibly
he
could
have
gotten
someone
to
go
on
habeas
corpus
for.
mr.
bass
was
representing
him,
has
grant
this
counsel
under
grant
i
believe
there
is
a
legal
aid
service.
he
was
representing
them
on
many
matters.
he
could
have
possibly
gone
before
the
court
on
habeas
corpus
that
was
not
tried
and
all
we
had
was
this
application
that
came
in
on
the
last
possible
day
for
application
prior
to
the
election
itself.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
in
three
instances
i
believe
that
what
happened.
in
going
back
to
a
subject
that
was
raised
and
discussed
by
mr.
justice
fortas
that
relative
to
the
varying
provisions
for
absentee
ballot
in
the
various
states
of
this
union
in
speaking
with
the
solicitor
general
and
the
break
just
after
he
argued
his
case.
his
wife
received
an
absentee
ballot
in
the
state
of
massachusetts
as
a
physically
disabled
person
only
because
she
was
in
a
community
twice
removed
from
the
community
in
which
she
lived.
in
other
word,
if
she
was
in
the
town
adjacent
to
the
city
or
town
in
which
she
lived
and
was
physically
disable,
under
massachusetts
law
she
could
not
have
receive
and
absentee
ballot,
she
had
to
get
one
town
in
between
and
move
to
a
third
town
outside
to
be
able
to
get
an
absentee
ballot.
now,
if
absentee
balloting
is
going
to
be
looked
at
with
a
very
caustic
eye
to
see
whether
or
not
it
denies
equal
protection
of
the
laws
then
maybe
that
kind
of
statute
too
should
be
scrutinized
and
i
would
venture
to
say
that
in
almost
every
instance
having
studied
election
laws
at
the
various
states
being
a
member
of
illinois
election
laws
commission
staff
counsel
working
on
recatication.
i
can
see
that
if
this
case
where
to
decide,
this
court
were
to
decide
that
illinois
statute
was
unconstitutional
that
the
great
bulk
of
the
statutes
concerning
absentee
balloting
would
then
immediately
be
suspect
and
subject
to
challenge
on
the
same
ground
because
there
are
some
provisions
which
i
think
or
even
more
unfair
on
other
states
than
they
are
at
illinois.
if
this
be
unfair
at
all
assuming
argue
and
that
it
could
unfair
but
i
think
what
we
have
here
is
unintentional
omission
of
the
legislature,
no
intention,
no
malice,
no
purpose
fullness
at
all,
no
discrimination,
they're
just
a
classification
made
by
the
legislature
and
a
valid
attempt
to
extend
the
privilege
of
absentee
balloting
to
large
ascertainable
groups
of
persons
that
has
just
simply
missed
in
its
application,
one
small
and
i
might
even
add
miniscule
group
of
persons,
two
persons
is
all
we've
had
notwithstanding
the
fact
--
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
it
is
a
class
action.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
oh
i
say
two
people
because
i
think
i've
been
very
close
to
this
case
and
i
know
how
these
cases
came
about.
and
after
the
norman
bans
case,
if
moral
on
the
county
jail
of
cook
county
was
so
much
uplifted
because
of
this
decision
then
we
quite
possibly
could
have
assume
there
would
have
been
an
outpouring
of
applications
for
absentee
ballot
again,
but
then
we
only
got
mcdonald
in
mcdonald
one
to
make
an
application
and
then
only
mcdonald
and
another
person
again.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
the
case?
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
who
are
registered
voters
--
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
--
and
qualified
to
vote
at
the
time
of
an
election.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
--
and
there
may
not
be
any
such
person
at
all.
there
is
no
way
to
determine
the
existence
of
that
on
the
state
wide
basis.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
well,
i
might
assume
that
to
sir
but
there
is
no
--
what
i'm
saying
mr.
justice
marshall
is
there's
no
demonstrable
way
that
i
can
show
to
the
court
that
that
class
exist
that
this
moment
or
any
other
moment
because
you
couldn't
do
a
survey
to
determine
it.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
at
the
time
that
it
was
filed
yes,
no
question.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
as
it
was
brought
then
yes.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
i
would
assume
that,
yes
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
yes,
definite
sir.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
no,
because
they
fall
under
the
general
class
of
persons
who
are
outside
the
county
and
therefore
they
are
entitled
to
absentee
ballot
under
the
provision
of
our
statute.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
no
sir,
not
to
my
knowledge,
anyway
that
been
with
the
four
or
seven
years
ago.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
no
sir,
i
have
heard
of
none
in
the
state
and
i
think
that
i'm
probably
would
have
because
i'm
in
constant
communication
with
the
other
election
officials
of
the
state.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
none
to
my
knowledge
whatsoever.
the
only
time
this
question
is
even
started
to
come
up
was
in
norman
bans
and
then
mcdonald
one
and
on
mcdonald
two
in
which
mr.
bass
participated
on
all
three
cases,
so
that
--
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
i
would
have
no
way
of
knowing
that,
i
wish
i
could
--
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
if
the
justice
is
asking
me
for
a
quest
i
don't
think
that
the
percentage
is
going
to
be
very
high
because
we
might
have
seen
more
of
it
in
this
case
than
just
the
two
plaintiffs
that
we
have
here.
and
then
conclusion
that
its
time
misleading.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
pardon
me
sir.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
he
was
otherwise
qualified
to
vote,
yes
sir
he
was
a
duly
registered
person
qualified
to
vote
had
he
appeared
in
his
polling
place
on
election
day.
yes,
both
of
them
byrd
and
mcdonald
both.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
yes.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
well,
i
think
the
class
gets
down
to
a
point
where
it
becomes
a
very,
very
small
class
because
not
all
persons
who
are
in
the
county
jail
are
going
to
be
21,
not
all
of
are
going
to
registered
voters.
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
or
even
residence
of
the
county
because
you
going
to
detained
in
our
county
jail
for
commission
of
a
crime
there
and
the
accusation
of
it
without
being
a
residence
the
county.
so
i
think
we
have
--
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
one
was
in
on
a
charge
of
murder
and
i
forget
what
the
other
one
was
that
mr.
bass
would
know
that
i
think
the
record
discloses
it
and
i
think
its
someone
on
the
bridge,
i
think
its
on
our
brief
--
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
rubbery,
right.
one
was
release
on
preliminary
hearing
and
one
that
was
tried,
got
a
hang
jury,
eventually
was
retried
and
pleaded
guilty
to
manslaughter.
we
think
--
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
warren,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
beemsterboer,
mr.
bass.
counsel
for
petitioners,
excuse
me,
has
consistently
stated
this
case
in
the
negative,
both
at
the
trial
level
and
before
this
court.
his
constant
statement
has
been,
the
state
must
show
a
compelling
state
interest
in
depriving
this
small
group
of
persons
of
a
supposed
constitutional
right
to
an
absentee
ballot.
i
would
care
to
phrase
it
in
another
way
for
the
court.
the
state
has
extended
to
large
ascertainable
groups
of
people
the
privilege
of
absentee
balloting,
the
privilege
of
the
ballot,
excuse
me,
the
right
of
the
ballot
has
been
constitutionally
guaranteed
but
the
privilege
of
casting
it
under
conditions
imposed
by
the
state
which
are
reasonable
by
an
absentee
ballot,
i
think
its
just
that,
a
privilege
and
so
the
state
of
illinois
has
extended
to
large
discernable
ascertainable
groups
of
people
the
right
of
voting
by
absentee
ballot.
large
numbers
of
people
leave
the
community
on
business
or
for
whatever
other
reason
and
leave
the
county.
in
1968,
some
15000
applications
were
received
from
persons
at
the
board
of
election
commissioners.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
pardon?
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
i
don't
think
so
mr.
justice
--
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
i
don't
think
so
at
all
but
rather
than
confused
right
with
privilege,
let's
talk
about
what
it
really
is.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
no,
certainly
not.
i
think
a
state
legislature
in
attacking
any
kind
of
a
problem
or
any
kind
of
an
evil
may
take
it
that
the
entire
evil
at
one
time
may
take
it
step
by
step.
it
may
progress
from
one
phase
of
the
problem
to
another
phase
of
the
problem
and
make
corrections
as
it
has
seen
fit.
and
in
fact,
in
illinois
as
the
trial
court
below
has
pointed
out,
absentee
balloting
was
instituted
in
1917,
at
3208
and
it
was
modified
again
in
1944,
expanded
in
1955
and
just
in
the
1967
session
of
the
legislature,
short
time
subsequent
to
the
trial
of
this
case,
it
extended
absentee
balloting
to
those
persons
who
are
judges
of
election
who
would
serve
outside
the
precinct.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
why
were
they
excluded?
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
don't
know
why
they
were
excluded.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
i
think
the
state
has
a
reason
for
enacting
a
piece
of
legislation
in
--
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
--
the
nature
of
absentee
balloting.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
prisoners
awaiting
trial
outside
the
county
mr.
justice
marshall
are
outside
of
the
county
and
fall
into
that
class
of
persons
granted
the
absentee
ballot
privilege
--
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
because
they're
out
of
the
county.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
because
the
state
has
taken
affirmative
action
in
granting
the
absentee
ballots
to
groups
of
people.
it
has
by
inadvertence
or
otherwise,
i
don't
know
if
they
had
a
reason
for
it,
i
certainly
wouldn't
know
if
they
ever
considered
the
problem.
it
maybe
that
they
never
even
thought
of
the
problem.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
can
i
think
of
a
reason?
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
why
they
should
not
be
granted
an
absentee
ballot?
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
its
my
firm
belief
that
the
legislature
in
enacting
absentee
ballot
legislation
never
considered
the
problem
of
persons
present
inside
the
county
in
a
jail
awaiting
trial
and
persons
outside
of
a
county
awaiting
trial.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
i
don't
know
sir
whether
or
not
they
knew
about
it.
there
are
177
members
of
the
illinois
house,
there
are
59
members
of
the
illinois
senate,
i
would
not
presume
to
know
what
they
thought
about
it.
there
is
no
history
on
the
legislation
available
which
would
indicate
to
use
whether
or
not
they
even
considered
the
problem.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
i
don't
know
of
any
reason
at
all
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
could
not
--
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
no
i
believe
my
burden
sir
under
the
language
of
the
cases
of
this
court
is
first
of
all,
to
demonstrate
that,
mr.
bass
on
behalf
of
petitioners
has
not
carried
his
burden
to
show
that
there
is
unreasonable
basis
so
that
there
is
invidious
discrimination,
whether
there
is
arbitrariness
or
capriciousness
in
the
action
of
the
legislature
in
enacting
this
particular
legislation,
and
secondly,
if
the
burden
does
shift
to
me
to
rational
or
justify
the
decision
then
its
my
burden
to
go
forward
with
it
and
you
asked
me
for
a
reason
sir
and
i
cannot
give
you
a
reason
why
a
legislation
beginning
back
in
1917
prior
to
the
time
of
my
birth
sir,
why
that
legislation
did
not
contain
some
provision
for
these
persons.
it
is
my
sincere
belief
as
i
stated
before
that
the
legislature
just
not
ever
considered
the
problem.
either
a
because
it
wasn't
cognizant
of
it
or
b,
nobody
just
took
the
time
to
bring
it
up.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
no
sir,
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
that
would
indicate
that
and
there
is
nothing
in
the
history
of
the
legislation
that
would
indicate
it.
the
physical
incapacity
that
is
discussed
in
--
is
covered
in
the
statute
relates
itself
solely
to
the
question
of
physical
incapacity
because
of
physical
illness
that
properly
attested
to
by
the
affidavit
of
the
physician
or
of
a
christian
science
practitioner
and
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
nor
anything
in
the
legislative
history
which
would
indicate
that
the
legislature
ever
considered
this
and
deliberately
drew
distinction
between
the
two
classes
of
persons.
all
the
considered
was
in
the
county
and
who's
out.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
mr.
bass
is
apparently
drawn
the
distinction
your
honor.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
the
election
commissioners
and
i
was
present
at
all
times
when
this
petitions
for
absentee
ballot
were
presented.
the
election
commissioners
being
statutory
creature
is
bound
by
statutory
requirements
in
state
of
illinois.
they
have
the
ability
to
grant
absentee
ballots
in
those
specified
cases
enumerated
in
the
statute
allowing
the
privilege
of
absentee
voting.
when
mr.
bass
came
to
our
office
with
an
affidavit
and
an
application
for
a
ballot
with
the
affidavit
of
an
assistant
warden
i
believe
it
was
in
each
case.
he
did
not
comply
with
any
of
the
permissive
applications
that
were
provided
in
the
statute
and
therefore,
the
board
of
election
commissioners
--
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
they
said
sir
that
it
was
physically
impossible
for
them
to
be
in
attendance
at
the
polls
and
then
they
attached
an
affidavit
of
an
assistant
warden
which
says
they
couldn't
leave
the
premises
but
they
did
not
attach
the
affidavit
of
a
doctor
or
a
christian
science
practitioner
which
was
what
was
required
under
the
statute
of
illinois,
and
therefore
the
board
of
election
commissioners
being
purely
ministerial
at
this
point
could
not
accept
that
application
or
that
affidavit
and
could
not
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute
grant
an
absentee
ballot
to
do
so,
would
have
been
a
violation
of
illinois
law
under
the
article
29
(a).
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
i
don't
think
--
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
the
commissioners
acted
in
pursuant
to
illinois
statute.
there
is
no
question
about
the
fact
that
they
acted
under
illinois
law
in
their
capacity
as
officers
created
by
a
statute
in
illinois.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
yes
i
was
sir.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
was
i
advising
whom,
excuse
me.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
i
was
advising
the
election
commissioners
--
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
did
i
help
draw
the
affidavit
for
the
physically
incapacitated
people,
no
i
did
not
sir,
that
is
--
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
no,
i
did
not,
that
is
--
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
that
is
the
end
of
the
--
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
that
is
correct.
i
drew
the
affidavit
for
the
board
of
election
commissioners
that
is
correct.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
in
the
pleadings.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
there
is
a
general
provision
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
well,
there
is
a
state
statute
that
precludes
it
but
they
acted
in
denial
of
the
petition
for
an
absentee
ballot
pursuant
to
an
otherwise
state
statute.
they
just
couldn't
grant
it
because
the
state
statute
didn't
let
them
grant
it
and
it
would
subject
to
them
to
penalties
if
they
had.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
it's
not
exactly
what
it
says,
mr.
justice
brennan
--
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
what
it
says
is
i
can't
do
anything
other
than
which
is
permitted
to
me
to
do
under
the
laws
of
illinois
and
there
is
no
provision
in
the
absentee
balloting
act
of
illinois
which
allows
the
commissioner
to
grant
application
for
an
absentee
ballot
on
a
basis
of
these
warden's
affidavit.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
because
we
were
ordered
on
three
previous
occasions
by
the
federal
court,
judge
lynch
in
both
cases
presiding
and
it
was
not
a
state
court
it
was
a
federal
court
which
ordered
us
to
do
it
and
in
pursuance
to
that
kind
of
an
order
i
think
we
have
to
act,
it
put
us
between
the
devil
and
the
deep
blue
sea.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
you
ordered
us
to
give
an
absentee
ballot
to
a
particular
prisoner
on
three
different
occasions,
norman
bonds
and
also
mcdonald
on
two
occasions.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
absolutely
correct,
sir.
absolutely,
correct.
they
can't
give
--
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
well,
there
can
be
a
situation
in
which
there
is
no
absentee
voting.
it
isn't
constitutionally
provided
for
i
agree.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
i
agree.
that
is
correct.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
well,
he
was
duly
registered
and
still
prior
to
his
incarceration
a
resident
at
the
address
from
which
he
registered.
he
was
qualified
to
vote,
yes.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
correct.
had
he
appeared
at
his
precinct
polling
place
designated
for
his
residency.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
but
they
put
him
in
jail
via
due
process
route.
he
was
incarcerated
by
judicial
action.
if
he
comes
up
with
the
bail
money,
he
can
get
out.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
i
don't
think
so
under
the
pasture
of
the
law
as
we
have
it,
sir.
i
think
that
the
privilege
having
--
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
i
would
say
not
at
this
time.
no,
sir,
i
do
not
believe
so.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
absent
in
--
an
absentee
voting
statute
absent
that
the
state
has
a
right
not
to
have
him
walking
around
free
without
putting
put
the
necessary
bail.
item
which
they
require
of
everyone
who
is
incarcerated
and
he
was
subject
to
bail
so
that
they
have
a
right
for
the
security
of
the
public
and
the
public
welfare
to
keep
him
in
prison
until
such
time
as
he
makes
--
in
such
time
as
he
makes
the
necessary
bail
and
satisfies
due
process
in
the
courts
and
under
state
law
that
he
is
untitled
to
walk
about
as
a
free
man
until
his
trial
day.
so
that
i
think
that
we're
weighing
two
interests
now.
one
his
right
to
vote
and
two,
the
interest
in
the
right
of
the
other
people
in
the
community
and
also
the
right
to
justice
to
have
that
man
incarcerated
until
such
time
as
he
satisfies
the
due
process
requirements
and
the
requirements
of
the
court
to
get
back
out
on
the
street
again.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
mr.
justice
fortas
i
wished
i
had
said
yes,
and
i
hurriedly
concur.
i
believe
that
it
is
a
permissible
consequence
here
and
i
don't
think
that
without
complaining
about
the
unavailability
of
bail
or
anything
else
or
any
other
privileges,
the
only
one
single
privilege
about
which
we
have
a
complaint
here
is
the
unavailability
of
an
absentee
ballot
which
in
hierarchy
i
think
of
the
constitutionally
protected
rights
may
or
may
not
depending
upon
who
views
it
be
the
most
important
right
or
privilege
that
a
person
may
have
and
so
i
think
it
depends
upon
the
viewpoint
of
the
person
looking
at
the
situation.
you
may
say
sir
that
it
is
not
a
permissive
consequence.
i
might
say
that
it
is.
the
other
justices
may
disagree.
i
think
it's
a
justifiable
conclusion
that
it
is
permissible
in
this
situation
we
have.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
by
absentee
ballot?
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
well,
yes.
i
think
that
the
point
is
it
can
be
quite
seriously
made
that
if
a
person
has
got
money
he
can
get
out
of
jail
and
therefore
go
vote.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
apparently
that
is
true
under
the
statute
that
we
have.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
i
think
it's
a
valid
distinction
when
the
interests
of
the
society
are
considered
as
a
whole
rather
than
just
looking
at
it
in
isolation,
sir.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
i
wished
that
i
could
simplify
to
that
point
but
i
think
it's
a
little
more
complex
than
that.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
i
think
that
first
of
all
what
interest
did
the
state
have
in
extending
the
absentee
ballot
privilege.
if
we're
going
to
have
to
--
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
well,
not
necessarily
that.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
i
think
there
is
another
way.
a
man
without
money
quite
possibly
under
a
special
habeas
corpus
can
be
taken
from
the
jail
if
necessary
to
his
polling
place
and
therefore
be
allowed
to
vote
in
the
polling
place.
he
doesn't
need
bail
money,
doesn't
need
an
absentee
ballot
either.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
i
have
no
idea.
they
can
let
a
proper
petition
be
filed
and
quite
possibly
the
court
might
take
jurisdiction
over
something
like
the
cognizance
of
the
problem
and
order
a
remedy.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
in
this
case?
absolutely
nothing,
sir.
the
only
distinction
apparently
about
the
person
being
able
to
get
out
of
the
jail
to
go
vote
if
that
becomes
a
paramount
interest
is
the
fact
that
he's
got
some
money
to
get
out
but
i
would
like
to
raise
the
question
also
what
about
the
chap
who's
got
money
and
who
doesn't
want
to
put
up
to
bail
and
he
wants
to
stay
in
jail.
now,
should
he
be
allowed
to
have
absentee
ballots?
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
mr.
justice
white,
unfortunately
i
think
that
alimony
role
is
their
call
over
a
county
jail
and
cook
county
has
loaded
with
people
who
got
some
money,
who
just
don't
want
to
pay
it
up
so
therefore
they
can't
get
out
of
jail
and
there
i
think
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there're
great
number
of
people.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
aptly
put.
i
don't
know
whether
that
would
be
a
denial
of
equal
protection.
i
certainly
don't
think
that
given
the
option
to
put
up
bail
to
go
vote,
they're
making
the
choice
themselves
as
to
whether
or
not
they
should
have
the
franchise
in
person
at
polling
place
and
having
been
giving
that
option
and
having
exercise
it
in
the
negative
that
would
be
a
denial.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
no.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
no,
and
i
very
firmly
say
no
because
i
think
that's
what
gets
to
the
point
of
this
entire
case.
will
a
statute
which
does
substantial
good
and
substantial
justice
which
does
a
statute
would
reaches
great
numbers
of
people
to
facilitate
their
casting
their
ballot,
to
exercise
of
their
franchise.
that's
the
statute
because
it
reduces
itself
to
two
persons
out
of
a
possible
2000
or
1800.
out
of
a
possible
eight
million
registered
in
the
state
of
illinois.
does
the
statute
have
to
stricken
down
as
unconstitutional
as
violative
of
equal
protection
of
the
laws
because
two
people
can't
get
out
to
vote
and
two
people
can't
make
an
application
for
absentee
ballot
under
the
law
of
illinois?
i
don't
think
so
because
if
it
is
that
to
me
the
role
--
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
having
viewed
some
of
the
legislations
coming
out
of
his
spring
field,
i
would
think
that
the
legislative
should
have
thought
about
a
lot
of
things
sir.
we
usually
have
a
phrase
in
illinois,
the
legislature
in
its
wisdom.
they
have
my
thought
of
a
lot
of
things.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
absentee
balloting?
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
i
would
think
that
absentee
balloting
in
a
penal
institution
might
as
well
be
subject
to
a
great
instance
of
fraud.
our
institutions
are
there,
are
controlled
by
political
party
candidates
or
elected
to
public
office,
share
of
cook
county.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
i
would
agree
with
the
too
and
i
think
that's
part
and
partial
of
my
argument
that
a
statute
can
never
comprehend
its
applicability
to
all
conceivable
and
imagined
cases.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
i
don't
think
a
legislature
can
be
require
to
do
that
because
if
it
is
required
to
do
so
i
don't
think
--
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
maybe
they
don't
have
a
microscope,
maybe
they
don't
have
the
wisdom
to
see
it,
maybe
they
don't
have
the
time
under
the
pressure
of
work
to
see
but
i
don't
think
a
legislature
can
be
required
to
see
even
the
most
miniscule
problems.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
that
at
all,
all
we
have
was
the
fact
that
he
was
a
duly
qualified
registered
voter
before
he
went
in
to
prison.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
what
could
he
have
done?
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
well,
statute
doesn't
say
he
could
have
done
anything
because
there
is
no
provision
for
absentee
ballot.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
yes
we
do,
he
may
have
tried
that
and
i
mention
that
i
think
i
alluded
to
it
in
the
previous
statement
and
possibly
he
could
have
gotten
someone
to
go
on
habeas
corpus
for.
mr.
bass
was
representing
him,
has
grant
this
counsel
under
grant
i
believe
there
is
a
legal
aid
service.
he
was
representing
them
on
many
matters.
he
could
have
possibly
gone
before
the
court
on
habeas
corpus
that
was
not
tried
and
all
we
had
was
this
application
that
came
in
on
the
last
possible
day
for
application
prior
to
the
election
itself.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
in
three
instances
i
believe
that
what
happened.
in
going
back
to
a
subject
that
was
raised
and
discussed
by
mr.
justice
fortas
that
relative
to
the
varying
provisions
for
absentee
ballot
in
the
various
states
of
this
union
in
speaking
with
the
solicitor
general
and
the
break
just
after
he
argued
his
case.
his
wife
received
an
absentee
ballot
in
the
state
of
massachusetts
as
a
physically
disabled
person
only
because
she
was
in
a
community
twice
removed
from
the
community
in
which
she
lived.
in
other
word,
if
she
was
in
the
town
adjacent
to
the
city
or
town
in
which
she
lived
and
was
physically
disable,
under
massachusetts
law
she
could
not
have
receive
and
absentee
ballot,
she
had
to
get
one
town
in
between
and
move
to
a
third
town
outside
to
be
able
to
get
an
absentee
ballot.
now,
if
absentee
balloting
is
going
to
be
looked
at
with
a
very
caustic
eye
to
see
whether
or
not
it
denies
equal
protection
of
the
laws
then
maybe
that
kind
of
statute
too
should
be
scrutinized
and
i
would
venture
to
say
that
in
almost
every
instance
having
studied
election
laws
at
the
various
states
being
a
member
of
illinois
election
laws
commission
staff
counsel
working
on
recatication.
i
can
see
that
if
this
case
where
to
decide,
this
court
were
to
decide
that
illinois
statute
was
unconstitutional
that
the
great
bulk
of
the
statutes
concerning
absentee
balloting
would
then
immediately
be
suspect
and
subject
to
challenge
on
the
same
ground
because
there
are
some
provisions
which
i
think
or
even
more
unfair
on
other
states
than
they
are
at
illinois.
if
this
be
unfair
at
all
assuming
argue
and
that
it
could
unfair
but
i
think
what
we
have
here
is
unintentional
omission
of
the
legislature,
no
intention,
no
malice,
no
purpose
fullness
at
all,
no
discrimination,
they're
just
a
classification
made
by
the
legislature
and
a
valid
attempt
to
extend
the
privilege
of
absentee
balloting
to
large
ascertainable
groups
of
persons
that
has
just
simply
missed
in
its
application,
one
small
and
i
might
even
add
miniscule
group
of
persons,
two
persons
is
all
we've
had
notwithstanding
the
fact
--
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
it
is
a
class
action.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
oh
i
say
two
people
because
i
think
i've
been
very
close
to
this
case
and
i
know
how
these
cases
came
about.
and
after
the
norman
bans
case,
if
moral
on
the
county
jail
of
cook
county
was
so
much
uplifted
because
of
this
decision
then
we
quite
possibly
could
have
assume
there
would
have
been
an
outpouring
of
applications
for
absentee
ballot
again,
but
then
we
only
got
mcdonald
in
mcdonald
one
to
make
an
application
and
then
only
mcdonald
and
another
person
again.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
the
case?
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
who
are
registered
voters
--
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
--
and
qualified
to
vote
at
the
time
of
an
election.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
--
and
there
may
not
be
any
such
person
at
all.
there
is
no
way
to
determine
the
existence
of
that
on
the
state
wide
basis.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
well,
i
might
assume
that
to
sir
but
there
is
no
--
what
i'm
saying
mr.
justice
marshall
is
there's
no
demonstrable
way
that
i
can
show
to
the
court
that
that
class
exist
that
this
moment
or
any
other
moment
because
you
couldn't
do
a
survey
to
determine
it.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
at
the
time
that
it
was
filed
yes,
no
question.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
as
it
was
brought
then
yes.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
i
would
assume
that,
yes
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
yes,
definite
sir.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
no,
because
they
fall
under
the
general
class
of
persons
who
are
outside
the
county
and
therefore
they
are
entitled
to
absentee
ballot
under
the
provision
of
our
statute.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
no
sir,
not
to
my
knowledge,
anyway
that
been
with
the
four
or
seven
years
ago.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
no
sir,
i
have
heard
of
none
in
the
state
and
i
think
that
i'm
probably
would
have
because
i'm
in
constant
communication
with
the
other
election
officials
of
the
state.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
none
to
my
knowledge
whatsoever.
the
only
time
this
question
is
even
started
to
come
up
was
in
norman
bans
and
then
mcdonald
one
and
on
mcdonald
two
in
which
mr.
bass
participated
on
all
three
cases,
so
that
--
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
i
would
have
no
way
of
knowing
that,
i
wish
i
could
--
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
if
the
justice
is
asking
me
for
a
quest
i
don't
think
that
the
percentage
is
going
to
be
very
high
because
we
might
have
seen
more
of
it
in
this
case
than
just
the
two
plaintiffs
that
we
have
here.
and
then
conclusion
that
its
time
misleading.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
pardon
me
sir.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
he
was
otherwise
qualified
to
vote,
yes
sir
he
was
a
duly
registered
person
qualified
to
vote
had
he
appeared
in
his
polling
place
on
election
day.
yes,
both
of
them
byrd
and
mcdonald
both.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
yes.
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
well,
i
think
the
class
gets
down
to
a
point
where
it
becomes
a
very,
very
small
class
because
not
all
persons
who
are
in
the
county
jail
are
going
to
be
21,
not
all
of
are
going
to
registered
voters.
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
or
even
residence
of
the
county
because
you
going
to
detained
in
our
county
jail
for
commission
of
a
crime
there
and
the
accusation
of
it
without
being
a
residence
the
county.
so
i
think
we
have
--
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
one
was
in
on
a
charge
of
murder
and
i
forget
what
the
other
one
was
that
mr.
bass
would
know
that
i
think
the
record
discloses
it
and
i
think
its
someone
on
the
bridge,
i
think
its
on
our
brief
--
mr.
stanley
t.
kusper,
jr.
rubbery,
right.
one
was
release
on
preliminary
hearing
and
one
that
was
tried,
got
a
hang
jury,
eventually
was
retried
and
pleaded
guilty
to
manslaughter.
we
think
--
