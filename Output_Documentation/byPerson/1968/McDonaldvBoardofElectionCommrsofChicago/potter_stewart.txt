so,
it's
going
to
be
someone
who
has
just
been
put
in
jail
the
day
or
the
two
in
court
too
before
who
will
not
be
able
to
vote
under
the
ordinary
--
justice
potter
stewart
provision
governing
all
absentee
voters.
there
must
--
there's
a
minimum
time
in
advance
within
which
you
have
to
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
apply
for
ballot,
is
there?
justice
potter
stewart
because
actually
of
general
applicability
to
call
absentee
voters
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
let
say
--
i
don't
quite
--
really,
we're
not
here
to
decide
what's
reasonable
or
unreasonable,
are
we?
justice
potter
stewart
not
because
they're
unreasonable,
are
you?
you're
assailing
him
because
you
submit
that
they
violate
the
equal
protection
clause
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution?
justice
potter
stewart
you
have
an
opportunity
to
look
at
the
--
at
the
absentee
ballot
and
laws
of
any
of
the
other
states?
justice
potter
stewart
what'd
you
find
out
with
respect
to
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
just
as
right
as
your
clients
are.
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
--
some
of
the
state
limit
the
eligibility
for
absentee
of
the
ballots
to
those
who
are
going
to
be
absent
for
specified
reasons?
justice
potter
stewart
for
business
but
not
--
but
not
for
a
vacation,
isn't
that
true?
justice
potter
stewart
so
they
will
require
the
absence
to
be
on
kind
of
business,
others
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
limit
it
or
to
use
to
at
least
to
military
and
student?
justice
potter
stewart
and
others
to
physical
incapacity
to
be
there?
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
true?
justice
potter
stewart
but
there
are
sorts
of
--
aren't
there
all
sorts
of
classifications
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
made
by
each
one
of
the
states
or
at
least
by
the
typical
state.
justice
potter
stewart
there's
no
state
is
there
that
--
that
just
says,
if
you're
not
going
to
be
here
for
any
reason.
justice
potter
stewart
maine
does
say
that.
justice
potter
stewart
how
about
the
--
under
the
laws
that
exist,
how
about
the
man
who
is
physically
incapacitated,
the
man
or
woman
who
was
physically
incapacitated
for
medical
reason?
if
he
is
in
the
county,
does
--
he
can
vote
absentee
again.
justice
potter
stewart
i'm
not
talking
about
chicago,
about
illinois.
justice
potter
stewart
and
those
are
the
only
--
those
are
the
only
two
classifications
of
people
who
are
in
the
county
on
election
day
is
those
who
are
physically
incapacitated
that
is
medically
incapacitated
or
those
who
are
observing
a
religious
holiday
who
may
get
an
absentee
ballots,
is
that
correct?
that's
the
way
i
read
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
on
a
different
precinct,
yeah.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
you
don't
have
a
case
in
which
the
state
has
explicitly
said,
we
are
going
to
deny
the
right
of
an
absentee
ballot
to
people
who
are
in
jail.
you
have
rather
than
that
--
you
have
a
case
in
which
the
state
has
said,
we
are
going
to
grant
right
of
absentee
ballots
to
people
who
are
even
though
they're
going
to
be
in
this
county
on
election
day
to
the
following
two
groups
into
these
two
groups,
three
groups
into
these
three
groups
only.
those
who
are
medically
incapacitated,
those
who
are
celebrating
their
religious
holiday,
and
those
who
because
they're
judges
or
poll
watches
or
something,
or
going
to
be
at
another
pre-voting
place.
justice
potter
stewart
and
those
are
the
only
three
groups
to
whom
we're
going
to
grant
the
right
of
absentee
voting
even
though
they
are
in
the
county
on
election
day.
you
do
no
not
have
a
case
where
the
state
at
least
any
as
explicit
are
considered
kind
of
a
way
has
said
that
we're
going
to
deny
the
right
of
absentee
ballots
even
though
we
grant
it
to
everybody
else,
we're
going
to
deny
it
for
those
who
are
in
jail.
justice
potter
stewart
you
don't
have
a
case
to
that
kind
of
discrimination
at
all.
justice
potter
stewart
no,
no
because
they
are
not
voting
for
sheriffs
over
there
not
on
the
county.
the
sheriff
of
cook
county
is
that
custodian
and
he's
the
man
who
was
a
candidate
so
there
isn't
the
same
interest.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
but
he
is
not
then
in
custody
of
the
cook
county
sheriff?
justice
potter
stewart
your
taking
to
be
witnesses
and
trials
all
the
time
i
would
say
and
nobody
has
to
go
into
witness
--
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
the
illinois
legislature?
justice
potter
stewart
it
occurred
to
you
this
might
be
a
legislative
matter.
justice
potter
stewart
so,
it's
going
to
be
someone
who
has
just
been
put
