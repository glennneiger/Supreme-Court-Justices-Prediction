justice
thurgood
marshall
have
you
made
implicate
--
have
an
intervener
so
you'd
have
a
named
party?
justice
thurgood
marshall
as
i
understand
it,
you
say
that
it
was
a
class
action,
i'm
wondering
what
is
it
now?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir.
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
were
these
people
excluded?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
don't
you
think
the
state
should
have
some
reason?
justice
thurgood
marshall
now,
do
you
think
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
think
the
states
obliged
to
tell
somebody
the
reason
you
distinguish
between
prisoners
awaiting
trial
outside
the
county
and
those
inside
the
county.
justice
thurgood
marshall
aren't
these
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
they're
different
because
they're
outside
of
the
county?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
they're
still
awaiting
trial
by
the
state
of
illinois?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
that
much
they
are
like
but
why
draw
the
line
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
can
you
think
of
a
reason?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir.
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
why
the
state
made
a
difference
a
man
in
jail
waiting
for
trial
outside
the
county
and
a
man
waiting
for
trial
inside
the
county.
when
you
finish
that,
i
want
to
know
the
different
between
a
man
out
on
bail
and
a
man
who
is
incarcerated
for
not
having
the
money
for
bail.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
mean
he
didn't
know
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
that
in
mind
as
we've
looked
at
this,
can
we
say
that
we
see
no
valid
reason
for
distinguishing
two
man
are
charged
with
a
crime,
one
has
bail
money,
the
other
man
has
no
bail
money,
they
both
committed
the
same
crime,
one
can
vote
and
the
other
one
cannot.
now,
what
reason
is
there
for
that
distinction?
justice
thurgood
marshall
aren't
you
obliged
--
aren't
you
obliged
to
give
us
a
--
something
close
to
a
reason?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
the
legislature
did
consider
the
problem
as
to
whether
or
not
people
in
jail
awaiting
trial
should
or
should
not
have
an
absentee
ballot.
the
legislature
did
consider
that,
didn't
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
who
did
draw
the
distinction?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
these
people
tried
to
file
their
absentee
ballots
and
election
commissioner
said
that
they
were
not
physically
handicapped,
isn't
that
what
happened?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
is
there
--
what
is
there
in
the
statute
that
this
did
not
comply
with?
didn't
he
say
they
were
physically
for
them
to
get
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
there's
no
question
that
this
was
state
action?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
action
of
the
commissioners,
no
question
about
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
depended
now
down
to
the
man
with
bail
money
has
a
right
to
vote,
the
man
without
money
is
denied
the
right
to
vote?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
the
right
to
vote.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
the
man
who
does
not
have
money
cannot
vote.
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
think
that's
a
valid
distinction
between
same
people?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
have
been
unable
to
at
this
point
that
this
question
to
find
any
interest
says
than
one
man
has
money
and
the
other
one
does
not.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
else
is
there
in
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
you
insist
on
the
absentee
ballot
and
that
is
on
the
right
to
vote
because
the
man
with
money
can
vote,
he
don't
need
not
to
worry
about
that
state
law.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
the
man
who
doesn't
have
money
can't
vote.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
doesn't
he
have
put
up
the
money
for
the
habeas
corpus.
justice
thurgood
marshall
leaving
that
aside,
what
do
you
have
other
than
money?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he's
just
like
the
chap
who
could
--
who
has
the
money
and
doesn't
want
to
vote,
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
isn't
this
a
class
action?
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
why
do
you
keep
saying
two
people?
justice
thurgood
marshall
hasn't
the
record
in
this
case
show
that
this
case
is
a
class
action
case
and
the
state
has
never
contested
it,
you
recognize
it
as
a
class
action
case,
am
i
correct?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
so
you
--
in
that
class
are
all
of
the
prisoners
in
the
state
of
illinois
awaiting
trial,
that's
the
class?
justice
thurgood
marshall
right.
justice
thurgood
marshall
right.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
for
one
if
there
were
two,
i
would
assume
there
might
be
a
half
or
one
more.
justice
thurgood
marshall
contest
that
was
at
the
trial
court,
you
admitted
it
was
a
class
action,
am
i
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
admitted
now
as
a
class
action.
justice
thurgood
marshall
have
you
made
implicate
--
have
an

so
you'd
have

thurgood

why

justice
thurgood

yes

justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
don't
you
think
the
state
should
have
some
reason?
justice
thurgood
marshall
now,
do
you
think
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
think
the
states
obliged
to
tell
somebody
the
reason
you
distinguish
between
prisoners
awaiting

outside
the

and
those

justice
thurgood

aren't
these
--
justice
thurgood

they're

justice
thurgood

thurgood

so
that

justice
thurgood
marshall
can
you
think
of
a

justice
thurgood

yes

justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
why
the
state
made
a
difference
a
man
in
jail
waiting
for
trial
outside
the
county
and
a
man
waiting
for
trial
inside
the
county.
when
you
finish
that,
i
want
to
know
the
different
between
a

now,
what
