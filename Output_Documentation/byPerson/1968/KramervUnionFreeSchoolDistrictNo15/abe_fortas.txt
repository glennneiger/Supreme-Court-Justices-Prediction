justice
abe
fortas
mr.
fraenkel.
mr.
fraenkel,
in
the
papers
before
us,
is
there
any
place
where
i
can
look
to
discover
what
the
powers
of
the
school
meeting
are?
in
other
words,
on
what
subjects
the
vote
would
be
cast?
is
any
comprehensive
listing
anywhere
here
in
these
papers?
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
do
you
have
conveniently
append
in
reference
to
the
sections
of
the
education
law
that
set
out
the
powers
of
the
local
school
meetings.
when
you
say
the
local
board,
do
you
mean
the
school
meeting?
justice
abe
fortas
i
notice
that
section
2012
which
was
involved
here
refers
to
voting
at
the
school
meeting
and
whatever.
justice
abe
fortas
i
really
don't
--
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
fraenkel,
i
see
on
page
on
the
opinion
below,
on
page
34
of
the
appendix
--
justice
abe
fortas
statements
that
at
this
meeting,
which
is
the
meeting
we're
talking
about,
school
meeting,
the
voters
approved
the
school
budget
--
justice
abe
fortas
and
they
vote
to
levy
taxes
on
taxable
real
properties.
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
and
that
they
also
--
the
voters
in
each
school
district
and
i
suppose
it's
at
this
meeting,
elect
from
their
number
three
to
nine
trustees,
elect
as
the
board
of
education
for
that
district?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
is
that
board
of
education
subject
to
a
statewide
board
of
education?
justice
abe
fortas
well
now,
the
opinion
below
says
that
the
board
of
education
prescribes
the
course
of
study
to
be
followed
in
the
district
schools.
do
they
have
authority
to
do
that
or
is
that
determined
by
the
statewide
board
of
regents?
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
really
i'm
reading
that
part
of
the
opinion
of
the
court
below
relating
to
the
board
of
education
of
the
particular
district,
we
should
read
that
the
board
of
education
of
that
district
subject
to
the
board
of
regents
of
the
state?
justice
abe
fortas
describes
the
courts
in
study
and
builds
schools
and
so
on.
justice
abe
fortas
could
you,
forgive
me
sir,
but
would
you
be
so
kind
as
to
tell
us
as
specifically
and
precisely
as
possible
just
what
are
the
matters
brought
before
the
school
meetings
on
which
these
qualified
people
vote.
justice
abe
fortas
no,
not
--
i'm
sorry
but
it
doesn't
quite
because
it
is
a
complicated
education
law
and
i'm
interested
in
finding
out
just
as
precisely
as
i
can
and
with
as
little
possibility
of
error
as
can
be
managed
just
what
this
voting
right
is
often
concerning?
i
know
that
it
is
a
voting
right
that
relates
to
the
election
of
members,
the
board
of
education
for
the
district.
i
know
it
is
a
voting
right
that
is
--
that
has
to
do
with
the
approval
or
disapproval
of
budget
presumably
proposed
by
the
board
of
education.
justice
abe
fortas
and
what
i
would
like
to
know
is
whether
they're
--
just
what
the
specific
subjects
are
as
to
which
mr.
fraenkel's
client
claims,
he
should
be
entitled
to
vote
and
i
haven't
found
that
in
any
of
the
papers
before
us.
there
is
a
general
description
in
the
opinion
of
the
lower
court
and
that's
all.
justice
abe
fortas
there's
a
text
to
which
the
--
which
may
be
levied
by
the
school
district,
solely
a
tax
upon
real
property.
justice
abe
fortas
where
does
that
appear
in
the
statute?
justice
abe
fortas
i've
just
gotten
a
copy
of
a
statute
brought
to
me
and
the
statute
does
not
indicate
that
it
has
to
be
a
real
property
tax,
does
it?
justice
abe
fortas
you
can't
tell
me
anything
in
this
law
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
anything
in
the
law
that
confirms
the
tax
power
of
the
school
meetings
that
we're
talking
about
to
the
levying
of
real
estate
taxes.
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
looking
section
2021.
i'm
still
trying
to
find
out
what
the
powers
of
this
meeting
are.
justice
abe
fortas
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
find
out.
justice
abe
fortas
when
it
comes
to
the
power
to
tax
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
want
to
know
specifically
in
terms
of
the
statute
whether
the
taxing
power
is
limited
to
the
levying
of
tax
on
real
property.
obviously,
the
reason
and
i'm
interested
in
that
is
that
the
section
at
issue
here
which
is
2012
confines
a
power
to
vote
to
persons
who
own
etcetera,
real
property.
