chief

the

have
had
any
of
its

do
you
have
a
sales
tax?
chief

justice
earl
warren
well,
do
these
people
who
are
deprived
of
voting
under
this
law
have
to
pay
those
state
taxes?
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
they
do
--
then
they
do

to
the

of
these

do
they
not?
chief

earl
warren

well
i
just
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
just
like
to
ask
you
if
they
are
obliged
to
pay
state
taxes
that
are
used
to
operate
the
schools.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
it
might
determine
how
much
he
would
be
willing
to
put
in
to
the
local
budget
and
wouldn't
it
depending
on
how
much
he
used
to
get
from
the
state?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
well,
might
not
a
person
whose
voting
at
this
meeting
say,
“well,
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
state
gives
this
much
money
to
the
schools
for
this
purpose.
we
don't
need
much.
we
only
need
a
very
little
bit
so
we're
only
--
we'll
only
vote
to
have
to
spend
so
much
in
the
district.”
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
know
but
he
might
say
in
view
of
the
subventions
from
a
state,
we
don't
need
these
things.
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright,
well
then,
doesn't
the
person
who
pays
the
state
taxes
also
have
an
interest
in
how
much
he
will
provide
for
the
district,
for
school
purposes?
chief
justice
earl
warren
let
me
ask
you
this
question.
let
me
ask
you
this
question,
suppose
the
appellant
in
this
case
was
a
school
teacher
instead
of
a
stock
broker
and
he
was
boarding
in
a
home,
would
you
presume
to
say
that
he
had
no
interest
in
the
public
school's
sufficient
to
enable
him
to
be
a
voter?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
let
me
ask
you
just
one
more
question
along
that
line.
a
school
teacher
or
any
other
person
not
being
a
real
property
taxpayer
who
is
retired
and
living
with
one
of
his
children,
maybe
he's
had
a
large
family
and
has
reared
them
and
put
them
through
the
public
schools,
paid
all
their
expenses
and
they
now
have
grandchildren
and
he
is
living
with
one
of
those
children.
do
you
say
that
that
person
would
not
have
sufficient
interest
in
the
public
school
system
of
his
district
to
vote?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
i'm
talking
about
this
specific
case.
you
say
that
he
had
insufficient
interest
to
vote.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that
perhaps,
i
would
ask
just
one
more
question.
you
say,
because
he
pays
no
taxes
could
you
now,
if
we
sustain
this,
could
you
also
say
that
unless
he
paid
the
$10,000.00
in
taxes
a
year
that
they
wouldn't
be
eligible
to
vote?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
let's
say
assessed
unless
he
assessed
for
that
much,
you
could
put
a
limit
on
the
amount
of
taxes
he
pays.
chief
justice

we'll
recess
now.
