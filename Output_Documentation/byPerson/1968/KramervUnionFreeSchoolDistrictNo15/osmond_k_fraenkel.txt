mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
from
the
decision
of
a
three-judge
court
in
the
eastern
district
of
new
york
rejecting
an
attack
on
the
constitutionality
of
section
2012
of
the
new
york
education
law
brought
by
this
plaintiff
representing
himself
and
others
in
the
same
class.
it
deals
with
the
qualifications
for
elections
in
local
school
districts
and
this
particular
statute
restricts
the
voting
to
roughly
two
groups
of
persons.
the
owners
or
renters
of
taxable
real
estate
and
their
spouses.
although
at
the
time
the
suit
was
brought,
the
spouse
of
a
tenant
wasn't
qualified
but
has
become
so
since
and
parents
of
children
attending
the
local
schools.
first,
excluding
persons
like
the
particular
plaintiff
who
is
a
bachelor
living
--
an
adult
of
course
living
with
his
parents
excluding
also
older
people
living
with
their
children,
excluding
lodgers
and
boarders
and
excluding
residents
of
property
which
happens
to
be
non-taxable.
the
majority
of
the
court
below
upheld
the
law
on
the
ground
that
the
interest
of
the
taxpayers
and
parents
was
more
direct
than
the
interests
of
the
other
residents
of
the
community
and
that
the
state
therefore
had
the
right
to
make
that
distinction.
judge
weinstein
wrote
a
long
and,
to
our
view
of
course,
a
most
persuasive
dissent.
now,
the
election
system
in
new
york
with
respect
to
schools
is
most
bizarre.
in
a
large
city
like
new
york,
the
school
board
is
appointed,
although
the
project
for
decentralization
of
which
the
members
of
the
court
may
have
read
and
the
new
proposal
by
the
board
of
education
which
had
been
much
publicized
would
give
all
the
residents
of
local
districts
the
right
to
elect
their
local
school
boards.
in
some
of
the
other
cities
in
new
york,
school
boards
are
elected
at
large
cities.
in
all
cities
in
new
york
having
population
of
125,000
or
less,
school
boards
are
elected
by
the
entire
electorate.
it's
only
in
the
so-called
country
and
suburban
areas
such
as
the
one
here
involved
down
on
long
island
that
there
is
this
distinction
and
restriction
to
taxpayers
and
parents.
other
state
doesn't
really
support
that
distinction
by
anything
which
in
our
view
conforms
to
this
court's
most
recent
discussion
of
the
question
of
equal
protection.
in
williams
against
rhodes
where
the
court
noted
that
we
have
to
balance
the
interest
of
the
state
in
the
exclusion
which
it
proposed
against
the
interest
of
the
person
excluded.
now,
here
the
interest
of
the
person
excluded
is
quite
obvious
be
as
a
resident
of
the
community
and
particularly
in
modern
times
where
the
growing
interest
in
education,
the
growing
ferment,
not
only
among
the
community
people
but
among
the
students
themselves
is
to
how
their
education
should
be
handled.
it
would
seem
a
priori
that
everyone
in
the
community
should
have
a
right
to
participate
in
the
election
of
the
school
officials
provided
there
be
an
election
at
all.
this
court
having
previously
of
course
has
determined
that
a
state
would
have
such
local
officials
appointed.
now,
what
does
the
state
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
yes.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
no,
there
are
meetings.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
there
are
meetings.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
there
are
meetings
at
which
the
members
of
the
school
board
are
elected
at
the
denominations
made
by
a
certain
number
of
qualified
electors.
they
make
denominations.
and
then
there
are
also
other
matters
which
can
be
disposed
of
at
these
meetings,
certain
tax
matters,
certain
matters
relating
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
out
of
state,
out
of
the
district
and
things
of
that
sort.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
so
far
as
i
know,
yes.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
only
these
people
can
vote.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
that
i
don't
know.
i
don't
know.
i
would
suppose
at
least
once
a
year
perhaps
often.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
actually
being
a
resident
of
the
city
of
new
york
and
i'm
not
too
familiar
with
what
goes
on
in
the
suburbs.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
no.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
that's
right.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
roughly
taxpayers
and
parents.
in
other
words,
the
owners
or
renter
--
owners
or
renters
of
taxable
real
property
and
their
respective
spouses.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
and
to
parents
of
children
attending
school.
no,
they
have
to
be
qualified
otherwise
to
vote
in
the
state
and
they
have
to
be
over
21.
they
have
to
be
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
citizens
and
so
on.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
no,
not
in
new
york.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
no,
no.
in
addition
to
these
restrictions
under
electorate,
the
elector
has
to
be
a
qualified
voter
in
the
state.
now,
as
i
was
saying,
i
would
suppose
that
the
interest
of
every
resident
of
the
community
is
clear.
what
interest
is
it
that
the
state
is
supposed
to
reserve
by
this
restriction?
it's
rather
difficult
from
the
papers
to
determine
what
that
is?
in
one
place,
it
is
stated
that
this
is
essential
--
an
essential
restriction
in
order
to
prevent
political
maneuvering
but
why
or
how
this
is
so
is
difficult
to
understand.
why
in
the
districts
in
the
country,
political
maneuvering
is
more
a
suspect
than
in
cities
having
under
a
125,000
persons.
is
it
made
clear
anywhere
and
in
those
cities
everybody
who
otherwise
qualified
can
vote?
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
no,
we're
dealing
here
only
with
the
question
of
equal
protection,
whether
this
is
an
improper
discrimination
by
the
state.
we're
not
dealing
of
course
with
voting
in
federal
for
federal
officials.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
or
any
constitutional
issue.
we're
dealing
with
a
matter
that
is
local
in
the
sense
that
school
elections
are
not
--
don't
deal
with
all
the
subjects
which
a
community
is
interested
in.
but
nevertheless
in
my
view,
the
matter
of
education
is
of
such
paramount
importance
that
all
members
of
the
community
have
an
interest
in
and
should
be
allowed
to
vote
borrowing
some
specific
reason.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
yes
and
no.
of
course,
always,
the
person
who
raises
an
equal
protection
point
assumes
that
burden.
on
the
other
hand,
once
he
has
shown
that
there
is
a
discrimination
and
that
he
has
a
strong
interest,
then
i
submit,
it
is
the
burden
of
the
state
to
come
forward
to
show
a
justification
for
that
discrimination.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
well,
of
course,
the
most
recent
application
of
it
was
in
the
williams-rhodes
case.
well,
i
think
it's
true
that
that
dealt
with
federal
electors
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
and
for
that
reason,
this
court
may
have
--
i
may
be
permitted
to
say
so
stretch
a
little.
nevertheless,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
basic
principle
enunciated
that
where
a
discrimination
has
been
shown
there
is
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
well,
the
normal
equal
protection
law
deals
mostly
with
taxation
and
routine
things
of
that
sort.
i
submit
that
when
it
deals
with
so
fundamentally
thing
as
voting
as
the
poll
tax
case
of
course
is
another
illustration.
now,
it's
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
oh,
generations!
it's
been
changed
from
time
to
time
by
some
amelioration
and
it
may
be
of
interest
that
when
the
constitution
was
proposed
in
new
york
in
1967,
that
constitution
would
have
expressly
forbidden
any
such
restriction
in
local
elections.
that
constitution
for
many
reasons
was
not
adopted
by
the
people
as
your
honor
knows.
now,
one
of
the
arguments
made
here
is
that
the
state
was
justified
in
making
this
discrimination
because
those
two
groups
are
likely
to
be
most
interested
and
best
informed.
it
seems
to
me,
the
short
answer
to
that
is
that
anybody
who
wants
to
vote
lives
in
the
community
shows
an
interest
and
shouldn't
be
deprived
of
that
right.
it
is
also
suggested
in
one
of
the
briefs
that
there
is
a
political
process
available
to
amend
the
law
and
that
the
law
from
time
to
time
has
been
amended.
that
may
be
true.
lord
knows,
how
long
it
might
take.
but
that
isn't
i
suggest
no
answer
at
all
to
any
constitutional
argument
in
every
case
where
a
statute
is
challenged
as
denying
the
equal
protection
clause,
it
was
of
course
possible
to
have
the
statute
amended
whether
it
was
a
tax
case
or
a
--
any
other
kind
of
a
case.
it
also
suggested
in
some
of
the
briefs
or
i
put
it
this
way,
horrible
examples
are
produced
at
least
in
one
of
the
briefs
about
what
would
happen
if
this
restriction
were
removed.
it
is
said
a
child
of
eight
from
california
would
come
and
show
an
interest.
well
that's
of
course
is
non-sense
because
the
basic
requirement
for
voting
in
new
york
is
a
certain
amount
of
residence
in
the
state
and
in
the
district.
and
that
provision
is
not
being
attacked
in
this
lawsuit.
all
that
we
are
saying
is
that
that
provision
is
to
the
general
voting
qualification
of
new
york
should
be
applicable
here.
it
is
also
suggested
that
if
this
law
is
stricken
down,
there'll
be
no
law
for
school
elections
and
that
would
produce
chaos.
now,
of
course
that
is
not
true
because
all
we
are
asking
this
court
to
do
is
to
strike
down
the
discrimination
of
the
law
and
it
is
very
easily
accomplished
because
after
the
pre
am
--
first
portion
of
the
law
which
says
persons
are
qualified
to
vote
in
school
elections
who
are
qualified
under
the
general
law
of
the
state
and
possess
certain
additional
qualifications.
all
we're
asking
is
that
the
“and
posses
these
additional
qualifications
be
stricken.”
for
that
would
leave
the
law
in
full
force
applicable
to
school
elections
in
these
districts
but
giving
the
right
to
vote
in
those
districts
to
persons
otherwise
qualified
to
vote
in
new
york.
so
in
sum,
our
position
is
that
this
plaintiff
and
other
similarly
situated
have
a
vital
interest
in
the
subject
matter
of
being
members
of
the
community
who
want
to
vote
and
participate
in
the
election
of
the
school
officials
and
that
the
mere
fact
that
taxpayers
and
parents
might
have
what
might
be
called
a
more
direct
interest
is
no
justification.
indeed,
one
of
the
briefs
go
so
far
as
to
suggest
that
if
it
were
otherwise
a
theoretical
delegate
ballots
between
the
normal
desire
of
taxpayers
to
keep
school
budgets
down
and
the
hopeful
desire
of
parents
to
have
better
education
and
better
facilities
and
therefore
increase
the
school
budgets
that
that
nice
ballots
which
might
be
preserved
by
the
existing
system
would
be
thrown
out
if
outsiders
came
in
who
were
in
need
of
financially
prejudiced
group.
whereas
on
the
contrary,
it
would
seem
to
be
in
the
general
public
interest
that
this
possible
theoretical
deadline
would
be
resolved
by
persons
having
a
general
public
interest
in
the
education
of
the
children
and
in
all
of
the
other
aspects
that
arise
in
connection
with
local
school
elections
because
there
are
various
collateral
and
what
might
be
called
fringe
aspects
to
those
situations.
the
local
school
board
has
great
power
in
connection
with
first,
the
recreation
facilities,
libraries
and
things
of
that
sort,
so
we
say
here
that
the
state
has
not
shown
anything
to
justify
this
discrimination
and
that
the
restrictive
provisions
of
other
law
should
be
stricken
by
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
the
papers
--
the
record
is
of
course
a
very
meager
record.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
it
consists
only
of
a
bad
complaint
and
a
motion
to
dismiss
for
reasons
best
known
to
itself
the
state
did
not
take
of
an
advantage
of
an
opportunity
afforded
by
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
to
bring
in
background
material.
on
the
other
hand
of
course,
the
education
law
of
the
state
is
a
matter
of
which
this
court
takes
judicial
notice
and
it
has
the
provisions
which
deal
with
these
matters
and
some
of
those
provisions
are
referred
to
in
some
detail
in
various
of
the
briefs.
in
my
own
brief,
i
preferred
to
four
or
five
sections
of
the
new
york
education
law
which
indicate
the
powers
of
the
local
boards.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
the
local
school
board
which
is
elected.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
yes
but
the
school
meeting
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
the
school
meeting
does
various
things.
it
can
as
i
indicate
in
my
brief
the
meeting
under
education
law
2021
and
2022
as
it
designates
school
sites,
2040
deals
with
the
education
of
students
outside
the
district,
2040
(a)
with
migrant
laborer's
children
and
so
on
and
some
extent
this
has
been
covered
also
in
the
opinion
of
the
three-judge
court
at
page
34
of
the
opinion
--
page
34
of
the
appendix
i
should
say.
in
any
event,
the
various
provisions
of
the
education
law
beginning
with
2012
deal
with
these
subjects.
i
call
those
that
i
thought
were
the
most
significant
but
it
may
well
be
that
some
other
significant
ones
escape
by
notice.
they
are
all
there.
they
are
the
only
thing,
there
is
no
background
material.
the
--
some
of
the
briefs
go
at
great
length
into
the
situation
and
other
parts
of
the
state.
but
again,
drawing
from
state
legislation
although
i
must
say
regretfully.
i
say
regretfully,
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
those
briefs
and
they
do
not
always
cite
the
relevant
statute
which
deals
with
the
problems.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
well,
it
involves
the
right
to
vote
at
a
school
meeting.
the
school
meeting
does
a
number
of
things.
it
can
of
course
elect
a
local
school
board.
it
also
has
the
power
as
i
pointed
out
in
my
brief
and
just
now
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
fortas'
question,
the
school
meeting
also
has
the
right
to
deal
with
certain
financial
matters,
school
houses,
education
of
children
outside
the
district
and
education
of
migrant
laborer's
children
inside
the
district.
in
other
words,
there
are
various
things
which
a
school
board
--
school
meeting
deals
with
at
which
these
people
would
then
have
the
right
to
vote,
not
merely
the
selection
of
the
members
of
the
board.
now,
it
is
pointed
out
in
one
of
the
briefs
that
if
this
court
should
agree
with
us,
perhaps
some
of
the
powers
of
these
meetings
might
be
curtailed
and
that
legislature
of
course
would
have
the
right
to
do
that
but
that
is
not
anything
with
which
i
suggest
this
court
need
concern
itself,
either
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
no,
no,
no.
the
board
of
education
presumably
would
deal
with
all
such
matters
but
of
course
the
qualified
elector
does
not
only
vote
for
members
of
the
board
but
participate
in
the
nomination
of
the
members
of
the
board.
that's
the
way
the
nominations
come
up
is
by
petition
of
qualified
voters.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
there
are
none
set
forth
that
i've
been
able
to
find
as
to
qualifications
of
the
members
of
the
board.
in
any
case
we're
not
concerned
with
that
in
this
appeal.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
do
these
meeting
have
something
to
do
with
adult
education?
well,
the
board,
i
don't
think
the
meetings
as
such.
the
board
had
something
to
do
with
determining
the
stand
of
adult
education.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
and
libraries.
those
are
within
--
after
all,
certain
basic
things
can
be
voted
on.
the
rest
is
left
through
the
discretion
of
the
board
which
is
elected
by
the
voters.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
at
these
meetings.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
yes,
sir.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
that's
right.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
those
are
the
sections
that
i
referred
to
2021.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
that's
right.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
no,
but
in
new
york,
the
supervisory
authority
over
the
whole
educational
system
is
the
board
of
regents
and
the
commissioner
of
education,
and
your
honors
may
remember
in
the
recent
new
york
city
school
crisis,
mr.
allen
commissioner
--
the
state
commissioner
of
education
intervened,
appointed
the
trustee
for
the
controversial
ocean
hill
brownsville
school
and
so
on.
they
are
the
supervisory
authority
over
the
entire
educational
system
of
the
state.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
well,
there
are
certain
state
policies
which
the
board
of
regents
lays
down.
certain
guide
rules
as
i
understand
it.
and
within
those
guide
rules,
each
local
board
has
considerable
amount
of
discretion.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
in
fact
that's
one
of
the
problems
which
we're
being
confronted
with
in
the
city
of
new
york
now
to
what
extent
shall
the
newly
proposed
local
boards
have
these
powers
such
as
to
what
extent
shall
they
be
promulgated
from
above.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
subject
to
the
general
supervisory
power
of
the
board
of
regents
and
the
commissioner
of
education.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
first,
a
specific
question
arises
about
the
propriety
of
the
action
of
the
board
of
education
by
the
--
in
a
matter
of
educational
policy
that
can
be
taken
on
appeal
to
the
commissioner
of
education
or
if
a
constitutional
principle
is
involved,
can
be
taken
directly
to
the
courts
of
the
state.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
the
commissioner
is
appointed
by
the
governor.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
sorry.
the
commissioner
is
appointed
by
the
regents,
and
the
regents
are
appointed
by
the
legislature.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
the
regents
are
appointed
by
the
legislature
and
they
--
the
regents
appoint
then
the
commissioner
of
education.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
well,
it's
certainly
is
the
most
powerful
educational
agency.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
well,
it
has
powers.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
well,
yes
but
that
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
yes
well
no.
it
has
--
i
don't
think
that
that
has
anything
to
do
with
the
legal
fraternity
but
it
has
to
do
with
doctors
and
many
other
agencies
that
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
i
think
that
--
i
think
they
have
great
powers
in
all
those
areas.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
that
i
wouldn't
know.
mr.
jehu
can
answer
that
because
he's
right
from
the
department.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
oh!
yes,
they
have
very
broad
powers.
of
course
those
powers
are
not
involved
in
this
litigation.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
well,
the
people
who
are
qualified
voters,
including
my
plaintiff
if
this
court
agrees
with
me,
can
elect
the
members
of
their
local
board.
now,
the
fact
that
that
local
board
may
be
subject
to
supervision
no
more
affects
the
situation
than
the
fact
that
in
new
york
where
the
supreme
court
justices
which
is
the
court
of
first
instance
are
elected
by
the
people.
an
appeal
can
be
taken
to
the
appellate
division
or
the
court
of
appeals
affects
the
importance
of
the
election
process
of
the
judges
so
that
he
had
a
fact
that
the
board
of
regents
can
in
some
situations
review
actions
by
the
local
boards
does
not
at
all
in
my
judgment
affect
the
importance
of
the
electorate
which
can
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
no,
i
think
the
board
can
only
--
anyway,
i
submit
that
that
is
really
not
an
issue
in
this
case.
once
the
right
--
once
the
legislature
has
said
that
a
particular
local
body
can
be
elected
then
it
seems
that
where
that
local
body
deals
with
a
fundamental
subject
such
as
education,
there
should
be
no
restrictions
on
the
body
of
electors
other
than
the
general
qualification
to
vote
in
the
state.
thank
you.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
from
the
decision
of
a
three-judge
court
in
the
eastern
district
of
new
york
rejecting
an
attack
on
the
constitutionality
of
section
2012
of
the
new
york
education
law
brought
by
this
plaintiff
representing
himself
and
others
in
the
same
class.
it
deals
with
the
qualifications
for
elections
in
local
school
districts
and
this
particular
statute
restricts
the
voting
to
roughly
two
groups
of
persons.
the
owners
or
renters
of
taxable
real
estate
and
their
spouses.
although
at
the
time
the
suit
was
brought,
the
spouse
of
a
tenant
wasn't
qualified
but
has
become
so
since
and
parents
of
children
attending
the
local
schools.
first,
excluding
persons
like
the
particular
plaintiff
who
is
a
bachelor
living
--
an
adult
of
course
living
with
his
parents
excluding
also
older
people
living
with
their
children,
excluding
lodgers
and
boarders
and
excluding
residents
of
property
which
happens
to
be
non-taxable.
the
majority
of
the
court
below
upheld
the
law
on
the
ground
that
the
interest
of
the
taxpayers
and
parents
was
more
direct
than
the
interests
of
the
other
residents
of
the
community
and
that
the
state
therefore
had
the
right
to
make
that
distinction.
judge
weinstein
wrote
a
long
and,
to
our
view
of
course,
a
most
persuasive
dissent.
now,
the
election
system
in
new
york
with
respect
to
schools
is
most
bizarre.
in
a
large
city
like
new
york,
the
school
board
is
appointed,
although
the
project
for
decentralization
of
which
the
members
of
the
court
may
have
read
and
the
new
proposal
by
the
board
of
education
which
had
been
much
publicized
would
give
all
the
residents
of
local
districts
the
right
to
elect
their
local
school
boards.
in
some
of
the
other
cities
in
new
york,
school
boards
are
elected
at
large
cities.
in
all
cities
in
new
york
having
population
of
125,000
or
less,
school
boards
are
elected
by
the
entire
electorate.
it's
only
in
the
so-called
country
and
suburban
areas
such
as
the
one
here
involved
down
on
long
island
that
there
is
this
distinction
and
restriction
to
taxpayers
and
parents.
other
state
doesn't
really
support
that
distinction
by
anything
which
in
our
view
conforms
to
this
court's
most
recent
discussion
of
the
question
of
equal
protection.
in
williams
against
rhodes
where
the
court
noted
that
we
have
to
balance
the
interest
of
the
state
in
the
exclusion
which
it
proposed
against
the
interest
of
the
person
excluded.
now,
here
the
interest
of
the
person
excluded
is
quite
obvious
be
as
a
resident
of
the
community
and
particularly
in
modern
times
where
the
growing
interest
in
education,
the
growing
ferment,
not
only
among
the
community
people
but
among
the
students
themselves
is
to
how
their
education
should
be
handled.
it
would
seem
a
priori
that
everyone
in
the
community
should
have
a
right
to
participate
in
the
election
of
the
school
officials
provided
there
be
an
election
at
all.
this
court
having
previously
of
course
has
determined
that
a
state
would
have
such
local
officials
appointed.
now,
what
does
the
state
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
yes.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
no,
there
are
meetings.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
there
are
meetings.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
there
are
meetings
at
which
the
members
of
the
school
board
are
elected
at
the
denominations
made
by
a
certain
number
of
qualified
electors.
they
make
denominations.
and
then
there
are
also
other
matters
which
can
be
disposed
of
at
these
meetings,
certain
tax
matters,
certain
matters
relating
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
out
of
state,
out
of
the
district
and
things
of
that
sort.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
so
far
as
i
know,
yes.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
only
these
people
can
vote.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
that
i
don't
know.
i
don't
know.
i
would
suppose
at
least
once
a
year
perhaps
often.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
actually
being
a
resident
of
the
city
of
new
york
and
i'm
not
too
familiar
with
what
goes
on
in
the
suburbs.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
no.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
that's
right.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
roughly
taxpayers
and
parents.
in
other
words,
the
owners
or
renter
--
owners
or
renters
of
taxable
real
property
and
their
respective
spouses.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
and
to
parents
of
children
attending
school.
no,
they
have
to
be
qualified
otherwise
to
vote
in
the
state
and
they
have
to
be
over
21.
they
have
to
be
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
citizens
and
so
on.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
no,
not
in
new
york.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
no,
no.
in
addition
to
these
restrictions
under
electorate,
the
elector
has
to
be
a
qualified
voter
in
the
state.
now,
as
i
was
saying,
i
would
suppose
that
the
interest
of
every
resident
of
the
community
is
clear.
what
interest
is
it
that
the
state
is
supposed
to
reserve
by
this
restriction?
it's
rather
difficult
from
the
papers
to
determine
what
that
is?
in
one
place,
it
is
stated
that
this
is
essential
--
an
essential
restriction
in
order
to
prevent
political
maneuvering
but
why
or
how
this
is
so
is
difficult
to
understand.
why
in
the
districts
in
the
country,
political
maneuvering
is
more
a
suspect
than
in
cities
having
under
a
125,000
persons.
is
it
made
clear
anywhere
and
in
those
cities
everybody
who
otherwise
qualified
can
vote?
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
no,
we're
dealing
here
only
with
the
question
of
equal
protection,
whether
this
is
an
improper
discrimination
by
the
state.
we're
not
dealing
of
course
with
voting
in
federal
for
federal
officials.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
or
any
constitutional
issue.
we're
dealing
with
a
matter
that
is
local
in
the
sense
that
school
elections
are
not
--
don't
deal
with
all
the
subjects
which
a
community
is
interested
in.
but
nevertheless
in
my
view,
the
matter
of
education
is
of
such
paramount
importance
that
all
members
of
the
community
have
an
interest
in
and
should
be
allowed
to
vote
borrowing
some
specific
reason.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
yes
and
no.
of
course,
always,
the
person
who
raises
an
equal
protection
point
assumes
that
burden.
on
the
other
hand,
once
he
has
shown
that
there
is
a
discrimination
and
that
he
has
a
strong
interest,
then
i
submit,
it
is
the
burden
of
the
state
to
come
forward
to
show
a
justification
for
that
discrimination.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
well,
of
course,
the
most
recent
application
of
it
was
in
the
williams-rhodes
case.
well,
i
think
it's
true
that
that
dealt
with
federal
electors
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
and
for
that
reason,
this
court
may
have
--
i
may
be
permitted
to
say
so
stretch
a
little.
nevertheless,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
basic
principle
enunciated
that
where
a
discrimination
has
been
shown
there
is
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
well,
the
normal
equal
protection
law
deals
mostly
with
taxation
and
routine
things
of
that
sort.
i
submit
that
when
it
deals
with
so
fundamentally
thing
as
voting
as
the
poll
tax
case
of
course
is
another
illustration.
now,
it's
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
oh,
generations!
it's
been
changed
from
time
to
time
by
some
amelioration
and
it
may
be
of
interest
that
when
the
constitution
was
proposed
in
new
york
in
1967,
that
constitution
would
have
expressly
forbidden
any
such
restriction
in
local
elections.
that
constitution
for
many
reasons
was
not
adopted
by
the
people
as
your
honor
knows.
now,
one
of
the
arguments
made
here
is
that
the
state
was
justified
in
making
this
discrimination
because
those
two
groups
are
likely
to
be
most
interested
and
best
informed.
it
seems
to
me,
the
short
answer
to
that
is
that
anybody
who
wants
to
vote
lives
in
the
community
shows
an
interest
and
shouldn't
be
deprived
of
that
right.
it
is
also
suggested
in
one
of
the
briefs
that
there
is
a
political
process
available
to
amend
the
law
and
that
the
law
from
time
to
time
has
been
amended.
that
may
be
true.
lord
knows,
how
long
it
might
take.
but
that
isn't
i
suggest
no
answer
at
all
to
any
constitutional
argument
in
every
case
where
a
statute
is
challenged
as
denying
the
equal
protection
clause,
it
was
of
course
possible
to
have
the
statute
amended
whether
it
was
a
tax
case
or
a
--
any
other
kind
of
a
case.
it
also
suggested
in
some
of
the
briefs
or
i
put
it
this
way,
horrible
examples
are
produced
at
least
in
one
of
the
briefs
about
what
would
happen
if
this
restriction
were
removed.
it
is
said
a
child
of
eight
from
california
would
come
and
show
an
interest.
well
that's
of
course
is
non-sense
because
the
basic
requirement
for
voting
in
new
york
is
a
certain
amount
of
residence
in
the
state
and
in
the
district.
and
that
provision
is
not
being
attacked
in
this
lawsuit.
all
that
we
are
saying
is
that
that
provision
is
to
the
general
voting
qualification
of
new
york
should
be
applicable
here.
it
is
also
suggested
that
if
this
law
is
stricken
down,
there'll
be
no
law
for
school
elections
and
that
would
produce
chaos.
now,
of
course
that
is
not
true
because
all
we
are
asking
this
court
to
do
is
to
strike
down
the
discrimination
of
the
law
and
it
is
very
easily
accomplished
because
after
the
pre
am
--
first
portion
of
the
law
which
says
persons
are
qualified
to
vote
in
school
elections
who
are
qualified
under
the
general
law
of
the
state
and
possess
certain
additional
qualifications.
all
we're
asking
is
that
the
“and
posses
these
additional
qualifications
be
stricken.”
for
that
would
leave
the
law
in
full
force
applicable
to
school
elections
in
these
districts
but
giving
the
right
to
vote
in
those
districts
to
persons
otherwise
qualified
to
vote
in
new
york.
so
in
sum,
our
position
is
that
this
plaintiff
and
other
similarly
situated
have
a
vital
interest
in
the
subject
matter
of
being
members
of
the
community
who
want
to
vote
and
participate
in
the
election
of
the
school
officials
and
that
the
mere
fact
that
taxpayers
and
parents
might
have
what
might
be
called
a
more
direct
interest
is
no
justification.
indeed,
one
of
the
briefs
go
so
far
as
to
suggest
that
if
it
were
otherwise
a
theoretical
delegate
ballots
between
the
normal
desire
of
taxpayers
to
keep
school
budgets
down
and
the
hopeful
desire
of
parents
to
have
better
education
and
better
facilities
and
therefore
increase
the
school
budgets
that
that
nice
ballots
which
might
be
preserved
by
the
existing
system
would
be
thrown
out
if
outsiders
came
in
who
were
in
need
of
financially
prejudiced
group.
whereas
on
the
contrary,
it
would
seem
to
be
in
the
general
public
interest
that
this
possible
theoretical
deadline
would
be
resolved
by
persons
having
a
general
public
interest
in
the
education
of
the
children
and
in
all
of
the
other
aspects
that
arise
in
connection
with
local
school
elections
because
there
are
various
collateral
and
what
might
be
called
fringe
aspects
to
those
situations.
the
local
school
board
has
great
power
in
connection
with
first,
the
recreation
facilities,
libraries
and
things
of
that
sort,
so
we
say
here
that
the
state
has
not
shown
anything
to
justify
this
discrimination
and
that
the
restrictive
provisions
of
other
law
should
be
stricken
by
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
the
papers
--
the
record
is
of
course
a
very
meager
record.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
it
consists
only
of
a
bad
complaint
and
a
motion
to
dismiss
for
reasons
best
known
to
itself
the
state
did
not
take
of
an
advantage
of
an
opportunity
afforded
by
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
to
bring
in
background
material.
on
the
other
hand
of
course,
the
education
law
of
the
state
is
a
matter
of
which
this
court
takes
judicial
notice
and
it
has
the
provisions
which
deal
with
these
matters
and
some
of
those
provisions
are
referred
to
in
some
detail
in
various
of
the
briefs.
in
my
own
brief,
i
preferred
to
four
or
five
sections
of
the
new
york
education
law
which
indicate
the
powers
of
the
local
boards.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
the
local
school
board
which
is
elected.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
yes
but
the
school
meeting
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
the
school
meeting
does
various
things.
it
can
as
i
indicate
in
my
brief
the
meeting
under
education
law
2021
and
2022
as
it
designates
school
sites,
2040
deals
with
the
education
of
students
outside
the
district,
2040
(a)
with
migrant
laborer's
children
and
so
on
and
some
extent
this
has
been
covered
also
in
the
opinion
of
the
three-judge
court
at
page
34
of
the
opinion
--
page
34
of
the
appendix
i
should
say.
in
any
event,
the
various
provisions
of
the
education
law
beginning
with
2012
deal
with
these
subjects.
i
call
those
that
i
thought
were
the
most
significant
but
it
may
well
be
that
some
other
significant
ones
escape
by
notice.
they
are
all
there.
they
are
the
only
thing,
there
is
no
background
material.
the
--
some
of
the
briefs
go
at
great
length
into
the
situation
and
other
parts
of
the
state.
but
again,
drawing
from
state
legislation
although
i
must
say
regretfully.
i
say
regretfully,
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
those
briefs
and
they
do
not
always
cite
the
relevant
statute
which
deals
with
the
problems.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
well,
it
involves
the
right
to
vote
at
a
school
meeting.
the
school
meeting
does
a
number
of
things.
it
can
of
course
elect
a
local
school
board.
it
also
has
the
power
as
i
pointed
out
in
my
brief
and
just
now
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
fortas'
question,
the
school
meeting
also
has
the
right
to
deal
with
certain
financial
matters,
school
houses,
education
of
children
outside
the
district
and
education
of
migrant
laborer's
children
inside
the
district.
in
other
words,
there
are
various
things
which
a
school
board
--
school
meeting
deals
with
at
which
these
people
would
then
have
the
right
to
vote,
not
merely
the
selection
of
the
members
of
the
board.
now,
it
is
pointed
out
in
one
of
the
briefs
that
if
this
court
should
agree
with
us,
perhaps
some
of
the
powers
of
these
meetings
might
be
curtailed
and
that
legislature
of
course
would
have
the
right
to
do
that
but
that
is
not
anything
with
which
i
suggest
this
court
need
concern
itself,
either
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
no,
no,
no.
the
board
of
education
presumably
would
deal
with
all
such
matters
but
of
course
the
qualified
elector
does
not
only
vote
for
members
of
the
board
but
participate
in
the
nomination
of
the
members
of
the
board.
that's
the
way
the
nominations
come
up
is
by
petition
of
qualified
voters.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
there
are
none
set
forth
that
i've
been
able
to
find
as
to
qualifications
of
the
members
of
the
board.
in
any
case
we're
not
concerned
with
that
in
this
appeal.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
do
these
meeting
have
something
to
do
with
adult
education?
well,
the
board,
i
don't
think
the
meetings
as
such.
the
board
had
something
to
do
with
determining
the
stand
of
adult
education.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
and
libraries.
those
are
within
--
after
all,
certain
basic
things
can
be
voted
on.
the
rest
is
left
through
the
discretion
of
the
board
which
is
elected
by
the
voters.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
at
these
meetings.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
yes,
sir.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
that's
right.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
those
are
the
sections
that
i
referred
to
2021.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
that's
right.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
no,
but
in
new
york,
the
supervisory
authority
over
the
whole
educational
system
is
the
board
of
regents
and
the
commissioner
of
education,
and
your
honors
may
remember
in
the
recent
new
york
city
school
crisis,
mr.
allen
commissioner
--
the
state
commissioner
of
education
intervened,
appointed
the
trustee
for
the
controversial
ocean
hill
brownsville
school
and
so
on.
they
are
the
supervisory
authority
over
the
entire
educational
system
of
the
state.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
well,
there
are
certain
state
policies
which
the
board
of
regents
lays
down.
certain
guide
rules
as
i
understand
it.
and
within
those
guide
rules,
each
local
board
has
considerable
amount
of
discretion.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
in
fact
that's
one
of
the
problems
which
we're
being
confronted
with
in
the
city
of
new
york
now
to
what
extent
shall
the
newly
proposed
local
boards
have
these
powers
such
as
to
what
extent
shall
they
be
promulgated
from
above.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
subject
to
the
general
supervisory
power
of
the
board
of
regents
and
the
commissioner
of
education.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
first,
a
specific
question
arises
about
the
propriety
of
the
action
of
the
board
of
education
by
the
--
in
a
matter
of
educational
policy
that
can
be
taken
on
appeal
to
the
commissioner
of
education
or
if
a
constitutional
principle
is
involved,
can
be
taken
directly
to
the
courts
of
the
state.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
the
commissioner
is
appointed
by
the
governor.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
sorry.
the
commissioner
is
appointed
by
the
regents,
and
the
regents
are
appointed
by
the
legislature.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
the
regents
are
appointed
by
the
legislature
and
they
--
the
regents
appoint
then
the
commissioner
of
education.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
well,
it's
certainly
is
the
most
powerful
educational
agency.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
well,
it
has
powers.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
well,
yes
but
that
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
yes
well
no.
it
has
--
i
don't
think
that
that
has
anything
to
do
with
the
legal
fraternity
but
it
has
to
do
with
doctors
and
many
other
agencies
that
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
i
think
that
--
i
think
they
have
great
powers
in
all
those
areas.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
that
i
wouldn't
know.
mr.
jehu
can
answer
that
because
he's
right
from
the
department.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
oh!
yes,
they
have
very
broad
powers.
of
course
those
powers
are
not
involved
in
this
litigation.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
well,
the
people
who
are
qualified
voters,
including
my
plaintiff
if
this
court
agrees
with
me,
can
elect
the
members
of
their
local
board.
now,
the
fact
that
that
local
board
may
be
subject
to
supervision
no
more
affects
the
situation
than
the
fact
that
in
new
york
where
the
supreme
court
justices
which
is
the
court
of
first
instance
are
elected
by
the
people.
an
appeal
can
be
taken
to
the
appellate
division
or
the
court
of
appeals
affects
the
importance
of
the
election
process
of
the
judges
so
that
he
had
a
fact
that
the
board
of
regents
can
in
some
situations
review
actions
by
the
local
boards
does
not
at
all
in
my
judgment
affect
the
importance
of
the
electorate
which
can
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
no,
i
think
the
board
can
only
--
anyway,
i
submit
that
that
is
really
not
an
issue
in
this
case.
once
the
right
--
once
the
legislature
has
said
that
a
particular
local
body
can
be
elected
then
it
seems
that
where
that
local
body
deals
with
a
fundamental
subject
such
as
education,
there
should
be
no
restrictions
on
the
body
of
electors
other
than
the
general
qualification
to
vote
in
the
state.
thank
you.
