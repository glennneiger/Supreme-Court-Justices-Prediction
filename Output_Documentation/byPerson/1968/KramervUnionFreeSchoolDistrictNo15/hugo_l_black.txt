then
that's
on

and
the

justice

well,
i
had
occasionally
looked
into
it
several
years
ago
and
wrote
about
it
in
the
case
and
of
course,
it's
pretty
broad.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
it
seems
to
me
like
it's
all
subject
to
board
like
that
the
people
have
nothing
in
the
world
to
do
with
its
election.
it
might
have
something
to
do
with
the
question
you're
raising.
maybe
i'm
wrong.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
think
it
comes
to
mind
because
it
sounds
to
me
like
what
i
read
about
that
regent
--
board
of
regents,
your
words
subject
to
supervision
by
the
board
of
regents
is
a
rather
euphemistic
term.
