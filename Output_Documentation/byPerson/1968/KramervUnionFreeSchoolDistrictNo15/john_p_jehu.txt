mr.
john
p.
jehu
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
very
important
case
i
believe
and
it
also
i
believe
were
one
of
the
first
impressions.
it
involves
such
matters
as
the
relationship
between
the
state
and
the
federal
government
and
also
between
the
judiciary
and
legislative
branches.
now,
perhaps
in
answer
to
some
of
the
questions,
the
questions
i
asked
of
mr.
fraenkel,
i
should
say
this
that
boards
of
education
and
school
districts
in
the
state
of
new
york
are
autonomous
units.
the
statute
sets
for
instance
the
requirements
as
to
required
subjects
in
the
curriculum.
beyond
that,
the
local
board
of
education
can
determine
to
have
other
subject
in
their
choice
and
the
board
of
regents
under
commission
of
education
of
course
have
supervisory
powers.
the
commissioner
of
education
has
particularly
the
judicial
powers
over
the
school
system
where
regular
pleadings
and
oral
arguments
and
briefs
are
filed
and
so
forth
and
then
the
local,
the
statutes
in
new
york
says,
his
decisions
are
final
and
not
subject
to
review.
now,
the
courts
of
the
state
however
have
happily
reviewed
them
all
along.
but
in
any
event,
the
districts
are
very
autonomous.
there
is
over
800
school
districts
in
the
state
and
the
statute
here
2012
and
i
might
add
to
that
also
requires
three
general
qualifications
together
with
one
of
three
specials.
the
three
generals
are
residence,
citizenship
and
majority.
in
addition
to
that,
one
of
three
qualifications
have
to
bring
a
qualified
vote
to
be
qualified
into
the
community
of
interest
in
the
school
system
which
is
a
special
purpose
administrative
not
legislative
units
only
it
does
administer
to
schools.
under
the
jurisdiction,
general
jurisdiction
of
the
education
department
because
under
the
state
constitution
and
the
law
in
new
york,
education
is
a
state
function
as
it
is
under
the
tenth
amendment
is
a
state
function.
now,
to
go
into
the
problem
of
this
particular
case,
this
is
a
matter
as
i
said
under
the
tenth
amendment
of
state
concern
only.
there
is
nothing
in
the
united
states
constitution
or
in
any
act
of
congress
that
guarantees
to
anybody
in
this
country
the
right
to
vote
in
school
district
meetings
or
elections.
and
an
answer
incidentally
to
mr.
justice
stewart's
question
before,
the
voting
takes
place
either
at
meetings,
town
meeting
types
or
at
election
types
which
is
up
to
the
local
board
as
which
as
they
are
the
one
going
to
handle
it.
they
can
put
up
a
ballot
box
--
mr.
john
p.
jehu
well,
it
says
--
mr.
john
p.
jehu
it
may
well
be
so
your
honor.
i'm
not
sure
about
that.
we
have
always
read
about
that
in
meetings
or
elections
--
mr.
john
p.
jehu
the
statute
itself
i
think
is
set
forth
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
below.
it's
in
the
appendix
i
do
believe.
yes.
well,
in
any
event
your
honor
--
mr.
john
p.
jehu
page
2
of
the
appellant's
brief.
the
statute
is
quoted.
the
person
shall
be
entitled
to
vote
at
any
school
meeting
for
the
election
of
school
district
officer
who
might
also
in
other
matters
which
may
be
brought
before
such
meetings
then
it
goes
on
to
a
(inaudible).
we
have
it
in
here.
it's
on
page
4
of
the
appendix
your
honor.
it
says,
a
person
shall
be
entitled
to
vote
at
any
school
meeting
for
the
election
of
school
district
officers
and
that
all
other
matters
which
may
be
brought
before
such
meeting
and
so
forth.
but
other
section
of
the
education
law
parenthesis
2035
authorizes
them
to
use
voting
machines
if
that's
all
see
fit
and
if
they
can
rent
them
from
the
counter
village
of
county
and
they
often
times
do
especially
in
the
larger
districts
to
say
it
then.
mr.
john
p.
jehu
it
is
modified
for
other
sections
of
the
education
law,
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
john
p.
jehu
that's
correct
your
honor
and
in
the
so-called
--
mr.
john
p.
jehu
the
smaller
cities,
that's
correct
and
between
the
two
groups
of
city
school
districts
as
more
than
two-thirds
of
the
population
of
the
states,
some
11
million
people
by
the
1960
census.
so
that
this
is
a
fairly
limited
group
on
law,
there
are
number
of
districts
involved.
some
are
very
small.
some
of
these
geographical
units
are
very
tiny.
this
is
one
of
our
problems
to
try
to
get
them
together
but
this
is
not
the
problem
here.
now,
i'm
trying
to
say
is
this
--
mr.
john
p.
jehu
yes,
your
honor.
the
first
thing
that
--
they
will
have
to
have
an
annual
meeting.
this
is
a
requirement
of
law.
every
one
of
these
districts
involved
here
has
to
have
an
annual
meeting.
this
takes
place
either
on
may
or
in
june
or
july
by
local
action.
first
thing
they'll
do
is
they
elect
a
board
of
education
or
there's
a
member
each
year
or
two
members
or
whatever
the
rotation
happens
to
be.
secondly,
they
must
adopt
a
budget
for
the
operating
expenses
of
the
district
for
the
ensuing
year.
in
addition
to
that,
they
can
have
any
number
of
other
resolutions
such
as
purchase
of
a
school
bus
or
the
building
of
some
extra
classrooms
as
they
may
be
required
or
the
putting
up
of
a
brand
new
building.
they're
all
matters
of
the
administration
of
the
school
system,
of
the
local
school
system
for
the
students
that
are
residing
in
the
district
and
to
take
care
of
their
particular
problems.
now,
the
board
of
education
which
is
elected
there
has
certain
powers
and
the
powers
of
the
board
of
education
are
set
forth
in
1709
of
the
education
law
the
powers
of
the
voters
on
2021
basically
but
there's
various
provisions
all
over
the
education
law
some
2000
sections
altogether
and
it's
a
very
complicated
statute
which
right
now,
we
have
joint
legislative
committee
to
try
and
revise
and
simplify
but
--
does
that
answer
your
question,
your
honor?
mr.
john
p.
jehu
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
p.
jehu
well,
section
2021
your
honor
consists
of
some
20
or
30
subdivisions
which
indicate
the
powers
of
the
voters.
first,
they
have
the
power
to
regulate
the
affairs
of
the
meeting
itself.
they
have
a
power
to
vote
taxes
for
various
things.
there's
another
section
416
of
the
education
law
which
says
that
the
voters
have
a
power
to
levy
taxes,
for
teacher
salaries,
for
the
building
of
school
buildings,
for
the
buying
of
school
buses,
for
the
buying
of
school
property,
for
playing
fields
and
whatever
the
multi-various
purposes
of
a
school
system
are.
they
have
to
hire
janitors
which
is
done
by
the
board
of
education
but
the
money
therefore
is
a
appropriated
by
the
voters.
and
to
some
extent,
teachers'
salaries
and
the
group
of
items
known
as
ordinary
contention
expenses
which
is
light,
heat,
water,
telephone,
that
sort
of
thing,
the
board
of
education
has
the
power
to
do
that
without
reference
to
the
voters
and
if
the
voters
vote
it
down,
the
board
still
does
it
because
it
has
to
--
the
schools
have
to
be
kept
running.
now,
this
is
a
constitutional
requirement
under
section
1
of
article
11
of
the
state
constitution
but
in
other
words,
all
these
voters
do
really,
this
is
the
gist
of
it.
there
are
many,
many
details
is
that
they
must
prepare,
authorize
appropriate
money
so
that
the
schools
can
be
kept
running.
there's
any
number
of
things
now
of
course
with
machine
being
used
for
various
data
processing
and
all
kinds
of
things
whatever
it
takes
to
run
the
schools
and
that's
all.
they
have
no
power
beyond
that.
mr.
john
p.
jehu
that's
correct,
your
honor.
it's
the
real
property
taxes
--
mr.
john
p.
jehu
excuse
me
sir?
mr.
john
p.
jehu
well,
the
tax
provisions
were
taken
out
of
the
state
education
law
many
years
ago
and
put
into
the
real
property
tax
law
and
they
would
be
in
article
13
of
the
real
property
tax
law
has
all
the
different
provisions
but
all
they
have
is
a
power
to
levy
a
tax
on
real
property.
certain
city
school
districts
have
the
right
to
levy
a
utility
tax
of
up
3%.
mr.
john
p.
jehu
in
the
education
law,
your
honor?
mr.
john
p.
jehu
well,
as
i
indicate
your
honor,
this
is
no
longer
in
the
education
law.
it's
in
the
real
property
tax
law
which
is
a
different
volume
of
the
consolidated
law.
mr.
john
p.
jehu
well,
the
powers
of
the
meeting
basically
--
mr.
john
p.
jehu
are
to
--
mr.
john
p.
jehu
yes.
mr.
john
p.
jehu
right.
well,
the
power
to
tax
is
limited
in
answer
to
your
honor's
question
absolutely
and
definitely
to
the
real
property
taxes.
now,
but
that
is
not
in
the
education
law
but
it's
in
another
statute
that
the
matter
was
transferred
to
starting
in
section
13
under
the
real
property
tax
law.
i
don't
know
--
the
moment
they
remember
which
one
of
the
three
or
four
sections
following
1300
of
these.
mr.
john
p.
jehu
the
operations
of
the
school
districts
of
the
state
are
financed
basically
from
the
school
tax
which
is
a
real
property
tax.
in
addition
to
that,
they
get
a
great
amount
of
state
aid,
and
that
state
aid
and
this
will
be
part
of
my
argument
about
some
of
the
claims
made
here,
that
state
aid
is
derived
from
a
number
of
sources,
the
state
income
tax,
various
cooperation
taxes
and
as
a
whole
flock
of
sources
that
budget
is
made
up.
mr.
john
p.
jehu
there
are
--
mr.
john
p.
jehu
we
have
a
state
sales
tax
now,
that's
correct
which
is
also
is
part
of
that
and
they
have
local
sales
tax
just
like
in
new
york
city
and
some
of
the
counties
have
sales
taxes.
mr.
john
p.
jehu
but
all
these
things
go
into
the
state
budget
and
before
that
budget
is
made
up,
a
new
formula
is
made
up,
state
aid
formula
is
made
up
almost
every
year,
and
that
formula
determines
how
much
the
taxes
will
have
to
be
brought
into
the
state
conference
in
order
to
cover
the
various
expenses
including
education.
mr.
john
p.
jehu
oh!
indeed
they
do,
your
honor
but
that
is
the
main
part
--
mr.
john
p.
jehu
and
the
main
part
if
it
please
chief
justice,
my
argument
is
this
--
mr.
john
p.
jehu
no,
on
this
point
is
what
i
mean.
mr.
john
p.
jehu
that's
absolutely
correct
and
some
of
their
federal
taxes
go
into
that
picture
but
what
i'm
getting
at
is
that
he
has
never
lost
and
does
not
now
lose
his
franchise
on
state
legislation
which
determines
how
much
of
his
tax
money
goes
into
the
education
system
and
he
has
not
lost
his
franchise
to
elect
a
senator
of
the
united
states
or
congressman
who
would
in
turn
determine
how
much
federal
money
goes
back
to
the
states
for
schools.
this
he
can
vote
and
this
i
think
is
a
vital
distinction
of
this
case
from
some
other
cases
the
court
has
recently
decided.
mr.
john
p.
jehu
no.
mr.
john
p.
jehu
as
i
say
the
--
mr.
john
p.
jehu
this
--
the
whole
state
aide
formula
is
the
most
complicated
kind
of
a
machinery
and
what
the
voters
do,
they
merely
authorize
that
district
to
spend,
shall
we
say,
$5
million
for
their
schools.
mr.
john
p.
jehu
and
that
that
authorization
to
spend
then
has
to
be
covered
by
an
estimate
of
how
much
state
aid
will
they
get,
how
much
federal
aid
will
they
get,
how
much
will
they
get
from
other
various
source
of
income
such
tuition
and
so
forth.
and
then
they
deduct
that
and
the
difference,
the
board
of
education
levies
some
taxes
on
the
real
property
in
the
district.
mr.
john
p.
jehu
well,
the
vote
your
honor
is
not
on
the
total
amount.
the
vote
is
on
the
authorization
of
specific
items
for
certain
purposes.
mr.
john
p.
jehu
oh!
there's
no
question
your
honor
that
this
whole
system
has
caused
difficulties
in
the
state.
mr.
john
p.
jehu
i
don't
think
your
honor.
i
don't
think
that's
all
because
he
has
to
pay
the
state
on
federal
taxes
regardless
of
whether
it
will
spend
on
this
district
or
whether
it
will
go
to
oklahoma
or
california.
if
that
district
doesn't
spend
it,
somebody
will
and
the
total
amount
is
the
same
either
way.
mr.
john
p.
jehu
well,
may
i
explain
--
mr.
john
p.
jehu
may
i
explain
this.
mr.
john
p.
jehu
this
may
well
be
one
of
the
reasons.
mr.
john
p.
jehu
because
he
is
not
a
member
of
the
community
of
interest.
mr.
john
p.
jehu
no.
may
i
state
that
--
mr.
john
p.
jehu
no,
that
would
be
an
invidious
discrimination.
mr.
john
p.
jehu
because
there
is
no
relation
between
the
purpose
of
the
statutory
objective
of
the
legislature
and
the
way
they're
doing
it.
in
other
words,
the
democrat
is
--
mr.
john
p.
jehu
well,
he's
not
being
excluded
because
he's
a
bachelor
he
is
excluded
because
he
has
absolutely
no
--
mr.
john
p.
jehu
no,
he
is
excluded
because
he
has
absolutely
no
interest
in
the
operations
of
the
school
system.
mr.
john
p.
jehu
his
children
are
not
affected
because
he
has
no
children,
whatever
--
mr.
john
p.
jehu
just
a
moment,
if
i
may
your
honor.
the
first
part
is
the
fact
he
has
no
children.
in
other
words,
whether
he
votes
for
or
against
something,
if
he
could
it
wouldn't
affect
him
since
he
has
none.
now,
the
other
thing
is,
it
doesn't
cost
him
a
penny
from
the
real
property
tax
which
is
the
only
thing
--
the
direct
taxation
that
he
can
vote
on.
he
can
vote
on
how
much
the
district
gets
or
how
much
federal
aid.
that
is
taken
care
of
by
his
use
of
the
ballot,
by
electing
state
and
federal
legislators
who
will
determine
that
for
him.
there,
he
has
a
full
ballot.
mr.
john
p.
jehu
he
could
vote,
absolutely.
mr.
john
p.
jehu
well,
they
--
mr.
john
p.
jehu
right.
mr.
john
p.
jehu
well,
the
question
really
your
honor
is
this.
in
the
first
place,
do
we
have
to
meet
a
test
such
as
we
had
in
the
cardona
case?
now,
in
cardona,
we
have
this
mrs.
cardona
who
was
disfranchised
by
the
statute
and
she
could
not
in
any
way
do
anything
about
it
because
being
disfranchised
you
have
no
access
to
the
franchise
to
change
that
statute.
here
on
the
other
hand,
we
have
a
person
who
is
not
disfranchised
on
state
legislation.
if
he
wants
to
change
that
2012,
he
can
go
and
vote
for
people
who
will
go
and
change
it.
and
i
might
say
in
this
connection,
while
this
lawsuit
was
going
on,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
some
of
the
things
that
were
criticized
below
have
been
amended.
the
spouse
of
the
tenant
which
judge
weinstein
said
should
not
be
excluded
and
i
think
judge
hayes
have
long
since
been
put
in
by
the
legislature
and
that
the
statement
was
made,
there
are
so
few
of
these
people
that
the
legislative
processes
will
not
be
adequate.
and
at
the
same
time,
it
was
done
and
we
have,
as
i
point
out
on
our
supplemental
brief
there
is
now
a
constitutional
amendment
again
before
the
state
legislature
to
eliminate
all
these
special
things
but
the
purpose
of
it
and
this
is
to
answer
your
question
mr.
justice
marshall.
in
order
for
the
legislature
to
make
sure
that
this
extremely
important
business
of
elementary
and
secondary
education
is
properly
determined
under
local
basis
where
it
has
to
be
determined
under
state
law.
he
must
make
sure
that
those
people
who
get
the
franchise
on
that
are
those
people
who
can
reasonably
be
expected
to
be
interested
enough
in
it,
to
spend
the
considerable
amount
of
time
necessary
to
really
inform
yourself
on
these
very
complicated
questions.
mr.
john
p.
jehu
may
i
make
two
answers
to
that
your
honor.
one
is
the
mere
fact
that
he's
interested
and
knowledgeable
for
all
know,
he
may
have
written
all
the
books
in
education
but
the
legislature
cannot
anticipate
when
they
make
this
rule
that
those
persons
who
are
not
in
the
category,
that
were
the
two
categories
we're
talking
about,
will
have
naturally
and
foreseeably
the
kind
of
interest
which
will
guarantee
a
reasonable
decision
on
school
matters.
mr.
john
p.
jehu
i
would
say
your
honor
that
they're
properly
excluded
here
because
the
parents
themselves
is
the
--
if
they
have
the
children,
the
people
you're
talking
about
whose
grandchildren
do
have
the
franchise
but
the
interest
of
these
other
people
is
purely
theoretical
just
like
i
have
a
tremendous
interest
in
good
education
in
mississippi
right
now.
mr.
john
p.
jehu
unless
he
is
assessed
for
a
school
tax.
if
he
rents
a
garage
for
instance
or
if
he
owns
a
home
then
obviously
he
has
the
kind
of
interest
that
the
legislature
reasonably
can
be
expected
to
base
a
decision
on
as
to
who
should
vote
and
who
should
not.
mr.
john
p.
jehu
your
honor,
isn't
it
the
question
of
payment
of
taxes.
all
he
has
to
be
is
assessed.
now,
if
he
for
instance
refused
to
pay
taxes,
being
assessed,
he
may
not
lose
his
property
for
two
years.
he
still
votes
all
this
time.
mr.
john
p.
jehu
if
that
did
that
your
honor
we
will
run
into
harbor
and
properly
so
that
would
be
impermissible
because
wealth
as
you
had
pointed
out
in
harbor
has
no
relation
to
the
use
of
the
franchise.
this
is
put
in
merely
to
make
sure
that
we
have
those
people,
those
groups,
who
can
reasonably
be
expected
to
have
a
serious
interest,
serious
enough
to
give
it
a
great
deal
of
thought.
and
may
i
add
one
more
item
before
the
time
is
up.
now,
this
is
--
we
are
not
dealing
here
with
a
question
of
state
or
federal
or
even
municipal
ballots,
franchise
and
representation
and
consequently,
when
the
chief
justice
in
reynolds
said
clearly
irrational
state
policy
insufficient
because
of
the
central
importance
of
general
elections,
i
emphasize
general.
this
is
not
applicable,
so
consequently,
the
only
test
we
do
not
need
that
the
far
sterner
test
of
justices
douglas
and
fortas
are
mentioned
in
their
dissent
in
cardona.
the
only
test
we
have
is
there
are
some
reasonable
relations
between
what
the
state
is
trying
to
do
and
what
the
statute
does
and
--
mr.
john
p.
jehu
i
would
indeed
sir.
mr.
john
p.
jehu
i
will
supply
the
court
with
copies
or
texts
of
the
relevant
sections
of
the
education
and
other
laws
dealing
with
various
questions
which
have
been
raised
during
the
argument.
mr.
john
p.
jehu
i
would
like
to
do
that
sometime
next
week.
mr.
john
p.
jehu
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
very
important
case
i
believe
and
it
also
i
believe
were
one
of
the
first
impressions.
it
involves
such
matters
as
the
relationship
between
the
state
and
the
federal
government
and
also
between
the
judiciary
and
legislative
branches.
now,
perhaps
in
answer
to
some
of
the
questions,
the
questions
i
asked
of
mr.
fraenkel,
i
should
say
this
that
boards
of
education
and
school
districts
in
the
state
of
new
york
are
autonomous
units.
the
statute
sets
for
instance
the
requirements
as
to
required
subjects
in
the
curriculum.
beyond
that,
the
local
board
of
education
can
determine
to
have
other
subject
in
their
choice
and
the
board
of
regents
under
commission
of
education
of
course
have
supervisory
powers.
the
commissioner
of
education
has
particularly
the
judicial
powers
over
the
school
system
where
regular
pleadings
and
oral
arguments
and
briefs
are
filed
and
so
forth
and
then
the
local,
the
statutes
in
new
york
says,
his
decisions
are
final
and
not
subject
to
review.
now,
the
courts
of
the
state
however
have
happily
reviewed
them
all
along.
but
in
any
event,
the
districts
are
very
autonomous.
there
is
over
800
school
districts
in
the
state
and
the
statute
here
2012
and
i
might
add
to
that
also
requires
three
general
qualifications
together
with
one
of
three
specials.
the
three
generals
are
residence,
citizenship
and
majority.
in
addition
to
that,
one
of
three
qualifications
have
to
bring
a
qualified
vote
to
be
qualified
into
the
community
of
interest
in
the
school
system
which
is
a
special
purpose
administrative
not
legislative
units
only
it
does
administer
to
schools.
under
the
jurisdiction,
general
jurisdiction
of
the
education
department
because
under
the
state
constitution
and
the
law
in
new
york,
education
is
a
state
function
as
it
is
under
the
tenth
amendment
is
a
state
function.
now,
to
go
into
the
problem
of
this
particular
case,
this
is
a
matter
as
i
said
under
the
tenth
amendment
of
state
concern
only.
there
is
nothing
in
the
united
states
constitution
or
in
any
act
of
congress
that
guarantees
to
anybody
in
this
country
the
right
to
vote
in
school
district
meetings
or
elections.
and
an
answer
incidentally
to
mr.
justice
stewart's
question
before,
the
voting
takes
place
either
at
meetings,
town
meeting
types
or
at
election
types
which
is
up
to
the
local
board
as
which
as
they
are
the
one
going
to
handle
it.
they
can
put
up
a
ballot
box
--
mr.
john
p.
jehu
well,
it
says
--
mr.
john
p.
jehu
it
may
well
be
so
your
honor.
i'm
not
sure
about
that.
we
have
always
read
about
that
in
meetings
or
elections
--
mr.
john
p.
jehu
the
statute
itself
i
think
is
set
forth
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
below.
it's
in
the
appendix
i
do
believe.
yes.
well,
in
any
event
your
honor
--
mr.
john
p.
jehu
page
2
of
the
appellant's
brief.
the
statute
is
quoted.
the
person
shall
be
entitled
to
vote
at
any
school
meeting
for
the
election
of
school
district
officer
who
might
also
in
other
matters
which
may
be
brought
before
such
meetings
then
it
goes
on
to
a
(inaudible).
we
have
it
in
here.
it's
on
page
4
of
the
appendix
your
honor.
it
says,
a
person
shall
be
entitled
to
vote
at
any
school
meeting
for
the
election
of
school
district
officers
and
that
all
other
matters
which
may
be
brought
before
such
meeting
and
so
forth.
but
other
section
of
the
education
law
parenthesis
2035
authorizes
them
to
use
voting
machines
if
that's
all
see
fit
and
if
they
can
rent
them
from
the
counter
village
of
county
and
they
often
times
do
especially
in
the
larger
districts
to
say
it
then.
mr.
john
p.
jehu
it
is
modified
for
other
sections
of
the
education
law,
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
john
p.
jehu
that's
correct
your
honor
and
in
the
so-called
--
mr.
john
p.
jehu
the
smaller
cities,
that's
correct
and
between
the
two
groups
of
city
school
districts
as
more
than
two-thirds
of
the
population
of
the
states,
some
11
million
people
by
the
1960
census.
so
that
this
is
a
fairly
limited
group
on
law,
there
are
number
of
districts
involved.
some
are
very
small.
some
of
these
geographical
units
are
very
tiny.
this
is
one
of
our
problems
to
try
to
get
them
together
but
this
is
not
the
problem
here.
now,
i'm
trying
to
say
is
this
--
mr.
john
p.
jehu
yes,
your
honor.
the
first
thing
that
--
they
will
have
to
have
an
annual
meeting.
this
is
a
requirement
of
law.
every
one
of
these
districts
involved
here
has
to
have
an
annual
meeting.
this
takes
place
either
on
may
or
in
june
or
july
by
local
action.
first
thing
they'll
do
is
they
elect
a
board
of
education
or
there's
a
member
each
year
or
two
members
or
whatever
the
rotation
happens
to
be.
secondly,
they
must
adopt
a
budget
for
the
operating
expenses
of
the
district
for
the
ensuing
year.
in
addition
to
that,
they
can
have
any
number
of
other
resolutions
such
as
purchase
of
a
school
bus
or
the
building
of
some
extra
classrooms
as
they
may
be
required
or
the
putting
up
of
a
brand
new
building.
they're
all
matters
of
the
administration
of
the
school
system,
of
the
local
school
system
for
the
students
that
are
residing
in
the
district
and
to
take
care
of
their
particular
problems.
now,
the
board
of
education
which
is
elected
there
has
certain
powers
and
the
powers
of
the
board
of
education
are
set
forth
in
1709
of
the
education
law
the
powers
of
the
voters
on
2021
basically
but
there's
various
provisions
all
over
the
education
law
some
2000
sections
altogether
and
it's
a
very
complicated
statute
which
right
now,
we
have
joint
legislative
committee
to
try
and
revise
and
simplify
but
--
does
that
answer
your
question,
your
honor?
mr.
john
p.
jehu
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
p.
jehu
well,
section
2021
your
honor
consists
of
some
20
or
30
subdivisions
which
indicate
the
powers
of
the
voters.
first,
they
have
the
power
to
regulate
the
affairs
of
the
meeting
itself.
they
have
a
power
to
vote
taxes
for
various
things.
there's
another
section
416
of
the
education
law
which
says
that
the
voters
have
a
power
to
levy
taxes,
for
teacher
salaries,
for
the
building
of
school
buildings,
for
the
buying
of
school
buses,
for
the
buying
of
school
property,
for
playing
fields
and
whatever
the
multi-various
purposes
of
a
school
system
are.
they
have
to
hire
janitors
which
is
done
by
the
board
of
education
but
the
money
therefore
is
a
appropriated
by
the
voters.
and
to
some
extent,
teachers'
salaries
and
the
group
of
items
known
as
ordinary
contention
expenses
which
is
light,
heat,
water,
telephone,
that
sort
of
thing,
the
board
of
education
has
the
power
to
do
that
without
reference
to
the
voters
and
if
the
voters
vote
it
down,
the
board
still
does
it
because
it
has
to
--
the
schools
have
to
be
kept
running.
now,
this
is
a
constitutional
requirement
under
section
1
of
article
11
of
the
state
constitution
but
in
other
words,
all
these
voters
do
really,
this
is
the
gist
of
it.
there
are
many,
many
details
is
that
they
must
prepare,
authorize
appropriate
money
so
that
the
schools
can
be
kept
running.
there's
any
number
of
things
now
of
course
with
machine
being
used
for
various
data
processing
and
all
kinds
of
things
whatever
it
takes
to
run
the
schools
and
that's
all.
they
have
no
power
beyond
that.
mr.
john
p.
jehu
that's
correct,
your
honor.
it's
the
real
property
taxes
--
mr.
john
p.
jehu
excuse
me
sir?
mr.
john
p.
jehu
well,
the
tax
provisions
were
taken
out
of
the
state
education
law
many
years
ago
and
put
into
the
real
property
tax
law
and
they
would
be
in
article
13
of
the
real
property
tax
law
has
all
the
different
provisions
but
all
they
have
is
a
power
to
levy
a
tax
on
real
property.
certain
city
school
districts
have
the
right
to
levy
a
utility
tax
of
up
3%.
mr.
john
p.
jehu
in
the
education
law,
your
honor?
mr.
john
p.
jehu
well,
as
i
indicate
your
honor,
this
is
no
longer
in
the
education
law.
it's
in
the
real
property
tax
law
which
is
a
different
volume
of
the
consolidated
law.
mr.
john
p.
jehu
well,
the
powers
of
the
meeting
basically
--
mr.
john
p.
jehu
are
to
--
mr.
john
p.
jehu
yes.
mr.
john
p.
jehu
right.
well,
the
power
to
tax
is
limited
in
answer
to
your
honor's
question
absolutely
and
definitely
to
the
real
property
taxes.
now,
but
that
is
not
in
the
education
law
but
it's
in
another
statute
that
the
matter
was
transferred
to
starting
in
section
13
under
the
real
property
tax
law.
i
don't
know
--
the
moment
they
remember
which
one
of
the
three
or
four
sections
following
1300
of
these.
mr.
john
p.
jehu
the
operations
of
the
school
districts
of
the
state
are
financed
basically
from
the
school
tax
which
is
a
real
property
tax.
in
addition
to
that,
they
get
a
great
amount
of
state
aid,
and
that
state
aid
and
this
will
be
part
of
my
argument
about
some
of
the
claims
made
here,
that
state
aid
is
derived
from
a
number
of
sources,
the
state
income
tax,
various
cooperation
taxes
and
as
a
whole
flock
of
sources
that
budget
is
made
up.
mr.
john
p.
jehu
there
are
--
mr.
john
p.
jehu
we
have
a
state
sales
tax
now,
that's
correct
which
is
also
is
part
of
that
and
they
have
local
sales
tax
just
like
in
new
york
city
and
some
of
the
counties
have
sales
taxes.
mr.
john
p.
jehu
but
all
these
things
go
into
the
state
budget
and
before
that
budget
is
made
up,
a
new
formula
is
made
up,
state
aid
formula
is
made
up
almost
every
year,
and
that
formula
determines
how
much
the
taxes
will
have
to
be
brought
into
the
state
conference
in
order
to
cover
the
various
expenses
including
education.
mr.
john
p.
jehu
oh!
indeed
they
do,
your
honor
but
that
is
the
main
part
--
mr.
john
p.
jehu
and
the
main
part
if
it
please
chief
justice,
my
argument
is
this
--
mr.
john
p.
jehu
no,
on
this
point
is
what
i
mean.
mr.
john
p.
jehu
that's
absolutely
correct
and
some
of
their
federal
taxes
go
into
that
picture
but
what
i'm
getting
at
is
that
he
has
never
lost
and
does
not
now
lose
his
franchise
on
state
legislation
which
determines
how
much
of
his
tax
money
goes
into
the
education
system
and
he
has
not
lost
his
franchise
to
elect
a
senator
of
the
united
states
or
congressman
who
would
in
turn
determine
how
much
federal
money
goes
back
to
the
states
for
schools.
this
he
can
vote
and
this
i
think
is
a
vital
distinction
of
this
case
from
some
other
cases
the
court
has
recently
decided.
mr.
john
p.
jehu
no.
mr.
john
p.
jehu
as
i
say
the
--
mr.
john
p.
jehu
this
--
the
whole
state
aide
formula
is
the
most
complicated
kind
of
a
machinery
and
what
the
voters
do,
they
merely
authorize
that
district
to
spend,
shall
we
say,
$5
million
for
their
schools.
mr.
john
p.
jehu
and
that
that
authorization
to
spend
then
has
to
be
covered
by
an
estimate
of
how
much
state
aid
will
they
get,
how
much
federal
aid
will
they
get,
how
much
will
they
get
from
other
various
source
of
income
such
tuition
and
so
forth.
and
then
they
deduct
that
and
the
difference,
the
board
of
education
levies
some
taxes
on
the
real
property
in
the
district.
mr.
john
p.
jehu
well,
the
vote
your
honor
is
not
on
the
total
amount.
the
vote
is
on
the
authorization
of
specific
items
for
certain
purposes.
mr.
john
p.
jehu
oh!
there's
no
question
your
honor
that
this
whole
system
has
caused
difficulties
in
the
state.
mr.
john
p.
jehu
i
don't
think
your
honor.
i
don't
think
that's
all
because
he
has
to
pay
the
state
on
federal
taxes
regardless
of
whether
it
will
spend
on
this
district
or
whether
it
will
go
to
oklahoma
or
california.
if
that
district
doesn't
spend
it,
somebody
will
and
the
total
amount
is
the
same
either
way.
mr.
john
p.
jehu
well,
may
i
explain
--
mr.
john
p.
jehu
may
i
explain
this.
mr.
john
p.
jehu
this
may
well
be
one
of
the
reasons.
mr.
john
p.
jehu
because
he
is
not
a
member
of
the
community
of
interest.
mr.
john
p.
jehu
no.
may
i
state
that
--
mr.
john
p.
jehu
no,
that
would
be
an
invidious
discrimination.
mr.
john
p.
jehu
because
there
is
no
relation
between
the
purpose
of
the
statutory
objective
of
the
legislature
and
the
way
they're
doing
it.
in
other
words,
the
democrat
is
--
mr.
john
p.
jehu
well,
he's
not
being
excluded
because
he's
a
bachelor
he
is
excluded
because
he
has
absolutely
no
--
mr.
john
p.
jehu
no,
he
is
excluded
because
he
has
absolutely
no
interest
in
the
operations
of
the
school
system.
mr.
john
p.
jehu
his
children
are
not
affected
because
he
has
no
children,
whatever
--
mr.
john
p.
jehu
just
a
moment,
if
i
may
your
honor.
the
first
part
is
the
fact
he
has
no
children.
in
other
words,
whether
he
votes
for
or
against
something,
if
he
could
it
wouldn't
affect
him
since
he
has
none.
now,
the
other
thing
is,
it
doesn't
cost
him
a
penny
from
the
real
property
tax
which
is
the
only
thing
--
the
direct
taxation
that
he
can
vote
on.
he
can
vote
on
how
much
the
district
gets
or
how
much
federal
aid.
that
is
taken
care
of
by
his
use
of
the
ballot,
by
electing
state
and
federal
legislators
who
will
determine
that
for
him.
there,
he
has
a
full
ballot.
mr.
john
p.
jehu
he
could
vote,
absolutely.
mr.
john
p.
jehu
well,
they
--
mr.
john
p.
jehu
right.
mr.
john
p.
jehu
well,
the
question
really
your
honor
is
this.
in
the
first
place,
do
we
have
to
meet
a
test
such
as
we
had
in
the
cardona
case?
now,
in
cardona,
we
have
this
mrs.
cardona
who
was
disfranchised
by
the
statute
and
she
could
not
in
any
way
do
anything
about
it
because
being
disfranchised
you
have
no
access
to
the
franchise
to
change
that
statute.
here
on
the
other
hand,
we
have
a
person
who
is
not
disfranchised
on
state
legislation.
if
he
wants
to
change
that
2012,
he
can
go
and
vote
for
people
who
will
go
and
change
it.
and
i
might
say
in
this
connection,
while
this
lawsuit
was
going
on,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
some
of
the
things
that
were
criticized
below
have
been
amended.
the
spouse
of
the
tenant
which
judge
weinstein
said
should
not
be
excluded
and
i
think
judge
hayes
have
long
since
been
put
in
by
the
legislature
and
that
the
statement
was
made,
there
are
so
few
of
these
people
that
the
legislative
processes
will
not
be
adequate.
and
at
the
same
time,
it
was
done
and
we
have,
as
i
point
out
on
our
supplemental
brief
there
is
now
a
constitutional
amendment
again
before
the
state
legislature
to
eliminate
all
these
special
things
but
the
purpose
of
it
and
this
is
to
answer
your
question
mr.
justice
marshall.
in
order
for
the
legislature
to
make
sure
that
this
extremely
important
business
of
elementary
and
secondary
education
is
properly
determined
under
local
basis
where
it
has
to
be
determined
under
state
law.
he
must
make
sure
that
those
people
who
get
the
franchise
on
that
are
those
people
who
can
reasonably
be
expected
to
be
interested
enough
in
it,
to
spend
the
considerable
amount
of
time
necessary
to
really
inform
yourself
on
these
very
complicated
questions.
mr.
john
p.
jehu
may
i
make
two
answers
to
that
your
honor.
one
is
the
mere
fact
that
he's
interested
and
knowledgeable
for
all
know,
he
may
have
written
all
the
books
in
education
but
the
legislature
cannot
anticipate
when
they
make
this
rule
that
those
persons
who
are
not
in
the
category,
that
were
the
two
categories
we're
talking
about,
will
have
naturally
and
foreseeably
the
kind
of
interest
which
will
guarantee
a
reasonable
decision
on
school
matters.
mr.
john
p.
jehu
i
would
say
your
honor
that
they're
properly
excluded
here
because
the
parents
themselves
is
the
--
if
they
have
the
children,
the
people
you're
talking
about
whose
grandchildren
do
have
the
franchise
but
the
interest
of
these
other
people
is
purely
theoretical
just
like
i
have
a
tremendous
interest
in
good
education
in
mississippi
right
now.
mr.
john
p.
jehu
unless
he
is
assessed
for
a
school
tax.
if
he
rents
a
garage
for
instance
or
if
he
owns
a
home
then
obviously
he
has
the
kind
of
interest
that
the
legislature
reasonably
can
be
expected
to
base
a
decision
on
as
to
who
should
vote
and
who
should
not.
mr.
john
p.
jehu
your
honor,
isn't
it
the
question
of
payment
of
taxes.
all
he
has
to
be
is
assessed.
now,
if
he
for
instance
refused
to
pay
taxes,
being
assessed,
he
may
not
lose
his
property
for
two
years.
he
still
votes
all
this
time.
mr.
john
p.
jehu
if
that
did
that
your
honor
we
will
run
into
harbor
and
properly
so
that
would
be
impermissible
because
wealth
as
you
had
pointed
out
in
harbor
has
no
relation
to
the
use
of
the
franchise.
this
is
put
in
merely
to
make
sure
that
we
have
those
people,
those
groups,
who
can
reasonably
be
expected
to
have
a
serious
interest,
serious
enough
to
give
it
a
great
deal
of
thought.
and
may
i
add
one
more
item
before
the
time
is
up.
now,
this
is
--
we
are
not
dealing
here
with
a
question
of
state
or
federal
or
even
municipal
ballots,
franchise
and
representation
and
consequently,
when
the
chief
justice
in
reynolds
said
clearly
irrational
state
policy
insufficient
because
of
the
central
importance
of
general
elections,
i
emphasize
general.
this
is
not
applicable,
so
consequently,
the
only
test
we
do
not
need
that
the
far
sterner
test
of
justices
douglas
and
fortas
are
mentioned
in
their
dissent
in
cardona.
the
only
test
we
have
is
there
are
some
reasonable
relations
between
what
the
state
is
trying
to
do
and
what
the
statute
does
and
--
mr.
john
p.
jehu
i
would
indeed
sir.
mr.
john
p.
jehu
i
will
supply
the
court
with
copies
or
texts
of
the
relevant
sections
of
the
education
and
other
laws
dealing
with
various
questions
which
have
been
raised
during
the
argument.
mr.
john
p.
jehu
i
would
like
to
do
that
sometime
next
week.
