mr.
mccarthy,
do
you
split
any
responsibility
on
retained
counsel?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
is
your
position
that
the
fact
that
they
didn't
call
the
alcoholic
anonymous
man
was
enough?
justice
thurgood
marshall
or
what
should
the
court
do,
go
out
and
subpoena
witnesses?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
don't
you
think
the
judge
is
right
in
taking
consideration
that
this
man
might
have
been
fit
alcoholics
anonymous
but
that
wasn't
sufficient?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
else
did
the
court
have
other
the
lawyer
statement
that
this
mans
was
a
fit
subject
of
alcoholics
anonymous?
what
else
did
the
judge
have?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
discretionary,
isn't
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
why
he
put
a
65-year-old
man
in
jail?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
discretionary.
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
your
argument
be
the
same
if
he
was
45?
justice
thurgood
marshall
where
would
you
draw
the
line?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
should
the
judge
do
at
that
stage?
put
him
on
the
stand?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
indeed
it's
original
hearing?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
should
the
court
have
done
then?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
suppose
he
had
done
that,
would
it
be
alright?
that
would
be
enough?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
military
calls?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes,
i
know.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i'm
still
wondering.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
couldn't
the
defendant
with
or
without
the
advice
of
a
retained
counsel
have
volunteered
what
was
good
for
him?
justice
thurgood
marshall
or
do
you
think
the
court
is
obliged
to
inquire
into
all
of
the
materials?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
come
back
to
my
original

we're
taking
