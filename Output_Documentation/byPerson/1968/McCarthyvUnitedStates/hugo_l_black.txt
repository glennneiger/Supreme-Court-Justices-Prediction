20
and
21
and
22
correctly
set
out
the
conversation
that
took
place
between
the
judge
and
the
prisoner?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
what
happened?
did
i
understand
you
to
say
a
while
ago
that
the
judge
did
not
directly
address
the
defendant?
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
say
what?
did
i
understand
you
to
say
he
did
not
directly
address
the
defendant?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
they
had
the
conversation
which
was
shown?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
misunderstood
you.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
he
asked
him
about
several
things
that
he
understood,
didn't
he?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
was
he
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
exactly
how
did
he
ask
that
under
the
rule?
in
your
judgment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
it
would
not
be
enough?
in
your
judgment,
did
he
fail
to
ask?
he
should
have
asked.
justice
hugo
l.
black
because
of
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
it
you
say
that
had
didn't
ask
that
the
rule
requires
him
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
the
rule
say
that
he
should
ask
him
if
he
willfully
did
it?
committed
a
crime?
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
he
did
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
and
determined?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
he
did
that
which
is
voluntarily,
didn't
he?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
he
asked
about
three
or
four
understanding
but
he
didn't
sweep
in
the
whole
thing
he
says.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
may
be
right,
i'm
just
asking.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
joining
issue
with
you
rather
i'd
see
just
exactly
what
was?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
about
his
business?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
say
they
could
raise
this
collaterally
in
one
or
two
ways.
what's
the
use
of
presenting
it
to
us?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
why
should
you
contest
to
it
if
you
say
it
can
be
raised
collaterally?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
told
me
you
decide
against
it?
i
understood
you
to
say
he
could
raise
it
collaterally.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
then
what
you
want
is
just
to
show
what
happen
or
why
go
over
all
that
fight
just
accept
a
retain
a
plea
of
guilty?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
go
over
all
that
fight
just
to
retain
a
plea
of
guilty
when
you
could
just
try
him
again?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right,
not
his
will
but
what
if
it's
shown
that
there
are
mistakes.
the
judge
left
something
else.
why
shouldn't
he
just
have
it
tried
to
try
though
he'd
never
made
this
false
step
on
the
plea
of
guilty?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
courts
have
been
very
liberal
and
haven't
been
admonished
to
be
liberal
in
connection
with
letting
people
withdraw
their
pleas
of
guilty.
when
they
have
pleaded
guilty
and
they
cannot
then
make
a
--
what
seems
to
be
bona
fide
claim
and
it
was
not
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
of
course
the
government
wouldn't
want
to
keep
a
conviction
and
demand
rarely
had
not
violated
along
way?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
a
collateral
proceeding
or
just
a
remand
for
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
understand
that
you
concede
that
they
raised
the
question
in
connection
with
the
judge
which
if
it
was
correct
he
wouldn't
have
been
justified
for
pleading
guilty.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
that
his
lawyer
was
raising
it
and
saying
that
he
had
been
drinking
and
that
he
didn't
know.
was
that
right?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what
did
he
say
about
it?
what
did
he
say
about
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
about
the
defendant's
knowledge.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
did
he
say
from
which
something
could
be
inferred
about
his
drinking?
justice
hugo
l.
black
just
that
part
of
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
it
in
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
believe
the
impression
with
the
judge?
that
the
man
had
been
drinking
to
such
extent
that
he
could
not
have
willfully
committed
a
crime?
justice
hugo
l.
black
mr.
mccarthy

justice
hugo
l.
black
i
noticed
on
the
last
sentence
of
your
brief,
you
asked
that
the
case
be
reversed
and
of
course
remand
it,
but
further
proceedings
can
(inaudible)
alone.
what
proceedings?
justice

what?
