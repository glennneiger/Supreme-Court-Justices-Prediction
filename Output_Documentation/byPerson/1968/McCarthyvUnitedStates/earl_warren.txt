mr.

chief

warren
mr.
springer.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
what
he
was
convicted
of?
chief
justice
earl
warren
$15,000.00
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh!
i
thought
he
pled
guilty
to
one
of
the
three
counts?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
the
other
two
are
dismissed?
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
it
had
not
been
willful,
if
it
had
been
neglected,
it
would
have
been
an
included
offense,
would
it
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
a
defendant
had
misunderstood
that
word
willful
and
it
had
been
a
matter
of
neglect
as
far
as
he
was
concerned
it
would
have
been
a
minor
offense,
wouldn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
whether
any
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
let's
put
it
this
was,
were
there
any
included
offenses?
are
there
any
included
offenses
in
a
charge
of
this
kind?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
the
district
attorney
does
have
a
right
to
charge
it
either
as
a
misdemeanor
or
as
a
felony
is
he
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
understand
you
to
say
that
there's
enough
in
the
record
to
support
an
inference
by
us
that
the
court
did
satisfy
this
rule.
does
that,
do
you
go
farther
and
do
you
say
that
there
was
a
clear
compliance
with
rule
11
by
the
judge?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
it
isn't
semantic
at
all.
it's
one
thing
to
say
that
there's
enough
in
the
record
for
us
to
infer
that
perhaps
he
did
know
enough
about
the
case
and
properly
sentence
him
and
it's
another
thing
to
answer
whether
he
actually
followed
rule
11
or
not
which
is
the
question
before
us.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
he
did
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
think
it
is
too
much
for
this
court
to
insist
that
rule
11
be
followed
by
district
judge
before
he
sends
a
man
away
the
prison
for
a
term
of
years
when
the
defendant
has
plead
guilty
is
safe
to
state
the
trial.
he's
before
him.
therefore
anything
the
judge
wants
to
do
up
to
the
maximum
of
punishment
that
the
statute
allowed.
do
you
think
it's
too
much
for
a
judge
to
clearly
and
distinctly
and
accurately
follow
rule
11?
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
why
do
you
support
this?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
we
ought
to
give
a
benefit
to
the
--
of
doubt
to
the
judge
rather
than
to
the
defendant?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
effect,
you
qualify
everything
you
say.
you
say
in
effect
and
you
answered
me
a
moment
ago
that
he
did
not
follow
the
rule.
chief
justice
earl
warren
his
counsel
told
the
court,
this
man
because
of
his
drinking
was
negligent
in
doing
these
things
and
it
was
negligence
that
brought
this
around
rather
than
deliberation
and
that
did
not
prompt
the
court
to
go
any
farther
at
all.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
get
back
to
inferences
again.
he
said
that
to
the
court.
it
isn't
an
inference.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
i
think
we
are
getting
into
semantics
when
you
refer
it
that
way
and
his
violation
but
reading
it,
the
effect
of
it
is
that
it
didn't
injure
the
defendant
at
all.
that
is
semantics.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
didn't
counsel
say
specifically
to
the
court
that
the
(inaudible)
report
this
was
a
matter
of
negligence
on
the
part
of
the
defendant
and
not
intentional
but
he
realized
that
if
some
circumstances,
negligence
could
be
equated
to
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
neglect,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
instead
of
negligent
consent?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
mean
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
counsel,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
tell
you
frankly
what
concerns
me
in
this
case.
here,
we
have
rule
11
that
is
designed
by
this
court
and
by
the
congress
to
eliminate
the
possibility
of
an
innocent
man
pleading
guilty
and
being
sentence
to
the
penitentiary
because
he
does
know
what
he
is
pleading
guilty
to.
and
you
say
to
us
that
remedial
statute
has
not
been
followed
by
the
court
in
this
case.
yet
you
asked
us
by
reason
of
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
to
excuse
the
judge
from
having
done
this
simple
act
and
ask
us
to
keep
the
man
in
the
penitentiary
where
a
trial
of
this
simple
case
could
have
cleared
the
matter
up
entirely.
now,
if
are
we
going
to
be
subjective
to
that
kind
of
cases
coming
in
here?
time
after
time
and
this
be
a
president
for
saying
well
the
judge
doesn't
have
to
follow
section
11
in
its
entirety
if
we
can
judge
them
a
totality
of
the
facts
that
the
defendant
probably
knew
what
he
was
doing
then
the
defendant
must
stay
in
the
penitentiary.
now,
really
this
case
to
me
has
more
significance
than
justice,
than
just
this
defendant.
there's
a
question
of
whether
we're
going
to
have
to
say
to
the
district
judges
that
they
need
not
follow
specifically
rule
11
which
is
of
no
great
burden
to
them
but
which
is
a
great
burden
to
a
defendant
when
it
comes
to
determining
the
number
of
years
he
is
going
to
spend
in
the
penitentiary.
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
a
presentence
report
available
to
the
defendant
in
this
counsel?
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
this
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
do
we
know
what
the
judge
said
that
he
actually
got
that
even
from
a
presentence
report
which
is
not
available
to
the
defendant?
might
he
got
it
from
discussing
that
with
the
district
attorney
or
with
somebody
else?
chief
justice
earl
warren
certainly
doesn't
show
that
he
got
it
from
any
illegal
way,
does
it?
what
he
said?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
is
there
in
this
record
to
support
the
statement
that
the
judge
is
satisfied
with
the
fact
that
he
didn't
properly
keep
his
books
but
kept
them
intentionally
wrong?
what
is
their
in
the
record
that
we
can
review
to
support
that
conviction
on
the
part
of
the
judge?
chief
justice
earl
warren
there
is
nothing,
isn't
that
correct?
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright.
mr.
mccarthy.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
you
do
not
ask
for
anything
more
than
to
give
the
man
the
trial?
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
mccarthy.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.

chief

earl
warren
is
that
what
he
was

of?
chief
justice
earl
warren
$15,000.00
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh!
i
thought
he
pled
guilty
to
one
of
the
three
counts?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
the
other
two
are
dismissed?
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
it
had
not
been
willful,
if
it
had
been

it
would
have
been
an

would
it
not?

--
let's
put

are
there
any

in

therefore
anything

chief

then
