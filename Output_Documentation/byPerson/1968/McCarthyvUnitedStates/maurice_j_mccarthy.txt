mr.
maurice
j.
mccarthy
may
it
please
the
court.
maurice
j.
mccarthy
appearing
on
behalf
of
the
petitioner,
william
j.
mccarthy.
i'm
sure
that
the
question
has
occurred
to
the
court
as
well,
cleared
up
initially
the
petitioner
and
i
are
not
related,
the
fact
that
we
have
the
same
last
name
is
purely
coincidence.
the
facts
in
this
case
are
not
complicated.
on
april
1,
1966,
a
three-count
indictment
was
returned
against
the
petitioner
charging
income
tax
evasion
under
section
7201
of
the
internal
revenue
code
and
alleging
that
there
were
deficiencies
and
taxes
of
approximately
$900.00
for
the
year
1959,
$5,000.00
for
the
year
1960,
and
$1,200.00
for
the
year
1961.
on
april
14,
1966,
the
petitioner
appeared
in
the
district
court
with
retained
counsel
and
at
that
time
counsel
waived
the
reading
of
the
indictment
and
entered
a
plea
of
not
guilty
to
each
of
the
three
counts.
the
court
set
the
trial
for
the
13th
of
june
1966,
thereafter,
which
the
record
does
not
disclose
the
trial
was
reset
for
june
30,
1966.
on
june
29,
1966,
government
counsel
appearing
ex
parte
informed
the
court
that
the
petitioner's
illness
made
it
impossible
to
try
the
case
and
asked
for
a
continuance.
the
district
judge
reset
the
case
to
the
15th
of
july.
on
the
15th
of
july
the
petitioner,
again
occurring
with
retained
counsel
appeared
for
the
trial
of
the
case
at
that
time
counsel
for
the
petitioner
informed
the
court
that
he
would
like
to
withdraw
the
plea
of
not
guilty
to
count
2
of
the
indictment
and
to
offer
a
plea
of
guilty
to
that
count
which
was
the
allegation
of
approximately
$500.00
in
unpaid
taxes
for
the
year
1960.
the
court
interrogated
counsel
for
the
government
who
indicated
that
upon
the
plea
of
guilty,
the
acceptance
of
the
plea
of
guilty
rather,
the
government
counsel
would
move
to
dismiss
counts
1
and
3.
the
circuit
--
the
district
judge
at
that
time
questioned
the
defendant
personally
as
to
two
matters.
first
of
all,
he
asked
the
defendant
in
the
trial
level,
if
he
was
aware
that
by
pleading
guilty,
he
waived
his
right
to
a
jury
trial
the
defendant
responded
in
the
affirmative.
he
then
asked
concerning
the
statutory
penalties
of
five
years
imprisonment
and
a
maximum
five-year
imprisonment
and
a
maximum
$10,000
fine.
upon
receiving
affirmative
responses,
the
district
judge
entered
a
finding
of
guilty.
at
this
point,
the
government
counsel
asked
the
district
judge
to
inquire
of
the
defendant
whether
any
threats
or
premises
had
been
made.
the
district
judge
did
inquire
and
received
negative
responses
that
no
threats
had
been
made
and
no
promises
had
been
given.
no
further
questioning
was
had
either
of
the
defendant
or
of
retained
counsel
and
the
case
was
set
for
a
sentencing
hearing
in
september
1966
on
september
14.
at
that
time,
the
petitioner
again
appeared
with
retained
counsel
and
the
district
judge
in
the
elocution
procedure
as
the
defendant
personally
if
he
had
anything
to
say.
the
defendant
response
was
that
if
it
were
not
for
his
health
and
the
things
that
he
had
gone
through,
that
had
never
would
have
happen
and
that
it
was
not
deliberate.
no
further
questions
were
asked
of
the
defendant.
the
petitioner's
counsel
at
that
time
was
present
and
the
district
court
directed
its
attention
to
him.
he
was
asked
if
he
had
a
statement
and
he
made
a
brief
statement.
the
court
then
indicated
that
in
view
of
the
size
of
the
amount
involved
that
the
debtor
in
effect
of
the
sentence
was
necessary
and
entered
a
sentence
of
one
year
imprisonment
and
a
fine
of
a
$2,500.00.
counsel
for
the
petitioner
on
the
district
court
level
then
asked
to
be
heard.
he
addressed
the
district
judge
and
informed
the
district
judge
of
the
facts
concerning
the
character
of
the
defendant
himself.
he
indicated
to
the
court
that
the
defendant
was
at
that
time
of
the
proceedings,
65
years
old
that
he
had
never
been
familiar
with
any
federal
offense
of
any
sort
that
he
had
a
fine
family.
he
further
informed
the
court
that
the
defendant
had
just
recently
approximately
two
months
prior
to
the
sentencing
hearing
which
was
at
approximately
the
same
time
as
the
tender
of
the
plea
of
guilty
that
the
petitioner
had
become
a
member
of
alcoholics
anonymous
because
he
had
been
an
acute
alcoholic
for
some
time.
he
further
informed
the
court
that
at
the
time
that
the
crime
was
allegedly
committed,
that
being
the
time
of
the
filing
of
the
income
tax
return
that
the
petitioner
had
been
involved
in
what
counsel
called
a
protracted
drinking
situation
from
which
he
was
hospitalized.
no
questions
concerning
this
matter
were
asked
of
the
counsel
for
the
defendant
in
the
district
court.
counsel
then
spoke
of
the
nature
of
the
crime
and
of
the
evidence
that
was
present
or
inherently
present
on
the
district
court
level.
his
exposition
of
the
crime
consisted
in
saying
that
the
books
of
the
defendant
had
been
negligently
kept
and
that
this
negligence
amounted
to
one,
it
became
gross
amounted
to
criminal
intent.
the
--
there
was
not
questioning
concerning
the
exposition
of
the
crime.
the
probation
officer
then
informed
the
court
that
the
alcoholic
anonymous
sponsor
of
the
defendant
was
present
in
open
court
and
available
to
testify
concerning
those
matters.
the
district
court
did
no
take
any
testimony
or
confer
with
the
sponsor
from
alcoholics
anonymous.
the
district
court
then
refused
to
vacate
or
suspend
sentence
and
entered
a
state
of
execution
for
approximately
15
days.
the
argument
of
the
petitioner
presents
three
questions.
first
of
these
questions
concerns
federal
rule
11
of
the
rules
of
criminal
procedure
which
was
amended
effective
july
1,
1966
since
this
plea
was
tendered
on
july
15,
1966,
it
is
governed
by
the
rule
as
amended.
that
amendment
and
the
notes
of
the
advisory
committee
to
this
court
concerning
the
addition
of
the
ordering
in
the
rule
which
constitute
the
amendment
is
critical
in
this
case.
the
amendment
required
that
the
district
court
addressed
the
defendant
personally
rather
than
what
had
been
practiced
in
the
past
of
allowing
the
court
to
addressed
counsel
for
the
defendant.
in
this
case,
there
was
no
questioning
of
the
petitioner
other
than
on
the
merits
which
i
have
stated
and
in
the
exposition
of
facts.
our
contention
is
that
amended
rule
11
directs
and
demands
that
the
district
judge
inquire
personally
of
the
defendant
as
to
his
understanding
of
the
nature
of
the
charge.
this
was
never
done.
we
therefore
contend
that
at
the
time
of
the
acceptance
of
the
plea
of
guilty
on
july
15,
1966,
error
was
committed.
we
contend
that
this
error
was
compounded
at
the
sentencing
hearing
which
occurred
in
september
1966
in
that
certain
facts
were
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
district
court
which
required
inquiry.
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
to
this
court
the
universal
opinion
of
the
lower
courts,
the
circuit
courts
that
rule
11
imposes
on
the
district
judge
a
duty
of
inquiry.
we
feel
that
in
view
of
the
facts
presented
to
the
district
judge,
this
duty
of
inquiry
was
very
right
and
yet
no
inquiry
was
had
of
the
defendant
personally
or
even
of
his
counsel
for
that
matter
or
the
other
persons
who
were
available
to
give
information.
mr.
maurice
j.
mccarthy
the
--
there
is
no
provision
in
rule
11
concerning
a
duty
of
inquiry
but
the
provision
in
rule
11
is
that
the
district
judge
must
address
the
defendant
personally
and
determine.
i
draw
from
this
the
conclusion.
mr.
maurice
j.
mccarthy
voluntarily
with
understanding
of
the
nature
of
the
charge
and
the
consequences
of
the
plea.
i
draw
from
this
the
conclusion
and
i
support
it
with
case
law
in
briefs
that
there
is
a
duty
of
inquiry
on
the
district
judge
both
at
the
time
that
the
plea
is
accepted
and
later
when
sentence
is
rendered
against
the
defendant
to
inquire
in
the
event
that
any
fact
is
presented
to
the
judge
concerning
the
nature
of
the
crime
or
the
character
of
the
defendant.
in
this
case,
there
was
no
questioning
whatever.
not
one
question
of
the
petitioner
himself
as
to
what
he
understood
to
be
the
nature
of
the
accusation
nor
of
the
petitioner's
counsel.
both
of
these
persons
were
present
and
available
to
testify
and
much
of
the
confusion
in
the
record
could
have
been
cleared
of
had
the
district
judge
address
questions
to
them.
mr.
maurice
j.
mccarthy
judgment
was
entered
on
september
14,
1966.
mr.
maurice
j.
mccarthy
yes,
he
did
your
honor
but
this
i
--
mr.
maurice
j.
mccarthy
yes,
he
did.
mr.
maurice
j.
mccarthy
no,
there
was
no
finding.
mr.
maurice
j.
mccarthy
i
don't
argue
that
there
must
be
an
explicit
finding.
mr.
maurice
j.
mccarthy
the
rule,
the
wording
of
the
rule
itself
does
not
require
an
explicit
finding.
it
says
that
the
judge
--
mr.
maurice
j.
mccarthy
well,
the
one
thing
i
see
in
there
is
explicit,
is
that
the
judge
must
make
a
determination.
that
the
plea
is
made
voluntarily
with
understanding
of
the
nature
of
the
charge
and
the
consequences
of
the
plea.
mr.
maurice
j.
mccarthy
the
latter
part
of
the
rule,
i
read
to
require
the
judge
to
be
satisfied
in
the
circumstances
that
a
factual
basis
exists
for
the
plea.
now,
it
does
not
say
for
the
charge.
it
does
not
say
that
the
acts
which
constitute
the
charge
that
he
is
satisfied
that
those
acts
occurred.
mr.
maurice
j.
mccarthy
well,
i
think
that
this
is
the
argument
which
we
have
made
your
honor
and
our
brief
is
that
there
are
two
elements
to
the
crime.
since
this
is
a
specific
intent
crime,
there
are
the
acts
and
there
is
the
intent.
mr.
maurice
j.
mccarthy
perhaps
not
as
artistically
as
i
should
have
but
this
is
--
mr.
maurice
j.
mccarthy
as
far
as
i
understand
that
that's
correct.
mr.
maurice
j.
mccarthy
no,
i
don't
think
it
would
your
honor.
i
think
there
must
be.
mr.
maurice
j.
mccarthy
my
argument
is
this.
that
error
occurred
at
the
time
of
acceptance
of
the
plea.
had
that
error
not
occurred,
there
would
have
been
no
presentence
report.
and
i
therefore
do
not
consider
the
presentence
report
as
controlling
in
any
way.
i
feel
thereafter
that
the
matters
occurring
in
open
court
and
the
information
supplied
to
the
district
judge
in
open
court
served
to
compound
the
error
by
indicating
to
the
district
judge
that
there
was
no
factual
basis
for
the
plea.
mr.
maurice
j.
mccarthy
well,
i
have
--
mr.
maurice
j.
mccarthy
i
have
not
argued
with
that
last
part
of
the
rule
is
mandatory
because
of
the
language
of
the
rule
itself.
it
says
the
district
court
must
be
satisfied.
this
is
a
word
which
leaves
some
room
for
argument.
my
position
and
the
position
of
the
petitioner
is
that
in
view
of
the
matters
occurring
in
open
court,
any
decision
which
the
district
court
came
to
was
not
founded
upon
a
reasonable
basis
that
the
court
was
informed
of
matters
which
required
further
inquiry,
was
informed
of
the
age
and
inexperience
with
criminal
matters
of
the
defendant
was
informed
of
his
past
alcoholic
condition
both
at
the
time
of
the
plea
was
tendered
and
at
the
time
that
crime
was
alleged
to
have
been
committed
and
was
informed
that
counsel
for
the
petitioner
had
made
an
exposition
of
the
crime
which
was
incorrect.
the
counsel
had
said
that
negligence
could
constitute
a
crime.
the
last
decision
of
this
court
on
the
defining
tax
evasion,
the
sansone
case
cited
in
our
brief,
indicates
that
willfulness
is
the
characteristic
element
that
specific
intent
is
the
characteristic
element
of
the
crime
when
an
inconsistent
statement
occurs
certainly
there
is
a
duty
of
inquiry.
the
statement
of
the
defendant
himself
at
the
trial
level
was
inconsistent.
mr.
maurice
j.
mccarthy
concerning
the
factual
basis
of
the
plea?
i'm
quite
sure
that
the
--
well,
as
the
notes
of
the
committee
indicate
the
reason
for
that
particular
sentence
was
to
ensure
that
a
defendant
whose
--
who
may
have
understood
the
charge
was
made
was
certain
that
the
acts
which
he
admitted
constituted
the
crime.
i
think
the
reverse
of
that
is
also
true.
an
individual
who
admitted
the
acts
necessary
to
cons
--
mr.
maurice
j.
mccarthy
i'm
sure
that
this
imposes
--
mr.
maurice
j.
mccarthy
this
is
a
second
part
of
our
argument
your
honor
that
there
is
an
abuse
of
discretion
in
this
case.
i
don't
think
that
--
mr.
maurice
j.
mccarthy
exactly,
your
honor
but
i
frame
it
in
terms
of
an
abuse
of
discretion
in
the
part
of
the
district
court
because
i
don't
find
that
language
to
be
sufficiently
specific.
the
language
is
that
the
court
must
be
satisfied.
mr.
maurice
j.
mccarthy
and
that's
why
i
(inaudible)
the
argument
in
terms
of
the
discretion
and
an
abuse
thereof.
the
attorney,
the
counsel
for
the
respondent
argues
that
the
rule
leaves
some
discretion
in
the
district
court
although
he
would
apply
it
also
to
the
first
part
of
rule
of
it
concerning
the
taking
and
accepting
of
the
plea
of
guilty.
however,
the
respondent
does
not
address
himself
to
the
facts
in
this
case
which
we
argue
required
inquiry
by
the
district
judge.
our
third
argument,
--
mr.
maurice
j.
mccarthy
of
course
there
is
responsibility
on
retained
counsel,
your
honor.
mr.
maurice
j.
mccarthy
no,
my
position
--
mr.
maurice
j.
mccarthy
the
court
is
required
under
rule
11
to
address
the
defendant
personally
and
determine
that
he,
the
defendant
understand
the
nature
of
the
charge
and
the
consequences
of
the
plea?
mr.
maurice
j.
mccarthy
well,
i'm
quite
sure
that
being
a
member
of
alcoholics
anonymous
--
mr.
maurice
j.
mccarthy
the
judge
had
the
age
of
the
defendant.
the
defendant
was
65
years
of
age.
he
had
--
mr.
maurice
j.
mccarthy
certainly,
it
is
discretionary.
mr.
maurice
j.
mccarthy
certainly
it's
--
mr.
maurice
j.
mccarthy
well,
the
question
isn't
whether
or
nor
to
put
a
65-year-old
man
in
jail.
the
question
is
whether
or
not
a
65-year-old
man
sufficiently
understands
the
nature
of
the
charge.
this
is
the
question,
whether
he
has
been
informed
and
understands
the
meaning
of
the
accusation.
mr.
maurice
j.
mccarthy
i
think
a
man
more
in
the
prime
of
his
life
would
be
less
likely
to
be
confused
--
mr.
maurice
j.
mccarthy
this
is
perhaps
in
the
discretion
of
the
court
but
this
is
precisely
my
argument
that
the
discretion
of
the
court
was
not
properly
exercised.
mr.
maurice
j.
mccarthy
some
men
of
advanced
years
are
extremely
--
have
extreme
acumen
some
do
not.
mr.
maurice
j.
mccarthy
rule
32
requires
at
the
sentencing
hearing
that
the
district
judge
address
the
defendant
personally
of
this
again
--
mr.
maurice
j.
mccarthy
he
did
inquire
of
the
defendant
at
the
sentencing
hearing
and
the
defendant
said
the
following
--
he
said,
if
it
were
not
for
my
health
and
the
things
that
i
have
gone
through,
it
would
not
have
happen
and
it
is
not
deliberate.
a
statement
such
as
it
is
not
deliberate
is
a
point
blank
denial
of
the
characteristic
element
of
the
crime
under
7201.
mr.
maurice
j.
mccarthy
the
court
should
have
inquired
as
to
what
he
meant
by
“it
is
not
deliberate.”
did
he
mean
--
mr.
maurice
j.
mccarthy
oh!
there
would
have
been
what
the
military
calls
providence
on
the
record.
mr.
maurice
j.
mccarthy
well,
i
cited
to
this
court
cases
from
the
--
mr.
maurice
j.
mccarthy
--
united
states
court
of
military
appeals.
mr.
maurice
j.
mccarthy
i
just
used
the
phraseology
which
they
used.
what
i
mean
is
there
would
have
in
the
record
evidence
to
have
establish
that
in
open
court,
the
defendant
have
been
informed
of
the
charge
and
had
knowingly
pleaded
to
that
charge.
mr.
maurice
j.
mccarthy
i'm
afraid
i
don't.
mr.
maurice
j.
mccarthy
yes,
i
think.
mr.
maurice
j.
mccarthy
yes,
of
course
you're
retained
counsel
does.
my
last
argument
is
on
the
constitutional
question
involved
here
and
i
think
it's
pointed
out
well
by
the
alternative
suggested
by
counsel
for
the
respondent.
counsel
for
the
respondent
says
that
this
is
the
first
case
which
has
come
up
on
a
direct
appeal
from
the
acceptance
of
the
plea
of
guilty
which
was
not
preceded
by
a
motion
to
vacant
or
by
a
motion
to
withdraw.
i
note
in
my
reply
brief,
that
the
authority
say
that
by
the
respondent
for
this
position
that
they
accept
in
usual
methods
are
motion
to
withdraw
or
a
motion
to
vacate,
leave
the
defendant
below
with
unconstitutional
alternatives.
if
he
moves
to
withdraw
the
plea,
he
must
accept
the
burden
of
proving
innocence.
if
he
doest
that,
it
seems
to
me
that
fifth
amendment
guarantee
of
due
process
and
the
presumption
of
innocence
are
reversed.
if
he
should
move
to
vacate
the
sentence
that
motion
under
2255
can
only
be
made
when
the
defendant
is
in
custody.
so
the
alternatives
left
open
to
the
defendant
in
a
situation
such
as
this
are
to
either
go
into
custody
and
move
to
vacate,
or
accept
a
burden
of
proving
innocence.
we
feel
that
this
constitutional
question
has
not
been
answered
by
the
respondent.
we
therefore
respectfully
submit
that
the
judgment
should
be
reversed
and
the
cause
remanded
for
trial.
thank
you.
mr.
maurice
j.
mccarthy
if
i
might
make
two
brief
points
your
honor.
counsel
for
the
respondent
has
brought
up
one
thing
which
we
argued
in
our
brief
and
which
counsel
for
respondent
has
never
answered.
he
said
that
in
accord
of
sorts
was
reached
that
government
counsel
indicated
to
the
judge
when
he
appeared
ex
parte
because
of
the
defendant
silliness
that
the
matter
would
not
go
to
trial
according
to
counsel
for
the
defendant.
later
on,
the
district
court
was
informed
that
there
was
an
understanding
that
tax
and
penalties
would
be
paid.
if
this
is
true
and
we
have
argued,
if
this
is
true,
is
this
not
another
urgency
or
inquiry
that
a
man
who
has
to
the
knowledge
of
the
district
court
been
hospitalized
for
alcoholism
who
could
not
stand
trial
two
weeks
before
he
entered
his
plea
of
guilty
because
of
illness.
is
it
not
significant
that
the
government
now
argues
that
there
might
have
been
some
accord?
i
think
that
this
is
another
point
indicating
that
there
was
a
need
for
the
district
court
to
inquire
in
this
matter
and
that
this
should
not
have
been
left
unnoticed.
lastly,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
finding
which
the
court
has
made
in
this
case
at
page
8
of
the
appendix
is
not
that
there
is
any
determination
on
the
defendant's
understanding.
the
finding
that
the
court
makes
is
that
the
defendant
was
advised
of
the
consequences
are
clearly
in
the
record
is
no
finding
at
all
that
there
was
any
informing
of
the
defendant
as
to
the
nature
of
the
charge,
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
whether
or
not
the
defendant
actually
did
understand
the
charge
and
the
statements
in
the
record
which
give
some
evidence
on
this
matter
are
inconsistent
with
an
understanding
plea
of
guilty
to
a
charge
of
a
crime
which
requires
specific
intent
for
its
fruition.
we
therefore
urge
this
court
--
mr.
maurice
j.
mccarthy
--
excuse
me.
mr.
maurice
j.
mccarthy
well,
i
think
if
the
allocution
that
the
matters,
that
the
very
first
matter
that
came
to
the
judge
in
the
allocution
was
the
defendant's
statement
if
it
were
not
for
my
health
and
the
things
that
i
have
gone
through
it
never
would
have
happened
and
it
was
not
deliberate
and
i
am
sorry,
that
is
almost
verbatim
what
he
said.
i
think
when
you
have
a
specific
intent
crime,
a
statement
such
as,
it
is
not
deliberate,
a
vague,
and
amorphous
statement
of
that
nature
requires
inquiry.
i
think
that
at
that
point
--
mr.
maurice
j.
mccarthy
if
it
is
what
counsel
for
the
respondent
called
an
active
contrition,
it
certainly
is
not
an
admission
of
guilt.
at
no
point
in
this
record
is
there
an
admission
of
guilt,
an
admission
of
understanding,
and
an
admission
that
the
mental
state
necessary
to
the
crime
was
ever
present.
now,
counsel
wants
us
to
go
back
to
the
district
court
and
to
go
through
one
of
the
procedures
which
you
suggests,
one
of
which
would
require
that
the
defendant
be
in
custody.
the
other
procedure
would
require
that
the
defendant
bear
the
burden
of
proving
his
innocence.
we
feel
that
the
constitutional
issue
in
this
has
never
answered
and
that
counsel
has
made
no
attempt
to
answer
it.
we
therefore
respectfully
--
mr.
maurice
j.
mccarthy
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
maurice
j.
mccarthy
a
trial
your
honor.
mr.
maurice
j.
mccarthy
a
trial
on
the
merits
your
honor.
mr.
maurice
j.
mccarthy
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
maurice
j.
mccarthy
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
maurice
j.
mccarthy
i
don't
believe
that
--
mr.
maurice
j.
mccarthy
i
certainly
would
not
foreclose
the
possibility
of
entering
a
guilty
plea
because
that's
a
verge
i
haven't
come
to
yet.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
with
the
evidence
in
the
record,
that
a
plea
of
guilty
would
not
be
made.
mr.
maurice
j.
mccarthy
yes,
your
honor
that's
right.
mr.
maurice
j.
mccarthy
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
maurice
j.
mccarthy
may
it
please
the
court.
maurice
j.
mccarthy
appearing
on
behalf
of
the
petitioner,
william
j.
mccarthy.
i'm
sure
that
the
question
has
occurred
to
the
court
as
well,
cleared
up
initially
the
petitioner
and
i
are
not
related,
the
fact
that
we
have
the
same
last
name
is
purely
coincidence.
the
facts
in
this
case
are
not
complicated.
on
april
1,
1966,
a
three-count
indictment
was
returned
against
the
petitioner
charging
income
tax
evasion
under
section
7201
of
the
internal
revenue
code
and
alleging
that
there
were
deficiencies
and
taxes
of
approximately
$900.00
for
the
year
1959,
$5,000.00
for
the
year
1960,
and
$1,200.00
for
the
year
1961.
on
april
14,
1966,
the
petitioner
appeared
in
the
district
court
with
retained
counsel
and
at
that
time
counsel
waived
the
reading
of
the
indictment
and
entered
a
plea
of
not
guilty
to
each
of
the
three
counts.
the
court
set
the
trial
for
the
13th
of
june
1966,
thereafter,
which
the
record
does
not
disclose
the
trial
was
reset
for
june
30,
1966.
on
june
29,
1966,
government
counsel
appearing
ex
parte
informed
the
court
that
the
petitioner's
illness
made
it
impossible
to
try
the
case
and
asked
for
a
continuance.
the
district
judge
reset
the
case
to
the
15th
of
july.
on
the
15th
of
july
the
petitioner,
again
occurring
with
retained
counsel
appeared
for
the
trial
of
the
case
at
that
time
counsel
for
the
petitioner
informed
the
court
that
he
would
like
to
withdraw
the
plea
of
not
guilty
to
count
2
of
the
indictment
and
to
offer
a
plea
of
guilty
to
that
count
which
was
the
allegation
of
approximately
$500.00
in
unpaid
taxes
for
the
year
1960.
the
court
interrogated
counsel
for
the
government
who
indicated
that
upon
the
plea
of
guilty,
the
acceptance
of
the
plea
of
guilty
rather,
the
government
counsel
would
move
to
dismiss
counts
1
and
3.
the
circuit
--
the
district
judge
at
that
time
questioned
the
defendant
personally
as
to
two
matters.
first
of
all,
he
asked
the
defendant
in
the
trial
level,
if
he
was
aware
that
by
pleading
guilty,
he
waived
his
right
to
a
jury
trial
the
defendant
responded
in
the
affirmative.
he
then
asked
concerning
the
statutory
penalties
of
five
years
imprisonment
and
a
maximum
five-year
imprisonment
and
a
maximum
$10,000
fine.
upon
receiving
affirmative
responses,
the
district
judge
entered
a
finding
of
guilty.
at
this
point,
the
government
counsel
asked
the
district
judge
to
inquire
of
the
defendant
whether
any
threats
or
premises
had
been
made.
the
district
judge
did
inquire
and
received
negative
responses
that
no
threats
had
been
made
and
no
promises
had
been
given.
no
further
questioning
was
had
either
of
the
defendant
or
of
retained
counsel
and
the
case
was
set
for
a
sentencing
hearing
in
september
1966
on
september
14.
at
that
time,
the
petitioner
again
appeared
with
retained
counsel
and
the
district
judge
in
the
elocution
procedure
as
the
defendant
personally
if
he
had
anything
to
say.
the
defendant
response
was
that
if
it
were
not
for
his
health
and
the
things
that
he
had
gone
through,
that
had
never
would
have
happen
and
that
it
was
not
deliberate.
no
further
questions
were
asked
of
the
defendant.
the
petitioner's
counsel
at
that
time
was
present
and
the
district
court
directed
its
attention
to
him.
he
was
asked
if
he
had
a
statement
and
he
made
a
brief
statement.
the
court
then
indicated
that
in
view
of
the
size
of
the
amount
involved
that
the
debtor
in
effect
of
the
sentence
was
necessary
and
entered
a
sentence
of
one
year
imprisonment
and
a
fine
of
a
$2,500.00.
counsel
for
the
petitioner
on
the
district
court
level
then
asked
to
be
heard.
he
addressed
the
district
judge
and
informed
the
district
judge
of
the
facts
concerning
the
character
of
the
defendant
himself.
he
indicated
to
the
court
that
the
defendant
was
at
that
time
of
the
proceedings,
65
years
old
that
he
had
never
been
familiar
with
any
federal
offense
of
any
sort
that
he
had
a
fine
family.
he
further
informed
the
court
that
the
defendant
had
just
recently
approximately
two
months
prior
to
the
sentencing
hearing
which
was
at
approximately
the
same
time
as
the
tender
of
the
plea
of
guilty
that
the
petitioner
had
become
a
member
of
alcoholics
anonymous
because
he
had
been
an
acute
alcoholic
for
some
time.
he
further
informed
the
court
that
at
the
time
that
the
crime
was
allegedly
committed,
that
being
the
time
of
the
filing
of
the
income
tax
return
that
the
petitioner
had
been
involved
in
what
counsel
called
a
protracted
drinking
situation
from
which
he
was
hospitalized.
no
questions
concerning
this
matter
were
asked
of
the
counsel
for
the
defendant
in
the
district
court.
counsel
then
spoke
of
the
nature
of
the
crime
and
of
the
evidence
that
was
present
or
inherently
present
on
the
district
court
level.
his
exposition
of
the
crime
consisted
in
saying
that
the
books
of
the
defendant
had
been
negligently
kept
and
that
this
negligence
amounted
to
one,
it
became
gross
amounted
to
criminal
intent.
the
--
there
was
not
questioning
concerning
the
exposition
of
the
crime.
the
probation
officer
then
informed
the
court
that
the
alcoholic
anonymous
sponsor
of
the
defendant
was
present
in
open
court
and
available
to
testify
concerning
those
matters.
the
district
court
did
no
take
any
testimony
or
confer
with
the
sponsor
from
alcoholics
anonymous.
the
district
court
then
refused
to
vacate
or
suspend
sentence
and
entered
a
state
of
execution
for
approximately
15
days.
the
argument
of
the
petitioner
presents
three
questions.
first
of
these
questions
concerns
federal
rule
11
of
the
rules
of
criminal
procedure
which
was
amended
effective
july
1,
1966
since
this
plea
was
tendered
on
july
15,
1966,
it
is
governed
by
the
rule
as
amended.
that
amendment
and
the
notes
of
the
advisory
committee
to
this
court
concerning
the
addition
of
the
ordering
in
the
rule
which
constitute
the
amendment
is
critical
in
this
case.
the
amendment
required
that
the
district
court
addressed
the
defendant
personally
rather
than
what
had
been
practiced
in
the
past
of
allowing
the
court
to
addressed
counsel
for
the
defendant.
in
this
case,
there
was
no
questioning
of
the
petitioner
other
than
on
the
merits
which
i
have
stated
and
in
the
exposition
of
facts.
our
contention
is
that
amended
rule
11
directs
and
demands
that
the
district
judge
inquire
personally
of
the
defendant
as
to
his
understanding
of
the
nature
of
the
charge.
this
was
never
done.
we
therefore
contend
that
at
the
time
of
the
acceptance
of
the
plea
of
guilty
on
july
15,
1966,
error
was
committed.
we
contend
that
this
error
was
compounded
at
the
sentencing
hearing
which
occurred
in
september
1966
in
that
certain
facts
were
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
district
court
which
required
inquiry.
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
to
this
court
the
universal
opinion
of
the
lower
courts,
the
circuit
courts
that
rule
11
imposes
on
the
district
judge
a
duty
of
inquiry.
we
feel
that
in
view
of
the
facts
presented
to
the
district
judge,
this
duty
of
inquiry
was
very
right
and
yet
no
inquiry
was
had
of
the
defendant
personally
or
even
of
his
counsel
for
that
matter
or
the
other
persons
who
were
available
to
give
information.
mr.
maurice
j.
mccarthy
the
--
there
is
no
provision
in
rule
11
concerning
a
duty
of
inquiry
but
the
provision
in
rule
11
is
that
the
district
judge
must
address
the
defendant
personally
and
determine.
i
draw
from
this
the
conclusion.
mr.
maurice
j.
mccarthy
voluntarily
with
understanding
of
the
nature
of
the
charge
and
the
consequences
of
the
plea.
i
draw
from
this
the
conclusion
and
i
support
it
with
case
law
in
briefs
that
there
is
a
duty
of
inquiry
on
the
district
judge
both
at
the
time
that
the
plea
is
accepted
and
later
when
sentence
is
rendered
against
the
defendant
to
inquire
in
the
event
that
any
fact
is
presented
to
the
judge
concerning
the
nature
of
the
crime
or
the
character
of
the
defendant.
in
this
case,
there
was
no
questioning
whatever.
not
one
question
of
the
petitioner
himself
as
to
what
he
understood
to
be
the
nature
of
the
accusation
nor
of
the
petitioner's
counsel.
both
of
these
persons
were
present
and
available
to
testify
and
much
of
the
confusion
in
the
record
could
have
been
cleared
of
had
the
district
judge
address
questions
to
them.
mr.
maurice
j.
mccarthy
judgment
was
entered
on
september
14,
1966.
mr.
maurice
j.
mccarthy
yes,
he
did
your
honor
but
this
i
--
mr.
maurice
j.
mccarthy
yes,
he
did.
mr.
maurice
j.
mccarthy
no,
there
was
no
finding.
mr.
maurice
j.
mccarthy
i
don't
argue
that
there
must
be
an
explicit
finding.
mr.
maurice
j.
mccarthy
the
rule,
the
wording
of
the
rule
itself
does
not
require
an
explicit
finding.
it
says
that
the
judge
--
mr.
maurice
j.
mccarthy
well,
the
one
thing
i
see
in
there
is
explicit,
is
that
the
judge
must
make
a
determination.
that
the
plea
is
made
voluntarily
with
understanding
of
the
nature
of
the
charge
and
the
consequences
of
the
plea.
mr.
maurice
j.
mccarthy
the
latter
part
of
the
rule,
i
read
to
require
the
judge
to
be
satisfied
in
the
circumstances
that
a
factual
basis
exists
for
the
plea.
now,
it
does
not
say
for
the
charge.
it
does
not
say
that
the
acts
which
constitute
the
charge
that
he
is
satisfied
that
those
acts
occurred.
mr.
maurice
j.
mccarthy
well,
i
think
that
this
is
the
argument
which
we
have
made
your
honor
and
our
brief
is
that
there
are
two
elements
to
the
crime.
since
this
is
a
specific
intent
crime,
there
are
the
acts
and
there
is
the
intent.
mr.
maurice
j.
mccarthy
perhaps
not
as
artistically
as
i
should
have
but
this
is
--
mr.
maurice
j.
mccarthy
as
far
as
i
understand
that
that's
correct.
mr.
maurice
j.
mccarthy
no,
i
don't
think
it
would
your
honor.
i
think
there
must
be.
mr.
maurice
j.
mccarthy
my
argument
is
this.
that
error
occurred
at
the
time
of
acceptance
of
the
plea.
had
that
error
not
occurred,
there
would
have
been
no
presentence
report.
and
i
therefore
do
not
consider
the
presentence
report
as
controlling
in
any
way.
i
feel
thereafter
that
the
matters
occurring
in
open
court
and
the
information
supplied
to
the
district
judge
in
open
court
served
to
compound
the
error
by
indicating
to
the
district
judge
that
there
was
no
factual
basis
for
the
plea.
mr.
maurice
j.
mccarthy
well,
i
have
--
mr.
maurice
j.
mccarthy
i
have
not
argued
with
that
last
part
of
the
rule
is
mandatory
because
of
the
language
of
the
rule
itself.
it
says
the
district
court
must
be
satisfied.
this
is
a
word
which
leaves
some
room
for
argument.
my
position
and
the
position
of
the
petitioner
is
that
in
view
of
the
matters
occurring
in
open
court,
any
decision
which
the
district
court
came
to
was
not
founded
upon
a
reasonable
basis
that
the
court
was
informed
of
matters
which
required
further
inquiry,
was
informed
of
the
age
and
inexperience
with
criminal
matters
of
the
defendant
was
informed
of
his
past
alcoholic
condition
both
at
the
time
of
the
plea
was
tendered
and
at
the
time
that
crime
was
alleged
to
have
been
committed
and
was
informed
that
counsel
for
the
petitioner
had
made
an
exposition
of
the
crime
which
was
incorrect.
the
counsel
had
said
that
negligence
could
constitute
a
crime.
the
last
decision
of
this
court
on
the
defining
tax
evasion,
the
sansone
case
cited
in
our
brief,
indicates
that
willfulness
is
the
characteristic
element
that
specific
intent
is
the
characteristic
element
of
the
crime
when
an
inconsistent
statement
occurs
certainly
there
is
a
duty
of
inquiry.
the
statement
of
the
defendant
himself
at
the
trial
level
was
inconsistent.
mr.
maurice
j.
mccarthy
concerning
the
factual
basis
of
the
plea?
i'm
quite
sure
that
the
--
well,
as
the
notes
of
the
committee
indicate
the
reason
for
that
particular
sentence
was
to
ensure
that
a
defendant
whose
--
who
may
have
understood
the
charge
was
made
was
certain
that
the
acts
which
he
admitted
constituted
the
crime.
i
think
the
reverse
of
that
is
also
true.
an
individual
who
admitted
the
acts
necessary
to
cons
--
mr.
maurice
j.
mccarthy
i'm
sure
that
this
imposes
--
mr.
maurice
j.
mccarthy
this
is
a
second
part
of
our
argument
your
honor
that
there
is
an
abuse
of
discretion
in
this
case.
i
don't
think
that
--
mr.
maurice
j.
mccarthy
exactly,
your
honor
but
i
frame
it
in
terms
of
an
abuse
of
discretion
in
the
part
of
the
district
court
because
i
don't
find
that
language
to
be
sufficiently
specific.
the
language
is
that
the
court
must
be
satisfied.
mr.
maurice
j.
mccarthy
and
that's
why
i
(inaudible)
the
argument
in
terms
of
the
discretion
and
an
abuse
thereof.
the
attorney,
the
counsel
for
the
respondent
argues
that
the
rule
leaves
some
discretion
in
the
district
court
although
he
would
apply
it
also
to
the
first
part
of
rule
of
it
concerning
the
taking
and
accepting
of
the
plea
of
guilty.
however,
the
respondent
does
not
address
himself
to
the
facts
in
this
case
which
we
argue
required
inquiry
by
the
district
judge.
our
third
argument,
--
mr.
maurice
j.
mccarthy
of
course
there
is
responsibility
on
retained
counsel,
your
honor.
mr.
maurice
j.
mccarthy
no,
my
position
--
mr.
maurice
j.
mccarthy
the
court
is
required
under
rule
11
to
address
the
defendant
personally
and
determine
that
he,
the
defendant
understand
the
nature
of
the
charge
and
the
consequences
of
the
plea?
mr.
maurice
j.
mccarthy
well,
i'm
quite
sure
that
being
a
member
of
alcoholics
anonymous
--
mr.
maurice
j.
mccarthy
the
judge
had
the
age
of
the
defendant.
the
defendant
was
65
years
of
age.
he
had
--
mr.
maurice
j.
mccarthy
certainly,
it
is
discretionary.
mr.
maurice
j.
mccarthy
certainly
it's
--
mr.
maurice
j.
mccarthy
well,
the
question
isn't
whether
or
nor
to
put
a
65-year-old
man
in
jail.
the
question
is
whether
or
not
a
65-year-old
man
sufficiently
understands
the
nature
of
the
charge.
this
is
the
question,
whether
he
has
been
informed
and
understands
the
meaning
of
the
accusation.
mr.
maurice
j.
mccarthy
i
think
a
man
more
in
the
prime
of
his
life
would
be
less
likely
to
be
confused
--
mr.
maurice
j.
mccarthy
this
is
perhaps
in
the
discretion
of
the
court
but
this
is
precisely
my
argument
that
the
discretion
of
the
court
was
not
properly
exercised.
mr.
maurice
j.
mccarthy
some
men
of
advanced
years
are
extremely
--
have
extreme
acumen
some
do
not.
mr.
maurice
j.
mccarthy
rule
32
requires
at
the
sentencing
hearing
that
the
district
judge
address
the
defendant
personally
of
this
again
--
mr.
maurice
j.
mccarthy
he
did
inquire
of
the
defendant
at
the
sentencing
hearing
and
the
defendant
said
the
following
--
he
said,
if
it
were
not
for
my
health
and
the
things
that
i
have
gone
through,
it
would
not
have
happen
and
it
is
not
deliberate.
a
statement
such
as
it
is
not
deliberate
is
a
point
blank
denial
of
the
characteristic
element
of
the
crime
under
7201.
mr.
maurice
j.
mccarthy
the
court
should
have
inquired
as
to
what
he
meant
by
“it
is
not
deliberate.”
did
he
mean
--
mr.
maurice
j.
mccarthy
oh!
there
would
have
been
what
the
military
calls
providence
on
the
record.
mr.
maurice
j.
mccarthy
well,
i
cited
to
this
court
cases
from
the
--
mr.
maurice
j.
mccarthy
--
united
states
court
of
military
appeals.
mr.
maurice
j.
mccarthy
i
just
used
the
phraseology
which
they
used.
what
i
mean
is
there
would
have
in
the
record
evidence
to
have
establish
that
in
open
court,
the
defendant
have
been
informed
of
the
charge
and
had
knowingly
pleaded
to
that
charge.
mr.
maurice
j.
mccarthy
i'm
afraid
i
don't.
mr.
maurice
j.
mccarthy
yes,
i
think.
mr.
maurice
j.
mccarthy
yes,
of
course
you're
retained
counsel
does.
my
last
argument
is
on
the
constitutional
question
involved
here
and
i
think
it's
pointed
out
well
by
the
alternative
suggested
by
counsel
for
the
respondent.
counsel
for
the
respondent
says
that
this
is
the
first
case
which
has
come
up
on
a
direct
appeal
from
the
acceptance
of
the
plea
of
guilty
which
was
not
preceded
by
a
motion
to
vacant
or
by
a
motion
to
withdraw.
i
note
in
my
reply
brief,
that
the
authority
say
that
by
the
respondent
for
this
position
that
they
accept
in
usual
methods
are
motion
to
withdraw
or
a
motion
to
vacate,
leave
the
defendant
below
with
unconstitutional
alternatives.
if
he
moves
to
withdraw
the
plea,
he
must
accept
the
burden
of
proving
innocence.
if
he
doest
that,
it
seems
to
me
that
fifth
amendment
guarantee
of
due
process
and
the
presumption
of
innocence
are
reversed.
if
he
should
move
to
vacate
the
sentence
that
motion
under
2255
can
only
be
made
when
the
defendant
is
in
custody.
so
the
alternatives
left
open
to
the
defendant
in
a
situation
such
as
this
are
to
either
go
into
custody
and
move
to
vacate,
or
accept
a
burden
of
proving
innocence.
we
feel
that
this
constitutional
question
has
not
been
answered
by
the
respondent.
we
therefore
respectfully
submit
that
the
judgment
should
be
reversed
and
the
cause
remanded
for
trial.
thank
you.
mr.
maurice
j.
mccarthy
if
i
might
make
two
brief
points
your
honor.
counsel
for
the
respondent
has
brought
up
one
thing
which
we
argued
in
our
brief
and
which
counsel
for
respondent
has
never
answered.
he
said
that
in
accord
of
sorts
was
reached
that
government
counsel
indicated
to
the
judge
when
he
appeared
ex
parte
because
of
the
defendant
silliness
that
the
matter
would
not
go
to
trial
according
to
counsel
for
the
defendant.
later
on,
the
district
court
was
informed
that
there
was
an
understanding
that
tax
and
penalties
would
be
paid.
if
this
is
true
and
we
have
argued,
if
this
is
true,
is
this
not
another
urgency
or
inquiry
that
a
man
who
has
to
the
knowledge
of
the
district
court
been
hospitalized
for
alcoholism
who
could
not
stand
trial
two
weeks
before
he
entered
his
plea
of
guilty
because
of
illness.
is
it
not
significant
that
the
government
now
argues
that
there
might
have
been
some
accord?
i
think
that
this
is
another
point
indicating
that
there
was
a
need
for
the
district
court
to
inquire
in
this
matter
and
that
this
should
not
have
been
left
unnoticed.
lastly,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
finding
which
the
court
has
made
in
this
case
at
page
8
of
the
appendix
is
not
that
there
is
any
determination
on
the
defendant's
understanding.
the
finding
that
the
court
makes
is
that
the
defendant
was
advised
of
the
consequences
are
clearly
in
the
record
is
no
finding
at
all
that
there
was
any
informing
of
the
defendant
as
to
the
nature
of
the
charge,
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
whether
or
not
the
defendant
actually
did
understand
the
charge
and
the
statements
in
the
record
which
give
some
evidence
on
this
matter
are
inconsistent
with
an
understanding
plea
of
guilty
to
a
charge
of
a
crime
which
requires
specific
intent
for
its
fruition.
we
therefore
urge
this
court
--
mr.
maurice
j.
mccarthy
--
excuse
me.
mr.
maurice
j.
mccarthy
well,
i
think
if
the
allocution
that
the
matters,
that
the
very
first
matter
that
came
to
the
judge
in
the
allocution
was
the
defendant's
statement
if
it
were
not
for
my
health
and
the
things
that
i
have
gone
through
it
never
would
have
happened
and
it
was
not
deliberate
and
i
am
sorry,
that
is
almost
verbatim
what
he
said.
i
think
when
you
have
a
specific
intent
crime,
a
statement
such
as,
it
is
not
deliberate,
a
vague,
and
amorphous
statement
of
that
nature
requires
inquiry.
i
think
that
at
that
point
--
mr.
maurice
j.
mccarthy
if
it
is
what
counsel
for
the
respondent
called
an
active
contrition,
it
certainly
is
not
an
admission
of
guilt.
at
no
point
in
this
record
is
there
an
admission
of
guilt,
an
admission
of
understanding,
and
an
admission
that
the
mental
state
necessary
to
the
crime
was
ever
present.
now,
counsel
wants
us
to
go
back
to
the
district
court
and
to
go
through
one
of
the
procedures
which
you
suggests,
one
of
which
would
require
that
the
defendant
be
in
custody.
the
other
procedure
would
require
that
the
defendant
bear
the
burden
of
proving
his
innocence.
we
feel
that
the
constitutional
issue
in
this
has
never
answered
and
that
counsel
has
made
no
attempt
to
answer
it.
we
therefore
respectfully
--
mr.
maurice
j.
mccarthy
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
maurice
j.
mccarthy
a
trial
your
honor.
mr.
maurice
j.
mccarthy
a
trial
on
the
merits
your
honor.
mr.
maurice
j.
mccarthy
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
maurice
j.
mccarthy
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
maurice
j.
mccarthy
i
don't
believe
that
--
mr.
maurice
j.
mccarthy
i
certainly
would
not
foreclose
the
possibility
of
entering
a
guilty
plea
because
that's
a
verge
i
haven't
come
to
yet.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
with
the
evidence
in
the
record,
that
a
plea
of
guilty
would
not
be
made.
mr.
maurice
j.
mccarthy
yes,
your
honor
that's
right.
mr.
maurice
j.
mccarthy
thank
you
your
honor.
