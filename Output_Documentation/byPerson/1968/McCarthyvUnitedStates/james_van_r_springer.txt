mr.
james
van
r.
springer
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
court
is
handicapped
we
feel
in
this
case
because
it
is
your
honor
direct
appeal
as
the
petitioner
points
out.
although
he
--
as
i
understand
it
still
makes
two
claims,
one,
that
there
was
not
sufficient
objective
factual
basis
for
the
entry
of
the
judgment
on
his
plea
and
two,
that
before
accepting
the
plea,
the
trial
judge
did
not
make
an
adequate
determination
as
to
his
subjective
understanding
of
the
nature
of
the
charges.
although
the
petitioner's
case
is
based
upon
these
two
contentions,
we
in
fact
have
no
testimony
by
the
defendant
as
to
whether
or
not
he
did
understand
the
charges
and
not
even
in
a
factual
allegation
that
he
did
not
understand
the
charges.
and
also
we
have
little
if
any
direct
evidence
relating
to
the
charges
themselves
upon
which
we
can
determine
whether
or
not
there
was
in
fact
an
objective
basis.
however,
the
record
does
indicate
a
number
of
the
circumstances
surrounding
this
plea
and
the
entry
of
judgment
upon
it
and
we
feel
that's
it's
important
to
bear
some
of
this
in
mind.
first
of
all,
the
nature
of
the
charge
itself,
the
indictment
which
related
to
tax
deficiencies
in
one
year
of
1960
is
simple
and
straight
forward.
it
charged
that
the
defendant
willfully
and
knowingly
attempted
to
evade
his
taxes
for
that
year
by
willfully
and
knowingly
filing
a
tax
return
understating
his
income
by
some
$13,000.00
which
was
somewhat
more
than
40%
of
the
total
alleged
income
for
that
year.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes.
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
well
of
course,
there
was
no
specific
finding.
he
pleaded
guilty
to
a
deficiency
of
approximately
$13,000.00.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
i'm
sorry.
in
that
one
year
of
1960,
there
was
an
alleged
deficiency
of
$13,000.00
that
was
somewhat
smaller
deficiencies
alleged
in
the
years
1959
and
1961.
and
those
accounts
were
dismissed.
i
might
point
out
however
they
were
dismissed
upon
an
understanding
expressed
by
government
counsel
to
which
petitioner's
counsel
agree
that
the
taxes
for
all
three
years
would
be
paid.
from
this,
i
think
it's
fair
to
infer
that
there
was
never
any
dispute
as
to
the
actual
existence
of
a
tax
deficiency.
accordingly,
the
only
fact
issue
in
the
case
was
the
issue
of
the
defendant's
intent
whether
he
willfully
filed
a
false
tax
return.
so
there
was
no,
we
submit
possibility
of
any
confusion
as
to
lesser
included
offenses
or
anything.
it
was
a
simple
factual
question
of
willfulness.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
mr.
chief
justice
i
believe,
it
would
not.
this
court
held
in
sansone
that
all
of
the
criminal
tax
provisions
coalesce
as
it
were
in
the
case
where
the
charge
is
the
filing
of
a
return
that
falsely
stated
income.
accordingly,
if
the
court
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
in
fact,
i
believe
it
would
have
been
no
offense
at
all.
none
of
the
criminal
provisions
would
apply.
since
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
--
each
of
the
three
basic
ones
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
--each
requires
will
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
no,
in
fact
that
is
i
believe
what
this
court
held
in
the
sansone
case.
there
are
none
as
to
which
instructions
are
required
to
be
given.
it's
either
all
or
nothing.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
he
does
but
when
the
charge
is
made,
it
is
a
single
question
and
there
is
the
one
question
of
willfulness.
before
he
pleaded,
the
defendant
had
as
the
record
shows
had
retained
counsel
for
a
period
of
at
least
three
months.
there
was
an
indication
some
two
weeks
before
he
finally
pleaded
guilty
that
petitioner's
counsel
had
led
that
the
governor's
counsel
to
believe
that
there
would
not
be
a
trial
case.
from
this,
we
think
it's
reasonable
to
infer
that
there
were
substantial
discussions
about
the
charges
between
the
defendant
and
his
counsel
and
we're
trying
it
hard
to
believe
that
those
charges,
that
those
discussions
would
not
have
explored
fully
the
single
fact
issue
in
the
case.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
in
fact
it's
our
position
that
if
in
fact
the
defendant
now
has
available
to
him
some
factual
indication
that
the
plea
was
not
knowing
or
for
that
matter
that
there
was
not
an
adequate
factual
basis
for
the
plea,
he
can
raised
this
collaterally.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
but
as
i
say
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
no,
we
would
not
stand
on
the
proposition
that
that
is
the
only
time
it
could
be
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
and
in
fact
we
would
submit
that
there's
no
substance
to
the
petitioner's
contentions
that
he
is
in
any
way
barred
from
raising
this
matter
either
under
rule
32
(b)
or
under
rule
2255.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
yes.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
in
fact,
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
in
fact
to
the
first
point,
we
would
submit
that
there
is
enough
in
this
record
to
show
that
there
was
ample
basis
for
the
inference
which
the
prior
judge
evidently
made
that
the
defendant
understood
the
nature
of
the
charges.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
mr.
justice
we
do
not
believe
however
that
there's
anything
in
the
world
that
requires
a
specific
identifiable
finding
in
the
record.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
no,
no
we
are
prepared
to
argue
to
the
contrary
though
there
is
enough
evidence
in
the
record
to
support
such
an
inference.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
yes
we
certainly
do.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
well
on
the
basis
of
the
compliance
by
the
court
with
the
real
substance
of
rule
11
which
we
feel
is
that
a
determination
at
least
within
the
judges
on
mind
be
made
and
that
there
be
an
adequate
basis
for
that
determination.
we
concede
of
course
that
it
would
have
been
better
if
the
judge
had
specifically
addressed
the
defendant
as
to
his
understanding
of
the
charges.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
in
effect
he
did
that
based
on
his
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
would
think
so
and
that
plus
some
other
related
discussions
plus
in
fact
what
the
defendant's
counsel
said
at
the
sentencing
indicates
that
the
judge
of
course
familiar
with
the
presentence
report.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
this
is
really
the
objective
question
and
the
other
is
the
subjective
question
as
to
voluntariness
and
so
forth.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
--
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
suggest
that
that
perhaps
becomes
a
semantic
question
of
course
we
cannot
contend
that
he
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
well,
of
course
i
have
to
say
that
the
rule
11
did
direct
him
to
address
the
defendant
and
he
did
not
do
that.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
in
that
sense.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
certainly
not,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
because
i
think
that
the
fact
that
judge
did
not
fully
comply
with
rule
11
is
not
dispositive
of
this
case.
because
the
question
is
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
well,
first
we
would
say
there
was
an
effect
to
determination.
if
however,
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
--
this
court
does
not
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
as
i
say
mr.
chief
justice,
that
we
have
to
concede.
however,
the
fundamental
question
here
at
least
on
the
subject
of
issue
is
whether
in
fact
the
defendant
did
understand
the
charge.
if
there
is
a
question
on
this
record
as
to
whether
or
not
he
did,
we
submit
that
it
would
not
be
prejudicial
to
the
defendant
to
have
a
hearing
on
that
issue.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
well,
i
think
that
there's
--
those
i
believe
are
counsel's
inferences
from
the
record
which
i
believe
on
its
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
if
the
reference
is
to
statements
by
the
defendant's
counsel
at
the
sentencing
hearing
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
suggest
that
reading
those
statements
as
a
whole
does
not
to
my
mind
at
least
disclose
any
inconsistency
with
either
the
existence
of
the
factual
basis
for
the
charges
or
the
defendant's
understanding.
i
think
that
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
if
it
be
so,
i
have
to
concede
that
our
case
does
to
that
extent
depend
upon
that.
we
do
insist
however
that
the
government
should
be
allowed
at
least
to
meet
the
burden
which
we
prepared
to
accept
of
proving
on
a
hearing
that
the
defendant
did
plead
with
an
understanding
of
the
charges
against
him.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
mr.
justice
black,
that
in
fact
is
a
quotation
by
the
court
of
appeals
confirm
the
plead
record
which
is
set
forth
completely
at
pages
6
through
8.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
he
did
not
directly.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
no,
mr.
justice
black.
he
did
of
course
directly
address
him
and
questioned
him
at
some
length
on
other
questions.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes.
what
--
the
subject
on
which
he
did
not
directly
address
the
defendant
at
which
he
is
raise
here
is
that
the
question
of
the
defendant's
understanding
of
the
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
--
charges.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
he
asked
him
whether
he
understood
the
--
that
he
would
be
depriving
himself
to
a
jury
trial
by
pleading
guilty
whether
he
understood
that
he
would
be
subjecting
himself
to
a
long
sentence
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
--
whether
he
was
pleading
voluntarily,
whether
any
promises
had
been
made
to
him,
or
whether
any
threats
had
been
made
to
induce
the
plea.
we
do
have
to
conceive,
in
other
words
the
one
further
question
which
the
judge
preferably
would
have
asked
or
perhaps
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
--
a
series
of
questions
about
the
understanding
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
think
it
would
not
be
enough
simply
to
say,
do
you
understand
the
charge?
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
think
in
this
case
because
of
the
simplicity
of
the
case,
it
could
have
been
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
because
of
the
simplicity
of
the
charge
it
could
have
been
a
simple
question.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
he
did
not
ask,
do
you
understand
that
in
order
to
be
convicted
of
this
charge,
you
must
have
willfully
filed
a
false
tax
return
understating
your
income?
that
on
the
subject
of
question
is
the
single
issue
in
this
case
whether
or
not
the
defendant
did
understand
that
requirement.
as
i
have
said,
we
believe
that
the
record
does
indicate
that
first
that
the
judge
so
determined
and
second,
that
he
had
a
basis
for
doing
so
if
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
well,
mr.
justice
black
the
rule
does
say
that
he
shall
personally
address
the
defendant
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
--
and
determining.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
that
the
plea
is
made
voluntarily
and
with
the
understanding
of
the
nature
of
the
charges.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
he
did.
he
did
not
however
ask
him
if
it
was
made
with
the
understanding
of
the
nature
of
the
charges.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
and
that
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes
and
what
we
have
to
concede
that
that
is
something
that
the
rule
directed
him
to
do
that
he
did
not.
however
we
do
submit
that
it
was
hard
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
as
to
the
basis
for
the
inference
which
we
feel
the
district
judge
properly
drew
characterize
it
as
you
will,
the
defendant
was
a
mature
man.
he
was
a
business
man.
he
had
counsel
for
some
months.
just
before
he
was
called
upon
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
it
appears
that
he
was
some
kind
of
printing
jobber
at
the
end
of
the
sentencing
proceeding
was
a
reference
to
a
request
for
a
stay
of
execution
of
the
sentence
because
he
was
handling
the
printing
of
some
ballots
for
the
county
at
that
time.
that's
the
only
indication
that
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
on
direct
appeal?
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
submit
that
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
mr.
justice.
in
fact
that
is
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i'm
sorry.
why
should
he
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
why?
the
problem
here
i
think
is
that
when
a
defendant
has
pleaded
guilty,
the
system
is
set
up
in
such
a
way
that
he
should
not
and
will
be
able
to
withdraw
his
plea
after
he
determines
what
his
sentence
will
be.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
would
simply
urged
that
the
kind
of
the
outburst
of
that
that
having
pleaded
guilty
he
should
not
have
the
option
of
undoing
what
we
believe
the
record
shows
was
a
thoroughly
considered
intelligent
act
on
his
part.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
of
course
the
rule
32
relating
to
that
does
draw
a
distinction
between
a
withdrawal
of
the
plea
before
a
sentencing
which
can
be
done
quite
freely
and
the
withdrawal
of
the
plea
after
sentencing
which
can
be
only
done
only
upon
a
showing
of
manifest
into
justice.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
no,
certainly
not
mr.
justice
and
we
would
urge
that
that
is
a
--
if
this
record
is
not
sufficient
to
support
the
acceptance
of
the
plea
and
the
entry
of
judgment
upon
it
that
those
facts
should
be
explored
in
a
hearing
so
that
we
will
know
whether
or
not
there
was
a
factual
cases
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
we
would
suggest
that
it
would
be
more
orderly
if
it
were
done
collaterally.
alternatively,
we
would
suggest
that
at
the
very
least,
this
case
should
be
disposed
off
by
a
remand
for
a
hearing
rather
than
by
a
vacation
of
the
judgment
with
the
option
then
in
the
defendant
to
plead
again.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
it
is
raised
only
on
appeal
however.
it
was
never
raised
before
the
jury.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
no,
i
think
the
discussion
towards
the
references
had
been
made
or
a
discussion
in
elaboration
of
the
defendants
statement
in
allocution
that
the
lawyer
was
not
arguing
that
the
plea
was
improper
and
that
he
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
about
the
plea,
he
said
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
he
said
nothing
directly
about
the
defendant's
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
it's
a
rather
elaborate
statement.
the
part
that
starts
off
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
it
appears
in
a
number
of
places
in
trial
counsel
statement
on
seeking
to
mitigate
the
sentence
that
refers
to
problems
that
relate
to
drinking
in
this
case.
this
man
has
experienced
a
kind
of
punishment
self-inflicted
which
is
almost
a
categorical
listing
of
how
he
flees.
it's
a
somewhat
a
disjointed
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
--
statement.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
think
not
speaking
very
honestly
upon
a
whole
in
reading
of
the
entire
record.
in
fact
counsel's
principal
point
was
that
the
concealment's
and
dubious
acts
which
resulted
in
this
tax
evasion
were
carried
out
for
the
purpose
of
secreting
funds
so
that
as
i
interpret
it
so
that
the
defendant
could
purchase
liquor
and
so
forth
without
his
families
knowing
about
it.
that
was
the
thrust
of
counsel's
argument
rather
than
any
what
i
considered
to
be
suggestion
that
in
fact
the
defendant
was
not
responsible.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
the
word
he
used
mr.
chief
justice
in
fact
was
neglect.
i'm
not
sure
that
there's
a
distinction.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
but
he
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
would
suggest
that
what
he
seems
to
me
to
have
been
meaning
by
neglect
was
the
failure
to
do
something,
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
--
the
failure
to
record
income
accurately.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
however
this
man
was
an
experienced
lawyer.
the
court
of
appeals
pointed
out
that
he
was
a
former
assistant
of
the
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
--
united
states
attorney.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes.
as
i
would
suggest
that
the
record
does
not
support
an
inference
that
counsel
was
confused
as
to
the
nature
of
charges.
and
i
think
it
is
important
to
bear
in
mind
what
counsel's
purpose
in
making
the
statement
was.
this
was
at
the
sentencing
hearing.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
only
say
that
in
this
case,
because
of
the
failure
to
make
that
simple
inquiry
at
the
plead
receiving,
the
government
has
imposed
upon
it
what
may
be
the
subversive
substantial
burden
of
going
through
a
collateral
proceeding
having
to
prove
that
in
fact
there
was
an
understanding
of
the
nature
of
the
charges.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
he
did
fail.
he
did
fail
to
inquire
about
that.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
yes,
yes,
we
do
mr.
justice.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
well,
perhaps
i
should
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
there
are
several
court
of
appeals
cases.perhaps,
i
–-
just
to
be
absolutely
thorough
i
should
rephrase
that
point.
the
question
that
we
say
could
be
raised
on
collateral
attack
is
the
question
whether
in
fact
the
defendant
understood
that
nature
of
the
charge
at
the
time
of
the
plea
not
what
transpired
on
the
record
between
the
judge
and
the
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
--
and
the
defendant.
it's
this
question
of
actual
understanding.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
and
that
information
as
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
--
far
as
the
record
shows.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
think
there
should
be
some
indication
in
the
record.
i
think
it
was
sufficient
here
without
even
some
of
the
colloquy.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
the
crucial
point
being
that
it
is
indicated
that
the
judge
considered
a
presentence
report.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
no,
we
would
suggest
that
sufficiently
implicit
in
the
entry
of
judgment
and
i
think
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
no,
the
judge
did
not
say
i
am
satisfied
or
would
we
suggest
that
the
language
in
the
last
sentence
of
rule
11
was
chosen
advisably.
it
contemplates
an
informal
determination
by
the
use
of
the
words
satisfy
and
that
requirement
is
fulfilled
here.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
under
a
contemporaneous
amendment
as
the
court
knows
of
rule
32
(a),
the
trial
judge
has
told
that
he
may
make
the
presentence
report
available
as
i
have
requested.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
no,
here
was
not
made
available
to
the
defendant.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
that
certainly
is,
it's
not
precluded.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
no.
we
would
suggest
however
that
it
is
not
--
it
should
not
be
required
to
satisfy
the
last
sentence
of
rule
11
that
the
record
support
with
appropriate
evidence
the
determination
of
satisfaction
that
the
trial
judge
makes.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
there
is
very
little,
we
have
to
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
there
is
nothing
in
the
ordinary
sense
of
evidence,
yes.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
court
is
handicapped
we
feel
in
this
case
because
it
is
your
honor
direct
appeal
as
the
petitioner
points
out.
although
he
--
as
i
understand
it
still
makes
two
claims,
one,
that
there
was
not
sufficient
objective
factual
basis
for
the
entry
of
the
judgment
on
his
plea
and
two,
that
before
accepting
the
plea,
the
trial
judge
did
not
make
an
adequate
determination
as
to
his
subjective
understanding
of
the
nature
of
the
charges.
although
the
petitioner's
case
is
based
upon
these
two
contentions,
we
in
fact
have
no
testimony
by
the
defendant
as
to
whether
or
not
he
did
understand
the
charges
and
not
even
in
a
factual
allegation
that
he
did
not
understand
the
charges.
and
also
we
have
little
if
any
direct
evidence
relating
to
the
charges
themselves
upon
which
we
can
determine
whether
or
not
there
was
in
fact
an
objective
basis.
however,
the
record
does
indicate
a
number
of
the
circumstances
surrounding
this
plea
and
the
entry
of
judgment
upon
it
and
we
feel
that's
it's
important
to
bear
some
of
this
in
mind.
first
of
all,
the
nature
of
the
charge
itself,
the
indictment
which
related
to
tax
deficiencies
in
one
year
of
1960
is
simple
and
straight
forward.
it
charged
that
the
defendant
willfully
and
knowingly
attempted
to
evade
his
taxes
for
that
year
by
willfully
and
knowingly
filing
a
tax
return
understating
his
income
by
some
$13,000.00
which
was
somewhat
more
than
40%
of
the
total
alleged
income
for
that
year.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes.
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
well
of
course,
there
was
no
specific
finding.
he
pleaded
guilty
to
a
deficiency
of
approximately
$13,000.00.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
i'm
sorry.
in
that
one
year
of
1960,
there
was
an
alleged
deficiency
of
$13,000.00
that
was
somewhat
smaller
deficiencies
alleged
in
the
years
1959
and
1961.
and
those
accounts
were
dismissed.
i
might
point
out
however
they
were
dismissed
upon
an
understanding
expressed
by
government
counsel
to
which
petitioner's
counsel
agree
that
the
taxes
for
all
three
years
would
be
paid.
from
this,
i
think
it's
fair
to
infer
that
there
was
never
any
dispute
as
to
the
actual
existence
of
a
tax
deficiency.
accordingly,
the
only
fact
issue
in
the
case
was
the
issue
of
the
defendant's
intent
whether
he
willfully
filed
a
false
tax
return.
so
there
was
no,
we
submit
possibility
of
any
confusion
as
to
lesser
included
offenses
or
anything.
it
was
a
simple
factual
question
of
willfulness.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
mr.
chief
justice
i
believe,
it
would
not.
this
court
held
in
sansone
that
all
of
the
criminal
tax
provisions
coalesce
as
it
were
in
the
case
where
the
charge
is
the
filing
of
a
return
that
falsely
stated
income.
accordingly,
if
the
court
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
in
fact,
i
believe
it
would
have
been
no
offense
at
all.
none
of
the
criminal
provisions
would
apply.
since
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
--
each
of
the
three
basic
ones
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
--each
requires
will
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
no,
in
fact
that
is
i
believe
what
this
court
held
in
the
sansone
case.
there
are
none
as
to
which
instructions
are
required
to
be
given.
it's
either
all
or
nothing.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
he
does
but
when
the
charge
is
made,
it
is
a
single
question
and
there
is
the
one
question
of
willfulness.
before
he
pleaded,
the
defendant
had
as
the
record
shows
had
retained
counsel
for
a
period
of
at
least
three
months.
there
was
an
indication
some
two
weeks
before
he
finally
pleaded
guilty
that
petitioner's
counsel
had
led
that
the
governor's
counsel
to
believe
that
there
would
not
be
a
trial
case.
from
this,
we
think
it's
reasonable
to
infer
that
there
were
substantial
discussions
about
the
charges
between
the
defendant
and
his
counsel
and
we're
trying
it
hard
to
believe
that
those
charges,
that
those
discussions
would
not
have
explored
fully
the
single
fact
issue
in
the
case.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
in
fact
it's
our
position
that
if
in
fact
the
defendant
now
has
available
to
him
some
factual
indication
that
the
plea
was
not
knowing
or
for
that
matter
that
there
was
not
an
adequate
factual
basis
for
the
plea,
he
can
raised
this
collaterally.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
but
as
i
say
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
no,
we
would
not
stand
on
the
proposition
that
that
is
the
only
time
it
could
be
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
and
in
fact
we
would
submit
that
there's
no
substance
to
the
petitioner's
contentions
that
he
is
in
any
way
barred
from
raising
this
matter
either
under
rule
32
(b)
or
under
rule
2255.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
yes.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
in
fact,
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
in
fact
to
the
first
point,
we
would
submit
that
there
is
enough
in
this
record
to
show
that
there
was
ample
basis
for
the
inference
which
the
prior
judge
evidently
made
that
the
defendant
understood
the
nature
of
the
charges.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
mr.
justice
we
do
not
believe
however
that
there's
anything
in
the
world
that
requires
a
specific
identifiable
finding
in
the
record.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
no,
no
we
are
prepared
to
argue
to
the
contrary
though
there
is
enough
evidence
in
the
record
to
support
such
an
inference.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
yes
we
certainly
do.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
well
on
the
basis
of
the
compliance
by
the
court
with
the
real
substance
of
rule
11
which
we
feel
is
that
a
determination
at
least
within
the
judges
on
mind
be
made
and
that
there
be
an
adequate
basis
for
that
determination.
we
concede
of
course
that
it
would
have
been
better
if
the
judge
had
specifically
addressed
the
defendant
as
to
his
understanding
of
the
charges.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
in
effect
he
did
that
based
on
his
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
would
think
so
and
that
plus
some
other
related
discussions
plus
in
fact
what
the
defendant's
counsel
said
at
the
sentencing
indicates
that
the
judge
of
course
familiar
with
the
presentence
report.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
this
is
really
the
objective
question
and
the
other
is
the
subjective
question
as
to
voluntariness
and
so
forth.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
--
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
suggest
that
that
perhaps
becomes
a
semantic
question
of
course
we
cannot
contend
that
he
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
well,
of
course
i
have
to
say
that
the
rule
11
did
direct
him
to
address
the
defendant
and
he
did
not
do
that.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
in
that
sense.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
certainly
not,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
because
i
think
that
the
fact
that
judge
did
not
fully
comply
with
rule
11
is
not
dispositive
of
this
case.
because
the
question
is
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
well,
first
we
would
say
there
was
an
effect
to
determination.
if
however,
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
--
this
court
does
not
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
as
i
say
mr.
chief
justice,
that
we
have
to
concede.
however,
the
fundamental
question
here
at
least
on
the
subject
of
issue
is
whether
in
fact
the
defendant
did
understand
the
charge.
if
there
is
a
question
on
this
record
as
to
whether
or
not
he
did,
we
submit
that
it
would
not
be
prejudicial
to
the
defendant
to
have
a
hearing
on
that
issue.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
well,
i
think
that
there's
--
those
i
believe
are
counsel's
inferences
from
the
record
which
i
believe
on
its
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
if
the
reference
is
to
statements
by
the
defendant's
counsel
at
the
sentencing
hearing
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
suggest
that
reading
those
statements
as
a
whole
does
not
to
my
mind
at
least
disclose
any
inconsistency
with
either
the
existence
of
the
factual
basis
for
the
charges
or
the
defendant's
understanding.
i
think
that
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
if
it
be
so,
i
have
to
concede
that
our
case
does
to
that
extent
depend
upon
that.
we
do
insist
however
that
the
government
should
be
allowed
at
least
to
meet
the
burden
which
we
prepared
to
accept
of
proving
on
a
hearing
that
the
defendant
did
plead
with
an
understanding
of
the
charges
against
him.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
mr.
justice
black,
that
in
fact
is
a
quotation
by
the
court
of
appeals
confirm
the
plead
record
which
is
set
forth
completely
at
pages
6
through
8.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
he
did
not
directly.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
no,
mr.
justice
black.
he
did
of
course
directly
address
him
and
questioned
him
at
some
length
on
other
questions.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes.
what
--
the
subject
on
which
he
did
not
directly
address
the
defendant
at
which
he
is
raise
here
is
that
the
question
of
the
defendant's
understanding
of
the
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
--
charges.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
he
asked
him
whether
he
understood
the
--
that
he
would
be
depriving
himself
to
a
jury
trial
by
pleading
guilty
whether
he
understood
that
he
would
be
subjecting
himself
to
a
long
sentence
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
--
whether
he
was
pleading
voluntarily,
whether
any
promises
had
been
made
to
him,
or
whether
any
threats
had
been
made
to
induce
the
plea.
we
do
have
to
conceive,
in
other
words
the
one
further
question
which
the
judge
preferably
would
have
asked
or
perhaps
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
--
a
series
of
questions
about
the
understanding
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
think
it
would
not
be
enough
simply
to
say,
do
you
understand
the
charge?
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
think
in
this
case
because
of
the
simplicity
of
the
case,
it
could
have
been
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
because
of
the
simplicity
of
the
charge
it
could
have
been
a
simple
question.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
he
did
not
ask,
do
you
understand
that
in
order
to
be
convicted
of
this
charge,
you
must
have
willfully
filed
a
false
tax
return
understating
your
income?
that
on
the
subject
of
question
is
the
single
issue
in
this
case
whether
or
not
the
defendant
did
understand
that
requirement.
as
i
have
said,
we
believe
that
the
record
does
indicate
that
first
that
the
judge
so
determined
and
second,
that
he
had
a
basis
for
doing
so
if
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
well,
mr.
justice
black
the
rule
does
say
that
he
shall
personally
address
the
defendant
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
--
and
determining.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
that
the
plea
is
made
voluntarily
and
with
the
understanding
of
the
nature
of
the
charges.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
he
did.
he
did
not
however
ask
him
if
it
was
made
with
the
understanding
of
the
nature
of
the
charges.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
and
that
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes
and
what
we
have
to
concede
that
that
is
something
that
the
rule
directed
him
to
do
that
he
did
not.
however
we
do
submit
that
it
was
hard
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
as
to
the
basis
for
the
inference
which
we
feel
the
district
judge
properly
drew
characterize
it
as
you
will,
the
defendant
was
a
mature
man.
he
was
a
business
man.
he
had
counsel
for
some
months.
just
before
he
was
called
upon
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
it
appears
that
he
was
some
kind
of
printing
jobber
at
the
end
of
the
sentencing
proceeding
was
a
reference
to
a
request
for
a
stay
of
execution
of
the
sentence
because
he
was
handling
the
printing
of
some
ballots
for
the
county
at
that
time.
that's
the
only
indication
that
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
on
direct
appeal?
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
submit
that
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
mr.
justice.
in
fact
that
is
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i'm
sorry.
why
should
he
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
why?
the
problem
here
i
think
is
that
when
a
defendant
has
pleaded
guilty,
the
system
is
set
up
in
such
a
way
that
he
should
not
and
will
be
able
to
withdraw
his
plea
after
he
determines
what
his
sentence
will
be.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
would
simply
urged
that
the
kind
of
the
outburst
of
that
that
having
pleaded
guilty
he
should
not
have
the
option
of
undoing
what
we
believe
the
record
shows
was
a
thoroughly
considered
intelligent
act
on
his
part.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
of
course
the
rule
32
relating
to
that
does
draw
a
distinction
between
a
withdrawal
of
the
plea
before
a
sentencing
which
can
be
done
quite
freely
and
the
withdrawal
of
the
plea
after
sentencing
which
can
be
only
done
only
upon
a
showing
of
manifest
into
justice.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
no,
certainly
not
mr.
justice
and
we
would
urge
that
that
is
a
--
if
this
record
is
not
sufficient
to
support
the
acceptance
of
the
plea
and
the
entry
of
judgment
upon
it
that
those
facts
should
be
explored
in
a
hearing
so
that
we
will
know
whether
or
not
there
was
a
factual
cases
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
we
would
suggest
that
it
would
be
more
orderly
if
it
were
done
collaterally.
alternatively,
we
would
suggest
that
at
the
very
least,
this
case
should
be
disposed
off
by
a
remand
for
a
hearing
rather
than
by
a
vacation
of
the
judgment
with
the
option
then
in
the
defendant
to
plead
again.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
it
is
raised
only
on
appeal
however.
it
was
never
raised
before
the
jury.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
no,
i
think
the
discussion
towards
the
references
had
been
made
or
a
discussion
in
elaboration
of
the
defendants
statement
in
allocution
that
the
lawyer
was
not
arguing
that
the
plea
was
improper
and
that
he
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
about
the
plea,
he
said
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
he
said
nothing
directly
about
the
defendant's
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
it's
a
rather
elaborate
statement.
the
part
that
starts
off
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
it
appears
in
a
number
of
places
in
trial
counsel
statement
on
seeking
to
mitigate
the
sentence
that
refers
to
problems
that
relate
to
drinking
in
this
case.
this
man
has
experienced
a
kind
of
punishment
self-inflicted
which
is
almost
a
categorical
listing
of
how
he
flees.
it's
a
somewhat
a
disjointed
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
--
statement.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
think
not
speaking
very
honestly
upon
a
whole
in
reading
of
the
entire
record.
in
fact
counsel's
principal
point
was
that
the
concealment's
and
dubious
acts
which
resulted
in
this
tax
evasion
were
carried
out
for
the
purpose
of
secreting
funds
so
that
as
i
interpret
it
so
that
the
defendant
could
purchase
liquor
and
so
forth
without
his
families
knowing
about
it.
that
was
the
thrust
of
counsel's
argument
rather
than
any
what
i
considered
to
be
suggestion
that
in
fact
the
defendant
was
not
responsible.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
the
word
he
used
mr.
chief
justice
in
fact
was
neglect.
i'm
not
sure
that
there's
a
distinction.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
but
he
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
would
suggest
that
what
he
seems
to
me
to
have
been
meaning
by
neglect
was
the
failure
to
do
something,
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
--
the
failure
to
record
income
accurately.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
however
this
man
was
an
experienced
lawyer.
the
court
of
appeals
pointed
out
that
he
was
a
former
assistant
of
the
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
--
united
states
attorney.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes.
as
i
would
suggest
that
the
record
does
not
support
an
inference
that
counsel
was
confused
as
to
the
nature
of
charges.
and
i
think
it
is
important
to
bear
in
mind
what
counsel's
purpose
in
making
the
statement
was.
this
was
at
the
sentencing
hearing.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
only
say
that
in
this
case,
because
of
the
failure
to
make
that
simple
inquiry
at
the
plead
receiving,
the
government
has
imposed
upon
it
what
may
be
the
subversive
substantial
burden
of
going
through
a
collateral
proceeding
having
to
prove
that
in
fact
there
was
an
understanding
of
the
nature
of
the
charges.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
he
did
fail.
he
did
fail
to
inquire
about
that.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
yes,
yes,
we
do
mr.
justice.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
well,
perhaps
i
should
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
there
are
several
court
of
appeals
cases.perhaps,
i
–-
just
to
be
absolutely
thorough
i
should
rephrase
that
point.
the
question
that
we
say
could
be
raised
on
collateral
attack
is
the
question
whether
in
fact
the
defendant
understood
that
nature
of
the
charge
at
the
time
of
the
plea
not
what
transpired
on
the
record
between
the
judge
and
the
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
--
and
the
defendant.
it's
this
question
of
actual
understanding.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
and
that
information
as
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
--
far
as
the
record
shows.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
think
there
should
be
some
indication
in
the
record.
i
think
it
was
sufficient
here
without
even
some
of
the
colloquy.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
the
crucial
point
being
that
it
is
indicated
that
the
judge
considered
a
presentence
report.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
no,
we
would
suggest
that
sufficiently
implicit
in
the
entry
of
judgment
and
i
think
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
no,
the
judge
did
not
say
i
am
satisfied
or
would
we
suggest
that
the
language
in
the
last
sentence
of
rule
11
was
chosen
advisably.
it
contemplates
an
informal
determination
by
the
use
of
the
words
satisfy
and
that
requirement
is
fulfilled
here.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
under
a
contemporaneous
amendment
as
the
court
knows
of
rule
32
(a),
the
trial
judge
has
told
that
he
may
make
the
presentence
report
available
as
i
have
requested.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
no,
here
was
not
made
available
to
the
defendant.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
that
certainly
is,
it's
not
precluded.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
no.
we
would
suggest
however
that
it
is
not
--
it
should
not
be
required
to
satisfy
the
last
sentence
of
rule
11
that
the
record
support
with
appropriate
evidence
the
determination
of
satisfaction
that
the
trial
judge
makes.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
there
is
very
little,
we
have
to
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
there
is
nothing
in
the
ordinary
sense
of
evidence,
yes.
