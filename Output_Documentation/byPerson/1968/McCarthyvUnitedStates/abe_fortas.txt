justice
abe
fortas
what
is
the
provision
in
rule
11
on
which
you
rely
for
that
last
argument?
justice
abe
fortas
in
determining
that
the
plea
is
made
voluntarily?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
may
i
--
i
hope
this
won't
disturb
the
order
of
your
argument.
i'd
like
to
call
your
attention
of
the
last
sentence
of
rule
11
as
amended.
i
take
it
from
reading
your
brief
that
you,
although
you
referred
of
that
last
sentence,
you
don't
really
rely
on
it.
you
recall
of
the
last
sentence
says
that,
“the
court
shall
not
enter
a
judgment
upon
a
plea
of
guilty
unless
it
is
satisfied
that
there
is
a
factual
basis
for
the
plea.”
now,
what
was
the
date
of
the
entry
of
judgment
upon
the
plea?
justice
abe
fortas
and
at
that
time,
i
think
the
record
shows
that
the
judge
had
before
him
and
had
consulted
the
pre-sentence
report.
justice
abe
fortas
and
at
that
time,
did
he
try
correctly
recall
that
he
referred
to
the
certain
bookkeeping
difficulties
revealed
by
the
presentence
report?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
do
you
argue
that
there
was
no
explicit
finding
however
by
the
court
in
september
of
that
it
is
satisfied
that
there
is
a
factual
basis
for
the
plea?
was
there
such
finding?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
you
do
not
argue
that
the
court
has
to
make
such
an
explicit
finding,
do
you?
i
don't
read
that
in
your
brief.
justice
abe
fortas
why
not?
justice
abe
fortas
you
read
--
you
read
unless
it
is
satisfied
as
referring
to
a
mental
state
which
a
judge
does
not
have
to
make
explicit?
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that,
that
is
the
first
part
of
your
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
what
do
you
think
that
last
sentence
means
and
you
think
that
how
can
it
be
satisfied
if
the
plea
is
justified
without
being
having
some
basis
for
believing
that
the
defendant
did
the
act?
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
but
you
don't
tie
them
as
i
remember
perhaps
i'm
wrong.
you
don't
tie
that
argument
into
this
last
sentence,
do
you?
justice
abe
fortas
no,
i
don't
say
that
critical,
i'm
trying
to
find
out
your
theory
after
all,
i
believe
i'm
correct
in
saying
that
this
is
the
first
time
that
the
amendments
of
rule
11
has
been
before
us.
justice
abe
fortas
and
i've
try
and
i
confess
with
a
little
surprise
that
the
sort
of
lack
of
reliance
on
that
last
sentence
what
i've
take
it
now
from
which
you
have
said
that
you
regarded
as
referring
only
to
a
mental
state
in
the
court
which
did
not
have
to
be
reflected
in
any
finding
or
any
statement
by
the
court
and
i
suppose
that
at
the
time
of
the
entry
of
judgment,
the
court
had
before
it
a
presentence
report
which
did
not
however
make
any
reference
whatever
to
the
particular
crime.
i
suppose
that's
possible,
i'd
seen
precedence
reports
like
that.
now
and
there's
nothing
before
the
court
whatever,
whatever
except
the
indictment,
the
plea
of
guilty
and
the
presentence,
the
investigation
report
that
makes
no
reference
to
the
particular
crime.
now
and
the
court
asked
no
questions
about
the
particular
crime.
now,
either
the
defendant
or
his
counsel
in
your
opinion
is
that,
would
that
satisfy
the
last
sentence
here?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
what,
what
--
i
missed
in
your
brief
any
discussion
of
question
as
to
whether
this
last
sentence
was
or
was
not
satisfied
in
your
case.
justice
abe
fortas
free
--
that's
where
i
read
your
brief
and
so
it
means
that
if
we
don't
agree
with
you
about
the
first
part
of
rule
11
that
there
are
the
court
so
far
as
your
argument
is
concerned.
if
we
don't
agree
with
you
about
the
application
of
the
phrase
in
rule
11
in
this
case
that
is
that
the
court
must
first
address
the
defendant
personally
and
determine
that
pea
is
made
voluntarily,
etcetera.
justice
abe
fortas
i
don't
agree
with
you
about
that
and
your
argument
falls
because
you
treat
the
last
sentence
as
a
mere
appendage
then
you
get
some
support
from
that
i
agree
from
the
reporters
note,
the
advisory
note
but
that
is
--
am
i
correct
about
your
argument?
justice
abe
fortas
why
do
you
think
--
why
do
you
think
the
committee
put
that
sentence
in
the
rules?
justice
abe
fortas
why
is
that
the
judge
can
satisfy
the
last
sentence
says
that
the
judge.
justice
abe
fortas
must
have
been
satisfied
with
one
--
than
that
appeared
just
for
the
language
of
that
sentence.
the
idea
was
to
see
that
the
court
before
sentencing
a
man
was
satisfied
that
he
wasn't
pleading
guilty
because
of
desperation
or
whatever
it
may
be,
wanting
to
put
an
end
on
uncertain
situation
or
whatever,
or
pressure
or
whatnot
that
the
judge
has
to
be
satisfied
that
there's
a
factual
basis
for
the
plea.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
apart
from
what
the
merits
may
be,
i
suppose
the
government's
position
is
that
the
petitioner
having
pleaded
guilty,
it
was
his
responsibility
upon
being
personally
addressed
by
the
court
to
come
forward
with
some
sort
of
showing
that
would
indicate
that
would
give
a
basis
for
a
claim
at
that
time
or
subsequently
that
can
be
done
that
he
did
not
plead
guilty
unknowingly,
isn't
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
the
question
is
whether
it
have
to
be
a
showing
made
at
the
time,
some
showing
made
at
the
time
that
the
prisoner
is
addressed
by
the
judge
and
if
so
what
form
that
has
to
take?
justice
abe
fortas
is
it
or
is
it
not
the
government's
position
whether
raised
collaterally
or
on
direct
appeal
that
that
is
the
time
when
a
showing
has
to
be
made
under
rule
11?
justice
abe
fortas
do
you
believe
it
can
be
made
collateral?
justice
abe
fortas
but
what
you're
saying
to
us
then
comes
down
to
the
proposition
as
i
understand
it
that
there
is
no
evidence
or
nothing
from
which
we
can
rely
in
this
record
to
show
that
the
plea
was
not
voluntarily
and
knowingly
made,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
or
is
it
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
and
also
that
nothing
before
us
to
show
that
the
necessary
element
of
the
crime
that
is
to
say
the
knowing
evasion
of
taxes
was
not
present.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
mr.
springer
that's
--
you
surprise
me.
could
i
ask
you
to
bear
with
me
and
let
me
see
if
we
can
try
and
get
this
straight
in
my
own
mind.
there
are
two
phases
here
chronologically.
there
are
two
faces
under
rule
11.
one,
that
man
pleads
guilty
in
this
case.
then
under
rule
11,
before
the
judge
at
that
time
which
in
this
case
was
july
15,
1966.
at
that
time,
the
judge
may
not
accept
the
plea
of
guilty
without
first
addressing
the
defendant
or
without
determining
that
the
plea
is
made
voluntarily
with
understanding
of
the
nature
of
the
charge
and
the
consequences
of
the
plea.
alright
now,
are
you
with
me?
justice
abe
fortas
alright,
on
july
15,
the
judge
did
address
this
defendant
directly.
right?
justice
abe
fortas
he
did
ask
him
about
his
understanding
of
the
consequences
of
the
plea.
right?
justice
abe
fortas
those
were
the
words
added
strangely
enough
by
the
july,
by
the
amendment
effective
july
1,
1966.
you
have
stated
to
us
however,
that
he
did
not
address
the
defendant
directly
with
respect
to
the
defendant's
understanding
of
the
nature
of
the
charge.
in
so
far
as
the
judge
did
not
ask
the
defendant
what
he
understood
that
the
income
tax
evasion
had
to
be
done
knowingly
in
order
to
constitute
the
offense
charge.
am
i
right?
justice
abe
fortas
you
agree
with
what
i've
said?
justice
abe
fortas
and
you
assert
that
that
question
can
be
raised
on
the
collateral
attack.
justice
abe
fortas
is
there
any
authority
to
that
effect?
now
remember,
we're
not
talking
about
whether
the
prisoner
can
collaterally
attack
that
his
conviction
because
he
did
not
commit
the
crime
knowingly.
we're
talking
only
about
whether
the
prisoner
can
collaterally
attack
his
conviction
because
the
judge
did
not
determine
by
direct
questioning
whether
the
prisoner
understood
the
nature
of
the
charge.
justice
abe
fortas
is
there
any
authority
to
the
effect
that
that
question,
that
narrow
question
of
what
happens
after
plea
of
guilty
and
on
acceptance
of
the
plea
of
guilty
under
rule
11?
is
there
any
authority
to
the
effect
that
that
can
be
attack
collaterally?
justice
abe
fortas
alright.
justice
abe
fortas
let's
leave
that
confusion
where
it
is
and
let's
go
to
the
next
phase.
alright,
that's
what
happens
before
the
judge
or
should
happen
under
rule
11
before
the
judge
accepts
a
plea
of
guilty
under
rule
11
and
those
were
the
events
imperfect
or
whatever
they
may
have
been
that
occurred
here
on
july
15,
1966.
right?
justice
abe
fortas
alright.
then
you
come
to
the
next
phase,
which
is
after
--
which
is
the
sentencing.
and
that
is
the
time
at
which
the
last
sentence
of
rule
11
applies,
is
it
not?
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
when
judgment
is
entered.
and
that
was
september
of
1966
and
rule
11
as
amended
effective
july
1st
states
that
the
court
shall
not
enter
a
judgment
upon
a
plea
of
guilty
unless
it
is
sentence
by
it
that
there
is
a
factual
basis
for
the
plea.
now,
do
you
want
to
tell
this
court,
won't
make
any
comment
to
this
court
as
to
whether
that
sentence
was
satisfied
in
this
case,
remembering
it
does
not
have
to
be
satisfied
on
july
15
if
what
i
have
said
is
correct.
but
it
does
have
to
be
satisfied
by
the
time
the
judgment
is
entered
which
in
this
case
was
september.
justice
abe
fortas
in
the
hearing,
in
the
colloquy
in
september,
according
to
this
record
the
judge
did
refer
to
the
what
he
referred
to
as
more
or
less
deliberately
confused
bookkeeping
of
the
defendant
as
disclosed
by
the
presentence
report.
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
there
is
some
indication
here
that
the
judge
did
have
before
him
some
information
going
to
what
actually
happened
here.
going
to
the
factual
basis
for
the
plea,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
is
it
the
government's
position
at
all
its
--
that
is
essential
that
it
is
essential
to
comply
with
that
last
sentence,
there
be
some
indication
of
some
sort
on
the
record
that
the
court
did
look
into
and
was
satisfied
that
there
is
a
factual
basis
for
the
plea.
or
do
you
say
that
that
last
sentence
doesn't
mean
anything
of
the
sort?
justice
abe
fortas
do
you
think
there
should
be
some
indication
but
that
the
indication
here
is
enough?
justice
abe
fortas
alright
and
you
say
that
the
court
doesn't
have
to
enter
anything
on
the
record
to
the
effect
that
it
is
satisfied
that
there
was
a
factual
basis
for
the
plea.
justice
abe
fortas
there
was
no
such
--
nothing
on
the
record
to
in
this
case
to
that
effect.
justice
abe
fortas
what
is
the
provision
in
rule
11
on
which
you
rely
for
that
last
argument?
justice
abe
fortas
in
determining
that
the
plea
is
made
voluntarily?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
may
i
--
i
hope
this
won't
disturb
the
order
of
your
argument.
i'd
like
to
call
your
attention
of
the
last
sentence
of
rule
11
as
amended.
i
take
it
from
reading
your
brief
that
you,
although
you
referred
of
that
last
sentence,
you
don't
really
rely
on
it.
you
recall
of
the
last
sentence
says
that,
“the

enter
a
judgment
upon
a
plea
of
guilty
unless
it
is
satisfied
that
there
is

basis
for
the
plea.”
now,
what
was
the
date
of
the
entry
of
judgment
upon
the
plea?
justice
abe
fortas
and
at
that
time,
i
think
the
record
shows
that
the
judge
had
before
him
and
had

the
pre-sentence

you
do
not

that
the
court
has
to
make
such
an

do
you?
i
don't
read
that
in
your

justice
abe
fortas
why
not?
justice
abe
fortas
you
read
--
you
read
unless
it
is
satisfied
as
referring
to
a
mental
state
which
a
judge
does
not
have
to
make

justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that,
that
is
the
first

of
your

justice
abe
fortas

what
do

that
i
agree
from
the
reporters
note,
the
advisory
note
but
that
is
--
am
i
correct
about
your
argument?
justice
abe
fortas
why
do
you
think
--
why
do
you
think
the
committee
put
that
sentence
in
the
rules?
justice
abe
fortas
why
is
that
the
judge
can
satisfy
the
last
sentence
says
that
the
judge.
justice
abe
fortas
must
have
been
satisfied
with
one
--
than
that
appeared
just
for
the
language
of
that
sentence.
the
idea
was
to
see
that
the
court
before
sentencing
a
man
was
satisfied
that
he
wasn't
pleading
guilty
because
of
desperation
or
whatever
it
may
be,
wanting
to
put
an
end
on
uncertain
situation
or
whatever,
or
pressure
or
whatnot
that
the
judge
has
to
be
satisfied
that
there's
a
factual
basis
for
the
plea.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
apart
from
what
the
merits
may
be,
i
suppose
the
government's
position
is
that
the
petitioner
having
pleaded
guilty,
it
was
his
responsibility
upon
being
personally
addressed
by
the
court
to
come
forward
with
some
sort
of
showing
that
would
indicate
that
would
give
a
basis
for
a
claim
at
that
time
or
subsequently
that
can
be
done
that
he
did
not
plead
guilty
unknowingly,
isn't
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
the
question
is
whether
it
have
to
be
a
showing
made
at
the
time,
some
showing
made
at
the
time
that
the
prisoner
is
addressed
by
the
judge
and
if
so
what
form
that
has
to
take?
justice
abe
fortas
is
it
or
is
it
not
the
government's
position
whether
raised
collaterally
or
on
direct
appeal
that
that
is
the
time
when
a
showing
has
to
be
made
under
rule
11?
justice
abe
fortas
do
you
believe
it
can
be
made
collateral?
justice
abe
fortas
but
what
you're
saying
to
us
then
comes
down
to
the
proposition
as
i
understand
it
that
there
is
no
evidence
or
nothing
from
which
we
can
rely
in
this
record
to
show
that
the
plea
was
not
voluntarily
and
knowingly
made,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
or
is
it
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
and
also
that
nothing
before
us
to
show
that
the
necessary
element
of
the
crime
that
is
to
say
the
knowing
evasion
of
taxes
was
not
present.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
mr.
springer
that's
--
you
surprise
me.
could
i
ask
you
to
bear
with
me
and
let
me
see
if
we
can
try
and
get
this
straight
in
my
own
mind.
there
are
two
phases
here
chronologically.
there
are
two
faces
under
rule
11.
one,
that
man
pleads
guilty
in
this
case.
then
under
rule
11,
before
the
judge
at
that
time
which
in
this
case
was
july
15,
1966.
at
that
time,
the
judge
may
not
accept
the
plea
of
guilty
without
first
addressing
the
defendant
or
without
determining
that
the
plea
is
made
voluntarily
with
understanding
of
the
nature
of
the
charge
and
the
consequences
of
the
plea.
alright
now,
are
you
with
me?
justice
abe
fortas
alright,
on
july
15,
the
judge
did
address
this
defendant
directly.
right?
justice
abe
fortas
he
did
ask
him
about
his
understanding
of
the
consequences
of
the
plea.
right?
justice
abe
fortas
those
were
the
words
added
strangely
enough
by
the
july,
by
the
amendment
effective
july
1,
1966.
you
have
stated
to
us
however,
that
he
did
not
address
the
defendant
directly
with
respect
to
the
defendant's
understanding
of
the
nature
of
the
charge.
in
so
far
as
the
judge
did
not
ask
the
defendant
what
he
understood
that
the
income
tax
evasion
had
to
be
done
knowingly
in
order
to
constitute
the
offense
charge.
am
i
right?
justice
abe
fortas
you
agree
with
what
i've
said?
justice
abe
fortas
and
you
assert
that
that
question
can
be
raised
on
the
collateral
attack.
justice
abe
fortas
is
there
any
authority
to
that
effect?
now
remember,
we're
not
talking
about
whether
the
prisoner
can
collaterally
attack
that
his
conviction
because
he
did
not
commit
the
crime
knowingly.
we're
talking
only
about
whether
the
prisoner
can
collaterally
attack
his
conviction
because
the
judge
did
not
determine
by
direct
questioning
whether
the
prisoner
understood
the
nature
of
the
charge.
justice
abe
fortas
is
there
any
authority
to
the
effect
that
that
question,
that
narrow
question
of
what
happens
after
plea
of
guilty
and
on
acceptance
of
the
plea
of
guilty
under
rule
11?
is
there
any
authority
to
the
effect
that
that
can
be
attack
collaterally?
justice
abe
fortas
alright.
justice
abe
fortas
let's
leave
that
confusion
where
it
is
and
let's
go
to
the
next
phase.
alright,
that's
what
happens
before
the
judge
or
should
happen
under
rule
11
before
the
judge
accepts
a
plea
of
guilty
under
rule
11
and
those
were
the
events
imperfect
or
whatever
they
may
have
been
that
occurred
here
on
july
15,
1966.
right?
justice
abe
fortas
alright.
then
you
come
to
the
next
phase,
which
is
after
--
which
is
the
sentencing.
and
that
is
the
time
at
which
the
last
sentence
of
rule
11
applies,
is
it
not?
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
when
judgment
is
entered.
and
that
was
september
of
1966
and
rule
11
as
amended
effective
july
1st
states
that
the
court
shall
not
enter
a
judgment
upon
a
plea
of
guilty
unless
it
is
sentence
by
it
that
there
is
a
factual
basis
for
the
plea.
now,
do
you
want
to
tell
this
court,
won't
make
any
comment
to
this
court
as
to
whether
that
sentence
was
satisfied
in
this
case,
remembering
it
does
not
have
to
be
satisfied
on
july
15
if
what
i
have
said
is
correct.
but
it
does
have
to
be
satisfied
by
the
time
the
judgment
is
entered
which
in
this
case
was
september.
justice
abe
fortas
in
the
hearing,
in
the
colloquy
in
september,
according
to
this
record
the
judge
did
refer
to
the
what
he
referred
to
as
more
or
less
deliberately
confused
bookkeeping
of
the
defendant
as
disclosed
by
the
presentence
report.
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
there
is
some
indication
here
that
the
judge
did
have
before
him
some
information
going
to
what
actually
happened
here.
going
to
the
factual
basis
for
the
plea,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
is
it
the
government's
position
at
all
its
--
that
is
essential
that
it
is
essential
to
comply
with
that
last
sentence,
there
be
some
indication
of
some
sort
on
the
record
that
the
court
did
look
into
and
was
satisfied
that
there
is
a
factual
basis
for
the
plea.
or
do
you
say
that
that
last
sentence
doesn't
mean
anything
of
the
sort?
justice
abe
fortas
do
you
think
there
should
be
some
indication
but
that
the
indication
here
is
enough?
justice
abe
fortas
alright
and
you
say
that
the
court
doesn't
have
to
enter
anything
on
the
record
to
the
effect
that
it
is
satisfied
that
there
was
a
factual
basis
for
the
plea.
justice
abe
fortas
there
was
no
such
--
nothing
on
the
record
to
in
this
case
to
that
effect.
