are
those

or
not?
justice
potter
stewart
still
of
course,
you're
still
dealing
with
opinions
though
not
consequently
truly
the
facts?
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
opinion
evidence.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
the
opinion
on
both
sides
now
is
that
these
notes
were
not
written
by
the
petitioner
contrary
to
the
opinion
evidence
while
on
the
original
trial
there
was
a
conflict
in
the
opinion
evidence,
wasn't
there?
justice
potter
stewart
there
was
just
a
denial
on
his
part?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
was
before
the
jury
at
the
original
trial.
justice
potter
stewart
the
petitioner
was
in
the
penitentiary
prior
to
trial,
are
they
not?
justice
potter
stewart
county
jail?
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
still
the
law
in
iowa,
mr.
carlson?
justice
potter
stewart
so
far
as
the
iowa
courts
are
concerned?
but
i
gather
that
the
eighth
circuit
has
recently
held
that
it
violates
the
united
states
constitution?
justice
potter
stewart
what
time
of
day
or
night?
it
was
night
time,
was
it?
justice
potter
stewart
in
may.
justice
potter
stewart
it
could
have
been
dawn.
justice
potter
stewart
does
is
--
it
also
appears,
doesn't
it
that
he
never
have
been
in
this
clarinda
institute
for
the
insane.
justice
potter
stewart
and
this
is
the
sheriff's
office
that
had
control
of
custody
of
the
people
in
the
jail.
is
that
also
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
what
was
he
in
jail
for?
drunkenness?
public
drunkenness?
justice
potter
stewart
and
he
was
released
--
justice
potter
stewart
just
few
days
before
this
fellow
--
before
the
petitioner
of
this
case
was
convicted
and
sentenced
to
life
imprisonment.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
orsucci
has
long
since
deceased,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
these
proceedings
were
not
initiated
by
the
petitioner
until
after
mr.
orsucci
died,
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
but
did
--
i
understand
i
missed
what
you
said
at
the
beginning.
you
said
this
man
escaped
--
try
to
escape,
the
petitioner?
justice
potter
stewart
1953.
justice
potter
stewart
this
was
a
--
what
were
the
circumstances
of
this
murder?
it
was
a
killing
of
a
police
captain?
justice
potter
stewart
what,
in
the
commission
of
a
felony
or
what?
justice
potter
stewart
but
he
died.
justice
potter
stewart
so,
a
second-degree
verdict
would
appear
offhand
to
be
something
of
a
compromise
verdict,
wouldn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
who
put
on
the
testimony
in
habeas
hearing
of
the
state
expert
or
was
it
ever
in
the
case?
justice
potter
stewart
the
state's
counsel?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
state's
expert
never
testified?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
is
the
state
bound
by
--
is
the
state
--
if
the
state
had
put
the
expert
on
the
stand,
would
the
state
be
bound
by
his
testimony
or
not?
justice
potter
stewart
your
basic
point
is
that
even
accepting
all
these,
there
was
no
knowing
use
of
false
testimony,
no
false
evidence?
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
unwise
but
constitutional?
justice
potter
stewart
he
was
told
it
was
false
in
open
court
so
as
the
jury
told
them
it's
false.
justice
potter
stewart
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
he
thought
it
was
false
and
certainly
does
it
mean
that
he
knew
it
was
false.
