mr.

justice

r.
white
this
was
35
years
ago?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
got
life
sentence?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
gather
life
sentence
like
(inaudible).
justice
byron
r.
white
even
the
defendant
(inaudible)
may
advise
for
15
years.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
gather
quite
that
they'll
say
in
iowa,
life
is
almost
(inaudible).
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
had
he
raised
these
questions
in
other
procedures
he
elevated?
justice
byron
r.
white
when
did
--
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
i
suppose
--
that
was
15
years
i
believe.
justice
byron
r.
white
thank
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
a
picture,
unavailable,
would
he?
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
not
your
submission
though
that
the
--
said
this
county
was
160
miles
when
the
file
came?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
it
also
suggest
that
the
prosecutor,
i
take
it,
is
an
official
of
the
prior
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
anyone
--
local
sheriff
of
that
county
knew
anything
of
this
assuming
now
what
are
these
people?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
to
that
extent,
it's
a
question
issue
we
have.
this
would
rather
be
in
a
larger
with
possible
amount
of
this
situation
which
we
have
found
that
no
trial
was
required
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
far
the
case
is
i
think
am
i
correct?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
this
area,
knowing
some
question
of
evidence
have
involved
fact
situation
that
were
under
the
prosecutor
itself
or
someone
related
officially
to
him
like
a
local
police
officer
or
something
who
was
responsible
for
his
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
again,
to
that
extent
your
submission
that
was
require
a
logical
principle
so
that
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
was
thinking,
if
you
prevail,
this
man
will
end
up
to
be
tried.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
thought
you
said
if
somebody
believes.
justice
byron

incidentally,
with
direct
trying
