mr.
william
a.
claerhout
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
so
that
the
court
will
have
a
better
appreciation
of
the
rather
complicated
rules
of
law
here
involved,
i
would
like
to
very
briefly
recount
the
basic
facts
involved
in
the
case.
it
began
about
5:30
in
the
morning
on
may
27,
1934
when
a
burlington,
iowa
policeman
was
shot
while
investigating
a
reported
burglary.
he
later
died
of
shotgun
wounds
without
making
an
identification
of
his
assailant.
however,
two
witnesses
near
the
scene
heard
shots
and
saw
two
people
running
from
the
scene.
one
of
the
two
persons,
these
two
witnesses
identified
very
positively
was
the
petitioner
in
this
case.
they
saw
--
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
i
don't
know
your
honor
whether
or
not
it
was
light
or
dark
but
it
was
established
there
was
about
5:30
or
6:00
in
the
morning
in
may.
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
so
i
would
--
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
--
speculate
it
would
be
light
at
that
time.
nevertheless,
the
petitioner
who
was
seen
by
these
two
witnesses
walking
briskly
from
the
scene
after
the
shots,
he
was
seen
in
the
company
of
another
man.
the
two
got
into
a
black
v8
ford
and
drove
away.
the
state
also
presented
testimony
showing
the
petitioner
a
few
miles
east
of
burlington
in
illinois,
the
friday
night
before
the
sunday
morning.
at
that
time,
he
also
had
a
shotgun.
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
the
sunday,
before
the
sunday
morning,
36
hours
or
so,
your
honor.
although
no
shotgun
was
ever
found,
the
ford
v8
was
identified
at
the
residence
of
mr.
johnson
in
des
moines
when
he
was
arrested.
he
was
identified
by
the
witnesses
who
had
seen
it
in
burlington.
now,
although
mr.
johnson
did
not
take
the
witness
stand,
he
did
present
at
least
six
witnesses
from
des
moines
who
claimed
that
he
was
in
des
moines
at
the
time
when
it
would
have
been
impossible
for
him
to
also
have
been
in
burlington
a
165
miles
away
at
the
time
of
the
murder.
thus,
the
alibi
proposition
is
raised.
now,
there
are
three
issues
involved
here
and
i
think
--
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
yes,
your
honor,
the
state
was
a
very
vigorous
trial
on
both
sides
and
those
witnesses
were
attacked
vigorously
of
course
on
their
association
with
the
petitioner.
one
was
i
believe
his
mother
and
his
brother
was
involved
and
his
father.
yes,
they
were
attacked.
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
i
don't
know
that
the
record
shows
that
there
are
close
associates,
perhaps
they
knew
each
other,
i
believe
it
was
as
far
as
they
went.
well
the
three
issues
here
involved
and
i
think
are
very
crucial
issues
that
had
been
before
this
court
before
and
i
will
attempt
to
spend
at
least
short
of
10
minutes
on
each
of
them.
the
first
is
the
suppression
of
witness
orsucci.
now
the
district
court
below
did
in
fact
find
that
mr.
thomas
orsucci,
one
of
the
13
or
14
requested
witnesses
was
in
fact
in
the
polk
county
jail
in
des
moines,
iowa
and
not
in
the
clarinda
institute
for
the
insane
as
the
deputy
sheriff
had
written
on
the
subpoena
return.
now,
this
we
do
not
dispute.
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
i
believe
that
as
a
fair
result
of
district
court,
didn't
find
some.
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
the
people
in
the
polk
county
jail,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
i
believe
it
was
something
of
that
nature.
drunkenness,
omd
or
something.
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
he
was
released.
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
i
believe
it
was
about
december
8.
it
was
within
the
vicinity
at
the
time
when
the
conviction
was
handed
on
us.
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
i
--
no,
your
honor.
i
don't
believe
he
has.
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
pardon
me?
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
i
understand
from
my
predecessors
on
this
case
and
of
course
there
had
been
a
number
of
it
the
immediate
way.
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
that
the
assistant
sheriff,
the
one
that
actually
filled
out
the
return,
his
name
i
believe
was
kuhns
was
deceased
sometime
ago,
yes,
in
other
words,
before
the
time
when
the
matter
actually
came
up
in
the
federal
district
court
for
hearing.
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
i'm
not
sure
whether
or
not
your
honor
that
particular
sheriff
testified.
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
i
don't
recall.
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
he,
your
honor,
died
in
1965.
a
short
time
before
this
matter
finally
made
it
to
the
hearing
stage
at
federal
court.
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
there
were
proceedings
attempted
in
the
federal
district
court
as
early
as
1948
or
1949.
about
the
time
that
petitioner
obtained
an
affidavit
from
mr.
orsucci.
however,
no
hearing
was
held
until
after
he
deceased.
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
i
don't
believe
your
honor
that
a
hearing
was
specifically
requested
on
your
association.
many
issues
--
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
yes,
your
honor.
there
are
many,
many
issues
before
the
court
and
i
believe
that
was
one
of
them.
if
i
may,
the
rule
we
think
is
entirely
applicable
here
and
were
not
contesting
any
of
this
court's
rules.
it's
in
brady
versus
maryland
and
i
quote
from
373
u.s.
page
87,
“the
suppression
by
the
prosecution
of
evidence
favorable
to
an
accused
upon
request
violates
due
process
where
the
evidence
is
material
either
to
guilt
or
punishment
irrespective
of
good
faith
or
bad
faith
of
the
prosecution.”
but
we
submit
that
the
petitioner
has
freely
admitted
the
purpose
for
which
mr.
orsucci
was
going
to
be
used.
that
is,
he
was
going
to
be
used
to
impeach
one
of
the
two
eyewitnesses
of
the
flight
of
the
two
people
from
the
scene
of
the
murder.
mr.
orsucci
was
not
going
to
be
used
to
say
that
mr.
johnson
was
not
the
one
but
he
was
going
to
be
used
to
impeach
one
of
those
witnesses
who
had
a
previously
identified
mr.
orsucci
as
being
the
partner
of
mr.
johnson.
now,
we
think
that
his
testimony
going
by
what
the
petitioner
admits.
it
was
going
to
be,
was
probably
not
favorable
to
his
case
and
secondly,
we
don't
think
and
we
completely
agree
with
all
the
federal
courts
below
that
even
if
this
testimony
have
been
presented
it
would
have
not
--
would
not
have
been
material
to
guilt
or
punishment.
the
impeachment
would
not
have
affected
the
very
sure
testimony
of
the
two
witnesses
as
to
the
petition.
it
would
have
only
affected
the
unsureness
of
one
of
the
witnesses.
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
well,
your
honor,
because
it
was
said
in
brady
that
irrespective
of
good
faith
or
bad
faith
of
prosecution,
i
think
the
handwriting
is
on
the
wall,
that
perhaps
that's
sure.
but
i
must
call
attention
to
the
court
that
the
eighth
circuit
did
not
reach
that
position
because
it
found
that
the
testimony
would
have
not
have
been
material
so
i
don't
think
this
court
really
has
to
go
--
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
i
think
the
evidence
would
have
to
be
found
material
before
we
could
arrive
to
that
question.
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
yes.
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
well
your
honor,
mr.
chief
justice
i
think
that
it
would
not
and
i
take
this
position
based
upon
the
peculiar
facts
of
this
case.
the
two
attorneys
that
represented
the
defendant
at
that
trial
or
have
been
found
to
be
very
able
review
of
the
trial
transcript
record
shows
that
they
were
very
vigorous.
they
tried
very
hard
to
shake
these
two
witnesses
as
to
their
identification
of
the
petitioner
and
they
were
steadfast.
i
believe
this
further
because
i
think
the
defense
used
this
many
witnesses
or
several
witnesses
ahead
as
an
alibi.
i
think
that
the
impeachment
would
have
merely
amounted
to
one
more
alibi
witness.
and
therefore,
i
do
not
think
i
agree
with
the
court
of
appeals
below
that
even
if
that
testimony
had
been
presented
it
would
have
not
impeached
the
one
witness
little
own
both.
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
no,
your
honor
for
this
reason.
i
believe
that
it
would
have
made
states
case
perhaps
even
stronger
if
the
witness
would
have
said
true,
i
am
unsure
about
the
one
man
but
yet
i'm
sure
about
the
defendant.
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
no.
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
mr.
chief
justice,
only
one
of
the
witnesses
i
believe
was
going
to
be
impeached
of
course.
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
yes.
no,
i
quite
candidly
think
that
mr.
orsucci's
involvement
in
this
case
that
the
possibility
that
maybe
he
was
the
other
witness
would
have
been
looked
upon
by
the
jury
and
is
more
favorable
to
the
state
perhaps
than
to
the
defendant.
i
don't
think
impeachment
of
that
witness
could
have
been
obtained.
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
no,
sir.
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
mr.
justice
--
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
well,
mr.
justice,
this
is
exactly
our
point
i
believe.
the
jury
in
1934
was
present
and
they
have
some
43
witnesses
i
believe
to
look
at.
they
disbelieve
obviously
petitioner's
witnesses
because
if
they
would
have,
they
would
have
found
him
not
guilty.
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
mr.
justice,
i
think
we
must
rely
upon
what
petitioner
says.
he
would
have
used
that
one
as
far.
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
very
much
so.
i
--
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
well,
not
with
any
reasonable
probability.
i
think
it
is
subject
to
some
speculation.
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
i
might
add
that
much
has
been
made
about
if
whether
or
not
this
particular
witness
would
have
been
favorable.
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
an
affidavit
was
obtained
in
1949
from
this
mr.
orsucci
saying
that
he
had
evidence
relevant
to
the
defense.
nothing
further
was
ever
done
on
that,
apparently,
although
of
course
as
we've
already
seen
the
petitioner
did
try
to
get
a
hearing
in
federal
court.
he
did
manage
in
1961,
three
or
four
years
before
mr.
orsucci
died.
he
did
manage
to
get
the
court
to
direct
a
deposition
be
taken
of
another
witness
mr.
ruggles
on
a
perjury
question.
well,
mr.
ruggles
lived
in
california
and
by
the
petitioner's
own
admission
in
the
habeas
corpus
hearing
when
he
finally
did
get
it.
he
spent
almost
$2,000.00
obtaining
this
particular
deposition
while
mr.
orsucci
was
not
in
california
but
in
des
moines
and
he
admitted
that
his
brother
often
talked
with
mr.
orsucci.
yet,
no
testimony
was
ever
perpetuated
from
this,
what
is
claim
now,
key
important
witness,
mr.
orsucci.
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
i
don't
believe
i
understand.
he
could
have
taken
the
deposition
of
mr.
orsucci
in
des
moines
i
think
if
he
could
take
the
deposition
of
mr.
ruggles
in
california
which
--
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
well,
i
don't
quite
know
the
answer
to
that
mr.
chief
justice
but
i
do
know
that
in
this
court,
or
rather
in
the
federal
district
court,
the
judge
did
order
a
deposition
to
be
taken
in
1961
of
this
mr.
ruggles
and
i
--
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
well,
i
--
my
point
is
that
if
this
could
have
been
done
with
regard
to
mr.
ruggles
under
federal
law,
i
believe
that
because
at
that
time
the
petitioner's
attorney
i
believe
was
from
des
moines.
his
brother
was
there
and
so
as
mr.
orsucci
that
could
have
been
accomplished
relatively
easily
compared
with
the
other.
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
i,
quite
honestly
your
honor,
i
don't
know.
one
other
point
i'll
raise
very
quickly
and
then
go
on
to
the
next.
it
is
shown
in
the
habeas
corpus
district
court
hearing
that
the
petitioner
was
in
fact
out
of
prison
for
two
and
a
half
or
three
years.
it
appears
that
he
walked
away
from
a
prison
farm
in
1953
and
was
later
recaptured
in
1956
in
detroit
having
spent
most
of
his
time
in
canada.
we
would
thus
submit
that
again
if
mr.
orsucci
had
been
as
important
a
witness
as
he
is
now
claimed,
perhaps
the
petitioner
might
have
done
something
during
that
time.
and
this
also
might
answer
the
question
which
was
raised
yesterday
about
the
parole.
i
think
the
question
is
not
why
parole
has
not
been
granted
but
why
the
governor
of
the
state
was
able
to
commute
the
sentence
has
not
commuted
the
sentence?
perhaps,
that
had
something
to
do
with
once
the
sentence
is
commuted
of
course
to
a
term
of
years
then
parole
could
thereafter
be
granted.
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
the
petitioner
walked
away
from
a
prison
farm
in
1953.
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
he
admitted
this
during
his
testimony
before
the
federal
district
court.
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
a
reported
burglary
had
brought
forth
several
burlington
policemen.
they
surrounded
the
store
that
was
reported
being
burglarized
and
when
this
captain
sauer
went
to
one
side
or
to
the
back
of
the
store,
shots
were
heard
and
he
was
found
wounded
with
shotgun
wounds.
he
later
died.
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
but
he
did
not
testify
or
of
course
speak
who
was
--
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
it
was
the
least
of
the
three
convictions
offered
to
the
jury
and
they
took
that
one,
yes.
the
false
evidence
which
has
claimed
here
has
to
do
with
the
notes
which
were
intercepted
by
other
prisoners
presented
to
prison
official
and
made
their
halfway
into
the
hands
of
the
prosecutor.
now,
this
court's
decision
in
miller
versus
pate,
and
that
was
bloody
shorts
case
was
completely
avoided
by
the
petitioner
in
his
brief
here
until
reply.
but
we
think
the
rule
is
directly
on
point
that
was
used
by
the
eighth
circuit
and
that
is
this
and
i
quote
from
386
u.s.
page
7.
“the
fourteenth
amendment
cannot
tolerate
a
state
criminal
conviction
obtained
by
the
knowing
use
of
false
evidence.”
well,
there
are
two
critical
points
which
lead
us
to
believe
that
that
particular
rule
does
not
require
a
finding
of
violation
of
due
process
here.
first
of
all,
the
falsity
of
the
notes
is
still
simply
a
matter
of
opinion.
secondly,
regardless
of
what
is
said
today,
the
notes
were
before
the
jury
in
all
their
ramifications.
the
witnesses
for
both
sides
testified.
it
was
before
the
jury
that
perhaps
they
were
forged.
a
mr.
yates,
a
defense
witness
got
up
and
gave
very
clear
testimony
that
he
did
not
think
the
petitioner
had
written
the
notes.
furthermore,
the
court
gave
a
very
clear
instruction
telling
the
jury
that
this
sort
of
thing
and
one
can
imagine
it
might
have
even
more
true
in
1934,
that
this
sort
of
evidence
was
the
lowest
form
of
evidence.
so,
we
believe
that
the
jury
was
completely
aware
of
the
circumstances
surrounding
these
notes
that
it
was
a
jury
determination
to
be
made
then
and
the
jury's
decision
we
are
sure
even
if
there
had
been
the
expert
testimony
available
today
would
have
been
relatively
the
same
as
was
then.
we
don't
know
whether
the
jury
found
they
were
false
or
not.
but
i
do
think
that
their
weight
was
entirely
decimated
by
the
instruction
and
by
the
able
objections
the
able
other
witnesses
presented
by
the
defense
on
this
particular
subject.
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
the
expert
testimony
in
the
hearing
was
presented
by
the
petitioner.
the
state
also
had
expert
opinion
but
i
don't
recall
that
the
expert
was
there
however,
it
was
admitted
at
the
hearing
that
the
state
expert
had
looked
at
the
notes
and
had
concluded
the
same
as
the
expert
before
the
petitioner
in
1965,
i
believe
it
was.
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
to
my
last
knowledge
which
was
years
so
ago,
he
was
your
honor.
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
well,
based
upon
what
the
state
expert
said
and
based
on
the
lapse
and
years,
quite
frankly
i
don't
know
why
they
didn't
use
mr.
foxen
again,
but
i
think
it
was
admitted
by
the
state
at
that
hearing
that
the
state
expert
had
concluded
the
same
as
the
petitioner's
expert.
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
no,
your
honor
and
i
think
this
is
a
good
point
which
has
been
raised
here.
the
return
to
in
order
to
show
cause
i
believe
it
was,
the
state
said
based
upon
the
testimony,
it
would
appear
that
the
notes
were
wrongfully
admitted.
however,
we
contend
now
that
this
was
not
an
admission
of
falsity
but
only
the
reasonable
conclusion
that
notes
or
rather
the
expert's
opinion
in
1965
was
different
than
it
was
in
1934
and
there's
no
showing
or
no
hand
even
that
the
1934
examination
was
fraudulent
in
anyway.
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
i
believe
it
was
merely
stated
by
counsel
at
the
end
of
the
hearing
following
--
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
i
don't
believe
he
did
testify,
no
sir.
but
it
was
stated
that
if
he
did,
he
would
testify
relatively
the
same.
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
well,
no
mr.
justice.
i
don't
think
so
because
i
think
this
is
a
jury
question.
and
i
think
that
in
1965,
it
would
be
entirely
improper
based
merely
upon
expert
testimony
or
the
state
to
usurp
the
jury
function
and
the
state
beyond
what
the
jury
had
in
1934
that
these
notes
were
false.
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
yes,
sir.
this
was
the
letter
that
i
believe
i
refer
to.
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
yes,
there's
no
question
about
that.
now
the
--
in
conclusion
on
that
point,
though
we
think
that
the
petitioner
received
due
process
by
protection
of
the
jury
and
we
think
that
this
would
be
the
same
in
1968,
as
it
was
in
1934.
finally,
the
alibi
instruction
--
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
i
think
mr.
chief
justice
based
on
expert
opinion,
this
is
all
we
have
to
go
on,
yes.
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
well,
if
this
is
considered
an
admission,
i
don't
think
the
state
can
admit
to
such
a
thing
on
mere
expert
opinion.
i
think
it
ought
to
be
more.
but
even
if
it
is
admitted
that
this
--
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
i
think
if
the
man
who
actually
authored
the
notes
stepped
forward
and
said
i
did
those,
not
the
petitioner,
i
think
the
state
would
then
be
in
the
position
that
they
would
have
to
admit
that
they
were
not.
what
it's
doing
here
by
if
it
were
to
admit
as
taking
the
jury
function.
but
the
point
is
mr.
chief
justice,
the
jury
was
well
informed
of
all
these.
we
think
everything
short
of
expert
opinion
to
the
contrary
in
1934.
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
no
knowing
use
by
the
prosecutor
or
anyone
else
who
state.
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
i
think
so.
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
i
think
this
is
a
reasonable
conclusion,
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
if
they
were
believed.
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
no,
i
say
they
probably
were
not
believed
in
1934
because
of
the
strong
case
the
defense
took
against
them
even
presenting
a
witness
who
claimed
that
the
petitioner
had
not
written
and
that
he
thought
that
they
had
been
forged.
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
this
is
true
but
again
i
think
the
court's
instruction
to
the
jury
reduced
their
credibility
greatly
by
saying
these
are
the
lowest
form
of
evidence
and
the
jury
should
take
great
care
in
looking
at
it.
finally,
on
the
alibi
issue,
there
are
three
positions
involved.
one,
of
the
majority
of
the
iowa
supreme
court,
one
of
the
eighth
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
overruling
stump,
and
then
there
is
an
intermediate
position.
the
three
positions
are
unwise
instruction
and
unconstitutional.
the
other
is
unwise
but
not
unconstitutional,
and
the
third
is
wise
and
constitutional.
we
submit
that
the
medial
--
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
yes,
sir,
three
levels
i
think
the
stump
versus
bennett
opinion
by
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
the
third
one
your
honors,
the
view,
the
present
view
of
the
majority
of
the
iowa
supreme
court.
we
submit
that
chief
judge
van
oosterhoout's
opinion
below
and
his
dissent
in
the
stump
versus
bennett
case
are
indeed
the
wisest
of
all
positions.
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
i
think
the
handwriting
is
on
the
wall,
even
before
the
iowa
supreme
court
after
reading
their
carter
case
that
perhaps
it's
not
the
best
but
wouldn't
go
so
far
as
to
say
it's
unconstitutional
for
the
reasons
of
course
set
forth
in
our
brief
and
for
the
same
reasons
this
court
found
the
--
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
for
the
same
reasons
this
court
found
the
insanity
instruction
which
was
required
to
be
proven
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt
was
not
violative
of
due
process
in
leland
versus
oregon.
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
the
petitioner
i
understand
was
born
in
1905.
thank
you.
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
so
that
the
court
will
have
a
better
appreciation
of
the
rather
complicated
rules
of
law
here
involved,
i
would
like
to
very
briefly
recount
the
basic
facts
involved
in
the
case.
it
began
about
5:30
in
the
morning
on
may
27,
1934
when
a
burlington,
iowa
policeman
was
shot
while
investigating
a
reported
burglary.
he
later
died
of
shotgun
wounds
without
making
an
identification
of
his
assailant.
however,
two
witnesses
near
the
scene
heard
shots
and
saw
two
people
running
from
the
scene.
one
of
the
two
persons,
these
two
witnesses
identified
very
positively
was
the
petitioner
in
this
case.
they
saw
--
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
i
don't
know
your
honor
whether
or
not
it
was
light
or
dark
but
it
was
established
there
was
about
5:30
or
6:00
in
the
morning
in
may.
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
so
i
would
--
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
--
speculate
it
would
be
light
at
that
time.
nevertheless,
the
petitioner
who
was
seen
by
these
two
witnesses
walking
briskly
from
the
scene
after
the
shots,
he
was
seen
in
the
company
of
another
man.
the
two
got
into
a
black
v8
ford
and
drove
away.
the
state
also
presented
testimony
showing
the
petitioner
a
few
miles
east
of
burlington
in
illinois,
the
friday
night
before
the
sunday
morning.
at
that
time,
he
also
had
a
shotgun.
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
the
sunday,
before
the
sunday
morning,
36
hours
or
so,
your
honor.
although
no
shotgun
was
ever
found,
the
ford
v8
was
identified
at
the
residence
of
mr.
johnson
in
des
moines
when
he
was
arrested.
he
was
identified
by
the
witnesses
who
had
seen
it
in
burlington.
now,
although
mr.
johnson
did
not
take
the
witness
stand,
he
did
present
at
least
six
witnesses
from
des
moines
who
claimed
that
he
was
in
des
moines
at
the
time
when
it
would
have
been
impossible
for
him
to
also
have
been
in
burlington
a
165
miles
away
at
the
time
of
the
murder.
thus,
the
alibi
proposition
is
raised.
now,
there
are
three
issues
involved
here
and
i
think
--
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
yes,
your
honor,
the
state
was
a
very
vigorous
trial
on
both
sides
and
those
witnesses
were
attacked
vigorously
of
course
on
their
association
with
the
petitioner.
one
was
i
believe
his
mother
and
his
brother
was
involved
and
his
father.
yes,
they
were
attacked.
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
i
don't
know
that
the
record
shows
that
there
are
close
associates,
perhaps
they
knew
each
other,
i
believe
it
was
as
far
as
they
went.
well
the
three
issues
here
involved
and
i
think
are
very
crucial
issues
that
had
been
before
this
court
before
and
i
will
attempt
to
spend
at
least
short
of
10
minutes
on
each
of
them.
the
first
is
the
suppression
of
witness
orsucci.
now
the
district
court
below
did
in
fact
find
that
mr.
thomas
orsucci,
one
of
the
13
or
14
requested
witnesses
was
in
fact
in
the
polk
county
jail
in
des
moines,
iowa
and
not
in
the
clarinda
institute
for
the
insane
as
the
deputy
sheriff
had
written
on
the
subpoena
return.
now,
this
we
do
not
dispute.
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
i
believe
that
as
a
fair
result
of
district
court,
didn't
find
some.
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
the
people
in
the
polk
county
jail,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
i
believe
it
was
something
of
that
nature.
drunkenness,
omd
or
something.
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
he
was
released.
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
i
believe
it
was
about
december
8.
it
was
within
the
vicinity
at
the
time
when
the
conviction
was
handed
on
us.
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
i
--
no,
your
honor.
i
don't
believe
he
has.
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
pardon
me?
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
i
understand
from
my
predecessors
on
this
case
and
of
course
there
had
been
a
number
of
it
the
immediate
way.
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
that
the
assistant
sheriff,
the
one
that
actually
filled
out
the
return,
his
name
i
believe
was
kuhns
was
deceased
sometime
ago,
yes,
in
other
words,
before
the
time
when
the
matter
actually
came
up
in
the
federal
district
court
for
hearing.
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
i'm
not
sure
whether
or
not
your
honor
that
particular
sheriff
testified.
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
i
don't
recall.
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
he,
your
honor,
died
in
1965.
a
short
time
before
this
matter
finally
made
it
to
the
hearing
stage
at
federal
court.
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
there
were
proceedings
attempted
in
the
federal
district
court
as
early
as
1948
or
1949.
about
the
time
that
petitioner
obtained
an
affidavit
from
mr.
orsucci.
however,
no
hearing
was
held
until
after
he
deceased.
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
i
don't
believe
your
honor
that
a
hearing
was
specifically
requested
on
your
association.
many
issues
--
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
yes,
your
honor.
there
are
many,
many
issues
before
the
court
and
i
believe
that
was
one
of
them.
if
i
may,
the
rule
we
think
is
entirely
applicable
here
and
were
not
contesting
any
of
this
court's
rules.
it's
in
brady
versus
maryland
and
i
quote
from
373
u.s.
page
87,
“the
suppression
by
the
prosecution
of
evidence
favorable
to
an
accused
upon
request
violates
due
process
where
the
evidence
is
material
either
to
guilt
or
punishment
irrespective
of
good
faith
or
bad
faith
of
the
prosecution.”
but
we
submit
that
the
petitioner
has
freely
admitted
the
purpose
for
which
mr.
orsucci
was
going
to
be
used.
that
is,
he
was
going
to
be
used
to
impeach
one
of
the
two
eyewitnesses
of
the
flight
of
the
two
people
from
the
scene
of
the
murder.
mr.
orsucci
was
not
going
to
be
used
to
say
that
mr.
johnson
was
not
the
one
but
he
was
going
to
be
used
to
impeach
one
of
those
witnesses
who
had
a
previously
identified
mr.
orsucci
as
being
the
partner
of
mr.
johnson.
now,
we
think
that
his
testimony
going
by
what
the
petitioner
admits.
it
was
going
to
be,
was
probably
not
favorable
to
his
case
and
secondly,
we
don't
think
and
we
completely
agree
with
all
the
federal
courts
below
that
even
if
this
testimony
have
been
presented
it
would
have
not
--
would
not
have
been
material
to
guilt
or
punishment.
the
impeachment
would
not
have
affected
the
very
sure
testimony
of
the
two
witnesses
as
to
the
petition.
it
would
have
only
affected
the
unsureness
of
one
of
the
witnesses.
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
well,
your
honor,
because
it
was
said
in
brady
that
irrespective
of
good
faith
or
bad
faith
of
prosecution,
i
think
the
handwriting
is
on
the
wall,
that
perhaps
that's
sure.
but
i
must
call
attention
to
the
court
that
the
eighth
circuit
did
not
reach
that
position
because
it
found
that
the
testimony
would
have
not
have
been
material
so
i
don't
think
this
court
really
has
to
go
--
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
i
think
the
evidence
would
have
to
be
found
material
before
we
could
arrive
to
that
question.
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
yes.
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
well
your
honor,
mr.
chief
justice
i
think
that
it
would
not
and
i
take
this
position
based
upon
the
peculiar
facts
of
this
case.
the
two
attorneys
that
represented
the
defendant
at
that
trial
or
have
been
found
to
be
very
able
review
of
the
trial
transcript
record
shows
that
they
were
very
vigorous.
they
tried
very
hard
to
shake
these
two
witnesses
as
to
their
identification
of
the
petitioner
and
they
were
steadfast.
i
believe
this
further
because
i
think
the
defense
used
this
many
witnesses
or
several
witnesses
ahead
as
an
alibi.
i
think
that
the
impeachment
would
have
merely
amounted
to
one
more
alibi
witness.
and
therefore,
i
do
not
think
i
agree
with
the
court
of
appeals
below
that
even
if
that
testimony
had
been
presented
it
would
have
not
impeached
the
one
witness
little
own
both.
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
no,
your
honor
for
this
reason.
i
believe
that
it
would
have
made
states
case
perhaps
even
stronger
if
the
witness
would
have
said
true,
i
am
unsure
about
the
one
man
but
yet
i'm
sure
about
the
defendant.
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
no.
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
mr.
chief
justice,
only
one
of
the
witnesses
i
believe
was
going
to
be
impeached
of
course.
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
yes.
no,
i
quite
candidly
think
that
mr.
orsucci's
involvement
in
this
case
that
the
possibility
that
maybe
he
was
the
other
witness
would
have
been
looked
upon
by
the
jury
and
is
more
favorable
to
the
state
perhaps
than
to
the
defendant.
i
don't
think
impeachment
of
that
witness
could
have
been
obtained.
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
no,
sir.
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
mr.
justice
--
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
well,
mr.
justice,
this
is
exactly
our
point
i
believe.
the
jury
in
1934
was
present
and
they
have
some
43
witnesses
i
believe
to
look
at.
they
disbelieve
obviously
petitioner's
witnesses
because
if
they
would
have,
they
would
have
found
him
not
guilty.
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
mr.
justice,
i
think
we
must
rely
upon
what
petitioner
says.
he
would
have
used
that
one
as
far.
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
very
much
so.
i
--
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
well,
not
with
any
reasonable
probability.
i
think
it
is
subject
to
some
speculation.
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
i
might
add
that
much
has
been
made
about
if
whether
or
not
this
particular
witness
would
have
been
favorable.
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
an
affidavit
was
obtained
in
1949
from
this
mr.
orsucci
saying
that
he
had
evidence
relevant
to
the
defense.
nothing
further
was
ever
done
on
that,
apparently,
although
of
course
as
we've
already
seen
the
petitioner
did
try
to
get
a
hearing
in
federal
court.
he
did
manage
in
1961,
three
or
four
years
before
mr.
orsucci
died.
he
did
manage
to
get
the
court
to
direct
a
deposition
be
taken
of
another
witness
mr.
ruggles
on
a
perjury
question.
well,
mr.
ruggles
lived
in
california
and
by
the
petitioner's
own
admission
in
the
habeas
corpus
hearing
when
he
finally
did
get
it.
he
spent
almost
$2,000.00
obtaining
this
particular
deposition
while
mr.
orsucci
was
not
in
california
but
in
des
moines
and
he
admitted
that
his
brother
often
talked
with
mr.
orsucci.
yet,
no
testimony
was
ever
perpetuated
from
this,
what
is
claim
now,
key
important
witness,
mr.
orsucci.
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
i
don't
believe
i
understand.
he
could
have
taken
the
deposition
of
mr.
orsucci
in
des
moines
i
think
if
he
could
take
the
deposition
of
mr.
ruggles
in
california
which
--
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
well,
i
don't
quite
know
the
answer
to
that
mr.
chief
justice
but
i
do
know
that
in
this
court,
or
rather
in
the
federal
district
court,
the
judge
did
order
a
deposition
to
be
taken
in
1961
of
this
mr.
ruggles
and
i
--
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
well,
i
--
my
point
is
that
if
this
could
have
been
done
with
regard
to
mr.
ruggles
under
federal
law,
i
believe
that
because
at
that
time
the
petitioner's
attorney
i
believe
was
from
des
moines.
his
brother
was
there
and
so
as
mr.
orsucci
that
could
have
been
accomplished
relatively
easily
compared
with
the
other.
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
i,
quite
honestly
your
honor,
i
don't
know.
one
other
point
i'll
raise
very
quickly
and
then
go
on
to
the
next.
it
is
shown
in
the
habeas
corpus
district
court
hearing
that
the
petitioner
was
in
fact
out
of
prison
for
two
and
a
half
or
three
years.
it
appears
that
he
walked
away
from
a
prison
farm
in
1953
and
was
later
recaptured
in
1956
in
detroit
having
spent
most
of
his
time
in
canada.
we
would
thus
submit
that
again
if
mr.
orsucci
had
been
as
important
a
witness
as
he
is
now
claimed,
perhaps
the
petitioner
might
have
done
something
during
that
time.
and
this
also
might
answer
the
question
which
was
raised
yesterday
about
the
parole.
i
think
the
question
is
not
why
parole
has
not
been
granted
but
why
the
governor
of
the
state
was
able
to
commute
the
sentence
has
not
commuted
the
sentence?
perhaps,
that
had
something
to
do
with
once
the
sentence
is
commuted
of
course
to
a
term
of
years
then
parole
could
thereafter
be
granted.
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
the
petitioner
walked
away
from
a
prison
farm
in
1953.
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
he
admitted
this
during
his
testimony
before
the
federal
district
court.
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
a
reported
burglary
had
brought
forth
several
burlington
policemen.
they
surrounded
the
store
that
was
reported
being
burglarized
and
when
this
captain
sauer
went
to
one
side
or
to
the
back
of
the
store,
shots
were
heard
and
he
was
found
wounded
with
shotgun
wounds.
he
later
died.
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
but
he
did
not
testify
or
of
course
speak
who
was
--
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
it
was
the
least
of
the
three
convictions
offered
to
the
jury
and
they
took
that
one,
yes.
the
false
evidence
which
has
claimed
here
has
to
do
with
the
notes
which
were
intercepted
by
other
prisoners
presented
to
prison
official
and
made
their
halfway
into
the
hands
of
the
prosecutor.
now,
this
court's
decision
in
miller
versus
pate,
and
that
was
bloody
shorts
case
was
completely
avoided
by
the
petitioner
in
his
brief
here
until
reply.
but
we
think
the
rule
is
directly
on
point
that
was
used
by
the
eighth
circuit
and
that
is
this
and
i
quote
from
386
u.s.
page
7.
“the
fourteenth
amendment
cannot
tolerate
a
state
criminal
conviction
obtained
by
the
knowing
use
of
false
evidence.”
well,
there
are
two
critical
points
which
lead
us
to
believe
that
that
particular
rule
does
not
require
a
finding
of
violation
of
due
process
here.
first
of
all,
the
falsity
of
the
notes
is
still
simply
a
matter
of
opinion.
secondly,
regardless
of
what
is
said
today,
the
notes
were
before
the
jury
in
all
their
ramifications.
the
witnesses
for
both
sides
testified.
it
was
before
the
jury
that
perhaps
they
were
forged.
a
mr.
yates,
a
defense
witness
got
up
and
gave
very
clear
testimony
that
he
did
not
think
the
petitioner
had
written
the
notes.
furthermore,
the
court
gave
a
very
clear
instruction
telling
the
jury
that
this
sort
of
thing
and
one
can
imagine
it
might
have
even
more
true
in
1934,
that
this
sort
of
evidence
was
the
lowest
form
of
evidence.
so,
we
believe
that
the
jury
was
completely
aware
of
the
circumstances
surrounding
these
notes
that
it
was
a
jury
determination
to
be
made
then
and
the
jury's
decision
we
are
sure
even
if
there
had
been
the
expert
testimony
available
today
would
have
been
relatively
the
same
as
was
then.
we
don't
know
whether
the
jury
found
they
were
false
or
not.
but
i
do
think
that
their
weight
was
entirely
decimated
by
the
instruction
and
by
the
able
objections
the
able
other
witnesses
presented
by
the
defense
on
this
particular
subject.
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
the
expert
testimony
in
the
hearing
was
presented
by
the
petitioner.
the
state
also
had
expert
opinion
but
i
don't
recall
that
the
expert
was
there
however,
it
was
admitted
at
the
hearing
that
the
state
expert
had
looked
at
the
notes
and
had
concluded
the
same
as
the
expert
before
the
petitioner
in
1965,
i
believe
it
was.
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
to
my
last
knowledge
which
was
years
so
ago,
he
was
your
honor.
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
well,
based
upon
what
the
state
expert
said
and
based
on
the
lapse
and
years,
quite
frankly
i
don't
know
why
they
didn't
use
mr.
foxen
again,
but
i
think
it
was
admitted
by
the
state
at
that
hearing
that
the
state
expert
had
concluded
the
same
as
the
petitioner's
expert.
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
no,
your
honor
and
i
think
this
is
a
good
point
which
has
been
raised
here.
the
return
to
in
order
to
show
cause
i
believe
it
was,
the
state
said
based
upon
the
testimony,
it
would
appear
that
the
notes
were
wrongfully
admitted.
however,
we
contend
now
that
this
was
not
an
admission
of
falsity
but
only
the
reasonable
conclusion
that
notes
or
rather
the
expert's
opinion
in
1965
was
different
than
it
was
in
1934
and
there's
no
showing
or
no
hand
even
that
the
1934
examination
was
fraudulent
in
anyway.
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
i
believe
it
was
merely
stated
by
counsel
at
the
end
of
the
hearing
following
--
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
i
don't
believe
he
did
testify,
no
sir.
but
it
was
stated
that
if
he
did,
he
would
testify
relatively
the
same.
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
well,
no
mr.
justice.
i
don't
think
so
because
i
think
this
is
a
jury
question.
and
i
think
that
in
1965,
it
would
be
entirely
improper
based
merely
upon
expert
testimony
or
the
state
to
usurp
the
jury
function
and
the
state
beyond
what
the
jury
had
in
1934
that
these
notes
were
false.
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
yes,
sir.
this
was
the
letter
that
i
believe
i
refer
to.
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
yes,
there's
no
question
about
that.
now
the
--
in
conclusion
on
that
point,
though
we
think
that
the
petitioner
received
due
process
by
protection
of
the
jury
and
we
think
that
this
would
be
the
same
in
1968,
as
it
was
in
1934.
finally,
the
alibi
instruction
--
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
i
think
mr.
chief
justice
based
on
expert
opinion,
this
is
all
we
have
to
go
on,
yes.
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
well,
if
this
is
considered
an
admission,
i
don't
think
the
state
can
admit
to
such
a
thing
on
mere
expert
opinion.
i
think
it
ought
to
be
more.
but
even
if
it
is
admitted
that
this
--
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
i
think
if
the
man
who
actually
authored
the
notes
stepped
forward
and
said
i
did
those,
not
the
petitioner,
i
think
the
state
would
then
be
in
the
position
that
they
would
have
to
admit
that
they
were
not.
what
it's
doing
here
by
if
it
were
to
admit
as
taking
the
jury
function.
but
the
point
is
mr.
chief
justice,
the
jury
was
well
informed
of
all
these.
we
think
everything
short
of
expert
opinion
to
the
contrary
in
1934.
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
no
knowing
use
by
the
prosecutor
or
anyone
else
who
state.
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
i
think
so.
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
i
think
this
is
a
reasonable
conclusion,
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
if
they
were
believed.
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
no,
i
say
they
probably
were
not
believed
in
1934
because
of
the
strong
case
the
defense
took
against
them
even
presenting
a
witness
who
claimed
that
the
petitioner
had
not
written
and
that
he
thought
that
they
had
been
forged.
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
this
is
true
but
again
i
think
the
court's
instruction
to
the
jury
reduced
their
credibility
greatly
by
saying
these
are
the
lowest
form
of
evidence
and
the
jury
should
take
great
care
in
looking
at
it.
finally,
on
the
alibi
issue,
there
are
three
positions
involved.
one,
of
the
majority
of
the
iowa
supreme
court,
one
of
the
eighth
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
overruling
stump,
and
then
there
is
an
intermediate
position.
the
three
positions
are
unwise
instruction
and
unconstitutional.
the
other
is
unwise
but
not
unconstitutional,
and
the
third
is
wise
and
constitutional.
we
submit
that
the
medial
--
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
yes,
sir,
three
levels
i
think
the
stump
versus
bennett
opinion
by
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
the
third
one
your
honors,
the
view,
the
present
view
of
the
majority
of
the
iowa
supreme
court.
we
submit
that
chief
judge
van
oosterhoout's
opinion
below
and
his
dissent
in
the
stump
versus
bennett
case
are
indeed
the
wisest
of
all
positions.
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
i
think
the
handwriting
is
on
the
wall,
even
before
the
iowa
supreme
court
after
reading
their
carter
case
that
perhaps
it's
not
the
best
but
wouldn't
go
so
far
as
to
say
it's
unconstitutional
for
the
reasons
of
course
set
forth
in
our
brief
and
for
the
same
reasons
this
court
found
the
--
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
for
the
same
reasons
this
court
found
the
insanity
instruction
which
was
required
to
be
proven
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt
was
not
violative
of
due
process
in
leland
versus
oregon.
mr.
william
a.
claerhout
the
petitioner
i
understand
was
born
in
1905.
thank
you.
