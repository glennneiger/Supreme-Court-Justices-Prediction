what
objection
was
made
to
the
introduction

notes?
justice

justice

neither
you
nor
the

did.
you
didn't
see
and
you
don't

justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how

you
predict

he

we
assumed
that
this

the
other
witnesses

there's
no
way
anybody
can
predict
what
effect
he
would
have
on
that
jury?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
what
i
was
thinking.
