justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather
then
you
make
no
point
of
the
fact
that
this
was
a
sheriff
of
a
county
of
165
miles
away.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know,
i
just
wondered
what
was
your
position.
i
gather
from
what
you
--
the
answer
you
just
gave
me
that
you
would
not
think
if
this
were
a
proper
case
with
its
application
because
that
would
not
--
that
would
make
impossible
the
application
rule
on
suppression.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
at
the
very,
the
maximum
the
defense
can
claim
is
that
the
expert
for
the
state
in
1934
was
mistaken?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
that
--
but
that
honestly
mistaken
if
he
was
mistaken?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
mr.
carlson.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
suppose
this
gets
back
to
the
colloquy
you
and
i
had
earlier.
on
this
note
issue,
simply
we
haven't
yet
have
we
when
this
court
said
that
a
false
testimony
gets
in.
that's
favorable
conviction
unless
it
was
knowing,
got
in
with
the
knowledge
of
its
falsely
on
the
part
of
the
prosecution.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
mean,
hasn't
that
been
our
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
in
my
mind
mr.
carlson,
i
suppose
is
not
a
trial
carried
on
this
that
this
perjured
testimony
doesn't
get
in
whether
its
false
or
in
any
event
whether
it's
in
fact
perjury.
are
you
suggesting
that
wherever
it's
established
that
it's
in
fact
false;
however
innocent
the
prosecutor
may
be
of
knowledge
of
its
falsity
that
that
ought
to
be
a
rule
which
requires
the
offsetting
of
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
a
different
place.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words
you're
saying
this
is
within
the
rule
that
there's
something
which
establishes
that
he
knew
of
the
falsity
of
this.
i
gather
the
handwriting
expert
is
against
you
on
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
before
you
sit
down
mr.
carlson.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
a
little
confused
about
this
35-year
business
i
think
you
told
us
yesterday
that
the
iowa
practices
and
the
life
sentence,
this
is
without
possible
of
the
parole
and
if
it's
to
be
short
of
actual
life,
there
must
be
a
commutation
of
it.
now,
i
thought
that
the
attorney
general
said
differently,
am
i
wrong?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
now,
has
there
been
any
effort
to
get
commutation
of
johnson
sentence?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
recommendation
for
what?
for
commutation?

see.
