mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
thank
you
your
honor.
may
it
please
the
court,
i
am
ronald
carlson
from
iowa
city,
iowa.
i'm
here
today
your
honors
representing
gale
johnson
who
is
a
prisoner
at
iowa
state
penitentiary
in
fort
madison,
iowa.
mr.
johnson
was
originally
charged
in
this
case
with
the
crime
of
murder.
the
jury,
your
honors,
was
presented
with
four
alternative
verdict
forms:
murder
in
the
first
degree
with
death
penalty,
murder
in
the
first
degree
with
life
imprisonment,
murder
in
the
second
degree,
or
not
guilty.
the
jury
rejected
the
first
two
alternatives
that
is
the
first-degree
murder
alternatives
and
found
mr.
johnson
guilty
of
murder
in
the
second
degree.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes,
34
years
ago
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
well,
--
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes.
now,
we
have
a
rule
there
i
believe
your
honor
that
provides
that
the
life
sentence
is
non-parolable
and
has
to
be
commutable
to
a
term
of
years.
so,
at
the
present
time
i
believe
he
is
being
considered
for
parole
right
now
but
there's
nothing
certain
about
it
and
i
believe
he
would
have
to
undergo
the
commutation
first.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes,
that's
right.
now,
he
claims
certain
very
distinct
errors
occurred
in
his
trial
your
honors.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
sure.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes,
he
has.
he
has
been
denied
evidentiary
hearings
on
every
occasion,
--
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
--
say
the
one
below.
1949,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes.
but
well
the
witness
who
was
suppressed
was
still
alive
which
is
very
important.
he
in
fact
filed
three
habeas
corpus,
i
believe
that
year.
then
he
filed
again
in
federal
habeas
corpus
in
1960.
again,
the
witness
was
still
alive
and
he
was
still
trying.
he
took
an
affidavit
from
the
witness
in
the
meantime.
he
filed
for
habeas
corpus
again
in
the
iowa
supreme
court
as
an
original
petition
in
1966.
this
again
was
denied
without
hearing.
he
then
went
back
to
federal
district
court
to
file
for
habeas
corpus
again.
now,
he
got
his
evidentiary
hearing.
now,
he
was
able
to
put
off
record
the
significant
facts
about
the
suppression
that
we're
talking
about
here
today.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes,
at
least
your
honor
he
was
an
indigent
as
it
pertained
to
his
securing
of
witnesses.
now,
by
reason
of
his
poverty
he
was
entitled
to
use
a
statute
under
which
he
could
subpoena
witnesses
if
he
could
show
the
trial
court
that
the
witness
was
material
and
necessary
to
the
defense.
he
made
application
and
the
court
granted
the
subpoena
under
the
statute
so
apparently
that
was
the
case.
now,
the
statute
admittedly
that
he
subpoenaed
his
witness
under
required
him
to
make
a
preliminary
showing
of
the
necessity
of
this
witness.
so,
he
went
to
trial
court
back
in
1934.
he
applied
for
this
witness
and
the
subpoena
was
issued.
it
was
sent
from
the
county
of
trial
approximately
165
miles
away
to
the
county
of
the
residence
of
the
witness.
now,
this
witness's
name
was
mr.
orsucci.
mr.
orsucci
lived
in
our
city
of
des
moines
and
the
sheriff
in
polk
county
which
is
des
moines,
iowa
received
this
subpoena
and
did
not
serve
it.
in
fact
he
made
a
subpoena
return
indicating
the
witness
could
not
be
served
and
that
the
witness,
mr.
orsucci
was
confined
in
a
mental
institution.
now,
your
honors,
i'm
very
sorry
to
say
this
was
not
true.
in
fact
this
witness,
mr.
orsucci,
was
at
the
very
time
of
the
subpoena
return
under
lock
and
key
of
the
very
sheriff
whose
responsibility
it
was
to
serve
the
subpoena.
now,
this
fact
that
i'm
now
stating
is
beyond
dispute
in
this
proceeding.
so
we
have
a
purely
legal
question
i
think
involved.
the
records
of
the
polk
county
jail
were
subpoenaed
into
the
habeas
corpus
hearing
below
and
i
reflected
them
in
our
appendix
here.
they
demonstrate
that
this
witness
that
was
subpoenaed
by
the
defendant
was
in
fact
during
the
course
of
the
trial
in
the
polk
county
jail
at
the
relevant
times.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
your
honor,
the
facts
i
think
would
exclude
the
mistake
analysis.
if
your
honor's
question
goes
to
whether
we
have
direct
admissions
of
the
sheriff
or
prosecuting
officer
that
they
were
locking
the
man
up
to
keep
him
away
from
the
trial
we
don't
have
such
admissions.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
we
do
have
the
finding
of
the
court
of
appeals
below
for
instance
which
says
the
evidence
on
the
point
establishes
a
prima
facie
case
that
the
sheriff
made
a
false
return.
that
also,
your
honor,
is
established
by
our
trial
court's
finding
below
in
which
--
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
well,
your
honor,
the
trial
court
made
an
independent
investigation
at
the
mental
institution.
he
concluded
i
believe
his
order
appears
on
page
34
of
our
appendix
that
the
records
there
show
that
this
witness
was
never
entered
there
as
a
patient
and
he
could
find
no
evidence
that
he
transfer
of
the
witness
to
the
mental
institution
was
contemplated.
so
while
the
sheriff
put
on
the
return,
your
witness
is
in
the
mental
institution,
is
virtually
unexplainable.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes,
he
has
desist,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
that's
exactly
right
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
right.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
your
honor
positing
clear
proof
that
the
trial
prosecutor
in
our
county
of
trial
was
aware
of
what
was
going
on
in
des
moines.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes,
although
clearly
was
in
the
spirit
your
honor
and
i
think
the
due
process
clause
protects
against
governmental
action.
and
cases
have
said
that
you
can't
carve
out
the
government
into
small
units.
in
other
words,
if
sheriff's
officers
in
another
county
brutalized
the
confession
from
a
defendant,
could
it
be
said
that
the
prosecutor
at
a
different
county
could
take
the
confession
on
a
silver
platter
and
use
it.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
this
is
clear.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
this
is
exactly
right
and
i
consider
it
very
consistent
one,
your
honor,
nothing
inconsistent.
i
will
in
connection
with
the
false
notes
that
were
introduced
into
the
trial
to
speak
just
a
little
bit
about
the
prosecutor's
participation
but
it
does
not
play
a
role
in
this
particular
aspect
that
we
can
point
to
in
the
record.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
well,
i
don't
think
it's
that
clear
i
think
there
can
be
an
attempt
to
retrial
we'll
just
have
to
cross
that
bridge
when
we
come
to
it.
i
think
--
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
many
witnesses
are
unavailable.
i
think
it
would
be
very
difficult
your
honor.
now,
the
suppression
point
that
we
have
mentioned
here
your
honors,
the
respondent
treats
at
page
7
of
the
respondent's
briefs
saying
the
fact
that
a
requested
defense
witness
was
held
in
jail
during
the
course
of
petitioner's
trial
is
undisputed.
so
as
i
say,
there
apparently
is
no
fact
issue
on
that
key
question.
now,
the
respondent
would
deny
the
due
process
implications
which
we
alleged
exist
in
this
particular
situation
by
saying
basically
that
the
case
is
an
old
one.
the
respondent
asserts
that
the
petitioner
in
the
years
ensuing
since
his
conviction
has
more
or
less
sat
on
his
hands.
in
respondent's
brief,
resisting
certiorari,
the
respondent
stated
the
unusual
age
of
this
case
combined
with
the
death
of
the
witness
and
the
lack
of
concern
by
the
petitioner
while
the
witness
was
alive
served
a
highlight
his
lack
of
availability
of
relief
here.
it's
her
point
that
he
has
saw
it
in
every
way
he
knows
how
and
every
way
a
man
in
the
penitentiary
can
do
to
keep
his
case
alive,
to
bring
it
on
for
hearing.
and
it
seems
to
us
that
it
is
especially
unseemly
for
the
state
to
take
this
position
when
they
have
resisted
his
attempts
to
get
this
case
in
the
court.
to
get
these
witnesses
evidence
before
the
judge
of
record.
now,
to
say
well
he
sat
on
his
hands.
i
think
the
record
bears
out
that
he
has
filed
one
habeas
corpus
after
another.
in
addition
to
that,
he
has
not
left
us
of
completely
dry
as
it
pertains
to
exactly
what
this
witness
experience
was.
he
did
obtain
an
affidavit
from
the
man
which
appears
at
page
33
of
our
appendix
wherein
mr.
orsucci
said,
“on
the
relevant
date,
i
was
confined
in
polk
county
jail.
i
saw
in
the
des
moines
register
a
news
item
saying
i
was
being
sought
for
witness.”
he
tells
that
he
has
to
note
to
the
turn
key
wanted
to
be
let
out,
and
pass
the
note
for
the
judge.
his
requests
were
denied
and
he
was
never
served
with
subpoena.
now,
the
idea
of
prosecutorial
knowledge
--
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
no,
there
was
not
your
honor.
his
particular
position
in
the
trial
of
the
case
is
not
much
referred
to
and
we
have
our
ideas
of
how
it
would
have
been
used
and
i
think
he
certainly
was
a
key
figure
in
this
whole
thing.
he'd
been
arrested
for
this
murder
and
clearly
i
think
the
defense
wanted
him
to
point
out
that
the
state's
witnesses
down
there
in
burlington,
the
place
of
the
trial
had
identified
him
as
being
one
of
the
man
implicated
and
he
would
have
very
clearly
undercut
their
credibility
had
he
been
produced,
i
think.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
pardon
me,
your
honor?
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
at
burlington,
iowa
your
honor
is
where
my
petitioner
was
tried.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
well,
there
were
two
witnesses
in
burlington
at
the
scene
who
had
identified
my
petitioner
and
one
of
them
apparently
made
an
identification
of
this
mr.
orsucci
as
well
which
prove
to
be
erroneous.
now
--
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
that
is
precisely
right
your
honor,
that's
exactly
what
the
law
provided.
now,
prosecutorial
knowledge
place
a
great
role
or
lack
there
of
in
connection
with
a
second
development
in
this
trial.
there
was
introduced
we
contend
false
documents,
false
notes
against
the
petitioner.
the
state
penitentiary
at
fort
madison
and
i
think
this
is
undisputed
was
a
great
focus
for
the
prosecutor
to
be
investigating
before
the
trial.
the
evidence
on
both
sides
--
oh!
excuse
me.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
thank
you
very
much
your
honor.
may
it
please
the
court.
your
honors,
at
the
conclusion
remarks
yesterday,
counsel
had
mentioned
that
the
iowa
state
penitentiary
of
fort
madison
had
prior
to
my
client's
trial
become
the
focus
of
investigation
by
the
prosecuting
attorney's
office.
he
had
interviewed
prisoners
there
but
what
they
might
know
about
mr.
johnson,
what
they
have
been
able
to
find
out
and
so
forth.
two
prisoners
ultimately
came
up
with
a
report
admissions
made
by
mr.
johnson
to
this
offense,
oral
admissions
as
well
as
notes
which
were
introduced
at
the
trial
at
state's
exhibits
number
1
and
2.
these
notes
sought
to
portray
the
prisoner
in
this
case
is
a
man
seeking
to
cook
up
an
alibi
to
the
record.
the
prisoner
said
that
they
got
the
notes
when
my
client
was
trying
to
smuggle
them
outside
the
penitentiary.
now,
these
notes
were
also
validated
at
trial
by
a
handwriting
expert
called
by
the
state.
this
handwriting
expert
said
that
mr.
johnson
who
was
required
to
print
this
card,
handwriting
exemplar
card
was
the
same
hand
who
had
printed
the
two
notes.
now,
on
later
years
your
honor,
mr.
johnson
in
about
1960
was
able
to
send
these
three
exhibits
to
a
handwriting
expert
who
was
a
leading
authority
in
this
country
on
the
subject.
this
man
made
a
detailed
examination
of
the
handwriting
on
the
exemplar
card
detailed
analysis
of
that
appearing
on
the
two
notes
and
he
concluded
that
the
original
trial
testimony
was
completely
wrong.
that
the
notes
were
not
written
by
mr.
johnson,
that
they
were
in
fact
apparently
forged
notes.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
they
are
printed
in
the
appendix
your
honor
but
in
this
form,
they
are
not.
they
do
appear
with
the
exhibits
that
we
have
sent
to
the
court
however.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes,
it
did
although
for
reasons
that
i'll
mention
we
were
not
able
to
present
any
handwriting
analysis
of
our
own,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes.
and
that
was
presented
by
the
state.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
the
sample
used
was
a
printed
card,
your
honor
which
is
introduced
in
evidence
in
--
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes,
that's
very
important
your
honor.
in
other
words,
our
handwriting
known
sample
is
the
1934
handwriting
of
mr.
johnson,
the
very
same
that
was
used
to
this
trial.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes,
there
was
a
mr.
foxen
called
by
the
state.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes,
he
did,
your
honor.
he
said
that
--
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
that's
right.
they
say
the
opinion
at
that
time
was
erroneous.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
it
is
perhaps
significant
your
honor
that
in
connection
with
other
evidence
in
the
case,
my
client
received
notice
of
that
about
two
months
before
trial.
the
prosecution
had
these
notes
in
july.
our
trial
was
in
november.
on
this
evidence,
notice
was
served
six
days
before
the
trial.
not
on
the
petitioner's
attorneys
but
upon
the
petitioner
in
his
jai
cell.
he
hurriedly
wrote
his
lawyers
telling
them
that
there
was
some
notes
that
are
going
to
be
introduced,
didn't
even
have
copies.
all
he
had
was
a
notice
that
this
was
going
to
be
used
against
him.
the
lawyer
got
down
after
he
got
the
letter
one
day
in
advance
the
trial
still
no
copies
just
the
notice
and
some
notes
would
be
used.
there
was
no
opportunity
afforded
for
the
defense.
as
far
as
i
can
see
to
give
this
evidence
the
kind
of
scrutiny
which
would
have
revealed
its
falsity.
well,
the
serving
of
that
notice
may
have
been
technically
correct.
we
question
the
propriety
seeing
that
the
genesis
of
these
notes
was
penitentiary
inmates.
in
not
affording
the
defense
and
opportunity
to
give
this
careful
screening
--
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
no,
i
think
not
perhaps
your
honor.
i
think
what
we
would
have
been
able
to
establish
is
that
those
two
prisoners
were
not
giving
honest
testimony.
the
ones
who
produced
the
notes
because
these
notes
had
to
been
printed
by
someone,
the
current
evidence
says
mr.
johnson
did
not
print
those
notes
and
i
think
inferentially
from
the
record,
it
appears
that
perhaps
these
two
prisoners
who
produced
them
or
someone
that
they
were
working
with
perhaps
printed
it.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
that
leaves
us
right
here
your
honor.
i
think
in
pyle
versus
kansas,
a
point
was
made
that
if
false
evidence
comes
into
the
case,
even
though
the
prosecutor
does
not
know
about
it.
if
that's
--
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
i
think
it
comes
down
to
whose
opinion
is
correct,
your
honor.
i
think
if
the
opinion
today
is
correct
then
we
submit
it
is
and
state
has
had
this
now
examined
by
their
own
expert
here
very
currently.
at
the
state
very
few
investigation,
he
said,
it
is
--
this
expert
says
it
is
correct.
mr.
johnson
did
not
write
these
notes.
and
his
report
--
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
in
the
trial
brief,
the
state
said
we
can
see
that
the
introduction
of
these
notes
were
error.
but
we
simply
say
that
it
didn't
form
material
part
of
the
case.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes,
i
think
that's
true.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
i
think
that's
true
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
no,
there
was
no
defense
opinion
that
was
mastered
at
that
time.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
just
a
denial,
right.
and
this
denial
was
done
by
a
prisoner
named
mr.
yates,
who
said
for
the
defendant
those
notes
were
fictitious.
those
notes
were
false.
i
told
the
prosecuting
attorney
they
were
false.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes,
that
was
before
the
jury
at
the
original
trial.
the
same
prisoner
also
said
that
he
received
a
monetary
offer
of
$25.00
to
assist
by
providing
evidence
or
the
names
of
witnesses
against
the
defendant.
stating
at
page
109
of
our
appendix
or
excuse
me,
page
107,
your
honors,
was
anything
talked
about
any
money
of
any
kind.
well,
mr.
daley
offered
me
$25.00
to
name
the
defense
witnesses.
and
if
we
turn
over
to
the
prosecutor's
closing
argument
on
110,
he
says,
before
i
go
into
that
i
want
to
say
the
state
would
have
been
glad
to
have
paid
yates
$25.00
to
get
the
names
of
the
alibi
witnesses.
now,
we
don't
suggest
that
this
reference
is
absolutely
clear.
but
it
is
perhaps
suggestive
of
a
climate
which
may
have
been
created
the
penitentiary
for
the
production
of
this
kind
of
evidence
which
the
current
expert
opinion
is
was
not
correct.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
he
was
your
honor.
now,
when
this
notice
was
served
on
him
just
on
the
eve
of
trial
he'd
been
transferred
up
to
a
county
jail
at
that
time
but
he
was
in
the
man
in
the
penitentiary.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
they
were
the
very
same
persons,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
same
source
of
testimony
in
both
cases.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
they
were
vigorously
objected
to.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes,
your
honor.
could
i
locate
that
and
i'm
reserving
some
time.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
in
addition
to
the
burdens
of
the
suppressed
witness
and
what
we
contend
is
false
evidence,
our
petitioner
here
was
required,
your
honors,
to
bear
one
further
burden
and
that
was
the
burden
of
proof
on
a
lead
issue
in
this
case.
the
issue
of
whether
the
prisoner
was
at
burlington,
iowa
or
in
des
moines,
165
miles
away
at
the
time
of
the
offense
in
question.
now,
he
presented
here
a
very
strong
alibi
defense.
he
called
the
owner
of
a
gas
station
who
had
filled
his
tank
in
des
moines
that
morning
about
the
time
the
homicide
occurred,
165
miles
away.
he
traded
there
for
about
a
year
and
this
appears
to
be
an
independent
witness,
no
particular
acts
to
(inaudible).
but
later
that
morning,
the
owner
of
the
cigar
counter
said,
“mr.
johnson
was
in.
his
father
was
here
and
bought
a
cigar.”
i'm
not
asking
the
court
here
to
retry
these
facts
but
i'm
simply
raising
the
point
that
a
strong
alibi
defense
was
presented.
several
witnesses,
many
of
them
independent
placed
my
client
in
the
city
of
des
moines
at
a
point
where
it
would
have
been
impossible
for
him
to
have
committed
this
murder
if
they
were
believed.
now,
the
trial
court
because
we
had
gone
ahead
and
called
witnesses
on
this
point
of
alibi,
instructed
the
jury
that
in
order
to
prevail
on
none
presence
at
the
scene,
the
defendant
was
required
to
prove
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that
he
was
elsewhere.
as
mr.
justice
brennan
pointed
out
in
speiser
versus
randall,
the
burden
of
proof
may
well
be
determinative
in
a
given
case
and
for
that
reason,
we
suggest
that
this
instruction
given
by
the
trial
court
as
well
as
the
references
by
the
prosecuting
attorney
which
appear
on
page
113
and
114
of
our
record
were
highly
detrimental
to
our
prisoner's
presumption
of
innocence
in
his
fair
trial
rights
in
this
case.
it
is
up
to
the
defense,
the
prosecutor
said,
the
burden
of
proof
of
alibi
and
they
have
to
prove
that.
the
court
will
instruct
you
that
they
have
to
prove
alibi.
again,
the
prosecutor
said,
“are
you
going
to
accept
the
alibi
of
pool-hall
hangers-on
and
friend
of
johnson
and
his
relation
when
the
man
himself
has
never
denied
it
under
oath?”
certainly,
he
tells
the
jury.
“certainly,
you
are
entitled
to
know
what
he
has
to
say
and
remember
the
burden
of
proof
of
alibi
rests
on
the
defense,
and
they
have
to
meet
that
burden.”
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
no,
there
was
not
at
this
time,
your
honor.
this
was
a
judicial
interpretation
that
it
brought
us
to
this
point.
later
on
iowa
enacted
a
statute
requiring
the
defendant
to
give
the
names
of
his
alibi
witnesses
in
advance.
but
that
is
not
involved
in
this
case.
now,
apparently
iowa
and
two
states
or
one
other
state,
iowa
and
georgia
observed
to
this
rule
and
every
federal
case
that
we've
been
able
to
discover
has
struck
down
charging
the
jury
that
the
defendant
has
the
burden
the
proof
on
this
lead
issue
in
the
case.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes,
it
held,
it
shetters
the
presumption
of
innocence
and
unfairly
penalizes
the
defendant.
your
honor,
since
you
asked
that
question,
i
should
mention
a
case
which
is
not
in
the
advance
sheets
yet
for
you.
this
is
a
very
recent
one,
state
of
iowa
versus
larry
carter
which
will
be
out
in
northwest
in
a
couple
of
weeks,
i
anticipate.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
larry
carter,
c-a-r-t-e-r
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
it
was
filed
october
15,
1968
and
on
the
point
of
what
is
the
law
in
iowa,
the
supreme
court
notes
that
this
case
is
before
the
court
and
suggest
the
matter
will
probably
be
decided
by
the
supreme
court
in
the
near
future
and
then
instructs
the
trial
courts
not
to
give
this
instruction
pending
any
disposition
this
court
might
make.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes,
there
was
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
the
objection
took
the
form
of
saying
that
the
instruction
violated
the
petitioner's
rights
and
that
it
disparage
alibi.
and
i'm
frank
to
admit
your
honor
that
the
fairly
complete
attack
i
think
that
we've
made
on
the
alibi
instruction
was
not
spread
on
this
exception.
but
it
was
not
a
case
where
the
trial
counsel
permitted
the
court
to
go
ahead
and
instruct
and
then
combed
the
record
later.
the
resistance
to
this
instruction
was
fully
put
on
record.
your
honors,
i
am
going
to
try
to
save
some
time
so
unless
there
is
question.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
thank
you
your
honor,
may
it
please
the
court.
your
honor,
the
age
of
the
petitioner
as
mr.
justice
black
asked
is
presently
63
years
old
and
i
understand
he
was
29
when
he
entered
the
penitentiary.
mr.
justice
marshall
has
suggested
that
the
effective
orsucci
on
the
jury
is
absolutely
incalculable
at
this
point.
i
think
that's
true
and
had
our
right
to
have
him
secured
as
a
witness
at
the
trial
then
vouchsafed
to
is,
your
honor,
that
there
would
be
no
problem
on
that.
it
is
in
fact
the
responsibility
of
the
state
that
this
was
not
done
and
we
suggest
there
responsibility
in
years
since.
well,
prior
to
the
time
that
mr.
orsucci
died
that
we
were
denied
a
hearing.
their
steady
resistances
to
our
applications
for
hearing
are
off
record.
in
1961,
we
appeared
in
the
district
court
in
the
southern
district
of
iowa,
raised
this
point,
raised
the
point
of
the
false
notes
and
again
we
were
denied
without
hearing,
again
this
was
resisted
by
the
state.
now,
the
witness
dies
in
1965,
the
respondent
says,
well,
you
didn't
preserve
his
testimony.
i
suggest
that
we
had
disabilities
in
preserving
that.
we
did
try
to
take
an
affidavit.
your
honor,
i
have
looked
at
that
california
deposition
and
in
connection
with
the
colloquy
on
that
point,
the
federal
district
court
at
the
time
he
ordered
this
california
deposition
made
clear
that
he
was
doing
it
only
because
the
witness
there,
the
deponent
was
out
of
state,
was
of
old
age
and
there
was
a
possibility
his
testimony
might
be
lost.
now
in
connection
with
the
notes,
the
point
has
been
made
here
that
the
notes
did
occupy
a
very
substantial
place
in
this
trial.
now,
the
trial
record
shows
that
over
40
pages
of
transcript
were
dedicated
on
the
part
of
state
evidence
to
these
notes.
in
addition,
we
urged
to
the
court
that
there
were
exhibits
1
and
2
at
the
original
trial.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
this
was
in
the
1934
trial
your
honor.
mr.
claerhout
suggests
that
because
we
were
able
to
put
on
the
stand
a
prisoner
from
the
state
penitentiary
who
said,
“mr.
prosecutor,
those
notes
were
fictitious,
you
knew
it
and
i
knew
it
and
i
told
you
that.”
that
somehow
now
we
had
destroyed
their
effect
on
the
jury.
this
overlooks
the
fact
that
we
were
not
able
to
generate
expert
testimony
at
that
time
and
the
state's
case
on
this
point
was
much
more
persuasive
at
the
time
of
this
original
trial.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
well,
the
view
of
--
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
this
is
why
i
mentioned
pyle
versus
kansas,
your
honor.
in
that
case,
the
lower
courts
have
all
taken
the
position.
curran
versus
delaware
is
a
good
example.
that
case
involves
no
knowledge
by
the
prosecutor
himself
of
perjured
testimony
and
yet
if
is
shown
to
be
material,
the
point
is
that
the
--
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
well,
i'm
suggesting
there's
evidence
in
this
record
that
this
prosecutor
was
told
this
evidence
was
false.
i'm
suggesting
--
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
that's
right.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
the
findings
are
against
me
on
that,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes,
sir.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
this
is
true
your
honor
but
we
were
denied
notice
of
this
evidence
until
the
very
eve
of
trial.
i
see
my
time
has
expired
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes,
i'll
be
glad
to
--
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
no,
i
believe
he
agrees
with
me
--
the
board
of
parole
has
no
authority
to
parole
a
life
--
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
i'm
not
aware
on
that
point
sir.
i
do
know
as
i
said
yesterday
that
he
is
being
considered
for
recommendation
at
the
present
time
but
what
the
--
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
for
commutation.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
if
there
are
further
questions,
your
honor?
if
not
let
me
thank
the
court
very
much.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
thank
you
your
honor.
may
it
please
the
court,
i
am
ronald
carlson
from
iowa
city,
iowa.
i'm
here
today
your
honors
representing
gale
johnson
who
is
a
prisoner
at
iowa
state
penitentiary
in
fort
madison,
iowa.
mr.
johnson
was
originally
charged
in
this
case
with
the
crime
of
murder.
the
jury,
your
honors,
was
presented
with
four
alternative
verdict
forms:
murder
in
the
first
degree
with
death
penalty,
murder
in
the
first
degree
with
life
imprisonment,
murder
in
the
second
degree,
or
not
guilty.
the
jury
rejected
the
first
two
alternatives
that
is
the
first-degree
murder
alternatives
and
found
mr.
johnson
guilty
of
murder
in
the
second
degree.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes,
34
years
ago
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
well,
--
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes.
now,
we
have
a
rule
there
i
believe
your
honor
that
provides
that
the
life
sentence
is
non-parolable
and
has
to
be
commutable
to
a
term
of
years.
so,
at
the
present
time
i
believe
he
is
being
considered
for
parole
right
now
but
there's
nothing
certain
about
it
and
i
believe
he
would
have
to
undergo
the
commutation
first.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes,
that's
right.
now,
he
claims
certain
very
distinct
errors
occurred
in
his
trial
your
honors.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
sure.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes,
he
has.
he
has
been
denied
evidentiary
hearings
on
every
occasion,
--
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
--
say
the
one
below.
1949,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes.
but
well
the
witness
who
was
suppressed
was
still
alive
which
is
very
important.
he
in
fact
filed
three
habeas
corpus,
i
believe
that
year.
then
he
filed
again
in
federal
habeas
corpus
in
1960.
again,
the
witness
was
still
alive
and
he
was
still
trying.
he
took
an
affidavit
from
the
witness
in
the
meantime.
he
filed
for
habeas
corpus
again
in
the
iowa
supreme
court
as
an
original
petition
in
1966.
this
again
was
denied
without
hearing.
he
then
went
back
to
federal
district
court
to
file
for
habeas
corpus
again.
now,
he
got
his
evidentiary
hearing.
now,
he
was
able
to
put
off
record
the
significant
facts
about
the
suppression
that
we're
talking
about
here
today.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes,
at
least
your
honor
he
was
an
indigent
as
it
pertained
to
his
securing
of
witnesses.
now,
by
reason
of
his
poverty
he
was
entitled
to
use
a
statute
under
which
he
could
subpoena
witnesses
if
he
could
show
the
trial
court
that
the
witness
was
material
and
necessary
to
the
defense.
he
made
application
and
the
court
granted
the
subpoena
under
the
statute
so
apparently
that
was
the
case.
now,
the
statute
admittedly
that
he
subpoenaed
his
witness
under
required
him
to
make
a
preliminary
showing
of
the
necessity
of
this
witness.
so,
he
went
to
trial
court
back
in
1934.
he
applied
for
this
witness
and
the
subpoena
was
issued.
it
was
sent
from
the
county
of
trial
approximately
165
miles
away
to
the
county
of
the
residence
of
the
witness.
now,
this
witness's
name
was
mr.
orsucci.
mr.
orsucci
lived
in
our
city
of
des
moines
and
the
sheriff
in
polk
county
which
is
des
moines,
iowa
received
this
subpoena
and
did
not
serve
it.
in
fact
he
made
a
subpoena
return
indicating
the
witness
could
not
be
served
and
that
the
witness,
mr.
orsucci
was
confined
in
a
mental
institution.
now,
your
honors,
i'm
very
sorry
to
say
this
was
not
true.
in
fact
this
witness,
mr.
orsucci,
was
at
the
very
time
of
the
subpoena
return
under
lock
and
key
of
the
very
sheriff
whose
responsibility
it
was
to
serve
the
subpoena.
now,
this
fact
that
i'm
now
stating
is
beyond
dispute
in
this
proceeding.
so
we
have
a
purely
legal
question
i
think
involved.
the
records
of
the
polk
county
jail
were
subpoenaed
into
the
habeas
corpus
hearing
below
and
i
reflected
them
in
our
appendix
here.
they
demonstrate
that
this
witness
that
was
subpoenaed
by
the
defendant
was
in
fact
during
the
course
of
the
trial
in
the
polk
county
jail
at
the
relevant
times.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
your
honor,
the
facts
i
think
would
exclude
the
mistake
analysis.
if
your
honor's
question
goes
to
whether
we
have
direct
admissions
of
the
sheriff
or
prosecuting
officer
that
they
were
locking
the
man
up
to
keep
him
away
from
the
trial
we
don't
have
such
admissions.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
we
do
have
the
finding
of
the
court
of
appeals
below
for
instance
which
says
the
evidence
on
the
point
establishes
a
prima
facie
case
that
the
sheriff
made
a
false
return.
that
also,
your
honor,
is
established
by
our
trial
court's
finding
below
in
which
--
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
well,
your
honor,
the
trial
court
made
an
independent
investigation
at
the
mental
institution.
he
concluded
i
believe
his
order
appears
on
page
34
of
our
appendix
that
the
records
there
show
that
this
witness
was
never
entered
there
as
a
patient
and
he
could
find
no
evidence
that
he
transfer
of
the
witness
to
the
mental
institution
was
contemplated.
so
while
the
sheriff
put
on
the
return,
your
witness
is
in
the
mental
institution,
is
virtually
unexplainable.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes,
he
has
desist,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
that's
exactly
right
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
right.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
your
honor
positing
clear
proof
that
the
trial
prosecutor
in
our
county
of
trial
was
aware
of
what
was
going
on
in
des
moines.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes,
although
clearly
was
in
the
spirit
your
honor
and
i
think
the
due
process
clause
protects
against
governmental
action.
and
cases
have
said
that
you
can't
carve
out
the
government
into
small
units.
in
other
words,
if
sheriff's
officers
in
another
county
brutalized
the
confession
from
a
defendant,
could
it
be
said
that
the
prosecutor
at
a
different
county
could
take
the
confession
on
a
silver
platter
and
use
it.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
this
is
clear.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
this
is
exactly
right
and
i
consider
it
very
consistent
one,
your
honor,
nothing
inconsistent.
i
will
in
connection
with
the
false
notes
that
were
introduced
into
the
trial
to
speak
just
a
little
bit
about
the
prosecutor's
participation
but
it
does
not
play
a
role
in
this
particular
aspect
that
we
can
point
to
in
the
record.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
well,
i
don't
think
it's
that
clear
i
think
there
can
be
an
attempt
to
retrial
we'll
just
have
to
cross
that
bridge
when
we
come
to
it.
i
think
--
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
many
witnesses
are
unavailable.
i
think
it
would
be
very
difficult
your
honor.
now,
the
suppression
point
that
we
have
mentioned
here
your
honors,
the
respondent
treats
at
page
7
of
the
respondent's
briefs
saying
the
fact
that
a
requested
defense
witness
was
held
in
jail
during
the
course
of
petitioner's
trial
is
undisputed.
so
as
i
say,
there
apparently
is
no
fact
issue
on
that
key
question.
now,
the
respondent
would
deny
the
due
process
implications
which
we
alleged
exist
in
this
particular
situation
by
saying
basically
that
the
case
is
an
old
one.
the
respondent
asserts
that
the
petitioner
in
the
years
ensuing
since
his
conviction
has
more
or
less
sat
on
his
hands.
in
respondent's
brief,
resisting
certiorari,
the
respondent
stated
the
unusual
age
of
this
case
combined
with
the
death
of
the
witness
and
the
lack
of
concern
by
the
petitioner
while
the
witness
was
alive
served
a
highlight
his
lack
of
availability
of
relief
here.
it's
her
point
that
he
has
saw
it
in
every
way
he
knows
how
and
every
way
a
man
in
the
penitentiary
can
do
to
keep
his
case
alive,
to
bring
it
on
for
hearing.
and
it
seems
to
us
that
it
is
especially
unseemly
for
the
state
to
take
this
position
when
they
have
resisted
his
attempts
to
get
this
case
in
the
court.
to
get
these
witnesses
evidence
before
the
judge
of
record.
now,
to
say
well
he
sat
on
his
hands.
i
think
the
record
bears
out
that
he
has
filed
one
habeas
corpus
after
another.
in
addition
to
that,
he
has
not
left
us
of
completely
dry
as
it
pertains
to
exactly
what
this
witness
experience
was.
he
did
obtain
an
affidavit
from
the
man
which
appears
at
page
33
of
our
appendix
wherein
mr.
orsucci
said,
“on
the
relevant
date,
i
was
confined
in
polk
county
jail.
i
saw
in
the
des
moines
register
a
news
item
saying
i
was
being
sought
for
witness.”
he
tells
that
he
has
to
note
to
the
turn
key
wanted
to
be
let
out,
and
pass
the
note
for
the
judge.
his
requests
were
denied
and
he
was
never
served
with
subpoena.
now,
the
idea
of
prosecutorial
knowledge
--
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
no,
there
was
not
your
honor.
his
particular
position
in
the
trial
of
the
case
is
not
much
referred
to
and
we
have
our
ideas
of
how
it
would
have
been
used
and
i
think
he
certainly
was
a
key
figure
in
this
whole
thing.
he'd
been
arrested
for
this
murder
and
clearly
i
think
the
defense
wanted
him
to
point
out
that
the
state's
witnesses
down
there
in
burlington,
the
place
of
the
trial
had
identified
him
as
being
one
of
the
man
implicated
and
he
would
have
very
clearly
undercut
their
credibility
had
he
been
produced,
i
think.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
pardon
me,
your
honor?
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
at
burlington,
iowa
your
honor
is
where
my
petitioner
was
tried.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
well,
there
were
two
witnesses
in
burlington
at
the
scene
who
had
identified
my
petitioner
and
one
of
them
apparently
made
an
identification
of
this
mr.
orsucci
as
well
which
prove
to
be
erroneous.
now
--
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
that
is
precisely
right
your
honor,
that's
exactly
what
the
law
provided.
now,
prosecutorial
knowledge
place
a
great
role
or
lack
there
of
in
connection
with
a
second
development
in
this
trial.
there
was
introduced
we
contend
false
documents,
false
notes
against
the
petitioner.
the
state
penitentiary
at
fort
madison
and
i
think
this
is
undisputed
was
a
great
focus
for
the
prosecutor
to
be
investigating
before
the
trial.
the
evidence
on
both
sides
--
oh!
excuse
me.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
thank
you
very
much
your
honor.
may
it
please
the
court.
your
honors,
at
the
conclusion
remarks
yesterday,
counsel
had
mentioned
that
the
iowa
state
penitentiary
of
fort
madison
had
prior
to
my
client's
trial
become
the
focus
of
investigation
by
the
prosecuting
attorney's
office.
he
had
interviewed
prisoners
there
but
what
they
might
know
about
mr.
johnson,
what
they
have
been
able
to
find
out
and
so
forth.
two
prisoners
ultimately
came
up
with
a
report
admissions
made
by
mr.
johnson
to
this
offense,
oral
admissions
as
well
as
notes
which
were
introduced
at
the
trial
at
state's
exhibits
number
1
and
2.
these
notes
sought
to
portray
the
prisoner
in
this
case
is
a
man
seeking
to
cook
up
an
alibi
to
the
record.
the
prisoner
said
that
they
got
the
notes
when
my
client
was
trying
to
smuggle
them
outside
the
penitentiary.
now,
these
notes
were
also
validated
at
trial
by
a
handwriting
expert
called
by
the
state.
this
handwriting
expert
said
that
mr.
johnson
who
was
required
to
print
this
card,
handwriting
exemplar
card
was
the
same
hand
who
had
printed
the
two
notes.
now,
on
later
years
your
honor,
mr.
johnson
in
about
1960
was
able
to
send
these
three
exhibits
to
a
handwriting
expert
who
was
a
leading
authority
in
this
country
on
the
subject.
this
man
made
a
detailed
examination
of
the
handwriting
on
the
exemplar
card
detailed
analysis
of
that
appearing
on
the
two
notes
and
he
concluded
that
the
original
trial
testimony
was
completely
wrong.
that
the
notes
were
not
written
by
mr.
johnson,
that
they
were
in
fact
apparently
forged
notes.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
they
are
printed
in
the
appendix
your
honor
but
in
this
form,
they
are
not.
they
do
appear
with
the
exhibits
that
we
have
sent
to
the
court
however.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes,
it
did
although
for
reasons
that
i'll
mention
we
were
not
able
to
present
any
handwriting
analysis
of
our
own,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes.
and
that
was
presented
by
the
state.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
the
sample
used
was
a
printed
card,
your
honor
which
is
introduced
in
evidence
in
--
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes,
that's
very
important
your
honor.
in
other
words,
our
handwriting
known
sample
is
the
1934
handwriting
of
mr.
johnson,
the
very
same
that
was
used
to
this
trial.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes,
there
was
a
mr.
foxen
called
by
the
state.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes,
he
did,
your
honor.
he
said
that
--
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
that's
right.
they
say
the
opinion
at
that
time
was
erroneous.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
it
is
perhaps
significant
your
honor
that
in
connection
with
other
evidence
in
the
case,
my
client
received
notice
of
that
about
two
months
before
trial.
the
prosecution
had
these
notes
in
july.
our
trial
was
in
november.
on
this
evidence,
notice
was
served
six
days
before
the
trial.
not
on
the
petitioner's
attorneys
but
upon
the
petitioner
in
his
jai
cell.
he
hurriedly
wrote
his
lawyers
telling
them
that
there
was
some
notes
that
are
going
to
be
introduced,
didn't
even
have
copies.
all
he
had
was
a
notice
that
this
was
going
to
be
used
against
him.
the
lawyer
got
down
after
he
got
the
letter
one
day
in
advance
the
trial
still
no
copies
just
the
notice
and
some
notes
would
be
used.
there
was
no
opportunity
afforded
for
the
defense.
as
far
as
i
can
see
to
give
this
evidence
the
kind
of
scrutiny
which
would
have
revealed
its
falsity.
well,
the
serving
of
that
notice
may
have
been
technically
correct.
we
question
the
propriety
seeing
that
the
genesis
of
these
notes
was
penitentiary
inmates.
in
not
affording
the
defense
and
opportunity
to
give
this
careful
screening
--
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
no,
i
think
not
perhaps
your
honor.
i
think
what
we
would
have
been
able
to
establish
is
that
those
two
prisoners
were
not
giving
honest
testimony.
the
ones
who
produced
the
notes
because
these
notes
had
to
been
printed
by
someone,
the
current
evidence
says
mr.
johnson
did
not
print
those
notes
and
i
think
inferentially
from
the
record,
it
appears
that
perhaps
these
two
prisoners
who
produced
them
or
someone
that
they
were
working
with
perhaps
printed
it.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
that
leaves
us
right
here
your
honor.
i
think
in
pyle
versus
kansas,
a
point
was
made
that
if
false
evidence
comes
into
the
case,
even
though
the
prosecutor
does
not
know
about
it.
if
that's
--
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
i
think
it
comes
down
to
whose
opinion
is
correct,
your
honor.
i
think
if
the
opinion
today
is
correct
then
we
submit
it
is
and
state
has
had
this
now
examined
by
their
own
expert
here
very
currently.
at
the
state
very
few
investigation,
he
said,
it
is
--
this
expert
says
it
is
correct.
mr.
johnson
did
not
write
these
notes.
and
his
report
--
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
in
the
trial
brief,
the
state
said
we
can
see
that
the
introduction
of
these
notes
were
error.
but
we
simply
say
that
it
didn't
form
material
part
of
the
case.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes,
i
think
that's
true.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
i
think
that's
true
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
no,
there
was
no
defense
opinion
that
was
mastered
at
that
time.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
just
a
denial,
right.
and
this
denial
was
done
by
a
prisoner
named
mr.
yates,
who
said
for
the
defendant
those
notes
were
fictitious.
those
notes
were
false.
i
told
the
prosecuting
attorney
they
were
false.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes,
that
was
before
the
jury
at
the
original
trial.
the
same
prisoner
also
said
that
he
received
a
monetary
offer
of
$25.00
to
assist
by
providing
evidence
or
the
names
of
witnesses
against
the
defendant.
stating
at
page
109
of
our
appendix
or
excuse
me,
page
107,
your
honors,
was
anything
talked
about
any
money
of
any
kind.
well,
mr.
daley
offered
me
$25.00
to
name
the
defense
witnesses.
and
if
we
turn
over
to
the
prosecutor's
closing
argument
on
110,
he
says,
before
i
go
into
that
i
want
to
say
the
state
would
have
been
glad
to
have
paid
yates
$25.00
to
get
the
names
of
the
alibi
witnesses.
now,
we
don't
suggest
that
this
reference
is
absolutely
clear.
but
it
is
perhaps
suggestive
of
a
climate
which
may
have
been
created
the
penitentiary
for
the
production
of
this
kind
of
evidence
which
the
current
expert
opinion
is
was
not
correct.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
he
was
your
honor.
now,
when
this
notice
was
served
on
him
just
on
the
eve
of
trial
he'd
been
transferred
up
to
a
county
jail
at
that
time
but
he
was
in
the
man
in
the
penitentiary.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
they
were
the
very
same
persons,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
same
source
of
testimony
in
both
cases.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
they
were
vigorously
objected
to.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes,
your
honor.
could
i
locate
that
and
i'm
reserving
some
time.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
in
addition
to
the
burdens
of
the
suppressed
witness
and
what
we
contend
is
false
evidence,
our
petitioner
here
was
required,
your
honors,
to
bear
one
further
burden
and
that
was
the
burden
of
proof
on
a
lead
issue
in
this
case.
the
issue
of
whether
the
prisoner
was
at
burlington,
iowa
or
in
des
moines,
165
miles
away
at
the
time
of
the
offense
in
question.
now,
he
presented
here
a
very
strong
alibi
defense.
he
called
the
owner
of
a
gas
station
who
had
filled
his
tank
in
des
moines
that
morning
about
the
time
the
homicide
occurred,
165
miles
away.
he
traded
there
for
about
a
year
and
this
appears
to
be
an
independent
witness,
no
particular
acts
to
(inaudible).
but
later
that
morning,
the
owner
of
the
cigar
counter
said,
“mr.
johnson
was
in.
his
father
was
here
and
bought
a
cigar.”
i'm
not
asking
the
court
here
to
retry
these
facts
but
i'm
simply
raising
the
point
that
a
strong
alibi
defense
was
presented.
several
witnesses,
many
of
them
independent
placed
my
client
in
the
city
of
des
moines
at
a
point
where
it
would
have
been
impossible
for
him
to
have
committed
this
murder
if
they
were
believed.
now,
the
trial
court
because
we
had
gone
ahead
and
called
witnesses
on
this
point
of
alibi,
instructed
the
jury
that
in
order
to
prevail
on
none
presence
at
the
scene,
the
defendant
was
required
to
prove
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that
he
was
elsewhere.
as
mr.
justice
brennan
pointed
out
in
speiser
versus
randall,
the
burden
of
proof
may
well
be
determinative
in
a
given
case
and
for
that
reason,
we
suggest
that
this
instruction
given
by
the
trial
court
as
well
as
the
references
by
the
prosecuting
attorney
which
appear
on
page
113
and
114
of
our
record
were
highly
detrimental
to
our
prisoner's
presumption
of
innocence
in
his
fair
trial
rights
in
this
case.
it
is
up
to
the
defense,
the
prosecutor
said,
the
burden
of
proof
of
alibi
and
they
have
to
prove
that.
the
court
will
instruct
you
that
they
have
to
prove
alibi.
again,
the
prosecutor
said,
“are
you
going
to
accept
the
alibi
of
pool-hall
hangers-on
and
friend
of
johnson
and
his
relation
when
the
man
himself
has
never
denied
it
under
oath?”
certainly,
he
tells
the
jury.
“certainly,
you
are
entitled
to
know
what
he
has
to
say
and
remember
the
burden
of
proof
of
alibi
rests
on
the
defense,
and
they
have
to
meet
that
burden.”
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
no,
there
was
not
at
this
time,
your
honor.
this
was
a
judicial
interpretation
that
it
brought
us
to
this
point.
later
on
iowa
enacted
a
statute
requiring
the
defendant
to
give
the
names
of
his
alibi
witnesses
in
advance.
but
that
is
not
involved
in
this
case.
now,
apparently
iowa
and
two
states
or
one
other
state,
iowa
and
georgia
observed
to
this
rule
and
every
federal
case
that
we've
been
able
to
discover
has
struck
down
charging
the
jury
that
the
defendant
has
the
burden
the
proof
on
this
lead
issue
in
the
case.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes,
it
held,
it
shetters
the
presumption
of
innocence
and
unfairly
penalizes
the
defendant.
your
honor,
since
you
asked
that
question,
i
should
mention
a
case
which
is
not
in
the
advance
sheets
yet
for
you.
this
is
a
very
recent
one,
state
of
iowa
versus
larry
carter
which
will
be
out
in
northwest
in
a
couple
of
weeks,
i
anticipate.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
larry
carter,
c-a-r-t-e-r
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
it
was
filed
october
15,
1968
and
on
the
point
of
what
is
the
law
in
iowa,
the
supreme
court
notes
that
this
case
is
before
the
court
and
suggest
the
matter
will
probably
be
decided
by
the
supreme
court
in
the
near
future
and
then
instructs
the
trial
courts
not
to
give
this
instruction
pending
any
disposition
this
court
might
make.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes,
there
was
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
the
objection
took
the
form
of
saying
that
the
instruction
violated
the
petitioner's
rights
and
that
it
disparage
alibi.
and
i'm
frank
to
admit
your
honor
that
the
fairly
complete
attack
i
think
that
we've
made
on
the
alibi
instruction
was
not
spread
on
this
exception.
but
it
was
not
a
case
where
the
trial
counsel
permitted
the
court
to
go
ahead
and
instruct
and
then
combed
the
record
later.
the
resistance
to
this
instruction
was
fully
put
on
record.
your
honors,
i
am
going
to
try
to
save
some
time
so
unless
there
is
question.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
thank
you
your
honor,
may
it
please
the
court.
your
honor,
the
age
of
the
petitioner
as
mr.
justice
black
asked
is
presently
63
years
old
and
i
understand
he
was
29
when
he
entered
the
penitentiary.
mr.
justice
marshall
has
suggested
that
the
effective
orsucci
on
the
jury
is
absolutely
incalculable
at
this
point.
i
think
that's
true
and
had
our
right
to
have
him
secured
as
a
witness
at
the
trial
then
vouchsafed
to
is,
your
honor,
that
there
would
be
no
problem
on
that.
it
is
in
fact
the
responsibility
of
the
state
that
this
was
not
done
and
we
suggest
there
responsibility
in
years
since.
well,
prior
to
the
time
that
mr.
orsucci
died
that
we
were
denied
a
hearing.
their
steady
resistances
to
our
applications
for
hearing
are
off
record.
in
1961,
we
appeared
in
the
district
court
in
the
southern
district
of
iowa,
raised
this
point,
raised
the
point
of
the
false
notes
and
again
we
were
denied
without
hearing,
again
this
was
resisted
by
the
state.
now,
the
witness
dies
in
1965,
the
respondent
says,
well,
you
didn't
preserve
his
testimony.
i
suggest
that
we
had
disabilities
in
preserving
that.
we
did
try
to
take
an
affidavit.
your
honor,
i
have
looked
at
that
california
deposition
and
in
connection
with
the
colloquy
on
that
point,
the
federal
district
court
at
the
time
he
ordered
this
california
deposition
made
clear
that
he
was
doing
it
only
because
the
witness
there,
the
deponent
was
out
of
state,
was
of
old
age
and
there
was
a
possibility
his
testimony
might
be
lost.
now
in
connection
with
the
notes,
the
point
has
been
made
here
that
the
notes
did
occupy
a
very
substantial
place
in
this
trial.
now,
the
trial
record
shows
that
over
40
pages
of
transcript
were
dedicated
on
the
part
of
state
evidence
to
these
notes.
in
addition,
we
urged
to
the
court
that
there
were
exhibits
1
and
2
at
the
original
trial.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
this
was
in
the
1934
trial
your
honor.
mr.
claerhout
suggests
that
because
we
were
able
to
put
on
the
stand
a
prisoner
from
the
state
penitentiary
who
said,
“mr.
prosecutor,
those
notes
were
fictitious,
you
knew
it
and
i
knew
it
and
i
told
you
that.”
that
somehow
now
we
had
destroyed
their
effect
on
the
jury.
this
overlooks
the
fact
that
we
were
not
able
to
generate
expert
testimony
at
that
time
and
the
state's
case
on
this
point
was
much
more
persuasive
at
the
time
of
this
original
trial.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
well,
the
view
of
--
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
this
is
why
i
mentioned
pyle
versus
kansas,
your
honor.
in
that
case,
the
lower
courts
have
all
taken
the
position.
curran
versus
delaware
is
a
good
example.
that
case
involves
no
knowledge
by
the
prosecutor
himself
of
perjured
testimony
and
yet
if
is
shown
to
be
material,
the
point
is
that
the
--
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
well,
i'm
suggesting
there's
evidence
in
this
record
that
this
prosecutor
was
told
this
evidence
was
false.
i'm
suggesting
--
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
that's
right.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
the
findings
are
against
me
on
that,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes,
sir.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
this
is
true
your
honor
but
we
were
denied
notice
of
this
evidence
until
the
very
eve
of
trial.
i
see
my
time
has
expired
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
yes,
i'll
be
glad
to
--
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
no,
i
believe
he
agrees
with
me
--
the
board
of
parole
has
no
authority
to
parole
a
life
--
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
i'm
not
aware
on
that
point
sir.
i
do
know
as
i
said
yesterday
that
he
is
being
considered
for
recommendation
at
the
present
time
but
what
the
--
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
for
commutation.
mr.
ronald
l.
carlson
if
there
are
further
questions,
your
honor?
if
not
let
me
thank
the
court
very
much.
