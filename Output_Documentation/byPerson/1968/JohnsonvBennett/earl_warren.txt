mr.

you
may
proceed
with
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
he
an
indigent
at
the
time
he
was
convicted?
do
you
know?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
i
understand
from
you
that
before
the
judge
issued
the
subpoena,
that
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
be
the
opinion
that
this
witness
was
necessary
to
the
defense?
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now
mr.
carlson.
chief
justice
earl
warren
number
32,
gale
h.
johnson,
petitioner
versus
john
e.
bennett,
warden.
mr.
carlson,
you
may
continue
with
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
were
these
two
prisoners
who
presented
these
notes
the
same
prisoners
who
testified
at
the
trial
that
he
had
--
that
the
prisoner
had
confessed
to
them
that
he
had
done
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
same
ones.
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
the
statute
on
that
necessity
of
proof?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may.
mr.
claerhout.
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
friday
night
before
the
sunday?
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
you,
did
the
state
attempt
to
discredit
those
witnesses?
his
witnesses,
alibi
witnesses?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
there
were
others
were
they
not
like
the
gasoline
station
man
and
so
forth,
with
the
close
associate?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
that
sheriff
testify
in
any
of
the
habeas
corpus
hearings
issued
that
since?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
he
living?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
he
living?
chief
justice
earl
warren
sure.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
how
about
the
man,
the
sheriff
who
testified
originally?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
there
a
hearing
ever
requested
on
that
issue?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
i
wonder
if
a
witness
testified
that
both
identified,
both
orsucci
and
johnson
as
they
did
in
this
case,
isn't
that
right?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
the
defense
could
present
a
witness
who
would
totally
discredit
that
testimony
so
far
as
orsucci
was
concerned.
do
you
not
believe
that
that
would
have
anything
to
do
with
the
credibility
of
that
witness's
testimony
in
the
trial?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
but
you
don't
think
if
it
was
established
that
they
were
entirely
wrong
about
orsucci
in
the
testimony
that
that
would
have
any
effect
upon
the
correctness
of
their
identification
of
johnson?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
they
didn't
say
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
didn't
say
that.
they
said
both
of
these
men
were
there.
and
the
defendant
represents
a
man
who
let
us
assume
could
establish
that
he
was
not
the
one,
the
second
man
that
they
identified.
do
you
not
think
that
that
would
discredit,
have
a
tendency
to
discredit
their
entire
testimony?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
we
stated,
i
will
stick
to
that
one
witness.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
mr.
orsucci
could
have
been
if
he
had
been
given
a
hearing,
mr.
orsucci
could
have
been
present
there
as
a
witness,
couldn't
he?
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
would
--
he
couldn't'
take
the
deposition
of
mr.
orsucci
if
he
was
in
des
moines,
was
he
and
subject
to
subpoena?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
do
you
then
--
in
your
state
practice,
can
the
defendant
take
a
deposition
of
any
witness
he
wants
whether
he's
subject
to
the
subpoena
power
or
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
ruggles
was
in
california?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
but
what
i'm
--
what
i
was
asking
is
this,
in
a
criminal
case
or
in
a
habeas
corpus
case,
if
the
witnesses
are
all
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court,
does
a
defendant
have
the
right
to
go
out
and
take
their
depositions
before
the
hearing
in
court?
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
the
hearing
below,
did
the
state
put
on
any
testimony,
any
expert
testimony
to
counteract
the
testimony
of
the
petitioner
that
these
were
forged?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
is
this
original
handwriting
expert
who
testified
that
these
were
the
writing
of
the
defendant,
is
he
still
living?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
don't
know
why
the
state
didn't
use
him,
again,
to
show
that
this
was
actually
the
handwriting
of
the
petitioner.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
does
the
state
concede
that
those
were
forged?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
before
you
get
to
that,
on
just
what
as
justice
marshall
has
presented
to
you,
this
is
an
almost
a
clear
concession
that
they
were
not,
these
notes
were
not
the
documents
signed
or
written
by
the
petitioner,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
says
the
examination
has
been
made
of
the
above
described
material
as
requested.
and
we
have
compared
the
known
specimen
of
printing
with
the
two
items
in
question.
it
has
been
concluded
and
there's
the
opinion
of
the
examiner
that
gale
johnson
whose
known
printing
appears
on
specimen
k-1
is
not
responsible
for
the
printing
on
specimens
q-1
and
q-2
and
that's
signed
by
the
director
of
the
ohio
bureau
of
criminal
investigation
and
you
vouched
for
that
in
putting
it
into
evidence
so
the
state
does
vouch
for
the
fact
that
this
is
not
the
handwriting
of
the
petitioner,
isn't
that
correct?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
more
could
they
have
than
expert
opinion?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
don't
doubt
do
you
that
this
evidence
of
these
two
notes
was
highly
pressed
initial
to
the
defendant?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
you
say
they
were
believed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that
was
a
non-expert
witness
who
said
that
it
wasn't.
chief
justice
earl
warren
who
has
that
third
opinion?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
what
level
has
the
third?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no
--
finish
your
statement.
chief
justice
earl
warren
