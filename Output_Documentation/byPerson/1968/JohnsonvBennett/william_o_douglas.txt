justice

--
this
issue
of
handwriting
came
up
with
the
trial
did
it,
the
original
trial?
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
at
the
original
trial,
there
was
a
handwriting
analysis?
justice
william
o.
douglas
and
what
were
the
samples
used
at
that
time?
justice
william
o.
douglas
so
these
are
the
same
--
i
mean
the
same
comparison;
the
same
documents
were
compared
at
the
habeas
hearing
as
it
were
at
the
original
trial?
justice
william
o.
douglas
now,
there
was
a
handwriting
expert
who
testified
it
to
recent
trial?
justice
william
o.
douglas
and
he
testified
that
the
handwriting
on
both
were
the
same,
did
he?
justice
william
o.
douglas
now,
what
and
now
we
have
new
set
of
experts
who
33
years
later,
whatever
time,
will
now
say,
no
on
their
analysis,
it
is
not
the
same.
justice
william
o.
douglas
is
that
right?
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
was
there
any
suggestion
that
it
was
deliberately
false
with
the
expert
of
that
time,
testified
both?
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
are
you
suggesting
that
perhaps
had
you
have
more
opportunity,
you
might
have
been
able
to
establish
that
the
handwriting
expert
was
indeed
not
giving
honest
testimony,
is
that
what
you
suggest?
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
assuming
that
the
handwriting
expert
was
honestly
giving
his
expert
opinion
that
this
was
the
same
handwriting.
where
does
that
leave
us?
justice
william
o.
douglas
my
whole
point
is
how
would
you
say
it
was
false,
if
that
was
honest,
expert
opinion
merely
based
upon
the
fact
that
later
other
handwriting
experts
also
gave
honest
opinion
that
to
the
contrary
that
it
was
not?
justice
william
o.
douglas
so
you
mean
in
effect
that
these
comes
to
us
then
with
a
virtually
stipulation
on
the
part
of
the
state
that
these
were
not
written
by
this
defendant?
justice
william
o.
douglas
thank
you.
justice
william
o.
douglas
my
hearing
was
requested
in
the
district
court
and
the
district
court
denied
habeas
corpus
without
a
hearing,
is
that
right?
