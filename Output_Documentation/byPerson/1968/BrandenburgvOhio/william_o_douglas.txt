i
don't
understand
your
point
that,
nobody

the
audience
was
being
people
of
members
of
the
group
were
being
addressed,
i
don't
see
the
relevance.
the
reason
i
asked
that
is
in
the
dennis
case,
dennis
versus
united
states,
involving
the
prosecution
of
communist
teachers
who
talked
the
marxist
creed.
nobody
was
exposed
except
the
students
in
the
classroom.

if
the

can
take
judicial
notice
that
the

conspiratorial
out

why
couldn't
the

take
notice
that
the
klan
is
up
to
no
good?

i
think
this
may
be
taken
some
liberties
help

it

douglas
of
your
brief
that,
“we
are
marching

the

four
hundred

seems
to
tie
this
group
into
a
rather
big
national
movement.

then
they
go
on
and
they
say,
“the
jewish
should
go
back

and

should
go

the
whole
program
seems
to
be
pretty
clear.
