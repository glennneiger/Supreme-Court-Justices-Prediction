justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
brown,
i
gather
the
indictment
however
was
for
the
events,
is
that
right?
was
the
events
depicted
in
the
film,
not
for
the
exhibition
on
the
film,
was
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words,
all
the
film
was
in
evidence
was
depicting
what
happened
on
a
certain
day.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that's
because
of
what
happened,
it
was
alleged
that
there
been
a
violation
of
statutes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
was,
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that
i
gather,
if
we're
to
read
to
the
record
of
the
case.
we
have
to
see
the
film,
though,
to
know
what
the
truth
were
that

justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
that
doesn't
help
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
that's
why
i
asked
you
earlier,
the
indictment
was
for
the
events
depicted.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
not
for
the
showing
and
the
motion
that
your
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
the
context
of
conspiracy
or
anything
else.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
just
what
happened
in
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
my
next
question.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
think
its
on
page
5
of
your
brief.
justice
