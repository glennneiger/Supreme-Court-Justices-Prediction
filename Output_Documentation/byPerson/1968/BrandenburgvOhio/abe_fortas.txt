justice
abe
fortas
did
this
appellant
have
anything
to
do
with
arranging
for
the
events
to
be
televised?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
if
that
is
so
then
its
pretty
--
then
it's
debatable
whether
this
was
addressed
only
to
the
people
who
were
physically
there.
justice
abe
fortas
(voice
overlap)
yes,
if
he
had
arranged
the
court
--
justice
abe
fortas
but
they
have
arranged
before
it
to
be
televised
presumably
he
intended
that
his
remarks
reached
a
larger
audience.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
brown,
we
don't
have
anywhere
a
complete
transcript
of
what
was
said
in
the
film
either,
do
we?
justice
abe
fortas
where
is
that?
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
all?
that's
not
all
that
we
assume
because
--
justice
abe
fortas
no
--
no,
i
mean
to
say,
is
there
anywhere
were
we
can
look
and
see
what
--
what's
in
that
film
from
the
first
word
to
the
last
word?
there's
one
thing
to
read
these
things,
an
excerpt
is
taken
here
and
that's
not
maybe
quite
another
thing
to
read
it
consecutively.
justice
abe
fortas
does
that
appear
anywhere?
justice
abe
fortas
where?
justice
abe
fortas
now
--
now,
is
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
you
mean,
as
the
--
on
pages
5
and
6,
can
we
read
that
and
after
we
read
that,
do
we
have
the
full
text
of
the
transcript
of
the
film.
you
give
me
what
the
first
word
and
the
last
word.
justice
abe
fortas
now,
what
about
--
now
--
justice
abe
fortas
alright
now,
how
about
the
second?
justice
abe
fortas
and
i
take
it
that
the
state's
position
is
that
the
advocacy
in
the
form
that
it
took
demonstrated
by
this
film
constitutes
a
violation
of
the
criminal
syndicalism
act,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
well
recently,
if
that
so
were
the
people
or
the
network
people
to
use
that
vague
phrase
violating
your
law
too?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
is
there
is
any
evidence
in
here
rather
than
the
film
itself
and
the
network
arrangements
that
mr.
brandenburg
intended
to
bring
about
violence?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
as
your
--
well,
i
suppose
that
can
be
said
that
there
is
no
question
that
he
intended
to
advocate,
whatever
he
advocated
here.
but
the
next
question
is,
do
you
have
to
have
some
additional
proof
to
the
effect
that
he
also
intended
that
steps
be
taken
to
carry
out
this
program
with
respect
to
the
negroes
and
the
jews
and
so
on
that
he
described?
justice
abe
fortas
so,
those
words
would
carry
on
the
network,
why
wasn't
that
a
violation
of
your
law?
that's
that
the
question
that
started
over.
justice
abe
fortas
that's
right.
justice
abe
fortas
and
i
ask
you
again
whether
there
is
any
proof
of
that
other
than
the
utterance
of
words
and
the
arrangements
for
the
network
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
on
your
case
you
don't
have
to
demonstrate
that
it
says
stupidity,
do
you?
justice
abe
fortas
did
this
appellant
have
anything
to
do
with
arranging
for
the
events
to
be

justice
