mr.
allen
brown
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court.
we
have
before
us
case
arising
in
the
state
of
ohio
under
a
conviction
under
ohio's
criminal
syndicalism
act.
we
have
indeed
before
us
something
of
rarity.
it
is
as
far
as
i
know
a
third
case
ever
tried
under
ohio's
criminal
syndicalism
act
and
the
first
to
ever
reach
the
appellate
level.
i
--
there
was
earlier
in
ohio
when
their
peculiar
proceedings
in
which
a
prosecutor
could
bring
a
proceeding
before
the
supreme
court
on
appeal
for
a
question
of
law
only.
a
proceeding
in
which
--
a
motion
was
made
in
the
lower
court
in
ohio,
attacking
the
constitutionality
of
ohio's
criminal
syndicalism
law.
the
lower
court
in
ohio
held
the
law
to
be
unconstitutional.
it
was
appealed
to
the
supreme
court
in
state
versus
kassay
and
in
what
is
basically
in
advisory
opinion.
the
court
stated
that
it
was
constitutional.
if
the
court
also
stated
several
engaging
other
things.
it
stated
that
the
first
amendment
did
not
apply
to
the
states
of
the
union.
it
also
stated
that
the
measure
of
its
application
was
an
issue
in
its
constitutionality
and
it
would
attend
the
first
trial
of
a
case
to
see
what
is
the
proper
measure
of
its
application.
the
court
waited
patiently
for
the
first
application
to
a
case
that
arose
some
40
years
later
in
this
case
and
surprisingly
despite
the
invitation
here
sent
out
in
kassay,
the
court
declined
to
even
hear
his
constitutional
question
on
the
application
in
this
case.
it
in
fact
defaulted
to
this
court,
ohio's
privilege
are
setting
forth
the
limitations
of
the
application
of
its
statute.
ohio's
privileges
are
setting
forth
potentiality
of
clarification
and
delineation
of
a
statute
which
obviously
on
its
face
rushes
head
long
into
the
first
amendment.
these
are
the
facts
in
this
case.
a
television
reporter
receives
a
telephone
call
indicating
that
if
he
wanted
to
he
could
come
and
take
movies
of
a
ku
klux
klan
meeting.
he
came.
he
met
some
hooded
figures
and
arrangements
were
made
for
the
taking
of
a
movie.
a
movie
was
taken
in
which
a
cross
was
burned,
some
figures
milled
about,
and
yelled
some
stupid
and
rather,
a
senseless
slogans
and
then
a
single
figure
was
panned
on,
and
he
made
a
speech,
a
speech
full
of
conditions,
precedents,
and
reservations,
hyperbola
self-evidently
stupid
and
silly.
the
--he
asserted
that
the
clan
was
the
largest
organization
in
the
state
of
ohio.
he
then
went
on
in
a
--
with
a
condition
precedent
that
if
the
various
branch
is
the
government
including
this
court,
do
not
mend
their
ways
that
revengeance,
a
word
of
his
own
coining
i
assume
would
be
taken.
he
did
not
specify
the
revengeance
and
we
do
not
know
what
particular
aspect
of
the
democratic
process
he
was
going
to
involve
himself
in
revengeance.
he
then
spoke
of
a
march
not
in
identifying
it
as
an
armed
march
or
any
sort
of
march
of
any
force
or
violence
into
washington
and
then
into
two
southern
states,
incidentally,
raising
federal
questions
perhaps
rather
than
internal
state
questions.
another
film
taken
is
inside
the
house
--
mr.
allen
brown
there
were
guns
in
both
films.
mr.
allen
brown
in
both
films.
there
were
guns.
it
is
also
to
be
noted
that
the
film
was
taken
on
a
remote,
private
farm
in
which
apparently
there
is
no
evidence
whatsoever
that
these
people
were
not
invitees
present
on
that
farm
by
authority
of
the
ownership
of
the
farm.
there
was
nothing,
nothing
adduce
an
indictment
was
returned,
i
have
to
some
preliminary
move,
maneuvering
including
a
frontal
attack
on
the
constitutionality
of
a
statute.
the
case
came
on
to
trial.
the
state
produced
nothing
but
the
film
in
question.
the
only
other
evidence
that
the
state
produced
was
basically
geared
to
identifying
the
personnel
involved
in
the
film.
in
other
words,
showing
that
the
man
brandenburg
had
a
gun
similar
to
the
guns
in
the
film
and
that
he
had
markings
on
his
person
similar
to
the
markings
and
that
his
voice
was
similar.
other
than
this,
the
state
offered
nothing.
it
is
critical
that
the
state
offered
nothing
on
the
nature
and
history
of
the
klan.
it
offered
nothing
showing
that
the
course
of
the
klan's
history
any
continuing
historical
or
expert
opinions
concerning
any
possible
commitment
to
violence.
it
offered
nothing
on
the
continuing
organization
of
the
klan,
nothing
whatsoever.
it
offered
nothing
other
than
the
film
itself
and
the
words
intrinsic
in
the
film
itself.
the
state
then
rests
the
defense
in
which
i
was
not
involved.
i'm
appoint
of
counsel
--
appointed
for
purposes
of
appeal.
made
a
motion
for
dismissal
at
that
time,
i
will
frankly
admit
that
the
motion
for
dismissal
which
was
made
by
then
counsel
was
simply
our
weight
of
evidence
motion
and
he
did
not
specifically
denote
the
constitutional
question
that
had
arisen
at
that
point
in
the
presentation
of
the
state's
case.
i
suggest
that
it
is
completely
immaterial
but
he
did
not.
the
defense
then
preceded
forward
and
offered
basically
a
defense
of
the
positive
testimony
in
which
various
members
--
officers
of
the
klan
testified
as
to
their
ostensible
peaceful
purposes
and
things
of
this
sort
and
the
historical
evaluations
of
the
presence
of
weapons
and
the
burning
of
a
cross.
the
court
then
charged
the
jury.
the
court's
charged
the
jury
and
i
specifically
asked
this
court
to
consider
it
carefully.
begins
in
the
appendix
at
page

and
met
with
the
statute
that
thrust
itself
clearly
within
the
first
amendment
makes
on
its
face
no
attempt
to
give
us
a
life
indication
of
a
line
demarcation
between
the
mere
abstract
teaching
in
advocacy
or
even
advocacy
in
relation
to
a
clear
and
present
danger
as
to
advocacy
in
a
hypothetical
sense.
that
in
no
way
on
its
face
does
this.
the
court
perpetuated
the
evil
of
the
statute
by
making
the
charge
even
more
general,
in
which
he
indeed
define
the
term
advocacy
as
involving
intrinsic
in
it
in
his
own
charge.
teaching,
so
that
we
have
at
this
point
a
man
who
had
been
tried
with
none
of
the
safeguards
of
the
first
amendment
applied
to
the
trial
of
his
cause
to
the
measure
of
his
evidence
or
to
the
instructions
to
those
who
worked
to
be
the
triers
of
the
fact
which
would
demarcate
the
point
at
which
the
first
amendment
would
be
operative
in
relation
to
what
happen
on
that
isolated
farm
on
that
isolated
day.
mr.
allen
brown
the
pictures,
the
testimony
and
the
pictures
indicate
that
perhaps
20
persons
were
involved.
mr.
allen
brown
no
spectators.
all
were
participants
in
the
meeting.
there
is
some
indication
of
the
record
that
there
were
no
woman
folk
in
the
picture
or
in
the
meeting.
there
are
some
testimonies
in
the
record
that
one
of
the
tv
reporters
said
he
heard,
women's
voices
in
another
room.
i
know
nothing
else
about
the
woman
folk
in
that
occasion.
mr.
allen
brown
pardon,
your
honor?
mr.
allen
brown
the
film
is
an
exhibit.
mr.
allen
brown
i
pray
it
is.
i
have
so
ordered
it
and
at
my
last
words
from
the
clerk
was
that
they
were
having
trouble
finding
it
but
they
would
find
it
and
send
it
on
up
here.
i
devoutly
pray
because
we
do
have
in
this
case
some
issues
as
to
what
is
shown
in
the
film
and
since
--
mr.
allen
brown
yes.
mr.
allen
brown
there
is
a
distinct
dispute.
it
is
our
contention
that
there
was
nothing
in
the
speech
which
is
part
of
the
record
and
it
is
shown
in
the
film
and
since
the
state
limited
itself
to
this.
there
is
nothing
in
it
that
is
a
called
twice
--
mr.
allen
brown
i
assume
my
adversary
disputes
that.
mr.
allen
brown
that's
correct.
mr.
allen
brown
and
the
language
of
the
film
is
actually
in
both
parties'
briefs.
the
difference
between
us
is
that
they
tend
to
ascribe
certain
slogans
by
the
person's
billing
about
to
the
given
defendant.
we
contend
that
the
only
words
that
the
given
defendant
are
ordered
with
the
formal
set
of
speeches.
mr.
allen
brown
this
film
was
shown
over
a
local
television
station
and
a
network.
mr.
allen
brown
that's
correct.
mr.
allen
brown
judge
simon
leis.
does
it
ring
any
bells,
judge?
mr.
allen
brown
okay.
mr.
allen
brown
that
is
correct.
mr.
allen
brown
that
is
correct.
mr.
allen
brown
that's
correct.
the
act
of
showing
it
over
television
which
entered
the
plea
and
intervening
parties,
the
authorities
running
the
television
station
are
not
the
basis
of
the
indictment
--
mr.
allen
brown
--
and
the
charge.
mr.
allen
brown
precisely.
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
the
supreme
court
of
ohio,
we
didn't
raise
it
here
because
we
wanted
to
see
if
we
can
make
sure
that
we
get
assert
--
we
asserted
that
the
film
was
in
the
same
position
as
a
book
in
an
obscenity
case.
mr.
allen
brown
i
know
it
doesn't
help
us
now
but
at
that
point
when
we
before
the
supreme
court
of
ohio,
we
have
asserted
that
saying
that
the
film
in
and
of
itself
is
the
entire
context
of
the
alleged
offense.
mr.
allen
brown
may
it
please
the
court.
there
is
this
important
distinction
to
be
made
between
the
dennis
case
and
that
case.
in
the
dennis
case,
the
teachers
who
taught
these
classes,
this
was
evidence
within
a
total
context
of
a
total
conspiratorial
activity
leading
to
a
total
action
result.
in
this
instance,
the
state
contented
itself
merely
was
showing
a
given
speech
and
did
not
choose
to
present
any
evidence
to
make
it
part
of
a
conspiratorial
whole.
it
took
the
speech
in
and
of
itself
that
represented
only
--
mr.
allen
brown
that
is
correct.
mr.
allen
brown
that
is
correct.
mr.
allen
brown
that's
correct.
mr.
allen
brown
what
happened
on
that
farm
on
that
day
and
that
is
the
important
distinction
to
be
made.
mr.
allen
brown
there
is
evidence
in
the
record
that
indicate
that
his
was
the
voice
that
called
the
radio,
tv
announcement.
mr.
allen
brown
that
maybe
the
case
judge
--
justice
fortas.
mr.
allen
brown
i
think
that
however
the
state
of
ohio
chose
not
to
charge
him
for
that.
mr.
allen
brown
it's
quite
potentially
possible.
this
is
however
not
what
the
state
chose
to
charge
him
on,
read
the
indictment
and
--
mr.
allen
brown
in
the
dennis
case,
i
submit
that
the
court
did
not
take
such
judicial
notice.
that
in
the
dennis
case
as
a
matter
fact,
there
was
the
adoption
of
evidence
to
show
that.
mr.
allen
brown
but
in
any
event
--
mr.
allen
brown
in
any
event,
it
is
clear
that
in
the
dennis
case
there
was
additional
evidence
other
--
over
and
above
that
adduce
in
this
case.
in
this
case,
they
showed
nothing
but
the
film
itself.
they
showed
no
other
plan
or
purposively
other
than
that.
mr.
allen
brown
that
is
a
potential
distinction
between
this
case
and
the
dennis
case
as
well.
these
are
paltry
unknown
rather
silly
characters.
in
the
dennis
case,
we're
dealing
with
the
established
leadership
of
a
national
organization.
this
does
make
a
difference
in
relation
to
the
rights
prevailing
under
the
first
amendment.
the
--
but
in
this
given
case,
there
are
other
distinctions
which
i'll
pass
to
in
a
moment.
in
this
given
case,
we
are
dealing
with
a
statute
which
on
its
very
face
thrust
itself
into
the
first
amendment.
we
are
dealing
in
this
situation,
not
with
an
address
to
an
evil
from
which
we
must
move
back
to
a
possible
restraint
upon
first
amendment
for
there's
a
dealing
with
an
entry
particularly
into
the
right
and
then
a
prescription
upon
the
right
as
it
might
engender
an
evil.
for
instance,
the
statute
starts
off.
no
person
shall
by
word
of
mouth
or
writing
at
the
gate
or
teach
the
duty
and
goes
on
from
that
point.
it
denotes
first
amendment
here
we
come.
it
does
not
say
that
no
person
shall
not
advocate
or
teach
the
duty
and
necessity
of
propriety
of
crime.
it
does
not
then
become
so
broad
that
it
could
possibly
take
symbolic
acts
or
acting
out
that
go
beyond
mere
words
of
mouth
and
printing.
it
announces
wholly,
here
we
come
first
amendment
and
proceeds
from
that
point
on
advocate
or
teach.
now,
the
prosecution
in
this
case
has
said
that
the
issue
of
teach
is
not
involved
here
because
the
man
was
charged
only
under
advocacy
but
if
the
distinctions
between
teaching
an
advocacy
was
so
simplistic,
we
would
have
a
very
simple
solution
in
this
case.
but
as
a
teacher,
who
teaches
in
the
first
grade
that
the
american
revolution
was
a
noble
thing,
is
she
merely
teaching
or
is
she
advocating?
the
lines
of
demarcation
between
teaching
an
advocacy
are
so
difficult
that
they
leave
us
vulnerable
when
we
charged
advocacy
alone.
in
order
to
reserve
a
portion
of
my
time
for
rebuttal,
i
would
like
to
point
out
however,
what
i
think
is
the
most
absurd
aspect
of
this
particular
statute.
it
also
forbids
not
only
speech
or
printing.
it
becomes
very,
very
evasive
on
the
whole
question
of
intent
scienter
and
mens
rea,
think
carefully.
it
comes
very,
very
unclear
on
the
whole
area
of
willfulness
except
for
occasional
phrase
in
multiplicity
of
phrases.
in
addition
to
which,
it
forbids
the
assembly
with
any
group
and
it
forbids
not
only
membership
by
problem
that
is
been
before
this
court.
not
only
affiliation
of
problem
to
this
court
but
indeed
even
forbids
seating
down
with
such
group
in
an
error
in
which
they
are
trying
to
preserve
the
dialogue
benefits
to
society
of
the
first
amendment.
it
is
incredible
that
the
legislature
of
ohio
forbids
us
even
to
seat
down.
mr.
allen
brown
that's
correct.
mr.
allen
brown
i
certainly
would
prefer
that
you
did,
however
--
mr.
allen
brown
this
court
could
potentially
strike
this
down,
not
merely
on
the
instruction
but
indeed
on
the
face
of
the
record
that
it
is
not
constitutionality
sufficient
to
constitute
an
offense.
mr.
allen
brown
on
the
evidence.
this
court
has
those
alternatives,
i
cannot
escape.
mr.
allen
brown
however,
i
offer
this
posture
that
the
defendant
in
this
cause
asserted
that
he
was
not
tried
by
a
motion
to
quash
the
indictment
and
at
this
court
perhaps
must
assume
his
posture
and
find
that
he
should
never
had
been
brought
to
trial
into
that
--
under
those
circumstances.
mr.
allen
brown
what's
before
you
in
the
entire
--
mr.
allen
brown
i
don't
from
work
--
mr.
allen
brown
--
the
intake.
mr.
allen
brown
this
is
our
brief
your
honor.
mr.
allen
brown
may
it
please
the
court.
let
me
several
things
concerning
--
mr.
allen
brown
how
do
we
know
this
is
a
program?
how
do
we
know
--
mr.
allen
brown
if
you
believe
what
the
speaker
says,
this
absurd
hyperbola
is
a
program.
however,
the
program
is
a
program
of
ostensible
social
reform
but
does
not
necessarily
indicate
on
the
face
of
his
remarks
an
intent
to
violence
or
to
commit
a
crime.
i
agree
with
the
court,
it
is
assert
--
mr.
allen
brown
i
assume
that
he's
offering
this.
i
agree
that
he
--
we
are
operating
within
an
absurd
premise.
indeed,
the
absurdity
itself
may
mitigate
against
the
clear
and
present
danger.
but
let
us
assume
that
he
means
by
this
that
we
will
now
bring
(inaudible)
congress
to
repeal
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
to
pass
an
amendment
saying
that
persons
of
certain
ethnic
background
are
no
longer
eligible
for
citizenship
in
united
states.
he
may
be
calling
upon
absurd,
horrible,
frightful,
possible
processes
of
law
but
they
might
still
nevertheless
be
processes
of
law.
there
is
nothing
in
the
standard
that
indicates
his
--
mr.
allen
brown
i
have
--
i'm
afraid
that
if
such
law
were
passed.
it
might
very
well
leave
us
in
the
position,
justice
marshall,
a
finding
that
perhaps
under
certain
circumstances,
it
is
necessary
to
advocate
violence
to
redress
abuses
of
law.
mr.
allen
brown
i
know
--
mr.
allen
brown
certainly.
upon
the
filing
of
this
matter
i
went
to
the
clerk
of
the
supreme
court
and
ordered
a
transcript
of
the
entire
record.
the
clerk
of
the
supreme
court
indicated
to
me
that
since
cert
was
not
allowed
that
portions
of
the
record
were
still
with
the
court
of
appeals.
i
went
to
the
clerk
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
ordered
for
him
an
entire
record
specifically
in
my
press
be
asking
for
the
film.
we
then
actually
engaged
in
physical
search
for
the
film.
it
had
last
in
the
possession
of
sheriff
dante.
dante
went
to
his
safe
and
couldn't
find
it
but
this
clerkmanship
of
the
entire
remainder
of
the
record
and
indicated
to
me
he
would
continue
to
search
for
the
film
and
upon
receipt
of
the
same
would
forward
it
to
this
court.
i
have
not
checked
further.
i
will
upon
my
return
to
cincinnati
immediately
check
further
with
the
court.
mr.
allen
brown
yes,
you
do.
mr.
allen
brown
in
the
appendix
on
pages
--
mr.
allen
brown
--
24
and
25.
mr.
allen
brown
and
there
is
a
second
portion
on
the
second
--
mr.
allen
brown
in
the
--
mr.
allen
brown
yes,
in
the
appellant's
brief.
mr.
allen
brown
on
pages
5
and
6.
mr.
allen
brown
that
describes
in
full
but
one
film
and
then
in
effects
synopsizes
the
second
film.
i
believe
that
the
dispute
is
to
the
content
of
the
second
film.
mr.
allen
brown
of
one
interpret
of
it
--
mr.
allen
brown
there
are
two
films
--
mr.
allen
brown
the
second
film
is
indorsed
--
is
basically
the
same
as
the
speech
made
--
the
speech
portion
of
the
first
film.
the
man
apparently
repeated
basically
the
same
words
with
some
admonition
and
some
additions.
these
admonitions
and
additions
are
substituted
--
are
indicated
in
the
brief
and
both
prosecutions
of
defense
agreed
that
this
is
actual
statement
of
the
second.
the
only
questions
are
assuming
the
first.
mr.
allen
brown
in
view
of
the
fact
your
honor
of
the
amazing
circumstance
in
my
opinion
that
i
did
not
get
allowance
into
the
supreme
court
of
ohio.
i
in
ordering
my
certification
of
record
to
this
court
asked
specifically
that
the
briefs
submitted
to
the
supreme
court
of
ohio.
mr.
allen
brown
so,
they
are
within
the
possession
of
the
clerk
here.
mr.
allen
brown
the
state
has,
not
until
we
appeared
here,
i
think
if
i'm
correct,
never
raise
the
question
of
failing
to
object.
mr.
allen
brown
may
it
please
the
court.
if
the
court
were
--
is
aware
of
the
procedures
and
the
entries
of
the
supreme
court
of
ohio.
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
if
it
is
ruling
that
a
constitutional
question
has
not
been
raised
will
deny
the
motion
to
dismiss
the
appeal
as
of
right
with
the
following
language.
a
constitutional
question
having
not
been
timely
raised
the
same
as
dismissed.
if
the
constitutional
question
has
been
properly
raised,
he
will
use
the
language
in
the
entry
before
you.
mr.
allen
brown
the
--
mr.
allen
brown
considered
to
(voice
overlap).
mr.
allen
brown
now
--
mr.
allen
brown
that's
boilerplate
form
when
you're
just
turning
it
away
on
the
merits
of
the
substantive
constitutional
question.
mr.
allen
brown
judge
holman
and
you
know
him.
mr.
allen
brown
no.
that
was
told
to
me
by
judge
holman.
mr.
allen
brown
either
it
would
not
appear
in
official
record
in
it.
mr.
allen
brown
i
don't
--
i
don't
remember
a
dissent
at
all.
i
don't
remember
said.
i
know
it
was
a
five-two
vote
with
two
dissenters
but
i
don't
remember
any
written
dissent
--
mr.
allen
brown
no.
we've
only
in
this
instance,
your
honor
that
there
had
been
in
fact
similarly
a
year's
delay
after
the
submission
to
the
appellate
court.
we
then
approach
the
appellate
court
asking
why
and
at
that
time,
the
judge
informally
indicated
that
the
man
who
had
been
assigned
to
the
opinion
have
recently,
unfortunately
died
and
that's
how
that
came
to
light.
mr.
allen
brown
the
sentence
was
1
to
10
years
--
mr.
allen
brown
on
each
count
for
$1,000.00
fine.
mr.
allen
brown
concurrent,
yes.
mr.
allen
brown
so,
this
man
could
potentially
for
this
act
of
stupidity
served
under
the
laws
of
ohio
up
to
20
--
oh,
no
10
years
maximum.
mr.
allen
brown
no.
to
win
my
case,
justice
fortas,
may
i
submit
that
the
state
of
ohio
as
just
as
this
moment
indicated
the
massive
invasion
into
the
first
amendment
that
we
have
here
into
when
mr.
kirschner
suggested
that
i
could
run
down
through
harlem
saying,
“kill
the
negroes”
and
justice
marshall
responded,
“you
wouldn't
last
very
long.”
that
justice
marshall
who
is
safe
for
the
moment
because
the
venue
is
in
washington
d.c.
but
in
ohio
could
be
indicted
for
suggesting
a
violent
reaction
by
the
negro
community.
this
is
the
state
of
invasion
under
this
statute
into
the
first
amendment
rights
because
under
the
proposition
that
mr.
kirschner
outlined
here
legally
that
is
precisely
the
effect
of
justice
marshall's
remark.
i
suggest
further
that
we
have
this
unusual
situation.
we
have
such
a
deep-seated
invasion
the
first
amendment
rights
that
we
get
in
meshed
in
difficulties
of
mr.
kirschner
outlines
when
he
says
there
was
no
objection.
incidentally,
i
was
not
counsel
of
record
and
i
have
never
at
this
point
because
i
feel
certain
professional
loyalties
raised
the
question
of
competency
of
counsel
in
the
original
trial.
but
assuming
mr.
kirschner's
reasoning
what
he
has
stated
here
is
that
the
supreme
court
would
have
stated
the
record
before
it,
was
saying
in
effect
that
a
constitutional
issue
is
a
mere
error
of
omission
and
it
is
further
saying
that
the
instructions
that
you
have
before
you
to
read
are
the
dimensions
that
ohio
sets
upon
this
statutes
invasion
of
the
first
amendment.
and
i
suggest
that
if
that
is
the
state
of
the
record,
that
perhaps
my
earlier
response
to
you
justice
brennan
is
not
correct
and
perhaps,
we
must
then
reach
the
statute
and
declare
it
unconstitutional.
mr.
allen
brown
i
should
perhaps
state
for
sake
of
the
record
that
counsel
for
the
appellant
in
no
way
agrees
with
any
of
the
appellant's
positions.
i
will
however
take
the
voluntarian
position
in
relation
to
the
appellant.
mr.
allen
brown
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court.
we
have
before
us
case
arising
in
the
state
of
ohio
under
a
conviction
under
ohio's
criminal
syndicalism
act.
we
have
indeed
before
us
something
of
rarity.
it
is
as
far
as
i
know
a
third
case
ever
tried
under
ohio's
criminal
syndicalism
act
and
the
first
to
ever
reach
the
appellate
level.
i
--
there
was
earlier
in
ohio
when
their
peculiar
proceedings
in
which
a
prosecutor
could
bring
a
proceeding
before
the
supreme
court
on
appeal
for
a
question
of
law
only.
a
proceeding
in
which
--
a
motion
was
made
in
the
lower
court
in
ohio,
attacking
the
constitutionality
of
ohio's
criminal
syndicalism
law.
the
lower
court
in
ohio
held
the
law
to
be
unconstitutional.
it
was
appealed
to
the
supreme
court
in
state
versus
kassay
and
in
what
is
basically
in
advisory
opinion.
the
court
stated
that
it
was
constitutional.
if
the
court
also
stated
several
engaging
other
things.
it
stated
that
the
first
amendment
did
not
apply
to
the
states
of
the
union.
it
also
stated
that
the
measure
of
its
application
was
an
issue
in
its
constitutionality
and
it
would
attend
the
first
trial
of
a
case
to
see
what
is
the
proper
measure
of
its
application.
the
court
waited
patiently
for
the
first
application
to
a
case
that
arose
some
40
years
later
in
this
case
and
surprisingly
despite
the
invitation
here
sent
out
in
kassay,
the
court
declined
to
even
hear
his
constitutional
question
on
the
application
in
this
case.
it
in
fact
defaulted
to
this
court,
ohio's
privilege
are
setting
forth
the
limitations
of
the
application
of
its
statute.
ohio's
privileges
are
setting
forth
potentiality
of
clarification
and
delineation
of
a
statute
which
obviously
on
its
face
rushes
head
long
into
the
first
amendment.
these
are
the
facts
in
this
case.
a
television
reporter
receives
a
telephone
call
indicating
that
if
he
wanted
to
he
could
come
and
take
movies
of
a
ku
klux
klan
meeting.
he
came.
he
met
some
hooded
figures
and
arrangements
were
made
for
the
taking
of
a
movie.
a
movie
was
taken
in
which
a
cross
was
burned,
some
figures
milled
about,
and
yelled
some
stupid
and
rather,
a
senseless
slogans
and
then
a
single
figure
was
panned
on,
and
he
made
a
speech,
a
speech
full
of
conditions,
precedents,
and
reservations,
hyperbola
self-evidently
stupid
and
silly.
the
--he
asserted
that
the
clan
was
the
largest
organization
in
the
state
of
ohio.
he
then
went
on
in
a
--
with
a
condition
precedent
that
if
the
various
branch
is
the
government
including
this
court,
do
not
mend
their
ways
that
revengeance,
a
word
of
his
own
coining
i
assume
would
be
taken.
he
did
not
specify
the
revengeance
and
we
do
not
know
what
particular
aspect
of
the
democratic
process
he
was
going
to
involve
himself
in
revengeance.
he
then
spoke
of
a
march
not
in
identifying
it
as
an
armed
march
or
any
sort
of
march
of
any
force
or
violence
into
washington
and
then
into
two
southern
states,
incidentally,
raising
federal
questions
perhaps
rather
than
internal
state
questions.
another
film
taken
is
inside
the
house
--
mr.
allen
brown
there
were
guns
in
both
films.
mr.
allen
brown
in
both
films.
there
were
guns.
it
is
also
to
be
noted
that
the
film
was
taken
on
a
remote,
private
farm
in
which
apparently
there
is
no
evidence
whatsoever
that
these
people
were
not
invitees
present
on
that
farm
by
authority
of
the
ownership
of
the
farm.
there
was
nothing,
nothing
adduce
an
indictment
was
returned,
i
have
to
some
preliminary
move,
maneuvering
including
a
frontal
attack
on
the
constitutionality
of
a
statute.
the
case
came
on
to
trial.
the
state
produced
nothing
but
the
film
in
question.
the
only
other
evidence
that
the
state
produced
was
basically
geared
to
identifying
the
personnel
involved
in
the
film.
in
other
words,
showing
that
the
man
brandenburg
had
a
gun
similar
to
the
guns
in
the
film
and
that
he
had
markings
on
his
person
similar
to
the
markings
and
that
his
voice
was
similar.
other
than
this,
the
state
offered
nothing.
it
is
critical
that
the
state
offered
nothing
on
the
nature
and
history
of
the
klan.
it
offered
nothing
showing
that
the
course
of
the
klan's
history
any
continuing
historical
or
expert
opinions
concerning
any
possible
commitment
to
violence.
it
offered
nothing
on
the
continuing
organization
of
the
klan,
nothing
whatsoever.
it
offered
nothing
other
than
the
film
itself
and
the
words
intrinsic
in
the
film
itself.
the
state
then
rests
the
defense
in
which
i
was
not
involved.
i'm
appoint
of
counsel
--
appointed
for
purposes
of
appeal.
made
a
motion
for
dismissal
at
that
time,
i
will
frankly
admit
that
the
motion
for
dismissal
which
was
made
by
then
counsel
was
simply
our
weight
of
evidence
motion
and
he
did
not
specifically
denote
the
constitutional
question
that
had
arisen
at
that
point
in
the
presentation
of
the
state's
case.
i
suggest
that
it
is
completely
immaterial
but
he
did
not.
the
defense
then
preceded
forward
and
offered
basically
a
defense
of
the
positive
testimony
in
which
various
members
--
officers
of
the
klan
testified
as
to
their
ostensible
peaceful
purposes
and
things
of
this
sort
and
the
historical
evaluations
of
the
presence
of
weapons
and
the
burning
of
a
cross.
the
court
then
charged
the
jury.
the
court's
charged
the
jury
and
i
specifically
asked
this
court
to
consider
it
carefully.
begins
in
the
appendix
at
page
72
and
met
with
the
statute
that
thrust
itself
clearly
within
the
first
amendment
makes
on
its
face
no
attempt
to
give
us
a
life
indication
of
a
line
demarcation
between
the
mere
abstract
teaching
in
advocacy
or
even
advocacy
in
relation
to
a
clear
and
present
danger
as
to
advocacy
in
a
hypothetical
sense.
that
in
no
way
on
its
face
does
this.
the
court
perpetuated
the
evil
of
the
statute
by
making
the
charge
even
more
general,
in
which
he
indeed
define
the
term
advocacy
as
involving
intrinsic
in
it
in
his
own
charge.
teaching,
so
that
we
have
at
this
point
a
man
who
had
been
tried
with
none
of
the
safeguards
of
the
first
amendment
applied
to
the
trial
of
his
cause
to
the
measure
of
his
evidence
or
to
the
instructions
to
those
who
worked
to
be
the
triers
of
the
fact
which
would
demarcate
the
point
at
which
the
first
amendment
would
be
operative
in
relation
to
what
happen
on
that
isolated
farm
on
that
isolated
day.
mr.
allen
brown
the
pictures,
the
testimony
and
the
pictures
indicate
that
perhaps
20
persons
were
involved.
mr.
allen
brown
no
spectators.
all
were
participants
in
the
meeting.
there
is
some
indication
of
the
record
that
there
were
no
woman
folk
in
the
picture
or
in
the
meeting.
there
are
some
testimonies
in
the
record
that
one
of
the
tv
reporters
said
he
heard,
women's
voices
in
another
room.
i
know
nothing
else
about
the
woman
folk
in
that
occasion.
mr.
allen
brown
pardon,
your
honor?
mr.
allen
brown
the
film
is
an
exhibit.
mr.
allen
brown
i
pray
it
is.
i
have
so
ordered
it
and
at
my
last
words
from
the
clerk
was
that
they
were
having
trouble
finding
it
but
they
would
find
it
and
send
it
on
up
here.
i
devoutly
pray
because
we
do
have
in
this
case
some
issues
as
to
what
is
shown
in
the
film
and
since
--
mr.
allen
brown
yes.
mr.
allen
brown
there
is
a
distinct
dispute.
it
is
our
contention
that
there
was
nothing
in
the
speech
which
is
part
of
the
record
and
it
is
shown
in
the
film
and
since
the
state
limited
itself
to
this.
there
is
nothing
in
it
that
is
a
called
twice
--
mr.
allen
brown
i
assume
my
adversary
disputes
that.
mr.
allen
brown
that's
correct.
mr.
allen
brown
and
the
language
of
the
film
is
actually
in
both
parties'
briefs.
the
difference
between
us
is
that
they
tend
to
ascribe
certain
slogans
by
the
person's
billing
about
to
the
given
defendant.
we
contend
that
the
only
words
that
the
given
defendant
are
ordered
with
the
formal
set
of
speeches.
mr.
allen
brown
this
film
was
shown
over
a
local
television
station
and
a
network.
mr.
allen
brown
that's
correct.
mr.
allen
brown
judge
simon
leis.
does
it
ring
any
bells,
judge?
mr.
allen
brown
okay.
mr.
allen
brown
that
is
correct.
mr.
allen
brown
that
is
correct.
mr.
allen
brown
that's
correct.
the
act
of
showing
it
over
television
which
entered
the
plea
and
intervening
parties,
the
authorities
running
the
television
station
are
not
the
basis
of
the
indictment
--
mr.
allen
brown
--
and
the
charge.
mr.
allen
brown
precisely.
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
the
supreme
court
of
ohio,
we
didn't
raise
it
here
because
we
wanted
to
see
if
we
can
make
sure
that
we
get
assert
--
we
asserted
that
the
film
was
in
the
same
position
as
a
book
in
an
obscenity
case.
mr.
allen
brown
i
know
it
doesn't
help
us
now
but
at
that
point
when
we
before
the
supreme
court
of
ohio,
we
have
asserted
that
saying
that
the
film
in
and
of
itself
is
the
entire
context
of
the
alleged
offense.
mr.
allen
brown
may
it
please
the
court.
there
is
this
important
distinction
to
be
made
between
the
dennis
case
and
that
case.
in
the
dennis
case,
the
teachers
who
taught
these
classes,
this
was
evidence
within
a
total
context
of
a
total
conspiratorial
activity
leading
to
a
total
action
result.
in
this
instance,
the
state
contented
itself
merely
was
showing
a
given
speech
and
did
not
choose
to
present
any
evidence
to
make
it
part
of
a
conspiratorial
whole.
it
took
the
speech
in
and
of
itself
that
represented
only
--
mr.
allen
brown
that
is
correct.
mr.
allen
brown
that
is
correct.
mr.
allen
brown
that's
correct.
mr.
allen
brown
what
happened
on
that
farm
on
that
day
and
that
is
the
important
distinction
to
be
made.
mr.
allen
brown
there
is
evidence
in
the
record
that
indicate
that
his
was
the
voice
that
called
the
radio,
tv
announcement.
mr.
allen
brown
that
maybe
the
case
judge
--
justice
fortas.
mr.
allen
brown
i
think
that
however
the
state
of
ohio
chose
not
to
charge
him
for
that.
mr.
allen
brown
it's
quite
potentially
possible.
this
is
however
not
what
the
state
chose
to
charge
him
on,
read
the
indictment
and
--
mr.
allen
brown
in
the
dennis
case,
i
submit
that
the
court
did
not
take
such
judicial
notice.
that
in
the
dennis
case
as
a
matter
fact,
there
was
the
adoption
of
evidence
to
show
that.
mr.
allen
brown
but
in
any
event
--
mr.
allen
brown
in
any
event,
it
is
clear
that
in
the
dennis
case
there
was
additional
evidence
other
--
over
and
above
that
adduce
in
this
case.
in
this
case,
they
showed
nothing
but
the
film
itself.
they
showed
no
other
plan
or
purposively
other
than
that.
mr.
allen
brown
that
is
a
potential
distinction
between
this
case
and
the
dennis
case
as
well.
these
are
paltry
unknown
rather
silly
characters.
in
the
dennis
case,
we're
dealing
with
the
established
leadership
of
a
national
organization.
this
does
make
a
difference
in
relation
to
the
rights
prevailing
under
the
first
amendment.
the
--
but
in
this
given
case,
there
are
other
distinctions
which
i'll
pass
to
in
a
moment.
in
this
given
case,
we
are
dealing
with
a
statute
which
on
its
very
face
thrust
itself
into
the
first
amendment.
we
are
dealing
in
this
situation,
not
with
an
address
to
an
evil
from
which
we
must
move
back
to
a
possible
restraint
upon
first
amendment
for
there's
a
dealing
with
an
entry
particularly
into
the
right
and
then
a
prescription
upon
the
right
as
it
might
engender
an
evil.
for
instance,
the
statute
starts
off.
no
person
shall
by
word
of
mouth
or
writing
at
the
gate
or
teach
the
duty
and
goes
on
from
that
point.
it
denotes
first
amendment
here
we
come.
it
does
not
say
that
no
person
shall
not
advocate
or
teach
the
duty
and
necessity
of
propriety
of
crime.
it
does
not
then
become
so
broad
that
it
could
possibly
take
symbolic
acts
or
acting
out
that
go
beyond
mere
words
of
mouth
and
printing.
it
announces
wholly,
here
we
come
first
amendment
and
proceeds
from
that
point
on
advocate
or
teach.
now,
the
prosecution
in
this
case
has
said
that
the
issue
of
teach
is
not
involved
here
because
the
man
was
charged
only
under
advocacy
but
if
the
distinctions
between
teaching
an
advocacy
was
so
simplistic,
we
would
have
a
very
simple
solution
in
this
case.
but
as
a
teacher,
who
teaches
in
the
first
grade
that
the
american
revolution
was
a
noble
thing,
is
she
merely
teaching
or
is
she
advocating?
the
lines
of
demarcation
between
teaching
an
advocacy
are
so
difficult
that
they
leave
us
vulnerable
when
we
charged
advocacy
alone.
in
order
to
reserve
a
portion
of
my
time
for
rebuttal,
i
would
like
to
point
out
however,
what
i
think
is
the
most
absurd
aspect
of
this
particular
statute.
it
also
forbids
not
only
speech
or
printing.
it
becomes
very,
very
evasive
on
the
whole
question
of
intent
scienter
and
mens
rea,
think
carefully.
it
comes
very,
very
unclear
on
the
whole
area
of
willfulness
except
for
occasional
phrase
in
multiplicity
of
phrases.
in
addition
to
which,
it
forbids
the
assembly
with
any
group
and
it
forbids
not
only
membership
by
problem
that
is
been
before
this
court.
not
only
affiliation
of
problem
to
this
court
but
indeed
even
forbids
seating
down
with
such
group
in
an
error
in
which
they
are
trying
to
preserve
the
dialogue
benefits
to
society
of
the
first
amendment.
it
is
incredible
that
the
legislature
of
ohio
forbids
us
even
to
seat
down.
mr.
allen
brown
that's
correct.
mr.
allen
brown
i
certainly
would
prefer
that
you
did,
however
--
mr.
allen
brown
this
court
could
potentially
strike
this
down,
not
merely
on
the
instruction
but
indeed
on
the
face
of
the
record
that
it
is
not
constitutionality
sufficient
to
constitute
an
offense.
mr.
allen
brown
on
the
evidence.
this
court
has
those
alternatives,
i
cannot
escape.
mr.
allen
brown
however,
i
offer
this
posture
that
the
defendant
in
this
cause
asserted
that
he
was
not
tried
by
a
motion
to
quash
the
indictment
and
at
this
court
perhaps
must
assume
his
posture
and
find
that
he
should
never
had
been
brought
to
trial
into
that
--
under
those
circumstances.
mr.
allen
brown
what's
before
you
in
the
entire
--
mr.
allen
brown
i
don't
from
work
--
mr.
allen
brown
--
the
intake.
mr.
allen
brown
this
is
our
brief
your
honor.
mr.
allen
brown
may
it
please
the
court.
let
me
several
things
concerning
--
mr.
allen
brown
how
do
we
know
this
is
a
program?
how
do
we
know
--
mr.
allen
brown
if
you
believe
what
the
speaker
says,
this
absurd
hyperbola
is
a
program.
however,
the
program
is
a
program
of
ostensible
social
reform
but
does
not
necessarily
indicate
on
the
face
of
his
remarks
an
intent
to
violence
or
to
commit
a
crime.
i
agree
with
the
court,
it
is
assert
--
mr.
allen
brown
i
assume
that
he's
offering
this.
i
agree
that
he
--
we
are
operating
within
an
absurd
premise.
indeed,
the
absurdity
itself
may
mitigate
against
the
clear
and
present
danger.
but
let
us
assume
that
he
means
by
this
that
we
will
now
bring
(inaudible)
congress
to
repeal
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
to
pass
an
amendment
saying
that
persons
of
certain
ethnic
background
are
no
longer
eligible
for
citizenship
in
united
states.
he
may
be
calling
upon
absurd,
horrible,
frightful,
possible
processes
of
law
but
they
might
still
nevertheless
be
processes
of
law.
there
is
nothing
in
the
standard
that
indicates
his
--
mr.
allen
brown
i
have
--
i'm
afraid
that
if
such
law
were
passed.
it
might
very
well
leave
us
in
the
position,
justice
marshall,
a
finding
that
perhaps
under
certain
circumstances,
it
is
necessary
to
advocate
violence
to
redress
abuses
of
law.
mr.
allen
brown
i
know
--
mr.
allen
brown
certainly.
upon
the
filing
of
this
matter
i
went
to
the
clerk
of
the
supreme
court
and
ordered
a
transcript
of
the
entire
record.
the
clerk
of
the
supreme
court
indicated
to
me
that
since
cert
was
not
allowed
that
portions
of
the
record
were
still
with
the
court
of
appeals.
i
went
to
the
clerk
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
ordered
for
him
an
entire
record
specifically
in
my
press
be
asking
for
the
film.
we
then
actually
engaged
in
physical
search
for
the
film.
it
had
last
in
the
possession
of
sheriff
dante.
dante
went
to
his
safe
and
couldn't
find
it
but
this
clerkmanship
of
the
entire
remainder
of
the
record
and
indicated
to
me
he
would
continue
to
search
for
the
film
and
upon
receipt
of
the
same
would
forward
it
to
this
court.
i
have
not
checked
further.
i
will
upon
my
return
to
cincinnati
immediately
check
further
with
the
court.
mr.
allen
brown
yes,
you
do.
mr.
allen
brown
in
the
appendix
on
pages
--
mr.
allen
brown
--
24
and
25.
mr.
allen
brown
and
there
is
a
second
portion
on
the
second
--
mr.
allen
brown
in
the
--
mr.
allen
brown
yes,
in
the
appellant's
brief.
mr.
allen
brown
on
pages
5
and
6.
mr.
allen
brown
that
describes
in
full
but
one
film
and
then
in
effects
synopsizes
the
second
film.
i
believe
that
the
dispute
is
to
the
content
of
the
second
film.
mr.
allen
brown
of
one
interpret
of
it
--
mr.
allen
brown
there
are
two
films
--
mr.
allen
brown
the
second
film
is
indorsed
--
is
basically
the
same
as
the
speech
made
--
the
speech
portion
of
the
first
film.
the
man
apparently
repeated
basically
the
same
words
with
some
admonition
and
some
additions.
these
admonitions
and
additions
are
substituted
--
are
indicated
in
the
brief
and
both
prosecutions
of
defense
agreed
that
this
is
actual
statement
of
the
second.
the
only
questions
are
assuming
the
first.
mr.
allen
brown
in
view
of
the
fact
your
honor
of
the
amazing
circumstance
in
my
opinion
that
i
did
not
get
allowance
into
the
supreme
court
of
ohio.
i
in
ordering
my
certification
of
record
to
this
court
asked
specifically
that
the
briefs
submitted
to
the
supreme
court
of
ohio.
mr.
allen
brown
so,
they
are
within
the
possession
of
the
clerk
here.
mr.
allen
brown
the
state
has,
not
until
we
appeared
here,
i
think
if
i'm
correct,
never
raise
the
question
of
failing
to
object.
mr.
allen
brown
may
it
please
the
court.
if
the
court
were
--
is
aware
of
the
procedures
and
the
entries
of
the
supreme
court
of
ohio.
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
if
it
is
ruling
that
a
constitutional
question
has
not
been
raised
will
deny
the
motion
to
dismiss
the
appeal
as
of
right
with
the
following
language.
a
constitutional
question
having
not
been
timely
raised
the
same
as
dismissed.
if
the
constitutional
question
has
been
properly
raised,
he
will
use
the
language
in
the
entry
before
you.
mr.
allen
brown
the
--
mr.
allen
brown
considered
to
(voice
overlap).
mr.
allen
brown
now
--
mr.
allen
brown
that's
boilerplate
form
when
you're
just
turning
it
away
on
the
merits
of
the
substantive
constitutional
question.
mr.
allen
brown
judge
holman
and
you
know
him.
mr.
allen
brown
no.
that
was
told
to
me
by
judge
holman.
mr.
allen
brown
either
it
would
not
appear
in
official
record
in
it.
mr.
allen
brown
i
don't
--
i
don't
remember
a
dissent
at
all.
i
don't
remember
said.
i
know
it
was
a
five-two
vote
with
two
dissenters
but
i
don't
remember
any
written
dissent
--
mr.
allen
brown
no.
we've
only
in
this
instance,
your
honor
that
there
had
been
in
fact
similarly
a
year's
delay
after
the
submission
to
the
appellate
court.
we
then
approach
the
appellate
court
asking
why
and
at
that
time,
the
judge
informally
indicated
that
the
man
who
had
been
assigned
to
the
opinion
have
recently,
unfortunately
died
and
that's
how
that
came
to
light.
mr.
allen
brown
the
sentence
was
1
to
10
years
--
mr.
allen
brown
on
each
count
for
$1,000.00
fine.
mr.
allen
brown
concurrent,
yes.
mr.
allen
brown
so,
this
man
could
potentially
for
this
act
of
stupidity
served
under
the
laws
of
ohio
up
to
20
--
oh,
no
10
years
maximum.
mr.
allen
brown
no.
to
win
my
case,
justice
fortas,
may
i
submit
that
the
state
of
ohio
as
just
as
this
moment
indicated
the
massive
invasion
into
the
first
amendment
that
we
have
here
into
when
mr.
kirschner
suggested
that
i
could
run
down
through
harlem
saying,
“kill
the
negroes”
and
justice
marshall
responded,
“you
wouldn't
last
very
long.”
that
justice
marshall
who
is
safe
for
the
moment
because
the
venue
is
in
washington
d.c.
but
in
ohio
could
be
indicted
for
suggesting
a
violent
reaction
by
the
negro
community.
this
is
the
state
of
invasion
under
this
statute
into
the
first
amendment
rights
because
under
the
proposition
that
mr.
kirschner
outlined
here
legally
that
is
precisely
the
effect
of
justice
marshall's
remark.
i
suggest
further
that
we
have
this
unusual
situation.
we
have
such
a
deep-seated
invasion
the
first
amendment
rights
that
we
get
in
meshed
in
difficulties
of
mr.
kirschner
outlines
when
he
says
there
was
no
objection.
incidentally,
i
was
not
counsel
of
record
and
i
have
never
at
this
point
because
i
feel
certain
professional
loyalties
raised
the
question
of
competency
of
counsel
in
the
original
trial.
but
assuming
mr.
kirschner's
reasoning
what
he
has
stated
here
is
that
the
supreme
court
would
have
stated
the
record
before
it,
was
saying
in
effect
that
a
constitutional
issue
is
a
mere
error
of
omission
and
it
is
further
saying
that
the
instructions
that
you
have
before
you
to
read
are
the
dimensions
that
ohio
sets
upon
this
statutes
invasion
of
the
first
amendment.
and
i
suggest
that
if
that
is
the
state
of
the
record,
that
perhaps
my
earlier
response
to
you
justice
brennan
is
not
correct
and
perhaps,
we
must
then
reach
the
statute
and
declare
it
unconstitutional.
mr.
allen
brown
i
should
perhaps
state
for
sake
of
the
record
that
counsel
for
the
appellant
in
no
way
agrees
with
any
of
the
appellant's
positions.
i
will
however
take
the
voluntarian
position
in
relation
to
the
appellant.
