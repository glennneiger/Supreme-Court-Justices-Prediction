mr.
leonard
kirschner
mr.
chief
justice
and
honorable
members
of
this
court.
i
do
not
know
why
the
film
is
not
here
at
the
present
time.
i
do
know
that
i
--
well
that's
i
did
know
where
it
was
as
of
two
months
ago.
i
viewed
it
subsequent
to
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
hearings
and
it's
in
the
clerk's
office
of
the
clerk
of
the
hamilton
county,
court
of
common
pleas
in
his
possession,
locked
up
in
a
file,
fireproof
file
i
might
add
and
i
don't
know
why
it
is
not
here.
i'm
certain
that
it
can
be
forwarded
to
this
court
for
examination.
mr.
leonard
kirschner
i
will
never
to
follow
through
on
the
court's
request.
the
court's
permission
as
i
take
it
basically
there
are
two
points
involved
in
this
case.
one,
is
the
ohio
statute
on
criminal
syndicalism
and
two,
the
evidence
that
was
presented
to
a
judge
and
jury
upon
which
a
finding
and
verdict
of
guilty
was
returned.
now,
counsel,
i
believe
that
the
ohio
criminal
syndicalism
law
is
constitutional.
i
have
cited
various
authorities
relative
to
my
beliefs
in
this
matter
in
my
brief.
i
believe
that
the
basic
matter
before
this
court
is
the
application
of
the
evidence
as
was
presented
to
the
jury
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
was
sufficient
evidence
upon
which
a
jury
could
return
a
verdict.
i
believe
that
in
this
case
when
counsel
says
sending
the
jews
back
to
israel,
let's
give
them
back
to
the
dark
garden
that
this
might
not
involved
violence.
i
would
like
him
perhaps
in
his
reply
to
explain
how
the
statement,
“bury
the
niggers”
would
not
constitute
a
violent
form
of
actions.
now
in
this
case,
there
is
two
basic
parts
of
the
film.
one,
that
was
taken
inside
of
a
room
in
which
the
defendant
clarence
brandenburg
was
identified
and
i
don't
believe
there
is
any
question
or
any
in
the
record
either
between
the
appellant
and
the
appellee
in
this
matter
relative
to
his
identification
as
he
being
the
person
saying,
this
is
an
organizer's
meeting
we
have
had
quite
a
few
members
here
today
which
are
we
have
had
hundred
--
hundreds
of
members
throughout
the
state
and
so
forth.
then
there
is
a
second
portion
of
the
film
in
which
a
group
of
people
are
walking
or
marching
around
a
burning
cross,
hooded,
armed,
shouting
profanities
in
which
there
is
a
question
whether
or
not
the
defendant
himself
said
the
words
as
attributed
to
him
in
the
transcript
and
on
page
5.
“how
far
is
the
nigger
going
to
--
yeah.”
“send
the
jews
back
to
israel”
and
so
forth
with
the
other
profanities.
there
is
some
evidence
in
the
transcript
itself
which
could
indicate
as
a
jury
sitting
and
listening
in
that
the
defendant
himself
made
one
or
more
of
these
statements,
and
i
apologize
to
the
court
for
not
having
this
as
part
of
my
brief.
i
notified
counsel
of
the
possibility
of
my
bringing
this
matter
up.
ohio
has
a
section
in
its
code.
ohio
revised
code
section
1.17
which
provides,
whoever
aids,
abets,
or
procures
another
to
commit
an
offense
may
be
prosecuted
as
if
he
were
the
principal
offender.
we
have
a
group
of
people
marching
around
as
an
organizer's
meeting
toward
the
acts
of
violence
and
in
that
they
had
attributed
and
desired
the
suppression
of
the
negro.
mr.
leonard
kirschner
with
the
court's
permission
at
the
time
of
the
marching
around
the
cross,
the
size
was
approximately
10
to
20
as
counsel
for
appellant
has
stated.
mr.
leonard
kirschner
prior
to
that
--
mr.
leonard
kirschner
yes,
sir.
i
believe
that
the
defendants
own
statement.
we
have
had
in
his
statement
when
he's
inside
the
building.
we
have
had
quite
a
few
members
here
today
which
are
and
then
he
goes
on
to
say,
showing
that
there
had
been
several
members
there.
i
might
further
point
out
as
one
of
the
justices
i
believe
it
was
justice
--
mr.
leonard
kirschner
i'm
sorry
sir?
mr.
leonard
kirschner
that
was
just
before
that.
that
is
the
preface
to
the
opening
of
that
statement.
yes,
sir.
mr.
leonard
kirschner
well,
if
your
honor
please.
i
believe
that
we
have
to
take
the
entire
actions
of
the
defendant
himself
that
we
cannot
limit
it
to
just
what
these
words
say.
i
believe
the
evidence
clearly
show
that
the
defendant
himself
contacted
the
television
station
for
the
purpose
of
having
a
television,
cameramen,
and
newsmen
out
of
that
meeting
to
take
pictures
to
put
it
out
over
the
television
station.
so,
when
we
say
there
are
10
or
20
people
at
this
meeting.
i
don't
think
we
can
limit
ourselves
to
just
those
10
or
20
people.
this
is
a
plan,
a
concert
action
on
the
part
of
this
defendant
to
broadcast
this
as
it
appears
to
me
and
upon
which
a
jury
could
determine
this
profanities,
whatever
you
would
want
to
call
it
across
a
large
segment
of
the
community
in
ohio.
and
subsequently,
i
might
add
to
that
was
picked
up
by
a
network
television.
i
don't
think
we
can
limit
ourselves
to
just
10
or
20
people.
although
in
and
of
itself,
i
would
say
that
the
statements
such
as
this
to
10
or
20
people
can
cause
a
one
heck
of
a
lot
of
crime
and
violence
to
terrorism
in
any
community.
it
only
takes
one
person
to
cause
it
but
you
get
10
or
20
with
hoods,
shotguns,
rifles,
and
other
things.
saying,
“kill
a
nigger”,
“send
the
jews
back
to
israel”,
“send
the
dark
men
back
to
africa”,
etcetera.
riding
in
a
community
and
i
say,
you
can
cause
violence,
crime
and
terrorism
right
at
the
start
with
just
two
men
not
like
--
not
10
or
20
as
the
record
indicates.
mr.
leonard
kirschner
well,
but
the
broadcast
was
not
in
the
country.
the
broadcast
was
to
the
community,
locally.
mr.
leonard
kirschner
well,
as
a
part
--
mr.
leonard
kirschner
no.
i
--
i
would
say
that
perhaps
my
interpretation
of
it
is
different
from
your
honors.
as
part
of
that
meeting,
this
man
had
set
up,
right
then
and
there
a
television
camera.
his
acts
at
that
meeting
were
addressing
not
only
the
people
who
were
standing
in
front
of
him
but
the
vast
audience
of
the
community
who
would
receive
this
broadcast
by
way
of
the
television
communication.
which
he
himself
has
arranged
in
which
the
record
shows
that
he
was
the
one
that
contacted
the
television
station
to
get
them
there
in
the
first
place.
so,
i
would
say,
yes,
his
acts
at
the
scene
but
i
don't
think
you
can
limit
it
to
just
the
10
or
20
people
who
were
there.
mr.
leonard
kirschner
that
is
correct
your
honor.
that
is
my
opinion.
mr.
leonard
kirschner
with
the
court's
permission,
the
elements
of
the
events
as
given
by
the
court
instruction
in
this
matter
were
basically
that
they
shall
--
the
reading
of
the
indictment
and
the
definition
of
the
word
advocacy
as
pronounced
by
the
statute
of
ohio.
the
definition
of
advocacy
is
spelled
out
in
the
code
section
and
i
believe
without
giving
specific
verbiage
it
is
spelled
out
in
the
appendix.
it
is
basically
that
aspect
that
was
spelled
out
in
this
matter.
mr.
leonard
kirschner
with
the
court's
permission
in
this
matter
there
were
no
instructions
relative
to
clear
and
present
danger
given
by
the
court.
mr.
leonard
kirschner
with
the
court's
permission
in
the
determination
as
to
a
specific
spelling
out
item
by
item
of
advocacy
of
action,
no.
as
to
a
general
interpretation,
i
believe,
yes.
i
believe
the
ohio
code
in
its
definition
does
interpret
advocacy
of
action.
it
is
advocacy
of
action
of
crime,
violence,
terrorism
not
an
abstract
doctrine.
it
is
the
efficacy
of
the
action
to
do
violence,
to
do
terrorism
and
with
regard
to
that
matter
with
the
court's
permission
as
i
spelled
out
in
my
brief.
ohio
has
a
rule
that
an
error
of
omission
is
not
an
error
in
the
charge.
i
want
to
point
out
further
that
counsel
for
the
appellant
giving
him
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
inadvertently
left
out
that
aspect
of
the
charge
in
which
the
court
turned
to
the
defense
counsel
and
specifically
ask
defendant's
attorney,
“do
you
have
anything
to
add
to
my
charge?”
to
which
at
that
point,
defense
counsel
says
and
i
may
be
getting
the
not
quite
the
exact
verbiage,
“no,
your
honor
we
are
satisfied.”
mr.
leonard
kirschner
with
the
court's
permission
that
is
not
in
the
appendix,
however,
i
have
spelled
it
out
in
my
brief
itself.
mr.
leonard
kirschner
page
5,
if
your
honor
please.
this
is
spelled
out
in
the
transcript
on
page
219
of
the
actual
transcript.
the
question,
“counsel
for
the
state
anything
to
add
to
the
court's
charge?”
mr.
nicklen
(ph),
who
was
counsel
for
the
state,
“nothing,
your
honor.”
the
court,
“counsel
for
the
defending
anything
to
add
to
the
court's
charge?”
mr.
elkhart
(ph),
counsel
for
the
defendant,
“no,
your
honor.”
this
is
at
page
219
of
the
transcript
that
is
spelled
out
on
page
5.
mr.
leonard
kirschner
with
the
court's
permission,
the
constitutional
issue
relative
to
the
aspect
of
clear
and
present
danger
was
raised
in
the
--
mr.
leonard
kirschner
i
believe
it
was
raised
in
the
supreme
court
of
ohio.
i
took
the
case
on
at
that
level.
i
was
not
the
trial
counsel
nor
was
i
the
appellant
counsel.
mr.
leonard
kirschner
let
me
give
this
aspect.
i
can
not
speak
for
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
as
to
their
interpretation
of
verbiage.
i
can
give
this
court
procedure,
the
procedure
in
the
matter
if
defense
counsel
files
his
appeal
within
time
and
as
of
right.
at
that
point,
defense
counsel
and
the
state
appeared
in
columbus,
ohio
at
which
time
the
court
through
its
representative
heard
arguments
both
for
and
against
the
allowing
--
mr.
leonard
kirschner
--
and
the
constitutional
questions
by
the
ohio
supreme
court
at
that
point.
subsequent
to
that,
the
court
then
issued
this
ruling.
mr.
leonard
kirschner
yes,
sir.
mr.
leonard
kirschner
well,
if
your
honor
please.
what
i
am
saying
is
this,
the
charge
that
the
court
gave
insofar
as
it
went
was
not
incorrect.
i
am
saying
further
that
the
absence
of
the
verbiage
clear
and
present
danger
did
not
make
that
charge
void.
i
am
saying
--
mr.
leonard
kirschner
what's
your
problem?
mr.
leonard
kirschner
i
would
say
that
if
you
disagreed
with
the
basic
premise
that
is
the
duty
of
counsel
to
raise
that
objection
at
the
time
and
that
the
law
of
ohio
is
incorrect
--
mr.
leonard
kirschner
well,
if
the
court's
permission
as
i
have
indicated.
it
is
my
humble
belief
that
this
is
basically
a
state
statute.
if
you
determine
that
state's
statute
is
valid,
you
go
to
the
evidence.
and
i
believe
that
this,
the
evidence,
was
there
and
the
only
way
that
it
should
be
thrown
out
as
if
there
was
no
evidence
upon
which
a
jury
could
have
reach
this
finding
because
the
court
--
court's
charge
that
was
given
was
specific
enough
and
direct
enough
to
cover
the
clear
and
present
danger
to
cover
all
of
other
aspects
of
the
case.
now,
--
mr.
leonard
kirschner
i
believe
that
the
advocacy
at
the
scene
which
was
to
be
set
to
the
members
there
as
well
as
advocacy
which
was
planned
to
go
out
over
the
television
network
constituted
a
violation
of
the
ohio
syndicalism
laws
insofar
as
the
indictment
charge,
violence
or
unlawful
methods
of
terrorism.
and
i
believe
that
--
mr.
leonard
kirschner
with
due
respect
to
the
court,
in
my
humble
opinion,
i
believe
that
that
the
network
people
in
working
with
this
advocacy,
there
has
to
be
an
intention,
if
it
can
be
shown
that
they
intentionally
put
this
out
over
the
television
networks
with
the
thought
of
bringing
violence
or
terrorism
that
it
is
my
humble
belief
that
they
may
be
indicted
the
same
as
clarence
brandenburg
was
in
this
case
in
violation
of
the
ohio
laws.
mr.
leonard
kirschner
if
the
court
please,
i
believe
that
the
court
and
the
jury
may
looked
to
the
words
itself,
the
surrounding
aspects
as
your
honor
in
a
reference
that
you
recently
wrote
on
civil
disobedience
and
civil
disorder
stated.
even
if
what
is
said
does
not
create
a
clear
and
present
danger
and
i
believe
that
it
was
a
clear
and
present
danger
at
the
time.
a
physical
injury
to
others,
the
place
where
the
speech
is
uttered,
the
size
of
the
crowd,
the
circumstances
may
convert
the
lawful
into
the
unlawful.
it
is
my
humble
belief
that
the
circumstances,
if
this
was
on
a
rural
farm
where
nobody
was
around,
nobody
would
hear
this
except
perhaps
five
people
in
a
little
circle.
and
clarence
brandenburg
was
never
tried
here,
the
defendant
in
this
case,
to
the
propagation
of
this
epithets,
derogatory
statements
or
column
which
he
made
through
the
television
networks,
i
say
that
the
state
of
ohio's
case
would
be
substantially
weakened.
but
in
this
case,
it
is
not
someone
else
contacting
the
television
networks.
it
is
clarence
brandenburg
himself
who
contacts
the
television
newsman
himself,
requesting
that
they
have
a
man
there
to
take
his
picture,
making
certain
statements
and
to
take
his
group
of
which
he
is
the
leader
and
organizer
of
in
propagating
these
statements
to
the
general
public
of
cincinnati
--
mr.
leonard
kirschner
with
the
court's
permission,
it
is
my
humble
belief
that
you
do
not
have
to
have
anything
further.
if
i
were
to
go
and
i
use
this
as
an
extreme
statement
but
if
i
were
to
run
down
harlem
shall
we
say
and
say,
“bury
the
negro”,
“send
them
back
to
the
black
africa.”
mr.
leonard
kirschner
probably
so,
your
honor.
and
if
i
were
to
go
to
israel
and
say
the
same
thing
about
sending
the
jews
to
the
arab
countries
or
something
or
to
any
other,
i
don't
say
derogatory
but
i
say
that
because
these
are
the
two
groups
that
the
defendant
has
picked
up
on
in
his
derogatory
statements.
i
say
the
very
words
themselves
indicate
--
mr.
leonard
kirschner
as
i
indicated
with
the
court's
permission
it
is
my
humble
belief
that
in
the
addition
there
must
be
an
intention
to
cause
the
violence,
the
--
mr.
leonard
kirschner
--
the
terrorism.
mr.
leonard
kirschner
other
than
the
defendant's
action
which
i
believe
indicate
his
intention,
there
is
no
other
proof.
mr.
leonard
kirschner
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
kirschner
yes,
sir.
mr.
leonard
kirschner
six
--
i
believe
it
was
1966
and
--
1967
if
i'm
not
mistaken
and
1968,
however
--
mr.
leonard
kirschner
--
however,
there
was
at
the
time
unrest.
there
were
marches
at
that
time,
i
believe
in
the
south.
there
were
the
propositions
specifically,
i
believe
the
birmingham
situation
was
at
or
around
that
particular
time
and
there
was
civil
unrest
and
dispute
going
out
through
the
entire
country
and
i
don't
think
it
just
be
limited
to
the
south
as
such.
it
was
played
up
by
the
press
and
the
news
media.
mr.
leonard
kirschner
yes.
to
riots?
no.
mr.
leonard
kirschner
i
believe
that
there
was
--
mr.
leonard
kirschner
there
were
civil
--
there
were
protest
march
within
the
concepts
of
legal
protest,
demonstrations,
picketing
of
that
nature
at
that
time
in
cincinnati
but
in
nature
of
riots
of
that
nature?
no,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
kirschner
no,
sir.
it
was
basically
a
feeling
i
believe
throughout
the
entire
united
states,
however,
limited
as
such
to
the
community.
thank
you.
mr.
leonard
kirschner
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
leonard
kirschner
mr.
chief
justice
and
honorable
members
of
this
court.
i
do
not
know
why
the
film
is
not
here
at
the
present
time.
i
do
know
that
i
--
well
that's
i
did
know
where
it
was
as
of
two
months
ago.
i
viewed
it
subsequent
to
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
hearings
and
it's
in
the
clerk's
office
of
the
clerk
of
the
hamilton
county,
court
of
common
pleas
in
his
possession,
locked
up
in
a
file,
fireproof
file
i
might
add
and
i
don't
know
why
it
is
not
here.
i'm
certain
that
it
can
be
forwarded
to
this
court
for
examination.
mr.
leonard
kirschner
i
will
never
to
follow
through
on
the
court's
request.
the
court's
permission
as
i
take
it
basically
there
are
two
points
involved
in
this
case.
one,
is
the
ohio
statute
on
criminal
syndicalism
and
two,
the
evidence
that
was
presented
to
a
judge
and
jury
upon
which
a
finding
and
verdict
of
guilty
was
returned.
now,
counsel,
i
believe
that
the
ohio
criminal
syndicalism
law
is
constitutional.
i
have
cited
various
authorities
relative
to
my
beliefs
in
this
matter
in
my
brief.
i
believe
that
the
basic
matter
before
this
court
is
the
application
of
the
evidence
as
was
presented
to
the
jury
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
was
sufficient
evidence
upon
which
a
jury
could
return
a
verdict.
i
believe
that
in
this
case
when
counsel
says
sending
the
jews
back
to
israel,
let's
give
them
back
to
the
dark
garden
that
this
might
not
involved
violence.
i
would
like
him
perhaps
in
his
reply
to
explain
how
the
statement,
“bury
the
niggers”
would
not
constitute
a
violent
form
of
actions.
now
in
this
case,
there
is
two
basic
parts
of
the
film.
one,
that
was
taken
inside
of
a
room
in
which
the
defendant
clarence
brandenburg
was
identified
and
i
don't
believe
there
is
any
question
or
any
in
the
record
either
between
the
appellant
and
the
appellee
in
this
matter
relative
to
his
identification
as
he
being
the
person
saying,
this
is
an
organizer's
meeting
we
have
had
quite
a
few
members
here
today
which
are
we
have
had
hundred
--
hundreds
of
members
throughout
the
state
and
so
forth.
then
there
is
a
second
portion
of
the
film
in
which
a
group
of
people
are
walking
or
marching
around
a
burning
cross,
hooded,
armed,
shouting
profanities
in
which
there
is
a
question
whether
or
not
the
defendant
himself
said
the
words
as
attributed
to
him
in
the
transcript
and
on
page
5.
“how
far
is
the
nigger
going
to
--
yeah.”
“send
the
jews
back
to
israel”
and
so
forth
with
the
other
profanities.
there
is
some
evidence
in
the
transcript
itself
which
could
indicate
as
a
jury
sitting
and
listening
in
that
the
defendant
himself
made
one
or
more
of
these
statements,
and
i
apologize
to
the
court
for
not
having
this
as
part
of
my
brief.
i
notified
counsel
of
the
possibility
of
my
bringing
this
matter
up.
ohio
has
a
section
in
its
code.
ohio
revised
code
section
1.17
which
provides,
whoever
aids,
abets,
or
procures
another
to
commit
an
offense
may
be
prosecuted
as
if
he
were
the
principal
offender.
we
have
a
group
of
people
marching
around
as
an
organizer's
meeting
toward
the
acts
of
violence
and
in
that
they
had
attributed
and
desired
the
suppression
of
the
negro.
mr.
leonard
kirschner
with
the
court's
permission
at
the
time
of
the
marching
around
the
cross,
the
size
was
approximately
10
to
20
as
counsel
for
appellant
has
stated.
mr.
leonard
kirschner
prior
to
that
--
mr.
leonard
kirschner
yes,
sir.
i
believe
that
the
defendants
own
statement.
we
have
had
in
his
statement
when
he's
inside
the
building.
we
have
had
quite
a
few
members
here
today
which
are
and
then
he
goes
on
to
say,
showing
that
there
had
been
several
members
there.
i
might
further
point
out
as
one
of
the
justices
i
believe
it
was
justice
--
mr.
leonard
kirschner
i'm
sorry
sir?
mr.
leonard
kirschner
that
was
just
before
that.
that
is
the
preface
to
the
opening
of
that
statement.
yes,
sir.
mr.
leonard
kirschner
well,
if
your
honor
please.
i
believe
that
we
have
to
take
the
entire
actions
of
the
defendant
himself
that
we
cannot
limit
it
to
just
what
these
words
say.
i
believe
the
evidence
clearly
show
that
the
defendant
himself
contacted
the
television
station
for
the
purpose
of
having
a
television,
cameramen,
and
newsmen
out
of
that
meeting
to
take
pictures
to
put
it
out
over
the
television
station.
so,
when
we
say
there
are
10
or
20
people
at
this
meeting.
i
don't
think
we
can
limit
ourselves
to
just
those
10
or
20
people.
this
is
a
plan,
a
concert
action
on
the
part
of
this
defendant
to
broadcast
this
as
it
appears
to
me
and
upon
which
a
jury
could
determine
this
profanities,
whatever
you
would
want
to
call
it
across
a
large
segment
of
the
community
in
ohio.
and
subsequently,
i
might
add
to
that
was
picked
up
by
a
network
television.
i
don't
think
we
can
limit
ourselves
to
just
10
or
20
people.
although
in
and
of
itself,
i
would
say
that
the
statements
such
as
this
to
10
or
20
people
can
cause
a
one
heck
of
a
lot
of
crime
and
violence
to
terrorism
in
any
community.
it
only
takes
one
person
to
cause
it
but
you
get
10
or
20
with
hoods,
shotguns,
rifles,
and
other
things.
saying,
“kill
a
nigger”,
“send
the
jews
back
to
israel”,
“send
the
dark
men
back
to
africa”,
etcetera.
riding
in
a
community
and
i
say,
you
can
cause
violence,
crime
and
terrorism
right
at
the
start
with
just
two
men
not
like
--
not
10
or
20
as
the
record
indicates.
mr.
leonard
kirschner
well,
but
the
broadcast
was
not
in
the
country.
the
broadcast
was
to
the
community,
locally.
mr.
leonard
kirschner
well,
as
a
part
--
mr.
leonard
kirschner
no.
i
--
i
would
say
that
perhaps
my
interpretation
of
it
is
different
from
your
honors.
as
part
of
that
meeting,
this
man
had
set
up,
right
then
and
there
a
television
camera.
his
acts
at
that
meeting
were
addressing
not
only
the
people
who
were
standing
in
front
of
him
but
the
vast
audience
of
the
community
who
would
receive
this
broadcast
by
way
of
the
television
communication.
which
he
himself
has
arranged
in
which
the
record
shows
that
he
was
the
one
that
contacted
the
television
station
to
get
them
there
in
the
first
place.
so,
i
would
say,
yes,
his
acts
at
the
scene
but
i
don't
think
you
can
limit
it
to
just
the
10
or
20
people
who
were
there.
mr.
leonard
kirschner
that
is
correct
your
honor.
that
is
my
opinion.
mr.
leonard
kirschner
with
the
court's
permission,
the
elements
of
the
events
as
given
by
the
court
instruction
in
this
matter
were
basically
that
they
shall
--
the
reading
of
the
indictment
and
the
definition
of
the
word
advocacy
as
pronounced
by
the
statute
of
ohio.
the
definition
of
advocacy
is
spelled
out
in
the
code
section
and
i
believe
without
giving
specific
verbiage
it
is
spelled
out
in
the
appendix.
it
is
basically
that
aspect
that
was
spelled
out
in
this
matter.
mr.
leonard
kirschner
with
the
court's
permission
in
this
matter
there
were
no
instructions
relative
to
clear
and
present
danger
given
by
the
court.
mr.
leonard
kirschner
with
the
court's
permission
in
the
determination
as
to
a
specific
spelling
out
item
by
item
of
advocacy
of
action,
no.
as
to
a
general
interpretation,
i
believe,
yes.
i
believe
the
ohio
code
in
its
definition
does
interpret
advocacy
of
action.
it
is
advocacy
of
action
of
crime,
violence,
terrorism
not
an
abstract
doctrine.
it
is
the
efficacy
of
the
action
to
do
violence,
to
do
terrorism
and
with
regard
to
that
matter
with
the
court's
permission
as
i
spelled
out
in
my
brief.
ohio
has
a
rule
that
an
error
of
omission
is
not
an
error
in
the
charge.
i
want
to
point
out
further
that
counsel
for
the
appellant
giving
him
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
inadvertently
left
out
that
aspect
of
the
charge
in
which
the
court
turned
to
the
defense
counsel
and
specifically
ask
defendant's
attorney,
“do
you
have
anything
to
add
to
my
charge?”
to
which
at
that
point,
defense
counsel
says
and
i
may
be
getting
the
not
quite
the
exact
verbiage,
“no,
your
honor
we
are
satisfied.”
mr.
leonard
kirschner
with
the
court's
permission
that
is
not
in
the
appendix,
however,
i
have
spelled
it
out
in
my
brief
itself.
mr.
leonard
kirschner
page
5,
if
your
honor
please.
this
is
spelled
out
in
the
transcript
on
page
219
of
the
actual
transcript.
the
question,
“counsel
for
the
state
anything
to
add
to
the
court's
charge?”
mr.
nicklen
(ph),
who
was
counsel
for
the
state,
“nothing,
your
honor.”
the
court,
“counsel
for
the
defending
anything
to
add
to
the
court's
charge?”
mr.
elkhart
(ph),
counsel
for
the
defendant,
“no,
your
honor.”
this
is
at
page
219
of
the
transcript
that
is
spelled
out
on
page
5.
mr.
leonard
kirschner
with
the
court's
permission,
the
constitutional
issue
relative
to
the
aspect
of
clear
and
present
danger
was
raised
in
the
--
mr.
leonard
kirschner
i
believe
it
was
raised
in
the
supreme
court
of
ohio.
i
took
the
case
on
at
that
level.
i
was
not
the
trial
counsel
nor
was
i
the
appellant
counsel.
mr.
leonard
kirschner
let
me
give
this
aspect.
i
can
not
speak
for
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
as
to
their
interpretation
of
verbiage.
i
can
give
this
court
procedure,
the
procedure
in
the
matter
if
defense
counsel
files
his
appeal
within
time
and
as
of
right.
at
that
point,
defense
counsel
and
the
state
appeared
in
columbus,
ohio
at
which
time
the
court
through
its
representative
heard
arguments
both
for
and
against
the
allowing
--
mr.
leonard
kirschner
--
and
the
constitutional
questions
by
the
ohio
supreme
court
at
that
point.
subsequent
to
that,
the
court
then
issued
this
ruling.
mr.
leonard
kirschner
yes,
sir.
mr.
leonard
kirschner
well,
if
your
honor
please.
what
i
am
saying
is
this,
the
charge
that
the
court
gave
insofar
as
it
went
was
not
incorrect.
i
am
saying
further
that
the
absence
of
the
verbiage
clear
and
present
danger
did
not
make
that
charge
void.
i
am
saying
--
mr.
leonard
kirschner
what's
your
problem?
mr.
leonard
kirschner
i
would
say
that
if
you
disagreed
with
the
basic
premise
that
is
the
duty
of
counsel
to
raise
that
objection
at
the
time
and
that
the
law
of
ohio
is
incorrect
--
mr.
leonard
kirschner
well,
if
the
court's
permission
as
i
have
indicated.
it
is
my
humble
belief
that
this
is
basically
a
state
statute.
if
you
determine
that
state's
statute
is
valid,
you
go
to
the
evidence.
and
i
believe
that
this,
the
evidence,
was
there
and
the
only
way
that
it
should
be
thrown
out
as
if
there
was
no
evidence
upon
which
a
jury
could
have
reach
this
finding
because
the
court
--
court's
charge
that
was
given
was
specific
enough
and
direct
enough
to
cover
the
clear
and
present
danger
to
cover
all
of
other
aspects
of
the
case.
now,
--
mr.
leonard
kirschner
i
believe
that
the
advocacy
at
the
scene
which
was
to
be
set
to
the
members
there
as
well
as
advocacy
which
was
planned
to
go
out
over
the
television
network
constituted
a
violation
of
the
ohio
syndicalism
laws
insofar
as
the
indictment
charge,
violence
or
unlawful
methods
of
terrorism.
and
i
believe
that
--
mr.
leonard
kirschner
with
due
respect
to
the
court,
in
my
humble
opinion,
i
believe
that
that
the
network
people
in
working
with
this
advocacy,
there
has
to
be
an
intention,
if
it
can
be
shown
that
they
intentionally
put
this
out
over
the
television
networks
with
the
thought
of
bringing
violence
or
terrorism
that
it
is
my
humble
belief
that
they
may
be
indicted
the
same
as
clarence
brandenburg
was
in
this
case
in
violation
of
the
ohio
laws.
mr.
leonard
kirschner
if
the
court
please,
i
believe
that
the
court
and
the
jury
may
looked
to
the
words
itself,
the
surrounding
aspects
as
your
honor
in
a
reference
that
you
recently
wrote
on
civil
disobedience
and
civil
disorder
stated.
even
if
what
is
said
does
not
create
a
clear
and
present
danger
and
i
believe
that
it
was
a
clear
and
present
danger
at
the
time.
a
physical
injury
to
others,
the
place
where
the
speech
is
uttered,
the
size
of
the
crowd,
the
circumstances
may
convert
the
lawful
into
the
unlawful.
it
is
my
humble
belief
that
the
circumstances,
if
this
was
on
a
rural
farm
where
nobody
was
around,
nobody
would
hear
this
except
perhaps
five
people
in
a
little
circle.
and
clarence
brandenburg
was
never
tried
here,
the
defendant
in
this
case,
to
the
propagation
of
this
epithets,
derogatory
statements
or
column
which
he
made
through
the
television
networks,
i
say
that
the
state
of
ohio's
case
would
be
substantially
weakened.
but
in
this
case,
it
is
not
someone
else
contacting
the
television
networks.
it
is
clarence
brandenburg
himself
who
contacts
the
television
newsman
himself,
requesting
that
they
have
a
man
there
to
take
his
picture,
making
certain
statements
and
to
take
his
group
of
which
he
is
the
leader
and
organizer
of
in
propagating
these
statements
to
the
general
public
of
cincinnati
--
mr.
leonard
kirschner
with
the
court's
permission,
it
is
my
humble
belief
that
you
do
not
have
to
have
anything
further.
if
i
were
to
go
and
i
use
this
as
an
extreme
statement
but
if
i
were
to
run
down
harlem
shall
we
say
and
say,
“bury
the
negro”,
“send
them
back
to
the
black
africa.”
mr.
leonard
kirschner
probably
so,
your
honor.
and
if
i
were
to
go
to
israel
and
say
the
same
thing
about
sending
the
jews
to
the
arab
countries
or
something
or
to
any
other,
i
don't
say
derogatory
but
i
say
that
because
these
are
the
two
groups
that
the
defendant
has
picked
up
on
in
his
derogatory
statements.
i
say
the
very
words
themselves
indicate
--
mr.
leonard
kirschner
as
i
indicated
with
the
court's
permission
it
is
my
humble
belief
that
in
the
addition
there
must
be
an
intention
to
cause
the
violence,
the
--
mr.
leonard
kirschner
--
the
terrorism.
mr.
leonard
kirschner
other
than
the
defendant's
action
which
i
believe
indicate
his
intention,
there
is
no
other
proof.
mr.
leonard
kirschner
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
kirschner
yes,
sir.
mr.
leonard
kirschner
six
--
i
believe
it
was
1966
and
--
1967
if
i'm
not
mistaken
and
1968,
however
--
mr.
leonard
kirschner
--
however,
there
was
at
the
time
unrest.
there
were
marches
at
that
time,
i
believe
in
the
south.
there
were
the
propositions
specifically,
i
believe
the
birmingham
situation
was
at
or
around
that
particular
time
and
there
was
civil
unrest
and
dispute
going
out
through
the
entire
country
and
i
don't
think
it
just
be
limited
to
the
south
as
such.
it
was
played
up
by
the
press
and
the
news
media.
mr.
leonard
kirschner
yes.
to
riots?
no.
mr.
leonard
kirschner
i
believe
that
there
was
--
mr.
leonard
kirschner
there
were
civil
--
there
were
protest
march
within
the
concepts
of
legal
protest,
demonstrations,
picketing
of
that
nature
at
that
time
in
cincinnati
but
in
nature
of
riots
of
that
nature?
no,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
kirschner
no,
sir.
it
was
basically
a
feeling
i
believe
throughout
the
entire
united
states,
however,
limited
as
such
to
the
community.
thank
you.
mr.
leonard
kirschner
thank
you,
sir.
