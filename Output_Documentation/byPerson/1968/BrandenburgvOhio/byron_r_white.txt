justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
gather
mr.
brown
that
apart
from
your
argument
addressed
to
the
statute
itself,
divorce
from
the
actual
prosecution
here.
you
do
argue
don't
you
that
the
first
amendment
considerations
are
so
close
to
the
surface
and
the
prosecution
under
such
a
statute
that
at
the
very
least
that
required
an
instruction
which
was
not
given
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
recognized
of
and
if
we
agree
with
you
on
that
score,
i
gather
we
don't
have
two
reach
the
question
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
itself,
do
we?
you'd
rather
we
did
but
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
we
don't
have
to
if
we
strike
it
down
and
it
(inaudible).
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
on
the
evidence.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
what's
before
us
is
a
conviction
in
this
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
we
agree
reverse
the
conviction,
i
take
that
is
much
as
you're
entitled
to
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
may
i
add
up
mr.
kirschner.
i
gather
these
constitutional
questions
were
raised
on
the
appeal
whatever
that
procedure
is
that
those
to
in
your
supreme
court,
were
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
may
i
ask
this
question
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
may
i
ask
mr.
kirschner,
i'm
looking
at
page
85
which
is
the
judgment
of
supreme
court
of
ohio.
what
does
this
mean?
it
says,
the
cause
here
on
appeal
as
of
right
was
heard
in
the
manner
prescribed
by
law
and
no
motion
to
dismiss
the
appeal
having
been
filed.
the
court
that
is
the
supreme
court,
sua
sponte,
dismisses
the
appeal
for
the
reason
that
no
substantial
constitutional
question
exist
herein.
i
may
--
do
i
read
this
correctly
if
i
suppose
this
means,
if
they
examine
the
record
to
see
if
any
of
the
constitutional
questions
asserted
was
substantial.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
constitutional
questions?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
doesn't
this
suggest
that
the
--
whatever
the
constitutional
questions
that
were
raised
and
i
gather
you
tell
me
the
clear
and
present
danger
was
among
them,
was
considered
and
decided?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
if
that's
so,
what
difference
does
it
make
with
the
no
objection
was
taken
to
the
charge?
if
your
supreme
court
reached
and
decided
these
questions
then
they're
properly
here,
they
overlooked
that
they
didn't
get
a
picture
on.
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
we
disagree
with
that.
the
problem
is
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
if
we
disagree
with
that
whether
we
can
reach
it
and
face
with
the
fact
that
there
was
no
objection.
and
as
i
gather
from
this
judgment
with
the
supreme
court
of
ohio,
it
considered
and
decided
the
constitutional
questions,
i
suppose
in
that
circumstance
is
immaterial.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
we
disagree
with
the
basic
premise.
it
is
that
was
not
given
as
a
reason
by
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
not
to
decide
the
merits
of
the
constitutional
same
on
the
contrary.
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
apparently
did
consider
and
decide
the
constitutional
questions,
notwithstanding
the
failure
to
make
objections.
and
if
that
so,
i
think,
isn't
it
so
that
issues
then
properly
before
us?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
brown,
i
don't
suppose
that
whatever
is
you
and
mr.
kirschner
have
submitted
to
supreme
court
of
ohio
was
in
the
record
before
us
yet,
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
they're
probably
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
have
you
any
recollection
whether
the
state
raised
the
question
of
failure
to
object
to
the
instructions
as
one
reason
that
the
issue
should
not
be
--
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
how
do
you
interpret
that
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
ohio?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
see.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
that
that's
to
say
then
in
your
view
that
judgment
should
be
--
justice
byron

--
read
as
a
determination
on
the
merits
of
the
constitutional
questions.
