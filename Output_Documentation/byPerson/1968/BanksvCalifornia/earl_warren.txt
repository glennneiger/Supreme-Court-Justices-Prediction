do
you
think
that
when
this
court
sends
the
case
back
for
reconsideration
in
the
light
of
a
certain
case
that
the
court
can
just
say
without
more
--
we've
consider
it
and
we
adhere
to
our
--
we
adhere
to
our
former
opinion
and
that
exactly
what
happen
in
this
case.

in
the
chapman
case,

must
be
able
to
declare
a
belief
that
it

the
reasonable
doubt.
we
have
given
further
considerations
to
this
cause
in
the
light
of

do
you
think
that

all
the
court
has
to
do
is
to
say
without
more?
we've
reconsidered
it
and
we
adhere
to
our
former
opinion.
do
you
not
think
it
cause
for
some
review
of
the
situation
through
counsel
or
through
petitioner
some
way
to
satisfy
the
mandate
of
this
