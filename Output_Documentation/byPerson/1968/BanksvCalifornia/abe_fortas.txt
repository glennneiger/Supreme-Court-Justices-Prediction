justice
abe
fortas
well,
our
mandate
didn't
say
he
should
be
given
a
hearing,
did
it?
justice
abe
fortas
and
so
the
question
that
you're
presenting
to
us
really
as
on
your
theory
of
the
case
is,
what
should
those
proceedings
be
a
more
specifically
was
the
petitioner
entitled
to
counsel
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
for
purposes
of
those
private
proceedings
that
this
court
ordered
on
remand,
that's
number
one.
and
number
two,
you're
raising
a
question
of
the
standard
to
be
applied
with
respect
to
the
determination
of
harmless
error,
am
i
right?
justice
abe
fortas
i
notice
--
i
notice
in
your
brief
you've
got
very
elaborate
brief
and
you
argue
a
lot
of
points
but
aren't
those
two
points
that
i
stated
the
points
that
are
before
us?
justice
abe
fortas
that
is
to
say
one,
whether
on
the
further
proceedings
ordered
by
us
for
purposes
of
considering
griffin
against
california's
application
to
this
case,
counsel
should
have
been
appointed.
and
two,
whether
the
court
below
properly
applied
the
harmless
error
standard
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
do
you
concede
then
that
the
proper
standard
for
determining
whether
the
error
was
harmless.
was
whether
the
--
it
is
not
as
court
below
said,
it
is
not
reasonably
--
it
is
or
is
not
reasonably
probable
that
a
result
more
favorable
to
banks,
the
petitioner,
would
have
been
reached
in
the
absence
of
the
error.
do
you
believe
that's
a
correct
standard?
justice
abe
fortas
why
don't
you
tell
us
as
succinctly
as
you
can,
if
you
don't
mind
about
what
you
think
the
standard
is?
i
was
reading
from
page
333
of
the
appendix.
justice
abe
fortas
if
you
don't
think
the
reasonable
probability
of
a
more
favorable
result
standard
is
correct
what
do
you
think
is
the
correct
standard?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
how
would
you
state
it
--
justice
abe
fortas
how
would
you
state
it?
would
you
say
for
example
that
if
there
is
any
basis
on
which
the
jury
might
rationally
conclude
that
the
defendant
was
innocent?
justice
abe
fortas
but
then
it's
not
harmless
beyond
reasonable
doubt?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
the
court
did
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
see.
so
what
you
would
say
is
that
if
there's
a
basis
in
the
record
for
thinking
that
a
single
juror
might
have
refused
to
vote
for
the
defendant's
guilt,
then
you
can't
find
harmless
error.
justice
abe
fortas
what
your
--
let
me
see
if
i
can
understand
this.
the
standard
adopted
by
the
court
was
that
the
court
arrived
at
the
conclusion
that
there
was
conclusive
evidence
of
guilt
and
therefore,
the
error
was
harmless
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt.
and
are
you
suggesting
to
us
that
that
is
different
from
the
court
to
examining
this
to
see
that
--
examining
the
record
to
see
whether
there
was
a
possibility
that
a
juror
might
not
be
persuaded
that
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt
that
this
man
was
guilty.
justice
abe
fortas
you're
saying
that
--
that
is
the
advice
in
this
standard.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
here
you
had
some
sort
of
a
proceeding
and
this
--
when
this
case
was
before
the
court
for
the
third
time.
did
mr.
chapsky
file
a
paper
or
enter
an
appearance
so
said
in
addition
--
i
assume
his
appearance
had
been
entered
before,
had
it?
justice
abe
fortas
and
if
you
consider
this
as
part
of
the
same
record
as
this
as
one
might.
you
would
assumed
nevertheless
in
this
--
that
counsel
would
file
some
sort
of
paper
and
say,
well
i'm
still
counsel
to
petitioner,
i
have
nothing
further
to
say
if
that
was
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that's
exactly
--
justice
abe
fortas
very
well
--
i've
seen
a
lot
of
those
cases
in
that's
i
guess
one
of
the
reasons
for
a
good
deal
of
interest
in
this
case
from
heart.
justice
abe
fortas
you
see
what
i
mean.
justice
abe
fortas
now,
i
wonder
if
you'd
tell
us
whether
there
is
a
rule
of
the
district
court
of
appeal
with
respect
to
oral
argument
and
if
so,
what
is
it?
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that
but
i
wonder
whether
there
was
a
court
--
whether
there
was
a
rule
of
court
that
would
indicate
who
has
the
option
of
making
that
decision.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
suppose
--
justice
abe
fortas
do
you
mean
just
by
the
court
even
without
asking
the
parties.
the
court
dispensed
this
deciding
a
case
without
asking
the
parties
whether
they
want
to
argue
or
not.
justice
abe
fortas
but
that's
not
the
basis
on
which
the
decision
below
has
rested
by
the
court.
justice
abe
fortas
i
suppose
that
there
is
some
doubt
as
to
whether
the
court
applied
the
correct
standard
from
plaintiff
by
chapman,
the
question
is
whether
a
harmless
error
is
harmless
--
is
harmless
error
in
terms
of
a
judgment
of
the
court
that
there
was
conclusive
evidence
of
guilt
which
is
what
was
done
here
or
whether
the
courts
tasks
is
to
determine
whether
beyond
reasonable
doubt
no
rational
or
reasonable
juror
could
have
felt
that
could
arrived
that
a
different
conclusion
absent
improper
comment.
justice
abe
fortas
applied
which
standard?
justice
abe
fortas
the
court
of
appeals
here
applied
the
first
standard
that
is
to
say
looked
at
the
whole
record
and
said,
“from
the
whole
record
we
find
that
there
is
conclusive
evidence
of
guilt.”
but
i'm
suggesting
the
possibility
that
may
not
be
the
same
thing
as
if
the
court
of
appeals
had
looked
at
it
to
determine
whether
a
single
juror
might
have
declined
to
find
the
defendant
guilty
in
the
absence
of
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
wouldn't
that
before
the
second
not
the
third
--
justice
abe
fortas
what
page
is
that?
justice
abe
fortas
what
do
you
think
chapman
meant
by
the
reference
to
the
burden
--
burden
on
the
party
which
had
one
below?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
what
does
the
prosecution
do
here?
justice
abe
fortas
you're
on
the
third
go
round.
didn't
do
anything,
do
you?
justice
abe
fortas
saying,
we
don't
care
to
brief
it
anymore.
justice
abe
fortas
that's
the
point
one.
point
two,
what
do
you
think
about
the
bearing
of
the
statement
in
chapman
which
is
quoted
from
fahey
on
this
case.
the
question
is
where
there's
a
reasonable
possibility
that
the
evidence
complained
of
might
have
contributed
to
the
conviction.
do
you
think
that's
the
same
thing
that
was
stated
by
your
court
that
is
your
court
said
that
we
conclude
that
there's
convincing
evidence
of
guilt,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
you
think
those
are
the
same
standards?
justice
abe
fortas
unless
you
what
the
chapman
says
“from
fahey”.
do
you
think
that
that's
the
same
thing
as
saying
that
base
upon
the
conclusive
evidence
of
his
guilt?
do
you
think
that's
the
same
thing
as
saying
that
to
paraphrase
the
standard
in
chapman
taken
from
fahey
that
same
thing
is
saying
that
there
is
no
reasonable
possibility
that
the
evidence
or
here
the
comment
complained
off
might
have
contributed
to
the
conviction.
do
you
think
those
are
the
same
thing?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
our
mandate
didn't
say
he
should
be
given
a

did
it?
justice
abe
fortas
and
so
the

was
whether

it

standard
is
correct
what
do
you
think
is
the
