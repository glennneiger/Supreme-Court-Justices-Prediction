justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
anything
in
the
record
from
the
lawyer?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
he
do
anything?
justice
thurgood
marshall

justice
thurgood
marshall
did
he
argue?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
did
he
have
counsel?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
did
he
have
counsel
in
any
effective
way?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
wasn't
the
case
set
back
for
that
purpose?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
i
would
assume
that
counsel
on
both
sides
to
prepare
to
argue
on
that
point.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
in
this
case,
petitioner
had
no
counsel
on
that
point?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
show
me
something
that
he
said,
wrote
or
did,
the
counsel?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
he
say
anything
to
the
court?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
yet
you
said
that
he
had
counsel?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
you
really
mean
if
he
is
so
guilty,
he
doesn't
need
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
you
don't
take
the
same
position
the
court
did,
do
you?
it
is
just
because
he's
guilty,
nothing
will
save
him.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
was
there
last
sentence
and
opinion?
justice
thurgood
marshall
don't
we
have
the
procedure
in
california?
and
all
would
say
upon
the
briefs
and
argument?
i
know
it's
in
the
order
here
but
you
couldn't
have
such
an
order
here.
you
couldn't
file
an
order
that
said
that
the
court
upon
consideration
of
the
case,
the
briefs,
and
arguments
orders?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
couldn't
say
that,
do
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
would
you
commit
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
was
this
submitted?
did
the
petitioner
ever
submit
this
case
to
the
court?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
only
letter
that
i
saw
was
the
letter
asking
for
a
lawyer.
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
he
say
they
submitted
and
then
won't
argue?
did
he
waive
argument?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
why
wasn't
he
permitted
to
argue?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
so
the
counsel
can
waive
his
rights?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
is?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
if
--
well,
assuming
that
the
paying
client
says
i
want
you
to
argue,
what
happens?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
if
the
paying
client
says,
i'm
giving
you
$25,000.00
more
dollars,
i
want
you
to
argue
my
case.
you
mean
counsel
submits
without
argument.
justice
thurgood
marshall
sure
would.
but
in
this
case,
these
men
have
almost
non-existent
counsel.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
he
didn't
argue
this
anyway.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
it
orally
or
written?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
in
this
one
that's
before
us
now,

didn't
argue
anyway,
anyhow,
anytime,
anyplace.

thurgood
marshall

the
one
that's
before
us
now.
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
did
nothing.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
his
counsel
did
nothing.
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
he
do
anything
else
in
the
court?
justice
thurgood
marshall
