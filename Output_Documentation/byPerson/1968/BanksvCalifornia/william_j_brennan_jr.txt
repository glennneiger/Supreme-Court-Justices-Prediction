justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
before
you
sit
down
mr.
o'brien.
i
notice
mr.
klitgaard's
reply
brief
suggests
but
what
it
says,
it
was
doubtful.
the
state's
supreme
court
could
have
granted
review
that
is
on
either
remand.
even
headed
one
or
two,
citing
two
california
decisions.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
--
what
actually
happened
here
when
we
sent
back
first
time
on
the
griffin?
all
of
the
record
show
is
an
opinion
which
ends
with
judgment
affirmed.
now,
its
mean
by
judgment
affirmed.
that's
a
judgment
of
conviction,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
initial
judgment
of
conviction.
was
there
any
new
judgment
entered
at
all
at
that
time?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no.
no
--
no.
was
there
a
judgment
under
the
--
even
in
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there
was?
it's
not
in
the
record,
anyway?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
a
decision.
that's
--
i'm
asking
a
judgment
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
for
a
separate
judgment
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words,
the
practices,
not
in
the
court
of
appeals
when
it
affirm
a
judgment
of
conviction
to
enter
an
independent
judgment
of
affirmance
of
the
convictions.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
those
remittiturs
anywhere
in
this
circuit?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
when
you
petition
for
a
hearing
in
this
--
in
your
supreme
court,
what
is
that
you
petition
from?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
may
i
ask
if
the
petition
from
the
judgment
of
the
trial
court
on
this
second
go
round.
he
did
attempt
to
get
--
to
go
the
supreme
court
from
the
initial
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
was
denied.
now
would
he
--
the
second
time,
would
he
go
back
again
a
petition
from
the
same
judgment
of
conviction?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then
if
the
form
--
i
petition
from
the
judgment
of
conviction
for
error
and
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you
are
telling
us
that
both
the
second
time
and
the
third
time,
he
might
have
done
when
he
attempted
unsuccessfully
do
the
first
time.
that
is
to
go
to
the
supreme
court
for
a
hearing
on
the
decision
of
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
you
--
there's
been
a
lot
of
remands
to
the
district
court
of
appeals
in
this
court
in
the
last
couple
of
years.
do
you
remember
anywhere
after
the
remand
in
the
action
by
the
court
of
appeals?
there
actually
was
a
petition
to
the
supreme
court
of
california
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
which
--
which
was
granted?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
to
whom?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
know
but
he
--
you
don't
know
whether
the
district
--
whether
the
supreme
court
denied
a
hearing
because
it
couldn't
hear
it
or
because
it
wouldn't
hear
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know,
you
say
its
clear
but
i
should
--
but
why
is
that
--
if
might
--
it
is
just
might
be
very
helpful
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there
was
that
--
there
was
actually
an
instance
in
which
this
--
which
the
supreme
court
actually
reviewed
a
case
after
remand.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
they
may
begin?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
there's
nothing
to
grant
to
suggest
that
the
manner
--
the
petitioner
will
matter
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
these
cases.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
yes.
but
if
one
of
your
arguments
is
whether
or
not
the
standard
used
to
in
terms
of
harmless
error
was
used
by
the
district
court
of
appeals
was
correct
or
not,
that
sounds
like
a
pretty
--
pretty
clear
question
of
law
which
you
could
have
taken
it
to
california
supreme
court.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
--
you
mean,
when
you
never
got
a
lawyer
--
when
you
haven't
got
a
lawyer
what
--
you
don't
need
to
get
the
judgment
within
to
the
highest
court
of
state.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
just
set
aside,
so?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
it
was
no
longer
in
effect
until
it
was
reentered
some
time.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
what
did
we
set
aside?
which
--
what
judgment
did
we
vacate?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
right.
we
didn't
vacate
the
judgment
of
convictions?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
about
--
thought
about
--you
could
not
have
gone
for
the
first
time
to
the
supreme
court
of
california
i
gather,
until
that
judgment
which
we
vacate
was
entered
by
the
court
of
appeals,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
--
what
went
to
the
supreme
court
at
the
time
the
petitioner
attempted
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
that
was
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals,
wasn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
now
it
denies
hearing
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
means,
if
the
judgment
--
the
final
judgment
--
appellate
judgment
in
the
case,
is
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
and
isn't
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
we
vacated?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
then,
when
the
new
opinion
was
filed
what
happened?
a
new
judgment
of
court
of
appeals
or
a
reinstatement
of
the
original
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
fairly
stated
counsel?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
before
you
sit
down
mr.
o'brien.
i
notice
mr.
klitgaard's
reply
brief
suggests
but
what
it
says,
it
was
doubtful.
the
state's
supreme
court
could
have
granted
review
that
is
on
either
remand.
even
headed
one
or
two,
citing
two
california
decisions.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
--
what
actually
happened
here
when
we
sent
back
first
time
on
the
griffin?
all
of
the
record
show
is
an
opinion
which
ends
with
judgment
affirmed.
now,
its
mean
by
judgment
affirmed.
that's
a
judgment
of
conviction,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
initial
judgment
of
conviction.
was
there
any
new
judgment
entered
at
all
at
that
time?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no.
no
--
no.
was
there
a
judgment
under
the
--
even
in
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there
was?
it's
not
in
the
record,
anyway?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
a
decision.
that's
--
i'm
asking
a
judgment
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
for
a
separate
judgment
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words,
the
practices,
not
in
the
court
of

when
it
affirm
a
judgment
of
conviction
to
enter
an
independent
judgment
of

justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
those
remittiturs
anywhere
in
this
circuit?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
when
you
petition
for
a
hearing
in
this
--
in
your
supreme
court,
what
is
that
you
petition
from?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
may
i
ask
if
the
petition
from
the
judgment
of
the
trial
court
on
this
second
go
round.
he
did
attempt
to
get
--
to
go
the
supreme
court
from
the
initial
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
was
denied.
now
would
he
--
the
second
time,
would
he
go
back
again
a
petition
from
the
same
judgment
of
conviction?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then
if
the
form
--
i
petition
from
the
judgment
of
conviction
for
error
and
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you
are
telling
us
that
both
the
second
time
and
the
third
time,
he
might
have
done
when
he
attempted
unsuccessfully
do
the
first
time.
that
is
to
go
to
the
supreme
court
for
a
hearing
on
the
decision
of
the

justice
william
j.
brennan,

if

a

there
actually
was
a
petition
to
the

--
justice
william

--
which
--
which
was
granted?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
to
whom?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
know
but
he
--
you
don't
know
whether
the
district
--
whether
the
supreme
court
denied
a
hearing
because
it
couldn't
hear
it
or
because
it
wouldn't
hear
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know,
you
say
its
clear
but
i
should
--
but
why
is
that
--
if
might
--
it
is
just
might
be
very
helpful
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there
was
that
--
there
was
actually
an
instance
in
which
this
--
which
the
supreme
court
actually
reviewed
a
case
after
remand.
justice
william
j.
brennan,

so
they
may
begin?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

well,
there's
nothing
to
grant
to
suggest
that
the
manner

the

will
matter
--
justice
william

these

oh,
yes.
but
if

is
whether

the

which
you
could
have
taken
it
to
california
supreme

justice
william
j.

jr.
you
mean
--
you
mean,
when
you
never
got
a
lawyer
--
when
you
haven't
got
a
lawyer
what
--
you
don't
need
to
get
the
judgment
within
to
the
highest
court
of

justice
william
j.
brennan,

you
just
set
aside,
so?
justice
william
j.

yes,
it
was
no
longer
in
effect
until
it
was
reentered
some

justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
what
did
we
set
aside?
which
--
what
judgment
did
we
vacate?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
right.
we
didn't
vacate
the
judgment
of
convictions?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
about
--
thought
about
--you
could
not
have
gone
for
the
first
time
to
the
supreme
court
of
california
i
gather,
until
that
judgment
which
we
vacate
was

is

justice
william

then
--
what
went
to
the
supreme
court
at
the
time
the
petitioner
attempted
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
that
was
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals,
wasn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
now
it
denies
hearing
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
means,
if
the
judgment
--
the
final
judgment
--
appellate
judgment
in
the
case,
is
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,

--
and
isn't
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
we
vacated?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
then,
when
the
new
opinion
was
filed
what
happened?
a
new
judgment
of
court
of
appeals
or
a
reinstatement
of
the
original
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
fairly
stated
counsel?
