mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
initial
point
that
i
wish
to
bring
to
this
court's
attention
is
that
of
this
court's
jurisdiction
to
review
the
present
case.
this
court's
jurisdiction
in
reviewing
state
courts'
decisions
is
of
course
limited
to
those
judgments
rendered
by
the
highest
court
of
a
state
in
which
decision
could
be
held.
after
this
court
remanded,
the
banks
case
to
be
reviewed
in
light
of
chapman.
the
court
of
appeals
of
california
rendered
its
position
on
october
2,
1967.
the
petitioner
did
not
thereafter
petition
for
a
hearing
in
the
california
supreme
court.
it
is
well
settled
that
the
judgment
of
an
intermediate
appellate
court
is
not
that
of
a
highest
state
court
where
discretionary
review
is
available
and
not
sought.
that
is
precisely
the
situation
here
under
california
constitution
and
laws.
the
california
supreme
court
has
discretionary
power
to
review
the
court
of
appeals.
and
therefore,
the
judgment
in
this
case
is
not
of
the
highest
court
of
state.
the
petitioner
--
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
yes,
your
honor.
on
the
remand,
he
sent
a
letter
into
the
court
of
appeals
stating
that
he
wished
a
second
counsel
or
a
different
counsel
and
gave
as
his
reason
that
the
counsel,
his
appointed
counsel
on
the
original
appeal
decided
in
1964
did
not
raise
the
griffin
constitutional
issue.
but
the
court
of
appeals
answered
petitioner's
letter
and
pointed
out
to
him
that
he
was
not
in
effect
that
he
could
not
expect
counsel
to
anticipate
that
to
be
clairvoyant
to
spot
the
griffin
issue
in
1964.
indeed,
this
court
has
said
as
much
in
the
o'connor
versus
ohio
case
and
he
gave
no
other
reason
to
the
court
of
appeals
as
to
why
he
should
be
entitled
to
a
second
or
different
counsel.
in
the
reply
brief
and
an
effort
to
avoid
the
--
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
the
appointed
counsel
your
honor
on
--
at
the
time
of
the
remand
did
not
file
a
brief.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
ah,
he
filed
nothing
--
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
he
filed
nothing
with
the
court,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
no,
your
honor.
there
was
no
argument
in
the
case.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
yes,
your
honor.
he
did.
he
had
--
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
he
had
been
appointed
counsel,
mr.
chapsky,
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
on
each
remand.
the
court
of
appeals
informed
both
the
petitioner
and
his
counsel
that
if
they
wish
they
could
submit
additional
written
argument
on
the
griffin
and
the
chapman
issue.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
yes,
your
honor,
in
the
sense
that
he
had
appointed
counsel
and
then
it
was
a
choice
by
counsel
as
to
whether
or
not
to
file
a
supplemental
brief
on
the
chapman
case.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
to
--
for
the
court
of
appeals
to
review
in
light
of
chapman.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
yes,
your
honor.
they
would
be.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
oh,
yes.
i
am
--
well,
i
dispute
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
petitioner
--
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
he
did
not
write
anything
to
the
court,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
no,
your
honor.
he
did
not.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
yes,
your
honor.
the
question
being
in
other
words
we
can
take
a
case
in
which
the
cases
before
the
court
and
while
it
is
before
that
court
a
decision
by
this
court
or
perhaps
by
the
california
supreme
court
comes
down.
and
the
question
would
be,
is
there
a
duty
on
the
part
of
counsel
whether
retained
or
appointed
to
file
a
supplemental
brief
on
this
case
which
has
impact
on
that
appeal.
now,
i
think
in
that
situation
that
due
process
does
not
require
an
automatic
brief
supplemental
brief
to
be
filed
in
that
situation.
that's
what
we
have
here.
he
had
counsel
on
the
initial
appeal
and
agreed
--
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
oh,
no.
your
honor,
that's
nothing
to
do
with
this,
is
--
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
no,
your
honor.
i
don't
believe
the
court
took
that
position
in
this
case.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
your
honor,
i
believe
the
court
applied
the
standard
laid
down
by
this
court
in
chapman
that
the
question
is
whether
or
not
the
error
--
in
doing
the
error
whether
or
not
the
court
could
declare
a
belief
that
the
error
was
harmless
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
now,
in
applying
that
standard
laid
down
by
this
court.
certainly,
a
review
--
a
court
of
review
must
take
into
consideration
two
factors
--
two
factors
or
more.
one
is
the
nature
of
the
air
and
the
extent
of
it;
and
secondly,
the
nature
of
the
case.
and
that
i
believe
is
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
in
the
banks
case.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
yes,
earlier.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
well,
your
honor.
there
have
been
a
series
of
cases
before
the
california
appellate
courts
involving
the
man
from
this
court
and
all
possible
variations
occurred.
namely,
the
counsel
do
not
file
a
brief
but
they
do
file
a
brief
and
that
some
are
argued.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
and
the
results
also
vary
where
in
some
cases
there
is
no
argument
or
brief
nevertheless
the
case
may
be
reversed
depending
on
the
nature
of
the
case.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
well,
yes
your
honor.
however,
--
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
yes,
your
honor.
but
i
would
point
out
that
the
courts
have
depending
on
the
nature
of
the
comment
and
various
facts
and
circumstances.
they
have
both
reversed
and
affirmed
in
the
individual
cases.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
oh,
no
your
honor.
in
fact,
the
--
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
no,
your
honor.
the
more
common
order
i
would
say
is
merely
that
the
cause
is
submitted.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
and
in
the
--
in
the
letter
--
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
ah
--
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
no,
your
honor.
well,
there
was
also
a
brief
filed
by
the
petitioner
your
honor.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
no,
your
honor.
he
did
not.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
your
honor.
he
was
--
for
the
simple
reason
that
he
had
counsel,
your
honor,
and
that
in
such
a
situation.
the
defendant
does
not
present
the
argument.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
oh,
clearly.
yes,
your
honor.
in
other
words,
i
would
say
that
the
practice
and
in
courts
on
whether
or
not
you
argue
a
case
on
appeal
after
is
his
--
the
choice
made
counsel.
in
other
words
--
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
in
many
cases
your
honor,
in
which
the
--
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
well,
your
honor
that
would
--
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
yes,
that
would
be
up
the
individual
counsel.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
well,
your
honor.
in
the
situation
of
retained
counsel
that
you
speak
off,
retained
counsel
on
occasion
both
in
criminal
and
civil
cases
make
a
determination
not
to
orally
argue
the
case.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
no,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
it
was
originally
argued
by
counsel
your
honor
before
the
court.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
he
did
not
argue
the
chapman
issue
your
honor.
he
did
argue
the
entire
case
before
the
court
of
appeals
when
it
was
before
them.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
no,
your
honor.
on
the
--
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
however,
when
the
case
is
remanded
it's
back
before
the
court
as
a
current
appeal.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
he
filed
no
documents
with
the
court,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
no,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
your
honor,
as
all
i
know
the
question
of
oral
argument
is
that
it
is
not
required
in
every
case
and
that
as
a
matter
of
practice
oral
argument
in
the
court
of
appeals
in
california
in
many
cases
is
not
conducted.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
well,
your
honor
the
--
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
no,
i
think
it
merely
states
that
it
may
be
done
and
does
not
particularize
and
in
practice.
it
is
done
quite
often
to
even
phone
calls.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
well,
in
this
type
of
situation
your
honor,
namely
when
we're
dealing
with
the
equivalent
of
a
supplemental
brief
on
a
particular
point
as
distinguished
from
the
initial
original
appeal.
i
would
just
merely
--
in
referring
to
the
jurisdictional
--
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
yes,
your
honor.
alright,
but
then
the
next
question
is
that
of
the
affect
of
the
comment
in
this
case.
now,
it
is
necessary
to
look
both
at
the
comment
and
the
evidence
in
this
case
and
particularly
in
this
case.
unlike
most
cases
before
this
court
and
the
california
courts,
we
have
the
unusual
situation
that
the
petitioner
in
effect
attempted
to
testify
to
the
court
on
certain
matters
throughout
his
cross-examination
the
--
of
various
witnesses.
the
petitioner
made
testimonial
statements
concerning
his
actions
on
the
night
in
question
and
also
concerning
statements
of
witnesses.
the
court
--
the
prosecutor
objected
and
the
court
admonished
the
jury
to
the
effect
that
petitioner
had
not
taken
the
stand
and
that
the
statements
could
not
be
considered
as
testimony.
now,
this
court
has
held
in
the
cameron-eddie
cases
and
later
cases
that
the
privileges
against
self-incrimination
can
be
waived
when
a
defendant
elects
to
testify.
and
indeed
this
court
approved
a
comment
by
the
court
in
the
cameron-eddie
that
the
jury
could
consider
the
defendant's
failure
to
explain
acts
than
incriminating
nature
that
the
evidence
established
against
him
in
reaching
their
conclusion
as
to
guilt
or
innocence.
now
--
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
no,
your
honor.
but
it
is
before
this
court
as
to
whether
or
not
the
comment
in
this
case
was
erroneous
and
--
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
yes,
your
honor.
and
in
considering
--
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
yes,
it
does
your
honor.
now
referring
to
that
evidence,
the
evidence
shows
that
there
were
within
the
space
of
one
hour.
it
was
an
attempted
robbery
two
completed
robberies
and
an
aborted
robbery
committed
within
one
hour
in
oakland.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
in
oakland,
in
east
oakland,
california,
all
within
the
same
basic
geographical
area.
the
first
attempted
robbery
occurred
in
approximately
11
p.m.
at
vince's
liquors
which
involved
the
roger
wong
and
harry
jack.
the
plaintiff
walked
or
the
petitioner
walked
to
the
rear
counter
and
standing
three
feet
from
the
witnesses,
lifted
his
right
hand
in
his
coat
pocket
in
this
manner
and
said,
“give
me
all
your
money.”
he
then
rep
--
he
then
said,
“do
you
want
to
die?
give
me
all
your
money.”
when
wong
heard
this,
he
looked
at
petitioner
and
he
saw
the
pocketed
hand
on
the
counter.
wong
meant
to
pick
up
a
38
pistol
from
under
the
counter,
reached
over
and
he
struck
the
petitioner
on
his
pocketed
right
hand.
wong
then
ordered
the
petitioner
to
hold
his
hands
up
and
the
petitioner
said,
“go
ahead
and
shoot
me.”
but
mr.
wong
testified
that
he
just
could
not
shoot
the
man
and
the
petitioner
then
left
the
store.
fifteen
minutes
later
at
about
11:15,
the
petitioner
entered
the
three-point
liquor
store,
approached
the
clerk,
mr.
perry,
and
again
with
his
right
hand
in
his
pocket,
simulating
a
gun
said,
“hand
over
the
money.”
when
perry
did
not
respond,
petitioner
said,
“if
you
don't
want
to
jeopardize
your
life,
hand
over
the
money.
i'm
not
kidding.”
perry
then
--
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
mr.
perry,
the
witness
to
whom
he
was
demanding
the
money
identified
him
and
two
other
witnesses,
mr.
griffith
and
mr.
jones
who
were
in
the
store.
now,
mr.
griffith
was
standing
right
beside
the
petitioner
and
as
the
petitioner
then
left,
mr.
jones
came
and
in
fact,
bumped
into
him.
now,
both
mr.
perry
and
mr.
griffith
identified
the
petitioner
and
there's
no
question
about
there
identification
at
the
trial
level.
they
also
identified
him
at
the
line
up
and
were
--
mr.
perry
was
quite
positive
in
his
identification.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
well,
your
honor,
there
is
again
additional
he
then
robs,
the
petitioner
then
robs
the
linden
liquor
store
at
about
11:30.
and
at
that
point,
the
store
is
owned
by
mr.
polititch.
he
again
simulates
a
gun
in
his
right
hand,
contained
in
the
pocket
--
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
yes,
your
honor.
and
demands
the
money,
and
he
obtains
a
$165.00
including
$30.00
to
$41.00
bills.
as
he
was
--
as
the
petitioner
was
leaving
a
cust
--
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
the
owner
your
honor,
mr.
polititch.
finally,
15
minutes
later
approximately
12
before
midnight
--
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
no,
your
honor.
i'll
bring
that
out
in
--
it
in
that
the
robbery
occurred
at
11:30.
he
then
goes
to
sobic's
liquor
store
and
goes
into
the
store
and
asked
the
proprietor,
mr.
smith,
whether
he
had
a
gun.
smith
says,
“why
do
you
want
to
know?”
and
petitioner
says,
“well,
i
might
want
to
hold
you
up.”
just
then
officer
neilson
walks
into
the
store.
smith
tells
neilson
what
petitioner
had
said.
neilson
informs
him
that
there
had
been
some
robberies
in
the
area
and
says
to
banks'
buddy,
“you
fit
the
description.”
the
officer
then
arrested
him
and
in
searching
for
a
weapons.
they
discovered
various
currencies
in
1's,
5's,
and
10's
in
his
pockets.
the
officers
then
bring
the
petitioner
to
the
closest
store,
linden
liquors
which
mr.
polititch
owned.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
yes,
your
honor.
there
was
one
attempted
robbery,
two
completed
robberies,
and
one
aborted
robbery.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
and
there
was
a
total
of
six
witnesses
at
the
first
three
stores.
there
are
two
in
the
first
store,
three
in
the
second
store,
and
one
in
the
last
store.
they
then
bring
him
back
to
the
--
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
no,
your
honor.
no
alibi.
the
only
defense
and
it
was
a
very
weak
defense
presented
in
this
case
is
that
he
had
earned
money
at
a
prior
time.
and
even
that
when
examined
the
--
when
the
witnesses
are
examined,
they
are
confused
about
the
dates
and
about
the
amounts
of
money.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
none
whatsoever
your
honor.
after
he
was
then
--
the
petitioner
was
then
taken
to
the
last
store
and
mr.
polititch
identified
him
stating,
“that
is
the
man”.
he
was
then
taken
to
the
oakland
police
department.
the
officers
found
more
money
in
various
pockets
in
his
wallet.
for
a
total
of
a
$176.00
including
31
one
dollar
bills,
similar
to
the
amount
described
by
mr.
polititch.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
that's
correct
your
honor.
then
when
neilson
asked
petitioner
where
the
money
came
from.
petitioner
responded
that
he
had
cash
a
check
that
day.
he
never
attempted
to
show
the
cash
to
check
that
day
at
trial.
officer
neilson
still
concerned
about
the
gun
since
each
of
the
witnesses
had
mentioned
the
hand
covered
in
the
pocket
said,
“what
did
you
do
with
the
gun,
fred?”
petitioner
responded,
“i
didn't
have
a
gun.
if
i
had
one
i
would
probably
have
killed
somebody
tonight.
guns
make
me
very
nervous.”
now,
we
then
looked
at
the
comment
in
this
case.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
yes,
your
honor.
there
were
other
corroborating
circumstances
which
i
should
inform
the
court
of.
one
was
that
as
you
recall,
wong
at
the
time
he
was
being
robbed,
reached
over
and
hit
the
banks
on
his
hand
with
a
gun
because
he
couldn't
bring
himself
to
shoot
the
man.
after
he
positively
identified
banks
at
the
line
up,
he
have
requested
the
officer
to
look
at
his
hand.
he
looked
at
his
hand
and
there
was
a
black
spot
right
on
his
right
hand.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
that
was
the
right
hand
that
he
was
simulating
the
gun
in
the
robberies.
the
other
point
would
be
the
31
one
dollar
bills
similar
to
the
money
mrs.
--
mr.
polititch
described.
the
others,
the
statement
previously
mentioned
that
he
made
to
mr.
neilson
and
of
course
quite
important
is
the
seventh
witness,
namely
the
witness
to
the
aborted
robbery.
now,
there
this
can
possibly
be
no
question
about
the
identification
there
for
the
simply
reason
that
while
he's
starting
in
on
it,
the
police
come
in
and
he
again
had
made
the
statement
to
mr.
smith.
“i
might
want
to
hold
you
up.”
when
he
--
in
relation
to
his
question
whether
he
had
a
gun.
and
that
is
the
evidence
to
this
--
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
oh!
yes,
your
honor.
clearly,
for
the
simple
reason
that
in
this
case
the
appellate
court
has
reviewed
this
question,
in
light
of
chapman
and
it
has
come
to
the
conclusion
that
it
was
harmless
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt.
it
has
expressed
its
belief
as
required
by
this
court.
so
that
this
is
not
of
course
a
question
of
initial
review
or
the
question
of
the
application
of
the
standard
as
was
posed
to
this
court
in
chapman.
would
this
court
have
to
decide
both
the
standard
and
then
apply
it?
this
case,
the
standard
has
been
applied
by
a
court
of
review
and
it
has
come
to
the
determination
that
in
this
case
the
comments
were
harmless
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
your
honor,
i
--
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
i
believe
that
there
would
have
been
--
there
may
have
been
--
no,
your
honor,
i
believe
they
are
all
the
same.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
they
would
be
the
same
your
honor.
the
change
did
not
occur
until
after
that
time.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
second
division.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
that
is
the
basically
the
san
francisco
bay
area.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
alameda,
your
honor,
oakland,
right
across
the
bay.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
of
the
first
district
--
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
all
--
no,
there's
not
been
a
change
at
that
time.
there
has
been
subsequently
but
not
on
these
decisions.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
your
honor,
i
believe
that
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
applied
that
standard
and
--
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
pardon?
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
well,
then
your
honor,
we
then
get
into
a
question
of
what
these
courts
stated
in
chapman
and
the
--
in
that
situation,
this
court
stated
that
it
was
merely
a
restatement
of
the
original
of
fahey
standard.
namely,
whether
there
is
a
reasonable
possibility
the
evidence
complaint
of
might
have
contributed
to
the
conviction.
and
i
think
that
is
the
standard
that
was
applied
here
and
that
it
is
the
--
that
chapman
contemplated
a
review
by
the
reviewing
court
on
that
question
whether
or
not
--
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
oh,
your
honor
--
your
honor
as
a
minute
the
most
significant
part
namely
they
final
sentence,
namely
as
to
the
error
and
commenting
instructing
on
defendant's
failure
to
testify.
we
declare
belief
base
upon
the
conclusive
evidence
of
his
guilt
that
such
error
was
harmless
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt.
the
right
of
the
--
the
court
here
complied
with
the
remand
by
this
court
namely
to
consider
the
chapman
standard.
this
court
did
not
say
reverse
this
case.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
reviewing
court
makes
that
determination
and
in
some
cases
may
determine
to
proceed
in
that
matter.
but
in
other
case
would
proceed
in
the
manner
in
which
it
did
here
namely
sending
a
letter
to
counsel
and
petitioner
asking
whether
or
not
they
choose
to
submit
additional
written
arguments.
as
far
as
the
manner
in
which
they
treated
in
the
opinion,
i
think
they
have
applied
this
standard.
now,
it
would
seem
to
me
to
be
a
manner
of
discretion
with
the
state
courts
as
to
whether
or
not
they
go
through
an
extended
opinion
pointing
out
the
precise
nature
of
the
comment,
the
circumstances
surrounding
it
and
then
referring
to
the
evidence.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
oh,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
no.
there
are
not
--
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
well
--
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
well,
your
honor,
i
would
actually
say
that
they
have
done
it
in
every
case
that
i'm
familiar
with
namely,
send
--
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
send
it
--
yes,
your
honor.
sending
letters
stating
that
the
case
has
been
remanded.
now,
quite
often
counsel
on
the
case
will
not
receive
the
documents
from
this
court
of
remand.
they
go
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
are
not
necessarily
the
counsel
on
the
case
is
not
necessarily
advice
to
that.
depending
on
whether
or
not
of
course
he
was
on
the
petition
for
certiorari
but
the
--
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
no,
your
honor.
it
is
basically
by
way
as
in
this
case,
by
way
of
a
letter
advising
him
of
the
situation
and
then
asking
whether
or
not
they
wish
to
submit
additional
written
argument.
that
is
the
basic
practice
that
i'm
acquainted
with
in
both
the
both
the
first
district
and
for
that
matter
other
districts.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
yes,
your
honor.
there's
a
letter
to
the
lawyer
which
states
precisely
that.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
yes,
i
can
your
honor.
page
326
your
honor
would
be
one
example
in
which
the
--
a
letter
to
mr.
banks
with
a
cc:
to
mr.
chapsky
states,
the
united
states
supreme
court
is
vacated
the
judgment
of
this
court
and
the
above
entitled
case
and
it
is
remanded
the
case
to
us
for
further
proceedings
in
light
of
griffin
versus
california.
this
court
wishes
to
know
whether
the
jury
desire
to
submit
anything
further
to
the
court
by
way
of
written
argument
before
we
proceed
to
decide
the
case
pursuant
to
the
directions
the
united
states
supreme
court
--
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
well,
yes
your
honor.
there
is
a
similar
letter
on
the
current
one
in
which
it
states.
enclose
is
a
copy
of
an
order
vacating
the
submission
granting
you
30
days
within
which
to
file
a
supplemental
brief.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
that
is
page
337
your
honor.
in
as
much
as
this
case
has
been
restored
to
our
lists
of
active
cases
by
order
united
states
supreme
court.
mr.
robert
chapsky
continues
to
represent
you
and
no
other
attorney
will
be
appointed
as
place.
if
mr.
chapsky
desires
to
file
a
further
brief
in
your
behalf,
he
will
be
permitted
to
do
so.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
yes,
your
honor.
as
--
in
other
words,
the
letter
i
just
read
is
in
reply
to
that
that
mr.
chapsky
is
his
counsel.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
not
when
he's
represented
by
counsel
your
honor.
in
other
words,
the
basic
case
is
hold
that
you
have
a
right
to
one
of
two
things
either
a
right
to
counsel
or
right
to
defend
a
pro
se.
one
or
the
other
you
are
not
entitled
to
a
high
breadth
of
those
two.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
yes,
when
there's
a
substantial
reason
given
your
honor.
yes.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
yes.
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
no,
your
honor.
i
was
not
here.
if
i
have
been
here,
i
would
have
called
it
to
this
court's
attention.
and
certainly,
there
are
cases
before
this
court
decided
by
this
court
without
any
briefing
or
argument
on
a
given
point.
certainly,
the
recent
case
of
robert
versus
russell
is
an
outstanding
example
wherein
this
court
had
neither
brief
nor
argument
before
deciding
that
particular
issue.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
i
beg
your
pardon
your
honor.
no
--
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
no
brief
discussing
the
issue
of
retroactivity
or
oral
argument.
i
should
--
to
be
more
correct
that
there
is
no
--
the
basic
decision
in
the
roberts
was
that
proving
would
be
retroactive.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
well,
your
honor,
the
burden
is
clearly
on
the
prosecution
in
effect
to
show
that
the
--
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
in
this
case,
your
honor?
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
yes,
your
honor.
it
submitted
a
letter
--
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
oh,
your
honor,
this
court
was
the
one
--
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
yes,
your
honor.
for
the
simple
reason
that
this
court
said
that
the
standard
laid
down
in
chapman
was
nothing
in
effect,
it
was
in
effect
a
rephrasing
of
the
very
standard
in
fahey
and
i
don't
think
that
in
the
--
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
yes,
your
honor.
for
the
simple
reason
that
--
that
the
--
that
in
chapman,
this
court
was
merely
in
effect
was
rephrasing
it
stating
that
it
was
the
--
stating
there's
little
--
if
any
difference
between
our
statement
in
fahey
and
the
standard
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt.
and
i
think
that
it
is
not
incumbent
upon
each
--
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
yes,
they
did
your
honor.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
i
believe
it
is
your
honor,
for
the
simple
reason
that
otherwise,
this
court
would
then
require
every
appellate
court
in
this
--
throughout
the
nation
to
state
not
only
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt
but
further
there
is
no
reasonable
possibility
that
the
evidence
complained
of
might
have
contributed
to
the
conviction.
then
we
would
--
then
this
court
would
then
be
requiring
--
it
would
seem
to
me
merely
a
semantic
paradigm
by
the
reviewing
courts
throughout
this
nation
to
comply
with
this
court's
decision
in
chapman.
and
i
for
one
think
that
this
court
was
rather
clear
in
chapman.
and
that
the
courts
in
california
have
attempted
to
comply
with
this
court's
ruling
and
i
think
that
the
banks
case
is
no
exception
to
that.
i
would
just
as
my
time
is
--
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
yes,
your
honor.
that
statement
is
clearly
incorrect.
the
state
of
the
--
the
law
itself
that
every
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
california.
you
have
a
right
to
discretionary
review.
the
two
cases
decided
by
counsel
merely
state
that
the
supreme
court
has
no
jurisdiction
to
review
a
court
of
appeals
after
the
statutory
60-day
period
is
expired.
obviously,
that
is
true
of
any
basic
review
including
the
certiorari
of
this
court.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
either
not
--
not
of
the
trial
court
your
honor.
this
is
merely
--
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
oh,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
yes,
your
honor.
it's
the
decision
that
rendered
by
the
--
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
well,
that
is
--
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
--
that
is
the
judgment
your
honor
which
became
final
with
a
60-day
as
to
the
state
court,
60
days
after
its
rendition.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
no,
your
honor.
the
only
thing
is
at
the
time
it
becomes
final,
a
remittitur
is
issued
to
the
trial
court
which
occurred
in
the
--
on
--
well,
all
three
occasions
in
this
situation.
the
time
of
initial
affirmance
--
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
yes,
your
honor.
i
believe
they
are.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
but
its
by
law,
they
are
issued
--
when
the
case
becomes
final
which
unless
the
supreme
court
grants
a
hearing,
60
days
after
--
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
you
petition
from
--
you
actually
petition
from
the
judgment
of
the
trial
court.
in
the
sense
that
if
the
petition
for
hearing
is
granted
then
the
--
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
oh,
he
did
go
there
your
honor
and
a
hearing
was
denied.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
no.
well,
your
honor,
on
that
--
no,
perhaps
i
misstated
that.
he
petitions
for
hearing
based
upon
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeal.
in
other
words,
the
common
thing
in
the
petition
for
hearing
is
to
point
out
why
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
incorrect.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
that's
correct,
from
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeal.
the
only
--
the
reason
i
had
perhaps
misspoken
is
that
if
the
supreme
court
grants
the
hearing,
it
then
in
effect
negates
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeal.
but
the
petition
for
hearing
is
from
the
decision
of
the
intermediate
--
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
oh
yes,
your
honor.
there
is
no
question
here
that
the
he
clearly
have
the
right
to
seek
review
in
the
supreme
court.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
oh,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
well,
i
know
one
case
in
which
people
versus
boyd,
i
believe
it
is.
in
which
this
court
re
--
while
the
conviction
was
affirmed
in
59,
it
was
then
--
he
reinstituted
it
based
on
douglas
in
64,
came
up
here
and
was
remanded
in
light
of
chapman.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
to
the
district
court
of
appeal.
there
the
petitioner
--
petition
for
hearing,
he
was
denied.
he
then
petitioned
for
a
certiorari
in
this
court
and
this
court
denied
the
petition
for
certiorari.
now,
that
is
--
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
oh
yes,
your
honor.
it's
clear
that
the
--
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
alright,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
well,
your
honor,
i
think
i
can
forward
to
this
court
in
case
in
which
the
supreme
court
did
review
it.
the
only
thing
i
don't
know
about
that
particular
case
is
whether
or
not
it
was
done
pursuant
to
a
remand
from
this
case.
but
it
did
involve
a
chapman
type
issue
and
a
hearing
was
granted
on
it.
as
to
the
question
of
the
california
supreme
court's
being
able
to
review
the
--
this
judgment.
i
think
there's
no
question
about
it
based
on
the
constitution
and
laws
that
set
forth
in
out
brief.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
mr.
chief
justice,
just
in
connect
with
1253.
i
would
call
that
to
the
court's
attention
for
the
simple
reason
that
it
says
may
be
affirmed,
if
the
appellate
fails
to
appear
but
can
be
reversed
only
after
argument,
though,
the
respondent
fails
to
appear.
in
other
words,
that
is
the
situation
wherein
the
respondent
state
in
the
criminal
case
have
a
--
may
argue
the
case
but
there
isn't
the
equivalent
situation
with
regard
to
the
appellant
and
the
1253
therefore
does
not
govern
in
this
situation.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
thank
you.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
initial
point
that
i
wish
to
bring
to
this
court's
attention
is
that
of
this
court's
jurisdiction
to
review
the
present
case.
this
court's
jurisdiction
in
reviewing
state
courts'
decisions
is
of
course
limited
to
those
judgments
rendered
by
the
highest
court
of
a
state
in
which
decision
could
be
held.
after
this
court
remanded,
the
banks
case
to
be
reviewed
in
light
of
chapman.
the
court
of
appeals
of
california
rendered
its
position
on
october
2,
1967.
the
petitioner
did
not
thereafter
petition
for
a
hearing
in
the
california
supreme
court.
it
is
well
settled
that
the
judgment
of
an
intermediate
appellate
court
is
not
that
of
a
highest
state
court
where
discretionary
review
is
available
and
not
sought.
that
is
precisely
the
situation
here
under
california
constitution
and
laws.
the
california
supreme
court
has
discretionary
power
to
review
the
court
of
appeals.
and
therefore,
the
judgment
in
this
case
is
not
of
the
highest
court
of
state.
the
petitioner
--
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
yes,
your
honor.
on
the
remand,
he
sent
a
letter
into
the
court
of
appeals
stating
that
he
wished
a
second
counsel
or
a
different
counsel
and
gave
as
his
reason
that
the
counsel,
his
appointed
counsel
on
the
original
appeal
decided
in
1964
did
not
raise
the
griffin
constitutional
issue.
but
the
court
of
appeals
answered
petitioner's
letter
and
pointed
out
to
him
that
he
was
not
in
effect
that
he
could
not
expect
counsel
to
anticipate
that
to
be
clairvoyant
to
spot
the
griffin
issue
in
1964.
indeed,
this
court
has
said
as
much
in
the
o'connor
versus
ohio
case
and
he
gave
no
other
reason
to
the
court
of
appeals
as
to
why
he
should
be
entitled
to
a
second
or
different
counsel.
in
the
reply
brief
and
an
effort
to
avoid
the
--
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
the
appointed
counsel
your
honor
on
--
at
the
time
of
the
remand
did
not
file
a
brief.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
ah,
he
filed
nothing
--
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
he
filed
nothing
with
the
court,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
no,
your
honor.
there
was
no
argument
in
the
case.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
yes,
your
honor.
he
did.
he
had
--
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
he
had
been
appointed
counsel,
mr.
chapsky,
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
on
each
remand.
the
court
of
appeals
informed
both
the
petitioner
and
his
counsel
that
if
they
wish
they
could
submit
additional
written
argument
on
the
griffin
and
the
chapman
issue.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
yes,
your
honor,
in
the
sense
that
he
had
appointed
counsel
and
then
it
was
a
choice
by
counsel
as
to
whether
or
not
to
file
a
supplemental
brief
on
the
chapman
case.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
to
--
for
the
court
of
appeals
to
review
in
light
of
chapman.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
yes,
your
honor.
they
would
be.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
oh,
yes.
i
am
--
well,
i
dispute
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
petitioner
--
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
he
did
not
write
anything
to
the
court,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
no,
your
honor.
he
did
not.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
yes,
your
honor.
the
question
being
in
other
words
we
can
take
a
case
in
which
the
cases
before
the
court
and
while
it
is
before
that
court
a
decision
by
this
court
or
perhaps
by
the
california
supreme
court
comes
down.
and
the
question
would
be,
is
there
a
duty
on
the
part
of
counsel
whether
retained
or
appointed
to
file
a
supplemental
brief
on
this
case
which
has
impact
on
that
appeal.
now,
i
think
in
that
situation
that
due
process
does
not
require
an
automatic
brief
supplemental
brief
to
be
filed
in
that
situation.
that's
what
we
have
here.
he
had
counsel
on
the
initial
appeal
and
agreed
--
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
oh,
no.
your
honor,
that's
nothing
to
do
with
this,
is
--
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
no,
your
honor.
i
don't
believe
the
court
took
that
position
in
this
case.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
your
honor,
i
believe
the
court
applied
the
standard
laid
down
by
this
court
in
chapman
that
the
question
is
whether
or
not
the
error
--
in
doing
the
error
whether
or
not
the
court
could
declare
a
belief
that
the
error
was
harmless
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
now,
in
applying
that
standard
laid
down
by
this
court.
certainly,
a
review
--
a
court
of
review
must
take
into
consideration
two
factors
--
two
factors
or
more.
one
is
the
nature
of
the
air
and
the
extent
of
it;
and
secondly,
the
nature
of
the
case.
and
that
i
believe
is
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
in
the
banks
case.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
yes,
earlier.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
well,
your
honor.
there
have
been
a
series
of
cases
before
the
california
appellate
courts
involving
the
man
from
this
court
and
all
possible
variations
occurred.
namely,
the
counsel
do
not
file
a
brief
but
they
do
file
a
brief
and
that
some
are
argued.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
and
the
results
also
vary
where
in
some
cases
there
is
no
argument
or
brief
nevertheless
the
case
may
be
reversed
depending
on
the
nature
of
the
case.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
well,
yes
your
honor.
however,
--
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
yes,
your
honor.
but
i
would
point
out
that
the
courts
have
depending
on
the
nature
of
the
comment
and
various
facts
and
circumstances.
they
have
both
reversed
and
affirmed
in
the
individual
cases.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
oh,
no
your
honor.
in
fact,
the
--
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
no,
your
honor.
the
more
common
order
i
would
say
is
merely
that
the
cause
is
submitted.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
and
in
the
--
in
the
letter
--
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
ah
--
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
no,
your
honor.
well,
there
was
also
a
brief
filed
by
the
petitioner
your
honor.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
no,
your
honor.
he
did
not.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
your
honor.
he
was
--
for
the
simple
reason
that
he
had
counsel,
your
honor,
and
that
in
such
a
situation.
the
defendant
does
not
present
the
argument.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
oh,
clearly.
yes,
your
honor.
in
other
words,
i
would
say
that
the
practice
and
in
courts
on
whether
or
not
you
argue
a
case
on
appeal
after
is
his
--
the
choice
made
counsel.
in
other
words
--
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
in
many
cases
your
honor,
in
which
the
--
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
well,
your
honor
that
would
--
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
yes,
that
would
be
up
the
individual
counsel.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
well,
your
honor.
in
the
situation
of
retained
counsel
that
you
speak
off,
retained
counsel
on
occasion
both
in
criminal
and
civil
cases
make
a
determination
not
to
orally
argue
the
case.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
no,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
it
was
originally
argued
by
counsel
your
honor
before
the
court.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
he
did
not
argue
the
chapman
issue
your
honor.
he
did
argue
the
entire
case
before
the
court
of
appeals
when
it
was
before
them.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
no,
your
honor.
on
the
--
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
however,
when
the
case
is
remanded
it's
back
before
the
court
as
a
current
appeal.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
he
filed
no
documents
with
the
court,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
no,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
your
honor,
as
all
i
know
the
question
of
oral
argument
is
that
it
is
not
required
in
every
case
and
that
as
a
matter
of
practice
oral
argument
in
the
court
of
appeals
in
california
in
many
cases
is
not
conducted.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
well,
your
honor
the
--
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
no,
i
think
it
merely
states
that
it
may
be
done
and
does
not
particularize
and
in
practice.
it
is
done
quite
often
to
even
phone
calls.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
well,
in
this
type
of
situation
your
honor,
namely
when
we're
dealing
with
the
equivalent
of
a
supplemental
brief
on
a
particular
point
as
distinguished
from
the
initial
original
appeal.
i
would
just
merely
--
in
referring
to
the
jurisdictional
--
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
yes,
your
honor.
alright,
but
then
the
next
question
is
that
of
the
affect
of
the
comment
in
this
case.
now,
it
is
necessary
to
look
both
at
the
comment
and
the
evidence
in
this
case
and
particularly
in
this
case.
unlike
most
cases
before
this
court
and
the
california
courts,
we
have
the
unusual
situation
that
the
petitioner
in
effect
attempted
to
testify
to
the
court
on
certain
matters
throughout
his
cross-examination
the
--
of
various
witnesses.
the
petitioner
made
testimonial
statements
concerning
his
actions
on
the
night
in
question
and
also
concerning
statements
of
witnesses.
the
court
--
the
prosecutor
objected
and
the
court
admonished
the
jury
to
the
effect
that
petitioner
had
not
taken
the
stand
and
that
the
statements
could
not
be
considered
as
testimony.
now,
this
court
has
held
in
the
cameron-eddie
cases
and
later
cases
that
the
privileges
against
self-incrimination
can
be
waived
when
a
defendant
elects
to
testify.
and
indeed
this
court
approved
a
comment
by
the
court
in
the
cameron-eddie
that
the
jury
could
consider
the
defendant's
failure
to
explain
acts
than
incriminating
nature
that
the
evidence
established
against
him
in
reaching
their
conclusion
as
to
guilt
or
innocence.
now
--
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
no,
your
honor.
but
it
is
before
this
court
as
to
whether
or
not
the
comment
in
this
case
was
erroneous
and
--
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
yes,
your
honor.
and
in
considering
--
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
yes,
it
does
your
honor.
now
referring
to
that
evidence,
the
evidence
shows
that
there
were
within
the
space
of
one
hour.
it
was
an
attempted
robbery
two
completed
robberies
and
an
aborted
robbery
committed
within
one
hour
in
oakland.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
in
oakland,
in
east
oakland,
california,
all
within
the
same
basic
geographical
area.
the
first
attempted
robbery
occurred
in
approximately
11
p.m.
at
vince's
liquors
which
involved
the
roger
wong
and
harry
jack.
the
plaintiff
walked
or
the
petitioner
walked
to
the
rear
counter
and
standing
three
feet
from
the
witnesses,
lifted
his
right
hand
in
his
coat
pocket
in
this
manner
and
said,
“give
me
all
your
money.”
he
then
rep
--
he
then
said,
“do
you
want
to
die?
give
me
all
your
money.”
when
wong
heard
this,
he
looked
at
petitioner
and
he
saw
the
pocketed
hand
on
the
counter.
wong
meant
to
pick
up
a
38
pistol
from
under
the
counter,
reached
over
and
he
struck
the
petitioner
on
his
pocketed
right
hand.
wong
then
ordered
the
petitioner
to
hold
his
hands
up
and
the
petitioner
said,
“go
ahead
and
shoot
me.”
but
mr.
wong
testified
that
he
just
could
not
shoot
the
man
and
the
petitioner
then
left
the
store.
fifteen
minutes
later
at
about
11:15,
the
petitioner
entered
the
three-point
liquor
store,
approached
the
clerk,
mr.
perry,
and
again
with
his
right
hand
in
his
pocket,
simulating
a
gun
said,
“hand
over
the
money.”
when
perry
did
not
respond,
petitioner
said,
“if
you
don't
want
to
jeopardize
your
life,
hand
over
the
money.
i'm
not
kidding.”
perry
then
--
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
mr.
perry,
the
witness
to
whom
he
was
demanding
the
money
identified
him
and
two
other
witnesses,
mr.
griffith
and
mr.
jones
who
were
in
the
store.
now,
mr.
griffith
was
standing
right
beside
the
petitioner
and
as
the
petitioner
then
left,
mr.
jones
came
and
in
fact,
bumped
into
him.
now,
both
mr.
perry
and
mr.
griffith
identified
the
petitioner
and
there's
no
question
about
there
identification
at
the
trial
level.
they
also
identified
him
at
the
line
up
and
were
--
mr.
perry
was
quite
positive
in
his
identification.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
well,
your
honor,
there
is
again
additional
he
then
robs,
the
petitioner
then
robs
the
linden
liquor
store
at
about
11:30.
and
at
that
point,
the
store
is
owned
by
mr.
polititch.
he
again
simulates
a
gun
in
his
right
hand,
contained
in
the
pocket
--
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
yes,
your
honor.
and
demands
the
money,
and
he
obtains
a
$165.00
including
$30.00
to
$41.00
bills.
as
he
was
--
as
the
petitioner
was
leaving
a
cust
--
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
the
owner
your
honor,
mr.
polititch.
finally,
15
minutes
later
approximately
12
before
midnight
--
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
no,
your
honor.
i'll
bring
that
out
in
--
it
in
that
the
robbery
occurred
at
11:30.
he
then
goes
to
sobic's
liquor
store
and
goes
into
the
store
and
asked
the
proprietor,
mr.
smith,
whether
he
had
a
gun.
smith
says,
“why
do
you
want
to
know?”
and
petitioner
says,
“well,
i
might
want
to
hold
you
up.”
just
then
officer
neilson
walks
into
the
store.
smith
tells
neilson
what
petitioner
had
said.
neilson
informs
him
that
there
had
been
some
robberies
in
the
area
and
says
to
banks'
buddy,
“you
fit
the
description.”
the
officer
then
arrested
him
and
in
searching
for
a
weapons.
they
discovered
various
currencies
in
1's,
5's,
and
10's
in
his
pockets.
the
officers
then
bring
the
petitioner
to
the
closest
store,
linden
liquors
which
mr.
polititch
owned.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
yes,
your
honor.
there
was
one
attempted
robbery,
two
completed
robberies,
and
one
aborted
robbery.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
and
there
was
a
total
of
six
witnesses
at
the
first
three
stores.
there
are
two
in
the
first
store,
three
in
the
second
store,
and
one
in
the
last
store.
they
then
bring
him
back
to
the
--
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
no,
your
honor.
no
alibi.
the
only
defense
and
it
was
a
very
weak
defense
presented
in
this
case
is
that
he
had
earned
money
at
a
prior
time.
and
even
that
when
examined
the
--
when
the
witnesses
are
examined,
they
are
confused
about
the
dates
and
about
the
amounts
of
money.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
none
whatsoever
your
honor.
after
he
was
then
--
the
petitioner
was
then
taken
to
the
last
store
and
mr.
polititch
identified
him
stating,
“that
is
the
man”.
he
was
then
taken
to
the
oakland
police
department.
the
officers
found
more
money
in
various
pockets
in
his
wallet.
for
a
total
of
a
$176.00
including
31
one
dollar
bills,
similar
to
the
amount
described
by
mr.
polititch.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
that's
correct
your
honor.
then
when
neilson
asked
petitioner
where
the
money
came
from.
petitioner
responded
that
he
had
cash
a
check
that
day.
he
never
attempted
to
show
the
cash
to
check
that
day
at
trial.
officer
neilson
still
concerned
about
the
gun
since
each
of
the
witnesses
had
mentioned
the
hand
covered
in
the
pocket
said,
“what
did
you
do
with
the
gun,
fred?”
petitioner
responded,
“i
didn't
have
a
gun.
if
i
had
one
i
would
probably
have
killed
somebody
tonight.
guns
make
me
very
nervous.”
now,
we
then
looked
at
the
comment
in
this
case.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
yes,
your
honor.
there
were
other
corroborating
circumstances
which
i
should
inform
the
court
of.
one
was
that
as
you
recall,
wong
at
the
time
he
was
being
robbed,
reached
over
and
hit
the
banks
on
his
hand
with
a
gun
because
he
couldn't
bring
himself
to
shoot
the
man.
after
he
positively
identified
banks
at
the
line
up,
he
have
requested
the
officer
to
look
at
his
hand.
he
looked
at
his
hand
and
there
was
a
black
spot
right
on
his
right
hand.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
that
was
the
right
hand
that
he
was
simulating
the
gun
in
the
robberies.
the
other
point
would
be
the
31
one
dollar
bills
similar
to
the
money
mrs.
--
mr.
polititch
described.
the
others,
the
statement
previously
mentioned
that
he
made
to
mr.
neilson
and
of
course
quite
important
is
the
seventh
witness,
namely
the
witness
to
the
aborted
robbery.
now,
there
this
can
possibly
be
no
question
about
the
identification
there
for
the
simply
reason
that
while
he's
starting
in
on
it,
the
police
come
in
and
he
again
had
made
the
statement
to
mr.
smith.
“i
might
want
to
hold
you
up.”
when
he
--
in
relation
to
his
question
whether
he
had
a
gun.
and
that
is
the
evidence
to
this
--
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
oh!
yes,
your
honor.
clearly,
for
the
simple
reason
that
in
this
case
the
appellate
court
has
reviewed
this
question,
in
light
of
chapman
and
it
has
come
to
the
conclusion
that
it
was
harmless
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt.
it
has
expressed
its
belief
as
required
by
this
court.
so
that
this
is
not
of
course
a
question
of
initial
review
or
the
question
of
the
application
of
the
standard
as
was
posed
to
this
court
in
chapman.
would
this
court
have
to
decide
both
the
standard
and
then
apply
it?
this
case,
the
standard
has
been
applied
by
a
court
of
review
and
it
has
come
to
the
determination
that
in
this
case
the
comments
were
harmless
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
your
honor,
i
--
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
i
believe
that
there
would
have
been
--
there
may
have
been
--
no,
your
honor,
i
believe
they
are
all
the
same.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
they
would
be
the
same
your
honor.
the
change
did
not
occur
until
after
that
time.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
second
division.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
that
is
the
basically
the
san
francisco
bay
area.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
alameda,
your
honor,
oakland,
right
across
the
bay.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
of
the
first
district
--
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
all
--
no,
there's
not
been
a
change
at
that
time.
there
has
been
subsequently
but
not
on
these
decisions.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
your
honor,
i
believe
that
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
applied
that
standard
and
--
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
pardon?
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
well,
then
your
honor,
we
then
get
into
a
question
of
what
these
courts
stated
in
chapman
and
the
--
in
that
situation,
this
court
stated
that
it
was
merely
a
restatement
of
the
original
of
fahey
standard.
namely,
whether
there
is
a
reasonable
possibility
the
evidence
complaint
of
might
have
contributed
to
the
conviction.
and
i
think
that
is
the
standard
that
was
applied
here
and
that
it
is
the
--
that
chapman
contemplated
a
review
by
the
reviewing
court
on
that
question
whether
or
not
--
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
oh,
your
honor
--
your
honor
as
a
minute
the
most
significant
part
namely
they
final
sentence,
namely
as
to
the
error
and
commenting
instructing
on
defendant's
failure
to
testify.
we
declare
belief
base
upon
the
conclusive
evidence
of
his
guilt
that
such
error
was
harmless
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt.
the
right
of
the
--
the
court
here
complied
with
the
remand
by
this
court
namely
to
consider
the
chapman
standard.
this
court
did
not
say
reverse
this
case.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
reviewing
court
makes
that
determination
and
in
some
cases
may
determine
to
proceed
in
that
matter.
but
in
other
case
would
proceed
in
the
manner
in
which
it
did
here
namely
sending
a
letter
to
counsel
and
petitioner
asking
whether
or
not
they
choose
to
submit
additional
written
arguments.
as
far
as
the
manner
in
which
they
treated
in
the
opinion,
i
think
they
have
applied
this
standard.
now,
it
would
seem
to
me
to
be
a
manner
of
discretion
with
the
state
courts
as
to
whether
or
not
they
go
through
an
extended
opinion
pointing
out
the
precise
nature
of
the
comment,
the
circumstances
surrounding
it
and
then
referring
to
the
evidence.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
oh,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
no.
there
are
not
--
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
well
--
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
well,
your
honor,
i
would
actually
say
that
they
have
done
it
in
every
case
that
i'm
familiar
with
namely,
send
--
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
send
it
--
yes,
your
honor.
sending
letters
stating
that
the
case
has
been
remanded.
now,
quite
often
counsel
on
the
case
will
not
receive
the
documents
from
this
court
of
remand.
they
go
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
are
not
necessarily
the
counsel
on
the
case
is
not
necessarily
advice
to
that.
depending
on
whether
or
not
of
course
he
was
on
the
petition
for
certiorari
but
the
--
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
no,
your
honor.
it
is
basically
by
way
as
in
this
case,
by
way
of
a
letter
advising
him
of
the
situation
and
then
asking
whether
or
not
they
wish
to
submit
additional
written
argument.
that
is
the
basic
practice
that
i'm
acquainted
with
in
both
the
both
the
first
district
and
for
that
matter
other
districts.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
yes,
your
honor.
there's
a
letter
to
the
lawyer
which
states
precisely
that.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
yes,
i
can

your
honor
would
be
one
example
in
which
the
--
a
letter
to
mr.
banks
with
a
cc:
to
mr.
chapsky
states,
the
united
states
supreme
court
is
vacated
the
judgment
of
this
court
and
the
above
entitled
case
and
it
is
remanded
the
case
to
us
for
further
proceedings
in
light
of
griffin
versus
california.
this
court
wishes
to
know
whether
the
jury
desire
to
submit
anything
further
to
the
court
by
way
of
written
argument
before
we
proceed
to
decide
the
case
pursuant
to
the
directions
the
united
states
supreme
court
--
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
well,
yes
your
honor.
there
is
a
similar
letter
on
the
current
one
in
which
it
states.
enclose
is
a
copy
of
an
order
vacating
the
submission
granting
you
30
days
within
which
to
file
a
supplemental
brief.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
that
is
page
337
your
honor.
in
as
much
as
this
case
has
been
restored
to
our
lists
of
active
cases
by
order
united
states
supreme
court.
mr.
robert
chapsky
continues
to
represent
you
and
no
other
attorney
will
be
appointed
as
place.
if
mr.
chapsky
desires
to
file
a
further
brief
in
your
behalf,
he
will
be
permitted
to
do
so.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
yes,
your
honor.
as
--
in
other
words,
the
letter
i
just
read
is
in
reply
to
that
that
mr.
chapsky
is
his
counsel.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
not
when
he's
represented
by
counsel
your
honor.
in
other
words,
the
basic
case
is
hold
that
you
have
a
right
to
one
of
two
things
either
a
right
to
counsel
or
right
to
defend
a
pro
se.
one
or
the
other
you
are
not
entitled
to
a
high
breadth
of
those
two.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
yes,
when
there's
a
substantial
reason
given
your
honor.
yes.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
yes.
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
no,
your
honor.
i
was
not
here.
if
i
have
been
here,
i
would
have
called
it
to
this
court's
attention.
and
certainly,
there
are
cases
before
this
court
decided
by
this
court
without
any
briefing
or
argument
on
a
given
point.
certainly,
the
recent
case
of
robert
versus
russell
is
an
outstanding
example
wherein
this
court
had
neither
brief
nor
argument
before
deciding
that
particular
issue.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
i
beg
your
pardon
your
honor.
no
--
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
no
brief
discussing
the
issue
of
retroactivity
or
oral
argument.
i
should
--
to
be
more
correct
that
there
is
no
--
the
basic
decision
in
the
roberts
was
that
proving
would
be
retroactive.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
well,
your
honor,
the
burden
is
clearly
on
the
prosecution
in
effect
to
show
that
the
--
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
in
this
case,
your
honor?
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
yes,
your
honor.
it
submitted
a
letter
--
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
oh,
your
honor,
this
court
was
the
one
--
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
yes,
your
honor.
for
the
simple
reason
that
this
court
said
that
the
standard
laid
down
in
chapman
was
nothing
in
effect,
it
was
in
effect
a
rephrasing
of
the
very
standard
in
fahey
and
i
don't
think
that
in
the
--
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
yes,
your
honor.
for
the
simple
reason
that
--
that
the
--
that
in
chapman,
this
court
was
merely
in
effect
was
rephrasing
it
stating
that
it
was
the
--
stating
there's
little
--
if
any
difference
between
our
statement
in
fahey
and
the
standard
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt.
and
i
think
that
it
is
not
incumbent
upon
each
--
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
yes,
they
did
your
honor.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
i
believe
it
is
your
honor,
for
the
simple
reason
that
otherwise,
this
court
would
then
require
every
appellate
court
in
this
--
throughout
the
nation
to
state
not
only
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt
but
further
there
is
no
reasonable
possibility
that
the
evidence
complained
of
might
have
contributed
to
the
conviction.
then
we
would
--
then
this
court
would
then
be
requiring
--
it
would
seem
to
me
merely
a
semantic
paradigm
by
the
reviewing
courts
throughout
this
nation
to
comply
with
this
court's
decision
in
chapman.
and
i
for
one
think
that
this
court
was
rather
clear
in
chapman.
and
that
the
courts
in
california
have
attempted
to
comply
with
this
court's
ruling
and
i
think
that
the
banks
case
is
no
exception
to
that.
i
would
just
as
my
time
is
--
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
yes,
your
honor.
that
statement
is
clearly
incorrect.
the
state
of
the
--
the
law
itself
that
every
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
california.
you
have
a
right
to
discretionary
review.
the
two
cases
decided
by
counsel
merely
state
that
the
supreme
court
has
no
jurisdiction
to
review
a
court
of
appeals
after
the
statutory
60-day
period
is
expired.
obviously,
that
is
true
of
any
basic
review
including
the
certiorari
of
this
court.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
either
not
--
not
of
the
trial
court
your
honor.
this
is
merely
--
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
oh,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
yes,
your
honor.
it's
the
decision
that
rendered
by
the
--
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
well,
that
is
--
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
--
that
is
the
judgment
your
honor
which
became
final
with
a
60-day
as
to
the
state
court,
60
days
after
its
rendition.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
no,
your
honor.
the
only
thing
is
at
the
time
it
becomes
final,
a
remittitur
is
issued
to
the
trial
court
which
occurred
in
the
--
on
--
well,
all
three
occasions
in
this
situation.
the
time
of
initial
affirmance
--
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
yes,
your
honor.
i
believe
they
are.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
but
its
by
law,
they
are
issued
--
when
the
case
becomes
final
which
unless
the
supreme
court
grants
a
hearing,
60
days
after
--
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
you
petition
from
--
you
actually
petition
from
the
judgment
of
the
trial
court.
in
the
sense
that
if
the
petition
for
hearing
is
granted
then
the
--
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
oh,
he
did
go
there
your
honor
and
a
hearing
was
denied.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
no.
well,
your
honor,
on
that
--
no,
perhaps
i
misstated
that.
he
petitions
for
hearing
based
upon
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeal.
in
other
words,
the
common
thing
in
the
petition
for
hearing
is
to
point
out
why
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
incorrect.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
that's
correct,
from
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeal.
the
only
--
the
reason
i
had
perhaps
misspoken
is
that
if
the
supreme
court
grants
the
hearing,
it
then
in
effect
negates
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeal.
but
the
petition
for
hearing
is
from
the
decision
of
the
intermediate
--
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
oh
yes,
your
honor.
there
is
no
question
here
that
the
he
clearly
have
the
right
to
seek
review
in
the
supreme
court.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
oh,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
well,
i
know
one
case
in
which
people
versus
boyd,
i
believe
it
is.
in
which
this
court
re
--
while
the
conviction
was
affirmed
in
59,
it
was
then
--
he
reinstituted
it
based
on
douglas
in
64,
came
up
here
and
was
remanded
in
light
of
chapman.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
to
the
district
court
of
appeal.
there
the
petitioner
--
petition
for
hearing,
he
was
denied.
he
then
petitioned
for
a
certiorari
in
this
court
and
this
court
denied
the
petition
for
certiorari.
now,
that
is
--
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
oh
yes,
your
honor.
it's
clear
that
the
--
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
alright,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
well,
your
honor,
i
think
i
can
forward
to
this
court
in
case
in
which
the
supreme
court
did
review
it.
the
only
thing
i
don't
know
about
that
particular
case
is
whether
or
not
it
was
done
pursuant
to
a
remand
from
this
case.
but
it
did
involve
a
chapman
type
issue
and
a
hearing
was
granted
on
it.
as
to
the
question
of
the
california
supreme
court's
being
able
to
review
the
--
this
judgment.
i
think
there's
no
question
about
it
based
on
the
constitution
and
laws
that
set
forth
in
out
brief.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
mr.
chief
justice,
just
in
connect
with
1253.
i
would
call
that
to
the
court's
attention
for
the
simple
reason
that
it
says
may
be
affirmed,
if
the
appellate
fails
to
appear
but
can
be
reversed
only
after
argument,
though,
the
respondent
fails
to
appear.
in
other
words,
that
is
the
situation
wherein
the
respondent
state
in
the
criminal
case
have
a
--
may
argue
the
case
but
there
isn't
the
equivalent
situation
with
regard
to
the
appellant
and
the
1253
therefore
does
not
govern
in
this
situation.
mr.
edward
p.
o'brien
thank
you.
