justice
potter
stewart
but
when
this
--
certainly
the
court
of
appeal
for
the
first
appellate
district
of
your
state,
when
the
case
was
before
for
the
third
time
not
the
second
time,--
justice
potter
stewart
--
this
is
what
justice
fortas
read,
but
for
the
third
time,
after
it
has
been
remanded
in
the
light
of
chapman.
justice
potter
stewart
first,
it
was
really
granted
as
i
understand
it
the
light
of
griffin.
then
it
was
remanded
in
the
light
of
chapman
and
this
brief
opinion
appears
on
341
or
342
of
the
appendix
indicates
that
the
court
at
least
purported
to
be
applying
the
rule
annunciated
in
chapman,
isn't
it?
we
declare
belief
that
such
error
was
harmless
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt.
that's
exactly
what
you
said
the
standard
ought
to
be
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
and
was
said
to
be
in
the
chapman
case?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's
some
–
that's
a
depth
question
but
i'm
talking
about
the
standard
that
they
verbalized.
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
further
say
that
whenever
you
have
comment
on
his
failure
to
testify,
there
is
such
a
basis?
justice
potter
stewart
exactly.
justice
potter
stewart
but
that
i
thought
was
my
point
of
view
in
the
chapman
case
and
i
would
hold
by
myself,
you
know?
justice
potter
stewart
but
we
have
to
overrule
the
chapman
case?
justice
potter
stewart
where
was
the
--
you're
not
suggesting
are
you
any
deliberate
wrong
doing
of
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
certainly
and
the
conviction
was
affirmed
and
we
--
it
was
remanded
by
us
only
for
reconsideration
in
the
light
of
griffin
which
involve
comment
on
his
failure
to
testify.
it
didn't
involve
anything
else?
justice
potter
stewart
what
joint?
justice
potter
stewart
when
it
was
remanded
in
the
light
of
griffin,
it
was
simply
remanded
in
the
light
of
case
that
it
said
that
you
can't
comment
on
the
defendant's
failure
to
testify
and
it
was
limited
remand
but
however,
that's
--
that's
--
i
just
want
to
make
clear
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
what
you
were
charging
--
justice
potter
stewart
how
about
the
--
there
were
three
robberies?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
and
there
were
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
court
was
the
first
appellate
district?
justice
potter
stewart
second
division
that
is
what
area
of
the
state?
justice
potter
stewart
and
if
this
--
this
trial
was
in
san
francisco,
in
the
city?
justice
potter
stewart
across
the
bay.
and
the
judges
were
judges
shoemaker,
aggie,
and
taylor?
justice
potter
stewart
and
is
that
division
ii
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
does
that
consist
of
only
three
judges?
justice
potter
stewart
so,
unless
there
was
a
change
in
personnel,
made
entirely
personnel
--
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
--
is
that
in
the
appendix?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
klitgaard.
justice
potter
stewart
would
for
just
a
moment.
get
back
to
this
threshold
question
we
seem
to
have
in
this
case.
justice
brennan
asked
your
brother
counsel
about
the
statement
in
your
reply
brief
saying
it
was
doubtful
that
state's
supreme
court
could
have
granted
review
even
had
it
want
it
too
in
citing
those
--
citing
two
cases.
do
those
cases
really
standard
for
it?
justice
potter
stewart
of
course
in
this
case,
we
set
aside
a
judgment
twice
but
we're
talking
about
the
final
the
last
time.
justice
potter
stewart
and
they
set
aside
a
judgment
remanded
it
to
the
court
so
that
it
started
everything
doing
again

doesn't
