mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
criminal
case
from
california.
it
involves
the
application
of
the
harmless
error
rule
to
comment
and
instruction
on
petitioner's
failure
to
testify
of
trial.
the
crimes
involved
were
robbery
and
attempted
robbery.
the
only
issue
was
one
of
identification.
mixed
in,
in
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
was
a
show
up,
a
line
up
and
a
showing
of
photographs
by
the
prosecution
to
witnesses
before
trial.
also
involved
was
the
use
of
petitioner's
silence
against
him
in
another
way
that
is
to
the
use
of
adoptive
admissions
to
the
use
of
petitioner's
silence
in
the
place
of
accusations.
at
trial
procedurally,
petitioner
was
without
counsel
and
defended
himself
in
pro
per.
on
appeal,
there
was
a
partial
denial
of
counsel
as
we
will
see.
the
case
begun
in
1962,
petitioner
was
convicted
in
the
alameda
county
superior
court
of
two
counts
of
robbery
and
one
count
of
attempted
robbery.
he
appealed
counsel
was
appointed.
counsel
briefed
and
argued
the
case.
the
district
court
of
appeal
affirmed
the
conviction.
counsel,
the
next
day,
after
the
affirmance
wrote
petition
letters
saying
he
was
withdrawing
from
the
case.
it
was
no
evidence
anywhere
that
counsel
sent
a
letter
of
that
--
a
copy
of
that
letter
to
the
court
of
appeals.
petitioner
then
went
ahead
and
filed
the
pro
per
petition
for
hearing
in
a
california
supreme
court.
the
court
denied
the
hearing
and
petitioner
then
came
here.
he
filed
the
pro
per
petition
for
cert
and
in
1966,
the
court
granted
the
petition.
and
in
a
per
curiam
remanded
the
case
to
the
district
court
of
appeal
for
further
consideration
in
light
of
griffin
against
california.
alright
the
court,
the
case
gets
back
down
to
the
court
of
appeal.
petitioner
writes
the
court
and
asks
for
counsel,
someone
to
brief
and
argue
his
case.
the
court
denies
petitioner
counsel,
it
says,
he's
still
represented
by
the
original
attorney
and
if
he
wants
to
file
a
brief,
better
get
one
in
promptly.
petitioner
eventually
filed
the
brief
in
pro
per.
the
state
attorney
general
sent
a
paragraph
or
a
page
and
a
half
letter
to
the
court
saying
that,
the
evidence
was
overwhelming
against
petitioner
and
besides
petitioner
and
his
pro
per
petition
had
not
made
any
factual
showing
to
show
a
miscarriage
of
justice.
the
court
without
oral
argument
about
two
weeks
after
receiving
the
state's
letter
entered
--
filed
an
opinion
that
incorporated
its
first
opinion
by
reference.
referred
briefly
to
the
evidence
and
then
said
that
in
view
of
the
overwhelming
evidence
of
petitioner's
guilt.
it
was
not
reasonably
probable
a
different
result
would
have
been
obtained
absent
to
comment
on
his
failure
to
testify.
petitioner
again
in
pro
per
filed
the
petition
for
certiorari
in
this
court.
the
court
again
granted
the
writ.
this
time
it
remanded
the
case
to
the
court
of
appeal
with
instructions
to
reconsider
the
case
in
light
of
chapman,
the
harmless
error
rule.
again,
petitioner
requested
the
court
appoint
counsel
for
him.
he
did
this
twice
and
again
the
court
refused.
petitioner
eventually
filed
the
brief
in
pro
per
in
the
court
of
appeals.
the
state
didn't
file
a
brief.
it
just
sent
in
a
two-paragraph
letter
saying
that
it
incorporated
by
reference,
everything
that
it
said
before
and
it
did
have
anything
further
to
add.
without
hearing
argument,
without
hearing
anything
from
counsel
for
petitioner,
he
never
filed
anything
on
any
of
the
remands.
the
court
of
appeals,
the
second
time
around,
entered
a
two-page
opinion
said
it,
it
considered
the
case
a
couple
of
times
before,
it
incorporated
its
first
opinion
by
reference
and
then
went
on
to
say
just
in
the
sentence.
after
further
consideration,
we
declare
a
belief
based
upon
the
conclusive
evidence
of
guilt
that
the
comment
an
error
and
the
comment
on
the
failure
to
testify
was
harmless
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
after
that
petitioner
again
came
here,
he
filed
a
petition
in
pro
per,
again
asking
the
court
for
a
hearing.
the
court
granted
the
petition
last
october,
appointed
counsel
and
set
the
case
down
for
argument.
in
january,
this
court
denied
a
motion
by
the
state
to
dispense
with
printing
the
record.
now,
the
state
contends
that
the
--
at
this
point
that
on
the
totally
of
the
record,
the
comment
and
instruction
on
petitioner's
failure
to
testify
were
harmless
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt.
it
also
raises
two
issues
never
raise
before
in
the
court
of
appeals
or
it
--
or
before
on
this
court
--
in
this
court,
eventhough,
it
answer
each
petition
for
certiorari.
first,
it
says
that
petitioner
waived
his
fifth
amendment
rights
by
the
manner
in
which
he
depend
himself
in
pro
per
during
the
trial.
during
trial,
petitioner
in
cross-examining
asks
a
couple
of
questions
that
were
less
and
articulate
and
it
looks
like
he
might
have
been
testifying.
the
court
corrected
him.
he
got
back
on
the
track
and
continued
on.
at
the
end
of
trial
during
oral
argument
after
the
prosecutor
had
already
commented
on
his
failure
to
testify
and
rack
them
up
on
that
as
his
final
clinching
point.
petitioner
came
back
and
made
a
few
statements
that
a
lawyer
would
make
he
said,
he
was
innocent.
the
court
corrected
him
said,
he
can't
say
that.
petitioner
said,
alright
judge
and
then,
he
followed
the
court's
instruction
and
went
on,
and
made
his
argument
to
the
jury
as
best
he
could.
now,
the
state
claims
that's
a
waiver.
he
waived
his
fifth
amendment
rights.
i
think
the
evidence
will
show
as
we
go
along
that
there
was
no
such
waiver.
neither
the
trial
court
and
the
prosecutor
or
any
of
the
lower
courts
reviewed
this
case.
everyone
suggested
there
was
a
waiver
and
not
once
during
argument
to
the
jury
or
at
anytime
during
trial
did
the
judge
ever
tell
petitioner
that
he
was
in
danger
of
waiving
his
fifth
amendment
rights.
the
other
issue
is
a
jurisdictional
point
is
raise
for
the
first
time.
the
state
now
says,
the
court
can't
hear
the
case.
it
made
a
mistake.
the
state
says
that,
the
court
should
not
have
remanded
the
second
time
for
further
consideration
in
light
of
chapman
and
it
shouldn't
have
granted
cert
this
last
time.
the
reason
as
according
to
the
state
is
that
because
after
each
remand,
petitioner
didn't
come
back
and
file
a
petition
for
discretionary
review
in
the
california
supreme
court.
as
to
that
point,
suffice
to
say
that
at
the
very
outset
of
these
whole
proceeding,
petitioner
in
pro
per
went
to
the
california
supreme
court.
he
was
denied
a
hearing
under
california
law
that
judgment
then
became
final.
after
that,
this
case
was
bouncing
back
and
forth
between
this
court
and
the
court
of
appeals.
what
petitioner
was
seeking
when
he
came
back
here
each
time
was
enforcement
of
this
court's
mandate,
enforcement
of
the
directions
of
this
court
to
give
him
a
hearing,
the
court
below
and
for
that
it
was
proper
that
he
come
back
here
to
the
court
that
issue
the
mandate
rather
than
to
a
stranger
court.
now,
the
state
--
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
he
said
for
further
consideration
proceedings
in
light
of
griffin
against
california
--
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
that's
--
that's
one
--
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
yes,
mr.
justice.
what
i'm
saying
is
the
petition
is
never
had
a
hearing
on
his
griffin
comment
and
when
i
went
to
the
record
that
thing
turned
out
to
be
a
veritable
can
of
worms.
it
was
used
by
adopted
admissions
against
petitioner
and
this
consisted
at
trial
now
that
prosecution
adduced
evidence
at
the
time
of
petitioner's
arrest.
the
police
officer
said,
“there
been
some
robberies
and
buddy
you
fit
the
description.”
and
petitioner
remained
silent,
he
didn't
do
anything.
at
trial
--
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
the
point
--
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
correct,
your
honor.
and
in
properly
appointing
the
harmless
error
standard,
we
look
at
the
totality
of
the
evidence
introduced
against
petitioner
at
this
trial
and
for
that
reason
we
get
into
how
the
comment,
get
into
the
overall
--
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
no,
i
don't.
i
--
and
i'm
--
i
hope
i
have
it.
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
yes,
sir.
the
standard
--
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
i
think
the
correct
standard
is
the
one
this
court
announced
in
chapman
that
the
court
must
be
able
to
declare
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt
that
the
area
was
harmless.
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
that
means
that
the
court
has
to
look
at
the
evidence.
it
has
to
look
at
it,
the
record.
it
has
to
look
at
the
overall
context
of
the
trial.
it
has
to
be
able
to
say
that
this
comment
did
not
contribute
to
the
conviction
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt
and
as
to
that
the
burden
is
on
the
state.
mr.
justice,
after
going
through
this
record
and
it
seems
to
me
that
how
can
you
ever
say
comment
on
failure
to
testify
is
harmless.
that
goes
to
the
basic
issue
in
the
whole
case,
guilt
or
innocence.
and
no
appellate
court
can
see
the
impact
on
the
jury
when
that
comment
is
made.
it
can't
--
it
can't
see
the
widening
of
the
jury's
eyes.
now,
i
know
you
ruled
already
against
this
point
that
you
can
apply
the
harmless
error
rule
in
the
comment
cases.
but
what
i'm
saying
right
now
is
that
when
you
get
into
the
harmless
error
on
comment
and
failure
to
testify,
you
have
to
start
in
and
reweigh
the
whole
case.
you
have
to
look
at
the
facts,
look
at
how
they
split
in.
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
it
--
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
mr.
justice,
what
the
court
of
appeal
did
was
repeat
the
language
in
the
chapman
test
but
how
could
the
court
of
appeal
decide
this
case
without
hearing
a
lawyer
argue
the
facts.
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
should
the
standard
verbalize
this
--
the
one
that
this
court
is
conducting.
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
i
don't
believe
that.
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
that's
right.
that
--
that
was
how
they
--
that's
their
phrasing
here
based
upon
conclusive
evidence.
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
i
would
hope
not.
i
would
mean
it
--
i
would
think
the
chapman
means
that
you
have
to
look
at
--
you
don't
just
look
at
--
you're
not
just
weighing
the
number
of
balls
in
a
cannon
in
one
side
and
the
balls
--
number
of
balls
on
the
cannon
the
other
side.
you
look
--
chapman
means
that
you
look
all
the
evidence,
not
just
the
evidence
that
point
towards
this
one
result.
now,
it
is
a
fact
the
jury
convicted
the
man
is
--
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
that's
--
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
i
think
you're
agreeing
with
me,
mr.
justice,
you
have
to
look
at
all
the
evidence.
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
that's
would
it
--
that's
would
it
--
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
--
appear
to
you.
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
no,
sir.
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
no.
the
way
i
think
and
i
verbalize
the
test
is
the
test
has
to
be
applied
upon
the
basis
of
all
the
evidence
in
the
record
and
if
there
is
slightest
--
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
--
if
there
is
a
slightest
doubt
that
this
comment
might
have
convinced
one
juror,
one
juror
to
be
the
evidence
against
the
defendant
and
that
--
when
you
can't
show
that
that
error
was
harmless.
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
that's
right.
let
me
put
to
you
this
--
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
but
why
is
the
prosecutor
making
the
comment?
he's
not
up
there
just
beating
his.
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
that's
right.
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
well,
i
--
you
got
somebody
with
you
standing
over
here.
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
i
don't
think
you
have
to
overrule
chapman
to
get
it
--
to
get
the
reversal
in
this
case
because
in
this
case
there
is
all
kinds
of
doubt
the
petitioner
was
the
robber.
in
fact,
they
had
three
robberies
at
night.
you
had
two
chinese
men
coming
in
testifying.
they're
all
excited.
one
of
them
said,
he
went
for
the
line
up
and
he
couldn't
identify
the
petitioner.
he
said
that
two
weeks
before
trial.
the
prosecutor
brought
around
a
photograph
but
the
police
brought
around
a
photograph,
a
mugshot,
and
say,
is
this
man
the
man
who
held
up
your
store?
and
the
witness
looked
at
the
photograph.
on
the
back
of
it
was
the
description
of
the
defendant,
age,
height,
size,
weight,
name.
on
the
front
was
the
numbers
across
the
chest.
the
photograph
showed
the
man
like
it
appeared
in
court
without
his
hat.
two
weeks
before
trial,
a
district
attorney
gets
a
hold
of
the
two
guys
who
are
least
certain
of
identification
at
the
line
up.
he
calls
them
into
his
office
and
says,
“i
want
you
take
a
look
at
the
picture
here.”
“picture
of
whom?”
“picture
of
the
defendant
we're
going
to
try.
and
while
we're
at,
let's
take
a
look
at
his
clothes.”
clothes
in
his
run
that
we
took
from
the
night
of
the
crime,
then
the
witnesses
come
into
court
and
they
say,
“sure,
we
identify
the
defendant.”
and
all
these
came
out
at
trial.
i
mean
any
right
thinking
juror
will
have
a
little
bit
of
doubt
about
the
validity
of
this
eyewitness
evidence
where
the
police
bring
in
photographs
and
shown
to
the
witnesses
just
before
trial.
i
mean,
crying
out
loud.
why
were
they
doing
it?
it
wasn't
just
for
the
fun
of
it.
now,
the
--
and
again,
to
show
you
what
kind
of
evidence
the
state
was
using
against
petitioner
which
would
cast
a
doubt
that
on
the
fact
that
he
was
a
robber.
to
have
this
man
who
says,
he
has
identified
he
could
have
recognized
the
robber
again
if
he
saw
him
in
the
next
100
years.
never
forget
his
face,
(inaudible).
this
man
comes
in
and
tells
that
--
tells
the
jury
that
he
didn't
remember
whether
the
robber
had
any
grease
on
his
face
for
example.
then
he
tells
the
jury,
didn't
remember
whether
the
robber
had
any
lip
glisters.
petitioner
had
a
decorative
lip
glisters
under
his
lip.
the
man
who
says
he
recognize
petitioner
a
hundred
years,
also
tells
the
jury
that
he
was
hot
when
he
went
to
the
line
up.
he
was
mad.
he
didn't
want
to
go
to
the
line
up.
he
had
work
to
do.
the
police
told
him
to
come
down
and
see
if
he
can
pick
out
the
suspect.
he
got
him
down
here.
you
got
all
these
witnesses
who
are
all
over
the
place
and
there
testimony.
and
if
you
look
in
the
brief,
you'll
see
they
describe
a
man
of
all
different
colors
and
sizes.
the
most
important
thing,
mr.
justice
stewart,
this
will
show
you
where
the
real
bite
of
this
promissory
rule
comes
in.
here,
the
district
attorney
when
the
case
was
on
remand
took
the
clothing
out
of
the
files
of
the
superior
court
and
the
destroyed
the
clothing
that
was
used
in
evidence
against
petitioner.
so,
there's
no
way
that
an
appellate
court
could
ever
look
at
that
clothing
and
see
if
it
were
being
properly
described
during
trial.
he
also
took
the
diagram
that
was
used
against
petitioner
trial.
what
happened
was
that
the
district
attorney
had
someone
come
in
from
his
office
and
make
a
rough
sketch
not
one
to
scale
and
says,
“well,
this
is
the
locations
of
the
various
robberies
and
so
forth.”
and
then,
when
this
court
remands
the
first
time,
not
the
second
time,
when
it
remand
the
first
time
for
considerations
under
griffin.
the
da
goes
into
the
files
takes
that
evidence
out,
takes
that
diagram
out
and
destroys
it.
he
also
destroyed
most
of
the
other
exhibits
and
it
was
only
by
good
fortune
that
petitioner
had
copies
and
we're
able
to
get
some
of
it
to
show
what
was
in
the
record.
they
denied
they
have
the
exhibits.
they
have
to
go
up
there
and
fight
to
get
the
exhibits.
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
no.
i'm
suggesting
the
case
dragged
on.
the
judgment
became
final
in
the
court
of
appeal.
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
no.
there
--
they're
nice
guys.
i
mean
they're
trying
to
do
their
job.
i'm
sure
when
they
--
if
it's
ever
thought
that
they're
violating
this
court's
mandate
they
wouldn't
have
done
it.
but
the
fact
remain
is
--
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
--
the
evidence
isn't
there?
then
when
--
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
oh,
no.
no.
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
no.
in
fact,
no.
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
yes,
i
am.
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
that
is
the
exact
advice
in
this
standard.
i
think
when
you
try
a
case
you
can
just
see
the
jury
sometimes
that
they
--
their
eyes
widen
at
certain
evidence,
where
was
the
missing
witness.
you
can
always
see
the
jury's
eyes
widen
at
that
and
that's
the
frustrating
part
about
the
harmless
error
rule.
you
just
can't
measure
the
impact
on
the
jury
when
come
up
on
appeal.
you
can
kill
by
a
single
bullet.
that
comment
at
the
end
of
trial
as
in
this
case
at
the
very
end
of
the
prosecutor's
argument
when
he
was
winding
up.
the
point
he
used
against
petitioners.
he
hadn't
got
up
on
the
stand
and
testified.
then
petitioner
got
up
in
his
argument
and
he
said,
“you've
tried
to
go
through
the
facts
and
went
through
about
showing
a
photographs
and
so
forth.”
and
said,
he
hadn't
testified
because
he
didn't
think
the
government
had
proved
its
case
and
so
on.”
the
prosecutor
got
right
back
up
after
that
and
said
to
the
jury,
“look
here
he
said,
you
can't
expect
all
the
witnesses
to
agree
in
what
they
saw
and
besides
the
line
up
showed
to
you
is
guilty.”
pick
him
out
right
there
these
people
and
beside
that
there's
lot
of
circumstantial
evidence
in
this
case,
lots
of
it.
let's
look
at
the
circumstantial
evidence.
the
prosecutor
said,
“this
is
the
whole
last
part
of
his
argument
to
the
jury,
closing
argument.”
he
said,
“petitioner
here
was
cool
--
cool,
you
saw
him
in
court.
how
cool
he
was
defending
himself.”
well,
the
robber
was
described
as
cool.
you
saw
that
--
heard
the
evidence
that
there
was
some
crumpled
money
in
petitioner's
pockets,
that's
circumstantial
evidence.”
other
circumstantial
evidence
is
that
when
petitioner
was
accused
of
being
the
robber
by
the
policeman
at
the
time
of
the
arrest
and
one
of
the
witnesses
said
to
him
in
the
line
up
quarter,
“that's
the
man”,
when
petitioner
remains
silent
there.
that's
evidence,
that's
circumstantial
evidence
of
guilt
and
you
can
take
into
consideration
of
fact
that
petitioner
didn't
testify.
and
the
courts
going
to
tell
you
and
i'm
telling
you
now
that
you
--
if
he
could
have
denied
it,
you'll
be
instructed
that
that
you
can
infer
that
he
wasn't
able
to
deny
it
and
you
can
take
his
failure
to
testify
in
consideration.
now,
petitioner's
defense
basically
was
--
it
was
former.
he
earned
his
money.
he's
been
working
in
pittsburgh,
a
little
town
outside
of
concord,
outside
of
oakland
and
if
prosecutor
got
up
and
he
said,
well,
we
know
that
as
his
last
punch
of
petitioner
after
this
other
failure
to
testify
business.
he
got
up
and
said,
well,
you
know
petitioner
says
he
earned
his
money
and
so
forth.
but
we
all
know
lots
of
people
have
bills
and
things
like
that
and
we
don't
know
that
the
money
of
the
petitioner
had
in
his
pocket
was
the
same
money
he
earned
because
he
hasn't
got
to
understand
and
told
you.”
and
then
he
says
petitioner
asked
why
people
rob?
he
said,
you
can
ask
lots
of
people
why
people
rob.
lots
of
persons
you
could
ask
that
question
too.
and
then
he
says
to
the
jury
at
the
very
end
winding
up,
you
can
take
in
consideration
not
just
the
direct
evidence
but
look
at
all
these
circumstantial
evidence,
who
have
just
been
talking
about.
you
can
reach
your
verdict
on
that
and
then
the
court
went
on
to
instruct
on
this
accusations
that
that
was
something
jury
could
consider
in
his
admission
of
guilt,
instructed
on
a
failure
to
testify.
the
state
makes
a
big
deal
out
of
petitioner
coping
somewhere
from
the
california
standard
instruction
book
in
the
long
hand,
an
instruction
on
the
failure
to
testify
and
giving
it
to
the
judge.
the
judge
had
already
told
petitioner
he's
going
to
give
the
instruction.
the
judge
didn't
give
the
instruction,
petitioner
tried
to
write
out
to
give
a
far
more
damning
one.
they
told
the
jury
that
if
petitioner
was
in
the
position
to
understand
all
these
and
know
the
facts
and
then
deny
him.
then
the
jury
could
take
that
into
consideration.
there
is
one
point,
the
other
point
i
want
to
test
--
bring
up
not
testify
to
and
that's
the
denial
of
counsel
of
trial.
now,
petitioner
had
been
represented
by
the
public
defender
at
the
preliminary
hearing
and
at
the
arraignment.
and
as
you
can
see
from
the
bringing
of
briefs
there
are
three
crimes
it
was
important
that
if
he
could
as
a
tactical
matter.
the
petitioner
would
be
tried
separately
on
each
of
those
crimes
because
any
avoid
that
overlap
and
the
modus
operandi
argument
that
the
like
the
prosecutor
made.
so,
petitioner
goes
to
your
--
to
the
arraignment
and
that
public
defender
tells
the
judge,
he
wants
to
make
a
motion
for
separate
trials.
alright,
but
then
instead
of
arguing
the
motion,
he
tells
the
judge,
we'll
take
it
under
submission.
next
week
or
so,
they
come
back
to
court
for
a
hearing
and
the
judge
turns
to
the
public
--
to
the
prosecutor
and
says,
what
do
you
have
to
say
about
this
motion
for
separate
trials
that
prosecutor,
the
da
makes
his
speech.
then
petitioner,
his
lawyer
gets
up
and
says,
“well,
the
pleadings
are
defective.”
that's
about
it
and
the
court
overrules
the
motion
for
separate
trials.
petitioner
then
the
next
time
they
go
to
court,
petitioner
asked
that
public
defender
if
he
can
ask
the
court
a
question
you
--
it
says
the
judge,
"so
your
honor,
i
don't
think
its
constitutional,
if
the
(inaudible)
at
the
same
time
for
these
crimes
and
instead
of
defending
the
standing
up
for
his
client.
the
public
defender
says
the
judge,
“well
your
honor,
you
said
the
--
this
is
the
same
thing
i
raised
before
a
couple
of
weeks
ago
and
you
already
ruled
against
petitioner
on
it.
he's
just
raising
the
same
point
now
on
put
on
a
different
constitutional
ground.”
and
then
the
defendant
says,
“i
think
it's
reasonable
but
so
forth,
and
the
judges
out
hearing
from
the
da
simply
goes
ahead
and
denies
the
motion.”
two
weeks
later
petitioner
comes
back
before
the
judge
for
a
hearing
to
set
a
trial
date.
he
says
to
the
judge
butts
in,
it
says,
your
honor,
can
you
take
care
of
this
constitutional
thing
for
me.
and
that
--
and
on
similar
facts
and
the
public
defendant
says,
“i
don't
know
his
talking
about
now”
to
the
judge.
he
says,
“you've
already
ruled
on
the
motion
for
separate
trials.”
and
then
the
judge
denied,
the
judge
law
is
talking
about
separate
trial
in
each
of
the
three
counts
and
the
motion
is
denied.
and
then
petitioner
said,
“i
don't
want
to
be
represented
anymore
by
the
public
defender.”
the
court
looks
at
the
charges
so
you
can't
put
a
serious
crimes
can't
waive
it,
can't
waive
a
defense.
but
the
petitioner
says,
i
don't
want
to
be
represented
by
this
man
anymore.
it
doesn't
look
to
me
like
public
defender's
office
is
any
match
for
the
da
around
here
not
qualified.
that
will
and
the
judge
says,
alright,
you
can
go
to
trial
by
yourself
but
we'll
have
someone
from
the
public
defender's
office
sit
inside
the
courtroom
with
you
behind
there
and
will
help
you
out.
and
just
then
the
public
defender
apply
his
evidence
says,
“wait
a
minute,
your
honor.
can
i
be
heard?
looks
this
guy
looks
like
a
wise
guy.
he's
trying
to
pull
something
off
and
his
trying
to
look
like
a
poor
little
man
infront
of
the
public,
infront
of
the
da
being
picked
upon.”
if
one
of
his
legal
points
bounces
on
him,
it's
going
to
be
real
tough.
he
says,
“i
don't
want
any
part
of
this
mixed
merit.
either
we
go
--
either
he
goes
along
or
he
goes
with
us.”
and
the
court
then
said
to
the
public
defender,
listen,
you
have
someone
here
in
court.
so
the
next
day
--
about
two
weeks
later,
petitioner
comes
up
for
trial
before
a
different
judge.
this
judge
hears
about
petitioner
wanting
counsel
and
he
requires
in
the
petitioners
background.
he
finds
out
that
he's
got
a
record,
a
young
man
in
illinois
have
been
convicted
for
murder.
he's
been
out
for
parole
in
california.
working
as
a
plumber
up
in
pittsburgh,
sixth
grade
education,
mentally
defective,
he's
been
in
the
hospital
for
mental
treatment
and
emotionally
upset
about
the
charges.
the
judge
says,
“look!”
he
says,
“you
can't
defend
yourself.
this
is
--
no
man
should
defend
himself
in
felony
charge.”
and
petitioner
says,
“i'm
not
going
to
stick
with
this
public
defender.
i
want
someone
that
qualified,
someone
i
have
confidence.”
the
judge
says,
“well,
take
the
public
defender
or
nobody.”
meanwhile,
while
all
of
these
are
going
on
of
course.
there's
an
assistant
public
defender
listening
to
it,
happens
at
trial
what
was
being
said.
the
case
comes
back,
the
judge
says,
“well
alright,
you
have
to
go
by
yourself.
i
can't
give
any
help.
then
petitioner
in
the
real
flash
of
brilliance
says
the
judge,
“well,
i
look
better
on
appeal
if
i
go
up
without
counsel.”
and
the
judge
jump
up
and
said,
“what
do
you
mean
by
that?”
petitioner
said,
“what
i
mean
is,
i
think
i
still
have
a
right
to
counsel
that
points
some
other
than
the
public
defender.
so,
he
goes
before
the
next
judge.
he
disqualifies
the
judge,
he
asked
for
change
of
venue
to
go
back
before
the
first
guy.
he
gets
back
before
the
first
judge,
the
one
who
heard
the
public
defender
call
him
a
wise
guy.
petitioner
and
this
judge
says,
“well,
you
can
still
have
the
public
defender.”
petitioner
says,
“i
don't
want
the
public
defender.
just
appoint
anybody
from
the
open
bar,
just
anybody,
other
than
a
public
defender.
somebody
i
can
believe
in.”
the
judge
says,
“go
to
trial
as
a
public
defender
without
anybody.”
and
then
he
says,
“well.”
then
petitioner
says,
“well,
how
about
this
guy
who's
been
sitting
here,
the
assistant
public
defender.”
the
assistant
public
defender
was
present
during
the
second
proceeding
when
all
this
come
out
of
our
petitioner's
background
and
so
forth.
he
didn't
say
a
word
to
the
judge
about
that.
he
just
kept
his
mouth
shut.
so
the
third
judge,
i
mean
with
the
first
judge,
who
heard
petitioner
call
the
wise
guy
was
it
--
finally
the
judge
who
tried
this
case
but
the
public
defender
who
was
in
between
him,
both
didn't
report
back
to
this
--
to
the
trial
judge
the
way
heard
at
the
prior
proceeding.
the
petitioner
had
a
sixth
grade
education
and
he
was
all
--
he
was
a
plumber
and
so
forth,
and
so
petitioner
goes
to
trial.
and
the
first
thing
the
da
--
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
well,
if
you
read
--
if
you
see
what
the
judge
said
during
board
there
mr.
justice.
petitioner
is
conducting
his
word
at
the
jury
see,
here
he
is
all
alone.
the
judge
he
says
to
the
jury,
he's
trying
to
explain
what
separate
defenses
are.
if
the
jury
can
keep
it
straight
and
if
one
of
the
jury
says,
“i
don't
understand
the
question.”
the
judge
says
the
juror,
“well,
you
can
come
over
here
and
join
me.”
and
then
another
time
during
the
board
hearing
the
judge
--
petitioner
is
asking
the
jury
about
juvenile
delinquency
and
i'll
shut
up
right
after
this.
but
he
asked
the
judge
about
--
he's
asking
about
juvenile
delinquency
and
the
judge
says
to
the
petitioner,
“you
look
a
little
bit
old
to
be
talking
about
juvenile
delinquency,
ha
-
ha
-
ha.”
and
there's
petitioner
taking
it
on
the
chin.
thank
you.
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
i
wish
to,
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
black,
mr.
justice
black,
you
asked
about
the
evidence
at
trial
pointing
to
the
petitioner.
there
was
lots
of
doubt
the
petitioner
was
robber.
in
petitioner's
pocket,
the
police
found
a
$176.00
within
half
an
hour.
the
robber
had
obtained
the
$235.00
to
$265.00
in
cash.
furthermore,
the
last
robbery,
the
one
involving
polititch
and
that
had
some
20's,
twenty
dollar
bills.
when
the
police
search
petitioner,
they
didn't
find
any
twenty
dollar
bills
on
him.
he
didn't
have
any.
at
the
last
liquor
store
where
petitioner
was
arrested.
there
was
absolutely
no
attempt
to
rob
that
liquor
store.
the
clerk
on
duty
testified
during
trial
that
there
was
no
attempt
at
all,
and
made
it
to
rob
the
liquor
store.
the
petitioner
had
not
done
anything
except
make
that
comment.
there
was
one
witness
who
saw
the
robber
come
out
of
the
last
liquor
store
and
he
saw
the
robber
come
out
the
store,
and
go
down
the
street.
he
walked
out
after
the
robber
and
followed
him,
saw
him
get
into
a
car
and
drive
away.
that
man
was
called
to
testify
at
trial.
he
could
not
identify
the
robber.
he
did
not
identify
the
petitioner
as
the
robber.
he
couldn't
identify
anyone.
significantly,
that
one
witness
was
the
only
one
of
all
the
states
witnesses
that
wasn't
shown
a
photograph
of
petitioner
before
trial
and
it
didn't
take
part
in
the
suggestive
line
up
outlined
in
our
brief
or
in
the
show
up.
he
was
the
only
one
who
hadn't
been
exposed
to
petitioner
before
hand.
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
yes,
sir.
i'm
glad
you
ask
the
question
because
here's
what
they
stand
for
and
these
are
cases
in
the
california
district
court
of
appeal
where
after
its
judgment
became
final,
the
90
days
passed.
the
court
of
appeals
modified
its
opinion
like
the
court
did
here.
it
didn't
modify
the
judgment.
the
judgment
still
stayed
the
same
but
it
modified
the
opinion
in
it.
and
from
the
modification
of
the
opinion,
there
was
a
petition
of
the
california
supreme
court
for
a
hearing
and
here's
what
the
california
supreme
court
said.
it
said,
a
different
situation
would
be
presented
if
the
modification
by
the
district
court
of
appeals
had
been
solely
with
regard
to
its
opinion
such
a
modification
would
not
have
affected
the
judgment
which
would
in
that
event
had
become
final
and
that
court
on
the
date
specified.
and
the
supreme
court
wouldn't
have
barred
to
grant
review.
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
right.
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
well,
the
judgment
--
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
yes,
your
honor.
but
the
judgment
was
still
basically
the
same
as
it
had
been
in
the
case
to
all
the
time.
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
something
had
to
be
done
to
it,
it
had
to
be
reentered.
under
the
california
rules
of
appeal
mr.
justice,
even
had
the
petitioner
file
the
petition
rule
29
of
the
california
rules
prohibits
a
california
supreme
court
from
reviewing
just
on
factual
questions.
and
under
that
rule,
the
california
supreme
court
will
not
look
behind
the
statement
of
facts
or
the
dealing
with
factual
matters
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
its
opinion.
now,
let's
not
cite
any
of
the
briefs
but
it
is
upstairs
in
one
of
these
west
books,
its
rule
29.
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
as
--
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
--
as
i
thought,
these
cases
here
ended
the
matter
when
the
california
supreme
court
says,
it's
as
long
as
the
judgment
remains
the
same
if
the
opinion
is
modified
that
doesn't
start
the
time
running
again.
but
as
an
additional
ground,
there
are
these
additional
grounds
that
kept
the
court's
own
rules
prohibit
review.
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
well,
you
must
remember
mr.
justice
that
this
time
petitioner
didn't
have
any
lawyer.
if
you're
going
to
say
the
petitioner
already
have
to
go
back
up
and
down,
then
it
becomes
important
to
decide
whether
petitioner
had
a
right
to
help
him
on
that
discretionary
review.
he
have
no
right
to
review
--
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
i'm
not
saying
that.
i'm
saying
the
petitioner
went
to
the
highest
court
of
the
state.
the
court
denied
him
review.
at
that
point,
the
judgment
under
california
law
became
final
by
anybody
standards.
when
the
case
came
back
down
again,
there
was
no
tampering
with
that
judgment.
the
judgment
remained
the
same.
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
it
was
vacated.
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
it
was
reaffirmed.
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
you
vacated
your
older
decision
--
you
vacated
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
no,
he
didn't
vacate
that.
that
remained
in
effect.
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
follow
your
question
mr.
justice.
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
oh,
the
first
time
out?
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
i
believe
it
was
the
judgment,
if
not
let
me
answer
this
way
because
there's
necessary
question
here
in
california.
now,
once
the
california
supreme
court
takes
his
discretionary
review
and
it
can
do
it
on
its
motion
or
on
petition.
once
it
does
that,
the
whole
court
of
appeals
proceeding
becomes
another
nullity
as
though
it
never
existed.
the
opinion
can't
be
cited
for
anything
as
no
authorities
present
or
anything
else.
so
in
that
case,
when
it
goes
up
to
the
california
supreme
court
is
then
reviewing
the
judgment
in
the
trial
court.
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
that
ends
it.
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
correct.
that's
right.
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
that's
right.
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
it's
the
reinstatement
of
the
original
judgment.
i
mean,
it
wasn't
any
change
in
the
judgment.
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
well,
then
mr.
justice,
the
judgment
was
affirmed.
that's
right,
the
judgment
of
the
trial
court.
but
where
was
petitioner
during
this
time
when
the
case
is
back
down
again.
he
was
still
in
jail.
the
judge
in
the
trial
court
was
still
in
effect.
sure
you
that
of
course
--
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
if
i
were
a
lawyer
in
california
advising
petitioner
at
this
time.
i
would
say,
you
did
not
have
to
go
to
the
california
supreme
court
because
of
the
two
cases
i
cited
and
because
of
my
knowledge
of
the
california
rules,
rules
29
which
says
that
the
california
supreme
court
can't
look
into
these
factual
matters.
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
the
whole
harmless
error
rule
mr.
justice
is
one
of
fact.
you're
looking
at
the
overall
--
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
yes,
every
case
involves
that.
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
well,
let
me
just
come
back
to
mr.
justice
marshall's
point.
mr.
justice,
those
two
cases
that
i
cited
in
my
brief
i
think
on
why
the
california
supreme
court
couldn't
do
it
but
want
it
to
point
up
the
whole
heart
of
the
matter.
now,
as
to
the
argument
on
appeal
as
to
whether
there
should
have
been
oral
argument.
the
california
statute
says,
“that
a
california
appellate
court
in
a
criminal
case
cannot
reverse
a
judgment
unless
it's
his
argument,
that
section
1253
of
penal
code.”
now,
counsel
has
informed
me
that
in
douglas
against
california
which
is
the
--
remember
the
right
to
counsel
case
on
appeal.
there
was
a
remand
to
the
dca
for
further
consideration
in
that
case
that
after
the
dca
appointed
counsel.
there's
another
issue
brought
up
about
counsel
at
trial
and
then
the
supreme
court
granted
a
hearing.
california
supreme
court
granted
a
petition
on
that
different
issue
on
light
of
counsel
at
trial.
but
here
you
weren't
having
in
this
case,
different
issues
coming
up,
your
still
having
the
same
rule
issue
each
time.
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
but
while
it
was
merely
your
honor
in
reply
to
justice
white's
question.
there
is
the
douglas
case
is
an
example
where
after
this
court
remanded
it
to
view
in
light
of
this
decision.
the
district
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
case,
petitioner
or
appellant
at
that
point,
petition
the
california
supreme
court
for
a
hearing.
their
number
of
issues
and
they
granted
a
hearing.
it
went
off
in
that
point
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
he
was
entitled
to
separate
counsel
at
trial
but
they
granted
the
hearing
and
reverse
the
case,
to
reply
justice
white's
question.
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
penal
code
section
1253,
mr.
chief
justice.
it
says,
“the
judgment
may
be
affirmed
if
the
appellant
to
failed
to
appear.
but
can
be
reverse
only
after
argument
though
the
respondent
failed
to
appear.
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
that's
right.
well,
you
--
the
question
that
you
were
concerned
about
was
the
oral
argument.
there
are
some
inquiries
about
the
rules
and
i
just
bring
that
up
to
be
--
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
--helpful.
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
yes,
unless
the
court
has
some
additional
questions.
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
thank
you.
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
criminal
case
from
california.
it
involves
the
application
of
the
harmless
error
rule
to
comment
and
instruction
on
petitioner's
failure
to
testify
of
trial.
the
crimes
involved
were
robbery
and
attempted
robbery.
the
only
issue
was
one
of
identification.
mixed
in,
in
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
was
a
show
up,
a
line
up
and
a
showing
of
photographs
by
the
prosecution
to
witnesses
before
trial.
also
involved
was
the
use
of
petitioner's
silence
against
him
in
another
way
that
is
to
the
use
of
adoptive
admissions
to
the
use
of
petitioner's
silence
in
the
place
of
accusations.
at
trial
procedurally,
petitioner
was
without
counsel
and
defended
himself
in
pro
per.
on
appeal,
there
was
a
partial
denial
of
counsel
as
we
will
see.
the
case
begun
in
1962,
petitioner
was
convicted
in
the
alameda
county
superior
court
of
two
counts
of
robbery
and
one
count
of
attempted
robbery.
he
appealed
counsel
was
appointed.
counsel
briefed
and
argued
the
case.
the
district
court
of
appeal
affirmed
the
conviction.
counsel,
the
next
day,
after
the
affirmance
wrote
petition
letters
saying
he
was
withdrawing
from
the
case.
it
was
no
evidence
anywhere
that
counsel
sent
a
letter
of
that
--
a
copy
of
that
letter
to
the
court
of
appeals.
petitioner
then
went
ahead
and
filed
the
pro
per
petition
for
hearing
in
a
california
supreme
court.
the
court
denied
the
hearing
and
petitioner
then
came
here.
he
filed
the
pro
per
petition
for
cert
and
in
1966,
the
court
granted
the
petition.
and
in
a
per
curiam
remanded
the
case
to
the
district
court
of
appeal
for
further
consideration
in
light
of
griffin
against
california.
alright
the
court,
the
case
gets
back
down
to
the
court
of
appeal.
petitioner
writes
the
court
and
asks
for
counsel,
someone
to
brief
and
argue
his
case.
the
court
denies
petitioner
counsel,
it
says,
he's
still
represented
by
the
original
attorney
and
if
he
wants
to
file
a
brief,
better
get
one
in
promptly.
petitioner
eventually
filed
the
brief
in
pro
per.
the
state
attorney
general
sent
a
paragraph
or
a
page
and
a
half
letter
to
the
court
saying
that,
the
evidence
was
overwhelming
against
petitioner
and
besides
petitioner
and
his
pro
per
petition
had
not
made
any
factual
showing
to
show
a
miscarriage
of
justice.
the
court
without
oral
argument
about
two
weeks
after
receiving
the
state's
letter
entered
--
filed
an
opinion
that
incorporated
its
first
opinion
by
reference.
referred
briefly
to
the
evidence
and
then
said
that
in
view
of
the
overwhelming
evidence
of
petitioner's
guilt.
it
was
not
reasonably
probable
a
different
result
would
have
been
obtained
absent
to
comment
on
his
failure
to
testify.
petitioner
again
in
pro
per
filed
the
petition
for
certiorari
in
this
court.
the
court
again
granted
the
writ.
this
time
it
remanded
the
case
to
the
court
of
appeal
with
instructions
to
reconsider
the
case
in
light
of
chapman,
the
harmless
error
rule.
again,
petitioner
requested
the
court
appoint
counsel
for
him.
he
did
this
twice
and
again
the
court
refused.
petitioner
eventually
filed
the
brief
in
pro
per
in
the
court
of
appeals.
the
state
didn't
file
a
brief.
it
just
sent
in
a
two-paragraph
letter
saying
that
it
incorporated
by
reference,
everything
that
it
said
before
and
it
did
have
anything
further
to
add.
without
hearing
argument,
without
hearing
anything
from
counsel
for
petitioner,
he
never
filed
anything
on
any
of
the
remands.
the
court
of
appeals,
the
second
time
around,
entered
a
two-page
opinion
said
it,
it
considered
the
case
a
couple
of
times
before,
it
incorporated
its
first
opinion
by
reference
and
then
went
on
to
say
just
in
the
sentence.
after
further
consideration,
we
declare
a
belief
based
upon
the
conclusive
evidence
of
guilt
that
the
comment
an
error
and
the
comment
on
the
failure
to
testify
was
harmless
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
after
that
petitioner
again
came
here,
he
filed
a
petition
in
pro
per,
again
asking
the
court
for
a
hearing.
the
court
granted
the
petition
last
october,
appointed
counsel
and
set
the
case
down
for
argument.
in
january,
this
court
denied
a
motion
by
the
state
to
dispense
with
printing
the
record.
now,
the
state
contends
that
the
--
at
this
point
that
on
the
totally
of
the
record,
the
comment
and
instruction
on
petitioner's
failure
to
testify
were
harmless
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt.
it
also
raises
two
issues
never
raise
before
in
the
court
of
appeals
or
it
--
or
before
on
this
court
--
in
this
court,
eventhough,
it
answer
each
petition
for
certiorari.
first,
it
says
that
petitioner
waived
his
fifth
amendment
rights
by
the
manner
in
which
he
depend
himself
in
pro
per
during
the
trial.
during
trial,
petitioner
in
cross-examining
asks
a
couple
of
questions
that
were
less
and
articulate
and
it
looks
like
he
might
have
been
testifying.
the
court
corrected
him.
he
got
back
on
the
track
and
continued
on.
at
the
end
of
trial
during
oral
argument
after
the
prosecutor
had
already
commented
on
his
failure
to
testify
and
rack
them
up
on
that
as
his
final
clinching
point.
petitioner
came
back
and
made
a
few
statements
that
a
lawyer
would
make
he
said,
he
was
innocent.
the
court
corrected
him
said,
he
can't
say
that.
petitioner
said,
alright
judge
and
then,
he
followed
the
court's
instruction
and
went
on,
and
made
his
argument
to
the
jury
as
best
he
could.
now,
the
state
claims
that's
a
waiver.
he
waived
his
fifth
amendment
rights.
i
think
the
evidence
will
show
as
we
go
along
that
there
was
no
such
waiver.
neither
the
trial
court
and
the
prosecutor
or
any
of
the
lower
courts
reviewed
this
case.
everyone
suggested
there
was
a
waiver
and
not
once
during
argument
to
the
jury
or
at
anytime
during
trial
did
the
judge
ever
tell
petitioner
that
he
was
in
danger
of
waiving
his
fifth
amendment
rights.
the
other
issue
is
a
jurisdictional
point
is
raise
for
the
first
time.
the
state
now
says,
the
court
can't
hear
the
case.
it
made
a
mistake.
the
state
says
that,
the
court
should
not
have
remanded
the
second
time
for
further
consideration
in
light
of
chapman
and
it
shouldn't
have
granted
cert
this
last
time.
the
reason
as
according
to
the
state
is
that
because
after
each
remand,
petitioner
didn't
come
back
and
file
a
petition
for
discretionary
review
in
the
california
supreme
court.
as
to
that
point,
suffice
to
say
that
at
the
very
outset
of
these
whole
proceeding,
petitioner
in
pro
per
went
to
the
california
supreme
court.
he
was
denied
a
hearing
under
california
law
that
judgment
then
became
final.
after
that,
this
case
was
bouncing
back
and
forth
between
this
court
and
the
court
of
appeals.
what
petitioner
was
seeking
when
he
came
back
here
each
time
was
enforcement
of
this
court's
mandate,
enforcement
of
the
directions
of
this
court
to
give
him
a
hearing,
the
court
below
and
for
that
it
was
proper
that
he
come
back
here
to
the
court
that
issue
the
mandate
rather
than
to
a
stranger
court.
now,
the
state
--
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
he
said
for
further
consideration
proceedings
in
light
of
griffin
against
california
--
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
that's
--
that's
one
--
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
yes,
mr.
justice.
what
i'm
saying
is
the
petition
is
never
had
a
hearing
on
his
griffin
comment
and
when
i
went
to
the
record
that
thing
turned
out
to
be
a
veritable
can
of
worms.
it
was
used
by
adopted
admissions
against
petitioner
and
this
consisted
at
trial
now
that
prosecution
adduced
evidence
at
the
time
of
petitioner's
arrest.
the
police
officer
said,
“there
been
some
robberies
and
buddy
you
fit
the
description.”
and
petitioner
remained
silent,
he
didn't
do
anything.
at
trial
--
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
the
point
--
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
correct,
your
honor.
and
in
properly
appointing
the
harmless
error
standard,
we
look
at
the
totality
of
the
evidence
introduced
against
petitioner
at
this
trial
and
for
that
reason
we
get
into
how
the
comment,
get
into
the
overall
--
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
no,
i
don't.
i
--
and
i'm
--
i
hope
i
have
it.
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
yes,
sir.
the
standard
--
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
i
think
the
correct
standard
is
the
one
this
court
announced
in
chapman
that
the
court
must
be
able
to
declare
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt
that
the
area
was
harmless.
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
that
means
that
the
court
has
to
look
at
the
evidence.
it
has
to
look
at
it,
the
record.
it
has
to
look
at
the
overall
context
of
the
trial.
it
has
to
be
able
to
say
that
this
comment
did
not
contribute
to
the
conviction
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt
and
as
to
that
the
burden
is
on
the
state.
mr.
justice,
after
going
through
this
record
and
it
seems
to
me
that
how
can
you
ever
say
comment
on
failure
to
testify
is
harmless.
that
goes
to
the
basic
issue
in
the
whole
case,
guilt
or
innocence.
and
no
appellate
court
can
see
the
impact
on
the
jury
when
that
comment
is
made.
it
can't
--
it
can't
see
the
widening
of
the
jury's
eyes.
now,
i
know
you
ruled
already
against
this
point
that
you
can
apply
the
harmless
error
rule
in
the
comment
cases.
but
what
i'm
saying
right
now
is
that
when
you
get
into
the
harmless
error
on
comment
and
failure
to
testify,
you
have
to
start
in
and
reweigh
the
whole
case.
you
have
to
look
at
the
facts,
look
at
how
they
split
in.
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
it
--
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
mr.
justice,
what
the
court
of
appeal
did
was
repeat
the
language
in
the
chapman
test
but
how
could
the
court
of
appeal
decide
this
case
without
hearing
a
lawyer
argue
the
facts.
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
should
the
standard
verbalize
this
--
the
one
that
this
court
is
conducting.
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
i
don't
believe
that.
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
that's
right.
that
--
that
was
how
they
--
that's
their
phrasing
here
based
upon
conclusive
evidence.
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
i
would
hope
not.
i
would
mean
it
--
i
would
think
the
chapman
means
that
you
have
to
look
at
--
you
don't
just
look
at
--
you're
not
just
weighing
the
number
of
balls
in
a
cannon
in
one
side
and
the
balls
--
number
of
balls
on
the
cannon
the
other
side.
you
look
--
chapman
means
that
you
look
all
the
evidence,
not
just
the
evidence
that
point
towards
this
one
result.
now,
it
is
a
fact
the
jury
convicted
the
man
is
--
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
that's
--
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
i
think
you're
agreeing
with
me,
mr.
justice,
you
have
to
look
at
all
the
evidence.
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
that's
would
it
--
that's
would
it
--
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
--
appear
to
you.
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
no,
sir.
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
no.
the
way
i
think
and
i
verbalize
the
test
is
the
test
has
to
be
applied
upon
the
basis
of
all
the
evidence
in
the
record
and
if
there
is
slightest
--
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
--
if
there
is
a
slightest
doubt
that
this
comment
might
have
convinced
one
juror,
one
juror
to
be
the
evidence
against
the
defendant
and
that
--
when
you
can't
show
that
that
error
was
harmless.
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
that's
right.
let
me
put
to
you
this
--
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
but
why
is
the
prosecutor
making
the
comment?
he's
not
up
there
just
beating
his.
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
that's
right.
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
well,
i
--
you
got
somebody
with
you
standing
over
here.
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
i
don't
think
you
have
to
overrule
chapman
to
get
it
--
to
get
the
reversal
in
this
case
because
in
this
case
there
is
all
kinds
of
doubt
the
petitioner
was
the
robber.
in
fact,
they
had
three
robberies
at
night.
you
had
two
chinese
men
coming
in
testifying.
they're
all
excited.
one
of
them
said,
he
went
for
the
line
up
and
he
couldn't
identify
the
petitioner.
he
said
that
two
weeks
before
trial.
the
prosecutor
brought
around
a
photograph
but
the
police
brought
around
a
photograph,
a
mugshot,
and
say,
is
this
man
the
man
who
held
up
your
store?
and
the
witness
looked
at
the
photograph.
on
the
back
of
it
was
the
description
of
the
defendant,
age,
height,
size,
weight,
name.
on
the
front
was
the
numbers
across
the
chest.
the
photograph
showed
the
man
like
it
appeared
in
court
without
his
hat.
two
weeks
before
trial,
a
district
attorney
gets
a
hold
of
the
two
guys
who
are
least
certain
of
identification
at
the
line
up.
he
calls
them
into
his
office
and
says,
“i
want
you
take
a
look
at
the
picture
here.”
“picture
of
whom?”
“picture
of
the
defendant
we're
going
to
try.
and
while
we're
at,
let's
take
a
look
at
his
clothes.”
clothes
in
his
run
that
we
took
from
the
night
of
the
crime,
then
the
witnesses
come
into
court
and
they
say,
“sure,
we
identify
the
defendant.”
and
all
these
came
out
at
trial.
i
mean
any
right
thinking
juror
will
have
a
little
bit
of
doubt
about
the
validity
of
this
eyewitness
evidence
where
the
police
bring
in
photographs
and
shown
to
the
witnesses
just
before
trial.
i
mean,
crying
out
loud.
why
were
they
doing
it?
it
wasn't
just
for
the
fun
of
it.
now,
the
--
and
again,
to
show
you
what
kind
of
evidence
the
state
was
using
against
petitioner
which
would
cast
a
doubt
that
on
the
fact
that
he
was
a
robber.
to
have
this
man
who
says,
he
has
identified
he
could
have
recognized
the
robber
again
if
he
saw
him
in
the
next
100
years.
never
forget
his
face,
(inaudible).
this
man
comes
in
and
tells
that
--
tells
the
jury
that
he
didn't
remember
whether
the
robber
had
any
grease
on
his
face
for
example.
then
he
tells
the
jury,
didn't
remember
whether
the
robber
had
any
lip
glisters.
petitioner
had
a
decorative
lip
glisters
under
his
lip.
the
man
who
says
he
recognize
petitioner
a
hundred
years,
also
tells
the
jury
that
he
was
hot
when
he
went
to
the
line
up.
he
was
mad.
he
didn't
want
to
go
to
the
line
up.
he
had
work
to
do.
the
police
told
him
to
come
down
and
see
if
he
can
pick
out
the
suspect.
he
got
him
down
here.
you
got
all
these
witnesses
who
are
all
over
the
place
and
there
testimony.
and
if
you
look
in
the
brief,
you'll
see
they
describe
a
man
of
all
different
colors
and
sizes.
the
most
important
thing,
mr.
justice
stewart,
this
will
show
you
where
the
real
bite
of
this
promissory
rule
comes
in.
here,
the
district
attorney
when
the
case
was
on
remand
took
the
clothing
out
of
the
files
of
the
superior
court
and
the
destroyed
the
clothing
that
was
used
in
evidence
against
petitioner.
so,
there's
no
way
that
an
appellate
court
could
ever
look
at
that
clothing
and
see
if
it
were
being
properly
described
during
trial.
he
also
took
the
diagram
that
was
used
against
petitioner
trial.
what
happened
was
that
the
district
attorney
had
someone
come
in
from
his
office
and
make
a
rough
sketch
not
one
to
scale
and
says,
“well,
this
is
the
locations
of
the
various
robberies
and
so
forth.”
and
then,
when
this
court
remands
the
first
time,
not
the
second
time,
when
it
remand
the
first
time
for
considerations
under
griffin.
the
da
goes
into
the
files
takes
that
evidence
out,
takes
that
diagram
out
and
destroys
it.
he
also
destroyed
most
of
the
other
exhibits
and
it
was
only
by
good
fortune
that
petitioner
had
copies
and
we're
able
to
get
some
of
it
to
show
what
was
in
the
record.
they
denied
they
have
the
exhibits.
they
have
to
go
up
there
and
fight
to
get
the
exhibits.
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
no.
i'm
suggesting
the
case
dragged
on.
the
judgment
became
final
in
the
court
of
appeal.
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
no.
there
--
they're
nice
guys.
i
mean
they're
trying
to
do
their
job.
i'm
sure
when
they
--
if
it's
ever
thought
that
they're
violating
this
court's
mandate
they
wouldn't
have
done
it.
but
the
fact
remain
is
--
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
--
the
evidence
isn't
there?
then
when
--
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
oh,
no.
no.
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
no.
in
fact,
no.
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
yes,
i
am.
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
that
is
the
exact
advice
in
this
standard.
i
think
when
you
try
a
case
you
can
just
see
the
jury
sometimes
that
they
--
their
eyes
widen
at
certain
evidence,
where
was
the
missing
witness.
you
can
always
see
the
jury's
eyes
widen
at
that
and
that's
the
frustrating
part
about
the
harmless
error
rule.
you
just
can't
measure
the
impact
on
the
jury
when
come
up
on
appeal.
you
can
kill
by
a
single
bullet.
that
comment
at
the
end
of
trial
as
in
this
case
at
the
very
end
of
the
prosecutor's
argument
when
he
was
winding
up.
the
point
he
used
against
petitioners.
he
hadn't
got
up
on
the
stand
and
testified.
then
petitioner
got
up
in
his
argument
and
he
said,
“you've
tried
to
go
through
the
facts
and
went
through
about
showing
a
photographs
and
so
forth.”
and
said,
he
hadn't
testified
because
he
didn't
think
the
government
had
proved
its
case
and
so
on.”
the
prosecutor
got
right
back
up
after
that
and
said
to
the
jury,
“look
here
he
said,
you
can't
expect
all
the
witnesses
to
agree
in
what
they
saw
and
besides
the
line
up
showed
to
you
is
guilty.”
pick
him
out
right
there
these
people
and
beside
that
there's
lot
of
circumstantial
evidence
in
this
case,
lots
of
it.
let's
look
at
the
circumstantial
evidence.
the
prosecutor
said,
“this
is
the
whole
last
part
of
his
argument
to
the
jury,
closing
argument.”
he
said,
“petitioner
here
was
cool
--
cool,
you
saw
him
in
court.
how
cool
he
was
defending
himself.”
well,
the
robber
was
described
as
cool.
you
saw
that
--
heard
the
evidence
that
there
was
some
crumpled
money
in
petitioner's
pockets,
that's
circumstantial
evidence.”
other
circumstantial
evidence
is
that
when
petitioner
was
accused
of
being
the
robber
by
the
policeman
at
the
time
of
the
arrest
and
one
of
the
witnesses
said
to
him
in
the
line
up
quarter,
“that's
the
man”,
when
petitioner
remains
silent
there.
that's
evidence,
that's
circumstantial
evidence
of
guilt
and
you
can
take
into
consideration
of
fact
that
petitioner
didn't
testify.
and
the
courts
going
to
tell
you
and
i'm
telling
you
now
that
you
--
if
he
could
have
denied
it,
you'll
be
instructed
that
that
you
can
infer
that
he
wasn't
able
to
deny
it
and
you
can
take
his
failure
to
testify
in
consideration.
now,
petitioner's
defense
basically
was
--
it
was
former.
he
earned
his
money.
he's
been
working
in
pittsburgh,
a
little
town
outside
of
concord,
outside
of
oakland
and
if
prosecutor
got
up
and
he
said,
well,
we
know
that
as
his
last
punch
of
petitioner
after
this
other
failure
to
testify
business.
he
got
up
and
said,
well,
you
know
petitioner
says
he
earned
his
money
and
so
forth.
but
we
all
know
lots
of
people
have
bills
and
things
like
that
and
we
don't
know
that
the
money
of
the
petitioner
had
in
his
pocket
was
the
same
money
he
earned
because
he
hasn't
got
to
understand
and
told
you.”
and
then
he
says
petitioner
asked
why
people
rob?
he
said,
you
can
ask
lots
of
people
why
people
rob.
lots
of
persons
you
could
ask
that
question
too.
and
then
he
says
to
the
jury
at
the
very
end
winding
up,
you
can
take
in
consideration
not
just
the
direct
evidence
but
look
at
all
these
circumstantial
evidence,
who
have
just
been
talking
about.
you
can
reach
your
verdict
on
that
and
then
the
court
went
on
to
instruct
on
this
accusations
that
that
was
something
jury
could
consider
in
his
admission
of
guilt,
instructed
on
a
failure
to
testify.
the
state
makes
a
big
deal
out
of
petitioner
coping
somewhere
from
the
california
standard
instruction
book
in
the
long
hand,
an
instruction
on
the
failure
to
testify
and
giving
it
to
the
judge.
the
judge
had
already
told
petitioner
he's
going
to
give
the
instruction.
the
judge
didn't
give
the
instruction,
petitioner
tried
to
write
out
to
give
a
far
more
damning
one.
they
told
the
jury
that
if
petitioner
was
in
the
position
to
understand
all
these
and
know
the
facts
and
then
deny
him.
then
the
jury
could
take
that
into
consideration.
there
is
one
point,
the
other
point
i
want
to
test
--
bring
up
not
testify
to
and
that's
the
denial
of
counsel
of
trial.
now,
petitioner
had
been
represented
by
the
public
defender
at
the
preliminary
hearing
and
at
the
arraignment.
and
as
you
can
see
from
the
bringing
of
briefs
there
are
three
crimes
it
was
important
that
if
he
could
as
a
tactical
matter.
the
petitioner
would
be
tried
separately
on
each
of
those
crimes
because
any
avoid
that
overlap
and
the
modus
operandi
argument
that
the
like
the
prosecutor
made.
so,
petitioner
goes
to
your
--
to
the
arraignment
and
that
public
defender
tells
the
judge,
he
wants
to
make
a
motion
for
separate
trials.
alright,
but
then
instead
of
arguing
the
motion,
he
tells
the
judge,
we'll
take
it
under
submission.
next
week
or
so,
they
come
back
to
court
for
a
hearing
and
the
judge
turns
to
the
public
--
to
the
prosecutor
and
says,
what
do
you
have
to
say
about
this
motion
for
separate
trials
that
prosecutor,
the
da
makes
his
speech.
then
petitioner,
his
lawyer
gets
up
and
says,
“well,
the
pleadings
are
defective.”
that's
about
it
and
the
court
overrules
the
motion
for
separate
trials.
petitioner
then
the
next
time
they
go
to
court,
petitioner
asked
that
public
defender
if
he
can
ask
the
court
a
question
you
--
it
says
the
judge,
"so
your
honor,
i
don't
think
its
constitutional,
if
the
(inaudible)
at
the
same
time
for
these
crimes
and
instead
of
defending
the
standing
up
for
his
client.
the
public
defender
says
the
judge,
“well
your
honor,
you
said
the
--
this
is
the
same
thing
i
raised
before
a
couple
of
weeks
ago
and
you
already
ruled
against
petitioner
on
it.
he's
just
raising
the
same
point
now
on
put
on
a
different
constitutional
ground.”
and
then
the
defendant
says,
“i
think
it's
reasonable
but
so
forth,
and
the
judges
out
hearing
from
the
da
simply
goes
ahead
and
denies
the
motion.”
two
weeks
later
petitioner
comes
back
before
the
judge
for
a
hearing
to
set
a
trial
date.
he
says
to
the
judge
butts
in,
it
says,
your
honor,
can
you
take
care
of
this
constitutional
thing
for
me.
and
that
--
and
on
similar
facts
and
the
public
defendant
says,
“i
don't
know
his
talking
about
now”
to
the
judge.
he
says,
“you've
already
ruled
on
the
motion
for
separate
trials.”
and
then
the
judge
denied,
the
judge
law
is
talking
about
separate
trial
in
each
of
the
three
counts
and
the
motion
is
denied.
and
then
petitioner
said,
“i
don't
want
to
be
represented
anymore
by
the
public
defender.”
the
court
looks
at
the
charges
so
you
can't
put
a
serious
crimes
can't
waive
it,
can't
waive
a
defense.
but
the
petitioner
says,
i
don't
want
to
be
represented
by
this
man
anymore.
it
doesn't
look
to
me
like
public
defender's
office
is
any
match
for
the
da
around
here
not
qualified.
that
will
and
the
judge
says,
alright,
you
can
go
to
trial
by
yourself
but
we'll
have
someone
from
the
public
defender's
office
sit
inside
the
courtroom
with
you
behind
there
and
will
help
you
out.
and
just
then
the
public
defender
apply
his
evidence
says,
“wait
a
minute,
your
honor.
can
i
be
heard?
looks
this
guy
looks
like
a
wise
guy.
he's
trying
to
pull
something
off
and
his
trying
to
look
like
a
poor
little
man
infront
of
the
public,
infront
of
the
da
being
picked
upon.”
if
one
of
his
legal
points
bounces
on
him,
it's
going
to
be
real
tough.
he
says,
“i
don't
want
any
part
of
this
mixed
merit.
either
we
go
--
either
he
goes
along
or
he
goes
with
us.”
and
the
court
then
said
to
the
public
defender,
listen,
you
have
someone
here
in
court.
so
the
next
day
--
about
two
weeks
later,
petitioner
comes
up
for
trial
before
a
different
judge.
this
judge
hears
about
petitioner
wanting
counsel
and
he
requires
in
the
petitioners
background.
he
finds
out
that
he's
got
a
record,
a
young
man
in
illinois
have
been
convicted
for
murder.
he's
been
out
for
parole
in
california.
working
as
a
plumber
up
in
pittsburgh,
sixth
grade
education,
mentally
defective,
he's
been
in
the
hospital
for
mental
treatment
and
emotionally
upset
about
the
charges.
the
judge
says,
“look!”
he
says,
“you
can't
defend
yourself.
this
is
--
no
man
should
defend
himself
in
felony
charge.”
and
petitioner
says,
“i'm
not
going
to
stick
with
this
public
defender.
i
want
someone
that
qualified,
someone
i
have
confidence.”
the
judge
says,
“well,
take
the
public
defender
or
nobody.”
meanwhile,
while
all
of
these
are
going
on
of
course.
there's
an
assistant
public
defender
listening
to
it,
happens
at
trial
what
was
being
said.
the
case
comes
back,
the
judge
says,
“well
alright,
you
have
to
go
by
yourself.
i
can't
give
any
help.
then
petitioner
in
the
real
flash
of
brilliance
says
the
judge,
“well,
i
look
better
on
appeal
if
i
go
up
without
counsel.”
and
the
judge
jump
up
and
said,
“what
do
you
mean
by
that?”
petitioner
said,
“what
i
mean
is,
i
think
i
still
have
a
right
to
counsel
that
points
some
other
than
the
public
defender.
so,
he
goes
before
the
next
judge.
he
disqualifies
the
judge,
he
asked
for
change
of
venue
to
go
back
before
the
first
guy.
he
gets
back
before
the
first
judge,
the
one
who
heard
the
public
defender
call
him
a
wise
guy.
petitioner
and
this
judge
says,
“well,
you
can
still
have
the
public
defender.”
petitioner
says,
“i
don't
want
the
public
defender.
just
appoint
anybody
from
the
open
bar,
just
anybody,
other
than
a
public
defender.
somebody
i
can
believe
in.”
the
judge
says,
“go
to
trial
as
a
public
defender
without
anybody.”
and
then
he
says,
“well.”
then
petitioner
says,
“well,
how
about
this
guy
who's
been
sitting
here,
the
assistant
public
defender.”
the
assistant
public
defender
was
present
during
the
second
proceeding
when
all
this
come
out
of
our
petitioner's
background
and
so
forth.
he
didn't
say
a
word
to
the
judge
about
that.
he
just
kept
his
mouth
shut.
so
the
third
judge,
i
mean
with
the
first
judge,
who
heard
petitioner
call
the
wise
guy
was
it
--
finally
the
judge
who
tried
this
case
but
the
public
defender
who
was
in
between
him,
both
didn't
report
back
to
this
--
to
the
trial
judge
the
way
heard
at
the
prior
proceeding.
the
petitioner
had
a
sixth
grade
education
and
he
was
all
--
he
was
a
plumber
and
so
forth,
and
so
petitioner
goes
to
trial.
and
the
first
thing
the
da
--
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
well,
if
you
read
--
if
you
see
what
the
judge
said
during
board
there
mr.
justice.
petitioner
is
conducting
his
word
at
the
jury
see,
here
he
is
all
alone.
the
judge
he
says
to
the
jury,
he's
trying
to
explain
what
separate
defenses
are.
if
the
jury
can
keep
it
straight
and
if
one
of
the
jury
says,
“i
don't
understand
the
question.”
the
judge
says
the
juror,
“well,
you
can
come
over
here
and
join
me.”
and
then
another
time
during
the
board
hearing
the
judge
--
petitioner
is
asking
the
jury
about
juvenile
delinquency
and
i'll
shut
up
right
after
this.
but
he
asked
the
judge
about
--
he's
asking
about
juvenile
delinquency
and
the
judge
says
to
the
petitioner,
“you
look
a
little
bit
old
to
be
talking
about
juvenile
delinquency,
ha
-
ha
-
ha.”
and
there's
petitioner
taking
it
on
the
chin.
thank
you.
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
i
wish
to,
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
black,
mr.
justice
black,
you
asked
about
the
evidence
at
trial
pointing
to
the
petitioner.
there
was
lots
of
doubt
the
petitioner
was
robber.
in
petitioner's
pocket,
the
police
found
a
$176.00
within
half
an
hour.
the
robber
had
obtained
the
$235.00
to
$265.00
in
cash.
furthermore,
the
last
robbery,
the
one
involving
polititch
and
that
had
some
20's,
twenty
dollar
bills.
when
the
police
search
petitioner,
they
didn't
find
any
twenty
dollar
bills
on
him.
he
didn't
have
any.
at
the
last
liquor
store
where
petitioner
was
arrested.
there
was
absolutely
no
attempt
to
rob
that
liquor
store.
the
clerk
on
duty
testified
during
trial
that
there
was
no
attempt
at
all,
and
made
it
to
rob
the
liquor
store.
the
petitioner
had
not
done
anything
except
make
that
comment.
there
was
one
witness
who
saw
the
robber
come
out
of
the
last
liquor
store
and
he
saw
the
robber
come
out
the
store,
and
go
down
the
street.
he
walked
out
after
the
robber
and
followed
him,
saw
him
get
into
a
car
and
drive
away.
that
man
was
called
to
testify
at
trial.
he
could
not
identify
the
robber.
he
did
not
identify
the
petitioner
as
the
robber.
he
couldn't
identify
anyone.
significantly,
that
one
witness
was
the
only
one
of
all
the
states
witnesses
that
wasn't
shown
a
photograph
of
petitioner
before
trial
and
it
didn't
take
part
in
the
suggestive
line
up
outlined
in
our
brief
or
in
the
show
up.
he
was
the
only
one
who
hadn't
been
exposed
to
petitioner
before
hand.
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
yes,
sir.
i'm
glad
you
ask
the
question
because
here's
what
they
stand
for
and
these
are
cases
in
the
california
district
court
of
appeal
where
after
its
judgment
became
final,
the
90
days
passed.
the
court
of
appeals
modified
its
opinion
like
the
court
did
here.
it
didn't
modify
the
judgment.
the
judgment
still
stayed
the
same
but
it
modified
the
opinion
in
it.
and
from
the
modification
of
the
opinion,
there
was
a
petition
of
the
california
supreme
court
for
a
hearing
and
here's
what
the
california
supreme
court
said.
it
said,
a
different
situation
would
be
presented
if
the
modification
by
the
district
court
of
appeals
had
been
solely
with
regard
to
its
opinion
such
a
modification
would
not
have
affected
the
judgment
which
would
in
that
event
had
become
final
and
that
court
on
the
date
specified.
and
the
supreme
court
wouldn't
have
barred
to
grant
review.
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
right.
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
well,
the
judgment
--
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
yes,
your
honor.
but
the
judgment
was
still
basically
the
same
as
it
had
been
in
the
case
to
all
the
time.
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
something
had
to
be
done
to
it,
it
had
to
be
reentered.
under
the
california
rules
of
appeal
mr.
justice,
even
had
the
petitioner
file
the
petition
rule
29
of
the
california
rules
prohibits
a
california
supreme
court
from
reviewing
just
on
factual
questions.
and
under
that
rule,
the
california
supreme
court
will
not
look
behind
the
statement
of
facts
or
the
dealing
with
factual
matters
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
its
opinion.
now,
let's
not
cite
any
of
the
briefs
but
it
is
upstairs
in
one
of
these
west
books,
its
rule
29.
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
as
--
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
--
as
i
thought,
these
cases
here
ended
the
matter
when
the
california
supreme
court
says,
it's
as
long
as
the
judgment
remains
the
same
if
the
opinion
is
modified
that
doesn't
start
the
time
running
again.
but
as
an
additional
ground,
there
are
these
additional
grounds
that
kept
the
court's
own
rules
prohibit
review.
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
well,
you
must
remember
mr.
justice
that
this
time
petitioner
didn't
have
any
lawyer.
if
you're
going
to
say
the
petitioner
already
have
to
go
back
up
and
down,
then
it
becomes
important
to
decide
whether
petitioner
had
a
right
to
help
him
on
that
discretionary
review.
he
have
no
right
to
review
--
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
i'm
not
saying
that.
i'm
saying
the
petitioner
went
to
the
highest
court
of
the
state.
the
court
denied
him
review.
at
that
point,
the
judgment
under
california
law
became
final
by
anybody
standards.
when
the
case
came
back
down
again,
there
was
no
tampering
with
that
judgment.
the
judgment
remained
the
same.
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
it
was
vacated.
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
it
was
reaffirmed.
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
you
vacated
your
older
decision
--
you
vacated
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
no,
he
didn't
vacate
that.
that
remained
in
effect.
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
follow
your
question
mr.
justice.
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
oh,
the
first
time
out?
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
i
believe
it
was
the
judgment,
if
not
let
me
answer
this
way
because
there's
necessary
question
here
in
california.
now,
once
the
california
supreme
court
takes
his
discretionary
review
and
it
can
do
it
on
its
motion
or
on
petition.
once
it
does
that,
the
whole
court
of
appeals
proceeding
becomes
another
nullity
as
though
it
never
existed.
the
opinion
can't
be
cited
for
anything
as
no
authorities
present
or
anything
else.
so
in
that
case,
when
it
goes
up
to
the
california
supreme
court
is
then
reviewing
the
judgment
in
the
trial
court.
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
that
ends
it.
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
correct.
that's
right.
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
that's
right.
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
it's
the
reinstatement
of
the
original
judgment.
i
mean,
it
wasn't
any
change
in
the
judgment.
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
well,
then
mr.
justice,
the
judgment
was
affirmed.
that's
right,
the
judgment
of
the
trial
court.
but
where
was
petitioner
during
this
time
when
the
case
is
back
down
again.
he
was
still
in
jail.
the
judge
in
the
trial
court
was
still
in
effect.
sure
you
that
of
course
--
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
if
i
were
a
lawyer
in
california
advising
petitioner
at
this
time.
i
would
say,
you
did
not
have
to
go
to
the
california
supreme
court
because
of
the
two
cases
i
cited
and
because
of
my
knowledge
of
the
california
rules,
rules
29
which
says
that
the
california
supreme
court
can't
look
into
these
factual
matters.
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
the
whole
harmless
error
rule
mr.
justice
is
one
of
fact.
you're
looking
at
the
overall
--
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
yes,
every
case
involves
that.
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
well,
let
me
just
come
back
to
mr.
justice
marshall's
point.
mr.
justice,
those
two
cases
that
i
cited
in
my
brief
i
think
on
why
the
california
supreme
court
couldn't
do
it
but
want
it
to
point
up
the
whole
heart
of
the
matter.
now,
as
to
the
argument
on
appeal
as
to
whether
there
should
have
been
oral
argument.
the
california
statute
says,
“that
a
california
appellate
court
in
a
criminal
case
cannot
reverse
a
judgment
unless
it's
his
argument,
that
section
1253
of
penal
code.”
now,
counsel
has
informed
me
that
in
douglas
against
california
which
is
the
--
remember
the
right
to
counsel
case
on
appeal.
there
was
a
remand
to
the
dca
for
further
consideration
in
that
case
that
after
the
dca
appointed
counsel.
there's
another
issue
brought
up
about
counsel
at
trial
and
then
the
supreme
court
granted
a
hearing.
california
supreme
court
granted
a
petition
on
that
different
issue
on
light
of
counsel
at
trial.
but
here
you
weren't
having
in
this
case,
different
issues
coming
up,
your
still
having
the
same
rule
issue
each
time.
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
but
while
it
was
merely
your
honor
in
reply
to
justice
white's
question.
there
is
the
douglas
case
is
an
example
where
after
this
court
remanded
it
to
view
in
light
of
this
decision.
the
district
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
case,
petitioner
or
appellant
at
that
point,
petition
the
california
supreme
court
for
a
hearing.
their
number
of
issues
and
they
granted
a
hearing.
it
went
off
in
that
point
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
he
was
entitled
to
separate
counsel
at
trial
but
they
granted
the
hearing
and
reverse
the
case,
to
reply
justice
white's
question.
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
penal
code
section
1253,
mr.
chief
justice.
it
says,
“the
judgment
may
be
affirmed
if
the
appellant
to
failed
to
appear.
but
can
be
reverse
only
after
argument
though
the
respondent
failed
to
appear.
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
that's
right.
well,
you
--
the
question
that
you
were
concerned
about
was
the
oral
argument.
there
are
some
inquiries
about
the
rules
and
i
just
bring
that
up
to
be
--
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
--helpful.
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
yes,
unless
the
court
has
some
additional
questions.
mr.
thomas
j.
klitgaard
thank
you.
mr.
thomas
