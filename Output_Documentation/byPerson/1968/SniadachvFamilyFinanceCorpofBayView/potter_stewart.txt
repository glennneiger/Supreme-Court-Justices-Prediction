justice
potter
stewart
and
that's
a
one-shot
proposition
under
wisconsin
law?
justice
potter
stewart
but
that's
all?
it
can't
be
done
again,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
right
under
the
same
underlying
claim?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
sum
total
is
this
$31.00
or
$32.00.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
--
the
new
federal
law
is
limited
25%
of
what?
justice
potter
stewart
that
would
be
a
great
deal
more
than
was
the
garnishee
here,
wouldn't
it?
this
was
a
total
of
$32.00.
justice
potter
stewart
if
they
can
keep
taking
it
so
far
as
the
new
federal
law
does.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
so,
it
should
be
a
great
deal
more.
yes,
up
to
the
amount
of
the
debt.
petitioner
had
no
notice
of
hearing
before
the
wages
where
garnishee
does
mention,
and
the
co
--
because
the
garnishment
action
and
the
principle
action
were
commenced
simultaneously
by
service
upon
her
of
the
complaint
in
the
principal
action
at
her
place
of
employment,
at
the
same
time
the
complaint
in
the
garnishment
action
was
served
upon
her
employer.
in
fact,
while
it
did
not
occur
under
the
statute,
it
would
have
been
entirely
possible
to
serve
her
10
days
later,
and
the
first
notice
she
might
have
received
would've
been
after
the
sum
of
her
pay
had
indeed
been
garnered.
this
case
is,
therefore,
unlike
a
post
judgment
garnishment
case
in
which
there
has
been
an
adjudication
of
the
existence
of
the
debt.
it's
unlike
a
foreign
attachment
case
in
some
of
the
cases
relied
on
below
and
which
funds
are
attached
to
effect
jurisdiction
or
to
assure
payment
by
someone
who
is
not
in
the
jurisdiction.
funds
owing
to
petitioner
here
have
been
withheld
by
her
employer
upon
order
of
the
court,
and
those
funds
will
not
paid
either
to
her
or
to
her
employer
until
the
termination
of
the
principal
action
which
has
been,
in
this
particular
case,
has
been
stayed
and
has
not
yet
been
heard
and,
indeed
in
any
case,
will
be
heard
some
considerable
period
of
time
after
the
wages
have
been
attached.
in
the
trial
court,
petitioner
made
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
garnishment
proceeding
on
the
ground
of
unconstitutionality
under
the
due
process
clause
of
the
constitution,
asserting
that
there
was
neither
notice
nor
hearing
as
required
by
the
constitution,
and
this
claim
was
denied
by
all
of
the
wisconsin
courts.
in
relating
what
occurred
to
the
court,
i
have
outlined
essentially
the
statutory
scheme,
but
i'd
like
to
set
it
forth
somewhat
more
fully.
the
way
actions
like
this
start
is
that,
in
an
action
upon
contract,
in
action
in
tort,
or
an
action
upon
a
judgment,
upon
payment
of
$3-fee
to
the
clerk
of
the
court,
a
complaint
in
garnishment
--
summons
in
complaint
in
garnishment
may
be
obtained
by
a
creditor.
the
garnishment
complaint
need
allege
merely
that
the
cause
is
one
of
the
three
specified
in
the
statute,
contract
tort
or
judgment,
the
amount
of
the
plaintiff's
claim
against
the
defendant,
and
that
the
garnishee
has
a
property
owing
to
the
defendant.
that's
all.
the
garnishment
complaint
and
summons
must
be
served
upon
the
principal
defendant
no
more
than
10
days
after
service
on
the
garnishee,
and
the
garnishee
then
may
either
hold
the
money
or
may
pay
it
into
court.
under
the
statute,
the
garnishment
action
is
not
permitted
to
be
tried
until
after
judgment
in
the
principal
action.
and
as
i
said,
depending
upon
the
outcome
of
the
principal
action,
the
moneys
are
then
distributed.
our
principal
claim
here
is
based
upon
the
due
process
clause
of
the
constitution,
which
we
assert
and
we
submit
needs
no
elaboration
in
this
court,
requires
notice
and
hearing
before
adverse
judicial
action
may
be
taken
against
one
to
deprive
that
person
of
property.
but
to
demonstrate
that
in
this
case
we
are
hardly
speaking
of
empty
ritual
or
formalism
and
that
we're
not
addressing
the
constitution
to
some
procedural
quirk,
our
brief
contains
a
considerable
quantity
of
material
showing
the
well-recognized
social
and
economic
evils
that
this
type
of
statute
brings
about.
indeed,
the
opinion
below
acknowledges
this
and
the
respondent
acknowledges
it.
the
current
commission
report
takes
special
notice
of
it
as
a
particularly
unjust
and
abrasive
factor
in
dealings
between
merchants
and
loan
companies
and
the
poor.
prejudgment
garnishment
often,
of
course,
is
the
paying
of
debts
which
may
not
be
owed,
which
may
be
disputed.
it
often
encourages
an
employer
to
discharge
someone
rather
than
go
through
the
bookkeeping
trouble
of
going
through
the
garnishment
proceeding.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
unless
it's
a
default
judgment
without
notice,
then
you'd
have
the
same
problem.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
they're
basically
the
same.
justice
potter
stewart
do
i
understand
you
to
say
that
there
are
20
states
that
have
the
same
kind
of
statute
as
this
is
one?
justice
potter
stewart
oh,
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
because
this
particular
statute,
seems
to
me,
to
the
subject
to
the
argument
you're
making,
that
it's
highly
unfair
to
the
debtor
but
also
subject
to
the
argument
that
it's
highly
inadequate
to
protect
the
creditor,
this
fraction
of
one
pay
period.
justice
potter
stewart
you're
not
suggesting
then
that
the
other
--
that,
as
matter
of
fact,
that
the
other
16
or
17
states,
whatever
they
are,
have
the
same
features
that
the
wisconsin
statute
has
--
justice
potter
stewart
limiting
it
to
one
pay
period.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
rather
peculiar
about
this
statute,
if
not
unique.
justice
potter
stewart
recently,
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
does
wisconsin
have
procedures
available
to
a
judgment
of
creditor
similar
to
garnishment
or
attachment?
after
you
--
if
you'd
gone
and
gotten
your
judgmen
for
the
underlying
debt
--
justice
potter
stewart
then,
what
remedies
would
wisconsin
give
you?
justice
potter
stewart
with
the
same
limitation?
is
this
garnishment
just
a
fraction
of
one
pay
period?
justice
potter
stewart
but
my
question
is,
after
your
judgment
creditor,
what
are
your
remedies
given
by
wisconsin?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
what
if
you
get
--
what
if
you
get
a
judgment
for
$1,000.00
against
some
man
who's
an
employee
and
who's
making
a
$100.00
a
week,
what
are
your
legal
rights
as
a
judgment
creditor
against
that
judgment
debtor?
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
there
would
be
an
examination
of
the
judgment
debtor?
justice
potter
stewart
under
my
question,
he's
making
--
he's
got
wages
of
a
$100.00
a
week.
justice
potter
stewart
can
there
be
a
compulsory
assignment
of
a
fraction
of
his
wages?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that's
a
one-shot
proposition
under
wisconsin
law?
justice
potter
stewart
but
that's
all?
it
can't
be
done
again,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
right
under
the
same
underlying
claim?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
sum
total
is
this
$31.00
or
$32.00.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
--
the
new
federal
law
is
limited
25%
of
what?
justice
potter
stewart
that
would
be
a
great
deal
more
than
was
the
garnishee
here,
wouldn't
it?
this
was
a
total
of
$32.00.
justice
potter
stewart
if
they
can
keep
taking
it
so
far
as
the
new
federal
law
does.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
so,
it
should
be
a
great
deal
more.
yes,

amount
