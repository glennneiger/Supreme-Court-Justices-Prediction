mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
matter
of
prejudgment
garnishment
has
been
discussed
at
length
in
the
state
of
wisconsin,
especially
since
the
institution
of
the
original
suit
herein.
i
would
like
to
straighten
the
facts
out,
as
mr.
greenber
didn't
fully
cover
them.
the
situation
here
did
not
involve
the
amount
of
$420.00
as
such.
the
petitioner
here,
mrs.
sniadach,
actually
borrowed
the
sum
of
$1,800.00
and,
in
fact,
although
the
record
does
not
show
she
was
a
co-maker
with
her
husband,
this
was
taken
out
on
september
2,
1964,
and
i
stress
the
amount
$1,800.00
because
this
is
cash
on
the
line.
this
is
not
the
case,
as
most
people
are
familiar
with,
where
you
walk
into
a,
say,
a
credit
clothing
store
or
a
credit
furniture
store,
you
buy
a
suit,
you
buy
a
piece
of
furniture
where
the
actual
cost
is
$20.00
and
the
mark
up
can
be
up
to
$100.00
or
$150.00.
in
other
words,
whatever
they
can
--
the
traffic
can
bear,
they
will
charge.
this
was
cash
on
the
line.
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
as
to
--
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
for
$1,800.00,
mr.
justice.
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
her
actual
cash
was
in
the
neighborhood
of
$1,560.00.
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
that
is
right,
over
a
three-year
period.
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
interest
is
set
by
statute.
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
it
averages
out
over
the
entire
length
of
around
12%
to
14%.
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
i
don't
--
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
no,no.
in
wisconsin,
under
the
statute,
your
monthly
interest
is
what
we
term
on
a
small
loan
under
$300.00,
where
it's
based
at
2.5%
on
the
first
hundred,
2%
on
the
second
hundred,
and
1%
on
the
balance.
over
$300.00,
you
come
under
a
different
statute
where
the
interest
is
predetermined
and
you've
--
the
companies,
be
either
finance
company
or
a
bank,
follow
a
chart.
i
do
not
have
that
chart
with
me.
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
around
240
or
250.
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
over
--
i
believe
this
was
a
three-year
loan.
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
no,
for
the
entire
length
of
the
contract.
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
that
is
correct.
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
she
got
somewhere
around
$1,500.00
to
$1,550.00.
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
her
interest
rate
was
figured
on
the
$1,500.00.
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
on
the
amount
that
she
actually
got.
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
on
the
$1,560.00.
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
paid
back
on
monthly
installments.
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
if
she
prepays,
she
is
given
a
rebate
on
the
unearned
interest.
this
is
also
by
statute.
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
the
record
does
not
show
that,
your
honor,
mr.
justice.
i
would
like
to
state
this.
this
loan
was
taken
out
in
september
2,
1964.
now,
of
course,
we
come
to
a
very
interesting
question,
and
this
is
the
question
of
notice.
mr.
greenber
indicated
that
no
notice
was
necessary,
but
i've
dealt
with
these
matters
over
a
number
of
years
and
it's
a
question,
in
my
mind,
what
would
one
consider
as
notice?
true,
the
statute
does
not
specifically
say
that
you
have
to
give
notice
prior
to
a
garnishment,
but
in
this
situation,
this
principal
action
and
garnishment
was
not
instituted
until
november
16,
1966,
a
little
better
than
two
years
after
the
original
loan
was
made.
and
at
that
time,
she
owed
a
balance
that
is,
when
i
say
she,
i'm
talking
of
the
petitioner
and
her
husband,
of
$1,500.00,
so
that
i
know
the
general
practice
of
the
--
my
client
and
other
companies.
she
not
only
received
notice
of
what
was
going
to
happen
once
but
she
received
notice
over
a
period
of
months.
unlike
the
brief
of
the
petitioner
where
they
alleged
that
it
is
normal
practice
within
10
days
after
an
account
is
in
default
the
garnishment
is
issued,
this
in
fact
is
not
the
case.
in
fact,
if
a
check
could
be
made,
and
i
know
of
no
check
made
of
these
cases,
in
my
own
experience,
normally,
a
garnishment
is
not
instituted
for
a
period
of
anywhere
from
six
months
to
two
years
after
it
is
in
default
with
numerous
notices
being
sent
out.
i'll
agree
with
mr.
greenber
that
the
collection
method
is
highly
systematized,
but
i
do
not
see
where
this
can
be
criticized
because
i
think
the
best
system
setup
for
collection
of
debts
is
that
setup
by
the
internal
revenues
department
to
collect
unpaid
taxes
and
this,
i
will
state,
is
setup
to
an
nth-degree.
you
have
the
same
situation
here.
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
justice
marshall,
i
can
--
it
isn't
--
i
said
it
was
normally
somewhere
between
six
months
and
two
years.
in
this
particular
case,
--
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
on
the
average,
six
months
to
two
years
before
a
garnishment
is
put
in.
in
rare
circumstances
where
they
have
heard,
and
i
have
had
this
occasion,
that
the
man
has
quitting
his
--
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
i
don't
believe
anybody
--
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
from
the
finance
industry.
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
i
realize
that.
i'm
quite
aware
of
that,
mr.
justice.
in
this
case,
it
was
two
years.
i
would
just,
for
the
moment,
like
to
--
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
that
is
correct.
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
the
$1,500.00
and
some
odd
cents.
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
that's
right,
with
the
interest
--
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
she
is
--
the
interest
is
added
onto
the
amount
that
she
got.
the
interest
is
computed
in
advance.
she
is
not
paying
the
interest,
as
you
would
normally
figure
that
if
you
borrow
$1,000.00,
the
interest
is
computed,
say
at
--
may
expedite
matter,
say,
10%
per
anum.
and
as
you
go
along,
you
would
be
computing
the
interest
on
a
monthly
payment.
the
interest
is
computed
in
advance
for
the
total
term
of
the
loan,
so
that
when
she
is
paying
it
back,
she
is
paying
back
the
principal
plus
the
predetermined
interest.
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
for
the
whole
period.
in
the
event
she
pays
the
loan
up,
say,
within
12
months
instead
of
24
or
36.
she
would
be
given
a
refund
of
the
interest
that
has
not
been
used
up.
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
no,
no.
it
--
the
--
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
in
the
note
itself,
which
is
not
in
record,
which
showed
a
principal
amount
$1,500.00,
interest
$300.00.
her
payments
would
be
setup
on
the
$1,800.00,
say
$24
at
x-dollars
per
month.
she
does
not
pay
any
additional
interest.
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
on
the
$1,800.00,
the
principal
amount
that
she
received
plus
the
pre-computed
for
the
entire
length
of
the
loan.
there's
one
thing
i
would
like
to
--
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
the
loan
was
due,
i
believe
it
was,
in
three
years,
and
the
loan
was
made
on
september
2,
1964.
the
first
installment
was
due
on
october
2,
1964.
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
the
installment
payments
were
--
this
alone,
in
question,
was
30
months
at
$60.00
a
month.
and
--
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
the
principal
interest.
let
me
correct
myself,
justice
fortas.
the
full
amount
of
the
loan
was
$180.00
and
i
am
looking
at
one
of
the
--
a
copy
of
the
note
in
question.
discount
that
was
charged
was
$322.50
which
is
computed
at
$15.89
per
annum,
simple
interest.
there
was
a
service
fee
of
$9.45.
she
received
$1,468.05.
it
was
the
net
amount
of
the
loan.
now,
justice
white,
in
answer
to
your
query
where
you
mentioned
attachment
and
replevin.
i
would
like
to
state
this,
that
the
attachment
and
replevin
are
set
up
separately
in
the
state
of
wisconsin.
they
are
not
considered
in
the
same
nature
as
a
garnishment
although,
to
a
certain
extent,
they
act
in
the
same
manner,
so
that,
we're
not
too
concerned
with
attachment
and
replevin
here.
in
fact,
as
mr.
--
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
you
don't
put
them
aside,
except
for
this.
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
well,
may
i
clarify
this
for
you,
justice
white?
in
a
matter
of
a
replevin,
this
can
be
started
in
one
of
two
ways.
first
of
all,
you
can
start
the
replevin
by
the
issuance
of
your
summons,
take
it
to
the
sheriff
without
any
seizure,
and
the
matter
is
then
returnable
within
8
to
15
days
after
issuance,
and
it
can
be
heard
by
the
court.
at
that
time,
the
court
can
enter
a
judgment
in
replevin,
as
i
term
it,
in
the
alternative,
either
you
get
the
cash
or
the
merchandise
back.
this
is
used
where
you
have
a
conditional
sales
contract
or
today,
under
the
uniform
code,
a
security
device.
the
other
way
or
the
other
alternative
on
a
replevin
is
that
you
can
issue
the
same
papers
but,
at
the
time
of
issuance
to
the
sheriff,
you
post
a
bond
with
the
sheriff
to
double
the
value
of
the
merchandise
which
you
seek
to
repossess.
the
sheriff,
then,
serves
a
copy
upon
the
debtor
or
defendant
and
leaves
a
copy
of
the
bond
with
him,
takes
the
furniture
in
his
possession,
and
i'm
saying
the
sheriff's
possession,
where
it
is
held,
pending
the
determination
by
the
court.
the
same
type
of
a
remedy
is
true
in
the
attachment.
and
in
these
two
cases,
you
post
a
bond.
this
you
do
not
have
to
do
in
a
garnishment.
a
garnishment
issue
is
forthwith
and
a
levy
is
made
upon
the
employer
who
answers.
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
well,
a
garnishment
would
be
on
a
wages
--
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
bank
accounts,
except
--
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
debts
due,
you
could
but
normally
you
would
attach
--
there's
micro-seizures
are
going
to
attach
on
a
debt
due.
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
garnishee
on
a
bank
account.
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
that's
a
debt
due,
but
i
prefer
an
attachment
on
a
debt
due,
of
course,
depending
upon
the
amount.
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
well,
the
easiest
--
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
you
don't
have
to
put
up
a
bond,
but
--
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
justice
marshall,
let's
carry
it
--
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
it
isn't
$3.50.
now,
this
is
a
misconception
that
the
court
has
been
advised
and
this,
i
assume,
is
because
mr.
greenber
does
not
practice
in
wisconsin.
this
is
also
why
it's
a
fallacy
to
say
that
for
only
$3.00
any
creditor
can
go
and
get
his
money.
the
actual
cost
out
of
pocket
disbursements
on
a
garnishment
of
under
$500.00,
which
is
the
small-claimed
limit
in
the
state
of
wisconsin
is,
$15.20.
in
other
words,
my
client
is
$15.00
--
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice.
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
well,
after
two-and-a
half
--
after
over
two
years
of
attempting
to
get
the
money
with
numerous
letters,
my
client
instructed
me
to
proceed
with
the
garnishment
because,
voluntarily,
mrs.
sniadach
wouldn't
even
bother
to
call
or
come
in.
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
that
is
correct.
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
no,
we're
not
too
concerned
with
the
employer,
quite
frankly.
as
a
practical
situation,
certain
companies,
and
i
will
name
them:
a.o.
smith
corporation,
allis-chalmers
corporation,
harness
fissure,
american
motors,
have
a
policy
of
discharge
after
so
many
garnishments
of
which
we
are
well-aware,
and
we
are
well-aware
of
it
because
the
individual
plants
have
setup
special
personnel
departments
to
work
with
these
employees
so
that,
before
a
garnishment
is
issued,
i
know
as
a
practical
situation
and
as
an
actuality
that
this
matter
has
been
discussed
in
99
out
100
garnishments
with
the
personnel
manager
or
the
party
who's
in
charge,
they
call
him
a
labor
relations
expert
or
an
expediter
and
normally
he
has
said,
“look,
i
can't
do
anything.
i
have
the
men
in
here.
you'll
have
to
garnishee
if
you
want
to
get
your
money."
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
yes,
it
bans
discharge.
now,
how
effective
that
would
be,
mr.
justice
douglas,
i
don't
know.
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
discharge
for
one
debt,
but
the
problem
here
is
that
when,
normally,
you
have
to
resort
to
a
garnishment,
you
have
deepened
a
path
to
the
door,
either
personally,
telephone
calls,
or
letters
in
an
attempt
to
get
a
payment
or
something
on
the
account
rather
than
garnishee
and,
it's
been
my
experience
that
if
you
have
been
doing
this,
god
only
knows
how
many
other
creditors
are
attempting
to
obtain
the
money,
too,
because,
practically,
these
people
don't
only
owe
you,
they
owe
others.
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
the
actual
outweigh
of
cost
is
chargeable
to
the
debtor
or
defendant.
as
a
practical
situation,
if
you
can
get
your
principal
amount
back
most
of
the
banks,
finance
companies,
unlike
your
credit
clothing
or
furniture
companies,
will
be
more
glad
to
take
their
principal
and
waive
interest
and
all
other
charges.
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
taking
this
situation
here,
i
can
state
this.
that,
although
there
is
nothing
in
these
statutes
specifically
calling
for
an
immediate
trial,
that
as
a
practical
situation
in
this
matter,
had
it
not
been
for
the
fact
that
this
was
to
be
a
test
case,
that
this
matter
could
have
been
tried
within
24
to
48
hours
after
the
court
have
been
notified
that
her
check
have
been
tied
up.
the
--
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
on
this
indebtedness?
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
this
action
was
instituted
on
sep
--
on
november
16,
1966,
assuming
that
i
follow
the
minimum
of
eight
days
--
service
within
eight
days
of
the
date
of
issuance,
which
would
mean
that
this
action,
both
the
principal
and
garnishment,
would
be
returnable
in
the
county
court
or
the
small
claim
court
on
the
24th
day
of
november.
now,
the
statute
does
provide
for
an
immediate
trial
on
the
return
date,
and
if
the
situation
is
so
urgent,
as
had
been
indicated
here,
the
matter
could
have
been
tried
on
the
return
day
and
the
court
would
have
handed
down
a
decision
on
that
date.
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
in
theory,
within
30
days
--
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
well,
normally,
if
you're
saying
just
to
start
the
principal
action
and
forget
the
garnishment?
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
normally,
around
30
days.
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
yes,
there
are
exceptions
if
the
--
because
of
illness
of
one
of
the
presiding
judges
where
you
have
to
transfer
calendars
but,
normally,
30
days.
generally,
60
days
is
the
longest,
barring
any
unforn
--
unforeseen
emergency.
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
mr.
chief
justice,
they
do
not.
the
notes
provide
that
an
attorney
fee
can
be
added
on.
there
is
no
provision
for
any
percentage.
the
attorney
fees
are
taxed
by
the
court,
normally
around
$5.00,
depending
upon
the
amount.
in
the
case
of
--
assuming
i'd
recovered
a
judgment
for
$1,800.00,
and
i
would
like
to
state
this
to
the
court,
being
over
$500.00,
if
i
had
sued
for
the
entire
amount,
at
the
time
this
suit
was
instituted,
there
would've
been
two
filing
fees.
so
that,
over
$500.00,
in
addition
to
the
cost
that
i've
mentioned,
there
would
be
a
$15.00-filing
fee
for
each
of
the
actions
on
the
principal
action
and
the
garnishment.
in
order
to
hold
the
court
cost
down,
i
chose
to
bring
an
action
for
back
payments
to
hold
it
under
$500.00.
today,
the
court
has
only
one
filing
fee
for
both
actions.
instead
of
$30.00,
there'd
be
a
$15.00-filing
fee
but,
assuming
that
i
had
instituted
suit
for
the
entire
$1,800.00,
this
is
over
the
small-claim
limit
which
the
maximum
is
$500.
this
probably
would
have
not
reached
trial
or
anywhere
between
six
months
and
a
year.
so,
on
a
large-claim,
we
have
a
different
waiting
period
than
we
do
on
a
small-claim
matter.
but
i
think
the
crux
of
the
question
before
the
court,
as
mr.
greenber
has
indicated,
this
is
a
deprivation
of
the
moneys
of
the
wage
earner,
and
i
would
agree
that
there
is
some
deprivation.
however,
this
is
a
sword
that
is
two-bladed.
you
have
a
party
here
that's
had
this
money
out
for
over
two
years
and
they
have
been
deprived
of
the
use
of
that
money.
i
think
we
are
well-aware
that,
today
in
business,
the
companies
and
the
banks
borrow
from
other
sources
in
which
they
pay
interest.
finance
companies
and
your
other
institutions
also
borrow,
and
they
pay
interest
on
this
money.
we
are
deprived
of
our
money.
the
creditor
sits
back
and
waits.
and
under
the
suggestion
of
mr.
greenber,
by
then,
the
creditor
would
be
the
one
sitting
back
holding
the
bag
and
the
debtor
is
the
one
that's
taking
advantage
of
the
situation
and
has
the
use
of
this
scot-free.
quite
frankly,
with
the
new
consumer
code
coming
in
the
truth
in
lending,
i
don't
know
who's
going
to
be
better
off,
the
creditor
or
the
debtor.
my
own
way
of
thinking,
and
this
is
contrary
to
some
of
the
articles
that
i
have
just
read
in
the
past
few
weeks,
they
are
now
coming
out
saying
that
even
under
the
new
credit
consumer
code,
which
goes
into
effect
july
of
1970,
i
believe,
that
the
creditor
is
still
coming
out
ahead
instead
of
the
debtor.
now,
i've
heard
comments
relative
to
this
and
to
the
truth
in
lending
bill.
i've
gone
over
the
bills.
i
haven't
gone
into
them
thoroughly
but,
to
my
way
of
thinking,
i
still
--
i
feel
that
the
--
today,
under
the
present
passage
of
these
two
bills,
we're
better
off
to
be
a
debtor
than
we
are
a
creditor.
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
then,
i
could've
proc
--
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
i
could
have
proceeded
with
a
garnishment.
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
yes.
in
fact,
let
me
put
it
to
you
this
way.
the
amount
held
is
$31.00
over,
say,
$60.00
actually
being
held.
under
the
wisconsin
statute,
a
single
person
is
given
an
exemption
of
$25.00.
now,
this
is
a
subsistence
allowance
so
that,
if
assuming
that
ms.--
mrs.sniadach,
and
she
was
single
at
that
time
or
she
was
divorced,
let
me
put
it
as
i
recall.
if
she
had
been
single,
she
would've
been
given
the
$25.00.
the
employer
properly
should
have
held
$41.00
and
not
$31.00.
if
she
was
with
dependence,
her
amount
that
would
have
to
be
given
to
her
first
is
$40.00,
so
that
the
employer
should
have
held
$26.00.
i
didn't
check
this.
i
didn't
argue
this.
this
is
the
amount
that
they
answered
when
they
came
in
and
we
let
it
go
with
that.
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
one
garnishment.
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
only
if
you
have
disposed
of
the
previous
garnishment.
in
other
words,
until
about
three
years
ago
when
they
change
the
statute,
it
was
possible
and
there
were
companies
doing
it.
some
of
these
credit
clothing
outfits
were
doing
it,
were
garnishing
every
week
and
tying
up
that
paycheck
before
they
had
even
disposed
of
the
previous
garnishment.
you
can
no
longer
do
this.
if
you
can
put
in
a
garnishment,
you
must
dispose
of
that
matter.
there
must
be
a
release.
there
must
be
an
official
or
judicial
determination.
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
that's
right,
you
can
garnishee.
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
still
have
those
limitations.
the
question
was
brought
up
relative
to
wage
assignments.
we
do
have
a
wage
assignment
law
in
wisconsin.
but
the
wage
assignment
is
limited
to
a
period
of
60
days
and
then,
normally,
the
amount
is
by
agreement
and,
in
the
case
of
these
manufacturing
companies,
the
employment
man
who
is
responsible
for
it
or
is
in
charge
of
working
with
the
employees
will
normally
suggest
the
amount
to
take
off.
he
reviews
the
situation
and
i
have
found,
personally,
that
they
are
more
than
considerate
of
the
needs
of
the
creditor,
as
well
as
the
needs
of
the
employee.
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
no,
i
don't
believe
it
is,
mr.
justice
fortas.
i
believe
that
a
garnishment
is
a
remedy
which
is
afforded
to
the
creditor,
strictly
a
feature
of
the
legislature,
no
question
of
it.
but
it
was
given
to
the
creditor
because
he
had
no
other
remedy,
and
i
think
it
is
more
important
today
than
it
was
15
years
ago
or
20
years
ago.
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
no,
it
only
affects
the
wages
due
as
of
the
date
of
service
of
the
garnishment
papers.
anything
earned
after
that
cannot
be
touched.
it's
strictly
a
one-shot
proposition.
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
i
can
only
levy
--
i
can
institute
a
garnishment
either
with
an
execution
or
without
an
execution
in
the
case
of
a
judgment
of
a
$1,000.00
where
your
garnishment
cost
are
not
$1,520.00,
but
every
time
you
would
issue
a
garnishment,
you
would
have
$30.00
involved
because
you
have
a
filing
fee.
in
such
a
case,
you
would
normally
issue
an
execution
and
then
bring
court
commissioner
proceeding
to
ascertain
if
the
man
has
any
assets
which
can
be
reached.
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
an
examination
of
the
judgment
debtor.
if
he
has
assets
under
our
statutes
--
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
his
wages
--
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
no,
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
compulsory
wage
assignment
in
wisconsin.
it
has
to
be
entirely
voluntarily
and
it
must
be
joined
in
by
the
wife,
if
the
man
is
married
and
has
a
family,
so
that
there
is
adequate
protection.
one
further
statement
relative
to
the
garnishment
that,
although
we
are
not
required
in
wisconsin
to
post
a
bond
at
the
time
of
a
garnishment,
there
is,
under
statute,
a
provision
that
if
there
is
a
wrongful
garnishment,
the
creditor
can
be
sued
for
wrongful
garnishment
and
there
are
actions
that
are
now
pending
and
have
been
tried
and
there
can
be
substantial
damages
for
a
wrongful
garnishment.
so,
i
feel
that
the
protection
is
well
afforded
and
that,
as
mr.
greenber
had
indicated,
there
had
been
five
attempts
or
five
bills
introduced
into
the
legislature
to
change
it.
the
last
change
was
several
years
ago,
limiting
the
garnishment
to
strictly
one
action
before
he
could
start
another
and
there
must
be
a
judgment
at
that
time.
thank
you.
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
as
to
--
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
if
you
have
a
judgment
over
$200.00,
the
judgment
can
be
docketed,
as
we
term
it,
and
it
then
automatically
becomes
a
lien
against
a
property,
which
is
only
good
if
the
equity
in
the
property
exceeds
the
$10,000
maximum.
there
is
a
$10,000
homestead
exemption.
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
on
real
estate.
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
personal
property,
there
is
outside
of
his
household
goods
and
furnishings
and
the
wages
on
his
exemption.
the
exemption
statute
in
wisconsin
follows
pretty
close
to
the
chandler
act
as
to
exemptions.
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
matter
of
prejudgment
garnishment
has
been
discussed
at
length
in
the
state
of
wisconsin,
especially
since
the
institution
of
the
original
suit
herein.
i
would
like
to
straighten
the
facts
out,
as
mr.
greenber
didn't
fully
cover
them.
the
situation
here
did
not
involve
the
amount
of
$420.00
as
such.
the
petitioner
here,
mrs.
sniadach,
actually
borrowed
the
sum
of
$1,800.00
and,
in
fact,
although
the
record
does
not
show
she
was
a
co-maker
with
her
husband,
this
was
taken
out
on
september
2,
1964,
and
i
stress
the
amount
$1,800.00
because
this
is
cash
on
the
line.
this
is
not
the
case,
as
most
people
are
familiar
with,
where
you
walk
into
a,
say,
a
credit
clothing
store
or
a
credit
furniture
store,
you
buy
a
suit,
you
buy
a
piece
of
furniture
where
the
actual
cost
is
$20.00
and
the
mark
up
can
be
up
to
$100.00
or
$150.00.
in
other
words,
whatever
they
can
--
the
traffic
can
bear,
they
will
charge.
this
was
cash
on
the
line.
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
as
to
--
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
for
$1,800.00,
mr.
justice.
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
her
actual
cash
was
in
the
neighborhood
of
$1,560.00.
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
that
is
right,
over
a
three-year
period.
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
interest
is
set
by
statute.
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
it
averages
out
over
the
entire
length
of
around
12%
to
14%.
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
i
don't
--
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
no,no.
in
wisconsin,
under
the
statute,
your
monthly
interest
is
what
we
term
on
a
small
loan
under
$300.00,
where
it's
based
at
2.5%
on
the
first
hundred,
2%
on
the
second
hundred,
and
1%
on
the
balance.
over
$300.00,
you
come
under
a
different
statute
where
the
interest
is
predetermined
and
you've
--
the
companies,
be
either
finance
company
or
a
bank,
follow
a
chart.
i
do
not
have
that
chart
with
me.
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
around
240
or
250.
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
over
--
i
believe
this
was
a
three-year
loan.
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
no,
for
the
entire
length
of
the
contract.
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
that
is
correct.
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
she
got
somewhere
around
$1,500.00
to
$1,550.00.
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
her
interest
rate
was
figured
on
the
$1,500.00.
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
on
the
amount
that
she
actually
got.
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
on
the
$1,560.00.
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
paid
back
on
monthly
installments.
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
if
she
prepays,
she
is
given
a
rebate
on
the
unearned
interest.
this
is
also
by
statute.
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
the
record
does
not
show
that,
your
honor,
mr.
justice.
i
would
like
to
state
this.
this
loan
was
taken
out
in
september
2,
1964.
now,
of
course,
we
come
to
a
very
interesting
question,
and
this
is
the
question
of
notice.
mr.
greenber
indicated
that
no
notice
was
necessary,
but
i've
dealt
with
these
matters
over
a
number
of
years
and
it's
a
question,
in
my
mind,
what
would
one
consider
as
notice?
true,
the
statute
does
not
specifically
say
that
you
have
to
give
notice
prior
to
a
garnishment,
but
in
this
situation,
this
principal
action
and
garnishment
was
not
instituted
until
november
16,
1966,
a
little
better
than
two
years
after
the
original
loan
was
made.
and
at
that
time,
she
owed
a
balance
that
is,
when
i
say
she,
i'm
talking
of
the
petitioner
and
her
husband,
of
$1,500.00,
so
that
i
know
the
general
practice
of
the
--
my
client
and
other
companies.
she
not
only
received
notice
of
what
was
going
to
happen
once
but
she
received
notice
over
a
period
of
months.
unlike
the
brief
of
the
petitioner
where
they
alleged
that
it
is
normal
practice
within
10
days
after
an
account
is
in
default
the
garnishment
is
issued,
this
in
fact
is
not
the
case.
in
fact,
if
a
check
could
be
made,
and
i
know
of
no
check
made
of
these
cases,
in
my
own
experience,
normally,
a
garnishment
is
not
instituted
for
a
period
of
anywhere
from
six
months
to
two
years
after
it
is
in
default
with
numerous
notices
being
sent
out.
i'll
agree
with
mr.
greenber
that
the
collection
method
is
highly
systematized,
but
i
do
not
see
where
this
can
be
criticized
because
i
think
the
best
system
setup
for
collection
of
debts
is
that
setup
by
the
internal
revenues
department
to
collect
unpaid
taxes
and
this,
i
will
state,
is
setup
to
an
nth-degree.
you
have
the
same
situation
here.
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
justice
marshall,
i
can
--
it
isn't
--
i
said
it
was
normally
somewhere
between
six
months
and
two
years.
in
this
particular
case,
--
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
on
the
average,
six
months
to
two
years
before
a
garnishment
is
put
in.
in
rare
circumstances
where
they
have
heard,
and
i
have
had
this
occasion,
that
the
man
has
quitting
his
--
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
i
don't
believe
anybody
--
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
from
the
finance
industry.
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
i
realize
that.
i'm
quite
aware
of
that,
mr.
justice.
in
this
case,
it
was
two
years.
i
would
just,
for
the
moment,
like
to
--
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
that
is
correct.
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
the
$1,500.00
and
some
odd
cents.
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
that's
right,
with
the
interest
--
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
she
is
--
the
interest
is
added
onto
the
amount
that
she
got.
the
interest
is
computed
in
advance.
she
is
not
paying
the
interest,
as
you
would
normally
figure
that
if
you
borrow
$1,000.00,
the
interest
is
computed,
say
at
--
may
expedite
matter,
say,
10%
per
anum.
and
as
you
go
along,
you
would
be
computing
the
interest
on
a
monthly
payment.
the
interest
is
computed
in
advance
for
the
total
term
of
the
loan,
so
that
when
she
is
paying
it
back,
she
is
paying
back
the
principal
plus
the
predetermined
interest.
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
for
the
whole
period.
in
the
event
she
pays
the
loan
up,
say,
within
12
months
instead
of
24
or
36.
she
would
be
given
a
refund
of
the
interest
that
has
not
been
used
up.
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
no,
no.
it
--
the
--
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
in
the
note
itself,
which
is
not
in
record,
which
showed
a
principal
amount
$1,500.00,
interest
$300.00.
her
payments
would
be
setup
on
the
$1,800.00,
say
$24
at
x-dollars
per
month.
she
does
not
pay
any
additional
interest.
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
on
the
$1,800.00,
the
principal
amount
that
she
received
plus
the
pre-computed
for
the
entire
length
of
the
loan.
there's
one
thing
i
would
like
to
--
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
the
loan
was
due,
i
believe
it
was,
in
three
years,
and
the
loan
was
made
on
september
2,
1964.
the
first
installment
was
due
on
october
2,
1964.
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
the
installment
payments
were
--
this
alone,
in
question,
was
30
months
at
$60.00
a
month.
and
--
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
the
principal
interest.
let
me
correct
myself,
justice
fortas.
the
full
amount
of
the
loan
was
$180.00
and
i
am
looking
at
one
of
the
--
a
copy
of
the
note
in
question.
discount
that
was
charged
was
$322.50
which
is
computed
at
$15.89
per
annum,
simple
interest.
there
was
a
service
fee
of
$9.45.
she
received
$1,468.05.
it
was
the
net
amount
of
the
loan.
now,
justice
white,
in
answer
to
your
query
where
you
mentioned
attachment
and
replevin.
i
would
like
to
state
this,
that
the
attachment
and
replevin
are
set
up
separately
in
the
state
of
wisconsin.
they
are
not
considered
in
the
same
nature
as
a
garnishment
although,
to
a
certain
extent,
they
act
in
the
same
manner,
so
that,
we're
not
too
concerned
with
attachment
and
replevin
here.
in
fact,
as
mr.
--
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
you
don't
put
them
aside,
except
for
this.
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
well,
may
i
clarify
this
for
you,
justice
white?
in
a
matter
of
a
replevin,
this
can
be
started
in
one
of
two
ways.
first
of
all,
you
can
start
the
replevin
by
the
issuance
of
your
summons,
take
it
to
the
sheriff
without
any
seizure,
and
the
matter
is
then
returnable
within
8
to
15
days
after
issuance,
and
it
can
be
heard
by
the
court.
at
that
time,
the
court
can
enter
a
judgment
in
replevin,
as
i
term
it,
in
the
alternative,
either
you
get
the
cash
or
the
merchandise
back.
this
is
used
where
you
have
a
conditional
sales
contract
or
today,
under
the
uniform
code,
a
security
device.
the
other
way
or
the
other
alternative
on
a
replevin
is
that
you
can
issue
the
same
papers
but,
at
the
time
of
issuance
to
the
sheriff,
you
post
a
bond
with
the
sheriff
to
double
the
value
of
the
merchandise
which
you
seek
to
repossess.
the
sheriff,
then,
serves
a
copy
upon
the
debtor
or
defendant
and
leaves
a
copy
of
the
bond
with
him,
takes
the
furniture
in
his
possession,
and
i'm
saying
the
sheriff's
possession,
where
it
is
held,
pending
the
determination
by
the
court.
the
same
type
of
a
remedy
is
true
in
the
attachment.
and
in
these
two
cases,
you
post
a
bond.
this
you
do
not
have
to
do
in
a
garnishment.
a
garnishment
issue
is
forthwith
and
a
levy
is
made
upon
the
employer
who
answers.
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
well,
a
garnishment
would
be
on
a
wages
--
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
bank
accounts,
except
--
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
debts
due,
you
could
but
normally
you
would
attach
--
there's
micro-seizures
are
going
to
attach
on
a
debt
due.
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
garnishee
on
a
bank
account.
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
that's
a
debt
due,
but
i
prefer
an
attachment
on
a
debt
due,
of
course,
depending
upon
the
amount.
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
well,
the
easiest
--
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
you
don't
have
to
put
up
a
bond,
but
--
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
justice
marshall,
let's
carry
it
--
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
it
isn't
$3.50.
now,
this
is
a
misconception
that
the
court
has
been
advised
and
this,
i
assume,
is
because
mr.
greenber
does
not
practice
in
wisconsin.
this
is
also
why
it's
a
fallacy
to
say
that
for
only
$3.00
any
creditor
can
go
and
get
his
money.
the
actual
cost
out
of
pocket
disbursements
on
a
garnishment
of
under
$500.00,
which
is
the
small-claimed
limit
in
the
state
of
wisconsin
is,
$15.20.
in
other
words,
my
client
is
$15.00
--
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice.
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
well,
after
two-and-a
half
--
after
over
two
years
of
attempting
to
get
the
money
with
numerous
letters,
my
client
instructed
me
to
proceed
with
the
garnishment
because,
voluntarily,
mrs.
sniadach
wouldn't
even
bother
to
call
or
come
in.
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
that
is
correct.
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
no,
we're
not
too
concerned
with
the
employer,
quite
frankly.
as
a
practical
situation,
certain
companies,
and
i
will
name
them:
a.o.
smith
corporation,
allis-chalmers
corporation,
harness
fissure,
american
motors,
have
a
policy
of
discharge
after
so
many
garnishments
of
which
we
are
well-aware,
and
we
are
well-aware
of
it
because
the
individual
plants
have
setup
special
personnel
departments
to
work
with
these
employees
so
that,
before
a
garnishment
is
issued,
i
know
as
a
practical
situation
and
as
an
actuality
that
this
matter
has
been
discussed
in
99
out
100
garnishments
with
the
personnel
manager
or
the
party
who's
in
charge,
they
call
him
a
labor
relations
expert
or
an
expediter
and
normally
he
has
said,
“look,
i
can't
do
anything.
i
have
the
men
in
here.
you'll
have
to
garnishee
if
you
want
to
get
your
money."
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
yes,
it
bans
discharge.
now,
how
effective
that
would
be,
mr.
justice
douglas,
i
don't
know.
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
discharge
for
one
debt,
but
the
problem
here
is
that
when,
normally,
you
have
to
resort
to
a
garnishment,
you
have
deepened
a
path
to
the
door,
either
personally,
telephone
calls,
or
letters
in
an
attempt
to
get
a
payment
or
something
on
the
account
rather
than
garnishee
and,
it's
been
my
experience
that
if
you
have
been
doing
this,
god
only
knows
how
many
other
creditors
are
attempting
to
obtain
the
money,
too,
because,
practically,
these
people
don't
only
owe
you,
they
owe
others.
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
the
actual
outweigh
of
cost
is
chargeable
to
the
debtor
or
defendant.
as
a
practical
situation,
if
you
can
get
your
principal
amount
back
most
of
the
banks,
finance
companies,
unlike
your
credit
clothing
or
furniture
companies,
will
be
more
glad
to
take
their
principal
and
waive
interest
and
all
other
charges.
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
taking
this
situation
here,
i
can
state
this.
that,
although
there
is
nothing
in
these
statutes
specifically
calling
for
an
immediate
trial,
that
as
a
practical
situation
in
this
matter,
had
it
not
been
for
the
fact
that
this
was
to
be
a
test
case,
that
this
matter
could
have
been
tried
within
24
to
48
hours
after
the
court
have
been
notified
that
her
check
have
been
tied
up.
the
--
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
on
this
indebtedness?
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
this
action
was
instituted
on
sep
--
on
november
16,
1966,
assuming
that
i
follow
the
minimum
of
eight
days
--
service
within
eight
days
of
the
date
of
issuance,
which
would
mean
that
this
action,
both
the
principal
and
garnishment,
would
be
returnable
in
the
county
court
or
the
small
claim
court
on
the
24th
day
of
november.
now,
the
statute
does
provide
for
an
immediate
trial
on
the
return
date,
and
if
the
situation
is
so
urgent,
as
had
been
indicated
here,
the
matter
could
have
been
tried
on
the
return
day
and
the
court
would
have
handed
down
a
decision
on
that
date.
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
in
theory,
within
30
days
--
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
well,
normally,
if
you're
saying
just
to
start
the
principal
action
and
forget
the
garnishment?
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
normally,
around
30
days.
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
yes,
there
are
exceptions
if
the
--
because
of
illness
of
one
of
the
presiding
judges
where
you
have
to
transfer
calendars
but,
normally,
30
days.
generally,
60
days
is
the
longest,
barring
any
unforn
--
unforeseen
emergency.
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
mr.
chief
justice,
they
do
not.
the
notes
provide
that
an
attorney
fee
can
be
added
on.
there
is
no
provision
for
any
percentage.
the
attorney
fees
are
taxed
by
the
court,
normally
around
$5.00,
depending
upon
the
amount.
in
the
case
of
--
assuming
i'd
recovered
a
judgment
for
$1,800.00,
and
i
would
like
to
state
this
to
the
court,
being
over
$500.00,
if
i
had
sued
for
the
entire
amount,
at
the
time
this
suit
was
instituted,
there
would've
been
two
filing
fees.
so
that,
over
$500.00,
in
addition
to
the
cost
that
i've
mentioned,
there
would
be
a
$15.00-filing
fee
for
each
of
the
actions
on
the
principal
action
and
the
garnishment.
in
order
to
hold
the
court
cost
down,
i
chose
to
bring
an
action
for
back
payments
to
hold
it
under
$500.00.
today,
the
court
has
only
one
filing
fee
for
both
actions.
instead
of
$30.00,
there'd
be
a
$15.00-filing
fee
but,
assuming
that
i
had
instituted
suit
for
the
entire
$1,800.00,
this
is
over
the
small-claim
limit
which
the
maximum
is
$500.
this
probably
would
have
not
reached
trial
or
anywhere
between
six
months
and
a
year.
so,
on
a
large-claim,
we
have
a
different
waiting
period
than
we
do
on
a
small-claim
matter.
but
i
think
the
crux
of
the
question
before
the
court,
as
mr.
greenber
has
indicated,
this
is
a
deprivation
of
the
moneys
of
the
wage
earner,
and
i
would
agree
that
there
is
some
deprivation.
however,
this
is
a
sword
that
is
two-bladed.
you
have
a
party
here
that's
had
this
money
out
for
over
two
years
and
they
have
been
deprived
of
the
use
of
that
money.
i
think
we
are
well-aware
that,
today
in
business,
the
companies
and
the
banks
borrow
from
other
sources
in
which
they
pay
interest.
finance
companies
and
your
other
institutions
also
borrow,
and
they
pay
interest
on
this
money.
we
are
deprived
of
our
money.
the
creditor
sits
back
and
waits.
and
under
the
suggestion
of
mr.
greenber,
by
then,
the
creditor
would
be
the
one
sitting
back
holding
the
bag
and
the
debtor
is
the
one
that's
taking
advantage
of
the
situation
and
has
the
use
of
this
scot-free.
quite
frankly,
with
the
new
consumer
code
coming
in
the
truth
in
lending,
i
don't
know
who's
going
to
be
better
off,
the
creditor
or
the
debtor.
my
own
way
of
thinking,
and
this
is
contrary
to
some
of
the
articles
that
i
have
just
read
in
the
past
few
weeks,
they
are
now
coming
out
saying
that
even
under
the
new
credit
consumer
code,
which
goes
into
effect
july
of
1970,
i
believe,
that
the
creditor
is
still
coming
out
ahead
instead
of
the
debtor.
now,
i've
heard
comments
relative
to
this
and
to
the
truth
in
lending
bill.
i've
gone
over
the
bills.
i
haven't
gone
into
them
thoroughly
but,
to
my
way
of
thinking,
i
still
--
i
feel
that
the
--
today,
under
the
present
passage
of
these
two
bills,
we're
better
off
to
be
a
debtor
than
we
are
a
creditor.
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
then,
i
could've
proc
--
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
i
could
have
proceeded
with
a
garnishment.
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
yes.
in
fact,
let
me
put
it
to
you
this
way.
the
amount
held
is
$31.00
over,
say,
$60.00
actually
being
held.
under
the
wisconsin
statute,
a
single
person
is
given
an
exemption
of
$25.00.
now,
this
is
a
subsistence
allowance
so
that,
if
assuming
that
ms.--
mrs.sniadach,
and
she
was
single
at
that
time
or
she
was
divorced,
let
me
put
it
as
i
recall.
if
she
had
been
single,
she
would've
been
given
the
$25.00.
the
employer
properly
should
have
held
$41.00
and
not
$31.00.
if
she
was
with
dependence,
her
amount
that
would
have
to
be
given
to
her
first
is
$40.00,
so
that
the
employer
should
have
held
$26.00.
i
didn't
check
this.
i
didn't
argue
this.
this
is
the
amount
that
they
answered
when
they
came
in
and
we
let
it
go
with
that.
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
one
garnishment.
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
only
if
you
have
disposed
of
the
previous
garnishment.
in
other
words,
until
about
three
years
ago
when
they
change
the
statute,
it
was
possible
and
there
were
companies
doing
it.
some
of
these
credit
clothing
outfits
were
doing
it,
were
garnishing
every
week
and
tying
up
that
paycheck
before
they
had
even
disposed
of
the
previous
garnishment.
you
can
no
longer
do
this.
if
you
can
put
in
a
garnishment,
you
must
dispose
of
that
matter.
there
must
be
a
release.
there
must
be
an
official
or
judicial
determination.
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
that's
right,
you
can
garnishee.
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
still
have
those
limitations.
the
question
was
brought
up
relative
to
wage
assignments.
we
do
have
a
wage
assignment
law
in
wisconsin.
but
the
wage
assignment
is
limited
to
a
period
of
60
days
and
then,
normally,
the
amount
is
by
agreement
and,
in
the
case
of
these
manufacturing
companies,
the
employment
man
who
is
responsible
for
it
or
is
in
charge
of
working
with
the
employees
will
normally
suggest
the
amount
to
take
off.
he
reviews
the
situation
and
i
have
found,
personally,
that
they
are
more
than
considerate
of
the
needs
of
the
creditor,
as
well
as
the
needs
of
the
employee.
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
no,
i
don't
believe
it
is,
mr.
justice
fortas.
i
believe
that
a
garnishment
is
a
remedy
which
is
afforded
to
the
creditor,
strictly
a
feature
of
the
legislature,
no
question
of
it.
but
it
was
given
to
the
creditor
because
he
had
no
other
remedy,
and
i
think
it
is
more
important
today
than
it
was
15
years
ago
or
20
years
ago.
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
no,
it
only
affects
the
wages
due
as
of
the
date
of
service
of
the
garnishment
papers.
anything
earned
after
that
cannot
be
touched.
it's
strictly
a
one-shot
proposition.
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
i
can
only
levy
--
i
can
institute
a
garnishment
either
with
an
execution
or
without
an
execution
in
the
case
of
a
judgment
of
a
$1,000.00
where
your
garnishment
cost
are
not
$1,520.00,
but
every
time
you
would
issue
a
garnishment,
you
would
have
$30.00
involved
because
you
have
a
filing
fee.
in
such
a
case,
you
would
normally
issue
an
execution
and
then
bring
court
commissioner
proceeding
to
ascertain
if
the
man
has
any
assets
which
can
be
reached.

judgment
debtor.
if
he
has
assets
under
our
statutes
--
mr.

his
wages
--
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
no,
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
compulsory
wage
assignment
in
wisconsin.
it
has
to
be
entirely
voluntarily
and
it
must
be
joined
in
by
the
wife,
if
the
man
is
married
and
has
a
family,
so
that
there
is
adequate
protection.
one
further
statement
relative
to
the
garnishment
that,
although
we
are
not
required
in
wisconsin
to
post
a
bond
at
the
time
of
a
garnishment,
there
is,
under
statute,
a
provision
that
if
there
is
a
wrongful
garnishment,
the
creditor
can
be
sued
for
wrongful
garnishment
and
there
are
actions
that
are
now
pending
and
have
been
tried
and
there
can
be
substantial
damages
for
a
wrongful
garnishment.
so,
i
feel
that
the
protection
is
well
afforded
and
that,
as
mr.
greenber
had
indicated,
there
had
been
five
attempts
or
five
bills
introduced
into
the
legislature
to
change
it.
the
last
change
was
several
years
ago,
limiting
the
garnishment
to
strictly
one
action
before
he
could
start
another
and
there
must
be
a
judgment
at
that
time.
thank
you.
mr.

as
to
--
mr.
sheldon
d.
frank
if
you
have
a
judgment
over
$200.00,
the
judgment
can
be
docketed,
as
we
term
it,
and
it
then
automatically
becomes
a
lien
against
a
property,
which
is
only
good
if
the
equity
in
the
property
exceeds
the
$10,000
maximum.
there
is
a
$10,000
homestead
exemption.

close

as
to
