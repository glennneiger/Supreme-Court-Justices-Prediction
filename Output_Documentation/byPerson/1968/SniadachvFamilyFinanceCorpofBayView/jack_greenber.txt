mr.
jack
greenber
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
review
a
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
wisconsin,
two
justices
dissenting,
upholding
that
state's
prejudgment
garnishment
statutory
scheme.
the
case
involves,
we
would
like
to
emphasize
at
the
outset,
prejudgment
garnishment,
that
is,
the
seizure
of
wages
own
--
owed
by
an
employer
to
petitioner,
or
--
who
was
his
employee,
at
the
outset
of
legal
action
without
a
rule
by
a
judge
or
a
jury,
not
after
judgment
when
judge
and
jury
have
ruled
upon
this,
to
collect
moneys,
a
judge
to
be
owed
the
validity
of
which
prediction
will
ultimately
be
determined
in
an
action
to
follow
in
which
the
merits
of
a
claim
will
be
tried.petitioner
was
a
$65.00
a
week
wage
earner
and
the
amount
garnished
under
the
statute
was
$31.59
or
half
of
$63.18
which
was
one
week's
paycheck,
the
money
owed
to
her
for
the
period
in
question.
mr.
jack
greenber
one
pay
period.
in
her
case,
the
pay
period
was
a
week.
it
might
be
a
month
if
the
pay
period
is
a
month,
but
it's
one
week.
mr.
jack
greenber
that's
right.
mr.
jack
greenber
that's
right.
it
cannot
be
done
again
in
this
action.
it
could
be
done
again
in
another
action.
mr.
jack
greenber
after
the
termination
of
the
principal
action.
mr.
jack
greenber
that's
correct.
mr.
jack
greenber
that's
correct
and
indeed,
the
employer
pays
her
a
subsistence
allowance
which
in
this
case,
was
also
$31.59.
mr.
jack
greenber
she
gets
all
$65.00.
mr.
jack
greenber
may
not.
so,
the
remaining
$31.59,
as
indicated,
was
paid
to
her
as
a
subsistence
allowance
in
according
to
wisconsin
law.
the
wages
were
withheld
merely
upon
the
filing
of
a
complaint
in
garnishment
of
the
petitioner's
employer
which
alleged
only
three
things
as
required
by
statute.
these
are
mere
allegations,
but
petitioner
was
indebted
to
respondent
by
virtue
of
an
alleged
contract
that
the
amount
due
was
$420.00
and
that
petitioner's
employer
owed
her
wages.
and
on
pages
3
and
7
of
the
record,
the
--
all
that
had
to
be
alleged
is
set
forth.
i'll
just
read
an
extract,
that
the
complaint
and
garnishment
served
on
the
employer
and
said,
"you
are
hereby
--"
summons
rather,
"you
are
hereby
ordered
to
retain
such
property
pending
the
further
order
of
the
court
and
in
case
of
your
failure
to
do
so,
judgment
will
be
rendered
against
you
for
the
amount
of
plaintiff's
judgment
against
said
defendant,"
which
would
be
the
whole
$420,
“and
cost
of
which
the
said
defendant
will
take
notice.”
the
employer
responded
in
the
answer
of
the
garnishee
saying
that
he
did,
indeed,
have
money
in
his
control
and
his
possession
of
control
belonging
to
christine
sniadach
in
the
sum
of
$63.18
and,
further,
that
garnishee
will
pay
from
that
amount,
$31.59
as
a
subsistence
allowance
and
will
hold
the
balance
of
$31.59
for
the
further
order
of
the
court.
mr.
jack
greenber
not
on
this
issue,
mr.
justice
douglas.
first,
the
act
is
not
yet
operative
and,
secondly,
the
act
merely
says
you
may
not
--
mr.
jack
greenber
you
may
not
be
discharged
for
one
garnishment
and
it
limits
the
amount
of
pay
to
be
garnished
to
25%.
it
doesn't
affect
the
notice
in
hearing.
it
doesn't
address
itself
to
that
issue.
mr.
jack
greenber
that's
correct.
it's
limited
to
25%.
then
there
are
some
rulings
by
the
secretary
of
labor
which
may
be
pertinent,
which
had
not
yet
been
made,
but
it
would
not
address
itself
to
those
in
hearings.
mr.
jack
greenber
25%
of
--
mr.
jack
greenber
25%
disposable
income.
mr.
jack
greenber
yes,
but
they
can
only
take
25%
of
the
$65.00,
assuming
all
65.
mr.
jack
greenber
i
think
for
the
--
mr.
jack
greenber
up
to
the
amount
--
mr.
jack
greenber
well,
our
position
--
mr.
jack
greenber
our
position
would
go
that
far
as
to
an
entirely
domestic
situation.
as
to
a
foreign
attachment,
we
think
that
involves
other
considerations
and
indeed,
in
our
brief,
we
do
take
the
position
that,
if
it
were
necessary
to
obtain
jurisdiction
over
a
foreign
resident,
that
might
be
in
different
situation.
mr.
jack
greenber
well,
i
frankly
would
have
some
considerable
--
ownbey
against
morgan
never
left
me
feeling
very
comfortable,
mr.
justice
white.
but
in
any
event,
it's
so
different
a
situation
and
he
rested
upon
such
other
indifferent
considerations.
mr.
jack
greenber
i
would
say
so,
and
--
but
the
justification
given
in
ownbey,
that
of
the
great
antiquity
of
foreign
attachment
as
giving
some
substance
to
--
that
it's
valid
under
the
due
process
clause,
i
think
some
weight
has
to
be
given
to
that.
there
is
no
great
antiquity
to
prejudgment
wage
garnishment.
it's
around
the
turn
of
the
century
and,
as
i
said,
ownbey
does
not
leave
me
feeling
very
good,
but
i
don't
think
that
has
to
be
reached
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
jack
greenber
approximately
20.
mr.
jack
greenber
pardon
me?
mr.
jack
greenber
they
vary
somewhat
as
to
amount
and
as
to
procedure,
but
approximately
20
states
have
prejudgment
garnishment
in
one
form
or
another.
mr.
jack
greenber
without
notice,
yes,
sir.
mr.
jack
greenber
no,
it
does
not.
mr.
jack
greenber
i
wouldn't
think
so.
the
essence
of
our
case
is
there
has
not
been
any
notice
and
hearing
on
the
principal
claim.
post-judgment
by
definition
is
another
case
where,
indeed,
there
has
been
notice
and
hearing
and
it's
really
a
method
of
collection
in
a
fully
adjudicated
claim.
i
might
find
it
difficult
to
think
of
reading
this
kind
of
claim
in
a
post-judgment
case.
mr.
jack
greenber
well,
then
you'd
have
other
types
of
due
process
--
mr.
jack
greenber
if
it
were
default
judgment,
but
you
would
have
that
as
to
perhaps
any
default
judgment
even
without
regard
to
--
mr.
jack
greenber
there
are,
i
think,
precisely
17
and
wisconsin
limits
it
to
one
pay
period
by
a
recent
amendment.
mr.
jack
greenber
the
other
states
have
it
rather
--
it
is
a
continuous
garnishment
until
--
mr.
jack
greenber
well,
the
one
pay
period
was
put
in
by
a
recent
amendment
a
number
of
years
ago
after,
i
think,
the
injustice
of
the
law
became
so
manifested.
it
was
put
in
as
some
sort
of
ameliorative
measure.
i
might
say
that
our
opponent
makes,
and
this
court
below,
makes
some
reference
to
pending
legislation.
however,
that
legislation
has
been
defeated
in
the
last
five
sessions
of
the
legislature
and
there's,
as
far
as
i
can
tell,
no
reason
to
believe
it's
going
to
pass.
mr.
jack
greenber
the
one
with
limiting
--
mr.
jack
greenber
on
the
contrary,
they
do
not
limit
it.
mr.
jack
greenber
well,
that
is
but,
as
i
said,
that
was
put
in
by
an
amendment
a
few
years
ago.
mr.
jack
greenber
it's
--
yes,
that
possibly
would
be
involved.
mr.
jack
greenber
prejudgment,
yes.
mr.
jack
greenber
i
believe
that
it
is.
the
garnishment
statute
is
in
a
general
section
of
the
law
called
attachment
and
it
refers
to
a
variety
of
attachments,
and
it
is
not
merely
limited
to
wage
garnishment.
wage
garnishment
is
a
species
of
garnishment.
mr.
jack
greenber
absent
special
circumstances
--
mr.
jack
greenber
such
as
absconding
debtors,
foreign
residence,
and
perhaps
some
special
circumstances,
that
one
might
not
think
of
at
the
moment
but
some
good
reason
that
this
seems
to
have
no
basis
and
reason,
and
also
denies
notice
and
hearing.
now,
this
was
justified
by
the
court
below
on
two
grounds,
as
far
as
we
can
tell.
the
first
ground
is
that,
indeed,
the
property
was
not
taken.
it
was
the
$35
--
$31.19
--
the
$31.59.
it
was
taken
only
temporarily,
and
the
second
is
a
reliance
upon
authority,
essentially,
the
only
line
of
cases
in
--
cases
cited
in
the
opinion
which
are
also
discussed
in
our
brief.
our
position
on
the
assertion
that
this
indeed
not
a
deprivation
of
property
and
not
a
taking
is
that
we
just,
i
have
to
say,
we
just
--
that's
just
a
manipulation
of
words.
that's
not
the
case.
the
taking
of
property
is,
indeed,
the
taking
of
property.
in
some
sense,
it's
measurable
by
the
interest
on
$31.59,
but
i
don't
think
$65-a
week
wager
really
cares
about
the
interest.
it's
a
question
of
what
someone
of
those
means,
what
$31.59
means
in
terms
of
food,
budget,
rent
or
whatever.
it
is
a
substantial
deprivation
to
someone
who's
earning
that
kind
of
money
to
be
place
under
the
hammer
of
that
kind
of
a
threat
and
the
possibility
of
loss
of
employment,
possibility
of
impairment
of
means
of
livelihood
for
self
and
family
and
it
is
indeed
a
very
substantial
taking
of
looking
in
proportion
of
the
circumstances
of
the
individual.
so
far
as
the
cases
are
concerned,
i
believe
i've
implicitly
covered
our
position
with
regard
to
those
cases
in
response
to
questions.
those
cases
involve
special
circumstances
such
as
foreign
attachment,
the
obtaining
of
jurisdiction,
the
commencement
of
an
in
rem
proceeding
or
something
of
the
sort.
mr.
jack
greenber
no,
mr.
justice
harlan,
except
that
it
has
been
suggested
in
the
opinion
below
and
that
a
collateral
proceeding
of
some
sort
might
be
started.
i
might
say,
first
of
all,
i
think
that's
rather
illusory
for
someone
in
this
kind
of
an
income
bracket
but,
as
the
dissenting
opinion
of
justice
heffernon
points
out
and
as
a
reading
of
those
two
cases
points
out,
that
collateral
proceeding
is,
for
all
practical
purposes,
limited
to
the
face
of
the
complaint
in
garnishment.
as
for
example,
the
complaint
in
garnishment
did
not
say
that
case
was
in
contract
tort
or
on
a
judgment,
but
it
does
not
become
an
examination
of
the
validity
of
the
underlying
debt,
which
would
be
the
real
issue,
and
indeed
the
entire
statutory
scheme
is
focused
in
the
other
direction.
the
entire
statutory
scheme
says
you
may
not
try
the
principal
act,
the
garnishment
action,
until
after
the
principal
action
is
concluded.
so,
there
is
neither
a
practical
nor
a
legal
way
that
that
can
be
gone
into.
mr.
jack
greenber
absent
special
circumstances
that
we're
talking
about,
i
would
say.
absent
foreign
--
mr.
jack
greenber
yes,
that
would
be
our
position.
mr.
jack
greenber
well,
if
there
were
a
preliminary
hearing
procedure,
and
i
don't
know
of
existence
of
any
such
procedure
anywhere,
it
would
have
to
be
a
procedure
which
would,
indeed,
accord
due
process
rights
and
it
would
be
--
it'd
have
to
be
a
procedure
in
which
the
defendant,
the
principal
defendant,
would
have
some
opportunity,
some
substantial
opportunity
both
in
law
and
practically
with
adequate
time,
and
so
forth,
to
contest
the
validity
of
the
underlying
claim.
i
would
say
that
should
be
so
substantial,
it
would
really
ought
to
amount
to
the
action
in
chief
you
--
mr.
jack
greenber
i
would
say
not
because,
in
this
particular
case,
while
it's
not
a
matter
of
the
record,
there
has
been
some
talking
about
it
in
the
briefs.
she
would
have
a
defense
that
she
signed
the
note
induced
by
representations
made
to
her
which
were
not
true.
now,
i
don't
really
know
what
the
legal
validity
of
her
position
in
that
would
be
and
that
would
not
be
anything
to
be
contested
here,
but
i
would
say
that
a
due
process
hearing
ought
to
give
her
sufficiently
substantial
opportunity
to
make
or
take
whatever
position
she
has
with
regard
to
the
validity
of
the
underlying
claim.
so
much
so,
that
it
would
be
duplicative
of
the
principal
action.
at
least
it
ought
to
be
pretty
close
to
it.
there
are
at
least
something
of
the
dignity
of
summary
judgment
proceeding
which
we
have
in
the
federal
court,
for
example.
mr.
jack
greenber
then,
i
would
--
if
there
were
some
substantial
evidence
of
special
circumstances
such
as
absconding,
which
i
believe
is
suggested
by
the
form
of
your
question,
i
would
say,
yes,
but
that's
one
of
the
--
there's
nothing
like
that
in
this
case
and
the
garnishment
laws
are
not
addressed
to
that.
some
of
the
foreign
garnishment,
foreign
attachment
laws
are
and
i
imagine
there
are
proceedings
which
can
impound
money
or
funds
if
somebody's
threatening
to
get
on
the
plane
to
brazil,
but
that's
not
what
we
have
here.
i
would
certainly
feel
it
would
be
justifiable.
mr.
jack
greenber
well,
i
would
say
in
any
type
of
property
owned
by
an
alleged
debtor,
concerning
which
there's
a
threat
of
leaving
the
jurisdictions,
running
away
with
the
money,
or
something
like
that
is
a
different
kind
of
case
than
the
one
we're
talking
about
here.
mr.
jack
greenber
absent
special
circumstances.
mr.
jack
greenber
yes,
absent
special
circumstances,
but
i
don't
see
how
you
could
distinguish
the
large
one
from
the
small
one,
except
that
there
are
special
circumstances
if
someone
is
threatening
to
take
the
money
away
from
the
jurisdiction
the
power
of
the
court.
but
that's
not
here
and
i
think
we
make
rather
clear
in
our
brief
that
we
would
think
that
would
be
another
kind
of
a
case.
mr.
jack
greenber
i'm
not
sure
whether
it
does
or
not,
mr.
justice
fortas.
our
position
would
be
the
same
with
regard
to
wage
assignments
if
they
occurred
pursuant
to
a
statute.
mr.
jack
greenber
they
would
be
different,
yes.
they
would
be
different,
but
if
it
occurred
pursuant
to
a
statute,
our
position
would
be
the
same.
if
it
occurred
pursuant
to
a
common
law
scheme,
that
would
then
involve
other
questions.
mr.
jack
greenber
the
man
who
garnishes
the
funds
to
make
a
bond?
mr.
jack
greenber
it
does
--
no,
it
does
not.
you
mean,
the
plaintiff
in
the
case?
mr.
jack
greenber
no,
it
does
not.
mr.
jack
greenber
this
one
does
not.
mr.
jack
greenber
this
one
does
not.
mr.
jack
greenber
in
some,
our
position
i
think
has
been
stated
as
to
the
due
process
claim.
a
prejudgment
garnishment
surely
cannot
be
called
a
principal
problem
of
the
poor
and
the
disaffected
in
the
country,
but
it's,
indeed,
a
sufficient
injustice
that
works
considerable
harm.
indeed,
it's
astonishing
how
widely
recognized
this
is
by
the
court
below
and
by
our
opponents,
and
it's
perhaps
no
accident
that
such
a
gulling
procedure
flies
squarely
in
the
face
of
one
of
our
most
fundamental
constitutional
guarantees.
those
portions
of
our
constitution
designed
to
assure
fair
procedure
and
equality,
i
think,
evidenced
a
genius
for
expressing
some
of
the
basic
sense
of
justice
of
man.
and
to
strike
down
prejudgment
garnishment
as
unconstitutional
will
hardly
solve
all
the
problems
of
the
poor
and
the
disadvantaged,
but
it
would
be
the
right
and
constitutional
thing
to
do
and
we
submit
it
would
make
a
difference.
mr.
jack
greenber
may
i'd
like
to
add
just
a
word
or
two.
there's
been
some
bit
of
going
outside
the
record
on
the
nature
of
this
debt
and
i
don't
know
that
it's
important
that
it
could
be
asserted
that
these
are
the
facts
and
they'd
be
considered
as
a
hypothetical
situation,
if
the
court
likes.
indeed,
it
would
be
asserted
that
she
had
a
defense
here,
that
the
defense
was
inducement
of
her
signature
by
fraud,
that
her
husband
was
in
jail,
that
she
subsequently
was
divorced
from
him,
and
it
was
a
defense
of
a
sort
which
would
take
some
--
perhaps
some
considerable
development
of
evidence
and
discovery
in
order
to
present
it
properly
to
the
court,
adequately
to
the
court.
this
leads
me
to
mr.
justice
white's
inquiry
about
what
will
be
a
proper
standard
for
a
prejudgment
garnishment
if
some
sort
of
hearing
or
procedure
were
to
be
established.
it
certainly
should
be
a
standard,
if
one
were
adopted,
which
would
adequately
enable
development
of
whatever
defense,
the
party,
the
defendant
in
the
principal
action
might
have
which
would
involve,
in
cases
of
this
sort,
sometimes
a
considerable
discovery
because
many
of
the
facts
are
principally
within
the
possession
of
the
creditor.
usually,
the
note
is
in
documents
and
so
forth,
particularly
for
people
who
deal
with
small-loan
companies
of
this
sort.
there
was
a
mention
of
the
uniform
consumer
credit
code
that
has
not
been
adopted
in
wisconsin.
my
information
is
that
it
has
been
adopted
only
in
the
state
of
utah.
we
submit
that
the
judgment
below
should
be
reversed
for
the
reasons
given.
mr.
jack
greenber
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
review
a
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
wisconsin,
two
justices
dissenting,
upholding
that
state's
prejudgment
garnishment
statutory
scheme.
the
case
involves,
we
would
like
to
emphasize
at
the
outset,
prejudgment
garnishment,
that
is,
the
seizure
of
wages
own
--
owed
by
an
employer
to
petitioner,
or
--
who
was
his
employee,
at
the
outset
of
legal
action
without
a
rule
by
a
judge
or
a
jury,
not
after
judgment
when
judge
and
jury
have
ruled
upon
this,
to
collect
moneys,
a
judge
to
be
owed
the
validity
of
which
prediction
will
ultimately
be
determined
in
an
action
to
follow
in
which
the
merits
of
a
claim
will
be
tried.petitioner
was
a
$65.00
a
week
wage
earner
and
the
amount
garnished
under
the
statute
was
$31.59
or
half
of
$63.18
which
was
one
week's
paycheck,
the
money
owed
to
her
for
the
period
in
question.
mr.
jack
greenber
one
pay
period.
in
her
case,
the
pay
period
was
a
week.
it
might
be
a
month
if
the
pay
period
is
a
month,
but
it's
one
week.
mr.
jack
greenber
that's
right.
mr.
jack
greenber
that's
right.
it
cannot
be
done
again
in
this
action.
it
could
be
done
again
in
another
action.
mr.
jack
greenber
after
the
termination
of
the
principal
action.
mr.
jack
greenber
that's
correct.
mr.
jack
greenber
that's
correct
and
indeed,
the
employer
pays
her
a
subsistence
allowance
which
in
this
case,
was
also
$31.59.
mr.
jack
greenber
she
gets
all
$65.00.
mr.
jack
greenber
may
not.
so,
the
remaining
$31.59,
as
indicated,
was
paid
to
her
as
a
subsistence
allowance
in
according
to
wisconsin
law.
the
wages
were
withheld
merely
upon
the
filing
of
a
complaint
in
garnishment
of
the
petitioner's
employer
which
alleged
only
three
things
as
required
by
statute.
these
are
mere
allegations,
but
petitioner
was
indebted
to
respondent
by
virtue
of
an
alleged
contract
that
the
amount
due
was
$420.00
and
that
petitioner's
employer
owed
her
wages.
and
on
pages
3
and
7
of
the
record,
the
--
all
that
had
to
be
alleged
is
set
forth.
i'll
just
read
an
extract,
that
the
complaint
and
garnishment
served
on
the
employer
and
said,
"you
are
hereby
--"
summons
rather,
"you
are
hereby
ordered
to
retain
such
property
pending
the
further
order
of
the
court
and
in
case
of
your
failure
to
do
so,
judgment
will
be
rendered
against
you
for
the
amount
of
plaintiff's
judgment
against
said
defendant,"
which
would
be
the
whole
$420,
“and
cost
of
which
the
said
defendant
will
take
notice.”
the
employer
responded
in
the
answer
of
the
garnishee
saying
that
he
did,
indeed,
have
money
in
his
control
and
his
possession
of
control
belonging
to
christine
sniadach
in
the
sum
of
$63.18
and,
further,
that
garnishee
will
pay
from
that
amount,
$31.59
as
a
subsistence
allowance
and
will
hold
the
balance
of
$31.59
for
the
further
order
of
the
court.
mr.
jack
greenber
not
on
this
issue,
mr.
justice
douglas.
first,
the
act
is
not
yet
operative
and,
secondly,
the
act
merely
says
you
may
not
--
mr.
jack
greenber
you
may
not
be
discharged
for
one
garnishment
and
it
limits
the
amount
of
pay
to
be
garnished
to
25%.
it
doesn't
affect
the
notice
in
hearing.
it
doesn't
address
itself
to
that
issue.
mr.
jack
greenber
that's
correct.
it's
limited
to
25%.
then
there
are
some
rulings
by
the
secretary
of
labor
which
may
be
pertinent,
which
had
not
yet
been
made,
but
it
would
not
address
itself
to
those
in
hearings.
mr.
jack
greenber
25%
of
--
mr.
jack
greenber
25%
disposable
income.
mr.
jack
greenber
yes,
but
they
can
only
take
25%
of
the
$65.00,
assuming
all
65.
mr.
jack
greenber
i
think
for
the
--
mr.
jack
greenber
up
to
the
amount
--
mr.
jack
greenber
well,
our
position
--
mr.
jack
greenber
our
position
would
go
that
far
as
to
an
entirely
domestic
situation.
as
to
a
foreign
attachment,
we
think
that
involves
other
considerations
and
indeed,
in
our
brief,
we
do
take
the
position
that,
if
it
were
necessary
to
obtain
jurisdiction
over
a
foreign
resident,
that
might
be
in
different
situation.
mr.
jack
greenber
well,
i
frankly
would
have
some
considerable
--
ownbey
against
morgan
never
left
me
feeling
very
comfortable,
mr.
justice
white.
but
in
any
event,
it's
so
different
a
situation
and
he
rested
upon
such
other
indifferent
considerations.
mr.
jack
greenber
i
would
say
so,
and
--
but
the
justification
given
in
ownbey,
that
of
the
great
antiquity
of
foreign
attachment
as
giving
some
substance
to
--
that
it's
valid
under
the
due
process
clause,
i
think
some
weight
has
to
be
given
to
that.
there
is
no
great
antiquity
to
prejudgment
wage
garnishment.
it's
around
the
turn
of
the
century
and,
as
i
said,
ownbey
does
not
leave
me
feeling
very
good,
but
i
don't
think
that
has
to
be
reached
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
jack
greenber
approximately
20.
mr.
jack
greenber
pardon
me?
mr.
jack
greenber
they
vary
somewhat
as
to
amount
and
as
to
procedure,
but
approximately
20
states
have
prejudgment
garnishment
in
one
form
or
another.
mr.
jack
greenber
without
notice,
yes,
sir.
mr.
jack
greenber
no,
it
does
not.
mr.
jack
greenber
i
wouldn't
think
so.
the
essence
of
our
case
is
there
has
not
been
any
notice
and
hearing
on
the
principal
claim.
post-judgment
by
definition
is
another
case
where,
indeed,
there
has
been
notice
and
hearing
and
it's
really
a
method
of
collection
in
a
fully
adjudicated
claim.
i
might
find
it
difficult
to
think
of
reading
this
kind
of
claim
in
a
post-judgment
case.
mr.
jack
greenber
well,
then
you'd
have
other
types
of
due
process
--
mr.
jack
greenber
if
it
were
default
judgment,
but
you
would
have
that
as
to
perhaps
any
default
judgment
even
without
regard
to
--
mr.
jack
greenber
there
are,
i
think,
precisely
17
and
wisconsin
limits
it
to
one
pay
period
by
a
recent
amendment.
mr.
jack
greenber
the
other
states
have
it
rather
--
it
is
a
continuous
garnishment
until
--
mr.
jack
greenber
well,
the
one
pay
period
was
put
in
by
a
recent
amendment
a
number
of
years
ago
after,
i
think,
the
injustice
of
the
law
became
so
manifested.
it
was
put
in
as
some
sort
of
ameliorative
measure.
i
might
say
that
our
opponent
makes,
and
this
court
below,
makes
some
reference
to
pending
legislation.
however,
that
legislation
has
been
defeated
in
the
last
five
sessions
of
the
legislature
and
there's,
as
far
as
i
can
tell,
no
reason
to
believe
it's
going
to
pass.
mr.
jack
greenber
the
one
with
limiting
--
mr.
jack
greenber
on
the
contrary,
they
do
not
limit
it.
mr.
jack
greenber
well,
that
is
but,
as
i
said,
that
was
put
in
by
an
amendment
a
few
years
ago.
mr.
jack
greenber
it's
--
yes,
that
possibly
would
be
involved.
mr.
jack
greenber
prejudgment,
yes.
mr.
jack
greenber
i
believe
that
it
is.
the
garnishment
statute
is
in
a
general
section
of
the
law
called
attachment
and
it
refers
to
a
variety
of
attachments,
and
it
is
not
merely
limited
to
wage
garnishment.
wage
garnishment
is
a
species
of
garnishment.
mr.
jack
greenber
absent
special
circumstances
--
mr.
jack
greenber
such
as
absconding
debtors,
foreign
residence,
and
perhaps
some
special
circumstances,
that
one
might
not
think
of
at
the
moment
but
some
good
reason
that
this
seems
to
have
no
basis
and
reason,
and
also
denies
notice
and
hearing.
now,
this
was
justified
by
the
court
below
on
two
grounds,
as
far
as
we
can
tell.
the
first
ground
is
that,
indeed,
the
property
was
not
taken.
it
was
the
$35
--
$31.19
--
the
$31.59.
it
was
taken
only
temporarily,
and
the
second
is
a
reliance
upon
authority,
essentially,
the
only
line
of
cases
in
--
cases
cited
in
the
opinion
which
are
also
discussed
in
our
brief.
our
position
on
the
assertion
that
this
indeed
not
a
deprivation
of
property
and
not
a
taking
is
that
we
just,
i
have
to
say,
we
just
--
that's
just
a
manipulation
of
words.
that's
not
the
case.
the
taking
of
property
is,
indeed,
the
taking
of
property.
in
some
sense,
it's
measurable
by
the
interest
on
$31.59,
but
i
don't
think
$65-a
week
wager
really
cares
about
the
interest.
it's
a
question
of
what
someone
of
those
means,
what
$31.59
means
in
terms
of
food,
budget,
rent
or
whatever.
it
is
a
substantial
deprivation
to
someone
who's
earning
that
kind
of
money
to
be
place
under
the
hammer
of
that
kind
of
a
threat
and
the
possibility
of
loss
of
employment,
possibility
of
impairment
of
means
of
livelihood
for
self
and
family
and
it
is
indeed
a
very
substantial
taking
of
looking
in
proportion
of
the
circumstances
of
the
individual.
so
far
as
the
cases
are
concerned,
i
believe
i've
implicitly
covered
our
position
with
regard
to
those
cases
in
response
to
questions.
those
cases
involve
special
circumstances
such
as
foreign
attachment,
the
obtaining
of
jurisdiction,
the
commencement
of
an
in
rem
proceeding
or
something
of
the
sort.
mr.
jack
greenber
no,
mr.
justice
harlan,
except
that
it
has
been
suggested
in
the
opinion
below
and
that
a
collateral
proceeding
of
some
sort
might
be
started.
i
might
say,
first
of
all,
i
think
that's
rather
illusory
for
someone
in
this
kind
of
an
income
bracket
but,
as
the
dissenting
opinion
of
justice
heffernon
points
out
and
as
a
reading
of
those
two
cases
points
out,
that
collateral
proceeding
is,
for
all
practical
purposes,
limited
to
the
face
of
the
complaint
in
garnishment.
as
for
example,
the
complaint
in
garnishment
did
not
say
that
case
was
in
contract
tort
or
on
a
judgment,
but
it
does
not
become
an
examination
of
the
validity
of
the
underlying
debt,
which
would
be
the
real
issue,
and
indeed
the
entire
statutory
scheme
is
focused
in
the
other
direction.
the
entire
statutory
scheme
says
you
may
not
try
the
principal
act,
the
garnishment
action,
until
after
the
principal
action
is
concluded.
so,
there
is
neither
a
practical
nor
a
legal
way
that
that
can
be
gone
into.
mr.
jack
greenber
absent
special
circumstances
that
we're
talking
about,
i
would
say.
absent
foreign
--
mr.
jack
greenber
yes,
that
would
be
our
position.
mr.
jack
greenber
well,
if
there
were
a
preliminary
hearing
procedure,
and
i
don't
know
of
existence
of
any
such
procedure
anywhere,
it
would
have
to
be
a
procedure
which
would,
indeed,
accord
due
process
rights
and
it
would
be
--
it'd
have
to
be
a
procedure
in
which
the
defendant,
the
principal
defendant,
would
have
some
opportunity,
some
substantial
opportunity
both
in
law
and
practically
with
adequate
time,
and
so
forth,
to
contest
the
validity
of
the
underlying
claim.
i
would
say
that
should
be
so
substantial,
it
would
really
ought
to
amount
to
the
action
in
chief
you
--
mr.
jack
greenber
i
would
say
not
because,
in
this
particular
case,
while
it's
not
a
matter
of
the
record,
there
has
been
some
talking
about
it
in
the
briefs.
she
would
have
a
defense
that
she
signed
the
note
induced
by
representations
made
to
her
which
were
not
true.
now,
i
don't
really
know
what
the
legal
validity
of
her
position
in
that
would
be
and
that
would
not
be
anything
to
be
contested
here,
but
i
would
say
that
a
due
process
hearing
ought
to
give
her
sufficiently
substantial
opportunity
to
make
or
take
whatever
position
she
has
with
regard
to
the
validity
of
the
underlying
claim.
so
much
so,
that
it
would
be
duplicative
of
the
principal
action.
at
least
it
ought
to
be
pretty
close
to
it.
there
are
at
least
something
of
the
dignity
of
summary
judgment
proceeding
which
we
have
in
the
federal
court,
for
example.
mr.
jack
greenber
then,
i
would
--
if
there
were
some
substantial
evidence
of
special
circumstances
such
as
absconding,
which
i
believe
is
suggested
by
the
form
of
your
question,
i
would
say,
yes,
but
that's
one
of
the
--
there's
nothing
like
that
in
this
case
and
the
garnishment
laws
are
not
addressed
to
that.
some
of
the
foreign
garnishment,
foreign
attachment
laws
are
and
i
imagine
there
are
proceedings
which
can
impound
money
or
funds
if
somebody's
threatening
to
get
on
the
plane
to
brazil,
but
that's
not
what
we
have
here.
i
would
certainly
feel
it
would
be
justifiable.
mr.
jack
greenber
well,
i
would
say
in
any
type
of
property
owned
by
an
alleged
debtor,
concerning
which
there's
a
threat
of
leaving
the
jurisdictions,
running
away
with
the
money,
or
something
like
that
is
a
different
kind
of
case
than
the
one
we're
talking
about
here.
mr.
jack
greenber
absent
special
circumstances.
mr.
jack
greenber
yes,
absent
special
circumstances,
but
i
don't
see
how
you
could
distinguish
the
large
one
from
the
small
one,
except
that
there
are
special
circumstances
if
someone
is
threatening
to
take
the
money
away
from
the
jurisdiction
the
power
of
the
court.
but
that's
not
here
and
i
think
we
make
rather
clear
in
our
brief
that
we
would
think
that
would
be
another
kind
of
a
case.
mr.
jack
greenber
i'm
not
sure
whether
it
does
or
not,
mr.
justice
fortas.
our
position
would
be
the
same
with
regard
to
wage
assignments
if
they
occurred
pursuant
to
a
statute.
mr.
jack
greenber
they
would
be
different,
yes.
they
would
be
different,
but
if
it
occurred
pursuant
to
a
statute,
our
position
would
be
the
same.
if
it
occurred
pursuant
to
a
common
law
scheme,
that
would
then
involve
other
questions.
mr.
jack
greenber
the
man
who
garnishes
the
funds
to
make
a
bond?
mr.
jack
greenber
it
does
--
no,
it
does
not.
you
mean,
the
plaintiff
in
the
case?
mr.
jack
greenber
no,
it
does
not.
mr.
jack
greenber
this
one
does
not.
mr.
jack
greenber
this
one
does
not.
mr.
jack
greenber
in
some,
our
position
i
think
has
been
stated
as
to
the
due
process
claim.
a
prejudgment
garnishment
surely
cannot
be
called
a
principal
problem
of
the
poor
and
the
disaffected
in
the
country,
but
it's,
indeed,
a
sufficient
injustice
that
works
considerable
harm.
indeed,
it's
astonishing
how
widely
recognized
this
is
by
the
court
below
and
by
our
opponents,
and
it's
perhaps
no
accident
that
such
a
gulling
procedure
flies
squarely
in
the
face
of
one
of
our
most
fundamental
constitutional
guarantees.
those
portions
of
our
constitution
designed
to
assure
fair
procedure
and
equality,
i
think,
evidenced
a
genius
for
expressing
some
of
the
basic
sense
of
justice
of
man.
and
to
strike
down
prejudgment
garnishment
as
unconstitutional
will
hardly
solve
all
the
problems
of
the
poor
and
the
disadvantaged,
but
it
would
be
the
right
and
constitutional
thing
to
do
and
we
submit
it
would
make
a
difference.
mr.
jack
greenber
may
i'd
like
to
add
just
a
word
or
two.
there's
been
some
bit
of
going
outside
the
record
on
the
nature
of
this
debt
and
i
don't
know
that
it's
important
that
it
could
be
asserted
that
these
are
the
facts
and
they'd
be
considered
as
a
hypothetical
situation,
if
the
court
likes.
indeed,
it
would
be
asserted
that
she
had
a
defense
here,
that
the
defense
was
inducement
of
her
signature
by
fraud,
that
her
husband
was
in
jail,
that
she
subsequently
was
divorced
from
him,
and
it
was
a
defense
of
a
sort
which
would
take
some
--
perhaps
some
considerable
development
of
evidence
and
discovery
in
order
to
present
it
properly
to
the
court,
adequately
to
the
court.
this
leads
me
to
mr.
justice
white's
inquiry
about
what
will
be
a
proper
standard
for
a
prejudgment
garnishment
if
some
sort
of
hearing
or
procedure
were
to
be
established.
it
certainly
should
be
a
standard,
if
one
were
adopted,
which
would
adequately
enable
development
of
whatever
defense,
the
party,
the
defendant
in
the
principal
action
might
have
which
would
involve,
in
cases
of
this
sort,
sometimes
a
considerable
discovery
because
many
of
the
facts
are
principally
within
the
possession
of
the
creditor.
usually,
the
note
is
in
documents
and
so
forth,
particularly
for
people
who
deal
with
small-loan
companies
of
this
sort.
there
was
a
mention
of
the
uniform
consumer
credit
code
that
has
not
been
adopted
in
wisconsin.
my
information
is
that
it
has
been
adopted
only
in
the
state
of
utah.
we
submit
that
the
judgment
below
should
be
reversed
for
the
reasons
given.
