when
was
the
petition
for
habeas
corpus
filed
with
relation
to
that
second
lineup?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
suppose
you
could
--you
could
tell
me
what
date
the
lineup
was
on
and
what
date
the
petitioner
was
filed
detention.
chief
justice
earl
warren
wouldn't
this
language
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
indicate
that
they
did
challenge
a
proper
cause
for
arrest
that
says,
it
is
urged
that
if
a
direction
of
the
statute
had
followed
the
magistrate
would
have
been
required
to
release
the
defendants
for
lack
of
probable
cause
to
retain
defendant
in
jail.
it
is
pointed
out
that
the
evidence
against
the
defendant
was
procured
at
the
jail
subsequent
to
time
at
which
the
appellant
would
have
been
released
that
he
had
been
released
if
he
had
been
taken
before
a
magistrate.
i
would
not
indicate
that
it
was
raised
in
that
court?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
understood
you
to
say
that
it
was
not
raised
except
in
the
trial
court,
that's
all
