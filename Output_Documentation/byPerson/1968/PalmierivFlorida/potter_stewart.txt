justice
potter
stewart
are
you
--
is
it
your
contention
that
he
was
arrested
without
probable
cause?
justice
potter
stewart
does
the
record
show
what
--
justice
potter
stewart
by
what
information
the
arresting
officers
have
at
the
time
he
was
arrested,
the
time
they
arrested
him?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's
not
my
question.
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
in
reading
the
briefs
and
without
calling
them
that
the
record
did
show
that
he
was
arrested
only
after
the
victim
of
the
holdup
had
identified
his
picture
--
as
the
picture
of
the
man
who
had
held
him
up.
justice
potter
stewart
not
in
term
of
argument,
i'm
talking
about
the
facts.
justice
potter
stewart
this
is
not
the
part
of
your
submission.
however,
as
i
understand
that
this
arrest
was
made
without
any
probable
cause,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
of
a
--
you
do
not
affirmatively
claim
that
this
was
an
illegal
arrest.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
goldman.
justice
potter
stewart
even
if
the
court
shall
accept
completely
your
submission
that
the
mcnabb-mallory
rule
should
become
a
constitutional
rule
that
would
not
automatically
when
your
case
for
you
would
it
because
your
theory,
it's
necessary
to
go
one
step
beyond
that
mcnabb
and
mallory
themselves
involved
the
admission
of
statements
made
by
a
man
in
custody
before
he
was
in
custody
if
he
was
not
probably
before
a
magistrate
within
the
reasonable
time.
justice
potter
stewart
are
there
any
federal
cases
--
justice
potter
stewart
would
that
be
under
(inaudible)?
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
that's
what
i
understand
you
to
say
on
page
10
of
your
brief?
justice
potter
stewart
further
the
victim
picked
out
the
petitioner's
picture
prior
to
arrest.
justice
potter
stewart
the
record
simply
doesn't
show
any
--
am
i
right
in
my
understanding
that
in
no
time,
has
there
been
any
plain
that
the
arrest
was
illegal?
justice
potter
stewart
so,
for
that
reason
there
was
no
canvassing
of
the
issue
as
to
what
probable
cause
there
might
have
been
or
other
than
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
by
with
respect
to
the
knowledge
of
arresting
officer.
justice
potter
stewart
how
does
the
fact,
there's
a
lot
of
facts
in
the
lineup
to
get
into
the
evidence
of
thought?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i'm
trying
to
get
a
--
were
the
facts
in
the
lineup,
what
are
the
direct
examination
or
cross
exam?
justice

is
that
the
point
raise
in
those
parts?
