mr.
howard
mendelow
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
wish
to
apologize
to
mr.
justice
stewart
if
at
any
time
in
reading
the
factual
defamation
by
the
state
in
its
brief
has
come
to
the
conclusion
at
the
state
of
florida
meant
to
say
that
the
photographs
shown
to
the
victim
in
this
case
were
identified
by
him
as
the
petitioner.
if
we
did
say
that,
we
apologize.
mr.
howard
mendelow
we
did,
sir.
mr.
howard
mendelow
yes,
sir.
we
did
say
that
and
we
wish
to
apologize
to
the
court
at
this
time
for
that
statement.
mr.
howard
mendelow
the
fact
is
that
he
did
pick
out
a
picture
and
that
is
the
extent
of
the
record,
your
honor
but
we
feel
in
our
argument
we
have
so
stated
that
the
court
--
mr.
howard
mendelow
a
picture
but
it
does
not
designate
that
he
picked
out
a
picture
of
the
petitioner
in
this
matter.
mr.
howard
mendelow
we
do
not
know
sir.
mr.
howard
mendelow
the
record
is
not
clear
and
it
does
not
--
mr.
howard
mendelow
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
stewart
and
in
no
time
was
it
raised
on
direct
appeal
and
at
no
time
was
it
raised
on
petitioner
--
on
the
certified
question
accommodating
the
petitioner
for
writ
of
certiorari
in
the
florida
supreme
court.
mr.
howard
mendelow
other
than
what
is
reflected
in
the
record
per
se.
mr.
howard
mendelow
other
than
what
is
reflected
in
the
record
per
se.
and
we
submit
that
from
this
record,
it
can
be
gleamed
that
there
was
sufficient
probable
cause
to
make
an
arrest.
in
particular
--
mr.
howard
mendelow
(voice
overlap)
he
was
charged
--
mr.
howard
mendelow
--
the
record
does
not
reflect
any
charge
but
we
would
assume
--
mr.
howard
mendelow
yes,
there
is
your
honor.
mr.
howard
mendelow
by
reasonable
inference,
a
petitioner
--
mr.
howard
mendelow
no,
sir.
mr.
howard
mendelow
we
would
assume
he
was
arrested
and
booked
for
a
charge
but
it
does
not
reflect
in
the
record,
it
does
reflect
in
the
record
that
he
was
arrested.
mr.
howard
mendelow
no
sir,
i
would
assume
not.
mr.
howard
mendelow
i
would
think
it
would,
your
honor.
mr.
howard
mendelow
not
specifically
per
se
in
the
record.
mr.
howard
mendelow
the
fact
that
he
was
arrested
and
25
hours
after
his
arrest
a
lineup
was
held
and
the
victim
of
the
particular
robbery
that
he
was
arrested
for
came
in
and
picked
him
out
of
six-man
lineup.
mr.
howard
mendelow
mr.
justice
marshall,
there
were
two
lineups
held
in
this
case.
the
first
lineup
was
a
six-man
lineup
held
25
hours
after
the
arrest
of
the
petitioner.
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
that
depicts
exactly
how
many
short
man
or
tall
man
or
fat
man
or
skinny
man
where
in
this
lineup.
this
record
is
completely
void
of
any
reference
to
the
description
of
any
of
the
particular
six-man
in
this
particular
lineup.
there
was
a
subsequent
lineup
held
six
days
later
in
which
the
son
of
the
victim
appeared
to
the
police
headquarters
and
picked
the
petitioner
out
of
the
lineup
consisting
of
five
men
of
which
the
record
reflects
that
he
picked
out
the
shortest
man
in
the
lineup.
the
record
does
also
not
reflect
that
they
were
--that
the
various
sizes
between
the
men
in
the
lineup
just
that
he
picked
up
the
shortest,
he
picked
up
a
man
5'6”
that
could
be
man
with
5'6-1/2”,
5'7”,
5'7-1/2”,
and
a
5'8”
in
the
lineup
but
the
record
does
not
reflect
that
sir.
mr.
howard
mendelow
the
ultimate
charge
was
placed
against
him
10
days
after
his
initial
arrest.
mr.
howard
mendelow
eight
days.
mr.
howard
mendelow
eight
days,
your
honor
but
a
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
was
filed.
it
does
not
reflect
exactly
one
of
this
file.
but
some
time
during
this
10-day
period,
a
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
was
filed
by
petitioner
through
counsel.
at
which
time,
subsequent
to
that
and
at
10
days
the
information
was
filed
by
the
state
in
this
course.
mr.
howard
mendelow
correct
sir,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
howard
mendelow
that
is
correct.
mr.
howard
mendelow
they're
still
is
in
as
far
as
state
of
florida
is
concerned.
we
feel
that
the
record
reflects
sufficient
probable
cause
for
the
arrest
and
the
initial
detention.
mr.
howard
mendelow
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
howard
mendelow
that
is
correct.
mr.
howard
mendelow
the
record
does
not
reflect
that,
your
honor.
i
don't
know
it
was
somewhere
in
between
--
mr.
howard
mendelow
no,
because
it
hasn't
been
made
in
exhibit
or
part
of
the
exhibit
in
this
file.
the
initial
lineup
was
held
on
march
2nd,
six
days
subsequent
to
that,
the
second
lineup
was
held.
on
march
10th,
the
affirmation
was
filed.
some
time
during
that
period,
a
petition
for
habeas
corpus
was
filed
petitioner's
counsel.
and
that
is
the
only
thing
that
i
can
safely
say
the
record
reflects.
i
wish
to
also
take
issue
with
one
fact
that
has
been
insisted
upon
by
petitioner.
and
that
is
the
sole
evidence
--the
sole
evidence
that
petitioner's
conviction
was
based
upon
was
the
identification
that
occurred
at
the
lineup.
the
record
is
replete
that
an,
in-court
identification
was
made
by
both
the
victim
loy
dill
and
the
witness
loy
dill,
jr.
his
son
from
the
activity
or
the
incident
or
the
crime,
the
actual
robbery
that
occurred
some
time
previous
to
his
arrest.
the
testimony
concerning
the
lineup
was
merely
corroboration
to
that
identification.
further,
this
is
fortified
by
the
fact
that
both
instances
when
the
identification
was
made
by
the
victim
and
his
son,
they
noticed
the
difference
in
the
petitioner's
appearance
from
the
time
they
saw
him
at
the
you
(inaudible)
store,
the
grocery
store
that
was
robbed
and
his
appearance
in
court.
and
not
also
related
back
to
the
incident
and
not
to
the
lineup.
they
noticed
that
in
both
cases
that
he
was
heavier,
he
appeared
heavier.
further
--
mr.
howard
mendelow
the
first
witness
called
by
the
state
was
the
victim
loy
dill.
he
testified
as
to
the
events
that
occurred
at
the
robbery.
he
also,
being
a
former
military
policeman,
testified
that
when
the
police
arrived
at
the
(inaudible)
store
after
the
robbery,
he
gave
a
detailed
and
i
mean
detailed
description
of
the
robber
describing
his
height,
weight,
even
so
far
at
describing
his
complexion
which
he
described
his
pimply
with
acne
complexion
to
the
police
officers.
this
identification
was
then
made
in
court
based
on
that
description
and
based
upon
seeing
the
petitioner
in
court.
mr.
howard
mendelow
they
were
--initially,
they
were
brought
out
on
direct
examination
and
then
they
were
brought
out
on
cross-examination.
but
they
were
brought
out,
we
submit
on
direct
examination
merely
for
corroboration
and
not
for
the
primary
identification
of
the
petitioner
on
this
matter.
mr.
howard
mendelow
i
will
submit
mr.
justice
fortas
that
nothing
other
than
two
lineups
--
mr.
howard
mendelow
that's
correct.
mr.
howard
mendelow
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
and
the
record
in
fact
and
the
appendix
which
is
before
the
court
that
indicates
any
question
of
any
way
manner
or
form,
nor
was
petitioner's
conviction
based
upon
any
inculpatory
statements
or
exculpatory
statements
or
any
admission
or
any
statement
whatsoever
made
by
him
while
in
custody.
mr.
howard
mendelow
that
is
correct.
and
i
would
like
to
adjust
myself
a
little
later
in
my
argument
concerning
the
violation
or
the
technical
violation
of
florida
statute
901.23
--
mr.
howard
mendelow
basically,
you
are
correct,
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
will
try
to
refine
that
a
little
bit
in
the
cause
of
my
argument
finally.
mr.
howard
mendelow
petitioner
contends
or
asks
this
court
to
extend
the
mcnabb-mallory
rule
and
make
it
applicable
to
the
states
and
also
make
it
applicable
to
confessions.
we
submit
that
this
would
be
a
double
extension
--
mr.
howard
mendelow
excuse
me,
make
it
applicable
to
the
lineup,
i'm
sorry.
we
submit
that
this
would
be
a
double
extension
of
a
rule
that
was
initially
promulgated
by
congress
as
federal
rule
of
criminal
procedure
and
treated
by
this
court
in
its
supervisory
powers
of
the
--over
the
federal
courts
and
the
criminal
procedure
requirements
of
federal
prosecutions.
the
rule
as
effectuated
by
the
cases
of
mcnabb
versus
united
states
and
mallory
versus
united
states
make
it
clear
that
its
prime
purpose
was
to
alleviate
the
evils
arising
out
of
secret
interrogation,
secret
interrogation.
nowhere,
in
any
of
the
cases
that
i
have
been
able
to
research
decided
by
this
court
has
the
rule
been
used
other
than
in
any
confession
cases.
nowhere,
have
i
been
able
to
determine
that
this
rule
has
ever
been
made
applicable
to
the
states
in
fact,
this
court
many
times
and
in
many
cases
has
stated
that
this
is
a
rule
of
the
federal
criminal
procedure
and
it
is
not
applicable
to
the
states.
further,
we
say
that
the
void
was
--
there
was
a
void
that
is
created
by
not
making
this
rule
applicable
to
the
states
has
been
filled
--
the
breach
has
been
filled
by
decisions
of
this
court
whereby
the
rights
--
the
constitutional
rights
of
the
accused
have
been
looked
after
and
made
applicable
to
the
state
prosecutions
and
has
protected
the
accused
in
every
stage
that
would
be
applicable
to
this
case
and
we
cite
to
the
court
starting
with
ash
craft
versus
tennessee
which
this
court
stated
that,
a
detention
in
a
confession
case
inherently
dangerous
in
a
confession
case.
then
we
have
the
mapp
case
which
protects
the
accused
in
illegal
search
and
seizure
cases
if
the
--
even
if
the
illegal
search
and
seizure
occurred
during
the
detention.
we
have
the
wong
sun
case
where
if
there
is
a
primary
illegality
and
the
taint
has
not
been
purged
than
any
evidence
secured
as
a
result
of
that
primary
illegality
is
excludable.
we
have
the
escobedo,
messiah,
miranda
cases
which
certainly
afford
an
accused
the
protections
of
the
fifth
and
sixth
amendments
to
united
states
constitution
in
confession
cases.
we
have
weighed
gilbert,
stovall
that
are
particularly
applicable
to
this
case
where
the
only
evidence
secured
is
that
of
the
identification
by
lineup
and
both
petitioner
and
the
respondent
do
agree
that
the
right
to
counsel,
their
lineups
is
here
today
and
it
has
been
here
since
june
12,
1967
but
that
ruling
in
the
stovall
decision
makes
it
only
prospective
and
not
retroactive.
mr.
howard
mendelow
no
case
to
my
knowledge
has
ever
been
decided
on
the
cases
--
mr.
howard
mendelow
your
honor,
the
supreme
court
of
florida
has
consistently
held
that
a
preliminary
hearing
is
not
a
critical
stage
in
a
criminal
prosecution
case
and
may
i
explain
why.
the
florida
criminal
procedure
statute
which
requires
an
accused
who
was
arrested
without
warrant
to
be
taken
before
a
committing
magistrate
without
unnecessary
delay.
that
preliminary
hearing
resulting
from
that
statute
would
only
be
a
preliminary
hearing
according
to
our
statute
to
decide
probable
cause
of
the
charges.
mr.
howard
mendelow
i've
assumed
that
that's
what
the
magistrate
would
do
when
the
accused
just
presented
before
and
i'm
only
reading
the
literal
or
interpreting
the
literal
expression
of
the
statute.
but
i
would
assume
that
a
magistrate
who
hasn't
accused
be
brought
before
him
would
advice
him
of
his
right
to
bail,
his
right
to
counsel,
his
right
that
anything
he
might
say
may
be
used
against
him,
and
the
fact
that
he
doesn't
have
to
say
anything.
mr.
howard
mendelow
i
don't
believe
the
record
reflects
that.
mr.
howard
mendelow
he
was
held
pursuant
to
a
lawful
arrest.
and
that's
all
i
can
say
to
this
court
and
that's
all
that
the
record,
i
feel
that
the
record
reflects.
mr.
howard
mendelow
mr.
justice
marshall,
you
asked
me
the
question
a
little
while
ago
and
i'm
afraid
that
i
didn't
have
the
answer
to
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
can
only
assume
from
the
record
that
he
was
booked
for
the
crime
for
which
he
was
ultimately
tried.
mr.
howard
mendelow
well,
the
only
way
i
can
bring
this
clear
to
the
court,
i
do
not
know
but
the
only
way
i
can
infer
from
the
record
is
that
25
hours
after
his
arrest,
he
was
placed
in
a
lineup
and
the
victim
of
this
particular
robbery
that
he
was
arrested
for
was
called
down
to
identify
someone
--
mr.
howard
mendelow
yes,
there
are.
mr.
howard
mendelow
i
just
don't
know
the
answer
for
it
mr.
justice
fortas.
all
i
know
is
that
under
--
almost
every
circumstance,
this
case
–
this
particular
statute
has
not
been
held
to
be
a
critical
part.
now,
the
circumstances
that
were
--
it
would
be
a
critical
part,
in
my
understanding
this
is
where
out
of
preliminary
hearing,
the
accused
has
pled
guilty.
and
then
had
withdrawn
his
pleas
of
guilty
prior
to
trial
and
that
evidence
was
sought
to
be
introduced
against
him,
the
guilty
plea
at
the
preliminary
hearing
and
that
the
florida's
supreme
court
has
said,
this
was
critical.
but
as
far
as
the
time
or
the
amount
of
time
after
arrest
and
before
arraignment
to
my
knowledge
or
at
least
at
this
time
i
cannot
say
to
you
a
case
which
would
say
how
much
time
would
be
allowable.
now
the
reason
why
the
--
mr.
howard
mendelow
yes,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
howard
mendelow
yes,
it
was
before
the
trial
court.
mr.
howard
mendelow
yes,
it
was,
your
honor.
mr.
howard
mendelow
down
to
direct
appeal.
mr.
howard
mendelow
that's
correct
because
it
wasn't
presented.
mr.
howard
mendelow
not
to
my
knowledge.
mr.
howard
mendelow
the
point
raised
in
the
district
court
was
the
detention
and
sufficiency.
and
the
certified
question
was
to
the
florida
supreme
court
was
merely
on
the
detention
aspect
of
the
case.
mr.
howard
mendelow
no,
because
there
are
many,
many
circumstances
why
a
magistrate
would
say
there'd
be
no
probable
cause.
however,
i
would
like
to
discuss
with
the
court,
the
factor
that
even
if
the
petitioner
was
brought
before
a
committing
magistrate
and
he
was
released
by
this
committing
magistrate
under
the
florida
procedure
and
under
a
procedure
approved
by
this
court
in
beck
versus
washington.
the
assistant
or
the
state
attorney's
office
or
the
state
prosecuting
official
in
florida
would
still
bring
judges,
bring
former
charges
against
the
petitioner.
mr.
howard
mendelow
no,
as
i
say,
i
don't
know
what
would
happen
at
the
preliminary
hearing
but
suppose
additional
evidence
was
brought
in.
even
on
the
same
evidence,
i
would
make
that
statement.
they
could
be
arrested
on
the
capias
issued
by
the
criminal
court
of
--
mr.
howard
mendelow
we
could
arrest
him,
yes
sir
on
a
capias
issued
by
the
state
attorney's
office
after
he
had
been
discharged
by
the
committing
magistrate.
further,
counsel
for
petitioner
has
stated
that
there
was
no
probable
cause
and
surely
the
committing
magistrate
would
have
released
the
petitioner.
i
say
and
this
is
a
point
that
i
think
it
is
very
important
under
due
process
argument.
let
us
suppose
that
after
the
petitioner
was
arrested,
he
was
brought
before
the
committing
magistrate
and
this
victim
who
had
given
such
a
clear
and
precise
description
to
the
arrest
to
the
officers
in
the
case
had
appeared
at
the
preliminary
hearing
and
had
pointed
to
the
petitioner
and
said,
“yes,
this
is
the
man
that
robbed
me.”
now
we
ask
the
court,
which
would
be
more
susceptible
to
suggestive
identification
that
one
on
one
confrontation
before
the
magistrate
or
the
procedure
that
was
used
in
the
instant
case
where
the
victim
had
to
point
the
particular
petitioner
out
of
the
six-man
lineup?
we
feel
that
due
process
was
not
violated
here
by
requiring
the
petitioner
to
stand
in
a
six-man
lineup
25
hours
after
his
arrest.
mr.
howard
mendelow
it
was
raised
in
that
court
the
same
as
it
was
raised
here,
your
honor,
and
in
the
supreme
court
of
florida
on
the
basis
that
speculatively
the
petitioner
would
have
been
released.
that's
pure
speculation
and
nothing
more.
mr.
howard
mendelow
the
actual
illegal
--
the
lawful
as
so
as
the
illegality
of
the
arrest
per
se
was
not
raised
except
in
the
trial
court.
we
submit
respectfully
so
that
the
petitioner
was
not
prejudiced
in
any
way
in
a
manner
or
reform
but
is
not
being
taken
before
a
committing
magistrate
immediately
after
his
arrest.
one,
because
the
probable
cause
necessarily
for
his
arrest
still
existed
and
he
could
have
been
charged
and
rearrested
by
the
state
prosecuting
officials.
and
number
two,
a
prosecution
could
have
been
forthcoming
based
on
that
information.
and
number
three,
his
conviction
and
this
perhaps
is
the
most
important
aspect
of
the
case.
his
conviction
was
not
based
on
the
lineup
identification
solely.
his
conviction
was
based
on
the
in-court
identification.
independent
of
any
lineup
identification
that
was
subsequently
made
after
his
arrest
and
that
is
clear
from
the
record.
so
therefore,
if
his
prosecution
was
not
dependent
upon
the
lineup,
and
his
conviction
was
not
dependent
on
the
lineup,
how
can
we
say
that
the
petitioner
was
prejudiced
by
not
being
brought
before
a
committing
magistrate?
there
is
just
now
casual
connection
between
prosecution
or
the
conviction
and
is
not
being
brought
before
a
committing
magistrate
in
the
opinion
of
the
respondent
on
this
matter.
therefore,
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
mcnabb-mallory
rule
to
be
extended
to
the
states
under
this
factual
circumstance
and
situation
would
be
a
double
extension
and
not
necessarily
call
for
by
factual
situation
in
this
case.
further,
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
petitioner's
conviction
was
not
in
any
way
based
upon
his
not
being
brought
before
committing
magistrate.
we
respectfully
ask
this
court
to
affirm
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
florida
in
this
cause.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
howard
mendelow
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
wish
to
apologize
to
mr.
justice
stewart
if
at
any
time
in
reading
the
factual
defamation
by
the
state
in
its
brief
has
come
to
the
conclusion
at
the
state
of
florida
meant
to
say
that
the
photographs
shown
to
the
victim
in
this
case
were
identified
by
him
as
the
petitioner.
if
we
did
say
that,
we
apologize.
mr.
howard
mendelow
we
did,
sir.
mr.
howard
mendelow
yes,
sir.
we
did
say
that
and
we
wish
to
apologize
to
the
court
at
this
time
for
that
statement.
mr.
howard
mendelow
the
fact
is
that
he
did
pick
out
a
picture
and
that
is
the
extent
of
the
record,
your
honor
but
we
feel
in
our
argument
we
have
so
stated
that
the
court
--
mr.
howard
mendelow
a
picture
but
it
does
not
designate
that
he
picked
out
a
picture
of
the
petitioner
in
this
matter.
mr.
howard
mendelow
we
do
not
know
sir.
mr.
howard
mendelow
the
record
is
not
clear
and
it
does
not
--
mr.
howard
mendelow
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
stewart
and
in
no
time
was
it
raised
on
direct
appeal
and
at
no
time
was
it
raised
on
petitioner
--
on
the
certified
question
accommodating
the
petitioner
for
writ
of
certiorari
in
the
florida
supreme
court.
mr.
howard
mendelow
other
than
what
is
reflected
in
the
record
per
se.
mr.
howard
mendelow
other
than
what
is
reflected
in
the
record
per
se.
and
we
submit
that
from
this
record,
it
can
be
gleamed
that
there
was
sufficient
probable
cause
to
make
an
arrest.
in
particular
--
mr.
howard
mendelow
(voice
overlap)
he
was
charged
--
mr.
howard
mendelow
--
the
record
does
not
reflect
any
charge
but
we
would
assume
--
mr.
howard
mendelow
yes,
there
is
your
honor.
mr.
howard
mendelow
by
reasonable
inference,
a
petitioner
--
mr.
howard
mendelow
no,
sir.
mr.
howard
mendelow
we
would
assume
he
was
arrested
and
booked
for
a
charge
but
it
does
not
reflect
in
the
record,
it
does
reflect
in
the
record
that
he
was
arrested.
mr.
howard
mendelow
no
sir,
i
would
assume
not.
mr.
howard
mendelow
i
would
think
it
would,
your
honor.
mr.
howard
mendelow
not
specifically
per
se
in
the
record.
mr.
howard
mendelow
the
fact
that
he
was
arrested
and
25
hours
after
his
arrest
a
lineup
was
held
and
the
victim
of
the
particular
robbery
that
he
was
arrested
for
came
in
and
picked
him
out
of
six-man
lineup.
mr.
howard
mendelow
mr.
justice
marshall,
there
were
two
lineups
held
in
this
case.
the
first
lineup
was
a
six-man
lineup
held
25
hours
after
the
arrest
of
the
petitioner.
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
that
depicts
exactly
how
many
short
man
or
tall
man
or
fat
man
or
skinny
man
where
in
this
lineup.
this
record
is
completely
void
of
any
reference
to
the
description
of
any
of
the
particular
six-man
in
this
particular
lineup.
there
was
a
subsequent
lineup
held
six
days
later
in
which
the
son
of
the
victim
appeared
to
the
police
headquarters
and
picked
the
petitioner
out
of
the
lineup
consisting
of
five
men
of
which
the
record
reflects
that
he
picked
out
the
shortest
man
in
the
lineup.
the
record
does
also
not
reflect
that
they
were
--that
the
various
sizes
between
the
men
in
the
lineup
just
that
he
picked
up
the
shortest,
he
picked
up
a
man
5'6”
that
could
be
man
with
5'6-1/2”,
5'7”,
5'7-1/2”,
and
a
5'8”
in
the
lineup
but
the
record
does
not
reflect
that
sir.
mr.
howard
mendelow
the
ultimate
charge
was
placed
against
him
10
days
after
his
initial
arrest.
mr.
howard
mendelow
eight
days.
mr.
howard
mendelow
eight
days,
your
honor
but
a
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
was
filed.
it
does
not
reflect
exactly
one
of
this
file.
but
some
time
during
this
10-day
period,
a
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
was
filed
by
petitioner
through
counsel.
at
which
time,
subsequent
to
that
and
at
10
days
the
information
was
filed
by
the
state
in
this
course.
mr.
howard
mendelow
correct
sir,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
howard
mendelow
that
is
correct.
mr.
howard
mendelow
they're
still
is
in
as
far
as
state
of
florida
is
concerned.
we
feel
that
the
record
reflects
sufficient
probable
cause
for
the
arrest
and
the
initial
detention.
mr.
howard
mendelow
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
howard
mendelow
that
is
correct.
mr.
howard
mendelow
the
record
does
not
reflect
that,
your
honor.
i
don't
know
it
was
somewhere
in
between
--
mr.
howard
mendelow
no,
because
it
hasn't
been
made
in
exhibit
or
part
of
the
exhibit
in
this
file.
the
initial
lineup
was
held
on
march
2nd,
six
days
subsequent
to
that,
the
second
lineup
was
held.
on
march
10th,
the
affirmation
was
filed.
some
time
during
that
period,
a
petition
for
habeas
corpus
was
filed
petitioner's
counsel.
and
that
is
the
only
thing
that
i
can
safely
say
the
record
reflects.
i
wish
to
also
take
issue
with
one
fact
that
has
been
insisted
upon
by
petitioner.
and
that
is
the
sole
evidence
--the
sole
evidence
that
petitioner's
conviction
was
based
upon
was
the
identification
that
occurred
at
the
lineup.
the
record
is
replete
that
an,
in-court
identification
was
made
by
both
the
victim
loy
dill
and
the
witness
loy
dill,
jr.
his
son
from
the
activity
or
the
incident
or
the
crime,
the
actual
robbery
that
occurred
some
time
previous
to
his
arrest.
the
testimony
concerning
the
lineup
was
merely
corroboration
to
that
identification.
further,
this
is
fortified
by
the
fact
that
both
instances
when
the
identification
was
made
by
the
victim
and
his
son,
they
noticed
the
difference
in
the
petitioner's
appearance
from
the
time
they
saw
him
at
the
you
(inaudible)
store,
the
grocery
store
that
was
robbed
and
his
appearance
in
court.
and
not
also
related
back
to
the
incident
and
not
to
the
lineup.
they
noticed
that
in
both
cases
that
he
was
heavier,
he
appeared
heavier.
further
--
mr.
howard
mendelow
the
first
witness
called
by
the
state
was
the
victim
loy
dill.
he
testified
as
to
the
events
that
occurred
at
the
robbery.
he
also,
being
a
former
military
policeman,
testified
that
when
the
police
arrived
at
the
(inaudible)
store
after
the
robbery,
he
gave
a
detailed
and
i
mean
detailed
description
of
the
robber
describing
his
height,
weight,
even
so
far
at
describing
his
complexion
which
he
described
his
pimply
with
acne
complexion
to
the
police
officers.
this
identification
was
then
made
in
court
based
on
that
description
and
based
upon
seeing
the
petitioner
in
court.
mr.
howard
mendelow
they
were
--initially,
they
were
brought
out
on
direct
examination
and
then
they
were
brought
out
on
cross-examination.
but
they
were
brought
out,
we
submit
on
direct
examination
merely
for
corroboration
and
not
for
the
primary
identification
of
the
petitioner
on
this
matter.
mr.
howard
mendelow
i
will
submit
mr.
justice
fortas
that
nothing
other
than
two
lineups
--
mr.
howard
mendelow
that's
correct.
mr.
howard
mendelow
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
and
the
record
in
fact
and
the
appendix
which
is
before
the
court
that
indicates
any
question
of
any
way
manner
or
form,
nor
was
petitioner's
conviction
based
upon
any
inculpatory
statements
or
exculpatory
statements
or
any
admission
or
any
statement
whatsoever
made
by
him
while
in
custody.
mr.
howard
mendelow
that
is
correct.
and
i
would
like
to
adjust
myself
a
little
later
in
my
argument
concerning
the
violation
or
the
technical
violation
of
florida
statute
901.23
--
mr.
howard
mendelow
basically,
you
are
correct,
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
will
try
to
refine
that
a
little
bit
in
the
cause
of
my
argument
finally.
mr.
howard
mendelow
petitioner
contends
or
asks
this
court
to
extend
the
mcnabb-mallory
rule
and
make
it
applicable
to
the
states
and
also
make
it
applicable
to
confessions.
we
submit
that
this
would
be
a
double
extension
--
mr.
howard
mendelow
excuse
me,
make
it
applicable
to
the
lineup,
i'm
sorry.
we
submit
that
this
would
be
a
double
extension
of
a
rule
that
was
initially
promulgated
by
congress
as
federal
rule
of
criminal
procedure
and
treated
by
this
court
in
its
supervisory
powers
of
the
--over
the
federal
courts
and
the
criminal
procedure
requirements
of
federal
prosecutions.
the
rule
as
effectuated
by
the
cases
of
mcnabb
versus
united
states
and
mallory
versus
united
states
make
it
clear
that
its
prime
purpose
was
to
alleviate
the
evils
arising
out
of
secret
interrogation,
secret
interrogation.
nowhere,
in
any
of
the
cases
that
i
have
been
able
to
research
decided
by
this
court
has
the
rule
been
used
other
than
in
any
confession
cases.
nowhere,
have
i
been
able
to
determine
that
this
rule
has
ever
been
made
applicable
to
the
states
in
fact,
this
court
many
times
and
in
many
cases
has
stated
that
this
is
a
rule
of
the
federal
criminal
procedure
and
it
is
not
applicable
to
the
states.
further,
we
say
that
the
void
was
--
there
was
a
void
that
is
created
by
not
making
this
rule
applicable
to
the
states
has
been
filled
--
the
breach
has
been
filled
by
decisions
of
this
court
whereby
the
rights
--
the
constitutional
rights
of
the
accused
have
been
looked
after
and
made
applicable
to
the
state
prosecutions
and
has
protected
the
accused
in
every
stage
that
would
be
applicable
to
this
case
and
we
cite
to
the
court
starting
with
ash
craft
versus
tennessee
which
this
court
stated
that,
a
detention
in
a
confession
case
inherently
dangerous
in
a
confession
case.
then
we
have
the
mapp
case
which
protects
the
accused
in
illegal
search
and
seizure
cases
if
the
--
even
if
the
illegal
search
and
seizure
occurred
during
the
detention.
we
have
the
wong
sun
case
where
if
there
is
a
primary
illegality
and
the
taint
has
not
been
purged
than
any
evidence
secured
as
a
result
of
that
primary
illegality
is
excludable.
we
have
the
escobedo,
messiah,
miranda
cases
which
certainly
afford
an
accused
the
protections
of
the
fifth
and
sixth
amendments
to
united
states
constitution
in
confession
cases.
we
have
weighed
gilbert,
stovall
that
are
particularly
applicable
to
this
case
where
the
only
evidence
secured
is
that
of
the
identification
by
lineup
and
both
petitioner
and
the
respondent
do
agree
that
the
right
to
counsel,
their
lineups
is
here
today
and
it
has
been
here
since
june
12,
1967
but
that
ruling
in
the
stovall
decision
makes
it
only
prospective
and
not
retroactive.
mr.
howard
mendelow
no
case
to
my
knowledge
has
ever
been
decided
on
the
cases
--
mr.
howard
mendelow
your
honor,
the
supreme
court
of
florida
has
consistently
held
that
a
preliminary
hearing
is
not
a
critical
stage
in
a
criminal
prosecution
case
and
may
i
explain
why.
the
florida
criminal
procedure
statute
which
requires
an
accused
who
was
arrested
without
warrant
to
be
taken
before
a
committing
magistrate
without
unnecessary
delay.
that
preliminary
hearing
resulting
from
that
statute
would
only
be
a
preliminary
hearing
according
to
our
statute
to
decide
probable
cause
of
the
charges.
mr.
howard
mendelow
i've
assumed
that
that's
what
the
magistrate
would
do
when
the
accused
just
presented
before
and
i'm
only
reading
the
literal
or
interpreting
the
literal
expression
of
the
statute.
but
i
would
assume
that
a
magistrate
who
hasn't
accused
be
brought
before
him
would
advice
him
of
his
right
to
bail,
his
right
to
counsel,
his
right
that
anything
he
might
say
may
be
used
against
him,
and
the
fact
that
he
doesn't
have
to
say
anything.
mr.
howard
mendelow
i
don't
believe
the
record
reflects
that.
mr.
howard
mendelow
he
was
held
pursuant
to
a
lawful
arrest.
and
that's
all
i
can
say
to
this
court
and
that's
all
that
the
record,
i
feel
that
the
record
reflects.
mr.
howard
mendelow
mr.
justice
marshall,
you
asked
me
the
question
a
little
while
ago
and
i'm
afraid
that
i
didn't
have
the
answer
to
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
can
only
assume
from
the
record
that
he
was
booked
for
the
crime
for
which
he
was
ultimately
tried.
mr.
howard
mendelow
well,
the
only
way
i
can
bring
this
clear
to
the
court,
i
do
not
know
but
the
only
way
i
can
infer
from
the
record
is
that
25
hours
after
his
arrest,
he
was
placed
in
a
lineup
and
the
victim
of
this
particular
robbery
that
he
was
arrested
for
was
called
down
to
identify
someone
--
mr.
howard
mendelow
yes,
there
are.
mr.
howard
mendelow
i
just
don't
know
the
answer
for
it
mr.
justice
fortas.
all
i
know
is
that
under
--
almost
every
circumstance,
this
case
–
this
particular
statute
has
not
been
held
to
be
a
critical
part.
now,
the
circumstances
that
were
--
it
would
be
a
critical
part,
in
my
understanding
this
is
where
out
of
preliminary
hearing,
the
accused
has
pled
guilty.
and
then
had
withdrawn
his
pleas
of
guilty
prior
to
trial
and
that
evidence
was
sought
to
be
introduced
against
him,
the
guilty
plea
at
the
preliminary
hearing
and
that
the
florida's
supreme
court
has
said,
this
was
critical.
but
as
far
as
the
time
or
the
amount
of
time
after
arrest
and
before
arraignment
to
my
knowledge
or
at
least
at
this
time
i
cannot
say
to
you
a
case
which
would
say
how
much
time
would
be
allowable.
now
the
reason
why
the
--
mr.
howard
mendelow
yes,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
howard
mendelow
yes,
it
was
before
the
trial
court.
mr.
howard
mendelow
yes,
it
was,
your
honor.
mr.
howard
mendelow
down
to
direct
appeal.
mr.
howard
mendelow
that's
correct
because
it
wasn't
presented.
mr.
howard
mendelow
not
to
my
knowledge.
mr.
howard
mendelow
the
point
raised
in
the
district
court
was
the
detention
and
sufficiency.
and
the
certified
question
was
to
the
florida
supreme
court
was
merely
on
the
detention
aspect
of
the
case.
mr.
howard
mendelow
no,
because
there
are
many,
many
circumstances
why
a
magistrate
would
say
there'd
be
no
probable
cause.
however,
i
would
like
to
discuss
with
the
court,
the
factor
that
even
if
the
petitioner
was
brought
before
a
committing
magistrate
and
he
was
released
by
this
committing
magistrate
under
the
florida
procedure
and
under
a
procedure
approved
by
this
court
in
beck
versus
washington.
the
assistant
or
the
state
attorney's
office
or
the
state
prosecuting
official
in
florida
would
still
bring
judges,
bring
former
charges
against
the
petitioner.
mr.
howard
mendelow
no,
as
i
say,
i
don't
know
what
would
happen
at
the
preliminary
hearing
but
suppose
additional
evidence
was
brought
in.
even
on
the
same
evidence,
i
would
make
that
statement.
they
could
be
arrested
on
the
capias
issued
by
the
criminal
court
of
--
mr.
howard
mendelow
we
could
arrest
him,
yes
sir
on
a
capias
issued
by
the
state
attorney's
office
after
he
had
been
discharged
by
the
committing
magistrate.
further,
counsel
for
petitioner
has
stated
that
there
was
no
probable
cause
and
surely
the
committing
magistrate
would
have
released
the
petitioner.
i
say
and
this
is
a
point
that
i
think
it
is
very
important
under
due
process
argument.
let
us
suppose
that
after
the
petitioner
was
arrested,
he
was
brought
before
the
committing
magistrate
and
this
victim
who
had
given
such
a
clear
and
precise
description
to
the
arrest
to
the
officers
in
the
case
had
appeared
at
the
preliminary
hearing
and
had
pointed
to
the
petitioner
and
said,
“yes,
this
is
the
man
that
robbed
me.”
now
we
ask
the
court,
which
would
be
more
susceptible
to
suggestive
identification
that
one
on
one
confrontation
before
the
magistrate
or
the
procedure
that
was
used
in
the
instant
case
where
the
victim
had
to
point
the
particular
petitioner
out
of
the
six-man
lineup?
we
feel
that
due
process
was
not
violated
here
by
requiring
the
petitioner
to
stand
in
a
six-man
lineup
25
hours
after
his
arrest.
mr.
howard
mendelow
it
was
raised
in
that
court
the
same
as
it
was
raised
here,
your
honor,
and
in
the
supreme
court
of
florida
on
the
basis
that
speculatively
the
petitioner
would
have
been
released.
that's
pure
speculation
and
nothing
more.
mr.
howard
mendelow
the
actual
illegal
--
the
lawful
as
so
as
the
illegality
of
the
arrest
per
se
was
not
raised
except
in
the
trial
court.
we
submit
respectfully
so
that
the
petitioner
was
not
prejudiced
in
any
way
in
a
manner
or
reform
but
is
not
being
taken
before
a
committing
magistrate
immediately
after
his
arrest.
one,
because
the
probable
cause
necessarily
for
his
arrest
still
existed
and
he
could
have
been
charged
and
rearrested
by
the
state
prosecuting
officials.
and
number
two,
a
prosecution
could
have
been
forthcoming
based
on
that
information.
and
number
three,
his
conviction
and
this
perhaps
is
the
most
important
aspect
of
the
case.
his
conviction
was
not
based
on
the
lineup
identification
solely.
his
conviction
was
based
on
the
in-court
identification.
independent
of
any
lineup
identification
that
was
subsequently
made
after
his
arrest
and
that
is
clear
from
the
record.
so
therefore,
if
his
prosecution
was
not
dependent
upon
the
lineup,
and
his
conviction
was
not
dependent
on
the
lineup,
how
can
we
say
that
the
petitioner
was
prejudiced
by
not
being
brought
before
a
committing
magistrate?
there
is
just
now
casual
connection
between
prosecution
or
the
conviction
and
is
not
being
brought
before
a
committing
magistrate
in
the
opinion
of
the
respondent
on
this
matter.
therefore,
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
mcnabb-mallory
rule
to
be
extended
to
the
states
under
this
factual
circumstance
and
situation
would
be
a
double
extension
and
not
necessarily
call
for
by
factual
situation
in
this
case.
further,
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
petitioner's
conviction
was
not
in
any
way
based
upon
his
not
being
brought
before
committing
magistrate.
we
respectfully
ask
this
court
to
affirm
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
florida
in
this
cause.
thank
you
very
much.
