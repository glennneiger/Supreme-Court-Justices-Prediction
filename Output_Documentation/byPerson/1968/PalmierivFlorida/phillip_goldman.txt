mr.
phillip
goldman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
hearing
is
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
florida.
by
way
of
background
on
february
6,
1965
and
about
7:30
in
the
morning,
a
small
grocery
store
in
dade
county,
florida
was
robbed.
one
of
the
prosecuting
witnesses
indicated
that
they
had
had
about
one
to
two
minutes
time
to
observe
the
robbery.
about
a
month
later,
march
1,
1965,
the
petitioner,
carmine
vincent
palmieri
was
arrested
in
his
home
at
about
1:30
in
the
morning
without
a
warrant
and
he
was
taken
directly
to
the
jail.
he
was
not
taken
before
magistrate
responsibility.
the
next
day
of
march
2,
1965,
he
was
placed
in
a
lineup
at
the
jail
without
counsel
where
he
was
identified
by
loy
dill,
the
manager
of
the
restaurant
--
the
manager
of
the
grocery
store.
again,
he
had
not
been
taken
before
a
magistrate.
at
least
one
other
lineup
was
held
on
march
8,
1965
some
eight
days
later
at
which
time
the
petitioner
was
again
identified
by
the
son
of
the
manager
of
the
grocery
store,
still,
he
had
been
taken
before
a
magistrate.
for
10
days,
the
petitioner
was
held
without
taken
before
a
magistrate,
without
being
arraigned
and
without
benefit
of
a
counsel
and
not
until
petitioner
had
secured
counsel
and
applied
for
a
petition
of
writ
of
habeas
corpus,
was
he
charged
with
armed
robbery.
at
the
trial
of
this
cause
the
sole
incriminating
--
the
sole
evidence
used
against
him
was
this
lineup
evidence,
this
illegal
lineup
evidence
of
the
two
witnesses.
mr.
phillip
goldman
your
honor,
i
don't
think
there's
any
doubt
when
he
was
arrested
without
probable
cause.
the
supreme
court
of
florida,
that
question
was
not
presented
for
the
supreme
court
of
florida
and
that
question
is
not
spelled
out
in
the
petition.
mr.
phillip
goldman
the
record
showed
--
mr.
phillip
goldman
that's
specifically
except
that
the
only
evidence
they
used
at
the
trial
was
the
illegal
evidence
which
they
gathered
at
a
later
time.
mr.
phillip
goldman
no,
sir
they
have
--
the
record
does
not
speak
as
to
what
they
have.
mr.
phillip
goldman
mr.
justice
stewart,
if
the
court
please,
this
is
an
argument
made
by
the
respondent
--
mr.
phillip
goldman
no,
i
say
this
is
an
argument
advanced
by
that
but
the
record
does
not
reflect
that
the
record
reflects
on
page
15
that
they
took
some
photographs
of
two
after
the
arrest
to
the
prosecuting
witness
and
that
he
identified
one
of
the
photographs.
no
less
than
the
record
does
it
say
that
the
person
he
identified
was
the
petitioner
carmine
vincent
palmieri,
no
less
than
the
record.
as
a
matter
of
fact
is
we're
going
to
draw
an
inference
from
a
solid
record.
the
record
does
show
that
the
son
was
taken
down
--
the
first
person
who
was
arrested
when
the
son
was
taken
down
he
couldn't
identify
him.
so,
if
we're
going
to
make
an
inference
with
solid
record
it
is
that
the
photograph
which
was
identified
by
the
father
was
not
that
of
the
petitioner.
but
the
record
is
silent
on
that
point.
now,
the
record
reveals
and
this
is
a
reflection
on
the
lineup
that
they
robber
was
described
initially
as
a
small
person,
a
person
of
about
130
pounds,
about
5'6‚Äù
and
at
least
one
of
the
lineups
--
they've
made
a
lineup
where
there
were
no
small
people
in
the
lineup
except
the
petitioner.
and
the
prosecuting
witness
indicated
that
he
picked
out
the
smallest
person
in
the
lineup
which
we
say
goes
to
the
dubious
reliability
of
the
lineup.
it
is
also
in
the
record
that
the
father
and
the
son
told
the
story
to
the
police
together
and
it's
also
in
the
record
that
he
had
only
one
to
two
minutes
to
observe
the
time.
now,
the
state
suggest
in
its
brief
that
the
procedure
used
in
the
case
was
similar
to
a
procedure
approved
by
this
court
in
simmons
versus
united
states.
i
respectfully
submit
that
that
just
isn't
the
case.
the
simmons
case
involves
the
use
of
a
pretrial
photograph,
the
identification
of
it.
it
does
not
involve
the
use
of
an
illegal
lineup.
now,
despite
the
continued
objections
and
cross
station
of
petitioner's
trial
counsel,
the
illegal
lineup
evidence
was
used
against
the
petitioner
and
as
a
result
although
this
is
important
as
colloquy
in
the
record
it
shows
that
the
judge
would
not
allow
the
jury
to
hear
the
discussions
as
to
the
defects
in
the
lineup.
but
nevertheless,
the
jury
would
turn
the
verdict
of
guilt
and
he
was
sentenced
to
20
years
in
prison.
mr.
phillip
goldman
it
was
in
the
lineup.
number
one,
there
was
no
counsel.
number
two,
i
think
the
--
mr.
phillip
goldman
this
was
before
this
denno
but
i
don't
want
to
get
in
the
question
of
semantics
with
you
mr.
justice
harlan
but
i
think
the
question
of
this
denno
decision
of
the
dennis
decision
is
that
there
will
be
no
reversals
per
se
of
lineups
without
counsel
which
took
place
prior
to
that
date.
but
it
doesn't
cure
the
illegal
lineup.
the
lineup
was
still
illegal
having
been
held
without
counsel.
and
as
i
understand
the
cases
if
you
take
the
lineup
plus
something
else
this
would
be
--
mr.
phillip
goldman
the
plus
here
is
not
being
taken
for
magistrate
for
10
days
being
held
incommunicado
while
they
made
a
case
against
him.
they
didn't
turn
him
loose
until
they
had
the
case.
mr.
phillip
goldman
i
sure
am
sir.
you're
--
you're
a
little
ahead
of
me.
i
am,
that's
one
point
that
i
guess
and
i
think
--
mr.
phillip
goldman
i
don't
think
it
is
absolutely
necessary.
i
suggest
mr.
justice
black
that
it
fits
but
it
could
be
that
you
could
use
the
totality
of
circumstance
rule
of
mr.
justice
brennan
in
this
denno
case
of
taking
all
the
circumstances
would
bring
about
a
reversal
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
phillip
goldman
the
lineups
occurred
before
he
was
ever
taken
for
magistrate.
until
this
day,
he
--
mr.
phillip
goldman
well,
mr.
phillip
goldman
--
mr.
justice
fortas,
had
there
been,
had
he
been
taken
for
magistrate
in
my
judgment
he
would
have
been
turn
loose
because
if
we
presumed
that
the
magistrate
will
do
his
duty
there
was
no
probable
cause.
in
other
words,
all
the
evidence
used
at
the
trial
came
later.
number
two,
he
would
have
an
opportunity
to
secure
counsel
that's
one
of
the
purposes
of
preliminary
hearing.
he
would
have
the
opportunity
--
mr.
phillip
goldman
i'm
relying
on
the
whole
picture.
primarily
i'm
relying
on
the
failure
to
take
him
before
a
magistrate
within
that
time
which
it
shocked
me.
my
practice's
attention
is
essentially
civil
with
the
corporate
firm
and
i
was
shocked
to
find
that
this
sort
of
things
still
goes
on
and
as
i
dealt
into
it,
i
was
even
more
shocked
to
find
the
extent
to
which
it
goes
on
because
many
states
have
these
statutes
and
most
of
the
states
apparently
ignored
the
statutes
as
i've
said
the
case
is
in
the
footnote
in
our
brief
which
indicate
this
point.
now,
i
think
--
mr.
phillip
goldman
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
i
believe
we
recessed
at
about
the
point
where
the
defendant
had
been
convicted
by
the
trial
court.
an
appeal
was
taken
to
the
third
district
court
of
appeal
which
is
in
the
florida
setup
with
normally
be
defined
appellate
court.
that
court's
opinion
after
reviewing
the
sequence
of
advance
conclude
that
shows
on
the
face
of
it
that
it
was
upset
with
the
wrongs
that
had
been
done
in
the
petition.
but
without
attempt
to
be
fictitious
in
any
manner
that
court
concluded
that
under
the
doctrine
of
stare
decisis
that
they
had
previously
approved
the
matters
where
man
had
not
been
taken
before
magistrates
timely
while
evidence
have
been
gathered
against
him,
they
affirmed
on
that
basis.
but
they
had
some
reservations
and
under
the
florida
constitution
article
v,
section
4,
they
certified
the
question
to
the
supreme
court
of
florida
and
the
question
of
great
public
interest.
under
the
supreme
court
of
florida,
affirmed
again
and
they
answered
the
question
that
they
propounded
to
him.
and
this
court
also
reviewed
the
sequence
of
advance
and
concluded
that
the
petitioner
had
been
wrong.
but
the
supreme
court
of
florida
went
on
a
basis
that
was
harmless
error
that
he
had
not
been
harmed,
that
had
not
been
prejudiced.
and
i
really
could
not
understand
how
this
result
could
be
reached
in
the
face
of
the
fact
that
all
of
the
evidence
introduced
at
the
trial
was
the
evidence
which
was
developed
during
the
unlawful
detention.
the
court
also
noted
that
the
petitioner
hadn't
requested
to
be
taken
before
a
magistrate
and
based
its
decision
in
part
on
that,
actually
the
record
on
this
point
is
silent
and
as
this
court
have
stated
in
conley
decision,
a
waiver
cannot
be
inferred,
it's
not
permissive
from
the
silent
record.
the
record
here
is
silent.
also
in
the
conley
case,
the
court
pointed
out
with
respect
to
assistance
of
counsel,
the
assistance
of
counsel
does
not
turn
on
a
request.
and
i
respectfully
submit
that
by
analogy
the
right
to
put
to
hearing
before
a
magistrate
should
not
turn
upon
a
request.
actually,
in
its
brief
before
this
court,
the
state
continues
to
rely
on
the
fact
of
a
lack
of
prejudicial
error
and
as
i
submitted
it
before
if
this
man
had
been
taken
before
a
magistrate
as
required
by
law
under
section
901.23
of
the
florida
statutes
or
if
it
became
a
constitutional
mandate,
he
would
have
been
turn
loose
because
all
the
evidence
that
was
used
against
him
was
gathered
after
that
took
place.
the
only
other
point
is
the
point
suggested
by
mr.
justice
stewart
from
that
perhaps
there
had
been
this
identification
but
as
i
pointed
out
in
this
record,
there
was
no
identification
of
a
photograph
of
this
particular
individual.
now
we,
respectfully
--
mr.
phillip
goldman
it
is
not
a
part
of
--
we
are
not
using
the
once
on
the
case,
the
doctrine
of
an
illegal
arrest.
mr.
phillip
goldman
that's
right.
yes,
sir,
that's
right.
our
major
point
is
that
the
mcnabb-mallory
rule
should
be
applied
to
state
court
proceedings
as
a
constitutional
mandate.
now,
as
this
court
knows
that
mcnabb-mallory
rule
stems
with
the
decision
of
this
court
which
holds
that
if
the
dependant
is
unlawfully
detained
in
violation
of
rule
5
(a)
of
the
federal
criminal
rules
and
procedure
that
evidence
gathered
during
that
time
cannot
be
used
in
the
conviction
based
on
such
evidence
will
be
reversed.
similar
provisions
in
the
form
of
legislation
requiring
that
arrested
person
to
be
promptly
taken
before
magistrate
exists
and
practically
every
state
in
the
union
i
have
collected
in
the
footnote
of
those
cases
in
our
brief.
interestingly
enough
as
that
point
out
in
there.
many,
many
states
ignore
this
as
the
florida
case
does.
as
a
matter
of
fact
and
i'm
sure
the
attorney
general
can
tell
you
since
this
decision.
the
supreme
court
of
florida
has
in
a
number
of
cases
continued
to
ignore
the
provisions
of
901.23.
now,
although
mcnabb-mallory
rule
has
been
a
rule
applicable
to
federal
court
proceedings,
i
think
its
an
interesting
coincidence
that
in
the
case
milton
versus
cochran
which
is
a
supreme
court
of
florida
case,
the
supreme
court
resided
that
if
it
didn't
start
to
do
something
about
stopping
this
failure
to
take
the
man
before
magistrate
that
this
court
of
some
other
federal
court
would
adopt
the
mcnabb-mallory
rule.
and
without
attempting
to
be
fictitious,
i
respectfully
suggest
that
the
time
has
come
to
make
a
profit
out
of
the
supreme
of
florida
because
the
mcnabb-mallory
rule
is
an
essential
part
of
due
process.
in
the
mcnabb
case,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
and
i
won't
repeat
it
but
he
makes
an
eloquent
exposition
as
to
the
rational
of
that
case,
the
public
policy
behind
the
rule.
certainly,
due
process
requires
that
the
police
must
with
reasonable
profits,
show
legal
cause
for
detaining
an
arrested
person.
and
if
this
is
an
important
safeguard
not
only
to
convict
form
the
innocent
but
towards
actually
convicting
the
guilty
in
an
enlightened
society.
this
rational
of
this
case
applies
certainly
to
state
court
proceedings.
i
think
it's
also
interesting
that
in
both
mcnabb
and
mallory
decisions,
this
court
did
not
reject
the
constitutional
concept.
it
says
that
it
wasn't
getting
into
it,
in
other
words,
it
didn't
reached
the
constitutional
question.
and
at
deciding
this
question
of
legislative
intent,
construction
and
interpretation
of
a
rule
5
(a).
mr.
phillip
goldman
yes,
sir.
mr.
phillip
goldman
yes,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
phillip
goldman
the
klapp
hold
case
cited
in
the
second
district
case
in
which
this
court
denied
cert
which
involved
search
and
seizure
other
than
the
confession.
now,
this
is
an
argument
made
by
the
state
too.
it
is
true
that
both
mcnabb
and
mallory
were
confession
cases
but
in
fairness
because
i'm
an
advocate
within
and
attempting
to
be
objective
in
reading.
the
rational
of
those
decisions
is
the
unlawful
detention.
in
other
word,
this
court
has
never
held
of
a
confession
per
se
as
illegal.
it's
only
a
confession
which
is
gathered
under
certain
circumstances
which
is
illegal.
and
the
circumstances
of
mcnabb-mallory
is
the
violation
of
rule
5
(a).
certainly,
there's
nothing
in
need
of
those
decision
that
indicates
so
that
the
tainting
was
something
other
than
a
confession
that
a
different
result
would
be
reached.
but
there
is
that
difference
in
the
case
you
suggest
your
honor.
now,
i
think
as
this
court
knows,
the
purpose
of
a
preliminary
hearing
is
to
weed
out
groundless
or
unsupported
charge
of
grave
offenses
and
to
relieve
an
accused
of
a
degradation
and
expense
of
a
criminal
trial.
certainly,
a
quick
determination
of
probable
cause
isn't
assessed
in
any
esteem
of
due
process.
the
preliminary
hearing
also
serves
another
purpose.
it
gives
an
opportunity
for
bail
which
is
of
course
a
constitutional
right.
it
gives
the
opportunity
for
counsel
being
appointed
or
being
retained
which
is
also
a
constitutional
right.
the
fact,
that
so
many
of
our
states,
practically
all
of
our
states
have
an
active
legislation
in
effect
adopting
rule
5
(a)
as
a
part
of
their
own
state
is
indicative
of
the
extent
which
this
is
ingrain
in
our
concepts
of
due
process
of
law.
and
we
respect
and
submit
that
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
certainly
the
due
process
provisions
required
that
the
state
of
florida
defendant
due
process
of
law
not
only
during
the
trial
period
of
the
former
trial
but
throughout
his
entire
accusatory
period.
i
think
that
was
the
escobedo
case.
and
we're
suggesting
that
as
a
part
of
that
due
process
requires
that
a
man
being
taken
before
a
magistrate
within
a
reasonable
period
of
time.
in
some
case,
as
you
might
have
an
expiration
of
the
outer
orbits
of
what
constitutes
a
reasonable
period
of
time.
i
submit
you
don't
have
to
decide
that
now
because
10
days
is
certainly
an
unreasonable
period
of
time.
the
record
here
reflects
when
the
counsel
asked
the
police
officers
said,
‚Äúare
you
aware
of
the
statute
requiring
taken
before
magistrate?‚Äù
and
he
said,
‚Äúyes,
sir.‚Äù
and
he
said,
‚Äúwhy
didn't
you
do
it?‚Äù
and
he
said,
‚Äúwell,
it
was
2:30
in
the
morning.‚Äù
the
record
is
silent
as
to
why
he
didn't
do
it
the
next
day
or
the
next
day
or
the
next
day
after
that
for
10
days
when
he
still
didn't
do
it.
now,
this
idea
of
the
constitutional
requirement
of
mcnabb-mallory
is
not
as
unique
as
it
might
sound
the
first
blush.
this
court
has
so
many
instances
in
cases
which
were
cited
in
our
brief
reversed
state
court
convictions
where
the
person
was
unlawfully
held
incommunicado
without
advice
of
counsel
or
friend.
that
by
analogy
is
also
appropriate
here.
this
man
was
actually
held
incommunicado
for
10
days.
in
fact,
the
case
of
watts
versus
indiana
with
mr.
justice
marshall
was
recognized
because
it
was
one
of
his
cases.
although,
this
court
could
not
expressly
apply
the
mcnabb-mallory
rule
it
came
very
close
to
it
in
reversing
the
state
court
conviction
and
one
of
the
grounds
cited
was
that
a
preliminary
hearing
under
the
--as
replied
by
the
law
of
indiana
had
not
been
given
and
we
respectfully
submit
that
this
should
be
a
part
of
due
process.
now,
it
would
probably
be
urged
that
the
application
of
the
mcnabb-mallory
rule
to
state
court
proceedings
is
going
to
hamper
effective
law
enforcement.
that
seems
to
be
the
present
cry
these
days.
but
i
respectfully
submit
that
nothing
could
be
further
from
the
truth
as
this
court
knows
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
has
had
to
live
with
the
mcnabb-mallory
rule
in
rule
5
(a)
of
the
federal
criminal
procedure
rules
for
over
15
years
now
and
they
still
remain
one
of
the
most
effective
law
enforcement
organization
in
this
country
if
not
in
the
united
states.
actually,
with
respect
to
the
lineups,
the
language
of
this
court
in
the
wade
case
is
singularly
appropriate
here.
in
that
case,
the
court
points
out
the
vagaries
of
eyewitness
identification
here.
there
was
one
to
two
minutes
as
an
opportunity
to
observe.
the
case
points
out
the
fact
that
criminal
law
history
is
right
with
the
instances
of
mistaken
identification
and
the
difficulty
with
identifying
a
stranger.
i
think
the
part
that
is
singularly
applicable
here
is
the
part
where
this
court
points
out
that
it
is
a
matter
of
common
experience
that
once
the
person
has
made
up
his
mind,
nothing
can
change.
if
so
that
the
identification
takes
place
actually
at
pretrial
rather
in
a
in
trial.
actually,
we
respectfully
submit
that
under
the
facts
of
this
case,
the
mcnabb-mallory
rule
should
apply.
but
in
fairness
to
and
i
think
it
fits
and
i
think
it's
a
necessary
holding.
but
in
fairness
to
my
client,
i
wish
the
urge
at
this
point
that
if
this
court
in
its
wisdom
does
not
think
that
the
mcnabb-mallory
rule
should
be
applied
then
i
suggest
that
the
totality
of
circumstance
rule
which
this
court
has
supplied
in
other
instances
requires
a
reversal
under
the
mandate
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
constitution.
by
that,
i'm
referring
to
the
decision,
i
think
its
cardozo
and
mr.
justice
cardozo
in
the
palko
case
in
the
defense
order
of
the
liberty
or
if
it
violates
the
sense
of
justice
or
of
the
totality
of
circumstances
indicate
that
there
was
not
a
fair
trial.
certainly,
the
facts
in
this
case
the
taking
of
a
man
from
his
home
at
night,
1:30
in
the
morning
over
a
month
after
the
crime
was
convicted
--
it
was
committed,
subjecting
him
to
two
lineups
over
10-day
period
without
the
counsel,
without
the
benefit
of
a
magistrate.
all
these
facts
together
constitute,
in
my
judgment,
a
monstrous
affront
to
the
dignity
of
man
and
that
this
conviction
should
be
reversed.
mr.
phillip
goldman
armed
robbery
sir,
and
conviction
is
20
years
in
prison.
that
completes
my
submission.
mr.
phillip
goldman
i
have
no
further
comments.
mr.
phillip
goldman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
hearing
is
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
florida.
by
way
of
background
on
february
6,
1965
and
about
7:30
in
the
morning,
a
small
grocery
store
in
dade
county,
florida
was
robbed.
one
of
the
prosecuting
witnesses
indicated
that
they
had
had
about
one
to
two
minutes
time
to
observe
the
robbery.
about
a
month
later,
march
1,
1965,
the
petitioner,
carmine
vincent
palmieri
was
arrested
in
his
home
at
about
1:30
in
the
morning
without
a
warrant
and
he
was
taken
directly
to
the
jail.
he
was
not
taken
before
magistrate
responsibility.
the
next
day
of
march
2,
1965,
he
was
placed
in
a
lineup
at
the
jail
without
counsel
where
he
was
identified
by
loy
dill,
the
manager
of
the
restaurant
--
the
manager
of
the
grocery
store.
again,
he
had
not
been
taken
before
a
magistrate.
at
least
one
other
lineup
was
held
on
march
8,
1965
some
eight
days
later
at
which
time
the
petitioner
was
again
identified
by
the
son
of
the
manager
of
the
grocery
store,
still,
he
had
been
taken
before
a
magistrate.
for
10
days,
the
petitioner
was
held
without
taken
before
a
magistrate,
without
being
arraigned
and
without
benefit
of
a
counsel
and
not
until
petitioner
had
secured
counsel
and
applied
for
a
petition
of
writ
of
habeas
corpus,
was
he
charged
with
armed
robbery.
at
the
trial
of
this
cause
the
sole
incriminating
--
the
sole
evidence
used
against
him
was
this
lineup
evidence,
this
illegal
lineup
evidence
of
the
two
witnesses.
mr.
phillip
goldman
your
honor,
i
don't
think
there's
any
doubt
when
he
was
arrested
without
probable
cause.
the
supreme
court
of
florida,
that
question
was
not
presented
for
the
supreme
court
of
florida
and
that
question
is
not
spelled
out
in
the
petition.
mr.
phillip
goldman
the
record
showed
--
mr.
phillip
goldman
that's
specifically
except
that
the
only
evidence
they
used
at
the
trial
was
the
illegal
evidence
which
they
gathered
at
a
later
time.
mr.
phillip
goldman
no,
sir
they
have
--
the
record
does
not
speak
as
to
what
they
have.
mr.
phillip
goldman
mr.
justice
stewart,
if
the
court
please,
this
is
an
argument
made
by
the
respondent
--
mr.
phillip
goldman
no,
i
say
this
is
an
argument
advanced
by
that
but
the
record
does
not
reflect
that
the
record
reflects
on
page
15
that
they
took
some
photographs
of
two
after
the
arrest
to
the
prosecuting
witness
and
that
he
identified
one
of
the
photographs.
no
less
than
the
record
does
it
say
that
the
person
he
identified
was
the
petitioner
carmine
vincent
palmieri,
no
less
than
the
record.
as
a
matter
of
fact
is
we're
going
to
draw
an
inference
from
a
solid
record.
the
record
does
show
that
the
son
was
taken
down
--
the
first
person
who
was
arrested
when
the
son
was
taken
down
he
couldn't
identify
him.
so,
if
we're
going
to
make
an
inference
with
solid
record
it
is
that
the
photograph
which
was
identified
by
the
father
was
not
that
of
the
petitioner.
but
the
record
is
silent
on
that
point.
now,
the
record
reveals
and
this
is
a
reflection
on
the
lineup
that
they
robber
was
described
initially
as
a
small
person,
a
person
of
about
130
pounds,
about
5'6‚Äù
and
at
least
one
of
the
lineups
--
they've
made
a
lineup
where
there
were
no
small
people
in
the
lineup
except
the
petitioner.
and
the
prosecuting
witness
indicated
that
he
picked
out
the
smallest
person
in
the
lineup
which
we
say
goes
to
the
dubious
reliability
of
the
lineup.
it
is
also
in
the
record
that
the
father
and
the
son
told
the
story
to
the
police
together
and
it's
also
in
the
record
that
he
had
only
one
to
two
minutes
to
observe
the
time.
now,
the
state
suggest
in
its
brief
that
the
procedure
used
in
the
case
was
similar
to
a
procedure
approved
by
this
court
in
simmons
versus
united
states.
i
respectfully
submit
that
that
just
isn't
the
case.
the
simmons
case
involves
the
use
of
a
pretrial
photograph,
the
identification
of
it.
it
does
not
involve
the
use
of
an
illegal
lineup.
now,
despite
the
continued
objections
and
cross
station
of
petitioner's
trial
counsel,
the
illegal
lineup
evidence
was
used
against
the
petitioner
and
as
a
result
although
this
is
important
as
colloquy
in
the
record
it
shows
that
the
judge
would
not
allow
the
jury
to
hear
the
discussions
as
to
the
defects
in
the
lineup.
but
nevertheless,
the
jury
would
turn
the
verdict
of
guilt
and
he
was
sentenced
to
20
years
in
prison.
mr.
phillip
goldman
it
was
in
the
lineup.
number
one,
there
was
no
counsel.
number
two,
i
think
the
--
mr.
phillip
goldman
this
was
before
this
denno
but
i
don't
want
to
get
in
the
question
of
semantics
with
you
mr.
justice
harlan
but
i
think
the
question
of
this
denno
decision
of
the
dennis
decision
is
that
there
will
be
no
reversals
per
se
of
lineups
without
counsel
which
took
place
prior
to
that
date.
but
it
doesn't
cure
the
illegal
lineup.
the
lineup
was
still
illegal
having
been
held
without
counsel.
and
as
i
understand
the
cases
if
you
take
the
lineup
plus
something
else
this
would
be
--
mr.
phillip
goldman
the
plus
here
is
not
being
taken
for
magistrate
for
10
days
being
held
incommunicado
while
they
made
a
case
against
him.
they
didn't
turn
him
loose
until
they
had
the
case.
mr.
phillip
goldman
i
sure
am
sir.
you're
--
you're
a
little
ahead
of
me.
i
am,
that's
one
point
that
i
guess
and
i
think
--
mr.
phillip
goldman
i
don't
think
it
is
absolutely
necessary.
i
suggest
mr.
justice
black
that
it
fits
but
it
could
be
that
you
could
use
the
totality
of
circumstance
rule
of
mr.
justice
brennan
in
this
denno
case
of
taking
all
the
circumstances
would
bring
about
a
reversal
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
phillip
goldman
the
lineups
occurred
before
he
was
ever
taken
for
magistrate.
until
this
day,
he
--
mr.
phillip
goldman
well,
mr.
phillip
goldman
--
mr.
justice
fortas,
had
there
been,
had
he
been
taken
for
magistrate
in
my
judgment
he
would
have
been
turn
loose
because
if
we
presumed
that
the
magistrate
will
do
his
duty
there
was
no
probable
cause.
in
other
words,
all
the
evidence
used
at
the
trial
came
later.
number
two,
he
would
have
an
opportunity
to
secure
counsel
that's
one
of
the
purposes
of
preliminary
hearing.
he
would
have
the
opportunity
--
mr.
phillip
goldman
i'm
relying
on
the
whole
picture.
primarily
i'm
relying
on
the
failure
to
take
him
before
a
magistrate
within
that
time
which
it
shocked
me.
my
practice's
attention
is
essentially
civil
with
the
corporate
firm
and
i
was
shocked
to
find
that
this
sort
of
things
still
goes
on
and
as
i
dealt
into
it,
i
was
even
more
shocked
to
find
the
extent
to
which
it
goes
on
because
many
states
have
these
statutes
and
most
of
the
states
apparently
ignored
the
statutes
as
i've
said
the
case
is
in
the
footnote
in
our
brief
which
indicate
this
point.
now,
i
think
--
mr.
phillip
goldman
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
i
believe
we
recessed
at
about
the
point
where
the
defendant
had
been
convicted
by
the
trial
court.
an
appeal
was
taken
to
the
third
district
court
of
appeal
which
is
in
the
florida
setup
with
normally
be
defined
appellate
court.
that
court's
opinion
after
reviewing
the
sequence
of
advance
conclude
that
shows
on
the
face
of
it
that
it
was
upset
with
the
wrongs
that
had
been
done
in
the
petition.
but
without
attempt
to
be
fictitious
in
any
manner
that
court
concluded
that
under
the
doctrine
of
stare
decisis
that
they
had
previously
approved
the
matters
where
man
had
not
been
taken
before
magistrates
timely
while
evidence
have
been
gathered
against
him,
they
affirmed
on
that
basis.
but
they
had
some
reservations
and
under
the
florida
constitution
article
v,
section
4,
they
certified
the
question
to
the
supreme
court
of
florida
and
the
question
of
great
public
interest.
under
the
supreme
court
of
florida,
affirmed
again
and
they
answered
the
question
that
they
propounded
to
him.
and
this
court
also
reviewed
the
sequence
of
advance
and
concluded
that
the
petitioner
had
been
wrong.
but
the
supreme
court
of
florida
went
on
a
basis
that
was
harmless
error
that
he
had
not
been
harmed,
that
had
not
been
prejudiced.
and
i
really
could
not
understand
how
this
result
could
be
reached
in
the
face
of
the
fact
that
all
of
the
evidence
introduced
at
the
trial
was
the
evidence
which
was
developed
during
the
unlawful
detention.
the
court
also
noted
that
the
petitioner
hadn't
requested
to
be
taken
before
a
magistrate
and
based
its
decision
in
part
on
that,
actually
the
record
on
this
point
is
silent
and
as
this
court
have
stated
in
conley
decision,
a
waiver
cannot
be
inferred,
it's
not
permissive
from
the
silent
record.
the
record
here
is
silent.
also
in
the
conley
case,
the
court
pointed
out
with
respect
to
assistance
of
counsel,
the
assistance
of
counsel
does
not
turn
on
a
request.
and
i
respectfully
submit
that
by
analogy
the
right
to
put
to
hearing
before
a
magistrate
should
not
turn
upon
a
request.
actually,
in
its
brief
before
this
court,
the
state
continues
to
rely
on
the
fact
of
a
lack
of
prejudicial
error
and
as
i
submitted
it
before
if
this
man
had
been
taken
before
a
magistrate
as
required
by
law
under
section
901.23
of
the
florida
statutes
or
if
it
became
a
constitutional
mandate,
he
would
have
been
turn
loose
because
all
the
evidence
that
was
used
against
him
was
gathered
after
that
took
place.
the
only
other
point
is
the
point
suggested
by
mr.
justice
stewart
from
that
perhaps
there
had
been
this
identification
but
as
i
pointed
out
in
this
record,
there
was
no
identification
of
a
photograph
of
this
particular
individual.
now
we,
respectfully
--
mr.
phillip
goldman
it
is
not
a
part
of
--
we
are
not
using
the
once
on
the
case,
the
doctrine
of
an
illegal
arrest.
mr.
phillip
goldman
that's
right.
yes,
sir,
that's
right.
our
major
point
is
that
the
mcnabb-mallory
rule
should
be
applied
to
state
court
proceedings
as
a
constitutional
mandate.
now,
as
this
court
knows
that
mcnabb-mallory
rule
stems
with
the
decision
of
this
court
which
holds
that
if
the
dependant
is
unlawfully
detained
in
violation
of
rule
5
(a)
of
the
federal
criminal
rules
and
procedure
that
evidence
gathered
during
that
time
cannot
be
used
in
the
conviction
based
on
such
evidence
will
be
reversed.
similar
provisions
in
the
form
of
legislation
requiring
that
arrested
person
to
be
promptly
taken
before
magistrate
exists
and
practically
every
state
in
the
union
i
have
collected
in
the
footnote
of
those
cases
in
our
brief.
interestingly
enough
as
that
point
out
in
there.
many,
many
states
ignore
this
as
the
florida
case
does.
as
a
matter
of
fact
and
i'm
sure
the
attorney
general
can
tell
you
since
this
decision.
the
supreme
court
of
florida
has
in
a
number
of
cases
continued
to
ignore
the
provisions
of
901.23.
now,
although
mcnabb-mallory
rule
has
been
a
rule
applicable
to
federal
court
proceedings,
i
think
its
an
interesting
coincidence
that
in
the
case
milton
versus
cochran
which
is
a
supreme
court
of
florida
case,
the
supreme
court
resided
that
if
it
didn't
start
to
do
something
about
stopping
this
failure
to
take
the
man
before
magistrate
that
this
court
of
some
other
federal
court
would
adopt
the
mcnabb-mallory
rule.
and
without
attempting
to
be
fictitious,
i
respectfully
suggest
that
the
time
has
come
to
make
a
profit
out
of
the
supreme
of
florida
because
the
mcnabb-mallory
rule
is
an
essential
part
of
due
process.
in
the
mcnabb
case,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
and
i
won't
repeat
it
but
he
makes
an
eloquent
exposition
as
to
the
rational
of
that
case,
the
public
policy
behind
the
rule.
certainly,
due
process
requires
that
the
police
must
with
reasonable
profits,
show
legal
cause
for
detaining
an
arrested
person.
and
if
this
is
an
important
safeguard
not
only
to
convict
form
the
innocent
but
towards
actually
convicting
the
guilty
in
an
enlightened
society.
this
rational
of
this
case
applies
certainly
to
state
court
proceedings.
i
think
it's
also
interesting
that
in
both
mcnabb
and
mallory
decisions,
this
court
did
not
reject
the
constitutional
concept.
it
says
that
it
wasn't
getting
into
it,
in
other
words,
it
didn't
reached
the
constitutional
question.
and
at
deciding
this
question
of
legislative
intent,
construction
and
interpretation
of
a
rule
5
(a).
mr.
phillip
goldman
yes,
sir.
mr.
phillip
goldman
yes,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
phillip
goldman
the
klapp
hold
case
cited
in
the
second
district
case
in
which
this
court
denied
cert
which
involved
search
and
seizure
other
than
the
confession.
now,
this
is
an
argument
made
by
the
state
too.
it
is
true
that
both
mcnabb
and
mallory
were
confession
cases
but
in
fairness
because
i'm
an
advocate
within
and
attempting
to
be
objective
in
reading.
the
rational
of
those
decisions
is
the
unlawful
detention.
in
other
word,
this
court
has
never
held
of
a
confession
per
se
as
illegal.
it's
only
a
confession
which
is
gathered
under
certain
circumstances
which
is
illegal.
and
the
circumstances
of
mcnabb-mallory
is
the
violation
of
rule
5
(a).
certainly,
there's
nothing
in
need
of
those
decision
that
indicates
so
that
the
tainting
was
something
other
than
a
confession
that
a
different
result
would
be
reached.
but
there
is
that
difference
in
the
case
you
suggest
your
honor.
now,
i
think
as
this
court
knows,
the
purpose
of
a
preliminary
hearing
is
to
weed
out
groundless
or
unsupported
charge
of
grave
offenses
and
to
relieve
an
accused
of
a
degradation
and
expense
of
a
criminal
trial.
certainly,
a
quick
determination
of
probable
cause
isn't
assessed
in
any
esteem
of
due
process.
the
preliminary
hearing
also
serves
another
purpose.
it
gives
an
opportunity
for
bail
which
is
of
course
a
constitutional
right.
it
gives
the
opportunity
for
counsel
being
appointed
or
being
retained
which
is
also
a
constitutional
right.
the
fact,
that
so
many
of
our
states,
practically
all
of
our
states
have
an
active
legislation
in
effect
adopting
rule
5
(a)
as
a
part
of
their
own
state
is
indicative
of
the
extent
which
this
is
ingrain
in
our
concepts
of
due
process
of
law.
and
we
respect
and
submit
that
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
certainly
the
due
process
provisions
required
that
the
state
of
florida
defendant
due
process
of
law
not
only
during
the
trial
period
of
the
former
trial
but
throughout
his
entire
accusatory
period.
i
think
that
was
the
escobedo
case.
and
we're
suggesting
that
as
a
part
of
that
due
process
requires
that
a
man
being
taken
before
a
magistrate
within
a
reasonable
period
of
time.
in
some
case,
as
you
might
have
an
expiration
of
the
outer
orbits
of
what
constitutes
a
reasonable
period
of
time.
i
submit
you
don't
have
to
decide
that
now
because
10
days
is
certainly
an
unreasonable
period
of
time.
the
record
here
reflects
when
the
counsel
asked
the
police
officers
said,
‚Äúare
you
aware
of
the
statute
requiring
taken
before
magistrate?‚Äù
and
he
said,
‚Äúyes,
sir.‚Äù
and
he
said,
‚Äúwhy
didn't
you
do
it?‚Äù
and
he
said,
‚Äúwell,
it
was
2:30
in
the
morning.‚Äù
the
record
is
silent
as
to
why
he
didn't
do
it
the
next
day
or
the
next
day
or
the
next
day
after
that
for
10
days
when
he
still
didn't
do
it.
now,
this
idea
of
the
constitutional
requirement
of
mcnabb-mallory
is
not
as
unique
as
it
might
sound
the
first
blush.
this
court
has
so
many
instances
in
cases
which
were
cited
in
our
brief
reversed
state
court
convictions
where
the
person
was
unlawfully
held
incommunicado
without
advice
of
counsel
or
friend.
that
by
analogy
is
also
appropriate
here.
this
man
was
actually
held
incommunicado
for
10
days.
in
fact,
the
case
of
watts
versus
indiana
with
mr.
justice
marshall
was
recognized
because
it
was
one
of
his
cases.
although,
this
court
could
not
expressly
apply
the
mcnabb-mallory
rule
it
came
very
close
to
it
in
reversing
the
state
court
conviction
and
one
of
the
grounds
cited
was
that
a
preliminary
hearing
under
the
--as
replied
by
the
law
of
indiana
had
not
been
given
and
we
respectfully
submit
that
this
should
be
a
part
of
due
process.
now,
it
would
probably
be
urged
that
the
application
of
the
mcnabb-mallory
rule
to
state
court
proceedings
is
going
to
hamper
effective
law
enforcement.
that
seems
to
be
the
present
cry
these
days.
but
i
respectfully
submit
that
nothing
could
be
further
from
the
truth
as
this
court
knows
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
has
had
to
live
with
the
mcnabb-mallory
rule
in
rule
5
(a)
of
the
federal
criminal
procedure
rules
for
over
15
years
now
and
they
still
remain
one
of
the
most
effective
law
enforcement
organization
in
this
country
if
not
in
the
united
states.
actually,
with
respect
to
the
lineups,
the
language
of
this
court
in
the
wade
case
is
singularly
appropriate
here.
in
that
case,
the
court
points
out
the
vagaries
of
eyewitness
identification
here.
there
was
one
to
two
minutes
as
an
opportunity
to
observe.
the
case
points
out
the
fact
that
criminal
law
history
is
right
with
the
instances
of
mistaken
identification
and
the
difficulty
with
identifying
a
stranger.
i
think
the
part
that
is
singularly
applicable
here
is
the
part
where
this
court
points
out
that
it
is
a
matter
of
common
experience
that
once
the
person
has
made
up
his
mind,
nothing
can
change.
if
so
that
the
identification
takes
place
actually
at
pretrial
rather
in
a
in
trial.
actually,
we
respectfully
submit
that
under
the
facts
of
this
case,
the
mcnabb-mallory
rule
should
apply.
but
in
fairness
to
and
i
think
it
fits
and
i
think
it's
a
necessary
holding.
but
in
fairness
to
my
client,
i
wish
the
urge
at
this
point
that
if
this
court
in
its
wisdom
does
not
think
that
the
mcnabb-mallory
rule
should
be
applied
then
i
suggest
that
the
totality
of
circumstance
rule
which
this
court
has
supplied
in
other
instances
requires
a
reversal
under
the
mandate
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
constitution.
by
that,
i'm
referring
to
the
decision,
i
think
its
cardozo
and
mr.
justice
cardozo
in
the
palko
case
in
the
defense
order
of
the
liberty
or
if
it
violates
the
sense
of
justice
or
of
the
totality
of
circumstances
indicate
that
there
was
not
a
fair
trial.
certainly,
the
facts
in
this
case
the
taking
of
a
man
from
his
home
at
night,
1:30
in
the
morning
over
a
month
after
the
crime
was
convicted
--
it
was
committed,
subjecting
him
to
two
lineups
over
10-day
period
without
the
counsel,
without
the
benefit
of
a
magistrate.
all
these
facts
together
constitute,
in
my
judgment,
a
monstrous
affront
to
the
dignity
of
man
and
that
this
conviction
should
be
reversed.
mr.
phillip
goldman
armed
robbery
sir,
and
conviction
is
20
years
in
prison.
that
completes
my
submission.
mr.
phillip
goldman
i
have
no
further
comments.
