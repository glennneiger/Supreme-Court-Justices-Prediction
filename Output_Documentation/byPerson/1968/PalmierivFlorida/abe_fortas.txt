justice
abe
fortas
let's
say
when
was
the
lineup
in
connect
--
in
conjunction
with
his
being
taken
before
the
magistrate,
when
did
the
lineup
occur?
justice
abe
fortas
then
what's
the
connection
between
the
two
lineups?
certain
thing
makes
him
look
more
like
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
a
villain.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
it
sounds
for
me
as
if
you're
really
relying
on
the
absence
of
counsels
by
the
factors
before
you?
justice
abe
fortas
is
there
anything
else
sir
that
occurred
during
the
time
of
the
detention
which
i
think
that
it's
agreeing
was
unlawful
in
the
florida
law?
is
there
anything
else
except
for
the
lineup
that
occurred
according
to
the
record?
we
have
only
this
appendix
to
which
is
not
the
complete
transcript.
justice
abe
fortas
two
lineups?
justice
abe
fortas
is
there
any
evidence
in
this
record
of
prolonged
questioning?
justice
abe
fortas
alright,
that's
what
sort
of
baffling
about
this
case
that
is
to
say
that
do
we
have
before
this
record
showing
that
the
man
was
kept
in
jail
for
10
days
and
have
violation
of
florida
statute
which
requires
that
it
be
taken
before
the
magistrate
and
the
courts
below
seemed
to
agree
that
there
was
some
violation
of
the
florida
statute.
but
the
record
didn't
show
anything
that
happened
except
the
two
lineups.
justice
abe
fortas
but
am
i
correct
or
incorrect
in
saying
that
the
--in
recalling
that
the
court
below
seems
to
agree
that
it's
a
violation
of
the
florida
statute
which
says,
number
one,
indicates
of
maybe
the
remedy
as
not
to
set
aside
of
the
conviction.
number
two,
that
it's
not
prejudicial
justice
abe
fortas
thank
you.
justice
abe
fortas
you
mean,
make
it
applicable
to
the
lineup?
justice
abe
fortas
in
what
charge
was
he
booked?
was
it
before
investigation
or?
justice
abe
fortas
you
don't
know
whether
that's
so
or
not?
justice
abe
fortas
is
there
any
--
and
you
also
said
in
response
to
justice
marshall's
question
as
i
understand
it
that,
there
are
no
cases
under
this
florida
statute?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
what's
the
maximum
period
of
detention?
how
long
can
a
person
be
held
without
being
charged
or
taken
before
a
magistrate?
is
there
any
indication
this
to
that
in
the
florida
case
