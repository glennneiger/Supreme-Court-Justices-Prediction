chief
justice
earl
warren
well
ms.
rosenberg,
what
do
you
think
that
the
situation
of
this
kind
where
we
have
an
ignorant,
illiterate
foreigner
who
is
being
tried
for
an
offense
and
he
hears
his
colloquy
in
court
and
then
shortly
after
30
days,
attempts
to
perfect
his
appeal
and
in
two
subsequent
proceedings.
the
district
court
examining
the
records
and
remembering
what
happened
on
both
occasions
treated
this
as
an
oral
notice
of
appeal
and
the
two
different
panels
of
the
court
of
appeals
considered
it
as
an
oral
notice.
do
you
not
believe
that
that
brings
a
case
to
us
in
a
form
were
we
should
decide
whether
the
ninth
circuit
rule
is
right
or
wrong
instead
of
trying
to
limit
it
in
this
way
that
you
have
been
trying
to
do?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
do
you
--
why
do
you
tells
us
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
narrow
us
down?
why
--
why
isn't
a
man
entitled?
do
you
want
the
judge
to
say
or
if
he
does
come
in
now
and
say,
“well,
i
want
an
appeal
in
these
grounds.
have
the
judge
pass
on
its
own
actions.”
and
say,
“no
it
isn't
good
enough,
you
can't
appeal.”
why
isn't
he
entitled
to
an
appeal?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
now
i
didn't
understand
that
you
agreed
that
this
case
should
go
back
and
he
should
be
granted
an
appeal.
i
thought
you
said
he
should
go
back
and
have
affidavit
signed
by
himself,
and
counter-affidavits
filed
by
counsel
and
so
forth
and
then
have
the
judge
determine
whether
or
not
this
was
a
notice
of
appeal.
chief
justice
earl
warren
there
were
somebody
was
obviously
derelict,
who
was
it?
was
it
the
petitioner?
was
it
the
lawyer?
or
was
it
the
judge?
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
it
the
judge?
or
was
it
the
court
of
appeals?
somebody
has
been
derelict
here.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
ms.
rosenberg
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
--
do
we
have
nothing
like
that
in
this
case?
there's
nothing
been
said
like
that
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
isn't
that
the
issue
that's
here
right
now?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
we
have
to
convict
counsel
or
do
we
have
to
interpret
what
he
said
to
the
court?
and
determine
how
the
court
understood
what
the
counsel
said?
isn't
that
what
we're
after
here
rather
than
to
try
a
lawyer?
we're
not
trying
any
lawyer.
this
man
made
a
motion
in
court
and
he
mentioned
that
the
defendant
wanted
to
go
ahead
in
forma
pauperis.
and
the
court
twice
on
subsequent
proceedings
has
considered
that
as
an
oral
notice
of
appeal
and
two
different
panels
of
the
court
of
appeals
has
interpreted
that
in
the
same
way.
now,
why
do
you
say
to
us
that
we
shouldn't
interpret
it
that
way
for
the
purpose
of
determining
whether
this
man
gave
notice
of
appeal?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
something
went
on?
its
--
it
demonstrate
in
court
from
what
counsel
read?
chief
justice
earl
warren
at
sentencing,
his
counsel
said
that
he
wanted
--
this
man
want
to
proceed
in
forma
pauperis
and
the
court
interpreted
that
evidently
as
an
abandonment
of
the
client
and
the
desire
from
that
moment
for
him
to
proceed
in
forma
pauperis.
and
within
30
days
or
shortly
after
30
days,
the
defendant
was
trying
to
get
into
the
courts
and
what
more
--
what
more
do
we
need
when
the
courts
have
interpreted
the
way
--
below
the
way
they
have.
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
know
for
well
that
if
this
case
goes
back
and
counsel
said
that,
“no,
i
didn't,
i
didn't
tell
him
i
would
appeal.
what
i
said
in
court
was
what
i
meant.”
you
know
that
the
court
is
not
going
to
believe
rodriquez
as
against
the
practicing
lawyer
in
the
city,
don't
you?
so
he's
denied
the
right
of
appeal
and
inspite
of
the
fact
that
the
courts
below
and
all
these
occasions
have
said
that
except
for
the
fact
that
he
didn't
delineate.
the
--
what
his
rights
--
what
his
cause
of
appeal
was
that
he
couldn't
appeal?
that's
the
issue
they
decided
not
until
you
didn't
give
or
a
notice
of
appeal
but
that
he
didn't
give
the
reasons
why
he
was
appealing
and
they
say
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
because
of
that
and
because
of
our
rule,
he
can't
have
an
appeal.
now,
why
can't
--
why
can't
we
say
if
you
don't
--
if
you
don't
abide
by
that
ninth
circuit
rule
ms.
rosenberg.
why
can't
we
say
that
the
ninth
circuit
rule
is
wrong?
that
the
man
did
give
an
oral
notice
of
appeal
in
the
courtroom
that
his
counsel
abandoned
there
and
left
him
to
in
forma
pauperis
and
that
he
didn't
have
to
in
those
circumstances
delineate
the
issues
that
he
intended
to
raise
and
decide
the
case
in
that
matter,
in
as
much
as
two
courts
of
appeals
have
done
it
and
the
district
court
twice.
now,
what
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
wallace,
and
you
are
going
to
finish
your
time.
