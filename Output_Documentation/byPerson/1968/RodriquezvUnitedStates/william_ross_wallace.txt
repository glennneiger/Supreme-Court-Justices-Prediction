mr.
william
ross
wallace
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
case
that
comes
up
on
a
petition
under
section
2255,
a
federal
prisoner
who
claims
that
he
was
in
improperly
denied
his
right
of
appeal.
his
petition
alleges
that
he
is
a
mexican
descent
and
did
not
speak
the
language
well.
the
trial
was
conducted
through
an
interpreter
at
the
conclusion
of
the
trial
and
at
the
time
--
after
the
time
of
sentence,
the
prisoner
alleged
that
he
requested
the
interpreter
to
ask
the
court
and
to
ask
his
counsel
to
arrange
for
his
appeal.
he
also
alleges
that
his
counsel
agreed
to
do
so
and
that
an
oral
notice
of
appeal
if
there
is
such
a
thing
was
given
but
no
written
notice
conferring
to
the
statute
was
filed.
the
prisoner
originally
and
within
six
or
seven
weeks
at
the
time
of
the
sentence
filed
what
i
suppose
you
would
call
an
application
for
a
late
appeal.
that
was
denied
by
judge
macbride,
the
district
judge
in
sacramento,
and
by
the
circuit
court
of
the
ninth
circuit.
upon
the
grounds
that
under
the
rule
of
the
ninth
circuit,
an
application
for
a
right
of
appeal
late
where
a
prisoner
claimed
that
he
had
been
not
--
been
denied
that
right
of
appeal
must
also
show
some
basis
for
the
appeal.
in
other
words,
it
must
show
not
only
that
he
was
deprived
of
that
constitutional
right
but
he
must
show
that
he
have
something
upon
which
some
reasonable
basis
upon
which
to
appeal.
the
--
those
proceedings
were
in
1963.
in
1966,
the
prisoner
then
filed
an
application
under
section
2255
and
that
application
was
very
much
more
detailed
than
the
previous
ones.
so,
he
had
apparently
risen
in
the
hierarchy
of
the
jail
and
there
had
been
there
long
enough
to
learn
little
more
english
and
it
was
a
--
that
was
a
better
job
than
the
first
one.
there
again
and
without
hearing,
without
reference
to
the
transcript,
without
reference
to
his
counsel
and
without
reference
to
the
united
states
attorney,
judge
macbride
denied
that
application.
and
there
again,
he
was
--
he
then
filed
his
motion
to
have
the
appeal
heard
in
forma
pauperis
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
--
for
the
ninth
circuit.
the
court
again
without
hearing
denied
that
motion.
again
on
the
basis
of
the
rule
in
the
ninth
circuit
that
in
addition
to
showing
the
deprivation
of
the
right
to
appeal,
a
prisoner
must
show
something
more.
at
least
must
show
the
basis
of
an
appeal.
the
cases
in
california
in
our
circuit
are
not
wholly
clear
whether
he
has
to
show
conclusively
or
whether
he
has
--
they
talked
in
--
the
judge
here
talked
about
rights
constitutional
or
otherwise.
but
in
any
event,
it
is
clear
that
there
are
circuits
differing
from
most
of
the
circuits.
a
prisoner
claiming
his
deprivation
of
his
right
to
appeal
must
show
that
he,
if
granted
that
right,
has
at
least
a
reasonable
basis
upon
appeal.
now,
in
the
application
for
the
--
there
are
the
motion
or
application
for
the
writ
of
certiorari.
the
prisoner
set
forth
these
facts,
the
solicitor
general
in
his
opposition
felt
that
a
prisoner
should
at
least
show
something
that
would
indicate
some
basis
for
an
appeal.
in
our
opening
brief,
i
pointed
out
that
here
was
a
prisoner
of
mexican
descent
having
very
little
knowledge
of
the
language.
he
was
tried
with
five
--
four
or
five
other
people.
at
least
two
or
three
of
whom
had
separate
counsel.
the
whole
proceeding
was
conducted
through
an
interpreter
and
how
in
the
heaven's
name,
a
person
under
those
circumstances
would
be
able
to
recognize
and
remember
what
errors
occurred
at
the
trial
that
might
give
him
some
basis
for
an
appeal
seemed
to
me
an
impossibility.
i
think
in
the
solicitor's
brief,
they
have
in
effect
waived
that
point.
they
seem
not
to
rely
any
further
upon
the
--
on
the
basis
that
something
should
be
done
that
the
prisoner
must
do
--
to
show
something
beside
the
actual
deprivation
of
his
right
of
appeal.
the
brief
of
the
solicitor
for
the
united
states
in
this
case,
seems
to
have
waived
that
point
and
they
really
talking
about
whether
this
prisoner
should
now
have
a
hearing
or
whether
the
--
this
court
should
send
this
matter
back
to
the
district
court.
we
have
to
permit
the
district
court
to
interrogate
the
--
and
take
affidavits
from
the
trial
lawyer
that
this
man
have
or
whether
he
has
to
bring
the
prisoner
down
from
mcneil's
island.
we're
talking
i
think
now
only
of
mechanics.
now,
my
view
of
the
matter
and
i
think,
i
can
express
it
easily
is
that
if
we
take
the
rule
of
the
board
of
case
which
as
described
in
the
hannigan
simply
says
that,
a
prisoner
who
is
deprived
of
his
right
of
appeal
or
a
prisoner's
right
of
appeal
with
the
10-day
period
during
which
that
right
must
be
exercised
does
not
commence
to
run
until
such
period
as
the
prisoner
is
effectively
represented
by
counsel.
now,
after
our
original
brief,
i
obtained
from
the
court
reporter
in
sacramento
the
transcript
of
the
last
day
of
the
trial,
that
is
to
say
the
transcript
of
the
day
upon
which
this
prisoner
was
sentenced,
this
prisoner
and
the
others.
only
enough
that
transcript
showed
no
oral
notice
of
appeal.
although,
the
lower
court
and
the
circuit
court,
in
our
circuit,
had
both
said
it
was
there.
in
other
words,
we
have
a
judicial
finding
based
on
no
fact
whatever
and
obvious
result
of
not
even
looking
at
the
transcript.
however,
the
transcript
does
contain
a
very
much
more
important
in
--
on
page
3
of
the
appendix
to
my
reply
brief.
the
counsel
then
act
--
makes
a
motion
not
in
very
good
language
but
he
said,
it
is
just
proceeding
in
forma
pauperis
in
behalf
of
adolpho
rodriquez
and
etta
rodriquez
while
they
are
before
the
court.
hereafter,
pardon
me,
if
they
are
transported
away,
we
would
have
to
have
them
returned
to
make
a
motion
before
the
court.
judge
macbride
then
says,
no,
i
don't
wish
to
take
up
that
matter
at
this
--
that
motion
of
this
time.
its
five
minutes
after
12.
we've
taken
all
morning
on
it.
i
have
no
idea
what's
your
motion
is
and
all
motions
have
to
be
writing.
well,
it
was
clear
at
that
moment
that
the
counsel
who
had
been
retained
by
rodriquez
and
his
wife
for
the
trial
was
advising
that
court
that
he
was
stepping
out.
you
know
the
only
purpose
in
making
a
motion
of
that
sort
was
to
indicate
to
the
court
that
he
was
through
to
that
lawyer,
mr.
miley
was
finished
and
the
motion
for
--
to
proceed
in
forma
pauperis
could
only
mean
that
he
was
in
effect
suggesting
to
the
court
that
he
was
through
--
the
court
should
appoint
new
counsel
and
permit
the
man
to
appeal.
now,
section
37
(a),
the
rule
of
37
(a),
says
very
clearly
that
if
a
prisoner
is
not
represented
by
counsel
then
the
court
must
advice
him
of
his
right
to
appeal
and
the
clerk
must
enter
the
notice.
now,
it
was
--
it
would
have
been
perfectly
simple
to
have
accomplished
that
purpose
at
that
time.
now,
we're
five
or
six
years
later.
yes,
six
years
later,
he's
been
in
jail
for
six
years,
it
seems
to
me
perfectly
clear
that
on
the
basis
of
the
transcript.
the
court
can
well
then
state
that
the
prisoner's
right
to
appeal
commences,
at
such
time
as
the
court
in
sacramento
appoints
for
him
counsel
and
permits
him
then
to
enter
his
appeal.
now,
i
think
there
is
no
point
my
discussing
the
rule
in
the
ninth
circuit
where
i
think
because
of
their
desire
in
the
circuit
the
very
proper
one
to
prevent
repetitious
applications
under
section
2255.
they
laid
out
a
lot
of
rules.
i
think
the
lower
courts
misunderstood
that
that
case
somewhat
but
in
any
event,
while
i
can
only
agree
with
the
courts
in
their
desire
to
prevent
to
the
extent
they
can,
repetitious
petitions
under
section
2255
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
right
of
a
prisoner
to
be
secure
in
his
right
of
appeal.
now,
this
is
not
a
case
that
can
easily
arise
again
because
as
your
honors
well
know
under
the
change
of
rule
no
matter
whether
the
prisoner
is
represented
or
not
any
long.
the
court's
all
now
--
all
advise
him
of
his
right
of
appeal
and
if
counsel
is
not
going
to
take
it,
the
court
simply
instructs
the
clerk
to
enter
the
order.
so
that
we
are
talking
about
a
situation
that
certainly
is
not
one
that
plague
us
in
the
future.
this
is
a
simple
situation
of
a
man
having
very
little
knowledge
of
the
language
whose
trial
counsel
was
not
willing
apparently
proceed
pass
the
trial
who
attempted
to
make
clear
to
the
trial
court
that
he
was
withdrawing
and
whose
failure
and
i
think
in
a
very
serious
failure
on
the
part
of
counsel
was
that
he
fail
to
file
the
proper
motion
either
that
afternoon
or
on
the
following
day.
he
did
nothing
further
--
mr.
william
ross
wallace
well,
i
think
it
would
have
been
motion
your
honor
to
permit
the
prisoner
to
proceed
in
forma
pauperis
on
the
appeal
and
--
mr.
william
ross
wallace
--
it
would
have
meant,
i
think
also
the
appointment
by
the
court
of
counsel
for
the
prisoner.
mr.
william
ross
wallace
that
i
agree
your
honor.
now,
i
think
we
have
this
odd
situation
the
--
in
the
first
time
this
came
up
judge
macbride
said
in
his
first
opinion
that
the
prisoner
claimed
that
he
had
made
an
oral
notice
of
appeal.
the
case
then
went
up
before
judge
chambers
and
judge
bone
in
the
circuit
and
somehow
or
another
judge
bone,
i
think,
wrote
the
opinion.
judge
bone
said
the
right
that
notice
of
appeal,
oral
notice
of
appeal
was
given
by
retained
counsel.
that
was
the
basis
of
that
matter.
then
the
question
--
mr.
william
ross
wallace
i
don't
read
this
record
of
supporting.
mr.
william
ross
wallace
no,
then
it
came
down
again
before
on
the
section
2255
application
before
judge
macbride
and
judge
macbride
then
said
that
an
oral
notice
had
been
made.
it
goes
back
going
up
to
the
circuit
and
judge
jertberg
and
i
forgot
who
else
was
on
that
panel.
they
then
affirm
again
that
this
oral
notice
was
given.
i
can
find
the
oral
notice.
on
the
other
hand,
i
can
understand
perfectly
well
that
a
mexican
prisoner
would
think
that
this
motion
that
the
man
was
making
under
his
forma
pauperis
motion
was
just
that
and
obviously
it
was
intended
as
that.
now
--
mr.
william
ross
wallace
well,
it
can
have
no
other
purpose,
your
honor.
the
prisoner
to
appear
in
forma
pauperis,
if
he
is
just
go
on
to
the
jailhouse.
there's
no
purpose
of
his
having
the
motion
made
except
to
have
counsel
appointed
for
him
so
he
could
appeal
and
he
have
no
other
purpose.
otherwise,
he's
got
his
20
years
in
the
federal
prison.
it
seems
to
me
one
of
the
clearest
cases
that
i
know
of,
of
a
failure
for
whatever
reason
of
counsel
to
protect
the
right
of
his
client
to
appeal.
now,
i
can
understand
judge
macbride
had
been
a
long
five,
six
weeks
trial
conducted
through
interpreters
with
a
lot
of
lawyers
and
he
was
a
little
weary,
i
guess
himself
and
shot
the
man
off
before
he
had
completed
his
motion
now.
that
does
not
i
think
excuse
counsel,
his
retained
counsel
for
not
completing
that
motion
and
making
it
in
writing
and
making
it
wholly
clear.
on
the
other
hand,
it
seem
--
it
would
seem
to
me
an
extraordinary
thing
for
a
court
to
hold
that
the
prisoner
clearly
wanted
to
appeal.
he
has
alleged
in
all
these
papers
that
he
wanted
to
appeal.
there
has
been
no
denial
on
the
part
of
anybody
that
he
wanted
to
appeal.
he
was
denied
his
right
of
appeal
not
on
this
basis
of
this
motion
because
nobody
had
ever
seen
him
but
denied
it
only
on
the
basis
that
even
assuming
he
wanted
his
right
of
appeal
and
that
it
should
be
given
to
him.
he
must
show
in
addition
to
that
a
basis
upon
which
an
appeal
might
be
successful.
in
other
words,
in
our
circuit,
they
have
confused
the
constitutional
rights
provision
under
section
2255
with
the
right
of
direct
appeal.
they
have
--
they
have
taken
the
right
of
direct
appeal
if
it's
late
and
added
to
it
a
demand
that
a
prisoner
be
able
to
show
not
only
that
he
was
improperly
denied
of
his
right
of
appeal.
but
that
having
been
so
denied,
he
still
has
valid
grounds
for
an
appeal.
now,
of
course
that's
a
wholly
impossible
task
for
a
prisoner
in
this
situation
who
obviously
has
no
knowledge
of
law
on
to
--
for
him
now
to
try,
six
years
later
and
recall
what
happened
in
the
trial.
what
the
trial
errors
were
states
are
perfectly
impossible
situation.
it
seems
to
me
perfectly
clear
that
this
prisoner
should
be
granted
a
hearing.
i
don't
know
that
even
granting
a
hearing
is
necessary
but
at
least
that
i
would
think
would
be
the
minimum
that
the
prisoner
can
have
a
hearing
his
counsel
can
be
brought
in.
he
could
--
it
can
be
established.
the
--
the
facts
can
be
established.
the
record
is
available.
the
transcript
is
the
notes
at
least
are
available
and
the
united
states
attorney
is
available.
mr.
miley,
his
counsel
is
available.
it's
a
--
it
is
--
the
case
i
think
is
one
that
illustrates
with
better
than
most,
the
difficulties
that
arise
when
these
matters
are
handled
in
the
lower
courts
without
reference
to
counsel
and
without
reference
even
to
the
transcript.
it
is
obviously
here,
we've
got
an
off
on
to
a
--
on
a
basis
of
somebody's
recollection
when
five
minutes
work
in
reading
the
transcript
and
a
few
minutes
of
calling
mr.
miley
would
have
established
that
what
mr.
miley
was
saying
was,
i
have
represented
the
prisoner
at
the
trial.
i
am
not
going
to
represent
him
further
and
i
ask
the
court
to
avoid
counsel
to
do
so.
this
is
what
--
mr.
william
ross
wallace
i
have
no
idea.
now,
i
can
--
i
can
say
wholly
ex
parte
or
simply
discussing
this
matter
over
the
telephone
with
mr.
miley.
i
tried
to
get
in
two
or
three
times.
he's
a
very
busy
trial
lawyer
and
i
was
never
able
to
make
an
appointment.
he
told
me
that
he
thought
he
had
at
least
one
valid
ground
of
appeal
but
that
this
had
been
a
long
trial.
he
had
--
he
felt
not
been
compensated
as
he
should
have
been
and
that
he
was
not
going
to
take
the
thing
up
on
appeal
that
he
told
the
prisoner
he
would
not
take
it
up
on
appeal
for
him
but
that
he
would
arranged
it.
now,
the
prisoner
he
recalled
in
the
--
in
his
petition
says,
this
lawyer
said
he
would
arrange
it.
well,
in
arranging
it
was
this
--
this
forma
pauperis
business
but
he
failed
to
do
it.
so
i
think
we've
got
a
clear
case
where
the
prisoner
was
improperly
deprived
of
his
right.
the
right
is
an
absolute
right
that
in
the
absence
of
prisoner
knowledgeably
waiving
or
giving
up
that
right.
there
is
not
as
any
indication
here
that
this
prisoner
gave
up
any
right
to
appeal
knowingly.
there
is
every
indication
from
the
fact
that
the
prisoner
started
within
a
six
weeks,
a
few
days
after
the
30
days
went
by.
he
was
writing
out
the
first
somewhat
feeble
attempt
to
get
himself
an
appeal.
so,
it's
clear
he
wanted
a
deal
to
you.
there
has
--
it
is
clear
from
my
--
going
extra
record
for
my
discussion
with
mr.
miley,
the
prisoner
and
his
wife
wanted
to
appeal.
mr.
william
ross
wallace
the
petitioner
asked
me
and
wrote
to
me
and
asked
me
if
i
could
find
out
whether
his
wife
was
--
he
has
not
been
able
to
communicate
with
her.
i
think
he
said
since
1943
or
1944.
mr.
william
ross
wallace
she
was
convicted
and
sent
to
terminal
island
prison,
i
think,
in
southern
california.
he
asked
me
if
i
would
write
to
her
brother,
i
did
and
i
receive
no
reply.
i
have
not
tried
to
communicate
with
her
in
the
federal
prisoner
if
she
is
still
there.
mr.
william
ross
wallace
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
william
ross
wallace
that's
right.
mr.
william
ross
wallace
but
he
knows
--
has
no
knowledge
where
she
presently
is
and
she
may
for
what
i
know
still
be
in
the
prison
in
california.
thank
you.
mr.
william
ross
wallace
well,
i
think
--
i
think
i
can
finish
very
shortly.
i
should
--
i
should
like
to
address
myself
first
to
the
question
asked
by
mr.
justice
marshall.
i
think
it's
obvious
in
the
situation
of
this
kind
that
immediately
on
remand
counsel
must
be
appointed
before
the
prisoner.
i
don't
think
the
court
should
be
calling
in
a
former
lawyer
and
asking
him
to
make
an
affidavit
ex
parte
again.
i
think
the
ex
parte
business
is
--
we
have
too
much
of
that
in
this
case
already.
i
think
if
counsel
had
been
called
in
the
first
instance
and
the
united
states
attorney
called
in
the
first
instance,
we
wouldn't
be
here.
the
further
question
of
--
mr.
william
ross
wallace
well,
in
the
boruff
case,
in
the
fifth
circuit,
the
court
says,
we
think
it
is
not
unwarranted
construction
of
the
statute
of
rule
37
(a)
(2)
to
construe
the
works
defendant
not
represented
by
counsel.
to
mean
a
defendant
not
represented
by
counsel
during
the
10-day
period
after
which
failure
to
file
a
notice
of
appeal
would
forever
bar
such
a
right.
now
--
mr.
william
ross
wallace
i
would
think
so.
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
they
do.
mr.
william
ross
wallace
i
think
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
william
ross
wallace
no.
i'm
suggesting
this
court
should
not
do
so.
mr.
william
ross
wallace
well,
i
would
assume
your
honor
that
if
this
case
is
sent
back
to
the
district
court
and
the
rule
of
the
ninth
circuit
is
overruled
by
this
court
and
the
court
in
this
case
is
remanded
to
the
district
court
to
determine
whether
this
prisoner
has
a
right
of
appeal.
all
of
these
things
would
be
taken
care
off.
mr.
william
ross
wallace
that's
right.
i
only
suggest
the
thing
i
was
objecting
to
--
was
that
the
some
kind
of
proceeding
happened
before
the
court
held
a
hearing.
i
think
the
prisoners
entitled
to
be
present
or
at
least
he
is
entitled
to
have
counsel
and
then,
the
court
can
go
on
and
have
whatever
kind
of
an
investigatory
hearing
it
wants.
so
long
as
it
is
confined
only
to
the
question
of
this
man's
right
of
appeal
and
not
to
the
question
of
whether
his
appeal,
if
granted
would
be
a
good
one.
i
don't
think
that's
any
business
in
the
district
court.
thank
you.
mr.
william
ross
wallace
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
case
that
comes
up
on
a
petition
under
section
2255,
a
federal
prisoner
who
claims
that
he
was
in
improperly
denied
his
right
of
appeal.
his
petition
alleges
that
he
is
a
mexican
descent
and
did
not
speak
the
language
well.
the
trial
was
conducted
through
an
interpreter
at
the
conclusion
of
the
trial
and
at
the
time
--
after
the
time
of
sentence,
the
prisoner
alleged
that
he
requested
the
interpreter
to
ask
the
court
and
to
ask
his
counsel
to
arrange
for
his
appeal.
he
also
alleges
that
his
counsel
agreed
to
do
so
and
that
an
oral
notice
of
appeal
if
there
is
such
a
thing
was
given
but
no
written
notice
conferring
to
the
statute
was
filed.
the
prisoner
originally
and
within
six
or
seven
weeks
at
the
time
of
the
sentence
filed
what
i
suppose
you
would
call
an
application
for
a
late
appeal.
that
was
denied
by
judge
macbride,
the
district
judge
in
sacramento,
and
by
the
circuit
court
of
the
ninth
circuit.
upon
the
grounds
that
under
the
rule
of
the
ninth
circuit,
an
application
for
a
right
of
appeal
late
where
a
prisoner
claimed
that
he
had
been
not
--
been
denied
that
right
of
appeal
must
also
show
some
basis
for
the
appeal.
in
other
words,
it
must
show
not
only
that
he
was
deprived
of
that
constitutional
right
but
he
must
show
that
he
have
something
upon
which
some
reasonable
basis
upon
which
to
appeal.
the
--
those
proceedings
were
in
1963.
in
1966,
the
prisoner
then
filed
an
application
under
section
2255
and
that
application
was
very
much
more
detailed
than
the
previous
ones.
so,
he
had
apparently
risen
in
the
hierarchy
of
the
jail
and
there
had
been
there
long
enough
to
learn
little
more
english
and
it
was
a
--
that
was
a
better
job
than
the
first
one.
there
again
and
without
hearing,
without
reference
to
the
transcript,
without
reference
to
his
counsel
and
without
reference
to
the
united
states
attorney,
judge
macbride
denied
that
application.
and
there
again,
he
was
--
he
then
filed
his
motion
to
have
the
appeal
heard
in
forma
pauperis
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
--
for
the
ninth
circuit.
the
court
again
without
hearing
denied
that
motion.
again
on
the
basis
of
the
rule
in
the
ninth
circuit
that
in
addition
to
showing
the
deprivation
of
the
right
to
appeal,
a
prisoner
must
show
something
more.
at
least
must
show
the
basis
of
an
appeal.
the
cases
in
california
in
our
circuit
are
not
wholly
clear
whether
he
has
to
show
conclusively
or
whether
he
has
--
they
talked
in
--
the
judge
here
talked
about
rights
constitutional
or
otherwise.
but
in
any
event,
it
is
clear
that
there
are
circuits
differing
from
most
of
the
circuits.
a
prisoner
claiming
his
deprivation
of
his
right
to
appeal
must
show
that
he,
if
granted
that
right,
has
at
least
a
reasonable
basis
upon
appeal.
now,
in
the
application
for
the
--
there
are
the
motion
or
application
for
the
writ
of
certiorari.
the
prisoner
set
forth
these
facts,
the
solicitor
general
in
his
opposition
felt
that
a
prisoner
should
at
least
show
something
that
would
indicate
some
basis
for
an
appeal.
in
our
opening
brief,
i
pointed
out
that
here
was
a
prisoner
of
mexican
descent
having
very
little
knowledge
of
the
language.
he
was
tried
with
five
--
four
or
five
other
people.
at
least
two
or
three
of
whom
had
separate
counsel.
the
whole
proceeding
was
conducted
through
an
interpreter
and
how
in
the
heaven's
name,
a
person
under
those
circumstances
would
be
able
to
recognize
and
remember
what
errors
occurred
at
the
trial
that
might
give
him
some
basis
for
an
appeal
seemed
to
me
an
impossibility.
i
think
in
the
solicitor's
brief,
they
have
in
effect
waived
that
point.
they
seem
not
to
rely
any
further
upon
the
--
on
the
basis
that
something
should
be
done
that
the
prisoner
must
do
--
to
show
something
beside
the
actual
deprivation
of
his
right
of
appeal.
the
brief
of
the
solicitor
for
the
united
states
in
this
case,
seems
to
have
waived
that
point
and
they
really
talking
about
whether
this
prisoner
should
now
have
a
hearing
or
whether
the
--
this
court
should
send
this
matter
back
to
the
district
court.
we
have
to
permit
the
district
court
to
interrogate
the
--
and
take
affidavits
from
the
trial
lawyer
that
this
man
have
or
whether
he
has
to
bring
the
prisoner
down
from
mcneil's
island.
we're
talking
i
think
now
only
of
mechanics.
now,
my
view
of
the
matter
and
i
think,
i
can
express
it
easily
is
that
if
we
take
the
rule
of
the
board
of
case
which
as
described
in
the
hannigan
simply
says
that,
a
prisoner
who
is
deprived
of
his
right
of
appeal
or
a
prisoner's
right
of
appeal
with
the
10-day
period
during
which
that
right
must
be
exercised
does
not
commence
to
run
until
such
period
as
the
prisoner
is
effectively
represented
by
counsel.
now,
after
our
original
brief,
i
obtained
from
the
court
reporter
in
sacramento
the
transcript
of
the
last
day
of
the
trial,
that
is
to
say
the
transcript
of
the
day
upon
which
this
prisoner
was
sentenced,
this
prisoner
and
the
others.
only
enough
that
transcript
showed
no
oral
notice
of
appeal.
although,
the
lower
court
and
the
circuit
court,
in
our
circuit,
had
both
said
it
was
there.
in
other
words,
we
have
a
judicial
finding
based
on
no
fact
whatever
and
obvious
result
of
not
even
looking
at
the
transcript.
however,
the
transcript
does
contain
a
very
much
more
important
in
--
on
page
3
of
the
appendix
to
my
reply
brief.
the
counsel
then
act
--
makes
a
motion
not
in
very
good
language
but
he
said,
it
is
just
proceeding
in
forma
pauperis
in
behalf
of
adolpho
rodriquez
and
etta
rodriquez
while
they
are
before
the
court.
hereafter,
pardon
me,
if
they
are
transported
away,
we
would
have
to
have
them
returned
to
make
a
motion
before
the
court.
judge
macbride
then
says,
no,
i
don't
wish
to
take
up
that
matter
at
this
--
that
motion
of
this
time.
its
five
minutes
after
12.
we've
taken
all
morning
on
it.
i
have
no
idea
what's
your
motion
is
and
all
motions
have
to
be
writing.
well,
it
was
clear
at
that
moment
that
the
counsel
who
had
been
retained
by
rodriquez
and
his
wife
for
the
trial
was
advising
that
court
that
he
was
stepping
out.
you
know
the
only
purpose
in
making
a
motion
of
that
sort
was
to
indicate
to
the
court
that
he
was
through
to
that
lawyer,
mr.
miley
was
finished
and
the
motion
for
--
to
proceed
in
forma
pauperis
could
only
mean
that
he
was
in
effect
suggesting
to
the
court
that
he
was
through
--
the
court
should
appoint
new
counsel
and
permit
the
man
to
appeal.
now,
section
37
(a),
the
rule
of
37
(a),
says
very
clearly
that
if
a
prisoner
is
not
represented
by
counsel
then
the
court
must
advice
him
of
his
right
to
appeal
and
the
clerk
must
enter
the
notice.
now,
it
was
--
it
would
have
been
perfectly
simple
to
have
accomplished
that
purpose
at
that
time.
now,
we're
five
or
six
years
later.
yes,
six
years
later,
he's
been
in
jail
for
six
years,
it
seems
to
me
perfectly
clear
that
on
the
basis
of
the
transcript.
the
court
can
well
then
state
that
the
prisoner's
right
to
appeal
commences,
at
such
time
as
the
court
in
sacramento
appoints
for
him
counsel
and
permits
him
then
to
enter
his
appeal.
now,
i
think
there
is
no
point
my
discussing
the
rule
in
the
ninth
circuit
where
i
think
because
of
their
desire
in
the
circuit
the
very
proper
one
to
prevent
repetitious
applications
under
section
2255.
they
laid
out
a
lot
of
rules.
i
think
the
lower
courts
misunderstood
that
that
case
somewhat
but
in
any
event,
while
i
can
only
agree
with
the
courts
in
their
desire
to
prevent
to
the
extent
they
can,
repetitious
petitions
under
section
2255
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
right
of
a
prisoner
to
be
secure
in
his
right
of
appeal.
now,
this
is
not
a
case
that
can
easily
arise
again
because
as
your
honors
well
know
under
the
change
of
rule
no
matter
whether
the
prisoner
is
represented
or
not
any
long.
the
court's
all
now
--
all
advise
him
of
his
right
of
appeal
and
if
counsel
is
not
going
to
take
it,
the
court
simply
instructs
the
clerk
to
enter
the
order.
so
that
we
are
talking
about
a
situation
that
certainly
is
not
one
that
plague
us
in
the
future.
this
is
a
simple
situation
of
a
man
having
very
little
knowledge
of
the
language
whose
trial
counsel
was
not
willing
apparently
proceed
pass
the
trial
who
attempted
to
make
clear
to
the
trial
court
that
he
was
withdrawing
and
whose
failure
and
i
think
in
a
very
serious
failure
on
the
part
of
counsel
was
that
he
fail
to
file
the
proper
motion
either
that
afternoon
or
on
the
following
day.
he
did
nothing
further
--
mr.
william
ross
wallace
well,
i
think
it
would
have
been
motion
your
honor
to
permit
the
prisoner
to
proceed
in
forma
pauperis
on
the
appeal
and
--
mr.
william
ross
wallace
--
it
would
have
meant,
i
think
also
the
appointment
by
the
court
of
counsel
for
the
prisoner.
mr.
william
ross
wallace
that
i
agree
your
honor.
now,
i
think
we
have
this
odd
situation
the
--
in
the
first
time
this
came
up
judge
macbride
said
in
his
first
opinion
that
the
prisoner
claimed
that
he
had
made
an
oral
notice
of
appeal.
the
case
then
went
up
before
judge
chambers
and
judge
bone
in
the
circuit
and
somehow
or
another
judge
bone,
i
think,
wrote
the
opinion.
judge
bone
said
the
right
that
notice
of
appeal,
oral
notice
of
appeal
was
given
by
retained
counsel.
that
was
the
basis
of
that
matter.
then
the
question
--
mr.
william
ross
wallace
i
don't
read
this
record
of
supporting.
mr.
william
ross
wallace
no,
then
it
came
down
again
before
on
the
section
2255
application
before
judge
macbride
and
judge
macbride
then
said
that
an
oral
notice
had
been
made.
it
goes
back
going
up
to
the
circuit
and
judge
jertberg
and
i
forgot
who
else
was
on
that
panel.
they
then
affirm
again
that
this
oral
notice
was
given.
i
can
find
the
oral
notice.
on
the
other
hand,
i
can
understand
perfectly
well
that
a
mexican
prisoner
would
think
that
this
motion
that
the
man
was
making
under
his
forma
pauperis
motion
was
just
that
and
obviously
it
was
intended
as
that.
now
--
mr.
william
ross
wallace
well,
it
can
have
no
other
purpose,
your
honor.
the
prisoner
to
appear
in
forma
pauperis,
if
he
is
just
go
on
to
the
jailhouse.
there's
no
purpose
of
his
having
the
motion
made
except
to
have
counsel
appointed
for
him
so
he
could
appeal
and
he
have
no
other
purpose.
otherwise,
he's
got
his
20
years
in
the
federal
prison.
it
seems
to
me
one
of
the
clearest
cases
that
i
know
of,
of
a
failure
for
whatever
reason
of
counsel
to
protect
the
right
of
his
client
to
appeal.
now,
i
can
understand
judge
macbride
had
been
a
long
five,
six
weeks
trial
conducted
through
interpreters
with
a
lot
of
lawyers
and
he
was
a
little
weary,
i
guess
himself
and
shot
the
man
off
before
he
had
completed
his
motion
now.
that
does
not
i
think
excuse
counsel,
his
retained
counsel
for
not
completing
that
motion
and
making
it
in
writing
and
making
it
wholly
clear.
on
the
other
hand,
it
seem
--
it
would
seem
to
me
an
extraordinary
thing
for
a
court
to
hold
that
the
prisoner
clearly
wanted
to
appeal.
he
has
alleged
in
all
these
papers
that
he
wanted
to
appeal.
there
has
been
no
denial
on
the
part
of
anybody
that
he
wanted
to
appeal.
he
was
denied
his
right
of
appeal
not
on
this
basis
of
this
motion
because
nobody
had
ever
seen
him
but
denied
it
only
on
the
basis
that
even
assuming
he
wanted
his
right
of
appeal
and
that
it
should
be
given
to
him.
he
must
show
in
addition
to
that
a
basis
upon
which
an
appeal
might
be
successful.
in
other
words,
in
our
circuit,
they
have
confused
the
constitutional
rights
provision
under
section
2255
with
the
right
of
direct
appeal.
they
have
--
they
have
taken
the
right
of
direct
appeal
if
it's
late
and
added
to
it
a
demand
that
a
prisoner
be
able
to
show
not
only
that
he
was
improperly
denied
of
his
right
of
appeal.
but
that
having
been
so
denied,
he
still
has
valid
grounds
for
an
appeal.
now,
of
course
that's
a
wholly
impossible
task
for
a
prisoner
in
this
situation
who
obviously
has
no
knowledge
of
law
on
to
--
for
him
now
to
try,
six
years
later
and
recall
what
happened
in
the
trial.
what
the
trial
errors
were
states
are
perfectly
impossible
situation.
it
seems
to
me
perfectly
clear
that
this
prisoner
should
be
granted
a
hearing.
i
don't
know
that
even
granting
a
hearing
is
necessary
but
at
least
that
i
would
think
would
be
the
minimum
that
the
prisoner
can
have
a
hearing
his
counsel
can
be
brought
in.
he
could
--
it
can
be
established.
the
--
the
facts
can
be
established.
the
record
is
available.
the
transcript
is
the
notes
at
least
are
available
and
the
united
states
attorney
is
available.
mr.
miley,
his
counsel
is
available.
it's
a
--
it
is
--
the
case
i
think
is
one
that
illustrates
with
better
than
most,
the
difficulties
that
arise
when
these
matters
are
handled
in
the
lower
courts
without
reference
to
counsel
and
without
reference
even
to
the
transcript.
it
is
obviously
here,
we've
got
an
off
on
to
a
--
on
a
basis
of
somebody's
recollection
when
five
minutes
work
in
reading
the
transcript
and
a
few
minutes
of
calling
mr.
miley
would
have
established
that
what
mr.
miley
was
saying
was,
i
have
represented
the
prisoner
at
the
trial.
i
am
not
going
to
represent
him
further
and
i
ask
the
court
to
avoid
counsel
to
do
so.
this
is
what
--
mr.
william
ross
wallace
i
have
no
idea.
now,
i
can
--
i
can
say
wholly
ex
parte
or
simply
discussing
this
matter
over
the
telephone
with
mr.
miley.
i
tried
to
get
in
two
or
three
times.
he's
a
very
busy
trial
lawyer
and
i
was
never
able
to
make
an
appointment.
he
told
me
that
he
thought
he
had
at
least
one
valid
ground
of
appeal
but
that
this
had
been
a
long
trial.
he
had
--
he
felt
not
been
compensated
as
he
should
have
been
and
that
he
was
not
going
to
take
the
thing
up
on
appeal
that
he
told
the
prisoner
he
would
not
take
it
up
on
appeal
for
him
but
that
he
would
arranged
it.
now,
the
prisoner
he
recalled
in
the
--
in
his
petition
says,
this
lawyer
said
he
would
arrange
it.
well,
in
arranging
it
was
this
--
this
forma
pauperis
business
but
he
failed
to
do
it.
so
i
think
we've
got
a
clear
case
where
the
prisoner
was
improperly
deprived
of
his
right.
the
right
is
an
absolute
right
that
in
the
absence
of
prisoner
knowledgeably
waiving
or
giving
up
that
right.
there
is
not
as
any
indication
here
that
this
prisoner
gave
up
any
right
to
appeal
knowingly.
there
is
every
indication
from
the
fact
that
the
prisoner
started
within
a
six
weeks,
a
few
days
after
the
30
days
went
by.
he
was
writing
out
the
first
somewhat
feeble
attempt
to
get
himself
an
appeal.
so,
it's
clear
he
wanted
a
deal
to
you.
there
has
--
it
is
clear
from
my
--
going
extra
record
for
my
discussion
with
mr.
miley,
the
prisoner
and
his
wife
wanted
to
appeal.
mr.
william
ross
wallace
the
petitioner
asked
me
and
wrote
to
me
and
asked
me
if
i
could
find
out
whether
his
wife
was
--
he
has
not
been
able
to
communicate
with
her.
i
think
he
said
since
1943
or
1944.
mr.
william
ross
wallace
she
was
convicted
and
sent
to
terminal
island
prison,
i
think,
in
southern
california.
he
asked
me
if
i
would
write
to
her
brother,
i
did
and
i
receive
no
reply.
i
have
not
tried
to
communicate
with
her
in
the
federal
prisoner
if
she
is
still
there.
mr.
william
ross
wallace
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
william
ross
wallace
that's
right.
mr.
william
ross
wallace
but
he
knows
--
has
no
knowledge
where
she
presently
is
and
she
may
for
what
i
know
still
be
in
the
prison
in
california.
thank
you.
mr.
william
ross
wallace
well,
i
think
--
i
think
i
can
finish
very
shortly.
i
should
--
i
should
like
to
address
myself
first
to
the
question
asked
by
mr.
justice
marshall.
i
think
it's
obvious
in
the
situation
of
this
kind
that
immediately
on
remand
counsel
must
be
appointed
before
the
prisoner.
i
don't
think
the
court
should
be
calling
in
a
former
lawyer
and
asking
him
to
make
an
affidavit
ex
parte
again.
i
think
the
ex
parte
business
is
--
we
have
too
much
of
that
in
this
case
already.
i
think
if
counsel
had
been
called
in
the
first
instance
and
the
united
states
attorney
called
in
the
first
instance,
we
wouldn't
be
here.
the
further
question
of
--
mr.
william
ross
wallace
well,
in
the
boruff
case,
in
the
fifth
circuit,
the
court
says,
we
think
it
is
not
unwarranted
construction
of
the
statute
of
rule
37
(a)
(2)
to
construe
the
works
defendant
not
represented
by
counsel.
to
mean
a
defendant
not
represented
by
counsel
during
the
10-day
period
after
which
failure
to
file
a
notice
of
appeal
would
forever
bar
such
a
right.
now
--
mr.
william
ross
wallace
i
would
think
so.
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
they
do.
mr.
william
ross
wallace
i
think
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
william
ross
wallace
no.
i'm
suggesting
this
court
should
not
do
so.
mr.
william
ross
wallace
well,
i
would
assume
your
honor
that
if
this
case
is
sent
back
to
the
district
court
and
the
rule
of
the
ninth
circuit
is
overruled
by
this
court
and
the
court
in
this
case
is
remanded
to
the
district
court
to
determine
whether
this
prisoner
has
a
right
of
appeal.
all
of
these
things
would
be
taken
care
off.
mr.
william
ross
wallace
that's
right.
i
only
suggest
the
thing
i
was
objecting
to
--
was
that
the
some
kind
of
proceeding
happened
before
the
court
held
a
hearing.
i
think
the
prisoners
entitled
to
be
present
or
at
least
he
is
entitled
to
have
counsel
and
then,
the
court
can
go
on
and
have
whatever
kind
of
an
investigatory
hearing
it
wants.
so
long
as
it
is
confined
only
to
the
question
of
this
man's
right
of
appeal
and
not
to
the
question
of
whether
his
appeal,
if
granted
would
be
a
good
one.
i
don't
think
that's
any
business
in
the
district
court.
thank
you.
