place
along
the
line
that

consider
in

a
lawyer?
justice

when

ever
does
the

what
my
problem
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
my
problem
is,
if
i
understand
you
correctly,
that
in
this
very
case,
once
this
petitioner
had
a
lawyer.
the
lawyer
was
able
to
say
it
properly
so
that
you
admit
that
if
that
had
been
found
in
the
district
court
it
would
had
to
been
heard.
justice
thurgood
marshall
doesn't
that
mean
that
when
he
gets
back
to
the
district
court
he
has
to
have
a
lawyer?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
the
one.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
he
can't
have
that
one
in
court
because
he's
still
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
in
prison.
