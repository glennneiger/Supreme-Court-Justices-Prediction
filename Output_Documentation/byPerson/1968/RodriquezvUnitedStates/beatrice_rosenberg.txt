ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
may
it
please
the
court.
there
really
is
a
very
narrow,
almost
no
disagreement
with
between
the
petitioner
and
the
government
in
this
case.
the
case
is
not
quite
clear
and
quite
general
throughout
the
court
that
there
are
two
situations
which
do
call
for
some
relief
on
that
collateral
remedy
where
a
prisoner
claims
that
he
is
been
denied
of
right
of
appeal.
one
is
where
his
counsel
has
not
told
him
anything
about
his
rights
of
appeal
and
has
abandoned
him.
and
the
other
is,
if
counsel
has
been
guilty
of
what
courts
sometimes
called
fraud
but
which
if
you
look
at
the
case,
this
amount
to
over
reaching
and
it
doesn't
seem
to
be
any
conflict
on
proposition.
that
if
a
counsel
assures
a
defendant
that
he
will
take
care
of
his
appeal
and
then
deliberately
does
nothing,
not
just
it.
besides
that
this
is
a
basis
for
collateral
relief
with
ninth
circuit
and
possibly
to
other
circuits.
although,
their
decisions
are
not
wholly
clear
have
been
different
where
there
has
been
a
conflict
is
on
the
question
of
whether
in
addition
to
alleging
a
deprivation
of
right
to
appeal.
the
prisoner
has
to
show
that
it
was
some
basis
of
appeal
and
the
ninth
circuit
when
its
--
insisted
on
this
requirement.
we
understand
what
there
were
trying
to
do
which
is
try
to
shift
the
weak
the
good
case
and
the
bad
one
and
we
assume
that
if
a
man
had
a
good
point
on
appeal,
it
would
tend
to
both
to
his
contention
that
counsel
deliberately
didn't
do
it.
however
on
reflection,
we
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
we
can't
support
that
as
a
requirement
for
requiring
action
in
the
district
court
and
the
reason
for
that
is
that
--
it
seems
to
us
not
wholly
continent
with
the
real
remedy
that
you're
trying
to
get
at.
what
you
--
what
collateral
relief
was
primarily,
originally
designed
to
do
was
to
take
care
of
the
person
who
got
caught
in
the
coils
of
the
law
either
the
judge
or
the
prosecution
of
his
own
attorney.
and
it
seems
to
us
that
the
--
those
who
are
most
likely
to
abuse
the
writ.
that
really
kind
of
make
up
stories
if
we
do
encounter
could
meet
the
ninth
that
a
requirement
with
no
difficulty.
but
the
truly
honest,
ignorant
person
who
had
been
overreached
by
unscrupulous
lawyer
would
find
that
the
most
difficult
to
specify
whether
there
was
legal
error
in
his
trial
and
for
that
reason,
we
do
not
urge
the
ninth
circuit
rule.
but
since
the
case
is
here,
we
do
think
there
are
some
things
this
court
could
help
clarify
with
respect
to
this
kind
of
a
claim
or
perhaps
even
more
generally
with
respect
to
this
question
of,
what
does
a
judge
do
when
he
gets
an
allegation
of
this
kind?
i
think
no
one
who
has
had
experience
with
them
can
feel
to
appreciate
the
fact
that
a
lot
of
these
are
simply
not
true
and
the
result
wishful
thinking.
on
the
other
hand,
there
are
some
that
are.
we
have
agreed
that
if
what
this
petitioner
alleges
in
his
petition
for
a
writ
of
certiorari
which
is
must
more
detailed
and
much
more
specific
then
his
allegations
in
the
district
court.
we
have
agreed
that
if
--
what
he
alleges
in
a
petition
for
certiorari,
were
alleged
to
the
district
court.
the
district
court
would
have
to
do
something.
we
find
a
little
difficult
to
fool
the
district
court
on
that
acting
on
what
it
had
before
it
that.
but
even
aside
--
its
true
the
district
court
rested
on
the
ninth
circuit
rule
which
were
not
defending
but
even
on
the
petition
in
the
district
court.
it
seems
to
us
the
petition
is
not
specific
enough
as
petition
for
certiorari
is
to
require
action
and
we
think
that's
different.
we
think
he
have
a
right
to
require
specific
allegations
in
a
district
court
about
what
went
on
with
his
lawyer.
you
can't
expect
an
ignorant
prisoner
to
know
where
there
is
legal
error
to
track
but
he
can
know
what
went
on
with
his
lawyer.
now
in
this
--
in
the
petition,
just
--
he
alleges
something
which
is
fairly
consistent
with
what?
petitioner's
counsel
says,
he
has
discovered
ex
parte.
he
says,
that
he
asked
the
attorney
to
take
an
oral
notice
of
appeal.
no,
he
has
his
attorney
to
appeal
and
a
petitioner's
trial
counsel
gave
oral
notice
of
appeal.
i
assumed
he
considered
this
rather
cryptic
motion
to
be
an
oral
notice
of
appeal.
and
then
he
says,
petitioner's
wife
where
then
placed
in
a
room
to
await
transportation
back
to
the
county
jail
and
that
one
of
his
other
papers
in
the
record,
he
said,
he
was
held
in
the
county
jail
for
30
days.
but
at
this
point,
he
says,
while
they
were
waiting,
petitioner's
trial
counsel
came
to
take
petitioner's
wife
and
told
them
he
would
arrange
for
their
cases
to
be
appealed.
now
that
is
a
part
that's
--
we
don't
know
what
happened
there,
that's
after
this
hearing.
whatever
went
on
there
and
whether
it
is
true
or
not.
i
have
no
way
of
knowing
but
we
agreed
that
if
that
allegation,
that
counsel
said
he
would
arranged
all
the
cases
to
be
appealed
which
appears
only
in
petition
for
certiorari
it
made
to
the
district
court
would
call
for
some
action.
but
the
question
is
what
action?
and
i
think
that
this
is
important
not
only
in
these
situations
which
we
hope
full
of
rise
rarely
in
view
of
the
new
rules.
but
even
more
basically,
generally
in
2255
when
you
get
allegations
often
made
out
of
whole
cloth.
what
is
the
judge
do?
and
it
seems
to
me
that
these
--
this
court's
decisions
in
both
walker
against
johnston
in
312
united
states
and
in
machibroda
have
been
misunderstood.
in
both
of
those
cases,
there
were
responsive
affidavits
filed
and
the
court
held
on
the
basis
of
those
responsive
affidavits
where
one
side
said
“x”
and
the
other
side
said
exactly
the
opposite.
that
the
court
could
not
decide
the
matter
on
affidavits
that
there
had
to
be
a
hearing.
and
i
think
there
has
been
a
tendency
as
to
result
to
that
to
consider
that
affidavits
had
no
part
at
all
in
a
2255
application.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
machibroda,
your
honor.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
and
before
that
walker
against
johnston.
although
in
both
those
cases,
there
were
affidavits.
now
what
the
court
said
is
i
revoke
those
cases
is,
these
affidavits
present
a
clear
cut
conflict
of
testimony
and
we
have
something
as
clear
cut
as
that
it
has
to
be
resolve
to
the
hearing.
i
presumed
that
if
a
lawyer
in
this
case
said,
i
did
not
arrange
--
i
did
not
tell
the
defendants,
i
would
arrange
for
their
appeal.
and
defendants
said,
he
did
--
there
might
be
of
necessity
hearing
except
for
what
i
am
going
to
say
next
because
i
don't
think
that's
enough.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
first
thing
you
do
in
2255
generally
and
certainly
in
this
situation
is
to
try
to
get
the
--
a
responsive
pleading
in
one
from
one
to
another.
now,
this
court
just
last
monday
in
the
harris
case
talked
about
flexibility
of
procedures.
i
don't
think
it
has
to
be
a
formal
responsive
pleading
like
the
old
return
in
habeas
corpus
because
that
wouldn't
be
meaningful
but
what
you
do
want
is
to
get
something
in
the
form
--
in
the
record
which
seems
to
me
would
most
easily
take
the
form
of
an
affidavit.
getting
from
in
this
case,
the
attorney
since
the
government
has
no
part
of
all
these.
this
was
retained
counsel
and
knew
--
the
government
obviously
knew
nothing
that
went
on
here.
get
from
the
attorney
a
response.
now,
i
can
conceive
of
several
responses
which
might
settle
the
whole
question
one
way
or
another.
for
example,
if
the
attorney
says,
he
did
tell
me
he
would
like
to
appeal.
and
i
said
i
didn't
feel
that
i
could
do
it
for
less
than
“x”
dollars
and
that
i
did
not
feel
that
was
part
of
my
obligation
to
tell
him
anything
about
his
rights
in
forma
pauperis.
why?
because
we
don't
have
to
have
a
hearing,
we
just
go
ahead
with
an
appeal,
if
that's
the
situation.
on
the
other
hand,
we
had
a
case
i
think
this
term
may
be
the
last,
in
which
a
person
alleged
that
his
attorney
had
deliberately
failed
to
go
ahead
with
his
appeal
and
the
attorney
had
filed
in
court
a
written
consent
signed
by
the
prisoner
to
dismiss
the
appeal.
i
think
experienced
attorneys
faced
with
charges
are
probably
being
careful.
if
they
decide
not
to
go
ahead
with
appeal
to
get
some
sort
of
acknowledgement
from
counsel
because
counsel
appointed
and
abused,
and
appointed
as
well
as
retained
are
subject
to
great
many
charges
by
precedent,
very
few
of
which
proved
to
be
justified.
however,
there
may
be
other
situations
attorney
may
say
i
didn't
feel
the
case
at
any
merit.
i
was
convinced
that
this
client
had
a
great
deal
of
money
and
i
therefore
so
no
need
to
inform
him
of
his
rights
in
forma
pauperis.
in
that
kind
of
situation,
at
least
to
get
you
to
narrow,
court
has
a
legal
question
to
decide.
do
you
–
does
a
retained
counsel
have
to
inform
a
man
who
believes
to
be
non-indigent
of
his
rights.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
oh!
i
think
that
it
becomes
--
once
you
get
a
responsive
plead,
a
man
says,
as
this
prisoner
says
here,
while
we
are
waiting,
counsel
said
he
brings
with
the
appeal
and
he
didn't
do
it
and
i
left
convinced
that
my
appeal
was
going
forward.
now,
i
think
we
get
a
reply
from
a
lawyer
first
before
we
get
a
lawyer.
we
--
we
get
a
responsive
pleading
whether
it's
in
the
form
of
a
request
by
the
united
states
--
to
the
united
states
attorney
to
get
it
or
directly.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
if
from
the
lawyer's
response.
it
becomes
clear
that
he
was
deprived
of
his
right
of
appeal.
of
course,
you
give
him
a
lawyer.
you
give
him
a
transcript
and
you
go
ahead
with
the
appeal.
if
it
becomes
clear
when
the
response
that
you
have
a
kind
of
an
issue
of
fact
that
can
be
res
--
determine
on
affidavit
then
you
give
him
a
lawyer
and
have
a
hearing
under
2255.
and
if
it
is
decided
that
he
does
have
a
right
of
appeal,
you
give
him
a
lawyer
on
appeal.
there's
no
question
that
if
the
appeal
is
allowed,
he
is
given
a
lawyer.
the
question
is,
can't
we
get
a
responsive
pleading
which
at
least
there
is
a
function
of
narrowing
the
issues
and
which
may
even
avoid
the
necessity
of
a
hearing?
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
before
we
have
to
give
a
lawyer.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
only
you
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
your
honor,
he
didn't
have
a
lawyer
except
the
prisoner
lawyer
is
a
pretty
good
one
in
this
case.
this
--
the
allocations
that
we
considers
sufficient
are
the
allegations
in
the
petitioner
in
the
writ
of
certiorari
before
counsel
here
was
appointed.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
yes.
that's
the
one.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
no!
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
all
we're
saying
is
he
leaves
allegations
that
he
makes
here
are
the
kind
that
a
prisoner
can
make
particularly
in
the
light
of
this
court's
decision
in
johnson
against
avery
and
the
system
that's
been
developed
in
the
federal
prisons
in
most
of
them
of
having
assistance
to
the
petitioners.
he
can
say
what
he
said
here.
this
isn't
asking
for
legal
points.
this
is
simply
asking
him
to
say
what
happened
between
him
and
his
lawyer.
now,
all
we
said
was,
if
this
same
kind
of
an
allegation
just
copy,
were
put
to
the
district
court,
the
district
court
would
have
to
do
something.
we
admit
that.
the
question
is
what
is
the
district
court
do
with
that
point?
and
we
say
the
first
thing
the
district
court
does
before
it
appoints
a
lawyer
or
before
it
desires
to
hold
a
hearing
is
to
ask
for
a
responsive
pleading
from
the
person
knows
which
is
the
lawyer
in
this
case
and
would
be
in
the
form
of
an
affidavit.
and
it
seems
to
us
that
this
serve
at
least
the
function
of
narrowing
the
issues
because
if
the
lawyer
does
say,
yes,
he
wanted
to
appeal,
and
i
said,
no,
i
wouldn't
do
if
except
unless
he
paid
me
“x”
dollars.
and
–
but
i
felt
no
need
to
do
anything
further
even
to
informing
him
of
rights
in
forma
pauperis.
then
the
district
court
doesn't
have
to
hold
a
hearing.
it
just
had
to
go
ahead
and
appoint
a
lawyer
and
let
the
appeal
proceed.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
that
brings
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
--
each
one
has
a
question.
there
are
two
different
ways
to
doing
it
and
i
think
the
one
that
your
honors
suggest
is
it
that
a
way.
it's
the
way
suggested
by
the
district
of
columbia
until
then
and
by
the
eighth
circuit,
i
believe
it
is,
which
is
to
vacate
the
sentence
and
re-sentence
so
that
the
10
days
where
appeals
start
to
running.
and
of
course,
at
that
point
he
has
to
appoint
a
lawyer
for
him.
i
think
that's
a
better
way
and
he
said,
it
had
problems
before
because
it
would
have
been
problems
of
credit
on
a
sentence.
but
in
view
of
the
new
statute
which
gives
the
prisoner
a
credit
on
a
sentence
for
all
the
terms
spend
in
the
jail
for
that
offense.
these
problems
would
not
arise
and
it
seems
to
me
more
expeditious
and
correct
to
have
the
sentence
vacated
and
the
appeal
proceeds
in
that
situation
and
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
--
i
think
that
it
would,
if
i
may
respectfully
so
suggest
be
desirable
that
an
opinion
so
indicate,
so
that
the
courts
who
are
faced
with
the
problems
will
know
what
to
do.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
pardon?
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
the
other
alternative
had
been
to
--
on
for
the
district
court
on
2255.
to
consider
the
issues
and
say,
there
is
no
issue
here
that's
worth
an
appeal
or
there
is
an
issue
here
that's
worth
an
appeal.
and
i
think
the
appellate
court
would
rule
this
way
and
so
all
ordering
new
trial
or
i
wouldn't.
i
think
that
is
undesirable
because
it
doesn't
remedy
the
wrong.
the
wrong
isn't
there
to
appeal
and
it
seems
to
me
therefore
that
if
were
going
back
to
where
the
wrong
occurred,
we
should
give
him
the
appeal
immediately
and
have
a
court
of
appeals
pass
on
it
rather
than
the
district
judge
for
his
rulings
in
the
sense
when
he's
trying
to
appeal.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
oh,
we
have
agreed
to
be
nice.
i
see
that
the
court
must
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
no,
i
think
the
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
your
honor,
i
was
not
--
i
said
i
thought
the
preferable
procedure
would
be
to
have
the
judge
vacate
the
judgment
and
allow
time
for
appeal.
i
think
that
is
preferable
procedure.
now
on
this
question
your
honor,
about
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
oh!
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that
i
can
on
my
own
say
that
counsel
was
derelict
in
his
duty
without
having
counsel
heard.
i
don't
know
what
happened
on
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
i
don't
know.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
i
don't
know
your
honor.
i
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
--
do
know
that
there
are
cases
in
which
there's
a
determination
counsel
had
said
to
a
prisoner,
“i
do
not
think
there
was
anything
to
be
gained
by
appeal.”
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
we
don't
know
what
has
been
said
your
honor.
we
know
what
the
prisoner
has
said
but
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
i
think
this
--
i
think
the
proper
is
to
--
for
this
court
to
rule
that
the
prisoner
need
not
show
grounds
for
appeal
that
if
the
allegation
in
its
petition,
it
can
be
present
back
to
consider
whether
the
allegations
of
the
petition
for
a
writ
of
certiorari
that
--
when
we
say
that
on
the
basis
of
the
allegations
and
the
petition
for
a
writ
of
certiorari.
the
district
court
must
determine
whether
the
petitioner
has
been
deprived
of
his
right
of
appeal.
now,
i
think
this
is
just
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
no,
it's
whether
he
stated
the
basis.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
it's
whether
he
has
stated
the
claim
which
the
district
court
should
consider
and
we
agree
that
he
has
stated
the
district
acclaim
which
the
district
court
should
consider.
but
i
do
think
that
counsel
is
entitled
to
be
heard.
now,
if
counsel
chooses
to
say
that
mea
culpa,
i
should
have
gone
ahead.
alright!
but
as
i
tell
you,
your
honor,
i
have
thin
cases
where
prisoners
have
said,
counsel
refused
to
take
an
appeal
for
me.
and
then
counsel
has
come
forward
with
the
document
which
the
prisoner
has
signed,
agreeing
to
dismiss
the
appeal.
i
don't
think
its
unfortunate
i
think
to
this
case
has
taken
so
long.
it's
unfortunate
that
this
--
his
first
attempts
did
weren't
considered
more
carefully.
but
if
we
are
establishing
the
general
rule,
i
have
seen
too
many
cases
where
counsel
was
abused
unnecessarily
to
accept
a
prisoner's
word
as
a
general
matter.
i
agree
that
if
what
mr.
ross
says
he
has
learned
informally
was
correct
may
be
easiest
way
in
this
case
would
be
that.
but
i'm
in
no
position
to
say
that
counsel
was
generally
without
knowing
the
facts.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
yes.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
that's
right.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
that's
our
position.
now,
the
reason
i
hesitated,
your
honor,
when
you
first
asked
me
if
we
suggested
in
our
brief
that
what
was
said
in
the
district
court
was
so
unspecific
compared
what
is
said
in
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
that
it
would
be
appropriate
to
just
let
him
start
all
over
again.
however,
i
don't
think
that's
terribly
important.
he
has
made
this
very
specific
allegations
in
light
of
the
fact
that
counsel
is
convinced
that
they
are
--
that
they
have
a
basis,
in
fact,
in
this
case.
then
i
think
that
it
could
well
be
a
remand
to
consider
this
but
i
do
think
that
we
cannot
in
the
sense
convict
counsel
without
giving
him
a
chance
to
say
what
his
version
of
events
is.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
your
honor.
the
judge
said
to
counsel,
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
--
they
have
to
file
a
written
to
the
judge.
even
on
this
hearing
said
to
counsel,
you
have
to
file
a
written
notice.
prisoner
himself
said
he
did
confer
with
counsel
after
sentencing.
something
went
on
there.
i
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
no,
after
sentencing.
this
was
at
sentencing.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
it
still
seems
to
me
that
a
defendant
has
said
that
counsel
promised
to
do
something
and
counsel
didn't
do
it.
now,
if
--
it's
very
simple
if
that's
the
fact
and
counsel
agrees
to
the
fact.
i
agree.
there's
nothing
further
to
do.
we
don't
need
a
hearing
if
the
man
gets
his
right
of
appeal.
but
it
is
still
true
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
we
have
agreed
to
that
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
i
think
your
honor,
you
are
if
so
ruling
accusing
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
i
think
that
we
are
accusing
counsel
of
the
derelicts
in
duty
without
hearing
counsel.
now,
i
agree
that
the
indications
in
this
particular
case
are
that
this
man
should
be
given
a
right
of
appeal
except
that
one
of
the
things
that
is
surprising
on
the
other
hand,
i
must
say,
is
that
there
were
other
defendants
represented
by
other
counsel,
separate
counsel.
now,
i'm
willing
to
believe
one
may
have
not
understood
his
obligations
completely.
i
find
it
hard
to
believe
that
i
think
its
four
different
counsels,
i'm
not
sure,
didn't
do
so.
however,
i
think
that
we
have
rules
here
that
must
be
a
part
across
the
board
and
we
cannot
fail
to
face
the
fact
that
there
are
many
prisoners
who
simply
creates
(inaudible)
very
convincing
and
turn
out
not
to
be,
to
be
absolutely
false
on
documentary
evidence.
so
that
in
having
general
rules
about
what
a
court
should
do,
i
think
that
we
have
to
consider
that
question
and
it's
not
--
it's
what
happens
generally.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
what?
of
the
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
of
the
right
to
counsel
on
appeal?
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
there
could
have
been
a
violation
of
the
right
to
counsel.
effective
assistance
to
counsel
in
the
sense
that,
does
counsel
duty
extend
to
carrying
through
to
the
point
of
at
least
notifying
him
of
a
right
of
appeal,
and
what
he
should
do
and
particularly
when
it
is
retained
counsel,
could
this
counsel
have
a
right
to
abandon
him?
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
of
course,
it
is
had
so
said
that
if
counsel
has
overreached
it's
in
some
form
or
another
that's
the
calland
case
in
the
seventh
circuit.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
if
you
were
in
that
instance
since
it's
very
hard
to
reconcile
the
cases
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
--
with
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
i
think
it
must
be
a
little
more
that
negligence.
it
must
be
a
failure
to
inform
of
the
rights.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
that's
right.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
that's
robinson.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
my
department
suggested
its
position
is
a
pure
negligence
without
any
of
the
reaching
aspects
is
not
enough.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
not
necessarily
because
he
says
the
counsel
agreed
and
then
deliberately
failed
to
take
any
steps.
now,
counsel
admits
that
it
doesn't
have
to
be
a
hearing.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
i
said
i
wouldn't
do
it
under
the
calland
case,
if
the
counsel
says,
the
only
way
you
can
take
an
appeal
is
to
pay
me
$500.00.
and
you
don't
tell
him
that
you
can
get
an
appeal
another
way
that
in
of
itself
is
enough.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
no.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
no.
on
--
well,
i
think
there's
a
possibility
of
distinction
if
you
have
a
kind
of
a
client
who
is
known
to
have
a
$100,000.00.
i
don't
think
you
have
to
tell
him
of
his
rights
to
appeal
as
an
indigent.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
but
what
you
say,
i
would
---
i
think
you
have
a
good
case
on
appeal
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
no.
cases
have
cleared
that
appointed
counsel
is
under
a
duty
to
either
takes
a
notice
of
appeal
and
ask
for
withdrawal
or
to
notify
the
defendant
of
what
must
be
done.
he
must
inform
him
of
the
time
for
appeal.
let
me
say
of
course
that
this
is
--
we
hope
a
dying
question
because
the
new
rules
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
no.
i
think
the
only
difference
is
the
situation
of
a
retaining
counsel
saying
to
a
defendant
whom
he
does
not
know
to
still
have
funds.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
i
think
you
have
a
good
pace
on
appeal
but
i
won't
do
unless
you
pay
me
$5,000.00.
now,
if
--
its
--
this
is
a
client
known
to
have
a
$100,000.00,
i
don't
think
the
client
--
a
retaining
counsel
is
under
a
duty
to
tell
him
about
the
rights
to
go
precedent
forma
pauperis.
on
the
other
hand,
if
you
have
in
this
situation
the
case
where
counsel
assumed
that
counsel
felt
he
wasn't
adequately
paid
for
the
trial
and
that
he
really
did
think
his
client
was
now
a
pauper
then
he
is
under
a
duty
to
tell
him
about
his
rights
as
an
indigent.
and
if
an
appointed
counsel
was
been
appointed
on
the
assumption
of
the
client
was
indigent,
he
is
under
a
duty
to
tell
him
that
his
rights
has
a
mean
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
may
it
please
the
court.
there
really
is
a
very
narrow,
almost
no
disagreement
with
between
the
petitioner
and
the
government
in
this
case.
the
case
is
not
quite
clear
and
quite
general
throughout
the
court
that
there
are
two
situations
which
do
call
for
some
relief
on
that
collateral
remedy
where
a
prisoner
claims
that
he
is
been
denied
of
right
of
appeal.
one
is
where
his
counsel
has
not
told
him
anything
about
his
rights
of
appeal
and
has
abandoned
him.
and
the
other
is,
if
counsel
has
been
guilty
of
what
courts
sometimes
called
fraud
but
which
if
you
look
at
the
case,
this
amount
to
over
reaching
and
it
doesn't
seem
to
be
any
conflict
on
proposition.
that
if
a
counsel
assures
a
defendant
that
he
will
take
care
of
his
appeal
and
then
deliberately
does
nothing,
not
just
it.
besides
that
this
is
a
basis
for
collateral
relief
with
ninth
circuit
and
possibly
to
other
circuits.
although,
their
decisions
are
not
wholly
clear
have
been
different
where
there
has
been
a
conflict
is
on
the
question
of
whether
in
addition
to
alleging
a
deprivation
of
right
to
appeal.
the
prisoner
has
to
show
that
it
was
some
basis
of
appeal
and
the
ninth
circuit
when
its
--
insisted
on
this
requirement.
we
understand
what
there
were
trying
to
do
which
is
try
to
shift
the
weak
the
good
case
and
the
bad
one
and
we
assume
that
if
a
man
had
a
good
point
on
appeal,
it
would
tend
to
both
to
his
contention
that
counsel
deliberately
didn't
do
it.
however
on
reflection,
we
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
we
can't
support
that
as
a
requirement
for
requiring
action
in
the
district
court
and
the
reason
for
that
is
that
--
it
seems
to
us
not
wholly
continent
with
the
real
remedy
that
you're
trying
to
get
at.
what
you
--
what
collateral
relief
was
primarily,
originally
designed
to
do
was
to
take
care
of
the
person
who
got
caught
in
the
coils
of
the
law
either
the
judge
or
the
prosecution
of
his
own
attorney.
and
it
seems
to
us
that
the
--
those
who
are
most
likely
to
abuse
the
writ.
that
really
kind
of
make
up
stories
if
we
do
encounter
could
meet
the
ninth
that
a
requirement
with
no
difficulty.
but
the
truly
honest,
ignorant
person
who
had
been
overreached
by
unscrupulous
lawyer
would
find
that
the
most
difficult
to
specify
whether
there
was
legal
error
in
his
trial
and
for
that
reason,
we
do
not
urge
the
ninth
circuit
rule.
but
since
the
case
is
here,
we
do
think
there
are
some
things
this
court
could
help
clarify
with
respect
to
this
kind
of
a
claim
or
perhaps
even
more
generally
with
respect
to
this
question
of,
what
does
a
judge
do
when
he
gets
an
allegation
of
this
kind?
i
think
no
one
who
has
had
experience
with
them
can
feel
to
appreciate
the
fact
that
a
lot
of
these
are
simply
not
true
and
the
result
wishful
thinking.
on
the
other
hand,
there
are
some
that
are.
we
have
agreed
that
if
what
this
petitioner
alleges
in
his
petition
for
a
writ
of
certiorari
which
is
must
more
detailed
and
much
more
specific
then
his
allegations
in
the
district
court.
we
have
agreed
that
if
--
what
he
alleges
in
a
petition
for
certiorari,
were
alleged
to
the
district
court.
the
district
court
would
have
to
do
something.
we
find
a
little
difficult
to
fool
the
district
court
on
that
acting
on
what
it
had
before
it
that.
but
even
aside
--
its
true
the
district
court
rested
on
the
ninth
circuit
rule
which
were
not
defending
but
even
on
the
petition
in
the
district
court.
it
seems
to
us
the
petition
is
not
specific
enough
as
petition
for
certiorari
is
to
require
action
and
we
think
that's
different.
we
think
he
have
a
right
to
require
specific
allegations
in
a
district
court
about
what
went
on
with
his
lawyer.
you
can't
expect
an
ignorant
prisoner
to
know
where
there
is
legal
error
to
track
but
he
can
know
what
went
on
with
his
lawyer.
now
in
this
--
in
the
petition,
just
--
he
alleges
something
which
is
fairly
consistent
with
what?
petitioner's
counsel
says,
he
has
discovered
ex
parte.
he
says,
that
he
asked
the
attorney
to
take
an
oral
notice
of
appeal.
no,
he
has
his
attorney
to
appeal
and
a
petitioner's
trial
counsel
gave
oral
notice
of
appeal.
i
assumed
he
considered
this
rather
cryptic
motion
to
be
an
oral
notice
of
appeal.
and
then
he
says,
petitioner's
wife
where
then
placed
in
a
room
to
await
transportation
back
to
the
county
jail
and
that
one
of
his
other
papers
in
the
record,
he
said,
he
was
held
in
the
county
jail
for
30
days.
but
at
this
point,
he
says,
while
they
were
waiting,
petitioner's
trial
counsel
came
to
take
petitioner's
wife
and
told
them
he
would
arrange
for
their
cases
to
be
appealed.
now
that
is
a
part
that's
--
we
don't
know
what
happened
there,
that's
after
this
hearing.
whatever
went
on
there
and
whether
it
is
true
or
not.
i
have
no
way
of
knowing
but
we
agreed
that
if
that
allegation,
that
counsel
said
he
would
arranged
all
the
cases
to
be
appealed
which
appears
only
in
petition
for
certiorari
it
made
to
the
district
court
would
call
for
some
action.
but
the
question
is
what
action?
and
i
think
that
this
is
important
not
only
in
these
situations
which
we
hope
full
of
rise
rarely
in
view
of
the
new
rules.
but
even
more
basically,
generally
in
2255
when
you
get
allegations
often
made
out
of
whole
cloth.
what
is
the
judge
do?
and
it
seems
to
me
that
these
--
this
court's
decisions
in
both
walker
against
johnston
in
312
united
states
and
in
machibroda
have
been
misunderstood.
in
both
of
those
cases,
there
were
responsive
affidavits
filed
and
the
court
held
on
the
basis
of
those
responsive
affidavits
where
one
side
said
“x”
and
the
other
side
said
exactly
the
opposite.
that
the
court
could
not
decide
the
matter
on
affidavits
that
there
had
to
be
a
hearing.
and
i
think
there
has
been
a
tendency
as
to
result
to
that
to
consider
that
affidavits
had
no
part
at
all
in
a
2255
application.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
machibroda,
your
honor.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
and
before
that
walker
against
johnston.
although
in
both
those
cases,
there
were
affidavits.
now
what
the
court
said
is
i
revoke
those
cases
is,
these
affidavits
present
a
clear
cut
conflict
of
testimony
and
we
have
something
as
clear
cut
as
that
it
has
to
be
resolve
to
the
hearing.
i
presumed
that
if
a
lawyer
in
this
case
said,
i
did
not
arrange
--
i
did
not
tell
the
defendants,
i
would
arrange
for
their
appeal.
and
defendants
said,
he
did
--
there
might
be
of
necessity
hearing
except
for
what
i
am
going
to
say
next
because
i
don't
think
that's
enough.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
first
thing
you
do
in
2255
generally
and
certainly
in
this
situation
is
to
try
to
get
the
--
a
responsive
pleading
in
one
from
one
to
another.
now,
this
court
just
last
monday
in
the
harris
case
talked
about
flexibility
of
procedures.
i
don't
think
it
has
to
be
a
formal
responsive
pleading
like
the
old
return
in
habeas
corpus
because
that
wouldn't
be
meaningful
but
what
you
do
want
is
to
get
something
in
the
form
--
in
the
record
which
seems
to
me
would
most
easily
take
the
form
of
an
affidavit.
getting
from
in
this
case,
the
attorney
since
the
government
has
no
part
of
all
these.
this
was
retained
counsel
and
knew
--
the
government
obviously
knew
nothing
that
went
on
here.
get
from
the
attorney
a
response.
now,
i
can
conceive
of
several
responses
which
might
settle
the
whole
question
one
way
or
another.
for
example,
if
the
attorney
says,
he
did
tell
me
he
would
like
to
appeal.
and
i
said
i
didn't
feel
that
i
could
do
it
for
less
than
“x”
dollars
and
that
i
did
not
feel
that
was
part
of
my
obligation
to
tell
him
anything
about
his
rights
in
forma
pauperis.
why?
because
we
don't
have
to
have
a
hearing,
we
just
go
ahead
with
an
appeal,
if
that's
the
situation.
on
the
other
hand,
we
had
a
case
i
think
this
term
may
be
the
last,
in
which
a
person
alleged
that
his
attorney
had
deliberately
failed
to
go
ahead
with
his
appeal
and
the
attorney
had
filed
in
court
a
written
consent
signed
by
the
prisoner
to
dismiss
the
appeal.
i
think
experienced
attorneys
faced
with
charges
are
probably
being
careful.
if
they
decide
not
to
go
ahead
with
appeal
to
get
some
sort
of
acknowledgement
from
counsel
because
counsel
appointed
and
abused,
and
appointed
as
well
as
retained
are
subject
to
great
many
charges
by
precedent,
very
few
of
which
proved
to
be
justified.
however,
there
may
be
other
situations
attorney
may
say
i
didn't
feel
the
case
at
any
merit.
i
was
convinced
that
this
client
had
a
great
deal
of
money
and
i
therefore
so
no
need
to
inform
him
of
his
rights
in
forma
pauperis.
in
that
kind
of
situation,
at
least
to
get
you
to
narrow,
court
has
a
legal
question
to
decide.
do
you
–
does
a
retained
counsel
have
to
inform
a
man
who
believes
to
be
non-indigent
of
his
rights.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
oh!
i
think
that
it
becomes
--
once
you
get
a
responsive
plead,
a
man
says,
as
this
prisoner
says
here,
while
we
are
waiting,
counsel
said
he
brings
with
the
appeal
and
he
didn't
do
it
and
i
left
convinced
that
my
appeal
was
going
forward.
now,
i
think
we
get
a
reply
from
a
lawyer
first
before
we
get
a
lawyer.
we
--
we
get
a
responsive
pleading
whether
it's
in
the
form
of
a
request
by
the
united
states
--
to
the
united
states
attorney
to
get
it
or
directly.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
if
from
the
lawyer's
response.
it
becomes
clear
that
he
was
deprived
of
his
right
of
appeal.
of
course,
you
give
him
a
lawyer.
you
give
him
a
transcript
and
you
go
ahead
with
the
appeal.
if
it
becomes
clear
when
the
response
that
you
have
a
kind
of
an
issue
of
fact
that
can
be
res
--
determine
on
affidavit
then
you
give
him
a
lawyer
and
have
a
hearing
under
2255.
and
if
it
is
decided
that
he
does
have
a
right
of
appeal,
you
give
him
a
lawyer
on
appeal.
there's
no
question
that
if
the
appeal
is
allowed,
he
is
given
a
lawyer.
the
question
is,
can't
we
get
a
responsive
pleading
which
at
least
there
is
a
function
of
narrowing
the
issues
and
which
may
even
avoid
the
necessity
of
a
hearing?
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
before
we
have
to
give
a
lawyer.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
only
you
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
your
honor,
he
didn't
have
a
lawyer
except
the
prisoner
lawyer
is
a
pretty
good
one
in
this
case.
this
--
the
allocations
that
we
considers
sufficient
are
the
allegations
in
the
petitioner
in
the
writ
of
certiorari
before
counsel
here
was
appointed.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
yes.
that's
the
one.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
no!
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
all
we're
saying
is
he
leaves
allegations
that
he
makes
here
are
the
kind
that
a
prisoner
can
make
particularly
in
the
light
of
this
court's
decision
in
johnson
against
avery
and
the
system
that's
been
developed
in
the
federal
prisons
in
most
of
them
of
having
assistance
to
the
petitioners.
he
can
say
what
he
said
here.
this
isn't
asking
for
legal
points.
this
is
simply
asking
him
to
say
what
happened
between
him
and
his
lawyer.
now,
all
we
said
was,
if
this
same
kind
of
an
allegation
just
copy,
were
put
to
the
district
court,
the
district
court
would
have
to
do
something.
we
admit
that.
the
question
is
what
is
the
district
court
do
with
that
point?
and
we
say
the
first
thing
the
district
court
does
before
it
appoints
a
lawyer
or
before
it
desires
to
hold
a
hearing
is
to
ask
for
a
responsive
pleading
from
the
person
knows
which
is
the
lawyer
in
this
case
and
would
be
in
the
form
of
an
affidavit.
and
it
seems
to
us
that
this
serve
at
least
the
function
of
narrowing
the
issues
because
if
the
lawyer
does
say,
yes,
he
wanted
to
appeal,
and
i
said,
no,
i
wouldn't
do
if
except
unless
he
paid
me
“x”
dollars.
and
–
but
i
felt
no
need
to
do
anything
further
even
to
informing
him
of
rights
in
forma
pauperis.
then
the
district
court
doesn't
have
to
hold
a
hearing.
it
just
had
to
go
ahead
and
appoint
a
lawyer
and
let
the
appeal
proceed.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
that
brings
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
--
each
one
has
a
question.
there
are
two
different
ways
to
doing
it
and
i
think
the
one
that
your
honors
suggest
is
it
that
a
way.
it's
the
way
suggested
by
the
district
of
columbia
until
then
and
by
the
eighth
circuit,
i
believe
it
is,
which
is
to
vacate
the
sentence
and
re-sentence
so
that
the
10
days
where
appeals
start
to
running.
and
of
course,
at
that
point
he
has
to
appoint
a
lawyer
for
him.
i
think
that's
a
better
way
and
he
said,
it
had
problems
before
because
it
would
have
been
problems
of
credit
on
a
sentence.
but
in
view
of
the
new
statute
which
gives
the
prisoner
a
credit
on
a
sentence
for
all
the
terms
spend
in
the
jail
for
that
offense.
these
problems
would
not
arise
and
it
seems
to
me
more
expeditious
and
correct
to
have
the
sentence
vacated
and
the
appeal
proceeds
in
that
situation
and
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
--
i
think
that
it
would,
if
i
may
respectfully
so
suggest
be
desirable
that
an
opinion
so
indicate,
so
that
the
courts
who
are
faced
with
the
problems
will
know
what
to
do.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
pardon?
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
the
other
alternative
had
been
to
--
on
for
the
district
court
on
2255.
to
consider
the
issues
and
say,
there
is
no
issue
here
that's
worth
an
appeal
or
there
is
an
issue
here
that's
worth
an
appeal.
and
i
think
the
appellate
court
would
rule
this
way
and
so
all
ordering
new
trial
or
i
wouldn't.
i
think
that
is
undesirable
because
it
doesn't
remedy
the
wrong.
the
wrong
isn't
there
to
appeal
and
it
seems
to
me
therefore
that
if
were
going
back
to
where
the
wrong
occurred,
we
should
give
him
the
appeal
immediately
and
have
a
court
of
appeals
pass
on
it
rather
than
the
district
judge
for
his
rulings
in
the
sense
when
he's
trying
to
appeal.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
oh,
we
have
agreed
to
be
nice.
i
see
that
the
court
must
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
no,
i
think
the
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
your
honor,
i
was
not
--
i
said
i
thought
the
preferable
procedure
would
be
to
have
the
judge
vacate
the
judgment
and
allow
time
for
appeal.
i
think
that
is
preferable
procedure.
now
on
this
question
your
honor,
about
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
oh!
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that
i
can
on
my
own
say
that
counsel
was
derelict
in
his
duty
without
having
counsel
heard.
i
don't
know
what
happened
on
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
i
don't
know.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
i
don't
know
your
honor.
i
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
--
do
know
that
there
are
cases
in
which
there's
a
determination
counsel
had
said
to
a
prisoner,
“i
do
not
think
there
was
anything
to
be
gained
by
appeal.”
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
we
don't
know
what
has
been
said
your
honor.
we
know
what
the
prisoner
has
said
but
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
i
think
this
--
i
think
the
proper
is
to
--
for
this
court
to
rule
that
the
prisoner
need
not
show
grounds
for
appeal
that
if
the
allegation
in
its
petition,
it
can
be
present
back
to
consider
whether
the
allegations
of
the
petition
for
a
writ
of
certiorari
that
--
when
we
say
that
on
the
basis
of
the
allegations
and
the
petition
for
a
writ
of
certiorari.
the
district
court
must
determine
whether
the
petitioner
has
been
deprived
of
his
right
of
appeal.
now,
i
think
this
is
just
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
no,
it's
whether
he
stated
the
basis.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
it's
whether
he
has
stated
the
claim
which
the
district
court
should
consider
and
we
agree
that
he
has
stated
the
district
acclaim
which
the
district
court
should
consider.
but
i
do
think
that
counsel
is
entitled
to
be
heard.
now,
if
counsel
chooses
to
say
that
mea
culpa,
i
should
have
gone
ahead.
alright!
but
as
i
tell
you,
your
honor,
i
have
thin
cases
where
prisoners
have
said,
counsel
refused
to
take
an
appeal
for
me.
and
then
counsel
has
come
forward
with
the
document
which
the
prisoner
has
signed,
agreeing
to
dismiss
the
appeal.
i
don't
think
its
unfortunate
i
think
to
this
case
has
taken
so
long.
it's
unfortunate
that
this
--
his
first
attempts
did
weren't
considered
more
carefully.
but
if
we
are
establishing
the
general
rule,
i
have
seen
too
many
cases
where
counsel
was
abused
unnecessarily
to
accept
a
prisoner's
word
as
a
general
matter.
i
agree
that
if
what
mr.
ross
says
he
has
learned
informally
was
correct
may
be
easiest
way
in
this
case
would
be
that.
but
i'm
in
no
position
to
say
that
counsel
was
generally
without
knowing
the
facts.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
yes.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
that's
right.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
that's
our
position.
now,
the
reason
i
hesitated,
your
honor,
when
you
first
asked
me
if
we
suggested
in
our
brief
that
what
was
said
in
the
district
court
was
so
unspecific
compared
what
is
said
in
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
that
it
would
be
appropriate
to
just
let
him
start
all
over
again.
however,
i
don't
think
that's
terribly
important.
he
has
made
this
very
specific
allegations
in
light
of
the
fact
that
counsel
is
convinced
that
they
are
--
that
they
have
a
basis,
in
fact,
in
this
case.
then
i
think
that
it
could
well
be
a
remand
to
consider
this
but
i
do
think
that
we
cannot
in
the
sense
convict
counsel
without
giving
him
a
chance
to
say
what
his
version
of
events
is.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
your
honor.
the
judge
said
to
counsel,
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
--
they
have
to
file
a
written
to
the
judge.
even
on
this
hearing
said
to
counsel,
you
have
to
file
a
written
notice.
prisoner
himself
said
he
did
confer
with
counsel
after
sentencing.
something
went
on
there.
i
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
no,
after
sentencing.
this
was
at
sentencing.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
it
still
seems
to
me
that
a
defendant
has
said
that
counsel
promised
to
do
something
and
counsel
didn't
do
it.
now,
if
--
it's
very
simple
if
that's
the
fact
and
counsel
agrees
to
the
fact.
i
agree.
there's
nothing
further
to
do.
we
don't
need
a
hearing
if
the
man
gets
his
right
of
appeal.
but
it
is
still
true
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
we
have
agreed
to
that
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
i
think
your
honor,
you
are
if
so
ruling
accusing
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
i
think
that
we
are
accusing
counsel
of
the
derelicts
in
duty
without
hearing
counsel.
now,
i
agree
that
the
indications
in
this
particular
case
are
that
this
man
should
be
given
a
right
of
appeal
except
that
one
of
the
things
that
is
surprising
on
the
other
hand,
i
must
say,
is
that
there
were
other
defendants
represented
by
other
counsel,
separate
counsel.
now,
i'm
willing
to
believe
one
may
have
not
understood
his
obligations
completely.
i
find
it
hard
to
believe
that
i
think
its
four
different
counsels,
i'm
not
sure,
didn't
do
so.
however,
i
think
that
we
have
rules
here
that
must
be
a
part
across
the
board
and
we
cannot
fail
to
face
the
fact
that
there
are
many
prisoners
who
simply
creates
(inaudible)
very
convincing
and
turn
out
not
to
be,
to
be
absolutely
false
on
documentary
evidence.
so
that
in
having
general
rules
about
what
a
court
should
do,
i
think
that
we
have
to
consider
that
question
and
it's
not
--
it's
what
happens
generally.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
what?
of
the
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
of
the
right
to
counsel
on
appeal?
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
there
could
have
been
a
violation
of
the
right
to
counsel.
effective
assistance
to
counsel
in
the
sense
that,
does
counsel
duty
extend
to
carrying
through
to
the
point
of
at
least
notifying
him
of
a
right
of
appeal,
and
what
he
should
do
and
particularly
when
it
is
retained
counsel,
could
this
counsel
have
a
right
to
abandon
him?
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
of
course,
it
is
had
so
said
that
if
counsel
has
overreached
it's
in
some
form
or
another
that's
the
calland
case
in
the
seventh
circuit.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
if
you
were
in
that
instance
since
it's
very
hard
to
reconcile
the
cases
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
--
with
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
i
think
it
must
be
a
little
more
that
negligence.
it
must
be
a
failure
to
inform
of
the
rights.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
that's
right.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
that's
robinson.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
my
department
suggested
its
position
is
a
pure
negligence
without
any
of
the
reaching
aspects
is
not
enough.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
not
necessarily
because
he
says
the
counsel
agreed
and
then
deliberately
failed
to
take
any
steps.
now,
counsel
admits
that
it
doesn't
have
to
be
a
hearing.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
i
said
i
wouldn't
do
it
under
the
calland
case,
if
the
counsel
says,
the
only
way
you
can
take
an
appeal
is
to
pay
me
$500.00.
and
you
don't
tell
him
that
you
can
get
an
appeal
another
way
that
in
of
itself
is
enough.

on
--
well,
i
think
there's
a
possibility
of
distinction
if
you
have
a
kind
of
a
client
who
is
known
to
have
a
$100,000.00.
i
don't
think
you
have
to
tell
him
of
his
rights
to
appeal
as
an
indigent.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
but
what
you
say,
i
would
---
i
think
you
have
a
good
case
on
appeal
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
no.
cases
have
cleared
that
appointed
counsel
is
under
a
duty
to
either
takes
a
notice
of
appeal
and
ask
for
withdrawal
or
to
notify
the
defendant
of
what
must
be
done.
he
must
inform
him
of
the
time
for
appeal.
let
me
say
of
course
that
this
is
--
we
hope
a
dying
question
because
the
new
rules

ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
no.
i
think
the
only
difference
is
the
situation
of
a
retaining
counsel
saying
to
a
defendant
whom
he
does
not
know
to
still
have
funds.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
i
think
you
have
a
good
pace
on
appeal
but
i
won't
do
unless
you
pay
me
$5,000.00.
now,
if
--
its
--
this
is
a
client
known
to
have
a
$100,000.00,
i
don't
think
the
client
--
a
retaining
counsel
is
under
a
duty
to
tell
him
about
the
rights
to
go
precedent
forma
pauperis.
on
the
other
hand,
if
you
have
in
this
situation
the
case
where
counsel
assumed
that
counsel
felt
he
wasn't
adequately
paid
for
the
trial
and
that
he
really
did
think
his
client
was
now
a
pauper
then
he
is
under
a
duty
to
tell
him
about
his
rights
as
an
indigent.
and
if
an
appointed
counsel
was
been
appointed
on
the
assumption
of
the
client
was
indigent,
he
is
under
a
duty
to
tell
him
that
his
rights
