what's
the
predicate
on
your
position
here,
is
it
rule
of
criminal
procedure
or
are
they
with
supervisory
powers
constitute
--
justice
byron
r.
white
of
the
counsel
you're
talking
about?
justice
byron
r.
white
quite
right.
what
reason
do
we
get
for
--
what
violation
may
have
--
may
there
have
been
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
any
counsel
would
be
it
fails
to
follow
its
orders.
fails
to
follow
his
agreement
that
is
the
deprivation
of
right
to
counsel?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
what
we
reached
but
you
would
--
you
would
throw
in
with
that
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
ms.
rosenberg,
i
am
just
asking
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
what
do
you
think
the
answer
is?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
claim
makes
this
instance
forgetting
about
it
or
he
puts
(inaudible).
justice
byron
r.
white
--
the
secretary
is
sick
that's
the
fifth?
justice
byron
r.
white
alright.
that
may
be
robinson
that
puts
you
to
the
department
of
justice,
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then
i
suppose
you
would
say
there
would
have
to
be
a
hearing
in
this
case
you
get
it.
well,
base
on
your
position?
justice
byron
r.
white
deliberately?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
have
repeated
the
cases
here,
you
well
know
that
maybe
he
knows
about
either
--
maybe
you
wouldn't
distinguish
unless
with
respect
between
your
point
of
view?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
well
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
still
--
but
there's
a
point
of
counsel.
lets
assume
counsel's
case
had
been
appointed
the
same
thing
happened,
you
would
have
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
make
a
difference
in
the
point
in
your
indictment?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
tell
him,
your
client
said,
“please
appeal”
and
neither
the
appointed
counsel
or
the
retained
counsel
does
so.
are
they
both
under
this?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
you're
relying
with
department
of
justice
suggested
before
and
all
these
cases
were
failure
of
counsel
to
take
some
set
which
is
either
review
or
the
part
that
except
--
expected
from
you
that
you
want
to
go
in
between
the
negligence
of
the
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
your
negligence
do
you
say
that
the
whether
the
counsel
retained
or
not
or
appointed,
the
client
is
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
there's
a
constitutional
--
is
there
constitutional
right
to
a
lawyer
in
2255?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
at
least
i
suppose
if
this
court
rule
that
there
should
be
a
hearing
the
practice
in
the
ninth
circuit
would
be
to
appoint
a

do
appoint
