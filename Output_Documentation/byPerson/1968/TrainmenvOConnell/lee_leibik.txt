mr.
lee
leibik
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
as
in
the
previous
companion
case,
we
have
no
clients
who
have
any
continuing
interest
in
this
litigation.
mr.
lee
leibik
we
have
no
clients
who
have
any
continuing
interest
in
this
litigation.
mr.
lee
leibik
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
lee
leibik
yes,
sir.
mr.
lee
leibik
yes.
insofar
as
we've
been
able
to
ascertain,
there
are
no
pending
damage
claims
on
behalf
of
the
any
member.
at
the
time
and
prior
to
the
effectiveness
of
this
agreement
on
the
milwaukee
--
the
milwaukee
railroad
issued
a
bulletin
informing
all
its
employees
that
there
would
be
no
enforcement
of
this
agreement
pending
the
outcome
of
this
litigation.
no
employee
on
the
milwaukee
railroad
has
been
discharged,
no
employee,
to
the
best
of
our
knowledge,
has
ever
been
cited
for
non-compliance
with
the
union
shop
provision.
mr.
lee
leibik
as
i
understand,
some
people
did.
i'm
not
certain
--
mr.
lee
leibik
no,
there
were
no
damages
alleged
on
behalf
of
any
individual
in
our
complaint
in
the
district
court.
our
prayer
for
leave
sought
only
damages
on
behalf
of
the
switchmen's
union
of
north
america
which
has
now
been
merged
in
the
united
transportation
union.
mr.
lee
leibik
i
believe
that
some
individuals
did
join
the
brotherhood
of
railroad
trainmen.
the
--
mr.
lee
leibik
we
may
--
mr.
lee
leibik
we
made
some
reference
in
our
brief
in
the
court
of
appeals,
the
fact
that
if
we
could
possibly
prove
up
in
the
district
court
that
anybody
was
damaged
by
being
compelled
to
join
the
brotherhood
--
mr.
lee
leibik
this
is
purely
speculated.
mr.
lee
leibik
i
have
no
knowledge
of
any
pending
claim
for
damages
growing
out
of
compelling
membership
in
the
brotherhood
of
railroad
trainmen
during
the
course
of
this
litigation.
mr.
lee
leibik
well,
the
fact
is
that
our
complaint
--
mr.
lee
leibik
no,
i
would
not.
mr.
lee
leibik
i
do
not
believe
--
to
the
best
of
my
information,
i
believe
there
are
no
damage
claims
which
were
incurred
by
any
employee
on
the
chicago-milwaukee
railroad.
mr.
lee
leibik
yes.
mr.
lee
leibik
as
so
far
as
i
can
ascertain,
nobody
has
been
damaged
--
mr.
lee
leibik
there
are
--
there
is
a
machinery
within
the
united
transportation
union
for
filing
case
--
mr.
lee
leibik
that
is
speculated.
mr.
lee
leibik
because
i
--
i'm
not
certain
as
to
whether
or
not
they
were
ever
compelled
to
join
the
brotherhood
of
railroad
trainmen
and
abandon
their
membership
in
the
switchmen's
union
of
north
america.
particularly
in
as
much
as
the
chicago
milwaukee
railroad
did
issue
a
bulletin
to
all
the
employee
that
there
would
be
no
enforcement
of
this
particular
agreement
pending
the
outcome
of
the
litigation.
mr.
lee
leibik
some
200.
mr.
lee
leibik
i
believe
it
would
be
purely
speculative
on
my
part
to
suggest
that
some
individual
may
or
may
not
file
a
claim
for
damages
based
upon
being
compelled
to
join
the
brotherhood
of
railroad
trainmen.
but
--
mr.
lee
leibik
that's
correct.
mr.
lee
leibik
well,
i
have
made
every
effort
to
ascertain
from
the
six
named
individual
plaintiffs
as
to
whether
or
not
they
have
any
continuing
interest
in
this
litigation,
as
to
whether
or
not
they
have
any
--
six
--
mr.
lee
leibik
there
has
been
no
effort
made
to
ascertain
the
desires
of
the
entire
class.
some
was
suggested
of
course
that
if
this
where
handled
on
the
basis
of
the
writ
of
certiorari
having
been
improperly
granted,
it
would
be
remanded
to
the
district
court
for
further
proceedings.
and,
i
believe
that
could
clearly
take
care
of
any
conceivable
claims
which
may
be
advanced
by
any
individuals.
mr.
lee
leibik
well,
we're
in
the
unfortunate
position
of
having
been
requested
by
the
united
transportation
union,
and
we
are
representing
same
union
now
since
the
unions
have
merged,
of
not
arguing
our
position
in
this
case,
that
we
advanced
in
the
district
court
and
in
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
and
seventh
circuit
where
we
were
successful.
mr.
lee
leibik
that's
--
mr.
lee
leibik
yes.
mr.
lee
leibik
the
brotherhood
of
locomotive
engineers,
which
is
n
ot
a
party
for
this
litigation
and
at
no
time
has
been
a
party
--
mr.
lee
leibik
for
this
litigation.
mr.
lee
leibik
yes.
mr.
lee
leibik
no.
the
brotherhood
of
locomotive
engineers
filed
an
amicus
brief
in
support
of
the
position
of
the
--
mr.
uelmen
here.
the
brotherhood
of
locomotive
firemen
&
enginemen,
however,
filed
an
amicus
brief
in
support
of
our
position
prior
to
the
merger
of
the
unions
that
you're
concerned.
neither
the
brotherhood
of
locomotive
engineers
nor
the
brotherhood
of
locomotive
firemen
&
enginemen
are
parties
to
the
litigation
in
the
erie
case
or
parties
to
the
litigation
on
the
milwaukee
case,
and
they
are
not
parties
to
the
contract
herein
concern.
mr.
lee
leibik
no,
you
have
not,
and
i
pursued
that
point
--
mr.
lee
leibik
we
would
be

mr.
lee
leibik
we
would
be
very
delighted
to
provide
the
court
with
the
supplemental
brief.
mr.
lee
leibik
yes,
justice
black.
mr.
lee
leibik
that
is
correct.
mr.
lee
leibik
one.
mr.
lee
leibik
under
the
united
transportation
union.
that
embraces
the
brotherhood
of
--
the
former
brotherhood
of
railroad
trainmen,
the
order
of
railway
conductors
and
breakmen,
the
brotherhood
of
locomotive
firemen
&
enginemen,
and
the
switchmen
union
of
north
america.
mr.
lee
leibik
that's
is
quite
of
correct,
justice
black,
and
they
have
established
a
disputes
committee.
mr.
lee
leibik
yes,
there
is
one
treasury
for
all
four
unions.
now,
it's
a
completely
merged
operation
and
there
is
a
disputes
committee
set
up
within
the
united
transportation
union
to
provide
for
overlapping
inter-union
disputes.
mr.
lee
leibik
there
had
been
suits
already
instituted.
mr.
uelmen
referred
to
a
suit
brought
in
the
south
which
has
been
dismissed
as
of
this
date.
mr.
lee
leibik
but,
i
suppose
there
will
be
matters
litigated
with
respect
to
this
merger
for
some
period
of
time.
mr.
lee
leibik
that's
a
question
i
cannot
answer,
justice
marshall.
mr.
lee
leibik
i
must
say
that
to
the
court
in
all
candor.
mr.
lee
leibik
i
believe
the
brotherhood
would
be
protected
in
that
fashion.
i
--
mr.
lee
leibik
it's
like
advancing
--
mr.
lee
leibik
i
can't
conceive
of
anybody
having
been
injured
by
the
effect
of
what
occurred
as
a
result
of
the
agreement.
mr.
lee
leibik
certainly.
mr.
lee
leibik
i
think
that's
a
possibility
but
also,
on
the
other
hand,
i
think
the
answer
of
the
organization
would
be
that
they
have
spent
that
money
right
up
to
the
supreme
court
now
and
--
mr.
lee
leibik
they
were
neither
compelled
to
join
nor
to
drop
their
membership
on
the
basis
of
the
bulletin
issued
by
the
milwaukee
railroad
while
this
litigation
was
pending
in
the
courts,
and
we
know
of
no
employee
who
was
cited
for
non-compliance
with
the
union
shop
agreement.
mr.
lee
leibik
i
know
of
none
personally.
mr.
lee
leibik
and
i
had
spoken
only
to
the
named
plaintiffs.
mr.
lee
leibik
as
they
now
are,
yes.
mr.
lee
leibik
that's
quite
correct.
mr.
lee
leibik
well,
we
represent
these
individuals,
but
we
do
not
believe
and
we've
not
been
informed
by
any
members
of
the
class
that
there
is
any
continuing
interest
in
this
litigation
on

of
those
individuals.
mr.
