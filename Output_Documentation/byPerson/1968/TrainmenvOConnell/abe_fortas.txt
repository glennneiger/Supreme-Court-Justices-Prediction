justice
abe
fortas
except
that
the
engineers
are
not
parties
here,
aren't
they?
justice
abe
fortas
and
has
the
respondent
filed,
i
notice
you
filed
just
few
days
ago
telling
us
about
these
events,
has
the
respondent
there
replied
to
your
finding?
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
but
the
difficulty
is
that
this
is
here
on
certiorari,
isn’t
it?
justice
abe
fortas
and,
the
basic
issue,
it
maybe
a
money
claim
pending
but
the
question
in
my
mind
is
whether
it’s
a
matter
that
we
would
--
which
we
would
have
granted
certiorari
if
the
facts
had
been
established,
if
the
facts
that
seem
to
exist
now
existed
at
the
time
that
we
considered
the
petition
for
certiorari.
justice
abe
fortas
i
know
that,
but
i
say
that
if
they
did,
the
question
is
whether
we
would
have
issued
the
--
issued
the
writ
here.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
not
that,
so
much
as
that
the
underlying
issue
seems
to
be
one
in
which
--
which
might
not
be
appropriate.
i
don’t
know
whether
it
is
or
not
because
we
haven’t
heard
from
the
other
side.
the
other
side
filed
nothing
here,
and
i
know
this
is
your
supplemental
pleading
here,
but
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
don't
know.
i
don't
know
that
we
would
have
--
i
don't
know
that
certiorari
would
have
been
granted.
i
don't
know
that
it
wouldn't.
well,
i
just
don't
know
that
certiorari
would
have
been
granted
because,
here,
you
have
people
arguing
a
very
important
issue
on
the
basis
not
of
a
basic
conflict
of
interest,
but
on
the
basis
of
a
relatively
small
money
judgment
below.
justice
abe
fortas
i
know,
but
--
justice
abe
fortas
of
course
the
question
about
the
kind
of
--
i
know
which
we
are
to
spend
this
--
spend
our
own
time
on
these
cases.
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
wondering
if
it
wouldn't
be
appropriate
--
i'm
wondering
if
it
wouldn't
be
appropriate
or
in
a
file
something
which
happened
here
is
that
both
sides
have
come
in
and
presented
us
with
a
new
drama,
new
script
where
this
drama
was
to
be
enacted
before
this
court
on
this
day,
the
january
14,
1969.
your
adversary
did
file
a
supplemental
pleading
and
--
but
we
haven't
heard
from
you
until
this
moment,
have
we?
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
wondering
where
much
of
about
--
i'm
wondering
whether
we
ought
to
have
it
see
--
justice
abe
fortas
further
submissions
here
just
so
we
can
be
sure
of
who's
on
first
base,
if
anybody
is,
because,
at
the
moment,
it's
--
everybody
seems
to
be
in
between
the
bases.
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
not
--
but,
i'm
not
sure
that,
in
the
class
action,
the
district
court
would
have
to
give
notice
in
the
event
that
a
judgment
were
vacated
on
the
grounds
that
there's
no
case
controversy
as
it
presently
stands.
now,
that
would
be
quite
different
from
a
situation
where
the
district
court
dismisses
a
complaint
or
approves
a
settlement
or
something
like
that.
i'm
not
--
and
i
suggest
to
you
that
there
is
at
least
that
possibility.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
what
bothers
me
about
this
is
that
this
document
--
you
filed
this
document
as
of
january
13.
justice
abe
fortas
i
don't
know
when
your
merger
was
agreed
on.
it
became
effective
january
1.
justice
abe
fortas
january
13
was
yesterday,
and
now
you
and
your
adversaries
are
in
here
with
very
totally
changed,
basically
changed
set
of
circumstances
and
facts.
as
far
as
i'm
concerned,
i
will
await
whatever
writ
or
submission
you
make.
