is
there
anything
in
the
legislative
history
that
shows
that
congress
was
reaching
for
this
problem?
justice
john
m.
harlan
situation
where
the
union
--
the
other
union
no
longer
makes
a
thrust?
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
language
of
the
act
certainly
supports
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
don't
remember
rychlik
and
rohrer
which,
as
you're
aware,
brought
it
here.
justice
john
m.
harlan
we're
dealing
with
the
context
of
a
union
still
bargaining
for
him.
justice
john
m.
harlan
would
you
elaborate
that
a
little
bit?
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
then,
i
don't
understand.
your
opponent
says
the
opposite.
he
says
there
are
potential
claims
against
the
brotherhood.
justice
john
m.
harlan
are
you
in
the
position
to
represent
that
if
these
cases
are
dismissed
as
moot,
if
this
case
is
dismissed
as
moot,
that
the
brotherhood
is
from
in
no
risk
of
a
basic
future
damage
kind
and
reason
to
get
you
into
this
union?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
represent
not
only
individuals,
but
you
represent
the
party.
justice
john
m.
harlan
aren't
you
in
the
position
to
ascertain
and
shouldn't
you
ascertain
before
the
court
acts
on
the
claim
of
mootness?
i'm
talking
about
whether
it's
certain
that
it's
in
this
case,
then
shouldn't
you
bring
into
court
and
have
those
statutes
before
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
claims.
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
you're
really
saying
is
that,
from
your
standpoint
at
the
moment,
based
on
your
present
information
and
understanding,
you
think
this
case
is
moot?
justice
john
m.
harlan
therefore,
it
would
be
appropriate
for
the
court,
in
your
view,
not
only
remand
the
case,
but
to
vacate
the
judgment
below
so
that
the
only
future
claims
that
arise
would
have
to
start
all
over
again.
in
other
words,
the
brotherhood
would
be
protected
in
that
fashion,
is
that
your
point?
justice
john
m.
harlan
how
could
anyone
be
injured
by
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
maybe
whatever
the
legal
recitation
would
make
but
given
the
merger,
maybe
you'll
find
it's
better
to
refund
all
that
money
as
a
practical
business
matter
than
to
go
through
an
expensive
litigation
to
litigate
in
that
question
just
like
you
did
now.
justice
john
m.
harlan
it's
very
disappointing.
i
mean,
the
litigation
comes
up
here
and
find
themselves
out
of
the
case.
