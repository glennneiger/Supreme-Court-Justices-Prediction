justice
byron
r.
white
well
who
got
--
did
anybody
get
fired
for
not
joining?
did
anybody
have
to
join
the
union
that
he
didn't
want
to?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
do
you
still
have
the
same
--
i
suppose
is
a
--
that
the
fourth
union
is
the
fireman
and
engineman?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes
and
the
fireman
and
the
engineers
have
a
little
thing
going
between
them,
don't
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
no
but
this
union,
this
surviving
union
has
this
issue
still
a
live
issue
with
the
engineers.
justice
byron
r.
white
because
this
surviving
union
has
fireman
and
engineman
in
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
this
--
and
they
would
like
to
enforce
the
agreement
they
have
with
the
erie
lackawanna
with
respect
to
the
engineers.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
this
is
a
very
unusual.
justice
byron
r.
white
unless
there's
a
suit
for
damages
also?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
were
the
damages
based
in
claim
for
damages
based
on?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
many
are
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
the
judgment
of
the
court
below
stayed
or
did
these
people
cease
being
members
of
brotherhood?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
right.
and
so,
then
the
men
ceased
being
members
of
the
brotherhood
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
wouldn't
all
of
them
pay
taxes?
justice
byron
r.
white
unless,
the
seventh
circuit
opinion
would
stay.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
see.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
was
certainly
was
a
standard
saying
at
the
time
these
past
--
these
amendments
were
passed
to
--
for
one
of
the
railroad
unions
to
represent
several
crafts.
justice
byron
r.
white
and,
i
guess
that
background
when
congress
used
this
broad
language.
justice
byron
r.
white
your
position
is
they
didn't
need
any
language.
all
they
needed
to
do
is
to
live
up
to
the
union
shop
agreement.
justice
byron
r.
white
to
be
a
member
of
the
union
and
have
the
contract.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that,
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
suppose
congress
could've
put
it
like
your
brief.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
--
is
there
another
case
in
which
the
issue
--
are
there
some
other
cases
where
the
issue
is
whether
an
employee
may
get
a
minority
union
--
get
some
union
that
doesn't
have
collective
bargaining
representative
to
process
his
grievance
for
him
or
to
represent
him
at
a
grievance?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
case
--
these
cases
aren't
related?
justice
byron
r.
white
had
no
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
joined
the
other
union?
they
joine
the
union
as
they're
required
to.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
have
a
damage
claim
in
the
court
of
appeals
or
did
they
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so,
your
individuals
never
did
--
they
did
join
the
union
that
they
didn't
want
to
join.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
never
asserted
any
right
to
--
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
--
to
make
any
claim?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
sort
of
be
remanded
to
the
district
court
to
determine
damages
for
the
individuals
having
paid
dues
when
they
shouldn't
have
had
to?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
now
say
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
now
say
that
whether
you
had
damages
claims
or
whether
you
didn't,
you
don't
have
them
now.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
made
a
pending
claim,
but
you've
got
as
much
claim
the
damages
you
had
when
you
made
this
kind
of
a
claim
in
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
byron
r.
white
have
you
changed
your
position
now?
i
mean,
you
were
saying,
“now,
i
abandon
all
claims
for
damages.”
justice
byron
r.
white
on
behalf
of
your
client?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you're
saying
that
on
behalf
of
your
client?
justice
byron
r.
white
but,
if
they
made
a
damage
claim,
it
would
be
fruitless?
i
mean,
they
haven't
been
damaged.
justice
byron
r.
white
except,
they
could
--
justice
byron
r.
white
except
if
they
paid
dues
to
the
union
that
they
then
claim,
and
it
may
still
be
true,
that
they
didn't
have
to
join.
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
speculated?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
were
compelled
to
join.
they
weren't
compelled
to
drop
their
membership.
justice
byron
