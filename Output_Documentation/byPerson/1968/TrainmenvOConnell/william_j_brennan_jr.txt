justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
is
that
the
case
here
then?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
can
there
be,
this
has
to
do
with
membership
in
what,
now
they're
all
members
of
the
same
organization?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
then,
do
we
have
any
case
here
at
all?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
i
understand
that
the
merger,
the
four
unions,
aren't
there
four?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
what's
the
surviving?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
engineers,
and
what's
the
name
of
the
new
one?
united
trans
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
they're
all
members
of
the
same
union?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
four
are,
now
we
have
a
five
here
whether
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
but
as
to
the
unions
before
us,
the
issue
as
i
understood
it
was
whether
it
satisfied
the
requirement
of
the
union
shop
clause
that
one
is
a
member
of
the
switchmen
rather
than
the
railroad
trainmen.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
was
the
question,
and
now
the
situation
is
that
both
--
one
of
them
was
formerly
switchmen,
one
was
formerly
trainmen
are
now
members
of
the
same
union
and
how
can
there
be
an
issue
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
know
but
wouldn't
this
be
a
question
of
mootness?
you
know
what
--
this
is
a
federal
case,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
if
it's
moot,
of
course
we
wipe
out
everything,
the
whole
slate
is
wiped
out
clean
all
the
way
back
to
the
beginning.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
everything.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
they're
not
here.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
a
constitutional
question,
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but,
mr.
uelmen.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
expect,
as
justice
fortas
suggested,
this
ins
--
this
case
may
not
be
moot.
but,
if
you're
familiar
with
monrosa
and
cases
of
that
kind
where
there
have
been
events,
occurrences
since
the
grant
of
certiorari
which
make
it,
in
our
judgment,
a
case
not
to
be
decided,
we
dismiss
it
as
improperly
granted.
and,
i
expect
that's
the
choice
here,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
whether
or
not
this
issue
ought
to
be
decided
in
the
context
just
to
the
money
claim,
or
weight
an
actual
application
of
the
same
sort
of
thing
in
some
contest
between
this
new
union
and
the
engineers.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
that
wouldn't
be
what
would
happen
if
the
writ
would
simply
be
dismissed
as
improperly
granted
and
the
judgment
below
would
stay.
that's
what
--
that's
the
choice,
i
expect.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
uelmen,
i
think,
on
occasions,
you
had
observed
in
opinions
the
railway
labor
legislation
as,
really,
collectively
bargained
a
business
between
carriers
and
unions
and
congress
just
puts
it's
simple
matter
on
it.
was
that
true
of
these
amendments?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
does
that
have
any
bearing
on
whether
we
should
read
this
language
literary
or
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
this
is
considerably
different
language
in
the
trainmen
represe
--
recommended
though,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
been
dismissed?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
do
you
have
any
idea
how
much
money
there
is
involved
in
this?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
uelmen,
do
i
correctly
understand?
your
adversary
is
suggesting
that
perhaps
none
of
these
dues
was
collected
from
anyone
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
lower
class
of
200
or
300?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
one,
i
misunderstood
what
you
said.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
must
have
misunderstood
you.
in
other
words,
although
not
compelled,
some
may
have
paid,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
do
you
know
of
any
who
in
fact
paid,
as
mr.
uelmen
has
suggested?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,

yes.
