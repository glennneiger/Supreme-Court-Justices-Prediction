how
can
we
get
a
case
in
time
to
reverse
if
both
of
you
represent
the
same
client?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
can.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
when
--
when
these
unions
merged,
were
there
any
considerations
given
to
you
in
one
of
these
cases?
couldn't
they
have
all
been
worked
out
then?
why
do
you
leave
it
until
its
last
moment
and
then
drop
it
in
our
way?
why?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
long
has
it
been
--
the
--
i
think
i
would
appreciate
the
unions
don't
merge
overnight.
this
had
been
going
on
for
quite
a
while.
justice
thurgood
marshall
right.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
in
the
part
of
that
--
weren't
these
two
cases
deci
--
discussed?
justice
thurgood
marshall
were
they
discussed?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
couldn't
they
had
been
settled
within
the
same
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
then,
we
wouldn't
have
any
troubles.
so
now,
instead
of
doing
that
on
your
own,
you're
asking
us
to
find
someway
to
get
the
case
back
to
the
other
court
so
this
can
be
litigated
all
over
again,
is
that
your
position?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
we
don't
have
anybody
versus
anybody
here.
we
have
the
union
versus
the
same
union.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
who
represents
now?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
just
told
me
you
represented
your
union.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
what
you
told
me,
isn't
it?
