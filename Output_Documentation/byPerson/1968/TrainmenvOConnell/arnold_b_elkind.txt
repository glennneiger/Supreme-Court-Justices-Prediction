mr.
arnold
b.
elkind
may
it
please
the
court,
chief
justice
warren.
if
the
court
will
indulge
me
by
looking
at
the
title
of
the
proceedings
before
the
court,
there
are
some
matters
which
it's
incumbent
upon
me
to
call
to
the
attention
of
the
court
since
they
may
in
the
court's
mind
be
relevant
to
the
issue
of
constitutional
power
to
hear
argument
in
the
case
or
at
least
to
decide
the
case.
a
title
that
reads
brotherhood
of
railroad
trainmen,
an
unincorporated
association,
that
should
be
correctly
stated
in
terms
of
the
contemporary
events,
the
united
transportation
union,
an
unincorporated
association.
and
reading
down
through
the
respondents,
the
court
will
find
that
the
switchmen's
union
of
north
america,
afl-cio
is
a
respondent
in
the
original
proceeding
and
also
that
the
order
of
railway
conductors
and
brakemen
are
respondents.
those
two
responding
unions
have
now
merged
with
the
brotherhood
of
railroad
trainmen.
mr.
arnold
b.
elkind
i
wish
there
were
because
--
mr.
arnold
b.
elkind
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
arnold
b.
elkind
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to
the
--
i
don't
want
to
say
yes
but
there
is
a
serious
question.
i
don't
want
to
say
no.
mr.
arnold
b.
elkind
there
are
four
unions,
yes.
mr.
arnold
b.
elkind
the
other
union
of
the
engineers.
mr.
arnold
b.
elkind
united
transportation
union.
mr.
arnold
b.
elkind
the
four
are.
mr.
arnold
b.
elkind
and
the
engineers
union.
mr.
arnold
b.
elkind
the
only
union
that
is
not
a
part
of
the
utu
has
filed
a
brief
amicus
curiae
with
the
position.
mr.
arnold
b.
elkind
that
was
the
question.
mr.
arnold
b.
elkind
no
but
the
union
had
an
agreement
with
the
erie
lackawanna
railroad
and
there
is
in
existence
a
judgment
in
the
u.s.
district
court
affirmed
through
the
court
of
appeals
which
holds
that
agreement
to
be
void,
invalid
and
of
no
effect.
and
it's
on
--
mr.
arnold
b.
elkind
it
is.
mr.
arnold
b.
elkind
including
the
original
--
mr.
arnold
b.
elkind
they
are
the
fourth,
yes.
mr.
arnold
b.
elkind
that's
right,
judge
white.
mr.
arnold
b.
elkind
no,
they
filed
briefs.
mr.
arnold
b.
elkind
that
is
--
mr.
arnold
b.
elkind
right.
mr.
arnold
b.
elkind
they
are
not.
mr.
arnold
b.
elkind
it's
very
unusual
situation.
unfortunately
--
mr.
arnold
b.
elkind
no,
perhaps
it
would
be
appropriate
if
he
were
heard.
i
don't
know
quite
what
his
position
would
be
but
i
--
perhaps
the
court
would
want
to
know
preliminarily
what
mr.
leibik's
position
is
here.
it
was
obviously
brought
--
mr.
arnold
b.
elkind
there
were
no
--
there
was
no
suit
for
damages
but
there
were
no
damages.
mr.
arnold
b.
elkind
well
there
were
none
entered,
the
judge
does
not
provide
for
any
damages
in
any
event.
mr.
arnold
b.
elkind
that's
why
the
court
--
it
matter
to
the
court's
attention.
mr.
arnold
b.
elkind
and
the
only
point
i
would
like
to
make
in
addition
to
those
that
have
been
averted
to
by
the
court
on
this
constitutional
question
is
that
we
have
the
strange
situation
in
the
railway
labor
act
that
a
railroad
will
be
subject
to
a
fine
or
a
criminal
penalty
if
they
enter
into
this
kind
of
an
agreement
and
it
was
approximately
15
years
as
far
as
i
can
make
out
before
a
strict
union
shop
agreement
was
finally
worked
out
between
labor
and
management,
now
here
we
are
and
on
the
very
eve
of
having
the
issue
adjudicated.
apparently
we've
lost
our
adversary
position.
there
is
nobody
--
mr.
arnold
b.
elkind
there
is
nobody
--
yes
it
is
i
think.
there
is
nobody
here
as
far
as
i
know
to
argue
on
the
other
side
unless
mr.
leibik
who
appears
here
for
the
respondent
as
appearing
for
them
and
unless
he
claims
that
they
have
an
individual
right
not
to
pay
--
not
to
pay
dues
under
union
shop
--
under
the
union
shop
agreement
that
was
made
here.
i
don't
know
whether
that's
his
position
or
not.
otherwise
there
is
no
--
mr.
arnold
b.
elkind
my
clients,
the
utu
and
the
engineer's
unions
are
all
the
five
operating
unions
that
are
affected
by
this
agreement
would
like
this
issue
to
be
resolved.
that
is
the
reason
why
i
am
here.
they
would
like
the
--
they
would
like
to
have
the
--
that
the
only
reason
why
there
should
be
any
deviation
from
a
strict
union
shop
as
to
accommodate
the
realities
of
intercraft
transfers
so
that
the
only
appropriate
situation
for
such
a
provision
would
be
where
there
is
both
an
engineer's
contract
on
the
property
and
a
utu
contract
and
there
in
those
--
in
that
situation,
we
would
like
to
see
the
intercraft
mobility
accommodated.
mr.
arnold
b.
elkind
well,
i
would
say
that
there
is
not
a
--
i
would
have
to
admit
that
technically
speaking,
there
does
not
appear
to
be
a
controversy.
i
have
not
heard
anyone
arguing
on
behalf
of
the
other
side
and
that
by
my
standards
is
basic
to
a
controversy.
mr.
arnold
b.
elkind
yes,
i
am
now.
mr.
arnold
b.
elkind
now
i
might
say
this,
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court
that
in
the
next
case
that
is
to
be
heard
which
arose
from
the
seventh
circuit,
there
is
a
variation
in
the
fact
pattern
and
that
it
is
claimed
as
i
understand
it
that
there
is
a
damage
claim
outstanding
and
that
therefore
the
court
may
very
well
find
that
there
is
a
justiciable
controversy
in
that
other
case
and
so
that
we
could
perhaps
get
to
the
main
issue
in
the
seventh
circuit
case.
but
as
the
matter
stands
now,
i
assume
that
if
the
case
is
treated
as
moot,
that
the
original
judgment
will
be
vacated
in
the
district
court
in
any
event.
mr.
arnold
b.
elkind
thank
you.
mr.
arnold

is
