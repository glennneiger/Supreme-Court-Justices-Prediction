mr.
david
l.
uelmen
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
as
of
january
1,
1969,
we
have
no
independent
clients
having
continuing
interest
in
this
litigation.
there
are
no
damage
claims
pending.
we
received
injunctive
relief
prior
to
the
effective
date
of
the
agreements
here
in
question
and
we
would
ask
this
court
to
consider
the
matter
on
the
record
and
on
the
brief
submitted.
mr.
david
l.
uelmen
we
represent
the
united
transportation
union
because
the
order
of
railway
conductors
and
brakemen
and
switchmen's
union
of
north
america
has
now
been
merged
into
united
transportation
union
and
we
do
not
believe
there
is
a
judicial
controversy
before
this
court.
mr.
david
l.
uelmen
yes.
they
have
no
continuing
interest
simply
because
there
were
no
damages
alleged
in
the
complaint
on
behalf
of
any
individual.
there
are
no
damages
incurred
of
course
because
we
did
receive
injunctive
relief
prior
to
the
effective
date
of
this
agreement.
mr.
david
l.
uelmen
yes,
certainly.
mr.
david
l.
uelmen
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
does
present
the
same
legal
issue
that
was
presented
in
the
previous
case,
although
the
language
of
the
contrary
is
slightly
different.
and,
there
--
in
our
opinion,
there
is
no
mootness
problem
here
and,
to
that
end,
we
did
file
the
supplemental
brief
a
few
days
ago,
to
which
i
believe
justice
fortas
referred
earlier.
mr.
david
l.
uelmen
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
david
l.
uelmen
well,
of
course,
the
merger
facts
didn’t
exist
at
that
--
mr.
david
l.
uelmen
you
mean,
because
the
amount
of
dues
paid
to
the
brotherhood
by
the
individual
claimants
and
their
class
was
a
small
amount
of
money?
mr.
david
l.
uelmen
well,
the
difference
--
mr.
david
l.
uelmen
well,
there
was
a
small
money
judgment
involved
in
the
felter
case
against
the
southern
pacific
also
because
it
involved
only
the
check
off
dues
of
one
particular
man.
mr.
david
l.
uelmen
and,
in
this
case
--
mr.
david
l.
uelmen
the
difference
in
this
case
and
in
the
previous
case,
of
course,
is
that
there
was
no
restraining
order
issued
in
this
case.
the
effort
to
obtain
the
restraining
order
failed
and,
as
a
result,
the
plaintiff
and
his
class
were
compelled
to
join
the
brotherhood
of
railroad
trainmen,
and
they
were
compelled
to
pay
dues
to
the
brotherhood
of
railroad
trainmen.
and,
when
the
appeal
was
pending
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit,
those
plaintiffs
argued
to
that
court
that
they
wanted
the
case
remanded
to
the
trial
court
for
the
purpose
of
having
their
dues
money
that
they
had
paid
to
the
brotherhood
restored
to
them.
and
that
issue,
of
course,
the
issue
of
money
damages,
still
makes
this
a
live
issue
or
a
case
of
controversy
for
this
court
because
even
if
this
court
does,
pursuant
to
a
mootness
point,
reverse
and
remand
it
and
vacate
the
judgment,
then
these
individual
plaintiffs
and
the
class
that
they
represent
will
not
be
restored
to
the
dues
that
they
paid
and
would
still
have
the
claim
for
that
money.
mr.
david
l.
uelmen
excuse
me.
mr.
david
l.
uelmen
well,
--
mr.
david
l.
uelmen
well,
i
think
that
if
the
case
is
remanded
to
the
lower
court,
the
federal
rules
--
mr.
david
l.
uelmen
and
then
--
but
there
are
still
proceedings
to
go
on
in
the
lower
court
if
that
would
happen.
mr.
david
l.
uelmen
well,
yes.
the
individuals
would
certainly
assert
their
or
have
the
right
to
if
they
so
desire
--
mr.
david
l.
uelmen
and
i
think,
under
the
class
action
rules
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure,
each
member
of
that
class
would
have
to
be
notified
that
the
court
intends
to
act
on
their
claims
and
they
would
have
the
right
to
say,
well,
whether
they
waive
them
or
not.
and,
from
the
letters
that
we
have
received
and
the
protests
that
were
filed
at
the
time
they
paid
the
dues,
we
have
no
reason
to
believe
that
these
members
are
going
to
waive
that
in
those
claims.
they
were
not
happy
at
all
and
--
by
being
compelled
to
join
the
brotherhood.
mr.
david
l.
uelmen
well,
the
individual
plaintiffs
are
six
in
number
and
they
purport
to
represent
a
class
and,
frankly,
that
actual
damage
issue
was
never
tried.
so,
it
could
be
several
hundred.
i
would
say
an
estim
--
probably
between
200
and
300
that
were
compelled
to
join
the
brotherhood
and
were
not
pleased
about
it.
if
the
court
please,
the
court
below
--
mr.
david
l.
uelmen
well,
we
won
the
case
in
district
court
and,
so
then,
the
men,
of
course,
were
compelled
to
join
the
brotherhood.
now,
some
of
them
remained
members
of
the
switchmen
also.
in
other
words,
were
members
of
two
unions,
and
then,
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
the
district
court
--
mr.
david
l.
uelmen
well,
i
think
some
of
them
did,
yes.
mr.
david
l.
uelmen
well,
--
mr.
david
l.
uelmen
there
was
no
stay
issue,
no.
mr.
david
l.
uelmen
and
then,
of
course,
we
filed
a
petition
for
cert
here.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
held
that
section
211
(c)
of
the
railway
labor
act
must
be
read
literary
and
that
the
legislative
history
supports
the
literal
reading
of
that
statute.
the
court
also
noted
and
stated
that,
in
this
judgment,
the
opinion
of
this
court
in
rychlik
versus
pennsylvania
railroad
which
construed
the
legislative
history
differently
was
dictum
on
that
point.
and
they
also
held
that
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
in
the
third
circuit
in
rohrer
versus
the
black
lick
railroad
was
inapplicable
because
that
railroad
was
owned
by
a
steel
company
and
was
organized
on
an
industrial
basis.
and,
with
those
positions
and
with
that
reasoning
of
the
court
below,
of
course,
we
disagree.
the
legislative
history
of
this
law
shows
clearly
that
congress
intended
the
railway
unions
to
have
a
union
shop
agreement
just
like
the
industrial
unions
had.
the
one
problem
that
kept
coming
out
and
being
debated
was
what
they
were
going
to
do
with
the
operating
unions
as
distinguished
from
the
non-operating
unions
because,
in
the
operating
crafts,
there
was
this
craft
progression
from
fireman
to
engineer
and
back
again
to
fireman,
and
between
conductor
and
break
man
and
back
again
to
break
man,
and
that
argument
was
debated
in
congress
at
some
length,
and
different
proposals
where
made
at
various
stages
of
legislative
history.
at
one
time,
the
proposal
was
made
that
perhaps
the
parties
could
just
negotiate
it
out,
and
that
wasn't
satisfactory.
another
time,
a
proposal
was
made
similar
to
what
we
did
here
that
the
man
would
have
to
be
a
member
of
the
union
that
held
the
bargaining
march,
and
that
proposal
was
not
adopted
in
that
form.
another
was
a
proposal
to
simply
issue
a
general
prohibition
on
requiring
membership
in
more
than
one
union.
now,
in
the
final
analysis,
everyone
agreed
to
one
very
important
point,
and
that
is
that
the
only
item
they
wanted
to
correct,
the
only
difference
that
they
wanted
in
this
particular
bill
was
to
correct
the
problem
of
compelling
a
man
to
become
a
member
of
more
than
one
union.
they
felt
that
a
man
should
not
be
forced
to
pay
dues
to
one
union.
the
congress
was
willing
to
permit
the
union
the
employer
to
compel
and
to
pay
dues
to
the
union
--
to
one
union,
but
they
didn't
want
him
to
pay
union
dues
to
two.
and,
with
that
concept
in
mind
and
with
that
overall
objective,
the
language
was
agreed
to
by
the
various
unions
and,
ultimately,
adopted
by
congress.
and,
this
court
exhaustedly
analyzed
the
legislative
history
on
that
section
in
the
rychlik
case
and
held
that
the
--
that
that
legislative
history
must
be
read
carefully
in
order
to
understand
the
exact
language
of
the
con
--
of
the
statute,
and
that
the
statute
itself
could
not
be
read
literary
on
its
face.
and,
this
court
held
and
it
state
--
and
it
adhered
to
those
holdings
in
the
street
case
and
in
the
felter
case
that
the
statutory
language
must
be
read
in
the
light
of
solving
this
problem
and
that
problem,
we
agree
with
and
we
have
incorporated
into
our
collective
bargaining
agreement
specific
language
which
states
that
if
the
man
has
a
right
to
work
in
another
craft
such
as
a
conductor,
and
if
the
conductors
have
a
contract
with
the
railroad
under
which
compulsory
union
is
a
factor,
he
can
become
a
member
and
remain
a
member
of
the
conductor's
union.
that,
we
say
--
we
assert
to
the
court,
solves
the
problem
of
what
congress
was
trying
to
reach,
and
that
is,
the
man
cannot
be
compelled
to
become
a
member
of
two.
but,
what
does
the
switchman's
union's
have
on
the
milwaukee
road?
it
has
no
contracts.
it
cannot
negotiate
a
contract.
it
had
never
did
have
a
contract
since
the
railway
labor
act
was
passed,
and
it
would
be
impossible
for
that
union
to
negotiate
a
contract
with
the
employer
that
would
compel
the
man
to
become
a
member
of
the
switchman's
union.
and,
with
that
in
mind,
we
have
asserted
that
the
legislative
purposes
served
by
compelling
the
man
to
become
and
remain
a
member
of
the
union
that
bargains
for
him
and
if
the
union
does
not
bargain
for
him,
the
--
if
the
union
is
just
a
stranger
to
the
property,
which
was
switchman's
union
was
in
this
railroad,
that
membership
in
that
union
could
not
be
used
to
satisfy
the
union
shop
requirements.
mr.
david
l.
uelmen
you
mean,
with
specific
--
mr.
david
l.
uelmen
no,
your
honor,
there's
nothing
specific
on
that.
i
think
that
it
is
consistent
with
the
union
shop
legislation
itself
though.
mr.
david
l.
uelmen
the
language
of
the
act
literary
read,
of
course,
and
if
the
language
had
literary
read,
some
modification
would
have
to
be
made
in
the
rychlik
language,
and
--
mr.
david
l.
uelmen
well,
rychlik
said
in
the
--
several
times,
of
course,
that
the
language
could
not
be
read
literary,
that
it
had
to
be
read
in
the
light
of
solving
a
problem
with
compulsive
--
mr.
david
l.
uelmen
yes,
that
--
and,
of
course,
there
are
a
very
few
railroads
in
the
united
states
in
which
the
railroad
is
organized
on
a
what
we
call
a
perfect
basis
where
the
engineer
represents
only
the
engineer
and
the
fireman
only
the
fireman
and
so
on
down
the
line.
and,
it's
true
that
the
legislative
history
didn't
consider
that
problem
specifically,
but
it
would
be
inconsistent
with
the
overall
provisions
of
the
union
shop
agreement
and
the
union
shop
statute
to
permit
a
man
to
satisfy
the
compulsory
union
features
of
the
statute
by
becoming
a
member
of
the
union
that
cannot
and
does
not
bargain
for
him.
mr.
david
l.
uelmen
oh,
yes.
mr.
david
l.
uelmen
yes,
that's
true.
they
used
very
broad
language.
well,
of
course,
how
else
are
we
going
to
solve
a
problem
of
a
dual
union
situation?
that
was
really
the
tough
problem
that
they
faced.
what
language
is
there
that
they
could
adopt
which
would
make
the
man
join
at
least
one
union,
but
not
make
him
join
two?
and,
this
was
the
subject
of
considerable
debate
in
congress
but
the
overall
picture
was,
i
think,
clearly
in
the
legislative
history,
shows
that
that
was
on
the
only
problem
--
mr.
david
l.
uelmen
well,
except
that
--
mr.
david
l.
uelmen
well,
no,
because
you
may
have
a
situation
like
it
is
true
on
the
milwaukee
road
where
they
trainmen
and
the
conductors
each
have
a
contract,
and
the
trainmen
do
work
as
conductors
from
time
to
time.
they
are
assigned
to
that
job.
mr.
david
l.
uelmen
and,
of
course,
the
purpose
of
this
language
of
the
statute
was
to
permit
the
man,
eventhough
he
was
employed
as
a
trainman
perhaps
the
majority
of
the
time,
to
be
a
member
of
the
conductor's
union,
if
he
chose
to
do
so,
as
long
as
he
had
the
right
to
work
under
that
--
mr.
david
l.
uelmen
that's
true,
your
honor,
and
i
think
though
that
the
rychlik
opinion
pointed
the
way
clearly
in
that
direction
and
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
rohrer
versus
black
lick
made
it
very
plain
that
that
is
exactly
the
way
it's
certain
to
work
and
it
only
makes
labor
relations
sense
to
work
to
have
the
man
belong
to
the
union
that
must
do
his
bargaining,
that
is
obligated
under
the
duties
of
fair
representation
and
all
the
rest
to
defend
him.
mr.
david
l.
uelmen
i
think
that
there
was
an
agreement
between
the
five
operating
brotherhoods
on
this
language.
i
understand
the
engineer
had
a
different
version
of
it
from
time
to
time,
but
--
mr.
david
l.
uelmen
well,
i
--
there
is
no
place
in
this
record
or
anywhere
else
that
i
can
find
that's
going
to
--
for
someone
to
say,
“well,
i
was
there
at
the
time
that
language
was
drafted
and
we
intended
a
man
to
be
able
to
be
a
member
of
any
one
of
the
five
unions.”
mr.
david
l.
uelmen
the
language
is
different,
your
honor.
that's
true,
but
the
problem
that
the
language
was
intended
to
solve
was
the
same.
now,
there
was
alternate
proposals
made
as
to
how
they
should
meet
this
problem,
and
i
don't
think
it
was
fair
to
say
that
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
the
trainmen
proposal
was
rejected.
it
was
--
it's
to
strong
to
say
that
because
there
was
a
group
of
men,
contesting
men,
trying
to
solve
one
problem,
and
no
one,
as
i
think
that
justice
harlan
pointed
out,
no
one
had
this
problem
specifically
in
mind.
they
had
the
problem
of
trying
to
avoid
the
situation
where
a
man
would
be
forced,
could
be
compelled
to
join
two
unions,
and
that
problem
is
not
present
unless
both
unions
have
a
contract
because,
unless
the
alternate
union
has
a
contract,
the
man
cannot
be
compelled.
there's
no
--
the
alternate
union
is
a
stranger
to
the
situation.
mr.
david
l.
uelmen
yes,
i
think
that
your
honors
had
that
on
certiorari.
was
denied
yesterday
in
the
mcelroy
case.
that
was
a
case,
as
i
understand
it,
where
the
engineer's
union
holds
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
with
the
railroad,
and
the
firemen's
union
which
does
not
hold
the
contract
did
seek
to
and
did
in
fact
represent
a
particular
man
under
the
engineer's
contract.
mr.
david
l.
uelmen
well,
i
think
that
the
labor
relations
principle
is
fairly
similar,
although
not
identical
because
although
i
can't
argue
with
what
you
did
yesterday,
i
do
say
that
it
doesn't,
again,
make
labor
relation
sense
to
say
to
a
union,
like
the
engineers
who
has
a
contract
with
the
carrier,
“we're
going
to
let
some
other
union
interpret
that
contract,
enforce
that
contract,
settle
grievances
under
that
contract,
and
not
even
have
the
engineers
present
or
on
the
scene
when
that
is
done.”
and,
what
this
case
is
related
in
the
sense
that
what
we're
saying
to
a
man
is
that
“you
have
a
union
that
represents
you
and
you
can
make
him
represent
you.
you
can
force
him
to
represent
you.
you
can
take
him
to
court
to
be
sure
that
he
doesn't
represent
you
unfairly,
but
we're
going
to
let
him
pay
his
dues
to
somebody
else,”
and
that's
the
evil
that
we're
getting
at
in
this
argument.
thank
you,
your
honors.
mr.
david
l.
uelmen
just
one
minute,
your
honor.
to
answer
your
question,
justice
black,
if
the
case
is
remanded
and
vacated,
similar
to
the
preceding
case,
and
if
that
is
the
end
of
it,
of
course,
nobody
will
have
any
problems.
but,
it
does
seem
to
me
that
because
the
plaintiff
pleads
a
representative
suit
here,
a
class
action,
it
does
seem
to
me
that
when
it
goes
back
to
the
district
court,
that
class
under
the
federal
rules
is
going
to
have
to
be
circularized
in
some
fashion
to
find
out
if
they
want
to
have
their
dues
refunded
because
they
certainly
claimed
that
in
the
case
so
far.
and,
if
the
individuals
do
claim
that
they
want
their
dues
refunded,
as
far
as
i
know,
the
united
transportation
workers
union
is
not
going
to
just
write
them
out
check,
and
we're
going
to
back
in
the
--
mr.
david
l.
uelmen
no,
i
cannot
honestly
say
that,
your
honor.
i
think
the
sum
is
fairly
small.
i
would
doubt
that
it
would
be
more
than
a
couple
of
thousand
dollars.
mr.
david
l.
uelmen
well,
if
all
of
the
claims
would
be
dropped,
if
--
i
think
that
if
counsel
for
the
respondents
here
could
say
that
he's
authorized
to
drop
all
claims,
that
would
be
the
same
situation
as
a
previous
case,
but
--
mr.
david
l.
uelmen
is
it
all
--
it
would
also
be
possible
to,
if
you
did
that,
to
cite
the
rychlik
versus
pennsylvania
railroad.
mr.
david
l.
uelmen
no.
mr.
david
l.
uelmen
no,
the
dues
were
definitely
collected
and
we
printed
in
our
appendix
to
the
--
just
one
letter
that
we
received
from
a
man
who
made
it
very
plain
that
he
was
unhappy
about
joining
and
there
was,
just
literally,
dozens
and
dozens
of
protests
made
when
the
man
came
in
and
paid
his
dues,
“i'm
paying
under
protest,”
that
some
of
the
checks
appeared,
under
paid,
under
protest.
mr.
david
l.
uelmen
well,
the
merger
was
in
effect
on
january
1
of
this
year,
your
honor,
but
--
mr.
david
l.
uelmen
as
a
matter
of
fact,
merger
of
these
unions
have
been
talked
about
for
years
and
years.
mr.
david
l.
uelmen
but,
specifically,
in
this
--
mr.
david
l.
uelmen
they
where
not
settled
in
the
merger
at
all.
mr.
david
l.
uelmen
your
honor,
i
really
don't
know
because
i
--
mr.
david
l.
uelmen
well,
i
suppose
it's
possible
for
them
to
have
settled,
yes.
mr.
david
l.
uelmen
no,
your
honor,
we're
asking
you
to
reverse
the
case
based
upon
the
precedence
here
of
rychlik
versus
pennsylvania
railroad
and
the
auth
--
and
the
--
mr.
david
l.
uelmen
no,
your
honor.
there
are
individual
plaintiffs
here,
named
individually
and
purporting
to
represent
a
clash.
that's
the
only
difference
between
our
case
and
the
--
mr.
david
l.
uelmen
well,
mr.
leibik
represented
--
mr.
david
l.
uelmen
well,
your
honor,
in
that
--
mr.
david
l.
uelmen
i
think
you
put
your
finger
right
on
the
problem
because,
in
that
case,
those
individual
plaintiffs
are
unrepresented
at
this
point.
mr.
david
l.
uelmen
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
david
l.
uelmen
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
david
l.
uelmen
mr.
chief
justice,
may
i
clarify
one
point
--
mr.
david
l.
uelmen
to
justice
brennan.
justice
brennan,
i
refer
to
the
fact
that
no
employee
of
the
milwaukee
railroad
was
compelled
to
drop
his
membership
in
the
switchmen's
union
and
join
the
brotherhood
of
railroad
trainmen
because
of
the
issuance
of
a
bulletin
--
mr.
david
l.
uelmen
correct.
mr.
david
l.
uelmen
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
as
of
january
1,
1969,
we
have
no
independent
clients
having
continuing
interest
in
this
litigation.
there
are
no
damage
claims
pending.
we
received
injunctive
relief
prior
to
the
effective
date
of
the
agreements
here
in
question
and
we
would
ask
this
court
to
consider
the
matter
on
the
record
and
on
the
brief
submitted.
mr.
david
l.
uelmen
we
represent
the
united
transportation
union
because
the
order
of
railway
conductors
and
brakemen
and
switchmen's
union
of
north
america
has
now
been
merged
into
united
transportation
union
and
we
do
not
believe
there
is
a
judicial
controversy
before
this
court.
mr.
david
l.
uelmen
yes.
they
have
no
continuing
interest
simply
because
there
were
no
damages
alleged
in
the
complaint
on
behalf
of
any
individual.
there
are
no
damages
incurred
of
course
because
we
did
receive
injunctive
relief
prior
to
the
effective
date
of
this
agreement.
mr.
david
l.
uelmen
yes,
certainly.
mr.
david
l.
uelmen
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
does
present
the
same
legal
issue
that
was
presented
in
the
previous
case,
although
the
language
of
the
contrary
is
slightly
different.
and,
there
--
in
our
opinion,
there
is
no
mootness
problem
here
and,
to
that
end,
we
did
file
the
supplemental
brief
a
few
days
ago,
to
which
i
believe
justice
fortas
referred
earlier.
mr.
david
l.
uelmen
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
david
l.
uelmen
well,
of
course,
the
merger
facts
didn’t
exist
at
that
--
mr.
david
l.
uelmen
you
mean,
because
the
amount
of
dues
paid
to
the
brotherhood
by
the
individual
claimants
and
their
class
was
a
small
amount
of
money?
mr.
david
l.
uelmen
well,
the
difference
--
mr.
david
l.
uelmen
well,
there
was
a
small
money
judgment
involved
in
the
felter
case
against
the
southern
pacific
also
because
it
involved
only
the
check
off
dues
of
one
particular
man.
mr.
david
l.
uelmen
and,
in
this
case
--
mr.
david
l.
uelmen
the
difference
in
this
case
and
in
the
previous
case,
of
course,
is
that
there
was
no
restraining
order
issued
in
this
case.
the
effort
to
obtain
the
restraining
order
failed
and,
as
a
result,
the
plaintiff
and
his
class
were
compelled
to
join
the
brotherhood
of
railroad
trainmen,
and
they
were
compelled
to
pay
dues
to
the
brotherhood
of
railroad
trainmen.
and,
when
the
appeal
was
pending
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit,
those
plaintiffs
argued
to
that
court
that
they
wanted
the
case
remanded
to
the
trial
court
for
the
purpose
of
having
their
dues
money
that
they
had
paid
to
the
brotherhood
restored
to
them.
and
that
issue,
of
course,
the
issue
of
money
damages,
still
makes
this
a
live
issue
or
a
case
of
controversy
for
this
court
because
even
if
this
court
does,
pursuant
to
a
mootness
point,
reverse
and
remand
it
and
vacate
the
judgment,
then
these
individual
plaintiffs
and
the
class
that
they
represent
will
not
be
restored
to
the
dues
that
they
paid
and
would
still
have
the
claim
for
that
money.
mr.
david
l.
uelmen
excuse
me.
mr.
david
l.
uelmen
well,
--
mr.
david
l.
uelmen
well,
i
think
that
if
the
case
is
remanded
to
the
lower
court,
the
federal
rules
--
mr.
david
l.
uelmen
and
then
--
but
there
are
still
proceedings
to
go
on
in
the
lower
court
if
that
would
happen.
mr.
david
l.
uelmen
well,
yes.
the
individuals
would
certainly
assert
their
or
have
the
right
to
if
they
so
desire
--
mr.
david
l.
uelmen
and
i
think,
under
the
class
action
rules
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure,
each
member
of
that
class
would
have
to
be
notified
that
the
court
intends
to
act
on
their
claims
and
they
would
have
the
right
to
say,
well,
whether
they
waive
them
or
not.
and,
from
the
letters
that
we
have
received
and
the
protests
that
were
filed
at
the
time
they
paid
the
dues,
we
have
no
reason
to
believe
that
these
members
are
going
to
waive
that
in
those
claims.
they
were
not
happy
at
all
and
--
by
being
compelled
to
join
the
brotherhood.
mr.
david
l.
uelmen
well,
the
individual
plaintiffs
are
six
in
number
and
they
purport
to
represent
a
class
and,
frankly,
that
actual
damage
issue
was
never
tried.
so,
it
could
be
several
hundred.
i
would
say
an
estim
--
probably
between
200
and
300
that
were
compelled
to
join
the
brotherhood
and
were
not
pleased
about
it.
if
the
court
please,
the
court
below
--
mr.
david
l.
uelmen
well,
we
won
the
case
in
district
court
and,
so
then,
the
men,
of
course,
were
compelled
to
join
the
brotherhood.
now,
some
of
them
remained
members
of
the
switchmen
also.
in
other
words,
were
members
of
two
unions,
and
then,
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
the
district
court
--
mr.
david
l.
uelmen
well,
i
think
some
of
them
did,
yes.
mr.
david
l.
uelmen
well,
--
mr.
david
l.
uelmen
there
was
no
stay
issue,
no.
mr.
david
l.
uelmen
and
then,
of
course,
we
filed
a
petition
for
cert
here.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
held
that
section
211
(c)
of
the
railway
labor
act
must
be
read
literary
and
that
the
legislative
history
supports
the
literal
reading
of
that
statute.
the
court
also
noted
and
stated
that,
in
this
judgment,
the
opinion
of
this
court
in
rychlik
versus
pennsylvania
railroad
which
construed
the
legislative
history
differently
was
dictum
on
that
point.
and
they
also
held
that
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
in
the
third
circuit
in
rohrer
versus
the
black
lick
railroad
was
inapplicable
because
that
railroad
was
owned
by
a
steel
company
and
was
organized
on
an
industrial
basis.
and,
with
those
positions
and
with
that
reasoning
of
the
court
below,
of
course,
we
disagree.
the
legislative
history
of
this
law
shows
clearly
that
congress
intended
the
railway
unions
to
have
a
union
shop
agreement
just
like
the
industrial
unions
had.
the
one
problem
that
kept
coming
out
and
being
debated
was
what
they
were
going
to
do
with
the
operating
unions
as
distinguished
from
the
non-operating
unions
because,
in
the
operating
crafts,
there
was
this
craft
progression
from
fireman
to
engineer
and
back
again
to
fireman,
and
between
conductor
and
break
man
and
back
again
to
break
man,
and
that
argument
was
debated
in
congress
at
some
length,
and
different
proposals
where
made
at
various
stages
of
legislative
history.
at
one
time,
the
proposal
was
made
that
perhaps
the
parties
could
just
negotiate
it
out,
and
that
wasn't
satisfactory.
another
time,
a
proposal
was
made
similar
to
what
we
did
here
that
the
man
would
have
to
be
a
member
of
the
union
that
held
the
bargaining
march,
and
that
proposal
was
not
adopted
in
that
form.
another
was
a
proposal
to
simply
issue
a
general
prohibition
on
requiring
membership
in
more
than
one
union.
now,
in
the
final
analysis,
everyone
agreed
to
one
very
important
point,
and
that
is
that
the
only
item
they
wanted
to
correct,
the
only
difference
that
they
wanted
in
this
particular
bill
was
to
correct
the
problem
of
compelling
a
man
to
become
a
member
of
more
than
one
union.
they
felt
that
a
man
should
not
be
forced
to
pay
dues
to
one
union.
the
congress
was
willing
to
permit
the
union
the
employer
to
compel
and
to
pay
dues
to
the
union
--
to
one
union,
but
they
didn't
want
him
to
pay
union
dues
to
two.
and,
with
that
concept
in
mind
and
with
that
overall
objective,
the
language
was
agreed
to
by
the
various
unions
and,
ultimately,
adopted
by
congress.
and,
this
court
exhaustedly
analyzed
the
legislative
history
on
that
section
in
the
rychlik
case
and
held
that
the
--
that
that
legislative
history
must
be
read
carefully
in
order
to
understand
the
exact
language
of
the
con
--
of
the
statute,
and
that
the
statute
itself
could
not
be
read
literary
on
its
face.
and,
this
court
held
and
it
state
--
and
it
adhered
to
those
holdings
in
the
street
case
and
in
the
felter
case
that
the
statutory
language
must
be
read
in
the
light
of
solving
this
problem
and
that
problem,
we
agree
with
and
we
have
incorporated
into
our
collective
bargaining
agreement
specific
language
which
states
that
if
the
man
has
a
right
to
work
in
another
craft
such
as
a
conductor,
and
if
the
conductors
have
a
contract
with
the
railroad
under
which
compulsory
union
is
a
factor,
he
can
become
a
member
and
remain
a
member
of
the
conductor's
union.
that,
we
say
--
we
assert
to
the
court,
solves
the
problem
of
what
congress
was
trying
to
reach,
and
that
is,
the
man
cannot
be
compelled
to
become
a
member
of
two.
but,
what
does
the
switchman's
union's
have
on
the
milwaukee
road?
it
has
no
contracts.
it
cannot
negotiate
a
contract.
it
had
never
did
have
a
contract
since
the
railway
labor
act
was
passed,
and
it
would
be
impossible
for
that
union
to
negotiate
a
contract
with
the
employer
that
would
compel
the
man
to
become
a
member
of
the
switchman's
union.
and,
with
that
in
mind,
we
have
asserted
that
the
legislative
purposes
served
by
compelling
the
man
to
become
and
remain
a
member
of
the
union
that
bargains
for
him
and
if
the
union
does
not
bargain
for
him,
the
--
if
the
union
is
just
a
stranger
to
the
property,
which
was
switchman's
union
was
in
this
railroad,
that
membership
in
that
union
could
not
be
used
to
satisfy
the
union
shop
requirements.
mr.
david
l.
uelmen
you
mean,
with
specific
--
mr.
david
l.
uelmen
no,
your
honor,
there's
nothing
specific
on
that.
i
think
that
it
is
consistent
with
the
union
shop
legislation
itself
though.
mr.
david
l.
uelmen
the
language
of
the
act
literary
read,
of
course,
and
if
the
language
had
literary
read,
some
modification
would
have
to
be
made
in
the
rychlik
language,
and
--
mr.
david
l.
uelmen
well,
rychlik
said
in
the
--
several
times,
of
course,
that
the
language
could
not
be
read
literary,
that
it
had
to
be
read
in
the
light
of
solving
a
problem
with
compulsive
--
mr.
david
l.
uelmen
yes,
that
--
and,
of
course,
there
are
a
very
few
railroads
in
the
united
states
in
which
the
railroad
is
organized
on
a
what
we
call
a
perfect
basis
where
the
engineer
represents
only
the
engineer
and
the
fireman
only
the
fireman
and
so
on
down
the
line.
and,
it's
true
that
the
legislative
history
didn't
consider
that
problem
specifically,
but
it
would
be
inconsistent
with
the
overall
provisions
of
the
union
shop
agreement
and
the
union
shop
statute
to
permit
a
man
to
satisfy
the
compulsory
union
features
of
the
statute
by
becoming
a
member
of
the
union
that
cannot
and
does
not
bargain
for
him.
mr.
david
l.
uelmen
oh,
yes.
mr.
david
l.
uelmen
yes,
that's
true.
they
used
very
broad
language.
well,
of
course,
how
else
are
we
going
to
solve
a
problem
of
a
dual
union
situation?
that
was
really
the
tough
problem
that
they
faced.
what
language
is
there
that
they
could
adopt
which
would
make
the
man
join
at
least
one
union,
but
not
make
him
join
two?
and,
this
was
the
subject
of
considerable
debate
in
congress
but
the
overall
picture
was,
i
think,
clearly
in
the
legislative
history,
shows
that
that
was
on
the
only
problem
--
mr.
david
l.
uelmen
well,
except
that
--
mr.
david
l.
uelmen
well,
no,
because
you
may
have
a
situation
like
it
is
true
on
the
milwaukee
road
where
they
trainmen
and
the
conductors
each
have
a
contract,
and
the
trainmen
do
work
as
conductors
from
time
to
time.
they
are
assigned
to
that
job.
mr.
david
l.
uelmen
and,
of
course,
the
purpose
of
this
language
of
the
statute
was
to
permit
the
man,
eventhough
he
was
employed
as
a
trainman
perhaps
the
majority
of
the
time,
to
be
a
member
of
the
conductor's
union,
if
he
chose
to
do
so,
as
long
as
he
had
the
right
to
work
under
that
--
mr.
david
l.
uelmen
that's
true,
your
honor,
and
i
think
though
that
the
rychlik
opinion
pointed
the
way
clearly
in
that
direction
and
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
rohrer
versus
black
lick
made
it
very
plain
that
that
is
exactly
the
way
it's
certain
to
work
and
it
only
makes
labor
relations
sense
to
work
to
have
the
man
belong
to
the
union
that
must
do
his
bargaining,
that
is
obligated
under
the
duties
of
fair
representation
and
all
the
rest
to
defend
him.
mr.
david
l.
uelmen
i
think
that
there
was
an
agreement
between
the
five
operating
brotherhoods
on
this
language.
i
understand
the
engineer
had
a
different
version
of
it
from
time
to
time,
but
--
mr.
david
l.
uelmen
well,
i
--
there
is
no
place
in
this
record
or
anywhere
else
that
i
can
find
that's
going
to
--
for
someone
to
say,
“well,
i
was
there
at
the
time
that
language
was
drafted
and
we
intended
a
man
to
be
able
to
be
a
member
of
any
one
of
the
five
unions.”
mr.
david
l.
uelmen
the
language
is
different,
your
honor.
that's
true,
but
the
problem
that
the
language
was
intended
to
solve
was
the
same.
now,
there
was
alternate
proposals
made
as
to
how
they
should
meet
this
problem,
and
i
don't
think
it
was
fair
to
say
that
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
the
trainmen
proposal
was
rejected.
it
was
--
it's
to
strong
to
say
that
because
there
was
a
group
of
men,
contesting
men,
trying
to
solve
one
problem,
and
no
one,
as
i
think
that
justice
harlan
pointed
out,
no
one
had
this
problem
specifically
in
mind.
they
had
the
problem
of
trying
to
avoid
the
situation
where
a
man
would
be
forced,
could
be
compelled
to
join
two
unions,
and
that
problem
is
not
present
unless
both
unions
have
a
contract
because,
unless
the
alternate
union
has
a
contract,
the
man
cannot
be
compelled.
there's
no
--
the
alternate
union
is
a
stranger
to
the
situation.
mr.
david
l.
uelmen
yes,
i
think
that
your
honors
had
that
on
certiorari.
was
denied
yesterday
in
the
mcelroy
case.
that
was
a
case,
as
i
understand
it,
where
the
engineer's
union
holds
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
with
the
railroad,
and
the
firemen's
union
which
does
not
hold
the
contract
did
seek
to
and
did
in
fact
represent
a
particular
man
under
the
engineer's
contract.
mr.
david
l.
uelmen
well,
i
think
that
the
labor
relations
principle
is
fairly
similar,
although
not
identical
because
although
i
can't
argue
with
what
you
did
yesterday,
i
do
say
that
it
doesn't,
again,
make
labor
relation
sense
to
say
to
a
union,
like
the
engineers
who
has
a
contract
with
the
carrier,
“we're
going
to
let
some
other
union
interpret
that
contract,
enforce
that
contract,
settle
grievances
under
that
contract,
and
not
even
have
the
engineers
present
or
on
the
scene
when
that
is
done.”
and,
what
this
case
is
related
in
the
sense
that
what
we're
saying
to
a
man
is
that
“you
have
a
union
that
represents
you
and
you
can
make
him
represent
you.
you
can
force
him
to
represent
you.
you
can
take
him
to
court
to
be
sure
that
he
doesn't
represent
you
unfairly,
but
we're
going
to
let
him
pay
his
dues
to
somebody
else,”
and
that's
the
evil
that
we're
getting
at
in
this
argument.
thank
you,
your
honors.
mr.
david
l.
uelmen
just
one
minute,
your
honor.
to
answer
your
question,
justice
black,
if
the
case
is
remanded
and
vacated,
similar
to
the
preceding
case,
and
if
that
is
the
end
of
it,
of
course,
nobody
will
have
any
problems.
but,
it
does
seem
to
me
that
because
the
plaintiff
pleads
a
representative
suit
here,
a
class
action,
it
does
seem
to
me
that
when
it
goes
back
to
the
district
court,
that
class
under
the
federal
rules
is
going
to
have
to
be
circularized
in
some
fashion
to
find
out
if
they
want
to
have
their
dues
refunded
because
they
certainly
claimed
that
in
the
case
so
far.
and,
if
the
individuals
do
claim
that
they
want
their
dues
refunded,
as
far
as
i
know,
the
united
transportation
workers
union
is
not
going
to
just
write
them
out
check,
and
we're
going
to
back
in
the
--
mr.
david
l.
uelmen
no,
i
cannot
honestly
say
that,
your
honor.
i
think
the
sum
is
fairly
small.
i
would
doubt
that
it
would
be
more
than
a
couple
of
thousand
dollars.
mr.
david
l.
uelmen
well,
if
all
of
the
claims
would
be
dropped,
if
--
i
think
that
if
counsel
for
the
respondents
here
could
say
that
he's
authorized
to
drop
all
claims,
that
would
be
the
same
situation
as
a
previous
case,
but
--
mr.
david
l.
uelmen
is
it
all
--
it
would
also
be
possible
to,
if
you
did
that,
to
cite
the
rychlik
versus
pennsylvania
railroad.
mr.
david
l.
uelmen
no.
mr.
david
l.
uelmen
no,
the
dues
were
definitely
collected
and
we
printed
in
our
appendix
to
the
--
just
one
letter
that
we
received
from
a
man
who
made
it
very
plain
that
he
was
unhappy
about
joining
and
there
was,
just
literally,
dozens
and
dozens
of
protests
made
when
the
man
came
in
and
paid
his
dues,
“i'm
paying
under
protest,”
that
some
of
the
checks
appeared,
under
paid,
under
protest.
mr.
david
l.
uelmen
well,
the
merger
was
in
effect
on
january
1
of
this
year,
your
honor,
but
--
mr.
david
l.
uelmen
as
a
matter
of
fact,
merger
of
these
unions
have
been
talked
about
for
years
and
years.
mr.
david
l.
uelmen
but,
specifically,
in
this
--
mr.
david
l.
uelmen
they
where
not
settled
in
the
merger
at
all.
mr.
david
l.
uelmen
your
honor,
i
really
don't
know
because
i
--
mr.
david
l.
uelmen
well,
i
suppose
it's
possible
for
them
to
have
settled,
yes.
mr.
david
l.
uelmen
no,
your
honor,
we're
asking
you
to
reverse
the
case
based
upon
the
precedence
here
of
rychlik
versus
pennsylvania
railroad
and
the
auth
--
and
the
--
mr.
david
l.
uelmen
no,
your
honor.
there
are
individual
plaintiffs
here,
named
individually
and
purporting
to
represent
a
clash.
that's
the
only
difference
between
our
case
and
the
--
mr.
david
l.
uelmen
well,
mr.
leibik
represented
--
mr.
david
l.
uelmen
well,
your
honor,
in
that
--
mr.
david
l.
uelmen
i
think
you
put
your
finger
right
on
the
problem
because,
in
that
case,
those
individual
plaintiffs
are
unrepresented
at
this
point.
mr.
david
l.
uelmen
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
david
l.
uelmen
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
david
l.
uelmen
mr.
chief
justice,
may
i
clarify
one
point
--
mr.
david
l.
uelmen
to
justice
brennan.
justice
brennan,
i
refer
to
the
fact
that
no
employee
of
the
milwaukee
railroad
was
compelled
to
drop
his
membership
in
the
switchmen's
union
and
join
the
brotherhood
of
railroad
trainmen
because
of
the
issuance
of
a
bulletin
--
mr.
david
l.
uelmen
correct.
