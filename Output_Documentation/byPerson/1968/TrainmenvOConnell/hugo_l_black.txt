does
that
one
union,
in
the
contract
of
merger,
agree
to
assume
all
the
obligations
of
each
of
the
merged
unions?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
how
could
they
possibly
be
in
a
lawsuit
between
them?
would
anything
go
into
the

treasury?
justice
hugo
l.
black
order
should
be
turned
up
later
which,
i
gather,
is
not
likely
to
be.
that
some
person
has
been
injured
by
this
union

has
been
absorbed
in
the
one
union.

how
could
anyone
be
injured
by
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
understand
it,
speaking
in
somewhat
of
the
language
of
the
six-man
plaintiffs.
what
you're
putting
up
to
is
that
the
snakes
and
the
trainmen's
union
had
become
one,
is
that
right?
justice
hugo
