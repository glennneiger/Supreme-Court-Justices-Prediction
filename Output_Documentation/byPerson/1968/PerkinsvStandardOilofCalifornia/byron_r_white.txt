justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
it
that
the
legal
activity
essential
and
legal
evidence
essential
to
prove
damages
here
or
through
the
violation
or
both?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
saying
that
the
discrimination
between
perkins
and
signal
the
prices
in
which
its
impact
on
the
competition
in
adverse
impact
on
competition
at
the
level,
do
you
mean
perkins
and
signal
is
encompass
with
the
adversary?
justice
byron
r.
white
once
you
show
that
what
else
can
do
you
need
to
show?
you
have
shown
the
discrimination
and
adverse
affect
of
competition
that
the
perkins
and
signal
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
showed
injury
and
(inaudible).
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
this
is
a
--
do
you
think
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
did
it
not
get
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
we
agree
to
you
that
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
here?
that's
been
decided
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
that's
the
argument
of
causation?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
did
signal
sell
to
anybody
or
offered
to
sell
to
anybody
to
--
that
perkins
wanted
to
sell
too?
were
they
in
competition?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
weren't
the
perkins'
interests
--
weren't
the
perkins
--
what
were
the
perkins
interests,
wholesalers
and
what
do
you
call
them
distributors
or
jobbers
or
both?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
wasn't
signal
a
jobber?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
what
i
mean
it
had
a
jobbing
department
if
you
want
to
say
that.
i
mean
it
sold
in
wholesale?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
perkins
sold
a
wholesale?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
were
they
in
competition
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
weren't
speaking
any
--
they
weren't
selling
in
the
same
areas
or
they
weren't
selling
the
same
customer?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
perkins
wouldn't
have
thought
of
selling
one
of
signal's
customers
that
he
could've
gotten?
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
very
odd
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
with
western
but
how
about
generally?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
perkins
wouldn't
--
perkins
could've
gotten
some
of
signal's
customers
that
perkins
wouldn't
have
sold
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
think
it
ever
would
have
wanted
another
one
in
portland?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
you're
just
saying,
here
are
two
wholesalers
of
gasoline,
of
comparable
gasoline
selling
in
the
same
area
and
you're
saying
that
we
should
--
that
we
must
accept
the
fact
they
are
not
in
competition?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
the
court
of
appeals
in
by
deciding
at
the
way
it
did
at
least
implicitly
decide
that
there
was
no
control?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
said
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
it
doesn't
extend
to
fourth
line
situations,
the
act
of
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
wouldn't
have
been
a
fourth
line
situation
if
there'd
been
control?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
and
yet
it
reversed
so
it
just
said
that
--
if
you
said
that
there
--
that
unless
the
control
was
proved
the
act
didn't
reach
this?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
left
open
control
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
they
didn't
at
least
they
didn't
decide
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
without
proving
--
without
proving
control
they
decided
that
this
was
a
fourth
line
situation
covered
by
the
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
now
would
you
say
that
--
and
you
say
that
the
effect
on
the
line
of
commerce
in
which
perkins
was
engaged
is
not
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
he
felt
that
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
2
(a)
doesn't
exist
because
it's
fourth
line?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
petitioner
says,
well,
the
act
says
that
if
there's
an
adverse
effect
on
any
line
of
commerce.
now,
what
about
the
line
of
commerce
and
which
perkins
was
engaged?
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
submitted
in
the
district
court
to
the
jury
and
the
instructions
were
certainly
broad
enough
to
submit
this
issue
to
the
jury?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
it
focus
on
showing
a
lessening
of
competition
with
regal?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
the
verdict.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
regal
--
regal
cut
prices
and
therefore
competition
with
it
was
lessened?
justice
byron
r.
white
instructions
to
the
jury
didn't
focus
on
that
either?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
it
didn't
identify
--
it
didn't
say
--
it
didn't
ask
the
jury
to
focus
on
saying,
you
must
find
that
the
competition
was
regal
was
lessened?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
minority
holders
of
western
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
position,
the
minority
stockholders
of
western
were
also
i
suppose
rather
interested
in
having
accompanied
by
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
the
statute
when
it
says
lessening
competition
in
any
line
of
commerce;
do
you
think
that's
the
same
standard
as
saying
lessening
competition
with
a
customer?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
isn't
it,
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
you
could
have
any
line
of
commerce
could
apply
to
the
fourth
level?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
different
standard
than
just
preventing
or
lessening
competition
with
regal?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
before
you
could
show
a
lessening
competition
with
regal,
the
act
doesn't
cover
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean
that's
what
your
argument
is.
that's
what
the
court
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
you
could
show
lessening
of
competition
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
in
the
line
of
commerce
regal
was
engaged
in
the
act
would
reach
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
the
jury
followed
its
instructions
it
wouldn't
have
found
for
the
plaintiff
on
the
basis
that
competition
with
regal
had
been
lessened,
would
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why?
but
it
must
have
not
called
these
instructions
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
there
wasn't
anything
submitted
to
it
on
basis
of
control
and
if
it
followed
the
evidence
there
was
a
standard,
signal,
western,
regal?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
all
the
instructions
to
it
said
that
was
that
they
got
as
far
as
western
that
stopped
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
if
it
called
these
instructions
then
the
only
way
it
could've
reached
the
result
it
did
was
by
going
on
the
line
of
commerce?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you
think
that
the
jury
decided
to
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
of
the
companies
would
give
it
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
whether
there
was
control
or
not,
i
suppose
signal's
lower
price
was
either
passed
on
western,
and
if
it
wasn't
passed
on,
i
suppose
the
perkins
case
gets
much
covered,
doesn't
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
was
that
issue
put
to
the
jury?
didn't
that
have
to
if
the
jury
--
i
suppose
on
one
theory
of
the
case,
the
jury
would
have
had
to
have
found
that
it
was
passed
on.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
came
out
with
the
verdict
of
perkins.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
this
--
let
me
put
and
ask
something
else.
if
it
was
passed
on
a
regular
basis,
that
doesn't
really
make
much
difference
about
control,
does
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
it
wasn't
passed
on,
it
doesn't
make
any
make
difference
about
the
petroleum.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
how
come
does
regal
get
off
with
selling
at
such
a
low
price?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
it
buy
its
gas
at
a
low
price?
now,
how
does
that
operate?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
it
didn't
--
they
didn't
have
lower
prices?
justice
byron
r.
white
selling
prices.
justice
byron
r.
white
doesn't
the
record
show
what
regal
paying
for
gas?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you're
suggesting
now
that
it's
quite
rational
to
--
rational
in
terms
that
regal
although
selling
it
four
cents
below
what
the
price
was,
nevertheless,
was
paying
the
same
price
for
gas
that
other
people
were.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
just
still
wonder
if
control
is
very
relevant.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
standard's
price
cut
was
passed
on
right
on
through,
passed
right
on
through
at
all
levels,
i
wouldn't
think
the
lack
of
control
would
necessarily
ruin
perkin's
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
unless
you
view
it
as
a
line
commerce
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
perkins
was
competing
with
somebody?
justice
byron
r.
white
while
they
had
lower
prices
than
signal
as
in
fact
making
lower
or
less
than
competition
and
whatever
market
purposes
he's
competing,
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference
whether
perkins
and
signal
were
competing
or
not.
justice
byron
r.
white
could
you
just
briefly
tell
me
what
your
ultimate
theory
is
here
under
the
robinson-patman
act?
is
it
the
line
of
commerce
theory
or
is
it
the
injuring
or
preventing
competition
with
regal?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
but
what's
your
theory?
what's
your
theory
about
that?
how
did
you
prove
a
case
under
robinson-patman
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
discrimination
between
perkins
and
signal.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
what
is
the
--
what
is
the
line
of
commerce
that
is
injured?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
that's
the
whole
--
you
mean
on
all
levels?
justice
byron
r.
white
of
wholesale
or
--
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
the
line
of
commerce
is
the
retail
sale
of
gasoline?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
there
anything
in
the
record
about
the
characteristics
of
this
market,
the
geographic
market
and
the
product
market
and
what
advantage
perkins
has
in
it
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
in
the
record.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
have
the
burden
of
proof
in
that
case,
didn't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
it
that
the
legal
activity
essential
and
legal
evidence
essential
to
prove
damages
here
or
through
the
violation
or
both?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
saying
that
the
discrimination
between
perkins
and
signal
the
prices
in
which
its
impact
on
the
competition
in
adverse
impact
on
competition
at
the
level,
do
you
mean
perkins
and
signal
is
encompass
with
the
adversary?
justice
byron
r.
white
once
you
show
that
what
else
can
do
you
need
to
show?
you
have
shown
the
discrimination
and
adverse
affect
of
competition
that
the
perkins
and
signal
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
showed
injury
and
(inaudible).
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
this
is
a
--
do
you
think
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
did
it
not
get
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
we
agree
to
you
that
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
here?
that's
been
decided
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
that's
the
argument
of
causation?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
did
signal
sell
to
anybody
or
offered
to
sell
to
anybody
to
--
that
perkins
wanted
to
sell
too?
were
they
in
competition?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
weren't
the
perkins'
interests
--
weren't
the
perkins
--
what
were
the
perkins
interests,
wholesalers
and
what
do
you
call
them
distributors
or
jobbers
or
both?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
wasn't
signal
a
jobber?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
what
i
mean
it
had
a
jobbing
department
if
you
want
to
say
that.
i
mean
it
sold
in
wholesale?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
perkins
sold
a
wholesale?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
were
they
in
competition
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
weren't
speaking
any
--
they
weren't
selling
in
the
same
areas
or
they
weren't
selling
the
same
customer?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
perkins
wouldn't
have
thought
of
selling
one
of
signal's
customers
that
he
could've
gotten?
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
very
odd
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
with
western
but
how
about
generally?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
perkins
wouldn't
--
perkins
could've
gotten
some
of
signal's
customers
that
perkins
wouldn't
have
sold
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
think
it
ever
would
have
wanted
another
one
in
portland?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
you're
just
saying,
here
are
two
wholesalers
of
gasoline,
of
comparable
gasoline
selling
in
the
same
area
and
you're
saying
that
we
should
--
that
we
must
accept
the
fact
they
are
not
in
competition?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
the
court
of
appeals
in
by
deciding
at
the
way
it
did
at
least
implicitly
decide
that
there
was
no
control?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
said
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
it
doesn't
extend
to
fourth
line
situations,
the
act
of
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
wouldn't
have
been
a
fourth
line
situation
if
there'd
been
control?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
and
yet
it
reversed
so
it
just
said
that
--
if
you
said
that
there
--
that
unless
the
control
was
proved
the
act
didn't
reach
this?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
left
open
control
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
they
didn't
at
least
they
didn't
decide
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
without
proving
--
without
proving
control
they
decided
that
this
was
a
fourth
line
situation
covered
by
the
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
now
would
you
say
that
--
and
you
say
that
the
effect
on
the
line
of
commerce
in
which
perkins
was
engaged
is
not
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
he
felt
that
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
2
(a)
doesn't
exist
because
it's
fourth
line?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
petitioner
says,
well,
the
act
says
that
if
there's
an
adverse
effect
on
any
line
of
commerce.
now,
what
about
the
line
of
commerce
and
which
perkins
was
engaged?
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
submitted
in
the
district
court
to
the
jury
and
the
instructions
were
certainly
broad
enough
to
submit
this
issue
to
the
jury?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
it
focus
on
showing
a
lessening
of
competition
with
regal?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
the
verdict.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
regal
--
regal
cut
prices
and
therefore
competition
with
it
was
lessened?
justice
byron
r.
white
instructions
to
the
jury
didn't
focus
on
that
either?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
it
didn't
identify
--
it
didn't
say
--
it
didn't
ask
the
jury
to
focus
on
saying,
you
must
find
that
the
competition
was
regal
was
lessened?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
minority
holders
of
western
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
position,
the
minority
stockholders
of
western
were
also
i
suppose
rather
interested
in
having
accompanied
by
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
the
statute
when
it
says
lessening
competition
in
any
line
of
commerce;
do
you
think
that's
the
same
standard
as
saying
lessening
competition
with
a
customer?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
isn't
it,
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
you
could
have
any
line
of
commerce
could
apply
to
the
fourth
level?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
different
standard
than
just
preventing
or
lessening
competition
with
regal?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
before
you
could
show
a
lessening
competition
with
regal,
the
act
doesn't
cover
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean
that's
what
your
argument
is.
that's
what
the
court
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
you
could
show
lessening
of
competition
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
in
the
line
of
commerce
regal
was
engaged
in
the
act
would
reach
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
the
jury
followed
its
instructions
it
wouldn't
have
found
for
the
plaintiff
on
the
basis
that
competition
with
regal
had
been
lessened,
would
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why?
but
it
must
have
not
called
these
instructions
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
there
wasn't
anything
submitted
to
it
on
basis
of
control
and
if
it
followed
the
evidence
there
was
a
standard,
signal,
western,
regal?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
all
the
instructions
to
it
said
that
was
that
they
got
as
far
as
western
that
stopped
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
if
it
called
these
instructions
then
the
only
way
it
could've
reached
the
result
it
did
was
by
going
on
the
line
of
commerce?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you
think
that
the
jury
decided
to
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
of
the
companies
would
give
it
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
whether
there
was
control
or
not,
i
suppose
signal's
lower
price
was
either
passed
on
western,
and
if
it
wasn't
passed
on,
i
suppose
the
perkins
case
gets
much
covered,
doesn't
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
was
that
issue
put
to
the
jury?
didn't
that
have
to
if
the
jury
--
i
suppose
on
one
theory
of
the
case,
the
jury
would
have
had
to
have
found
that
it
was
passed
on.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
came
out
with
the
verdict
of
perkins.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
this
--
let
me
put
and
ask
something
else.
if
it
was
passed
on
a
regular
basis,
that
doesn't
really
make
much
difference
about
control,
does
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
it
wasn't
passed
on,
it
doesn't
make
any
make
difference
about
the
petroleum.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
how
come
does
regal
get
off
with
selling
at
such
a
low
price?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
it
buy
its
gas
at
a
low
price?
now,
how
does
that
operate?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
it
didn't
--
they
didn't
have
lower
prices?
justice
byron
r.
white
selling
prices.
justice
byron
r.
white
doesn't
the
record
show
what
regal
paying
for
gas?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you're
suggesting
now
that
it's
quite
rational
to
--
rational
in
terms
that
regal
although
selling
it
four
cents
below
what
the
price
was,
nevertheless,
was
paying
the
same
price
for
gas
that
other
people
were.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
just
still
wonder
if
control
is
very
relevant.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
standard's
price
cut
was
passed
on
right
on
through,
passed
right
on
through
at
all
levels,
i
wouldn't
think
the
lack
of
control
would
necessarily
ruin
perkin's
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
unless
you
view
it
as
a
line
commerce
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
perkins
was
competing
with
somebody?
justice
byron
r.
white
while
they
had
lower
prices
than
signal
as
in
fact
making
lower
or
less
than
competition
and
whatever
market
purposes
he's
competing,
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference
whether
perkins
and
signal
were
competing
or
not.
justice
byron
r.
white
could
you
just
briefly
tell
me
what
your
ultimate
theory
is
here
under
the
robinson-patman
act?
is
it
the
line
of
commerce
theory
or
is
it
the
injuring
or
preventing
competition
with
regal?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
but
what's
your
theory?
what's
your
theory
about
that?
how
did
you
prove
a
case
under
robinson-patman
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
discrimination
between
perkins
and
signal.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
what
is
the
--
what
is
the
line
of
commerce
that
is
injured?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
that's
the
whole
--
you
mean
on
all
levels?
justice
byron
r.
white
of
wholesale
or
--
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
the
line
of
commerce
is
the
retail
sale
of
gasoline?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
there
anything
in
the
record
about
the
characteristics
of
this
market,
the
geographic
market
and
the
product
market
and
what
advantage
perkins
has
in
it
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
in
the
record.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
have
the
burden
of
proof
in
that
case,
didn't
you?
