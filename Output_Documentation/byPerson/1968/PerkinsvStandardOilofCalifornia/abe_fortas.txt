justice

fortas
mr.
kintner,
suppose
regal,
western,
and
signal
had
all
been
totally
independent
of
standard,
no
control,
no
interlocking
directorates,
no
stock
ownership
up
the
line,
would
you
still
contend
that
2
(a)
applied?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at
as
i
understand
that
there
is
stock
ownership
all
the
way
down
the
chain
here
in
this
case
some
sort
of
stock
ownership,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
and
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at
is
whether
you
rely
on
the
facts
of
stock
ownership
running
from
standard
through
regal
and
western
--
standard,
signal,
western
and
regal
that
you
rely
on
it
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
on
that
stock
ownership
or
whether
you
say
that
even
without
stock
ownership
sales
by
standard
to
signal
at
a
lower
price
then
sales
by
standard
to
perkins
would
be
a
violation
of
2
(a)?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
let's
suppose
if
you
bear
with
me
another
few
minutes.
let's
suppose
that
signal
were
absolutely
independent
and
let's
suppose
that
standard
sold
to
signal
at
“x”
and
signal
is
fire
up
a
distribute
of
chain
wholesaler
or
whatever
its
proper
term
and
let's
suppose
that
standards
sold
to
perkins
retail
station
direct
at
“x”
plus10%
and
let's
suppose
that
signal
sold
to
its
retail
stations
non-affiliate
retail
stations
to
its
retail
customers
at
“x”
plus
5%,
am
i
clear?
are
you
clear
on
my
example?
justice
abe
fortas
would
you
say
that
that
was
a
violation
of
2
(a)
by
standard?
justice
abe
fortas
that's
what
i
urged
in
my
first
question
and
your
answer
mystified
me
a
little
that's
why
i
bothered
you
with
an
elaboration
of
it.
justice
abe
fortas
at
what
price
level
do
you
think
standard
should
have
sold
perkins
in
order
to
avoid
violation
of
2
(a),
the
same
price
that
sold
signal?
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
because
perkins
was
a
wholesaler?
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
the
reason
why
they
should've
been
in
your
theory
they
should've
sold
--
standard
should've
sold
perkins
at
the
same
price
as
signal?
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
you
mean
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
you
mean,
let's
suppose
perkins
was
not
a
wholesaler
at
all
but
perkins
had
one
gasoline
station
selling
at
retail,
does
your
in
its
purchase
directly
from
standard,
is
it
your
theory
of
2
(a)
that
standard
will
have
to
sell
to
perkins
retailed
gasoline
station
that
the
same
price
as
it
sold
to
signal
which
was
solely
a
wholesaler
and
distributor.
justice
abe
fortas
unless
its
cause
justified,
your
theory
is
that
there's
no
place
under
2
(a)
for
any
so-called
functional
price
differences.
justice
abe
fortas
how
much
of
perkins
purchases
from
standard
that
it
sell
to
anybody
other
than
itself?
justice
abe
fortas
the
record
show?
justice
abe
fortas
so
how
much
of
it
did
it
sell
to
anybody
else
than
its
own
gasoline
stations?
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
it
sold
to
nobody
except
to
its
own
gasoline
stations,
does
that
have
an
effect
on
your
theory
as
what
would
happen
under
2
(a)
on
your
theory?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
all
the
damages
that
are
involved
in
this
case
are
alleged
to
flow
from
injury
at
the
retail
level,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
understand
that
but
was
the
damage
allegedly
incurred
at
the
retail
level?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
then
i
suppose
your
theory
has
to
be
that
element
of
causation
here
that
causation
question
as
it
follows
that
the
damage
suffered
by
perkins'
retailed
gasoline
stations
was
caused
by
the
discriminatory
low
price
at
which
standard
sold
to
signal
which
enabled
to
signal
through
western
to
supply
regal
with
gasoline
at
the
price
which
enabled
regal
to
cut
below
perkins'
price
if
you
follow
me,
is
that
correct?
justice
abe
fortas
can
you
illustrate
the
difference
in
price
charged
to
signal
and
to
perkins,
about
how
much
was
it?
justice
abe
fortas
about
how
much
was
it?
justice
abe
fortas
in
the
price
charged
to
signal
and
on
the
one
hand
the
price
charged
to
perkins
on
the
other
hand?
justice
abe
fortas
you
mean
to
say
that
--
you're
saying
that
2
(a)
requires
for
the
delivered
price
even
if
the
gasoline
is
not
so
alone
in
delivered
basis
that
you
got
to
equalize
them
on
the
price,
net
price
to
the
allegedly
competing
buyers
on
a
delivered
basis.
justice
abe
fortas
price
paid
by
regal?
justice
abe
fortas
it
got
a
different
result
if
you
regarded
the
stock
ownership
of
regal
and
western
as
creating
a
sufficient
identification
with
signal
weren't
you?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
maybe
but
maybe
not
because
you
have
55%
of
the
stock
of
western
that
was
owned
by
signal,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
60%
and
then
how
much
of
the
stock
of
regal
was
owned
by
--
justice
abe
fortas
--western?
justice
abe
fortas
55%
so
you
had
a
chain
of
theoretical
control
anyway
all
the
way
down
from
signal
through
western
through
the
stations
and
you
therefore,
one
might
assume
what
kind
of
an
independence
of
pricing
judgment
but
then
one
might
not
depending
upon
one's
election
i
suppose.
justice
abe
fortas
some
people
think
that
no
situations
one
might
suspect
that,
what's
lost
on
the
peanuts
is
made
up
on
the
bananas;
sometimes
it
works
that
way
too.
justice
abe
fortas
because
of
the
55%
ownership
and
depending
upon
how
it
just
how
one
aggregate
sold
the
various
interest
are
entered
into
this
common
pool
if
you
want
to
regard
it
as
a
common
pool
of
ownership
and
financial
interest.
that's
--
that
to
me
is
going
to
sticky
problems
in
this
case
that's
why
i
was
asking
your
colleague
that
whether
they
had
make
a
difference
--
i
mean
your
adversaries
to
where
they
had
make
a
different
analysis
of
this
case
if
there
were
not
this
thread
of
more
that
majority
ownership
running
from
regal
to
western
to
signal.
and
here
you
do
have
that
thread
of
more
than
majority
ownership
that
runs
right
through
and
the
question
is
what
if
any
bearing
that
should
have
on
the
intricate
problems
presented
by
2
(a)
in
this
situation.
justice
abe
fortas
let
me
see
if
i
can
get
at
your
theory
which
is
what
i'm
trying
to
understand
in
a
very
simple
illustration.
let's
suppose
that
standard
sold
to
signal
which
resold
to
stations
--
independent
stations
and
let's
suppose
that
standard
sold
to
perkins
which
resold
independent
stations,
and
let
us
suppose
that
standard
sold
to
signal
at
a
lower
price
and
let
us
suppose
if
the
customers
of
signal
and
of
perkins
were
in
the
same
competitive
area,
violation
of
2
(a)
prima
facie.
justice
abe
fortas
right.
now,
the
question
is
whether
this
is
to
be
regarded
as
that
sort
of
a
case,
that's
one
of
the
questions
here
and
i
understand
what
you
say
about
control,
question
whether
it
is
controlled
or
which
we
should
look
or
the
majority
or
the
extent
of
stock
ownership
as
distinguished
from
operational
control?
i
think
that's
one
of
the
novel
questions
as
far
as
i
know
it's
a
novel
question
that
at
least
in
degree
that
this
case
presents.
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
signal
owned
the
100%
of
western
which
is
still
had
no
evidence
of
control
in
your
sense
say
the
issue
in
some
orders
to
management,
suppose
the
facts
or
otherwise
is
saying
and
suppose
western
owned
the
100%
of
regal
saying
with
the
factual
on
the
same,
would
you
still
think
that
this
case
truly
raises
the
question
of
--
that
we
would
have
to
decide
the
question
of
fourth
level
of
our
petition?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that's
where
a
petitioner
put
his
finger?
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
i
think
you
would,
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
usually
50%
is
considered
sort
of
a
dividing
line,
isn't
it?
for
me,
a
clear
dividing
line
sometimes
40%
or
less
than
that
may
also
be
significant
but
50%
usually
considered
pretty
significant.
justice
abe
fortas
in
many
event,
i
suggest
to
you
that
--
that's
why
i
was
asking
of
those
questions
of
mine
because
i
--
they
have
it
might
be,
i
don't
know
it
may
be
though
that
this
case
does
not
require
decision
about
the
fourth
level
of
the
distribution
channel
for
that
reason.
justice
abe
fortas
but
if
you
sell
gasoline,
low
cost
per
gallon,
the
more
gasoline
and
that's
all
you
sell,
the
more
gasoline
you
sell,
the
more
money
you
lose,
isn't
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
which
is
like
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
ribbons,
so
that
unless
in
a
costume,
the
more
ribbons
you
sell,
the
more
money
you
lose.
justice
abe
fortas
i
wanted
to
ask
you
(voice
overlap),
the
question
that
i
asked
you
yesterday
if
i
may,
but
i
didn't
ask
it
well.
i'll
try
it
again
today.
let
us
suppose
that
signal
owned
a
100%
of
western
and
western
owned
a
100%
of
regal
and
let
us
suppose
that
standard
sold
to
signal
at
a
lower
price
than
it
sold
the
same
product
to
perkins,
would
that
--
and
let's
assume
that
all
they
have
--
the
statutory
requirements
were
met
about
the
competition,
would
that
be
a
violation
of
2
(a)?
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
but
i
respect
the
logic
of
your
answer.
i
expect
you
probably
have
to
answer
it
that
way
consistently
with
your
position.
justice
abe
fortas
why
--
how
and
why
did
congress
cut
off
the
line
of
responsibility
in
that
way
on
the
grounds
that
it
would
not
be
fair
to
attribute
a
responsibility
to
the
original
supply
here
standing,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
can
you
think
of
any
other
reason,
i
can't.
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
justice
abe
fortas
--
one
of
the
question
you
have
here
is
whether
that
reasoning
of
the
congress
applies
to
a
case
where
there
is
majority
stock
ownership
down
the
line,
that
is
to
say
whether
in
that
kind
of
a
case
where
you
have
a
line
of
majority
stockholders
that
fall
all
the
way
through
such
as
you
have
here.
the
reasoning
of
congress
applies
that
is
to
say
that
it
would
not
be
fair
or
appropriate
to
obtain
responsibility
upon
the
original
seller
here
standing.
justice
abe
fortas
can
the
record
show
the
price
that
regal
paid?
justice
abe
fortas
why
is
that?
justice
abe
fortas
are
the
invoices
in
the
record?
justice
abe
fortas
i
see.
justice
abe
fortas
you
would
agree
wouldn't
you
that
the
fact
that
regal
sold
at
a
lower
price
than
perkins
does
not
establish
a
violation
of
law
standing
alone?
justice
abe
fortas
i
know.
as
i
understood
mr.
justice
white's
question
and
the
same
question
i
have
in
my
mind,
could
you
state
as
succinctly
just
what
the
theory
was
on
which
you
tried
this
case.
it
wouldn't
just
let
regal
sold
for
a
lower
price
than
perkins.
what
is
the
theory
on
which
this
case
was
tried?
i
was
a
little
startled
to
learn
that
the
invoices
showing
the
prices
paid
by
regal
are
not
in
this
record.
but
apart
from
that
parenthetical
remark,
would
you
say
--
tell
us
just
what
your
theory
was
and
is
on
this
case.
justice
abe
fortas
so
you
would
--
so
you
suggest
it
makes
no
difference
that
whether
signal,
western,
and
regal
were
or
were
not
connected
by
a
stock
ownership
makes
no
difference
at
what
level
the
signal
stations
were
in
terms
of
their
remoteness
from
standard.
justice
abe
fortas
what
do
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
you
mean
when
you
said
the
old
clayton
act?
justice
abe
fortas
what
part
of
the
law
are
you
talking
about?
justice
abe
fortas
section
2
(a)?
justice
abe
fortas
your
theory
cuts
back
far
behind,
far
underneath
years
and
years
of
gloss
on
section
2
(a)
then.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
kintner,
suppose
regal,
western,
and
signal
had
all
been
totally
independent
of
standard,
no
control,
no
interlocking
directorates,
no
stock
ownership
up
the
line,
would
you
still
contend
that
2
(a)
applied?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at
as
i
understand
that
there
is
stock
ownership
all
the
way
down
the
chain
here
in
this
case
some
sort
of
stock
ownership,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
and
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at
is
whether
you
rely
on
the
facts
of
stock
ownership
running
from
standard
through
regal
and
western
--
standard,
signal,
western
and
regal
that
you
rely
on
it
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
on
that
stock
ownership
or
whether
you
say
that
even
without
stock
ownership
sales
by
standard
to
signal
at
a
lower
price
then
sales
by
standard
to
perkins
would
be
a
violation
of
2
(a)?
justice

let's
suppose

with
me
another
few
minutes.
let's

i
understand
that
but
was
the
damage
allegedly
incurred
at
the
retail
level?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
then
i
suppose
your
theory
has
to
be
that
element
of
causation
here
that
causation
question
as
it
follows
that
the
damage
suffered
by
perkins'
retailed
gasoline
stations
was
caused
by
the
discriminatory
low
price
at
which
standard
sold
to
signal
which
enabled
to
signal
through
western
to
supply
regal
with
gasoline
at
the
price
which
enabled
regal
to
cut
below
perkins'
price
if
you
follow
me,
is
that
correct?
justice
abe
fortas
can
you
illustrate
the
difference
in
price
charged
to
signal
and
to
perkins,
about
how
much
was
it?
justice
abe
fortas
about
how
much
was
it?
justice
abe
fortas
in
the
price
charged
to
signal
and
on
the
one
hand
the
price
charged
to
perkins
on
the
other
hand?
justice
abe
fortas
you
mean
to
say
that
--
you're
saying
that
2
(a)
requires
for
the
delivered
price
even
if
the
gasoline
is
not
so
alone
in
delivered
basis
that
you
got
to
equalize
them
on
the
price,
net
price
to
the
allegedly
competing
buyers
on
a
delivered
basis.
justice
abe
fortas
price
paid
by
regal?
justice
abe
fortas
it
got
a
different
result
if
you
regarded
the
stock
ownership
of
regal
and
western
as
creating
a
sufficient
identification
with
signal
weren't
you?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
maybe
but
maybe
not
because
you
have
55%
of
the
stock
of
western
that
was
owned
by
signal,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
60%
and
then
how
much
of
the
stock
of
regal
was
owned
by
--
justice
abe
fortas
--western?
justice
abe
fortas
55%
so
you
had
a
chain
of
theoretical
control
anyway
all
the
way
down
from
signal
through
western
through
the
stations
and
you
therefore,
one
might
assume
what
kind
of
an
independence
of
pricing
judgment
but
then
one
might
not
depending
upon
one's
election
i
suppose.
justice
abe
fortas
some
people
think
that
no
situations
one
might
suspect
that,
what's
lost
on
the
peanuts
is
made
up
on
the
bananas;
sometimes
it
works
that
way
too.
justice
abe
fortas
because
of
the
55%
ownership
and
depending
upon
how
it
just
how
one
aggregate
sold
the
various
interest
are
entered
into
this
common
pool
if
you
want
to
regard
it
as
a
common
pool
of
ownership
and
financial
interest.
that's
--
that
to
me
is
going
to
sticky
problems
in
this
case
that's
why
i
was
asking
your
colleague
that
whether
they
had
make
a
difference
--
i
mean
your
adversaries
to
where
they
had
make
a
different
analysis
of
this
case
if
there
were
not
this
thread
of
more
that
majority
ownership
running
from
regal
to
western
to
signal.
and
here
you
do
have
that
thread
of
more
than
majority
ownership
that
runs
right
through
and
the
question
is
what
if
any
bearing
that
should
have
on
the
intricate
problems
presented
by
2
(a)
in
this
situation.
justice
abe
fortas
let
me
see
if
i
can
get
at
your
theory
which
is
what
i'm
trying
to
understand
in
a
very
simple
illustration.
let's
suppose
that
standard
sold
to
signal
which
resold
to
stations
--
independent
stations
and
let's
suppose
that
standard
sold
to
perkins
which
resold
independent
stations,
and
let
us
suppose
that
standard
sold
to
signal
at
a
lower
price
and
let
us
suppose
if
the
customers
of
signal
and
of
perkins
were
in
the
same
competitive
area,
violation
of
2
(a)
prima
facie.
justice
abe
fortas
right.
now,
the
question
is
whether
this
is
to
be
regarded
as
that
sort
of
a
case,
that's
one
of
the
questions
here
and
i
understand
what
you
say
about
control,
question
whether
it
is
controlled
or
which
we
should
look
or
the
majority
or
the
extent
of
stock
ownership
as
distinguished
from
operational
control?
i
think
that's
one
of
the
novel
questions
as
far
as
i
know
it's
a
novel
question
that
at
least
in
degree
that
this
case
presents.
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
signal
owned
the
100%
of
western
which
is
still
had
no
evidence
of
control
in
your
sense
say
the
issue
in
some
orders
to
management,
suppose
the
facts
or
otherwise
is
saying
and
suppose
western
owned
the
100%
of
regal
saying
with
the
factual
on
the
same,
would
you
still
think
that
this
case
truly
raises
the
question
of
--
that
we
would
have
to
decide
the
question
of
fourth
level
of
our
petition?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that's
where
a
petitioner
put
his
finger?
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
i
think
you
would,
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
usually
50%
is
considered
sort
of
a
dividing
line,
isn't
it?
for
me,
a
clear
dividing
line
sometimes
40%
or
less
than
that
may
also
be
significant
but
50%
usually
considered
pretty
significant.
justice
abe
fortas
in
many
event,
i
suggest
to
you
that
--
that's
why
i
was
asking
of
those
questions
of
mine
because
i
--
they
have
it
might
be,
i
don't
know
it
may
be
though
that
this
case
does
not
require
decision
about
the
fourth
level
of
the
distribution
channel
for
that
reason.
justice
abe
fortas
but
if
you
sell
gasoline,
low
cost
per
gallon,
the
more
gasoline
and
that's
all
you
sell,
the
more
gasoline
you
sell,
the
more
money
you
lose,
isn't
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
which
is
like
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
ribbons,
so
that
unless
in
a
costume,
the
more
ribbons
you
sell,
the
more
money
you
lose.
justice
abe
fortas
i
wanted
to
ask
you
(voice
overlap),
the
question
that
i
asked
you
yesterday
if
i
may,
but
i
didn't
ask
it
well.
i'll
try
it
again
today.
let
us
suppose
that
signal
owned
a
100%
of
western
and
western
owned
a
100%
of
regal
and
let
us
suppose
that
standard
sold
to
signal
at
a
lower
price
than
it
sold
the
same
product
to
perkins,
would
that
--
and
let's
assume
that
all
they
have
--
the
statutory
requirements
were
met
about
the
competition,
would
that
be
a
violation
of
2
(a)?
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
but
i
respect
the
logic
of
your
answer.
i
expect
you
probably
have
to
answer
it
that
way
consistently
with
your
position.
justice
abe
fortas
why
--
how
and
why
did
congress
cut
off
the
line
of
responsibility
in
that
way
on
the
grounds
that
it
would
not
be
fair
to
attribute
a
responsibility
to
the
original
supply
here
standing,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
can
you
think
of
any
other
reason,
i
can't.
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
justice
abe
fortas
--
one
of
the
question
you
have
here
is
whether
that
reasoning
of
the
congress
applies
to
a
case
where
there
is
majority
stock
ownership
down
the
line,
that
is
to
say
whether
in
that
kind
of
a
case
where
you
have
a
line
of
majority
stockholders
that
fall
all
the
way
through
such
as
you
have
here.
the
reasoning
of
congress
applies
that
is
to
say
that
it
would
not
be
fair
or
appropriate
to
obtain
responsibility
upon
the
original
seller
here
standing.
justice
abe
fortas
can
the
record
show
the
price
that
regal
paid?
justice
abe
fortas
why
is
that?
justice
abe
fortas
are
the
invoices
in
the
record?
justice
abe
fortas
i
see.
justice
abe
fortas
you
would
agree
wouldn't
you
that
the
fact
that
regal
sold
at
a
lower
price
than
perkins
does
not
establish
a
violation
of
law
standing
alone?
justice
abe
fortas
i
know.
as
i
understood
mr.
justice
white's
question
and
the
same
question
i
have
in
my
mind,
could
you
state
as
succinctly
just
what
the
theory
was
on
which
you
tried
this
case.
it
wouldn't
just
let
regal
sold
for
a
lower
price
than
perkins.
what
is
the
theory
on
which
this
case
was
tried?
i
was
a
little
startled
to
learn
that
the
invoices
showing
the
prices
paid
by
regal
are
not
in
this
record.
but
apart
from
that
parenthetical
remark,
would
you
say
--
tell
us
just
what
your
theory
was
and
is
on
this
case.
justice
abe
fortas
so
you
would
--
so
you
suggest
it
makes
no
difference
that
whether
signal,
western,
and
regal
were
or
were
not
connected
by
a
stock
ownership
makes
no
difference
at
what
level
the
signal
stations
were
in
terms
of
their
remoteness
from
standard.
justice
abe
fortas
what
do
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
you
mean
when
you
said
the
old
clayton
act?
justice
abe
fortas
what
part
of
the
law
are
you
talking
about?
justice
abe
fortas
section
2
(a)?
justice
abe
fortas
your
theory
cuts
back
far
behind,
far
underneath
years
and
years
of
gloss
on
section
2
(a)
then.
