mr.
earl
w.
kintner
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
permit
me
to
premise
my
remarks
by
stating
that
i
will
focus
primarily
upon
the
principle
clayton
act
questions
presented
in
this
appeal.
and
mr.
kucik,
my
colleague
will
examine
both
the
questions
of
causation
and
damages.
this
case
has
come
to
the
court
on
a
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
filed
on
october
9,
1968
and
granted
by
this
court
on
january
13,
1969.
the
petitioner,
clyde
a.
perkins
filed
this
suit
against
the
respondent,
standard
oil
company
of
california
in
march
of
1959,
10
years
ago
alleging
violations
of
sections
2
(d),
2
(a),
(d)
and
(e)
of
the
clayton
act
as
amended
by
the
robinson-patman
act
of
1936.
in
december
of
1963,
the
jury
awarded
the
petitioner
actual
damages
of
$336,407.57
which
was
trebled
and
attorney's
fees
of
$289,000.00.
the
case
was
--
the
cause
was
argued
before
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
in
june
of
1965
and
then
in
november
of
1967
early
two
and
a
half
years
later
after
oral
argument
and
four
years
after
the
jury
have
reached
its
verdict,
the
ninth
circuit
set
aside
the
jury
verdict
and
ordered
a
new
trial
approximately
eight
months
later
in
july
16,
1968
court
of
appeals
denied
the
appellee's
petition
for
rehearing.
now,
before
proceeding
to
a
discussion
of
the
ninth
circuit's
clayton
act
holding,
i
would
like
briefly
to
identify
the
persons
involved
and
state
the
facts
which
i
think
are
essential
to
an
understanding
of
this
portion
of
the
ninth
circuit's
decision.
petitioner
perkins
was
one
of
the
largest
independent
distributors
in
the
pacific
northwest
states
of
oregon
and
washington.
he
began
business
in
1928
with
a
single
filling
station
and
over
the
years
built
a
wholesale
and
retail
gasoline
of
business
and
during
the
claim
period
march
2
to
december
2,
19
--
march
2,
1955
to
december
2,
1957.
he
lease
to
operated
approximately
60
retail
stations.
perkins
was
a
wholesaler
operating
trucking
equipment
and
bulk
storage
plants.
he
purchased
substantially
all
his
requirements
from
standard
oil
of
california.
there
is
some
indication
that
he
purchased
a
little
else
where
but
the
record
shows
that
this
was
at
the
instance
of
standard
to
test
the
market,
the
price.
he
was
required
to
maintain
a
bulk
storage
plant
and
an
inventory
on
which
he
paid
taxes.
he
could
not
represent
the
sole
major
brand
gasoline.
now,
standard
is
engaged
in
all
aspects
of
the
oil
industry
from
drilling
for
crude
oil
to
selling
gasoline
of
retail
and
during
the
claim
period,
he
had
nearly
30%
of
the
gasoline
market
in
the
pacific
northwest.
it
was
the
price
leader
in
the
pacific
northwest,
selling
its
gasoline
through
its
own
branded
dealers,
the
chevron
and
signal
brands
and
the
wholesalers
like
perkins
and
signal
oil
and
gas.
signal
oil
and
gas
purchased
during
the
claim
period
its
requirements
from
standard
oil.
now,
signal
oil
and
gas
is
a
large
integrated
company
engaged
both
in
the
production
of
crude
oil
and
the
distribution
of
gasoline
in
the
western
united
states.
signal
has
been
both
a
supplier
and
a
customer
of
standard
since
the
early
30's.
it
drew,
it
supplies
directly
from
standard
storage
facilities
in
near
portland
and
in
seattle
during
the
claim
period
and
it
purchased
during
that
period
only
from
standard
in
that
area.
it
reinvoice
its
purchases
from
standard,
had
no
storage
facilities,
had
drove
from
the
standard
bulk
facilities,
it
was
in
competition
with
perkins.
it
reinvoice
to
western
hyway
oil
company
which
was
incorporated
in
1950
with
signal
owning
60%
of
its
stock.
western
hyway
functions
as
signal's
transportation
arm
in
oregon
picking
up
gasoline
from
standard's
willbridge
terminal
in
portland
and
delivering
it
to
retail
stations
in
portland
operated
by
the
regal
stations
company.
now,
these
stations
there
were
three
were
no
more
than
150
blocks
from
the
bulk
plant
and
western
hyway's
function
was
to
take
its
trucks
and
transport
to
gasoline
to
those
stations
from
the
standard
bulk
plant.
regal
was
formed
in
1956
when
with
western
hyway
owning
55%
of
the
stock
and
in
1957,
western
hyway,
the
signal
oil
and
gas
subsidiary
acquired
100%
of
the
stock
of
regal.
it
operated
three
stations
in
the
portland
area
which
competed
with
stations
owned
by
perkins.
now,
these
stations
were
set
up
near
the
third
quarter
of
1956
at
the
time
when
--
through
to
1957
and
early
1957
these
three
regal
stations
in
the
portland
area.
at
the
time
when
signal
oil
and
gas
or
when
regal
was
--
when
signal
oil
and
gas
which
was
--
of
which
regal
was
part
of
the
family
was
carrying
on
its
books,
a
rebate,
an
anticipated
rebate
which
was
later
paid.
in
fact,
the
rebate
was
paid
in
january
of
1957
by
standard
to
signal.
signal
already
and
anticipated
that
and
had
it
on
its
books
and
had
been
negotiations
since
spring
for
this
rebate.
now,
these
stations
were
set
up
in
that
time
context
these
three
regal
stations
in
portland
and
they
immediately
started
a
price
war.
the
court
of
appeals
set
aside
the
entire
jury
verdict
in
favor
of
perkins
because
some
of
the
petitioners
proved
on
the
two-way
aspects
of
his
claims,
the
section
2
(a)
of
the
amended
clayton
act
demonstrated
that
signal,
the
wholesaler
obtaining
the
better
price
resold
the
gasoline
to
western
hyway
who
in
turn
resold
to
yet
another
subsidiary
regal.
the
ninth
circuit
rule
as
a
matter
of
law
that
section
2
(a)
of
the
robinson-patman
act
“does
not
recognized
a
casual
connection
essential
to
liability
between
a
supplier's
price
discrimination
and
the
trade
practices
of
a
customer
is
far
removed
on
the
distributive
letter
as
regal
was
from
standard.”
in
other
words,
the
court
of
appeals
says,
--
said
that
section
2
(a)
was
limited
and
terms
to
three
levels
of
cognizable
competitive
injury
and
that
the
injury
to
perkins
occasioned
by
regal's
marketing
activities
did
not
come
within
the
purview
of
those
three
levels
limitations.
since,
a
large
part
of
perkins'
damage
was
attributable
to
the
activities
of
regal
which
operated
at
the
fourth
level
distribution.
the
entire
verdict
was
been
deemed
tainted
and
set
aside.
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
court
of
appeals
aired
in
so
holding.
first,
the
jury
properly
could
have
returned
the
verdict
against
standard
on
the
ground
that
the
effect
of
its
price
discrimination
the
favor
of
signal
may
have
been
substantially
to
lessen
competition
in
the
pacific
northwest
wholesale
and
retail
gasoline
market.
section
2
(a)
of
the
amended
clayton
act
contains
two
independent
test
of
illegality.
it
prohibits
price
discrimination
where
the
effect
may
be
substantially
to
lessen
competition
or
to
tend,
to
monopoly
in
any
line
of
commerce.
and
then
it
has
another
test
to
injure,
destroy,
or
prevent
competition
with
any
person
who
either
grants
knowingly
receives
the
benefit
of
such
discrimination,
or
with
the
customers
of
either
one
of
the
then.
the
ninth
circuit
completely
ignored
the
substantiality
to
lessen
competition
standard,
a
carry
over
from
the
original
clayton
act
section
2
and
setting
aside
this
jury's
verdict.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
yes,
your
honor.
the
--
this
was
before
the
ninth
circuit,
it
was
before
the
jury,
both
standard
and
perkins
offered
charges
to
the
jury
and
the
judge
i
think
substantially
and
properly
charged
the
jury
so
that
this
question
of
over
all
injury
to
competition
and
tendency
toward
monopoly
was
proper
before
the
jury.
now,
i
would
say
that
that
in
retrospect,
both
perkins
and
standard
could've
been
far
more
explicit
and
extensive
in
submitting
proposed
charges
to
the
jury
and
the
judge
perhaps
could've
been
more
explicit
and
could've
charged
more
extensively.
but
the
fact
was
that
the
whole
question
of
injury
to
competition
and
a
tendency
toward
monopoly
was
before
the
jury
and
the
jury
even
though
not
as
elegantly
charged
as
one
--
as
some
might
wish
that
it
were
charged
was
substantially
charged
and
knew
what
the
raise
just
i
was,
knew
what
the
questions
of
fact
were,
knew
what
they
had
to
decide.
the
court
of
appeals
exalted
form
at
the
expense
of
economic
reality
by
imposing
an
artificial
three-level
limitation
on
section
2
(a)
to
prevent
discriminations
which
tends
substantially
lessen
competition
in
any
line
of
commerce.
it
failed
to
assign
any
way,
the
ninth
circuit
failed
to
assign
any
way,
the
fact
that
standard's
price
discrimination
has
caused
a
substantial
lessening
of
competition
in
the
pacific
northwest
wholesale
and
gasoline
markets
driving
out
of
business
one
of
the
areas
largest
independents.
moreover,
by
basing
that
limitation
exclusively
on
the
number
of
persons
in
the
distributive
chain
established
by
the
favored
purchaser,
that
decision,
if
the
court
please,
unless
reversed
will
enable
large
buyers
virtually
to
insure
statutory
immunity
to
suppliers
which
grant
them
favorable
price
concessions.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
i
think
we
have
a
different
factual
situation
but
the
realities
and
petroleum
marketing
are
such
that
it
is
the
price
of
the
retailer.
the
competition
exist
at
that
retail
level
and
if
any
one
went
up
that
change
gets
a
better
price
and
is
able
to
pass
along
at
the
retail
level
that
you
can
have
absolute
chaos
at
the
retail
level.
and
this
is
a
business
--
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
yes.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
we
don't
have
it
--
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
well,
we
have
alternative
theories
on
this
of
course
depending
on
how
you
read
the
evidence
but
the
--
we
believe
and
i
urge
upon
the
court
that
these
were
two
families
of
gasoline
dealers
and
that
through
the
economic
realities
that
the
retailers
are
tied
to
particular
suppliers,
the
gasoline
business
and
that
it
wouldn't
matter
if
there
was
a
lack
of
ownership
here
and
family
connection
if
the
discrimination
were
passed
from
signal
down
to
regal
stations
and
perkins
who
had
his
own
chain
of
stations
was
unable
to
compete.
the
damage
occurred
at
the
retail
level
because
perkins
either
had
to
take
a
loss
or
he
had
to
see
his
stations
compete
on
an
unequal
basis.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
i
think
you
have
to
go
back
mr.
justice
to
the
relationship
of
the
parties
with
the
supplier
if
the
parties
were
both
independent
as
signal
supplier
--
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
signal
and
perkins
--
signal
oil
and
gas
and
perkins
are
both
independent
of
standard
oil.
perkins
was
required
to
purchase
his
oil
from
standard
oil
and
signal
did
purchase
all
of
its
oil
from
a
gasoline
from
standard
oil
but
they
were
both
independent
of
standard
oil,
they
were
independent
dealers
and
wholesalers
and
if
the
perkins
company
is
unfairly
discriminated
against.
it
is
unable
to
pass
down
to
its
chain
of
distribution
the
equivalent
benefits
that
can
be
passed
through
by
signal
and
the
proof
of
the
putting
is
in
the
eating
at
the
retailer
level.
now,
i
think
it
makes
a
harder
case
if
there's
a
family
relationship
as
there
is
here
and
you
got
alternatives
which
one
didn't
have
in
the
hamm
brewing
case
where
and
duluth
and
superior,
the
distributor
--
two
distributors
of
the
hamm
company
were
unable
to
compete
across
the
state
lines
although
this
was
one
market.
but
the
superior
distributor
was
given
a
better
price
and
his
retailers
then
were
able
to
take
advantage
of
the
retailers
on
the
other
side
of
the
state
line
and
the
same
market
take
the
customers
away
simply
because
the
better
price
was
passed
on
the
line
at
the
retail
level.
as
we
read
it,
section
2
(a)
prohibits
all
price
discriminations
the
effect
of
which
may
be
substantially
to
lessen
competition
in
a
commercially
significant
product
and
geographic
market.
regardless
of
the
functional
level,
this
is
our
theory
of
the
case,
it
was
before
the
jury
and
all
of
the
economic
setting
and
the
charges
given
by
the
judge
and
it
is
in
this
instance
that
we
feel
that
basically
the
ninth
circuit
was
wrong.
and
george
van

a
1928
case
prior
to
the
passage
of
the
robinson-patman
act
in
19
--
amendment
in
1936
decided
--
and
decided
prior
to
that
amendment.
the
court
rejected
the
defendant's
argument
that
its
price
discriminations
could
not
be
challenged
by
a
purchaser
because
the
words
in
any
line
of
commerce
must
be
confined
to
the
line
of
commerce
in
which
the
distributor
is
engaged.
in
other
words,
confined
to
what
is
called
primary
line
injury.
the
court
ruled
if
the
words
in
any
line
of
commerce
literally
were
satisfied
if
a
forbidden
fact
is
produced
in
one
of
the
buries
in
one
out
of
all
the
various
lines
of
commerce.
the
point
in
the
favored
purchaser's
chain
of
distribution
of
which
injury
to
competition
is
first
felt
is
a
concern
only
with
respect
to
the
factual
question
of
causation
not
with
respect
to
whether
the
statute
has
been
violated
as
a
matter
of
law.
and
we
feel
that
this
court
should
bring
its
section
2
of
the
clayton
act
in
harmony
with
its
interpretations
in
the
van
camp
decision
prior
to
the
passage
of
robinson-patman
act
and
in
harmony
with
its
uniform
interpretations
of
similar
language
of
the
same
language
in
section
3
and
7
of
the
clayton
act.
standard
was
a
price
leader
and
the
principle
supplier
of
gasoline
in
pacific
northwest
and
perkins
was
bound
to
purchase
the
vast
bulk
if
not
all
of
his
gasoline
from
standard.
it
was
a
market
dominated
by
the
majors
where
the
independents
had
been
declining.
in
fact,
perkins
was
marketing
8%
of
standard's
gasoline
and
one-third
of
that
market
to
which
he
was
confined
and
during
the
claim
period
he
lost
13%
of
his
gallonage,
he
lost
50%
of
his
fuel
oil
business
which
is
tied
to
gasoline
as
the
record
shows,
and
signal,
the
distributor,
the
independent
distributor
from
standard
in
whose
favor
the
discrimination
was
granted,
gained
50%
during
that
claim
period
in
gallonage.
and
as
perkins'
expert
witness,
dr.
mann
testified
in
response
to
a
hypothetical
question
covering
the
same
record
evidence,
the
foreseeable
market
trend
in
that
area
was
toward
increase
concentration
a
decline
of
small
business
and
a
higher
gasoline
prices
and
he
said
this
significant
to
leave
which
i
doubly
believe
that
in
other
words
price
discrimination
and
monopoly
are
siamese
twins.
and
perkins
during
this
period
for
he
went
out
of
business
constantly
begged
standard
for
price
assistance.
it
was
only
one
month
before
signal's
present
one
on
the
stand
they've
been
denying
they
were
giving
price
assistance
that
they
finally
admitted
a
discrimination
of
$1
million.
and
perkins
finally
got
some
price
assistance,
it
was
a
small
amount
and
it
amounted
for
all
of
his
60
stations
to
what
standard
gave
one
of
its
branded
stations
in
a
75-day
period.
signal
was
even
able
during
the
claim
period
to
offer,
to
sell
to
perkins
gasoline
at
three-fourths
of
a
gallon
or
on
regular
and
eight-tenths
on
ethyl.
although,
standard
when
faced
with
this
denied
that
it
was
discriminating
in
favor
of
signal.
we
submit
on
a
basis
of
the
forgoing
that
the
jury
could
have
found
not
only
that
a
substantial
lessening
of
competition
was
threatened
but
that
as
a
substantial
diminution
in
the
vigor
of
competition
had
already
in
fact
occurred.
and
thus,
the
jury's
verdict
was
affordable
on
this
basis.
we
do
not
believe
that
it
was
the
intention
of
the
congress
in
changing
only
a
split
infinity
in
correcting
only
a
split
infinity
when
it
pass
the
robinson-patman
amendment
that
it
was
the
intent
of
congress
to
weaken
the
robinson-patman
amendment.
this
court
itself
has
said
quite
positively
to
the
contrary
in
the
anheuser-busch
decision.
the
legislative
history
and
i
quote
the
opinion
of
this
court,
“the
legislative
history
of
these
amendments
leaves
no
doubt
that
the
congress
was
intent
upon
strengthening
the
clayton
act
provisions
not
weakening
them.”
the
congress
did
not
intend
that
that
language
of
regarding
competition
injury
to
competition
and
a
tendency
toward
monopoly
should
become
mere
surplusage
with
respect
to
the
amended
clayton
act.
it
conferred
upon
small
business
a
less
stringent
remedy
when
it
pass
that
robinson-patman
amendment
but
it
left
the
more
stringent
remedy
to
those
like
perkins
who
are
amply
able
with
an
ample
record
to
prove
the
violation
of
the
original
standards
of
the
clayton
act
section
2.
thank
you,
your
honors.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
it
was
the
auditor
--
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
it
was
the
auditor
who
was
put
on
the
stand
by
standard
and
mr.
maclaury
examined
him
and
did
not
ask
any
question
with
respect
to
the
price.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
mr.
maclaury
said
yesterday
in
his
argument
that
the
minority
ownership
and
western
hyway
lay
with
the
officers
of
western
hyway.
i
quote
you
from
the
printed
record
a
question
to
the
same
auditor
by
mr.
maclaury
with
respect
to
the
years
1955,
1956,
1957.
what
entities
or
what
persons
own
the
stock,
a
capital
stock
of
western
hyway
oil
company?
answer:
in
western
hyway
oil
company,
60%
of
the
shares
were
owned
by
signal
oil
and
gas
company
and
40%
was
owned
by
three
individuals
who
were
corporate
officers
but
he
didn't
ask
corporate
officers
of
signal
or
corporate
officers
of
western
hyway.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
i
think
sir
that
that
there
two
--
there
are
at
least
two
possible
alternatives
here
for
this
court.
i
believe
beyond
question
that
the
ninth
circuit
was
wrong
with
respect
to
the
old
clayton
act.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
i
think
that
the
case
can
be
proved
under
old
clayton
act
by
showing
a
discrimination.
mr.
maclaury
has
indicated
the
jury
--
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
perkins
and
signal,
there
was
a
--
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
the
line
of
commerce
is
a
whole
northwest,
the
petroleum
marketing
as
our
expert
witness
indicated.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
yes,
sir.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
the
competition
is
down
at
the
retail
level.
this
is
where
the
injury
is
felt.
this
is
where
the
price
war
started.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
yes
your
honor
and
in
this
instance,
retail
and
the
wholesale
because
perkins
had
a
average
profit
of
1.54%
and
standard
itself
indicated
that
it
took
two
cents
to
live.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
the
perkins
had
2.4%
of
the
overall
market.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
that
is
in
the
record.
that's
the
equivalent
of
what
sun
oil
has
nationally.
perkins
sold
8%
of
standard's
gallonage
in
that
market.
standard
had
30%
of
that
market.
perkins
lost
13%
of
its
gallonage
of
gasoline,
50%
of
its
gallonage
of
fuel
oil
during
the
claim
period
and
signal
gained
50%
during
the
claim
period.
perkins
was
making
an
average
of
1.54
cents
a
gallon,
standard's
own
witnesses
stated
that
it
took
2
cents
a
gallon
to
live
and
if
you
added
the
discrimination
which
standard
gave
to
signal
to
perkins'
price,
perkins
would
have
had
2.2
cents
per
gallon
which
would
have
given
him
a
fighting
chance
of
living
in
that
market.
now,
there's
no
evidence
as
to
the
price
that
regal
sold
in
that
market.
standard's
own
executive
acknowledged
that
regal
had
a
better
price
than
perkins
and
that
regal
would
wreck
that
market
unless
something
was
done
to
control
them.
there's
no
evidence
of
western's
price
of
course
to
regal.
standard
was
in
a
position
to
supply
this
but
didn't
do
it.
and
in
that
connection,
this
court
has
held
with
respect
to
the
matter
of
--
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
yes,
your
honor
and
if
i
might
return
to
this
question
of
control,
i
think
that
we
adduced
a
sufficient
evidence
from
which
the
jury
could
have
inferred
that
there
was
control
with
respect
to
regal
and
western
by
signal.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
the
amount
of
ownership
and
--
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
there
is
other
evidence
that
standard
treated
an
offer
made
to
western
hyway
for
the
purchase
of
gasoline
as
an
offer
made
to
signal,
its
customer.
that
is
in
the
record.
and
we
think
that
looking
at
the
whole
evidence,
the
whole
record,
the
jury
could
reasonably
have
inferred
that
there
was
control.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
not
standing
alone
sir.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
the
theory
was
that
standard
gave
a
better
price
to
signal
which
resulted
as
it
was
passed
down
the
line
in
a
price
war
which
spread
from
portland
as
one
would
drop
a
pebble
into
a
pool
of
water
throughout
the
northwest
territory,
in
northwest
market.
also
there
is
considerable
proof
that
that
standard
because
of
this
price
war
gave
special
assistance
to
its
retail
stations
which
were
branded
stations
which
were
competing
with
the
perkins
stations
just
as
perkins
stations
were
competing
with
the
regal
stations.
so
that
what
you
have
here
as
dr.
munn
pointed
out
in
his
testimony
is
an
examination
of
the
whole
petroleum
marketing
situation
in
the
northwest
and
based
upon
his
hypotheticals,
he
found
that
there
was
a
lessening
of
competition,
a
tendency
to
work
monopoly,
and
a
probability
of
higher
prices.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
i
think
sir
that
under
the
old
clayton
act,
it
makes
no
difference
with
respect
to
a
showing
of
injury
not
based
upon
functions.
but
--
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
--
alternatively
--
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
this
is
the
first
alternative
spelled
out
in
the
amended
clayton
act
which
is
a
carryover
of
the
language,
the
same
language
used
in
sections
3
and
7
which
this
court
has
interpreted
many
times.
i
say
under
that
--
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
i'm
talking
about
the
amended,
the
robinson-patman.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
section
2
(a),
amendments
to
the
clayton
act
which
carried
over
in
the
amendments.
the
first
alternative
injured
the
competition
and
tendency
toward
monopoly
and
added
the
functional
amendment
to
the
clayton
act
under
which
i
also
think
we
have
adequate
evidence
here
in
this
record
from
which
the
jury
could
have
found
that
the
requisite
injury.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
section
2
(a)
has
been
glossed
at
the
functional
level
many
times.
i
think
it's
time
this
court
ruled
on
the
first
alternative
and
made
that
first
alternative
applicable
as
it
has
made
the
summarily
language
at
or
under
sections
3
and
7.
thank
you.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
permit
me
to
premise
my
remarks
by
stating
that
i
will
focus
primarily
upon
the
principle
clayton
act
questions
presented
in
this
appeal.
and
mr.
kucik,
my
colleague
will
examine
both
the
questions
of
causation
and
damages.
this
case
has
come
to
the
court
on
a
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
filed
on
october
9,
1968
and
granted
by
this
court
on
january
13,
1969.
the
petitioner,
clyde
a.
perkins
filed
this
suit
against
the
respondent,
standard
oil
company
of
california
in
march
of
1959,
10
years
ago
alleging
violations
of
sections
2
(d),
2
(a),
(d)
and
(e)
of
the
clayton
act
as
amended
by
the
robinson-patman
act
of
1936.
in
december
of
1963,
the
jury
awarded
the
petitioner
actual
damages
of
$336,407.57
which
was
trebled
and
attorney's
fees
of
$289,000.00.
the
case
was
--
the
cause
was
argued
before
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
in
june
of
1965
and
then
in
november
of
1967
early
two
and
a
half
years
later
after
oral
argument
and
four
years
after
the
jury
have
reached
its
verdict,
the
ninth
circuit
set
aside
the
jury
verdict
and
ordered
a
new
trial
approximately
eight
months
later
in
july
16,
1968
court
of
appeals
denied
the
appellee's
petition
for
rehearing.
now,
before
proceeding
to
a
discussion
of
the
ninth
circuit's
clayton
act
holding,
i
would
like
briefly
to
identify
the
persons
involved
and
state
the
facts
which
i
think
are
essential
to
an
understanding
of
this
portion
of
the
ninth
circuit's
decision.
petitioner
perkins
was
one
of
the
largest
independent
distributors
in
the
pacific
northwest
states
of
oregon
and
washington.
he
began
business
in
1928
with
a
single
filling
station
and
over
the
years
built
a
wholesale
and
retail
gasoline
of
business
and
during
the
claim
period
march
2
to
december
2,
19
--
march
2,
1955
to
december
2,
1957.
he
lease
to
operated
approximately
60
retail
stations.
perkins
was
a
wholesaler
operating
trucking
equipment
and
bulk
storage
plants.
he
purchased
substantially
all
his
requirements
from
standard
oil
of
california.
there
is
some
indication
that
he
purchased
a
little
else
where
but
the
record
shows
that
this
was
at
the
instance
of
standard
to
test
the
market,
the
price.
he
was
required
to
maintain
a
bulk
storage
plant
and
an
inventory
on
which
he
paid
taxes.
he
could
not
represent
the
sole
major
brand
gasoline.
now,
standard
is
engaged
in
all
aspects
of
the
oil
industry
from
drilling
for
crude
oil
to
selling
gasoline
of
retail
and
during
the
claim
period,
he
had
nearly
30%
of
the
gasoline
market
in
the
pacific
northwest.
it
was
the
price
leader
in
the
pacific
northwest,
selling
its
gasoline
through
its
own
branded
dealers,
the
chevron
and
signal
brands
and
the
wholesalers
like
perkins
and
signal
oil
and
gas.
signal
oil
and
gas
purchased
during
the
claim
period
its
requirements
from
standard
oil.
now,
signal
oil
and
gas
is
a
large
integrated
company
engaged
both
in
the
production
of
crude
oil
and
the
distribution
of
gasoline
in
the
western
united
states.
signal
has
been
both
a
supplier
and
a
customer
of
standard
since
the
early
30's.
it
drew,
it
supplies
directly
from
standard
storage
facilities
in
near
portland
and
in
seattle
during
the
claim
period
and
it
purchased
during
that
period
only
from
standard
in
that
area.
it
reinvoice
its
purchases
from
standard,
had
no
storage
facilities,
had
drove
from
the
standard
bulk
facilities,
it
was
in
competition
with
perkins.
it
reinvoice
to
western
hyway
oil
company
which
was
incorporated
in
1950
with
signal
owning
60%
of
its
stock.
western
hyway
functions
as
signal's
transportation
arm
in
oregon
picking
up
gasoline
from
standard's
willbridge
terminal
in
portland
and
delivering
it
to
retail
stations
in
portland
operated
by
the
regal
stations
company.
now,
these
stations
there
were
three
were
no
more
than
150
blocks
from
the
bulk
plant
and
western
hyway's
function
was
to
take
its
trucks
and
transport
to
gasoline
to
those
stations
from
the
standard
bulk
plant.
regal
was
formed
in
1956
when
with
western
hyway
owning
55%
of
the
stock
and
in
1957,
western
hyway,
the
signal
oil
and
gas
subsidiary
acquired
100%
of
the
stock
of
regal.
it
operated
three
stations
in
the
portland
area
which
competed
with
stations
owned
by
perkins.
now,
these
stations
were
set
up
near
the
third
quarter
of
1956
at
the
time
when
--
through
to
1957
and
early
1957
these
three
regal
stations
in
the
portland
area.
at
the
time
when
signal
oil
and
gas
or
when
regal
was
--
when
signal
oil
and
gas
which
was
--
of
which
regal
was
part
of
the
family
was
carrying
on
its
books,
a
rebate,
an
anticipated
rebate
which
was
later
paid.
in
fact,
the
rebate
was
paid
in
january
of
1957
by
standard
to
signal.
signal
already
and
anticipated
that
and
had
it
on
its
books
and
had
been
negotiations
since
spring
for
this
rebate.
now,
these
stations
were
set
up
in
that
time
context
these
three
regal
stations
in
portland
and
they
immediately
started
a
price
war.
the
court
of
appeals
set
aside
the
entire
jury
verdict
in
favor
of
perkins
because
some
of
the
petitioners
proved
on
the
two-way
aspects
of
his
claims,
the
section
2
(a)
of
the
amended
clayton
act
demonstrated
that
signal,
the
wholesaler
obtaining
the
better
price
resold
the
gasoline
to
western
hyway
who
in
turn
resold
to
yet
another
subsidiary
regal.
the
ninth
circuit
rule
as
a
matter
of
law
that
section
2
(a)
of
the
robinson-patman
act
“does
not
recognized
a
casual
connection
essential
to
liability
between
a
supplier's
price
discrimination
and
the
trade
practices
of
a
customer
is
far
removed
on
the
distributive
letter
as
regal
was
from
standard.”
in
other
words,
the
court
of
appeals
says,
--
said
that
section
2
(a)
was
limited
and
terms
to
three
levels
of
cognizable
competitive
injury
and
that
the
injury
to
perkins
occasioned
by
regal's
marketing
activities
did
not
come
within
the
purview
of
those
three
levels
limitations.
since,
a
large
part
of
perkins'
damage
was
attributable
to
the
activities
of
regal
which
operated
at
the
fourth
level
distribution.
the
entire
verdict
was
been
deemed
tainted
and
set
aside.
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
court
of
appeals
aired
in
so
holding.
first,
the
jury
properly
could
have
returned
the
verdict
against
standard
on
the
ground
that
the
effect
of
its
price
discrimination
the
favor
of
signal
may
have
been
substantially
to
lessen
competition
in
the
pacific
northwest
wholesale
and
retail
gasoline
market.
section
2
(a)
of
the
amended
clayton
act
contains
two
independent
test
of
illegality.
it
prohibits
price
discrimination
where
the
effect
may
be
substantially
to
lessen
competition
or
to
tend,
to
monopoly
in
any
line
of
commerce.
and
then
it
has
another
test
to
injure,
destroy,
or
prevent
competition
with
any
person
who
either
grants
knowingly
receives
the
benefit
of
such
discrimination,
or
with
the
customers
of
either
one
of
the
then.
the
ninth
circuit
completely
ignored
the
substantiality
to
lessen
competition
standard,
a
carry
over
from
the
original
clayton
act
section
2
and
setting
aside
this
jury's
verdict.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
yes,
your
honor.
the
--
this
was
before
the
ninth
circuit,
it
was
before
the
jury,
both
standard
and
perkins
offered
charges
to
the
jury
and
the
judge
i
think
substantially
and
properly
charged
the
jury
so
that
this
question
of
over
all
injury
to
competition
and
tendency
toward
monopoly
was
proper
before
the
jury.
now,
i
would
say
that
that
in
retrospect,
both
perkins
and
standard
could've
been
far
more
explicit
and
extensive
in
submitting
proposed
charges
to
the
jury
and
the
judge
perhaps
could've
been
more
explicit
and
could've
charged
more
extensively.
but
the
fact
was
that
the
whole
question
of
injury
to
competition
and
a
tendency
toward
monopoly
was
before
the
jury
and
the
jury
even
though
not
as
elegantly
charged
as
one
--
as
some
might
wish
that
it
were
charged
was
substantially
charged
and
knew
what
the
raise
just
i
was,
knew
what
the

were,
knew
what
they
had
to
decide.
the

exalted
form
at
the
expense
of
economic
reality
by
imposing
an
artificial
three-level
limitation
on
section
2
(a)
to
prevent
discriminations
which
tends
substantially
lessen
competition
in
any
line
of
commerce.
it
failed
to
assign
any
way,
the
ninth
circuit
failed
to
assign
any
way,
the
fact
that
standard's
price
discrimination
has
caused
a
substantial
lessening
of
competition
in
the
pacific
northwest
wholesale
and
gasoline
markets
driving
out
of
business
one
of
the
areas
largest
independents.
moreover,
by
basing
that
limitation
exclusively
on
the
number
of
persons
in
the
distributive
chain
established
by
the
favored
purchaser,
that
decision,
if
the
court
please,
unless
reversed
will
enable
large
buyers
virtually
to
insure
statutory
immunity
to
suppliers
which
grant
them
favorable

concessions.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
i
think
we
have
a
different
factual
situation
but
the
realities
and
petroleum
marketing
are
such
that
it
is
the
price
of
the
retailer.
the
competition
exist
at
that
retail
level
and
if
any
one
went
up
that
change
gets
a
better
price
and
is
able
to
pass
along
at
the
retail
level
that
you
can
have
absolute
chaos
at
the
retail
level.
and
this
is
a
business
--
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
yes.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
we
don't
have
it
--
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
well,
we
have
alternative
theories
on
this
of
course
depending
on
how
you
read
the
evidence
but
the
--
we
believe
and
i
urge
upon
the
court
that
these
were
two
families
of
gasoline
dealers
and
that
through
the
economic
realities
that
the
retailers
are
tied
to
particular
suppliers,
the
gasoline
business
and
that
it
wouldn't
matter
if
there
was
a
lack
of
ownership
here
and
family
connection
if
the
discrimination
were
passed
from
signal
down
to
regal
stations
and
perkins
who
had
his
own
chain
of
stations
was
unable
to
compete.
the
damage
occurred
at
the
retail
level
because
perkins
either
had
to
take
a
loss
or
he
had
to
see
his
stations
compete
on
an
unequal
basis.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
i
think
you
have
to
go
back
mr.
justice
to
the
relationship
of
the
parties
with
the
supplier
if
the
parties
were
both
independent
as
signal
supplier
--
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
signal
and
perkins
--
signal
oil
and
gas
and
perkins
are
both
independent
of
standard
oil.
perkins
was
required
to
purchase
his
oil
from
standard
oil
and
signal
did
purchase
all
of
its
oil
from
a
gasoline
from
standard
oil
but
they
were
both
independent
of
standard
oil,
they
were
independent
dealers
and
wholesalers
and
if
the
perkins
company
is
unfairly
discriminated
against.
it
is
unable
to
pass
down
to
its
chain
of
distribution
the
equivalent
benefits
that
can
be
passed
through
by
signal
and
the
proof
of
the
putting
is
in
the
eating
at
the
retailer
level.
now,
i
think
it
makes
a
harder
case
if
there's
a
family
relationship
as
there
is
here
and
you
got
alternatives
which
one
didn't
have
in
the
hamm
brewing
case
where
and
duluth
and
superior,
the
distributor
--
two
distributors
of
the
hamm
company
were
unable
to
compete
across
the
state
lines
although
this
was
one
market.
but
the
superior
distributor
was
given
a
better
price
and
his
retailers
then
were
able
to
take
advantage
of
the
retailers
on
the
other
side
of
the
state
line
and
the
same
market
take
the
customers
away
simply
because
the
better
price
was
passed
on
the
line
at
the
retail
level.
as
we
read
it,
section
2
(a)
prohibits
all
price
discriminations
the
effect
of
which
may
be
substantially
to
lessen
competition
in
a
commercially
significant
product
and
geographic
market.
regardless
of
the
functional
level,
this
is
our
theory
of
the
case,
it
was
before
the
jury
and
all
of
the
economic
setting
and
the
charges
given
by
the
judge
and
it
is
in
this
instance
that
we
feel
that
basically
the
ninth
circuit
was
wrong.

decided
prior
to

the
court
rejected
the
defendant's
argument
that
its
price
discriminations
could
not
be
challenged
by
a
purchaser
because
the
words
in
any
line
of
commerce
must
be
confined
to
the
line
of
commerce
in
which
the
distributor
is
engaged.
in
other
words,
confined
to
what
is
called
primary
line
injury.
the
court
ruled
if
the
words
in

line
of

literally
were
satisfied
if
a
forbidden
fact
is
produced
in
one
of

the
point
in
the
favored
purchaser's
chain
of
distribution
of
which
injury
to
competition
is
first
felt
is
a
concern
only
with
respect
to
the
factual
question
of
causation
not
with
respect
to
whether
the
statute
has
been
violated
as
a
matter
of
law.
and
we
feel
that
this
court
should
bring
its
section
2
of
the
clayton
act
in
harmony
with
its
interpretations
in
the
van
camp
decision
prior
to
the
passage
of
robinson-patman
act
and
in
harmony
with
its
uniform
interpretations
of
similar
language
of
the
same
language
in
section
3
and
7
of
the
clayton
act.
standard
was
a
price
leader
and
the
principle
supplier
of
gasoline
in
pacific
northwest
and
perkins
was
bound
to
purchase
the
vast
bulk
if
not
all
of
his
gasoline
from
standard.
it
was
a
market
dominated
by
the
majors
where
the
independents
had
been
declining.
in
fact,
perkins
was
marketing
8%
of
standard's
gasoline
and
one-third
of
that
market
to
which
he
was
confined
and
during
the
claim
period
he
lost
13%
of
his
gallonage,
he
lost
50%
of
his
fuel
oil
business
which
is
tied
to
gasoline
as
the
record
shows,
and
signal,
the
distributor,
the
independent
distributor
from
standard
in
whose
favor
the
discrimination
was
granted,
gained
50%
during
that
claim
period
in
gallonage.
and
as
perkins'
expert
witness,
dr.
mann
testified
in
response
to
a
hypothetical
question
covering
the
same
record
evidence,
the
foreseeable
market
trend
in
that
area
was
toward
increase
concentration
a
decline
of
small
business
and
a
higher
gasoline
prices
and
he
said
this
significant
to
leave
which
i
doubly
believe
that
in
other
words
price
discrimination
and
monopoly
are
siamese
twins.
and
perkins
during
this
period
for
he
went
out
of
business
constantly
begged
standard
for
price
assistance.
it
was
only
one
month
before
signal's
present
one
on
the
stand
they've
been
denying
they
were
giving
price
assistance
that
they
finally
admitted
a
discrimination
of
$1
million.
and
perkins
finally
got
some
price
assistance,
it
was
a
small
amount
and
it
amounted
for
all
of
his
60
stations
to
what
standard
gave
one
of
its
branded
stations
in
a
75-day
period.
signal
was
even
able
during
the
claim
period
to
offer,
to
sell
to
perkins
gasoline
at
three-fourths
of
a
gallon
or
on
regular
and
eight-tenths
on
ethyl.
although,
standard
when
faced
with
this
denied
that
it
was
discriminating
in
favor
of
signal.
we
submit
on
a
basis
of
the
forgoing
that
the
jury
could
have
found
not
only
that
a
substantial
lessening
of
competition
was
threatened
but
that
as
a
substantial
diminution
in
the
vigor
of
competition
had
already
in
fact
occurred.
and
thus,
the
jury's
verdict
was
affordable
on
this
basis.
we
do
not
believe
that
it
was
the
intention
of
the
congress
in
changing
only
a
split
infinity
in
correcting
only
a
split
infinity
when
it
pass
the
robinson-patman
amendment
that
it
was
the
intent
of
congress
to
weaken
the
robinson-patman
amendment.
this
court
itself
has
said
quite
positively
to
the
contrary
in
the
anheuser-busch
decision.
the
legislative
history
and
i
quote
the
opinion
of
this
court,
“the
legislative
history
of
these
amendments
leaves
no
doubt
that
the
congress
was
intent
upon
strengthening
the
clayton
act
provisions
not
weakening
them.”
the
congress
did
not
intend
that
that
language
of
regarding
competition
injury
to
competition
and
a
tendency
toward
monopoly
should
become
mere
surplusage
with
respect
to
the
amended
clayton
act.
it
conferred
upon
small
business
a
less
stringent
remedy
when
it
pass
that
robinson-patman
amendment
but
it
left
the
more
stringent
remedy
to
those
like
perkins
who
are
amply
able
with
an
ample
record
to
prove
the
violation
of
the
original
standards
of
the
clayton
act
section
2.
thank
you,
your
honors.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
it
was
the
auditor
--
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
it
was
the
auditor
who
was
put
on
the
stand
by
standard
and
mr.
maclaury
examined
him
and
did
not
ask
any
question
with
respect
to
the
price.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
mr.
maclaury
said
yesterday
in
his
argument
that
the
minority
ownership
and
western
hyway
lay
with
the
officers
of
western
hyway.
i
quote
you
from
the
printed
record
a
question
to
the
same
auditor
by
mr.
maclaury
with
respect
to
the
years
1955,
1956,
1957.
what
entities
or
what
persons
own
the
stock,
a
capital
stock
of
western
hyway
oil
company?
answer:
in
western
hyway
oil
company,
60%
of
the
shares
were
owned
by
signal
oil
and
gas
company
and
40%
was
owned
by
three
individuals
who
were
corporate
officers
but
he
didn't
ask
corporate
officers
of
signal
or
corporate
officers
of
western
hyway.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
i
think
sir
that
that
there
two
--
there
are
at
least
two
possible
alternatives
here
for
this
court.
i
believe
beyond
question
that
the
ninth
circuit
was
wrong
with
respect
to
the
old
clayton
act.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
i
think
that
the
case
can
be
proved
under
old
clayton
act
by
showing
a
discrimination.
mr.
maclaury
has
indicated
the
jury
--
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
perkins
and
signal,
there
was
a
--
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
the
line
of
commerce
is
a
whole
northwest,
the
petroleum
marketing
as
our
expert
witness
indicated.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
yes,
sir.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
the
competition
is
down
at
the
retail
level.
this
is
where
the
injury
is
felt.
this
is
where
the
price
war
started.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
yes
your
honor
and
in
this
instance,
retail
and
the
wholesale
because
perkins
had
a
average
profit
of
1.54%
and
standard
itself
indicated
that
it
took
two
cents
to
live.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
the
perkins
had
2.4%
of
the
overall
market.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
that
is
in
the
record.
that's
the
equivalent
of
what
sun
oil
has
nationally.
perkins
sold
8%
of
standard's
gallonage
in
that
market.
standard
had
30%
of
that
market.
perkins
lost
13%
of
its
gallonage
of
gasoline,
50%
of
its
gallonage
of
fuel
oil
during
the
claim
period
and
signal
gained
50%
during
the
claim
period.
perkins
was
making
an
average
of
1.54
cents
a
gallon,
standard's
own
witnesses
stated
that
it
took
2
cents
a
gallon
to
live
and
if
you
added
the
discrimination
which
standard
gave
to
signal
to
perkins'
price,
perkins
would
have
had
2.2
cents
per
gallon
which
would
have
given
him
a
fighting
chance
of
living
in
that
market.
now,
there's
no
evidence
as
to
the
price
that
regal
sold
in
that
market.
standard's
own
executive
acknowledged
that
regal
had
a
better
price
than
perkins
and
that
regal
would
wreck
that
market
unless
something
was
done
to
control
them.
there's
no
evidence
of
western's
price
of
course
to
regal.
standard
was
in
a
position
to
supply
this
but
didn't
do
it.
and
in
that
connection,
this
court
has
held
with
respect
to
the
matter
of
--
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
yes,
your
honor
and
if
i
might
return
to
this
question
of
control,
i
think
that
we
adduced
a
sufficient
evidence
from
which
the
jury
could
have
inferred
that
there
was
control
with
respect
to
regal
and
western
by
signal.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
the
amount
of
ownership
and
--
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
there
is
other
evidence
that
standard
treated
an
offer
made
to
western
hyway
for
the
purchase
of
gasoline
as
an
offer
made
to
signal,
its
customer.
that
is
in
the
record.
and
we
think
that
looking
at
the
whole
evidence,
the
whole
record,
the
jury
could
reasonably
have
inferred
that
there
was
control.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
not
standing
alone
sir.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
the
theory
was
that
standard
gave
a
better
price
to
signal
which
resulted
as
it
was
passed
down
the
line
in
a
price
war
which
spread
from
portland
as
one
would
drop
a
pebble
into
a
pool
of
water
throughout
the
northwest
territory,
in
northwest
market.
also
there
is
considerable
proof
that
that
standard
because
of
this
price
war
gave
special
assistance
to
its
retail
stations
which
were
branded
stations
which
were
competing
with
the
perkins
stations
just
as
perkins
stations
were
competing
with
the
regal
stations.
so
that
what
you
have
here
as
dr.
munn
pointed
out
in
his
testimony
is
an
examination
of
the
whole
petroleum
marketing
situation
in
the
northwest
and
based
upon
his
hypotheticals,
he
found
that
there
was
a
lessening
of
competition,
a
tendency
to
work
monopoly,
and
a
probability
of
higher
prices.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
i
think
sir
that
under
the
old
clayton
act,
it
makes
no
difference
with
respect
to
a
showing
of
injury
not
based
upon
functions.
but
--
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
--
alternatively
--
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
this
is
the
first
alternative
spelled
out
in
the
amended
clayton
act
which
is
a
carryover
of
the
language,
the
same
language
used
in
sections
3
and
7
which
this
court
has
interpreted
many
times.
i
say
under
that
--
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
i'm
talking
about
the
amended,
the
robinson-patman.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
section
2
(a),
amendments
to
the
clayton
act
which
carried
over
in
the
amendments.
the
first
alternative
injured
the
competition
and
tendency
toward
monopoly
and
added
the
functional
amendment
to
the
clayton
act
under
which
i
also
think
we
have
adequate
evidence
here
in
this
record
from
which
the
jury
could
have
found
that
the
requisite
injury.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
section
2
(a)
has
been
glossed
at
the
functional
level
many
times.
i
think
it's
time
this
court
ruled
on
the
first
alternative
and
made
that
first
alternative
applicable
as
it
has
made
the
summarily
language
at
or
under
sections
3
and
7.
thank
you.
