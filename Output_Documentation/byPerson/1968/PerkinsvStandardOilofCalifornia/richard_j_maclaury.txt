mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
outset,
we
emphasize
that
this
is
not
case
of
predatory
or
widespread
discriminations
aimed
by
standard
at
eliminating
a
customer.
to
the
contrary,
in
the
1950's,
petitioners
and
some
four
or
five
other
jobbers
were
important
customers
of
standard
in
the
northwest.
these
jobbers
accounted
were
a
large
percentage
of
standard's
sales
in
that
area,
enabled
standard
to
gain
access
to
a
market,
it
could
not
otherwise
reach
and
this
was
a
market
comprise
of
people
who
thinks
they
don't
buy
major
brand
gasoline.
they
prefer
to
purchase
minor
brand
gasoline
from
the
local
dealer.
in
these
circumstances,
there
was
absolutely
no
commercial
risk
why
standard
should
wish
to
drive
whether
of
its
customers
in
the
market.
predatory
pricing
after
all
is
associated
with
the
marketer
who
attempts
to
enhance
his
position
in
the
market.
but
after
all
when
perkins
terminated
his
contract
with
standard,
it
was
union
oil
company
of
california
gasoline
that
was
sold
through
his
stations
not
standard's
and
certainly
that
was
not
a
situation
that
standard
sought
to
instigate.
and
similarly,
it
was
not
in
standard's
interest
to
instigate
widespread
price
loss
which
would
cost
the
company
vast
sums
of
money
by
way
of
prices
assistance
to
its
dealers.
this
case
involves
three
basic
claims.
one
is
the
discrimination
in
price
of
the
gasoline
to
signal.
two,
the
claim
discriminations
in
the
price
of
gasoline
to
standard's
branded
dealers;
and
three,
the
section
2
(e)
and
2
(d)
discriminations
in
favor
of
branded
--
of
standard's
branded
dealers.
now,
as
to
signal,
there
are
two
claims.
counsel
so
far
i
believe
it
mentioned
only
one.
it
was
the
claim
in
the
centralia-seattle
area
and
there
was
a
claim
in
portland-vancouver
area.
the
facts
are
that
in
1955,
signal
first
purchased
gasoline
from
standard
in
seattle.
there,
perkins
was
buying
gasoline
but
it
was
union's
gasoline
which
perkins
purchased
through
westway
and
perkins
competed
with
signal's
customers
harris
and
others
in
seattle
but
he
competed
with
westway
gasoline
or
union
gasoline
not
standard's
gasoline.
now,
some
80
miles
to
the
south
of
seattle
there's
a
small
town
in
centralia
and
there
perkins
had
a
customer
named
carter
and
it
was
claimed
that
signal
reached
out
to
one
of
its
wholesalers
and
took
this
customer
carter
away.
the
facts
are
that
neither
signal
nor
any
of
signal's
customers
ever
sold
any
gasoline
in
centralia.
now,
the
second
market
involving
signal
is
portland-vancouver.
signal
commenced
buying
from
standard,
in
portland
in
august
of
1956.
signal
resold
all
of
this
gasoline
to
western
hyway.
signal
by
the
way
had
absolutely
no
stock
with
ownership
connection
with
standard.
western
hyway
was
owned
60%
by
signal
and
the
remaining
of
the
stock
was
owned
by
western's
corporate
officers.
western
sold
all
of
this
gasoline
except
for
a
minor
amount
which
is
not
pertinent
to
this
lawsuit,
the
three
regal
stations
in
portland.
those
regal
stations
were
owned
55%
of
the
stock
by
western
and
the
remainder
by
persons
having
no
connection
with
western.
the
important
fact
is
that
when
regal
opened
the
business
in
portland
in
september,
signal
was
paying
standard
a
higher
price
for
gasoline
then
perkins
was
paying.
and
at
all
times
in
this
lawsuit
from
september
from
1956
until
june
of
1957
the
price
paid
by
western
hyway,
regal
supplier
the
gasoline
was
higher
than
the
price
paid
by
regal.
i
say
that
was
until
june
of
1957.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
the
price
paid
by
regal,
excuse
me,
when
i
said
that
i
misspoke
myself.
the
price
paid
by
western
hyway
regal
supplier
for
gasoline
was
higher
than
the
price
paid
by
perkins.
there
was
no
evidence
in
this
case
of
the
price
paid
by
regal.
after
november
1,
1957,
western's
price
was
some
35
ten-thousandths
of
a
cent
higher
than
the
price
paid
by
perkins.
so
the
summary
on
signal
is
that
signal
never
sold
to
a
retailer
and
signal
never
sold
through
its
wholesaler
or
directly
to
anyone
in
centralia.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
no.
the
situation
in
neither
market
was
not
true
mr.
justice
white.
the
situation
in
seattle
was
that
signal
sold
to
one
b.f.
harris,
a
jobber
the
same
as
perkins.
perkins
and
b.f.
harris
in
seattle
sought
the
business
of
one
carter
in
seattle.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
well
we
–-
technically,
we
would
call
them
jobbers
but
mr.
justice
there
are
(voice
overlap).
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
no,
signal,
we
would
not
call
a
jobber.
signal
was
an
integrated
oil
company.
it
was
more
on
the
level
of
standard
but
it
sold
wholesale
to
jobbers.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
yes,
it
sold
in
wholesale.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
perkins
sold
at
a
wholesale
level.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
no,
i
would
say
that
signal
and
perkins
was
not
in
competition.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
they
weren't
selling
the
same
customers
if
i
may
analyze
that
for
you.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
that
is
what
i'm
saying
and
i'd
like
to
go
to
seattle
market
--
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
no,
it's
not
in
this
circumstance.
we
go
to
take
portland
for
example,
signal
sold
only
to
western
in
portland.
now,
as
to
portland
--
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
--
perkins
had
by
agreement
in
contract
with
the
others
who
would
sign
standard
contract
with
them
precluded
himself
from
selling
gasoline
in
portland.
perkins
gave
the
portland
market
to
file
and
harass
his
cosigners
on
the
contract
with
standard.
secondly,
perkins
sold
to
distributors
such
as
his
nephew
in
vancouver
and
sold
to
dealers
who
would
tie
to
him
by
leases
or
to
dealers
where
he
owned
the
retail
stations.
and
so
there
was
narrow
any
competition
between
signal
and
perkins
for
the
business
of
western.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
you
know
generally
speaking,
--
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
no,
as
a
practical
matter,
perkins
could
not
have
taken
signal's
only
customer
in
portland
and
signal
had
only
one
customer
in
portland
and
that
was
western
hyway.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
as
matters
developed,
i
don't
know
the
record
doesn't
show
that
the
time
that
perkins
went
out
of
business,
signal
still
had
one
customer
in
portland
and
that
was
western
hyway
and
as
i
say
perkins
had
precluded
himself
from
seeking
that
business
by
contract
with
his
cosigners
under
standard
agreement.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
well,
i
say
that
they
are
not
in
direct
competition
for
the
same
business
in
the
same
place
and
the
same
time.
i
think
that's
the
definition
of
competition,
generally
accepted
under
robinson-patman.
now,
i
might
refer
to
this
court's
decision
in
fred
meyer.
there,
the
same
concept
of
competition
was
suggested.
fred
meyer,
as
the
court
will
recall,
involved
the
2
(d)
claim
of
discrimination.
the
manufacturer
sold
to
a
direct
buying
retailer
and
also
sold
to
a
wholesaler.
the
federal
trade
commission
suggested
and
argued
that
because
the
wholesaler
was
really
competing
for
the
same
customer's
dollars
as
the
retailer.
the
wholesaler
was
entitled
to
the
same
promotional
payments
as
the
retailer
was
getting.
but
this
court
rejected
that
concept
of
competition
and
said
specifically
that
despite
the
broader
term
distribution
used
in
section
2
(d)
which
is
broader
term
than
the
term
resale
in
2
(a),
the
congress
did
not
intend
the
word
“competition”
as
used
in
the
robinson-patman
act
would
have
that
broad
meaning.
going
to
the
seattle
market,
there,
signal
sold
to
jobbers
who
were
on
the
same
level
as
perkins
and
i've
mentioned
one
b.f.
harris
and
b.f.
harris
and
perkins
were
certainly
competing
for
the
same
business
but
signal
and
perkins
as
a
practical
factual
matter
as
the
record
shows
that
they
were
not.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
yes.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
well,
i
don't
believe,
my
--
our
position
here
of
course
that
perkins
did
not
suffer
any
damage
whatsoever
from
standard
sales
to
signal
switching
to
the
portland
market
and
to
follow
up
your
honor's
question.
there,
the
market
is
structured
this
way,
standard
sold
to
western,
standard
sold
to
signal,
signal
sold
to
western,
western
sold
to
regal
which
was
a
retail
outlet.
regal
did
in
fact
compete
with
some
of
the
stations
supplied
by
perkins
across
the
river
in
vancouver.
and
it
was
said
at
that
level
where
we
had
the
competition.
it
was
there
where
there
was
head
to
head
competition
for
the
dollars
of
the
same
customers.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
there
was
real
competition.
we
must
acknowledge
that
at
the
retail
level
and
our
whole
point
here
and
the
only
real
matter
decided
by
the
court
of
appeals
was
that
because
that
competition
which
perkins
asserted
injured
him
was
at
the
fourth
level
and
because
congress
did
not
extend
the
robinson-patman
amendments
down
to
that
fourth
level,
perkins
was
not
entitled
to
recover
here
for
any
injury
that
may
have
been
caused
to
him
by
regal
assuming
that
regal
did
cause
that
injury.
do
i
answer
your
question
mr.
justice?
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
well,
if
i
understand
your
honor's
question,
my
answer
would
be
this,
that
because
the
operating
people
making
the
operating
decisions
in
western,
making
the
price
in
business
in
western
owned
45%
of
the
stock
and
because
they
were
making
the
decision,
i
would
expect
these
decisions
to
be
as
much
in
the
interest
of
these
independents
as
it
would
in
signal.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
well,
60%
your
honor.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
western.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
55%
your
honor.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
or
the
facts
and
mr.
justice
fortas
i'd
like
to
pick
up
the
facts
on
that
situation.
first,
we
go
to
the
court
of
appeals'
finding
that
there
was
no
evidence
in
the
record
of
operational
control
and
then
we
look
at
the
invoices
from
signal
to
western
and
there's
all
every
invoice,
every
sale
representing
every
sale
from
signal
to
western
is
in
this
record.
they
are
summarized
at
page
22
of
our
brief
and
they
show
that
the
prices
to
western
were
higher
than
the
prices
of
standard
to
perkins.
and
so,
signal
in
other
words
took
that
price
differential
of
some
less
than
a
half
of
the
sale
which
would
receive
by
the
way
only
after
january
(voice
overlap)
to
put
in
his
pocket.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
yes,
but
i
don't
understand
how
that
could
happen
here
--
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
i
think
petitioner
who
puts
his
finger
right
on
it
in
his
brief
when
he
states
that
the
question
of
control,
mr.
justice
fortas,
is
a
question
of
fact.
now,
this
fact,
this
issue
control
was
never
passed
on
to
the
jury.
it
was
never
submitted
to
the
jury.
we
suggested
an
instruction
which
would
ask
the
jury
or
instruct
the
juries
that
one
of
the
issues
here
was
whether
or
not
this
price
differential
was
passed
on
and
the
court
refused
to
give
that
instruction.(voice
overlap)
so
the
jury
really
never
decided
this
question.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
well,
depending
on
whether
the
impact
there
would
probably
be
on
the
third
level
but
certainly
a
possibility
of
violation
of
2
(a)
depending
on
impact.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
of
course,
in
every
other
field
of
the
law
for
example,
in
creditor's
rights.
where
a
creditor
wishes
to
attack
the
separate
corporate
identities
of
two
corporations,
it
is
the
burden
on
the
creditor
to
show
that
there
is
an
alter
ego
situation
here
and
i
don't
see
why
the
situation
shouldn't
be
the
same
here.
so
far
as
the
back
--
that
signal
owned
a
part
of
western
and
that
western
owned
the
part
of
regal,
that
would
make
no
difference
whatsoever
if
there
was,
if
each
of
these
entities
did
operate
independently.
it
will
be
exactly
the
same
situation
as
standard
had
sold
to
signal
and
that
signal
had
sold
to
a
completely
different
independent
identity
and
in
turn
it
sold
to
a
completely
independent
identity.
the
only
question
is
the
question
of
fact,
this
petition
has
points
out
and
there
was
no
evidence
to
overcome
and
i
think
the
presumption
should
be
was
that
these
entities
were
truly
independent.
the
--
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
no,
i
think
but
the
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
--
there
was
no
evidence
on
it
and
they
left
that
open
for
retrial.
they
left
that
issue
open
for
retrial.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
that
is
correct.
i
agree
with
that.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
it
left
the
question
of
control
opened
and
specifically
stated
in
response
to
the
petition
rehearing
that
that
question
is
open
for
retrial.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
no,
they
couldn't
decide
it
because
there
was
no
evidence
on
the
question
of
control.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
that's
correct.
that's
precisely
the
only
holding
on
2
(a)
that
the
court
of
appeals
made.
now,
--
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
i
don't
believe
i
understand
your
honor's
question.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
certainly,
his
line
of
commerce
is
involved.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
yes.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
well,
i
entirely
agree
with
petitioner
that
had
this
case
been
submitted
to
the
court
of
appeals
under
the
original
language
of
the
clayton
act
and
why
is
that
--
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
well,
clearly
--
i
would
say
this,
i
agree
with
the
legal
proposition
that
the
original
language
of
the
clayton
act
has
no
limitations
in
so
far
as
level
is
concerned,
so
far
as
van
camp
is
concerned
that
case,
that
issue
was
decided
if
there
was
a
substantial
lessening
of
competition
on
any
level
--
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
--
why
that
case
that
that's
the
end
of
this
lawsuit.
now,
to
come
back
your
honor's
other
suggestion
that
it
was
submitted
to
the
jury,
i
don't
agree
with
petitioner's
point
of
view
on
that
at
all.
i
was
in
the
trial
of
the
case,
the
case
would
never
focus
on
a
general
lessening
of
competition
in
the
market.
it
is
perfectly
true
that
--
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
it
--
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
yes.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
yes.
competition
would
--
regal
was
lessened
and
perkins
himself
was
injured
rather
than
in
entire
market.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
well,
the
instruction
to
the
jury
did
focus
on
that
in
that,
it
named
very
specifically
to
the
competitors
of
perkins
who
would
be
regal,
signal,
western,
and
the
dealers.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
no,
there's
--
i
have
no
quarrel
with
petitioner
on
this
at
all.
it
appears
that
those
instructions
appears
at
page
54.
they
were
given
in
the
alternative,
the
jury
was
told
that
it
must
found
--
find
and
i'm
reading
at
second
line,
to
that
the
reasonable
probable
effect
of
the
discrimination
may
have
been
to
substantially
lessen
competition
and
then
in
the
disjunctive
or
tend
to
create
a
monopoly
in
the
line
of
commerce
or
--
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
--
then
robinson-patman
and
to
destroy
or
prevent
competition
with
perkins
of
oregon,
etcetera,
etcetera.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
there
was
no
evidence
that
signal
controlled
regal.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
there
is
a
majority
stock
ownership
mr.
justice.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
as
the
court
of
appeals
pointed
out
that
signal
was
in
the
position
to
control
western
and
that
western
was
in
the
position
to
control
regal.
but
there
were
no
interlocking
directors
and
there
was
no
demonstration
of
actual
control.
i'm
not
saying
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
the
offices
of
the
corporation
who
are
operating
the
corporation
control
the
corporation.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
they
are
elected
at
the
stockholders
meeting
and
speaking
yes.
but
i
think
it's
especially
significant
here
that
the
minority
stockholders
of
western
were
the
operating
officers
and
you
would
expect
them
as
they
did
often
rate
that
company
against
the
best
interest
of
signal
when
they
were
purchasing
gasoline
from
others
than
signal
and
deprive
signal
of
its
wholesale
profits
what
signal
should
grant.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
no.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
no.
no,
but
there
was
no
evidence
that
the
president
of
the
chairman
of
the
board
or
any
officer
of
signal
directed
the
pricing
decisions
of
western.
in
absence
of
that
kind
of
evidence,
you
would
expect
that
western's
pricing
decisions
will
be
independent.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
that
assumption
might
be
valid
mr.
justice
douglas
but
here
in
this
case
we
had
quarrels
between
the
owners
of
signal,
the
majority
owners
of
western
and
the
signal
operating
officers
as
to
where
they
would
buy
their
gasoline
and
western
insisted
that
they
have
buy
their
gasoline
wherever
they
could
get
the
cheaper
price
even
though
this
deprive
its
parent
of
its
wholesale
profits.
and
that
would
indicate
to
me
a
lack
of
control.
now,
they
say
before,
i'm
not
assuming
for
a
moment
or
suggesting
for
a
moment
as
the
court
of
appeals
pointed
out
signal
was
in
a
position
to
control
but
there
was
no
evidence
that
it
did
and
--
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
were
in
control.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
yes,
whether
it
was
purchased
from
signal
or
wherever
else
they
could
get
it,
fortunately.
they
were
certainly
weren't
going
to
operate
that
company
so
as
to
advantage
the
minority
of
the
majority
ownership
in
signal
if
they
could
avoid
it
and
they
did
avoid
it.
going
back
to
my
argument
is
that,
we
have
no
disagreement
here
that
the
original
language
of
the
clayton
act
extends
to
all
levels
of
competition.
our
point
here
is
that
this
standard
was
presented
to
the
jury
in
the
alternative.
certainly,
the
standard
of
the
robinson-patman
act
provisions
was
more
or
less
onerous
burden
in
the
standard
of
the
original
clayton
act
and
one
would
expect
that
the
--
having
a
choice
the
jury
would
make
the
decision
in
--
on
a
basis
of
the
--
or
simplified
unless
onerous
robinson-patman
amendments.
but
before
the
court
of
appeals,
our
objection
here
to
raising
this
problem
here
is
not
a
technical
one.
the
matter
was
not
presented
to
the
court
of
appeals.
it
was
not
briefed
to
the
court
of
appeals.
the
court
of
appeals
never
had
an
opportunity
to
define
this
market
either
on
a
functional
basis
or
on
geographical
basis.
there
are
other
jobbers
in
the
northwest
supplied
by
competitors
of
standard.
there
was
no
showing
of
the
impact
of
signal's
operations
of
these
other
jobbers
or
on
the
retail
outlets
of
the
other
jobbers.
the
only
showing
of
an
impact
at
all
or
an
adverse
effect
of
all
was
on
the
competitor
perkins
and
that's
the
limit
of
the
finding
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
its
footnote
6.
so,
i
don't
disagree
with
the
proposition
of
law
but
my
only
suggestion
is
that
this
court
has
before
it
the
abstract
question
of
whether
or
not
the
standard
of
the
original
clayton
act
is
limited
to
the
fourth
level
or
to
the
third
level
or
to
the
second
level.
the
answer
to
that
is
no,
van
camp
settled
that
and
there
isn't
a
record
here
that
would
support
a
holding
that
the
original
clayton
act
should
apply
here
in
this
case.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
yes
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
think
you
would.
i
don't
think
there's
a
matter
of
degree
of
control.
i
think
petitioner
has
put
his
finger
right
on
the
question.
it's
a
question
of
fact
in
every
case.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
yes.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
and
that's
where
i'm
in
agreement
with
them
at
least
on
that
--
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
otherwise,
we
would
get
in
there.
it
seems
to
me
the
rule
would
be
so
vague
whether
it
would
be
30%
control,
50%
control,
75%
control
and
despite
these
percentages
the
factual
situation
may
vary
on
each
one
of
this.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
well,
it
probably
--
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
one
other
aspect
to
the
fourth
level
point
that
we
have
here.
there
is
no
question
at
all
that
the
plain
language
of
the
robinson-patman
amendments
limits
the
impact
to
the
third
level.
it
declares
a
price
discrimination,
a
violation
of
law
if
there
is
a
lessening
of
competition
with
the
grantor,
a
lessening
of
competition,
a
second
level
of
the
recipient
or
thirdly,
a
lessening
of
competition
at
the
third
level
with
the
favored
buyer
of
the
recipient
in
this
case
western.
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
limits
it
to
that
level,
this
court
held
in
standard
oil,
congress
knew
very
well
how
to
designate
the
levels
of
competition
which
intended
to
protect.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
no,
i
do
not
think
it
is
the
same
standard.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
two
reasons.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
it
certainly
would
and
(voice
overlap).
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
correct.
then,
it
would
have
to
be
a
general
depression
and
lessening
of
competition
in
the
market
generally.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
and
there
was
no
evidence
of
such
an
effect
in
this
case.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
generally.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
i
think
that's
correct.
yes,
your
honor
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
i
would
have
to
say
to
the
general
question
no
mr.
justice
but
let
me
make
sure
that
i
understand
the
question.
i
think
it's
--
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
yes.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
well,
first,
let
me
answer
it
this
way,
going
and
i'll
get
to
your
specific
question,
going
to
the
broader
antitrust
policy
i
do
not
believe
that
the
broader
antitrust
policy
under
the
sherman
act
would
want
to
prohibit
price
discriminations
in
all
situations.
i
think
or
rigidified
by
price
but
within
that
broad
policy,
certainly,
i
think
it
is
a
purpose
of
the
robinson-patman
act
and
section
2
of
the
clayton
act
to
put
competitors
generally
on
the
same
pricing
level.
yes,
so
that
they
can
start
off
at
an
equal
start
and
congress
in
order
to
accommodate
itself
to
the
broader
general,
the
broader
view
of
the
law
that
should
have
competitive
pricing
and
bargaining
on
pricing
restricted
the
reach
of
robinson-patman
so
that
it
declared
a
price
difference,
price
differential,
unlawful
only
where
there
was
a
lessening
of
competition
that
one
of
these
three
levels.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
yes.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
i
have
no
problem
with
that
at
all
your
honor.
i
think
that
that
would
be
a
situation
that
would
be
a
violation
of
robinson-patman
act.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
and
i
think
as
i
mentioned
--
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
i
say
that
that
was
not
shown
and
that
was
not
the
situation
here
and
in
fact
the
evidence
intended
to
show
just
the
other
way.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
i
think
it
did,
yes.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
well,
the
problem
here
mr.
justice
white
was
--
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
yes.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
no,
that
is
correct.
but
--
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
no,
i
don't
think
that
the
jury
understood
this
problem.
we
had
--
we
have
asked
the
court
at
the
trial
level
to
submit
to
the
jury
the
question
whether
the
price
differential
as
small
as
it
was,
was
passed
down
to
regal.
the
court
refused
to
give
that
instruction.
the
court
instructed
the
jury
contrary
to
our
request
that
perkins
and
signal
were
competitors
and
i
think
what
the
jury
did
was
to
take
that
instruction
assumed
that
perkins
was
injured
and
assumed
it
was
injured
as
a
result
of
the
price
to
signal.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
i
think
under
that
erroneous
instruction
it
very
well
could
have.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
which
i
say
was
non-existing
and
certainly
wasn't
proved.
i
see
the
--
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
we'll
recess
now.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i'd
like
to
return
for
a
moment
to
the
question
mr.
justice
douglas
asked
yesterday
and
the
suggestion
that
there
must
have
been
a
control
by
western
over
regal
because
of
western's
55%
stock
interest
in
regal
and
my
response
to
mr.
justice
douglas'
question
was
that
although
western
was
in
a
position
to
control
regal,
there
was
no
evidence
that
there
was
in
fact
control.
i'd
like
to
add
and
answer
to
this
morning
and
say
that
i
think
it
will
be
recognized
that
western
as
a
majority
stockholder
in
regal
had
an
obligation
to
the
minority
stockholders
in
regal
and
it
was
western's
obligation
as
a
majority
stockholder
to
honor
its
obligations
to
the
minority
and
to
see
that
regal
could
resell
its
gasoline
at
a
price
that
would
return
to
regal
a
normal
profit.
in
other
words,
that
the
majority
in
western
had
an
obligation
to
refrain
from
dealing
with
regal
and
controlling
regal
to
the
point
that
regal
would
operate
at
a
loss.
now,
the
fact
is
that
western
paid
signal
slightly
higher
or
approximately
the
same
prices
towards
gasoline
that
perkins
paid
standard.
now,
signal
owned
a
majority
interest
in
western
and
was
obligated
to
treat
the
minority
interest
in
western
fairly
and
to
refrain
from
compelling
western
to
operate
at
a
loss,
or
to
sell
at
a
loss
to
regal.
beyond
this,
the
fact
of
the
matter
was
that
the
minority
stockholders
in
western
were
actually
the
controlling
officers
and
control
the
operations
of
western
and
they
were
in
a
very
good
position
to
see
that
their
own
interests
were
properly
taken
care
of.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
it
certainly
does,
yes.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
no,
i
do
not
believe
so,
--
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
--
your
honor.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
yes,
they
did.
i'd
like
to
step
back
a
moment
and
say
this
that
the
respondents
asked
that
this
question
of
passing
on
be
put
to
the
jury.
the
court
refused
to
do
that
and
i
might
say
there
that
on
page
5
of
our
brief,
--
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
no.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
i
think
that's
correct.
and
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
there's
no
dispute
between
petitioners
and
respondents
as
to
the
price
that
western
paid
for
its
gasoline.
that
evidence
was
put
in
on
the
basis
of
invoices.
the
invoices
of
signal
oil
and
gas
to
western
and
there
was
no
conflict
in
it
and
that
that
evidence,
that
invoice
evidence
is
summarize
in
the
footnote
at
page
22
of
our
brief.
and
it
shows
that
for
virtually
all
of
the
time,
western
paid
a
higher
price
for
gasoline
than
perkins.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
well,
that's
--
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
now,
that
--
that
i
think
goes
to
the
very
question
in
the
policy
question
as
to
why
congress
cut
this
liability
off
at
the
third
level.
regal
as
established
in
the
evidence
had
very
large
well-situated
stations.
they
concentrated
on
the
sale
of
gasoline.
they
concentrated
on
large
volume
stations.
they
open
with
the
well-advertised
campaign
and
it
was
perkins
own
marketing
experts,
it
wasn't
the
professor,
or
somebody,
theoretician.
he
had
actually
worked
for
years
in
the
portland
market.
he
was
an
independent
this
time
and
he
testified
that
he
was
in
portland
then,
and
he
said
it
wasn't
the
prices
of
regal
that
had
the
impact.
the
real
impact
of
regal
was
on
its
tremendous
advertising
campaign,
its
promotional
campaign
and
its
method
of
selling
of
a
gasoline.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
no.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
i
think
we
have
to
accept
for
the
purpose
of
this
record
here
that
there
was
a
reduction
in
the
price
in
portland
of
some
four
cents
immediately
after
regal
came
on
the
market.
but
mr.
justice
white,
we
could
not
attribute
that
four-cent
reduction
in
the
portland
market
to
the
less
than
half
cent
advantage
that
signal
had
over
perkins
and
at
the
very
time
that
regal
opened,
perkins
was
paying
a
higher
price,
and
signal
was
paying
a
higher
price
than
perkins.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
there
is
no
direct
evidence
in
this
record
as
to
what
regal
was
paid
except
the
ordinary
interest
and
i
think
it
should
be
drawn
that
western
paid
a
higher
price
than
perkins
and
we
can
assume
the
western
is
going
to
sell
to
regal
a
loss.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
yes,
that
is
what
i'm
suggesting
and
i'm
suggesting
also
that
because
of
regal's
more
efficient
operation,
regal
was
probably
taking
a
lower
profit
than
these
other
marketers.
they
were
probably
operating
on
a
large
volume
and
low
unit
cost.
and
there
also,
regal
did
not
perform
the
ordinary
regular
services
that
you
connect
with
service
stations
such
as
the
lubrication
and
repairs
and
that
sort
of
thing.
they
very
efficiently
concentrated
on
the
sale
of
gasoline.
that
was
the
testimony
of
petitioners
and
witnesses.
and
i
think
a
lot
of
it
could
be
attributed
to
that.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
you're
absolutely
correct,
--
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
--
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
you're
absolutely
correct,
of
course.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
i
would
have
to
answer
that
mr.
justice
fortas
in
this
way,
without
more,
the
answer
would
be
no.
i
still
think
it
would
take
a
factual
inquiry
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
was
actual
direction
by
signal
of
the
decisions
of
western
and
by
western
on
the
decisions
of
regal.
i
don't
think
the
inquiry
of
the
burden
would
be
nearly
as
strong
or
as
heavy
as
it
is
in
this
situation.
but
of
course
that
is
not
the
situation
that
we
got
here.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
i'd
like
to
go
one
step
further
than
that.
i
believe
it
is
the
presumption
in
virtually
every
deal
of
the
law
that
where
there
are
separate
entities,
these
separate
entities
make
their
own
decisions
but
i
recognize
that
whether
it's
a
100%
control,
the
burden
of
showing
the
contrary
is
not
nearly
the
burden
that
the
petitioner
would
have
here.
we
also
have
this
further
problem
which
i
was
going
to
mention
mr.
justice
fortas,
that
where
signal
is
holding
itself
out
as
an
independent
corporation,
where
western
is
holding
itself
out
as
an
independent
corporation,
where
regal
is
holding
itself
out
as
an
independent
corporation.
if
there
was
actual
price
control
down
the
line,
i
think
there
will
be
a
serious
danger
of
violation
of
the
sherman
act
and
i
don't
think
such
a
serious
violation
of
the
law
can
be
lightly
inferred
just
on
the
matter
of
this
control
--
of
stock
control.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
well,
that
brings
me
--
i
think
it
is
relevant
and
i
think
it
brings
me
to
--
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
well,
it
would
here.
i'll
put
it
this
way,
if
the
ultimate
seller
was
western
hyway
on
the
third
level,
then
control
makes
no
difference
at
all
but
even
if
this
price
differential
had
been
passed
on
all
the
way
down
to
regal
at
the
fourth
level,
then
i
say
that
that
is
beyond
the
purview
of
robinson-patman.
mr.
justice
white,
that
brings
me
to
the
--
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
unless
you
view
it
as
a
line
of
commerce
case
as
we
acknowledged
yesterday
and
that
brings
me
to
a
further
answer
perhaps
to
the
questions
you
asked
yesterday
and
that
was
this
question
that
the
original
language
of
the
clayton
act
decide.
we're
not
signal
and
perkins'
competitors
on
the
secondary
level.
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
that
within
the
meaning
of
the
language
of
the
robinson-patman
act,
the
answer
must
be
no.
the
first
answer
is
that
robinson-patman
uses
the
word
competition
in
its
practical
sense.
that
means
as
an
endeavor
by
two
or
more
persons
to
get
the
same
trade
from
the
same
people
at
the
same
place
at
the
same
time.
now,
the
evidence
is
--
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
well,
i'm
certain
that
perkins
was
competing
with
somebody,
yes.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
well,
let
me
answer
that
--
let
me
respond
to
that
this
way.
just
because
somewhere
down
the
line,
a
purchaser
of
signal
gasoline
may
be
third,
fourth,
fifth
level
down
below,
a
purchaser
of
signal
gasoline
somewhere
confronted
and
competed
with
a
purchaser
of
perkins
gasoline,
that
wouldn't
make
perkins
and
signal
a
competitors
or
competitors
for
the
purpose
of
this
act.
and
then
that
couldn't
--
that
wouldn't
mean
that
perkins
and
signal
competed
on
the
secondary
level
because
if
this
was
so
then
every
non-primary
line
case
would
have
to
be
a
secondary
line
case.
and
clearly,
this
is
what
--
it's
not
what
congress
meant.
congress
recognized
the
realities
of
the
market.
it
recognized
the
different
levels.
when
congress
talked
about
competition
with
the
grantor,
competition
with
the
favorite
purchaser,
competition
with
the
customer
of
the
favorite
purchaser
and
if
the
argument
is
accepted
just
because
somewhere
way
down
the
line,
there
are
people
who
compete
for
the
gasoline
derived
from
these
two
sources,
signal
and
perkins.
now,
that
means
that
perkins
and
signal
were
competing
at
the
secondary
line
then
this
elaborate
definitional
language
used
by
congress
would
be
entirely
superfluous.
congress
could
simply
have
forbidden
price
discriminations
whose
effect
may
be
“to
injure,
destroy
or
prevent
competition
with
any
person.”
but
congress
and
i
think
wisely
so
refrained
from
going
that
far
because
--
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
i
think
that
is
correct.
there
could
be
so
many
--
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
well,
i
could
think
there
could
be
so
many
intervening
factors
by
the
time
you
even
get
to
the
third
level
that
would
be
responsible
for
the
--
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
--
pricing.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
now,
there
are
just
one
or
two
other
points
i
would
like
to
cover
before
my
time
is
up
and
i
see
i
have
only
a
few
moments
left
and
that
is
this.
petitioner
asks
that
the
jury
verdict
be
reinstated.
we
suggest
that
that
should
not
be
done.
there
were
many
material
errors
the
trial
could
have
presented
to
the
court
of
appeals
which
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
rule
upon.
one
of
them
was
this
question
of
causality
and
that
question
of
causality
cuts
across
the
robinson-patman
act
standards
as
well
as
the
original
clayton
act
standard.
now,
in
addition
there
were
serious
and
important
questions
concerning
liability.
there
were
questions
concerning
the
fact
of
injury.
there
were
also
questions
concerning
the
good
faith
meeting
of
competition
defense.
some
of
these
questions
that
court
of
appeals
ruled
on
against
perkins,
others
it
reserved
the
ruling
but
admonished
that
its
failure
to
rule
was
not
to
be
taken
by
the
trial
court
as
appellate
approval.
now,
to
resolve
these
questions
would
require
a
review
of
this
vast
record
of
some
6000
pages
of
transcript
and
some
15,000
or
more
pages
of
exhibits
which
we
suggest
would
more
appropriately
be
left
in
the
first
instance
to
the
court
of
appeals.
i
have
one
more
point.
there
has
been
some
talked
about
regal
selling
at
a
loss,
mr.
justice
fortas.
regal
must
not
have
sold
at
a
loss
because
there
was
a
difference
between
five
and
six
cents
according
to
perkins'
testimony
between
the
price
that
regal
sold
and
the
price
that
perkins'
single
retail
station
in
vancouver
sold.
now,
this
difference
certainly
could
have
been
attributed
to
the
less
than
one-half
cent
price
differential
that
was
granted
in
signal
after
january.
and
again,
i
don't
think
we
can
assume
that
regal
would
sell
at
a
loss
because
i
don't
think
that
there
would
have
--
i
think
that
the
majority
stockholders
there
in
western
would
have
been
violating
their
obligations
to
the
minority
to
have
compelled
regal
to
sell.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
no,
your
honor.
there
was
no
evidence
in
the
record
of
the
price
that
regal
paid.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
i
do
not
know
why.
the
auditor
for
regal
was
on
the
stand.
he
was
also
the
auditor
for
western.
he
testified
as
to
what
western's
prices
were
for
the
invoices
in
but
he
was
not
asked
any
questions
by
the
petitioner
as
to
what
regal's
price
was
and
certainly
this
was
a
crucial
element
of
proof
that
was
available
to
petitioner
but
he
failed
to
comply.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
the
invoices
from
signal
to
western
are
in
the
record
but
not
from
western
to
regal.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
outset,
we
emphasize
that
this
is
not
case
of
predatory
or
widespread
discriminations
aimed
by
standard
at
eliminating
a
customer.
to
the
contrary,
in
the
1950's,
petitioners
and
some
four
or
five
other
jobbers
were
important
customers
of
standard
in
the
northwest.
these
jobbers
accounted
were
a
large
percentage
of
standard's
sales
in
that
area,
enabled
standard
to
gain
access
to
a
market,
it
could
not
otherwise
reach
and
this
was
a
market
comprise
of
people
who
thinks
they
don't
buy
major
brand
gasoline.
they
prefer
to
purchase
minor
brand
gasoline
from
the
local
dealer.
in
these
circumstances,
there
was
absolutely
no
commercial
risk
why
standard
should
wish
to
drive
whether
of
its
customers
in
the
market.
predatory
pricing
after
all
is
associated
with
the
marketer
who
attempts
to
enhance
his
position
in
the
market.
but
after
all
when
perkins
terminated
his
contract
with
standard,
it
was
union
oil
company
of
california
gasoline
that
was
sold
through
his
stations
not
standard's
and
certainly
that
was
not
a
situation
that
standard
sought
to
instigate.
and
similarly,
it
was
not
in
standard's
interest
to
instigate
widespread
price
loss
which
would
cost
the
company
vast
sums
of
money
by
way
of
prices
assistance
to
its
dealers.
this
case
involves
three
basic
claims.
one
is
the
discrimination
in
price
of
the
gasoline
to
signal.
two,
the
claim
discriminations
in
the
price
of
gasoline
to
standard's
branded
dealers;
and
three,
the
section
2
(e)
and
2
(d)
discriminations
in
favor
of
branded
--
of
standard's
branded
dealers.
now,
as
to
signal,
there
are
two
claims.
counsel
so
far
i
believe
it
mentioned
only
one.
it
was
the
claim
in
the
centralia-seattle
area
and
there
was
a
claim
in
portland-vancouver
area.
the
facts
are
that
in
1955,
signal
first
purchased
gasoline
from
standard
in
seattle.
there,
perkins
was
buying
gasoline
but
it
was
union's
gasoline
which
perkins
purchased
through
westway
and
perkins
competed
with
signal's
customers
harris
and
others
in
seattle
but
he
competed
with
westway
gasoline
or
union
gasoline
not
standard's
gasoline.
now,
some
80
miles
to
the
south
of
seattle
there's
a
small
town
in
centralia
and
there
perkins
had
a
customer
named
carter
and
it
was
claimed
that
signal
reached
out
to
one
of
its
wholesalers
and
took
this
customer
carter
away.
the
facts
are
that
neither
signal
nor
any
of
signal's
customers
ever
sold
any
gasoline
in
centralia.
now,
the
second
market
involving
signal
is
portland-vancouver.
signal
commenced
buying
from
standard,
in
portland
in
august
of
1956.
signal
resold
all
of
this
gasoline
to
western
hyway.
signal
by
the
way
had
absolutely
no
stock
with
ownership
connection
with
standard.
western
hyway
was
owned
60%
by
signal
and
the
remaining
of
the
stock
was
owned
by
western's
corporate
officers.
western
sold
all
of
this
gasoline
except
for
a
minor
amount
which
is
not
pertinent
to
this
lawsuit,
the
three
regal
stations
in
portland.
those
regal
stations
were
owned
55%
of
the
stock
by
western
and
the
remainder
by
persons
having
no
connection
with
western.
the
important
fact
is
that
when
regal
opened
the
business
in
portland
in
september,
signal
was
paying
standard
a
higher
price
for
gasoline
then
perkins
was
paying.
and
at
all
times
in
this
lawsuit
from
september
from
1956
until
june
of
1957
the
price
paid
by
western
hyway,
regal
supplier
the
gasoline
was
higher
than
the
price
paid
by
regal.
i
say
that
was
until
june
of
1957.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
the
price
paid
by
regal,
excuse
me,
when
i
said
that
i
misspoke
myself.
the
price
paid
by
western
hyway
regal
supplier
for
gasoline
was
higher
than
the
price
paid
by
perkins.
there
was
no
evidence
in
this
case
of
the
price
paid
by
regal.
after
november
1,
1957,
western's
price
was
some
35
ten-thousandths
of
a
cent
higher
than
the
price
paid
by
perkins.
so
the
summary
on
signal
is
that
signal
never
sold
to
a
retailer
and
signal
never
sold
through
its
wholesaler
or
directly
to
anyone
in
centralia.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
no.
the
situation
in
neither
market
was
not
true
mr.
justice
white.
the
situation
in
seattle
was
that
signal
sold
to
one
b.f.
harris,
a
jobber
the
same
as
perkins.
perkins
and
b.f.
harris
in
seattle
sought
the
business
of
one
carter
in
seattle.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
well
we
–-
technically,
we
would
call
them
jobbers
but
mr.
justice
there
are
(voice
overlap).
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
no,
signal,
we
would
not
call
a
jobber.
signal
was
an
integrated
oil
company.
it
was
more
on
the
level
of
standard
but
it
sold
wholesale
to
jobbers.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
yes,
it
sold
in
wholesale.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
perkins
sold
at
a
wholesale
level.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
no,
i
would
say
that
signal
and
perkins
was
not
in
competition.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
they
weren't
selling
the
same
customers
if
i
may
analyze
that
for
you.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
that
is
what
i'm
saying
and
i'd
like
to
go
to
seattle
market
--
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
no,
it's
not
in
this
circumstance.
we
go
to
take
portland
for
example,
signal
sold
only
to
western
in
portland.
now,
as
to
portland
--
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
--
perkins
had
by
agreement
in
contract
with
the
others
who
would
sign
standard
contract
with
them
precluded
himself
from
selling
gasoline
in
portland.
perkins
gave
the
portland
market
to
file
and
harass
his
cosigners
on
the
contract
with
standard.
secondly,
perkins
sold
to
distributors
such
as
his
nephew
in
vancouver
and
sold
to
dealers
who
would
tie
to
him
by
leases
or
to
dealers
where
he
owned
the
retail
stations.
and
so
there
was
narrow
any
competition
between
signal
and
perkins
for
the
business
of
western.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
you
know
generally
speaking,
--
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
no,
as
a
practical
matter,
perkins
could
not
have
taken
signal's
only
customer
in
portland
and
signal
had
only
one
customer
in
portland
and
that
was
western
hyway.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
as
matters
developed,
i
don't
know
the
record
doesn't
show
that
the
time
that
perkins
went
out
of
business,
signal
still
had
one
customer
in
portland
and
that
was
western
hyway
and
as
i
say
perkins
had
precluded
himself
from
seeking
that
business
by
contract
with
his
cosigners
under
standard
agreement.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
well,
i
say
that
they
are
not
in
direct
competition
for
the
same
business
in
the
same
place
and
the
same
time.
i
think
that's
the
definition
of
competition,
generally
accepted
under
robinson-patman.
now,
i
might
refer
to
this
court's
decision
in
fred
meyer.
there,
the
same
concept
of
competition
was
suggested.
fred
meyer,
as
the
court
will
recall,
involved
the
2
(d)
claim
of
discrimination.
the
manufacturer
sold
to
a
direct
buying
retailer
and
also
sold
to
a
wholesaler.
the
federal
trade
commission
suggested
and
argued
that
because
the
wholesaler
was
really
competing
for
the
same
customer's
dollars
as
the
retailer.
the
wholesaler
was
entitled
to
the
same
promotional
payments
as
the
retailer
was
getting.
but
this
court
rejected
that
concept
of
competition
and
said
specifically
that
despite
the
broader
term
distribution
used
in
section
2
(d)
which
is
broader
term
than
the
term
resale
in
2
(a),
the
congress
did
not
intend
the
word
“competition”
as
used
in
the
robinson-patman
act
would
have
that
broad
meaning.
going
to
the
seattle
market,
there,
signal
sold
to
jobbers
who
were
on
the
same
level
as
perkins
and
i've
mentioned
one
b.f.
harris
and
b.f.
harris
and
perkins
were
certainly
competing
for
the
same
business
but
signal
and
perkins
as
a
practical
factual
matter
as
the
record
shows
that
they
were
not.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
yes.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
well,
i
don't
believe,
my
--
our
position
here
of
course
that
perkins
did
not
suffer
any
damage
whatsoever
from
standard
sales
to
signal
switching
to
the
portland
market
and
to
follow
up
your
honor's
question.
there,
the
market
is
structured
this
way,
standard
sold
to
western,
standard
sold
to
signal,
signal
sold
to
western,
western
sold
to
regal
which
was
a
retail
outlet.
regal
did
in
fact
compete
with
some
of
the
stations
supplied
by
perkins
across
the
river
in
vancouver.
and
it
was
said
at
that
level
where
we
had
the
competition.
it
was
there
where
there
was
head
to
head
competition
for
the
dollars
of
the
same
customers.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
there
was
real
competition.
we
must
acknowledge
that
at
the
retail
level
and
our
whole
point
here
and
the
only
real
matter
decided
by
the
court
of
appeals
was
that
because
that
competition
which
perkins
asserted
injured
him
was
at
the
fourth
level
and
because
congress
did
not
extend
the
robinson-patman
amendments
down
to
that
fourth
level,
perkins
was
not
entitled
to
recover
here
for
any
injury
that
may
have
been
caused
to
him
by
regal
assuming
that
regal
did
cause
that
injury.
do
i
answer
your
question
mr.
justice?
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
well,
if
i
understand
your
honor's
question,
my
answer
would
be
this,
that
because
the
operating
people
making
the
operating
decisions
in
western,
making
the
price
in
business
in
western
owned
45%
of
the
stock
and
because
they
were
making
the
decision,
i
would
expect
these
decisions
to
be
as
much
in
the
interest
of
these
independents
as
it
would
in
signal.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
well,
60%
your
honor.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
western.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
55%
your
honor.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
or
the
facts
and
mr.
justice
fortas
i'd
like
to
pick
up
the
facts
on
that
situation.
first,
we
go
to
the
court
of
appeals'
finding
that
there
was
no
evidence
in
the
record
of
operational
control
and
then
we
look
at
the
invoices
from
signal
to
western
and
there's
all
every
invoice,
every
sale
representing
every
sale
from
signal
to
western
is
in
this
record.
they
are
summarized
at
page
22
of
our
brief
and
they
show
that
the
prices
to
western
were
higher
than
the
prices
of
standard
to
perkins.
and
so,
signal
in
other
words
took
that
price
differential
of
some
less
than
a
half
of
the
sale
which
would
receive
by
the
way
only
after
january
(voice
overlap)
to
put
in
his
pocket.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
yes,
but
i
don't
understand
how
that
could
happen
here
--
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
i
think
petitioner
who
puts
his
finger
right
on
it
in
his
brief
when
he
states
that
the
question
of
control,
mr.
justice
fortas,
is
a
question
of
fact.
now,
this
fact,
this
issue
control
was
never
passed
on
to
the
jury.
it
was
never
submitted
to
the
jury.
we
suggested
an
instruction
which
would
ask
the
jury
or
instruct
the
juries
that
one
of
the
issues
here
was
whether
or
not
this
price
differential
was
passed
on
and
the
court
refused
to
give
that
instruction.(voice
overlap)
so
the
jury
really
never
decided
this
question.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
well,
depending
on
whether
the
impact
there
would
probably
be
on
the
third
level
but
certainly
a
possibility
of
violation
of
2
(a)
depending
on
impact.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
of
course,
in
every
other
field
of
the
law
for
example,
in
creditor's
rights.
where
a
creditor
wishes
to
attack
the
separate
corporate
identities
of
two
corporations,
it
is
the
burden
on
the
creditor
to
show
that
there
is
an
alter
ego
situation
here
and
i
don't
see
why
the
situation
shouldn't
be
the
same
here.
so
far
as
the
back
--
that
signal
owned
a
part
of
western
and
that
western
owned
the
part
of
regal,
that
would
make
no
difference
whatsoever
if
there
was,
if
each
of
these
entities
did
operate
independently.
it
will
be
exactly
the
same
situation
as
standard
had
sold
to
signal
and
that
signal
had
sold
to
a
completely
different
independent
identity
and
in
turn
it
sold
to
a
completely
independent
identity.
the
only
question
is
the
question
of
fact,
this
petition
has
points
out
and
there
was
no
evidence
to
overcome
and
i
think
the
presumption
should
be
was
that
these
entities
were
truly
independent.
the
--
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
no,
i
think
but
the
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
--
there
was
no
evidence
on
it
and
they
left
that
open
for
retrial.
they
left
that
issue
open
for
retrial.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
that
is
correct.
i
agree
with
that.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
it
left
the
question
of
control
opened
and
specifically
stated
in
response
to
the
petition
rehearing
that
that
question
is
open
for
retrial.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
no,
they
couldn't
decide
it
because
there
was
no
evidence
on
the
question
of
control.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
that's
correct.
that's
precisely
the
only
holding
on
2
(a)
that
the
court
of
appeals
made.
now,
--
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
i
don't
believe
i
understand
your
honor's
question.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
certainly,
his
line
of
commerce
is
involved.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
yes.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
well,
i
entirely
agree
with
petitioner
that
had
this
case
been
submitted
to
the
court
of
appeals
under
the
original
language
of
the
clayton
act
and
why
is
that
--
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
well,
clearly
--
i
would
say
this,
i
agree
with
the
legal
proposition
that
the
original
language
of
the
clayton
act
has
no
limitations
in
so
far
as
level
is
concerned,
so
far
as
van
camp
is
concerned
that
case,
that
issue
was
decided
if
there
was
a
substantial
lessening
of
competition
on
any
level
--
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
--
why
that
case
that
that's
the
end
of
this
lawsuit.
now,
to
come
back
your
honor's
other
suggestion
that
it
was
submitted
to
the
jury,
i
don't
agree
with
petitioner's
point
of
view
on
that
at
all.
i
was
in
the
trial
of
the
case,
the
case
would
never
focus
on
a
general
lessening
of
competition
in
the
market.
it
is
perfectly
true
that
--
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
it
--
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
yes.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
yes.
competition
would
--
regal
was
lessened
and
perkins
himself
was
injured
rather
than
in
entire
market.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
well,
the
instruction
to
the
jury
did
focus
on
that
in
that,
it
named
very
specifically
to
the
competitors
of
perkins
who
would
be
regal,
signal,
western,
and
the
dealers.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
no,
there's
--
i
have
no
quarrel
with
petitioner
on
this
at
all.
it
appears
that
those
instructions
appears
at
page
54.
they
were
given
in
the
alternative,
the
jury
was
told
that
it
must
found
--
find
and
i'm
reading
at
second
line,
to
that
the
reasonable
probable
effect
of
the
discrimination
may
have
been
to
substantially
lessen
competition
and
then
in
the
disjunctive
or
tend
to
create
a
monopoly
in
the
line
of
commerce
or
--
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
--
then
robinson-patman
and
to
destroy
or
prevent
competition
with
perkins
of
oregon,
etcetera,
etcetera.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
there
was
no
evidence
that
signal
controlled
regal.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
there
is
a
majority
stock
ownership
mr.
justice.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
as
the
court
of
appeals
pointed
out
that
signal
was
in
the
position
to
control
western
and
that
western
was
in
the
position
to
control
regal.
but
there
were
no
interlocking
directors
and
there
was
no
demonstration
of
actual
control.
i'm
not
saying
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
the
offices
of
the
corporation
who
are
operating
the
corporation
control
the
corporation.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
they
are
elected
at
the
stockholders
meeting
and
speaking
yes.
but
i
think
it's
especially
significant
here
that
the
minority
stockholders
of
western
were
the
operating
officers
and
you
would
expect
them
as
they
did
often
rate
that
company
against
the
best
interest
of
signal
when
they
were
purchasing
gasoline
from
others
than
signal
and
deprive
signal
of
its
wholesale
profits
what
signal
should
grant.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
no.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
no.
no,
but
there
was
no
evidence
that
the
president
of
the
chairman
of
the
board
or
any
officer
of
signal
directed
the
pricing
decisions
of
western.
in
absence
of
that
kind
of
evidence,
you
would
expect
that
western's
pricing
decisions
will
be
independent.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
that
assumption
might
be
valid
mr.
justice
douglas
but
here
in
this
case
we
had
quarrels
between
the
owners
of
signal,
the
majority
owners
of
western
and
the
signal
operating
officers
as
to
where
they
would
buy
their
gasoline
and
western
insisted
that
they
have
buy
their
gasoline
wherever
they
could
get
the
cheaper
price
even
though
this
deprive
its
parent
of
its
wholesale
profits.
and
that
would
indicate
to
me
a
lack
of
control.
now,
they
say
before,
i'm
not
assuming
for
a
moment
or
suggesting
for
a
moment
as
the
court
of
appeals
pointed
out
signal
was
in
a
position
to
control
but
there
was
no
evidence
that
it
did
and
--
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
were
in
control.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
yes,
whether
it
was
purchased
from
signal
or
wherever
else
they
could
get
it,
fortunately.
they
were
certainly
weren't
going
to
operate
that
company
so
as
to
advantage
the
minority
of
the
majority
ownership
in
signal
if
they
could
avoid
it
and
they
did
avoid
it.
going
back
to
my
argument
is
that,
we
have
no
disagreement
here
that
the
original
language
of
the
clayton
act
extends
to
all
levels
of
competition.
our
point
here
is
that
this
standard
was
presented
to
the
jury
in
the
alternative.
certainly,
the
standard
of
the
robinson-patman
act
provisions
was
more
or
less
onerous
burden
in
the
standard
of
the
original
clayton
act
and
one
would
expect
that
the
--
having
a
choice
the
jury
would
make
the
decision
in
--
on
a
basis
of
the
--
or
simplified
unless
onerous
robinson-patman
amendments.
but
before
the
court
of
appeals,
our
objection
here
to
raising
this
problem
here
is
not
a
technical
one.
the
matter
was
not
presented
to
the
court
of
appeals.
it
was
not
briefed
to
the
court
of
appeals.
the
court
of
appeals
never
had
an
opportunity
to
define
this
market
either
on
a
functional
basis
or
on
geographical
basis.
there
are
other
jobbers
in
the
northwest
supplied
by
competitors
of
standard.
there
was
no
showing
of
the
impact
of
signal's
operations
of
these
other
jobbers
or
on
the
retail
outlets
of
the
other
jobbers.
the
only
showing
of
an
impact
at
all
or
an
adverse
effect
of
all
was
on
the
competitor
perkins
and
that's
the
limit
of
the
finding
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
its
footnote
6.
so,
i
don't
disagree
with
the
proposition
of
law
but
my
only
suggestion
is
that
this
court
has
before
it
the
abstract
question
of
whether
or
not
the
standard
of
the
original
clayton
act
is
limited
to
the
fourth
level
or
to
the
third
level
or
to
the
second
level.
the
answer
to
that
is
no,
van
camp
settled
that
and
there
isn't
a
record
here
that
would
support
a
holding
that
the
original
clayton
act
should
apply
here
in
this
case.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
yes
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
think
you
would.
i
don't
think
there's
a
matter
of
degree
of
control.
i
think
petitioner
has
put
his
finger
right
on
the
question.
it's
a
question
of
fact
in
every
case.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
yes.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
and
that's
where
i'm
in
agreement
with
them
at
least
on
that
--
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
otherwise,
we
would
get
in
there.
it
seems
to
me
the
rule
would
be
so
vague
whether
it
would
be
30%
control,
50%
control,
75%
control
and
despite
these
percentages
the
factual
situation
may
vary
on
each
one
of
this.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
well,
it
probably
--
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
one
other
aspect
to
the
fourth
level
point
that
we
have
here.
there
is
no
question
at
all
that
the
plain
language
of
the
robinson-patman
amendments
limits
the
impact
to
the
third
level.
it
declares
a
price
discrimination,
a
violation
of
law
if
there
is
a
lessening
of
competition
with
the
grantor,
a
lessening
of
competition,
a
second
level
of
the
recipient
or
thirdly,
a
lessening
of
competition
at
the
third
level
with
the
favored
buyer
of
the
recipient
in
this
case
western.
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
limits
it
to
that
level,
this
court
held
in
standard
oil,
congress
knew
very
well
how
to
designate
the
levels
of
competition
which
intended
to
protect.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
no,
i
do
not
think
it
is
the
same
standard.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
two
reasons.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
it
certainly
would
and
(voice
overlap).
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
correct.
then,
it
would
have
to
be
a
general
depression
and
lessening
of
competition
in
the
market
generally.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
and
there
was
no
evidence
of
such
an
effect
in
this
case.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
generally.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
i
think
that's
correct.
yes,
your
honor
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
i
would
have
to
say
to
the
general
question
no
mr.
justice
but
let
me
make
sure
that
i
understand
the
question.
i
think
it's
--
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
yes.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
well,
first,
let
me
answer
it
this
way,
going
and
i'll
get
to
your
specific
question,
going
to
the
broader
antitrust
policy
i
do
not
believe
that
the
broader
antitrust
policy
under
the
sherman
act
would
want
to
prohibit
price
discriminations
in
all
situations.
i
think
or
rigidified
by
price
but
within
that
broad
policy,
certainly,
i
think
it
is
a
purpose
of
the
robinson-patman
act
and
section
2
of
the
clayton
act
to
put
competitors
generally
on
the
same
pricing
level.
yes,
so
that
they
can
start
off
at
an
equal
start
and
congress
in
order
to
accommodate
itself
to
the
broader
general,
the
broader
view
of
the
law
that
should
have
competitive
pricing
and
bargaining
on
pricing
restricted
the
reach
of
robinson-patman
so
that
it
declared
a
price
difference,
price
differential,
unlawful
only
where
there
was
a
lessening
of
competition
that
one
of
these
three
levels.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
yes.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
i
have
no
problem
with
that
at
all
your
honor.
i
think
that
that
would
be
a
situation
that
would
be
a
violation
of
robinson-patman
act.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
and
i
think
as
i
mentioned
--
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
i
say
that
that
was
not
shown
and
that
was
not
the
situation
here
and
in
fact
the
evidence
intended
to
show
just
the
other
way.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
i
think
it
did,
yes.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
well,
the
problem
here
mr.
justice
white
was
--
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
yes.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
no,
that
is
correct.
but
--
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
no,
i
don't
think
that
the
jury
understood
this
problem.
we
had
--
we
have
asked
the
court
at
the
trial
level
to
submit
to
the
jury
the
question
whether
the
price
differential
as
small
as
it
was,
was
passed
down
to
regal.
the
court
refused
to
give
that
instruction.
the
court
instructed
the
jury
contrary
to
our
request
that
perkins
and
signal
were
competitors
and
i
think
what
the
jury
did
was
to
take
that
instruction
assumed
that
perkins
was
injured
and
assumed
it
was
injured
as
a
result
of
the
price
to
signal.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
i
think
under
that
erroneous
instruction
it
very
well
could
have.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
which
i
say
was
non-existing
and
certainly
wasn't
proved.
i
see
the
--
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
we'll
recess
now.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i'd
like
to
return
for
a
moment
to
the
question
mr.
justice
douglas
asked
yesterday
and
the
suggestion
that
there
must
have
been
a
control
by
western
over
regal
because
of
western's
55%
stock
interest
in
regal
and
my
response
to
mr.
justice
douglas'
question
was
that
although
western
was
in
a
position
to
control
regal,
there
was
no
evidence
that
there
was
in
fact
control.
i'd
like
to
add
and
answer
to
this
morning
and
say
that
i
think
it
will
be
recognized
that
western
as
a
majority
stockholder
in
regal
had
an
obligation
to
the
minority
stockholders
in
regal
and
it
was
western's
obligation
as
a
majority
stockholder
to
honor
its
obligations
to
the
minority
and
to
see
that
regal
could
resell
its
gasoline
at
a
price
that
would
return
to
regal
a
normal
profit.
in
other
words,
that
the
majority
in
western
had
an
obligation
to
refrain
from
dealing
with
regal
and
controlling
regal
to
the
point
that
regal
would
operate
at
a
loss.
now,
the
fact
is
that
western
paid
signal
slightly
higher
or
approximately
the
same
prices
towards
gasoline
that
perkins
paid
standard.
now,
signal
owned
a
majority
interest
in
western
and
was
obligated
to
treat
the
minority
interest
in
western
fairly
and
to
refrain
from
compelling
western
to
operate
at
a
loss,
or
to
sell
at
a
loss
to
regal.
beyond
this,
the
fact
of
the
matter
was
that
the
minority
stockholders
in
western
were
actually
the
controlling
officers
and
control
the
operations
of
western
and
they
were
in
a
very
good
position
to
see
that
their
own
interests
were
properly
taken
care
of.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
it
certainly
does,
yes.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
no,
i
do
not
believe
so,
--
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
--
your
honor.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
yes,
they
did.
i'd
like
to
step
back
a
moment
and
say
this
that
the
respondents
asked
that
this
question
of
passing
on
be
put
to
the
jury.
the
court
refused
to
do
that
and
i
might
say
there
that
on
page
5
of
our
brief,
--
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
no.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
i
think
that's
correct.
and
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
there's
no
dispute
between
petitioners
and
respondents
as
to
the
price
that
western
paid
for
its
gasoline.
that
evidence
was
put
in
on
the
basis
of
invoices.
the
invoices
of
signal
oil
and
gas
to
western
and
there
was
no
conflict
in
it
and
that
that
evidence,
that
invoice
evidence
is
summarize
in
the
footnote
at
page
22
of
our
brief.
and
it
shows
that
for
virtually
all
of
the
time,
western
paid
a
higher
price
for
gasoline
than
perkins.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
well,
that's
--
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
now,
that
--
that
i
think
goes
to
the
very
question
in
the
policy
question
as
to
why
congress
cut
this
liability
off
at
the
third
level.
regal
as
established
in
the
evidence
had
very
large
well-situated
stations.
they
concentrated
on
the
sale
of
gasoline.
they
concentrated
on
large
volume
stations.
they
open
with
the
well-advertised
campaign
and
it
was
perkins
own
marketing
experts,
it
wasn't
the
professor,
or
somebody,
theoretician.
he
had
actually
worked
for
years
in
the
portland
market.
he
was
an
independent
this
time
and
he
testified
that
he
was
in
portland
then,
and
he
said
it
wasn't
the
prices
of
regal
that
had
the
impact.
the
real
impact
of
regal
was
on
its
tremendous
advertising
campaign,
its
promotional
campaign
and
its
method
of
selling
of
a
gasoline.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
no.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
i
think
we
have
to
accept
for
the
purpose
of
this
record
here
that
there
was
a
reduction
in
the
price
in
portland
of
some
four
cents
immediately
after
regal
came
on
the
market.
but
mr.
justice
white,
we
could
not
attribute
that
four-cent
reduction
in
the
portland
market
to
the
less
than
half
cent
advantage
that
signal
had
over
perkins
and
at
the
very
time
that
regal
opened,
perkins
was
paying
a
higher
price,
and
signal
was
paying
a
higher
price
than
perkins.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
there
is
no
direct
evidence
in
this
record
as
to
what
regal
was
paid
except
the
ordinary
interest
and
i
think
it
should
be
drawn
that
western
paid
a
higher
price
than
perkins
and
we
can
assume
the
western
is
going
to
sell
to
regal
a
loss.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
yes,
that
is
what
i'm
suggesting
and
i'm
suggesting
also
that
because
of
regal's
more
efficient
operation,
regal
was
probably
taking
a
lower
profit
than
these
other
marketers.
they
were
probably
operating
on
a
large
volume
and
low
unit
cost.
and
there
also,
regal
did
not
perform
the
ordinary
regular
services
that
you
connect
with
service
stations
such
as
the
lubrication
and
repairs
and
that
sort
of
thing.
they
very
efficiently
concentrated
on
the
sale
of
gasoline.
that
was
the
testimony
of
petitioners
and
witnesses.
and
i
think
a
lot
of
it
could
be
attributed
to
that.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
you're
absolutely
correct,
--
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
--
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
you're
absolutely
correct,
of
course.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
i
would
have
to
answer
that
mr.
justice
fortas
in
this
way,
without
more,
the
answer
would
be
no.
i
still
think
it
would
take
a
factual
inquiry
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
was
actual
direction
by
signal
of
the
decisions
of
western
and
by
western
on
the
decisions
of
regal.
i
don't
think
the
inquiry
of
the
burden
would
be
nearly
as
strong
or
as
heavy
as
it
is
in
this
situation.
but
of
course
that
is
not
the
situation
that
we
got
here.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
i'd
like
to
go
one
step
further
than
that.
i
believe
it
is
the
presumption
in
virtually
every
deal
of
the
law
that
where
there
are
separate
entities,
these
separate
entities
make
their
own
decisions
but
i
recognize
that
whether
it's
a
100%
control,
the
burden
of
showing
the
contrary
is
not
nearly
the
burden
that
the
petitioner
would
have
here.
we
also
have
this
further
problem
which
i
was
going
to
mention
mr.
justice
fortas,
that
where
signal
is
holding
itself
out
as
an
independent
corporation,
where
western
is
holding
itself
out
as
an
independent
corporation,
where
regal
is
holding
itself
out
as
an
independent
corporation.
if
there
was
actual
price
control
down
the
line,
i
think
there
will
be
a
serious
danger
of
violation
of
the
sherman
act
and
i
don't
think
such
a
serious
violation
of
the
law
can
be
lightly
inferred
just
on
the
matter
of
this
control
--
of
stock
control.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
well,
that
brings
me
--
i
think
it
is
relevant
and
i
think
it
brings
me
to
--
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
well,
it
would
here.
i'll
put
it
this
way,
if
the
ultimate
seller
was
western
hyway
on
the
third
level,
then
control
makes
no
difference
at
all
but
even
if
this
price
differential
had
been
passed
on
all
the
way
down
to
regal
at
the
fourth
level,
then
i
say
that
that
is
beyond
the
purview
of
robinson-patman.
mr.
justice
white,
that
brings
me
to
the
--
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
unless
you
view
it
as
a
line
of
commerce
case
as
we
acknowledged
yesterday
and
that
brings
me
to
a
further
answer
perhaps
to
the
questions
you
asked
yesterday
and
that
was
this
question
that
the
original
language
of
the
clayton
act
decide.
we're
not
signal
and
perkins'
competitors
on
the
secondary
level.
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
that
within
the
meaning
of
the
language
of
the
robinson-patman
act,
the
answer
must
be
no.
the
first
answer
is
that
robinson-patman
uses
the
word
competition
in
its
practical
sense.
that
means
as
an
endeavor
by
two
or
more
persons
to
get
the
same
trade
from
the
same
people
at
the
same
place
at
the
same
time.
now,
the
evidence
is
--
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
well,
i'm
certain
that
perkins
was
competing
with
somebody,
yes.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
well,
let
me
answer
that
--
let
me
respond
to
that
this
way.
just
because
somewhere
down
the
line,
a
purchaser
of
signal
gasoline
may
be
third,
fourth,
fifth
level
down
below,
a
purchaser
of
signal
gasoline
somewhere
confronted
and
competed
with
a
purchaser
of
perkins
gasoline,
that
wouldn't
make
perkins
and
signal
a
competitors
or
competitors
for
the
purpose
of
this
act.
and
then
that
couldn't
--
that
wouldn't
mean
that
perkins
and
signal
competed
on
the
secondary
level
because
if
this
was
so
then
every
non-primary
line
case
would
have
to
be
a
secondary
line
case.
and
clearly,
this
is
what
--
it's
not
what
congress
meant.
congress
recognized
the
realities
of
the
market.
it
recognized
the
different
levels.
when
congress
talked
about
competition
with
the
grantor,
competition
with
the
favorite
purchaser,
competition
with
the
customer
of
the
favorite
purchaser
and
if
the
argument
is
accepted
just
because
somewhere
way
down
the
line,
there
are
people
who
compete
for
the
gasoline
derived
from
these
two
sources,
signal
and
perkins.
now,
that
means
that
perkins
and
signal
were
competing
at
the
secondary
line
then
this
elaborate
definitional
language
used
by
congress
would
be
entirely
superfluous.
congress
could
simply
have
forbidden
price
discriminations
whose
effect
may
be
“to
injure,
destroy
or
prevent
competition
with
any
person.”
but
congress
and
i
think
wisely
so
refrained
from
going
that
far
because
--
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
i
think
that
is
correct.
there
could
be
so
many
--
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
well,
i
could
think
there
could
be
so
many
intervening
factors
by
the
time
you
even
get
to
the
third
level
that
would
be
responsible
for
the
--
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
--
pricing.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
now,
there
are
just
one
or
two
other
points
i
would
like
to
cover
before
my
time
is
up
and
i
see
i
have
only
a
few
moments
left
and
that
is
this.
petitioner
asks
that
the
jury
verdict
be
reinstated.
we
suggest
that
that
should
not
be
done.
there
were
many
material
errors
the
trial
could
have
presented
to
the
court
of
appeals
which
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
rule
upon.
one
of
them
was
this
question
of
causality
and
that
question
of
causality
cuts
across
the
robinson-patman
act
standards
as
well
as
the
original
clayton
act
standard.
now,
in
addition
there
were
serious
and
important
questions
concerning
liability.
there
were
questions
concerning
the
fact
of
injury.
there
were
also
questions
concerning
the
good
faith
meeting
of
competition
defense.
some
of
these
questions
that
court
of
appeals
ruled
on
against
perkins,
others
it
reserved
the
ruling
but
admonished
that
its
failure
to
rule
was
not
to
be
taken
by
the
trial
court
as
appellate
approval.
now,
to
resolve
these
questions
would
require
a
review
of
this
vast
record
of
some
6000
pages
of
transcript
and
some
15,000
or
more
pages
of
exhibits
which
we
suggest
would
more
appropriately
be
left
in
the
first
instance
to
the
court
of
appeals.
i
have
one
more
point.
there
has
been
some
talked
about
regal
selling
at
a
loss,
mr.
justice
fortas.
regal
must
not
have
sold
at
a
loss
because
there
was
a
difference
between
five
and
six
cents
according
to
perkins'
testimony
between
the
price
that
regal
sold
and
the
price
that
perkins'
single
retail
station
in
vancouver
sold.
now,
this
difference
certainly
could
have
been
attributed
to
the
less
than
one-half
cent
price
differential
that
was
granted
in
signal
after
january.
and
again,
i
don't
think
we
can
assume
that
regal
would
sell
at
a
loss
because
i
don't
think
that
there
would
have
--
i
think
that
the
majority
stockholders
there
in
western
would
have
been
violating
their
obligations
to
the
minority
to
have
compelled
regal
to
sell.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
no,
your
honor.
there
was
no
evidence
in
the
record
of
the
price
that
regal
paid.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
i
do
not
know
why.
the
auditor
for
regal
was
on
the
stand.
he
was
also
the
auditor
for
western.
he
testified
as
to
what
western's
prices
were
for
the
invoices
in
but
he
was
not
asked
any
questions
by
the
petitioner
as
to
what
regal's
price
was
and
certainly
this
was
a
crucial
element
of
proof
that
was
available
to
petitioner
but
he
failed
to
comply.
mr.
richard
j.
maclaury
the
invoices
from
signal
to
western
are
in
the
record
but
not
from
western
to
regal.
