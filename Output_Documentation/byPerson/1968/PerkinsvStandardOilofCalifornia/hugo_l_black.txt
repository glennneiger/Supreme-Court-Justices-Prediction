justice

l.
black
may
i
ask
you
on
--
i'm
a
little
confused
by
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
your
statements
here?
this
lawsuit
seems
to
be
on
the
basis
that
some
how
standard
is
selling
to
signal
or
someone
else
who
competes
--
with
the
perkins
or
who
competes
with
somebody
that
standard
has
written
to
sold
the
order
so
it
did
suffer
damages.
i
don't
get
it
from
you
how
they
would
suffer
in
to
damages
at
all
as
counselor,
is
that
your
idea?
justice
hugo
l.
black
there
was
real
competition
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
a
question?
i'm
still
little
confused
about
all
these
levels,
but
i
would
like
to
know
suppose
evidence
had
shown,
i
don't
know
what
it
shown
that
standard
was
selling
any
line
which
carried
this
through
a
challenge
that
would
reach
perkins
and
put
him
out
of
business
because
of
the
prices
of
standard
was
knowing
to
sell
it
and
standard
knew
that
it
would
do
that,
would
that
violate
the
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i
tell
you
as
what
i'm
thinking
about.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
think
it
may
be
a
little
plain.
it's
not
so
much
how
business
institutionalizes
itself
or
what
names
it
give
as
i
understand
antitrust
law
was
constructed
for
the
purpose
of
providing
that
a
company
should
not
sell
to
one
company
cheaper
than
to
sold
its
competitors.
now,
suppose
it's
not
the
actual
competitive,
it
is
one
in
the
line
of
business
arrangement
that
have
been
set
up
which
accomplish
precisely
the
same
in
five
years
and
would
put
perkins
out
of
business,
suppose
he
did
this?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now
suppose
however,
that
there
was
a
business
who
couldn't
try
much
arranged,
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
where
there
was
really
no
business
difference
between
the
levels
and
it
were
just
simply
the
same
as
the
company
was
selling
right
straight
through
without
any
levels,
what
about
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
what
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
you
say
that
that
was
not
shown?
justice
hugo

what
was
that
evidence?
justice

what
was
that
evidence?

the
