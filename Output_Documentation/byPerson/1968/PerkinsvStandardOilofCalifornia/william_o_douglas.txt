justice
william

how
naïve
do
you
want
us
to
be?
there's
a
majority
stock
ownership
isn't
there
in
these
companies?
justice
william

what
would
you
want
to
--
what
standard
would
you
have
for
control?
we've
had
cases
here
for
1%
of
stock
ownership
that
has
been
tantamount
to
control.

it
comes
to
me
a
person
who
is
not
entirely
ignorant
of
the
corporate
seal
that
majority
stock
does
not
control.
perhaps
that
could
be
shown
by
in
some
way
that
majority
stock
does
not
control,
wasn't
under
any
trust
though?

i
would

things
go
along
