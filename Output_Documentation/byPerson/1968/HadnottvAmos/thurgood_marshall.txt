justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
redden,
in
alabama
do
the
candidates
for
elector
run
a
campaign
that
cost
money?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes,
sir.
justice
thurgood
marshall
or
i
mean
or
is
it
the
--
i'm
talking
about
just
for
their
one
position
as
one
of
the
electors.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
mean,
but
there's
no
question
that
corrupt
practices
act
will
blend.
it
does
apply
to
a
candidate
to
be
an
elector?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
redden,
didn't
the
secretary
of
state
take
that
out
of
this
case?
i
understood
the
secretary
state
challenged
the
fact
that
they'd
had
a
mass
meeting
and
then
we
can't
--
didn't
change
their
mind.
is
that
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
then
it
is
out
of
this
case.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
morgan,
what
worries
me
is
that
five
days
after
this
september
date,
you
didn't
file
but
you
did
file
after
that.
now
if
you
going
to
file,
why
didn't
you
file
within
the
five
days,
the
september
5
date?
that
problem
worries
me.
justice
thurgood
marshall
excuse
me,
mr.
morgan,
but
where
is
our
order?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
one
you're
talking
about,
the
order
that
this
court
issued.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i'm
sure
it's
here.
i
just
can't
find
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
have
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
did
these
regular
candidates
file
anything
after
the
“mass
meeting”?
did
they
file
any
designation
after
the
mass
meeting?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
weren't
they
--
doesn't
the
law
require
that
once
they
become
the
nominee
they
have
to
file
something?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
all?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
about
the
--
the
other
candidates
didn't
file
that
either.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
i'm
--
i
understood
the
point
was
that
the
original
papers
that
were
filed
were
different
simply
because
one
group
won
and
the
other
group
lost.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
i
understand
that
there's
no
difference,
under
alabama
law,
between
a
primary
election
and
a
mass
meeting.
justice
thurgood
marshall
then,
i
understand
your
position
to
be
that,
in
this
case,
two
things
were
held
the
same
day,
a
primary
election
and
a
mass
meeting.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
do
you
say?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
what
they
say?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
the
other
side
is
relying
--
the
regular
party
is
relying
on
the
primary
and
the
appellants
say
that
this
was
not
only
a
primary.
it
was
also
within
the
alabama
law
in
mass
meeting.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
say
there's
nothing
in
the
alabama
case
in
one
way
or
the
other.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
will
happen
on
the
same
day?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
didn't
she
also
say
that
she
had,
one
time,
accepted
these,
the
very
ones
involved?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how
does
that
fit
in
with
the
fact
that
she
never
does
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
about
the
government's
argument
that
this
was
all
an
afterthought?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
hubbard.
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
received
the
original
restraining
order.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and,
did
the
story
that
he
read
in
the
newspaper
not
say
that
this
court
had
reinstated
that
very
order
which
he
had
a
copy
of?
justice
thurgood
marshall
of
the
order?
justice
thurgood
marshall
which
he
already
has.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
there's
nothing
in
there
to
show
that
he
tried
to
find
out
for
certain,
one
way
or
the
other?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
shown
in
the
record?
is
the
history
of
that
man
shown
in
the
record?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
shows
what?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
nobody
disputed
their
right
at
that
time,
did
they?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
that's
a
little
different
from
october.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but,
you
say
that
the
whole
reason
for
his
ignorance
of
the
order
was
somebody
else's
and
i
say
i
think
you
are
admitting
the
fact
that
he
could've
found
out
himself.
after
all,
he
was
a
lawyer.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but,
it's
not
clear
in
the
laws
about
them,
is
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
law
of
alabama
says
specifically,
does
it
not,
that
states
goes
to
the
secretary
and
local
goes
to
the
probate
judge?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
are
you
going
to
put
practice
over
the
law?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
don't
we
have
to
follow
the
construction
of
the
laws
of
alabama
as
well
as
we
do
in
any
other
state?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
far
as
i'm
concerned,
i
would
love
to
hear
you
discuss
this
case
and
judge
herndon's
actions
in
this
case.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
--
then
you
can
file
them
either
place.
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
the
probate
judge.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
your
position
limited
to
the
fact
that
because
the
secretary
of
state
said
there's
no
use
in
you
filing
before
the
probate
judge
that
excused
you
from
not
filing
before
the
probate
judge?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
one
of
them,
isn't
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
was
thinking
about
asking
you
the
case
that
said
just
about
that
because
the
law
is
only
applied
once,
that
that's
discriminatory.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
your
only
precedent
is
the
dissenting
opinion
in
this
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
judge
johnson
is
a
good
judge.
i
mean
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
redden,
in
alabama
do
the
candidates
for

run
a
campaign
that
cost

justice
