unknown
speaker
he
said
that?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
mr.
morgan
--
unknown
speaker
so
your
trusted
ballot
is
subject
to
bargaining,
is
there
any
usual
in
this
case
where
everything
about
this
ballot
are
standard
are
back
with
these
procedures
which
requires
you
to
under
section
5?
unknown
speaker
you're
making
an
argument.
unknown
speaker
going
back
at
some
points.
unknown
speaker
what
was
the
form
of
order,
the
interim
where
you
initially
got
on
the
three-judge
court?
unknown
speaker
that
has
happen
evidently.
what
does
that
suppose
to
mean
on
this
ballot
that
is
not
there
now?
unknown
speaker
the
way
that
it
is?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
you
were
entitled
a
list
the
result
of
the
shifting
in
column
1,
electors
are
going
to
be
column
7.
what
would
this
mean
if
you
only
(inaudible)?
unknown
speaker
no
but
i
think
you
it
would
not
have
to
be
done?
unknown
speaker
if
that's
the
way
she
wanted,
then
you
will
get
it.
is
that
the
kind
of
change
that
will
have
to
be
made?
unknown
speaker
oh,
what
happened
if
we
were
to
putting
you
on
the
ballot
sheets,
are
there
any
printed
ballots?
unknown
speaker
well,
so
it's
either
new
ballots
or
for
the
first
time,
if
you
prevail,
ballots
were
shift
from
the
column
1
electors
going
to
column
7?
unknown
speaker
well,
does
that
mean
ballots
if
it
just
waited
separates
up
to
the
elector
then
of
course
the
humphrey-muskie
ticket
whether
this
is
(inaudible)?
unknown
speaker
but
you
can't
aggravate
the
both
--
unknown
speaker
we
need
to
base
it
--
unknown
speaker
they'll
be
able
to
vote
a
straight
party.
i'm
speaking
of
maximum.
unknown
speaker
four
years
only
of
the
party
you
represent.
really
what
they
want
that
they
are
supposed
to
be
able
to
vote
straight
party?
unknown
speaker
but
frankly
whether
they're
electors?
unknown
speaker
what's
the
substance?
unknown
speaker
of
the
office
of
the
vice
--
of
the
vice-president
before
march
1.
unknown
speaker
well
may
i
ask
you
this
way,
what
was
the
declaration
of
the
part
of
republican
party
before
march
1?
unknown
speaker
to
what?
unknown
speaker
they
don't
have
to
identify
the
candidates
that
they
are
going
to
support.
unknown
speaker
obviously
not
to
support
them.
unknown
speaker
that's
not
the
total
ballot
up
there?
unknown
speaker
if
you
want
to
run
about
a
hundred
candidates,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
alright,
89
and
of
those
10
are
electors
and
the
rest
are
for
various
state
and
local
offices?
unknown
speaker
and
as
matters
now
stand,
none
of
those
is
on
the
ballot?
unknown
speaker
i
understand.
unknown
speaker
under
what
party
emblem?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
as
matters
now
stand
absent
to
this
court's
order,
the
national
democratic
party
of
alabama
emblem
will
appear
on
the
ballot
and
then
there
will
be
only
two
candidates.
unknown
speaker
well
is
that
the
--
where
those
the
only
two
reasons
that
the
secretary
of
state
gave
to
--
unknown
speaker
well,
now
the
garrett
law,
i
guess
you
apparently
have
an
idea
of
what
the
garrett
law
isn't
even
in
effect,
don't
you?
unknown
speaker
and
you
don't
get
to
its
constitutionality
unless
a
law
is
--
unknown
speaker
well
is
it
the
same
issue
that's
here
in
this
whitley
case
or?
unknown
speaker
but
one
of
those
cases
we
heard
yesterday.
unknown
speaker
is
this
the
same
law
that's
in
--
that's
at
issue
in
--
no
that's
a
mississippi
case?
unknown
speaker
i
understood,
they
haven't
asked
for
the
garrett
law.
unknown
speaker
that's
passed
in
1967?
unknown
speaker
now
as
the
--
has
the
additional
reason
that
the
secretary
of
the
state
has,
the
court
practices
law
disqualification
and
it
was
that
presented
to
the
district
court?
that
was
presented
in
the
court
after
we
were
in
the
court.
let
me
give
you
the
sequence
of
that
as
rapidly
as
i
can.
we're
in
court
--
we're
in
court
in
the
13th,
we
know
we
are
not
candidates.
now
the
law
said
that
we
have
to
postmark
our
corrupt
practice
statements
five
days
after
the
date
of
filing
of
the
--
certificate
of
mass
meeting.
september
5th
comes,
september
10th
she
announces
publicly
in
the
press
that
we
are
not
candidates.
now
i
don't
know
that
there's
anything
that
we
have
to
do
beyond
that
such
as
file
at
notice
when
the
secretary
of
state
says,
that
you
on
the
ballot.
we
say
she
first
told
the
period.
then
secondly,
we
went
back
in
the
district
court
and
what
happens
at
that
point
is,
the
district
court
on
the
16th
as
i
recall
it
held
the
hearing.
he
said
it
would
issue
the
order,
get
your
candidate
straight.
on
the
17th
for
the
first
time,
the
state
attorney
general
comes
along
and
says
“none
of
your
candidates
have
signed
these
declarations.”
now
30
to
35
did
it
because
they
did
file
garrett
law
implications
regardless
what
the
--
you
know,
what's
been
stated,
they
just
filed.
and
they
are
contained
on
the
same
form.
that's
why
everybody
else
filed
them
because
you
know,
the
form
was
made
out
that
way.
well
what
happens
then
is
we're
in
open
court,
they
then
raised
that
question
and
say
none
of
your
candidates
could
appear
and
we
look
up
and
we
say,
“okay,
we
are
not
candidates
to
the
district
court
and
of
the
temporary
restraining
order.
no
matter
what
you
say,
we
couldn't
have
been.”
we
immediately
filed
in
the
court
a
certificate
of
compliance
and
as
judge
johnson
says,
and
it's
not
our
phrase
it's
the
dissenting
judge
johnson's
phrase,
they're
disqualified
in
this
whole
slate
by
an
afterthought.
and
they're
doing
it
in
federal
court
by
a
document
filed
in
federal
court.
she
started
with
two
reasons.
she
lost
on
one
of
those,
now
she
has
two
new
--
one
new
reason.
and
she's
applying
the
corrupt
practices
act
and
it
looks
does
like
it's
clearly
equal
situation
because
it's
never
been
enforced
by
the
state.
unknown
speaker
what
did
the
court
do
about
it?
unknown
speaker
was
there
evidence
to
the
effect
that
the
state
had
never
enforced
that
law
to
court?
unknown
speaker
what
page?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
this
mr.
redden?
unknown
speaker
if
we
did
not
have
the
garrett
law
at
all,
alabama
has
not
adopted,
do
i
understand
you
to
say
by
may
7,
either
party
must
on
that
day
decide
on
convention
and
then
turn
up
with
nominees
within
60
days
before
elections,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
certify
them.
unknown
speaker
and
if
one
is
an
independent,
what
does
he
do?
unknown
speaker
the
same?
unknown
speaker
but
--
so
if
we
did
not
have
the
garrett
law
act
that
would
be
the
procedure?
unknown
speaker
and
now
may
i
ask
if
it
pleases,
did
this
party,
the
appellants
here,
what
do
they
do
before
they
set
to
run,
anything?
unknown
speaker
what's
the
date
of
that
law?
unknown
speaker
what's
the
date
of
that
law?
unknown
speaker
is
any
law
here
other
than
the
one
we
just
talked
about,
that's
1967?
unknown
speaker
that's
the
only
one.
all
the
other
laws
we're
talking
about
are
predate
1966.
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
say
about
the
carried
garrett
law
as
to
whether
or
not
it's
in
effect
or
not?
unknown
speaker
the
language
is
section
5,
is
it
mr.
redden?
the
language
of
section
5
is
whether
it's
a
standard
practice
of
procedure
not
whether
it's
a
device.
unknown
speaker
well
that
brings
me
back
to
what
i
was
asking
you
earlier.
if
we
felt
that
this
fell
--
that
the
garrett
act
fell
within
the
requirements
of
section
5
and
therefore
is
--
was
not
a
law.
so
that
what
then
was
required
as
compliance
with
whatever
law,
other
law
has
bear
on
the
section?
would
this
party
then
be
qualified
in
those?
unknown
speaker
and
that
--
that
would
then
be
the
only
reason,
would
it?
that
they
had
not
complied
with
corrupt
practices
act?
unknown
speaker
or
under
148.
unknown
speaker
would
they
timely
though?
unknown
speaker
but
when
and
from
--
may
i
ask
this,
mr.
redden?
from
what
date
then
would
the
corrupt
practices
provision
within
five
days
apply?
unknown
speaker
now
if
it
were
september
5,
was
corrupt
prices
act
complied
with?
unknown
speaker
not
even
then?
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
say?
i
beg
your
pardon.
what
do
you
say
to
the
claim
that
there
has
been
discriminatory
enforcement
of
that
provision?
unknown
speaker
and
providing
--
and
there
has
been
enforcement
in
the
sense
of
excluding
people
from
the
ballot?
unknown
speaker
because
of
noncompliance?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
mr.
redden?
do
you
understand
the
party
to
make
any
claim
that
which
every
date
should
pick,
that
had
been
compliance
with
the
5-day
provision?
unknown
speaker
now,
you
finish
your
end.
unknown
speaker
then
you
would
say
that
that
was
done
on
september
20th.
that's
out
of
time
even
dating
this
from
september
5,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
which
then
would
relegate
if
that
was
so,
the
appellants
to
the
argument
that
it
was
this
provision,
its
requirement
has
not
been
evenhandedly
applied
and
there's
a
constitutional
infirmity
denial
of
equal
protection,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
is
that
an
argument
mr.
morgan
that
really
this
ought
to
be
treated
as
if
the
date
of
filing
was
the
date
that
the
court
ordered
to
put
on
the
ballot
which
was
the
16th?
unknown
speaker
then
in
both
places,
you
can
vote
mr.
morgan.
unknown
speaker
he
said
that?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
mr.
morgan
--
unknown
speaker
so
your
trusted
ballot
is
subject
to
bargaining,
is
there
any
usual
in
this
case
where
everything
about
this
ballot
are
standard

unknown

you're

unknown

going

what

the

that
has

what

unknown
speaker
the

unknown

no
but
i
think
you
it
would
not
have
to
be
done?
unknown
speaker
if
that's
the
way
she
wanted,
then
you
will
get
it.
is
that
the
kind
of
change
that
will
have
to
be
made?
unknown
speaker
oh,
what
happened
if
we
were
to
putting
you
on

are
there
any

unknown
speaker
well,
so
it's

the

but
frankly
whether
they're

the

unknown

of
the
office
of
the
vice

of

unknown
speaker
well
may
i
ask
you
this
way,
what
was
the
declaration
of
the
part
of
republican
party
before
march
1?
unknown
speaker
to
what?
unknown
speaker
they
don't
have
to
identify
the
candidates
that
they
are
going
to
support.
unknown
speaker
obviously
not
to
support
them.
unknown
speaker
that's
not
the
total
ballot
up
there?
unknown
speaker
if
you
want
to
run
about
a

is
that

unknown

alright,
89

of

under

unknown

you
mean
as
matters
now
stand
absent
to
this
court's

the
national
democratic
party
of
alabama
emblem
will
appear
on
the
ballot
and
then
there
will
be
only
two
candidates.
unknown
speaker
well
is
that
the
--
where
those
the
only
two
reasons
that
the
secretary
of
state
gave
to
--
unknown
speaker
well,
now
the
garrett
law,
i
guess
you
apparently
have
an
idea
of
what
the
garrett

but
one
of
those
cases
we

yesterday.
unknown

is
this
the
same
law
that's
in
--
that's
at

in
--
no
that's
a
mississippi
case?
unknown
speaker
i
understood,
they
haven't
asked
for
the
garrett

unknown

that's
passed
in
1967?
unknown

the
court
a
certificate
of
compliance
and
as
judge
johnson
says,
and
it's
not
our
phrase
it's
the
dissenting
judge
johnson's
phrase,
they're
disqualified
in
this
whole
slate
by
an
afterthought.
and
they're
doing
it
in
federal
court
by
a
document
filed
in
federal
court.
she
started
with
two
reasons.
she
lost
on
one
of
those,
now
she
has
two
new
--
one
new
reason.
and
she's
applying
the
corrupt
practices
act
and
it
looks
does
like
it's
clearly
equal
situation
because
it's
never
been
enforced
by
the
state.
unknown
speaker
what
did
the
court
do
about
it?
unknown
speaker
was
there
evidence
to
the
effect
that
the
state
had
never
enforced
that
law
to
court?
unknown
speaker
what
page?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
this
mr.
redden?
unknown
speaker
if
we
did
not
have
the
garrett
law
at
all,
alabama
has
not
adopted,
do
i
understand
you
to
say
by
may
7,
either
party
must
on
that
day
decide
on
convention
and
then
turn
up
with
nominees
within
60
days
before
elections,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
certify
them.
unknown
speaker
and
if
one
is
an
independent,
what
does
he
do?
unknown
speaker
the
same?
unknown
speaker
but
--
so
if
we
did
not
have
the
garrett
law
act
that
would
be
the
procedure?
unknown
speaker
and
now
may
i
ask
if
it
pleases,
did
this
party,
the
appellants
here,
what
do
they
do
before
they
set
to
run,
anything?
unknown
speaker
what's
the
date
of
that
law?
unknown
speaker
what's
the
date
of
that
law?
unknown
speaker
is
any
law
here
other
than
the
one
we
just
talked
about,
that's
1967?
unknown
speaker
that's
the
only
one.
all
the
other
laws
we're
talking
about
are
predate
1966.
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
say
about
the
carried
garrett
law
as
to
whether
or
not
it's
in
effect
or
not?
unknown
speaker
the
language
is
section
5,
is
it
mr.
redden?
the
language
of
section
5
is
whether
it's
a
standard
practice
of
procedure
not
whether
it's
a
device.
unknown
speaker
well
that
brings
me
back
to
what
i
was
asking
you
earlier.
if
we
felt
that
this
fell
--
that
the
garrett
act
fell
within
the
requirements
of
section
5
and
therefore
is
--
was
not
a
law.
so
that
what
then
was
required
as
compliance
with
whatever
law,
other
law
has
bear
on
the
section?
would
this
party
then
be
qualified
in
those?
unknown
speaker
and
that
--
that
would
then
be
the
only
reason,
would
it?
that
they
had
not
complied
with
corrupt
practices
act?
unknown
speaker
or
under
148.
unknown
speaker
would
they
timely
though?
unknown
speaker
but
when
and
from
--
may
i
ask
this,
mr.
redden?
from
what
date
then
would
the
corrupt
practices
provision
within
five
days
apply?
unknown
speaker
now
if
it
were
september
5,
was
corrupt
prices
act
complied
with?
unknown
speaker
not
even
then?
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
say?
i
beg
your
pardon.
what
do
you
say
to
the
claim
that
there
has
been
discriminatory
enforcement
of
that
provision?
unknown
speaker
and
providing
--
and
there
has
been
enforcement
in
the
sense
of
excluding
people
from
the
ballot?
unknown
speaker
because
of
noncompliance?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
mr.
redden?
do
you
understand
the
party
to
make
any
claim
that
which
every
date
should
pick,
that
had
been
compliance
with
the
5-day
provision?
unknown
speaker
now,
you
finish
your
end.
unknown
speaker
then
you
would
say
that
that
was
done
on
september
20th.
that's
out
of
time
even
dating
this
from
september
5,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
which
then
would
relegate
if
that
was
so,
the
appellants
to
the
argument
that
it
was
this
provision,
its
requirement
has
not
been
evenhandedly
applied
and
there's
a
constitutional
infirmity
denial
of
equal
protection,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
is
that
an
argument
mr.
morgan
that
really
this
ought
to
be
treated
as
if
the
date
of
filing
was
the
date
that
the
court
ordered
to
put
on
the
ballot
which
was
the
16th?
unknown
speaker
then
in
both
places,
you
can
vote
mr.
morgan.
