justice
abe
fortas
now
you
did
not
--
the
attorney
general
did
not
in
the
telegram
sent
to
this
court
assert
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
comply
with
an
order,
if
it
were
in
the
granting
the
relief
requested.
justice
abe
fortas
you
are
not
now
--
are
you
now
saying
that
compliance
would
be
impossible
or
are
you
not?
justice
abe
fortas
when
are
the
primaries
held
by
the
democratic
and
republican
parties?
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
in
effect,
the
result
of
this
would
be
that
to
make
it
impossible
for
somebody
to
submit
his
name
to
one
of
the
regular
parties
and
then
if
defeated,
qualified
later.
justice
abe
fortas
how
can
--
he
couldn't
do
that
though.
that
can
happen
as
practical
matter.
here's
mr.
x
and
he
says
that
he's
going
to
make
a
run
for
it
to
the
get
the
nomination
of
the
democratic
party
or
the
republican
party,
he
fails.
and
then
he
wants
to
run
as
an
independent
or
some
other
party
wants
to
nominate
him.
that's
impossible
under
your
law.
justice
abe
fortas
now
when
was
that
legislation
adopted?
justice
abe
fortas
how
about
that
march
provision?
justice
abe
fortas
and
it
was
not
--
there
was
no
attempt
to
comply
with
section
5
of
the
voting
rights
act.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
morgan,
may
i
ask
you
a
preliminary
question?
justice
abe
fortas
do
you
contest
the
point
that
statement
was
not
filed
for
these
presidential
electors
naming
their
committee
or
themselves
as
the
committee
for
fund
collection.
justice
abe
fortas
wait
a
minute.
do
you
contest
the
point
that
such
a
statement
was
not
filed
within
five
days
after
the
first
announcement
of
candidacy
for
those
officers?
justice
abe
fortas
now
tell
me
why.
justice
abe
fortas
remember
i'm
talking
in
the
statutory
language,
the
announcement
of
a
candidacy.
justice
abe
fortas
but
its
no,
what
the
statute
says.
justice
abe
fortas
and
your
point
is
that
this
is
going
to
construe
by
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
to
mean
the
filing
of
the
certificate
of
candidacy?
justice
abe
fortas
of
nomination.
justice
abe
fortas
alright,
now
let
me
ask
you.
do
you
assert,
do
you
concede
that
the
required
statement
as
to
the
committee
was
not
filed
within
five
days
after
the
filing
of
that
certificate
of
nomination?
justice
abe
fortas
right.
justice
abe
fortas
right.
but
with
that
exception
you
concede
that
it
was
not
filed
within
five
days
after
that
date?
justice
abe
fortas
and
how
do
you
explain,
how
do
you
justify
that
one?
justice
abe
fortas
apart
from
that,
just
tell
me
simply.
justice
abe
fortas
i
know
but
that's
not
the
--
is
it
--
the
herndon
against
lee
on
your
submission
put
says
the
trigger
date,
the
critical
time,
the
filing
of
the
certificate
of
nomination,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
it
does
not
say
anything
about
whether
the
certificate
--
whether
the
person
is
going
on
the
ballot
or
is
not
going
on
the
ballot,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
well
that's
not
very
onerous
requirement
and
it's
one
that's
often
make
some
sense,
isn't
it
that
you
name
the
person,
is
going
to
be
responsible
for
a
compliance
with
the
laws
with
respect
to
the
collection,
to
seek
in
disbursement
of
political
funds?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
mr.
morgan
you're
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
now
stating
your
submission,
but
this
is
not
what
the
record
shows,
is
it,
as
to
the
reasons
prompting
the
respondent?
justice
abe
fortas
no,
i'd
like
to
know
what's
in
the
record.
justice
abe
fortas
the
only
reason
is
his
reason
in
the
record
here.
justice
abe
fortas
how
did
those
depositions
tend
to
be
taken?
was
there
earlier
contempt
proceedings
about
it
in
a
district
court
or
--
justice
abe
fortas
precisely
what
sort
of
order
do
you
think
we
should
enter,
mr.
claiborne,
if
we
adopted
that
approach
to
the
problem?
justice
abe
fortas
contempt
of
what?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that
was
in
fact
why
i
was
asking
this.
justice
abe
fortas
would
that
foreclose
the
possibility
that
there
was
a
contempt
of
the
order
of
this
court
or
would
we,
in
effect,
be
asking
the
district
court
to
determine
whether
there
had
been
a
contempt
of
the
order
of
this
court
as
well
as
of
the
district
court?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i'm
sure
you
see
what's
bothering
me
as
a
procedural
matter.
in
united
states
against
ship,
there
was
the
appointment
of
a
commissioner
to
take
testimony
and
that
was
pursuant
to
an
order
to
show
cause,
wasn't
it,
why
the
defendant
should
not
be
held
in
contempt?
justice
abe
fortas
that's
what
the
district
court
might
have
to
do,
is
to
proceed
to
determine
whether
there's
a
contempt
of
its
own
order.
now,
without
some
further
specification
by
this
court
for
which
i
know
of
no
precedent,
maybe
there's
one.
the
district
court
--
it
would
be
a
little
awkward
for
the
district
court
to
proceed
to
determine
whether
there's
been
a
contempt
of
an
order
of
this
court.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
claiborne,
if
you'll
forgive
me,
is
there
--
i
forget,
is
there
another
instance
of
--
reported
instance
of
proceedings
in
this
court
on
contempt
in
addition
to
ship?
is
there
anything
else
in
the
books?
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
cited,
do
you
recall
whether
it's
cited
in
any
of
the
briefs?
justice
abe
fortas
but,
mr.
redden,
i
take
it
that
that
--
your
argument,
thus
far,
goes
to
only
one
branch
of
the
submission
of
your
adversary
on
this
point.
the
other
branch
of
their
argument
is,
as
i
understand
it,
is
reflected
in
judge
johnson's
dissent
in
which
he
says,
as
i
recall,
that
the
law
has
been
discriminatorily
in
--
applied
here.
that
is
to
say
that
it
has
not
been
applied
in
the
past
and
that,
for
whatever
reasons,
the
state
election
officials
chose
to
apply
that
provision
of
the
corrupt
practices
act
in
this
case
to
these
people.
now,
what
i'd
like
to
know
is,
and
i
don't
recall,
what,
if
anything,
is
there
in
the
record
to
support
the
proposition
that
the
law
has
--
was
discriminatorily
applied?
that
is
to
say
that
these
instances
were
selected
for
the
application
of
a
law
which
had
not
been
faithfully
applied
in
the
past.
justice
abe
fortas
is
there
any
record
of
candidates
other
than
these
being
disqualified
in
an
alabama
election
for
failure
to
make
this
filing
or
for
late
filing?
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that.
i
was
asking,
is
there
any
such
record.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
redden,
were
you
counsel
for
the
state
officials
when
we
issued
our
order
restoring
or
whatever
it
was
the
order
of
the
district
court?
justice
abe
fortas
when
you
first
appeared.
justice
abe
fortas
i
know
you
don't
want
to
make
the
argument
on
the
contempt
matter,
but
if
you
have
time
now
or
after
the
luncheon
recess,
i
should
certainly
appreciate
your
telling
us
what
you
did
to
see
that
our
order
was
communicated
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
to
the
various
--
to
the
appropriate
officials.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
you're
specially
retained
for
this
case.
you're
not
--
justice
abe
fortas
you're
not
a
state
official.
justice
abe
fortas
who
was
that
you
called?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
this
is
--
we're
up
to
about
eight
days
before
the
election.
justice
abe
fortas
what
date
was
that?
justice
abe
fortas
that
the
ballot
for
the
general
election
was
printed.
justice
abe
fortas
let's
see
if
i
understand
this.
in
october
14,
judge
herndon
ordered
the
greene
county
ballot
printed?
justice
abe
fortas
that
greene
county
ballot
was
delivered
to
him
on
october
17.
justice
abe
fortas
when
did
he
first
get
notice
that
this
court
had
entered
some
sort
of
an
order
in
the
premises?
justice
abe
fortas
on
the
15th,
he
learned
then
that
this
court
had
entered
an
order
with
respect
to
the
pending
controversy,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
and,
what
did
he
do
next?
did
he
take
any
steps
to
ascertain
what
was
in
that
order?
justice
abe
fortas
did
he
ever
receive
any
--
does
the
record
show
if
he
ever
received
a
communication
from
a
state
official
or
from
somebody
--
justice
abe
fortas
some
other
official?
justice
abe
fortas
it's
this
record,
is
it
the
record
before
us?
justice
abe
fortas
and,
did
he
testify
as
to
what
his
understanding
was
of
the
nature
of
the
order
entered
by
this
court?
justice
abe
fortas
are
those
articles
in
the
record
before
us?
justice
abe
fortas
i
don't
believe
they're
in
the
printed
record
before
where
we
have
printed
appendix.
i
could
be
wrong
about
that.
justice
abe
fortas
but,
they
are
in
the
printed
record
--
i
mean,
the
typed
record.
justice
abe
fortas
isn't
it
--
do
you
agree
or
disagree
that
it
was
somebody's
duty
to
notify
all
of
the
probate
judges
of
the
order
entered
by
this
court?
justice
abe
fortas
and,
somehow
rather,
that
was
not
done.
is
that
your
position
here?
justice
abe
fortas
i
--
and
that
your
position
is
that
the
only
notice
or
knowledge
of
judge
herndon
had
was
the
article
which
he
read
in
the
newspapers.
justice
abe
fortas
and
you
know
it.
now,
suppose
that
he
had
--
i
take
it,
from
what
you
earlier
said,
that
if
this
article
had
said
plainly
that
the
candidates
for
local
office
in
greene
county
were
required
by
i
--
the
order
of
this
court
to
be
placed
on
the
ballot,
then
judge
herndon
would've
had
the
duty
to
do
so.
that
is
to
say,
he
would've
had
actual
knowledge.
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
the
matter,
so
far
as
judge
herndon
is
concerned,
regardless
of
what
the
position,
if
any,
may
be
with
respect
to
anybody
else.
he
would
then
not
notify
the
probate
judges.
so
far
as
judge
herndon
is
concerned,
your
submission
then
is
that
this
turns
on
a
question
of
fact?
justice
abe
fortas
and
that
the
record
before
us
does
not
show
that
he
had
notice
or
knowledge
either
formal
or
informal.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
hubbard.
justice
abe
fortas
before
you
sit
down,
may
i
ask
you,
i
suppose
that
the
test
as
to
whether
we
should
issue
the
order
to
show
cause,
which
is
the
only
thing
that's
before
us
now
in
this
branch
of
the
case,
is
whether
there
has
been
a
prima
facie
showing
of
contempt.
is
that
--
would
you
agree?
justice
abe
fortas
should
at
least
on
a
--
justice
abe
fortas
--higher
standard
of
proof?
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
but,
let's
say
that
we're
satisfied
as
to
the
questions
of
the
law.
then,
on
the
factual
side,
i
suppose
that
showing
has
to
be
made
to
us
as
a
prima
facie
case
or
probable
cause
or
something
like
that,
isn't
it?
it's
--
justice
abe
fortas
less
than
a
conviction
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
on
our
part.
justice
abe
fortas
are
you
talking
about
the
typewritten
record?
justice
abe
fortas
that's
not
in
the
printed
appendix.
justice
abe
fortas
i
see.
justice
abe
fortas
now
you
did
not
--
the
attorney
general
did
not
in
the
telegram
sent
to
this
court
assert
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
comply
with
an
order,
if
it
were
in
the
granting
the
relief
requested.
justice
abe
fortas
you
are
not
now
--
are
you
now
saying
that
compliance
would
be
impossible
or
are
you
not?
justice
abe
fortas
when
are
the
primaries
held
by
the
democratic
and
republican
parties?
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
in
effect,
the
result
of
this
would
be
that
to
make
it
impossible
for
somebody
to
submit
his
name
to
one
of
the
regular
parties
and
then
if
defeated,
qualified
later.
justice
abe
fortas
how
can
--
he
couldn't
do
that
though.
that
can
happen
as
practical
matter.
here's
mr.
x
and
he
says
that
he's
going
to
make
a
run
for
it
to
the
get
the
nomination
of
the
democratic
party
or
the
republican
party,
he
fails.
and
then
he
wants
to
run
as
an
independent
or
some
other
party
wants
to
nominate
him.
that's
impossible
under
your
law.
justice
abe
fortas
now
when
was
that
legislation
adopted?
justice
abe
fortas
how
about
that

fortas
well,
that
was
in
fact
why
i
was
asking
this.
justice
abe
fortas
would
that
foreclose
the
possibility
that
there
was
a
contempt
of
the
order
of
this
court
or
would
we,
in
effect,
be
asking
the
district
court
to
determine
whether
there
had
been
a
contempt
of
the
order
of
this
court
as
well
as
of
the
district
court?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i'm
sure
you
see
what's
bothering
me
as
a
procedural
matter.
in
united
states
against
ship,
there
was
the
appointment
of
a
commissioner
to
take
testimony
and
that
was
pursuant
to
an
order
to
show
cause,
wasn't
it,
why
the
defendant
should
not
be
held
in
contempt?
justice
abe
fortas
that's
what
the
district
court
might
have
to
do,
is
to
proceed
to
determine
whether
there's
a
contempt
of
its
own
order.
now,
without
some
further
specification
by
this
court
for
which
i
know
of
no
precedent,
maybe
there's
one.
the
district
court
--
it
would
be
a
little
awkward
for
the
district
court
to
proceed
to
determine
whether
there's
been
a
contempt
of
an
order
of
this
court.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
claiborne,
if
you'll
forgive
me,
is
there
--
i
forget,
is
there
another
instance
of
--
reported
instance
of
proceedings
in
this
court
on
contempt
in
addition
to
ship?
is
there
anything
else
in
the
books?
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
cited,
do
you
recall
whether
it's
cited
in
any
of
the
briefs?
justice
abe
fortas
but,
mr.
redden,
i
take
it
that
that
--
your
argument,
thus
far,
goes
to
only
one
branch
of
the
submission
of
your
adversary
on
this
point.
the
other
branch
of
their
argument
is,
as
i
understand
it,
is
reflected
in
judge
johnson's
dissent
in
which
he
says,
as
i
recall,
that
the
law
has
been
discriminatorily
in
--
applied
here.
that
is
to
say
that
it
has
not
been
applied
in
the
past
and
that,
for
whatever
reasons,
the
state
election
officials
chose
to
apply
that
provision
of
the
corrupt
practices
act
in
this
case
to
these
people.
now,
what
i'd
like
to
know
is,
and
i
don't
recall,
what,
if
anything,
is
there
in
the
record
to
support
the
proposition
that
the
law
has
--
was
discriminatorily
applied?
that
is
to
say
that
these
instances
were
selected
for
the
application
of
a
law
which
had
not
been
faithfully
applied
in
the
past.
justice
abe
fortas
is
there
any
record
of
candidates
other
than
these
being
disqualified
in
an
alabama
election
for
failure
to
make
this
filing
or
for
late
filing?
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that.
i
was
asking,
is
there
any
such
record.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
redden,
were
you
counsel
for
the
state
officials
when
we
issued
our
order
restoring
or
whatever
it
was
the
order
of
the
district
court?
justice
abe
fortas
when
you
first
appeared.
justice
abe
fortas
i
know
you
don't
want
to
make
the
argument
on
the
contempt
matter,
but
if
you
have
time
now
or
after
the
luncheon
recess,
i
should
certainly
appreciate
your
telling
us
what
you
did
to
see
that
our
order
was
communicated
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
to
the
various
--
to
the
appropriate
officials.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
you're
specially
retained
for
this
case.
you're
not
--
justice
abe
fortas
you're
not
a
state
official.
justice
abe
fortas
who
was
that
you
called?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
this
is
--
we're
up
to
about
eight
days
before
the
election.
justice
abe
fortas
what
date
was
that?
justice
abe
fortas
that
the
ballot
for
the
general
election
was
printed.
justice
abe
fortas
let's
see
if
i
understand
this.
in
october
14,
judge
herndon
ordered
the
greene
county
ballot
printed?
justice
abe
fortas
that
greene
county
ballot
was
delivered
to
him
on
october
17.
justice
abe
fortas
when
did
he
first
get
notice
that
this
court
had
entered
some
sort
of
an
order
in
the
premises?
justice
abe
fortas
on
the
15th,
he
learned
then
that
this
court
had
entered
an
order
with
respect
to
the
pending
controversy,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
and,
what
did
he
do
next?
did
he
take
any
steps
to
ascertain
what
was
in
that
order?
justice
abe
fortas
did
he
ever
receive
any
--
does
the
record
show
if
he
ever
received
a
communication
from
a
state
official
or
from
somebody
--
justice
abe
fortas
some
other
official?
justice
abe
fortas
it's
this
record,
is
it
the
record
before
us?
justice
abe
fortas
and,
did
he
testify
as
to
what
his
understanding
was
of
the
nature
of
the
order
entered
by
this
court?
justice
abe
fortas
are
those
articles
in
the
record
before
us?
justice
abe
fortas
i
don't
believe
they're
in
the
printed
record
before
where
we
have
printed
appendix.
i
could
be
wrong
about
that.
justice
abe
fortas
but,
they
are
in
the
printed
record
--
i
mean,
the
typed
record.
justice
abe
fortas
isn't
it
--
do
you
agree
or
disagree
that
it
was
somebody's
duty
to
notify
all
of
the
probate
judges
of
the
order
entered
by
this
court?
justice
abe
fortas
and,
somehow
rather,
that
was
not
done.
is
that
your
position
here?
justice
abe
fortas
i
--
and
that
your
position
is
that
the
only
notice
or
knowledge
of
judge
herndon
had
was
the
article
which
he
read
in
the
newspapers.
justice
abe
fortas
and
you
know
it.
now,
suppose
that
he
had
--
i
take
it,
from
what
you
earlier
said,
that
if
this
article
had
said
plainly
that
the
candidates
for
local
office
in
greene
county
were
required
by
i
--
the
order
of
this
court
to
be
placed
on
the
ballot,
then
judge
herndon
would've
had
the
duty
to
do
so.
that
is
to
say,
he
would've
had
actual
knowledge.
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
the
matter,
so
far
as
judge
herndon
is
concerned,
regardless
of
what
the
position,
if
any,
may
be
with
respect
to
anybody
else.
he
would
then
not
notify
the
probate
judges.
so
far
as
judge
herndon
is
concerned,
your
submission
then
is
that
this
turns
on
a
question
of
fact?
justice
abe
fortas
and
that
the
record
before
us
does
not
show
that
he
had
notice
or
knowledge
either
formal
or
informal.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
hubbard.
justice
abe
fortas
before
you
sit
down,
may
i
ask
you,
i
suppose
that
the
test
as
to
whether
we
should
issue
the
order
to
show
cause,
which
is
the
only
thing
that's
before
us
now
in
this
branch
of
the
case,
is
whether
there
has
been
a
prima
facie
showing
of
contempt.
is
that
--
would
you
agree?
justice
abe
fortas
should
at
least
on
a
--
justice
abe
fortas
--higher
standard
of
proof?
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
but,
let's
say
that
we're
satisfied
as
to
the
questions
of
the
law.
then,
on
the
factual
side,
i
suppose
that
showing
has
to
be
made
to
us
as
a
prima
facie
case
or
probable
cause
or
something
like
that,
isn't
it?
it's
--
justice
abe
fortas
less
than
a
conviction
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
on
our
part.
justice
abe
fortas
are
you
talking
about
the
typewritten
record?
justice
abe
fortas
that's
not
in
the
printed
appendix.
justice
abe
fortas
i
see.
