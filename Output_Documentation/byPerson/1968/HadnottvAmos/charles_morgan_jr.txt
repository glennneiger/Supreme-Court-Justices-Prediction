mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
we
have
here
behind
us
a
copy
of
the
alabama
ballot
as
it
appears
in
the
record.
this
is
a
reproduction
from
the
record,
exhibit
g
to
the
amos
deposition.
you'll
notice
on
the
seventh
columns
on
the
ballot
there're
eight,
some
independent
candidates
over
here.
in
column
1
you
have
eight
electors
only.
column
1
is
the
alabama
independent
democratic
party,
a
political
party
that
was
established
that
in
a
certificate
of
incorporation
states
the
party
shall
have
no
members
and
secondly
states
in
its
certificate
of
incorporation,
the
party
shall
ran
no
candidates
for
office
for
local
state
or
national
office
except
presidential
elector.
this
party
has
been
described
by
defendant
amos.
defendant
amos
is
herself
a
presidential
elector
candidate
on
column
number
3
as
a
party
within
a
party.
by
voting
on
column
number
1,
a
voter
cast
his
ballot
for
the
humphrey-muskie
ticket
for
president.
by
voting
column
number
3
he
votes
the
straight
democratic
ticket
in
the
state
of
alabama
and
thereby
cast
his
ballot
for
george
corley
wallace
for
president.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
ten.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
ten
electors
and
of
course
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
no
sir,
they
are
10.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes,
sir.
there
are
10,
and
this
column,
in
column
3
and
in
column
6
and
also
column
5
which
is
the
republican
column.
now
in
alabama
a
voter
if
he
votes
a
straight
democratic
ticket
votes
for
all
the
local
nominees
the
democratic
party
right
down
through
o'connor
and
others
all
the
way
down
the
line.
if
he
votes
for
straight
republican
ticket,
he
votes
of
course
with
mr.
nixon
and
mr.
agnew
and
all
the
way
down
the
line
he
votes
for
the
republican
nominees.
if
he
votes
this
party's
ticket,
the
national
democratic
party
of
alabama
were
appellants
here,
he
votes
a
straight
party
ticket
for
electors
pledge
to
humphrey-muskie
unless
disavowed
by
it
which
has
not
occurred.
he
also
votes
a
straight
party
ticket
down
the
line
on
those
counties
upon
which
candidates
appear
for
this
party.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
no
humphrey-muskie
here
in
column
3.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
that's
right.
in
column
1,
no
they're
not.
we
have
entered
into
a
stipulation
with
the
chairman
of
this
political
party.
and
under
alabama
law,
a
political
party
can
replace
vacancies
or
refill
vacancies
with
others.
and
in
the
event
section
148
of
the
alabama
statute,
title
17
which
prohibits
people
from
appearing
on
a
more
than
one
ballot
envelope
in
the
same
election.
that
in
the
event
that's
stricken
down
these
electors
will
be
removed
by
the
party
will
resign.
and
these
electors
will
then
move
over
so
there'll
be
no
dilution
of
the
humphrey-muskie
vote
in
the
state.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
they
can
be
if
the
court,
you
know,
allows
that
is
a
former
remedy
in
the
district
court
if
it's
so
instructed
here.
there's
no
physical
problem
with
that
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well
that's
in
section
148
simply
prohibits
them
appearing
on
the
ballot
twice
and
that
is
the
principle
statute
as
i
understand
that
would
prevent
them
from
being
aggregated.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
now
that
statute
coupled
--
a
week
it
became
that
statute
with
this
particular
election
is
certainly
unconstitutional
on
this
application.
it
may
not
be
unconstitutional
on
it's
face,
two
states
have
held
that
it
is,
one
state
of
new
york
of
course
has
held
that
in
almost
a
pre-close
course
of
the
voting
rights
act
has
said
that
a
party
may
nominate
whoever
it
pleases,
if
they
don't
withdraw
that's
all
right.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well,
not
really.
what
you
have
there
is
an
intervention
petition
for
citizens
from
the
local
citizens
for
humphrey-muskie.
in
there,
you
will
find
the
name
of
the
intervention
petition
of
one
of
the
three
co-chairman
david
j.
vaughn.
david
j.vaughn
is
the
chairman
of
this
political
party
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
edward
f.
malden
says
that
these
electors
should
be
removed.
these
should
be
left
on
the
ballot.
david
j.
vaughn
who
was
chairman
of
this
party
says
at
the
event
that
statute
is
brought
down
are
inapplicable.
these
electors
would
not
withdraw
a
place
on
this
ballot
here.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes.
mr.
vaughn
says,
who
is
chairman
of
this
party
has
represented
in
court,
its'
in
the
record,
that
these
parties
will
not
withdraw
these
electors
if
by
it's
on
the
ballot
under
this
ticket.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
now
you
have
a
second
provision
of
alabama
statutes
which
says
that
a
person
has
the
right
to
vote
a
straight
party
ticket.
two
provisions
of
law
that
provide
that,
this
is
a
voting
rights
act
state
of
course.
and
it's
been
determined
as
of
november
the
1st
1964
to
be
such.
i
don't
think
that
it's
too
difficult
to
say
that
this
ballot
is
fairly
confusing,
almost
a
test
or
device
to
illiterate
person.
if
an
illiterate
person
walks
in
he
can
flip
this
lever
here
then
he
has
the
one
roll
across
this
ballot
finding
whoever
he
wants.
if
these
candidates
are
not
on
the
ballot
he
will
find
few
of
any
negroes,
perhaps
one
or
two
running
for
constable
in
a
couple
of
counties.
this
ticket
under
column
7
has
of
course
a
substantial
number
of
negro
voters
and
candidates
on
it.
they
are
not
in
every
county
in
the
state
of
alabama.
there
are
not
very
many
negroes
in
some
counties
in
the
state
of
alabama.
we
started
with
the
sort
of
--
call
it
23
counties,
it
was
win
or
down
one
way
or
another
to
17
now.
we
believe
that
under
the
voting
rights
act
the
fifteenth
amendment
and
otherwise,
folks
have
a
right
to
vote
a
straight
party
ticket.
and
they
have
the
right
to
have
candidates
on
the
ballot.
we
also
believe
the
record
in
this
case
clearly
discloses
the
motive
and
the
reason
for
the
disqualification
of
this
party
in
column
number
7.
now
this
is
not
a
separatist
party,
this
is
an
integrated
party.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
i
take
it
only
on
ancillary
way
we
contest
the
other
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well,
i'm
not
making
it
directly
but
i
want
to
tie
it
back
in
a
moment
to
the
garrett
law
and
under
which
we're
disqualified
and
the
corrupt
practices
act
under
which
they
stay
we're
disqualified
i
can't
quite
understand
that
myself
and
to
tie
this
back
to
that
to
show
the
confusing
nature
of
the
ballot
and
move
it
forward
so
that
the
whole
procedure
looks
like
a
test
or
device
on
serving
those
statutes
are.
now
what
we
contend
with
respect
to
this
ballot
is
that
in
the
event
this
ticket's
not
on
the
ballot,
the
state
democratic
party
which
will
be
carried
by
the
wallace
electors
if
it
all
would
then
have
propped
into
the
political
system
from
which
negroes
have
been
excluded
for
a
hundred
years
the
negro
vote.
and
we
think
the
record
amply
discloses
the
way
that
this
whole
procedure
came
about.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
surely.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
temporary
restraining
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
nothing,
it
put
us
on
the
ballot.
it
put
this
column
7
on
the
ballot
that's
what
it
did.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
i
really
think
not.
you
see
it's
very
confusing
that
the
secretary
of
state
stated
herself.
she
didn't
quite
know
when
was
the
last
day
she
can
print
ballots
in
depositions.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
i
think
that
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
i
think
that
the
--
if
the
ballots
are
already
printed,
that
would
be
the
case
but
i
don't
think
the
ballots
are
printed.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
they
may
have
printed
absentee
ballots.
but
the
state
would
know
more
about
that
than
i
do
but
i
don't
believe
that
they
have.
i
believe
that
they
are
still
waiting
right
now.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes
sir
and
if
that
doesn't
happen,
of
course
we
want
this
column
7
electors
to
stay
on
there
as
they
are
now.
the
vice
president
and
mr.
muskie
have
made
no
election
not
to
appear
on
the
ballot
under
this
ticket.
mr.
wallace
did
that
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes,
sir
in
alabama
it
does.
it
would
put
him
in
a
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
because
they're
different
people,
because
the
candidates'
names
don't
appear
on
the
ballot
themselves.
but
what
we
contend
is
of
course
that
that
can
be
done
and
that
it
can
be
done
quite
simply
and
easily.
and
it
could
be
done
with
an
order
in
order
to
aggregate
the
votes
and
in
the
rights
we
have,
we
would
be
willing
to
waive
to
go
over
that
way.
but
we
do
think
that
certainly
illiterate
voters
have
a
right
to
walk
in
and
vote
the
straight
party
ticket
if
literate
voters
do
and
if
republicans
and
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
no,
not
really.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well
it's
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
that
--
well
they
need
two
things.
they
first
of
all
need
the
right
to
vote
a
straight
party
ticket
and
then
secondly
they
need
somebody
to
vote
for.
and
the
secretary
of
state
hasn't
given
them
that.
what's
happened
and
neither
the
district
court
order.
now
what
happened
was
along
about
august
14,
the
secretary
of
state,
re-exist
some
documents
the
best
evidence
of
which
according
to
the
district
court
was
an
affidavit
from
a
blind
man
saying,
that
he
happen
to
heard
the
mass
meeting
in
the
madison
county
courthouse.
she
relied
upon
that
and
said
that
this
party
could
not
appear
on
the
ballot.
on
september
5,
she
recounted,
said
the
party
could
appear
on
the
ballot
and
prior
to
that
time
and
public
statements
in
the
press.
following
that,
on
september
10,
she
says
“no,
you
can't
appear
on
the
ballot
except
for
two
candidates.”
by
september
13,
of
course
would
file
suit
and
we
were
endeavoring
at
that
time
to
get
here
by
the
time
of
williams
which
you
decided
too.
now,
she
is
of
course
the
secretary
of
state,
a
wallace
president
elector.
seven
of
these
presidential
elector
candidates
on
column
3
are
the
highest
state
public
officials
there
are.
two
others
are
the
wives
of
united
states
senatorial
candidates
and
i
forgotten
who
the
tenth
one
is.
now
in
this
particular
instance,
she
says
“no,
you
can't
get
on
the
ballot
because
you
missed
on
that
mass
meeting.”
we
took
voluminous
evidence
and
the
district
court
unanimously,
there's
no
question
about
this.
he
said
“no
mrs.
amos,
you
deprive
this
people
of
their
rights
to
equal
protection
under
the
laws
by
depriving
them
with
the
right
to
appear
on
the
ballot
on
the
basis
of
that
mass
meeting
and
you
mrs.
amos
must
pay
one-half
the
cost.”
now
she
had
a
second
ground,
she
denied
them
the
right
to
appear
on
the
ballot.
she
said
they
didn't
comply
with
the
garrett
law,
act
243
of
alabama
legislature.
and
the
garrett
law
simply
says
this.
it
says,
“you
must
file
a
declaration
of
intention
to
run
by
march
1st.”
that's
250
days
before
the
general
election.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
it's
made
up
in
a
form
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
it
just
says,
“i
hereby
declare
my
self
to
be
a
candidate
for
such
and
such
an
office
and
such
and
such
a
county
or
such
a
statewide
office
and
i
do
certify
that
i,
you
know,
intend
to
become
one.”
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well
one
says
nothing
apparently
in
alabama
because
you
see
again,
this
--
you
see
we
haven't
been
able
to
vote
a
full
ballot
in
alabama.
in
the
five
or
last
six
presidential
elections
because
we
always
have
electors
and
we
were
democrat.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
their
electors
file
declarations
of
intention.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
to
run
for
presidential
elector.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
no.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
not
on
the
form
that
they
file,
it's
my
recollection,
they
don't
--
they
could
but
i'm
not
certain
with
that
but
i
don't
think
they
do.
they
just
simply
file
as
republican
electors
and
folks
assume
that
they
are
vote
that
way.
now
the
democratic
--
column
3
electors
are
selected
differently.
they
run
in
the
primary.
they
run
as
pledged
to
wallace
and
run
in
this
date,
as
wallace
pledged
electors.
now
this
is
the
one
state
of
the
50
that
he
appears
on
the
democratic
ticket.
he
appeared
on
the
third
party
tickets
elsewhere.
now,
what
happens
here
is
exactly
parallel
to
williams.
exactly
with
respect
to
time
except
it's
250
days
in
alabama,
272
days
in
ohio.
now
the
second
problem
with
the
declaration
of
intent
statute
is
this.
there
are
a
lot
of
people
you
don't
--
who
don't
want
to
run
for
office,
first
if
you'd
have
a
declaration
of
intent
statute
nationally,
adlai
stevenson
would
not
have
been
the
democratic
nominee
in
1952.
he
couldn't
have
qualified.
if
he
was
in
fact
drafted
and
i
believe
he
was.
beyond
that,
there
are
number
of
people
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes
but
you
see
in
alabama
you
have
different
systems.
only
one
--
only
these
are
electors,
you
see
we
are
really
very
concerned
about
the
folks
down
the
ballot
too
because
we
are
running
people
for
a
local
and
state
office
in
local
county
boards
of
revenue
and
places
often
in
the
black
belt
areas
and
other
place.
we've
got
a
candidate
for
congress
running
in
the
district.
in
the
fifth
congressional
district,
william
mckinley
branch,
he
is
a
negro.
now
you
can
look
at
the
two
independent
candidates,
they're
both
white.
gibbs
is
white.
donaldson
is
white.
clovers
is
white.
there's
approximately
30%
negro
vote
in
that
district
and
day
before
yesterday,
the
northern
district
of
alabama
entered
an
order
allowing
college
students
to
register
in
tuscaloosa,
alabama
in
that
district.
it's
a
very
real
matter
to
that
congressional
candidate
who
is
a
negro
in
this
election
with
respect
to
prospects
of
being
elected
and
there
are
others
down
the
line
too
in
other
counties
for
board
of
education
post,
for
post
of
county
--
on
county
commissioners
and
these
folks
are
trying
to
seek
and
force
away
into
american
life.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
oh,
no.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
a
hundred
candidates
in
the
district
court
said
we
counted
89
as
i
recall
it.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
as
matters
now
stand,
they
are
in
the
order
but
they
wouldn't
be
without
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
two
would
be.
for
some
reason
as
the
district
court
says
in
its
majority
opinion
unexplained
to
them.
they
allowed
the
reverend
william
mckinley
branch
to
run
and
ms.
copeland
to
run
for
a
special
election
to
fill
a
vacancy
in
the
state
legislature.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
under
the
national
democratic
party
of
alabama.
now
this
party
of
course
--
know
that
party
in
alabama
does.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
only
two
candidates
in
the
place
and
we
are
not
even
sure
of
that
because
we've
been
turned
back
over
to
the
tender
mercies
of
mrs.
amos
and
67
white
probate
judges
of
the
state
of
alabama
by
the
majority
opinion.
and
we
don't
really
know
where
we
are
with
respect
to
it
or
where
we
will
be
with
respect
to
the
ballot
and
once
we
leave
this
court
if
we
go
back
to
the
majority
opinion
down
there,
we
don't
know
where
we
will
be
there.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
she
had
to
--
one
mass
meeting
was
wrong
and
the
declaration
of
intent
statutes,
you
made
that
quite
clear.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well
that's
right
and
certainly
that's
under
the
voting
rights
act
and
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
there's
no
need
to
get
to
his
constitutionality
unless
it
complies
with
section
5
or
--
and
4
(b)
of
the
voting
rights
act.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
it's
the
same
issue
i'd
say
that
you
are
in
the
button
case.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes,
sir.
the
others
have,
you
know,
reapportionment
figured
into
this
don't,
whitley
does
in
the
court
below
and
the
brief
below.
the
case
of
sellers
versus
trussell
has
been
cited
by
counsel
and
also
cited
by
the
court.
the
majority
pinion
is
somehow
authority
for
them.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes.
as
the
--
as
the
attorney
general
as
mr.
pollak
stated
the
other
day,
alabama
has
asked
for
approval
of
the
attorney
general
in
only
one
statute
that
was
in
november
1965
or
1966,
i
guess
it
was.
since
then,
they've
asked
for
none.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
they
haven't
asked
for
it,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
passed
in
1967.
and
of
course
this
affects
your
button
case
which
doesn't
involve
reapportionment
affects
of
candidacies.
this
affects
everybody
in
the
state.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well,
the
district
court
ruled
the
majority.
all
of
them
said
that
it's
constitutional
on
its
face.
it
requires
you
to
file
within
five
days
afterwards.
the
majority
says,
it's
constitutional
on
its
face
and
there
was
no
unequal
application.
judge
johnson
says,
there
is
an
unequal
application
under
equal
law.
he
says
that
there's
been
private
enforcement
constantly.
the
public
has
never
enforced
this
law.
public
officials
have
never
enforced
this
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
on
the
garrett
law
and
on
that
reason
to
the
ones.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
there
was
evidence
that
--
we
found
no
evidence
that
the
state
had
ever
enforced
it.
the
private
parties
had
always
enforced
it
all
the
way
through.
private
parties
would
go
in
and
follow
action
against
their
opponent
by
in
large.
their
opponent
then
would
intervene,
come
in
the
case
and
we
go
up.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes
we
are
--
it
was
filed
by
me
as
counsel
for
all
of
those
people
and
was
mailed
to
everybody
in
the
state,
every
probate
judge
within
two
days
after
the
order
was
applicable
with
every
candidate's
name.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
time
if
i
may.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
surely.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mrs.
amos
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
on
the
first
place.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes
sir.
herndon
versus
lee
is
relied
upon
as
the
law
of
alabama,
that's
relied
upon
in
brief,
that's
relied
upon
in
the
majority
opinion.
herndon
versus
lee
clearly
says
when
the
certificates
of
nomination
are
filed,
that's
the
day
upon
which
the
statute
begins
to
run.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well
the
statute
itself
says
five
days
after
the
announcement
of
candidacy
which
could
be
either
march
1st
or
may
7th
(voice
overlap).
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
no
--
yes,
filing
the
certificate
of
nomination
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
by
either
mass
meeting
or
by
convention
held
after
mass
meeting
by
delegates
nominated
at
the
mass
meeting.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
we
do
concede
that
it
was
not
filed
except
with
respect
to
certain
candidates
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
--
which
were
not
going
left
at
the
court.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes
sir
but
that's
not
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
there
was
no
need
to
file
it.
mrs.
amos
stated
the
record
references
on
this
are
record
80
--
67,
68,
82,
80
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
she
said
that
--
she
said
she
was
going
to
put
this
on
the
ballot.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes
which
is
september
6.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
under
that
case,
it
doesn't
because
nobody
ever
tried
this.
now,
what
she
said
on
september
the
10th
was,
and
we
could
--
the
record
replete
with
it.
she
says,
“you're
not
going
to
be
on
the
ballot
anyway.”
to
us,
that
renders
--
the
filing
of
anything,
nugatory
or
nullity.
we
immediately
came
back.
she
says
“you're
not
going
to
be
on
the
ballot.”
the
first
time
the
state
raised
the
question
was
in
court.
the
first
time
the
state
and
its
histories
raised
the
question
was
in
this
court
in
this
case.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
i
can
just
respond
as
judge
johnson
did
the
first
time
that's
enforcement
by
the
state
against
these
impecunious
defendants
who
if
the
campaign
contributions,
it's
of
mystery
to
me.
it's
really
rather
strange
under
equal
that
has
happened.
now,
what
happen
then
we
contend
is
that
we
did
comply
with
the
statute.
but
if
we
didn't
comply
with
the
statute,
we
say
dean
milk
and
other
cases
including
the
alabama
welfare
case
of
last
terms,
king
v.
smith,
the
least
drastic
alternative
does
not
destruct
them
for
the
ballot
because
in
the
first
place
all
they
say
is
after
five
days.
they
say
--
we've
got
an
alabama
case
that
says
if
you
don't
raise
it
by
private
party
that
is
not
raised
before
the
election,
not
only,
this
is
just
a
point
to
comment.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
we
represent
it
to
the
court.
the
court
said
on
16th
of
september,
it
issued
the
ordered
on
the
18th.
it
indicated
us
on
the
16th,
that
it
was
going
to
issue
in
order
to
making
as
candidates.
we
--
the
state
think
comes
in,
in
the
17th
and
said
we
didn't
file
it
by
the
10th
which
is
the
day
ms.
amos
said
you
don't
have
to
file
it.
we
then
said
to
the
court,
we
will
file
the
statement
immediately
upon
being
placed
upon
the
ballot
by
the
court
which
is
the
first
time
that
we
can
be
candidates.
indicated
that
to
the
court
before
the
temporary
restraining
order
was
issued,
the
court
issued
the
order,
we
then
filed
the
statement
within
two
days
thereafter
with
every
parties.
now,
we
think
that's
compliance.
the
second
thing
is
that
the
provision
--
yes?
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well,
the
date
of
filing
under
alabama
law
was
the
5th,
but
we
say
that
mrs.
amos
interrupted
our
statutory
period
when
she
says,
“we
can't
get
on.”
these
parties
represent
the
state
of
alabama
to
request
to
the
government
and
all
67
probate
judges.
now
our
second
contention
though
is
that
even
with
that,
we've
got
alabama
statute
that
say
if
you
don't
even
file
that
the
list
of
the
people
who
donate
to
you
before
the
election.
and
if
nobody
catches
you
before
the
election
then
that's
okay,
it's
just
directory
after
the
election,
it's
mandatory
before.
we
think
in
the
application
of
the
statute
certainly
is
in
violation
to
fifteenth
amendment
because
this
is
the
first
time
it's
going
to
applied
by
anybody
but
private
parties
in
court.
and
it's
been
applied
against
the
first
integrated
political
parties
that
have
come
along
in
alabama.
now,
some
point
was
made
with
respect
to
this
not
being
aimed
at
us,
being
aimed
to
republicans.
that
if
i
were
hunting
the
target,
i
would
say
the
target
might
have
been
those
groups
opposing
some
substantial
threat
throughout
the
state
of
alabama
office
holder-wise.
that
was
counsel's
statement
in
the
court
below.
now
i
can
just
refer
you
with
respect
to
that
statement
to
the
statement
in
button
here
for
one
of
you
and
i
don't
know
which
from
my
transcript
remark
that
even
republicans
have
constitutional
rights.
and
the
garrett
law
was
aimed
directly
at
somebody
in
this
case.
i
would
like
you
to
--
refer
you
to
the
amos
deposition,
exhibit
7
there
--
j
thereto
where
there's
a
letter
which
she
didn't
answer
which
says
in
close
“hi
mabel.
enclosed
are
the
150
party
emblems
per
your
request.
please
send
the
150
back
to
me,
the
ones
which
have
the
motto
marked
out.
congratulations
on
diligent
efforts
which
resulted
in
the
disqualification
of
some
liberals.”
now,
we
--
she
didn't
answer
that
letter.
we
just
contend
that
all
the
way
through
here,
we
did
everything
that
we
could
to
comply
with
the
law.
finally
she
says,
you
can't
be
candidates
again.
after
she
had
said
that
you
can't
be
candidates.
and
then
they
come
in
with
the
--
with
a
statute
which
we
say
is
unconstitutional
even
though
the
district
court
did
not
say
so
on
its
face
which
frank
johnson,
district
judge
said
was
applied
in
a
discriminatory
manner
under
yick
wo
versus
hopkins
which
was
applied
for
the
first
time
by
the
state.
all
other
cases
involving
private
parties
which
don't
involve
anything
corrupt
it
involves,
we
have
to
file
within
10
to
15
days
before
the
election
the
list
of
contributors,
and
then
another
one
within
15
days
after
the
election.
and
this
couldn't
apply
under
the
terms
of
the
statute
to
our
congressional
and
senatorial
candidates.
it
applies
to
candidates
for
state
office.
yet
they
are
disqualifying
everybody.
now,
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
no
sir
and
these
electors
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well,
it's
a
mystery
often.
i
voted
for
john
kennedy
in
1960,
when
11
electoral
votes
then
six
of
my
--
6/11
of
my
vote
went
up
for
harry
f.
byrd.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
they
are
unfledged.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well
i
still
vote
in
alabama.
i
have
a
--
i
own
a
house
in
alabama.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well,
that
maybe
it.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well
i
sort
of
i
wanted
a
declaratory
judgment
that's
the
one
vote
in
this
election.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
this
column
here
is
the
american
independent
party
of
alabama.
and
that
would
appear
on
49
other
states
as
george
wallace's
party.
but
he
captured
this
party
and
he
wants
to
capture
these
people
that
would
vote
for
this
ticket,
to
vote
for
these
nominees
and
he's
got
this
ticket
over
here
to
vote
for
hubert
hanford.
and
we're
asking
illiterate
voters
to
walk
into
a
polling
place
and
vote
the
straight
ticket,
one
or
across
this
ballot,
the
very
people
from
the
voting
rights
act
was
passed
after
a
hundred
years
of
--
the
promise
we've
had
with
this
problem
in
the
silence.
and
it's
with
respect
to
us
keeping
things
quiet
and
not
having
nominees
file
declaration
of
intent,
let
me
tell
you,
we
started
with
a
139
candidates.
now
they've
been
went
--
underway
to
89.
there's
a
little
evidence
in
here
of
the
fact
that
somebody
contacted
some
of
our
folks.
it's
not
very
easy
to
run
for
office
sometimes
in
alabama.
thank
you.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we're
back
today
in
a
matter
of
great
gravity
on
the
start
of
a
new
international
life,
even
though
it's
not
the
beginning
of
another
term
of
this
court.
theme
of
the
next
few
years
is
to
bring
us
together.
we're
confronted
today
with
a
question,
amongst
others,
which
directly
relates
to
section
148
of
the
alabama
code
in
both
its
aspects,
and
a
defendant,
judge
of
probate
from
the
state
of
alabama
named
james
dennis
herndon.
both
the
united
states
and
counsel
for
defendant
herndon
agree
that,
for
some
reason,
this
case
should
be
remanded
to
the
district
court
other
than
for
a
hearing
on
contempt.
it
is
this
court's
order
that
was
violated,
if
any,
by
defendant
herndon,
not
the
order
of
the
district
court.
this
case
is
comparable
to
ship
only
in
the
sense
that
this
court
is
much
more
clearly
involved
than
this
court
was
involved
in
ship.
the
gravity
of
the
case
in
ship,
of
course,
involved
a
lynching
in
the
loss
of
a
human
life.
in
this
case,
it
involves
what
we
consider
the
theft
of
the
right
to
vote.
regardless
of
the
evidence
in
the
case
which
quite
clearly
points,
we
believe
the
evidence
had
been
compiled
since
we
were
last
here,
which
quite
clearly
indicates
that
the
defendant
herndon
is
in
contempt
of
this
court's
order,
i
would
cite
to
you
the
first
part
of
section
148.
we
challenge
the
constitutionality
of
the
second
part
of
that
statute
which
states,
in
effect,
that
the
ballots
shall
not
be
printed
until
20
days
before
the
general
election.
the
defendant
herndon
received
a
copy
of
the
dissolution
of
the
order
of
the
lower
court
on
the
14th.
he
had
his
ballots
back
by
the
17th,
the
day
on
which
he
is
required
to
have
had,
by
name,
removed
from
the
ballot
by
alabama
law.
and,
in
his
haste
to
delete
the
names
of
the
negro
candidates
from
the
ballot,
he
not
only
violated
the
order
of
this
court,
but
violated
the
first
provisions
of
section
148.
since
this
last
election,
alabama
now
has
more
elected
negro
officials
than
in
any
other
southern
state,
72.
additionally,
one
--
more
official
has
been
appointed.
the
17
negros
elected
in
this
election
to
admittedly
minor
posts
by
the
ndpa,
equals
the
entire
number
of
negro
elected
officials
in
the
state
of
florida,
for
instance.
there
are
now,
in
the
south,
or
the
best
ascertainable
techniques
that
we
have,
384
negro
elected
public
officials.
there
maybe
up
to
400,
but
those
are
the
figures
of
the
southern
regional
council
voter
project.
during
these
four
years,
of
course,
we
concern
ourselves
in
the
south,
all
of
us
no
matter
which
side
of
the
particular
political
fence
we're
on
or
otherwise,
regarding
the
upcoming
life
that
we're
about
to
live.
for
a
number
of
years
in
the
south,
men
have
contumaciously
violated
the
orders
of
the
united
states
courts.
i've
been
involved
in
a
case
which
involved
a
man
standing
in
a
door
at
a
university.
we
have
witnessed
riots
in
mississippi
at
a
university.
we've
witnessed
overtly
contemptuous
acts.
we've
seen
district
judges
pilloried
and
others
too,
and
that's
free
speech
but
free
speech,
of
course,
stops
when
the
court
order
comes
and
you're
ordered
to
abet.
and,
the
defendant
herndon
in
this
case
was
faced
with
the
greatest
threat
a
man
in
greenecounty
public
office
could
be
faced
with,
no
doubt.
unlike
macon
county,
alabama
where
you
do
have
a
more
coalesced
movement
for
true
integration
in
politics.
in
greene
county,
the
probate
judge
found
himself
suddenly
faced
with
the
imminent
election
of
four
negros
to
the
five-man
county
commission
and
two
negros
to
the
five-man
county
board
of
education,
on
which,
one
negro
then
said
“this
is
not
a
large
county.
it's
a
small
county.”
there
are
not
a
lot
of
folks
there.
you
think
no
one
knew
each
other
to
read
the
depositions.
all
the
white
politicians
just
get
together
every
now
and
then.
there's
an
affidavit
in
the
record
now
that
says
“well,
i've
seen
them
play
dominos
almost
every
day,
but
they
just
sort
of
never
even
see
each
other.”
they
all
subscribed
to
newspapers,
but
nobody
seems
to
read
them
except
the
defendant
herndon,
and
he
did
admit
that.
they've
all
got
television
sets
and
they've
got
two
television
stations
they
receive
clearly
from
birmingham
and
one
from
oridion,
but
the
white
public
officials
just
didn't
know
anything
about
this.
but,
they
never
campaigned
for
office
this
time.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes,
sir.
it's
right
over
next
to
the
mississippi
line.
it's
in
the
area.
the
ndpa
candidates
were
elected
from
three
counties:
greene,
boarders
on
sumter,
and
marengo,
and
those
are
the
two
of
the
counties
where
they
did
elect
officials.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well,
i'd
say
it's
more
central.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
central
and
west.
it's
right
up
against
the
miss
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
sumter
is
next
to
mississippi
land
and
greene
is
next
to
sumter
and
that's
the
county
seats,
euta.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
67.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
euta.
now
--
and,
it's
a
very
small
town.
it's
a
couple
of
thousand
folks,
3,000.
it's
just
absolutely
inconceivable
that,
on
the
face
of
this
record,
a
deliberate
conscious
decision
was
not
made.
that,
in
the
line
of
past
history,
my
best
political
judgment,
i
can
hear
it
now,
is
to
stand
right
now
and
take
the
consequences,
leave
those
names
off
of
that
ballot.
now,
had
the
names
been
on
the
ballot,
there
were
1,938
straight
ticket
votes,
and
the
highest
white
candidate
got
1,709.
so,
he
was
right
in
this
judgment.
he
would've
been
serving
with
four
negro
public
officials
on
the
county
governing
body.
now,
this
is
the
county
where
the
greatest
risk
occurred
because
this
is
where
the
ndpa
have
the
number
of
candidates
running
for
the
county
governing
body.
that
was
most
important.
in
nearby
sumter,
they
had
a
man
running
for
the
chairmanship
of
the
board
of
education
who
got
elected.
i
recall
the
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
the
reasons
to
--
to
give
his
reasons
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
that's
--
that,
of
course,
the
only
reason
we
have
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
right,
and
he
has
several
reasons.
he's
assigned.
he
says,
first,
that
he'd
read
the
newspapers,
he
saw
the
order
was
reinstated,
knew
something
about
it
but
he
didn't
know
that
it
applied
to
the
local
candidates,
that
he
didn't
think
he
was
covered
by
a
court
order
and
that
none
was
served
on
him
personally,
that
he
wasn't
represented
in
these
proceedings
before,
and
that
he
wasn't
a
party-defendant
to
these
proceedings
before,
that
he
didn't
have
actual
or
constructive
knowledge
of
the
order
of
this
court,
that
he
did,
as
he
says,
read
something
about
it
but
he
just
didn't
understand
it.
now,
in
alabama,
you
don't
have
to
be
a
lawyer
to
be
a
judge
of
probate,
but
it
just
happens
that
judge
herndon
is
a
lawyer.
and,
it
just
happens
that
judge
herndon
was
also
the
herndon
in
the
case
of
herndon
versus
lee
which
was
the
last
election
case
in
greene
county
and,
in
greene
county
in
1966,
the
fifth
circuit
stayed
the
general
election.
and,
the
sheriff
there,
whose
name
is
lee,
is
still
in
office
not
by
virtue
of
election,
but
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
the
matter
still
been
stayed
and
there's
been
no
election.
and
the
situation
we
find
ourselves
in
now
is
we're
right
back
in
the
same
place,
where
all
of
a
sudden,
one
of
the
parties
in
herndon
versus
lee,
the
same
james
dennis
herndon.
and,
james
dennis
--
on
the
printing
of
the
ballot,
by
the
way,
on
the
section
that
we're
talking
about
148,
under
section
145,
talking
about
the
printing
of
the
ballot,
the
case
of
herndon
versus
lee
is
cited
there
again
for
the
proposition
that,
up
to
20
days
before
the
election,
a
man
has
a
right
to
remove
his
name
from
the
ballot.
i'm,
of
course,
arguing
from
the
--
from
what
i
think
is
clear
from
the
facts
and
circumstances.
he
has
--
i
think
i
pretty
well
summarized
it.
he's
given
varying
reasons
for
not
doing
it.
i
think,
perhaps,
they
can
be
made
to
sound
consistent,
but
i
don't
say
--
i
don't
think
that
they
are.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
there
are
issues
of
fact
involved
in
this,
and
i
think
it
pretty
well
boils
down
subjectively
to
what
did
he
do.
depositions
have
been
taken
from
everybody,
except
--
we've
offered
affidavits
of
four
of
our
candidates,
plus
a
fifth
person.
we've
not
offered
affidavits
of
two
candidates,
one
of
whose
--
we've
got
this
on
christmas
eve
and
our
candidates
will
get
back
on
to
the
christmas,
late
christmas.
and,
we
didn't
have
one
candidate,
who
was
then
ill
in
chicago,
is
now
ill
down
there,
the
chairman
of
the
party,
he
was
not
a
candidate.
but
the
two
board
of
education
candidates,
i
think
one
signed
a
committed
suicide
or
something.
we
just
couldn't
make
that
avail.
we
have
taken
depositions
in
the
district
court,
a
number
of
depositions
and
the
united
states
has
taken
a
number
of
depositions
also,
and
they
have
been
forwarded
to
this
court
by
order
of
the
district
court.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
no,
sir.
the
united
states,
in
the
district
court,
filed
proceedings
there
to
enjoin
the
white
candidates
from
assuming
office
and,
in
those
proceedings
in
this
case,
the
district
court
entered
an
order
with
the
consent
of
the
defendants
on
december
20
enjoining
them
from
taking
office.
most
of
the
depositions
were
taken
at
that
time
and
prior
to
that
december
20
order,
the
deposition
of
defendant
herndon
was
taken,
he
being
fully
advised
of
his
constitutional
rights,
as
i
recall
it,
after
that
order
was
entered
or
around
that
same
time,
and
it
was
then
forwarded
to
the
others,
also
with
the
understanding
in
the
record
that
it
would
be
sent
and
forwarded
to
this
court.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well,
sir,
i
think
it
would
be
convenient
to
be
able
to
say
so.
i
think
that's
the
position
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
i
don't
think
that--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
no,
that
was
dissolved
by
the
three-judge
district
court.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
so,
we
are
talking
about
direct
appeal.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
to
the
proceedings.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
the
proceedings
were
these.
we
went
in
and
we
took
the
words
of
mr.
justice
stewart's
order
in
william
v.
rhodes,
pretty
much
wrote
an
order
that
way,
got
a
restraining
order
--
a
temporary
restraining
order
out
the
district
court
on,
as
i
recall
it,
september
18.
it
was
then
dissolved
on
about
october
11.
it
was
dissolved
on
the
10th
but
wasn't
filed
until
the
11th.
we
were
here
on
the
12th.
we
then
came
back
on
the
14th
and
on
that
day,
as
i
recall
it,
you
restored
the
order
and
the
way
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
restore
--
restoration
of
temporary
relief,
i'm
not
quite
sure
how
we
titled
it.
what
we
asked
for
was
to
have
the
original
order
of
the
district
court
reinstated.
but,
of
course,
the
district
court,
by
then,
it
dissolved
its
own
order.
so,
what
you
did
was
you
reinstated
the
order
and
then,
on
the
18th,
we
had
argued
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
i
--
it's
a
very
short
page.
i
can
find
it.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
no,
“temporary
relief
was
restored,”
i
think
were
the
words.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well,
i
don't
think
it
does
but,
even
if
it
did,
it
wouldn't
matter
because
in
ship
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
no.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
because
i
think
merrimack
--
the
merrimack
case
clearly
says
that
just
because
jurisdiction
is
in
another
court,
it
doesn't
mean
it's
not
also
here
for
contempt,
and
the
same
thing
is
true
in
the
ship
case.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
sure.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
if
it's
the
order
of
both,
i'd
suggest
that
that,
as
far
as
judicial
administration
is
concerned,
that
this
court
should
speak
to
the
question.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
because
i
think
it's
been
the
contempt
of
this
court.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
it
surely
would
be,
yes.
you
could
be
in
contempt
of
both
orders
--
the
orders
at
the
same
time
but
i
think,
technically
speaking,
it
dissolved
the
order.
i
think
the
district
court
might
very
well
be
a
proper
place
to
gather
evidence.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
in
ship,
it
was
done
by
a
commissioner.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
oh,
yes,
sir,
you
can
say
that.
now,
section
148,
again,
has
an
additional
sentence
that
this
--
the
history
of
this
section,
it
begins
about
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well,
i
think
i
have
to
take
that
position
because
i
really
think
that's
what
it
is.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
that's
what
i
think
it
is.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
i
couldn't
hear
you.
i'm
sorry,
sir,
the
last
part?
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes,
sir.
i
believe
that
the
order
should
issue
here
and
the
policy
reasons
that
i
believe
and
disagree,
i'm
sure,
with
the
solicitor
general,
and
with
many
others.
the
reason
i
think
the
order
should
issue
here
is
because
i
think
that
this
court
sets
the
pace
for
every
district
court
in
the
south
and
crossed
the
line,
and
i
believe
that
this
court
should
show
the
way.
now,
another
sentence
in
section
148,
which
we've
attacked
the
constitutionality
of,
and
that
is
the
last
sentence
which
says
that
a
person
cannot
appear
on
the
“more
than
one
party”
label
or
emblem
on
the
ballot.
name
cannot
appear
twice.
well,
this
sentence
was
added
to
the
alabama
statute,
which
previously
contained
no
sole
--
the
“no
such
prohibition.”
in
the
year
1909,
it
was
added
by
--
by
amendment
following,
of
course,
the
disenfranchisement
of
negro
voters
in
the
south.
primary
came
into
existence
in
alabama
about
1903.
alabama
used
literacy
tests,
property
qualifications,
and
we
also
had
a
grandfather
clause
of
a
type.
we
called
it
abiding
grandfather
clause.
it
fought
many
wars,
it'd
come
along.
just
preceding
that,
in
1892
in
alabama,
there
was
great
political
turmoil.
reuben
f.
cobb
was
running
on
the
populous
ticket.
coalitions
and
infusion
were
taking
place
all
across
the
south.
1894,
you
have
the
same.
cobb
lost
by
11,000
votes.
1894,
he
lost
by
a
greater
margin.
in
1896,
you
recalled
that
william
jennings
bryan
was
nominated
by
two
political
parties
for
president,
by
three
really.
i
think
the
free
silver
republicans
were
with
him
also.
and,
at
that
time,
there
was
a
dispute
over
who
would
be
vice
president.
the
democrats
nominated
sewall,
the
republic
of
the
populous
nominated
tom
watson.
the
fusion
movement
in
the
south
at
that
time,
somewhat
different
from
in
new
york
and
the
rest
of
the
country,
the
fusion
movement
offered
an
opportunity
for
him
on
our
political
party
to
attempt
to
reach
out
to
bring
negro
voters
into
its
grasp.
and,
in
those
elections
in
alabama,
there
was
competition
for
the
negro
vote.
there
was
racism.
it
resulted
in
--
after
the
elections
of
1896
in
north
carolina.
it
resulted
in
the
terrified
political
problem
to
a
number
of
urban
southerners
and
a
number
of
populous
because
there
were
about
1,000
elected
negro
officials
in
the
state
of
north
carolina
in
the
year
1896
and,
in
that
context,
the
populous
party
went
down
to
destruction.
now,
this
political
movement
in
this
state,
with
section
148
on
the
ballot,
cannot
accomplish
fusion.
they
cannot
win
a
democratic
primary
election,
and
the
practical
reason
they
can't
win
the
primary
election
is
because,
by
the
state's
own
documents,
approximately
one-third
of
the
voters
in
alabama
now
are
illiterate
or
semi-illiterate.
and,
if
you
walk
into
a
polling
place
in
the
primary
election,
the
ballots
are
arranged
differently
at
each
polling
place
by
alphabet.
so,
consequently,
you
have
to
walk
in
and
mark,
and
mark,
and
mark.
these
same
candidates
here
run
once
and
lost
then
come
back
and
win
again
when
they
could
vote
a
straight
ticket,
and
if
you
cannot
combine,
in
alabama,
you're
not
going
to
be
able
for
this
--
to
have
this
party
move
out
in
an
integrated
effort
to
bring
forward
the
best
candidates
it
can
find
from
our
political
parties,
as
well
as
from
its
own.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
your
order
in
the
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
it's
not
in
the
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
it
must
be
in
the
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
got
it.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
it's
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
here
it
is.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
it
says
the
order
restoring
temporary
relief
is
continued
pending
action
upon
the
jurisdictional
statement.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
there
was
one
that
preceded
that
on
the
14th,
and
that
was
the
one
that,
i
think,
restored
custody
of
the
same
order.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
we
found
that,
too.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well,
i
think
we're
talking
about
both.
well,
i
think
we're
talking
about
both
of
them,
sure.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
that's
right.
so,
i
reckon,
we're
talking
about
order
of
the
14th
which
was
restored
by
the
order
of
the
19th,
and
that
at
least
gets
us
the
one
order.
in
the
--
people
--
section
148's
last
phrase,
which
we
do
have
under
attack
here,
which
we
have
under
attack
as
a
declaratory
judgment,
and
i
think
it's
very
important
to
think
in
terms
of
williams
v.
rhodes
and
the
problems
of
the
administration
of
the
law
as
far
as
the
future
is
concerned
so
that
there
don't
have
to
be
later
election
cases
brought
on
the
eves
of
elections,
so
that
matters
can
be
adjudicated
long
enough
in
advance
so
that
people
will
know
what
they're
doing.
but,
i'll
just
point
out
to
you
that,
in
1960,
we've
heard
a
great
deal
of
talk
--
we
heard
a
great
deal
of
talk
in
this
election
about
the
electoral
pillage
but
1960,
had
it
not
been
for
the
liberal
party
in
line
in
new
york,
john
kennedy
would
not
have
carried
new
york.
and,
had
john
kennedy
not
carried
new
york,
the
15
electoral
votes
that
went
to
harry
burke,
6
from
alabama,
8
from
mississippi,
and
1
from
a
defaulting
republican
elector
in
oklahoma
would've
been
sufficient
then
to
have
thrown
the
election
into
the
house,
and
then,
to
have
thrown
also
into
the
electoral
college
preceding
that
time.
there's
no
reason
for
the
restriction
that
i
can
find,
for
the
anti-fusion
movement
other
than
to
restrict
the
actions
of
third-parties
in
the
same
manner
that
was
condemned
in
williams
versus
rhodes.
the
party
cannot
place
the
names
of
other
nominees
on
the
ballot,
and
it
finds
itself
in
deep
difficulty.
in
this
case,
of
course,
we
find
that
with
respect
to
the
electoral
vote
and,
incidentally,
it's
quite
important
with
respect
to
that
vote
for
the
matters
to
be
adjudicated.
we
have
some
very
real
problems
here
with
respect
to
the
primary
law
in
the
state
of
alabama
which
allows
you
to
have
a
primary
if
you
have
a
20%
vote
in
any
county.
in
this
last
election,
the
ndpa
got
more
than
20%
of
the
votes
for
office
countywide
in
12
counties.
the
combined
vote
of
electors,
aidp
and
ndpa
electors,
would
have
allowed
an
additional
12
counties
to
allow
us
to
come
into
the
primary
law
and
have
this
own
party
--
to
have
its
own
primaries
in
the
future.
in
short,
it
covers
the
rest
of
my
time
and
simply
say
that
we
feel
that
the
vindication
of
this
court's
order
requires
the
defendant
we
required
to
show
cause
why
he
should
not
be
held
in
civil
or
criminal
contempt.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
may
it
please
the
court.
to
go
directly
to
the
question
of
judge
herndon's
notice,
i
would
like
to
cite
you
to
the
deposition
which
is
here
in
this
court
of
judge
herndon's.
judge
herndon
testifies
elsewhere
other
than
page
60,
of
which
i
now
am,
that
he
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
there
is
no
printed
record
and
there's
--
the
appendix
to
the
government
and
to
us
contain
only
sundry
references
and
we're
allow
to
proceed
to
forward
without
a
printed
record
and
ask
the
clerk
if
we
should
file
a
printed
record
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
and
they
said
“no,
not
at
this
stage
at
least.”
so,
we
refer
throughout
the
--
throughout
the
briefs
and
also
here
the
depositions
which
have
been
filed
by
the
court
after
motion
having
filed
below
therefore.
and,
in
the
herndon
deposition,
it's
quite
clear
that
he
does
subscribe
in
two
newspapers.
he's
the
only
person
of
these
candidates
who
admitted
that
he
read
the
tuscaloosa
news
is
one,
the
birmingham
post
is
another,
and
he
could've
read
either
one
of
them.
mr.
dunbar
with
the
department
of
justice,
at
page
61,
reads
to
him
from
the
article
and
it
states
explicitly
this,
“the
us
supreme
court,
friday,
will
hear
an
appeal
from
the
national
democratic
party
of
alabama
to
get
its
89
candidates
placed
on
the
state's
november
5
ballot.
however,
the
attorney
general
macdonald
gallion
was
told
friday.
now
then,
would
you
read
this
other
paragraph
on
the
second
page
starting
with
an
“agreeing
to
hear”?
answer:
“in
agreeing
to
hear
the
case,
the
supreme
court
granted
restoration
of
an
original
order,
issued
before
last
week's
montgomery
hearing,
that
prohibited
the
states
from
excluding
any
candidates
already
printed
on
the
ballot.”
on
the
next
page,
the
tuscaloosa
news
article
says
approximately
the
same
thing.
we
can
move
further
than
that
and
find
that
the
greene
county
democrat,
the
official
organ
in
which
judge
herndon,
as
probate
judge,
advertises
for
the
county.
contains
an
article.
now,
in
that
case,
it's
very
strange
because
the
very
man
who
printed
the
article,
the
publisher
and
editor
of
the
paper,
said
he
didn't
read
it
either.
a
question
came
up
earlier
about
the
record,
by
mr.
justice
white,
with
respect
to
whether
or
not
these
matters
were
at
issue
as
to
the
application
of
the
corrupt
practices
act
in
the
lower
court.
on
page
55
(a)
of
the
amicus
curiae
of
united
states
brief
herein,
you
will
find
the
representations
made
by
the
state
and
their
answer
below
regarding
the
disqualification
of
all
candidates
from
greene
county
and
referring
thereto
to
some
attached
exhibits,
j,
k,
and
l.
those
exhibits
are
found
in
the
record
of
this
court,
again,
not
printed.
exhibit
j,
page
307,
an
affidavit
from
judge
james
dennis
herndon
in
greene
county,
he
lists
the
names
of
the
ndpa
candidates
who
were
left
off
the
ballot,
and
at
the
conclusion
of
that
affidavit,
he
sates
“none
of
the
six
above
named
candidates
filed
or
offered
to
file
in
my
office
the
name
or
names
of
persons
selected
to
receive,
disburse,
audit,
and
expend
campaign
funds,
as
required
by
section
274
of
title
17
code
of
alabama,
etcetera,
within
the
required
five-day
period
nor
has
such
been
filed
to
this
date,
signed
september
20.”
if
you
then
return
to
the
brief
of
the
united
states,
you
will
find
there
as
appendix
e,
page
60
(a),
a
qualification
blank
of
the
type
that
has
been
filed
with
this
court
which
was
filed
by
these
candidates
in
the
democratic
primary
election.
with
respect
to
the
corrupt
practices
act,
these
six
candidates,
before
march
1,
1968,
stated
on
page
61
(a)
“i
hereby
certify
and
declare
that
i
appoint
myself
and
hereby
accept
the
appointment
as
the
sole
and
only
person
or
committee
to
receive,
expend,
audit,
and
disperse
all
moneys,
etcetera.”
now,
there
are
several
questions
about
the
case.
there's
one
unfamiliar
with
alabama
politics
and
i'm
thinking
now
particularly
about
mr.
justice
white's
comments
regarding
the
ohio
primary
election
and
its
effective
of
winnowing
down
candidacies
and
its
good
effect
in
that
sense
and,
certainly,
the
state
has
an
interest
in
doing
so.
the
state
here
makes
no
point.
it
was
improper
for
any
of
these
people
to
run
in
the
democratic
primary
election
and,
at
the
same
time,
to
receive
the
nominations
at
a
mass
meeting.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
on
page
22
of
their
brief,
they
concede
that
it's
not
improper.
surely,
it's
not
improper
because
they've
learned
from
history
in
alabama
the
election
in
macon
county,
where
sheriff
lucius
amerson
ran.
he
had
three
white
opponents
it
in
1966.
he
got
around
to
the
--
after
winning
the
primary
election
there,
at
the
end
of
1966,
one
of
his
white
candidates
had
a
write-in
campaign.
the
other
appeared
on
the
ballot
under
third
party
for
america,
inc.
the
same
thing
happened
in
selma,
alabama.
after
jim
clark
lost
in
the
primary,
he
ran
again
in
the
general
election.
some
question
has
been
raised
here
about
mootness.
yes,
sir?
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
did
not
decide
it,
three
--
and
our
problem
there
is
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well,
we
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well,
they
didn't
decide
any,
as
they
say
in
the
opinion,
complex
factual
issues
involved.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well,
with
respect
to
whether
they
filed
or
not,
it
would've
been.
and,
quite
frankly,
at
that
point,
we
relied
--
what
we
did,
and
this
appears
from
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
of
the
garret
law?
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
certainly,
or
its
illegality.
it's
not
applicability
under
section
5.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
my
position
at
that
point?
my
position
then
would
be
that
there's
nothing
in
the
statement
file
--
first
of
all,
these
forms
were
obtained
in
the
office
of
the
judge
of
probate.
they
were
provided
to
them
by
judge
herndon.
he
gave
them
the
forms.
now,
they
are
democratic
party
forms,
but
they
do
not
specify
in
the
corrupt
practices
part
of
the
form
that
they
are
merely
running
in
the
democratic
primary.
now,
the
form
is
the
form
--
the
form
simply
says
what
it
says.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
i
would
say
that
they
filed.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well,
i
would
say
then,
by
september
5
when
they
finally
filed,
the
statutory
period
began
to
run.
the
secretary
of
state
had
until
a
letter
was
written.
you
could
postmark,
on
the
9th
or
the
10th
would've
complied.
she
told
the
statutory
period
to
begin
with.
the
law
does
not
require
you
to
do
a
useless
act,
of
course.
and,
this
is
court
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
with
the
probate
judges?
i
think
she
spoke
for
the
probate
judges
and
i
think,
certainly,
in
the
case
of
these
six,
judge
herndon,
as
shown
by
past
acts,
that
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well,
in
the
record,
we
find
the
probate
judge's
do
contact
mabel
amos
and
we
do
set
out
in
brief,
almost
in
full,
a
letter
from
a
probate
judge
saying
“i
don't
think
this
is
worth
the
paper
it's
written
on,
and
i'm
going
to
contact
ms.
amos
about
this.”
and,
i
think
that
pretty
well
clears
for
the
record
that
it
butted
down
this
sort
of
works
together
in
matters
like
this.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
in
alabama?
i
think
that
sometimes
that
happens,
quite
often.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes,
sir.
the
state
of
alabama's
constructed
--
well,
yes,
you
do.
and,
the
state
of
alabama
in
the
case
of
herndon
versus
lee,
and
you
asked
a
question
a
moment
ago
about
what
kind
of
man
is
this
man
as
shown
from
the
record.
i
suggest
that
there's
an
excellent
series
of
cases
arising
out
of
greene
county
to
judge
this
man.
he's
been
a
party
in
a
number
of
cases.
the
case
of
herndon
versus
lee
is
the
case
with
respect
to
the
filing
of
these
corrupt
practices
act
statements.
as
we
say,
there,
the
shoe
was
off
the
other
foot
because
there
was
--
a
negro
can't
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
alright.
in
this
case,
well,
the
case
of
herndon
versus
lee
is
the
law
we're
referring
to
there
with
mr.
justice
white,
and
the
only
opinion
that
i
can
talk
to
you
about
of
alabama
law
interpreting
these
--
the
statutes
we're
involved
in,
and
it
simply
says
september
5,
the
date
to
file
with
probate
judges
or
with
the
secretary
of
state
the
sundry
certificates
to
go
to
different
places.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
no,
you
have
to
file
in
your
county
offices.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
in
the
probate
judge.
you
have
to
file
your
district
offices,
the
state
laws
--
courts
have
held,
in
all
offices
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
no,
that's
not
the
sole
position
we
take.
no,
sir.
no,
we
have
other
positions.
i'll
take
them
right
now.
that's
the
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
that's
a
position.
the
second
one
is
that,
in
fact,
the
--
when
the
secretary
of
state
acted,
when
she
acted
for
everybody,
the
second
is
that,
in
fact,
some
were
filed
in
our
--
across
the
state
and
that
these
complex
factual
issues
were
not
determined
by
the
district
court
as
to
who
had
and
who
had
not.
and,
thirdly,
we
return
back
over
to
the
same
probate
judges
who,
in
some
instances,
would
have
turned
us
down
to
determine
whether
we've
done
it
or
not.
fourth,
there's
no
hearing
in
alabama
law
granted
to
anybody.
fifth,
that
there
was
a
discriminatory
application
of
the
statutes
because
this
is
the
first
reported
case
where
someone
has
acted,
a
probate
judge,
on
his
own
initiative.
all
other
reported
cases
have
been
otherwise.
there's
an
unequal
application
statute
on
the
part
of
the
probate
judge's
and,
certainly,
on
the
part
of
the
secretary
of
state.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well,
judge
johnson
says
there's
been
a
policy
in
the
state
of
alabama
continuously,
in
his
dissent,
of
a
private
enforcement
of
the
statute,
never
public
enforcement.
never
before
has
anyone
moved
in
to
enforce
it.
and,
in
this
particular
case,
this
is
the
first
instance.
we
contend
it's
the
first
instance
because
it's
the
first
real
threat
that's
come
along,
at
least
of
latest,
since
this
act
was
there.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well,
our
only
precedent
is
the
dissenting
opinion
in
this
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
thank
you.
we
do
have
one
more
though,
and
that
is,
certainly
with
respect
to
greene
county,
i
think
your
resent
decision
in
glover
versus
san
francisco
railroad
company,
we
say
it's
not
necessary
to
use
as
that
by
going
to
a
labor
arbitrator
or
the
union
officials
when
you
know
you
can't
get
adjudication.
i
think
we've
got
something
in
this
record
that
might
show
us
we're
in
that
same
sort
of
position.
now,
the
question
of
mootness
was
raised.
the
classic
makes
it
quite
clear.
we
have
a
right
to
have
our
votes
counted,
and
i'm
talking
about
across
the
board
now,
not
just
greene
county.
we
have
a
right
to
hold
primary
elections
that
depends
upon
the
number
of
votes
that
we
got.
it's
a
declaratory
judgment.
we
need
to
decide
these
matters
now,
rather
than
in
a
later
time.
and,
the
district
court
opinion,
of
course,
does
uphold
and
did
rule
on
the
constitutionality
of
section
125
and
148
of
the
alabama
code,
as
well
as
the
garret
law
and
the
corrupt
practices
act.
the
relief,
a
question
was
asked
about
that
and
i
just
want
to
urge
that
the
relief
be
as
specific
as
possible.
but
you
know,
we're
talking
about
--
when
we
talk
about
primary
elections
in
greene
county,
just
remember
we're
talking
about
by
either
one
of
the
two
figures
we've
got,
127%
or
124%
of
the
white
population
of
the
county
is
registered
to
vote.
now,
we
know
that's
not
right
but
--
that
can't
be,
but
there
are
a
lot
of
names
there
that
don't
live
there.
accuse
anybody
with
respect
to
that,
but
i
just
say
that
they're
there
and
that's
one
of
the
criteria
the
attorney
general
uses
in
sending
examiners
in
and
observers
into
a
county
is,
have
they
purged
the
rules?
second,
primary
elections
are
run
by
the
local
democratic
party
folks,
always.
and,
in
those
elections,
there's
always
an
alternate
ballot
position
and,
in
this
case,
the
only
relief
we
have
so
far,
and
i
believe
after
the
three
mississippi
cases
were
argued
here
and
since
there's
such
concern
about
setting
aside
elections,
that
the
temporary
relief
of
this
court
could
quite
possibly
have
been
utilized
to
force
all
the
setting
aside
of
any
elections
and,
in
that
way,
not
go
back
and
disturb
anything.
but,
in
this
case,
the
only
relief
that
we
have
now
is
that
the
incumbents
are
in
office
and
hold
over
under
alabama
law,
and
the
sheriff's
been
holding
over
since
1966.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes,
i
think
a
new
election
--
first,
new
election.
i
think
certain
things
with
respect
to
the
order
by
a
new
election
should
be
done.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
if
we
accept
the
judge
--
the
contentions,
as
i
understand
them,
that
he
didn't
have
notice
or
the
alternative
contention
that
if
he
had,
he
didn't
understand
it
in
those
or
whatever
it
is.
under
those
circumstances,
i
think
they're
still
entitled,
of
course,
to
a
new
election
in
greene
county.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
if
the
court
decides
that
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
if
the
court
decides
that
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well,
i
think,
as
far
as
judge
herndon
is
concerned,
he's
still
in
contempt.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
i
don't
think
in
light
of
walker
and
i
don't
think
in
light
of
the
statement
in
carol
about
moving
forward
through
the
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
in
the
--
it
depends
on
what's
--
we're
talking
about
the
garret
law
and
corrupt
practices
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
held
it
constitutional
on
its
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
then,
in
that
case,
if
they
did
not
reserve
to
be
on
the
ballot,
and
you
can't
re-correctively
put
them
on
it,
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
judge
herndon's
contempt
but
it
has
something
to
do
with
whatever
relief
you
grant,
your
relief
that
they're
entitled
to.
i
do
want
to
point
out,
with
respect
to
section
125
on
election
officials,
that
this
record
does
disclose
that
there
were
120
election
officials
in
greene
county,
14
of
them
were
negros
and
81%
of
the
population
is
negro.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
no
--
which
one?
the
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
on
the
merits?
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
oh,
no.
on
the
constitutionality
of
the
corrupt
practices
act
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
no,
the
constitutionality
of
the
corrupt
practices
act
itself,
i
think
that
any
act
which
deprives
a
man
of
the
right
to
be
on
a
ballot
and
the
voters
who
could
vote
for
him
of
the
right
for
him
to
be
on
the
ballot
by
an
arbitrary
act
without
a
right
to
a
hearing.
there's
no
right
--
no
due
process
right
to
a
hearing
here
at
all.
the
probate
judge
says
he's
not
entitled
to
be
on
the
ballot
and
there's
no
statute
that
gives
him
a
right
to
go
in
and
get
on
the
ballot.
and,
at
this
instance,
it's
september
5.
i
just
don't
know
what
the
man
can
do
and
i
don't
see
how
that
can
be
constitutional
in
that
sense
of
the
corrupt
practices
act.
i
certainly
think
the
corrupt
practices
act
generally
should
be
and
are,
and
this
particular
provision
by
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
i
think
that
you
--
yes,
a
due
process
argument
independent
of
any
equal
protection
argument
at
all.
and,
secondly,
i
think
the
statute
itself,
by
its
very
wording,
is
really
rather
vague
as
to
what
it
does
say
and
it's
essentially
a
criminal
statute.
i
mean,
i
don't
know
that
you
can
read
that
statute
and
really
know
what
you're
supposed
to
do
because
i
know
that
you
can't
tell
what
day
you're
supposed
to
file.
if
you
don't
read
the
case,
you
can't
tell
because
it
doesn't
say.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
i
think
so,
yes.
it's
--
the
--
their
penal
sanctions
are
later
in
the
code
that
it's
a
violation
of
corrupt
practices
act,
they
can
go
at
it
that
way,
or
they
can
keep
him
off
the
ballot,
they
can
do
both.
i
really
have
nothing
more
if
there
are
no
more
questions,
except
to
say
that,
as
the
president
said
yesterday,
“the
laws
have
caught
up
with
our
conscience
and
what
remains
is
to
give
life
to
the
law,”
and
i
think
that's
what
this
case
is
really
all
about.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
we
have
here
behind
us
a
copy
of
the
alabama
ballot
as
it
appears
in
the
record.
this
is
a
reproduction
from
the
record,
exhibit
g
to
the
amos
deposition.
you'll
notice
on
the
seventh
columns
on
the
ballot
there're
eight,
some
independent
candidates
over
here.
in
column
1
you
have
eight
electors
only.
column
1
is
the
alabama
independent
democratic
party,
a
political
party
that
was
established
that
in
a
certificate
of
incorporation
states
the
party
shall
have
no
members
and
secondly
states
in
its
certificate
of
incorporation,
the
party
shall
ran
no
candidates
for
office
for
local
state
or
national
office
except
presidential
elector.
this
party
has
been
described
by
defendant
amos.
defendant
amos
is
herself
a
presidential
elector
candidate
on
column
number
3
as
a
party
within
a
party.
by
voting
on
column
number
1,
a
voter
cast
his
ballot
for
the
humphrey-muskie
ticket
for
president.
by
voting
column
number
3
he
votes
the
straight
democratic
ticket
in
the
state
of
alabama
and
thereby
cast
his
ballot
for
george
corley
wallace
for
president.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
ten.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
ten
electors
and
of
course
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
no
sir,
they
are
10.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes,
sir.
there
are
10,
and
this
column,
in
column
3
and
in
column
6
and
also
column
5
which
is
the
republican
column.
now
in
alabama
a
voter
if
he
votes
a
straight
democratic
ticket
votes
for
all
the
local
nominees
the
democratic
party
right
down
through
o'connor
and
others
all
the
way
down
the
line.
if
he
votes
for
straight
republican
ticket,
he
votes
of
course
with
mr.
nixon
and
mr.
agnew
and
all
the
way
down
the
line
he
votes
for
the
republican
nominees.
if
he
votes
this
party's
ticket,
the
national
democratic
party
of
alabama
were
appellants
here,
he
votes
a
straight
party
ticket
for
electors
pledge
to
humphrey-muskie
unless
disavowed
by
it
which
has
not
occurred.
he
also
votes
a
straight
party
ticket
down
the
line
on
those
counties
upon
which
candidates
appear
for
this
party.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
no
humphrey-muskie
here
in
column
3.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
that's
right.
in
column
1,
no
they're
not.
we
have
entered
into
a
stipulation
with
the
chairman
of
this
political
party.
and
under
alabama
law,
a
political
party
can
replace
vacancies
or
refill
vacancies
with
others.
and
in
the
event
section
148
of
the
alabama
statute,
title
17
which
prohibits
people
from
appearing
on
a
more
than
one
ballot
envelope
in
the
same
election.
that
in
the
event
that's
stricken
down
these
electors
will
be
removed
by
the
party
will
resign.
and
these
electors
will
then
move
over
so
there'll
be
no
dilution
of
the
humphrey-muskie
vote
in
the
state.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
they
can
be
if
the
court,
you
know,
allows
that
is
a
former
remedy
in
the
district
court
if
it's
so
instructed
here.
there's
no
physical
problem
with
that
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well
that's
in
section
148
simply
prohibits
them
appearing
on
the
ballot
twice
and
that
is
the
principle
statute
as
i
understand
that
would
prevent
them
from
being
aggregated.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
now
that
statute
coupled
--
a
week
it
became
that
statute
with
this
particular
election
is
certainly
unconstitutional
on
this
application.
it
may
not
be
unconstitutional
on
it's
face,
two
states
have
held
that
it
is,
one
state
of
new
york
of
course
has
held
that
in
almost
a
pre-close
course
of
the
voting
rights
act
has
said
that
a
party
may
nominate
whoever
it
pleases,
if
they
don't
withdraw
that's
all
right.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well,
not
really.
what
you
have
there
is
an
intervention
petition
for
citizens
from
the
local
citizens
for
humphrey-muskie.
in
there,
you
will
find
the
name
of
the
intervention
petition
of
one
of
the
three
co-chairman
david
j.
vaughn.
david
j.vaughn
is
the
chairman
of
this
political
party
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
edward
f.
malden
says
that
these
electors
should
be
removed.
these
should
be
left
on
the
ballot.
david
j.
vaughn
who
was
chairman
of
this
party
says
at
the
event
that
statute
is
brought
down
are
inapplicable.
these
electors
would
not
withdraw
a
place
on
this
ballot
here.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes.
mr.
vaughn
says,
who
is
chairman
of
this
party
has
represented
in
court,
its'
in
the
record,
that
these
parties
will
not
withdraw
these
electors
if
by
it's
on
the
ballot
under
this
ticket.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
now
you
have
a
second
provision
of
alabama
statutes
which
says
that
a
person
has
the
right
to
vote
a
straight
party
ticket.
two
provisions
of
law
that
provide
that,
this
is
a
voting
rights
act
state
of
course.
and
it's
been
determined
as
of
november
the
1st
1964
to
be
such.
i
don't
think
that
it's
too
difficult
to
say
that
this
ballot
is
fairly
confusing,
almost
a
test
or
device
to
illiterate
person.
if
an
illiterate
person
walks
in
he
can
flip
this
lever
here
then
he
has
the
one
roll
across
this
ballot
finding
whoever
he
wants.
if
these
candidates
are
not
on
the
ballot
he
will
find
few
of
any
negroes,
perhaps
one
or
two
running
for
constable
in
a
couple
of
counties.
this
ticket
under
column
7
has
of
course
a
substantial
number
of
negro
voters
and
candidates
on
it.
they
are
not
in
every
county
in
the
state
of
alabama.
there
are
not
very
many
negroes
in
some
counties
in
the
state
of
alabama.
we
started
with
the
sort
of
--
call
it
23
counties,
it
was
win
or
down
one
way
or
another
to
17
now.
we
believe
that
under
the
voting
rights
act
the
fifteenth
amendment
and
otherwise,
folks
have
a
right
to
vote
a
straight
party
ticket.
and
they
have
the
right
to
have
candidates
on
the
ballot.
we
also
believe
the
record
in
this
case
clearly
discloses
the
motive
and
the
reason
for
the
disqualification
of
this
party
in
column
number
7.
now
this
is
not
a
separatist
party,
this
is
an
integrated
party.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
i
take
it
only
on
ancillary
way
we
contest
the
other
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well,
i'm
not
making
it
directly
but
i
want
to
tie
it
back
in
a
moment
to
the
garrett
law
and
under
which
we're
disqualified
and
the
corrupt
practices
act
under
which
they
stay
we're
disqualified
i
can't
quite
understand
that
myself
and
to
tie
this
back
to
that
to
show
the
confusing
nature
of
the
ballot
and
move
it
forward
so
that
the
whole
procedure
looks
like
a
test
or
device
on
serving
those
statutes
are.
now
what
we
contend
with
respect
to
this
ballot
is
that
in
the
event
this
ticket's
not
on
the
ballot,
the
state
democratic
party
which
will
be
carried
by
the
wallace
electors
if
it
all
would
then
have
propped
into
the
political
system
from
which
negroes
have
been
excluded
for
a
hundred
years
the
negro
vote.
and
we
think
the
record
amply
discloses
the
way
that
this
whole
procedure
came
about.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
surely.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
temporary
restraining
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
nothing,
it
put
us
on
the
ballot.
it
put
this
column
7
on
the
ballot
that's
what
it
did.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
i
really
think
not.
you
see
it's
very
confusing
that
the
secretary
of
state
stated
herself.
she
didn't
quite
know
when
was
the
last
day
she
can
print
ballots
in
depositions.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
i
think
that
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
i
think
that
the
--
if
the
ballots
are
already
printed,
that
would
be
the
case
but
i
don't
think
the
ballots
are
printed.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
they
may
have
printed
absentee
ballots.
but
the
state
would
know
more
about
that
than
i
do
but
i
don't
believe
that
they
have.
i
believe
that
they
are
still
waiting
right
now.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes
sir
and
if
that
doesn't
happen,
of
course
we
want
this
column
7
electors
to
stay
on
there
as
they
are
now.
the
vice
president
and
mr.
muskie
have
made
no
election
not
to
appear
on
the
ballot
under
this
ticket.
mr.
wallace
did
that
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes,
sir
in
alabama
it
does.
it
would
put
him
in
a
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
because
they're
different
people,
because
the
candidates'
names
don't
appear
on
the
ballot
themselves.
but
what
we
contend
is
of
course
that
that
can
be
done
and
that
it
can
be
done
quite
simply
and
easily.
and
it
could
be
done
with
an
order
in
order
to
aggregate
the
votes
and
in
the
rights
we
have,
we
would
be
willing
to
waive
to
go
over
that
way.
but
we
do
think
that
certainly
illiterate
voters
have
a
right
to
walk
in
and
vote
the
straight
party
ticket
if
literate
voters
do
and
if
republicans
and
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
no,
not
really.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well
it's
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
that
--
well
they
need
two
things.
they
first
of
all
need
the
right
to
vote
a
straight
party
ticket
and
then
secondly
they
need
somebody
to
vote
for.
and
the
secretary
of
state
hasn't
given
them
that.
what's
happened
and
neither
the
district
court
order.
now
what
happened
was
along
about
august
14,
the
secretary
of
state,
re-exist
some
documents
the
best
evidence
of
which
according
to
the
district
court
was
an
affidavit
from
a
blind
man
saying,
that
he
happen
to
heard
the
mass
meeting
in
the
madison
county
courthouse.
she
relied
upon
that
and
said
that
this
party
could
not
appear
on
the
ballot.
on
september
5,
she
recounted,
said
the
party
could
appear
on
the
ballot
and
prior
to
that
time
and
public
statements
in
the
press.
following
that,
on
september
10,
she
says
“no,
you
can't
appear
on
the
ballot
except
for
two
candidates.”
by
september
13,
of
course
would
file
suit
and
we
were
endeavoring
at
that
time
to
get
here
by
the
time
of
williams
which
you
decided
too.
now,
she
is
of
course
the
secretary
of
state,
a
wallace
president
elector.
seven
of
these
presidential
elector
candidates
on
column
3
are
the
highest
state
public
officials
there
are.
two
others
are
the
wives
of
united
states
senatorial
candidates
and
i
forgotten
who
the
tenth
one
is.
now
in
this
particular
instance,
she
says
“no,
you
can't
get
on
the
ballot
because
you
missed
on
that
mass
meeting.”
we
took
voluminous
evidence
and
the
district
court
unanimously,
there's
no
question
about
this.
he
said
“no
mrs.
amos,
you
deprive
this
people
of
their
rights
to
equal
protection
under
the
laws
by
depriving
them
with
the
right
to
appear
on
the
ballot
on
the
basis
of
that
mass
meeting
and
you
mrs.
amos
must
pay
one-half
the
cost.”
now
she
had
a
second
ground,
she
denied
them
the
right
to
appear
on
the
ballot.
she
said
they
didn't
comply
with
the
garrett
law,
act
243
of
alabama
legislature.
and
the
garrett
law
simply
says
this.
it
says,
“you
must
file
a
declaration
of
intention
to
run
by
march
1st.”
that's
250
days
before
the
general
election.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
it's
made
up
in
a
form
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
it
just
says,
“i
hereby
declare
my
self
to
be
a
candidate
for
such
and
such
an
office
and
such
and
such
a
county
or
such
a
statewide
office
and
i
do
certify
that
i,
you
know,
intend
to
become
one.”
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well
one
says
nothing
apparently
in
alabama
because
you
see
again,
this
--
you
see
we
haven't
been
able
to
vote
a
full
ballot
in
alabama.
in
the
five
or
last
six
presidential
elections
because
we
always
have
electors
and
we
were
democrat.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
their
electors
file
declarations
of
intention.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
to
run
for
presidential
elector.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
no.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
not
on
the
form
that
they
file,
it's
my
recollection,
they
don't
--
they
could
but
i'm
not
certain
with
that
but
i
don't
think
they
do.
they
just
simply
file
as
republican
electors
and
folks
assume
that
they
are
vote
that
way.
now
the
democratic
--
column
3
electors
are
selected
differently.
they
run
in
the
primary.
they
run
as
pledged
to
wallace
and
run
in
this
date,
as
wallace
pledged
electors.
now
this
is
the
one
state
of
the
50
that
he
appears
on
the
democratic
ticket.
he
appeared
on
the
third
party
tickets
elsewhere.
now,
what
happens
here
is
exactly
parallel
to
williams.
exactly
with
respect
to
time
except
it's
250
days
in
alabama,
272
days
in
ohio.
now
the
second
problem
with
the
declaration
of
intent
statute
is
this.
there
are
a
lot
of
people
you
don't
--
who
don't
want
to
run
for
office,
first
if
you'd
have
a
declaration
of
intent
statute
nationally,
adlai
stevenson
would
not
have
been
the
democratic
nominee
in
1952.
he
couldn't
have
qualified.
if
he
was
in
fact
drafted
and
i
believe
he
was.
beyond
that,
there
are
number
of
people
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes
but
you
see
in
alabama
you
have
different
systems.
only
one
--
only
these
are
electors,
you
see
we
are
really
very
concerned
about
the
folks
down
the
ballot
too
because
we
are
running
people
for
a
local
and
state
office
in
local
county
boards
of
revenue
and
places
often
in
the
black
belt
areas
and
other
place.
we've
got
a
candidate
for
congress
running
in
the
district.
in
the
fifth
congressional
district,
william
mckinley
branch,
he
is
a
negro.
now
you
can
look
at
the
two
independent
candidates,
they're
both
white.
gibbs
is
white.
donaldson
is
white.
clovers
is
white.
there's
approximately
30%
negro
vote
in
that
district
and
day
before
yesterday,
the
northern
district
of
alabama
entered
an
order
allowing
college
students
to
register
in
tuscaloosa,
alabama
in
that
district.
it's
a
very
real
matter
to
that
congressional
candidate
who
is
a
negro
in
this
election
with
respect
to
prospects
of
being
elected
and
there
are
others
down
the
line
too
in
other
counties
for
board
of
education
post,
for
post
of
county
--
on
county
commissioners
and
these
folks
are
trying
to
seek
and
force
away
into
american
life.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
oh,
no.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
a
hundred
candidates
in
the
district
court
said
we
counted
89
as
i
recall
it.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
as
matters
now
stand,
they
are
in
the
order
but
they
wouldn't
be
without
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
two
would
be.
for
some
reason
as
the
district
court
says
in
its
majority
opinion
unexplained
to
them.
they
allowed
the
reverend
william
mckinley
branch
to
run
and
ms.
copeland
to
run
for
a
special
election
to
fill
a
vacancy
in
the
state
legislature.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
under
the
national
democratic
party
of
alabama.
now
this
party
of
course
--
know
that
party
in
alabama
does.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
only
two
candidates
in
the
place
and
we
are
not
even
sure
of
that
because
we've
been
turned
back
over
to
the
tender
mercies
of
mrs.
amos
and
67
white
probate
judges
of
the
state
of
alabama
by
the
majority
opinion.
and
we
don't
really
know
where
we
are
with
respect
to
it
or
where
we
will
be
with
respect
to
the
ballot
and
once
we
leave
this
court
if
we
go
back
to
the
majority
opinion
down
there,
we
don't
know
where
we
will
be
there.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
she
had
to
--
one
mass
meeting
was
wrong
and
the
declaration
of
intent
statutes,
you
made
that
quite
clear.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well
that's
right
and
certainly
that's
under
the
voting
rights
act
and
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
there's
no
need
to
get
to
his
constitutionality
unless
it
complies
with
section
5
or
--
and
4
(b)
of
the
voting
rights
act.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
it's
the
same
issue
i'd
say
that
you
are
in
the
button
case.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes,
sir.
the
others
have,
you
know,
reapportionment
figured
into
this
don't,
whitley
does
in
the
court
below
and
the
brief
below.
the
case
of
sellers
versus
trussell
has
been
cited
by
counsel
and
also
cited
by
the
court.
the
majority
pinion
is
somehow
authority
for
them.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes.
as
the
--
as
the
attorney
general
as
mr.
pollak
stated
the
other
day,
alabama
has
asked
for
approval
of
the
attorney
general
in
only
one
statute
that
was
in
november
1965
or
1966,
i
guess
it
was.
since
then,
they've
asked
for
none.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
they
haven't
asked
for
it,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
passed
in
1967.
and
of
course
this
affects
your
button
case
which
doesn't
involve
reapportionment
affects
of
candidacies.
this
affects
everybody
in
the
state.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well,
the
district
court
ruled
the
majority.
all
of
them
said
that
it's
constitutional
on
its
face.
it
requires
you
to
file
within
five
days
afterwards.
the
majority
says,
it's
constitutional
on
its
face
and
there
was
no
unequal
application.
judge
johnson
says,
there
is
an
unequal
application
under
equal
law.
he
says
that
there's
been
private
enforcement
constantly.
the
public
has
never
enforced
this
law.
public
officials
have
never
enforced
this
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
on
the
garrett
law
and
on
that
reason
to
the
ones.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
there
was
evidence
that
--
we
found
no
evidence
that
the
state
had
ever
enforced
it.
the
private
parties
had
always
enforced
it
all
the
way
through.
private
parties
would
go
in
and
follow
action
against
their
opponent
by
in
large.
their
opponent
then
would
intervene,
come
in
the
case
and
we
go
up.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes
we
are
--
it
was
filed
by
me
as
counsel
for
all
of
those
people
and
was
mailed
to
everybody
in
the
state,
every
probate
judge
within
two
days
after
the
order
was
applicable
with
every
candidate's
name.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
time
if
i
may.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
surely.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mrs.
amos
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
on
the
first
place.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes
sir.
herndon
versus
lee
is
relied
upon
as
the
law
of
alabama,
that's
relied
upon
in
brief,
that's
relied
upon
in
the
majority
opinion.
herndon
versus
lee
clearly
says
when
the
certificates
of
nomination
are
filed,
that's
the
day
upon
which
the
statute
begins
to
run.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well
the
statute
itself
says
five
days
after
the
announcement
of
candidacy
which
could
be
either
march
1st
or
may
7th
(voice
overlap).
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
no
--
yes,
filing
the
certificate
of
nomination
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
by
either
mass
meeting
or
by
convention
held
after
mass
meeting
by
delegates
nominated
at
the
mass
meeting.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
we
do
concede
that
it
was
not
filed
except
with
respect
to
certain
candidates
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
--
which
were
not
going
left
at
the
court.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes
sir
but
that's
not
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
there
was
no
need
to
file
it.
mrs.
amos
stated
the
record
references
on
this
are
record
80
--
67,
68,
82,
80
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
she
said
that
--
she
said
she
was
going
to
put
this
on
the
ballot.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes
which
is
september
6.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
under
that
case,
it
doesn't
because
nobody
ever
tried
this.
now,
what
she
said
on
september
the
10th
was,
and
we
could
--
the
record
replete
with
it.
she
says,
“you're
not
going
to
be
on
the
ballot
anyway.”
to
us,
that
renders
--
the
filing
of
anything,
nugatory
or
nullity.
we
immediately
came
back.
she
says
“you're
not
going
to
be
on
the
ballot.”
the
first
time
the
state
raised
the
question
was
in
court.
the
first
time
the
state
and
its
histories
raised
the
question
was
in
this
court
in
this
case.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
i
can
just
respond
as
judge
johnson
did
the
first
time
that's
enforcement
by
the
state
against
these
impecunious
defendants
who
if
the
campaign
contributions,
it's
of
mystery
to
me.
it's
really
rather
strange
under
equal
that
has
happened.
now,
what
happen
then
we
contend
is
that
we
did
comply
with
the
statute.
but
if
we
didn't
comply
with
the
statute,
we
say
dean
milk
and
other
cases
including
the
alabama
welfare
case
of
last
terms,
king
v.
smith,
the
least
drastic
alternative
does
not
destruct
them
for
the
ballot
because
in
the
first
place
all
they
say
is
after
five
days.
they
say
--
we've
got
an
alabama
case
that
says
if
you
don't
raise
it
by
private
party
that
is
not
raised
before
the
election,
not
only,
this
is
just
a
point
to
comment.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
we
represent
it
to
the
court.
the
court
said
on
16th
of
september,
it
issued
the
ordered
on
the
18th.
it
indicated
us
on
the
16th,
that
it
was
going
to
issue
in
order
to
making
as
candidates.
we
--
the
state
think
comes
in,
in
the
17th
and
said
we
didn't
file
it
by
the
10th
which
is
the
day
ms.
amos
said
you
don't
have
to
file
it.
we
then
said
to
the
court,
we
will
file
the
statement
immediately
upon
being
placed
upon
the
ballot
by
the
court
which
is
the
first
time
that
we
can
be
candidates.
indicated
that
to
the
court
before
the
temporary
restraining
order
was
issued,
the
court
issued
the
order,
we
then
filed
the
statement
within
two
days
thereafter
with
every
parties.
now,
we
think
that's
compliance.
the
second
thing
is
that
the
provision
--
yes?
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well,
the
date
of
filing
under
alabama
law
was
the
5th,
but
we
say
that
mrs.
amos
interrupted
our
statutory
period
when
she
says,
“we
can't
get
on.”
these
parties
represent
the
state
of
alabama
to
request
to
the
government
and
all
67
probate
judges.
now
our
second
contention
though
is
that
even
with
that,
we've
got
alabama
statute
that
say
if
you
don't
even
file
that
the
list
of
the
people
who
donate
to
you
before
the
election.
and
if
nobody
catches
you
before
the
election
then
that's
okay,
it's
just
directory
after
the
election,
it's
mandatory
before.
we
think
in
the
application
of
the
statute
certainly
is
in
violation
to
fifteenth
amendment
because
this
is
the
first
time
it's
going
to
applied
by
anybody
but
private
parties
in
court.
and
it's
been
applied
against
the
first
integrated
political
parties
that
have
come
along
in
alabama.
now,
some
point
was
made
with
respect
to
this
not
being
aimed
at
us,
being
aimed
to
republicans.
that
if
i
were
hunting
the
target,
i
would
say
the
target
might
have
been
those
groups
opposing
some
substantial
threat
throughout
the
state
of
alabama
office
holder-wise.
that
was
counsel's
statement
in
the
court
below.
now
i
can
just
refer
you
with
respect
to
that
statement
to
the
statement
in
button
here
for
one
of
you
and
i
don't
know
which
from
my
transcript
remark
that
even
republicans
have
constitutional
rights.
and
the
garrett
law
was
aimed
directly
at
somebody
in
this
case.
i
would
like
you
to
--
refer
you
to
the
amos
deposition,
exhibit
7
there
--
j
thereto
where
there's
a
letter
which
she
didn't
answer
which
says
in
close
“hi
mabel.
enclosed
are
the
150
party
emblems
per
your
request.
please
send
the
150
back
to
me,
the
ones
which
have
the
motto
marked
out.
congratulations
on
diligent
efforts
which
resulted
in
the
disqualification
of
some
liberals.”
now,
we
--
she
didn't
answer
that
letter.
we
just
contend
that
all
the
way
through
here,
we
did
everything
that
we
could
to
comply
with
the
law.
finally
she
says,
you
can't
be
candidates
again.
after
she
had
said
that
you
can't
be
candidates.
and
then
they
come
in
with
the
--
with
a
statute
which
we
say
is
unconstitutional
even
though
the
district
court
did
not
say
so
on
its
face
which
frank
johnson,
district
judge
said
was
applied
in
a
discriminatory
manner
under
yick
wo
versus
hopkins
which
was
applied
for
the
first
time
by
the
state.
all
other
cases
involving
private
parties
which
don't
involve
anything
corrupt
it
involves,
we
have
to
file
within
10
to
15
days
before
the
election
the
list
of
contributors,
and
then
another
one
within
15
days
after
the
election.
and
this
couldn't
apply
under
the
terms
of
the
statute
to
our
congressional
and
senatorial
candidates.
it
applies
to
candidates
for
state
office.
yet
they
are
disqualifying
everybody.
now,
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
no
sir
and
these
electors
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well,
it's
a
mystery
often.
i
voted
for
john
kennedy
in
1960,
when
11
electoral
votes
then
six
of
my
--
6/11
of
my
vote
went
up
for
harry
f.
byrd.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
they
are
unfledged.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well
i
still
vote
in
alabama.
i
have
a
--
i
own
a
house
in
alabama.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well,
that
maybe
it.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well
i
sort
of
i
wanted
a
declaratory
judgment
that's
the
one
vote
in
this
election.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
this
column
here
is
the
american
independent
party
of
alabama.
and
that
would
appear
on
49
other
states
as
george
wallace's
party.
but
he
captured
this
party
and
he
wants
to
capture
these
people
that
would
vote
for
this
ticket,
to
vote
for
these
nominees
and
he's
got
this
ticket
over
here
to
vote
for
hubert
hanford.
and
we're
asking
illiterate
voters
to
walk
into
a
polling
place
and
vote
the
straight
ticket,
one
or
across
this
ballot,
the
very
people
from
the
voting
rights
act
was
passed
after
a
hundred
years
of
--
the
promise
we've
had
with
this
problem
in
the
silence.
and
it's
with
respect
to
us
keeping
things
quiet
and
not
having
nominees
file
declaration
of
intent,
let
me
tell
you,
we
started
with
a
139
candidates.
now
they've
been
went
--
underway
to
89.
there's
a
little
evidence
in
here
of
the
fact
that
somebody
contacted
some
of
our
folks.
it's
not
very
easy
to
run
for
office
sometimes
in
alabama.
thank
you.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we're
back
today
in
a
matter
of
great
gravity
on
the
start
of
a
new
international
life,
even
though
it's
not
the
beginning
of
another
term
of
this
court.
theme
of
the
next
few
years
is
to
bring
us
together.
we're
confronted
today
with
a
question,
amongst
others,
which
directly
relates
to
section
148
of
the
alabama
code
in
both
its
aspects,
and
a
defendant,
judge
of
probate
from
the
state
of
alabama
named
james
dennis
herndon.
both
the
united
states
and
counsel
for
defendant
herndon
agree
that,
for
some
reason,
this
case
should
be
remanded
to
the
district
court
other
than
for
a
hearing
on
contempt.
it
is
this
court's
order
that
was
violated,
if
any,
by
defendant
herndon,
not
the
order
of
the
district
court.
this
case
is
comparable
to
ship
only
in
the
sense
that
this
court
is
much
more
clearly
involved
than
this
court
was
involved
in
ship.
the
gravity
of
the
case
in
ship,
of
course,
involved
a
lynching
in
the
loss
of
a
human
life.
in
this
case,
it
involves
what
we
consider
the
theft
of
the
right
to
vote.
regardless
of
the
evidence
in
the
case
which
quite
clearly
points,
we
believe
the
evidence
had
been
compiled
since
we
were
last
here,
which
quite
clearly
indicates
that
the
defendant
herndon
is
in
contempt
of
this
court's
order,
i
would
cite
to
you
the
first
part
of
section
148.
we
challenge
the
constitutionality
of
the
second
part
of
that
statute
which
states,
in
effect,
that
the
ballots
shall
not
be
printed
until
20
days
before
the
general
election.
the
defendant
herndon
received
a
copy
of
the
dissolution
of
the
order
of
the
lower
court
on
the
14th.
he
had
his
ballots
back
by
the
17th,
the
day
on
which
he
is
required
to
have
had,
by
name,
removed
from
the
ballot
by
alabama
law.
and,
in
his
haste
to
delete
the
names
of
the
negro
candidates
from
the
ballot,
he
not
only
violated
the
order
of
this
court,
but
violated
the
first
provisions
of
section
148.
since
this
last
election,
alabama
now
has
more
elected
negro
officials
than
in
any
other
southern
state,
72.
additionally,
one
--
more
official
has
been
appointed.
the
17
negros
elected
in
this
election
to
admittedly
minor
posts
by
the
ndpa,
equals
the
entire
number
of
negro
elected
officials
in
the
state
of
florida,
for
instance.
there
are
now,
in
the
south,
or
the
best
ascertainable
techniques
that
we
have,
384
negro
elected
public
officials.
there
maybe
up
to
400,
but
those
are
the
figures
of
the
southern
regional
council
voter
project.
during
these
four
years,
of
course,
we
concern
ourselves
in
the
south,
all
of
us
no
matter
which
side
of
the
particular
political
fence
we're
on
or
otherwise,
regarding
the
upcoming
life
that
we're
about
to
live.
for
a
number
of
years
in
the
south,
men
have
contumaciously
violated
the
orders
of
the
united
states
courts.
i've
been
involved
in
a
case
which
involved
a
man
standing
in
a
door
at
a
university.
we
have
witnessed
riots
in
mississippi
at
a
university.
we've
witnessed
overtly
contemptuous
acts.
we've
seen
district
judges
pilloried
and
others
too,
and
that's
free
speech
but
free
speech,
of
course,
stops
when
the
court
order
comes
and
you're
ordered
to
abet.
and,
the
defendant
herndon
in
this
case
was
faced
with
the
greatest
threat
a
man
in
greenecounty
public
office
could
be
faced
with,
no
doubt.
unlike
macon
county,
alabama
where
you
do
have
a
more
coalesced
movement
for
true
integration
in
politics.
in
greene
county,
the
probate
judge
found
himself
suddenly
faced
with
the
imminent
election
of
four
negros
to
the
five-man
county
commission
and
two
negros
to
the
five-man
county
board
of
education,
on
which,
one
negro
then
said
“this
is
not
a
large
county.
it's
a
small
county.”
there
are
not
a
lot
of
folks
there.
you
think
no
one
knew
each
other
to
read
the
depositions.
all
the
white
politicians
just
get
together
every
now
and
then.
there's
an
affidavit
in
the
record
now
that
says
“well,
i've
seen
them
play
dominos
almost
every
day,
but
they
just
sort
of
never
even
see
each
other.”
they
all
subscribed
to
newspapers,
but
nobody
seems
to
read
them
except
the
defendant
herndon,
and
he
did
admit
that.
they've
all
got
television
sets
and
they've
got
two
television
stations
they
receive
clearly
from
birmingham
and
one
from
oridion,
but
the
white
public
officials
just
didn't
know
anything
about
this.
but,
they
never
campaigned
for
office
this
time.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes,
sir.
it's
right
over
next
to
the
mississippi
line.
it's
in
the
area.
the
ndpa
candidates
were
elected
from
three
counties:
greene,
boarders
on
sumter,
and
marengo,
and
those
are
the
two
of
the
counties
where
they
did
elect
officials.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well,
i'd
say
it's
more
central.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
central
and
west.
it's
right
up
against
the
miss
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
sumter
is
next
to
mississippi
land
and
greene
is
next
to
sumter
and
that's
the
county
seats,
euta.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
67.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
euta.
now
--
and,
it's
a
very
small
town.
it's
a
couple
of
thousand
folks,
3,000.
it's
just
absolutely
inconceivable
that,
on
the
face
of
this
record,
a
deliberate
conscious
decision
was
not
made.
that,
in
the
line
of
past
history,
my
best
political
judgment,
i
can
hear
it
now,
is
to
stand
right
now
and
take
the
consequences,
leave
those
names
off
of
that
ballot.
now,
had
the
names
been
on
the
ballot,
there
were
1,938
straight
ticket
votes,
and
the
highest
white
candidate
got
1,709.
so,
he
was
right
in
this
judgment.
he
would've
been
serving
with
four
negro
public
officials
on
the
county
governing
body.
now,
this
is
the
county
where
the
greatest
risk
occurred
because
this
is
where
the
ndpa
have
the
number
of
candidates
running
for
the
county
governing
body.
that
was
most
important.
in
nearby
sumter,
they
had
a
man
running
for
the
chairmanship
of
the
board
of
education
who
got
elected.
i
recall
the
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
the
reasons
to
--
to
give
his
reasons
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
that's
--
that,
of
course,
the
only
reason
we
have
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
right,
and
he
has
several
reasons.
he's
assigned.
he
says,
first,
that
he'd
read
the
newspapers,
he
saw
the
order
was
reinstated,
knew
something
about
it
but
he
didn't
know
that
it
applied
to
the
local
candidates,
that
he
didn't
think
he
was
covered
by
a
court
order
and
that
none
was
served
on
him
personally,
that
he
wasn't
represented
in
these
proceedings
before,
and
that
he
wasn't
a
party-defendant
to
these
proceedings
before,
that
he
didn't
have
actual
or
constructive
knowledge
of
the
order
of
this
court,
that
he
did,
as
he
says,
read
something
about
it
but
he
just
didn't
understand
it.
now,
in
alabama,
you
don't
have
to
be
a
lawyer
to
be
a
judge
of
probate,
but
it
just
happens
that
judge
herndon
is
a
lawyer.
and,
it
just
happens
that
judge
herndon
was
also
the
herndon
in
the
case
of
herndon
versus
lee
which
was
the
last
election
case
in
greene
county
and,
in
greene
county
in
1966,
the
fifth
circuit
stayed
the
general
election.
and,
the
sheriff
there,
whose
name
is
lee,
is
still
in
office
not
by
virtue
of
election,
but
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
the
matter
still
been
stayed
and
there's
been
no
election.
and
the
situation
we
find
ourselves
in
now
is
we're
right
back
in
the
same
place,
where
all
of
a
sudden,
one
of
the
parties
in
herndon
versus
lee,
the
same
james
dennis
herndon.
and,
james
dennis
--
on
the
printing
of
the
ballot,
by
the
way,
on
the
section
that
we're
talking
about
148,
under
section
145,
talking
about
the
printing
of
the
ballot,
the
case
of
herndon
versus
lee
is
cited
there
again
for
the
proposition
that,
up
to
20
days
before
the
election,
a
man
has
a
right
to
remove
his
name
from
the
ballot.
i'm,
of
course,
arguing
from
the
--
from
what
i
think
is
clear
from
the
facts
and
circumstances.
he
has
--
i
think
i
pretty
well
summarized
it.
he's
given
varying
reasons
for
not
doing
it.
i
think,
perhaps,
they
can
be
made
to
sound
consistent,
but
i
don't
say
--
i
don't
think
that
they
are.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
there
are
issues
of
fact
involved
in
this,
and
i
think
it
pretty
well
boils
down
subjectively
to
what
did
he
do.
depositions
have
been
taken
from
everybody,
except
--
we've
offered
affidavits
of
four
of
our
candidates,
plus
a
fifth
person.
we've
not
offered
affidavits
of
two
candidates,
one
of
whose
--
we've
got
this
on
christmas
eve
and
our
candidates
will
get
back
on
to
the
christmas,
late
christmas.
and,
we
didn't
have
one
candidate,
who
was
then
ill
in
chicago,
is
now
ill
down
there,
the
chairman
of
the
party,
he
was
not
a
candidate.
but
the
two
board
of
education
candidates,
i
think
one
signed
a
committed
suicide
or
something.
we
just
couldn't
make
that
avail.
we
have
taken
depositions
in
the
district
court,
a
number
of
depositions
and
the
united
states
has
taken
a
number
of
depositions
also,
and
they
have
been
forwarded
to
this
court
by
order
of
the
district
court.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
no,
sir.
the
united
states,
in
the
district
court,
filed
proceedings
there
to
enjoin
the
white
candidates
from
assuming
office
and,
in
those
proceedings
in
this
case,
the
district
court
entered
an
order
with
the
consent
of
the
defendants
on
december
20
enjoining
them
from
taking
office.
most
of
the
depositions
were
taken
at
that
time
and
prior
to
that
december
20
order,
the
deposition
of
defendant
herndon
was
taken,
he
being
fully
advised
of
his
constitutional
rights,
as
i
recall
it,
after
that
order
was
entered
or
around
that
same
time,
and
it
was
then
forwarded
to
the
others,
also
with
the
understanding
in
the
record
that
it
would
be
sent
and
forwarded
to
this
court.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well,
sir,
i
think
it
would
be
convenient
to
be
able
to
say
so.
i
think
that's
the
position
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
i
don't
think
that--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
no,
that
was
dissolved
by
the
three-judge
district
court.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
so,
we
are
talking
about
direct
appeal.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
to
the
proceedings.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
the
proceedings
were
these.
we
went
in
and
we
took
the
words
of
mr.
justice
stewart's
order
in
william
v.
rhodes,
pretty
much
wrote
an
order
that
way,
got
a
restraining
order
--
a
temporary
restraining
order
out
the
district
court
on,
as
i
recall
it,
september
18.
it
was
then
dissolved
on
about
october
11.
it
was
dissolved
on
the
10th
but
wasn't
filed
until
the
11th.
we
were
here
on
the
12th.
we
then
came
back
on
the
14th
and
on
that
day,
as
i
recall
it,
you
restored
the
order
and
the
way
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
restore
--
restoration
of
temporary
relief,
i'm
not
quite
sure
how
we
titled
it.
what
we
asked
for
was
to
have
the
original
order
of
the
district
court
reinstated.
but,
of
course,
the
district
court,
by
then,
it
dissolved
its
own
order.
so,
what
you
did
was
you
reinstated
the
order
and
then,
on
the
18th,
we
had
argued
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
i
--
it's
a
very
short
page.
i
can
find
it.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
no,
“temporary
relief
was
restored,”
i
think
were
the
words.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well,
i
don't
think
it
does
but,
even
if
it
did,
it
wouldn't
matter
because
in
ship
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
no.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
because
i
think
merrimack
--
the
merrimack
case
clearly
says
that
just
because
jurisdiction
is
in
another
court,
it
doesn't
mean
it's
not
also
here
for
contempt,
and
the
same
thing
is
true
in
the
ship
case.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
sure.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
if
it's
the
order
of
both,
i'd
suggest
that
that,
as
far
as
judicial
administration
is
concerned,
that
this
court
should
speak
to
the
question.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
because
i
think
it's
been
the
contempt
of
this
court.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
it
surely
would
be,
yes.
you
could
be
in
contempt
of
both
orders
--
the
orders
at
the
same
time
but
i
think,
technically
speaking,
it
dissolved
the
order.
i
think
the
district
court
might
very
well
be
a
proper
place
to
gather
evidence.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
in
ship,
it
was
done
by
a
commissioner.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
oh,
yes,
sir,
you
can
say
that.
now,
section
148,
again,
has
an
additional
sentence
that
this
--
the
history
of
this
section,
it
begins
about
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well,
i
think
i
have
to
take
that
position
because
i
really
think
that's
what
it
is.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
that's
what
i
think
it
is.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
i
couldn't
hear
you.
i'm
sorry,
sir,
the
last
part?
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes,
sir.
i
believe
that
the
order
should
issue
here
and
the
policy
reasons
that
i
believe
and
disagree,
i'm
sure,
with
the
solicitor
general,
and
with
many
others.
the
reason
i
think
the
order
should
issue
here
is
because
i
think
that
this
court
sets
the
pace
for
every
district
court
in
the
south
and
crossed
the
line,
and
i
believe
that
this
court
should
show
the
way.
now,
another
sentence
in
section
148,
which
we've
attacked
the
constitutionality
of,
and
that
is
the
last
sentence
which
says
that
a
person
cannot
appear
on
the
“more
than
one
party”
label
or
emblem
on
the
ballot.
name
cannot
appear
twice.
well,
this
sentence
was
added
to
the
alabama
statute,
which
previously
contained
no
sole
--
the
“no
such
prohibition.”
in
the
year
1909,
it
was
added
by
--
by
amendment
following,
of
course,
the
disenfranchisement
of
negro
voters
in
the
south.
primary
came
into
existence
in
alabama
about
1903.
alabama
used
literacy
tests,
property
qualifications,
and
we
also
had
a
grandfather
clause
of
a
type.
we
called
it
abiding
grandfather
clause.
it
fought
many
wars,
it'd
come
along.
just
preceding
that,
in
1892
in
alabama,
there
was
great
political
turmoil.
reuben
f.
cobb
was
running
on
the
populous
ticket.
coalitions
and
infusion
were
taking
place
all
across
the
south.
1894,
you
have
the
same.
cobb
lost
by
11,000
votes.
1894,
he
lost
by
a
greater
margin.
in
1896,
you
recalled
that
william
jennings
bryan
was
nominated
by
two
political
parties
for
president,
by
three
really.
i
think
the
free
silver
republicans
were
with
him
also.
and,
at
that
time,
there
was
a
dispute
over
who
would
be
vice
president.
the
democrats
nominated
sewall,
the
republic
of
the
populous
nominated
tom
watson.
the
fusion
movement
in
the
south
at
that
time,
somewhat
different
from
in
new
york
and
the
rest
of
the
country,
the
fusion
movement
offered
an
opportunity
for
him
on
our
political
party
to
attempt
to
reach
out
to
bring
negro
voters
into
its
grasp.
and,
in
those
elections
in
alabama,
there
was
competition
for
the
negro
vote.
there
was
racism.
it
resulted
in
--
after
the
elections
of
1896
in
north
carolina.
it
resulted
in
the
terrified
political
problem
to
a
number
of
urban
southerners
and
a
number
of
populous
because
there
were
about
1,000
elected
negro
officials
in
the
state
of
north
carolina
in
the
year
1896
and,
in
that
context,
the
populous
party
went
down
to
destruction.
now,
this
political
movement
in
this
state,
with
section
148
on
the
ballot,
cannot
accomplish
fusion.
they
cannot
win
a
democratic
primary
election,
and
the
practical
reason
they
can't
win
the
primary
election
is
because,
by
the
state's
own
documents,
approximately
one-third
of
the
voters
in
alabama
now
are
illiterate
or
semi-illiterate.
and,
if
you
walk
into
a
polling
place
in
the
primary
election,
the
ballots
are
arranged
differently
at
each
polling
place
by
alphabet.
so,
consequently,
you
have
to
walk
in
and
mark,
and
mark,
and
mark.
these
same
candidates
here
run
once
and
lost
then
come
back
and
win
again
when
they
could
vote
a
straight
ticket,
and
if
you
cannot
combine,
in
alabama,
you're
not
going
to
be
able
for
this
--
to
have
this
party
move
out
in
an
integrated
effort
to
bring
forward
the
best
candidates
it
can
find
from
our
political
parties,
as
well
as
from
its
own.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
your
order
in
the
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
it's
not
in
the
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
it
must
be
in
the
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
got
it.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
it's
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
here
it
is.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
it
says
the
order
restoring
temporary
relief
is
continued
pending
action
upon
the
jurisdictional
statement.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
there
was
one
that
preceded
that
on
the
14th,
and
that
was
the
one
that,
i
think,
restored
custody
of
the
same
order.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
we
found
that,
too.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well,
i
think
we're
talking
about
both.
well,
i
think
we're
talking
about
both
of
them,
sure.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
that's
right.
so,
i
reckon,
we're
talking
about
order
of
the
14th
which
was
restored
by
the
order
of
the
19th,
and
that
at
least
gets
us
the
one
order.
in
the
--
people
--
section
148's
last
phrase,
which
we
do
have
under
attack
here,
which
we
have
under
attack
as
a
declaratory
judgment,
and
i
think
it's
very
important
to
think
in
terms
of
williams
v.
rhodes
and
the
problems
of
the
administration
of
the
law
as
far
as
the
future
is
concerned
so
that
there
don't
have
to
be
later
election
cases
brought
on
the
eves
of
elections,
so
that
matters
can
be
adjudicated
long
enough
in
advance
so
that
people
will
know
what
they're
doing.
but,
i'll
just
point
out
to
you
that,
in
1960,
we've
heard
a
great
deal
of
talk
--
we
heard
a
great
deal
of
talk
in
this
election
about
the
electoral
pillage
but
1960,
had
it
not
been
for
the
liberal
party
in
line
in
new
york,
john
kennedy
would
not
have
carried
new
york.
and,
had
john
kennedy
not
carried
new
york,
the
15
electoral
votes
that
went
to
harry
burke,
6
from
alabama,
8
from
mississippi,
and
1
from
a
defaulting
republican
elector
in
oklahoma
would've
been
sufficient
then
to
have
thrown
the
election
into
the
house,
and
then,
to
have
thrown
also
into
the
electoral
college
preceding
that
time.
there's
no
reason
for
the
restriction
that
i
can
find,
for
the
anti-fusion
movement
other
than
to
restrict
the
actions
of
third-parties
in
the
same
manner
that
was
condemned
in
williams
versus
rhodes.
the
party
cannot
place
the
names
of
other
nominees
on
the
ballot,
and
it
finds
itself
in
deep
difficulty.
in
this
case,
of
course,
we
find
that
with
respect
to
the
electoral
vote
and,
incidentally,
it's
quite
important
with
respect
to
that
vote
for
the
matters
to
be
adjudicated.
we
have
some
very
real
problems
here
with
respect
to
the
primary
law
in
the
state
of
alabama
which
allows
you
to
have
a
primary
if
you
have
a
20%
vote
in
any
county.
in
this
last
election,
the
ndpa
got
more
than
20%
of
the
votes
for
office
countywide
in
12
counties.
the
combined
vote
of
electors,
aidp
and
ndpa
electors,
would
have
allowed
an
additional
12
counties
to
allow
us
to
come
into
the
primary
law
and
have
this
own
party
--
to
have
its
own
primaries
in
the
future.
in
short,
it
covers
the
rest
of
my
time
and
simply
say
that
we
feel
that
the
vindication
of
this
court's
order
requires
the
defendant
we
required
to
show
cause
why
he
should
not
be
held
in
civil
or
criminal
contempt.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
may
it
please
the
court.
to
go
directly
to
the
question
of
judge
herndon's
notice,
i
would
like
to
cite
you
to
the
deposition
which
is
here
in
this
court
of
judge
herndon's.
judge
herndon
testifies
elsewhere
other
than
page
60,
of
which
i
now
am,
that
he
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
there
is
no
printed
record
and
there's
--
the
appendix
to
the
government
and
to
us
contain
only
sundry
references
and
we're
allow
to
proceed
to
forward
without
a
printed
record
and
ask
the
clerk
if
we
should
file
a
printed
record
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
and
they
said
“no,
not
at
this
stage
at
least.”
so,
we
refer
throughout
the
--
throughout
the
briefs
and
also
here
the
depositions
which
have
been
filed
by
the
court
after
motion
having
filed
below
therefore.
and,
in
the
herndon
deposition,
it's
quite
clear
that
he
does
subscribe
in
two
newspapers.
he's
the
only
person
of
these
candidates
who
admitted
that
he
read
the
tuscaloosa
news
is
one,
the
birmingham
post
is
another,
and
he
could've
read
either
one
of
them.
mr.
dunbar
with
the
department
of
justice,
at
page
61,
reads
to
him
from
the
article
and
it
states
explicitly
this,
“the
us
supreme
court,
friday,
will
hear
an
appeal
from
the
national
democratic
party
of
alabama
to
get
its
89
candidates
placed
on
the
state's
november
5
ballot.
however,
the
attorney
general
macdonald
gallion
was
told
friday.
now
then,
would
you
read
this
other
paragraph
on
the
second
page
starting
with
an
“agreeing
to
hear”?
answer:
“in
agreeing
to
hear
the
case,
the
supreme
court
granted
restoration
of
an
original
order,
issued
before
last
week's
montgomery
hearing,
that
prohibited
the
states
from
excluding
any
candidates
already
printed
on
the
ballot.”
on
the
next
page,
the
tuscaloosa
news
article
says
approximately
the
same
thing.
we
can
move
further
than
that
and
find
that
the
greene
county
democrat,
the
official
organ
in
which
judge
herndon,
as
probate
judge,
advertises
for
the
county.
contains
an
article.
now,
in
that
case,
it's
very
strange
because
the
very
man
who
printed
the
article,
the
publisher
and
editor
of
the
paper,
said
he
didn't
read
it
either.
a
question
came
up
earlier
about
the
record,
by
mr.
justice
white,
with
respect
to
whether
or
not
these
matters
were
at
issue
as
to
the
application
of
the
corrupt
practices
act
in
the
lower
court.
on
page
55
(a)
of
the
amicus
curiae
of
united
states
brief
herein,
you
will
find
the
representations
made
by
the
state
and
their
answer
below
regarding
the
disqualification
of
all
candidates
from
greene
county
and
referring
thereto
to
some
attached
exhibits,
j,
k,
and
l.
those
exhibits
are
found
in
the
record
of
this
court,
again,
not
printed.
exhibit
j,
page
307,
an
affidavit
from
judge
james
dennis
herndon
in
greene
county,
he
lists
the
names
of
the
ndpa
candidates
who
were
left
off
the
ballot,
and
at
the
conclusion
of
that
affidavit,
he
sates
“none
of
the
six
above
named
candidates
filed
or
offered
to
file
in
my
office
the
name
or
names
of
persons
selected
to
receive,
disburse,
audit,
and
expend
campaign
funds,
as
required
by
section
274
of
title
17
code
of
alabama,
etcetera,
within
the
required
five-day
period
nor
has
such
been
filed
to
this
date,
signed
september
20.”
if
you
then
return
to
the
brief
of
the
united
states,
you
will
find
there
as
appendix
e,
page
60
(a),
a
qualification
blank
of
the
type
that
has
been
filed
with
this
court
which
was
filed
by
these
candidates
in
the
democratic
primary
election.
with
respect
to
the
corrupt
practices
act,
these
six
candidates,
before
march
1,
1968,
stated
on
page
61
(a)
“i
hereby
certify
and
declare
that
i
appoint
myself
and
hereby
accept
the
appointment
as
the
sole
and
only
person
or
committee
to
receive,
expend,
audit,
and
disperse
all
moneys,
etcetera.”
now,
there
are
several
questions
about
the
case.
there's
one
unfamiliar
with
alabama
politics
and
i'm
thinking
now
particularly
about
mr.
justice
white's
comments
regarding
the
ohio
primary
election
and
its
effective
of
winnowing
down
candidacies
and
its
good
effect
in
that
sense
and,
certainly,
the
state
has
an
interest
in
doing
so.
the
state
here
makes
no
point.
it
was
improper
for
any
of
these
people
to
run
in
the
democratic
primary
election
and,
at
the
same
time,
to
receive
the
nominations
at
a
mass
meeting.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
on
page
22
of
their
brief,
they
concede
that
it's
not
improper.
surely,
it's
not
improper
because
they've
learned
from
history
in
alabama
the
election
in
macon
county,
where
sheriff
lucius
amerson
ran.
he
had
three
white
opponents
it
in
1966.
he
got
around
to
the
--
after
winning
the
primary
election
there,
at
the
end
of
1966,
one
of
his
white
candidates
had
a
write-in
campaign.
the
other
appeared
on
the
ballot
under
third
party
for
america,
inc.
the
same
thing
happened
in
selma,
alabama.
after
jim
clark
lost
in
the
primary,
he
ran
again
in
the
general
election.
some
question
has
been
raised
here
about
mootness.
yes,
sir?
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
did
not
decide
it,
three
--
and
our
problem
there
is
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well,
we
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well,
they
didn't
decide
any,
as
they
say
in
the
opinion,
complex
factual
issues
involved.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well,
with
respect
to
whether
they
filed
or
not,
it
would've
been.
and,
quite
frankly,
at
that
point,
we
relied
--
what
we
did,
and
this
appears
from
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
of
the
garret
law?
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
certainly,
or
its
illegality.
it's
not
applicability
under
section
5.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
my
position
at
that
point?
my
position
then
would
be
that
there's
nothing
in
the
statement
file
--
first
of
all,
these
forms
were
obtained
in
the
office
of
the
judge
of
probate.
they
were
provided
to
them
by
judge
herndon.
he
gave
them
the
forms.
now,
they
are
democratic
party
forms,
but
they
do
not
specify
in
the
corrupt
practices
part
of
the
form
that
they
are
merely
running
in
the
democratic
primary.
now,
the
form
is
the
form
--
the
form
simply
says
what
it
says.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
i
would
say
that
they
filed.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well,
i
would
say
then,
by
september
5
when
they
finally
filed,
the
statutory
period
began
to
run.
the
secretary
of
state
had
until
a
letter
was
written.
you
could
postmark,
on
the
9th
or
the
10th
would've
complied.
she
told
the
statutory
period
to
begin
with.
the
law
does
not
require
you
to
do
a
useless
act,
of
course.
and,
this
is
court
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
with
the
probate
judges?
i
think
she
spoke
for
the
probate
judges
and
i
think,
certainly,
in
the
case
of
these
six,
judge
herndon,
as
shown
by
past
acts,
that
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well,
in
the
record,
we
find
the
probate
judge's
do
contact
mabel
amos
and
we
do
set
out
in
brief,
almost
in
full,
a
letter
from
a
probate
judge
saying
“i
don't
think
this
is
worth
the
paper
it's
written
on,
and
i'm
going
to
contact
ms.
amos
about
this.”
and,
i
think
that
pretty
well
clears
for
the
record
that
it
butted
down
this
sort
of
works
together
in
matters
like
this.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
in
alabama?
i
think
that
sometimes
that
happens,
quite
often.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes,
sir.
the
state
of
alabama's
constructed
--
well,
yes,
you
do.
and,
the
state
of
alabama
in
the
case
of
herndon
versus
lee,
and
you
asked
a
question
a
moment
ago
about
what
kind
of
man
is
this
man
as
shown
from
the
record.
i
suggest
that
there's
an
excellent
series
of
cases
arising
out
of
greene
county
to
judge
this
man.
he's
been
a
party
in
a
number
of
cases.
the
case
of
herndon
versus
lee
is
the
case
with
respect
to
the
filing
of
these
corrupt
practices
act
statements.
as
we
say,
there,
the
shoe
was
off
the
other
foot
because
there
was
--
a
negro
can't
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
alright.
in
this
case,
well,
the
case
of
herndon
versus
lee
is
the
law
we're
referring
to
there
with
mr.
justice
white,
and
the
only
opinion
that
i
can
talk
to
you
about
of
alabama
law
interpreting
these
--
the
statutes
we're
involved
in,
and
it
simply
says
september
5,
the
date
to
file
with
probate
judges
or
with
the
secretary
of
state
the
sundry
certificates
to
go
to
different
places.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
no,
you
have
to
file
in
your
county
offices.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
in
the
probate
judge.
you
have
to
file
your
district
offices,
the
state
laws
--
courts
have
held,
in
all
offices
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
no,
that's
not
the
sole
position
we
take.
no,
sir.
no,
we
have
other
positions.
i'll
take
them
right
now.
that's
the
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
that's
a
position.
the
second
one
is
that,
in
fact,
the
--
when
the
secretary
of
state
acted,
when
she
acted
for
everybody,
the
second
is
that,
in
fact,
some
were
filed
in
our
--
across
the
state
and
that
these
complex
factual
issues
were
not
determined
by
the
district
court
as
to
who
had
and
who
had
not.
and,
thirdly,
we
return
back
over
to
the
same
probate
judges
who,
in
some
instances,
would
have
turned
us
down
to
determine
whether
we've
done
it
or
not.
fourth,
there's
no
hearing
in
alabama
law
granted
to
anybody.
fifth,
that
there
was
a
discriminatory
application
of
the
statutes
because
this
is
the
first
reported
case
where
someone
has
acted,
a
probate
judge,
on
his
own
initiative.
all
other
reported
cases
have
been
otherwise.
there's
an
unequal
application
statute
on
the
part
of
the
probate
judge's
and,
certainly,
on
the
part
of
the
secretary
of
state.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well,
judge
johnson
says
there's
been
a
policy
in
the
state
of
alabama
continuously,
in
his
dissent,
of
a
private
enforcement
of
the
statute,
never
public
enforcement.
never
before
has
anyone
moved
in
to
enforce
it.
and,
in
this
particular
case,
this
is
the
first
instance.
we
contend
it's
the
first
instance
because
it's
the
first
real
threat
that's
come
along,
at
least
of
latest,
since
this
act
was
there.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well,
our
only
precedent
is
the
dissenting
opinion
in
this
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
thank
you.
we
do
have
one
more
though,
and
that
is,
certainly
with
respect
to
greene
county,
i
think
your
resent
decision
in
glover
versus
san
francisco
railroad
company,
we
say
it's
not
necessary
to
use
as
that
by
going
to
a
labor
arbitrator
or
the
union
officials
when
you
know
you
can't
get
adjudication.
i
think
we've
got
something
in
this
record
that
might
show
us
we're
in
that
same
sort
of
position.
now,
the
question
of
mootness
was
raised.
the
classic
makes
it
quite
clear.
we
have
a
right
to
have
our
votes
counted,
and
i'm
talking
about
across
the
board
now,
not
just
greene
county.
we
have
a
right
to
hold
primary
elections
that
depends
upon
the
number
of
votes
that
we
got.
it's
a
declaratory
judgment.
we
need
to
decide
these
matters
now,
rather
than
in
a
later
time.
and,
the
district
court
opinion,
of
course,
does
uphold
and
did
rule
on
the
constitutionality
of
section
125
and
148
of
the
alabama
code,
as
well
as
the
garret
law
and
the
corrupt
practices
act.
the
relief,
a
question
was
asked
about
that
and
i
just
want
to
urge
that
the
relief
be
as
specific
as
possible.
but
you
know,
we're
talking
about
--
when
we
talk
about
primary
elections
in
greene
county,
just
remember
we're
talking
about
by
either
one
of
the
two
figures
we've
got,
127%
or
124%
of
the
white
population
of
the
county
is
registered
to
vote.
now,
we
know
that's
not
right
but
--
that
can't
be,
but
there
are
a
lot
of
names
there
that
don't
live
there.
accuse
anybody
with
respect
to
that,
but
i
just
say
that
they're
there
and
that's
one
of
the
criteria
the
attorney
general
uses
in
sending
examiners
in
and
observers
into
a
county
is,
have
they
purged
the
rules?
second,
primary
elections
are
run
by
the
local
democratic
party
folks,
always.
and,
in
those
elections,
there's
always
an
alternate
ballot
position
and,
in
this
case,
the
only
relief
we
have
so
far,
and
i
believe
after
the
three
mississippi
cases
were
argued
here
and
since
there's
such
concern
about
setting
aside
elections,
that
the
temporary
relief
of
this
court
could
quite
possibly
have
been
utilized
to
force
all
the
setting
aside
of
any
elections
and,
in
that
way,
not
go
back
and
disturb
anything.
but,
in
this
case,
the
only
relief
that
we
have
now
is
that
the
incumbents
are
in
office
and
hold
over
under
alabama
law,
and
the
sheriff's
been
holding
over
since
1966.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes,
i
think
a
new
election
--
first,
new
election.
i
think
certain
things
with
respect
to
the
order
by
a
new
election
should
be
done.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
if
we
accept
the
judge
--
the
contentions,
as
i
understand
them,
that
he
didn't
have
notice
or
the
alternative
contention
that
if
he
had,
he
didn't
understand
it
in
those
or
whatever
it
is.
under
those
circumstances,
i
think
they're
still
entitled,
of
course,
to
a
new
election
in
greene
county.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
if
the
court
decides
that
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
if
the
court
decides
that
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well,
i
think,
as
far
as
judge
herndon
is
concerned,
he's
still
in
contempt.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
i
don't
think
in
light
of
walker
and
i
don't
think
in
light
of
the
statement
in
carol
about
moving
forward
through
the
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
in
the
--
it
depends
on
what's
--
we're
talking
about
the
garret
law
and
corrupt
practices
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
held
it
constitutional
on
its
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
then,
in
that
case,
if
they
did
not
reserve
to
be
on
the
ballot,
and
you
can't
re-correctively
put
them
on
it,
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
judge
herndon's
contempt
but
it
has
something
to
do
with
whatever
relief
you
grant,
your
relief
that
they're
entitled
to.
i
do
want
to
point
out,
with
respect
to
section
125
on
election
officials,
that
this
record
does
disclose
that
there
were
120
election
officials
in
greene
county,
14
of
them
were
negros
and
81%
of
the
population
is
negro.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
no
--
which
one?
the
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
on
the
merits?
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
oh,
no.
on
the
constitutionality
of
the
corrupt
practices
act
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
no,
the
constitutionality
of
the
corrupt
practices
act
itself,
i
think
that
any
act
which
deprives
a
man
of
the
right
to
be
on
a
ballot
and
the
voters
who
could
vote
for
him
of
the
right
for
him
to
be
on
the
ballot
by
an
arbitrary
act
without
a
right
to
a
hearing.
there's
no
right
--
no
due
process
right
to
a
hearing
here
at
all.
the
probate
judge
says
he's
not
entitled
to
be
on
the
ballot
and
there's
no
statute
that
gives
him
a
right
to
go
in
and
get
on
the
ballot.
and,
at
this
instance,
it's
september
5.
i
just
don't
know
what
the
man
can
do
and
i
don't
see
how
that
can
be
constitutional
in
that
sense
of
the
corrupt
practices
act.
i
certainly
think
the
corrupt
practices
act
generally
should
be
and
are,
and
this
particular
provision
by
--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
i
think
that
you
--
yes,
a
due
process
argument
independent
of
any
equal
protection
argument
at
all.
and,
secondly,
i
think
the
statute
itself,
by
its
very
wording,
is
really
rather
vague
as
to
what
it
does
say
and
it's
essentially
a
criminal
statute.
i
mean,
i
don't
know
that
you
can
read
that
statute
and
really
know
what
you're
supposed
to
do
because
i
know
that
you
can't
tell
what
day
you're
supposed
to
file.
if
you
don't
read
the
case,
you
can't
tell
because
it
doesn't
say.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
i
think
so,
yes.
it's
--
the
--
their
penal
sanctions
are
later
in
the
code
that
it's
a
violation
of
corrupt
practices
act,
they
can
go
at
it
that
way,
or
they
can
keep
him
off
the
ballot,
they
can
do
both.
i
really
have
nothing
more
if
there
are
no
more
questions,
except
to
say
that,
as
the
president
said
yesterday,
“the
laws
have
caught
up
with
our
conscience
and
what
remains
is
to
give
life
to
the
law,”
and
i
think
that's
what
this
case
is
really
all
about.
