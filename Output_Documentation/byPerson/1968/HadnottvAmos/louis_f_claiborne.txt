mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
first,
a
word
about
the
matter
of
contempt,
we
don't
wish
to
take
any
absolute
position
with
respect
to
that
matter.
it
seemed
to
us
that
the
order
of
this
court,
merely
restoring
a
detailed
order
of
the
district
court,
and
the
violation
of
the
terms
of
that
order
of
the
district
court
might
be
viewed
as
well
as
contempt
of
the
district
court's
order
as
contempt
of
this
court's
order,
perhaps
in
both,
if
in
both
or
if
only
at
the
district
court's
order,
it
would
seem
to
us
appropriate
for
that
matter
to
be
explored
more
fully
in
the
district
court
since
there
are
admittedly
disputed
questions
of
fact
to
be
explored.
on
the
one
end,
judge
herndon,
as
we
understand
it,
was
served
sometime
back
with
a
copy
of
the
order
of
the
district
court
in
september
18.
it
was,
therefore,
presumably
fully
aware
of
its
terms
and
how
it
applied
to
him
and
the
candidates
that
he
is
carrying.
if
he
received
notice
that
that
very
order,
which
he'd
already
seen
and
studied
and
presumably
he
was
ready
to
effectuate,
had
been
restored
by
order
of
this
court,
he
needed
no
further
notice
in
order
to
act
on
it.
it
does
appear,
however,
that
he
received
no
formal
communication
of
the
action
of
this
court
either
from
a
clerk
of
this
court
or
from
the
attorneys
representing
alabama
before
the
court.
why
he
received
no
notice
from
the
attorney
general's
office
of
alabama
is
perhaps
one
of
the
matters
that
deserve
exploration.
he
did
admittedly
read
some
accounts
of
this
court's
action
in
the
newspapers,
but
we're
not
clear
whether
that
came
home
to
him
or
not.
under
those
circumstances,
it
seems
to
us
that
the
matter
is
not
yet
ready
for
adjudication,
that
the
district
court
is
obviously
a
more
convenient
forum.
that
jurisdictionally,
since
it
was
the
order
of
that
court,
however
affected
by
a
subsequent
order
here,
it
was
violated.
that
court
would
have
jurisdiction
to
explore
the
matter.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
our
suggestion,
mr.
justice
fortas,
is
that
this
court
in
its
judgment,
among
other
relief,
direct
the
district
court
to
undertake
such
further
proceedings
with
respect
to
the
matter
of
contempt
as
it
deems
appropriate.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
contempt
of
orders
issued
in
the
case
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
excuse
me.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
would
suppose,
mr.
justice
fortas,
that
the
court
would
wish
to
leave
that
open.
that,
if
the
proceedings
in
the
district
court
indicated
any
contempt,
whatever
had
been
arguably
committed
sufficient
to
cause
issuance
of
an
order
to
show
cause
or
such
further
proceedings
that
might
be
appropriate,
then
the
district
court
might
refer
that
matter
back
here
or
might
proceed
ahead
on
its
own.
i
wouldn't
suppose
this
court
would
need
to
foreclose
itself
from,
at
a
proper
time,
considering
whether
a
contempt
of
its
own
order
had
been
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
as
i
understand
the
proceedings
in
ship,
your
honor
is
correct.
the
order
to
show
cause
issued
here
and,
in
order
to
explore
the
factual
setting,
a
commissioner
was
appointed
by
this
court.
i'm
not
suggesting
that
the
district
court
stand
in
the
place
of
that
commissioner
that,
rather,
since
its
appears
the
district
court's
order
was
violated,
that
it
might,
at
least
initially,
undertake
the
proceeding
in
its
own
name
on
suggestion
of
this
court
when
it
--
when
jurisdiction
is
restored.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
in
truth,
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
would
think
one
would
follow
from
the
other
if
the
district
court
should
conclude
that,
upon
further
exploration,
either
there
were
no
colors
to
proceed
further
in
contempt.
then
i
would
think
that
while
this
court
be
free
to
reexamine
the
matter.
that
should
be
the
end
of
it.
my
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
not
by
the
united
states,
insofar
as
i
know,
not
by
the
plaintiffs
in
the
case.
united
states
did
file,
as
this
court
was
made
aware
by
memorandum
filed
on
--
months
ago
by
the
solicitor
general.
untied
states
did
intervene
in
the
proceedings
there,
became
a
party,
and
did
secure
orders,
the
purpose
of
which
was
to
maintain
the
status
quo
to
prevent
the
promulgation
and
effectiveness
of
the
election
in
greene
county
on
the
ground
that
it
was
defective,
until
such
time
as
this
court
could
adjudicate
the
merits,
but
we
did
not
proceed
in
--
by
an
order
to
show
cause
and
defense.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
there
is
a
very
old
case
in
sabine,
dallas,
but
i
frankly
forget
the
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
it
is
not.
the
other
case
that
i'm
about
to
cite
in
here
are
merrimack
which,
as
i
remember,
involves
a
court
of
appeal
and
a
district
court,
barnet
which
involved
an
order
issued
directly
by
court
of
appeal
but,
arguably,
also
involving
orders
of
the
district
court
and,
finally,
ship
which
involved
only
an
order
of
this
court
and
not
even
--
no
order
of
the
district
court,
the
district
court
having
denied
stays
the
habeas
corpus
to
the
prisoner.
so
certainly,
in
recent
history,
i
think
ship
is
the
only
precedent,
justice
fortas,
so
--
and
the
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
i
may
have
muddied
our
own
suggestion,
mr.
justice
brennan.
it
really
was
that
this
court
take
no
action
itself
with
respect
to
the
matter
of
contempt,
except
to
leave
the
district
court
free
to
proceed
on
the
theory,
pro
tanto
at
least,
that
it
was
the
district
court's
order
that
was
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
so.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
though,
i
dare
say,
that
the
implication
of
a
provision
and
mandate
of
this
court
expressly
leaving
the
district
court
free
to
proceed
in
contempt
would
carry
the
implication
that
this
court
at
least
tended
to
be
viewed
the
violation,
if
any,
as
one
of
that
court's
order
or
be
it
restored
here
rather
than
an
original
matter
here.
now
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
i
should
think
that
if
the
district
court
took
no
action
whatever
on
the
ground
that
its
own
order
had
expired
and
was
no
longer
a
viable
law,
court
order
which
could
be
violated,
then
this
court
would
have
to
reexamine
to
that.
if,
however,
it
took
no
action
because
it
found
from
the
facts
already
before
it
or
then
before
it
that
there
was
no
cause
to
proceed
further,
being
no
indication
--
sufficient
indication
of
criminal
contempt
to
justify
those
proceedings,
this
court
might
likewise
let
the
matter
rest.
i'm
not
suggesting
which
outcome
is
more
likely
or
more
appropriate.
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
turn
to
the
merits
because
where
the
united
states
has
participated
here
with
the
view
to
speaking
to
the
merits
rather
than
to
the
matter
of
contempt.
as
we
see
this
case,
it
does
involve
a
serious
abridgment
of
the
rights
of
negro
citizens
in
alabama
to
fully
participate
in
the
political
process.
and,
that
comes
at
a
time
when
they
are
now
registered
to
vote.
the
question
is
whether
they
shall
be
committed
to
cast
their
ballots
for
the
candidate
of
their
choice.
it
seems
to
us,
this
effort
--
previous
efforts
must
be
condemned,
and
that
is
so
even
if
one
does
not
assume
that
this
is
a
deliberate
discrimination
on
account
of
race.
even
though
in
light
of
history,
both
ancient
history
and
recent
history,
it's
difficult
to
indulge
in
that
assumption,
but
what
is
at
stake
here
are
at
least
three
rights:
the
right
of
persons
to
associate
together
for
political
purposes
to
form
an
effective
party,
in
this
case,
something
of
a
splinter-party
from
the
democratic
party.
there
is
also
the
right
of
the
candidates
themselves,
specific
candidates
involved
here,
to
run
for
political
office
to
have
votes
casted
on
that
is
to
be
on
the
ballot.
and,
finally
and
perhaps
most
important,
are
the
rights
of
a
group
of
citizens
here,
as
it
happens,
a
majority
of
the
citizens
in
these
counties,
to
vote
for,
to
select,
to
cast
their
votes
for
the
candidate
of
their
choice.
if
they're
not
permitted
to
that
as
in
greene
county,
if
they
only
have
one
slate,
they're
affectively
disfranchised.
you
don't
want
to
vote
for
these
candidates,
their
own
candidates
are
taken
off
the
ballot,
and
their
folks
for
all
offices
are
defeated.
now,
that
was
done
in
this
case.
there
was
67
candidates
being
with,
that
is,
local
candidates.
i'm
only
speaking
of
the
local
candidates
because
candidates
for
presidential
elector,
for
national
office
and
for
statewide
office
were
defeated
by
any
combination
of
statistics.
therefore,
it
seems
to
us
is
a
practical
matter,
perhaps
the
legal
matter.
the
case
is
live
only
with
respect
to
the
local
candidates,
and
then
only
with
respect
to
those
23
of
them
who
prevailed
or
would
have
prevailed,
23
out
of
67,
approximately
a-third
prevailed
or
would
have
prevailed.
17
of
those
were,
in
fact,
elected
in
three
counties:
marengo,
etowah,
and
sumter
counties.
they
were
elected,
however,
at
the
very
minor
posts:
justice
of
the
peace,
constable,
in
one
case
chairman
of
the
board
of
education.
there
was
more,
it's
taking
greene
county,
four
seats
on
the
five-man
board
of
commissioners
which
governs
the
county
were
up
for
election,
and
they
were
ndpa
candidates
for
each
of
those
four
posts.
the
statistics
make
it
perfectly
clear
they
would
have
prevailed
had
they
been
on
the
ballot.
and,
also,
there
were
two
seats
on
the
five-man
board
of
education
and
mr.
morgan
pointed
out,
the
local
head
of
this
party
was
already
sitting
on
the
board
of
education,
and
there
were
now
two
more
seats
up
and,
again,
the
negro
candidates
from
all
that
appears
would
have
prevailed
for
those
seats.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
way
we
judged
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--
the
actual
votes
cast
for
the
white
candidates
were
at
the
best,
taking
with
the
one
with
highest
numbers
because
there
are
number
1,709,
the
number
of
straight
party
votes
for
the
ndpa
ticket
which
was
officially
reported
the
district
court
on
its
order
was
something
like
1,938.
those
votes,
straight
party
votes,
for
the
ndpa
ticket
would,
opposed
to
counted,
for
the
local
candidates
had
they
been
on
the
ballot,
this
is
rather
clearly
seen
if
one
looks
at
the
sample
ballots
we
have
at
the
back
of
our
brief.
the
first
one
being
the
one
used
in
the
“for
all
absentee
voters,”
the
second
being
the
one
youth
or
perhaps
teens
voters
which
includes
the
six
local
candidates.
the
general
impression
one
gets
from
reading
what
there
is
to
the
record
in
this
case
is,
first,
what
one
does
whether
it's
entirely
an
accident
that
where
there
was
most
at
stake,
somehow
these
candidates
didn't
appear
on
the
ballot.
then,
one
has
a
strong
impression
that
there's
been
a
tremendous
amount
of
vacillation.
the
secretary
of
state
said
she
would
certify
these
people,
then
she
wouldn't,
then
she
would.
finally,
she
didn't.
the
reasons
given
vary
from
time
to
time.
the
final
and
only
arguably
serious
reason
that
was
ultimately
given
was
given
only
after
this
lawsuit
was
filed
and
never
invoked
before,
nor
was
it
invoked
in
other
counties.
apparently,
it
was
thought
appropriate
to
invoke
it
in
greene
county.
the
net
result,
in
any
event,
is
that
a
majority
of
the
voters
in
these
four
counties
were
denied
an
opportunity,
if
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
prevails,
to
cast
their
vote
for
the
candidate
of
their
choice.
now,
the
provision
most
immediately
involved
is
section
274
of
the
corrupt
practices
act,
subsections
in
the
alabama
code
which
was
a
part
of
the
corrupt
practices
act,
which
provides
that
within
five
days
after
he
designates
himself
to
run
for
elective
office,
he
must
file
a
designation
of
his
finance
committee.
in
fact,
failure
to
that
timely,
it
is
alleged,
is
the
reason
why
these
candidates
were
kept
off
the
ballot
in
greene
county
and
should've
been
kept
off
the
ballot,
according
to
the
state,
elsewhere,
though
the
judges
of
probate
in
those
other
counties
didn't
seem
inclined
to
invoke
this
provision.
it's
not
a
very
critical
provision
of
the
election
laws,
at
least
with
respect
to
local
office.
if
you
look
at
some
of
the
appendices
we've
filed,
you'll
see
that
these
candidates
spent
something
approaching
$150.00
in
the
primary
and
general
election
campaign.
the
question
of
having
a
finance
committee,
a
treasurer,
or
disbursement
of
expenses,
tallying
of
contributions
is
not
critical,
it
seems
to
us,
with
respect
to
that
kind
of
office.
notice
it
appears
that
alabama
took
this
requirement
very
seriously.
as
i
just
said,
in
some
counties
it
appears
to
have
been
waived
all
together.
it
doesn't
appear,
as
judge
johnson
pointed
out,
that
the
state
officials
themselves
ever
invoked
these
provisions
to
respond
to
him,
nor
is
it
easy
to
see
why
it
would
matter,
assuming
there's
no
corrupt
purpose,
but
simply
an
oversight
why
it
would
matter
if
this
designation
were
filed
a
few
days
late
if
it
had
been
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
candidate.
what's
more,
the
provision
isn't
very
clear
on
its
face.
it's
not
clear
when
the
five
days
started
to
run.
for
the
white
candidates,
the
five
days
apparently
started
to
run
from
the
time
they
first
announced
themselves
as
candidate
on
march
1
because
they
never
filed
anything
else.
they
then
filed
the
designation,
first,
in
announcement
and,
in
the
same
form,
they
designated
themselves
as
their
own
committee,
which
is
what
the
form
provides
for
as
a
very
pro
forma
operation.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
they
all
did
that,
white
and
negro
candidates.
for
the
white
candidates,
that
was
apparently
deemed
sufficient.
for
the
negro
candidates,
it
was
not.
it
was
held
that
they
should've
filed
a
second
designation
of
themselves
as
their
own
finance
committee,
if
that's
what
they
chose
to
do,
after
they
formally
submitted
their
nominations
as
candidates
of
this
ndpa
party
on
september
5.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
alabama
statute,
which
is
reprinted
in
our
brief,
at
page
3
(a)
i
believe,
is
unclear
whether
more
than
one
such
designation
is
necessary.
it
merely
reads
as
follows.
within
five
days
of
the
announcement
of
his
candidacy
for
any
office,
each
candidate,
this
is
for
a
state
office,
shall
file
with
the
secretary
of
sate
and
each
candidate
for
a
county
office
shall
file
with
the
judge
of
probate,
and
each
candidate
for
a
circuit
and
so
forth,
a
statement
showing
the
name
of
not
less
than
one
and
no
more
than
five
persons
elected
to
receive
and
expend
all
of
it,
and
so
forth,
moneys
received.
nothing
whatever
about
doing
it
again
after
the
primary
seems
to
be
clear,
as
a
matter
of
alabama
law,
if
this
applies
to
primaries,
no
suggestion
that
it
must
be
done
twice
and,
indeed,
implication
in
this
record
is
that
it
need
not
be
done
twice,
at
least
when
you're
successful
in
the
primary,
nor
does
this
requirement
say
that
you
must
announce
the
party
with
which
you're
affiliated.
that's
part
of
the
garret
act
and,
as
to
the
garret
act,
we
say
that
it
was
not
properly
cleared
under
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965,
and
therefore,
cannot
be
made
applicable
to
the
selection.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
there
is
a
decision
involving
people
in
greene
county,
herndon
versus
lee.
there's
judge
herndon
and
lee
is
presently
sheriff
lee,
whom
we
were
told
is
still
sheriff,
though
the
election
of
1966
was
enjoined
by
federal
court.
it
was
there
held
that
the
negro
candidate
for
sheriff,
gilmore,
could
not
be
placed
on
the
ballot
because
he
had
filed
his
designation
within
five
days
after
he
had
accepted
the
nomination
of
the
freedom
party,
rather
than
five
days
after
the
party
had
certified
his
nomination.
that's
inconsistent
with
the
way
in
which
it
was
applied
to
the
white
candidates
here.
the
democratic
party
certified
these
white
candidates
and
nothing
further
was
filed
by
the
candidates.
their
designation
was
deemed
sufficient
back
on
march
1,
two
months
before
they
were
ever
nominated
before
the
primary
had
been
held.
finally,
it
seems
to
us
that
in
this
case,
and
generally
but
specially
in
this
case,
this
requirement
of
alabama
law
was
employed
unfairly
because
no
opportunity
was
afforded
to
these
candidates
to
correct
what
is,
in
the
circumstances,
a
mere
technical
defect
and
that
depriving
them
of
a
place
in
the
ballot
and
depriving
their
constituents
of
a
vote
is
to
make
too
much
turning
on
to
the
law.
that
reason,
we
submit,
the
judgment
below
should
be
reversed,
that
even
actions
ordered
in
greene
county.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
first,
a
word
about
the
matter
of
contempt,
we
don't
wish
to
take
any
absolute
position
with
respect
to
that
matter.
it
seemed
to
us
that
the
order
of
this
court,
merely
restoring
a
detailed
order
of
the
district
court,
and
the
violation
of
the
terms
of
that
order
of
the
district
court
might
be
viewed
as
well
as
contempt
of
the
district
court's
order
as
contempt
of
this
court's
order,
perhaps
in
both,
if
in
both
or
if
only
at
the
district
court's
order,
it
would
seem
to
us
appropriate
for
that
matter
to
be
explored
more
fully
in
the
district
court
since
there
are
admittedly
disputed
questions
of
fact
to
be
explored.
on
the
one
end,
judge
herndon,
as
we
understand
it,
was
served
sometime
back
with
a
copy
of
the
order
of
the
district
court
in
september
18.
it
was,
therefore,
presumably
fully
aware
of
its
terms
and
how
it
applied
to
him
and
the
candidates
that
he
is
carrying.
if
he
received
notice
that
that
very
order,
which
he'd
already
seen
and
studied
and
presumably
he
was
ready
to
effectuate,
had
been
restored
by
order
of
this
court,
he
needed
no
further
notice
in
order
to
act
on
it.
it
does
appear,
however,
that
he
received
no
formal
communication
of
the
action
of
this
court
either
from
a
clerk
of
this
court
or
from
the
attorneys
representing
alabama
before
the
court.
why
he
received
no
notice
from
the
attorney
general's
office
of
alabama
is
perhaps
one
of
the
matters
that
deserve
exploration.
he
did
admittedly
read
some
accounts
of
this
court's
action
in
the
newspapers,
but
we're
not
clear
whether
that
came
home
to
him
or
not.
under
those
circumstances,
it
seems
to
us
that
the
matter
is
not
yet
ready
for
adjudication,
that
the
district
court
is
obviously
a
more
convenient
forum.
that
jurisdictionally,
since
it
was
the
order
of
that
court,
however
affected
by
a
subsequent
order
here,
it
was
violated.
that
court
would
have
jurisdiction
to
explore
the
matter.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
our
suggestion,
mr.
justice
fortas,
is
that
this
court
in
its
judgment,
among
other
relief,
direct
the
district
court
to
undertake
such
further
proceedings
with
respect
to
the
matter
of
contempt
as
it
deems
appropriate.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
contempt
of
orders
issued
in
the
case
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
excuse
me.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
would
suppose,
mr.
justice
fortas,
that
the
court
would
wish
to
leave
that
open.
that,
if
the
proceedings
in
the
district
court
indicated
any
contempt,
whatever
had
been
arguably
committed
sufficient
to
cause
issuance
of
an
order
to
show
cause
or
such
further
proceedings
that
might
be
appropriate,
then
the
district
court
might
refer
that
matter
back
here
or
might
proceed
ahead
on
its
own.
i
wouldn't
suppose
this
court
would
need
to
foreclose
itself
from,
at
a
proper
time,
considering
whether
a
contempt
of
its
own
order
had
been
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
as
i
understand
the
proceedings
in
ship,
your
honor
is
correct.
the
order
to
show
cause
issued
here
and,
in
order
to
explore
the
factual
setting,
a
commissioner
was
appointed
by
this
court.
i'm
not
suggesting
that
the
district
court
stand
in
the
place
of
that
commissioner
that,
rather,
since
its
appears
the
district
court's
order
was
violated,
that
it
might,
at
least
initially,
undertake
the
proceeding
in
its
own
name
on
suggestion
of
this
court
when
it
--
when
jurisdiction
is
restored.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
in
truth,
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
would
think
one
would
follow
from
the
other
if
the
district
court
should
conclude
that,
upon
further
exploration,
either
there
were
no
colors
to
proceed
further
in
contempt.
then
i
would
think
that
while
this
court
be
free
to
reexamine
the
matter.
that
should
be
the
end
of
it.
my
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
not
by
the
united
states,
insofar
as
i
know,
not
by
the
plaintiffs
in
the
case.
united
states
did
file,
as
this
court
was
made
aware
by
memorandum
filed
on
--
months
ago
by
the
solicitor
general.
untied
states
did
intervene
in
the
proceedings
there,
became
a
party,
and
did
secure
orders,
the
purpose
of
which
was
to
maintain
the
status
quo
to
prevent
the
promulgation
and
effectiveness
of
the
election
in
greene
county
on
the
ground
that
it
was
defective,
until
such
time
as
this
court
could
adjudicate
the
merits,
but
we
did
not
proceed
in
--
by
an
order
to
show
cause
and
defense.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
there
is
a
very
old
case
in
sabine,
dallas,
but
i
frankly
forget
the
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
it
is
not.
the
other
case
that
i'm
about
to
cite
in
here
are
merrimack
which,
as
i
remember,
involves
a
court
of
appeal
and
a
district
court,
barnet
which
involved
an
order
issued
directly
by
court
of
appeal
but,
arguably,
also
involving
orders
of
the
district
court
and,
finally,
ship
which
involved
only
an
order
of
this
court
and
not
even
--
no
order
of
the
district
court,
the
district
court
having
denied
stays
the
habeas
corpus
to
the
prisoner.
so
certainly,
in
recent
history,
i
think
ship
is
the
only
precedent,
justice
fortas,
so
--
and
the
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
i
may
have
muddied
our
own
suggestion,
mr.
justice
brennan.
it
really
was
that
this
court
take
no
action
itself
with
respect
to
the
matter
of
contempt,
except
to
leave
the
district
court
free
to
proceed
on
the
theory,
pro
tanto
at
least,
that
it
was
the
district
court's
order
that
was
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
so.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
though,
i
dare
say,
that
the
implication
of
a
provision
and
mandate
of
this
court
expressly
leaving
the
district
court
free
to
proceed
in
contempt
would
carry
the
implication
that
this
court
at
least
tended
to
be
viewed
the
violation,
if
any,
as
one
of
that
court's
order
or
be
it
restored
here
rather
than
an
original
matter
here.
now
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
i
should
think
that
if
the
district
court
took
no
action
whatever
on
the
ground
that
its
own
order
had
expired
and
was
no
longer
a
viable
law,
court
order
which
could
be
violated,
then
this
court
would
have
to
reexamine
to
that.
if,
however,
it
took
no
action
because
it
found
from
the
facts
already
before
it
or
then
before
it
that
there
was
no
cause
to
proceed
further,
being
no
indication
--
sufficient
indication
of
criminal
contempt
to
justify
those
proceedings,
this
court
might
likewise
let
the
matter
rest.
i'm
not
suggesting
which
outcome
is
more
likely
or
more
appropriate.
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
turn
to
the
merits
because
where
the
united
states
has
participated
here
with
the
view
to
speaking
to
the
merits
rather
than
to
the
matter
of
contempt.
as
we
see
this
case,
it
does
involve
a
serious
abridgment
of
the
rights
of
negro
citizens
in
alabama
to
fully
participate
in
the
political
process.
and,
that
comes
at
a
time
when
they
are
now
registered
to
vote.
the
question
is
whether
they
shall
be
committed
to
cast
their
ballots
for
the
candidate
of
their
choice.
it
seems
to
us,
this
effort
--
previous
efforts
must
be
condemned,
and
that
is
so
even
if
one
does
not
assume
that
this
is
a
deliberate
discrimination
on
account
of
race.
even
though
in
light
of
history,
both
ancient
history
and
recent
history,
it's
difficult
to
indulge
in
that
assumption,
but
what
is
at
stake
here
are
at
least
three
rights:
the
right
of
persons
to
associate
together
for
political
purposes
to
form
an
effective
party,
in
this
case,
something
of
a
splinter-party
from
the
democratic
party.
there
is
also
the
right
of
the
candidates
themselves,
specific
candidates
involved
here,
to
run
for
political
office
to
have
votes
casted
on
that
is
to
be
on
the
ballot.
and,
finally
and
perhaps
most
important,
are
the
rights
of
a
group
of
citizens
here,
as
it
happens,
a
majority
of
the
citizens
in
these
counties,
to
vote
for,
to
select,
to
cast
their
votes
for
the
candidate
of
their
choice.
if
they're
not
permitted
to
that
as
in
greene
county,
if
they
only
have
one
slate,
they're
affectively
disfranchised.
you
don't
want
to
vote
for
these
candidates,
their
own
candidates
are
taken
off
the
ballot,
and
their
folks
for
all
offices
are
defeated.
now,
that
was
done
in
this
case.
there
was
67
candidates
being
with,
that
is,
local
candidates.
i'm
only
speaking
of
the
local
candidates
because
candidates
for
presidential
elector,
for
national
office
and
for
statewide
office
were
defeated
by
any
combination
of
statistics.
therefore,
it
seems
to
us
is
a
practical
matter,
perhaps
the
legal
matter.
the
case
is
live
only
with
respect
to
the
local
candidates,
and
then
only
with
respect
to
those
23
of
them
who
prevailed
or
would
have
prevailed,
23
out
of
67,
approximately
a-third
prevailed
or
would
have
prevailed.
17
of
those
were,
in
fact,
elected
in
three
counties:
marengo,
etowah,
and
sumter
counties.
they
were
elected,
however,
at
the
very
minor
posts:
justice
of
the
peace,
constable,
in
one
case
chairman
of
the
board
of
education.
there
was
more,
it's
taking
greene
county,
four
seats
on
the
five-man
board
of
commissioners
which
governs
the
county
were
up
for
election,
and
they
were
ndpa
candidates
for
each
of
those
four
posts.
the
statistics
make
it
perfectly
clear
they
would
have
prevailed
had
they
been
on
the
ballot.
and,
also,
there
were
two
seats
on
the
five-man
board
of
education
and
mr.
morgan
pointed
out,
the
local
head
of
this
party
was
already
sitting
on
the
board
of
education,
and
there
were
now
two
more
seats
up
and,
again,
the
negro
candidates
from
all
that
appears
would
have
prevailed
for
those
seats.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
way
we
judged
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--
the
actual
votes
cast
for
the
white
candidates
were
at
the
best,
taking
with
the
one
with
highest
numbers
because
there
are
number
1,709,
the
number
of
straight
party
votes
for
the
ndpa
ticket
which
was
officially
reported
the
district
court
on
its
order
was
something
like
1,938.
those
votes,
straight
party
votes,
for
the
ndpa
ticket
would,
opposed
to
counted,
for
the
local
candidates
had
they
been
on
the
ballot,
this
is
rather
clearly
seen
if
one
looks
at
the
sample
ballots
we
have
at
the
back
of
our
brief.
the
first
one
being
the
one
used
in
the
“for
all
absentee
voters,”
the
second
being
the
one
youth
or
perhaps
teens
voters
which
includes
the
six
local
candidates.
the
general
impression
one
gets
from
reading
what
there
is
to
the
record
in
this
case
is,
first,
what
one
does
whether
it's
entirely
an
accident
that
where
there
was
most
at
stake,
somehow
these
candidates
didn't
appear
on
the
ballot.
then,
one
has
a
strong
impression
that
there's
been
a
tremendous
amount
of
vacillation.
the
secretary
of
state
said
she
would
certify
these
people,
then
she
wouldn't,
then
she
would.
finally,
she
didn't.
the
reasons
given
vary
from
time
to
time.
the
final
and
only
arguably
serious
reason
that
was
ultimately
given
was
given
only
after
this
lawsuit
was
filed
and
never
invoked
before,
nor
was
it
invoked
in
other
counties.
apparently,
it
was
thought
appropriate
to
invoke
it
in
greene
county.
the
net
result,
in
any
event,
is
that
a
majority
of
the
voters
in
these
four
counties
were
denied
an
opportunity,
if
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
prevails,
to
cast
their
vote
for
the
candidate
of
their
choice.
now,
the
provision
most
immediately
involved
is
section
274
of
the
corrupt
practices
act,
subsections
in
the
alabama
code
which
was
a
part
of
the
corrupt
practices
act,
which
provides
that
within
five
days
after
he
designates
himself
to
run
for
elective
office,
he
must
file
a
designation
of
his
finance
committee.
in
fact,
failure
to
that
timely,
it
is
alleged,
is
the
reason
why
these
candidates
were
kept
off
the
ballot
in
greene
county
and
should've
been
kept
off
the
ballot,
according
to
the
state,
elsewhere,
though
the
judges
of
probate
in
those
other
counties
didn't
seem
inclined
to
invoke
this
provision.
it's
not
a
very
critical
provision
of
the
election
laws,
at
least
with
respect
to
local
office.
if
you
look
at
some
of
the
appendices
we've
filed,
you'll
see
that
these
candidates
spent
something
approaching
$150.00
in
the
primary
and
general
election
campaign.
the
question
of
having
a
finance
committee,
a
treasurer,
or
disbursement
of
expenses,
tallying
of
contributions
is
not
critical,
it
seems
to
us,
with
respect
to
that
kind
of
office.
notice
it
appears
that
alabama
took
this
requirement
very
seriously.
as
i
just
said,
in
some
counties
it
appears
to
have
been
waived
all
together.
it
doesn't
appear,
as
judge
johnson
pointed
out,
that
the
state
officials
themselves
ever
invoked
these
provisions
to
respond
to
him,
nor
is
it
easy
to
see
why
it
would
matter,
assuming
there's
no
corrupt
purpose,
but
simply
an
oversight
why
it
would
matter
if
this
designation
were
filed
a
few
days
late
if
it
had
been
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
candidate.
what's
more,
the
provision
isn't
very
clear
on
its
face.
it's
not
clear
when
the
five
days
started
to
run.
for
the
white
candidates,
the
five
days
apparently
started
to
run
from
the
time
they
first
announced
themselves
as
candidate
on
march
1
because
they
never
filed
anything
else.
they
then
filed
the
designation,
first,
in
announcement
and,
in
the
same
form,
they
designated
themselves
as
their
own
committee,
which
is
what
the
form
provides
for
as
a
very
pro
forma
operation.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
they
all
did
that,
white
and
negro
candidates.
for
the
white
candidates,
that
was
apparently
deemed
sufficient.
for
the
negro
candidates,
it
was
not.
it
was
held
that
they
should've
filed
a
second
designation
of
themselves
as
their
own
finance
committee,
if
that's
what
they
chose
to
do,
after
they
formally
submitted
their
nominations
as
candidates
of
this
ndpa
party
on
september
5.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
alabama
statute,
which
is
reprinted
in
our
brief,
at
page
3
(a)
i
believe,
is
unclear
whether
more
than
one
such
designation
is
necessary.
it
merely
reads
as
follows.
within
five
days
of
the
announcement
of
his
candidacy
for
any
office,
each
candidate,
this
is
for
a
state
office,
shall
file
with
the
secretary
of
sate
and
each
candidate
for
a
county
office
shall
file
with
the
judge
of
probate,
and
each
candidate
for
a
circuit
and
so
forth,
a
statement
showing
the
name
of
not
less
than
one
and
no
more
than
five
persons
elected
to
receive
and
expend
all
of
it,
and
so
forth,
moneys
received.
nothing
whatever
about
doing
it
again
after
the
primary
seems
to
be
clear,
as
a
matter
of
alabama
law,
if
this
applies
to
primaries,
no
suggestion
that
it
must
be
done
twice
and,
indeed,
implication
in
this
record
is
that
it
need
not
be
done
twice,
at
least
when
you're
successful
in
the
primary,
nor
does
this
requirement
say
that
you
must
announce
the
party
with
which
you're
affiliated.
that's
part
of
the
garret
act
and,
as
to
the
garret
act,
we
say
that
it
was
not
properly
cleared
under
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965,
and
therefore,
cannot
be
made
applicable
to
the
selection.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
there
is
a
decision
involving
people
in
greene
county,
herndon
versus
lee.
there's
judge
herndon
and
lee
is
presently
sheriff
lee,
whom
we
were
told
is
still
sheriff,
though
the
election
of
1966
was
enjoined
by
federal
court.
it
was
there
held
that
the
negro
candidate
for
sheriff,
gilmore,
could
not
be
placed
on
the
ballot
because
he
had
filed
his
designation
within
five
days
after
he
had
accepted
the
nomination
of
the
freedom
party,
rather
than
five
days
after
the
party
had
certified
his
nomination.
that's
inconsistent
with
the
way
in
which
it
was
applied
to
the
white
candidates
here.
the
democratic
party
certified
these
white
candidates
and
nothing
further
was
filed
by
the
candidates.
their
designation
was
deemed
sufficient
back
on
march
1,
two
months
before
they
were
ever
nominated
before
the
primary
had
been
held.
finally,
it
seems
to
us
that
in
this
case,
and
generally
but
specially
in
this
case,
this
requirement
of
alabama
law
was
employed
unfairly
because
no
opportunity
was
afforded
to
these
candidates
to
correct
what
is,
in
the
circumstances,
a
mere
technical
defect
and
that
depriving
them
of
a
place
in
the
ballot
and
depriving
their
constituents
of
a
vote
is
to
make
too
much
turning
on
to
the
law.
that
reason,
we
submit,
the
judgment
below
should
be
reversed,
that
even
actions
ordered
in
greene
county.
