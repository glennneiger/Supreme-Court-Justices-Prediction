justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
may
they
still
be
aggregated?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
we've
got
these
papers
so
recently.
this
charge
of
this
time
i
must
say
you
don't
have
at
hand
but
i
understood
there
are
some
alabama
law
that
prohibits
aggregating.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
just
might
at
the
outset
telling
us
what
is
the
situation
about
the
preparation
and
distribution
of
ballots?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
do
we
have
any
information
what
each
probate
court
judge
did
when
the
interim
order
came
down
from
the
district
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
that
to
say
then
that
to
the
extent
that
ballots
are
being
prepared
whether
they
are
printed
ballots
or
on
voting
machines?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they
comply
with
the
interim
order
and
include
that
the
column
7
list
of
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
redden,
just
so
i
am
clear
about
here,
if
as
you
suggested,
it
might
be
difficult
to
delete
the
electors
now
on
that
under
the
interim
order
to
be
on
the
ballot
for
this
party.
of
course
it
would
be
much
more
difficult
to
substitute
other
names
but
even
if
you
could
substitute
other
names,
i
understand
your
argument
is
and
under
section
148,
that's
prohibited
because
you
cannot
have
the
same
name
for
what,
more
than
one
office
or
as
it
be
for
the
same
offices
i
understand
it,
for
the
office
of
elector,
but
would
that
violate
148
substitute?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
how
old
is
that
provision
148?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
morgan,
is
there
a
question
of
law
here
whether
this
is
our
order
that's
in
this
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
am
i
correct
about
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
initially,
there
was
an
order
of
the
district
court.
an
injunction
was
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and,
that,
i
gather
--
it
was
phrased
in
the
district
court
and
it
was
written
in
the
district
court.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
then
that
was
dissolved
by
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
by
the
three-judge
district
court,
and
then
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
then,
when
you
came
here
last,
we
--
i
gather,
before
the
argument,
was
it,
restored
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
court
--
the
injunction?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
we
restored
it
after
the
argument
on
the
14th?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
word
--
do
we
use
the
word
“reinstate”?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
don't
think
that
that
presents
a
question
whether
it's
our
order
or
the
district
court
order?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
it
would
matter
as
to
the
contempt
proceeding
in
this
court,
would
it
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
was
one
that
preceded
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
which
one
is
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
which
one
are
we
talking
about?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but,
i
gather,
the
--
we
restored
with
one
and
then
continued
the
restoration
with
the
second.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
claiborne,
as
we
follow
the
government's
suggestion,
there
will
be
procedural
tangle,
isn't
there?ordinarily,
i
take
it,
if
we
issued
an
order
to
show
cause
and
asked
the
district
court
to
take
testimony
on
a
factual
controversy,
i
gather,
its
conclusions
as
to
fact
will
be
subject
to,
what,
to
exceptions
as
in
the
case
of
master's
report?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is,
leave
the
district
court
to
proceed
if
it
determines
that
there
was
a
contempt
of
its
order
in
a
contempt
proceeding
in
that
court
for
contempt
to
that
order
and
let
alone
any
questions
that
concern
a
contempt
of
any
order
of
this
court,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
the
district
court,
quite
appropriately,
take
no
action
whatever
under
your
formula.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
interrupt?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
suppose
that
we
recommend,
i
gather
that
your
view
would
say
that
if
a
party
nominates
by
mass
meeting,
this
requires
them
designation,
what
is
it,
within
five
days
after
what
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
must
be
satisfied?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so,
if
you
have
the
mass
meeting
on
may
7,
or
whatever
the
state
is,
but
the
announcement
doesn't
come
until
september.
then,
there
is
five
days
within
the
announcement
late
in
september,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words
--
well,
then
there's
no
requirement
of
a
formal
announcement
that
she
must
file
something
--
that
someone
that
you
are
a
candidate
for
this
office,
nominated
at
a
mass
meeting?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
one
other
thing?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather
the
victor
in
the
primary
does
not
have
to
make
a
second
designation.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but,
the
question
here
in
focus,
the
alabama
courts
have
not
yet
decided
whether
to
lose
in
the
primary.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
primary?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
nevertheless,
he
is
to
be
on
the
ballot
as
a
candidate
of
another
party.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
whether
he
has
to
make
a
second
designation
is
something
that
hasn't
yet
been
decided
by
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
beg
your
pardon?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
that
issue
has
not
yet
been
decided
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
concluded
by
this
court.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
only
as
to
statewide
offices.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
do
we
have
any
evidence
at
all
as
to
what
happened
as
to
local
offices
which,
i
gather,
any
action
such
as
she
took
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
not
accepting
after
september
10
would've
had
to
been
taken
by
the
probate
judges
at
the
local
offices,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
we'll
recess
at
this
time.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask,
mr.
hubbard.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
an
investigation
that
you
mean
limited
to
the
violation
of
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but,
i
mean,
an
investigation
about
the
district
court
on
behalf
of
this
court
or
an
investigation
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
by
the
district
court
on
its
own.
that's
what
i
was
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
would
we
have
to
decide
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
take
it,
we
could
--
do
you
think
we
might
ask
the
district
court
to
determine
whether
there
had
been
a
contempt
of
its
order
and,
if
so,
to
take
appropriate
proceedings
and
reopen
the
question
whether
there
should
be
a
proceeding
involving
any
possible
contempt
of
an
order
of
this
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
morgan,
are
we
to
understand
that
since
you
don't
seem
independently
to
be
arguing
the
merits,
are
you
buying
the
government's
argument,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
on
the
merits.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
on
the
constitutionality.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
haven't
said
much
about
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
a
due
process
argument
independently
of
any
equal
protection
argument?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why
do
you
say
it's
essentially
a
criminal
statute?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
may
they
still
be
aggregated?

independently
to
be
arguing
the
merits,

on

say
it's
essentially
a
