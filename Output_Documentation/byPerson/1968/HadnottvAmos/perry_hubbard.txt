mr.
perry
hubbard
45
minutes.
mr.
perry
hubbard
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
here
in
behalf
of
the
defendant
in
a
petition
for
rule
to
show
cause,
james
dennis
herndon.
i
will
direct
my
remarks
only
to
the
issues
as
involved
him.
the
question
presently
presented
to
this
court
is
on
motion
of
the
appellants
for
a
rule
to
show
cause
why
judge
herndon
should
not
be
a
judge
in
contempt
of
this
court.
as
has
been
previously
pointed
out,
this
inquiry
is,
in
part,
a
factual
inquiry
and
is,
in
some
respect,
a
question
of
law
or
procedure.
i
consider
it,
at
this
time,
premature
in
the
absence
of
a
full
investigation
of
the
facts
to
undertake
to
argue
to
this
court
the
facts
of
the
alleged
contempt.
i
would
like
to
point
out
only
this.
that,
in
the
democratic
primary
in
may
of
1968,
judge
herndon,
by
virtue
of
the
duties
of
his
office,
was
required
to
have
the
ballot
printed
for
this
election.
in
that
election,
the
ndpa
candidates
ran
and
also
the
candidates
who
were
ultimately
the
nominees
of
the
regular
democratic
parties.
these
were
the
only
two
candidates
running
in
these
--
in
the
democratic
primary.
and,
at
this
time,
there
was
no
pending
suit,
no
judicial
compulsion,
no
coercion,
no
commotion.
nevertheless,
without
any
question,
without
any
problem,
these
names
were
all
placed
on
the
ballot
by
judge
herndon.
the
race
was
run
without
event.
the
county
officials
asked
and
obtained
election
observers
and,
to
assure
the
proper
conduct
of
the
election,
this
was
done
and
the
election
was
held
with
--
uneventfully.
subsequently,
in
september,
a
certificate
of
mass
meeting
as
to
the
nomination
by
mass
meeting,
these
ndpa
candidates,
was
filed
with
judge
herndon.
no
additional
qualification
or
designation
out
of
the
corrupt
practices
act
was
filed.
however,
a
suit
was
filed
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
middle
district.
that
court
entered
an
order,
a
copy
of
which
was
served
upon
judge
herndon,
directing
that
he
include
the
ndpa
candidates
on
the
ballot.
during
the
pendency
of
this
order,
a
temporary
restraining
order
by
the
us
district
court
for
the
middle
district,
it
became
necessary
by
virtue
of
time
limits
to
print
the
absentee
ballot
which
is
required
to
be
available
substantially
in
advance
of
the
time
that
the
regular
ballot
is
available.
and,
with
the
--
for
the
absentee
ballot
for
this
election,
where
he
had
in
his
hand
and
was
aware
of
the
order
of
the
district
court,
was
printed
so
as
to
include
the
ndpa
candidates.
it
was
only
after
he
was
served
with
--
by
the
clerk
of
the
us
district
court
with
a
copy
of
its
order
dissolving
the
temporary
restraining
order,
that
the
ballot
for
the
general
election
was
printed.
now,
mr.
morgan
has
suggested
that
this
printing
was
unusual.
mr.
perry
hubbard
that
was
on
october
14.
mr.
perry
hubbard
it
was
actually
ordered
by
him
on
the
14th.
it
was
apparently
delivered
on
about
the
17th.
and,
mr.
morgan
has
suggested
that
this
was
an
unusually
early
printing
of
the
ballot.
actually,
i
think
that
an
investigation
of
the
fact
will
demonstrate
that
this
was
one
of
the
last
ballots
to
be
printed,
that
the
printer
had
been
insisting
on
our
going
ahead
and
finalizing
the
order
and
that
it
was
done
when
this
order
--
the
dissolution
of
the
temporary
restraining
order
was
made
or
received
by
him.
now,
it
is
not
controverted
in
this
case
that,
subsequent
to
that
time,
there
was
no
delivery
of
any
order.
this
is
not
the
problem,
nor
do
we
convert
--
controvert
that
if
he
had
actual
knowledge
of
the
order
that
he
would
be
equally
in
contempt
of
it
as
if
one
had
been
served
on
him.
this
is
not
the
problem
at
all.
judge
herndon
has
by
his
response
to
the
rule
to
show
cause
or
the
motion
for
rule
to
show
cause,
as
asserted,
that
he
was
absolutely
without
knowledge
of
the
applicability
of
the
restoration
of
this
temporary
restraining
order
in
its
effect
as
to
him
and
to
local
candidates.
and,
this
is
the
factual
question
that
will
be
presented.
mr.
perry
hubbard
yes,
sir.
mr.
perry
hubbard
yes,
sir.
mr.
perry
hubbard
i
believe,
probably
in
the
interim.
as
i
recall
his
deposition,
he
said
that
he
thought
he
saw
some
memorandum
in
the
paper
or
some
article
in
the
paper
on
the
15
or
there
abuts.
mr.
perry
hubbard
yes,
sir.
mr.
perry
hubbard
so
far
as
i
know,
he
took
none.
mr.
perry
hubbard
no,
sir.
mr.
perry
hubbard
not
only
do
his
records
fail
to
reflect
any
communication,
i
don't
think
anyone
--
mr.
perry
hubbard
no,
sir.
in
this
record,
there
is
no
suggestion
that
he
received
a
direct
communication
of
any
description
from
any
state
office
or
officer.
mr.
perry
hubbard
yes,
sir.
it
was
his
understanding
that
the
order
had
applicability
to
the
presidential
electors
and
statewide
candidates.
now,
if
your
honor
will
recall,
this
was
the
primary
or
thrust
of
the
case
at
this
time,
apparently,
in
the
reporting
of
it,
and
i
have
since
read
the
same
articles
and
they
are
susceptible
to
that
interpretation.
mr.
perry
hubbard
i
don't
know
whether
they
had
been
--
they
were
not
incorporated
into
the
copy
of
the
deposition
that
i
had,
though
they
were
read
into
judge
herndon's
deposition.
mr.
perry
hubbard
no,
sir,
they
are
not.
mr.
perry
hubbard
in
the
typed
record,
yes,
sir.
they
were
read
into
judge
herndon's
depositions.
mr.
perry
hubbard
yes,
sir?
mr.
perry
hubbard
yes,
sir,
he
did.
mr.
perry
hubbard
i
don't
have
--
it
is
sufficient
familiarity
to
say
with
assurance
whether
it
was
done
in
precisely
those
terms.
knowing
now
what
i
know
about
the
case,
it
certainly
says
that
there
was
a
restoration
of
the
order.
mr.
perry
hubbard
yes,
sir.
mr.
perry
hubbard
yes,
sir.
mr.
perry
hubbard
no,
sir.
now,
with
regard
to
the
--
there
is
in
the
brief
a
suggestion
with
regard
to
constructive
notice
by
virtue
of
notification
of
the
attorney
general's
office,
and
i
would
like,
in
passing,
to
mention
that
judge
herndon
was
not
a
party,
i
don't
believe,
in
the
original
proceeding
that
was
commenced
in
the
middle
district.
that
was
a
class
action
which
was
begun
against
a
named
probate
judge
and
said,
in
all
other
probate
judges
who
are
similarly
situated,
he
would
not
--
of
course,
a
named
party,
he
will
not
serve
and
did
not
appear
in
that
case.
and,
it
is
our
position
here
that
the
notice
to
someone
who
represents
the
parties
to
a
suit
is
not
notice
to
a
member
of
a
class
who
is
not
actually
a
party
to
the
suit.
in
other
words,
there
is
no
--
and
i
can
understand
why
there
may
have
been
no
direct
communication
because,
indeed,
judge
herndon
was
not
a
defendant
in
the
case
but
merely
a
member
of
the
class
who
admittedly
would
be
bound
by
the
decree.
now,
the
real
--
mr.
perry
hubbard
i
am
sure
that
there
is
such
a
duty
in
existence,
yes,
sir.
mr.
perry
hubbard
yes,
sir.
mr.
perry
hubbard
yes,
sir.
mr.
perry
hubbard
i
certainly
accept
this,
yes,
that
if
he
had
had
actual
knowledge
of
this
order
--
mr.
perry
hubbard
that
it
would
have
been
his
duty
so
to
do,
absolutely.
mr.
perry
hubbard
yes,
sir.
mr.
perry
hubbard
yes,
sir.
not
only
does
it
not
show
that
he
had
notice,
but
he
unequivocally
states
in
his
deposition
and,
in
his
response
to
this
court,
that
he
did
not
have
notice.
the
more
interesting
question
from
a
legal
point
of
view,
i
believe,
involves
whether
or
not,
in
the
event
this
court
should
determine
that
a
further
exploration
of
the
question
of
possible
contempt
should
be
made
in
this
case
whether
that
exploration
should
be
made
in
this
court
or
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
middle
district
of
alabama.
it
is
our
position
that
the
solicitor
general
has
adopted
the
correct
recommendation
to
this
court
and
that
a
proper
investigation
would
be
in
the
united
states
district
court.
first,
in
this
respect,
the
order
which
is
--
mr.
perry
hubbard
yes,
sir?
mr.
perry
hubbard
no,
i
mean,
if
there
is
to
be
a
further
hearing
on
ascertainment
judicially
of
the
fact.
mr.
perry
hubbard
no,
no.
mr.
perry
hubbard
it
is
our
position
really
that
the
order
involved
is
the
order
of
the
district
court,
and
that
if
there
is
a
contempt
that
it
is
essentially
a
contempt
of
the
district
court.
mr.
perry
hubbard
no,
sir,
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
perry
hubbard
yes,
sir.
i
think
that's
entirely
possible,
and
i
think
this
is
entirely
the
correct
procedure.
mr.
perry
hubbard
no,
sir,
i
don't
think
--
mr.
perry
hubbard
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
hear
you.
mr.
perry
hubbard
no,
sir.
i
believe
that
it
would
be
entirely
correct
for
this
court
to
direct
that
the
legal
effect
of
what
was
accomplished
was
to
revitalize
the
order
of
the
district
court
just
as
it
would
have
had
an
appeal
that
had
been
taken
in
a
supersedious
file
to
preserve
intact
the
order
of
the
lower
court
and
that
this,
indeed,
is
the
order
that
is
involve
and
remanded
to
the
district
court
for
a
determination
and
in
accordance
with
the
indications
of
the
circumstances.
the
question
of
whose
order
it
is,
is
frankly
without
precedence.
i
have
been
unable
to
find
any
case
that
says
--
that
is
sufficiently
comparable
to
be
authority
one
way
or
the
other
in
this
case.
the
merrimack
case,
obviously,
holds
that
one
act
may
be
a
contempt
of
the
orders
of
both
courts.
this,
however,
is,
i
believe,
a
different
type
of
act
from
that
which
is
involved
in
ship,
and
ship
is
substantially
the
only
precedent
for
contempts
in
this
court.
the
effect
there
was
--
of
the
act
complained
of
was
to
completely
defeat
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court
so
as
to
render
ineffective
any
judgment
that
it
might
render.
here,
obviously,
this
court
has
the
power
to
completely
adjudicate
this
matter
and
give
effect
to
its
order.
so,
this
is
not
the
type
of
act
which
would
frustrate
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court
to
adjudicate
the
controversy.
now,
there
is
a
second
consideration.
the
united
states
district
court
has,
indeed,
assumed
jurisdiction
on
the
motion
of
the
united
states
and
has,
since
the
action
has
been
pending
in
this
court,
issued
an
order
enjoining
the
effectuation
of
the
election
and
has
preserved
the
status
quo
as
it
exists.
during
the
pendency
of
this
appeal,
a
number
of
depositions
have
already
been
taking
there,
that
court
views
that
it
still
has
and
is
exercising
jurisdiction
in
this
case.
finally,
i
would
cite
to
the
court
the
expressions
of
mr.
justice
black
in
the
barnet
case,
in
which
he
comments
upon
the
respective
functions
of
trial
and
of
appellate
courts
and
points
out,
in
some
instances,
the
impracticality
of
undertaking
a
factual
investigation
in
this
court.
particularly,
is
this
true
in
view
of
the
obvious
necessity
that
if
a
hearing
is
conducted
here,
it
must
be
conducted
by
and
before
a
commissioner,
not
as
a
proceeding
for
this
court.
and,
if
the
federal
rules
which
give
credence
and
presumptions
favorable
to
the
findings
of
trial
judges
taken
on
evidence
taken
orally
before
them
has
a
basis,
then
the
trying
of
a
case
before
the
judges
on
oral
testimony
is
more
apt
to
result
on
a
correct
result
than
would
perhaps
be
accomplished
by
a
hearing
before
a
commissioner.
there
are
other
arguments
that
could
be
advanced.
however,
by
way
of
summary,
let
me
say
that,
insofar
as
the
factual
issue
is
concerned,
it
is
our
sincere
position
that
judge
herndon's
ignorance
of
the
order
of
this
court
is
merely
an
unfortunate
breakdown
in
communications
and
that
he
failed
genuinely
to
receive
notice
or
knowledge
of
that
order.
the
history
of
the
man,
i
believe,
showed
that
had
he
had
notice
of
it,
that
he
indeed
would
have
complied
with
it.
mr.
perry
hubbard
the
history,
with
regard
to
the
may
5
primary
and
with
regard
to
the
absentee
ballot
shown
on
the
record,
yes.
mr.
perry
hubbard
it
shows
that
in
may
--
on
may
5
primary
in
alabama,
each
of
the
not
presently
ndpa
candidates
was
placed
on
the
ballot
for
the
same
office.
mr.
perry
hubbard
no,
sir.
mr.
perry
hubbard
and,
because
in
october
when
someone
did
dispute
the
right,
when
the
absentee
ballot
was
printed,
during
the
effectiveness
of
the
district
court
order
the
name
did
appear
on
the
absentee
ballot,
despite
that
it
was
a
contest
then.
mr.
perry
hubbard
with
regard
to
that,
if
i
may,
judge
herndon
graduated
from
law
school
some,
probably,
10
or
15
years
ago.
he's
never
practiced
law.
he
was
employed
by
a
corporation
not
as
a
lawyer.
mr.
perry
hubbard
yes,
sir?
mr.
perry
hubbard
from
a
--
mr.
perry
hubbard
from
a
factual
point
of
--
mr.
perry
hubbard
--
view,
yes,
sir.
i
have
tried
to
find
some
case
which
defined
that
propriety
of
issuing
a
rule
to
show
cause,
but
i've
been
unable
to
locate
one.
mr.
perry
hubbard
but,
from
a
legal
point
of
view,
i
think
this
does
not
consider
the
fact
as
to
the
proper
forum
for
the
investigation.
mr.
perry
hubbard
yes,
sir.
i've
chosen
my
brief
--
mr.
perry
hubbard
surely.
mr.
perry
hubbard
thank
you.
mr.
perry
hubbard
45
minutes.
mr.
perry
hubbard
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
here
in
behalf
of
the
defendant
in
a
petition
for
rule
to
show
cause,
james
dennis
herndon.
i
will
direct
my
remarks
only
to
the
issues
as
involved
him.
the
question
presently
presented
to
this
court
is
on
motion
of
the
appellants
for
a
rule
to
show
cause
why
judge
herndon
should
not
be
a
judge
in
contempt
of
this
court.
as
has
been
previously
pointed
out,
this
inquiry
is,
in
part,
a
factual
inquiry
and
is,
in
some
respect,
a
question
of
law
or
procedure.
i
consider
it,
at
this
time,
premature
in
the
absence
of
a
full
investigation
of
the
facts
to
undertake
to
argue
to
this
court
the
facts
of
the
alleged
contempt.
i
would
like
to
point
out
only
this.
that,
in
the
democratic
primary
in
may
of
1968,
judge
herndon,
by
virtue
of
the
duties
of
his
office,
was
required
to
have
the
ballot
printed
for
this
election.
in
that
election,
the
ndpa
candidates
ran
and
also
the
candidates
who
were
ultimately
the
nominees
of
the
regular
democratic
parties.
these
were
the
only
two
candidates
running
in
these
--
in
the
democratic
primary.
and,
at
this
time,
there
was
no
pending
suit,
no
judicial
compulsion,
no
coercion,
no
commotion.
nevertheless,
without
any
question,
without
any
problem,
these
names
were
all
placed
on
the
ballot
by
judge
herndon.
the
race
was
run
without
event.
the
county
officials
asked
and
obtained
election
observers
and,
to
assure
the
proper
conduct
of
the
election,
this
was
done
and
the
election
was
held
with
--
uneventfully.
subsequently,
in
september,
a
certificate
of
mass
meeting
as
to
the
nomination
by
mass
meeting,
these
ndpa
candidates,
was
filed
with
judge
herndon.
no
additional
qualification
or
designation
out
of
the
corrupt
practices
act
was
filed.
however,
a
suit
was
filed
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
middle
district.
that
court
entered
an
order,
a
copy
of
which
was
served
upon
judge
herndon,
directing
that
he
include
the
ndpa
candidates
on
the
ballot.
during
the
pendency
of
this
order,
a
temporary
restraining
order
by
the
us
district
court
for
the
middle
district,
it
became
necessary
by
virtue
of
time
limits
to
print
the
absentee
ballot
which
is
required
to
be
available
substantially
in
advance
of
the
time
that
the
regular
ballot
is
available.
and,
with
the
--
for
the
absentee
ballot
for
this
election,
where
he
had
in
his
hand
and
was
aware
of
the
order
of
the
district
court,
was
printed
so
as
to
include
the
ndpa
candidates.
it
was
only
after
he
was
served
with
--
by
the
clerk
of
the
us
district
court
with
a
copy
of
its
order
dissolving
the
temporary
restraining
order,
that
the
ballot
for
the
general
election
was
printed.
now,
mr.
morgan
has
suggested
that
this
printing
was
unusual.
mr.
perry
hubbard
that
was
on
october
14.
mr.
perry
hubbard
it
was
actually
ordered
by
him
on
the
14th.
it
was
apparently
delivered
on
about
the
17th.
and,
mr.
morgan
has
suggested
that
this
was
an
unusually
early
printing
of
the
ballot.
actually,
i
think
that
an
investigation
of
the
fact
will
demonstrate
that
this
was
one
of
the
last
ballots
to
be
printed,
that
the
printer
had
been
insisting
on
our
going
ahead
and
finalizing
the
order
and
that
it
was
done
when
this
order
--
the
dissolution
of
the
temporary
restraining
order
was
made
or
received
by
him.
now,
it
is
not
controverted
in
this
case
that,
subsequent
to
that
time,
there
was
no
delivery
of
any
order.
this
is
not
the
problem,
nor
do
we
convert
--
controvert
that
if
he
had
actual
knowledge
of
the
order
that
he
would
be
equally
in
contempt
of
it
as
if
one
had
been
served
on
him.
this
is
not
the
problem
at
all.
judge
herndon
has
by
his
response
to
the
rule
to
show
cause
or
the
motion
for
rule
to
show
cause,
as
asserted,
that
he
was
absolutely
without
knowledge
of
the
applicability
of
the
restoration
of
this
temporary
restraining
order
in
its
effect
as
to
him
and
to
local
candidates.
and,
this
is
the
factual
question
that
will
be
presented.
mr.
perry
hubbard
yes,
sir.
mr.
perry
hubbard
yes,
sir.
mr.
perry
hubbard
i
believe,
probably
in
the
interim.
as
i
recall
his
deposition,
he
said
that
he
thought
he
saw
some
memorandum
in
the
paper
or
some
article
in
the
paper
on
the
15
or
there
abuts.
mr.
perry
hubbard
yes,
sir.
mr.
perry
hubbard
so
far
as
i
know,
he
took
none.
mr.
perry
hubbard
no,
sir.
mr.
perry
hubbard
not
only
do
his
records
fail
to
reflect
any
communication,
i
don't
think
anyone
--
mr.
perry
hubbard
no,
sir.
in
this
record,
there
is
no
suggestion
that
he
received
a
direct
communication
of
any
description
from
any
state
office
or
officer.
mr.
perry
hubbard
yes,
sir.
it
was
his
understanding
that
the
order
had
applicability
to
the
presidential
electors
and
statewide
candidates.
now,
if
your
honor
will
recall,
this
was
the
primary
or
thrust
of
the
case
at
this
time,
apparently,
in
the
reporting
of
it,
and
i
have
since
read
the
same
articles
and
they
are
susceptible
to
that
interpretation.
mr.
perry
hubbard
i
don't
know
whether
they
had
been
--
they
were
not
incorporated
into
the
copy
of
the
deposition
that
i
had,
though
they
were
read
into
judge
herndon's
deposition.
mr.
perry
hubbard
no,
sir,
they
are
not.
mr.
perry
hubbard
in
the
typed
record,
yes,
sir.
they
were
read
into
judge
herndon's
depositions.
mr.
perry
hubbard
yes,
sir?
mr.
perry
hubbard
yes,
sir,
he
did.
mr.
perry
hubbard
i
don't
have
--
it
is
sufficient
familiarity
to
say
with
assurance
whether
it
was
done
in
precisely
those
terms.
knowing
now
what
i
know
about
the
case,
it
certainly
says
that
there
was
a
restoration
of
the
order.
mr.
perry
hubbard
yes,
sir.
mr.
perry
hubbard
yes,
sir.
mr.
perry
hubbard
no,
sir.
now,
with
regard
to
the
--
there
is
in
the
brief
a
suggestion
with
regard
to
constructive
notice
by
virtue
of
notification
of
the
attorney
general's
office,
and
i
would
like,
in
passing,
to
mention
that
judge
herndon
was
not
a
party,
i
don't
believe,
in
the
original
proceeding
that
was
commenced
in
the
middle
district.
that
was
a
class
action
which
was
begun
against
a
named
probate
judge
and
said,
in
all
other
probate
judges
who
are
similarly
situated,
he
would
not
--
of
course,
a
named
party,
he
will
not
serve
and
did
not
appear
in
that
case.
and,
it
is
our
position
here
that
the
notice
to
someone
who
represents
the
parties
to
a
suit
is
not
notice
to
a
member
of
a
class
who
is
not
actually
a
party
to
the
suit.
in
other
words,
there
is
no
--
and
i
can
understand
why
there
may
have
been
no
direct
communication
because,
indeed,
judge
herndon
was
not
a
defendant
in
the
case
but
merely
a
member
of
the
class
who
admittedly
would
be
bound
by
the
decree.
now,
the
real
--
mr.
perry
hubbard
i
am
sure
that
there
is
such
a
duty
in
existence,
yes,
sir.
mr.
perry
hubbard
yes,
sir.
mr.
perry
hubbard
yes,
sir.
mr.
perry
hubbard
i
certainly
accept
this,
yes,
that
if
he
had
had
actual
knowledge
of
this
order
--
mr.
perry
hubbard
that
it
would
have
been
his
duty
so
to
do,
absolutely.
mr.
perry
hubbard
yes,
sir.
mr.
perry
hubbard
yes,
sir.
not
only
does
it
not
show
that
he
had
notice,
but
he
unequivocally
states
in
his
deposition
and,
in
his
response
to
this
court,
that
he
did
not
have
notice.
the
more
interesting
question
from
a
legal
point
of
view,
i
believe,
involves
whether
or
not,
in
the
event
this
court
should
determine
that
a
further
exploration
of
the
question
of
possible
contempt
should
be
made
in
this
case
whether
that
exploration
should
be
made
in
this
court
or
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
middle
district
of
alabama.
it
is
our
position
that
the
solicitor
general
has
adopted
the
correct
recommendation
to
this
court
and
that
a
proper
investigation
would
be
in
the
united
states
district
court.
first,
in
this
respect,
the
order
which
is
--
mr.
perry
hubbard
yes,
sir?
mr.
perry
hubbard
no,
i
mean,
if
there
is
to
be
a
further
hearing
on
ascertainment
judicially
of
the
fact.
mr.
perry
hubbard
no,
no.
mr.
perry
hubbard
it
is
our
position
really
that
the
order
involved
is
the
order
of
the
district
court,
and
that
if
there
is
a
contempt
that
it
is
essentially
a
contempt
of
the
district
court.
mr.
perry
hubbard
no,
sir,
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
perry
hubbard
yes,
sir.
i
think
that's
entirely
possible,
and
i
think
this
is
entirely
the
correct
procedure.
mr.
perry
hubbard
no,
sir,
i
don't
think
--
mr.
perry
hubbard
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
hear
you.
mr.
perry
hubbard
no,
sir.
i
believe
that
it
would
be
entirely
correct
for
this
court
to
direct
that
the
legal
effect
of
what
was
accomplished
was
to
revitalize
the
order
of
the
district
court
just
as
it
would
have
had
an
appeal
that
had
been
taken
in
a
supersedious
file
to
preserve
intact
the
order
of
the
lower
court
and
that
this,
indeed,
is
the
order
that
is
involve
and
remanded
to
the
district
court
for
a
determination
and
in
accordance
with
the
indications
of
the
circumstances.
the
question
of
whose
order
it
is,
is
frankly
without
precedence.
i
have
been
unable
to
find
any
case
that
says
--
that
is
sufficiently
comparable
to
be
authority
one
way
or
the
other
in
this
case.
the
merrimack
case,
obviously,
holds
that
one
act
may
be
a
contempt
of
the
orders
of
both
courts.
this,
however,
is,
i
believe,
a
different
type
of
act
from
that
which
is
involved
in
ship,
and
ship
is
substantially
the
only
precedent
for
contempts
in
this
court.
the
effect
there
was
--
of
the
act
complained
of
was
to
completely
defeat
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court
so
as
to
render
ineffective
any
judgment
that
it
might
render.
here,
obviously,
this
court
has
the
power
to
completely
adjudicate
this
matter
and
give
effect
to
its
order.
so,
this
is
not
the
type
of
act
which
would
frustrate
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court
to
adjudicate
the
controversy.
now,
there
is
a
second
consideration.
the
united
states
district
court
has,
indeed,
assumed
jurisdiction
on
the
motion
of
the
united
states
and
has,
since
the
action
has
been
pending
in
this
court,
issued
an
order
enjoining
the
effectuation
of
the
election
and
has
preserved
the
status
quo
as
it
exists.
during
the
pendency
of
this
appeal,
a
number
of
depositions
have
already
been
taking
there,
that
court
views
that
it
still
has
and
is
exercising
jurisdiction
in
this
case.
finally,
i
would
cite
to
the
court
the
expressions
of
mr.
justice
black
in
the
barnet
case,
in
which
he
comments
upon
the
respective
functions
of
trial
and
of
appellate
courts
and
points
out,
in
some
instances,
the
impracticality
of
undertaking
a
factual
investigation
in
this
court.
particularly,
is
this
true
in
view
of
the
obvious
necessity
that
if
a
hearing
is
conducted
here,
it
must
be
conducted
by
and
before
a
commissioner,
not
as
a
proceeding
for
this
court.
and,
if
the
federal
rules
which
give
credence
and
presumptions
favorable
to
the
findings
of
trial
judges
taken
on
evidence
taken
orally
before
them
has
a
basis,
then
the
trying
of
a
case
before
the
judges
on
oral
testimony
is
more
apt
to
result
on
a
correct
result
than
would
perhaps
be
accomplished
by
a
hearing
before
a
commissioner.
there
are
other
arguments
that
could
be
advanced.
however,
by
way
of
summary,
let
me
say
that,
insofar
as
the
factual
issue
is
concerned,
it
is
our
sincere
position
that
judge
herndon's
ignorance
of
the
order
of
this
court
is
merely
an
unfortunate
breakdown
in
communications
and
that
he
failed
genuinely
to
receive
notice
or
knowledge
of
that
order.
the
history
of
the
man,
i
believe,
showed
that
had
he
had
notice
of
it,
that
he
indeed
would
have
complied
with
it.
mr.
perry
hubbard
the
history,
with
regard
to
the
may
5
primary
and
with
regard
to
the
absentee
ballot
shown
on
the
record,
yes.
mr.
perry
hubbard
it
shows
that
in
may
--
on
may
5
primary
in
alabama,
each
of
the
not
presently
ndpa
candidates
was
placed
on
the
ballot
for
the
same
office.
mr.
perry
hubbard
no,
sir.
mr.
perry
hubbard
and,
because
in
october
when
someone
did
dispute
the
right,
when
the
absentee
ballot
was
printed,
during
the
effectiveness
of
the
district
court
order
the
name
did
appear
on
the
absentee
ballot,
despite
that
it
was
a
contest
then.
mr.
perry
hubbard
with
regard
to
that,
if
i
may,
judge
herndon
graduated
from
law
school
some,
probably,
10
or
15
years
ago.
he's
never
practiced
law.
he
was
employed
by
a
corporation
not
as
a
lawyer.
mr.
perry
hubbard
yes,
sir?
mr.
perry
hubbard
from
a
--
mr.
perry
hubbard
from
a
factual
point
of
--
mr.
perry
hubbard
--
view,
yes,
sir.
i
have
tried
to
find
some
case
which
defined
that
propriety
of
issuing
a
rule
to
show
cause,
but
i've
been
unable
to
locate
one.
mr.
perry
hubbard
but,
from
a
legal
point
of
view,
i
think
this
does
not
consider
the
fact
as
to
the
proper
forum
for
the
investigation.
mr.
perry
hubbard
yes,
sir.
i've
chosen
my
brief
--
mr.
perry
hubbard
surely.
mr.
perry
hubbard
thank
you.
