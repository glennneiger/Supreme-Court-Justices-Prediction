but
we
certainly
didn't
spell
out
any
of

we?

what

of

isn't
it?
justice

it
certainly
--
justice

certainly,
cases
which
make
it
quite
blatant
that
the

actually
be
in
contempt
of

the

and
this

well,
i

just

for

justice

got
it?
justice

did

consider

justice

well,
there's
been
no

one

as

justice
byron

white
district

just
upheld
the
law.
justice

white
and
the
only
candidate
they

justice
byron

they
were

in

justice

that's
what

candidate
who
had
on

under

was
that
issue
raised
in
the
district

at

was
the

made
that

did
satisfy
the
--
all
of

requirements?
justice
byron

white
well,
if
it
hadn't
been,
i
suppose
the
three-judge
court
would've
decided
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
because
it
isn't
in
the
opinion
of
the
lower

i
gather.
justice
byron

white
it's
just
an
issue
of
state
law
that
the
three-judge
court,
like
they
usually
do,
can
decide.
justice
byron
r.
white
absence
some
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
was
it
an
issue?
justice
byron

as
just
whether
or
not
under
alabama
law
that
the
one
filing
does
the
job.
justice
byron
r.
white
another
point,
judge
johnson
agreed,
as
i
remember,
that
the
law
--
the
practices
of
the
law
were
valid
on
its
face.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
justice
said
that
it'd
been
in
its
application
in
these
circumstances
that
it
had
been
discriminatorily
applied
and
he
based
that,
i
take
it,
on
the
fact
that
this
was
the
first
time
in
history
that
the
law
had
been
invoked
by
the
secretary
of
state.
he
said
it
is
the
first
time
that
the
law
has
ever
been
invoked
by
the
--
justice
byron

white
secretary
of

is
that
true
or
is
that
contrary
to
the
testimony
of
the
secretary
of
state?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
most
of
the
filings
would've
had
to
have
been
with
the
probate
judge
anyway,
wouldn't
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
with
the
probate
judge?
justice
byron

white
were
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
about
historically
in
terms
of
probate
judges
invoking
this
law
in
their
own
rather
than
leaving
it
to
opposing
candidates
to
invoke?
justice
byron

either
if
he
suddenly
decided.
justice
byron

does
he
--
did
he
say
he
insists
on

being
complied
with?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
saw
the
order.
you
saw
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
mean
we
shouldn't
decide
here
now
that
if
there
was
a
contempt,
it
was
a
contempt
of
the
district
court's
order
and
may
be
a
contempt
of
this
court's
order?
justice
byron

what
should
we
leave
to
the
district

in
the
first
instance,
the
question
of
whose

if
any

justice

do
you

mr.

i
would

the

either
decided

under

a
filing
for

satisfies
the

now,
which
--
justice
byron

white
why
didn't
they
decide
it?
justice
byron

white
i
would
suppose
that
if
you
had
made
it
an

they
would've
been
required
or
at

they
should've
decided
this

of

justice

that's
not

it?
justice

you

you

was
the
unconstitutionality
on

justice
byron

white
yes.
justice
byron

white
let's
assume
that

construed
the

to

that
the

does
not
satisfy

for

let's
assume
that
had

was
decided.
what
would

then?
justice
byron

white
so,
what
would
you
say?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know.
what
if
the
alabama
court
said
that
they
hadn't
filed?
they
must
make
another
filing
when
they
ran
on

of
another
party.
justice
byron

white
well,
what
about
the
filings
with
the
probate
--
what
about
the
local
candidates?
justice
byron

white
well,
how
could
she
speak
to
the
local
judges
when
they're
the
ones
who
have
to
make
the
certification?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.

what
if
the
court
happened
to
agree
with
judge
johnson
but,
ultimately,
has
commented
that
judge
herndon
was
not
in
contempt?
what
relief
would
be
appropriate,
a
new
election?
justice
byron
r.
white
whether
or
not
judge
herndon
is
in
contempt,
somehow,
there
was
a
failure
to
give
to
--
bring
the
court's
order
home
to
those
who
should
understand
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
the

decides,
however,
that

are
valid?
justice
byron
r.

or
at

that
one
of
them
is
valid?
justice
byron

white
then,
what
about
judge
herndon?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
doesn't
make
it
irrelevant,
that
one
of
the
statutes
is
irrelevant
to
--
justice
byron

white
well,
how
about
the
statute
--
if
the
court
holds
at

one
these
statutes
is
valid,
what
about
relief?
there
was
still
a
violation.
there
still
might
have
been
a
violation
of
the

order.
justice
byron

say,
they
held
the
corrupt

constitutional.
justice

and
that
