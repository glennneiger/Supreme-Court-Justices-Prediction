john
m.
harlan
as
a
matter
of
it,
those
certificates
were
filed
certificates,
(inaudible)
in
the
end-result
in
court?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i'd
like
to
ask
you
a
question.
as
i
understand
it,
the
restraining
order
in
its
face
expressly
states
that
you
would
have
on
your
ballot
three
--
two
sets
of
presidential
electors
compose
of
different
people
but
each
of
them
pledged
to
humphrey
and
muskie?
justice
john
m.
harlan
two
sets.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
then
you
have
a
third
set
pledged
to
wallace
and
again
a
different
set
presidential
electors?
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
that
right?
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
now
unless
--
i'd
like
to
ask
you
another
question.
assuming
for
a
moment
that
the
presidential
--
the
restraining
order
were
modified
so
as
to
leave
the
--
so
as
to
eliminate
the
electors
of
the
appellants
here,
but
to
leave
their
candidates
on
the
ballot
for
other
offices,
would
that
--
what
effect
would
that
have
on
the
election?
could
that
be
done?
in
other
words,
could
you
eliminate
from
the
ballots
the
presidential
electors
of
these
appellants
and
leave
their
other
candidates
on?
justice
john
m.
harlan
would
it
be
more
difficult
than
taking
all
the
names
off?
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
a
question
mr.
morgan?
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
it
clear
on
the
ballot
that
each
of
these
two
groups
of
electors
reflects
humphrey
and
muskie?
justice
john
m.
harlan
when
does
the
voter
know,
how
does
he
find
out
to
vote
this
way?
justice
john
m.
harlan
are
there
any
valid
alabama
decisions,
judicial
decisions,
asking
him
to
if
he
designates
himself?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what's
the
alabama
law
with
respect
to
a
man
who
gets
on
the
ballot
indirectly
and
these
elections
attended
by
the
man
failed
to
comply
with
the
corrupt
practices
act?
justice
john
m.
harlan
mr.
redden,
what's
your
answer
to
the

voting
rights
argument?
justice
