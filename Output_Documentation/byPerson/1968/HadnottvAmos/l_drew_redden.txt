mr.
l.
drew
redden
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
the
probate
judges
in
the
various
counties
are
in-charge
with
the
preparation
of
the
ballots
in
their
particular
county.
i
think
the
court
will
readily
understand
as
has
been
pointed
out
that
this
is
not
a
complete
ballot,
as
the
ballot
will
vary
from
county
to
county
because
of
the
fact
that
there
are
local
and
county
officers
up
for
election
during
1968.
so
that
on
the
ballot
in
each
county
you
would
have
your
statewide
offices,
you
would
have
only
one
of
these
candidates
for
congress.
we
have
eight
congressional
districts
in
the
appropriate
districts,
so
that
you
have
a
different
ballot
in
each
county.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
sir?
mr.
l.
drew
redden
there
is
only
--
if
i
understand
the
question,
there
is
only
one
ballot
in
each
county.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
it
would
be
in
any
state
of
the
union.
to
answer
your
question,
i
would
have
to
say
that
you
would
not
have
a
uniform
situation
with
reference
to
the
degree
of
preparation
of
the
ballot
from
county
to
county.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
i
have
some
hearsay
information
solely.
remember
that
in
the
portions
of
the
state,
voting
is
on
voting
machines,
those
have
been
prepared
i'm
sure
in
a
great
many
cases
following
the
district
court's
order.
in
some
other
instances
the
ballots
are
being
printed
by
printers
at
the
order
of
the
probate
judge.
there
is
no
uniformity
right
now.
they
are
in
various
stages
of
preparation.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
yes.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
no
sir,
i
would
have
to
say
that
a
good
many
do
not,
that
probably
more
do
not
than
do.
we
have
made
contact
since
the
court
entered
the
order
here
with
as
many
--
as
we
have
been
able
to
contact
to
advise
them
of
the
issuance
of
this
order
and
to
have
them
to
undertake
to
do
whatever
they
can
do
with
regard
to
trying
to
wait
and
trying
to
find
a
printer
who
can
put
them
in
a
position
of
compliance.
but
really
we
are
getting
very
close
to
the
election
and
i
am
sorry
that
i'm
unable
to
tell
the
court
precisely
what
the
situation
is
in
each
county.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
67.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
yes.
might
i
state
one
thing
about,
said,
i
have
been
requested
by
counsel
for
the
intervenor
who
was
not
allotted
anytime
to
make
a
presentation
today
simply
to
state
to
the
court
that
a
brief
has
been
filed
on
behalf
of
the
intervenors
to
state
that
the
issues
raised
by
the
intervenors
apply
only
to
the
present
and
to
electors,
not
for
the
local
officers
that
they
are
in
accord
with
the
decision
of
the
court
below
in
favor
of
appellees
here
but
they
desire
me
only
to
make
the
further
representation
to
the
court
that
they
consider
that
there
are
inefficient,
raised
its
issues
which
were
not
disposed
off
the
law
for
the
reason
that
it
was
unnecessary
to
reach
them
because
of
the
decision.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
that's
my
understanding.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
i
would
not
represent
that
to
the
court.
i
would
say
that
the
officials
will
make
every
effort
to
comply
with
any
order
of
this
court
makes.
i'm
not
sure
that
it
will
be
possible
in
every
case,
but
i
make
no
assertion
of
impossibility.
i'm
not
prepared
to.
i
would
like
to
reply
directly
to
some
of
the
points
raised
here.
in
the
first
place,
the
corrupt
practices
act
of
the
state
of
alabama
has
been
the
law
of
that
state
since
1915.
it's
been
the
law
for
53
years.
the
two
sections
under
attack
by
the
appellants
in
this
case
have
not
had
any
substantial
change
throughout
that
long
period
of
time.
the
portion
with
which
they
failed
to
comply
was
a
provision
of
that
law
which
states
that
within
five
days
after
the
announcement
of
a
candidacy
that
the
candidate
is
required
to
file
a
designation
of
a
committee
to
receive
contributions
to
handle
its
funds.
the
rest
of
the
law
imposes
a
considerable
obligation
on
those
individuals.
it
may
be
the
candidate
himself,
it
may
be
persons
he
designates
but
the
law
imposes
a
considerable
obligation
on
them
with
reference
to
the
receipt
of
funds,
the
disbursement
of
funds
and
ultimately
the
accounting
for
funds.
and
the
second
section
that
they
attacked
contains
a
mandatory
provision
that
if
a
candidate
fails
to
comply
with
that
provision,
his
name
will
not
appear
on
the
ballot.
now
it
is
that
simple
when
count
--
mr.
l.
drew
redden
that
cost
money?
mr.
l.
drew
redden
they
frequently
have,
yes.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
generally,
i
would
say
that
the
expenditure
of
funds
has
been
on
a
consorted
basis
if
i
understand
that
question.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
no
sir,
there
is
no
question.
they
are
provisions
of
course
governing
all
officers
with
reference
to
the
amount
of
money
that
can
be
extended
in
particular
raises
for
particular
purposes
in
that.
it
does
apply
to
them
without
any
question.
but
this
was
not
complied
with
in
the
main.
as
counsel
has
stated,
there
were
some
few
who
filed
a
form
that
was
printed
for
this
party
at
the
head
of
it.
it
contains
a
statement,
declaration
of
intent,
act
number
243,
national
democratic
party
of
alabama.
it
was
a
prepared
form.
their
chairman
testified
that
he
was
aware
of
all
of
the
requirements
of
the
garrett
act
that
he
was
aware
of
the
requirements
of
the
corrupt
practices
act
that
he
disseminated
the
information
concerning
the
necessary
compliance
to
his
county
chairman
and
to
others
and
disseminated,
distributed
the
forms.
and
they
simply
did
not
comply.
now
the
complaint
is
made
that
the
secretary
of
state
acted
in
disqualifying
particular
candidates
as
an
afterthought.
i
point
this
out
to
the
court
and
what
i
say
here
supports
i
think
not
only
the
corrupt
practices
act
but
i
would
ask
the
court
to
consider
it
in
relation
to
the
garrett
act
also.
you're
being
asked
to
consider
the
garrett
act
as
an
isolated
piece
of
legislation
erected
solely
for
the
purpose
of
disqualifying
candidates
for
office.
i
submit
to
the
court
that
this
is
not
the
situation.
it
is
part
of
an
integrated
portion
of
statutes
concerning
declarations
of
candidacy
and
qualification
for
example.
for
i
believe
30
years,
those
persons
who
wish
to
qualify
as
candidates
for
parties
conducting
primaries
have
been
required
to
do
so
by
march
1st
of
the
year
in
the
election.
everyone,
the
only
effect
of
the
garrett
act
is
to
say
that
an
independent
candidate
for
office
or
a
candidate
for
office
of
a
party
not
conducting
a
primary
must
file
a
declaration
of
intent
by
the
same
day.
now,
this
can't
be
equated
in
my
judgment
with
what
this
court
struck
down
in
rolls.
there,
a
petition
as
i
recall
the
facts
containing
430,000
names
would
have
had
to
be
signed
and
presented
by
february
the
7th,
90
days
ahead
of
the
primary.
what
has
to
happen
here
is
that
every
person
who
desires
to
be
a
candidate
for
office
in
alabama
must
by
march
1,
file
a
declaration
of
intent.
it
doesn't
have
to
be
supported.
it's
not
a
petition
containing
signatures.
it
is
his
statement
and
it
applies
to
everyone.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
the
first
to
use
the
in
may.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
unless
he
were
nominated
by
convention
that
had
chosen,
of
a
group
that
had
chosen
delegates
on
primary
election
day.
you
see
the
integration
--
mr.
l.
drew
redden
i
would
say
there
would
be
one
instance
in
which
it
would
be
possible.
let
me
carry
just
a
step
further
the
statutory
provision.
as
i
stated
every
one
regardless
whether
he
desire
to
run
as
independent,
candidate
for
primary
party
or
candidate
for
non-primary
party
must
declare
by
march
1st.
now
the
statute
further
provides
that
whatever
form
of
nomination
is
utilized.
that
must
be
accomplished
on
the
first
tuesday
in
may.
for
example,
mr.
justice
fortas
referred
to
the
democratic
and
republican
parties
conducting
primary,
the
fact
is
that
the
republican
party
conducts
primaries
only
in
two
or
three
counties
in
alabama.
there
are
no
statewide
primaries.
it
nominates
by
mass
meetings.
the
law
states
that
the
mass
meeting
will
be
held
or
rallies
or
compasses
or
whatever
they
may
be
called
will
be
held
on
primary
election
date
which
is
this
year
may
the
7th
being
the
first
tuesday.
the
primary
is
held
on
the
same
date
so
that
the
republicans
go
through
by
the
mass
meeting.
their
nomination
procedure
on
that
date.
now,
i
say
that
there
would
be
a
degree
of
possibility
for
this
reason.
a
party
might
at
that
time,
that
is
on
the
first
tuesday
may
elect
its
delegates
to
a
state
convention
for
example.
that
would
meet
for
the
purpose
of
nominating
candidates.
i
would
have
to
acknowledge
i
believe
that
he
probably
would
have
lost
his
right
to
some
degree
to
run
for
a
county
office.
there
would
still
be
(inaudible)
available
to
them
and
conceivably
if
they
simply
elected
delegates
to
a
nominating
convention
at
the
county
level
that
would
still
be
open.
there
would
be
a
degree
in
which
it
is
open.
so
that
on
may
the
7th,
the
nominations
are
made
or
delegates
are
elected
to
conventions.
this
is
required
of
everyone.
there
is
no
distinction
if
the
man
is
an
independent
candidate.
the
petition
that
the
law
requires
of
him
to
submit
has
not
been
required
to
have
been
submitted
on
march
1st,
it
must
be
submitted
by
may
7th.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
all
of
the
legislation
that
i
am
speaking
of
with
the
exception
of
the
garrett
act
has
been
the
law
since
1947
all
along.
though
some
of
the
statutes
to
which
i
have
referred
dated
back
to
1931,
i
believe
is
the
date
of
origin.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
the
march
provision
changing
the
date
from
may
for
those
who
were
not
candidates
in
a
primary
to
march
was
enacted
in
1967
and
effective
in
may
i
believe
of
the
year
perhaps
--
mr.
l.
drew
redden
it
was
not
submitted.
of
course,
i'm
using
this
example
showing
that
this
is
only
a
part
of
the
law.
the
corrupt
practices
act
of
course
had
been
the
law
as
i
said
since
1950
going
forward
with
the
dates
and
actions
synchronized
may
the
7th.
the
certifications
of
the
nominations
which
were
made
on
may
7
are
by
nominating
conventions
held
subsequent
to
may
7
through
delegates
elected
on
that
date
must
be
submitted
60
days
prior
to
the
election.
now
one
thing
that
mr.
morgan
has
pointed
out
is
this
that
mrs.
amos,
the
secretary
of
state,
he
says,
as
an
afterthought,
as
an
afterthought
said
“well
you
also
failed
to
comply
with
the
corrupt
practices
act
to
the
state
of
alabama.”
i
do
make
this
observation
to
the
court.
there
were
67
other
defendants
in
the
case
below.
every
probate
judge
in
the
state
of
alabama
was
made
a
defendant.
the
only
people
who
were
required
to
file
was
mrs.
amos,
the
secretary
of
state
at
all
where
the
candidates
was
statewide
office.
now
if
we
assume
that
it
would
be
valid
to
state,
that
mrs.
amos
as
an
afterthought
said
“oh,
by
the
way,
you
didn't
comply
with
the
corrupt
practices
act”
which
i
submit
she
had
a
perfect
right
to
do
if
in
fact
they
did
not
comply.
that
statement
can't
be
made
and
has
not
been
made
of
the
67
probate
judges.
there's
no
contention
that
they
have
said
anything
that
stops
them
to
say
that
we
must
comply
with
this
law
which
says
you
cannot
be
on
the
ballot
if
you
have
not
complied
with
the
corrupt
practices
act
and
it's
just
as
simple
as
that.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
yes,
sir.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
we
must
certify
them.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
yes.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
the
same
thing.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
yes.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
that's
right,
yes
sir.
and
that
is
the
procedure
now
because
the
garrett
act
just
applies
at
one
end.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
they
state
that
they
had
mass
meetings
on
may
the
7th.
there
were
meetings
of
5
people,
6
people,
various
counties
and
that
really
is
not
an
issue
here
in
this
case
that
they
may
exert
nominations.
now
we
have
67
counties
and
as
counsel
has
stated
to
you,
what
they
are
stating
for
example
with
reference
to
the
straight
ticket
argument
that
this
people
have
a
right
to
have
straight
ticket
vote
available
to
them
is
simply
this.
i
pointed
out
that
there
are
67
ballots
in
the
state
because
there
are
67
counties.
there
are
only
17
counties
they
acknowledged
in
which
they
have
any
candidates
who
they
contend
are
qualified.
only
17,
there
are
50
of
the
counties
in
which
there
would
be
no
local
candidates.
in
four
of
the
others
of
the
17,
there
is
only
one.
in
four
others,
there
is
only
two.
now,
i
point
this
out
not
to
disparage
the
effort
but
i
point
this
out
to
make
this
observation
to
the
court
that
they
are
talking
about
straight
ticket
voting
and
a
right
to
vote
a
straight
ticket.
they
can't
vote
a
straight
ticket
for
this
party
and
really
participate
in
this
election
as
electors.
if
they
did
that
and
nothing
else,
then
they
would
be
casting
their
ballot
for
blanks.
and
i
make
this
further
--
mr.
l.
drew
redden
50
out
of
the
67
counties
and
substantially
that
another
17
because
they
are
offering
so
few.
but
i
may
--
mr.
l.
drew
redden
that's
right,
only
one
for
two
and
four
more,
three
and
a
couple
more.
now,
let's
follow
this
just
a
minute.
the
argument
that
there
is
a
right
to
grant
--
to
vote
a
straight
ticket.
i
do
respectfully
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
statute
cited
in
the
appendix
of
our
brief.
they
are
referring
to
section
157
of
title
17
of
the
court
of
alabama.
it
says
that
the
elector,
if
he
desires,
i
believe
those
are
the
words
of
the
statute,
may
vote
a
straight
ticket
by
either
marking
at
the
top
of
the
ballot
or
by
turning
this
leaf.
but
reading
158,
159,
160
and
161,
the
next
one
says,
he
may
if
he
elects,
vote
a
split
ticket
by
marking
in
any
fashion
that
he
chooses.
the
next
one
says
that
in
a
case
where
he
wants
to
vote
a
straight
ticket,
and
there
are
blanks
in
the
call
of
that
party.
he
can
vote
the
straight
ticket
and
then
he
could
go
and
fill
in
those
blanks,
his
ballot
and
his
machine
will
still
be
open
to
vote
for
the
candidates
of
other
parties
where
the
party
that
he
wants
to
support
all
the
candidates
are,
doesn't
provide.
so
we
state
to
the
court
that
effective
participation
in
this
election
would
require
that
they
vote
on
to
some
other
labels
too.
i
think
that
the
ballot
here
is
not
unique,
it's
not
even
unusual.
i
guess
that
the
--
the
format
of
a
ballot
if
there
is
somewhat
mistake
to
state,
i
think
that
this
court
will
recognize
it.
there's
no
scheme
or
device
here
to
confuse.
i
can't
really
understand
the
argument
that
says
on
the
one
hand,
you
won't
let
us
on
the
ballot
so
our
people
can't
vote
a
straight
ticket.
your
ballot
is
so
confusing.
i
think
the
ballot
itself
is
proved
that
is
to
put
easy
to
get
on
the
ballot
in
alabama.
the
prohibition
authority
for
example
has
candidate
as
presidential
elector,
no
other
since
they
attack
the
alabama
independent
democratic
party
for
that.
no
others.
but
it
must
be
very
easy
to
get
on
the
ballot.
and
now,
what
they
are
saying
and
what
they
said
at
the
outset
of
this
court
in
their
argument
was
“we
want
you
to
declare
section
148
title
17
unconstitutional.
and
we
want
you
to
do
it
so
that
these
candidates
for
elector
can
withdraw
and
this
party
can
thereby
substitute
these
people
over
here
so
that
they
will
be
running
under
both
columns.”
and
the
reason
you
have
to
declare
148
unconstitutional
is
so
that
the
vote
can
be
aggregate
here.
and
this
proposal
was
made
in
the
course
of
the
trial
of
this
case
before
three-judge
court
in
montgomery.
counsel
said
“we
represent
to
the
court
that
we're
willing
to
do
this
on
this
condition.”
on
condition
that
this
court
will
declare
section
148
unconstitutional
and
on
the
further
condition
that
these
people
whose
names
we
are
going
to
duplicate
on
this
ballot
and
get
over
here
will
give
their
oath
that
they
won't
withdraw
their
candidacy
which
any
candidate
has
a
right
to
do
under
the
law
until
20
days
before
the
election.
this
is
nomination
at
open
court
however
liberal
the
alabama
laws
maybe
and
i
submit
that
they
all
liberal
with
reference
to
getting
on
our
ballot.
there
is
no
provision
for
that
and
i
don't
really
know
of
the
laws
of
any
other
state
containing
such
a
provision.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
yes
sir,
it
states
that
the
name
of
each
candidate
shall
only
be
on
the
ballot
once
and
only
under
one
emblem.
mr.
schwenn
who
has
just
been
admitted
for
practice
in
this
court
was
a
nominee
of
this
party
for
united
states
senator
and
for
presidential
elector.
mr.
john
davis
whose
name
appears
here
is
running
for
presidential
elector
or
president
of
alabama
public
service
commission
and
for
a
number
of
the
board
of
education
st.
clair
county
or
some
office
of
that
type,
i've
forgotten.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
sir?
mr.
l.
drew
redden
this
would
be
in
the
1930's
law.
it
is
not
of
new
origin.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
no
sir.
i
would
say
that
--
mr.
l.
drew
redden
i
would
say
that
all
of
the
others
that
we
are
talking
about
are
at
least
20
years
old
and
most
of
them
older.
there
might
have
been
some
minute
changes
of
phraseology
but
i'm
speaking
of
the
substance
of
the
law.
i'm
sure
that
the
amount
for
example
that
you
can
spend
in
political
campaigns
has
recognized
inflationary
tendencies
of
the
time
than
has
been
upgraded
from
time
to
time
in
recent
years.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
i
submit
to
the
court
that
it
is
in
effect.
it's
not
in
my
judgment
a
device.
it
comes
within
none
of
the
definitions
of
--
in
my
judgment
of
the
voting
rights
act.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
with
respect
to
voting?
i
submit
that
it
is
not
a
standard
within
the
broad
term
of
procedure,
yes
sir,
certainly
within
a
possible
definition
of
that
term
but
it
is
a
procedure
of
this
nature.
it's
one
that
has
always
been
required.
a
procedure
that
has
always
been
required
and
it
is
only
part
and
an
infinite
decimal
part
of
the
established
procedure
that
has
been
the
law
since
the
turn
of
the
century
it
read
it.
and
all
it
does
is
to
set
a
date
in
which
it
says
that
everyone
was
before
the
act.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
no
sir,
for
the
reason
that
they
have
not
complied
with
the
corrupt
practices
act.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
there
would
be
of
course
the
question
of
individual
qualification
where
special
educational
qualifications
and
things
of
that
sort
of
residence
are
required
in
the
case
of
individual
candidates.
most
of
those
have
been
restored.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
or
under
148.
it
would
certainly
eliminate
the
(voice
overlap)
and
148
prevents
the
representation
that
was
made
to
the
court
in
open
court.
but
the
corrupt
practices
act
since
1915
has
said
within
five
days
of
applicants.
i
would
point
this
out
and
i
started
to
while
going
on,
i'm
glad
you
returned
me
to
it.
these
people
represent
that
they
in
mass
meetings
on
may
the
7th
nominated
candidates.
they
gave
no
indication
of
who
these
people
were
that
they
nominated.
they
first
had
that
they
were
going
to
have
a
state
convention
on
june
the
17th
or
june
the18th.
they
ultimately
have
a
meeting
in
birmingham
on
july
the
20th
at
which
certain
additional
candidates
purportedly
were
nominated.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
no.
the
decision
below
stated
that
there
was
no
basis
for
refusing
to
certify
because
of
the
lack
of
a
mass
meeting
in
madison
county.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
it
is
out
of
this
case
i'm
using
it
only
to
make
the
point.
i'm
reciting
a
chronology
for
this
reason.
that
the
last
nominations
before
that
it
made
would
have
been
made
on
july
the
20th.
the
earliest
ones
would
have
been
made
on
may
the
7th.
there
was
no
certification
of
any
candidates
to
the
secretary
of
state
or
to
the
probate
judge
until
certifications
were
mailed
apparently
all
or
almost
every
one
of
them
from
huntsville
on
september
the
4th
of
1968
arriving
in
the
offices
of
the
probate
judges
and
the
secretary
of
state
on
september
the
5th1968
at
the
last
possible
moment.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
they
were
within
the
60
days,
just
barely
but
--
mr.
l.
drew
redden
if
they
maintained
and
this
is
a
point
i
was
getting
to.
if
they
maintained
that
there
had
been
no
announcement
until
that
moment
of
a
candidacy
established
on
may
the
7th
for
example.
they
didn't
comply
with
that
because
they
didn't
file
their
designation
of
committee
within
five
days
of
that
time.
if
they
maintained
that
even
as
a
statewide
candidates
nominated,
they
say
on
july
the
20th.
if
they
maintained
that
there
was
no
announcement
because
they
kept
it
apparently
pretty
quiet.
that
there
was
no
announcement
of
those
candidacies
of
those
people
nominated
on
july
the
20th
until
they
file
these
papers.
they
didn't
satisfy
then
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
has
held
in
a
case
where
a
candidate
declared
or
the
word
made
public
by
filing
this
paper
on
i
think
may
the
3rd
of
that
particular
year.
it
was
the
first
tuesday
in
may
or
he
was
nominated
then
has
held
in
that
case
that
that
was
the
time
of
the
announcement
of
candidacy.
that's
when
he
became
a
candidate
and
when
the
time
started
to
run
for
him.
what
i
am
merely
saying
is
that
is
necessary
only
to
assert
this
that
the
things
that
this
party
did
were
done
relative
to
nominations
either
on
may
7
or
july
20
or
september
5.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
no,
sir.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
no
sir.
it
was
not
complied
with
then.
and
the
only
attempt
that
complies
for
most
of
the
candidates,
remember
that
i
have
acknowledged
at
the
outset
that
there
were
a
few
who
utilizing
the
form
printed
by
their
party
and
distributed
to.
there
were
a
few
who
signed
the
designation
of
finance
committee
and
filed
it
with
their
declaration
of
intent.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
i
say
that
that
is
not
direct
and
i
say
that
it's
not
supported
by
the
record
in
this
case
and
i
say
further
that
the
only
testimony
in
this
case
with
reference
to
its
utilization
and
its
enforcement
is
a
testimony
of
j.
paul
meeks
who
is
a
judge
of
probate
of
jefferson
county,
alabama
which
is
the
most
populous
county
in
the
state
and
has
a
population
of
approximately
800,000
people.
that
2,000
compliances
with
this
act
were
filed
in
his
office,
timely
filed
for
this
election.
so
it
has
fallen
into
the
issues.
there
are
four
decisions
of
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
upholding
the
act,
construing
it
to
be
mandatory
before
elections
in
alabama
and
this
i
submit
rule
has
been
approved
by
the
fifth
circuit
at
least
in
a
statement
that
this
is
a
matter
of
state
law
absence
of
constitutional
violation.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
yes,
sir.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
yes,
sir.
and
in
addition
to
that,
they
have
done
opinions
of
the
attorney
general
of
alabama
where
the
responsible
office
of
that
is
a
probate
judge
would
request
an
opinion
of
him
concerning
where
the
particular
person
should
be
placed
on
the
ballot.
so
--
mr.
l.
drew
redden
the
only
compliance
that
they
claim
to
have
made
is
that
in
this
lawsuit,
and
about
the
20th
day
of
september
and
this
is
as
close
as
i
can
take
it.
if
i'm
wrong
counsel
can
correct
it.
it
would
be
no
earlier
than
18th,
19th
or
20th.
there
was
an
attempt
in
this
sense
that
mr.
morgan
as
counsel
for
those
individuals
who
before
delivered
candidacy
set
a
document
to
the
court
and
a
document
to
each
probate
judge
and
i
presume
to
the
secretary
of
state
--
mr.
l.
drew
redden
stating
that
as
their
attorney,
he
was
filing
a
statement
that
each
one
of
them
was
appointing
himself,
his
committee
to
receive
his
funds
and
that's
the
only
attempted
compliance
for
those
who
didn't
use
the
form
and
the
law
requires
--
mr.
l.
drew
redden
completely.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
that's
only
argument
that
they
can
possibly
have.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
three
sets?
mr.
l.
drew
redden
two
sets,
yes.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
yes.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
yes.
and
a
set
pledged
to
nixon
and
agnew.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
i
don't
know
of
any
pledge.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
i
can't
say
that
it
cannot
be
done.
i
would
only
have
to
represent
to
you
that
if
it
can
be
done
it
will
be
an
extremely
difficult
thing
to
accomplish.
i
wouldn't
want
to
represent
further
than
that
because
i
don't
have
the
knowledge
adequate
to
do
it.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
yes,
sir.
for
this
reason,
if
i
may
point
this
out.
the
uniform
removal
can
be
accomplished
in
other
ways
that
are
fairly
simple,
whether
you
use
a
machine
or
a
ballot
but
the
intersplicing
would
be
difficult
toward
here
or
there.
the
district
court
ruled
in
favor
of
the
defendants
on
the
constitutional
issues
and
said
we
exercised
our
discretion
to
refrain
from
deciding
individual
factual
disputes.
those
have
not
been
ruled
on.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
yes,
it
says
a
name
cannot
appear
but
once
on
the
ballot
and
under
only
one
emblem
and
of
course
--
mr.
l.
drew
redden
--
counsel
has
said
that
they
cite
california,
new
york
cases
for
the
proposition.
that's
unconstitutional.
we
submit
to
the
court
that
every
state
that
has
ever
decided
that
question
but
those
two
have
rule
that
such
a
provision
is
constitutional.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
this
is
in
the
30's.
i'm
guessing
so
i
could
define
it
easily.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
argument
that
i
have
proposed
to
make
for
the
appellees
i
represent
here
does
not
cover
the
contempt
question.
judge
herndon
is
separately
represented
on
that
so
i
won't
be
touching
on
that,
and
i
feel
a
little
at
a
disadvantage
on
a
part
of
the
response
for
the
reason
that
i
consider
the
counsel
for
the
appellants,
insofar
as
he
did
refer
to
the
merits
of
this
case,
referred
only
and
then
only
briefly
to
an
attack
on
title
17
section
148
or
the
last
sentence
thereof
and
did
not
make
reference,
as
i
see
is
argument,
to
the
other
matters
that
are
raised
in
brief
and
that
were
raised
in
the
submission
that
the
parties
had
attending
itself
to
the
merits
here
the
last
time.
i
do
consider,
however,
that
the
solicitor
general
in
his
argument
explored
most
of
these
avenues
and
i
want
to
direct
myself,
if
i
may,
to
his
merits.
i
think
that
there's
a
little
misconception
as
to
the
facts
and
i
would
like
to
ask
for
the
court
to
bear
with
me
just
a
moment.
to
go
back
to
the
beginning
of
this
entire
picture
or
facture,
the
solicitor
general
makes
a
point,
for
example,
in
brief
that
this
case
has
now
been
mooted
as
to
the
rights
of
all
persons
except
one,
those
in
greene
county,
who
were
not
on
the
ballot
and
who
the
argument
proceeds
were
due
to
and
placed
on
the
ballot.
and
then,
those
in
three
other
counties:
etowah,
marengo,
and
sumter
counties
who
were
victorious,
some
of
whom
were
opposed
for
these
officers,
some
of
whom
were
not
opposed,
some
of
whom
were
the
only
persons
on
the
ballot
because
the
status
of
their
election
is
affected.
certainly,
we
agree
with
that,
but
we
don't
intend
to
let
the
picture
be
confused
for
this
reason,
that
we
consider
the
third
point
that
the
solicitor
general
mentions
in
brief
to
be
the
most
important
part
--
point
as
far
as
the
state
of
alabama
is
concerned,
and
that
is
a
validity
of
these
statutes,
the
validity
of
the
corrupt
practices
act,
the
validity
of
the
garret
act,
the
validity
of
the
other
statutes
under
attack,
the
question
of
whether
the
garret
act
is
due
to
be
subjected
to
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965,
prior
to
its
efficacy.
those
are
the
questions
in
the
case.
those
are
the
questions
that
gave
rise
to
the
case,
and
that's
what
we
came
here
on
the
first
time
and,
as
far
as
the
state
of
alabama
is
concerned,
we
are
still
here.
now,
this
is
not
to
demean
or
belittle
the
fact
that
this
court
probably
has
to
decide
the
fate
of
particular
people,
that
it
has
to
decide,
for
example,
whether
there
will
be
perhaps
an
election
in
greene
county
or
not,
a
new
election,
maybe
it
has
to
decide
that,
it's
asked
to.
it
has
to
decide
then
perhaps
whether
certain
persons
who
were
elected
under
the
ndpa
ballot
in
these
three
other
counties
are
due
to
continue
holding
their
office,
but
i
think
it
has
to
decide
this
because
it
has
to
decide
the
validity
of
the
statutes
and
then
their
application
to
these
particular
persons.
and,
i
make
this
point
only
to
say
this,
that
the
solicitor
general
is
in
error,
and
i
think
completely
unwillingly,
when
he
says
that
the
negro
candidates,
as
he
says,
the
ndpa
candidates,
because
they
were
not
all
negro,
there
were
some
white
and
some
negro,
but
the
candidates
of
the
national
democratic
party
of
alabama,
he
said,
filed
a
declaration
of
intent
and
a
designation
of
committee
on
march
--
on
or
before
march
1,
1968
and
that
--
then,
he
says
the
white
candidates,
i
have
presumed
by
that
he
means
the
candidates
of
the
regular
democratic
party
of
alabama
for
nomination
in
this
primary,
filed
such
a
statement.
and
then,
he
said,
that
the
law
is
so
unequally
applied,
or
at
least
i
understand
him
to
say
this,
that
the
law
is
so
unequally
applied
in
alabama
that
such
a
filing
was
held
to
be
good
for
all
time
as
far
as
what
he
called
the
white
candidates
were
concerned
and
not
good
so
far
as
what
he
called
the
negro
candidates.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
i
don't
think
that
allegation
has
actually
been
made
before
for
the
reason.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
that's
right.
it's
a
point
--
this
is
a
point
that
i
was
getting
to.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
the
district
court
found
that
the
statutes
under
attack,
one,
were
not
unconstitutional
on
their
face,
two,
were
not
shown
to
have
been
unconstitutionally
applied
and,
three,
the
holding
was
that
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965
was
not
involved.
now,
this,
as
i
understand
it,
is
the
decree
that
was
appealed
from.
it
said
one
other
thing
in
the
decree,
and
that
is
that
it
was
not
then
going
into
the
details.
we
were
dealing
with
123
people,
to
start
with,
not
the
67
the
counsel
speaks
of.
we
were
dealing
with
123
people
and
it
said,
since
we
have
made
these
rules,
then
what
we
are
concerned
with
is
a
question
of
state
law
and
we're
not
going
into
the
detail
of
it.
it
can
be
handled
in
the
customary
fashion,
so
that
it
didn't
make
that
examination,
but
the
point
is
that
the
record
in
this
case
will
reflect
that
counsel's
statement
was
wrong
with
reference
to
the
67,
approximately,
of
the
ndpa
candidates
who
survived
the
original
agreement
that
they
weren't
qualified,
and
this
was
done
by
letters
of
counsel.
the
court
is
familiar
with
that.
it's
in
the
record
in
this
case.
this
was
done
by
letters
of
counsel,
back
and
forth,
written
at
the
order
of
the
court.
it
certainly
is
true
that
some
ndpa
candidates
filed
declarations
of
intent
prior
to
march
1,
and
that
they
filed
on
the
same
form
that
was
used
by
other
candidates
and
that
that
declaration
of
intent
contained
a
designation
of
committee,
and
designated
themselves,
as
counsel
points
out.
now,
some
did
and
some
did
not
with
reference
to
the
six
people
in
greene
county
who
were
left
off
the
ballot.
my
understanding
is,
and
i
believe
that
these
are
the
facts,
that
all
six
of
those
individuals
had
qualified
as
candidates
in
the
democratic
primary
of
the
regular
democratic
party
of
alabama
which
was
held
on
may
7,
1968.
that,
in
that
primary,
there
were
two
candidates
for
each
of
the
position,
one,
the
ndpa
candidate,
these
six,
the
other,
the
candidate
of
the
regular
democratic
party
of
alabama.
so,
it
was
a
two-man
race,
as
i
understand
it,
in
each
one
of
these.
they
filed
identical
papers.
there's
no
question
about
that,
as
far
as
i
know,
and
they
were
placed
on
the
ballot.
they
were
held
to
be
qualified
to
be
on
the
ballot
in
the
democratic
primary.
now,
each
of
these
six
was
defeated
in
the
democratic
primary
and,
though
i'm
not
trying
the
contempt
case,
i
do
point
out,
as
we
noted
in
brief,
that
this
is
an
unrestricted
primary,
that
everyone
is
allowed
to
vote
in
it.
it's
not
a
close
primary.
counsel
in
his
brief
called
alabama
a
no-party
state
when
it
comes
to
holding
its
primary.
so,
i
don't
make
any
brief
for
the
fact
of
who
would've
won
in
november
had
both
parties
been
on
the
ballot
and
campaigning
against
each
other,
but,
in
may,
that
was
the
result.
now,
counsel
makes
a
point
and
i
think
this
is
a
substantial
question.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
yes,
sir.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
yes,
sir.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
that's
right.
counsel
makes
--
the
solicitor
general
makes
a
very
good
point.
i
think
it
raises
a
substantial
question
because
we
were
not
confronted
with
the
particulars,
as
i've
read
before,
but
let
me
illuminate
it
just
a
little
bit.
they
did
file
those
papers,
identifying
themselves,
and
the
law
allows
it
to
be
done
in
this
fashion,
as
a
candidate
of
or
candidate
seeking
the
nomination
of
the
democratic
party
for
a
particular
position
in
the
primary.
now,
what
they
are
maintaining
is
this,
that
on
the
same
day
that
that
election,
that
primary
election,
was
held,
that
the
national
democratic
party
of
alabama
in
that
county
also
conducted
a
mass
meeting
on
the
same
day
because
this
isn't
that
at
which
political
parties
can
nominate
in
alabama,
that
they
conducted
a
mass
meeting.
and,
i
will
be
frank
to
admit
that
i've
learned,
in
this
case,
i
suppose
that
a
mass
meeting
can
be
two
or
more,
but
that's
not
a
part
of
the
issue
here.
that
issue
was
resolved
unfavorably
to
the
position
of
the
appellees
in
the
district
court
in
the
only
point
on
which
decision
was
made
on,
and
we're
not
raising
it
here.
but,
they
represent
that,
on
that
same
day,
they
were
nominated
by
the
national
democratic
party
of
alabama
for
the
same
offices
in
a
mass
meeting.
and,
what
is
said
now
to
the
court
is
that
the
declarations
of
intent
and
the
designation
of
committee
that
they
made
for
the
handling
of
their
finances
for
this
primary
in
which
they
were
eliminated
and
which,
for
all
that
appears,
they
were
no
longer
a
candidate
because
nobody
knew
of
the
candidacy
of
these
people,
these
candidates
and
most
of
the
other
candidates
of
this
party,
until
about
september
5.
and,
i
think
the
court
will
recall
that
the
record
shows
very
clearly
that
the
certifications
of
nomination
descended
from
huntsville,
alabama
simultaneously
by
registered
or
certified
mail
on
the
various
probate
officers
in
the
67
counties
of
alabama
and
in
the
office
of
the
secretary
of
state
of
the
state
of
alabama.
now,
i
don't
know,
when
i
say
to
the
court
i
think
it
has
not
been
ruled
on
alabama,
whether
a
designation
of
committee
under
the
corrupt
practices
act
made
in
a
situation
in
which
a
party
--
an
individual
does
identify
himself
as
a
participant
in
the
primary
election
process
of
one
party
is
an
adequate
compliance
with
the
corrupt
practices
act.
when
he
turns
up
later
to
be,
and
when
he
loses
that
race,
and
turns
up
later
to
be
the
candidate
of
another
party
that
nominated
on
a
different
fashion,
purportedly
on
the
same
day,
where
his
candidacy
itself
was
not
known
for
a
couple
of
months
later
because
it
was
not
declared,
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that.
i
do
suggest
to
the
court
--
mr.
l.
drew
redden
no,
sir.
the
only
things
that
were
filed
after
would
have
been
reports
of
expenditure.
these
would
have
been
separate
reports.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
only
reports
of
expenditure.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
yes,
sir.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
no,
sir.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
only
in
this
fashion,
the
law
provides
that
those
papers
may
be
submitted
to
the
office
of
a
party
where
the
party
conducts
the
primary.
this
will
constitute
a
satisfaction
of
the
garret
act
and
corrupt
practices
act.
the
only
thing
that
has
happened
here
is
that
there's
not
an
identification
of
this
individual
as
a
candidate
after
may
7,
1968
because
he
lost
the
race.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
each
may
legally
designate
candidates
of
that
political
party.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
i
say
that
that's
what
the
appellants
say.
the
appellants
--
mr.
l.
drew
redden
i
say
that
they
say
and
i
assume
it
happened
because
they
say
that
they
were
nominated
by
a
mass
meeting
on
the
same
day
that
they
lost
in
the
primary
election.
that
is
their
allegation.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
yes,
sir.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
well,
that
would
be
a
separate
thing
that
they
contend.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
no,
what
i'm
saying
is
that
there's
nothing
in
the
alabama
case
that
exists.
certainly,
there's
nothing
in
the
alabama
law
that
would
prevent,
as
i
see,
a
person
from
hedging
his
bet,
if
that
is
uncouth
to
say.
he
can
qualify
as
a
candidate
in
the
democratic
primary.
the
law
says
that
if
another
party,
not
holding
a
primary,
is
a
going
to
nominate
candidates
for
office,
it
must
do
it
by
a
mass
meeting,
which
mass
meeting
must
be
held
on
the
same
day
as
a
primary
election.
now,
he
may
also
be
a
candidate
there.
he
can
lose
in
one
and
win
in
one.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
now,
the
law
does
provide
that
he
can
only
be
on
the
ballot
once
and
only
under
one
emblem,
that
he
couldn't
be
the
candidate
of
both
parties.
that,
actually,
if
you're
going
to
say
that
something
has
been
mooted
as
the
solicitor
general
says,
that
question,
well,
has
been
mooted
in
this
case
because
the
only
persons
who
were
on
the
ballot
twice
lost,
as
far
as
i
know.
i'm
not
aware
of
any
instances
in
which
they
won
both
offices,
as
far
as
that
was
concerned.
but,
what
i'm
saying
merely
is
this.
if
this
court
ruled,
for
example,
that
whatever
was
done
by
six
people
from
greene
county
in
order
to
become
candidates
in
the
democratic
primary
in
the
spring
of
1968
constituted
an
adequate
compliance
with
the
provisions
of
the
garret
act
or
the
corrupt
practices
act.
it
is
not
a
basis
for
holding
the
statutes
invalid
or
unconstitutional.
this
is
a
state
of
alabama's
interest.
we're
not
pushing
the
situation
of
a
particular
candidate.
what
i'm
saying
is,
i
recognize
that
there's
a
substantial
question
raised
here
and
one
that
has
not
been
resolved
by
alabama
law,
that
we
have
persons
who
filled
out
these
forms.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
think
the
record
does
not
support
his
conclusion.
the
record
contains
very
little
in
a
substantial
way,
and
i'll
give
the
court
my
recollection
of
it.
the
most
populous
county
in
alabama
is
jefferson
county
or
birmingham.
it
has
approximately
three-quarters
of
a
million,
population.
the
probate
judge
of
that
county,
judge
j.
paul
meeks,
testified
by
deposition
in
the
case,
and
he
testified
that
there
were
approximately
2,000
compliances
with
the
corrupt
practices
act
filed
in
his
office
alone
in
connection
with
the
spring
elections
and
nominations
in
jefferson
county,
that
will
be
the
compliances
for
local
office,
and
that
everybody
files
them.
that,
it
is
checked
and
that
this
is
a
requirement
before
he
was
certified
a
nominee.
the
only
other
testimony
that
i
think
is,
well,
let
me
withdraw
that
--
mrs.
amos,
the
secretary
of
state,
testified
that
these
are
uniformly
filed
in
her
office.
they
are
required
of
the
candidate
before
he's
certified.
now,
dr.
cashion,
who
was
the
state
chairman
of
the
national
democratic
party
of
alabama,
testified
that
his
party
was
aware
of
the
existence
both
of
the
garret
act
and
the
corrupt
practices
act,
was
aware
of
the
requirements,
and
that
they
caused
to
be
printed
and
the
record
contained
some
copies
of
it.
a
form
bearing
the
legend
from
the
printer,
national
democratic
party
of
alabama
or
ndpa
if
i
forget
whether
the
name
or
the
initials
was
used,
but
it
was
printed
at
the
order
of
the
national
democratic
party
of
alabama
containing
the
form
of
declaration
of
intent
which
satisfied
the
requirements
of
the
garret
act
and
the
designation
of
committee,
and
that
these
were
disseminated
to
the
county
chairman
and
they
were
told
of
the
requirements.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
the
only
--
i
think
we
would
be
disadvantaged
to
say
how
often
this
may
happen
for
the
reason
that
you
would
not
know
of
it
unless
the
action
of
the
certifying
official
either
prompted
litigation
or
publicity,
one
of
the
two
problems.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
yes,
sir.
we
have
three
or
four
reported
cases,
all
of
which
are
cited
in
brief,
and
we
have
a
couple
of
opinions
of
the
attorney
general
of
alabama
which
resulted
from
this
type
of
thing,
and
of
course,
this
has
led
to
the
uniform
holding
in
the
cases
that
the
provisions
of
this
act
are
mandatory
when
raised
in
a
direct
proceeding
prior
to
elections
in
alabama.
the
directory
on
there
and
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
has
said
that,
absent
of
constitutional
question,
that
that
is
a
ruling
that
will
be
binding
on
it
and
found
it
to
be
so
but,
as
i
say,
that
the
record,
to
the
extent
that
it
touches
on
the
question
of
enforcement
or
use,
does
not
support
the
dissenting
opinion's
finding.
it
supports
the
majority
opinion's
finding.
i
think
the
cases
do.
now,
i
don't
think
it's
a
crippling
thing
to
this
position
that
judge
johnson
found,
well,
said
most
of
the
time
that
it
has
been
enforced
it
was
not
done
by
the
state
at
its
own
motion.
well,
i
think
it
normally
is
true
that
the
people
who
really
keep
you
strained
in
political
campaigns
are
going
to
be
the
adversaries.
i
mean,
that
they
certainly
are
going
back
to
the
past.
i
don't
think
it
is
disparaging
to
the
law
--
to
the
enforcement
of
the
law
to
say
that
a
private
party
often
has
brought
the
litigation,
but
the
law
has
been
enforced
and
it
has
been
the
law
for
54
years,
since
1915,
almost
essentially
without
change.
but,
we
make
the
point
again
that,
of
course,
we
have
come
down
now
because
of
the
fact
that
the
election
has
been
held,
we've
come
down
to
the
point
where
--
are
those
who
remain,
the
winners
and
those
who
were
left
off
the
ballot,
we
would
say
that
perhaps
some
did
and
some
did
not
execute
these
doctrines.
as
to
the
greene
county
people,
i
think
that
someone,
whether
it's
this
court
or
the
united
states
district
court
in
further
proceedings,
that
this
court
might
order
has
a
substantial
question
to
decide
whether,
under
this
valid
law,
the
corrupt
practices
act,
that
what
was
done
for
the
purposes
of
entering
into
the
democratic
primary,
would
suffice
as
a
designation
of
a
campaign
committee
to
receive
contributions
for
any
other
race
that
that
candidate
might
have
made
during
that
same
year.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
the
failure
to
comply
with
reference
to
this
portion
of
it
would
be
held
where
the
issue
was
first
raised
after
the
election,
not
to
void
the
election,
as
i
read
the
cases.
of
course,
i
do
make
this
point.
that,
though
we
are
standing
now
subsequent
to
the
election,
we
have
been
disputing
with
this
issue
since
september
of
1968,
prior
to
the
election
and
that
period
is
held
mandatory.
now,
i
think
that
there
are
some
other
provisions
of
the
corrupt
practices
act
that
would
affect
the
ability
to
hold
office
after
the
election,
but
i
don't
make
that
point
here
because
they're
not
involved.
but,
we
keep
returning
to
this
point.
we
are
here
to
uphold
the
validity
of
these
statutes.
we
say
that
the
record
shows
that
they
have
not
been
unconstitutionally
applied
and
they
certainly
are
constitutional
on
their
face.
with
reference
to
the
garret
act,
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to
that
very
briefly.
this
court
is
aware
from
the
record
and
the
briefs
and
our
prior
arguments
that
these
--
piece
of
legislation
was
enacted
subsequent
to
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965,
that
the
effect
of
it
is
to
require
anyone
who
desires
to
be
a
candidate
for
office
to
file
a
declaration
of
intent
by
march
1
of
the
election
year.
i
would
like
to
emphasize
at
this
minute
the
full
picture
with
reference
to
the
right
or
ability
of
people
and
political
parties
to
get
on
the
ballot
in
alabama.
i
think
we've
got
a
situation
that's
exactly
the
reverse
of
williams
against
rhodes.
the
point
is
made
by
the
court
there,
that
it's
impossible
or
very
difficult
for
a
new
party
or
smaller
party
or
a
new
large
party
to
get
on
the
ballot
in
ohio,
that
no
provision
was
made
for
write-in
candidacies
and
that
independent
candidacies
were
almost
unknown
under
the
law
of
ohio.
in
alabama,
an
independent
candidate
for
a
local
position
can
get
on
the
ballot
by
having
a
petition
signed
by
25
names,
by
25
voters
in
a
statewide
election
by
300
votes.
now,
the
court
reviewed
and
william
against
rhodes,
the
laws
of
some
of
the
states
with
reference
to
disease
requires
more
than
1%
or
less
than
1%
is
just
minimal.
it's
a
fraction,
or
if
a
political
party,
that
party
could
nominate
by
primary
or
by
mass
meeting
or
caucus,
as
it's
called.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
yes,
sir.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
announcement.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
announcement
of
the
candidacy.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
that
would
very
likely
be
true
because,
unless
they
did
something
that
would
amount
in
contemplation
of
the
law
to
an
announcement
of
his
candidacy.
i
would
think
that
where
there's
--
lets'
say
that
there's
no
report
of
the
mass
media
that
is
held
private,
it's
not
reported,
and
that
there's
not
activity
which
would
amount
in
substance
to
an
announcement
of
candidacy.
in
other
words,
if
i'm
running
for
sheriff,
i
may
announce
it
by
virtue
of
my
campaign
activity
as
opposed
to
some
formal
announcement.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
yes,
sir.
there
is
that
requirement.
the
law
simply
fixes
the
dead
end
or
far
end
time
within
which
it
must
be
done,
which
is
at
least
60
days
prior
to
the
election.
i
believe
that's
the
law
of
the
general
elections
and
it's
55
days
prior
primary
elections.
the
same
sort
of
thing,
but
that
it
must
be
done
by
that
far
end.
that's
when
the
certification
must
be
made.
that
is
the
last
date.
in
other
words,
what
you
would
say
happen
in
some
of
these
cases
where
nomination
was
by
mass
meeting
occurring
may
7,
1968,
that
nothing
was
said
about
it
until
september
5
when
a
certification
of
nomination
was
sent
either
to
the
probate
office
or
to
the
secretary
of
state's
office,
depending
on
whether
it
was
a
state
or
local
office.
now,
also,
the
law
allows
that
candidates
may
be
nominated
by
conventions
where
the
delegates
to
the
convention
also
were
chose
in
these
caucus
held
on
may
7.
in
other
words,
the
origin
of
nomination
has
to
be
on
may
7
or
the
party
may
hold
a
primary.
now,
of
the
requirements
of
the
law,
the
most
stringent
in
alabama,
far
and
away,
are
the
primary.
a
party
who
--
a
political
party
nominating
by
caucus
of
mass
meeting
has
no
fixed
format
to
follow,
the
law
simply
says
to
be
held
on
that
day,
that
is
the
primary
election
day,
and
to
be
at
or
in
an
immediate
vicinity
of
a
voting
place:
in
a
hall
room
or
open
space,
i
believe
it
says,
and
that's
it.
it
does
say
that
the
report
of
the
nominations
must
be
signed
by
the
chairman,
i
believe,
presiding
at
the
meeting
and
the
secretary
of
the
meeting,
which
was
not
done
in
the
great
many
of
these
cases,
but
no
one
undertook
to
disqualify
anybody
for
failure
to
do
that,
so
that,
the
primary
election
law
is
the
most
stringent.
the
party
holding
the
primary
has
the
most
requirements
to
meet.
now,
it
has
long
been
the
law
in
alabama
that
a
person
seeking
to
run
in
the
primary
election
must
file
his
declaration
of
intent
by
march
1
of
that
election
year.
everything
else
has
been
geared
to
march
1.
a
political
party
eligible
to
hold
a
primary,
but
desiring
not
to
hold
one,
and
to
nominate
back
in
convention
or
caucus
or
mass
meeting
must
make
known
by
approximately
march
1,
and
this
has
long
been
the
law
that
it
decides
not
to
hold
a
primary
election
and
it
can
go
to
other
route
to
request
nomination.
the
sole
effect
of
the
garret
act
was
to
say
to
the
person
who
seeks
nomination
by
the
party
holding
the
caucus
or
mass
meeting
or
who
seeks
to
get
on
the
ballot
as
an
independent
that,
by
march
1,
the
same
date
on
which
the
great
majority
of
other
candidates
who
are
running
in
the
primaries,
the
same
date
on
which
they
must
make
their
declaration
you
must
file
a
declaration
of
intent
to
become
a
candidate.
some
of
these
people
did.
some
of
these
remaining
persons
did,
some
did
not.
again,
the
district
court
did
not
direct
itself
to
a
finding
among
the
123
people
we
started
off
with
as
to
which
ones
did
or
did
not.
it
simply
said
this
is
a
valid
law.
it's
due
to
be
complied
with.
and,
it
held
that
it
was
not
subject
to
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965.
then,
its
application
is
a
matter
for
determination
by
the
proper
authority
whether
--
mr.
l.
drew
redden
yes,
sir.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
no,
sir.
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
no.
well,
to
lose
in
the
primary
if
he
seeks
nomination
by
another
vehicle
and
comes
down
to
the
--
mr.
l.
drew
redden
that's
right.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
right.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
or,
conceivably,
as
an
independent
candidate.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
or,
conceivably,
even
as
an
independent
candidate
had
be
moved
--
mr.
l.
drew
redden
no,
--
mr.
l.
drew
redden
--
it
has
not.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
we
take
the
position
that,
in
the
first
place,
if
the
district
court
examined
this,
it's
finding
is
correct.
i
think
that
--
mr.
l.
drew
redden
yes,
sir.
of
course,
this
court
has,
i
assume,
under
consideration
at
this
time
the
three
mississippi
cases,
and
i'm
not
aware
of
any
decision
that
has
come
out
on
that
yet.
i
think
that
out
of
the
three,
for
example,
if
i
can
extent
just
a
moment
comparing
them
with
our
case,
and
i
may
get
the
name
mixed
up
with
the
facts
but,
in
one
of
these
cases,
as
i
recall,
the
mississippi
law
was
changed
to
make
an
elective
office
an
appointive
office,
office
of
the
superintendent
of
education
in
11
counties
in
mississippi.
this,
i
can
equate
on
the
facts
with
this
case.
and,
another
election
was
changed
from
a
district
election
of
board
of
county
commissioners
or
some
similar
office
to
an
at
large
election.
but,
in
one
case,
and
this
is
the
whitley
against
williams,
you
had
a
statute
which
apparently
did
four
things.
one
of
which
--
only
one
of
which
is
what
the
garret
act
does.
the
statute
fairly
established
to
the
rule
that
no
person
who
had
voted
in
the
primary
election
could
run
as
an
independent
candidate
in
the
general
election.
well,
this,
of
course,
is
not
part
of
alabama
law.
they
require
independent
candidates
to
qualify
to
run
in
the
general
election
as
the
same
time
as
candidates
must
qualify
to
run
in
the
primary
election.
now,
this
is
what
the
garret
act
almost
does,
but
not
quite.
the
garret
act
requires
that
he
declare
his
intent
to
be
a
candidate.
now,
whatever
acts
of
qualification
or
selection
by
petition
may
be
involved,
it
does
not
require
him
to
do
that
at
that
time.
there,
it
most
applied
by
tallying
the
number
of
signatures
of
qualified
electors
and
then
it
had
some
verification
requirements.
i
think
that
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965
is
fifteenth
amendment-oriented
throughout.
i
think
that
just
about
every
section
of
the
act,
with
a
possible
exception
of
section
1973
(c),
makes
specific
reference
to
the
fifteenth
amendment
and
the
protection
of
fifteenth
amendment
rights.
and,
of
course,
that
section
is
applied
only
in
locals
where
it
has
been
found
that
those
rights
have
been
violated
and
that
there
has
been
a
finding
through
the
process
they
had
established
that
there's
going
to
be
--
that
there
will
be
examiners
and
that
the
other
things
will
take
place
provided
for
there.
now,
i
say
in
that
context
that
you
can't
find
or
justify
finding
that
the
garret
act
which
does
only
one
thing,
and
that
is
it
gives
everybody
who
desires
to
be
a
candidate
for
an
office
the
same
starting
time
to
do
only
one
thing
that
is
not
to
become
the
nominee,
but
it
is
to
declare
his
intent
to
become
a
candidate
and
to
freeze
in
place,
in
effect,
then
that
for
at
least
that
election
period.
but,
it
creates
or
systematizes
law
that
has
existed
for
a
long
time,
and
it's
not
a
black
versus
white
proposition.
95%
of
the
people
who
run
for
public
office
have
had
to
comply
with
that
since
about
--
that
time
schedule
since
about
1945.
i
forget
when
the
march
1
requirement
was
put
in.
maybe
it's
a
little
earlier
than
that.
and,
this
merely
systematizes
a
system
its
--
which
itself
is
very
liberal,
which
resulted
in
seven
parties
being
on
the
ballot
in
alabama
this
last
election,
plus,
a
column
for
independence,
plus
a
column
varieties
to
such
an
extent
that
the
complaint
is
made
here
that
the
ballot
is
too
confusing
because
it
is
easy
to
get
on.
and,
we
maintain
that
the
district
court
was
right
in
its
decision
that
the
voting
rights
act
does
not
govern.
of
course,
we
recognize
that
if
this
court
held
to
the
contrary,
it
would
not
be
a
ruling
that
the
act
was
invalid.
it
would
have
the
effect
of
suspending
its
application
for
a
period
of
time
until
its
validity
could
be
determined.
we
understand
that,
but
we
do
press
a
point
that
the
district
court
was
right.
i
don't
know
of
any
other
decisions
than
these
four
plus
the
trust
or
a
trussal
--
the
trussell
case
on
this
point
and
i
--
and
in
related
cases,
and
i
think
that
all
of
them
with
that
one
exception
are
to
the
effect
that
it
did
not
apply.
i'd
like
to
make
only
a
few
other
points
with
reference
to
the
other
statutes.
i
assume
that
counsel
for
the
appellants
will
argue
the
provisions
of
title
17
section
125
of
the
code
of
alabama
which
he
says
that
constitutional
rights
are
being
deprived
of
appellants
because
they
are
not
allowed
to
select
officials
for
the
polling
places.
well,
there
are
six
polling
officials
at
each
polling
place.
this
law
that's
under
attack
provides
that
where
two
or
more
lists
of
suggested
polling
officials
are
submitted
by
political
parties,
that
the
list
submitted
by
the
parties
having
the
highest
receive
--
the
two
parties
receiving
the
highest
number
of
votes
in
the
last
election
will
be
used
to
appoint
the
voting
officials
and
they'll
come
from
those
two
parties.
maybe
this
is
moot
as
to
last
election,
but
i
would
agree
that
if
something
like
this,
if
an
attack
on
a
statute
like
this
could
have
the
effect
of
avoiding
an
election,
then
somebody
should
say
whether
it's
constitutional
or
not,
whether
it's
valid
or
invalid.
counsel
says
we
wouldn't
want
to
be
back
the
next
time
with
reference
to
it,
well,
i
simply
point
out
that
not
everybody.
we
had
seven
parties.
we
have
six
polling
officials
at
a
voting
place.
well,
from
the
beginning,
somebody
had
to
be
eliminated.
somebody
couldn't
have
one.
but,
secondly,
everyone
can
have
a
representative.
the
statutes
which
we
cite
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief
point
out
that
every
candidate,
an
independent,
every
party
is
entitled
to
a
watcher
who
has
right
to
the
access,
the
polls,
to
stand
there
to
observe
the
operation,
and
not
only
that,
to
be
present
when
the
votes
are
counted,
the
right
to
observe
the
count
of
the
votes,
the
right
to
see
the
ballot,
the
right
to
observe
the
tabulation.
and,
we
say
that
this
is
probably
the
weakest
argument,
actually,
that
they
make.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
yes,
sir.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
i
don't
--
i
have
absolutely
no
recollection
of
it
as
an
issue.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
first
one
issue
that
came
up
with
reference
to
some
can
--
mr.
l.
drew
redden
right.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
though
they
undertook
to
decide
no
issues
of
state
law,
actually,
in
this
case.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
i
don't
recall
it
being
raised
by
the
pleadings
at
all.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
there
was
raised
a
parallel
issue
that
was
not
decided,
which
probably
now
is
moot
as
to
some
candidates,
and
that
is
a
fact
that
a
person
would
declare
as
a
candidate
for
one
numbered
position
and
ultimately
be
nominated
or
become
a
candidate
for
another
numbered
position
from
the
same
title
of
office,
for
example,
elector
or
member
of
county
commissioners.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
yes,
sir.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
who
responded.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
i
think
that
you
would
have
to
say
that
the
only
answer
probably
that
the
testimony
gives
to
that
is
a
general
answer.
i
don't
think
that
the
testimony
of
the
secretary
of
state
said
“here
are
cases
in
which
i
have
refused
of
my
own
motion
to
accept.”
i
think
she
said
that
“they
always
are
examined.
we
always
require
compliance
with
this
act.
we
don't
accept
or
certify
people
who
have
not
complied
with
the
act.”
i
don't
think
that
any
examples
were
given
or
any
names
were
called
or
instances
cited
where
that
fact
had
been
the
situation.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
i
think
that
she
also
said
that
she
had,
at
one
time,
indicated
that
they
would
be
accepted.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
that
she
never
did
do
it?
mr.
l.
drew
redden
well,
the
only
thing
that
i
--
mr.
l.
drew
redden
this
ground
of
disqualification
as
an
afterthought?
well,
let
me
just
remind
you
the
timeframe
of
it.
the
disqualification
could
only
come
after
the
certification
was
made,
and
most
of
these
nominations
were
said
to
have
occurred
on
may
7,
1968,
some
on
july
20
where
nomination
was
by
a
convention,
and
none
of
the
certifications
were
made
until
september
10,
1968.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
pardon
me,
i
had
my
date
wrong,
september
5,
1968,
and
this
was
true
whether
the
filing
was
with
the
secretary
of
state
or
with
the
probate
judge.
now,
90%
or
more
of
the
filings
were
with
probate
judges,
who
were
saying
nothing
as
far
as
that
was
concerned.
of
course,
we
made
the
point
in
brief
and
they
talk
about
an
estoppel
that
the
probate
judges
had
not
done
anything
except
receive
by
mail
certificates.
now,
by
september
10,
she
had
acted
and
she
had
declined
to
accept.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
as
to
statewide
offices.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
oh,
yes.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
that's
correct,
but
what
--
in
the
development
of
this
case
and
in
order
to
expedite
his
presentation,
let
me
relate
to
you
how
it
happened.
what
you
are
confronted
with
first
is
a
list
of
perspective
candidates
which,
i
believe,
is
an
approximate
24
at
that
time
in
alabama
of
67
counties
for
local
offices.
then
the
court,
by
order
and
--
required
that
the
parties
communicate
and
that
any
grounds
of
disqualification
of
any
of
those
locals
be
communicated
in
writing,
transmitted
back
and
forth
between
the
parties.
as
result
of
that,
all
of
the
candidates
of
the
seven
counties
were
eliminated.
i
think
we
came
down
to
17
counties
in
which
there
were
counties
for
local
office.
not
all
--
when
i
say
all
of
the
counties,
of
course
they
were
statewide
counties
who
remained
throughout,
but
these
disqualifications
were
based
on
every
statement
of
actual
disqualification.
now,
the
charge
was
made
as
a
blanket
charge
at
that
time
by
the
state
because
it
was
made
before
time
was
even
available
to
check
every
one
them
that
there
was
a
failure
to
comply
the
corrupt
practices
act,
that
there
was
a
failure
to
comply
with
the
garret
act,
and
this
issue
was
raised
in
the
answer.
now,
as
to
other
candidates,
as
to
which
there
was
some
disqualification
that
the
parties
agreed
on,
then
these
were
eliminated.
we
came
down
to
67
candidates
in
17
counties,
i
believe.
maybe
i'm
wrong
a
little
bit.
now,
as
to
that
number,
as
to
that
67,
the
great
majority
did
not
file
the
declaration
of
intent
required
by
the
garret
act
or
the
statement
filed
of
the
requirement.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
with
the
proper
person.
some
of
the
disputed
candidacies
were
still
statewide.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
just
a
few,
yes,
sir.
but,
basically,
it
would
have
been
with
the
probate
judge.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
the
record
does
not
really
develop
anything
on
that,
except
--
mr.
l.
drew
redden
except
the
testimony
of
judge
meeks
that
this
--
that
it's
always
complied
with,
that
this
is
something
that's
done
as
a
matter
of
routine
by
a
candidate
that
he
had
over
$2,000
in
his
office
this
year.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
whether
he
uses
those
words
or
not,
i
think
that
this
would
be
the
fair
intendment
of
his
testimony.
i
frankly
did
not
read
it
recently.
i
don't
think
he
uses
those
words
precisely.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
yes,
i
made
the
argument
here
on
behalf
of
--
mr.
l.
drew
redden
when
i
first
appeared.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
alright,
sir.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
i'd
have
to
confess
that
i
don't
know
how
long
i
have
spoken.
can
you
tell
me,
mr.
hubbard?
mr.
l.
drew
redden
alright.
i
would
say
in
response
to
that,
at
this
time,
that
i
actually
did
not
initiate
any
action.
i
said,
now,
when
i
first
appeared
in
the
case
i
was
counsel
for
mabel
amos,
secretary
of
state.
now,
i
don't
think
that
i
appeared
for
defendants
generally
until
we
operated
on
a
limited
time
schedule
in
the
district
court.
i
think
we
had
a
30-minute
time
for
presentation
and
--
on
that
occasion
for
the
first
time
i
made
the
argument
or
presentation
on
behalf
of
all
defendants
in
that
case,
and
i
did
the
same
thing
in
this
court
where,
on
the
summary
count,
i
think
we
had
30
minutes
to
decide
that
last
occasion.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
that's
correct.
my
office
is
in
birmingham,
alabama.
i'm
not
--
mr.
l.
drew
redden
no.
and,
with
reference
to
what
occurred
after
that,
on
sunday,
i
believe
that
hearing
was
on
friday.
this
court
reached
its
decision
either
friday
or
saturday.
i'm
not
certain
which.
that
--
out
of
which
the
order
came.
on
sunday,
i
had
my
first
knowledge
that
an
order
had
been
writ
--
rendered
by
a
report
in
an
knoxville
newspaper
on
their,
unfortunate
alabama-tennessee
football
game
and
i
saw
the
order
at
that
time.
i
would
have
to
say
--
mr.
l.
drew
redden
i
saw
the
newspaper
at
board,
i'm
sorry.
on
the
sunday
issue
of
the
knoxville
and
i
was
not
quite
clear
really
as
to
what
had
occurred
at
that
time.
i
didn't
see
anything
in
any
birmingham
paper,
i
believe,
until
tuesday
of
that
week.
and
then,
at
some
time
after
tuesday,
would
be
my
recollection,
i
did
receive
--
tuesday
was
a
week
before
election
day.
well,
we
were
here
on
the
18th,
i
believe,
of
october.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
yes,
sir.
so
that
--
mr.
l.
drew
redden
and,
this
art
is
dated
the
19th
of
october.
i
didn't
know
whether
it
was
the
19th
or
the
18th.
and,
i
would
gather,
probably
wednesday
of
that
week,
i
got
a
copy
of
this
which
i
assumed
that
was
received
also
in
the
attorney
general's
office
in
montgomery.
i
didn't
do
anything.
mr.
bolt
called
me
on
friday
or
saturday
of
that
week
and
asked
me
if
i
knew
of
the
order
and
i
told
him
that
i
had
received
this
and
whatever
are
the
knowledge
i
had
of
it.
and,
he
asked
me
whether
the
people
who
would
be
involved
knew
of
it,
and
i
told
him
that
i
had
not
done
anything.
he
told
me
that
--
well,
he
asked
me
if
i
would
object
to
a
letter
being
written
from
his
office
to
the
probate
judge's
or,
i
guess,
to
all,
maybe
to
ms.
amos
too.
i
told
him
i
didn't
have
any
objection,
but
i
didn't
know
what
the
position
the
attorney
general
of
alabama
would
take
about
a
matter
like
that
because
of
the
fact
that
i
was
not
an
attorney
general
and
that
i
didn't
know
what
knowledge
the
various
people
had
of
it.
my
recollection
is
that
this
would've
been
on
a
friday
afternoon
or
saturday
morning,
one
of
the
two,
because
i
know
i
had
the
feeling
that
the
attorney
general's
office
probably
was
not
open
or
available
to
me
at
the
time
being
at
all.
then,
on
monday,
i
call
for
mr.
bookawt
in
montgomery
to
ascertain
whether
it
was
felt
that
everybody
knew
of
it
and
what
action
had
been
taken,
and
i
didn't
know
--
mr.
l.
drew
redden
the
deputy
attorney
general
of
montgomery.
i
didn't
know,
of
course,
whether
orders
--
the
captures
of
the
order
have
been
disseminated
to
various
people.
i
knew
that
there
had
been
or
--
i'm
not
sure
i
was
unaware
that
they
had
been
in
the
district
court.
i
am
now
aware
that
the
district
court
orders
were
disseminated,
and
i
was
unable
to
get
him
--
mr.
l.
drew
redden
that
would
be
right.
then,
i
was
unable
to
get
him
on
that
day.
i
did
talk
to
another
attorney
in
the
office
who
was
not
involved
in
this
case
and
had
no
knowledge
of
it,
except
that
he
said
that
he
would
have
mr.
bookawt
to
get
in
touch
with
me.
and,
my
recollection
is
that
he
and
i
talked
either
once
or
twice.
i
know
we
talked
once
and,
also,
that
he
either
told
me
or
his
office
reported
to
mine
that
he
had
checked
with
the
secretary
of
state's
office.
that
the
only
certification
that
we
had
ever
made
or
the
only
communication
--
mr.
l.
drew
redden
may
it
please
the
court.
i
was
making
a
response
to
a
question
mr.
justice
fortas
asked
and
had
almost
pleaded.
i'll
continue
with
that,
if
i
may.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
i
talked
to
mr.
bookawt,
the
deputy
attorney
general
who,
i
believe,
on
two
occasions
and
he
did
some
checking
apparently
with
the
--
come
to
know
with
the
office
of
the
secretary
of
state,
and
the
message
came
back
that
--
either
to
this
effect
that
all
knew
or
all
had
been
advised
but
i've
come
to
learn
that
the
basis
of
this
probably
was
that
the
secretary
of
state
advised
that
the
only
message
that
she
had
sent
to
the
various
probate
judges,
which
would
be
all
67
probate
judges
not
just
a
few
involved
with
local
offices,
was
the
message
that
pursuant
to
the
decree
of
the
district
court
the
following
persons
would
be
certified,
and
that
she
had
not
ever
rescinded
that
messages
though
there
was
a
period
of
time
within
which
it
--
a
brief
period
of
time,
within
which
it
could've
been
rescinded
and
i
believe
she
testified,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
she
was
working
on
a
rescission
message
at
the
time
she
learned
of
the
order
here,
which
i
believe
she
says
she
recalls
learning
in
all
probability
from
the
attorney
general's
office.
so
that,
what
had
been
sent
to
them,
the
only
message
that
had
been
sent
to
them
from
the
office
of
the
secretary
of
state
was
a
message
that,
pursuant
to
the
order
of
the
district
court,
that
the
following
names
would
be
certified.
of
course,
they
had
received
a
similar
or
--
well,
i
say,
they
were
--
had
received
a
copy
of
the
order
of
the
district
court
which
named
all
of
the
person.
i
assume
that
the
message
from
the
secretary
of
state
did
not
name
any
about
the
statewide
candidates.
the
only
other
pieced
of
information
i
have
with
reference
to
notification
of
us,
and
i
didn't
know
this
at
the
time,
but
mr.
bookawt
testified
when
his
deposition
was
taken
that
he
learned
of
the
fact
that
the
order
had
been
entered
by
this
court
on
saturday
afternoon,
october
19,
which
would
have
been
the
date
that
it
was
entered.
he
was
called
at
his
home
by
the
clerk
or
a
deputy
clerk
in
montgomery
and
was
given
that
message
directly
and
was
asked
to
write
it
down
which,
i
believe,
he
testified
he
did.
this
order
was
entered
approximately
either
16
or
15
days
prior
to
the
date
of
the
election,
depending
on
how
you
would
count
it.
under
the
arrangement,
there
is
a
division
of
time
with
judge
herndon's
counsel.
i
would
like
to
make
just
a
couple
of
other
points,
if
i
may.
one
is
this,
the
solicitor
general
said
that
he
consider
that,
on
the
merits,
there
has
been
a
serious
abridgment
of
the
right
to
participate
in
a
political
process
and
he
relates
three
areas
in
which
he
says
this
abridgment
result.
one
is
the
right
of
association,
the
other,
right
of
candidates
to
run
for
office
and,
the
third,
the
right
for
citizens
to
vote
for
the
candidates
of
their
choice.
maybe
i
had
reiterated
too
often,
but
our
position,
again,
from
the
position
of
the
state
of
alabama,
we
are
not
concerned
with
individual
positions
or
individual
candidates.
we
are
concerned
with
a
validity
of
the
statutes
under
attack
and
also,
of
course,
with
maintaining
that,
as
to
the
facts
of
this
case,
that
they
were
not
unconstitutionally
applied.
now,
those
two
determinations
were
made
by
the
district
court,
and
we
say
that
they
are
due
on
this
record
and
on
the
facts
to
be
upheld.
we
maintain
that
this
case
can't
be
viewed
solely
on
the
basis
of
whatever
history
of
discrimination
there
might
have
been
in
alabama
or
in
any
other
state
in
the
past.
we
acknowledge
that,
through
decisions
of
this
court,
decisions
in
other
places,
the
state
has
stood
convicted
of
particular
acts
that
the
court
has
found
to
be
discriminatory
on
other
occasions.
we
don't
maintain
to
this
court
that
that's
not
true,
but
we
do
maintain
that
to
give
those
an
overwhelming
importance
here
when
we
have
to
view
legislation
in
the
context
of
when
it
came
into
being,
what
its
purposes
are
and,
finally,
how
little
burden
it
imposes.
and,
i
think
that's
one
thing
that,
of
course,
appellants
deemphasize
and
they
tend
to
argue
that
this
creates
a
tremendous
burden
on
one
seeking
to
run
for
public
office.
we
think
that
the
statutes,
the
ballot
itself,
in
alabama,
demonstrate
how
easy
it
is
to
be
a
candidate.
the
district
court,
again,
and
this
point
has
been
brought
up
earlier
today,
made
the
findings
i
have
resided
in
favor
of
appellees
and
then
it
said
that
it
would
not
determine
the
issues
of
state
law
that
were
involved,
having
made
those
findings.
of
course,
as
this
court
has
pointed
out
today
during
this
argument,
it
had
the
authority
to.
it
was
not
a
matter
of
its
saying
that
we
have
no
authority
to
decide
this.
it
determined
that
it
would
not.
now,
we
say
to
this
court
that
that
order
or
judgment
is
due
to
be
upheld.
the
judgment
appealed
from
is
due
to
be
affirmed.
at
the
same
time,
it
would
not
be
improper
in
our
judgment
that
that
court,
that
is
the
district
court,
make
those
determinations
of
state
law
or
that
it
be
directed
through
a
remand
from
this
court
to
make
those
determinations.
but,
as
a
preliminary
event,
there
has
to
be
a
determination
on
the
validity
of
the
statutes
and
on
their
application
in
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
this
case.
state
of
alabama
is
not
here
arguing
to
set
aside
the
election
of
any
particular
individual
who
was
elected
or
to
say
that
if
there
was
someone
kept
off
the
ballot
in
greene
county
who
was
due
to
be
put
on,
that
there
shouldn't
be
a
new
election.
this
is
not
our
position.
our
positions
is,
the
statutes
are
valid,
that
the
record
doesn't
support
any
conclusion
but
that
they
were
validly
enforced
and
applied
in
this
case.
and
then,
there
is
a
matter
of
detail
as
to
the
question
of
whether
a
particular
person
satisfied
the
statute,
whether
a
particular
person's
election
is
due
to
be
upheld.
to
this
point
then,
we
finally
agree
with
the
solicitor
general
that
it
has
become
moot
as
to
everybody
but
these
people.
but,
the
important
question
still
has
to
be
resolved
and
would
have
to
be
resolved
as
long
as
one
of
them
remained,
and
that's
the
validity
of
the
statute.
that's
what
we're
interested
in,
and
we
think
that
the
mechanics
of
the
thing
might
well
be
after
that.
that
this
court
would
direct
if
the
district
court
ascertained
what
should
be
the
result
in
the
application
of
these
valid
statutes
to
the
particular
persons
whose
fate
yet
remains
unsettled.
i
reserve
the
remaining
time.
mr.
hubbard,
thank
you.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
the
probate
judges
in
the
various
counties
are
in-charge
with
the
preparation
of
the
ballots
in
their
particular
county.
i
think
the
court
will
readily
understand
as
has
been
pointed
out
that
this
is
not
a
complete
ballot,
as
the
ballot
will
vary
from
county
to
county
because
of
the
fact
that
there
are
local
and
county
officers
up
for
election
during
1968.
so
that
on
the
ballot
in
each
county
you
would
have
your
statewide
offices,
you
would
have
only
one
of
these
candidates
for
congress.
we
have
eight
congressional
districts
in
the
appropriate
districts,
so
that
you
have
a
different
ballot
in
each
county.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
sir?
mr.
l.
drew
redden
there
is
only
--
if
i
understand
the
question,
there
is
only
one
ballot
in
each
county.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
it
would
be
in
any
state
of
the
union.
to
answer
your
question,
i
would
have
to
say
that
you
would
not
have
a
uniform
situation
with
reference
to
the
degree
of
preparation
of
the
ballot
from
county
to
county.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
i
have
some
hearsay
information
solely.
remember
that
in
the
portions
of
the
state,
voting
is
on
voting
machines,
those
have
been
prepared
i'm
sure
in
a
great
many
cases
following
the
district
court's
order.
in
some
other
instances
the
ballots
are
being
printed
by
printers
at
the
order
of
the
probate
judge.
there
is
no
uniformity
right
now.
they
are
in
various
stages
of
preparation.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
yes.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
no
sir,
i
would
have
to
say
that
a
good
many
do
not,
that
probably
more
do
not
than
do.
we
have
made
contact
since
the
court
entered
the
order
here
with
as
many
--
as
we
have
been
able
to
contact
to
advise
them
of
the
issuance
of
this
order
and
to
have
them
to
undertake
to
do
whatever
they
can
do
with
regard
to
trying
to
wait
and
trying
to
find
a
printer
who
can
put
them
in
a
position
of
compliance.
but
really
we
are
getting
very
close
to
the
election
and
i
am
sorry
that
i'm
unable
to
tell
the
court
precisely
what
the
situation
is
in
each
county.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
67.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
yes.
might
i
state
one
thing
about,
said,
i
have
been
requested
by
counsel
for
the
intervenor
who
was
not
allotted
anytime
to
make
a
presentation
today
simply
to
state
to
the
court
that
a
brief
has
been
filed
on
behalf
of
the
intervenors
to
state
that
the
issues
raised
by
the
intervenors
apply
only
to
the
present
and
to
electors,
not
for
the
local
officers
that
they
are
in
accord
with
the
decision
of
the
court
below
in
favor
of
appellees
here
but
they
desire
me
only
to
make
the
further
representation
to
the
court
that
they
consider
that
there
are
inefficient,
raised
its
issues
which
were
not
disposed
off
the
law
for
the
reason
that
it
was
unnecessary
to
reach
them
because
of
the
decision.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
that's
my
understanding.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
i
would
not
represent
that
to
the
court.
i
would
say
that
the
officials
will
make
every
effort
to
comply
with
any
order
of
this
court
makes.
i'm
not
sure
that
it
will
be
possible
in
every
case,
but
i
make
no
assertion
of
impossibility.
i'm
not
prepared
to.
i
would
like
to
reply
directly
to
some
of
the
points
raised
here.
in
the
first
place,
the
corrupt
practices
act
of
the
state
of
alabama
has
been
the
law
of
that
state
since
1915.
it's
been
the
law
for
53
years.
the
two
sections
under
attack
by
the
appellants
in
this
case
have
not
had
any
substantial
change
throughout
that
long
period
of
time.
the
portion
with
which
they
failed
to
comply
was
a
provision
of
that
law
which
states
that
within
five
days
after
the
announcement
of
a
candidacy
that
the
candidate
is
required
to
file
a
designation
of
a
committee
to
receive
contributions
to
handle
its
funds.
the
rest
of
the
law
imposes
a
considerable
obligation
on
those
individuals.
it
may
be
the
candidate
himself,
it
may
be
persons
he
designates
but
the
law
imposes
a
considerable
obligation
on
them
with
reference
to
the
receipt
of
funds,
the
disbursement
of
funds
and
ultimately
the
accounting
for
funds.
and
the
second
section
that
they
attacked
contains
a
mandatory
provision
that
if
a
candidate
fails
to
comply
with
that
provision,
his
name
will
not
appear
on
the
ballot.
now
it
is
that
simple
when
count
--
mr.
l.
drew
redden
that
cost
money?
mr.
l.
drew
redden
they
frequently
have,
yes.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
generally,
i
would
say
that
the
expenditure
of
funds
has
been
on
a
consorted
basis
if
i
understand
that
question.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
no
sir,
there
is
no
question.
they
are
provisions
of
course
governing
all
officers
with
reference
to
the
amount
of
money
that
can
be
extended
in
particular
raises
for
particular
purposes
in
that.
it
does
apply
to
them
without
any
question.
but
this
was
not
complied
with
in
the
main.
as
counsel
has
stated,
there
were
some
few
who
filed
a
form
that
was
printed
for
this
party
at
the
head
of
it.
it
contains
a
statement,
declaration
of
intent,
act
number
243,
national
democratic
party
of
alabama.
it
was
a
prepared
form.
their
chairman
testified
that
he
was
aware
of
all
of
the
requirements
of
the
garrett
act
that
he
was
aware
of
the
requirements
of
the
corrupt
practices
act
that
he
disseminated
the
information
concerning
the
necessary
compliance
to
his
county
chairman
and
to
others
and
disseminated,
distributed
the
forms.
and
they
simply
did
not
comply.
now
the
complaint
is
made
that
the
secretary
of
state
acted
in
disqualifying
particular
candidates
as
an
afterthought.
i
point
this
out
to
the
court
and
what
i
say
here
supports
i
think
not
only
the
corrupt
practices
act
but
i
would
ask
the
court
to
consider
it
in
relation
to
the
garrett
act
also.
you're
being
asked
to
consider
the
garrett
act
as
an
isolated
piece
of
legislation
erected
solely
for
the
purpose
of
disqualifying
candidates
for
office.
i
submit
to
the
court
that
this
is
not
the
situation.
it
is
part
of
an
integrated
portion
of
statutes
concerning
declarations
of
candidacy
and
qualification
for
example.
for
i
believe
30
years,
those
persons
who
wish
to
qualify
as
candidates
for
parties
conducting
primaries
have
been
required
to
do
so
by
march
1st
of
the
year
in
the
election.
everyone,
the
only
effect
of
the
garrett
act
is
to
say
that
an
independent
candidate
for
office
or
a
candidate
for
office
of
a
party
not
conducting
a
primary
must
file
a
declaration
of
intent
by
the
same
day.
now,
this
can't
be
equated
in
my
judgment
with
what
this
court
struck
down
in
rolls.
there,
a
petition
as
i
recall
the
facts
containing
430,000
names
would
have
had
to
be
signed
and
presented
by
february
the
7th,
90
days
ahead
of
the
primary.
what
has
to
happen
here
is
that
every
person
who
desires
to
be
a
candidate
for
office
in
alabama
must
by
march
1,
file
a
declaration
of
intent.
it
doesn't
have
to
be
supported.
it's
not
a
petition
containing
signatures.
it
is
his
statement
and
it
applies
to
everyone.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
the
first
to
use
the
in
may.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
unless
he
were
nominated
by
convention
that
had
chosen,
of
a
group
that
had
chosen
delegates
on
primary
election
day.
you
see
the
integration
--
mr.
l.
drew
redden
i
would
say
there
would
be
one
instance
in
which
it
would
be
possible.
let
me
carry
just
a
step
further
the
statutory
provision.
as
i
stated
every
one
regardless
whether
he
desire
to
run
as
independent,
candidate
for
primary
party
or
candidate
for
non-primary
party
must
declare
by
march
1st.
now
the
statute
further
provides
that
whatever
form
of
nomination
is
utilized.
that
must
be
accomplished
on
the
first
tuesday
in
may.
for
example,
mr.
justice
fortas
referred
to
the
democratic
and
republican
parties
conducting
primary,
the
fact
is
that
the
republican
party
conducts
primaries
only
in
two
or
three
counties
in
alabama.
there
are
no
statewide
primaries.
it
nominates
by
mass
meetings.
the
law
states
that
the
mass
meeting
will
be
held
or
rallies
or
compasses
or
whatever
they
may
be
called
will
be
held
on
primary
election
date
which
is
this
year
may
the
7th
being
the
first
tuesday.
the
primary
is
held
on
the
same
date
so
that
the
republicans
go
through
by
the
mass
meeting.
their
nomination
procedure
on
that
date.
now,
i
say
that
there
would
be
a
degree
of
possibility
for
this
reason.
a
party
might
at
that
time,
that
is
on
the
first
tuesday
may
elect
its
delegates
to
a
state
convention
for
example.
that
would
meet
for
the
purpose
of
nominating
candidates.
i
would
have
to
acknowledge
i
believe
that
he
probably
would
have
lost
his
right
to
some
degree
to
run
for
a
county
office.
there
would
still
be
(inaudible)
available
to
them
and
conceivably
if
they
simply
elected
delegates
to
a
nominating
convention
at
the
county
level
that
would
still
be
open.
there
would
be
a
degree
in
which
it
is
open.
so
that
on
may
the
7th,
the
nominations
are
made
or
delegates
are
elected
to
conventions.
this
is
required
of
everyone.
there
is
no
distinction
if
the
man
is
an
independent
candidate.
the
petition
that
the
law
requires
of
him
to
submit
has
not
been
required
to
have
been
submitted
on
march
1st,
it
must
be
submitted
by
may
7th.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
all
of
the
legislation
that
i
am
speaking
of
with
the
exception
of
the
garrett
act
has
been
the
law
since
1947
all
along.
though
some
of
the
statutes
to
which
i
have
referred
dated
back
to
1931,
i
believe
is
the
date
of
origin.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
the
march
provision
changing
the
date
from
may
for
those
who
were
not
candidates
in
a
primary
to
march
was
enacted
in
1967
and
effective
in
may
i
believe
of
the
year
perhaps
--
mr.
l.
drew
redden
it
was
not
submitted.
of
course,
i'm
using
this
example
showing
that
this
is
only
a
part
of
the
law.
the
corrupt
practices
act
of
course
had
been
the
law
as
i
said
since
1950
going
forward
with
the
dates
and
actions
synchronized
may
the
7th.
the
certifications
of
the
nominations
which
were
made
on
may
7
are
by
nominating
conventions
held
subsequent
to
may
7
through
delegates
elected
on
that
date
must
be
submitted
60
days
prior
to
the
election.
now
one
thing
that
mr.
morgan
has
pointed
out
is
this
that
mrs.
amos,
the
secretary
of
state,
he
says,
as
an
afterthought,
as
an
afterthought
said
“well
you
also
failed
to
comply
with
the
corrupt
practices
act
to
the
state
of
alabama.”
i
do
make
this
observation
to
the
court.
there
were
67
other
defendants
in
the
case
below.
every
probate
judge
in
the
state
of
alabama
was
made
a
defendant.
the
only
people
who
were
required
to
file
was
mrs.
amos,
the
secretary
of
state
at
all
where
the
candidates
was
statewide
office.
now
if
we
assume
that
it
would
be
valid
to
state,
that
mrs.
amos
as
an
afterthought
said
“oh,
by
the
way,
you
didn't
comply
with
the
corrupt
practices
act”
which
i
submit
she
had
a
perfect
right
to
do
if
in
fact
they
did
not
comply.
that
statement
can't
be
made
and
has
not
been
made
of
the
67
probate
judges.
there's
no
contention
that
they
have
said
anything
that
stops
them
to
say
that
we
must
comply
with
this
law
which
says
you
cannot
be
on
the
ballot
if
you
have
not
complied
with
the
corrupt
practices
act
and
it's
just
as
simple
as
that.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
yes,
sir.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
we
must
certify
them.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
yes.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
the
same
thing.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
yes.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
that's
right,
yes
sir.
and
that
is
the
procedure
now
because
the
garrett
act
just
applies
at
one
end.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
they
state
that
they
had
mass
meetings
on
may
the
7th.
there
were
meetings
of
5
people,
6
people,
various
counties
and
that
really
is
not
an
issue
here
in
this
case
that
they
may
exert
nominations.
now
we
have
67
counties
and
as
counsel
has
stated
to
you,
what
they
are
stating
for
example
with
reference
to
the
straight
ticket
argument
that
this
people
have
a
right
to
have
straight
ticket
vote
available
to
them
is
simply
this.
i
pointed
out
that
there
are
67
ballots
in
the
state
because
there
are
67
counties.
there
are
only
17
counties
they
acknowledged
in
which
they
have
any
candidates
who
they
contend
are
qualified.
only
17,
there
are
50
of
the
counties
in
which
there
would
be
no
local
candidates.
in
four
of
the
others
of
the
17,
there
is
only
one.
in
four
others,
there
is
only
two.
now,
i
point
this
out
not
to
disparage
the
effort
but
i
point
this
out
to
make
this
observation
to
the
court
that
they
are
talking
about
straight
ticket
voting
and
a
right
to
vote
a
straight
ticket.
they
can't
vote
a
straight
ticket
for
this
party
and
really
participate
in
this
election
as
electors.
if
they
did
that
and
nothing
else,
then
they
would
be
casting
their
ballot
for
blanks.
and
i
make
this
further
--
mr.
l.
drew
redden
50
out
of
the
67
counties
and
substantially
that
another
17
because
they
are
offering
so
few.
but
i
may
--
mr.
l.
drew
redden
that's
right,
only
one
for
two
and
four
more,
three
and
a
couple
more.
now,
let's
follow
this
just
a
minute.
the
argument
that
there
is
a
right
to
grant
--
to
vote
a
straight
ticket.
i
do
respectfully
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
statute
cited
in
the
appendix
of
our
brief.
they
are
referring
to
section
157
of
title
17
of
the
court
of
alabama.
it
says
that
the
elector,
if
he
desires,
i
believe
those
are
the
words
of
the
statute,
may
vote
a
straight
ticket
by
either
marking
at
the
top
of
the
ballot
or
by
turning
this
leaf.
but
reading
158,
159,
160
and
161,
the
next
one
says,
he
may
if
he
elects,
vote
a
split
ticket
by
marking
in
any
fashion
that
he
chooses.
the
next
one
says
that
in
a
case
where
he
wants
to
vote
a
straight
ticket,
and
there
are
blanks
in
the
call
of
that
party.
he
can
vote
the
straight
ticket
and
then
he
could
go
and
fill
in
those
blanks,
his
ballot
and
his
machine
will
still
be
open
to
vote
for
the
candidates
of
other
parties
where
the
party
that
he
wants
to
support
all
the
candidates
are,
doesn't
provide.
so
we
state
to
the
court
that
effective
participation
in
this
election
would
require
that
they
vote
on
to
some
other
labels
too.
i
think
that
the
ballot
here
is
not
unique,
it's
not
even
unusual.
i
guess
that
the
--
the
format
of
a
ballot
if
there
is
somewhat
mistake
to
state,
i
think
that
this
court
will
recognize
it.
there's
no
scheme
or
device
here
to
confuse.
i
can't
really
understand
the
argument
that
says
on
the
one
hand,
you
won't
let
us
on
the
ballot
so
our
people
can't
vote
a
straight
ticket.
your
ballot
is
so
confusing.
i
think
the
ballot
itself
is
proved
that
is
to
put
easy
to
get
on
the
ballot
in
alabama.
the
prohibition
authority
for
example
has
candidate
as
presidential
elector,
no
other
since
they
attack
the
alabama
independent
democratic
party
for
that.
no
others.
but
it
must
be
very
easy
to
get
on
the
ballot.
and
now,
what
they
are
saying
and
what
they
said
at
the
outset
of
this
court
in
their
argument
was
“we
want
you
to
declare
section
148
title
17
unconstitutional.
and
we
want
you
to
do
it
so
that
these
candidates
for
elector
can
withdraw
and
this
party
can
thereby
substitute
these
people
over
here
so
that
they
will
be
running
under
both
columns.”
and
the
reason
you
have
to
declare
148
unconstitutional
is
so
that
the
vote
can
be
aggregate
here.
and
this
proposal
was
made
in
the
course
of
the
trial
of
this
case
before
three-judge
court
in
montgomery.
counsel
said
“we
represent
to
the
court
that
we're
willing
to
do
this
on
this
condition.”
on
condition
that
this
court
will
declare
section
148
unconstitutional
and
on
the
further
condition
that
these
people
whose
names
we
are
going
to
duplicate
on
this
ballot
and
get
over
here
will
give
their
oath
that
they
won't
withdraw
their
candidacy
which
any
candidate
has
a
right
to
do
under
the
law
until
20
days
before
the
election.
this
is
nomination
at
open
court
however
liberal
the
alabama
laws
maybe
and
i
submit
that
they
all
liberal
with
reference
to
getting
on
our
ballot.
there
is
no
provision
for
that
and
i
don't
really
know
of
the
laws
of
any
other
state
containing
such
a
provision.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
yes
sir,
it
states
that
the
name
of
each
candidate
shall
only
be
on
the
ballot
once
and
only
under
one
emblem.
mr.
schwenn
who
has
just
been
admitted
for
practice
in
this
court
was
a
nominee
of
this
party
for
united
states
senator
and
for
presidential
elector.
mr.
john
davis
whose
name
appears
here
is
running
for
presidential
elector
or
president
of
alabama
public
service
commission
and
for
a
number
of
the
board
of
education
st.
clair
county
or
some
office
of
that
type,
i've
forgotten.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
sir?
mr.
l.
drew
redden
this
would
be
in
the
1930's
law.
it
is
not
of
new
origin.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
no
sir.
i
would
say
that
--
mr.
l.
drew
redden
i
would
say
that
all
of
the
others
that
we
are
talking
about
are
at
least
20
years
old
and
most
of
them
older.
there
might
have
been
some
minute
changes
of
phraseology
but
i'm
speaking
of
the
substance
of
the
law.
i'm
sure
that
the
amount
for
example
that
you
can
spend
in
political
campaigns
has
recognized
inflationary
tendencies
of
the
time
than
has
been
upgraded
from
time
to
time
in
recent
years.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
i
submit
to
the
court
that
it
is
in
effect.
it's
not
in
my
judgment
a
device.
it
comes
within
none
of
the
definitions
of
--
in
my
judgment
of
the
voting
rights
act.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
with
respect
to
voting?
i
submit
that
it
is
not
a
standard
within
the
broad
term
of
procedure,
yes
sir,
certainly
within
a
possible
definition
of
that
term
but
it
is
a
procedure
of
this
nature.
it's
one
that
has
always
been
required.
a
procedure
that
has
always
been
required
and
it
is
only
part
and
an
infinite
decimal
part
of
the
established
procedure
that
has
been
the
law
since
the
turn
of
the
century
it
read
it.
and
all
it
does
is
to
set
a
date
in
which
it
says
that
everyone
was
before
the
act.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
no
sir,
for
the
reason
that
they
have
not
complied
with
the
corrupt
practices
act.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
there
would
be
of
course
the
question
of
individual
qualification
where
special
educational
qualifications
and
things
of
that
sort
of
residence
are
required
in
the
case
of
individual
candidates.
most
of
those
have
been
restored.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
or
under
148.
it
would
certainly
eliminate
the
(voice
overlap)
and
148
prevents
the
representation
that
was
made
to
the
court
in
open
court.
but
the
corrupt
practices
act
since
1915
has
said
within
five
days
of
applicants.
i
would
point
this
out
and
i
started
to
while
going
on,
i'm
glad
you
returned
me
to
it.
these
people
represent
that
they
in
mass
meetings
on
may
the
7th
nominated
candidates.
they
gave
no
indication
of
who
these
people
were
that
they
nominated.
they
first
had
that
they
were
going
to
have
a
state
convention
on
june
the
17th
or
june
the18th.
they
ultimately
have
a
meeting
in
birmingham
on
july
the
20th
at
which
certain
additional
candidates
purportedly
were
nominated.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
no.
the
decision
below
stated
that
there
was
no
basis
for
refusing
to
certify
because
of
the
lack
of
a
mass
meeting
in
madison
county.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
it
is
out
of
this
case
i'm
using
it
only
to
make
the
point.
i'm
reciting
a
chronology
for
this
reason.
that
the
last
nominations
before
that
it
made
would
have
been
made
on
july
the
20th.
the
earliest
ones
would
have
been
made
on
may
the
7th.
there
was
no
certification
of
any
candidates
to
the
secretary
of
state
or
to
the
probate
judge
until
certifications
were
mailed
apparently
all
or
almost
every
one
of
them
from
huntsville
on
september
the
4th
of
1968
arriving
in
the
offices
of
the
probate
judges
and
the
secretary
of
state
on
september
the
5th1968
at
the
last
possible
moment.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
they
were
within
the
60
days,
just
barely
but
--
mr.
l.
drew
redden
if
they
maintained
and
this
is
a
point
i
was
getting
to.
if
they
maintained
that
there
had
been
no
announcement
until
that
moment
of
a
candidacy
established
on
may
the
7th
for
example.
they
didn't
comply
with
that
because
they
didn't
file
their
designation
of
committee
within
five
days
of
that
time.
if
they
maintained
that
even
as
a
statewide
candidates
nominated,
they
say
on
july
the
20th.
if
they
maintained
that
there
was
no
announcement
because
they
kept
it
apparently
pretty
quiet.
that
there
was
no
announcement
of
those
candidacies
of
those
people
nominated
on
july
the
20th
until
they
file
these
papers.
they
didn't
satisfy
then
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
has
held
in
a
case
where
a
candidate
declared
or
the
word
made
public
by
filing
this
paper
on
i
think
may
the
3rd
of
that
particular
year.
it
was
the
first
tuesday
in
may
or
he
was
nominated
then
has
held
in
that
case
that
that
was
the
time
of
the
announcement
of
candidacy.
that's
when
he
became
a
candidate
and
when
the
time
started
to
run
for
him.
what
i
am
merely
saying
is
that
is
necessary
only
to
assert
this
that
the
things
that
this
party
did
were
done
relative
to
nominations
either
on
may
7
or
july
20
or
september
5.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
no,
sir.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
no
sir.
it
was
not
complied
with
then.
and
the
only
attempt
that
complies
for
most
of
the
candidates,
remember
that
i
have
acknowledged
at
the
outset
that
there
were
a
few
who
utilizing
the
form
printed
by
their
party
and
distributed
to.
there
were
a
few
who
signed
the
designation
of
finance
committee
and
filed
it
with
their
declaration
of
intent.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
i
say
that
that
is
not
direct
and
i
say
that
it's
not
supported
by
the
record
in
this
case
and
i
say
further
that
the
only
testimony
in
this
case
with
reference
to
its
utilization
and
its
enforcement
is
a
testimony
of
j.
paul
meeks
who
is
a
judge
of
probate
of
jefferson
county,
alabama
which
is
the
most
populous
county
in
the
state
and
has
a
population
of
approximately
800,000
people.
that
2,000
compliances
with
this
act
were
filed
in
his
office,
timely
filed
for
this
election.
so
it
has
fallen
into
the
issues.
there
are
four
decisions
of
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
upholding
the
act,
construing
it
to
be
mandatory
before
elections
in
alabama
and
this
i
submit
rule
has
been
approved
by
the
fifth
circuit
at
least
in
a
statement
that
this
is
a
matter
of
state
law
absence
of
constitutional
violation.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
yes,
sir.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
yes,
sir.
and
in
addition
to
that,
they
have
done
opinions
of
the
attorney
general
of
alabama
where
the
responsible
office
of
that
is
a
probate
judge
would
request
an
opinion
of
him
concerning
where
the
particular
person
should
be
placed
on
the
ballot.
so
--
mr.
l.
drew
redden
the
only
compliance
that
they
claim
to
have
made
is
that
in
this
lawsuit,
and
about
the
20th
day
of
september
and
this
is
as
close
as
i
can
take
it.
if
i'm
wrong
counsel
can
correct
it.
it
would
be
no
earlier
than
18th,
19th
or
20th.
there
was
an
attempt
in
this
sense
that
mr.
morgan
as
counsel
for
those
individuals
who
before
delivered
candidacy
set
a
document
to
the
court
and
a
document
to
each
probate
judge
and
i
presume
to
the
secretary
of
state
--
mr.
l.
drew
redden
stating
that
as
their
attorney,
he
was
filing
a
statement
that
each
one
of
them
was
appointing
himself,
his
committee
to
receive
his
funds
and
that's
the
only
attempted
compliance
for
those
who
didn't
use
the
form
and
the
law
requires
--
mr.
l.
drew
redden
completely.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
that's
only
argument
that
they
can
possibly
have.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
three
sets?
mr.
l.
drew
redden
two
sets,
yes.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
yes.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
yes.
and
a
set
pledged
to
nixon
and
agnew.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
i
don't
know
of
any
pledge.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
i
can't
say
that
it
cannot
be
done.
i
would
only
have
to
represent
to
you
that
if
it
can
be
done
it
will
be
an
extremely
difficult
thing
to
accomplish.
i
wouldn't
want
to
represent
further
than
that
because
i
don't
have
the
knowledge
adequate
to
do
it.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
yes,
sir.
for
this
reason,
if
i
may
point
this
out.
the
uniform
removal
can
be
accomplished
in
other
ways
that
are
fairly
simple,
whether
you
use
a
machine
or
a
ballot
but
the
intersplicing
would
be
difficult
toward
here
or
there.
the
district
court
ruled
in
favor
of
the
defendants
on
the
constitutional
issues
and
said
we
exercised
our
discretion
to
refrain
from
deciding
individual
factual
disputes.
those
have
not
been
ruled
on.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
yes,
it
says
a
name
cannot
appear
but
once
on
the
ballot
and
under
only
one
emblem
and
of
course
--
mr.
l.
drew
redden
--
counsel
has
said
that
they
cite
california,
new
york
cases
for
the
proposition.
that's
unconstitutional.
we
submit
to
the
court
that
every
state
that
has
ever
decided
that
question
but
those
two
have
rule
that
such
a
provision
is
constitutional.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
this
is
in
the
30's.
i'm
guessing
so
i
could
define
it
easily.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
argument
that
i
have
proposed
to
make
for
the
appellees
i
represent
here
does
not
cover
the
contempt
question.
judge
herndon
is
separately
represented
on
that
so
i
won't
be
touching
on
that,
and
i
feel
a
little
at
a
disadvantage
on
a
part
of
the
response
for
the
reason
that
i
consider
the
counsel
for
the
appellants,
insofar
as
he
did
refer
to
the
merits
of
this
case,
referred
only
and
then
only
briefly
to
an
attack
on
title
17
section
148
or
the
last
sentence
thereof
and
did
not
make
reference,
as
i
see
is
argument,
to
the
other
matters
that
are
raised
in
brief
and
that
were
raised
in
the
submission
that
the
parties
had
attending
itself
to
the
merits
here
the
last
time.
i
do
consider,
however,
that
the
solicitor
general
in
his
argument
explored
most
of
these
avenues
and
i
want
to
direct
myself,
if
i
may,
to
his
merits.
i
think
that
there's
a
little
misconception
as
to
the
facts
and
i
would
like
to
ask
for
the
court
to
bear
with
me
just
a
moment.
to
go
back
to
the
beginning
of
this
entire
picture
or
facture,
the
solicitor
general
makes
a
point,
for
example,
in
brief
that
this
case
has
now
been
mooted
as
to
the
rights
of
all
persons
except
one,
those
in
greene
county,
who
were
not
on
the
ballot
and
who
the
argument
proceeds
were
due
to
and
placed
on
the
ballot.
and
then,
those
in
three
other
counties:
etowah,
marengo,
and
sumter
counties
who
were
victorious,
some
of
whom
were
opposed
for
these
officers,
some
of
whom
were
not
opposed,
some
of
whom
were
the
only
persons
on
the
ballot
because
the
status
of
their
election
is
affected.
certainly,
we
agree
with
that,
but
we
don't
intend
to
let
the
picture
be
confused
for
this
reason,
that
we
consider
the
third
point
that
the
solicitor
general
mentions
in
brief
to
be
the
most
important
part
--
point
as
far
as
the
state
of
alabama
is
concerned,
and
that
is
a
validity
of
these
statutes,
the
validity
of
the
corrupt
practices
act,
the
validity
of
the
garret
act,
the
validity
of
the
other
statutes
under
attack,
the
question
of
whether
the
garret
act
is
due
to
be
subjected
to
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965,
prior
to
its
efficacy.
those
are
the
questions
in
the
case.
those
are
the
questions
that
gave
rise
to
the
case,
and
that's
what
we
came
here
on
the
first
time
and,
as
far
as
the
state
of
alabama
is
concerned,
we
are
still
here.
now,
this
is
not
to
demean
or
belittle
the
fact
that
this
court
probably
has
to
decide
the
fate
of
particular
people,
that
it
has
to
decide,
for
example,
whether
there
will
be
perhaps
an
election
in
greene
county
or
not,
a
new
election,
maybe
it
has
to
decide
that,
it's
asked
to.
it
has
to
decide
then
perhaps
whether
certain
persons
who
were
elected
under
the
ndpa
ballot
in
these
three
other
counties
are
due
to
continue
holding
their
office,
but
i
think
it
has
to
decide
this
because
it
has
to
decide
the
validity
of
the
statutes
and
then
their
application
to
these
particular
persons.
and,
i
make
this
point
only
to
say
this,
that
the
solicitor
general
is
in
error,
and
i
think
completely
unwillingly,
when
he
says
that
the
negro
candidates,
as
he
says,
the
ndpa
candidates,
because
they
were
not
all
negro,
there
were
some
white
and
some
negro,
but
the
candidates
of
the
national
democratic
party
of
alabama,
he
said,
filed
a
declaration
of
intent
and
a
designation
of
committee
on
march
--
on
or
before
march
1,
1968
and
that
--
then,
he
says
the
white
candidates,
i
have
presumed
by
that
he
means
the
candidates
of
the
regular
democratic
party
of
alabama
for
nomination
in
this
primary,
filed
such
a
statement.
and
then,
he
said,
that
the
law
is
so
unequally
applied,
or
at
least
i
understand
him
to
say
this,
that
the
law
is
so
unequally
applied
in
alabama
that
such
a
filing
was
held
to
be
good
for
all
time
as
far
as
what
he
called
the
white
candidates
were
concerned
and
not
good
so
far
as
what
he
called
the
negro
candidates.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
i
don't
think
that
allegation
has
actually
been
made
before
for
the
reason.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
that's
right.
it's
a
point
--
this
is
a
point
that
i
was
getting
to.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
the
district
court
found
that
the
statutes
under
attack,
one,
were
not
unconstitutional
on
their
face,
two,
were
not
shown
to
have
been
unconstitutionally
applied
and,
three,
the
holding
was
that
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965
was
not
involved.
now,
this,
as
i
understand
it,
is
the
decree
that
was
appealed
from.
it
said
one
other
thing
in
the
decree,
and
that
is
that
it
was
not
then
going
into
the
details.
we
were
dealing
with
123
people,
to
start
with,
not
the
67
the
counsel
speaks
of.
we
were
dealing
with
123
people
and
it
said,
since
we
have
made
these
rules,
then
what
we
are
concerned
with
is
a
question
of
state
law
and
we're
not
going
into
the
detail
of
it.
it
can
be
handled
in
the
customary
fashion,
so
that
it
didn't
make
that
examination,
but
the
point
is
that
the
record
in
this
case
will
reflect
that
counsel's
statement
was
wrong
with
reference
to
the
67,
approximately,
of
the
ndpa
candidates
who
survived
the
original
agreement
that
they
weren't
qualified,
and
this
was
done
by
letters
of
counsel.
the
court
is
familiar
with
that.
it's
in
the
record
in
this
case.
this
was
done
by
letters
of
counsel,
back
and
forth,
written
at
the
order
of
the
court.
it
certainly
is
true
that
some
ndpa
candidates
filed
declarations
of
intent
prior
to
march
1,
and
that
they
filed
on
the
same
form
that
was
used
by
other
candidates
and
that
that
declaration
of
intent
contained
a
designation
of
committee,
and
designated
themselves,
as
counsel
points
out.
now,
some
did
and
some
did
not
with
reference
to
the
six
people
in
greene
county
who
were
left
off
the
ballot.
my
understanding
is,
and
i
believe
that
these
are
the
facts,
that
all
six
of
those
individuals
had
qualified
as
candidates
in
the
democratic
primary
of
the
regular
democratic
party
of
alabama
which
was
held
on
may
7,
1968.
that,
in
that
primary,
there
were
two
candidates
for
each
of
the
position,
one,
the
ndpa
candidate,
these
six,
the
other,
the
candidate
of
the
regular
democratic
party
of
alabama.
so,
it
was
a
two-man
race,
as
i
understand
it,
in
each
one
of
these.
they
filed
identical
papers.
there's
no
question
about
that,
as
far
as
i
know,
and
they
were
placed
on
the
ballot.
they
were
held
to
be
qualified
to
be
on
the
ballot
in
the
democratic
primary.
now,
each
of
these
six
was
defeated
in
the
democratic
primary
and,
though
i'm
not
trying
the
contempt
case,
i
do
point
out,
as
we
noted
in
brief,
that
this
is
an
unrestricted
primary,
that
everyone
is
allowed
to
vote
in
it.
it's
not
a
close
primary.
counsel
in
his
brief
called
alabama
a
no-party
state
when
it
comes
to
holding
its
primary.
so,
i
don't
make
any
brief
for
the
fact
of
who
would've
won
in
november
had
both
parties
been
on
the
ballot
and
campaigning
against
each
other,
but,
in
may,
that
was
the
result.
now,
counsel
makes
a
point
and
i
think
this
is
a
substantial
question.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
yes,
sir.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
yes,
sir.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
that's
right.
counsel
makes
--
the
solicitor
general
makes
a
very
good
point.
i
think
it
raises
a
substantial
question
because
we
were
not
confronted
with
the
particulars,
as
i've
read
before,
but
let
me
illuminate
it
just
a
little
bit.
they
did
file
those
papers,
identifying
themselves,
and
the
law
allows
it
to
be
done
in
this
fashion,
as
a
candidate
of
or
candidate
seeking
the
nomination
of
the
democratic
party
for
a
particular
position
in
the
primary.
now,
what
they
are
maintaining
is
this,
that
on
the
same
day
that
that
election,
that
primary
election,
was
held,
that
the
national
democratic
party
of
alabama
in
that
county
also
conducted
a
mass
meeting
on
the
same
day
because
this
isn't
that
at
which
political
parties
can
nominate
in
alabama,
that
they
conducted
a
mass
meeting.
and,
i
will
be
frank
to
admit
that
i've
learned,
in
this
case,
i
suppose
that
a
mass
meeting
can
be
two
or
more,
but
that's
not
a
part
of
the
issue
here.
that
issue
was
resolved
unfavorably
to
the
position
of
the
appellees
in
the
district
court
in
the
only
point
on
which
decision
was
made
on,
and
we're
not
raising
it
here.
but,
they
represent
that,
on
that
same
day,
they
were
nominated
by
the
national
democratic
party
of
alabama
for
the
same
offices
in
a
mass
meeting.
and,
what
is
said
now
to
the
court
is
that
the
declarations
of
intent
and
the
designation
of
committee
that
they
made
for
the
handling
of
their
finances
for
this
primary
in
which
they
were
eliminated
and
which,
for
all
that
appears,
they
were
no
longer
a
candidate
because
nobody
knew
of
the
candidacy
of
these
people,
these
candidates
and
most
of
the
other
candidates
of
this
party,
until
about
september
5.
and,
i
think
the
court
will
recall
that
the
record
shows
very
clearly
that
the
certifications
of
nomination
descended
from
huntsville,
alabama
simultaneously
by
registered
or
certified
mail
on
the
various
probate
officers
in
the
67
counties
of
alabama
and
in
the
office
of
the
secretary
of
state
of
the
state
of
alabama.
now,
i
don't
know,
when
i
say
to
the
court
i
think
it
has
not
been
ruled
on
alabama,
whether
a
designation
of
committee
under
the
corrupt
practices
act
made
in
a
situation
in
which
a
party
--
an
individual
does
identify
himself
as
a
participant
in
the
primary
election
process
of
one
party
is
an
adequate
compliance
with
the
corrupt
practices
act.
when
he
turns
up
later
to
be,
and
when
he
loses
that
race,
and
turns
up
later
to
be
the
candidate
of
another
party
that
nominated
on
a
different
fashion,
purportedly
on
the
same
day,
where
his
candidacy
itself
was
not
known
for
a
couple
of
months
later
because
it
was
not
declared,
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that.
i
do
suggest
to
the
court
--
mr.
l.
drew
redden
no,
sir.
the
only
things
that
were
filed
after
would
have
been
reports
of
expenditure.
these
would
have
been
separate
reports.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
only
reports
of
expenditure.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
yes,
sir.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
no,
sir.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
only
in
this
fashion,
the
law
provides
that
those
papers
may
be
submitted
to
the
office
of
a
party
where
the
party
conducts
the
primary.
this
will
constitute
a
satisfaction
of
the
garret
act
and
corrupt
practices
act.
the
only
thing
that
has
happened
here
is
that
there's
not
an
identification
of
this
individual
as
a
candidate
after
may
7,
1968
because
he
lost
the
race.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
each
may
legally
designate
candidates
of
that
political
party.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
i
say
that
that's
what
the
appellants
say.
the
appellants
--
mr.
l.
drew
redden
i
say
that
they
say
and
i
assume
it
happened
because
they
say
that
they
were
nominated
by
a
mass
meeting
on
the
same
day
that
they
lost
in
the
primary
election.
that
is
their
allegation.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
yes,
sir.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
well,
that
would
be
a
separate
thing
that
they
contend.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
no,
what
i'm
saying
is
that
there's
nothing
in
the
alabama
case
that
exists.
certainly,
there's
nothing
in
the
alabama
law
that
would
prevent,
as
i
see,
a
person
from
hedging
his
bet,
if
that
is
uncouth
to
say.
he
can
qualify
as
a
candidate
in
the
democratic
primary.
the
law
says
that
if
another
party,
not
holding
a
primary,
is
a
going
to
nominate
candidates
for
office,
it
must
do
it
by
a
mass
meeting,
which
mass
meeting
must
be
held
on
the
same
day
as
a
primary
election.
now,
he
may
also
be
a
candidate
there.
he
can
lose
in
one
and
win
in
one.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
now,
the
law
does
provide
that
he
can
only
be
on
the
ballot
once
and
only
under
one
emblem,
that
he
couldn't
be
the
candidate
of
both
parties.
that,
actually,
if
you're
going
to
say
that
something
has
been
mooted
as
the
solicitor
general
says,
that
question,
well,
has
been
mooted
in
this
case
because
the
only
persons
who
were
on
the
ballot
twice
lost,
as
far
as
i
know.
i'm
not
aware
of
any
instances
in
which
they
won
both
offices,
as
far
as
that
was
concerned.
but,
what
i'm
saying
merely
is
this.
if
this
court
ruled,
for
example,
that
whatever
was
done
by
six
people
from
greene
county
in
order
to
become
candidates
in
the
democratic
primary
in
the
spring
of
1968
constituted
an
adequate
compliance
with
the
provisions
of
the
garret
act
or
the
corrupt
practices
act.
it
is
not
a
basis
for
holding
the
statutes
invalid
or
unconstitutional.
this
is
a
state
of
alabama's
interest.
we're
not
pushing
the
situation
of
a
particular
candidate.
what
i'm
saying
is,
i
recognize
that
there's
a
substantial
question
raised
here
and
one
that
has
not
been
resolved
by
alabama
law,
that
we
have
persons
who
filled
out
these
forms.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
think
the
record
does
not
support
his
conclusion.
the
record
contains
very
little
in
a
substantial
way,
and
i'll
give
the
court
my
recollection
of
it.
the
most
populous
county
in
alabama
is
jefferson
county
or
birmingham.
it
has
approximately
three-quarters
of
a
million,
population.
the
probate
judge
of
that
county,
judge
j.
paul
meeks,
testified
by
deposition
in
the
case,
and
he
testified
that
there
were
approximately
2,000
compliances
with
the
corrupt
practices
act
filed
in
his
office
alone
in
connection
with
the
spring
elections
and
nominations
in
jefferson
county,
that
will
be
the
compliances
for
local
office,
and
that
everybody
files
them.
that,
it
is
checked
and
that
this
is
a
requirement
before
he
was
certified
a
nominee.
the
only
other
testimony
that
i
think
is,
well,
let
me
withdraw
that
--
mrs.
amos,
the
secretary
of
state,
testified
that
these
are
uniformly
filed
in
her
office.
they
are
required
of
the
candidate
before
he's
certified.
now,
dr.
cashion,
who
was
the
state
chairman
of
the
national
democratic
party
of
alabama,
testified
that
his
party
was
aware
of
the
existence
both
of
the
garret
act
and
the
corrupt
practices
act,
was
aware
of
the
requirements,
and
that
they
caused
to
be
printed
and
the
record
contained
some
copies
of
it.
a
form
bearing
the
legend
from
the
printer,
national
democratic
party
of
alabama
or
ndpa
if
i
forget
whether
the
name
or
the
initials
was
used,
but
it
was
printed
at
the
order
of
the
national
democratic
party
of
alabama
containing
the
form
of
declaration
of
intent
which
satisfied
the
requirements
of
the
garret
act
and
the
designation
of
committee,
and
that
these
were
disseminated
to
the
county
chairman
and
they
were
told
of
the
requirements.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
the
only
--
i
think
we
would
be
disadvantaged
to
say
how
often
this
may
happen
for
the
reason
that
you
would
not
know
of
it
unless
the
action
of
the
certifying
official
either
prompted
litigation
or
publicity,
one
of
the
two
problems.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
yes,
sir.
we
have
three
or
four
reported
cases,
all
of
which
are
cited
in
brief,
and
we
have
a
couple
of
opinions
of
the
attorney
general
of
alabama
which
resulted
from
this
type
of
thing,
and
of
course,
this
has
led
to
the
uniform
holding
in
the
cases
that
the
provisions
of
this
act
are
mandatory
when
raised
in
a
direct
proceeding
prior
to
elections
in
alabama.
the
directory
on
there
and
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
has
said
that,
absent
of
constitutional
question,
that
that
is
a
ruling
that
will
be
binding
on
it
and
found
it
to
be
so
but,
as
i
say,
that
the
record,
to
the
extent
that
it
touches
on
the
question
of
enforcement
or
use,
does
not
support
the
dissenting
opinion's
finding.
it
supports
the
majority
opinion's
finding.
i
think
the
cases
do.
now,
i
don't
think
it's
a
crippling
thing
to
this
position
that
judge
johnson
found,
well,
said
most
of
the
time
that
it
has
been
enforced
it
was
not
done
by
the
state
at
its
own
motion.
well,
i
think
it
normally
is
true
that
the
people
who
really
keep
you
strained
in
political
campaigns
are
going
to
be
the
adversaries.
i
mean,
that
they
certainly
are
going
back
to
the
past.
i
don't
think
it
is
disparaging
to
the
law
--
to
the
enforcement
of
the
law
to
say
that
a
private
party
often
has
brought
the
litigation,
but
the
law
has
been
enforced
and
it
has
been
the
law
for
54
years,
since
1915,
almost
essentially
without
change.
but,
we
make
the
point
again
that,
of
course,
we
have
come
down
now
because
of
the
fact
that
the
election
has
been
held,
we've
come
down
to
the
point
where
--
are
those
who
remain,
the
winners
and
those
who
were
left
off
the
ballot,
we
would
say
that
perhaps
some
did
and
some
did
not
execute
these
doctrines.
as
to
the
greene
county
people,
i
think
that
someone,
whether
it's
this
court
or
the
united
states
district
court
in
further
proceedings,
that
this
court
might
order
has
a
substantial
question
to
decide
whether,
under
this
valid
law,
the
corrupt
practices
act,
that
what
was
done
for
the
purposes
of
entering
into
the
democratic
primary,
would
suffice
as
a
designation
of
a
campaign
committee
to
receive
contributions
for
any
other
race
that
that
candidate
might
have
made
during
that
same
year.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
the
failure
to
comply
with
reference
to
this
portion
of
it
would
be
held
where
the
issue
was
first
raised
after
the
election,
not
to
void
the
election,
as
i
read
the
cases.
of
course,
i
do
make
this
point.
that,
though
we
are
standing
now
subsequent
to
the
election,
we
have
been
disputing
with
this
issue
since
september
of
1968,
prior
to
the
election
and
that
period
is
held
mandatory.
now,
i
think
that
there
are
some
other
provisions
of
the
corrupt
practices
act
that
would
affect
the
ability
to
hold
office
after
the
election,
but
i
don't
make
that
point
here
because
they're
not
involved.
but,
we
keep
returning
to
this
point.
we
are
here
to
uphold
the
validity
of
these
statutes.
we
say
that
the
record
shows
that
they
have
not
been
unconstitutionally
applied
and
they
certainly
are
constitutional
on
their
face.
with
reference
to
the
garret
act,
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to
that
very
briefly.
this
court
is
aware
from
the
record
and
the
briefs
and
our
prior
arguments
that
these
--
piece
of
legislation
was
enacted
subsequent
to
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965,
that
the
effect
of
it
is
to
require
anyone
who
desires
to
be
a
candidate
for
office
to
file
a
declaration
of
intent
by
march
1
of
the
election
year.
i
would
like
to
emphasize
at
this
minute
the
full
picture
with
reference
to
the
right
or
ability
of
people
and
political
parties
to
get
on
the
ballot
in
alabama.
i
think
we've
got
a
situation
that's
exactly
the
reverse
of
williams
against
rhodes.
the
point
is
made
by
the
court
there,
that
it's
impossible
or
very
difficult
for
a
new
party
or
smaller
party
or
a
new
large
party
to
get
on
the
ballot
in
ohio,
that
no
provision
was
made
for
write-in
candidacies
and
that
independent
candidacies
were
almost
unknown
under
the
law
of
ohio.
in
alabama,
an
independent
candidate
for
a
local
position
can
get
on
the
ballot
by
having
a
petition
signed
by
25
names,
by
25
voters
in
a
statewide
election
by
300
votes.
now,
the
court
reviewed
and
william
against
rhodes,
the
laws
of
some
of
the
states
with
reference
to
disease
requires
more
than
1%
or
less
than
1%
is
just
minimal.
it's
a
fraction,
or
if
a
political
party,
that
party
could
nominate
by
primary
or
by
mass
meeting
or
caucus,
as
it's
called.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
yes,
sir.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
announcement.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
announcement
of
the
candidacy.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
that
would
very
likely
be
true
because,
unless
they
did
something
that
would
amount
in
contemplation
of
the
law
to
an
announcement
of
his
candidacy.
i
would
think
that
where
there's
--
lets'
say
that
there's
no
report
of
the
mass
media
that
is
held
private,
it's
not
reported,
and
that
there's
not
activity
which
would
amount
in
substance
to
an
announcement
of
candidacy.
in
other
words,
if
i'm
running
for
sheriff,
i
may
announce
it
by
virtue
of
my
campaign
activity
as
opposed
to
some
formal
announcement.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
yes,
sir.
there
is
that
requirement.
the
law
simply
fixes
the
dead
end
or
far
end
time
within
which
it
must
be
done,
which
is
at
least
60
days
prior
to
the
election.
i
believe
that's
the
law
of
the
general
elections
and
it's
55
days
prior
primary
elections.
the
same
sort
of
thing,
but
that
it
must
be
done
by
that
far
end.
that's
when
the
certification
must
be
made.
that
is
the
last
date.
in
other
words,
what
you
would
say
happen
in
some
of
these
cases
where
nomination
was
by
mass
meeting
occurring
may
7,
1968,
that
nothing
was
said
about
it
until
september
5
when
a
certification
of
nomination
was
sent
either
to
the
probate
office
or
to
the
secretary
of
state's
office,
depending
on
whether
it
was
a
state
or
local
office.
now,
also,
the
law
allows
that
candidates
may
be
nominated
by
conventions
where
the
delegates
to
the
convention
also
were
chose
in
these
caucus
held
on
may
7.
in
other
words,
the
origin
of
nomination
has
to
be
on
may
7
or
the
party
may
hold
a
primary.
now,
of
the
requirements
of
the
law,
the
most
stringent
in
alabama,
far
and
away,
are
the
primary.
a
party
who
--
a
political
party
nominating
by
caucus
of
mass
meeting
has
no
fixed
format
to
follow,
the
law
simply
says
to
be
held
on
that
day,
that
is
the
primary
election
day,
and
to
be
at
or
in
an
immediate
vicinity
of
a
voting
place:
in
a
hall
room
or
open
space,
i
believe
it
says,
and
that's
it.
it
does
say
that
the
report
of
the
nominations
must
be
signed
by
the
chairman,
i
believe,
presiding
at
the
meeting
and
the
secretary
of
the
meeting,
which
was
not
done
in
the
great
many
of
these
cases,
but
no
one
undertook
to
disqualify
anybody
for
failure
to
do
that,
so
that,
the
primary
election
law
is
the
most
stringent.
the
party
holding
the
primary
has
the
most
requirements
to
meet.
now,
it
has
long
been
the
law
in
alabama
that
a
person
seeking
to
run
in
the
primary
election
must
file
his
declaration
of
intent
by
march
1
of
that
election
year.
everything
else
has
been
geared
to
march
1.
a
political
party
eligible
to
hold
a
primary,
but
desiring
not
to
hold
one,
and
to
nominate
back
in
convention
or
caucus
or
mass
meeting
must
make
known
by
approximately
march
1,
and
this
has
long
been
the
law
that
it
decides
not
to
hold
a
primary
election
and
it
can
go
to
other
route
to
request
nomination.
the
sole
effect
of
the
garret
act
was
to
say
to
the
person
who
seeks
nomination
by
the
party
holding
the
caucus
or
mass
meeting
or
who
seeks
to
get
on
the
ballot
as
an
independent
that,
by
march
1,
the
same
date
on
which
the
great
majority
of
other
candidates
who
are
running
in
the
primaries,
the
same
date
on
which
they
must
make
their
declaration
you
must
file
a
declaration
of
intent
to
become
a
candidate.
some
of
these
people
did.
some
of
these
remaining
persons
did,
some
did
not.
again,
the
district
court
did
not
direct
itself
to
a
finding
among
the
123
people
we
started
off
with
as
to
which
ones
did
or
did
not.
it
simply
said
this
is
a
valid
law.
it's
due
to
be
complied
with.
and,
it
held
that
it
was
not
subject
to
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965.
then,
its
application
is
a
matter
for
determination
by
the
proper
authority
whether
--
mr.
l.
drew
redden
yes,
sir.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
no,
sir.
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
no.
well,
to
lose
in
the
primary
if
he
seeks
nomination
by
another
vehicle
and
comes
down
to
the
--
mr.
l.
drew
redden
that's
right.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
right.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
or,
conceivably,
as
an
independent
candidate.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
or,
conceivably,
even
as
an
independent
candidate
had
be
moved
--
mr.
l.
drew
redden
no,
--
mr.
l.
drew
redden
--
it
has
not.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
we
take
the
position
that,
in
the
first
place,
if
the
district
court
examined
this,
it's
finding
is
correct.
i
think
that
--
mr.
l.
drew
redden
yes,
sir.
of
course,
this
court
has,
i
assume,
under
consideration
at
this
time
the
three
mississippi
cases,
and
i'm
not
aware
of
any
decision
that
has
come
out
on
that
yet.
i
think
that
out
of
the
three,
for
example,
if
i
can
extent
just
a
moment
comparing
them
with
our
case,
and
i
may
get
the
name
mixed
up
with
the
facts
but,
in
one
of
these
cases,
as
i
recall,
the
mississippi
law
was
changed
to
make
an
elective
office
an
appointive
office,
office
of
the
superintendent
of
education
in
11
counties
in
mississippi.
this,
i
can
equate
on
the
facts
with
this
case.
and,
another
election
was
changed
from
a
district
election
of
board
of
county
commissioners
or
some
similar
office
to
an
at
large
election.
but,
in
one
case,
and
this
is
the
whitley
against
williams,
you
had
a
statute
which
apparently
did
four
things.
one
of
which
--
only
one
of
which
is
what
the
garret
act
does.
the
statute
fairly
established
to
the
rule
that
no
person
who
had
voted
in
the
primary
election
could
run
as
an
independent
candidate
in
the
general
election.
well,
this,
of
course,
is
not
part
of
alabama
law.
they
require
independent
candidates
to
qualify
to
run
in
the
general
election
as
the
same
time
as
candidates
must
qualify
to
run
in
the
primary
election.
now,
this
is
what
the
garret
act
almost
does,
but
not
quite.
the
garret
act
requires
that
he
declare
his
intent
to
be
a
candidate.
now,
whatever
acts
of
qualification
or
selection
by
petition
may
be
involved,
it
does
not
require
him
to
do
that
at
that
time.
there,
it
most
applied
by
tallying
the
number
of
signatures
of
qualified
electors
and
then
it
had
some
verification
requirements.
i
think
that
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965
is
fifteenth
amendment-oriented
throughout.
i
think
that
just
about
every
section
of
the
act,
with
a
possible
exception
of
section
1973
(c),
makes
specific
reference
to
the
fifteenth
amendment
and
the
protection
of
fifteenth
amendment
rights.
and,
of
course,
that
section
is
applied
only
in
locals
where
it
has
been
found
that
those
rights
have
been
violated
and
that
there
has
been
a
finding
through
the
process
they
had
established
that
there's
going
to
be
--
that
there
will
be
examiners
and
that
the
other
things
will
take
place
provided
for
there.
now,
i
say
in
that
context
that
you
can't
find
or
justify
finding
that
the
garret
act
which
does
only
one
thing,
and
that
is
it
gives
everybody
who
desires
to
be
a
candidate
for
an
office
the
same
starting
time
to
do
only
one
thing
that
is
not
to
become
the
nominee,
but
it
is
to
declare
his
intent
to
become
a
candidate
and
to
freeze
in
place,
in
effect,
then
that
for
at
least
that
election
period.
but,
it
creates
or
systematizes
law
that
has
existed
for
a
long
time,
and
it's
not
a
black
versus
white
proposition.
95%
of
the
people
who
run
for
public
office
have
had
to
comply
with
that
since
about
--
that
time
schedule
since
about
1945.
i
forget
when
the
march
1
requirement
was
put
in.
maybe
it's
a
little
earlier
than
that.
and,
this
merely
systematizes
a
system
its
--
which
itself
is
very
liberal,
which
resulted
in
seven
parties
being
on
the
ballot
in
alabama
this
last
election,
plus,
a
column
for
independence,
plus
a
column
varieties
to
such
an
extent
that
the
complaint
is
made
here
that
the
ballot
is
too
confusing
because
it
is
easy
to
get
on.
and,
we
maintain
that
the
district
court
was
right
in
its
decision
that
the
voting
rights
act
does
not
govern.
of
course,
we
recognize
that
if
this
court
held
to
the
contrary,
it
would
not
be
a
ruling
that
the
act
was
invalid.
it
would
have
the
effect
of
suspending
its
application
for
a
period
of
time
until
its
validity
could
be
determined.
we
understand
that,
but
we
do
press
a
point
that
the
district
court
was
right.
i
don't
know
of
any
other
decisions
than
these
four
plus
the
trust
or
a
trussal
--
the
trussell
case
on
this
point
and
i
--
and
in
related
cases,
and
i
think
that
all
of
them
with
that
one
exception
are
to
the
effect
that
it
did
not
apply.
i'd
like
to
make
only
a
few
other
points
with
reference
to
the
other
statutes.
i
assume
that
counsel
for
the
appellants
will
argue
the
provisions
of
title
17
section
125
of
the
code
of
alabama
which
he
says
that
constitutional
rights
are
being
deprived
of
appellants
because
they
are
not
allowed
to
select
officials
for
the
polling
places.
well,
there
are
six
polling
officials
at
each
polling
place.
this
law
that's
under
attack
provides
that
where
two
or
more
lists
of
suggested
polling
officials
are
submitted
by
political
parties,
that
the
list
submitted
by
the
parties
having
the
highest
receive
--
the
two
parties
receiving
the
highest
number
of
votes
in
the
last
election
will
be
used
to
appoint
the
voting
officials
and
they'll
come
from
those
two
parties.
maybe
this
is
moot
as
to
last
election,
but
i
would
agree
that
if
something
like
this,
if
an
attack
on
a
statute
like
this
could
have
the
effect
of
avoiding
an
election,
then
somebody
should
say
whether
it's
constitutional
or
not,
whether
it's
valid
or
invalid.
counsel
says
we
wouldn't
want
to
be
back
the
next
time
with
reference
to
it,
well,
i
simply
point
out
that
not
everybody.
we
had
seven
parties.
we
have
six
polling
officials
at
a
voting
place.
well,
from
the
beginning,
somebody
had
to
be
eliminated.
somebody
couldn't
have
one.
but,
secondly,
everyone
can
have
a
representative.
the
statutes
which
we
cite
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief
point
out
that
every
candidate,
an
independent,
every
party
is
entitled
to
a
watcher
who
has
right
to
the
access,
the
polls,
to
stand
there
to
observe
the
operation,
and
not
only
that,
to
be
present
when
the
votes
are
counted,
the
right
to
observe
the
count
of
the
votes,
the
right
to
see
the
ballot,
the
right
to
observe
the
tabulation.
and,
we
say
that
this
is
probably
the
weakest
argument,
actually,
that
they
make.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
yes,
sir.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
i
don't
--
i
have
absolutely
no
recollection
of
it
as
an
issue.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
first
one
issue
that
came
up
with
reference
to
some
can
--
mr.
l.
drew
redden
right.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
though
they
undertook
to
decide
no
issues
of
state
law,
actually,
in
this
case.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
i
don't
recall
it
being
raised
by
the
pleadings
at
all.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
there
was
raised
a
parallel
issue
that
was
not
decided,
which
probably
now
is
moot
as
to
some
candidates,
and
that
is
a
fact
that
a
person
would
declare
as
a
candidate
for
one
numbered
position
and
ultimately
be
nominated
or
become
a
candidate
for
another
numbered
position
from
the
same
title
of
office,
for
example,
elector
or
member
of
county
commissioners.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
yes,
sir.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
who
responded.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
i
think
that
you
would
have
to
say
that
the
only
answer
probably
that
the
testimony
gives
to
that
is
a
general
answer.
i
don't
think
that
the
testimony
of
the
secretary
of
state
said
“here
are
cases
in
which
i
have
refused
of
my
own
motion
to
accept.”
i
think
she
said
that
“they
always
are
examined.
we
always
require
compliance
with
this
act.
we
don't
accept
or
certify
people
who
have
not
complied
with
the
act.”
i
don't
think
that
any
examples
were
given
or
any
names
were
called
or
instances
cited
where
that
fact
had
been
the
situation.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
i
think
that
she
also
said
that
she
had,
at
one
time,
indicated
that
they
would
be
accepted.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
that
she
never
did
do
it?
mr.
l.
drew
redden
well,
the
only
thing
that
i
--
mr.
l.
drew
redden
this
ground
of
disqualification
as
an
afterthought?
well,
let
me
just
remind
you
the
timeframe
of
it.
the
disqualification
could
only
come
after
the
certification
was
made,
and
most
of
these
nominations
were
said
to
have
occurred
on
may
7,
1968,
some
on
july
20
where
nomination
was
by
a
convention,
and
none
of
the
certifications
were
made
until
september
10,
1968.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
pardon
me,
i
had
my
date
wrong,
september
5,
1968,
and
this
was
true
whether
the
filing
was
with
the
secretary
of
state
or
with
the
probate
judge.
now,
90%
or
more
of
the
filings
were
with
probate
judges,
who
were
saying
nothing
as
far
as
that
was
concerned.
of
course,
we
made
the
point
in
brief
and
they
talk
about
an
estoppel
that
the
probate
judges
had
not
done
anything
except
receive
by
mail
certificates.
now,
by
september
10,
she
had
acted
and
she
had
declined
to
accept.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
as
to
statewide
offices.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
oh,
yes.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
that's
correct,
but
what
--
in
the
development
of
this
case
and
in
order
to
expedite
his
presentation,
let
me
relate
to
you
how
it
happened.
what
you
are
confronted
with
first
is
a
list
of
perspective
candidates
which,
i
believe,
is
an
approximate
24
at
that
time
in
alabama
of
67
counties
for
local
offices.
then
the
court,
by
order
and
--
required
that
the
parties
communicate
and
that
any
grounds
of
disqualification
of
any
of
those
locals
be
communicated
in
writing,
transmitted
back
and
forth
between
the
parties.
as
result
of
that,
all
of
the
candidates
of
the
seven
counties
were
eliminated.
i
think
we
came
down
to
17
counties
in
which
there
were
counties
for
local
office.
not
all
--
when
i
say
all
of
the
counties,
of
course
they
were
statewide
counties
who
remained
throughout,
but
these
disqualifications
were
based
on
every
statement
of
actual
disqualification.
now,
the
charge
was
made
as
a
blanket
charge
at
that
time
by
the
state
because
it
was
made
before
time
was
even
available
to
check
every
one
them
that
there
was
a
failure
to
comply
the
corrupt
practices
act,
that
there
was
a
failure
to
comply
with
the
garret
act,
and
this
issue
was
raised
in
the
answer.
now,
as
to
other
candidates,
as
to
which
there
was
some
disqualification
that
the
parties
agreed
on,
then
these
were
eliminated.
we
came
down
to
67
candidates
in
17
counties,
i
believe.
maybe
i'm
wrong
a
little
bit.
now,
as
to
that
number,
as
to
that
67,
the
great
majority
did
not
file
the
declaration
of
intent
required
by
the
garret
act
or
the
statement
filed
of
the
requirement.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
with
the
proper
person.
some
of
the
disputed
candidacies
were
still
statewide.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
just
a
few,
yes,
sir.
but,
basically,
it
would
have
been
with
the
probate
judge.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
the
record
does
not
really
develop
anything
on
that,
except
--
mr.
l.
drew
redden
except
the
testimony
of
judge
meeks
that
this
--
that
it's
always
complied
with,
that
this
is
something
that's
done
as
a
matter
of
routine
by
a
candidate
that
he
had
over
$2,000
in
his
office
this
year.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
whether
he
uses
those
words
or
not,
i
think
that
this
would
be
the
fair
intendment
of
his
testimony.
i
frankly
did
not
read
it
recently.
i
don't
think
he
uses
those
words
precisely.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
yes,
i
made
the
argument
here
on
behalf
of
--
mr.
l.
drew
redden
when
i
first
appeared.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
alright,
sir.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
i'd
have
to
confess
that
i
don't
know
how
long
i
have
spoken.
can
you
tell
me,
mr.
hubbard?
mr.
l.
drew
redden
alright.
i
would
say
in
response
to
that,
at
this
time,
that
i
actually
did
not
initiate
any
action.
i
said,
now,
when
i
first
appeared
in
the
case
i
was
counsel
for
mabel
amos,
secretary
of
state.
now,
i
don't
think
that
i
appeared
for
defendants
generally
until
we
operated
on
a
limited
time
schedule
in
the
district
court.
i
think
we
had
a
30-minute
time
for
presentation
and
--
on
that
occasion
for
the
first
time
i
made
the
argument
or
presentation
on
behalf
of
all
defendants
in
that
case,
and
i
did
the
same
thing
in
this
court
where,
on
the
summary
count,
i
think
we
had
30
minutes
to
decide
that
last
occasion.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
that's
correct.
my
office
is
in
birmingham,
alabama.
i'm
not
--
mr.
l.
drew
redden
no.
and,
with
reference
to
what
occurred
after
that,
on
sunday,
i
believe
that
hearing
was
on
friday.
this
court
reached
its
decision
either
friday
or
saturday.
i'm
not
certain
which.
that
--
out
of
which
the
order
came.
on
sunday,
i
had
my
first
knowledge
that
an
order
had
been
writ
--
rendered
by
a
report
in
an
knoxville
newspaper
on
their,
unfortunate
alabama-tennessee
football
game
and
i
saw
the
order
at
that
time.
i
would
have
to
say
--
mr.
l.
drew
redden
i
saw
the
newspaper
at
board,
i'm
sorry.
on
the
sunday
issue
of
the
knoxville
and
i
was
not
quite
clear
really
as
to
what
had
occurred
at
that
time.
i
didn't
see
anything
in
any
birmingham
paper,
i
believe,
until
tuesday
of
that
week.
and
then,
at
some
time
after
tuesday,
would
be
my
recollection,
i
did
receive
--
tuesday
was
a
week
before
election
day.
well,
we
were
here
on
the
18th,
i
believe,
of
october.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
yes,
sir.
so
that
--
mr.
l.
drew
redden
and,
this
art
is
dated
the
19th
of
october.
i
didn't
know
whether
it
was
the
19th
or
the
18th.
and,
i
would
gather,
probably
wednesday
of
that
week,
i
got
a
copy
of
this
which
i
assumed
that
was
received
also
in
the
attorney
general's
office
in
montgomery.
i
didn't
do
anything.
mr.
bolt
called
me
on
friday
or
saturday
of
that
week
and
asked
me
if
i
knew
of
the
order
and
i
told
him
that
i
had
received
this
and
whatever
are
the
knowledge
i
had
of
it.
and,
he
asked
me
whether
the
people
who
would
be
involved
knew
of
it,
and
i
told
him
that
i
had
not
done
anything.
he
told
me
that
--
well,
he
asked
me
if
i
would
object
to
a
letter
being
written
from
his
office
to
the
probate
judge's
or,
i
guess,
to
all,
maybe
to
ms.
amos
too.
i
told
him
i
didn't
have
any
objection,
but
i
didn't
know
what
the
position
the
attorney
general
of
alabama
would
take
about
a
matter
like
that
because
of
the
fact
that
i
was
not
an
attorney
general
and
that
i
didn't
know
what
knowledge
the
various
people
had
of
it.
my
recollection
is
that
this
would've
been
on
a
friday
afternoon
or
saturday
morning,
one
of
the
two,
because
i
know
i
had
the
feeling
that
the
attorney
general's
office
probably
was
not
open
or
available
to
me
at
the
time
being
at
all.
then,
on
monday,
i
call
for
mr.
bookawt
in
montgomery
to
ascertain
whether
it
was
felt
that
everybody
knew
of
it
and
what
action
had
been
taken,
and
i
didn't
know
--
mr.
l.
drew
redden
the
deputy
attorney
general
of
montgomery.
i
didn't
know,
of
course,
whether
orders
--
the
captures
of
the
order
have
been
disseminated
to
various
people.
i
knew
that
there
had
been
or
--
i'm
not
sure
i
was
unaware
that
they
had
been
in
the
district
court.
i
am
now
aware
that
the
district
court
orders
were
disseminated,
and
i
was
unable
to
get
him
--
mr.
l.
drew
redden
that
would
be
right.
then,
i
was
unable
to
get
him
on
that
day.
i
did
talk
to
another
attorney
in
the
office
who
was
not
involved
in
this
case
and
had
no
knowledge
of
it,
except
that
he
said
that
he
would
have
mr.
bookawt
to
get
in
touch
with
me.
and,
my
recollection
is
that
he
and
i
talked
either
once
or
twice.
i
know
we
talked
once
and,
also,
that
he
either
told
me
or
his
office
reported
to
mine
that
he
had
checked
with
the
secretary
of
state's
office.
that
the
only
certification
that
we
had
ever
made
or
the
only
communication
--
mr.
l.
drew
redden
may
it
please
the
court.
i
was
making
a
response
to
a
question
mr.
justice
fortas
asked
and
had
almost
pleaded.
i'll
continue
with
that,
if
i
may.
mr.
l.
drew
redden
i
talked
to
mr.
bookawt,
the
deputy
attorney
general
who,
i
believe,
on
two
occasions
and
he
did
some
checking
apparently
with
the
--
come
to
know
with
the
office
of
the
secretary
of
state,
and
the
message
came
back
that
--
either
to
this
effect
that
all
knew
or
all
had
been
advised
but
i've
come
to
learn
that
the
basis
of
this
probably
was
that
the
secretary
of
state
advised
that
the
only
message
that
she
had
sent
to
the
various
probate
judges,
which
would
be
all
67
probate
judges
not
just
a
few
involved
with
local
offices,
was
the
message
that
pursuant
to
the
decree
of
the
district
court
the
following
persons
would
be
certified,
and
that
she
had
not
ever
rescinded
that
messages
though
there
was
a
period
of
time
within
which
it
--
a
brief
period
of
time,
within
which
it
could've
been
rescinded
and
i
believe
she
testified,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
she
was
working
on
a
rescission
message
at
the
time
she
learned
of
the
order
here,
which
i
believe
she
says
she
recalls
learning
in
all
probability
from
the
attorney
general's
office.
so
that,
what
had
been
sent
to
them,
the
only
message
that
had
been
sent
to
them
from
the
office
of
the
secretary
of
state
was
a
message
that,
pursuant
to
the
order
of
the
district
court,
that
the
following
names
would
be
certified.
of
course,
they
had
received
a
similar
or
--
well,
i
say,
they
were
--
had
received
a
copy
of
the
order
of
the
district
court
which
named
all
of
the
person.
i
assume
that
the
message
from
the
secretary
of
state
did
not
name
any
about
the
statewide
candidates.
the
only
other
pieced
of
information
i
have
with
reference
to
notification
of
us,
and
i
didn't
know
this
at
the
time,
but
mr.
bookawt
testified
when
his
deposition
was
taken
that
he
learned
of
the
fact
that
the
order
had
been
entered
by
this
court
on
saturday
afternoon,
october
19,
which
would
have
been
the
date
that
it
was
entered.
he
was
called
at
his
home
by
the
clerk
or
a
deputy
clerk
in
montgomery
and
was
given
that
message
directly
and
was
asked
to
write
it
down
which,
i
believe,
he
testified
he
did.
this
order
was
entered
approximately
either
16
or
15
days
prior
to
the
date
of
the
election,
depending
on
how
you
would
count
it.
under
the
arrangement,
there
is
a
division
of
time
with
judge
herndon's
counsel.
i
would
like
to
make
just
a
couple
of
other
points,
if
i
may.
one
is
this,
the
solicitor
general
said
that
he
consider
that,
on
the
merits,
there
has
been
a
serious
abridgment
of
the
right
to
participate
in
a
political
process
and
he
relates
three
areas
in
which
he
says
this
abridgment
result.
one
is
the
right
of
association,
the
other,
right
of
candidates
to
run
for
office
and,
the
third,
the
right
for
citizens
to
vote
for
the
candidates
of
their
choice.
maybe
i
had
reiterated
too
often,
but
our
position,
again,
from
the
position
of
the
state
of
alabama,
we
are
not
concerned
with
individual
positions
or
individual
candidates.
we
are
concerned
with
a
validity
of
the
statutes
under
attack
and
also,
of
course,
with
maintaining
that,
as
to
the
facts
of
this
case,
that
they
were
not
unconstitutionally
applied.
now,
those
two
determinations
were
made
by
the
district
court,
and
we
say
that
they
are
due
on
this
record
and
on
the
facts
to
be
upheld.
we
maintain
that
this
case
can't
be
viewed
solely
on
the
basis
of
whatever
history
of
discrimination
there
might
have
been
in
alabama
or
in
any
other
state
in
the
past.
we
acknowledge
that,
through
decisions
of
this
court,
decisions
in
other
places,
the
state
has
stood
convicted
of
particular
acts
that
the
court
has
found
to
be
discriminatory
on
other
occasions.
we
don't
maintain
to
this
court
that
that's
not
true,
but
we
do
maintain
that
to
give
those
an
overwhelming
importance
here
when
we
have
to
view
legislation
in
the
context
of
when
it
came
into
being,
what
its
purposes
are
and,
finally,
how
little
burden
it
imposes.
and,
i
think
that's
one
thing
that,
of
course,
appellants
deemphasize
and
they
tend
to
argue
that
this
creates
a
tremendous
burden
on
one
seeking
to
run
for
public
office.
we
think
that
the
statutes,
the
ballot
itself,
in
alabama,
demonstrate
how
easy
it
is
to
be
a
candidate.
the
district
court,
again,
and
this
point
has
been
brought
up
earlier
today,
made
the
findings
i
have
resided
in
favor
of
appellees
and
then
it
said
that
it
would
not
determine
the
issues
of
state
law
that
were
involved,
having
made
those
findings.
of
course,
as
this
court
has
pointed
out
today
during
this
argument,
it
had
the
authority
to.
it
was
not
a
matter
of
its
saying
that
we
have
no
authority
to
decide
this.
it
determined
that
it
would
not.
now,
we
say
to
this
court
that
that
order
or
judgment
is
due
to
be
upheld.
the
judgment
appealed
from
is
due
to
be
affirmed.
at
the
same
time,
it
would
not
be
improper
in
our
judgment
that
that
court,
that
is
the
district
court,
make
those
determinations
of
state
law
or
that
it
be
directed
through
a
remand
from
this
court
to
make
those
determinations.
but,
as
a
preliminary
event,
there
has
to
be
a
determination
on
the
validity
of
the
statutes
and
on
their
application
in
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
this
case.
state
of
alabama
is
not
here
arguing
to
set
aside
the
election
of
any
particular
individual
who
was
elected
or
to
say
that
if
there
was
someone
kept
off
the
ballot
in
greene
county
who
was
due
to
be
put
on,
that
there
shouldn't
be
a
new
election.
this
is
not
our
position.
our
positions
is,
the
statutes
are
valid,
that
the
record
doesn't
support
any
conclusion
but
that
they
were
validly
enforced
and
applied
in
this
case.
and
then,
there
is
a
matter
of
detail
as
to
the
question
of
whether
a
particular
person
satisfied
the
statute,
whether
a
particular
person's
election
is
due
to
be
upheld.
to
this
point
then,
we
finally
agree
with
the
solicitor
general
that
it
has
become
moot
as
to
everybody
but
these
people.
but,
the
important
question
still
has
to
be
resolved
and
would
have
to
be
resolved
as
long
as
one
of
them
remained,
and
that's
the
validity
of
the
statute.
that's
what
we're
interested
in,
and
we
think
that
the
mechanics
of
the
thing
might
well
be
after
that.
that
this
court
would
direct
if
the
district
court
ascertained
what
should
be
the
result
in
the
application
of
these
valid
statutes
to
the
particular
persons
whose
fate
yet
remains
unsettled.
i
reserve
the
remaining
time.
mr.
hubbard,
thank
you.
