which?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

i
must
say
mr.
hanson,
i'm
puzzled.
i
don't
know
what
your
distinction
is.
you
said
that
any
test
related
to
a
jurors
or
juror
was
a
dangerous
test
but
and
that
you
favors
that
formulation
did
not
contribute
to
the
verdict,
well,
what's
the
difference?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

well,
you
call
mr.
justice
harlan
dissented

i'm
interested
in
your
view.

yes,
but
how
do
you
test,
what
i'm
trying

how
do
you
test
whether

not
beyond
the

doubt
a
judge
may
say
that
the
error
did
not
contribute
to
the
verdict?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
assuming,
mr.
hanson,
that
we
are
going
to
apply
the
harmless
error
rule.
what
i'm
trying
to
get
some
help
from
you
is
to
precisely
how
you
test
whether
or
not
if
the

did
