justice
abe
fortas
well,
excuse
me
if
we
should
decide
that
harmless
error
doctrine
is
applicable
here
in
this
bruton
type
of
situation,
do
you
think
we
ought
to
decide
whether
this
record
shows
that
the
error
is
harmless
or
send
it
back?
justice
abe
fortas
you
mean
--
but
that
means
virtually
inconceivable
to
the
court,
is
there
a
difference
between
the
court
saying
it's
virtually
inconceivable
to
us
on
the
one
hand
and
on
the
other
hand
that
is
virtually
inconceivable
that
a
jury
could've
found
it
virtually
or
a
juror
could've
found
it
virtually
inconceivable?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that's
still
--
still
a
difference
between
saying
a
jury
or
in
the
juror
because
if
you
had
just
one
juror
who
felt
that
harrington
was
not
the
man
and
that
would've
prevent
him
returning
a
guilt
of
verdict,
wouldn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i'm
not
sure
that's
the
right
test
but
if
that
were
the
test
but
what
i'm
asking,
what
i'm
suggesting
to
you
is
there
is
a
difference
between
a
court
saying
that
it
doesn't
believe
that
a
jury
could've
escape
the
conclusion
and
the
court
facing
up
to
very
difficult
problem
which
is
whether
a
single
rational
jury,
juror
where
a
single
rational
juror
might
have
arrived
at
the
conclusion
that
he
could
not
find
harrington
guilty
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt
absent
these
statements
of
the
--
in
the
confessions.
justice
abe
fortas
you
would
say
that
we
ought
to
look
at
it
from
point
of
view
of
the
jury
as
a
whole?
justice
abe
fortas
but
it
is
different,
do
you
agree
that
that
is
different
from
looking
at
it
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
court
himself?
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that
these
are
subtle
psychological
inquiries
that
psychological
differences
are
the
greatest
certainty
in
perhaps
useless
man.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
suppose
if
there
is
a
question
counsel
is
to
whether
the
standard
of
harmless
error
adopted
by
the
state
court
should
be
considered
in
the
terms
of
state
law
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
that's
what
you're
talking
about
here
is
the
impact
of
the
deprival
of
a
federal
constitutional
right
when
you're
talking
about
the
application
of
a
standard
that
this
court
fixed
in
interpretation
and
applications
standard
of
this
court
laid
down
in
chapman
case?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
hanson,
wouldn't
you
agree
that
a
great
deal
of
difference
between
these
two
considerations
on
the
one
hand
what
is
the
--
what
--
does
the
court
conceive
of
as
the
impact
of
this
particular
error
namely
the
admission
of
the
confessions
of
a
codefendants?
that's
number
one.
number
two,
what
does
the
court
believe
that
considering
the
record,
the
rest
of
the
record
without
reference
to
the
confessions
of
the
codefendants?
was
there
a
--
is
there
beyond
reasonable
doubt
in
the
court's
mind
whether
from
its
point
of
view
or
its
assumption
of
the
jury's
point
of
view
convincing
evidence
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt
that
this
man
was
guilty.
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
asking
you
whether
you
would
--
whether
you
agree
that
those
two
things
are
different
that
is
to
say
one,
did
the
admission
of
the
confessions
of
the
codefendants
contribute
to
the
result
or
two,
eliminating
the
confessions
of
the
codefendants
does
they
remain
in
the
record
evidence
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt
of
a
--
to
shorten
up
that
this
--
that
the
defendant
was
guilty?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that's
the
first
one.
you
heard
the
banks
argument
that's
the
first
alternative
i
put.
you
heard
the
banks
argument
here
in
preceding
case?
justice
abe
fortas
and
there
what
we're
talking
about
a
standard
that
used
by
the
california
court
to
the
effect
that
looking
at
the
evidence
as
a
whole
and
discounting
the
comment,
the
improper
comment
the
court
felt
that
that
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt,
this
fellow
is
guilty.
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
and
goes
to
an
evaluation
of
the
total
record
absent
the
unconstitutional
aspect
of
it
and
i
was
suggesting
that
perhaps
there's
a
difference
between
that
and
an
evaluation
of
whether
the
error
contributed
to
the
verdict.
justice
abe
fortas

excuse
me
if
we
should
