mr.
james
h.
kline
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
respondent
and
the
amici
joined
the
respondent
are
verily
concerned
of
the
impact
of
bruton
versus
united
states
and
roberts
versus
russell.
we
feel
that
these
two
cases
will
have
a
profound
effect
on
the
administration
of
justice
throughout
the
various
states.
now,
petitioner
harrington
would
expand
the
impact
of
these
two
cases
by,
one,
making
a
bruton
error
per
se
reversible
without
applying
any
type
of
harmless
error
standard
and
two,
by
making
bruton
fully
retroactive.
at
this
point,
i
would
like
to
tell
this
court
the
experience
of
california
as
the
joint
trials.
we
have
a
penal
code
statute
which
authorizes
joint
trials
and
we
have
obtained
statistics
from
the
los
angeles
district
attorney's
office
with
regard
to
joint
trials.
for
the
years
1967
and
1968,
statistics
for
these
two
years,
from
this
particular
county
reflect
that
approximately
20%
of
the
trials
involved
two
or
more
defendants.
now,
if
this
percentage
prevails
throughout
the
state.
this
represents
a
sizeable
number
of
cases
in
california.
for
instance
in
1967,
there
was
a
total
of
13,500
contested
criminal
matters
tried
in
the
superior
of
court
of
california.
in
1968,
there
was
a
total
of
16,140
contested
criminal
matters
tried
in
the
superior
courts
throughout
the
state.
as
you
can
tell
the
figures
are
progressingly
getting
higher
and
if
you
go
back
10
years,
you
go
back
20
years,
you
go
back
30
years.
the
adequate
number
of
cases
affected
by
bruton
is
truly
staggering.
now,
let's
turn
our
attention
to
mr.
hanson's
first
contention
that
the
chapman
harmless
error
rule
is
not
applicable
to
a
bruton
type
situation.
as
i
have
indicated
in
my
brief,
the
vast
number
of
cases
subsequent
to
bruton
which
had
discussed
this
issue
have
held
that
bruton
is
not
automatically
reversible.
i
submit
that
logic
and
some
policy
support
this
rule.
it
is
obvious
that
there
are
material
variances
in
codefendant's
statements
with
regard
as
to
their
incubating
effect
as
well
as
to
whether
the
fact
they
added
critical
weight
to
the
prosecution's
case.
now,
if
an
automatic
reversal
rule
is
adopted
by
this
court,
then
a
bruton
situation
would
be
reversed
regardless
if
the
particular
error
conceivably
played
any
part
in
the
verdict
either
on
direct
appeal
or
on
collateral
attack.
indirectly,
you
--
this
court
has
indicated
in
gilbert
versus
california
that
a
harmless
error
rule
is
applicable
to
a
bruton
type
situation.
there,
if
you
recall
the
petitioner
had
a
confession
used
against
the
man
which
he
was
mentioned
approximately
159
times.
the
petition
--
the
petitioner
there
requested
that
this
court
overrule
delli
paoli
at
that
time.
and
this
court
declined
to
do
so
noting
that
the
california
supreme
court
had
adopted
in
random
we
have
--
which
had
rejected
delli
paoli.
this
court
also
noted
that
the
california
supreme
court
had
held
the
particular
bruton
error
harmless
in
griffin
and
in
this
court
noted
that
the
harmless
error
standard
applied
by
the
california
supreme
court
was
substantially
and
compliance
with
fahey
and
chapman.
therefore,
this
court
declined
to
rule
on
overrule
a
delli
paoli
at
that
time.
now,
i
would
submit
that
the
fair
import
of
these
remarks
is
that
bruton
is
subject
to
a
chapman's
harmless
errors
standard.
it
should
be
noted
that
the
bruton
case
was
an
extreme
case
factually.
the
codefendant's
statement
was
not
admissible.
i
guess
the
codefendant
evans
as
a
result
since
it
was
inadmissible
against
evans
there
is
nothing
on
the
other
hand
in
which
to
alleviate
any
possible
prejudice
against
bruton.
also,
the
identification
evidence
was
much
weaker
against
bruton
than
against
evans.
and
as
a
result
on
retrial,
evans
was
acquitted
and
so
therefore
the
solicitor
general
indicated
because
of
these
facts
that
case
should
be
reversed.
now,
we
contend
that
the
evidence
in
the
instant
case
is
much
stronger
than
was
the
situation
in
bruton.
before
i
apply
the
chapman
harmless
error
standard
to
the
instant
case,
i
would
like
to
delineate
six
factors
which
i
think
is
pertinent
to
any
inquiry
in
applying
chapman
to
a
bruton
type
situation.
the
first
situation
--
the
first
factor
to
consider
of
course
is
the
quality
of
the
limiting
instruction
given
by
the
trial
judge.
if
a
particularly
lucid
and
precise
instruction
is
probably
given
to
the
jury
before
the
statement
is
introduced
in
the
evidence,
i
would
think
this
would
help
alleviate
some
of
the
prejudice
of
an
incriminating
statement.
and
i
note
with
interest
frazier
versus
cupp
which
was
rendered
by
this
court
yesterday
and
which
in
the
context
of
an
opening
statement
this
court
indicated
that
a
limiting
instruction
can
be
affected
to
that
extent.
the
second
factor
to
consider
of
course
is
the
nature
of
the
codefendant's
statement.
there,
the
defendant
assumed
his
fair
share
of
guilt.
this
court
noted
in
bruton
that
it
is
common
with
codefendants
to
shift
the
blame
but
if
the
defendant
assumes
his
fair
share
of
the
guilt
that
is
something
to
consider
also.
the
third
factor
to
consider
also
is
the
amount
of
detail
concerning
actions
of
other
parties.
in
other
words,
if
the
details
in
the
incriminating
confessions
is
quite
skimpy
in
comparison
with
the
other
prosecution
evidence,
i
would
think
this
would
be
a
pertinent
inquiring
applying
chapman.
the
fourth
factors
take
in
consideration
is
the
weight
of
the
other
evidence.
now,
if
the
weight
of
the
other
evidence
is
quite
strong
then
it
would
be
my
contention
that
it
would
--
the
jury
would
be
more
unlikely
to
disobey
a
court's
limiting
instruction.
and
the
fifth
factor
to
consider
of
course
is
the
nature
of
the
defense.
did
the
defendant
offer
any
testimony
in
support
of
his
defense
or
did
he
just
put
the
prosecution
to
its
proof.
mr.
james
h.
kline
i'm
sorry.
i
didn't
here
that
your
honor.
mr.
james
h.
kline
yes.
mr.
james
h.
kline
yes
your
honor.
i
think
that
is
a
pertinent
factor
to
consider
in
applying
chapman.
mr.
james
h.
kline
yes.
there
are
three
codefendants
your
honor
who
did,
whose
statement
were
introduced
in
evidence
but
has
been
admitted
by
counsel
rose
confession
it
is
not
subject
to
a
bruton
type
error
because
he
was
--
mr.
james
h.
kline
because
he
was
--
he
did
testify
on
the
stand.
he
was
available
for
cross-examination
and
all
the
parties
did
in
fact
cross-examined
him
and
in
that
regard
i'd
like
to
emphasize
the
fact
that
rhone
did
admit
making
his
statement
enhance
the
situation
with
erroneous
vastly
different
from
douglas
versus
alabama
where
are
the
guys
of
refreshing
a
witnesses
recollection
the
prosecutor
asked
the
witness
to
either
deny
or
affirm
certain
statements
that
he
made
in
his
confession.
this
court
indicated
that
since
the
witness
declined
to
answering
this
question
that
the
other
codefendant
was
denied
his
right
of
confrontation
because
he
had
not
admitted
making
such
a
statement.
now,
that
situation
is
different
from
this
situation
because
rhone
did
admit
to
make
such
a
statement.
mr.
james
h.
kline
that's
correct.
in
that
regard,
like
the
--
mr.
james
h.
kline
yes,
that's
true
your
honor
but
before
i
turn
my
attention
to
the
other
two
confessions,
i
would
like
to
emphasize
the
fact
that
rhone
is
the
only
person
that
does
name
petitioner
harrington
and
he's
the
only
one
that
details
the
activities
of
rhone
both
before
the
robbery
and
after
the
robbery.
rhone
was
quite
explicit
in
telling
where
harrington
was
while
in
the
store
at
the
different
events
that
occurred
in
the
store.
he
also
indicated
that
--
mr.
james
h.
kline
no,
they
did
not.
the
only
reference
is
to
a
white
man
and
in
that
regard
i
would
like
to
turn
my
attention
to
bosby
statement.
mr.
james
h.
kline
your
honor,
i'm
very
happy
you
asked
the
question
because
i
think
the
lower
court
has
used
a
standard
which
is
the
equivalent
of
chapman
and
may
i
refer
your
honor
to
page
437
of
the
single
appendix
in
which
the
--
is
part
of
the
opinion
of
a
lower
state
court.
now,
the
lower
state
court
summarized
the
admissible
evidence
besides
the
three
codefendants'
confessions
and
they
said
that
in
summarize
in
the
admissible
constitutional
evidence
"it
is
virtually
inconceivable
that
any
jury
could
have
escaped
the
conclusion
that
harrington
was
engaged
in
attempted
robbery
and
was
answerable
for
the
murder
committed
by
his
coconspirator
in
the
course
thereof."
now,
it's
our
contention
that
it
is
virtually
inconceivable
is
the
equivalent
of
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
mr.
james
h.
kline
your
honor
i
think
the
precise
language
of
the
court
is
that
it
is
virtually
inconceivable
that
any
jury
could
have
escaped
to
conclusion.
so,
i
think
the
court
itself
has
answered
your
honor's
question.
mr.
james
h.
kline
your
honor,
i
would
disagree
with
the
test
as
you
proposed
it.
mr.
james
h.
kline
i
would
agree
would
appear
--
goes
two
different
matters
but
i
would
disagree
with
the
applicability
of
that
particular
statute.
mr.
james
h.
kline
yes,
the
jury
as
a
whole
because
after
all
the
juries
--
mr.
james
h.
kline
well,
i
think
the
court
can
look
at
the
case
as
a
whole,
evidence
as
a
whole
and
determine
if
any
particular
error
in
the
context
of
the
evidence
as
a
whole
is
prejudicial
whether
a
jury
could've
conceivably
risk
any
different
verdict
but
for
the
fact
there
was
not
admitted.
mr.
james
h.
kline
yes
i
would
think
so,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
james
h.
kline
well,
--
mr.
james
h.
kline
yes,
i
would
agree
of
that
position.
yes
your
honor.
mr.
james
h.
kline
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
h.
kline
yes,
your
honor.
it
is
true
the
standard
utilized
by
the
lower
court
that
the
state
harmless
error
standard
but
it
is
my
contention
in
view
of
the
language
of
the
lower
court
that
the
harmless
error
standard
utilized
as
such
is
the
equivalent
of
chapman.
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
in
gilbert
versus
california,
a
comparable
situation
was
thereto.
there,
the
california
supreme
court
had
utilized
the
state
harmless
error
standard
in
reference
to
griffin
error
and
the
--
this
court
indicated
that
that
standard
was
substantially
equivalent
of
fahey
and
chapman
as
a
result
indicated
that
it
may
not
overruled
delli
paoli.
so,
i
would
indicate
that
the
same
reasoning
it
can
be
applied
here
since
it
is
the
--
it
is
virtually
inconceivable
as
what
i
would
equate
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
now,
let's
turn
our
attention
to
bosby's
statement.
in
regard
to
bosby's
statement
counsel
for
petitioner
harrington
made
an
interesting
comment.
this
is
contained
at
page
237
of
the
single
appendix.
and
his
state
as
follows
in
reference
to
bosby's
statement
"largely
here
in
the
bosby
statement
we
have
a
statement
which
is
not
in
essence
terribly
incriminating
against
harrington
as
it
was
originally
given.
he
didn't
even
know
harrington's
name."
and
that's
true,
he
didn't
even
know
harrington's
first
name.
he
further
described
harrington
as
a
blonde
headed
fellow
and
this
is
contained
at
page
286
of
the
single
appendix.
all
the
prosecution
witnesses
in
the
instant
case
indicated
that
the
defendant
was
red-haired
man
that
he
had
a
bright
red
shinny
hair
and
yet
bosby
describes
him
as
a
blonde
headed
fellow
and
if
the
jury
literally
followed
that
description
they
would
think
that
some
other
defendant
besides
harrington
was
involved.
furthermore,
in
comparison
with
rhone's
confession
as
compared
to
bosby's
confession
the
details
of
the
white
man
is
extremely
limited
for
instance,
bosby
indicated
that
he
presumed
that
the
white
man
entered
the
store
with
charles.
bosby
did
not
know
where
the
white
man
was
at
the
time
of
the
gunshot.
furthermore,
bosby
never
saw
him
with
a
gun.
so,
when
you
compare
harrington's
statement
which
is
not
--
i
mean
when
you
compare
rhone's
statement
which
does
not
fall
within
the
bruton
ambit,
bosby's
statement
is
extremely
limited
with
reference
to
the
incriminating
details
as
to
the
white
man's
role
in
the
robbery.
now,
let's
turn
our
attention
to
the
two
statements
of
cooper.
cooper
actually
made
two
statements.
the
first
statement
of
course
is
an
exculpatory
statement.
there,
he
denied
any
involvement
in
the
crime
whatsoever.
he
merely
indicate
that
he
entered
the
store,
approached
this
cashier's
register,
attempted
to
cash
a
check,
and
noticed
that
there's
a
scuffle
subsequent
gun
shot,
he
became
frightened
he
then
ran
out
the
store,
got
in
his
car
and
three
other
people
got
in
his
car.
interesting
enough,
he
mentions
the
fact
that
there
were
other
caucasians
around
the
store
before
he
entered
the
store.
while
he
is
attempting
the
cash
to
check
at
the
cash
register,
he
indicates
that
there
was
a
white
guy
behind
him.
now,
we
don't
know
that
this
white
guy
that
was
behind
and
refers
to
petitioner
harrington
to
some
other
caucasian
who
--
that
cooper
had
made
reference
to
before.
he
also
indicated
that
there
is
a
white
boy
in
cooper's
car
at
the
time
cooper
got
in
the
car.
at
no
time
did
cooper
get
in
to
--
at
no
time
did
cooper
see
the
white
boy
with
a
gun
which
is
again
a
variance
with
the
prosecution
testimony.
details
of
the
white
man's
role
in
the
robbery
is
even
more
skimpy
than
bosby's
confession.
now,
cooper
second
statement
that
is
the
cooper's
confession
is
only
three
pages
long.
it
has
a
few
more
details
of
what
the
white
man
did.
now,
the
four
of
them
did
go
to
the
store,
four
of
them
did
go
into
the
store,
the
white
man
followed
cooper
into
the
store
and
that
is
the
only
reference
that
we
have
with
reference
to
the
white
man
as
to
cooper's
confession.
again,
we
don't
know
what
transpired
in
the
store,
we
don't
know
whether
harrington
had
a
gun,
we
don't
know
whether
harrington
tried
to
get
in
the
cash
register
or
not,
in
short,
the
references
to
cooper
and
bosby's
statement
are
very
limited
in
describing
the
activities
of
the
white
man
involved
in
the
store.
the
white
man's
role
implying
the
robbery,
we
don't
know
about
and
comparison
with
rhone's
confession.
rhone
is
quite
explicit
on
all
these
things
and
i
would
contend
that
cooper's
and
bosby's
statement
are
merely
cumulative
of
detail
which
was
admissible
in
rhone's
confession.
in
addition,
the
other
address
presented
by
the
prosecution
was
exceedingly
strong
for
this
was
no
circumstantial
evidence
as
was
the
situation
in
chapman.
we
have
not
two
witnesses.
we
have
three
witnesses
who
positively
identified
petitioner
harrington.
we
have
mrs.
robins,
the
proprietor
of
the
store,
her
brother
mr.
ashbreath
(ph)
as
well
as
a
customer
by
the
name
of
mrs.
williams.
now,
two
of
these
witnesses
described
harrington
as
a
red-haired
chap.
it
should
be
noted
at
the
time
of
trial
harrington
did
not
have
red
hair.
he
had
black
hair
because
harrington
had
dyed
his
hair
black
after
the
robbery.
and
i
would
claim
that
this
is
significant
in
strengthening
their
identification
since
they
recognized
the
fact
that
this
was
the
red
haired
chap
that
they
had
seen
going
into
the
store.
furthermore,
we
have
harrington's
very
incriminating
statements
he
made
to
the
police.
harrington
admitted
the
fact
that
he
was
the
red
hair
chap
that
had
entered
the
store
with
three
negro
companions
that
after
the
murder
he
run
to
the
car
with
three
other
negroes
that
subsequent
thereto
he
dyed
his
hair
red,
he
shaved
off
his
red
mustache
and
i
must
agree
with
the
lower
court
it
is
virtually
inconceivable
that
any
jury
would
have
concluded
come
to
any
other
conclusion
that
it
did
even
absent
the
error
of
admitting
bosby
and
cooper's
statements.
furthermore,
i
would
think
that
the
--
as
i've
indicated
earlier
i
think
the
lower
court
has
resolved
the
harmless
error
using
a
chapman
test
and
i
would
analogize
to
the
situation
in
gilbert
versus
california
which
this
court
indicated
that
when
a
california
supreme
court
utilized
a
standard
comparable
to
chapman
that
was
permissible
and
i
would
think
the
lower
court
did
since
the
lower
did
the
same
thing
in
the
instant
case
that
should
--
that
rational
should
be
applicable
here
also.
next,
i
would
like
to
discuss
retroactivity.
i
approached
this
subject
with
the
little
bit
of
concern.
it
is
my
purpose
in
discussing
retroactivity
with
the
hope
that
you
would
reconsider
roberts
versus
russell.
now,
this
court
has
indicated
there
are
three
criteria
in
determining
whether
rule
should
be
prospectively
applied
or
retroactively
applied.
they
are
the
purpose
of
the
rule,
the
reliance
on
the
old
rule,
the
effect
on
the
administration
of
justice.
now,
the
purpose
of
bruton
obviously
is
to
insure
the
reliability
of
the
fact
find
process
but
that
purpose
may
not
necessitate
the
fact
that
the
rule
has
to
be
applied
retroactively.
for
instance,
in
johnson
versus
new
jersey,
this
court
indicated
it's
a
question
of
probability.
she
have
to
look
to
see
if
there's
other
safeguards
and
by
comparison
i
would
compare
the
situation
in
stovall
versus
denno
which
this
court
limited
the
retroactivity
as
the
line
of
cases.
now,
surely
there
can
be
no
greater
effecting
of
the
reliability
of
fact-finding
process
than
to
have
this
suggested
lineup
and
a
mistaken
identification.
certainly
that
leads
to
miscarriage
of
justice.
yet,
this
court
indicated
that
in
that
situation
you
decided
to
limit
retroactivity.
now,
i
would
quarrel
with
this
court
with
the
fact
that
bruton
does
not
affect
the
integrity
of
the
factfinding
process.
to
me,
it
does
not
and
i
would
rely
on
the
language
of
judge
learned
hand
who
stated
that
while
bruton,
delli
paoli
procedure
rest
on
a
fiction
it
still
helps
the
jury
in
ascertaining
the
truth
and
i
would
like
to
emphasize
the
fact
that
statement
of
codefendant's
traditionally
have
been
viewed
with
suspicion
and
distrust.
a
statement
of
a
person
himself
has
a
lot
more
impact
on
a
jury
that
a
statement
of
a
codefendant
who's
blaming
somebody
else
and
i
would
submit
that
a
limiting
instruction
in
the
proper
case
in
view
of
the
fact
that
a
codefendant
is
blaming
something
else
--
mr.
james
h.
kline
no,
i
--
no,
your
honor.
i'm
asking
for
reconsideration
of
roberts
versus
russell.
my
discussion
here
is
only
applying
to
the
case
retroactively
and
i
would
hope
that
this
court
reconsider
roberts
and
i'm
just
trying
to
indicate
that
why
cases
before
bruton
should
not
be
--
should
not
have
to
comply
with
a
bruton's
new
constitutional
rule
because
of
the
fact
of
reliance.
for
over
70
years,
this
court
has
indicated
that
delli
paoli
procedure
is
all
right.
as
late
as
january
23,
1967
in
spencer
versus
texas,
this
court
has
cited
delli
paoli
and
indorsed
delli
paoli
and
as
late
as
june
12,
1967
a
gilbert
versus
california
this
court
declined
to
overrule
delli
paoli.
and
i
submit
that
as
late
as
1967
in
view
of
spencer
and
gilbert
that
it
would
been
have
most
difficult
to
predict
the
demise
of
delli
paoli.
it
should
be
nor
that
jackson
versus
denno
which
this
court
indicate
for
shall
bruton
was
decided
june
of
1964
and
gilbert
is
nearly
three
years
later
and
yet
this
court
declined
to
overrule
delli
paoli.
and
i
would
like
to
emphasize
the
fact
that
this
does
will
effect
the
significant
number
of
cases
throughout
the
courts,
throughout
the
land.
i
think
this
new
constitutional
rule
of
doctrine
of
bruton
should
be
prospectively
applied
because
bruton
only
assist
those
who
really
bond
together,
those
vicious
criminals
who
engaged
in
robbery
such
as
the
instant
case.
and
bruton
helps
those
criminals
who
have
been
in
jail,
the
longest
if
retroactivity
doctrine
is
still
adhere
to
by
this
court
that
means
that
a
conviction
is
20
years
old
would
have
to
be
reversed
and
the
chances
of
retrial
are
almost
de
minimis
because
of
the
fact
that
witnesses
cannot
be
located
and
the
fact
that
witnesses
recollection
fade.
a
fully
retroactive
bruton
along
with
the
fact
that
it
is
not
subject
to
a
harmless
error
rule
were
truly
have
a
profound
effect
on
administration
of
criminal
justice
throughout
in
every
jurisdiction.
this
is
demonstrated
by
the
fact
that
we
have
over
28
amici
joined
respondent.
they
show
us
the
concern
of
the
states
as
to
applying
this
rule
retroactively.
so
i
earnestly
solicit
this
court
and
earnestly
ask
this
court
to
reconsider
roberts
versus
russell
since
roberts
versus
russell
had
not
been
briefed
and
these
considerations
are
not
being
brought
to
the
court's
attention
before
its
decision.
so
therefore,
we
would
urge
that
the
judgment
of
the
lower
court
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
mr.
james
h.
kline
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
james
h.
kline
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
respondent
and
the
amici
joined
the
respondent
are
verily
concerned
of
the
impact
of
bruton
versus
united
states
and
roberts
versus
russell.
we
feel
that
these
two
cases
will
have
a
profound
effect
on
the
administration
of
justice
throughout
the
various
states.
now,
petitioner
harrington
would
expand
the
impact
of
these
two
cases
by,
one,
making
a
bruton
error
per
se
reversible
without
applying
any
type
of
harmless
error
standard
and
two,
by
making
bruton
fully
retroactive.
at
this
point,
i
would
like
to
tell
this
court
the
experience
of
california
as
the
joint
trials.
we
have
a
penal
code
statute
which
authorizes
joint
trials
and
we
have
obtained
statistics
from
the
los
angeles
district
attorney's
office
with
regard
to
joint
trials.
for
the
years
1967
and
1968,
statistics
for
these
two
years,
from
this
particular
county
reflect
that
approximately
20%
of
the
trials
involved
two
or
more
defendants.
now,
if
this
percentage
prevails
throughout
the
state.
this
represents
a
sizeable
number
of
cases
in
california.
for
instance
in
1967,
there
was
a
total
of
13,500
contested
criminal
matters
tried
in
the
superior
of
court
of
california.
in
1968,
there
was
a
total
of
16,140
contested
criminal
matters
tried
in
the
superior
courts
throughout
the
state.
as
you
can
tell
the
figures
are
progressingly
getting
higher
and
if
you
go
back
10
years,
you
go
back
20
years,
you
go
back
30
years.
the
adequate
number
of
cases
affected
by
bruton
is
truly
staggering.
now,
let's
turn
our
attention
to
mr.
hanson's
first
contention
that
the
chapman
harmless
error
rule
is
not
applicable
to
a
bruton
type
situation.
as
i
have
indicated
in
my
brief,
the
vast
number
of
cases
subsequent
to
bruton
which
had
discussed
this
issue
have
held
that
bruton
is
not
automatically
reversible.
i
submit
that
logic
and
some
policy
support
this
rule.
it
is
obvious
that
there
are
material
variances
in
codefendant's
statements
with
regard
as
to
their
incubating
effect
as
well
as
to
whether
the
fact
they
added
critical
weight
to
the
prosecution's
case.
now,
if
an
automatic
reversal
rule
is
adopted
by
this
court,
then
a
bruton
situation
would
be
reversed
regardless
if
the
particular
error
conceivably
played
any
part
in
the
verdict
either
on
direct
appeal
or
on
collateral
attack.
indirectly,
you
--
this
court
has
indicated
in
gilbert
versus
california
that
a
harmless
error
rule
is
applicable
to
a
bruton
type
situation.
there,
if
you
recall
the
petitioner
had
a
confession
used
against
the
man
which
he
was
mentioned
approximately
159
times.
the
petition
--
the
petitioner
there
requested
that
this
court
overrule
delli
paoli
at
that
time.
and
this
court
declined
to
do
so
noting
that
the
california
supreme
court
had
adopted
in
random
we
have
--
which
had
rejected
delli
paoli.
this
court
also
noted
that
the
california
supreme
court
had
held
the
particular
bruton
error
harmless
in
griffin
and
in
this
court
noted
that
the
harmless
error
standard
applied
by
the
california
supreme
court
was
substantially
and
compliance
with
fahey
and
chapman.
therefore,
this
court
declined
to
rule
on
overrule
a
delli
paoli
at
that
time.
now,
i
would
submit
that
the
fair
import
of
these
remarks
is
that
bruton
is
subject
to
a
chapman's
harmless
errors
standard.
it
should
be
noted
that
the
bruton
case
was
an
extreme
case
factually.
the
codefendant's
statement
was
not
admissible.
i
guess
the
codefendant
evans
as
a
result
since
it
was
inadmissible
against
evans
there
is
nothing
on
the
other
hand
in
which
to
alleviate
any
possible
prejudice
against
bruton.
also,
the
identification
evidence
was
much
weaker
against
bruton
than
against
evans.
and
as
a
result
on
retrial,
evans
was
acquitted
and
so
therefore
the
solicitor
general
indicated
because
of
these
facts
that
case
should
be
reversed.
now,
we
contend
that
the
evidence
in
the
instant
case
is
much
stronger
than
was
the
situation
in
bruton.
before
i
apply
the
chapman
harmless
error
standard
to
the
instant
case,
i
would
like
to
delineate
six
factors
which
i
think
is
pertinent
to
any
inquiry
in
applying
chapman
to
a
bruton
type
situation.
the
first
situation
--
the
first
factor
to
consider
of
course
is
the
quality
of
the
limiting
instruction
given
by
the
trial
judge.
if
a
particularly
lucid
and
precise
instruction
is
probably
given
to
the
jury
before
the
statement
is
introduced
in
the
evidence,
i
would
think
this
would
help
alleviate
some
of
the
prejudice
of
an
incriminating
statement.
and
i
note
with
interest
frazier
versus
cupp
which
was
rendered
by
this
court
yesterday
and
which
in
the
context
of
an
opening
statement
this
court
indicated
that
a
limiting
instruction
can
be
affected
to
that
extent.
the
second
factor
to
consider
of
course
is
the
nature
of
the
codefendant's
statement.
there,
the
defendant
assumed
his
fair
share
of
guilt.
this
court
noted
in
bruton
that
it
is
common
with
codefendants
to
shift
the
blame
but
if
the
defendant
assumes
his
fair
share
of
the
guilt
that
is
something
to
consider
also.
the
third
factor
to
consider
also
is
the
amount
of
detail
concerning
actions
of
other
parties.
in
other
words,
if
the
details
in
the
incriminating
confessions
is
quite
skimpy
in
comparison
with
the
other
prosecution
evidence,
i
would
think
this
would
be
a
pertinent
inquiring
applying
chapman.
the
fourth
factors
take
in
consideration
is
the
weight
of
the
other
evidence.
now,
if
the
weight
of
the
other
evidence
is
quite
strong
then
it
would
be
my
contention
that
it
would
--
the
jury
would
be
more
unlikely
to
disobey
a
court's
limiting
instruction.
and
the
fifth
factor
to
consider
of
course
is
the
nature
of
the
defense.
did
the
defendant
offer
any
testimony
in
support
of
his
defense
or
did
he
just
put
the
prosecution
to
its
proof.
mr.
james
h.
kline
i'm
sorry.
i
didn't
here
that
your
honor.
mr.
james
h.
kline
yes.
mr.
james
h.
kline
yes
your
honor.
i
think
that
is
a
pertinent
factor
to
consider
in
applying
chapman.
mr.
james
h.
kline
yes.
there
are
three
codefendants
your
honor
who
did,
whose
statement
were
introduced
in
evidence
but
has
been
admitted
by
counsel
rose
confession
it
is
not
subject
to
a
bruton
type
error
because
he
was
--
mr.
james
h.
kline
because
he
was
--
he
did
testify
on
the
stand.
he
was
available
for
cross-examination
and
all
the
parties
did
in
fact
cross-examined
him
and
in
that
regard
i'd
like
to
emphasize
the
fact
that
rhone
did
admit
making
his
statement
enhance
the
situation
with
erroneous
vastly
different
from
douglas
versus
alabama
where
are
the
guys
of
refreshing
a
witnesses
recollection
the
prosecutor
asked
the
witness
to
either
deny
or
affirm
certain
statements
that
he
made
in
his
confession.
this
court
indicated
that
since
the
witness
declined
to
answering
this
question
that
the
other
codefendant
was
denied
his
right
of
confrontation
because
he
had
not
admitted
making
such
a
statement.
now,
that
situation
is
different
from
this
situation
because
rhone
did
admit
to
make
such
a
statement.
mr.
james
h.
kline
that's
correct.
in
that
regard,
like
the
--
mr.
james
h.
kline
yes,
that's
true
your
honor
but
before
i
turn
my
attention
to
the
other
two
confessions,
i
would
like
to
emphasize
the
fact
that
rhone
is
the
only
person
that
does
name
petitioner
harrington
and
he's
the
only
one
that
details
the
activities
of
rhone
both
before
the
robbery
and
after
the
robbery.
rhone
was
quite
explicit
in
telling
where
harrington
was
while
in
the
store
at
the
different
events
that
occurred
in
the
store.
he
also
indicated
that
--
mr.
james
h.
kline
no,
they
did
not.
the
only
reference
is
to
a
white
man
and
in
that
regard
i
would
like
to
turn
my
attention
to
bosby
statement.
mr.
james
h.
kline
your
honor,
i'm
very
happy
you
asked
the
question
because
i
think
the
lower
court
has
used
a
standard
which
is
the
equivalent
of
chapman
and
may
i
refer
your
honor
to
page
437
of
the
single
appendix
in
which
the
--
is
part
of
the
opinion
of
a
lower
state
court.
now,
the
lower
state
court
summarized
the
admissible
evidence
besides
the
three
codefendants'
confessions
and
they
said
that
in
summarize
in
the
admissible
constitutional
evidence
"it
is
virtually
inconceivable
that
any
jury
could
have
escaped
the
conclusion
that
harrington
was
engaged
in
attempted
robbery
and
was
answerable
for
the
murder
committed
by
his
coconspirator
in
the
course
thereof."
now,
it's
our
contention
that
it
is
virtually
inconceivable
is
the
equivalent
of
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
mr.
james
h.
kline
your
honor
i
think
the
precise
language
of
the
court
is
that
it
is
virtually
inconceivable
that
any
jury
could
have
escaped
to
conclusion.
so,
i
think
the
court
itself
has
answered
your
honor's
question.
mr.
james
h.
kline
your
honor,
i
would
disagree
with
the
test
as
you
proposed
it.
mr.
james
h.
kline
i
would
agree
would
appear
--
goes
two
different
matters
but
i
would
disagree
with
the
applicability
of
that
particular
statute.
mr.
james
h.
kline
yes,
the
jury
as
a
whole
because
after
all
the
juries
--
mr.
james
h.
kline
well,
i
think
the
court
can
look
at
the
case
as
a
whole,
evidence
as
a
whole
and
determine
if
any
particular
error
in
the
context
of
the
evidence
as
a
whole
is
prejudicial
whether
a
jury
could've
conceivably
risk
any
different
verdict
but
for
the
fact
there
was
not
admitted.
mr.
james
h.
kline
yes
i
would
think
so,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
james
h.
kline
well,
--
mr.
james
h.
kline
yes,
i
would
agree
of
that
position.
yes
your
honor.
mr.
james
h.
kline
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
h.
kline
yes,
your
honor.
it
is
true
the
standard
utilized
by
the
lower
court
that
the
state
harmless
error
standard
but
it
is
my
contention
in
view
of
the
language
of
the
lower
court
that
the
harmless
error
standard
utilized
as
such
is
the
equivalent
of
chapman.
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
in
gilbert
versus
california,
a
comparable
situation
was
thereto.
there,
the
california
supreme
court
had
utilized
the
state
harmless
error
standard
in
reference
to
griffin
error
and
the
--
this
court
indicated
that
that
standard
was
substantially
equivalent
of
fahey
and
chapman
as
a
result
indicated
that
it
may
not
overruled
delli
paoli.
so,
i
would
indicate
that
the
same
reasoning
it
can
be
applied
here
since
it
is
the
--
it
is
virtually
inconceivable
as
what
i
would
equate
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
now,
let's
turn
our
attention
to
bosby's
statement.
in
regard
to
bosby's
statement
counsel
for
petitioner
harrington
made
an
interesting
comment.
this
is
contained
at
page
237
of
the
single
appendix.
and
his
state
as
follows
in
reference
to
bosby's
statement
"largely
here
in
the
bosby
statement
we
have
a
statement
which
is
not
in
essence
terribly
incriminating
against
harrington
as
it
was
originally
given.
he
didn't
even
know
harrington's
name."
and
that's
true,
he
didn't
even
know
harrington's
first
name.
he
further
described
harrington
as
a
blonde
headed
fellow
and
this
is
contained
at
page
286
of
the
single
appendix.
all
the
prosecution
witnesses
in
the
instant
case
indicated
that
the
defendant
was
red-haired
man
that
he
had
a
bright
red
shinny
hair
and
yet
bosby
describes
him
as
a
blonde
headed
fellow
and
if
the
jury
literally
followed
that
description
they
would
think
that
some
other
defendant
besides
harrington
was
involved.
furthermore,
in
comparison
with
rhone's
confession
as
compared
to
bosby's
confession
the
details
of
the
white
man
is
extremely
limited
for
instance,
bosby
indicated
that
he
presumed
that
the
white
man
entered
the
store
with
charles.
bosby
did
not
know
where
the
white
man
was
at
the
time
of
the
gunshot.
furthermore,
bosby
never
saw
him
with
a
gun.
so,
when
you
compare
harrington's
statement
which
is
not
--
i
mean
when
you
compare
rhone's
statement
which
does
not
fall
within
the
bruton
ambit,
bosby's
statement
is
extremely
limited
with
reference
to
the
incriminating
details
as
to
the
white
man's
role
in
the
robbery.
now,
let's
turn
our
attention
to
the
two
statements
of
cooper.
cooper
actually
made
two
statements.
the
first
statement
of
course
is
an
exculpatory
statement.
there,
he
denied
any
involvement
in
the
crime
whatsoever.
he
merely
indicate
that
he
entered
the
store,
approached
this
cashier's
register,
attempted
to
cash
a
check,
and
noticed
that
there's
a
scuffle
subsequent
gun
shot,
he
became
frightened
he
then
ran
out
the
store,
got
in
his
car
and
three
other
people
got
in
his
car.
interesting
enough,
he
mentions
the
fact
that
there
were
other
caucasians
around
the
store
before
he
entered
the
store.
while
he
is
attempting
the
cash
to
check
at
the
cash
register,
he
indicates
that
there
was
a
white
guy
behind
him.
now,
we
don't
know
that
this
white
guy
that
was
behind
and
refers
to
petitioner
harrington
to
some
other
caucasian
who
--
that
cooper
had
made
reference
to
before.
he
also
indicated
that
there
is
a
white
boy
in
cooper's
car
at
the
time
cooper
got
in
the
car.
at
no
time
did
cooper
get
in
to
--
at
no
time
did
cooper
see
the
white
boy
with
a
gun
which
is
again
a
variance
with
the
prosecution
testimony.
details
of
the
white
man's
role
in
the
robbery
is
even
more
skimpy
than
bosby's
confession.
now,
cooper
second
statement
that
is
the
cooper's
confession
is
only
three
pages
long.
it
has
a
few
more
details
of
what
the
white
man
did.
now,
the
four
of
them
did
go
to
the
store,
four
of
them
did
go
into
the
store,
the
white
man
followed
cooper
into
the
store
and
that
is
the
only
reference
that
we
have
with
reference
to
the
white
man
as
to
cooper's
confession.
again,
we
don't
know
what
transpired
in
the
store,
we
don't
know
whether
harrington
had
a
gun,
we
don't
know
whether
harrington
tried
to
get
in
the
cash
register
or
not,
in
short,
the
references
to
cooper
and
bosby's
statement
are
very
limited
in
describing
the
activities
of
the
white
man
involved
in
the
store.
the
white
man's
role
implying
the
robbery,
we
don't
know
about
and
comparison
with
rhone's
confession.
rhone
is
quite
explicit
on
all
these
things
and
i
would
contend
that
cooper's
and
bosby's
statement
are
merely
cumulative
of
detail
which
was
admissible
in
rhone's
confession.
in
addition,
the
other
address
presented
by
the
prosecution
was
exceedingly
strong
for
this
was
no
circumstantial
evidence
as
was
the
situation
in
chapman.
we
have
not
two
witnesses.
we
have
three
witnesses
who
positively
identified
petitioner
harrington.
we
have
mrs.
robins,
the
proprietor
of
the
store,
her
brother
mr.
ashbreath
(ph)
as
well
as
a
customer
by
the
name
of
mrs.
williams.
now,
two
of
these
witnesses
described
harrington
as
a
red-haired
chap.
it
should
be
noted
at
the
time
of
trial
harrington
did
not
have
red
hair.
he
had
black
hair
because
harrington
had
dyed
his
hair
black
after
the
robbery.
and
i
would
claim
that
this
is
significant
in
strengthening
their
identification
since
they
recognized
the
fact
that
this
was
the
red
haired
chap
that
they
had
seen
going
into
the
store.
furthermore,
we
have
harrington's
very
incriminating
statements
he
made
to
the
police.
harrington
admitted
the
fact
that
he
was
the
red
hair
chap
that
had
entered
the
store
with
three
negro
companions
that
after
the
murder
he
run
to
the
car
with
three
other
negroes
that
subsequent
thereto
he
dyed
his
hair
red,
he
shaved
off
his
red
mustache
and
i
must
agree
with
the
lower
court
it
is
virtually
inconceivable
that
any
jury
would
have
concluded
come
to
any
other
conclusion
that
it
did
even
absent
the
error
of
admitting
bosby
and
cooper's
statements.
furthermore,
i
would
think
that
the
--
as
i've
indicated
earlier
i
think
the
lower
court
has
resolved
the
harmless
error
using
a
chapman
test
and
i
would
analogize
to
the
situation
in
gilbert
versus
california
which
this
court
indicated
that
when
a
california
supreme
court
utilized
a
standard
comparable
to
chapman
that
was
permissible
and
i
would
think
the
lower
court
did
since
the
lower
did
the
same
thing
in
the
instant
case
that
should
--
that
rational
should
be
applicable
here
also.
next,
i
would
like
to
discuss
retroactivity.
i
approached
this
subject
with
the
little
bit
of
concern.
it
is
my
purpose
in
discussing
retroactivity
with
the
hope
that
you
would
reconsider
roberts
versus
russell.
now,
this
court
has
indicated
there
are
three
criteria
in
determining
whether
rule
should
be
prospectively
applied
or
retroactively
applied.
they
are
the
purpose
of
the
rule,
the
reliance
on
the
old
rule,
the
effect
on
the
administration
of
justice.
now,
the
purpose
of
bruton
obviously
is
to
insure
the
reliability
of
the
fact
find
process
but
that
purpose
may
not
necessitate
the
fact
that
the
rule
has
to
be
applied
retroactively.
for
instance,
in
johnson
versus
new
jersey,
this
court
indicated
it's
a
question
of
probability.
she
have
to
look
to
see
if
there's
other
safeguards
and
by
comparison
i
would
compare
the
situation
in
stovall
versus
denno
which
this
court
limited
the
retroactivity
as
the
line
of
cases.
now,
surely
there
can
be
no
greater
effecting
of
the
reliability
of
fact-finding
process
than
to
have
this
suggested
lineup
and
a
mistaken
identification.
certainly
that
leads
to
miscarriage
of
justice.
yet,
this
court
indicated
that
in
that
situation
you
decided
to
limit
retroactivity.
now,
i
would
quarrel
with
this
court
with
the
fact
that
bruton
does
not
affect
the
integrity
of
the
factfinding
process.
to
me,
it
does
not
and
i
would
rely
on
the
language
of
judge
learned
hand
who
stated
that
while
bruton,
delli
paoli
procedure
rest
on
a
fiction
it
still
helps
the
jury
in
ascertaining
the
truth
and
i
would
like
to
emphasize
the
fact
that
statement
of
codefendant's
traditionally
have
been
viewed
with
suspicion
and
distrust.
a
statement
of
a
person
himself
has
a
lot
more
impact
on
a
jury
that
a
statement
of
a
codefendant
who's
blaming
somebody
else
and
i
would
submit
that
a
limiting
instruction
in
the
proper
case
in
view
of
the
fact
that
a
codefendant
is
blaming
something
else
--
mr.
james
h.
kline
no,
i
--
no,
your
honor.
i'm
asking
for
reconsideration
of
roberts
versus
russell.
my
discussion
here
is
only
applying
to
the
case
retroactively
and
i
would
hope
that
this
court
reconsider
roberts
and
i'm
just
trying
to
indicate
that
why
cases
before
bruton
should
not
be
--
should
not
have
to
comply
with
a
bruton's
new
constitutional
rule
because
of
the
fact
of
reliance.
for
over
70
years,
this
court
has
indicated
that
delli
paoli
procedure
is
all
right.
as
late
as
january
23,
1967
in
spencer
versus
texas,
this
court
has
cited
delli
paoli
and
indorsed
delli
paoli
and
as
late
as
june
12,
1967
a
gilbert
versus
california
this
court
declined
to
overrule
delli
paoli.
and
i
submit
that
as
late
as
1967
in
view
of
spencer
and
gilbert
that
it
would
been
have
most
difficult
to
predict
the
demise
of
delli
paoli.
it
should
be
nor
that
jackson
versus
denno
which
this
court
indicate
for
shall
bruton
was
decided
june
of
1964
and
gilbert
is
nearly
three
years
later
and
yet
this
court
declined
to
overrule
delli
paoli.
and
i
would
like
to
emphasize
the
fact
that
this
does
will
effect
the
significant
number
of
cases
throughout
the
courts,
throughout
the
land.
i
think
this
new
constitutional
rule
of
doctrine
of
bruton
should
be
prospectively
applied
because
bruton
only
assist
those
who
really
bond
together,
those
vicious
criminals
who
engaged
in
robbery
such
as
the
instant
case.
and
bruton
helps
those
criminals
who
have
been
in
jail,
the
longest
if
retroactivity
doctrine
is
still
adhere
to
by
this
court
that
means
that
a
conviction
is
20
years
old
would
have
to
be
reversed
and
the
chances
of
retrial
are
almost
de
minimis
because
of
the
fact
that
witnesses
cannot
be
located
and
the
fact
that
witnesses
recollection
fade.
a
fully
retroactive
bruton
along
with
the
fact
that
it
is
not
subject
to
a
harmless
error
rule
were
truly
have
a
profound
effect
on
administration
of
criminal
justice
throughout
in
every
jurisdiction.
this
is
demonstrated
by
the
fact
that
we
have
over
28
amici
joined
respondent.
they
show
us
the
concern
of
the
states
as
to
applying
this
rule
retroactively.
so
i
earnestly
solicit
this
court
and
earnestly
ask
this
court
to
reconsider
roberts
versus
russell
since
roberts
versus
russell
had
not
been
briefed
and
these
considerations
are
not
being
brought
to
the
court's
attention
before
its
decision.
so
therefore,
we
would
urge
that
the
judgment
of
the
lower
court
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
mr.
james
h.
kline
thank
you,
your
honor.
