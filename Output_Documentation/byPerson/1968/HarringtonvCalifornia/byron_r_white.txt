i
take
it
if
only
rhone
had
involved
here,
there
wouldn't
been
any
problem
on
the
root?
justice
byron

but
it
did
concern
the
harmless
error
where
the
confessions
of
any
--
where
rhone
as
far
as
harrington
was
concerned,
was
there
any
measure
or
difference
mean
rhone's
confession
and
the
confession
of
the
other
two?
justice

so,
in
terms
of
the
--
so,
in
terms
of
impact
on
harrington,
his
ability
to
cross-examine
rhone
maybe
--
wouldn't
that
in
many
go
to
be
in
the
cross
examine
of
the
other
two?
justice
byron
r.
white
definite
it
would?
justice
byron

did
you
say
the
confessions
of
the
other
two
did
not
name
harrington?
justice
byron

white
or
with
other
confessions?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
it's
the
defendant's
own
confession
(voice
overlap)
illegally
introduced?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
don't
get
the
harmless
error
in
those
cases?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
just
the
--
well,
coerced
confession.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
why?
because
it's
a
confession?
justice
byron
r.
white
most
especially
damaging
evidence?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
the
question
of
the
defendant
of
the
codefendant.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
the
point
i
was
making.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
you
would
--
i
suppose
that
if
the
man's
own
confession
may
be
--
are
more
reliable?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
right
but
bruton
involved
a
confession
to
somebody
else.
justice
byron
r.
white
as
i
said
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
you
have
--
i
suppose
some
very
similar
argument
in
what
you
got
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
other
two
confessions
didn't
mention
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
rhone
never
said
in
the
other
two
in
their
confession
never
said
that
the
only
white
man
was
harrington?
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
for
reconsideration,
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
any
he
also
says
--
he
also
says
and
apparently
without
meaning
to
make
any
difference
between
the
two
perhaps
that
absent
the
constitutionally
forbidden
comments
whether
honest,
fair-minded
jurors
might
very
well
have
brought
in
not
guilty
verdicts,
that's
the
suit.
did
you
consider
that
