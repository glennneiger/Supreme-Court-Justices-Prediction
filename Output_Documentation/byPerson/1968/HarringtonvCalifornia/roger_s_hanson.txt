mr.
roger
s.
hanson
chief
justice
warren,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
first-degree
murder
case
out
of
the
state
of
california
from
the
city
of
los
angeles
and
my
client
mr.
harrington
according
to
evidence
participated
in
the
robbery
of
a
liquor
store
in
the
city
of
los
angeles
along
with
three
other
codefendants.
the
interesting
thing
about
it
was
the
--
three
of
the
codefendants
were
negro,
mr.
harrington
was
a
caucasian,
and
that
is
a
significant
factor
which
i'll
point
out
as
we
go
along
here
a
little
bit.
the
court
held
the
preliminary
hearing
in
the
case,
according
to
california
procedure,
and
at
the
time
of
the
preliminary
hearing
why
it
showed
quite
conclusively
that
there's
going
to
be
a
lot
of
problems
in
the
way
of
confessions.
it
seems
that
all
three
of
the
other
codefendants
mr.
rhone,
mr.
bosby,
and
mr.
cooper
had
made
confessions
which
implicated
themselves
and
each
other
and
mr.
harrington
in
this
particular
crime.
at
the
time
of
the
trial
setting
in
various
preliminary
motions
counsel
for
mr.
harrington
attempted
to
get
a
severance
of
the
trials
because
of
this
problem
and
at
that
time
he
cited
case
of
delli
paoli
versus
united
states
and
the
jackson
versus
denno
decision
of
this
court
in
an
effort
to
get
these
trials
severed.
these
motions
were
denied
by
the
trial
court.
and
at
various
times
during
the
trial
motions
were
made
to
sever
the
thing
each
time
as
to
harrington
being
denied.
i
think
it
rather
interesting
that
throughout
this
trial,
numerous
pages
were
devoted
to
in-chambers
discussion
between
the
counsel
and
the
court
in
an
effort
to
alter
these
various
confessions
in
such
a
way
that
no
incriminating
statements
were
made
as
to
one
man
versus
the
other.
i
set
that
out
in
my
brief
and
it's
contained
in
the
single
appendix
for
the
court
and
i
think
it's
very
exemplary
of
the
impossibility
in
this
particular
case
that
is
in
most
cases
to
make
a
meaningful
deletion
of
the
names
to
the
point
where
in
this
case
it
became
so
ridiculous
that
the
court
upon
being
accused
by
mr.
harrington's
attorney
at
that
time
of
trying
to
make
the
matter
more
difficult
for
his
counsel
said,
"i'm
going
to
let
all
of
these
confessions
going
in
just
the
way
they
stand
unedited."
now,
mr.
rhone
made
the
confession
which
was
probably
the
most
damaging
and
i
suppose
the
single
possibly
weak
point
in
my
position
here
is
that
mr.
rhone
in
fact
did
take
the
stand
for
cross-examination.
the
other
two
gentlemen,
mr.
cooper
and
mr.
bosby
are
referred
to
mr.
harrington
as
the
white
man,
the
caucasian
and
various
other
terms
never
actually
calling
him
by
name
which
is
a
probably
cause
of
the
fact
that
they
didn't
know
each
other
too
well.
and
so
in
that
particular
sense
neither
one
of
the
other
two
actually
named
mr.
harrington
but
without
a
doubt
because
all
four
of
them
were
being
jointly
tried,
all
four
of
them
setting
at
the
counsel
table
together,
three
negroes
and
the
caucasian
mr.
harrington
coupled
with
mr.
rhone's
confession
actually
naming
mr.
harrington
where
there's
little
doubt
that
in
my
opinion
all
four
these
confessions,
there
are
three
of
the
confessions,
solidified
each
other
and
brought
home
the
inevitable
result
that
took
place
in
this
particular
trial.
now,
it's
my
contention
here
of
course
when
i
filed
the
petition
for
certiorari
of
this
court
it
was
prior
to
the
decision
of
the
court
in
bruton
versus
united
states
and
roberts
versus
russell.
at
the
time
i
filed
petition,
i
was
going
after
a
reversal
of
the
delli
paoli
case
and
so
when
the
court
handed
down
the
bruton
decision,
roberts
versus
russell
decision,
i
anticipated
the
cases
being
remanded
to
the
second
district
court
of
appeals
in
california
with
the
usual
admonition
to
reconsider
the
case
in
a
matter
not
inconsistent
with
this
particular
opinion.
and
so
i
was
elated
to
have
a
chance
come
to
washington
when
the
court
granted
a
hearing
in
the
case.
it's
my
contention
upon
reviewing
all
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
the
prime
one
that
i
hang
my
head
on
is
the
brookhart
versus
janis
case,
384
u.s.
1
decision
by
mr.
justice
black
which
i've
cited
throughout
my
documents
that
i've
filed
that
if
there
was
a
denial
of
confrontation
of
witnesses
without
waiver
why
it
be
a
constitutional
error,
the
first
order
magnitude
and
no
amount
of
prejudice
--
one,
a
prejudice
would
save
this
error
from
the
case.
of
course
in
the
brookhart
case
as
the
court
knows
with
malice
aforethought,
the
confession
of
the
codefendant
was
actually
used
against
mr.
brookhart.
it
was
introduced
for
that
particular
purpose
and
so
the
court
without
hesitation
in
an
eight-man
opinion
by
mr.
justice
black
reversed
that
case
without
recourse
to
any
consideration
of
harmless
error
rule.
in
the
bruton
case
then
if
i
interpret
that
case
correctly
the
court
went
on
to
acknowledge
that
in
its
opinion
it
would
be
impossible
for
a
jury
to
discern
the
difference
between
confession
to
this
type
being
given
by
(a)
with
an
instruction
do
not
consider
against
(b)
only
considered
against
(a)
never
against
(b),
by
mr.
justice
brennan
in
that
case
if
i
add
brookhart
to
bruton,
it's
my
position
in
front
of
this
court
today
that
it
calls
for
an
automatic
reversal
of
this
case
and
all
such
cases
on
a
national
basis
without
recourse
to
any
harmless
error
rules
whatsoever.
now,
in
the
concurring
opinion
by
mr.
justice
stewart
in
chapman
versus
california
there
is
numerous
type
of
errors
at
the
setout
which
call
for
automatic
reversal.
as
i
understand
mr.
justice
stewart
in
that
case
you
took
position
that
no
harmless
error
rule
should
be
applied
at
all
with
these
particular
type
of
errors.
and
as
i
go
through
the
various
types
of
cases
that
this
court
has
passed
judgment
on
the
gideon
versus
wainwright
type
of
denial
at
counsel
reversed
without
recourse
to
a
harmless
error
and
retroactively
so.
the
jackson
versus
denno
case
which
is
a
very
analogous
type
of
error
reversed
without
the
recourse
to
a
harmless
error
rule,
retroactively
so.
in
other
words,
we
have
in
one
hand
as
i
study
the
cases,
the
type
of
errors
that
actually
took
place
during
the
trial
itself
the
denial
of
counsel
at
trial.
the
introduction
of
course
confessions,
this
type
of
thing
which
actually
permeated
at
the
very
trial
itself
as
opposed
to
certain
pretrial
type
of
maneuvers
in
the
way
of
the
miranda
errors
where
the
court
said
that
it's
a
reason
for
reversing
and
not
making
it
retroactive
was
because
of
the
fact
it
wanted
to
discourage
police
conduct
in
this
errors.
the
search
and
seizure
issues
of
course
are
along
the
same
line
but
this
type
of
error
which
we
have
in
front
of
the
court
today;
to
me,
there
can
be
no
question
whatsoever
that
it
has
to
be
resulting
in
a
reversal
without
recourse
to
any
harmless
error
rules
whatsoever.
i
think
based
to
my
own
personal
experience
in
los
angeles
and
trying
some
major
cases
that
i
can
think
of
no
more
severe
error
that
a
defense
counsel
would
have
to
attempt
to
overcome
in
this
particular
one
that
took
place
in
this
case.
i
think
it
alters
entirely
the
defense
of
the
case.
the
state
of
illinois
in
its
amicus
curiae
brief
pointed
out
that
after
all
mr.
harrington
did
no
more
than
what
the
state
of
california
to
its
test
to
see
if
it
had
enough
evidence
to
convict
him,
he
did
not
take
the
stand.
he
put
on
next
to
no
defense
whatsoever
and
i
simply
contend
and
point
out
to
the
court
that
in
my
opinion
when
a
magnitudinal
error
such
as
three
confessions
were
introduced
against
him.
the
entire
strategy
of
the
case
would
change.
he
was
--
i
must
admit
a
previous
loser.
he'd
been
doing
time
up
in
san
quentin
for
previous
crimes.
he
therefore
had
the
problem
that
he
would
be
impeached
as
a
witness
by
previous
convictions
of
a
felony
and
so
the
counsel
at
that
time
apparently
elected
to
not
put
him
on
the
stand
and
so
forth.
therefore,
i
contend
the
entire
strategy
of
the
trial
is
altered
by
this
particular
difficulty
and
it's
impossible
for
any
reviewing
court
to
say
with
any
certainty
that
harmless
error
did
not
take
place
if
the
court
is
constrained
to
even
apply
harmless
error
rule
to
it.
the
--
this
court
of
course
is
considered
in
analogous
situation
in
the
barber
versus
page
case
of
the
past
term
where
the
preliminary
hearing
testimony
was
introduced
at
the
trial
without
making
an
effort
to
get
the
witness
in
front
of
the
court.
again,
the
reversal
without
recourse
to
harmless
error
rules
and
in
the
recent
case
of
berger
versus
california,
the
court
made
it
again
retroactive.
and
i
can
only
conclude
that
this
court
did
the
requisite
amount
of
soul
searching
during
the
deliberations
in
chambers
as
to
the
magnitude
of
this
particular
error.
i
don't
think
the
court
would
make
an
error
of
this
magnitude
retroactive
and
unless
it
considered
it
to
be
a
severe
one,
tremendously
severe
one.
and
it's
my
contention
that
because
of
this
severity
of
this
error,
it
is
not
at
all
applicable
to
any
type
of
harmless
error
rules
that
must
be
reversed
per
se
throughout
the
nation
when
this
type
of
thing
takes
place.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
no,
your
honor
he
did
not.
harrington
did
not
take
the
stand.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
mr.
rhone
took
the
stand.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
no,
actually
we
don't.
now,
on
california
--
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
that's
correct.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
no
question
about
it.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
apparently
not,
had
he
taken
the
stand
and
he
being
the
only
codefendant
apparently
we
wouldn't
have
the
bruton
problem
but
as
i
read
the
sixth
amendment
it
says
you
have
a
right
to
be
confronted
by
all
the
witnesses.
and
i
guess
it
didn't
--
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
no
actually
not,
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
probably
were
not
near
as
damaging
for
the
reason
i
didn't
name
him
per
se
like
mr.
rhone
did.
mr.
rhone
--
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
well,
that's
a
good
question.
i
contend
that
relying
on
the
sixth
amendment
--
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
it
has
to
--
has
to
be
the
all
the
witnesses.
i
can't
see
how
you
can
bifurcate
the
thing,
he
might
have
49
witnesses
who
didn't
take
the
stand
and
one
that
did.
and
it's
just
inconceivable
to
me
that
you
can
split
hairs
on
the
numbers
that
did
and
the
numbers
that
did
not.
this
was
a
very
severe
type
of
case
which
--
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
well,
did
not
name
and
explicitly
it's
referred
to
him
as
the
white
man,
the
caucasian,
the
paddy
and
things
of
this
nature
in
such
a
way
that
with
all
four
of
them,
sent
them
to
witness
table.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
there's
a
little
doubt
about
it
in
my
opinion.
i
remind
the
court
also
of
the
recent
decision
of
smith
versus
illinois
which
was
as
i
recall
the
major
issue
that
confronted
the
court
was
whether
the
question
of
a
witness
as
to
what
your
address
is
and
he
did
not
answer
before
the
answer
came
in.
the
court
sustained
an
objection
in
answering
that
question.
this
court
reversed
again
summarily
without
recourse
to
any
harmless
error
rules
with
the
simple
defect
as
i
understand
it
of
no
response
to
the
question
where
he
lives.
and
it
was
held
in
citing
again
with
the
approval
of
brookhart
versus
janis
case
that
if
there's
a
denial
of
confrontation
of
witnesses,
it
is
a
constitutional
error
the
first
order
magnitude
and
no
want
of
the
prejudice
will
save
it.
i
simply
--
in
reading
that
case,
to
which
eight
members
of
this
court
i
think
mr.
justice
marshall
was
not
on
the
order
at
the
time
he
did
not
participate
but
apparently
members
of
this
court
signed
their
name
to
it
subscribing
a
cent
to
the
words
of
mr.
justice
black
in
the
brookhart
versus
janis
case
that
this
type
of
thing
would
not
be
subject
to
any
type
of
harmless
error
rule.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
yes,
every
confession
is
in
the
record.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
well,
i
pointed
it
out;
i
did
not
index
my
copy
of
the
single
appendix.
mr.
cooper's
statement
begins
at
page
198
of
the
single
appendix.
mr.
bosby's
confession
is
on
273
of
the
single
appendix.
further
confession
by
cooper
on
page
321
of
the
single
appendix
and
mr.
rhone's
statements
397
of
the
single
appendix.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
and
so
forth.
there,
they're
spread
throughout
it.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
yes
i
am
and
by
enlarge,
i
might
move
on
to
that.
by
enlarge
the
chief
evidence
against
mr.
harrington
was
other
than
the
confession
was
a
couple
of
people
who
worked
in
the
store
who
fortunately
lived
to
tell
about
it.
the
proprietor
of
the
store
was
a
woman
and
another
male
clerk
was
in
the
store.
the
interesting
thing
about
it
was
when
these
people
reported
the
crime
and
made
their
statements
to
the
police,
the
man
without
hesitation
admitted
that
he
said
four
negroes
carried
this
crime
out.
the
woman
equivocated
somewhat
but
also
admitted
that
she
had
told
the
police
that
in
her
opinion
four
negroes
had
carried
the
crime
out.
it's
therefore
my
contention
that
an
astute
attorney
in
the
defense
of
these
gentlemen
at
least
in
defense
of
mr.
harrington,
absent
the
various
errors
that
have
occurred
in
this
case
which
certainly
have
a
fighting
chance
for
an
acquittal
in
the
case
because
if
they
cannot
tell
the
difference
between
caucasian
versus
negro,
well
perhaps
other
evidence
that
they
testified
to
would
be
much
weaker
also.
i
would
ask
the
court
to
in
its
opinion
attempt
to
spell
out
with
very
specificity
this
bruton,
roberts
versus
russell
error
that
has
been
one
that
has
hang
around
for
many,
many
years.
i'm
confident
if
the
court
does
not
spell
it
out
in
such
a
way
that
there
can
be
little
doubt
as
to
what
the
court
means.
the
court
is
going
to
be
inundated
with
petitions
for
certiorari
for
the
next
decade.
i
think
the
case
it
would
just
proceeded
this
one
banks
versus
california
is
the
excellent
example
of
the
fact
that
the
griffin
rule
was
apparently
still
being
emasculated
by
the
various
lower
level
courts
around
the
nation
and
to
me,
they
are
just
as
--
is
no
question
that
it
must
be
subjected
to
reversibility
per
se
if
the
brookhart
versus
janis
opinion
is
interpreted
correctly
by
myself.
i
just
can't
believe
that
this
type
of
error
has
any
different
in
the
gideon
versus
wainwright
error
if
i
look
at
the
sixth
amendment
and
read
it
i
see
the
right
of
counsel
and
the
right
to
confront
witnesses
in
the
same
paragraph.
i
could
read
that
short
portion
of
it.
i
would
assure
that
it's
more
familiar
to
the
court
than
myself
and
i
did
bring
along
with
it
because
i
saw
the
television
show
in
mr.
justice
black's
birthday
a
few
months
ago
where
you
referred
to
the
copy
of
the
constitution
that
you
carried
with
you.
and
so
i
had
it
along
with
me
in
case
i
had
to
refer
to
it
but
i
think
that
if
the
court
will
check
the
sixth
amendment,
it
goes
to
types
of
rights
are
set
forth
right
beside
each
other
in
the
sixth
amendment.
i
can't
see
that
they
can
therefore
be
distinguished
that
the
gideon
versus
wainwright
case
given
total
retroactivity
was
no
application
of
harmless
error
rules
so
must
the
error
in
the
harrington
case,
bruton
versus
united
states,
roberts
versus
russell,
must
likewise
be
given
reversal
without
recourse
to
any
harmless
error
rules
just
impossible
to
calculate
the
impact
of
this
type
of
thing
and
i
think
that
you
actually
have
to
get
in
and
--
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
that's
the
griffin
error.
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
i
do.
i
contend
that
it
stands
exactly
along
where
the
gideon
versus
wainwright
type
of
error
and
--
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
well,
--
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
well,
i
think
that's
--
i
think
one
that
is
of
the
same
magnitude,
it
has
so
been
held
--
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
well,
you
mean
the
miranda
type
error?
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
well,
the
course
--
no,
there's
no
harmless
error
in
coerced
confessions.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
well,
i
--
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
well,
i
read
your
majority
opinion
in
jackson
versus
denno
and
i
found
it
difficult
to
believe
you
could
dissent
in
the
bruton
case
the
way
you
did
but
perhaps
that's
because
i'm
not
a
student
after
disserting
the
differences.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
yes
i
know
and
i
contend
that's
much
more
damaging.
i
think
the
confession
of
a
man
himself
is
a
much
more
reliable
index
than
the
confession
of
the
codefendant
because
i
tried
the
case
--
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
well,
i
tried
the
case
in
los
angeles.
you
probably
will
hear
more
about
it,
it
involves
the
man
the
name
of
robert
massie
who
contends
that
he
has
a
right
to
be
executed
and
i
think
that
justice
douglas
stated
the
execution
here
a
few
weeks
ago
but
he
is
now
in
san
quentin,
he
contends
he
has
a
right
to
be
executed
and
the
supreme
court
of
california,
i
guess,
agrees
with
him
because
they
have
gone
along
with.
his
petitions
do
not
have
any
attorneys
representing
him
and
things
like
these.
but
i
tried
that
case
with
the
bruton
error
in
it,
i
mean
after
bruton
error
was
reversed
and
i
got
an
acquittal
of
this
man
and
of
his
codefendant
mr.
john
vater
(ph)
and
i
think
that
the
court,
anyone
that
has
to
check
the
impact
of
this
type
of
thing
get
in
and
try
it
one
time
and
it's
an
insurmountable
thing
when
the
codefendant
makes
a
confession
because
i
think
that
people
that
sit
on
the
jury
will
say
rightfully
so
that
only
somebody
with
a
work
mind
would
accuse
somebody.
but
in
the
massie
case,
very
clear
mr.
massie
came
down
the
second
time
testified
that
he
had
accused
mr.
vater
(ph)
this
crime
simply
because
he
got
mad
at
him
but
he
actually
was
not
with
him
just
because
he
got
mad
at
him.
in
this
particular
case,
the
inference
is
of
course
he
lied
about
it.
but
i
don't
think
a
confession
by
somebody
himself
would
be
subject
to
that
same
type
of
attack.
if
i
confess
that
i
committed
a
murder,
i
think
that's
a
pretty
reliable
index
of
guilt,
quite
reliable
as
opposed
to
my
accusing
somebody
else
and
sustaining
the
conviction
of
somebody
else
my
testimony
without
my
getting
on
the
stand
for
cross-examination.
i
still
have
difficulty
--
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
that's
what
i
contend
and
yet
jackson
versus
denno
this
was
reversed
per
se.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
and
you
feel
that's
not
the
same
difficulty?
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
i
read
that
but
i
still
don't
--
i
don't
understand
it.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
i'm
sure
that's
correct.
well,
i
already
referred
to
my
opponent
at
this
time
and
save
the
remaining
amount
of
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
chief
justice
warren,
may
it
please
the
court.
as
far
as
the
retroactivity
facts
of
this
case
go,
i'm
sure
this
court
has
pondered
that
time
and
time
again
in
its
decision
on
barber
versus
page
and
berger
versus
california.
i
feel
that
the
damage
that
is
going
to
take
place
in
this
nation
has
already
taking
place
by
the
judgment
of
retroactivity
by
this
court.
it's
my
contention
that
if
we're
going
to
have
a
minimum
of
litigation
in
this
country
at
appellate
level,
the
only
way
that
that
can
really
be
taking
care
of
is
a
reversibility
per
se
because
if
a
court
honestly,
honestly
applies
the
federal
harmless
error
rule
which
i
think
is
the
very
minimal
that
is
going
to
come
out
of
this
discussion
today.
if
it
honestly
applies
it,
it
has
to
declare
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt
that
the
error
complain
of
did
not
contribute
to
the
conviction.
and
i
simply
say
that
in
999
cases
out
of
a
hundred
or
out
of
a
thousand,
i
just
find
it
inconceivable
to
believe
that
if
a
court
honestly
applying
that
--
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
well,
i
simply
--
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
well,
in
the
chapman
decision,
the
court
says
purged
mr.
justice
black
we
prefer
the
approach
of
this
court
deciding
what
was
harmless
error
in
our
recent
case
of
fahy
versus
connecticut.
there,
we
said,
"the
question
is
whether
there
was
a
reasonable
possibility
that
the
evidence
complained
of
might
have
contributed
to
the
conviction"
and
a
little
bit
later
justice
black
says,
there
is
little
if
any
difference
between
our
statement
and
fahy
versus
connecticut
about
"whether
there
was
a
reasonable
possibility
that
the
evidence
complained
of
might
have
contributed
to
the
conviction"
in
requiring
the
beneficiary
of
the
constitutional
error
to
prove
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
the
error
complain
of
did
not
contribute
to
the
verdict
obtained.
and
that
would
seem
to
me
that
if
--
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
well,
i
think
it's
indulging
in
the
type
of
analysis
that
mr.
justice
harlan
commented
on
a
little
bit
ago
attempting
to
second
guess
lay
jury.
i
think
it's
dangerous
and
i
also
think
that
any
court
honestly
applying
that
federal
harmless
error
rule
cannot
come
to
any
other
conclusion
that
a
majority
of
this
case
is
must
reversed.
and
i
know
from
experience
in
california
that
the
lower
courts
out
there
are
not
going
to
do
it
because
you're
too
close
to
the
ball
game
out
there.
there's
been
crimes
have
been
committed
in
the
state,
the
people
are
in
sense
about
it,
you
have
to
take
him
to
washington
where
we
have
nine
men
that
take
a
little
distant
viewpoint
of
these
things
and
analyze
them
on
the
basis
of
what
has
been
promulgated
by
this
court
heretofore.
and
i
think
it's
very
clear
that
the
federal
harmless
error
rules
are
very
minimal
thing
that's
going
to
be
applied
to
this
case
if
it
is
applied
to
all
and
i
contend
this
court
really
is
not
going
to
apply
it.
i
think
that
if
the
court
applies
in
brookhart
versus
janis
case
with
the
bruton
case
--
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
well,
perhaps
there
is
no
great
difference.
i
gathered
mr.
justice
harlan
felt
that
might
be
some
problem
in
attempting
to
for
a
court
to
say
to
a
--
to
put
itself
in
the
position
of
a
jury
and
say,
do
we
as
the
court
think
that
this
jury
would've
come
up
with
difference.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
well,
--
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
well,
there's
a
little
doubt
in
my
mind
that
jurors
can't
tell
the
difference
in
this
error
because
our
supreme
court
in
california
has
exceeded
that
even
further
than
that.
they
have
granted
the
fact
that
even
judges
can't
tell
it.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
well,
i
agree
that's
the
problem
i
think
that
if
the
court
will
not
apply
harmless
error
we
don't
have
the
problem.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
well,
i
just
can't
believe
that
an
error
of
this
magnitude
can
ever
be
said
noncontributory.
i
just
can't
believe
that
it
can
be
done.
it's
beyond
my
concept.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
yes.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
well,
i
don't
agree
with
that
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
well,
they
certainly
did
by
describing
very
well
--
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
well,
i'm
aware
of
that
but
if
that
argument
holds
any
water
then
they
must
have
convicted
him
on
something
else
beside
those
statements
because
if
the
statements
were
to
be
believed
that
they
were
exculpatory
as
mr.
harrington
why
approves
them
why
he
went
been
convicted.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
well,
i
think
--
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
well,
i,
in
point
number
one,
i
certainly
agree
there
is
a
marked
difference
between
those
two
statements,
a
very
marked
difference
because
i
think
the
second
statement
is
more
analogous
to
the
federal
harmless
error
rule
namely
if
there
is
an
error,
this
magnitude
in
the
case
did
that
contribute
and
i
think
in
most
all
cases
you
have
to
say,
did
contribute
but
that's
--
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
yes
i
did.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
i'm
aware
of
that,
that's
so-called
state
harmless
error
rule.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
i
quite
agree.
i
think
there
is
a
marked
difference
between
those
two
types
of
analysis.
i
think
the
first
one
is
typical
of
the
state
of
california's
position.
the
latter
one
is
the
federal
harmless
error
rule
which
justice
black
in
the
chapman
case
said
that
when
there
is
a
constitutional
error
of
federal
nature
we
prefer
to
apply
our
federal
harmless
error
rule
to
the
case.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
chief
justice
warren,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
first-degree
murder
case
out
of
the
state
of
california
from
the
city
of
los
angeles
and
my
client
mr.
harrington
according
to
evidence
participated
in
the
robbery
of
a
liquor
store
in
the
city
of
los
angeles
along
with
three
other
codefendants.
the
interesting
thing
about
it
was
the
--
three
of
the
codefendants
were
negro,
mr.
harrington
was
a
caucasian,
and
that
is
a
significant
factor
which
i'll
point
out
as
we
go
along
here
a
little
bit.
the
court
held
the
preliminary
hearing
in
the
case,
according
to
california
procedure,
and
at
the
time
of
the
preliminary
hearing
why
it
showed
quite
conclusively
that
there's
going
to
be
a
lot
of
problems
in
the
way
of
confessions.
it
seems
that
all
three
of
the
other
codefendants
mr.
rhone,
mr.
bosby,
and
mr.
cooper
had
made
confessions
which
implicated
themselves
and
each
other
and
mr.
harrington
in
this
particular
crime.
at
the
time
of
the
trial
setting
in
various
preliminary
motions
counsel
for
mr.
harrington
attempted
to
get
a
severance
of
the
trials
because
of
this
problem
and
at
that
time
he
cited
case
of
delli
paoli
versus
united
states
and
the
jackson
versus
denno
decision
of
this
court
in
an
effort
to
get
these
trials
severed.
these
motions
were
denied
by
the
trial
court.
and
at
various
times
during
the
trial
motions
were
made
to
sever
the
thing
each
time
as
to
harrington
being
denied.
i
think
it
rather
interesting
that
throughout
this
trial,
numerous
pages
were
devoted
to
in-chambers
discussion
between
the
counsel
and
the
court
in
an
effort
to
alter
these
various
confessions
in
such
a
way
that
no
incriminating
statements
were
made
as
to
one
man
versus
the
other.
i
set
that
out
in
my
brief
and
it's
contained
in
the
single
appendix
for
the
court
and
i
think
it's
very
exemplary
of
the
impossibility
in
this
particular
case
that
is
in
most
cases
to
make
a
meaningful
deletion
of
the
names
to
the
point
where
in
this
case
it
became
so
ridiculous
that
the
court
upon
being
accused
by
mr.
harrington's
attorney
at
that
time
of
trying
to
make
the
matter
more
difficult
for
his
counsel
said,
"i'm
going
to
let
all
of
these
confessions
going
in
just
the
way
they
stand
unedited."
now,
mr.
rhone
made
the
confession
which
was
probably
the
most
damaging
and
i
suppose
the
single
possibly
weak
point
in
my
position
here
is
that
mr.
rhone
in
fact
did
take
the
stand
for
cross-examination.
the
other
two
gentlemen,
mr.
cooper
and
mr.
bosby
are
referred
to
mr.
harrington
as
the
white
man,
the
caucasian
and
various
other
terms
never
actually
calling
him
by
name
which
is
a
probably
cause
of
the
fact
that
they
didn't
know
each
other
too
well.
and
so
in
that
particular
sense
neither
one
of
the
other
two
actually
named
mr.
harrington
but
without
a
doubt
because
all
four
of
them
were
being
jointly
tried,
all
four
of
them
setting
at
the
counsel
table
together,
three
negroes
and
the
caucasian
mr.
harrington
coupled
with
mr.
rhone's
confession
actually
naming
mr.
harrington
where
there's
little
doubt
that
in
my
opinion
all
four
these
confessions,
there
are
three
of
the
confessions,
solidified
each
other
and
brought
home
the
inevitable
result
that
took
place
in
this
particular
trial.
now,
it's
my
contention
here
of
course
when
i
filed
the
petition
for
certiorari
of
this
court
it
was
prior
to
the
decision
of
the
court
in
bruton
versus
united
states
and
roberts
versus
russell.
at
the
time
i
filed
petition,
i
was
going
after
a
reversal
of
the
delli
paoli
case
and
so
when
the
court
handed
down
the
bruton
decision,
roberts
versus
russell
decision,
i
anticipated
the
cases
being
remanded
to
the
second
district
court
of
appeals
in
california
with
the
usual
admonition
to
reconsider
the
case
in
a
matter
not
inconsistent
with
this
particular
opinion.
and
so
i
was
elated
to
have
a
chance
come
to
washington
when
the
court
granted
a
hearing
in
the
case.
it's
my
contention
upon
reviewing
all
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
the
prime
one
that
i
hang
my
head
on
is
the
brookhart
versus
janis
case,
384
u.s.
1
decision
by
mr.
justice
black
which
i've
cited
throughout
my
documents
that
i've
filed
that
if
there
was
a
denial
of
confrontation
of
witnesses
without
waiver
why
it
be
a
constitutional
error,
the
first
order
magnitude
and
no
amount
of
prejudice
--
one,
a
prejudice
would
save
this
error
from
the
case.
of
course
in
the
brookhart
case
as
the
court
knows
with
malice
aforethought,
the
confession
of
the
codefendant
was
actually
used
against
mr.
brookhart.
it
was
introduced
for
that
particular
purpose
and
so
the
court
without
hesitation
in
an
eight-man
opinion
by
mr.
justice
black
reversed
that
case
without
recourse
to
any
consideration
of
harmless
error
rule.
in
the
bruton
case
then
if
i
interpret
that
case
correctly
the
court
went
on
to
acknowledge
that
in
its
opinion
it
would
be
impossible
for
a
jury
to
discern
the
difference
between
confession
to
this
type
being
given
by
(a)
with
an
instruction
do
not
consider
against
(b)
only
considered
against
(a)
never
against
(b),
by
mr.
justice
brennan
in
that
case
if
i
add
brookhart
to
bruton,
it's
my
position
in
front
of
this
court
today
that
it
calls
for
an
automatic
reversal
of
this
case
and
all
such
cases
on
a
national
basis
without
recourse
to
any
harmless
error
rules
whatsoever.
now,
in
the
concurring
opinion
by
mr.
justice
stewart
in
chapman
versus
california
there
is
numerous
type
of
errors
at
the
setout
which
call
for
automatic
reversal.
as
i
understand
mr.
justice
stewart
in
that
case
you
took
position
that
no
harmless
error
rule
should
be
applied
at
all
with
these
particular
type
of
errors.
and
as
i
go
through
the
various
types
of
cases
that
this
court
has
passed
judgment
on
the
gideon
versus
wainwright
type
of
denial
at
counsel
reversed
without
recourse
to
a
harmless
error
and
retroactively
so.
the
jackson
versus
denno
case
which
is
a
very
analogous
type
of
error
reversed
without
the
recourse
to
a
harmless
error
rule,
retroactively
so.
in
other
words,
we
have
in
one
hand
as
i
study
the
cases,
the
type
of
errors
that
actually
took
place
during
the
trial
itself
the
denial
of
counsel
at
trial.
the
introduction
of
course
confessions,
this
type
of
thing
which
actually
permeated
at
the
very
trial
itself
as
opposed
to
certain
pretrial
type
of
maneuvers
in
the
way
of
the
miranda
errors
where
the
court
said
that
it's
a
reason
for
reversing
and
not
making
it
retroactive
was
because
of
the
fact
it
wanted
to
discourage
police
conduct
in
this
errors.
the
search
and
seizure
issues
of
course
are
along
the
same
line
but
this
type
of
error
which
we
have
in
front
of
the
court
today;
to
me,
there
can
be
no
question
whatsoever
that
it
has
to
be
resulting
in
a
reversal
without
recourse
to
any
harmless
error
rules
whatsoever.
i
think
based
to
my
own
personal
experience
in
los
angeles
and
trying
some
major
cases
that
i
can
think
of
no
more
severe
error
that
a
defense
counsel
would
have
to
attempt
to
overcome
in
this
particular
one
that
took
place
in
this
case.
i
think
it
alters
entirely
the
defense
of
the
case.
the
state
of
illinois
in
its
amicus
curiae
brief
pointed
out
that
after
all
mr.
harrington
did
no
more
than
what
the
state
of
california
to
its
test
to
see
if
it
had
enough
evidence
to
convict
him,
he
did
not
take
the
stand.
he
put
on
next
to
no
defense
whatsoever
and
i
simply
contend
and
point
out
to
the
court
that
in
my
opinion
when
a
magnitudinal
error
such
as
three
confessions
were
introduced
against
him.
the
entire
strategy
of
the
case
would
change.
he
was
--
i
must
admit
a
previous
loser.
he'd
been
doing
time
up
in
san
quentin
for
previous
crimes.
he
therefore
had
the
problem
that
he
would
be
impeached
as
a
witness
by
previous
convictions
of
a
felony
and
so
the
counsel
at
that
time
apparently
elected
to
not
put
him
on
the
stand
and
so
forth.
therefore,
i
contend
the
entire
strategy
of
the
trial
is
altered
by
this
particular
difficulty
and
it's
impossible
for
any
reviewing
court
to
say
with
any
certainty
that
harmless
error
did
not
take
place
if
the
court
is
constrained
to
even
apply
harmless
error
rule
to
it.
the
--
this
court
of
course
is
considered
in
analogous
situation
in
the
barber
versus
page
case
of
the
past
term
where
the
preliminary
hearing
testimony
was
introduced
at
the
trial
without
making
an
effort
to
get
the
witness
in
front
of
the
court.
again,
the
reversal
without
recourse
to
harmless
error
rules
and
in
the
recent
case
of
berger
versus
california,
the
court
made
it
again
retroactive.
and
i
can
only
conclude
that
this
court
did
the
requisite
amount
of
soul
searching
during
the
deliberations
in
chambers
as
to
the
magnitude
of
this
particular
error.
i
don't
think
the
court
would
make
an
error
of
this
magnitude
retroactive
and
unless
it
considered
it
to
be
a
severe
one,
tremendously
severe
one.
and
it's
my
contention
that
because
of
this
severity
of
this
error,
it
is
not
at
all
applicable
to
any
type
of
harmless
error
rules
that
must
be
reversed
per
se
throughout
the
nation
when
this
type
of
thing
takes
place.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
no,
your
honor
he
did
not.
harrington
did
not
take
the
stand.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
mr.
rhone
took
the
stand.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
no,
actually
we
don't.
now,
on
california
--
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
that's
correct.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
no
question
about
it.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
apparently
not,
had
he
taken
the
stand
and
he
being
the
only
codefendant
apparently
we
wouldn't
have
the
bruton
problem
but
as
i
read
the
sixth
amendment
it
says
you
have
a
right
to
be
confronted
by
all
the
witnesses.
and
i
guess
it
didn't
--
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
no
actually
not,
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
probably
were
not
near
as
damaging
for
the
reason
i
didn't
name
him
per
se
like
mr.
rhone
did.
mr.
rhone
--
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
well,
that's
a
good
question.
i
contend
that
relying
on
the
sixth
amendment
--
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
it
has
to
--
has
to
be
the
all
the
witnesses.
i
can't
see
how
you
can
bifurcate
the
thing,
he
might
have
49
witnesses
who
didn't
take
the
stand
and
one
that
did.
and
it's
just
inconceivable
to
me
that
you
can
split
hairs
on
the
numbers
that
did
and
the
numbers
that
did
not.
this
was
a
very
severe
type
of
case
which
--
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
well,
did
not
name
and
explicitly
it's
referred
to
him
as
the
white
man,
the
caucasian,
the
paddy
and
things
of
this
nature
in
such
a
way
that
with
all
four
of
them,
sent
them
to
witness
table.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
there's
a
little
doubt
about
it
in
my
opinion.
i
remind
the
court
also
of
the
recent
decision
of
smith
versus
illinois
which
was
as
i
recall
the
major
issue
that
confronted
the
court
was
whether
the
question
of
a
witness
as
to
what
your
address
is
and
he
did
not
answer
before
the
answer
came
in.
the
court
sustained
an
objection
in
answering
that
question.
this
court
reversed
again
summarily
without
recourse
to
any
harmless
error
rules
with
the
simple
defect
as
i
understand
it
of
no
response
to
the
question
where
he
lives.
and
it
was
held
in
citing
again
with
the
approval
of
brookhart
versus
janis
case
that
if
there's
a
denial
of
confrontation
of
witnesses,
it
is
a
constitutional
error
the
first
order
magnitude
and
no
want
of
the
prejudice
will
save
it.
i
simply
--
in
reading
that
case,
to
which
eight
members
of
this
court
i
think
mr.
justice
marshall
was
not
on
the
order
at
the
time
he
did
not
participate
but
apparently
members
of
this
court
signed
their
name
to
it
subscribing
a
cent
to
the
words
of
mr.
justice
black
in
the
brookhart
versus
janis
case
that
this
type
of
thing
would
not
be
subject
to
any
type
of
harmless
error
rule.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
yes,
every
confession
is
in
the
record.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
well,
i
pointed
it
out;
i
did
not
index
my
copy
of
the
single
appendix.
mr.
cooper's
statement
begins
at
page
198
of
the
single
appendix.
mr.
bosby's
confession
is
on
273
of
the
single
appendix.
further
confession
by
cooper
on
page
321
of
the
single
appendix
and
mr.
rhone's
statements
397
of
the
single
appendix.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
and
so
forth.
there,
they're
spread
throughout
it.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
yes
i
am
and
by
enlarge,
i
might
move
on
to
that.
by
enlarge
the
chief
evidence
against
mr.
harrington
was
other
than
the
confession
was
a
couple
of
people
who
worked
in
the
store
who
fortunately
lived
to
tell
about
it.
the
proprietor
of
the
store
was
a
woman
and
another
male
clerk
was
in
the
store.
the
interesting
thing
about
it
was
when
these
people
reported
the
crime
and
made
their
statements
to
the
police,
the
man
without
hesitation
admitted
that
he
said
four
negroes
carried
this
crime
out.
the
woman
equivocated
somewhat
but
also
admitted
that
she
had
told
the
police
that
in
her
opinion
four
negroes
had
carried
the
crime
out.
it's
therefore
my
contention
that
an
astute
attorney
in
the
defense
of
these
gentlemen
at
least
in
defense
of
mr.
harrington,
absent
the
various
errors
that
have
occurred
in
this
case
which
certainly
have
a
fighting
chance
for
an
acquittal
in
the
case
because
if
they
cannot
tell
the
difference
between
caucasian
versus
negro,
well
perhaps
other
evidence
that
they
testified
to
would
be
much
weaker
also.
i
would
ask
the
court
to
in
its
opinion
attempt
to
spell
out
with
very
specificity
this
bruton,
roberts
versus
russell
error
that
has
been
one
that
has
hang
around
for
many,
many
years.
i'm
confident
if
the
court
does
not
spell
it
out
in
such
a
way
that
there
can
be
little
doubt
as
to
what
the
court
means.
the
court
is
going
to
be
inundated
with
petitions
for
certiorari
for
the
next
decade.
i
think
the
case
it
would
just
proceeded
this
one
banks
versus
california
is
the
excellent
example
of
the
fact
that
the
griffin
rule
was
apparently
still
being
emasculated
by
the
various
lower
level
courts
around
the
nation
and
to
me,
they
are
just
as
--
is
no
question
that
it
must
be
subjected
to
reversibility
per
se
if
the
brookhart
versus
janis
opinion
is
interpreted
correctly
by
myself.
i
just
can't
believe
that
this
type
of
error
has
any
different
in
the
gideon
versus
wainwright
error
if
i
look
at
the
sixth
amendment
and
read
it
i
see
the
right
of
counsel
and
the
right
to
confront
witnesses
in
the
same
paragraph.
i
could
read
that
short
portion
of
it.
i
would
assure
that
it's
more
familiar
to
the
court
than
myself
and
i
did
bring
along
with
it
because
i
saw
the
television
show
in
mr.
justice
black's
birthday
a
few
months
ago
where
you
referred
to
the
copy
of
the
constitution
that
you
carried
with
you.
and
so
i
had
it
along
with
me
in
case
i
had
to
refer
to
it
but
i
think
that
if
the
court
will
check
the
sixth
amendment,
it
goes
to
types
of
rights
are
set
forth
right
beside
each
other
in
the
sixth
amendment.
i
can't
see
that
they
can
therefore
be
distinguished
that
the
gideon
versus
wainwright
case
given
total
retroactivity
was
no
application
of
harmless
error
rules
so
must
the
error
in
the
harrington
case,
bruton
versus
united
states,
roberts
versus
russell,
must
likewise
be
given
reversal
without
recourse
to
any
harmless
error
rules
just
impossible
to
calculate
the
impact
of
this
type
of
thing
and
i
think
that
you
actually
have
to
get
in
and
--
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
that's
the
griffin
error.
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
i
do.
i
contend
that
it
stands
exactly
along
where
the
gideon
versus
wainwright
type
of
error
and
--
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
well,
--
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
well,
i
think
that's
--
i
think
one
that
is
of
the
same
magnitude,
it
has
so
been
held
--
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
well,
you
mean
the
miranda
type
error?
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
well,
the
course
--
no,
there's
no
harmless
error
in
coerced
confessions.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
well,
i
--
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
well,
i
read
your
majority
opinion
in
jackson
versus
denno
and
i
found
it
difficult
to
believe
you
could
dissent
in
the
bruton
case
the
way
you
did
but
perhaps
that's
because
i'm
not
a
student
after
disserting
the
differences.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
yes
i
know
and
i
contend
that's
much
more
damaging.
i
think
the
confession
of
a
man
himself
is
a
much
more
reliable
index
than
the
confession
of
the
codefendant
because
i
tried
the
case
--
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
well,
i
tried
the
case
in
los
angeles.
you
probably
will
hear
more
about
it,
it
involves
the
man
the
name
of
robert
massie
who
contends
that
he
has
a
right
to
be
executed
and
i
think
that
justice
douglas
stated
the
execution
here
a
few
weeks
ago
but
he
is
now
in
san
quentin,
he
contends
he
has
a
right
to
be
executed
and
the
supreme
court
of
california,
i
guess,
agrees
with
him
because
they
have
gone
along
with.
his
petitions
do
not
have
any
attorneys
representing
him
and
things
like
these.
but
i
tried
that
case
with
the
bruton
error
in
it,
i
mean
after
bruton
error
was
reversed
and
i
got
an
acquittal
of
this
man
and
of
his
codefendant
mr.
john
vater
(ph)
and
i
think
that
the
court,
anyone
that
has
to
check
the
impact
of
this
type
of
thing
get
in
and
try
it
one
time
and
it's
an
insurmountable
thing
when
the
codefendant
makes
a
confession
because
i
think
that
people
that
sit
on
the
jury
will
say
rightfully
so
that
only
somebody
with
a
work
mind
would
accuse
somebody.
but
in
the
massie
case,
very
clear
mr.
massie
came
down
the
second
time
testified
that
he
had
accused
mr.
vater
(ph)
this
crime
simply
because
he
got
mad
at
him
but
he
actually
was
not
with
him
just
because
he
got
mad
at
him.
in
this
particular
case,
the
inference
is
of
course
he
lied
about
it.
but
i
don't
think
a
confession
by
somebody
himself
would
be
subject
to
that
same
type
of
attack.
if
i
confess
that
i
committed
a
murder,
i
think
that's
a
pretty
reliable
index
of
guilt,
quite
reliable
as
opposed
to
my
accusing
somebody
else
and
sustaining
the
conviction
of
somebody
else
my
testimony
without
my
getting
on
the
stand
for
cross-examination.
i
still
have
difficulty
--
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
that's
what
i
contend
and
yet
jackson
versus
denno
this
was
reversed
per
se.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
and
you
feel
that's
not
the
same
difficulty?
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
i
read
that
but
i
still
don't
--
i
don't
understand
it.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
i'm
sure
that's
correct.
well,
i
already
referred
to
my
opponent
at
this
time
and
save
the
remaining
amount
of
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
chief
justice
warren,
may
it
please
the
court.
as
far
as
the
retroactivity
facts
of
this
case
go,
i'm
sure
this
court
has
pondered
that
time
and
time
again
in
its
decision
on
barber
versus
page
and
berger
versus
california.
i
feel
that
the
damage
that
is
going
to
take
place
in
this
nation
has
already
taking
place
by
the
judgment
of
retroactivity
by
this
court.
it's
my
contention
that
if
we're
going
to
have
a
minimum
of
litigation
in
this
country
at
appellate
level,
the
only
way
that
that
can
really
be
taking
care
of
is
a
reversibility
per
se
because
if
a
court
honestly,
honestly
applies
the
federal
harmless
error
rule
which
i
think
is
the
very
minimal
that
is
going
to
come
out
of
this
discussion
today.
if
it
honestly
applies
it,
it
has
to
declare
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt
that
the
error
complain
of
did
not
contribute
to
the
conviction.
and
i
simply
say
that
in
999
cases
out
of
a
hundred
or
out
of
a
thousand,
i
just
find
it
inconceivable
to
believe
that
if
a
court
honestly
applying
that
--
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
well,
i
simply
--
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
well,
in
the
chapman
decision,
the
court
says
purged
mr.
justice
black
we
prefer
the
approach
of
this
court
deciding
what
was
harmless
error
in
our
recent
case
of
fahy
versus
connecticut.
there,
we
said,
"the
question
is
whether
there
was
a
reasonable
possibility
that
the
evidence
complained
of
might
have
contributed
to
the
conviction"
and
a
little
bit
later
justice
black
says,
there
is
little
if
any
difference
between
our
statement
and
fahy
versus
connecticut
about
"whether
there
was
a
reasonable
possibility
that
the
evidence
complained
of
might
have
contributed
to
the
conviction"
in
requiring
the
beneficiary
of
the
constitutional
error
to
prove
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
the
error
complain
of
did
not
contribute
to
the
verdict
obtained.
and
that
would
seem
to
me
that
if
--
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
well,
i
think
it's
indulging
in
the
type
of
analysis
that
mr.
justice
harlan
commented
on
a
little
bit
ago
attempting
to
second
guess
lay
jury.
i
think
it's
dangerous
and
i
also
think
that
any
court
honestly
applying
that
federal
harmless
error
rule
cannot
come
to
any
other
conclusion
that
a
majority
of
this
case
is
must
reversed.
and
i
know
from
experience
in
california
that
the
lower
courts
out
there
are
not
going
to
do
it
because
you're
too
close
to
the
ball
game
out
there.
there's
been
crimes
have
been
committed
in
the
state,
the
people
are
in
sense
about
it,
you
have
to
take
him
to
washington
where
we
have
nine
men
that
take
a
little
distant
viewpoint
of
these
things
and
analyze
them
on
the
basis
of
what
has
been
promulgated
by
this
court
heretofore.
and
i
think
it's
very
clear
that
the
federal
harmless
error
rules
are
very
minimal
thing
that's
going
to
be
applied
to
this
case
if
it
is
applied
to
all
and
i
contend
this
court
really
is
not
going
to
apply
it.
i
think
that
if
the
court
applies
in
brookhart
versus
janis
case
with
the
bruton
case
--
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
well,
perhaps
there
is
no
great
difference.
i
gathered
mr.
justice
harlan
felt
that
might
be
some
problem
in
attempting
to
for
a
court
to
say
to
a
--
to
put
itself
in
the
position
of
a
jury
and
say,
do
we
as
the
court
think
that
this
jury
would've
come
up
with
difference.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
well,
--
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
well,
there's
a
little
doubt
in
my
mind
that
jurors
can't
tell
the
difference
in
this
error
because
our
supreme
court
in
california
has
exceeded
that
even
further
than
that.
they
have
granted
the
fact
that
even
judges
can't
tell
it.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
well,
i
agree
that's
the
problem
i
think
that
if
the
court
will
not
apply
harmless
error
we
don't
have
the
problem.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
well,
i
just
can't
believe
that
an
error
of
this
magnitude
can
ever
be
said
noncontributory.
i
just
can't
believe
that
it
can
be
done.
it's
beyond
my
concept.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
yes.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
well,
i
don't
agree
with
that
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
well,
they
certainly
did
by
describing
very
well
--
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
well,
i'm
aware
of
that
but
if
that
argument
holds
any
water
then
they
must
have
convicted
him
on
something
else
beside
those
statements
because
if
the
statements
were
to
be
believed
that
they
were
exculpatory
as
mr.
harrington
why
approves
them
why
he
went
been
convicted.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
well,
i
think
--
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
well,
i,
in
point
number
one,
i
certainly
agree
there
is
a
marked
difference
between
those
two
statements,
a
very
marked
difference
because
i
think
the
second
statement
is
more
analogous
to
the
federal
harmless
error
rule
namely
if
there
is
an
error,
this
magnitude
in
the
case
did
that
contribute
and
i
think
in
most
all
cases
you
have
to
say,
did
contribute
but
that's
--
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
yes
i
did.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
i'm
aware
of
that,
that's
so-called
state
harmless
error
rule.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
i
quite
agree.
i
think
there
is
a
marked
difference
between
those
two
types
of
analysis.
i
think
the
first
one
is
typical
of
the
state
of
california's
position.
the
latter
one
is
the
federal
harmless
error
rule
which
justice
black
in
the
chapman
case
said
that
when
there
is
a
constitutional
error
of
federal
nature
we
prefer
to
apply
our
federal
harmless
error
rule
to
the
case.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
thank
you,
your
honor.
