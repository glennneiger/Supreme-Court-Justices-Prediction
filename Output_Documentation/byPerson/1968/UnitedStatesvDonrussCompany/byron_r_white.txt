justice

r.
white
is
this
true
mr.
rogovin
even
though
you're
not
relying
on
the
presumption?
let's
assume
there's
some
expressed
approval
of
what
the
purpose
was.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
is
was
to
avoid
income
taxes.
justice
byron
r.
white
then
as
long
as
the
accumulation
is
reasonable,
there's
no
penalty
imposed.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
this
in
effect
that
this
law
unreasonable
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
is
just
denounced
to
a
law
against
unreasonable
purpose
in
accumulation?
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
the
intent
still
maintain
--
still
accumulate
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
your
ability
to
make
it
stick
would
be
able
to
--
would
depend
on
your
ability
to
prove
that
the
accumulation
was
unreasonable,
would
it
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
assume
that
the
service
would
move
against
any
corporation
that
it
had
what
it
thought
objectively
was
an
unreasonable
accumulation.
justice
byron
r.
white
excuse
me.
just
to
help
me
a
little
bit.
is
the
issue
here
really
whether
the
government
was
proved
the
purpose
or
only
one
of
several
purposes?
is
that
the
real
issue
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
taxpayer
but
it
seems
to
me
if
the
taxpayer
could
prove
that
there
was
a
reasonable
purpose,
he
is
off
--
he
certainly
doesn't
pay
any
tax,
does
he?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
--
so
that
even
if
there
was
also
the
purpose
of
avoiding
taxes,
he
would
still
win?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
he
doesn't
have
to
prove
that
it's
the
--
all
he
has
to
prove
--
he
does
avoid
additional
tax
such
by
approving
one
other
purpose
besides
avoiding.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
decide
it's
unreasonable
that
they
really
decided
that
there
is
no
other
purpose
other
than
to
avoid
tax.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
taxpayer
would
win?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
there
isn't
any
other
reason
for
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
not
only
attempted
but
it
enacted
many,
many
laws,
the
personal
holding
company
law.
it
attempted
and
succeeded.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
a
valid
reason?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
to
succeed
don't
you
have
to
say
that
even
--
that
the
taxpayer
may
succeed
even
though
the
reason
he
has
isn't
a
very
good
reason
and
even
though,
even
though
he
can't
prove
that
the
accumulation
is
reasonable
in
terms
of
business
need.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
that
avoidance
is
the
purpose.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
this
really
isn't
a
case
about
whether
you
need
one
or
several
purposes?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it's
only
their
position
against
the
background
of
a
finding
that
the
accumulation
was
and
serves
that
frame
of
reference
and
by
objective
standards
and
unreasonable
accumulation.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
in
--
you
mean
the
jury
wouldn't
have
to
find
that
there
was
an
unreasonable
accumulation?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
what
i
mean.
justice
byron
r.
white
before
you
--
before
the
taxpayer
goes
out
the
window
in
the
government's
position
it
has
to
be
bound
of
the
accumulation
were
unreasonable.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
once
it's
found
that
the
reasonable
objectively
there
is
a
no
reason
in
terms
of
the
needs
of
the
business
or
to
the
extent
that
it's
unreasonable?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
do
concede
that
if
it's
necessary
to
find
that
the
accumulation
was
unreasonable?
justice
byron
r.
white
then
what
the
taxpayer
is
claiming
as
justification
for
this
accumulation
has
been
turned
to
be
unreasonable
and
he
is
giving
an
unreasonable
reason
for
the
accumulation.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it
maybe
that
that
is
a
matter
of
subjective
and
then
he
thought
that
he
needed
this
much
money
for
that
purpose
and
you
say
that
that's
subjective
attitude
should
be
some
room
for
that.
is
there
room
for
you
to
prove
that
it
in
the
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
weren't
though?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
the
court,
if
a
judge
or
jury
found
the
accumulation
of
the
unreasonable
by
whatever
applicable
standards
there
were
you're
suggestion
is
that
nevertheless
a
taxpayer
should
be
allowed
not
to
be
taxed
on
the
unreasonable
accumulation
because
he
had
a
good
faith
view
that
this
was
--
that
his
business
needed
these
accumulation?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
the
--
i
think
the
jury
is
structured
to
(inaudible)
--
i
think
it's
a
matter
of
actual
(inaudible)
the
jury
is
saying,
“well,
it's
not
unreasonable
accumulation
here”
but
nevertheless
the
taxpayer
still
wins
because
he
had
a
--
he
just
made
a
mistake.
do
you
think
it's
a
--
how
is
your
experience
with
the
jury
if
the
judge
going
to
be
against
that
finding?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
it
is
an
unreasonable?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
how
is
that
--
how
offer
you're
going
to
--
i'm
just
wondering
how
significant
this
whole
argument
is,
what's
that
last
refuge
worth
once
the
finding
about
reasonableness
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
gather
the
government
would
think
so
to
or
it
would
be
(voice
overlap).
justice
byron
r.
white
i
guess
what
it
means
is
that
there
probably
would
be
more
trials,
more
efforts
to
--
the
necessity
of
making
more
settlements?
