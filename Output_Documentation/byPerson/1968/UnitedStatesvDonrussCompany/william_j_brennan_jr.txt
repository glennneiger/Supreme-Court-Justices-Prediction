justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
let's
see
if
i
get
you
mr.
rogovin.
they
showed
$200,000.00
accumulation.
the
reasonable
need
to
the
business
is
concluded
are
$100,000.00.
to
that
extent
is
the
credit,
is
that
what
you
just
said?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes
and
the
tax
would
be
assessed
on
against
the
other
$100,000.00
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
suppose
you
had
a
case
where
in
fact
the
accumulation
is
again
$100,000.00,
but
you
know
that
the
only
purpose
of
the
accumulation
was,
well,
not
the
only
purpose
but
the
primary
purpose
was
tax
avoidance.
yet
they
also
introduced
evidence
that
no
they
had
a
business
need
and
a
$100,000.00
is
reasonable,
again,
the
$100,000.00
be
credited,
wouldn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
there
will
be
no
tax
in
that
situation.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
don't
understand
as
to
how
that
comes
down
to
anything
except
as
the
hypothetical
as
i
suggested
to
you.
except
that
if
it's
established
that
in
so
far
as
the
accumulation
is
related
to
the
reasonable
needs
of
the
business,
there's
no
tax,
any
excess
there's
a
tax,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know
but
the
presumption
is
not
rebutted
in
the
situation
that
you
choose.
if
all
you
establish
is
that
in
so
far
as
“x”
dollars
are
concerned,
that's
related
to
the
reasonable
needs
of
the
business
period
then
you
pay
a
tax
on
the
excess
of
that.
