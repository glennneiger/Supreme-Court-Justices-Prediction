mr.
mitchell
rogovin
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
income
tax
case
dealing
with
the
construction
or
portion
of
the
accumulated
earnings
tax.
the
purpose
of
this
tax,
the
accumulated
earnings
tax,
which
has
been
a
part
of
our
tax
fabrics
since
1913,
is
to
deter
shareholders
of
a
corporation
from
avoiding
individual
income
tax
by
having
the
corporation
accumulate
earnings
beyond
the
reasonable
needs
of
the
corporation.
the
government's
petition
for
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
review
the
judgment
of
the
sixth
circuit
in
this
case
takes
place
because
the
sixth
circuit's
decision
was
in
conflict
with
four
other
circuits,
circuits
that
are
in
support
of
the
united
states
in
its
construction.
the
surplus
earnings
tax
deals
with
sections
531
through
537
of
the
internal
revenue
code
and
they
have
three
essential
features.
section
532
(a)
of
the
code
has
the
critical
operative
provision
in
the
context
of
the
accumulated
earnings
tax.
this
is
the
provision
that
imposes
the
special
tax
on
“every
corporation
formed
or
availed
of
for
the
purpose
of
avoiding
the
income
tax
with
respect
to
its
shareholders
by
permitting
earnings
and
profits
to
accumulate
instead
of
being
divided
or
distributed.”
this
feature
requires
a
particular
showing
of
conduct
and
a
particular
showing
of
a
state
of
mind.
questions
of
intent
and
state
of
mind
however
are
difficult
and
since
1913,
the
statute
has
carried
with
it
a
rebuttable
presumption
regarding
the
prohibited
purpose.
section
533
(a)
of
the
code
carries
the
prohibited
--
carries
this
presumption.
it
provides
that
the
fact
that
earnings
and
profits
are
permitted
to
accumulate
beyond
the
reasonable
needs
of
the
business
shall
be
determinative
of
the
purpose
to
avoid
the
income
tax
with
respect
to
shareholders
unless
the
corporation
by
the
preponderance
of
the
evidence
shall
prove
to
the
contrary.
finally,
since
1954,
there
has
been
a
credit
provision
within
the
accumulated
earnings
tax
and
this
is
found
at
535
(c),
the
most
significant
of
the
two
credits,
the
535
(c)
(1)
credit
which
in
essence
permits
a
credit
notwithstanding
the
presence
of
this
proscribed
purpose.
as
to
that
portion
of
the
accumulated
earnings
that
if
determined
by
the
trier
of
fact
to
be
reasonable,
although
the
ultimate
issue
is
whether
or
not
there's
a
proscribed
purpose,
whether
or
not
it
exists,
even
if
it's
found
to
exist,
the
credit
under
535
(c)
(1)
would
wash
out
the
tax
at
least
as
to
that
portion
of
the
accumulation
--
mr.
mitchell
rogovin
yes,
sir.
mr.
mitchell
rogovin
yes,
sir.
mr.
mitchell
rogovin
yes,
mr.
justice
white,
what
had
happened
prior
to
1954
was
that
if
there
are
any
portion
of
the
total
accumulation
were
determined
to
be
unreasonable,
then
the
tax
would
apply
to
the
totality
of
the
accumulation.
the
credit
in
1954
allowed
the
taxpayer
to
at
least
take
out
of
the
ambit
of
a
tax
that
portion
which
was
determined
to
be
reasonable
at
all
times
assuming
that
the
avoidance
purpose
existed.
mr.
mitchell
rogovin
pardon
me
sir.
mr.
mitchell
rogovin
with
the
requisite
of
intent.
the
intent
is
built
into
the
statute,
the
central
feature.
mr.
mitchell
rogovin
as
the
net
result
of
the
'54
credit.
to
summarize,
the
special
tax
will
imposed
if
the
purpose
of
avoiding
the
shareholder
tax
is
found
to
exists
either
because
of
the
presumption
in
533
(a)
or
if
it's
found
independently
of
it
but
subject
to
the
credit
for
so
much
of
the
retained
earnings
as
reasonably
needed
for
the
business.
now,
the
present
case
takes
the
form
of
a
suit
for
refund.
at
the
trial,
the
jury
heard
that
evidence
that
for
the
years
1960
and
1961,
the
respondent,
a
bubblegum
manufacturer
had
increased
the
accumulated
earnings
in
those
years
in
suit
from
approximately
1,638,000
to
1,679,000.
there
was
no
record
of
any
dividends
ever
being
paid
in
the
years
in
suit
or
any
indication
of
dividends
having
been
paid
since
the
inception
of
a
corporation
on
1947.
the
sole
stockholder
testified
that
the
reasons
for
the
accumulations
were
to
purchase
the
stock
of
respondent's
major
distributor.
there
was
also
a
testimony
that
the
accumulations
were
because
of
a
fear
of
depression,
possible
fear
of
war
and
also
a
desire
on
the
part
of
the
respondent
to
follow
by
expansion
the
footsteps
of
the
wrigley
company.
now,
in
response
to
interrogatories,
the
jury
found:
one,
that
during
the
years
in
suit,
the
respondent
had
accumulated
its
earnings
beyond
the
reasonable
or
reasonably
anticipated
needs
of
a
business
but
that
it
had
not
retained
its
earnings
for
the
purpose
of
avoiding
the
income
on
its
sole
shareholder.
the
government's
appeal
was
based
on
the
district
court's
refusal
to
define
the
phrase
“the
purpose”
as
it
relates
to
the
reason
for
the
retention
of
the
earnings.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
and
remanded
the
case
for
a
new
trial
holding
that
the
jury
might
well
have
been
led
to
believe
that
tax
avoidance
must
be
the
sole
purpose
behind
an
accumulation.
now,
this
position,
the
tax
avoidance
must
be
the
sole
purpose
and
not
been
asserted
by
either
of
the
parties.
the
sixth
circuit
in
reaching
this
decision
rejected
the
government's
position,
the
government's
request
for
a
jury
instruction
that
tax
avoidance
need
only
be
one
of
the
purposes
for
the
company's
accumulation
policy
and
the
sixth
circuit
went
on
to
hold
that
the
jury
should
be
instructed
that
the
accumulated
earnings
tax
applies
only
if
tax
avoidance
was
the
dominant,
controlling
or
impelling
motive.
the
government
seeks
to
review
in
this
court
because
we
believe
that
this
dominant
purpose
standard
is
erroneous.
we
believe
that
the
proper
view
was
the
view
that
was
requested
of
the
district
court,
that
tax
avoidance
need
only
be
one
of
the
purposes
of
an
accumulation
for
the
special
tax
to
come
into
play.
the
basic
purpose
of
sections
531
through
537
is
to
discourage
the
use
of
a
corporation
as
a
repository
for
accumulations.
accumulations
which
if
distributed
would
have
been
taxed
at
the
progressive
rates
upon
the
individual
shareholders
since
corporations
have
a
legal
existence
apart
from
that
of
the
individual
taxpayers
and
shareholders,
the
corporation
can
be
interposed
between
the
source
of
income
and
the
receipt
by
the
individual
owner,
thus
allowing
the
beneficial
owner
to
avoid
the
personal
income
tax,
the
tax
of
graduated
rates.
this
avoidance
device
has
been
recognized
by
congress
since
the
inception
of
the
modern
income
tax
in
1913
and
sections
531
through
537
are
an
effort,
a
statutory
effort
to
overcome
the
fact
that
we
do
not
have
integration
between
the
income
tax
and
the
corporate
tax.
the
purpose
of
the
accumulated
earnings
tax
is
as
this
court
had
concluded
in
helvering
v.
stock
yards,
318
u.s.
693
at
page
979,
“to
compel
the
company
to
distribute
any
profits
not
needed
for
the
conduct
of
its
business
so
that
when
so
distributed,
individual
shareholders
will
become
liable.”
underlying
this
--
underlying
the
statute
is
a
legislative
assumption
that
it
becomes
a
misuse
of
a
corporation
if
its
profits
are
retained
for
the
purpose
of
avoiding
the
stockholder's
individual
income
tax.
judge
learned
hand
in
united
business
corp.
62
f.2d
754
at
756
said
as
to
the
accumulated
earnings
tax,
“companies
may
accumulate
what
profits
they
please
so
long
as
they
do
not
defeat
the
fiscal
policies
of
the
united
states.
their
business
does
not
include
the
manipulation
of
dividends
to
avoid
taxes
by
definition
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
normal
management
of
their
affairs.”
now,
the
critical
language
in
this
provision
is
the
language
in
532
availed
of
for
the
purpose
of
avoiding
the
income
tax.
and
in
no
way
does
this
language
import
any
qualification
such
as
formulated
by
the
sixth
circuit
that
this
tax
avoidance
must
be
the
dominant
purpose
among
many
purposes.
availed
of
simply
means
used
to
the
extent
tax
avoidance
induces
or
aids
in
inducing
in
the
retention
of
accumulated
earnings.
the
corporation
has
been
used
or
in
the
statutory
language
“availed
of”
for
this
prohibited
purpose.
now,
the
government's
position
is
derived
from
the
plain
statutory
language
that
implies
no
further
qualification
and
also
from
this
court's
interpretation
of
that
statutory
language
in
the
stock
yards
case.
we
thought
as
did
four
circuits
that
this
issue
had
been
made
to
rest.
and
the
stock
yards
case,
the
first
circuit,
the
taxpayer
argued
that
the
accumulation
policy
of
the
corporation
was
intended
to
satisfy
the
debts
of
a
new
jersey
subsidiary
upon
its
contemplated
liquidation
in
1940.
now,
this
plan
had
been
inaugurated
prior
to
the
adoption
of
the
sixteenth
amendment
and
consistently
followed
by
the
corporation
thereafter,
so
that
argued
the
taxpayer,
the
corporation
could
not
have
been
availed
of
for
the
proscribed
purpose
that
out
in
the
law.
and
this
was
their
position
as
a
matter
of
law.
now,
although
the
first
circuit
reversed
the
board
of
tax
appeals
which
had
upheld
the
assertion
of
the
accumulated
tax.
the
first
circuit
rejected
the
taxpayer's
argument.
the
first
circuit
in
chicago
stock
yards
at
129
f.2d.937
at
page
948
said,
“it
is
clear
that
section
104
would
apply
if
in
the
totality
of
reason
which
induced
the
continuing
of
the
accumulation,
the
forbidden
motive
of
surtax
avoidance
played
a
substantial
part.”
the
first
circuit
thus
rejected
the
concept
of
a
dominant
purpose
theory.
it
was
in
this
context
that
the
case
came
to
this
court
and
this
court
stated
at
page
699,
“a
corporate
practice
adopted
for
the
mere
convenience
above
or
for
other
reasons
and
without
tax
significance
when
adopted
may
have
been
continued
with
the
additional
motive
of
avoiding
surtax
on
the
sharehold
--
stockholders.
the
board's
conclusion,
that
is
the
conclusion
of
the
board
of
tax
appeals
that
the
accumulated
earnings
tax
was
to
impose,
may
justifiably
have
been
reached
in
the
view
that
whatever
the
motive
when
the
practice
of
accumulation
was
adopted,
the
purpose
of
avoiding
surtax
induced
or
aided
in
inducing,
the
continuance
of
the
practice.”
mr.
mitchell
rogovin
this
is
in
the
stock
yards
case
mr.
justice
black,
318
u.s.
at
page
699.
mr.
mitchell
rogovin
i
believe
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
mitchell
rogovin
well,
it's
two-part
test.
the
objective
part
of
the
test
has
not
been
considered
in
your
hypothetical
and
that
is
--
are
the
accumulations
unreasonable
or
the
funds
retained
for
the
purpose
of
avoiding
the
surtax
on
individuals?
mr.
mitchell
rogovin
i
believe
the
track
record
of
the
revenue
service
in
this
regard
tends
to
indicate
that
they
are
looking
at
a
small,
closely
held
corporation.
mr.
mitchell
rogovin
the
concern
of
the
congress
in
passing
the
accumulated
earnings
tax
was
a
concern
that
the
stockholders
could
so
manipulate
the
corporation
and
thereby
require
or
cause
the
corporation
to
retain
earnings,
earnings
that
would
not
be
passed
on
to
the
stockholders.
mr.
mitchell
rogovin
well,
that's
a
presumption
that
the
congress
indulged
in,
in
assuming
that
there's
close
relation
between
stockholders
and
corporation
could
cause
this
result
and
that
there
would
be
no
objective
evidence
to
demonstrate
tax
avoidance
and
so
the
presumption
was
built
into
the
statute.
mr.
mitchell
rogovin
no
theoretically,
it
could
be
applicable
to
a
large
listed
corporation,
if
the
listed
corporation
mr.
justice
fortas
at
the
liquid
assets
and
the
accumulated
cash
in
an
unreasonable
posture
for
the
states
--
mr.
mitchell
rogovin
i
believe
that
it
had
been
applied
in
one
case.
mr.
mitchell
rogovin
trico
to
a
1500
stockholders.
mr.
mitchell
rogovin
that's
about
the
largest,
yes
sir.
mr.
mitchell
rogovin
technically
it
would
open
it
up
to
--
technically
we
have
construed
--
we
were
construing
it
as
it
has
always
been
construed.
to
respond
to
your
question,
however,
i
feel
the
question
of
the
nature
of
the
accumulation
would
differ
substantially
than
the
large
corporation.
mr.
mitchell
rogovin
i
believe
the
pressures
of
large
listed
corporations,
the
stockholder
pressures
are
such
that
large
amounts
of
liquid
assets
not
being
applied
for
the
purposes
of
the
corporation
would
generate
better
management
if
not
dividends.
mr.
mitchell
rogovin
i
have
no
answer
to
that
question
mr.
chief
justice.
i
believe
that
clearly,
the
--
mr.
mitchell
rogovin
it
does
exist
and
that's
what
congress
was
concerned
about
in
the
main
and
has
been
expressed
this
concern
throughout
the
reenactments
of
the
statutes
since
1913
but
there
has
been
no
indication
that
the
statute
would
not
apply
to
a
large
corporation
if
the
factual
pattern
so
existed.
i
don't
think
the
revenue
service
is
binding
itself
that
it
would
not
go
order
a
large
corporation
and
raise
this
issue
if
it
existed.
but
the
facts
just
don't
support
it
in
the
large
corporations.
mr.
mitchell
rogovin
yes
sir,
that's
correct.
mr.
mitchell
rogovin
right.
mr.
mitchell
rogovin
the
distributor,
yes.
mr.
mitchell
rogovin
this
was
a
solely
owned
corporation,
wholly
owned
by
one
individual.
the
testimony
was
given
as
to
why
the
accumulations
were
being
retained
and
the
jury
evidently
didn't
feel
satisfied
because
they
found
for
the
government,
they
found
that
they
were
unreasonable
accumulations.
we're
talking
about
accumulations
that
come
about
because
of
loans
to
relatives,
accumulations
that
come
about
because
of
large
portfolios
of
stock
that
have
no
relationship
to
the
corporation.
these
are
not
normally
the
situation
that
you
find
with
a
large
listed
corporation
and
--
mr.
mitchell
rogovin
1913.
mr.
mitchell
rogovin
that's
--
those
are
the
words
but
it's
the
taxpayers'
burden.
mr.
mitchell
rogovin
that
the
structure
of
the
tax
would
reach
that
result.
mr.
mitchell
rogovin
as
long
as
the
accumulation
were
reasonable,
he
would
still
win,
that's
correct.
mr.
mitchell
rogovin
well,
as
to
those
accumulations,
he
may
have
a
million
dollar
accumulation
and
the
taxpayer
may
have
15
or
20
purposes
ascribed
to
the
accumulation
and
then
the
trier
of
fact
would
determine
whether
for
example
monies
that
were
set
aside
for
a
fear
of
a
depression,
a
reserve
that
was
set
up
of
that
nature
was
a
reasonable
type
of
reserve,
the
court
may
say
no,
that's
unreasonable.
mr.
mitchell
rogovin
well,
the
court
could
find
that
both
that
the
accumulation
were
reasonable
if
and
that
concurrently
throughout
all
of
this,
there
was
a
tax
avoidance
motive.
mr.
mitchell
rogovin
and
the
credit
would
allow
that
portion
which
is
determined
to
be
reasonable.
but
as
to
those
portions
that
are
not
determined
to
be
reasonable,
those
plans
--
mr.
mitchell
rogovin
well,
it's
simply
that
the
trier
of
fact
determine
that
that
wasn't
a
reasonable.
mr.
mitchell
rogovin
there
would
be
a
$100,000.00.
mr.
mitchell
rogovin
that
is
correct.
mr.
mitchell
rogovin
that's
correct.
mr.
mitchell
rogovin
that's
correct
and
what
the
lower
court
--
what
the
sixth
circuit
has
done
in
this
case
is
to
set
up
an
unintended
element
in
the
case,
in
the
statute.
they
are
saying
that
if
a
corporation
with
an
admitted
tax
avoidance
purpose
that
this
corporation
could
avoid
the
penalty,
if
the
trier
of
fact
was
persuaded
that
at
least
equal
weight
was
to
be
given
to
the
non-tax
reasons
ascribed
by
the
corporation.
now,
we
believe
this
is
an
erroneous
statement
of
the
statute.
if
a
corporation
has
a
variety
of
motives
for
the
accumulation,
it
doesn't
matter
which
motive
predominates.
congress
provided
for
the
elimination
of
the
tax
through
the
credit
to
the
extent
that
they're
demonstrable
business
needs
to
justify
the
accumulation
and
what
the
sixth
circuit
is
doing
is
putting
into
the
statute
an
extremely
heavy
burden.
mr.
mitchell
rogovin
no,
there
has
to
be
the
finding
under
532
finding
that
the
purpose
of
the
accumulation
was
to
avoid
the
tax
at
the
shareholder
level.
now,
there
is
a
presumption
--
mr.
mitchell
rogovin
there
was
no
evidence
of
that
nature
that
the
$1,678,000.00
was
the
accumulation
over
years.
mr.
mitchell
rogovin
well
there
were
some
indication
if
they
wanted
to
follow
on
the
footsteps
of
the
wrigley
company
but
there
were
definite
plans
as
to
what
he
was
going
to
do
with
these
funds.
i
might
add
that
this
--
mr.
mitchell
rogovin
well,
the
congress
has
uniformly
reenacted
the
statute
and
the
statute
has
the
effect.
the
policy
is
to
put
a
pressure
on
the
corporation
to
divulge,
to
distribute
dividends
where
they
have
no
other
use
for
the
accumulated
earnings
to
the
extent
that
there
is
another
purpose,
a
business
purpose.
mr.
mitchell
rogovin
yes,
it
was.
mr.
mitchell
rogovin
in
1938,
the
senate
finance
committee
had
an
opportunity
to
strengthen
the
presumption
in
the
statute
and
the
finance
committee
described
the
changes
that
took
place
as
quote,
this
is
in
the
page
17
of
the
brief,
“requiring
the
taxpayer
by
a
clear
preponderance
of
the
evidence
to
prove
the
absence
of
any
purpose
to
avoid
surtaxes
upon
shareholders
after
it
has
been
determined
that
the
earnings
and
profits
had
been
unreasonably
accumulated.
we
believe
that
the
decision
of
the
sixth
circuit
is
erroneous
that
this
decision
of
this
court
in
the
stock
yards
case
is
controlling.
mr.
mitchell
rogovin
as
to
the
language
of
this
court
with
respect
to
induces
or
aids
and
inducing,
the
purpose
in
question,
this
was
the
language
that
the
court
inserted.
the
first
circuit
had
spoken
of
substantial,
they
referred
to
avoidance
playing
a
substantial
part
and
this
court
ignored
that
language.
mr.
mitchell
rogovin
it
had.
yes
sir.
thank
you.
mr.
mitchell
rogovin
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
income
tax
case
dealing
with
the
construction
or
portion
of
the
accumulated
earnings
tax.
the
purpose
of
this
tax,
the
accumulated
earnings
tax,
which
has
been
a
part
of
our
tax
fabrics
since
1913,
is
to
deter
shareholders
of
a
corporation
from
avoiding
individual
income
tax
by
having
the
corporation
accumulate
earnings
beyond
the
reasonable
needs
of
the
corporation.
the
government's
petition
for
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
review
the
judgment
of
the
sixth
circuit
in
this
case
takes
place
because
the
sixth
circuit's
decision
was
in
conflict
with
four
other
circuits,
circuits
that
are
in
support
of
the
united
states
in
its
construction.
the
surplus
earnings
tax
deals
with
sections
531
through
537
of
the
internal
revenue
code
and
they
have
three
essential
features.
section
532
(a)
of
the
code
has
the
critical
operative
provision
in
the
context
of
the
accumulated
earnings
tax.
this
is
the
provision
that
imposes
the
special
tax
on
“every
corporation
formed
or
availed
of
for
the
purpose
of
avoiding
the
income
tax
with
respect
to
its
shareholders
by
permitting
earnings
and
profits
to
accumulate
instead
of
being
divided
or
distributed.”
this
feature
requires
a
particular
showing
of
conduct
and
a
particular
showing
of
a
state
of
mind.
questions
of
intent
and
state
of
mind
however
are
difficult
and
since
1913,
the
statute
has
carried
with
it
a
rebuttable
presumption
regarding
the
prohibited
purpose.
section
533
(a)
of
the
code
carries
the
prohibited
--
carries
this
presumption.
it
provides
that
the
fact
that
earnings
and
profits
are
permitted
to
accumulate
beyond
the
reasonable
needs
of
the
business
shall
be
determinative
of
the
purpose
to
avoid
the
income
tax
with
respect
to
shareholders
unless
the
corporation
by
the
preponderance
of
the
evidence
shall
prove
to
the
contrary.
finally,
since
1954,
there
has
been
a
credit
provision
within
the
accumulated
earnings
tax
and
this
is
found
at
535
(c),
the
most
significant
of
the
two
credits,
the
535
(c)
(1)
credit
which
in
essence
permits
a
credit
notwithstanding
the
presence
of
this
proscribed
purpose.
as
to
that
portion
of
the
accumulated
earnings
that
if
determined
by
the
trier
of
fact
to
be
reasonable,
although
the
ultimate
issue
is
whether
or
not
there's
a
proscribed
purpose,
whether
or
not
it
exists,
even
if
it's
found
to
exist,
the
credit
under
535
(c)
(1)
would
wash
out
the
tax
at
least
as
to
that
portion
of
the
accumulation
--
mr.
mitchell
rogovin
yes,
sir.
mr.
mitchell
rogovin
yes,
sir.
mr.
mitchell
rogovin
yes,
mr.
justice
white,
what
had
happened
prior
to
1954
was
that
if
there
are
any
portion
of
the
total
accumulation
were
determined
to
be
unreasonable,
then
the
tax
would
apply
to
the
totality
of
the
accumulation.
the
credit
in
1954
allowed
the
taxpayer
to
at
least
take
out
of
the
ambit
of
a
tax
that
portion
which
was
determined
to
be
reasonable
at
all
times
assuming
that
the
avoidance
purpose
existed.
mr.
mitchell
rogovin
pardon
me
sir.
mr.
mitchell
rogovin
with
the
requisite
of
intent.
the
intent
is
built
into
the
statute,
the
central
feature.
mr.
mitchell
rogovin
as
the
net
result
of
the
'54
credit.
to
summarize,
the
special
tax
will
imposed
if
the
purpose
of
avoiding
the
shareholder
tax
is
found
to
exists
either
because
of
the
presumption
in
533
(a)
or
if
it's
found
independently
of
it
but
subject
to
the
credit
for
so
much
of
the
retained
earnings
as
reasonably
needed
for
the
business.
now,
the
present
case
takes
the
form
of
a
suit
for
refund.
at
the
trial,
the
jury
heard
that
evidence
that
for
the
years
1960
and
1961,
the
respondent,
a
bubblegum
manufacturer
had
increased
the
accumulated
earnings
in
those
years
in
suit
from
approximately
1,638,000
to
1,679,000.
there
was
no
record
of
any
dividends
ever
being
paid
in
the
years
in
suit
or
any
indication
of
dividends
having
been
paid
since
the
inception
of
a
corporation
on
1947.
the
sole
stockholder
testified
that
the
reasons
for
the
accumulations
were
to
purchase
the
stock
of
respondent's
major
distributor.
there
was
also
a
testimony
that
the
accumulations
were
because
of
a
fear
of
depression,
possible
fear
of
war
and
also
a
desire
on
the
part
of
the
respondent
to
follow
by
expansion
the
footsteps
of
the
wrigley
company.
now,
in
response
to
interrogatories,
the
jury
found:
one,
that
during
the
years
in
suit,
the
respondent
had
accumulated
its
earnings
beyond
the
reasonable
or
reasonably
anticipated
needs
of
a
business
but
that
it
had
not
retained
its
earnings
for
the
purpose
of
avoiding
the
income
on
its
sole
shareholder.
the
government's
appeal
was
based
on
the
district
court's
refusal
to
define
the
phrase
“the
purpose”
as
it
relates
to
the
reason
for
the
retention
of
the
earnings.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
and
remanded
the
case
for
a
new
trial
holding
that
the
jury
might
well
have
been
led
to
believe
that
tax
avoidance
must
be
the
sole
purpose
behind
an
accumulation.
now,
this
position,
the
tax
avoidance
must
be
the
sole
purpose
and
not
been
asserted
by
either
of
the
parties.
the
sixth
circuit
in
reaching
this
decision
rejected
the
government's
position,
the
government's
request
for
a
jury
instruction
that
tax
avoidance
need
only
be
one
of
the
purposes
for
the
company's
accumulation
policy
and
the
sixth
circuit
went
on
to
hold
that
the
jury
should
be
instructed
that
the
accumulated
earnings
tax
applies
only
if
tax
avoidance
was
the
dominant,
controlling
or
impelling
motive.
the
government
seeks
to
review
in
this
court
because
we
believe
that
this
dominant
purpose
standard
is
erroneous.
we
believe
that
the
proper
view
was
the
view
that
was
requested
of
the
district
court,
that
tax
avoidance
need
only
be
one
of
the
purposes
of
an
accumulation
for
the
special
tax
to
come
into
play.
the
basic
purpose
of
sections
531
through
537
is
to
discourage
the
use
of
a
corporation
as
a
repository
for
accumulations.
accumulations
which
if
distributed
would
have
been
taxed
at
the
progressive
rates
upon
the
individual
shareholders
since
corporations
have
a
legal
existence
apart
from
that
of
the
individual
taxpayers
and
shareholders,
the
corporation
can
be
interposed
between
the
source
of
income
and
the
receipt
by
the
individual
owner,
thus
allowing
the
beneficial
owner
to
avoid
the
personal
income
tax,
the
tax
of
graduated
rates.
this
avoidance
device
has
been
recognized
by
congress
since
the
inception
of
the
modern
income
tax
in
1913
and
sections
531
through
537
are
an
effort,
a
statutory
effort
to
overcome
the
fact
that
we
do
not
have
integration
between
the
income
tax
and
the
corporate
tax.
the
purpose
of
the
accumulated
earnings
tax
is
as
this
court
had
concluded
in
helvering
v.
stock
yards,
318
u.s.
693
at
page
979,
“to
compel
the
company
to
distribute
any
profits
not
needed
for
the
conduct
of
its
business
so
that
when
so
distributed,
individual
shareholders
will
become
liable.”
underlying
this
--
underlying
the
statute
is
a
legislative
assumption
that
it
becomes
a
misuse
of
a
corporation
if
its
profits
are
retained
for
the
purpose
of
avoiding
the
stockholder's
individual
income
tax.
judge
learned
hand
in
united
business
corp.
62
f.2d
754
at
756
said
as
to
the
accumulated
earnings
tax,
“companies
may
accumulate
what
profits
they
please
so
long
as
they
do
not
defeat
the
fiscal
policies
of
the
united
states.
their
business
does
not
include
the
manipulation
of
dividends
to
avoid
taxes
by
definition
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
normal
management
of
their
affairs.”
now,
the
critical
language
in
this
provision
is
the
language
in
532
availed
of
for
the
purpose
of
avoiding
the
income
tax.
and
in
no
way
does
this
language
import
any
qualification
such
as
formulated
by
the
sixth
circuit
that
this
tax
avoidance
must
be
the
dominant
purpose
among
many
purposes.
availed
of
simply
means
used
to
the
extent
tax
avoidance
induces
or
aids
in
inducing
in
the
retention
of
accumulated
earnings.
the
corporation
has
been
used
or
in
the
statutory
language
“availed
of”
for
this
prohibited
purpose.
now,
the
government's
position
is
derived
from
the
plain
statutory
language
that
implies
no
further
qualification
and
also
from
this
court's
interpretation
of
that
statutory
language
in
the
stock
yards
case.
we
thought
as
did
four
circuits
that
this
issue
had
been
made
to
rest.
and
the
stock
yards
case,
the
first
circuit,
the
taxpayer
argued
that
the
accumulation
policy
of
the
corporation
was
intended
to
satisfy
the
debts
of
a
new
jersey
subsidiary
upon
its
contemplated
liquidation
in
1940.
now,
this
plan
had
been
inaugurated
prior
to
the
adoption
of
the
sixteenth
amendment
and
consistently
followed
by
the
corporation
thereafter,
so
that
argued
the
taxpayer,
the
corporation
could
not
have
been
availed
of
for
the
proscribed
purpose
that
out
in
the
law.
and
this
was
their
position
as
a
matter
of
law.
now,
although
the
first
circuit
reversed
the
board
of
tax
appeals
which
had
upheld
the
assertion
of
the
accumulated
tax.
the
first
circuit
rejected
the
taxpayer's
argument.
the
first
circuit
in
chicago
stock
yards
at
129
f.2d.937
at
page
948
said,
“it
is
clear
that
section
104
would
apply
if
in
the
totality
of
reason
which
induced
the
continuing
of
the
accumulation,
the
forbidden
motive
of
surtax
avoidance
played
a
substantial
part.”
the
first
circuit
thus
rejected
the
concept
of
a
dominant
purpose
theory.
it
was
in
this
context
that
the
case
came
to
this
court
and
this
court
stated
at
page
699,
“a
corporate
practice
adopted
for
the
mere
convenience
above
or
for
other
reasons
and
without
tax
significance
when
adopted
may
have
been
continued
with
the
additional
motive
of
avoiding
surtax
on
the
sharehold
--
stockholders.
the
board's
conclusion,
that
is
the
conclusion
of
the
board
of
tax
appeals
that
the
accumulated
earnings
tax
was
to
impose,
may
justifiably
have
been
reached
in
the
view
that
whatever
the
motive
when
the
practice
of
accumulation
was
adopted,
the
purpose
of
avoiding
surtax
induced
or
aided
in
inducing,
the
continuance
of
the
practice.”
mr.
mitchell
rogovin
this
is
in
the
stock
yards
case
mr.
justice
black,
318
u.s.
at
page
699.
mr.
mitchell
rogovin
i
believe
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
mitchell
rogovin
well,
it's
two-part
test.
the
objective
part
of
the
test
has
not
been
considered
in
your
hypothetical
and
that
is
--
are
the
accumulations
unreasonable
or
the
funds
retained
for
the
purpose
of
avoiding
the
surtax
on
individuals?
mr.
mitchell
rogovin
i
believe
the
track
record
of
the
revenue
service
in
this
regard
tends
to
indicate
that
they
are
looking
at
a
small,
closely
held
corporation.
mr.
mitchell
rogovin
the
concern
of
the
congress
in
passing
the
accumulated
earnings
tax
was
a
concern
that
the
stockholders
could
so
manipulate
the
corporation
and
thereby
require
or
cause
the
corporation
to
retain
earnings,
earnings
that
would
not
be
passed
on
to
the
stockholders.
mr.
mitchell
rogovin
well,
that's
a
presumption
that
the
congress
indulged
in,
in
assuming
that
there's
close
relation
between
stockholders
and
corporation
could
cause
this
result
and
that
there
would
be
no
objective
evidence
to
demonstrate
tax
avoidance
and
so
the
presumption
was
built
into
the
statute.
mr.
mitchell
rogovin
no
theoretically,
it
could
be
applicable
to
a
large
listed
corporation,
if
the
listed
corporation
mr.
justice
fortas
at
the
liquid
assets
and
the
accumulated
cash
in
an
unreasonable
posture
for
the
states
--
mr.
mitchell
rogovin
i
believe
that
it
had
been
applied
in
one
case.
mr.
mitchell
rogovin
trico
to
a
1500
stockholders.
mr.
mitchell
rogovin
that's
about
the
largest,
yes
sir.
mr.
mitchell
rogovin
technically
it
would
open
it
up
to
--
technically
we
have
construed
--
we
were
construing
it
as
it
has
always
been
construed.
to
respond
to
your
question,
however,
i
feel
the
question
of
the
nature
of
the
accumulation
would
differ
substantially
than
the
large
corporation.
mr.
mitchell
rogovin
i
believe
the
pressures
of
large
listed
corporations,
the
stockholder
pressures
are
such
that
large
amounts
of
liquid
assets
not
being
applied
for
the
purposes
of
the
corporation
would
generate
better
management
if
not
dividends.
mr.
mitchell
rogovin
i
have
no
answer
to
that
question
mr.
chief
justice.
i
believe
that
clearly,
the
--
mr.
mitchell
rogovin
it
does
exist
and
that's
what
congress
was
concerned
about
in
the
main
and
has
been
expressed
this
concern
throughout
the
reenactments
of
the
statutes
since
1913
but
there
has
been
no
indication
that
the
statute
would
not
apply
to
a
large
corporation
if
the
factual
pattern
so
existed.
i
don't
think
the
revenue
service
is
binding
itself
that
it
would
not
go
order
a
large
corporation
and
raise
this
issue
if
it
existed.
but
the
facts
just
don't
support
it
in
the
large
corporations.
mr.
mitchell
rogovin
yes
sir,
that's
correct.
mr.
mitchell
rogovin
right.
mr.
mitchell
rogovin
the
distributor,
yes.
mr.
mitchell
rogovin
this
was
a
solely
owned
corporation,
wholly
owned
by
one
individual.
the
testimony
was
given
as
to
why
the
accumulations
were
being
retained
and
the
jury
evidently
didn't
feel
satisfied
because
they
found
for
the
government,
they
found
that
they
were
unreasonable
accumulations.
we're
talking
about
accumulations
that
come
about
because
of
loans
to
relatives,
accumulations
that
come
about
because
of
large
portfolios
of
stock
that
have
no
relationship
to
the
corporation.
these
are
not
normally
the
situation
that
you
find
with
a
large
listed
corporation
and
--
mr.
mitchell
rogovin
1913.
mr.
mitchell
rogovin
that's
--
those
are
the
words
but
it's
the
taxpayers'
burden.
mr.
mitchell
rogovin
that
the
structure
of
the
tax
would
reach
that
result.
mr.
mitchell
rogovin
as
long
as
the
accumulation
were
reasonable,
he
would
still
win,
that's
correct.
mr.
mitchell
rogovin
well,
as
to
those
accumulations,
he
may
have
a
million
dollar
accumulation
and
the
taxpayer
may
have
15
or
20
purposes
ascribed
to
the
accumulation
and
then
the
trier
of
fact
would
determine
whether
for
example
monies
that
were
set
aside
for
a
fear
of
a
depression,
a
reserve
that
was
set
up
of
that
nature
was
a
reasonable
type
of
reserve,
the
court
may
say
no,
that's
unreasonable.
mr.
mitchell
rogovin
well,
the
court
could
find
that
both
that
the
accumulation
were
reasonable
if
and
that
concurrently
throughout
all
of
this,
there
was
a
tax
avoidance
motive.
mr.
mitchell
rogovin
and
the
credit
would
allow
that
portion
which
is
determined
to
be
reasonable.
but
as
to
those
portions
that
are
not
determined
to
be
reasonable,
those
plans
--
mr.
mitchell
rogovin
well,
it's
simply
that
the
trier
of
fact
determine
that
that
wasn't
a
reasonable.
mr.
mitchell
rogovin
there
would
be
a
$100,000.00.
mr.
mitchell
rogovin
that
is
correct.
mr.
mitchell
rogovin
that's
correct.
mr.
mitchell
rogovin
that's
correct
and
what
the
lower
court
--
what
the
sixth
circuit
has
done
in
this
case
is
to
set
up
an
unintended
element
in
the
case,
in
the
statute.
they
are
saying
that
if
a
corporation
with
an
admitted
tax
avoidance
purpose
that
this
corporation
could
avoid
the
penalty,
if
the
trier
of
fact
was
persuaded
that
at
least
equal
weight
was
to
be
given
to
the
non-tax
reasons
ascribed
by
the
corporation.
now,
we
believe
this
is
an
erroneous
statement
of
the
statute.
if
a
corporation
has
a
variety
of
motives
for
the
accumulation,
it
doesn't
matter
which
motive
predominates.
congress
provided
for
the
elimination
of
the
tax
through
the
credit
to
the
extent
that
they're
demonstrable
business
needs
to
justify
the
accumulation
and
what
the
sixth
circuit
is
doing
is
putting
into
the
statute
an
extremely
heavy
burden.
mr.
mitchell
rogovin
no,
there
has
to
be
the
finding
under
532
finding
that
the
purpose
of
the
accumulation
was
to
avoid
the
tax
at
the
shareholder
level.
now,
there
is
a
presumption
--
mr.
mitchell
rogovin
there
was
no
evidence
of
that
nature
that
the
$1,678,000.00
was
the
accumulation
over
years.
mr.
mitchell
rogovin
well
there
were
some
indication
if
they
wanted
to
follow
on
the
footsteps
of
the
wrigley
company
but
there
were
definite
plans
as
to
what
he
was
going
to
do
with
these
funds.
i
might
add
that
this
--
mr.
mitchell
rogovin
well,
the
congress
has
uniformly
reenacted
the
statute
and
the
statute
has
the
effect.
the
policy
is
to
put
a
pressure
on
the
corporation
to
divulge,
to
distribute
dividends
where
they
have
no
other
use
for
the
accumulated
earnings
to
the
extent
that
there
is
another
purpose,
a
business
purpose.
mr.
mitchell
rogovin
yes,
it
was.
mr.
mitchell
rogovin
in
1938,
the
senate
finance
committee
had
an
opportunity
to
strengthen
the
presumption
in
the
statute
and
the
finance
committee
described
the
changes
that
took
place
as
quote,
this
is
in
the
page
17
of
the
brief,
“requiring
the
taxpayer
by
a
clear
preponderance
of
the
evidence
to
prove
the
absence
of
any
purpose
to
avoid
surtaxes
upon
shareholders
after
it
has
been
determined
that
the
earnings
and
profits
had
been
unreasonably
accumulated.
we
believe
that
the
decision
of
the
sixth
circuit
is
erroneous
that
this
decision
of
this
court
in
the
stock
yards
case
is
controlling.
mr.
mitchell
rogovin
as
to
the
language
of
this
court
with
respect
to
induces
or
aids
and
inducing,
the
purpose
in
question,
this
was
the
language
that
the
court
inserted.
the
first
circuit
had
spoken
of
substantial,
they
referred
to
avoidance
playing
a
substantial
part
and
this
court
ignored
that
language.
mr.
mitchell
rogovin
it
had.
yes
sir.
thank
you.
