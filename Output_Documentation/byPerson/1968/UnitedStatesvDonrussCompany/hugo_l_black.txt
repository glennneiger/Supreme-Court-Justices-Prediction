what
case
was
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
was
this
law
passed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you,
if
a
single
stockholder
of
the
corporation
made
any
effort
to
prove
that
in
the
manufacture
of
bubblegum
he
needed
more
than
a
$1,700,000.00
profit
in
one
year
in
order
to
carry
on
his
business?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
he
indicate
that
he
wanted
to
enlarge
the
bubblegum
business
for
that
additional
fund?
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
recall
it,
the
roosevelt
administration
at
one
time
thought
that
this
law
was
not
enough
to
prevent
tax
evasion
and
attempted
to
get
laws
through
which
would
coerce
payments
to
the
stockholders
in
order
to
make
them
liable
for
the
tax,
isn't
that
right?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
is
a
great
trouble
in
the
court
to
go
the
good
resentment
against
such
a
law.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that
was
strengthened
during
the
roosevelt
administration
at
one
time,
wasn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
by
the
tax
law
which
went
further.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
if
you
know
why
the
senate
or
congress
show
why
they
struck
out
the
word
fraudulently?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
he
hadn't
incorporated,
could
he
expand?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
you
were
the
judge,
the
trial
judge
on
the
charge
to
the
jury,
how
would
you
define
that
duty
to
find
whether
it
was
reasonable
or
unreasonable?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
of
course.
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
much
would
motive
have
to
do
with
your
charge
if
you
were
charging
about
reasonable
and
how
much
would
you
do
it
on
the
basis?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
they
have
to
determine
whether
it's
reasonable
without
regard
the
motive?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
then
congress
intend
that
to
hit
straight
and
letting
a
tax
authority
or
somebody
determine
whether
they
have
accumulated
more
than
what's
reasonable
of
these
and
its
purposes?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
then
it
put
difficult
general
with
tax
cases
to
jury
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
to
prove
the
mind
and
find
out
how
many
of
the
dominant
purposes
was
one
thing
and
how
many
was
another?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
suppose
the
company
was
a
$2,000.00
corporation
and
it
sold
$2
million
worth
of
product,
goods
whatever
it
was?
it
made
a
million
and
a
half
profit.
would
the
motive
of
the
men
who
say
that
a
million
and
a
half
didn't
pay
everything
out
have
anything
to
do
with
what
the
jury
should
find?
