justice
abe
fortas
mr.
rogovin,
i
suppose
it's
true
that
most
companies
now
in
for
many
years
have
most
very
large
companies
paid
out
only
a
small
fraction
of
their
earnings,
isn't
that
true
as
dividends?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
is
it
--
does
the
bureau
proceed
on
the
assumption
that
some
of
the
largest
companies
are
totally
without
the
purpose
of
tax
avoidance
for
the
stockholders
and
that
process
of
accumulation
take
anyone
of
them
you
like
as
an
illustration,
any
of
the
largest
companies.
take
anyone
of
them
that
you
like
and
can
the
bureau
and
does
the
bureau
assume
that
the
rule
you
advocate
would
or
would
not
compel
you
to
go
after
them.
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that
part
of
it.
i
understand
that
problem
i
think.
but
some
of
them
might
be
big,
aren't
they?
justice
abe
fortas
that
one
--
that's
exactly.
that
what
bothers
me
and
is
--
as
i
understand
it
the
statutory
provision
has
been
used
almost
exclusively
with
respect
to
the
small
closely
held
corporations
and
what
my
question
to
you
is
whether
the
standard
for
you
to
contend
would
have
an
impact
upon
that
or
whether
it
would
--
whether
it's
the
bureau's
view
that
the
standard
is
correct
and
you
have
a
problem
presented
by
the
large
corporations.
justice
abe
fortas
i
don't
think
you're
contending
that
that
should
be
the
--
a
condition
precedent
to
the
bureau's
bulletin
to
invoke
this
section,
are
you?
justice
abe
fortas
are
you
telling
this
court
that
the
bureau
construes
this
statute,
these
sections
on
unreasonable
accumulations
as
applicable
only
to
the
small
closely
held
corporation?
justice
abe
fortas
was
it
ever
been
applied
to
any
company
other
than
a
small
closely
held
company?
justice
abe
fortas
that's
the
largest.
justice
abe
fortas
i
know
the
--
i
believe
the
origin
of
these
provisions
way
back
under
section
102
i
think
were
the
christiana
corporation
and
those
closely
held
companies
but
certainly
the
wording
of
the
statute
is
much
broader
and
certainly
the
rule
for
which
you
are
now
contending
would
literally
and
in
any
event
open
up
the
question
of
the
large
corporations
that
are
held
generally,
isn't
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
what
you're
saying
isn't
that
a
large
corporation
might
or
it
might
not
be
able
to
show
some
intended
or
prospective
need
for
the
accumulation
great
enough
and
immanent
enough
to
justify
their
holding
onto
without
the
accumulation
being
characterized
as
unreasonable.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that's
debatable.
justice
abe
fortas
because
the
concern
of
the
congress
was
in
the
retention
for
the
benefit
of
shareholders
and
in
the
large
corporations,
listed
corporations
with
hundreds
of
thousands
of
shareholders,
that
potential
just
doesn't
exist
as
any
degree
of
frequency.
justice
abe
fortas
but
why
in
this
particular
case
for
example
isn't
the
suggestion
that
the
accumulated
on
list
because
they
were
thinking
about
going
out
in
the
market
and
buying
the
stock
of
a
company
that
owned
what
was
a
substantial
block
if
they
were
going
out
the
market
and
buy
some
of
the
stock
of
a
related
company?
justice
abe
fortas
they
have
never
done
it.
well,
as
i
remember
the
facts
of
this
case.
but
nevertheless
they
said
that
they
were
fixed
and
we're
thinking
about
getting
bigger
stock
acquisition.
why
didn't
that
put
them
in
the
category
of
a
big
company
rather
than
a
small
company
for
purposes
of
the
application
so
to
speak
of
this
statute?
justice
abe
fortas
but
we
know,
do
we
have
that
before
us
or
don't,
isn't
the
matter
issue
before
us
the
government's
request
for
an
instruction
the
denial
of
that
instruction
then
the
action
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
reversing
for
further
procedures
pursuant
to
the
standard
that
it
laid
down?
justice
abe
fortas
and
all
of
these
being
with
respect
to
the
question
of
purpose
or
intent.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
the
government
would
not
agree
with
that
characterization,
would
it?
justice
abe
fortas
because
it's
not
whether
the
effect
of
the
distribution
would
be
to
subject
the
stockholder
to
tax
but
whether
that
was
one
of
the
motives
and
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
withholding
the
distribution.
justice
abe
fortas
i
guess
it
gets
pretty
abstruse
but
and
maybe
those
difference
between
and
what
we're
struggling
with
is
a
shading
between
the
words
“purpose,
effect
and
motive.”
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
braunstein,
consideration
that
bothers
me
in
this
case
following
the
quote
by
mr.
justice
white,
is
it's
arguable
that
the
standard
adopted
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
what
you're
contending
here
is
contrary
really
to
what
the
congress
expressly
provided
and
that
in
a
way
it
undermines
the
specific
language
of
section
533
(a).
and
533
(a)
really
makes
the
test
of
that
intent
to
avoid
stockholder
tax
a
very
minor
consequence
as
i
read
it,
it
says
that
once
you
find
that
the
earnings
of
the
corporation
are
permitted
or
accumulate
beyond
the
reasonable
needs
of
the
business
that
that
“shall
be
determinative
of
the
purpose
to
avoid
the
income
tax
with
respect
to
shareholders
unless
the
corporation
by
the
preponderance
of
the
evidence
shall
prove
to
the
contrary.”
now,
those
are
very
rugged
standards
but
they're
congress'
standards
whether
one
makes
a
good,
bad,
or
indifferent
they
are
in
the
law.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
even
if
you
assume
that
if
you
go
the
other
way
and
adopt
a
dominant
purpose
test
as
the
court
of
appeals
did
below
and
as
you're
agreeing
would
seem
to
go
to
the
opposite
extreme
and
to
undermine
what
seems
to
be
the
fairly
obvious
intention
of
the
congress?
justice
abe
fortas
there's
something
else
being
a
reasonable
needs
of
the
business
but
as
my
brother
white
was
pointing
out
that
if
you
can
show
that
this
accumulation
was
needed
for
the
reasonable
needs
of
the
business
you
never
get
to
the
question
of
--
justice
abe
fortas
and
the
problem
that
i'm
putting
to
you
is
raised
simply
whether
your
argument
is
properly
addressed
to
this
court
or
to
the
congress?
justice
abe
fortas
(voice

let's
down
the
matter
of
unraveling
what
the
congress
really
intended
what
the
spiritual
thrust
of
the
legislation
