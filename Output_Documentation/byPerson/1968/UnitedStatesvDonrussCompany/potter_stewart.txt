justice
potter
stewart
now,
mr.
rogovin,
the
stock
yards
case
was
a
case
in
which
the
board
of
tax
appeals
has
found
first
of
all
that
the
corporation
when
they
say
was
prince
in
corporate
clothes
that
involved
a
man
by
the
name
of
mr.
prince
and
then
the
board
of
tax
appeals
further
found
that
the
sole
purpose,
the
sole
purpose
of
the
retention
of
earnings
was
to
avoid
taxes.
that
have
been
the
finding
by
the
bta
in
that
case,
hadn't
it?
and
the
issue
in
this
case
once
it
finally
got
here
was
whether
or
not
a
corporation
originally
formed
for
another
purpose
could
later
be
availed
of,
the
retention
of
earnings
for
the
prohibited
purpose,
that
was
the
basic
issue
here
then
finally
there
was
a
question
of
accepting
the
fact
finding
of
the
bta.
justice
potter
stewart
the
administrative
body,
the
fact
finding
body
had
found
that
it
was
the
sole
purpose
of
mr.
prince,
of
mr.
prince's
corporation,
had
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
the
government
--
the
government
says
that
its
position
is
that
it's
up
to
the
taxpayer
to
prove
in
complete
absence
of
any
tax
avoidance
purpose
and
your
point
is
that
that's
impossible
to
do.
justice
potter
stewart
would
not
result
in
any
(voice
overlap)?
justice
potter
stewart
are
you
referring
to
the
government's
position
as
the
a
purpose
position?
i
want
to
be
sure
i
understand
what
you're
talking.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
a,
it's
not
any
purpose?
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
it
was
a
reference
to
subsection
a
of
the
statute
(voice
overlap).
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
under
the
statute
that
the
judge
would
have
to
state
that
to
find
that
it
is
reasonable
you
would
have
to
find
that
the
taxpayer
had
fixed
and
definite
commitments.
he
had
contracts
which
require
the
expenditure
of
these
funds.
the
fact
that
taxpayer
intended
whether
you
believe
he
intended
or
not
to
expand
and
diversify
or
was
attempting
to
diversify
does
not
qualify
under
the
reasonable
accumulation
test.
