mr.
richard
l.
braunstein
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
before
this
court
is
the
construction
of
the
statute
that's
been
on
the
books
for
many,
many
years
since
1913.
the
statute
as
enacted
at
that
time
provided
that
a
corporation
formed
or
fraudulently
availed
of
for
the
purpose
of
preventing
tax
on
the
shareholders
would
trigger
a
penalty
tax
on
the
shareholder
at
that
time.
there
was
a
rebuttable
presumption
then
as
there
is
now
that
if
earnings
were
permitted
to
accumulate
beyond
the
reasonable
needs
of
the
business
that
this
was
prima
facie
evidence
for
the
purpose
to
escape
the
tax.
the
statute
has
been
amended
throughout
the
years,
the
word
fraudulently
was
excised.
the
tax
is
now
imposed
on
the
corporation
rather
than
the
shareholders
and
instead
of
a
prima
facie
evidence
or
rebuttable
presumption,
we
have
a
virtual
determinative
assumption
and
once
a
corporation
accumulates
its
earnings
beyond
its
reasonable
needs
that
unless
the
taxpayer
can
come
forward
and
determinatively
show
otherwise
that
the
penalty
applies.
mr.
richard
l.
braunstein
i
think
there
was
the
question
that
under
common
law,
it
was
very
difficult
to
establish
fraud
and
that
was
the
reason
that
was
struck
out.
the
reason
that
the
tax
was
then
imposed
on
the
shareholder,
it
was
first
imposed
on
the
shareholders
then
it
was
thought
perhaps
that
it
was
first
imposed
on
the
corporate
shareholder
and
then
on
a
corporation,
that
was
a
constitutional
question
involved.
but
i
think
the
purpose
going
into
the
statute
that
reading
the
early
cases
is
that
there
are
a
lot
of
holding
company
cases
involved
here.
at
the
time
the
statute
was
enacted,
there
was
no
corporate
tax,
taxpayers
were
permitted
to
deal
with
their
corporation
in
situations
which
would
lead
to
tax
avoidance
and
what
happened
many
taxpayers
were
able
to,
who
had
stocks
and
securities
in
receiving
income
on
that
were
able
to
put
it
in
a
corporate
shell
and
really
isolate
themselves,
and
insulate
themselves
from
any
taxes.
in
addition,
the
taxpayer
was
permitted
to
sell
stock
which
he
had
purchased
to
his
corporation
and
if
you
realize
the
laws
on
that,
he
could
take
it
and
i
think
if
this
came
up,
this
case
came
up
in
1913,
we
can
make
a
very
strong
argument
that
the
purpose
required
was
the
sole
purpose
and
that
the
court
used
the
word
formed
fraudulently
because
it
was
talking
about
a
situation
where
a
corporation
was
used
in
a
fraudulent
manner,
in
a
manner
inconsistent
as
what
we
deemed
to
be
the
normal
use
of
a
corporation.
and
i
think
have
this
case
come
up,
we
could
say
that
the
case,
the
statute
would
only
apply
if
there
was
absolutely
no
reason,
no
valid
reason
that
the
sole
purpose
for
the
shareholder
of
forming
this
corporation
had
to
be
tax
avoidance.
mr.
richard
l.
braunstein
the
sole
valid
--
well,
that
the
sole
purpose
for
the
corporation,
there
was
no
business
reason
that
before
the
penalty
was
to
apply,
the
court
would
have
to
find
that
the
sole
and
only
purpose
of
forming
the
corporation
was
--
mr.
richard
l.
braunstein
i
think
basically
coming
down
to
our
test
and
what
the
sixth
circuit
has
really
assigned
is
that
once
it
shown
that
the
accumulation
is
beyond
the
objective
reasonable
needs
of
the
business
and
that
phrase
has
tremendous
significance,
that's
been
determined
as
fixed,
definite,
certain
plans.
almost
balance
sheet
liabilities
and
written
commitments.
now,
once
the
taxpayer
has
accumulated
beyond
that,
and
the
fact
that
he
says,
“well,
my
purpose
is
really
i'd
like
to
expand.
i'd
like
to
acquire
but
i
just
can't
go
out
and
buy
a
newspaper
or
a
radio
station
or
a
cement
plant.
it's
just
impossible.
i'm
looking.”
the
position
of
the
government
today
is
that
you
have
--
you're
out
of
the
ball
game
and
the
reason
they
say
that
is
they
say
what
is
the
a
purpose
test?
how
do
we
determine
that?
well,
it's
very
simple,
they
say
if
the
shareholder
is
subject
to
taxable
income,
he's
in
a
tax
bracket,
he
has
no
operating
law
as
carryovers
and
he
has
been
advised
that
a
distribution
would
result
in
taxable
income.
well,
that's
all
you
have
to
show
because
then
it
follows
that
accumulating
results
in
an
avoidance
of
the
tax
which
is
true.
mr.
richard
l.
braunstein
and
the
avoidance
is
the
purpose.
there's
--
even
though
he
might
--
mr.
richard
l.
braunstein
it
isn't.
i
think
the
government
concedes,
he
might
have
100
purposes
and
that
you
might
be
talking
about
tax
avoidance
or
the
tax
purpose
might
be
incident,
remote,
he
would
not
really
care
about
it
but
the
tax
applies,
that's
the
government's
position.
they
say,
if
it's
one
out
of
100
reasons,
the
tax
applies.
basically,
if
you
take
that
approach
--
mr.
richard
l.
braunstein
it's
impossible,
you
can't
do
it.
the
only
two
situations
that
i
could
think
of
is
that
if
you
have
a
net
operating
loss
carryover,
we
can
show
the
distribution
--
mr.
richard
l.
braunstein
--
will
not
result
in
any
income.
or
in
the
other
situation
where
someone
has
just
completely
and
honestly
ignorant
and
had
not
been
advised
but
these
are
--
it
just
doesn't
happen.
and
i
think
the
whole
point
of
the
government's
position
is
really
not
asking
for
a
construction
of
the
statute.
i
mean
you
can
forget
about
availed
of
for
purpose.
what
the
government's
position
in
effect
of
saying
is
that
if
you
accumulate
beyond
fixed
definite
and
reasonable
needs;
forget
about
it
if
you
are
a
closely
held
corporation.
and
we
think
that
at
least
that
a
small
businessman
should
have
the
opportunity
to
try
to
rebut
this
presumption.
now,
the
sixth
circuit
isn't
giving
anything
here.
i
mean,
when
you
talk
about
it,
the
burden,
that's
the
determinative
burden
which
this
taxpayer
has
to
show
that
the
tax
avoidance
was
not
the
dominant
or
impelling
motive.
well,
he
just
can't
sit
up
there
and
say,
“well,
that
wasn't
my
motive.”
he's
got
to
be
fairly
specific
and
concrete
in
what
he's
saying
and
i
think
that
the
thing
that
really
disturbs
us
about
this
case
is
you're
really
preventing
expansion
of
the
smaller
corporation.
i
just
can't
see
how
he
could
expand
under
the
government's
interpretation.
mr.
richard
l.
braunstein
i
think
he
could
sir,
yes.
but
he'd
be
at
a
tremendous
disadvantage
on
the
publicly
held
companies.
i
think
you've
got
a
reverse
twist
justice.
i
think
perhaps
1913,
when
this
statute
was
enacted,
the
business
was
held
and
closely
held
family
groups
and
they
represented
the
substantial
and
economic
power
in
this
country.
i
think
things
have
changed
where
the
substantial
economic
powers
in
the
publicly
held
corporations
with
a
statute
which
was
aimed
at
the
power,
the
economic
power
is
now
being
applied
against
the
little
men
and
the
persons
that
it
was
intended
to
cover
initially
are
just
not
being
covered
at
this
particular
time.
and
i
think
basically,
our
position
here
is
that
simple
that
what
the
government
asked
is
not
a
construction
of
the
statute.
there
is
no
construction,
there
is
no
statute
and
we
think
the
only
real
tenable
and
reasonable
view
is
the
position
of
the
sixth
circuit.
mr.
richard
l.
braunstein
may
it
please
the
court.
i
believe
the
impression
was
left
yesterday
that
a
taxpayer
in
this
case
accumulated
a
substantial
amount
of
funds
and
the
sole
purpose
was
the
avoidance
of
tax
but
that
was
not
the
decision
of
the
court
below.
the
first
inquiry
is
whether
the
accumulation
exceeds
the
reasonable
needs
of
taxpayer's
business.
but
this
phrase
has
come
to
me
in
the
fixed,
definite,
and
certain
needs
of
the
business
or
written
obligation
of
the
taxpayer.
it's
a
test
which
the
government
has
tried
to
restrict
as
closely
as
possible.
mr.
richard
l.
braunstein
i
think
you're
correct.
mr.
richard
l.
braunstein
that's
correct.
this
issue
is
not
before
the
court
but
i
think
it's
pertinent
in
terms
of
the
effect
of
what
the
government
proposes
to
ask
this
court
to
set
the
test
because
in
circumstances
like
this,
the
jury
found
that
the
taxpayer
did
not
have
fixed
and
definite
purposes
but
they
held
that
he
did
not
have
a
tax
avoidance
purpose.
the
taxpayer
stated
that
he
had
plans
for
expansion,
he
intended
to
buy
stock
in
a
distributor
and
the
theory
we
can
infer
believe
that
this
was
the
purpose
motivating
his
conduct.
so,
while
it
was
not
fixed,
definite,
and
certain,
nevertheless,
it
was
a
permissible
purpose
and
the
facts
were
that
the
taxpayer
did
purchase
$380,000.00
worth
of
the
distributor's
stock
that
the
taxpayer
did
expand
and
it
was
because
of
this
expansion
and
purchase
that
the
taxpayers
continue
to
be
successful
but
the
critical
point
is
that
it's
the
government's
position
that
in
adopting
the
a
purpose
test,
you
would
then
ask
the
taxpayer
only
two
questions.
number
one,
if
the
distribution
was
made
to
you
would
it
be
taxable?
number
two,
were
you
aware
that
if
a
distribution
was
made
to
you
it
would
be
taxable?
and
if
both
of
those
answers
were
yes,
then
it's
my
understanding
that
regardless
of
the
fact
that
taxpayer's
purpose
is
dominant
purpose
the
whole
purpose
of
the
accumulation
was
for
expansion
to
preserve
and
expand
the
business
that
nevertheless
the
penalty
would
apply.
mr.
richard
l.
braunstein
i
haven't
heard
them
deny
that
characterization.
mr.
richard
l.
braunstein
that's
not
--
mr.
richard
l.
braunstein
i
don't
regard
that
that
is
what
the
government
is
asking
this
court
to
rule
on.
i
think
they
say
very
clearly
that
if
the
avoidance
of
tax
is
one
of
100
purposes
regardless
of
its
significance
then
the
tax
applies
and
how
do
you
determine
what
do
you
mean
by
avoidance
of
tax?
well,
avoidance
of
tax
is
knowledge
that
a
distribution
results
in
taxable
income
and
the
whole
thrust
of
the
government's
argument
and
our
argument
here
is
such
a
test
really
rights
out
the
purpose
test
because
this
--
mr.
richard
l.
braunstein
i
think
that
is
correct
and
it's
basically
our
position
that
the
sixth
circuit
correctly
characterized
the
test
in
terms
of
the
dominant
and
impelling
motive.
it's
--
i
think
one
of
the
difficult
things
is
the
burden
of
proof
that
the
taxpayer
has
and
if
you
enunciate
a
test
other
than
the
dominant
or
impelling
test
whether
it
has
any
meaning
because
once
the
court
finds
that
an
accumulation
is
beyond
the
objectively
reasonable
needs
of
the
business
we're
face
or
the
taxpayer
is
face
with
a
determinative
presumption.
he
has
to
go
forward
and
prove
in
very
heavy
burden
that
this
was
not
the
purpose.
he
obviously
cannot
say,
“well,
that
was
not
my
purpose.
i
don't
think
that
carries
the
burden.”
i
think
he's
compelled
to
give
specific
and
definite
reasons
as
it
relates
to
his
motivation.
now,
as
a
practical
matter,
these
cases
are
tried
four
or
five
years
after
the
year
in
issue
and
he
cannot
fabricate.
i
--
i
think
there
is
--
the
government
is
concerned
about
that
these
are
subjective
matters
that
there
is
no
objective
way
to
determine
or
test
the
testimony
of
the
taxpayer.
but
this
is
not
true.
he's
talking
about
a
situation
of
his
intentions
of
his
plans
and
we're
viewing
these
four
or
five
years
after
and
he
--
when
he
says
must
be
susceptible
to
objective
verification
or
reason.
and
it's
out
position
that
it's
only
through
utilization
of
the
dominant
or
impelling
test
that
there
is
any
meaning
in
the
phrase
avoidance
of
the
purpose
that
any
other
test
just
puts
an
impossible
burden
on
the
taxpayer
and
i
think
this
is
why
we
believe
the
government's
position
and
i
think
it's
very
clear
when
i
say,
“one
out
of
100.”
that's
enough
to
carry
today.
that
is
their
position.
mr.
richard
l.
braunstein
i
don't
gather
that
from
the
record.
i
think
the
government's
position
in
a
purpose
that
if
avoidance
of
the
taxes
a
purpose.
mr.
richard
l.
braunstein
i
think
the
jury
would
have
to
find
additional
--
mr.
richard
l.
braunstein
yes.
mr.
richard
l.
braunstein
unreasonable
and
our
point
is
that
--
mr.
richard
l.
braunstein
no,
i
don't
think
that's
true.
when
you
talk
about
the
unreasonable
means
of
the
business,
that
phrase
has
been
determined
as
requiring
fixed,
definite,
and
certain
needs,
something
that
is
susceptible
to
a
knowledge
that
this
is
going
to
require
a
liability.
now,
if
the
court
if
we
had
a
more
liberal
view
of
the
unreasonable
--
mr.
richard
l.
braunstein
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
l.
braunstein
i
think
it's
--
mr.
richard
l.
braunstein
i
would
think
so
because
one
of
the
things
that
concerns
me
or
disturbs
me
is
that
in
testing
what
is
unreasonable.
that's
not
a
very
broad
test.
it's
rather
limited
and
i
think
the
whole
thrust
of
our
argument
in
terms
of
the
unreasonable
test
--
mr.
richard
l.
braunstein
i
think
if
it
were
not
i
think
you'd
have
fewer
cases
going
on
the
purpose
test.
i
think
what
you
really
getting
here
is
expansion
problem.
the
taxpayer
that
intends
to
expand
desires
to
diversify
but
under
the
unreasonable
test
cannot
satisfy
it
because
he
does
not
his
plans
have
not
matured
to
the
state
required
by
the
statute.
and
our
position
is
in
view
of
the
fact
that
this
is
what
the
unreasonable
test
is
to
then
adopt
in
--
purpose
test
precludes
a
taxpayer
from
expanding.
mr.
richard
l.
braunstein
correct.
i
think
what
we're
saying
that
whatever
his
motivation
is
he's
not
looking
to
avoid
tax
but
he
honestly
believes
that
--
mr.
richard
l.
braunstein
well,
i
agree
with
you
and
i
think
they
are
very
difficult
standards
and
what
we're
saying
is
that
in
the
government's
view
to
adopt
an
a
purpose
test
really
writes
out
any
opportunity
of
the
taxpayer
to
attempt
to
meet
that
standard.
mr.
richard
l.
braunstein
i
view
that
really
as
a
burden
of
proof
aspect
that
congress
created
making
it
most
difficult
for
the
taxpayer
once
a
determination
has
been
made
that
the
accumulation
exceeds
the
“reasonable
needs”
of
the
business
that
a
very
difficult
burden
is
placed
on
the
taxpayer.
and
in
terms,
the
taxpayer
then
has
--
is
given
one
last
opportunity
as
i
view
it
to
show
that
his
conduct
was
not
motivated
by
what
congress
--
the
avoidance
of
tax
that
it
was
motivated
by
something
else
and
that
if
we
adopt
the
a
purpose
test,
i
--
mr.
richard
l.
braunstein
you
never
get
to
that
but
on
the
other
hand,
the
reasonable
needs
of
the
business
have
been
construed
by
the
regulation
and
the
courts
and
then
the
instruction
to
be
fixed
definite.
and
there
are
many
taxpayers
if
they
do
want
to
go
on
an
expansion
program
at
the
end
of
any
particular
year.
it's
maybe
completely
fortuitous
that
they
have
advanced
to
this
stay.
and
what
we're
saying
is
that
if
you
accept
the
government's
interpretation
in
effect
you're
just
preventing
a
taxpayer
whose
legitimate
purpose
is
the
expansion
and
diversification
of
his
business
from
pursuing
that
point
of
view.
mr.
richard
l.
braunstein
well,
i
--
mr.
richard
l.
braunstein
well,
i
think
the
spiritual
thrust
of
the
regulation
in
going
back
historically
was
to
get
at
corporations
that
the
primary
purpose
was
the
formation
for
matters
not
germane
to
the
corporate
function
but
to
tax
avoidance.
i
think
that
really
is
the
thrust.
and
what
we're
saying
here
is
that
this
interpretation
is
not
inconsistent
with
that
thrust.
what
it
does
is
permit
the
closely
held
corporation
to
compete
with
the
public
corporation.
and
in
no
way
do
i
view
the
test
enunciated
by
the
sixth
circuit
as
inconsistent
with
his
basic
purpose.
i
think
the
second
circuit
recognize
the
fact
that
this
statute
should
not
be
construed
in
consistent
with
the
antitrust
laws
that
it
recognize
that
the
philosophy
of
congress,
i
think
rather
than
being
hindered
by
the
interpretation
of
the
sixth
circuit
has
actually
helped.
because
i
think
it
is
consistent
with
permitting
competition
and
permitting
that
closely
held
corporation
to
compete.
we
are
not
arguing
for
a
standard
which
permits
tax
avoidance.
we're
arguing
for
a
standard
which
permits
the
closely
held
corporation
to
compete
with
the
public
company
to
diversify
and
expand
and
to
that
extent,
i
submit
it
is
completely
consistent
with
the
congressional
purpose
of
the
statute.
mr.
richard
l.
braunstein
that's
correct.
their
position
is
that
as
i
understand
that
that
a
statute
applies
if
a
purpose
was
the
avoidance
of
tax
and
the
way
to
test
a
purpose
is
that
if
an
individual
knows
the
distribution
will
result
in
taxable
income.
mr.
richard
l.
braunstein
it's
a
purpose.
mr.
richard
l.
braunstein
no,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
richard
l.
braunstein
and
our
position
is
that
you're
really
writing
out
the
statute.
you
might
as
well
under
then
interpretation
just
have
a
statute
which
says
that
if
there
is
an
accumulation
beyond
the
reasonable
needs
of
the
business
the
tax
applies
period
because
if
you
accept
that
interpretation,
the
rest
is
just
surplusage.
i
can't
see
any
meaning
for
it
all.
mr.
richard
l.
braunstein
under
the
statute?
mr.
richard
l.
braunstein
i
think
motive
--
mr.
richard
l.
braunstein
that's
correct.
the
motive
with
only
be
important
on
the
avoidance
of
the
purpose
test
and
it's
our
position
that
the
proper
instruction
is
that
the
motive
resulting
in
a
substantial
penalty
should
be
the
motive
controlling
the
actions
of
the
taxpayer.
mr.
richard
l.
braunstein
i
don't
think
--
i
think
ultimately
it's
a
jury
or
a
court
question.
i
think
it
first
blush
the
revenuation
does
come
in
and
make
the
determination
as
to
whether
the
accumulation
was
reasonable
or
unreasonable
in
terms
of
the
defying
standard.
mr.
richard
l.
braunstein
i
think
it
is.
mr.
richard
l.
braunstein
i
think
--
i'm
not
suggesting
that
it's
an
easy
test
but
the
court
has
done
it
in
the
allen
v.
trust
company
of
georgia
case
involving
transfers
and
contemplation
of
death.
this
court
did
it
in
duberstein
in
terms
of
what
is
a
gift
when
it
searched.
i
think
in
duberstein,
the
court
refused
to
come
up
with
an
easy
test
but
said,
“you've
got
to
search
for
dominant,
controlling,
and
impelling
motive.”
and
we're
asking
the
court
or
this
test
presents
no
more
of
a
difficulty
then
this
court
does
addressed
itself
to
in
duberstein
and
trust
company
of
georgia
where
it
did
accept
the
dominant
and
impelling
test.
mr.
richard
l.
braunstein
i
think
it's
required
under
the
statute.
mr.
richard
l.
braunstein
yes,
i
do
sir.
mr.
richard
l.
braunstein
i
think
our
experience
quite
frankly
would
be
and
most
tax
practitioners
have
focused
everything
in
trying
to
convince
the
trier
of
the
fact.
mr.
richard
l.
braunstein
that
it
is
an
unreasonable
but
you
then
get
into
a
very
difficult
question
if
the
courts
restrict
what
is
reasonable
and
what
is
not
that
you
only
have
one
last
refuge.
and
what
really
concerns
us
--
mr.
richard
l.
braunstein
well,
we
think
it's
more
substantial
in
terms
of
the
possibility
of
the
closely
held
company
--
mr.
richard
l.
braunstein
it
would
not
--
it
would
not
--that's
correct.
mr.
richard
l.
braunstein
we
say
it's
a
small
price
to
pay
for
a
competitive
society.
thank
you.
mr.
richard
l.
braunstein
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
before
this
court
is
the
construction
of
the
statute
that's
been
on
the
books
for
many,
many
years
since
1913.
the
statute
as
enacted
at
that
time
provided
that
a
corporation
formed
or
fraudulently
availed
of
for
the
purpose
of
preventing
tax
on
the
shareholders
would
trigger
a
penalty
tax
on
the
shareholder
at
that
time.
there
was
a
rebuttable
presumption
then
as
there
is
now
that
if
earnings
were
permitted
to
accumulate
beyond
the
reasonable
needs
of
the
business
that
this
was
prima
facie
evidence
for
the
purpose
to
escape
the
tax.
the
statute
has
been
amended
throughout
the
years,
the
word
fraudulently
was
excised.
the
tax
is
now
imposed
on
the
corporation
rather
than
the
shareholders
and
instead
of
a
prima
facie
evidence
or
rebuttable
presumption,
we
have
a
virtual
determinative
assumption
and
once
a
corporation
accumulates
its
earnings
beyond
its
reasonable
needs
that
unless
the
taxpayer
can
come
forward
and
determinatively
show
otherwise
that
the
penalty
applies.
mr.
richard
l.
braunstein
i
think
there
was
the
question
that
under
common
law,
it
was
very
difficult
to
establish
fraud
and
that
was
the
reason
that
was
struck
out.
the
reason
that
the
tax
was
then
imposed
on
the
shareholder,
it
was
first
imposed
on
the
shareholders
then
it
was
thought
perhaps
that
it
was
first
imposed
on
the
corporate
shareholder
and
then
on
a
corporation,
that
was
a
constitutional
question
involved.
but
i
think
the
purpose
going
into
the
statute
that
reading
the
early
cases
is
that
there
are
a
lot
of
holding
company
cases
involved
here.
at
the
time
the
statute
was
enacted,
there
was
no
corporate
tax,
taxpayers
were
permitted
to
deal
with
their
corporation
in
situations
which
would
lead
to
tax
avoidance
and
what
happened
many
taxpayers
were
able
to,
who
had
stocks
and
securities
in
receiving
income
on
that
were
able
to
put
it
in
a
corporate
shell
and
really
isolate
themselves,
and
insulate
themselves
from
any
taxes.
in
addition,
the
taxpayer
was
permitted
to
sell
stock
which
he
had
purchased
to
his
corporation
and
if
you
realize
the
laws
on
that,
he
could
take
it
and
i
think
if
this
came
up,
this
case
came
up
in
1913,
we
can
make
a
very
strong
argument
that
the
purpose
required
was
the
sole
purpose
and
that
the
court
used
the
word
formed
fraudulently
because
it
was
talking
about
a
situation
where
a
corporation
was
used
in
a
fraudulent
manner,
in
a
manner
inconsistent
as
what
we
deemed
to
be
the
normal
use
of
a
corporation.
and
i
think
have
this
case
come
up,
we
could
say
that
the
case,
the
statute
would
only
apply
if
there
was
absolutely
no
reason,
no
valid
reason
that
the
sole
purpose
for
the
shareholder
of
forming
this
corporation
had
to
be
tax
avoidance.
mr.
richard
l.
braunstein
the
sole
valid
--
well,
that
the
sole
purpose
for
the
corporation,
there
was
no
business
reason
that
before
the
penalty
was
to
apply,
the
court
would
have
to
find
that
the
sole
and
only
purpose
of
forming
the
corporation
was
--
mr.
richard
l.
braunstein
i
think
basically
coming
down
to
our
test
and
what
the
sixth
circuit
has
really
assigned
is
that
once
it
shown
that
the
accumulation
is
beyond
the
objective
reasonable
needs
of
the
business
and
that
phrase
has
tremendous
significance,
that's
been
determined
as
fixed,
definite,
certain
plans.
almost
balance
sheet
liabilities
and
written
commitments.
now,
once
the
taxpayer
has
accumulated
beyond
that,
and
the
fact
that
he
says,
“well,
my
purpose
is
really
i'd
like
to
expand.
i'd
like
to
acquire
but
i
just
can't
go
out
and
buy
a
newspaper
or
a
radio
station
or
a
cement
plant.
it's
just
impossible.
i'm
looking.”
the
position
of
the
government
today
is
that
you
have
--
you're
out
of
the
ball
game
and
the
reason
they
say
that
is
they
say
what
is
the
a
purpose
test?
how
do
we
determine
that?
well,
it's
very
simple,
they
say
if
the
shareholder
is
subject
to
taxable
income,
he's
in
a
tax
bracket,
he
has
no
operating
law
as
carryovers
and
he
has
been
advised
that
a
distribution
would
result
in
taxable
income.
well,
that's
all
you
have
to
show
because
then
it
follows
that
accumulating
results
in
an
avoidance
of
the
tax
which
is
true.
mr.
richard
l.
braunstein
and
the
avoidance
is
the
purpose.
there's
--
even
though
he
might
--
mr.
richard
l.
braunstein
it
isn't.
i
think
the
government
concedes,
he
might
have
100
purposes
and
that
you
might
be
talking
about
tax
avoidance
or
the
tax
purpose
might
be
incident,
remote,
he
would
not
really
care
about
it
but
the
tax
applies,
that's
the
government's
position.
they
say,
if
it's
one
out
of
100
reasons,
the
tax
applies.
basically,
if
you
take
that
approach
--
mr.
richard
l.
braunstein
it's
impossible,
you
can't
do
it.
the
only
two
situations
that
i
could
think
of
is
that
if
you
have
a
net
operating
loss
carryover,
we
can
show
the
distribution
--
mr.
richard
l.
braunstein
--
will
not
result
in
any
income.
or
in
the
other
situation
where
someone
has
just
completely
and
honestly
ignorant
and
had
not
been
advised
but
these
are
--
it
just
doesn't
happen.
and
i
think
the
whole
point
of
the
government's
position
is
really
not
asking
for
a
construction
of
the
statute.
i
mean
you
can
forget
about
availed
of
for
purpose.
what
the
government's
position
in
effect
of
saying
is
that
if
you
accumulate
beyond
fixed
definite
and
reasonable
needs;
forget
about
it
if
you
are
a
closely
held
corporation.
and
we
think
that
at
least
that
a
small
businessman
should
have
the
opportunity
to
try
to
rebut
this
presumption.
now,
the
sixth
circuit
isn't
giving
anything
here.
i
mean,
when
you
talk
about
it,
the
burden,
that's
the
determinative
burden
which
this
taxpayer
has
to
show
that
the
tax
avoidance
was
not
the
dominant
or
impelling
motive.
well,
he
just
can't
sit
up
there
and
say,
“well,
that
wasn't
my
motive.”
he's
got
to
be
fairly
specific
and
concrete
in
what
he's
saying
and
i
think
that
the
thing
that
really
disturbs
us
about
this
case
is
you're
really
preventing
expansion
of
the
smaller
corporation.
i
just
can't
see
how
he
could
expand
under
the
government's
interpretation.
mr.
richard
l.
braunstein
i
think
he
could
sir,
yes.
but
he'd
be
at
a
tremendous
disadvantage
on
the
publicly
held
companies.
i
think
you've
got
a
reverse
twist
justice.
i
think
perhaps
1913,
when
this
statute
was
enacted,
the
business
was
held
and
closely
held
family
groups
and
they
represented
the
substantial
and
economic
power
in
this
country.
i
think
things
have
changed
where
the
substantial
economic
powers
in
the
publicly
held
corporations
with
a
statute
which
was
aimed
at
the
power,
the
economic
power
is
now
being
applied
against
the
little
men
and
the
persons
that
it
was
intended
to
cover
initially
are
just
not
being
covered
at
this
particular
time.
and
i
think
basically,
our
position
here
is
that
simple
that
what
the
government
asked
is
not
a
construction
of
the
statute.
there
is
no
construction,
there
is
no
statute
and
we
think
the
only
real
tenable
and
reasonable
view
is
the
position
of
the
sixth
circuit.
mr.
richard
l.
braunstein
may
it
please
the
court.
i
believe
the
impression
was
left
yesterday
that
a
taxpayer
in
this
case
accumulated
a
substantial
amount
of
funds
and
the
sole
purpose
was
the
avoidance
of
tax
but
that
was
not
the
decision
of
the
court
below.
the
first
inquiry
is
whether
the
accumulation
exceeds
the
reasonable
needs
of
taxpayer's
business.
but
this
phrase
has
come
to
me
in
the
fixed,
definite,
and
certain
needs
of
the
business
or
written
obligation
of
the
taxpayer.
it's
a
test
which
the
government
has
tried
to
restrict
as
closely
as
possible.
mr.
richard
l.
braunstein
i
think
you're
correct.
mr.
richard
l.
braunstein
that's
correct.
this
issue
is
not
before
the
court
but
i
think
it's
pertinent
in
terms
of
the
effect
of
what
the
government
proposes
to
ask
this
court
to
set
the
test
because
in
circumstances
like
this,
the
jury
found
that
the
taxpayer
did
not
have
fixed
and
definite
purposes
but
they
held
that
he
did
not
have
a
tax
avoidance
purpose.
the
taxpayer
stated
that
he
had
plans
for
expansion,
he
intended
to
buy
stock
in
a
distributor
and
the
theory
we
can
infer
believe
that
this
was
the
purpose
motivating
his
conduct.
so,
while
it
was
not
fixed,
definite,
and
certain,
nevertheless,
it
was
a
permissible
purpose
and
the
facts
were
that
the
taxpayer
did
purchase
$380,000.00
worth
of
the
distributor's
stock
that
the
taxpayer
did
expand
and
it
was
because
of
this
expansion
and
purchase
that
the
taxpayers
continue
to
be
successful
but
the
critical
point
is
that
it's
the
government's
position
that
in
adopting
the
a
purpose
test,
you
would
then
ask
the
taxpayer
only
two
questions.
number
one,
if
the
distribution
was
made
to
you
would
it
be
taxable?
number
two,
were
you
aware
that
if
a
distribution
was
made
to
you
it
would
be
taxable?
and
if
both
of
those
answers
were
yes,
then
it's
my
understanding
that
regardless
of
the
fact
that
taxpayer's
purpose
is
dominant
purpose
the
whole
purpose
of
the
accumulation
was
for
expansion
to
preserve
and
expand
the
business
that
nevertheless
the
penalty
would
apply.
mr.
richard
l.
braunstein
i
haven't
heard
them
deny
that
characterization.
mr.
richard
l.
braunstein
that's
not
--
mr.
richard
l.
braunstein
i
don't
regard
that
that
is
what
the
government
is
asking
this
court
to
rule
on.
i
think
they
say
very
clearly
that
if
the
avoidance
of
tax
is
one
of
100
purposes
regardless
of
its
significance
then
the
tax
applies
and
how
do
you
determine
what
do
you
mean
by
avoidance
of
tax?
well,
avoidance
of
tax
is
knowledge
that
a
distribution
results
in
taxable
income
and
the
whole
thrust
of
the
government's
argument
and
our
argument
here
is
such
a
test
really
rights
out
the
purpose
test
because
this
--
mr.
richard
l.
braunstein
i
think
that
is
correct
and
it's
basically
our
position
that
the
sixth
circuit
correctly
characterized
the
test
in
terms
of
the
dominant
and
impelling
motive.
it's
--
i
think
one
of
the
difficult
things
is
the
burden
of
proof
that
the
taxpayer
has
and
if
you
enunciate
a
test
other
than
the
dominant
or
impelling
test
whether
it
has
any
meaning
because
once
the
court
finds
that
an
accumulation
is
beyond
the
objectively
reasonable
needs
of
the
business
we're
face
or
the
taxpayer
is
face
with
a
determinative
presumption.
he
has
to
go
forward
and
prove
in
very
heavy
burden
that
this
was
not
the
purpose.
he
obviously
cannot
say,
“well,
that
was
not
my
purpose.
i
don't
think
that
carries
the
burden.”
i
think
he's
compelled
to
give
specific
and
definite
reasons
as
it
relates
to
his
motivation.
now,
as
a
practical
matter,
these
cases
are
tried
four
or
five
years
after
the
year
in
issue
and
he
cannot
fabricate.
i
--
i
think
there
is
--
the
government
is
concerned
about
that
these
are
subjective
matters
that
there
is
no
objective
way
to
determine
or
test
the
testimony
of
the
taxpayer.
but
this
is
not
true.
he's
talking
about
a
situation
of
his
intentions
of
his
plans
and
we're
viewing
these
four
or
five
years
after
and
he
--
when
he
says
must
be
susceptible
to
objective
verification
or
reason.
and
it's
out
position
that
it's
only
through
utilization
of
the
dominant
or
impelling
test
that
there
is
any
meaning
in
the
phrase
avoidance
of
the
purpose
that
any
other
test
just
puts
an
impossible
burden
on
the
taxpayer
and
i
think
this
is
why
we
believe
the
government's
position
and
i
think
it's
very
clear
when
i
say,
“one
out
of
100.”
that's
enough
to
carry
today.
that
is
their
position.
mr.
richard
l.
braunstein
i
don't
gather
that
from
the
record.
i
think
the
government's
position
in
a
purpose
that
if
avoidance
of
the
taxes
a
purpose.
mr.
richard
l.
braunstein
i
think
the
jury
would
have
to
find
additional
--
mr.
richard
l.
braunstein
yes.
mr.
richard
l.
braunstein
unreasonable
and
our
point
is
that
--
mr.
richard
l.
braunstein
no,
i
don't
think
that's
true.
when
you
talk
about
the
unreasonable
means
of
the
business,
that
phrase
has
been
determined
as
requiring
fixed,
definite,
and
certain
needs,
something
that
is
susceptible
to
a
knowledge
that
this
is
going
to
require
a
liability.
now,
if
the
court
if
we
had
a
more
liberal
view
of
the
unreasonable
--
mr.
richard
l.
braunstein
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
l.
braunstein
i
think
it's
--
mr.
richard
l.
braunstein
i
would
think
so
because
one
of
the
things
that
concerns
me
or
disturbs
me
is
that
in
testing
what
is
unreasonable.
that's
not
a
very
broad
test.
it's
rather
limited
and
i
think
the
whole
thrust
of
our
argument
in
terms
of
the
unreasonable
test
--
mr.
richard
l.
braunstein
i
think
if
it
were
not
i
think
you'd
have
fewer
cases
going
on
the
purpose
test.
i
think
what
you
really
getting
here
is
expansion
problem.
the
taxpayer
that
intends
to
expand
desires
to
diversify
but
under
the
unreasonable
test
cannot
satisfy
it
because
he
does
not
his
plans
have
not
matured
to
the
state
required
by
the
statute.
and
our
position
is
in
view
of
the
fact
that
this
is
what
the
unreasonable
test
is
to
then
adopt
in
--
purpose
test
precludes
a
taxpayer
from
expanding.
mr.
richard
l.
braunstein
correct.
i
think
what
we're
saying
that
whatever
his
motivation
is
he's
not
looking
to
avoid
tax
but
he
honestly
believes
that
--
mr.
richard
l.
braunstein
well,
i
agree
with
you
and
i
think
they
are
very
difficult
standards
and
what
we're
saying
is
that
in
the
government's
view
to
adopt
an
a
purpose
test
really
writes
out
any
opportunity
of
the
taxpayer
to
attempt
to
meet
that
standard.
mr.
richard
l.
braunstein
i
view
that
really
as
a
burden
of
proof
aspect
that
congress
created
making
it
most
difficult
for
the
taxpayer
once
a
determination
has
been
made
that
the
accumulation
exceeds
the
“reasonable
needs”
of
the
business
that
a
very
difficult
burden
is
placed
on
the
taxpayer.
and
in
terms,
the
taxpayer
then
has
--
is
given
one
last
opportunity
as
i
view
it
to
show
that
his
conduct
was
not
motivated
by
what
congress
--
the
avoidance
of
tax
that
it
was
motivated
by
something
else
and
that
if
we
adopt
the
a
purpose
test,
i
--
mr.
richard
l.
braunstein
you
never
get
to
that
but
on
the
other
hand,
the
reasonable
needs
of
the
business
have
been
construed
by
the
regulation
and
the
courts
and
then
the
instruction
to
be
fixed
definite.
and
there
are
many
taxpayers
if
they
do
want
to
go
on
an
expansion
program
at
the
end
of
any
particular
year.
it's
maybe
completely
fortuitous
that
they
have
advanced
to
this
stay.
and
what
we're
saying
is
that
if
you
accept
the
government's
interpretation
in
effect
you're
just
preventing
a
taxpayer
whose
legitimate
purpose
is
the
expansion
and
diversification
of
his
business
from
pursuing
that
point
of
view.
mr.
richard
l.
braunstein
well,
i
--
mr.
richard
l.
braunstein
well,
i
think
the
spiritual
thrust
of
the
regulation
in
going
back
historically
was
to
get
at
corporations
that
the
primary
purpose
was
the
formation
for
matters
not
germane
to
the
corporate
function
but
to
tax
avoidance.
i
think
that
really
is
the
thrust.
and
what
we're
saying
here
is
that
this
interpretation
is
not
inconsistent
with
that
thrust.
what
it
does
is
permit
the
closely
held
corporation
to
compete
with
the
public
corporation.
and
in
no
way
do
i
view
the
test
enunciated
by
the
sixth
circuit
as
inconsistent
with
his
basic
purpose.
i
think
the
second
circuit
recognize
the
fact
that
this
statute
should
not
be
construed
in
consistent
with
the
antitrust
laws
that
it
recognize
that
the
philosophy
of
congress,
i
think
rather
than
being
hindered
by
the
interpretation
of
the
sixth
circuit
has
actually
helped.
because
i
think
it
is
consistent
with
permitting
competition
and
permitting
that
closely
held
corporation
to
compete.
we
are
not
arguing
for
a
standard
which
permits
tax
avoidance.
we're
arguing
for
a
standard
which
permits
the
closely
held
corporation
to
compete
with
the
public
company
to
diversify
and
expand
and
to
that
extent,
i
submit
it
is
completely
consistent
with
the
congressional
purpose
of
the
statute.
mr.
richard
l.
braunstein
that's
correct.
their
position
is
that
as
i
understand
that
that
a
statute
applies
if
a
purpose
was
the
avoidance
of
tax
and
the
way
to
test
a
purpose
is
that
if
an
individual
knows
the
distribution
will
result
in
taxable
income.
mr.
richard
l.
braunstein
it's
a
purpose.
mr.
richard
l.
braunstein
no,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
richard
l.
braunstein
and
our
position
is
that
you're
really
writing
out
the
statute.
you
might
as
well
under
then
interpretation
just
have
a
statute
which
says
that
if
there
is
an
accumulation
beyond
the
reasonable
needs
of
the
business
the
tax
applies
period
because
if
you
accept
that
interpretation,
the
rest
is
just
surplusage.
i
can't
see
any
meaning
for
it
all.
mr.
richard
l.
braunstein
under
the
statute?
mr.
richard
l.
braunstein
i
think
motive
--
mr.
richard
l.
braunstein
that's
correct.
the
motive
with
only
be
important
on
the
avoidance
of
the
purpose
test
and
it's
our
position
that
the
proper
instruction
is
that
the
motive
resulting
in
a
substantial
penalty
should
be
the
motive
controlling
the
actions
of
the
taxpayer.
mr.
richard
l.
braunstein
i
don't
think
--
i
think
ultimately
it's
a
jury
or
a
court
question.
i
think
it
first
blush
the
revenuation
does
come
in
and
make
the
determination
as
to
whether
the
accumulation
was
reasonable
or
unreasonable
in
terms
of
the
defying
standard.
mr.
richard
l.
braunstein
i
think
it
is.
mr.
richard
l.
braunstein
i
think
--
i'm
not
suggesting
that
it's
an
easy
test
but
the
court
has
done
it
in
the
allen
v.
trust
company
of
georgia
case
involving
transfers
and
contemplation
of
death.
this
court
did
it
in
duberstein
in
terms
of
what
is
a
gift
when
it
searched.
i
think
in
duberstein,
the
court
refused
to
come
up
with
an
easy
test
but
said,
“you've
got
to
search
for
dominant,
controlling,
and
impelling
motive.”
and
we're
asking
the
court
or
this
test
presents
no
more
of
a
difficulty
then
this
court
does
addressed
itself
to
in
duberstein
and
trust
company
of
georgia
where
it
did
accept
the
dominant
and
impelling
test.
mr.
richard
l.
braunstein
i
think
it's
required
under
the
statute.
mr.
richard
l.
braunstein
yes,
i
do
sir.
mr.
richard
l.
braunstein
i
think
our
experience
quite
frankly
would
be
and
most
tax
practitioners
have
focused
everything
in
trying
to
convince
the
trier
of
the
fact.
mr.
richard
l.
braunstein
that
it
is
an
unreasonable
but
you
then
get
into
a
very
difficult
question
if
the
courts
restrict
what
is
reasonable
and
what
is
not
that
you
only
have
one
last
refuge.
and
what
really
concerns
us
--
mr.
richard
l.
braunstein
well,
we
think
it's
more
substantial
in
terms
of
the
possibility
of
the
closely
held
company
--
mr.
richard
l.
braunstein
it
would
not
--
it
would
not
--that's
correct.
mr.
richard
l.
braunstein
we
say
it's
a
small
price
to
pay
for
a
competitive
society.
thank
you.
