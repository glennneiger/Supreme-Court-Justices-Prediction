mr.
casey,
do
you
believe
if
this
matter
had
been
specifically
presented
to
the
congress
that
the
congress
would
have
said
in
these
circumstances,
you
are
entitled
to
take
a
double
27.5%
depletion
allowance?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
i
didn't
ask
you
that.
i
asked
you
if
it
had
been
specifically
presented
to
them
and
discussed
in
their
committees.
so
do
you
think
that
they
would
have
arrived
at
any
such
conclusion?
chief

would
you
tell

why

of

ask
you

that
lead
you
to
the
conclusion
that
this
is
not
a
double
taking?
