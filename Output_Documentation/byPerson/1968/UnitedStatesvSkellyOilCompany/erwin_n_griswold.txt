mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
federal
tax
case
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit.
although
it
is
a
tax
case,
it
is
a
sequel
or
consequence
of
a
decision
rendered
by
this
court
in
1958
in
wisconsin
pipeline
company
against
the
corporation
commission
of
oklahoma
where
this
court
held
that
the
corporation
commission
of
oklahoma
had
no
power
to
fix
minimum
rates
for
the
sale
of
gas.
the
respondent
taxpayer
here
produces
and
sells
natural
gas.
during
the
years
1952
through
1957,
it
charged
its
customers,
those
increased
rates
pursuant
to
the
order
of
the
oklahoma
corporations
commission.
naturally,
the
amounts
which
it
received
were
income
to
it.
they
entered
into
the
computation
of
the
“gross
income
from
the
property”
against
which
it
took
in
each
of
those
years,
1952
to
1957
a
deduction
of
27.5%
as
percentage
depletion
pursuant
to
section
613
of
the
internal
revenue
code.
there's
no
doubt
that
it
was
entitled
to
this
deduction
for
depletion
as
it
clearly
receive
the
gross
income
under
a
claim
of
right
that
the
statute
provided
that
where
income
is
received
from
oil
and
gas,
there
is
a
depletion
deduction.
a
taxpayer
has
his
option
to
take
either
cost
depletion
or
percentage
depletion.
in
this
case,
percentage
depletion
was
advantageous
and
that
was
what
was
taken.
following
this
court's
decision
in
the
pipeline
case,
and
the
respondent
was
sued
by
several
of
its
customers
on
the
ground
that
they
had
been
overcharged.
and
it
promptly
having
no
defense
to
that
case
in
1958,
it
settled
that
controversy
with
two
of
them
and
paid
to
them
an
aggregate
of
$505,536.00
in
1958
and
it
is
the
company's
tax
year
1958
and
only
that
year
which
is
before
the
court.
the
question
is
the
consequence
or
the
way
in
which
it
should
be
treated
of
that
repayment
made
in
1958.
the
taxpayer
deducted
the
repayment
in
full.
we
say
that
the
deduction
allowed
in
1958
should
be
reduced
by
the
amounts
previously
allowed
as
deductions
for
percentage
depletion
in
the
years
1952
through
1957,
that
is
by
27.5%
and
that
is
the
issue
to
which
i
will
return
after
the
recess.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
as
i
was
saying
before
the
recess,
this
case
involves
two
payments
aggregating
$505,000.00
made
by
the
respondent
in
1958
which
represented
repayments
of
excess
charges
for
gas
which
it
had
sold
in
the
years
1952
through
1957
for
which
it
had
received
payment
and
against
which
payments
it
had
deducted
the
statutory
percentage
depletion
in
the
amount
of
27.5%.
taxpayer's
contention
is
that
it
is
entitled
to
deduct
the
entire
amount
of
the
repayments
made
in
1958
despite
the
fact
that
depletion
had
already
been
deducted
with
respect
to
them.
there
is
some
discussion
in
the
briefs
as
to
whether
this
deduction
is
under
the
deduction
for
a
loss
or
the
deduction
for
business
expense
as
suggestion
made
that
the
government
has
changed
its
ground
on
that.
i
do
not
think
that
that
is
the
case.
the
stipulation
in
the
matter
on
page
18,
the
last
line
of
the
page
in
the
appendix
simply
says
that
they
took
a
deduction
but
i
spend
no
time
on
this
because
i
do
not
think
it
is
important
or
of
any
consequence
in
any
event.
the
district
court
agreed
with
the
government's
argument
and
entered
judgment
for
the
government
based
on
the
position
that
the
deduction
for
1958
should
be
reduced
by
the
amount
of
percentage
depletion
which
had
already
been
allowed
as
a
deduction
with
respect
to
the
payments.
on
appeal,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit
reversed.
it
then
granted
the
government's
petition
for
rehearing
but
after
the
rehearing,
the
court
adhered
to
its
earlier
decision
by
a
two-to-one
vote,
judge
hill
writing
an
extensive
dissenting
opinion.
now,
with
respect
to
the
law,
i
think
that
it
can
fairly
be
said
that
what
is
really
involved
here
is
basic
questions
of
proper
tax
accounting
and
it
was
because
of
the
undesirability
of
having
clear
principles
already
established
by
this
court
made
confusing
that
we
felt
that
it
was
important
to
seek
a
review
here.
the
case
also
involves
section
1341
of
the
internal
revenue
code
and
i'll
turn
to
that
in
a
moment.
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
though
that
even
though
section
1341
must
be
considered,
the
proper
conclusion
is
that
on
consideration,
one
could
come
to
the
conclusion
that
section
1341
is
in
fact
bypassed
in
this
case
and
that
the
case
should
be
decided
exactly
as
it
would
be
decided
if
section
1341
had
never
been
enacted.
now,
the
relevant
portion
of
section
1341
is
set
out
on
pages
10
and
11
of
our
brief.
it
is
also
in
the
appendix
to
both
briefs
of
elsewhere
but
looking
at
page
10
of
the
government's
brief,
we
find
that
it
starts
out
with
if
and
then
there
are
five
numbered
paragraphs.
the
first
three
are
conditions
to
the
application
of
the
section
and
i
would
point
out
that
paragraph
1
says,
if
an
item,
and
i
would
call
attention
to
those
words,
“an
item
was
included
in
gross
income
for
a
prior
taxable
year
or
years
because
it
appears
that
a
taxpayer
have
an
unrestrictive
right
to
such
item.”
now
that's
the
payments
which
the
respondent
receives
in
the
year
1952
to
1957.
two,
a
deduction
--
now,
i
call
your
attention
to
the
fact
that
that
is
not
the
same
word.
it
is
a
different
word.
it
does
not
follow
that
the
deduction
is
in
the
same
amount
as
the
item.
the
deduction
is
whatever
is
the
appropriate
amount
of
deduction.
in
the
light
of
the
fact
that
an
item
was
received
“a
deduction
is
allowable
for
the
taxable
year
because
it
was
established
after
the
close
of
such
prior
taxable
year
or
years,
that
the
taxpayer
does
not
have
an
unrestrictive
right
to
such
item
or
to
a
portion
of
such
item”
and
that
condition
is
met
here.
and
three,
“the
amount
of
such
deduction
exceeds
$3000.00.”
that
condition
is
met.
then
the
tax
imposed
by
this
chapter
for
the
taxable
year
shall
be
the
lesser
of
the
following
and
now
there
are
the
two-numbered
paragraphs
4
and
5.
i
think
it's
convenient
to
say
the
taxpayer
has
his
option
of
proceeding
under
one
or
the
other.
actually,
the
statute
says
that
the
tax
shall
be
the
lesser
of
these
two.
four,
the
tax
for
the
taxable
year
computed
with
such
deduction
and
you'll
notice,
the
deduction
goes
back
to
the
item
in
the
word
in
paragraph
2
or
5,
and
5
is
barely
long
but
it
says,
in
substance
that
the
other
matter
which
is
to
be
computed
in
determining
which
is
the
lesser
is
in
effect
to
take
the
amount
out
of
the
prior
taxable
year
reducing
the
taxes
for
this
year
by
the
taxes
which
were
as
it
now
develops
improperly
paid
in
the
earlier
year.
now,
the
fact
is
that
section
1341
(a)
(5),
the
language
on
page
11
of
the
government's
brief
was
not
utilized
by
the
taxpayer
here.
this
case
arises
with
respect
to
section
1341
(a)
(4)
which
provides
the
tax
for
the
taxable
year
computed
with
such
deduction
is
the
amount
which
is
to
be
taken
into
account
and
i
suggest
that
that
leaves
the
situation
exactly
where
it
would
have
been
if
section
1341
had
never
been
enacted
because
the
tax
for
the
taxable
year
would
be
computed
with
such
deduction
prior
to
the
enactment
of
section
1341.
the
taxpayer
here
has
simply
found
it
desirable
not
to
use
the
relief
which
section
1341
provided
through
paragraph
5
because
that
would
have
been
less
advantageous
to
get
at
its
claim
under
paragraph
(a)
(4)
and
interestingly
enough,
this
was
expressly
recognized
by
the
court
below
in
its
first
opinion.
this
is
on
page
42
of
the
appendix
in
judge
seay's
opinion
beginning
the
first
full
paragraph
on
that
page,
“thus,
it
appears
that
congress
by
section
1341
enacted
the
existing
rule
as
to
current
year
deductions
and
added
another
provision.”
but
1341
(a)
(4)
is
simply
the
existing
rule,
the
rule
that
would
have
been
applicable
if
1341
have
never
been
passed
and
then
later
in
the
same
paragraph,
a
little
below
the
middle
of
the
paragraph,
“thus,
it
must
be
concluded
that
congress
sought
to
make
no
change
in
the
current
year
deduction
remedy
but
only
added
the
recomputation
provision.”
and
in
our
view,
the
court
was
thoroughly
sound
in
saying
that
but
simply
did
not
pursue
it
through
to
its
conclusion
because
the
majority
of
the
court
below
reached
its
result
in
effect
by
construing
section
1341
and
saying
that
the
word
deduction
in
those
several
provisions
must
be
read
as
having
the
same
meaning
as
the
word
“item”
in
paragraph
1.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
mr.
justice,
i
think
it
is
clear
and
i
hope
that
it
will
be
after
this
court
has
decided
this
case.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
at
the
present
time,
it
is
somewhat
clouded
by
the
decision
of
the
tenth
circuit
but
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
didn't
choose
paragraph
5
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
which
would
have
meant
throwing
it
back
into
the
earlier
year
and
reducing
the
tax
for
this
year
by
the
amount
of
tax
which
it
paid.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
mr.
justice.
paragraph
5
might
have
been
very
advantageous
to
them
suppose
for
example
they
have
had
a
lost
in
1958
then
they
would
want
to
use
paragraph
5.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
suppose
they
had
had
a
smaller
loss
or
putting
it
another
way,
section
1341
is
very
much
a
consequence
of
this
court's
decision
in
the
arrowsmith
case.
the
arrowsmith
case
involved
a
situation
where
the
taxpayer
received
an
amount
in
liquidation
of
a
corporation
in
one
year
and
returned
that
as
income
as
a
capital
gain.
in
a
later
year,
it
was
required
to
make
a
payment
with
respect
to
that
on
the
ground
that
it
was
a
transferee
from
the
corporation
and
the
corporation
owed
money.
there
was
no
suggestion
that
they
were
not
entitled
to
deduct
the
amount
in
the
later
year.
the
only
question
in
the
arrowsmith
case
was
whether
the
deduction
was
as
a
capital
loss
or
as
an
ordinary
loss
and
this
court
held
that
since
the
repayment
in
the
later
year
arose
out
of
the
capital
transaction.
it
was
to
be
treated
as
a
capital
loss
and
that
is
a
case
which
we
think
supports
our
position
here
but
the
problem
which
it
presented
was
that
capital
losses
are
subject
to
superior
restriction
as
to
their
deductibility
and
they
might
have
included
the
amount
in
the
earlier
year
in
income
be
entitled
to
deduct
it
as
a
capital
loss
in
the
later
year
but
get
very
little
benefit
from
it,
and
it
was
for
that
reason
that
1341
(a)
(5)
was
enacted
to
say
that
if
they
got
little
benefit
from
it
in
the
later
year,
they
could
reduce
their
tax
for
the
later
year
by
the
amount
of
tax
which
they
paid
in
the
earlier
year.
you
also
get
similar
situations
where
there
are
changes
in
the
tax
rates.
in
this
particular
case,
the
tax
rates
were
exactly
the
same
in
each
year.
there
were
no
losses
that
affected
the
situation,
no
carryover,
so
that
the
only
reason
the
taxpayer
wanted
to
use
1341
(a)
(4)
was
because
it
thought
as
the
tenth
circuit
held
that
such
deduction
in
1341
(a)
(4)
meant
the
same
thing
as
the
item
or
an
item
in
1341
(a)
(1)
and
allowed
the
taxpayer
to
deduct
the
entire
amount
of
the
payment
despite
the
fact
that
27.5%
had
already
been
deducted
with
respect
to
the
same
payment.
now,
we
contend
that
that
is
wrong
as
a
matter
of
principle,
that
this
is
in
the
area
of
proper
tax
accounting
long
since
established
by
decisions
of
this
court
that
section
1341
was
wrongly
construed
by
the
court
below
and
that
when
it
is
rightly
construed,
it
leaves
the
well-known
decisions
of
this
court
in
full
operation
which
would
require
the
adjustment
for
which
the
government
contends.
now,
in
some
ways
the
closest
of
these
cases
is
one
that
was
decided
long
ago,
united
states
against
ludey,
decided
in
1927,
opinion
by
mr.
justice
brandeis
who
had
a
very
excellent
grasp
of
the
accounting
background
and
problems
in
this
area.
brief
for
the
united
states
was
written
in
the
time
of
solicitor
general
mitchell
and
i
was
much
interested
in
reading
that
brief
to
find
that
the
argument
which
he
then
made
is
essentially
the
argument
which
we
are
trying
to
present
here
and
it
is
the
argument
which
was
accepted
by
the
court.
the
ludey
case
involves
the
determination
of
the
amount
of
gain
on
the
sale
of
a
mining
property.
it
arose
with
respect
to
the
year
1917
which
was
before
there
was
any
provision
in
the
statute
providing
for
the
adjustment
of
basis
of
property
on
the
sale
of
property.
the
statute
provided
explicitly
that
the
basis
of
property
shall
be
its
cost
or
its
march
1,
1913
value.
in
that
case,
the
taxpayer
had
deducted
the
depreciation
on
its
machinery.
it
had
deducted
depletion
with
respect
to
its
oil
which
had
been
taken
out.
but
when
they
came
to
sell
the
property,
they
computed
their
loss
by
taking
the
full
cost
with
no
adjustment
for
the
depreciation
and
depletion
which
had
been
sustained
and
the
court
of
claims
supported
the
taxpayer
in
that
and
said
that
there
was
no
basis
in
the
statute
for
the
adjustment.
there
was
some
controversy
as
to
amount
of
the
adjustment
if
it
was
to
be
made
namely
whether
it
was
the
amount
which
the
taxpayer
had
actually
deducted
or
depletion
and
depreciation
or
whether
the
adjustment
to
basis
should
be
the
amount
which
they
could
have
deducted
if
they
had
taken
all
that
they
could
and
should
have
taken
and
this
court
in
the
opinion
by
justice
brandeis
and
let
me
emphasize
again
without
any
explicit
statutory
provision,
simply
as
a
matter
of
general
principles
of
tax
accounting,
held
that
in
computing
the
gain
or
loss
on
the
sale,
the
basis
must
be
adjusted
by
the
amount
of
depreciation
and
depletion
sustained
and
remanded
the
case
to
the
court
of
claims
to
determine
that
amount.
now
the
next
case
chronologically
which
provides
a
part
of
this
basis
for
determining
sound
principles
of
tax
accounting
is
charles
ilfeld
company
against
hernandez
in
292
u.s.
now
that
is
a
case
where
a
parent
company
had
some
subsidiaries
and
if
filed
consolidated
returns
with
those
subsidiaries.
the
subsidiaries
had
losses
in
nearly
all
of
the
years
involved
and
the
effect
of
the
consolidated
returns
was
that
the
subsidiary
losses
were
deducted
against
the
parent's
income
which
was
entirely
right
and
appropriate
as
the
function
of
consolidated
return.
but
in
the
year
1927
which
was
involved
in
that
case,
the
parent
liquidated
the
subsidiaries
and
since
the
subsidiaries
had
had
consistent
losses,
the
parent
got
very
little
out
of
the
subsidiaries
when
it
liquidated
them
and
it
sought
to
deduct
on
its
tax
return
the
amount
of
the
loss
which
it
sustained
on
the
liquidation
of
the
subsidiaries.
here
again,
there
was
nothing
in
the
statute
which
dealt
expressly
with
it.
there
was
a
statutory
provision
giving
the
commissioner
broad
power
to
make
regulations
in
this
area.
the
commissioner
had
made
regulations
but
none
of
them
really
quite
fit
this
particular
situation
and
in
the
ilfeld
case,
an
opinion
by
justice
butler,
the
court
held
that
the
loss
could
not
be
taken
because
in
the
court's
language
and
this
is
quoted
on
page
19
of
the
government's
brief.
if
allowed,
this
would
be
the
practical
equivalent
of
double
deduction.
and
that
of
course
is
exactly
the
situation
which
is
involved
here.
if
the
taxpayer
here
is
allowed
to
deduct
the
entire
amount
paid
in
1958,
it
will
with
respect
to
this
transaction
have
deducted
an
aggregate
of
127.5%
of
the
amount
paid
because
it
has
already
deducted
27.5%
as
percentage
depletion.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well
that
--
you
can
say
in
effect
that
they
have
deducted
27.5%
twice
with
respect
to
the
same
mineral.
this
is
a
little
complicated
to
answer
because
we're
dealing
with
percentage
depletion.
it
has
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
the
amount
that
was
lost
where
a
cost
depletion
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
depended
on
what
the
gross
income
for
mining
was
and
we
contend
that
the
505,000
repaid
in
1958
reduced
the
gross
income
from
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
as
it
now
turns
out,
the
depletion
allowance
in
the
prior
return
was
not
justified.
however,
under
decisions
of
this
court
like
arrowsmith,
without
section
1341,
you
don't
go
back
and
correct
the
earlier
year.
you
make
the
proper
correction
in
this
year
and
we
suggest
that
the
proper
adjustment
is
to
allow
the
deduction
the
$505,000.00
paid
less
27.5%
percentage
depletion
which
has
already
been
deducted.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
mr.
justice
that
is
pretty
close
to
the
taxpayer's
contention
in
this
case.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
seems
to
me
that
the
--
it
seems
to
me
to
begging
your
pardon
clearly
wrong.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
let
me
just
take
the
language.
1341
(a)
(4),
the
tax
for
the
taxable
year
computed
with
such
deduction,
that
doesn't
how
much?
it
just
says
“such
deduction.”
that
obviously
refers
back
to
1341
(a)
(2)
as
a
deduction.
now,
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
seems
to
me
that
in
the
statement
which
you
have
made,
you
have
taken
the
next
leap
which
is
to
say
that
a
deduction
means
in
this
case
$505,000.00
and
i
suggest
that
there's
nothing
in
1341
(a)
(2)
which
says
that
the
deduction
to
which
a
deduction
refers
is
$505,000.00.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
clearly,
it
does.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that's
the
amount
of
the
overpayment.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
because
i
think
that
a
deduction
does
not
have
the
same
meaning
as
the
words
“the
amount
repaid.”
it
does
not
have
the
same
meaning
as
the
word
“an
item”
in
paragraph
1.
now,
the
item
was
$505,000.00
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
was
what
was
taken
into
income.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
only
mr.
justice
if
you
take
the
position
which
i
think
is
not
warranted
that
the
deduction
referred
to
in
1341
(a)
(2)
is
the
same
in
amount
as
the
amount
of
the
item
which
was
paid
out
and
what
i
have
been
trying
to
suggest
is
that
the
amount
of
the
deduction
to
which
the
taxpayer
is
entitled,
under
cases
like
ludey
and
i
repeat,
i
think
ludey
is
the
closest
case
of
all,
is
not
the
amount
paid
but
is
the
amount
which
is
properly
deductible
for
the
year.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
you
shortened
the
language
and
perhaps
unduly.
paragraph
2
says,
a
deduction,
nothing
there
had
to
indicate
how
much
the
deduction
is.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
i'm
trying
--
what
i'm
trying
to
suggest
that
a
deduction
is
colorless
as
to
the
amount.
a
deduction,
whatever
that
amount
is,
and
we
contend
that
it's
the
amount
paid
less
27.5%.
a
deduction
is
allowable
for
the
taxable
year
because
it
was
established
after
the
close
of
such
prior
taxable
year
or
years
that
the
taxpayer
did
not
have
an
unrestricted
right
to
such
item.
now
item
is
not
the
same
thing
as
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
$505,000.00.
and
that
is
the
item
but
our
position
is
that
congress
says,
deliberately
used
different
words
and
that
“deduction”
is
a
different
word
than
“item”
and
that
we
still
have
left
to
determine
what
is
the
appropriate
amount
of
the
deduction
and
on
that
i
suggest
that
the
ludey,
ilfeld,
and
arrowsmith
cases
appoint
the
way.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
exactly,
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that's
exactly
the
point
that
i'm
concerned,
that
i
have
not
able
to
make
my
position
thoroughly.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
is
to
define
the
one
of
the
three
conditions
upon
which
section
1341
becomes
operating.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
then
a
deduction.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
right.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
is
exactly
our
position.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
we
deduct
it
from
ordinary
income.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
from
gross
income.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
don't
think
it's
properly
deductible
from
gross
income
from
mining.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
it
would.
but
of
course
it
isn't
really
an
expense
of
the
current
year's
operation
of
that
particular
property.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
not
--
well,
i
guess
the
quick
answer
is
yes.
it
would
reduce
the
current
year's
percentage
depletion
yes
sir
but
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
accounting
wise
it
really
isn't
a
factor
that
goes
to
bringing
gross
income
from
the
property
down
to
taxable
income
from
the
property.
it's
an
expense
of
the
business
generally,
the
settlement
of
a
lawsuit
just
like
compensation
to
central
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that's
true.
that's
right,
yes
sir.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
federal
tax
case
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit.
although
it
is
a
tax
case,
it
is
a
sequel
or
consequence
of
a
decision
rendered
by
this
court
in
1958
in
wisconsin
pipeline
company
against
the
corporation
commission
of
oklahoma
where
this
court
held
that
the
corporation
commission
of
oklahoma
had
no
power
to
fix
minimum
rates
for
the
sale
of
gas.
the
respondent
taxpayer
here
produces
and
sells
natural
gas.
during
the
years
1952
through
1957,
it
charged
its
customers,
those
increased
rates
pursuant
to
the
order
of
the
oklahoma
corporations
commission.
naturally,
the
amounts
which
it
received
were
income
to
it.
they
entered
into
the
computation
of
the
“gross
income
from
the
property”
against
which
it
took
in
each
of
those
years,
1952
to
1957
a
deduction
of
27.5%
as
percentage
depletion
pursuant
to
section
613
of
the
internal
revenue
code.
there's
no
doubt
that
it
was
entitled
to
this
deduction
for
depletion
as
it
clearly
receive
the
gross
income
under
a
claim
of
right
that
the
statute
provided
that
where
income
is
received
from
oil
and
gas,
there
is
a
depletion
deduction.
a
taxpayer
has
his
option
to
take
either
cost
depletion
or
percentage
depletion.
in
this
case,
percentage
depletion
was
advantageous
and
that
was
what
was
taken.
following
this
court's
decision
in
the
pipeline
case,
and
the
respondent
was
sued
by
several
of
its
customers
on
the
ground
that
they
had
been
overcharged.
and
it
promptly
having
no
defense
to
that
case
in
1958,
it
settled
that
controversy
with
two
of
them
and
paid
to
them
an
aggregate
of
$505,536.00
in
1958
and
it
is
the
company's
tax
year
1958
and
only
that
year
which
is
before
the
court.
the
question
is
the
consequence
or
the
way
in
which
it
should
be
treated
of
that
repayment
made
in
1958.
the
taxpayer
deducted
the
repayment
in
full.
we
say
that
the
deduction
allowed
in
1958
should
be
reduced
by
the
amounts
previously
allowed
as
deductions
for
percentage
depletion
in
the
years
1952
through
1957,
that
is
by
27.5%
and
that
is
the
issue
to
which
i
will
return
after
the
recess.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
as
i
was
saying
before
the
recess,
this
case
involves
two
payments
aggregating
$505,000.00
made
by
the
respondent
in
1958
which
represented
repayments
of
excess
charges
for
gas
which
it
had
sold
in
the
years
1952
through
1957
for
which
it
had
received
payment
and
against
which
payments
it
had
deducted
the
statutory
percentage
depletion
in
the
amount
of
27.5%.
taxpayer's
contention
is
that
it
is
entitled
to
deduct
the
entire
amount
of
the
repayments
made
in
1958
despite
the
fact
that
depletion
had
already
been
deducted
with
respect
to
them.
there
is
some
discussion
in
the
briefs
as
to
whether
this
deduction
is
under
the
deduction
for
a
loss
or
the
deduction
for
business
expense
as
suggestion
made
that
the
government
has
changed
its
ground
on
that.
i
do
not
think
that
that
is
the
case.
the
stipulation
in
the
matter
on
page
18,
the
last
line
of
the
page
in
the
appendix
simply
says
that
they
took
a
deduction
but
i
spend
no
time
on
this
because
i
do
not
think
it
is
important
or
of
any
consequence
in
any
event.
the
district
court
agreed
with
the
government's
argument
and
entered
judgment
for
the
government
based
on
the
position
that
the
deduction
for
1958
should
be
reduced
by
the
amount
of
percentage
depletion
which
had
already
been
allowed
as
a
deduction
with
respect
to
the
payments.
on
appeal,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit
reversed.
it
then
granted
the
government's
petition
for
rehearing
but
after
the
rehearing,
the
court
adhered
to
its
earlier
decision
by
a
two-to-one
vote,
judge
hill
writing
an
extensive
dissenting
opinion.
now,
with
respect
to
the
law,
i
think
that
it
can
fairly
be
said
that
what
is
really
involved
here
is
basic
questions
of
proper
tax
accounting
and
it
was
because
of
the
undesirability
of
having
clear
principles
already
established
by
this
court
made
confusing
that
we
felt
that
it
was
important
to
seek
a
review
here.
the
case
also
involves
section
1341
of
the
internal
revenue
code
and
i'll
turn
to
that
in
a
moment.
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
though
that
even
though
section
1341
must
be
considered,
the
proper
conclusion
is
that
on
consideration,
one
could
come
to
the
conclusion
that
section
1341
is
in
fact
bypassed
in
this
case
and
that
the
case
should
be
decided
exactly
as
it
would
be
decided
if
section
1341
had
never
been
enacted.
now,
the
relevant
portion
of
section
1341
is
set
out
on
pages
10
and
11
of
our
brief.
it
is
also
in
the
appendix
to
both
briefs
of
elsewhere
but
looking
at
page
10
of
the
government's
brief,
we
find
that
it
starts
out
with
if
and
then
there
are
five
numbered
paragraphs.
the
first
three
are
conditions
to
the
application
of
the
section
and
i
would
point
out
that
paragraph
1
says,
if
an
item,
and
i
would
call
attention
to
those
words,
“an
item
was
included
in
gross
income
for
a
prior
taxable
year
or
years
because
it
appears
that
a
taxpayer
have
an
unrestrictive
right
to
such
item.”
now
that's
the
payments
which
the
respondent
receives
in
the
year
1952
to
1957.
two,
a
deduction
--
now,
i
call
your
attention
to
the
fact
that
that
is
not
the
same
word.
it
is
a
different
word.
it
does
not
follow
that
the
deduction
is
in
the
same
amount
as
the
item.
the
deduction
is
whatever
is
the
appropriate
amount
of
deduction.
in
the
light
of
the
fact
that
an
item
was
received
“a
deduction
is
allowable
for
the
taxable
year
because
it
was
established
after
the
close
of
such
prior
taxable
year
or
years,
that
the
taxpayer
does
not
have
an
unrestrictive
right
to
such
item
or
to
a
portion
of
such
item”
and
that
condition
is
met
here.
and
three,
“the
amount
of
such
deduction
exceeds
$3000.00.”
that
condition
is
met.
then
the
tax
imposed
by
this
chapter
for
the
taxable
year
shall
be
the
lesser
of
the
following
and
now
there
are
the
two-numbered
paragraphs
4
and
5.
i
think
it's
convenient
to
say
the
taxpayer
has
his
option
of
proceeding
under
one
or
the
other.
actually,
the
statute
says
that
the
tax
shall
be
the
lesser
of
these
two.
four,
the
tax
for
the
taxable
year
computed
with
such
deduction
and
you'll
notice,
the
deduction
goes
back
to
the
item
in
the
word
in
paragraph
2
or
5,
and
5
is
barely
long
but
it
says,
in
substance
that
the
other
matter
which
is
to
be
computed
in
determining
which
is
the
lesser
is
in
effect
to
take
the
amount
out
of
the
prior
taxable
year
reducing
the
taxes
for
this
year
by
the
taxes
which
were
as
it
now
develops
improperly
paid
in
the
earlier
year.
now,
the
fact
is
that
section
1341
(a)
(5),
the
language
on
page
11
of
the
government's
brief
was
not
utilized
by
the
taxpayer
here.
this
case
arises
with
respect
to
section
1341
(a)
(4)
which
provides
the
tax
for
the
taxable
year
computed
with
such
deduction
is
the
amount
which
is
to
be
taken
into
account
and
i
suggest
that
that
leaves
the
situation
exactly
where
it
would
have
been
if
section
1341
had
never
been
enacted
because
the
tax
for
the
taxable
year
would
be
computed
with
such
deduction
prior
to
the
enactment
of
section
1341.
the
taxpayer
here
has
simply
found
it
desirable
not
to
use
the
relief
which
section
1341
provided
through
paragraph
5
because
that
would
have
been
less
advantageous
to
get
at
its
claim
under
paragraph
(a)
(4)
and
interestingly
enough,
this
was
expressly
recognized
by
the
court
below
in
its
first
opinion.
this
is
on
page
42
of
the
appendix
in
judge
seay's
opinion
beginning
the
first
full
paragraph
on
that
page,
“thus,
it
appears
that
congress
by
section
1341
enacted
the
existing
rule
as
to
current
year
deductions
and
added
another
provision.”
but
1341
(a)
(4)
is
simply
the
existing
rule,
the
rule
that
would
have
been
applicable
if
1341
have
never
been
passed
and
then
later
in
the
same
paragraph,
a
little
below
the
middle
of
the
paragraph,
“thus,
it
must
be
concluded
that
congress
sought
to
make
no
change
in
the
current
year
deduction
remedy
but
only
added
the
recomputation
provision.”
and
in
our
view,
the
court
was
thoroughly
sound
in
saying
that
but
simply
did
not
pursue
it
through
to
its
conclusion
because
the
majority
of
the
court
below
reached
its
result
in
effect
by
construing
section
1341
and
saying
that
the
word
deduction
in
those
several
provisions
must
be
read
as
having
the
same
meaning
as
the
word
“item”
in
paragraph
1.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
mr.
justice,
i
think
it
is
clear
and
i
hope
that
it
will
be
after
this
court
has
decided
this
case.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
at
the
present
time,
it
is
somewhat
clouded
by
the
decision
of
the
tenth
circuit
but
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
didn't
choose
paragraph
5
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
which
would
have
meant
throwing
it
back
into
the
earlier
year
and
reducing
the
tax
for
this
year
by
the
amount
of
tax
which
it
paid.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
mr.
justice.
paragraph
5
might
have
been
very
advantageous
to
them
suppose
for
example
they
have
had
a
lost
in
1958
then
they
would
want
to
use
paragraph
5.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
suppose
they
had
had
a
smaller
loss
or
putting
it
another
way,
section
1341
is
very
much
a
consequence
of
this
court's
decision
in
the
arrowsmith
case.
the
arrowsmith
case
involved
a
situation
where
the
taxpayer
received
an
amount
in
liquidation
of
a
corporation
in
one
year
and
returned
that
as
income
as
a
capital
gain.
in
a
later
year,
it
was
required
to
make
a
payment
with
respect
to
that
on
the
ground
that
it
was
a
transferee
from
the
corporation
and
the
corporation
owed
money.
there
was
no
suggestion
that
they
were
not
entitled
to
deduct
the
amount
in
the
later
year.
the
only
question
in
the
arrowsmith
case
was
whether
the
deduction
was
as
a
capital
loss
or
as
an
ordinary
loss
and
this
court
held
that
since
the
repayment
in
the
later
year
arose
out
of
the
capital
transaction.
it
was
to
be
treated
as
a
capital
loss
and
that
is
a
case
which
we
think
supports
our
position
here
but
the
problem
which
it
presented
was
that
capital
losses
are
subject
to
superior
restriction
as
to
their
deductibility
and
they
might
have
included
the
amount
in
the
earlier
year
in
income
be
entitled
to
deduct
it
as
a
capital
loss
in
the
later
year
but
get
very
little
benefit
from
it,
and
it
was
for
that
reason
that
1341
(a)
(5)
was
enacted
to
say
that
if
they
got
little
benefit
from
it
in
the
later
year,
they
could
reduce
their
tax
for
the
later
year
by
the
amount
of
tax
which
they
paid
in
the
earlier
year.
you
also
get
similar
situations
where
there
are
changes
in
the
tax
rates.
in
this
particular
case,
the
tax
rates
were
exactly
the
same
in
each
year.
there
were
no
losses
that
affected
the
situation,
no
carryover,
so
that
the
only
reason
the
taxpayer
wanted
to
use
1341
(a)
(4)
was
because
it
thought
as
the
tenth
circuit
held
that
such
deduction
in
1341
(a)
(4)
meant
the
same
thing
as
the
item
or
an
item
in
1341
(a)
(1)
and
allowed
the
taxpayer
to
deduct
the
entire
amount
of
the
payment
despite
the
fact
that
27.5%
had
already
been
deducted
with
respect
to
the
same
payment.
now,
we
contend
that
that
is
wrong
as
a
matter
of
principle,
that
this
is
in
the
area
of
proper
tax
accounting
long
since
established
by
decisions
of
this
court
that
section
1341
was
wrongly
construed
by
the
court
below
and
that
when
it
is
rightly
construed,
it
leaves
the
well-known
decisions
of
this
court
in
full
operation
which
would
require
the
adjustment
for
which
the
government
contends.
now,
in
some
ways
the
closest
of
these
cases
is
one
that
was
decided
long
ago,
united
states
against
ludey,
decided
in
1927,
opinion
by
mr.
justice
brandeis
who
had
a
very
excellent
grasp
of
the
accounting
background
and
problems
in
this
area.
brief
for
the
united
states
was
written
in
the
time
of
solicitor
general
mitchell
and
i
was
much
interested
in
reading
that
brief
to
find
that
the
argument
which
he
then
made
is
essentially
the
argument
which
we
are
trying
to
present
here
and
it
is
the
argument
which
was
accepted
by
the
court.
the
ludey
case
involves
the
determination
of
the
amount
of
gain
on
the
sale
of
a
mining
property.
it
arose
with
respect
to
the
year
1917
which
was
before
there
was
any
provision
in
the
statute
providing
for
the
adjustment
of
basis
of
property
on
the
sale
of
property.
the
statute
provided
explicitly
that
the
basis
of
property
shall
be
its
cost
or
its
march
1,
1913
value.
in
that
case,
the
taxpayer
had
deducted
the
depreciation
on
its
machinery.
it
had
deducted
depletion
with
respect
to
its
oil
which
had
been
taken
out.
but
when
they
came
to
sell
the
property,
they
computed
their
loss
by
taking
the
full
cost
with
no
adjustment
for
the
depreciation
and
depletion
which
had
been
sustained
and
the
court
of
claims
supported
the
taxpayer
in
that
and
said
that
there
was
no
basis
in
the
statute
for
the
adjustment.
there
was
some
controversy
as
to
amount
of
the
adjustment
if
it
was
to
be
made
namely
whether
it
was
the
amount
which
the
taxpayer
had
actually
deducted
or
depletion
and
depreciation
or
whether
the
adjustment
to
basis
should
be
the
amount
which
they
could
have
deducted
if
they
had
taken
all
that
they
could
and
should
have
taken
and
this
court
in
the
opinion
by
justice
brandeis
and
let
me
emphasize
again
without
any
explicit
statutory
provision,
simply
as
a
matter
of
general
principles
of
tax
accounting,
held
that
in
computing
the
gain
or
loss
on
the
sale,
the
basis
must
be
adjusted
by
the
amount
of
depreciation
and
depletion
sustained
and
remanded
the
case
to
the
court
of
claims
to
determine
that
amount.
now
the
next
case
chronologically
which
provides
a
part
of
this
basis
for
determining
sound
principles
of
tax
accounting
is
charles
ilfeld
company
against
hernandez
in
292
u.s.
now
that
is
a
case
where
a
parent
company
had
some
subsidiaries
and
if
filed
consolidated
returns
with
those
subsidiaries.
the
subsidiaries
had
losses
in
nearly
all
of
the
years
involved
and
the
effect
of
the
consolidated
returns
was
that
the
subsidiary
losses
were
deducted
against
the
parent's
income
which
was
entirely
right
and
appropriate
as
the
function
of
consolidated
return.
but
in
the
year
1927
which
was
involved
in
that
case,
the
parent
liquidated
the
subsidiaries
and
since
the
subsidiaries
had
had
consistent
losses,
the
parent
got
very
little
out
of
the
subsidiaries
when
it
liquidated
them
and
it
sought
to
deduct
on
its
tax
return
the
amount
of
the
loss
which
it
sustained
on
the
liquidation
of
the
subsidiaries.
here
again,
there
was
nothing
in
the
statute
which
dealt
expressly
with
it.
there
was
a
statutory
provision
giving
the
commissioner
broad
power
to
make
regulations
in
this
area.
the
commissioner
had
made
regulations
but
none
of
them
really
quite
fit
this
particular
situation
and
in
the
ilfeld
case,
an
opinion
by
justice
butler,
the
court
held
that
the
loss
could
not
be
taken
because
in
the
court's
language
and
this
is
quoted
on
page
19
of
the
government's
brief.
if
allowed,
this
would
be
the
practical
equivalent
of
double
deduction.
and
that
of
course
is
exactly
the
situation
which
is
involved
here.
if
the
taxpayer
here
is
allowed
to
deduct
the
entire
amount
paid
in
1958,
it
will
with
respect
to
this
transaction
have
deducted
an
aggregate
of
127.5%
of
the
amount
paid
because
it
has
already
deducted
27.5%
as
percentage
depletion.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well
that
--
you
can
say
in
effect
that
they
have
deducted
27.5%
twice
with
respect
to
the
same
mineral.
this
is
a
little
complicated
to
answer
because
we're
dealing
with
percentage
depletion.
it
has
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
the
amount
that
was
lost
where
a
cost
depletion
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
depended
on
what
the
gross
income
for
mining
was
and
we
contend
that
the
505,000
repaid
in
1958
reduced
the
gross
income
from
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
as
it
now
turns
out,
the
depletion
allowance
in
the
prior
return
was
not
justified.
however,
under
decisions
of
this
court
like
arrowsmith,
without
section
1341,
you
don't
go
back
and
correct
the
earlier
year.
you
make
the
proper
correction
in
this
year
and
we
suggest
that
the
proper
adjustment
is
to
allow
the
deduction
the
$505,000.00
paid
less
27.5%
percentage
depletion
which
has
already
been
deducted.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
mr.
justice
that
is
pretty
close
to
the
taxpayer's
contention
in
this
case.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
seems
to
me
that
the
--
it
seems
to
me
to
begging
your
pardon
clearly
wrong.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
let
me
just
take
the
language.
1341
(a)
(4),
the
tax
for
the
taxable
year
computed
with
such
deduction,
that
doesn't
how
much?
it
just
says
“such
deduction.”
that
obviously
refers
back
to
1341
(a)
(2)
as
a
deduction.
now,
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
seems
to
me
that
in
the
statement
which
you
have
made,
you
have
taken
the
next
leap
which
is
to
say
that
a
deduction
means
in
this
case
$505,000.00
and
i
suggest
that
there's
nothing
in
1341
(a)
(2)
which
says
that
the
deduction
to
which
a
deduction
refers
is
$505,000.00.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
clearly,
it
does.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that's
the
amount
of
the
overpayment.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
because
i
think
that
a
deduction
does
not
have
the
same
meaning
as
the
words
“the
amount
repaid.”
it
does
not
have
the
same
meaning
as
the
word
“an
item”
in
paragraph
1.
now,
the
item
was
$505,000.00
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
was
what
was
taken
into
income.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
only
mr.
justice
if
you
take
the
position
which
i
think
is
not
warranted
that
the
deduction
referred
to
in
1341
(a)
(2)
is
the
same
in
amount
as
the
amount
of
the
item
which
was
paid
out
and
what
i
have
been
trying
to
suggest
is
that
the
amount
of
the
deduction
to
which
the
taxpayer
is
entitled,
under
cases
like
ludey
and
i
repeat,
i
think
ludey
is
the
closest
case
of
all,
is
not
the
amount
paid
but
is
the
amount
which
is
properly
deductible
for
the
year.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
you
shortened
the
language
and
perhaps
unduly.
paragraph
2
says,
a
deduction,
nothing
there
had
to
indicate
how
much
the
deduction
is.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
i'm
trying
--
what
i'm
trying
to
suggest
that
a
deduction
is
colorless
as
to
the
amount.
a
deduction,
whatever
that
amount
is,
and
we
contend
that
it's
the
amount
paid
less
27.5%.
a
deduction
is
allowable
for
the
taxable
year
because
it
was
established
after
the
close
of
such
prior
taxable
year
or
years
that
the
taxpayer
did
not
have
an
unrestricted
right
to
such
item.
now
item
is
not
the
same
thing
as
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
$505,000.00.
and
that
is
the
item
but
our
position
is
that
congress
says,
deliberately
used
different
words
and
that
“deduction”
is
a
different
word
than
“item”
and
that
we
still
have
left
to
determine
what
is
the
appropriate
amount
of
the
deduction
and
on
that
i
suggest
that
the
ludey,
ilfeld,
and
arrowsmith
cases
appoint
the
way.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
exactly,
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that's
exactly
the
point
that
i'm
concerned,
that
i
have
not
able
to
make
my
position
thoroughly.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
is
to
define
the
one
of
the
three
conditions
upon
which
section
1341
becomes
operating.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
then
a
deduction.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
right.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
is
exactly
our
position.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
we
deduct
it
from
ordinary
income.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
from
gross
income.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
don't
think
it's
properly
deductible
from
gross
income
from
mining.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
it
would.
but
of
course
it
isn't
really
an
expense
of
the
current
year's
operation
of
that
particular
property.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
not
--
well,
i
guess
the
quick
answer
is
yes.
it
would
reduce
the
current
year's
percentage
depletion
yes
sir
but
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
accounting
wise
it
really
isn't
a
factor
that
goes
to
bringing
gross
income
from
the
property
down
to
taxable
income
from
the
property.
it's
an
expense
of
the
business
generally,
the
settlement
of
a
lawsuit
just
like
compensation
to
central
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that's
true.
that's
right,
yes
sir.
