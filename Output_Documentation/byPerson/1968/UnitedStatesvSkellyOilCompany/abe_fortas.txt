justice
abe
fortas
mr.
solicitor
general,
i
hope
you
won't
mind,
i
really
have
difficulty
in
understanding
why
1341
(a)
(4)
is
not
controlling
here.
it
seems
to
me
that
that
may
to
my
mind
at
the
moment,
that's
the
central
question.
i
have
difficulty
with
your
suggestion
that
the
court
below
construed
the
word
deduction
as
meaning
item
in
paragraph
1
because
it
seems
pretty
clear
that
deduction
refers
to
paragraph
2
and
paragraph
2
defines
deduction
whereas
the
amount
that
was
deducted
for
the
years
1952
for
the
repayment
of
payments
received
in
1952
to
1957
and
if
that
is
so,
1341
(a)
(4)
read
simply
and
literally
seems
to
say
that
for
1958,
the
tax
would
be
computed
with
the
deduction,
namely,
the
deduction
described
in
paragraph
2
which
would
mean
the
amount
that
this
taxpayer
had
to
refund
to
customers.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
tell
me
what's
wrong
mr.
--
i
didn't
follow
you
really.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
know.
i
want
you
to
tell
me
why,
explain.
it
seems
to
me
maybe
that
it
is
--
the
result
is
a
little
startling
to
my
mind
but
i'm
not
sure
how
you
get
around
the
statutory
language.
justice
abe
fortas
and
what
is
the
deduction
under
(a)
(2)?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
of
course,
i
might
think
$505,000.00
when
i'm
suggesting
to
you
that
in
asking
your
help
if
this
is
not
--
if
you
disagree
with
this
as
i
gather
you
do
and
i
don't
understand
why
and
therefore
there's
a
word
such
deduction,
two
words
“such
deduction”,
just
reading
this
and
literally
it
would
seem
to
refer
to
subparagraph
2.
justice
abe
fortas
and
subparagraph
2
would
mean
as
the
amount
$505,000.00
here,
is
that
the
amount
of
the
overpayment?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
it
would
seem
to
refer
to
that
amount
here.
justice
abe
fortas
but
now
tell
me
why
it
doesn't.
justice
abe
fortas
no,
sir
but
--
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
sorry
mr.
solicitor
general
but
paragraph
2
defines
a
deduction
as
being
the
amount,
an
amount
allowable
for
the
taxable
year
because
the
taxpayer
did
not
have
an
unrestricted
right
to
such
item
or
to
a
portion
of
such
item.
now,
that
here
would
be
the
--
as
i
read
it
literally,
regardless
of
whether
the
results
observed
or
not.
as
i
read
it
literally,
that
would
seem
to
refer
to
this
precise
$505,000.00
and
i
still
don't
follow
that.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
but
if
you
will
bear
with
me
a
moment,
you
look
at
(2),
that
defines
for
purposes
of
1341
what
is
meant
by
the
congress
by
the
allowable
deduction
and
it
defines
it
as
i
read
this
as
the
amount
to
which
the
taxpayer
did
not
have
an
unrestricted
right.
justice
abe
fortas
well
go
on
and
you
have
to
read
the
whole
paragraph.
justice
abe
fortas
now,
to
what
did
the
taxpayer
here
not
have
an
unrestricted
right?
to
what
amount?
just
give
it
to
me,
simple.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
what
is
its
function
though?
could
you
help
me
there?
tell
me,
what
is
its
function?
justice
abe
fortas
what
is
the
function
of
the
verbiage
of
subsection
2
if
it
is
not
to
define
the
amount
which
the
taxpayer
may
deduct
in
the
defined
circumstance?
justice
abe
fortas
you
mean
it
defines
the
circumstances
that
is
to
say,
if
you
find
that
the
taxpayer
did
not
have
an
unrestricted
right
to
the
item
that
he
included
in
his
income
in
a
prior
year.
justice
abe
fortas
then
you
go
to
look
--
then
he's
entitled
to
a
deduction?
justice
abe
fortas
and
then
you
find
out
what
the
amount
of
the
deduction
is
not
by
reference
to
the
amount
to
which
he
did
not
have
an
unrestricted
right
but
by
reference
to
the
existing
case
law.
justice
abe
fortas
thank
you.
justice
abe
fortas
well
if
you
had
made
the
refunds
in
the
same
taxable
year,
then
you
would
not
have
gotten
the
benefit
of
the
depletion
allowance
on
those,
isn't
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
and
isn't
it
a
little
bit
difficult
to
think
that
congress
really
intended
to
establish
a
different
rule
just
because
the
refunds
were
made
in
a
subsequent
year?
justice
abe
fortas
but
you
can't?
there
isn't
anything
in
the
legislative
history
that
i've
noticed
in
your
brief.
justice
abe
fortas
and
you
would
not
welcome
that
suggestion?
justice
abe
fortas
is
there
--
may
i
ask
you
mr.
casey,
solicitor
general
has
for
the
moment
in
a
way
clarified
my
view
of
the
meaning
of
subparagraph
2.
now
is
there
anything
that
you
want
to
say
about
that?
in
other
words,
the
solicitor
general
now
has
explained
to
me
that
paragraph
2
states
the
circumstances
in
which
the
deduction
may
be
allowed
but
it
does
not
purport
to
describe
or
define
the
amount
of
the
deduction.
now,
do
you,
i
take
it,
do
you
disagree
with
that?
justice
abe
fortas
and
is
there
any
authority
one
way
or
the
other
or
what
do
you
have
to
say
about
it?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
understand
your
position.
i
haven't
started
with.
what
do
you
do
about
subparagraph
2
specifically?
supposing
that
my
colloquy
with
the
solicitor
general.
