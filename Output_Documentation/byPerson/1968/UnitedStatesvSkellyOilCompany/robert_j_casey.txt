mr.
robert
j.
casey
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
that
this
present
discussion
points
out
exactly
the
problem
between
the
solicitor
general
and
myself.
the
deduction
allowable
under
section
1341
(a)
(4)
is
in
fact
described
in
1341
(a)
(2).
it
is
the
amount
which
was
included
by
the
taxpayer
in
gross
income
in
the
year
of
receipt.
we
agree
with
the
answer
to
mr.
justice
white
that
in
fact
the
taxpayer
had
a
percentage
depletion
allowance
but
with
respect
to
this
$505,000.00
and
therefore
the
$505,000.00
did
not
drop
down
in
tax
into
taxable
income.
that
is
true
but
1341
says
it
is
the
amount
included
in
gross
income
which
prevails.
now,
we
have
heard
arguments
here
looking
to
the
ludey
and
ilfeld
cases
which
further
point
out
the
problem
which
percentage
depletion
introduces
into
this
specific
area.
mr.
justice
white
asked
a
question
which
i
thought
was
going
to
lead
to
a
discussion
of
whether
there
is
any
given
amount
which
will
be
recovered
from
a
mineral
property
and
my
answer
to
that
would
be
if
the
question
were
ask
to
me,
no.
there
is
no
amount
to
be
recovered.
now,
we
were
--
our
attention
was
directed
to
the
ludey
case
where
there
was
in
fact
a
specific
dollar
basis
for
property.
ludey
dealt
with
the
cost
--
mr.
robert
j.
casey
no,
sir,
it
would
not.
mr.
robert
j.
casey
yes,
sir.
that
is
absolutely
true.
mr.
robert
j.
casey
but
the
problem
which
that
question
brings
in
is
in
fact
the
finally
determined
principles
of
tax
accounting
which
this
court
has
laid
down,
that
is
the
annual
accounting
concept.
mr.
robert
j.
casey
i
can't
tell
you
that
congress
was
looking
specifically
to
a
depletable
income
item
but
i
can
tell
you
that
in
their
own
words,
congress
said,
“if
the
item
was
included
in
gross
income.”
mr.
robert
j.
casey
it's
typical
for
me
to
imagine
that
this
would
have
escaped
the
attention
of
the
congress.
now,
when
1341
was
passed
by
the
house,
it
did
not
include
the
exception
that
brings
us
here
under
its
umbrella.
mr.
robert
j.
casey
i
think
that
that
is
the
office
of
percentage
depletion.
the
difficulty
that
we
have
in
applying
ludey
and
ilfeld
to
this
case
is
that
we
in
this
case
talk
about
two
separate
and
distinct
deductions.
the
deduction
with
respect
to
percentage
depletion
which
occurred
in
the
years
1952
to
1957
had
to
do
with
a
recovery
of
the
taxpayers'
interest
in
the
mineral
property.
it
is
admitted
that
the
mineral
was
severed
and
sold
in
those
years
and
that
in
fact
the
property
was
depleted.
now,
congress
has
told
us
how
to
measure
that
year's
depletion
of
the
property
for
purposes
of
section
613
and
they
have
said
it
very
clearly
and
the
distinguished
solicitor
general
has
agreed
that
as
of
the
facts
known
at
the
end
of
each
of
the
years
of
receipt,
the
percentage
depletion
allowance
claimed
and
allowed
to
the
taxpayer
was
proper.
mr.
robert
j.
casey
well,
to
--
mr.
robert
j.
casey
we
would
have
recomputed
the
tax
for
the
prior
year
solely
by
excluding
the
amount
from
gross
income.
mr.
robert
j.
casey
well,
this
case
isn't
before
us
but
in
my
opinion,
no
we
would
not
because
percentage
depletion
is
predicated
upon
gross
income
from
the
property
which
is
an
entirely
different
concept
from
gross
income.
mr.
robert
j.
casey
that
is
exactly
right.
mr.
robert
j.
casey
i
don't
think
so.
this
court
had
--
mr.
robert
j.
casey
well,
we
know
that
congress
enacted
lewis
and
healy,
they
codified
it.
this
is
the
annual
accounting
principle
which
says
that
as
of
the
end
of
any
given
taxable
period,
the
taxes
imposed
regardless
of
advantage
or
disadvantage
of
either
the
government
or
the
taxpayer.
now,
we
also
know
that
there
are
other
areas
where
the
time
sequence
has
to
some
taxpayers
and
sometimes
to
the
government
disastrous
results.
the
gordon
case
which
this
court
decided
in
the
fall
i
believe.
if
the
distributions
involved
in
the
gordon
case
had
taken
place
within
one
calendar
year,
the
distributions
would
have
qualified
for
tax
free
treatment
under
the
code
but
a
time
factor
fell
the
end
of
the
taxable
year.
there
were
distributions
made
in
separate
years
and
the
tax
results
were
disastrously
different
for
the
taxpayer.
this
is
the
problem
which
is
always
in
here
in
the
annual
accounting
method.
it
always
has
been
the
subject
of
conjecture
whether
we
wouldn't
all
be
better
off
using
a
transactional
or
an
open
account
approach
to
tax
computation.
but
this
court
has
decided
in
(inaudible)
that
the
needs
of
the
government
for
annual
income
preclude
that.
now,
it
is
not
unusual.
in
fact,
it
is
rather
usual
and
it
is
what
prompted
the
enactment
of
1341
that
when
a
taxpayer
receives
claim
of
right
income
which
and
is
required
to
restore
it
in
a
context
where
in
fact
he
incurs
a
deductible
expense.
the
deductible
expense
incurred
in
this
case
in
the
year
1958
which
as
the
solicitor
general
said
is
the
only
year
before
the
court,
was
not
percentage
depletion
expense.
it
was
the
payment
of
a
lawsuit
of
the
damages
and
litigation,
the
settlement
of
a
lawsuit.
now,
if
you
look
at
the
settlement
of
a
lawsuit.
mr.
robert
j.
casey
if
it
had
been
--
well,
it's
hard
for
me
to
address
myself
to
that.
mr.
robert
j.
casey
no
sir.
no.
you
shouldn't
compute
it
that
way
because
that
is
not
the
thrust
of
the
percentage
depletion
allowance.
mr.
robert
j.
casey
now,
that
is
not
my
position
and
i
hope
i
have
not
left
you
with
that
impression.
i
am
saying
that
this
taxpayer
incurred
a
business
expense
in
the
years
1952
through
1957,
that
is
the
reduction
of
his
mineral
property
by
reason
of
the
severance
and
sale
of
the
mineral.
that
that
deduction
in
those
years
was
computed
not
on
a
basis
of
the
taxpayer's
cost,
not
on
the
basis
of
a
discovery
value,
but
on
ad
hoc
formula
basis
which
the
congress
has
proposed
and
the
congress
has
said
that
you
take
27.5%
of
your
gross
income
from
the
property
limited
by
50%
of
your
taxable
income
from
the
property.
that
is
a
separate
and
completely
different
business
expense
from
the
settlement
of
the
litigation
which
occurred
in
the
year
before
this
court.
mr.
robert
j.
casey
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
j.
casey
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
j.
casey
well,
i
don't
think
mr.
chief
justice
that
we
can
assume
for
a
minute
that
congress
was
unaware
of
this
possibility.
mr.
robert
j.
casey
well,
yes
i
do.
and
number
one
if
i
could
--
mr.
robert
j.
casey
if
i
could
amend
the
question
to
be
asked
of
the
congress
not
to
say
would
you
allow
a
double
percentage
depletion
allowance
because
they
haven't.
we
have
taken
one
percentage
depletion
allowance
in
each
of
the
years
at
the
receipt
the
money.
now,
that
percentage
depletion
allowance
came
to
us
not
because
of
a
successful
lawsuit,
not
because
of
any
other
business
operation
except
the
severance
and
sale
of
our
mineral.
now,
clearly,
congress
had
before
it
the
right
to
do
what
the
government
would
propose
in
this
case
and
that
is,
equalize
the
tax.
if
all
it
wanted
to
do
was
to
make
the
parties
whole,
it
had
in
fact
before
it
a
court
of
claims
decision
which
have
been
decided
in
1953
in
the
perry
case
in
which
the
court
said
the
only
fair
way
to
handle
manners
of
this
kind
is
to
go
back
to
the
year
of
receipt
and
recompute
the
tax
and
that's
the
measure
of
the
deduction
in
the
current
year.
it
had
before
it
the
possibility
of
not
allowing
the
government
or
the
taxpayer
to
take
potluck
to
go
with
the
healy
and
lewis
rules
which
said
no
matter
what
happened
in
the
year
of
receipt,
no
matter
what
tax
benefit
you
had,
we
are
going
to
strike
the
balance
in
the
year
of
restoration
and
if
it's
a
disadvantaged
to
either
side,
that's
the
way
it's
going
to
be
but
they
didn't
do
that.
they
said
--
mr.
robert
j.
casey
yes
indeed,
it
does
sir.
yes,
it
does
because
what
the
government
would
propose
to
do
here
is
take
dollars
which
this
taxpayer
garnered
in
the
ordinary
course
of
its
business
and
traced
those
dollars
to
the
settlement
of
a
lawsuit
which
took
place
in
some
instances
six
years
later.
mr.
robert
j.
casey
well,
i
would
resist
it
if
i
could
but
i
don't
think
that
it
is
really
a
proper
charge
against
that
--
the
operation
of
that
property.
i
also
would
suggest
that
if
congress
wanted
to
put
the
parties
back
where
they
were
without
the
receipt
and
restoration
that
it
could
easily
have
done
so.
it's
very
difficult
for
me
to
see
how
an
argument
can
be
made
as
the
district
court
found
in
this
case
that
all
congress
wanted
to
do
was
equalize
the
tax
burden
because
it
specifically
requires
that
the
current
year's
deduction
as
in
lewis
and
healy
or
the
recomputation
of
the
prior
year's
tax
occasion
solely
by
excluding
the
amount
from
gross
income.
it
gives
the
taxpayer
the
better
of
those
two
worlds.
mr.
robert
j.
casey
yes,
i
do.
mr.
robert
j.
casey
well,
when
you
look
to
deductions
as
the
government's
brief
in
this
case,
no.
you
can't
take
a
deduction
for
an
item
unless
you
have
included
it
in
gross
income.
the
three
1341
case
law
was
clear
on
that.
there
was
a
suggestion
in
a
tax
court
case
that
perhaps
taxable
income
might
be
the
criteria.
in
other
words,
a
tax
benefit
rule
with
a
benefit
running
to
the
government
and
it
is
our
position
that
1341
makes
it
perfectly
plain
that
the
basis
for
the
deduction
here
is
only
inclusion
of
the
item
in
gross
income
the
fact
that
that
inclusion
gave
rise
to
a
tax
is
immaterial.
the
fact
that
the
inclusion
and
gross
income
was
the
government's
reward
from
that
inclusion
was
derogated
from
because
of
deductible
expenses
is
immaterial.
we
feel
that
1341
tells
this
specifically.
if
an
item
is
included
in
gross
income,
if
the
repayments
of
that
item
in
the
subsequent
year
is
a
deductible
event
as
opposed
to
a
non-deductible
event,
a
personal
item
for
example,
if
it's
deductible
then
the
measure
of
the
deduction
is
the
amount
included
in
gross
income
and
if
there
was
any
question
in
case
law
prior
to
the
enactment
of
1341,
that
question
now
must
be
taken
to
the
--
mr.
robert
j.
casey
yes,
subparagraph
2
to
us
makes
it
plain
that
if
the
--
if
there
is
an
allowable
deduction,
i
don't
care
as
the
solicitor
general
said,
we've
had
some
exchanges
as
to
whether
the
deduction
in
the
current
year
is
ordinary
and
necessary
business
expense
under
162
or
a
loss
under
165,
we
don't
care.
if
it's
deductible
because
it
is
determined
that
part
of
that
amount
included
in
gross
income
must
be
restored
because
it
turned
out
that
the
taxpayer
did
not
have
the
unrestricted
right
thereto,
that
the
measure
of
the
deduction
is
in
1341
(a)
(1)
and
(a)
(2)
taken
together,
that
there's
no
room
for
argument
anymore
that
the
inclusion
in
gross
income
must
have
been
of
some
revenue-producing
benefit
to
the
government.
now,
the
difficulty
inherent
in
this
case
is
the
confusion
of
the
percentage
depletion
deduction
in
the
prior
year
with
the
ordinary
and
necessary
business
expense
for
loss
whichever
in
the
year
1958
which
is
before
this
court.
if
you
follow
the
government's
reasoning,
you
would
--
you
are
led
to
the
conclusion
that
when
you
have
--
when
the
taxpayer
in
the
years
of
the
receipt
of
the
income,
severed
and
sold
$505,000.00
worth
of
gas
that
it
suffered
two
depletions.
one,
the
depletion
of
a
property.
but
then
also
some
other
depletion
amount
which
are
taxed
to
$505,000.00
and
serve
to
reduce
the
tax
impact
of
those
dollars
when
paid
out
in
the
subsequent
year
in
a
deductible
amount.
there's
no
authority
for
that.
there's
no
way
it
seems
to
us
that
its
results
can
be
accommodated.
mr.
robert
j.
casey
yes
sir,
you
take
a
cost
depletion
or
percentage
depletion.
mr.
robert
j.
casey
yes
sir.
and
i
must
say
that
the
election
of
the
percentage
depletion
of
course
results
in
the
tax
benefits
of
the
taxpayer.
but
there's
no
way
it
seems
to
us
that
the
payment
of
money
which
is
what
happened
to
the
taxpayer
here
can
give
rise
to
a
reduction
in
any
basis.
there's
no
way
we
can
add
to
the
basis
of
our
properties
because
we
didn't
acquire
them.
we
never
got
the
mineral
back.
we're
not
talking
about
the
double
deduction
of
the
ludey
or
ilfeld
cases
here.
they're
separate
complete
unrelated
deductions.
settlement
of
a
lawsuit
and
the
payment
of
the
dollars
involved
in
that
had
no
more
to
do
with
the
prior
year's
production
except
as
the
basis
of
the
claim
against
this
than
the
payment
of
compensation
or
interest
in
the
later
year.
we
also
find
it
difficult
to
accommodate
the
line
of
cases
which
the
government
decided
in
which
the
thrust
is
that
previously
deducted
items
become
income
in
the
year
of
recapture
or
restoration.
we
would
point
out
to
you
that
in
the
year
1958,
the
taxpayer
never
recovered
anything.
the
mineral
which
it
produced
was
long
gone.
it's
the
impact
of
the
settlement
of
a
lawsuit
on
its
operations
for
that
year
was
entirely
disadvantageous.
there
was
no
recovery,
there
was
no
restoration
and
those
cases
are
therefore
we
submit
inapplicable
here.
it
seems
to
us
that
the
percentage
depletion
allowance,
because
of
its
peculiar
impact
on
the
taxpayer,
because
it
doesn't
relate
to
cost
or
discovery
value
or
any
other
stated
amount
gives
rise
to
conditions
which
are
probably
not
reconcilable
with
established
doctrine
in
other
areas
with
ludey.
it
had
a
cost
basis
for
this
property
and
will
recover
that
cost
through
cost
depletion
and
depreciation
or
with
ilfeld
who
had
a
cost
basis
in
the
stock
for
its
subsidiary
companies
and
effectively
recovered
that
basis
through
the
absorption
of
the
subsidiaries'
losses
against
its
income.
that
is
the
thrust
of
our
argument.
if
congress
had
intended
the
result
contended
for
by
the
taxpayer
--
by
the
government
here,
it
would
have
been
simply
done.
i
referred
earlier
to
the
court
of
claims
case
decided
in
1953
which
showed
how
simply
it
could
be
done,
united
states
against
perry.
in
that
case,
the
taxpayer
donated
property
to
a
charity,
deducted
the
amount
on
its
return
in
the
year
of
the
donation
and
recovered
the
property
in
a
later
year
to
a
tax
detriment.
the
court
of
claims
sought
the
fair
way
to
do
it
would
be
to
look
back
and
see
what
tax
advantage
did
he
get
from
the
donation
in
the
year
he
made
the
donation
and
said
that
that
should
be
the
measure
of
his
tax
detriment
in
the
year
of
recovery
but
the
very
government
that
is
here
urging
that
approach
to
the
skelly
case
prevailed
upon
the
court
of
claims
to
overrule
the
perry
decision.
pointing
out
that
the
annual
accounting
concept
so
ingrained
in
the
tax
law
by
the
decisions
of
this
court
made
that
result
impossible
under
the
law
and
on
the
urging
of
the
government,
the
court
of
claims
recognized
this
error,
went
to
the
annual
accounting
concept
even
though
the
taxpayer
in
the
alice
phelan
sullivan
case
suffered
tax-wise
drastically.
it's
a
two-way
street.
there's
going
to
be
tax
equalization,
it's
got
to
be
equalization
for
the
government
and
for
the
taxpayer.
under
the
law
as
enacted
by
congress,
there
cannot
be
tax
equalization.
the
arguments
advanced
to
this
court
to
overrule
the
decision
below
are
more
properly
advanced
we
submit
to
the
congress.
thank
you.
mr.
robert
j.
casey
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
that
this
present
discussion
points
out
exactly
the
problem
between
the
solicitor
general
and
myself.
the
deduction
allowable
under
section
1341
(a)
(4)
is
in
fact
described
in
1341
(a)
(2).
it
is
the
amount
which
was
included
by
the
taxpayer
in
gross
income
in
the
year
of
receipt.
we
agree
with
the
answer
to
mr.
justice
white
that
in
fact
the
taxpayer
had
a
percentage
depletion
allowance
but
with
respect
to
this
$505,000.00
and
therefore
the
$505,000.00
did
not
drop
down
in
tax
into
taxable
income.
that
is
true
but
1341
says
it
is
the
amount
included
in
gross
income
which
prevails.
now,
we
have
heard
arguments
here
looking
to
the
ludey
and
ilfeld
cases
which
further
point
out
the
problem
which
percentage
depletion
introduces
into
this
specific
area.
mr.
justice
white
asked
a
question
which
i
thought
was
going
to
lead
to
a
discussion
of
whether
there
is
any
given
amount
which
will
be
recovered
from
a
mineral
property
and
my
answer
to
that
would
be
if
the
question
were
ask
to
me,
no.
there
is
no
amount
to
be
recovered.
now,
we
were
--
our
attention
was
directed
to
the
ludey
case
where
there
was
in
fact
a
specific
dollar
basis
for
property.
ludey
dealt
with
the
cost
--
mr.
robert
j.
casey
no,
sir,
it
would
not.
mr.
robert
j.
casey
yes,
sir.
that
is
absolutely
true.
mr.
robert
j.
casey
but
the
problem
which
that
question
brings
in
is
in
fact
the
finally
determined
principles
of
tax
accounting
which
this
court
has
laid
down,
that
is
the
annual
accounting
concept.
mr.
robert
j.
casey
i
can't
tell
you
that
congress
was
looking
specifically
to
a
depletable
income
item
but
i
can
tell
you
that
in
their
own
words,
congress
said,
“if
the
item
was
included
in
gross
income.”
mr.
robert
j.
casey
it's
typical
for
me
to
imagine
that
this
would
have
escaped
the
attention
of
the
congress.
now,
when
1341
was
passed
by
the
house,
it
did
not
include
the
exception
that
brings
us
here
under
its
umbrella.
mr.
robert
j.
casey
i
think
that
that
is
the
office
of
percentage
depletion.
the
difficulty
that
we
have
in
applying
ludey
and
ilfeld
to
this
case
is
that
we
in
this
case
talk
about
two
separate
and
distinct
deductions.
the
deduction
with
respect
to
percentage
depletion
which
occurred
in
the
years
1952
to
1957
had
to
do
with
a
recovery
of
the
taxpayers'
interest
in
the
mineral
property.
it
is
admitted
that
the
mineral
was
severed
and
sold
in
those
years
and
that
in
fact
the
property
was
depleted.
now,
congress
has
told
us
how
to
measure
that
year's
depletion
of
the
property
for
purposes
of
section
613
and
they
have
said
it
very
clearly
and
the
distinguished
solicitor
general
has
agreed
that
as
of
the
facts
known
at
the
end
of
each
of
the
years
of
receipt,
the
percentage
depletion
allowance
claimed
and
allowed
to
the
taxpayer
was
proper.
mr.
robert
j.
casey
well,
to
--
mr.
robert
j.
casey
we
would
have
recomputed
the
tax
for
the
prior
year
solely
by
excluding
the
amount
from
gross
income.
mr.
robert
j.
casey
well,
this
case
isn't
before
us
but
in
my
opinion,
no
we
would
not
because
percentage
depletion
is
predicated
upon
gross
income
from
the
property
which
is
an
entirely
different
concept
from
gross
income.
mr.
robert
j.
casey
that
is
exactly
right.
mr.
robert
j.
casey
i
don't
think
so.
this
court
had
--
mr.
robert
j.
casey
well,
we
know
that
congress
enacted
lewis
and
healy,
they
codified
it.
this
is
the
annual
accounting
principle
which
says
that
as
of
the
end
of
any
given
taxable
period,
the
taxes
imposed
regardless
of
advantage
or
disadvantage
of
either
the
government
or
the
taxpayer.
now,
we
also
know
that
there
are
other
areas
where
the
time
sequence
has
to
some
taxpayers
and
sometimes
to
the
government
disastrous
results.
the
gordon
case
which
this
court
decided
in
the
fall
i
believe.
if
the
distributions
involved
in
the
gordon
case
had
taken
place
within
one
calendar
year,
the
distributions
would
have
qualified
for
tax
free
treatment
under
the
code
but
a
time
factor
fell
the
end
of
the
taxable
year.
there
were
distributions
made
in
separate
years
and
the
tax
results
were
disastrously
different
for
the
taxpayer.
this
is
the
problem
which
is
always
in
here
in
the
annual
accounting
method.
it
always
has
been
the
subject
of
conjecture
whether
we
wouldn't
all
be
better
off
using
a
transactional
or
an
open
account
approach
to
tax
computation.
but
this
court
has
decided
in
(inaudible)
that
the
needs
of
the
government
for
annual
income
preclude
that.
now,
it
is
not
unusual.
in
fact,
it
is
rather
usual
and
it
is
what
prompted
the
enactment
of
1341
that
when
a
taxpayer
receives
claim
of
right
income
which
and
is
required
to
restore
it
in
a
context
where
in
fact
he
incurs
a
deductible
expense.
the
deductible
expense
incurred
in
this
case
in
the
year
1958
which
as
the
solicitor
general
said
is
the
only
year
before
the
court,
was
not
percentage
depletion
expense.
it
was
the
payment
of
a
lawsuit
of
the
damages
and
litigation,
the
settlement
of
a
lawsuit.
now,
if
you
look
at
the
settlement
of
a
lawsuit.
mr.
robert
j.
casey
if
it
had
been
--
well,
it's
hard
for
me
to
address
myself
to
that.
mr.
robert
j.
casey
no
sir.
no.
you
shouldn't
compute
it
that
way
because
that
is
not
the
thrust
of
the
percentage
depletion
allowance.
mr.
robert
j.
casey
now,
that
is
not
my
position
and
i
hope
i
have
not
left
you
with
that
impression.
i
am
saying
that
this
taxpayer
incurred
a
business
expense
in
the
years
1952
through
1957,
that
is
the
reduction
of
his
mineral
property
by
reason
of
the
severance
and
sale
of
the
mineral.
that
that
deduction
in
those
years
was
computed
not
on
a
basis
of
the
taxpayer's
cost,
not
on
the
basis
of
a
discovery
value,
but
on
ad
hoc
formula
basis
which
the
congress
has
proposed
and
the
congress
has
said
that
you
take
27.5%
of
your
gross
income
from
the
property
limited
by
50%
of
your
taxable
income
from
the
property.
that
is
a
separate
and
completely
different
business
expense
from
the
settlement
of
the
litigation
which
occurred
in
the
year
before
this
court.
mr.
robert
j.
casey
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
j.
casey
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
j.
casey
well,
i
don't
think
mr.
chief
justice
that
we
can
assume
for
a
minute
that
congress
was
unaware
of
this
possibility.
mr.
robert
j.
casey
well,
yes
i
do.
and
number
one
if
i
could
--
mr.
robert
j.
casey
if
i
could
amend
the
question
to
be
asked
of
the
congress
not
to
say
would
you
allow
a
double
percentage
depletion
allowance
because
they
haven't.
we
have
taken
one
percentage
depletion
allowance
in
each
of
the
years
at
the
receipt
the
money.
now,
that
percentage
depletion
allowance
came
to
us
not
because
of
a
successful
lawsuit,
not
because
of
any
other
business
operation
except
the
severance
and
sale
of
our
mineral.
now,
clearly,
congress
had
before
it
the
right
to
do
what
the
government
would
propose
in
this
case
and
that
is,
equalize
the
tax.
if
all
it
wanted
to
do
was
to
make
the
parties
whole,
it
had
in
fact
before
it
a
court
of
claims
decision
which
have
been
decided
in
1953
in
the
perry
case
in
which
the
court
said
the
only
fair
way
to
handle
manners
of
this
kind
is
to
go
back
to
the
year
of
receipt
and
recompute
the
tax
and
that's
the
measure
of
the
deduction
in
the
current
year.
it
had
before
it
the
possibility
of
not
allowing
the
government
or
the
taxpayer
to
take
potluck
to
go
with
the
healy
and
lewis
rules
which
said
no
matter
what
happened
in
the
year
of
receipt,
no
matter
what
tax
benefit
you
had,
we
are
going
to
strike
the
balance
in
the
year
of
restoration
and
if
it's
a
disadvantaged
to
either
side,
that's
the
way
it's
going
to
be
but
they
didn't
do
that.
they
said
--
mr.
robert
j.
casey
yes
indeed,
it
does
sir.
yes,
it
does
because
what
the
government
would
propose
to
do
here
is
take
dollars
which
this
taxpayer
garnered
in
the
ordinary
course
of
its
business
and
traced
those
dollars
to
the
settlement
of
a
lawsuit
which
took
place
in
some
instances
six
years
later.
mr.
robert
j.
casey
well,
i
would
resist
it
if
i
could
but
i
don't
think
that
it
is
really
a
proper
charge
against
that
--
the
operation
of
that
property.
i
also
would
suggest
that
if
congress
wanted
to
put
the
parties
back
where
they
were
without
the
receipt
and
restoration
that
it
could
easily
have
done
so.
it's
very
difficult
for
me
to
see
how
an
argument
can
be
made
as
the
district
court
found
in
this
case
that
all
congress
wanted
to
do
was
equalize
the
tax
burden
because
it
specifically
requires
that
the
current
year's
deduction
as
in
lewis
and
healy
or
the
recomputation
of
the
prior
year's
tax
occasion
solely
by
excluding
the
amount
from
gross
income.
it
gives
the
taxpayer
the
better
of
those
two
worlds.
mr.
robert
j.
casey
yes,
i
do.
mr.
robert
j.
casey
well,
when
you
look
to
deductions
as
the
government's
brief
in
this
case,
no.
you
can't
take
a
deduction
for
an
item
unless
you
have
included
it
in
gross
income.
the
three
1341
case
law
was
clear
on
that.
there
was
a
suggestion
in
a
tax
court
case
that
perhaps
taxable
income
might
be
the
criteria.
in
other
words,
a
tax
benefit
rule
with
a
benefit
running
to
the
government
and
it
is
our
position
that
1341
makes
it
perfectly
plain
that
the
basis
for
the
deduction
here
is
only
inclusion
of
the
item
in
gross
income
the
fact
that
that
inclusion
gave
rise
to
a
tax
is
immaterial.
the
fact
that
the
inclusion
and
gross
income
was
the
government's
reward
from
that
inclusion
was
derogated
from
because
of
deductible
expenses
is
immaterial.
we
feel
that
1341
tells
this
specifically.
if
an
item
is
included
in
gross
income,
if
the
repayments
of
that
item
in
the
subsequent
year
is
a
deductible
event
as
opposed
to
a
non-deductible
event,
a
personal
item
for
example,
if
it's
deductible
then
the
measure
of
the
deduction
is
the
amount
included
in
gross
income
and
if
there
was
any
question
in
case
law
prior
to
the
enactment
of
1341,
that
question
now
must
be
taken
to
the
--
mr.
robert
j.
casey
yes,
subparagraph
2
to
us
makes
it
plain
that
if
the
--
if
there
is
an
allowable
deduction,
i
don't
care
as
the
solicitor
general
said,
we've
had
some
exchanges
as
to
whether
the
deduction
in
the
current
year
is
ordinary
and
necessary
business
expense
under
162
or
a
loss
under
165,
we
don't
care.
if
it's
deductible
because
it
is
determined
that
part
of
that
amount
included
in
gross
income
must
be
restored
because
it
turned
out
that
the
taxpayer
did
not
have
the
unrestricted
right
thereto,
that
the
measure
of
the
deduction
is
in
1341
(a)
(1)
and
(a)
(2)
taken
together,
that
there's
no
room
for
argument
anymore
that
the
inclusion
in
gross
income
must
have
been
of
some
revenue-producing
benefit
to
the
government.
now,
the
difficulty
inherent
in
this
case
is
the
confusion
of
the
percentage
depletion
deduction
in
the
prior
year
with
the
ordinary
and
necessary
business
expense
for
loss
whichever
in
the
year
1958
which
is
before
this
court.
if
you
follow
the
government's
reasoning,
you
would
--
you
are
led
to
the
conclusion
that
when
you
have
--
when
the
taxpayer
in
the
years
of
the
receipt
of
the
income,
severed
and
sold
$505,000.00
worth
of
gas
that
it
suffered
two
depletions.
one,
the
depletion
of
a
property.
but
then
also
some
other
depletion
amount
which
are
taxed
to
$505,000.00
and
serve
to
reduce
the
tax
impact
of
those
dollars
when
paid
out
in
the
subsequent
year
in
a
deductible
amount.
there's
no
authority
for
that.
there's
no
way
it
seems
to
us
that
its
results
can
be
accommodated.
mr.
robert
j.
casey
yes
sir,
you
take
a
cost
depletion
or
percentage
depletion.
mr.
robert
j.
casey
yes
sir.
and
i
must
say
that
the
election
of
the
percentage
depletion
of
course
results
in
the
tax
benefits
of
the
taxpayer.
but
there's
no
way
it
seems
to
us
that
the
payment
of
money
which
is
what
happened
to
the
taxpayer
here
can
give
rise
to
a
reduction
in
any
basis.
there's
no
way
we
can
add
to
the
basis
of
our
properties
because
we
didn't
acquire
them.
we
never
got
the
mineral
back.
we're
not
talking
about
the
double
deduction
of
the
ludey
or
ilfeld
cases
here.
they're
separate
complete
unrelated
deductions.
settlement
of
a
lawsuit
and
the
payment
of
the
dollars
involved
in
that
had
no
more
to
do
with
the
prior
year's
production
except
as
the
basis
of
the
claim
against
this
than
the
payment
of
compensation
or
interest
in
the
later
year.
we
also
find
it
difficult
to
accommodate
the
line
of
cases
which
the
government
decided
in
which
the
thrust
is
that
previously
deducted
items
become
income
in
the
year
of
recapture
or
restoration.
we
would
point
out
to
you
that
in
the
year
1958,
the
taxpayer
never
recovered
anything.
the
mineral
which
it
produced
was
long
gone.
it's
the
impact
of
the
settlement
of
a
lawsuit
on
its
operations
for
that
year
was
entirely
disadvantageous.
there
was
no
recovery,
there
was
no
restoration
and
those
cases
are
therefore
we
submit
inapplicable
here.
it
seems
to
us
that
the
percentage
depletion
allowance,
because
of
its
peculiar
impact
on
the
taxpayer,
because
it
doesn't
relate
to
cost
or
discovery
value
or
any
other
stated
amount
gives
rise
to
conditions
which
are
probably
not
reconcilable
with
established
doctrine
in
other
areas
with
ludey.
it
had
a
cost
basis
for
this
property
and
will
recover
that
cost
through
cost
depletion
and
depreciation
or
with
ilfeld
who
had
a
cost
basis
in
the
stock
for
its
subsidiary
companies
and
effectively
recovered
that
basis
through
the
absorption
of
the
subsidiaries'
losses
against
its
income.
that
is
the
thrust
of
our
argument.
if
congress
had
intended
the
result
contended
for
by
the
taxpayer
--
by
the
government
here,
it
would
have
been
simply
done.
i
referred
earlier
to
the
court
of
claims
case
decided
in
1953
which
showed
how
simply
it
could
be
done,
united
states
against
perry.
in
that
case,
the
taxpayer
donated
property
to
a
charity,
deducted
the
amount
on
its
return
in
the
year
of
the
donation
and
recovered
the
property
in
a
later
year
to
a
tax
detriment.
the
court
of
claims
sought
the
fair
way
to
do
it
would
be
to
look
back
and
see
what
tax
advantage
did
he
get
from
the
donation
in
the
year
he
made
the
donation
and
said
that
that
should
be
the
measure
of
his
tax
detriment
in
the
year
of
recovery
but
the
very
government
that
is
here
urging
that
approach
to
the
skelly
case
prevailed
upon
the
court
of
claims
to
overrule
the
perry
decision.
pointing
out
that
the
annual
accounting
concept
so
ingrained
in
the
tax
law
by
the
decisions
of
this
court
made
that
result
impossible
under
the
law
and
on
the
urging
of
the
government,
the
court
of
claims
recognized
this
error,
went
to
the
annual
accounting
concept
even
though
the
taxpayer
in
the
alice
phelan
sullivan
case
suffered
tax-wise
drastically.
it's
a
two-way
street.
there's
going
to
be
tax
equalization,
it's
got
to
be
equalization
for
the
government
and
for
the
taxpayer.
under
the
law
as
enacted
by
congress,
there
cannot
be
tax
equalization.
the
arguments
advanced
to
this
court
to
overrule
the
decision
below
are
more
properly
advanced
we
submit
to
the
congress.
thank
you.
