justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
solicitor
general,
is
the
law
clear
that
if
the
other
alternative
had
been
used
namely
recomputing
the
prior
years
tax
that
in
computing
that
tax,
you
would
have
just
excluded
the
item
of
income
but
still
retain
the
depletion
and
deduction?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
mean,
it
isn't
clear
under
that
other
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that
is
under
a
different
way
of
approaching,
is
it?
i
mean,
let's
say,
at
least
it
--
you
say,
there
are
two
ways
of
approaching
it.
the
taxpayer
had
no
alternative
and
it
didn't
choose
the
recomputation
route
--
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
what
i
mean.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
it
had
done
that
though,
would
you
say
the
law
is
unclear
that
in
so
doing,
all
it
would
have
done
was
to
exclude
the
item
of
income
to
the
prior
year?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
well,
they
wouldn't
have
paid
any
tax
at
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
it
also
accurate
to
say
that
in
effect
the
depletion
which
was
actually
taken
in
the
prior
year
with
respect
to
a
certain
amount
of
income
from
mining,
if
you
then
deduct
some
of
the
income
in
the
later
year
and
leave
that
depletion
taken
on
the
prior
year,
you
will
take
any
much
higher
percentage
of
depletion
as
against
the
remaining
income?
is
that
the
same
idea
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
amount
--
the
amount
of
percentage
depletion
depended
on
what
the
gross
income
for
mining
was
included
in
that
return.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
therefore,
the
depletion
allowance,
the
prior
return
was
unjustified.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
fact,
the
taxpayer
never
did
pay
taxes
for
the
previous
year
on
entire
amount
of
the
item.
justice
byron
r.
white
could
i
ask
you
that
if
this
so-called
item
had
not
been
included
in
the
previous
year's
income,
would
your
percentage
of
depletion
taken
in
that
year
have
been
the
same?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
would
have
been
27.5%
of
the
item
left?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
think
congress
actually
thought
in
these
terms
and
decided
to
leave,
to
give
a
full
deduction
for
the
item
and
leave
the
depletion
in
the
previous
year
intact?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
see
--
but
you
think
in
fact
that
they
used
these
words
construed
as
you
say
they
should
be
construed
as
you
say
they
should
be
construed
that
it
actually
have
in
mind
the
situation
before
the
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
don't
think
it's
surprising
that
congress
would
say
you
may
reduce
your
income
in
effect
the
previous
year
without
reducing
your
depletion.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
would
happen
if
you
had
elected
to
use
(a)
(5)?
justice
byron
r.
white
then
you
would
have
recomputed
your
tax
to
the
prior
year,
wouldn't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
don't
think
you
would
have
any
change
your
depletion
deduction?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
it
really
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
as
always
then,
would
you
think
for
an
allowance
is
based
on
the
amount
by
which,
physically
a
(inaudible).
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
you
are
asking
me
to
compute
as
though
the
percentage
of
the
depletion
allowance
was
a
fixed
amount
based
upon
say
the
tonnage
or
the
gallons?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
again,
mr.
justice
fortas
suggested
that
this
settlement
been
paid
at
the
year
your
income
defining
what
it
had
produced?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
your
depletion?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
what
does
your
--
what
was
this
deduction
amount
to
the
current
year,
$505,000.00
for
your
--
justice
byron
r.
white
gross
income?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
then
should
deduct
it
from
gross
income
from
mining
for
the
current
year?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
it
were,
why
you
would
have
to
make
your
percentage
depletion
as
we
have
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
i
suppose
if
you
were
permitted
or
required
deducted
income
for
mining
this
year,
you
would
have
the
same
effect
roughly
that
the
government's
interest.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
accounting
wise
you
may
not
do
that
in
this
year
or
you
don't
want
to
do
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
this
particular
case,
the
year,
the
way
you
deducted
it
in
1950
taxes
did
not
really
reduce
incoem
from
mining,
income
from
the
property
at
first
(inaudible)
depletion
in
1958.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
have
an
election
in
the
oil
business
as
to
how
to
take
the
depletion?
