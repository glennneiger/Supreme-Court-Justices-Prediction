justice
abe
fortas
but
mr.
moss,
i
wonder
if
they
aren't
some
further
complications
here.
for
example,
here's
a
man
who's
in
the
--
under
federal
sentence
and
is
serving
time
in
the
federal
penitentiary.
he
is
also
under
state
indictment.
he
says
as
i
recall
that
because
of
the
pending
state
indictment,
my
treatment,
what
happens
to
me
in
the
federal
penitentiary
is
affected.
he
also
says
that
my
possibilities
of
getting
out
on
probation
are
affected.
and
i
wonder
if
this
may
affect
of
course
ewell,
but
i
wonder
if
there
isn't
something
to
the
point
that
as
use
indicator
when
they
started
off
that
state
court
indictment
hanging
around
for
seven
years
does
raise
a
substantial
question
which
can't
quietly
dispose
off
by
saying
that
just
let
the
man
wait
until
it
gets
out
of
the
federal
penitentiary
and
then
is
brought
to
trial
in
the
state.
justice
abe
fortas
i
beg
your
pardon?
justice
abe
fortas
what
about
mr.
moss'
point
professor
wright
that
there
ought
to
be
a
trial
here
to
ascertain
whether
there
has
been
a
waiver?
i
suppose
that
could
be
a
waiver
of
the
right
to
speedy
trial.
justice
abe
fortas
and
as
i
understood,
mr.
moss,
he
was
suggesting
that
trial
is
necessary
here
to
or
hearing
is
necessary
in
the
record
that
at
which
a
record
can
be
made
to
test
out
whether
there
has
in
fact
been
a
waiver.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
wright,
i
wonder
if
you
might
care
to
say
something
about
mr.
moss'
argument
that
we
should
wait
and
tell
after
the
prisoner
has
been
tried,
has
been
brought
to
trial
in
texas
because
the
texas
court
itself
might
at
that
time
dismiss
in
response
to
motion
based
on
the
absence
of
the
speedy
trial,
or
something
else
might
happen
that
would
dispose
of
the
case.
in
other
words,
the
question
is
whether
this
in
effect
is
not
premature.
