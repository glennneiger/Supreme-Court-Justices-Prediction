mr.
joe
s.
moss
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
there
is
absolutely
no
issue
here
about
the
right
of
this
petitioner
to
a
speedy
trial.
i,
as
a
representative
of
the
prosecution
in
the
concerned
jurisdiction,
harris
county
of
the
state
of
texas,
have
long
thought
that
it's
absolutely
outrageous
to
keep
things
like
this
hanging
over
the
heads
of
prisoners
who
are
incarcerated
under
the
jurisdiction
of
other
sovereigns
whether
it
be
a
state
or
other
federal
government.
likewise,
i
fully
realize
as
your
honors
have
noticed
in
some
of
your
recent
opinions
that
it
is
a
matter
of
common
knowledge
that
people
charge
with
crime
rarely
want
a
trial
at
all
and
if
they
must
have
one
they
hardly
ever
want
it
to
be
speedy.
delay
as
it
operates
to
the
disadvantage
of
the
prosecution
and
to
the
advantage
of
the
defendant
petitioner
here
because
the
memories
of
witnesses
dimmed
and
that
necessarily
affects
the
burden
that
the
prosecution
must
bear
in
establishing
the
guilt.
bearing
that
in
mind,
we
are
here
today
concerned
with
a
remedy.
we
are
going
to
try
to
find
out
if
the
failure
of
this
man
to
have
a
speedy
trial
has
denied
him
his
constitutional
rights
and
if
it
has
the
next
question
is,
did
he
waive
it?
as
we
know
is
being
done
everyday
in
cases
generally.
as
an
illustration
from
harris
county,
texas,
there
are
probably
40
or
50
arrests
a
day
made
on
the
basis
of
searches
and
seizure
without
a
warrant
where
the
person
affected
give
his
consent
to
the
search
and
seizure
which
is
of
the
constitution
of
our
country
not
required
to
do.
he
waived
his
rights.
in
this
case,
did
he
waive
it?
ewell
by
this
court
some
three
years
ago
says,
whether
the
delay
alone
amounts
to
the
constitutional
deprivation
of
the
right,
it's
a
matter
to
be
determined
in
the
first
instance
in
the
trial
court
that
any
argument
to
the
contrary
in
this
court
is
premature.
and
that
this
court
would
not
pass
on
it
until
such
time
as
the
sentencing
judge
in
the
lower
court
had
heard
the
facts.
in
this
case,
the
record
--
let
me
say
has
been
prepared
by
stipulation
only.
and
i
certainly
compliment
the
gentleman
at
the
great
effort
he
has
made
to
get
it
here
and
i've
agreed
with
him
on
every
term.
not
one
time
have
i
disagreed
with
any
stipulation
he
wanted,
not
at
one
time
has
he
disagreed
with
any
the
highest
court,
even
as
late
as
today
in
order
to
correct
an
understatement
in
the
brief.
the
prosecuting
authorities
of
the
state
of
texas
never
knew
anything
about
this
procedure
in
the
supreme
court
or
in
the
misnamed
court
of
criminal
appeals
of
texas
until
after
the
application
for
writ
of
certiorari
was
filed
in
this
court;
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states.
if
you
read
the
records,
you
will
find
that
the
denial
of
the
relief
in
the
supreme
court
of
texas
was
on
june
the
21st
last
year.
i
mean
it
was
filed,
the
petition
was
filed
then
and
the
denial
was
on
the
28th
and
i
have
a
notice
in
my
file
here
to
show
in
counsel
that
it
wasn't
actually
mailed
down
there
until
injunction
of
case
worker
from
the
penitentiary
cede
it
on
june
the
22nd.
mr.
joe
s.
moss
yes
sir,
to
mandamus
to
trial
judge
to
dismiss
the
indictment
because
he
have
not
a
speedy
trial
after
seven
years
which
he
in
truth
and
in
fact
have
not
had
it
and
which
he
in
truth
and
in
fact
was
entitled
to
if
he
had
not
waived
it.
now,
so
we
know
that
five
or
six
days
elapsed
between
the
time
that
this
thing
was
filed
in
the
supreme
court
of
texas
and
the
decision
came
down
and
we
have
no
notice
on
it.
in
august
of
the
same
year,
the
petition
was
filed
up
here
and
we
did
get
notice
of
it
and
also
at
that
time
of
the
former
proceedings
in
the
supreme
court.
let
me
say
that
in
the
appendix
here
prepared
by
eminent
counsel,
the
petition
itself
has
contained
in
the
appendix
does
not
show
that
you
verified
and
it
does
not
show
that
contains
an
affidavit
of
indigency
or
poverty
as
we
call
it
in
texas.
the
texas
courts
hold
indigency
the
same
as
it
is
to
one
else.
there
is
no
price
on
the
remedies
down
there,
but
he
must
make
this
oath
and
in
this
particular
case,
he
did
not
do
so
even
though
in
my
brief
with
the
respondents.
i
invite
the
attention
of
the
court
to
the
facts
that
the
copy
furnish
me
in
my
office
did
contain
this
affidavit
and
did
contain
the
verification
of
the
facts.
but
that
was
not
sufficient
to
put
jurisdiction
into
the
courts
of
texas
to
prosecute
him
for
perjury
by
merely
giving
me
a
copy.
it
has
to
be
filed
in
the
court
which
he
studiously
avoided
doing.
and
that
is
significant
because
he
knew
if
he
had
done
that
that's
exactly
what
we
would've
done
to
him
because
we
know
of
$42,000.00
he
had
in
green
banks
and
other
matters
that
are
not
in
the
record.
even
the
sentence
he
served
at
the
present
time
is
--
we
had
his
counsel
said,
we
don't
know
what
that
is.
we're
not
concerned
with
it
but
what
are
we
going
to
do
about
it?
if
this
petitioner
had
been
tried
in
texas
at
any
time
rather
than
a
mistrial
only
three
things
could
happen.
he
could
be
acquitted,
he
can
be
filed
guilty
and
his
sentence
ran
concurrent
with
the
federal
sentence,
or
he
could
have
been
filed
guilty
and
the
sentence
has
been
cumulated
with
the
federal
sentence.
in
the
brief
as
the
member
of
the
bar
of
this
court
i
respectfully
represent
this
court
cumulation
is
rarely
done
by
the
judges
in
harris
county.
it
has
to
be
an
extreme
matter
before
it's
done.
but
in
ewell
this
court
said,
they'll
take
that
up
later
on
and
see
what
the
judge
does.
so,
with
approximately
five
more
years
jurisdiction
of
the
custody
of
this
prisoner
vested
in
the
federal
authorities.
it
conceivably
could
be
that
he
would
receive
a
sentence
that
would
be
expired
by
the
time
the
federal
government
gets
through
with
it
and
be
release
and
have
no
more
even
if
we
try
to.
likewise,
the
converse
is
true
if
we
wait
until
the
five
years
and
then
try
it.
under
the
law
of
texas,
if
he
received
10
years
which
is
the
maximum
he
could
receive
under
the
indictment.
the
trial
judge
has
the
discretion
to
give
him
credit
for
the
time
he
is
already
served
in
some
other
penitentiary.
and
you
can
see
if
he
did
that
which
i
represent
to
this
court
is
almost
always
uniformly
done
then
he
has
not
suffered
any
loss
of
any
right;
constitutional
or
otherwise.
on
the
other
hand,
if
it
is
cumulated
then
the
serious
question
comes
up
and
as
we
said
in
your
--
that
should
be
decided
whether
that
has
having
the
effect
on
it
should
be
decided
after
the
trial
judge
has
had
a
shot
at
him.
now,
as
to
when
we
get
him
and
try
him
can
only
be
one
of
two
occasions.
it
can
be
while
he
is
in
the
custody
of
united
states
and
let
us
see
what
that's
going
to
intake
expenses
with
two
marshals
down
there
in
back
exact
words
of
it
being
for
the
subsistence
and
shelter
of
the
prisoner
and
the
deputy
marshals
during
the
entire
time
of
their
absence
from
headquarters.
as
mr.
justice
white
observed
that
if
what
state
of
texas
cannot
afford
to
do
they
just
don't
have
the
money
but
i
think
in
all
candor
--
mr.
joe
s.
moss
sir?
mr.
joe
s.
moss
not
texas,
your
honor
it's
the
county
under
our
harris
county.
mr.
joe
s.
moss
absolutely,
it
went
up
the
movement
texas
4.7
last
friday
and
i
think
now
there's
a
movement
on
to
get
that
rescinding.
but
the
chance
is
still
good.
i'll
have
to
say
that
in
the
court.
i
have
made
to
discount
my
script.
the
cheap
sheets
are
still
valuable.
mr.
joe
s.
moss
now
--
mr.
joe
s.
moss
very
rarely.
where
he
is
in
the
--
oh,
we
would,
yes,
the
answer
to
your
question
is
yes.
we
would
if
we
want.
we
have
we
have
no
--
it's
no
--
it
seems
to
be
a
better
--
mr.
joe
s.
moss
yes,
sir.
mr.
joe
s.
moss
oh,
your
honor,
we
wouldn't
(inaudible)
other
thing
in
that
(inaudible).
mr.
joe
s.
moss
yes
sir,
we
get
him
when
we
want
him.
we
just
don't
want
this
fellow
until
we
can
get
him.
and
after
--
now,
the
day
that
that
warden
says
to
us,
“you
come
up
here
and
get
him;
you
can
have
him
we're
going
to
be
there
with
the
money
and
the
pistols
and
the
handcuffs.
and
we're
going
to
take
him
back
to
texas
and
we
go
to
somewhere
that
is
unless
your
honor
says
no.”
but
you
see
there
we
don't
have
to
feed
his
guards
and
we
don't
have
to
pay
their
expenses
but
to
and
fro.
we
would
just
send
an
officer
--
two
officers
and
they
bring
him
down
there,
of
course
it's
much
cheaper.
now,
it's
all
been
said
and
i
can
concur
with
the
saying
that
there
is
no
price
on
constitutional
rights
but
in
this
case
there
is
a
question
of
who's
going
to
do
the
paying.
that
is
to
say
is
it
going
to
be
the
petitioner,
is
it
going
to
be
the
state
of
texas
or
more
properly
stated
by
mr.
justice
marshall,
the
county
or
is
going
to
be
the
united
states
government
or
is
it
going
to
be
a
combination
of
two
or
more.
the
congress
says
that
these
prisoners
can
be
delivered
by
the
attorney
general
after
request
of
the
executive
authority
if
he
finds
it
in
the
public
interest
to
do
so.
if
you
brought
him
down
there,
i'll
have
serious
doubts
which
have
jurisdiction
of
him
within
the
meaning
of
jurisdiction.
i
don't
believe
there's
any
such
thing
as
about
a
percentage
of
jurisdiction,
he
either
have
it
ir
you
don't.
and
if
the
texas
courts
are
down
there
trying
to
litigate
with
the
prisoner
that's
in
custody
of
the
federal
authority
have
some
doubts
if
that
would
constitute
jurisdiction,
it
might
be
90%
jurisdiction
but
apparently
no
such
thing
exists.
now,
if
we
are
allowed
at
anytime.
now
or
later
to
try
the
this
man
at
anybody's
expense,
it
may
well
turn
out
if
that
shown
that
he
has
not
been
deprive
of
a
thing,
that
his
sentence
may
well
had
been
served.
he
can
get
his
--
mr.
joe
s.
moss
yes,
sir.
mr.
joe
s.
moss
that
is
true.
and
in
the
record
here
before
you,
you
will
find
that
the
solicitor
general
agrees
with
us
that
admittedly
upon
notice
of
this
procedure,
and
that
which
came
simultaneously
on
our
part
on
the
federal,
i
think,
there
was
three
days
difference
in
it.
i
might
say
in
all
fairness,
it's
about
a
two
day
delay
because
of
what
i
call
the
inefficiency
in
our
old
office,
but
anyhow
we
got
them
about
the
same
time
in
august
of
1967.
we
immediately
responded
to
their
petition,
sent
a
copy
to
the
solicitor
general
and
to
the
attorney
general
with
the
thought
that
both
of
these
people,
bearing
in
mind
that
this
petitioner
is
jointly
invalid
with
one
of
his
co-defendants,
named
taylor
who
is
in
the
atlanta
federal
penitentiary
and
seeks
no
relief,
he
don't
want
to
plea
for
trial,
your
honor.
the
attorney
general
gave
us
both,
so
we
wouldn't
have
to
have
two
trials,
we
might
try
them
all
at
the
same
time.
my
solution
to
this
thing
in
the
prayer
that
i
respectfully
present
to
you
is
that
this
be
remanded
to
the
state
court
in
some
fashion,
either
to
the
supreme
court
to
develop
the
facts
and
get
them
up
here
so
we
can
understand
what
rights
he
may
have
been
denied,
whether
it's
the
absence
of
witnesses
or
the
unlikelihood
of
contrary
of
sentences
of
what
it
may
be
or
if
that's
not
satisfactory
with
the
court
that
it
be
remanded
in
some
fashion
back
to
the
trial
court
with
the
instructions
to
the
state
of
texas
to
try
him
within
the
reasonable
length
of
time,
even
if
they
do
have
to
spend
the
money.
we're
getting
down
there
and
see.
now,
he
has
not
come
in
to
this
court
with
clean
hands.
he
did
not
file
his
affidavit
of
indigency
down
there
at
any
court,
no
way
he
did
file
it
with
me
and
i
have
it
here
in
duplicate
and
original.
but
that
does
not
give
the
state
courts
authority
to
indict
him
and
try
him
for
perjury
which
is
what
we
would
do
because
he
that
man
has
got
the
money,
and
did
have
it,
and
we
want
to
know
what
the
law
of
texas
what's
become
of
it.
mr.
joe
s.
moss
i
agree
with
him
a
100%.
mr.
joe
s.
moss
the
relevancy
of
the
argument
is
that
the
sovereign
state
of
texas
still
has
control
of
her
courts
and
the
amount
of
time
that
her
judges
and
so
on
operate
and
work
and
perform
their
duties.
and
one
of
the
requirements
of
the
state
of
texas
is
that
a
man
that's
able
to
do
so
pay
the
cost
of
his
procedure,
i'm
going
back
to
mandamus
procedure
here.
and
that
if
he
does
not
have
the
money
to
pay
it,
he
can
just
simply
make
an
affidavit
and
still
get
the
same
relief.
and
in
this
case,
this
prisoner
studiously
avoided
that
because
he
knew
we've
got
proof
of
what
he
did
with
$42,000.00,
and
then
when
he
had
it.
that
has
no
bearing
on
his
guilt
of
the
theft
his
charged
with,
it
has
bearing
on
the
fact
that
he
has
committed
a
fraud
upon
this
supreme
court
of
texas
by
sending
a
petition
down
there
without
any
affidavit
of
indigency,
and
then
file
in
one
up
here
where
we
clearly
have
no
jurisdiction
of
prosecuting
a
perjury.
mr.
joe
s.
moss
then
we
would
say,
don't
spend
your
money,
get
out
of
here,
goes
to
prison
authorities
would
say,
"we
have
a
benevolent
attitude
towards
you."
so
says
the
solicitor
general,
any
time
you
can
pay
the
expense,
we'll
take
you
down
there
and
he
can
use
the
word
private
party
of
the
prison
rules.
certainly,
he's
a
private
party
of
not
an
absolutely
in
dispense
to
be
necessary.
counsel
says
we've
ignored
this
request
for
a
speedy
trial
have
not
been
notified
and
every
time
that
we
try
him
within
two
weeks
in
the
time
we
get
here.
then
when
he
said
he's
indigent
about
a
year
ago,
a
little
over
a
year,
we
then
undertook
to
get
to
attorney
general
deliver
to
it.
i
might
say
with
all
candor,
that
statute
says
that
the
governor
or
executive
authority
of
the
state
must
make
the
request.
i
don't
know
whether
the
district
attorney's
office
is
the
executive
authority
within
the
contemplation
of
congress,
but
at
least
i
representing
the
district
attorney's
office
did
send
it
to
the
attorney
general
and
solicitor
general
asking
to
give
his
both
of,
so
we
can
tried
the
both
to
get
it
over.
mr.
joe
s.
moss
yes,
sir.
mr.
joe
s.
moss
yes,
sir.
mr.
joe
s.
moss
facts
developed
was
whether
or
not
he
has
been
deprived
of
these
asserted
constitutional
rights
--
mr.
joe
s.
moss
oh,
i'm
sure
it
be
done
if
your
honor
so
ordered,
but
you
bear
in
mind,
we
don't
have
the
united
states
government
of
the
party
to
this
suit.
he's
filed
the
lawsuit
against
the
district
judge
is
going
to
preside
over
his
trial
if
we
haven't
get
him,
and
there's
nobody
else.
mr.
joe
s.
moss
i
might
do
a
one
step
beyond
your
honor,
agree
with
you
and
go
on
to
step
further
that
they
leave
manner
one
from
a
state
judge.
i
know
of
the
matching
practice.
mr.
joe
s.
moss
yes.
mr.
joe
s.
moss
i'm
perfectly
willing
to.
mr.
joe
s.
moss
no,
we'll
do
that
now.
mr.
joe
s.
moss
oh,
yes,
sir.
you
just
let
me
know,
i'll
get
on
that
phone
and
have
that
money
up
in
here
and
nothing
less.
we'll
have
that
man
back
down
there
and
tried
in
two
weeks,
but
we
tried
and
quicker
now
if
we
thought
we
can
save
that
money.
mr.
joe
s.
moss
well,
he
will
be
entitled
to
a
hearing,
all
of
his
motion
to
dismiss
which
he
filed
in
the
trial
court,
which
counsel
says
we
ignored
and
he's
wrong,
we're
waiting
to
hear
it
because
this
says
he
hasn't
been
present
in
front
of
the
witnesses.
so
if
any
will
get
him
out,
we
have
ignored
it.
we're
going
to
give
him
the
hearing
on
that
too.
and
the
trial
judge
may
very
well
dismiss
it.
if
that
so
about
--
mr.
joe
s.
moss
two
weeks
ago
in
the
summer
case
--
mr.
joe
s.
moss
i
believe
counsel
--
i
agreed,
it's
15,000
and
with
counsel,
i
don't
remember
exactly
--
mr.
joe
s.
moss
well,
i
think
that's
right,
i'm
not
going
to
commit
here
but
it's
the
way
i
remembered.
mr.
joe
s.
moss
yes,
sir.
mr.
joe
s.
moss
oh!
not
under
our
jurisdiction
your
honor.
i
thought
you
were
through
(voice
overlap).
mr.
joe
s.
moss
to
the
best
of
my
ability,
the
answer
is
yes
and
yes,
your
honor.
but
let
me
qualify
it,
the
holder
of
the
first
(inaudible)
under
our
system
of
government
is
not
the
district
attorney.
mr.
joe
s.
moss
and
subject
to
their
approval
which
they
have
always
given,
as
far
as
i
know,
not
the
association
with
them.
they
have
always
given
us
the
money
to
go
get
a
witness
or
prisoner
or
any
other
thing,
wherever
want
it,
that
have
to
do
with
the
criminal
prosecution
by
simply
asking
for
it.
but
subject
to
that
qualification,
the
answer
is
an
unqualified,
yes
your
honor.
we'll
be
done
but
i
don't
know
of
the
two
or
three
others
that
are
in
the
same
shape
and
i
know
of
one
that's
in
reverse.
we
tried
to
follow
up
for
robbery
in
texas,
and
they
receive
about
nine
years
i
believe
in
arkansas
wanted
him
to
try
to
give
him
the
death
penalty.
so,
we
shipped
him
up
in
arkansas
with
an
agreement
that
if
they
don't
give
him
the
death
penalty,
they
will
bring
him
back.
mr.
joe
s.
moss
as
far
as
i
see
it,
no
sir.
mr.
joe
s.
moss
subject
to
that
qualification
now,
if
they
don't
give
us
the
money,
we
have
properly
notify
this
clerk
in
this
court
and
you
can
issue
the
writ
whatever
you
want
to
order
him
to
do
because
they're
not
part
of
the
suit.
it
makes
this
court
and
our
board
of
directors
have
given.
and
i'm
authorized
to
state
based
on
previous
experiences
that
they
certainly
will
do
it.
mr.
joe
s.
moss
not
inconsistent,
i
believe
--
mr.
joe
s.
moss
indeed.
and
then
do
it
after
the
trial
--
mr.
joe
s.
moss
--
you
see
that
could
very
well
be
dismissed.
i
have
every
belief
that
that
trial
judge
particularly
this
one
is
going
to
dismiss
it
on
the
motion
only
you'll
have
me
tried.
i
think
you'd
be
brought
dismiss
and
brought
right
back
to
federal
court,
i
mean
the
federal
penitentiary.
mr.
joe
s.
moss
in
other
matters,
we
have
a
pretrial
stuff
down
there,
there's
roughly
equivalent
to
the
federal
criminal
rules
and
we
got
from
search
matters
and
whatnot
timely
supressions
of
what
(inaudible)
other
than
go
out
on
that
ground
but
if
not
on
the
constitutional
ground.
but
in
any
event
i'm
going
out
the
record
sale
as
this
is
not
--
mr.
joe
s.
moss
i'm
going
to
agree
with
you,
your
honor.
mr.
joe
s.
moss
i
agree,
it
does
affect
this
treatment
in
the
prison
based
on
what
i'm
told,
i've
never
had
the
connections
with
the
mother
and
just
through
my
official
position,
but
i
know
from
the
talking
to
other
prisoners
that
it
does,
and
i
know
that
it
has
a
bearing
from
actual
experience,
don't
have
a
bearing
with
the
party
attorney.
as
to
what
other
charges
were
pending,
what
others
he
had
behind
him,
it
does
have
a
bearing.
but
please
don't
penalize
the
state
of
texas,
they
are
not
doing
that
to
him
as
the
federal
is
doing
it.
mr.
joe
s.
moss
well,
i
believe
here,
he
just
asked
for
dismissal
if
i
remembered
it
correctly.
mr.
joe
s.
moss
whatever
he
wants,
l
believed
we
gave
him
all
in
the
trial.
just
said
it
should
be
reversed
which
has
the
effect
of
putting
it
back
in
the
supreme
court
of
texas
whereas
here,
he
would
have
an
opportunity
to
further
develop
--
mr.
joe
s.
moss
those
are
writ
of
mandamus.
mr.
joe
s.
moss
yes,
sir.
mr.
joe
s.
moss
yes
sir.
and
if
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
joe
s.
moss
--
assigned
by
the
administrative
assistant
who
has
no
such
authority,
but
i'm
not
raising
that
at
all.
mr.
joe
s.
moss
after
the
fact
they
received,
we
submitted
down
there
they
just
turn
them
over
this
assistance.
you
mail
it
to
him
back
with
that
letter
attached
to
them.
i
noticed
they
did
gave
him
docket
number
10
in
that
particular
day.
we're
getting
large
writs
down
there
now,
in
the
way
pay
of
habeas
corpus
and
process
them
though
in
mandamus.
but
for
writ,
the
prisoners
today
here
are
better
educated.
they
were
to
down
there
(inaudible)
law
libraries,
all
of
which
i'm
in
favor
of.
this
prisoner
here
represent
himself
pro
se,
(inaudible).
he
really
put
it
in
me.
he
didn't
miss
a
thing.
states
--
the
respondent,
judge
hooey
whereby
the
decision
of
the
court
of
course,
asking
to
send
it
back
in
order
to
do
something
and
decide
under
ewell
whether
he's
been
denied
his
rights.
thank
you.
mr.
joe
s.
moss
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
there
is
absolutely
no
issue
here
about
the
right
of
this
petitioner
to
a
speedy
trial.
i,
as
a
representative
of
the
prosecution
in
the
concerned
jurisdiction,
harris
county
of
the
state
of
texas,
have
long
thought
that
it's
absolutely
outrageous
to
keep
things
like
this
hanging
over
the
heads
of
prisoners
who
are
incarcerated
under
the
jurisdiction
of
other
sovereigns
whether
it
be
a
state
or
other
federal
government.
likewise,
i
fully
realize
as
your
honors
have
noticed
in
some
of
your
recent
opinions
that
it
is
a
matter
of
common
knowledge
that
people
charge
with
crime
rarely
want
a
trial
at
all
and
if
they
must
have
one
they
hardly
ever
want
it
to
be
speedy.
delay
as
it
operates
to
the
disadvantage
of
the
prosecution
and
to
the
advantage
of
the
defendant
petitioner
here
because
the
memories
of
witnesses
dimmed
and
that
necessarily
affects
the
burden
that
the
prosecution
must
bear
in
establishing
the
guilt.
bearing
that
in
mind,
we
are
here
today
concerned
with
a
remedy.
we
are
going
to
try
to
find
out
if
the
failure
of
this
man
to
have
a
speedy
trial
has
denied
him
his
constitutional
rights
and
if
it
has
the
next
question
is,
did
he
waive
it?
as
we
know
is
being
done
everyday
in
cases
generally.
as
an
illustration
from
harris
county,
texas,
there
are
probably
40
or
50
arrests
a
day
made
on
the
basis
of
searches
and
seizure
without
a
warrant
where
the
person
affected
give
his
consent
to
the
search
and
seizure
which
is
of
the
constitution
of
our
country
not
required
to
do.
he
waived
his
rights.
in
this
case,
did
he
waive
it?
ewell
by
this
court
some
three
years
ago
says,
whether
the
delay
alone
amounts
to
the
constitutional
deprivation
of
the
right,
it's
a
matter
to
be
determined
in
the
first
instance
in
the
trial
court
that
any
argument
to
the
contrary
in
this
court
is
premature.
and
that
this
court
would
not
pass
on
it
until
such
time
as
the
sentencing
judge
in
the
lower
court
had
heard
the
facts.
in
this
case,
the
record
--
let
me
say
has
been
prepared
by
stipulation
only.
and
i
certainly
compliment
the
gentleman
at
the
great
effort
he
has
made
to
get
it
here
and
i've
agreed
with
him
on
every
term.
not
one
time
have
i
disagreed
with
any
stipulation
he
wanted,
not
at
one
time
has
he
disagreed
with
any
the
highest
court,
even
as
late
as
today
in
order
to
correct
an
understatement
in
the
brief.
the
prosecuting
authorities
of
the
state
of
texas
never
knew
anything
about
this
procedure
in
the
supreme
court
or
in
the
misnamed
court
of
criminal
appeals
of
texas
until
after
the
application
for
writ
of
certiorari
was
filed
in
this
court;
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states.
if
you
read
the
records,
you
will
find
that
the
denial
of
the
relief
in
the
supreme
court
of
texas
was
on
june
the
21st
last
year.
i
mean
it
was
filed,
the
petition
was
filed
then
and
the
denial
was
on
the
28th
and
i
have
a
notice
in
my
file
here
to
show
in
counsel
that
it
wasn't
actually
mailed
down
there
until
injunction
of
case
worker
from
the
penitentiary
cede
it
on
june
the
22nd.
mr.
joe
s.
moss
yes
sir,
to
mandamus
to
trial
judge
to
dismiss
the
indictment
because
he
have
not
a
speedy
trial
after
seven
years
which
he
in
truth
and
in
fact
have
not
had
it
and
which
he
in
truth
and
in
fact
was
entitled
to
if
he
had
not
waived
it.
now,
so
we
know
that
five
or
six
days
elapsed
between
the
time
that
this
thing
was
filed
in
the
supreme
court
of
texas
and
the
decision
came
down
and
we
have
no
notice
on
it.
in
august
of
the
same
year,
the
petition
was
filed
up
here
and
we
did
get
notice
of
it
and
also
at
that
time
of
the
former
proceedings
in
the
supreme
court.
let
me
say
that
in
the
appendix
here
prepared
by
eminent
counsel,
the
petition
itself
has
contained
in
the
appendix
does
not
show
that
you
verified
and
it
does
not
show
that
contains
an
affidavit
of
indigency
or
poverty
as
we
call
it
in
texas.
the
texas
courts
hold
indigency
the
same
as
it
is
to
one
else.
there
is
no
price
on
the
remedies
down
there,
but
he
must
make
this
oath
and
in
this
particular
case,
he
did
not
do
so
even
though
in
my
brief
with
the
respondents.
i
invite
the
attention
of
the
court
to
the
facts
that
the
copy
furnish
me
in
my
office
did
contain
this
affidavit
and
did
contain
the
verification
of
the
facts.
but
that
was
not
sufficient
to
put
jurisdiction
into
the
courts
of
texas
to
prosecute
him
for
perjury
by
merely
giving
me
a
copy.
it
has
to
be
filed
in
the
court
which
he
studiously
avoided
doing.
and
that
is
significant
because
he
knew
if
he
had
done
that
that's
exactly
what
we
would've
done
to
him
because
we
know
of
$42,000.00
he
had
in
green
banks
and
other
matters
that
are
not
in
the
record.
even
the
sentence
he
served
at
the
present
time
is
--
we
had
his
counsel
said,
we
don't
know
what
that
is.
we're
not
concerned
with
it
but
what
are
we
going
to
do
about
it?
if
this
petitioner
had
been
tried
in
texas
at
any
time
rather
than
a
mistrial
only
three
things
could
happen.
he
could
be
acquitted,
he
can
be
filed
guilty
and
his
sentence
ran
concurrent
with
the
federal
sentence,
or
he
could
have
been
filed
guilty
and
the
sentence
has
been
cumulated
with
the
federal
sentence.
in
the
brief
as
the
member
of
the
bar
of
this
court
i
respectfully
represent
this
court
cumulation
is
rarely
done
by
the
judges
in
harris
county.
it
has
to
be
an
extreme
matter
before
it's
done.
but
in
ewell
this
court
said,
they'll
take
that
up
later
on
and
see
what
the
judge
does.
so,
with
approximately
five
more
years
jurisdiction
of
the
custody
of
this
prisoner
vested
in
the
federal
authorities.
it
conceivably
could
be
that
he
would
receive
a
sentence
that
would
be
expired
by
the
time
the
federal
government
gets
through
with
it
and
be
release
and
have
no
more
even
if
we
try
to.
likewise,
the
converse
is
true
if
we
wait
until
the
five
years
and
then
try
it.
under
the
law
of
texas,
if
he
received
10
years
which
is
the
maximum
he
could
receive
under
the
indictment.
the
trial
judge
has
the
discretion
to
give
him
credit
for
the
time
he
is
already
served
in
some
other
penitentiary.
and
you
can
see
if
he
did
that
which
i
represent
to
this
court
is
almost
always
uniformly
done
then
he
has
not
suffered
any
loss
of
any
right;
constitutional
or
otherwise.
on
the
other
hand,
if
it
is
cumulated
then
the
serious
question
comes
up
and
as
we
said
in
your
--
that
should
be
decided
whether
that
has
having
the
effect
on
it
should
be
decided
after
the
trial
judge
has
had
a
shot
at
him.
now,
as
to
when
we
get
him
and
try
him
can
only
be
one
of
two
occasions.
it
can
be
while
he
is
in
the
custody
of
united
states
and
let
us
see
what
that's
going
to
intake
expenses
with
two
marshals
down
there
in
back
exact
words
of
it
being
for
the
subsistence
and
shelter
of
the
prisoner
and
the
deputy
marshals
during
the
entire
time
of
their
absence
from
headquarters.
as
mr.
justice
white
observed
that
if
what
state
of
texas
cannot
afford
to
do
they
just
don't
have
the
money
but
i
think
in
all
candor
--
mr.
joe
s.
moss
sir?
mr.
joe
s.
moss
not
texas,
your
honor
it's
the
county
under
our
harris
county.
mr.
joe
s.
moss
absolutely,
it
went
up
the
movement
texas
4.7
last
friday
and
i
think
now
there's
a
movement
on
to
get
that
rescinding.
but
the
chance
is
still
good.
i'll
have
to
say
that
in
the
court.
i
have
made
to
discount
my
script.
the
cheap
sheets
are
still
valuable.
mr.
joe
s.
moss
now
--
mr.
joe
s.
moss
very
rarely.
where
he
is
in
the
--
oh,
we
would,
yes,
the
answer
to
your
question
is
yes.
we
would
if
we
want.
we
have
we
have
no
--
it's
no
--
it
seems
to
be
a
better
--
mr.
joe
s.
moss
yes,
sir.
mr.
joe
s.
moss
oh,
your
honor,
we
wouldn't
(inaudible)
other
thing
in
that
(inaudible).
mr.
joe
s.
moss
yes
sir,
we
get
him
when
we
want
him.
we
just
don't
want
this
fellow
until
we
can
get
him.
and
after
--
now,
the
day
that
that
warden
says
to
us,
“you
come
up
here
and
get
him;
you
can
have
him
we're
going
to
be
there
with
the
money
and
the
pistols
and
the
handcuffs.
and
we're
going
to
take
him
back
to
texas
and
we
go
to
somewhere
that
is
unless
your
honor
says
no.”
but
you
see
there
we
don't
have
to
feed
his
guards
and
we
don't
have
to
pay
their
expenses
but
to
and
fro.
we
would
just
send
an
officer
--
two
officers
and
they
bring
him
down
there,
of
course
it's
much
cheaper.
now,
it's
all
been
said
and
i
can
concur
with
the
saying
that
there
is
no
price
on
constitutional
rights
but
in
this
case
there
is
a
question
of
who's
going
to
do
the
paying.
that
is
to
say
is
it
going
to
be
the
petitioner,
is
it
going
to
be
the
state
of
texas
or
more
properly
stated
by
mr.
justice
marshall,
the
county
or
is
going
to
be
the
united
states
government
or
is
it
going
to
be
a
combination
of
two
or
more.
the
congress
says
that
these
prisoners
can
be
delivered
by
the
attorney
general
after
request
of
the
executive
authority
if
he
finds
it
in
the
public
interest
to
do
so.
if
you
brought
him
down
there,
i'll
have
serious
doubts
which
have
jurisdiction
of
him
within
the
meaning
of
jurisdiction.
i
don't
believe
there's
any
such
thing
as
about
a
percentage
of
jurisdiction,
he
either
have
it
ir
you
don't.
and
if
the
texas
courts
are
down
there
trying
to
litigate
with
the
prisoner
that's
in
custody
of
the
federal
authority
have
some
doubts
if
that
would
constitute
jurisdiction,
it
might
be
90%
jurisdiction
but
apparently
no
such
thing
exists.
now,
if
we
are
allowed
at
anytime.
now
or
later
to
try
the
this
man
at
anybody's
expense,
it
may
well
turn
out
if
that
shown
that
he
has
not
been
deprive
of
a
thing,
that
his
sentence
may
well
had
been
served.
he
can
get
his
--
mr.
joe
s.
moss
yes,
sir.
mr.
joe
s.
moss
that
is
true.
and
in
the
record
here
before
you,
you
will
find
that
the
solicitor
general
agrees
with
us
that
admittedly
upon
notice
of
this
procedure,
and
that
which
came
simultaneously
on
our
part
on
the
federal,
i
think,
there
was
three
days
difference
in
it.
i
might
say
in
all
fairness,
it's
about
a
two
day
delay
because
of
what
i
call
the
inefficiency
in
our
old
office,
but
anyhow
we
got
them
about
the
same
time
in
august
of
1967.
we
immediately
responded
to
their
petition,
sent
a
copy
to
the
solicitor
general
and
to
the
attorney
general
with
the
thought
that
both
of
these
people,
bearing
in
mind
that
this
petitioner
is
jointly
invalid
with
one
of
his
co-defendants,
named
taylor
who
is
in
the
atlanta
federal
penitentiary
and
seeks
no
relief,
he
don't
want
to
plea
for
trial,
your
honor.
the
attorney
general
gave
us
both,
so
we
wouldn't
have
to
have
two
trials,
we
might
try
them
all
at
the
same
time.
my
solution
to
this
thing
in
the
prayer
that
i
respectfully
present
to
you
is
that
this
be
remanded
to
the
state
court
in
some
fashion,
either
to
the
supreme
court
to
develop
the
facts
and
get
them
up
here
so
we
can
understand
what
rights
he
may
have
been
denied,
whether
it's
the
absence
of
witnesses
or
the
unlikelihood
of
contrary
of
sentences
of
what
it
may
be
or
if
that's
not
satisfactory
with
the
court
that
it
be
remanded
in
some
fashion
back
to
the
trial
court
with
the
instructions
to
the
state
of
texas
to
try
him
within
the
reasonable
length
of
time,
even
if
they
do
have
to
spend
the
money.
we're
getting
down
there
and
see.
now,
he
has
not
come
in
to
this
court
with
clean
hands.
he
did
not
file
his
affidavit
of
indigency
down
there
at
any
court,
no
way
he
did
file
it
with
me
and
i
have
it
here
in
duplicate
and
original.
but
that
does
not
give
the
state
courts
authority
to
indict
him
and
try
him
for
perjury
which
is
what
we
would
do
because
he
that
man
has
got
the
money,
and
did
have
it,
and
we
want
to
know
what
the
law
of
texas
what's
become
of
it.
mr.
joe
s.
moss
i
agree
with
him
a
100%.
mr.
joe
s.
moss
the
relevancy
of
the
argument
is
that
the
sovereign
state
of
texas
still
has
control
of
her
courts
and
the
amount
of
time
that
her
judges
and
so
on
operate
and
work
and
perform
their
duties.
and
one
of
the
requirements
of
the
state
of
texas
is
that
a
man
that's
able
to
do
so
pay
the
cost
of
his
procedure,
i'm
going
back
to
mandamus
procedure
here.
and
that
if
he
does
not
have
the
money
to
pay
it,
he
can
just
simply
make
an
affidavit
and
still
get
the
same
relief.
and
in
this
case,
this
prisoner
studiously
avoided
that
because
he
knew
we've
got
proof
of
what
he
did
with
$42,000.00,
and
then
when
he
had
it.
that
has
no
bearing
on
his
guilt
of
the
theft
his
charged
with,
it
has
bearing
on
the
fact
that
he
has
committed
a
fraud
upon
this
supreme
court
of
texas
by
sending
a
petition
down
there
without
any
affidavit
of
indigency,
and
then
file
in
one
up
here
where
we
clearly
have
no
jurisdiction
of
prosecuting
a
perjury.
mr.
joe
s.
moss
then
we
would
say,
don't
spend
your
money,
get
out
of
here,
goes
to
prison
authorities
would
say,
"we
have
a
benevolent
attitude
towards
you."
so
says
the
solicitor
general,
any
time
you
can
pay
the
expense,
we'll
take
you
down
there
and
he
can
use
the
word
private
party
of
the
prison
rules.
certainly,
he's
a
private
party
of
not
an
absolutely
in
dispense
to
be
necessary.
counsel
says
we've
ignored
this
request
for
a
speedy
trial
have
not
been
notified
and
every
time
that
we
try
him
within
two
weeks
in
the
time
we
get
here.
then
when
he
said
he's
indigent
about
a
year
ago,
a
little
over
a
year,
we
then
undertook
to
get
to
attorney
general
deliver
to
it.
i
might
say
with
all
candor,
that
statute
says
that
the
governor
or
executive
authority
of
the
state
must
make
the
request.
i
don't
know
whether
the
district
attorney's
office
is
the
executive
authority
within
the
contemplation
of
congress,
but
at
least
i
representing
the
district
attorney's
office
did
send
it
to
the
attorney
general
and
solicitor
general
asking
to
give
his
both
of,
so
we
can
tried
the
both
to
get
it
over.
mr.
joe
s.
moss
yes,
sir.
mr.
joe
s.
moss
yes,
sir.
mr.
joe
s.
moss
facts
developed
was
whether
or
not
he
has
been
deprived
of
these
asserted
constitutional
rights
--
mr.
joe
s.
moss
oh,
i'm
sure
it
be
done
if
your
honor
so
ordered,
but
you
bear
in
mind,
we
don't
have
the
united
states
government
of
the
party
to
this
suit.
he's
filed
the
lawsuit
against
the
district
judge
is
going
to
preside
over
his
trial
if
we
haven't
get
him,
and
there's
nobody
else.
mr.
joe
s.
moss
i
might
do
a
one
step
beyond
your
honor,
agree
with
you
and
go
on
to
step
further
that
they
leave
manner
one
from
a
state
judge.
i
know
of
the
matching
practice.
mr.
joe
s.
moss
yes.
mr.
joe
s.
moss
i'm
perfectly
willing
to.
mr.
joe
s.
moss
no,
we'll
do
that
now.
mr.
joe
s.
moss
oh,
yes,
sir.
you
just
let
me
know,
i'll
get
on
that
phone
and
have
that
money
up
in
here
and
nothing
less.
we'll
have
that
man
back
down
there
and
tried
in
two
weeks,
but
we
tried
and
quicker
now
if
we
thought
we
can
save
that
money.
mr.
joe
s.
moss
well,
he
will
be
entitled
to
a
hearing,
all
of
his
motion
to
dismiss
which
he
filed
in
the
trial
court,
which
counsel
says
we
ignored
and
he's
wrong,
we're
waiting
to
hear
it
because
this
says
he
hasn't
been
present
in
front
of
the
witnesses.
so
if
any
will
get
him
out,
we
have
ignored
it.
we're
going
to
give
him
the
hearing
on
that
too.
and
the
trial
judge
may
very
well
dismiss
it.
if
that
so
about
--
mr.
joe
s.
moss
two
weeks
ago
in
the
summer
case
--
mr.
joe
s.
moss
i
believe
counsel
--
i
agreed,
it's
15,000
and
with
counsel,
i
don't
remember
exactly
--
mr.
joe
s.
moss
well,
i
think
that's
right,
i'm
not
going
to
commit
here
but
it's
the
way
i
remembered.
mr.
joe
s.
moss
yes,
sir.
mr.
joe
s.
moss
oh!
not
under
our
jurisdiction
your
honor.
i
thought
you
were
through
(voice
overlap).
mr.
joe
s.
moss
to
the
best
of
my
ability,
the
answer
is
yes
and
yes,
your
honor.
but
let
me
qualify
it,
the
holder
of
the
first
(inaudible)
under
our
system
of
government
is
not
the
district
attorney.
mr.
joe
s.
moss
and
subject
to
their
approval
which
they
have
always
given,
as
far
as
i
know,
not
the
association
with
them.
they
have
always
given
us
the
money
to
go
get
a
witness
or
prisoner
or
any
other
thing,
wherever
want
it,
that
have
to
do
with
the
criminal
prosecution
by
simply
asking
for
it.
but
subject
to
that
qualification,
the
answer
is
an
unqualified,
yes
your
honor.
we'll
be
done
but
i
don't
know
of
the
two
or
three
others
that
are
in
the
same
shape
and
i
know
of
one
that's
in
reverse.
we
tried
to
follow
up
for
robbery
in
texas,
and
they
receive
about
nine
years
i
believe
in
arkansas
wanted
him
to
try
to
give
him
the
death
penalty.
so,
we
shipped
him
up
in
arkansas
with
an
agreement
that
if
they
don't
give
him
the
death
penalty,
they
will
bring
him
back.
mr.
joe
s.
moss
as
far
as
i
see
it,
no
sir.
mr.
joe
s.
moss
subject
to
that
qualification
now,
if
they
don't
give
us
the
money,
we
have
properly
notify
this
clerk
in
this
court
and
you
can
issue
the
writ
whatever
you
want
to
order
him
to
do
because
they're
not
part
of
the
suit.
it
makes
this
court
and
our
board
of
directors
have
given.
and
i'm
authorized
to
state
based
on
previous
experiences
that
they
certainly
will
do
it.
mr.
joe
s.
moss
not
inconsistent,
i
believe
--
mr.
joe
s.
moss
indeed.
and
then
do
it
after
the
trial
--
mr.
joe
s.
moss
--
you
see
that
could
very
well
be
dismissed.
i
have
every
belief
that
that
trial
judge
particularly
this
one
is
going
to
dismiss
it
on
the
motion
only
you'll
have
me
tried.
i
think
you'd
be
brought
dismiss
and
brought
right
back
to
federal
court,
i
mean
the
federal
penitentiary.
mr.
joe
s.
moss
in
other
matters,
we
have
a
pretrial
stuff
down
there,
there's
roughly
equivalent
to
the
federal
criminal
rules
and
we
got
from
search
matters
and
whatnot
timely
supressions
of
what
(inaudible)
other
than
go
out
on
that
ground
but
if
not
on
the
constitutional
ground.
but
in
any
event
i'm
going
out
the
record
sale
as
this
is
not
--
mr.
joe
s.
moss
i'm
going
to
agree
with
you,
your
honor.
mr.
joe
s.
moss
i
agree,
it
does
affect
this
treatment
in
the
prison
based
on
what
i'm
told,
i've
never
had
the
connections
with
the
mother
and
just
through
my
official
position,
but
i
know
from
the
talking
to
other
prisoners
that
it
does,
and
i
know
that
it
has
a
bearing
from
actual
experience,
don't
have
a
bearing
with
the
party
attorney.
as
to
what
other
charges
were
pending,
what
others
he
had
behind
him,
it
does
have
a
bearing.
but
please
don't
penalize
the
state
of
texas,
they
are
not
doing
that
to
him
as
the
federal
is
doing
it.
mr.
joe
s.
moss
well,
i
believe
here,
he
just
asked
for
dismissal
if
i
remembered
it
correctly.
mr.
joe
s.
moss
whatever
he
wants,
l
believed
we
gave
him
all
in
the
trial.
just
said
it
should
be
reversed
which
has
the
effect
of
putting
it
back
in
the
supreme
court
of
texas
whereas
here,
he
would
have
an
opportunity
to
further
develop
--
mr.
joe
s.
moss
those
are
writ
of
mandamus.
mr.
joe
s.
moss
yes,
sir.
mr.
joe
s.
moss
yes
sir.
and
if
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
joe
s.
moss
--
assigned
by
the
administrative
assistant
who
has
no
such
authority,
but
i'm
not
raising
that
at
all.
mr.
joe
s.
moss
after
the
fact
they
received,
we
submitted
down
there
they
just
turn
them
over
this
assistance.
you
mail
it
to
him
back
with
that
letter
attached
to
them.
i
noticed
they
did
gave
him
docket
number
10
in
that
particular
day.
we're
getting
large
writs
down
there
now,
in
the
way
pay
of
habeas
corpus
and
process
them
though
in
mandamus.
but
for
writ,
the
prisoners
today
here
are
better
educated.
they
were
to
down
there
(inaudible)
law
libraries,
all
of
which
i'm
in
favor
of.
this
prisoner
here
represent
himself
pro
se,
(inaudible).
he
really
put
it
in
me.
he
didn't
miss
a
thing.
states
--
the
respondent,
judge
hooey
whereby
the
decision
of
the
court
of
course,
asking
to
send
it
back
in
order
to
do
something
and
decide
under
ewell
whether
he's
been
denied
his
rights.
thank
you.
