chief

we
would
like
to
have
them
mr.
wright.
we
would
like
to
have
them
if
they're
available.
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
contemplates
the
state
will
make
the
application,
does
it
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
mr.
moss.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
mr.
moss
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
suppose
if
you
--
if
you
needed
a
witness
or
two
from
the
same
state
to
convict
him,
you
would
find
the
money,
would
you
not
to
bring
on
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
do
you
have
to
say
about
professor
wight's
argument
that
he'd
been
entitled
to
this
remedy,
whether
he
is
with
some
millionaire
or
whether
he
is
a
pauper?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
then
what
is
the
relevance
here,
the
argument
you're
just
making
about
he
has
made
no
affidavit
of
indigency?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
suppose
he
admittedly,
he
was
a
wealthy
man
and
he
made
the
demand
for
speedy
trial
and
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
have
any
idea
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
have
any
idea
how
many
other
are
similarly
situated
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
15,000?
but
now,
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
you
say
that
you
would
bring
this
man
back
immediately
and
afford
him
of
speedy
trial?
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
that
mean
that
principle
would
you
apply
it
also
to
all
the
15,000?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i'm
--
let's
say
all
of
those
that
are
under
your
jurisdiction,
can
you
say
to
us
that
the
fact
that
you
will
agree
to
bring
him
back
and
try
and
give
him
a
speedy
trial
and
pay
the
expenses
incurred
by
it,
would
leave
to
the
same
kind
of
treatment
to
other
people
who
are
similarly
situated
from
the
state
of
texas?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
wright.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
furthermore,
haven't
he
asked
for
a
speedy
trial?
hadn't
he
asked
for
a
trial
a
couple
of
years
ago?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that
is
something
more
in
your
case
it
seems
to
me.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
suppose
professor,
if
we
just
remanded
this
case
to
the
texas
courts
without
meeting
the
constitutional
issue
and
they
just
dismiss
the
case,
that
this
constitutional
question
would
go
down
to
drain,
wouldn't
it?
then,
we
never
would
have
it
determined.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
what
i
mean.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
i
know
but
we've
got
it
here
and
you
say
that
it's
properly
here
and
if
it
is
here,
it
wouldn't
be
fulfilling
our
function
would
it
to
just
return
it
to
the
texas
court
where
it
could
be
dismiss
without
resolution
of
that
issue?
