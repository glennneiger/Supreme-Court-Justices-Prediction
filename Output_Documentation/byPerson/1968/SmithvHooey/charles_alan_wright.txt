mr.
charles
alan
wright
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
here
is
whether
or
not
a
state
is
excuse
from
the
duty
that
would
otherwise
be
upon
it
to
give
a
speedy
trial
to
a
person
it
has
indicted
on
the
state
charge
because
that
person
is
during
pendency
of
the
indictment
in
the
federal
penitentiary
on
some
other
charge.
the
texas
supreme
court
in
a
consistent
line
of
cases
has
ruled
that
it
is
not
that
although
it
is
bound
to
give
a
speedy
charge
to
a
person
under
texas
indictment
who
was
under
--
who
was
in
a
texas
prison
that
it
is
not
required
as
some
other
sovereign
to
produce
a
prisoner
in
order
that
may
try
him.
i
propose
to
spend
unless
the
court
has
its
questions
on
the
matter
very
little
time
on
the
merits
in
part
because
i
do
not
think
that
there
is
an
issue
as
between
my
friends
for
the
state
and
myself
on
the
underlying
constitutional
principle.
i
do
not
find
such
an
issue
drawn
in
the
brief
and
i
believe
that
mr.
moss
speaks
for
the
respondent
that
it
will
appear
that
we
agree
on
the
basic
constitutional
point.
now,
of
course
the
agreement
of
counsel
can't
put
an
authoritative
construction
on
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
but
i
would
think
that
on
the
substantive
point,
your
decision
last
term
speaking
through
justice
marshall
in
the
case
of
page
versus
barber
is
quite
decisive
that
the
problem
decided
in
page
and
barber
is
really
indistinguishable
from
the
problem
of
this
case
presents
that
where
someone
who
is
needed
for
a
criminal
proceeding
is
in
the
custody
of
some
other
sovereign
that
at
least
the
state
has
the
duty
to
make
a
reasonable
effort
to
endeavor
to
getting
back
from
the
prison
in
which
he
presently
languishes.
a
reasonable
effort
is
all
that
page
and
barber
requires
to
solve
that
we
contend
for
us
the
rule
in
this
case
since
it
is
i
think
quite
clear
here
that
texas
has
made
no
effort
to
get
this
petitioner
back
from
leavenworth.
i
do
want
to
call
to
the
court's
attention
a
study
of
this
matter
that
it
is
not
referred
to
an
either
of
the
briefs
because
it
has
become
available
only
very
recently
and
that
is
a
63-page
national
survey
of
detainers
prepared
by
the
national
defender
project
of
the
national
legal
aid
and
defender
association.
that
association
made
copies
available
both
to
counsel
for
the
respondent
and
to
myself
and
i'm
sure
would
be
glad
to
make
copies
of
their
very
comprehensive
survey
available
to
the
court.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i'm
sure
that
they
can
be
made
available
and
i
will
see
that
that
happens
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
there
is
an
issue
between
my
friends
and
myself.
i'm
not
sure
whether
it
goes
to
substance
or
to
procedure
that
has
to
do
with
the
effect
of
the
solvency
of
a
person
under
the
state
charges.
the
state
makes
the
argument
that
they
do
not
know
when
the
present
petitioner
became
indigent
and
that
since
the
indictment
that
they
returned
against
him
in
1960
alleged
that
he
had
recently
acquired
by
theft
some
$42,000.00
unless
he
notified
them
that
he
were
indigent,
they
would
have
no
reason
to
know
that
he
was
indigent.
and
therefore,
no
reason
to
think
that
he
could
not
finance
his
own
way
to
houston
in
order
to
stand
trial.
the
--
in
the
view
that
petitioner
submits
of
that
the
fact
is
of
his
indigency
is
irrelevant
that
the
obligation
to
give
a
speedy
trial
extends
as
well
to
a
prisoner
or
in
person
under
indictment
who
is
rich
as
it
does
to
one
who
is
without
funds.
it's
a
little
hard
to
see,
in
fact,
what
good
it
would
have
done
the
petitioner
if
he
had
had
funds
the
states
says,
“well,
we
would've
given
him
a
trial
within
two
weeks
anytime
he
showed
up
in
houston.”
and
if
he'd
the
money
to
pay
his
way
from
leavenworth
to
houston
and
it
said
to
himself,
“oh,
i
think
i
would
go
down
to
houston
and
stand
trial.”
i
imagine
that
the
federal
prison
authorities
at
leavenworth
would've
taken
a
rather
deem
view
of
that.
that
they
would
not
have
allowed
him
to
go
unless
the
state
had
made
an
effort,
we're
told
in
memorandum
of
the
solicitor
general.
but
ordinarily,
the
policy
of
the
bureau
of
prisons
is
to
require
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
at
prosequendum
from
the
state
court
and
that
when
that
comes,
the
bureau
then
is
very
cooperative
and
almost
invariably
will
make
the
prisoner
available.
but
it
isn't
the
fact
that
mr.
smith
did
or
did
not
have
funds
that
in
my
submission
is
significant.
it
is
the
fact
the
he
was
confined
by
the
federal
authorities
and
that
some
request
from
the
state
authorities
was
necessary
before
the
federal
authorities
would
let
him
out
of
the
walls
of
leavenworth
to
go
to
houston
to
stand
trial.
there
are
obvious
problems
in
this
case
because
the
record
is
not
very
frequent.
i'm
very
aware
of
that
from
the
outset
of
the
case
and
the
state
suggest
in
its
brief
because
of
the
skimpiness
of
the
record
it
--
this
court
either
should
dismiss
the
writ
as
improvidently
granted
or
should
remand
the
case
to
the
--
either
the
texas
supreme
court
or
state
trial
court
for
further
fact
findings.
i
submit
however
that
the
record
skimpy
as
it
is
presents
every
fact
that
is
necessary
for
decision
of
the
comparatively
narrow
issue
that
the
case
presents
that
it
would
be
nice
to
have
a
good
deal
of
background
to
this
day,
though
i'm
his
counsel
do
not
know
on
what
federal
offense
my
client
was
convicted
but
i
can't
think
it
really
makes
any
difference
whether
he
was
in
leavenworth
on
one
crime
or
another
that
these
are
matters
of
color
only.
and
that
the
basic
legal
facts
are
perfectly
clear
in
the
record
that
he
was
indicted
in
april
of
1960
in
harris
county
for
a
crime
allegedly
committed
in
may
of
1959
that
as
of
that
time
he
was
a
federal
prisoner
that
the
sheriff
of
harris
county
wrote
to
leavenworth
and
was
advised
that
he
would
not
be
released
until
1970.
the
beginning
at
least
in
march
of
1961,
the
petitioner
has
made
repeated
request
to
have
a
speedy
trial
that
he
has
not
been
brought
on
for
trial
at
any
time
that
there
has
now
a
lapse
some
eight
years
and
that
the
time
is
long
since
past
when
it
is
possible
to
give
the
petitioner
the
kind
of
trial
to
which
he's
constitutionally
entitled.
so
that
in
our
submission,
the
writ
was
providently
granted
and
the
record
is
ample
to
decide
the
matter
that
is
before
you.
the
record
in
addition
to
being
skimpy
is
somewhat
informal.
the
petitioner
addressed
his
writ
of
mandamus
in
the
state
court
to
a
non-existent
court,
the
texas
criminal
court
of
appeals
and
it
was
transferred
by
that
court
informally
to
the
texas
supreme
court
as
the
texas
supreme
court
has
jurisdiction
in
these
matters.
the
texas
supreme
court
entered
no
formal
order
instead
the
administrative
assistant
to
the
court
wrote
to
the
petitioners
saying
that
the,
“your
petitioners
today
have
been
denied”
referring
to
the
cooper
case
and
the
lawrence
case
as
authority
for
the
denial.”
but
the
mere
fact
of
informality
in
the
state
court
proceedings
does
not
mean
that
we
have
any
less
a
final
judgment
of
the
highest
court
of
the
state
in
which
decision
can
be
had.
i
refer
and
hold
the
case
of
in
re
summers
for
example
in
325
f.2d
in
which
was
a
letter
from
the
chief
justice.
that
the
secretary
of
the
illinois
bar
committee
that
was
the
definitive
action
of
the
illinois
court
and
this
court
held
nonetheless
that
it
had
--
that
that
letter
was
a
sufficient
--
were
definitive
act
to
permit
review
under
section
1257.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
the
record
certainly
shows
that.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
that's
--
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge,
it's
correct,
justice
stewart.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
would
read
it
somewhat
different
with
respect
your
honor
it
seems
to
me
that
what
general
griswold
has
said
there
is
that
occasionally
this
has
happen
to
the
instance
of
the
prisoner.
but
that
a
prisoner
not
later
than
law
can
hardly
be
expected
to
know
that
this
procedure
was
available.
he
was
doing
but
to
him
where
the
obvious
things.
he
was
beseeching
the
harris
county
authorities
with
motions
and
letters
of
various
cons
as
been
told
in
the
response.
that
under
the
published
rules
of
the
board
of
prisons,
the
prisoner
is
not
advised
that,
“if
you'll
ask
us
we
will
come
to
your
assistance.”
instead
the
rules
speak
only
that
a
prisoner
will
ordinary
be
made
available
if
the
state
authorities
requested.
and
i
think
that
it
would
be
asking
a
good
deal
to
say
that
the
petitioner
has
waived
any
right
he
had
because
he
did
not
pursue
a
remedy
that
even
a
reasonably
observant
person
would
not
have
known
existed.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
there
is
“not”
omitted
there.
you
will
see
that
the
“not”
appears
at
page
25
of
our
brief
where
we
have
quoted
it
but
here
in
the
appendix,
it
was
omitted
unfortunately
under
the
procedure
in
indigence
cases
counsel
do
not
get
to
proofread
the
briefs.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
that
is
what
i
should
say,
yes,
it's
what
the
original
file
says.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
do
not
--
do
not
gather
that
though
i
don't
think
that
what
is
said
here
is
definitive
one
way
or
the
other.
i
--
as
i
read
this,
what
the
solicitor
general
griswold
is
saying
is
that
occasionally
if
the
prisoner
asked
us,
we'll
write
to
the
local
prosecutor
and
say,
“if
you
ask
for
writ
of
habeas
--
if
you
get
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
at
prosequendum
in
your
state
court,
then
we'll
make
this
prisoner
available
so
that
you
may
try
him.”
i
do
not
think
it
is
saying
at
all
that
the
united
states
is
acting
simply
on
the
request
to
the
prisoner
whether
the
prisoner
at
--
in
harris
county
and
say,
“one
state
authority,
here
he
is,
go
ahead.”
mr.
charles
alan
wright
then
the
practice
is
that
the
writ
ordinary
would
be
honored
the
state
is
required
to
pay
the
expenses
of
transporting
him
and
guards
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
gather
its
one
thing
they're
not
interested
in
doing,
yes.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
it
says
in
some
instances
to
mitigate
because
of
the
state,
the
bureau
of
prison
has
removed
an
inmate
to
a
facility
close
to
the
site
of
prosecution.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
well,
there
is
a
statutory
procedure
for
it
section
4085
and
there
are
also
rules
of
the
board
of
prisons
that
are
issued
from
time
to
time.
a
bulletin
that
comes
out
now
and
again
that
is
made
available
to
state
authorities
who
inquire
telling
exactly
what
the
procedure
is.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes.
thank
you,
your
honors.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
i
should
speak
immediately
of
the
question
of
what
the
relief
is
that
has
been
asked
since
there
is
apparently
some
concern
about
that.
the
only
relief
that
petitioner
asked
for,
for
the
texas
court
was
that
the
indictment
against
him
be
dismissed.
that
is
all
that
is
before
you
in
this
proceeding.
i
call
your
attention
to
the
final
paragraph
of
the
petition
for
mandamus,
reprinted
at
page
4
of
the
brown
appendix.
now
at
prior
time
since
march
17,
1961
according
to
the
record,
he
has
asked
variously
either
for
trial
or
for
dismissal,
but
the
present
proceeding
is
a
request
for
dismissal
only.
that
of
course
does
not
foreclose
what
this
court
may
do.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes,
surely.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
that
is
the
case
of
lawrence
v.
texas.
the
opinion
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
that
is
not
this
case,
no.
the
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
the
letter
from
the
administrative
assistant
of
the
court
said
we
cite
you
the
cooper
v.
state
and
the
lawrence
v.
state,
we
are
enclosing
a
copy
of
the
per
curium
opinion
in
the
latter
case.
in
fact,
i
think
--
as
a
matter
of
personal
privilege,
i
will
say
that
i
did
not
include
the
lawrence
opinion
as
a
part
of
the
appendix
to
be
printed
but
somehow
it
showed
up
in
the
printed
appendix.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
it
was
an
enclosure
with
the
letter,
yes
and
i
submit
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
that
is
correct
justice
brennan.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
petitioner
asked
that.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
that
is
correct,
except
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
think
not.
i
think
that's
what
klopfer
held.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
think
klopfer
v.
north
carolina,
there
is
not
a
word
in
the
opinion
about
prejudice.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
the
allegation
in
the
petition
for
mandamus
is
that
on
november
3,
1960,
petitioner
felt
that
the
respondent
court
has
motion
for
speedy
trial
which
motion
was
completely
ignored
by
the
respondent
--
the
county
prosecutor
and
for
over
a
period
of
six
years,
petitioner
has
attempt
to
gain
a
speedy
trial.
the
response
on
behalf
of
judge
hooey
to
the
petition
for
certiorari
was
that
by
latter
date
of
march
17,
1961,
petitioner
request
that
the
speedy
trial
and
reply
thereto
was
notified
that
he
would
be
afforded
the
trial
within
two
weeks
of
any
date,
petitioner
might
specify
which
he
could
be
present.
since
that
time
by
various
letters
and
more
formal
so-called
motions,
petitioner
has
asked
either
for
speedy
trial
or
dismissal
of
the
indictment.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
letters
and
more
formal
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
--
so-called
motions.
they're
described
by
the
respondent.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
well,
a
hearing
is
required
only
if
prejudice
is
an
element
of
the
sixth
amendment
claim.
i
am
perfectly
prepared
to
argue
that
it
is
not
and
that
we
do
not
want
to
entangle
speedy
trial
in
a
betts
versus
brady
type
of
role.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
oh,
i'm
prepared
to
concede
that
there
can
be,
yes.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
perhaps
i
misunderstood
mr.
moss'
argument.
i
certainly
agree
that
his
argument
is
as
you
said
that
it
was
justice
fortas,
but
i
understood
that
to
be
in
the
context
of
his
argument
about
indigency
that
if
smith
had
funds
and
did
not
make
him
self
available
that
then
he
had
waived.
now,
if
his
solvency
or
indigency
is
relevant,
then
i
quite
agree
that
there
could
have
been
a
waiver,
and
that
that
would
be
fact
issue.
i
submit
as
a
matter
of
law
that
a
solvency
has
never
whatever
to
do
with
it,
and
that
if
that
is
correct,
then,
there
is
no
possibility
of
a
finding
of
waiver
on
any
other
ground.
when
the
respondent
agrees
that
my
client
has
repeatedly
for
more
than
six
years
been
trying
to
assert
his
right
to
a
speedy
trial,
we
can
hardly
say
that
there
has
been
a
knowing
involuntary
relinquishment
of
known
right.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
no.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
it
would
mean
that
any
prisoner
whose
trial
had
been
delayed
so
long
that
it
can
be
said
that
it
is
no
longer
possible.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
think
that
that
something
that
can
be
decided
only
by
case
to
case
adjudication.
but
that
whatever
number
of
years
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
--
is
the
right
time
that
this
is
too
much.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
that
would
be
the
effect
if
you
held
as
i
submit
that
you
should
and
if
you
further
held
that
the
decision
was
fully
retroactive.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
not
so
far
as
i'm
advised.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
in
order
to
dismiss
the
indictment,
you
do,
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
oh,
yes,
apparently.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
think
it
is
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
well,
i
suppose
if
what
you
would
do
would
be
following
the
usual
practice
and
reverse
and
remand
for
further
action
not
inconsistent
with
your
opinion.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
well,
the
question
would
be
what
you
say
in
your
opinion,
and
therefore
what
action
by
the
texas
court
will
be
not
inconsistent.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
it
hadn't
occurred
to
me
if
it
was.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
well,
you
did
that
to
the
supreme
court
of
texas
in
the
case
of
hickman
versus
dean,
i
believe.
the
only
instance
i
know
of
them
which
this
court
is
issued
mandamus
to
a
state
court.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
oh,
this
court
does
that
all
the
time,
doesn't
it?
it
seems
to
me
that
is
precisely
what
you
do.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
oh,
that
i
think
is
a
question
in
the
first
instance
of
texas
law,
what
is
the
proper
remedy
here?
and
texas
law
state
ex
rel
moreau
v.
bond
regards
mandamus
from
the
supreme
court
as
the
proper
way
to
assert
a
right
to
a
speedy
trial
in
the
criminal
case.
it
is
a
rather
confusing
set
of
affairs,
but
that's
the
way
it
is
in
texas.
i
would
think
mr.
justice
brennan
in
response
to
your
question
that
what
this
court
would
do
if
it
agreed
with
both
my
brother
and
myself
on
the
underlying
issue.
at
a
minimum,
you
would
say
--
you
would
hold
that
the
texas
supreme
court
is
wrong
in
the
proposition
of
law
announced
in
cooper
and
at
lawrence,
that
the
mere
fact
the
person
is
in
federal
custody,
discharges
any
obligation
the
state
has.
but
this
would
be
the
minimum
you
would
do,
and
then
the
state
court
freed
from
the
compulsion
of
erroneous
view
of
federal
law
might
be
free
to
decide
for
itself
whether
or
not
it
wants
to
order
dismissal
or
whether
it
wants
to
leave
prejudice
still
in.
i
don't
think
that
is
all
that
this
court
has
the
power
to
do
or
appropriately
could
do
on
this
record.
i
think
that
the
question
of
the
proper
remedy
to
vindicate
the
right
to
a
speedy
trial
is
ultimately
a
federal
question
therefore,
one
in
which
this
court
can
speak
authoritatively.
and
i
think
that
whether
or
not
a
showing
of
prejudice
is
required
or
whether
or
not
untoward
delay
at
some
point
become
so
bad
as
simply
by
itself.
it
requires
dismissal
is
also
a
question
that
this
court
is
competent
to
decide.
but
anyone
of
those
things
which
still
in
form
be
a
reversal
in
my
submission
of
what
the
supreme
court
of
texas
did.
and
it
would
be
simply
be
a
question
of
how
much
guidance
this
court
chooses
to
give
texas
for
its
further
proceedings
not
inconsistent.
i
must
say
that
the
worse
possible
disposition
of
the
case,
and
i
have
to
submit
this
with
the
utmost
respect
would
be
to
say
that
in
the
light
of
the
very
commendable
statements
that
mr.
moss
hear
in
open
court
that
the
case
could
be
dismissed
without
opinion.
i
have
no
doubt
in
the
light
of
what
mr.
moss
has
told
us
that
thereafter
persons
in
this
situation
in
harris
county
would
be
given
a
speedy
trial.
mr.
moss
is
only
one
of
254
prosecutors
in
the
state
of
texas
alone,
and
as
he
quite
properly
said
he
cannot
bond
other
prosecutors.
he
cannot
bond
the
texas
courts.
indeed,
i
remind
you
with
some
poignancy
of
the
case
of
bush
v.
texas
decided
here
in
1963
in
which
this
court
in
effect
remanded
without
deciding
the
merits
of
the
issue
on
the
basis
of
a
representation
by
an
assistant
attorney
general
and
unfortunately,
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals
refused
to
agree
that
the
assistant
attorney
general
had
power
to
make
the
representation
and
bush
was
vindicated
only
after
long
and
elaborate
further
litigation.
i
think
we
have
here
a
constitutional
issue
that
is
not
going
to
go
away.
the
number
of
prisoners
so
situated
is
very
great
and
that
there
is
that
this
service
to
the
states,
if
the
issue
is
not
decided
on
seven
different
occasions.
i
have
myself
been
appointed
counsel
by
the
texas
supreme
court
in
cases
raising
the
precise
issue
with
the
hope
that
i
can
get
them
here
and
get
them
out
if
decided.
now,
this
time,
as
it
happened
the
prisoner,
got
the
case
here
on
his
own
and
viewpoint
of
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
no,
they
all
became
moot
before
i
could
get
a
petition
for
certiorari
to
you.
that's
the
way
that
these
things
unfortunately
often
go.
thank
you.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
submit
justice
fortas
that
the
guarantee
of
a
speedy
trial
is
not
limited
to
giving
you
at
a
trial
at
the
time
when
you
can
be
acquitted,
when
you
have
your
witnesses
that
it
protects
against
other
harms.
and
that
even
if
at
the
end
of
his
federal
term,
my
prisoner
were
to
be
turned
over
to
the
harris
county
authorities
and
we're
successfully
to
move
for
dismissal
because
of
denial
of
the
speedy
trial
that
he
would
have
been
adversely
affected
by
the
pendency
of
this
charge
because
i
don't
--
that's
all
it
is
inside
charge
against
him
during
the
time
that
he's
been
in
the
federal
penitentiary.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
perhaps
it
would.
if
he
were
to
do
so
without
more,
i
think
it
will
be
a
surprising
action
on
the
part
of
the
respondent
judge
when
the
law
in
texas
authoritatively
declared
twice
in
the
last
two
years,
is
that
federal
imprisonment
is
an
adequate
excuse
for
not
giving
the
speedy
trial.
it
would
--
it
think
and
not
be
a
--
it
would
be
a
lawless
act
really
if
a
texas
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
well,
there
might
be
other
grounds,
yes.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yeah,
it
has
been
suggested,
i'm
not
personally
cognizant
of
what
there
might
be.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
you
wouldn't
have
it
determined
in
this
case
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
it
would
be
right
back
in
some
other
case
to
plague
you.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
that
would
be
precisely
my
submission
mr.
chief
justice.
i
would
not
urge
this
court
to
decide
a
constitutional
issue
prematurely,
but
at
the
same
time,
i
do
not
think
that
court
can
shrink
from
the
responsibility
of
deciding
constitutional
issues
when
they
have
been
properly
put
before
the
court.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
in
my
submission
if
would
be,
yes.
all
that
we
think,
the
obligation
of
the
state
is
to
make
a
reasonable
effort
to
get
the
prisoner.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
here
is
whether
or
not
a
state
is
excuse
from
the
duty
that
would
otherwise
be
upon
it
to
give
a
speedy
trial
to
a
person
it
has
indicted
on
the
state
charge
because
that
person
is
during
pendency
of
the
indictment
in
the
federal
penitentiary
on
some
other
charge.
the
texas
supreme
court
in
a
consistent
line
of
cases
has
ruled
that
it
is
not
that
although
it
is
bound
to
give
a
speedy
charge
to
a
person
under
texas
indictment
who
was
under
--
who
was
in
a
texas
prison
that
it
is
not
required
as
some
other
sovereign
to
produce
a
prisoner
in
order
that
may
try
him.
i
propose
to
spend
unless
the
court
has
its
questions
on
the
matter
very
little
time
on
the
merits
in
part
because
i
do
not
think
that
there
is
an
issue
as
between
my
friends
for
the
state
and
myself
on
the
underlying
constitutional
principle.
i
do
not
find
such
an
issue
drawn
in
the
brief
and
i
believe
that
mr.
moss
speaks
for
the
respondent
that
it
will
appear
that
we
agree
on
the
basic
constitutional
point.
now,
of
course
the
agreement
of
counsel
can't
put
an
authoritative
construction
on
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
but
i
would
think
that
on
the
substantive
point,
your
decision
last
term
speaking
through
justice
marshall
in
the
case
of
page
versus
barber
is
quite
decisive
that
the
problem
decided
in
page
and
barber
is
really
indistinguishable
from
the
problem
of
this
case
presents
that
where
someone
who
is
needed
for
a
criminal
proceeding
is
in
the
custody
of
some
other
sovereign
that
at
least
the
state
has
the
duty
to
make
a
reasonable
effort
to
endeavor
to
getting
back
from
the
prison
in
which
he
presently
languishes.
a
reasonable
effort
is
all
that
page
and
barber
requires
to
solve
that
we
contend
for
us
the
rule
in
this
case
since
it
is
i
think
quite
clear
here
that
texas
has
made
no
effort
to
get
this
petitioner
back
from
leavenworth.
i
do
want
to
call
to
the
court's
attention
a
study
of
this
matter
that
it
is
not
referred
to
an
either
of
the
briefs
because
it
has
become
available
only
very
recently
and
that
is
a
63-page
national
survey
of
detainers
prepared
by
the
national
defender
project
of
the
national
legal
aid
and
defender
association.
that
association
made
copies
available
both
to
counsel
for
the
respondent
and
to
myself
and
i'm
sure
would
be
glad
to
make
copies
of
their
very
comprehensive
survey
available
to
the
court.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i'm
sure
that
they
can
be
made
available
and
i
will
see
that
that
happens
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
there
is
an
issue
between
my
friends
and
myself.
i'm
not
sure
whether
it
goes
to
substance
or
to
procedure
that
has
to
do
with
the
effect
of
the
solvency
of
a
person
under
the
state
charges.
the
state
makes
the
argument
that
they
do
not
know
when
the
present
petitioner
became
indigent
and
that
since
the
indictment
that
they
returned
against
him
in
1960
alleged
that
he
had
recently
acquired
by
theft
some
$42,000.00
unless
he
notified
them
that
he
were
indigent,
they
would
have
no
reason
to
know
that
he
was
indigent.
and
therefore,
no
reason
to
think
that
he
could
not
finance
his
own
way
to
houston
in
order
to
stand
trial.
the
--
in
the
view
that
petitioner
submits
of
that
the
fact
is
of
his
indigency
is
irrelevant
that
the
obligation
to
give
a
speedy
trial
extends
as
well
to
a
prisoner
or
in
person
under
indictment
who
is
rich
as
it
does
to
one
who
is
without
funds.
it's
a
little
hard
to
see,
in
fact,
what
good
it
would
have
done
the
petitioner
if
he
had
had
funds
the
states
says,
“well,
we
would've
given
him
a
trial
within
two
weeks
anytime
he
showed
up
in
houston.”
and
if
he'd
the
money
to
pay
his
way
from
leavenworth
to
houston
and
it
said
to
himself,
“oh,
i
think
i
would
go
down
to
houston
and
stand
trial.”
i
imagine
that
the
federal
prison
authorities
at
leavenworth
would've
taken
a
rather
deem
view
of
that.
that
they
would
not
have
allowed
him
to
go
unless
the
state
had
made
an
effort,
we're
told
in
memorandum
of
the
solicitor
general.
but
ordinarily,
the
policy
of
the
bureau
of
prisons
is
to
require
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
at
prosequendum
from
the
state
court
and
that
when
that
comes,
the
bureau
then
is
very
cooperative
and
almost
invariably
will
make
the
prisoner
available.
but
it
isn't
the
fact
that
mr.
smith
did
or
did
not
have
funds
that
in
my
submission
is
significant.
it
is
the
fact
the
he
was
confined
by
the
federal
authorities
and
that
some
request
from
the
state
authorities
was
necessary
before
the
federal
authorities
would
let
him
out
of
the
walls
of
leavenworth
to
go
to
houston
to
stand
trial.
there
are
obvious
problems
in
this
case
because
the
record
is
not
very
frequent.
i'm
very
aware
of
that
from
the
outset
of
the
case
and
the
state
suggest
in
its
brief
because
of
the
skimpiness
of
the
record
it
--
this
court
either
should
dismiss
the
writ
as
improvidently
granted
or
should
remand
the
case
to
the
--
either
the
texas
supreme
court
or
state
trial
court
for
further
fact
findings.
i
submit
however
that
the
record
skimpy
as
it
is
presents
every
fact
that
is
necessary
for
decision
of
the
comparatively
narrow
issue
that
the
case
presents
that
it
would
be
nice
to
have
a
good
deal
of
background
to
this
day,
though
i'm
his
counsel
do
not
know
on
what
federal
offense
my
client
was
convicted
but
i
can't
think
it
really
makes
any
difference
whether
he
was
in
leavenworth
on
one
crime
or
another
that
these
are
matters
of
color
only.
and
that
the
basic
legal
facts
are
perfectly
clear
in
the
record
that
he
was
indicted
in
april
of
1960
in
harris
county
for
a
crime
allegedly
committed
in
may
of
1959
that
as
of
that
time
he
was
a
federal
prisoner
that
the
sheriff
of
harris
county
wrote
to
leavenworth
and
was
advised
that
he
would
not
be
released
until
1970.
the
beginning
at
least
in
march
of
1961,
the
petitioner
has
made
repeated
request
to
have
a
speedy
trial
that
he
has
not
been
brought
on
for
trial
at
any
time
that
there
has
now
a
lapse
some
eight
years
and
that
the
time
is
long
since
past
when
it
is
possible
to
give
the
petitioner
the
kind
of
trial
to
which
he's
constitutionally
entitled.
so
that
in
our
submission,
the
writ
was
providently
granted
and
the
record
is
ample
to
decide
the
matter
that
is
before
you.
the
record
in
addition
to
being
skimpy
is
somewhat
informal.
the
petitioner
addressed
his
writ
of
mandamus
in
the
state
court
to
a
non-existent
court,
the
texas
criminal
court
of
appeals
and
it
was
transferred
by
that
court
informally
to
the
texas
supreme
court
as
the
texas
supreme
court
has
jurisdiction
in
these
matters.
the
texas
supreme
court
entered
no
formal
order
instead
the
administrative
assistant
to
the
court
wrote
to
the
petitioners
saying
that
the,
“your
petitioners
today
have
been
denied”
referring
to
the
cooper
case
and
the
lawrence
case
as
authority
for
the
denial.”
but
the
mere
fact
of
informality
in
the
state
court
proceedings
does
not
mean
that
we
have
any
less
a
final
judgment
of
the
highest
court
of
the
state
in
which
decision
can
be
had.
i
refer
and
hold
the
case
of
in
re
summers
for
example
in
325
f.2d
in
which
was
a
letter
from
the
chief
justice.
that
the
secretary
of
the
illinois
bar
committee
that
was
the
definitive
action
of
the
illinois
court
and
this
court
held
nonetheless
that
it
had
--
that
that
letter
was
a
sufficient
--
were
definitive
act
to
permit
review
under
section
1257.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
the
record
certainly
shows
that.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
that's
--
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge,
it's
correct,
justice
stewart.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
would
read
it
somewhat
different
with
respect
your
honor
it
seems
to
me
that
what
general
griswold
has
said
there
is
that
occasionally
this
has
happen
to
the
instance
of
the
prisoner.
but
that
a
prisoner
not
later
than
law
can
hardly
be
expected
to
know
that
this
procedure
was
available.
he
was
doing
but
to
him
where
the
obvious
things.
he
was
beseeching
the
harris
county
authorities
with
motions
and
letters
of
various
cons
as
been
told
in
the
response.
that
under
the
published
rules
of
the
board
of
prisons,
the
prisoner
is
not
advised
that,
“if
you'll
ask
us
we
will
come
to
your
assistance.”
instead
the
rules
speak
only
that
a
prisoner
will
ordinary
be
made
available
if
the
state
authorities
requested.
and
i
think
that
it
would
be
asking
a
good
deal
to
say
that
the
petitioner
has
waived
any
right
he
had
because
he
did
not
pursue
a
remedy
that
even
a
reasonably
observant
person
would
not
have
known
existed.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
there
is
“not”
omitted
there.
you
will
see
that
the
“not”
appears
at
page
25
of
our
brief
where
we
have
quoted
it
but
here
in
the
appendix,
it
was
omitted
unfortunately
under
the
procedure
in
indigence
cases
counsel
do
not
get
to
proofread
the
briefs.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
that
is
what
i
should
say,
yes,
it's
what
the
original
file
says.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
do
not
--
do
not
gather
that
though
i
don't
think
that
what
is
said
here
is
definitive
one
way
or
the
other.
i
--
as
i
read
this,
what
the
solicitor
general
griswold
is
saying
is
that
occasionally
if
the
prisoner
asked
us,
we'll
write
to
the
local
prosecutor
and
say,
“if
you
ask
for
writ
of
habeas
--
if
you
get
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
at
prosequendum
in
your
state
court,
then
we'll
make
this
prisoner
available
so
that
you
may
try
him.”
i
do
not
think
it
is
saying
at
all
that
the
united
states
is
acting
simply
on
the
request
to
the
prisoner
whether
the
prisoner
at
--
in
harris
county
and
say,
“one
state
authority,
here
he
is,
go
ahead.”
mr.
charles
alan
wright
then
the
practice
is
that
the
writ
ordinary
would
be
honored
the
state
is
required
to
pay
the
expenses
of
transporting
him
and
guards
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
gather
its
one
thing
they're
not
interested
in
doing,
yes.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
it
says
in
some
instances
to
mitigate
because
of
the
state,
the
bureau
of
prison
has
removed
an
inmate
to
a
facility
close
to
the
site
of
prosecution.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
well,
there
is
a
statutory
procedure
for
it
section
4085
and
there
are
also
rules
of
the
board
of
prisons
that
are
issued
from
time
to
time.
a
bulletin
that
comes
out
now
and
again
that
is
made
available
to
state
authorities
who
inquire
telling
exactly
what
the
procedure
is.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes.
thank
you,
your
honors.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
i
should
speak
immediately
of
the
question
of
what
the
relief
is
that
has
been
asked
since
there
is
apparently
some
concern
about
that.
the
only
relief
that
petitioner
asked
for,
for
the
texas
court
was
that
the
indictment
against
him
be
dismissed.
that
is
all
that
is
before
you
in
this
proceeding.
i
call
your
attention
to
the
final
paragraph
of
the
petition
for
mandamus,
reprinted
at
page
4
of
the
brown
appendix.
now
at
prior
time
since
march
17,
1961
according
to
the
record,
he
has
asked
variously
either
for
trial
or
for
dismissal,
but
the
present
proceeding
is
a
request
for
dismissal
only.
that
of
course
does
not
foreclose
what
this
court
may
do.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes,
surely.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
that
is
the
case
of
lawrence
v.
texas.
the
opinion
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
that
is
not
this
case,
no.
the
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
the
letter
from
the
administrative
assistant
of
the
court
said
we
cite
you
the
cooper
v.
state
and
the
lawrence
v.
state,
we
are
enclosing
a
copy
of
the
per
curium
opinion
in
the
latter
case.
in
fact,
i
think
--
as
a
matter
of
personal
privilege,
i
will
say
that
i
did
not
include
the
lawrence
opinion
as
a
part
of
the
appendix
to
be
printed
but
somehow
it
showed
up
in
the
printed
appendix.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
it
was
an
enclosure
with
the
letter,
yes
and
i
submit
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
that
is
correct
justice
brennan.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
petitioner
asked
that.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
that
is
correct,
except
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
think
not.
i
think
that's
what
klopfer
held.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
think
klopfer
v.
north
carolina,
there
is
not
a
word
in
the
opinion
about
prejudice.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
the
allegation
in
the
petition
for
mandamus
is
that
on
november
3,
1960,
petitioner
felt
that
the
respondent
court
has
motion
for
speedy
trial
which
motion
was
completely
ignored
by
the
respondent
--
the
county
prosecutor
and
for
over
a
period
of
six
years,
petitioner
has
attempt
to
gain
a
speedy
trial.
the
response
on
behalf
of
judge
hooey
to
the
petition
for
certiorari
was
that
by
latter
date
of
march
17,
1961,
petitioner
request
that
the
speedy
trial
and
reply
thereto
was
notified
that
he
would
be
afforded
the
trial
within
two
weeks
of
any
date,
petitioner
might
specify
which
he
could
be
present.
since
that
time
by
various
letters
and
more
formal
so-called
motions,
petitioner
has
asked
either
for
speedy
trial
or
dismissal
of
the
indictment.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
letters
and
more
formal
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
--
so-called
motions.
they're
described
by
the
respondent.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
well,
a
hearing
is
required
only
if
prejudice
is
an
element
of
the
sixth
amendment
claim.
i
am
perfectly
prepared
to
argue
that
it
is
not
and
that
we
do
not
want
to
entangle
speedy
trial
in
a
betts
versus
brady
type
of
role.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
oh,
i'm
prepared
to
concede
that
there
can
be,
yes.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
perhaps
i
misunderstood
mr.
moss'
argument.
i
certainly
agree
that
his
argument
is
as
you
said
that
it
was
justice
fortas,
but
i
understood
that
to
be
in
the
context
of
his
argument
about
indigency
that
if
smith
had
funds
and
did
not
make
him
self
available
that
then
he
had
waived.
now,
if
his
solvency
or
indigency
is
relevant,
then
i
quite
agree
that
there
could
have
been
a
waiver,
and
that
that
would
be
fact
issue.
i
submit
as
a
matter
of
law
that
a
solvency
has
never
whatever
to
do
with
it,
and
that
if
that
is
correct,
then,
there
is
no
possibility
of
a
finding
of
waiver
on
any
other
ground.
when
the
respondent
agrees
that
my
client
has
repeatedly
for
more
than
six
years
been
trying
to
assert
his
right
to
a
speedy
trial,
we
can
hardly
say
that
there
has
been
a
knowing
involuntary
relinquishment
of
known
right.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
no.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
it
would
mean
that
any
prisoner
whose
trial
had
been
delayed
so
long
that
it
can
be
said
that
it
is
no
longer
possible.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
think
that
that
something
that
can
be
decided
only
by
case
to
case
adjudication.
but
that
whatever
number
of
years
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
--
is
the
right
time
that
this
is
too
much.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
that
would
be
the
effect
if
you
held
as
i
submit
that
you
should
and
if
you
further
held
that
the
decision
was
fully
retroactive.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
not
so
far
as
i'm
advised.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
in
order
to
dismiss
the
indictment,
you
do,
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
oh,
yes,
apparently.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
think
it
is
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
well,
i
suppose
if
what
you
would
do
would
be
following
the
usual
practice
and
reverse
and
remand
for
further
action
not
inconsistent
with
your
opinion.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
well,
the
question
would
be
what
you
say
in
your
opinion,
and
therefore
what
action
by
the
texas
court
will
be
not
inconsistent.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
it
hadn't
occurred
to
me
if
it
was.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
well,
you
did
that
to
the
supreme
court
of
texas
in
the
case
of
hickman
versus
dean,
i
believe.
the
only
instance
i
know
of
them
which
this
court
is
issued
mandamus
to
a
state
court.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
oh,
this
court
does
that
all
the
time,
doesn't
it?
it
seems
to
me
that
is
precisely
what
you
do.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
oh,
that
i
think
is
a
question
in
the
first
instance
of
texas
law,
what
is
the
proper
remedy
here?
and
texas
law
state
ex
rel
moreau
v.
bond
regards
mandamus
from
the
supreme
court
as
the
proper
way
to
assert
a
right
to
a
speedy
trial
in
the
criminal
case.
it
is
a
rather
confusing
set
of
affairs,
but
that's
the
way
it
is
in
texas.
i
would
think
mr.
justice
brennan
in
response
to
your
question
that
what
this
court
would
do
if
it
agreed
with
both
my
brother
and
myself
on
the
underlying
issue.
at
a
minimum,
you
would
say
--
you
would
hold
that
the
texas
supreme
court
is
wrong
in
the
proposition
of
law
announced
in
cooper
and
at
lawrence,
that
the
mere
fact
the
person
is
in
federal
custody,
discharges
any
obligation
the
state
has.
but
this
would
be
the
minimum
you
would
do,
and
then
the
state
court
freed
from
the
compulsion
of
erroneous
view
of
federal
law
might
be
free
to
decide
for
itself
whether
or
not
it
wants
to
order
dismissal
or
whether
it
wants
to
leave
prejudice
still
in.
i
don't
think
that
is
all
that
this
court
has
the
power
to
do
or
appropriately
could
do
on
this
record.
i
think
that
the
question
of
the
proper
remedy
to
vindicate
the
right
to
a
speedy
trial
is
ultimately
a
federal
question
therefore,
one
in
which
this
court
can
speak
authoritatively.
and
i
think
that
whether
or
not
a
showing
of
prejudice
is
required
or
whether
or
not
untoward
delay
at
some
point
become
so
bad
as
simply
by
itself.
it
requires
dismissal
is
also
a
question
that
this
court
is
competent
to
decide.
but
anyone
of
those
things
which
still
in
form
be
a
reversal
in
my
submission
of
what
the
supreme
court
of
texas
did.
and
it
would
be
simply
be
a
question
of
how
much
guidance
this
court
chooses
to
give
texas
for
its
further
proceedings
not
inconsistent.
i
must
say
that
the
worse
possible
disposition
of
the
case,
and
i
have
to
submit
this
with
the
utmost
respect
would
be
to
say
that
in
the
light
of
the
very
commendable
statements
that
mr.
moss
hear
in
open
court
that
the
case
could
be
dismissed
without
opinion.
i
have
no
doubt
in
the
light
of
what
mr.
moss
has
told
us
that
thereafter
persons
in
this
situation
in
harris
county
would
be
given
a
speedy
trial.
mr.
moss
is
only
one
of
254
prosecutors
in
the
state
of
texas
alone,
and
as
he
quite
properly
said
he
cannot
bond
other
prosecutors.
he
cannot
bond
the
texas
courts.
indeed,
i
remind
you
with
some
poignancy
of
the
case
of
bush
v.
texas
decided
here
in
1963
in
which
this
court
in
effect
remanded
without
deciding
the
merits
of
the
issue
on
the
basis
of
a
representation
by
an
assistant
attorney
general
and
unfortunately,
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals
refused
to
agree
that
the
assistant
attorney
general
had
power
to
make
the
representation
and
bush
was
vindicated
only
after
long
and
elaborate
further
litigation.
i
think
we
have
here
a
constitutional
issue
that
is
not
going
to
go
away.
the
number
of
prisoners
so
situated
is
very
great
and
that
there
is
that
this
service
to
the
states,
if
the
issue
is
not
decided
on
seven
different
occasions.
i
have
myself
been
appointed
counsel
by
the
texas
supreme
court
in
cases
raising
the
precise
issue
with
the
hope
that
i
can
get
them
here
and
get
them
out
if
decided.
now,
this
time,
as
it
happened
the
prisoner,
got
the
case
here
on
his
own
and
viewpoint
of
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
no,
they
all
became
moot
before
i
could
get
a
petition
for
certiorari
to
you.
that's
the
way
that
these
things
unfortunately
often
go.
thank
you.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
submit
justice
fortas
that
the
guarantee
of
a
speedy
trial
is
not
limited
to
giving
you
at
a
trial
at
the
time
when
you
can
be
acquitted,
when
you
have
your
witnesses
that
it
protects
against
other
harms.
and
that
even
if
at
the
end
of
his
federal
term,
my
prisoner
were
to
be
turned
over
to
the
harris
county
authorities
and
we're
successfully
to
move
for
dismissal
because
of
denial
of
the
speedy
trial
that
he
would
have
been
adversely
affected
by
the
pendency
of
this
charge
because
i
don't
--
that's
all
it
is
inside
charge
against
him
during
the
time
that
he's
been
in
the
federal
penitentiary.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
perhaps
it
would.
if
he
were
to
do
so
without
more,
i
think
it
will
be
a
surprising
action
on
the
part
of
the
respondent
judge
when
the
law
in
texas
authoritatively
declared
twice
in
the
last
two
years,
is
that
federal
imprisonment
is
an
adequate
excuse
for
not
giving
the
speedy
trial.
it
would
--
it
think
and
not
be
a
--
it
would
be
a
lawless
act
really
if
a
texas
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
well,
there
might
be
other
grounds,
yes.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yeah,
it
has
been
suggested,
i'm
not
personally
cognizant
of
what
there
might
be.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
you
wouldn't
have
it
determined
in
this
case
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
it
would
be
right
back
in
some
other
case
to
plague
you.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
that
would
be
precisely
my
submission
mr.
chief
justice.
i
would
not
urge
this
court
to
decide
a
constitutional
issue
prematurely,
but
at
the
same
time,
i
do
not
think
that
court
can
shrink
from
the
responsibility
of
deciding
constitutional
issues
when
they
have
been
properly
put
before
the
court.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
in
my
submission
if
would
be,
yes.
all
that
we
think,
the
obligation
of
the
state
is
to
make
a
reasonable
effort
to
get
the
prisoner.
