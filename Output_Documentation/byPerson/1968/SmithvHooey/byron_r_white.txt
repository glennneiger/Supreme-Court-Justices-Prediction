justice
byron
r.
white
what
was
the
--
as
the
--
do
the
federal
authorities
mean
to
indicate
that
if
the
prisoner
himself
requested
they
not
only
would
make
him
available
but
make
him
available
at
their
expense?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
such
a
writ
is
issued
the
instance
of
the
state
authorities,
what
happens
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
this
is
precisely
what
texas
is
not
interested
in
doing
i
gather
the
one
thing.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
was
the
writ
--
what
was
the
action
of
law
--
in
the
--
this
was
a
petition
for
writ
of
mandamus?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
want
to
--
and
if
you
want
to
expedite
a
rich
prisoner
from
new
york
(voice
overlap),
then
you
pay
his
expenses?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
if
he's
got
$42,000.00.
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
what
i
thought.
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
i
take
that
his
petition
for
mandamus
in
the
court
below
in
the
texas
supreme
court
asked
in
the
alternative
for
a
trial
for
a
prompt
trial
or
dismissal
of
the
indictment.
justice
byron
r.
white
made
no
allegations
that
as
of
that
time,
he
had
never
been
denied
his
speech?
justice
byron
r.
white
except
for
the
bill?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
will
pay
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
--
i
suppose
his
first
offense
would
be
that
he's
been
denied
a
speedy
trial.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
there's
no
issue
have
left
here
for
adjudication.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
of
--
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
if
we
just
--
based
on
your
representation
here
in
open
court,
we
just
remanded
the
case
for
further
proceedings.
justice
byron
r.
white
without
any
opinion
or
anything
else.
i
mean
without
an
adjudication
of
the
constitutional
it
should
be.
justice
byron
r.
white
then
what
would
you
do?
justice
byron
r.
white
dismiss
on
the
grounds
of
the
delay?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
in
any
event,
you're
going
to
get
to
the
trial,
you've
given
him
one
of
the
prayers,
one
of
the
alternative
prayers
of
his
petition
in
the
state
court.
he
wanted
either
a
trial
or
dismissal?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
--
professor
wright,
as
long
as
in
texas
we're
still
refusing
to
try
a
man
and
said
we're
not
going
to
try
him
as
long
as
he's
in
custody,
there
might
be
some
pretty
solid
basis
for
saying
that
he
is
being
denied
his
speedy
--
his
right
to
a
speedy
trial.
but
if
texas
is
now
willing
to
try
him
in
order
to
dismiss
the
indictment,
you
have
to
conclude
that
as
of
this
date,
he's
been
denied
a
speedy
trial,
would
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
your
argument
apparently
is
that
the
--
you
just
don't
need
any
facts,
seven
years
is
just
long
enough
in
anybody's
book?
justice
byron

what
