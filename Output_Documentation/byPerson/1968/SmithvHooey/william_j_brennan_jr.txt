justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
moss,
may
i
ask,
i'm
looking
at
the
prayer
of
--
at
which
you
close
your
brief
and
says
that,
since
the
record
is
insufficient
to
permit
decision
that
we
should
do
one
of
three
things
as
i
read
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
dismiss
the
writ
of
certiorari
and
probably
be
granted,
hold
it
to
all
relief
prayed
for
the
petitioner
to
be
denied.
it's
the
third
one
that
interests
me,
or
that
the
cause
be
remanded
to
the
supreme
court
of
texas
for
proceedings
therein
or
in
the
state
trial
court
for
the
development
of
the
facts.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
what
are
the
facts
that
we
should
be
develop?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
mean,
if
we're
going
to
bring
him
in
for
that
kind
of
hearing
and
as
mr.
justice
white
pointed
out
his
petition
was
either
for
a
trial
or
for
dismissal
of
the
indictment,
why
not
send
them
back
to
you
and
let
it
be
brought
there
for
the
trial
on
the
new
merits?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
just
so
i'm
clear.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
what
we're
talking
about
then
is
what
appears
at
page
4,
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
there
you
did
ask
dismissal
of
the
charge,
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
just
a
technical
point,
professor
wright?
and
this
was
a
writ
of
mandamus.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
suppose
we
agreed
with
you,
what
does
the
reversal
mean?
do
we
order
the
supreme
court
of
texas
to
issue
that
a
writ
of
mandamus
that
he
tried
to?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
teach
him,
would
it
do
any
good?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
the
(inaudible)
i
wonder
if
this
is
2283
problem?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
--
well,
most
likely.
the
court
of
the
united
states,
that
includes
this
court
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
not
grant
an
injunction
to
state
proceedings
in
the
state
court
for
certain
sentences.
what's
the
effect
of
our
ordering
the
supreme
court
of
texas
to
grant
a
writ
of
mandamus
to
a
trial
judge?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
nevertheless,
you
are
and
would
be
in
effect
ordering
simple
proceeding
not
to
go
forward?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
you
do
unless
you
do
a
criminal
case.
