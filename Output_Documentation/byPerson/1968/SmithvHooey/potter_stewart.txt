i
read
the
response
of
this
case
from
the
solicitor
general
appearing
on
pages
32
and
33
of
your
brief.
he
indicates
that
if
the
prisoner
himself
if
somebody
situated
as
is
your
client
himself
requested
the
bureau
of
prisons
will
arrange
to
make
him
available
for
a

trial.

a
full
paragraph
in
the
middle
of
page
33
and
he
further
says
that
the
petitioner
did
not
request
any
assistance
from
the
united
states
bureau
of

justice

is
that
all
correct?

have
one

question
about

the
final
sentence
of

oh,
we
