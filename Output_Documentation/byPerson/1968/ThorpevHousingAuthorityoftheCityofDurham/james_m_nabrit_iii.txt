mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
for
the
second
time
to
review
a
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
north
carolina
affirming
an
order
that
petitioner
and
her
four
children
be
evicted
from
a
low-income
public
housing
project
in
durham,
north
carolina.
the
question
for
decision
is
whether
tenants
in
federally
financed
projects,
operated
under
the
united
states
housing
act
of
1937
as
amended,
may
be
evicted
from
their
homes
and
their
federal
benefits
terminated
without
being
told
any
reason
or
given
any
opportunity
to
be
heard
in
their
own
defense
before
the
decision
to
evict
is
made
by
the
housing
authorities.
now,
let
me
emphasize
at
the
outset
that,
in
our
view,
the
fundamental
underlying
question
here
is
whether
poor
people
who
depend
on
the
government
for
the
necessities
of
life,
for
shelter,
whether
poor
people
will
get
the
same
kind
of
procedural
rights
and
protections
that
our
citizen
--
that
our
system
has
long
given
to
more
fortunate
citizens
and
their
contacts
with
government
administrators.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
no,
your
honor.
i
wouldn't
contend
that.
i
said
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
i
said
more
fortunate
citizens
and
their
contacts
with
the
government.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
it's
our
position,
may
it
please
the
court,
that
it's
a
common
place
of
administrative
law
when,
in
all
sorts
of
situations,
when
a
professional
man's
license
is
threatened
to
with
revocation,
when
a
security,
as
in
the
goldsmith
case
or
in
the
willner
case
last
year,
if
--
to
get
a
notice
in
a
hearing,
it
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
well,
the
thing
that
i
--
the
difference
i
perceive
is
the
difference
in
the
purpose
of
the
program
because
the
purpose
of
this
program
under
the
housing
act
is
to
provide
housing
for
poor
people.
it's
a
government
benefit
program.
so
that,
to
the
extent
that
there's
--
that
there
are
differences
between
government
benefit
programs
and
incidental
programs
to
the
management
of
connected
with
inc
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
programs
could
--
incidental
to
the
management
of
government
buildings.
you
may
have
different
principles
to
apply.
so,
my
argument
is
not
addressed
to
that,
mr.
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
well,
i
agree
that
these
issues
about
the
rights
of
the
poor
are
a
challenge
to
us
all,
but
there
are
none
without
difficulties.
let's
look
at
the
position
of
the
housing
authority
in
this
case.
they
claim,
after
all
that's
transpired,
after
three
years
of
this
litigation,
they
still
maintain
that
they
don't
even
have
to
have
a
reason,
they
don't
have
to
have
any
cause
to
evict
a
low-income
family
from
its
home.
they
claim
that
they
have
no
duty
to
tell
the
town
anything
or
listen
to
anything
that
the
tenant
has
to
say.
their
position
is,
in
some,
is
that
these
destitute
people
who
pend
on
--
who
depend
on
the
government
for
shelter
don't
have
any
rights,
that
the
auth
--
procedural
rights
that
authority
is
bound
to
respect.
say
i
think
it
is
relevant.
the
point
is
not
lost
on
poor
people
and
that
they
do
understand
what's
going
on
when
the
legal
system
treats
them
this
way.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
now,
let's
look
at
the
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
think
i
agree
with
that.
i
don't
contend
that
there's
a
major
equal
protection
component
to
the
case.
i
think
it's
a
problem.
of
the
principal
problem
in
the
case
is
what
sort
of
procedures
due
process
requires.
when
the
government
is
landlord,
it
deals
with
people.
i
don't
disagree
with
that
at
all.
let's
begin
with
a
few
words
about
this
federal
law,
the
housing
act
of
1937,
so
that
we
have
a
statutory
frame
of
reference
for
the
consti
--
to
discuss
the
constitutional
questions.
the
congress
has
declared
that
the
policy
of
using
federal
funds
and
credit
to
remedy
the
unsafe
and
unsanitary
housing
conditions
and
their
acute
shortage
of
decent,
safe,
and
sanitary
dwellings
for
families
of
low-income.
now,
housing
in
this
particular
program
is
provided
only
for
families
“who
are
in
the
lowest
income
group
and
cannot
afford
to
pay
enough
to
cause
private
enterprise
to
build
an
adequate
supply
of
decent,
safe,
and
sanitary
dwellings
for
their
use.
now,
the
subsidies
in
this
program,
although
it's
operated
by
local
housing
authorities,
the
subsidies
are
almost
entirely
100%
federal.
the
permanent
financing
of
these
projects
is
done
by
bonds
sold
by
the
local
authorities.
and
if
the
federal
law
subsidizes
these
bonds
in
several
ways.
first,
they
make
the
interest
n
the
bonds
federally
tax-exempt
which
has
the
effect
of
lowering
the
interest
rate.
then,
the
government
of
the
united
states
places
its
credit,
the
credit
of
the
united
states,
to
assure
the
payment
of
the
bonds
and
under
an
annual
contributions
contract
with
the
local
authorities,
the
united
states
agrees
to
pay
up
to
100%
on
the
debt
service
on
the
bonds.
the
local
authorities
apply
their
net
receipts
to
the
payment
of
the
debt
service
and
any
difference
the
united
states
makes
up.
with
some
projects,
the
united
states
does
pay
100%
of
the
debt
service.
in
addition,
the
united
states
makes
ca
--
additional
cash
contributions
for
elderly
families
and
on
account
on
displaced
families,
families
displaced
by
federal
projects
and,
finally,
the
united
states
pays
the
administrative
cost
of
the
housing
assistance
administration,
a
part
of
haa
itself.
now,
the
state
and
local
governments,
rather
than
subsidizing
the
projects,
in
some
case
actually
gain
revenue
from
there
by
receiving
payments
in
lieu
of
local
real
estate
taxes
from
these
housing
authorities
which,
under
the
statute,
may
amount
to
up
to
10%
of
the
rental
income
of
the
projects.
there
are
now
2.6
million
people
in
the
united
states
living
in
these
federally
assisted
projects.
perhaps
a
quarter
of
a
million
of
them
have
moved
in
these
projects
since
this
case
was
last
argued
here
a
year-and-a
half
ago.
the
program
is
rapidly
expanding.
about
half
of
these
people
are
black,
about
a
third
of
them
are
elderly,
their
medium-family
income
is
little
over
$2,700,
and
the
average
rent
they
pay
is
about
$50
and
those
figures
are
for
1967.
of
the
petitioner
was
found
eligible
as
she
moved
into
her
apartment
at
$29
a
month
in
november
of
1964.
her
lease
gave
--
her
lease
was
a
month-to-month
tenancy.
it
gave
both
the
tenant
and
the
authority
the
right
to
terminate
by
giving
15
days
notice
before
the
end
of
any
month,
and
she
lived
in
the
project
without
any
incident
for
8-9
months.
in
august
--
on
august
10,
to
be
precise,
of
1965,
mrs.
thorpe
was
elected
president
of
a
tenant's
organization
that
was
being
organized
in
the
project.
and,
the
very
next
day,
the
authority
sent
her
a
notice
that
her
lease
was
terminated
at
the
end
of
that
month.
several
times
she
asked
for
a
hearing,
she
was
told
only
that
the
authority
was
not
required
to
give
a
reason
for
--
or
a
hearing.
and,
when
she
did
not
move
out,
this
present
suit
for
summary
eviction
was
brought
in
the
state
courts
which
ordered
her
eviction.
the
state
supreme
court
ruled
on
the
first
appeal
that
the
lease
was
terminated
the
ter
--
because
the
term
had
expired
that
the
auth
--
that
the
reason
the
authority
terminated
was
immaterial
and
this
court
granted
review
during
the
october
term
1966.
after
argument
here
in
this
court,
a
year-and-a
half
ago,
the
case
was
remanded
to
the
court
below
to
reconsider
it
in
view
of
a
supervening
event
in
administrative
direction
directive
circular
issued
by
the
department
of
housing
and
urban
development,
which
directed
that
tenants
not
be
given
notices
to
vacate
without
being
told
the
reasons
and
an
opportunity
to
reply
or
explain.
on
remand,
the
court
below
again
affirmed
stating
that
its
prior
judgme
--
its
prior
opinion
stood.
it
stood
by
it
and
ruling
that
the
circular
was
inapplicable
because
issued
after
the
lease,
the
termination
notice,
and
the
court
orders.
so,
mrs.
thorpe
remains
in
her
apartment
under
stay
orders
issued
throughout
these
appeals.
now
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
authority
is
created
under
a
north
carolina
statute
called
the
north
carolina
housing
authorities
law.
it's
general
statutes
of
north
carolina
section
157.1.
the
--
it's
the
--
well,
actually,
section
157.4
describes
in
some
detail
the
process.
petition
there
could
be
filed
by
petition
by
taxpayers.
they
have
to
have
hearings
to
determine
whether
or
not
there's
a
housing
shortage
in
the
community.
they
have
to
pay
certain
specific
findings
made.
then,
the
authority
is
incorporated
under
state
law
as
a
governmental
agency
--
under
state
law.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
how
are
they
chosen?
i'm
--
my
--
mr.
edwards
has
indicated
they're
appointed
by
the
mayor
of
the
municipality.
i
can't
find
the
statutory
reference
to
that.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
the
mayor
of
the
council
here.
i'm
sure
it's
in
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
157-4
which
is
the
statute.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
it's
page
9
(a)
in
the
petitioner's
brief.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
9
(a)
appendix.
now,
as
i
said
at
the
beginning,
it
seems
to
us
that
it's
a
common
place
in
administrative
law
that
governmental
agencies
grant
notice
and
hearings
before
taking
actions
which
significantly
disadvantage
a
citizen.
particularly,
this
is
true
where
the
action
is
based
on
what
amounts
to
adjudication
that
a
citizen
is
guilty
of
misconduct,
in
effect.
our
tradition
of
due
process
rejects
the
idea
of
ex
parte
kind
of
missions.
mr.
justice
frankfurter
once
put
it
that
fairness
can
rarely
be
obtained
by
secret
one-sided
determinations
of
facts
decisive
of
rights,
and
the
court
has
applied
that
view.
the
court
has
applied
that
principle
in
numerous
cases.
as
recently
as
a
few
terms
ago,
a
case
called
willner
against
the
committee
on
character
and
fitness,
the
principle
was
applied
to
a
lawyer
who
was
--
whose
profess
--
whose
right
to
practice
law
was
at
stake.
it
was
applied
as
long
ago
--
it
was
applied
to
meat
packers,
as
long
as
--
ago
as
the
famous
morgan
cases.
the
same
principle
was
true
to
the
engineer
that
was
denied
a
security
clearance
and,
therefore,
whose
right
to
earn
a
living
was
at
stake
in
greene
against
mcelroy.
so,
i
emphasize
here
that
the
issue
in
this
case
is
primarily,
i
think,
a
question
of
procedural
due
process,
to
use
mr.
justice
brandeis'
phrase,
“due
process
in
the
primary
sense
of
an
opportunity
to
be
heard
and
to
defend.”
i
think
the
case
does
not
involve
whether
there's
a
right
to
public
housing
for
all
--
for
all
the
poor.
think
it
does
not
necessarily
involve
even
what
grounds
might
justify
evictions
but,
rather,
only
what
procedures
due
process
of
law
requires
if
benefits
are
to
be
terminated.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
it's
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
yes.
i
would
submit
that
the
right
is
the
right
to
be
treated
fairly
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
by
the
governmental
agency
when
it's
determining
whether
or
not
to
terminate
your
benefits
under
a
federal
benefit
program
is
the
right
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
it's
the
right
--
the
right
to
fair
procedures.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
well,
to
address
myself,
if
i
may,
mr.
justice
fortas,
to
the
first
part
of
your
question
as
to
whether
or
not
they
can
terminate
just
because
they
were
tired
of
having
her
here
--
or
having
here
there.
it
seems
to
me
that
you
have
to
focus
on
the
statutory
framework
and
the
permissible
kinds
of
things
the
authority
can
do
under
the
statute.
a
pri
--
in
deed,
a
private
landlord
could
evict
someone
because
he
wants
to
make
more
profit
or
he
wants
the
apartment
for
his
brother-in-law
or
because
he
wants
to
tear
a
building
down
or
anyone
of
the
reasons
you
could
think.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
but,
the
housing
authority
can't
have
these
reasons.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
the
purpose
of
the
program
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
yes,
the
purpose
of
the
program
is
to
house
poor
people,
and
they
can't
leave
it
vacant
and
obey
their
duty
under
the
statute.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
that's
right.
there
has
to
be
a
reason
under
the
statute.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
there
would
have
to
be
a
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
well,
the
statute
does
give
us
some
guidelines,
section
1410
(g)
which
is
in
our
brief
at
14
--
page
3
(a)
of
the
appendix,
1410
(g)
(2),
does
layout
the
general
considerations
that
the
government
once
considered
in
this
program.
let
me
read
it.
it
says
that
it
refers
to
admission
policies,
but
i
take
it
that
the
admission
policies
and
the
right
to
remain,
that
congress
would
want
the
same
policy,
general
principles,
filed.
so,
as
the
public
housing
agency
shall
adopt
and
promulgate
regulations,
establishing
admission
policies
which
they'll
give
full
consideration
to
its
responsibility
for
the
re-housing
of
displaced
families
to
the
applicant
status
as
a
serviceman
or
veteran
or
relationship
to
a
serviceman
or
veteran
or
disabled
serviceman
or
veteran
to
the
applicants
age
or
disability,
housing
conditions,
urgency
of
housing
need,
and
source
of
income,
provided
that
in
establishing
such
admission
policies,
public
housing
agencies
shall
accord
families
of
low
income
such
priority
over
single
persons,
as
it
determines
to
be
necessary
to
avoid
undue
hardship.
so,
for
example,
if
a
hearing
developed
that
a
housing
agency
was
evicting
a
family
in
order
to
put
single
persons
in
or
not
giving
preference
to
the
veterans,
they
would
be
doing
something
that
was
quite
opposed
to
this
after
cost.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
yes,
that's
correct.
that's,
roughly,
yes.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
mr.
justice
marshall,
your
question
suggests
to
me
that
it's
relevant
to
analyze
what
the
tenant
has
at
stake
in
this,
what
the
authority
has
at
stake
in
determining
what
procedures
fairness
requires.
our
position
--
what
we
rely
on
is
the
due
process
clause.
now,
it
seems
to
me
it's
useful
to
look
at
the
interest
of
a
tenant
who
was
in
a
low-rent
federal
housing
project.
in
the
first
place,
it
--
the
general
framework
of
it
is
pretty
well-defined
by
the
state
and
federal
statutes.
we
know
merely
from
looking
at
the
statutes
that
the
housing
project
wouldn't
be
built
in
the
first
place
without
specific
finding
that
there's
a
shortage
of
housing
in
the
community.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
i
think
that
the
issue
we're
--
the
first
amendment
component
is
a
part
of
our
case,
but
my
answer
is
yes
because
these
authorities
contend
that
they
have
the
right
to
kick
people
out
without
telling
time
any
reason
why
and
i
think
that,
alone,
raises
the
due
process
question,
the
question
of
procedural
facts.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
why
wouldn't
it
be?
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
because
it's
federal
--
yes.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
i
can
assume
that
that's
so
and
i
can
assume
that
argument.
i
don't
address
myself
to
that
question.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
i
agreed
with
that.
agreed
with
that.
i
said
i
assume
that
this
case
doesn't
implicate
the
rights
of
non-governmental
agencies,
in
terms
of
their
leases.
this
case
depends
on
the
fact
that
this
is
a
govern
--
that
this
is
a
government
of
the
landlord.
that's
--
i
was
about
to
address
myself
to
what
the
tenant
has
at
stake.
it
seems
to
me,
just
looking
at
the
statute
alone
that,
obviously,
if
tenants
who
are
eligible
to
get
in
these
projects
are
evicted,
they
stand
to
lose
the
only
chance
they
have
to
homes
which
they
can
afford
which
are
decent,
safe,
and
sanitary.
so
that,
what
the
tenant
has
at
stake
is
of
great
value,
whether
you
call
it
a
right,
a
privilege,
or
what
not.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
what's
at
stake
is
the
right
to
have
--
i'm
sorry,
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
it's
what
the
court
below
held,
yes.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
i
believe
that
would
be
open
to
the
court.
however,
i
would
urge
that
the
court
dispose
of
the
case
on
the
constitutional
grounds
that
the
court
first
agreed
to
review
the
case.
i
think
that
there
are
many
other
cases
pending
which
involve
these
same
issues.
the
housing
program
is
growing
everyday
and
the
issue
needs
to
be
decided.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
and
that
the
decision
on
the
circular
--
i'm
sorry,
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
well
i
--
not
entirely.
i
think
the
c
--
that
the
circular
would
have
to
be
construed
in
order
to
give
meaning,
give
content
to
this
general
provision
that
you
should
have
--
that
they'll
have
a
conference
that
the
circular
is
not
very
specific.
it
seems
to
me
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
well,
it's
a
little
more
specific.
it
indicates,
for
example,
some
details
about
what
the
notice
has
to
contain,
but
it's
not
very
clear,
you're
correct.
it's
not
very
clear.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
no.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
no,
we
--
mr.
justice
harlan,
we
do
not
contend
for
a
full-fledged
evidentiary
hearing.
we
think
that
the
department
of
housing
and
urban
development
can
work
out
something
that's
practical
in
the
circumstances,
but
what
they
do
need
to
be
told
is
that
these
tenant
evictions
that
these
housing
authorities
have
an
obligation
of
fairness
and
to
pay
some
attention
to
procedural
fairness.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
it
seems
to
me
that
it's
open
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
before
the
agency.
it
seems
to
me
that
it's
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
yes.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
yes.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
i
don't
believe
the
authority
could
exclude
a
lawyer
or
another
personal
representative
or
a
social
worker
or
some
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
family
friend.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
that
would
not.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
well,
mr.
justice
black,
i
think
it's
a
single
--
it's
a
process,
the
administrative
process
and
the
judicial
process
in
these
cases
have
to
be
looked
at
together
and
that,
perhaps,
if
you
get
more
rights
at
an
earlier
stage,
that
effects
the
necessary
scope
of
judicial
review.
in
other
words,
if
you
have
a
very
perfunctory
administrative
proceeding,
then
you
need
a
full
and
fair
judicial
proceeding.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
i
think
not.
it
seems
to
me
that,
under
this
particular
statute
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
let
me
--
the
reason
i
think
not
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
mr.
justice
white,
i
think
not,
and
for
this
reason.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
north
carolina
law
is
very
clear
that
the
only
question
open
to
the
court
to
decide
in
the
summary
vision
--
eviction
proceeding
under
this
statute
is,
number
one,
whether
the
person
is
a
tenant
and,
number
two,
whether
they're
holding
over
after
the
term
is
over
that's
been
the
law
in
north
carolina,
under
this
statute
as
long
as
the
statute
has
been
there.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
and
then
it's
entirely
consistent.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
well
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
i
have
--
i
really
have
several
answers
to
that.
the
last
thing
you
mentioned
is
one
of
them.
that,
in
fact,
in
north
carolina,
it's
not
open
to
you
to
do
this.
now,
i
don't
deny,
for
a
moment,
it's
possible
to
device
a
judicial
proceeding
that
could
give
you
a
hearing
on
the
relevant
issues,
but
i
suggest
that
that's
not
available
now.
the
second
thing
that
hasn't
been
said
and
i
should
say,
mr.
justice
white,
is
this,
that
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
there
are
not
any
re
--
there
are
not
any
reasons
for
which
you
must
evict
someone
form
housing.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
so
--
and,
finally,
it's
a
discretionary
decision
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
by
the
housing
manager.
this
--
no
one
suggested
the
court
is
ever
going
to
make
that
kind
of
discretionary
judgment.
it's
that
decision
which
ought
to
be
made
fairly,
which
ought
to
be
made
in
accordance
with
fair
procedures
and
it's
that
s
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
that's
it,
and
there
is
a
--
that's
what
the
statute
says.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
that
proceeding
would
be
brought
under
another
subsection
of
the
law.
if
i
could
refer
the
court
to
the
statute,
the
north
carolina
summary
evictions
statute,
if
i
had
myself,
it's
at
page
21
(a)
of
petitioner's
appendix.
and,
it
provides
for
an
eviction
under
subsection
1,
when
a
tenant
in
possession
of
real
estate
holds
over
after
his
term
has
expired.
that's
what's
involved
here.
and,
under
subsection
2,
when
the
tenant
has
breached
the
lease
after
alleged
cause
and
they
proceed
under
subsection
2,
then
they
allege
that
the
tenant
didn't
pay
rent
or
the
tenants
scratched
up
the
walls
in
breach
of
the
lease,
then
they
have
to
prove
it.
but,
if
they
allege
that
the
term
is
over,
that
he's
holding
over
after
the
lease
expired
under
subsection
1,
then
that's
all
they
have
to
prove.
and
if
the
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
but,
he
first
page
of
the
reco
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
that's
right.
that's
all
they
have
to
prove,
as
i
gave
the
statutory
notice.
that's
all
i
have
to
prove
and
the
lease.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
that's
right,
and
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina
held
that
that
reason
is
immaterial.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
and
that's
entirely
in
accord
with
north
carolina
practice
of
it.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
i
suppose
that
the
court
was
being
careful,
but
the
trial
court
also
said
that
there
was
no
obligation
to
give
a
release.
trial
court
also
held
that.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
my
position,
mr.
justice
white,
is
that
this
constitutional
right
to
certain
elements
of
fairness,
at
some
stage
of
this
procedure,
anything
from
the
beginning
of
the
administrative
procedure
to
the
end
of
the
judicial
procedure.
i
don't
have
any
rigid
notion
of
where
you
have
to
get
your
rights
but,
it
seems
to
me,
some
place
in
that
proceeding,
the
tenant
ought
to
be
--
where
the
government
is
the
landlord,
the
tenant
ought
to
be
told
why
he's
being
terminated,
why
his
benefits
are
being
terminated,
and
have
an
opportunity
to
address
himself
to
that.
in
additionally,
it
seems
to
me
that,
at
least
on
the
question
of
notice
of
the
reasons
and
some
minimal
opportunity
to
address
himself
to,
the
tenant
ought
to
have
that
at
the
administrative
stage.
i
say
that,
particularly
where
we
have
low-income
tenants
who
are
unlikely
to
be
able
to
afford
lawyers
and
afford
to
go
to
court,
and
they
certainly
can't
afford
to
go
to
court
to
fight
an
eviction
if
they
don't
know
why
they're
being
evicted.
it
seems
to
me,
the
housing
authority
also
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
well,
i
--
yes,
i
think
it
can
be
read
to
apply
to
this
pending
case,
and
the
reason
i
think
that
is
that
it's
entirely
conventional,
it
seems
to
me,
to
apply
new
procedural
rules
to
cases
where
the
judgment
is
not
yet
final.
i
think,
further,
that's
entirely
artificial
to
view
this
case,
as
the
authority
does,
as
one
where
they're
being
deprived
of
some
property
because,
as
we
said
earlier,
they're
going
to
rent
the
same
apartment
to
somebody
else
at
the
same
rent.
so
that
by
requiring
them
to
go
back
and
give
the
tenant
the
reason
she's
being
evicted,
it
seems
to
me,
doesn't
deprive
them
of
anything.
it
just
makes
them
be
fair
to
the
tenant.
i
wanted
to
complete
an
answer
to
the
prior
question
and
say,
also,
it
seems
to
me,
important
that
the
authority
to
be
made
to
state
a
reason
at
the
administrative
level
so
that
they
will
have
a
reason,
and
so
that
the
reason
they
later
present
in
court
is
not
a
post
factor
justification
for
something
that
they
decide
earlier.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
person
who
makes
the
decision
to
terminate
government
benefits
like
this
ought
to
be
able
to
be
required,
if
we
are
to
--
if
he's
to
operate
under
law,
he
ought
to
be
required
to
say
why
he's
out.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
for
the
second
time
to
review
a
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
north
carolina
affirming
an
order
that
petitioner
and
her
four
children
be
evicted
from
a
low-income
public
housing
project
in
durham,
north
carolina.
the
question
for
decision
is
whether
tenants
in
federally
financed
projects,
operated
under
the
united
states
housing
act
of
1937
as
amended,
may
be
evicted
from
their
homes
and
their
federal
benefits
terminated
without
being
told
any
reason
or
given
any
opportunity
to
be
heard
in
their
own
defense
before
the
decision
to
evict
is
made
by
the
housing
authorities.
now,
let
me
emphasize
at
the
outset
that,
in
our
view,
the
fundamental
underlying
question
here
is
whether
poor
people
who
depend
on
the
government
for
the
necessities
of
life,
for
shelter,
whether
poor
people
will
get
the
same
kind
of
procedural
rights
and
protections
that
our
citizen
--
that
our
system
has
long
given
to
more
fortunate
citizens
and
their
contacts
with
government
administrators.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
no,
your
honor.
i
wouldn't
contend
that.
i
said
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
i
said
more
fortunate
citizens
and
their
contacts
with
the
government.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
it's
our
position,
may
it
please
the
court,
that
it's
a
common
place
of
administrative
law
when,
in
all
sorts
of
situations,
when
a
professional
man's
license
is
threatened
to
with
revocation,
when
a
security,
as
in
the
goldsmith
case
or
in
the
willner
case
last
year,
if
--
to
get
a
notice
in
a
hearing,
it
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
well,
the
thing
that
i
--
the
difference
i
perceive
is
the
difference
in
the
purpose
of
the
program
because
the
purpose
of
this
program
under
the
housing
act
is
to
provide
housing
for
poor
people.
it's
a
government
benefit
program.
so
that,
to
the
extent
that
there's
--
that
there
are
differences
between
government
benefit
programs
and
incidental
programs
to
the
management
of
connected
with
inc
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
programs
could
--
incidental
to
the
management
of
government
buildings.
you
may
have
different
principles
to
apply.
so,
my
argument
is
not
addressed
to
that,
mr.
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
well,
i
agree
that
these
issues
about
the
rights
of
the
poor
are
a
challenge
to
us
all,
but
there
are
none
without
difficulties.
let's
look
at
the
position
of
the
housing
authority
in
this
case.
they
claim,
after
all
that's
transpired,
after
three
years
of
this
litigation,
they
still
maintain
that
they
don't
even
have
to
have
a
reason,
they
don't
have
to
have
any
cause
to
evict
a
low-income
family
from
its
home.
they
claim
that
they
have
no
duty
to
tell
the
town
anything
or
listen
to
anything
that
the
tenant
has
to
say.
their
position
is,
in
some,
is
that
these
destitute
people
who
pend
on
--
who
depend
on
the
government
for
shelter
don't
have
any
rights,
that
the
auth
--
procedural
rights
that
authority
is
bound
to
respect.
say
i
think
it
is
relevant.
the
point
is
not
lost
on
poor
people
and
that
they
do
understand
what's
going
on
when
the
legal
system
treats
them
this
way.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
now,
let's
look
at
the
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
think
i
agree
with
that.
i
don't
contend
that
there's
a
major
equal
protection
component
to
the
case.
i
think
it's
a
problem.
of
the
principal
problem
in
the
case
is
what
sort
of
procedures
due
process
requires.
when
the
government
is
landlord,
it
deals
with
people.
i
don't
disagree
with
that
at
all.
let's
begin
with
a
few
words
about
this
federal
law,
the
housing
act
of
1937,
so
that
we
have
a
statutory
frame
of
reference
for
the
consti
--
to
discuss
the
constitutional
questions.
the
congress
has
declared
that
the
policy
of
using
federal
funds
and
credit
to
remedy
the
unsafe
and
unsanitary
housing
conditions
and
their
acute
shortage
of
decent,
safe,
and
sanitary
dwellings
for
families
of
low-income.
now,
housing
in
this
particular
program
is
provided
only
for
families
“who
are
in
the
lowest
income
group
and
cannot
afford
to
pay
enough
to
cause
private
enterprise
to
build
an
adequate
supply
of
decent,
safe,
and
sanitary
dwellings
for
their
use.
now,
the
subsidies
in
this
program,
although
it's
operated
by
local
housing
authorities,
the
subsidies
are
almost
entirely
100%
federal.
the
permanent
financing
of
these
projects
is
done
by
bonds
sold
by
the
local
authorities.
and
if
the
federal
law
subsidizes
these
bonds
in
several
ways.
first,
they
make
the
interest
n
the
bonds
federally
tax-exempt
which
has
the
effect
of
lowering
the
interest
rate.
then,
the
government
of
the
united
states
places
its
credit,
the
credit
of
the
united
states,
to
assure
the
payment
of
the
bonds
and
under
an
annual
contributions
contract
with
the
local
authorities,
the
united
states
agrees
to
pay
up
to
100%
on
the
debt
service
on
the
bonds.
the
local
authorities
apply
their
net
receipts
to
the
payment
of
the
debt
service
and
any
difference
the
united
states
makes
up.
with
some
projects,
the
united
states
does
pay
100%
of
the
debt
service.
in
addition,
the
united
states
makes
ca
--
additional
cash
contributions
for
elderly
families
and
on
account
on
displaced
families,
families
displaced
by
federal
projects
and,
finally,
the
united
states
pays
the
administrative
cost
of
the
housing
assistance
administration,
a
part
of
haa
itself.
now,
the
state
and
local
governments,
rather
than
subsidizing
the
projects,
in
some
case
actually
gain
revenue
from
there
by
receiving
payments
in
lieu
of
local
real
estate
taxes
from
these
housing
authorities
which,
under
the
statute,
may
amount
to
up
to
10%
of
the
rental
income
of
the
projects.
there
are
now
2.6
million
people
in
the
united
states
living
in
these
federally
assisted
projects.
perhaps
a
quarter
of
a
million
of
them
have
moved
in
these
projects
since
this
case
was
last
argued
here
a
year-and-a
half
ago.
the
program
is
rapidly
expanding.
about
half
of
these
people
are
black,
about
a
third
of
them
are
elderly,
their
medium-family
income
is
little
over
$2,700,
and
the
average
rent
they
pay
is
about
$50
and
those
figures
are
for
1967.
of
the
petitioner
was
found
eligible
as
she
moved
into
her
apartment
at
$29
a
month
in
november
of
1964.
her
lease
gave
--
her
lease
was
a
month-to-month
tenancy.
it
gave
both
the
tenant
and
the
authority
the
right
to
terminate
by
giving
15
days
notice
before
the
end
of
any
month,
and
she
lived
in
the
project
without
any
incident
for
8-9
months.
in
august
--
on
august
10,
to
be
precise,
of
1965,
mrs.
thorpe
was
elected
president
of
a
tenant's
organization
that
was
being
organized
in
the
project.
and,
the
very
next
day,
the
authority
sent
her
a
notice
that
her
lease
was
terminated
at
the
end
of
that
month.
several
times
she
asked
for
a
hearing,
she
was
told
only
that
the
authority
was
not
required
to
give
a
reason
for
--
or
a
hearing.
and,
when
she
did
not
move
out,
this
present
suit
for
summary
eviction
was
brought
in
the
state
courts
which
ordered
her
eviction.
the
state
supreme
court
ruled
on
the
first
appeal
that
the
lease
was
terminated
the
ter
--
because
the
term
had
expired
that
the
auth
--
that
the
reason
the
authority
terminated
was
immaterial
and
this
court
granted
review
during
the
october
term
1966.
after
argument
here
in
this
court,
a
year-and-a
half
ago,
the
case
was
remanded
to
the
court
below
to
reconsider
it
in
view
of
a
supervening
event
in
administrative
direction
directive
circular
issued
by
the
department
of
housing
and
urban
development,
which
directed
that
tenants
not
be
given
notices
to
vacate
without
being
told
the
reasons
and
an
opportunity
to
reply
or
explain.
on
remand,
the
court
below
again
affirmed
stating
that
its
prior
judgme
--
its
prior
opinion
stood.
it
stood
by
it
and
ruling
that
the
circular
was
inapplicable
because
issued
after
the
lease,
the
termination
notice,
and
the
court
orders.
so,
mrs.
thorpe
remains
in
her
apartment
under
stay
orders
issued
throughout
these
appeals.
now

mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
authority
is
created
under
a
north
carolina
statute
called
the
north
carolina
housing
authorities
law.
it's
general
statutes
of
north
carolina
section
157.1.
the
--
it's
the
--
well,
actually,
section
157.4
describes
in
some
detail
the
process.
petition
there
could
be
filed
by
petition
by
taxpayers.
they
have
to
have
hearings
to
determine
whether
or
not
there's
a
housing
shortage
in
the
community.
they
have
to
pay
certain
specific
findings
made.
then,
the
authority
is
incorporated
under
state
law
as
a
governmental
agency
--
under
state
law.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
how
are
they
chosen?
i'm
--
my
--
mr.
edwards
has
indicated
they're
appointed
by
the
mayor
of
the
municipality.
i
can't
find
the
statutory
reference
to
that.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
the
mayor
of
the
council
here.
i'm
sure
it's
in
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
157-4
which
is
the
statute.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
it's
page
9
(a)
in
the
petitioner's
brief.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
9
(a)
appendix.
now,
as
i
said
at
the
beginning,
it
seems
to
us
that
it's
a
common
place
in
administrative
law
that
governmental
agencies
grant
notice
and
hearings
before
taking
actions
which
significantly
disadvantage
a
citizen.
particularly,
this
is
true
where
the
action
is
based
on
what
amounts
to
adjudication
that
a
citizen
is
guilty
of
misconduct,
in
effect.
our
tradition
of
due
process
rejects
the
idea
of
ex
parte
kind
of
missions.
mr.
justice
frankfurter
once
put
it
that
fairness
can
rarely
be
obtained
by
secret
one-sided
determinations
of
facts
decisive
of
rights,
and
the
court
has
applied
that
view.
the
court
has
applied
that
principle
in
numerous
cases.
as
recently
as
a
few
terms
ago,
a
case
called
willner
against
the
committee
on
character
and
fitness,
the
principle
was
applied
to
a
lawyer
who
was
--
whose
profess
--
whose
right
to
practice
law
was
at
stake.
it
was
applied
as
long
ago
--
it
was
applied
to
meat
packers,
as
long
as
--
ago
as
the
famous
morgan
cases.
the
same
principle
was
true
to
the
engineer
that
was
denied
a
security
clearance
and,
therefore,
whose
right
to
earn
a
living
was
at
stake
in
greene
against
mcelroy.
so,
i
emphasize
here
that
the
issue
in
this
case
is
primarily,
i
think,
a
question
of
procedural
due
process,
to
use
mr.
justice
brandeis'
phrase,
“due
process
in
the
primary
sense
of
an
opportunity
to
be
heard
and
to
defend.”
i
think
the
case
does
not
involve
whether
there's
a
right
to
public
housing
for
all
--
for
all
the
poor.
think
it
does
not
necessarily
involve
even
what
grounds
might
justify
evictions
but,
rather,
only
what
procedures
due
process
of
law
requires
if
benefits
are
to
be
terminated.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
it's
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
yes.
i
would
submit
that
the
right
is
the
right
to
be
treated
fairly
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
by
the
governmental
agency
when
it's
determining
whether
or
not
to
terminate
your
benefits
under
a
federal
benefit
program
is
the
right
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
it's
the
right
--
the
right
to
fair
procedures.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
well,
to
address
myself,
if
i
may,
mr.
justice
fortas,
to
the
first
part
of
your
question
as
to
whether
or
not
they
can
terminate
just
because
they
were
tired
of
having
her
here
--
or
having
here
there.
it
seems
to
me
that
you
have
to
focus
on
the
statutory
framework
and
the
permissible
kinds
of
things
the
authority
can
do
under
the
statute.
a
pri
--
in
deed,
a
private
landlord
could
evict
someone
because
he
wants
to
make
more
profit
or
he
wants
the
apartment
for
his
brother-in-law
or
because
he
wants
to
tear
a
building
down
or
anyone
of
the
reasons
you
could
think.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
but,
the
housing
authority
can't
have
these
reasons.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
the
purpose
of
the
program
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
yes,
the
purpose
of
the
program
is
to
house
poor
people,
and
they
can't
leave
it
vacant
and
obey
their
duty
under
the
statute.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
that's
right.
there
has
to
be
a
reason
under
the
statute.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
there
would
have
to
be
a
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
well,
the
statute
does
give
us
some
guidelines,
section
1410
(g)
which
is
in
our
brief
at
14
--
page
3
(a)
of
the
appendix,
1410
(g)
(2),
does
layout
the
general
considerations
that
the
government
once
considered
in
this
program.
let
me
read
it.
it
says
that
it
refers
to
admission
policies,
but
i
take
it
that
the
admission
policies
and
the
right
to
remain,
that
congress
would
want
the
same
policy,
general
principles,
filed.
so,
as
the
public
housing
agency
shall
adopt
and
promulgate
regulations,
establishing
admission
policies
which
they'll
give
full
consideration
to
its
responsibility
for
the
re-housing
of
displaced
families
to
the
applicant
status
as
a
serviceman
or
veteran
or
relationship
to
a
serviceman
or
veteran
or
disabled
serviceman
or
veteran
to
the
applicants
age
or
disability,
housing
conditions,
urgency
of
housing
need,
and
source
of
income,
provided
that
in
establishing
such
admission
policies,
public
housing
agencies
shall
accord
families
of
low
income
such
priority
over
single
persons,
as
it
determines
to
be
necessary
to
avoid
undue
hardship.
so,
for
example,
if
a
hearing
developed
that
a
housing
agency
was
evicting
a
family
in
order
to
put
single
persons
in
or
not
giving
preference
to
the
veterans,
they
would
be
doing
something
that
was
quite
opposed
to
this
after
cost.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
yes,
that's
correct.
that's,
roughly,
yes.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
mr.
justice
marshall,
your
question
suggests
to
me
that
it's
relevant
to
analyze
what
the
tenant
has
at
stake
in
this,
what
the
authority
has
at
stake
in
determining
what
procedures
fairness
requires.
our
position
--
what
we
rely
on
is
the
due
process
clause.
now,
it
seems
to
me
it's
useful
to
look
at
the
interest
of
a
tenant
who
was
in
a
low-rent
federal
housing
project.
in
the
first
place,
it
--
the
general
framework
of
it
is
pretty
well-defined
by
the
state
and
federal
statutes.
we
know
merely
from
looking
at
the
statutes
that
the
housing
project
wouldn't
be
built
in
the
first
place
without
specific
finding
that
there's
a
shortage
of
housing
in
the
community.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
i
think
that
the
issue
we're
--
the
first
amendment
component
is
a
part
of
our
case,
but
my
answer
is
yes
because
these
authorities
contend
that
they
have
the
right
to
kick
people
out
without
telling
time
any
reason
why
and
i
think
that,
alone,
raises
the
due
process
question,
the
question
of
procedural
facts.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
why
wouldn't
it
be?
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
because
it's
federal
--
yes.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
i
can
assume
that
that's
so
and
i
can
assume
that
argument.
i
don't
address
myself
to
that
question.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
i
agreed
with
that.
agreed
with
that.
i
said
i
assume
that
this
case
doesn't
implicate
the
rights
of
non-governmental
agencies,
in
terms
of
their
leases.
this
case
depends
on
the
fact
that
this
is
a
govern
--
that
this
is
a
government
of
the
landlord.
that's
--
i
was
about
to
address
myself
to
what
the
tenant
has
at
stake.
it
seems
to
me,
just
looking
at
the
statute
alone
that,
obviously,
if
tenants
who
are
eligible
to
get
in
these
projects
are
evicted,
they
stand
to
lose
the
only
chance
they
have
to
homes
which
they
can
afford
which
are
decent,
safe,
and
sanitary.
so
that,
what
the
tenant
has
at
stake
is
of
great
value,
whether
you
call
it
a
right,
a
privilege,
or
what
not.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
what's
at
stake
is
the
right
to
have
--
i'm
sorry,
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
it's
what
the
court
below
held,
yes.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
i
believe
that
would
be
open
to
the
court.
however,
i
would
urge
that
the
court
dispose
of
the
case
on
the
constitutional
grounds
that
the
court
first
agreed
to
review
the
case.
i
think
that
there
are
many
other
cases
pending
which
involve
these
same
issues.
the
housing
program
is
growing
everyday
and
the
issue
needs
to
be
decided.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
and
that
the
decision
on
the
circular
--
i'm
sorry,
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
well
i
--
not
entirely.
i
think
the
c
--
that
the
circular
would
have
to
be
construed
in
order
to
give
meaning,
give
content
to
this
general
provision
that
you
should
have
--
that
they'll
have
a
conference
that
the
circular
is
not
very
specific.
it
seems
to
me
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
well,
it's
a
little
more
specific.
it
indicates,
for
example,
some
details
about
what
the
notice
has
to
contain,
but
it's
not
very
clear,
you're
correct.
it's
not
very
clear.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
no.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
no,
we
--
mr.
justice
harlan,
we
do
not
contend
for
a
full-fledged
evidentiary
hearing.
we
think
that
the
department
of
housing
and
urban
development
can
work
out
something
that's
practical
in
the
circumstances,
but
what
they
do
need
to
be
told
is
that
these
tenant
evictions
that
these
housing
authorities
have
an
obligation
of
fairness
and
to
pay
some
attention
to
procedural
fairness.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
it
seems
to
me
that
it's
open
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
before
the
agency.
it
seems
to
me
that
it's
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
yes.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
yes.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
i
don't
believe
the
authority
could
exclude
a
lawyer
or
another
personal
representative
or
a
social
worker
or
some
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
family
friend.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
that
would
not.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
well,
mr.
justice
black,
i
think
it's
a
single
--
it's
a
process,
the
administrative
process
and
the
judicial
process
in
these
cases
have
to
be
looked
at
together
and
that,
perhaps,
if
you
get
more
rights
at
an
earlier
stage,
that
effects
the
necessary
scope
of
judicial
review.
in
other
words,
if
you
have
a
very
perfunctory
administrative
proceeding,
then
you
need
a
full
and
fair
judicial
proceeding.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
i
think
not.
it
seems
to
me
that,
under
this
particular
statute
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
let
me
--
the
reason
i
think
not
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
mr.
justice
white,
i
think
not,
and
for
this
reason.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
north
carolina
law
is
very
clear
that
the
only
question
open
to
the
court
to
decide
in
the
summary
vision
--
eviction
proceeding
under
this
statute
is,
number
one,
whether
the
person
is
a
tenant
and,
number
two,
whether
they're
holding
over
after
the
term
is
over
that's
been
the
law
in
north
carolina,
under
this
statute
as
long
as
the
statute
has
been
there.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
and
then
it's
entirely
consistent.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
well
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
i
have
--
i
really
have
several
answers
to
that.
the
last
thing
you
mentioned
is
one
of
them.
that,
in
fact,
in
north
carolina,
it's
not
open
to
you
to
do
this.
now,
i
don't
deny,
for
a
moment,
it's
possible
to
device
a
judicial
proceeding
that
could
give
you
a
hearing
on
the
relevant
issues,
but
i
suggest
that
that's
not
available
now.
the
second
thing
that
hasn't
been
said
and
i
should
say,
mr.
justice
white,
is
this,
that
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
there
are
not
any
re
--
there
are
not
any
reasons
for
which
you
must
evict
someone
form
housing.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
so
--
and,
finally,
it's
a
discretionary
decision
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
by
the
housing
manager.
this
--
no
one
suggested
the
court
is
ever
going
to
make
that
kind
of
discretionary
judgment.
it's
that
decision
which
ought
to
be
made
fairly,
which
ought
to
be
made
in
accordance
with
fair
procedures
and
it's
that
s
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
that's
it,
and
there
is
a
--
that's
what
the
statute
says.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
that
proceeding
would
be
brought
under
another
subsection
of
the
law.
if
i
could
refer
the
court
to
the
statute,
the
north
carolina
summary
evictions
statute,
if
i
had
myself,
it's
at
page
21
(a)
of
petitioner's
appendix.
and,
it
provides
for
an
eviction
under
subsection
1,
when
a
tenant
in
possession
of
real
estate
holds
over
after
his
term
has
expired.
that's
what's
involved
here.
and,
under
subsection
2,
when
the
tenant
has
breached
the
lease
after
alleged
cause
and
they
proceed
under
subsection
2,
then
they
allege
that
the
tenant
didn't
pay
rent
or
the
tenants
scratched
up
the
walls
in
breach
of
the
lease,
then
they
have
to
prove
it.
but,
if
they
allege
that
the
term
is
over,
that
he's
holding
over
after
the
lease
expired
under
subsection
1,
then
that's
all
they
have
to
prove.
and
if
the
--

m.
nabrit,

but,
he
first
page
of
the
reco
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
that's
right.
that's
all
they
have
to
prove,
as
i
gave
the
statutory
notice.
that's
all
i
have
to
prove
and
the
lease.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
that's
right,
and
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina
held
that
that
reason
is
immaterial.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
and
that's
entirely
in
accord
with
north
carolina
practice
of
it.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
i
suppose
that
the
court
was
being
careful,
but
the
trial
court
also
said
that
there
was
no
obligation
to
give
a
release.
trial
court
also
held
that.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
my
position,
mr.
justice
white,
is
that
this
constitutional
right
to
certain
elements
of
fairness,
at
some
stage
of
this
procedure,
anything
from
the
beginning
of
the
administrative
procedure
to
the
end
of
the
judicial
procedure.
i
don't
have
any
rigid
notion
of
where
you
have
to
get
your
rights
but,
it
seems
to
me,
some
place
in
that
proceeding,
the
tenant
ought
to
be
--
where
the
government
is
the
landlord,
the
tenant
ought
to
be
told
why
he's
being
terminated,
why
his
benefits
are
being
terminated,
and
have
an
opportunity
to
address
himself
to
that.
in
additionally,
it
seems
to
me
that,
at
least
on
the
question
of
notice
of
the
reasons
and
some
minimal
opportunity
to
address
himself
to,
the
tenant
ought
to
have
that
at
the
administrative
stage.
i
say
that,
particularly
where
we
have
low-income
tenants
who
are
unlikely
to
be
able
to
afford
lawyers
and
afford
to
go
to
court,
and
they
certainly
can't
afford
to
go
to
court
to
fight
an
eviction
if
they
don't
know
why
they're
being
evicted.
it
seems
to
me,
the
housing
authority
also
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
well,
i
--
yes,
i
think
it
can
be
read
to
apply
to
this
pending
case,
and
the
reason
i
think
that
is
that
it's
entirely
conventional,
it
seems
to
me,
to
apply
new
procedural
rules
to
cases
where
the
judgment
is
not
yet
final.
i
think,
further,
that's
entirely
artificial
to
view
this
case,
as
the
authority
does,
as
one
where
they're
being
deprived
of
some
property
because,
as
we
said
earlier,
they're
going
to
rent
the
same
apartment
to
somebody
else
at
the
same
rent.
so
that
by
requiring
them
to
go
back
and
give
the
tenant
the
reason
she's
being
evicted,
it
seems
to
me,
doesn't
deprive
them
of
anything.
it
just
makes
them
be
fair
to
the
tenant.
i
wanted
to
complete
an
answer
to
the
prior
question
and
say,
also,
it
seems
to
me,
important
that
the
authority
to
be
made
to
state
a
reason
at
the
administrative
level
so
that
they
will
have
a
reason,
and
so
that
the
reason
they
later
present
in
court
is
not
a
post
factor
justification
for
something
that
they
decide
earlier.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
person
who
makes
the
decision
to
terminate
government
benefits
like
this
ought
to
be
able
to
be
required,
if
we
are
to
--
if
he's
to
operate
under
law,
he
ought
to
be
required
to
say
why
he's
out.
