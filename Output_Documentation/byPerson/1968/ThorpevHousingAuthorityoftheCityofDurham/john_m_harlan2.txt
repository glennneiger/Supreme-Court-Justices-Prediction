i'm
going

ask
you,
do
you
think
the
circular
can
be
retried,
do
you
think
the
terms
of
the
circular
go
as
far
as
your
arguments
that
the
due
process
rights
go?
justice

required
notice
opportunity

drop
them
out

there?

isn't

in
the
jury
hearing?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you're
contending
your
due

argument
is
that's
what
you
have?

could
i
ask
you

mr.

i
follow
up
one

assuming

your

that
problem,
what

i'm
not
quite

that
i
understand
your
view
as
to
what
would
be
your
position
if,
in
an
administrative
--
in
any
summary
eviction
proceedings
that
i
cannot
be
evicted
because
i
have
received
no
reasons
for
my
eviction
period,
what
would
happen
on
that
part?
justice
john
m.

not
a

defense?

right,
and
then,
suppose
that
she
said
“i
want
to
prove
my
answer
to
the
questions
of
the
majority
that
i
was
evicted
because
i
was
a
negro.”
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
she
has
to
make
that
assertion
as
a
matter
of
speculation
or
suspicion,
however
we
feel
about
her,
knew
well
about
her,
she
cannot
explore
as
to
what
the
reasons
have
been?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and,
as
justice
white
suggested,
the
language
in
here
must

north

was
a
little
overbroad.
justice

so,
she
would
get
a
chance.
she
would
have
a
right

get
the
reasons
for
the
