chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
edwards,
let
me
ask
you
this
question.
assume
--
putting
the
question
of
retroactivity
aside
for
a
moment
and
taking
it
as
it
was
when
this
woman
was
first
ejected
from
her
premises,
suppose
this
housing
authority
which
is
appointed
by
the
mayor
of
the
city
was
following
the
practices
of
many
cities
in
the
south
of
resisting
integration
of
any
kind,
and
it
took
the
authori
--
took
the
process
of
throwing
out
every
negro
who
came
into
the
apartment
house
on
15-days
of
notice
without
any
mention
at
all
of
why
it
was
done,
and
absolutely
defeated
the
purpose
of
this
act
was
to
--
which
is
to
give
all
poor
people
an
opportunity
to
have
decent
housing
in
the
community
in
which
they
live.
would
you
say
if
the
commissioners
appointed
by
the
mayor
and
the
manager
that
they
appointed
took
that
kind
of
a
position
and
ejected
every
negro
who
was
--
had
to
be
admitted
to
the
apartment
house
was
regular
and
that
the
negro
could
not
--
no
negro
could
complain
in
the
courts
because
no
reason
was
assigned
for
his
ejection?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
then,
why
shouldn't
he
be
entitled
to
know
if
that
was
the
reason
for
his
ejection
or
if
it
wasn't?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
understood
that
you
thought
that,
because
that
made
a
contract
in
connection
with
this
tenancy,
that
there
was
no
substantial
difference
between
the
case
where
the
government
is
the
landlo
--
is
the
owner
and
the
case
where
the
land
owner
is
a
private
individual.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
all
he'd
have
to
show
would
be
that
“my
contract
with
this
tenant
is
to
the
effect
that
on
15-days
notice,
i
can
terminate
the
tenancy
and
i
don't
have
to
give
any
reason
at
all
for
it.”
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
isn't
true
then
that
the
courts
of
north
carolina
held
that
all
they
had
to
show
was
that
the
15-days
notice
had
been
given.
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
do
we
find
that
articulated
in
your
brief?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
is
there
a
concession
in
your
brief
that
that
they
are
entitled
to?
chief
justice
earl
warren
let
me
read
to
you
from
the
findings
of
the
court
that
i
get
from
the
transcript.
that,
by
giving
the
defendant
written
notice
of
termination
of
her
lease
on
the
august
12,
1965,
the
plaintiff
effectively
terminated
the
tenancy
of
the
lease
of
the
defendants
as
of
august
31,
1965.
then,
she
appealed
to
the
superior
court,
and
this
is
the
judgment
of
the
superior
court,
the
per
curiam
judgment.
it
says
“the
defendant,
having
gone
into
position
as
tenant
of
the
plaintiff
and
having
held
over
without
the
right
to
do
so
after
the
termination
of
her
tenancy,
the
plaintiff
was
entitled
to
bring
summary
ejectment
proceedings
against
her
to
restore
the
plaintiff
to
the
position
of
that
which
belongs
to
it.
