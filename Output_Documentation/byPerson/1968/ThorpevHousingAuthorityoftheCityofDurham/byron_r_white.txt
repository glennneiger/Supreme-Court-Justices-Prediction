justice
byron
r.
white
well,
isn't
there
one
here,
in
any
event,
a
full
fair
hearing
on
the
--
in
the
--
let's
assume
there's
an
eviction
proceeding
brought.
there's
a
tenant
stays
in
and
doesn't
obey
the
notice
to
quit
and
there's
an
eviction
proceeding
brought.
can
the
tenant,
at
some
point
in
that
process,
enjoy
full
due
process
hearing
and
urge
any
defenses
to
the
eviction?
doesn't
state
law
provide
a
opportunity
for
the
tenant
to
challenge
that
eviction?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
the
way
the
case
got
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
the
way
the
case
got
here
and
there
were
full
findings
on
what
--
on
the
question
of
whether
this
--
whether
the
alleged
reason
was
the
reason
or
not.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
let's
assume
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
let's
assume
for
the
moment
that,
in
the
eviction
hearing,
the
tenant
attempts
to
urge
that
she
was
evicted
because
of
--
she
exercised
some
constitutional
rights,
and
north
carolina
said
“sorry,
we
won't
listen
to
this
reason,
but
it
was
established
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law
that
north
carolina
had
to
listen
to
this
sort
of
a
reason.
now,
what's
wrong
with
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
just
don't
think
--
you
just
don't
think
that
the
north
carolina
hearing
in
the
north
carolina
courts
that
a
tenant
gets
is
the
equivalent
of
a
full
due
process
hearing.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
what
can
it
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
understand
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
tell
me
the
problem
with
the
north
carolina
due
--
hearing
when
the
landlord
brings
an
eviction
notice.
you
say
the
owner
brings
an
eviction
case.
the
only
question
that's
open
is,
is
the
term
over
and
is
he
still
there?
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
when
the
term
is
ended
because
of
some
right
of
re-entry
based
on
some
act
of
the
tenant.
isn't
there
any
room
for
the
tenant
to
challenge?
let's
assume
the
landlord
says
“we
terminate
because
you
scratched
up
the
walls
of
the
apartment,”
and
the
tenant
says
“i
haven't
either.”
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
the
lease
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
lease
expired
only
because
the
landlord
gave
a
notice.
justice
byron
r.
white
and,
for
no
--
that
doesn't
make
any
difference
for
what
reason.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but,
why
did
the
trial
court
make
some
findings
on
this
question?
because
the
trial
court
made
findings
on
it
and
the
north
carolina
court
didn't
--
resided
this
fact
of
finding.
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
for
the
moment
though
that
there
was
a
full
due
--
that
the
tenant
--
that
could've
--
bring
to
bear
all
the
questions
that
you
think
he
ought
to
be
able
to
bring
to
bear
in
the
administrative
hearing.
just
suppose
that
north
carolina
eviction
proceeding
permitted
him
to
do
that.
would
you
say
there
would
have
to
be
a
constitutional
--
maybe
the
constitutional
right
to
administrative
hearing
prior
to
that
time?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
your
eviction
process?
justice
byron
r.
white
then,
the
supremacy
clause
would
also
require
consideration
of
any
binding
rules
of
the
federal
authority.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
could
utilize
her
by
throwing
her
out,
but
you
haven't
done
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
can
i
ask
you
if
in
the
--
you
say
that
the
eviction
hearing
--
in
the
eviction
hearing,
federal
issues
may
be
raised
and
litigated
and
disposed
of,
and
you
seem
to
say
that
it
would
be
required.
i
agree
with
you
but,
now,
let's
assume
that
the
--
let's
assume
that
in
the
eviction
hearing
the
lessee
that's
being
evicted
says
“i
am
being
evicted
because
i
organize
the
tenants
or
i
made
a
speech,”
and
the
administrative
housing
authority
goes
on
the
stand,
as
he
did
in
this
case,
in
the
eviction
hearing,
i
take
it,
and
said
“no,
that
isn't
the
reason
at
all.”
and,
the
lawyer
for
the
tenant
says
“what
reason
was
there?”
and
he
says
“none
of
your
business.”
now
can
he
get
away
with
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
he
have
to
answer
the
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
and,
what
if
he
said
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
he
says
“no
reason
at
all
i
just
didn't
like
you.”?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
then,
how
does
the
eviction
hearing
come
out?
justice
byron
r.
white
unless
there
were
some
federal
rule
that
says
some
reasons,
there
has
to
be
some
good
reason.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
there
aren't
any
sp
--
un
--
there
aren't
any
banned
reason
except
constitutional
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
on
page
21?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
the
north
carolina
court
did
have
that
attitude
that
it's
immaterial,
i
suppose
you
would
concede
they
may
be
in
error.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
you
would
say
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
or
at
least
if
the
state
refuses
to
make
some
form
available
to
enforce
constitutional
rights,
there's
bound
to
be
some
form
somewhere
then.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
you
--
what
if
the
court
here
didn't
agree
with
you
that
the
circular
was
maybe
we
call
it
retroactive
or
not,
at
least
here,
here
came
a
circular
from
hud
before
this
case
was
finally
disposed
of.
it
was
on
appeal
here
or
somewhere
when
the
circular
came
out.
now,
why
shouldn't
the
circular
apply
the
law
announced
by
that
circular
if
it
is
the
law
and
binding?
let's
just
assume
that
it
is.
why
shouldn't
that
law
determine
the
appeal?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
why
shouldn't
the
appeal
be
determined
in
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
would
be
the
normal
rule,
wouldn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
--
if
the
court
thought
this
circular
was
to
be
applied
to
pending
cases,
then
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
do
you
think
it's
binding?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
we
have
to
determine
that
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
take
it
then,
you
must
get
down
to
this
really
because
you
seem
to
concede
the
general
rule
would
be
that
if
this
is
a
binding
rule
of
some
kind,
it
really
ought
to
apply
to
pending
cases.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so,
your
real
last
resort
is
whether
it's
really
binding
on
it,
on
a
local
agency,
whether
this
kind
of
circular
really
determines
--
is
supposed
to
determine
your
conduct.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
suggest
that
you
can
--
may
depart
from
it
now,
although
you're
complying
with
it
now,
you
can
depart
from
it
without
violating
any
kind
of
federal
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
where?
justice
byron
r.
white
where?
in
the
courts?
justice
byron
r.
white
doesn't
this
start
before
the
justice
of
the
peace
really?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
starts
really
before
the
justice
of
the
peace.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
it's
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
it's
de
novo
in
the
superior
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
take
it
that
the
--
somewhere,
i
remember
reading
in
here,
that
the
--
one
of
the
officials
of
the
housing
authority
actually
appears
in
court
before
the
justice
of
the
peace.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
there
was
a
stipulation
about
what
his
testimony
would
be
--
justice
byron
r.
white
in
the
superior
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
and,
although
they
didn't
need
to
sign
that
stipulation,
they
could've
had
him
there.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
isn't
there
one
here,
in
