justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
nabrit,
when
i
assume
that
if
mrs.
thorpe
is
--
what
happens,
she'll
be
replaced
with
another
for
a
family
exactly
the
same
position
that
she's
in?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
exactly
what
constitutional
provision
do
you
rely
on
for
your
due
process
argument?
justice
thurgood
marshall
maybe
i
have
not
made
myself
clear.
let
me
try
again.
but
for
the
fact
that
she
was
elected
president
of
this
tenants
union,
would
you
be
here?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it's
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
only
because
it's
federal
money.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
that
a
member
of
the
authority
who
has
a
private
building
to
put
somebody
out
without
a
hearing,
but
he
could
not
vote
to
put
somebody
out
in
a
public
effect
without
a
hearing?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
you
don't
recognize
the
fact
that
when
a
private
citizen
makes
a
contract
with
another
private
citizen
for
a
rental
of
an
apartment
in
which
he
agrees
that
he
can
be
thrown
out
without
notice,
that
that
can't
be
enforced?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
edwards,
before
you
get
to
it
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
do
recognize
the
difference
between
a
housing
authority
operating
under
state
and
federal
auspices
and
a
private
apartment
of
its
own.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
are
you
familiar
with
the
wilmington
bus
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
wilmington
bus
situation?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
obviously
you
don't,
but
i
mean
that,
once
the
state
takes
over,
it's
not
a
private
business
any
longer.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and,
you
do
recognize
the
right
of
hud
to
set
rules
and
regulations
or
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
don't
recognize
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
that's
why
i
wanted
to
get
this
preliminary
to
this
circular,
because
it
want
to
know
whether
you
say
this
circular
is
binding
or
not.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it's
not,
why?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
the
durham
housing
authority
abiding
by
that
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
or
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
is
abiding
by
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
it
doesn't
consider
it
to
be
retroactive?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
as
of
tomorrow,
a
person
--
mrs.
thorpe,
if
she's
put
back
on
a
regular
stay,
that
she
couldn't
be
put
out
without
a
due
process
hearing?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
since
this
case
is
still
being
litigated,
wouldn't
the
best
way
to
be
is
just
to
get
about
this?
justice
thurgood
marshall
about
this
one
woman,
mrs.
thorpe.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
couldn't
your
clients,
without
any
constitutional
law,
pronounce
if
there's
anything
else,
moot
the
states?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
it
hasn't?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what's
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
can
i
ask
you,
why
is
--
why
are
they
appointed
by
the
mayor?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
it's
just
like
a
private
organization,
renting
company,
why
is
it
appointed
by
the
mayor?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
when
it's
handling
public
funds,
it's
different.
that's
the
point,
isn't
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it's
the
point
as
the
constitution,
is
it
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
could
do
it,
the
durham
housing
authority
couldn't
make
such
a
rule.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
that's
another
difference,
isn't
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and,
isn't
that
what's
involved
in
this
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
