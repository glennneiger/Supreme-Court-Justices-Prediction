mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
mr.
chief
justice
and,
if
the
court
please.
if
--
as
mr.
justice
fortas
has
suggested,
we're
at
the
threshold
here
of
developing
some
new
constitutional
concept
about
the
relationship
of
the
poor
with
the
government.
i
don't
know
whether
i
can
supply
much
thought
that's
worthwhile,
except
this,
that
the
philosophy
that
has
been
developed
in
the
brief
for
the
petitioner
here,
at
least
by
quoting
certain
individuals
such
as
professor
jones
and
professor
rich
on
the
subject,
on
page
36
and
37
of
the
brief
seems
to
have
followed
the
line
of
thought
that
what
we're
doing
is
to
give
the
poor
the
same
rights
and
their
contact
with
government
that
is
possessed
by
other
people,
that
is,
we
equate
the
thing.
and,
that
we
haven't
arrived
yet
in
any
case
that
i
know
of
where
they
are
given
some
different
rights.
now,
when
you
supply
them
with
a
lawyer,
because
they're
poor
and
can't
afford
one,
you're
not
giving
them
additional
rights
in
a
sense.
all
you're
doing
is
equating
them
with
a
fellow
who
can
afford
a
lawyer.
in
this
case,
you
have
a
lease
that
is
a
standard
procedure
between
landlord
and
tenant.
now,
the
question
arises,
do
the
common
law
procedures,
these
common
law
concepts,
common
law
or
the
statutory
laws
that
are
applicable
to
everybody
in
a
landlord
and
tenant
relationship,
do
not
they
supply
reasonable
standards
of
fairness?
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
and,
i'm
sure
that
it
does
not
because
they
are
placed
on
an
equal
basis
here.
now,
the
only
question
then
is
whether
he
wants
to
go
further
than
that,
and
i
say
not.
that
perhaps
that
is
a
matter
that
the
congress
should
consider
as
to
whether
or
not
they
want
to
make
the
relationship
different
and
or
the
state
legislature.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
the
heard
circular
is
the
thing
that
i
would
like
to
take
up
next
then,
if
i
may.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
yes.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
there
are
differences.
i
don't
know.
for
one,
the
difference
would
be
that
i
assume
that
a
housing
authority
could
not
say
“we
will
require
you
to
sign
a
statement
that
you
never
belong
to
certain
organizations
found
by
the
attorney
general
to
be
subversive
that
has
a
condition
to
occupy
these
apartments.”
you
can't
do
that,
or
you
can't
say
that
“you
can't
occupy
these
apartments
if
you
decide
to
vote
or,
if
you
decide
to
make
a
speech
somewhere,
you
can't
occupy.”
in
other
words,
i
think
that,
to
that
extent,
the
housing
authority
is,
and
perhaps
in
a
different
situation,
the
private
landlord,
although
i
wouldn't
be
adamant
in
saying
that
a
private
landlord
might
not
be
constitutionally
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
sir?
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
wilmington
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
that's
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
no,
sir.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
within
the
limits
of
their
annual
contributions
contracts,
they
do
have
that
right
and
privilege.
hud
itself
recognizes
this.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
i
say
it's
not.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
and,
the
reasons
for
that
are
these.
the
statute,
the
housing
--
united
states
housing
act
of
1937
did
provide
that
hud
could
issue
certain
general
rules
and
regulations
to
implement
the
chapter
--
the
provisions
of
the
chapter,
but
it
also
provided
in
there,
just
as
clear
as
it
could
be,
that
it
should
deal
with
housing
authority
stet
up
--
set
up
under
the
state
law,
as
this
one
was
under
the
state
statute,
by
entering
into
a
contract
with
them,
which
is
called
an
annual
contributions
contract.
it
wasn't
given
the
power
by
any
statute
to
run
the
housing
authority
setup
under
the
state
law
by
idict
or
by
rule
or
by
regulation,
absent
a
contract
with
that
agency,
that
hou
--
local
housing
authority.
had
to
have
a
contract,
annual
contributions
contract,
and
that's
in
their
general
power
to
make
rules
and
regulations
was
within
the
framework
of
the
concept
that
their
sole
control
over
this
local
housing
authority
was
by
virtue
of
the
contract
for
annual
contributions
that
it
entered
into.
and,
they
had
to
put
the
provisions
in
that
contract.
as
i
say
hud
recognizes
this.
the
petitioner,
in
preparing
this
case,
directed
certain
inquiries
to
her
with
reference
to
the
s
--
the
february
7,
1967
circular,
and
received
some
answers
from
hud
in
response
to
their
inquiry.
and,
you
will
find
those
in
the
petitioner's
brief
on
page
48
(a)
of
appendix
5.
back
in
the
back
part
of
the
brief
is
the
pertinent
one
that
i
would
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to.
there,
hud
says,
hud
policy
over
the
years
has
been
to
treat
the
local
housing
authorities
as
contracting
parties
under
the
annual
contributions
contract
not
covered
by
the
term
“public.”
material
issued
from
time
to
time
for
the
guidance
of
local
housing
authorities
in
the
implementation
of
the
annual
contributions
contract.
has,
therefore,
not
been
published
in
federal
registry,
but
local
authorities
are
given
actual
notice
of
these
matters
by
supplying
the
material,
manuals,
bulletins,
circulations,
and
similar
publications
directly
to
the
local
authorities.
and,
the
housing
act
didn't
require
that
there'd
be
inserted
in
the
annual
contributions
contract
any
controlling
features
about
eviction
or
what
sort
of
lease
should
given
to
the
tenants,
and
the
annual
contributions
contract
itself
contain
no
such
provisions.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
it
is
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
it
is
right
now.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
it
is,
yes,
sir.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
it
does
not
consider
to
be
retroactive
and
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
we
--
i
think,
as
a
matter
of
policy,
what
the
housing
authority
would
do
as
they're
now
doing
would
be
to
follow
the
procedures
set
out
in
the
hud.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
to
forget
about
the
conviction
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
i
think
that,
as
a
practical
matter,
the
--
unless
the
court
wants
to
establish
some
new
concept
and
make
some
pronouncements
as
to
constitutional
law
about
the
thing,
why,
that
won't
be
true.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
they
could.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
they
haven't
done
so,
that's
correct.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
i
do,
sir.
i
don't
think
that's
--
i
don't
that's
correct.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
not
necessarily,
the
--
i
think
that
the
annual
contributions
contract,
that
hud
rights
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
that
--
the
hud
rights,
the
annual
contributions
contract
and
the
authority
enters
into
that
contract
with
them.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
that
does,
unless
the
contract
provides
that
it
shall
be
--
that
certain
things
shall
be
done
pursuant
to
hud's,
from
time
to
time,
directive
and
advice.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
no,
sir.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
i
tell
you,
no,
sir,
because
i
think
that
what
they're
talking
about
are
those
areas
where
there
needs
to
be
some
rulemaking
and
there's,
for
example,
with
respect
to
keeping
the
records.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
that's
the
pha
requirements.
but
there,
again,
you
have
the
--
this
is
the
housing
manual
has
issued
and
the
contract
--
annual
contributions
contract
under
the
statute
is
the
connecting
link
between
the
two.
and,
we
say
that
this
hasn't
been
shown
to
be
anything
in
that
contract
which
is
the
only
--
really
the
only
link
between
this
housing
authority
setup
under
the
state
statute
and
hud
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
i
don't
think
it
would,
sir
but
necessarily
as
a
matter
of
law
and,
for
this
reason,
you
analyze
the
circular
itself.
the
first
paragraph
makes
an
announcement
of
fact
that
there's
been
a
lot
of
evictions
around
the
country
and
that
there's
public
dissatisfaction
about
it.
the
second
paragraph
says
we
--
that
is
hud,
we
believe
that
it's
essential
to
advice
with
the
tenant
before
the
eviction
action
is
taken.
then,
the
third
paragraph
says
that,
in
addition
to
advising
with
the
tenant,
from
this
date,
the
local
authority
shall
keep
certain
records.
and
now,
in
analyzing
what
they
meant
by
the
circular,
it
is
significant,
i
think,
that
hud
does
have
the
authority
under
the
annual
contributions
contract
and
under
the
statute
to
require
the
local
authority
to
keep
records,
and
the
only
directive
part,
the
mandatory
part,
of
this
circular
related
to
the
keeping
of
the
records
says,
from
time
--
from
this
date
forward,
you
shall
keep
certain
records.
now,
the
statute
set
forth
on
page
7
(a)
of
the
petitioner's
brief
set
out
that
the
--
that
hud
does
have
authority
to
require
the
local
authority
to
keep
records.
so,
when
they
wrote
this
circular,
they
gave
one
paragraph
of
information
about
what
was
going
on,
a
second
paragraph
about
what
they
believe
and
then
a
third
paragraph
which
directed
them
following
--
pursuant
to
their
authority
to
acquire
records
of
these
things.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
i
think
that's
correct.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
no,
sir.
certainly
would
not.
i
would
say
that
they
would
be
violating
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
probably
the
constitution
of
north
carolina
if
they
acted
in
such
a
fashion.
i
take
it
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
in
court,
i
think
he
would
be
entitled
to
inquire
into
the
matter,
and
that's
where
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
in
the
eviction
process.
that's
why,
at
one
point,
i
disagree
with
my
friend
on
the
effect
of
going
into
court
on
--
in
an
eviction
process
and
proceed.
i
think
constitutional
issues
are
relevant
there
and
can
be
raised
in
any
court
in
any
stage
of
the
proceeding
if
their
constitutional
issue,
requirements
of
the
constitution,
the
statute.
eviction
statue
couldn't
say
“you
cannot
raise
a
constitutional
issue
before
the
court.”
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
exactly
so,
and
so
you
have
to
consider
in
this
course,
it's
no
--
there's
no
question
about
it.
the
trial
judge
before
whom
the
matter
is
brought,
if
you
raise
and
say
that
“they're
violating
my
constitutional
rights
here,”
you'd
have
to
consider.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
and,
in
fact
--
excuse
me
sir.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
i'm
think
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
no,
sir.
we
don't
take
that
position.
we
take
the
position
that
the
constitutional
issues
would
be
relevant
as
they
were
ruled
on
here
in
this
very
case.
the
court
below,
when
she
raised
the
point
“my
first
amendment
rights
are
being
violated,”
the
court
didn't
say
“that
is
irrelevant.
you
will
not
be
heard
on
that."
the
court
heard
evidence
on
that
very
issue,
not
ruling
it
irrelevant
but
making
a
decision
and
making
a
finding
of
fact
based
on
competent
evidence
that
her
first
amendment
rights
had
not
been
violated.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
no,
sir.
they
haven't
--
they
did
not
hold
that
in
this
case
because
the
finding
was,
when
she
raised
the
issue
and
said
that
my
first
amendment
rights
had
been
violated,
the
court
did
not
deny
her
hearing
on
that
but,
instead,
held
a
hearing
on
it
and
permitted
evidence
to
be
introduced,
and
there
was
no
denial
of
any
request
by
the
petitioner
to
cross-examine
anyone,
no
denial
of
the
petitioner
of
her
right
to
introduce
any
evidence
that
she
saw
fit
on
this
or
any
other
issue.
there's
nothing
in
the
record
that
indicates
there
was
any
such
denial.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
that
is
our
difference,
yes,
sir.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
well,
we
did
give
notice.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
yes,
sir.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
that's
correct.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
the
--
on
page
8,
we
talk
about
the
adequacy
of
the
trial
below,
sir,
in
which
adequate
hearing
was
provided
in
the
trial
below,
if
that's
the
point
that
you
were
referring
to.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
yes,
sir.
we
say
that,
during
the
trial,
this
matter
in
the
superior
court,
defended
not
to
quarrel
with
the
nature
of
the
scope
of
the
judicial
inquiry.
that's
the
petition,
but
contended
only
that
due
process
required
the
housing
authority
to
give
the
tenant
notice
of
its
reason
and
a
hearing
before
it
instituted
that.
and,
we
do
go
on
and
we
say
that
we
do
not
contend
that
we
could
violate
this
petition
as
first
amendment
rights
in
--
as
a
condition
to
her
remaining
in
the
apartment,
that
we
couldn't
place
a
denial
of
some
constitutional
right
such
as
a
right
to
vote
or
any
other
rights,
free
speech,
as
a
condition
precedent
to
her
remaining
in
there.
and,
we
say
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
that's
correct,
and
we
concede
that
and
we
say
that
that
is
a
--
it
was
found
to
be
relevant
by
the
trial
court
and
passed
upon
by
the
trial
court
and
when
it
--
of
course,
when
it
was
here
before,
there
were
some
language
in
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
that
indicated
that
it
might
be
considering
it
irrelevant
that
such
an
issue
be
raised,
but
when
it
went
back
for
re-hearing,
the
court
reviewed
them
out
and
said,
in
effect,
that
the
trial
court
had
before
it
whether
her
first
amendment
rights
have
been
violated
and
so
on,
and
that
the
court
--
the
trial
court
decided
issue
on
competent
evidence
and
it
should
be
sustained.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
if
i
were
representing
the
tenants
or
if
i
were
a
judge
considering
the
matter,
i
would
say
they
would
have
a
valid
right
under
shelley
versus
kraemer
or
the
cases
of
that
sort
in
which
they
go
into
the
state
court
and
ask
the
court
to
enforce
something
such
as
a
trespass
criminal
case
or
an
eviction
proceeding
and
say
that
you
--
and
would
say
that
the
constitution
forbids
the
state
courts
from
taking
this
kind
of
governmental
action
to
implement
that
kind
of
denial
of
constitutions.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
certainly
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
it
would
certainly
be
arguable
and,
of
course,
the
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
and,
the
only
answer
i
can
give
is
that
some
of
these
--
most
of
the
cases
in
the
past
have
said
that
the
fact
that
it
is
a
governmental
agency
is
relevant
to
that
issue,
that
the
restrictions
of
the
constitution
were
framed
to
restrain
government
because
it
had
unusual
powers.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
that's
correct
and
the
--
but,
i'm
saying,
too,
that
in
the
shelley
versus
kraemer
situation
where
you
go
into
the
courts
and
just
say
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
right.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
i
think
you'd
have
to
answer
the
question
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
in
the
cross-examination.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
then
he
would've
answered
the
question.
if
he
had
said
“no
reason
at
all,”
we
just
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
i
think
that
the
housing
authority
would
succeed
that,
if
there
was
no
reason
at
all,
her
con
--
there
was
no
constitutional
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
that's
correct,
and
then
we're
saying
that,
as
the
matter
now
stands
and
has
in
the
past
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
the
bad
reasonings
are
the
constitutional
ones
and
we
can't
--
the
statute
doesn't
say
there
has
to
be
any
other
kind
of
reasons
and
we
don't
think
that
the
constitution
says
that
you
have
to
have
other
kind
of
reasons.
as
long
as
you
say
that
the
standard
is
applicable
in
this
little
housing
authority,
which
has
no
governmental
powers
other
than
that
given
to
ordinary
landlords
so
that
the
mandates
and
restrictions
of
the
constitutions
which
apply
to
government
generally
and
were
designed
to
restrict
government
generally,
wouldn't
necessarily
apply
because
they
have
to
go
into
eviction
proceedings
to
get
their
property
back,
they
have
to
sign
a
lease,
though
i
can
hear
the
landlord.
they
don't,
as
agency
of
government,
they've
not
a
single
power
that
an
ordinary
landlord
have
that
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
sir?
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
because
it's
handling
public
funds.
now,
when
i
say
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
that
is
one
point
but,
i
take
it,
the
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
i
was
--
my
position
was,
sir,
that
some
of
at
least
he
restrictions
of
the
constitution
between
this
--
between
an
individual
and
the
government,
they
were
designed
to
prevent
government
through
its
greater
thought,
its
greater
power,
and
so
forth,
from
imposing
on
the
individual.
therefore,
the
constitutional
prohibitions
against
government
taken
certain
actions,
vice
versa,
an
individual
which
--
that
wouldn't
make
that
--
that
reasoning
would
not
give
rise
to
any
constitutional
prohibitions
as
against
this
housing
authority
because
it
didn't
have
any
power
or
authority
greater
than
that,
but
when
it
comes
to
the
theory,
“well,
you're
administering
funds,
therefore,
a
morality
founded
on
constitutional
principles
needs
to
be
applied
to
you.”
example,
mr.
edwards,
if
a
private
housing
authority
could
say
that
“none
of
my
tenants
shall
be
permitted
to
speak
in
any
way
that
i
disliked,”
there's
nothing
wrong
with
that,
is
there?
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
i
just
--
there's
something
wrong
but,
i
think,
legally,
no,
there's
nothing
wrong
with
it.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
that
is
correct,
i'm
sure.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
that
is
involved
in
this
case
and
it
was
decided
in
this
case
because
of
the
prese
--
the
petitioner
presented
her
contention
of
what
right
was
being
violated,
the
court
listened
on
the
evidence
on
it
and
decided
against
the
petition.
that
is
this
case.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
yes,
that's
right.
that's
the
first
judgment
of
the
court
in
north
carolina.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
that
was
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
in
north
carolina,
what
you
just
read,
per
curiam
opinion
in
the
first
case.
see,
this
has
been
to
the
court
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
supreme
court
of
north
carolina
twice.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
that's
the
first
time.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
on
their
--
when
it
went
back
on
re-hearing,
they
considered
that
matter
and
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
on
re-hearing
--
it's
page
39
--
wait
a
minute.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
the
--
wherever
the
opinion
is
of
the
court,
i
believe
it's
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
find
it.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
the
court
on
re-hearing
said
this.
“she
refused
to
vacate,
charging
her
lease
was
being
vacated
because
of
her
having
been
elected
president
of
the
parent's
club.
no
evidence
was
offered
as
to
the
purposes
of
the
club,
nor
that
its
activities
conflicted
with
interest
to
their
authority.
the
manager
of
the
authority
stated
unequivocally,
under
oath,
that
the
termination
of
the
lease
had
no
connection
whatever
with
the
tenant's
activities
and
get
back
to
the
parents
club,
judge
picket
so
found.
that
was
the
trial
court.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
in
the
superior
court
judgment
which
--
in
this
appendix
here,
that
was
upon
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
no,
sir.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
the
language
that
you
just
read
was
one
of
the
findings
it
is
true.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
21,
finding
number
10
says
this
is
the
finding
of
the
court
below
that
the
plaintiff,
housing
authority
to
the
city
of
durham,
acting
through
c.s.
oldham,
its
manager
and
executive
director,
gave
notice
to
the
defendant
to
vacate
said
premises,
not
because
she
had
engaged
in
efforts
to
organize
the
tenants
of
mcdougald
terrace
nor
because
she
was
elected
president
of
a
group
organizing
mcdougald
terrace
on
august
10,
1965
that
these
were
not
the
reason
the
said
notice
was
given
and
eviction
undertaken.
that
was
the
finding
of
the
court.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
the
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
that,
of
course,
if
your
honor
please,
is
not
the
opinion
or
not
the
judgment
in
the
trial
court.
that
is
the
per
curiam
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina
as
it
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
as
it
appeared
when
the
case
was
first
heard
in
that
supreme
court,
but
what
i'm
saying
is
that
when
it
went
back
to
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina,
they
added
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
on
your
remand,
yes,
sir.
they
said
a
different
--
or
not
necessarily
a
different
thing,
but
they
amplified
what
their
meaning
was.
i
--
when
we're
here
before,
my
contention
was
that
this
language
in
this
per
curiam
decision,
not
only
that
it
was
immaterial,
under
the
showing
in
the
evidence
that
was
presented
there,
what
their
reason
might
have
been
because
there
was
no
showing
of
any
constitutional
violation
by
the
petitioner.
for
that
reason,
it
became
immaterial
but
there
was
no
holding
even
then
that
she
could
not
have
the
opportunity
to
show
that
any
constitutional
right
was
violated.
then,
when
it
went
back
to
the
supreme
court
of
carolina
on
re-hearing,
the
court
went
further
into
that
particular
point
of
the
finding
--
on
the
finding
that
her
first
amendment
rights
had
not
been
violated
by
the
trial
court
and
then
said
that
since
they
were
based
on
competent
evidence,
those
findings
by
the
trial
judge
which
appear
in
finding
number
10
should
be
sustained.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
that
the
--
that
no
constitutional
issue
was
raised
in
that
case.
they
just
gave
them
notice
and
the
--
it
was
a
normal
eviction
proceeding.
no
governmental
agency
was
involved
in
that
case.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
well,
i
don't
think
that
when
they
say
it's
immaterial
in
that
first
per
curiam
decision,
they
are
really
staking
out
what
the
court's
view
of
the
matter
was.
this
was
not
the
trial
court.
it'd
be
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina
per
curiam
decision
in
one
summons
says
that,
“under
the
findings
that
have
come
to
us.”
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
well,
i'm
saying
just
what
it
means.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
all
it
says
is
that
it's
immaterial,
but
i
think
that
you
have
to
construe
what
they're
talking
about
in
terms
of
the
case
that
was
then
before,
which
was
a
case
that
had
come
before
them
with
a
finding
of
fact
by
the
trial
judge
that
first
amendment
rights
had
not
been
violated
and
that
there'd
been
no
request
by
the
petitioner
for
further
exploration
by
the
trial
court
into
any
reasons
and
there'd
been
no
objection
or
exception
taken
to
any
action
by
the
trial
court,
vice
versa,
any
further
exploration
or
what
the
reasons
might
have
been.
and,
in
that
context,
i
take
it
that,
on
appeal
to
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina,
it
really
was
immaterial
what
the
reasons
were.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
they
didn't
take
exceptions
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
the
exceptions
are
on
page
25,
i
think,
of
the
appendix,
grouping
of
exceptions
and
assignments
of
error.
and,
what
i'm
saying
is
that
there
were
no
exceptions
taken
to
the
scope
of
the
trial
court's
inquiry
and
the
reasons
because
there
was
no
request
made
upon
the
trial
court
to
broaden
the
scope
of
its
inquiry.
therefore,
there
would
--
could
be
no
exception
taken
to
the
trial
court
just
confining
itself
to
the
evidence
presented
by
the
petitioner.
and,
her
contentions,
she
said
they
were
in
the
trial.
there
was
no
request
to
the
judge
and
the
trial
of
the
action
say
“make
them
come
in
and
give
us
additional
reasons.”
they
didn't
ask
that,
and
the
fact
that
he
didn't
do
it
on
his
own
motion
was
not
accepted,
too,
either
there.
when
it
went
from
the
trial
court
to
the
supreme
court,
they
didn't
take
exceptions
to
the
failure
of
the
trial
court
on
its
own
motion
to
make
further
inquiry
and
broaden
the
scope
of
its
inquiry
and
the
reasons
for
the
eviction.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
i
think
this
language
at
least
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
is
an
error.
if
that
language
is
literal
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
that
is
correct,
but
i
think
that
what
you're
confronted
with
here
is,
you
have
the
same
thing,
as
far
as
evidence
and
findings
are
concerned,
is
that
before
the
supreme
court
of
carolina
and
you
say
that,
on
the
basis
of
those
findings
and
on
that
evidence,
she
had
a
fair
trial
in
the
trial
court
there.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
if
it's
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
if
it's
in
terms
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
it
would
be
within
the
context
of
the
generally
applicable
rules.
i
think
this
court
has
applied
to
other
situations
in
which
you
have
a
procedural
rule
that
has
entered
into
the
picture
between
the
trial
and
the
final
determination
you
apply
whatever.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
we
just
lost
the
lawsuit,
i
gather.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
i
don't
think
it's
binding.
i
think
it's
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
i
think
you
have
here
a
contractual
situation.
you
have
a
state
agency
to
be
sure,
but
it's
not
a
federal
agency.
the
local
housing
authority
is
created
under
a
state
statute,
and
hud
doesn't
have
a
vestige
of
authority
over
it
granted
by
any
statute
except
by
virtue
of
entering
into
an
annual
contributions
contract
with
it
and
the
sign
on
the
dotted
line,
hud
and
the
local
authority.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
i
think
so.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
that's
correct.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
i
think
so.
i
think
that
because
you'd
have
to
be
very
careful
about
reviewing
the
content
of
the
annual
contributions
contract,
which
we
have
done
and
can
find
nothing
in
it
that
gives
hud
the
prerogative
under
the
terms
of
that
contract
to
say
what
kind
of
lease
we're
going
to
have,
whether
it
should
be
for
six
months,
one
month,
one
year,
or
anything
like
that
and
it
doesn't
give
them
any
prerogative
to
say
that
you
must
have
an
administrative
hearing
in
advance
of
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
that's
correct.
it's
whether
the
constitution
of
this
country
requires
that
there'd
be
an
administrative
hearing
or
administrative
giving
of
reasons
before
the
eviction
proceedings
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
before
we
go
to
court.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
i
would
say
that
would
not
be
a
sufficient
defense
on
the
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
that's
right.
i
cannot
be
evicted
because
i
received
no
reason.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
i
think
she
would've
been
entitled
to
do
so.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
i
think
she
could.
i
think
she
could
insist
upon
her
right
to
examine
the
agen
--
the
executive
director
of
the
authority.
if
he
got
up
on
the
stand
and
ask
“what
reason
did
you
have?”
he
might
say
“i
had
no
reason
at
all,
i
just
wanted
a
vacant
apartment
there,”
but
we
say,
constitutionally,
he
would
be
entitled
--
that
would
be
a
constitutionally
acceptable
answer
and
said
“i
had
no
reason
at
all,
i
just
wanted
a
vacant
apartment.”
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
that
was
the
first
--
the
first
opinion
was
overbroad
and
i
concede
that
it
was,
and
i
don't
think
that
the
language
accurately
portrayed
what
the
court
was
thinking
and
what
it
was
holding.
i
know
it
didn't
portray
what
it
was
actually
holding
on
the
basis
of
the
record
before
it.
and
then,
when
it
went
back
on
re-hearing,
i
think
it
clarified
that
point.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
yes.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
yes,
sir.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
in
the
courts.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
she
never
--
she
has
never
asked
in
the
trial
court,
if
your
honor
please,
what
the
reasons
were.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
no,
sir.
she
did
not
ask
in
the
trial
of
this
action.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
they
should
--
there
was
no
evidence,
of
course,
in
the
supreme
court,
but
when
an
opportunity
during
the
trial
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
but
when
the
action
was
tried,
when
the
matter
was
before
the
trial
court
on
finding
the
issues,
the
trial
court
found
on
her
and
she
contended
that
her
first
amendment
right
had
been
violated.
evidence
was
introduced
on
that
point.
the
court
found
against
her.
there
was
no
additional
question
asked
about
what
the
reasons
were
in
that
trial
of
that
action.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
there
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
discover
procee
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
superior
court.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
there
are
indeed.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
she
could've
had
pre-trial
discovery
by
interrogatories,
written
interrogatories
or
by
pre-trial
examinations
of
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
sorry?
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
it
starts
before
the
justice
of
the
peace.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
it's
de
novo.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
completely
de
novo.
it's
just
like
starting
all
over
again.
she
filed
in
lieu
of
pleadings
and
affidavits
setting
out
what
her
contentions
were
about
why
she
was
being
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
pre-trial
discovery,
yes.
but,
in
an
eviction
proceeding,
the
normal
course
is
before
a
justice
and
then
it
goes
to
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
you
can't.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
until
she
appeals
from
the
justice
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
and
then
she
gets
into
it,
but
it's
de
novo,
completely
new
in
the
superior
court
and,
before
you
get
to
that
stage,
she
does
have
the
discovery
proceedings
available.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
right.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
that's
correct.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
that's
right.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
they
could've
had
him
there
and
they
could've
cross-examined
him
and
ask
him
any
number
of
questions,
at
least
as
far
as
this
record
is
concerned
they
could've,
because
there
was
no
question
that
they
asked
that
was
denied
by
the
court,
there's
no
ruling
of
irrelevancy
anywhere
along
the
line
by
the
trial
court,
and
they
made
no
exception.
they
didn't
ask
the
trial
court,
“now,
will
you
expand
this
hearing
in
this
trial
court
to
require
into
other
reasons
that
might
have
existed?”
they
didn't
ask
that.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
no,
sir.
the
trial
court
did
not.
it
was
never
said
in
the
trial
court
that
it
was
immaterial
at
any
stage
because
the
question
was
never
asked
in
the
trial
court,
never.
it
was
only
the
language,
that
your
honor
was
referring
to,
appears
for
the
first
time
in
the
per
curiam
deci
--
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina.
that's
the
only
place
that
that
sentence
has
ever
appeared
in
this
whole
lawsuit,
from
the
beginning
to
the
end.
that's
the
one
place
it's
appeared.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
it
has
created
a
confusion,
yes,
sir.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
mr.
chief
justice
and,
if
the
court
please.
if
--
as
mr.
justice
fortas
has
suggested,
we're
at
the
threshold
here
of
developing
some
new
constitutional
concept
about
the
relationship
of
the
poor
with
the
government.
i
don't
know
whether
i
can
supply
much
thought
that's
worthwhile,
except
this,
that
the
philosophy
that
has
been
developed
in
the
brief
for
the
petitioner
here,
at
least
by
quoting
certain
individuals
such
as
professor
jones
and
professor
rich
on
the
subject,
on
page
36
and
37
of
the
brief
seems
to
have
followed
the
line
of
thought
that
what
we're
doing
is
to
give
the
poor
the
same
rights
and
their
contact
with
government
that
is
possessed
by
other
people,
that
is,
we
equate
the
thing.
and,
that
we
haven't
arrived
yet
in
any
case
that
i
know
of
where
they
are
given
some
different
rights.
now,
when
you
supply
them
with
a
lawyer,
because
they're
poor
and
can't
afford
one,
you're
not
giving
them
additional
rights
in
a
sense.
all
you're
doing
is
equating
them
with
a
fellow
who
can
afford
a
lawyer.
in
this
case,
you
have
a
lease
that
is
a
standard
procedure
between
landlord
and
tenant.
now,
the
question
arises,
do
the
common
law
procedures,
these
common
law
concepts,
common
law
or
the
statutory
laws
that
are
applicable
to
everybody
in
a
landlord
and
tenant
relationship,
do
not
they
supply
reasonable
standards
of
fairness?
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
and,
i'm
sure
that
it
does
not
because
they
are
placed
on
an
equal
basis
here.
now,
the
only
question
then
is
whether
he
wants
to
go
further
than
that,
and
i
say
not.
that
perhaps
that
is
a
matter
that
the
congress
should
consider
as
to
whether
or
not
they
want
to
make
the
relationship
different
and
or
the
state
legislature.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
the
heard
circular
is
the
thing
that
i
would
like
to
take
up
next
then,
if
i
may.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
yes.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
there
are
differences.
i
don't
know.
for
one,
the
difference
would
be
that
i
assume
that
a
housing
authority
could
not
say
“we
will
require
you
to
sign
a
statement
that
you
never
belong
to
certain
organizations
found
by
the
attorney
general
to
be
subversive
that
has
a
condition
to
occupy
these
apartments.”
you
can't
do
that,
or
you
can't
say
that
“you
can't
occupy
these
apartments
if
you
decide
to
vote
or,
if
you
decide
to
make
a
speech
somewhere,
you
can't
occupy.”
in
other
words,
i
think
that,
to
that
extent,
the
housing
authority
is,
and
perhaps
in
a
different
situation,
the
private
landlord,
although
i
wouldn't
be
adamant
in
saying
that
a
private
landlord
might
not
be
constitutionally
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
sir?
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
wilmington
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
that's
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
no,
sir.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
within
the
limits
of
their
annual
contributions
contracts,
they
do
have
that
right
and
privilege.
hud
itself
recognizes
this.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
i
say
it's
not.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
and,
the
reasons
for
that
are
these.
the
statute,
the
housing
--
united
states
housing
act
of
1937
did
provide
that
hud
could
issue
certain
general
rules
and
regulations
to
implement
the
chapter
--
the
provisions
of
the
chapter,
but
it
also
provided
in
there,
just
as
clear
as
it
could
be,
that
it
should
deal
with
housing
authority
stet
up
--
set
up
under
the
state
law,
as
this
one
was
under
the
state
statute,
by
entering
into
a
contract
with
them,
which
is
called
an
annual
contributions
contract.
it
wasn't
given
the
power
by
any
statute
to
run
the
housing
authority
setup
under
the
state
law
by
idict
or
by
rule
or
by
regulation,
absent
a
contract
with
that
agency,
that
hou
--
local
housing
authority.
had
to
have
a
contract,
annual
contributions
contract,
and
that's
in
their
general
power
to
make
rules
and
regulations
was
within
the
framework
of
the
concept
that
their
sole
control
over
this
local
housing
authority
was
by
virtue
of
the
contract
for
annual
contributions
that
it
entered
into.
and,
they
had
to
put
the
provisions
in
that
contract.
as
i
say
hud
recognizes
this.
the
petitioner,
in
preparing
this
case,
directed
certain
inquiries
to
her
with
reference
to
the
s
--
the
february
7,
1967
circular,
and
received
some
answers
from
hud
in
response
to
their
inquiry.
and,
you
will
find
those
in
the
petitioner's
brief
on
page
48
(a)
of
appendix
5.
back
in
the
back
part
of
the
brief
is
the
pertinent
one
that
i
would
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to.
there,
hud
says,
hud
policy
over
the
years
has
been
to
treat
the
local
housing
authorities
as
contracting
parties
under
the
annual
contributions
contract
not
covered
by
the
term
“public.”
material
issued
from
time
to
time
for
the
guidance
of
local
housing
authorities
in
the
implementation
of
the
annual
contributions
contract.
has,
therefore,
not
been
published
in
federal
registry,
but
local
authorities
are
given
actual
notice
of
these
matters
by
supplying
the
material,
manuals,
bulletins,
circulations,
and
similar
publications
directly
to
the
local
authorities.
and,
the
housing
act
didn't
require
that
there'd
be
inserted
in
the
annual
contributions
contract
any
controlling
features
about
eviction
or
what
sort
of
lease
should
given
to
the
tenants,
and
the
annual
contributions
contract
itself
contain
no
such
provisions.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
it
is
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
it
is
right
now.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
it
is,
yes,
sir.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
it
does
not
consider
to
be
retroactive
and
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
we
--
i
think,
as
a
matter
of
policy,
what
the
housing
authority
would
do
as
they're
now
doing
would
be
to
follow
the
procedures
set
out
in
the
hud.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
to
forget
about
the
conviction
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
i
think
that,
as
a
practical
matter,
the
--
unless
the
court
wants
to
establish
some
new
concept
and
make
some
pronouncements
as
to
constitutional
law
about
the
thing,
why,
that
won't
be
true.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
they
could.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
they
haven't
done
so,
that's
correct.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
i
do,
sir.
i
don't
think
that's
--
i
don't
that's
correct.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
not
necessarily,
the
--
i
think
that
the
annual
contributions
contract,
that
hud
rights
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
that
--
the
hud
rights,
the
annual
contributions
contract
and
the
authority
enters
into
that
contract
with
them.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
that
does,
unless
the
contract
provides
that
it
shall
be
--
that
certain
things
shall
be
done
pursuant
to
hud's,
from
time
to
time,
directive
and
advice.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
no,
sir.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
i
tell
you,
no,
sir,
because
i
think
that
what
they're
talking
about
are
those
areas
where
there
needs
to
be
some
rulemaking
and
there's,
for
example,
with
respect
to
keeping
the
records.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
that's
the
pha
requirements.
but
there,
again,
you
have
the
--
this
is
the
housing
manual
has
issued
and
the
contract
--
annual
contributions
contract
under
the
statute
is
the
connecting
link
between
the
two.
and,
we
say
that
this
hasn't
been
shown
to
be
anything
in
that
contract
which
is
the
only
--
really
the
only
link
between
this
housing
authority
setup
under
the
state
statute
and
hud
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
i
don't
think
it
would,
sir
but
necessarily
as
a
matter
of
law
and,
for
this
reason,
you
analyze
the
circular
itself.
the
first
paragraph
makes
an
announcement
of
fact
that
there's
been
a
lot
of
evictions
around
the
country
and
that
there's
public
dissatisfaction
about
it.
the
second
paragraph
says
we
--
that
is
hud,
we
believe
that
it's
essential
to
advice
with
the
tenant
before
the
eviction
action
is
taken.
then,
the
third
paragraph
says
that,
in
addition
to
advising
with
the
tenant,
from
this
date,
the
local
authority
shall
keep
certain
records.
and
now,
in
analyzing
what
they
meant
by
the
circular,
it
is
significant,
i
think,
that
hud
does
have
the
authority
under
the
annual
contributions
contract
and
under
the
statute
to
require
the
local
authority
to
keep
records,
and
the
only
directive
part,
the
mandatory
part,
of
this
circular
related
to
the
keeping
of
the
records
says,
from
time
--
from
this
date
forward,
you
shall
keep
certain
records.
now,
the
statute
set
forth
on
page
7
(a)
of
the
petitioner's
brief
set
out
that
the
--
that
hud
does
have
authority
to
require
the
local
authority
to
keep
records.
so,
when
they
wrote
this
circular,
they
gave
one
paragraph
of
information
about
what
was
going
on,
a
second
paragraph
about
what
they
believe
and
then
a
third
paragraph
which
directed
them
following
--
pursuant
to
their
authority
to
acquire
records
of
these
things.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
i
think
that's
correct.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
no,
sir.
certainly
would
not.
i
would
say
that
they
would
be
violating
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
probably
the
constitution
of
north
carolina
if
they
acted
in
such
a
fashion.
i
take
it
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
in
court,
i
think
he
would
be
entitled
to
inquire
into
the
matter,
and
that's
where
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
in
the
eviction
process.
that's
why,
at
one
point,
i
disagree
with
my
friend
on
the
effect
of
going
into
court
on
--
in
an
eviction
process
and
proceed.
i
think
constitutional
issues
are
relevant
there
and
can
be
raised
in
any
court
in
any
stage
of
the
proceeding
if
their
constitutional
issue,
requirements
of
the
constitution,
the
statute.
eviction
statue
couldn't
say
“you
cannot
raise
a
constitutional
issue
before
the
court.”
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
exactly
so,
and
so
you
have
to
consider
in
this
course,
it's
no
--
there's
no
question
about
it.
the
trial
judge
before
whom
the
matter
is
brought,
if
you
raise
and
say
that
“they're
violating
my
constitutional
rights
here,”
you'd
have
to
consider.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
and,
in
fact
--
excuse
me
sir.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
i'm
think
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
no,
sir.
we
don't
take
that
position.
we
take
the
position
that
the
constitutional
issues
would
be
relevant
as
they
were
ruled
on
here
in
this
very
case.
the
court
below,
when
she
raised
the
point
“my
first
amendment
rights
are
being
violated,”
the
court
didn't
say
“that
is
irrelevant.
you
will
not
be
heard
on
that."
the
court
heard
evidence
on
that
very
issue,
not
ruling
it
irrelevant
but
making
a
decision
and
making
a
finding
of
fact
based
on
competent
evidence
that
her
first
amendment
rights
had
not
been
violated.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
no,
sir.
they
haven't
--
they
did
not
hold
that
in
this
case
because
the
finding
was,
when
she
raised
the
issue
and
said
that
my
first
amendment
rights
had
been
violated,
the
court
did
not
deny
her
hearing
on
that
but,
instead,
held
a
hearing
on
it
and
permitted
evidence
to
be
introduced,
and
there
was
no
denial
of
any
request
by
the
petitioner
to
cross-examine
anyone,
no
denial
of
the
petitioner
of
her
right
to
introduce
any
evidence
that
she
saw
fit
on
this
or
any
other
issue.
there's
nothing
in
the
record
that
indicates
there
was
any
such
denial.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
that
is
our
difference,
yes,
sir.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
well,
we
did
give
notice.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
yes,
sir.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
that's
correct.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
the
--
on
page
8,
we
talk
about
the
adequacy
of
the
trial
below,
sir,
in
which
adequate
hearing
was
provided
in
the
trial
below,
if
that's
the
point
that
you
were
referring
to.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
yes,
sir.
we
say
that,
during
the
trial,
this
matter
in
the
superior
court,
defended
not
to
quarrel
with
the
nature
of
the
scope
of
the
judicial
inquiry.
that's
the
petition,
but
contended
only
that
due
process
required
the
housing
authority
to
give
the
tenant
notice
of
its
reason
and
a
hearing
before
it
instituted
that.
and,
we
do
go
on
and
we
say
that
we
do
not
contend
that
we
could
violate
this
petition
as
first
amendment
rights
in
--
as
a
condition
to
her
remaining
in
the
apartment,
that
we
couldn't
place
a
denial
of
some
constitutional
right
such
as
a
right
to
vote
or
any
other
rights,
free
speech,
as
a
condition
precedent
to
her
remaining
in
there.
and,
we
say
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
that's
correct,
and
we
concede
that
and
we
say
that
that
is
a
--
it
was
found
to
be
relevant
by
the
trial
court
and
passed
upon
by
the
trial
court
and
when
it
--
of
course,
when
it
was
here
before,
there
were
some
language
in
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
that
indicated
that
it
might
be
considering
it
irrelevant
that
such
an
issue
be
raised,
but
when
it
went
back
for
re-hearing,
the
court
reviewed
them
out
and
said,
in
effect,
that
the
trial
court
had
before
it
whether
her
first
amendment
rights
have
been
violated
and
so
on,
and
that
the
court
--
the
trial
court
decided
issue
on
competent
evidence
and
it
should
be
sustained.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
if
i
were
representing
the
tenants
or
if
i
were
a
judge
considering
the
matter,
i
would
say
they
would
have
a
valid
right
under
shelley
versus
kraemer
or
the
cases
of
that
sort
in
which
they
go
into
the
state
court
and
ask
the
court
to
enforce
something
such
as
a
trespass
criminal
case
or
an
eviction
proceeding
and
say
that
you
--
and
would
say
that
the
constitution
forbids
the
state
courts
from
taking
this
kind
of
governmental
action
to
implement
that
kind
of
denial
of
constitutions.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
certainly
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
it
would
certainly
be
arguable
and,
of
course,
the
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
and,
the
only
answer
i
can
give
is
that
some
of
these
--
most
of
the
cases
in
the
past
have
said
that
the
fact
that
it
is
a
governmental
agency
is
relevant
to
that
issue,
that
the
restrictions
of
the
constitution
were
framed
to
restrain
government
because
it
had
unusual
powers.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
that's
correct
and
the
--
but,
i'm
saying,
too,
that
in
the
shelley
versus
kraemer
situation
where
you
go
into
the
courts
and
just
say
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
right.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
i
think
you'd
have
to
answer
the
question
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
in
the
cross-examination.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
then
he
would've
answered
the
question.
if
he
had
said
“no
reason
at
all,”
we
just
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
i
think
that
the
housing
authority
would
succeed
that,
if
there
was
no
reason
at
all,
her
con
--
there
was
no
constitutional
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
that's
correct,
and
then
we're
saying
that,
as
the
matter
now
stands
and
has
in
the
past
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
the
bad
reasonings
are
the
constitutional
ones
and
we
can't
--
the
statute
doesn't
say
there
has
to
be
any
other
kind
of
reasons
and
we
don't
think
that
the
constitution
says
that
you
have
to
have
other
kind
of
reasons.
as
long
as
you
say
that
the
standard
is
applicable
in
this
little
housing
authority,
which
has
no
governmental
powers
other
than
that
given
to
ordinary
landlords
so
that
the
mandates
and
restrictions
of
the
constitutions
which
apply
to
government
generally
and
were
designed
to
restrict
government
generally,
wouldn't
necessarily
apply
because
they
have
to
go
into
eviction
proceedings
to
get
their
property
back,
they
have
to
sign
a
lease,
though
i
can
hear
the
landlord.
they
don't,
as
agency
of
government,
they've
not
a
single
power
that
an
ordinary
landlord
have
that
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
sir?
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
because
it's
handling
public
funds.
now,
when
i
say
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
that
is
one
point
but,
i
take
it,
the
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
i
was
--
my
position
was,
sir,
that
some
of
at
least
he
restrictions
of
the
constitution
between
this
--
between
an
individual
and
the
government,
they
were
designed
to
prevent
government
through
its
greater
thought,
its
greater
power,
and
so
forth,
from
imposing
on
the
individual.
therefore,
the
constitutional
prohibitions
against
government
taken
certain
actions,
vice
versa,
an
individual
which
--
that
wouldn't
make
that
--
that
reasoning
would
not
give
rise
to
any
constitutional
prohibitions
as
against
this
housing
authority
because
it
didn't
have
any
power
or
authority
greater
than
that,
but
when
it
comes
to
the
theory,
“well,
you're
administering
funds,
therefore,
a
morality
founded
on
constitutional
principles
needs
to
be
applied
to
you.”
example,
mr.
edwards,
if
a
private
housing
authority
could
say
that
“none
of
my
tenants
shall
be
permitted
to
speak
in
any
way
that
i
disliked,”
there's
nothing
wrong
with
that,
is
there?
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
i
just
--
there's
something
wrong
but,
i
think,
legally,
no,
there's
nothing
wrong
with
it.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
that
is
correct,
i'm
sure.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
that
is
involved
in
this
case
and
it
was
decided
in
this
case
because
of
the
prese
--
the
petitioner
presented
her
contention
of
what
right
was
being
violated,
the
court
listened
on
the
evidence
on
it
and
decided
against
the
petition.
that
is
this
case.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
yes,
that's
right.
that's
the
first
judgment
of
the
court
in
north
carolina.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
that
was
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
in
north
carolina,
what
you
just
read,
per
curiam
opinion
in
the
first
case.
see,
this
has
been
to
the
court
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
supreme
court
of
north
carolina
twice.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
that's
the
first
time.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
on
their
--
when
it
went
back
on
re-hearing,
they
considered
that
matter
and
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
on
re-hearing
--
it's
page
39
--
wait
a
minute.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
the
--
wherever
the
opinion
is
of
the
court,
i
believe
it's
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
find
it.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
the
court
on
re-hearing
said
this.
“she
refused
to
vacate,
charging
her
lease
was
being
vacated
because
of
her
having
been
elected
president
of
the
parent's
club.
no
evidence
was
offered
as
to
the
purposes
of
the
club,
nor
that
its
activities
conflicted
with
interest
to
their
authority.
the
manager
of
the
authority
stated
unequivocally,
under
oath,
that
the
termination
of
the
lease
had
no
connection
whatever
with
the
tenant's
activities
and
get
back
to
the
parents
club,
judge
picket
so
found.
that
was
the
trial
court.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
in
the
superior
court
judgment
which
--
in
this
appendix
here,
that
was
upon
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
no,
sir.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
the
language
that
you
just
read
was
one
of
the
findings
it
is
true.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
21,
finding
number
10
says
this
is
the
finding
of
the
court
below
that
the
plaintiff,
housing
authority
to
the
city
of
durham,
acting
through
c.s.
oldham,
its
manager
and
executive
director,
gave
notice
to
the
defendant
to
vacate
said
premises,
not
because
she
had
engaged
in
efforts
to
organize
the
tenants
of
mcdougald
terrace
nor
because
she
was
elected
president
of
a
group
organizing
mcdougald
terrace
on
august
10,
1965
that
these
were
not
the
reason
the
said
notice
was
given
and
eviction
undertaken.
that
was
the
finding
of
the
court.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
the
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
that,
of
course,
if
your
honor
please,
is
not
the
opinion
or
not
the
judgment
in
the
trial
court.
that
is
the
per
curiam
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina
as
it
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
as
it
appeared
when
the
case
was
first
heard
in
that
supreme
court,
but
what
i'm
saying
is
that
when
it
went
back
to
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina,
they
added
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
on
your
remand,
yes,
sir.
they
said
a
different
--
or
not
necessarily
a
different
thing,
but
they
amplified
what
their
meaning
was.
i
--
when
we're
here
before,
my
contention
was
that
this
language
in
this
per
curiam
decision,
not
only
that
it
was
immaterial,
under
the
showing
in
the
evidence
that
was
presented
there,
what
their
reason
might
have
been
because
there
was
no
showing
of
any
constitutional
violation
by
the
petitioner.
for
that
reason,
it
became
immaterial
but
there
was
no
holding
even
then
that
she
could
not
have
the
opportunity
to
show
that
any
constitutional
right
was
violated.
then,
when
it
went
back
to
the
supreme
court
of
carolina
on
re-hearing,
the
court
went
further
into
that
particular
point
of
the
finding
--
on
the
finding
that
her
first
amendment
rights
had
not
been
violated
by
the
trial
court
and
then
said
that
since
they
were
based
on
competent
evidence,
those
findings
by
the
trial
judge
which
appear
in
finding
number
10
should
be
sustained.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
that
the
--
that
no
constitutional
issue
was
raised
in
that
case.
they
just
gave
them
notice
and
the
--
it
was
a
normal
eviction
proceeding.
no
governmental
agency
was
involved
in
that
case.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
well,
i
don't
think
that
when
they
say
it's
immaterial
in
that
first
per
curiam
decision,
they
are
really
staking
out
what
the
court's
view
of
the
matter
was.
this
was
not
the
trial
court.
it'd
be
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina
per
curiam
decision
in
one
summons
says
that,
“under
the
findings
that
have
come
to
us.”
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
well,
i'm
saying
just
what
it
means.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
all
it
says
is
that
it's
immaterial,
but
i
think
that
you
have
to
construe
what
they're
talking
about
in
terms
of
the
case
that
was
then
before,
which
was
a
case
that
had
come
before
them
with
a
finding
of
fact
by
the
trial
judge
that
first
amendment
rights
had
not
been
violated
and
that
there'd
been
no
request
by
the
petitioner
for
further
exploration
by
the
trial
court
into
any
reasons
and
there'd
been
no
objection
or
exception
taken
to
any
action
by
the
trial
court,
vice
versa,
any
further
exploration
or
what
the
reasons
might
have
been.
and,
in
that
context,
i
take
it
that,
on
appeal
to
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina,
it
really
was
immaterial
what
the
reasons
were.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
they
didn't
take
exceptions
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
the
exceptions
are
on
page
25,
i
think,
of
the
appendix,
grouping
of
exceptions
and
assignments
of
error.
and,
what
i'm
saying
is
that
there
were
no
exceptions
taken
to
the
scope
of
the
trial
court's
inquiry
and
the
reasons
because
there
was
no
request
made
upon
the
trial
court
to
broaden
the
scope
of
its
inquiry.
therefore,
there
would
--
could
be
no
exception
taken
to
the
trial
court
just
confining
itself
to
the
evidence
presented
by
the
petitioner.
and,
her
contentions,
she
said
they
were
in
the
trial.
there
was
no
request
to
the
judge
and
the
trial
of
the
action
say
“make
them
come
in
and
give
us
additional
reasons.”
they
didn't
ask
that,
and
the
fact
that
he
didn't
do
it
on
his
own
motion
was
not
accepted,
too,
either
there.
when
it
went
from
the
trial
court
to
the
supreme
court,
they
didn't
take
exceptions
to
the
failure
of
the
trial
court
on
its
own
motion
to
make
further
inquiry
and
broaden
the
scope
of
its
inquiry
and
the
reasons
for
the
eviction.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
i
think
this
language
at
least
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
is
an
error.
if
that
language
is
literal
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
that
is
correct,
but
i
think
that
what
you're
confronted
with
here
is,
you
have
the
same
thing,
as
far
as
evidence
and
findings
are
concerned,
is
that
before
the
supreme
court
of
carolina
and
you
say
that,
on
the
basis
of
those
findings
and
on
that
evidence,
she
had
a
fair
trial
in
the
trial
court
there.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
if
it's
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
if
it's
in
terms
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
it
would
be
within
the
context
of
the
generally
applicable
rules.
i
think
this
court
has
applied
to
other
situations
in
which
you
have
a
procedural
rule
that
has
entered
into
the
picture
between
the
trial
and
the
final
determination
you
apply
whatever.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
we
just
lost
the
lawsuit,
i
gather.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
i
don't
think
it's
binding.
i
think
it's
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
i
think
you
have
here
a
contractual
situation.
you
have
a
state
agency
to
be
sure,
but
it's
not
a
federal
agency.
the
local
housing
authority
is
created
under
a
state
statute,
and
hud
doesn't
have
a
vestige
of
authority
over
it
granted
by
any
statute
except
by
virtue
of
entering
into
an
annual
contributions
contract
with
it
and
the
sign
on
the
dotted
line,
hud
and
the
local
authority.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
i
think
so.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
that's
correct.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
i
think
so.
i
think
that
because
you'd
have
to
be
very
careful
about
reviewing
the
content
of
the
annual
contributions
contract,
which
we
have
done
and
can
find
nothing
in
it
that
gives
hud
the
prerogative
under
the
terms
of
that
contract
to
say
what
kind
of
lease
we're
going
to
have,
whether
it
should
be
for
six
months,
one
month,
one
year,
or
anything
like
that
and
it
doesn't
give
them
any
prerogative
to
say
that
you
must
have
an
administrative
hearing
in
advance
of
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
that's
correct.
it's
whether
the
constitution
of
this
country
requires
that
there'd
be
an
administrative
hearing
or
administrative
giving
of
reasons
before
the
eviction
proceedings
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
before
we
go
to
court.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
i
would
say
that
would
not
be
a
sufficient
defense
on
the
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
that's
right.
i
cannot
be
evicted
because
i
received
no
reason.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
i
think
she
would've
been
entitled
to
do
so.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
i
think
she
could.
i
think
she
could
insist
upon
her
right
to
examine
the
agen
--
the
executive
director
of
the
authority.
if
he
got
up
on
the
stand
and
ask
“what
reason
did
you
have?”
he
might
say
“i
had
no
reason
at
all,
i
just
wanted
a
vacant
apartment
there,”
but
we
say,
constitutionally,
he
would
be
entitled
--
that
would
be
a
constitutionally
acceptable
answer
and
said
“i
had
no
reason
at
all,
i
just
wanted
a
vacant
apartment.”
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
that
was
the
first
--
the
first
opinion
was
overbroad
and
i
concede
that
it
was,
and
i
don't
think
that
the
language
accurately
portrayed
what
the
court
was
thinking
and
what
it
was
holding.
i
know
it
didn't
portray
what
it
was
actually
holding
on
the
basis
of
the
record
before
it.
and
then,
when
it
went
back
on
re-hearing,
i
think
it
clarified
that
point.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
yes.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
yes,
sir.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
in
the
courts.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
she
never
--
she
has
never
asked
in
the
trial
court,
if
your
honor
please,
what
the
reasons
were.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
no,
sir.
she
did
not
ask
in
the
trial
of
this
action.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
they
should
--
there
was
no
evidence,
of
course,
in
the
supreme
court,
but
when
an
opportunity
during
the
trial
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
but
when
the
action
was
tried,
when
the
matter
was
before
the
trial
court
on
finding
the
issues,
the
trial
court
found
on
her
and
she
contended
that
her
first
amendment
right
had
been
violated.
evidence
was
introduced
on
that
point.
the
court
found
against
her.
there
was
no
additional
question
asked
about
what
the
reasons
were
in
that
trial
of
that
action.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
there
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
discover
procee
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
superior
court.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
there
are
indeed.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
she
could've
had
pre-trial
discovery
by
interrogatories,
written
interrogatories
or
by
pre-trial
examinations
of
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
sorry?
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
it
starts
before
the
justice
of
the
peace.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
it's
de
novo.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
completely
de
novo.
it's
just
like
starting
all
over
again.
she
filed
in
lieu
of
pleadings
and
affidavits
setting
out
what
her
contentions
were
about
why
she
was
being
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
pre-trial
discovery,
yes.
but,
in
an
eviction
proceeding,
the
normal
course
is
before
a
justice
and
then
it
goes
to
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
you
can't.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
until
she
appeals
from
the
justice
--
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
and
then
she
gets
into
it,
but
it's
de
novo,
completely
new
in
the
superior
court
and,
before
you
get
to
that
stage,
she
does
have
the
discovery
proceedings
available.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
right.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
that's
correct.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
that's
right.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
they
could've
had
him
there
and
they
could've
cross-examined
him
and
ask
him
any
number
of
questions,
at
least
as
far
as
this
record
is
concerned
they
could've,
because
there
was
no
question
that
they
asked
that
was
denied
by
the
court,
there's
no
ruling
of
irrelevancy
anywhere
along
the
line
by
the
trial
court,
and
they
made
no
exception.
they
didn't
ask
the
trial
court,
“now,
will
you
expand
this
hearing
in
this
trial
court
to
require
into
other
reasons
that
might
have
existed?”
they
didn't
ask
that.
mr.
daniel

no,
sir.
the
trial
court
did
not.
it
was
never
said
in
the
trial
court
that
it
was
immaterial
at
any
stage
because
the
question
was
never
asked
in
the
trial
court,
never.
it
was
only
the
language,
that
your
honor
was
referring
to,
appears
for
the
first
time
in
the
per
curiam
deci
--
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina.
that's
the
only
place
that
that
sentence
has
ever
appeared
in
this
whole
lawsuit,
from
the
beginning
to
the
end.
that's
the
one
place
it's
appeared.
mr.
daniel
k.
edwards
it
has
created
a
confusion,
yes,
sir.
