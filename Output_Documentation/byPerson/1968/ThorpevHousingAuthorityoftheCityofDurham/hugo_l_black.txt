justice

do
you
mean

now
that
of

wouldn't
apply

private

justice

you're
saying
if
the
government
makes
a
pondering
whether
--
even
if
it
sets
up
rules
and
says
you've
got
to
obey
them,
cannot,
like
a
private
apartment,
oust
someone
for
failing
to
have
been
without
giving
them
a
hearing.
now,
could
that
be
taken
to
court
then
that
hearing
is
inadequate?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
the
difference
between
you
and
your
adversary
that
you
claim
that
these
rights
should
be
raised
in
the
court
and
they
claim
a
right
under
the
constitution,
we
can
say
that
the
constitution
requires
that
they
be
given
--
they
give
no
--
the
agent
of
the
authority
give
notice
to
them
before
they
go
to
court?
justice
hugo

and
the
statute
required
that,
as
it
does
in

you
would
of

have
to
prove
that
notice
had
been
given
or
you
couldn't
evict.
justice
hugo
l.

well,
i
don't
understand
that.
that's
what
you
did.
justice

claiming
that
you
ought
to
have
a
right
to
try
it
in
the
court
whether
or
not
you
give
them
notice
and,
if
you
didn't,
if
the
contract
required
it,
or
the
policy
of
the
act
required
it,
then
you
think
that
she
would
win
in
the
court
because
she
hadn't
been
given
notice.
justice

isn't
that
the
