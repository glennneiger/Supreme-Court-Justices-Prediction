justice
abe
fortas
is
that
really
the
issue
or
an
underlying
issue
here?
do
people
who
have
leases
with
private
landlords
have
the,
as
a
constitutional
matter,
the
right
to
for
which
you're
contending
here?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
where
do
you
get
--
justice
abe
fortas
that
--
well,
tell
me
about
that.
where
do
you
get
that
flavor
in
--
on
the
constitutional
aspects
of
this
case?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
let's
take
a
comparable
case
if
we
can
think
of
one.
let's
suppose
that
the
department
of
the
interior
has
a
--
lent
a
lease
with
a
concessionaire
to
occupy
premises
in
a
park
area,
and
the
lease
says
that
it's
terminable,
that
this
is
a
month-to-month
lease
and
it's
terminable
upon
30
days
notice,
and
there's
no
provision
for
notice
or
a
hearing
or
a
statement
of
the
reason
why
the
lease
isn't
being
renewed.
now,
does
the
concessionaire
have
a
constitutional
right
to
be
heard?
justice
abe
fortas
i
know
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
don't
think
that's
important,
mr.
nabrit
and
this
is
a
terrible
important
and
new
area
of
constitutional
law
to
which
you're
addressing
yourself
now.
and,
whether
it
is
appropriate
to
analyze
it
in
terms
of
giving
the
poor
people
rights
that
are
given
to
their
more
fortunate
fellow
citizens
or
not
is
a
problem
of
the
utmost
consequence,
i
think.
it's
a
matter
of
developing
cons
--
the
developing
application
of
constitutional
principle.
and
i,
myself,
believe
that
it's
one
that,
and
i'm
sure
you
agree
with
me,
that
requires
the
most
prayerful
and
careful
analysis
on
the
part
of
us
and,
perhaps,
the
game
is
not
advanced
when
we
merely
refer
it
--
when
we
present
a
case
like
this
in
terms
of
equalizing
the
rights
of
the
poor,
vice
versa
the
government,
with
the
rights
of
the
rich
because
you
first
have
to
establish,
if
i
may
respectfully
suggest
it
to
you,
you
first
have
to
establish
that
there
is
a
cognate
or
analogous
right
given
to
more
fortunate
citizens,
vice
versa
their
government.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
what
--
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
nabrit,
i'm
going
to
leave
you
alone
after
this,
but
it's
a
problem
of
fundamental
consequence
in
this
and
other
cases,
many
other
cases,
and
i
suggest
to
you
that
perhaps
two
possible
lines
of
approach.
one
is,
it's
sort
of
a
gideon
line
of
the
discrimination
between
the
poor
and
the
rich
with
respect
to
essential
governmental
rights.
the
other,
and
it
may
be,
and
this
is
for
you
to
argue
and
not
for
me.
if
--
and,
it
may
be
the
one
that's
applicable
to
this
case.
the
other
is
that
in
this
kind
of
governmental
activity,
that
is
to
say
the
rental
of
residential
property
whether
it's
middle-income,
high-income,
or
low-income,
the
government
takes
on
certain
responsibilities
as
a
constitutional
matter
which
a
private
landlord
does
not
have.
i
don't
know
whether
that's
right
or
wrong,
but
what
i'm
suggesting
to
you
is
the
possibility
that
that
may
be
the
basic
premise
to
which
one
must
address
for
himself.
justice
abe
fortas
but
that
assumes
that
there's
something
--
some
sort
of
right
other
than
the
rights
conferred
by
the
lease
here.
justice
abe
fortas
and
that
is
a
proposition,
if
you're
--
until
you
get
to
the
other
phase
of
your
case,
that's
a
proposition
that,
i
suggest,
you
got
to
face
up
to.
is
there
some
right
other
than
the
right
conferred
by
the
lease
here
and
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that's
all
--
justice
abe
fortas
well
--
justice
abe
fortas
here,
the
parties
entered
into
a
lease
and
the
--
so
far
as
the
lease
is
concerned,
mrs.
thorpe
may
have
been
--
her
lease
may
have
been
allowed,
it
may
have
terminated
just
because
they
were
tired
of
having
her
there,
no
reason
at
all.
in
this
record,
we
can't
really
assume,
can
we,
that
there
was
a
determination
that
she
was
--
that
her
lease
was
terminated
because
she
was
the
leader
of
this
tenants
group
or
that
she
was
guilty
of
any
sort
of
misconduct
or
even
if
that
was
considered.
justice
abe
fortas
right.
justice
abe
fortas
no,
that's
--
justice
abe
fortas
that's
exactly
what
they
want.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
what
you're
saying
is
that,
from
the
fact
of
that,
the
purpose
of
the
program
is
to
provide
housing
for
poor
people.
there
derives
a
procedural
right,
that
procedural
right
being
that
before
the
lease
is
terminated
or
allowed
to
expire
by
its
terms,
there
has
to
be
a
statement
of
charges
or
a
statement
of
reasons
and
an
opportunity
for
a
hearing
which
assumes,
too,
that
there's
got
to
be
a
reason
--
a
good
reason.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
the
statute
--
justice
abe
fortas
what
statute
say
about
it?
statute
doesn't
say
anything
about
it,
does
it?
justice
abe
fortas
your
time
--
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
sorry.
your
time
is
about
up.
can
we
dispose
of
this
case
on
the
circular,
the
hew
direction?
as
i
--
am
i
correct
in
remembering,
it's
quite
a
while
since
i
read
the
briefs
and
record
in
this
case
but,
am
i
correct
in
recalling
that
the
local
authority
held
that
circular
direction
by
hew
was
not
retroactive?
justice
abe
fortas
and
the
court
below
held
that
and
can't
we
dispose
of
the
case
if
we
should
conclude
that
the,
as
we
read
this
re-construed
direction
of
hew,
it
is
retroactive.
wouldn't
that
dispose
of
the
case?
justice
abe
fortas
but
you
mean
the
local
housing
authorities
--
justice
abe
fortas
locally.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i'm
sure,
mr.
edwards,
you
understood
my
questioning
of
mr.
nabrit.
my
--
what
i
was
trying
to
find
out
from
him
was
whether
the
principle
of
putting
the
poor
on
an
equivalent
basis
with
the
people
who
are
better
off
in
terms
of
legal
rights,
constitutional
rights,
whether
that
principle
really
got
him
anywhere
in
this
case.
that
was
my
question.
justice
abe
fortas
or
hew.
hew
pursuant
to
its
--
presumably
pursuant
to
its
statutory
authority
issued
a
circular
here,
and
that
does
provide
a
right,
for
what
it's
worth.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
edwards,
perhaps
i
don't
understand
you.
do
you
--
i
assume
that
everything
that
was
--
all
the
directions
in
the
hud
manual
and
in
the
very
circular
that's
at
issue
from
time
to
time
were
binding
as
a
matter
of
law
on
the
local
housing
authorities.
do
you
contest
that?
justice
abe
fortas
on
page
31
(a)
of
the
petitioner's
brief
is
an
excerpt
from
the
low-rent
housing
manual.
it
says
it
has
a
--
hud
has
a,
or
pha
at
that
time,
has
established
minimum
requirements
for
local
authorities,
but
you
take
the
position
that
that
is
--
that
it
has
exceeded
its
statutory
authority
in
doing
so?
justice
abe
fortas
that
exhausts
its
authority?
justice
abe
fortas
and
that
exhausts
the
hud's
authority?
justice
abe
fortas
does
the
contract
contain
any
reference
to
the
manual
or
to
circulars
or
regulations
to
be
issued
by
--
justice
abe
fortas
by
hud?
justice
abe
fortas
no
sir,
it
does
not
provide
that
hud
be
given
the
authority
to
--
justice
abe
fortas
it
says,
you
note
in
the
same
page,
the
pha
manuals,
which
are
now
hud
i
guess,
contain
the
requirements
which
supplement
the
provisions
of
the
contracts
between
the
local
authority
and
the
pha.
that
doesn't
change
your
view,
i
take
it?
justice
abe
fortas
that
didn't
so
--
i
suggest
if
you
look
at
page
32
(a)
subparagraph
4,
it
seems
to
be
just
as
broad
as
it
could
be
with
respect
to
the
operation
of
the
projects
after
initial
occupancy.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
to
pursue
my
brother
marshall
questions,
if
you
assume,
contrary
to
your
present
argument,
if
you
assume
that
this
circular
is
binding
on
the
local
housing
authority,
there's
no
question
that
it
would
require
notice,
etcetera,
to
mrs.
--
to
a
tenant
upon
termination
of
her
tenancy.
justice
abe
fortas
so,
you
think
we
really
have
to
decide
the
constitutional
question
here
because
the
circular
--
you
think
this
circular
is
just
a
statement
of
the
belief
which
may
or
may
not
be
regarded
by
the
local
authorities
praise-worthy,
but
certainly
is
not
binding
on
it.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
--
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
edwards,
would
you
take
the
same
position
if
this
were
--
housing
project
were
privately
owned
and
you
have
exactly
the
same
facts,
or
let's
take
the
more
ex
--
dramatic
illustration
that
the
chief
justice
put
to
you.
you
have
a
privately
owned
housing
authority
and
every
negro
tenant
in
it
is
terminated
all
at
once
under
the
same
kind
of
release.
would
you
say
that
the
tenants
can
challenge
the
termination
on
the
ground
--
on
the
constitutional
grounds
and
that
they
wouldn't
have
a
valid
constitutional
basis
for
challenge
if
they
could
demonstrate
that
the
termination
was
because
they
were
negros?
justice
abe
fortas
so
that,
this
is
a
qualification
of
the
property
owner's
right
in
his
property,
that
is,
the
qualification
being
that
he
cannot
discriminate
on
the
grounds
of
race
--
justice
abe
fortas
stand
terminating
the
tenancy
of
pers
--
of
tenants
because
they
are
negros.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
wouldn't
argue
anything.
i'm
asking
for
your
--
is
that
the
principle
upon
which
your
brief
is
based
when
you
say
that
the
public
housing
authority
of
durham
could
not
terminate
--
could
not
lawfully
terminate
the
tenancy
of
mrs.
thorpe
if
it
did
for
a
reason
that
--
for
the
reason
that
she
organized
this
tenants
union?
you
say,
then
you're
assuming
that
she
has
a
constitutional
right
and
my
question
to
you
is
whether
she
has
that
constitutional
right
because
this
is
a
public
agency
or
would
she
have
that
constitutional
right
even
if
it
were
a
private
agency?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
ed
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that's
right.
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
really
the
issue
or
an
underlying
issue
here?
do
people
who
have
leases
with
private
landlords
have
the,
as
a
constitutional
matter,
the
right
to
for
which
you're
contending
here?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
where
do
you
get
--
justice
abe
fortas
that
--
well,
tell
me
about
that.
where
do
you
get
that
flavor
in
--
on
the
constitutional
aspects
of
this
case?

now,
does
the

have

quite
a
while
since
i
read
the
briefs
and
record
in
this
case
but,
am
i
correct
in
recalling
that
the
local
authority
held
that
circular
direction
by
hew
was
not
retroactive?
justice
abe
fortas
and
the
court
below
held
that
and
can't
we
dispose
of
the
case
if
we
should
conclude
that
the,
as
we
read
this
re-construed
direction
of
hew,
it
is
retroactive.
wouldn't
that
dispose
of
the
case?
justice
abe
fortas
but
you
mean
the
local
housing
authorities
--
justice
abe
fortas
locally.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i'm
sure,
mr.
edwards,
you
understood
my
questioning
of
mr.
nabrit.
my
--
what
i
was
trying
to
find
out
from
him
was
whether
the
principle
of
putting
the
poor
on
an
equivalent
basis
with
the
people
who
are
better
off
in
terms
of
legal
rights,
constitutional
rights,
whether
that
principle
really
got
him
anywhere
in
this
case.
that
was
my
question.
justice
abe
fortas
or
hew.
hew
pursuant
to
its
--
presumably
pursuant
to
its
statutory
authority
issued
a
circular
here,
and
that
does
provide
a
right,
for
what
it's
worth.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
edwards,
perhaps
i
don't
understand
you.
do
you
--
i
assume
that
everything
that
was
--
all
the
directions
in
the
hud
manual
and
in
the
very
circular
that's
at
issue
from
time
to
time
were
binding
as
a
matter
of
law
on
the
local
housing
authorities.
do
you
contest
that?
justice
abe
fortas
on
page
31
(a)
of
the
petitioner's
brief
is
an
excerpt
from
the
low-rent
housing
manual.
it
says
it
has
a
--
hud
has
a,
or
pha
at
that
time,
has
established
minimum
requirements
for
local
authorities,
but
you
take
the
position
that
that
is
--
that
it
has
exceeded
its
statutory
authority
in
doing
so?
justice
abe
fortas
that
exhausts
its
authority?
justice
abe
fortas
and
that
exhausts
the
hud's
authority?
justice
abe
fortas
does
the
contract
contain
any
reference
to
the
manual
or
to
circulars
or
regulations
to
be
issued
by
--
justice
abe
fortas
by
hud?
justice
abe
fortas
no
sir,
it
does
not
provide
that
hud
be
given
the
authority
to
--
justice
abe
fortas
it
says,
you
note
in
the
same
page,
the
pha
manuals,
which
are
now
hud
i
guess,
contain
the
requirements
which
supplement
the
provisions
of
the
contracts
between
the
local
authority
and
the
pha.
that
doesn't
change
your
view,
i
take
it?
justice
abe
fortas
that
didn't
so
--
i
suggest
if
you
look
at
page
32
(a)
subparagraph
4,
it
seems
to
be
just
as
broad
as
it
could
be
with
respect
to
the
operation
of
the
projects
after
initial
occupancy.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
to
pursue
my
brother
marshall
questions,
if
you
assume,
contrary
to
your
present
argument,
if
you
assume
that
this
circular
is
binding
on
the
local
housing
authority,
there's
no
question
that
it
would
require
notice,
etcetera,
to
mrs.
--
to
a
tenant
upon
termination
of
her
tenancy.
justice
abe
fortas
so,
you
think
we
really
have
to
decide
the
constitutional
question
here
because
the
circular
--
you
think
this
circular
is
just
a
statement
of
the
belief
which
may
or
may
not
be
regarded
by
the
local
authorities
praise-worthy,
but
certainly
is
not
binding
on
it.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
--
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
edwards,
would
you
take
the
same
position
if
this
were
--
housing
project
were
privately
owned
and
you
have
exactly
the
same
facts,
or
let's
take
the
more
ex
--
dramatic
illustration
that
the
chief
justice
put
to
you.
you
have
a
privately
owned
housing
authority
and
every
negro
tenant
in
it
is
terminated
all
at
once
under
the
same
kind
of
release.
would
you
say
that
the
tenants
can
challenge
the
termination
on
the
ground
--
on
the
constitutional
grounds
and
that
they
wouldn't
have
a
valid
constitutional
basis
for
challenge
if
they
could
demonstrate
that
the
termination
was
because
they
were
negros?
justice
abe
fortas
so
that,
this
is
a
qualification
of
the
property
owner's
right
in
his
property,
that
is,
the
qualification
being
that
he
cannot
discriminate
on
the
grounds
of
race
--
justice
abe
fortas
stand
terminating
the
tenancy
of
pers
--
of
tenants
because
they
are
negros.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
wouldn't
argue
anything.
i'm
asking
for
your
--
is
that
the
principle
upon
which
your
brief
is
based
when
you
say
that
the
public
housing
authority
of
durham
could
not
terminate
--
could
not
lawfully
terminate
the
tenancy
of
mrs.
thorpe
if
it
did
for
a
reason
that
--
for
the
reason
that
she
organized
this
tenants
union?
you
say,
then
you're
assuming
that
she
has
a
constitutional
right
and
my
question
to
you
is
whether
she
has
that
constitutional
right
because
this
is
a
public
agency
or
would
she
have
that
constitutional
right
even
if
it
were
a
private
agency?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
ed
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that's
right.
