mr.
david
w.
louisell
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
few
cases
that
i
have
seen
in
recent
years,
so
much
invoke
the
ancient
admonition
owe
to
distinguish
the
reality
of
things
from
the
tyranny
of
labels,
or
as
this
court
put
it
i
believe
in
trop
against
dulles,
how
simple
would
be
the
task
of
constitution
of
adjudication
if
the
decision
of
specific
problems
were
a
matter
of
selecting
the
labels
pasted
upon
them.
we
respectfully
submit
your
honors
that
the
court,
the
three-judge
district
court
below
in
the
western
district
of
texas
by
seizing
upon
the
label
of
dombrowski
against
pfister
without
penetrating
through
to
the
context
and
the
meaning
in
context
of
that
teaching
of
this
court
that
the
three-judge
court
has
done
violence
to
the
realities
of
the
situation
as
defied
logic
experience
and
history
and
requires
reversal.
now,
our
facts
here
your
honors
are
from
a
stipulation
between
the
appellants
and
the
appellees
counsel
and
from
the
affidavits
filed
by
the
individual
plaintiffs
and
the
few
of
their
fellow
students
and
the
affidavits
of
the
sheriff
of
bell
county,
texas
and
his
deputies.
that's
the
source
of
the
facts
here,
those
stipulation
and
affidavits.
very
briefly
on
december
12,
1967,
just
a
little
more
than
four
years
within
the
shadow
of
dallas,
the
president
went
to
central
texas
college
to
make
a
dedicatory
speech.
the
night
before
his
arrival,
the
secret
service
had
a
conference
with
the
local
police
officers
of
the
surrounding
cities,
with
the
sheriffs
of
both
counties,
the
land
involved
here
lies
in
both
bell
and
coryell
counties
had
a
conference
soliciting
cooperation
in
protection
of
the
defendant
--
in
protection
of
the
president.
on
the
morning
of
december
12,
the
plaintiffs
and
others,
member
of
the
committee,
our
associates,
hearing
that
this
event
was
going
to
take
place
started
out
from
austin
about
60
or
70
miles
from
collin
and
proceeded
to
the
neighborhood
of
collin,
texas.
this
college
is
near
collin.
collin
serves
one
of
the
biggest
military
reservations
in
the
united
states
fort
hood,
thousands
of
troops
stationed
there,
many
of
them
on
the
way
to
vietnam,
many
of
them
just
returned
from
vietnam.
these
people
at
least
seven
in
number
and
at
least
in
two
automobiles
proceeded
to
the
area
of
the
college
where
the
president
was
to
speak
and
when
they
arrived
there,
he
had
begun
to
speak
or
was
about
to
begin.
they
have
their
signs,
their
signs
of
protest
against
the
war
in
vietnam.
very
shortly,
almost
immediately
i
think
i
can
say,
after
their
arrival
on
the
scene,
violence
broke
out.
i
think
i
can
put
in
a
nutshell
the
condition
of
the
violence
by
reference
to
one
item
in
the
evidence,
a
big
burly
sergeant
was
heard
to
remark,
“let
me
add
them,
they'd
never
seen
blood.”
there
were
50
cops,
their
signs
were
torn
to
shreds,
it
was
a
dangerous
situation.
mr.
david
w.
louisell
that
is
correct.
i
don't
see
how
it
was
possible.
of
course,
we
are
dealing
here
with
the
rural
area,
a
non-lawyer
justice
of
the
peace
and
so
forth,
how
it
was
possible
to
concede
that
that
statute
would
have
any
application
anything
that
these
plaintiffs
had
been
involved
in.
mr.
david
w.
louisell
i
want
to
enlarge
if
i
may.
mr.
david
w.
louisell
precisely.
it
just
had
nothing
to
do
with
this
particular
statute
with
any
of
the
facts
that
the
record
shows.
mr.
david
w.
louisell
that's
precisely
right.
mr.
david
w.
louisell
whoever
as
the
statute
reads,
whoever
shall
go
into
or
near
any
public
place
or
into
or
near
any
private
house
and
shall
use
loud
and
vociferous
or
obscene
vulgar
or
indecent
language,
or
swear
or
curse,
or
yell
or
shriek,
or
expose
his
or
her
person
to
another
person
at
the
age
of
16
years
or
over.
another
statute
of
course
rules
under
16
or
rudely
display
any
pistol
or
deadly
weapon
in
a
manner
calculated
to
disturb
the
person
of
person's
present
at
such
place
or
house
shall
be
punished
by
a
fine
not
exceeding
$200.00.
mr.
david
w.
louisell
oh!
undoubtedly
but
there's
no
indication
that
there
was
any
obscenity
involved
in
the
language
here
or
any
indecent
protest
involved
in
the
language.
the
important
thing
to
stress
it
seems
to
me
in
the
study
of
the
facts
here
that
despite
of
the
occasion
and
there
were
about
25,000
--
mr.
david
w.
louisell
i
represent
the
appellants,
the
sheriff,
the
county
attorney
and
the
justice
of
the
peace.
despite
--
mr.
david
w.
louisell
i
say
that
they
were
charged.
the
charge
under
the
statute
did
not
cover
any
of
the
conduct
that
the
record
alleges.
mr.
david
w.
louisell
it
struck
down
the
statute
as
nearly
as
one
can
tell
for
overbreadth
and
it
struck
it
down
in
the
abstract
and
it's
specifically
said
it
wasn't
examining
into
the
application
of
the
statute.
mr.
david
w.
louisell
our
position
is
twofold.
first
of
all,
that
in
the
situation
that
developed
here
with
a
dismissal
of
these
foolish
criminal
charges
under
the
so-called
“disturb
or
dist
the
peace”
complaint
that
had
been
filed.
the
dismissal
of
those
charges
and
the
complete
absence
of
the
scintilla
of
indication
that
the
state
of
texas
was
using
this
statute
to
repress
freedom
of
speech
rendered
the
case
surely
an
advisory
proposition,
and
that
the
three-judge
court
should
have
grant
the
motion
to
dismissed.
that's
the
first
proposition.
the
second
proposition
is
that
if
you
do
have
to
reach
the
question
of
the
statutes
constitutionality
or
if
the
court
below
had
to
on
its
face
did
as
clearly
nothing
unconstitutional
statute
as
vague
or
overbroad.
mr.
david
w.
louisell
they
didn't
interpret
it
below
your
honor.
that
--
i
will
excuse
that,
i
mean
they
didn't
apply
it
to
the
facts.
you
will
note
from
the
opinion
of
the
court
below
on
page
89,
the
court
said
before
we
discuss
the
issues
presented
as
to
the
merits
of
this
controversy,
it
may
be
wise
to
state
what
is
not
involved,
at
the
top
of
page
89.
this
case
does
not
involve
in
any
way
an
appraisal
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
application
of
the
statutes
to
the
plaintiffs.
we
do
not
evaluate
whether
article
474
was
constitutionally
applied
to
these
plaintiff's
activity.
our
sole
concern
is
the
determination
of
whether
article
474
on
its
face
is
--
and
so
forth
unconstitutional.
mr.
david
w.
louisell
the
injunction
and
i
must
admit
it
is
couched
in
very
unusual
format.
the
injunction
comes
at
the
very
end
of
that
opinion
on
page
92
at
the
very
bottom
of
the
page.
mr.
david
w.
louisell
that
is
correct.
and
it
--
mr.
david
w.
louisell
that
is
all
we
have
by
way
of
a
judgment
in
this
case.
mr.
david
w.
louisell
and
that
is
why
it's
here,
that
is
the
appeal
was
taken.
mr.
david
w.
louisell
that
would
be
the
correct
procedure,
reverse
with
instructions
to
dismiss
the
complaint
as
utterly
a
non-existent
controversy.
mr.
david
w.
louisell
i
believe
--
yes
your
honor.
but,
it
would
be
--
mr.
david
w.
louisell
that
is
precisely
right,
and
i
think
that
can
be
shown
by
--
if
you
wish,
i
get
right
into
that.
i
might
just
mention
a
little
more
of
the
chronology
here
in
case
it
isn't
completely
clear,
the
point
i
wanted
to
stress
about
the
facts
is
that
no
state
official,
no
state
trooper,
no
sheriff,
no
city
policemen
did
anything
to
inhibit
these
people
coming
in
making
their
protest.
mr.
david
w.
louisell
may
i
just
state
the
exact
thesis
of
the
dismissal
logs
that
it
took
place
on
the
federal
enclave
and
was
not
even
within
the
jurisdiction.
mr.
david
w.
louisell
correct.
mr.
david
w.
louisell
well,
they
said
they
would
await
any
further
injunctive
order
until
a
meeting
of
the
texas
legislature,
which
legislature
has
convene
--
mr.
david
w.
louisell
but
they
also
said
that
plaintiffs
were
entitled
to
an
injunction.
mr.
david
w.
louisell
that
is
correct.
mr.
david
w.
louisell
precisely,
those
were
the
two
points
that
i
wish
to
emphasize.
now,
to
make
the
rest
of
the
chronology
very
brief,
remember
if
i
may
say
this
that
it
was
the
military
police
who
detain
these
plaintiffs,
and
it
was
only
after
they
had
detained
and
that
they
were
brought
into
the
presence
of
the
state
people
that
they
were
taken
by
the
state
people
to
the
jail
were
this
charge
which
it
hadn't
been
dismissed
because
of
the
federal
enclave,
certainly,
would
have
had
to
be
dismissed
for
the
reasons
already
suggested
from
the
bench.
they
were
release
on
bail.
their
attorney
promptly
came
and
got
them
release
on
bail,
and
it
was
on
december
21st
that
they
started
this
three-judge
suit.
on
february
13
as
i
already
mentioned,
all
these
criminal
charges
were
dismissed,
february
13,
1968.
on
february
15
therefore,
the
defendants,
the
appellants
here,
defendants
in
the
three-judge
suit
move
to
dismiss
the
suit
for
the
reasons
already
suggested
from
the
bench.
counsel
for
these
appellants
wanted
the
motion,
in
fact,
he
made
a
special
motion
to
have
his
motion
to
dismiss
her
at
first,
but
the
court
insisted
on
merging
the
motion
to
dismiss
with
a
hearing
on
the
merits
and
filed
the
opinion
that
we've
just
read
from
that
concluding
order
part
of
it
on
april
10th.
there
was
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
that
was
denied
a
so-called
the
addendum
opinion
written
and
the
appeal
was
taken
to
this
court.
mr.
david
w.
louisell
that
is
correct.
mr.
david
w.
louisell
i'm
saying
that
i
cannot
concede
how
that
complaint
would
make
a
charge
that
is
a
sustainable
charge
under
474.
mr.
david
w.
louisell
that's
right.
remember,
this
was
a
form
of
course
in
print,
it
looks
as
though
it
were
a
new
document,
but
it
was
a
form
merely
filled
in
by
the
justice
with
those
--
mr.
david
w.
louisell
well,
your
honor,
it
was
intended
undoubtedly
by
the
lay
justice
of
the
peace
to
be
in
charge,
but
you
don't
charge
a
person
with
disturbing
peace.
you
may
as
a
preliminary
matter
hoping
for
a
plea
of
guilty,
but
his
sustainable
legal
charge
would
have
to
be
in
the
language
that
you're
complaining
about,
that
they
did
viably
and
vociferously
in
a
public
place
and
so
forth.
just
like
you
don't
charge
a
man
with
murder,
you
charge
him
with
having
on
such
and
such
a
date.
mr.
david
w.
louisell
that
it
never
was
a
valid
criminal
charge.
mr.
david
w.
louisell
--
made
against
these
people.
mr.
david
w.
louisell
i'd
say
that
4
--
this
was
not
a
sustainable
legal
charge
under
474
in
my
judgment.
but
i
don't
suppose
that's
too
important
because
in
any
event,
this
was
dismissed.
this
was
dismissed
because
of
the
federal
enclave
proposition.
but
have
not
been
dismissed
your
honor
because
of
the
federal
enclave.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
justice
unless
it
where
amended
correctly
to
state
a
charge,
would
have
had
to
throw
it
all
upon
motion
of
the
defendants,
and
he
didn't
certainly
the
criminal
court
of
appeals
would've
thrown
that.
and
therefore
when
they
come
into
federal
court,
with
a
three-judge
suit,
there's
just
no
real
fight
of
any
true
kind
to
complain
about.
now,
if
i
may
come
to
the
substance
of
the
case
as
already
been
indicated
from
the
bench
from
a
legal
viewpoint,
this
really
merges
into
the
two
points
you
indicated
mr.
justice
fortas,
the
advisory
point
and
the
question
of
the
official
so-called
unconstitutionality
of
the
statute.
in
addition
to
the
cases
in
our
brief
on
the
advisory
point,
this
court
will
remember
just
of
the
last
term
that
comprehensive
review
of
the
whole
frothingham
problem
in
flast
against
cohen
where
the
court
had
occasioned
to
go,
i
think
to
the
philosophic
depths
of
the
whole
notion
of
justiciability
and
the
advisory
opinion
as
a
function
of
it.
and
in
addition
to
the
case
as
cited
to
in
the
brief,
i
invite
particular
attention
to
cases
as
old
as
the
famous
muskrat
case
and
even
older,
the
case
cited
in
the
flast
against
cohen
opinion,
california
against
the
san
pablo
railroad,
and
the
other
case
cited
in
the
flast
opinion.
but
if
really
seems
to
me,
it
really
seems
to
me
that
the
most
recent
cases
of
this
court
just
the
princess
anne
county
commission
case
decided
at
this
very
term
wherein
even
tending
order
was
set
aside
because
it
was
ex
parte
with
no
chance
for
an
advisory
exchange.
that
case
although
brought
up
by
the
appellees
i
think
is
excellent
authority
where
realistic
appraisal
of
whether
there
was
any
contest,
any
genuine
justiciable
controversy
before
the
federal
three-judge
court.
on
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute,
if
that
has
to
be
reached,
let
me
just
say
that
if
this
statute
is
on
constitution
when
he
brought
is
guilty
of
overbreadth
or
of
vagueness,
what
about
our
california
comparable
section
415
of
the
penal
code?
what
about
the
new
york's
section
on
disorderly
conduct
revised
as
recently
as
1965,
section
24.20
of
mckinney's
new
york
statute?
what
about
the
connecticut
statute
that
is
set
forth
in
detail
in
the
case
we
cite,
the
case
of
barber
against
kinsella?
what
about
the
minnesota
statute
to
pick
up
the
western
jurisdiction?
minnesota
statutes
annotated
section
609.72
even
the
american
high
institute
hasn't
been
able
to
do
anything
much
more
satisfactory
than
this
texas
language.
in
its
proposed
section
250.2
on
disorderly
conduct
makes
unreasonable
annoy
or
offensively
course
utterance
and
so
forth.
i
submit
in
confidence
that
a
condemnation
of
the
texas
statute
written
of
course
not
scientific
judge
and
not
so
many
decibels,
but
in
the
common
part
of
the
country,
it's
perfectly
beyond
the
path
on
its
face
as
unconstitutional.
if
it's
even
a
been
or
it
can
ever
it
is
applied
in
such
a
way
is
to
deny
people
their
first
amendment
rights
or
to
inhibit
in
any
realistic
sense,
not
only
this
texas
law,
but
federal
law
under
this
court's
holding
monroe
against
pape
provides
a
very
fine
remedy
--
mr.
david
w.
louisell
not
precisely
that
because
if
in
fact
the
threat
of
the
statute's
application
to
inhibit
first
amendment
rights,
lurked
in
the
background
like
in
the
dombrowski
case
--
mr.
david
w.
louisell
not
at
all.
in
that
case,
of
course,
there's
a
very
serious
basic
substantive
conflict
of
offering
a
free
speech
--
mr.
david
w.
louisell
that
is,
it
isn't
the
proper
suit.
mr.
david
w.
louisell
well,
i
don't
say
you
have
to
reach
that
question,
no.
but
if
you
do
reach
it,
i
do
say
the
answer
is
very
clear
and
i
think
that
could
a
situation
is
very
clearly
distinguishable,
there
as
i
read
the
opinion
of
this
court.
mr.
david
w.
louisell
well,
(voice
overlap)
the
krueger
case
has
gone
back
to
the
district
court
where
there
is
relief
--
mr.
david
w.
louisell
that
is
right.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
david
w.
louisell
may
it
please
the
court,
of
course,
the
situation
in
the
princess
anne
county
just
referred
to
by
counsel
was
that
there
was
an
extent
injunction
that
was
a
precedent
and
that
the
officials
were
relying
upon
to
prevent
another
meeting
before
this
court
struck
down
that
injunction.
in
submitting
this
case,
your
honors,
i
have
only
two
points
to
make
at
this
time.
far
from
sustaining
the
heavy
burden
of
showing
a
texas
policy
to
use
article
474
to
staple
speech,
i
don't
think
i
exaggerate
when
i
say
there's
hardly
any
showing
of
such
a
policy,
except
the
conclusory
statements
in
the
affidavits
that
their
rights
are
chilled
because
of
what
took
place.
mr.
david
w.
louisell
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
david
w.
louisell
what
if
that
was
chilled
to
any
extent
your
honor.
they
must
be
very
chillable
people.
mr.
david
w.
louisell
in
the
epperson
case
however
as
the
court
very
carefully
pointed
out,
it
was
from
a
state
court
where
the
trial
court
had
granted
the
relief,
where
the
appellate
court
of
the
state
wrote
that
two
sentence
opinion,
and
where
as
the
writer
of
this
court's
opinion
say
of
the
case
is
here
from
a
state
court
which
we
think
is
an
entirely
distinguishable
situation.
now
in
this
case,
there
is
no
suspicion,
there's
even
no
possibility
of
suspecting
racial
prejudice
in
the
case
at
bar
because
local
counsel
inform
me
all
the
persons
involved
were
white
people.
if
you
go
to
all
the
texas
cases
in
both
of
our
brief,
you
won't
find
i
don't
believe
your
honors,
one,
that
even
concerns
the
content
of
speech,
except
one
involving
cursing,
and
there
the
court
said,
isn't
enough
show
cursing
to
justify
a
conviction,
the
cursing
must
be
shown
to
have
done
--
have
been
done
in
a
manner
reasonably
calculated
to
disturb
the
peace.
i
think
we
can
almost
take.
i
don't
exaggerate
when
i
say
we
can
almost
take
judicial
notice
that
protesting,
including
protesting
about
vietnam
is
as
open,
uninhibited
at
the
university
of
texas
in
austin
as
it
is
in
berkley,
california.
mr.
david
w.
louisell
it
was
a
$400.00
bail
your
honor,
where
the
maximum
(voice
overlap)
punishment
--
mr.
david
w.
louisell
twice
as
much
and
of
course,
nobody
would
justify
that
your
honor.
no
sensible
person
would
stand
before
this
tribunal
and
justify
that.
when
you
take
into
account,
the
circumstances
though,
if
there
was
overreaction
here
your
honor,
the
tremendous
nerve-racking
circumstances
of
that
event,
will
that
be
likely
to
reoccur
again?
these
local
people,
a
lay
justice
of
the
peace,
and
if
there
is
that
kind
of
abuse,
it
is
with
pride
that
i
can
say
that
this
court
had
made
clear
the
right
to
a
remedy
under
the
civil
rights
act
in
monroe
against
pape.
mr.
david
w.
louisell
there
is
nothing
to
that
effect,
but
there
is
in
the
affidavits
of
the
sheriff
and
the
deputy
sheriffs
any
deny
–
denial
of
any
mistreatment.
(voice
overlap)
mr.
david
w.
louisell
i
don't
believe
that
those
words.
i
forget
exactly
to
whom
was
attributed
of
the
word
traitor,
but
i
don't
think
--
mr.
david
w.
louisell
for
that
reprehensible
conduct,
there
is
an
adequate
remedy
under
this
court's
decisions
in
monroe
against
pape,
but
the
remedy
isn't
your
honor
to
reach
out
and
declare
unconstitutional
statute
in
the
abstract.
if
this
--
if
the
court
below
is
right
about
474,
article
474
in
declaring
in
the
abstract
for
facial
unconstitutionality
so-called,
i
submit
to
this
court
as
far
as
i
can
find
every
disturbing
of
the
peace,
every
breach
of
the
peace
and
probably
every
disorderly
conduct
statute
in
this
country
would
fall.
can
society
afford
that?
this
free
speech
required
that.
mr.
david
w.
louisell
why,
no?
if
the
judge
is
being
willing
to
go
into
the
question,
the
lower
court
judge,
the
three-judge,
if
they
had
been
willing
to
go
into
it,
but
they
deliberately
said
we
won't
examine
into
the
application
of
the
statute
to
the
facts
here.
we
insist
upon
doing
this
in
the
abstract.
now
your
honor,
i
see
my
time
is
up
and
in
submitting
this
case,
i
just
want
to
say
this,
--
mr.
david
w.
louisell
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
louisell
i
represent
the
three
appellants;
the
sheriff,
the
justice
of
the
peace,
and
the
county
attorney
of
the
county
involved.
the
state
came
into
the
--
mr.
david
w.
louisell
the
state
of
texas
is
in
no
way
a
party.
the
attorney
general
as
the
senior
law
officer
of
the
state
in
view
of
the
nature
of
this
attack
on
the
statute
of
the
state
took
part
in
assisted
in
the
defense
of
these
three
appellants.
mr.
david
w.
louisell
yes
your
honor,
that
is
the
at
least
the
assistant
attorney
general,
the
act
of
trial
counsel
in
this
case
is
a
party
to
the
brief
in
this
court,
yes.
when
a
group
for
example
comes
to
a
classroom
door
or
window,
and
by
shrieky
and
raising
a
great
den
disrupts
that
class
with
the
purpose
of
doing
that;
is
that
free
speech?
your
honors,
that
is
the
thing
that
prevents
free
speech,
and
it
is
exactly
at
that
type
of
failure
that
474,
article
474
is
aimed
in
order
to
continue
a
civilization
that
will
make
free
speech.
mr.
david
w.
louisell
there
is
no
question.
if
their
allegations
however
deny
they
are
by
the
affidavits
of
the
sheriff
and
the
deputies
and
so
forth,
if
those
allegations
are
in
good
faith
allegations,
if
in
fact
they
are
true,
they
have
every
right
to
relief.
in
fact,
the
complaint
presumably
also
seeks
a
relief
in
dollars.
they
have
every
right
under
the
monroe
case,
if
there
is
any
truth
at
all
to
those
allegations.
and
i
wouldn't
for
a
moment
deny,
but
to
reach
out
and
declare
in
the
abstract
a
statute
is
unconstitutional
that
would
strike
down
every
other
statute
in
the
union
of
a
comparable
nature,
i
submit
is
not
in
the
interest
of
free
speech
in
any
possible
way.
mr.
david
w.
louisell
if
your
honors
please,
in
view
of
the
time
limits,
we
must
submit
the
matter
of
appealability
that
we
were
discussing
yesterday
on
our
supplemental
brief.
we
submit
that
it's
covered
there.
if
not
a
judgment
we
have
here
under
the
statute
a
reviewable
order.
i
might
only
say
that
the
appellees
themselves
in
their
motion
to
affirm
with
great
candor
acknowledge
this,
so
far
as
it's
relevant,
and
they
pointed
out
on
page
2
of
their
motion
to
affirm
that
under
reynolds
against
sims,
a
reapportionment
case,
they
had
no
doubt
about
the
appealability
of
the
order
here.
it
would
of
course
be
very
unfortunate
i
think
from
a
viewpoint
of
judicial
administration.
the
case
have
--
mr.
david
w.
louisell
well,
that's
--
mr.
david
w.
louisell
and
of
course
as
we
point
out
in
the
supplemental
brief
but
there
is,
is
in
the
last
paragraph
--
mr.
david
w.
louisell
--
of
the
court's
opinion.
your
honors,
it
seems
to
us
that
the
crux
of
this
case,
the
real
turning
point
when
it
might
have
gone
the
right
way
was
on
the
motion
by
the
appellants
to
dismiss
made
very
promptly
within
a
day
or
two
after
all
of
the
criminal
complaints
in
the
state
court
had
been
dismissed.
at
that
point,
we
submit
to
your
honors,
there
was
no
case
or
controversy.
anything
more
to
be
done
was
a
simple
matter
of
advice
and
advisory
opinion
and
from
the
beginning
of
this
nation
to
the
present
time,
the
teaching
of
this
court
is
there
was
no
occasion,
no
reason,
no
right
to
go
ahead
and
render
an
advisory
opinion.
the
court
insisted
on
so-called
using
the
phrase
“we
will
carry
this
motion
with
the
case.”
if
it
had
faced
up
to
the
motion
explicitly,
what
happened
might
not
have
happened.
now
remember,
if
i
may
say
as
far
as
dombrowski
goes
and
i
wish
there
were
time
for
a
full
review
of
it
although
there
has
been
so
much
rethinking
and
refreshing
by
the
court
in
any
event,
i
doubt
it
would
be
necessary.
but
far
from
the
facts
here
invoking
dombrowski
where
there
was
a
bona
fide
allegation
of
deliberate,
intentional,
none
of
good
faith
used
of
the
very
complicated
statute
to
effect
racial
repression
far
from
those
facts
being
involved
here,
and
even
assuming
every
disputed
fact
or
anything
that
we
can
imagine
was
disputed
here
in
favor
of
the
appellees,
this
was
a
one-shot
proposition.
this
wasn't
a
continuing
concert
of
effort
to
deprive
anybody
of
his
rights.
instead
of
dombrowski
being
controlling,
i
submit
to
you
there
are
controlling
words
in
cameron
against
johnson.
if
the
mere
possibility
of
erroneous
application
of
the
statute,
the
mere
possibility
of
such
erroneous
application
of
the
statute
does
not
amount
to
the
irreparable
injury
necessary
to
justify
a
disruption
of
orderly
state
procedure.
all
the
good
that
may
be
done
--
mr.
david
w.
louisell
i'm
saying
that
when
those
criminal
cases
were
dismissed
mr.
justice
white,
there
was
no
longer
a
case
or
controversy.
the
state
had
given
up
every
effort.
there
was
no
reason
to
go
ahead
with
the
federal
three-judge
case.
mr.
david
w.
louisell
i
would
still
say
that
it
wasn't
the
type
of
situation,
but
with
the
dismissal
any
pretense
of
excuse
--
mr.
david
w.
louisell
within
golden
of
course
and
the
necessary
or
the
necessary
distinction
between
the
declaratory
judgment
and
injunction
thinking,
i
invoke
all
that.
but
even
within
golden,
i
would
say
would
confirm,
make
more
explicit
of
what
i've
said
about
the
applicability
of
cameron
against
johnson.
mr.
david
w.
louisell
if
there
were
a
genuine
position
to
that
effect,
there
might
be
within
the
doctrine
of
golden
from
dombrowski
through
golden,
there
might
have
been.
but
there
was
nothing
here
far
from
meeting
the
strong
requirement
of
the
very
words
of
dombrowski.
there
wasn't
even
a
serious
claim
that
there
was
any
concerted
effort
to
keep
--
mr.
david
w.
louisell
well,
if
there
were
a
bona
fide
--
if
there
were
a
real
showing,
a
real
position
that
they
were
so
inhibited
by
the
statute;
that
would
be
one
thing,
but
i
want
to
come
to
that
and
show
that
the
statute
has
construed
never
in
texas
had
been
attempted
to
reach
the
content
of
the
speech.
it
was
only
a
method
of
controlling
disturbance
in
the
historical
meaning
of
disorderly
conduct
statutes.
mr.
david
w.
louisell
there
was
an
actual
allegation
of
deterrence,
but
i
submit
there's
absolutely
nothing,
but
for
narrow,
conslusary
mere
allegation.
now,
we
all
know
even
from
the
view
point
of
the
strongest
support
of
the
dombrowski
philosophy,
dombrowski
is
strong
medicine
in
the
federal
state
relationship
and
i
respectfully
submit
that
unless
taken
according
to
prescription,
strong
medicine
is
poison.
but
giving
to
the
claims
of
the
appellees
every
possible
intend
and
then
every
assumption.
mr.
justice
white,
if
it's
true
that
they
were
being
kept
out
of
the
county
by
a
concert
of
action
between
these
people,
wasn't
the
remedy
to
grant
an
injunction
against
that
sort
of
an
abuse
rather
than
to
reach
out
and
declare
unconstitutional,
a
conventional
orthodox
disorderly
conduct
statute?
mr.
david
w.
louisell
the
whole
statute.
mr.
david
w.
louisell
at
one
point,
they
seem
to
be
emphasizing
one
part
of
it.
mr.
david
w.
louisell
but
the
net
conclusion
is
in
the
assumption
among
the
lower
courts
of
texas
apparently
is
the
justices
that
all
of
474
has
gone.
mr.
david
w.
louisell
you
can't
tell
the
precise
notion
the
court
had
in
mind.
mr.
david
w.
louisell
but
they
did
say
entitlement
to
injunctive
relief.
i
want
to
reserve
a
few
minutes
so
i
would
just
say
now
that
of
course
historically,
the
purpose
of
this
statute
i
supposed
was
to
meet
the
conventional
types
of
disorder,
things
on
the
street,
disturbances
in
church
and
so
forth.
today,
the
need
for
this
kind
of
a
statute
is
the
kind
of
a
situation
where
a
mob
may
come
to
a
school
room,
a
classroom,
and
screech
and
shout
so
as
to
disrupt.
your
honors,
that
has
nothing
more
to
do
with
free
speech
than
the
fact
that
it
involves
the
noise
from
the
vocal
chords.
mr.
david
w.
louisell
of
course,
they
didn't
direct
themselves
to
that
specifically,
but
in
the
final
conclusion
of
the
court,
the
whole
statute
went.
mr.
david
w.
louisell
no
exceptions
to
the
condemnation.
mr.
david
w.
louisell
they
did
say
that.
well
of
course,
the
next
session
of
the
legislature
met
and
adjourned
without
taking
any
action
as
we
point
out
in
our
supplemental
brief.
mr.
david
w.
louisell
that
is
--
mr.
david
w.
louisell
there
is
the
concluding
paragraph
and
of
course,
if
we
did
have--
mr.
david
w.
louisell
--
if
the
court
had
been
obedient
to
the
notion
that
your
honor
just
put,
we
would
have
a
specific
injunction.
but
you
can
go
to
the
whole
opinion
of
the
court
including
the
so-called
addendum
opinion
to
see
the
completeness
of
the
condemnation
of
section
474.
mr.
david
w.
louisell
if
the
court
please
--
mr.
david
w.
louisell
before
i
forget,
i
just
wanted
to
point
out
all
that
this
court
has
done
to
make
freedom
of
speech
really
viable
when
it
has
an
orderly
procedure
before
it
as
contrasted
with
what
went
on
here,
i
simply
refer
to
your
own
recent
decision
in
the
bachelor
case
for
maryland.
and
if
i
may
add
two
california
cases,
certainly
a
court
trying
to
be
obedient
to
your
teaching
on
free
speech,
they
were
too
late
to
get
into
the
brief.
these
case
has
shown
how
you
don't
reach
out
to
strike
down
the
california
disorderly
conduct
statute
because
you
got
to
grant
some
kind
of
relief,
in
re
cay
in
1
california
3rd
930,
in
re
bushman,
1
california
3rd
767.
now
the
one
thing
that
mr.
justice
stewart
directed
himself
to
us
all
i
will
have
time
to
comment
upon,
but
i
would
like
to
call
your
honors'
attention
to
the
fact
that
we're
not
dealing
here
with
rule
65
that
uses
the
phraseology
preliminary
injunction,
temporary
restraining
order
and
permanent
injunction.
we're
dealing
with
section
1253,
an
order
fortunately,
i
need
to
take
your
honor
if
even
i
had
a
time
on
this,
your
honors
had
occasion
carefully
to
rethink
this
problem
in
the
goldstein
case.
in
the
cole
against
richardson
proposition,
that
was
referred
to
from
the
bench
yesterday,
that
as
i
understand
it
from
the
concurring
opinion,
there
was
only
very
brief
per
curiam
order
and
the
dissenting
opinion,
in
that
case,
the
matter
was
one
of
mootness.
there
was
no
possible
claim
of
mootness
here
your
honors.
mr.
david
w.
louisell
but
wouldn't
it
be
a
very
serious
commentary
on
judicial
administration
if
an
opinion
that
is
so
effective
but
for
mr.
justice
black's
restraining
order,
his
stay
of
mandate
that
is
so
effective
as
a
practical
matter
and
remember,
there's
no
other
review
except
to
this
court
--
mr.
david
w.
louisell
an
outrageous
situation
and
also
i
invoke,
i
invite
the
attention
of
your
honor
to
the
fact
that
you
can't
blame
counsel
for
the
appellants
or
for
appellees
for
that
matter
because
the
very
last
sentence
of
rule
58
provides
“attorney
shall
not
submit
forms
of
judgment
except
upon
direction
of
the
court,
and
these
direction
shall
not
be
given
as
a
matter
of
course.
”
i
have
to
leave
it
to
the
court
to
find
a
way
of
avoiding
the
continuation
of
a
reprehensible
order
that's
operating
de
facto
as
an
advisory
opinion
and
arrest
the
processes
of
enforcing
the
law
in
the
state.
something
has
to
be
done
or
the
situation
will
become
impossible.
mr.
david
w.
louisell
yes.
mr.
david
w.
louisell
hopefully,
certainly
it
would.
mr.
david
w.
louisell
in
the
appendix
your
honor,
and
i
again
call
your
attention
to
the
fact
that
in
the
docket
entries,
it
is
referred
to
as
a
judgment.
mr.
david
w.
louisell
you
must
turn
to
the
last
paragraph
of
the
opinion.
you
don't
find
as
i
said
yesterday,
you
do
not
find
any
separately
entered
document.
rule
58
was
again
violated
--
mr.
david
w.
louisell
but
your
honors
--
mr.
david
w.
louisell
you
will
remember
in
how
many
instances,
in
fact
the
very
rules
provide
that
if
findings
of
fact
and
conclusions
are
embraced
within
an
opinion
you
can
use
that
--
mr.
david
w.
louisell
now,
if
you
can
substance
a
judgment
is
embraced
within
a
form
of
words
concluding
an
opinion,
even
though
it
isn't
entered
as
the
rule
requires
on
a
separate
piece
of
paper,
we
respectfully
submit
it
can
constitute
at
least,
i
submit
this
court
should
refrain.
mr.
david
w.
louisell
no,
and
i
think
--
of
course,
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
case
at
that
stage
but
the
attorney
general's
office
--
mr.
david
w.
louisell
yes.
the
argument
of
first
appeal,
but
the
attorney
--
mr.
david
w.
louisell
to
my
knowledge,
no.
but
your
honors
will
note
again
the
last
sentence
of
rule
58,
this
is
a
matter
that's
left
to
the
court
and
the
court
has
never
entered
what
it
should
have
done
rule
58,
but
that
is
--
mr.
david
w.
louisell
that
isn't
the
question
as
we
respectfully
submit
the
question
issue,
mr.
justice
douglas.
the
question
is
there
any
kind
of
an
order
under
1253
of
the
judicial
code.
mr.
david
w.
louisell
the
language
of
1253
is
not
in
terms
of
a
preliminary
injunction.
it
is
an
interlocutory
order
granting
or
denying
relief.
mr.
david
w.
louisell
there
is,
the
explicit
provision
that
the
court
stay
expires
upon
the
termination
of
the
next
session
of
the
state
legislature.
mr.
david
w.
louisell
the
stay
of
what
the
court
conceived
out
as
its
injunction.
mr.
david
w.
louisell
your
honor,
words
are
words,
owe
to
distinguish
the
reality
of
things,
criteria
--
mr.
david
w.
louisell
the
whole
problem
of
an
establishment
of
a
contempt
of
course
would
be
a
very
difficult
thing,
but
with
the
clear
intend,
with
the
intention
that
is
deducible
from
the
words
of
the
opinion,
i
would
say
it's
conceivable
in
any,
you
have
being
subject
to
a
contempt
order
is
not
the
definition
of
section
1253
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
david
w.
louisell
yes,
but
any
--
mr.
david
w.
louisell
we
have
what
the
judge
intended
to
embrace
within
his
opinion
as
an
order.
however,
it
had
to
--
such
a
thing
was
done.
mr.
david
w.
louisell
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
few
cases
that
i
have
seen
in
recent
years,
so
much
invoke
the
ancient
admonition
owe
to
distinguish
the
reality
of
things
from
the
tyranny
of
labels,
or
as
this
court
put
it
i
believe
in
trop
against
dulles,
how
simple
would
be
the
task
of
constitution
of
adjudication
if
the
decision
of
specific
problems
were
a
matter
of
selecting
the
labels
pasted
upon
them.
we
respectfully
submit
your
honors
that
the
court,
the
three-judge
district
court
below
in
the
western
district
of
texas
by
seizing
upon
the
label
of
dombrowski
against
pfister
without
penetrating
through
to
the
context
and
the
meaning
in
context
of
that
teaching
of
this
court
that
the
three-judge
court
has
done
violence
to
the
realities
of
the
situation
as
defied
logic
experience
and
history
and
requires
reversal.
now,
our
facts
here
your
honors
are
from
a
stipulation
between
the
appellants
and
the
appellees
counsel
and
from
the
affidavits
filed
by
the
individual
plaintiffs
and
the
few
of
their
fellow
students
and
the
affidavits
of
the
sheriff
of
bell
county,
texas
and
his
deputies.
that's
the
source
of
the
facts
here,
those
stipulation
and
affidavits.
very
briefly
on
december
12,
1967,
just
a
little
more
than
four
years
within
the
shadow
of
dallas,
the
president
went
to
central
texas
college
to
make
a
dedicatory
speech.
the
night
before
his
arrival,
the
secret
service
had
a
conference
with
the
local
police
officers
of
the
surrounding
cities,
with
the
sheriffs
of
both
counties,
the
land
involved
here
lies
in
both
bell
and
coryell
counties
had
a
conference
soliciting
cooperation
in
protection
of
the
defendant
--
in
protection
of
the
president.
on
the
morning
of
december
12,
the
plaintiffs
and
others,
member
of
the
committee,
our
associates,
hearing
that
this
event
was
going
to
take
place
started
out
from
austin
about
60
or
70
miles
from
collin
and
proceeded
to
the
neighborhood
of
collin,
texas.
this
college
is
near
collin.
collin
serves
one
of
the
biggest
military
reservations
in
the
united
states
fort
hood,
thousands
of
troops
stationed
there,
many
of
them
on
the
way
to
vietnam,
many
of
them
just
returned
from
vietnam.
these
people
at
least
seven
in
number
and
at
least
in
two
automobiles
proceeded
to
the
area
of
the
college
where
the
president
was
to
speak
and
when
they
arrived
there,
he
had
begun
to
speak
or
was
about
to
begin.
they
have
their
signs,
their
signs
of
protest
against
the
war
in
vietnam.
very
shortly,
almost
immediately
i
think
i
can
say,
after
their
arrival
on
the
scene,
violence
broke
out.
i
think
i
can
put
in
a
nutshell
the
condition
of
the
violence
by
reference
to
one
item
in
the
evidence,
a
big
burly
sergeant
was
heard
to
remark,
“let
me
add
them,
they'd
never
seen
blood.”
there
were
50
cops,
their
signs
were
torn
to
shreds,
it
was
a
dangerous
situation.
mr.
david
w.
louisell
that
is
correct.
i
don't
see
how
it
was
possible.
of
course,
we
are
dealing
here
with
the
rural
area,
a
non-lawyer
justice
of
the
peace
and
so
forth,
how
it
was
possible
to
concede
that
that
statute
would
have
any
application
anything
that
these
plaintiffs
had
been
involved
in.
mr.
david
w.
louisell
i
want
to
enlarge
if
i
may.
mr.
david
w.
louisell
precisely.
it
just
had
nothing
to
do
with
this
particular
statute
with
any
of
the
facts
that
the
record
shows.
mr.
david
w.
louisell
that's
precisely
right.
mr.
david
w.
louisell
whoever
as
the
statute
reads,
whoever
shall
go
into
or
near
any
public
place
or
into
or
near
any
private
house
and
shall
use
loud
and
vociferous
or
obscene
vulgar
or
indecent
language,
or
swear
or
curse,
or
yell
or
shriek,
or
expose
his
or
her
person
to
another
person
at
the
age
of
16
years
or
over.
another
statute
of
course
rules
under
16
or
rudely
display
any
pistol
or
deadly
weapon
in
a
manner
calculated
to
disturb
the
person
of
person's
present
at
such
place
or
house
shall
be
punished
by
a
fine
not
exceeding
$200.00.
mr.
david
w.
louisell
oh!
undoubtedly
but
there's
no
indication
that
there
was
any
obscenity
involved
in
the
language
here
or
any
indecent
protest
involved
in
the
language.
the
important
thing
to
stress
it
seems
to
me
in
the
study
of
the
facts
here
that
despite
of
the
occasion
and
there
were
about
25,000
--
mr.
david
w.
louisell
i
represent
the
appellants,
the
sheriff,
the
county
attorney
and
the
justice
of
the
peace.
despite
--
mr.
david
w.
louisell
i
say
that
they
were
charged.
the
charge
under
the
statute
did
not
cover
any
of
the
conduct
that
the
record
alleges.
mr.
david
w.
louisell
it
struck
down
the
statute
as
nearly
as
one
can
tell
for
overbreadth
and
it
struck
it
down
in
the
abstract
and
it's
specifically
said
it
wasn't
examining
into
the
application
of
the
statute.
mr.
david
w.
louisell
our
position
is
twofold.
first
of
all,
that
in
the
situation
that
developed
here
with
a
dismissal
of
these
foolish
criminal
charges
under
the
so-called
“disturb
or
dist
the
peace”
complaint
that
had
been
filed.
the
dismissal
of
those
charges
and
the
complete
absence
of
the
scintilla
of
indication
that
the
state
of
texas
was
using
this
statute
to
repress
freedom
of
speech
rendered
the
case
surely
an
advisory
proposition,
and
that
the
three-judge
court
should
have
grant
the
motion
to
dismissed.
that's
the
first
proposition.
the
second
proposition
is
that
if
you
do
have
to
reach
the
question
of
the
statutes
constitutionality
or
if
the
court
below
had
to
on
its
face
did
as
clearly
nothing
unconstitutional
statute
as
vague
or
overbroad.
mr.
david
w.
louisell
they
didn't
interpret
it
below
your
honor.
that
--
i
will
excuse
that,
i
mean
they
didn't
apply
it
to
the
facts.
you
will
note
from
the
opinion
of
the
court
below
on
page
89,
the
court
said
before
we
discuss
the
issues
presented
as
to
the
merits
of
this
controversy,
it
may
be
wise
to
state
what
is
not
involved,
at
the
top
of
page
89.
this
case
does
not
involve
in
any
way
an
appraisal
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
application
of
the
statutes
to
the
plaintiffs.
we
do
not
evaluate
whether
article
474
was
constitutionally
applied
to
these
plaintiff's
activity.
our
sole
concern
is
the
determination
of
whether
article
474
on
its
face
is
--
and
so
forth
unconstitutional.
mr.
david
w.
louisell
the
injunction
and
i
must
admit
it
is
couched
in
very
unusual
format.
the
injunction
comes
at
the
very
end
of
that
opinion
on
page
92
at
the
very
bottom
of
the
page.
mr.
david
w.
louisell
that
is
correct.
and
it
--
mr.
david
w.
louisell
that
is
all
we
have
by
way
of
a
judgment
in
this
case.
mr.
david
w.
louisell
and
that
is
why
it's
here,
that
is
the
appeal
was
taken.
mr.
david
w.
louisell
that
would
be
the
correct
procedure,
reverse
with
instructions
to
dismiss
the
complaint
as
utterly
a
non-existent
controversy.
mr.
david
w.
louisell
i
believe
--
yes
your
honor.
but,
it
would
be
--
mr.
david
w.
louisell
that
is
precisely
right,
and
i
think
that
can
be
shown
by
--
if
you
wish,
i
get
right
into
that.
i
might
just
mention
a
little
more
of
the
chronology
here
in
case
it
isn't
completely
clear,
the
point
i
wanted
to
stress
about
the
facts
is
that
no
state
official,
no
state
trooper,
no
sheriff,
no
city
policemen
did
anything
to
inhibit
these
people
coming
in
making
their
protest.
mr.
david
w.
louisell
may
i
just
state
the
exact
thesis
of
the
dismissal
logs
that
it
took
place
on
the
federal
enclave
and
was
not
even
within
the
jurisdiction.
mr.
david
w.
louisell
correct.
mr.
david
w.
louisell
well,
they
said
they
would
await
any
further
injunctive
order
until
a
meeting
of
the
texas
legislature,
which
legislature
has
convene
--
mr.
david
w.
louisell
but
they
also
said
that
plaintiffs
were
entitled
to
an
injunction.
mr.
david
w.
louisell
that
is
correct.
mr.
david
w.
louisell
precisely,
those
were
the
two
points
that
i
wish
to
emphasize.
now,
to
make
the
rest
of
the
chronology
very
brief,
remember
if
i
may
say
this
that
it
was
the
military
police
who
detain
these
plaintiffs,
and
it
was
only
after
they
had
detained
and
that
they
were
brought
into
the
presence
of
the
state
people
that
they
were
taken
by
the
state
people
to
the
jail
were
this
charge
which
it
hadn't
been
dismissed
because
of
the
federal
enclave,
certainly,
would
have
had
to
be
dismissed
for
the
reasons
already
suggested
from
the
bench.
they
were
release
on
bail.
their
attorney
promptly
came
and
got
them
release
on
bail,
and
it
was
on
december
21st
that
they
started
this
three-judge
suit.
on
february
13
as
i
already
mentioned,
all
these
criminal
charges
were
dismissed,
february
13,
1968.
on
february
15
therefore,
the
defendants,
the
appellants
here,
defendants
in
the
three-judge
suit
move
to
dismiss
the
suit
for
the
reasons
already
suggested
from
the
bench.
counsel
for
these
appellants
wanted
the
motion,
in
fact,
he
made
a
special
motion
to
have
his
motion
to
dismiss
her
at
first,
but
the
court
insisted
on
merging
the
motion
to
dismiss
with
a
hearing
on
the
merits
and
filed
the
opinion
that
we've
just
read
from
that
concluding
order
part
of
it
on
april
10th.
there
was
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
that
was
denied
a
so-called
the
addendum
opinion
written
and
the
appeal
was
taken
to
this
court.
mr.
david
w.
louisell
that
is
correct.
mr.
david
w.
louisell
i'm
saying
that
i
cannot
concede
how
that
complaint
would
make
a
charge
that
is
a
sustainable
charge
under
474.
mr.
david
w.
louisell
that's
right.
remember,
this
was
a
form
of
course
in
print,
it
looks
as
though
it
were
a
new
document,
but
it
was
a
form
merely
filled
in
by
the
justice
with
those
--
mr.
david
w.
louisell
well,
your
honor,
it
was
intended
undoubtedly
by
the
lay
justice
of
the
peace
to
be
in
charge,
but
you
don't
charge
a
person
with
disturbing
peace.
you
may
as
a
preliminary
matter
hoping
for
a
plea
of
guilty,
but
his
sustainable
legal
charge
would
have
to
be
in
the
language
that
you're
complaining
about,
that
they
did
viably
and
vociferously
in
a
public
place
and
so
forth.
just
like
you
don't
charge
a
man
with
murder,
you
charge
him
with
having
on
such
and
such
a
date.
mr.
david
w.
louisell
that
it
never
was
a
valid
criminal
charge.
mr.
david
w.
louisell
--
made
against
these
people.
mr.
david
w.
louisell
i'd
say
that
4
--
this
was
not
a
sustainable
legal
charge
under
474
in
my
judgment.
but
i
don't
suppose
that's
too
important
because
in
any
event,
this
was
dismissed.
this
was
dismissed
because
of
the
federal
enclave
proposition.
but
have
not
been
dismissed
your
honor
because
of
the
federal
enclave.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
justice
unless
it
where
amended
correctly
to
state
a
charge,
would
have
had
to
throw
it
all
upon
motion
of
the
defendants,
and
he
didn't
certainly
the
criminal
court
of
appeals
would've
thrown
that.
and
therefore
when
they
come
into
federal
court,
with
a
three-judge
suit,
there's
just
no
real
fight
of
any
true
kind
to
complain
about.
now,
if
i
may
come
to
the
substance
of
the
case
as
already
been
indicated
from
the
bench
from
a
legal
viewpoint,
this
really
merges
into
the
two
points
you
indicated
mr.
justice
fortas,
the
advisory
point
and
the
question
of
the
official
so-called
unconstitutionality
of
the
statute.
in
addition
to
the
cases
in
our
brief
on
the
advisory
point,
this
court
will
remember
just
of
the
last
term
that
comprehensive
review
of
the
whole
frothingham
problem
in
flast
against
cohen
where
the
court
had
occasioned
to
go,
i
think
to
the
philosophic
depths
of
the
whole
notion
of
justiciability
and
the
advisory
opinion
as
a
function
of
it.
and
in
addition
to
the
case
as
cited
to
in
the
brief,
i
invite
particular
attention
to
cases
as
old
as
the
famous
muskrat
case
and
even
older,
the
case
cited
in
the
flast
against
cohen
opinion,
california
against
the
san
pablo
railroad,
and
the
other
case
cited
in
the
flast
opinion.
but
if
really
seems
to
me,
it
really
seems
to
me
that
the
most
recent
cases
of
this
court
just
the
princess
anne
county
commission
case
decided
at
this
very
term
wherein
even
tending
order
was
set
aside
because
it
was
ex
parte
with
no
chance
for
an
advisory
exchange.
that
case
although
brought
up
by
the
appellees
i
think
is
excellent
authority
where
realistic
appraisal
of
whether
there
was
any
contest,
any
genuine
justiciable
controversy
before
the
federal
three-judge
court.
on
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute,
if
that
has
to
be
reached,
let
me
just
say
that
if
this
statute
is
on
constitution
when
he
brought
is
guilty
of
overbreadth
or
of
vagueness,
what
about
our
california
comparable
section
415
of
the
penal
code?
what
about
the
new
york's
section
on
disorderly
conduct
revised
as
recently
as
1965,
section
24.20
of
mckinney's
new
york
statute?
what
about
the
connecticut
statute
that
is
set
forth
in
detail
in
the
case
we
cite,
the
case
of
barber
against
kinsella?
what
about
the
minnesota
statute
to
pick
up
the
western
jurisdiction?
minnesota
statutes
annotated
section
609.72
even
the
american
high
institute
hasn't
been
able
to
do
anything
much
more
satisfactory
than
this
texas
language.
in
its
proposed
section
250.2
on
disorderly
conduct
makes
unreasonable
annoy
or
offensively
course
utterance
and
so
forth.
i
submit
in
confidence
that
a
condemnation
of
the
texas
statute
written
of
course
not
scientific
judge
and
not
so
many
decibels,
but
in
the
common
part
of
the
country,
it's
perfectly
beyond
the
path
on
its
face
as
unconstitutional.
if
it's
even
a
been
or
it
can
ever
it
is
applied
in
such
a
way
is
to
deny
people
their
first
amendment
rights
or
to
inhibit
in
any
realistic
sense,
not
only
this
texas
law,
but
federal
law
under
this
court's
holding
monroe
against
pape
provides
a
very
fine
remedy
--
mr.
david
w.
louisell
not
precisely
that
because
if
in
fact
the
threat
of
the
statute's
application
to
inhibit
first
amendment
rights,
lurked
in
the
background
like
in
the
dombrowski
case
--
mr.
david
w.
louisell
not
at
all.
in
that
case,
of
course,
there's
a
very
serious
basic
substantive
conflict
of
offering
a
free
speech
--
mr.
david
w.
louisell
that
is,
it
isn't
the
proper
suit.
mr.
david
w.
louisell
well,
i
don't
say
you
have
to
reach
that
question,
no.
but
if
you
do
reach
it,
i
do
say
the
answer
is
very
clear
and
i
think
that
could
a
situation
is
very
clearly
distinguishable,
there
as
i
read
the
opinion
of
this
court.
mr.
david
w.
louisell
well,
(voice
overlap)
the
krueger
case
has
gone
back
to
the
district
court
where
there
is
relief
--
mr.
david
w.
louisell
that
is
right.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
david
w.
louisell
may
it
please
the
court,
of
course,
the
situation
in
the
princess
anne
county
just
referred
to
by
counsel
was
that
there
was
an
extent
injunction
that
was
a
precedent
and
that
the
officials
were
relying
upon
to
prevent
another
meeting
before
this
court
struck
down
that
injunction.
in
submitting
this
case,
your
honors,
i
have
only
two
points
to
make
at
this
time.
far
from
sustaining
the
heavy
burden
of
showing
a
texas
policy
to
use
article
474
to
staple
speech,
i
don't
think
i
exaggerate
when
i
say
there's
hardly
any
showing
of
such
a
policy,
except
the
conclusory
statements
in
the
affidavits
that
their
rights
are
chilled
because
of
what
took
place.
mr.
david
w.
louisell
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
david
w.
louisell
what
if
that
was
chilled
to
any
extent
your
honor.
they
must
be
very
chillable
people.
mr.
david
w.
louisell
in
the
epperson
case
however
as
the
court
very
carefully
pointed
out,
it
was
from
a
state
court
where
the
trial
court
had
granted
the
relief,
where
the
appellate
court
of
the
state
wrote
that
two
sentence
opinion,
and
where
as
the
writer
of
this
court's
opinion
say
of
the
case
is
here
from
a
state
court
which
we
think
is
an
entirely
distinguishable
situation.
now
in
this
case,
there
is
no
suspicion,
there's
even
no
possibility
of
suspecting
racial
prejudice
in
the
case
at
bar
because
local
counsel
inform
me
all
the
persons
involved
were
white
people.
if
you
go
to
all
the
texas
cases
in
both
of
our
brief,
you
won't
find
i
don't
believe
your
honors,
one,
that
even
concerns
the
content
of
speech,
except
one
involving
cursing,
and
there
the
court
said,
isn't
enough
show
cursing
to
justify
a
conviction,
the
cursing
must
be
shown
to
have
done
--
have
been
done
in
a
manner
reasonably
calculated
to
disturb
the
peace.
i
think
we
can
almost
take.
i
don't
exaggerate
when
i
say
we
can
almost
take
judicial
notice
that
protesting,
including
protesting
about
vietnam
is
as
open,
uninhibited
at
the
university
of
texas
in
austin
as
it
is
in
berkley,
california.
mr.
david
w.
louisell
it
was
a
$400.00
bail
your
honor,
where
the
maximum
(voice
overlap)
punishment
--
mr.
david
w.
louisell
twice
as
much
and
of
course,
nobody
would
justify
that
your
honor.
no
sensible
person
would
stand
before
this
tribunal
and
justify
that.
when
you
take
into
account,
the
circumstances
though,
if
there
was
overreaction
here
your
honor,
the
tremendous
nerve-racking
circumstances
of
that
event,
will
that
be
likely
to
reoccur
again?
these
local
people,
a
lay
justice
of
the
peace,
and
if
there
is
that
kind
of
abuse,
it
is
with
pride
that
i
can
say
that
this
court
had
made
clear
the
right
to
a
remedy
under
the
civil
rights
act
in
monroe
against
pape.
mr.
david
w.
louisell
there
is
nothing
to
that
effect,
but
there
is
in
the
affidavits
of
the
sheriff
and
the
deputy
sheriffs
any
deny
–
denial
of
any
mistreatment.
(voice
overlap)
mr.
david
w.
louisell
i
don't
believe
that
those
words.
i
forget
exactly
to
whom
was
attributed
of
the
word
traitor,
but
i
don't
think
--
mr.
david
w.
louisell
for
that
reprehensible
conduct,
there
is
an
adequate
remedy
under
this
court's
decisions
in
monroe
against
pape,
but
the
remedy
isn't
your
honor
to
reach
out
and
declare
unconstitutional
statute
in
the
abstract.
if
this
--
if
the
court
below
is
right
about
474,
article
474
in
declaring
in
the
abstract
for
facial
unconstitutionality
so-called,
i
submit
to
this
court
as
far
as
i
can
find
every
disturbing
of
the
peace,
every
breach
of
the
peace
and
probably
every
disorderly
conduct
statute
in
this
country
would
fall.
can
society
afford
that?
this
free
speech
required
that.
mr.
david
w.
louisell
why,
no?
if
the
judge
is
being
willing
to
go
into
the
question,
the
lower
court
judge,
the
three-judge,
if
they
had
been
willing
to
go
into
it,
but
they
deliberately
said
we
won't
examine
into
the
application
of
the
statute
to
the
facts
here.
we
insist
upon
doing
this
in
the
abstract.
now
your
honor,
i
see
my
time
is
up
and
in
submitting
this
case,
i
just
want
to
say
this,
--
mr.
david
w.
louisell
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
louisell
i
represent
the
three
appellants;
the
sheriff,
the
justice
of
the
peace,
and
the
county
attorney
of
the
county
involved.
the
state
came
into
the
--
mr.
david
w.
louisell
the
state
of
texas
is
in
no
way
a
party.
the
attorney
general
as
the
senior
law
officer
of
the
state
in
view
of
the
nature
of
this
attack
on
the
statute
of
the
state
took
part
in
assisted
in
the
defense
of
these
three
appellants.
mr.
david
w.
louisell
yes
your
honor,
that
is
the
at
least
the
assistant
attorney
general,
the
act
of
trial
counsel
in
this
case
is
a
party
to
the
brief
in
this
court,
yes.
when
a
group
for
example
comes
to
a
classroom
door
or
window,
and
by
shrieky
and
raising
a
great
den
disrupts
that
class
with
the
purpose
of
doing
that;
is
that
free
speech?
your
honors,
that
is
the
thing
that
prevents
free
speech,
and
it
is
exactly
at
that
type
of
failure
that
474,
article
474
is
aimed
in
order
to
continue
a
civilization
that
will
make
free
speech.
mr.
david
w.
louisell
there
is
no
question.
if
their
allegations
however
deny
they
are
by
the
affidavits
of
the
sheriff
and
the
deputies
and
so
forth,
if
those
allegations
are
in
good
faith
allegations,
if
in
fact
they
are
true,
they
have
every
right
to
relief.
in
fact,
the
complaint
presumably
also
seeks
a
relief
in
dollars.
they
have
every
right
under
the
monroe
case,
if
there
is
any
truth
at
all
to
those
allegations.
and
i
wouldn't
for
a
moment
deny,
but
to
reach
out
and
declare
in
the
abstract
a
statute
is
unconstitutional
that
would
strike
down
every
other
statute
in
the
union
of
a
comparable
nature,
i
submit
is
not
in
the
interest
of
free
speech
in
any
possible
way.
mr.
david
w.
louisell
if
your
honors
please,
in
view
of
the
time
limits,
we
must
submit
the
matter
of
appealability
that
we
were
discussing
yesterday
on
our
supplemental
brief.
we
submit
that
it's
covered
there.
if
not
a
judgment
we
have
here
under
the
statute
a
reviewable
order.
i
might
only
say
that
the
appellees
themselves
in
their
motion
to
affirm
with
great
candor
acknowledge
this,
so
far
as
it's
relevant,
and
they
pointed
out
on
page
2
of
their
motion
to
affirm
that
under
reynolds
against
sims,
a
reapportionment
case,
they
had
no
doubt
about
the
appealability
of
the
order
here.
it
would
of
course
be
very
unfortunate
i
think
from
a
viewpoint
of
judicial
administration.
the
case
have
--
mr.
david
w.
louisell
well,
that's
--
mr.
david
w.
louisell
and
of
course
as
we
point
out
in
the
supplemental
brief
but
there
is,
is
in
the
last
paragraph
--
mr.
david
w.
louisell
--
of
the
court's
opinion.
your
honors,
it
seems
to
us
that
the
crux
of
this
case,
the
real
turning
point
when
it
might
have
gone
the
right
way
was
on
the
motion
by
the
appellants
to
dismiss
made
very
promptly
within
a
day
or
two
after
all
of
the
criminal
complaints
in
the
state
court
had
been
dismissed.
at
that
point,
we
submit
to
your
honors,
there
was
no
case
or
controversy.
anything
more
to
be
done
was
a
simple
matter
of
advice
and
advisory
opinion
and
from
the
beginning
of
this
nation
to
the
present
time,
the
teaching
of
this
court
is
there
was
no
occasion,
no
reason,
no
right
to
go
ahead
and
render
an
advisory
opinion.
the
court
insisted
on
so-called
using
the
phrase
“we
will
carry
this
motion
with
the
case.”
if
it
had
faced
up
to
the
motion
explicitly,
what
happened
might
not
have
happened.
now
remember,
if
i
may
say
as
far
as
dombrowski
goes
and
i
wish
there
were
time
for
a
full
review
of
it
although
there
has
been
so
much
rethinking
and
refreshing
by
the
court
in
any
event,
i
doubt
it
would
be
necessary.
but
far
from
the
facts
here
invoking
dombrowski
where
there
was
a
bona
fide
allegation
of
deliberate,
intentional,
none
of
good
faith
used
of
the
very
complicated
statute
to
effect
racial
repression
far
from
those
facts
being
involved
here,
and
even
assuming
every
disputed
fact
or
anything
that
we
can
imagine
was
disputed
here
in
favor
of
the
appellees,
this
was
a
one-shot
proposition.
this
wasn't
a
continuing
concert
of
effort
to
deprive
anybody
of
his
rights.
instead
of
dombrowski
being
controlling,
i
submit
to
you
there
are
controlling
words
in
cameron
against
johnson.
if
the
mere
possibility
of
erroneous
application
of
the
statute,
the
mere
possibility
of
such
erroneous
application
of
the
statute
does
not
amount
to
the
irreparable
injury
necessary
to
justify
a
disruption
of
orderly
state
procedure.
all
the
good
that
may
be
done
--
mr.
david
w.
louisell
i'm
saying
that
when
those
criminal
cases
were
dismissed
mr.
justice
white,
there
was
no
longer
a
case
or
controversy.
the
state
had
given
up
every
effort.
there
was
no
reason
to
go
ahead
with
the
federal
three-judge
case.
mr.
david
w.
louisell
i
would
still
say
that
it
wasn't
the
type
of
situation,
but
with
the
dismissal
any
pretense
of
excuse
--
mr.
david
w.
louisell
within
golden
of
course
and
the
necessary
or
the
necessary
distinction
between
the
declaratory
judgment
and
injunction
thinking,
i
invoke
all
that.
but
even
within
golden,
i
would
say
would
confirm,
make
more
explicit
of
what
i've
said
about
the
applicability
of
cameron
against
johnson.
mr.
david
w.
louisell
if
there
were
a
genuine
position
to
that
effect,
there
might
be
within
the
doctrine
of
golden
from
dombrowski
through
golden,
there
might
have
been.
but
there
was
nothing
here
far
from
meeting
the
strong
requirement
of
the
very
words
of
dombrowski.
there
wasn't
even
a
serious
claim
that
there
was
any
concerted
effort
to
keep
--
mr.
david
w.
louisell
well,
if
there
were
a
bona
fide
--
if
there
were
a
real
showing,
a
real
position
that
they
were
so
inhibited
by
the
statute;
that
would
be
one
thing,
but
i
want
to
come
to
that
and
show
that
the
statute
has
construed
never
in
texas
had
been
attempted
to
reach
the
content
of
the
speech.
it
was
only
a
method
of
controlling
disturbance
in
the
historical
meaning
of
disorderly
conduct
statutes.
mr.
david
w.
louisell
there
was
an
actual
allegation
of
deterrence,
but
i
submit
there's
absolutely
nothing,
but
for
narrow,
conslusary
mere
allegation.
now,
we
all
know
even
from
the
view
point
of
the
strongest
support
of
the
dombrowski
philosophy,
dombrowski
is
strong
medicine
in
the
federal
state
relationship
and
i
respectfully
submit
that
unless
taken
according
to
prescription,
strong
medicine
is
poison.
but
giving
to
the
claims
of
the
appellees
every
possible
intend
and
then
every
assumption.
mr.
justice
white,
if
it's
true
that
they
were
being
kept
out
of
the
county
by
a
concert
of
action
between
these
people,
wasn't
the
remedy
to
grant
an
injunction
against
that
sort
of
an
abuse
rather
than
to
reach
out
and
declare
unconstitutional,
a
conventional
orthodox
disorderly
conduct
statute?
mr.
david
w.
louisell
the
whole
statute.
mr.
david
w.
louisell
at
one
point,
they
seem
to
be
emphasizing
one
part
of
it.
mr.
david
w.
louisell
but
the
net
conclusion
is
in
the
assumption
among
the
lower
courts
of
texas
apparently
is
the
justices
that
all
of
474
has
gone.
mr.
david
w.
louisell
you
can't
tell
the
precise
notion
the
court
had
in
mind.
mr.
david
w.
louisell
but
they
did
say
entitlement
to
injunctive
relief.
i
want
to
reserve
a
few
minutes
so
i
would
just
say
now
that
of
course
historically,
the
purpose
of
this
statute
i
supposed
was
to
meet
the
conventional
types
of
disorder,
things
on
the
street,
disturbances
in
church
and
so
forth.
today,
the
need
for
this
kind
of
a
statute
is
the
kind
of
a
situation
where
a
mob
may
come
to
a
school
room,
a
classroom,
and
screech
and
shout
so
as
to
disrupt.
your
honors,
that
has
nothing
more
to
do
with
free
speech
than
the
fact
that
it
involves
the
noise
from
the
vocal
chords.
mr.
david
w.
louisell
of
course,
they
didn't
direct
themselves
to
that
specifically,
but
in
the
final
conclusion
of
the
court,
the
whole
statute
went.
mr.
david
w.
louisell
no
exceptions
to
the
condemnation.
mr.
david
w.
louisell
they
did
say
that.
well
of
course,
the
next
session
of
the
legislature
met
and
adjourned
without
taking
any
action
as
we
point
out
in
our
supplemental
brief.
mr.
david
w.
louisell
that
is
--
mr.
david
w.
louisell
there
is
the
concluding
paragraph
and
of
course,
if
we
did
have--
mr.
david
w.
louisell
--
if
the
court
had
been
obedient
to
the
notion
that
your
honor
just
put,
we
would
have
a
specific
injunction.
but
you
can
go
to
the
whole
opinion
of
the
court
including
the
so-called
addendum
opinion
to
see
the
completeness
of
the
condemnation
of
section
474.
mr.
david
w.
louisell
if
the
court
please
--
mr.
david
w.
louisell
before
i
forget,
i
just
wanted
to
point
out
all
that
this
court
has
done
to
make
freedom
of
speech
really
viable
when
it
has
an
orderly
procedure
before
it
as
contrasted
with
what
went
on
here,
i
simply
refer
to
your
own
recent
decision
in
the
bachelor
case
for
maryland.
and
if
i
may
add
two
california
cases,
certainly
a
court
trying
to
be
obedient
to
your
teaching
on
free
speech,
they
were
too
late
to
get
into
the
brief.
these
case
has
shown
how
you
don't
reach
out
to
strike
down
the
california
disorderly
conduct
statute
because
you
got
to
grant
some
kind
of
relief,
in
re
cay
in
1
california
3rd
930,
in
re
bushman,
1
california
3rd
767.
now
the
one
thing
that
mr.
justice
stewart
directed
himself
to
us
all
i
will
have
time
to
comment
upon,
but
i
would
like
to
call
your
honors'
attention
to
the
fact
that
we're
not
dealing
here
with
rule
65
that
uses
the
phraseology
preliminary
injunction,
temporary
restraining
order
and
permanent
injunction.
we're
dealing
with
section
1253,
an
order
fortunately,
i
need
to
take
your
honor
if
even
i
had
a
time
on
this,
your
honors
had
occasion
carefully
to
rethink
this
problem
in
the
goldstein
case.
in
the
cole
against
richardson
proposition,
that
was
referred
to
from
the
bench
yesterday,
that
as
i
understand
it
from
the
concurring
opinion,
there
was
only
very
brief
per
curiam
order
and
the
dissenting
opinion,
in
that
case,
the
matter
was
one
of
mootness.
there
was
no
possible
claim
of
mootness
here
your
honors.
mr.
david
w.
louisell
but
wouldn't
it
be
a
very
serious
commentary
on
judicial
administration
if
an
opinion
that
is
so
effective
but
for
mr.
justice
black's
restraining
order,
his
stay
of
mandate
that
is
so
effective
as
a
practical
matter
and
remember,
there's
no
other
review
except
to
this
court
--
mr.
david
w.
louisell
an
outrageous
situation
and
also
i
invoke,
i
invite
the
attention
of
your
honor
to
the
fact
that
you
can't
blame
counsel
for
the
appellants
or
for
appellees
for
that
matter
because
the
very
last
sentence
of
rule
58
provides
“attorney
shall
not
submit
forms
of
judgment
except
upon
direction
of
the
court,
and
these
direction
shall
not
be
given
as
a
matter
of
course.
”
i
have
to
leave
it
to
the
court
to
find
a
way
of
avoiding
the
continuation
of
a
reprehensible
order
that's
operating
de
facto
as
an
advisory
opinion
and
arrest
the
processes
of
enforcing
the
law
in
the
state.
something
has
to
be
done
or
the
situation
will
become
impossible.
mr.
david
w.
louisell
yes.
mr.
david
w.
louisell
hopefully,
certainly
it
would.
mr.
david
w.
louisell
in
the
appendix
your
honor,
and
i
again
call
your
attention
to
the
fact
that
in
the
docket
entries,
it
is
referred
to
as
a
judgment.
mr.
david
w.
louisell
you
must
turn
to
the
last
paragraph
of
the
opinion.
you
don't
find
as
i
said
yesterday,
you
do
not
find
any
separately
entered
document.
rule
58
was
again
violated
--
mr.
david
w.
louisell
but
your
honors
--
mr.
david
w.
louisell
you
will
remember
in
how
many
instances,
in
fact
the
very
rules
provide
that
if
findings
of
fact
and
conclusions
are
embraced
within
an
opinion
you
can
use
that
--
mr.
david
w.
louisell
now,
if
you
can
substance
a
judgment
is
embraced
within
a
form
of
words
concluding
an
opinion,
even
though
it
isn't
entered
as
the
rule
requires
on
a
separate
piece
of
paper,
we
respectfully
submit
it
can
constitute
at
least,
i
submit
this
court
should
refrain.
mr.
david
w.
louisell
no,
and
i
think
--
of
course,
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
case
at
that
stage
but
the
attorney
general's
office
--
mr.
david
w.
louisell
yes.
the
argument
of
first
appeal,
but
the
attorney
--
mr.
david
w.
louisell
to
my
knowledge,
no.
but
your
honors
will
note
again
the
last
sentence
of
rule
58,
this
is
a
matter
that's
left
to
the
court
and
the
court
has
never
entered
what
it
should
have
done
rule
58,
but
that
is
--
mr.
david
w.
louisell
that
isn't
the
question
as
we
respectfully
submit
the
question
issue,
mr.
justice
douglas.
the
question
is
there
any
kind
of
an
order
under
1253
of
the
judicial
code.
mr.
david
w.
louisell
the
language
of
1253
is
not
in
terms
of
a
preliminary
injunction.
it
is
an
interlocutory
order
granting
or
denying
relief.
mr.
david
w.
louisell
there
is,
the
explicit
provision
that
the
court
stay
expires
upon
the
termination
of
the
next
session
of
the
state
legislature.
mr.
david
w.
louisell
the
stay
of
what
the
court
conceived
out
as
its
injunction.
mr.
david
w.
louisell
your
honor,
words
are
words,
owe
to
distinguish
the
reality
of
things,
criteria
--
mr.
david
w.
louisell
the
whole
problem
of
an
establishment
of
a
contempt
of
course
would
be
a
very
difficult
thing,
but
with
the
clear
intend,
with
the
intention
that
is
deducible
from
the
words
of
the
opinion,
i
would
say
it's
conceivable
in
any,
you
have
being
subject
to
a
contempt
order
is
not
the
definition
of
section
1253
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
david
w.
louisell
yes,
but
any
--
mr.
david
w.
louisell
we
have
what
the
judge
intended
to
embrace
within
his
opinion
as
an
order.
however,
it
had
to
--
such
a
thing
was
done.
