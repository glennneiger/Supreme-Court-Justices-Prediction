mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
in
the
essence
what
counsel
was
indicating
when
you
said
that
this
statute
was
not
applicable,
was
that
my
clients
were
not
guilty
of
violating
the
statute,
and
of
course,
that's
clear.
it
not
been
has
much
to
do
with
the
issue
but
i
gather
that's
what
he
was
saying,
which
brings
us
to
what
this
lawsuit
is
all
about,
the
university
committee
and
the
named
plaintiffs
feeling
that
there
was
the
chilling
effect
that
this
court
has
spoken
up
in
similar
type
cases.
a
chilling
effect
on
the
exercise
of
their
first
amendment
rights,
they
sued
in
the
court
below
and
the
three-judge
court
was
convened.
they
asked
for
three
things
essentially,
declaratory
relief
that
article
474
was
basically
invalid.
second
--
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
no
sir
--
oh,
before
it
was
concluded
i'm
sorry.
the
underlying
complaints
were
dismissed
after
the
three-judge
court
had
been
convened
and
the
manner
was
noticed
for
hearing.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
but
before
we
actually
got
before
the
court
for
our
hearing.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
by
motion
(voice
overlap)
by
motion,
yes
sir.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
the
same
way
that
the
three-judge
court
justified
it
with
emphasis
if
i
may.
the
three-judge
court
found
based
upon
uncontroverted
evidence
before
it
in
this
case
in
the
form
of
agreed,
a
testimony
in
a
form
of
agreed
affidavits
and
if
the
people
were
in
court
so
testified,
this
is
what
they
testified
to.
not
only
the
three
plaintiffs,
but
the
two
appellants
who
were
a
part
of
the
party
of
seven
represented
to
the
court
under
oath
that
they
had
felt
the
chilling
effect
of
these
prosecutions
and
worse
and
had
seized
all
activities
in
behalf
of
the
university
committee
to
end
the
war
in
vietnam
that
they
knew
others
who
had
done
so
and
it
was
all
for
this
reason
that
the
court
said
we
do
have
a
not
just
a
broad
curtailment
of
activities,
but
a
suspension
of
expression
altogether,
and
went
on
to
find
that
the
dispute
was
the
liable,
a
very
liable
because
here
people,
we're
saying
to
the
court
were
no
longer
taking
part
in
these
activities
that
we
have
before.
we
were
handled
in
the
way
we
were
handled
up
in
bell
county.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
there
was
a
suggestion
in
two
ways;
one,
in
the
pattern
of
a
conduct
of
at
least
two
of
the
defendants
--
i'm
sorry,
the
appellants
here
who
were
the
defendants
below.
the
sheriff
and
the
justice
of
the
peace
that
well,
to
put
bluntly
the
sheriff
said
in
the
record
that,
you
folks
get
out
of
my
county
and
don't
come
back,
we
don't
like
people
like
you
around
here.
the
jp
said,
the
justice
of
the
peace
said,
when
the
people
come
before
him,
we
don't
like
traitors
in
this
county
and
i'm
setting
a
$500.00-bond
on
your
case
although
the
maximum
fine
was
$200.00
to
make
sure
that
you
come
back
because
i
want
to
try
this
case.
there
are
other
matters
--
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
well,
that
particular
part
collapse,
but
the
court
--
but
you
were
asking
about
any
continuing
threat,
and
here,
they're
telling
them
don't
come
back.
if
you
do,
we're
in
effect
i
think
--
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
there's
no
evidence
that
any
--
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
well,
the
people
say
they
are
not
going
to
demonstrate
in
bell
county
as
long
as
the
sheriff
acts
like
he
does
and
the
jp
puts
the
on
the
$500.00
invokes
the
statutes
the
counsel
now
tells
the
court
we're
in
no
manner
guilty
of,
and
that's
the
thrust
of
their
basis
of
saying
that
they
are
therefore
not.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
no
sir,
declaratory
judgment
that
--
may
i
preface
to
that
answer
by
saying
actually
the
court
i
think
has
not
--
the
court
below
has
not
issued
either
declaratory
judgment
or
an
injunction.
they
have
said
in
an
opinion
that
we
are
entitled
to
it,
but
there's
been
--
they've
state
their
mandate,
pending
the
--
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
well,
i
mentioned
that
it
--
at
the
beginning
of
my
motion
to
affirm,
but
since
it
has
been
used
in
other
this
similar
type
thing
has
happened
in
particularly
some
reapportionment
cases,
i
figure
that
it
was
probably
fine
when
the
court
kind
of
thought
so
too.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
there's
the
opinion
--
we
have
not
entered
any
kind
of
order
of
injunction.
there's
no
language
agreed
upon
as
to
some
sort
of
order
that
would
follow
the
opinion.
the
reason
that
the
court
did
that,
it
sets
out
they
state
their
mandate
because
the
legislature
was
coming
into
session.
they
wanted
to
give
the
texas
legislature
a
chance
to
work
on
the
statute.
then,
the
legislature
it
happened
almost
coincidentally.
it
met
in
special
session
as
distinguished
from
regular
session
and
adjourned
without
taking
any
action
because
of
the
limited
nature
of
that
section.
before
then
we
could
go
back
to
the
three-judge
court
for
any
further
action,
papers
where
filed
in
this
court
and
the
mandate
was
state
further.
and
so,
that's
the
situation
as
far
as
the
outstanding
nature
of
any
kind
of
order,
there
just
isn't
any
way
we
have
the
opinion
and
it's
been
state,
the
mandate
was
state
first
by
the
court
below
would
now
by
this
court.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
well,
though
i
think
there's
more
to
it.
there's
more
to
this
case
than
that.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
i'm
satisfied
that
the
court
below
took
into
consideration,
perhaps
the
good
faith
of
even
the
dismissal
of
the
complaints
for
example.
you
see,
there
is
absolutely
no
evidence
in
this
record
that
these
events
did
in
fact
take
place
on
what
is
now
described
as
a
federal
enclave.
there
is
simply
no
evidence
that
that's
so.
in
fact,
circumstantially
is
if
counsel
says,
the
military
police
first
put
their
hands
on
the
protesters
and
then
delivered
them
into
the
hands
of
the
deputy
sheriff
while
still
on
a
college
campus
suggest
it,
maybe
it
wasn't
truly
on
the
federal
enclave
where
criminal
jurisdiction
have
been
ceded.
and
so
i
say
first
that
i
think
the
court
below
may
be
looked
at
the
timing
of
the
filing
of
a
motion
to
dismiss
and
the
grounds
of
the
motion
to
dismiss
and
the
fact
that
there
was
no
evidence
in
support
of
it,
plus
the
court
obviously
looked
to
the
things
that
i'm
suggesting
should
be
looked
to
the
continuing
suspension
by
these
persons
of
their
own
activities
in
bell
county,
particularly.
and
i
think
it
ought
to
be
said
about
bell
county
that
housing
or
being
the
home
as
it
is
all
fort
hood
and
being
a
military
installation,
this
particular
committee
that
i
represent
looks
upon
it
as
a
proper
place
in
which
to
spread
its
views,
and
so,
it
is
more
than
just
borrowing
or
these
people
feeling
they
can't
go
to
bell
county
but
the
bell
county
is
a
place
that
they
think
they
ought
to
be,
as
distinguished
from
even
some
of
the
adjoining
counties,
it
is
of
special
significance
to
the
--
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
it's
the
--
it
no,
it
is
not
the
only
one.
it
is
the
general
statute
--
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
well,
we
allege
that
that's
what
we
involved
and
the
appellants
here
denied
in
their
answer
that
the
474
was
unconstitutional
and
we
stipulated
in
that
stipulation
that
what
was
in
issue
was
article
474.
all
of
which,
it
was
raised
before
the
three-judge
court
on
the
motion
to
a
new
trial
analyzed
by
a
three-judge
court
and
the
three-judge
court
says
clearly,
we've
been
litigate
in
article
474
here,
we
would
have
been
here
to
start
with.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
no
sir.
but
i
want
to
answer
the
other
question
because
behind
article
474,
there
are
other
statutes
that
may
be
said
to
relate
to
breach
of
peace
but
this
is
the
one
that
is
--
has
the
short
title,
disturbing
the
peace,
and
this
is
the
one
that
we've
all
agreed
that
was
raised
here
and
was
involved.
one
other
sort
of
technical
matter,
what
you
have
before
you
or
what
we
have
before
us,
it
was
dismissed
was
a
complaint
filed
by
the
sheriff
or
a
deputy
sheriff
before
the
justice
of
the
peace,
and
that
insofar
as
counsel
says
that
it
is
inadequate
to
allege
an
offense,
of
course
we
don't
stand
trial
necessarily
on
the
offense,
we
stand
trial
on
any
information
that
is
later
issued
by
the
county
attorney
based
upon
that
charge
has
been
found.
we
have
to
make
bond,
we
go
--
we
put
to
jail
on
the
charge
and
we
have
to
make
bond
to
be
release
from
the
charge.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
i'm
sorry?
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
right.
what's
specific
part
of
that
very
broad
and
multi-positive
--
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
the
justice
of
the
peace
in
this
instance,
the
same
justice
of
the
peace
who
made
--
who
--
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
to
the
--
no,
there's
--
yes.
there
is
an
appealed
novo,
i'm
sorry.
it
depends
on
the
amount
of
fine
as
to
which
direction
you
go.
let's
say
generally,
they
would
be
an
appeal
de
novo.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
well,
after
the
justice
of
the
peace
was
saying
what
he
had
done,
we
didn't
look
forward
to
a
trial
before
him.
he
said
it
to
as
soon
as
they
were
brought
before
him
that
he
didn't
like
traitors
in
his
county,
and
then
he
put
--
imposed
--
he
said
well,
you
can
plead
guilty
and
the
fine
would
be
$200.00
which
is
the
maximum
incidentally.
or
you
can
make
a
bond
of
$500.00.
and
when
our
plaintiffs
--
i'm
sorry,
when
the
appellees
who
are
plaintiffs
below
protested
that
that
was
rather
excessive,
he
said
well,
i
just
want
to
make
sure
you're
here
so
i
can
try
this
case.
i
want
to
be
--
they
did
not
believe
that
they
had
much
future
here
before
him.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
for
just
a
moment,
i
would
like
to
put
back
into
perspective
what
we
were
speaking
of
yesterday
afternoon.
these
events
occurred
on
december
12
within
nine
days.
the
plaintiffs
filed
a
complaint
in
the
three-judge
court
below
--
in
the
court
below,
thereafter
the
three-judge
court
was
convened.
about
60
days
after,
the
complaint
had
been
filed
the
events
occurred,
the
defendants
below,
the
law
enforcement
officers
in
bell
county
and
the
county
attorney
moved
to
dismissed
the
complaint.
now,
certainly
i
think
that
based
upon
the
allegations,
the
facts
that
were
later
shown
in
support
of
those
of
allegations
at
the
time
the
complaint
was
filed,
there
was
a
clear
case
or
controversy.
and
to
the
extent
that
it
is
argued
that
the
court
did
not
have
jurisdiction
certainly
at
that
point,
the
court
clearly
had
jurisdiction.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
i
don't
know
that
the
court
put
it
in
those
terms,
but
--
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
we
rely
for
immediacy
and
reality
on
the
fact
that
charges
that
the
disturbing
of
the
complaints
--
disturbing
of
the
peace
complaints
that
we're
filed
when
it
is
obvious
to
anyone
who
knows
anything
about
the
facts
that
there
was
no
chance
of
proven
any
guilt.
they
were
simply
--
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
yes,
but
that's
only
the
part
of
what
we
rely
on.
we
rely
upon
the
harassing
--
we
rely
upon
the
whole
course
of
conduct
in
bell
county
from
that
time
right
on
down
including
all
of
the
harassment,
the
handcuffing,
the
jailing,
the
frisking,
the
stripping,
the
threatening,
the
calling
of
traitors,
all
of
those
things
plus
the
comments
of
the
chief
of
police,
get
out
of
my
town
and
don't
come
back.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
oh,
yes
it
did.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
there's
no
evidence
of
that,
no
evidence
whatsoever,
one
way
or
another.
we
further
plead
below
that
the
statute
was
unconstitutional.
we
plead
this
acts
of
intimidation,
harassment
and
so
on
ask
for
injunctive
relief
against
them.
we
think,
i
guess
the
showing
of
what
the
purpose
of
the
university
committee
is,
and
the
chilling
effect
that
it
had
and
that
these
actions
--
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
i'm
not
sure
the
record
does
show.
the
record
shows
that
the
committee
has
it
its
purpose.
the
appearing
for
purposes
of
demonstration
any
place
within
the
vicinity
of
100
miles
of
the
university
where
any
representatives
of
the
administration
that
we're
promoting
the
foreign
policy
at
which
the
committee
opposed
would
appear
that
it
was
their
policy
to
do
so,
as
far
as
the
record
was
showing.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
that's
correct.
now,
what
we
think
the
defendants
really
argued
below
and
their
motion
says
was
a
motion
to
dismiss,
but
it
was
based
solely
--
it
was
directed
solely
to
the
dismissal
of
that
part
of
the
injunctive
--
on
the
prayer
which
sought
injunctive
relief
against
the
pending
charges.
the
motion
to
dismiss
was
not
specifically
directed
to
that
part
of
the
prayer
that
sought
the
permanent
relief
of
injunctive
relief,
of
restraining
enforcement
of
the
declaratory
judgment
directing
itself.
the
court
was
aware
of
that
and
pointed
out
that
it
was
perfectly
clear
in
the
court
below
that
they
no
longer
had
to
consider
our
prayer
for
temporary
relief
as
to
the
pending
charges
since
those
hadn't
been
dismissed.
the
court
went
on
to
say
and
we
think
quite
correctly
that
the
motion
to
dismiss
was
not
specifically
directed
to
the
ultimate
prayer
of
declaratory
judgment
or
for
permanent
injunction
against
enforcement
of
this
statute,
and
then
the
court
went
ahead
to
find
that
it
was
unconstitutional.
and
to
say
that
we
were
entitled
to
injunctive
relief,
but
as
i
pointed
out
yesterday
did
not
actually
issue
any
order
in
the
form
of
an
injunction.
now
in
connection
with
those
pending
charges
--
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
i
suppose
we're
dealing
in
semantics,
the
court
handed
down
an
opinion
in
which
it
said
it
detail
in,
the
plaintiffs
are
entitled
to
their
declaratory
judgment
and
injunctive
relief.
now,
following
that
there
has
never
been
any
kind
of
paper
entitled
judgment
--
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
oh,
yes.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
to
the
extent
that
it's
in
that
opinion,
there
is
a
judgment.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
yes
sir,
without
any
specificity
as
to
what
they
are
joined
from
doing
it.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
the
court
only
said
we
were
entitled
to
an
injunction.
they
are
not
actually
an
issue
and
i
think
that
--
frankly,
the
place
to
take
care
of
that
part
of
the
case
is
back
below
if
the
court
hopefully
affirms
and
remands
back
for
the
actual
preparation
(voice
overlap).
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
yes,
but
--
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
well,
no
sir.
i
don't
think
it's
wrong.
i
think
we've
still
shown
it
not
only
did
the
acts
have
a
chilling
effect,
but
to
completely
froze
all
the
speech
and
activity
and
expression,
and
that
we're
--
if
shown
however,
irreparable
injury
as
stated
in
dombrowski
and
also
in
zwickler.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
a
state
court
it's
conceivable
might
do
that,
and
that's
one
reason
i
say
we
think
that
we
need
to
take
that
up
with
the
court
below,
but
there's
no
assurance
that
the
defendant,
sheriff
gunn,
will
do
that
or
that
the
justice
of
the
peace
will
not
again
require
them
to
post
the
$500.00
bond
and
to
go
through
all
of
those
things
before
we
ever
get
to
a
court
of
record
who
would
be
aware
of
decisions
of
this
court
and
follow
them,
and
in
that
connection,
i
made
a
mistake
with
yesterday
as
i
want
to
correct.
i
indicated
an
answer
to
a
question,
i
actually
i
kind
of
volunteered
that
the
trial
in
a
jp
court
was
on
an
information
following
the
complaint,
it's
not
correct.
the
trial
in
the
county
court
is
on
the
information.
in
the
jp
court
is
tried
upon
a
complaint,
then
we're
entitled
to
appeal
de
novo
--
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
that
is
actually
appended
to,
yes
sir.
it's
in
the
record.
in
the
jp
court
from
which
if
convicted,
we
have
an
appeal
to
a
county
court;
in
county
court,
proceedings
about
information
--
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
the
information
would
not
come
into
play
until
we
appeal
to
the
county
court
in
where
we
have
our
trial
de
novo.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
oh,
i
think
the
question
really
is
after
the
charges
have
been
dismissed
whether
the
matter
became
moot,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
this
court's
very
recent
decision
in
carroll
versus
the
president
and
commissioners
of
princess
anne
answers
that
question
in
our
favor.
we
view
it
as
authority
for
us
rather
than
counsel
does
as
thought
it
for
them
for
there
clearly,
you
have
similar
situation
and
that
the
underlying
controversy
between
our
committee
and
its
members
and
the
law
enforcement
officers
in
bell
county
continues
to
exist.
there's
nothing
in
this
record
that
suggest
that
the
sheriff
of
bell
county
would
not
once
again
enforce
or
attempt
to
enforce
against
the
plaintiffs.
article
474,
if
they
went
back
up
there
and
anywhere
in
bell
county
and
to
the
contrary,
the
sheriff
has
said
don't
come
back
to
my
county,
i
don't
want
to
see
you
faces
here
again.
much
the
same
situation
that
existed
in
princess
anne
there,
there
was
a
temporary
injunction
at
issue
that
was
the
cause
of
the
chilling
effect
on
the
amendment
rights.
moreover,
another
case
referred
to
in
that
opinion
was
the
situation
in
--
to
the
situation
of
icc
orders
where
they
were
only
issued
for
a
short
time
and
then
could
be
reissued
and
in
that
fashion,
review
is
precluded.
i
say
to
the
court
is
not
a
thing
in
the
world
to
prevent
the
sheriff
and
the
county
attorney
from
doing
the
same
thing
here.
charges
as
they
did
and
then
when
we
get
to
the
proposition
that
we
were
trying
to
defend
our
case,
turned
around
and
dismiss
complaints
again
and
try
to
deny
us
any
kind
of
found
determination
that
this
statute
is
unconstitutional
and
should
be
in
forward.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
i
will
say
to
the
court
that
it
does
exist
(voice
overlap)
and
it
is
active
although
i
must
admit
the
record
does
not
show
anything.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
it
exists
as
an
approved
on
campus
group
at
the
university
of
texas.
it
continues
to
hold
meetings
in
the
university
areas,
it
continues
to
distribute.
i
don't
know
about
the
distribution
by
like
handbilling
but
through
the
mail
and
through
advertisements,
it
continues
to
state
its
positions
on
things
in
the
university
area.
for
whatever
its
worth,
i
again
emphasize
that
it
is
a
group
that
is
approved
an
all
campus
group
at
the
university
of
texas.
i'm
not
sure
how
much
time
i
have
made,
but
i'd
like
to
spend
that
talking
just
a
little
bit
about
article
474.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
no
sir,
there
are
not.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
they
are
in
the
affidavits,
yes
sir.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
the
court
below
rendered
the
main
opinion,
then
something
called
addendum
on
motion
for
new
trial,
but
those
are
the
only
two
papers
handed
down
by
the
three-judge
court.
and
whatever
actual
findings,
in
fact
there
are
or
in
one
or
another
by
those
opinions.
in
that
connection,
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
the
court
below
was
satisfied
from
the
evidence
through
affidavits
that
the
university
committee
members,
the
named
plaintiffs,
some
of
whom
were
not
members
of
the
university
committee,
but
rather
sympathizers,
supporters,
and
associates
that
all
of
them
had
seized
certainly
in
bell
county
any
type
of
activity,
peaceful
activity
designed
to
carry
out
the
purposes
of
the
committee.
one
or
two
of
the
plaintiffs
indicated
that
he
had
seized
all
activity
everywhere
because
he
said
this
was
a
state
statute
and
he
was
afraid
that
the
same
thing
would
happen
to
him
in
any
county
if
he
engage
in
similar
protest
activity
as
it
happened
in
the
bell
county
and
he
did
not
again
want
to
be
subjected
to
charges,
to
making
bonds
and
to
court
appearances
and
things
of
that
nature
and
accordingly,
he
had
seized
all
activities
by
way
of
freedom
of
expression.
article
474
i
think,
clearly
on
its
face
and
in
view
of
decisions
of
this
court
from
cantwell
versus
connecticut
to
ashton
versus
kentucky.
article
474
must
follow
because
of
that
phrase
in
there,
“loud
or
vociferous
language
or
indecent.”
whatever
it
is,
the
operative
things,
then
going
down
to
calculated
to
disturb
the
inhabitance
of
the
place
where
the
event
takes
place.
certainly,
1966
in
ashton
versus
kentucky,
in
almost
identical
terms,
calculated,
i
believe
was
there
said
calculated
to
create
a
disturbance
or
breach
of
peace
and
here,
we
have
calculated
to
disturb.
this
court
said
that
that
sort
of
a
standard,
at
least
wide
open,
the
standard
of
responsibility
and
involves
calculation
as
to
the
boiling
point
and
does
not
in
any
way
involved
in
appraisal
of
the
comments
per
se.
that's
the
same
fault
that
article
474
has.
it
is
vague
because
of
that
language.
it
will
leave
to
the
police
officer,
to
the
deputy
sheriff
a
determination
at
that
moment
as
to
whether
the
language
is
such
as
to
create
the
boiling
point
on
water
more
of
the
listeners
involved
and
it
is
overbroad
because
it
obviously
includes
expression.
therefore,
it
must
fall
under
terminiello
and
edwards
v.
cox.
it
is
a
combination
of
both
overbreadth
and
vagueness
and
as
we
think
essentially,
the
same
--
it
presents
the
same
type
of
problem
that
this
court
resolved
easily
in
the
cox
versus
louisiana
in
which
the
breach
of
the
peace
statute
there
was
condemned,
where
the
louisiana
court
had
held
that
it
was
--
it
meant
to
breach
of
the
peace
to
agitate,
to
disquiet,
to
arouse
from
a
state
of
repose
that
those
were
terms
were
both
vague
and
overly
broad,
and
that
they
would
sweep
within
their
scope,
permissible
activities
under
the
first
amendment.
the
state
here
that
tries
to
defend
article
474
by
saying
that
it
only
prohibits
or
proscribes
conducts
in
which
there
is
involved
so
great
in
amount
of
noise
that
is
calculated
to
disturb.
we
submit
that
that
is
not
a
saving
interpretation
at
all.
it
would
outlaw
practically
all
modern
demonstrations,
some
of
which
had
been
approved
by
this
court.
in
edwards
versus
south
carolina,
there
was
singing,
handclapping,
marching,
and
things
of
that
nature.
clearly,
a
lot
amount
of
noise
and
no
doubt
as
i
believe
the
record
shown
in
that
case,
there
were
some
people
disturbed.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
yes
sir.
edwards
v.
south
carolina
--
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
no,
but
we
don't
have
that
here.
these
events
in
case,
these
events
took
place
clearly
in
the
public
place.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
college
campus.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
well,
it
was
right
adjacent
to
the
parking
lot
--
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
not
in
the
particular
incidence
(voice
overlap)
or
where
there
was
a
public
program
in
some
30,000
other
people
or
various
attendants.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
this
campus
of
the
central
texas
college
near
collin,
texas.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
well,
i
don't
believe
the
records
shows,
but
i
assume
that
it
is.
it's
(voice
overlap)
private
sectarian
college.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
no,
it
is
not
a
private
sectarian.
i'm
satisfied
as
a
public
college
and
since
the
tax
money
are
there.
the
record
doesn't
show
of
any
of
that,
but
the
record
does
show
that
on
this
occasion,
there
were
some
30,000
people
there.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
i
think
in
this
instance
under
these
circumstances
that
these
plaintiffs
could
come
on
as
they
intended
to
do
what
merely
display
signs,
yes
sir.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
in
these
circumstances,
sir.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we
think
the
disposition
of
this
case
here
for
reasons
about
to
be
stated
is
rather
simple
matter
and
suggests
that
that
disposition
is
to
affirm
what
the
district
court
has
done
and
remand
for
further
proceedings
not
inconsistent
with
whatever
action
the
court
does
take.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
i
am
addressing
it
to
remanding
it
to
the
court
in
order
that
then
the
court
can
actually
enter
an
order
for
injunction
if
the
court
deems
it
now
appropriate
to
do
so.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
of
course,
the
real
problem
here
is
i
suggest
that
the
--
that
court
in
real
deference
to
the
legislature
of
the
state
of
texas
stayed
any
action
under
its
opinion
and
with
that
occurring,
counsel,
prevailing
counsel
has
just
the
practical
matter
is
not
going
to
try
to
bother
the
court
below
as
getting
some
kind
of
order.
we're
still
waiting
for
the
legislative
action.
and
may
i
--
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
well,
the
opinion
does
in
the
last
paragraph
say
that
--
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
--
we
are
entitled
--
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
we
are
entitled
to
declaratory.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
i
--
certainly,
that's
true.
may
i
however
clear
up
one
thing
that
arose
yesterday
as
to
whether
the
district
court's
own
suspension
of
its
order
later
somehow
became
effective
by
reason
of
a
legislature
meeting
and
adjourning.
what
actually
happened
was,
the
legislature
did
meet
on
june
4,
1968
in
special
session
that
was
scheduled
by
the
normal
course
of
events
to
adjourn
on
july
3.
in
the
meanwhile,
the
state,
the
appellants
here
applied
to
his
honor,
mr.
justice
black,
and
he
on
june
the
12
i
believe
entered
a
stay
order
which
in
effect
superseded
whatever
the
district
court's
stay
of
mandate
meant
and
actually,
we
are
still
today
under
that
stay
order.
i
want
to
discuss
what
counsel
says
is
the
crux
of
the
case
that
being
the
motion
to
dismiss
and
i'd
like
to
put
that
in
the
context,
if
i
may,
of
the
events
that
led
up
to
that.
this
particular
occurrence
was
on
december
the
12.
we
filed
our
complaint
by
the
21.
the
single-judge
granted
a
temporary
restraining
order
holding
things
in
status
quo.
we
also
filed
a
motion
for
preliminary
injunction
and
requesting
the
convening
of
the
three-judge
court.
in
january
2,
the
tro
was
extended
as
i
recall
by
agreement.
on
the
19,
the
defendant's
filed
an
answer
to
the
motion
for
injunction
joining
issue
on
our
allegations.
and
on
january
the
23,
the
tro
was
extended
to
february
the
23
which
was
also
the
date
of
the
hearing
set
for
the
three-judge
court.
so
by
january
of
23,
everybody
had
their
pleadings
in
order
and
the
three-judge
court
had
been
convened
and
the
application
for
the
preliminary
injunction
was
then
pending.
it
was
february
15,
some
two
or
three
weeks
later
that
for
the
first
time,
the
motion
to
dismiss
surfaced
and
was
called
to
the
attention
of
the
court
in
connection
with
a
contemporaneously
filed
motion
for
a
continuance
seeking
to
have
the
court
put
off
the
hearing
that
had
already
been
scheduled
on
the
pleadings
and
concentrate
only
on
the
motion
to
dismiss.
the
court
on
february
20,
three
days
before
the
previously
scheduled
hearing
entered
an
order
deferring
the
motion
to
dismiss
or
carrying
it
along
with
the
case
as
we
say
down
there
and
denying
the
motion
for
continuance.
and
then
on
the
23,
the
hearing
was
held
on
which
date
incidentally
and
for
the
first
time
the
defendant's
filed
any
character
of
proof,
this
being
in
the
form
of
affidavits
from
some
of
them
and
some
of
the
deputies.
i
think
and
submit
that
the
court
was
entitled
with
respect
to
the
motion
dismissed
to
be
very
suspicious
of
the
validity
of
the
good
faith,
coming
not
only
as
a
matter
of
time
when
it
did,
and
in
fact
as
i
recall,
the
presiding
judge,
judge
thornberry
raised
that
very
question
during
the
hearing
as
to
the
timing
of
that
motion.
if
you
thought
he
said,
if
you
thought
that
these
events
had
occurred
on
a
federal
enclave
over
which
the
state
had
no
jurisdiction,
why
have
you
waited
this
long
to
call
it
to
our
attention?
but
in
any
event,
the
motion
to
dismiss
if
the
court
please
is
directed
only
to
that
event.
the
motion
to
dismiss
is
limited
to
the
fact
that
the
--
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
it's
page
16
of
the
brown
appendix,
page
16.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
the
last
two
sentences,
the
defendants
would
show
the
court
that
no
useful
purpose
could
now
be
served
by
granting
an
injunction
to
prevent
the
prosecution
of
these
suits
because
the
same
no
longer
exists.
plaintiffs
can
asked
no
greater
relief
in
the
instant
case
than
that
the
complaints
heretofore
filed
be
dismissed
for
want
of
jurisdiction.
well
of
course,
we
can,
not
only
can
but
did
ask
for
more
relief
than
just
to
stop
to
pending
prosecutions
where
we
had
a
prayer
for
declaratory
judgment
that
the
statute
be
declared
unconstitutional.
we
had
a
prayer
for
preliminary
injunction
later
permanent
injunction.
we
have
a
prayer
for
general
relief
that
i
submit
is
so
broad
that
if
relief
could
be
granted,
we
could
still
ask
for
monetary
damages
for
the
action
vested
upon
the
appellees
here.
and
the
court
had
this
kind
of
evidence
before
it
too
which
i
think
this
court
can
easily
conclude
that
the
district
court
not
only
considered
but
was
impressed
by
it
to
justify
this
kind
of
evidence,
to
justify
the
sworn
testimony
in
the
sense
of
affidavits,
we
agreed
and
the
stipulation
that
those
affidavits
meant
that
those
people
given
the
affidavits
if
called
to
testify
would
testify
in
the
fashion
shown
on
the
affidavits,
this
was
all
done
by
agreement
for
the
convenience
of
the
court.
the
appellees
here,
the
three
young
men
who
were
handled
in
bell
county
as
they
were
and
other
affiance
called
as
witnesses
through
their
affidavits,
who
were
there
also
as
a
part
of
the
demonstration,
all
said
that
they
were
limiting
their
activities
in
the
committee
it's
peaceful
protest
that
they
would
not
return
to
bell
county,
that
they
would
not
engage
in
any
demonstrations
in
bell
county
and
some
said
elsewhere,
so
long
as
the
statute
was
being
used
in
the
fashion
that
it
was.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
well,
i
think
it's
an
expression
of
fear
maybe
not
or
maybe
it
was
stated
directly
to
the
statute
itself,
but
it
was
stated
in
terms
of
if
this
is
the
way
the
statute
--
if
people
can
be
charged
for
disturbing
the
peace
for
what
we've
done,
well
then,
we
are
not
going
to
do
it
until
something
is
done
about
the
statute.
the
point
that
i'm
trying
to
get
to
is
to
suggest
to
the
court
that
when
the
district
court
accepted
those
statements
not
only
by
the
appellees
but
by
their
witnesses
who
were
there
in
the
demonstration,
they
have
very
good
reason
for
accepting
him
and
believing
him
and
get
writing
relief
based
on
that
or
indicating
that
we
were
entitled
to
relief
based
on
that.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
we
did
not
allege
that
the
defendants,
the
appellants
here
had
previously
used
this
statute,
excuse
me.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
it's
actually
254.r.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
yes.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
yes,
it's
still
--
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
well,
i
thought
--
i
think
it
is
especially
in
this
case
where
our
attorney
general
--
where
the
attorney
general
appear
--
our
state
attorney
general
appears
in
the
case
--
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
--
a
part
of
the
state
of
texas.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
well,
but
he
is
in
effect
saying
as
he
did
in
the
pleadings
that
the
statute
was
valid,
that
the
events
that
occurred
there
were
the
disturbance
of
the
peace
and
he's
alleging
really
that
local
event
in
bell
county
was
proper
and
is
effect
for
the
state
of
texas
adapting
that
position.
i
think
the
court
was
entitled
to
consider
that.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
yes.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
we
contend
it
and
we
allege
that
what
was
happening
in
bell
county
which
is
a
focal
point
for
such
demonstrations
for
the
reason
that
counsel
pointed
out
was
deterring
the
exercise
of
free
speech
of
people
that
wanted
to
go
to
bell
county
to
demonstrate.
we
did
not
contend
that
the
same
thing
was
happening
in
other
parts
of
the
state
because
we
weren't
really
trying
that
that
all
of
these
are
true.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
actually
wanted
to
do?
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
we
alleged
what
the
university
committee
did
in
terms
of
not
only
activities
--
in
terms
of
its
activities,
demonstrations,
distribution
of
literature
-
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
and
said
that
it
had
been
--
if
various
individuals
handle
it
different
way,
some
individual
says
we
have
seized
all
activities,
other
said
we
have
seized
any
activity
in
bell
county,
we
will
not
go
back
to
killeen
in
bell
county
and
the
fort
hood
area.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
i
believe
it's
in
both.
we
allege
in
our
complaint
--
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
that
the
sole
purpose
of
these
activities
about
the
defendants
were
to
deter,
intimidate,
hinder,
prevent
plaintiffs
and
the
members
from
--
members
of
the
university
committee,
his
friends
and
supporters
from
exercising
the
rights
guaranteed.
we
say
unless
the
court
restrains
the
operation
and
enforcement
of
the
void
and
valid
unconstitutional
statute,
plaintiffs
and
members
of
the
committee
will
suffer
immediate
the
--
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
well,
we
say
as
long
as
the
charges
are
pending,
we
would
it
be
fearful
of
exercising
the
rights,
our
federal
rights
guaranteed
and
then
the
affidavits
come
along
and
say
that
they
have
indeed
ceased
activities
either
state
wide
in
the
event
of
some
of
the
parts
or
just
in
bell
county
in
the
case
of
others.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
the
details
are
in
the
affidavits
and
what
i
want
to
try
to
point
out
at
this
time
is
to
show
why
the
court
below
was
justified
in
accepting
those
statements
against
the
background
of
the
other
evidence
that
was
before
the
court,
what
counsel
labeled
yesterday
as
unfortunate
events.
some
of
those
unfortunate
events
included
the
following
based
on
the
evidence
that
was
before
the
court,
sheriff
gunn
himself
said
to
two
of
the
demonstrators
who
were
not
actually
handled,
who
were
not
arrested,
who
were
not
jailed
sue
granville
and
phillip
juvenville
get
out
of
my
county
and
don't
come
back,
don't
ever
want
to
see
your
faces
in
bell
county
again.
now
gunn
contrary
to
counsels'
suggested
yesterday
does
not
deny
having
made
those
statements.
he
denies
having
said
other
things
to
the
specific
appellees
here
in
and
out
of
the
jail
but
he
does
not
deny
in
his
affidavit
making
those
statements
to
sue
granville
and
phillip
juvenville.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
no,
we
do
not
allege
any
experience
in
any
other
counties.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
this
case
relates
solely
to
what
happened,
arises
solely
from
what
happened
in
the
bell
county.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
well,
it
occurs
to
me
that
if
the
statute
is
of
course
it
was
invalid
in
bell
county,
its
invalid
state
wide.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
and
it's
just
--
excuse
me,
it
just
happens
that
this
situation
arose
from
bell
county.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
well,
no
sir.
that's
exactly
another
threat
of
--
the
point
that's
made
throughout
these
affidavits.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
well,
may
i
comment
about
that?
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
i
don't
see
how
we
could.
we'd
have
to
allege
as
i
understanding
it
under
dombrowski
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional,
and
that
--
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
well,
we
say
it
was
used
on
this
occasion
and
that
they
were
threatening
us
in
effect
with
using
it
again
and
again
and
again
if
we
came
back.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
i
infer
that
from
all
of
these
events
that
happened.
the
sheriff's
saying
“don't
come
back,
we
don't
want
to
see
your
face
here
again.
“
the
other
things
that
--
i
have
to
call
to
the
court's
attention,
these
other
evidentiary
events
that
happened
at
fort
end
what
would
happen
in
the
future.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
after
the
--
i'm
sorry,
i
don't
get
your
timing
there,
after
the
court
handed
down
its
shall
we
say
opinion?
we
did
not
apply
because
the
court
said
we're
deferring
any
further
action
until
the
legislature
acts.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
the
legislature
met.
the
legislature
--
while
the
legislature
was
in
session,
mr.
justice
black
entered
a
stay
order
which
is
still
in
effect.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
we
will
--
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
we
will
appear
before
the
court
and
make
application
for
whatever
relief
then
appears
to
be
appropriate.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
we
think
frankly
that
the
declaration
of
the
statute
is
unconstitutional,
is
sufficient
to
preclude
any
other
bona
fide
prosecutions
under
the
statute.
we
believe
the
state
and
local
district
county
attorney
will
follow
the
law
if
it's
declared
unconstitutional,
they
won't
--
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
we
may
not
in
view
of
the
problems
that
--
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
well,
i
don't
suggest
we
were
not
interested.
i
say
we
may
not.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
we
may
not,
but
i
must
again
emphasize
this
point
that
i'm
trying
to
make
that
the
court
below
acted
very
properly
in
seeing
that
there
was
a
case
and
there
was
a
controversy
that
it
was
continuing,
that
it
was
very
live
because
of
what
the
appellees
said
as
to
restricting
their
activities,
and
if
they
were
justified
and
accepting
that
by
reason
of
what
had
happened
to
them
in
bell
county
and
what
was
threatened
would
reoccur
in
the
event,
they
went
back
to
bell
county.
i
have
indicated
what
the
sheriff
himself
said
when
they
were
taken
before
the
justice
of
the
peace.
he
greeted
them
under
the
evidence
of
this
case,
he
greeted
them
with
the
statement,
“we
don't
like
traitors
around
here.
”
and
he
said
--
he
says,
“you
can
plead
guilty,
you'd
fined
$200.00
or
you
can
plead
not
guilty
and
i'll
put
you
in
jail
until
you
can
make
$500.00
bond.
”
and
one
of
the
appellees
here
said
isn't
that
a
little
high?
and
he
said
“well
sure,
it's
high,
but
i
want
you
to
make
sure
you're
back
here
because
i
want
to
see
that
this
case
is
tried.
”
while
after
that
happened,
an
officer
of
the
law
is
there
in
jp's
office
and
he
confronts
one
of
the
appellees
and
he
is
toying
with
live
bullets
in
his
hands.
and
he
says,
“you
know
sonny,
i
shot
a
lot
of
mad
dogs
in
my
day
and
i
could
shoot
a
traitor,
i
could
shoot
a
traitor
and
never
give
it
a
thought.
it'd
be
just
like
shooting
a
mad
dog.
”
and
then
when
they
finally
get
moved
from
the
killeen
city
jail
and
to
be
taken
over
to
belton
community
or
town
some
15
or
20
miles
away
to
be
put
in
that
jail,
the
killeen
police
chief
tells
them,
“don't
come
back
here.
we
don't
like
your
kind
around
here
and
tell
your
university
of
texas
friends
the
same
thing
because
we
got
all
the
education
we
need
right
here
at
the
junior
college.
”
all
of
these
activities,
all
of
this
evidence,
the
whole
point
of
bringing
it
up
is
to
justify
what
the
court
below
found
was
a
live
controversy,
a
genuine
good
faith,
solid
based
statement
by
each
of
the
appellees
and
their
associates
that
they
were
no
longer
going
to
engage
in
demonstrations
because
this
is
what
happened
to
them
and
would
happen
to
them.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
well,
--
not
state
wide,
obviously
not
state
wide
but
this
--
sir?
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
well,
--
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
one
event
on
one
day
with
a
threat
of
what
would
happen
if
they
came
back
to
have
any
other
event
on
any
other
day.
i
don't
--
it's
occurs
to
me
that
we
should
not
be
required
to
keep
testing
the
statements
that
these
officers
had
made
in
order
to
have
standing
to
complaint
and
say
we're
being
put
up
on
and
we're
being
mistreated
and
we
can't
get
a
fair
trial
up
there
and
come
into
federal
courts
for
relief.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
i'll
accept
the
professor's
statement
on
that,
but
view
that
carefully
--
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
i'm
suggesting
to
the
court
that
we
have
definitely
shown
in
this
case
a
chilling
effect
by
reason
of
acts
of
conduct
that
happened
there
and
that
are
threatened
to
reoccur
every
time
any
of
these
people
or
their
associates
or
their
friends
and
supporters
ever
again
enter
bell
county
in
order
to
engage
in
a
peaceful
demonstration.
in
order
to
do
as
what
the
counsel
himself
said
to
the
court
yesterday
was
nothing
improper
about
their
protest
and
may
i
hark
right
back
to
the
business
about
the
president
of
the
united
states
and
that
to
show
that
not
only
does
this
evidence
show
that
any
other
time
they
went
up
there
for
any
other
purpose,
the
same
as
likely
to
reoccur,
but
also
to
suggest
that
to
protect
the
president
on
this
occasion,
all
that
was
necessary
was
to
once
whoever
the
officers
were
that
seized
them
and
detained
them
and
walked
them
out
to
the
edge
of
crowd
was
then
to
suggest
that
they
leave.
there
was
no
necessity
in
protecting
the
president.
for
these
deputy
sheriffs
then,
to
seize
them
and
handcuff
them
and
frisk
them
and
put
them
in
the
cars
and
take
them
down
to
the
killeen
jail
choking
them
along
the
way
while
they
were
down
there
and
engaging
in
this
further
activity
that
really
gave
rise
to
the
complaints.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
weren't
they
just
what
sir?
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
oh,
no.
no.
they
--
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
no.
the
sheriff
while
still
--
the
sheriff
--
while
an
evidence
shows,
the
sheriff
while
still
at
the
scene
told
his
deputy,
who
deputy
strange,
i
believe
his
name
is
and
deputy
strange
confirms
this
that
while
he
was
taking
the
appellees
into
the
killeen
jail,
he
was
in
communication
with
the
sheriff
and
told
him
to
file
disturbing
of
peace
complaints.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
well,
with
just
a
matter
of
minutes.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
no,
wait.
we
don't
think
at
this
--
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
if
the
statute
--
you're
suggesting
if
the
statute
were
constitutional?
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
well,
no.
we'd
have
to
complain
about
the
abuse
of
the
statute,
but
here
we're
complaining
about
both.
there's
unconstitutional
and
we
also
alleged
the
other
branch
of
dombrowski
too
below.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
that's
correct,
yes,
sir.
thank
you.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
in
the
essence
what
counsel
was
indicating
when
you
said
that
this
statute
was
not
applicable,
was
that
my
clients
were
not
guilty
of
violating
the
statute,
and
of
course,
that's
clear.
it
not
been
has
much
to
do
with
the
issue
but
i
gather
that's
what
he
was
saying,
which
brings
us
to
what
this
lawsuit
is
all
about,
the
university
committee
and
the
named
plaintiffs
feeling
that
there
was
the
chilling
effect
that
this
court
has
spoken
up
in
similar
type
cases.
a
chilling
effect
on
the
exercise
of
their
first
amendment
rights,
they
sued
in
the
court
below
and
the
three-judge
court
was
convened.
they
asked
for
three
things
essentially,
declaratory
relief
that
article
474
was
basically
invalid.
second
--
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
no
sir
--
oh,
before
it
was
concluded
i'm
sorry.
the
underlying
complaints
were
dismissed
after
the
three-judge
court
had
been
convened
and
the
manner
was
noticed
for
hearing.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
but
before
we
actually
got
before
the
court
for
our
hearing.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
by
motion
(voice
overlap)
by
motion,
yes
sir.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
the
same
way
that
the
three-judge
court
justified
it
with
emphasis
if
i
may.
the
three-judge
court
found
based
upon
uncontroverted
evidence
before
it
in
this
case
in
the
form
of
agreed,
a
testimony
in
a
form
of
agreed
affidavits
and
if
the
people
were
in
court
so
testified,
this
is
what
they
testified
to.
not
only
the
three
plaintiffs,
but
the
two
appellants
who
were
a
part
of
the
party
of
seven
represented
to
the
court
under
oath
that
they
had
felt
the
chilling
effect
of
these
prosecutions
and
worse
and
had
seized
all
activities
in
behalf
of
the
university
committee
to
end
the
war
in
vietnam
that
they
knew
others
who
had
done
so
and
it
was
all
for
this
reason
that
the
court
said
we
do
have
a
not
just
a
broad
curtailment
of
activities,
but
a
suspension
of
expression
altogether,
and
went
on
to
find
that
the
dispute
was
the
liable,
a
very
liable
because
here
people,
we're
saying
to
the
court
were
no
longer
taking
part
in
these
activities
that
we
have
before.
we
were
handled
in
the
way
we
were
handled
up
in
bell
county.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
there
was
a
suggestion
in
two
ways;
one,
in
the
pattern
of
a
conduct
of
at
least
two
of
the
defendants
--
i'm
sorry,
the
appellants
here
who
were
the
defendants
below.
the
sheriff
and
the
justice
of
the
peace
that
well,
to
put
bluntly
the
sheriff
said
in
the
record
that,
you
folks
get
out
of
my
county
and
don't
come
back,
we
don't
like
people
like
you
around
here.
the
jp
said,
the
justice
of
the
peace
said,
when
the
people
come
before
him,
we
don't
like
traitors
in
this
county
and
i'm
setting
a
$500.00-bond
on
your
case
although
the
maximum
fine
was
$200.00
to
make
sure
that
you
come
back
because
i
want
to
try
this
case.
there
are
other
matters
--
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
well,
that
particular
part
collapse,
but
the
court
--
but
you
were
asking
about
any
continuing
threat,
and
here,
they're
telling
them
don't
come
back.
if
you
do,
we're
in
effect
i
think
--
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
there's
no
evidence
that
any
--
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
well,
the
people
say
they
are
not
going
to
demonstrate
in
bell
county
as
long
as
the
sheriff
acts
like
he
does
and
the
jp
puts
the
on
the
$500.00
invokes
the
statutes
the
counsel
now
tells
the
court
we're
in
no
manner
guilty
of,
and
that's
the
thrust
of
their
basis
of
saying
that
they
are
therefore
not.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
no
sir,
declaratory
judgment
that
--
may
i
preface
to
that
answer
by
saying
actually
the
court
i
think
has
not
--
the
court
below
has
not
issued
either
declaratory
judgment
or
an
injunction.
they
have
said
in
an
opinion
that
we
are
entitled
to
it,
but
there's
been
--
they've
state
their
mandate,
pending
the
--
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
well,
i
mentioned
that
it
--
at
the
beginning
of
my
motion
to
affirm,
but
since
it
has
been
used
in
other
this
similar
type
thing
has
happened
in
particularly
some
reapportionment
cases,
i
figure
that
it
was
probably
fine
when
the
court
kind
of
thought
so
too.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
there's
the
opinion
--
we
have
not
entered
any
kind
of
order
of
injunction.
there's
no
language
agreed
upon
as
to
some
sort
of
order
that
would
follow
the
opinion.
the
reason
that
the
court
did
that,
it
sets
out
they
state
their
mandate
because
the
legislature
was
coming
into
session.
they
wanted
to
give
the
texas
legislature
a
chance
to
work
on
the
statute.
then,
the
legislature
it
happened
almost
coincidentally.
it
met
in
special
session
as
distinguished
from
regular
session
and
adjourned
without
taking
any
action
because
of
the
limited
nature
of
that
section.
before
then
we
could
go
back
to
the
three-judge
court
for
any
further
action,
papers
where
filed
in
this
court
and
the
mandate
was
state
further.
and
so,
that's
the
situation
as
far
as
the
outstanding
nature
of
any
kind
of
order,
there
just
isn't
any
way
we
have
the
opinion
and
it's
been
state,
the
mandate
was
state
first
by
the
court
below
would
now
by
this
court.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
well,
though
i
think
there's
more
to
it.
there's
more
to
this
case
than
that.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
i'm
satisfied
that
the
court
below
took
into
consideration,
perhaps
the
good
faith
of
even
the
dismissal
of
the
complaints
for
example.
you
see,
there
is
absolutely
no
evidence
in
this
record
that
these
events
did
in
fact
take
place
on
what
is
now
described
as
a
federal
enclave.
there
is
simply
no
evidence
that
that's
so.
in
fact,
circumstantially
is
if
counsel
says,
the
military
police
first
put
their
hands
on
the
protesters
and
then
delivered
them
into
the
hands
of
the
deputy
sheriff
while
still
on
a
college
campus
suggest
it,
maybe
it
wasn't
truly
on
the
federal
enclave
where
criminal
jurisdiction
have
been
ceded.
and
so
i
say
first
that
i
think
the
court
below
may
be
looked
at
the
timing
of
the
filing
of
a
motion
to
dismiss
and
the
grounds
of
the
motion
to
dismiss
and
the
fact
that
there
was
no
evidence
in
support
of
it,
plus
the
court
obviously
looked
to
the
things
that
i'm
suggesting
should
be
looked
to
the
continuing
suspension
by
these
persons
of
their
own
activities
in
bell
county,
particularly.
and
i
think
it
ought
to
be
said
about
bell
county
that
housing
or
being
the
home
as
it
is
all
fort
hood
and
being
a
military
installation,
this
particular
committee
that
i
represent
looks
upon
it
as
a
proper
place
in
which
to
spread
its
views,
and
so,
it
is
more
than
just
borrowing
or
these
people
feeling
they
can't
go
to
bell
county
but
the
bell
county
is
a
place
that
they
think
they
ought
to
be,
as
distinguished
from
even
some
of
the
adjoining
counties,
it
is
of
special
significance
to
the
--
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
it's
the
--
it
no,
it
is
not
the
only
one.
it
is
the
general
statute
--
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
well,
we
allege
that
that's
what
we
involved
and
the
appellants
here
denied
in
their
answer
that
the
474
was
unconstitutional
and
we
stipulated
in
that
stipulation
that
what
was
in
issue
was
article
474.
all
of
which,
it
was
raised
before
the
three-judge
court
on
the
motion
to
a
new
trial
analyzed
by
a
three-judge
court
and
the
three-judge
court
says
clearly,
we've
been
litigate
in
article
474
here,
we
would
have
been
here
to
start
with.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
no
sir.
but
i
want
to
answer
the
other
question
because
behind
article
474,
there
are
other
statutes
that
may
be
said
to
relate
to
breach
of
peace
but
this
is
the
one
that
is
--
has
the
short
title,
disturbing
the
peace,
and
this
is
the
one
that
we've
all
agreed
that
was
raised
here
and
was
involved.
one
other
sort
of
technical
matter,
what
you
have
before
you
or
what
we
have
before
us,
it
was
dismissed
was
a
complaint
filed
by
the
sheriff
or
a
deputy
sheriff
before
the
justice
of
the
peace,
and
that
insofar
as
counsel
says
that
it
is
inadequate
to
allege
an
offense,
of
course
we
don't
stand
trial
necessarily
on
the
offense,
we
stand
trial
on
any
information
that
is
later
issued
by
the
county
attorney
based
upon
that
charge
has
been
found.
we
have
to
make
bond,
we
go
--
we
put
to
jail
on
the
charge
and
we
have
to
make
bond
to
be
release
from
the
charge.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
i'm
sorry?
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
right.
what's
specific
part
of
that
very
broad
and
multi-positive
--
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
the
justice
of
the
peace
in
this
instance,
the
same
justice
of
the
peace
who
made
--
who
--
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
to
the
--
no,
there's
--
yes.
there
is
an
appealed
novo,
i'm
sorry.
it
depends
on
the
amount
of
fine
as
to
which
direction
you
go.
let's
say
generally,
they
would
be
an
appeal
de
novo.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
well,
after
the
justice
of
the
peace
was
saying
what
he
had
done,
we
didn't
look
forward
to
a
trial
before
him.
he
said
it
to
as
soon
as
they
were
brought
before
him
that
he
didn't
like
traitors
in
his
county,
and
then
he
put
--
imposed
--
he
said
well,
you
can
plead
guilty
and
the
fine
would
be
$200.00
which
is
the
maximum
incidentally.
or
you
can
make
a
bond
of
$500.00.
and
when
our
plaintiffs
--
i'm
sorry,
when
the
appellees
who
are
plaintiffs
below
protested
that
that
was
rather
excessive,
he
said
well,
i
just
want
to
make
sure
you're
here
so
i
can
try
this
case.
i
want
to
be
--
they
did
not
believe
that
they
had
much
future
here
before
him.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
for
just
a
moment,
i
would
like
to
put
back
into
perspective
what
we
were
speaking
of
yesterday
afternoon.
these
events
occurred
on
december
12
within
nine
days.
the
plaintiffs
filed
a
complaint
in
the
three-judge
court
below
--
in
the
court
below,
thereafter
the
three-judge
court
was
convened.
about
60
days
after,
the
complaint
had
been
filed
the
events
occurred,
the
defendants
below,
the
law
enforcement
officers
in
bell
county
and
the
county
attorney
moved
to
dismissed
the
complaint.
now,
certainly
i
think
that
based
upon
the
allegations,
the
facts
that
were
later
shown
in
support
of
those
of
allegations
at
the
time
the
complaint
was
filed,
there
was
a
clear
case
or
controversy.
and
to
the
extent
that
it
is
argued
that
the
court
did
not
have
jurisdiction
certainly
at
that
point,
the
court
clearly
had
jurisdiction.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
i
don't
know
that
the
court
put
it
in
those
terms,
but
--
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
we
rely
for
immediacy
and
reality
on
the
fact
that
charges
that
the
disturbing
of
the
complaints
--
disturbing
of
the
peace
complaints
that
we're
filed
when
it
is
obvious
to
anyone
who
knows
anything
about
the
facts
that
there
was
no
chance
of
proven
any
guilt.
they
were
simply
--
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
yes,
but
that's
only
the
part
of
what
we
rely
on.
we
rely
upon
the
harassing
--
we
rely
upon
the
whole
course
of
conduct
in
bell
county
from
that
time
right
on
down
including
all
of
the
harassment,
the
handcuffing,
the
jailing,
the
frisking,
the
stripping,
the
threatening,
the
calling
of
traitors,
all
of
those
things
plus
the
comments
of
the
chief
of
police,
get
out
of
my
town
and
don't
come
back.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
oh,
yes
it
did.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
there's
no
evidence
of
that,
no
evidence
whatsoever,
one
way
or
another.
we
further
plead
below
that
the
statute
was
unconstitutional.
we
plead
this
acts
of
intimidation,
harassment
and
so
on
ask
for
injunctive
relief
against
them.
we
think,
i
guess
the
showing
of
what
the
purpose
of
the
university
committee
is,
and
the
chilling
effect
that
it
had
and
that
these
actions
--
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
i'm
not
sure
the
record
does
show.
the
record
shows
that
the
committee
has
it
its
purpose.
the
appearing
for
purposes
of
demonstration
any
place
within
the
vicinity
of
100
miles
of
the
university
where
any
representatives
of
the
administration
that
we're
promoting
the
foreign
policy
at
which
the
committee
opposed
would
appear
that
it
was
their
policy
to
do
so,
as
far
as
the
record
was
showing.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
that's
correct.
now,
what
we
think
the
defendants
really
argued
below
and
their
motion
says
was
a
motion
to
dismiss,
but
it
was
based
solely
--
it
was
directed
solely
to
the
dismissal
of
that
part
of
the
injunctive
--
on
the
prayer
which
sought
injunctive
relief
against
the
pending
charges.
the
motion
to
dismiss
was
not
specifically
directed
to
that
part
of
the
prayer
that
sought
the
permanent
relief
of
injunctive
relief,
of
restraining
enforcement
of
the
declaratory
judgment
directing
itself.
the
court
was
aware
of
that
and
pointed
out
that
it
was
perfectly
clear
in
the
court
below
that
they
no
longer
had
to
consider
our
prayer
for
temporary
relief
as
to
the
pending
charges
since
those
hadn't
been
dismissed.
the
court
went
on
to
say
and
we
think
quite
correctly
that
the
motion
to
dismiss
was
not
specifically
directed
to
the
ultimate
prayer
of
declaratory
judgment
or
for
permanent
injunction
against
enforcement
of
this
statute,
and
then
the
court
went
ahead
to
find
that
it
was
unconstitutional.
and
to
say
that
we
were
entitled
to
injunctive
relief,
but
as
i
pointed
out
yesterday
did
not
actually
issue
any
order
in
the
form
of
an
injunction.
now
in
connection
with
those
pending
charges
--
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
i
suppose
we're
dealing
in
semantics,
the
court
handed
down
an
opinion
in
which
it
said
it
detail
in,
the
plaintiffs
are
entitled
to
their
declaratory
judgment
and
injunctive
relief.
now,
following
that
there
has
never
been
any
kind
of
paper
entitled
judgment
--
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
oh,
yes.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
to
the
extent
that
it's
in
that
opinion,
there
is
a
judgment.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
yes
sir,
without
any
specificity
as
to
what
they
are
joined
from
doing
it.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
the
court
only
said
we
were
entitled
to
an
injunction.
they
are
not
actually
an
issue
and
i
think
that
--
frankly,
the
place
to
take
care
of
that
part
of
the
case
is
back
below
if
the
court
hopefully
affirms
and
remands
back
for
the
actual
preparation
(voice
overlap).
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
yes,
but
--
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
well,
no
sir.
i
don't
think
it's
wrong.
i
think
we've
still
shown
it
not
only
did
the
acts
have
a
chilling
effect,
but
to
completely
froze
all
the
speech
and
activity
and
expression,
and
that
we're
--
if
shown
however,
irreparable
injury
as
stated
in
dombrowski
and
also
in
zwickler.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
a
state
court
it's
conceivable
might
do
that,
and
that's
one
reason
i
say
we
think
that
we
need
to
take
that
up
with
the
court
below,
but
there's
no
assurance
that
the
defendant,
sheriff
gunn,
will
do
that
or
that
the
justice
of
the
peace
will
not
again
require
them
to
post
the
$500.00
bond
and
to
go
through
all
of
those
things
before
we
ever
get
to
a
court
of
record
who
would
be
aware
of
decisions
of
this
court
and
follow
them,
and
in
that
connection,
i
made
a
mistake
with
yesterday
as
i
want
to
correct.
i
indicated
an
answer
to
a
question,
i
actually
i
kind
of
volunteered
that
the
trial
in
a
jp
court
was
on
an
information
following
the
complaint,
it's
not
correct.
the
trial
in
the
county
court
is
on
the
information.
in
the
jp
court
is
tried
upon
a
complaint,
then
we're
entitled
to
appeal
de
novo
--
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
that
is
actually
appended
to,
yes
sir.
it's
in
the
record.
in
the
jp
court
from
which
if
convicted,
we
have
an
appeal
to
a
county
court;
in
county
court,
proceedings
about
information
--
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
the
information
would
not
come
into
play
until
we
appeal
to
the
county
court
in
where
we
have
our
trial
de
novo.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
oh,
i
think
the
question
really
is
after
the
charges
have
been
dismissed
whether
the
matter
became
moot,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
this
court's
very
recent
decision
in
carroll
versus
the
president
and
commissioners
of
princess
anne
answers
that
question
in
our
favor.
we
view
it
as
authority
for
us
rather
than
counsel
does
as
thought
it
for
them
for
there
clearly,
you
have
similar
situation
and
that
the
underlying
controversy
between
our
committee
and
its
members
and
the
law
enforcement
officers
in
bell
county
continues
to
exist.
there's
nothing
in
this
record
that
suggest
that
the
sheriff
of
bell
county
would
not
once
again
enforce
or
attempt
to
enforce
against
the
plaintiffs.
article
474,
if
they
went
back
up
there
and
anywhere
in
bell
county
and
to
the
contrary,
the
sheriff
has
said
don't
come
back
to
my
county,
i
don't
want
to
see
you
faces
here
again.
much
the
same
situation
that
existed
in
princess
anne
there,
there
was
a
temporary
injunction
at
issue
that
was
the
cause
of
the
chilling
effect
on
the
amendment
rights.
moreover,
another
case
referred
to
in
that
opinion
was
the
situation
in
--
to
the
situation
of
icc
orders
where
they
were
only
issued
for
a
short
time
and
then
could
be
reissued
and
in
that
fashion,
review
is
precluded.
i
say
to
the
court
is
not
a
thing
in
the
world
to
prevent
the
sheriff
and
the
county
attorney
from
doing
the
same
thing
here.
charges
as
they
did
and
then
when
we
get
to
the
proposition
that
we
were
trying
to
defend
our
case,
turned
around
and
dismiss
complaints
again
and
try
to
deny
us
any
kind
of
found
determination
that
this
statute
is
unconstitutional
and
should
be
in
forward.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
i
will
say
to
the
court
that
it
does
exist
(voice
overlap)
and
it
is
active
although
i
must
admit
the
record
does
not
show
anything.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
it
exists
as
an
approved
on
campus
group
at
the
university
of
texas.
it
continues
to
hold
meetings
in
the
university
areas,
it
continues
to
distribute.
i
don't
know
about
the
distribution
by
like
handbilling
but
through
the
mail
and
through
advertisements,
it
continues
to
state
its
positions
on
things
in
the
university
area.
for
whatever
its
worth,
i
again
emphasize
that
it
is
a
group
that
is
approved
an
all
campus
group
at
the
university
of
texas.
i'm
not
sure
how
much
time
i
have
made,
but
i'd
like
to
spend
that
talking
just
a
little
bit
about
article
474.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
no
sir,
there
are
not.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
they
are
in
the
affidavits,
yes
sir.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
the
court
below
rendered
the
main
opinion,
then
something
called
addendum
on
motion
for
new
trial,
but
those
are
the
only
two
papers
handed
down
by
the
three-judge
court.
and
whatever
actual
findings,
in
fact
there
are
or
in
one
or
another
by
those
opinions.
in
that
connection,
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
the
court
below
was
satisfied
from
the
evidence
through
affidavits
that
the
university
committee
members,
the
named
plaintiffs,
some
of
whom
were
not
members
of
the
university
committee,
but
rather
sympathizers,
supporters,
and
associates
that
all
of
them
had
seized
certainly
in
bell
county
any
type
of
activity,
peaceful
activity
designed
to
carry
out
the
purposes
of
the
committee.
one
or
two
of
the
plaintiffs
indicated
that
he
had
seized
all
activity
everywhere
because
he
said
this
was
a
state
statute
and
he
was
afraid
that
the
same
thing
would
happen
to
him
in
any
county
if
he
engage
in
similar
protest
activity
as
it
happened
in
the
bell
county
and
he
did
not
again
want
to
be
subjected
to
charges,
to
making
bonds
and
to
court
appearances
and
things
of
that
nature
and
accordingly,
he
had
seized
all
activities
by
way
of
freedom
of
expression.
article
474
i
think,
clearly
on
its
face
and
in
view
of
decisions
of
this
court
from
cantwell
versus
connecticut
to
ashton
versus
kentucky.
article
474
must
follow
because
of
that
phrase
in
there,
“loud
or
vociferous
language
or
indecent.”
whatever
it
is,
the
operative
things,
then
going
down
to
calculated
to
disturb
the
inhabitance
of
the
place
where
the
event
takes
place.
certainly,
1966
in
ashton
versus
kentucky,
in
almost
identical
terms,
calculated,
i
believe
was
there
said
calculated
to
create
a
disturbance
or
breach
of
peace
and
here,
we
have
calculated
to
disturb.
this
court
said
that
that
sort
of
a
standard,
at
least
wide
open,
the
standard
of
responsibility
and
involves
calculation
as
to
the
boiling
point
and
does
not
in
any
way
involved
in
appraisal
of
the
comments
per
se.
that's
the
same
fault
that
article
474
has.
it
is
vague
because
of
that
language.
it
will
leave
to
the
police
officer,
to
the
deputy
sheriff
a
determination
at
that
moment
as
to
whether
the
language
is
such
as
to
create
the
boiling
point
on
water
more
of
the
listeners
involved
and
it
is
overbroad
because
it
obviously
includes
expression.
therefore,
it
must
fall
under
terminiello
and
edwards
v.
cox.
it
is
a
combination
of
both
overbreadth
and
vagueness
and
as
we
think
essentially,
the
same
--
it
presents
the
same
type
of
problem
that
this
court
resolved
easily
in
the
cox
versus
louisiana
in
which
the
breach
of
the
peace
statute
there
was
condemned,
where
the
louisiana
court
had
held
that
it
was
--
it
meant
to
breach
of
the
peace
to
agitate,
to
disquiet,
to
arouse
from
a
state
of
repose
that
those
were
terms
were
both
vague
and
overly
broad,
and
that
they
would
sweep
within
their
scope,
permissible
activities
under
the
first
amendment.
the
state
here
that
tries
to
defend
article
474
by
saying
that
it
only
prohibits
or
proscribes
conducts
in
which
there
is
involved
so
great
in
amount
of
noise
that
is
calculated
to
disturb.
we
submit
that
that
is
not
a
saving
interpretation
at
all.
it
would
outlaw
practically
all
modern
demonstrations,
some
of
which
had
been
approved
by
this
court.
in
edwards
versus
south
carolina,
there
was
singing,
handclapping,
marching,
and
things
of
that
nature.
clearly,
a
lot
amount
of
noise
and
no
doubt
as
i
believe
the
record
shown
in
that
case,
there
were
some
people
disturbed.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
yes
sir.
edwards
v.
south
carolina
--
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
no,
but
we
don't
have
that
here.
these
events
in
case,
these
events
took
place
clearly
in
the
public
place.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
college
campus.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
well,
it
was
right
adjacent
to
the
parking
lot
--
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
not
in
the
particular
incidence
(voice
overlap)
or
where
there
was
a
public
program
in
some
30,000
other
people
or
various
attendants.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
this
campus
of
the
central
texas
college
near
collin,
texas.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
well,
i
don't
believe
the
records
shows,
but
i
assume
that
it
is.
it's
(voice
overlap)
private
sectarian
college.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
no,
it
is
not
a
private
sectarian.
i'm
satisfied
as
a
public
college
and
since
the
tax
money
are
there.
the
record
doesn't
show
of
any
of
that,
but
the
record
does
show
that
on
this
occasion,
there
were
some
30,000
people
there.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
i
think
in
this
instance
under
these
circumstances
that
these
plaintiffs
could
come
on
as
they
intended
to
do
what
merely
display
signs,
yes
sir.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
in
these
circumstances,
sir.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we
think
the
disposition
of
this
case
here
for
reasons
about
to
be
stated
is
rather
simple
matter
and
suggests
that
that
disposition
is
to
affirm
what
the
district
court
has
done
and
remand
for
further
proceedings
not
inconsistent
with
whatever
action
the
court
does
take.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
i
am
addressing
it
to
remanding
it
to
the
court
in
order
that
then
the
court
can
actually
enter
an
order
for
injunction
if
the
court
deems
it
now
appropriate
to
do
so.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
of
course,
the
real
problem
here
is
i
suggest
that
the
--
that
court
in
real
deference
to
the
legislature
of
the
state
of
texas
stayed
any
action
under
its
opinion
and
with
that
occurring,
counsel,
prevailing
counsel
has
just
the
practical
matter
is
not
going
to
try
to
bother
the
court
below
as
getting
some
kind
of
order.
we're
still
waiting
for
the
legislative
action.
and
may
i
--
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
well,
the
opinion
does
in
the
last
paragraph
say
that
--
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
--
we
are
entitled
--
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
we
are
entitled
to
declaratory.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
i
--
certainly,
that's
true.
may
i
however
clear
up
one
thing
that
arose
yesterday
as
to
whether
the
district
court's
own
suspension
of
its
order
later
somehow
became
effective
by
reason
of
a
legislature
meeting
and
adjourning.
what
actually
happened
was,
the
legislature
did
meet
on
june
4,
1968
in
special
session
that
was
scheduled
by
the
normal
course
of
events
to
adjourn
on
july
3.
in
the
meanwhile,
the
state,
the
appellants
here
applied
to
his
honor,
mr.
justice
black,
and
he
on
june
the
12
i
believe
entered
a
stay
order
which
in
effect
superseded
whatever
the
district
court's
stay
of
mandate
meant
and
actually,
we
are
still
today
under
that
stay
order.
i
want
to
discuss
what
counsel
says
is
the
crux
of
the
case
that
being
the
motion
to
dismiss
and
i'd
like
to
put
that
in
the
context,
if
i
may,
of
the
events
that
led
up
to
that.
this
particular
occurrence
was
on
december
the
12.
we
filed
our
complaint
by
the
21.
the
single-judge
granted
a
temporary
restraining
order
holding
things
in
status
quo.
we
also
filed
a
motion
for
preliminary
injunction
and
requesting
the
convening
of
the
three-judge
court.
in
january
2,
the
tro
was
extended
as
i
recall
by
agreement.
on
the
19,
the
defendant's
filed
an
answer
to
the
motion
for
injunction
joining
issue
on
our
allegations.
and
on
january
the
23,
the
tro
was
extended
to
february
the
23
which
was
also
the
date
of
the
hearing
set
for
the
three-judge
court.
so
by
january
of
23,
everybody
had
their
pleadings
in
order
and
the
three-judge
court
had
been
convened
and
the
application
for
the
preliminary
injunction
was
then
pending.
it
was
february
15,
some
two
or
three
weeks
later
that
for
the
first
time,
the
motion
to
dismiss
surfaced
and
was
called
to
the
attention
of
the
court
in
connection
with
a
contemporaneously
filed
motion
for
a
continuance
seeking
to
have
the
court
put
off
the
hearing
that
had
already
been
scheduled
on
the
pleadings
and
concentrate
only
on
the
motion
to
dismiss.
the
court
on
february
20,
three
days
before
the
previously
scheduled
hearing
entered
an
order
deferring
the
motion
to
dismiss
or
carrying
it
along
with
the
case
as
we
say
down
there
and
denying
the
motion
for
continuance.
and
then
on
the
23,
the
hearing
was
held
on
which
date
incidentally
and
for
the
first
time
the
defendant's
filed
any
character
of
proof,
this
being
in
the
form
of
affidavits
from
some
of
them
and
some
of
the
deputies.
i
think
and
submit
that
the
court
was
entitled
with
respect
to
the
motion
dismissed
to
be
very
suspicious
of
the
validity
of
the
good
faith,
coming
not
only
as
a
matter
of
time
when
it
did,
and
in
fact
as
i
recall,
the
presiding
judge,
judge
thornberry
raised
that
very
question
during
the
hearing
as
to
the
timing
of
that
motion.
if
you
thought
he
said,
if
you
thought
that
these
events
had
occurred
on
a
federal
enclave
over
which
the
state
had
no
jurisdiction,
why
have
you
waited
this
long
to
call
it
to
our
attention?
but
in
any
event,
the
motion
to
dismiss
if
the
court
please
is
directed
only
to
that
event.
the
motion
to
dismiss
is
limited
to
the
fact
that
the
--
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
it's
page
16
of
the
brown
appendix,
page
16.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
the
last
two
sentences,
the
defendants
would
show
the
court
that
no
useful
purpose
could
now
be
served
by
granting
an
injunction
to
prevent
the
prosecution
of
these
suits
because
the
same
no
longer
exists.
plaintiffs
can
asked
no
greater
relief
in
the
instant
case
than
that
the
complaints
heretofore
filed
be
dismissed
for
want
of
jurisdiction.
well
of
course,
we
can,
not
only
can
but
did
ask
for
more
relief
than
just
to
stop
to
pending
prosecutions
where
we
had
a
prayer
for
declaratory
judgment
that
the
statute
be
declared
unconstitutional.
we
had
a
prayer
for
preliminary
injunction
later
permanent
injunction.
we
have
a
prayer
for
general
relief
that
i
submit
is
so
broad
that
if
relief
could
be
granted,
we
could
still
ask
for
monetary
damages
for
the
action
vested
upon
the
appellees
here.
and
the
court
had
this
kind
of
evidence
before
it
too
which
i
think
this
court
can
easily
conclude
that
the
district
court
not
only
considered
but
was
impressed
by
it
to
justify
this
kind
of
evidence,
to
justify
the
sworn
testimony
in
the
sense
of
affidavits,
we
agreed
and
the
stipulation
that
those
affidavits
meant
that
those
people
given
the
affidavits
if
called
to
testify
would
testify
in
the
fashion
shown
on
the
affidavits,
this
was
all
done
by
agreement
for
the
convenience
of
the
court.
the
appellees
here,
the
three
young
men
who
were
handled
in
bell
county
as
they
were
and
other
affiance
called
as
witnesses
through
their
affidavits,
who
were
there
also
as
a
part
of
the
demonstration,
all
said
that
they
were
limiting
their
activities
in
the
committee
it's
peaceful
protest
that
they
would
not
return
to
bell
county,
that
they
would
not
engage
in
any
demonstrations
in
bell
county
and
some
said
elsewhere,
so
long
as
the
statute
was
being
used
in
the
fashion
that
it
was.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
well,
i
think
it's
an
expression
of
fear
maybe
not
or
maybe
it
was
stated
directly
to
the
statute
itself,
but
it
was
stated
in
terms
of
if
this
is
the
way
the
statute
--
if
people
can
be
charged
for
disturbing
the
peace
for
what
we've
done,
well
then,
we
are
not
going
to
do
it
until
something
is
done
about
the
statute.
the
point
that
i'm
trying
to
get
to
is
to
suggest
to
the
court
that
when
the
district
court
accepted
those
statements
not
only
by
the
appellees
but
by
their
witnesses
who
were
there
in
the
demonstration,
they
have
very
good
reason
for
accepting
him
and
believing
him
and
get
writing
relief
based
on
that
or
indicating
that
we
were
entitled
to
relief
based
on
that.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
we
did
not
allege
that
the
defendants,
the
appellants
here
had
previously
used
this
statute,
excuse
me.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
it's
actually
254.r.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
yes.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
yes,
it's
still
--
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
well,
i
thought
--
i
think
it
is
especially
in
this
case
where
our
attorney
general
--
where
the
attorney
general
appear
--
our
state
attorney
general
appears
in
the
case
--
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
--
a
part
of
the
state
of
texas.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
well,
but
he
is
in
effect
saying
as
he
did
in
the
pleadings
that
the
statute
was
valid,
that
the
events
that
occurred
there
were
the
disturbance
of
the
peace
and
he's
alleging
really
that
local
event
in
bell
county
was
proper
and
is
effect
for
the
state
of
texas
adapting
that
position.
i
think
the
court
was
entitled
to
consider
that.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
yes.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
we
contend
it
and
we
allege
that
what
was
happening
in
bell
county
which
is
a
focal
point
for
such
demonstrations
for
the
reason
that
counsel
pointed
out
was
deterring
the
exercise
of
free
speech
of
people
that
wanted
to
go
to
bell
county
to
demonstrate.
we
did
not
contend
that
the
same
thing
was
happening
in
other
parts
of
the
state
because
we
weren't
really
trying
that
that
all
of
these
are
true.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
actually
wanted
to
do?
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
we
alleged
what
the
university
committee
did
in
terms
of
not
only
activities
--
in
terms
of
its
activities,
demonstrations,
distribution
of
literature
-
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
and
said
that
it
had
been
--
if
various
individuals
handle
it
different
way,
some
individual
says
we
have
seized
all
activities,
other
said
we
have
seized
any
activity
in
bell
county,
we
will
not
go
back
to
killeen
in
bell
county
and
the
fort
hood
area.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
i
believe
it's
in
both.
we
allege
in
our
complaint
--
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
that
the
sole
purpose
of
these
activities
about
the
defendants
were
to
deter,
intimidate,
hinder,
prevent
plaintiffs
and
the
members
from
--
members
of
the
university
committee,
his
friends
and
supporters
from
exercising
the
rights
guaranteed.
we
say
unless
the
court
restrains
the
operation
and
enforcement
of
the
void
and
valid
unconstitutional
statute,
plaintiffs
and
members
of
the
committee
will
suffer
immediate
the
--
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
well,
we
say
as
long
as
the
charges
are
pending,
we
would
it
be
fearful
of
exercising
the
rights,
our
federal
rights
guaranteed
and
then
the
affidavits
come
along
and
say
that
they
have
indeed
ceased
activities
either
state
wide
in
the
event
of
some
of
the
parts
or
just
in
bell
county
in
the
case
of
others.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
the
details
are
in
the
affidavits
and
what
i
want
to
try
to
point
out
at
this
time
is
to
show
why
the
court
below
was
justified
in
accepting
those
statements
against
the
background
of
the
other
evidence
that
was
before
the
court,
what
counsel
labeled
yesterday
as
unfortunate
events.
some
of
those
unfortunate
events
included
the
following
based
on
the
evidence
that
was
before
the
court,
sheriff
gunn
himself
said
to
two
of
the
demonstrators
who
were
not
actually
handled,
who
were
not
arrested,
who
were
not
jailed
sue
granville
and
phillip
juvenville
get
out
of
my
county
and
don't
come
back,
don't
ever
want
to
see
your
faces
in
bell
county
again.
now
gunn
contrary
to
counsels'
suggested
yesterday
does
not
deny
having
made
those
statements.
he
denies
having
said
other
things
to
the
specific
appellees
here
in
and
out
of
the
jail
but
he
does
not
deny
in
his
affidavit
making
those
statements
to
sue
granville
and
phillip
juvenville.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
no,
we
do
not
allege
any
experience
in
any
other
counties.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
this
case
relates
solely
to
what
happened,
arises
solely
from
what
happened
in
the
bell
county.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
well,
it
occurs
to
me
that
if
the
statute
is
of
course
it
was
invalid
in
bell
county,
its
invalid
state
wide.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
and
it's
just
--
excuse
me,
it
just
happens
that
this
situation
arose
from
bell
county.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
well,
no
sir.
that's
exactly
another
threat
of
--
the
point
that's
made
throughout
these
affidavits.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
well,
may
i
comment
about
that?
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
i
don't
see
how
we
could.
we'd
have
to
allege
as
i
understanding
it
under
dombrowski
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional,
and
that
--
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
well,
we
say
it
was
used
on
this
occasion
and
that
they
were
threatening
us
in
effect
with
using
it
again
and
again
and
again
if
we
came
back.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
i
infer
that
from
all
of
these
events
that
happened.
the
sheriff's
saying
“don't
come
back,
we
don't
want
to
see
your
face
here
again.
“
the
other
things
that
--
i
have
to
call
to
the
court's
attention,
these
other
evidentiary
events
that
happened
at
fort
end
what
would
happen
in
the
future.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
after
the
--
i'm
sorry,
i
don't
get
your
timing
there,
after
the
court
handed
down
its
shall
we
say
opinion?
we
did
not
apply
because
the
court
said
we're
deferring
any
further
action
until
the
legislature
acts.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
the
legislature
met.
the
legislature
--
while
the
legislature
was
in
session,
mr.
justice
black
entered
a
stay
order
which
is
still
in
effect.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
we
will
--
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
we
will
appear
before
the
court
and
make
application
for
whatever
relief
then
appears
to
be
appropriate.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
we
think
frankly
that
the
declaration
of
the
statute
is
unconstitutional,
is
sufficient
to
preclude
any
other
bona
fide
prosecutions
under
the
statute.
we
believe
the
state
and
local
district
county
attorney
will
follow
the
law
if
it's
declared
unconstitutional,
they
won't
--
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
we
may
not
in
view
of
the
problems
that
--
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
well,
i
don't
suggest
we
were
not
interested.
i
say
we
may
not.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
we
may
not,
but
i
must
again
emphasize
this
point
that
i'm
trying
to
make
that
the
court
below
acted
very
properly
in
seeing
that
there
was
a
case
and
there
was
a
controversy
that
it
was
continuing,
that
it
was
very
live
because
of
what
the
appellees
said
as
to
restricting
their
activities,
and
if
they
were
justified
and
accepting
that
by
reason
of
what
had
happened
to
them
in
bell
county
and
what
was
threatened
would
reoccur
in
the
event,
they
went
back
to
bell
county.
i
have
indicated
what
the
sheriff
himself
said
when
they
were
taken
before
the
justice
of
the
peace.
he
greeted
them
under
the
evidence
of
this
case,
he
greeted
them
with
the
statement,
“we
don't
like
traitors
around
here.
”
and
he
said
--
he
says,
“you
can
plead
guilty,
you'd
fined
$200.00
or
you
can
plead
not
guilty
and
i'll
put
you
in
jail
until
you
can
make
$500.00
bond.
”
and
one
of
the
appellees
here
said
isn't
that
a
little
high?
and
he
said
“well
sure,
it's
high,
but
i
want
you
to
make
sure
you're
back
here
because
i
want
to
see
that
this
case
is
tried.
”
while
after
that
happened,
an
officer
of
the
law
is
there
in
jp's
office
and
he
confronts
one
of
the
appellees
and
he
is
toying
with
live
bullets
in
his
hands.
and
he
says,
“you
know
sonny,
i
shot
a
lot
of
mad
dogs
in
my
day
and
i
could
shoot
a
traitor,
i
could
shoot
a
traitor
and
never
give
it
a
thought.
it'd
be
just
like
shooting
a
mad
dog.
”
and
then
when
they
finally
get
moved
from
the
killeen
city
jail
and
to
be
taken
over
to
belton
community
or
town
some
15
or
20
miles
away
to
be
put
in
that
jail,
the
killeen
police
chief
tells
them,
“don't
come
back
here.
we
don't
like
your
kind
around
here
and
tell
your
university
of
texas
friends
the
same
thing
because
we
got
all
the
education
we
need
right
here
at
the
junior
college.
”
all
of
these
activities,
all
of
this
evidence,
the
whole
point
of
bringing
it
up
is
to
justify
what
the
court
below
found
was
a
live
controversy,
a
genuine
good
faith,
solid
based
statement
by
each
of
the
appellees
and
their
associates
that
they
were
no
longer
going
to
engage
in
demonstrations
because
this
is
what
happened
to
them
and
would
happen
to
them.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
well,
--
not
state
wide,
obviously
not
state
wide
but
this
--
sir?
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
well,
--
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
one
event
on
one
day
with
a
threat
of
what
would
happen
if
they
came
back
to
have
any
other
event
on
any
other
day.
i
don't
--
it's
occurs
to
me
that
we
should
not
be
required
to
keep
testing
the
statements
that
these
officers
had
made
in
order
to
have
standing
to
complaint
and
say
we're
being
put
up
on
and
we're
being
mistreated
and
we
can't
get
a
fair
trial
up
there
and
come
into
federal
courts
for
relief.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
i'll
accept
the
professor's
statement
on
that,
but
view
that
carefully
--
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
i'm
suggesting
to
the
court
that
we
have
definitely
shown
in
this
case
a
chilling
effect
by
reason
of
acts
of
conduct
that
happened
there
and
that
are
threatened
to
reoccur
every
time
any
of
these
people
or
their
associates
or
their
friends
and
supporters
ever
again
enter
bell
county
in
order
to
engage
in
a
peaceful
demonstration.
in
order
to
do
as
what
the
counsel
himself
said
to
the
court
yesterday
was
nothing
improper
about
their
protest
and
may
i
hark
right
back
to
the
business
about
the
president
of
the
united
states
and
that
to
show
that
not
only
does
this
evidence
show
that
any
other
time
they
went
up
there
for
any
other
purpose,
the
same
as
likely
to
reoccur,
but
also
to
suggest
that
to
protect
the
president
on
this
occasion,
all
that
was
necessary
was
to
once
whoever
the
officers
were
that
seized
them
and
detained
them
and
walked
them
out
to
the
edge
of
crowd
was
then
to
suggest
that
they
leave.
there
was
no
necessity
in
protecting
the
president.
for
these
deputy
sheriffs
then,
to
seize
them
and
handcuff
them
and
frisk
them
and
put
them
in
the
cars
and
take
them
down
to
the
killeen
jail
choking
them
along
the
way
while
they
were
down
there
and
engaging
in
this
further
activity
that
really
gave
rise
to
the
complaints.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
weren't
they
just
what
sir?
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
oh,
no.
no.
they
--
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
no.
the
sheriff
while
still
--
the
sheriff
--
while
an
evidence
shows,
the
sheriff
while
still
at
the
scene
told
his
deputy,
who
deputy
strange,
i
believe
his
name
is
and
deputy
strange
confirms
this
that
while
he
was
taking
the
appellees
into
the
killeen
jail,
he
was
in
communication
with
the
sheriff
and
told
him
to
file
disturbing
of
peace
complaints.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
well,
with
just
a
matter
of
minutes.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
no,
wait.
we
don't
think
at
this
--
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
if
the
statute
--
you're
suggesting
if
the
statute
were
constitutional?
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
well,
no.
we'd
have
to
complain
about
the
abuse
of
the
statute,
but
here
we're
complaining
about
both.
there's
unconstitutional
and
we
also
alleged
the
other
branch
of
dombrowski
too
below.
mr.
sam
houston
clinton,
jr.
that's
correct,
yes,
sir.
thank
you.
