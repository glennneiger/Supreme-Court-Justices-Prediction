justice

white
that's
the
final
judgment?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
there's
a
final
judgment
or
purpose
to
sustain
any
jurisdiction?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
statute
is
the
only
breach
of
peace
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
could
they
charge
that
kind
of
statutes?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
the
judgment
for
the
declaratory
judgment
and
the
injunction
stand
on
the
same
footing,
i
take
it.
i
mean,
if
there's
a
judgment
for
one,
is
the
judgment
for
the
other,
isn't
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
even
to
be
--
even
to
be
here,
there
has
to
be
a
judgment.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
there
is
a
judgment?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it's
reviewable
here.
but
to
the
extent
it's
there,
it's
for
both
declaratory
judgment
and
injunction?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
isn't
the
--
isn't
under
zwickler
the
--
at
least
the
not
of
the
criminal
charges
are
dismissed,
doesn't
the
--
isn't
the
injunctive
judgment
at
least
an
error?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
there
was
a
judgment
for
one,
there's
a
judgment
for
the
other.
there's
a
judgment
that
there
isn't
and
that
he's
entitled
to
an
injunction.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
isn't
that
judgment
wrong
under
zwickler?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
that
this
is
the
matter
of
comity,
you
could
expect
the
state
courts
to
recognize
that
if
this
statute
is
bad
as
a
declaratory
judgment
says
it
was,
that
the
state
court
would
enforce
--
would
recognize
it
was
bad,
and
would
recognize
some
constitutional
defense
to
a
prosecution.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
there
are
no
findings
other
than
those
that
you
can
glean
from
the
opinion?
justice
byron
r.
white
both
of
those
were
public
places,
i
take
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
any
of
the
cases
in
which
there's
--
in
which
the
court
said
that
first
amendment
protects
loud
or
vociferous
conduct
or
noises
in
your
private
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
where
did
they
take
place?
justice
byron
r.
white
where
are
the
college
campuses?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
there's
any
distinguished,
anything
that
distinguished
between
college
campus
and
a
street?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
campus
was
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
public
knowledge?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
think
just
because
a
crowd
of
people
are
invited
on
a
certain
piece
of
property
that
another
crowd
of
people
can
come
on
and
make
all
the
noise
that
they
want?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
you
say
that,
if
you
mean
just
in
these
circumstances?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
suppose
there's
more
of
a
real
controversy
here
though
than
there
was
in
epperson
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
the
--
are
you
saying
there
was
no
case
of
controversy
or
that
there
was
not,
but
there
was
--
but
the
court
should
not
have
entered
either
at
the
third
for
a
judgment
or
an
injunction?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
would
you
say
if
criminal
charges
were
dismissed
and
no
criminal
charges
were
pending
but
there
were
allegations
that
because
of
the
statute
and
because
of
past
conduct,
we
are
now
deterred
from
taking
some
following
of
course
that
we
would
have
otherwise.
would
that
amounts
to
a
case
in
controversy
in
your
view?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
i
understand
that.
there
were
no
allegations
of
harassment
or
non-good
faith
application
of
the
law,
but
the
allegation
is
or
suppose
the
allegation
was
that
we
know
that
the
statute
might
be
applied
in
these
circumstances
and
we
are
now
not
holding
anymore
demonstrations
or
expressing
our
views
at
all
because
of
the
statute,
and
that
gives
us
a
case
or
controversy.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
was
there
an
actual
allegation
here
of
deterrence?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
did
you
allege
anything
in
your
complaint
that
indicated
that
there
was
something
you
wanted
to
do
that
you
hadn't
done?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
you
haven't
been?
i
mean
specifically
other
than
just
generalities?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
you
alleged
you've
seized
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
was
in
your
complaint
or
in
the
affidavits
or
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
just
said
you
say
will?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
i
know,
i
know,
but
that's
a
long
way
from
saying
that
you
had
actually
had
then
deterred
from
a
course
the
conduct?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
the
details
were
in
the
affidavits?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
the
final
judgment?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
there's
a
final
judgment
or
purpose
to
sustain
any
jurisdiction?
justice
byron

white
that
statute
is
the
