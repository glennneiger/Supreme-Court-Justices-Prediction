chief
justice
earl
warren
professor,
i'm
just
wondering
in
view
of
your
statement
that
this
was
not
a
lawful
procedure,
this
arrest
that
was
made,
and
that
therefore,
haven't
been
dismissed
and
none
of
that
was
forced,
what
is
there
to
prevent
the
same
people
from
doing
what
they
said
they
would
do,
just
to
piss
saying,
you
stay
out
of
our
county,
we
don't
want
people
like
you,
and
the
chief
of
police
calling
them
traitors
and
telling
what
he
would
do.
what
is
there
to
prevent
those
people
from
doing
the
same
thing
they
did
here,
and
then
when
the
--
on
the
ordinances
attack
for
the
better
in
which
is
being
used
to
dismiss
it
again
and
put
them
to
that
trouble
again,
and
give
them
a
$500.00
bail
from
the
maximum
punishment
was
$200.00?
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
four
is
still
twice
as
much
(voice
overlap).
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
think
that
was
chief
of
police
if
i
remember
correctly,
and
i
think
the
justice
of
peace
was
accused
of
saying
that
he
put
the
bail
at
$400.00
because
he
wanted
to
see
that
they
came
back
and
he
could
try
them
for
the
offense
and
that
they
didn't
want
people
of
that
kind
in
the
county.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
it
necessary
to
declare
this
ordinance
unconstitutional
on
its
face
in
order
to
get
a
declaratory
judgment,
an
injunction
against
this
kind
of
conduct
on
the
part
of
the
chief
of
police
and
the
justice
of
peace?

it
is

i
mean
on
the
record
in
this
court,
the

general?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
we
have
the
--
professor,
do
we
to
justify
that
kind
of
conduct
in
order
to
consider
this
justiciable
today
and
to
grant
some
relief
to
this
man?
