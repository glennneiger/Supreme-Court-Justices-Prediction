justice
thurgood
marshall
is
this
declaratory
judgment
stop
him
from
saying
i
don't
want
you
in
my
county.
if
you
come
near
again,
i
will
give
you
$500.00
fine?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
there's
a
judgment
here.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
one
word
in
the
record
by
affidavit
or
anything
else
from
the
chief
of
police,
the
sheriff
or
anybody
that
said
they
won't
do
this
again?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
is
there
anything
using
those
words?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
it
did
say
that
the
state
could
pass
it
as
legal?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
clinton,
my
problem
is
assuming
that
the
officials
in
this
county
did
exactly
everything
that
you
alleged
they
did,
why
is
that
sufficient
ground
to
not
have
the
the
state
wide
statute?
do
you
allege
that
any
other
counties
are
going
to
enforce
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
alleged
that
any
other
person
police
official
is
going
to
use
it
the
way
it
was
used
here?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
could
you
get
the
same
relief
by
enjoining
those
officials
from
acting
without
knocking
the
statute
out?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
respect
to
submit
the
situation
would
not
arise
again
in
bell
county
unless
the
president
of
the
united
states
came
down
now?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
can't
leave
that
out?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
at
first
i
want
to
know,
can
you
get
your
relief
without
knocking
the
statute
out?
if
so,
you're
going
to
understand
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
did
dombrowski
said
the
statute
was
being
used
systematically
over
and
over
and
over
again.
you
say
the
statute
was
used
once
by
one
group
of
officers?
justice
thurgood
marshall
where
do
you
get
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
if
this
case
--
did
you
ever
apply
for
an
injunction
after
the
judgment
in
this
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
then
the
legislature
closed?
justice
thurgood
marshall
still
in
effect?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
if
this
case
is
decided
and
sent
back,
then
you
apply
for
an
injunction,
will
you
get
it
or
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
will
you
get
that
back?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
other
relief
is
appropriate
other
than
an
injunction?
justice
thurgood
marshall
say
you
wouldn't
ask
for
an
injunction?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
if
you're
not
interested
in
an
injunction,
where
do
we
get
our
jurisdiction?
justice
thurgood
marshall
[attempt
to
laughter]
what?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you,
since
you
push
that
point
so
far,
do
you
think
the
sheriff
or
any
of
his
people
had
the
slightest
idea
that
they
will
be
going
to
use
this
statute
where
they
just
working
them
over?
justice
thurgood
marshall
working
them
over,
period.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
then
later,
they
found
the
statute?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
was
afterwards,
wasn't
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
mean
but
it
was
after.
all
i'm
trying
to
say
is
your
complaint
is
against
some
police
officials
of
that
county,
not
against
the
statute.
suppose
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
suppose
there
had
been
a
texas
statute,
a
disorderly
conducts
statute
that
was
satisfactory
to
you
and
the
nine
of
us,
and
they
did
the
same
thing
and
you,
there's
no
doubt,
they
would,
you
wouldn't
be
able
to
get
to
the
statute,
would
you?
the
statute
was
just
an
excuse,
wasn't
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
know,
but
the
court
took
one
problem,
the
statutes
were
unconstitutional?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
is
this
anything
more
than
a
judgment
of
the
court
that
we
will
hold
this
case
and
retain
jurisdiction?
is
there
anything
else
in
that
last
paragraph?
justice
thurgood
marshall
may
i
ask
you
one
thing
professor?
how
can
anybody
given
contempt
to
that
piece
of
paper?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but,
it
has
something
closely
resembling
an
order?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
you
don't
have
an
order
here,
do
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
this
declaratory
judgment
stop
him
from
saying
i
don't
want
you
in
my
county.
if
you
come

again,
i
will
give
you
