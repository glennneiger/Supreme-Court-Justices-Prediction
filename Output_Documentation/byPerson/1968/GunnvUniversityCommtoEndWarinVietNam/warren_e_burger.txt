chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
resume
the
arguments
in
number
7,
gunn
against
the
university
committee.
mr.
louisell
you
may
pick
up
where
you
left
off.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
didn't
carve
out
any
exception?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
louisell.
mr.
clinton?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
are
you
addressing
to
that
observation
to
the
limitation
of
the
injunction
so
that
if
they
have
some
rational
relationship
to
the
events?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
where
does
that
appear
mr.
clinton?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
could
that
conceivably
be
form
of
protest
against
the
statute
as
well
as
bona
fide
expression
of
a
fear,
--
the
statute
it's
got
to
be
a
fear,
an
apprehension,
doesn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
professor
louisell,
i
think
argued
yesterday
mr.
clinton
that
the
1871
statute
was
not
aimed
at
isolated
or
sporadic
enforcement
of
a
particular
statute
in
a
particular
way,
but
systematic
or
pattern
of
the
use
of
local
statutes
to
inhibit
constitutional
rights.
do
you
think
that
going
back
to
your
original
pleading,
do
you
think
you
have
a
case
of
systematic
conduct
or
pattern
of
conduct
to
deprive
people
of
their
constitutional
rights
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let's
suppose,
let
me
try
hypothetical
case
that
might
illustrated
that.
i
think
someone
said
texas
had
365
or
367
counties?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
254?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
that's
still
quite
a
few
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
you
got
a
prosecutor
in
each
county
and
you
have
one
prosecutor
in
one
of
those
counties
who
has
some
aberrations
about
a
texas
statute
and
enforces
it
in
a
certain
way.
is
that
the
kind
of
state
action
which
1871
act
contemplated
where
it's
one
prosecutor
in
one
of
265
counties
or
is
that
must
have
be
something
broader
than
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
that's
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that's
after
the
event?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that's
an
argument
over
the
factual
issue
of
whether
this
was
a
disorderly
conduct
case
or
whether
it
was
a
repression
of
first
amendment
rights,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he's
defending
on
the
different
ground
quite
different
from
your
attack?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let's
assume
they
could
have
demonstrated
with
solid
evidence
that
all
of
those
allegations
were
true,
those
are
just
allegations
now
of
course,
do
you
think
those
allegations
if
true
would
bring
it
within
the
systematic
pattern
of
conduct
that
dombrowski
case
was
talking
about?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
in
dombrowski,
it
was
sustained
over
a
period
of
time.
dombrowski
opinion
describes
the
series
of
events
which
had
this
inhibiting
effects
drying
up
contributions,
acts
that
took
place
over
a
period
of
many
months
if
not
years.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
here
you
have
one
event
on
one
day,
don't
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
that
goes
back
again
to
what
was
suggested
about
the
1871
act.
it
was
aimed
only
at
sustaining
systematic,
organized
patterns
of
harassment
of
a
particular
group
of
people
or
a
particular
kind
of
conduct.
is
that
not
true
the
1871
statute?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
the
dombrowski
case
opinion
reflects
that
too?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
clinton
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
louisell,
you
have
two
minutes
left.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
just
to
pursue
the
point
that
i
think
justice
stewart
raised
earlier,
isn't
the
very
function
of
the
judgment
which
ordinarily
follows
the
opinion
on
the
expression
of
the
court
as
to
what
it's
going
to
do,
isn't
the
very
function
of
that
judgment
defined
precisely
and
narrowly
and
specifically
the
general
thrust
which
the
court's
memorandum
opinion
has
articulated?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
wouldn't
that
be
very
likely
that
an
injunction
of
this
stringent
nature
would
have
been
very
precise
and
very
specific
as
against
the
broad
and
sweeping
language
of
the
court's
opinion?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
professor
louisell.
thank
you
mr.
clinton.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.

we
will
resume
the
