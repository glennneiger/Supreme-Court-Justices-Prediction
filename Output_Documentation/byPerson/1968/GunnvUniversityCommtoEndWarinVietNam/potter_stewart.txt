justice
potter
stewart
on
the
basis
of
those
of
facts,
i
have
a
little
difficulty
seeing
how
they
fit
within
the
language
of
the
texas
statute
appearing
on
the
bottom
of
page
3
and
the
top
of
page
--
above
page
2
and
the
top
of
page
3
of
your
brief.
justice
potter
stewart
because
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
statute
seems
to
require
at
least
some
kind
of
noise,
doesn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
it
either
noise
or
something
it
can
--
indecent
exposure.
justice
potter
stewart
or
they
displaying
of
a
weapon.
justice
potter
stewart
i
suppose
that
could
be
argued
that
the
use
of
not
of
loud
and
vociferous
certainly,
but
the
use
of
obscene
vulgar
or
indecent
language
could
be
by
writing
rather
than
orally.
justice
potter
stewart
they
declare
the
whole
statute
unconstitutional
--
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
think?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
because
that's
one
the
difficulties
in
this
case,
there
being
no
injunction
you
can't
tell
this
part
one.
justice
potter
stewart
no.
justice
potter
stewart
you
do
understand
that
the
district
court
in
fact
did
declare
null
and
void
under
the
constitution,
those
parts
of
the
statute
that
have
to
do
with
indecent
exposure
and
firearms
and
so
on?
justice
potter
stewart
because
that's
the
difficulty
in
the
case
when
there's
actually
no
injunction.
you
can't
tell
and
that's
the
reason
for
the
rule
under
law
that
it
requires
an
injunction
to
be
very
carefully
and
precisely
drafted.
justice
potter
stewart
and
here's
no
injunction
at
all?
justice
potter
stewart
if
the
statement,
if
there
any
--
justice
potter
stewart
we
don't
have
any
power
at
all
to
review
a
case
in
which
an
injunction
hasn't
either
been
granted
or
denied.
and
here
your
suggestion
is
we
now
remand
it
so
an
injunction
can
be
granted.
we
don't
have
any
jurisdiction
to
this
case
unless
an
injunction
has
been
granted
or
denied
under
section
1253.
justice
potter
stewart
but
then
as
a
practical
matter,
this
court
has
no
jurisdiction
to
review
anything
under
section
1253.
you
know
what
its
words
say,
don't
you?
justice
potter
stewart
and
it
was
very
understandable
the
courtesy
and
deference
that
the
three-judge
court
showed
to
the
sovereign
state
of
texas
i
suggest
that
the
result
of
what
it
did
is
quite
unfortunate
because
it
leaves
an
essentially
advisory
committee
--
essentially
advisory
opinion
unreviewable.
justice

there

there

justice

no,
no.
i
had
in
mind
section
1253
and
i
point
out
to
your
own
words
and
your
motion
for
a
new
trial
to
the
district
court.
i'm
quoting
from
you
motion,
you
said
that
“the
court
had
given
not
a
declaratory
judgment,
but
an
advisory
opinion.
”
and
so
according
to
your
submission
to
that
court
with
which
i
agree,
the
court
has
not
even
given
a
declaratory
judgment
much
less
entered

refused
to
enter
an
injunction.
justice

an
outrageous
situation.
justice

where
can
you
find
any

justice

yes,
but
where
can
you
find
the
judgment,
any

justice

it's

here,

it?

there

we
can

there
