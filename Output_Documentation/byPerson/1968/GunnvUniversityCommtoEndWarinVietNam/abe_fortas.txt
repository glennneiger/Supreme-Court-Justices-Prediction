justice
abe
fortas
counsel,
may
i
ask
you
this
question.
you
have
two
problems
here
as
i
understand
this
case.
one
is
the
dombrowski
issue
of
jurisdiction,
the
other
is
a
question
as
to
whether
this
statutes
unconstitutional
on
its
face.
now,
what
actually
happened
here
is
that
there
was
a
criminal
prosecution
of
these
people
who
are
here
as
appellants,
and
that
was
dismissed.
no
basis
for
them
and
the
statute
according
to
the
texas
courts,
that's
not
this
case.
subsequently
--
justice
abe
fortas
alright,
subsequently,
this
suit
was
instituted
by
the
people
who
appear
here
as
appellees.
justice
abe
fortas
and
the
--
before
three-judge
court,
that
three-judge
court
granted
a
declaratory
judgment
and
entered
the
order
that
you
said,
men
said
we
state
the
mandate
and
we
won't
actually
enter
an
order
of
injunction
right
now
but
a
declaratory
judgment
was
granted,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
alright,
they
grant
--
they
did
say
that
plaintiffs
are
entitled
to
a
declaratory
judgment
and
that
they
won't
do
anything
further
by
way
of
injunction
until
after
the
texas
legislature
met,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that.
now,
what
your
argument
here
is
that
there
was
no
jurisdiction
under
dombrowski
to
entertain
this
action,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
and
do
you
also
argue
that
if
jurisdiction
lies
and
nevertheless
a
statute
is
not
unconstitutional
on
its
face?
justice
abe
fortas
counsel,
did
you
say
tell
us
whether
this
committee
still
exists
and
is
it
active?
justice
abe
fortas
what
is
the
meaning
of
that
statement
that
it
is
still
exists?
