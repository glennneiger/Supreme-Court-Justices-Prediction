justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
who
do
you
represent
counsel?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
confess
i'm
confused.
you
just
conceded
with
statute
and
the
lack
of
ability.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
thought
the
three-judge
court
would
struck
down
the
statute
for
overbreadth,
did
they?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
your
position
that
is,
is
what?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
with
the
injunction
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there
is
probably
a
declaratory
judgment
that
the
statute
is
impermissibly
and
constantly
broad
and
to
injunctive
relief
against
the
enforcement
of
article
474
is
not
worthy
insofar
as
any
specialized
guarantee
under
circumstances,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
all
you
gamble
the
way
with
orders?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
is
that
what
you
recourse
for
review?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
say
that
what
we
should
do
is
reverse
that
order
that
you
brought
it,
and
what,
remand
the
direction
to
dismiss
the
complaint?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
we
never
reverse
the
case
of
a
moot
case
and
vacate
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
is
a
non-existence
of
a
non-existing
controversy?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
on
page
18,
i
gather,
those
are
the
copies
of
the
plaintiff
files
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
i
am
just
confused.
are
you
saying
that
that
complaint
is
not
taking
charge
of
the
section
474?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
lawfully
and
willfully,
i
guess
that
may
disturb
the
peace,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
this
is
not
a
charge
of
474,
was
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know.
what
i
was
trying
to
get
at,
are
you
telling
us
there's
no
reason
rule
6
--
474
before
us
and
never
has
been
a
rule
of
case,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
not
my
question.
are
you
telling
us
that
this
complaint
makes
no
charge
in
the
474
and
therefore,
no
question
about
it
based
otherwise
that
474
is
even
in
this
litigation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
since
that
(voice
overlap)
this
complaint
was
dismissed
wherein
the
course
of
this
civil
proceeding
in
california,
are
you
also
making
the
argument
that
in
mere
fact
that
the
dismissal
now
remove
any
basis
upon
which
three-judge
court
that
either
render
a
declaratory
judgment
or
a
comfortable
relief
there's
nothing
will
enjoin,
no
prosecution
to
enjoin
and
nothing
about
what's
to
give
a
declaratory
judgment
since
there
was
no
threat
of
invoking
the
statute
against
these
people,
did
you
notice
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
do
you
do
with
zwickler
and
krueger?
zwickler
and
krueger
where
we
set
wholly,
when
we
set
back
to
the
three-judge
court,
you
said
no,
this
may
not
be
a
situation
for
declaratory
judgment
at
all.
and
there
are
elements
required
to
maintain
the
declaratory
judgment.
we
told
them
they
couldn't
have
any
injunction
in
that
case
each
time
to
post
to
a
declaratory
judgment
but
only
if
that's
the
proper
suit
or
a
declaratory
judgment
for
such
(inaudible),
well
then
the
element
is
in
control,
is
that
what
this
is?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
do
you
mean
so
anxiously
to
give
us
to
say
that
they
were
wrong
on
reaching
the
constitutional
question
of
this
--
on
the
basis?
if
it
was,
then
it
was
not
a
proper
suit
for
declaratory
judgment
or
injunction
otherwise,
is
that
the
end
of
the
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
we
don't
have
to
say
they
were
wrong
or
the
statute
and
wholly
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional,
that's
the
basic
rules.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don't
understand
why
you
want
to
distinguish
it,
i'm
trying
to
help
you.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
what
you
said
and
what
we
said
included
that.
yes,
in
the
way
a
declaratory
judgment
even
though
not
to
an
injunction
under
the
circumstances
is
not
much
different,
unless
what,
it's
not
even
entirely
to
the
declaratory
judgment
unless
you're
satisfied
with
the
elements
which
make
up
that,
that's
that
true
facts
aren't
satisfactory.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
question
in
fact
where
these
complaints,
these
criminal
complaints
dismissed
before
that
proceeding
was
concluded?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
before
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they
got
it
for
the
price
that
they
had
been
dismissed?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then
what
--
how
do
you
justify
the
three-judge
court
going
on
with
your
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
there
anything
the
stipulation
whether
there
was
any
subjective
if
the
statute
was
going
to
be
enforced
against
others
in
this
situation,
a
protest
against
vietnam?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
suppose
that
all
was
flat
on
the
complaint
to
dismiss
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
there
anything
happens
then
--
where
any
of
these
folks
prosecuted
for
anything?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
any
demonstrations?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
would
like
to
see
--
are
you
suggesting
if
the
law
enforcement
with
authority
of
the
county,
that
would
demonstrate
they
now
looked
at
you,
we
don't
like
that
space
and
if
you
try
to
demonstrate
here
we're
going
to
prosecute
you
under
the
statute
that
in
and
of
itself,
that's
not
to
authorize
a
kind
of
district
court
that
would
consider
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
mentioned
by
the
law
enforcements,
and
if
they
found
it
unconstitutional
on
its
face
to
enjoin
its
(inaudible),
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
it
wasn't
the
beginning
but
what
was
their
absent
complaint
more
than
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
don't
get
to
know
the
facts
until
the
only
information.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
would
not
know
until
the
information
what
charge
you
have
to
defend
against.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
court
will
the
information
be
charged?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
was,
is
there
appeal
de
novo
or
something?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no
indication
that
the
justice
of
the
peace
had
filed
before
him
or
on
the
appeal
de
novo
that
any
defense,
constitutional
or
otherwise
would
not
be
entertained?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
the
test
in
zwickler
was
whether
there
is
substantial
controversy
of
sufficient
immediacy
in
reality
to
warrant
the
issuance
of
a
declaratory
judgment.
i
don't
see
that
the
opinion
considered
whether
on
the
question
of
declaratory
judgment.
this
record
then
did
show
a
substantial
controversy
of
sufficient
immediacy
in
reality.
what
is
it
--
what
do
you
rely
that
did
exist
such
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don't
read
the
opinion
as
having
addressed
itself
to
that
at
all.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
at
the
time
as
i
understand
it
that
at
the
time
that
the
declaratory
judgment
--
of
this
opinion
was
filed
following
the
hearing,
those
complaints
had
already
been
withdrawn.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
all
of
these
antedate
the
dismissal
of
those
charges?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
anything
at
following
the
dismissal
of
the
charges?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask,
does
the
record
show
whether
the
committee
had
demonstrated
that
any
other
place
in
that
county
except
fort
hood
at
anytime?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
as
far
as
the
record
is
concerned,
the
only
actual
demonstration
in
bell
was
this
demonstration
on
the
12th
of
december
when
president
was
at
fort
hood?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
have
they
tried
on
the
complaint?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
before
you
get
to
that,
may
i
just
ask
one
question.
are
their
findings
of
fact
that
the
sheriff
and
jp
said
the
things
that
you've
been
telling
us
about?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
those
are
just
in
the
affidavits?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
the
court
was
going
to
request,
was
all
the
question
would
not
be
appealability
of
an
order,
but
whether
there
was
any
order
at
all
which
would
be
appealable?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
what
bothered
me
about
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
even
if
they
had
in
this
mr.
louisell,
i
suppose
you
would
say
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
that
brings
it
within
golden?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
who
do
you
represent
counsel?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
confess
i'm
confused.
you
just
conceded
with
statute
and
the
lack
of
ability.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
thought
the
three-judge

justice
william
j.
brennan,

but
with

--

that

is

william

and
is
that
what

justice
william

and
you
say
that
what
we
should
do
is

that

and

we
never

vacate

justice

this

that
any
defense,
constitutional
or
otherwise
would
not
be
entertained?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
the
test
in
zwickler
was
whether
there
is
substantial
controversy
of
sufficient
immediacy
in
reality
to
warrant
the
issuance
of
a
declaratory
judgment.
i
don't
see
that
the
opinion
considered
whether
on
the
question
of
declaratory
judgment.
this
record
then
did
show
a
substantial
controversy
of
sufficient
immediacy
in
reality.
what
is
it
--
what
do
you
rely
that
did
exist
such
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don't
read
the
opinion
as
having
addressed
itself
to
that
at
all.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
at
the
time
as
i
understand
it
that
at
the
time
that
the
declaratory
judgment
--
of
this
opinion
was
filed
following
the
hearing,
those
complaints
had
already
been
withdrawn.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
all
of
these
antedate
the
dismissal
of
those
charges?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
anything
at
following
the
dismissal
of
the
charges?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask,
does
the
record
show
whether
the
committee
had
demonstrated
that
any
other
place
in
that
county
except
fort
hood
at
anytime?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
as
far
as
the
record
is
concerned,
the
only
actual
demonstration
in
bell
was
this
demonstration
on
the
12th
of
december
when
president
was
at
fort
hood?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
have
they
tried
on
the
complaint?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
before
you
get
to
that,
may
i
just
ask
one
question.
are
their
findings
of
fact
that
the
sheriff
and
jp
said
the
things
that
you've
been
telling
us
about?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
those
are
just
in
the
affidavits?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
the
court
was
going
to
request,
was
all
the
question
would
not
be
appealability
of
an
order,
but
whether
there
was
any
order
at
all
which
would
be
appealable?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
what
bothered
me
about
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
even
if
they
had
in
this
mr.
louisell,
i
suppose
you
would
say
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
that
brings
it
within
golden?
