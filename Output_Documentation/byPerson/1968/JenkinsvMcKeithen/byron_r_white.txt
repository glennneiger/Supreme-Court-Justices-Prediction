justice
byron
r.
white
but
i
take
it
in
the
long
run,
as
far
as
filing
of
charges
is
concerned
that
the
action
of
the
commission
is
only
a
recommendation
and
they
can't
themselves
effectively
file
a
--
they
can
file
a
complaint
with
the
law
enforcement
officer
i
suppose
like
any
citizen
can
but
they
can
officially
launch
a
criminal
action.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
the
law
enforcement
officer
still
has
to
make
his
decisions
whether
actually
to
file
a
charge
than
is
it
to
the
criminal
proceeding?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
commission
has
arrived
that
it's
opinion
of
the
matter
i
take
it
but
it
certainly
doesn't
bind
the
law
enforcement
official
i
take
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
doesn't
even
bind
him
to
file
a
charge.
justice
byron
r.
white
does
louisiana
use
a
grand
jury?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
there
are
some
crimes
that
require
an
indictment
by
a
grand
jury?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
suppose
then
that
the
grand
jury
might
reject
indicting
someone
even
though
the
commission
had
recommended
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
suggest
that
as
a
practical
matter,
no
prosecutor
could
afford
to
reject
one
of
these
recommendations
in
so
far
as
filing
the
complaints?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
you
--
you
don't
contend
that
your
client's
own
right
to
be
represented
by
counsel
was
violated,
do
you
agree?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
constitutional
rights
of
your
clients
were
violated
here,
his
right
to
counsel,
his
right
to
cross-examination
or
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
what
constitutional
provision
do
you
invoke
here
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
--
what
--
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
what
kind?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
in
--
what
constitutionally
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
the
constitutional
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
grand
jury
can
indict
somebody
and
never
have
him
before
or
let
him
cross-examine
witnesses
or
--
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
challenging
the
grand
jury?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
they
indict
somebody
which
they
can
charge
him
of
the
crime.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
do
you
get
away
from
the
hannah

justice
byron

white
he
doesn't
allege
that
he
was
an
object
of
the
investigation.
justice
byron

white
or
that
he
was
ever
--
i
thought
i
understood
you
to
say
that
he
has
been
charged
--
that
the
state
charges
have
been
filed
against
the
him
as
a
result
of
the
commission's
word.
justice
byron
r.

it
isn't
alleged
in
the
complaint?
justice
byron

white
there's
nothing
in
the
record
about
it?
justice
byron

was
there
any
--
any
allegations
in
the
record
or
anything
to
reveal
whether
or
not
any
witnesses
were
called
who
testified
against
him?
