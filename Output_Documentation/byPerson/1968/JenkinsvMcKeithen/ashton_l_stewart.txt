mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
yes,
sir.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
preamble
of
this
statute
provided
that
there
have
been
a
shutdown
in
the
construction
work
in
the
vicinity
of
baton
rouge
and
that
because
of
the
great
need
for
statewide
investigatory
powers
which
they
did
not
have
at
that
time
and
to
aid
and
assist
the
district
attorneys
and
the
grand
juries
and
then
law
enforcement
officers
enacted
this
legislation
in
order
to
create
this
investigatory
commission.
faced
off
it
specifically
provided
that
the
commission
should
not
make
any
adjudication
as
to
the
guilt
and
innocence
or
as
to
(inaudible)
property
rights
just
as
what's
held
in
hannah
versus
larche.
the
--
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
a
legal
adjudication.
they
can
make
findings,
yes
sir.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
no
sir.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
they
have
no
authority
to
accuse
anyone
just
as
in
the
civil
rights
commission.
that
commission
have
authority
to
make
findings
and
so
that
this
commission
have
the
authority
to
make
findings.
in
addition
to
that,
they
went
further
and
spelled
out
the
words
that
the
counsel
placed
on.
it
says,
it
may
include
in
its
findings
general
conclusions
or
particular
inclusions
as
to
particular
individuals.
i
may
not
have
the
exact
words
but
that
was
what
it
could
include
in
its
findings
but
the
--
the
words
--
yes
sir,
the
statute
does
say
so
but
of
course
all
public
reports
such
as
this
report
on
the
civil
rights
commission
would
have
been
filed
and
then
publicized
by
being
made
public.
this
report
of
this
commission
was
to
be
filed
with
the
legislature
and
the
governor
and
of
course
would
have
made
it
publicized
also.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
the
only
object
i
could
understand
from
their
statute,
if
it
please
the
court,
is
that
they
especially
wanted
everything
into
public's
eye
with
reference
to
this.
it
was
embroiled
the
community
in
such
a
tremendous
matter
that
they
wanted
everything
out
in
open
in
public.
that's
the
reason
they
required
all
the
hearings
to
be
heard
public
and
then
--
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
yes.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
that's
exactly
correct
sir.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
they
were
supposed
to
make
findings
and
that
provided
they
made
include
in
those
findings
particular
individuals
retake
--
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
yes,
that's
exactly
sir.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
yes
sir.
well,
i
don't
know
about
the
--
i
wouldn't
want
to
answer
that
right
off
but
the
civil
rights
commission
statute
does
provide
that
they
make
findings
and
i'm
reading
from
1975.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
yes,
the
civil
rights
commission
limited
to
voting
denials
and
in
that
respect
they
are
similar,
yes
sir.
its
investigation
in
that
--
in
hannah
versus
larche,
there
was
the
same
contention
made
that
they
would
publicize
and
hold
these
people
up
to
scorn
because
of
having
committed
some
crime
and
repressions
to
the
voting
thing
and
that's
the
same
identical
argument
we
made
here.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
no
sir,
i
didn't
intend
to
say
sir.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
no
sir
and
if
i
did
i'm
sorry.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
well,
it
could
be
that
judge
but
i
--
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
well,
i
would
say
as
exactly
what
the
civil
rights
commission
was.
it
had
a
right
to
have
hearings
--
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
well,
that's
exactly
right.
it
has
a
right
to
hold
hearings,
make
investigations
report
to
the
legislature
and
to
the
governor
and
it
may
include
in
its
report
particularly
individuals,
yes
sir.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
yes
sir.
under
the
statute,
they're
entitled
to
just
as
in
the
civil
rights
commission
to
be
accompanied
by
an
attorney
but
he
is
not
given
the
right
to
cross
examine
the
other
witnesses
without
the
commission's
--
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
no
sir,
it
is
not.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
yes,
sir.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
they
--
those
in
authority
or
prosecution,
yes
that
they
can
give
the
information
to
him.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
well,
this
commission
cannot
do
anything
to
deprive
him
of
any
of
his
rights
at
all.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
same
way
with
the
grand
jury,
yes,
sir.
they
can
find
him
--
they
could
charge
him
or
say
that
that
is
their
opinion
and
that
would
be
far
greater
than
this
proceeding.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
you're
certainly
correct,
yes
sir.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
this
is
a
public
hearing,
yes
sir.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
finding,
yes
sir.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
it
could
be,
yes
sir.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
yes
sir,
on
commission.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
well,
i
wouldn't
say
so,
no
more
than
any
other
commission,
no
more
than
any
other
legislative
commission
or
committee,
they
can
make
observations.
the
statute
says
to
make
findings
and
that's
whatever
the
legislative
commission
--
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
well,
i
would
think
that
would
be
sufficient
judgment.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
they
could
find
--
that
would
be
a
finding.
a
finding
would
encompass
such
--
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
well,
if
we
have
a
situation
as
we
have
here
with
these
conditions
going
on
and
with
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
attorneys
and
the
grand
juries
limited
to
parish
limits,
they
needed
something
because
this
industrial
complex
encompass
far
more
than
one
or
two
parishes.
they
needed
some
help.
what
were
they
to
do?
they
certainly
publicize
by
making
everything
public.
the
public
of
course
could
judge
very
well
if
anyone
was
doing
something
unfair
then
i
think
that
was
one
of
the
statutory
features
of
this
statute
was
public
and
not
private.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
he's
appointed
by
the
governor,
sir.
it
has
to
be
free
from
labor,
free
from
management,
and
free
from
the
public.
it
did
include
the
dean
of
the
two
university
law
schools
who
were
chairman;
the
dean
of
louisiana
state
university
was
vice
chairman.
yes
sir,
he
accepted
and
served
both
have
since
resigned
or
not
with
it
anymore.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
both
of
them,
yes
sir.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
well,
yes
sir.
both
of
them
actually
accepted
and
served.
dean
morgan
who
was
chairman
and
dean
abe
was
vice-chairman.
until
recently,
there
have
been
no
hearings
since
those
two
have
stepped
down.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
they
were
more
or
less
spelled
out
in
the
statute
that
they
had
to
do
exactly
what
they
did
in
the
civil
rights
commission.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
not
that
i
know
of
any
difference
from
those
in
the
statute.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
i'm
sure
they
have
sir,
that's
not
in
the
record.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
that's
the
general
duty
and
obligations
of
the
state
police.
anytime
they
needed
help,
these
could
be
assigned
to
the
state
police
at
that
time
the
police
--
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
under
--
yes,
under
those
circumstances.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
i'm
sure
it
has,
yes
sir.
this
commission
--
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
no
sir,
no
sir.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
well,
with
reference
to
the
procedures
here,
they're
identical
with
the
civil
rights
commission.
the
court
below
said
the
procedures
were
drafted
with
the
civil
rights
commission
as
a
model.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
no,
sir.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
no
responsibility.
in
this
one,
they
do
have
the
authority
to
file
with
--
sir?
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
to
file
with
--
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
sir?
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
not
that
i
know
of
sir.
not
the
commission,
no
sir.
no
sir,
not
that
i
know
of.
the
commission
hasn't
been
overly
successful.
the
--
i
would
like
to
answer
some
other
questions
that
have
been
raised
here,
with
reference
--
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
no
sir
i
do
not
think
so.
my
understanding
dean
morgan
was
already
retired
from
another
position
and
he
wanted
some
peace.
he
just
served
temporarily
in
my
understanding
at
the
behest
of
the
government
until
this
investigation
of
baton
rouge
business
was
over
with
and
that
with
and
after
that
he
had
stepped
down
and
the
same
way
with
dean
morgan.
and
it
was
quite
different
from
the
three
labor
members,
they
resigned
for
other
purposes
because
of
civil
service
argument
i
believe.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
nine.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
well,
i
know
that
dean
morgan
and
dean
abe
have
resigned
and
three
labor
members
they
resigned
and
i
believe
so,
subsequently
here
recently,
the
governor
haven't
accepted
their
resignation
so
they
came
back
and
they
have
now
been
holding
some
executive
meetings.
i
do
not
know.
i
do
not
represent
the
labor
management
commission.
i'm
just
handling
this
litigation
and
i'm
not
familiar
with
what
they
are
doing
in
such
as
it.
we
would
like
to
say
that
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
that
any
of
these
charges
against
mr.
jenkins
were
filed
by
this
commission
that
is
the
assault
charges.
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
his
--
the
allegation
that
was
read
was
that
these
charges
in
conspi
--
were
filed
in
conspiracy
with
the
commission.
the
affidavit
of
mr.
george
with
reference
to
the
murder
count
is
quite
different
i
think
than
saying
that
he
had
made
that
allegation.
he
says
that
he
was
advised
that
these
various
men
could
be
shot
and
killed
by
members
of
the
labor
--
by
members
of
the
commission
of
inquiry
at
the
slightest
provocation
and
the
amount
of
it
would
make
it
appear
to
be
an
act
of
self
defense
and
we
would
like
to
add
here
that
all
of
the
allegations
with
reference
to
the
administration
of
the
statute
and
we've
argued
it
at
length
in
our
brief
have
no
causal
connection
with
the
administration
of
the
statute.
they
charge
for
example
that
mr.
jenkins
himself
was
filed
on
by
the
district
attorney
that
has
no
causal
connection
with
the
commission
because
they
can't
do
that
and
it's
not
that
they
did
it.
he
does
not
allege
that.
the
causal
connection
is
lacking
to
where
they
say
that
the
commission
is
threatened
to
kill
these
six
people.
that
has
no
causal
connection
with
the
administration
of
the
statute.
there
are
many
other
things
that
they
have
alleged
here
that
they
have
passed
her
that
have
no
causal
connection
with
the
administration
of
the
statute
and
we
would
like
to
touch
on
the
lack
of
jurisdiction
here
and
mootness
and
one
of
the
basis
of
the
lower
court's
decision.
here,
this
plaintiff
has
not
alleged
that
he
was
about
to
be
called
or
that
he
has
been
called
or
that
he
was
being
investigated
or
it
was
about
to
be
investigated.
he
has
said
that
he
was
suing
as
a
member
of
a
class
and
he
hasn't
even
alleged
so
far
as
we
can
read
his
petition
that
any
members
of
the
labor
union
that
he
belonged
to
were
subpoenaed
or
were
about
to
be
subpoenaed
or
were
being
investigated.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
no
sir,
he
does
not.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
that's
not
in
the
record.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
no
sir.
the
--
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
well,
i
won't
say
that.
he
has
said
that
the
labor
management
commission
in
conspiracy
with
the
district
attorney
filed
these
charges
against
him.
now,
if
you
can
eek
out
to
that
that
was
the
commission
doing
it
as
something
else
but
that's
the
only
allegation.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
no
sir.
there's
nothing
to
that
effect
here.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
nothing
in
the
record.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
nothing
in
the
record.
he
is
a
stranger
to
these
proceedings
and
if
the
court
were
to
grant
the
injunction
it
would
not
help
him
in
accordance
with
the
record.
we
repeat
again
that
this
commission
--
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
only
the
broad
term
conspiracy
sir
but
when
he
gives
any
factual
connection,
he
talks
about
this
murder
business
and
these
charges
filed
by
the
district
attorney
and
other
charges
such
as
someone
being
arrested
by
--
the
search
warrant
by
an
arrest
warrant
and
searched
by
a
search
warrant
in
a
flamboyant
manner
such
as
that
but
there
is
nothing
here
to
tie
in
the
procedures
that
he
has
and
he
calls
in
connection
with
the
administration
of
the
statute.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
well,
only
that
broad
statement
but
all
of
the
facts
that
he
alleged
none
of
the
facts
have
any
causal
connection.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
well,
he
does
make
the
statement
as
you
have
quoted
but
then
in
an
explanation
of
it,
he
goes
on
and
sets
out
all
the
facts
and
we
take
it
that
those
are
the
--
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
i
wouldn't
say
he
purports
it
set
out
all
the
facts,
no
sir.
i'm
incorrect
in
that.
he
sets
out
the
facts
that
are
in
the
petition,
all
the
facts
that
are
in
this
petition
as
amended.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
i
would
think
that
my
recollection,
i
don't
--
that's
not
in
the
record
but
the
recollect
--
my
recollection
is
that
the
--
one
of
the
big
problems
was
the
jurisdictional
problem
between
electricians
and
the
teamsters
and
he
is
one
of
the
members
of
one
of
those
unions.
yes.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
yes,
the
teamsters.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
yes,
on
that
basis.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
well,
of
course
now
that's
the
only
one
side.
the
accusations
were
quite
broad
and
long
that
there
were
many
industrial
people
who
brought
this
unto
the
employer.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
well,
no
sir.
it
only
says
that
there
are
industrial
shutdown
and
affecting
thousands
of
people
in
this
community
and
in
the
construction
of
industrials
plants.
yes
sir,
that's
what
it
says.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
no
sir.
well,
i'm
not
saying
that
--
i've
not
said
that
--
not
intended
to
say
that
the
labor
union
of
the
teamsters
were
not
included
in
the
investigations
and
not
included
for
the
real
basis
for
having
enacted
the
statute
but
there
were
many
other
facets
to
it
and
the
statute
did
not
attempt
to
spell
out
which
particular
one
or
the
numerous
ones
that
they
were
relying
on.
it
just
says,
we
have
this
bad
situation.
we
need
to
get
statewide
power
of
investigation
and
we
need
to
have
some
assistance
to
the
grand
juries
and
to
the
district
attorneys.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
there
was
a
report
filed,
if
it
please
the
court,
but
it
did
not
go
into
the
any
particular
person.
it
did
say
in
generalities
and
this
is
most
--
most
of
this
is
anticlimaxal
because
the
whole
problem
has
been
tied
in
courts
such
as
this
case
and
in
time
you
get
ready
to
subpoena
a
witness,
you
have
contempt
problem
and
have
had
the
hands
more
or
less
tied.
it
has
not
functioned
as
it
was
anticipated
as
it
was
anticipated
that
it
would
function
and
probably
will
not
unless
this
court
finally
have
proof.
there
have
been
no
findings
that
any
particular
person
was
guilty
of
anything.
there
have
been
no
findings
as
to
such
as
that.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
yes
sir.
there
was
one
on
my
recollection
that
not
too
far
long
back
and
that
could
be
available
and
we'd
be
happy
to
make
it
available
if
the
court
desires.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
they
held
some
--
originally,
they
have
not
held
any
since
the
time
of
this
case.
in
my
recollection,
they
have
not
held
a
public
hearing.
i
could
be
wrong
but
i
think
i'm
not
that
when
these
injunctions
started
issuing,
they
have
not
held
another
public
hearing
since
then.
well,
we
have
one
in
the
martone
case.
it
came
up
through
the
state
courts.
well,
thank
you.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
well,
the
commission
could
not
have
--
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
no
sir.
my
understanding,
the
commission
has
no
authority
whatsoever
to
file
any
information
such
as
out
against
a
man.
we
have
cited
in
our
brief,
and
only
the
district
attorney
can
do
that
or
the
grand
jury.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
in
conspiracy,
yes.
in
conspiracy
but
--
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
but
as
what
he
said,
that
we
--
our
answer
is
that
they
have
no
authority
to
do
that.
they
have
no
authority
to
do
that.
they
have
no
control
over
the
district
attorney.
they
have
nothing
more
than
the
right
of
any
citizen
to
go
down
and
complain
against
somebody.
now
--
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
oh
yes,
that
they
could
conspire
to
such
as
that
but
only
the
district
attorney
can
make
that
decision,
only
the
grand
jury.
are
there
are
any
other
questions?
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
yes,
sir.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
preamble
of
this
statute
provided
that
there
have
been
a
shutdown
in
the
construction
work
in
the
vicinity
of
baton
rouge
and
that
because
of
the
great
need
for
statewide
investigatory
powers
which
they
did
not
have
at
that
time
and
to
aid
and
assist
the
district
attorneys
and
the
grand
juries
and
then
law
enforcement
officers
enacted
this
legislation
in
order
to
create
this
investigatory
commission.
faced
off
it
specifically
provided
that
the
commission
should
not
make
any
adjudication
as
to
the
guilt
and
innocence
or
as
to
(inaudible)
property
rights
just
as
what's
held
in
hannah
versus
larche.
the
--
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
a
legal
adjudication.
they
can
make
findings,
yes
sir.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
no
sir.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
they
have
no
authority
to
accuse
anyone
just
as
in
the
civil
rights
commission.
that
commission
have
authority
to
make
findings
and
so
that
this
commission
have
the
authority
to
make
findings.
in
addition
to
that,
they
went
further
and
spelled
out
the
words
that
the
counsel
placed
on.
it
says,
it
may
include
in
its
findings
general
conclusions
or
particular
inclusions
as
to
particular
individuals.
i
may
not
have
the
exact
words
but
that
was
what
it
could
include
in
its
findings
but
the
--
the
words
--
yes
sir,
the
statute
does
say
so
but
of
course
all
public
reports
such
as
this
report
on
the
civil
rights
commission
would
have
been
filed
and
then
publicized
by
being
made
public.
this
report
of
this
commission
was
to
be
filed
with
the
legislature
and
the
governor
and
of
course
would
have
made
it
publicized
also.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
the
only
object
i
could
understand
from
their
statute,
if
it
please
the
court,
is
that
they
especially
wanted
everything
into
public's
eye
with
reference
to
this.
it
was
embroiled
the
community
in
such
a
tremendous
matter
that
they
wanted
everything
out
in
open
in
public.
that's
the
reason
they
required
all
the
hearings
to
be
heard
public
and
then
--
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
yes.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
that's
exactly
correct
sir.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
they
were
supposed
to
make
findings
and
that
provided
they
made
include
in
those
findings
particular
individuals
retake
--
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
yes,
that's
exactly
sir.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
yes
sir.
well,
i
don't
know
about
the
--
i
wouldn't
want
to
answer
that
right
off
but
the
civil
rights
commission
statute
does
provide
that
they
make
findings
and
i'm
reading
from
1975.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
yes,
the
civil
rights
commission
limited
to
voting
denials
and
in
that
respect
they
are
similar,
yes
sir.
its
investigation
in
that
--
in
hannah
versus
larche,
there
was
the
same
contention
made
that
they
would
publicize
and
hold
these
people
up
to
scorn
because
of
having
committed
some
crime
and
repressions
to
the
voting
thing
and
that's
the
same
identical
argument
we
made
here.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
no
sir,
i
didn't
intend
to
say
sir.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
no
sir
and
if
i
did
i'm
sorry.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
well,
it
could
be
that
judge
but
i
--
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
well,
i
would
say
as
exactly
what
the
civil
rights
commission
was.
it
had
a
right
to
have
hearings
--
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
well,
that's
exactly
right.
it
has
a
right
to
hold
hearings,
make
investigations
report
to
the
legislature
and
to
the
governor
and
it
may
include
in
its
report
particularly
individuals,
yes
sir.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
yes
sir.
under
the
statute,
they're
entitled
to
just
as
in
the
civil
rights
commission
to
be
accompanied
by
an
attorney
but
he
is
not
given
the
right
to
cross
examine
the
other
witnesses
without
the
commission's
--
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
no
sir,
it
is
not.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
yes,
sir.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
they
--
those
in
authority
or
prosecution,
yes
that
they
can
give
the
information
to
him.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
well,
this
commission
cannot
do
anything
to
deprive
him
of
any
of
his
rights
at
all.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
same
way
with
the
grand
jury,
yes,
sir.
they
can
find
him
--
they
could
charge
him
or
say
that
that
is
their
opinion
and
that
would
be
far
greater
than
this
proceeding.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
you're
certainly
correct,
yes
sir.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
this
is
a
public
hearing,
yes
sir.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
finding,
yes
sir.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
it
could
be,
yes
sir.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
yes
sir,
on
commission.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
well,
i
wouldn't
say
so,
no
more
than
any
other
commission,
no
more
than
any
other
legislative
commission
or
committee,
they
can
make
observations.
the
statute
says
to
make
findings
and
that's
whatever
the
legislative
commission
--
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
well,
i
would
think
that
would
be
sufficient
judgment.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
they
could
find
--
that
would
be
a
finding.
a
finding
would
encompass
such
--
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
well,
if
we
have
a
situation
as
we
have
here
with
these
conditions
going
on
and
with
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
attorneys
and
the
grand
juries
limited
to
parish
limits,
they
needed
something
because
this
industrial
complex
encompass
far
more
than
one
or
two
parishes.
they
needed
some
help.
what
were
they
to
do?
they
certainly
publicize
by
making
everything
public.
the
public
of
course
could
judge
very
well
if
anyone
was
doing
something
unfair
then
i
think
that
was
one
of
the
statutory
features
of
this
statute
was
public
and
not
private.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
he's
appointed
by
the
governor,
sir.
it
has
to
be
free
from
labor,
free
from
management,
and
free
from
the
public.
it
did
include
the
dean
of
the
two
university
law
schools
who
were
chairman;
the
dean
of
louisiana
state
university
was
vice
chairman.
yes
sir,
he
accepted
and
served
both
have
since
resigned
or
not
with
it
anymore.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
both
of
them,
yes
sir.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
well,
yes
sir.
both
of
them
actually
accepted
and
served.
dean
morgan
who
was
chairman
and
dean
abe
was
vice-chairman.
until
recently,
there
have
been
no
hearings
since
those
two
have
stepped
down.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
they
were
more
or
less
spelled
out
in
the
statute
that
they
had
to
do
exactly
what
they
did
in
the
civil
rights
commission.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
not
that
i
know
of
any
difference
from
those
in
the
statute.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
i'm
sure
they
have
sir,
that's
not
in
the
record.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
that's
the
general
duty
and
obligations
of
the
state
police.
anytime
they
needed
help,
these
could
be
assigned
to
the
state
police
at
that
time
the
police
--
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
under
--
yes,
under
those
circumstances.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
i'm
sure
it
has,
yes
sir.
this
commission
--
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
no
sir,
no
sir.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
well,
with
reference
to
the
procedures
here,
they're
identical
with
the
civil
rights
commission.
the
court
below
said
the
procedures
were
drafted
with
the
civil
rights
commission
as
a
model.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
no,
sir.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
no
responsibility.
in
this
one,
they
do
have
the
authority
to
file
with
--
sir?
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
to
file
with
--
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
sir?
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
not
that
i
know
of
sir.
not
the
commission,
no
sir.
no
sir,
not
that
i
know
of.
the
commission
hasn't
been
overly
successful.
the
--
i
would
like
to
answer
some
other
questions
that
have
been
raised
here,
with
reference
--
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
no
sir
i
do
not
think
so.
my
understanding
dean
morgan
was
already
retired
from
another
position
and
he
wanted
some
peace.
he
just
served
temporarily
in
my
understanding
at
the
behest
of
the
government
until
this
investigation
of
baton
rouge
business
was
over
with
and
that
with
and
after
that
he
had
stepped
down
and
the
same
way
with
dean
morgan.
and
it
was
quite
different
from
the
three
labor
members,
they
resigned
for
other
purposes
because
of
civil
service
argument
i
believe.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
nine.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
well,
i
know
that
dean
morgan
and
dean
abe
have
resigned
and
three
labor
members
they
resigned
and
i
believe
so,
subsequently
here
recently,
the
governor
haven't
accepted
their
resignation
so
they
came
back
and
they
have
now
been
holding
some
executive
meetings.
i
do
not
know.
i
do
not
represent
the
labor
management
commission.
i'm
just
handling
this
litigation
and
i'm
not
familiar
with
what
they
are
doing
in
such
as
it.
we
would
like
to
say
that
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
that
any
of
these
charges
against
mr.
jenkins
were
filed
by
this
commission
that
is
the
assault
charges.
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
his
--
the
allegation
that
was
read
was
that
these
charges
in
conspi
--
were
filed
in
conspiracy
with
the
commission.
the
affidavit
of
mr.
george
with
reference
to
the
murder
count
is
quite
different
i
think
than
saying
that
he
had
made
that
allegation.
he
says
that
he
was
advised
that
these
various
men
could
be
shot
and
killed
by
members
of
the
labor
--
by
members
of
the
commission
of
inquiry
at
the
slightest
provocation
and
the
amount
of
it
would
make
it
appear
to
be
an
act
of
self
defense
and
we
would
like
to
add
here
that
all
of
the
allegations
with
reference
to
the
administration
of
the
statute
and
we've
argued
it
at
length
in
our
brief
have
no
causal
connection
with
the
administration
of
the
statute.
they
charge
for
example
that
mr.
jenkins
himself
was
filed
on
by
the
district
attorney
that
has
no
causal
connection
with
the
commission
because
they
can't
do
that
and
it's
not
that
they
did
it.
he
does
not
allege
that.
the
causal
connection
is
lacking
to
where
they
say
that
the
commission
is
threatened
to
kill
these
six
people.
that
has
no
causal
connection
with
the
administration
of
the
statute.
there
are
many
other
things
that
they
have
alleged
here
that
they
have
passed
her
that
have
no
causal
connection
with
the
administration
of
the
statute
and
we
would
like
to
touch
on
the
lack
of
jurisdiction
here
and
mootness
and
one
of
the
basis
of
the
lower
court's
decision.
here,
this
plaintiff
has
not
alleged
that
he
was
about
to
be
called
or
that
he
has
been
called
or
that
he
was
being
investigated
or
it
was
about
to
be
investigated.
he
has
said
that
he
was
suing
as
a
member
of
a
class
and
he
hasn't
even
alleged
so
far
as
we
can
read
his
petition
that
any
members
of
the
labor
union
that
he
belonged
to
were
subpoenaed
or
were
about
to
be
subpoenaed
or
were
being
investigated.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
no
sir,
he
does
not.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
that's
not
in
the
record.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
no
sir.
the
--
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
well,
i
won't
say
that.
he
has
said
that
the
labor
management
commission
in
conspiracy
with
the
district
attorney
filed
these
charges
against
him.
now,
if
you
can
eek
out
to
that
that
was
the
commission
doing
it
as
something
else
but
that's
the
only
allegation.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
no
sir.
there's
nothing
to
that
effect
here.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
nothing
in
the
record.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
nothing
in
the
record.
he
is
a
stranger
to
these
proceedings
and
if
the
court
were
to
grant
the
injunction
it
would
not
help
him
in
accordance
with
the
record.
we
repeat
again
that
this
commission
--
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
only
the
broad
term
conspiracy
sir
but
when
he
gives
any
factual
connection,
he
talks
about
this
murder
business
and
these
charges
filed
by
the
district
attorney
and
other
charges
such
as
someone
being
arrested
by
--
the
search
warrant
by
an
arrest
warrant
and
searched
by
a
search
warrant
in
a
flamboyant
manner
such
as
that
but
there
is
nothing
here
to
tie
in
the
procedures
that
he
has
and
he
calls
in
connection
with
the
administration
of
the
statute.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
well,
only
that
broad
statement
but
all
of
the
facts
that
he
alleged
none
of
the
facts
have
any
causal
connection.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
well,
he
does
make
the
statement
as
you
have
quoted
but
then
in
an
explanation
of
it,
he
goes
on
and
sets
out
all
the
facts
and
we
take
it
that
those
are
the
--
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
i
wouldn't
say
he
purports
it
set
out
all
the
facts,
no
sir.
i'm
incorrect
in
that.
he
sets
out
the
facts
that
are
in
the
petition,
all
the
facts
that
are
in
this
petition
as
amended.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
i
would
think
that
my
recollection,
i
don't
--
that's
not
in
the
record
but
the
recollect
--
my
recollection
is
that
the
--
one
of
the
big
problems
was
the
jurisdictional
problem
between
electricians
and
the
teamsters
and
he
is
one
of
the
members
of
one
of
those
unions.
yes.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
yes,
the
teamsters.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
yes,
on
that
basis.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
well,
of
course
now
that's
the
only
one
side.
the
accusations
were
quite
broad
and
long
that
there
were
many
industrial
people
who
brought
this
unto
the
employer.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
well,
no
sir.
it
only
says
that
there
are
industrial
shutdown
and
affecting
thousands
of
people
in
this
community
and
in
the
construction
of
industrials
plants.
yes
sir,
that's
what
it
says.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
no
sir.
well,
i'm
not
saying
that
--
i've
not
said
that
--
not
intended
to
say
that
the
labor
union
of
the
teamsters
were
not
included
in
the
investigations
and
not
included
for
the
real
basis
for
having
enacted
the
statute
but
there
were
many
other
facets
to
it
and
the
statute
did
not
attempt
to
spell
out
which
particular
one
or
the
numerous
ones
that
they
were
relying
on.
it
just
says,
we
have
this
bad
situation.
we
need
to
get
statewide
power
of
investigation
and
we
need
to
have
some
assistance
to
the
grand
juries
and
to
the
district
attorneys.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
there
was
a
report
filed,
if
it
please
the
court,
but
it
did
not
go
into
the
any
particular
person.
it
did
say
in
generalities
and
this
is
most
--
most
of
this
is
anticlimaxal
because
the
whole
problem
has
been
tied
in
courts
such
as
this
case
and
in
time
you
get
ready
to
subpoena
a
witness,
you
have
contempt
problem
and
have
had
the
hands
more
or
less
tied.
it
has
not
functioned
as
it
was
anticipated
as
it
was
anticipated
that
it
would
function
and
probably
will
not
unless
this
court
finally
have
proof.
there
have
been
no
findings
that
any
particular
person
was
guilty
of
anything.
there
have
been
no
findings
as
to
such
as
that.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
yes
sir.
there
was
one
on
my
recollection
that
not
too
far
long
back
and
that
could
be
available
and
we'd
be
happy
to
make
it
available
if
the
court
desires.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
they
held
some
--
originally,
they
have
not
held
any
since
the
time
of
this
case.
in
my
recollection,
they
have
not
held
a
public
hearing.
i
could
be
wrong
but
i
think
i'm
not
that
when
these
injunctions
started
issuing,
they
have
not
held
another
public
hearing
since
then.
well,
we
have
one
in
the
martone
case.
it
came
up
through
the
state
courts.
well,
thank
you.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
well,
the
commission
could
not
have
--
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
no
sir.
my
understanding,
the
commission
has
no
authority
whatsoever
to
file
any
information
such
as
out
against
a
man.
we
have
cited
in
our
brief,
and
only
the
district
attorney
can
do
that
or
the
grand
jury.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
in
conspiracy,
yes.
in
conspiracy
but
--
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
but
as
what
he
said,
that
we
--
our
answer
is
that
they
have
no
authority
to
do
that.
they
have
no
authority
to
do
that.
they
have
no
control
over
the
district
attorney.
they
have
nothing
more
than
the
right
of
any
citizen
to
go
down
and
complain
against
somebody.
now
--
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
oh
yes,
that
they
could
conspire
to
such
as
that
but
only
the
district
attorney
can
make
that
decision,
only
the
grand
jury.
are
there
are
any
other
questions?
thank
you,
sir.
