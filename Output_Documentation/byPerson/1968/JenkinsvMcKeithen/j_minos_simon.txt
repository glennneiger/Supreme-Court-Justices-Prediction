mr.
j.
minos
simon
yes.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
case
presents
for
the
consideration
of
the
court,
the
validity
of
the
state
statute
enacted
by
the
1967
legislative
session
of
louisiana
and
the
issues
presented
are
composed
and
framed
by
the
pleadings
in
as
much
as
the
lawsuit
instituted
by
the
plaintiff
was
dismissed
in
connection
with
a
motion
to
dismiss
filed
by
the
defendants
in
this
case.
the
decisions
relies
upon
the
holding
of
this
court
in
the
case
of
hannah
versus
larche
which
involved
an
interpretation
of
the
commission
on
civil
rights
or
the
civil
rights
commission
that
was
enacted
by
congress
recently
and
also
partly
relies
upon
a
decision
of
the
highest
court
of
the
state
of
louisiana
interpreting
or
given
its
own
interpretation
of
what
this
court
held
in
what
is
the
effect
of
the
particular
statute
in
question.
and
that
decision
was
made,
rendered
in
martone
versus
morgan
which
is
before
this
court
on
rehearing.
it's
docketed
on
--
under
number
216
of
the
1968
term
of
the
court.
the
plaintiff
in
substance
complains
that
the
act
as
a
matter
of
law
is
unconstitutional
and
also
as
administered
against
him.
the
plaintiff
alleges
that
he
is
a
member
of
a
trade
union
and
that
the
act
in
question
has
been
administered
discriminatorily
against
him
and
members
of
the
union
in
question
resulting
in
repressive
action.
i
submit
to
your
honors
that
the
hannah
decision
did
not
involve
the
type
of
legislation
that
is
involved
in
the
case
before
you.
and
i
think
perhaps
a
very
quick
reference
to
the
essential
structure
of
the
commission
that
was
created
by
this
act
as
well
as
its
function
we
illustrate
the
point
that
i
am
emphasizing
at
this
time.
the
act
was
passed
as
an
emergency
act
in
the
state
of
louisiana
and
apparently
resting
under
the
allegation
that
there
were
some
labor
strife
in
the
community
of
the
state
capital
of
louisiana.
now,
the
legislator
in
the
enactment
of
the
statute
created
what
is
designated
as
the
labor
management
commission
of
inquiry.
significantly,
this
agency
or
this
commission
operates
in
an
ad
hoc
basis.
it
operates
only
when
the
governor
of
the
state
demands
or
request
that
it
operates
and
it
investigates
only
in
that
area
outlined
and
delineated
by
the
governor
himself
in
requesting
the
investigation.
it's
significant
to
point
out
that
all
of
the
officials
of
the
state
governor
from
the
top
to
the
very
bottom,
every
employee,
every
agency,
every
department,
every
commission
are
impressed
to
do
cooperative
service
with
the
members
of
this
commission
by
virtue
of
the
provisions
of
section
880.6
sub-paragraph
(d).
i
should
like
to
also
emphasize
that
the
investigative
forces
of
the
commission
can
be
assigned
to
the
state
police
and
during
that
assignment,
they
have
all
the
powers
of
state
police.
the
commission
itself
has
endowed
itself
or
has
been
endowed
with
plenary
powers
of
subpoena.
it
could
take
depositions
anywhere
in
the
united
states
and
also
it
may
compel
obedience
to
its
orders
through
the
process
of
contempt
proceedings.
equally
significant
is
a
fact
that
this
commission
expressly
does
not
have
any
power
or
authority
or
jurisdiction
to
investigate
the
whole
hearings
or
seek
to
ascertain
the
facts
or
make
any
reports
or
recommendations
as
to
any
of
the
strictly
civil
aspect
of
any
labor
problem
or
dispute.
it
is
limited
exclusively
to
the
--
to
investigating
and
determining
the
existence
of
any
criminal
law
violations
both
of
the
state
and
the
federal
laws
that
may
occur
in
the
area
of
labor
management
relations.
not
only
this,
but
it
must
conduct
public
hearings
as
to
any
such
inquiry.
it
can
conduct
or
hold
executive
sessions
but
then
only
on
the
request
of
one
commission
member
who
in
his
opinion
may
feel
that
there
may
be
a
defamatory
content
or
incriminatory
content
to
the
investigation.
however,
it
has
full
powers
i
stated
to
bring
all
witnesses
before
it,
to
interrogate
these
witnesses
as
to
the
existence
of
any
crime
whether
they
are
of
federal
or
state
origin.
these
hearings
must
be
public
and
furthermore,
it
is
charged
with
the
responsibility
of
making
findings
and
these
findings
relate
to
the
existence
of
or
probable
existence
of
criminal
law
violations
and
also
to
pronouncing
official
judgment
when
individuals
who
may
be
involved
in
the
criminal
law
violation
in
question
relating
to
labor
management
offense.
not
only
is
this
commission
under
the
mandatory
duty
of
making
these
public
findings
but
in
addition
to
that,
this
commission
is
under
the
mandatory
duty
of
publicizing
these
findings.
so
that
and
then
furthermore,
after
it
has
conducted
these
public
hearings,
after
they
had
made
these
public
findings
and
after
there's
publicize
these
public
findings,
it
then
becomes
its
mandatory
duty
to
report
its
findings
and
recommendations
to
â€œproper
federal
and
state
authorities
charged
of
the
responsibility
for
prosecution
of
criminal
offenses."
i
submit
your
honors
that
this
piece
of
legislation
establishes
a
public
body
that
has:
one,
an
accusatory
function;
two,
that
it
must
make
and
it
can
make
official
or
pronounced
official
judgments
on
individual
and
that
it
must
publicized
both
the
findings
as
to
the
existence
or
probable
existence
of
criminal
conduct
and
as
to
the
individuals
who
may
be
involved
and
that
furthermore,
that
this
is
the
part
of
a
criminal
process.
now,
essentially,
it
is
an
inquiry
and
to
blame
workers
if
the
authorities
or
the
authorities
charged
of
the
responsibility
of
instituting
criminal
proceedings
themselves
should
not
decide
to
do
so.
the
commission
has
the
authority
to
direct
the
chairman
to
proceed
directly
with
the
filing
of
such
criminal
charges
both
of
the
federal
and
the
state
authority.
and
also
the
commission
may
request
to
the
governor,
request
the
attorney
general
to
utilize
all
the
powers
of
its
office
in
the
supervision
of
all
the
district
attorney
throughout
the
state
to
carry
out
the
recommendations
and
the
findings
made
by
--
mr.
j.
minos
simon
the
case
is
not
in
the
technical
sense
of
the
word.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
that's
correct
your
honor.
of
course,
my
position
is
by
then
that's
somewhat
in
anticlimactic
because
the
individual
involved
has
already
been
found
guilty
by
the
commission
and
his
guilt
it
was
preceded
by
a
public
hearing
where
--
mr.
j.
minos
simon
i'm
sure
it
doesn't
bind
the
law
enforcement
official
technically.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
it
doesn't
even
bind
him
to
file
a
charge
but
i'm
sure
that
in
the
ordinary
affairs
of
public
government
where
that
same
district
attorney
by
virtue
of
the
provisions
of
the
statute
himself
is
impressed
cooperatively
as
a
member
of
this
commission.
in
other
words,
he
must
cooperate
with
his
commission.
every
state
or
officer,
every
employee
of
the
state
of
louisiana
are
impressed
cooperatively
into
service
with
this
commission.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
yes,
sir,
louisiana
does.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
murder
is
one
of
them.
capital
offenses
require
that
otherwise,
the
district
attorney
may
file
charges
involving
anything
short
of
capital
offenses.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
i'm
sure
that's
a
possibility,
your
honor.
but
as
a
practical
matter,
with
all
of
the
prior
publicity
with
the
public
condemnation
that
attaches
to
the
individual
and
to
the
crime
involved
--
mr.
j.
minos
simon
it
would
be
my
judgment
but
it
would
be
hazardous
position
for
him
to
assume.
he
would
have
to
be
very
courageous,
independent-minded
public
prosecutor
to
resist
and
repel
the
force
that
would
be
generated
by
all
these
prior
publicity
because
this
is
an
open
hearing.
while
the
commission
may
conduct
executive
hearings,
it
cannot
refer
to
that
or
use
that
evidence
as
part
of
its
findings
unless
all
that
evidence
heard
in
executive
hearing
is
heard
anew
in
a
public
hearing,
and
of
course
during
these
public
hearings,
you
have
the
television
people,
they
are
with
their
cameras
writing
their
way
and
publicizing
all
that
is
going
on
before
the
commission.
and
furthermore,
there
are
no
effective
rules
of
evidence,
of
meaningful
rules
of
evidence.
the
commission
hears
anything,
hearsay
evidence,
opinion
evidence,
innuendos,
just
anything
it
chooses
to
hear
it
hears
because
there's
nothing
to
regulate
the
scope
and
the
character
of
the
evidence
which
it
brought
forth.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
not
--
no
sir,
he
wasn't
summoned.
the
companion
party
in
this
litigation
was
in
the
lower
court
if
your
honor
please.
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
jenkins'
interest
is
number
one,
that
he
is
a
member
of
the
labor
union
which
has
been
singled
out
by
the
officials
who
have
administered
this
act.
the
pleadings
will
indicate
that
your
honor
and
i
stated
the
issues
are
composed
and
framed
by
the
pleadings.
this
was
dismissed
on
a
motion
by
the
defense
to
dismiss.
the
pleadings
state
that
he
is
a
member
of
teamsters
local
union
no.5.
yes,
in
our
investigation
if
your
honor
please,
he
has
been
charged
with
four
separate
offenses
in
connection
with
the
investigations
and
he
charges
all
--
pardon
your
honor.
the
charge
was
in
the
name
of
the
district
attorney
of
one
of
the
parishes
of
louisiana.
however,
it
was
initiated
by
the
attorney
general
who
was
acting
in
cooperation
wit
the
labor
management
commission
of
inquiry.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
yes
sir,
essentially.
yes
sir.
the
rationale
of
the
entire
investigation,
if
your
honor
please.
and
furthermore,
he
charges
that
that
these
charges
against
him,
if
your
honor
please,
were
knowingly
--
were
filed
by
the
officials
when
they
knew
that
they
were
false
charges
and
they
knew
that
he
was
not
involved.
he
has
attempted
to
get
a
hearing
before
the
state
courts
of
louisiana
and
he
has
been
unsuccessful
and
that's
all
that
were
cited
in
this
matter.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
i
have
--
i
think
the
implicit
important
pleading
is
that
he
will
be
--
mr.
j.
minos
simon
well,
he
didn't
allege
that
he
had
been
--
that
he
had
done
something
or
something
that
happened
which
actually
did
not
occur,
if
your
honor
please.
but
what
he
does
allege
which
is
of
great
significance,
i
think,
is
that
this
commission
has
embarked
upon
a
course
of
conduct
designed
in
purpose
to
destroy
the
labor
union
to
which
he
belongs
by
maligning
it,
by
maligning
its
members,
scandalizing
them,
by
attempting
to
destroy
this
labor
union
and
discredit
all
of
its
members.
now,
i
think
your
honors
have
recognized
in
your
several
decisions
that
the
right
to
belong
to
a
labor
union
is
a
constitutionally
protected
right
under
the
first
amendment.
and
furthermore,
i
think
you've
held
that
the
right
to
belong
to
a
--
or
to
belong
to
an
association
and
the
right
to
be
free
from
defamation
is
also
a
constitutional
protective
right
that
one
has
and
to
that
extent
then
we
show
injury
to
a
constitutionally
protected
right.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
pardon,
sir?
i'm
sorry.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
i
don't
know
that
i
interpreted
the
decision
of
this
court
that
way
but
in
the
joint
anti-fascist
committee
decision
of
this
court,
i
think
the
court
expressly
held
--
mr.
j.
minos
simon
it's
not
alleged
but
i
think,
he
did
at
one
time,
your
honor.
i'm
not
certain.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
no
sir,
it
isn't
alleged.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
it's
greater
in
the
sense
that
he
has
been
directly
attacked.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
pardon,
sir?
mr.
j.
minos
simon
oh!
yes,
sir.
there
are
many
others.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
well
because
he's
--
he
has
individually
been
attacked,
if
your
honor
please,
because
his
right
to
belong
to
a
union
has
been
impaired.
his
right
to
have
a
collective
security
of
association
in
his
economic
existence
has
been
impaired
and
is
threatened
to
be
destroyed.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
yes
sir,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
pardon,
your
honor?
mr.
j.
minos
simon
well
--
mr.
j.
minos
simon
it
expressly
--
mr.
j.
minos
simon
yes
sir,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
we
have
a
supplemental
complaint
also.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
may
i
point
out
paragraph
10
of
the
original
complaint.
the
complainant
alleges
that
there
is
no
facts
or
legal
basis
whatever
for
the
filing
of
such
criminal
charges
against
your
complaint.
complainant
alleges
that
such
criminal
charges
were
filed
against
him
to
inflict
summary
punishment
upon
the
complainant
solely
because
he
is
a
member
of
teamster
local
union
no.
5
and
accepted
from
there
--
mr.
j.
minos
simon
no,
sir
it's
not
in
the
ordinary
way.
as
a
result
of
the
conspiracy,
alleged
conspiracy
among
the
employees
and
representatives
of
this
labor
management
commission
of
inquiry
whom
it
is
alleged
have
singled
out
this
particular
union
for
repressive
action.
furthermore,
we
allege
in
the
supplemental
petition
that
they
have
singled
out
six
officers
of
the
union
for
murder.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
yes.
and
we
have
a
supporting
affidavit
from
an
undercover
agent
of
the
labor
management
commission
of
inquiry
that
we
attach
to
the
supplemental
petition.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
we
have
--
there
are
--
i
can't
recall
them
by
name
your
honor
but
--
mr.
j.
minos
simon
yes,
two
--
one
dean
of
a
law
school.
i
think
the
chairman
was
another
dean
of
law
school,
he
was
a
banker.
in
fact,
the
lower
court
commented
on
the
fact
that
they
were
involved
and
the
implication
was
that
because
of
their
position,
it
was
unlikely
that
they
would
engage
in
a
conduct
described
in
the
complaint
which
suggest
that
this
is
a
--
mr.
j.
minos
simon
well,
of
course,
we
speak
also
of
vicarious
liability,
if
your
honor
please,
because
under
pape
versus
monroe,
your
honors
have
applied
the
civil
right
statute
vicariously
or
liability
of
it
vicariously
and
we
speak
of
that
context.
we
didn't
--
we
didn't
necessarily
speak
that
the
officers
were
directly
involved
but
we
have
serious
charges
and
i'm
satisfied
that
the
plaintiff
can
substantiate
these
serious
charges
with
credible
evidences
in
support
of
them.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
not
understand,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
he
was
not
--
he
was
not
called
before
this
commission
and
it
didn't
become
a
past
fact
that
he
was
denied
of
this
but
he
is
one
who
has
been
singled
out
for
this
repressive
action.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
well,
we
invoke
this
constitutional
provision
because
of
his
material
interest
in
this
litigation,
because
this
state
agency
seeks
to
destroy
his
union
and
his
membership
in
it
and
consequently
his
right
to
economic
security
and
because
they
are
daily
defaming
him
as
such
in
that
capacity.
he's
been
denied
of
a
constitutional
secured
right.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
and
therefore,
he
has
an
interest
to
challenge
the
statute
and
the
challenge
is
this
your
honor.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
the
challenge
is
that
this
commission
is
authorized:
number
one,
to
function
as
an
accusatory
body;
number
two,
to
accuse
him
and
anyone
else
of
being
a
public
--
mr.
j.
minos
simon
--
without
the
right
--
mr.
j.
minos
simon
that's
correct.
he
has
without
right
to
the
assistance
of
counsel,
without
a
right
to
examine
or
cross-examine
witnesses
appearing
before
that
commission,
without
of
course
the
right
of
having
definable
standards
of
guilt
or
innocence
before
the
pronounced
of
guilty
of
any
offense,
and
without
the
right
to
have
the
application
of
meaningful
rules
of
evidence.
i
think
implicitly,
the
hannah
decision
is
a
conclusion
by
this
court
and
certainly
the
joint
anti-fascist
committee
that
no
public
body
can
defame
an
individual
in
this
manner,
can
destroy
him,
unless
you
accord
to
the
individual
the
right
of
confrontation,
the
right
of
cross-examination.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
if
your
honor
please,
the
grand
jury
do
not
--
mr.
j.
minos
simon
no,
sir.
i'm
not
--
i
don't
have
that
burden.
the
grand
jury
does
not
conduct
a
public
hearing.
it
does
--
mr.
j.
minos
simon
well,
if
your
honor
please,
this
is
not
--
the
ultimate
charge
in
itself
is
not
the
gravamen
of
the
complaint.
it
is
that
there's
a
public
pronouncement
of
guilt.
one
is
branded
as
a
public
enemy,
preceded
by
a
public
hearing
where
persons
are
sworn.
whether
there's
no
compliance
with
the
rudiments
of
fair
play
and
due
process,
there
are
no
meaningful
rules
of
evidence
and
then
after
he
is
found
guilty
as
such
and
that
guilt
is
publicized.
and
that
guilt,
and
that
finding
forms
part
of
a
process
of
a
criminal
prosecution
because
the
whole
objective,
the
whole
aim,
the
whole
purpose
of
the
hearing
is
to
bring
about
the
criminal
prosecution
of
an
individual
after
he
has
been
found
after
he
has
been
found
guilty
of
the
charge
that's
ultimately
is
alleged
against
him.
if
--
mr.
j.
minos
simon
i'm
sorry
your
honor
i
didn't
hear
you.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
i
don't
think
it
would
make
a
substantial
difference.
i
think
that
any
time
--
mr.
j.
minos
simon
no,
sir,
your
honor
because
--
mr.
j.
minos
simon
i
think
the
statute
goes
one
step
farther
than
that
if
your
honor
please.
it
not
only
states
that
this
is
what
this
commission
has
set
up
to
do,
to
investigate
whether
or
not
laws
have
been
violated
but
furthermore,
this
commission
must
make
a
public
finding.
it
must
make
findings
that
directly
affect
the
rights
of
individuals.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
naming
persons.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
i
believe
that
in
that
context
where
there's
no
purpose
to
gather
evidence
for
the
purpose
of
enacting
legislation
or
their
remedial
character
where
the
sole
function
is
to
make
an
official
for
public
judgment
as
to
guilt
or
innocence
of
citizens.
i
think
that
in
that
context,
even
if
the
legislature
is
acting,
that
the
rigorous
demands
of
due
process
must
be
complied
with,
that
the
individual
have
the
right
to
cross-examine
witnesses
and
have
a
right
to
the
effective
assistance
of
counsel
and
all
of
the
panoply
of
due
process
that
is
envisioned
by
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
--
to
the
constitution.
but
this
is
not
the
end
product
or
the
end
result
or
the
ultimate
purpose
of
this
particular
legislation.
they
go
one
step
further.
they
have
a
mandatory
inescapable
duty
of
then
proceeding
to
present
this
to
the
state
and
federal
authorities
charged
with
the
responsibility
of
instituting
criminal
proceeding.
now,
this
is
far
removed
from
legitimate
legislative
investigation
where
evidence
is
gathered.
no
formal
judgment
of
guilt
or
innocence
as
pronounced
but
evidence
is
gathered
to
be
called
and
sifted
and
to
be
considered
for
the
members
of
the
legislature
for
the
purpose
of
attempting
to
this
due
remedial
legislation.
this
is
not
involved
in
this
particular
case.
the
whole
purpose
is
to
first,
publicly
condemn
and
that's
preceded
by
a
formal
hearing
where
the
oath
is
solemnly
told
and
then
there
is
condemnation
and
not
only
condemnation
but
there
is
an
additional
step
where
the
committee,
the
executive
committee
will
then
go
forward
and
file
and
present
this
to
the
authorities
charged
with
the
prosecution
of
criminal
law
violations.
in
addition
to
this
it
has
the
authority
itself
to
go
forward
and
file
these
charges.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
what
else
must
(inaudible)?
mr.
j.
minos
simon
they
make
their
recommendation
and
their
findings
to
the
proper
authorities.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
they
publish
it
to
the
world.
no
question
about
that.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
yes,
sir.
it's
an
inescapable
mandatory
duty.
they
must
publicize
their
findings
and
all
of
the
evidence
upon
which
their
public
--
their
findings
are
based
must
themselves
be
public.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
but
i
think
this
goes
one
step
further
that
they
actually
have
the
power
to
say
who
is
guilty
and
who
is
not
guilty.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
well,
i'm
not
familiar
with
the
decision
that
your
honors
referred
to
except
to
say
that
--
mr.
j.
minos
simon
beyond
any
question,
yes.
beyond
any
question
i
think
that's
what
it
should
be
done.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
yes,
sir.
that's
correct,
sir.
that's
correct.
because
--
and
of
course,
the
result
of
harm
is
aggravated
by
the
fact
that
this
resides
exclusively
in
the
executive
branch
of
government
where
you
have
a
system
of
laws
in
the
states
and
the
other
states
where
these
matters
are
handled
either
by
the
grand
jury
in
a
private
discussion
where
no
one
publicized
as
such.
there's
no
evidence
to
show
his
guilt.
the
whole
state
of
louisiana
says
it's
a
jury
while
this
individual
is
being
formally
accused
of
crime
and
is
actually
found
guilty
of
crime.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
we
do,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
no
sir,
your
honor.
we
have
indictments.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
i'm
not
familiar
with
presentment
but
all
i
know
indictment
is
the
only
thing
we
have.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
yes
sir,
that's
in
the
amended
complaint
as
alleged.
that
investigations
for
this
commission
when
instructed
and
this
came
from
one
of
their
former
undercover
agent
when
instructed
to
shoot
named
individuals
who
killed
so
long
as
it
was
colorably
shown
that
it
was
done
as
self
defense
and
this
indeed
and
this
is
in
connection
with
the
fact
that
this
statute
gives
immunity
to
every
employee
and
every
official
and
every
agent
of
this
commission
for
anything
to
do.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
it
says
immunity
for
anything
to
do
while
the
performance
of
any
duty
assigned
to
them
and
the
statute
expressly
grants
it
to
them.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
because
hannah
was
not
an
accusatory
function,
if
your
honor
please.
hannah
did
not
involve
an
accusatory
function.
it
was
not
and
did
not
have
an
accusatory
function.
hannah
for
example
wherever
there
was
a
defamatory
content
or
an
incriminating
content,
hannah
went
into
executive
session,
it
had
to.
well,
as
this
court
said,
it
shall
go
into
executive
session
and
this
information
was
released
only
with
the
consent
of
the
commission.
the
contrary
is
true
in
this
case.
this
commission
must
conduct
public
hearing.
if
it
goes
into
executive
session,
it
cannot
utilize
what
evidence
it
has
developed
in
that
session
and
if
it
seeks
to
do
so,
it
must
represent
all
anew,
all
this
evidence
in
a
public
hearing.
there
was
some
claim.
well,
in
the
preamble
it
shows
that
there
was
a
shutdown
of
the
industrial
complex
in
the
city
of
baton
rouge
some
months
preceding
in
the
enactment
of
this
legislation
and
thus
there
was
an
emergency
created
and
this
commission
was
created.
that's
(inaudible).
thank
you.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
you
asked
me
what
they
had
--
mr.
j.
minos
simon
background.
yes
it
is.
yes
sir.
i'll
give
you
the
background,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
partin
who
heads
this
union
was
the
star
witness
who
testified
on
behalf
of
the
government
against
mr.
hoffa,
and
mr.
hoffa's
prosecution
and
his
background
there
--
the
continuing
background
of
effort
being
made
to
get
mr.
partin
to
recant
his
testimony
so
as
to
be
used
as
a
basis
to
grant
to
mr.
hoffa
a
new
trial.
there
have
been
statements
of
bribery
by
state
officials
and
otherwise
or
attempted
bribery
of
mr.
partin.
there
are
criminal
charges
pending
the
state
courts
involved
in
the
very
same
thing.
there's
adult
with
charge
who
was
attempting
to
bribe
mr.
partin
and
other
individuals
and
this
is
part
--
in
other
words,
the
effort
to
bribe
mr.
partin
apparently
from
what
is
available,
the
information
is
available.
it
includes
state
officials
and
its
part
of
an
effort
to
coerce
mr.
partin
into
recanting
his
testimony.
it
sounds
somewhat
strange
but
i
only
advocate
the
rights
of
my
client
and
that's
what
the
evidence
demonstrates.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
that's
--
that's
the
conviction
of
my
client
your
honor
and
there
seems
to
be
apparently
evidence
available
to
support
that
charge.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
the
head.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
well,
i
think
the
whole
union
is
being
damaged.
being
characterized,
the
governor
has
called
them
gangsters
and
hoodlums.
the
governor
further
asked
them
to
point
this
out.
furthermore,
the
governor
stated
that
anybody
who
would
give
testimony
in
support
of
the
conspiracy
charge
involved
in
this
particular
case
in
the
martone
case,
will
be
charge
with
perjury.
with
mr.
white,
the
undercover
agent
signed
his
affidavit,
within
30
days,
he
signed
the
affidavit
that
was
filed
in
the
federal
forum,
the
federal
district
court.
within
30
days,
a
member
of
the
commission
filed
perjury
charges
against
mr.
white's
statement
based
upon
his
allegation
that
these
people
were
involved
and
were
involved
in
the
conspiracy
to
commit
murder.
furthermore,
we
are
involved
in
the
conspiracy
of
bribing
people
and
fabricating
evidence
against
these
people.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
yes.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
case
presents
for
the
consideration
of
the
court,
the
validity
of
the
state
statute
enacted
by
the
1967
legislative
session
of
louisiana
and
the
issues
presented
are
composed
and
framed
by
the
pleadings
in
as
much
as
the
lawsuit
instituted
by
the
plaintiff
was
dismissed
in
connection
with
a
motion
to
dismiss
filed
by
the
defendants
in
this
case.
the
decisions
relies
upon
the
holding
of
this
court
in
the
case
of
hannah
versus
larche
which
involved
an
interpretation
of
the
commission
on
civil
rights
or
the
civil
rights
commission
that
was
enacted
by
congress
recently
and
also
partly
relies
upon
a
decision
of
the
highest
court
of
the
state
of
louisiana
interpreting
or
given
its
own
interpretation
of
what
this
court
held
in
what
is
the
effect
of
the
particular
statute
in
question.
and
that
decision
was
made,
rendered
in
martone
versus
morgan
which
is
before
this
court
on
rehearing.
it's
docketed
on
--
under
number
216
of
the
1968
term
of
the
court.
the
plaintiff
in
substance
complains
that
the
act
as
a
matter
of
law
is
unconstitutional
and
also
as
administered
against
him.
the
plaintiff
alleges
that
he
is
a
member
of
a
trade
union
and
that
the
act
in
question
has
been
administered
discriminatorily
against
him
and
members
of
the
union
in
question
resulting
in
repressive
action.
i
submit
to
your
honors
that
the
hannah
decision
did
not
involve
the
type
of
legislation
that
is
involved
in
the
case
before
you.
and
i
think
perhaps
a
very
quick
reference
to
the
essential
structure
of
the
commission
that
was
created
by
this
act
as
well
as
its
function
we
illustrate
the
point
that
i
am
emphasizing
at
this
time.
the
act
was
passed
as
an
emergency
act
in
the
state
of
louisiana
and
apparently
resting
under
the
allegation
that
there
were
some
labor
strife
in
the
community
of
the
state
capital
of
louisiana.
now,
the
legislator
in
the
enactment
of
the
statute
created
what
is
designated
as
the
labor
management
commission
of
inquiry.
significantly,
this
agency
or
this
commission
operates
in
an
ad
hoc
basis.
it
operates
only
when
the
governor
of
the
state
demands
or
request
that
it
operates
and
it
investigates
only
in
that
area
outlined
and
delineated
by
the
governor
himself
in
requesting
the
investigation.
it's
significant
to
point
out
that
all
of
the
officials
of
the
state
governor
from
the
top
to
the
very
bottom,
every
employee,
every
agency,
every
department,
every
commission
are
impressed
to
do
cooperative
service
with
the
members
of
this
commission
by
virtue
of
the
provisions
of
section
880.6
sub-paragraph
(d).
i
should
like
to
also
emphasize
that
the
investigative
forces
of
the
commission
can
be
assigned
to
the
state
police
and
during
that
assignment,
they
have
all
the
powers
of
state
police.
the
commission
itself
has
endowed
itself
or
has
been
endowed
with
plenary
powers
of
subpoena.
it
could
take
depositions
anywhere
in
the
united
states
and
also
it
may
compel
obedience
to
its
orders
through
the
process
of
contempt
proceedings.
equally
significant
is
a
fact
that
this
commission
expressly
does
not
have
any
power
or
authority
or
jurisdiction
to
investigate
the
whole
hearings
or
seek
to
ascertain
the
facts
or
make
any
reports
or
recommendations
as
to
any
of
the
strictly
civil
aspect
of
any
labor
problem
or
dispute.
it
is
limited
exclusively
to
the
--
to
investigating
and
determining
the
existence
of
any
criminal
law
violations
both
of
the
state
and
the
federal
laws
that
may
occur
in
the
area
of
labor
management
relations.
not
only
this,
but
it
must
conduct
public
hearings
as
to
any
such
inquiry.
it
can
conduct
or
hold
executive
sessions
but
then
only
on
the
request
of
one
commission
member
who
in
his
opinion
may
feel
that
there
may
be
a
defamatory
content
or
incriminatory
content
to
the
investigation.
however,
it
has
full
powers
i
stated
to
bring
all
witnesses
before
it,
to
interrogate
these
witnesses
as
to
the
existence
of
any
crime
whether
they
are
of
federal
or
state
origin.
these
hearings
must
be
public
and
furthermore,
it
is
charged
with
the
responsibility
of
making
findings
and
these
findings
relate
to
the
existence
of
or
probable
existence
of
criminal
law
violations
and
also
to
pronouncing
official
judgment
when
individuals
who
may
be
involved
in
the
criminal
law
violation
in
question
relating
to
labor
management
offense.
not
only
is
this
commission
under
the
mandatory
duty
of
making
these
public
findings
but
in
addition
to
that,
this
commission
is
under
the
mandatory
duty
of
publicizing
these
findings.
so
that
and
then
furthermore,
after
it
has
conducted
these
public
hearings,
after
they
had
made
these
public
findings
and
after
there's
publicize
these
public
findings,
it
then
becomes
its
mandatory
duty
to
report
its
findings
and
recommendations
to
â€œproper
federal
and
state
authorities
charged
of
the
responsibility
for
prosecution
of
criminal
offenses."
i
submit
your
honors
that
this
piece
of
legislation
establishes
a
public
body
that
has:
one,
an
accusatory
function;
two,
that
it
must
make
and
it
can
make
official
or
pronounced
official
judgments
on
individual
and
that
it
must
publicized
both
the
findings
as
to
the
existence
or
probable
existence
of
criminal
conduct
and
as
to
the
individuals
who
may
be
involved
and
that
furthermore,
that
this
is
the
part
of
a
criminal
process.
now,
essentially,
it
is
an
inquiry
and
to
blame
workers
if
the
authorities
or
the
authorities
charged
of
the
responsibility
of
instituting
criminal
proceedings
themselves
should
not
decide
to
do
so.
the
commission
has
the
authority
to
direct
the
chairman
to
proceed
directly
with
the
filing
of
such
criminal
charges
both
of
the
federal
and
the
state
authority.
and
also
the
commission
may
request
to
the
governor,
request
the
attorney
general
to
utilize
all
the
powers
of
its
office
in
the
supervision
of
all
the
district
attorney
throughout
the
state
to
carry
out
the
recommendations
and
the
findings
made
by
--
mr.
j.
minos
simon
the
case
is
not
in
the
technical
sense
of
the
word.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
that's
correct
your
honor.
of
course,
my
position
is
by
then
that's
somewhat
in
anticlimactic
because
the
individual
involved
has
already
been
found
guilty
by
the
commission
and
his
guilt
it
was
preceded
by
a
public
hearing
where
--
mr.
j.
minos
simon
i'm
sure
it
doesn't
bind
the
law
enforcement
official
technically.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
it
doesn't
even
bind
him
to
file
a
charge
but
i'm
sure
that
in
the
ordinary
affairs
of
public
government
where
that
same
district
attorney
by
virtue
of
the
provisions
of
the
statute
himself
is
impressed
cooperatively
as
a
member
of
this
commission.
in
other
words,
he
must
cooperate
with
his
commission.
every
state
or
officer,
every
employee
of
the
state
of
louisiana
are
impressed
cooperatively
into
service
with
this
commission.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
yes,
sir,
louisiana
does.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
murder
is
one
of
them.
capital
offenses
require
that
otherwise,
the
district
attorney
may
file
charges
involving
anything
short
of
capital
offenses.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
i'm
sure
that's
a
possibility,
your
honor.
but
as
a
practical
matter,
with
all
of
the
prior
publicity
with
the
public
condemnation
that
attaches
to
the
individual
and
to
the
crime
involved
--
mr.
j.
minos
simon
it
would
be
my
judgment
but
it
would
be
hazardous
position
for
him
to
assume.
he
would
have
to
be
very
courageous,
independent-minded
public
prosecutor
to
resist
and
repel
the
force
that
would
be
generated
by
all
these
prior
publicity
because
this
is
an
open
hearing.
while
the
commission
may
conduct
executive
hearings,
it
cannot
refer
to
that
or
use
that
evidence
as
part
of
its
findings
unless
all
that
evidence
heard
in
executive
hearing
is
heard
anew
in
a
public
hearing,
and
of
course
during
these
public
hearings,
you
have
the
television
people,
they
are
with
their
cameras
writing
their
way
and
publicizing
all
that
is
going
on
before
the
commission.
and
furthermore,
there
are
no
effective
rules
of
evidence,
of
meaningful
rules
of
evidence.
the
commission
hears
anything,
hearsay
evidence,
opinion
evidence,
innuendos,
just
anything
it
chooses
to
hear
it
hears
because
there's
nothing
to
regulate
the
scope
and
the
character
of
the
evidence
which
it
brought
forth.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
not
--
no
sir,
he
wasn't
summoned.
the
companion
party
in
this
litigation
was
in
the
lower
court
if
your
honor
please.
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
jenkins'
interest
is
number
one,
that
he
is
a
member
of
the
labor
union
which
has
been
singled
out
by
the
officials
who
have
administered
this
act.
the
pleadings
will
indicate
that
your
honor
and
i
stated
the
issues
are
composed
and
framed
by
the
pleadings.
this
was
dismissed
on
a
motion
by
the
defense
to
dismiss.
the
pleadings
state
that
he
is
a
member
of
teamsters
local
union
no.5.
yes,
in
our
investigation
if
your
honor
please,
he
has
been
charged
with
four
separate
offenses
in
connection
with
the
investigations
and
he
charges
all
--
pardon
your
honor.
the
charge
was
in
the
name
of
the
district
attorney
of
one
of
the
parishes
of
louisiana.
however,
it
was
initiated
by
the
attorney
general
who
was
acting
in
cooperation
wit
the
labor
management
commission
of
inquiry.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
yes
sir,
essentially.
yes
sir.
the
rationale
of
the
entire
investigation,
if
your
honor
please.
and
furthermore,
he
charges
that
that
these
charges
against
him,
if
your
honor
please,
were
knowingly
--
were
filed
by
the
officials
when
they
knew
that
they
were
false
charges
and
they
knew
that
he
was
not
involved.
he
has
attempted
to
get
a
hearing
before
the
state
courts
of
louisiana
and
he
has
been
unsuccessful
and
that's
all
that
were
cited
in
this
matter.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
i
have
--
i
think
the
implicit
important
pleading
is
that
he
will
be
--
mr.
j.
minos
simon
well,
he
didn't
allege
that
he
had
been
--
that
he
had
done
something
or
something
that
happened
which
actually
did
not
occur,
if
your
honor
please.
but
what
he
does
allege
which
is
of
great
significance,
i
think,
is
that
this
commission
has
embarked
upon
a
course
of
conduct
designed
in
purpose
to
destroy
the
labor
union
to
which
he
belongs
by
maligning
it,
by
maligning
its
members,
scandalizing
them,
by
attempting
to
destroy
this
labor
union
and
discredit
all
of
its
members.
now,
i
think
your
honors
have
recognized
in
your
several
decisions
that
the
right
to
belong
to
a
labor
union
is
a
constitutionally
protected
right
under
the
first
amendment.
and
furthermore,
i
think
you've
held
that
the
right
to
belong
to
a
--
or
to
belong
to
an
association
and
the
right
to
be
free
from
defamation
is
also
a
constitutional
protective
right
that
one
has
and
to
that
extent
then
we
show
injury
to
a
constitutionally
protected
right.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
pardon,
sir?
i'm
sorry.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
i
don't
know
that
i
interpreted
the
decision
of
this
court
that
way
but
in
the
joint
anti-fascist
committee
decision
of
this
court,
i
think
the
court
expressly
held
--
mr.
j.
minos
simon
it's
not
alleged
but
i
think,
he
did
at
one
time,
your
honor.
i'm
not
certain.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
no
sir,
it
isn't
alleged.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
it's
greater
in
the
sense
that
he
has
been
directly
attacked.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
pardon,
sir?
mr.
j.
minos
simon
oh!
yes,
sir.
there
are
many
others.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
well
because
he's
--
he
has
individually
been
attacked,
if
your
honor
please,
because
his
right
to
belong
to
a
union
has
been
impaired.
his
right
to
have
a
collective
security
of
association
in
his
economic
existence
has
been
impaired
and
is
threatened
to
be
destroyed.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
yes
sir,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
pardon,
your
honor?
mr.
j.
minos
simon
well
--
mr.
j.
minos
simon
it
expressly
--
mr.
j.
minos
simon
yes
sir,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
we
have
a
supplemental
complaint
also.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
may
i
point
out
paragraph
10
of
the
original
complaint.
the
complainant
alleges
that
there
is
no
facts
or
legal
basis
whatever
for
the
filing
of
such
criminal
charges
against
your
complaint.
complainant
alleges
that
such
criminal
charges
were
filed
against
him
to
inflict
summary
punishment
upon
the
complainant
solely
because
he
is
a
member
of
teamster
local
union
no.
5
and
accepted
from
there
--
mr.
j.
minos
simon
no,
sir
it's
not
in
the
ordinary
way.
as
a
result
of
the
conspiracy,
alleged
conspiracy
among
the
employees
and
representatives
of
this
labor
management
commission
of
inquiry
whom
it
is
alleged
have
singled
out
this
particular
union
for
repressive
action.
furthermore,
we
allege
in
the
supplemental
petition
that
they
have
singled
out
six
officers
of
the
union
for
murder.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
yes.
and
we
have
a
supporting
affidavit
from
an
undercover
agent
of
the
labor
management
commission
of
inquiry
that
we
attach
to
the
supplemental
petition.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
we
have
--
there
are
--
i
can't
recall
them
by
name
your
honor
but
--
mr.
j.
minos
simon
yes,
two
--
one
dean
of
a
law
school.
i
think
the
chairman
was
another
dean
of
law
school,
he
was
a
banker.
in
fact,
the
lower
court
commented
on
the
fact
that
they
were
involved
and
the
implication
was
that
because
of
their
position,
it
was
unlikely
that
they
would
engage
in
a
conduct
described
in
the
complaint
which
suggest
that
this
is
a
--
mr.
j.
minos
simon
well,
of
course,
we
speak
also
of
vicarious
liability,
if
your
honor
please,
because
under
pape
versus
monroe,
your
honors
have
applied
the
civil
right
statute
vicariously
or
liability
of
it
vicariously
and
we
speak
of
that
context.
we
didn't
--
we
didn't
necessarily
speak
that
the
officers
were
directly
involved
but
we
have
serious
charges
and
i'm
satisfied
that
the
plaintiff
can
substantiate
these
serious
charges
with
credible
evidences
in
support
of
them.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
not
understand,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
he
was
not
--
he
was
not
called
before
this
commission
and
it
didn't
become
a
past
fact
that
he
was
denied
of
this
but
he
is
one
who
has
been
singled
out
for
this
repressive
action.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
well,
we
invoke
this
constitutional
provision
because
of
his
material
interest
in
this
litigation,
because
this
state
agency
seeks
to
destroy
his
union
and
his
membership
in
it
and
consequently
his
right
to
economic
security
and
because
they
are
daily
defaming
him
as
such
in
that
capacity.
he's
been
denied
of
a
constitutional
secured
right.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
and
therefore,
he
has
an
interest
to
challenge
the
statute
and
the
challenge
is
this
your
honor.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
the
challenge
is
that
this
commission
is
authorized:
number
one,
to
function
as
an
accusatory
body;
number
two,
to
accuse
him
and
anyone
else
of
being
a
public
--
mr.
j.
minos
simon
--
without
the
right
--
mr.
j.
minos
simon
that's
correct.
he
has
without
right
to
the
assistance
of
counsel,
without
a
right
to
examine
or
cross-examine
witnesses
appearing
before
that
commission,
without
of
course
the
right
of
having
definable
standards
of
guilt
or
innocence
before
the
pronounced
of
guilty
of
any
offense,
and
without
the
right
to
have
the
application
of
meaningful
rules
of
evidence.
i
think
implicitly,
the
hannah
decision
is
a
conclusion
by
this
court
and
certainly
the
joint
anti-fascist
committee
that
no
public
body
can
defame
an
individual
in
this
manner,
can
destroy
him,
unless
you
accord
to
the
individual
the
right
of
confrontation,
the
right
of
cross-examination.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
if
your
honor
please,
the
grand
jury
do
not
--
mr.
j.
minos
simon
no,
sir.
i'm
not
--
i
don't
have
that
burden.
the
grand
jury
does
not
conduct
a
public
hearing.
it
does
--
mr.
j.
minos
simon
well,
if
your
honor
please,
this
is
not
--
the
ultimate
charge
in
itself
is
not
the
gravamen
of
the
complaint.
it
is
that
there's
a
public
pronouncement
of
guilt.
one
is
branded
as
a
public
enemy,
preceded
by
a
public
hearing
where
persons
are
sworn.
whether
there's
no
compliance
with
the
rudiments
of
fair
play
and
due
process,
there
are
no
meaningful
rules
of
evidence
and
then
after
he
is
found
guilty
as
such
and
that
guilt
is
publicized.
and
that
guilt,
and
that
finding
forms
part
of
a
process
of
a
criminal
prosecution
because
the
whole
objective,
the
whole
aim,
the
whole
purpose
of
the
hearing
is
to
bring
about
the
criminal
prosecution
of
an
individual
after
he
has
been
found
after
he
has
been
found
guilty
of
the
charge
that's
ultimately
is
alleged
against
him.
if
--
mr.
j.
minos
simon
i'm
sorry
your
honor
i
didn't
hear
you.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
i
don't
think
it
would
make
a
substantial
difference.
i
think
that
any
time
--
mr.
j.
minos
simon
no,
sir,
your
honor
because
--
mr.
j.
minos
simon
i
think
the
statute
goes
one
step
farther
than
that
if
your
honor
please.
it
not
only
states
that
this
is
what
this
commission
has
set
up
to
do,
to
investigate
whether
or
not
laws
have
been
violated
but
furthermore,
this
commission
must
make
a
public
finding.
it
must
make
findings
that
directly
affect
the
rights
of
individuals.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
naming
persons.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
i
believe
that
in
that
context
where
there's
no
purpose
to
gather
evidence
for
the
purpose
of
enacting
legislation
or
their
remedial
character
where
the
sole
function
is
to
make
an
official
for
public
judgment
as
to
guilt
or
innocence
of
citizens.
i
think
that
in
that
context,
even
if
the
legislature
is
acting,
that
the
rigorous
demands
of
due
process
must
be
complied
with,
that
the
individual
have
the
right
to
cross-examine
witnesses
and
have
a
right
to
the
effective
assistance
of
counsel
and
all
of
the
panoply
of
due
process
that
is
envisioned
by
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
--
to
the
constitution.
but
this
is
not
the
end
product
or
the
end
result
or
the
ultimate
purpose
of
this
particular
legislation.
they
go
one
step
further.
they
have
a
mandatory
inescapable
duty
of
then
proceeding
to
present
this
to
the
state
and
federal
authorities
charged
with
the
responsibility
of
instituting
criminal
proceeding.
now,
this
is
far
removed
from
legitimate
legislative
investigation
where
evidence
is
gathered.
no
formal
judgment
of
guilt
or
innocence
as
pronounced
but
evidence
is
gathered
to
be
called
and
sifted
and
to
be
considered
for
the
members
of
the
legislature
for
the
purpose
of
attempting
to
this
due
remedial
legislation.
this
is
not
involved
in
this
particular
case.
the
whole
purpose
is
to
first,
publicly
condemn
and
that's
preceded
by
a
formal
hearing
where
the
oath
is
solemnly
told
and
then
there
is
condemnation
and
not
only
condemnation
but
there
is
an
additional
step
where
the
committee,
the
executive
committee
will
then
go
forward
and
file
and
present
this
to
the
authorities
charged
with
the
prosecution
of
criminal
law
violations.
in
addition
to
this
it
has
the
authority
itself
to
go
forward
and
file
these
charges.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
what
else
must
(inaudible)?
mr.
j.
minos
simon
they
make
their
recommendation
and
their
findings
to
the
proper
authorities.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
they
publish
it
to
the
world.
no
question
about
that.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
yes,
sir.
it's
an
inescapable
mandatory
duty.
they
must
publicize
their
findings
and
all
of
the
evidence
upon
which
their
public
--
their
findings
are
based
must
themselves
be
public.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
but
i
think
this
goes
one
step
further
that
they
actually
have
the
power
to
say
who
is
guilty
and
who
is
not
guilty.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
well,
i'm
not
familiar
with
the
decision
that
your
honors
referred
to
except
to
say
that
--
mr.
j.
minos
simon
beyond
any
question,
yes.
beyond
any
question
i
think
that's
what
it
should
be
done.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
yes,
sir.
that's
correct,
sir.
that's
correct.
because
--
and
of
course,
the
result
of
harm
is
aggravated
by
the
fact
that
this
resides
exclusively
in
the
executive
branch
of
government
where
you
have
a
system
of
laws
in
the
states
and
the
other
states
where
these
matters
are
handled
either
by
the
grand
jury
in
a
private
discussion
where
no
one
publicized
as
such.
there's
no
evidence
to
show
his
guilt.
the
whole
state
of
louisiana
says
it's
a
jury
while
this
individual
is
being
formally
accused
of
crime
and
is
actually
found
guilty
of
crime.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
we
do,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
no
sir,
your
honor.
we
have
indictments.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
i'm
not
familiar
with
presentment
but
all
i
know
indictment
is
the
only
thing
we
have.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
yes
sir,
that's
in
the
amended
complaint
as
alleged.
that
investigations
for
this
commission
when
instructed
and
this
came
from
one
of
their
former
undercover
agent
when
instructed
to
shoot
named
individuals
who
killed
so
long
as
it
was
colorably
shown
that
it
was
done
as
self
defense
and
this
indeed
and
this
is
in
connection
with
the
fact
that
this
statute
gives
immunity
to
every
employee
and
every
official
and
every
agent
of
this
commission
for
anything
to
do.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
it
says
immunity
for
anything
to
do
while
the
performance
of
any
duty
assigned
to
them
and
the
statute
expressly
grants
it
to
them.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
because
hannah
was
not
an
accusatory
function,
if
your
honor
please.
hannah
did
not
involve
an
accusatory
function.
it
was
not
and
did
not
have
an
accusatory
function.
hannah
for
example
wherever
there
was
a
defamatory
content
or
an
incriminating
content,
hannah
went
into
executive
session,
it
had
to.
well,
as
this
court
said,
it
shall
go
into
executive
session
and
this
information
was
released
only
with
the
consent
of
the
commission.
the
contrary
is
true
in
this
case.
this
commission
must
conduct
public
hearing.
if
it
goes
into
executive
session,
it
cannot
utilize
what
evidence
it
has
developed
in
that
session
and
if
it
seeks
to
do
so,
it
must
represent
all
anew,
all
this
evidence
in
a
public
hearing.
there
was
some
claim.
well,
in
the
preamble
it
shows
that
there
was
a
shutdown
of
the
industrial
complex
in
the
city
of
baton
rouge
some
months
preceding
in
the
enactment
of
this
legislation
and
thus
there
was
an
emergency
created
and
this
commission
was
created.
that's
(inaudible).
thank
you.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
you
asked
me
what
they
had
--
mr.
j.
minos
simon
background.
yes
it
is.
yes
sir.
i'll
give
you
the
background,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
partin
who
heads
this
union
was
the
star
witness
who
testified
on
behalf
of
the
government
against
mr.
hoffa,
and
mr.
hoffa's
prosecution
and
his
background
there
--
the
continuing
background
of
effort
being
made
to
get
mr.
partin
to
recant
his
testimony
so
as
to
be
used
as
a
basis
to
grant
to
mr.
hoffa
a
new
trial.
there
have
been
statements
of
bribery
by
state
officials
and
otherwise
or
attempted
bribery
of
mr.
partin.
there
are
criminal
charges
pending
the
state
courts
involved
in
the
very
same
thing.
there's
adult
with
charge
who
was
attempting
to
bribe
mr.
partin
and
other
individuals
and
this
is
part
--
in
other
words,
the
effort
to
bribe
mr.
partin
apparently
from
what
is
available,
the
information
is
available.
it
includes
state
officials
and
its
part
of
an
effort
to
coerce
mr.
partin
into
recanting
his
testimony.
it
sounds
somewhat
strange
but
i
only
advocate
the
rights
of
my
client
and
that's
what
the
evidence
demonstrates.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
that's
--
that's
the
conviction
of
my
client
your
honor
and
there
seems
to
be
apparently
evidence
available
to
support
that
charge.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
the
head.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
well,
i
think
the
whole
union
is
being
damaged.
being
characterized,
the
governor
has
called
them
gangsters
and
hoodlums.
the
governor
further
asked
them
to
point
this
out.
furthermore,
the
governor
stated
that
anybody
who
would
give
testimony
in
support
of
the
conspiracy
charge
involved
in
this
particular
case
in
the
martone
case,
will
be
charge
with
perjury.
with
mr.
white,
the
undercover
agent
signed
his
affidavit,
within
30
days,
he
signed
the
affidavit
that
was
filed
in
the
federal
forum,
the
federal
district
court.
within
30
days,
a
member
of
the
commission
filed
perjury
charges
against
mr.
white's
statement
based
upon
his
allegation
that
these
people
were
involved
and
were
involved
in
the
conspiracy
to
commit
murder.
furthermore,
we
are
involved
in
the
conspiracy
of
bribing
people
and
fabricating
evidence
against
these
people.
thank
you,
your
honor.
