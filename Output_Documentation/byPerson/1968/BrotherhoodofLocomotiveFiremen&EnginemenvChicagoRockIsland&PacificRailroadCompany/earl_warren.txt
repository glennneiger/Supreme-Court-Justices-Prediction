mr.
youngdahl?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
light.
you
are
going
to
complete
the
argument
now,
very
well.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
light.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought
that
the
counsel
said
that
many
of
the
accidents
were
caused
by
collision,
an
increased
number
of
collisions
and
that
the
collisions
were
caused
by
the
lack
of
observation
because
there
were
fewer
men
in
the
cab.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
it
untrue,
the
fact
that
there
were
collision
accidents.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
but
you
just
made
the
statement
that
they
couldn't
show
anything
and
i
just
want
to
ask
you
if
it
was
a
fact
that
the
collision
accidents
had
risen?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
lucente.
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
casualities?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
about
the
accidents?
chief
justice
earl
warren
might
not
that
be
fortuitous,
just
the
fact
that
you
didn't
have
to
happen
to
have
any
very
large
accidents
that
killed
a
great
number
of
people
and
might
not
that
be
--
might
not
that
also
be
to
the
fact
the
railroads
have
taken
off
most
of
their
passenger
trains,
where
people
might
be
killed?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
suppose
you
would
agree
that
every
collision
carries
with
it,
the
possibility
of
the
casualty,
wouldn't
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it's
just
been
unlikely
nowadays.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
suppose
when
the
car
went
over
an
embankment,
it
might
be
of
casualty
so
far
as
some
of
the
employees
are
concerned,
wouldn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
wouldn't
it
be?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
wouldn't
there
be
employees
on
the
train
if
one
of
them
went
over
the
embankment?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
that
mean
they
wouldn't
be
hurt?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
don't
think
that
would
endanger
anybody
who
happen
to
be
in
the
caboose?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
to
the
embankment
in
order
to
have
a
casualty,
would
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
seems
to
me
we've
had
recent
cases
in
this
court
or
eight
cases,
i
believe,
where
someone
sitting
in
the
caboose
for
a
--
in
times
of
a
very
slight
accident
up
above
was
hurt
very
severely.
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
--
would
you
say
from
just
as
a
matter
of
common
sense
that
an
increase
made
number
of
collisions
was
not
a
safety
factor
but
it
could
be
seriously
considered
in
the
matter
of
this
kind?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
is
there
anything
in
the
reportability
of
accidents
that
would
effect
the
collision
part
of
your
argument,
as
to
whether
there
might
be
casualties
or
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
i
understood
counsel
to
say
that
in
arkansas
or
in
other
states,
there
was
a
much
greater
increase
in
collisions
during
a
given
period
recently
than
in
arkansas.
chief
justice
earl
warren
not
by
states
by
the
rest
of
the
country,
the
rest
of
the
country
was
considerably
higher
than
in
arkansas.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
true?
chief
justice
earl
warren
we
couldn't
assume,
could
we,
that
if
it
were
related
to
all
accidents,
some
of
them
didn't
relate
to
collisions?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
yard
service
not
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess.
chief
justice
earl

was
there
any
question
in

about
the

getting
