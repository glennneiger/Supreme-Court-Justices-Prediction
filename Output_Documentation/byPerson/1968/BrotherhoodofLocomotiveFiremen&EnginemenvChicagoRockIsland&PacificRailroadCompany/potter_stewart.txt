that
is
your
argument
with
respect
to
the
due
process
claim.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it's
not
for
the
arkansas
legislation
that
it's
determined,
how
much
to
--
in
its
unbridled
discretion,
how
much
to
burden
the
interstate
commerce,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
what
were
the
other
claims
that
you
have
to
meet?
justice
potter
stewart
and
discrimination
against
(voice

justice
potter
stewart
(voice

what
happened
to
the
equal
protection
clause
since
1916.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
what
is
this
--
what's
the
length
of
the
total
line
have
to
do
with
safety
as
in
individual
crossing?
justice
potter
stewart
this
--
these
exemptions
are
what
--
to
refresh
my
recollection,
50
miles
and
also
domestic
corporations,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
that
could
also
be
called
as
opposed
as
an
equal
protection
argument,
as
well.
justice
potter
stewart
did
the
new
york
--
did
the
recent
new
york
decision
deal
with
classifications
like
that?
did
the
new
york
law
have
a
comparable
classifications?
justice
potter
stewart
how
many
--
how
many
states
have
laws
like
this?
i
know
of
that
course
they're
not
identical.
i
gather
that
arkansas
perhaps
(voice

justice
potter
stewart
and
each
is
a
little
different,
i
suppose.
justice
potter
stewart
does
arkansas
have
a
crew
concess
law
relating
to
passenger
trains?
justice
potter
stewart
but
it's
apparently,
it's
not
an
issue
here?
justice
potter
stewart
maybe
you
don't
have
fast
trains
anymore.
justice
potter
stewart
they'd
hold
it
unconstitutional
under
what
operation
of
the
constitution?
justice
potter
stewart
or
was
it
the
state
constitution
they
were
talking
about?
justice
potter
stewart
that
could
of
course,
had
been
a
matter
of
state
constitutional
law?
justice
potter
stewart
has
there
been
a
discernable
trend,
one
way
or
the
other
legislatively,
either
toward
the
enactment
of
(voice

justice
potter
stewart
didn't
--
this
is
not
really
much
our
point,
but
haven't
i
read
that
new
york
is
talking
about
the
repealing
its
statute?
justice
potter
stewart
you
don't
make
any
claim
at
the
--
that
the
fewer
men
on
a
crew
makes
for
a
safer
operation.
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
don't
say,
you're
not
safer?
justice
potter
stewart
because
that
kind
of
a
claim
could
be
and
apparently
was
made
in
the
arizona
case.
the
claim
that
that
being
the
state
law
that's
limited
to
length
of
trains,
limited
to
numbers
of
freight
cars
in
a
train.
the
claim
being
that
if
there
were
shorter
trains,
there
would
be
more
trains
and
therefore,
more
great
crossing
accidents
and
so
on,
you
haven't
got
that
argument
available.
justice
potter
stewart
don't
you
--
couldn't
that
be
a
direct
reflection
of
the
fact
that
there
are
fewer
people
in
the
crew?
in
a
train
accident,
the
people
most
likely
to
be
hurt
are
the
crew
of
the
train,
if
there
are
only
four
in
there
instead
of
six,
that
would
account
for
fewer
(voice

justice
potter
stewart
would
you
say
there's
enough
evidence
--
would
you
say
that
we
should
--
if
we
--
i
suppose
you
would
object
just
to
our
even
doing
it
if
we
did
it
and
ruled
against
you.
justice
potter
stewart
i
mean
even
that
you
--
would
you
--
what
would
be
your
position
if
we
should
remand
this
case
or
not?
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
understand
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
what
business
do
you
suggest?
justice
