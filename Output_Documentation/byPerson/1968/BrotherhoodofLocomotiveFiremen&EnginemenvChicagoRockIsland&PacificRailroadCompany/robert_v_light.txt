mr.
robert
v.
light
mr.
chief
justice
warren,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
suppose
it
is
not
often
that
a
lawyer,
even
a
country
lawyer
comes
to
this
(inaudible)
chamber
and
conceived
(inaudible)
that
he
is
not
prepared
to
discuss
the
intricacies
of
the
record
or
the
law
in
a
particular
case.
however,
that
job
has
been
undertaken
by
the
counsel
for
brotherhoods
and
that
is
the
case
in
this
instance.
i
do
simply
want
to
emphasize
on
behalf
of
the
state
of
arkansas,
the
unequivocal
position
that
the
full-crew
acts,
which
are
presently
under
attached
by
the
railroads
are
a
legitimate
expression
by
the
people
of
the
state
of
arkansas,
both
through
their
elected
representatives
and
by
the
initiative
petition
process
which
is
granted
by
the
seventh
amendment
in
our
constitution.
and
that
the
people
all
convinced
that
these
full-crew
acts
are
necessary,
as
well
as
desirable,
both
for
the
safety
of
the
travelers
in
the
state
and
for
the
welfare
of
railroad
employees.
the
fact
that
attorneys
for
the
state
of
arkansas
have
not
been
deeply
involved
in
the
details
of
this
case,
should
not
be
construed
by
any
means
to
indicate
that
the
state
is
disinterested
in
the
outcome
thereof.
the
appellees
have
suggested
in
their
brief
that
the
state
has
made
a
minimum
presentation
and
that
that
minimum
presentation
indicates
some
absence
of
conviction
on
the
points.
this
is
emphatically
not
so,
the
state
of
arkansas
is
not
a
rich
state
financially.
we've
got
a
rock
of
fellow
there
temporarily,
but
there
are
many
demands
made
on
the
office
of
the
attorney
general
and
when
we
learned
that
the
brotherhoods
had
intended
to
make
a
thorough
and
complete
evidentiary
and
legal
presentation,
we
realized
that
our
limited
resources
could
best
be
applied
elsewhere.
mr.
robert
v.
light
i
understand
it,
five
your
honor,
i
believe
mr.
robert
v.
light
new
york
and
wisconsin,
indiana,
ohio,
arkansas.
mr.
robert
v.
light
yes
sir.
it's
my
understanding
that
they
are.
mr.
robert
v.
light
no
sir.
i
beg
your
pardon,
yes.
mr.
robert
v.
light
no,
it
is
not
an
issue.
mr.
robert
v.
light
we
have
very
few,
very
few.
they
have
not
only
discontinued
them,
they
have
taken
up
the
tracks
in
many
areas.
our
--
i'm
informed
by
counsel
for
the
brotherhoods
that
the
total
legal
tab
for
this
case
is
going
to
run
in
the
neighborhood
of
$100,000.00.
our
entire
litigation
budget
for
the
attorney
general's
office
is
$15,000.00
a
year.
in
1958,
it
was
pointed
out
in
the
briefs,
this
issue
was
presented
once
again
to
the
people
through
the
initiative
petition
process.
and
the
preamble
to
the
question
presented
to
the
people,
which
is
shown
on
page
12
in
our
brief,
is
essentially
the
same
as
the
in
treatise
which
are
now
made
by
the
railroad
to
this
court.
the
campaign
was
as
interesting
as
an
arkansas
political
campaign
can
be
with
handbills,
newspaper
ads,
radio
times,
etcetera.
and
the
results
were
decisive.
the
people
expressed
their
desire
130,465
for
appeal,
162,748
against
the
appeal,
and
that's
pretty
good
turnout
in
1958
for
the
state
of
arkansas.
this
court
has
recently
had
presented
to
it
another
case
from
our
state,
which
was
inherited
as
this
one
was.
i
only
want
to
emphasize
that
this
case
--
in
this
case
we're
as
dead
serious
as
we
can
be.
the
state
of
arkansas'
position
flatly
and
unequivocally
here.
mr.
robert
v.
light
no
sir,
just
in
case
that
the
same
newspapers
had
been
circulated
up
here
as
were
circulated
down
home.
i
wanted
the
court
to
know
that
we
are
serious
as
we
can
be
about
this
railroad
case.
mr.
robert
v.
light
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
my
presentation
i'll
touch
on
some
points
concerning
the
history
of
this
case
and
also
on
the
legal
standards
applied
by
the
court
below
in
reaching
the
unanimous
conclusions
that
are
contained
in
its
opinion
and
decree.
i'll
also
discuss
some
phases
of
the
proof
that
led
the
district
court
to
conclude
that
these
statutes
in
practical
operation
bear
no
reasonable
relationship
to
the
safety
of
railroad
operations
as
they
are
today
conducted
over
the
united
states
and
particularly
as
they
are
conducted
today
in
arkansas.
and
finally,
i'll
briefly
discuss
our
position
that
these
statutes
constitute
an
impermissible
discrimination
against
interstate
commerce
entirely
aside
from
the
undue
burden
against
commerce
argument
and
also
that
they
violate
the
equal
protection
clause.the
district
court
find
it
unnecessary
to
pass
on
either
of
these
constitutional
challenges
because
it
found
the
statues
to
be
clearly
unconstitutional
on
two
other
distinct
grounds.
my
colleague
mr.
lucente
will
expand
the
discussion
of
the
factual
basis
for
the
findings
of
the
court
below,
which
will
include
these
statistical
evidence
relating
to
the
safety
of
railroad
operations
as
it
bears
on
the
question
of
whether
the
minimum
crew
required
by
these
arkansas
statutes
of
six
men
on
both
freight
and
switch
crews
makes
any
contribution
to
railroad
safety.
he'll
discuss
the
findings
of
the
many
boards,
commissions
and
other
quasi-judicial
public
bodies
that
have
tried
and
decided
substantially
the
identical
fact
issues
that
are
presented
in
this
case.
and
finally,
he'll
describe
the
staggering
burden
of
these
statutes
to
the
appellee
railroads
in
terms
of
cost
of
compliance.
when
this
case
was
before
the
court
on
the
earlier
appeal
about
two
years
ago,
the
appellants
took
the
position
that
the
constitutional
challenges
were
so
insubstantial
as
to
make
the
case
an
inappropriate
one
for
three-judge
district
court.
this
court
rejected
that
argument
and
remanded
the
case
to
the
district
court
for
trial
and
determination
of
the
constitutional
issues,
which
of
course
have
had
not
undertaken
to
decide
in
draining
the
summary
judgment
that
it
had
earlier
entered.
as
we
understand
the
plain
language
of
this
court's
decision
on
the
earlier
appeal
it
simply
meant
that
the
complaint
filed
in
this
case
in
april
of
1964
sufficiently
alleged
facts
that
would
cause
these
statutes
to
be
unconstitutional
if
those
facts
were
proven
and
if
the
railroad
companies
could
prove
what
they'd
alleged
in
the
complaint,
they
were
entitled
to
the
relief
sought.
it
was
in
this
context
that
the
district
court
on
remand
scheduled
and
then
undertook
a
massive
trial
on
a
massive
record,
as
mr.
youngdahl
indicates,
over
a
hundred
witnesses
testified,
a
tremendous
volume
of
other
evidence
and
exhibits
were
received
by
the
court.
all
directed
toward
permitting
the
district
court
to
decide
the
central
factual
issue
of
whether
these
arkansas
statutes
in
practical
operation
today
really
have
any
rational
relationship
to
railroad
safety.
i
stressed
that
the
issues
addressed
to
the
district
court
were
almost
entirely
factual
and
not
legal
as
that
court
indicated
in
its
own
opinion,
the
opinion
from
which
this
appeal
is
prosecuted,
that
the
governing
legal
principles
are
clear
and
indeed
are
not
substantially
disputed.
and
the
court
then
based
on
the
massive
record
before
it
made
this
factual
finding.
we
find
from
the
overwhelming
weight
of
the
evidence
by
the
mid-1950s,
if
not
before,
the
firemen
on
a
diesel
locomotive
and
the
third
brakemen
or
helper
had
in
general
seized
to
perform
significant
safety
functions
in
the
operation
and
switching
of
freight
trains
and
cars.
those
findings
of
fact
on
this
record
supporting
those
findings
of
fact
led
inevitably
in
applying
the
constitutional
principles
that
have
been
established
by
this
court
to
the
lower
court's
central
holding
in
this
case,
which
was
at
under
present
conditions
continued
enforcement
of
the
statutes
makes
no
significant
contribution
to
railroad
safety.
and
that
statutes
as
they
operate
today
are
unreasonable
and
oppressive
and
violate
the
due
process
clause
and
unconstitutionally
burden
interstate
commerce.
i
should
note
that
the
district
court
of
three
judges
in
this
case
did
not
follow
the
example
of
the
norwood
case
and
refer
the
matter
to
a
special
master.
although
quite
obviously,
it
was
going
to
involve
a
very
extensive
accumulation
of
the
factual
record
but
the
three
judges
chose
to
hear
the
case
because
of
the
factual
context.
it's
necessary
for
them
to
pass
on
the
credibility
of
the
witnesses
and
of
course,
they
enjoyed
the
superior
position
of
being
able
to
do
that
of
hearing
the
witnesses
that
were
actually
presented
and
assessing
the
weight
that
was
to
be
given
to
their
conflicting
claims
or
conflicting
testimony.
the
validity
of
these
statutes
has
always
turned
on
a
fact
question.
the
norwood
case
in
1933
involved
the
same
sort
of
examination
of
the
facts
in
the
district
court
after
it
had
been
remanded
back
to
the
district
court.
the
accumulation
of
the
sort
of
record
that
we
have
here
today
only
on
1929,
1930,
and
1931
railroad
operating
facts,
and
then
the
appeal
from
the
conclusion
of
the
court
at
that
time,
the
district
court,
that
there
wasn't
sufficient
change
to
make
the
statutes
then
unreasonable,
there
wasn't
sufficient
improvement
in
railroad
technology
and
safety.
when
the
appeal
was
taken
from
that,
this
court
regarded
the
entire
matter
as
factual
and
in
per
curiam,
once
in
its
opinion,
it
said
we
see
no
reason
to
disagree
with
the
determinations
of
fact
of
the
district
court,
the
decree
is
affirmed.
we
submit
respectfully
that
that
would
be
an
entirely
appropriate
disposition
of
the
case
at
bar.
the
substance
very
briefly
of
the
proof
in
this
great
record,
and
to
make
it
perfectly
clear,
this
is
a
very
much
abbreviated
portion
of
the
record,
abbreviated
by
agreement
of
the
parties,
only
typical
extracts
of
the
testimony
and
typical
exhibits
have
put
in
here.
i
would
suspect
that
the
whole
record
if
printed
would
be
six
or
seven
times
the
volume
of
the
three
volumes
that
were
printed.
the
substance
of
that
proof
is
that
these
railroads
now
before
the
court,
these
six
railroads
and
all
the
other
american
railroads
are
operating
all
over
the
united
states
with
crews
of
less
than
the
minimum
of
six
required
by
the
two
arkansas
laws
and
that
they've
done
it
without
sacrifice
of
safety.
the
appellee
railroads
operations
outside
of
the
state
of
arkansas
are
down
with
crews
of
three
and
four
and
in
some
infrequent
situations,
five
with
no
sacrifice
of
safety.
approximately
40
operating
employees
of
these
railroad
companies
were
presented
by
the
intervenors
as
witnesses
in
this
case
to
testify
as
experts
on
railroad
operations.
and
each,
although
expressed
in
an
opinion
that
it
was
good
for
safety
to
have
the
six
men
described
by
the
arkansas
statutes
was
familiar
with
railroad
operations
conducted
with
a
lesser
crew.
many
of
the
them,
if
not
most,
had
participated
in
such
operations
on
crews
of
four
and
five,
and
sometimes
three,
either
in
other
states
where
the
appellees
operate
or
had
observed
such
operations
of
the
exempted
railroads
in
arkansas,
the
17
intrastate
railroads
that
don't
have
to
comply
with
these
statutes
and
consequently
have
crews
ranging
from
two
up
to
six.
and
none
of
these
employees
notwithstanding
that
opportunity
to
acquire
expertise
in
railroad
operations
and
to
note
about
what
cause
the
accidents.
none
of
them
could
cite
a
single
accident
that
they
could
attribute
to
the
absence
of
additional
men
on
those
crews
smaller
than
six.
mr.
youngdahl
referred
to
the
decision
a
couple
of
weeks
ago
of
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
robert
v.
light
that's
the
contention
of
the
other
side
your
honor.
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
facts
in
the
record
don't
vary
out.
mr.
robert
v.
light
as
i
indicated
mr.
chief
justice,
mr.
lucente
is
going
to
discuss
the
statistical
evidence
as
i
understand
the
statistical
evidence
--
mr.
robert
v.
light
as
i
understand
and
i'm
going
to,
if
the
court
permits,
make
an
abbreviated
answer
to
that
question
because
just
to
say
this
is
a
part
of
mr.
lucente's
presentation,
the
statistical
evidence
in
the
case
that
there
has
been
a
increase
in
the
number
of
reportable
collisions.
and
the
number
of
reportable
collision
is
one
that
produces
more
than
a
fix
dollar
amount
as
fixed
by
icc
regulation,
i
believe.
but
the
same
statistics
as
i
understand
it,
and
i
don't
offer
--
i
have
no
expertise
in
this,
show
that
that
type
of
accident
that
produces
injuries,
that's
what
we're
interested
here
in
safety
to
persons,
that
type
of
accident
that
produces
injuries
has
been
on
a
decline,
there
have
been
a
decrease
of
those.
in
the
decision
a
couple
of
weeks
ago,
the
new
york
central
against
lefkowitz
in
the
new
york
court
of
appeals,
the
court
was
divided
4
to
3.
there
was
a
vigorous
dissent
of
the
three
judges,
indicating
that
they
would
hold
the
statute,
the
single
statute
that
was
before
them
unconstitutional
as
make
work
legislation
and
not
a
safety
legislation,
but
the
majority
of
(voice
overlap).
mr.
robert
v.
light
i
take
it
under
the
due
process
clause.
mr.
robert
v.
light
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
don't
recall
whether
they
specified,
the
entire
court,
the
only
issue
upon
which
the
entire
seven
justices
of
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
were
agreed,
is
that
it
had
to
be
tested
as
safety
legislation,
and
if
it
didn't
pass
most
of
their,
it
failed
because
it
could
not
constitutionally
be
justified
as
an
economic
measure
or
a
measure
to
a
just
employment
relationships.
mr.
robert
v.
light
that's
possible
and
i
do
not
recall
whether
the
court
was
explicit
about
which
constitution.
but
the
majority,
four
in
that
case,
merely
held
with
on
the
evidence,
the
trial
courts
fact-finding
that
it
was
not
clearly
unreasonable
to
require
a
firemen
in
a
locomotive
under
a
certain
set
of
circumstances
was
supported
by
the
record,
it
was
a
permissible
fact-finding
for
him
to
make
on
this
massive
record.
and
the
majority
explicitly
distinguished
the
opinion
of
the
court
below
and
the
case
at
bar
and
said
that
was
tried
on
arkansas
facts
and
the
trial
court
made
different
fact-findings,
so
it's
entirely
a
factual
issue.
the
similarity
of
the
case
ends
with
the
fact
that
both
dealt,
both
this
case
and
that
of
new
york
case
dealt
with
state
regulation,
a
railroad
crew
concepts.
the
new
york
court
was
dealing
with
a
statutory
requirement
of
one
man
on
a
crew,
otherwise
composed
of
two,
three
or
four
additional
members,
fixed
by
the
size
of
that
crew
having
been
fixed
by
the
arbitrational
ward
282
or
collective
bargaining
subsequent
to
it.
the
arkansas
court
was
dealing
with
two
statutes
that
have
traditionally
been
the
most
burdensome
railroad
crew
concess
litigation
in
the
united
states
which
accounts
no
doubt
for
the
frequent
occasions,
for
judicial
appraisal
of
the
effect
and
validity
of
these
statutes.
the
six-man
requirement
in
the
arkansas
freight
crew
law
is
the
greatest
number
ever
required
by
any
state.
only
indiana,
also
requires
six
men
in
a
freight
crew
and
it
applies
it
to
longer
trainings.
the
six
men
requirement
in
the
arkansas
switch
crew
is
the
highest
requirement,
higher
than
any
other
requirement
ever
assessed
or
fixed
by
court
of
the
--
by
the
state
of
the
united
states
for
a
switch
crew.
no
other
state
has
ever
required
six
men
in
a
switch
crew.
i
might
say,
with
reference
to
the
four
other
states
mr.
--
and
if
this
information
is
correct
that
there
are
four
other
states
that
still
have
some
form
of
railroad
crew
concess
legislation.
none
of
it
is
nearly
as
burdensome
or
even
comparable
to
that
before
the
court
today.
mr.
robert
v.
light
there's
been
a
clear
trend,
which
is
acknowledged
by
my
adversaries
in
their
brief
toward
the
repeal
of
such
legislation.
at
one
time
there
was
some
20
states
with
some
form
of
the
legislation
or
the
other,
it's
down
to
five
now,
but
it's
a
hall
of
suggestion
to
tell
the
appellees
here
that
they
need
to
go
to
the
legislature
of
the
people
of
the
arkansas
to
be
relieved
of
this
staggering
burden
because
the
railroads
project
trip
by
1958,
as
our
colleagues
suggest
without
much
success.
mr.
robert
v.
light
justice
stewart,
the
new
york
had
three
crew
concess
statutes.
one
requiring
a
freight
crew,
as
i
recalled
six,
and
one
requiring
of
switch
crew
as
i
recall
five.
it
repealed
those
two
statutes
two
years
ago.
all
three
statutes
were
attacked
in
their
lawsuit
which
began
back
in
'63
or
'64
and
after
the
trial
court
had
entered
its
decisions,
sustaining
all
three,
the
legislature
repeal
those
two
leaving
only
the
statute
that
required
a
firemen
in
engine
crews
under
many
circumstances.
the
district
court
tested
the
constitutional
standards,
are
tested
against
the
constitutional
standards
established
by
this
court,
these
laws
under
both
the
due
process
and
commerce
clause
grounds.
it
correctly
apprehended
that
the
statute
would
be
valid
if
they
were
reasonably
related
to
the
safety
of
operations
and
if
there
were
unduly
oppressive
or
restrictive
or
costly
in
comparison
the
benefits
if
any
that
they
conferred.
and
the
court
acknowledged
that
if
the
reasonableness
of
the
statutes
remained
after
an
assessment
of
the
evidence
fairly
debatable,
the
statutes
would
be
sustained,
because
that
court
like
this
one
does
not
sit
to
pass
a
legislative
judgment.
but
it
found
that
conceding
as
late
as
norwood
that
the
statutes,
the
reasonableness
of
the
statutes
in
that
factual
context
35
years
ago
was
reasonably
debatable
that
it
does
not
continue
to
be
debatable
today
on
this
record
and
that
the
continued
debate
of
it
by
the
brotherhoods
does
not
make
it
so.
on
the
commerce
clause
test,
the
court
observed
that
since
the
statutes
had
a
distinct
impact
on
interstate
commerce,
it
was
required
to
make
the
judicial
appraisal
to
weigh
the
purported
local
benefits
to
be
derived
from
the
statutes
against
the
national
interest
in
an
unfettered
flow
of
interstate
commerce
free
from
local
restraint.
it
relied
on
this
court's
decision
in
the
southern
pacific
against
arizona
case,
where
the
court
found
on
the
factual
record
made
there
that
the
safety
benefits
from
the
arizona
train
link
laws
were
so
--
i'm
trying
to
think
of
the
phrase,
because
i
think
it's
significant,
so
slight
or
problematical
as
not
to
outweigh
the
national
interest
in
an
unfettered
commerce
and
the
train
link
law
was
declared
unconstitutional.
the
court
also
relied
on
morgan
against
virginia
decided
a
year
later
where
the
court
measuring
the
validity
of
a
statue
requiring
the
separation
of
passengers
on
interstate
conveyances
by
race
against
the
commerce
clause
only,
that
was
the
context
in
which
it
was
presented,
gave
great
stress
to
the
need
and
desirability
for
uniformity
of
regulation
of
interstate
commerce
and
found
that
uniformity
in
that
sort
of
regulation,
ordering
the
seating
of
passengers
on
interstate
conveyances
was
desirable
in
a
constitutional
sense
and
that
the
statutes
therefore
must
fall.
i
point
out
that
the
burden
here
on
interstate
commerce
of
the
full-crew
laws
is
far
greater
and
the
impact
far
greater
than
that
of
the
statute
in
morgan
against
virginia.
there,
the
passengers
could
move
in
accommodation
to
conflicting
state
regulations
as
the
conveyance
move
from
state
to
state
and
the
conveyance
didn't
have
to
be
stopped
and
presumably
no
cost
was
incurred
to
the
interstate
commerce
in
complying
with
that
statute.
here,
the
trains
must
stop
or
slow
to
comply
with
the
statutes.
here,
the
impact
of
the
cost
of
compliance
is
overwhelming.
the
court
concluded
and
we
submit
correctly
so
that
the
statutes
are
not
reasonably
related
to
safety
and
that
that's
not
fairly
debatable
in
light
of
present
day
railroad
operations
and
it
concluded
that
any
contribution
that
these
statutes
might
be
argued
to
make
to
safety
would
be
entirely
out
of
proportion
and
is
entirely
out
of
proportion
to
the
purported
benefits
they
concur.
it's
suggested
in
the
appellant's
brief
that
an
economic
justification
can
be
offered
as
alternative
to
support
the
validity
of
these
statutes.
the
case
made
below
with
the
factual
case
made
below
is
so
unwaived
that
the
appellants
feel
they
need
to
offer
an
alternative
at
this
stage
and
in
their
motion
to
intervene,
they've
setup
what
that
alternative
was,
what
their
interest
in
this
case.
they
said
their
interest
was
that
they
represented
the
employees
whose
jobs
were
protected
by
these
statutes
and
who
might
lose
their
jobs
if
the
statutes
were
repealed.
and
they
also
had
the
further
interest
that
if
they
had
a
diminution
of
membership
as
result
of
the
clarity
and
validity
of
these
statutes,
it
would
cost
them
a
loss
of
income,
it
cause
the
organization,
the
brotherhoods
a
loss
of
income.
the
district
court
rejected
that
argument
and
said
that
the
earlier
cases
including
the
decisions
of
this
court
had
authoritatively
characterized
each
statutes
as
safety
statutes
and
safety
statutes
alone.
the
supreme
court
and
then
it
accepted
that
characterization
and
indicated
that
the
statutes
might
well
be
violative
of
the
constitution
of
arkansas
if
it
was
attempted
to
measure
or
support
them
on
an
economic
justification
rather
than
safety.
the
supreme
court
of
arkansas
said
in
the
first
one
these
cases
coming
before
it
in
1908
that
this
legislation
can
only
be
supported
on
account
of
its
supposed
promotion
of
safety
of
the
public
and
the
employees.
this
court
in
its
1916
case,
referring
to
both
of
these
statutes,
the
1907
and
1913
statute
said
that
they
were
designed
for
the
purpose
of
ensuring
or
promoting
railroad
safety.
this
entire
case,
as
well
as
all
of
these
other
crew
concess
cases
litigated
over
the
years
have
been
and
has
been
litigated
on
the
issue
of
safety,
that's
what
the
proof
in
this
massive
record
went
to.
and
as
i've
earlier
noted,
the
seven
justices
of
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
were
unanimous
on
that
issue
alone
that
the
statute
had
the
standard
followed
based
on
its
contribution
to
safety.
of
all
the
evidence
in
the
record,
the
most
persuasive
and
most
dramatic
i
think
of
the
absurdities
of
these
statutes
and
of
the
real
impact
they
have
on
interstate
commerce
are
these
absurd
rituals
at
or
near
the
arkansas
state
line,
they
require
in
putting
on
and
taken
off
men
as
a
train
moves
from
another
state
into
arkansas
or
through
the
arkansas
unto
another
state.
there
are
many
examples
of
these
extra
employees
placed
on
the
train
for
the
sole
purpose
of
complying
on
the
arkansas
statute.
one
of
the
best
and
i'll
cite
only
one
in
interest
of
time
is
the
run
of
southern
pacific
railroad
company
from
the
coffeyville,
kansas
to
van
buren,
arkansas,
which
passes
through
on
most
of
these
run,
it's
ran
through
the
state
of
oklahoma.
from
coffeyville,
kansas
to
greenwood
junction,
arkansas,
the
train
is
operated
by
four-men
crew.
at
greenwood
junction,
the
train
is
stopped,
two
additional
employees
climbed
aboard
and
ride
the
train
for
the
balance
of
the
journey
in
van
buren,
arkansas
consisting
of
six
miles.
on
the
northward
trip,
exactly
the
same
thing
in
reverse
is
done,
a
six-man
crew
takes
the
train
out
of
arkansas
for
six
miles
to
greenwood
junction,
oklahoma,
where
two
men
get
off
the
train,
ride
a
taxi
back
to
town
and
four
men
take
the
train
through
oklahoma
to
kansas.
there
are
many
examples
in
the
record
of
this,
the
same
thing
as
illustrated
by
the
yards
of
these
railroads
where
the
state
line
bisects
the
yards.
the
south
pacific
yard
at
texarkana,
arkansas
is
bisected
by
the
texas
arkansas
line.
in
one
end
of
the
yard,
four
men
do
the
same
work
that
six
men
have
to
do,
when
one
of
the
switch
engines
ventures
into
the
arkansas
side
of
the
yards.
mr.
robert
v.
light
there's
no
doubt
about
it,
if
the
judgment
is
rationally
related
to
do
the
purported
purpose
of
its
regulation,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
v.
light
it
just
illustrates,
your
honor,
that
the
train
safely
moves
from
coffeyville
to
greenwood
junction
in
charge
of
four
men,
and
the
other
two
men
mounted
and
rendered
no
service
for
six
miles.
and
this
is
(voice
overlap).
mr.
robert
v.
light
yes
sir.
in
the
interest
of
time,
i
will
not
expand
on
the
discussion
in
the
brief
concerning
the
discrimination
against
commerce
contention
and
the
equal
protection
contention.
mr.
robert
v.
light
it
did
not
your
honor.
it
founded
unnecessary
and
specific
--
mr.
robert
v.
light
that's
right.
mr.
lucente
will
present
the
balance
of
the
argument.
mr.
robert
v.
light
mr.
chief
justice
warren,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
suppose
it
is
not
often
that
a
lawyer,
even
a
country
lawyer
comes
to
this
(inaudible)
chamber
and
conceived
(inaudible)
that
he
is
not
prepared
to
discuss
the
intricacies
of
the
record
or
the
law
in
a
particular
case.
however,
that
job
has
been
undertaken
by
the
counsel
for
brotherhoods
and
that
is
the
case
in
this
instance.
i
do
simply
want
to
emphasize
on
behalf
of
the
state
of
arkansas,
the
unequivocal
position
that
the
full-crew
acts,
which
are
presently
under
attached
by
the
railroads
are
a
legitimate
expression
by
the
people
of
the
state
of
arkansas,
both
through
their
elected
representatives
and
by
the
initiative
petition
process
which
is
granted
by
the
seventh
amendment
in
our
constitution.
and
that
the
people
all
convinced
that
these
full-crew
acts
are
necessary,
as
well
as
desirable,
both
for
the
safety
of
the
travelers
in
the
state
and
for
the
welfare
of
railroad
employees.
the
fact
that
attorneys
for
the
state
of
arkansas
have
not
been
deeply
involved
in
the
details
of
this
case,
should
not
be
construed
by
any
means
to
indicate
that
the
state
is
disinterested
in
the
outcome
thereof.
the
appellees
have
suggested
in
their
brief
that
the
state
has
made
a
minimum
presentation
and
that
that
minimum
presentation
indicates
some
absence
of
conviction
on
the
points.
this
is
emphatically
not
so,
the
state
of
arkansas
is
not
a
rich
state
financially.
we've
got
a
rock
of
fellow
there
temporarily,
but
there
are
many
demands
made
on
the
office
of
the
attorney
general
and
when
we
learned
that
the
brotherhoods
had
intended
to
make
a
thorough
and
complete
evidentiary
and
legal
presentation,
we
realized
that
our
limited
resources
could
best
be
applied
elsewhere.
mr.
robert
v.
light
i
understand
it,
five
your
honor,
i
believe
mr.
robert
v.
light
new
york
and
wisconsin,
indiana,
ohio,
arkansas.
mr.
robert
v.
light
yes
sir.
it's
my
understanding
that
they
are.
mr.
robert
v.
light
no
sir.
i
beg
your
pardon,
yes.
mr.
robert
v.
light
no,
it
is
not
an
issue.
mr.
robert
v.
light
we
have
very
few,
very
few.
they
have
not
only
discontinued
them,
they
have
taken
up
the
tracks
in
many
areas.
our
--
i'm
informed
by
counsel
for
the
brotherhoods
that
the
total
legal
tab
for
this
case
is
going
to
run
in
the
neighborhood
of
$100,000.00.
our
entire
litigation
budget
for
the
attorney
general's
office
is
$15,000.00
a
year.
in
1958,
it
was
pointed
out
in
the
briefs,
this
issue
was
presented
once
again
to
the
people
through
the
initiative
petition
process.
and
the
preamble
to
the
question
presented
to
the
people,
which
is
shown
on
page
12
in
our
brief,
is
essentially
the
same
as
the
in
treatise
which
are
now
made
by
the
railroad
to
this
court.
the
campaign
was
as
interesting
as
an
arkansas
political
campaign
can
be
with
handbills,
newspaper
ads,
radio
times,
etcetera.
and
the
results
were
decisive.
the
people
expressed
their
desire
130,465
for
appeal,
162,748
against
the
appeal,
and
that's
pretty
good
turnout
in
1958
for
the
state
of
arkansas.
this
court
has
recently
had
presented
to
it
another
case
from
our
state,
which
was
inherited
as
this
one
was.
i
only
want
to
emphasize
that
this
case
--
in
this
case
we're
as
dead
serious
as
we
can
be.
the
state
of
arkansas'
position
flatly
and
unequivocally
here.
mr.
robert
v.
light
no
sir,
just
in
case
that
the
same
newspapers
had
been
circulated
up
here
as
were
circulated
down
home.
i
wanted
the
court
to
know
that
we
are
serious
as
we
can
be
about
this
railroad
case.
mr.
robert
v.
light
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
my
presentation
i'll
touch
on
some
points
concerning
the
history
of
this
case
and
also
on
the
legal
standards
applied
by
the
court
below
in
reaching
the
unanimous
conclusions
that
are
contained
in
its
opinion
and
decree.
i'll
also
discuss
some
phases
of
the
proof
that
led
the
district
court
to
conclude
that
these
statutes
in
practical
operation
bear
no
reasonable
relationship
to
the
safety
of
railroad
operations
as
they
are
today
conducted
over
the
united
states
and
particularly
as
they
are
conducted
today
in
arkansas.
and
finally,
i'll
briefly
discuss
our
position
that
these
statutes
constitute
an
impermissible
discrimination
against
interstate
commerce
entirely
aside
from
the
undue
burden
against
commerce
argument
and
also
that
they
violate
the
equal
protection
clause.the
district
court
find
it
unnecessary
to
pass
on
either
of
these
constitutional
challenges
because
it
found
the
statues
to
be
clearly
unconstitutional
on
two
other
distinct
grounds.
my
colleague
mr.
lucente
will
expand
the
discussion
of
the
factual
basis
for
the
findings
of
the
court
below,
which
will
include
these
statistical
evidence
relating
to
the
safety
of
railroad
operations
as
it
bears
on
the
question
of
whether
the
minimum
crew
required
by
these
arkansas
statutes
of
six
men
on
both
freight
and
switch
crews
makes
any
contribution
to
railroad
safety.
he'll
discuss
the
findings
of
the
many
boards,
commissions
and
other
quasi-judicial
public
bodies
that
have
tried
and
decided
substantially
the
identical
fact
issues
that
are
presented
in
this
case.
and
finally,
he'll
describe
the
staggering
burden
of
these
statutes
to
the
appellee
railroads
in
terms
of
cost
of
compliance.
when
this
case
was
before
the
court
on
the
earlier
appeal
about
two
years
ago,
the
appellants
took
the
position
that
the
constitutional
challenges
were
so
insubstantial
as
to
make
the
case
an
inappropriate
one
for
three-judge
district
court.
this
court
rejected
that
argument
and
remanded
the
case
to
the
district
court
for
trial
and
determination
of
the
constitutional
issues,
which
of
course
have
had
not
undertaken
to
decide
in
draining
the
summary
judgment
that
it
had
earlier
entered.
as
we
understand
the
plain
language
of
this
court's
decision
on
the
earlier
appeal
it
simply
meant
that
the
complaint
filed
in
this
case
in
april
of
1964
sufficiently
alleged
facts
that
would
cause
these
statutes
to
be
unconstitutional
if
those
facts
were
proven
and
if
the
railroad
companies
could
prove
what
they'd
alleged
in
the
complaint,
they
were
entitled
to
the
relief
sought.
it
was
in
this
context
that
the
district
court
on
remand
scheduled
and
then
undertook
a
massive
trial
on
a
massive
record,
as
mr.
youngdahl
indicates,
over
a
hundred
witnesses
testified,
a
tremendous
volume
of
other
evidence
and
exhibits
were
received
by
the
court.
all
directed
toward
permitting
the
district
court
to
decide
the
central
factual
issue
of
whether
these
arkansas
statutes
in
practical
operation
today
really
have
any
rational
relationship
to
railroad
safety.
i
stressed
that
the
issues
addressed
to
the
district
court
were
almost
entirely
factual
and
not
legal
as
that
court
indicated
in
its
own
opinion,
the
opinion
from
which
this
appeal
is
prosecuted,
that
the
governing
legal
principles
are
clear
and
indeed
are
not
substantially
disputed.
and
the
court
then
based
on
the
massive
record
before
it
made
this
factual
finding.
we
find
from
the
overwhelming
weight
of
the
evidence
by
the
mid-1950s,
if
not
before,
the
firemen
on
a
diesel
locomotive
and
the
third
brakemen
or
helper
had
in
general
seized
to
perform
significant
safety
functions
in
the
operation
and
switching
of
freight
trains
and
cars.
those
findings
of
fact
on
this
record
supporting
those
findings
of
fact
led
inevitably
in
applying
the
constitutional
principles
that
have
been
established
by
this
court
to
the
lower
court's
central
holding
in
this
case,
which
was
at
under
present
conditions
continued
enforcement
of
the
statutes
makes
no
significant
contribution
to
railroad
safety.
and
that
statutes
as
they
operate
today
are
unreasonable
and
oppressive
and
violate
the
due
process
clause
and
unconstitutionally
burden
interstate
commerce.
i
should
note
that
the
district
court
of
three
judges
in
this
case
did
not
follow
the
example
of
the
norwood
case
and
refer
the
matter
to
a
special
master.
although
quite
obviously,
it
was
going
to
involve
a
very
extensive
accumulation
of
the
factual
record
but
the
three
judges
chose
to
hear
the
case
because
of
the
factual
context.
it's
necessary
for
them
to
pass
on
the
credibility
of
the
witnesses
and
of
course,
they
enjoyed
the
superior
position
of
being
able
to
do
that
of
hearing
the
witnesses
that
were
actually
presented
and
assessing
the
weight
that
was
to
be
given
to
their
conflicting
claims
or
conflicting
testimony.
the
validity
of
these
statutes
has
always
turned
on
a
fact
question.
the
norwood
case
in
1933
involved
the
same
sort
of
examination
of
the
facts
in
the
district
court
after
it
had
been
remanded
back
to
the
district
court.
the
accumulation
of
the
sort
of
record
that
we
have
here
today
only
on
1929,
1930,
and
1931
railroad
operating
facts,
and
then
the
appeal
from
the
conclusion
of
the
court
at
that
time,
the
district
court,
that
there
wasn't
sufficient
change
to
make
the
statutes
then
unreasonable,
there
wasn't
sufficient
improvement
in
railroad
technology
and
safety.
when
the
appeal
was
taken
from
that,
this
court
regarded
the
entire
matter
as
factual
and
in
per
curiam,
once
in
its
opinion,
it
said
we
see
no
reason
to
disagree
with
the
determinations
of
fact
of
the
district
court,
the
decree
is
affirmed.
we
submit
respectfully
that
that
would
be
an
entirely
appropriate
disposition
of
the
case
at
bar.
the
substance
very
briefly
of
the
proof
in
this
great
record,
and
to
make
it
perfectly
clear,
this
is
a
very
much
abbreviated
portion
of
the
record,
abbreviated
by
agreement
of
the
parties,
only
typical
extracts
of
the
testimony
and
typical
exhibits
have
put
in
here.
i
would
suspect
that
the
whole
record
if
printed
would
be
six
or
seven
times
the
volume
of
the
three
volumes
that
were
printed.
the
substance
of
that
proof
is
that
these
railroads
now
before
the
court,
these
six
railroads
and
all
the
other
american
railroads
are
operating
all
over
the
united
states
with
crews
of
less
than
the
minimum
of
six
required
by
the
two
arkansas
laws
and
that
they've
done
it
without
sacrifice
of
safety.
the
appellee
railroads
operations
outside
of
the
state
of
arkansas
are
down
with
crews
of
three
and
four
and
in
some
infrequent
situations,
five
with
no
sacrifice
of
safety.
approximately
40
operating
employees
of
these
railroad
companies
were
presented
by
the
intervenors
as
witnesses
in
this
case
to
testify
as
experts
on
railroad
operations.
and
each,
although
expressed
in
an
opinion
that
it
was
good
for
safety
to
have
the
six
men
described
by
the
arkansas
statutes
was
familiar
with
railroad
operations
conducted
with
a
lesser
crew.
many
of
the
them,
if
not
most,
had
participated
in
such
operations
on
crews
of
four
and
five,
and
sometimes
three,
either
in
other
states
where
the
appellees
operate
or
had
observed
such
operations
of
the
exempted
railroads
in
arkansas,
the
17
intrastate
railroads
that
don't
have
to
comply
with
these
statutes
and
consequently
have
crews
ranging
from
two
up
to
six.
and
none
of
these
employees
notwithstanding
that
opportunity
to
acquire
expertise
in
railroad
operations
and
to
note
about
what
cause
the
accidents.
none
of
them
could
cite
a
single
accident
that
they
could
attribute
to
the
absence
of
additional
men
on
those
crews
smaller
than
six.
mr.
youngdahl
referred
to
the
decision
a
couple
of
weeks
ago
of
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
robert
v.
light
that's
the
contention
of
the
other
side
your
honor.
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
facts
in
the
record
don't
vary
out.
mr.
robert
v.
light
as
i
indicated
mr.
chief
justice,
mr.
lucente
is
going
to
discuss
the
statistical
evidence
as
i
understand
the
statistical
evidence
--
mr.
robert
v.
light
as
i
understand
and
i'm
going
to,
if
the
court
permits,
make
an
abbreviated
answer
to
that
question
because
just
to
say
this
is
a
part
of
mr.
lucente's
presentation,
the
statistical
evidence
in
the
case
that
there
has
been
a
increase
in
the
number
of
reportable
collisions.
and
the
number
of
reportable
collision
is
one
that
produces
more
than
a
fix
dollar
amount
as
fixed
by
icc
regulation,
i
believe.
but
the
same
statistics
as
i
understand
it,
and
i
don't
offer
--
i
have
no
expertise
in
this,
show
that
that
type
of
accident
that
produces
injuries,
that's
what
we're
interested
here
in
safety
to
persons,
that
type
of
accident
that
produces
injuries
has
been
on
a
decline,
there
have
been
a
decrease
of
those.
in
the
decision
a
couple
of
weeks
ago,
the
new
york
central
against
lefkowitz
in
the
new
york
court
of
appeals,
the
court
was
divided
4
to
3.
there
was
a
vigorous
dissent
of
the
three
judges,
indicating
that
they
would
hold
the
statute,
the
single
statute
that
was
before
them
unconstitutional
as
make
work
legislation
and
not
a
safety
legislation,
but
the
majority
of
(voice
overlap).
mr.
robert
v.
light
i
take
it
under
the
due
process
clause.
mr.
robert
v.
light
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
don't
recall
whether
they
specified,
the
entire
court,
the
only
issue
upon
which
the
entire
seven
justices
of
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
were
agreed,
is
that
it
had
to
be
tested
as
safety
legislation,
and
if
it
didn't
pass
most
of
their,
it
failed
because
it
could
not
constitutionally
be
justified
as
an
economic
measure
or
a
measure
to
a
just
employment
relationships.
mr.
robert
v.
light
that's
possible
and
i
do
not
recall
whether
the
court
was
explicit
about
which
constitution.
but
the
majority,
four
in
that
case,
merely
held
with
on
the
evidence,
the
trial
courts
fact-finding
that
it
was
not
clearly
unreasonable
to
require
a
firemen
in
a
locomotive
under
a
certain
set
of
circumstances
was
supported
by
the
record,
it
was
a
permissible
fact-finding
for
him
to
make
on
this
massive
record.
and
the
majority
explicitly
distinguished
the
opinion
of
the
court
below
and
the
case
at
bar
and
said
that
was
tried
on
arkansas
facts
and
the
trial
court
made
different
fact-findings,
so
it's
entirely
a
factual
issue.
the
similarity
of
the
case
ends
with
the
fact
that
both
dealt,
both
this
case
and
that
of
new
york
case
dealt
with
state
regulation,
a
railroad
crew
concepts.
the
new
york
court
was
dealing
with
a
statutory
requirement
of
one
man
on
a
crew,
otherwise
composed
of
two,
three
or
four
additional
members,
fixed
by
the
size
of
that
crew
having
been
fixed
by
the
arbitrational
ward
282
or
collective
bargaining
subsequent
to
it.
the
arkansas
court
was
dealing
with
two
statutes
that
have
traditionally
been
the
most
burdensome
railroad
crew
concess
litigation
in
the
united
states
which
accounts
no
doubt
for
the
frequent
occasions,
for
judicial
appraisal
of
the
effect
and
validity
of
these
statutes.
the
six-man
requirement
in
the
arkansas
freight
crew
law
is
the
greatest
number
ever
required
by
any
state.
only
indiana,
also
requires
six
men
in
a
freight
crew
and
it
applies
it
to
longer
trainings.
the
six
men
requirement
in
the
arkansas
switch
crew
is
the
highest
requirement,
higher
than
any
other
requirement
ever
assessed
or
fixed
by
court
of
the
--
by
the
state
of
the
united
states
for
a
switch
crew.
no
other
state
has
ever
required
six
men
in
a
switch
crew.
i
might
say,
with
reference
to
the
four
other
states
mr.
--
and
if
this
information
is
correct
that
there
are
four
other
states
that
still
have
some
form
of
railroad
crew
concess
legislation.
none
of
it
is
nearly
as
burdensome
or
even
comparable
to
that
before
the
court
today.
mr.
robert
v.
light
there's
been
a
clear
trend,
which
is
acknowledged
by
my
adversaries
in
their
brief
toward
the
repeal
of
such
legislation.
at
one
time
there
was
some
20
states
with
some
form
of
the
legislation
or
the
other,
it's
down
to
five
now,
but
it's
a
hall
of
suggestion
to
tell
the
appellees
here
that
they
need
to
go
to
the
legislature
of
the
people
of
the
arkansas
to
be
relieved
of
this
staggering
burden
because
the
railroads
project
trip
by
1958,
as
our
colleagues
suggest
without
much
success.
mr.
robert
v.
light
justice
stewart,
the
new
york
had
three
crew
concess
statutes.
one
requiring
a
freight
crew,
as
i
recalled
six,
and
one
requiring
of
switch
crew
as
i
recall
five.
it
repealed
those
two
statutes
two
years
ago.
all
three
statutes
were
attacked
in
their
lawsuit
which
began
back
in
'63
or
'64
and
after
the
trial
court
had
entered
its
decisions,
sustaining
all
three,
the
legislature
repeal
those
two
leaving
only
the
statute
that
required
a
firemen
in
engine
crews
under
many
circumstances.
the
district
court
tested
the
constitutional
standards,
are
tested
against
the
constitutional
standards
established
by
this
court,
these
laws
under
both
the
due
process
and
commerce
clause
grounds.
it
correctly
apprehended
that
the
statute
would
be
valid
if
they
were
reasonably
related
to
the
safety
of
operations
and
if
there
were
unduly
oppressive
or
restrictive
or
costly
in
comparison
the
benefits
if
any
that
they
conferred.
and
the
court
acknowledged
that
if
the
reasonableness
of
the
statutes
remained
after
an
assessment
of
the
evidence
fairly
debatable,
the
statutes
would
be
sustained,
because
that
court
like
this
one
does
not
sit
to
pass
a
legislative
judgment.
but
it
found
that
conceding
as
late
as
norwood
that
the
statutes,
the
reasonableness
of
the
statutes
in
that
factual
context
35
years
ago
was
reasonably
debatable
that
it
does
not
continue
to
be
debatable
today
on
this
record
and
that
the
continued
debate
of
it
by
the
brotherhoods
does
not
make
it
so.
on
the
commerce
clause
test,
the
court
observed
that
since
the
statutes
had
a
distinct
impact
on
interstate
commerce,
it
was
required
to
make
the
judicial
appraisal
to
weigh
the
purported
local
benefits
to
be
derived
from
the
statutes
against
the
national
interest
in
an
unfettered
flow
of
interstate
commerce
free
from
local
restraint.
it
relied
on
this
court's
decision
in
the
southern
pacific
against
arizona
case,
where
the
court
found
on
the
factual
record
made
there
that
the
safety
benefits
from
the
arizona
train
link
laws
were
so
--
i'm
trying
to
think
of
the
phrase,
because
i
think
it's
significant,
so
slight
or
problematical
as
not
to
outweigh
the
national
interest
in
an
unfettered
commerce
and
the
train
link
law
was
declared
unconstitutional.
the
court
also
relied
on
morgan
against
virginia
decided
a
year
later
where
the
court
measuring
the
validity
of
a
statue
requiring
the
separation
of
passengers
on
interstate
conveyances
by
race
against
the
commerce
clause
only,
that
was
the
context
in
which
it
was
presented,
gave
great
stress
to
the
need
and
desirability
for
uniformity
of
regulation
of
interstate
commerce
and
found
that
uniformity
in
that
sort
of
regulation,
ordering
the
seating
of
passengers
on
interstate
conveyances
was
desirable
in
a
constitutional
sense
and
that
the
statutes
therefore
must
fall.
i
point
out
that
the
burden
here
on
interstate
commerce
of
the
full-crew
laws
is
far
greater
and
the
impact
far
greater
than
that
of
the
statute
in
morgan
against
virginia.
there,
the
passengers
could
move
in
accommodation
to
conflicting
state
regulations
as
the
conveyance
move
from
state
to
state
and
the
conveyance
didn't
have
to
be
stopped
and
presumably
no
cost
was
incurred
to
the
interstate
commerce
in
complying
with
that
statute.
here,
the
trains
must
stop
or
slow
to
comply
with
the
statutes.
here,
the
impact
of
the
cost
of
compliance
is
overwhelming.
the
court
concluded
and
we
submit
correctly
so
that
the
statutes
are
not
reasonably
related
to
safety
and
that
that's
not
fairly
debatable
in
light
of
present
day
railroad
operations
and
it
concluded
that
any
contribution
that
these
statutes
might
be
argued
to
make
to
safety
would
be
entirely
out
of
proportion
and
is
entirely
out
of
proportion
to
the
purported
benefits
they
concur.
it's
suggested
in
the
appellant's
brief
that
an
economic
justification
can
be
offered
as
alternative
to
support
the
validity
of
these
statutes.
the
case
made
below
with
the
factual
case
made
below
is
so
unwaived
that
the
appellants
feel
they
need
to
offer
an
alternative
at
this
stage
and
in
their
motion
to
intervene,
they've
setup
what
that
alternative
was,
what
their
interest
in
this
case.
they
said
their
interest
was
that
they
represented
the
employees
whose
jobs
were
protected
by
these
statutes
and
who
might
lose
their
jobs
if
the
statutes
were
repealed.
and
they
also
had
the
further
interest
that
if
they
had
a
diminution
of
membership
as
result
of
the
clarity
and
validity
of
these
statutes,
it
would
cost
them
a
loss
of
income,
it
cause
the
organization,
the
brotherhoods
a
loss
of
income.
the
district
court
rejected
that
argument
and
said
that
the
earlier
cases
including
the
decisions
of
this
court
had
authoritatively
characterized
each
statutes
as
safety
statutes
and
safety
statutes
alone.
the
supreme
court
and
then
it
accepted
that
characterization
and
indicated
that
the
statutes
might
well
be
violative
of
the
constitution
of
arkansas
if
it
was
attempted
to
measure
or
support
them
on
an
economic
justification
rather
than
safety.
the
supreme
court
of
arkansas
said
in
the
first
one
these
cases
coming
before
it
in
1908
that
this
legislation
can
only
be
supported
on
account
of
its
supposed
promotion
of
safety
of
the
public
and
the
employees.
this
court
in
its
1916
case,
referring
to
both
of
these
statutes,
the
1907
and
1913
statute
said
that
they
were
designed
for
the
purpose
of
ensuring
or
promoting
railroad
safety.
this
entire
case,
as
well
as
all
of
these
other
crew
concess
cases
litigated
over
the
years
have
been
and
has
been
litigated
on
the
issue
of
safety,
that's
what
the
proof
in
this
massive
record
went
to.
and
as
i've
earlier
noted,
the
seven
justices
of
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
were
unanimous
on
that
issue
alone
that
the
statute
had
the
standard
followed
based
on
its
contribution
to
safety.
of
all
the
evidence
in
the
record,
the
most
persuasive
and
most
dramatic
i
think
of
the
absurdities
of
these
statutes
and
of
the
real
impact
they
have
on
interstate
commerce
are
these
absurd
rituals
at
or
near
the
arkansas
state
line,
they
require
in
putting
on
and
taken
off
men
as
a
train
moves
from
another
state
into
arkansas
or
through
the
arkansas
unto
another
state.
there
are
many
examples
of
these
extra
employees
placed
on
the
train
for
the
sole
purpose
of
complying
on
the
arkansas
statute.
one
of
the
best
and
i'll
cite
only
one
in
interest
of
time
is
the
run
of
southern
pacific
railroad
company
from
the
coffeyville,
kansas
to
van
buren,
arkansas,
which
passes
through
on
most
of
these
run,
it's
ran
through
the
state
of
oklahoma.
from
coffeyville,
kansas
to
greenwood
junction,
arkansas,
the
train
is
operated
by
four-men
crew.
at
greenwood
junction,
the
train
is
stopped,
two
additional
employees
climbed
aboard
and
ride
the
train
for
the
balance
of
the
journey
in
van
buren,
arkansas
consisting
of
six
miles.
on
the
northward
trip,
exactly
the
same
thing
in
reverse
is
done,
a
six-man
crew
takes
the
train
out
of
arkansas
for
six
miles
to
greenwood
junction,
oklahoma,
where
two
men
get
off
the
train,
ride
a
taxi
back
to
town
and
four
men
take
the
train
through
oklahoma
to
kansas.
there
are
many
examples
in
the
record
of
this,
the
same
thing
as
illustrated
by
the
yards
of
these
railroads
where
the
state
line
bisects
the
yards.
the
south
pacific
yard
at
texarkana,
arkansas
is
bisected
by
the
texas
arkansas
line.
in
one
end
of
the
yard,
four
men
do
the
same
work
that
six
men
have
to
do,
when
one
of
the
switch
engines
ventures
into
the
arkansas
side
of
the
yards.
mr.
robert
v.
light
there's
no
doubt
about
it,
if
the
judgment
is
rationally
related
to
do
the
purported
purpose
of
its
regulation,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
v.
light
it
just
illustrates,
your
honor,
that
the
train
safely
moves
from
coffeyville
to
greenwood
junction
in
charge
of
four
men,
and
the
other
two
men
mounted
and
rendered
no
service
for
six
miles.
and
this
is
(voice
overlap).
mr.
robert
v.
light
yes
sir.
in
the
interest
of
time,
i
will
not
expand
on
the
discussion
in
the
brief
concerning
the
discrimination
against
commerce
contention
and
the
equal
protection
contention.
mr.
robert
v.
light
it
did
not
your
honor.
it
founded
unnecessary
and
specific
--
mr.
robert
v.
light
that's
right.
mr.
lucente
will
present
the
balance
of
the
argument.
