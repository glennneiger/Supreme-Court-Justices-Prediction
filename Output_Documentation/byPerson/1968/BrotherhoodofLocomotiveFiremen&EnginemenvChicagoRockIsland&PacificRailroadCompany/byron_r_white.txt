justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
there's
any
different
in
this
respect
between
the
freight
crew
law
in
the
switching
crew
law?
are
they
--
is
that
--
is
there's
a
switching
crew
law
involved?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
how
about
the
--
does
this
pass
the
same
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
there
is
a
factual
argument
with
in
terms
of
discrimination
against
interstate
commerce.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
why
isn't
there
is
discrimination
against
interstate
commerce
and
the
switching
crew
law?
but
the
switching
crew
law
applies
to
all
100-mile
railroad,
does
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
yet
you
say
it's
a
local
operation.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then,
why
wouldn't
it
apply
to
local
trains
then?
i
mean
if
shortline
intrastate
railroad,
you
just
said
they
are
--
justice
byron
r.
white
they
do,
don't
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
100-mile
in
some
other
--
but
the
local
railroads,
the
intrastate
railroads,
less
than
50-mile
railroads
don't
have
to
comply
with
the
switching
crew,
do
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
don't
they?
if
the
--
if
the
switching
is
really
a
local
operation,
what
difference
does
it
make,
whether
you
own
a
100
miles
of
track
or
only
50?
well,
i
suggest
that
the
longer
trains
come
in,
the
bigger
the
companies
come
in
to
that
switching
area,
with
longer
trains,
they
switch
more
cars,
they
have
more
complicated
movements
to
attend
to,
they're
less
able
to
take
care
of
a
cost
of
compliance,
which
is
involved.
with
the
facts
as
which
occurred
to
me
offhand,
i
think
that
i
see
no
reason
to
disagree
with
this
court's
1916
decision
in
respect
to
what
seems
to
me
to
be
an
identical
arguments.
primarily,
we
feel,
that
there
are
all
kinds
of
basis
for
factual
and
opinion
clashes
and
many
aspects
of
this
case,
and
the
record
is
of
voluminous
and
facts
can
be
found
to
support
a
judgment
of
any
reasonable
man
or
any
reasonable
legislature.
and
under
the
rules
of
this
court
about
judicial
intervention,
we
respectfully
urge
that
the
decision
of
the
court
below
reversed1
--
reversed
and
the
complaint
dismissed.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
one
state
can
a
make
different
judgment
as
to
what
risks
it's
willing
to
put
up
with,
couldn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
i
suppose
the
yard
--
i
suppose
the
same
rituals
can
that
take
place
if
it
still
upholds
the
arkansas
law.
i
mean
it
doesn't
make
the
arkansas
law
bad
just
because
(voice
overlap).
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
that
so.
justice
byron
r.
white
can
i
just
ask
you
if
the
court
below
make
findings
on
discrimination?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
didn't
reach
that
issue?
justice
byron
r.
white
may
i
ask
you
this
one
question,
what
if
the
court
didn't
reach
to
(inaudible),
have
you
lost
the
case
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
about
the
(inaudible),
do
you
still
ask
that
the
--
if
we
disagree
with
your
path,
do
we
then
have
to
base
the
discrimination
purpose?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
will
make
it
discriminatory.
justice
byron
r.
white
lower
court
did
not
have
such
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
think
that
the
--
do
you
think
that
the
very
factors
which
would
show
that
these
laws
are
related
to
safety
would
also
show
that
there's
a
difference
between
50-mile
trains
and
longer
trains?
justice
byron
r.
white
roads
not
trains.
justice
byron
r.
white
unless
your
opponents
are
right
in
saying
that
the
longer
roads
have
longer
trains.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
the
freight?
that
just
go
for
the
switching
statute
though.
justice
byron
r.
white
this
is
the
same
kind
of
an
argument
that
goes
to
whether
or
not
these
laws
are
related
to
safety
at
all
or
not.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so,
if
the
laws
are
not
related
--
are
related
to
safety,
you
would
also
lose
your
discrimination
argument,
at
least
in
the
freight
area?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
in
the
freight
area?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
it
has
(inaudible)
on
the
road?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what's
the
matter
of
trying
it
again
or
weren't
these
issues
involve
--
weren't
the
issues
made
up
--
the
issues
which
were
made
up
in
the
trial
court
included
discrimination
and
equal
protection?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
the
case
was
tried
with
those
issues
in
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
record
was
made
close.
justice
byron
r.
white
which
is
the
question
of
findings?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
maybe
--
some
cases
that
may
have
said
that
in
equal
protection
area,
but
you
think
they've
said
that
in
the
commerce
area?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
the
discrimination
against
interest
commerce?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
there's
any
different
in
this
respect
between
the
freight
crew
law
in
the
switching
crew
law?
are
they
--
is
that
--
is
there's
a
switching
crew
law
involved?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
how
about
the
--
does
this
pass
the
same
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
there
is
a
factual
argument
with
in
terms
of
discrimination
against
interstate
commerce.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
why
isn't
there
is
discrimination
against
interstate
commerce
and
the
switching
crew
law?
but
the
switching
crew
law
applies
to
all
100-mile
railroad,
does
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
yet
you
say
it's
a
local
operation.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then,
why
wouldn't
it
apply
to
local
trains
then?
i
mean
if
shortline
intrastate
railroad,
you
just
said
they
are
--
justice
byron
r.
white
they
do,
don't
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
100-mile
in
some
other
--
but
the
local
railroads,
the
intrastate
railroads,
less
than
50-mile
railroads
don't
have
to
comply
with
the
switching
crew,
do
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
don't
they?
if
the
--
if
the
switching
is
really
a
local
operation,
what
difference
does
it
make,
whether
you
own
a
100
miles
of
track
or
only
50?
well,
i
suggest
that
the
longer
trains
come
in,
the
bigger
the
companies
come
in
to
that
switching
area,
with
longer
trains,
they
switch
more

they
have
more

to

that

can

make

it

do
we

have

will

you

would

show

there's

not

white
unless
your

are
right
in
saying
that
the

have
longer

justice
byron

white
what
about
the
freight?
that
just
go
for
the

though.
justice

this
is
the

that
goes
to
whether

and
so,
if

are

you
would
also
lose
your

argument,
at

in

justice

even

well,
what's

that

some

in

you

they've
said
that
in

or
the
discrimination
against
