mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
was
an
action
by
six
large
railroad
companies
in
a
three-judge
federal
court
in
arkansas
against
officials
of
the
state
of
arkansas
charged
with
enforcing
two
statutes.
the
first
applies
to
companies
with
it
at
least
50
miles
of
railroad
track,
when
those
companies
are
operating
freight
train
with
25
cars
or
more,
required
the
crew
of
an
engineer
of
firemen,
a
conductor,
and
three
brakemen.
the
second
statute
applies
to
railroad
companies
with
at
least
a
100
miles
of
track,
when
operating
a
switch
train
over
public
crossings
in
urban
communities.
it
requires
a
crew
of
an
engineer,
a
fireman,
a
foreman
and
three
helpers.
i
represent
four
railroad
brotherhoods
which
were
permitted
to
intervene
in
the
lower
courts,
speaking
for
the
employees
affected
by
these
statutes
of
full
crew
laws
in
question,
and
our
defendant
interveners,
the
defendant
appellants
in
this
case.
at
this
stage
of
a
case,
it's
the
second
time
this
case
has
been
here,
at
this
stage
of
a
case,
there
are
four
constitutional
issues.
the
court
below
found
that
the
statutes
violated
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
constitute
an
impermissible
burden
of
interstate
commerce.
the
railroads
also
urge
in
this
appeal
that
there
are
classification
infirmaries
in
the
law
in
violation
of
the
equal
protection
clause
and
indiscrimination
against
interstate
commerce.
the
normal
statement
of
the
case
would
not
apply
in
our
view
to
this
controversy
because
it
has
been
50
or
60
years
long,
when
the
opinion
of
the
court
has
written
in
this
case,
it
will
be
the
eleventh
entry
in
the
united
states'
reports
on
exactly
the
same
arkansas
statutes.
there's
been
extensive
substantive
discussion
of
the
same
constitutional
issues
involving
the
same
statutes
in
five
previous
opinions
of
this
court,
all
of
which
upheld
the
legislation
challenge.
but
evidently,
the
railroad
resources
are
inexhaustible,
and
we
are
back
again
arguing
substantially
the
same
issues
in
1968.
the
first
case
on
the
particular
statute
was
in
1911,
where
the
freight
crew
statute
was
upheld
against
three
constitutional
contentions.
the
railroads
there
argued
that
with
automatic
couplers
and
air
brakes,
a
third
brakeman
was
unnecessary
and
required
an
expenditure
of
a
needless
amount
of
money.
generally,
the
court
found
and
held
that
those
questions
even
then
were
concluded
by
former
decisions
involving
railroads
and
involving
similar
constitutional
issues.
as
to
the
commerce
clause,
we
found
no
violation
until
act
of
congress
displaces
the
legislation;
as
to
equal
protection,
several
previous
decisions
involving
mileage
classifications
were
noted;
and
as
to
due
process,
the
court
found
some
room
for
controversy,
but
found
the
statute
were
to
remain
to
the
object
for
this
legislature
had
in
view.
so,
even
if
deemed
unwise,
where
the
court
would
not
be
overruled
by
the
court.
the
1916
case
in
this
court
involved
the
switch
crew
statute.
more
summarily,
the
railroads
again,
this
court
again
upheld
the
statute
in
question.
this
time
there
were
again
commerce
clause,
equal
protection,
and
due
process
argument.
the
only
new
facts
that
the
railroad
brought
up
with
respect
to
that
statute
in
1916
was
that
the
switch
crew
statute
does
not
apply
to
train
of
a
25
car
length.
and
that
the
exemption
results
in
the
fact
that
the
covered
railroad
switch
over
the
same
crossing
as
non-covered
railroads,
therefore,
having
classification
infirmities.
the
court
know
that's
impossible
for
legislation
to
be
all
comprehensive,
that
the
grouping
was
reasonable
and
the
statute
should
be
upheld.
the
next
attempt
resulted
in
the
norwood
decision
of
this
court
in
1931.
this
time
there
were
four
constitutional
arguments:
due
process,
equal
protection,
commerce
clause,
and
the
supremacy
clause,
arguing
at
the
railway
labor
act
of
interstate
commerce,
comission
regulation
that
preempted
the
laws.
the
railroad
made
some
new
factual
contentions,
saying
if
there
was
improvement
in
road
and
equipment,
that
some
collective
bargaining
agreements
permitted
a
smaller
crew,
and
that
other
states
had
smaller
crews
and
operator
law
rights.
this
court
found
there
was
no
preemption
by
the
railway
labor
act.
the
other
constitutional
issues
were
in
substance
resolved.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
if
bad
faith
of
a
litigation,
dismissed
the
complaint
with
an
extensive
discussion
about
cost
of
compliance,
pointing
out
if
the
railroad
have
completely
failed
to
show
that
relative
cost
of
compliance
had
increased.
that
case
was
in
trial
on
the
merits
before
a
three-judge
court
in
the
west
district
of
arkansas
in
1933.
the
court
after
a
long
trial
and
extensive
consideration
issued
a
long
and
comprehensive
decision
going
down
fact
by
fact
of
arkansas
railroading
but
the
three-judge
court
at
that
point
thought
that
the
issues
were
limited
by
this
court
to
a
due
process
challenge
of
change
of
conditions
and
increased
relative
cost
of
compliance.
both
of
those
arguments
so
restricted
were
rejected
by
the
west
district
of
arkansas
which
upheld
the
statues,
this
court
affirmed
in
a
memorandum
opinion
of
the
same
year.
the
next
discussion
by
this
court
of
the
same
statute
in
question
was
in
the
landmark
southern
pacific
against
arizona
case
in
1945,
where
while
a
train
length
statute
of
arizona
was
invalidated
by
this
court,
this
court
in
our
view
took
great
pains
to
distinguish
the
full-crew
law
decisions
to
point
out
for
example
that
those
laws
do
require
such
impediments
of
interstate
commerce,
which
are
stopping
a
state
lines
to
pick
up
crew
members.
but
that
those
impediments
were
not
of
a
kind,
it
made
them
constitutionally
invalid,
and
pointed
out
that
there
in
lay
the
distinction
with
the
southern
pacific
against
arizona
burden
on
commerce
kind
of
rule.
the
next
consideration
by
this
court
of
the
arkansas
full-crew
law
was
in
1966,
in
this
same
case.
and
i
suggest
that
the
off
coast
to
the
court
on
the
preemption
issue,
which
was
the
primary
question
at
that
time,
the
lower
court
had
ruled
against
this
on
preemption,
and
we
appeal
and
this
court
reversed.
and
in
considering
a
preemption
question,
the
opinion
of
mr.
justice
black
noted
particularly
that
in
view
of
norwood
and
the
previous
cases,
that
even
the
preemption
issue
was
presented
narrowly,
that
it
has
specific
things
happens
since
1933,
to
change
the
1933
decision
about
preemption.
the
court
found
in
the
'61
decision,
it
had
not.
the
law
was
upheld,
the
discrimination
against
the
interstate
commerce
argumentally
with
the
railroads
in
1966
was
also
rejected
on
the
record
before
the
court
at
that
time.
further,
all
recent
reported
decision
on
the
same
issues
by
course
of
other
jurisdictions,
outside
of
a
decision
we're
appealing
from
here
today,
have
upheld
the
constitutionality
of
similar
laws.
the
indiana
supreme
court
refused
even
to
take
evidence
on
change
of
conditions,
saying
it's
a
matter
for
the
legislature.
the
ohio
open
courts
rejected
all
the
identical
constitutional
contentions.
the
new
york
courts
were
extremely
persuasive
opinions,
analyzed
at
great
length
that
new
york
full-crew
statute
is
very
similar
to
those
of
arkansas
at
time
of
the
trial,
rejected
the
railroad
arguments,
upheld
the
statutes.
it
was
affirmed
by
the
appellate
division,
and
about
two
weeks
ago,
it
was
affirmed
4
to
3
by
the
new
york
court
of
appeals.
the
record
here
is
massive
and
it
is
extremely
difficult
to
brief
or
argue
the
detailed
facts
of
dozens
and
dozens
of
witnesses
who
gave
opinions
and
reasons
for
their
opinions.
pages
and
pages,
and
exhibits
and
huge
exchanges
of
information
about
railroading.
i
question
whether
would
be
advisable
in
any
event
to
reiterate
the
intensive
discussions
about
the
duties
of
firemen,
duties
of
brakemen
and
switchmen.
that
discussion
has
been
engaged
in
so
many
times
by
so
many
tribunals
and
have
been
substantially
the
same
that
there's
argument
on
both
sides,
that
there
is
room
for
judgment
by
reasonable
men
on
both
ways.
the
judgment
in
this
instance
of
the
state
of
arkansas
on
its
legislative
process
was
that
it
is
important
to
the
safety
of
the
state
to
have
these
statutes.
as
to
the
duty
of
the
fireman,
the
most
notable
kind
of
situation
is
that
firemen,
in
the
sense
of
a
man
shoveling
coal
into
a
great
have
long
time
seized.
the
firemen
in
the
sense
of
maintaining
the
mode
of
power,
providing
inspection
and
lookout
in
relief
and
emergency
duties
have
under
sophisticated
modern
conditions
of
railroading
have
and
continued
to
exercise
is
extremely
important
functions.
as
to
brakemen,
the
outstanding
conclusion
from
the
extensive
record
in
this
case
is
a
brakemen
do
substantially
now
what
they
get
in
1933.
they
do
a
substantially,
then
the
court
said
what
they
did
in
1916
and
1911,
the
previous
analysis
of
this
statute
by
this
court.
as
to
equipment
and
facilities,
the
evidence
is
that
certainly
there
have
been
some
improvements
in
railroad
conditions,
railroad
equipment
or
railroad
facilities.
certainly
as
well,
there
have
been
some
factors
which
have
made
railroading
more
dangerous
than
railroading
was
in
1933
and
1960,
and
1911,
and
1945.
there
are
faster
and
longer,
and
heavier
trains,
which
are
deteriorating,
and
deteriorate
the
equipment
and
the
crossings
over
which
they
pass.
there
is
this
factor
combined
with
items
like
heavier
highway
traffic,
the
school
bus
program,
for
example
in
arkansas,
the
record
shows,
was
unknown
at
the
time
of
the
norwood
case.
now,
it's
a
large
program
involving
the
transportation
of
hundreds
or
thousand
of
children
over
the
crossing
of
these
trains
passed.
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
yes
your
honor,
that's
the
most
important
aspect
of
our
argument.
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
that
is
also
our
argument
with
respect
to
the
burden
on
commerce.
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
that
is
certainly
true,
your
honor.
my
response
to
that
would
be
this,
that
the
first
evaluation
is
by
the
arkansas
legislature.
the
second
evaluation
is
judicial
if
it
has
not
had
held
from
congress.
in
this
instance,
there
is
a
legislative
evaluation
of
a
kind
of
thing
which
this
court
did
in
southern
pacific
against
arizona
for
example.
the
intensive/extensive
evidence
was
taken
on
the
importance
of
crews
to
safety
before
congress.
and
the
last
decision
of
this
court
analyze
some
of
that
legislative
history.
congress
decided
expressly,
at
least
in
expressed
legislative
history,
not
to
preempt,
still
this
court
found.
the
reason
for
that
decision,
we
would
submit
is
a
determination
on
the
merit
if
there's
some
ground
for
states
making
these
decisions.
i
would
suggest
that
that
would
be
of
considerable
impact
of
the
evaluation
of
this
court,
even
under
the
burden
on
commerce
argument.
we
contend
that
there
are
--
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
equal
protection
and
--
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
yes
your
honor.
perhaps
i
might
refer
briefly
to
them
right
now
because
i
had
not
intended
to
later
on.
both
of
them
say
that
they
are
classifications,
which
are
somehow
rigid.
perhaps
the
cases
aren't
firm.
our
first
argument
as
to
those
is
that
those
questions
have
been
resolved
before.
the
primary
basis
for
the
exemption
argument,
the
50
and
100-miliage
of
track
made
by
the
railroads
is
that
exempt
company
switch
over
the
same
crossings
is
non-exempt
companies.
this
exact
point
was
discussed
and
was
a
major
element
of
discussion.
in
the
1916
arkansas
full-crew
case
in
this
court,
st.
louis
iron
mountain,
southern
railway
against
arkansas,
fighting
that
while
--
maybe
the
classification
wasn't
perfect.
there
seem
to
be
a
considerable
differences
between
50-mile
and
a
100-mile
railroads
and
large
railroads.
there
was
a
fact
--
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
well,
that
is
true
your
honor,
but
a
good
deal
has
not
happened
in
our
view
to
arkansas
railroading
with
respect
to
that
kind
of
fact.
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
well,
we
can
think
of
several
things,
the
record
shows
the
following
kind
of
fact.
the
smaller
companies
have
lower
speeds,
whereas
the
companies
that
are
appellees
in
this
case
go
75
miles
an
hour.
the
only
evidence
in
the
record
on
the
exempted
company
shows
speed
limits
of
35
miles
an
hour
for
the
company
i
happen
to
recall.
the
evidence
shows
that
the
railroads
represented
as
the
appellees
in
this
case
have
trains
of
a
150
cars
long.
whereas
the
trains
represented
by
the
exempted
companies,
the
record
shows,
have
consistently
shorter
trains.
for
example,
it
is
customarily
the
movement
of
one
or
two,
or
five,
or
seven
cars
of
this
court
in
southern
pacific
against
arizona,
recognizing
--
recognized
the
increase
danger
involved
in
longer
trains.
the
50-mile
railroad
company
exemption
has
been
repeatedly
upheld
by
this
court.
and
in
1950,
in
morey
against
doud,
this
court
observed
that
there
was
particularly,
that
that
50-mile
railroad
exemption
was
a
kind
of
classification,
which
was
sustainable
as
contrasted
with
the
classification
which
was
involved
in
that
particular
case.
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
no
your
honor,
something
of
a
sort,
purely
50
miles
and
100
miles.
now,
after
the
interstate
as
against
intrastate
discrimination
argument,
there
is
not
a
perfect
correlation
--
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
either
way
it's
in
classification
is
infirmed
in
some
way.
now,
as
to
those
arguments,
the
record
in
a
number
of
respects
shows
important
distinctions.
furthermore,
the
interstate/intrastate
dichotomy
does
not
fit
the
exemption
dichotomy.
in
other
words,
there
are
interstate
railroad
not
covered
by
the
statute
because
they
do
not
have
50
or
100
miles
of
line
and
vice
versa.
and
so
it
is
not
a
perfect
as
the
railroads
would
probably
suggest,
but
the
facts
of
the
record
show
that
it's
not.
again,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
class
of
that
particular
railroad
classification
principle
by
mileage
of
track
has
been
upheld
for
a
hundred
years
in
respect
to
regulatory
statutes
and
safety
statute
by
this
court.
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
yes
your
honor
and
the
long
opinion
in
the
case
of
the
opinion
of
supreme
court,
the
trial
court,
which
is
a
very
careful
discussion
of
that
to
deal
in
detail
with
it,
i
do
not
recall
whether
or
not
the
court
of
appeals
refer
to
that
particular
thing
or
not.
one
further
aspect
to
the
50
to
100-mile
classification,
which
would
support
the
classification
that
such
in
our
view,
the
railroads
have
make
a
great
argument
of
the
fact
that
the
cost
of
compliance
is
high.
i
would
like
to
say
something
about
that
in
a
moment,
but
if
the
cost
of
compliance
is
a
factor
and
clearly
it
could
be,
the
smaller
railroad
companies
as
i
suppose
are
less
able
to
assume
the
cost
of
compliance
with
these
statutes
and
that
might
legitimately
be
a
factor
in
a
classification,
not
one
which
we
would
rely
on
wholly
but
certainly
a
factor.
outside
of
the
multitude
of
evidence
on
the
duties
of
employees
and
the
equipment
and
facilities
of
the
railroads,
the
most
persuasive
part
of
a
record
altogether
in
our
view
is
a
mass
of
statistical
material.
this
is
the
first
time
in
arkansas
full-crew
law
cases
of
a
many
that
have
been
in
this
court
and
the
first
time
in
any
full-crew
law
case
and
other
jurisdiction
that
i
know
of,
where
we
now
have
experienced
to
look
at,
because
in
april
1964,
with
the
effect
of
the
1963
legislation
of
congress,
railroads
did
in
fact
reduced
their
operating
crew
substantially.
most
firemen
were
taken
off
at
a
very
rapid
rate
and
a
good
many
in
a
slower
rate,
brakemen
and
switchmen
were
taken
off.
as
a
result
of
that,
we
have
now
a
period
of
time
to
look
at
and
i
submit
that
the
statistics
from
this
period
are
most
persuasive
about
the
connection
between
these
statutes
and
safety.
and
at
the
very
least,
establish
the
right
of
the
arkansas
legislature
and
the
arkansas
people,
because
it's
also
been
voted
on
populatory
in
arkansas
to
make
the
cause
and
effect
determination,
resulting
from
those
statistics.
clearly
from
this
evidence
that
railroading
is
a
very
hazardous
business
and
continues
to
be,
clearly
number
two,
that
beginning
in
april
1964
many
crewmen
have
been
take
off
of
trains
nationally,
large
percentage
dropped.
three,
clearly
since
april
1964
or
may,
railroad
accidents
have
increased
substantially.
and
number
four,
that
when
you
analyze
those
accidents
and
you
find
those
that
are
most
attributable
to
crew
side
and
crew
performance,
those
accidents
have
increased,
especially
and
the
rate
of
those
accidents
have
increased
especially.
now,
a
causal
--
a
cause
and
effect
decision
we
say
as
primarily
legislative,
but
there
are
some
things
to
assist
in
that
kind
of
evaluation
here.
for
example,
collisions,
it
is
conceded
by
all
the
parties
that
collisions
are
that
type
of
accidents,
most
attributable
to
crew
performance.
accidents
went
up
--
have
gone
up
for
a
period
of
time,
but
beginning
exactly
at
the
time
when
many
most
firemen
were
taken
off
of
freight
trains
in
this
country,
collisions
sky
rocketed.
the
rate
of
increase
changed
entirely
as
to
collisions.
for
example
further,
causes
of
accidents,
causes
such
as
disregard
of
stop
signals,
failure
to
secure
handbrakes,
running
through
switches,
failure
of
the
engineer
to
keep
a
look
out,
that
kind
of
thing,
most
attributable
to
employee
performance.
the
rate
of
such
accidents,
accidents
from
such
causes
also
rose
sharply
beginning
in
april
or
may
1964,
extremely
important
causal
factor.
now,
the
railroads
are
hardpressed
to
answer
this
kind
of
testimony.
they
answer
it
partly
by
using
improper
statistical
techniques.
for
example,
let's
say
casualties
have
not
gone
up,
because
they
measure
casualties
by
billion
grossed
ton-miles.
a
kind
of
exposure
factor
which
no
one
else
uses
and
even
the
railroads
and
other
context,
the
record
shows
do
not
use.
they
compare
one
year
with
another
one
year,
instead
of
comparing
periods
of
time.
the
claimant
there
had
been
reporting
defects
and
that
the
amount
of
train
accident,
dollar
damage,
in
order
to
justify
a
report
has
stayed
constant
for
the
last
several
years.
but
the
fact
that
the
department
of
transportation
of
the
united
states
government
has
found
a
startling
and
alarming
rise
and
it
repeatedly
has
told
congress
that
we
need
assistance
in
the
railroad
accidents
field,
which
in
the
last
few
years
had
become
more
and
more
serious
to
the
point
of
real
dangerous
calamity.
they
say
that
the
accident
rate
was
increasing
all
along,
but
again
it's
possible
to
isolate
that
kind
of
accident,
which
is
most
attributable
to
crew
performance,
and
furthermore
the
rate
of
the
increase
that
the
department
of
transportation
notes,
the
rate
of
increase
has
gone
up
higher
in
the
years,
since
1964
than
it
have
been
going
up
since
that
time.
but
even
under
the
railroad
statistics,
comparing
1962
and
1966,
the
railroads
with
more
firemen
had
a
smaller
increase
in
the
collision
rate.
over
the
largest
reported
in
a
full-crew
states
had
better
accident
and
casualty
rate
experience
than
non
full-crew
states.
arkansas
train
accidents
have
been
increasing
at
a
slower
rate
than
state
with
smaller
operating
crews.
during
the
period
with
the
same
traffic
density,
casualty
rates
are
no
less
for
diesel
and
for
steam
locomotives,
and
comparing
pre-1964
and
post-1964
experience,
arkansas
now
have
a
smaller
percentage
of
the
national
casualties,
during
the
time
where
those
crew
sides
had
been
proportionately
larger.
one
aspect
of
a
railroad's
case
which
we
contend
they
have
totally
failed
to
prove,
is
the
aspect
of
cost
of
compliance.
both
in
commerce
clause,
the
burden
on
commerce
cases
and
in
due
process
cases,
the
cost
of
compliance
had
been
a
major
consideration
by
this
court.
the
standards
for
the
full-crew
cases
have
been
laid
out
expressly
and
in
detail
by
this
court,
in
the
1931
norwood
decision.
this
court
pointed
out
that
it's
not
enough
to
say
why
we
have
to
spend
so
much
money
last
year,
but
there
has
to
be
a
relative
cost
factor
presented
to
the
court.
it
has
to
relate
to
the
operation
of
those
employees
per
ton,
per
car,
per
mile,
per
something,
and
to
say
that
we
spent
$5.00
more
this
year
than
we
spent
in
last,
has
no
due
process
relevance.
the
railroads
have
this
in
front
of
them
and
yet,
they
totally
failed
to
acknowledge
in
this
case.
they
simply
put
an
evidence
saying
we
spent
$7
million
in
arkansas
in
1966
or
1965
in
complying
with
the
statute.
and
on
cross
examination,
they
said,
“well,
we
added
up
all
the
wages
of
the
firemen
and
all
the
wages
of
the
third
brakemen
or
switchmen
and
that's
$7
million.”
now,
that
alone
is
not
enough,
but
we
have
more
in
this
record,
which
reveal
the
deficiency
as
to
this
aspect
of
the
case.
we
have
accidentally
the
operating
papers
used
by
one
of
appellee
railroads,
kansas
city
southern,
in
making
their
cost
of
compliance
calculations,
in
which
the
actual
mileage
expense
in
arkansas
for
train
crewmen,
people
in
the
back
part
of
the
train,
and
for
engine
crewmen,
the
firemen
and
the
engineer
is
presented.
and
the
startling
result,
totally
uncontradictory
in
this
record,
the
startling
result
from
these
figures
is
that
kansas
city
southern
did
not
experience
any
increase,
in
cost
of
compliance
per
mile
of
arkansas
railroading
after
the
change
in
national
crews
in
the
other
states
in
which
operates
and
up-to-date
or
up
to
the
period
covered
in
the
evidence.
in
other
words,
railroads
have
failed
generally
as
to
this
point.
when
we
look
farther
towards
the
kind
of
formulas
which
norwood
command,
we
find
there's
some
evidence
and
that
evidence
show
that
there's
no
cost
of
compliance
at
all.
i
found
as
startling
when
i
first
heard
it
and
we
began
to
inquire
and
there's
evidence
about
what
some
of
the
causes
might
be.
certainly,
the
railroads
have
ignored
for
example
the
fact
that
in
places
where
engineers
ride
without
a
fireman
or
firemen
are
not
required,
the
have
to
pay
an
extra
allowance
to
the
engineers,
ignored
completely
by
the
railroad.
certainly,
everyone
can
see
in
the
record,
and
the
railroads
make
a
big
point
of
this
in
their
briefs,
that
with
a
smaller
crew,
it
takes
a
longer
time
to
operate
a
train,
with
a
longer
time,
it
kicks
in
certain
constructive
and
progressive
allowances,
which
the
people
who
are
on
the
crew
have
to
be
paid.
certainly,
there
is
substantial
evidence
in
which
the
court,
i'm
certain
that
legislative
could
conclude
that
the
accident
rate
goes
up
startlingly
with
a
smaller
crew,
and
that
this
perhaps
account
for.
but
in
any
event,
the
only
evidence
showing
related
cost
of
compliance,
not
related
to
one
year
to
other
as
a
railroads
argue,
but
related
as
to
the
kind
of
performance
of
these
crew
members
shows
that
there
is
virtually
no
cost
of
compliance
at
all.
this
is
in
our
view
a
perfect
case
for
the
application
of
the
principle
that
this
court
does
not
fit
as
a
super
legislature,
and
a
perfect
illustration
of
why
that
is
so
is
the
opinion
of
a
court
below,
because
the
opinion
of
the
court
below
is
no
more
or
less
in
our
view
than
a
report
of
a
committee,
a
legislative
committee
saying
why
they
would
like
to
change
the
law.
it
does
not
as
was
the
norwood
case,
it
does
not
as
was
the
new
york
case
a
careful
fact
by
fact,
detail
by
detail
analysis
of
what
firemen
do
and
what
brakemen
do,
and
what
locomotives
do,
and
what
the
crossing
hazards
are
and
all
those
things.
it
is
rather
a
general
discussion
of
why
the
judges
think
that
the
full-crew
library
economically
unwise,
why
are
they
unhappy
with
them.
they
say
for
example
that
we
suspect
their
primary
paragraph
on
the
evidence
in
the
case.
it
says
the
record
is
voluminous
and
massive,
and
there
are
films
and
pictures
and
testimony
of
dozens
and
dozens
of
witnesses,
and
depositions
and
so
on,
and
said,
“we
are
not
going
to
make
any
attempt
to
discuss
this."
probably,
we
suspect
that
much
of
it
is
surplusage.
how
can
a
court
suspect
that
massive
record
is
surplusage,
if
it
has
made
a
factual
analysis?
an
an
analysis
which
would
properly
underlie
a
conclusion
that
there
is
no
conceivable
germane
connection
between
a
legitimate
state
purpose,
the
safety
of
its
public
and
it's
railroad
men
and
the
statue
in
question.
the
court
below
notes
that
the
legislation
hamstrings
labor
relations
and
worries
about
the
effect
on
the
railroad
in
competition
with
a
coming
barge
traffic
in
the
arkansas
river.
these
are
classically
legislative
determinations
and
certainly
not
a
basis
for
constitutional
invalidations
such
with
that
of
a
court
below
--
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
yes
your
honor.
there
are
two
statutes,
one
freight
was
generally
for
over
the
road
service
and
one
switching
for
a
switching
in
yards.
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
as
far
as
--
as
far
as
any
legal
standard,
i
don't
see
a
difference
at
all.
there
are
some
factual
differences,
a
substantial
one.
for
example,
the
railroads
argue
that
when
a
train
is
on
the
road,
that
they
can
put
an
extra
brakemen
in
the
cab,
thereby
making
firemen
unnecessary.
this
is
not
true
in
a
yard,
where
all
the
brakemen
have
to
be
passing
signals
and
things
to
that
kind
and
the
firemen
himself
has
to
be
passing
signals
to
their
factual
differences
in
the
functions
of
the
people
involved.
but
in
so
far
as
the
legal
arguments,
your
honor,
i
see
no
difference
whatsoever.
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
well,
there
is
the
--
that
difference
and
that
that
applies
only
to
the
freight
crew
law,
i
presume
or
the
burden
on
commerce
argument
would
apply
only
to
the
freight
crew
law,
because
the
switching
crews
are
not
an
interstate
kind
of
situation.
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
that's
correct.
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
well,
that's
correct,
but
--
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
well,
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record.
or
the
evidence
in
the
record
consists
of
this
kind
of
thing,
the
railroad
say
that
at
x
location,
in
x
tower
in
arkansas,
100-mile
companies
and
less
than
100-mile
companies
switch
across
the
same
crossing
with
different
size
crew
as
a
result
of
the
statute.
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
that
is
correct.
that
is,
however,
a
limited
condition.
the
intercity
large
companies
and
their
distinction
in
the
statute
is
not
interstate/intrastate
and
the
classification
does
not
--
is
not
contiguous.
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
that
is
correct.
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
with
reference
to
mr.
justice
white's
last
point
in
the
general
issue
about
the
justification
of
a
100-mile
classification
in
switch
crews
--
switch
yard,
to
be
overly
candid
perhaps,
i
shutter
at
the
fact
of
going
back
to
try
those
case,
again
we've
(voice
overlap).
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
certainly
that
is
correct.
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
certainly,
that
is
correct.
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
yes.
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
well,
i
understand
your
honor
that
the
compelling
principle
in
a
constitutional
challenge
is
that
the
plaintiffs
had
a
burden
of
showing
that
the
laws
is
unconstitutional.
now,
there
are
cases
that
the
court
is
well
familiar
with,
which
state
that
if
any
state
of
facts
known
a
reasonably
can
be
conceived
that
would
support
the
classification
if
that's
sufficient.
now,
there's
a
good
deal
of
evidence
in
here
that
the
covered
companies
--
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
well,
i
don't
understand
commerce
to
be
involved
in
a
particular
--
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
well,
your
honor,
as
to
discriminate
against
interstate
commerce,
our
primary
answer
would
be
that
the
two
groups
are
not
all
contiguous
well-formed
interstate
covered,
intrastate
not
covered,
to
the
contrary
without
going
into
detail
at
this
time.
as
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
there's
justification
for
100-mile
classification
in
yard
operations,
the
evidence
shows
that
companies
operate
longer
trains
that
are
covered,
that
are
not
covered,
and
that
longer
cost
of
cars
are
operated
in
contrary
that
as
mr.
lucente
said
that
are
covered,
that
are
not
covered.
the
evidence
shows
that
the
companies
that
are
covered
carry
more
volatile
materials
for
example.
materials
that
tend
to
have
more
opportunity
to
blow
up
and
blow
up
a
whole
town
and
company
that
are
not
covered.
furthermore,
we
would
rely
heavily
on
the
many
years
of
decisions
by
this
court
about
mileage
classifications
and
particularly
the
1916
decision
in
this
case,
in
which
equal
protection
involve
and
all
classification
arguments
involved
only
the
arkansas
switching
crew
as
distinguished
from
the
road
freight
statute.
in
reference
to
the
question
about
one
of
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
rule
on
this
point,
if
i
may
quote
just
a
sentence
or
two
from
the
decision
of
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
about
two
weeks
ago,
“plaintiffs
do
not
establish
on
the
record,
that
the
statute
deny
them
equal
protection
of
the
laws.
differences
in
the
impact
of
statutes
depend
for
validity
and
the
rationality,
the
difference,
citing
morey
against
doud,
and
some
differences
applying
to
specifically
the
railroad
have
been
sustained
by
this
court,
citing
new
york
central
against
williams,
which
was
one
of
the
case
that
we
rely
on
in
the
previous
arkansas
full-crew
case.”
it
goes
on
to
discuss
that
further
at
length.
i'm
sure
the
court
rule
for
me
where
i
result
with.
as
to
--
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
we
would
be
glad
to
make
them
available
your
honor,
it
was
just
issues
about
two
weeks
ago.
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
i
will,
yes
your
honor,
thank
you.
as
to
the
question
about
whether
or
not
there's
a
passenger
crew
statute,
i
want
to
emphasize
that
there
is
a
full-crew
law
statute
in
arkansas
applying
to
passenger
trains.
the
railroads
have
on
some
past
instances
challenge
that
statute,
they
do
not
hear,
for
reasons
which
i
suggest
to
have
some
value
in
this
court's
consideration
now.
as
to
the
questions
of
collision
--
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
i
don't
understand
--
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
i
don't
understand
why,
if
they
contend
that
it's
just
as
safe
not
to
have
a
fireman,
and
not
just
a
safe
on
a
passenger
train
as
it
is
on
a
freight
train.
that
--
that's
what
i
mean.
as
to
the
question
of
collisions,
i
urge
the
court
to
look
at
the
record
in
this
respect,
because
i
think
that
that
contained
extremely
persuasive
information.
on
pages
419
to
500
of
the
appendix,
on
pages
48
through
53
of
our
brief
in
chief,
we
answer
these
or
we
discuss
this
matter,
and
a
powerful
evidence
of
the
fact
that
the
kind
of
accidents
attributable
to
crew
performance
in
absence
of
crew
have
gone
up
startlingly.
since
the
crew
was
reduced
nationally,
now
--
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
in
the
appendix
it
was
pages
419
to
500,
a
testimony
of
mr.
homer.
there
were
charts
,
particular
charts
involving
collisions
on
many
pages,
including
pages
11,
68
to
69,
and
those
are
discussed
thoroughly
in
pages
48
through
53
of
our
original
brief.
the
railroad
suggest
that
the
whole
matter
here
can
be
explained
in
terms
of
reporting
requirements.
i
point
to
pages
6
and
7
of
our
reply
brief,
with
the
department
of
transportation
quotation,
in
pages
--
issued
on
april
10,
1968,
deals
with
the
matter
of
railroad
accidents
and
their
alarming
circumstances,
under
present
and
recently
developed
conditions.
same
thing
such
as
the
national
transportation
safety
board
review
of
data,
during
the
past
several
years
for
train
accidents
shows
progressively
worsening
trend
in
rates,
occurrences,
deaths,
and
damage.
now,
as
the
court
observed
in
questioning
mr.
lucente,
the
fact
that
the
casualties
may
have
dropped,
could
be
explained
by
many
thing.
now,
it
was
a
very
easy
way
to
handle
that,
used
as
an
exposure
factor,
as
a
factor
for
measuring
casualties
main
hours,
that's
what
everybody
uses
as
the
record
shows.
that's
what
the
railroad
use
in
other
context,
but
here
they
chose
to
measure
casualties
by
such
things
as
billion
gross
ton
miles.
obviously,
the
ton
miles
per
employee
is
going
up
great
as
the
crews
go
down,
as
passengers
go
down,
as
passengers
crews
go
down,
as
maintenance
of
rail
employees
go
down,
etcetera
and
as
car
loading
increases.
obviously,
when
you
measure
casualties
in
terms
of
billion
gross
ton
miles,
you're
going
to
get
some
kind
of
a
drop,
but
casualties
in
terms
of
some
of
kind
meaningful
explanation
do
not
at
all
result,
the
fact
is
they
have
risen
along
with
train
accidents
since
1964.
but
in
any
event,
about
all
these
statistics,
and
all
of
this
information,
there's
a
great
deal
of
it
in
the
record.
it
seems
to
us
that
this
is
a
peculiarly
legislative
decision,
the
cause
and
effect
kind
of
thing,
deciding
whether
it
really
was
caused
or
really
wasn't
caused
by
something
which
follow
another.
and
we
submit
that
this
is
a
matter
for
the
arkansas
legislature
to
determine.
we
concede
that
there's
been
trend,
legislative
trend
to
eliminate
full-crew
law.
we
think
we
can
reverse
it
with
these
statistics
i
just
been
talking
about,
and
we
look
forward
to
any
opportunity
we
have
on
that
respect,
but
hoped
that
it
not
be
done
to
this
traditional
process.
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
was
an
action
by
six
large
railroad
companies
in
a
three-judge
federal
court
in
arkansas
against
officials
of
the
state
of
arkansas
charged
with
enforcing
two
statutes.
the
first
applies
to
companies
with
it
at
least
50
miles
of
railroad
track,
when
those
companies
are
operating
freight
train
with
25
cars
or
more,
required
the
crew
of
an
engineer
of
firemen,
a
conductor,
and
three
brakemen.
the
second
statute
applies
to
railroad
companies
with
at
least
a
100
miles
of
track,
when
operating
a
switch
train
over
public
crossings
in
urban
communities.
it
requires
a
crew
of
an
engineer,
a
fireman,
a
foreman
and
three
helpers.
i
represent
four
railroad
brotherhoods
which
were
permitted
to
intervene
in
the
lower
courts,
speaking
for
the
employees
affected
by
these
statutes
of
full
crew
laws
in
question,
and
our
defendant
interveners,
the
defendant
appellants
in
this
case.
at
this
stage
of
a
case,
it's
the
second
time
this
case
has
been
here,
at
this
stage
of
a
case,
there
are
four
constitutional
issues.
the
court
below
found
that
the
statutes
violated
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
constitute
an
impermissible
burden
of
interstate
commerce.
the
railroads
also
urge
in
this
appeal
that
there
are
classification
infirmaries
in
the
law
in
violation
of
the
equal
protection
clause
and
indiscrimination
against
interstate
commerce.
the
normal
statement
of
the
case
would
not
apply
in
our
view
to
this
controversy
because
it
has
been
50
or
60
years
long,
when
the
opinion
of
the
court
has
written
in
this
case,
it
will
be
the
eleventh
entry
in
the
united
states'
reports
on
exactly
the
same
arkansas
statutes.
there's
been
extensive
substantive
discussion
of
the
same
constitutional
issues
involving
the
same
statutes
in
five
previous
opinions
of
this
court,
all
of
which
upheld
the
legislation
challenge.
but
evidently,
the
railroad
resources
are
inexhaustible,
and
we
are
back
again
arguing
substantially
the
same
issues
in
1968.
the
first
case
on
the
particular
statute
was
in
1911,
where
the
freight
crew
statute
was
upheld
against
three
constitutional
contentions.
the
railroads
there
argued
that
with
automatic
couplers
and
air
brakes,
a
third
brakeman
was
unnecessary
and
required
an
expenditure
of
a
needless
amount
of
money.
generally,
the
court
found
and
held
that
those
questions
even
then
were
concluded
by
former
decisions
involving
railroads
and
involving
similar
constitutional
issues.
as
to
the
commerce
clause,
we
found
no
violation
until
act
of
congress
displaces
the
legislation;
as
to
equal
protection,
several
previous
decisions
involving
mileage
classifications
were
noted;
and
as
to
due
process,
the
court
found
some
room
for
controversy,
but
found
the
statute
were
to
remain
to
the
object
for
this
legislature
had
in
view.
so,
even
if
deemed
unwise,
where
the
court
would
not
be
overruled
by
the
court.
the
1916
case
in
this
court
involved
the
switch
crew
statute.
more
summarily,
the
railroads
again,
this
court
again
upheld
the
statute
in
question.
this
time
there
were
again
commerce
clause,
equal
protection,
and
due
process
argument.
the
only
new
facts
that
the
railroad
brought
up
with
respect
to
that
statute
in
1916
was
that
the
switch
crew
statute
does
not
apply
to
train
of
a
25
car
length.
and
that
the
exemption
results
in
the
fact
that
the
covered
railroad
switch
over
the
same
crossing
as
non-covered
railroads,
therefore,
having
classification
infirmities.
the
court
know
that's
impossible
for
legislation
to
be
all
comprehensive,
that
the
grouping
was
reasonable
and
the
statute
should
be
upheld.
the
next
attempt
resulted
in
the
norwood
decision
of
this
court
in
1931.
this
time
there
were
four
constitutional
arguments:
due
process,
equal
protection,
commerce
clause,
and
the
supremacy
clause,
arguing
at
the
railway
labor
act
of
interstate
commerce,
comission
regulation
that
preempted
the
laws.
the
railroad
made
some
new
factual
contentions,
saying
if
there
was
improvement
in
road
and
equipment,
that
some
collective
bargaining
agreements
permitted
a
smaller
crew,
and
that
other
states
had
smaller
crews
and
operator
law
rights.
this
court
found
there
was
no
preemption
by
the
railway
labor
act.
the
other
constitutional
issues
were
in
substance
resolved.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
if
bad
faith
of
a
litigation,
dismissed
the
complaint
with
an
extensive
discussion
about
cost
of
compliance,
pointing
out
if
the
railroad
have
completely
failed
to
show
that
relative
cost
of
compliance
had
increased.
that
case
was
in
trial
on
the
merits
before
a
three-judge
court
in
the
west
district
of
arkansas
in
1933.
the
court
after
a
long
trial
and
extensive
consideration
issued
a
long
and
comprehensive
decision
going
down
fact
by
fact
of
arkansas
railroading
but
the
three-judge
court
at
that
point
thought
that
the
issues
were
limited
by
this
court
to
a
due
process
challenge
of
change
of
conditions
and
increased
relative
cost
of
compliance.
both
of
those
arguments
so
restricted
were
rejected
by
the
west
district
of
arkansas
which
upheld
the
statues,
this
court
affirmed
in
a
memorandum
opinion
of
the
same
year.
the
next
discussion
by
this
court
of
the
same
statute
in
question
was
in
the
landmark
southern
pacific
against
arizona
case
in
1945,
where
while
a
train
length
statute
of
arizona
was
invalidated
by
this
court,
this
court
in
our
view
took
great
pains
to
distinguish
the
full-crew
law
decisions
to
point
out
for
example
that
those
laws
do
require
such
impediments
of
interstate
commerce,
which
are
stopping
a
state
lines
to
pick
up
crew
members.
but
that
those
impediments
were
not
of
a
kind,
it
made
them
constitutionally
invalid,
and
pointed
out
that
there
in
lay
the
distinction
with
the
southern
pacific
against
arizona
burden
on
commerce
kind
of
rule.
the
next
consideration
by
this
court
of
the
arkansas
full-crew
law
was
in
1966,
in
this
same
case.
and
i
suggest
that
the
off
coast
to
the
court
on
the
preemption
issue,
which
was
the
primary
question
at
that
time,
the
lower
court
had
ruled
against
this
on
preemption,
and
we
appeal
and
this
court
reversed.
and
in
considering
a
preemption
question,
the
opinion
of
mr.
justice
black
noted
particularly
that
in
view
of
norwood
and
the
previous
cases,
that
even
the
preemption
issue
was
presented
narrowly,
that
it
has
specific
things
happens
since
1933,
to
change
the
1933
decision
about
preemption.
the
court
found
in
the
'61
decision,
it
had
not.
the
law
was
upheld,
the
discrimination
against
the
interstate
commerce
argumentally
with
the
railroads
in
1966
was
also
rejected
on
the
record
before
the
court
at
that
time.
further,
all
recent
reported
decision
on
the
same
issues
by
course
of
other
jurisdictions,
outside
of
a
decision
we're
appealing
from
here
today,
have
upheld
the
constitutionality
of
similar
laws.
the
indiana
supreme
court
refused
even
to
take
evidence
on
change
of
conditions,
saying
it's
a
matter
for
the
legislature.
the
ohio
open
courts
rejected
all
the
identical
constitutional
contentions.
the
new
york
courts
were
extremely
persuasive
opinions,
analyzed
at
great
length
that
new
york
full-crew
statute
is
very
similar
to
those
of
arkansas
at
time
of
the
trial,
rejected
the
railroad
arguments,
upheld
the
statutes.
it
was
affirmed
by
the
appellate
division,
and
about
two
weeks
ago,
it
was
affirmed
4
to
3
by
the
new
york
court
of
appeals.
the
record
here
is
massive
and
it
is
extremely
difficult
to
brief
or
argue
the
detailed
facts
of
dozens
and
dozens
of
witnesses
who
gave
opinions
and
reasons
for
their
opinions.
pages
and
pages,
and
exhibits
and
huge
exchanges
of
information
about
railroading.
i
question
whether
would
be
advisable
in
any
event
to
reiterate
the
intensive
discussions
about
the
duties
of
firemen,
duties
of
brakemen
and
switchmen.
that
discussion
has
been
engaged
in
so
many
times
by
so
many
tribunals
and
have
been
substantially
the
same
that
there's
argument
on
both
sides,
that
there
is
room
for
judgment
by
reasonable
men
on
both
ways.
the
judgment
in
this
instance
of
the
state
of
arkansas
on
its
legislative
process
was
that
it
is
important
to
the
safety
of
the
state
to
have
these
statutes.
as
to
the
duty
of
the
fireman,
the
most
notable
kind
of
situation
is
that
firemen,
in
the
sense
of
a
man
shoveling
coal
into
a
great
have
long
time
seized.
the
firemen
in
the
sense
of
maintaining
the
mode
of
power,
providing
inspection
and
lookout
in
relief
and
emergency
duties
have
under
sophisticated
modern
conditions
of
railroading
have
and
continued
to
exercise
is
extremely
important
functions.
as
to
brakemen,
the
outstanding
conclusion
from
the
extensive
record
in
this
case
is
a
brakemen
do
substantially
now
what
they
get
in
1933.
they
do
a
substantially,
then
the
court
said
what
they
did
in
1916
and
1911,
the
previous
analysis
of
this
statute
by
this
court.
as
to
equipment
and
facilities,
the
evidence
is
that
certainly
there
have
been
some
improvements
in
railroad
conditions,
railroad
equipment
or
railroad
facilities.
certainly
as
well,
there
have
been
some
factors
which
have
made
railroading
more
dangerous
than
railroading
was
in
1933
and
1960,
and
1911,
and
1945.
there
are
faster
and
longer,
and
heavier
trains,
which
are
deteriorating,
and
deteriorate
the
equipment
and
the
crossings
over
which
they
pass.
there
is
this
factor
combined
with
items
like
heavier
highway
traffic,
the
school
bus
program,
for
example
in
arkansas,
the
record
shows,
was
unknown
at
the
time
of
the
norwood
case.
now,
it's
a
large
program
involving
the
transportation
of
hundreds
or
thousand
of
children
over
the
crossing
of
these
trains
passed.
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
yes
your
honor,
that's
the
most
important
aspect
of
our
argument.
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
that
is
also
our
argument
with
respect
to
the
burden
on
commerce.
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
that
is
certainly
true,
your
honor.
my
response
to
that
would
be
this,
that
the
first
evaluation
is
by
the
arkansas
legislature.
the
second
evaluation
is
judicial
if
it
has
not
had
held
from
congress.
in
this
instance,
there
is
a
legislative
evaluation
of
a
kind
of
thing
which
this
court
did
in
southern
pacific
against
arizona
for
example.
the
intensive/extensive
evidence
was
taken
on
the
importance
of
crews
to
safety
before
congress.
and
the
last
decision
of
this
court
analyze
some
of
that
legislative
history.
congress
decided
expressly,
at
least
in
expressed
legislative
history,
not
to
preempt,
still
this
court
found.
the
reason
for
that
decision,
we
would
submit
is
a
determination
on
the
merit
if
there's
some
ground
for
states
making
these
decisions.
i
would
suggest
that
that
would
be
of
considerable
impact
of
the
evaluation
of
this
court,
even
under
the
burden
on
commerce
argument.
we
contend
that
there
are
--
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
equal
protection
and
--
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
yes
your
honor.
perhaps
i
might
refer
briefly
to
them
right
now
because
i
had
not
intended
to
later
on.
both
of
them
say
that
they
are
classifications,
which
are
somehow
rigid.
perhaps
the
cases
aren't
firm.
our
first
argument
as
to
those
is
that
those
questions
have
been
resolved
before.
the
primary
basis
for
the
exemption
argument,
the
50
and
100-miliage
of
track
made
by
the
railroads
is
that
exempt
company
switch
over
the
same
crossings
is
non-exempt
companies.
this
exact
point
was
discussed
and
was
a
major
element
of
discussion.
in
the
1916
arkansas
full-crew
case
in
this
court,
st.
louis
iron
mountain,
southern
railway
against
arkansas,
fighting
that
while
--
maybe
the
classification
wasn't
perfect.
there
seem
to
be
a
considerable
differences
between
50-mile
and
a
100-mile
railroads
and
large
railroads.
there
was
a
fact
--
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
well,
that
is
true
your
honor,
but
a
good
deal
has
not
happened
in
our
view
to
arkansas
railroading
with
respect
to
that
kind
of
fact.
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
well,
we
can
think
of
several
things,
the
record
shows
the
following
kind
of
fact.
the
smaller
companies
have
lower
speeds,
whereas
the
companies
that
are
appellees
in
this
case
go
75
miles
an
hour.
the
only
evidence
in
the
record
on
the
exempted
company
shows
speed
limits
of
35
miles
an
hour
for
the
company
i
happen
to
recall.
the
evidence
shows
that
the
railroads
represented
as
the
appellees
in
this
case
have
trains
of
a
150
cars
long.
whereas
the
trains
represented
by
the
exempted
companies,
the
record
shows,
have
consistently
shorter
trains.
for
example,
it
is
customarily
the
movement
of
one
or
two,
or
five,
or
seven
cars
of
this
court
in
southern
pacific
against
arizona,
recognizing
--
recognized
the
increase
danger
involved
in
longer
trains.
the
50-mile
railroad
company
exemption
has
been
repeatedly
upheld
by
this
court.
and
in
1950,
in
morey
against
doud,
this
court
observed
that
there
was
particularly,
that
that
50-mile
railroad
exemption
was
a
kind
of
classification,
which
was
sustainable
as
contrasted
with
the
classification
which
was
involved
in
that
particular
case.
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
no
your
honor,
something
of
a
sort,
purely
50
miles
and
100
miles.
now,
after
the
interstate
as
against
intrastate
discrimination
argument,
there
is
not
a
perfect
correlation
--
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
either
way
it's
in
classification
is
infirmed
in
some
way.
now,
as
to
those
arguments,
the
record
in
a
number
of
respects
shows
important
distinctions.
furthermore,
the
interstate/intrastate
dichotomy
does
not
fit
the
exemption
dichotomy.
in
other
words,
there
are
interstate
railroad
not
covered
by
the
statute
because
they
do
not
have
50
or
100
miles
of
line
and
vice
versa.
and
so
it
is
not
a
perfect
as
the
railroads
would
probably
suggest,
but
the
facts
of
the
record
show
that
it's
not.
again,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
class
of
that
particular
railroad
classification
principle
by
mileage
of
track
has
been
upheld
for
a
hundred
years
in
respect
to
regulatory
statutes
and
safety
statute
by
this
court.
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
yes
your
honor
and
the
long
opinion
in
the
case
of
the
opinion
of
supreme
court,
the
trial
court,
which
is
a
very
careful
discussion
of
that
to
deal
in
detail
with
it,
i
do
not
recall
whether
or
not
the
court
of
appeals
refer
to
that
particular
thing
or
not.
one
further
aspect
to
the
50
to
100-mile
classification,
which
would
support
the
classification
that
such
in
our
view,
the
railroads
have
make
a
great
argument
of
the
fact
that
the
cost
of
compliance
is
high.
i
would
like
to
say
something
about
that
in
a
moment,
but
if
the
cost
of
compliance
is
a
factor
and
clearly
it
could
be,
the
smaller
railroad
companies
as
i
suppose
are
less
able
to
assume
the
cost
of
compliance
with
these
statutes
and
that
might
legitimately
be
a
factor
in
a
classification,
not
one
which
we
would
rely
on
wholly
but
certainly
a
factor.
outside
of
the
multitude
of
evidence
on
the
duties
of
employees
and
the
equipment
and
facilities
of
the
railroads,
the
most
persuasive
part
of
a
record
altogether
in
our
view
is
a
mass
of
statistical
material.
this
is
the
first
time
in
arkansas
full-crew
law
cases
of
a
many
that
have
been
in
this
court
and
the
first
time
in
any
full-crew
law
case
and
other
jurisdiction
that
i
know
of,
where
we
now
have
experienced
to
look
at,
because
in
april
1964,
with
the
effect
of
the
1963
legislation
of
congress,
railroads
did
in
fact
reduced
their
operating
crew
substantially.
most
firemen
were
taken
off
at
a
very
rapid
rate
and
a
good
many
in
a
slower
rate,
brakemen
and
switchmen
were
taken
off.
as
a
result
of
that,
we
have
now
a
period
of
time
to
look
at
and
i
submit
that
the
statistics
from
this
period
are
most
persuasive
about
the
connection
between
these
statutes
and
safety.
and
at
the
very
least,
establish
the
right
of
the
arkansas
legislature
and
the
arkansas
people,
because
it's
also
been
voted
on
populatory
in
arkansas
to
make
the
cause
and
effect
determination,
resulting
from
those
statistics.
clearly
from
this
evidence
that
railroading
is
a
very
hazardous
business
and
continues
to
be,
clearly
number
two,
that
beginning
in
april
1964
many
crewmen
have
been
take
off
of
trains
nationally,
large
percentage
dropped.
three,
clearly
since
april
1964
or
may,
railroad
accidents
have
increased
substantially.
and
number
four,
that
when
you
analyze
those
accidents
and
you
find
those
that
are
most
attributable
to
crew
side
and
crew
performance,
those
accidents
have
increased,
especially
and
the
rate
of
those
accidents
have
increased
especially.
now,
a
causal
--
a
cause
and
effect
decision
we
say
as
primarily
legislative,
but
there
are
some
things
to
assist
in
that
kind
of
evaluation
here.
for
example,
collisions,
it
is
conceded
by
all
the
parties
that
collisions
are
that
type
of
accidents,
most
attributable
to
crew
performance.
accidents
went
up
--
have
gone
up
for
a
period
of
time,
but
beginning
exactly
at
the
time
when
many
most
firemen
were
taken
off
of
freight
trains
in
this
country,
collisions
sky
rocketed.
the
rate
of
increase
changed
entirely
as
to
collisions.
for
example
further,
causes
of
accidents,
causes
such
as
disregard
of
stop
signals,
failure
to
secure
handbrakes,
running
through
switches,
failure
of
the
engineer
to
keep
a
look
out,
that
kind
of
thing,
most
attributable
to
employee
performance.
the
rate
of
such
accidents,
accidents
from
such
causes
also
rose
sharply
beginning
in
april
or
may
1964,
extremely
important
causal
factor.
now,
the
railroads
are
hardpressed
to
answer
this
kind
of
testimony.
they
answer
it
partly
by
using
improper
statistical
techniques.
for
example,
let's
say
casualties
have
not
gone
up,
because
they
measure
casualties
by
billion
grossed
ton-miles.
a
kind
of
exposure
factor
which
no
one
else
uses
and
even
the
railroads
and
other
context,
the
record
shows
do
not
use.
they
compare
one
year
with
another
one
year,
instead
of
comparing
periods
of
time.
the
claimant
there
had
been
reporting
defects
and
that
the
amount
of
train
accident,
dollar
damage,
in
order
to
justify
a
report
has
stayed
constant
for
the
last
several
years.
but
the
fact
that
the
department
of
transportation
of
the
united
states
government
has
found
a
startling
and
alarming
rise
and
it
repeatedly
has
told
congress
that
we
need
assistance
in
the
railroad
accidents
field,
which
in
the
last
few
years
had
become
more
and
more
serious
to
the
point
of
real
dangerous
calamity.
they
say
that
the
accident
rate
was
increasing
all
along,
but
again
it's
possible
to
isolate
that
kind
of
accident,
which
is
most
attributable
to
crew
performance,
and
furthermore
the
rate
of
the
increase
that
the
department
of
transportation
notes,
the
rate
of
increase
has
gone
up
higher
in
the
years,
since
1964
than
it
have
been
going
up
since
that
time.
but
even
under
the
railroad
statistics,
comparing
1962
and
1966,
the
railroads
with
more
firemen
had
a
smaller
increase
in
the
collision
rate.
over
the
largest
reported
in
a
full-crew
states
had
better
accident
and
casualty
rate
experience
than
non
full-crew
states.
arkansas
train
accidents
have
been
increasing
at
a
slower
rate
than
state
with
smaller
operating
crews.
during
the
period
with
the
same
traffic
density,
casualty
rates
are
no
less
for
diesel
and
for
steam
locomotives,
and
comparing
pre-1964
and
post-1964
experience,
arkansas
now
have
a
smaller
percentage
of
the
national
casualties,
during
the
time
where
those
crew
sides
had
been
proportionately
larger.
one
aspect
of
a
railroad's
case
which
we
contend
they
have
totally
failed
to
prove,
is
the
aspect
of
cost
of
compliance.
both
in
commerce
clause,
the
burden
on
commerce
cases
and
in
due
process
cases,
the
cost
of
compliance
had
been
a
major
consideration
by
this
court.
the
standards
for
the
full-crew
cases
have
been
laid
out
expressly
and
in
detail
by
this
court,
in
the
1931
norwood
decision.
this
court
pointed
out
that
it's
not
enough
to
say
why
we
have
to
spend
so
much
money
last
year,
but
there
has
to
be
a
relative
cost
factor
presented
to
the
court.
it
has
to
relate
to
the
operation
of
those
employees
per
ton,
per
car,
per
mile,
per
something,
and
to
say
that
we
spent
$5.00
more
this
year
than
we
spent
in
last,
has
no
due
process
relevance.
the
railroads
have
this
in
front
of
them
and
yet,
they
totally
failed
to
acknowledge
in
this
case.
they
simply
put
an
evidence
saying
we
spent
$7
million
in
arkansas
in
1966
or
1965
in
complying
with
the
statute.
and
on
cross
examination,
they
said,
“well,
we
added
up
all
the
wages
of
the
firemen
and
all
the
wages
of
the
third
brakemen
or
switchmen
and
that's
$7
million.”
now,
that
alone
is
not
enough,
but
we
have
more
in
this
record,
which
reveal
the
deficiency
as
to
this
aspect
of
the
case.
we
have
accidentally
the
operating
papers
used
by
one
of
appellee
railroads,
kansas
city
southern,
in
making
their
cost
of
compliance
calculations,
in
which
the
actual
mileage
expense
in
arkansas
for
train
crewmen,
people
in
the
back
part
of
the
train,
and
for
engine
crewmen,
the
firemen
and
the
engineer
is
presented.
and
the
startling
result,
totally
uncontradictory
in
this
record,
the
startling
result
from
these
figures
is
that
kansas
city
southern
did
not
experience
any
increase,
in
cost
of
compliance
per
mile
of
arkansas
railroading
after
the
change
in
national
crews
in
the
other
states
in
which
operates
and
up-to-date
or
up
to
the
period
covered
in
the
evidence.
in
other
words,
railroads
have
failed
generally
as
to
this
point.
when
we
look
farther
towards
the
kind
of
formulas
which
norwood
command,
we
find
there's
some
evidence
and
that
evidence
show
that
there's
no
cost
of
compliance
at
all.
i
found
as
startling
when
i
first
heard
it
and
we
began
to
inquire
and
there's
evidence
about
what
some
of
the
causes
might
be.
certainly,
the
railroads
have
ignored
for
example
the
fact
that
in
places
where
engineers
ride
without
a
fireman
or
firemen
are
not
required,
the
have
to
pay
an
extra
allowance
to
the
engineers,
ignored
completely
by
the
railroad.
certainly,
everyone
can
see
in
the
record,
and
the
railroads
make
a
big
point
of
this
in
their
briefs,
that
with
a
smaller
crew,
it
takes
a
longer
time
to
operate
a
train,
with
a
longer
time,
it
kicks
in
certain
constructive
and
progressive
allowances,
which
the
people
who
are
on
the
crew
have
to
be
paid.
certainly,
there
is
substantial
evidence
in
which
the
court,
i'm
certain
that
legislative
could
conclude
that
the
accident
rate
goes
up
startlingly
with
a
smaller
crew,
and
that
this
perhaps
account
for.
but
in
any
event,
the
only
evidence
showing
related
cost
of
compliance,
not
related
to
one
year
to
other
as
a
railroads
argue,
but
related
as
to
the
kind
of
performance
of
these
crew
members
shows
that
there
is
virtually
no
cost
of
compliance
at
all.
this
is
in
our
view
a
perfect
case
for
the
application
of
the
principle
that
this
court
does
not
fit
as
a
super
legislature,
and
a
perfect
illustration
of
why
that
is
so
is
the
opinion
of
a
court
below,
because
the
opinion
of
the
court
below
is
no
more
or
less
in
our
view
than
a
report
of
a
committee,
a
legislative
committee
saying
why
they
would
like
to
change
the
law.
it
does
not
as
was
the
norwood
case,
it
does
not
as
was
the
new
york
case
a
careful
fact
by
fact,
detail
by
detail
analysis
of
what
firemen
do
and
what
brakemen
do,
and
what
locomotives
do,
and
what
the
crossing
hazards
are
and
all
those
things.
it
is
rather
a
general
discussion
of
why
the
judges
think
that
the
full-crew
library
economically
unwise,
why
are
they
unhappy
with
them.
they
say
for
example
that
we
suspect
their
primary
paragraph
on
the
evidence
in
the
case.
it
says
the
record
is
voluminous
and
massive,
and
there
are
films
and
pictures
and
testimony
of
dozens
and
dozens
of
witnesses,
and
depositions
and
so
on,
and
said,
“we
are
not
going
to
make
any
attempt
to
discuss
this."
probably,
we
suspect
that
much
of
it
is
surplusage.
how
can
a
court
suspect
that
massive
record
is
surplusage,
if
it
has
made
a
factual
analysis?
an
an
analysis
which
would
properly
underlie
a
conclusion
that
there
is
no
conceivable
germane
connection
between
a
legitimate
state
purpose,
the
safety
of
its
public
and
it's
railroad
men
and
the
statue
in
question.
the
court
below
notes
that
the
legislation
hamstrings
labor
relations
and
worries
about
the
effect
on
the
railroad
in
competition
with
a
coming
barge
traffic
in
the
arkansas
river.
these
are
classically
legislative
determinations
and
certainly
not
a
basis
for
constitutional
invalidations
such
with
that
of
a
court
below
--
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
yes
your
honor.
there
are
two
statutes,
one
freight
was
generally
for
over
the
road
service
and
one
switching
for
a
switching
in
yards.
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
as
far
as
--
as
far
as
any
legal
standard,
i
don't
see
a
difference
at
all.
there
are
some
factual
differences,
a
substantial
one.
for
example,
the
railroads
argue
that
when
a
train
is
on
the
road,
that
they
can
put
an
extra
brakemen
in
the
cab,
thereby
making
firemen
unnecessary.
this
is
not
true
in
a
yard,
where
all
the
brakemen
have
to
be
passing
signals
and
things
to
that
kind
and
the
firemen
himself
has
to
be
passing
signals
to
their
factual
differences
in
the
functions
of
the
people
involved.
but
in
so
far
as
the
legal
arguments,
your
honor,
i
see
no
difference
whatsoever.
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
well,
there
is
the
--
that
difference
and
that
that
applies
only
to
the
freight
crew
law,
i
presume
or
the
burden
on
commerce
argument
would
apply
only
to
the
freight
crew
law,
because
the
switching
crews
are
not
an
interstate
kind
of
situation.
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
that's
correct.
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
well,
that's
correct,
but
--
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
well,
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record.
or
the
evidence
in
the
record
consists
of
this
kind
of
thing,
the
railroad
say
that
at
x
location,
in
x
tower
in
arkansas,
100-mile
companies
and
less
than
100-mile
companies
switch
across
the
same
crossing
with
different
size
crew
as
a
result
of
the
statute.
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
that
is
correct.
that
is,
however,
a
limited
condition.
the
intercity
large
companies
and
their
distinction
in
the
statute
is
not
interstate/intrastate
and
the
classification
does
not
--
is
not
contiguous.
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
that
is
correct.
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
with
reference
to
mr.
justice
white's
last
point
in
the
general
issue
about
the
justification
of
a
100-mile
classification
in
switch
crews
--
switch
yard,
to
be
overly
candid
perhaps,
i
shutter
at
the
fact
of
going
back
to
try
those
case,
again
we've
(voice
overlap).
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
certainly
that
is
correct.
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
certainly,
that
is
correct.
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
yes.
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
well,
i
understand
your
honor
that
the
compelling
principle
in
a
constitutional
challenge
is
that
the
plaintiffs
had
a
burden
of
showing
that
the
laws
is
unconstitutional.
now,
there
are
cases
that
the
court
is
well
familiar
with,
which
state
that
if
any
state
of
facts
known
a
reasonably
can
be
conceived
that
would
support
the
classification
if
that's
sufficient.
now,
there's
a
good
deal
of
evidence
in
here
that
the
covered
companies
--
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
well,
i
don't
understand
commerce
to
be
involved
in
a
particular
--
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
well,
your
honor,
as
to
discriminate
against
interstate
commerce,
our
primary
answer
would
be
that
the
two
groups
are
not
all
contiguous
well-formed
interstate
covered,
intrastate
not
covered,
to
the
contrary
without
going
into
detail
at
this
time.
as
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
there's
justification
for
100-mile
classification
in
yard
operations,
the
evidence
shows
that
companies
operate
longer
trains
that
are
covered,
that
are
not
covered,
and
that
longer
cost
of
cars
are
operated
in
contrary
that
as
mr.
lucente
said
that
are
covered,
that
are
not
covered.
the
evidence
shows
that
the
companies
that
are
covered
carry
more
volatile
materials
for
example.
materials
that
tend
to
have
more
opportunity
to
blow
up
and
blow
up
a
whole
town
and
company
that
are
not
covered.
furthermore,
we
would
rely
heavily
on
the
many
years
of
decisions
by
this
court
about
mileage
classifications
and
particularly
the
1916
decision
in
this
case,
in
which
equal
protection
involve
and
all
classification
arguments
involved
only
the
arkansas
switching
crew
as
distinguished
from
the
road
freight
statute.
in
reference
to
the
question
about
one
of
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
rule
on
this
point,
if
i
may
quote
just
a
sentence
or
two
from
the
decision
of
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
about
two
weeks
ago,
“plaintiffs
do
not
establish
on
the
record,
that
the
statute
deny
them
equal
protection
of
the
laws.
differences
in
the
impact
of
statutes
depend
for
validity
and
the
rationality,
the
difference,
citing
morey
against
doud,
and
some
differences
applying
to
specifically
the
railroad
have
been
sustained
by
this
court,
citing
new
york
central
against
williams,
which
was
one
of
the
case
that
we
rely
on
in
the
previous
arkansas
full-crew
case.”
it
goes
on
to
discuss
that
further
at
length.
i'm
sure
the
court
rule
for
me
where
i
result
with.
as
to
--
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
we
would
be
glad
to
make
them
available
your
honor,
it
was
just
issues
about
two
weeks
ago.
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
i
will,
yes
your
honor,
thank
you.
as
to
the
question
about
whether
or
not
there's
a
passenger
crew
statute,
i
want
to
emphasize
that
there
is
a
full-crew
law
statute
in
arkansas
applying
to
passenger
trains.
the
railroads
have
on
some
past
instances
challenge
that
statute,
they
do
not
hear,
for
reasons
which
i
suggest
to
have
some
value
in
this
court's
consideration
now.
as
to
the
questions
of
collision
--
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
i
don't
understand
--
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
i
don't
understand
why,
if
they
contend
that
it's
just
as
safe
not
to
have
a
fireman,
and
not
just
a
safe
on
a
passenger
train
as
it
is
on
a
freight
train.
that
--
that's
what
i
mean.
as
to
the
question
of
collisions,
i
urge
the
court
to
look
at
the
record
in
this
respect,
because
i
think
that
that
contained
extremely
persuasive
information.
on
pages
419
to
500
of
the
appendix,
on
pages
48
through
53
of
our
brief
in
chief,
we
answer
these
or
we
discuss
this
matter,
and
a
powerful
evidence
of
the
fact
that
the
kind
of
accidents
attributable
to
crew
performance
in
absence
of
crew
have
gone
up
startlingly.
since
the
crew
was
reduced
nationally,
now
--
mr.
james
e.
youngdahl
in
the
appendix
it
was
pages
419
to
500,
a
testimony
of
mr.
homer.
there
were
charts
,
particular
charts
involving
collisions
on
many
pages,
including
pages
11,
68
to
69,
and
those
are
discussed
thoroughly
in
pages
48
through
53
of
our
original
brief.
the
railroad
suggest
that
the
whole
matter
here
can
be
explained
in
terms
of
reporting
requirements.
i
point
to
pages
6
and
7
of
our
reply
brief,
with
the
department
of
transportation
quotation,
in
pages
--
issued
on
april
10,
1968,
deals
with
the
matter
of
railroad
accidents
and
their
alarming
circumstances,
under
present
and
recently
developed
conditions.
same
thing
such
as
the
national
transportation
safety
board
review
of
data,
during
the
past
several
years
for
train
accidents
shows
progressively
worsening
trend
in
rates,
occurrences,
deaths,
and
damage.
now,
as
the
court
observed
in
questioning
mr.
lucente,
the
fact
that
the
casualties
may
have
dropped,
could
be
explained
by
many
thing.
now,
it
was
a
very
easy
way
to
handle
that,
used
as
an
exposure
factor,
as
a
factor
for
measuring
casualties
main
hours,
that's
what
everybody
uses
as
the
record
shows.
that's
what
the
railroad
use
in
other
context,
but
here
they
chose
to
measure
casualties
by
such
things
as
billion
gross
ton
miles.
obviously,
the
ton
miles
per
employee
is
going
up
great
as
the
crews
go
down,
as
passengers
go
down,
as
passengers
crews
go
down,
as
maintenance
of
rail
employees
go
down,
etcetera
and
as
car
loading
increases.
obviously,
when
you
measure
casualties
in
terms
of
billion
gross
ton
miles,
you're
going
to
get
some
kind
of
a
drop,
but
casualties
in
terms
of
some
of
kind
meaningful
explanation
do
not
at
all
result,
the
fact
is
they
have
risen
along
with
train
accidents
since
1964.
but
in
any
event,
about
all
these
statistics,
and
all
of
this
information,
there's
a
great
deal
of
it
in
the
record.
it
seems
to
us
that
this
is
a
peculiarly
legislative
decision,
the
cause
and
effect
kind
of
thing,
deciding
whether
it
really
was
caused
or
really
wasn't
caused
by
something
which
follow
another.
and
we
submit
that
this
is
a
matter
for
the
arkansas
legislature
to
determine.
we
concede
that
there's
been
trend,
legislative
trend
to
eliminate
full-crew
law.
we
think
we
can
reverse
it
with
these
statistics
i
just
been
talking
about,
and
we
look
forward
to
any
opportunity
we
have
on
that
respect,
but
hoped
that
it
not
be
done
to
this
traditional
process.
