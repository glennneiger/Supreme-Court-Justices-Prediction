mr.
martin
m.
lucente
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
presentation
will
deal
primarily
with
the
factual
basis
for
the
lower
court's
determination
at
the
arkansas
statutes,
they're
not
reasonably
related
to
safety.
and
i
will
in
the
course
of
that,
mr.
chief
justice,
discuss
the
collisions
to
which
you
have
referred
and
which
you
asked
mr.
light
about.
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
discuss
a
preliminary
matter
before
getting
to
that
particular
subject.
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
under
safety
issue,
the
district
court
made
several
critical
findings.
it
found
first
that
from
the
overwhelming
weight
of
the
evidence
that
since
the
mid-1950s,
neither
the
firemen
on
the
diesel
locomotive
nor
the
third
brakemen
or
helper
contributed
to
safety
of
railroad
operations.
the
district
court
also
found
without
regard
to
employee
categories
that
trains
have
been
operated
safely
in
other
parts
of
the
united
states
for
many
years,
with
crews
of
less
than
six
men
that
size
required
by
the
arkansas
statute.
and
that
the
training
operations
with
these
small
crews
had
been
conducted
with
safety.
and
finally,
the
district
court
concluded
from
the
evidence
as
a
whole,
under
present
conditions,
continued
enforcement
of
the
statutes
makes
no
significant
contribution
to
railroad
safety.
in
reaching
these
conclusions
and
making
these
findings,
the
district
court
relied
heavily
on
evidence,
have
comparable
and
safe
operations
with
smaller
crews.
in
other
cases
involving
identical
issues,
the
courts
have
relied
on
the
same
type
of
evidence.
in
the
warrenburg
case
which
is
referred
to
and
discussed
in
our
brief,
the
court
relied
on
evidence
of
comparable
and
safe
operations
with
44
ton
yards
switching
diesels
without
a
fireman
and
found
the
ordinance
requiring
a
fireman
on
that
type
of
equipment
to
be
unconstitutional.
in
the
southern
pacific
case
particularly,
this
court
relied
extensively
on
evidence
of
safe
operations
in
states
outside
of
arizona,
operating
three
of
the
70
car
limitation
imposed
by
arizona.
and
it
concluded
on
the
basis
of
such
safe
operations
in
other
states
that
the
arizona
limitation
had
no
reasonable
relation
to
safety.
the
record
in
the
present
case
permits
the
same
type
of
comparison
and
strongly
supports
the
district
court's
conclusion
that
the
statutory
requirements
at
issue
do
not
promote
safety
of
operations.
this
comparative
evaluation
is
greatly
facilitated
by
the
changes
in
crew
size,
which
have
occurred
since
1964
as
a
result
of
the
award
of
arbitration
board
number
282.
that
award
which
was
applicable
to
virtually
every
major
railroad
in
the
united
states
has
resulted
in
the
elimination
of
a
majority
of
the
firemen's
positions
and
a
reduction
in
the
number
of
brakemen
and
helpers
used
on
crews
in
road
and
yard
service.
there's
also
available
for
the
same
period
of
time,
extensive
data
relating
to
safety
of
operations.
this
data
permits
a
comparison
of
the
safety
of
railroad
operations
over
a
period
of
time,
and
it
also
permits
a
geographic
comparison
between
states.
and
when
this
information,
with
respect
to
safety
of
operations
is
properly
related
to
the
change
in
crew
size
which
have
occurred
since
1964,
it
is
possible
to
draw
conclusions
as
to
the
relative
safety
of
operations
with
crews
of
different
sizes
under
comparable
conditions.
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
no,
we
do
not
your
honor.
our
basic
point
is
that
the
extra
men
required
do
not
make
any
contribution
to
safety,
the
operation
is
as
safe
with
the
four-man
crew
as
it
is
with
the
six-man
crew.
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
no,
we
do
not
make
--
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
no,
we
don't
have
that
argument
here,
your
honor.
perhaps
the
most
graphic
of
the
comparisons
which
the
record
permits
involves
the
arkansas
operations
of
the
plaintiff
railroads
in
this
case
and
their
operations
in
other
states.
as
these
railroads
reduced
the
crews
under
the
provisions
of
the
award
of
arbitration
board
number
282,
it
became
and
it
remains
common
place
for
trains
and
through
service
on
this
railroads
to
operate
with
identical
characteristics
through
arkansas
and
adjacent
states,
except
for
differences
in
crew
size,
the
size
of
the
train,
its
motor
power,
the
frequency
or
infrequency
of
stops,
the
characteristics
of
tracks,
signal
protection
and
terrain
remain
incomparable.
only
the
size
of
the
crew
changes
from
the
four-man
crew
in
other
states
to
the
six-man
crew
required
by
the
arkansas
statute.
trains
of
the
frisco
railroad
operating
over
its
main
line
to
missouri,
arkansas,
on
tennessee
undergo
these
crew
changes
as
they
pass
in
to
weiner
of
arkansas.
trains
of
the
rock
island
operating
from
tennessee
to
new
mexico
have
the
same
experience,
going
from
four-man
crews
in
other
states
to
six-man
crews
in
arkansas.
and
the
missouri
pacific
and
cotton
belt
have
a
large
volume
of
interstate
operations,
which
also
proceeds
identical
in
operating
features
and
characteristics,
except
for
differences
in
crew
size.
now,
in
yard
services,
mr.
light
has
pointed
out
there
are
instances
where
a
border
bisects
the
yard
and
where
four-man
crews
do
a
switching
in
one
part
of
the
yard
and
six-man
crew
do
the
switching
on
occasions
when
they
are
required
to
go
into
arkansas.
the
other
part
of
the
record
on
this,
in
addition
to
the
changes
in
crew
size
is
the
evidence
which
shows
the
relative
safety
of
operations
of
the
plaintiff
railroads
in
arkansas
and
in
other
states.
the
record
shows
that
during
the
five-year
period,
which
the
most
recent
five-year
period
available
at
the
time
of
the
trial,
from
1961
to
1966,
casualties
arising
from
train
operations
were
reduced
by
13%
in
arkansas
and
16%
in
other
states
through
which
the
plaintiff
railroads
operate.
i'm
referring
now
to
the
reportable
causalities
comprehended
by
the
regulations
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
casualties
were
reduced
in
both
arkansas
and
in
other
states,
but
the
reduction
in
other
states
on
the
plaintiff
railroad
is
greater
than
in
arkansas.
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
casualities,
the
injuries
to
burden.
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
yes,
accidents
your
honor
are
comprehended
under
the
interstate
commerce
commission
term
of
train
accidents.
a
train
accident
to
be
reportable
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission
must
involve
one
basic
requirement.
it
must
involve
property
damage
to
railroad
equipment
arising
out
of
the
operation
of
trains
of
at
least
$750.00.
since
1961,
there
has
been
a
trend
of
increases
in
train
accidents
reportable
to
the
commission,
and
train
accidents
also
comprehend
collisions.
collisions
are
one
of
the
categories
within
the
train
accident
category.
there
has
been
an
increase
in
train
accidents
reportable
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission
since
1961.
but
the
fact
is
that
casualties,
injuries
to
people
arising
out
of
those
incidents
has
been
declining
since
1961,
so
that
by
1967,
there's
a
25%
reduction
in
the
casualties
or
injuries
to
people
arising
from
these
train
accidents.
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
the
evidence,
your
honor,
shows
that
the
reason
for
this
increase
in
reportable
train
accidents
is
primarily
the
fact
that
the
standard
is
stated
in
terms
of
damage
to
equipment
and
that
one
of
the
features
involved
in
determining
the
damage
to
equipment
is
the
amount
of
cost
involved
in
repairing
the
equipment.
and
this
$750.00
standard,
which
has
remained
inflexible
since
1961,
has
resulted
in
an
increasing
number
of
incidents
falling
within
the
reporting
requirements,
as
equipment
cost
had
increased,
as
labor
cost
have
gone
up,
the
proportion
of
incidences,
in
which
in
this
--
becomes
a
reportable
train
accident
has
also
increase.
so
that
the
basic
point
that
the
record
establishes
in
this
connection,
is
that
in
so
far
as
safety
is
concerned,
in
terms
of
injuries
to
people,
that
there
has
been
improvement
in
that
and
that
there
has
been
at
least
a
comparable
improvement
in
states
which
do
not
require
six-man
crews.
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
that
could
account
for
some
of
them
your
honor,
but
the
fact
is
that
only
a
very
small
number
of
train
accidents
have
a
potential
for
casualties.
the
reported
data
for
1967
shows
approximately
7200
train
accidents.
the
reportable
casualties
for
1967
to
persons
arising
out
of
train
accidents
is
924,
when
--
so
on
its
phase,
the
924
against
the
7000
produces
something
in
the
vicinity
of
10%
of
train
accidents
that
result
in
casualties
of
any
kind.
and
when
the
casualties
in
train
accidents
are
allocated
to
specific
accidents,
so
that
you
take
into
account
the
fact
that
some
produce
two
casualties,
others
do
not
produce
any,
only
6.5%
of
the
train
accidents
involve
casualties.
so,
our
basic
point
is
that
the
discussion
of
train
accidents,
the
emphasis
and
what
has
happened
to
train
accidents,
is
a
concern
with
the
mishaps
involving
property
damage,
which
become
increasingly
reportable
because
of
the
yard
stick,
which
i
referred.
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
no,
i
would
not
your
honor.
and
may
i
state
my
basis
for
it
(voice
overlap).
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
the
collisions
that
we
are
referring
to
here
your
honor
are
not
primarily
collisions
between
two
trains
moving
in
same
direction
or
even
between
two
trains
moving
--
i
mean
in
opposite
direction
or
two
trains
moving
in
the
same
direction.
the
commission's
classification
of
collisions
also
includes
collisions
from
one
car
raking
the
side
of
the
other.
and
it
includes
and
they
are
reported
as
a
great
many
collisions,
what
happens
when
a
car
goes
over
the
hump
in
the
yard
at
too
greater
speed,
runs
into
another
car
at
the
receiving
track
and
the
classification
yard
and
property
damage
of
$750.00
occurs.
that's
a
collision,
there
may
not
be
an
employee
within
a
great
distance
of
that
event.
so
i
would
have
to
disagree
with
the
statement
that
collisions
inevitably
involve
a
potential
for
casualties,
because
many
of
them
occur
when
there
is
no
potential
for
casualties.
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
it
might
be,
yes
sir,
if
there
were
employees
in
that
area.
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
yes,
if
there
were
employees
in
that
area
--
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
not
the
switching
cars
to
which
i'm
referring,
you're
referring
to
a
train
operating
over
the
line
which
goes
over
an
embankment.
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
the
employees
are
in
the
caboose
and
on
the
head
in.
if
the
derailment
occurs
in
the
middle
of
the
train,
the
employees
maybe
a
long
distance
from
the
point
of
derailment.
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
they
might
be
hurt
in
the
caboose
from
a
sudden
stop,
but
the
likelihood
of
any
injury
in
the
locomotive
would
be
fairly
remote,
with
a
150
car
train
where
one
of
the
middle
cars
derails
and
goes
over
the
embankment.
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
if
there
would
be
a
sudden
stop
in
the
caboose
and
unless
the
men
weren't
properly
braced,
there
might
be
an
injury.
but
the
caboose
itself
would
not
necessarily
go
over
the
embankment
and
--
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
it
might,
that
is
correct
your
honor,
there
could
be
a
casualty
from
that
type
of
an
accident.
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
it
is
possible
for
that
type
of
casualty
to
occur
when
a
caboose
--
when
a
train
stops
suddenly
and
the
occupants
of
the
caboose
are
not
braced
and
they
bounced
around
in
the
caboose
that
does
happen.
but
to
return
just
a
moment,
your
honor,
to
the
collision
--
the
collisions
that
you
inquired
about
earlier,
page
985
of
the
record
--
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
i
would
not
say
that
your
honor.
i
think
an
increase
in
the
number
of
collisions
without
any
explanation
of
why
they
are
increasing
would
be
something
of
the
very
great
significance
in
a
case
of
this
kind.
but
what
i've
tried
to
do
is
to
explain
the
reasons
why
the
reportable
statistics
do
not
pertain
to
anything
of
great
significance
with
respect
to
the
safety
of
individuals.
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
no,
the
standard
to
which
i
refer
is
$750.00
standard
does
not
relate
directly
to
casualty
potential
of
the
collision.
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
i
do
not
understand,
i
don't
believe
there
is
data
there
where
it
shows
collisions
by
states.
now,
there
is
(voice
overlap).
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
the
data
with
respect
to
that
--
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
no,
the
data
that
i'm
familiar
with
in
the
record
does
not
permit
a
comparison
between
arkansas
and
the
rest
of
the
country
in
so
far
as
collisions
are
concerned.
it
does
in
so
far
as
the
entire
category
of
train
accident
is
concerned,
but
i'm
not
aware
of
any
breakdown
with
respect
to
collisions.
but
there
is
a
page
in
the
record
--
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
yes,
that
is
correct
your
honor.
but
the
data
with
respect
to
collisions
does
permit
a
breakdown
between
railroads
operating
with
firemen
and
railroads
operating
without
firemen.
and
at
page
985
of
the
record
there
is
such
a
breakdown.
the
collisions
reportable
reported
since
1961
are
broken
down
at
page
985
of
the
record
into
two
categories:
the
collisions
experienced
by
those
carriers
operating
their
freight
and
yard
services
with
33%
of
the
positions
occupied
by
firemen
and
railroads
operating
their
freight
and
yard
services
with
67%
of
their
service
using
firemen.
and
that
breakdown
with
respect
to
collision
shows
that
from
1964
to
1966,
the
group
operating
predominately
with
firemen
experienced
an
increase
of
31%
in
collisions
by
the
group
operating
predominately
without
firemen
experienced
an
increase
of
17%.
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
that's
freight
and
yard
service,
includes
both
of
them
your
honor.
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
thank
you
your
honor.
and
i
wish
to
refer
particularly
to
a
report
made
by
a
so-called
national
joint
board
with
respect
to
safety
of
operations
following
the
award
of
arbitration
board
number
282.
the
national
joint
board
consisted
of
representatives
of
the
railroads
and
of
the
two
brotherhoods
representing
engine
crew
employees,
the
firemen
and
the
engineers.
and
the
board's
report
discusses
the
safety
of
operations,
which
the
parties
make.
i
emphasized
particularly
that
the
studies
made
by
the
brotherhood
of
locomotive
of
engineers,
which
is
discussed
in
this
report
disclose
that
the
elimination
of
firemen's
jobs
had
not
adversely
affected
safety
of
railroad
operations.
this
report
is
made
in
january
of
1966,
almost
two
years
after
the
effective
date
of
the
arbitration
award.
the
engineers,
i
emphasized,
as
a
remaining
members
of
the
engine
crews
and
freight
in
yard
service
have
a
most
immediate
and
direct
interest
in
safety
of
operations.
when
the
report
in
question
was
made,
the
engineers
have
been
participating
in
such
operations
for
a
period
of
almost
two
years.
and
the
organization
undertook
to
make
it
study
representative
of
railroads
throughout
the
united
states.
the
grand
chief
of
the
brotherhood
relying
on
these
studies
stated
in
a
letter
to
the
chairman
of
the
committee
on
commerce
of
the
united
states
senate
that
the
removal
of
firemen
under
the
award
had
not
aversely
affected
the
safety
of
the
remaining
employees
and
i
am
quoting
"that
engineers
are
now
efficiently
and
safely
moving
their
trains
over
the
road."
i
emphasize
again
that
this
was
a
study
by
the
brotherhood
of
locomotive
engineers
based
on
data
submitted
by
its
members
who
had
been
observing
operations
without
firemen
for
two
years
and
that
study
supports
the
judgment
of
the
district
court.
mr.

under
agreements
made
with
the
brotherhood
of
locomotive
engineers,
there
have
been
wage
increases,
which
were
applicable
to
operations
without
firemen.
in
other
words,
the
first
agreement,
the
only
one
which
i'm
familiar
provided
that
engineers
operating
in
freight
service
without
a
fireman
would
receive
an
additional
of
$1.50
per
day,
that
type
of
agreement
was
made.
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
i
take
it
under
the
authorities,
your
honor,
that
we
do
have
the
burden
of
showing
that
the
safety
benefits
if
any
arising
from
the
statute
are
--
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
i
think
the
discrimination
and
equal
protection
argument
--
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
yes,
the
discrimination
and
equal
protection
arguments
might
still
be
valid
despite
the
finding
with
respect
to
safety.
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
that's
right
your
honor,
the
lower
court
did
not
pass
on
any
of
those
two
points.
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
now,
the
statutes
in
question
your
honor
--
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
the
statutes
in
question
your
honor
apply
with
respect
to
length
of
road
in
the
state
and
switching
operations
for
large
railroad
can
be
precisely
the
same
as
switching
operations
for
a
small
railroad.
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
but
in
switching
operations,
your
honor,
the
longer
trains
would
not
affect
the
movements
of
cars
within
the
switching
yard.
when
the
train
first
comes
into
the
yard
has
broken
up
and
operations
thereafter
are
in
terms
of
cuts
of
cars.
in
fact
in
most
instances
are
the
same
regardless
of
the
size
of
the
train
that
comes
into
the
yard.
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
the
freight
operations
--
the
question
of
whether
the
length
of
line
means
anything
with
respect
to
size
of
crew
your
honor
is
answered
i
believe
in
the
evidence
by
the
fact
that
the
arbitration
award
of
board
number
282
laid
down
a
series
of
guidelines,
which
provided
considerations
to
be
taken
into
account
by
special
boards
in
determining
what
the
size
of
the
crew
should
be
on
particular
runs
or
assignments.
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
the
argument
does
depend
ultimately
on
that,
yes.
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
if
the
--
i
believe
though
there
is
still
a
valid
inquiry
as
to
whether
the
100-mile
limit
and
the
50-mile
limit
is
a
differentiating
circumstances
as
far
safety
is
concerned.
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
even
in
the
freight
area.
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
over
the
road,
a
100-mile
railroad
might
hold
a
150
car
train,
which
is
then
interchanges
with
--
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
the
record
does
contain
a
great
deal
of
evidence
of
the
operation
--
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
it
does,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
there
are
no
findings
on
that
point,
but
there
is
a
great
deal
of
evidence
on
the
record
on
the
operations
of
the
smaller
railroads.
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
yes.
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
if
the
question
turns
on
equal
protection
commerce
and
the
discrimination
against
commerce
points,
i
believe
perhaps
it
should
be
remanded
to
the
lower
court
for
taking
further
evidence
and
for
findings
on
those
issues.
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
there
was
evidence
taken
on
it
your
honor,
we
put
in
a
considerable
amount
of
evidence
on
that
point.
and
if
the
question
were
only
one
of
the
adequacy
of
the
record,
i
don't
believe
it
would
be
necessary
to
remand,
but
mr.
justice
brennan
suggest
the
lack
of
findings
may
require
remand
in
that
respect,
the
findings
i
felt
to
be
essential,
then
perhaps
it
should
be
remanded
for
both
purposes
rather
than
for
just
the
one.
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
presentation
will
deal
primarily
with
the
factual
basis
for
the
lower
court's
determination
at
the
arkansas
statutes,
they're
not
reasonably
related
to
safety.
and
i
will
in
the
course
of
that,
mr.
chief
justice,
discuss
the
collisions
to
which
you
have
referred
and
which
you
asked
mr.
light
about.
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
discuss
a
preliminary
matter
before
getting
to
that
particular
subject.
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
under
safety
issue,
the
district
court
made
several
critical
findings.
it
found
first
that
from
the
overwhelming
weight
of
the
evidence
that
since
the
mid-1950s,
neither
the
firemen
on
the
diesel
locomotive
nor
the
third
brakemen
or
helper
contributed
to
safety
of
railroad
operations.
the
district
court
also
found
without
regard
to
employee
categories
that
trains
have
been
operated
safely
in
other
parts
of
the
united
states
for
many
years,
with
crews
of
less
than
six
men
that
size
required
by
the
arkansas
statute.
and
that
the
training
operations
with
these
small
crews
had
been
conducted
with
safety.
and
finally,
the
district
court
concluded
from
the
evidence
as
a
whole,
under
present
conditions,
continued
enforcement
of
the
statutes
makes
no
significant
contribution
to
railroad
safety.
in
reaching
these
conclusions
and
making
these
findings,
the
district
court
relied
heavily
on
evidence,
have
comparable
and
safe
operations
with
smaller
crews.
in
other
cases
involving
identical
issues,
the
courts
have
relied
on
the
same
type
of
evidence.
in
the
warrenburg
case
which
is
referred
to
and
discussed
in
our
brief,
the
court
relied
on
evidence
of
comparable
and
safe
operations
with
44
ton
yards
switching
diesels
without
a
fireman
and
found
the
ordinance
requiring
a
fireman
on
that
type
of
equipment
to
be
unconstitutional.
in
the
southern
pacific
case
particularly,
this
court
relied
extensively
on
evidence
of
safe
operations
in
states
outside
of
arizona,
operating
three
of
the
70
car
limitation
imposed
by
arizona.
and
it
concluded
on
the
basis
of
such
safe
operations
in
other
states
that
the
arizona
limitation
had
no
reasonable
relation
to
safety.
the
record
in
the
present
case
permits
the
same
type
of
comparison
and
strongly
supports
the
district
court's
conclusion
that
the
statutory
requirements
at
issue
do
not
promote
safety
of
operations.
this
comparative
evaluation
is
greatly
facilitated
by
the
changes
in
crew
size,
which
have
occurred
since
1964
as
a
result
of
the
award
of
arbitration
board
number
282.
that
award
which
was
applicable
to
virtually
every
major
railroad
in
the
united
states
has
resulted
in
the
elimination
of
a
majority
of
the
firemen's
positions
and
a
reduction
in
the
number
of
brakemen
and
helpers
used
on
crews
in
road
and
yard
service.
there's
also
available
for
the
same
period
of
time,
extensive
data
relating
to
safety
of
operations.
this
data
permits
a
comparison
of
the
safety
of
railroad
operations
over
a
period
of
time,
and
it
also
permits
a
geographic
comparison
between
states.
and
when
this
information,
with
respect
to
safety
of
operations
is
properly
related
to
the
change
in
crew
size
which
have
occurred
since
1964,
it
is
possible
to
draw
conclusions
as
to
the
relative
safety
of
operations
with
crews
of
different
sizes
under
comparable
conditions.
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
no,
we
do
not
your
honor.
our
basic
point
is
that
the
extra
men
required
do
not
make
any
contribution
to
safety,
the
operation
is
as
safe
with
the
four-man
crew
as
it
is
with
the
six-man
crew.
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
no,
we
do
not
make
--
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
no,
we
don't
have
that
argument
here,
your
honor.
perhaps
the
most
graphic
of
the
comparisons
which
the
record
permits
involves
the
arkansas
operations
of
the
plaintiff
railroads
in
this
case
and
their
operations
in
other
states.
as
these
railroads
reduced
the
crews
under
the
provisions
of
the
award
of
arbitration
board
number
282,
it
became
and
it
remains
common
place
for
trains
and
through
service
on
this
railroads
to
operate
with
identical
characteristics
through
arkansas
and
adjacent
states,
except
for
differences
in
crew
size,
the
size
of
the
train,
its
motor
power,
the
frequency
or
infrequency
of
stops,
the
characteristics
of
tracks,
signal
protection
and
terrain
remain
incomparable.
only
the
size
of
the
crew
changes
from
the
four-man
crew
in
other
states
to
the
six-man
crew
required
by
the
arkansas
statute.
trains
of
the
frisco
railroad
operating
over
its
main
line
to
missouri,
arkansas,
on
tennessee
undergo
these
crew
changes
as
they
pass
in
to
weiner
of
arkansas.
trains
of
the
rock
island
operating
from
tennessee
to
new
mexico
have
the
same
experience,
going
from
four-man
crews
in
other
states
to
six-man
crews
in
arkansas.
and
the
missouri
pacific
and
cotton
belt
have
a
large
volume
of
interstate
operations,
which
also
proceeds
identical
in
operating
features
and
characteristics,
except
for
differences
in
crew
size.
now,
in
yard
services,
mr.
light
has
pointed
out
there
are
instances
where
a
border
bisects
the
yard
and
where
four-man
crews
do
a
switching
in
one
part
of
the
yard
and
six-man
crew
do
the
switching
on
occasions
when
they
are
required
to
go
into
arkansas.
the
other
part
of
the
record
on
this,
in
addition
to
the
changes
in
crew
size
is
the
evidence
which
shows
the
relative
safety
of
operations
of
the
plaintiff
railroads
in
arkansas
and
in
other
states.
the
record
shows
that
during
the
five-year
period,
which
the
most
recent
five-year
period
available
at
the
time
of
the
trial,
from
1961
to
1966,
casualties
arising
from
train
operations
were
reduced
by
13%
in
arkansas
and
16%
in
other
states
through
which
the
plaintiff
railroads
operate.
i'm
referring
now
to
the
reportable
causalities
comprehended
by
the
regulations
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
casualties
were
reduced
in
both
arkansas
and
in
other
states,
but
the
reduction
in
other
states
on
the
plaintiff
railroad
is
greater
than
in
arkansas.
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
casualities,
the
injuries
to
burden.
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
yes,
accidents
your
honor
are
comprehended
under
the
interstate
commerce
commission
term
of
train
accidents.
a
train
accident
to
be
reportable
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission
must
involve
one
basic
requirement.
it
must
involve
property
damage
to
railroad
equipment
arising
out
of
the
operation
of
trains
of
at
least
$750.00.
since
1961,
there
has
been
a
trend
of
increases
in
train
accidents
reportable
to
the
commission,
and
train
accidents
also
comprehend
collisions.
collisions
are
one
of
the
categories
within
the
train
accident
category.
there
has
been
an
increase
in
train
accidents
reportable
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission
since
1961.
but
the
fact
is
that
casualties,
injuries
to
people
arising
out
of
those
incidents
has
been
declining
since
1961,
so
that
by
1967,
there's
a
25%
reduction
in
the
casualties
or
injuries
to
people
arising
from
these
train
accidents.
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
the
evidence,
your
honor,
shows
that
the
reason
for
this
increase
in
reportable
train
accidents
is
primarily
the
fact
that
the
standard
is
stated
in
terms
of
damage
to
equipment
and
that
one
of
the
features
involved
in
determining
the
damage
to
equipment
is
the
amount
of
cost
involved
in
repairing
the
equipment.
and
this
$750.00
standard,
which
has
remained
inflexible
since
1961,
has
resulted
in
an
increasing
number
of
incidents
falling
within
the
reporting
requirements,
as
equipment
cost
had
increased,
as
labor
cost
have
gone
up,
the
proportion
of
incidences,
in
which
in
this
--
becomes
a
reportable
train
accident
has
also
increase.
so
that
the
basic
point
that
the
record
establishes
in
this
connection,
is
that
in
so
far
as
safety
is
concerned,
in
terms
of
injuries
to
people,
that
there
has
been
improvement
in
that
and
that
there
has
been
at
least
a
comparable
improvement
in
states
which
do
not
require
six-man
crews.
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
that
could
account
for
some
of
them
your
honor,
but
the
fact
is
that
only
a
very
small
number
of
train
accidents
have
a
potential
for
casualties.
the
reported
data
for
1967
shows
approximately
7200
train
accidents.
the
reportable
casualties
for
1967
to
persons
arising
out
of
train
accidents
is
924,
when
--
so
on
its
phase,
the
924
against
the
7000
produces
something
in
the
vicinity
of
10%
of
train
accidents
that
result
in
casualties
of
any
kind.
and
when
the
casualties
in
train
accidents
are
allocated
to
specific
accidents,
so
that
you
take
into
account
the
fact
that
some
produce
two
casualties,
others
do
not
produce
any,
only
6.5%
of
the
train
accidents
involve
casualties.
so,
our
basic
point
is
that
the
discussion
of
train
accidents,
the
emphasis
and
what
has
happened
to
train
accidents,
is
a
concern
with
the
mishaps
involving
property
damage,
which
become
increasingly
reportable
because
of
the
yard
stick,
which
i
referred.
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
no,
i
would
not
your
honor.
and
may
i
state
my
basis
for
it
(voice
overlap).
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
the
collisions
that
we
are
referring
to
here
your
honor
are
not
primarily
collisions
between
two
trains
moving
in
same
direction
or
even
between
two
trains
moving
--
i
mean
in
opposite
direction
or
two
trains
moving
in
the
same
direction.
the
commission's
classification
of
collisions
also
includes
collisions
from
one
car
raking
the
side
of
the
other.
and
it
includes
and
they
are
reported
as
a
great
many
collisions,
what
happens
when
a
car
goes
over
the
hump
in
the
yard
at
too
greater
speed,
runs
into
another
car
at
the
receiving
track
and
the
classification
yard
and
property
damage
of
$750.00
occurs.
that's
a
collision,
there
may
not
be
an
employee
within
a
great
distance
of
that
event.
so
i
would
have
to
disagree
with
the
statement
that
collisions
inevitably
involve
a
potential
for
casualties,
because
many
of
them
occur
when
there
is
no
potential
for
casualties.
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
it
might
be,
yes
sir,
if
there
were
employees
in
that
area.
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
yes,
if
there
were
employees
in
that
area
--
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
not
the
switching
cars
to
which
i'm
referring,
you're
referring
to
a
train
operating
over
the
line
which
goes
over
an
embankment.
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
the
employees
are
in
the
caboose
and
on
the
head
in.
if
the
derailment
occurs
in
the
middle
of
the
train,
the
employees
maybe
a
long
distance
from
the
point
of
derailment.
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
they
might
be
hurt
in
the
caboose
from
a
sudden
stop,
but
the
likelihood
of
any
injury
in
the
locomotive
would
be
fairly
remote,
with
a
150
car
train
where
one
of
the
middle
cars
derails
and
goes
over
the
embankment.
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
if
there
would
be
a
sudden
stop
in
the
caboose
and
unless
the
men
weren't
properly
braced,
there
might
be
an
injury.
but
the
caboose
itself
would
not
necessarily
go
over
the
embankment
and
--
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
it
might,
that
is
correct
your
honor,
there
could
be
a
casualty
from
that
type
of
an
accident.
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
it
is
possible
for
that
type
of
casualty
to
occur
when
a
caboose
--
when
a
train
stops
suddenly
and
the
occupants
of
the
caboose
are
not
braced
and
they
bounced
around
in
the
caboose
that
does
happen.
but
to
return
just
a
moment,
your
honor,
to
the
collision
--
the
collisions
that
you
inquired
about
earlier,
page
985
of
the
record
--
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
i
would
not
say
that
your
honor.
i
think
an
increase
in
the
number
of
collisions
without
any
explanation
of
why
they
are
increasing
would
be
something
of
the
very
great
significance
in
a
case
of
this
kind.
but
what
i've
tried
to
do
is
to
explain
the
reasons
why
the
reportable
statistics
do
not
pertain
to
anything
of
great
significance
with
respect
to
the
safety
of
individuals.
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
no,
the
standard
to
which
i
refer
is
$750.00
standard
does
not
relate
directly
to
casualty
potential
of
the
collision.
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
i
do
not
understand,
i
don't
believe
there
is
data
there
where
it
shows
collisions
by
states.
now,
there
is
(voice
overlap).
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
the
data
with
respect
to
that
--
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
no,
the
data
that
i'm
familiar
with
in
the
record
does
not
permit
a
comparison
between
arkansas
and
the
rest
of
the
country
in
so
far
as
collisions
are
concerned.
it
does
in
so
far
as
the
entire
category
of
train
accident
is
concerned,
but
i'm
not
aware
of
any
breakdown
with
respect
to
collisions.
but
there
is
a
page
in
the
record
--
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
yes,
that
is
correct
your
honor.
but
the
data
with
respect
to
collisions
does
permit
a
breakdown
between
railroads
operating
with
firemen
and
railroads
operating
without
firemen.
and
at
page
985
of
the
record
there
is
such
a
breakdown.
the
collisions
reportable
reported
since
1961
are
broken
down
at
page
985
of
the
record
into
two
categories:
the
collisions
experienced
by
those
carriers
operating
their
freight
and
yard
services
with
33%
of
the
positions
occupied
by
firemen
and
railroads
operating
their
freight
and
yard
services
with
67%
of
their
service
using
firemen.
and
that
breakdown
with
respect
to
collision
shows
that
from
1964
to
1966,
the
group
operating
predominately
with
firemen
experienced
an
increase
of
31%
in
collisions
by
the
group
operating
predominately
without
firemen
experienced
an
increase
of
17%.
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
that's
freight
and
yard
service,
includes
both
of
them
your
honor.
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
thank
you
your
honor.
and
i
wish
to
refer
particularly
to
a
report
made
by
a
so-called
national
joint
board
with
respect
to
safety
of
operations
following
the
award
of
arbitration
board
number
282.
the
national
joint
board
consisted
of
representatives
of
the
railroads
and
of
the
two
brotherhoods
representing
engine
crew
employees,
the
firemen
and
the
engineers.
and
the
board's
report
discusses
the
safety
of
operations,
which
the
parties
make.
i
emphasized
particularly
that
the
studies
made
by
the
brotherhood
of
locomotive
of
engineers,
which
is
discussed
in
this
report
disclose
that
the
elimination
of
firemen's
jobs
had
not
adversely
affected
safety
of
railroad
operations.
this
report
is
made
in
january
of
1966,
almost
two
years
after
the
effective
date
of
the
arbitration
award.
the
engineers,
i
emphasized,
as
a
remaining
members
of
the
engine
crews
and
freight
in
yard
service
have
a
most
immediate
and
direct
interest
in
safety
of
operations.
when
the
report
in
question
was
made,
the
engineers
have
been
participating
in
such
operations
for
a
period
of
almost
two
years.
and
the
organization
undertook
to
make
it
study
representative
of
railroads
throughout
the
united
states.
the
grand
chief
of
the
brotherhood
relying
on
these
studies
stated
in
a
letter
to
the
chairman
of
the
committee
on
commerce
of
the
united
states
senate
that
the
removal
of
firemen
under
the
award
had
not
aversely
affected
the
safety
of
the
remaining
employees
and
i
am
quoting
"that
engineers
are
now
efficiently
and
safely
moving
their
trains
over
the
road."
i
emphasize
again
that
this
was
a
study
by
the
brotherhood
of
locomotive
engineers
based
on
data
submitted
by
its
members
who
had
been
observing
operations
without
firemen
for
two
years
and
that
study
supports
the
judgment
of
the
district
court.
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
under
agreements
made
with
the
brotherhood
of
locomotive
engineers,
there
have
been
wage
increases,
which
were
applicable
to
operations
without
firemen.
in
other
words,
the
first
agreement,
the
only
one
which
i'm
familiar
provided
that
engineers
operating
in
freight
service
without
a
fireman
would
receive
an
additional
of
$1.50
per
day,
that
type
of
agreement
was
made.
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
i
take
it
under
the
authorities,
your
honor,
that
we
do
have
the
burden
of
showing
that
the
safety
benefits
if
any
arising
from
the
statute
are
--
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
i
think
the
discrimination
and
equal
protection
argument
--
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
yes,
the
discrimination
and
equal
protection
arguments
might
still
be
valid
despite
the
finding
with
respect
to
safety.
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
that's
right
your
honor,
the
lower
court
did
not
pass
on
any
of
those
two
points.
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
now,
the
statutes
in
question
your
honor
--
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
the
statutes
in
question
your
honor
apply
with
respect
to
length
of
road
in
the
state
and
switching
operations
for
large
railroad
can
be
precisely
the
same
as
switching
operations
for
a
small
railroad.
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
but
in
switching
operations,
your
honor,
the
longer
trains
would
not
affect
the
movements
of
cars
within
the
switching
yard.
when
the
train
first
comes
into
the
yard
has
broken
up
and
operations
thereafter
are
in
terms
of
cuts
of
cars.
in
fact
in
most
instances
are
the
same
regardless
of
the
size
of
the
train
that
comes
into
the
yard.
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
the
freight
operations
--
the
question
of
whether
the
length
of
line
means
anything
with
respect
to
size
of
crew
your
honor
is
answered
i
believe
in
the
evidence
by
the
fact
that
the
arbitration
award
of
board
number
282
laid
down
a
series
of
guidelines,
which
provided
considerations
to
be
taken
into
account
by
special
boards
in
determining
what
the
size
of
the
crew
should
be
on
particular
runs
or
assignments.
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
the
argument
does
depend
ultimately
on
that,
yes.
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
if
the
--
i
believe
though
there
is
still
a
valid
inquiry
as
to
whether
the
100-mile
limit
and
the
50-mile
limit
is
a
differentiating
circumstances
as
far
safety
is
concerned.
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
even
in
the
freight
area.
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
over
the
road,
a
100-mile
railroad
might
hold
a
150
car
train,
which
is
then
interchanges
with
--
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
the
record
does
contain
a
great
deal
of
evidence
of
the
operation
--
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
it
does,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
there
are
no
findings
on
that
point,
but
there
is
a
great
deal
of
evidence
on
the
record
on
the
operations
of
the
smaller
railroads.
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
yes.
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
if
the
question
turns
on
equal
protection
commerce
and
the
discrimination
against
commerce
points,
i
believe
perhaps
it
should
be
remanded
to
the
lower
court
for
taking
further
evidence
and
for
findings
on
those
issues.
mr.
martin
m.
lucente
there
was
evidence
taken
on
it
your
honor,
we
put
in
a
considerable
amount
of
evidence
on
that
point.
and
if
the
question
were
only
one
of
the
adequacy
of
the
record,
i
don't
believe
it
would
be
necessary
to
remand,
but
mr.
justice
brennan
suggest
the
lack
of
findings
may
require
remand
in
that
respect,
the
findings
i
felt
to
be
essential,
then
perhaps
it
should
be
remanded
for
both
purposes
rather
than
for
just
the
one.
