justice
abe
fortas
well,
do
i
understand
that.
do
i
understand
that
if
you
no
longer
contend
that
the
statute
entitles
you
to
this?
justice
abe
fortas
but
you
have
a
question
as
to
who
is
a
refugee
while
that
he
is
a
refugee
and
what
procedures
have
to
be
followed
to
establish
that
he
belongs
in
that
category,
don't
you?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
and
that
--
does
that
depend
on
the
statute?
as
i
understand
it
that
the
united
states
has
reserved
to
itself
the
right
to
determine
who
is
a
refugee.
then
presumably
in
the
statute
to
the
united
states
has
prescribed
a
procedure
by
which
in
cases
of
this
sort
it
will
make
a
judgment
as
to
who
is
a
refugee.
now,
you're
claiming
one
sort
of
procedure,
your
client
was
given
another
kind
of
procedure
and
i'll
be
interested
to
hear
what
you
have
to
say
about
the
statute
and
what
like
a
statute
sheds
upon
whether
you're
correct
in
your
contention
or
the
government's
correct
in
its
contention
as
to
the
prescribed
procedure,
prescribed
form
of
proceeding.
i
was
interested
in
your
argument,
this
far
you
seem
to
drop
out
with
reference
to
the
statute.
but
perhaps,
it
was
just
a
matter
of
the
order
of
argument.
justice
abe
fortas
you
really
--
you
really
don't
think
that's
a
totally
unfair
category
sanction
that
by
–
it's
true
that
he
was
given
15
minutes
notice?
justice
abe
fortas
when
i
got
--
i
can
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
--
i
can
readily
understand
that
a
lawyer
faced
with
that
might
quickly
find
that
he's
way
over
to
the
united
states
district
court
and
file
a
bill
and
because
lawyers
after
all
under
our
system
are
suppose
to
have
some
time
to
get
that
fair
case
for
their
client
and
you
can't
expect
the
yugoslav
seaman
or
any
layman
to
go
wherein
15
minutes
and
present
the
facts
in
support
of
his
claim
of
religious
or
political
persecution.
justice
abe
fortas
now,
what
--
are
you
saying
that
it
makes
no
difference
whether
there's
a
hearing
before
a
--
the
district
director
or
before
a
hearing
officer?
justice
abe
fortas
i
don't
assume
your
saying
that
mr.
connolly.
justice
abe
fortas
what?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
as
a
very
important
point
of
--
potentially
important
point
at
least
in
my
mind
as
to
whether
this
respondent
or
his
counsel
should
have
presented
some
statement
as
to
the
basis
for
his
claim
of
right
to
stand
this
country
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
and
now
--
but
that
meets
to
what
to
my
mind
is
a
very
powerful
obstacle
when
you
get
this
preemptory
and
unexplained
statement
to
that
he
comes
out
and
he
is
to
come
over
and
have
a
hearing
in
15
minutes.
is
there
any
reason
for
that?
is
there
any
reason
for
saying
15
minutes?
justice
abe
fortas
no,
it
doesn't
and
it
was
the
same
afternoon
that
the
lawyer
went
over
to

united

district
court
to
file
his
papers,
is
that
right?

the

the
same
day
those
two
things
happen.
justice
abe
fortas
doesn't
take
much
imagination
to
understand
what
happened
here
mr.
connolly?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
spoke
sharply
to
you.
i
didn't
mean
to
speak
sharply
to
you
--
justice
abe
fortas
but,
by
any
lawyer
that
this
really
is
a
kind
of
startling
situation.
justice
abe
fortas
you
mean
the
statute.
the
congressional
direction
here
is

danger
as
it

danger
of
physical
persecution
as
it
is
now
claimed
based
upon
the
religious
or
political
persecution.
you
mean
those
are
meaningless
so
far
as
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
is
concern?
justice
abe
fortas
i
thought
the

i
thought
the
service
was
subject

direction

and
required
to
follow
the
congressional
direction,
isn't
it?

isn't

a
claim

right?
doesn't
