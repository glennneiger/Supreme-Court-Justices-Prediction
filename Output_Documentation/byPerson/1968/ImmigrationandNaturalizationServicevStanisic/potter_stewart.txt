ground
of
the
district
director's
action?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
under
a
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
regulation.
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
i
see
and
well,
then
that
was
the
ground
for
the
district
director's
action.
there
was
just
no
showing?
justice
potter
stewart
does
that
appear
that
that
was
his
ground?
justice
potter
stewart
where
was
the
affidavit
for
his
file?
justice
potter
stewart
when
was
the
statute
amended?
justice
potter
stewart
some
months
after
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
that
he
came
ashore.
justice
potter
stewart
really,
are
all
of
these
--
the
substantive
issues
which
his
claim
rises
are
really
not
before
us
at
all,
are
they?
or
isn't
the
only
question
whether
or
not
the
procedures
of
252
(b)
were
available
and
continued
to
be
available
even
though
the
shipped
had
left
the
shores
of
the
united
states
or
whether
after
the
ship
left,
the
government
was
required
to
bring
it
242
proceeding
and
you
were
entitled
242
proceeding
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
isn't
that
the
only
issue?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
isn't
that
the
only
issue
a
--
on
which
we
granted
certiorari
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
and
this
is
the
only
issue
really
presented
here
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
not
the
substance
of
your
client's
claim
appealing
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
may
be?
justice
potter
stewart
so,
it
--
justice
potter
stewart
what
about
--
justice
potter
stewart
is
his
right
is
to
have
clear
communication
to
invoke
the
discretion
of
the
attorney
general?
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
request
was
made
while
the
ship
was
still
in
port
in
united
states,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
what
was
the

of
the
