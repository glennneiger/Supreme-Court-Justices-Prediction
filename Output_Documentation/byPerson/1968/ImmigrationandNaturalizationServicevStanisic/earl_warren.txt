mr.

chief
justice
earl
warren
you
move
that
it'd
be
a
better
for
that
purpose.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well,
motion
is
granted.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
connolly,
what
kind
of
hearing
did
he
demand?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
is
that
the
kind
of
a
hearing
that
would
be
time
consuming?
would
the
--
what
was
the
hearing
that
could
be
given
immediately
or
one
that
would
take
time
to
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
on
that
--
would
it
be
enough
time
so
that
it
would
not
be
possible
to
get
him
back
in
his
own
ship?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
fedde.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
wasn't
--
that
wasn't
the
basis
on
which
we
granted
the
permit
--
the
writ
of
certiorari,
was
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
were
those
facts
--
were
those
facts
raised
before
the
deputy
commissioner
when
he
gave
his
original
hearing?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
were
they
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
was
what
day?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
these
all
in
the
record?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that
is
not
part
of
the
record,
is
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
do
we
find
that
in
the
record?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
page
is
it
in
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
appendix?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
a
real
issue
that
were
decided
there
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
ratified
by
the
senate
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
regardless
of
--
regardless
of
what
happened
during
the
29
days
of
this
ashore
in
relation
to
his
wanting
to
stay?
suppose,
let
me
put
it
this
way,
suppose
instead
of
coming
in
on
the
5th
of
january
as
he
did,
he
came
in
on
the
last
day
or
the
next
to
the
last
day
before
the
ship
was
due
to
leave.
would
you
still
contend
that
they
had
to
have
the
hearing
and
everything
before
the
ship
left?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
don't
either
but
the
--
aren't
we
--
wouldn't
we
then
be
riding
out,
out
of
existence
a
statute
which
says
that
he
can
be
you
sent
back
if
the
ship
is
still
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
so,
if
he
comes
in
the
last
day
or
the
next
to
last
day
and
said,
“i'm
not
going
back
and
i
refuse
to
tell
you
why
but
i'm
not
going
back.”
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
then
the
ship
goes
out.
you
say
that
that
entitles
him
to
stay
here
and
have
the
hearing
that
you
claim
he's
entitled
to
have.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
when
they
say
we'll
give
you
a
hearing.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
he
says,
i
won't
tell
you.
i
won't
take
a
hearing
now.
i
won't
put
on
my
case.
i
won't
tell
you
anything.
isn't
that
what
he
did
in
this
instance?
you
put
on
the
basis
that
he
only
had
15
minutes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
suppose
you've
been
thinking
about
this
before
i
knew
why
he
didn't
want
to
go
back?
couldn't
he
at
least
have
stated
to
the
officer
at
that
time
why
he
didn't
want
to
go
back?
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
the
record
show
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
read
the
early
part
of
it
here.
i
don't
find
that,
maybe
there?
i
thought
he
refuse
to
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
no.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
--
yes.
i'm
going
to
give
you
five
minute
or
mr.
fedde,
i'm
going
to
give
you
five
minutes
more
because
i
want
to
give
the
government
five
minutes
more
to
answer
some
questions
too.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
connolly.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
connolly,
what
effect
did
the
protocol
have
on
this
statute
if
any?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
as
i
understood
mr.
fedde
the
--
he
thought
the
protocol
prevented
the
government
now
from
sending
a
man
back
under
this
252
to
be
--
before
the
ship
left?
chief
justice
earl
warren
uh-huh.
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see.
mr.
fedde,
mr.
justice
black

like
to
ask
you
a
question
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
--
you
may
have
just
a
moment
if
you
wish
to
have
something
to
say.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
fedde,
in
this
case
the
