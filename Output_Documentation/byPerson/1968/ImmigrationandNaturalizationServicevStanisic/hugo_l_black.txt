justice
hugo
l.
black
what
does
that
require
you
to
argue
the
constitutionality
if
the
protocol
controls
that
issue?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
talking
about
without
it.
you
--
assuming
you
have
it.
if
you
say
its
controlling,
why
do
you
have
to
go
to
any
constitutional
right?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
have
to
go
on
abundance
of
caution
and
raise
the
constitutional
point
if
you
have
to
decide
it
by
protocol
which
you
say
is
controlling?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
do
we
know
what
they
meant
by
due
process
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
a
challenge
to
the
finding,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
that's
a
different
question
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
challenging
the
finding?
justice
hugo
l.
black
basically,
do
you
stand
on
what
the
court
held
and
when
the
ships
are
gone,
they're
entitled
to
a
hearing?
justice
hugo
l.
black
two
forty
what
is
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
your
basic?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
the
ship
known
then
or
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose,
it
be
true
that
he
did
say,
“i
intend
to
go
back
with
the
ship.”
he
state
here,
you
have
some
proceeding
and
the
ship
left.
his
lawyer
then
came
to
the
immigration
department
and
says,
now,
i
have
--
i'll
be
persecuted
so
i
go
back.
i
want
a
hearing.
would
he
then
have
been
entitled
to
a
hearing
on
the
ground
that
his
ship
had
gone?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i
understood
the
lawyer
to
say
that
he
did
go
on
and
tell
him
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
the
ship
had
already
gone?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understood
him
to
say
that.
there's
a
record
not
to
show
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
the
lawyer
who
presented
the
fact
to
him?
i
understood
him
to
say
that
the
lawyer
after
the
ship
had
gone
presented
that
to
him
and
told
him
the
facts
that
he
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
that
had
been
done?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
would
have
been
in
a
different
act
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
and
it
all
depends
that
point
depends
on
whether
the
lawyer
did
take
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understood
you'd
say
the
lawyer
did,
maybe
i'm
wrong.
did
you
understand
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
i
want
to
ask
you
about
was
this.
i
understood
you
say
that
after
the
boat
left.
do
you
or
some
other
lawyer
for
the
respondent
went
to
the
immigration
department
and
told
him
that
you
did
have
this
bona
fide
claim
and
asked
for
a
hearing,
was
