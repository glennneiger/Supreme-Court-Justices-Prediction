justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
connolly,
what
was
the
basis
of
respondent's
claim
to
the
right
--
to
a
different
proceeding
than
that
under
the
regulation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
the
ship
still
in
port
at
that
time?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
mr.
connolly,
if
he
had
not
had
a
permit
for
the
jumped
ship
and
his
ship
was
still
in
the
harbor
when
they
picked
him
up.
in
that
circumstance,
if
he
had
made
this
persecution
claim.
would
he
been
entitled
to
a
hearing
before
a
hearing
examiner
rather
than
before
the
district
director?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that
getting
the
permit,
he
gets
only
the
summary
hearing
on
persecution
plan
but
if
he
hadn't
got
the
permit
and
jumped
ship,
he
didn't
have
the
hearing
before
the
hearing
december,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
are
you
arguing
on
the
basis
of
the
protocol
that
whatever
the
statute
may
originally
have
required
or
permitted,
this
case
has
to
be
determined
now
within
the
four
corners
of
the
protocol?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don't
follow
this.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
told
us
that
the
protocol
no
longer
permits
deportation
to
the
country
of
origin
in
the
case
political
refugee.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
refugee
whatever
it
may
be.
then
i
don't
understand.
if
that's
so,
then
what
relevance
has
statute
any
longer?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
suppose
he
is.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
suppose
he
gets
it
and
suppose
that's
concluded
that
the
he
is
deportable
then
what
happens
to
him?
what
controls
then,
the
protocol?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so,
he
could
not
be
deported
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yugoslavia.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
have
five
minutes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
another
way
of
looking
at
it
is
a
person
off
a
ship
from
yugoslavia
coming
to
a
strange
country
worked
up
pretty
well
to
get
even
to
the
place
where
he
might
get
justice
to
think
of
an
american
landing
in
yugoslavia
and
trying
to
work
his
way
through
all
the
nuisances
of
yugoslavia
law.
i
don't
get
this
argument
at
all?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
assumed
that
every
person
who
walks
in
has
an
llb
from
harvard.
he
got
a's
in
all
of
his
courses.
he
knows
all
of
the
intricacies
of
all
these
sections.
