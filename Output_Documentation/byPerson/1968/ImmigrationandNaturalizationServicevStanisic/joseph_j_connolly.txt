mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
thank
you
mr.
solicitor
general.
if
it
please
the
court,
this
case
arises
under
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
of
1952.
the
case
is
here
in
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
to
review
that
court's
interpretation
of
the
act's
provisions
governing
the
temporary
landing
of
alien
crewman
for
shore
leave
while
their
vessels
call
at
united
states
ports.
before
setting
forth
the
facts
of
this
case,
i
would
like
briefly
to
outline
the
statutory
provisions
which
this
case
involves.
in
parts
iv
and
v
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
act,
congress
set
out
the
basic
provisions
that
establishing
the
procedures
and
the
standards
for
the
admission
and
expulsion
of
aliens
into
and
from
the
united
states.
in
part
iv
dealing
with
admissions,
congress
provided
that
if
an
alien
presenting
himself
at
the
court
of
entry
of
the
united
states
is
denied
admission
by
an
immigration
officer.
the
alien
has
a
right
to
a
hearing
before
a
special
inquiry
officer
or
his
admissibility
and
if
he
is
stand
to
be
inadmissible.
he
may
appeal
to
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
and
from
a
finding
in
the
board
that
he
is
inadmissible,
he
may
obtain
judicial
review
by
habeas
corpus.
section
241
of
the
act,
sets
out
the
grounds
in
which
an
alien
may
be
expelled
from
the
united
states
or
deported
and
under
242
(b)
of
the
act,
when
it
is
alleged
that
an
alien
is
deportable
from
the
united
states.
he
has
the
right
to
a
hearing
before
a
special
inquiry
officer
in
which
he
may
be
represented
by
counsel.
they
present
evidence
and
has
the
right
to
cross-examine
witnesses
against
him.
sections
242
and
243
and
the
following
sections
also
provide
for
certain
forms
of
discretionary
relief
from
expulsion
or
deportation.
what
are
these
forms
of
discretionary
relief
is
under
section
243
(h)
of
the
act
which
authorizes
the
attorney
general
in
his
discretion
to
withhold
the
deportation
of
any
alien
to
any
country
in
which
his
opinion,
the
alien
may
be
subjected
to
persecution
of
an
grounds
of
race,
religion,
or
political
opinion.
under
the
regulations
issued
by
the
attorney
general
that
determination
under
section
243
(h)
is
initially
made
by
the
special
inquiry
officer
who
conducts
the
deportation
of
proceeding
under
section
242.
in
part
vi
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
act,
congress
establish
special
procedures
for
the
admission
and
in
some
cases
for
the
expulsion
of
alien
crewman.
under
section
242
(a)
of
the
act
which
is
the
exclusive
procedure
for
the
temporary
admission
of
alien
crewman,
congress
provided
that
an
immigration
officer
may
in
his
discretion
issue
a
temporary
permit
for
the
alien
crewman
to
land.
if
he
finds
that
the
alien
is
a
bona
fide
crewman
and
if
he
finds
under
subsection
(a)
(1)
of
252
that
the
alien
intends
to
depart
on
the
vessel
in
which
he
arrives,
and
the
permit
issued
under
subsection
(a)
(1)
is
good
for
the
period
during
which
the
alien
crewman's
vessel
is
in
port.
the
section
further
provides
that
the
alien
crewman
must
agree
to
accept
such
a
permit
which
is
conditioned
upon
his
being
deported
from
the
united
states
as
provided
in
subsection
(b)
of
the
statute.
that
section,
subsection
(b)
provides
that
if
an
immigration
officer
determines
that
the
alien
no
longer
intends
to
depart
on
the
vessel
on
which
he
arrived.
the
alien
--
the
immigration
officer
may
take
out
and
revoke
the
permit,
take
the
crewman
into
custody
and
if
practicable
remove
him
to
the
vessel
in
which
he
arrived
from
removal
from
the
united
states
on
board
that
vessel.
the
act
provides
it
the
alien
whom
and
shall
be
deported
from
the
united
states,
the
expense
of
the
transportation
line
which
brought
him.
the
last
section
of
section
252
(b)
is
particularly
important
in
this
case.
it
provides
that
nothing
in
this
section
shall
be
construed
to
require
the
procedure
prescribed
in
section
242
of
the
act,
the
hearing
before
a
special
inquiry
officer
to
cases
falling
within
the
provisions
of
this
subsection
section
252
(a)
in
the
set
out
on
page
41
and
42
of
the
government's
brief.
regulations
issued
by
the
attorney
general
dealing
with
alien
crewman
also
provide
for
a
--
the
parole
of
an
alien
crewman
who
alleges
that
he
may
be
persecuted
if
he
is
returned
to
his
homeland.
thus,
reflecting
the
discretionary
relief
available
under
section
243
(h)
of
the
act.
now
in
this
case,
respondent,
a
native
and
citizen
of
yugoslavia
arrived
in
this
country
shortly
before
christmas
in
1964
as
a
member
of
a
crew,
the
radio
officer
of
a
yugoslavian
vessel.
he
was
issued
to
conditional
landing
permit
under
section
252
(a)
of
the
act.
good
for
the
time
that
his
vessel
would
remain
in
the
port
in
oregon
and
on
condition
that
respondent
leave
the
united
states
with
his
ship.
he
went
ashore
in
january
4,
1965
and
he
went
directly
to
the
home
of
a
cousin
in
the
company
of
another
crewman
on
board
that
ship.
and
a
day
later
they
both
returned
to
the
immigration
office
in
portland,
oregon
i
believe
and
claimed
that
they've
claim
this
--
sought
asylum
in
the
united
states
on
the
grant
that
they
would
be
persecuted
if
they
were
return
to
yugoslavia.
when
representations
which
respondent
made
to
the
immigration
officer
at
that
time
that
he
would
not
under
any
circumstances
return
to
his
ship.
his
conditional
landing
permit
was
revoked
and
he
was
detained
at
the
office.
on
the
following
day
the
district
director
gave
respondent
an
opportunity
to
present
a
statement
and
evidence
in
support
of
his
claim
that
he
would
be
persecuted
if
he
were
return
to
yugoslavia.
this
was
under
the
regulation
which
is
set
out
its
regulation
253.1
(f)
now
and
it
is
set
out
on
page
46
of
the
government's
brief.
upon
advice
of
counsel,
respondent
refuse
to
give
any
evidence
or
make
any
statement
in
support
of
his
claim.
he
contended
that
he
had
a
right
to
a
hearing
before
a
special
inquiry
officer
under
242
(b)
on
his
claim
of
anticipated
persecution
under
243
(h)
and
he
said
that
he
wouldn't
give
any
evidence
to
the
district
director
at
that
time.
consequently,
the
district
director
without
any
evidence
in
support
of
the
claim
denied
the
application
for
parole
and
ordered
that
the
respondent
be
removed
to
a
ship.
respondent
then
brought
suit
in
the
district
court
and
bargained
to
enjoin
the
district
director
from
removing
him
to
his
ship.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
the
ground
that
the
district
director's
action
in
denying
parole?
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
under
the
regulation?
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
there
was
no
evidence
at
all
mr.
justice,
respondent
refused
to
give
any
evidence
claiming
that
he
had
a
right
to
a
different
procedure.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
there
was
no
showing.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
yes.
his
memorandum
of
january
7
is
set
out
in
the
appendix
on
page
5.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
well,
mr.
justice
it
doesn't
really
appear
from
the
record
exactly
what
the
basis
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
the
ship
was
still
in
port
at
that
time.
the
ship
was
still
in
port
at
the
time
at
that
he
claimed
asylum
in
the
united
states.
he
was
still
in
port
at
the
time
that
his
landing
privilege
was
revoked.
he
was
still
in
port
in
the
following
day
when
he
refused
to
get
any
evidence
in
support
of
his
claim.
i
will
touch
upon
that
issue
in
just
second
because
it
--
in
order
to
refine
the
issue
before
the
court
which
is
not
to
give
--
assure
the
nature
of
the
claim
to
the
hearing
under
242
(b).
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
he
demanded
a
hearing
before
a
special
inquiry
officer
pursuant
to
section
242
(b)
which
is
set
out
in
the
government's
brief
on
pages
39
and
40.
that's
what
he
claimed
he
said
that
under
243
(h)
which
authorize
the
discretionary
relief
he
had
the
right
to
a
hearing
under
242
(b).
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
the
record
doesn't
disclose
mr.
justice
whether
there
were
any
special
inquiry
officers,
mr.
chief
justice,
whether
there
were
any
special
inquiry
officers
in
oregon
at
the
time.
it
doesn't
disclose
exactly
what
the
nature
the
evidence
that
he
intended
to
present.
we
can
assume
that
it
would
be
somewhat
of
a
time
consuming
procedure.
how
long
i
just
can't
estimate.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
conceivably
it
would
be.
the
supplement
--
the
government
provide
that
the
record
shows
that
he
ship
sailed
from
oregon
sometime
after
the
7th
and
sailed
from
somewhere
in
california
for
italy
around
the
16th.
so,
we
just
really
don't
know
whether
it
would
have
been
possible
to
hold
such
a
hearing.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
my
understanding,
mr.
justice
would
be
that
under
the
act,
he
would
not
be
subject
to
section
252
(b)
but
that
he
must
be
preceded
against
under
section
2
--
on
the
grounds
stated
in
241
and
under
the
proceeding
in
section
242
(b).
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
that
is
right
mr.
justice
and
i
intend
to
deal
with
that
question
later
on
as
to
whether
the
discrimination
between
a
crewman
who
gets
a
permit
and
a
crewman
who
jumped
ship
makes
any
sense
at
all.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
that
is
right
mr.
justice
and
i
also
intend
to
deal
with
that
form
of
discrimination.
to
continue
on
with
the
facts,
after
the
district
director
denied
his
claim
for
parole,
he
sued
to
enjoin
the
district
director
from
removing
him
to
his
ship.
the
district
court
and
claim
to
that
time
also
that
he
had
to
write
to
a
hearing
before
a
special
inquiry
officer.
the
district
court
denied
his
claim
that
he
had
a
right
to
a
hearing
before
a
special
inquiry
officer
but
remanded
the
case
back
to
the
district
director
for
the
taking
of
evidence,
an
opportunity
which
respondent
accepted
at
this
time
and
presented
his
evidence.
when
the
evidence
presented,
the
district
director
found
that
there
was
insufficient,
the
showing
of
a
sufficient
likelihood
of
the
persecution
to
justify
granting
the
parole
of
the
discretionary
relief.
and
ordered
--
and
denied
the
application
again.
on
review,
the
district
court
found
that
the
district
director's
determination
was
not
an
abuse
of
discretion
and
agreed
with
the
district
director
that
there
had
been
a
showing
made
of
any
sufficient
likelihood
of
persecution.
respondent
did
not
appeal
that
determination
by
the
district
court
instead
he
sought
relief
by
private
bill
in
congress
when
that
bill
was
adversely
acted
upon
in
the
following
year
in
1966,
he
again
petition
for
parole
for
withholding
a
deportation
administratively.
again,
claiming
a
hearing
under
section
242,
that
relief
was
denied
by
the
district
director
on
the
ground
that
the
prior
proceeding
was
a
fully
adequate
hearing
and
that
the
determination
had
been
made
adversely
to
respond.
he
sued
again
in
the
district
court
to
enjoin
the
district
director
from
deporting
him.
the
district
court
found
that
the
prior
proceedings
were
fully
adequate,
denied
the
relief.
on
appeal
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit,
the
court
held
that
in
view
of
the
fact
that
respondent's
ship
had
sailed
during
the
pendency
of
the
administrative
proceedings
on
his
claim
of
anticipated
persecution
that
the
revocation
of
the
condition
of
landing
permit
under
section
252
(b)
was
no
longer
proper
basis
for
the
deportation
of
respondent.
the
court
held
that
unless
in
effect
that
unless
the
res
--
that
the
alien
crewman
is
in
fact
removed
on
his
ship.
the
revocation
or
the
expulsion
proceedings
under
section
252
plus
the
board
and
the
alien
crewman
is
entitled
in
all
matters
with
respect
to
the
revocation
and
in
all
matters
of
discretionary
relief
to
a
hearing
under
section
242
(b).
we
disagree
with
the
holding
of
the
district
--
the
holding
of
the
court
of
appeals.
we
believe
that
so
long
as
the
alien
crewman's
conditional
landing
permit
is
revoke
during
the
time
that
is
in
effect,
that
is
during
the
time
with
the
alien
ship
is
still
in
port,
that
it
presents
a
fully
adequate
basis
for
removal
of
the
crewman
from
the
united
states
at
determination
of
any
administrative
or
judicial
proceedings
that
he
might
invoke
on
the
question
of
his
deportability
or
the
question
of
any
discretionary
relief.
and
mr.
justice
brennan
asked
the
question
earlier,
what
was
the
basis
of
his
prior
claim
that
he
had
a
right
to
a
hearing
under
section
242
(b)?
we
really
don't
know.
we
assume
that
by
the
respondent's
position
in
this
court
in
defending
the
judgment
of
court
of
appeals
is
that
he
has
the
right
to
a
hearing
before
a
special
inquiry
officer
under
242
(b)
because
that's
the
way
such
claims
are
handled
in
regular
242
(b)
proceedings
which
the
court
of
appeals
held
he
now
has
a
right
too.
i
have
been
unable
to
find
any
basis
upon
which
it
could
be
inferred
merely
from
section
243
(h)
itself
that
it
is
a
right
to
a
hearing
before
a
special
inquiry
officer.
it
would
seem
that
the
court
of
appeals
took
the
only
statutory
approach
that
can
be
made
in
this
case
and
that
is
to
find
the
right
to
a
hearing
before
a
special
inquiry
officer,
in
the
right
to
a
hearing
before
a
special
inquiry
officer
on
all
claims
and
all
grounds
of
deportation
in
this
case.
we
begin
our
consideration
of
the
statutory
issue
in
this
case.
he
responded
also
raise
his
constitutional
claim,
the
statutory
issue
with
the
hypothetical.
suppose
an
alien
crewman
is
issued
a
conditional
landing
permit
under
section
252
(a),
good
for
the
time
that
his
ship
is
to
remain
in
port.
immediately
leaves
his
ship
and
goes
several
hundred
miles
inland
where
he
obtains
employment
and
a
training
program
of
a
manufacturing
plant
and
enters
into
a
long
term
lease,
a
year's
lease
on
an
apartment.
during
the
time
that
his
ship
is
still
in
port,
he
is
found
by
an
immigration
officer
and
on
the
evidence
of
his
conduct
his
landing
permit
is
revoked.
he
is
brought
back
to
the
port
city
and
without
objection
placed
to
aboard
his
ship
which
sails
the
next
day
for
foreign
port.
now,
as
our
search
reveals
that
all
courts
which
have
considered
the
question
of
interpreting
section
252
(a)
and
(d)
including
the
court
below
in
the
instant
case
would
agree
that
the
immigration
officer
in
that
case
acted
properly.
but
the
difficulty
is
of
course,
that
in
the
hypothetical
which
we
presented,
the
alien's
voluntary
departure
from
this
country.
well,
voluntary
in
the
sense
that
uncontested
departure
moots
any
challenge
to
the
conduct
of
the
immigration
officer.
now,
we
don't
believe
that
congress
enact
its
section
252
merely
to
provide
a
basis
for
or
direction
for
conduct
by
an
immigration
officer
in
a
situation
that
it
couldn't
be
challenge
in
court.
we
believe
that
congress
envision
that
alien
crewman
would
exercise
their
rights
for
admini
--
for
judicial
review
certainly
of
the
conduct
of
immigration
officers
under
the
statute
and
congress
presumably
recognized
that
in
those
case,
it
is
unlikely
to
be
alien's
ship
would
wait
for
him
until
the
expiration
--
until
the
judicial
proceedings
were
terminated.
the
respondent
adopts
the
reasoning
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
approaches
the
problem
from
the
other
side.
they
say
--
the
respondent
says,
well,
the
section
252
(b)
procedure
did
not
apply
to
the
case
where
an
alien
crewman
is
jumps
--
where
an
alien
jumps
his
ship
and
enters
the
united
states
without
a
permit.
under
the
case
where
he
gets
a
permit
to
ship
out
in
another
ship,
where
a
case
in
which
his
permit
is
not
revoked
while
his
ship
is
still
in
port
but
he
stays
on
longer
than
that
and
they
say
it,
well,
since
the
statute
is
thus
narrowly
designed.
it
ought
to
be
construed
more
strictly
to
apply
only
in
the
case
where
the
alien
is
in
fact
deported
on
his
ship.
now,
we
disagree
with
that
proposition.
we
admit
that
from
the
face
of
the
statute,
congress
apparently
contemplated
that
the
alien
crewman
ship
would
be
one
of,
if
not
the
primary.
it
means,
for
removing
him
from
the
united
states
but
if
congress
had
wanted
that
to
be
the
sole
basis,
the
sole
means
for
removing
him
from
the
united
states.
if
congress
wanted
to
limit
the
statute
only
the
situations,
and
where
the
alien
is
in
fact
removed
on
a
ship,
it
could
have
done
so.
we
believe
that
it
begs
the
question
in
this
case,
to
say
as
the
court
of
appeals
did.
that
the
necessity
--
the
justification
for
proper
removal.
the
justification
for
quick
resolution
departs
with
the
vessel.
that
assumes
the
congress
contemplated
only
that
alien
crewman
would
be
deported
on
their
ships.
we
don't
believe
that
that
was
a
contemplation
at
all.
they
determined
when
the
basis
--
the
congress
determined
on
the
basis
of
evidence
that
there
was
a
severe
problem
of
alien
crewman
deserting
their
ships.
that
it
--
there
would
be
a
special
class
of
alien
crewman
who
would
be
granted
conditional
landing
permits
only
on
their
agreement
to
depart
with
their
ship
and
then
if
they
fail
to
that
agreement
during
the
time
their
ships
were
still
in
port,
they
were
immediately
deportable
whether
on
their
ships,
whether
on
another
ship
with
the
same
line
or
whether
after
the
determination
of
any
administrative
or
judicial
proceedings.
now
a
question
has
been
raised,
well
--
could
congress
rationally
have
made
this
determination?
when
it
exempted
from
such
procedures
the
crewman
who
jumped
their
ships
or
crewmen
who
were
admitted
to
ship
out
in
another
vessel,
although,
the
legislative
history
doesn't
provide
any
guidance
on
this
question.
we
believe
that
congress
rationally
would
have
made
such
a
determination.
the
alien
crewman
who
jumps
his
ship
and
enters
without
a
permit
at
all,
where
the
alien
crewman
who
overstays
his
conditional
landing
permit
without
it
being
revoked
may
be
found
10
days,
3
months,
or
10
years
later,
and
the
10
years
later
issue
is
one
that
i
think
that
provides
a
basis
for
distinction
between
the
two
cases
because
unlike
an
alien
who
may
have
been
in
this
country
for
10
years,
albeit
illegally.
and
it
established
family
relationships
and
other
relationships
which
presents
some
equities
in
this
case.
the
alien
crewman
whose
conditional
landing
permit
is
revoked
under
section
252
(b)
has
been
here
at
the
most
for
less
than
29
days,
at
the
most
for
the
time
that
the
ship
has
been
in
ports.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
suppose
he
stayed
two
months?
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
well,
i
think
that
the
argument
that
i'm
making
does
not
require
that
you
draw
the
lines
between
two
months
and
three
months,
three
months
and
four
months
without
this
--
the
--
without
in
effect
the
statutory
limitations
period
of
section
252
(b).
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
no,
because
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
no,
sir.
if
he's
here
for
two
months
or
10
years,
he
gets
a
proceeding
under
section
242
(b).
if
he's
here
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
it's
the
same
thing
mr.
justice
because
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
--
because
we
can't
impose
any
other
statutory
limitations
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
that
is
right.
and
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
yes,
sir.
i
do.
now,
i'd
like
to
turn
in
very
little
time
that
i
have
left
to
respondent's
challenge
that
the
statute
is
interpreted
by
the
united
states,
violates
his
right
to
due
process
under
the
fifth
amendment
and
also
the
government's
obligations
under
the
protocol
relating
to
the
statute
as
the
status
of
refugees.
i
think
that
both
of
these
--
both
claims
can
be
comprise
to
do
a
single
federal
due
process
claim.
the
protocol
incorporates
by
a
reference,
certain
provisions
of
an
international
convention
on
the
same
subject
and
respondent
in
amicus
cite
certain
provisions
of
that
convention
which
relate
to
the
expulsion
of
refugees
on
the
assumption
that
respondent
is
a
refugee.
but
the
accepted
international
construction
of
the
convention
as
the
state
department
advised
the
senate
when
it
was
considering
the
protocol.
is
that
each
of
the
contracting
states
reserves
the
right
to
interpret
the
convention
to
make
the
determination
whether
an
individual
is
a
refugee
and
in
this
case
after
a
hearing
in
which
he
was
entitled
to
present
which
he
did
present
evidence
and
was
represented
by
counsel,
the
district
director
found
that
the
respondent
was
not
a
refugee.
now,
on
respondent's
federal
due
process
claim,
we
note
first
that
respondent
is
not
here
and
has
not
as
far
as
we
know
at
any
time
during
these
proceedings
challenge
the
revocation
of
this
conditional
landing
permit
has
been
anything
other
than
a
fully
adequate
constitutional
basis
for
his
removal
from
the
united
states.
nor
does
he
challenge
--
nor
does
he
contend
that
the
revocation
of
his
conditional
landing
permit
was
arbitrary.
it
hardly
can
be
contended
in
light
of
his
representations
to
the
immigration
officer
that
it
was
arbitrary
in
this
case.
we
ca
--
respondent's
request
for
asylum
therefore
was
a
request
of
an
alien
who
is
deportability
had
been
properly
determined
in
a
proceeding
in
unchallenged
proceeding.
furthermore,
it
was
a
request
for
discretionary
relief
in
case
somewhat
analogies
to
the
situation
before
the
court
in
jay
versus
boyd
in
351
u.s.
and
a
case
in
which
respondent
had
the
burden
of
showing
that
in
his
case,
he
will
be
subject
to
persecution.
as
i
said
before,
he
was
given
a
hearing
before
a
--
the
deputy
district
director
of
the
immigration
service
in
which
he
was
represented
by
counsel.
he
was
permitted
to
present
--
it
testified
himself
and
presented
two
other
witnesses.
and
the
district
director
found
that
there
was
not
showing
--
sufficient
showing
of
person
--
a
likelihood
of
persecution
and
that
finding
was
upheld
by
the
district
court.
so
the
only
difference
between
the
procedure
which
respondent
received
in
this
case
and
the
procedure
which
he
would
have
receive
under
section
242
(b)
under
a
243
(h)
claim
is
that
the
determination
was
made
by
the
district
director
rather
than
the
special
inquiry
officer.
so
the
question
is
in
the
case
of
an
admittedly
deportable
alien
seeking
discretionary
relief
from
the
ground
of
anticipated
persecution
whether
it
is
consistent
with
due
process,
to
have
that
discretion
exercise
by
the
district
director
rather
than
the
special
inquiry
officer.
and
we
do
not
believe
that
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case
fundamental
fairness
required
that
in
the
case
in
which
all
other
contentions
where
to
be
adjudicated
by
the
district
director
that
it
was
necessary
constitutionally
to
some
and
special
inquiry
officer
to
determine
this
claim.
i'd
like
to
reserve
what
time
is
remaining
for
rebuttal.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
mr.
chief
justice,
the
chief
justice
was
very
kind
in
extending
the
government's
time
in
which
improvidently
was
terminated
its
opening
statement
because
there's
a
matters
of
some
importance,
some
very
great
importance
in
this
case
in
which
the
government
and
the
respondent
strongly
disagree.
the
first
place
the
respondent
has
--
respondent's
counsel
has
painted
the
picture
of
an
individual
who
in
good
conscience
after
coming
ashore
rather
than
trying
to
fade
into
the
population
presents
himself
in
the
immigration
office
to
claim
the
asylum
under
the
statute.
i
would
like
to
call
--
to
invite
the
court's
attention
to
respondent's
testimony
before
the
deputy
district
director
on
remand
from
the
district
court
to
pages
12,
14,
20
to
22,
29,
and
30
of
his
testimony
which
is
in
the
record
in
the
court
filed
in
the
little
manila
folder.
it
is
not
printed.
it
is
the
government's
position
that
that
testimony
gives
persuasive
evidence
that
respondent
entertained
the
idea
and
the
intention
well
before
he
came
into
oregon
this
time
to
desert
his
ship
and
to
remain
permanently
in
the
united
states.
at
the
time
that
he
came
to
oregon,
he
obtained
the
conditional
landing
permit
from
an
immigration
officer
on
his
agreement
to
return
with
his
ship,
in
his
representation
to
the
immigration
officer
that
he
was
going
to
return
with
ship
and
then
he
was
not
going
to
desert
a
ship.
i
think
the
best
thing
that
you
can
say
on
the
basis
of
this
evidence
is
that
the
position
that
respondent
finds
himself
now
is
to
scheme
that
was
initially
conceived
in
this
representation.
if
he
had
told
--
if
he
had
been
honest
with
the
immigration
officer
and
told
him
that
he
is
claiming
political
asylum
because
of
anticipated
persecution.
he
clearly
would
not
have
been
entitled
to
a
temporary
landing
permit
under
section
252.
he
would
been
given
a
hearing
under
the
regulations
as
to
whether
he
may
be
paroled
in
the
united
states
but
in
such
a
case
that
determination
would
be
made
by
the
district
director
as
it
was
actually
in
the
present
case
then
he
would
have
no
colorable
claim
to
a
hearing
before
special
inquiry
officer.
so,
in
the
basis
of
initial
misrepresentation
he
is
permitted
his
status
into
a
situation
where
he
is
just
completely
made
a
shambles
of
the
whole
statutory
scheme.
and
the
next
point
that
i'd
like
to
bring
out
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
the
argument
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
well,
i
think
after
mr.
stanisic
got
on
shore
he
did
miraculously
well
against
what
congress
direct
from
the
statute.
the
only
point
that
i'm
trying
to
--
the
essential
point
that
i'm
trying
to
make
is
that
he
was
asked
one
question
by
the
immigration
officer
when
the
immigration
officer
came
aboard
a
ship
and
that
is,
“do
you
intend
to
depart
with
your
ship?”
and
he
said,
“yes.”
and
that's
how
he
got
a
conditional
landing
permit
and
the
evidence
in
the
record,
we
believe,
discloses
that
he
didn't
intend
to
depart
with
the
ship.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
the
matter
of
what
he
said
is
that
he
is
--
he
delayed
--
he
say
--
delayed
getting
married
and
jumping
ship
until
he
could
get
to
the
united
states
because
he
saw
that
--
he
have
been
in
the
united
states
six
times
and
he
delayed
jumping
ship
until
he
got
to
oregon
because
he
had
a
cousin
in
oregon
that
could
help
him.
so,
this
was
in
any
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
he
would
have
been
entitled
to
a
hearing
under
section
242
and
because
of
the
narrowness
of
section
252
that
it
would
have
been
no
exemption
from
that
hearing
requirement.
he
would
have
gotten
the
242
hearing.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
he
did
--
yes.
he
did
go
and
tell
the
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
no,
sir.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
the
record
we
believe
is
supplemented
by
the
government
shows
that
at
the
time
that
he
presented
himself
to
the
immigration
officer
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
no,
sir.
that
is
not
what
happened
in
this
case.
the
ship
was
here
when
he
presented
himself
to
the
immigration
officer.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
if
--
under
the
stature
mr.
justice,
unless
the
landing
permit
is
revoked
while
the
ship
is
in
port.
unless
you
get
a
hold
of
the
alien
and
revoke
his
permit
while
the
ship
in
port.
he
must
be
proceeded
against
under
the
full
procedures.
so,
we
would
have
had
this
case
at
the
ship
had
been
in
port
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
that's
right.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
well,
no
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
no,
sir.
i
didn't
get
it.
now,
the
next
day
and
i
think
more
important
point
that
i'd
like
to
make
is
that
respondent
relies
quite
heavily
on
the
statement
of
the
brief
of
the
amicus
american
civil
liberties
union
to
the
effect
that
the
hearing
which
the
service
offers
to
alien
seaman
under
253.1
(f)
of
the
regulation
is
a
rather
pro
forma
the
hearing
which
results
in
the
fair
shuffle
back
to
the
ship.
they
cite
three
cases
for
that.
the
first
case
they
site
is
the
instant
case
in
which
when
an
opportunity
was
given
to
respondent
to
present
evidence.
he
completely
refused
to
give
without
any
evidence
at
all.
the
second
case
they
cite
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
well,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
mr.
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
that's
right
mr.
justice
and
the
remedy
that's
available
to
a
lawyer
in
that
type
of
case
as
in
any
administrative
procedure.
there's
any
judicial
procedure
to
ask
for
continuance
and
that's
what
the
lawyer
here
didn't
do.
the
lawyer
said
that
he
had
a
right
to
a
hearing
before
a
special
inquiry
officer
under
section
242
and
on
the
face
of
the
record
it
wouldn't
made
any
difference
if
he
had
15
minutes,
15
hours
or
15
days
to
prepare
for
it.
what
he
claimed
was
a
different
type
of
a
hearing
that
didn't
make
any
difference,
how
much
time
he
got.
but
the
other
two
cases
and
i
won't
go
into
them
now
because
time
is
running
out
or
were
also
cases,
the
kordic
case
in
the
second
circuit,
the
(inaudible)
case
in
fifth
circuit,
cases
in
which
the
hearing
was
impeded
by
a
claim
that
there
was
a
right
to
hearing
under
section
242,
but
more
than
that
i
was
worried
about
by
this
point
and
i
check
with
the
immigration
service.
and
the
immigration
service
advised
me
and
asked
me
to
represent
to
the
court
that
in
the
hearings
under
the
regulations
of
an
alien
seaman
who
claims
persecution
if
he
is
returned.
he
gets
the
exact
same
type
of
hearing
as
he
would
have
got
under
the
full
scale
242
proceeding.
he
is
entitled
to
have
counsel
--
he
is
entitled
to
have
the
assistance
of
counsel.
he
is
entitled
to
present
any
evidence
which
is
readily
available
to
them.
and
that's
exact
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
no,
sir.
that
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
the
constitutional
issue
comprises
that
difference.
but
it
comprises
only
that
difference
and
it
is
not
a
difference
in
either
the
availability
of
counsel,
the
availability
of
time,
or
the
availability
of
witnesses.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
in
all
of
those
situations
the
proceeding
is
exactly
the
same.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
mr.
justice,
i
would
assume
that
any
proceeding
in
which
you
have
a
right
to
counsel
and
you
have
a
right
to
present
evidence
that
is
readily
available.
you
also
have
a
right
to
continuance
if
you
asked
for
it
and
no
continuance
was
asked
during
this
case.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
well,
sir
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
mr.
justice,
the
record
doesn't
disclose
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
that's
right.
and
it
could
--
it
could
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
yes.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
well,
mr.
justice,
i
think
in
alternative
explanation
on
a
cold
record.
the
record
that
doesn't
disclose
anything
is
that
it
was
perhaps
in
the
nature
of
a
preliminary
examination
to
find
out
exactly
what
nature
claim
mr.
stanisic
was
raising.
we
don't
--
i
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
i
understand
sir.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
but
before
we
presume
on
a
--
i
think
its
unfair
to
presume
in
a
cold
record
that
this
immigration
service
was
giving
--
was
willing
to
give
him
only
what
he
could
have
got
within
15
minutes.
and
if
i
may
also
add
to
my
answer,
the
justice
use
the
term
a
claim
of
right,
perhaps
adopting
it
from
what
mr.
fedde
had
argued.
the
government
fails
to
see
how
under
either
the
constitution
or
the
international
protocol,
what
is
under
american
law,
a
discretionary
relief
entrusted
to
the
attorney
general.
somehow
becomes
a
claim
of
right
in
this
case.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
no,
sir.
far
from
--
all
it's
the
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
all
i'm
saying
mr.
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
certainly
mr.
justice,
it
does.
but
the
question
is,
does
he
have
the
right
to
the
relief?
he
has
a
full
right
to
claim
the
relief.
he
has
a
full
right
to
present
evidence
in
support
of
his
claim
but
the
relief
is
discretionary.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
yes,
i
think.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
mr.
chief
justice,
we've
--
i
am
implicitly
assumed
for
the
purpose
of
this
argument
that
the
protocol
imposes
on
the
government
a
right
--
an
obligation
to
allow
an
alien
seaman
in
this
country,
a
fair
opportunity
to
claim
that
he
is
a
refugee
and
a
fair
determination
that
--
of
his
refugee
status.
we've
also
assumed
that
that
was
the
individual
--
that
was
the
alien
seaman's
right
under
the
statute.
so,
in
so
far
as
the
government's
approach
to
handling
persecution
claims.
the
treaty
has
--
the
international
protocol
has
not
affected
that
the
government's
attitude
at
all.
we've
always
assumed
that
243
(h)
is
available
to
alien.
that
the
discretionary
relief
if
available
to
alien
seaman
under
the
statute,
that
we
enacted
the
right
--
we
promulgated
a
regulation
which
gives
the
alien
crewman
the
right
to
obtain
such
a
relief
--
claim
such
relief.
so,
it
hasn't
have
any
effect
at
all
then
--
and
that
is
the
--
assuming
at
the
best
that
it
has
the
--
that
the
protocol
has
the
effect
of
imposing
that
obligation
to
the
government
that
it
has
no
change
in
our
procedure.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
mr.
justice,
the
only
--
no.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
the
only
way
you
could
get
to
that
is
it
if
you
assume
that
the
man
is
a
refugee
and
under
the
government's
--
the
united
states
agreement
to
the
protocol
reserved
the
government
the
right
to
determine
whether
the
man
is
a
refugee
or
not.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
so,
if
the
government
determines
that
he
is
not
a
refugee
then
by
that
factor
--
by
that
fact
the
substantive
provisions
of
the
convention
don't
apply
to
him.
if
the
government
determines
that
he
is
a
refugee,
then
he
is
entitled
to
the
discretionary
relief
and
the
government
will
give
him
the
discretionary
relief
under
the
statute.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
thank
you
mr.
solicitor
general.
if
it
please
the
court,
this
case
arises
under
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
of
1952.
the
case
is
here
in
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
to
review
that
court's
interpretation
of
the
act's
provisions
governing
the
temporary
landing
of
alien
crewman
for
shore
leave
while
their
vessels
call
at
united
states
ports.
before
setting
forth
the
facts
of
this
case,
i
would
like
briefly
to
outline
the
statutory
provisions
which
this
case
involves.
in
parts
iv
and
v
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
act,
congress
set
out
the
basic
provisions
that
establishing
the
procedures
and
the
standards
for
the
admission
and
expulsion
of
aliens
into
and
from
the
united
states.
in
part
iv
dealing
with
admissions,
congress
provided
that
if
an
alien
presenting
himself
at
the
court
of
entry
of
the
united
states
is
denied
admission
by
an
immigration
officer.
the
alien
has
a
right
to
a
hearing
before
a
special
inquiry
officer
or
his
admissibility
and
if
he
is
stand
to
be
inadmissible.
he
may
appeal
to
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
and
from
a
finding
in
the
board
that
he
is
inadmissible,
he
may
obtain
judicial
review
by
habeas
corpus.
section
241
of
the
act,
sets
out
the
grounds
in
which
an
alien
may
be
expelled
from
the
united
states
or
deported
and
under
242
(b)
of
the
act,
when
it
is
alleged
that
an
alien
is
deportable
from
the
united
states.
he
has
the
right
to
a
hearing
before
a
special
inquiry
officer
in
which
he
may
be
represented
by
counsel.
they
present
evidence
and
has
the
right
to
cross-examine
witnesses
against
him.
sections
242
and
243
and
the
following
sections
also
provide
for
certain
forms
of
discretionary
relief
from
expulsion
or
deportation.
what
are
these
forms
of
discretionary
relief
is
under
section
243
(h)
of
the
act
which
authorizes
the
attorney
general
in
his
discretion
to
withhold
the
deportation
of
any
alien
to
any
country
in
which
his
opinion,
the
alien
may
be
subjected
to
persecution
of
an
grounds
of
race,
religion,
or
political
opinion.
under
the
regulations
issued
by
the
attorney
general
that
determination
under
section
243
(h)
is
initially
made
by
the
special
inquiry
officer
who
conducts
the
deportation
of
proceeding
under
section
242.
in
part
vi
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
act,
congress
establish
special
procedures
for
the
admission
and
in
some
cases
for
the
expulsion
of
alien
crewman.
under
section
242
(a)
of
the
act
which
is
the
exclusive
procedure
for
the
temporary
admission
of
alien
crewman,
congress
provided
that
an
immigration
officer
may
in
his
discretion
issue
a
temporary
permit
for
the
alien
crewman
to
land.
if
he
finds
that
the
alien
is
a
bona
fide
crewman
and
if
he
finds
under
subsection
(a)
(1)
of
252
that
the
alien
intends
to
depart
on
the
vessel
in
which
he
arrives,
and
the
permit
issued
under
subsection
(a)
(1)
is
good
for
the
period
during
which
the
alien
crewman's
vessel
is
in
port.
the
section
further
provides
that
the
alien
crewman
must
agree
to
accept
such
a
permit
which
is
conditioned
upon
his
being
deported
from
the
united
states
as
provided
in
subsection
(b)
of
the
statute.
that
section,
subsection
(b)
provides
that
if
an
immigration
officer
determines
that
the
alien
no
longer
intends
to
depart
on
the
vessel
on
which
he
arrived.
the
alien
--
the
immigration
officer
may
take
out
and
revoke
the
permit,
take
the
crewman
into
custody
and
if
practicable
remove
him
to
the
vessel
in
which
he
arrived
from
removal
from
the
united
states
on
board
that
vessel.
the
act
provides
it
the
alien
whom
and
shall
be
deported
from
the
united
states,
the
expense
of
the
transportation
line
which
brought
him.
the
last
section
of
section
252
(b)
is
particularly
important
in
this
case.
it
provides
that
nothing
in
this
section
shall
be
construed
to
require
the
procedure
prescribed
in
section
242
of
the
act,
the
hearing
before
a
special
inquiry
officer
to
cases
falling
within
the
provisions
of
this
subsection
section
252
(a)
in
the
set
out
on
page
41
and
42
of
the
government's
brief.
regulations
issued
by
the
attorney
general
dealing
with
alien
crewman
also
provide
for
a
--
the
parole
of
an
alien
crewman
who
alleges
that
he
may
be
persecuted
if
he
is
returned
to
his
homeland.
thus,
reflecting
the
discretionary
relief
available
under
section
243
(h)
of
the
act.
now
in
this
case,
respondent,
a
native
and
citizen
of
yugoslavia
arrived
in
this
country
shortly
before
christmas
in
1964
as
a
member
of
a
crew,
the
radio
officer
of
a
yugoslavian
vessel.
he
was
issued
to
conditional
landing
permit
under
section
252
(a)
of
the
act.
good
for
the
time
that
his
vessel
would
remain
in
the
port
in
oregon
and
on
condition
that
respondent
leave
the
united
states
with
his
ship.
he
went
ashore
in
january
4,
1965
and
he
went
directly
to
the
home
of
a
cousin
in
the
company
of
another
crewman
on
board
that
ship.
and
a
day
later
they
both
returned
to
the
immigration
office
in
portland,
oregon
i
believe
and
claimed
that
they've
claim
this
--
sought
asylum
in
the
united
states
on
the
grant
that
they
would
be
persecuted
if
they
were
return
to
yugoslavia.
when
representations
which
respondent
made
to
the
immigration
officer
at
that
time
that
he
would
not
under
any
circumstances
return
to
his
ship.
his
conditional
landing
permit
was
revoked
and
he
was
detained
at
the
office.
on
the
following
day
the
district
director
gave
respondent
an
opportunity
to
present
a
statement
and
evidence
in
support
of
his
claim
that
he
would
be
persecuted
if
he
were
return
to
yugoslavia.
this
was
under
the
regulation
which
is
set
out
its
regulation
253.1
(f)
now
and
it
is
set
out
on
page
46
of
the
government's
brief.
upon
advice
of
counsel,
respondent
refuse
to
give
any
evidence
or
make
any
statement
in
support
of
his
claim.
he
contended
that
he
had
a
right
to
a
hearing
before
a
special
inquiry
officer
under
242
(b)
on
his
claim
of
anticipated
persecution
under
243
(h)
and
he
said
that
he
wouldn't
give
any
evidence
to
the
district
director
at
that
time.
consequently,
the
district
director
without
any
evidence
in
support
of
the
claim
denied
the
application
for
parole
and
ordered
that
the
respondent
be
removed
to
a
ship.
respondent
then
brought
suit
in
the
district
court
and
bargained
to
enjoin
the
district
director
from
removing
him
to
his
ship.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
the
ground
that
the
district
director's
action
in
denying
parole?
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
under
the
regulation?
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
there
was
no
evidence
at
all
mr.
justice,
respondent
refused
to
give
any
evidence
claiming
that
he
had
a
right
to
a
different
procedure.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
there
was
no
showing.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
yes.
his
memorandum
of
january
7
is
set
out
in
the
appendix
on
page
5.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
well,
mr.
justice
it
doesn't
really
appear
from
the
record
exactly
what
the
basis
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
the
ship
was
still
in
port
at
that
time.
the
ship
was
still
in
port
at
the
time
at
that
he
claimed
asylum
in
the
united
states.
he
was
still
in
port
at
the
time
that
his
landing
privilege
was
revoked.
he
was
still
in
port
in
the
following
day
when
he
refused
to
get
any
evidence
in
support
of
his
claim.
i
will
touch
upon
that
issue
in
just
second
because
it
--
in
order
to
refine
the
issue
before
the
court
which
is
not
to
give
--
assure
the
nature
of
the
claim
to
the
hearing
under
242
(b).
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
he
demanded
a
hearing
before
a
special
inquiry
officer
pursuant
to
section
242
(b)
which
is
set
out
in
the
government's
brief
on
pages
39
and
40.
that's
what
he
claimed
he
said
that
under
243
(h)
which
authorize
the
discretionary
relief
he
had
the
right
to
a
hearing
under
242
(b).
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
the
record
doesn't
disclose
mr.
justice
whether
there
were
any
special
inquiry
officers,
mr.
chief
justice,
whether
there
were
any
special
inquiry
officers
in
oregon
at
the
time.
it
doesn't
disclose
exactly
what
the
nature
the
evidence
that
he
intended
to
present.
we
can
assume
that
it
would
be
somewhat
of
a
time
consuming
procedure.
how
long
i
just
can't
estimate.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
conceivably
it
would
be.
the
supplement
--
the
government
provide
that
the
record
shows
that
he
ship
sailed
from
oregon
sometime
after
the
7th
and
sailed
from
somewhere
in
california
for
italy
around
the
16th.
so,
we
just
really
don't
know
whether
it
would
have
been
possible
to
hold
such
a
hearing.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
my
understanding,
mr.
justice
would
be
that
under
the
act,
he
would
not
be
subject
to
section
252
(b)
but
that
he
must
be
preceded
against
under
section
2
--
on
the
grounds
stated
in
241
and
under
the
proceeding
in
section
242
(b).
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
that
is
right
mr.
justice
and
i
intend
to
deal
with
that
question
later
on
as
to
whether
the
discrimination
between
a
crewman
who
gets
a
permit
and
a
crewman
who
jumped
ship
makes
any
sense
at
all.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
that
is
right
mr.
justice
and
i
also
intend
to
deal
with
that
form
of
discrimination.
to
continue
on
with
the
facts,
after
the
district
director
denied
his
claim
for
parole,
he
sued
to
enjoin
the
district
director
from
removing
him
to
his
ship.
the
district
court
and
claim
to
that
time
also
that
he
had
to
write
to
a
hearing
before
a
special
inquiry
officer.
the
district
court
denied
his
claim
that
he
had
a
right
to
a
hearing
before
a
special
inquiry
officer
but
remanded
the
case
back
to
the
district
director
for
the
taking
of
evidence,
an
opportunity
which
respondent
accepted
at
this
time
and
presented
his
evidence.
when
the
evidence
presented,
the
district
director
found
that
there
was
insufficient,
the
showing
of
a
sufficient
likelihood
of
the
persecution
to
justify
granting
the
parole
of
the
discretionary
relief.
and
ordered
--
and
denied
the
application
again.
on
review,
the
district
court
found
that
the
district
director's
determination
was
not
an
abuse
of
discretion
and
agreed
with
the
district
director
that
there
had
been
a
showing
made
of
any
sufficient
likelihood
of
persecution.
respondent
did
not
appeal
that
determination
by
the
district
court
instead
he
sought
relief
by
private
bill
in
congress
when
that
bill
was
adversely
acted
upon
in
the
following
year
in
1966,
he
again
petition
for
parole
for
withholding
a
deportation
administratively.
again,
claiming
a
hearing
under
section
242,
that
relief
was
denied
by
the
district
director
on
the
ground
that
the
prior
proceeding
was
a
fully
adequate
hearing
and
that
the
determination
had
been
made
adversely
to
respond.
he
sued
again
in
the
district
court
to
enjoin
the
district
director
from
deporting
him.
the
district
court
found
that
the
prior
proceedings
were
fully
adequate,
denied
the
relief.
on
appeal
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit,
the
court
held
that
in
view
of
the
fact
that
respondent's
ship
had
sailed
during
the
pendency
of
the
administrative
proceedings
on
his
claim
of
anticipated
persecution
that
the
revocation
of
the
condition
of
landing
permit
under
section
252
(b)
was
no
longer
proper
basis
for
the
deportation
of
respondent.
the
court
held

the

crewman
is
in
fact
removed
on
his
ship.
the
revocation
or
the
expulsion
proceedings
under
section
252
plus
the
board
and
the
alien
crewman
is
entitled
in
all
matters
with
respect
to
the
revocation
and
in
all
matters
of
discretionary
relief
to
a
hearing
under
section
242
(b).
we
disagree
with
the
holding
of
the
district
--
the
holding
of
the
court
of
appeals.
we
believe
that
so
long
as
the
alien
crewman's
conditional
landing
permit
is
revoke
during
the
time
that
is
in
effect,
that
is
during
the
time
with
the
alien
ship
is
still
in
port,
that
it
presents
a
fully
adequate
basis
for
removal
of
the
crewman
from
the
united
states
at
determination
of
any
administrative
or
judicial
proceedings
that
he
might
invoke
on
the
question
of
his
deportability
or
the
question
of
any
discretionary
relief.
and
mr.
justice
brennan
asked
the
question
earlier,
what
was
the
basis
of
his
prior
claim
that
he
had
a
right
to
a
hearing
under
section
242
(b)?
we
really
don't
know.
we
assume
that
by
the
respondent's
position
in
this
court
in
defending
the
judgment
of
court
of
appeals
is
that
he
has
the
right
to
a
hearing
before
a
special
inquiry
officer
under
242
(b)
because
that's
the
way
such
claims
are
handled
in
regular
242
(b)
proceedings
which
the
court
of
appeals
held
he
now
has
a
right
too.
i
have
been
unable
to
find
any
basis
upon
which
it
could
be
inferred
merely
from
section
243
(h)
itself
that
it
is
a
right
to
a
hearing
before
a
special
inquiry
officer.
it
would
seem
that
the
court
of
appeals
took
the
only
statutory
approach
that
can
be
made
in
this
case
and
that
is
to
find
the
right
to
a
hearing
before
a
special
inquiry
officer,
in
the
right
to
a
hearing
before
a
special
inquiry
officer
on
all
claims
and
all
grounds
of
deportation
in
this
case.
we
begin
our
consideration
of
the
statutory
issue
in
this
case.
he
responded
also
raise
his
constitutional
claim,
the
statutory
issue
with
the
hypothetical.
suppose
an
alien
crewman
is
issued
a
conditional
landing
permit
under
section
252
(a),
good
for
the
time
that
his
ship
is
to
remain
in
port.
immediately
leaves
his
ship
and
goes
several
hundred
miles
inland
where
he
obtains
employment
and
a
training
program
of
a
manufacturing
plant
and
enters
into
a
long
term
lease,
a
year's
lease
on
an
apartment.
during
the
time
that
his
ship
is
still
in
port,
he
is
found
by
an
immigration
officer
and
on
the
evidence
of
his
conduct
his
landing
permit
is
revoked.
he
is
brought
back
to
the
port
city
and
without
objection
placed
to
aboard
his
ship
which
sails
the
next
day
for
foreign
port.
now,
as
our
search
reveals
that
all
courts
which
have
considered
the
question
of
interpreting
section
252
(a)
and
(d)
including
the
court
below
in
the
instant
case
would
agree
that
the
immigration
officer
in
that
case
acted
properly.
but
the
difficulty
is
of
course,
that
in
the
hypothetical
which
we
presented,
the
alien's
voluntary
departure
from
this
country.
well,
voluntary
in
the
sense
that
uncontested
departure
moots
any
challenge
to
the
conduct
of
the
immigration
officer.
now,
we
don't
believe
that
congress
enact
its
section
252
merely
to
provide
a
basis
for
or
direction
for
conduct
by
an
immigration
officer
in
a
situation
that
it
couldn't
be
challenge
in
court.
we
believe
that
congress
envision
that
alien
crewman
would
exercise
their
rights
for
admini
--
for
judicial
review
certainly
of
the
conduct
of
immigration
officers
under
the
statute
and
congress
presumably
recognized
that
in
those
case,
it
is
unlikely
to
be
alien's
ship
would
wait
for
him
until
the
expiration
--
until
the
judicial
proceedings
were
terminated.
the
respondent
adopts
the
reasoning
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
approaches
the
problem
from
the
other
side.
they
say
--
the
respondent
says,
well,
the
section
252
(b)
procedure
did
not
apply
to
the
case
where
an
alien
crewman
is
jumps
--
where
an
alien
jumps
his
ship
and
enters
the
united
states
without
a
permit.
under
the
case
where
he
gets
a
permit
to
ship
out
in
another
ship,
where
a
case
in
which
his
permit
is
not
revoked
while
his
ship
is
still
in
port
but
he
stays
on
longer
than
that
and
they
say
it,
well,
since
the
statute
is
thus
narrowly
designed.
it
ought
to
be
construed
more
strictly
to
apply
only
in
the
case
where
the
alien
is
in
fact
deported
on
his
ship.
now,
we
disagree
with
that
proposition.
we
admit
that
from
the
face
of
the
statute,
congress
apparently
contemplated
that
the
alien
crewman
ship
would
be
one
of,
if
not
the
primary.
it
means,
for
removing
him
from
the
united
states
but
if
congress
had
wanted
that
to
be
the
sole
basis,
the
sole
means
for
removing
him
from
the
united
states.
if
congress
wanted
to
limit
the
statute
only
the
situations,
and
where
the
alien
is
in
fact
removed
on
a
ship,
it
could
have
done
so.
we
believe
that
it
begs
the
question
in
this
case,
to
say
as
the
court
of
appeals
did.
that
the
necessity
--
the
justification
for
proper
removal.
the
justification
for
quick
resolution
departs
with
the
vessel.
that
assumes
the
congress
contemplated
only
that
alien
crewman
would
be
deported
on
their
ships.
we
don't
believe
that
that
was
a
contemplation
at
all.
they
determined
when
the
basis
--
the
congress
determined
on
the
basis
of
evidence
that
there
was
a
severe
problem
of
alien
crewman
deserting
their
ships.
that
it
--
there
would
be
a
special
class
of
alien
crewman
who
would
be
granted
conditional
landing
permits
only
on
their
agreement
to
depart
with
their
ship
and
then
if
they
fail
to
that
agreement
during
the
time
their
ships
were
still
in
port,
they
were
immediately
deportable
whether
on
their
ships,
whether
on
another
ship
with
the
same
line
or
whether
after
the
determination
of
any
administrative
or
judicial
proceedings.
now
a
question
has
been
raised,
well
--
could
congress
rationally
have
made
this
determination?
when
it
exempted
from
such
procedures
the
crewman
who
jumped
their
ships
or
crewmen
who
were
admitted
to
ship
out
in
another
vessel,
although,
the
legislative
history
doesn't
provide
any
guidance
on
this
question.
we
believe
that
congress
rationally
would
have
made
such
a
determination.
the
alien
crewman
who
jumps
his
ship
and
enters
without
a
permit
at
all,
where
the
alien
crewman
who
overstays
his
conditional
landing
permit
without
it
being
revoked
may
be
found
10
days,
3
months,
or
10
years
later,
and
the
10
years
later
issue
is
one
that
i
think
that
provides
a
basis
for
distinction
between
the
two
cases
because
unlike
an
alien
who
may
have
been
in
this
country
for
10
years,
albeit
illegally.
and
it
established
family
relationships
and
other
relationships
which
presents
some
equities
in
this
case.
the
alien
crewman
whose
conditional
landing
permit
is
revoked
under
section
252
(b)
has
been
here
at
the
most
for
less
than
29
days,
at
the
most
for
the
time
that
the
ship
has
been
in
ports.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
suppose
he
stayed
two
months?
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
well,
i
think
that
the
argument
that
i'm
making
does
not
require
that
you
draw
the
lines
between
two
months
and
three
months,
three
months
and
four
months
without
this
--
the
--
without
in
effect
the
statutory
limitations
period
of
section
252
(b).
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
no,
because
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
no,
sir.
if
he's
here
for
two
months
or
10
years,
he
gets
a
proceeding
under
section
242
(b).
if
he's
here
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
it's
the
same
thing
mr.
justice
because
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
--
because
we
can't
impose
any
other
statutory
limitations
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
that
is
right.
and
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
yes,
sir.
i
do.
now,
i'd
like
to
turn
in
very
little
time
that
i
have
left
to
respondent's
challenge
that
the
statute
is
interpreted
by
the
united
states,
violates
his
right
to
due
process
under
the
fifth
amendment
and
also
the
government's
obligations
under
the
protocol
relating
to
the
statute
as
the
status
of
refugees.
i
think
that
both
of
these
--
both
claims
can
be
comprise
to
do
a
single
federal
due
process
claim.
the
protocol
incorporates
by
a
reference,
certain
provisions
of
an
international
convention
on
the
same
subject
and
respondent
in
amicus
cite
certain
provisions
of
that
convention
which
relate
to
the
expulsion
of
refugees
on
the
assumption
that
respondent
is
a
refugee.
but
the
accepted
international
construction
of
the
convention
as
the
state
department
advised
the
senate
when
it
was
considering
the
protocol.
is
that
each
of
the
contracting
states
reserves
the
right
to
interpret
the
convention
to
make
the
determination
whether
an
individual
is
a
refugee
and
in
this
case
after
a
hearing
in
which
he
was
entitled
to
present
which
he
did
present
evidence
and
was
represented
by
counsel,
the
district
director
found
that
the
respondent
was
not
a
refugee.
now,
on
respondent's
federal
due
process
claim,
we
note
first
that
respondent
is
not
here
and
has
not
as
far
as
we
know
at
any
time
during
these
proceedings
challenge
the
revocation
of
this
conditional
landing
permit
has
been
anything
other
than
a
fully
adequate
constitutional
basis
for
his
removal
from
the
united
states.
nor
does
he
challenge
--
nor
does
he
contend
that
the
revocation
of
his
conditional
landing
permit
was
arbitrary.
it
hardly
can
be
contended
in
light
of
his
representations
to
the
immigration
officer
that
it
was
arbitrary
in
this
case.
we
ca
--
respondent's
request
for
asylum
therefore
was
a
request
of
an
alien
who
is
deportability
had
been
properly
determined
in
a
proceeding
in
unchallenged
proceeding.
furthermore,
it
was
a
request
for
discretionary
relief
in
case
somewhat
analogies
to
the
situation
before
the
court
in
jay
versus
boyd
in
351
u.s.
and
a
case
in
which
respondent
had
the
burden
of
showing
that
in
his
case,
he
will
be
subject
to
persecution.
as
i
said
before,
he
was
given
a
hearing
before
a
--
the
deputy
district
director
of
the
immigration
service
in
which
he
was
represented
by
counsel.
he
was
permitted
to
present
--
it
testified
himself
and
presented
two
other
witnesses.
and
the
district
director
found
that
there
was
not
showing
--
sufficient
showing
of
person
--
a
likelihood
of
persecution
and
that
finding
was
upheld
by
the
district
court.
so
the
only
difference
between
the
procedure
which
respondent
received
in
this
case
and
the
procedure
which
he
would
have
receive
under
section
242
(b)
under
a
243
(h)
claim
is
that
the
determination
was
made
by
the
district
director
rather
than
the
special
inquiry
officer.
so
the
question
is
in
the
case
of
an
admittedly
deportable
alien
seeking
discretionary
relief
from
the
ground
of
anticipated
persecution
whether
it
is
consistent
with
due
process,
to
have
that
discretion
exercise
by
the
district
director
rather
than
the
special
inquiry
officer.
and
we
do
not
believe
that
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case
fundamental
fairness
required
that
in
the
case
in
which
all
other
contentions
where
to
be
adjudicated
by
the
district
director
that
it
was
necessary
constitutionally
to
some
and
special
inquiry
officer
to
determine
this
claim.
i'd
like
to
reserve
what
time
is
remaining
for
rebuttal.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
mr.
chief
justice,
the
chief
justice
was
very
kind
in
extending
the
government's
time
in
which
improvidently
was
terminated
its
opening
statement
because
there's
a
matters
of
some
importance,
some
very
great
importance
in
this
case
in
which
the
government
and
the
respondent
strongly
disagree.
the
first
place
the
respondent
has
--
respondent's
counsel
has
painted
the
picture
of
an
individual
who
in
good
conscience
after
coming
ashore
rather
than
trying
to
fade
into
the
population
presents
himself
in
the
immigration
office
to
claim
the
asylum
under
the
statute.
i
would
like
to
call
--
to
invite
the
court's
attention
to
respondent's
testimony
before
the
deputy
district
director
on
remand
from
the
district
court
to
pages
12,
14,
20
to
22,
29,
and
30
of
his
testimony
which
is
in
the
record
in
the
court
filed
in
the
little
manila
folder.
it
is
not
printed.
it
is
the
government's
position
that
that
testimony
gives
persuasive
evidence
that
respondent
entertained
the
idea
and
the
intention
well
before
he
came
into
oregon
this
time
to
desert
his
ship
and
to
remain
permanently
in
the
united
states.
at
the
time
that
he
came
to
oregon,
he
obtained
the
conditional
landing
permit
from
an
immigration
officer
on
his
agreement
to
return
with
his
ship,
in
his
representation
to
the
immigration
officer
that
he
was
going
to
return
with
ship
and
then
he
was
not
going
to
desert
a
ship.
i
think
the
best
thing
that
you
can
say
on
the
basis
of
this
evidence
is
that
the
position
that
respondent
finds
himself
now
is
to
scheme
that
was
initially
conceived
in
this
representation.
if
he
had
told
--
if
he
had
been
honest
with
the
immigration
officer
and
told
him
that
he
is
claiming
political
asylum
because
of
anticipated
persecution.
he
clearly
would
not
have
been
entitled
to
a
temporary
landing
permit
under
section
252.
he
would
been
given
a
hearing
under
the
regulations
as
to
whether
he
may
be
paroled
in
the
united
states
but
in
such
a
case
that
determination
would
be
made
by
the
district
director
as
it
was
actually
in
the
present
case
then
he
would
have
no
colorable
claim
to
a
hearing
before
special
inquiry
officer.
so,
in
the
basis
of
initial
misrepresentation
he
is
permitted
his
status
into
a
situation
where
he
is
just
completely
made
a
shambles
of
the
whole
statutory
scheme.
and
the
next
point
that
i'd
like
to
bring
out
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
the
argument
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
well,
i
think
after
mr.
stanisic
got
on
shore
he
did
miraculously
well
against
what
congress
direct
from
the
statute.
the
only
point
that
i'm
trying
to
--
the
essential
point
that
i'm
trying
to
make
is
that
he
was
asked
one
question
by
the
immigration
officer
when
the
immigration
officer
came
aboard
a
ship
and
that
is,
“do
you
intend
to
depart
with
your
ship?”
and
he
said,
“yes.”
and
that's
how
he
got
a
conditional
landing
permit
and
the
evidence
in
the
record,
we
believe,
discloses
that
he
didn't
intend
to
depart
with
the
ship.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
the
matter
of
what
he
said
is
that
he
is
--
he
delayed
--
he
say
--
delayed
getting
married
and
jumping
ship
until
he
could
get
to
the
united
states
because
he
saw
that
--
he
have
been
in
the
united
states
six
times
and
he
delayed
jumping
ship
until
he
got
to
oregon
because
he
had
a
cousin
in
oregon
that
could
help
him.
so,
this
was
in
any
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
he
would
have
been
entitled
to
a
hearing
under
section
242
and
because
of
the
narrowness
of
section
252
that
it
would
have
been
no
exemption
from
that
hearing
requirement.
he
would
have
gotten
the
242
hearing.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
he
did
--
yes.
he
did
go
and
tell
the
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
no,
sir.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
the
record
we
believe
is
supplemented
by
the
government
shows
that
at
the
time
that
he
presented
himself
to
the
immigration
officer
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
no,
sir.
that
is
not
what
happened
in
this
case.
the
ship
was
here
when
he
presented
himself
to
the
immigration
officer.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
if
--
under
the
stature
mr.
justice,
unless
the
landing
permit
is
revoked
while
the
ship
is
in
port.
unless
you
get
a
hold
of
the
alien
and
revoke
his
permit
while
the
ship
in
port.
he
must
be
proceeded
against
under
the
full
procedures.
so,
we
would
have
had
this
case
at
the
ship
had
been
in
port
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
that's
right.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
well,
no
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
no,
sir.
i
didn't
get
it.
now,
the
next
day
and
i
think
more
important
point
that
i'd
like
to
make
is
that
respondent
relies
quite
heavily
on
the
statement
of
the
brief
of
the
amicus
american
civil
liberties
union
to
the
effect
that
the
hearing
which
the
service
offers
to
alien
seaman
under
253.1
(f)
of
the
regulation
is
a
rather
pro
forma
the
hearing
which
results
in
the
fair
shuffle
back
to
the
ship.
they
cite
three
cases
for
that.
the
first
case
they
site
is
the
instant
case
in
which
when
an
opportunity
was
given
to
respondent
to
present
evidence.
he
completely
refused
to
give
without
any
evidence
at
all.
the
second
case
they
cite
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
well,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
mr.
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
that's
right
mr.
justice
and
the
remedy
that's
available
to
a
lawyer
in
that
type
of
case
as
in
any
administrative
procedure.
there's
any
judicial
procedure
to
ask
for
continuance
and
that's
what
the
lawyer
here
didn't
do.
the
lawyer
said
that
he
had
a
right
to
a
hearing
before
a
special
inquiry
officer
under
section
242
and
on
the
face
of
the
record
it
wouldn't
made
any
difference
if
he
had
15
minutes,
15
hours
or
15
days
to
prepare
for
it.
what
he
claimed
was
a
different
type
of
a
hearing
that
didn't
make
any
difference,
how
much
time
he
got.
but
the
other
two
cases
and
i
won't
go
into
them
now
because
time
is
running
out
or
were
also
cases,
the
kordic
case
in
the
second
circuit,
the
(inaudible)
case
in
fifth
circuit,
cases
in
which
the
hearing
was
impeded
by
a
claim
that
there
was
a
right
to
hearing
under
section
242,
but
more
than
that
i
was
worried
about
by
this
point
and
i
check
with
the
immigration
service.
and
the
immigration
service
advised
me
and
asked
me
to
represent
to
the
court
that
in
the
hearings
under
the
regulations
of
an
alien
seaman
who
claims
persecution
if
he
is
returned.
he
gets
the
exact
same
type
of
hearing
as
he
would
have
got
under
the
full
scale
242
proceeding.
he
is
entitled
to
have
counsel
--
he
is
entitled
to
have
the
assistance
of
counsel.
he
is
entitled
to
present
any
evidence
which
is
readily
available
to
them.
and
that's
exact
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
no,
sir.
that
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
the
constitutional
issue
comprises
that
difference.
but
it
comprises
only
that
difference
and
it
is
not
a
difference
in
either
the
availability
of
counsel,
the
availability
of
time,
or
the
availability
of
witnesses.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
in
all
of
those
situations
the
proceeding
is
exactly
the
same.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
mr.
justice,
i
would
assume
that
any
proceeding
in
which
you
have
a
right
to
counsel
and
you
have
a
right
to
present
evidence
that
is
readily
available.
you
also
have
a
right
to
continuance
if
you
asked
for
it
and
no
continuance
was
asked
during
this
case.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
well,
sir
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
mr.
justice,
the
record
doesn't
disclose
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
that's
right.
and
it
could
--
it
could
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
yes.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
well,
mr.
justice,
i
think
in
alternative
explanation
on
a
cold
record.
the
record
that
doesn't
disclose
anything
is
that
it
was
perhaps
in
the
nature
of
a
preliminary
examination
to
find
out
exactly
what
nature
claim
mr.
stanisic
was
raising.
we
don't
--
i
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
i
understand
sir.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
but
before
we
presume
on
a
--
i
think
its
unfair
to
presume
in
a
cold
record
that
this
immigration
service
was
giving
--
was
willing
to
give
him
only
what
he
could
have
got
within
15
minutes.
and
if
i
may
also
add
to
my
answer,
the
justice
use
the
term
a
claim
of
right,
perhaps
adopting
it
from
what
mr.
fedde
had
argued.
the
government
fails
to
see
how
under
either
the
constitution
or
the
international
protocol,
what
is
under
american
law,
a
discretionary
relief
entrusted
to
the
attorney
general.
somehow
becomes
a
claim
of
right
in
this
case.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
no,
sir.
far
from
--
all
it's
the
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
all
i'm
saying
mr.
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
certainly
mr.
justice,
it
does.
but
the
question
is,
does
he
have
the
right
to
the
relief?
he
has
a
full
right
to
claim
the
relief.
he
has
a
full
right
to
present
evidence
in
support
of
his
claim
but
the
relief
is
discretionary.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
yes,
i
think.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
mr.
chief
justice,
we've
--
i
am
implicitly
assumed
for
the
purpose
of
this
argument
that
the
protocol
imposes
on
the
government
a
right
--
an
obligation
to
allow
an
alien
seaman
in
this
country,
a
fair
opportunity
to
claim
that
he
is
a
refugee
and
a
fair
determination
that
--
of
his
refugee
status.
we've
also
assumed
that
that
was
the
individual
--
that
was
the
alien
seaman's
right
under
the
statute.
so,
in
so
far
as
the
government's
approach
to
handling
persecution
claims.
the
treaty
has
--
the
international
protocol
has
not
affected
that
the
government's
attitude
at
all.
we've
always
assumed
that
243
(h)
is
available
to
alien.
that
the
discretionary
relief
if
available
to
alien
seaman
under
the
statute,
that
we
enacted
the
right
--
we
promulgated
a
regulation
which
gives
the
alien
crewman
the
right
to
obtain
such
a
relief
--
claim
such
relief.
so,
it
hasn't
have
any
effect
at
all
then
--
and
that
is
the
--
assuming
at
the
best
that
it
has
the
--
that
the
protocol
has
the
effect
of
imposing
that
obligation
to
the
government
that
it
has
no
change
in
our
procedure.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
mr.
justice,
the
only
--
no.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
the
only
way
you
could
get
to
that
is
it
if
you
assume
that
the
man
is
a
refugee
and
under
the
government's
--
the
united
states
agreement
to
the
protocol
reserved
the
government
the
right
to
determine
whether
the
man
is
a
refugee
or
not.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
so,
if
the
government
determines
that
he
is
not
a
refugee
then
by
that
factor
--
by
that
fact
the
substantive
provisions
of
the
convention
don't
apply
to
him.
if
the
government
determines
that
he
is
a
refugee,
then
he
is
entitled
to
the
discretionary
relief
and
the
government
will
give
him
the
discretionary
relief
under
the
statute.
mr.
joseph
j.
connolly
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
