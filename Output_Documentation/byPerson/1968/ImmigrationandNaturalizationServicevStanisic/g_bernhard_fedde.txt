mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
bernhard
fedde
from
portland,
oregon
and
this
story
--
this
case
is
a
story
of
a
seaman
who
is
trying
to
comply
with
the
law.
he
is
not
a
deserting
seaman
trying
to
evade
the
law.
i
think
that
makes
a
major
difference
in
this
case.
the
question
which
i
believe
is
before
this
court
is
whether
an
alien
merchant
seaman
who
enters
this
country
on
a
d-1
landing
permit
is
entitled
to
an
impartial
hearing
before
an
independent
and
impartial
administrative
judge
on
his
bona
fide
claim
of
right
to
stay
here
to
escape
prosecution.
now,
as
i
originally
phrase
this
question,
i
insert
the
words
after
his
ship
sails.
i'm
not
sure
now
after
reading
the
brief
of
mr.
ennis'
amicus
in
the
--
of
the
american
civil
liberties
of
union
whether
i
need
to
insert
that
any
longer.
in
light
of
the
treaty
which
provides
--
which
protects
refugees
and
deserting
seaman,
all
the
deserting
seaman
chapter
applies
only
in
that
treaty
or
protocol
applies
only
to
seaman,
foreign
seaman
flying
in
our
case
under
the
american
flag.
i
believe
therefore
the
question
really
boils
down
to
this
and
our
theory
is
that
a
seaman
with
a
bona
fide
claim
of
right
is
entitle
to
a
plenary
hearing
with
full
right
of
appeal
under
section
242
in
light
of
the
new
treaty
and
to
the
constitution
and
laws
and
cases.
that's
our
position.
i'd
like
to
state
briefly
and
enlarge
upon
a
statement
of
facts.
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
no.
it
was
on
the
ground
that
he
had,
i
believe
it
was
the
question
of
statutory
interpretation
after
the
ship
had
sailed.
i
believe
that
was
the
narrower
question
which
was
presented.
i
believe
that
as
i
have
stated
it's
a
broader
question
mr.
chief
justice
and
that
the
--
this
would
--
i
have
stated
now,
it
may
not
be
necessary
for
my
case
but
i
believe
that
is
necessary
for
the
court
each
case
which
is
the
one
which
mr.
ennis
in
the
amicus
brief
is
supporting.
but
i
believe
that
as
stated
now
it
would
be
adequate
to
cover
both
and
i
have
grown
to
this
conclusion
as
i
have
been
pondering
the
statute
and
the
cases.
now
first
of
all,
the
government
has
pointed
as
argued
that
we
had
not
protested
the
revocation
of
the
landing
permit.
the
facts
are
that
stanisic
with
a
valid
landing
permit
on
january
6,
1965
sought
out
the
immigration
service
and
presented
to
the
immigration
service
a
claim
of
asylum
before
his
expi
--
before
his
landing
permit
had
been
revoked.
there
was
--
he
was
making
at
and
he
had
10
days
to
go
really
as
far
as
it
turned
out,
as
far
as
the
ship
was
concerned.
the
ship
was
around
for
another
10
or
more
days.
he
sought
asylum.
did
he
have
reason?
yes,
30
out
45
members
of
his
family
which
was
a
chetnik
yugoslav
family
have
been
executed
or
killed
in
the
course
of
world
war
ii
and
the
war
immediately
following.
his
own
father,
who
was
an
orthodox
priest's
assistant,
had
been
deprived
of
his
church
function
and
had
been
deprived
of
his
pension
rights,
and
was
living
a
borderline
starvation
life
in
yugoslavia.
the
--
he
himself
stanisic
in
1957,
had
tried
to
escape
from
yugoslavia.
he
was
caught
by
some
fisherman
just
outside
the
(inaudible).
he
was
brought
back
and
then
was
threatened
with
life
imprisonment
by
a
court
man.
now,
this
doesn't
comport
with
my
idea
of
fairness
and
due
process
when
the
court
in
advance
of
the
next
defense
announces
what
he's
going
to
do.
they
said,
“you're
going
to
have
life
imprisonment
the
next
time
you
appear
before
this
court.”
this
is
why
this
--
in
my
opinion
is
a
serious
case
of
a
claim
of
bona
fide
right
of
asylum.
i
think
this
makes
every
difference
in
the
world.
now,
--
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
no.
they
were
not
--
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
we
have
15
minutes
notice.
the
--
in
--
on
the
bottom
of
page
3
of
my
brief,
the
respondent's
brief
is
a
--
an
excerpt
from
an
affidavit
of
mr.
robinson
who
was
at
that
time
counsel
for
stanisic
to
outline
the
exact
chronology
of
events.
stanisic
appeared
on
january
6
and
asked
for
asylum.
he
was
taken
to
rocky
butte
jail
in
portland.
on
january
7,
he
was
told
that
--
he
was
asked
by
the
immigration
officials
without
the
benefit
of
any
counsel,
“do
you
intend
to
return
to
your
ship?”
this
of
course
is
the
trick
question.
he
didn't
know
what
was
the
--
he
just
answered
honestly,
“no,
i
don't.”
and
then
they
said,
“your
landing
permit
is
revoked.”
he
had
announced
that
he
was
coming
there
for
asylum,
then
is
subsequently
his
landing
permit
was
revoked
and
then
it
was
that
12
--
at
11
o'clock
some
members
on
january
7,
the
day
after
he
had
appealed
for
asylum.
members
of
his
family,
toskovic
actually
came
to
mr.
robinson's
office
and
said,
“we
need
help.”
mr.
robinson
was
in
of
the
court
at
that
time.
he
announced
--
however
he
filed
a
formal
appearance
about
12
o'clock
that
day
one
hour
later.
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
january
7th,
still
the
same
day.
we
are
now
45
minutes
later.
this
is
all
working
on
split-second
timing
and
then
--
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
january
7,
the
day
after
he
was
first
--
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
--
he
first
made
his
claim.
yes,
that's
right.
he
had
still
not
seen
any
lawyer
until
--
no,
stanisic
had
not
seen
any
lawyer
but
his
uncle
or
cousin
toskovic
had
on
the
following
day,
january
7
about
11
a.m.
at
12
o'clock,
robinson
filed
his
appearance
and
went
to
another
court
where
he
had
to
be
it
1:30.
at
3
o'clock
that
day,
he
got
a
telephone
call
from
the
immigration
service
saying,
“you
are
due
to
have
your
hearing
on
the
question
of
asylum
in
15
minutes.”
robinson
couldn't
prepare
any
case
in
that
short
order
and
the
--
mr.
urbano
who
was
then
the
district
director,
simply
insisted
that
the
matter
proceed
at
once
and
it
was
then
that
mr.
robinson
said,
“we
can't
proceed
and
we're
not
going
to
present
any
evidence.
in
fact
we
demand
a
242
hearing.”
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
yes,
it
is.
well,
it
--
yes,
it
is.
it's
in
the
record.
you
see
it's
a
--
i
don't
know
if
could
find
it
on
spur
of
the
moment
like
this.
it's
in
the
--
well,
it's
in
this
on
page
3
an
affidavit
of
mr.
robinson
where
to
some
of
this
appears.
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
yes,
i
think
it
is.
it's
--
perhaps
not,
i
would
--
i
should
perhaps
move
to
have
that
extended
then
and
have
the
record
extended
to
include
this
affidavit
of
mr.
robinson.
i
believe
that
the
affidavit
appears
in
the
proceedings
in
the
entire
file
which
was
sent
up
to
the
court.
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
that
was
filed
january
7,
1965
in
connection
with
the
petition
for
restraining
order
which
mr.
robinson
then
prepared
that
same
day.
i'm
sure
it's
in
the
record
because
--
yes,
it
is.
it's
in
connection
with
petition
for
retraining
order.
about
two
hours
later,
mr.
robinson
had
delivered
to
the
clerk
of
court
of
the
district
court
a
request
for
a
restraining
order
and
then
for
a
hearing
under
242.
the
--
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
at
3
o'clock
--
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
yes,
he
did
at
3
o'clock
or
3:15,
he
came
there
on
january
7.
yes.
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
at
that
hearing,
he
would
not
go
through
a
hearing
on
such
short
notice.
one,
he
had
prepared
and
two,
he
was
entitled
to
a
fair
hearing
than
this
hearing.
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
now,
that
would
be
in
connection
with
the
application
for
the
restraining
order.
i
believe
that
is
found
at
page
3
and
4,
i
believe
of
the
petition
for
injunctive
relief
and
then
the
amended
--
yes,
at
page
5,
6,
7,
8
of
the
amended
petition
for
injunctive
relief.
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
of
the
appendix.
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
5,
6,
7,
8
of
the
appendix
as
a
more
detailed
and
amended
statement
in
which
he
sets
forth
this,
that
he
had
only
15
minutes
notice
and
really
had
no
opportunity
to
consult
with
his
client.
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
as
far
as
i
know
--
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
i
believe
that
is
true
mr.
justice.
i
believe
that
is
true
in
the
initial
hearing,
partly
because
we
were
and
i
identify
myself
with
stanisic,
i
can't
help
it.
we
were
getting
on
a
matter
to
the
hustling
process
and
we
--
under
the
circumstances,
all
we
could
do
is
just
to
ask
for
a
full
hearing.
it
was
apparent
to
us
that
mr.
urbano
and
mr.
petillo,
his
assistant
were
--
had
bias
and
prejudice.
the
deposition
by
the
way
of
mr.
urbano
and
mr.
petillo
appears
in
the
files
of
this
case
which
before
this
court
and
i
think
the
bias
and
prejudice
are
quite
apparent.
it
appeared
again,
again
even
in
the
subsequent
hearings
held
january
25
and
26
at
which
time
mr.
urbano
and
petillo
or
mr.
urbano,
particularly,
took
official
not
judicial
but
official
notice
that
conditions
in
yugoslavia
were
fine
and
that
there
was
a
relaxation
of
tensions
toward
political
refugees.
it
--
on
that
--
in
that
deposition,
it
appears
that
there
was
no
basis
and
fact
whatever
for
this
finding.
in
other
words,
they
took
judicial
notice
of
nothing
and
yet
came
up
with
the
offset
of
what
stanisic
had
been
able
to
show
at
that
hearing
on
january
25
and
26.
it's
--
in
the
course
of
these
--
well,
if
i
may
move
on
then
to
a
statement
of
the
case.
the
--
the
district
court
referred
the
case
back
to
the
district
director
for
a
summary
hearing
on
physical
persecution
under
section
243
(h).
the
district
director
found
no
physical
persecution.
i
underscore
the
word
“physical”
here
which
are
of
course
the
exact
language
of
243
(h).
the
--
and
--
but
he
treated
it
as
a
matter
of
seeking
or
for
request
parole
under
253
(1)
(e)
and
denied
parole.
well,
stanisic
then
asked
the
court
to
review
because
of
the
bias
and
prejudice
of
the
district
director.
the
district
court,
judge
east
refused
to
change
the
order
of
the
district
director
and
then
the
matter
died
at
that
point.
mr.
stanisic
and
his
companion
vucinic
applied
for
a
private
bill
in
congress
and
it
failed
june
1966.
then
at
that
point,
the
district
director
ordered
stanisic
deported
under
and
also
vucinic
deported
and
gave
them
70
hours
notice
to
present
themselves
to
the
district
director
for
deportation
to
yugoslavia,
and
as
i
understand
they
were
to
be
sent
there
in
handcuffs.
the
--
in
the
meantime
however,
section
243
(h)
of
the
statute
had
been
changed.
in
other
words,
the
goalpost
had
been
moved.
no
longer
was
it
physical
persecution
now
it
was
persecution
on
account
of
race,
religion,
or
political
opinion.
it
had
been
broadened
and
we
claimed
that
therefore
the
goalpost
had
been
widened.
and
we
therefore
had
a
greater
right
than
we
had
under
question
of
physical
persecution.
the
district
director
in
the
earlier
proceedings
used
always
the
word
physical
persecution
and
we
claim
that
the
persecution
that
we
were
facing
was
persecution
by
reason
of
religion,
orthodox,
and
political
opinion
namely
chetnik
sympathies,
anti-yugoslav,
and
government
views.
and
whether
physical
persecution
would
result
is
hard
to
say,
although,
we
have
in
our
brief
pointed
out
some
10
different
grounds
upon
which
this
man
could
face
anything
and
it's
a
very
vague
position
that
he
faces
if
he
goes
back.
if
he
sent
back
he
could
face
anything
up
to
the
death
sentence
back
there
and
he
has
been
promised
a
life
imprisonment.
we'd
claim
therefore
the
--
that
the
--
he
has
now
or
had
now
under
the
amended
statute
a
broader
claim
that
he
had
under
the
earliest
statute.
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
october
5,
196
--
october
3,
1965
i
believe
it
is.
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
after
the
first
hearing
--
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
--
and
before
this
first
--
second
matter
arose.
yes.
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
well
--
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
that's
the
issue
in
my
case
cause
that's
--
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
yes.
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
yes,
that's
--
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
that's
right.
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
that's
right.
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
that's
right,
your
honor.
the
--
on
the
second
proceeding,
he
petitioned
for
parole
under
the
statute
section
243
(h),
this
was
denied
by
again,
the
same
district
director,
urbano
and
he
then
presented
them
through
me.
now,
i
appeared
in
this
case
at
this
point
and
i
then
approach
the
united
states
district
court
asking
for
restraining
order
and
cited
number
of
grounds,
pointing
out
among
other
things
that
the
ship
had
long
since
left
the
shores
and
that
he
should
be
entitled
a
242
hearing
before
a
special
inquiry
officer.
it
is
the
court
rejected
on
the
ground
of
res
judicata.
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
ninth
circuit
reversed
on
the
ground
that
basically
interpret
of
the
statute
that
when
the
ship
departs
the
need
for
haste
ends
and
that
he
is
therefore
entitled
to
a
full
hearing
on
the
merits
of
the
case.
and
then
--
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
--
that's
the
real
issue
of
this
case.
yes.
that
is
right,
your
honor.
the
point
that
i
think
is
critical
in
this
case
which
certainly
strength
is
my
position,
is
the
protocol
related
to
the
status
of
refugees
which
was
ratified
november
1,
1968
about
90
days
ago.
and
this,
i
believe
applies
to
stanisic
and
to
all
other
refugee
seaman
as
well
as
refugees
in
general.
no
longer
can
they
be
sent
back
on
the
ship
that
brought
them.
in
fact,
they
cannot
be
sent
back
to
the
country
from
which
they
are
seeking
refuge
or
seeking
it
from
which
they
are
seeking
asylum.
the
--
in
fact
no
political
refugee
under
this
protocol
as
i
understand
it,
can
be
sent
back
at
all
to
the
country
of
origin
or
the
country
that
is
threatening
to
persecute
him
and
therefore,
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case
it
appears
to
me
that
stanisic
in
no
event
would
be
sent
back
to
yugoslavia,
no
event
of
course
back
on
the
ship
that
brought
him.
and
--
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
yes.
yes,
it
has
mr.
chief
justice.
and
so,
this
is
our
position
that
the
summary
expulsion
proceedings
should
be
limited
to
the
absconding
seaman
who
has
no
claim
of
right.
where
there
is
however
a
claim
of
right
as
in
this
case,
he
is
entitled
to
a
full
and
fair
hearing
on
the
facts
with
full
right
of
appeal.
this
is
the
minimum
of
due
process
in
my
opinion
under
the
treaty
and
the
constitution
and
the
cases.
if
stanisic
is
denied
this
then
he
faces
a
severe
punishment
probably
life
imprisonment,
all
we
ask
is
fairness.
the
--
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
oh,
yes,
i
do
believe
the
statute
also
entitles
us
to
this
but
i
simply
said
that
protocol
has
reinforced
our
position
in
that
it
says
that
all
refugees
shall
be
given
due
process.
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
that
--
there's
of
course
the
first
factual
question
as
the
claim
of
right
to
question,
that
is
true
your
honor.
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
well,
perhaps
i've
been
unduly
impressed
by
the
protocol
that
may
be
part
of
the
point.
the
--
and
the
protocol
came
part
of
that
later
in
terms
of
statutory
enactment
and
so
on
in
the
chronology
of
events.
but
the
--
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
oh,
i
wouldn't
go
--
i
would
say
the
protocol
reinforces
our
position.
i
think
--
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
now
--
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
now,
for
refugee,
political
or
--
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
it
may
be
a
--
it
may
be
if
the
statute
will
have
to
be
declared
at
least
modified
or
declared
unconstitutional
to
the
extent
that
it
conflicts
with
the
protocol.
this
may
be
the
position
but
even
if
we
stay
under
242
on
the
statute
and
i'm
probably
willing
to
stay
on
to
that
as
well.
the
point
there
is
that
he
is
entitled
to
a
full
242
hearing
because
he
--
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
yes.
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
yes.
i
believe
the
protocol
would
control.
it
was
not
--
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
to
yugoslavia.
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
that
is
right
your
honor.
i
believe
that's
correct.
now
that's
a
something
that
has
come
into
be
in
the
last
90
days
or
so.
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
well,
i
believe
that
even
without
the
protocol,
my
whole
--
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
perhaps
i
don't,
i
just
--
out
of
abundance
of
caution,
i
don't
--
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
yes.
i
--
i
think
that
the
protocol
requires
that
he
be
given
due
process.
i
think
242
provides
due
process
and
this
is
what
we're
asking
that
a
--
when
the
protocol
refers
to
due
process,
i
believe
that
this
in
turn
requires
a
due
process
242
hearing
which
is
--
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
i
can
just
cite
the
court
back
to
the
--
well,
to
the
race
case
of
this
court
and
the
--
i
think
for
instance
of
the
woodby
case
in
which
the
court
said
that,
no
deportation
order,
this
woodby
versus
u.s.
i've
cited
in
page
13,
14
of
my
brief,
no
deportation
order
may
be
entered
unless
it
is
found
by
clear,
unequivocal
and
convincing
evidence
that
the
facts
alleged
as
grounds
for
deportation
are
true.
and
that
this
standard
of
proof
applies
to
all
deportation
cases
regardless
of
the
length
of
time
the
alien
has
resided
in
this
country.
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
yes.
we
also
challenge
the
findings
of
the
district
director,
we
do
that
because
the
depositions
of
urbano
and
petillo
which
are
in
the
records
indicate
that
they
--
in
our
opinion
that
they
came
to
this
whole
question
with
prejudice.
and
there's
no
evidence
at
all
contradicting
--
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
yes.
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
yes,
we
are.
we
challenge
the
findings
also
not
only
the
question
of
the
--
we
believe
this
would
come
out
better
in
a
242
hearing
on
the
merits
of
the
case.
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
242
(b),
i
believe
it
is.
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
that's
correct,
your
honor.
yes.
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
if
possible,
have
the
hearing
before
the
ship
left
but
in
any
event,
i
know
in
a
question
of
bona
fide
claim
of
right.
i
think
he
is
entitled
to
a
242
hearing
if
the
sio,
special
inquiry
officer
is
on
hand
at
the
time.
you
could
have
it
right
then,
although,
i
don't
see
how,
when
to
prepare
a
case
like
this
which
requires
witnesses
and
written
records
and
other
things
to
sustain
his
position.
i
don't
see
how
you
get
that
up
in
24
hours.
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
that's
--
regulations
253
--
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
yes.
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
yes.
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
well,
where
he
has
a
claim
of
right,
yes.
although,
i
--
does
the
court
has
a
word
that
he
wouldn't
have
stated
any
claim
of
right
as
i
understand
the
further
question,
is
that
right?
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
yes.
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
yes.
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
i
believe
he
did
in
just
that
many
sentences
that
he
couldn't
go
back
for
reasons
of
religious
and
political
persecution.
but
--
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
i
believe
it
does,
your
honor.
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
he
refused
to
put
on
the
evidence
that
is
true.
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
no,
about
the
16th
of
january
when
the
ship
went.
i'd
like
to
say,
i
see
that
the
light
has
lit
now.
i
just
want
to
take
a
moment
to
explain
this
253
matter.
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
oh!
well,
we
--
the
253
--
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
the
253,
the
record
is
a
regulation,
it's
set
forth
at
the
end
of
the
government's
brief,
page
46
of
the
government's
brief.
the
history
of
this
is
set
forth
rather
neatly
in
the
brief
of
the
amicus
and
particularly,
well
beginning
with
page
5
and
following
on
the
brief
of
mr.
ennis.
the
gist
of
the
argument
is
that
253
is
a
regulatory
or
immigration
service
clause
and
is
not
required
by
the
statute,
and
under
243
(h)
as
government
counsel
have
indicated
there
is
no
procedures
set
forth.
we
claim
that
242
proceedings
apply
namely
a
special
inquiry
officer
hearing
and
for
that
reason
they
--
the
regulatory
that
is
the
regulations
253
hearing
should
be
stricken.
they
are
not
necessary
at
all
and
it's
a
--
it's
this
which
is
doing
the
damage
in
the
case.
one
part
also
i
want
to
bring
up
and
that
is
the
point
of
that
we're
talking
about
de
minimis
matter
here.
as
far
as
--
now,
over
the
last
10
years,
there
have
been
only
276
yugoslav
seamen
involved.
i
pick
up
yugoslav
seamen
because
they
are
the
primary
ones
from
refugee
countries
that
is
--
countries
where
they
might
persecution.
there
may
be
seamen
from
england
and
other
place
but
they're
not
claiming
political
asylum.
the
276
over
10-year
period,
27.6
men
per
year
on
an
average,
that
is
the
only
additional
burden
that
would
be
inflicted
upon
the
staff
of
the
special
inquiry
officer
if
the
court
throws
out
253
as
a
regulatory
provision
and
then
permits
these
refugee
seamen
to
have
a
full
sio
hearing.
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
even
if
the
ship
is
still
on
port
but
in
my
case,
we
don't
have
that
question
and
the
question
which
is
--
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
yes.
yes,
we
did.
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
yes.
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
yes.
although,
there's
a
question
further
added,
may
it
please
the
court
that
after
the
ship
has
gone,
the
hearings
should
shift
from
a
253
hearing
to
a
242
hearing
and
before
a
special
inquiry
officer
because
now
the
need
for
haste
is
gone.
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
yes,
we
did.
yes.
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
yes,
we
did.
yes.
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
no,
your
honor.
we
still
stand
on
the
242
hearing.
we
still
--
i
think
that
is
the
only
correct
procedure.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
yes.
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
yes
and
no.
the
--
we
asked
initially
for
a
hearing
on
--
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
the
request
was
made
before
the
hearing
was
after
the
boat
had
left.
the
request
was
made
on
january
7
for
a
242
hearing.
the
district
court
referred
the
case
on
this
petition
for
injunctive
relief
referred
the
case
back
to
the
same
district
director
for
a
hearing
under
253
on
physical
persecution
and
it
was
253
hearing
not
a
242
hearing
held
about
10
days
after
the
ship
had
left,
and
this
was
ordered
some
10
days
after
the
ship
had
left.
so,
the
timing
is
or
the
hearing
itself
was
held
after
the
ship
had
gone.
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
yes.
yes,
yes.
i
might
add
--
may
i
just
--
well,
i
shall
--
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
just
one
point
in
the
protocol
that
has
been
referred
to
by
the
--
just
points
out
with
reference
to
who
is
a
refugee.
i
refer
the
court
to
page
30
of
the
brief
for
respondent
in
the
terms
of
a
protocol.
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
bernhard
fedde
from
portland,
oregon
and
this
story
--
this
case
is
a
story
of
a
seaman
who
is
trying
to
comply
with
the
law.
he
is
not
a
deserting
seaman
trying
to
evade
the
law.
i
think
that
makes
a
major
difference
in
this
case.
the
question
which
i
believe
is
before
this
court
is
whether
an
alien
merchant
seaman
who
enters
this
country
on
a
d-1
landing
permit
is
entitled
to
an
impartial
hearing
before
an
independent
and
impartial
administrative
judge
on
his
bona
fide
claim
of
right
to
stay
here
to
escape
prosecution.
now,
as
i
originally
phrase
this
question,
i
insert
the
words
after
his
ship
sails.
i'm
not
sure
now
after
reading
the
brief
of
mr.
ennis'
amicus
in
the
--
of
the
american
civil
liberties
of
union
whether
i
need
to
insert
that
any
longer.
in
light
of
the
treaty
which
provides
--
which
protects
refugees
and
deserting
seaman,
all
the
deserting
seaman
chapter
applies
only
in
that
treaty
or
protocol
applies
only
to
seaman,
foreign
seaman
flying
in
our
case
under
the
american
flag.
i
believe
therefore
the
question
really
boils
down
to
this
and
our
theory
is
that
a
seaman
with
a
bona
fide
claim
of
right
is
entitle
to
a
plenary
hearing
with
full
right
of
appeal
under
section
242
in
light
of
the
new
treaty
and
to
the
constitution
and
laws
and
cases.
that's
our
position.
i'd
like
to
state
briefly
and
enlarge
upon
a
statement
of
facts.
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
no.
it
was
on
the
ground
that
he
had,
i
believe
it
was
the
question
of
statutory
interpretation
after
the
ship
had
sailed.
i
believe
that
was
the
narrower
question
which
was
presented.
i
believe
that
as
i
have
stated
it's
a
broader
question
mr.
chief
justice
and
that
the
--
this
would
--
i
have
stated
now,
it
may
not
be
necessary
for
my
case
but
i
believe
that
is
necessary
for
the
court
each
case
which
is
the
one
which
mr.
ennis
in
the
amicus
brief
is
supporting.
but
i
believe
that
as
stated
now
it
would
be
adequate
to
cover
both
and
i
have
grown
to
this
conclusion
as
i
have
been
pondering
the
statute
and
the
cases.
now
first
of
all,
the
government
has
pointed
as
argued
that
we
had
not
protested
the
revocation
of
the
landing
permit.
the
facts
are
that
stanisic
with
a
valid
landing
permit
on
january
6,
1965
sought
out
the
immigration
service
and
presented
to
the
immigration
service
a
claim
of
asylum
before
his
expi
--
before
his
landing
permit
had
been
revoked.
there
was
--
he
was
making
at
and
he
had
10
days
to
go
really
as
far
as
it
turned
out,
as
far
as
the
ship
was
concerned.
the
ship
was
around
for
another
10
or
more
days.
he
sought
asylum.
did
he
have
reason?
yes,
30
out
45
members
of
his
family
which
was
a
chetnik
yugoslav
family
have
been
executed
or
killed
in
the
course
of
world
war
ii
and
the
war
immediately
following.
his
own
father,
who
was
an
orthodox
priest's
assistant,
had
been
deprived
of
his
church
function
and
had
been
deprived
of
his
pension
rights,
and
was
living
a
borderline
starvation
life
in
yugoslavia.
the
--
he
himself
stanisic
in
1957,
had
tried
to
escape
from
yugoslavia.
he
was
caught
by
some
fisherman
just
outside
the
(inaudible).
he
was
brought
back
and
then
was
threatened
with
life
imprisonment
by
a
court
man.
now,
this
doesn't
comport
with
my
idea
of
fairness
and
due
process
when
the
court
in
advance
of
the
next
defense
announces
what
he's
going
to
do.
they
said,
“you're
going
to
have
life
imprisonment
the
next
time
you
appear
before
this
court.”
this
is
why
this
--
in
my
opinion
is
a
serious
case
of
a
claim
of
bona
fide
right
of
asylum.
i
think
this
makes
every
difference
in
the
world.
now,
--
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
no.
they
were
not
--
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
we
have
15
minutes
notice.
the
--
in
--
on
the
bottom
of
page
3
of
my
brief,
the
respondent's
brief
is
a
--
an
excerpt
from
an
affidavit
of
mr.
robinson
who
was
at
that
time
counsel
for
stanisic
to
outline
the
exact
chronology
of
events.
stanisic
appeared
on
january
6
and
asked
for
asylum.
he
was
taken
to
rocky
butte
jail
in
portland.
on
january
7,
he
was
told
that
--
he
was
asked
by
the
immigration
officials
without
the
benefit
of
any
counsel,
“do
you
intend
to
return
to
your
ship?”
this
of
course
is
the
trick
question.
he
didn't
know
what
was
the
--
he
just
answered
honestly,
“no,
i
don't.”
and
then
they
said,
“your
landing
permit
is
revoked.”
he
had
announced
that
he
was
coming
there
for
asylum,
then
is
subsequently
his
landing
permit
was
revoked
and
then
it
was
that
12
--
at
11
o'clock
some
members
on
january
7,
the
day
after
he
had
appealed
for
asylum.
members
of
his
family,
toskovic
actually
came
to
mr.
robinson's
office
and
said,
“we
need
help.”
mr.
robinson
was
in
of
the
court
at
that
time.
he
announced
--
however
he
filed
a
formal
appearance
about
12
o'clock
that
day
one
hour
later.
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
january
7th,
still
the
same
day.
we
are
now
45
minutes
later.
this
is
all
working
on
split-second
timing
and
then
--
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
january
7,
the
day
after
he
was
first
--
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
--
he
first
made
his
claim.
yes,
that's
right.
he
had
still
not
seen
any
lawyer
until
--
no,
stanisic
had
not
seen
any
lawyer
but
his
uncle
or
cousin
toskovic
had
on
the
following
day,
january
7
about
11
a.m.
at
12
o'clock,
robinson
filed
his
appearance
and
went
to
another
court
where
he
had
to
be
it
1:30.
at
3
o'clock
that
day,
he
got
a
telephone
call
from
the
immigration
service
saying,
“you
are
due
to
have
your
hearing
on
the
question
of
asylum
in
15
minutes.”
robinson
couldn't
prepare
any
case
in
that
short
order
and
the
--
mr.
urbano
who
was
then
the
district
director,
simply
insisted
that
the
matter
proceed
at
once
and
it
was
then
that
mr.
robinson
said,
“we
can't
proceed
and
we're
not
going
to
present
any
evidence.
in
fact
we
demand
a
242
hearing.”
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
yes,
it
is.
well,
it
--
yes,
it
is.
it's
in
the
record.
you
see
it's
a
--
i
don't
know
if
could
find
it
on
spur
of
the
moment
like
this.
it's
in
the
--
well,
it's
in
this
on
page
3
an
affidavit
of
mr.
robinson
where
to
some
of
this
appears.
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
yes,
i
think
it
is.
it's
--
perhaps
not,
i
would
--
i
should
perhaps
move
to
have
that
extended
then
and
have
the
record
extended
to
include
this
affidavit
of
mr.
robinson.
i
believe
that
the
affidavit
appears
in
the
proceedings
in
the
entire
file
which
was
sent
up
to
the
court.
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
that
was
filed
january
7,
1965
in
connection
with
the
petition
for
restraining
order
which
mr.
robinson
then
prepared
that
same
day.
i'm
sure
it's
in
the
record
because
--
yes,
it
is.
it's
in
connection
with
petition
for
retraining
order.
about
two
hours
later,
mr.
robinson
had
delivered
to
the
clerk
of
court
of
the
district
court
a
request
for
a
restraining
order
and
then
for
a
hearing
under
242.
the
--
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
at
3
o'clock
--
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
yes,
he
did
at
3
o'clock
or
3:15,
he
came
there
on
january
7.
yes.
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
at
that
hearing,
he
would
not
go
through
a
hearing
on
such
short
notice.
one,
he
had
prepared
and
two,
he
was
entitled
to
a
fair
hearing
than
this
hearing.
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
now,
that
would
be
in
connection
with
the
application
for
the
restraining
order.
i
believe
that
is
found
at
page
3
and
4,
i
believe
of
the
petition
for
injunctive
relief
and
then
the
amended
--
yes,
at
page
5,
6,
7,
8
of
the
amended
petition
for
injunctive
relief.
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
of
the
appendix.
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
5,
6,
7,
8
of
the
appendix
as
a
more
detailed
and
amended
statement
in
which
he
sets
forth
this,
that
he
had
only
15
minutes
notice
and
really
had
no
opportunity
to
consult
with
his
client.
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
as
far
as
i
know
--
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
i
believe
that
is
true
mr.
justice.
i
believe
that
is
true
in
the
initial
hearing,
partly
because
we
were
and
i
identify
myself
with
stanisic,
i
can't
help
it.
we
were
getting
on
a
matter
to
the
hustling
process
and
we
--
under
the
circumstances,
all
we
could
do
is
just
to
ask
for
a
full
hearing.
it
was
apparent
to
us
that
mr.
urbano
and
mr.
petillo,
his
assistant
were
--
had
bias
and
prejudice.
the
deposition
by
the
way
of
mr.
urbano
and
mr.
petillo
appears
in
the
files
of
this
case
which
before
this
court
and
i
think
the
bias
and
prejudice
are
quite
apparent.
it
appeared
again,
again
even
in
the
subsequent
hearings
held
january
25
and
26
at
which
time
mr.
urbano
and
petillo
or
mr.
urbano,
particularly,
took
official
not
judicial
but
official
notice
that
conditions
in
yugoslavia
were
fine
and
that
there
was
a
relaxation
of
tensions
toward
political
refugees.
it
--
on
that
--
in
that
deposition,
it
appears
that
there
was
no
basis
and
fact
whatever
for
this
finding.
in
other
words,
they
took
judicial
notice
of
nothing
and
yet
came
up
with
the
offset
of
what
stanisic
had
been
able
to
show
at
that
hearing
on
january
25
and
26.
it's
--
in
the
course
of
these
--
well,
if
i
may
move
on
then
to
a
statement
of
the
case.
the
--
the
district
court
referred
the
case
back
to
the
district
director
for
a
summary
hearing
on
physical
persecution
under
section
243
(h).
the
district
director
found
no
physical
persecution.
i
underscore
the
word
“physical”
here
which
are
of
course
the
exact
language
of
243
(h).
the
--
and
--
but
he
treated
it
as
a
matter
of
seeking
or
for
request
parole
under
253
(1)
(e)
and
denied
parole.
well,
stanisic
then
asked
the
court
to
review
because
of
the
bias
and
prejudice
of
the
district
director.
the
district
court,
judge
east
refused
to
change
the
order
of
the
district
director
and
then
the
matter
died
at
that
point.
mr.
stanisic
and
his
companion
vucinic
applied
for
a
private
bill
in
congress
and
it
failed
june
1966.
then
at
that
point,
the
district
director
ordered
stanisic
deported
under
and
also
vucinic
deported
and
gave
them
70
hours
notice
to
present
themselves
to
the
district
director
for
deportation
to
yugoslavia,
and
as
i
understand
they
were
to
be
sent
there
in
handcuffs.
the
--
in
the
meantime
however,
section
243
(h)
of
the
statute
had
been
changed.
in
other
words,
the
goalpost
had
been
moved.
no
longer
was
it
physical
persecution
now
it
was
persecution
on
account
of
race,
religion,
or
political
opinion.
it
had
been
broadened
and
we
claimed
that
therefore
the
goalpost
had
been
widened.
and
we
therefore
had
a
greater
right
than
we
had
under
question
of
physical
persecution.
the
district
director
in
the
earlier
proceedings
used
always
the
word
physical
persecution
and
we
claim
that
the
persecution
that
we
were
facing
was
persecution
by
reason
of
religion,
orthodox,
and
political
opinion
namely
chetnik
sympathies,
anti-yugoslav,
and
government
views.
and
whether
physical
persecution
would
result
is
hard
to
say,
although,
we
have
in
our
brief
pointed
out
some
10
different
grounds
upon
which
this
man
could
face
anything
and
it's
a
very
vague
position
that
he
faces
if
he
goes
back.
if
he
sent
back
he
could
face
anything
up
to
the
death
sentence
back
there
and
he
has
been
promised
a
life
imprisonment.
we'd
claim
therefore
the
--
that
the
--
he
has
now
or
had
now
under
the
amended
statute
a
broader
claim
that
he
had
under
the
earliest
statute.
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
october
5,
196
--
october
3,
1965
i
believe
it
is.
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
after
the
first
hearing
--
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
--
and
before
this
first
--
second
matter
arose.
yes.
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
well
--
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
that's
the
issue
in
my
case
cause
that's
--
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
yes.
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
yes,
that's
--
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
that's
right.
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
that's
right.
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
that's
right,
your
honor.
the
--
on
the
second
proceeding,
he
petitioned
for
parole
under
the
statute
section
243
(h),
this
was
denied
by
again,
the
same
district
director,
urbano
and
he
then
presented
them
through
me.
now,
i
appeared
in
this
case
at
this
point
and
i
then
approach
the
united
states
district
court
asking
for
restraining
order
and
cited
number
of
grounds,
pointing
out
among
other
things
that
the
ship
had
long
since
left
the
shores
and
that
he
should
be
entitled
a
242
hearing
before
a
special
inquiry
officer.
it
is
the
court
rejected
on
the
ground
of
res
judicata.
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
ninth
circuit
reversed
on
the
ground
that
basically
interpret
of
the
statute
that
when
the
ship
departs
the
need
for
haste
ends
and
that
he
is
therefore
entitled
to
a
full
hearing
on
the
merits
of
the
case.
and
then
--
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
--
that's
the
real
issue
of
this
case.
yes.
that
is
right,
your
honor.
the
point
that
i
think
is
critical
in
this
case
which
certainly
strength
is
my
position,
is
the
protocol
related
to
the
status
of
refugees
which
was
ratified
november
1,
1968
about
90
days
ago.
and
this,
i
believe
applies
to
stanisic
and
to
all
other
refugee
seaman
as
well
as
refugees
in
general.
no
longer
can
they
be
sent
back
on
the
ship
that
brought
them.
in
fact,
they
cannot
be
sent
back
to
the
country
from
which
they
are
seeking
refuge
or
seeking
it
from
which
they
are
seeking
asylum.
the
--
in
fact
no
political
refugee
under
this
protocol
as
i
understand
it,
can
be
sent
back
at
all
to
the
country
of
origin
or
the
country
that
is
threatening
to
persecute
him
and
therefore,
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case
it
appears
to
me
that
stanisic
in
no
event
would
be
sent
back
to
yugoslavia,
no
event
of
course
back
on
the
ship
that
brought
him.
and
--
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
yes.
yes,
it
has
mr.
chief
justice.
and
so,
this
is
our
position
that
the
summary
expulsion
proceedings
should
be
limited
to
the
absconding
seaman
who
has
no
claim
of
right.
where
there
is
however
a
claim
of
right
as
in
this
case,
he
is
entitled
to
a
full
and
fair
hearing
on
the
facts
with
full
right
of
appeal.
this
is
the
minimum
of
due
process
in
my
opinion
under
the
treaty
and
the
constitution
and
the
cases.
if
stanisic
is
denied
this
then
he
faces
a
severe
punishment
probably
life
imprisonment,
all
we
ask
is
fairness.
the
--
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
oh,
yes,
i
do
believe
the
statute
also
entitles
us
to
this
but
i
simply
said
that
protocol
has
reinforced
our
position
in
that
it
says
that
all
refugees
shall
be
given
due
process.
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
that
--
there's
of
course
the
first
factual
question
as
the
claim
of
right
to
question,
that
is
true
your
honor.
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
well,
perhaps
i've
been
unduly
impressed
by
the
protocol
that
may
be
part
of
the
point.
the
--
and
the
protocol
came
part
of
that
later
in
terms
of
statutory
enactment
and
so
on
in
the
chronology
of
events.
but
the
--
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
oh,
i
wouldn't
go
--
i
would
say
the
protocol
reinforces
our
position.
i
think
--
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
now
--
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
now,
for
refugee,
political
or
--
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
it
may
be
a
--
it
may
be
if
the
statute
will
have
to
be
declared
at
least
modified
or
declared
unconstitutional
to
the
extent
that
it
conflicts
with
the
protocol.
this
may
be
the
position
but
even
if
we
stay
under
242
on
the
statute
and
i'm
probably
willing
to
stay
on
to
that
as
well.
the
point
there
is
that
he
is
entitled
to
a
full
242
hearing
because
he
--
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
yes.
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
yes.
i
believe
the
protocol
would
control.
it
was
not
--
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
to
yugoslavia.
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
that
is
right
your
honor.
i
believe
that's
correct.
now
that's
a
something
that
has
come
into
be
in
the
last
90
days
or
so.
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
well,
i
believe
that
even
without
the
protocol,
my
whole
--
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
perhaps
i
don't,
i
just
--
out
of
abundance
of
caution,
i
don't
--
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
yes.
i
--
i
think
that
the
protocol
requires
that
he
be
given
due
process.
i
think
242
provides
due
process
and
this
is
what
we're
asking
that
a
--
when
the
protocol
refers
to
due
process,
i
believe
that
this
in
turn
requires
a
due
process
242
hearing
which
is
--
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
i
can
just
cite
the
court
back
to
the
--
well,
to
the
race
case
of
this
court
and
the
--
i
think
for
instance
of
the
woodby
case
in
which
the
court
said
that,
no
deportation
order,
this
woodby
versus
u.s.
i've
cited
in
page
13,
14
of
my
brief,
no
deportation
order
may
be
entered
unless
it
is
found
by
clear,
unequivocal
and
convincing
evidence
that
the
facts
alleged
as
grounds
for
deportation
are
true.
and
that
this
standard
of
proof
applies
to
all
deportation
cases
regardless
of
the
length
of
time
the
alien
has
resided
in
this
country.
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
yes.
we
also
challenge
the
findings
of
the
district
director,
we
do
that
because
the
depositions
of
urbano
and
petillo
which
are
in
the
records
indicate
that
they
--
in
our
opinion
that
they
came
to
this
whole
question
with
prejudice.
and
there's
no
evidence
at
all
contradicting
--
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
yes.
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
yes,
we
are.
we
challenge
the
findings
also
not
only
the
question
of
the
--
we
believe
this
would
come
out
better
in
a
242
hearing
on
the
merits
of
the
case.
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
242
(b),
i
believe
it
is.
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
that's
correct,
your
honor.
yes.
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
if
possible,
have
the
hearing
before
the
ship
left
but
in
any
event,
i
know
in
a
question
of
bona
fide
claim
of
right.
i
think
he
is
entitled
to
a
242
hearing
if
the
sio,
special
inquiry
officer
is
on
hand
at
the
time.
you
could
have
it
right
then,
although,
i
don't
see
how,
when
to
prepare
a
case
like
this
which
requires
witnesses
and
written
records
and
other
things
to
sustain
his
position.
i
don't
see
how
you
get
that
up
in
24
hours.
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
that's
--
regulations
253
--
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
yes.
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
yes.
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
well,
where
he
has
a
claim
of
right,
yes.
although,
i
--
does
the
court
has
a
word
that
he
wouldn't
have
stated
any
claim
of
right
as
i
understand
the
further
question,
is
that
right?
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
yes.
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
yes.
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
i
believe
he
did
in
just
that
many
sentences
that
he
couldn't
go
back
for
reasons
of
religious
and
political
persecution.
but
--
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
i
believe
it
does,
your
honor.
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
he
refused
to
put
on
the
evidence
that
is
true.
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
no,
about
the
16th
of
january
when
the
ship
went.
i'd
like
to
say,
i
see
that
the
light
has
lit
now.
i
just
want
to
take
a
moment
to
explain
this
253
matter.
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
oh!
well,
we
--
the
253
--
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
the
253,
the
record
is
a
regulation,
it's
set
forth
at
the
end
of
the
government's
brief,
page
46
of
the
government's
brief.
the
history
of
this
is
set
forth
rather
neatly
in
the
brief
of
the
amicus
and
particularly,
well
beginning
with
page
5
and
following
on
the
brief
of
mr.
ennis.
the
gist
of
the
argument
is
that
253
is
a
regulatory
or
immigration
service
clause
and
is
not
required
by
the
statute,
and
under
243
(h)
as
government
counsel
have
indicated
there
is
no
procedures
set
forth.
we
claim
that
242
proceedings
apply
namely
a
special
inquiry
officer
hearing
and
for
that
reason
they
--
the
regulatory
that
is
the
regulations
253
hearing
should
be
stricken.
they
are
not
necessary
at
all
and
it's
a
--
it's
this
which
is
doing
the
damage
in
the
case.
one
part
also
i
want
to
bring
up
and
that
is
the
point
of
that
we're
talking
about
de
minimis
matter
here.
as
far
as
--
now,
over
the
last
10
years,
there
have
been
only
276
yugoslav
seamen
involved.
i
pick
up
yugoslav
seamen
because
they
are
the
primary
ones
from
refugee
countries
that
is
--
countries
where
they
might
persecution.
there
may
be
seamen
from
england
and
other
place
but
they're
not
claiming
political
asylum.
the
276
over
10-year
period,
27.6
men
per
year
on
an
average,
that
is
the
only
additional
burden
that
would
be
inflicted
upon
the
staff
of
the
special
inquiry
officer
if
the
court
throws
out
253
as
a
regulatory
provision
and
then
permits
these
refugee
seamen
to
have
a
full
sio
hearing.
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
even
if
the
ship
is
still
on
port
but
in
my
case,
we
don't
have
that
question
and
the
question
which
is
--
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
yes.
yes,
we
did.
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
yes.
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
yes.
although,
there's
a
question
further
added,
may
it
please
the
court
that
after
the
ship
has
gone,
the
hearings
should
shift
from
a
253
hearing
to
a
242
hearing
and
before
a
special
inquiry
officer
because
now
the
need
for
haste
is
gone.
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
yes,
we
did.
yes.
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
yes,
we
did.
yes.
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
no,
your
honor.
we
still
stand
on
the
242
hearing.
we
still
--
i
think
that
is
the
only
correct
procedure.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
yes.
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
yes
and
no.
the
--
we
asked
initially
for
a
hearing
on
--
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
the
request
was
made
before
the
hearing
was
after
the
boat
had
left.
the
request
was
made
on
january
7
for
a
242
hearing.
the
district
court
referred
the
case
on
this
petition
for
injunctive
relief
referred
the
case
back
to
the
same
district
director
for
a
hearing
under
253
on
physical
persecution
and
it
was
253
hearing
not
a
242
hearing
held
about
10
days
after
the
ship
had
left,
and
this
was
ordered
some
10
days
after
the
ship
had
left.
so,
the
timing
is
or
the
hearing
itself
was
held
after
the
ship
had
gone.
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
yes.
yes,
yes.
i
might
add
--
may
i
just
--
well,
i
shall
--
mr.
g.
bernhard
fedde
just
one
point
in
the
protocol
that
has
been
referred
to
by
the
--
just
points
out
with
reference
to
who
is
a
refugee.
i
refer
the
court
to
page
30
of
the
brief
for
respondent
in
the
terms
of
a
protocol.
