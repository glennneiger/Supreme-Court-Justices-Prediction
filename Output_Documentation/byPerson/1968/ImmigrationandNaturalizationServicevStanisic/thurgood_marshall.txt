justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
isn't
it
also
true
if
he
says,
he's
going
back
on
another
ship,
he
gets
a
full
hearing?
justice
thurgood
marshall
suppose
he
stayed
two
months?
justice
thurgood
marshall
uh-huh.
justice
thurgood
marshall
there's
two
--
these
two
months
you
got
the
same
summary
treatment?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
your
position?
justice
thurgood
marshall
suppose
he
is
here
one
hour
after
the
ship
leaves?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
do
you
think?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
his
rights
are
determined
by
how
long
the
ship
being
around?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
think
that
what's
congress
think?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
he
--
did
the
lawyer
ever
go
to
the
immigration
authorities
that
day?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
what
happened
then?
he
said,
he
wouldn't
go
through
at
the
hearing?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
you
say
that
they
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
what
worries
me
is
that
admittedly
i
would
assume
the
lawyer
was
in
trouble
but
the
petitioner
here,
rather
respondent
didn't
need
15
minutes.
he
knew
what
he
was
--
his
complaint
was.
i
would
assume
that
he'd
been
thinking
about
this
for
quite
awhile.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
would
say
they
think
about
it
is
since
the
time
they
threatened
him
with
life
imprisonment
at
least.
but
what
worries
me
is
that
nobody
gave
the
office
the
--
any
indication
of
what
the
facts
were
that
they
wanted
a
hearing
to
develop,
is
that
true?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
mean--
justice
thurgood
marshall
even
if
the
ship
is
still
on
port?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
did
you
do?
you
filed
your
case
in
the
district
court
while
the
(inaudible)
while
the
ship
is
still
in
port?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
what
you've
meant
that
anytime
that
his
ship
had
gone
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
anytime?
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
your
application
of
restraining
order,
didn't
you
have
242
hearing?
justice
thurgood
marshall
while
the
ship
is
still
in
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
changed
that
just
now?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
they
also
suggest
that
you
tell
us
that
they
gave
him
more
than
15
minutes
to
get
ready?
