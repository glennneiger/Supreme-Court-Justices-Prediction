mr.
ellis
e.
reid
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
basically,
to
begin
i'd
like
to
point
out
and
quote
from
the
page
8
of
my
brief
“legitimate
political
expression
intended
to
secure
changes
in
society's
legal,
political,
social,
or
economic
structure.
frequently,
takes
the
form
of
expressions
about
future
events
or
conditions
such
expression
may
be
in
the
form
of
promises,
predictions,
or
warnings,
or
threats
of
an
unlawful
--
threats
of
lawful
action.
now,
apparently
the
basis
of
this
appeal
is
that
the
court
below
deemed
it
inappropriate
to
circumscribe
a
threat
of
miniscule
illegal
activity
but
what
we
have
here
is
really
a
collision
between
the
right
of
certain
individuals
in
this
society
to
exercise
what
has
been
historical
and
classical
first
amendment
freedoms
and
the
right
of
a
state
to
protect
itself
and
to
protect
the
order
of
liberty
which
--
without
which
we
would
not
have
any
freedom
of
speech.
so,
we've
always
--
we
always
do
have
a
conflict
in
this
area
and
this
court
has
in
many
--
on
many
occasions
try
to
resolve
a
conflict
but
now
we
have
a
statute
before
this
court
which
the
state
contends
is
an
extortion
statute
in
the
classic
sense,
it
is
not.
this
statute
does
not
require
the
defendant
to
take
or
to
attempt
to
take
anything
of
value
from
the
purported
victim.
i
say
it's
not
an
extortion
statute.
it
is
overbroad
and
extortion
statute
could've
been
drawn
to
protect
a
state
against
that
evil
and
in
fact,
you
have
section
(a)
(1)
of
that
statute
which
is
not
here
on
appeal
and
which
would
remain
valid
which
says
of
course
the
threat
of
inflicting
physical
harm
on
the
person
threatened
or
any
other
person
or
on
property.
now,
if
they
want
to
protect
people
from
extortion,
i
say
well,
in
good
the
state
has
an
interest
in
that
which
is
substantial
but
when
you
deal
with
what
they
term
as
the
right
of
a
public
official
to
have
freedom
of
choice,
i
say
you
made
the
statute
so
broad
as
to
really
put
a
five
year
news
or
a
$5,000.00
fine
around
anyone's
neck
would
have
it
to
merit
to
publicly
utter
that
we
will
march
around
mayor
daley's
house
and
violate
let's
say
an
ordinance
which
would
maybe
cause
us
to
pay
a
hundred
dollar
fine
at
the
most.
now,
we
must
face
five
years
in
the
penitentiary
or
pay
a
forfeit
$5,000.00.
this
is
the
real
guts
of
this
particular
case.
the
statute
also
makes
criminal
the
threat
to
commit
a
criminal
offense
without
regard
to
the
degree
of
the
threat.
this
is
the
point
i'm
making.
in
other
words,
if
you
carry
out
the
threat
in
its
final
analysis
and
its
one
to
violate
a
misdemeanor
and
it
will
be
punishable
only
by
fine,
why
then
when
you
take
it
one
step
back
and
say,
i'm
going
to
do
this
tomorrow?
now,
you
face
five
years
in
the
penitentiary.
i
suggest
to
you
that
this
is
the
reason
that
the
court
below
struck
this
particular
portion
of
this
statute.
now,
--
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
yes.
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
that's
correct
and
i
think
that
--
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
that's
correct.
in
other
words,
in
every
form
of
let's
say
direct
action
protest
there
is
always
an
evil
that
you're
trying
to
get
rid
off
or
there
is
always
some
change
in
the
society
that
you're
trying
to
bring
above.
so
i'm
saying
that
this
statute
when
you
take
just
historical
direct
action
protest
it
elevates
what
has
been
the
exposure
of
using
misdemeanors
and
punishment
by
fine
or
short
detention
to
the
area
of
a
felony
and
i
think
that
it
puts
a
chill
on
legitimate
free
expression
of
ideas
and
a
chill
on
the
right
of
individuals
to
determine
that
they
will
do
something
in
a
way
to
bring
about
legitimate
change.
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
well,
in
--
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
yes
in
the
complaint,
we
alleged
a
scheme
and
we
alleged
a
conspiracy
and
alleged
the
chronology
of
events.
but
most
of
which
in
fact
all
of
which
took
place
in
1967.
there
were
a
series
of
mass
arrest
in
chicago
involving
about
three
or
four
incidents
separate
distinct
incidents.
there
are
seven
sub-classes
in
the
total
class
action
presented
to
the
court
below.
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
they
did
not
arrest
anybody
for
the
intimidation
statute
but
we
alleged
they
threatened
to
do
so
and
it
would
be
a
question
of
whether
or
not
we
could
prove
that
they
in
fact
threatened
to
use
this
particular
statute
but
we
were
going
to
prove
that
there
were
meetings
of
officials
and
they
have
set
about
a
scheme
of
high
bonds
and
to
use
everything
at
this
disposal
including
the
statute.
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
i
believe
we
did.
now,
whether
or
not
it
is
a
conclusion
as
my
opposing
counsel
said
i
would
say
that
we
alleged
it
as
a
fact
and
--
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
pursuant
to,
this
is
page
17
of
the
appendix
and
this
is
paragraph
34
of
the
complaint.
pursuant
to
the
aforesaid
plan
or
scheme,
defendants
have
threatened
to
continue
--
no,
strike
that,
have
threatened
and
continue
to
threaten
to
enforce
the
said
unconstitutional,
void
and
illegal
statutes
and
ordinances
against
the
plaintiffs
herein
for
the
sole
purpose
of
arresting,
intimidating,
subjecting
and
causing
to
be
subjected
plaintiffs
and
their
members.
now,
i
suggest
to
you
that
this
statement
met
all
of
the
statutes
including
the
intimidation
statute
and
i
would
like
to
point
out.
i
think
at
the
page
18
also
which
is
paragraph
37
(a)
where
we
alleged
as
a
result
of
those
threats.
now,
we
never
really
dug
down
to
the
factual
issues
because
we
felt
that
we
could
prove
that
there
were
meetings
of
the
chief
judge,
meetings
of
the
states
attorney's
office
and
that
they
had
gone
over
all
of
these
statutes
and
we
didn't
just
pull
the
statutes
on
that.
these
were
the
statutes
that
we
had
on
information
and
believed
that
they
were
going
to
use
in
the
scheme
of
dealing
with
so-called
mass
arrest
situations.
now,
we
alleged
that
threat.
now,
i
--
we
didn't
name
names
or
dates
and
meeting
places
--
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
that's
correct.
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
that's
correct.
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
well,
i
would
suggest
no.
no
one
ever
pointed
a
finger
at
us
and
said
they
were
going
to
do
it
directly
to
us.
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
no,
not
a
direct
threat
by
suggest
to
the
court
that
a
threat
can
be
just
as
ominous
if
it's
indirect
and
it
gets
back
to
you
by
a
third
party
as
if
the
finger
was
pointing
in
your
faces
that
we're
going
to
do
this
to
you.
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
but
the
question
here
is
one
of
standing
in
one
of
chill
and
one
of
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
yes,
but
i
would
--
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
well,
in
golden,
the
language
that
i've
picked
out
of
golden
states
that
the
difference
between
an
abstract
question
and
a
controversy
contemplated
by
the
declaratory
judgment
act
is
necessarily
one
of
degree
and
it
would
be
difficult
if
it
would
be
possible
to
fashion
a
precise
test
for
determining
in
every
case
whether
there
is
such
a
controversy.
basically,
the
question
in
each
case
is
whether
the
facts
alleged
under
all
these
circumstances
show
that
there
is
a
substantial
controversy
between
the
parties
having
adverse
legal
interest
of
sufficient
immediacy
and
reality
to
warrant
the
issuance
of
a
declaratory
judgment.
now,
i'm
asking
this
court
to
take
into
account
the
fact
that
you
have
to
look
at
all
of
the
facts
and
circumstances
as
to
what
is
alleged
in
the
complaint.
here,
we
have
had
experienced
with
the
circumstances
that
we
contend
with
or
that
we
contended
with
in
the
mass
arrest
circumstances.
we
have
under
gone
the
mass
arrest
of
60
people
some
of
which
were
on
their
front
porche.
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
what
is
it
your
honor?
i
didn't
under
the
question.
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
with
the
intimidation
statute
only.
actually,
no
one
was
ever
charged
so
we
had
no
experience
other
than
let's
say
an
indirect
threat
that
the
next
time
around
will
not
only
use
mob-action
but
we're
going
to
use
the
intimidation
statute
as
well.
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
yes.
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
i
would
say
when
--
whether
or
not
the
threat
is
indirect
or
direct
it
is
still
a
threat
and
either
i
am
going
to
be
chilled
in
my
feelings
that
i
can
go
out
and
exert
my
first
amendment
freedoms
or
not.
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
well,
i
would
suggest
this
was
more
than
rumor.
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
yes,
we
were
but
as
a
question
of
degree,
your
honor,
and
i'm
saying
we're
little
bit
closer
to
this
in
to
the
spectrum.
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
what
did
you
say?
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
i
didn't
hear
you.
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
did
we
just
find
statute?
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
well,
you
mean
so
far
as
our
drafting
the
complaint?
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
well,
i
would
suggest
it
didn't
start
from
our
end
as
to
which
statutes
we
were
going
to
sit
down
and
try
to
get
the
court
to
define
to
be
unconstitutional.
i
suggest
that
in
light
of
what
was
happening
and
in
light
of
what
we
felt
was
going
to
happen
to
our
plaintiffs
below
and
appellees
here
that
we
said
in
light
of
these
statutes
where
they
have
already
taken
action
and
we
have
this
history
behind
us
now
and
in
light
of
the
fact
that
we're
being
threatened
in
the
future
by
the
intimidation
statute,
let's
file
a
complaint
taking
care
what
has
gone
before,
the
mob-action,
disorderly
conduct
as
well
as
intimidation
because
we
want
perspective
relief
as
well
as
--
i
mean
you
know
as
well
as
dealing
with
history,
and
then
--
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
that's
correct.
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
well,
i'm
suggesting
to
the
court
that,
your
honors,
and
from
your
question
i
can
take
the
attitude
or
the
idea
from
that
that
you
feel
that
a
police
officer
must
first
come
down
or
a
state's
attorney
and
say,
i'm
going
to
charge
you
ellis
reid.
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
i
understand.
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
that's
correct
and
i
would
--
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
that
is
a
difference.
but
i'm
suggesting
that
even
though
that
is
the
difference
and
i
recognize
that
to
be
a
difference,
i'm
not
trying
to
minimize
that
i'm
saying
when
you
put
you
can't
try
this
case
in
a
vacuum
surely
if
you
said
nothing
else
that
happened
before.
you
might
be
right,
it
would
be
pretty
remote
but
when
you
have
the
chronology
and
the
dealing
with
the
plaintiffs
below
with
the
other
statutes
they
were
in
fact
applied.
i
think
that
they
--
the
threat
became
so
imminent
and
immediate
and
there
wasn't
actual
controversy
between
live
litigants
at
that
point
although
the
indictment
had
not
fall.
and
no
one
had
come
down
to
make
an
arrest.
i
still
think
although
we
were
in
court
perhaps
early
i
don't
think
we
were
in
court
too
early
as
to
make
the
issue
one
that
would
be
not
an
actual
case
of
controversy
and
i'm
asking
you
to
really
look
at
the
factual
circumstance
involving
the
mass
arrest
situation
where
the
use
of
the
statutes
and
we
cannot
divorce
this
statute
from
the
total
scheme
of
things.
i'm
saying,
it's
the
total
scheme
of
things.
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
i
did.
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
no,
they
came
up
on
a
motion
to
dismiss
before
judge
will
alone
and
it
was
denied.
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
that's
correct.
he
felt
that
there
was
subs
--
sufficient
allegations
to
state
a
claim
and
of
course
now
that
point
we
were
not
split
off
between
intimidation
mob-action,
disorderly
conduct
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
--
for
this
arrest.
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
other
than
on
--
in
some
other
circumstances
what
judge
will
termed
as
ad
hoc
hearings
involving
whether
or
not
he
would
enjoin
particular
prosecutions
which
came
at
a
subsequent
point
in
time.
there
were
of
course
facts
but
there
was
never
been
a
evidentiary
hearing
dealing
with
the
threat
or
the
nature
of
the
threat
involved
in
this
intimidation
statute.
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
that's
what
they're
saying
and
of
course
the
court
below
sought
our
way
that
it
was
substantial
and
it's
the
question
of
semantics
whether
or
not
this
is
a
conclusion.
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
that's
correct.
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
that's
the
issue
and
of
course
we
contend
that
in
the
totality
of
the
complaint
that
we
have
made
out
a
case
on
the
pleadings
when
you
read
the
complaint
as
a
whole
not
picking
out
certain
portions
and
forgetting
others
but
when
you
take
it
as
a
whole
that
we
have
stated
a
cause
of
action
upon
which
relief
could
be
granted
and
that's
the
way
the
case
was
presented
below
and
i
would
urge
the
court
to
deal
with
it
in
that
fashion
here.
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
well,
i
would
say
that
--
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
--
at
that
point,
we
did
not
really
get
to
an
evidentiary
hearing
because
basically
the
--
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
that's
correct.
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
that's
what
the
court
had
before,
yes.
but
specifically,
though
i
have
raised
the
point
in
my
brief
and
i
would
like
to
just
to
point
out
to
the
court
now
though
i
see
that
the
court
has
a
great
deal
of
interest
in
this
point
probably
in
light
of
golden.
but
i
perhaps
i
was
in
error
when
i
pointed
out
that
this
matter
comes
here
really
on
a
direct
appeal
and
in
their
jurisdictional
statement
it
is
our
contention
that
this
issue
was
not
fairly
complies
with
in
that
jurisdictional
statement
and
therefore
this
particular
issue
is
not
before
the
court.
now,
i'll
--
i
understand
that
if
the
court
wants
to
deal
with
this
as
a
jurisdictional
requisite
then
the
doctrine
of
waiver
may
not
apply
but
it's
our
contention
that
this
particular
standing
argument
has
been
waived
because
it
was
one
wherein
an
appeal
should've
been
taken
directly
to
the
court
of
appeals
because
it
was
based
on
a
decision
of
a
single
judge.
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
well,
that's
why
i'm
saying
if
that
is
a
matter
of
jurisdiction
then
i
would
say
that
it
would
not
be
one
that
could
be
waived
but
i
don't
feel
that
under
the
circumstances
here
that
it
would
be
a
matter
of
jurisdiction.
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
that's
what
based;
they
move
a
failure
to
state
of
claim
and
the
court
decided
against
it.
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
they
did
what?
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
well,
i
don't
have
a
copy
of
the
answer
before
me
now
but
and
of
course
unfortunately
mr.
tucker
below
argued
the
matter
--
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
yes.
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
that's
correct.
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
that's
correct,
for
those
purposes
and
they
have
never
really
--
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
that's
correct.
i
would
say
that
if
you
read
their
motion
to
dismiss
it
does
not
really
articulate
one
of
jurisdiction.
i
think
it's
found
beginning
at
page
30
of
the
appendix.
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
that's
correct
and
then
the
three-judge
court
ruled.
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
25
of
the
appendix?
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
let's
see.
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
no.
well,
basically,
no.
we
challenged
the
disorderly
conduct
ordinance
93-1
--
193-1.
we
challenged
the
mob-action
statute.
we
challenged
the
intimidation
statute
and
i
believe
the
resisting
arrest
ordinance
and
there
were
some
few
others
which
we
--
i
don't
have
a
copy
and
see
where
which
we
withdrew
more
or
less
are
challenged
for
the
court
below.
basically,
it
was
two
ordinances
and
two
statutes
and
that
were
challenged
below.
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
two
statutes
were
mob-action
and
the
intimidation
statute
which
is
before
this
particular
court.
the
other
ordinances
were
dealt
with
by
the
single
judge,
judge
will
below.
he
separated
them
saying
that
they
felt
that
it
was
not
for
a
three-judge
court
being
that
they
were
only
ordinances
of
lawful
application.
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
i
don't
know.
i
did
not
make
a
point
of
it,
i
read
it
but
i
really
--
i
guess
what
this
is
on
page
25
is
really
a
listing
of
the
grand
page
of
the
city
counsel
of
the
ordinances
that
fall
under
chapter
193
of
the
municipal
code
of
chicago
that
obviously
--
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
i
just
--
i
don't
think
this
was
attached
on
plaintiff.
we
said
out
if
i
have
the
--
i
have
not
looked
at
it.
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
well,
i
would
say
this
although
it
might've
been
it
was
just
an
index
or
maybe
all
of
the
available
ordinances
under
chapter
193
but
we
only
challenge
193
(voice
overlap).
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
well,
basically,
this,
i
guess
when
we
realize
that
many
of
these
ordinances
that
were
passed
was
specific
reasons
all
of
which
or
some
of
which
have
long
since
cease
to
have
any
meaning.
maybe
i
did
not
--
i
would
say
deal
with
this
particular
portion
of
a
complaint
and
i
don't
know
why
it
was
put
in
there.
maybe
it
was
to
show
that
they
have
many,
many
ways
to
control
us
and
what
we
specifically
were
dealing
with
disorderly
conduct.
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
well,
i
would
ask
the
court
to
reach
a
middle
ground
from
what
you've
said.
i
think
there
is
a
point
in
between
those
two
poles,
in
other
words,
i
would
agree
this
court
should
not
sit
to
hear
contrive
not
substantial
litigation
where
one
would
go
to
a
statute
book
and
dig
them
out.
but
i
think
also
we
should
not
in
the
area
of
the
first
amendment
freedoms
and
this
is
why
i
think
this
is
unique.
and
this
i
think
is
the
reason
for
dombrowski,
wait
until
someone
has
been
tried
and
convicted
before
they
would
have
standing
before
this
court.
i
think
that
this
particular
case
presents
a
factual
circumstance
of
that
middle
ground.
there
was
a
scheme
that
was
entered
into
and
upon
where
we
were
arrest,
where
we
were
intimidated,
where
we
were
thrown
into
jail
with
high
bonds
and
where
there
were
meetings
and
where
the
police
prosecutors
start
going
to
the
statute
book
and
we
heard
about
it
and
we
got
to
court
before
they
did.
now,
i
don't
think
that
we
lose
our
standing
by
beating
them
to
court
and
that's
what
the
issue
i'm
trying
to
impress
upon
this
court.
i
think
that
when
i
say
look
at
the
totality
of
the
chronology
of
events.
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
well,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
yes,
i
can
see
your
concern
but
again
i'm
saying
that
had
nothing
occurred,
had
no
one
been
arrested
other
than
the
many,
many
people
who
were
arrested
perhaps
you
would
be
right.
but
here,
we
had
a
serious
of
arrest,
mass
arrest
and
here,
we
had
all
be
--
other
statutes
and
ordinances
as
used.
it
showed
a
scheme
to
deal
with
this
type
of
protest
activity
in
a
certain
way.
i
think
then
we're
in
a
different
position
and
we
then
perhaps
and
i'll
urged
upon
the
court,
i
think
we
would
have
the
right
to
then
alleged
they're
not
only
going
to
use
the
ones
they've
already
arrested
us
on
but
we
might
it
call
it
pendent
jurisdiction
or
whatever
you
want
to
deal
with
but
i'm
saying
to
deal
--
to
get
away
from
securities
litigation.
that's
deal
with
the
total
problem
now
because
they
now
or
threaten
now
used
mob-action
in
disorderly
conduct.
they
have
threatening
to
use
intimidation
too.
so,
we
therefore
put
it
in
as
part
and
parcel
of
this
complaint
and
therefore
i
feel
that
the
court
below
had
jurisdiction
and
i
feel
that
as
i
stand
here
now,
i
have
standing
to
sue
and
to
the
right
to
attack
the
intimidation
statute
also
as
well
as
the
ones
that
we've
attacked
below
with
proper
standing
and
i'd
say
well,
with
no
allegation
below
that
we
did
not
have
proper
standing.
basically,
for
those
reasons
i'd
like
to
urge
that
the
court
affirmed
the
court
below
because
unless
we
have
a
basis
for
dealing
with
these
matters
with
in
the
framer
of
the
courts.
all
of
those
things
which
they
urged
about
taking
to
the
streets
in
a
righteous
way
may
come
to
pass.
and
i
would
suggest
that
when
we
tighten
the
news
around
people's
neck
and
it
become
frustrated.
they
have
no
way
to
go
but
the
mostly
illegal
way.
thank
you
for
listening.
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
--
may
it
please
the
court.
i'd
like
to
first
address
myself
to
the
standing
issue
and
then
to
the
issue
on
the
merits
of
whether
or
not
for
an
analysis
of
the
statute
it
was
over
broad
and
deterred
first
amendment
freedoms.
first
of
all,
i
think
mr.
bilton
got
himself
into
a
problem
with
the
standing
issue.
you
see
in
this
particular
case,
the
history
of
this
case
is
such
that
it's
here
only
on
one
particle
of
a
broad
problem
that
was
brought
to
court
below.
this
case
grew
out
of
a
situation
in
1967
where
there
were
five
mass
arrest
situations.
a
committee
of
22
lawyers
of
the
local
bar
and
some
from
out
of
town
got
together
basically
a
dombrowski
complaint,
taking
from
some
of
these
mass
arrest
situations,
sometimes
there
had
been
55
people
arrested
and
as
many
as
100
in
other
occasions
and
making
them
members
or
representatives
of
the
class.
we
have
here
seven
subclasses
of
the
total
class.
one
subclass
was
arrested
as
a
group
on
august
01,
1967
charged
with
mini
crimes,
mob
action
and
disorderly
conduct
being
the
main
ones.
another
group
was
arrested
on
may
21th,
1967
also
charged
with
mob
action
and
disorderly
conduct
and
resisting
arrest
and
a
few
other
charges.
september
14th,
1967,
another
group
was
arrested
and
charged
with
mob
action,
disorderly
conduct
and
resisting
arrest.
now,
--
then
again,
on
august
23rd,
1967,
another
group
was
arrested
and
charged
with
mob
action,
resisting
arrest
and
disorderly
conduct.
and
then
to
round
off
this
particular
plus
--
also
in
august
4th,
1967,
another
group
was
arrested
and
charged
with
mob
action,
disorderly
conduct
and
i
believe
also
resisting
arrest.
now,
we
added
also
a
group
known
as
act
which
was
an
incorporated
association
which
more
or
less
advocated
the
confrontation
of
public
issues
in
a
forum
of
the
streets.
we
also
added
as
members
of
the
class
individuals
who
had
not
been
arrested
and
charged
with
anything,
but
merely
were
negroes
who
wanted
to
speak
out
against
what
was
happening
in
the
city
of
chicago
at
that
time
in
1967
and
we
put
them
in
the
class
and
alleged
that
their
first
amendment
rights
were
being
chilled
by
this
particular
plan
of
action
that
was
being
perpetrated
by
the
city
of
chicago
on
people
of
arresting
them
with
no
hope
of
convictions,
with
high
bonds
and
keeping
them
in
jail.
sometimes
two
weeks
before
we
could
go
in
on
motions
to
reduce
the
bail
or
could
get
them
out
by
raising
the
bail.
now,
this
court
in
the
golden
v.
zwickler
case
set
the
following
language
with
regard
to
issue
of
standing,
although
there
probably
they
were
addressing
--
you
were
addressing
yourselves
to
the
issue
of
mootness.
but
you
said
the
difference
between
an
abstract
question
and
a
controversy
contemplated
by
the
declaratory
judgment
act
is
necessarily
one
of
degree
and
it
would
difficult
if
it
would
be
possible
to
fashion
a
precise
test
for
determining
in
every
case
whether
there
is
such
a
controversy.
basically,
the
question
in
each
case
is
whether
there
is
a
substantial
controversy
between
parties
having
adverse
legal
interest
of
sufficient
eminence,
immediacy
and
reality
to
warrant
the
issuance
of
a
declaratory
judgment
and
you
cited
in
support
of
that
the
maryland
case
and
the
company
case.
now,
in
this
particular
case,
you
have
to
know
something
about
the
city
of
chicago
in
order
to
understand
how
the
intimidation
statute
gets
here.
the
city
of
chicago
has
a
large
corporation
of
counsel's
office
which
is
charged
with
admitting
instances
among
other
things,
the
enforcement
of
the
city's
ordinances.
and
in
1967,
a
gentleman
named
richard
elrod
who
later
became
a
state
legislator
with
who
was
at
that
time
in
the
ordinance
enforcement
division
of
the
corporation
of
counsel's
office
was
present
at
every
major
demonstration
in
the
city
of
chicago.
and
he
was
the
man
on
the
scene
charged
with
the
duty
of
telling
the
chicago
police
who
they
would
arrest,
when
they
would
affect
the
arrest,
and
what
charges
would
be
brought
against
the
alleged
defendants.
now,
he
was
present
at
each
and
every
one
of
these
instances
that
i
quoted
to
you
in
the
complaint
of
the
five
groups
of
people
that
were
arrested.
some
50
people
sometimes
and
sometimes
as
many
as
a
hundred
people
in
these
mass
arrest
situations.
now,
it
was
richard
elrod
who
dreamed
of
the
notion
to
later
use
the
intimidation
statute
which
didn't
carry
just
a
year
in
jail
and
would
carry
five
years
in
jail.
and
when
we
as
lawyers
representing
these
people
that
were
on
this
threat
we
beat
him
to
the
courthouse
because
we
did
not
want
anybody
charged
with
a
felony
that
carried
five
years
for
merely
protesting
in
a
peaceful
way
and
trying
to
seek
a
readdress
of
their
grievances.
now,
the
reason
that
the
standing
issue
was
not
raised
in
the
jurisdictional
statement
and
the
reason
it
just
came
up
in
the
brief
of
these
particular
appellants
is
that
there
were
several
groups
of
people
below.
the
state's
attorney's
office
represented
the
defendants
who
were
county
officials
and
the
corporation
counsel's
office
represented
the
defendants
who
were
city
officials.
and
richard
elrod
of
course
was
the
corporation
counsel,
the
assistant
in-charge
of
defending
the
city
officials
and
it
was
richard
elrod
i
tell
you
who
dreamed
up
the
intimidation
statute.
so,
the
issue
never
came
up
because
when
the
lawyers
who
tried
the
case
and
i'm
one
of
the
last
of
the
22
that
are
stuck
with
this
case,
we're
in
court
with
mr.
elrod
and
with
the
other
lawyers
who
represented
the
county
officials,
obviously,
the
issue
never
came
up
because
we
knew
and
everybody
else
knew
that
there
was
a
substantial
controversy
about
this
intimidation
statute
that
mr.
elrod
wanted
to
use
it
and
we
be
in
the
court
and
the
three-judge
court
agree
that
as
the
statute
was
perverted
or
could
be
read
it
was
quite
a
chilling
effect
and
had
a
chilling
effect
on
first
amendment
freedoms.
now,
mr.
bilton
has
so
appeared
and
told
you
about
taking
money
from
somebody.
i
want
to
tell
you
how
the
statute
was
intended
to
be
used
and
how
you
can
read
it
and
in
plain
english
it
would
stick.
when
you
make
a
victim
or
a
so-called
a
victim
of
that
particular
statute,
a
public
official
and
then
you
read
the
statute
that
you
will
threaten
him
in
order
to
get
him
to
do
something
or
to
fail
to
do
something
by
permitting
a
crime
then
i
submit
to
you,
you
have
to
read
the
entire
criminal
code
of
the
state
of
illinois
and
also
the
ordinances
of
the
city
of
chicago
and
all
of
the
other
municipalities
in
the
state
of
illinois
to
determine
whether
or
not
they
are
threatening
a
crime.
for
example,
as
the
three-judge
court
said,
if
you
say
to
a
public
official,
either
you
will
readdress
our
grievances
or
we
will
picket
the
city
hall.
now,
if
there
is
an
ordinance
in
the
city
of
chicago
that
prohibits
the
picketing
of
the
city
hall,
you
have
just
put
yourself
in
a
five-year
nuisance
to
stand
trial
for
the
intimidation
statute.
and
that
is
why
we
are
here
and
that
is
why
the
three-judge
court
said
clearly,
this
statute
as
read
and
it
can
be
read
that
way
is
a
quite
a
chilling
statute
so
far
as
first
amendment
freedoms
are
concerned.
and
the
court
itself
went
to
several
examples
which
i
can
quote
if
i
can
find
the
examples
of
people
blocking
an
intersection
with
baby
carriages
or
people
deciding
to
do
things
which
in
and
off
themselves
would
be
misdemeanors
if
carried
through
to
fruition
and
because
you've
threatened
to
do
a
misdemeanor
to
bring
a
public
official
into
the
public
forum
to
do
what
he
should
do
then
you
are
charged
with
a
crime
that
carries
with
a
five-year
penalty.
and
i
say
to
you
that
this
statute
on
its
face
is
void
because
it
is
over
broad
and
as
your
honors
got
into
the
question
with
mr.
bilton,
there
are
many
other
statutes
in
the
state
of
illinois
and
many
other
ordinances
of
the
city
of
chicago
which
deal
with
conduct
that
may
be
antisocial
or
may
create
harm
to
property
or
to
persons.
i
say
to
you
this
is
not
such
a
statute
as
it
is
presently
drafted.
and
another
thing
back
on
the
standing
issue,
mr.
elrod
himself
when
he
became
a
member
of
the
legislature
after
the
initial
three
judge
opinion
in
this
case
entered
into
the
state
legislature
and
had
passed
a
bill
repealing
this
particular
statute.
and
i
don't
know
today
whether
or
not
the
governor
has
signed
that
repealer
bill,
but
i
do
know
that
a
letter
was
sent
to
the
governor's
office
asking
him
to
hold
up
on
signing
the
repealer
because
it
would
moot
the
issues
before
the
court
today
and
i
say
to
you
that
what
we
are
doing
here
in
this
issue
of
statute
--
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
they
don't
appear
in
the
record
because
the
last
time
i
was
here
to
argue
the
case
i
didn't
know
that.
i
found
out
after
the
first
argument
of
this
case.
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
well,
i
think
we
would
stipulate
to
the
court
that
a
bill
was
introduced
and
passed
by
the
illinois
legislature
of
course
it's
a
fact,
repealing
this
section
of
the
intimidation
act
of
the
state
of
illinois.
now,
i
don't
know
today
whether
or
not
the
governor
has
signed
that
bill.
but
i'm
saying
the
gentleman
who
dreamed
up
this
idea,
richard
elrod
introduced
and
passed
and
saw
that
the
bill
was
passed.
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
well,
there
is
basically
i
maybe
--
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
mr.
elrod
was
the
assistant
corporation
counsel.
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
oh,
i
understand.
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
that
is
not
in
the
record
and
other
than
the
fact
that
if
you
read
the
record
you
may
see
that
mr.
eldrod
was
a
party
to
this
lawsuit
so
far
as
representing
some
of
the
defendants
who
are
not
here
and
they
would
be
the
city
officials.
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
only
by
our
complaint
and
our
complaint
is
that
the
threat
was
made
and
it's
a
question
of
whether
or
not
the
word
threat
is
a
conclusion
argued
by
counsel
or
whether
it's
a
fact.
and
i'm
saying
to
you
that
the
threat
as
used
in
the
complaint
to
paragraph,
aid
of
the
complaint
and
again
i
believe
24
of
the
complaint,
25
of
the
complaint,
paragraph
34
of
the
complaint
and
paragraph
37
of
the
complaint
where
we
also
say
in
all
these
paragraphs
that
we
have
been
threatened
by
the
use
of
these
statutes
and
the
threatened
used
of
other
statutes
that
have
not
yet
been
used.
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
but
the
question
--
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
that's
correct.
the
only
thing
i'm
saying
to
you
is
--
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
i'm
saying
that
there
is
--
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
no,
no
and
the
reason
is
this
question
didn't
even
come
up
in
the
jurisdictional
statement
in
this
court
in
violation
of
your
rule
15.1
(c)
and
i
make
that
a
point
in
my
brief.
in
my
brief
i
say
the
question
was
not
set
forth
from
jurisdictional
statement
or
fairly
compliance
therein
as
required
by
rule
15.1
(c)
of
this
court.
then
i
go
on
to
say
the
question
was
one
decided
by
a
single
judge
from
whose
decision
an
appeal
must
be
taken
to
the
court
of
appeals.
now,
they
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
and
that's
in
the
record.
that
motion
to
dismiss
was
denied
by
judge
will,
sitting
as
one
judge
before
he
convened
the
three-judge
court.
i'm
saying
that
they
at
that
point
had
a
right
to
appeal
that
decision
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit.
they
choose
not
to
appeal
and
then
when
the
three-judge
court
was
convened,
they
went
ahead
and
if
the
three-judge
court
decided
that
on
the
face
of
this
particular
statute
it
was
over
broad
and
therefore
unconstitutional.
now,
i'm
saying
that
when
you
have
a
situation
like
this
where
standing
was
never
raised
and
i
did
and
i
must
apologize,
though
all
aside
of
the
record,
maybe
to
force
the
record
to
give
you
the
background
of
this
thing,
show
you
the
reason,
the
explanation
for
this.
it
was
never
raised
in
the
district
court
before
judge
will,
an
appeal
was
never
taken
on
the
issue
to
the
seventh
circuit
and
then
when
the
statute
was
knocked
out
on
its
face,
then
for
the
first
time
in
their
brief,
even
after
filing
the
jurisdictional
statement
as
an
afterthought,
perhaps
and
this
was
before
the
golden
case,
they
decided
that
perhaps
they
would
have
shot
at
us
before
this
court
because
of
standing
because
no
one
was
ever
charged
actually
with
the
violation
of
the
intimidation
statute.
what
i'm
saying
to
you
as
you
said
in
the
golden
case,
you
must
look
at
the
totality
of
all
the
circumstances
before
the
court.
you
cannot
just
pull
out
one
element
of
this
case.
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
that's
correct.
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
well,
that
maybe
the
way
to
read
it.
the
only
thing
i'm
saying
is
--
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
the
only
thing
i'm
saying
is
--
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
right.
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
may
i
answer
that
this
way
your
honor?
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
that
is
whether
or
not
you
read
the
word
"threat"
as
being
an
allegation
of
fact
or
as
you
read
it
as
a
conclusion
by
the
pleader.
now,
i
say
to
your
honor,
you
have
a
perfect
right
to
read
that
as
a
pleading
of
fact
because
it
is
a
fact
that
we
were
threatened
with
the
use
of
this
statute
and
it
is
a
pleading
of
a
fact.
we
were
threatened
by
the
use
of
this
statute
and
there
is
a
probably
a
problem
in
some
matters
as
to
whether
or
not
you
will
understand
the
word
as
you
hear
a
threat
to
be
a
conclusion.
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
well,
there
must
be
very
clear
and
present
danger
and
apparent
ability
to
carry
out
a
threat
and
i
went
through
the
record
only
to
explain
that
the
person
who
made
the
threat
was
present
in
court.
when
i
make
a
threat
i
have
the
apparent
ability
to
carry
out
the
threat
and
so
i
say
---
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
i
understand
your
honor,
but
may
i
say
this,
your
honor
does
not
have
to
go
outside
the
record
to
deal
with
this
case
and
i
will
show
you
your
honors
how
you
don't
have
to
do
that.
in
this
particular
case,
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
there
is
standing
is
a
factual
issue.
and
although
it
may
result
in
a
conclusion
that
may
have
jurisdictional
effects,
i'm
still
saying
that
initially
it
was
a
factual
determination
to
be
made
initially
by
the
district
judge
and
i'm
saying
your
honors
that
it
was
in
fact
made
and
that
it
was
conceded
and
that
either
it
was
waived
and
i'm
saying
that
your
honors
(voice
overlaps)
--
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
that's
correct
your
honor
but
that
of
course
is
the
ultimate
for
using
the
word
(voice
overlaps)
--
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
--whether
or
not
there's
a
sufficient
case
of
controversy,
but
(voice
overlaps)
judgment
and
i'm
only
saying
standing
as
a
short
pen
method
of
saying
that.
well,
i'm
saying
that
--
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
they
were
chilled
and
their
first
amendment
rights
were
--
but
whenever
you
do
this
your
honor
at
the
back
i'm
saying
there
is
a
distinct
difference
that
this
court
has
recognized
in
this
particular
area
between
cases
that
deal
with
the
first
amendment
freedoms
and
all
other
classes
of
cases.
now,
and
the
reason
for
that
is
quite
important.
if
we
don't
have
an
effective
and
quick
method
to
effectively
deal
with
and
protect
first
amendment
freedoms
--
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
--
(inaudible)
will
not
--
they'll
be
dead
when
you
get
to
this
court
in
the
wrong
way.
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
no,
your
honor,
this
--
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
well,
they
might
be
put
in
and
you
might
even
say
that
they
came
in
under
pendent
jurisdiction
and
we
have
the
substantial
controversy
between
the
first
five
groups
--
the
people
who
were
arrested.
there's
no
question
that
there
was
a
substantial
controversy
going
on
at
that
time
between
the
mass
arrest
situations
and
the
city
of
chicago.
now,
all
that
controversy
as
a
result
of
what
was
happening
to
the
people
that
were
arrested.
in
our
humble
opinion
they
were
the
people
who
were
standing
on
the
sidelines,
who
might
have
wanted
to
picket,
who
were
not
picketing
because
they
felt,
oh
look
what's
happening
to
these
people,
there
in
there
picketing
and
they're
getting
the
heads
beat
in
and
they're
being
arrested
and
they're
being
kept
in
jail.
now,
why
should
i
go
out
there
and
picket
peacefully
and
go
to
jail
for
two
weeks
before
i
can
even
post
bond.
now,
it
is
these
people
that
i
think
this
court
should
address
itself
too
because
it
is
these
people
who
then
after
seeing
the
suppression
of
the
other
people
who
are
the
activists,
stand
silent
and
stand
to
moot
and
that's
the
danger
to
order
liberty
and
that
is
the
sole
reason
why
this
court
has
made
a
distinction
between
first
amendment
cases
and
all
other
cases.
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
no,
mr.
judge,
i
was
speaking
fast
then
you
came
out.
i
apologize
for
there's
nothing
in
this
record.
these
people
were
arrested,
they
were
held
on
bond
as
the
record
shows
and
they
were
later
discharged
and
we're
saying
that
because
these
people
in
the
first
five
subclasses
were
dealt
with
in
this
manner
with
no
--
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
in
this
particular
case,
there
were
four
or
five
groups
arrested
and
we
picked
some
of
the
people
out
of
these
groups
as
representative
of
the
class.
now,
we
added
it
and
in
an
answer
to
justice
marshall's
answered
question,
people
who
were
never
arrested,
but
who
wanted
to
speak
out
and
use
speech
in
all
of
the
matter.
now,
i'm
saying
to
the
court
that
this
--
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
yes,
in
that
point
your
honor
which
starts
--
in
the
appendix
started
at
page
four,
paragraph
8
plaintiff
lawrence
--
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
it's
in
the
complaint.
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
it
was
--
no,
paragraph
8
i
think
was
denied.
no,
paragraph
8
was
admitted
i
believe
and
we
find
the
answer.
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
in
any
event,
there
was
no
question
about
who
the
subclasses
were.
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
mr.
bilton
has
to
be,
no.
he
said
the
bill
has
been
--
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
the
bill
has
a
veto.
i
just
got
this
note
from
mr.
bilton
two
minutes
ago.
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
so,
it
is
not
moot,
but
the
only
thing
i'm
saying
is
that
when
you
look
at
whether
or
not
there
is
a
case
in
controversy,
i
think
you
have
to
relax
your
standard
so
far
as
first
amendment
cases
are
concerned
because
this
court
has
said
and
i
think
that
we
can't
cross
over
this,
that
we
are
not
really
dealing
so
much
with
the
people
that
want
to
break
the
law.
there
are
statutes
on
the
books
that
are
available
to
give
these
people
their
just
rights
and
to
put
them
in
jail,
commensurate
with
the
crime
that
they
have
perpetuated
in
their
actions.
but
when
they
backup
a
step
and
say
that
when
you
use
language
and
you
verbalize
your
grievances
open
in
a
public
forum
and
you
address
them
to
a
public
official
and
you
say,
"do
something
for
us
please
or
we
will
do
x"
and
it
turns
out
that
analysis
of
all
the
statutes
they're
been
contemplating
x
is
applied,
that
you're
then
subject
to
five
years
imprisonment.
i
say
this
runs
smack
down
into
what
we
are
trying
to
start
out
with
in
this
country
of
having
truly
conflicting
interests
balanced
and
i'm
saying
that
they're
always
on
a
collision
course
that
anytime
that
you
take
to
the
public
forum
and
say,
"do
something
for
us
--"
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
okay.
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
at
this
point
just
digress
and
point
out
to
your
honors
the
problem
i
think
that
was
bothering
this
particular
court
and
that
is
that
i
feel
and
i
have
a
feeling
that
you
have
a
fear
of
being
inundated
by
this
type
of
case.
if
you
relax
the
standing
required
in
a
declaratory
judgment
action
to
the
degree
that
we
feel
is
necessary
in
order
to
protect
first
amendment
freedoms,
but
i
would
like
to
say
two
things
and
try
to
make
this
clear
to
the
court
so
that
you
understand
it
from
really
a
practicing
lawyer's
point
of
view,
one
who
is
concerned
with
first
amendment
freedoms.
first
of
all,
i
would
like
to
say
to
you
what
i
feel
would
have
happened
had
the
state
in
this
particular
proceeding
one
to
race
to
the
courthouse.
now,
it
has
been
called
in
many
circles
that
this
is
the
so-called
race
to
the
courthouse
whether
or
not
the
state
will
file
the
charge
or
whether
we
will
get
to
court
and
ask
for
declaratory
judgment
on
these
over
broad
statutes
first
in
federal
forum.
i
like
to
say
that
this
is
from
the
lawyer's
point
of
view,
had
the
state
in
this
particular
proceeding
won
the
race
to
the
courthouse
in
addition
to
the
complex,
legal,
and
factual
issues
that
i
have
had
to
address
myself
to
hear,
myself
to
hear
over
the
last
three
years.
i
would
have
then
had
to
deal
with
in
another
forum
also
the
issue
of
bail,
the
issue
of
defense
in
a
criminal
case,
the
issue
of
being
prepared
to
try
the
case
if
it
was
not
enjoined
and
also
the
anti-injunction
statute
in
the
federal
system.
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
well,
i'm
saying
it
does
not
have
to
be
for
the
future.
we
have
a
problem
here
and
i
think
that
the
court
is
trying
to
address
itself
to
that
problem
because
in
dombrowski
and
in
zwickler,
this
court
said
that
it
would
be
enough
to
have
a
threat
of
arrest
under
the
proper
facts
and
circumstances.
and
i
detect
from
not
only
some
of
the
questions
today,
but
the
previous
time
i
argued
this
case
that
this
court
also
is
dealing
in
its
own
mind
with
the
floodgate
problem
and
that
is
whether
or
not
it
should
be
inundated
with
this
type
of
litigation
if
we're
able
to
sit
back
in
our
office
and
go
through
the
criminal
code
and
say,
"that's
a
good
statute,
that's
a
bad
statute.
we'll
file
a
suit
on
the
bad
statutes
and
then
come
to
court."
i
don't
think
it's
going
to
happen
that
way
because
these
cases
are
expensive.
these
cases
are
varietous
and
they
take
as
you
can
see
in
this
case
three
to
four
years
of
a
lawyer's
time
and
that's
one
issue.
but
on
the
other
hand,
if
the
state
wins
the
race
to
the
courthouse
and
there
is
a
threat
and
we
have
to
wait
even
though
they
are
threatening
us
like
today
to
file
a
suit
tomorrow
and
then
we
have
to
wait
until
tomorrow
when
suit
is
actually
filed,
then
in
addition
to
the
complex
problems
in
this
type
of
case,
in
this
federal
forum
i'm
also
put
to
the
task
of
dealing
with
the
complex
legal
and
factual
issues
in
the
state
court.
so,
i'm
saying
to
your
honors
that
the
floodgate
argument
that
might
be
thrust
upon
you
today
will
be
found
to
be
wanting
in
this
particular
type
of
case
because
it
is
a
very
burdensome
type
of
litigation.
and
number
one,
you
must
get
one
judge
of
a
district
court
to
hear
your
case,
look
at
your
complaint
and
decide
whether
or
not
in
his
discretion
he
will
convene
a
three-judge
court
as
was
done
in
this
case
and
motions
for
this
dismissal
of
your
complaint
may
be
found
as
they
were
found
in
this
case.
and
i
like
to
point
out
that
these
issues
were
met
ahead
on,
on
a
motion
to
dismiss
filed
in
this
particular
case
and
i'd
like
to
in
the
time
i
have
remaining
address
myself
to
four
portions
of
the
appendix
which
i
think
are
important,
which
are
four
specific
portions
of
the
three-judge
court's
opinion.
now,
at
page
57
of
the
appendix
the
court
said
as
follows.
it
said,
"plaintiff's
filed
their
complaint
on
october
27th,
1967.
simultaneously,
they
moved
that
a
three-judge
court
be
convened
to
hear
and
determine
the
issues
presented
therein.
shortly
thereafter
both
the
state
and
city
defendants
moved
to
dismiss,
contending
interalia
that
the
complaint
failed
to
disclose
a
basis
for
equitable
relief
and
the
adoption
of
federal
abstention
should
be
utilized
to
allow
the
state
courts
an
opportunity
to
adjudicate
the
issues
presented
in
the
complaint.
an
opinion
dealing
with
these
motions
was
issued
on
december
28,
1967.
the
defendant's
motion
to
dismiss
were
denied."
now,
at
page
62
of
the
same
opinion,
it's
found
on
page
62
of
the
appendix,
the
court
there
said
as
follows,
"the
principles
announced
by
the
supreme
court
in
dombrowski
and
zwickler
appear
clearly
applicable
in
the
instant
case.
plaintiffs
claim
that
statute
is
invalid
because
of
vagueness,
indebtedness
and
over
breadth,
have
been
used
by
defendants
in
furtherance
of
a
scheme
to
discourage
plaintiff's
legitimate
exercise
of
first
amendment
rights.
in
dombrowski,
the
court
indicated
that
defense
in
a
state
criminal
prosecution
is
not
sufficient
to
correct
either
of
these
evils.
arrest,
detention,
and
threats
of
prosecution
may
have
an
interim
effect
on
free
expression
where
prosecutions
are
instituted
in
bad-faith
in
furtherance
of
a
scheme
to
discourage
protected
activities,
the
ultimate
success
of
the
defendant
does
not
alter
the
impropriety
of
the
unconstitutional
scheme.
the
adjudication
simply
resolves
the
guilt
or
innocence
of
the
defendant.
it
does
not
purge
the
scheme
of
its
impact
upon
federally
protected
rights."
and
then
at
page
94,
the
same
court,
the
three
judges
continues
and
they
say
there,
"the
provision
is
not
vague.
it
is
however
over
broad,
i
am
speaking
now
of
the
particular
statute,
since
it
prohibits
threats
of
insubstantial
evil,
the
commission
of
criminal
offenses
against
persons
or
property
is
a
substantial
evil
and
the
state
may
legitimately
proscribe
the
making
of
threats
to
commit
such
offenses.
the
commission
of
offenses
against
public
order
only
however
is
not
such
a
substantial
evil
that
the
state
may
prohibit
the
threat
of
it."
and
then
they
go
on
to
deal
with
the
statute
to
show
examples
as
to
how
you
can
commit
disorderly
conduct
and
because
of
this
statute
end
up
with
five
years
imprisonment.
now,
back
--
i'd
like
to
go
back
on
page
84
of
the
appendix,
page
88
excuse
me
where
the
court
points
out
this
and
i
think
this
is
important.
on
page
88
and
they
say,
"however,
at
the
outset
of
this
analysis
it
should
be
recognized
that
illinois
has
no
legitimate
interest
in
proscribing
as
intimidation
statements
that
have
no
reasonable
tendency
to
coerce
or
statements
which
although
alarming
are
not
expressions
of
an
intent
to
act.
legitimate
political
expression
intended
to
secure
a
changes
in
a
society's
legal,
political,
social,
or
economic
structure
frequently
to
take
the
form
of
expressions
about
future
events
or
conditions.
such
expressions
may
be
in
the
form
of
promises,
predictions,
or
warnings
or
threats
of
lawful
action.
and
i
know
my
time
is
up
but
i
like
to
say
here
this
is
the
trust
of
this
particular
statute
that
we
contend
as
unconstitutional
and
because
of
that
we
feel
this
court
has
a
duty
to
affirm
the
court
below.
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i'd
like
to
begin
my
answering
argument
by
some
observation
in
light
of
the
fact
that
no
matter
has
been
argued
twice
before
and
in
light
of
the
fact
there
are
four
cases
here
which
is
apparent
that
we
are
dealing
with
the
cases
that
began
with
dombrowski
versus
pfister.
and
the
issue
here
is
whether
or
not
in
the
case
before
the
court
we
have
standing
to
sue.
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
in
dombrowski,
the
court
said
in
his
opinion
and
i'm
quoting
from
his
language
because
i
think
it's
important
to
--
really
the
background
of
my
argument.
the
assumption
that
defense
of
a
criminal
prosecution
will
generally
assure
ample
vindication
of
constitutional
rights
is
unfounded
in
such
cases
and
it
cites
baggett
versus
bullitt.
for
the
threat
of
sanctions
may
deter
almost
as
potentially
as
the
actual
application
of
sanctions.
because
of
the
sensitive
nature
of
constitutionally
protected
expression,
we
have
not
required
that
all
of
those
subject
to
overbroad
regulations
risk
prosecution
to
test
their
rights
for
free
expression
of
transcendent
value
to
all
society
and
not
merely
to
those
exercising
their
rights
might
be
the
loser.
we
have
fashioned
this
exception
to
the
usual
rules
governing
standing
and
that's
at
united
states
versus
raines.
because
of
the
danger
of
tolerating
in
the
area
of
first
amendment
freedoms,
the
existence
of
a
penal
statute
acceptable
to
--
of
sweeping
and
improper
application
citing
naacp
versus
button.
if
the
rule
were
otherwise,
the
contours
of
regulation
would
have
to
be
hammered
out
case
by
case
and
tested
only
by
those
hardy
enough
to
risk
criminal
prosecution
to
determine
the
proper
sculpt
of
regulation.
now
it
is
with
that
in
mind,
your
honors,
that
i
further
point
out
to
the
court
the
language
in
golden
versus
zwickler
as
follows:
“the
difference
between
an
abstract
question
and
a
controversy
contemplated
by
the
declaratory
of
judgment
act
is
necessarily
one
of
degree.
and
it
would
be
difficult
if
it
would
be
possible
to
fashion
a
precise
test
for
determining
in
every
case
whether
there
is
such
a
controversy.”
basically,
the
question
in
each
case
is
whether
the
facts
alleged
under
all
the
circumstances
show
that
there
is
a
substantial
controversy
between
parties
having
adverse
legal
interest
of
sufficient
immediacy
and
reality
to
warrant
the
issuance
of
a
declaratory
judgment
citing
maryland
casualty
company
versus
pacific
oil.
now,
your
honors,
with
those
two
cases
in
mind,
i
address
your
attention
to
what
has
been
characterized
as
our
dombrowski-type
complaint.
and
i
ought
to
say
to
you
your
honors
as
it
has
come
out
here,
the
particular
injunction
involved
here
as
can
be
seen
from
page
104
of
the
appendix,
did
not
only
deal
with
chapter
38
section
12-6
of
illinois
criminal
code.
it
dealt
with
chapter
38
section
25-1(a)
(2),
chapter
38
section
12-6
(a)
(3).
and
also
your
honors,
which
this
injunction
did
not
deal
with
but
another
one
issued
by
a
single
judge,
judge
welt,
dealt
with
two
ordinances
of
the
city
of
chicago.
now,
the
background
of
this
case
is
as
follows:
in
1967,
there
were
a
series
of
arrest
and
we'd
like
to
point
out
to
you,
your
honors
the
facts
involved
in
this
particular
case.
we
have
alleged,
your
honors,
in
our
–
well,
it's
in
the
record
i'll
give
you
the
page
number
for
each
particular
circumstance.
but
starting
with
page
12
and
paragraph
27
of
our
complaint,
we
deal
there
with
a
mass
arrest
situation
that
occurred
on
the
first
day
of
august
1967
and
certain
plaintiffs
were
arrested
and
charged
as
the
complaint
states
with
four
violations
of
law
under
illinois
law.
two
statutes
and
two
ordinances,
they
were
charged
with
the
mob-action
statute,
the
resisting
arrest
statute,
the
disorderly
conduct
ordinance,
and
the
resisting
arrest
ordinance.
now,
on
the
14th
day
of
september
1967,
there
was
another
incident
where
there
was
a
mass
arrest
situation.
i
might
back
up
and
say
that
the
first
incident
was
locally
called
in
chicago
the
big
gym
incident
because
there,
a
negro
had
been
shot
by
a
white
man
and
people
had
gathered
to
peaceably
and
i
emphasize
this
to
peaceably
protest
against
this
unlawful
shooting
of
julius
woods,
a
negro
citizen.
now,
in
the
incident
that
occurred
on
september
14,
1967,
it
occurred
that
43rd
street
in
chicago,
43rd
in
langley
and
there
was
a
gathering
there
for
the
peaceful
and
lawful
demonstration
to
protest
against
the
unlawful
attack
and
brutal
beating
of
an
18-year-old
negro
woman
who
reside
in
the
community
by
police
officers.
the
other
incident
is
the
incident
of
may
21,
1967
and
there
was
a
gathering
at
51st
street
in
south
park
avenue
in
the
city
of
chicago
to
peaceably
protest
for
redress
of
grievances
and
that
they
wanted
to
rename
washington
park
to
a
name
that
they
felt
would
be
more
relevant
in
location
and
character
to
the
predominantly
number
of
negro
residents
who
resided
in
the
vicinity
of
that
park.
there
was
another
mass
arrest
in
that
situation.
on
august
23,
1967,
there
was
a
gathering
at
the
111th
street
in
the
city
of
chicago
to
protest
and
to
inquire
with
respect
to
the
unlawful
shooting
of
another
negro
youth
and
resident
of
that
community.
on
august
4,
1967,
there
was
a
gathering
peacefully
at
a
playground
to
protest
that
there
were
not
sufficient
playgrounds
located
in
certain
sections
of
the
city
of
chicago,
and
particularly
this
was
at
3501
south
wallace
street
in
chicago.
and
the
protest
was
against
the
lack
and
absence
of
adequate
playground
facilities
in
the
black
community.
now,
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
in
each
and
every
one
of
these
particular
arrests
that
took
place
in
the
summer
of
1967,
all
of
the
people
who
arrested
in
mass
the
following
things
happened.
they
were
all
charged
with
four
identical
charges:
mob
action,
state
resisting
arrest,
city
ordinance
resisting
arrest,
and
the
city
ordinance
of
disorderly
conduct.
in
each
and
every
instance,
the
people
had
bonds
placed
against
them
ranging
from
$10,000.00
up
to
and
including
$50,000.00
as
is
alleged
in
the
complaint.
now,
with
this
background,
we
then
go
into
our
allegations,
which
bring
us
to
the
intimidation
statute.
we
have
alleged
that
there
was,
and
i
will
point
out
the
points
and
parts
of
the
complaint
at
paragraph
21
of
the
complaint
we
alleged
the
following.
we
alleged
that
the
defendants,
this
being
the
mayor
of
chicago,
the
chief
judge
of
the
circuit
court
of
chicago,
the
sheriff,
the
ordinance
enforcement
person,
and
the
corporation
counsel's
office,
and
certain
magistrates
which
were
named
as
defendants
in
the
original
complaint.
we
alleged
that,
them
or
some
of
them
have
met
together
on
more
than
one
occasion,
they
have
discussed,
formulated,
outlined
and
agreed
to
a
detailed
plan
and
scheme
of
harassment,
arrest,
detention,
setting
of
exorbitant
and
excessive
bail,
prosecutions,
trials,
conviction
fines,
and
imprisonment
which
detail
plan
and
program
they
have
agreed
to
direct
against
plaintiffs
herein
and
other
citizens
of
the
united
states,
members
of
the
same
class
as
these
plaintiffs
similarly
situated
solely
for
the
purpose
of
deterring,
hindering,
preventing
and
depriving
these
plaintiffs
of
rights,
privileges
and
immunities
secured
to
them
by
the
constitutions
and
laws
of
united
states,
and
more
particularly
of
the
first
amendment
privileges
of
speech
and
assembly.
now
we
allege
in
subparagraph
(a)
under
21
that
the
defendant
james
conlisk
who
is
the
superintendent
police
and
richard
jay
l.
rod
who
was
in-charge
in
of
ordinance
enforcement
of
the
corporations
councils
office.
as
a
result
of
the
above
described
meetings
and
this
is
found
pages
9
and
10
of
the
record,
among
defendants
and
formulation
of
the
above
described
plan
and
scheme
have
been
designated
by
their
superiors
namely
defendants
richard
jay
daley
and
raymond
f.
simon
respectfully
to
be
principal
persons
to
implement
and
carry
out
the
aforesaid
plans
of
the
deterrence,
hindrance
and
prevention
of
the
exercise
of
plaintiffs
first
amendment
privileges
of
speech
and
assembly.
by
designating
the
occasions,
places
and
manner
of
arrest
as
well
as
the
number
of
plaintiffs
to
be
arrested
and
by
actual
designation
of
particular
places
of
detention
or
particular
plaintiffs
as
distinguished
from
other
persons
arrested
in
the
city
of
chicago.
then
in
the
subparagraph
(c)
of
that
same
paragraph
21
found
at
page
11,
defendants
richard
jay
l.
rod
and
the
defendant
john
j.
stamos
acting
through
his
subordinates
as
a
states
attorney
of
cook
county
have
threatened
and
actually
attempted
to
set
in
motion
unlawful
prosecutions
of
the
plaintiffs
or
some
of
them
through
the
application
of
these
--
to
these
plaintiffs
of
the
aforesaid
statutes
of
the
state
of
illinois
and
ordinances
of
the
city
of
chicago.
now,
then
we
go
ahead
and
say
at
paragraph
25
found
in
page
12,
pursuant
to
this
plan
or
scheme,
the
defendants
have
attempted
to
threaten
and
continue
to
attempt
to
prosecute
the
plaintiffs
and
all
persons
associated
with
them
or
working
in
cooperation
therewith
under
color
and
authority
of
certain
statutes
namely,
and
we
set
forth
chapter
38
section
25
(a)
(1)
and
(2),
chapter
38
section
31-1,
chapter
38
section
12-2,
12-4,
12-6
which
is
the
one
that
where
before,
your
honors
on
and
certain
ordinances
of
the
city
of
chicago
to
wit,
chapter
193-1
and
chapter
11-33
said
statutes
and
ordinances
are
set
forth
in
an
appendix
marked
exhibit
“a”
etcetera.
now,
then
your
honors
--
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
well,
your
honor
we
later
alleged
on
those
complaints
that
the
statutes
on
their
face
were
--
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
we
do.
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
but
i'm
only
--
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
i
beg
to
differ
with
you,
your
honor.
i
think
it
does
because
i
think
that
as
said
by
this
court
in
golden,
you
have
to
take
all
the
facts
and
circumstances
into
account.
this
is
a
unique
case,
this
case
may
never
happen
again
in
a
hundred
years.
but
what
i'm
saying
is
that
you
have
to
go
back
in
time
and
i
am
asking
your
honors
to
do
this
on
your
own
mind
sight
to
1967
in
the
summer
in
chicago
and
ask
yourself
what
was
happening
to
those
people
then?
why
was
this
issue
standing
apparently
overlooked
by
the
district
court?
why
were
there
no
requirement
of
proof
by
the
court?
and
the
answer
was
obvious.
the
court
well
knew
what
was
happening
in
chicago
and
the
court
well
knew
and
perhaps
the
states
attorney
then
conceded
the
point
that
he
did
not
want
us
to
bring
in
our
evidence
of
what
the
threat
was
and
now
they
get
up
here
and
get
a
clean
shot
by
saying
the
threat
is
now
a
conclusion
instead
of
a
statement
of
fact.
your
honor,
i
say
that
when
we
say
we
were
threatened,
i
say
that
is
an
allegation
of
fact
in
our
complaint.
it
is
not
a
conclusion
of
law
and
i
am
saying
you
look
at
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
to
back
up
at
the
total
four
corners
of
the
complaint
to
say,
does
this
complaint
state
a
cause
of
action
upon
which
relief
can
be
granted?
and
in
the
federal
system,
i
understand
we
are
not
obligated
to
plead
evidence
but
to
plead
in
simple
language
the
fact
that
there
is
a
case
or
controversy
upon
which
the
court
is
asked
to
render
a
ruling.
and
i
am
saying
that
when
we
stood
before
that
three-judge
court,
there
was
in
fact
a
sincere
and
obvious
case
in
controversy
involving
the
mob
action
statute,
involving
the
resisting
arrest
statute
and
involving
ordinances
of
the
city
of
chicago.
now,
to
give
up
on
your
appeal
on
those
matters
on
the
merits
and
then
to
appeal
on
one
issue
and
one
issue
alone
would
say,
“look,
aha,
nobody
was
ever
charged
with
intimidation.
therefore
they
have
no
standing.
what
i
am
saying
that
it
would
be,
really
an
abuse
of
the
court
to
go
back
and
then
say
“we'll
now
arrest
somebody
and
we'll
now
go
back
to
this
arduous
process
to
get
at
the
intimidation
statute
which
is
obviously
on
its
face
back.”
it
would
be
just
like
surgeon
going
to
a
man's
abdominal
cavity
and
seeing
a
bad
appendix
when
he
is
in
there
for
something
else
and
then
closing
up
the
man
and
then
going
back
next
week
and
then
opening
up
the
abdominal
cavity
to
take
out
the
bad
appendix.
and
that
may
even
amount
to
medical
malpractice
but
i
am
saying
it
is
a
similar
situation
here.
it's
a
question
of
pendent
jurisdiction.
the
court
had
before
it
an
issue
that
had
the
jurisdiction
of
not
only
the
parties
but
of
the
subject
matter
involving
clearly
the
mob-action
statute
and
clearly
the
other
matters
that
were
before
the
court.
now
what
makes
this
case
unique
is
that
the
court
then
in
the
fact
of
pendent
jurisdiction
dealt
with
obvious
issue
and
took
care
all
of
our
ills
at
one
time
which
i
suggest
to
the
court
is
the
better
way
to
do
it.
then
they
come
up
and
say,
aha,
we
walked
in,
off
of
the
street
and
we
only
attacked
section
12-6
and
nobody
ever
threatened
us.
nobody
was
ever
arrested.
there
were
no
high
bonds.
there
was
none
of
this
background
and
ask
you
to
try
this
case
in
the
vacuum
and
i
say
it
cannot
be
argued
in
the
vacuum,
it
cannot
be
tried
in
a
vacuum
but
you
must
understand
that
what
the
court
did
in
my
humble
opinion
was
the
only
thing
it
could
have
done,
other
than
to
put
us
to
additional
expense
and
put
the
court
to
additional
time
with
additional
burdens
upon
the
court
and
upon
this
court.
now,
i
--
that
is
really
the
gravamen
of
my
argument
is
that
case
is
unique
and
that
our
standing
to
sue
stands
on
the
issue
of
pendent
jurisdiction.
we
were
properly
in
court
and
the
court
took
care
of
all
our
ills
and
the
court
in
fact
saved
itself
some
time
because
now
i
come
to
the
argument
which
is
even
the
states
attorney
wants
me
to
reach
and
that
is
that
on
the
face
of
this
particular
statute,
there
is
a
question
of
whether
or
not
it
was
in
fact
overbroad
or
vague.
and
i
submit
to
your
honor
that
it
was
both
and
the
court
in
its
opinion
written
by
three
judges
came
to
the
conclusion
that
it
was
both
overbroad
and
vague.
now,
here
is
the
problem
with
that
intimidation
statute.
the
problem
is
this,
whenever
you
take
an
intimidation
statute
or
extortion
statute
or
what
have
you,
and
you
put
it
on
the
political
arena
as
they
have
done
here
and
the
victim
of
that
alleged
crime
becomes
the
politicians
either
on
the
state
of
local
level
or
a
national
level.
then
you
have
really
set
the
collision
in
motion
of
the
right
of
our
society
to
deal
with
freedom
of
speech
on
an
ordered
liberty
and
the
right
of
people
to
be
free
from
threats.
well,
i
say
your
honor
as
you've
said
in
cases
involving
libel
and
slander
in
dealing
with
people
who
are
public
figures.
once
you
enter
the
public
arena,
you're
not
to
be
cuddled
and
protected
because
you
are
a
public
institution
and
so
when
i
say
that
you
cannot
say
that
these
politicians
are
so
frail
that
we
can't
tell
them
directly
or
indirectly
that
unless
you
redress
our
grievances,
we
will
do
less
insult.
now
this
brings
us
to
the
ill
in
the
statute,
that
section
which
the
court
found
to
be
overbroad
says
that
we
will
commit
in
a
crime
and
this
sends
us
back
not
only
to
the
criminal
code.
it
sends
us
back
to
all
regulatory
legislations
which
has
a
sanction
of
criminal
punishment
therein.
it
sends
us
back
to
all
the
ordinances
of
the
city
of
chicago
which
may
or
may
not
be
codified
which
have
sanctions,
and
i
submit
to
you
that
there
is
no
way
with
regard
to
vagueness
that
you
can
then
determine
when
you've
committed
a
crime
and
the
sanction
in
this
particular
section
is
five
years
imprisonment.
now,
the
crime
that
you
may
threaten
to
commit
if
it
goes
to
(inaudible)
may
only
be
fine
of
$25.00
or
maybe
up
to
a
year
in
jail
then
to
convert
speech
into
felony.
i
mean
this
is
really
what
we
are
talking
about
here.
you
are
dealing
with
politicians
and
you
say
now
by
threatening
a
politician
that
i
will
commit
a
crime
that
has
a
$25.00
penalty
and
now
i
can
get
five
years.
well,
obviously
we
were
chilled
by
this
and
there
was
a
chilling
effect
of
the
threat
of
this
that
we
have
to
beat
them
to
the
courthouse.
now
whether
or
not
we
were
too
fast
and
got
to
the
courthouse
first,
i
don't
think
your
honors
have
to
reach
that
because
we
were
properly
in
court
on
the
mob-action
statute
and
on
all
the
other
statutes
that
the
court
dealt
with
and
i
felt
that
and
i
feel
now
that
the
court
had
a
right
and
a
duty.
not
only
a
right
but
a
duty
to
deal
on
the
basis
of
pendent
jurisdiction
with
this
other
matter
and
there
was
an
actual
case
and
controversy
based
on
our
allegations
of
meetings,
threats
and
plans
and
also
these
facts
are
somewhat
important.
the
uniformed
charges
of
all
these
people
and
all
this
incidents,
you
see
there
are
four
charges
on
all
these
incidents
that
went
before
and
it
just
doesn't
happen
that
way
generally
unless
there
is
some
concerted
action
that
everybody
would
be
--
who
is
involved
in
this
type
of
matter
violates
four
charges
each
and
every
time
and
everybody
although
he
may
be
a
college
student
with
no
prior
record
has
a
bond
of
$10,000.00
set
against
him
and
he
stays
in
jail
for
ten
days
before
he
can
get
bond
or
get
it
load
in
a
petition
and
therefore
loses
time
in
school.
so,
i
am
saying
that
there
was
an
actual
case
or
controversy.
there
were
litigants
who
clearly
represented
the
rights
of
all
the
people
that
we
sued
on
behalf
of
and
whether
or
not
no
one
was
arrested
because
of
one
statute
that
had
been
threatened
to
be
used
in
the
future.
you
see
we
then
get
on
the
horns
of
the
dilemma
--
of
the
dilemma
2283
anti-injunction
statute
which
says
now
if
they
beat
you
to
court,
you
cannot
get
an
injunction;
if
you
beat
them
to
court,
you
have
no
standing.
now,
i
submit
your
honors
that
this
is
a
precarious
and
it
is
a
wrongful
position
of
the
people
to
be
put
in
because
as
advocates
of
really
the
first
amendment
freedom,
which
is
the
touchstone
of
our
very
democracy.
if
we
are
going
to
deny
by
this
dilemma,
the
court
system
and
the
judicious
use
of
the
court
system
because
i
recognize
also
that
we
cannot
inundate
this
court
with
this
types
of
cases
because
then
this
court
will
have
to
seize
to
function
because
it
will
be
shuffling
papers.
but
i
submit
that
is
an
apparent
but
unreal
fear
because
first
of
all
you
have
to
run
this
gauntlet.
you
have
to
go
through
a
three-judge
court
which
must
be
convened
by
a
single
judge
who
must
see
some
merit,
apparent
merit
in
your
complaint
before
he
will
even
convene
a
three-judge
court.
one
of
the
judges
sitting
on
that
three-judge
court
is
a
member
of
the
court
of
appeals.
now,
these
judges
or
at
least
the
majority
of
these
three
judges
must
then
rule
on
the
matter
before
the
matter
will
get
here
as
a
matter
of
right.
now
if
the
matter
is
frivolous
and
no
three-judge
court
is
convened
then
we
don't
have
a
matter
of
right
appeal
here.
we
would
then
have
to
go
to
the
court
of
appeals
if
it
was
not
frivolous
and
the
three-judge
court
decided
the
issue.
then
i
submit,
your
honor
that
you've
done
a
screening
device.
you've
got
a
three-judge
court
here
which
is
convened
and
then
the
matter
is
not
frivolous
and
then
your
honors
have
the
duty
to
hear
it
because
that
caveat
of
first
amendment
freedoms
that
we're
dealing
with.
i
cannot
emphasize
how
important
it
is
because
if
we
cut
off
that
valve
and
say
that
you
cannot
get
to
this
court
in
matters
of
freedom
of
speech,
redress
of
grievances,
peaceful
assembly.
and
i
am
not
talking
about
anarchy
and
i
am
not
talking
about
violence
or
anything
like
that.
i
am
talking
about
the
legitimate,
peaceful
first
amendment
rights
that
we
all
suggest
or
should
be
nurtured.
then
everybody
will
then
say,
“well,
if
i
cannot
use
the
courts,
what
is
my
next
remedy?”
and
the
next
remedy
may
well
be
that
we
then
all
have
to
become
revolutionaries
as
they
did
in
1776
and
overthrow
the
entire
government
because
the
courts
if
they
don't
give
you
a
remedy,
a
speedy
remedy,
an
open
remedy,
one
that
you
can
count
and
rely
on
as
advocates
and
lawyers,
then
i
suggest
you
what
do
you
tell
your
clients
when
they
say,
“the
doors
have
been
closed,
so
let's
take
to
the
streets”
and
as
with
that
in
mind
that
i
say
to
you,
you
have
a
duty
dombrowski.
i
must
say
when
i
read
the
opinion,
i
have
felt
that
it
was
a
long
time
coming
but
i
am
saying
you
have
no
right
in
light
of
what's
happening
today
to
turn
back
the
clock
with
respect
to
dombrowski.
you
have
the
duty
to
open
that
wire.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
basically,
to
begin
i'd
like
to
point
out
and
quote
from
the
page
8
of
my
brief
“legitimate
political
expression
intended
to
secure
changes
in
society's
legal,
political,
social,
or
economic
structure.
frequently,
takes
the
form
of
expressions
about
future
events
or
conditions
such
expression
may
be
in
the
form
of
promises,
predictions,
or
warnings,
or
threats
of
an
unlawful
--
threats
of
lawful
action.
now,
apparently
the
basis
of
this
appeal
is
that
the
court
below
deemed
it
inappropriate
to
circumscribe
a
threat
of
miniscule
illegal
activity
but
what
we
have
here
is
really
a
collision
between
the
right
of
certain
individuals
in
this
society
to
exercise
what
has
been
historical
and
classical
first
amendment
freedoms
and
the
right
of
a
state
to
protect
itself
and
to
protect
the
order
of
liberty
which
--
without
which
we
would
not
have
any
freedom
of
speech.
so,
we've
always
--
we
always
do
have
a
conflict
in
this
area
and
this
court
has
in
many
--
on
many
occasions
try
to
resolve
a
conflict
but
now
we
have
a
statute
before
this
court
which
the
state
contends
is
an
extortion
statute
in
the
classic
sense,
it
is
not.
this
statute
does
not
require
the
defendant
to
take
or
to
attempt
to
take
anything
of
value
from
the
purported
victim.
i
say
it's
not
an
extortion
statute.
it
is
overbroad
and
extortion
statute
could've
been
drawn
to
protect
a
state
against
that
evil
and
in
fact,
you
have
section
(a)
(1)
of
that
statute
which
is
not
here
on
appeal
and
which
would
remain
valid
which
says
of
course
the
threat
of
inflicting
physical
harm
on
the
person
threatened
or
any
other
person
or
on
property.
now,
if
they
want
to
protect
people
from
extortion,
i
say
well,
in
good
the
state
has
an
interest
in
that
which
is
substantial
but
when
you
deal
with
what
they
term
as
the
right
of
a
public
official
to
have
freedom
of
choice,
i
say
you
made
the
statute
so
broad
as
to
really
put
a
five
year
news
or
a
$5,000.00
fine
around
anyone's
neck
would
have
it
to
merit
to
publicly
utter
that
we
will
march
around
mayor
daley's
house
and
violate
let's
say
an
ordinance
which
would
maybe
cause
us
to
pay
a
hundred
dollar
fine
at
the
most.
now,
we
must
face
five
years
in
the
penitentiary
or
pay
a
forfeit
$5,000.00.
this
is
the
real
guts
of
this
particular
case.
the
statute
also
makes
criminal
the
threat
to
commit
a
criminal
offense
without
regard
to
the
degree
of
the
threat.
this
is
the
point
i'm
making.
in
other
words,
if
you
carry
out
the
threat
in
its
final
analysis
and
its
one
to
violate
a
misdemeanor
and
it
will
be
punishable
only
by
fine,
why
then
when
you
take
it
one
step
back
and
say,
i'm
going
to
do
this
tomorrow?
now,
you
face
five
years
in
the
penitentiary.
i
suggest
to
you
that
this
is
the
reason
that
the
court
below
struck
this
particular
portion
of
this
statute.
now,
--
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
yes.
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
that's
correct
and
i
think
that
--
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
that's
correct.
in
other
words,
in
every
form
of
let's
say
direct
action
protest
there
is
always
an
evil
that
you're
trying
to
get
rid
off
or
there
is
always
some
change
in
the
society
that
you're
trying
to
bring
above.
so
i'm
saying
that
this
statute
when
you
take
just
historical
direct
action
protest
it
elevates
what
has
been
the
exposure
of
using
misdemeanors
and
punishment
by
fine
or
short
detention
to
the
area
of
a
felony
and
i
think
that
it
puts
a
chill
on
legitimate
free
expression
of
ideas
and
a
chill
on
the
right
of
individuals
to
determine
that
they
will
do
something
in
a
way
to
bring
about
legitimate
change.
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
well,
in
--
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
yes
in
the
complaint,
we
alleged
a
scheme
and
we
alleged
a
conspiracy
and
alleged
the
chronology
of
events.
but
most
of
which
in
fact
all
of
which
took
place
in
1967.
there
were
a
series
of
mass
arrest
in
chicago
involving
about
three
or
four
incidents
separate
distinct
incidents.
there
are
seven
sub-classes
in
the
total
class
action
presented
to
the
court
below.
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
they
did
not
arrest
anybody
for
the
intimidation
statute
but
we
alleged
they
threatened
to
do
so
and
it
would
be
a
question
of
whether
or
not
we
could
prove
that
they
in
fact
threatened
to
use
this
particular
statute
but
we
were
going
to
prove
that
there
were
meetings
of
officials
and
they
have
set
about
a
scheme
of
high
bonds
and
to
use
everything
at
this
disposal
including
the
statute.
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
i
believe
we
did.
now,
whether
or
not
it
is
a
conclusion
as
my
opposing
counsel
said
i
would
say
that
we
alleged
it
as
a
fact
and
--
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
pursuant
to,
this
is
page
17
of
the
appendix
and
this
is
paragraph
34
of
the
complaint.
pursuant
to
the
aforesaid
plan
or
scheme,
defendants
have
threatened
to
continue
--
no,
strike
that,
have
threatened
and
continue
to
threaten
to
enforce
the
said
unconstitutional,
void
and
illegal
statutes
and
ordinances
against
the
plaintiffs
herein
for
the
sole
purpose
of
arresting,
intimidating,
subjecting
and
causing
to
be
subjected
plaintiffs
and
their
members.
now,
i
suggest
to
you
that
this
statement
met
all
of
the
statutes
including
the
intimidation
statute
and
i
would
like
to
point
out.
i
think
at
the
page
18
also
which
is
paragraph
37
(a)
where
we
alleged
as
a
result
of
those
threats.
now,
we
never
really
dug
down
to
the
factual
issues
because
we
felt
that
we
could
prove
that
there
were
meetings
of
the
chief
judge,
meetings
of
the
states
attorney's
office
and
that
they
had
gone
over
all
of
these
statutes
and
we
didn't
just
pull
the
statutes
on
that.
these
were
the
statutes
that
we
had
on
information
and
believed
that
they
were
going
to
use
in
the
scheme
of
dealing
with
so-called
mass
arrest
situations.
now,
we
alleged
that
threat.
now,
i
--
we
didn't
name
names
or
dates
and
meeting
places
--
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
that's
correct.
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
that's
correct.
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
well,
i
would
suggest
no.
no
one
ever
pointed
a
finger
at
us
and
said
they
were
going
to
do
it
directly
to
us.
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
no,
not
a
direct
threat
by
suggest
to
the
court
that
a
threat
can
be
just
as
ominous
if
it's
indirect
and
it
gets
back
to
you
by
a
third
party
as
if
the
finger
was
pointing
in
your
faces
that
we're
going
to
do
this
to
you.
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
but
the
question
here
is
one
of
standing
in
one
of
chill
and
one
of
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
yes,
but
i
would
--
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
well,
in
golden,
the
language
that
i've
picked
out
of
golden
states
that
the
difference
between
an
abstract
question
and
a
controversy
contemplated
by
the
declaratory
judgment
act
is
necessarily
one
of
degree
and
it
would
be
difficult
if
it
would
be
possible
to
fashion
a
precise
test
for
determining
in
every
case
whether
there
is
such
a
controversy.
basically,
the
question
in
each
case
is
whether
the
facts
alleged
under
all
these
circumstances
show
that
there
is
a
substantial
controversy
between
the
parties
having
adverse
legal
interest
of
sufficient
immediacy
and
reality
to
warrant
the
issuance
of
a
declaratory
judgment.
now,
i'm
asking
this
court
to
take
into
account
the
fact
that
you
have
to
look
at
all
of
the
facts
and
circumstances
as
to
what
is
alleged
in
the
complaint.
here,
we
have
had
experienced
with
the
circumstances
that
we
contend
with
or
that
we
contended
with
in
the
mass
arrest
circumstances.
we
have
under
gone
the
mass
arrest
of
60
people
some
of
which
were
on
their
front
porche.
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
what
is
it
your
honor?
i
didn't
under
the
question.
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
with
the
intimidation
statute
only.
actually,
no
one
was
ever
charged
so
we
had
no
experience
other
than
let's
say
an
indirect
threat
that
the
next
time
around
will
not
only
use
mob-action
but
we're
going
to
use
the
intimidation
statute
as
well.
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
yes.
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
i
would
say
when
--
whether
or
not
the
threat
is
indirect
or
direct
it
is
still
a
threat
and
either
i
am
going
to
be
chilled
in
my
feelings
that
i
can
go
out
and
exert
my
first
amendment
freedoms
or
not.
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
well,
i
would
suggest
this
was
more
than
rumor.
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
yes,
we
were
but
as
a
question
of
degree,
your
honor,
and
i'm
saying
we're
little
bit
closer
to
this
in
to
the
spectrum.
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
what
did
you
say?
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
i
didn't
hear
you.
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
did
we
just
find
statute?
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
well,
you
mean
so
far
as
our
drafting
the
complaint?
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
well,
i
would
suggest
it
didn't
start
from
our
end
as
to
which
statutes
we
were
going
to
sit
down
and
try
to
get
the
court
to
define
to
be
unconstitutional.
i
suggest
that
in
light
of
what
was
happening
and
in
light
of
what
we
felt
was
going
to
happen
to
our
plaintiffs
below
and
appellees
here
that
we
said
in
light
of
these
statutes
where
they
have
already
taken
action
and
we
have
this
history
behind
us
now
and
in
light
of
the
fact
that
we're
being
threatened
in
the
future
by
the
intimidation
statute,
let's
file
a
complaint
taking
care
what
has
gone
before,
the
mob-action,
disorderly
conduct
as
well
as
intimidation
because
we
want
perspective
relief
as
well
as
--
i
mean
you
know
as
well
as
dealing
with
history,
and
then
--
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
that's
correct.
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
well,
i'm
suggesting
to
the
court
that,
your
honors,
and
from
your
question
i
can
take
the
attitude
or
the
idea
from
that
that
you
feel
that
a
police
officer
must
first
come
down
or
a
state's
attorney
and
say,
i'm
going
to
charge
you
ellis
reid.
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
i
understand.
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
that's
correct
and
i
would
--
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
that
is
a
difference.
but
i'm
suggesting
that
even
though
that
is
the
difference
and
i
recognize
that
to
be
a
difference,
i'm
not
trying
to
minimize
that
i'm
saying
when
you
put
you
can't
try
this
case
in
a
vacuum
surely
if
you
said
nothing
else
that
happened
before.
you
might
be
right,
it
would
be
pretty
remote
but
when
you
have
the
chronology
and
the
dealing
with
the
plaintiffs
below
with
the
other
statutes
they
were
in
fact
applied.
i
think
that
they
--
the
threat
became
so
imminent
and
immediate
and
there
wasn't
actual
controversy
between
live
litigants
at
that
point
although
the
indictment
had
not
fall.
and
no
one
had
come
down
to
make
an
arrest.
i
still
think
although
we
were
in
court
perhaps
early
i
don't
think
we
were
in
court
too
early
as
to
make
the
issue
one
that
would
be
not
an
actual
case
of
controversy
and
i'm
asking
you
to
really
look
at
the
factual
circumstance
involving
the
mass
arrest
situation
where
the
use
of
the
statutes
and
we
cannot
divorce
this
statute
from
the
total
scheme
of
things.
i'm
saying,
it's
the
total
scheme
of
things.
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
i
did.
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
no,
they
came
up
on
a
motion
to
dismiss
before
judge
will
alone
and
it
was
denied.
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
that's
correct.
he
felt
that
there
was
subs
--
sufficient
allegations
to
state
a
claim
and
of
course
now
that
point
we
were
not
split
off
between
intimidation
mob-action,
disorderly
conduct
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
--
for
this
arrest.
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
other
than
on
--
in
some
other
circumstances
what
judge
will
termed
as
ad
hoc
hearings
involving
whether
or
not
he
would
enjoin
particular
prosecutions
which
came
at
a
subsequent
point
in
time.
there
were
of
course
facts
but
there
was
never
been
a
evidentiary
hearing
dealing
with
the
threat
or
the
nature
of
the
threat
involved
in
this
intimidation
statute.
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
that's
what
they're
saying
and
of
course
the
court
below
sought
our
way
that
it
was
substantial
and
it's
the
question
of
semantics
whether
or
not
this
is
a
conclusion.
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
that's
correct.
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
that's
the
issue
and
of
course
we
contend
that
in
the
totality
of
the
complaint
that
we
have
made
out
a
case
on
the
pleadings
when
you
read
the
complaint
as
a
whole
not
picking
out
certain
portions
and
forgetting
others
but
when
you
take
it
as
a
whole
that
we
have
stated
a
cause
of
action
upon
which
relief
could
be
granted
and
that's
the
way
the
case
was
presented
below
and
i
would
urge
the
court
to
deal
with
it
in
that
fashion
here.
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
well,
i
would
say
that
--
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
--
at
that
point,
we
did
not
really
get
to
an
evidentiary
hearing
because
basically
the
--
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
that's
correct.
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
that's
what
the
court
had
before,
yes.
but
specifically,
though
i
have
raised
the
point
in
my
brief
and
i
would
like
to
just
to
point
out
to
the
court
now
though
i
see
that
the
court
has
a
great
deal
of
interest
in
this
point
probably
in
light
of
golden.
but
i
perhaps
i
was
in
error
when
i
pointed
out
that
this
matter
comes
here
really
on
a
direct
appeal
and
in
their
jurisdictional
statement
it
is
our
contention
that
this
issue
was
not
fairly
complies
with
in
that
jurisdictional
statement
and
therefore
this
particular
issue
is
not
before
the
court.
now,
i'll
--
i
understand
that
if
the
court
wants
to
deal
with
this
as
a
jurisdictional
requisite
then
the
doctrine
of
waiver
may
not
apply
but
it's
our
contention
that
this
particular
standing
argument
has
been
waived
because
it
was
one
wherein
an
appeal
should've
been
taken
directly
to
the
court
of
appeals
because
it
was
based
on
a
decision
of
a
single
judge.
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
well,
that's
why
i'm
saying
if
that
is
a
matter
of
jurisdiction
then
i
would
say
that
it
would
not
be
one
that
could
be
waived
but
i
don't
feel
that
under
the
circumstances
here
that
it
would
be
a
matter
of
jurisdiction.
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
that's
what
based;
they
move
a
failure
to
state
of
claim
and
the
court
decided
against
it.
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
they
did
what?
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
well,
i
don't
have
a
copy
of
the
answer
before
me
now
but
and
of
course
unfortunately
mr.
tucker
below
argued
the
matter
--
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
yes.
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
that's
correct.
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
that's
correct,
for
those
purposes
and
they
have
never
really
--
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
that's
correct.
i
would
say
that
if
you
read
their
motion
to
dismiss
it
does
not
really
articulate
one
of
jurisdiction.
i
think
it's
found
beginning
at
page
30
of
the
appendix.
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
that's
correct
and
then
the
three-judge
court
ruled.
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
25
of
the
appendix?
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
let's
see.
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
no.
well,
basically,
no.
we
challenged
the
disorderly
conduct
ordinance
93-1
--
193-1.
we
challenged
the
mob-action
statute.
we
challenged
the
intimidation
statute
and
i
believe
the
resisting
arrest
ordinance
and
there
were
some
few
others
which
we
--
i
don't
have
a
copy
and
see
where
which
we
withdrew
more
or
less
are
challenged
for
the
court
below.
basically,
it
was
two
ordinances
and
two
statutes
and
that
were
challenged
below.
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
two
statutes
were
mob-action
and
the
intimidation
statute
which
is
before
this
particular
court.
the
other
ordinances
were
dealt
with
by
the
single
judge,
judge
will
below.
he
separated
them
saying
that
they
felt
that
it
was
not
for
a
three-judge
court
being
that
they
were
only
ordinances
of
lawful
application.
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
i
don't
know.
i
did
not
make
a
point
of
it,
i
read
it
but
i
really
--
i
guess
what
this
is
on
page
25
is
really
a
listing
of
the
grand
page
of
the
city
counsel
of
the
ordinances
that
fall
under
chapter
193
of
the
municipal
code
of
chicago
that
obviously
--
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
i
just
--
i
don't
think
this
was
attached
on
plaintiff.
we
said
out
if
i
have
the
--
i
have
not
looked
at
it.
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
well,
i
would
say
this
although
it
might've
been
it
was
just
an
index
or
maybe
all
of
the
available
ordinances
under
chapter
193
but
we
only
challenge
193
(voice
overlap).
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
well,
basically,
this,
i
guess
when
we
realize
that
many
of
these
ordinances
that
were
passed
was
specific
reasons
all
of
which
or
some
of
which
have
long
since
cease
to
have
any
meaning.
maybe
i
did
not
--
i
would
say
deal
with
this
particular
portion
of
a
complaint
and
i
don't
know
why
it
was
put
in
there.
maybe
it
was
to
show
that
they
have
many,
many
ways
to
control
us
and
what
we
specifically
were
dealing
with
disorderly
conduct.
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
well,
i
would
ask
the
court
to
reach
a
middle
ground
from
what
you've
said.
i
think
there
is
a
point
in
between
those
two
poles,
in
other
words,
i
would
agree
this
court
should
not
sit
to
hear
contrive
not
substantial
litigation
where
one
would
go
to
a
statute
book
and
dig
them
out.
but
i
think
also
we
should
not
in
the
area
of
the
first
amendment
freedoms
and
this
is
why
i
think
this
is
unique.
and
this
i
think
is
the
reason
for
dombrowski,
wait
until
someone
has
been
tried
and
convicted
before
they
would
have
standing
before
this
court.
i
think
that
this
particular
case
presents
a
factual
circumstance
of
that
middle
ground.
there
was
a
scheme
that
was
entered
into
and
upon
where
we
were
arrest,
where
we
were
intimidated,
where
we
were
thrown
into
jail
with
high
bonds
and
where
there
were
meetings
and
where
the
police
prosecutors
start
going
to
the
statute
book
and
we
heard
about
it
and
we
got
to
court
before
they
did.
now,
i
don't
think
that
we
lose
our
standing
by
beating
them
to
court
and
that's
what
the
issue
i'm
trying
to
impress
upon
this
court.
i
think
that
when
i
say
look
at
the
totality
of
the
chronology
of
events.
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
well,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
yes,
i
can
see
your
concern
but
again
i'm
saying
that
had
nothing
occurred,
had
no
one
been
arrested
other
than
the
many,
many
people
who
were
arrested
perhaps
you
would
be
right.
but
here,
we
had
a
serious
of
arrest,
mass
arrest
and
here,
we
had
all
be
--
other
statutes
and
ordinances
as
used.
it
showed
a
scheme
to
deal
with
this
type
of
protest
activity
in
a
certain
way.
i
think
then
we're
in
a
different
position
and
we
then
perhaps
and
i'll
urged
upon
the
court,
i
think
we
would
have
the
right
to
then
alleged
they're
not
only
going
to
use
the
ones
they've
already
arrested
us
on
but
we
might
it
call
it
pendent
jurisdiction
or
whatever
you
want
to
deal
with
but
i'm
saying
to
deal
--
to
get
away
from
securities
litigation.
that's
deal
with
the
total
problem
now
because
they
now
or
threaten
now
used
mob-action
in
disorderly
conduct.
they
have
threatening
to
use
intimidation
too.
so,
we
therefore
put
it
in
as
part
and
parcel
of
this
complaint
and
therefore
i
feel
that
the
court
below
had
jurisdiction
and
i
feel
that
as
i
stand
here
now,
i
have
standing
to
sue
and
to
the
right
to
attack
the
intimidation
statute
also
as
well
as
the
ones
that
we've
attacked
below
with
proper
standing
and
i'd
say
well,
with
no
allegation
below
that
we
did
not
have
proper
standing.
basically,
for
those
reasons
i'd
like
to
urge
that
the
court
affirmed
the
court
below
because
unless
we
have
a
basis
for
dealing
with
these
matters
with
in
the
framer
of
the
courts.
all
of
those
things
which
they
urged
about
taking
to
the
streets
in
a
righteous
way
may
come
to
pass.
and
i
would
suggest
that
when
we
tighten
the
news
around
people's
neck
and
it
become
frustrated.
they
have
no
way
to
go
but
the
mostly
illegal
way.
thank
you
for
listening.
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
--
may
it
please
the
court.
i'd
like
to
first
address
myself
to
the
standing
issue
and
then
to
the
issue
on
the
merits
of
whether
or
not
for
an
analysis
of
the
statute
it
was
over
broad
and
deterred
first
amendment
freedoms.
first
of
all,
i
think
mr.
bilton
got
himself
into
a
problem
with
the
standing
issue.
you
see
in
this
particular
case,
the
history
of
this
case
is
such
that
it's
here
only
on
one
particle
of
a
broad
problem
that
was
brought
to
court
below.
this
case
grew
out
of
a
situation
in
1967
where
there
were
five
mass
arrest
situations.
a
committee
of
22
lawyers
of
the
local
bar
and
some
from
out
of
town
got
together
basically
a
dombrowski
complaint,
taking
from
some
of
these
mass
arrest
situations,
sometimes
there
had
been
55
people
arrested
and
as
many
as
100
in
other
occasions
and
making
them
members
or
representatives
of
the
class.
we
have
here
seven
subclasses
of
the
total
class.
one
subclass
was
arrested
as
a
group
on
august
01,
1967
charged
with
mini
crimes,
mob
action
and
disorderly
conduct
being
the
main
ones.
another
group
was
arrested
on
may
21th,
1967
also
charged
with
mob
action
and
disorderly
conduct
and
resisting
arrest
and
a
few
other
charges.
september
14th,
1967,
another
group
was
arrested
and
charged
with
mob
action,
disorderly
conduct
and
resisting
arrest.
now,
--
then
again,
on
august
23rd,
1967,
another
group
was
arrested
and
charged
with
mob
action,
resisting
arrest
and
disorderly
conduct.
and
then
to
round
off
this
particular
plus
--
also
in
august
4th,
1967,
another
group
was
arrested
and
charged
with
mob
action,
disorderly
conduct
and
i
believe
also
resisting
arrest.
now,
we
added
also
a
group
known
as
act
which
was
an
incorporated
association
which
more
or
less
advocated
the
confrontation
of
public
issues
in
a
forum
of
the
streets.
we
also
added
as
members
of
the
class
individuals
who
had
not
been
arrested
and
charged
with
anything,
but
merely
were
negroes
who
wanted
to
speak
out
against
what
was
happening
in
the
city
of
chicago
at
that
time
in
1967
and
we
put
them
in
the
class
and
alleged
that
their
first
amendment
rights
were
being
chilled
by
this
particular
plan
of
action
that
was
being
perpetrated
by
the
city
of
chicago
on
people
of
arresting
them
with
no
hope
of
convictions,
with
high
bonds
and
keeping
them
in
jail.
sometimes
two
weeks
before
we
could
go
in
on
motions
to
reduce
the
bail
or
could
get
them
out
by
raising
the
bail.
now,
this
court
in
the
golden
v.
zwickler
case
set
the
following
language
with
regard
to
issue
of
standing,
although
there
probably
they
were
addressing
--
you
were
addressing
yourselves
to
the
issue
of
mootness.
but
you
said
the
difference
between
an
abstract
question
and
a
controversy
contemplated
by
the
declaratory
judgment
act
is
necessarily
one
of
degree
and
it
would
difficult
if
it
would
be
possible
to
fashion
a
precise
test
for
determining
in
every
case
whether
there
is
such
a
controversy.
basically,
the
question
in
each
case
is
whether
there
is
a
substantial
controversy
between
parties
having
adverse
legal
interest
of
sufficient
eminence,
immediacy
and
reality
to
warrant
the
issuance
of
a
declaratory
judgment
and
you
cited
in
support
of
that
the
maryland
case
and
the
company
case.
now,
in
this
particular
case,
you
have
to
know
something
about
the
city
of
chicago
in
order
to
understand
how
the
intimidation
statute
gets
here.
the
city
of
chicago
has
a
large
corporation
of
counsel's
office
which
is
charged
with
admitting
instances
among
other
things,
the
enforcement
of
the
city's
ordinances.
and
in
1967,
a
gentleman
named
richard
elrod
who
later
became
a
state
legislator
with
who
was
at
that
time
in
the
ordinance
enforcement
division
of
the
corporation
of
counsel's
office
was
present
at
every
major
demonstration
in
the
city
of
chicago.
and
he
was
the
man
on
the
scene
charged
with
the
duty
of
telling
the
chicago
police
who
they
would
arrest,
when
they
would
affect
the
arrest,
and
what
charges
would
be
brought
against
the
alleged
defendants.
now,
he
was
present
at
each
and
every
one
of
these
instances
that
i
quoted
to
you
in
the
complaint
of
the
five
groups
of
people
that
were
arrested.
some
50
people
sometimes
and
sometimes
as
many
as
a
hundred
people
in
these
mass
arrest
situations.
now,
it
was
richard
elrod
who
dreamed
of
the
notion
to
later
use
the
intimidation
statute
which
didn't
carry
just
a
year
in
jail
and
would
carry
five
years
in
jail.
and
when
we
as
lawyers
representing
these
people
that
were
on
this
threat
we
beat
him
to
the
courthouse
because
we
did
not
want
anybody
charged
with
a
felony
that
carried
five
years
for
merely
protesting
in
a
peaceful
way
and
trying
to
seek
a
readdress
of
their
grievances.
now,
the
reason
that
the
standing
issue
was
not
raised
in
the
jurisdictional
statement
and
the
reason
it
just
came
up
in
the
brief
of
these
particular
appellants
is
that
there
were
several
groups
of
people
below.
the
state's
attorney's
office
represented
the
defendants
who
were
county
officials
and
the
corporation
counsel's
office
represented
the
defendants
who
were
city
officials.
and
richard
elrod
of
course
was
the
corporation
counsel,
the
assistant
in-charge
of
defending
the
city
officials
and
it
was
richard
elrod
i
tell
you
who
dreamed
up
the
intimidation
statute.
so,
the
issue
never
came
up
because
when
the
lawyers
who
tried
the
case
and
i'm
one
of
the
last
of
the
22
that
are
stuck
with
this
case,
we're
in
court
with
mr.
elrod
and
with
the
other
lawyers
who
represented
the
county
officials,
obviously,
the
issue
never
came
up
because
we
knew
and
everybody
else
knew
that
there
was
a
substantial
controversy
about
this
intimidation
statute
that
mr.
elrod
wanted
to
use
it
and
we
be
in
the
court
and
the
three-judge
court
agree
that
as
the
statute
was
perverted
or
could
be
read
it
was
quite
a
chilling
effect
and
had
a
chilling
effect
on
first
amendment
freedoms.
now,
mr.
bilton
has
so
appeared
and
told
you
about
taking
money
from
somebody.
i
want
to
tell
you
how
the
statute
was
intended
to
be
used
and
how
you
can
read
it
and
in
plain
english
it
would
stick.
when
you
make
a
victim
or
a
so-called
a
victim
of
that
particular
statute,
a
public
official
and
then
you
read
the
statute
that
you
will
threaten
him
in
order
to
get
him
to
do
something
or
to
fail
to
do
something
by
permitting
a
crime
then
i
submit
to
you,
you
have
to
read
the
entire
criminal
code
of
the
state
of
illinois
and
also
the
ordinances
of
the
city
of
chicago
and
all
of
the
other
municipalities
in
the
state
of
illinois
to
determine
whether
or
not
they
are
threatening
a
crime.
for
example,
as
the
three-judge
court
said,
if
you
say
to
a
public
official,
either
you
will
readdress
our
grievances
or
we
will
picket
the
city
hall.
now,
if
there
is
an
ordinance
in
the
city
of
chicago
that
prohibits
the
picketing
of
the
city
hall,
you
have
just
put
yourself
in
a
five-year
nuisance
to
stand
trial
for
the
intimidation
statute.
and
that
is
why
we
are
here
and
that
is
why
the
three-judge
court
said
clearly,
this
statute
as
read
and
it
can
be
read
that
way
is
a
quite
a
chilling
statute
so
far
as
first
amendment
freedoms
are
concerned.
and
the
court
itself
went
to
several
examples
which
i
can
quote
if
i
can
find
the
examples
of
people
blocking
an
intersection
with
baby
carriages
or
people
deciding
to
do
things
which
in
and
off
themselves
would
be
misdemeanors
if
carried
through
to
fruition
and
because
you've
threatened
to
do
a
misdemeanor
to
bring
a
public
official
into
the
public
forum
to
do
what
he
should
do
then
you
are
charged
with
a
crime
that
carries
with
a
five-year
penalty.
and
i
say
to
you
that
this
statute
on
its
face
is
void
because
it
is
over
broad
and
as
your
honors
got
into
the
question
with
mr.
bilton,
there
are
many
other
statutes
in
the
state
of
illinois
and
many
other
ordinances
of
the
city
of
chicago
which
deal
with
conduct
that
may
be
antisocial
or
may
create
harm
to
property
or
to
persons.
i
say
to
you
this
is
not
such
a
statute
as
it
is
presently
drafted.
and
another
thing
back
on
the
standing
issue,
mr.
elrod
himself
when
he
became
a
member
of
the
legislature
after
the
initial
three
judge
opinion
in
this
case
entered
into
the
state
legislature
and
had
passed
a
bill
repealing
this
particular
statute.
and
i
don't
know
today
whether
or
not
the
governor
has
signed
that
repealer
bill,
but
i
do
know
that
a
letter
was
sent
to
the
governor's
office
asking
him
to
hold
up
on
signing
the
repealer
because
it
would
moot
the
issues
before
the
court
today
and
i
say
to
you
that
what
we
are
doing
here
in
this
issue
of
statute
--
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
they
don't
appear
in
the
record
because
the
last
time
i
was
here
to
argue
the
case
i
didn't
know
that.
i
found
out
after
the
first
argument
of
this
case.
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
well,
i
think
we
would
stipulate
to
the
court
that
a
bill
was
introduced
and
passed
by
the
illinois
legislature
of
course
it's
a
fact,
repealing
this
section
of
the
intimidation
act
of
the
state
of
illinois.
now,
i
don't
know
today
whether
or
not
the
governor
has
signed
that
bill.
but
i'm
saying
the
gentleman
who
dreamed
up
this
idea,
richard
elrod
introduced
and
passed
and
saw
that
the
bill
was
passed.
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
well,
there
is
basically
i
maybe
--
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
mr.
elrod
was
the
assistant
corporation
counsel.
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
oh,
i
understand.
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
that
is
not
in
the
record
and
other
than
the
fact
that
if
you
read
the
record
you
may
see
that
mr.
eldrod
was
a
party
to
this
lawsuit
so
far
as
representing
some
of
the
defendants
who
are
not
here
and
they
would
be
the
city
officials.
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
only
by
our
complaint
and
our
complaint
is
that
the
threat
was
made
and
it's
a
question
of
whether
or
not
the
word
threat
is
a
conclusion
argued
by
counsel
or
whether
it's
a
fact.
and
i'm
saying
to
you
that
the
threat
as
used
in
the
complaint
to
paragraph,
aid
of
the
complaint
and
again
i
believe
24
of
the
complaint,
25
of
the
complaint,
paragraph
34
of
the
complaint
and
paragraph
37
of
the
complaint
where
we
also
say
in
all
these
paragraphs
that
we
have
been
threatened
by
the
use
of
these
statutes
and
the
threatened
used
of
other
statutes
that
have
not
yet
been
used.
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
but
the
question
--
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
that's
correct.
the
only
thing
i'm
saying
to
you
is
--
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
i'm
saying
that
there
is
--
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
no,
no
and
the
reason
is
this
question
didn't
even
come
up
in
the
jurisdictional
statement
in
this
court
in
violation
of
your
rule
15.1
(c)
and
i
make
that
a
point
in
my
brief.
in
my
brief
i
say
the
question
was
not
set
forth
from
jurisdictional
statement
or
fairly
compliance
therein
as
required
by
rule
15.1
(c)
of
this
court.
then
i
go
on
to
say
the
question
was
one
decided
by
a
single
judge
from
whose
decision
an
appeal
must
be
taken
to
the
court
of
appeals.
now,
they
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
and
that's
in
the
record.
that
motion
to
dismiss
was
denied
by
judge
will,
sitting
as
one
judge
before
he
convened
the
three-judge
court.
i'm
saying
that
they
at
that
point
had
a
right
to
appeal
that
decision
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit.
they
choose
not
to
appeal
and
then
when
the
three-judge
court
was
convened,
they
went
ahead
and
if
the
three-judge
court
decided
that
on
the
face
of
this
particular
statute
it
was
over
broad
and
therefore
unconstitutional.
now,
i'm
saying
that
when
you
have
a
situation
like
this
where
standing
was
never
raised
and
i
did
and
i
must
apologize,
though
all
aside
of
the
record,
maybe
to
force
the
record
to
give
you
the
background
of
this
thing,
show
you
the
reason,
the
explanation
for
this.
it
was
never
raised
in
the
district
court
before
judge
will,
an
appeal
was
never
taken
on
the
issue
to
the
seventh
circuit
and
then
when
the
statute
was
knocked
out
on
its
face,
then
for
the
first
time
in
their
brief,
even
after
filing
the
jurisdictional
statement
as
an
afterthought,
perhaps
and
this
was
before
the
golden
case,
they
decided
that
perhaps
they
would
have
shot
at
us
before
this
court
because
of
standing
because
no
one
was
ever
charged
actually
with
the
violation
of
the
intimidation
statute.
what
i'm
saying
to
you
as
you
said
in
the
golden
case,
you
must
look
at
the
totality
of
all
the
circumstances
before
the
court.
you
cannot
just
pull
out
one
element
of
this
case.
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
that's
correct.
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
well,
that
maybe
the
way
to
read
it.
the
only
thing
i'm
saying
is
--
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
the
only
thing
i'm
saying
is
--
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
right.
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
may
i
answer
that
this
way
your
honor?
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
that
is
whether
or
not
you
read
the
word
"threat"
as
being
an
allegation
of
fact
or
as
you
read
it
as
a
conclusion
by
the
pleader.
now,
i
say
to
your
honor,
you
have
a
perfect
right
to
read
that
as
a
pleading
of
fact
because
it
is
a
fact
that
we
were
threatened
with
the
use
of
this
statute
and
it
is
a
pleading
of
a
fact.
we
were
threatened
by
the
use
of
this
statute
and
there
is
a
probably
a
problem
in
some
matters
as
to
whether
or
not
you
will
understand
the
word
as
you
hear
a
threat
to
be
a
conclusion.
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
well,
there
must
be
very
clear
and
present
danger
and
apparent
ability
to
carry
out
a
threat
and
i
went
through
the
record
only
to
explain
that
the
person
who
made
the
threat
was
present
in
court.
when
i
make
a
threat
i
have
the
apparent
ability
to
carry
out
the
threat
and
so
i
say
---
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
i
understand
your
honor,
but
may
i
say
this,
your
honor
does
not
have
to
go
outside
the
record
to
deal
with
this
case
and
i
will
show
you
your
honors
how
you
don't
have
to
do
that.
in
this
particular
case,
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
there
is
standing
is
a
factual
issue.
and
although
it
may
result
in
a
conclusion
that
may
have
jurisdictional
effects,
i'm
still
saying
that
initially
it
was
a
factual
determination
to
be
made
initially
by
the
district
judge
and
i'm
saying
your
honors
that
it
was
in
fact
made
and
that
it
was
conceded
and
that
either
it
was
waived
and
i'm
saying
that
your
honors
(voice
overlaps)
--
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
that's
correct
your
honor
but
that
of
course
is
the
ultimate
for
using
the
word
(voice
overlaps)
--
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
--whether
or
not
there's
a
sufficient
case
of
controversy,
but
(voice
overlaps)
judgment
and
i'm
only
saying
standing
as
a
short
pen
method
of
saying
that.
well,
i'm
saying
that
--
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
they
were
chilled
and
their
first
amendment
rights
were
--
but
whenever
you
do
this
your
honor
at
the
back
i'm
saying
there
is
a
distinct
difference
that
this
court
has
recognized
in
this
particular
area
between
cases
that
deal
with
the
first
amendment
freedoms
and
all
other
classes
of
cases.
now,
and
the
reason
for
that
is
quite
important.
if
we
don't
have
an
effective
and
quick
method
to
effectively
deal
with
and
protect
first
amendment
freedoms
--
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
--
(inaudible)
will
not
--
they'll
be
dead
when
you
get
to
this
court
in
the
wrong
way.
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
no,
your
honor,
this
--
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
well,
they
might
be
put
in
and
you
might
even
say
that
they
came
in
under
pendent
jurisdiction
and
we
have
the
substantial
controversy
between
the
first
five
groups
--
the
people
who
were
arrested.
there's
no
question
that
there
was
a
substantial
controversy
going
on
at
that
time
between
the
mass
arrest
situations
and
the
city
of
chicago.
now,
all
that
controversy
as
a
result
of
what
was
happening
to
the
people
that
were
arrested.
in
our
humble
opinion
they
were
the
people
who
were
standing
on
the
sidelines,
who
might
have
wanted
to
picket,
who
were
not
picketing
because
they
felt,
oh
look
what's
happening
to
these
people,
there
in
there
picketing
and
they're
getting
the
heads
beat
in
and
they're
being
arrested
and
they're
being
kept
in
jail.
now,
why
should
i
go
out
there
and
picket
peacefully
and
go
to
jail
for
two
weeks
before
i
can
even
post
bond.
now,
it
is
these
people
that
i
think
this
court
should
address
itself
too
because
it
is
these
people
who
then
after
seeing
the
suppression
of
the
other
people
who
are
the
activists,
stand
silent
and
stand
to
moot
and
that's
the
danger
to
order
liberty
and
that
is
the
sole
reason
why
this
court
has
made
a
distinction
between
first
amendment
cases
and
all
other
cases.
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
no,
mr.
judge,
i
was
speaking
fast
then
you
came
out.
i
apologize
for
there's
nothing
in
this
record.
these
people
were
arrested,
they
were
held
on
bond
as
the
record
shows
and
they
were
later
discharged
and
we're
saying
that
because
these
people
in
the
first
five
subclasses
were
dealt
with
in
this
manner
with
no
--
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
in
this
particular
case,
there
were
four
or
five
groups
arrested
and
we
picked
some
of
the
people
out
of
these
groups
as
representative
of
the
class.
now,
we
added
it
and
in
an
answer
to
justice
marshall's
answered
question,
people
who
were
never
arrested,
but
who
wanted
to
speak
out
and
use
speech
in
all
of
the
matter.
now,
i'm
saying
to
the
court
that
this
--
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
yes,
in
that
point
your
honor
which
starts
--
in
the
appendix
started
at
page
four,
paragraph
8
plaintiff
lawrence
--
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
it's
in
the
complaint.
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
it
was
--
no,
paragraph
8
i
think
was
denied.
no,
paragraph
8
was
admitted
i
believe
and
we
find
the
answer.
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
in
any
event,
there
was
no
question
about
who
the
subclasses
were.
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
mr.
bilton
has
to
be,
no.
he
said
the
bill
has
been
--
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
the
bill
has
a
veto.
i
just
got
this
note
from
mr.
bilton
two
minutes
ago.
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
so,
it
is
not
moot,
but
the
only
thing
i'm
saying
is
that
when
you
look
at
whether
or
not
there
is
a
case
in
controversy,
i
think
you
have
to
relax
your
standard
so
far
as
first
amendment
cases
are
concerned
because
this
court
has
said
and
i
think
that
we
can't
cross
over
this,
that
we
are
not
really
dealing
so
much
with
the
people
that
want
to
break
the
law.
there
are
statutes
on
the
books
that
are
available
to
give
these
people
their
just
rights
and
to
put
them
in
jail,
commensurate
with
the
crime
that
they
have
perpetuated
in
their
actions.
but
when
they
backup
a
step
and
say
that
when
you
use
language
and
you
verbalize
your
grievances
open
in
a
public
forum
and
you
address
them
to
a
public
official
and
you
say,
"do
something
for
us
please
or
we
will
do
x"
and
it
turns
out
that
analysis
of
all
the
statutes
they're
been
contemplating
x
is
applied,
that
you're
then
subject
to
five
years
imprisonment.
i
say
this
runs
smack
down
into
what
we
are
trying
to
start
out
with
in
this
country
of
having
truly
conflicting
interests
balanced
and
i'm
saying
that
they're
always
on
a
collision
course
that
anytime
that
you
take
to
the
public
forum
and
say,
"do
something
for
us
--"
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
okay.
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
at
this
point
just
digress
and
point
out
to
your
honors
the
problem
i
think
that
was
bothering
this
particular
court
and
that
is
that
i
feel
and
i
have
a
feeling
that
you
have
a
fear
of
being
inundated
by
this
type
of
case.
if
you
relax
the
standing
required
in
a
declaratory
judgment
action
to
the
degree
that
we
feel
is
necessary
in
order
to
protect
first
amendment
freedoms,
but
i
would
like
to
say
two
things
and
try
to
make
this
clear
to
the
court
so
that
you
understand
it
from
really
a
practicing
lawyer's
point
of
view,
one
who
is
concerned
with
first
amendment
freedoms.
first
of
all,
i
would
like
to
say
to
you
what
i
feel
would
have
happened
had
the
state
in
this
particular
proceeding
one
to
race
to
the
courthouse.
now,
it
has
been
called
in
many
circles
that
this
is
the
so-called
race
to
the
courthouse
whether
or
not
the
state
will
file
the
charge
or
whether
we
will
get
to
court
and
ask
for
declaratory
judgment
on
these
over
broad
statutes
first
in
federal
forum.
i
like
to
say
that
this
is
from
the
lawyer's
point
of
view,
had
the
state
in
this
particular
proceeding
won
the
race
to
the
courthouse
in
addition
to
the
complex,
legal,
and
factual
issues
that
i
have
had
to
address
myself
to
hear,
myself
to
hear
over
the
last
three
years.
i
would
have
then
had
to
deal
with
in
another
forum
also
the
issue
of
bail,
the
issue
of
defense
in
a
criminal
case,
the
issue
of
being
prepared
to
try
the
case
if
it
was
not
enjoined
and
also
the
anti-injunction
statute
in
the
federal
system.
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
well,
i'm
saying
it
does
not
have
to
be
for
the
future.
we
have
a
problem
here
and
i
think
that
the
court
is
trying
to
address
itself
to
that
problem
because
in
dombrowski
and
in
zwickler,
this
court
said
that
it
would
be
enough
to
have
a
threat
of
arrest
under
the
proper
facts
and
circumstances.
and
i
detect
from
not
only
some
of
the
questions
today,
but
the
previous
time
i
argued
this
case
that
this
court
also
is
dealing
in
its
own
mind
with
the
floodgate
problem
and
that
is
whether
or
not
it
should
be
inundated
with
this
type
of
litigation
if
we're
able
to
sit
back
in
our
office
and
go
through
the
criminal
code
and
say,
"that's
a
good
statute,
that's
a
bad
statute.
we'll
file
a
suit
on
the
bad
statutes
and
then
come
to
court."
i
don't
think
it's
going
to
happen
that
way
because
these
cases
are
expensive.
these
cases
are
varietous
and
they
take
as
you
can
see
in
this
case
three
to
four
years
of
a
lawyer's
time
and
that's
one
issue.
but
on
the
other
hand,
if
the
state
wins
the
race
to
the
courthouse
and
there
is
a
threat
and
we
have
to
wait
even
though
they
are
threatening
us
like
today
to
file
a
suit
tomorrow
and
then
we
have
to
wait
until
tomorrow
when
suit
is
actually
filed,
then
in
addition
to
the
complex
problems
in
this
type
of
case,
in
this
federal
forum
i'm
also
put
to
the
task
of
dealing
with
the
complex
legal
and
factual
issues
in
the
state
court.
so,
i'm
saying
to
your
honors
that
the
floodgate
argument
that
might
be
thrust
upon
you
today
will
be
found
to
be
wanting
in
this
particular
type
of
case
because
it
is
a
very
burdensome
type
of
litigation.
and
number
one,
you
must
get
one
judge
of
a
district
court
to
hear
your
case,
look
at
your
complaint
and
decide
whether
or
not
in
his
discretion
he
will
convene
a
three-judge
court
as
was
done
in
this
case
and
motions
for
this
dismissal
of
your
complaint
may
be
found
as
they
were
found
in
this
case.
and
i
like
to
point
out
that
these
issues
were
met
ahead
on,
on
a
motion
to
dismiss
filed
in
this
particular
case
and
i'd
like
to
in
the
time
i
have
remaining
address
myself
to
four
portions
of
the
appendix
which
i
think
are
important,
which
are
four
specific
portions
of
the
three-judge
court's
opinion.
now,
at
page
57
of
the
appendix
the
court
said
as
follows.
it
said,
"plaintiff's
filed
their
complaint
on
october
27th,
1967.
simultaneously,
they
moved
that
a
three-judge
court
be
convened
to
hear
and
determine
the
issues
presented
therein.
shortly
thereafter
both
the
state
and
city
defendants
moved
to
dismiss,
contending
interalia
that
the
complaint
failed
to
disclose
a
basis
for
equitable
relief
and
the
adoption
of
federal
abstention
should
be
utilized
to
allow
the
state
courts
an
opportunity
to
adjudicate
the
issues
presented
in
the
complaint.
an
opinion
dealing
with
these
motions
was
issued
on
december
28,
1967.
the
defendant's
motion
to
dismiss
were
denied."
now,
at
page
62
of
the
same
opinion,
it's
found
on
page
62
of
the
appendix,
the
court
there
said
as
follows,
"the
principles
announced
by
the
supreme
court
in
dombrowski
and
zwickler
appear
clearly
applicable
in
the
instant
case.
plaintiffs
claim
that
statute
is
invalid
because
of
vagueness,
indebtedness
and
over
breadth,
have
been
used
by
defendants
in
furtherance
of
a
scheme
to
discourage
plaintiff's
legitimate
exercise
of
first
amendment
rights.
in
dombrowski,
the
court
indicated
that
defense
in
a
state
criminal
prosecution
is
not
sufficient
to
correct
either
of
these
evils.
arrest,
detention,
and
threats
of
prosecution
may
have
an
interim
effect
on
free
expression
where
prosecutions
are
instituted
in
bad-faith
in
furtherance
of
a
scheme
to
discourage
protected
activities,
the
ultimate
success
of
the
defendant
does
not
alter
the
impropriety
of
the
unconstitutional
scheme.
the
adjudication
simply
resolves
the
guilt
or
innocence
of
the
defendant.
it
does
not
purge
the
scheme
of
its
impact
upon
federally
protected
rights."
and
then
at
page
94,
the
same
court,
the
three
judges
continues
and
they
say
there,
"the
provision
is
not
vague.
it
is
however
over
broad,
i
am
speaking
now
of
the
particular
statute,
since
it
prohibits
threats
of
insubstantial
evil,
the
commission
of
criminal
offenses
against
persons
or
property
is
a
substantial
evil
and
the
state
may
legitimately
proscribe
the
making
of
threats
to
commit
such
offenses.
the
commission
of
offenses
against
public
order
only
however
is
not
such
a
substantial
evil
that
the
state
may
prohibit
the
threat
of
it."
and
then
they
go
on
to
deal
with
the
statute
to
show
examples
as
to
how
you
can
commit
disorderly
conduct
and
because
of
this
statute
end
up
with
five
years
imprisonment.
now,
back
--
i'd
like
to
go
back
on
page
84
of
the
appendix,
page
88
excuse
me
where
the
court
points
out
this
and
i
think
this
is
important.
on
page
88
and
they
say,
"however,
at
the
outset
of
this
analysis
it
should
be
recognized
that
illinois
has
no
legitimate
interest
in
proscribing
as
intimidation
statements
that
have
no
reasonable
tendency
to
coerce
or
statements
which
although
alarming
are
not
expressions
of
an
intent
to
act.
legitimate
political
expression
intended
to
secure
a
changes
in
a
society's
legal,
political,
social,
or
economic
structure
frequently
to
take
the
form
of
expressions
about
future
events
or
conditions.
such
expressions
may
be
in
the
form
of
promises,
predictions,
or
warnings
or
threats
of
lawful
action.
and
i
know
my
time
is
up
but
i
like
to
say
here
this
is
the
trust
of
this
particular
statute
that
we
contend
as
unconstitutional
and
because
of
that
we
feel
this
court
has
a
duty
to
affirm
the
court
below.
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i'd
like
to
begin
my
answering
argument
by
some
observation
in
light
of
the
fact
that
no
matter
has
been
argued
twice
before
and
in
light
of
the
fact
there
are
four
cases
here
which
is
apparent
that
we
are
dealing
with
the
cases
that
began
with
dombrowski
versus
pfister.
and
the
issue
here
is
whether
or
not
in
the
case
before
the
court
we
have
standing
to
sue.
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
in
dombrowski,
the
court
said
in
his
opinion
and
i'm
quoting
from
his
language
because
i
think
it's
important
to
--
really
the
background
of
my
argument.
the
assumption
that
defense
of
a
criminal
prosecution
will
generally
assure
ample
vindication
of
constitutional
rights
is
unfounded
in
such
cases
and
it
cites
baggett
versus
bullitt.
for
the
threat
of
sanctions
may
deter
almost
as
potentially
as
the
actual
application
of
sanctions.
because
of
the
sensitive
nature
of
constitutionally
protected
expression,
we
have
not
required
that
all
of
those
subject
to
overbroad
regulations
risk
prosecution
to
test
their
rights
for
free
expression
of
transcendent
value
to
all
society
and
not
merely
to
those
exercising
their
rights
might
be
the
loser.
we
have
fashioned
this
exception
to
the
usual
rules
governing
standing
and
that's
at
united
states
versus
raines.
because
of
the
danger
of
tolerating
in
the
area
of
first
amendment
freedoms,
the
existence
of
a
penal
statute
acceptable
to
--
of
sweeping
and
improper
application
citing
naacp
versus
button.
if
the
rule
were
otherwise,
the
contours
of
regulation
would
have
to
be
hammered
out
case
by
case
and
tested
only
by
those
hardy
enough
to
risk
criminal
prosecution
to
determine
the
proper
sculpt
of
regulation.
now
it
is
with
that
in
mind,
your
honors,
that
i
further
point
out
to
the
court
the
language
in
golden
versus
zwickler
as
follows:
“the
difference
between
an
abstract
question
and
a
controversy
contemplated
by
the
declaratory
of
judgment
act
is
necessarily
one
of
degree.
and
it
would
be
difficult
if
it
would
be
possible
to
fashion
a
precise
test
for
determining
in
every
case
whether
there
is
such
a
controversy.”
basically,
the
question
in
each
case
is
whether
the
facts
alleged
under
all
the
circumstances
show
that
there
is
a
substantial
controversy
between
parties
having
adverse
legal
interest
of
sufficient
immediacy
and
reality
to
warrant
the
issuance
of
a
declaratory
judgment
citing
maryland
casualty
company
versus
pacific
oil.
now,
your
honors,
with
those
two
cases
in
mind,
i
address
your
attention
to
what
has
been
characterized
as
our
dombrowski-type
complaint.
and
i
ought
to
say
to
you
your
honors
as
it
has
come
out
here,
the
particular
injunction
involved
here
as
can
be
seen
from
page
104
of
the
appendix,
did
not
only
deal
with
chapter
38
section
12-6
of
illinois
criminal
code.
it
dealt
with
chapter
38
section
25-1(a)
(2),
chapter
38
section
12-6
(a)
(3).
and
also
your
honors,
which
this
injunction
did
not
deal
with
but
another
one
issued
by
a
single
judge,
judge
welt,
dealt
with
two
ordinances
of
the
city
of
chicago.
now,
the
background
of
this
case
is
as
follows:
in
1967,
there
were
a
series
of
arrest
and
we'd
like
to
point
out
to
you,
your
honors
the
facts
involved
in
this
particular
case.
we
have
alleged,
your
honors,
in
our
–
well,
it's
in
the
record
i'll
give
you
the
page
number
for
each
particular
circumstance.
but
starting
with
page
12
and
paragraph
27
of
our
complaint,
we
deal
there
with
a
mass
arrest
situation
that
occurred
on
the
first
day
of
august
1967
and
certain
plaintiffs
were
arrested
and
charged
as
the
complaint
states
with
four
violations
of
law
under
illinois
law.
two
statutes
and
two
ordinances,
they
were
charged
with
the
mob-action
statute,
the
resisting
arrest
statute,
the
disorderly
conduct
ordinance,
and
the
resisting
arrest
ordinance.
now,
on
the
14th
day
of
september
1967,
there
was
another
incident
where
there
was
a
mass
arrest
situation.
i
might
back
up
and
say
that
the
first
incident
was
locally
called
in
chicago
the
big
gym
incident
because
there,
a
negro
had
been
shot
by
a
white
man
and
people
had
gathered
to
peaceably
and
i
emphasize
this
to
peaceably
protest
against
this
unlawful
shooting
of
julius
woods,
a
negro
citizen.
now,
in
the
incident
that
occurred
on
september
14,
1967,
it
occurred
that
43rd
street
in
chicago,
43rd
in
langley
and
there
was
a
gathering
there
for
the
peaceful
and
lawful
demonstration
to
protest
against
the
unlawful
attack
and
brutal
beating
of
an
18-year-old
negro
woman
who
reside
in
the
community
by
police
officers.
the
other
incident
is
the
incident
of
may
21,
1967
and
there
was
a
gathering
at
51st
street
in
south
park
avenue
in
the
city
of
chicago
to
peaceably
protest
for
redress
of
grievances
and
that
they
wanted
to
rename
washington
park
to
a
name
that
they
felt
would
be
more
relevant
in
location
and
character
to
the
predominantly
number
of
negro
residents
who
resided
in
the
vicinity
of
that
park.
there
was
another
mass
arrest
in
that
situation.
on
august
23,
1967,
there
was
a
gathering
at
the
111th
street
in
the
city
of
chicago
to
protest
and
to
inquire
with
respect
to
the
unlawful
shooting
of
another
negro
youth
and
resident
of
that
community.
on
august
4,
1967,
there
was
a
gathering
peacefully
at
a
playground
to
protest
that
there
were
not
sufficient
playgrounds
located
in
certain
sections
of
the
city
of
chicago,
and
particularly
this
was
at
3501
south
wallace
street
in
chicago.
and
the
protest
was
against
the
lack
and
absence
of
adequate
playground
facilities
in
the
black
community.
now,
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
in
each
and
every
one
of
these
particular
arrests
that
took
place
in
the
summer
of
1967,
all
of
the
people
who
arrested
in
mass
the
following
things
happened.
they
were
all
charged
with
four
identical
charges:
mob
action,
state
resisting
arrest,
city
ordinance
resisting
arrest,
and
the
city
ordinance
of
disorderly
conduct.
in
each
and
every
instance,
the
people
had
bonds
placed
against
them
ranging
from
$10,000.00
up
to
and
including
$50,000.00
as
is
alleged
in
the
complaint.
now,
with
this
background,
we
then
go
into
our
allegations,
which
bring
us
to
the
intimidation
statute.
we
have
alleged
that
there
was,
and
i
will
point
out
the
points
and
parts
of
the
complaint
at
paragraph
21
of
the
complaint
we
alleged
the
following.
we
alleged
that
the
defendants,
this
being
the
mayor
of
chicago,
the
chief
judge
of
the
circuit
court
of
chicago,
the
sheriff,
the
ordinance
enforcement
person,
and
the
corporation
counsel's
office,
and
certain
magistrates
which
were
named
as
defendants
in
the
original
complaint.
we
alleged
that,
them
or
some
of
them
have
met
together
on
more
than
one
occasion,
they
have
discussed,
formulated,
outlined
and
agreed
to
a
detailed
plan
and
scheme
of
harassment,
arrest,
detention,
setting
of
exorbitant
and
excessive
bail,
prosecutions,
trials,
conviction
fines,
and
imprisonment
which
detail
plan
and
program
they
have
agreed
to
direct
against
plaintiffs
herein
and
other
citizens
of
the
united
states,
members
of
the
same
class
as
these
plaintiffs
similarly
situated
solely
for
the
purpose
of
deterring,
hindering,
preventing
and
depriving
these
plaintiffs
of
rights,
privileges
and
immunities
secured
to
them
by
the
constitutions
and
laws
of
united
states,
and
more
particularly
of
the
first
amendment
privileges
of
speech
and
assembly.
now
we
allege
in
subparagraph
(a)
under
21
that
the
defendant
james
conlisk
who
is
the
superintendent
police
and
richard
jay
l.
rod
who
was
in-charge
in
of
ordinance
enforcement
of
the
corporations
councils
office.
as
a
result
of
the
above
described
meetings
and
this
is
found
pages
9
and
10
of
the
record,
among
defendants
and
formulation
of
the
above
described
plan
and
scheme
have
been
designated
by
their
superiors
namely
defendants
richard
jay
daley
and
raymond
f.
simon
respectfully
to
be
principal
persons
to
implement
and
carry
out
the
aforesaid
plans
of
the
deterrence,
hindrance
and
prevention
of
the
exercise
of
plaintiffs
first
amendment
privileges
of
speech
and
assembly.
by
designating
the
occasions,
places
and
manner
of
arrest
as
well
as
the
number
of
plaintiffs
to
be
arrested
and
by
actual
designation
of
particular
places
of
detention
or
particular
plaintiffs
as
distinguished
from
other
persons
arrested
in
the
city
of
chicago.
then
in
the
subparagraph
(c)
of
that
same
paragraph
21
found
at
page
11,
defendants
richard
jay
l.
rod
and
the
defendant
john
j.
stamos
acting
through
his
subordinates
as
a
states
attorney
of
cook
county
have
threatened
and
actually
attempted
to
set
in
motion
unlawful
prosecutions
of
the
plaintiffs
or
some
of
them
through
the
application
of
these
--
to
these
plaintiffs
of
the
aforesaid
statutes
of
the
state
of
illinois
and
ordinances
of
the
city
of
chicago.
now,
then
we
go
ahead
and
say
at
paragraph
25
found
in
page
12,
pursuant
to
this
plan
or
scheme,
the
defendants
have
attempted
to
threaten
and
continue
to
attempt
to
prosecute
the
plaintiffs
and
all
persons
associated
with
them
or
working
in
cooperation
therewith
under
color
and
authority
of
certain
statutes
namely,
and
we
set
forth
chapter
38
section
25
(a)
(1)
and
(2),
chapter
38
section
31-1,
chapter
38
section
12-2,
12-4,
12-6
which
is
the
one
that
where
before,
your
honors
on
and
certain
ordinances
of
the
city
of
chicago
to
wit,
chapter
193-1
and
chapter
11-33
said
statutes
and
ordinances
are
set
forth
in
an
appendix
marked
exhibit
“a”
etcetera.
now,
then
your
honors
--
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
well,
your
honor
we
later
alleged
on
those
complaints
that
the
statutes
on
their
face
were
--
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
we
do.
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
but
i'm
only
--
mr.
ellis
e.
reid
i
beg
to
differ
with
you,
your
honor.
i
think
it
does
because
i
think
that
as
said
by
this
court
in
golden,
you
have
to
take
all
the
facts
and
circumstances
into
account.
this
is
a
unique
case,
this
case
may
never
happen
again
in
a
hundred
years.
but
what
i'm
saying
is
that
you
have
to
go
back
in
time
and
i
am
asking
your
honors
to
do
this
on
your
own
mind
sight
to
1967
in
the
summer
in
chicago
and
ask
yourself
what
was
happening
to
those
people
then?
why
was
this
issue
standing
apparently
overlooked
by
the
district
court?
why
were
there
no
requirement
of
proof
by
the
court?
and
the
answer
was
obvious.
the
court
well
knew
what
was
happening
in
chicago
and
the
court
well
knew
and
perhaps
the
states
attorney
then
conceded
the
point
that
he
did
not
want
us
to
bring
in
our
evidence
of
what
the
threat
was
and
now
they
get
up
here
and
get
a
clean
shot
by
saying
the
threat
is
now
a
conclusion
instead
of
a
statement
of
fact.
your
honor,
i
say
that
when
we
say
we
were
threatened,
i
say
that
is
an
allegation
of
fact
in
our
complaint.
it
is
not
a
conclusion
of
law
and
i
am
saying
you
look
at
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
to
back
up
at
the
total
four
corners
of
the
complaint
to
say,
does
this
complaint
state
a
cause
of
action
upon
which
relief
can
be
granted?
and
in
the
federal
system,
i
understand
we
are
not
obligated
to
plead
evidence
but
to
plead
in
simple
language
the
fact
that
there
is
a
case
or
controversy
upon
which
the
court
is
asked
to
render
a
ruling.
and
i
am
saying
that
when
we
stood
before
that
three-judge
court,
there
was
in
fact
a
sincere
and
obvious
case
in
controversy
involving
the
mob
action
statute,
involving
the
resisting
arrest
statute
and
involving
ordinances
of
the
city
of
chicago.
now,
to
give
up
on
your
appeal
on
those
matters
on
the
merits
and
then
to
appeal
on
one
issue
and
one
issue
alone
would
say,
“look,
aha,
nobody
was
ever
charged
with
intimidation.
therefore
they
have
no
standing.
what
i
am
saying
that
it
would
be,
really
an
abuse
of
the
court
to
go
back
and
then
say
“we'll
now
arrest
somebody
and
we'll
now
go
back
to
this
arduous
process
to
get
at
the
intimidation
statute
which
is
obviously
on
its
face
back.”
it
would
be
just
like
surgeon
going
to
a
man's
abdominal
cavity
and
seeing
a
bad
appendix
when
he
is
in
there
for
something
else
and
then
closing
up
the
man
and
then
going
back
next
week
and
then
opening
up
the
abdominal
cavity
to
take
out
the
bad
appendix.
and
that
may
even
amount
to
medical
malpractice
but
i
am
saying
it
is
a
similar
situation
here.
it's
a
question
of
pendent
jurisdiction.
the
court
had
before
it
an
issue
that
had
the
jurisdiction
of
not
only
the
parties
but
of
the
subject
matter
involving
clearly
the
mob-action
statute
and
clearly
the
other
matters
that
were
before
the
court.
now
what
makes
this
case
unique
is
that
the
court
then
in
the
fact
of
pendent
jurisdiction
dealt
with
obvious
issue
and
took
care
all
of
our
ills
at
one
time
which
i
suggest
to
the
court
is
the
better
way
to
do
it.
then
they
come
up
and
say,
aha,
we
walked
in,
off
of
the
street
and
we
only
attacked
section
12-6
and
nobody
ever
threatened
us.
nobody
was
ever
arrested.
there
were
no
high
bonds.
there
was
none
of
this
background
and
ask
you
to
try
this
case
in
the
vacuum
and
i
say
it
cannot
be
argued
in
the
vacuum,
it
cannot
be
tried
in
a
vacuum
but
you
must
understand
that
what
the
court
did
in
my
humble
opinion
was
the
only
thing
it
could
have
done,
other
than
to
put
us
to
additional
expense
and
put
the
court
to
additional
time
with
additional
burdens
upon
the
court
and
upon
this
court.
now,
i
--
that
is
really
the
gravamen
of
my
argument
is
that
case
is
unique
and
that
our
standing
to
sue
stands
on
the
issue
of
pendent
jurisdiction.
we
were
properly
in
court
and
the
court
took
care
of
all
our
ills
and
the
court
in
fact
saved
itself
some
time
because
now
i
come
to
the
argument
which
is
even
the
states
attorney
wants
me
to
reach
and
that
is
that
on
the
face
of
this
particular
statute,
there
is
a
question
of
whether
or
not
it
was
in
fact
overbroad
or
vague.
and
i
submit
to
your
honor
that
it
was
both
and
the
court
in
its
opinion
written
by
three
judges
came
to
the
conclusion
that
it
was
both
overbroad
and
vague.
now,
here
is
the
problem
with
that
intimidation
statute.
the
problem
is
this,
whenever
you
take
an
intimidation
statute
or
extortion
statute
or
what
have
you,
and
you
put
it
on
the
political
arena
as
they
have
done
here
and
the
victim
of
that
alleged
crime
becomes
the
politicians
either
on
the
state
of
local
level
or
a
national
level.
then
you
have
really
set
the
collision
in
motion
of
the
right
of
our
society
to
deal
with
freedom
of
speech
on
an
ordered
liberty
and
the
right
of
people
to
be
free
from
threats.
well,
i
say
your
honor
as
you've
said
in
cases
involving
libel
and
slander
in
dealing
with
people
who
are
public
figures.
once
you
enter
the
public
arena,
you're
not
to
be
cuddled
and
protected
because
you
are
a
public
institution
and
so
when
i
say
that
you
cannot
say
that
these
politicians
are
so
frail
that
we
can't
tell
them
directly
or
indirectly
that
unless
you
redress
our
grievances,
we
will
do
less
insult.
now
this
brings
us
to
the
ill
in
the
statute,
that
section
which
the
court
found
to
be
overbroad
says
that
we
will
commit
in
a
crime
and
this
sends
us
back
not
only
to
the
criminal
code.
it
sends
us
back
to
all
regulatory
legislations
which
has
a
sanction
of
criminal
punishment
therein.
it
sends
us
back
to
all
the
ordinances
of
the
city
of
chicago
which
may
or
may
not
be
codified
which
have
sanctions,
and
i
submit
to
you
that
there
is
no
way
with
regard
to
vagueness
that
you
can
then
determine
when
you've
committed
a
crime
and
the
sanction
in
this
particular
section
is
five
years
imprisonment.
now,
the
crime
that
you
may
threaten
to
commit
if
it
goes
to
(inaudible)
may
only
be
fine
of
$25.00
or
maybe
up
to
a
year
in
jail
then
to
convert
speech
into
felony.
i
mean
this
is
really
what
we
are
talking
about
here.
you
are
dealing
with
politicians
and
you
say
now
by
threatening
a
politician
that
i
will
commit
a
crime
that
has
a
$25.00
penalty
and
now
i
can
get
five
years.
well,
obviously
we
were
chilled
by
this
and
there
was
a
chilling
effect
of
the
threat
of
this
that
we
have
to
beat
them
to
the
courthouse.
now
whether
or
not
we
were
too
fast
and
got
to
the
courthouse
first,
i
don't
think
your
honors
have
to
reach
that
because
we
were
properly
in
court
on
the
mob-action
statute
and
on
all
the
other
statutes
that
the
court
dealt
with
and
i
felt
that
and
i
feel
now
that
the
court
had
a
right
and
a
duty.
not
only
a
right
but
a
duty
to
deal
on
the
basis
of
pendent
jurisdiction
with
this
other
matter
and
there
was
an
actual
case
and
controversy
based
on
our
allegations
of
meetings,
threats
and
plans
and
also
these
facts
are
somewhat
important.
the
uniformed
charges
of
all
these
people
and
all
this
incidents,
you
see
there
are
four
charges
on
all
these
incidents
that
went
before
and
it
just
doesn't
happen
that
way
generally
unless
there
is
some
concerted
action
that
everybody
would
be
--
who
is
involved
in
this
type
of
matter
violates
four
charges
each
and
every
time
and
everybody
although
he
may
be
a
college
student
with
no
prior
record
has
a
bond
of
$10,000.00
set
against
him
and
he
stays
in
jail
for
ten
days
before
he
can
get
bond
or
get
it
load
in
a
petition
and
therefore
loses
time
in
school.
so,
i
am
saying
that
there
was
an
actual
case
or
controversy.
there
were
litigants
who
clearly
represented
the
rights
of
all
the
people
that
we
sued
on
behalf
of
and
whether
or
not
no
one
was
arrested
because
of
one
statute
that
had
been
threatened
to
be
used
in
the
future.
you
see
we
then
get
on
the
horns
of
the
dilemma
--
of
the
dilemma
2283
anti-injunction
statute
which
says
now
if
they
beat
you
to
court,
you
cannot
get
an
injunction;
if
you
beat
them
to
court,
you
have
no
standing.
now,
i
submit
your
honors
that
this
is
a
precarious
and
it
is
a
wrongful
position
of
the
people
to
be
put
in
because
as
advocates
of
really
the
first
amendment
freedom,
which
is
the
touchstone
of
our
very
democracy.
if
we
are
going
to
deny
by
this
dilemma,
the
court
system
and
the
judicious
use
of
the
court
system
because
i
recognize
also
that
we
cannot
inundate
this
court
with
this
types
of
cases
because
then
this
court
will
have
to
seize
to
function
because
it
will
be
shuffling
papers.
but
i
submit
that
is
an
apparent
but
unreal
fear
because
first
of
all
you
have
to
run
this
gauntlet.
you
have
to
go
through
a
three-judge
court
which
must
be
convened
by
a
single
judge
who
must
see
some
merit,
apparent
merit
in
your
complaint
before
he
will
even
convene
a
three-judge
court.
one
of
the
judges
sitting
on
that
three-judge
court
is
a
member
of
the
court
of
appeals.
now,
these
judges
or
at
least
the
majority
of
these
three
judges
must
then
rule
on
the
matter
before
the
matter
will
get
here
as
a
matter
of
right.
now
if
the
matter
is
frivolous
and
no
three-judge
court
is
convened
then
we
don't
have
a
matter
of
right
appeal
here.
we
would
then
have
to
go
to
the
court
of
appeals
if
it
was
not
frivolous
and
the
three-judge
court
decided
the
issue.
then
i
submit,
your
honor
that
you've
done
a
screening
device.
you've
got
a
three-judge
court
here
which
is
convened
and
then
the
matter
is
not
frivolous
and
then
your
honors
have
the
duty
to
hear
it
because
that
caveat
of
first
amendment
freedoms
that
we're
dealing
with.
i
cannot
emphasize
how
important
it
is
because
if
we
cut
off
that
valve
and
say
that
you
cannot
get
to
this
court
in
matters
of
freedom
of
speech,
redress
of
grievances,
peaceful
assembly.
and
i
am
not
talking
about
anarchy
and
i
am
not
talking
about
violence
or
anything
like
that.
i
am
talking
about
the
legitimate,
peaceful
first
amendment
rights
that
we
all
suggest
or
should
be
nurtured.
then
everybody
will
then
say,
“well,
if
i
cannot
use
the
courts,
what
is
my
next
remedy?”
and
the
next
remedy
may
well
be
that
we
then
all
have
to
become
revolutionaries
as
they
did
in
1776
and
overthrow
the
entire
government
because
the
courts
if
they
don't
give
you
a
remedy,
a
speedy
remedy,
an
open
remedy,
one
that
you
can
count
and
rely
on
as
advocates
and
lawyers,
then
i
suggest
you
what
do
you
tell
your
clients
when
they
say,
“the
doors
have
been
closed,
so
let's
take
to
the
streets”
and
as
with
that
in
mind
that
i
say
to
you,
you
have
a
duty
dombrowski.
i
must
say
when
i
read
the
opinion,
i
have
felt
that
it
was
a
long
time
coming
but
i
am
saying
you
have
no
right
in
light
of
what's
happening
today
to
turn
back
the
clock
with
respect
to
dombrowski.
you
have
the
duty
to
open
that
wire.
thank
you
very
much.
