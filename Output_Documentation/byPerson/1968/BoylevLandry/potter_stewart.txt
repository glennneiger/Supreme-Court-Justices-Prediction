how
did
this
list
on
page
25
get
in
this
appendix,
there
are
some
(voice
overlap)?
justice
potter
stewart
if
the
claim
where
--
if
the
statement
where
if
"you
don't
hire
a
negroes
we'll
murder
you?"
that
would
clearly
be
under
the
statute
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
threat
to
commit
a
crime.
if
you
don't
hire
negroes
we'll
burglarize
your
store.
it
would
also
come
under.
justice
potter
stewart
but
if
it's
simply
if
you
don't
hire
a
negro
we'll
see
to
it
that
you
don't
make
a
profit
out
of
your
store
that
would
not
come
under
this
stage.
justice
potter
stewart
because
that
would
implicitly
be
a
threat
of
no
more
than
not
to
patronize
the
store.
i
suppose
in
the
reason
when
infringe
could
be
drown,
would
that
be
right?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
issuance
of
an
injunction
is
what
gives
this
court
appellate
jurisdiction
under
section
1253.
justice
potter
stewart
and
now,
having
jurisdiction
of
the
case
it
would
be
nothing
in
the
way
of
the
court
holding
and
it
was
improper
for
the
district
court
not
only
to
grant
the
injunction
but
also
to
issue
a
declaratory
judgment
under
these
circumstances
and
that's
not
here,
the
whole
case
is
here.
justice
potter
stewart
i
suppose
if
you
are
correct
in
what
you
call
the
procedural
question
that
is
the
threshold
question
of
the
propriety
of
the
district
courts
acting
as
it
did.
it
would
follow
i
should
think
perhaps
wouldn't
it
that
this
court
would
vacate
the
district
court's
order
that
would
vacate
the
opinion
wouldn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
then
that
opinion
would
no
longer
be
in
the
books
because
you're
not
going
to
tear
it
out
of
the
federal
supplement
but
it
would
--
anybody
who
jeopardized
it
would
see
that
it
had
been
vacated.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
your
threshold
point.
justice
potter
stewart
withstand?
but
my
point
is
that
it
wouldn't
stand.
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
judgment
would
be
vacated
if
you're
correct
in
your
threshold
point.
justice
potter
stewart
you
don't
have
any
2283
argument
in
your
case,
do
you?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
the
--
what
were
the
terms
of
the
injunctions?
just
enjoined
any
enforcement
of
this
section
of
the
statute
in
the
future?
is
that
it
by
the
defendant?
justice
potter
stewart
last
page?
justice
potter
stewart
they
dropped
out
of
the
case?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
that
appears
on
page
3
of
your
opening
brief.
justice
potter
stewart
i
understand.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
reid,
except
for
your
conclusory
statement
on
the
top
of
page
11
and
perhaps
elsewhere
in
your
complaint
that
these
statutes
are
unconstitutional.
the
gravament
of
your
--
of
what
you've
been
reading
to
us
is
a
conspiracy
on
the
part
of
this
people
to
harass
your
clients
in
chicago
and
others
similarly
situated
by
abusing
criminal
statutes.
and
that
could
have
been
true
as
--
just
as
true
as
this
have
been
shoplifting
statutes
or
grand
larceny
statutes
or
anything
else.
if
they're
going
to
make
false
charges
against
you
and
conspire
to
misuse
statutes,
it
doesn't
necessarily,
it
doesn't
follow
at
all
the
statutes
themselves
are
unconstitutional,
does
it?
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
--
you
do
allege
that?
justice
potter
stewart
but
all
these
wrongs
that
you've
been
talking
about
could
equally
have
been
--
have
taken
place
with
respect
to
abusing
perfectly
valid,
concededly
valid
statutes
such
as
grand
larceny?
justice
potter
stewart
isn't
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
but
these
wrongs
don't
have
anything
to
do
necessarily
with
the
constitutionality
of
the
statutes
that
you
alleged
in
this
complaint
that
this
defendants
were
intending
to
abuse
in
order
to
harass
your
clients?
