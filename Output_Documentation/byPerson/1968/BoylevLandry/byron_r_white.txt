justice

white
what
are
the
--
were
any
of
those
suits
under
the
intimidation
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
but
they
don't
allege
any
state
officer
actually
threaten
them
with
prosecution
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
to
the
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
alleged
that
they
feel
threatened?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
say
they
are
deterred
from
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
advice
in
their
(voice
overlap).
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
is
that
conclusory?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
can
you
say
there
are
some
demonstrations
that
i
would
engaged
in
except
for
this
statutes,
is
that
(voice
overlap)
for
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
that's
not
my
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
say
there
are
some
demonstrations
that
we
would
engage
in
except
for
the
statute,
is
that
too
general
an
allegation
satisfied?
justice
byron
r.
white
can
you
say
on
there
was
a
demonstration
on
such
and
such
a
date
that
i
did
engage
in?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
it
has
to
be
specific
action
by
the
state
under
the
statutes?
justice
byron
r.
white
some
allegation?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
do
have
some
independent
criminal
statutes
that
--
against
extortion?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
this
is
the
only
threat?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
did
this
case
come
up
on
a
motion
to
dismiss?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
was
–-
they're
after
an
answer?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
denied
--
that
denied
motion
to
dismiss?
justice
byron
r.
white
there's
never
been
any
facts.
justice
byron
r.
white
never
been
any
facts
in
this
case
at
anyway?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
i
take
it
that
the
state
is
saying
that
your
allegation
in
section
--
in
paragraph
34
which
is
an
expressed
allegation
that
the
defendants
have
threatened
the
plaintiffs,
was
not
a
sufficient
allegation
to
sustain
--
to
survive
a
motion
to
dismiss?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
whatever
the
actual
facts
were
is
another
matter,
the
question
is
sufficiency
of
this
allegation?
justice
byron
r.
white
when
you
--
the
question
is
whether
you
must
not
only
say
you've
been
threatened
but
then
go
on
and
allege
specifically
how
you
been
threatened
on
a
certain
day
or
by
a
certain
letter
or
by
words
or
telephone
call
or
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
don't
waive
that's
the
jurisdictional
matter,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
the
state
ever
move
to
dismiss
or
one
of
jurisdiction
or
did
they
just
move
to
failure
to
state
of
claim?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
they
thereby
admitted
rule
---
their
allegations
of
34,
did
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
must
have
admitted
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
what
to
dismiss
before
judge
will
as
dissenting
judge.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
was
just
a
motion
to
dismiss
and
prepare
the
state
of
cause
of
action?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
for
that
--
for
those
purposes
they
admitted
your
allegations?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
they
never
move
to
dismiss
for
one
of
jurisdiction?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
then
after
the
three-judge
court
was
convened
they
didn't
file
their
answer
denying
34?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
but
at
least
you
never
did
address
himself
specifically
to
the
elements
of
either
injunction
of
declaratory
judgment
with
respect
to
the
intimidation
or
to
the
threat
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
don't
see
him
even
mentioned
declaratory.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
either
declaratory
general
injunction
was
not
in
either
aspect
you
didn't
talk
about
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
the
34
says
more
than
that?
34
says
defendants
have
threatened.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
that
on
a
motion
to
dismiss
for
failure
to
state
--
an
equitable
claim
that
you
could
say
that
you
have
threatened
these
people?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
wouldn't
admitted
by
that
motion
to
threat
anybody?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
--
justice
byron
r.
white
this
says
defendants
have
threatened
and
continued
to
threaten.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
just
a
general
description
of
facts
isn't
a
conclusion.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
what
do
you
think
a
conclusion
is?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
have
any
cases
indicating
this
kind
of
a
--
allegation
as
insufficient?
justice
byron
r.
white
anywhere?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
are
the
evidences
in
the
record
that
you're
arguing
now?
where
is
the
evidence
as
--
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
mean,
mr.
elrod
is
present
in
all
of
these
proceedings?
justice
byron

white
yes,
i
know.
justice
byron

white
is
that
in
the
record?
justice
byron

white
how
do
you
know
if
mr.
eldrod,
doing
thing
we
have
that
is
for
us,
i
think
we
was
ever
planning
to
use
this

against
that
(voice

justice
byron

white
what
are
the
--
were
any
of
those
suits
under
the
intimidation
statute?
justice
byron

no,
but
they
don't
allege
any
state
officer
actually
threaten
them
with
prosecution
--
justice
byron

white
--
to
the
statute?
justice
byron

white
they
alleged
that
they
feel

and
