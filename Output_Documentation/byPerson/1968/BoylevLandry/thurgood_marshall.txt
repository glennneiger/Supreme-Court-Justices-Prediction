marshall
mr.
reid,
what
experience
did
any
of
these
people
have
with
the
statute
that
was
held
unconstitutional
in
this
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
experience
did
any
of
your
people
had
with
the
enforcement
of
this
statute
which
was
declared
unconstitutional
in
this
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
an
indirect
threat?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
sufficient
to
declare
a
statute
unconstitutional?
justice
thurgood
marshall
could
you
be
chilled
by
rumor?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
weren't
you
chilled
when
the
statute
was
passed?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
just
found
it,
didn't
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
just
found
the
statute?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
just
found
the
statute
before
this
was
filed?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes,
sir.
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes,
sir.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
to
do
we
do
with
the
states
specific
denial
of
34?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
did
they
do
with
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
you
say
--
you
say
you
were
threatened
and
the
states
say
you
were
not
threatened?
justice
thurgood
marshall
now,
on
basis
of
that
that's
all
the
court
had
to
go?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
about
a
civil
court
action
in
which
the
allegation
is
made
that
the
six
defendants
threatened
to
be
with
vital
harm,
do
you
think
they
would
stand
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
like
what?
justice
thurgood
marshall
which
is
evidence?
justice
thurgood
marshall
which
you
don't
use
to
plea.
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
do
you
run
off
the
point
that
you
filed
an
answer
and
denied
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
bilton,
suppose
a
man
walks
into
a
stores
and
says,
"if
you
don't
hire
negroes,
i
will
see
to
it
that
you
get
no
more
profits."
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
if
he
walks
in
his
dog
and
says,
"either
you
give
me
some
money
or
i'm
going
to
shoot
you,"
that
takes
his
profit.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it's
positive.
they
say
that
we
will
make
sure
that
you
don't
make
a
nickel.
would
that
be
covered
by
the
statute?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
doesn't
say
any,
he
says
that
"either
you
hire
negroes
or
you
will
make
any
money."
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
don't
know
what
the
crime
in
illinois
(inaudible)
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
totality
do
we
have?
as
i
see
it,
we
have
several
allegations
that
people
had
been
threatened.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
i
could
read
those
in
the
text
of
the
whole
complaint
that
they
are
threatened
merely
by
the
presence
of
the
statute.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
other
way
could
i
read
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
without
some
--
there's
no
specificity
here
at
all.
justice
thurgood
marshall
there
are
no
facts
in
this
record
at
all
that
anybody
has
been
told
that
if
you
exercise
your
right
of
free
speech,
you
will
be
charged
with
this
crime.
there
is
not
one
word
in
the
record.
justice
thurgood
marshall
sure.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
i
mean,
suppose
a
man
in
the
sanitation
department
picking
up
garbage
says,
"if
you
don't
give
me
cleaner
garbage,
i'm
going
to
have
you
convicted
under
the
statute,
would
you
consider
that
as
a
threat."
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
my
personal
problem
mr.
reid
is
i
have
big
difficulty
in
going
outside
of
the
record.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
don't
agree
--
i
don't
agree
that
this
suggests
a
question
of
standing,
it
seems
like
a
question
of
whether
you
got
a
case
of
controversy?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
not
a
problem.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
about
your
fifth
class
which
is
a
class
of
all
these
people
that
they
haven't
participated
in
anything
yet?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
then
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
assume
that
anybody
in
chicago
could've
filed
this
suit?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
what
difference
is
this
group
you
mentioned?
justice
thurgood

mr.
