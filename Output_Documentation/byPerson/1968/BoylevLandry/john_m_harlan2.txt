could
i
ask
you
a
question
going
back
to
your
standing
point?
justice
john
m.
harlan
your
statement
that
find
on
its
face
fails
to
say
any
charge
formal
or
informal
of
a
particular
statute
the
district
court
held
the
constitution
in
the
particular
section,
is
that
challenged
by
your
opponent?
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
understand
that
but
i
understood
your
statement
was
that
as
to
the
group
of
that
that
you
were
charged
formally
charged
or
something
this
particular
statute
district
court
relied
on
the
intimidation
statute
was
not
involved
and
you're
charged?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
understood
you
to
say
that
the
defendants
who
were
not
properly
charged.
there
is
no
allegation
in
the
complaint
that
they
were
threatened.
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
my
recollection,
the
complaint
is
perhaps
i'm
wrong
is
that
in
one
general
allegation
beginning
they
list
this
intimidation
statute
among
the
others
when
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
they
come
down
to
say
what
specific
defendants
are
complaining
about
this
intimidation
statute
is
not
the
first.

do
you
think
the

chill
the

courts?
justice
john
m.
harlan
there
is
one
thing
you're
off
the
record
discussion
with
this
and
you
need
to
be
pertinent,
you
said
this
statute
had
been
repealed
by
the
legislature
and
you
didn't
know
whether
it
had
been
signed
and
if
it
had
been
signed
this
will
moot
the
case
