justice
abe
fortas
is
this
the
only
statute
in
the
state
of
illinois
that
covers
some
intimidation,
commercial
intimidation
for
example
that
suppose
hey,
a
gangster
goes
to
a
store,
the
owner
of
a
store
and
says
unless
you
pay
me
hundred
dollars
a
week
we'll
burn
your
store?
justice
abe
fortas
how
do
you
construe
the
effect
of
the
court's
judgment
here?
the
court
says,
as
i
understand
it,
that
this
statute
is
hereby
declared
unconstitutional,
null
and
void
and
then
it
violates
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
constitution,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
now
does
that,
as
you
understand
it
would
that
mean
the
court's
judgment
here
mean
that
the
statutes
unavailable
to
the
state
and
situation
that
i
have
discussed?
justice
abe
fortas
sub-section
(a)
(3)?
justice
abe
fortas
and
that
this
is
not
equivalent
to
a
holding
confined
of
the
first
amendment
area.
justice
abe
fortas
because
there's
nothing
to
do
with
any
--
with
the
application
of
the
statute.
justice
abe
fortas
don't
you
have
to
have
another
element
under
this
statute
which
is
take
your
example
in
mayor
daley
unless
you
fire
the
superintendent
of
schools
we're
going
to
commit
this
misdemeanor
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
around
your
house?
justice
abe
fortas
but
in
that
element
of
the
threat
is
not
part
and
lets
say
part
of
the
suppose
misdemeanor.
justice
abe
fortas
has
there
been
to
get
around
of
the
first
question
which
i
assume
you're
going
to
make?
has
there
been
any
threat
of
invoking
this
statute
against
any
of
the
plaintiffs
here?
justice
abe
fortas
(voice
overlap)
of
the
appellees
here?
justice
abe
fortas
but
nobody
then
used
the
intimidation
statute.
justice
abe
fortas
did
you
specifically
allege
a
threat
to
prosecute
under
this
statute?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
missed
that
if
you
did
and
i
haven't
seen
that
and
i'd
like
to
be
directed
to
it
if
there
is
such
an
allegation.
justice
abe
fortas
now
you
challenged
quite
a
lot
of
statutes
didn't
you
in
your
initial
complaint?
did
you
challenge
all
of
those
statutes
that
listed
beginning
on
page
25
of
the
transcript
in
record
of
the
appendix?
page
25.
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
did
you
challenge
all
those?
justice
abe
fortas
but
that
attached
to
your
complaint,
wouldn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
as
part
of
exhibit
(a)
as
i
see
it
to
your
complain
here
in
statutes
and
ordinance
--
justice
abe
fortas
(voice
overlap)
do
you
contend
that
you
really
are
in
danger
of
being
arrested
for
advertising
psychic
or
magical
powers
or
for
promotion
of
marriage
or
spiritualism
and
fortune
telling,
do
you?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
the
real
problem
it's
not
merely
matter
amuses
me
but
it
sort
of
highlights
the
real
what
is
a
real
problem
in
this
case
to
me
which
is
whether
you
can
go
through
a
statute
book
and
without
any
specific
or
explicit
basis
and
threats
of
enforcement
you
say
against
you
whether
you
can
just
go
through
a
statute
book
and
pick
out
statutes
that
might
conceivably
be
used
by
the
police
and
a
civil
rights
demonstration
and
then
bring
an
action
based
on
dombrowski
seeking
relief
or
whether
you've
got
to
have
a
specific
basis
and
specific
threats,
specific
harassment,
specific
action
taken
under
a
specific
statute
before
you
can
utilize
dombrowski.
that's
the
issue
here
and
this
long
list
is
merely
a
humorous
illustration
of
a
kind
of
intellectual
problem
and
legal
problem
that
i
suspect
is
very
real
in
this
case.
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
but
the
question
perhaps
is
whether
you
have
this
by
general
allegation
listing
some
general
statutes
and
then
inserting
a
general
allegation
that
you're
threatened
with
harassment
under
those
statutes,
that's
your
paragraph
34.
justice
abe
fortas
whether
you
made
out
a
basis
saying
whether
you
made
out
--
whether
you
got
a
complaint
that
really
comes
under
dombrowski.
and
on
dombrowski
is
quite
a
different
kind
of
case
when
it's
at
least
arguable
that
dombrowski
is
quite
a
different
kind
of
case
then
you've
been
presenting
to
us
with
respect
to
the
intimidation
statute
because
all
you
have
alleged
here
is
very
general
statement
embracing
a
number
of
statutes
without
any
particularization
and
embracing
and
alleging
a
general
danger
of
prosecution
again
so
far
as
this
statute
is
concerned
without
any
particularization.
justice
