mr.
thomas
e.
brannigan
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
thomas
brannigan.
i'm
the
assistant
states
attorney
of
cook
county,
illinois
and
i
represent
the
appellants
in
this
case.
i
am
the
third
assistant
states
attorney
from
cook
county
to
argue
this
case
in
court
and
i
want
to
say
that
i
hope
that
i
can
bring
new
insights
to
this
appeal,
but
if
i
can't
i
want
to
make
--
let
you
know
that
we
have
accomplished
one
thing
anyway
and
that
is
that
we
have
brought
new
faces
before
the
court
and
i
am
at
least
please
in
that.
mr.
thomas
e.
brannigan
on
the
brief,
yes.
the
statute
that
we're
here
concerned
about
is
the
illinois
intimidation
statute,
and
not
the
entire
statute
but
only
a
subsection
of
the
statute
which
was
held
unconstitutional
by
a
three-judge
court
and
an
injunction
was
issued
in
joining
states
attorney
from
prosecuting
anybody
under
this
statute.
the
statute
provides,
“a
person
commits
intimidation
when,
with
intent
to
cause
another
to
perform
or
to
omit
the
performance
of
any
act,
he
communicates
to
another
a
threat
to
perform
without
lawful
authority
any
of
the
following
acts”.
now
all
the
other
subsections
were
held
constitutional,
but
this
one
subsection,
“commit
any
criminal
offense”
was
held
unconstitutional.
the
reasoning
of
the
court
was
that
this
language
“commit
any
criminal
offense”
would
include
misdemeanors
or
insubstantial
offenses,
and
mere
violations
of
--
against
public
order
statute
only
and
that
it
was
there
for
overbroad
and
unconstitutional.
now
before
i
turn
to
the
question
of
the
finding
of
unconstitutionality
we
have,
as
we
have
in
all
the
cases
that
were
set
down
with
this
case
the
procedural
question.
and
that
is
the
problem
raised
by
the
--
what
is
now
generally
called
the
dombrowski-type
complaint.
and
this
is
the
type
of
complaint
that
was
filed
in
the
district
court
below.
but
we
submit
that
this
is
not
a
dombrowski-type
complaint.
it's
not
as
zwickler
because
in
those
cases
there
was
allegations
and
showing
of
some
prior
activity
by
the
state
officials
under
the
statute
which
the
court
found
unconstitutional.
in
this
case,
nobody,
none
of
the
plaintiffs
were
charged
with
the
violation
of
this
intimidation
statute,
not
any
section
of
it
and
not
this
subsection.
there
was
no
--
the
allegation
that
the
district
court
felt
was
sufficient
to
bring
this
--
the
merits
of
this
statute
to
its
attention
was
the
allegation
that
the
--
that
there
was
a
threat
to
enforce
the
statute
and
that
the
purpose
of
the
threat
and
enforcement
was
to
harass
and
intimidate
the
plaintiffs
who
were
simply
exercising
first
amendment
rights
and
demonstrating,
advocating
for
equality
--
racial
equality
in
chicago.
but
we
submit
that
there
is
a
big
difference
in
this
case
and
in
the
dombrowski
and
zwickler
because
there
was
this
course
of
conduct
that
those
plaintiffs
could
point
to
and
say,
“this
is
how
we're
being
harassed.
this
is
what
the
state
officials
are
doing.”
now,
for
example
one
of
the
subsections
to
which
was
held
constitutional
says
that
one
of
the
threats
made
to
a
person
which
would
constitute
intimidation
would
be
to
take
action
as
a
public
official
against
anyone
or
anything
or
withhold
official
action
or
cause
such
action
or
withholding,
and
yet
none
of
the
plaintiffs
were
public
officials.
none
of
them
were
capable
of
acting
as
public
officials
so
that
they
could
take
action
as
a
public
official
against
anyone
or
anything.
and
yet
the
court
felt
under
dombrowski
that
they
could
reach
all
the
subsections
and
decide
one
after
another
whether
or
not
they
were
constitutional
or
not.
now,
we
of
course
realized
that
if
this
court
were
to
decide
that
the
district
court
should
not
have
reached
this
question
and
there
would
be
a
reversal
on
grounds
other
than
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
below
would
stand
in
effect
in
illinois
as
the
only
decision
interpreting
this
subsection
of
the
illinois
intimidation
statute
and
that
decision
would
be
that
it
was
unconstitutional.
so
we
would
ask
the
court
to,
in
this
case
it
is
our
request
that
if
it
be
possible
that
the
court
also
reach
the
question
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute.
mr.
thomas
e.
brannigan
yes
it
would
and
--
mr.
thomas
e.
brannigan
that's
true
you're
correct,
but
--
mr.
thomas
e.
brannigan
that's
true,
your
honor
but,
nevertheless
that
determination
withstand.
we
would
live
for
--
mr.
thomas
e.
brannigan
well
i
mean
it
would
be,
it
would
be
a
reversal
on
some
other
ground
your
honor
as
--
mr.
thomas
e.
brannigan
now,
what
we
feel
so
strongly
about
the
question
of
the
constitutionality
of
this
statute,
your
honor
that
--
and
we
feel
that
the
district
court
was
wrong
in
finding
the
statute
unconstitutional.
and
i
would
like
to
just
address
myself
immediately
to
that
to
show
you
why
we
feel
so
strongly
about
it.
the
--
i
think
that
the
first
point
that
must
be
made
about
this
statute
is
that
it
is
not
a
public
order
statue.
it's
not
designed
to
maintain
public
order.
it's
not
designed
as
a
protection
of
the
state
of
the
sovereignty,
but
it
is
designed
to
protect
an
individual
from
threats.
and
the
district
court
in
its
opinion
said
that,
“the
term
threat
has
a
sinister
and
well
define
meaning
in
common
parlance
and
in
the
law.”
it
is
the
expression
of
intention
to
inflict
evil
or
injury
on
another.
it
is
more
than
a
mere
expression
of
such
an
intent.
it
is
a
menace,
especially
any
menace
of
such
a
nature
and
extent
as
to
unsettle
the
mind
of
the
person
on
whom
it
operates.
and
to
take
away
from
his
acts
that
free
and
voluntary
action
which
alone
constitutes
consent,
that's
the
kind
of
threat
the
district
court
held
is
what
is
prohibited
by
the
statute.
now
the
court
said
that
that
subsection
(a)
and
all
the
other
subsections
were
not
vague,
they
could
be
understood,
but
they
were
overbroad
and
they
pointed
out
some
examples.
they
said
that
this
statute
would
in
effect
make
legal
threats
by
mothers
to
block
traffic
to
cause
stop
sign
to
be
placed
at
an
intersection
because
it
was
a
dangerous
intersection.
that
it
would
prohibit
threats
by
persons
who
lived
in
a
dangerous
neighborhood
who
threaten
to
carry
arms
because
of
the
dangerous
neighborhood
they
lived
in.
i
think
that
what
the
court
there
does
in
that
language
is
that
it
turns
the
focus
from
this
threat
to
the
person
to
just
advocacy
of
threatening
in
the
abstract.
and
this
statute
does
not
prohibit
people
from
standing
up
in
the
civic
center
in
downtown
chicago
and
saying,
“we
are
going
to
carry
arms
in
our
neighborhood
because
we
live
in
a
bad
neighborhood.”
in
other
words,
we're
going
to
commit
a
crime
because
we
live
in
a
bad
neighborhood.
this
statute
has
nothing
to
do
with
that
type
of
language,
that
type
of
advocacy.
to
the
same
extent
the
mothers
who
want
to
block
traffic,
they
can
talk
about
it
all
they
want.
they
can
advocate
it
and
this
statute
does
not
prohibit
that
type
of
talking
in
speech.
what
it
prohibits
is
threats
directed
towards
somebody
to
deprive
that
person
of
his
free
will
and
it's
got
to
be
that
type
of
sinister
threat
that
freezes
his
free
will
and
makes
him
act
in
a
way
that
he
doesn't
want
to
act.
and
i
think
that
the
proof
that
the
court
misapplied
the
first
amendment
doctrine
enunciated
by
this
court
in
striking
this
statute
down
is
the
statement
in
the
brief
that
--
a
statement
in
the
lower
court
opinion
that
what
the
public
official
--
what
the
state
of
illinois
can
do
is
wait
till
this
threatened
act,
this
minor,
little,
insignificant
violation
of
a
public
order
statute
is
carried
out
and
then
go
ahead
and
prosecute
people
for
violating
that
law.
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
is
that
if
the
threat
to
the
individual
is
successful
that
is,
“you
do
something
or
we
will
carry
you
in
bare
arms.”
then
if
the
threat
is
successful
and
the
person
making
the
threat
has
got
his
point
home
and
has
caused
that
individual
to
act
the
way
he
wants
them
to
act
he
will
not
carry
out
the
threat.
and
so
we
never
--
the
situation
doesn't
arise
where
the
violation,
the
threatened
act
is
ever
carried
out.
so
we
think
that
this
demonstrates
clearly
that
the
district
court
misapply
the
doctrines
enunciated
by
this
court
in
the
first
amendment
and
incorrectly
came
to
the
conclusion
that
this
statute
was
unconstitutional.
now,
we
point
out
in
our
briefs
that
there
are
other
statutes
that
are
wider
drawn
the
federal
hobbs
act
for
example
prohibits
one
from
interfering
with
commerce
by
extortion.
and
this
court
has
upheld
that
statute
where
there
were
threats
simply
to
violate
or
to
breach
a
contract
or
to
cause
a
strike
which
are
certainly
are
broader
than
what
this
statute
prohibits
and
that
is
the
commission
of
a
crime.
i
would
also
maybe
argue
that
this
subsection
is
really
surplusage
because
there
are
other
acts,
other
types
of
threats
that
are
enumerated
in
the
other
subsections
and
that
this
one
really
doesn't
--
we
don't
really
need
this
subsection.
we
think
that
it
was
a
legitimate
exercise
of
the
legislature's
judgment
to
include
the
subsection
so
that
types
of
threats
that
the
legislature
could
not
foresee
which
an
inventive
person
may
devise
to
use
to
intimidate
a
person
are
also
prohibited.
and
that
is
we
think
sufficient
reason
to
defer
to
the
legislative
judgment
here
and
to
approve
the
statute
on
constitutional
grounds.
getting
back
to
the
--
getting
back
to
the
procedural
question
i
must
re-stress
that
our
point
there
is
that
if
this
court
is
presently
considering
a
restatement
of
dombrowski
case
or
doctrines
that
have
emanated
from
it
the
course
of
the
cases
that
have
followed
the
dombrowski
case.
we
think
that
this
case
without
getting
into
a
whole
restatement
of
that
whole
question
can
simply
be
distinguished
by
dombrowski
and
zwickler
on
the
grounds
that
no
one
was
charged
with
intimidation.
there
was
just
a
bare
allegation
in
the
complaint
that
the
threat
was
made
to
use
the
statute
and
that
there
was
no
course
of
conduct
to
which
the
plaintiffs
could
point
to
which
was
anywhere
near
like
what
was
present
in
dombrowski
and
zwickler.
and
which
this
court
well
done
extensively
in
both
of
those
opinions
by
way
of
reaching
the
conclusion
that
the
federal
district
court
had
an
obligation
to
make
a
determination
of
the
constitutionality
of
statutes.
mr.
thomas
e.
brannigan
no
we
don't
because
we
don't
have
any
prosecutions.
mr.
thomas
e.
brannigan
yes,
your
honor
it's
on
the
last
page
of
the
appendix,
page
104.
mr.
thomas
e.
brannigan
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
e.
brannigan
104,
the
last
page
in
the
appendix.
“hereby
ordered
and
adjudged,
and
decreed
that
the
defendants,
their
employees,
servants,
and
agents
be,
and
they
hereby
perpetually
enjoined
and
restrained
from
the
enforcement
of,
or
the
prosecution
under
these
other
statutes,”
your
honor
that
are
mentioned.
there
are
other
statutes,
which
were
held
unconstitutional.
mr.
thomas
e.
brannigan
we
have
not
appealed
from
it.
the
only
section
that
we
appeal
from
is
the
illinois
intimidation
statutes,
which
is
chapter
38
section
12-6
(a)
(3).
mr.
thomas
e.
brannigan
that's
right
your
honor,
and
it's
only
that
little
subsection
that
we're
taking
about.
mr.
thomas
e.
brannigan
thank
you,
your
honor.
when
it
has
been
suggested
that
the
question
of
the
standing
of
the
plaintiffs
to
raise
this
constitutional
objection
to
the
illinois
intimidation
statute,
this
subsection
ought
to
be
sustained
on
pendent
jurisdiction
and
i
think
that
i
disagree
with
that
and
i
do
not
think
it's
called
for.
first
of
all
dombrowski
and
zwickler
were
the
court
said,
extra
ordinary
cases.
nobody
here
has
been
charged
with
the
violation
of
this
intimidation
statute.
nobody
has
been
charged
with
the
violation
of
this
subsection.
i
think
to
take
an
extraordinary
step
like
was
taken
in
dombrowski,
that
alone
i
think
is
the
court
recognized
in
the
opinion,
it
was
taking
a
significant
new
step.
to
now
say
we
can
drag
in
all
sorts
of
challenges
to
state
statutes
on
the
concept
of
pendent
jurisdiction
i
just
think
it's
uncalled
for.
i
think
that
this
would
create
a
monster
that
the
court
will
never
be
able
to
control
if
it
incorporates
the
challenges
to
statute
whether
they
are
being
used
or
not
or
ever
has
been
used
against
the
plaintiffs
in
a
complaint
drawn
like
the
complaint
in
the
lower
court
and
say
we
want
an
adjudication
of
all
these
statutes
whether
or
not
they
are
constitutional
or
not.
i
think
that's
the
step
that
this
court
shouldn't
take.
now,
so
far
as
what
was
going
on
chicago
on
1976,
mr.
reid
has
been
talking
a
lot
of
things
here
that
i
don't
know
if
they
occurred
or
not
but
they
put
us
in
a
bad
light.
the
fact
remains
however
that
i
think
that
one
thing
--
the
fact
--
one
fact,
that
court
can
take
notice
of
is
an
appeal.
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
which
was
decided
on
february
5,
1970
and
cause
number
17346
entitled
boyle
versus
landry.
this
was
another
aspect
of
this
case
where
the
court
decided
that
certain
sections
challenged
in
this
action
were
constitutional.
it
remanded
the
case
to
the
single-judge
court
and
said,
“now,
you
determine
whether
or
not
they
are
being
applied
unconstitutionally.”
and
there
were
hearings
held
and
witnesses
were
brought
in.
these
people
who
have
been
arrested
said
we
were
peacefully
demonstrating.
we
weren't
doing
anything
and
the
police
came
along
and
charged
us
with
violations
of
all
these
statutes
which
the
three-judge
court
had
just
held
were
constitutional
statute
and
we
were
not
doing
anything
except
exercising
first
amendment
rights
and
here
we
are
being
charged
with
this
things.
and
the
single
judge
said
that
shows
they
are
being
tried,
you
do
not
have
evidence
here
to
--
we
didn't
offer
any
evidence
whatsoever.
we
said
to
the
courts
should
submit
to
the
bar
of
2283.
the
court
was
conducting
probable
cause
hearings
and
when
they
said
there
was
no
probable
cause
for
the
arrest,
that
indicates
that
this
was
a
bad
faith
prosecution
and
therefore
they
enjoined
us
from
prosecuting
even
under
these
valid
constitutional
statutes.
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
reversed
that.
but
they
also
said
there
was
no
finding
even
though
this
court
was
--
that
court
was
open.
the
district
court
was
open
to
present
all
the
sort
of
evidence
what
was
going
on,
these
allegations
of
conspiracy
and
so
on.
there
is
no
finding
that
there
was
--
there
is
no
finding
in
the
district
court
that
there
was
no
expectation
of
convictions
or
that
the
sole
motive
of
the
prosecution
was
to
discouraged
the
exercise
of
civil
rights.
they
have
their
opportunity
to
prove
this
gigantic
conspiracy
that
they
were
talking
about
in
the
complaint
and
they
didn't
prove
it.
i
submit
that
the
opinion
of
three-judge
court
should
be
reversed.
mr.
thomas
e.
brannigan
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
thomas
brannigan.
i'm
the
assistant
states
attorney
of
cook
county,
illinois
and
i
represent
the
appellants
in
this
case.
i
am
the
third
assistant
states
attorney
from
cook
county
to
argue
this
case
in
court
and
i
want
to
say
that
i
hope
that
i
can
bring
new
insights
to
this
appeal,
but
if
i
can't
i
want
to
make
--
let
you
know
that
we
have
accomplished
one
thing
anyway
and
that
is
that
we
have
brought
new
faces
before
the
court
and
i
am
at
least
please
in
that.
mr.
thomas
e.
brannigan
on
the
brief,
yes.
the
statute
that
we're
here
concerned
about
is
the
illinois
intimidation
statute,
and
not
the
entire
statute
but
only
a
subsection
of
the
statute
which
was
held
unconstitutional
by
a
three-judge
court
and
an
injunction
was
issued
in
joining
states
attorney
from
prosecuting
anybody
under
this
statute.
the
statute
provides,
“a
person
commits
intimidation
when,
with
intent
to
cause
another
to
perform
or
to
omit
the
performance
of
any
act,
he
communicates
to
another
a
threat
to
perform
without
lawful
authority
any
of
the
following
acts”.
now
all
the
other
subsections
were
held
constitutional,
but
this
one
subsection,
“commit
any
criminal
offense”
was
held
unconstitutional.
the
reasoning
of
the
court
was
that
this
language
“commit
any
criminal
offense”
would
include
misdemeanors
or
insubstantial
offenses,
and
mere
violations
of
--
against
public
order
statute
only
and
that
it
was
there
for
overbroad
and
unconstitutional.
now
before
i
turn
to
the
question
of
the
finding
of
unconstitutionality
we
have,
as
we
have
in
all
the
cases
that
were
set
down
with
this
case
the
procedural
question.
and
that
is
the
problem
raised
by
the
--
what
is
now
generally
called
the
dombrowski-type
complaint.
and
this
is
the
type
of
complaint
that
was
filed
in
the
district
court
below.
but
we
submit
that
this
is
not
a
dombrowski-type
complaint.
it's
not
as
zwickler
because
in
those
cases
there
was
allegations
and
showing
of
some
prior
activity
by
the
state
officials
under
the
statute
which
the
court
found
unconstitutional.
in
this
case,
nobody,
none
of
the
plaintiffs
were
charged
with
the
violation
of
this
intimidation
statute,
not
any
section
of
it
and
not
this
subsection.
there
was
no
--
the
allegation
that
the
district
court
felt
was
sufficient
to
bring
this
--
the
merits
of
this
statute
to
its
attention
was
the
allegation
that
the
--
that
there
was
a
threat
to
enforce
the
statute
and
that
the
purpose
of
the
threat
and
enforcement
was
to
harass
and
intimidate
the
plaintiffs
who
were
simply
exercising
first
amendment
rights
and
demonstrating,
advocating
for
equality
--
racial
equality
in
chicago.
but
we
submit
that
there
is
a
big
difference
in
this
case
and
in
the
dombrowski
and
zwickler
because
there
was
this
course
of
conduct
that
those
plaintiffs
could
point
to
and
say,
“this
is
how
we're
being
harassed.
this
is
what
the
state
officials
are
doing.”
now,
for
example
one
of
the
subsections
to
which
was
held
constitutional
says
that
one
of
the
threats
made
to
a
person
which
would
constitute
intimidation
would
be
to
take
action
as
a
public
official
against
anyone
or
anything
or
withhold
official
action
or
cause
such
action
or
withholding,
and
yet
none
of
the
plaintiffs
were
public
officials.
none
of
them
were
capable
of
acting
as
public
officials
so
that
they
could
take
action
as
a
public
official
against
anyone
or
anything.
and
yet
the
court
felt
under
dombrowski
that
they
could
reach
all
the
subsections
and
decide
one
after
another
whether
or
not
they
were
constitutional
or
not.
now,
we
of
course
realized
that
if
this
court
were
to
decide
that
the
district
court
should
not
have
reached
this
question
and
there
would
be
a
reversal
on
grounds
other
than
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
below
would
stand
in
effect
in
illinois
as
the
only
decision
interpreting
this
subsection
of
the
illinois
intimidation
statute
and
that
decision
would
be
that
it
was
unconstitutional.
so
we
would
ask
the
court
to,
in
this
case
it
is
our
request
that
if
it
be
possible
that
the
court
also
reach
the
question
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute.
mr.
thomas
e.
brannigan
yes
it
would
and
--
mr.
thomas
e.
brannigan
that's
true
you're
correct,
but
--
mr.
thomas
e.
brannigan
that's
true,
your
honor
but,
nevertheless
that
determination
withstand.
we
would
live
for
--
mr.
thomas
e.
brannigan
well
i
mean
it
would
be,
it
would
be
a
reversal
on
some
other
ground
your
honor
as
--
mr.
thomas
e.
brannigan
now,
what
we
feel
so
strongly
about
the
question
of
the
constitutionality
of
this
statute,
your
honor
that
--
and
we
feel
that
the
district
court
was
wrong
in
finding
the
statute
unconstitutional.
and
i
would
like
to
just
address
myself
immediately
to
that
to
show
you
why
we
feel
so
strongly
about
it.
the
--
i
think
that
the
first
point
that
must
be
made
about
this
statute
is
that
it
is
not
a
public
order
statue.
it's
not
designed
to
maintain
public
order.
it's
not
designed
as
a
protection
of
the
state
of
the
sovereignty,
but
it
is
designed
to
protect
an
individual
from
threats.
and
the
district
court
in
its
opinion
said
that,
“the
term
threat
has
a
sinister
and
well
define
meaning
in
common
parlance
and
in
the
law.”
it
is
the
expression
of
intention
to
inflict
evil
or
injury
on
another.
it
is
more
than
a
mere
expression
of
such
an
intent.
it
is
a
menace,
especially
any
menace
of
such
a
nature
and
extent
as
to
unsettle
the
mind
of
the
person
on
whom
it
operates.
and
to
take
away
from
his
acts
that
free
and
voluntary
action
which
alone
constitutes
consent,
that's
the
kind
of
threat
the
district
court
held
is
what
is
prohibited
by
the
statute.
now
the
court
said
that
that
subsection
(a)
and
all
the
other
subsections
were
not
vague,
they
could
be
understood,
but
they
were
overbroad
and
they
pointed
out
some
examples.
they
said
that
this
statute
would
in
effect
make
legal
threats
by
mothers
to
block
traffic
to
cause
stop
sign
to
be
placed
at
an
intersection
because
it
was
a
dangerous
intersection.
that
it
would
prohibit
threats
by
persons
who
lived
in
a
dangerous
neighborhood
who
threaten
to
carry
arms
because
of
the
dangerous
neighborhood
they
lived
in.
i
think
that
what
the
court
there
does
in
that
language
is
that
it
turns
the
focus
from
this
threat
to
the
person
to
just
advocacy
of
threatening
in
the
abstract.
and
this
statute
does
not
prohibit
people
from
standing
up
in
the
civic
center
in
downtown
chicago
and
saying,
“we
are
going
to
carry
arms
in
our
neighborhood
because
we
live
in
a
bad
neighborhood.”
in
other
words,
we're
going
to
commit
a
crime
because
we
live
in
a
bad
neighborhood.
this
statute
has
nothing
to
do
with
that
type
of
language,
that
type
of
advocacy.
to
the
same
extent
the
mothers
who
want
to
block
traffic,
they
can
talk
about
it
all
they
want.
they
can
advocate
it
and
this
statute
does
not
prohibit
that
type
of
talking
in
speech.
what
it
prohibits
is
threats
directed
towards
somebody
to
deprive
that
person
of
his
free
will
and
it's
got
to
be
that
type
of
sinister
threat
that
freezes
his
free
will
and
makes
him
act
in
a
way
that
he
doesn't
want
to
act.
and
i
think
that
the
proof
that
the
court
misapplied
the
first
amendment
doctrine
enunciated
by
this
court
in
striking
this
statute
down
is
the
statement
in
the
brief
that
--
a
statement
in
the
lower
court
opinion
that
what
the
public
official
--
what
the
state
of
illinois
can
do
is
wait
till
this
threatened
act,
this
minor,
little,
insignificant
violation
of
a
public
order
statute
is
carried
out
and
then
go
ahead
and
prosecute
people
for
violating
that
law.
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
is
that
if
the
threat
to
the
individual
is
successful
that
is,
“you
do
something
or
we
will
carry
you
in
bare
arms.”
then
if
the
threat
is
successful
and
the
person
making
the
threat
has
got
his
point
home
and
has
caused
that
individual
to
act
the
way
he
wants
them
to
act
he
will
not
carry
out
the
threat.
and
so
we
never
--
the
situation
doesn't
arise
where
the
violation,
the
threatened
act
is
ever
carried
out.
so
we
think
that
this
demonstrates
clearly
that
the
district
court
misapply
the
doctrines
enunciated
by
this
court
in
the
first
amendment
and
incorrectly
came
to
the
conclusion
that
this
statute
was
unconstitutional.
now,
we
point
out
in
our
briefs
that
there
are
other
statutes
that
are
wider
drawn
the
federal
hobbs
act
for
example
prohibits
one
from
interfering
with
commerce
by
extortion.
and
this
court
has
upheld
that
statute
where
there
were
threats
simply
to
violate
or
to
breach
a
contract
or
to
cause
a
strike
which
are
certainly
are
broader
than
what
this
statute
prohibits
and
that
is
the
commission
of
a
crime.
i
would
also
maybe
argue
that
this
subsection
is
really
surplusage
because
there
are
other
acts,
other
types
of
threats
that
are
enumerated
in
the
other
subsections
and
that
this
one
really
doesn't
--
we
don't
really
need
this
subsection.
we
think
that
it
was
a
legitimate
exercise
of
the
legislature's
judgment
to
include
the
subsection
so
that
types
of
threats
that
the
legislature
could
not
foresee
which
an
inventive
person
may
devise
to
use
to
intimidate
a
person
are
also
prohibited.
and
that
is
we
think
sufficient
reason
to
defer
to
the
legislative
judgment
here
and
to
approve
the
statute
on
constitutional
grounds.
getting
back
to
the
--
getting
back
to
the
procedural
question
i
must
re-stress
that
our
point
there
is
that
if
this
court
is
presently
considering
a
restatement
of
dombrowski
case
or
doctrines
that
have
emanated
from
it
the
course
of
the
cases
that
have
followed
the
dombrowski
case.
we
think
that
this
case
without
getting
into
a
whole
restatement
of
that
whole
question
can
simply
be
distinguished
by
dombrowski
and
zwickler
on
the
grounds
that
no
one
was
charged
with
intimidation.
there
was
just
a
bare
allegation
in
the
complaint
that
the
threat
was
made
to
use
the
statute
and
that
there
was
no
course
of
conduct
to
which
the
plaintiffs
could
point
to
which
was
anywhere
near
like
what
was
present
in
dombrowski
and
zwickler.
and
which
this
court
well
done
extensively
in
both
of
those
opinions
by
way
of
reaching
the
conclusion
that
the
federal
district
court
had
an
obligation
to
make
a
determination
of
the
constitutionality
of
statutes.
mr.
thomas
e.
brannigan
no
we
don't
because
we
don't
have
any
prosecutions.
mr.
thomas
e.
brannigan
yes,
your
honor
it's
on
the
last
page
of
the
appendix,
page
104.
mr.
thomas
e.
brannigan
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
e.
brannigan
104,
the
last
page
in
the
appendix.
“hereby
ordered
and
adjudged,
and
decreed
that
the
defendants,
their
employees,
servants,
and
agents
be,
and
they
hereby
perpetually
enjoined
and
restrained
from
the
enforcement
of,
or
the
prosecution
under
these
other
statutes,”
your
honor
that
are
mentioned.
there
are
other
statutes,
which
were
held
unconstitutional.
mr.
thomas
e.
brannigan
we
have
not
appealed
from
it.
the
only
section
that
we
appeal
from
is
the
illinois
intimidation
statutes,
which
is
chapter
38
section
12-6
(a)
(3).
mr.
thomas
e.
brannigan
that's
right
your
honor,
and
it's
only
that
little
subsection
that
we're
taking
about.
mr.
thomas
e.
brannigan
thank
you,
your
honor.
when
it
has
been
suggested
that
the
question
of
the
standing
of
the
plaintiffs
to
raise
this
constitutional
objection
to
the
illinois
intimidation
statute,
this
subsection
ought
to
be
sustained
on
pendent
jurisdiction
and
i
think
that
i
disagree
with
that
and
i
do
not
think
it's
called
for.
first
of
all
dombrowski
and
zwickler
were
the
court
said,
extra
ordinary
cases.
nobody
here
has
been
charged
with
the
violation
of
this
intimidation
statute.
nobody
has
been
charged
with
the
violation
of
this
subsection.
i
think
to
take
an
extraordinary
step
like
was
taken
in
dombrowski,
that
alone
i
think
is
the
court
recognized
in
the
opinion,
it
was
taking
a
significant
new
step.
to
now
say
we
can
drag
in
all
sorts
of
challenges
to
state
statutes
on
the
concept
of
pendent
jurisdiction
i
just
think
it's
uncalled
for.
i
think
that
this
would
create
a
monster
that
the
court
will
never
be
able
to
control
if
it
incorporates
the
challenges
to
statute
whether
they
are
being
used
or
not
or
ever
has
been
used
against
the
plaintiffs
in
a
complaint
drawn
like
the
complaint
in
the
lower
court
and
say
we
want
an
adjudication
of
all
these
statutes
whether
or
not
they
are
constitutional
or
not.
i
think
that's
the
step
that
this
court
shouldn't
take.
now,
so
far
as
what
was
going
on
chicago
on
1976,
mr.
reid
has
been
talking
a
lot
of
things
here
that
i
don't
know
if
they
occurred
or
not
but
they
put
us
in
a
bad
light.
the
fact
remains
however
that
i
think
that
one
thing
--
the
fact
--
one
fact,
that
court
can
take
notice
of
is
an
appeal.
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
which
was
decided
on
february
5,
1970
and
cause
number
17346
entitled
boyle
versus
landry.
this
was
another
aspect
of
this
case
where
the
court
decided
that
certain
sections
challenged
in
this
action
were
constitutional.
it
remanded
the
case
to
the
single-judge
court
and
said,
“now,
you
determine
whether
or
not
they
are
being
applied
unconstitutionally.”
and
there
were
hearings
held
and
witnesses
were
brought
in.
these
people
who
have
been
arrested
said
we
were
peacefully
demonstrating.
we
weren't
doing
anything
and
the
police
came
along
and
charged
us
with
violations
of
all
these
statutes
which
the
three-judge
court
had
just
held
were
constitutional
statute
and
we
were
not
doing
anything
except
exercising
first
amendment
rights
and
here
we
are
being
charged
with
this
things.
and
the
single
judge
said
that
shows
they
are
being
tried,
you
do
not
have
evidence
here
to
--
we
didn't
offer
any
evidence
whatsoever.
we
said
to
the
courts
should
submit
to
the
bar
of
2283.
the
court
was
conducting
probable
cause
hearings
and
when
they
said
there
was
no
probable
cause
for
the
arrest,
that
indicates
that
this
was
a
bad
faith
prosecution
and
therefore
they
enjoined
us
from
prosecuting
even
under
these
valid
constitutional
statutes.
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
reversed
that.
but
they
also
said
there
was
no
finding
even
though
this
court
was
--
that
court
was
open.
the
district
court
was
open
to
present
all
the
sort
of
evidence
what
was
going
on,
these
allegations
of
conspiracy
and
so
on.
there
is
no
finding
that
there
was
--
there
is
no
finding
in
the
district
court
that
there
was
no
expectation
of
convictions
or
that
the
sole
motive
of
the
prosecution
was
to
discouraged
the
exercise
of
civil
rights.
they
have
their
opportunity
to
prove
this
gigantic
conspiracy
that
they
were
talking
about
in
the
complaint
and
they
didn't
prove
it.
i
submit
that
the
opinion
of
three-judge
court
should
be
reversed.
