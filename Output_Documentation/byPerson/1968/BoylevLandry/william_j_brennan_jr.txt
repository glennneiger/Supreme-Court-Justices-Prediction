justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
is
the
situation
different
at
the
time
of
the
judgment
you
were
calling
golden
and
we
felt
that
the
three-judge
court
had
erred
in
making
this
determination
of
case
of
controversy
on
the
allegations
alone
rather
than
on
the
situation
as
it's
existed
at
the
time
of
the
remain?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
what's
your
position?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that
we
do
have
to
go
back
then
to
the
complaint
itself?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
know
but
this
argument
based
on
golden
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
get
clear.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
this
an
argument
that
even
on
the
face
of
the
complaint
there's
no
case
of
controversy
in
the
sense
of
a
live
fight
alleged
within
the
four
corners
of
the
complaint?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
alright.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
may
i
understand
this?
your
proofs
would've
gone
only
so
far
as
to
show
that
there
had
been
as
i
understand
you
meetings
of
these
various
law
enforcement
authorities
where
there
had
been
discussion
each
of
the
statutes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
that
they
in
the
event
certain
things
happened
they
would
bring
to
bear
these
statutes,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
was
there
ever
anything
in
the
way
of
coming
anyone
of
these
appellees
and
saying
in
this
is
what
we're
going
to
do
if
you
do
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
don't
have
any
allegation
in
here
do
you
that
that
threat
of
the
kind
that
i've
just
suggested
was
ever
made?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
would
suppose
law
enforcement
authorities
must
be
doing
this
sort
of
thing
everything
in
the
week,
aren't
they?
they
got
anticipate
if
certain
things
arise
they
may
have
to
bring
the
bear
in
the
circumstances
particular
statutes,
don't
they?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
it
might
be
not
what
i'm
telling
--
i'm
not
thinking
to
those
so
much
as
i
can
the
issue
which
of
course
we
dealt
with
here
only
in
golden
since
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
issue
where
i
don't
see
how
you
frankly
how
this
alleges
within
the
principle
of
golden,
a
case
of
controversy.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
then
everyone
of
this
case
is
so
far
mr.
reid
i
think
this
is
right,
isn't
it
in
the
golden,
zwickler
had
been
arrested
and
convicted
on
one
occasion
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
violation
of
the
statute
involved.
in
cameron
and
johnson
after
the
statute
was
enacted
the
police
came
down
and
they
arrested
all
of
the
picketers.
in
dombrowski,
we
had
raids
on
the
plaintiffs'
offices
and
the
call
and
taking
all
that
papers
and
all
of
the
rest
of
it.
and
i
guess
actual
indictments
of
them
under
some
of
those
louisiana's
statutes.
now,
you're
carrying
us
pretty
far,
aren't
you?
we
suggest
that
merely,
merely
because
officers
get
together
and
decide
that
they're
going
to
cope
with
this
developing
situation
by
applying
this
and
not
any
of
statute
but
no
threat
of
any
kind
to
any
particular
individual
under
your
client
was
in
fact
threatened
to
the
prosecution
under
this
or
in
fact
threatened
that
the
statute
will
be
brought
to
bear
if
he
carried
on
misconduct.
we
don't
have
anything
like
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
what
i'm
suggesting
mr.
reid
is
that
the
cases
where
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
this
issue
or
isn't
have
all
been
cases
where
on
the
fact
the
statute
was
actually
applied
against
the
plaintiff
who
sought
the
relief,
the
declaratory
relief.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
here,
at
least
we
don't
have
that
factual
situation.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
was
that
argued
in
the
context
of
case
of
controversy?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
doesn't
appear
on
this
judge
will's
opinion
on
motion
to
dismiss.
have
you
dealt
with
this
in
the
context
of
declaratory
judgment
but
rather
in
the
injunctive
relief?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes
mr.
reid
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
was
an
absent
by
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
where
are
the
two
statements?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
many
in
the
state?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
is
the
situation
different
at
the
time
of
the
judgment
you
were
calling
golden
and
we
felt
that
the
three-judge
court
had
erred
in
making
this
determination
of
case
of
controversy
on
the
allegations
alone
rather
than
on
the
situation
as
it's
existed
at
the
time
of
the
remain?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
what's
your
position?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that
we
do
have
to
go
back
then
to
the
complaint
itself?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
know
but
this
argument
based
on
golden
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
get
clear.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
this
an
argument
that
even
on
the
face
of
the
complaint
there's
no
case
of
controversy
in
the
sense
of
a
live
fight
alleged
within
the
four
corners
of
the
complaint?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
alright.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
may
i
understand
this?
your
proofs
would've
gone
only
so
far
as
to
show
that
there
had
been
as
i
understand
you
meetings
of
these
various
law
enforcement
authorities
where
there
had
been
discussion
each
of
the
statutes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
that
they
in
the
event
certain
things
happened
they
would
bring
to
bear
these
statutes,
is
that
it?
justice
william

what
we're

if
you

justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
don't
have
any
allegation
in
here
do
you
that
that
threat
of
the
kind
that
i've
just
suggested
was
ever
made?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
would
suppose
law
enforcement
authorities
must
be
doing
this
sort
of
thing
everything
in
the
week,
aren't
they?
they
got
anticipate
if
certain
things
arise
they
may
have
to
bring
the
bear
in
the
circumstances
particular
statutes,
don't
they?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
it
might
be
not
what
i'm
telling
--
i'm
not
thinking
to
those
so
much
as
i
can
the
issue
which
of
course
we
dealt
with
here
only
in
golden
since
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
issue
where
i
don't
see
how
you
frankly
how
this
alleges
within
the
principle
of
golden,
a
case
of
controversy.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
then
everyone
of
this
case
is
so
far
mr.
reid
i
think
this
is

isn't

in
the

we
don't

anything
like

justice
william
j.
brennan,

now,
what
i'm
suggesting
mr.
reid
is
that
the
cases
where
--
justice
william

and
here,
at

we
don't
have
that
factual
situation.
justice
william

and
was
that
argued
in

justice

it

where
are

how

in
