mr.

mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
ronald
butler
mr.
chief
justice,
your
honors,
this
is
an
appeal
from
a
permanent
injunctive
order
issued
by
a
three-judge
court
in
northern
district
of
illinois
which
order
for
purposes
of
this
appeal
held
unconstitutional
one
sub-section
of
the
illinois
intimidation
statute.
illinois
revised
statutes,
chapter
38,
section
12-6
(a)
(3).
jurisdiction
is
conferred
upon
this
court
by
a
title
28,
section
1253
and
2281.
probable
jurisdiction
was
noted
on
the
9th
of
december
1968.
the
posture
of
this
case
in
the
lower
court
is
as
follows:
a
complaint
was
filed
by
the
plaintiffs
purported
alleging
a
conspiracy
to
violate
the
plaintiffs'
constitutional
right
and
setting
forth
that
by
the
use
of
unconstitutional
statutes
on
their
face
or
statute
or
the
misuse
of
statutes
which
would
be
otherwise
constitutional
that
the
plaintiff's'
constitutional
rights
were
violated.
the
defendants'
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
initially
alleging
four
basic
grounds.
first,
lack
of
jurisdiction,
second,
no
relief
upon
which
your
claim
can
be
granted,
third,
as
to
those
sub-classifications
of
plaintiffs
who
had
been
arrested
prior
to
the
filing
of
the
complaint
for
federal
equitable
jurisdiction
the
bar
of
28
u.s.c.
2283.
and
lastly,
as
to
those
class
of
plaintiffs
who
had
not
been
arrested
but
who
were
plaintiffs
in
the
case
the
claim
that
the
lack
of
specificity
in
the
complaint
takes
jurisdiction
away
from
the
district
court.
the
single
trial
judge
dismissed
the
motion
to
dismiss
filed
by
the
defendants.
in
doing
so,
he
stated
that
the
plaintiffs
did
have
proper
standing
that
the
question
of
2283
was
a
premature
question
because
that
statute
was
not
jurisdictional
that
a
three-judge
court
would
be
convened
and
the
first
order
of
business
upon
convening
the
three-judge
court
would
be
to
determine
the
threshold
question
of
constitutionality
with
respect
to
the
five
enumerated
statutes
which
the
plaintiffs
have
challenged.
the
appellants
thereby
filed
an
answer,
denying
the
material
allegations
of
the
complaint
and
specifically
in
an
affirmative
series
of
affirmative
defenses
setting
forth
those
statements
which
we
made
in
a
motion
to
dismiss.
now,
the
statue
in
question
reads
as
follows:
a
person
commits
intimidation
when
with
intent
to
cause
another
to
perform
or
to
omit
the
performance
of
an
act
he
communicates
to
another
a
threat
to
perform
without
lawful
authority
anyone
of
the
following
acts
in
sub-section
3
commit
a
criminal
offense.
the
lower
court
held
that
the
statute
in
question
was
overbroad
because
it
prohibited
insubstantial
evil.
they
said
that
the
commission
of
offenses
against
public
order
only
is
not
such
a
substantial
evil
that
the
state
may
prohibit
the
threat
of
it
and
they
further
stated
that
the
prohibition
of
insubstantial
evil
is
outweighed
by
legitimate
political
discussion
on
a
wide
birth.
there
are
two
issues
presented
for
review
in
this
case.
one,
whether
the
plaintiffs
have
sufficient
requisites
standing
to
entitle
them
to
determination
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
intimidation
statute
and
two,
if
they
do
have
such
standing
whether
the
first
amendment
prohibition
against
the
abridgement
of
speech
is
violated
by
a
state
statute
which
prohibits
threats
to
commit
a
criminal
offense
where
the
intention
is
to
force
another
to
surrender
his
freedom
of
choice.
now,
as
to
the
standing
point,
the
complaint
shows
the
constitutional
validity
of
five
illinois
statutes:
the
map
violating
statute,
resisting
arrest,
aggravated
assault,
aggravated
battery,
and
intimidation.
there
are
seven
sub-classes
of
plaintiffs.
six
of
the
sub-classes
have
been
arrested
in
incidents
prior
to
the
filing
of
the
federal
declaratory
complaint
and
whose
cases
were
presently
pending
at
the
time
that
the
federal
declaratory
suit
was
filed.
mr.
ronald
butler
none
were
under
the
intimidation
statute,
your
honor.
now,
as
far
as
the
complainants
who
were
not
arrested
but
who
were
party's
plaintiff,
the
complaint
is
the
appellants'
view
it
show
no
specificity
with
respect
to
the
--
with
respect
to
any
factual
allegations
which
can
be
shown
to
depict
a
depravation
of
constitutional
right.
in
my
view,
reading
the
37
paragraph
complaint
there
are
six
paragraphs
which
have
anything
at
all
to
do
with
the
intimidation
statute
and
with
the
sub-classification
of
the
plaintiffs
who
have
challenged
the
statute
under
it.
that
was
paragraphs
8,
24,
and
25,
paragraphs
34,
37
(b)
and
37
(f)
but
in
each
of
those
six
paragraphs,
the
complaint
is
devoid
of
any
specificity
effect.
all
we
see
are
conclusory
allegations.
i
am
intimidated
because
of
the
intimidation
statute.
now,
the
purported
foundation
for
this
case
lies
in
two
cases,
dombrowski
versus
pfister
and
zwickler
versus
koota
but
in
both
of
those
cases,
your
honors,
there
were
specificity
effects
at
least
in
dombrowski
there
were
affidavits
filed,
there
were
offers
of
proof
made
in
both
dombrowski
and
in
zwickler.
we
have
situations
where
there
were
prior
arrests
even
though
the
arrests
were
not
pending
at
the
time
of
the
federal
declaratory
relief.
and
lastly,
there
was
in
the
complaint
a
specific
contention
shown
by
the
defendants
to
future
arrest,
to
future
violation
of
the
plaintiffs'
constitutional
rights.
i
submit
that
this
case
does
not
fall
within
the
precept
of
dombrowski
and
zwickler
but
rather
falls
with
the
concept
of
dubois
versus
clark
and
the
recent
case
of
golden
versus
zwickler.
in
dubois,
this
court
declined
to
hear
a
situation
where
they
said
that
the
--
were
just
this
court
said
that
the
no
specificity
at
all
is
shown.
in
golden
versus
zwickler,
we
had
a
situation
where
the
court
stated
that
the
complaint
failed
to
present
probably
because
of
the
specificity
--
lack
of
specificity
of
the
complaint
fail
to
present
an
actual
case
or
controversy.
it
is
our
opinion
that
the
present
complaint
fails
both
to
shows
specificity
or
to
show
an
actual
case
or
controversy.
mr.
ronald
butler
yes.
well,
--
mr.
ronald
butler
we
don't
have
any
facts,
your
honor.
we
have
no
facts.
mr.
ronald
butler
we
have
to
go
back
to
the
complaint
itself
for
purpose
of
the
jurisdictional
argument,
yes.
we
would
be
in
the
same
situation
as
zwickler
versus
golden
before
this
court's
second
try.
mr.
ronald
butler
yes.
mr.
ronald
butler
that's
our
allegation,
--
mr.
ronald
butler
--
yes.
unless
this
court
is
prepared
to
allow
that
much
more
wide
of
latitude
than
it
seemed
that
the
intendment
of
dombrowski
was
designed
to
protect.
yes.
secondly,
as
to
the
issue
on
the
merits,
the
appellants
contend
that
a
statute
which
prohibits
threats
to
commit
a
criminal
offense
where
the
threats
are
intended
to
force
another,
to
surrender
their
freedom
of
choice
is
not
within
the
purview
of
the
first
amendment.
we
contend
this
upon
two
factors.
first,
in
analysis
of
the
thrust
of
the
statute;
and
secondly
the
scope
of
the
first
amendment
with
respect
to
threaten
conduct
where
the
intention
is
to
force
another
to
surrender
their
freedom
of
choice.
the
lower
court
in
this
case
in
a
very
fine
opinion
found
that
the
intimidation
statute
as
a
whole
was
designed
to
protect
communications
intended
to
compel
another
to
act
against
his
will.
the
court
defined
a
threat
then
and
they
said
a
threat
was
an
expression
of
an
intention
to
inflict
harm
or
evil
against
another.
they
said
that
it
was
more
than
a
mere
intention
however
that
it
was
a
menace
that
it
must
unsettle
the
mind
of
the
person
on
whom
it
operates
and
then
it
must
take
away
from
his
acts
that
free
and
voluntary
choice
which
would
alone
constitute
consent.
they
set
further
that
the
expression
of
that
threat
must
have
a
reasonable
tendency
to
be
carried
out
by
the
threatener
according
to
its
tenor.
this
is
the
definition
of
threat,
this
is
a
definition
we
abide
by
now
yet
when
the
lower
court
approach
to
sub-section
involved
it
shifted
its
emphasis
from
the
substantiality
of
the
threat
to
the
substantiality
of
the
crime.
this,
we
feel
is
what
precipitated
the
error
in
the
lower
court's
decision.
the
lower
court
itself
stated
earlier
that
the
substantiality
of
the
crime
was
not
really
the
important
thing
because
they
said
that
a
mere
expression
of
intent
to
commit
a
criminal
act
was
not
itself
sufficient
under
the
statute
that
we
need
the
final
element
of
extortion
which
completes
the
prohibited
act,
which
is
the
taking
away
of
that
free
and
voluntary
action
which
alone
constitutes
consent.
so
the
substantiality
of
the
evil
must
go
to
the
threat
and
to
the
fear
committed
by
that
threat
as
far
as
the
object
of
the
threat
is
concerned,
the
victim,
and
not
to
the
substantiality
or
the
insubstantiality
of
the
crime
threat.
the
court
made
three
illustrations
to
justify
proposed
--
their
proposed
opinion
and
the
three
illustrations
were
the
following:
a
group
of
dissidents
who
asked
for
certain
things
or
will
commit
disorderly
conduct,
people
in
a
high
crime
neighborhood
who
asked
for
more
police
protection
are
failing
to
get
a
threat
and
to
carry
conceal
weapons,
and
finally,
group
of
mothers
who
threatened
to
block
a
highway
should
they
not
get
a
traffic
regulatory
signal.
and
the
lower
court
was
of
the
opinion
that
since
those
crimes
that
they
threaten
was
so
insubstantial
when
measured
against
legitimate
political
discussion
on
a
wide
birth
that
the
first
amendment
should
then
protect
those
statements.
in
those
examples,
the
court
in
looking
to
the
crime
threat
failed
to
observe
the
main
purpose
in
spirit
of
the
statute
toward
the
person
threatened.
the
substantiality
of
the
threat
could
be
great
and
the
substantiality
of
the
crime
need
not
be
great,
need
be
insignificant
and
can
be
insignificant.
one
example
of
this
would
be
a
threat
by
an
individual
to
burn
two
pieces
of
lumber
placed
together
in
the
form
of
a
cross
in
an
open
field
next
to
a
school
which
is
to
be
integrated
the
next
day.
a
situation
involving
a
substantial
threat,
but
yet
of
an
insubstantial
crime.
a
further
example
individuals
on
a
campus
who
approach
the
chancellor
and
tell
the
chancellor
that
unless
their
demands
are
met
within
five
days,
that
they
are
going
to
disrupt
classes,
that
they
are
going
to
take
over
his
office,
they're
not
going
to
threaten
him
personally
or
physically,
they're
not
going
to
destroy
the
building
but
they're
just
going
to
make
it
impossible
for
the
school
to
function.
this
would
be
a
situation
where
the
threat
would
be
very
substantial
but
yet
the
crime
might
be
nothing
more
than
disorderly
conduct.
it
is
appellant's
contention
that
this
type
of
examples
along
with
the
example
cited
by
the
lower
court
which
fall
within
the
purview
in
concept
to
this
statute
and
that
the
statute
is
valid.
in
essence
then
with
the
lower
court
seems
to
be
saying
is
that
the
threat
of
an
insignificant
crime
when
they
said
that
the
threat
of
an
insignificant
crime
should
not
be
punished,
they
are
really
saying
that
a
little
bit
of
illegality
is
not
so
bad
and
can
be
protected
by
the
first
amendment
so
long
as
speech
is
involved.
in
examining
this
issue
in
the
light
of
first
amendment
protections,
it
doesn't
seem
to
meet
the
category
of
the
first
amendment
preserves.
an
extortion
by
threat
is
not
the
advocacy
of
ideas,
it's
not
the
teaching
of
ideas
and
it's
not
the
exposition
of
ideas.
it's
not
legitimate
political
discussion
on
a
wide
birth.
the
entire
history
of
the
cases
of
this
court
from
baldwin
versus
robertson
in
1896,
to
the
statement
made
in
carroll
versus
president
and
board
of
commissioners
of
saint
anne's
county
late
last
year
seem
to
indicate
that
speech
uttered
in
a
context
of
violence
or
speech
uttered
to
follow
an
illegal
course
of
conduct
are
not
prohibited
--
are
prohibited
rather
by
the
first
amendment.
the
first
amendment
should
not
protect
that
type
of
conduct.
and
on
our
brief
on
page
18
and
19,
we
have
set
forth
a
myriad
of
cases
respecting
this
point.
i
should
just
like
to
mention
a
few.
in
bridges
versus
california
where
this
court
a
contempt
case
where
this
court
reversed
the
contempt
conviction,
this
court
was
very
clear
to
point
out
that
under
no
construction
therefore
and
i'm
quoting
directly,
“under
no
construction
therefore,
can
we
take
the
telegram
of
bridges
to
be
a
threat
to
follow
an
illegal
course
of
conduct?”
in
chaplinsky
versus
new
hampshire
where
this
court
said
fighting
words
are
no
essential
part
of
any
exposition
of
ideas.
in
american
communications
versus
douds
where
the
majority
set
the
government
may
cutoff
a
speaker
only
when
his
views
are
no
longer
merely
views
but
threatened
clearly
and
imminently
to
ripen
into
conduct
into
which
the
public
has
a
right
to
protect.
and
even
roth
and
smith
in
the
concurring
and
dissenting
opinions,
the
dissenters
or
the
individuals
who
concurred
stated
that
freedom
of
expression
can
be
suppressed
if
and
to
the
extent,
it
is
so
closely
brigaded
with
illegal
action
as
to
be
an
inseparable
part
of
it.
your
honors,
the
approval
of
a
little
bit
of
illegality
constitutes
the
doctrine
of
permissive
lawlessness
which
this
court
has
never
sanctioned
and
which
i
hope
it
never
will.
how
can
we
allow
individuals
or
pressure
groups
to
exact
gain
from
others
based
upon
the
threat
to
commit
a
criminal
offense
and
at
the
same
time
maintain
that
we
lived
under
a
system
of
order,
under
a
system
where
first
amendment
rights
are
protected
under
a
system
or
individual
rights
are
first
and
foremost?
i
don't
think
we
could
live
with
the
opinion
of
the
lower
court
in
so
state.
in
conclusion,
the
effect
of
the
decision
of
the
lower
court
is
to
insulate
via
the
first
amendment
threatened
acts
which
force
other
individuals
to
surrender
their
freedom
of
choice.
the
statute
under
consideration
when
measured
by
the
scope
of
the
decisions
of
this
court
failed
to
transgress
upon
the
sanctity
of
free
expression
of
ideas,
since
the
protection
of
the
right
of
another
as
freedom
of
choice
stands
upon
as
equal
footing
as
the
right
of
the
speaker
to
say
it.
mr.
ronald
butler
yes,
sir.
mr.
ronald
butler
yes,
he
challenges,
yes.
did
you
ask
if
my
opponent
challenged
it,
your
honor?
mr.
ronald
butler
yes,
he
says
that
there
is
sufficient
standard.
mr.
ronald
butler
that's
correct.
no
one
was
--
mr.
ronald
butler
there's
an
allegation
--
yes,
there
is
an
allegation
that
they
were
threatened
but
it
is
our
contention
that
the
allegation
and
the
complaint
is
conclusion
only.
there
are
no
facts
to
support
that.
they
said
that
they
were
threatened,
yes.
mr.
ronald
butler
yes.
mr.
ronald
butler
that's
correct.
mr.
ronald
butler
that's
correct
although
later
on
they
then
restate
in
a
conclusory
fashion
that
they
are
intimidated
and
harassed
by
the
intimidation
statute,
yes.
mr.
ronald
butler
no.
mr.
ronald
butler
no,
they
don't
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
butler
that's
correct.
mr.
ronald
butler
they
alleged
that
they
feel
threatened,
yes.
that's
my
reading
of
the
complaint,
yes.
mr.
ronald
butler
yes.
mr.
ronald
butler
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
ronald
butler
i
think
it's
conclusory,
yes.
i
think
we
need
something
along
the
lines
of
dombrowski
in
the
sense
of
when
and
how
and
where,
how
did
this
happen,
can
you
just
say
that
i
have
been
intimidated?
mr.
ronald
butler
i
think
there
are
many
demonstrations
that
one
could
engage
in
and
still
live
with
the
statute,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
butler
maybe
i
didn't
understand.
mr.
ronald
butler
i
think
it
is,
yes.
i
think
it's
quite
general.
mr.
ronald
butler
no,
i
think
it
would
be
--
i
think
it
would
be
more
valid
to
say
that
we
were
going
to
involve
ourselves
in
the
demonstration
that
we
have
been
specifically
harassed
by
police
officers
--
mr.
ronald
butler
i
would
think
that
there
should
be,
yes.
yes.
mr.
ronald
butler
some
allegation
of
it,
yes.
mr.
ronald
butler
yes,
this
is
the
only
statute
with
its
seven
sub
points,
one
of
which
is
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
ronald
butler
well,
they
--
no,
no,
no.
well,
they
said
it
was
maybe
that's
true
but
the
basis
of
it
is
it
violates
the
fourteenth
amendment
because
it's
overbroad
because
it
sweeps
unnecessary
broadly
over
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
ronald
butler
yes,
absolutely
with
respect
to
sub-section
(a)
(3),
yes.
mr.
ronald
butler
which
is
the
only
sub-section
on
appeal
before
this
court,
yes,
but
the
--
mr.
ronald
butler
i
couldn't
believe
that
that's
true
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
butler
that
would
be
correct,
yes.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
butler
that's
correct.
it
would
have
to
come
under
one
of
the
other
sections
and
may
i
state
to
the
court
that
there
are
other
specifically
enumerated
crimes
such
as
bribery,
perjury,
theft,
pass
of
anything
which
conspires
concealed
weapons
are
concerned
which
be
within
the
confines
of
sub-section
(a)
(3)
but
not
within
the
confines
of
sub-sections
(1),
(2),
(4),
(5),
(6)
and
(7)
which
would
fall
as
well
along
with
this
legitimate
political
discussion.
mr.
ronald
butler
i
believe
so,
your
honor.
i
think
the
legislature
try
to
make
specific
wherever
they
can
and
each
of
the
sub-sections
and
then
they
put
in
the
final
section
which
still
was
narrow
limited
to
the
prevention
of
threats
to
commit
a
crime
and
still
take
in
the
areas
which
were
not
covered
by
the
other
sub-sections.
mr.
ronald
butler
no,
not
against
the
extortion,
your
honor.
we
have
the
specific
criminal
sections
when
the
act
is
completed
as
far
as
the
extortion
is
concerned
--
mr.
ronald
butler
except
for
section
33
(3)
which
have
to
do
with
extortion
by
public
officials
which
is
the
old
common
law
extortion.
that's
the
only
other
extortion
intimidation
statute
we
have,
yes.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
butler
several
short
points
on
rebuttal,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
butler
first
of
all
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
white's
question
with
respect
to
the
pleadings
on
page
30
of
the
appendix,
first
point
under
the
motion
to
dismiss
is
that
this
court
has
no
jurisdiction
and
it's
been
re-alleged
--
mr.
ronald
butler
it
was
argued
in
the
context
of
case
of
controversy
and
the
memorandum
that
was
filed,
yes
which
is
not
a
part
of
the
appendix.
mr.
ronald
butler
he
dealt
with
in
the
context
of
dombrowski
generally,
your
honor
where
there
is
a
statement
i
believe
on
page
487
of
dombrowski
which
said
that
the
minimum
requirements
of
standing
i
have
been
lessen
and
the
court
--
the
three-judge
court
on
page
64
of
the
appendix
footnotes
25
and
26
repeated
that
statement
and
in
the
manner
and
which
seem
to
indicate
that
the
standing
requirement
was
lessened.
mr.
ronald
butler
yes,
i
believe
and
i'll
furnish
to
him.
i
believe
he
tried
to
attribute
it
toward
the
declaratory
judgment
face
not
the
injunctive
face.
i
think
he
is
--
mr.
ronald
butler
well,
no.
well,
maybe
not
in
the
opinion
i
mean
probably
not
in
the
record
but
i
was
cognizant
at
least
--
mr.
ronald
butler
no,
that's
--
mr.
ronald
butler
that's
correct
but
we
must
remember
that
zwickler
versus
koota
had
been
decided
at
the
time
of
this
and
he
was
cognizant
though
but
although
it
doesn't
appear.
also
as
far
as
paragraph
34
is
concern,
your
honor,
i
see
no
different
between
the
allegations
which
i
can
contend
that
conclusory
in
that
respect
or
in
a
civil
case
where
i
state
that
some
else
was
negligent
and
someone
else
committed
it
toward
against
me.
i
think
that's
conclusory,
i
don't
think
that
has
any
kind
of
even
quasi-specificity
and
i
think
i
could
take
paragraph
34
and
i've
as
have
been
pointed
out
by
one
of
the
justices
earlier
and
include
every
single
state
of
illinois
criminal
statute
in
paragraph
34
because
all
i
have
to
say
that
i'm
in
fear.
mr.
ronald
butler
well,
i
think
that's
the
same
allegation
could
be
made.
the
defendants
have
threatened
to
use
every
single
statute.
mr.
ronald
butler
i
think
so,
yes.
because
a
motion
to
dismiss
admits
all
well
pleaded
allegations
but
the
question
is
whether
that's
well
pleaded.
mr.
ronald
butler
no,
i
would
admit
only
well
pleaded
allegations
and
something
says
i've
been
threaten,
it's
the
same
of
saying
i've
had
it
toward
committed
against
me.
mr.
ronald
butler
someone
has
been
negligent.
mr.
ronald
butler
when
someone
says
a
defendant
is
threatened,
that's
a
conclusion.
how
did
the
threat
come
above?
that's
a
conclusion
based
upon
something
else
with
something
else
is
not
involved
here.
mr.
ronald
butler
i
respectfully
disagree
with
as
far
as
that's
concern.
i
think
it's
not.
mr.
ronald
butler
i
think
a
conclusion
is
something
that's
based
upon
series
of
other
statements.
i
can't
say
that
i
committed
a
negligent
act
against
you
and
have
a
complaint
with
stand
and
motion
to
dismiss.
i
can
say
that
you
injured
me
as
far
as
certain
time
and
place
in
automobile
when
you
went
into
the
back
of
my
automobile.
i
could
make
a
conclusion
from
the
basis
of
those
statements
but
i
can't
just
make
the
statement
and
expect
to
withstand
a
motion
to
dismiss.
mr.
ronald
butler
no,
i
have
no
cases
your
honor.
i
--
mr.
ronald
butler
no,
i've
been
--
dombrowski
and
zwickler
and
the
rest
of
the
cases
have
been
quite
difficult
and
up
until
golden
versus
zwickler
was
taken,
i
didn't
know
myself
whether
standing
argument
would
be
sufficient
in
this
case.
mr.
ronald
butler
i
think
there
would
have
to
be
something
more
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
butler
like
time,
like
place
--
mr.
ronald
butler
well,
--
mr.
ronald
butler
it
can,
yes.
it
can
be
over
this
time.
mr.
ronald
butler
no,
i'm
not
running
away
from
it,
your
honor.
i'm
not
running
away
from
it
at
all.
the
answer
was
filed,
there
was
a
denial.
mr.
ronald
butler
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
ronald
butler
mr.
chief
justice,
your
honors,
this
is
an
appeal
from
a
permanent
injunctive
order
issued
by
a
three-judge
court
in
northern
district
of
illinois
which
order
for
purposes
of
this
appeal
held
unconstitutional
one
sub-section
of
the
illinois
intimidation
statute.
illinois
revised
statutes,
chapter
38,
section
12-6
(a)
(3).
jurisdiction
is
conferred
upon
this
court
by
a
title
28,
section
1253
and
2281.
probable
jurisdiction
was
noted
on
the
9th
of
december
1968.
the
posture
of
this
case
in
the
lower
court
is
as
follows:
a
complaint
was
filed
by
the
plaintiffs
purported
alleging
a
conspiracy
to
violate
the
plaintiffs'
constitutional
right
and
setting
forth
that
by
the
use
of
unconstitutional
statutes
on
their
face
or
statute
or
the
misuse
of
statutes
which
would
be
otherwise
constitutional
that
the
plaintiff's'
constitutional
rights
were
violated.
the
defendants'
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
initially
alleging
four
basic
grounds.
first,
lack
of
jurisdiction,
second,
no
relief
upon
which
your
claim
can
be
granted,
third,
as
to
those
sub-classifications
of
plaintiffs
who
had
been
arrested
prior
to
the
filing
of
the
complaint
for
federal
equitable
jurisdiction
the
bar
of
28
u.s.c.
2283.
and
lastly,
as
to
those
class
of
plaintiffs
who
had
not
been
arrested
but
who
were
plaintiffs
in
the
case
the
claim
that
the
lack
of
specificity
in
the
complaint
takes
jurisdiction
away
from
the
district
court.
the
single
trial
judge
dismissed
the
motion
to
dismiss
filed
by
the
defendants.
in
doing
so,
he
stated
that
the
plaintiffs
did
have
proper
standing
that
the
question
of
2283
was
a
premature
question
because
that
statute
was
not
jurisdictional
that
a
three-judge
court
would
be
convened
and
the
first
order
of
business
upon
convening
the
three-judge
court
would
be
to
determine
the
threshold
question
of
constitutionality
with
respect
to
the
five
enumerated
statutes
which
the
plaintiffs
have
challenged.
the
appellants
thereby
filed
an
answer,
denying
the
material
allegations
of
the
complaint
and
specifically
in
an
affirmative
series
of
affirmative
defenses
setting
forth
those
statements
which
we
made
in
a
motion
to
dismiss.
now,
the
statue
in
question
reads
as
follows:
a
person
commits
intimidation
when
with
intent
to
cause
another
to
perform
or
to
omit
the
performance
of
an
act
he
communicates
to
another
a
threat
to
perform
without
lawful
authority
anyone
of
the
following
acts
in
sub-section
3
commit
a
criminal
offense.
the
lower
court
held
that
the
statute
in
question
was
overbroad
because
it
prohibited
insubstantial
evil.
they
said
that
the
commission
of
offenses
against
public
order
only
is
not
such
a
substantial
evil
that
the
state
may
prohibit
the
threat
of
it
and
they
further
stated
that
the
prohibition
of
insubstantial
evil
is
outweighed
by
legitimate
political
discussion
on
a
wide
birth.
there
are
two
issues
presented
for
review
in
this
case.
one,
whether
the
plaintiffs
have
sufficient
requisites
standing
to
entitle
them
to
determination
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
intimidation
statute
and
two,
if
they
do
have
such
standing
whether
the
first
amendment
prohibition
against
the
abridgement
of
speech
is
violated
by
a
state
statute
which
prohibits
threats
to
commit
a
criminal
offense
where
the
intention
is
to
force
another
to
surrender
his
freedom
of
choice.
now,
as
to
the
standing
point,
the
complaint
shows
the
constitutional
validity
of
five
illinois
statutes:
the
map
violating
statute,
resisting
arrest,
aggravated
assault,
aggravated
battery,
and
intimidation.
there
are
seven
sub-classes
of
plaintiffs.
six
of
the
sub-classes
have
been
arrested
in
incidents
prior
to
the
filing
of
the
federal
declaratory
complaint
and
whose
cases
were
presently
pending
at
the
time
that
the
federal
declaratory
suit
was
filed.
mr.
ronald
butler
none
were
under
the
intimidation
statute,
your
honor.
now,
as
far
as
the
complainants
who
were
not
arrested
but
who
were
party's
plaintiff,
the
complaint
is
the
appellants'
view
it
show
no
specificity
with
respect
to
the
--
with
respect
to
any
factual
allegations
which
can
be
shown
to
depict
a
depravation
of
constitutional
right.
in
my
view,
reading
the
37
paragraph
complaint
there
are
six
paragraphs
which
have
anything
at
all
to
do
with
the
intimidation
statute
and
with
the
sub-classification
of
the
plaintiffs
who
have
challenged
the
statute
under
it.
that
was
paragraphs
8,
24,
and
25,
paragraphs
34,
37
(b)
and
37
(f)
but
in
each
of
those
six
paragraphs,
the
complaint
is
devoid
of
any
specificity
effect.
all
we
see
are
conclusory
allegations.
i
am
intimidated
because
of
the
intimidation
statute.
now,
the
purported
foundation
for
this
case
lies
in
two
cases,
dombrowski
versus
pfister
and
zwickler
versus
koota
but
in
both
of
those
cases,
your
honors,
there
were
specificity
effects
at
least
in
dombrowski
there
were
affidavits
filed,
there
were
offers
of
proof
made
in
both
dombrowski
and
in
zwickler.
we
have
situations
where
there
were
prior
arrests
even
though
the
arrests
were
not
pending
at
the
time
of
the
federal
declaratory
relief.
and
lastly,
there
was
in
the
complaint
a
specific
contention
shown
by
the
defendants
to
future
arrest,
to
future
violation
of
the
plaintiffs'
constitutional
rights.
i
submit
that
this
case
does
not
fall
within
the
precept
of
dombrowski
and
zwickler
but
rather
falls
with
the
concept
of
dubois
versus
clark
and
the
recent
case
of
golden
versus
zwickler.
in
dubois,
this
court
declined
to
hear
a
situation
where
they
said
that
the
--
were
just
this
court
said
that
the
no
specificity
at
all
is
shown.
in
golden
versus
zwickler,
we
had
a
situation
where
the
court
stated
that
the
complaint
failed
to
present
probably
because
of
the
specificity
--
lack
of
specificity
of
the
complaint
fail
to
present
an
actual
case
or
controversy.
it
is
our
opinion
that
the
present
complaint
fails
both
to
shows
specificity
or
to
show
an
actual
case
or
controversy.
mr.
ronald
butler
yes.
well,
--
mr.
ronald
butler
we
don't
have
any
facts,
your
honor.
we
have
no
facts.
mr.
ronald
butler
we
have
to
go
back
to
the
complaint
itself
for
purpose
of
the
jurisdictional
argument,
yes.
we
would
be
in
the
same
situation
as
zwickler
versus
golden
before
this
court's
second
try.
mr.
ronald
butler
yes.
mr.
ronald
butler
that's
our
allegation,
--
mr.
ronald
butler
--
yes.
unless
this
court
is
prepared
to
allow
that
much
more
wide
of
latitude
than
it
seemed
that
the
intendment
of
dombrowski
was
designed
to
protect.
yes.
secondly,
as
to
the
issue
on
the
merits,
the
appellants
contend
that
a
statute
which
prohibits
threats
to
commit
a
criminal
offense
where
the
threats
are
intended
to
force
another,
to
surrender
their
freedom
of
choice
is
not
within
the
purview
of
the
first
amendment.
we
contend
this
upon
two
factors.
first,
in
analysis
of
the
thrust
of
the
statute;
and
secondly
the
scope
of
the
first
amendment
with
respect
to
threaten
conduct
where
the
intention
is
to
force
another
to
surrender
their
freedom
of
choice.
the
lower
court
in
this
case
in
a
very
fine
opinion
found
that
the
intimidation
statute
as
a
whole
was
designed
to
protect
communications
intended
to
compel
another
to
act
against
his
will.
the
court
defined
a
threat
then
and
they
said
a
threat
was
an
expression
of
an
intention
to
inflict
harm
or
evil
against
another.
they
said
that
it
was
more
than
a
mere
intention
however
that
it
was
a
menace
that
it
must
unsettle
the
mind
of
the
person
on
whom
it
operates
and
then
it
must
take
away
from
his
acts
that
free
and
voluntary
choice
which
would
alone
constitute
consent.
they
set
further
that
the
expression
of
that
threat
must
have
a
reasonable
tendency
to
be
carried
out
by
the
threatener
according
to
its
tenor.
this
is
the
definition
of
threat,
this
is
a
definition
we
abide
by
now
yet
when
the
lower
court
approach
to
sub-section
involved
it
shifted
its
emphasis
from
the
substantiality
of
the
threat
to
the
substantiality
of
the
crime.
this,
we
feel
is
what
precipitated
the
error
in
the
lower
court's
decision.
the
lower
court
itself
stated
earlier
that
the
substantiality
of
the
crime
was
not
really
the
important
thing
because
they
said
that
a
mere
expression
of
intent
to
commit
a
criminal
act
was
not
itself
sufficient
under
the
statute
that
we
need
the
final
element
of
extortion
which
completes
the
prohibited
act,
which
is
the
taking
away
of
that
free
and
voluntary
action
which
alone
constitutes
consent.
so
the
substantiality
of
the
evil
must
go
to
the
threat
and
to
the
fear
committed
by
that
threat
as
far
as
the
object
of
the
threat
is
concerned,
the
victim,
and
not
to
the
substantiality
or
the
insubstantiality
of
the
crime
threat.
the
court
made
three
illustrations
to
justify
proposed
--
their
proposed
opinion
and
the
three
illustrations
were
the
following:
a
group
of
dissidents
who
asked
for
certain
things
or
will
commit
disorderly
conduct,
people
in
a
high
crime
neighborhood
who
asked
for
more
police
protection
are
failing
to
get
a
threat
and
to
carry
conceal
weapons,
and
finally,
group
of
mothers
who
threatened
to
block
a
highway
should
they
not
get
a
traffic
regulatory
signal.
and
the
lower
court
was
of
the
opinion
that
since
those
crimes
that
they
threaten
was
so
insubstantial
when
measured
against
legitimate
political
discussion
on
a
wide
birth
that
the
first
amendment
should
then
protect
those
statements.
in
those
examples,
the
court
in
looking
to
the
crime
threat
failed
to
observe
the
main
purpose
in
spirit
of
the
statute
toward
the
person
threatened.
the
substantiality
of
the
threat
could
be
great
and
the
substantiality
of
the
crime
need
not
be
great,
need
be
insignificant
and
can
be
insignificant.
one
example
of
this
would
be
a
threat
by
an
individual
to
burn
two
pieces
of
lumber
placed
together
in
the
form
of
a
cross
in
an
open
field
next
to
a
school
which
is
to
be
integrated
the
next
day.
a
situation
involving
a
substantial
threat,
but
yet
of
an
insubstantial
crime.
a
further
example
individuals
on
a
campus
who
approach
the
chancellor
and
tell
the
chancellor
that
unless
their
demands
are
met
within
five
days,
that
they
are
going
to
disrupt
classes,
that
they
are
going
to
take
over
his
office,
they're
not
going
to
threaten
him
personally
or
physically,
they're
not
going
to
destroy
the
building
but
they're
just
going
to
make
it
impossible
for
the
school
to
function.
this
would
be
a
situation
where
the
threat
would
be
very
substantial
but
yet
the
crime
might
be
nothing
more
than
disorderly
conduct.
it
is
appellant's
contention
that
this
type
of
examples
along
with
the
example
cited
by
the
lower
court
which
fall
within
the
purview
in
concept
to
this
statute
and
that
the
statute
is
valid.
in
essence
then
with
the
lower
court
seems
to
be
saying
is
that
the
threat
of
an
insignificant
crime
when
they
said
that
the
threat
of
an
insignificant
crime
should
not
be
punished,
they
are
really
saying
that
a
little
bit
of
illegality
is
not
so
bad
and
can
be
protected
by
the
first
amendment
so
long
as
speech
is
involved.
in
examining
this
issue
in
the
light
of
first
amendment
protections,
it
doesn't
seem
to
meet
the
category
of
the
first
amendment
preserves.
an
extortion
by
threat
is
not
the
advocacy
of
ideas,
it's
not
the
teaching
of
ideas
and
it's
not
the
exposition
of
ideas.
it's
not
legitimate
political
discussion
on
a
wide
birth.
the
entire
history
of
the
cases
of
this
court
from
baldwin
versus
robertson
in
1896,
to
the
statement
made
in
carroll
versus
president
and
board
of
commissioners
of
saint
anne's
county
late
last
year
seem
to
indicate
that
speech
uttered
in
a
context
of
violence
or
speech
uttered
to
follow
an
illegal
course
of
conduct
are
not
prohibited
--
are
prohibited
rather
by
the
first
amendment.
the
first
amendment
should
not
protect
that
type
of
conduct.
and
on
our
brief
on
page
18
and
19,
we
have
set
forth
a
myriad
of
cases
respecting
this
point.
i
should
just
like
to
mention
a
few.
in
bridges
versus
california
where
this
court
a
contempt
case
where
this
court
reversed
the
contempt
conviction,
this
court
was
very
clear
to
point
out
that
under
no
construction
therefore
and
i'm
quoting
directly,
“under
no
construction
therefore,
can
we
take
the
telegram
of
bridges
to
be
a
threat
to
follow
an
illegal
course
of
conduct?”
in
chaplinsky
versus
new
hampshire
where
this
court
said
fighting
words
are
no
essential
part
of
any
exposition
of
ideas.
in
american
communications
versus
douds
where
the
majority
set
the
government
may
cutoff
a
speaker
only
when
his
views
are
no
longer
merely
views
but
threatened
clearly
and
imminently
to
ripen
into
conduct
into
which
the
public
has
a
right
to
protect.
and
even
roth
and
smith
in
the
concurring
and
dissenting
opinions,
the
dissenters
or
the
individuals
who
concurred
stated
that
freedom
of
expression
can
be
suppressed
if
and
to
the
extent,
it
is
so
closely
brigaded
with
illegal
action
as
to
be
an
inseparable
part
of
it.
your
honors,
the
approval
of
a
little
bit
of
illegality
constitutes
the
doctrine
of
permissive
lawlessness
which
this
court
has
never
sanctioned
and
which
i
hope
it
never
will.
how
can
we
allow
individuals
or
pressure
groups
to
exact
gain
from
others
based
upon
the
threat
to
commit
a
criminal
offense
and
at
the
same
time
maintain
that
we
lived
under
a
system
of
order,
under
a
system
where
first
amendment
rights
are
protected
under
a
system
or
individual
rights
are
first
and
foremost?
i
don't
think
we
could
live
with
the
opinion
of
the
lower
court
in
so
state.
in
conclusion,
the
effect
of
the
decision
of
the
lower
court
is
to
insulate
via
the
first
amendment
threatened
acts
which
force
other
individuals
to
surrender
their
freedom
of
choice.
the
statute
under
consideration
when
measured
by
the
scope
of
the
decisions
of
this
court
failed
to
transgress
upon
the
sanctity
of
free
expression
of
ideas,
since
the
protection
of
the
right
of
another
as
freedom
of
choice
stands
upon
as
equal
footing
as
the
right
of
the
speaker
to
say
it.
mr.
ronald
butler
yes,
sir.
mr.
ronald
butler
yes,
he
challenges,
yes.
did
you
ask
if
my
opponent
challenged
it,
your
honor?
mr.
ronald
butler
yes,
he
says
that
there
is
sufficient
standard.
mr.
ronald
butler
that's
correct.
no
one
was
--
mr.
ronald
butler
there's
an
allegation
--
yes,
there
is
an
allegation
that
they
were
threatened
but
it
is
our
contention
that
the
allegation
and
the
complaint
is
conclusion
only.
there
are
no
facts
to
support
that.
they
said
that
they
were
threatened,
yes.
mr.
ronald
butler
yes.
mr.
ronald
butler
that's
correct.
mr.
ronald
butler
that's
correct
although
later
on
they
then
restate
in
a
conclusory
fashion
that
they
are
intimidated
and
harassed
by
the
intimidation
statute,
yes.
mr.
ronald
butler
no.
mr.
ronald
butler
no,
they
don't
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
butler
that's
correct.
mr.
ronald
butler
they
alleged
that
they
feel
threatened,
yes.
that's
my
reading
of
the
complaint,
yes.
mr.
ronald
butler
yes.
mr.
ronald
butler
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
ronald
butler
i
think
it's
conclusory,
yes.
i
think
we
need
something
along
the
lines
of
dombrowski
in
the
sense
of
when
and
how
and
where,
how
did
this
happen,
can
you
just
say
that
i
have
been
intimidated?
mr.
ronald
butler
i
think
there
are
many
demonstrations
that
one
could
engage
in
and
still
live
with
the
statute,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
butler
maybe
i
didn't
understand.
mr.
ronald
butler
i
think
it
is,
yes.
i
think
it's
quite
general.
mr.
ronald
butler
no,
i
think
it
would
be
--
i
think
it
would
be
more
valid
to
say
that
we
were
going
to
involve
ourselves
in
the
demonstration
that
we
have
been
specifically
harassed
by
police
officers
--
mr.
ronald
butler
i
would
think
that
there
should
be,
yes.
yes.
mr.
ronald
butler
some
allegation
of
it,
yes.
mr.
ronald
butler
yes,
this
is
the
only
statute
with
its
seven
sub
points,
one
of
which
is
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
ronald
butler
well,
they
--
no,
no,
no.
well,
they
said
it
was
maybe
that's
true
but
the
basis
of
it
is
it
violates
the
fourteenth
amendment
because
it's
overbroad
because
it
sweeps
unnecessary
broadly
over
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
ronald
butler
yes,
absolutely
with
respect
to
sub-section
(a)
(3),
yes.
mr.
ronald
butler
which
is
the
only
sub-section
on
appeal
before
this
court,
yes,
but
the
--
mr.
ronald
butler
i
couldn't
believe
that
that's
true
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
butler
that
would
be
correct,
yes.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
butler
that's
correct.
it
would
have
to
come
under
one
of
the
other
sections
and
may
i
state
to
the
court
that
there
are
other
specifically
enumerated
crimes
such
as
bribery,
perjury,
theft,
pass
of
anything
which
conspires
concealed
weapons
are
concerned
which
be
within
the
confines
of
sub-section
(a)
(3)
but
not
within
the
confines
of
sub-sections
(1),
(2),
(4),
(5),
(6)
and
(7)
which
would
fall
as
well
along
with
this
legitimate
political
discussion.
mr.
ronald
butler
i
believe
so,
your
honor.
i
think
the
legislature
try
to
make
specific
wherever
they
can
and
each
of
the
sub-sections
and
then
they
put
in
the
final
section
which
still
was
narrow
limited
to
the
prevention
of
threats
to
commit
a
crime
and
still
take
in
the
areas
which
were
not
covered
by
the
other
sub-sections.
mr.
ronald
butler
no,
not
against
the
extortion,
your
honor.
we
have
the
specific
criminal
sections
when
the
act
is
completed
as
far
as
the
extortion
is
concerned
--
mr.
ronald
butler
except
for
section
33
(3)
which
have
to
do
with
extortion
by
public
officials
which
is
the
old
common
law
extortion.
that's
the
only
other
extortion
intimidation
statute
we
have,
yes.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
butler
several
short
points
on
rebuttal,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
butler
first
of
all
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
white's
question
with
respect
to
the
pleadings
on
page
30
of
the
appendix,
first
point
under
the
motion
to
dismiss
is
that
this
court
has
no
jurisdiction
and
it's
been
re-alleged
--
mr.
ronald
butler
it
was
argued
in
the
context
of
case
of
controversy
and
the
memorandum
that
was
filed,
yes
which
is
not
a
part
of
the
appendix.
mr.
ronald
butler
he
dealt
with
in
the
context
of
dombrowski
generally,
your
honor
where
there
is
a
statement
i
believe
on
page
487
of
dombrowski
which
said
that
the
minimum
requirements
of
standing
i
have
been
lessen
and
the
court
--
the
three-judge
court
on
page
64
of
the
appendix
footnotes
25
and
26
repeated
that
statement
and
in
the
manner
and
which
seem
to
indicate
that
the
standing
requirement
was
lessened.
mr.
ronald
butler
yes,
i
believe
and
i'll
furnish
to
him.
i
believe
he
tried
to
attribute
it
toward
the
declaratory
judgment
face
not
the
injunctive
face.
i
think
he
is
--
mr.
ronald
butler
well,
no.
well,
maybe
not
in
the
opinion
i
mean
probably
not
in
the
record
but
i
was
cognizant
at
least
--
mr.
ronald
butler
no,
that's
--
mr.
ronald
butler
that's
correct
but
we
must
remember
that
zwickler
versus
koota
had
been
decided
at
the
time
of
this
and
he
was
cognizant
though
but
although
it
doesn't
appear.
also
as
far
as
paragraph
34
is
concern,
your
honor,
i
see
no
different
between
the
allegations
which
i
can
contend
that
conclusory
in
that
respect
or
in
a
civil
case
where
i
state
that
some
else
was
negligent
and
someone
else
committed
it
toward
against
me.
i
think
that's
conclusory,
i
don't
think
that
has
any
kind
of
even
quasi-specificity
and
i
think
i
could
take
paragraph
34
and
i've
as
have
been
pointed
out
by
one
of
the
justices
earlier
and
include
every
single
state
of
illinois
criminal
statute
in
paragraph
34
because
all
i
have
to
say
that
i'm
in
fear.
mr.
ronald
butler
well,
i
think
that's
the
same
allegation
could
be
made.
the
defendants
have
threatened
to
use
every
single
statute.
mr.
ronald
butler
i
think
so,
yes.
because
a
motion
to
dismiss
admits
all
well
pleaded
allegations
but
the
question
is
whether
that's
well
pleaded.
mr.
ronald
butler
no,
i
would
admit
only
well
pleaded
allegations
and
something
says
i've
been
threaten,
it's
the
same
of
saying
i've
had
it
toward
committed
against
me.
mr.
ronald
butler
someone
has
been
negligent.
mr.
ronald
butler
when
someone
says
a
defendant
is
threatened,
that's
a
conclusion.
how
did
the
threat
come
above?
that's
a
conclusion
based
upon
something
else
with
something
else
is
not
involved
here.
mr.
ronald
butler
i
respectfully
disagree
with
as
far
as
that's
concern.
i
think
it's
not.
mr.
ronald
butler
i
think
a
conclusion
is
something
that's
based
upon
series
of
other
statements.
i
can't
say
that
i
committed
a
negligent
act
against
you
and
have
a
complaint
with
stand
and
motion
to
dismiss.
i
can
say
that
you
injured
me
as
far
as
certain
time
and
place
in
automobile
when
you
went
into
the
back
of
my
automobile.
i
could
make
a
conclusion
from
the
basis
of
those
statements
but
i
can't
just
make
the
statement
and
expect
to
withstand
a
motion
to
dismiss.
mr.
ronald
butler
no,
i
have
no
cases
your
honor.
i
--
mr.
ronald
butler
no,
i've
been
--
dombrowski
and
zwickler
and
the
rest
of
the
cases
have
been
quite
difficult
and
up
until
golden
versus
zwickler
was
taken,
i
didn't
know
myself
whether
standing
argument
would
be
sufficient
in
this
case.
mr.
ronald
butler
i
think
there
would
have
to
be
something
more
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
butler
like
time,
like
place
--
mr.
ronald
butler
well,
--
mr.
ronald
butler
it
can,
yes.
it
can
be
over
this
time.
mr.
ronald
butler
no,
i'm
not
running
away
from
it,
your
honor.
i'm
not
running
away
from
it
at
all.
the
answer
was
filed,
there
was
a
denial.
