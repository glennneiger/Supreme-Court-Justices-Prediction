chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
hear
the
arguments
in
number
6,
boyle
against
landry.
mr.
bilton,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
was
a
declaratory
judgment
in
the
broadest
advisory
sense,
was
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
kidnapping
with
a
demand
for
ransom
come
under
the
statute?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or
"give
me
your
money
because
i
have
your
child."
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
because
this
overlap
with
the
kidnapping
statutes?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so,
are
you
saying
that
the
insubstantiality
of
the
criminal
act
threaten
is
irrelevant?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
could
a
threat
be
brought
within
the
statute
by
the
innuendo,
the
implications
or
reasonable
implications
to
be
drown
from
the
threat?
i
recall
for
example,
the
cases
back
20
some
years
ago
in
new
york
where
the
practice
of
the
extortion
in
brooklyn
i
think
it
was,
was
to
go
to
storekeeper
and
say,
you
pay
us
$25.00
a
week
or
you
won't
be
able
to
get
play
plus
insurance
anymore.?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
the
innuendo
there
was
indirect
that
you
won't
be
able
to
get
the
play
plus
insurance
because
there
will
be
so
much
breakage
that
no
one
will
ensure
you,
that
was
found
to
be
something
on
which
this
conviction
could
be
sustained.
would
it
be
sustained
under
the
illinois
statute?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
the
statute
would
not
be
over
broad
in
your
view
because
it
permits
proof
of
the
innuendo?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
go
back
to
your
responds
to
mr.
justice
stewart's
question
if
by
whatever
process
it
is
determined
that
the
injunction
that
there
was
no
jurisdiction
issue
an
injunction
here
in
the
three-judge
court
then,
there
is
nothing
here
on
the
declaratory
judgment
because
that
would
not
be
here,
would
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
they
know
you
can't
get
a
three-judge
court
for
declaratory
judgment
standing
alone,
can
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
can't
get
a
three-judge
court
case
for
a
declaratory
judgment
alone?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so,
that
the
injunction
falls
everything
falls
with
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
bilton.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
reid.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
counsel,
how
do
we
know
these
facts
mr.
reid,
where
do
they
appeared
in
this
record?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
is
it
that
you
want
us
to
do
with
respect
to
this
statute
today?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
what
is
there
in
this
record
that
tells
us
that
people
get
beat
over
the
head,
at
least
for
picketing,
in
this
record
counsel?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
will
be
more
helpful
to
the
court
mr.
reid
if
you
keep
your
factual
development
within
the
records,
so
that
we
know
that
you're
talking
about
this
case
and
not
some
other
hypothetical
case.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
does
this
record
show,
does
this
record
tell
us
somewhere
that
the
people
in
this
class
had
been
arrested
at
some
time?
is
that
by
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
is
that
an
allegation
of
the
complaint
or
it's
the
evidence?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
it
denied?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
don't
want
to
hold
you
up
now
you
might
--
chief
justice

chief

that
the
normal
course
of
litigation
in
the
whole
general
scheme
of
things?.
chief
