mr.
dean
h.
bilton
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
from
the
entry
of
interlocutory
injunction
by
a
three-judge
court
after
that
three-judge
court
found
one
subsection
of
the
illinois
intimidation
statute
unconstitutional
on
its
face.
that
court
said
that
the
statue
was
over
broad.
the
statute
is
part
of
the
illinois
criminal
code,
chapter
38,
section
12-6
(a)
(3)
and
it's
a
rather
short
statute
and
may
i
just
read
it
to
you.
it
says
that
a
person
commits
intimidation
when
with
the
intent
to
cause
another
to
perform
or
to
omit
the
performance
of
any
act,
he
communicates
to
another
a
threat
to
perform
without
lawful
authority
any
of
the
following
acts,
and
the
part
that
we
are
involved
with
today
is
a
threat
to
commit
any
criminal
offense.
i
was
quite
shocked
this
morning
when
i
opened
up
the
washington
post
and
found
out
that
this
was
supposed
to
be
a
case
that
dealt
with
violence
and
some
kind
of
mob
action
and
for
a
year
and
so
in
the
law
week
they
ascribe
this
is
some
kind
of
a
statute
that
prohibits
threats.
this
statute
does
not
prohibit
threats,
it
is
not
a
public
order
statute.
this
statute
is
a
crime
against
a
person
and
it's
so
codified
in
illinois.
this
is
an
extortion
statute,
an
extortion
is
a
robbery.
the
only
difference
between
extortion
and
robbery
--
robbery
is,
"give
me
your
money
or
i'll
do
something
to
you
right
now"
and
extortion
is,
"give
me
your
money
or
i'll
do
something
to
you
in
a
short
while
or
a
little
bit
later."
and
i
see
that
this
morning
we
are
joined
here
with
the
younger
case
which
is
the
criminal
syndicalism
case
and
the
samuels'
case
and
fernando's,
all
of
them
involving
anarchy
and
public
order.
the
gun
case
coming
up
tomorrow
is
disorderly
conduct
case,
dyson
and
karalexis
are
obscenity
cases.
this
case
is
quite,
quite
different.
this
is
a
crime
against
a
person
and
the
object
of
protection
here
is
the
person
and
his
right
to
keep
his
money
in
his
pocket
and
we
think
that
threats
to
take
that
man's
money
away
or
threats
being
used
as
weapons
to
remove
that
money
are
never
considered
free
speech
and
for
that
reason
of
course,
we
feel
that
very
initially
this
statute
is
just
not
unconstitutional,
it's
being
a
violation
of
the
first
amendment.
we
may
have
misled
this
court
in
reaching
these
conclusions
about
this
being
a
statute
that
prohibits
threats
when
we
set
out
our
question
presented
on
page
4
of
our
brief.
our
question
presented
said
that
this
statute
is
an
extortion
statute
that
deals
with
threats
to
commit
crimes.
a
more
accurate
statement
would
be
that
this
was
a
statute
that
prohibits
one
from
taking
or
attempting
to
take
the
property
or
to
protect
the
rights
of
another
through
the
use
of
threats
to
commit
crimes.
and
we
think
it's
in
that
light
that
this
statute
ought
be
viewed.
the
very
first
issue
in
this
case
is
one
of
standing.
the
plaintiffs
here
were
seven
subclasses
of
black
people
in
chicago,
all
claiming
to
be
black
activists
and
all
under
certain
pending
state
charges
and
the
defendants
here
were
all,
who
are
the
appellants
in
this
case,
all
members
of
the
official
dome
of
the
city
of
chicago
in
the
county
of
cook
who
were
charged
with
the
prosecution
of
the
appellees.
none
of
the
appellees
were
charged
with
this
intimidation
statute
at
anytime
and
there
are
no
pending
state
charges
against
the
appellees.
the
appellees
in
their
complaint
stated
that
all
the
statutes
involved
and
there
were
five
of
them
including
violence,
resisting
arrest,
aggravated
assault,
aggravated
battery
and
intimidation
were
all
being
used
by
the
defendants
in
furtherance
of
a
bad-faith
conspiracy
to
keep
these
appellees
from
exercising
their
first
amendment
rights
and
they
used
the
dombrowski
allegations
of
a
chilling
effect
and
bad-faith
conspiracy
and
they
say
these
words.
there
was
an
answer
filed
denying
the
existence
of
this
conspiracy
and
a
three-judge
court
sat
and
heard
the
threshold
question
of
the
constitutionality
of
this
statute
on
its
face.
by
the
way,
there
never
has
been
a
trial
and
onto
the
merits
of
this
complaint
there
has
be
no
proof
of
any
bad-faith
conspiracy
existing
among
these
appellants,
defendants
below
to
do
the
acts
of
which
they
were
accused
in
the
complaint.
mr.
dean
h.
bilton
the
three-judge
court
issued
a
declaratory
judgment
and
then
it
issued
pursuant
to
that
declaration
that
this
subsection
of
the
intimidation
act
was
unconstitutional.
it
then
issued
a
blanket
injunction
stopping
state
attorney's
office
of
cook
county
for
prosecuting
anybody
under
this
particular
intimidation
subsection.
it
didn't
--
mr.
dean
h.
bilton
right,
there
are
never
was
any
prosecution
of
any
plaintiff
here
under
the
section
at
all.
mr.
dean
h.
bilton
in
a
very
pure
broad
abstract
sense,
that's
correct.
by
the
way
the
one
subsection
of
the
intimidation
said
statute
that
was
said
out
in
the
complaint
was
a
section
that
refers
to
intimidation
by
public
officials.
it
wouldn't
have
applied
to
the
plaintiff's
at
all.
it
was
intimidations
by
a
public
official
in
withholding
his
own
action
or
doing
something
that
he
shouldn't
have
done.
so
truly,
when
we
went
to
our
hearing
before
the
three-judge
court,
no
one
under
--
really
understood
what
was
the
problem
with
the
intimidation
statute?
it
wasn't
until
after
the
three-judge
court
opinion
that
we
find
out
and
discover
that
the
court
thought
that
this
one
subsection
is
over
broad.
now,
looking
at
standing,
the
court
said
that
the
plaintiffs
had
standing
because
they
were
not
charged
with
any
of
the
offenses
here
and
that
therefore
they
came
under
the
right
of
the
dombrowski
case
and
the
zwickler
case
to
give
such
people
declaratory
judgments
when
they
claim
that
their
first
amendment
rights
are
being
infringed
upon.
we
submit
to
this
court
that
both
dombrowski
and
zwickler
are
quite
distinguishable.
in
both
dombrowski
and
zwickler,
the
plaintiffs
there
had
a
history
in
louisiana
and
in
new
york
of
having
the
statutes
that
they
complained
about
being
used
against
them.
mr.
dombrowski
held
up
his
organization
in
louisiana
and
he
was
arrested
and
he
was
charged
with
violating
a
louisiana
sedition
statute
and
then
a
motion
of
quash
stopped
that
prosecution
against
mr.
dombrowski.
he
then
went
into
the
federal
district
court
and
sought
relief
to
stop
future
prosecutions
under
that
over
broad
statute.
so,
we
had
a
history
of
facts
that
he
could
point
to
and
said,
"look,
are
they
going
to
do
that
to
me
again."
and
in
fact,
the
state
of
louisiana
(inaudible)
mr.
dombrowski
by
rating
him
shortly
after
he
filed
his
complaint
in
the
district
court
and
indicted
him
for
the
sedition
statute.
and
in
zwickler
case,
a
new
york
man
who
was
distributing
handbills
anonymously,
he
was
arrested
and
he
was
found
guilty
under
a
new
york
statute
that
said,
"you
can't
distribute
election
campaign
literature
anonymously
in
quantity."
his
conviction
was
later
overturned
by
the
new
york
supreme
court
on
the
criminal
elements
but
didn't
reach
the
constitutional
points.
zwickler,
then
went
to
the
us
district
court,
filed
his
complaint
for
declaratory
judgment
and
said,
"i'm
going
to
do
the
same
thing
in
the
next
election
and
they're
going
to
apply
the
statute
to
me
again
in
the
next
election."
so,
he
too
had
some
facts
that
he
could
point
to
justify
his
conclusions
that
the
state
was
going
to
apply
this
over
broad
statute
against
him.
now,
in
our
case
none
of
the
15
or
so
named
plaintiffs
nor
the
organization
act
or
any
of
the
plaintiffs
that
joined
in
later
on
or
ever
were
charged
with
this
intimidation
statute.
they
didn't
even
set
it
out
in
their
complaint.
so,
we
don't
believe
that
a
person
has
the
right
to
come
in
to
the
district
court
and
to
say
the
magic
words,
to
say
that
my
first
amendment
rights
are
being
chilled
and
that
gives
him
an
automatic
right
to
get
a
declaratory
judgment
of
any
statute
that
he
still
chooses
and
that's
what
happened
in
this
case.
so,
for
those
reasons
we
do
not
believe
that
the
plaintiffs
here
in
the
first
place
had
standing
to
challenge
the
act
that
they
did.
i
will
admit
however
that
both
dombrowski
and
zwickler
do
give
the
federal
courts
jurisdiction
to
sit
in
declaratory
judgments
when
a
person
is
not
charged
with
a
pending
state
case.
now,
looking
at
the
statute
itself
or
on
its
merits,
we
do
not
believe
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
and
our
brief
from
pages
13
to
page
20,
we
have
a
compilation
of
the
first
amendment
cases
as
best
we
could
and
we
drew
two
conclusions
and
that
is
one,
that
first
amendment
cases
are
treated
on
a
case
by
case
basis.
the
rule
of
law
seems
to
be
that
to
balance
the
interest
of
the
speaker
against
whatever
state
interest
is
involved.
well,
in
this
statute
the
interest
of
the
speaker
is
that
of
a
thief.
he
is
attempting
to
take
something
from
another
person
by
the
use
of
threats
and
the
protected
interest
involved
is
the
states'
right
to
protect
individuals
in
their
person
and
in
their
safety
and
in
their
possessions.
we
don't
think
there's
any
--
there's
no
contest
here.
on
those
--
on
that
test
alone,
the
statute
should
be
considered
a
valid
exercise
of
the
states'
power
and
not
over
broad
statute.
i
believe
that
the
three-judge
court
misunderstood
the
statute
because
it
said
that
the
statute
was
over
broad
because
it
prohibited
threats
of
insubstantial
evil.
well,
this
is
incorrect
in
two
ways.
first
of
all,
the
statute
doesn't
prohibit
threats.
it
prohibits
extortion
by
threats,
it
prohibits
robbery
by
threats,
but
it
doesn't
prohibit
threats
in
the
abstract.
people
can
get
up
and
speak
about
advocating
crime.
they
can
get
up
and
threaten
all
they
want.
if
there
is
no
extortion
element
present,
this
statute
doesn't
prohibit
that
kind
of
conduct.
mr.
dean
h.
bilton
"give
me
your
money
or
i
will
commit
a
kidnapping,"
yes.
mr.
dean
h.
bilton
well,
give
me
your
money
because
--
mr.
dean
h.
bilton
it
probably
be
--
in
that
sense,
it
probably
would
overlap
with
kidnapping
and
certainly
overlaps
with
robbery
because
it's
at
the
same
kind
of
statute
depending
how
close
the
intimidating
factor
is.
if
i
hold
a
gun
in
your
head
and
say,
"give
me
your
money
or
i'll
kill
you
in
five
minutes,"
i
might
be
committing
extortion
or
i
might
be
committing
robbery,
depending
on
whether
or
not
the
incidence
of
violence
is
immediate
or
delayed.
extortion
is
that
statute
which
picks
up
where
robbery
leaves
off.
yes,
i
believe
that
there
is
an
overlapping
here
with
other
state
statutes.
secondly,
that
the
court
in
that
one
statement
about
the
statute
prohibiting
threats
of
insubstantial
evil,
this
idea
of
insubstantial
evil
was
a
question
that
even
victim
has
to
answer.
what
might
be
a
very
small
weapon
to
a
court
might
be
a
very
major
weapon
to
the
victim.
so,
when
the
court
said
that
there
are
little
crimes
which
might
not
be
too
scary
to
a
person
they
did
not
--
the
court
didn't
place
itself
in
the
shoes
of
that
victim.
he
might
be
just
the
kind
of
a
person
that
would
be
intimidated
by
a
small
offense.
now,
the
point
that
the
court
i
believe
did
loss
sight
of
the
object
of
the
protection
of
the
statute
and
thought
that
this
was
a
public
order
statute,
i'd
like
to
just
point
to
the
opinion
that's
set
out
in
page
94
of
our
appendix
and
may
i
just
read
these
two
sentences
here
or
three
sentences.
the
court
said,
"indeed,
the
phrase,
commit
any
criminal
offense
is
so
broad
as
to
include
threats
to
commit
misdemeanors
punishable
by
fine
only.
these
evils
are
not
so
substantial
that
the
state's
interest
in
prohibiting
the
threat
of
them
outweighs
the
public
interest
in
giving
legitimate
political
discussion
a
wide
birth.
since
the
language
of
subparagraph
a
(3)
is
an
over
broad
restriction
and
the
freedom
of
speech
is
invalid,
obviously
however,
if
the
threat
is
carried
out,
the
persons
who
violate
the
criminal
law
by
their
acts
are
subject
to
punishment."
well,
this
notion
that
it
is
better
to
let
man
threaten
and
speak
to
preserve
the
first
amendment
and
then
arrest
him
when
he
commits
action
is
a
good
notion
for
statutes
that
protect
public
order,
but
if
i
say
to
you,
"give
me
your
money
or
i
will
break
your
windows
later
on"
and
you
give
me
your
money,
i
never
carry
out
the
threat.
so,
the
action
here,
the
threat
here
is
a
weapon
and
the
weapon
--
mr.
dean
h.
bilton
of
course,
just
as
the
caliber
of
the
weapon
used
in
a
robbery
is
irrelevant.
i
presume
you
could
commit
a
robbery
with
a
gun
or
a
pea
shooter.
the
pea
shooter
doesn't
seem
to
be
very
dangerous,
but
when
held
up
next
to
someone's
eye
might
be
just
enough
to
make
the
man
part
with
his
wallet
and
you
can
commit
a
robbery
by
not
pulling
the
trigger
of
the
gun.
you
can
hold
the
gun
and
say,
"here
i
have
a
gun,
give
me
your
money."
you
pay
the
man
your
money
and
he
does
not
shoot
you.
so,
this
notion
in
first
amendment
cases
that
we
can
wait
until
the
threat
or
act
doesn't
apply
to
cases
involved
in
protection
of
the
individual
because
--
mr.
dean
h.
bilton
oh!
yes,
it
has
a
chilling
effect
on
the
victim,
yes
[attempt
to
laughter].
so,
for
that
reason
we
believed
that
court
was
misconstruing
this
statute
in
such
away
so
that
that
they
believe
it
was
a
public
order
statute.
when
i
talked
about
legitimate
political
discussion
to
this
day,
i
fail
to
see
how
intimidating
a
person
to
either
take
his
vote
by
threatening
crimes
against
him
or
intimidating
a
public
official
by
taking
away
his
freedom
of
speech
by
threatening
crimes
against
him
can
be
considered
legitimate
political
discussion.
telling
a
congressman,
mr.
congressman
vote
for
my
program
or
advocate
my
program
or
i
will
commit
an
act
of
violence
or
i
will
kill
you.
this
certainly
is
pretty
powerful
lobbying
and
i
don't
believe
that
this
ought
to
be
protected
free
speech.
the
court
said
in
holding
the
statute
unconstitutional
that
the
statute
was
not
vague,
but
it
was
over
broad
because
it
had
little
crimes
included
in
the
threats
of
the
criminal
conduct.
the
definition
of
what
is
and
what
is
not
over
broad
was
set
out
by
this
court
in
the
zwickler
case
and
this
court
said
that
over
breadth
is
that
which
is
the
constitutional
principle
that
a
governmental
purpose
to
control
or
prevent
activities
causing
subject
to
state
regulation
may
not
be
achieved
by
means
where
a
sweep
unnecessarily
broadly
and
thereby
invade
the
area
of
protected
freedoms.
there
seems
to
be
two
factors
in
this
concept
of
over
breath;
one
is
this
wide
sweep
and
one
is
the
invasion
of
the
area
of
protected
freedoms.
initially,
we
do
not
think
that
the
thief
has
any
protected
freedom
to
try
to
take
property
from
another
by
threatening
crimes.
an
as
far
as
this
wide
sweep
is
concerns,
we
have
said
out
in
our
brief
a
comparison
of
this
statute
with
the
federal
extortion
statutes
and
all
the
state
extortion
statutes.
mr.
dean
h.
bilton
it
does
not
violate
this
section.
mr.
dean
h.
bilton
i'll
see
to
it
that
you
get
no
more
profits
is
not
a
crime
(voice
overlaps)
--
mr.
dean
h.
bilton
but
you
didn't
include
that
last
factor
of
committing
a
crime.
your
first
example
mr.
justice
marshall,
you
said
that
if
you
do
not
hire
more
negroes
we
will
see
to
it
that
you
receive
no
more
profits.
they
might
boycott
the
store,
people
might
not
shop
there,
that
isn't
a
commission
of
a
crime
in
illinois.
mr.
dean
h.
bilton
well,
if
those
--
i
believe
you're
trying
to
drive
that
those
words
being
threatening
words
to
commit
a
physical
violence
on
the
man.
subtly,
are
you
going
to
be
making
that
subtly,
they
are
saying,
"either
you
hire
negroes
or
we
will
hurt
you,"
but
they
are
saying
that
suddenly.
mr.
dean
h.
bilton
it's
not
covered
by
this
section
because
this
section
only
prohibits
threats
that
commit
crimes
and
since
there
is
no
threat
there
to
commit
a
crime
it
would
not
be
covered
by
this
section.
mr.
dean
h.
bilton
well,
i
don't
think
it's
a
crime
in
illinois
to
put
another
man
out
of
business
legally.
[attempt
to
laughter]
mr.
dean
h.
bilton
that's
correct.
mr.
dean
h.
bilton
that's
correct.
mr.
dean
h.
bilton
it
would
not
come
on
the
stage.
mr.
dean
h.
bilton
that's
correct!
absolutely
correct!
the
threat
here
must
be
a
threat
to
commit
a
crime
and
that
was
a
section
that
was
held
to
be
over
broad.
mr.
dean
h.
bilton
yes,
this
--
mr.
dean
h.
bilton
yes,
it
would.
the
only
problem
there
is
a
problem
of
the
prosecutor
proving
up
all
the
elements
of
this
crime
beyond
unreasonable
doubt.
so,
he
must
convince
that
jury
that
the
words
used
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
carry
that
innuendo
to
have
violence
connected
with
this
threat.
it's
true,
it
would
cover
direct
threats
and
threats
by
innuendo.
we
deal
there
though
with
problems
of
proof
rather
than
the
abstract
cases
that
we
have
here.
mr.
dean
h.
bilton
no.
no,
in
that
regard
it
--
in
a
sense
with
every
other
extortion
statute
in
this
country
you
need
not
tell
a
man
directly
that
you
intend
to
do
him
violence
if
he
gets
the
message
by
innuendo.
what
we're
trying
to
protect
is
people
from
being
relieved
of
their
possessions
if
by
force
or
by
coercion.
now
we
have
set
forth
a
comparison
in
our
brief
of
relevant
federal
statutes
including
the
hubs
act
and
other
state
statutes
involving
extortion
and
we
believe
that
our
statute
in
illinois
is
far
narrower
than
those
acts
which
committed
extortion
under
the
hubs
act.
i
direct
your
honors'
attention
to
nick
versus
the
united
states
and
us
versus
campagna,
both
cited
in
our
brief
where
a
person
committed
extortion
by
threatening
the
movie
industry
to
pull
out
the
projection
list
unless
he
received
an
illegal
payoff.
well,
here
the
act
threatened
were
just
to
commit
a
tort
or
to
commit
an
unfair
labor
of
practice,
an
illegal
strike.
in
illinois,
of
course
we
prohibit
threats
of
crimes
and
to
do
a
crime
is
do
something
which
is
far
more
narrower
in
scope
than
to
commit
torts.
or
they
have
said
out
the
communications
act
in
the
federal
government
which
prohibits
extortion
by
telephoning
a
person
and
injuring
the
reputation,
threatening
to
injure
reputation
of
the
person
or
another
person
either
living
or
deceased
which
is
certainly
far
broader
in
scope
in
the
illinois
statute
here.
mr.
dean
h.
bilton
well,
if
i
prevail
on
my
dombrowski
point
that's
true.
we're
left
then
in
the
illinois
with
unconstitutional
declaration
of
a
statute
with
the
case
reversed
on
other
grounds.
our
statute
as
it
sits
right
now,
it
has
been
declared
by
a
three-judge
court
to
be
unconstitutional.
in
all
honesty,
mr.
zwickler
was
not
under
a
pending
state
charge
when
he
went
into
the
court
and
neither
was
mr.
dombrowski
and
for
that
reason
the
district
court
in
illinois
knowing
full
well
that
these
people
were
not
charged
with
the
statute
but
seeing
their
complaint
where
they
said
that
they
were
threatened
by
the
application
of
the
statute
by
a
bad
faith
conspiracy
said
that
they're
still
in
the
same
position
that
mr.
zwickler
did.
mr.
dean
h.
bilton
that's
correct.
mr.
dean
h.
bilton
i
agree,
yes.
mr.
dean
h.
bilton
well,
the
opinion
on
the
declaratory
feature
of
course
for
all
practical
purposes
takes
away
this
particular
statute
from
using
illinois.
it
is
however
amiable
statute,
we
have
several
other
sections
and
we're
not
completely
devoid
of
an
extortion
law
in
illinois.
but
this
is
a
very
important
section
though
because
it
is
the
one
that
allows
us
to
cope
with
new
and
inventive
crooks.
the
other
subsections
are
ones
that
are
the
traditional
extortion
elements,
the
blackmail
elements,
the
threats
in
the
reputations.
this
section
is
the
one
that
allows
us
not
to
sit
back
and
let
a
person
commit
extortion
that
isn't
covered
by
the
other
section
and
if
he
commits,
if
he
threatens
a
crime
then
we
move
in.
mr.
dean
h.
bilton
well,
if
this
court
did
rule
that
the
appellants
--
appellees
had
no
standing
to
bring
their
complaint
to
the
district
court
--
mr.
dean
h.
bilton
i
beg
your
pardon,
i
didn't
quite
understand.
mr.
dean
h.
bilton
no,
you
have
to
seek
injunction
which
every
declaratory
judgment
does,
seeks
the
injunction.
mr.
dean
h.
bilton
well,
if
the
standing
to
bring
the
case
to
court
falls
everything
seems
to
fall
with
it,
but
for
the
fact
that
there
are
other
people
who
will
do
the
same
thing
again
and
might
be
charged
with
intimidation
and
we're
back
again
to
where
we
started,
trying
to
support
statute
that's
alleged
to
be
over
broad
and
we
have
holding
in
illinois
that
the
statute
is
over
broad
and
the
case
was
first
on
the
grounds.
it
would
not
help
the
appellants
in
this
case
at
all.
getting
back
to
our
comparison,
we
did
compare
this
statute
with
all
the
other
states.
we
found
40
other
states
having
broader
threats
than
ours
do
and
especially
states
such
as
utah
which
prohibit
coercion
or
extortion
by
threats
of
any
nature.
we
think
our
statute
is
quite
narrowly
drawn
when
compared
to
the
statutes
in
the
rest
of
the
states
and
the
statutes
of
the
federal
government.
whatever
time
i
have
left,
i'd
like
to
reserve
for
rebuttal.
thank
you.
mr.
dean
h.
bilton
i
only
wish
to
rebut
one
statement.
mr.
reid
just
said
that
in
illinois
you
can
threaten
to
commit
a
disorderly
conduct
and
wind
up
in
prison
for
five
years.
you
can
only
do
that
in
illinois
if
you
threaten
to
commit
disorderly
conduct
while
you
are
attempting
to
steal
from
a
person
or
while
you
are
attempting
to
rob
from
a
person
or
why
you
are
attempting
to
extort
something
from
that
person.
threats
of
disorderly
conduct
in
the
abstract
are
not
prohibited
by
this
statute
or
whatsoever
because
this
is
not
a
public
order
statute,
this
is
the
statute
which
protects
the
person.
other
than
that
i
think
that
my
argument
in
chief
covered
all
the
points
that
mr.
reid
talked
about
and
i
have
no
further
rebuttal
but
just
to
respectfully
request
this
court
to
reverse
the
three-judge
court
below
and
restore
the
illinois
statute
that
we
feel
is
very
important
in
our
scheme
about
criminal
code.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
dean
h.
bilton
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
from
the
entry
of
interlocutory
injunction
by
a
three-judge
court
after
that
three-judge
court
found
one
subsection
of
the
illinois
intimidation
statute
unconstitutional
on
its
face.
that
court
said
that
the
statue
was
over
broad.
the
statute
is
part
of
the
illinois
criminal
code,
chapter
38,
section
12-6
(a)
(3)
and
it's
a
rather
short
statute
and
may
i
just
read
it
to
you.
it
says
that
a
person
commits
intimidation
when
with
the
intent
to
cause
another
to
perform
or
to
omit
the
performance
of
any
act,
he
communicates
to
another
a
threat
to
perform
without
lawful
authority
any
of
the
following
acts,
and
the
part
that
we
are
involved
with
today
is
a
threat
to
commit
any
criminal
offense.
i
was
quite
shocked
this
morning
when
i
opened
up
the
washington
post
and
found
out
that
this
was
supposed
to
be
a
case
that
dealt
with
violence
and
some
kind
of
mob
action
and
for
a
year
and
so
in
the
law
week
they
ascribe
this
is
some
kind
of
a
statute
that
prohibits
threats.
this
statute
does
not
prohibit
threats,
it
is
not
a
public
order
statute.
this
statute
is
a
crime
against
a
person
and
it's
so
codified
in
illinois.
this
is
an
extortion
statute,
an
extortion
is
a
robbery.
the
only
difference
between
extortion
and
robbery
--
robbery
is,
"give
me
your
money
or
i'll
do
something
to
you
right
now"
and
extortion
is,
"give
me
your
money
or
i'll
do
something
to
you
in
a
short
while
or
a
little
bit
later."
and
i
see
that
this
morning
we
are
joined
here
with
the
younger
case
which
is
the
criminal
syndicalism
case
and
the
samuels'
case
and
fernando's,
all
of
them
involving
anarchy
and
public
order.
the
gun
case
coming
up
tomorrow
is
disorderly
conduct
case,
dyson
and
karalexis
are
obscenity
cases.
this
case
is
quite,
quite
different.
this
is
a
crime
against
a
person
and
the
object
of
protection
here
is
the
person
and
his
right
to
keep
his
money
in
his
pocket
and
we
think
that
threats
to
take
that
man's
money
away
or
threats
being
used
as
weapons
to
remove
that
money
are
never
considered
free
speech
and
for
that
reason
of
course,
we
feel
that
very
initially
this
statute
is
just
not
unconstitutional,
it's
being
a
violation
of
the
first
amendment.
we
may
have
misled
this
court
in
reaching
these
conclusions
about
this
being
a
statute
that
prohibits
threats
when
we
set
out
our
question
presented
on
page
4
of
our
brief.
our
question
presented
said
that
this
statute
is
an
extortion
statute
that
deals
with
threats
to
commit
crimes.
a
more
accurate
statement
would
be
that
this
was
a
statute
that
prohibits
one
from
taking
or
attempting
to
take
the
property
or
to
protect
the
rights
of
another
through
the
use
of
threats
to
commit
crimes.
and
we
think
it's
in
that
light
that
this
statute
ought
be
viewed.
the
very
first
issue
in
this
case
is
one
of
standing.
the
plaintiffs
here
were
seven
subclasses
of
black
people
in
chicago,
all
claiming
to
be
black
activists
and
all
under
certain
pending
state
charges
and
the
defendants
here
were
all,
who
are
the
appellants
in
this
case,
all
members
of
the
official
dome
of
the
city
of
chicago
in
the
county
of
cook
who
were
charged
with
the
prosecution
of
the
appellees.
none
of
the
appellees
were
charged
with
this
intimidation
statute
at
anytime
and
there
are
no
pending
state
charges
against
the
appellees.
the
appellees
in
their
complaint
stated
that
all
the
statutes
involved
and
there
were
five
of
them
including
violence,
resisting
arrest,
aggravated
assault,
aggravated
battery
and
intimidation
were
all
being
used
by
the
defendants
in
furtherance
of
a
bad-faith
conspiracy
to
keep
these
appellees
from
exercising
their
first
amendment
rights
and
they
used
the
dombrowski
allegations
of
a
chilling
effect
and
bad-faith
conspiracy
and
they
say
these
words.
there
was
an
answer
filed
denying
the
existence
of
this
conspiracy
and
a
three-judge
court
sat
and
heard
the
threshold
question
of
the
constitutionality
of
this
statute
on
its
face.
by
the
way,
there
never
has
been
a
trial
and
onto
the
merits
of
this
complaint
there
has
be
no
proof
of
any
bad-faith
conspiracy
existing
among
these
appellants,
defendants
below
to
do
the
acts
of
which
they
were
accused
in
the
complaint.
mr.
dean
h.
bilton
the
three-judge
court
issued
a
declaratory
judgment
and
then
it
issued
pursuant
to
that
declaration
that
this
subsection
of
the
intimidation
act
was
unconstitutional.
it
then
issued
a
blanket
injunction
stopping
state
attorney's
office
of
cook
county
for
prosecuting
anybody
under
this
particular
intimidation
subsection.
it
didn't
--
mr.
dean
h.
bilton
right,
there
are
never
was
any
prosecution
of
any
plaintiff
here
under
the
section
at
all.
mr.
dean
h.
bilton
in
a
very
pure
broad
abstract
sense,
that's
correct.
by
the
way
the
one
subsection
of
the
intimidation
said
statute
that
was
said
out
in
the
complaint
was
a
section
that
refers
to
intimidation
by
public
officials.
it
wouldn't
have
applied
to
the
plaintiff's
at
all.
it
was
intimidations
by
a
public
official
in
withholding
his
own
action
or
doing
something
that
he
shouldn't
have
done.
so
truly,
when
we
went
to
our
hearing
before
the
three-judge
court,
no
one
under
--
really
understood
what
was
the
problem
with
the
intimidation
statute?
it
wasn't
until
after
the
three-judge
court
opinion
that
we
find
out
and
discover
that
the
court
thought
that
this
one
subsection
is
over
broad.
now,
looking
at
standing,
the
court
said
that
the
plaintiffs
had
standing
because
they
were
not
charged
with
any
of
the
offenses
here
and
that
therefore
they
came
under
the
right
of
the
dombrowski
case
and
the
zwickler
case
to
give
such
people
declaratory
judgments
when
they
claim
that
their
first
amendment
rights
are
being
infringed
upon.
we
submit
to
this
court
that
both
dombrowski
and
zwickler
are
quite
distinguishable.
in
both
dombrowski
and
zwickler,
the
plaintiffs
there
had
a
history
in
louisiana
and
in
new
york
of
having
the
statutes
that
they
complained
about
being
used
against
them.
mr.
dombrowski
held
up
his
organization
in
louisiana
and
he
was
arrested
and
he
was
charged
with
violating
a
louisiana
sedition
statute
and
then
a
motion
of
quash
stopped
that
prosecution
against
mr.
dombrowski.
he
then
went
into
the
federal
district
court
and
sought
relief
to
stop
future
prosecutions
under
that
over
broad
statute.
so,
we
had
a
history
of
facts
that
he
could
point
to
and
said,
"look,
are
they
going
to
do
that
to
me
again."
and
in
fact,
the
state
of
louisiana
(inaudible)
mr.
dombrowski
by
rating
him
shortly
after
he
filed
his
complaint
in
the
district
court
and
indicted
him
for
the
sedition
statute.
and
in
zwickler
case,
a
new
york
man
who
was
distributing
handbills
anonymously,
he
was
arrested
and
he
was
found
guilty
under
a
new
york
statute
that
said,
"you
can't
distribute
election
campaign
literature
anonymously
in
quantity."
his
conviction
was
later
overturned
by
the
new
york
supreme
court
on
the
criminal
elements
but
didn't
reach
the
constitutional
points.
zwickler,
then
went
to
the
us
district
court,
filed
his
complaint
for
declaratory
judgment
and
said,
"i'm
going
to
do
the
same
thing
in
the
next
election
and
they're
going
to
apply
the
statute
to
me
again
in
the
next
election."
so,
he
too
had
some
facts
that
he
could
point
to
justify
his
conclusions
that
the
state
was
going
to
apply
this
over
broad
statute
against
him.
now,
in
our
case
none
of
the
15
or
so
named
plaintiffs
nor
the
organization
act
or
any
of
the
plaintiffs
that
joined
in
later
on
or
ever
were
charged
with
this
intimidation
statute.
they
didn't
even
set
it
out
in
their
complaint.
so,
we
don't
believe
that
a
person
has
the
right
to
come
in
to
the
district
court
and
to
say
the
magic
words,
to
say
that
my
first
amendment
rights
are
being
chilled
and
that
gives
him
an
automatic
right
to
get
a
declaratory
judgment
of
any
statute
that
he
still
chooses
and
that's
what
happened
in
this
case.
so,
for
those
reasons
we
do
not
believe
that
the
plaintiffs
here
in
the
first
place
had
standing
to
challenge
the
act
that
they
did.
i
will
admit
however
that
both
dombrowski
and
zwickler
do
give
the
federal
courts
jurisdiction
to
sit
in
declaratory
judgments
when
a
person
is
not
charged
with
a
pending
state
case.
now,
looking
at
the
statute
itself
or
on
its
merits,
we
do
not
believe
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
and
our
brief
from
pages
13
to
page
20,
we
have
a
compilation
of
the
first
amendment
cases
as
best
we
could
and
we
drew
two
conclusions
and
that
is
one,
that
first
amendment
cases
are
treated
on
a
case
by
case
basis.
the
rule
of
law
seems
to
be
that
to
balance
the
interest
of
the
speaker
against
whatever
state
interest
is
involved.
well,
in
this
statute
the
interest
of
the
speaker
is
that
of
a
thief.
he
is
attempting
to
take
something
from
another
person
by
the
use
of
threats
and
the
protected
interest
involved
is
the
states'
right
to
protect
individuals
in
their
person
and
in
their
safety
and
in
their
possessions.
we
don't
think
there's
any
--
there's
no
contest
here.
on
those
--
on
that
test
alone,
the
statute
should
be
considered
a
valid
exercise
of
the
states'
power
and
not
over
broad
statute.
i
believe
that
the
three-judge
court
misunderstood
the
statute
because
it
said
that
the
statute
was
over
broad
because
it
prohibited
threats
of
insubstantial
evil.
well,
this
is
incorrect
in
two
ways.
first
of
all,
the
statute
doesn't
prohibit
threats.
it
prohibits
extortion
by
threats,
it
prohibits
robbery
by
threats,
but
it
doesn't
prohibit
threats
in
the
abstract.
people
can
get
up
and
speak
about
advocating
crime.
they
can
get
up
and
threaten
all
they
want.
if
there
is
no
extortion
element
present,
this
statute
doesn't
prohibit
that
kind
of
conduct.
mr.
dean
h.
bilton
"give
me
your
money
or
i
will
commit
a
kidnapping,"
yes.
mr.
dean
h.
bilton
well,
give
me
your
money
because
--
mr.
dean
h.
bilton
it
probably
be
--
in
that
sense,
it
probably
would
overlap
with
kidnapping
and
certainly
overlaps
with
robbery
because
it's
at
the
same
kind
of
statute
depending
how
close
the
intimidating
factor
is.
if
i
hold
a
gun
in
your
head
and
say,
"give
me
your
money
or
i'll
kill
you
in
five
minutes,"
i
might
be
committing
extortion
or
i
might
be
committing
robbery,
depending
on
whether
or
not
the
incidence
of
violence
is
immediate
or
delayed.
extortion
is
that
statute
which
picks
up
where
robbery
leaves
off.
yes,
i
believe
that
there
is
an
overlapping
here
with
other
state
statutes.
secondly,
that
the
court
in
that
one
statement
about
the
statute
prohibiting
threats
of
insubstantial
evil,
this
idea
of
insubstantial
evil
was
a
question
that
even
victim
has
to
answer.
what
might
be
a
very
small
weapon
to
a
court
might
be
a
very
major
weapon
to
the
victim.
so,
when
the
court
said
that
there
are
little
crimes
which
might
not
be
too
scary
to
a
person
they
did
not
--
the
court
didn't
place
itself
in
the
shoes
of
that
victim.
he
might
be
just
the
kind
of
a
person
that
would
be
intimidated
by
a
small
offense.
now,
the
point
that
the
court
i
believe
did
loss
sight
of
the
object
of
the
protection
of
the
statute
and
thought
that
this
was
a
public
order
statute,
i'd
like
to
just
point
to
the
opinion
that's
set
out
in
page
94
of
our
appendix
and
may
i
just
read
these
two
sentences
here
or
three
sentences.
the
court
said,
"indeed,
the
phrase,
commit
any
criminal
offense
is
so
broad
as
to
include
threats
to
commit
misdemeanors
punishable
by
fine
only.
these
evils
are
not
so
substantial
that
the
state's
interest
in
prohibiting
the
threat
of
them
outweighs
the
public
interest
in
giving
legitimate
political
discussion
a
wide
birth.
since
the
language
of
subparagraph
a
(3)
is
an
over
broad
restriction
and
the
freedom
of
speech
is
invalid,
obviously
however,
if
the
threat
is
carried
out,
the
persons
who
violate
the
criminal
law
by
their
acts
are
subject
to
punishment."
well,
this
notion
that
it
is
better
to
let
man
threaten
and
speak
to
preserve
the
first
amendment
and
then
arrest
him
when
he
commits
action
is
a
good
notion
for
statutes
that
protect
public
order,
but
if
i
say
to
you,
"give
me
your
money
or
i
will
break
your
windows
later
on"
and
you
give
me
your
money,
i
never
carry
out
the
threat.
so,
the
action
here,
the
threat
here
is
a
weapon
and
the
weapon
--
mr.
dean
h.
bilton
of
course,
just
as
the
caliber
of
the
weapon
used
in
a
robbery
is
irrelevant.
i
presume
you
could
commit
a
robbery
with
a
gun
or
a
pea
shooter.
the
pea
shooter
doesn't
seem
to
be
very
dangerous,
but
when
held
up
next
to
someone's
eye
might
be
just
enough
to
make
the
man
part
with
his
wallet
and
you
can
commit
a
robbery
by
not
pulling
the
trigger
of
the
gun.
you
can
hold
the
gun
and
say,
"here
i
have
a
gun,
give
me
your
money."
you
pay
the
man
your
money
and
he
does
not
shoot
you.
so,
this
notion
in
first
amendment
cases
that
we
can
wait
until
the
threat
or
act
doesn't
apply
to
cases
involved
in
protection
of
the
individual
because
--
mr.
dean
h.
bilton
oh!
yes,
it
has
a
chilling
effect
on
the
victim,
yes
[attempt
to
laughter].
so,
for
that
reason
we
believed
that
court
was
misconstruing
this
statute
in
such
away
so
that
that
they
believe
it
was
a
public
order
statute.
when
i
talked
about
legitimate
political
discussion
to
this
day,
i
fail
to
see
how
intimidating
a
person
to
either
take
his
vote
by
threatening
crimes
against
him
or
intimidating
a
public
official
by
taking
away
his
freedom
of
speech
by
threatening
crimes
against
him
can
be
considered
legitimate
political
discussion.
telling
a
congressman,
mr.
congressman
vote
for
my
program
or
advocate
my
program
or
i
will
commit
an
act
of
violence
or
i
will
kill
you.
this
certainly
is
pretty
powerful
lobbying
and
i
don't
believe
that
this
ought
to
be
protected
free
speech.
the
court
said
in
holding
the
statute
unconstitutional
that
the
statute
was
not
vague,
but
it
was
over
broad
because
it
had
little
crimes
included
in
the
threats
of
the
criminal
conduct.
the
definition
of
what
is
and
what
is
not
over
broad
was
set
out
by
this
court
in
the
zwickler
case
and
this
court
said
that
over
breadth
is
that
which
is
the
constitutional
principle
that
a
governmental
purpose
to
control
or
prevent
activities
causing
subject
to
state
regulation
may
not
be
achieved
by
means
where
a
sweep
unnecessarily
broadly
and
thereby
invade
the
area
of
protected
freedoms.
there
seems
to
be
two
factors
in
this
concept
of
over
breath;
one
is
this
wide
sweep
and
one
is
the
invasion
of
the
area
of
protected
freedoms.
initially,
we
do
not
think
that
the
thief
has
any
protected
freedom
to
try
to
take
property
from
another
by
threatening
crimes.
an
as
far
as
this
wide
sweep
is
concerns,
we
have
said
out
in
our
brief
a
comparison
of
this
statute
with
the
federal
extortion
statutes
and
all
the
state
extortion
statutes.
mr.
dean
h.
bilton
it
does
not
violate
this
section.
mr.
dean
h.
bilton
i'll
see
to
it
that
you
get
no
more
profits
is
not
a
crime
(voice
overlaps)
--
mr.
dean
h.
bilton
but
you
didn't
include
that
last
factor
of
committing
a
crime.
your
first
example
mr.
justice
marshall,
you
said
that
if
you
do
not
hire
more
negroes
we
will
see
to
it
that
you
receive
no
more
profits.
they
might
boycott
the
store,
people
might
not
shop
there,
that
isn't
a
commission
of
a
crime
in
illinois.
mr.
dean
h.
bilton
well,
if
those
--
i
believe
you're
trying
to
drive
that
those
words
being
threatening
words
to
commit
a
physical
violence
on
the
man.
subtly,
are
you
going
to
be
making
that
subtly,
they
are
saying,
"either
you
hire
negroes
or
we
will
hurt
you,"
but
they
are
saying
that
suddenly.
mr.
dean
h.
bilton
it's
not
covered
by
this
section
because
this
section
only
prohibits
threats
that
commit
crimes
and
since
there
is
no
threat
there
to
commit
a
crime
it
would
not
be
covered
by
this
section.
mr.
dean
h.
bilton
well,
i
don't
think
it's
a
crime
in
illinois
to
put
another
man
out
of
business
legally.
[attempt
to
laughter]
mr.
dean
h.
bilton
that's
correct.
mr.
dean
h.
bilton
that's
correct.
mr.
dean
h.
bilton
it
would
not
come
on
the
stage.
mr.
dean
h.
bilton
that's
correct!
absolutely
correct!
the
threat
here
must
be
a
threat
to
commit
a
crime
and
that
was
a
section
that
was
held
to
be
over
broad.
mr.
dean
h.
bilton
yes,
this
--
mr.
dean
h.
bilton
yes,
it
would.
the
only
problem
there
is
a
problem
of
the
prosecutor
proving
up
all
the
elements
of
this
crime
beyond
unreasonable
doubt.
so,
he
must
convince
that
jury
that
the
words
used
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
carry
that
innuendo
to
have
violence
connected
with
this
threat.
it's
true,
it
would
cover
direct
threats
and
threats
by
innuendo.
we
deal
there
though
with
problems
of
proof
rather
than
the
abstract
cases
that
we
have
here.
mr.
dean
h.
bilton
no.
no,
in
that
regard
it
--
in
a
sense
with
every
other
extortion
statute
in
this
country
you
need
not
tell
a
man
directly
that
you
intend
to
do
him
violence
if
he
gets
the
message
by
innuendo.
what
we're
trying
to
protect
is
people
from
being
relieved
of
their
possessions
if
by
force
or
by
coercion.
now
we
have
set
forth
a
comparison
in
our
brief
of
relevant
federal
statutes
including
the
hubs
act
and
other
state
statutes
involving
extortion
and
we
believe
that
our
statute
in
illinois
is
far
narrower
than
those
acts
which
committed
extortion
under
the
hubs
act.
i
direct
your
honors'
attention
to
nick
versus
the
united
states
and
us
versus
campagna,
both
cited
in
our
brief
where
a
person
committed
extortion
by
threatening
the
movie
industry
to
pull
out
the
projection
list
unless
he
received
an
illegal
payoff.
well,
here
the
act
threatened
were
just
to
commit
a
tort
or
to
commit
an
unfair
labor
of
practice,
an
illegal
strike.
in
illinois,
of
course
we
prohibit
threats
of
crimes
and
to
do
a
crime
is
do
something
which
is
far
more
narrower
in
scope
than
to
commit
torts.
or
they
have
said
out
the
communications
act
in
the
federal
government
which
prohibits
extortion
by
telephoning
a
person
and
injuring
the
reputation,
threatening
to
injure
reputation
of
the
person
or
another
person
either
living
or
deceased
which
is
certainly
far
broader
in
scope
in
the
illinois
statute
here.
mr.
dean
h.
bilton
well,
if
i
prevail
on
my
dombrowski
point
that's
true.
we're
left
then
in
the
illinois
with
unconstitutional
declaration
of
a
statute
with
the
case
reversed
on
other
grounds.
our
statute
as
it
sits
right
now,
it
has
been
declared
by
a
three-judge
court
to
be
unconstitutional.
in
all
honesty,
mr.
zwickler
was
not
under
a
pending
state
charge
when
he
went
into
the
court
and
neither
was
mr.
dombrowski
and
for
that
reason
the
district
court
in
illinois
knowing
full
well
that
these
people
were
not
charged
with
the
statute
but
seeing
their
complaint
where
they
said
that
they
were
threatened
by
the
application
of
the
statute
by
a
bad
faith
conspiracy
said
that
they're
still
in
the
same
position
that
mr.
zwickler
did.
mr.
dean
h.
bilton
that's
correct.
mr.
dean
h.
bilton
i
agree,
yes.
mr.
dean
h.
bilton
well,
the
opinion
on
the
declaratory
feature
of
course
for
all
practical
purposes
takes
away
this
particular
statute
from
using
illinois.
it
is
however
amiable
statute,
we
have
several
other
sections
and
we're
not
completely
devoid
of
an
extortion
law
in
illinois.
but
this
is
a
very
important
section
though
because
it
is
the
one
that
allows
us
to
cope
with
new
and
inventive
crooks.
the
other
subsections
are
ones
that
are
the
traditional
extortion
elements,
the
blackmail
elements,
the
threats
in
the
reputations.
this
section
is
the
one
that
allows
us
not
to
sit
back
and
let
a
person
commit
extortion
that
isn't
covered
by
the
other
section
and
if
he
commits,
if
he
threatens
a
crime
then
we
move
in.
mr.
dean
h.
bilton
well,
if
this
court
did
rule
that
the
appellants
--
appellees
had
no
standing
to
bring
their
complaint
to
the
district
court
--
mr.
dean
h.
bilton
i
beg
your
pardon,
i
didn't
quite
understand.
mr.
dean
h.
bilton
no,
you
have
to
seek
injunction
which
every
declaratory
judgment
does,
seeks
the
injunction.
mr.
dean
h.
bilton
well,
if
the
standing
to
bring
the
case
to
court
falls
everything
seems
to
fall
with
it,
but
for
the
fact
that
there
are
other
people
who
will
do
the
same
thing
again
and
might
be
charged
with
intimidation
and
we're
back
again
to
where
we
started,
trying
to
support
statute
that's
alleged
to
be
over
broad
and
we
have
holding
in
illinois
that
the
statute
is
over
broad
and
the
case
was
first
on
the
grounds.
it
would
not
help
the
appellants
in
this
case
at
all.
getting
back
to
our
comparison,
we
did
compare
this
statute
with
all
the
other
states.
we
found
40
other
states
having
broader
threats
than
ours
do
and
especially
states
such
as
utah
which
prohibit
coercion
or
extortion
by
threats
of
any
nature.
we
think
our
statute
is
quite
narrowly
drawn
when
compared
to
the
statutes
in
the
rest
of
the
states
and
the
statutes
of
the
federal
government.
whatever
time
i
have
left,
i'd
like
to
reserve
for
rebuttal.
thank
you.
mr.
dean
h.
bilton
i
only
wish
to
rebut
one
statement.
mr.
reid
just
said
that
in
illinois
you
can
threaten
to
commit
a
disorderly
conduct
and
wind
up
in
prison
for
five
years.
you
can
only
do
that
in
illinois
if
you
threaten
to
commit
disorderly
conduct
while
you
are
attempting
to
steal
from
a
person
or
while
you
are
attempting
to
rob
from
a
person
or
why
you
are
attempting
to
extort
something
from
that
person.
threats
of
disorderly
conduct
in
the
abstract
are
not
prohibited
by
this
statute
or
whatsoever
because
this
is
not
a
public
order
statute,
this
is
the
statute
which
protects
the
person.
other
than
that
i
think
that
my
argument
in
chief
covered
all
the
points
that
mr.
reid
talked
about
and
i
have
no
further
rebuttal
but
just
to
respectfully
request
this
court
to
reverse
the
three-judge
court
below
and
restore
the
illinois
statute
that
we
feel
is
very
important
in
our
scheme
about
criminal
code.
thank
you
very
much.
