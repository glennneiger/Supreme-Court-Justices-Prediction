mr.
springer,
what's
the
reason
for
serving
his
sentence
while
this
case
is
on
appeal?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
should
he
be
serving
his
sentence
which
is
on
appeal?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
don't
know
of
any
provision
in
the
civilian
court
that
requires
that
he
stay
in
prison.
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
did
in
this
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
why?
why
in
this
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
then
what's
danger
of
fleeing
a
military
installation?
why
couldn't
he
be
confined
to
the
camp?
justice
thurgood
marshall
my
final
question
is,
this
case
it's
now
in
the
court
of
military
appeals
if
the
petitioner
wins
he
just
lost
a
year
or
is
that
a
present,
am
i
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
i
said
if
the
they
find
that
he
was
not
convicted
legally
under
the
military
code?
justice
thurgood
marshall
approximately,
how
long
does
it
take
to
process
the
case
through
the
military
court
of
appeals?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how
does
the
regular
one
take?
justice
thurgood
marshall
over
a
year,
isn't
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
that
anybody
with
one
year
sentence
he
might
just
well
forget
about
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
the
military
lawyer
for
the
military
prisoner
required
to
go
for
habeas
corpus?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i'm
not
talking
--
well,
i
would
suggest
that
the
military
lawyer
for
the
military
prisoner
would
really
be
an
outstanding
one
if
he
did
go
for
habeas
corpus.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
approximately
how
many
writs
of
habeas
corpus
are
filed
a
year?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes,
