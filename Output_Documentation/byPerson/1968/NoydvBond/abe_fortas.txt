justice
abe
fortas
well,
i'm
sorry
but
i
don't
quite
get
your
answer
to
the
solicitor
general's
principle
argument
on
mootness
as
i
understand
it
which
is
--
that
sounds
has
expired
and
terminated
and
the
show
is
over,
isn't
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
what
is
your
reply
to
that?
justice
abe
fortas
and
you
say
that
just
as
mr.
justice
douglas'
order
did
that?
justice
abe
fortas
how?
justice
abe
fortas
but
under
the
rule,
criminal
justice
i
understand
it
that
the
computation
of
the
amount
of
time
that
the
man
has
served
does
not
depend
on
whether
he
is
or
he's
not
in
confinement.
that's
the
rule
that
justice
stewart
is
talking
about.
justice

57
(b).
justice
abe
fortas
well,
now
what
suspended
the
senate
as
to
--
that's
not
the
same
thing
as
releasing
a
man
from
confinement,
is
it?
justice
abe
fortas
what
do
you
introduce
from
that
with
respect
to
this
case?
justice
abe
fortas
what
is
a
government's
position
with
respect
to
the
power
of
a
district
judge
let
us
say
federal
district
judge
to
direct
that
prisoner
held
on
the
court-martial
to
be
released
pending
further
procedures?
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that
but
suppose
it's
not
that?
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
it's
a
question
of
alleged
misapplication
of
statutory
remedy
or
statutory
right
denial
of
statutory
right.
justice
abe
fortas
(voice
overlap)
--
the
allegation
here?
justice
abe
fortas
you
mean
that
the
district
judge,
suppose
he
says
comes
in
to
district
court
and
says,
my
court-martial
proceeding
has
been
concluded,
have
been
found
guilty,
i've
gone
to
the
court
of
military
justice
and
ask
to
be
released
pending
their
review,
the
have
denied
it,
i
come
here
ask
to
be
released
pending
completion
of
the
administrative
process.
justice
abe
fortas
but
you
would
say
that
the
power
does
exist?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
you
and
i
understand
that
we're
talking
about
the
case
like
this
one
where
the
allegation
is
that
there
has
been
a
denial
of
statutory
right.
now,
the
question
of
jurisdiction
and
then
in
that
case
you
nevertheless
take
the
position
that
there
is
power
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
in
the
district
court
even
though
i
understand
what
you
say
about
the
--
justice
abe

that's
right
they
have
exercised.
