justice

well,
i
know
but
mr.
justice
marshall
asked
you
what
is
the
reason
for
the
provision
that
saying
that
sentence
runs
whether
you're
confined
or
not.
now,
let's
assume
the
case
where
he
is
not
confined
at
all
on
appeal
the
sentence
still
runs,
why?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
is
one
peculiar
rule
i
think
that
you're
saying
and
that
law
seems
to
say
that
it
just
runs
--

you

you

what
you're

runs
when
he's
confined

it
doesn't
run
on
the

what
difference
does
it
make
for

of
your
mootness
argument?
it

any
difference
at
all.

his

that

he
was
sentence

wasn't
it?

that

couldn't

it
couldn't
be
executed
so
called,
could
it?
justice

now,
that

he
couldn't

yes,

he

be
confined
at
hard
labor
until
there
has
been
an
affirmance?
