mr.
james
van
r.
springer
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
captain
noyd's
air
force
career
has
in
fact
given
rise
to
a
number
of
difficult
questions
about
the
government
and
regulation
of
the
armed
forces.
mr.
karpatkin
enumerated
some
of
the
history
of
the
litigation
in
which
he
has
been
involved.
his
principle
claim
concerning
the
alleged
impropriety
and
the
denial
of
conscientious
objector
status
to
him
is
now
before
the
court
of
military
appeals.
it
may
well
return
to
the
civil
courts
and
it
may
well
return
here
but
those
questions
are
not
involved
in
the
case
that
is
here
now.
in
contrast,
this
case
involves
at
bottom
what
is
a
rather
narrow
and
highly
technical
question
of
military
penology.
the
nature
of
the
restraints
that
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice
permits
the
military
to
put
upon
a
serviceman
after
a
court-martial
conviction
and
while
he's
in
the
process
of
exhausting
his
military
rights
to
appeal.
fortuitously,
this
case
comes
here
with
captain
noyd
as
the
defendant
but
it
might
as
well
have
been
a
more
conventional
serviceman
charged
for
the
routine
military
offense
and
of
course
it's
important
to
recognize
that
the
legal
principles
for
which
the
petitioners
arguing
here
are
principles
that
would
apply
across
the
board
in
military
cases
to
any
military
defendant
whether
he
was
charged
with
desertion
or
murder
or
any
other
crime
that
could
appropriately
be
tried
by
a
court-martial.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
believe
not
in
the
code.
in
the
regulations,
there
are
certain
more
or
less
technical
distinctions
in
the
treatment
that
may
be
given
to
an
officer
as
distinguished
from
enlisted
man
at
any
particular
point.
this
of
course
arises
out
of
the
time
on
distinctions
that
have
existed
in
the
services
in
those
regards.
in
our
brief
and
in
our
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
the
general
applicability.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
throughout
the
air
force
and
of
course
throughout
all
the
services
because
it
is
a
uniform
code.
in
our
brief
and
in
our
submissions,
in
response
to
the
petition
for
certiorari,
we
have
raised
the
suggestion
that
this
case
may
have
become
moot
because
of
certain
technical
rules
in
the
code
relating
to
the
service
of
confinement
to
the
service
of
military
sentences
to
confinement.
i
would
suggest
unless
the
court
desires
otherwise
that
we
simply
refer
the
court
to
what
we
have
said
in
our
brief.
i
think
there's
a
little
more
that
can
be
said.
in
any
event,
there
seems
to
be
agreement
on
the
fact
that
at
the
most,
captain
noyd
has
two
days
remaining
to
serve
on
his
sentence
to
confinement.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
think
certainly
if
the
sentence
were
in
fact
suspended
mr.
justice
douglas
by
your
order.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
if
that
have
been
the
effect
i
think
it
would
certainly
follow
that
the
case
is
not
moot
and
there
are
two
days
remaining.
i
might
just
point
out
in
that
regard
that
a
recent
amendment
to
article
57
(b)
that
is
not
applicable
here
but
which
will
become
applicable
on
august
1st
of
this
year.
it
does
perhaps
cast
some
light
on
what
the
meaning
of
suspension
is.
that
amendment
for
the
first
time
introduces
something
approximating
bail
in
the
military
and
says
that
a
commanding
officer
may
defer
service
of
a
sentence
to
confinement.
and
the
sentence
in
the
existing
article
57
(b)
to
which
you
have
referred
mr.
justice
douglas
is
now
amended
to
read
effective
august
1,
1969
that
periods
during
which
the
sentence
to
confinement
is
suspended
or
deferred
shall
be
excluded
in
computing
the
service
of
the
term
of
confinement.
so
i
would
suggest
for
what
it's
worth
that
that
is
some
perhaps
after
the
fact
indication
by
congress
as
to
what
suspension
may
have
meant.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
that
that
the
release
from
confinement
is
not
tantamount
to
a
suspension
within
the
meaning
of
article
57
(b)
as
it
reads
effective
august
1,
1969
or
effective
in
noyd's
case.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
is
the
question,
why
should
the
man
be
in
confinement
while
he
is
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
well,
perhaps
i
have
to
break
that
down.
if
there
are
--
as
there
are
in
the
civilian
courts
of
course,
provisions
allowing
a
man
to
be
in
prison
or
in
confinement
pending
on
appeal.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
no
and
of
course
we're
not
suggesting
that
the
army
is
required
to
keep
him
in
prison.
basically,
our
position
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes.
is
that
act
in
the
case
of
the
civilian
trial,
there
is
discretion.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
well,
there
are
number
of
elements
that
could
go
in
to
the
commanding
officer's
exercise
to
this
discretion,
one
that
has
been
suggested
and
conceded
by
mr.
karpatkin
is
the
desire
to
avoid
flight.
there
are
--
well
the
bail
reform
act
of
1966
states
as
to
civilian
criminals
that
in
addition
to
that
reason
a
danger
to
the
community
maybe
(voice
overlap).
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
that
certainly
is
what
--
would
be
a
factor
to
go
into
the
military
commanding
officer's
discretion.
i
think
and
my
only
point
here
is
that
there
is
a
discretion,
well
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
well,
of
course,
he
has
at
the
most
two
days
mr.
justice
left
to
serve
on
his
sentence.
in
any
event,
he
has
been
under
an
obligation
to
the
service
to
stay
in.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
it
is
certainly
true
that
in
a
sense
it's
then
retroactively
no
reason
for
him
to
have
been
confined
while
his
appeal
was
pending.
of
course
the
--
it's
(voice
overlap)
to
which
civilian
criminals
are
also
subject.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
that's
correct
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes.
i
might
suggest
which
is
that
he
has
of
course
been
under
some
restraints.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
there
are
number
of
reasons
perhaps
there
are
peculiar
rules
about
the
computation
of
sentences
within
the
service,
pretend
there
are
no
concurrence
sentences.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes.
well,
i
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
this
maybe
an
element
of
equity
that
there
are
no
concurrent
sentences.
it
maybe
also
that
it
is
in
fact
i
think
probably
less
easy
to
be
released
on
--
to
be
relieved
for
serviceman
to
be
relieve
of
confinement
while
his
appeal
is
pending
under
the
rules
on
the
manual
court-martial
that
apply
here,
for
that
reason
it
maybe
appropriate
to
say
that
there
is
credit
in
fact.
i
must
say
that
this
is
a
question
of
judgment.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
no,
it
runs
one
way
or
another
and
of
course
there
are
these
technical
problems
as
to
what
is
confinement
and
what
is
not.
we
say
that
in
fact
the
status
in
which
captain
noyd
was
though
it
was
undoubtedly
unpleasant
to
him
and
restricted
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
whether
he
was
in
fact
confined
or
that
is
true
and
i
think
there's
no
question
in
whatever
that
that
whatever
the
reason
maybe
article
57
(b)
does
make
a
sentence
run.
no
matter
what
the
treatment
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
but
we
say
certainly
in
the
ordinary
case
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
not
in
restraint,
does
not,
is
clearly
not
amount
to
a
suspension.
now,
there
is
a
(voice
overlap)
different
question.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
he
was.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
could
not
be
executed
until
after
the
military
of
that
review
was
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
he
could
not
be
confined
at
hard
labor.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes.
i
suggest
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
serving
at
only
in
the
technical
sense
that
he
receives
credit
for
it
not
serving
in
any
--
in
the
sense
of
what
he
is
compelled
to
do.
we
do
not
derive
any
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
and
of
course
that
is
the
basis
of
our
mootness
argument
that
confinement
and
service
are
in
this
peculiar
code
we're
dealing
with
different
things.
we
have
also
urged
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
right
in
creating
the
merits
of
captain
noyd's
claim
is
improperly
before
the
civil
courts
because
of
his
failure
to
exhaust
the
remedy
in
the
military
courts
that
was
clearly
available
to
him
at
the
time
that
he
came
to
the
civil
courts.
this
is
an
important
point,
it's
one
i
would
like
to
return
to
but
i
think
perhaps
it
would
be
helpful
if
i
discuss
the
merits
even
though
we
have
two
reasons
for
saying
why
the
merits
should
not
be
reached.
i
think
it
perhaps
it
will
put
the
case
and
better
focus.
mr.
karpatkin's
argument,
at
least
orally,
rests
largely
upon
his
interpretation
of
article
71
(c)
of
the
code
which
is
the
provision
that
prohibits
the
execution
of
a
sentence
until
it
has
been
completely
reviewed
by
the
military
courts
and
in
the
case
of
an
officer
such
as
captain
noyd
by
the
service
secretary.
he
says
that
for
this
reason
the
order
directing
that
captain
noyd
be
sent
to
the
special
officer
facilities
at
for
leavenworth
was
an
improper
order.
i
think
the
first
thing
that
should
be
said
about
that
is
that
whatever
else
may
be
moot
in
this
case
certainly
the
order
sending
captain
noyd
purporting
to
send
captain
noyd
to
leavenworth
is
now
moot.
the
regulations
that
govern
such
matters
make
it
clear
that
no
man
can
be
sent
to
a
disciplinary
barracks
unless
he
has
six
months
remaining
to
serve
on
his
sentence.
now,
even
if
this
case
is
not
moot,
it
appears
to
be
a
great
that
there
are
only
two
days
left.
so,
for
that
reason,
i
think
that
the
leavenworth
order
which
has
been
suspended
is
ever
since
it
was
shortly
after
was
issued
by
the
order
of
the
district
court
and
to
stay
by
the
tenth
circuit
of
its
mandate.
i
would
suggest
that
that
order
is
not
as
a
practical
matter
in
issue
in
this
case.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
no,
mr.
justice.
the
district
court
said,
don't
send
him
to
leavenworth
but
do
whatever
else
you
want
this
tenth
circuit
reversed
that
and
said
that
the
case
should
not
have
been
entertained
but
has
state
its
mandate
pending
this
court's
action
so
that
order
has
remained
unfair.
in
any
event
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
no,
i
believe
not
as
technical
matter
mr.
justice
douglas.
there
have
been
certain
subsequent
orders
about
the
confinement
that
has
in
fact
taken
its
place.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
no,
it's
simply
by
operation
of
the
court's
order.
in
any
event,
we
would
suggest
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief
that
the
district
court's
disposition
of
the
leavenworth
order
reflected
either
a
misunderstanding
again
of
what
is
highly
technical
provision
in
the
military
law
as
to
what
execution
is
or
else
perhaps
in
this
matter
is
not
discussed
very
in
much
detail
in
the
district
court's
opinion,
a
misunderstanding
of
the
nature
of
the
confinement
to
which
captain
noyd
would
have
been
subjected
had
he
been
at
leavenworth.
there
are
in
fact
separate
facilities
with
very
separate
treatment
for
officers
awaiting
appeal,
they're
very
separate
and
different
from
the
facilities
and
treatment
they
are
given
to
regular
prisoners
at
leavenworth.
it
has
been
the
standard
practice
to
send
so-called
adjudged
officers
awaiting
appeal
to
leavenworth
rather
than
retaining
them
at
their
basis
because
of
the
special
problems
that
the
status
of
an
officer
creates
with
respect
to
restraints
on
his
base.
this
has
been
upheld
in
the
case
of
captain
levy
and
we
submit
that
it
was
not
an
abuse
of
discretion
or
an
execution
the
sentence
in
this
case.
but
as
i've
said,
i
don't
think
we
have
to
reach
the
leavenworth
order.
so
that
reduces
the
case
on
the
merits
if
the
merit
should've
been
reached
to
the
petitioner's
claim
that
the
restraint
to
which
he
was
subjected
at
cannon
air
force
base
where
he
has
been
stationed
at
the
pertinent
times
exceeded
what
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice
permits.
i
believe
it's
accurate
to
say
that
the
petitioner
concedes
that
some
restraint
of
a
convicted
person
and
convicted
officer
while
his
appeal
pending
is
permissible.
so
the
real
question
here
is
whether
the
restraint
that
was
imposed
upon
captain
noyd
by
his
arrest
in
quarters
was
a
proper
restraint.
the
answer
to
at
least
to
the
legal
principles
that
govern
the
question
of
the
restraint
that
is
allowed
require
the
locating
and
interpreting
of
a
number
of
different
provisions
of
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice
and
the
manual
for
courts-martial
which
of
course
is
an
executive
order
technically
of
the
president
and
of
course
has
the
force
of
law.
it
is
--
the
manual
is
promulgated
by
the
president
under
a
provision
of
the
uniform
code,
article
36
which
is
somewhat
like
the
rules
enabling
act
that
has
permitted
this
court
to
promulgate
the
rules
of
civil
and
criminal
procedure.
it's
the
direction
of
the
president
to
provide
for
the
procedure
in
cases
before
courts-martial.
now,
there
is
nothing
in
the
code
itself,
the
statutory
code
we
submit
that
that
speaks
expressly
to
the
question
of
restraint
of
a
convicted
prisoner
or
convicted
individual
while
his
appeal
is
pending.
but
there
are
certain
provisions
in
the
manual
which
do
speak
directly
to
this.
first,
is
article
--
is
paragraph
21
(d)
of
the
manual
which
provides
that
upon
notification
of
the
result
of
a
court-martial
trial
the
commanding
officer
of
the
defendant
in
that
trial
will
take
prompt
and
appropriate
action
with
respect
to
the
restraint
of
the
person
tried.
such
action,
and
i
continue
to
quote,
“depending
upon
the
circumstances
may
involve
the
immediate
release
of
the
person
from
any
restraint
or
the
imposition
of
any
necessary
restraint
pending
final
action
on
the
case.”
in
its
most
recent
statement
on
this
question
of
custody
pending
an
appeal
of
the
levy
case
some
two
years
ago,
the
court
of
military
appeals
held
that
although
there
is
no
such
thing
as
bail
in
the
sense
that
we
understand
it
in
the
military
system.
this
section
of
the
manual
does
give
the
commanding
officer
of
the
defendant
a
discretion
to
determine
what
custody
if
any
custody
is
appropriate
following
the
conviction.
and
the
court
of
military
appeals
in
that
levy
case
although
it
denied
captain
levy
release
made
it
very
clear
that
it
would
review
the
exercise
of
that
discretion
by
the
commanding
officer
involved
in
each
case
that
brought
to
it
on
habeas
corpus
and
would
reverse
the
commander's
action
if
the
discretion
was
abused.
the
first
step
of
review
of
a
court-martial
conviction
is
--
has
been
indicated
approval
by
the
commanding
--
by
the
convening
authority,
in
this
case
the
commander
of
the
twelfth
air
force
general
bond
and
there
are
provisions
--
there's
a
provision
relating
to
restraint
following
this
stage.
and
that
provision
is
paragraph
89
(c)
of
the
manual
for
courts-martial
that
directs
the
convening
authority
to
“provide
in
his
action
for
the
temporary
custody
of
the
accused
pending
final
disposition
of
the
case
upon
further
appellate
review
and
that
further
review
is
review
by
the
board
of
review
which
has
taken
place
in
this
case
and
by
the
court
of
military
appeals,
the
civilian
court
--
a
court
with
civilian
members
which
action
is
still
pending
in
captain
noyd's
case.”
one
other
provision
of
the
manual
relates
to
custody
pending
appeal
and
that
is
paragraph
18
(b)
(3)
of
the
manual
which
provides
that
no
punishment
other
than
restraint
imposed
in
accordance
with
regulations
may
be
imposed
upon
an
accused
while
his
appeal
is
pending.
we
think
it
is
clear
as
the
court
of
military
appeals
has
held
that
these
provisions
of
the
manual
issued
by
the
president
pursuant
to
statutory
authority
provide
a
basis
for
appropriate
restraint
pending
a
military
appeal.
now,
petitioner
contends
that
a
provision
of
the
code
does
in
fact
relate
to
this
article
13
which
says
that
the
arrest
or
confinement
of
a
person
“being
held
for
trial
or
the
result
of
trial
may
not
be
any
more
rigorous
than
the
circumstance
required
to
insure
his
presence.”
he
interprets
the
result
of
trial
to
include
appellate
review.
this,
we
think
is
wrong
if
nothing
else
in
light
of
the
caption
of
that
article
uniform
code
of
military
justice
which
says
punishment
prohibited
before
trial
and
in
fact
there
are
other
places
in
the
manual
whether
it
was
made
clear
that
the
result
of
the
trial
means
what
in
common
sense
term
you
would
think
it
was
me
the
result
of
the
trial
proceeding
itself
not
the
further
steps
of
appeal.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
suppose
result
of
trial
could
mean
while
the
jury
is
out
when
the
trial
proceeding
itself
is
over
and
you're
waiting
for
the
decision
that
will
result
from
that
trial
proceeding.
the
court-martial
was
still
in
progress
but
in
some
sense
the
trial
perhaps
may
be
over
it.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
in
any
event,
we
suggest
that
the
rule
for
which
petitioner
contends
in
this
interpretation
is
a
startling
one.
it
does
mean
that
in
the
military
despite
that
they
were
well
recognized
disciplinary
needs
of
the
military
a
convicted
serviceman
could
not
be
subjected
to
restraints
pending
appeal
that
are
allowed
in
the
case
of
a
civilian
prisoner
convicted
by
a
civilian
court
while
his
--
civilian
appeals
are
pending.
i
think
that
he
would
have
to
have
a
very
clear
statement
by
congress
that
this
was
truly
intended
before
we
should
accept
such
an
unusual
proposition.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
well,
i
was
going
to
say
i
don't
think
it
is
but
that
is
a
question,
a
question
is
what
--
the
question
at
this
point
is
what
are
the
legal
standards
that
should
be
applied
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
apart
from
mootness
and
apart
from
exhaustion,
i
think
the
question
is
whether
and
assuming
we
have
to
reach
the
merits,
the
question
is
whether
there
has
been
or
petitioner's
claim
is
really
that
there
has
been
an
abuse
of
discretion
in
determining
what
kind
of
restraint
is
appropriate.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
no,
but
he
is
entitled
to
a
reasonable
exercise
of
the
discretion
of
the
commanding
officers.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
on
this
point
mr.
justice
black,
i
confess
i
don't
see
a
difference
except
they
say
the
standard
is
different,
the
standard
is
the
article
13
standard
which
is
whether
this
a
risk
of
flight.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
would
certainly
say
that
is
what
the
case
when
you
boil
that
down
the
last
time
that
is
what
it
boils
down
to
and
on
that
of
course
we
would
say
that
it's
not
appropriate
for
civilian
court
at
least
on
the
facts
of
this
case
a
case
of
this
kind
to
review
that
discretion
of
the
military
officers.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
but
i
should
add
one
further
thing
and
this
gets
me
into
the
exhaustion
point.
that
discretion
is
reviewable
by
the
court
of
military
appeals
which
is
of
course
with
civilian
members
that
was
established
for
the
expressed
purpose
of
giving
a
kind
of
civilian
review
of
the
rights
of
serviceman.
that
court
has
a
supervisory
power
over
the
operation
of
military
justice
and
it's
a
power
that
it
has
articulated
itself
and
recognized
and
i
think
that
that
supervisory
power
gives
it
perhaps
a
good
deal
more
discretion
than
i
would
say
a
civilian
court
has.
a
good
deal
of
more
latitude
than
a
civilian
court
has
in
reviewing
the
discretion
of
the
military
officers.
i
think
this
court
has
recognized
that
its
supervisory
power
over
the
federal
criminal
justice
gives
that
good
deal
more
power
than
for
example
it's
more
strictly
legal
authority
over
state
of
criminal
justice.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
well,
in
this
case
--
well,
for
the
remedy
that
we
are
suggesting
here
habeas
corpus,
it
takes
no
longer
than
habeas
corpus
in
the
civilian
court
and
the
fact
that
is
what
happened
in
levy's
case.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
regular
review
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
would
say
yes
certainly
it's
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
well,
except
mr.
justice
marshall
and
this
is
the
military
remedy
to
which
we
really
point.
there
is
this
remedy
of
habeas
corpus
in
the
court
of
military
appeals
which
can
be
had
as
promptly
as
civilian
habeas
corpus.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
this
is
an
uncharted
area.
i
would
suggest
now
mr.
justice
marshall
that
just
and
perhaps
more
so
than
in
the
case
of
the
civilian
courts,
the
court
of
military
appeals
certainly
has
the
power
upon
receipt
of
a
petition
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
well,
i
think
perhaps
depending
on
as
in
any
case,
the
applications
of
a
lawyer
depend
upon
how
the
law
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
in
the
court
of
military
appeals?
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
think
there
have
been
relatively
few
this
far.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
because
that's
not
of
course
a
--
the
petition
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
but
i
suggest
that
there
is
no
reason
why
captain
noyd
could
not
have
file
such
a
petition
or
why
if
the
case
is
not
moot
he
could
not
file
such
a
petition
now.
i
think
he
can
get
more
relief
from
the
court
of
military
appeals
because
of
its
supervisory
power.
and
i
would
also
suggest
in
accordance
with
familiar
principles
of
exhaustion
of
remedies
and
other
where
areas
and
in
light
of
what
is
obviously
a
highly
technical
question
here
there
is
good
reason
why
the
expert
court
that
is
charged
with
working
out
these
matters
in
military
justice
should
ask
upon
them
before
a
civilian
court
is
asked
to
come
in
with
relatively
little
guidance
other
than
normally
the
guidance
that
civilian
counsel
can
give
it.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
it
was
--
of
the
order
of
nine
months
that
he
was
in
this
restrain
state
arrest
in
quarters.
of
course
if
assuming
that
he
had
gone
of
the
court
of
military
appeals
when
he
went
to
the
civilian
court,
he
could've
been
out
as
he
could've
been
in
the
case
of
a
civilian
habeas
corpus
within
the
matter
of
perhaps
a
week
or
two.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
well,
i
think
that
would
depend
upon
the
nature
of
the
question
that
he
raises.
mr.
karpatkin
has
referred
to
the
reid
and
covert
line
of
cases
where
the
claim
is
that
the
military
has
no
jurisdiction
to
try
this.
and
i
might
say
that
i
think
if
the
same
of
the
o'callahan
case
which
is
now
pending.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
if
it's
not
a
question
of
jurisdictional
power
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
well,
if
this
and
of
course
be
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
in
a
military
trial
or
in
here
has
not
in
the
trial
but
in
one
of
the
incidental
areas
related
to
trial.
we
would
suggest
that
the
position
is
the
same
as
to
exhaustion.
the
military
remedy
should
be
exhausted.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
certainly
mr.
justice,
the
civilian
court
would
have
jurisdiction
to
entertain
that
claim
as
to
whether
or
not
it
should
give
relief
we
would
suggest
that
the
old
standard
in
burns
and
wilson
is
still
the
standard
under
the
law
of
this
court
that
should
apply.
the
question
is
whether
or
not
the
military
courts
gave
fair
consideration
to
the
serviceman's
claim.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
certainly,
the
power
once
there
has
--
well,
the
power
exists
i
think
in
any
event,
i
think
the
case
should
not
be
entertained
as
a
matter
of
some
kind
of
judicial
discretion
and
there
has
not
been
exhaustion
when
there
has
been
exhaustion
clearly
there
is
power
and
let
it
just
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
find
it
difficult.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
find
it
difficult
to
concede
that
in
this
case
with
the
nature
of
the
claims
to
be
candid
that
there
would
be
any
room
left
for
civilian
court
to
do
any
thing
after
assuming
that
the
court
of
military
appeals.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
well,
of
course
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
well,
of
course
the
first
--
in
the
first
place
mr.
justice
douglas,
we
do
say
that
article
13
does
not
apply
to
the
post-conviction
period
pending
appeal.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
but
for
one
thing
looking
at
the
heading
of
that
section
where
it
says
no
punishment
before
trial.
we
suggest
that
that
provision
of
the
code
does
not
govern
the
period
when
appellate
review
is
pending.
in
any
event,
the
question
is
of
course
the
question
whether
or
not
discretion
was
abused
and
that
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes
but
i
say
it's
a
matter
of
discretion
with
the
appropriate
commander
to
determine
a
matter
reviewable
discretion.
of
course
to
determine
what
is
necessary
to
keep
this
prisoner
from
fleeing.
now,
for
example
in
the
case
of
captain
levy,
the
--
i
believe
the
district
court
in
kansas
has
held
that
has
reviewed
it
and
determined
that
that
was
a
permissible
exercise
of
discretion.
this
of
course,
in
light
of
the
fact,
that
the
man
was
an
officer
that
there
are
as
practical
matter
and
most
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
oh!
i'm
suggesting
that
the
words
as
a
result
of
trial
not
be
read
to
encompass
the
extended
period
when
appellate
processes
are
in
course.
i
suggest
it's
a
strain
reading
to
say
that
when
this
court
grant
certiorari
and
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
and
i
--
there
one
other
point
i
would
make
in
this
regard
again
is
that
--
it's
a
strange
result
if
the
military
in
fact
is
more
restricted
than
the
restraint
it
can
impose
pending
appeal
than
other
civilian
authorities
while
civilian
appeals
are
pending
because
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
but
my
point
here
is
that
where
in
the
civilian
system
whereas
i
believe
it's
correct
to
say
that
before
trial
the
only
reason
for
keeping
a
man
in
custody
is
to
assure
his
presence
following
a
conviction
and
pending
an
appeal
there
are
other
applicable
standards
in
the
statute
for
example
danger
to
the
community
and
things
like
that.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
if
it
applies
but
i
suggest
that
that
perhaps
startling
result
is
one
reason
why
13
should
not
be
so
read.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
captain
noyd's
air
force
career
has
in
fact
given
rise
to
a
number
of
difficult
questions
about
the
government
and
regulation
of
the
armed
forces.
mr.
karpatkin
enumerated
some
of
the
history
of
the
litigation
in
which
he
has
been
involved.
his
principle
claim
concerning
the
alleged
impropriety
and
the
denial
of
conscientious
objector
status
to
him
is
now
before
the
court
of
military
appeals.
it
may
well
return
to
the
civil
courts
and
it
may
well
return
here
but
those
questions
are
not
involved
in
the
case
that
is
here
now.
in
contrast,
this
case
involves
at
bottom
what
is
a
rather
narrow
and
highly
technical
question
of
military
penology.
the
nature
of
the
restraints
that
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice
permits
the
military
to
put
upon
a
serviceman
after
a
court-martial
conviction
and
while
he's
in
the
process
of
exhausting
his
military
rights
to
appeal.
fortuitously,
this
case
comes
here
with
captain
noyd
as
the
defendant
but
it
might
as
well
have
been
a
more
conventional
serviceman
charged
for
the
routine
military
offense
and
of
course
it's
important
to
recognize
that
the
legal
principles
for
which
the
petitioners
arguing
here
are
principles
that
would
apply
across
the
board
in
military
cases
to
any
military
defendant
whether
he
was
charged
with
desertion
or
murder
or
any
other
crime
that
could
appropriately
be
tried
by
a
court-martial.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
believe
not
in
the
code.
in
the
regulations,
there
are
certain
more
or
less
technical
distinctions
in
the
treatment
that
may
be
given
to
an
officer
as
distinguished
from
enlisted
man
at
any
particular
point.
this
of
course
arises
out
of
the
time
on
distinctions
that
have
existed
in
the
services
in
those
regards.
in
our
brief
and
in
our
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
the
general
applicability.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
throughout
the
air
force
and
of
course
throughout
all
the
services
because
it
is
a
uniform
code.
in
our
brief
and
in
our
submissions,
in
response
to
the
petition
for
certiorari,
we
have
raised
the
suggestion
that
this
case
may
have
become
moot
because
of
certain
technical
rules
in
the
code
relating
to
the
service
of
confinement
to
the
service
of
military
sentences
to
confinement.
i
would
suggest
unless
the
court
desires
otherwise
that
we
simply
refer
the
court
to
what
we
have
said
in
our
brief.
i
think
there's
a
little
more
that
can
be
said.
in
any
event,
there
seems
to
be
agreement
on
the
fact
that
at
the
most,
captain
noyd
has
two
days
remaining
to
serve
on
his
sentence
to
confinement.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
think
certainly
if
the
sentence
were
in
fact
suspended
mr.
justice
douglas
by
your
order.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
if
that
have
been
the
effect
i
think
it
would
certainly
follow
that
the
case
is
not
moot
and
there
are
two
days
remaining.
i
might
just
point
out
in
that
regard
that
a
recent
amendment
to
article
57
(b)
that
is
not
applicable
here
but
which
will
become
applicable
on
august
1st
of
this
year.
it
does
perhaps
cast
some
light
on
what
the
meaning
of
suspension
is.
that
amendment
for
the
first
time
introduces
something
approximating
bail
in
the
military
and
says
that
a
commanding
officer
may
defer
service
of
a
sentence
to
confinement.
and
the
sentence
in
the
existing
article
57
(b)
to
which
you
have
referred
mr.
justice
douglas
is
now
amended
to
read
effective
august
1,
1969
that
periods
during
which
the
sentence
to
confinement
is
suspended
or
deferred
shall
be
excluded
in
computing
the
service
of
the
term
of
confinement.
so
i
would
suggest
for
what
it's
worth
that
that
is
some
perhaps
after
the
fact
indication
by
congress
as
to
what
suspension
may
have
meant.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
that
that
the
release
from
confinement
is
not
tantamount
to
a
suspension
within
the
meaning
of

(b)
as
it
reads
effective
august
1,
1969
or
effective
in
noyd's
case.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
is
the
question,
why
should
the
man
be
in
confinement
while
he
is
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
well,
perhaps
i
have
to
break
that
down.
if
there
are
--
as
there
are
in
the
civilian
courts
of
course,
provisions
allowing
a
man
to
be
in
prison
or
in
confinement
pending
on
appeal.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
no
and
of
course
we're
not
suggesting
that
the
army
is
required
to
keep
him
in
prison.
basically,
our
position
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes.
is
that
act
in
the
case
of
the
civilian
trial,
there
is
discretion.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
well,
there
are
number
of
elements
that
could
go
in
to
the
commanding
officer's
exercise
to
this
discretion,
one
that
has
been
suggested
and
conceded
by
mr.
karpatkin
is
the
desire
to
avoid
flight.
there
are
--
well
the
bail
reform
act
of
1966
states
as
to
civilian
criminals
that
in
addition
to
that
reason
a
danger
to
the
community
maybe
(voice
overlap).
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
that
certainly
is
what
--
would
be
a
factor
to
go
into
the
military
commanding
officer's
discretion.
i
think
and
my
only
point
here
is
that
there
is
a
discretion,
well
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
well,
of
course,
he
has
at
the
most
two
days
mr.
justice
left
to
serve
on
his
sentence.
in
any
event,
he
has
been
under
an
obligation
to
the
service
to
stay
in.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
it
is
certainly
true
that
in
a
sense
it's
then
retroactively
no
reason
for
him
to
have
been
confined
while
his
appeal
was
pending.
of
course
the
--
it's
(voice
overlap)
to
which
civilian
criminals
are
also
subject.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
that's
correct
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes.
i
might
suggest
which
is
that
he
has
of
course
been
under
some
restraints.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
there
are
number
of
reasons
perhaps
there
are
peculiar
rules
about
the
computation
of
sentences
within
the
service,
pretend
there
are
no
concurrence
sentences.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes.
well,
i
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
this
maybe
an
element
of
equity
that
there
are
no
concurrent
sentences.
it
maybe
also
that
it
is
in
fact
i
think
probably
less
easy
to
be
released
on
--
to
be
relieved
for
serviceman
to
be
relieve
of
confinement
while
his
appeal
is
pending
under
the
rules
on
the
manual
court-martial
that
apply
here,
for
that
reason
it
maybe
appropriate
to
say
that
there
is
credit
in
fact.
i
must
say
that
this
is
a
question
of
judgment.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
no,
it
runs
one
way
or
another
and
of
course
there
are
these
technical
problems
as
to
what
is
confinement
and
what
is
not.
we
say
that
in
fact
the
status
in
which
captain
noyd
was
though
it
was
undoubtedly
unpleasant
to
him
and
restricted
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
whether
he
was
in
fact
confined
or
that
is
true
and
i
think
there's
no
question
in
whatever
that
that
whatever
the
reason
maybe
article
57
(b)
does
make
a
sentence
run.
no
matter
what
the
treatment
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
but
we
say
certainly
in
the
ordinary
case
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
not
in
restraint,
does
not,
is
clearly
not
amount
to
a
suspension.
now,
there
is
a
(voice
overlap)
different
question.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
he
was.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
could
not
be
executed
until
after
the
military
of
that
review
was
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
he
could
not
be
confined
at
hard
labor.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes.
i
suggest
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
serving
at
only
in
the
technical
sense
that
he
receives
credit
for
it
not
serving
in
any
--
in
the
sense
of
what
he
is
compelled
to
do.
we
do
not
derive
any
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
and
of
course
that
is
the
basis
of
our
mootness
argument
that
confinement
and
service
are
in
this
peculiar
code
we're
dealing
with
different
things.
we
have
also
urged
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
right
in
creating
the
merits
of
captain
noyd's
claim
is
improperly
before
the
civil
courts
because
of
his
failure
to
exhaust
the
remedy
in
the
military
courts
that
was
clearly
available
to
him
at
the
time
that
he
came
to
the
civil
courts.
this
is
an
important
point,
it's
one
i
would
like
to
return
to
but
i
think
perhaps
it
would
be
helpful
if
i
discuss
the
merits
even
though
we
have
two
reasons
for
saying
why
the
merits
should
not
be
reached.
i
think
it
perhaps
it
will
put
the
case
and
better
focus.
mr.
karpatkin's
argument,
at
least
orally,
rests
largely
upon
his
interpretation
of
article
71
(c)
of
the
code
which
is
the
provision
that
prohibits
the
execution
of
a
sentence
until
it
has
been
completely
reviewed
by
the
military
courts
and
in
the
case
of
an
officer
such
as
captain
noyd
by
the
service
secretary.
he
says
that
for
this
reason
the
order
directing
that
captain
noyd
be
sent
to
the
special
officer
facilities
at
for
leavenworth
was
an
improper
order.
i
think
the
first
thing
that
should
be
said
about
that
is
that
whatever
else
may
be
moot
in
this
case
certainly
the
order
sending
captain
noyd
purporting
to
send
captain
noyd
to
leavenworth
is
now
moot.
the
regulations
that
govern
such
matters
make
it
clear
that
no
man
can
be
sent
to
a
disciplinary
barracks
unless
he
has
six
months
remaining
to
serve
on
his
sentence.
now,
even
if
this
case
is
not
moot,
it
appears
to
be
a
great
that
there
are
only
two
days
left.
so,
for
that
reason,
i
think
that
the
leavenworth
order
which
has
been
suspended
is
ever
since
it
was
shortly
after
was
issued
by
the
order
of
the
district
court
and
to
stay
by
the
tenth
circuit
of
its
mandate.
i
would
suggest
that
that
order
is
not
as
a
practical
matter
in
issue
in
this
case.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
no,
mr.
justice.
the
district
court
said,
don't
send
him
to
leavenworth
but
do
whatever
else
you
want
this
tenth
circuit
reversed
that
and
said
that
the
case
should
not
have
been
entertained
but
has
state
its
mandate
pending
this
court's
action
so
that
order
has
remained
unfair.
in
any
event
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
no,
i
believe
not
as
technical
matter
mr.
justice
douglas.
there
have
been
certain
subsequent
orders
about
the
confinement
that
has
in
fact
taken
its
place.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
no,
it's
simply
by
operation
of
the
court's
order.
in
any
event,
we
would
suggest
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief
that
the
district
court's
disposition
of
the
leavenworth
order
reflected
either
a
misunderstanding
again
of
what
is
highly
technical
provision
in
the
military
law
as
to
what
execution
is
or
else
perhaps
in
this
matter
is
not
discussed
very
in
much
detail
in
the
district
court's
opinion,
a
misunderstanding
of
the
nature
of
the
confinement
to
which
captain
noyd
would
have
been
subjected
had
he
been
at
leavenworth.
there
are
in
fact
separate
facilities
with
very
separate
treatment
for
officers
awaiting
appeal,
they're
very
separate
and
different
from
the
facilities
and
treatment
they
are
given
to
regular
prisoners
at
leavenworth.
it
has
been
the
standard
practice
to
send
so-called
adjudged
officers
awaiting
appeal
to
leavenworth
rather
than
retaining
them
at
their
basis
because
of
the
special
problems
that
the
status
of
an
officer
creates
with
respect
to
restraints
on
his
base.
this
has
been
upheld
in
the
case
of
captain
levy
and
we
submit
that
it
was
not
an
abuse
of
discretion
or
an
execution
the
sentence
in
this
case.
but
as
i've
said,
i
don't
think
we
have
to
reach
the
leavenworth
order.
so
that
reduces
the
case
on
the
merits
if
the
merit
should've
been
reached
to
the
petitioner's
claim
that
the
restraint
to
which
he
was
subjected
at
cannon
air
force
base
where
he
has
been
stationed
at
the
pertinent
times
exceeded
what
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice
permits.
i
believe
it's
accurate
to
say
that
the
petitioner
concedes
that
some
restraint
of
a
convicted
person
and
convicted
officer
while
his
appeal
pending
is
permissible.
so
the
real
question
here
is
whether
the
restraint
that
was
imposed
upon
captain
noyd
by
his
arrest
in
quarters
was
a
proper
restraint.
the
answer
to
at
least
to
the
legal
principles
that
govern
the
question
of
the
restraint
that
is
allowed
require
the
locating
and
interpreting
of
a
number
of
different
provisions
of
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice
and
the
manual
for
courts-martial
which
of
course
is
an
executive
order
technically
of
the
president
and
of
course
has
the
force
of
law.
it
is
--
the
manual
is
promulgated
by
the
president
under
a
provision
of
the
uniform
code,
article
36
which
is
somewhat
like
the
rules
enabling
act
that
has
permitted
this
court
to
promulgate
the
rules
of
civil
and
criminal
procedure.
it's
the
direction
of
the
president
to
provide
for
the
procedure
in
cases
before
courts-martial.
now,
there
is
nothing
in
the
code
itself,
the
statutory
code
we
submit
that
that
speaks
expressly
to
the
question
of
restraint
of
a
convicted
prisoner
or
convicted
individual
while
his
appeal
is
pending.
but
there
are
certain
provisions
in
the
manual
which
do
speak
directly
to
this.
first,
is
article
--
is
paragraph
21
(d)
of
the
manual
which
provides
that
upon
notification
of
the
result
of
a
court-martial
trial
the
commanding
officer
of
the
defendant
in
that
trial
will
take
prompt
and
appropriate
action
with
respect
to
the
restraint
of
the
person
tried.
such
action,
and
i
continue
to
quote,
“depending
upon
the
circumstances
may
involve
the
immediate
release
of
the
person
from
any
restraint
or
the
imposition
of
any
necessary
restraint
pending
final
action
on
the
case.”
in
its
most
recent
statement
on
this
question
of
custody
pending
an
appeal
of
the
levy
case
some
two
years
ago,
the
court
of
military
appeals
held
that
although
there
is
no
such
thing
as
bail
in
the
sense
that
we
understand
it
in
the
military
system.
this
section
of
the
manual
does
give
the
commanding
officer
of
the
defendant
a
discretion
to
determine
what
custody
if
any
custody
is
appropriate
following
the
conviction.
and
the
court
of
military
appeals
in
that
levy
case
although
it
denied
captain
levy
release
made
it
very
clear
that
it
would
review
the
exercise
of
that
discretion
by
the
commanding
officer
involved
in
each
case
that
brought
to
it
on
habeas
corpus
and
would
reverse
the
commander's
action
if
the
discretion
was
abused.
the
first
step
of
review
of
a
court-martial
conviction
is
--
has
been
indicated
approval
by
the
commanding
--
by
the
convening
authority,
in
this
case
the
commander
of
the
twelfth
air
force
general
bond
and
there
are
provisions
--
there's
a
provision
relating
to
restraint
following
this
stage.
and
that
provision
is
paragraph
89
(c)
of
the
manual
for
courts-martial
that
directs
the
convening
authority
to
“provide
in
his
action
for
the
temporary
custody
of
the
accused
pending
final
disposition
of
the
case
upon
further
appellate
review
and
that
further
review
is
review
by
the
board
of
review
which
has
taken
place
in
this
case
and
by
the
court
of
military
appeals,
the
civilian
court
--
a
court
with
civilian
members
which
action
is
still
pending
in
captain
noyd's
case.”
one
other
provision
of
the
manual
relates
to
custody
pending
appeal
and
that
is
paragraph
18
(b)
(3)
of
the
manual
which
provides
that
no
punishment
other
than
restraint
imposed
in
accordance
with
regulations
may
be
imposed
upon
an
accused
while
his
appeal
is
pending.
we
think
it
is
clear
as
the
court
of
military
appeals
has
held
that
these
provisions
of
the
manual
issued
by
the
president
pursuant
to
statutory
authority
provide
a
basis
for
appropriate
restraint
pending
a
military
appeal.
now,
petitioner
contends
that
a
provision
of
the
code
does
in
fact
relate
to
this
article
13
which
says
that
the
arrest
or
confinement
of
a
person
“being
held
for
trial
or
the
result
of
trial
may
not
be
any
more
rigorous
than
the
circumstance
required
to
insure
his
presence.”
he
interprets
the
result
of
trial
to
include
appellate
review.
this,
we
think
is
wrong
if
nothing
else
in
light
of
the
caption
of
that
article
uniform
code
of
military
justice
which
says
punishment
prohibited
before
trial
and
in
fact
there
are
other
places
in
the
manual
whether
it
was
made
clear
that
the
result
of
the
trial
means
what
in
common
sense
term
you
would
think
it
was
me
the
result
of
the
trial
proceeding
itself
not
the
further
steps
of
appeal.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
suppose
result
of
trial
could
mean
while
the
jury
is
out
when
the
trial
proceeding
itself
is
over
and
you're
waiting
for
the
decision
that
will
result
from
that
trial
proceeding.
the
court-martial
was
still
in
progress
but
in
some
sense
the
trial
perhaps
may
be
over
it.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
in
any
event,
we
suggest
that
the
rule
for
which
petitioner
contends
in
this
interpretation
is
a
startling
one.
it
does
mean
that
in
the
military
despite
that
they
were
well
recognized
disciplinary
needs
of
the
military
a
convicted
serviceman
could
not
be
subjected
to
restraints
pending
appeal
that
are
allowed
in
the
case
of
a
civilian
prisoner
convicted
by
a
civilian
court
while
his
--
civilian
appeals
are
pending.
i
think
that
he
would
have
to
have
a
very
clear
statement
by
congress
that
this
was
truly
intended
before
we
should
accept
such
an
unusual
proposition.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
well,
i
was
going
to
say
i
don't
think
it
is
but
that
is
a
question,
a
question
is
what
--
the
question
at
this
point
is
what
are
the
legal
standards
that
should
be
applied
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
apart
from
mootness
and
apart
from
exhaustion,
i
think
the
question
is
whether
and
assuming
we
have
to
reach
the
merits,
the
question
is
whether
there
has
been
or
petitioner's
claim
is
really
that
there
has
been
an
abuse
of
discretion
in
determining
what
kind
of
restraint
is
appropriate.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
no,
but
he
is
entitled
to
a
reasonable
exercise
of
the
discretion
of
the
commanding
officers.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
on
this
point
mr.
justice
black,
i
confess
i
don't
see
a
difference
except
they
say
the
standard
is
different,
the
standard
is
the
article
13
standard
which
is
whether
this
a
risk
of
flight.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
would
certainly
say
that
is
what
the
case
when
you
boil
that
down
the
last
time
that
is
what
it
boils
down
to
and
on
that
of
course
we
would
say
that
it's
not
appropriate
for
civilian
court
at
least
on
the
facts
of
this
case
a
case
of
this
kind
to
review
that
discretion
of
the
military
officers.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
but
i
should
add
one
further
thing
and
this
gets
me
into
the
exhaustion
point.
that
discretion
is
reviewable
by
the
court
of
military
appeals
which
is
of
course
with
civilian
members
that
was
established
for
the
expressed
purpose
of
giving
a
kind
of
civilian
review
of
the
rights
of
serviceman.
that
court
has
a
supervisory
power
over
the
operation
of
military
justice
and
it's
a
power
that
it
has
articulated
itself
and
recognized
and
i
think
that
that
supervisory
power
gives
it
perhaps
a
good
deal
more
discretion
than
i
would
say
a
civilian
court
has.
a
good
deal
of
more
latitude
than
a
civilian
court
has
in
reviewing
the
discretion
of
the
military
officers.
i
think
this
court
has
recognized
that
its
supervisory
power
over
the
federal
criminal
justice
gives
that
good
deal
more
power
than
for
example
it's
more
strictly
legal
authority
over
state
of
criminal
justice.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
well,
in
this
case
--
well,
for
the
remedy
that
we
are
suggesting
here
habeas
corpus,
it
takes
no
longer
than
habeas
corpus
in
the
civilian
court
and
the
fact
that
is
what
happened
in
levy's
case.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
regular
review
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
would
say
yes
certainly
it's
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
well,
except
mr.
justice
marshall
and
this
is
the
military
remedy
to
which
we
really
point.
there
is
this
remedy
of
habeas
corpus
in
the
court
of
military
appeals
which
can
be
had
as
promptly
as
civilian
habeas
corpus.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
this
is
an
uncharted
area.
i
would
suggest
now
mr.
justice
marshall
that
just
and
perhaps
more
so
than
in
the
case
of
the
civilian
courts,
the
court
of
military
appeals
certainly
has
the
power
upon
receipt
of
a
petition
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
well,
i
think
perhaps
depending
on
as
in
any
case,
the
applications
of
a
lawyer
depend
upon
how
the
law
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
in
the
court
of
military
appeals?
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
think
there
have
been
relatively
few
this
far.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
because
that's
not
of
course
a
--
the
petition
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
but
i
suggest
that
there
is
no
reason
why
captain
noyd
could
not
have
file
such
a
petition
or
why
if
the
case
is
not
moot
he
could
not
file
such
a
petition
now.
i
think
he
can
get
more
relief
from
the
court
of
military
appeals
because
of
its
supervisory
power.
and
i
would
also
suggest
in
accordance
with
familiar
principles
of
exhaustion
of
remedies
and
other
where
areas
and
in
light
of
what
is
obviously
a
highly
technical
question
here
there
is
good
reason
why
the
expert
court
that
is
charged
with
working
out
these
matters
in
military
justice
should
ask
upon
them
before
a
civilian
court
is
asked
to
come
in
with
relatively
little
guidance
other
than
normally
the
guidance
that
civilian
counsel
can
give
it.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
it
was
--
of
the
order
of
nine
months
that
he
was
in
this
restrain
state
arrest
in
quarters.
of
course
if
assuming
that
he
had
gone
of
the
court
of
military
appeals
when
he
went
to
the
civilian
court,
he
could've
been
out
as
he
could've
been
in
the
case
of
a
civilian
habeas
corpus
within
the
matter
of
perhaps
a
week
or
two.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
well,
i
think
that
would
depend
upon
the
nature
of
the
question
that
he
raises.
mr.
karpatkin
has
referred
to
the
reid
and
covert
line
of
cases
where
the
claim
is
that
the
military
has
no
jurisdiction
to
try
this.
and
i
might
say
that
i
think
if
the
same
of
the
o'callahan
case
which
is
now
pending.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
if
it's
not
a
question
of
jurisdictional
power
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
well,
if
this
and
of
course
be
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
in
a
military
trial
or
in
here
has
not
in
the
trial
but
in
one
of
the
incidental
areas
related
to
trial.
we
would
suggest
that
the
position
is
the
same
as
to
exhaustion.
the
military
remedy
should
be
exhausted.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
certainly
mr.
justice,
the
civilian
court
would
have
jurisdiction
to
entertain
that
claim
as
to
whether
or
not
it
should
give
relief
we
would
suggest
that
the
old
standard
in
burns
and
wilson
is
still
the
standard
under
the
law
of
this
court
that
should
apply.
the
question
is
whether
or
not
the
military
courts
gave
fair
consideration
to
the
serviceman's
claim.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
certainly,
the
power
once
there
has
--
well,
the
power
exists
i
think
in
any
event,
i
think
the
case
should
not
be
entertained
as
a
matter
of
some
kind
of
judicial
discretion
and
there
has
not
been
exhaustion
when
there
has
been
exhaustion
clearly
there
is
power
and
let
it
just
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
find
it
difficult.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
find
it
difficult
to
concede
that
in
this
case
with
the
nature
of
the
claims
to
be
candid
that
there
would
be
any
room
left
for
civilian
court
to
do
any
thing
after
assuming
that
the
court
of
military
appeals.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
well,
of
course
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
well,
of
course
the
first
--
in
the
first
place
mr.
justice
douglas,
we
do
say
that
article
13
does
not
apply
to
the
post-conviction
period
pending
appeal.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
but
for
one
thing
looking
at
the
heading
of
that
section
where
it
says
no
punishment
before
trial.
we
suggest
that
that
provision
of
the
code
does
not
govern
the
period
when
appellate
review
is
pending.
in
any
event,
the
question
is
of
course
the
question
whether
or
not
discretion
was
abused
and
that
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes
but
i
say
it's
a
matter
of
discretion
with
the
appropriate
commander
to
determine
a
matter
reviewable
discretion.
of
course
to
determine
what
is
necessary
to
keep
this
prisoner
from
fleeing.
now,
for
example
in
the
case
of
captain
levy,
the
--
i
believe
the
district
court
in
kansas
has
held
that
has
reviewed
it
and
determined
that
that
was
a
permissible
exercise
of
discretion.
this
of
course,
in
light
of
the
fact,
that
the
man
was
an
officer
that
there
are
as
practical
matter
and
most
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
oh!
i'm
suggesting
that
the
words
as
a
result
of
trial
not
be
read
to
encompass
the
extended
period
when
appellate
processes
are
in
course.
i
suggest
it's
a
strain
reading
to
say
that
when
this
court
grant
certiorari
and
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
and
i
--
there
one
other
point
i
would
make
in
this
regard
again
is
that
--
it's
a
strange
result
if
the
military
in
fact
is
more
restricted
than
the
restraint
it
can
impose
pending
appeal
than
other
civilian
authorities
while
civilian
appeals
are
pending
because
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
but
my
point
here
is
that
where
in
the
civilian
system
whereas
i
believe
it's
correct
to
say
that
before
trial
the
only
reason
for
keeping
a
man
in
custody
is
to
assure
his
presence
following
a
conviction
and
pending
an
appeal
there
are
other
applicable
standards
in
the
statute
for
example
danger
to
the
community
and
things
like
that.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
if
it
applies
but
i
suggest
that
that
perhaps
startling
result
is
one
reason
why
13
should
not
be
so
read.
