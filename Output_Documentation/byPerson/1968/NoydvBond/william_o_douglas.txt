before
you
leave
that
question
counsel,
does
it
not
turn
on
the
last,
a
part
of
article
57
(b)
but
the
periods
during
which
the
sentence
to
confinement
is
suspended
shall
be
excluded

yes,
the

(voice

well,
if
57
(b),
why
not
earlier?
it
refers
to
the
suspension
of
a
sentence
to
confinement
and
that
suspension
without
sentence
to
confinement
told
that
the
length
of
the
term.
justice
william

douglas
well,
my
order
however
it
may
be
viewed
at
this
time
seems
on
the
face
to
address
itself
to
the
problem
of
confinement?
justice
william

douglas
it
wasn't
restored
after
the
district
court
order
was
vacated?
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
if
you
assume,
if
you
start
off
would
be
with
an
order
shipping
him
to
leavenworth
and
then
you
read
the
article
13
which
says
that
the
confinement
after
the
jury
or
after
the
trial
presumably
appending
exhaustion
shall
be
no
more
rigorous
than
the
circumstances
required
to
ensure
his
presence
beginning
to
deep
water,
don't
you?
justice
william
o.
douglas
because
sending
him
to
leavenworth
is
certainly
more
rigorous
than
what
is
needed
to
require
his
presence.

william

douglas
but
it
says
while
being
held
for
trial

the
result
of
trial.
justice
william

douglas
i
never
think
what
the
discretion
is
abused
whether
the
standard
to
ensure
his
presence
was
abused
if
13
apply?
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
do
you
suggest
that
13
(b)
read
as
if
it
did
not
include
the
words
or
the
result
of
trial?
justice
william
o.
douglas
(voice

it's
a
strain
reading
for
me
to
eliminate
or
from
article
13
the
result
of
trial.
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
to
insure
his
presence
has
the
flavor
of
our
bond
provision,
release
on
bond
and
recognizance
and
all
that
to
insure
his
presence.
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
curiously
13
combines
both.
justice
william

and
that's
what
his
counsel
says
technically
it's
still
in
effect.
