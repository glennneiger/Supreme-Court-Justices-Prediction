mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
essential
question
of
this
case
concerns
the
right
of
a
convicted
serviceman
to
a
meaningful
appeal.
more
specifically,
it
concerns
the
power
of
a
military
commander
to
order
the
immediate
confinement
of
a
serviceman
convicted
by
general
court-martial
and
sentenced
to
a
bad
conduct
dismissal
from
the
service
or
confinement
of
one
year
or
more
and
in
title
thereby
to
certain
valuable
appellate
rights
to
sentence
--
to
order
his
immediate
confinement
not
withstanding
the
explicit
provision
of
article
71
(c)
of
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice
which
prohibits
execution
of
such
sentences
prior
to
the
completion
of
military
appellate
review.
under
the
existing
practice
of
confinement,
pending
completion
of
appellate
review,
the
entire
sentence
may
be
served
prior
to
final
appellate
action
and
the
guaranteed
right
of
appeal
from
serious
convictions
in
the
military
will
be
rendered
meaningless.
the
military
and
the
government
assert
this
power
on
the
basis
of
an
overstrained
conceptual
distinction
between
confinement,
pending
completion
of
review
and
confinement
after
final
approval
of
sentence.
this
right
is
asserted
further
in
violation
of
military
law
without
regard
to
whether
or
not
confinement
is
necessary
to
ensure
the
prisoner's
presence
after
completion
of
appellate
review.
this
is
a
habeas
corpus
case
and
it
presents
the
question
of
a
power
to
confine
a
military
prisoner
prior
to
the
completion
of
military
review
in
two
contexts.
first,
the
power
to
confine
him
at
the
united
states
disciplinary
barracks
at
fort
leavenworth,
kansas,
a
maximum
security
institution.
and
second,
the
power
to
confine
in
a
unique
status
of
confinement
at
cannon
air
force
base,
new
mexico
which
was
especially
devised
with
petitioner
after
an
order
attempting
to
transfer
him
for
confinement
of
leavenworth
was
declared
unlawful
by
the
district
judge
in
new
mexico.
there
is
however
a
threshold
question
of
habeas
corpus
jurisdiction
raised
by
the
tenth
circuit's
reversal
of
the
district
court
on
grounds
of
alleged
failure
to
exhaust
military
remedies.
after
the
decision
of
the
tenth
circuit
when
certiorari
application
was
pending
in
this
court,
an
application
was
made
to
the
circuit
justice
for
release
from
confinement
pending
certiorari.
it
was
denied
first
by
the
circuit
justice,
further
application
was
made
in
mr.
justice
douglas
and
it
was
granted
on
december
24,
1968.
in
his
order,
granting
the
application
for
release
from
confinement
pending
certiorari,
mr.
justice
douglas
specified
two
issues
related
to
exhaustion.
first,
whether
the
doctrine
of
exhaustion
of
military
remedies
applies
where
the
habeas
corpus
petitioner
does
not
challenge
any
purported
error
in
the
court-martial
proceedings
themselves.
but
rather
whether
the
question
--
where
the
question
is
whether
the
court-martial
convening
authority,
in
this
case,
the
respondent
general
bond
acted
beyond
his
jurisdiction
in
attempting
to
order
confinement
prior
to
completion
of
military
appellate
review
and
violation
of
article
71
(c)
ucmj.
also
specified
by
mr.
justice
douglas
in
his
opinion
is
the
question
of
the
respective
scope
of
review
by
the
court
of
military
appeals
and
the
federal
courts
on
military
habeas
corpus
applications
of
this
nature.
it
is
necessary
to
state
the
facts
a
bit,
may
it
please
the
court
in
order
to
indicate
the
dimensions
of
the
problems
involved
in
this
case.
petitioner,
a
captain
in
the
air
force
was
convicted
by
a
general
court-martial
at
cannon
air
force
base
in
new
mexico
on
march
8,
1968
for
violation
of
article
90
of
the
ucmj.
he
was
accused
and
convicted
of
willful
disobedience
of
a
lawful
order.
the
order
he
was
convicted
of
violating
was
that
he
fly
an
instructional
mission
with
the
student
pilot
being
trained
for
combat
duty
in
vietnam.
the
principle
defense
which
was
sought
to
be
raised
of
general
court-martial
was
that
he
had
previously
applied
for
classification
as
a
conscientious
objector
and
either
separation
from
the
service
or
reassignment
to
duties
not
inconsistent
with
this
conscience
that
his
application
was
denied
because
of
an
error
of
law
on
the
part
of
the
secretary
of
the
air
force
and
those
officers
acting
in
the
name
of
the
secretary
of
the
air
force.
the
error
which
was
alleged
was
the
secretary's
denial
of
a
claim
because
captain
noyd
was
a
selective
conscientious
objector
and
not
a
universal
pacifist.
i
must
observed
that
even
though
this
issue
wasn't
before
the
court
that
this
is
not
a
wholly
frivolous
contention
as
demonstrated
by
the
recent
decision
of
judge
wyzanski
in
the
sisson
case
in
the
district
of
massachusetts
which
i
understand
the
solicitor
general
was
taking
a
direct
appeal
on
to
this
court.
however,
petitioner
was
unable
to
raise
that
defense
that
is
general
court-martial.
the
law
officer
held
that
the
general
court-martial
was
without
jurisdiction
and
the
board
of
review
which
heard
the
first
appeal
from
the
conviction
specifically
held
that
only
federal
courts
had
jurisdiction.
the
case
is
now
pending
in
the
court
of
military
appeals
and
will
be
argued
sometime
next
month.
the
criminal
proceedings
at
the
general
court-martial
and
the
futile
attempt
to
appeal
there
from
where
captain
noyd
second
unsuccessful
attempt
to
obtain
judicial
review
on
whether
the
secretary's
denial
of
his
conscientious
objector
application
was
lawful
or
unlawful.
the
prior
attempt
was
in
the
case
of
noyd
against
mcnamara
where
the
district
court
of
colorado
and
the
tenth
circuit
held
without
reaching
the
merits
that
they
were
jurisdictionally
barred
from
ruling
because
again
the
doctrine
of
exhaustion
of
military
remedies
barred
them,
they
so
held.
and
they
stated
further
and
the
government
so
argued
before
those
courts
that
whether
the
application
for
conscientious
objection
was
rightfully
or
wrongfully
denied
could
not
be
judicially
reviewed
in
the
civilian
courts
but
only
as
a
defense
to
a
court-martial.
and
involving
as
it
does
the
necessity
of
disobeying
an
order
and
raising
the
issue
was
wrongful
denial.
certiorari
was
denied
by
this
court
in
noyd
against
mcnamara
in
december
of
1967.
thus,
the
civilian
courts
directed
petitioner
to
raise
his
defense
in
the
military
courts
and
the
military
court
said
in
turn
that
only
the
civilian
courts
had
jurisdiction.
the
sentence
of
the
general
court-martial
imposed
march
9,
1968
was
for
dismissal
from
the
service
total
forfeiture
of
all
pay
and
allowances
and
one
year's
confinement
of
odd
labor.
on
that
day,
the
day
the
sentence
was
imposed,
petitioner
was
ordered
into
immediate
confinement
at
the
quarters
which
he
had
in
cannon
air
force
base
as
a
senior
captain
on
the
list
for
promotion
to
major
from
which
list
he
was
removed
after
he
filed
the
co
application.
he
was
entitled
to
reasonably
comfortable
officer's
residence
on
base
with
wife
and
two
infant
children.
on

1968,
the
convening

of
the
general
court-martial,
the
respondent

approved

status
of

in

residence.
both
sides
appeal
to
the
tenth
circuit.
early
in
june
of
1968
while
the
appeal
was
pending,
petitioner
and
his
family
were
evicted
from
their
residence
and
special
conditions
of
confinement
was
setup
for
petitioner.
he
was
ordered
to
move
to
a
room
specially
prepared
for
him
and
the
visiting
officers
quarters
and
conditions
were
established
which
i
can
best
characterize
as
being
a
hybrid
having
certain
characteristics
of
arrest,
certain
characteristics
of
imprisonment,
and
certain
characteristics
of
solitary
confinement.
it
was
arrest
in
that
or
at
least
had
resembled
arrest
in
that
and
there
was
no
lock
on
his
door
and
he
was
allowed
use
of
the
telephone
or
tv
set
of
his
expense.
it
was
imprisonment
and
that
all
of
his
activities
were
strictly
regulated.
he
was
subject
to
surveillance
by
air
force
security
police,
permitted
to
leave
his
room
for
meals,
chapel
or
laundry
but
only
under
condition
similar
to
those
where
by
a
penitentiary
prisoner
could
leave
his
cell
to
obtain
these
services
elsewhere
in
the
penitentiary
complex.
however,
it
also
had
certain
attributes
of
solitary
confinement
and
that
posted
on
his
door
was
a
huge
sign
“room
off
limits
to
military
personnel.”
he
was
not
permitted
to
have
exercise
except
for
one
and
a
half
hours
per
week
with
an
approved
officer
and
denied
the
opportunity
of
contact
with
other
human
beings,
fellow
prisoners
or
otherwise
which
even
inmates
of
the
disciplinary
barracks
unless
they
are
in
solitary
confinement.
this
unique
hybrid
status
continued
from
june
of
1968
to
december
24,
1968
when
he
was
ordered
release
from
confinement
by
order
of
mr.
justice
douglas.
in
the
interim,
the
board
of
review
affirmed
the
court-martial
conviction
and
the
tenth
circuit
reversed
the
district
court
of
new
mexico
in
this
habeas
corpus
proceeding.
the
tenth
circuit
did
not
consider
the
merits.
we
respectfully
suggest
by
the
citation
of
cases
in
footnote
4
of
its
opinion
which
is
printed
in
the
appendix.
it
appears
to
agree
with
petitioner's
position
that
71
(c)
was
violated.
the
tenth
circuit
held
however
that
it
was
jurisdictionally
barred
from
ruling
once
again
because
of
the
doctrine
of
exhaustion
of
military
remedy.
but
since
petitioner
is
in
confinement,
he
is
entitled
under
air
force
regulations
to
credit
for
good
time,
he
was.
a
one
year
sentence
less
good
time
was
computed
to
expire
on
the
26th
of
december
1968.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
mr.
justice
stewart,
the
sentence
doesn't
indeed
begin
to
run.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
yes,
but
apparently
it
took
a
special
ruling
from
the
judge
advocate
general
in
this
case
to
decide
that
captain
noyd
was
entitled
to
the
time
credit
and
i
believe
the
government
so
states
in
its
brief.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
we
contend
of
course
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
yes,
of
course.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
i
don't
know
what
position
the
government
would
take
on
that.
we
take
the
position
of
course
that
he
is
entitled
of
good
time.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
yes,
sir.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
all
that
i
can
say
to
that
your
honor
is
that
they
appears
to
be
nothing
specific
in
air
force
regulations
on
that
point
and
it
required
a
specific
rulings
form
the
judge
advocate
general.
consequently,
because
of
the
possibility
that
the
sentence
would
expire
with
good
time
allowance
prior
to
this
court's
action
on
the
certiorari
petition,
it
was
accompanied
by
release
application
to
avoid
the
possibility
of
mootness
and
i
stated
before
mr.
justice
douglas
on
december
24,
1968
granted
the
application.
in
response
to
the
certiorari
petition
however,
the
government
submitted
a
memorandum
suggesting
mootness
and
then
a
further
supplemental
memorandum
further
arguing
mootness
and
said,
nothing
whatsoever
in
our
position
to
the
merits
of
the
case.
however,
on
january
20,
1969,
certiorari
was
granted
and
mr.
justice
douglas'
stay
order
was
specifically
continued
by
this
court.
now,
it
is
hard
to
tell
if
the
government's
continuing
to
seriously
present
mootness
argument.
it
first
seemed
to
argue
in
the
two
memoranda
which
were
submitted
and
mr.
justice
douglas
was
without
power
to
interrupt
the
termination
of
the
sentence.
now,
apparently
it
concedes
that
mr.
justice
douglas
had
the
power
but
it
argues
what
that
it
is
unclear
whether
mr.
justice
douglas
intended
to
interrupt
the
sentence.
with
all
due
respect
i
suggest
that
argument
is
fatuous.
petition
is
concerned
about
mootness
was
made
very,
very
clear
and
the
release
applications
presented
at
first
to
mr.
justice
white
and
later
to
mr.
justice
douglas.
and
obviously,
the
members
of
the
court
who
read
it
were
aware
of
it.
now,
in
the
brief
presented
in
this
court,
the
government
position
is
somewhat
schizophrenic.
one
place
saying
that
it
is
moot,
in
other
place
saying
maybe
it
isn't
moot.
and
then
finally,
concluding
saying
it's
all
up
to
what
mr.
justice
douglas
intended
and
then
there
is
a
reference
to
the
decision
of
this
court
in
i.
l.
a.
against
philadelphia
marine
trade
which
reversed
the
contempt
order
because
in
accordance
with
the
decision
of
this
court.
it
was
unintelligible,
too
vague
to
be
understood
and
defies
comprehension.
i
respectfully
suggest
that
this
characterization
to
mr.
justice
douglas
is
ordered
by
the
government
is
completely
uncalled
for.
if
i
may
reach
the
preliminary
question
in
this
case,
the
question
of
exhaustion
of
military
remedies,
the
court
of
appeals
denied
relief
we
hold
improperly
on
grounds
of
the
legislative
exhaust
military
remedies.
the
decision
of
the
tenth
circuit
was
based
on
one
decision
of
this
court,
gusik
against
schilder
in
1950.
i
have
not
been
able
to
find
the
single
instance
where
the
doctrine
of
gusik
and
so
many
words
has
been
reaffirmed
by
this
court
since
then
and
it
has
apparently
however
been
held
inapplicable
in
military
habeas
corpus
cases
which
do
not
attack
court-martial
proceedings
per
se
but
rather
question
military
jurisdiction.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
that's
what
the
solicitor
general
argued.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
that
first
the
sentence
has
--
the
reply
is
twofold.
first,
that
any
justice
of
this
court
just
as
the
entire
court
has
the
right
to
interrupt
the
sentence
for
the
purpose
of
preventing
the
cause
from
becoming
moot
and
i
believe
the
government
concede
to
that
power
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
by
ordering
that
the
petitioner
be
released
from
confinement.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
57
(b),
your
honor,
article
57
(b)
does
however
provide
that
time
shall
not
be
credited
where
the
sentence
is
suspended.
now,
the
manual
for
court-martial
which
has
the
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
the
article
97
--
paragraph
97
(c)
of
the
manual
for
court-martial
which
appears
in
our
brief
sets
forth
a
series
of
circumstances
where
a
sentence
is
considered
suspended.
and
there
are
--
it
is
evident
from
the
text
of
the
language
itself
that
these
were
not
intended
to
be
an
exclusive
cataloging.
97
(c),
mr.
justice
fortas,
is
on
pages
6
and
7
of
petitioner's
brief.
now,
one
of
the
specifications
in
this
concededly
none
exhaustive
listing
is
period
during
which
the
person
undergoing
such
a
sentence
is
erroneously
released
from
confinement
upon
his
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
under
a
court
order
which
is
later
reversed
by
competent
tribunal
shall
be
excluded
in
computing
the
service
of
the
time
of
the
punishment.
the
--
if
i
may
proceed
with
the
argument
on
exhaustion,
the
--
there
is
great
significance
here
in
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
affirmed
by
this
court
and
the
case
of
united
states
ex
rel.
guagliardo
against
mcelroy.
it
was
specifically
held
there
that
the
rule
of
exhaustion
does
not
apply
where
military
jurisdiction
is
challenged.
petitioner
in
this
case
is
not
making
a
habeas
corpus
attack
on
the
many
errors
which
he
believes
occurred
in
the
court-martial.
he
is
content
to
exhaust
all
of
his
military
remedies
for
that
purpose.
habeas
corpus
here
is
sought
so
that
if
the
errors
are
redress
on
appeal
he
will
not
have
been
deprived
to
that
redress
by
intervening
confinement.
when
the
convening
authority,
the
respondent
general
bond
attempted
to
confine
captain
noyd
in
violation
of
article
71
(c),
we
contend
that
he
acted
beyond
his
jurisdiction.
he
certainly
had
jurisdiction
to
convene
a
court-martial
to
try
captain
noyd.
he
had
jurisdiction
to
confine
him
if
the
determination
was
made
that
it
restraint
was
necessary
to
insure
his
presence.
he
had
jurisdiction
to
confine
him
after
completion
of
appellate
review
but
he
was
totally
devoid
of
jurisdiction
to
confine
prior
to
the
completion
of
appellate
review.
if
i
may
respectfully
suggest
the
entire
doctrine
of
exhaustion
of
remedies
are
subject
to
continuing
reexamination
these
days.
because
of
it
sometimes
wouldn't
application
causes
rendering
--
renders
the
right
remediless.
as
this
court
observed
in
the
case
of
nlrb
against
marine
workers
as
a
result
of
the
region
application
of
the
doctrines
sometimes
the
litigant
becomes
exhausted
instead
of
the
remedies.
our
brief
cites
large
number
of
cases
where
courts
have
not
required
an
exhaustion
where
one,
the
imposer
of
sanctions
acted
beyond
his
jurisdiction.
two,
the
administrative
remedy
or
the
remedy
which
is
said
one
should
exhaust
is
inadequate
where
the
delay
of
the
exhaustion
process
would
cause
irreparable
injury
or
where
the
attempted
exhaustion
would
be
a
futility.
indeed,
if
i
may
respectfully
suggest
further
that
perhaps
the
entire
doctrine
of
exhaustion
of
remedies
arose
and
an
administrative
of
law
context
and
an
error
at
20,
30,
40
years
ago
when
there
was
an
atmosphere
of
administrative
omnipotence.
our
feeling,
i
believe
communicated
to
me
impart
when
i
went
to
law
school
that
all
of
the
nation's
problems
could
be
solved
by
administrative
agencies
and
the
administrative
process
and
let's
keep
the
courts
out.
but
now
on
a
sober
second
look,
the
courts
are
increasingly
recognizing
and
this
court
that
the
judicially
developed
doctrine
of
exhaustion
of
administrative
remedies
very
often
causes
injustice
and
must
be
disregarded
where
it
would
cause
in
justice.
with
specific
reference
to
the
suggested
remedies
by
the
--
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
below,
it
was
first
suggested
that
perhaps
the
normal
appellate
process
should
be
use.
for
the
normal
appellate
process
in
this
case
would
obviously
been
ineffective
because
of
a
laps
of
many
months
between
conviction
and
appellate
decisions.
we
cited
in
our
brief
a
number
of
cases
where
that
was
in
fact
the
case.
and
i
cited
that
just
on
a
review
generally
of
one
volume
of
a
court-martial
reports
many
cases
where
found
where
the
court
of
military
appeals
reverses
the
conviction
only
to
find
that
the
entire
time
of
confinement
has
already
been
served.
well,
it
was
suggested
that
an
extraordinary
writ
application
should
be
made
to
the
court
of
military
appeals.
we
suggest
that
this
is
an
inappropriate
for
number
of
reasons.
first,
of
all
the
court
of
military
appeals
which
only
recognize
that
it
had
such
jurisdiction
within
the
last
year
or
so
would
have
an
extraordinary
strain
placed
on
its
facilities.
it's
a
three-judge
appellate
tribunal
sitting
in
washington.
it
can
handle
only
a
handful
of
the
cases
that
are
presented
to
it
for
review.
if
it
was
the
court
of
original
and
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
military
habeas
corpus
applications
for
more
than
100
federal
districts
in
the
territorial
united
states
and
in
the
states
which
are
--
and
of
the
states
of
alaska
and
hawaii
and
the
territories
and
possessions
as
well
that
will
be
just
impossible
for
the
court
of
military
appeals
to
handle
such
a
law.
furthermore,
the
nature
of
habeas
corpus
as
this
court
instructed
in
johnson
against
eisentrager
requires
the
personal
presence
of
the
individual
of
the
habeas
hearing
would
obviously
be
impracticable
to
place
upon
the
military
of
this
requirement
of
producing
a
military
prisoner
in
washington
whenever
an
application
--
a
petition
for
writ
is
filed.
also,
there
will
be
grave
difficulties
in
the
face
of
military
prisoners
attempting
to
secure
counsel
to
represent
them
and
if
the
only
place
they
can
appear
is
the
court
in
washington
dc.
it's
hard
enough
for
a
serviceman
to
get
an
attorney
willing
to
bring
a
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
the
federal
district
court.
it
will
be
well
impossible
to
find
one
ready
willing,
able,
financially
equipped
to
come
to
washington.
then
with
respect
some
mention
maybe
made
of
the
hesitant
quality
of
the
practice
of
the
court
of
military
appeals
on
extraordinary
writ
applications.
although,
it
has
asserted
that
it
has
the
right
that
is
most
significant
that
it
is
not
yet
found
the
occasion
to
exercise
it.
obviously,
the
evolution
of
a
new
jurisdictional
base
takes
time
and
it's
only
to
be
welcome
that
the
court
of
military
appeals
is
asserted
that
it
has
its
right
but
it
would
certainly
be
ineffective
and
impracticable
to
say
that
if
this
time
in
history,
the
court
of
military
appeals
stands
ready
to
listen
to
and
grant
relief
and
habeas
corpus
applications
from
military
prisoners
all
over
the
country.
i
might
further
say
that
the
tenth
circuit's
narrow
jurisdictional
position
requiring
exhaustion
of
every
conceivable
military
remedy
has
caused
an
apparent
conflict
between
the
circuits.
the
decisions
of
the
tenth
circuit
in
noyd
against
mcnamara
and
noyd
against
bond
which
refuse
to
consider
the
merits
because
of
the
doctrine
of
exhaustion
of
military
remedies
are
directly
contrary
to
the
decisions
of
the
second
circuit
and
the
fifth
circuit
and
the
third
circuit
which
we
cite
in
our
brief.
furthermore,
there
are
large
number
of
cases
which
the
government
does
not
in
anyway
seek
to
explain
where
federal
courts
on
habeas
applications
did
not
require
application
to
the
court
of
military
appeals
but
ruled
on
the
merits.
the
government's
position
likewise
cast
doubt
on
the
recognized
practice
of
utilizing
habeas
corpus
without
any
requirement
of
exhaustion
in
the
court
of
military
appeals
to
test
the
validity
of
the
induction
order
and
also
the
validity
of
an
in-service
denial
of
conscientious
objector
claims
for
draftees
as
well
as
for
enlistees.
finally,
if
i
may
turn
to
the
merits
of
this
case
which
i
respectfully
suggest
present
as
clearer
cases
as
we
say
in
the
brief.
has
there
been
a
violation
of
article
71
(c)
in
this
case?
it
might
first
be
observed
that
we
are
not
attacking
the
military
process,
we're
not
attacking
the
military
appellate
process
by
any
means.
indeed,
we
regard
ourselves
as
the
champions
of
it.
our
position
supports
the
integrity
of
the
military
appellate
process
for
if
a
commanding
officer
can
effect
a
de
facto
execution
of
a
one
year
prison
sentence
prior
to
the
completion
of
the
military
appellate
process
in
direct
violation
of
an
act
of
congress,
the
integrity
of
the
appellate
process
is
serious
we
compromise
if
not
destroyed.
our
brief
traces
the
development
of
the
military
appellate
process
from
the
articles
of
war,
the
ucmj
in
1951
and
suggest
that
one
of
the
essential
elements
in
the
development
of
greater
rights
for
the
serviceman
is
the
development
of
further
and
more
refined
appellate
jurisdiction
that
the
history
--
part
of
the
history
of
increasing
due
process
has
been
the
providing
of
a
gap
of
a
space
between
the
court
of
first
instance,
between
the
original
action
and
final
review
by
a
higher
appellate
authority.
the
consistent
interpretation
of
article
71
(c)
which
we
have
catalogue
in
a
long
list
of
cases
in
our
brief
does
not
show
a
single
instance
where
the
government's
argument
that
it
can
confine
prior
to
the
completion
of
military
appellate
review
in
the
absence
of
necessity
to
secure
presence
and
the
government
cites
no
cases.
at
the
very
least,
judge
paine
in
the
district
of
new
mexico
was
right
when
he
held
that
confinement
of
leavenworth
would
in
effect
constitute
in
part
at
least
execution
of
the
sentence.
the
only
case
contrary,
the
decision
of
the
district
of
kansas
in
levy
against
dillon
is
a
contrary
interpretation
to
71
(c).
it
is
now
on
appeal
to
the
tenth
circuit,
we
respectfully
suggest
that
judge
paine
was
right
and
that
the
district
court
of
kansas
was
wrong.
a
distinction
is
attempted
to
be
made
by
the
government
between
the
treatment
of
adjudged
prisoners
whose
sentences
have
not
been
finally
approved
and
sentenced
prisoners
whose
sentences
have
been
finally
approved.
but
we
respectfully
suggest
that
the
air
force
manual
for
the
guidance
of
prisoners,
the
manual
applicable
to
the
institution
of
the
disciplinary
barracks
shows
no
significant
difference
whatsoever.
no
difference
in
treatment
of
male
all
of
which
is
subject
to
opening
an
inspection,
i
respectfully
suggest
there's
an
error
in
the
footnote
in
the
government's
brief,
no
differences
in
uniform
regulations,
no
differences
with
regard
to
visiting,
no
differences
with
regard
to
library
privileges
and
so
forth.
it
is
suggested
that
there
is
one
difference
and
that
adjudged
prisoner
is
not
compelled
to
work
but
the
manual
requires
that
they
be
encouraged
to
do
and
in
fact
most
of
them
do
so.
however,
even
if
there
is
a
difference
in
this
one
area,
the
essential
characteristics
of
confinement
in
a
maximum
security
military
prisoner
are
applied
equally
to
adjudged
and
sentenced
prisoners.
there
are
bars
in
the
windows,
there
is
control
of
hours
of
meals,
sleep
and
all
other
activities,
constant
surveillance
by
armed
guards,
restriction
of
reading
matter,
restriction
of
visitors
and
the
whole
host
of
other
specifications
in
the
leavenworth
manual
which
we
cited
in
our
brief.
i'll
save
what
time
i
have
remaining
for
rebuttal,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
should
first
observe
that
i
was
--
i
believe
reliably
informed
by
responsible
officer
in
the
judge
advocate
general's
department
of
the
air
force
that
the
air
force
still
regards
the
leavenworth
order
as
in
effect
and
that
they
are
not
and
that
they
do
not
believe
that
they
are
limited
by
the
six-month
proviso
for
service
of
the
--
for
service
of
time
at
leavenworth
because
it
applies
from
the
day
of
the
issuance
of
the
order.
i
don't
believe
that
they
would
practically
try
to
shift
captain
noyd
there
for
two
days
but
they
do
regard
the
order
as
being
in
legal
effect.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
yes,
the
--
i'm
surprised
that
the
solicitor
general's
recent
statement
because
it
seems
to
be
in
direct
conflict
with
words
in
his
brief.
referring
to
two
decisions
of
the
court
of
military
appeals,
the
cases
of
teague
and
(inaudible)
on
page
52
of
the
government's
brief
while
those
cases
do
find
express
statutory
support
in
article
13
for
imposing
conviction
restraint.
they
do
not
hold
that
the
permissible
grounds
for
pretrial
restraints
are
also
the
only
justification
for
post-trial
restraint.
i
believe
he's
coming
to
this
court
now
and
making
a
completely
different
argument.
now,
he
says
it
provides
no
basis
whatsoever
for
post-conviction
restraint.
i
think
that
what
we
have
here
is
an
assertion
by
the
government
of
raw
naked
power
to
imprison
a
convicted
prisoner
prior
to
the
completion
of
his
appellate
process
without
stating
any
justification
whatsoever.
there
was
no
return
to
the
petition
for
the
writ
here.
there
was
no
statement
by
the
government
of
any
desire
to
present
evidence.
no
attempt
was
made
to
show
that
the
conditions
of
captain
noyd's
confinement
at
any
time
either
at
leavenworth
or
anywhere
else
were
necessary
to
insure
his
presence
of
trial.
the
civilian
cases
which
are
cited
in
the
solicitor
general's
brief
involved
an
addition
to
insuring
presence
of
trial
where
an
appeal
was
frivolous
or
dilatory
or
like
in
the
carbo
case
where
the
substantial
probability
of
danger
to
witnesses.
now,
surely
nothing
like
that
is
even
remotely
involved
in
this
case.
the
government
in
effect
concedes
that
no
such
showing
could
be
made
and
indeed
no
such
showing
could
be
made.
the
prosecutor
at
the
trial
and
everybody
involved
in
captain
noyd's
tortuous
legal
proceedings
have
considered
from
beginning
to
the
end
his
excellent
character
and
sincerity
and
that
there
is
no
danger
of
his
doing
anything
of
the
nature
of
flight.
in
essence,
i
respectfully
suggest
the
government
is
arguing
that
there
was
a
right
to
preventative
detention
under
these
circumstances
even
without
any
showing
that
the
detention
is
necessary.
the
government
is
arguing
that
there
was
a
right
to
punish
without
an
offense
being
committed,
without
any
charge,
without
any
trial
and
without
any
conviction.
i
respectfully
suggest
that
this
process
which
is
apparently
been
going
on
in
the
military
for
many
years
where
just
automatically
somebody
has
sent
off
to
jail
as
soon
he's
convicted
regardless
of
his
appeals
that
finally
a
case
involving
this
issue
has
reached
this
honorable
court
and
that
this
i
respectfully
suggest
is
the
appropriate
time
for
this
court
to
advise
the
military
and
to
advise
the
population
that
not
only
can
the
military
not
violate
the
constitution
but
they
certainly
cannot
violate
their
own
uniform
code
of
military
justice
which
apparently
they
have
been
flagrantly
doing
for
the
last
15
years.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
essential
question
of
this
case
concerns
the
right
of
a
convicted
serviceman
to
a
meaningful
appeal.
more
specifically,
it
concerns
the
power
of
a
military
commander
to
order
the
immediate
confinement
of
a
serviceman
convicted
by
general
court-martial
and
sentenced
to
a
bad
conduct
dismissal
from
the
service
or
confinement
of
one
year
or
more
and
in
title
thereby
to
certain
valuable
appellate
rights
to
sentence
--
to
order
his
immediate
confinement
not
withstanding
the
explicit
provision
of
article
71
(c)
of
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice
which
prohibits
execution
of
such
sentences
prior
to
the
completion
of
military
appellate
review.
under
the
existing
practice
of
confinement,
pending
completion
of
appellate
review,
the
entire
sentence
may
be
served
prior
to
final
appellate
action
and
the
guaranteed
right
of
appeal
from
serious
convictions
in
the
military
will
be
rendered
meaningless.
the
military
and
the
government
assert
this
power
on
the
basis
of
an
overstrained
conceptual
distinction
between
confinement,
pending
completion
of
review
and
confinement
after
final
approval
of
sentence.
this
right
is
asserted
further
in
violation
of
military
law
without
regard
to
whether
or
not
confinement
is
necessary
to
ensure
the
prisoner's
presence
after
completion
of
appellate
review.
this
is
a
habeas
corpus
case
and
it
presents
the
question
of
a
power
to
confine
a
military
prisoner
prior
to
the
completion
of
military
review
in
two
contexts.
first,
the
power
to
confine
him
at
the
united
states
disciplinary
barracks
at
fort
leavenworth,
kansas,
a
maximum
security
institution.
and
second,
the
power
to
confine
in
a
unique
status
of
confinement
at
cannon
air
force
base,
new
mexico
which
was
especially
devised
with
petitioner
after
an
order
attempting
to
transfer
him
for
confinement
of
leavenworth
was
declared
unlawful
by
the
district
judge
in
new
mexico.
there
is
however
a
threshold
question
of
habeas
corpus
jurisdiction
raised
by
the
tenth
circuit's
reversal
of
the
district
court
on
grounds
of
alleged
failure
to
exhaust
military
remedies.
after
the
decision
of
the
tenth
circuit
when
certiorari
application
was
pending
in
this
court,
an
application
was
made
to
the
circuit
justice
for
release
from
confinement
pending
certiorari.
it
was
denied
first
by
the
circuit
justice,
further
application
was
made
in
mr.
justice
douglas
and
it
was
granted
on
december
24,
1968.
in
his
order,
granting
the
application
for
release
from
confinement
pending
certiorari,
mr.
justice
douglas
specified
two
issues
related
to
exhaustion.
first,
whether
the
doctrine
of
exhaustion
of
military
remedies
applies
where
the
habeas
corpus
petitioner
does
not
challenge
any
purported
error
in
the
court-martial
proceedings
themselves.
but
rather
whether
the
question
--
where
the
question
is
whether
the
court-martial
convening
authority,
in
this
case,
the
respondent
general
bond
acted
beyond
his
jurisdiction
in
attempting
to
order
confinement
prior
to
completion
of
military
appellate
review
and
violation
of
article
71
(c)
ucmj.
also
specified
by
mr.
justice
douglas
in
his
opinion
is
the
question
of
the
respective
scope
of
review
by
the
court
of
military
appeals
and
the
federal
courts
on
military
habeas
corpus
applications
of
this
nature.
it
is
necessary
to
state
the
facts
a
bit,
may
it
please
the
court
in
order
to
indicate
the
dimensions
of
the
problems
involved
in
this
case.
petitioner,
a
captain
in
the
air
force
was
convicted
by
a
general
court-martial
at
cannon
air
force
base
in
new
mexico
on
march
8,
1968
for
violation
of
article
90
of
the
ucmj.
he
was
accused
and
convicted
of
willful
disobedience
of
a
lawful
order.
the
order
he
was
convicted
of
violating
was
that
he
fly
an
instructional
mission
with
the
student
pilot
being
trained
for
combat
duty
in
vietnam.
the
principle
defense
which
was
sought
to
be
raised
of
general
court-martial
was
that
he
had
previously
applied
for
classification
as
a
conscientious
objector
and
either
separation
from
the
service
or
reassignment
to
duties
not
inconsistent
with
this
conscience
that
his
application
was
denied
because
of
an
error
of
law
on
the
part
of
the
secretary
of
the
air
force
and
those
officers
acting
in
the
name
of
the
secretary
of
the
air
force.
the
error
which
was
alleged
was
the
secretary's
denial
of
a
claim
because
captain
noyd
was
a
selective
conscientious
objector
and
not
a
universal
pacifist.
i
must
observed
that
even
though
this
issue
wasn't
before
the
court
that
this
is
not
a
wholly
frivolous
contention
as
demonstrated
by
the
recent
decision
of
judge
wyzanski
in
the
sisson
case
in
the
district
of
massachusetts
which
i
understand
the
solicitor
general
was
taking
a
direct
appeal
on
to
this
court.
however,
petitioner
was
unable
to
raise
that
defense
that
is
general
court-martial.
the
law
officer
held
that
the
general
court-martial
was
without
jurisdiction
and
the
board
of
review
which
heard
the
first
appeal
from
the
conviction
specifically
held
that
only
federal
courts
had
jurisdiction.
the
case
is
now
pending
in
the
court
of
military
appeals
and
will
be
argued
sometime
next
month.
the
criminal
proceedings
at
the
general
court-martial
and
the
futile
attempt
to
appeal
there
from
where
captain
noyd
second
unsuccessful
attempt
to
obtain
judicial
review
on
whether
the
secretary's
denial
of
his
conscientious
objector
application
was
lawful
or
unlawful.
the
prior
attempt
was
in
the
case
of
noyd
against
mcnamara
where
the
district
court
of
colorado
and
the
tenth
circuit
held
without
reaching
the
merits
that
they
were
jurisdictionally
barred
from
ruling
because
again
the
doctrine
of
exhaustion
of
military
remedies
barred
them,
they
so
held.
and
they
stated
further
and
the
government
so
argued
before
those
courts
that
whether
the
application
for
conscientious
objection
was
rightfully
or
wrongfully
denied
could
not
be
judicially
reviewed
in
the
civilian
courts
but
only
as
a
defense
to
a
court-martial.
and
involving
as
it
does
the
necessity
of
disobeying
an
order
and
raising
the
issue
was
wrongful
denial.
certiorari
was
denied
by
this
court
in
noyd
against
mcnamara
in
december
of
1967.
thus,
the
civilian
courts
directed
petitioner
to
raise
his
defense
in
the
military
courts
and
the
military
court
said
in
turn
that
only
the
civilian
courts
had
jurisdiction.
the
sentence
of
the
general
court-martial
imposed
march
9,
1968
was
for
dismissal
from
the
service
total
forfeiture
of
all
pay
and
allowances
and
one
year's
confinement
of
odd
labor.
on
that
day,
the
day
the
sentence
was
imposed,
petitioner
was
ordered
into
immediate
confinement
at
the
quarters
which
he
had
in
cannon
air
force
base
as
a
senior
captain
on
the
list
for
promotion
to
major
from
which
list
he
was
removed
after
he
filed
the
co
application.
he
was
entitled
to
reasonably
comfortable
officer's
residence
on

with
wife
and
two
infant
children.

to

from

then
status
of
arrest
in
his
residence.
both
sides
appeal
to
the
tenth
circuit.
early
in
june
of
1968
while
the
appeal
was
pending,
petitioner
and
his
family
were
evicted
from
their
residence
and
special
conditions
of
confinement
was
setup
for
petitioner.
he
was
ordered
to
move
to
a
room
specially
prepared
for
him
and
the
visiting
officers
quarters
and
conditions
were
established
which
i
can
best
characterize
as
being
a
hybrid
having
certain
characteristics
of
arrest,
certain
characteristics
of
imprisonment,
and
certain
characteristics
of
solitary
confinement.
it
was
arrest
in
that
or
at
least
had
resembled
arrest
in
that
and
there
was
no
lock
on
his
door
and
he
was
allowed
use
of
the
telephone
or
tv
set
of
his
expense.
it
was
imprisonment
and
that
all
of
his
activities
were
strictly
regulated.
he
was
subject
to
surveillance
by
air
force
security
police,
permitted
to
leave
his
room
for
meals,
chapel
or
laundry
but
only
under
condition
similar
to
those
where
by
a
penitentiary
prisoner
could
leave
his
cell
to
obtain
these
services
elsewhere
in
the
penitentiary
complex.
however,
it
also
had
certain
attributes
of
solitary
confinement
and
that
posted
on
his
door
was
a
huge
sign
“room
off
limits
to
military
personnel.”
he
was
not
permitted
to
have
exercise
except
for
one
and
a
half
hours
per
week
with
an
approved
officer
and
denied
the
opportunity
of
contact
with
other
human
beings,
fellow
prisoners
or
otherwise
which
even
inmates
of
the
disciplinary
barracks
unless
they
are
in
solitary
confinement.
this
unique
hybrid
status
continued
from
june
of
1968
to
december
24,
1968
when
he
was
ordered
release
from
confinement
by
order
of
mr.
justice
douglas.
in
the
interim,
the
board
of
review
affirmed
the
court-martial
conviction
and
the
tenth
circuit
reversed
the
district
court
of
new
mexico
in
this
habeas
corpus
proceeding.
the
tenth
circuit
did
not
consider
the
merits.
we
respectfully
suggest
by
the
citation
of
cases
in
footnote
4
of
its
opinion
which
is
printed
in
the
appendix.
it
appears
to
agree
with
petitioner's
position
that
71
(c)
was
violated.
the
tenth
circuit
held
however
that
it
was
jurisdictionally
barred
from
ruling
once
again
because
of
the
doctrine
of
exhaustion
of
military
remedy.
but
since
petitioner
is
in
confinement,
he
is
entitled
under
air
force
regulations
to
credit
for
good
time,
he
was.
a
one
year
sentence
less
good
time
was
computed
to
expire
on
the
26th
of
december
1968.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
mr.
justice
stewart,
the
sentence
doesn't
indeed
begin
to
run.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
yes,
but
apparently
it
took
a
special
ruling
from
the
judge
advocate
general
in
this
case
to
decide
that
captain
noyd
was
entitled
to
the
time
credit
and
i
believe
the
government
so
states
in
its
brief.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
we
contend
of
course
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
yes,
of
course.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
i
don't
know
what
position
the
government
would
take
on
that.
we
take
the
position
of
course
that
he
is
entitled
of
good
time.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
yes,
sir.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
all
that
i
can
say
to
that
your
honor
is
that
they
appears
to
be
nothing
specific
in
air
force
regulations
on
that
point
and
it
required
a
specific
rulings
form
the
judge
advocate
general.
consequently,
because
of
the
possibility
that
the
sentence
would
expire
with
good
time
allowance
prior
to
this
court's
action
on
the
certiorari
petition,
it
was
accompanied
by
release
application
to
avoid
the
possibility
of
mootness
and
i
stated
before
mr.
justice
douglas
on
december
24,
1968
granted
the
application.
in
response
to
the
certiorari
petition
however,
the
government
submitted
a
memorandum
suggesting
mootness
and
then
a
further
supplemental
memorandum
further
arguing
mootness
and
said,
nothing
whatsoever
in
our
position
to
the
merits
of
the
case.
however,
on
january
20,
1969,
certiorari
was
granted
and
mr.
justice
douglas'
stay
order
was
specifically
continued
by
this
court.
now,
it
is
hard
to
tell
if
the
government's
continuing
to
seriously
present
mootness
argument.
it
first
seemed
to
argue
in
the
two
memoranda
which
were
submitted
and
mr.
justice
douglas
was
without
power
to
interrupt
the
termination
of
the
sentence.
now,
apparently
it
concedes
that
mr.
justice
douglas
had
the
power
but
it
argues
what
that
it
is
unclear
whether
mr.
justice
douglas
intended
to
interrupt
the
sentence.
with
all
due
respect
i
suggest
that
argument
is
fatuous.
petition
is
concerned
about
mootness
was
made
very,
very
clear
and
the
release
applications
presented
at
first
to
mr.
justice
white
and
later
to
mr.
justice
douglas.
and
obviously,
the
members
of
the
court
who
read
it
were
aware
of
it.
now,
in
the
brief
presented
in
this
court,
the
government
position
is
somewhat
schizophrenic.
one
place
saying
that
it
is
moot,
in
other
place
saying
maybe
it
isn't
moot.
and
then
finally,
concluding
saying
it's
all
up
to
what
mr.
justice
douglas
intended
and
then
there
is
a
reference
to
the
decision
of
this
court
in
i.
l.
a.
against
philadelphia
marine
trade
which
reversed
the
contempt
order
because
in
accordance
with
the
decision
of
this
court.
it
was
unintelligible,
too
vague
to
be
understood
and
defies
comprehension.
i
respectfully
suggest
that
this
characterization
to
mr.
justice
douglas
is
ordered
by
the
government
is
completely
uncalled
for.
if
i
may
reach
the
preliminary
question
in
this
case,
the
question
of
exhaustion
of
military
remedies,
the
court
of
appeals
denied
relief
we
hold
improperly
on
grounds
of
the
legislative
exhaust
military
remedies.
the
decision
of
the
tenth
circuit
was
based
on
one
decision
of
this
court,
gusik
against
schilder
in
1950.
i
have
not
been
able
to
find
the
single
instance
where
the
doctrine
of
gusik
and
so
many
words
has
been
reaffirmed
by
this
court
since
then
and
it
has
apparently
however
been
held
inapplicable
in
military
habeas
corpus
cases
which
do
not
attack
court-martial
proceedings
per
se
but
rather
question
military
jurisdiction.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
that's
what
the
solicitor
general
argued.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
that
first
the
sentence
has
--
the
reply
is
twofold.
first,
that
any
justice
of
this
court
just
as
the
entire
court
has
the
right
to
interrupt
the
sentence
for
the
purpose
of
preventing
the
cause
from
becoming
moot
and
i
believe
the
government
concede
to
that
power
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
by
ordering
that
the
petitioner
be
released
from
confinement.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
57
(b),
your
honor,
article
57
(b)
does
however
provide
that
time
shall
not
be
credited
where
the
sentence
is
suspended.
now,
the
manual
for
court-martial
which
has
the
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
the
article
97
--
paragraph
97
(c)
of
the
manual
for
court-martial
which
appears
in
our
brief
sets
forth
a
series
of
circumstances
where
a
sentence
is
considered
suspended.
and
there
are
--
it
is
evident
from
the
text
of
the
language
itself
that
these
were
not
intended
to
be
an
exclusive
cataloging.
97
(c),
mr.
justice
fortas,
is
on
pages
6
and
7
of
petitioner's
brief.
now,
one
of
the
specifications
in
this
concededly
none
exhaustive
listing
is
period
during
which
the
person
undergoing
such
a
sentence
is
erroneously
released
from
confinement
upon
his
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
under
a
court
order
which
is
later
reversed
by
competent
tribunal
shall
be
excluded
in
computing
the
service
of
the
time
of
the
punishment.
the
--
if
i
may
proceed
with
the
argument
on
exhaustion,
the
--
there
is
great
significance
here
in
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
affirmed
by
this
court
and
the
case
of
united
states
ex
rel.
guagliardo
against
mcelroy.
it
was
specifically
held
there
that
the
rule
of
exhaustion
does
not
apply
where
military
jurisdiction
is
challenged.
petitioner
in
this
case
is
not
making
a
habeas
corpus
attack
on
the
many
errors
which
he
believes
occurred
in
the
court-martial.
he
is
content
to
exhaust
all
of
his
military
remedies
for
that
purpose.
habeas
corpus
here
is
sought
so
that
if
the
errors
are
redress
on
appeal
he
will
not
have
been
deprived
to
that
redress
by
intervening
confinement.
when
the
convening
authority,
the
respondent
general
bond
attempted
to
confine
captain
noyd
in
violation
of
article
71
(c),
we
contend
that
he
acted
beyond
his
jurisdiction.
he
certainly
had
jurisdiction
to
convene
a
court-martial
to
try
captain
noyd.
he
had
jurisdiction
to
confine
him
if
the
determination
was
made
that
it
restraint
was
necessary
to
insure
his
presence.
he
had
jurisdiction
to
confine
him
after
completion
of
appellate
review
but
he
was
totally
devoid
of
jurisdiction
to
confine
prior
to
the
completion
of
appellate
review.
if
i
may
respectfully
suggest
the
entire
doctrine
of
exhaustion
of
remedies
are
subject
to
continuing
reexamination
these
days.
because
of
it
sometimes
wouldn't
application
causes
rendering
--
renders
the
right
remediless.
as
this
court
observed
in
the
case
of
nlrb
against
marine
workers
as
a
result
of
the
region
application
of
the
doctrines
sometimes
the
litigant
becomes
exhausted
instead
of
the
remedies.
our
brief
cites
large
number
of
cases
where
courts
have
not
required
an
exhaustion
where
one,
the
imposer
of
sanctions
acted
beyond
his
jurisdiction.
two,
the
administrative
remedy
or
the
remedy
which
is
said
one
should
exhaust
is
inadequate
where
the
delay
of
the
exhaustion
process
would
cause
irreparable
injury
or
where
the
attempted
exhaustion
would
be
a
futility.
indeed,
if
i
may
respectfully
suggest
further
that
perhaps
the
entire
doctrine
of
exhaustion
of
remedies
arose
and
an
administrative
of
law
context
and
an
error
at
20,
30,
40
years
ago
when
there
was
an
atmosphere
of
administrative
omnipotence.
our
feeling,
i
believe
communicated
to
me
impart
when
i
went
to
law
school
that
all
of
the
nation's
problems
could
be
solved
by
administrative
agencies
and
the
administrative
process
and
let's
keep
the
courts
out.
but
now
on
a
sober
second
look,
the
courts
are
increasingly
recognizing
and
this
court
that
the
judicially
developed
doctrine
of
exhaustion
of
administrative
remedies
very
often
causes
injustice
and
must
be
disregarded
where
it
would
cause
in
justice.
with
specific
reference
to
the
suggested
remedies
by
the
--
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
below,
it
was
first
suggested
that
perhaps
the
normal
appellate
process
should
be
use.
for
the
normal
appellate
process
in
this
case
would
obviously
been
ineffective
because
of
a
laps
of
many
months
between
conviction
and
appellate
decisions.
we
cited
in
our
brief
a
number
of
cases
where
that
was
in
fact
the
case.
and
i
cited
that
just
on
a
review
generally
of
one
volume
of
a
court-martial
reports
many
cases
where
found
where
the
court
of
military
appeals
reverses
the
conviction
only
to
find
that
the
entire
time
of
confinement
has
already
been
served.
well,
it
was
suggested
that
an
extraordinary
writ
application
should
be
made
to
the
court
of
military
appeals.
we
suggest
that
this
is
an
inappropriate
for
number
of
reasons.
first,
of
all
the
court
of
military
appeals
which
only
recognize
that
it
had
such
jurisdiction
within
the
last
year
or
so
would
have
an
extraordinary
strain
placed
on
its
facilities.
it's
a
three-judge
appellate
tribunal
sitting
in
washington.
it
can
handle
only
a
handful
of
the
cases
that
are
presented
to
it
for
review.
if
it
was
the
court
of
original
and
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
military
habeas
corpus
applications
for
more
than
100
federal
districts
in
the
territorial
united
states
and
in
the
states
which
are
--
and
of
the
states
of
alaska
and
hawaii
and
the
territories
and
possessions
as
well
that
will
be
just
impossible
for
the
court
of
military
appeals
to
handle
such
a
law.
furthermore,
the
nature
of
habeas
corpus
as
this
court
instructed
in
johnson
against
eisentrager
requires
the
personal
presence
of
the
individual
of
the
habeas
hearing
would
obviously
be
impracticable
to
place
upon
the
military
of
this
requirement
of
producing
a
military
prisoner
in
washington
whenever
an
application
--
a
petition
for
writ
is
filed.
also,
there
will
be
grave
difficulties
in
the
face
of
military
prisoners
attempting
to
secure
counsel
to
represent
them
and
if
the
only
place
they
can
appear
is
the
court
in
washington
dc.
it's
hard
enough
for
a
serviceman
to
get
an
attorney
willing
to
bring
a
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
the
federal
district
court.
it
will
be
well
impossible
to
find
one
ready
willing,
able,
financially
equipped
to
come
to
washington.
then
with
respect
some
mention
maybe
made
of
the
hesitant
quality
of
the
practice
of
the
court
of
military
appeals
on
extraordinary
writ
applications.
although,
it
has
asserted
that
it
has
the
right
that
is
most
significant
that
it
is
not
yet
found
the
occasion
to
exercise
it.
obviously,
the
evolution
of
a
new
jurisdictional
base
takes
time
and
it's
only
to
be
welcome
that
the
court
of
military
appeals
is
asserted
that
it
has
its
right
but
it
would
certainly
be
ineffective
and
impracticable
to
say
that
if
this
time
in
history,
the
court
of
military
appeals
stands
ready
to
listen
to
and
grant
relief
and
habeas
corpus
applications
from
military
prisoners
all
over
the
country.
i
might
further
say
that
the
tenth
circuit's
narrow
jurisdictional
position
requiring
exhaustion
of
every
conceivable
military
remedy
has
caused
an
apparent
conflict
between
the
circuits.
the
decisions
of
the
tenth
circuit
in
noyd
against
mcnamara
and
noyd
against
bond
which
refuse
to
consider
the
merits
because
of
the
doctrine
of
exhaustion
of
military
remedies
are
directly
contrary
to
the
decisions
of
the
second
circuit
and
the
fifth
circuit
and
the
third
circuit
which
we
cite
in
our
brief.
furthermore,
there
are
large
number
of
cases
which
the
government
does
not
in
anyway
seek
to
explain
where
federal
courts
on
habeas
applications
did
not
require
application
to
the
court
of
military
appeals
but
ruled
on
the
merits.
the
government's
position
likewise
cast
doubt
on
the
recognized
practice
of
utilizing
habeas
corpus
without
any
requirement
of
exhaustion
in
the
court
of
military
appeals
to
test
the
validity
of
the
induction
order
and
also
the
validity
of
an
in-service
denial
of
conscientious
objector
claims
for
draftees
as
well
as
for
enlistees.
finally,
if
i
may
turn
to
the
merits
of
this
case
which
i
respectfully
suggest
present
as
clearer
cases
as
we
say
in
the
brief.
has
there
been
a
violation
of
article
71
(c)
in
this
case?
it
might
first
be
observed
that
we
are
not
attacking
the
military
process,
we're
not
attacking
the
military
appellate
process
by
any
means.
indeed,
we
regard
ourselves
as
the
champions
of
it.
our
position
supports
the
integrity
of
the
military
appellate
process
for
if
a
commanding
officer
can
effect
a
de
facto
execution
of
a
one
year
prison
sentence
prior
to
the
completion
of
the
military
appellate
process
in
direct
violation
of
an
act
of
congress,
the
integrity
of
the
appellate
process
is
serious
we
compromise
if
not
destroyed.
our
brief
traces
the
development
of
the
military
appellate
process
from
the
articles
of
war,
the
ucmj
in
1951
and
suggest
that
one
of
the
essential
elements
in
the
development
of
greater
rights
for
the
serviceman
is
the
development
of
further
and
more
refined
appellate
jurisdiction
that
the
history
--
part
of
the
history
of
increasing
due
process
has
been
the
providing
of
a
gap
of
a
space
between
the
court
of
first
instance,
between
the
original
action
and
final
review
by
a
higher
appellate
authority.
the
consistent
interpretation
of
article
71
(c)
which
we
have
catalogue
in
a
long
list
of
cases
in
our
brief
does
not
show
a
single
instance
where
the
government's
argument
that
it
can
confine
prior
to
the
completion
of
military
appellate
review
in
the
absence
of
necessity
to
secure
presence
and
the
government
cites
no
cases.
at
the
very
least,
judge
paine
in
the
district
of
new
mexico
was
right
when
he
held
that
confinement
of
leavenworth
would
in
effect
constitute
in
part
at
least
execution
of
the
sentence.
the
only
case
contrary,
the
decision
of
the
district
of
kansas
in
levy
against
dillon
is
a
contrary
interpretation
to
71
(c).
it
is
now
on
appeal
to
the
tenth
circuit,
we
respectfully
suggest
that
judge
paine
was
right
and
that
the
district
court
of
kansas
was
wrong.
a
distinction
is
attempted
to
be
made
by
the
government
between
the
treatment
of
adjudged
prisoners
whose
sentences
have
not
been
finally
approved
and
sentenced
prisoners
whose
sentences
have
been
finally
approved.
but
we
respectfully
suggest
that
the
air
force
manual
for
the
guidance
of
prisoners,
the
manual
applicable
to
the
institution
of
the
disciplinary
barracks
shows
no
significant
difference
whatsoever.
no
difference
in
treatment
of
male
all
of
which
is
subject
to
opening
an
inspection,
i
respectfully
suggest
there's
an
error
in
the
footnote
in
the
government's
brief,
no
differences
in
uniform
regulations,
no
differences
with
regard
to
visiting,
no
differences
with
regard
to
library
privileges
and
so
forth.
it
is
suggested
that
there
is
one
difference
and
that
adjudged
prisoner
is
not
compelled
to
work
but
the
manual
requires
that
they
be
encouraged
to
do
and
in
fact
most
of
them
do
so.
however,
even
if
there
is
a
difference
in
this
one
area,
the
essential
characteristics
of
confinement
in
a
maximum
security
military
prisoner
are
applied
equally
to
adjudged
and
sentenced
prisoners.
there
are
bars
in
the
windows,
there
is
control
of
hours
of
meals,
sleep
and
all
other
activities,
constant
surveillance
by
armed
guards,
restriction
of
reading
matter,
restriction
of
visitors
and
the
whole
host
of
other
specifications
in
the
leavenworth
manual
which
we
cited
in
our
brief.
i'll
save
what
time
i
have
remaining
for
rebuttal,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
should
first
observe
that
i
was
--
i
believe
reliably
informed
by
responsible
officer
in
the
judge
advocate
general's
department
of
the
air
force
that
the
air
force
still
regards
the
leavenworth
order
as
in
effect
and
that
they
are
not
and
that
they
do
not
believe
that
they
are
limited
by
the
six-month
proviso
for
service
of
the
--
for
service
of
time
at
leavenworth
because
it
applies
from
the
day
of
the
issuance
of
the
order.
i
don't
believe
that
they
would
practically
try
to
shift
captain
noyd
there
for
two
days
but
they
do
regard
the
order
as
being
in
legal
effect.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
yes,
the
--
i'm
surprised
that
the
solicitor
general's
recent
statement
because
it
seems
to
be
in
direct
conflict
with
words
in
his
brief.
referring
to
two
decisions
of
the
court
of
military
appeals,
the
cases
of
teague
and
(inaudible)
on
page
52
of
the
government's
brief
while
those
cases
do
find
express
statutory
support
in
article
13
for
imposing
conviction
restraint.
they
do
not
hold
that
the
permissible
grounds
for
pretrial
restraints
are
also
the
only
justification
for
post-trial
restraint.
i
believe
he's
coming
to
this
court
now
and
making
a
completely
different
argument.
now,
he
says
it
provides
no
basis
whatsoever
for
post-conviction
restraint.
i
think
that
what
we
have
here
is
an
assertion
by
the
government
of
raw
naked
power
to
imprison
a
convicted
prisoner
prior
to
the
completion
of
his
appellate
process
without
stating
any
justification
whatsoever.
there
was
no
return
to
the
petition
for
the
writ
here.
there
was
no
statement
by
the
government
of
any
desire
to
present
evidence.
no
attempt
was
made
to
show
that
the
conditions
of
captain
noyd's
confinement
at
any
time
either
at
leavenworth
or
anywhere
else
were
necessary
to
insure
his
presence
of
trial.
the
civilian
cases
which
are
cited
in
the
solicitor
general's
brief
involved
an
addition
to
insuring
presence
of
trial
where
an
appeal
was
frivolous
or
dilatory
or
like
in
the
carbo
case
where
the
substantial
probability
of
danger
to
witnesses.
now,
surely
nothing
like
that
is
even
remotely
involved
in
this
case.
the
government
in
effect
concedes
that
no
such
showing
could
be
made
and
indeed
no
such
showing
could
be
made.
the
prosecutor
at
the
trial
and
everybody
involved
in
captain
noyd's
tortuous
legal
proceedings
have
considered
from
beginning
to
the
end
his
excellent
character
and
sincerity
and
that
there
is
no
danger
of
his
doing
anything
of
the
nature
of
flight.
in
essence,
i
respectfully
suggest
the
government
is
arguing
that
there
was
a
right
to
preventative
detention
under
these
circumstances
even
without
any
showing
that
the
detention
is
necessary.
the
government
is
arguing
that
there
was
a
right
to
punish
without
an
offense
being
committed,
without
any
charge,
without
any
trial
and
without
any
conviction.
i
respectfully
suggest
that
this
process
which
is
apparently
been
going
on
in
the
military
for
many
years
where
just
automatically
somebody
has
sent
off
to
jail
as
soon
he's
convicted
regardless
of
his
appeals
that
finally
a
case
involving
this
issue
has
reached
this
honorable
court
and
that
this
i
respectfully
suggest
is
the
appropriate
time
for
this
court
to
advise
the
military
and
to
advise
the
population
that
not
only
can
the
military
not
violate
the
constitution
but
they
certainly
cannot
violate
their
own
uniform
code
of
military
justice
which
apparently
they
have
been
flagrantly
doing
for
the
last
15
years.
thank
you
very
much.
