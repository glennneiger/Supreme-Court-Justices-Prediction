ms.
anna
r.
lavin
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
assistant
solicitor
general
made
the
statement
that
the
seizure
of
this
money
did
not
disadvantage
mr.
angelini.
i
must
immediately
reply
that
it
certainly
did
disadvantage
mr.
angelini.
mr.
angelini,
they
did
go
to
jail
and
this
money
was
the
main
evidence
against
him.
he
also
said
the
money
belongs
to
we
know
not
whom.
i
submit
that
that
is
fairly
well
ignoring
the
record.
mr.
angelini
claimed
this
money
under
oath
as
owner
and
that
was
never
put
into
contest.
it
was
conceited
--
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
yes,
sir?
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
oh,
yes.
yes
sir.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
for
this
violation
under
4411
and
4412
--
7203
or
7302
for
this
particular
operation,
the
sportsman's
park
operation,
arising
out
of
this
arrest
--
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
he
was
convicted
of
willful
failure
to
file
under
4412
and
willful
failure
to
pay
--
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
that
conviction
has
already
been
served.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
yes,
sir.
i
might
say
also
that
that
the
assistant
solicitor
general
yesterday
overlooked
that
aside
from
the
fine
of
$2,500.00
and
the
60
days
in
jail,
he
also
was
given
the
3-year
probationary
period.
(voice

ms.
anna
r.
lavin
this
would
not
have
had,
no.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
that's
true,
yes
sir.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
i
don't
think
it
does
either.
i
guess
what
--
i
just
want
to
point
out
that
there
has
been
some
disadvantaged
and
the
fact
of
his
conviction
was
argued
yesterday.
i
might
say
in
regard
to
the
proof
on
this
libel,
there
was
a
showing
that
he
hadn't
filed
under
4411
and
under
the
first
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
which
affirmed
the
forfeiture.
they
said
this
amount
of
cash
justified
the
inference
that
he
was
in
the
bookmaking
business.
this
they
termed
as
the
ready
cash
theory,
though
he
was
not
shown
to
have
taken
any
of
that
money
as
wagers
on
the
day
that
he
was
arrested.
no
wagers
were
seen
being
taken
by
him.
he
paid
out
no
money
in
response
to
collection,
the
very
wagers.
when
this
court
vacated
the
decision
of
the
seventh
circuit
--
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
that's
true.
i'm
talking
about
this
particular
trial,
this
particular
trial.
when
this
court
reversed
and
remanded
for
reappraisal
of
this
forfeiture
in
the
light
of
marchetti
and
grosso,
their
court
reversed,
finding
that
this
forfeiture
or
what
develops
into
a
forfeiture,
mr.
angelini
was
a
given
a
choice
between
self-incrimination
and
forfeiture
of
property
and
the
seventh
circuit
found
that
it
was
impermissible.
it's
of
course
clear
that
the
obligation
to
register
and
pay
the
occupational
tax
under
the
marchetti
case
was
recognized
as
creating
real
and
appreciable
hazards
to
self-incrimination.
i
submit
the
question
here
is
whether
mr.
angelini
forfeits
his
property
for
failing
to
assume
those
assets
and
for
refusal
actually
to
waive
his
constitutional
privilege.
the
government
of
course
argues
that
it
should
on
several
grounds.
the
government
in
its
brief
--
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
and
for
refusing
to
register.
this
court
recognized
in
the
marchetti
case
that
you
couldn't
do
one
without
the
other.
if
you
offer
to
pay
the
tax,
they
wouldn't
take
it.
internal
revenue
wouldn't
take
it
unless
you
registered
and
incriminated
yourself
or
ask
what
where
obviously
incriminatory
question,
certainly
under
illinois
law
as
well
as
most
states
in
the
united
states.
i
think
it's
interesting
that
the
government
in
its
argument
actually
resisted
on
the
application
boyd
to
this
case.
yet,
almost
from
the
inception,
the
argument
here
yesterday,
the
government
relied
on
boyd
as
authorizing
seizure
of
these
moneys.
last
night,
i
went
to
boyd
and
studied
it
very
carefully.
i
wanted
to
determine
what
was
the
source
of
this
argument
that
was
made
yesterday.
i
could
only
find
a
possible
reference
at
page
623
of
the
boyd
opinion
where
the
court
was
detailing
antecedent
history.
in
considering
the
statute
that
made
it
mandatory
upon
order
of
court
for
a
man
to
deliver
his
private
books
and
papers
to
determine
whether
or
not
he
had
paid
the
proper
duties,
the
supreme
court
in
boyd
said
even
the
obnoxious
writs
of
assistance
didn't
go
this
far.
they
said,
there
when
they
entered
into
warehouses,
unto
ships,
they
at
least
were
looking
for
stolen
property
or
property
which
no
duty
had
been
paid.
this
they
said
was
not
as
bad
as
what
the
contested
statute
in
boyd
did.
however,
that
court
was
not
endorsing
writs
of
assistance.
it
was
merely
say
that
this
statute
was
even
worse
than
that.
it
was
saying
that
writs
of
assistance
is
obnoxious
as
they
were,
were
not
compelling
a
man's
testimony
against
himself
out
of
his
own
mouth.
at
least
according
to
the
boyd
case,
the
writs
of
assistance
allowed
search
for
well,
what
was
actually
contraband.
and
in
that
sense,
they
weren't
as
bad
as
the
--
a
compelling
a
self-incrimination
by
a
person's
prior
papers.
but
as
i
said
--
private
papers
--
but
as
i
say,
they
were
not
endorsing
searches
in
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment,
nor
can
the
government
here
convert
the
words
from
boyd
into
an
endorsement
of
violation
of
the
fifth.
the
government's
invocation
of
boyd
yesterday
on
argument,
i
submit,
is
both
time-wise
inappropriate
and
content-wise
inappropriate.
it
is
clear
i
think
from
our
argument
that
we
rely
on
boyd
and
submit
to
this
court
that
the
decision
of
the
seventh
circuit
can
only
be
reversed
if
boyd
is
overruled
and
abandoned.
the
government
proposes
to
this
court
that
this
forfeiture
is
remedial
and
not
punitive.
i'm
not
really
entirely
sure
i
understand
this
argument.
i
wasn't
sure
when
i
receive
the
brief.
if
as
i
think
it
does,
punitive
means
punishment
for
a
wrong,
then
remedial
as
used
here
would
seem
to
mean
to
compensate
for
a
wrong.
if
that's
the
argument,
i
submit
to
this
court,
it
must
be
rejected.
the
occupational
tax,
this
as
the
court
knows,
$50.00.
the
forfeiture
here
is
over
$8,600.00.
it
would
seem
that
the
sheer
discrepancy
between
the
amounts
would
defeat
the
argument.
but
even
if
that
does
not
happen,
i
think
the
practicalities
of
the
matter
should.
this
$50.00
tax
and
the
penalties
and
the
interest
that
accrue
on
it
have
already
been
assessed
independently
by
the
government
and
they
have
been
collected.
the
government's
own
actions
and
--
an
independent
assessment
in
collection
reject
the
possibility
that
the
seizure
here
is
compensatory
rather
than
punitive.
i
submit
they
are
clearly
punitive
and
therefore
they
are
quasi
criminal
contrary
to
what
the
government
proposes.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
yes,
i
understood
that
(voice
overlap)
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
i
understood
that
to
be
another
fair
argument
mr.
justice.
i
understood
their
argument
to
say
that
this
is
remedial
and
not
punitive.
this
is
a
manner
of
taking
offending
articles
out
of
circulation.
i
understand
that
the
third
argument
is
its
in
rem
and
you
can't
avail
yourself
of
the
personal
privilege
of
the
claimant.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
well,
that's
precise
--
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
that's
precisely
what
our
answer
to
it
would
be,
that
theory
of
removal
of
this
offending
property
from
circulation.
money
certainly
isn't
offending.
certainly,
it
doesn't
offend
me
and
i
cannot
conceive,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
government
has
admitted,
they
have
no
intention
of
taking
it
out
of
circulation.
slot
machines,
roulette
wheels,
those
are
taken
out
of
circulation
and
destroyed;
that's
not
going
to
happen
to
this
money.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
yes,
sir?
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
yes
sir,
that's
the
excise
tax.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
you
understand
mr.
justice
brennan
that
there
was
no
proof
that
this
money
was
paid
as
wagers,
so
the
10%
could
not
attach
those
instances
where
in
this
masquerade
on
sportsman's
park
prove
have
been
shown
that
wagers
had
been
taken
by
these
men.
that
10%
tax
has
been
assessed.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
yes,
sir.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
no.
i
don't
mind
if
i
represent
it,
some
of
them
i
do
but
i
--
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
yes,
sir.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
oh,
no
that's
strictly
on
4411
and
4412,
4401
doesn't
come
into
it.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
i
didn't
see
the
government's
argument
resting
on
mitchell.
i
noticed
that
mitchell
was
cited
three
times
in
the
brief.
it
was
not
expanded
upon.
i
was
somewhat
surprise
this
morning
to
find
that
that
was
their
principle
area
of
reliance.
you're
talking
now
of
compensating
the
united
states
for
the
cost
of
its
investigation?
is
that
the
--
the
solicitor
general
argued
that
this
morning.
it
was
him
who
argued
in
the
brief.
i
was
totally
unprepared
for
it,
but
i
would
submit
that
this
is
not
a
very
learned
argument
coming
at
somewhat
as
rather
surprised
that
this
really
personal
for
the
cost
of
investigation
appears
to
have
no
equality,
the
case
that
follows
this
is
we
have
to
say
300,000
compensatory
for
the
cost
of
investigation.
here
for
some
reason,
8,600
is
compensatory
for
the
cost
of
investigation
under
their
argument.
it
--
rather
what
surprises
me
that
in
criminal
cases,
where
cost
of
investigations
of
this
type
are
made
at
least
have
never
been
assessed
as
valid
cost,
and
i
don't
see
how
validly
these
monies
can
be
seize
and
say
were
compensating
the
government
for
the
use
of
their
agents
or
whatever
it
might
be.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
$2,500.00.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
that
could
help.
as
to
their
in
rem
argument,
the
government
has
argued
that
subject
--
property
subject
to
forfeiture
enjoys
no
privilege
against
self-incrimination
which
can
be
asserted
to
prevent
their
forfeiture.
they
say
that
this
is
an
in
rem
proceeding
brought
against
the
property
itself
and
it
may
not
avail
itself
of
the
owner's
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
we
submit
to
this
court
that
this
argument
was
refused
long
ago
in
the
boyd
case,
which
rejected
any
argument
that
the
technical
character
of
a
forfeiture
as
an
in
rem
proceeding
against
the
property
had
any
effect
on
the
right
of
the
owner
of
the
property
to
assert
as
a
defense
violation
of
his
constitutional
rights,
and
the
court
recognized
this
owner
--
the
court
in
boyd
recognized
the
owner
as
a
substantial
party
to
the
in
rem
suit,
and
therefore
in
a
position
to
raise
violations
of
his
constitutional
rights.
i
might
say
at
this
time
that
the
case
on
which
--
well
which
the
united
states
urged
was
in
conflict
with
this
case,
wherein
the
deans
are
claimants
in
its
something
against
a
19
something.
their
case
differs
substantially
in
this
regard.
here,
we
have
a
man
who
is
recognized
as
an
owner
by
the
trial
court.
the
boyd
case
says
as
an
owner
recognized
is
a
substantial
party
and
has
right
to
raise
his
constitutional
rights.
i
think
it's
very
important
to
recognize
that
in
the
dean
case,
the
trial
court
found
that
the
deans
the
claimants
were
not
the
owners
of
the
property.
therefore
actually,
the
deans
would
have
no
standing
in
that
lawsuit.
their
claim
as
owner
was
rejected
by
the
findings
of
the
court.
i
think
that's
a
substantial
difference
between
their
case
and
this
and
i
thought
i
would
like
to
bring
it
to
the
court's
attention.
there
is
one
basic
difference,
i
might
say,
while
we
rely
on
boyd,
i
mean
we
rely
on
plymouth.
there's
a
basic
difference
between
those
cases
and
this
one
at
bar.
in
those
cases,
the
typical
point
was
the
prohibition
in
choosing
in
a
forfeiture
case,
evidence
illegally
assert
--
secured
from
the
owner.
here,
we
have
kind
of
the
other
side
of
the
coin.
we
--
they
claim
forfeiture
of
property
because
the
owner
refused
or
omitted
to
give
evidence
against
himself
in
violation
of
his
constitutional
rights,
because
if
he
had
waived
his
constitutional
rights,
there
would
be
no
forfeiture
here.
the
rational
of
this
forfeiture
action
is
the
--
the
forfeiture
of
property
for
invoking
the
constitutional
privilege,
and
i
submit
to
this
of
course
in
the
true
sense
of
the
word,
this
makes
the
constitutional
privilege
what
has
been
used
so
often,
this
makes
it
cost.
the
government
makes
a
further
argument
that
in
the
abstract,
an
owner
could
be
entirely
innocent
of
any
wrongdoing
or
illegality
and
the
property
would
still
be
subject
to
forfeiture.
and
in
the
abstract,
that
can
be
true.
but
here,
necessary
to
forfeiture
is
the
illegal
intent
of
the
possessor,
and
this
court
in
one
1958
plymouth
versus
pennsylvania
made
that
eminently
clear
the
difference
between
properties
that
are
forfeitable
per
se
and
properties
that
require
proof
of
the
use
in
order
for
them
to
become
forfeitable.
now,
and
it
pointed
out
that
when
dealing
with
articles
that
are
innocent
as
themselves
as
the
money
is
here,
the
articles
derive
their
contraband
nature
only
from
the
acts
or
the
intent
of
the
possessor
or
user.
the
act
of
the
intent
of
mr.
angelini
which
is
necessary
to
make
this
property
subject
to
forfeiture
is
first
the
operation
of
a
wagering
business
which
is
not
illegal
under
federal
law,
and
secondly,
the
failure
to
comply
with
the
registration
provisions
of
4412
and
the
payment
of
the
$50.00
under
4411.
to
have
on
the
act,
it
would
under
marchetti
require
that
he
incriminate
himself.
it
is
our
submission
most
basically
that
no
illegal
intent
can
be
inferred
from
the
exercise
of,
or
a
refusal
to
waive
constitutional
rights.
it's
our
position
that
property
can't
assume
a
contraband
nature
from
such
exercise
or
refusal
by
the
possessor.
and
if
it
can't
derive
a
contraband
nature
from
the
acts
or
intent
of
the
possessor,
it's
not
contraband
and
it
is
therefore
not
subject
to
forfeiture
because
the
proof
necessary
to
the
derivative
forfeiture
has
failed.
i
submit
therefore
that
none
of
the
government's
arguments
are
going
to
suffice
to
forfeit
these
goods.
i
submit
that
the
decision
of
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
should
be
affirmed.
we
then
come
to
the
aspect
of
this
case
that
was
not
presented
to
the
seventh
circuit.
this
is
the
urging
by
the
government
of
strict
prospective
application
of
the
marchetti-grosso
decisions
in
forfeiture
cases
if
this
court
should
determine
that
they
applied
forfeiture
cases.
i
would
also
submit
to
this
court
on
that
point
that
the
government
has
made
no
argument
to
encourage
this
court
validly
to
employ
strict
prospective
application.
its
own
cases
and
i
refer
particularly
to
the
case
that
most
relies
on
linkletter
recognized
that
the
general
rule
is
retroactive
application.
it
also
recognized
an
exception
to
that
rule
where
a
decision,
an
earlier
decision
is
overruled
as
this
court
by
marchetti-grosso
overruled
character
in
louis.
that
rule
is
that
intermediate
cases
finally
decided
should
not
be
upset.
this
case
of
course
is
not
finally
decided.
this
standard
of
limited
applicability
refer
to
by
this
court
in
linkletter
as
being
appropriate
to
a
circumstance
such
as
we
have
here
is
not
even
considered
by
the
government
on
this
argument.
it
doesn't
enlighten
us
what
if
any
havoc
would
ensue
where
the
marchetti-grosso
decisions
made
applicable
to
forfeiture
cases
or
how
they
would
it
upset
the
administration
of
justice.
they
give
us
no
countervailing
considerations
which
this
court
recognized
were
necessary
to
strict
application
of
prospective
application
that
would
take
this
case
out
of
the
limited
retroactivity
rule.
the
government's
whole
argument
relates
to
the
potentialities
of
a
volume
of
litigation
relating
to
property
forfeited
in
the
past,
finally
forfeited,
and
they
say
that
provides
a
sound
and
practical
reason
for
this
court
to
apply
prospective
application.
it
pays
no
attention
to
cases
not
finally
decided
such
as
this.
it
gives
no
reason
by
this
court
to
not
declare
limited
retroactivity
in
accordance
with
the
rule
pronounced
in
linkletter.
we
submit
the
rule
should
be
employed
to
cases
such
as
this
and
finally
decided
and
we
further
submit
that
no
countervailing
considerations
have
been
suggested
by
the
government
for
not
employing
that
rule.
and
some
then,
if
the
court
please,
we
submit
to
--
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
there
was
a
month
long
surveillance
at
sportsman's
park.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
early
in
the
month
of
august
of
1963,
he
had
been
seen
talking
--
oh,
there
was
one
occasion
where
a
man
came
up
to
him
and
said
something
like
tantamount
of
work,
one
occasion
in
the
month.
he
was
seen
receiving
money
from
bookmakers
who
were
convicted
or
who
pleaded
guilty
and
he
was
seen
giving
the
money,
but
not
within
a
week
of
this
particular
day.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
yes,
according
to
the
evidence,
yes
sir.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
well,
i
don't
really
know
that,
but
i
would
suggest
that
they
were
getting
better
at.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
and
he
didn't
know
in
the
racetrack
either.
oh,
there
is,
oh
yes.
there
was
evidence
of
that
too.
they
were
able
to
give
credit
betting
and
you
can't
get
credit
betting
at
the
pari-mutuel
window.
i
have
nothing
further
unless
there
are
some
questions.
thank
you.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
i
already
explained
to
your
honor
that
i
wasn't
unprepared
for
that.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
i
don't
think
mitchell
applies
if
the
case
stands
for
what
i
understood
from
the
oral
argument
because
it
sets
no
standard.
how
could
one
person
be
well
hurt
to
the
extent
of
maybe
$300,000.00
as
we
have
in
the
sixth
circuit
case
in
8600
here
or
moreover?
the
purpose
of
agents
is
for
the
most
part
to
investigate
criminal
activities.
i
have
never
seen
and
i
don't
believe
there
is
any
basis
or
any
incidents
where
investigative
processes
have
been
recognize
as
an
assessable
cost
and
i
suggest
on
that
account
and
i
admit
it's
kind
of
off
the
top
of
my
head
that
i
can't
see
where
it
could
logically
be
applied
as
a
reason
for
forfeiting
these
moneys.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
well,
i
have
no
problem
with
individual
deeds
having
criminal
and
civil
problems,
but
i
--
or
sanctions,
but
i
do
say
that
what
is
inadmissible
in
a
--
for
the
purposes
of
a
criminal
sanction
is
certainly
inadmissible
for
the
purposes
of
the
civil
sanction.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
i
think
that's
what
makes
it
bad.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
as
i
think
this
court
in
marchetti
clearly
asks
the
congress
to
adjust
this
statute.
i
think
if
i
interpret
your
decision
correctly,
you
are
asking
for
immunity.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
that's
right.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
i
think
its
quasi
criminal.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
yes.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
yes,
sir.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
lavin.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
yes
sir.
if
it
please
the
court,
i
don’t
--
counsel
made
a
factual
mistake
and
i
don’t
know
that
it
has
any
real
significance,
but
i
think
we
may
as
well
dispose
of
it,
so
we
will
at
least
recognize
that
there
is
no
fourth
amendment
question
in
this
case.
counsel
stated
that
a
search
was
made
of
mr.
angelini’s
person
at
the
time
of
his
arrest,
it
developed
that
there
was
some
$8,600.00
on
this
person.
actually,
the
money
was
revealed
at
the
time
he
went
through
the
ordinary
processing
at
the
united
states
marshall’s
office
on
a
request
to
empty
his
pockets
as
all
persons
taken
into
custody
are.
the
money
was
not
seized
at
the
race
track
as
counsel
indicated.
as
i
say,
i
don’t
think
it’s
a
matter
of
great
consequence
one
way
or
another.
mr.
justice
blackmun
asked
about
cases
remanded
at
the
same
time
as
was
this
case.
i
point
out
that
not
one
to
my
knowledge
in
that
one
has
the
government
requested
certiorari
where
the
--
we
had
a
criminal
matter
involved.
they
however
have
made
a
distinction
in
this
case
because
it
concerns
forfeiture.
i
think
that
there
is
no
distinction
between
a
criminal
conviction
and
a
forfeiture
proceeding.
i
think
that
marchetti
and
grosso
apply
equally
to
both.
the
announced
object
of
this
court
in
deciding
marchetti
and
grosso
was
the
protest
or
rather
the
protection
of
the
individual
against
self-incrimination
under
the
comprehensive
system
of
federal
and
state
prohibitions
against
wagering
activities.
in
malloy
versus
hogan,
this
court
said
in
part
that
the
fifth
amendment
secures
the
right
of
a
person
to
remain
silent
unless
he
wishes
to
speak
in
the
unfettered
exercise
of
his
own
will
and
to
suffer
no
penalties.
in
spevack
versus
klein,
again,
this
court
emphasized
that
penalties
used
in
the
context
of
the
malloy
case
is
not
restricted
to
fine
or
imprisonment;
that
it
means
any
sanction
that
makes
assertion
of
the
privilege
is
in
the
word
this
court
did
costly,
and
we
have
the
spevack,
disbarment,
(inaudible)
loss
of
job,
the
young
lady
who
lost
her
position
as
a
teacher
whose
name
i
don’t
now
remember.
so
i
suggest
to
the
court,
if
marchetti
and
grosso
have
retroactive
effect,
a
question
that
has
not
until
right
now
to
my
knowledge
was
brought
up
so
far
as
criminality
is
concerned,
then
it
has
retroactive
effect
so
far
as
forfeiture
proceedings
are
concerned.
i
would
like
to
address
myself
just
in
passing
to
the
mackey
case
because
that
was
also
a
product
of
questioning
by
the
court.
the
seventh
circuit
stated
that
its
distinction
between
mackey
and
the
earlier
case
of
lookretis
which
was
remanded
by
this
court,
a
criminal
gambling
prosecution,
though
under
1952,
the
distinction
it
made
was
that
mackey
did
not
involved
gambling
offenses,
it
being
an
income
tax
evasion
case.
later,
the
second
circuit
in
--
i
mean,
the
seventh
circuit
in
even
a
more
recent
case
decided
on
september
9,
1970,
zizzo
versus
the
united
states
in
reversing
zizzo
said
we
distinguish
this
from
mackey
because
mackey
did
not
come
within
the
object
of
the
supreme
court
when
they
said
they
wanted
to
protect
a
privilege
against
self-incrimination
where
local
and
state
gambling
statutes
were
concerned.
that’s
the
distinction
the
seventh
circuit
makes
and
i
submit
to
this
court
that
it’s
a
valid
one.
now,
counsel
here
has
indicated
that
this
court
has
recognized
in
certain
instances
boyd
is
not
a
deterrent
to
the
--
well,
to
implement
error,
interpretation
of
constitutional
rights.
i
might
say
that
when
any
--
whenever
this
court
has
held
--
so
spoken
it
has
spoken
in
regard
to
sixth
amendment
rights
and
has
expressly
omitted
from
consideration
any
fifth
amendment
rights
which
it
has
always
considered
pervasive.
the
government
opines
here
before
this
court
that
marchetti-grosso
applies
prospectively.
i
assume
that
the
government
uses
the
standards
that
this
court
has
set
up
in
its
several
cases
of
which
i
think
linkletter
was
practically
the
lead.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
several
times
in
its
submissions
to
this
court
by
argument,
it
has
said
that
there
are
three
governing
principles
on
prospective
and
retrospective
application.
the
first
principle,
it
says
the
purpose
to
be
served
by
the
new
constitutional
rule,
the
second
purpose,
government
reliance
on
the
prior
rule,
and
the
third,
the
effect
on
the
administration
of
justice.
we
suggest
to
this
court
that
none
of
those
has
any
validity
in
the
light
of
the
rationale
of
the
marchetti-grosso
decision.
this
is
dictated
by
a
basic
consideration.
the
basic
consideration
is
that
before
the
utilization
of
those
three
standards,
the
government
reads
an
insurmountable
barrier.
that
barrier
is
that
those
three
standards
do
not
even
come
into
operation
where
the
new
constitutional
rule
so
called
bears
on
the
integrity
of
the
guilt
determining
process.
here,
the
decision
of
marchetti
versus
grosso
does
bear
on
the
guilt
determining
process.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
rule
is
the
heart
and
soul
of
the
process.
the
only
act
of
the
claimant
here
which
are
contended
to
have
made
his
property
subject
to
this
forfeiture
is
his
refusal
to
waive
his
fifth
amendment
rights.
if
that
aspect
is
removed
from
the
case
as
constitutionally
unenforceable,
there
is
no
basis
for
a
finding
of
guilt.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
that’s
right
sir.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
yes
sir.
that’s
--
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
i
don’t
think
that
has
anything
to
do
with
the
basis
for
marchetti
and
grosso
or
how
it
affects
this
case,
not
withstanding
whatever
i
consider
as
mr.
angelini’s
lawyer
long
time
ago,
the
infirmities
are
the
proof
and
we
must
remember
that
there
is
no
federal
violation
in
carrying
$8,674.00,
nor
is
there
any
federal
violation
in
using
$8,674.00
in
gambling
activities;
maybe
a
state
violation,
but
not
a
federal
violation.
the
only
act
necessary
to
the
government’s
proof
not
to
the
way
it
puts
in
its
evidence,
not
to
the
way
it
enforces
a
search
warrant,
but
the
thing
necessary
to
its
basic
proof.
the
only
act
essential
to
that
guilt
finding
process
is
first,
that
4411,
section
4411
of
title
26,
the
payment
of
the
$50.00
occupational
tax
had
not
been
complied
with,
and
second
that
the
registration
form,
section
4412
had
not
been
filled
out
and
submitted
to
the
government.
now,
this
court
in
marchetti
versus
grosso
makes
it
clear
that
those
two
statutes
are
interdependent
because
as
it
found
from
the
decisions
in
those
cases,
you
couldn’t
pay
the
occupational
tax
without
filing
the
registration
and
obviously,
if
you
file
the
registration,
your
privilege
against
self-incrimination
had
been
greatly
--
well,
i
--
impinged
upon.
yes
sir,
you’re
about
to
say
something?
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
well,
yes.
i
think
if
--
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
oh,
yes.
you
will
find
that
in
the
--
in
the
libel,
libel
for
forfeiture.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
you’ll
find
in
the
findings,
and
if
i
may
refer
your
honor
to
the
appendix,
page
9,
finding
number
3,
and
also
in
the
first
paragraph
of
the
libel
at
page
5,
4401,
4411,
44
--
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
alright,
thank
you
sir.
the
thing
i’m
trying
to
point
out
and
i
hope
i’ve
done
it
is
the
only
act
that
would
make
this
forfeiture
valid
under
federal
law
is
proof
of
the
failure
to
comply
with
4411
and
4412.
the
only
basis
upon
which
guilt
could
be
found
is
the
refusal
to
waive
constitutional
rights
under
the
fifth
amendment.
so
actually,
if
i
suggest
to
the
court,
this
new
constitutional
so
called
rule
goes
to
the
guilt
finding
process,
and
the
three
considerations
for
which
the
government
--
on
which
the
government
suggests
that
you
waive
retroactivity
and
prospective
application
do
not
actually
come
into
play
here
because
this
is
beyond
the
consideration
or
the
entertainment
of
those
considerations.
but
if
this
court
disagrees
with
me
and
i
submit,
i
don’t
see
that
you
can
because
it
is
obvious
that
the
only
thing
that
will
prove
the
forfeiture
is
the
failure
to
waive
the
fifth
amendment
right.
if
you
do
not
agree
with
me,
let
us
go
then
to
the
purpose
to
be
served
by
this
new
rule.
i
think
the
lesson
to
be
learned
from
marchetti
and
grosso
is
that
you
may
not
compel
a
person
to
pay
a
tax
and
file
a
return
in
the
manner
required
by
4411
and
4412
unless
you
give
him
full
immunity.
the
next
question
urged
by
the
government
is
would
that
immunity,
require
immunity
just
from
criminal
prosecution
or
also
from
a
civil
forfeiture
a
pure
penalty
hearing
without
relation
to
any
$50.00
excise
tax.
it
seems
that
the
government’s
interpretation
of
this
so
called
new
rule
that
a
congressional
grant
of
pervasive
criminal
immunity
be
not
extent
to
these
penalty
forfeitures.
we
submit
and
we
have
submitted
on
the
basis
of
the
many
immunity
acts
passed
by
the
congress
that
the
congress
recognizes
that
to
give
full
immunity,
you
must
not
only
give
immunity
from
criminal
statutes,
but
also
your
immunity
must
extend
to
the
forfeitures.
without
unduly
burdening
this
court,
i
would
refer
your
honors
to
the
digest
of
the
wording
of
immunity
grants
that
we
have
set
out
at
pages
6
and
7
of
our
original
brief;
that’s
a
brief
for
the
claimant
respondent.
some
7,
8,
10,
15
statutes
and
all
worded
substantially
the
same.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
page
6,
your
honor,
this
is
not
the
supplemental
brief,
but
the
original
one.
“no
individual
shall
be
prosecuted
or
subject
to
any
penalty
or
forfeiture
for
an
account
of
any
transaction”
and
everyone
of
those
statutes
relating
to
the
giving
of
immunity
and
i
think,
that’s
what
this
court
suggested
to
cure
the
infirmity
found
in
4411
and
4412,
incorporate
immunity
from
any
forfeiture
proceeding.
i
say
that
diligent
effort
has
been
extended
to
this
point
and
we
found
none
that
accepted
forfeiture
from
the
full
scope
of
the
immunity.
now,
the
second
consideration
that
has
been
developed
under
the
linkletter
line
of
cases
concerns
the
extent
of
reliance
by
law
enforcement
authorities
on
the
old
standards
which
would
be
the
standards
under
the
kahriger
and
lewis.
but
this
question
i
submit
goes
directly
to
the
major
prohibition
against
the
application
of
the
government’s
considerations.
for
in
a
situation
where
limitation
has
been
made
to
prospective
application,
it
has
never
been
concerned
with
the
guilt
kind
of
finding
process.
it’s
always
been
directed
to
evidentiary
blunders.
i
would
like
to
refer
the
court
to
a
very
simple
statement
made
by
the
amicus
in
this
case,
and
i
think
he
has
developed
it
well.
he
says
in
his
brief
if
may
have
been
on
the
books,
the
government
could
have
--
the
police
could
have
obtained
warrants.
if
miranda
had
been
on
the
books,
the
requisite
warnings
could
have
been
given.
if
griffin
had
been
on
the
books,
prosecutors
could
have
avoided
commenting.
if
lee
had
been
on
the
books,
state
prosecutors
could’ve
avoided
offering
evidence
in
violation
of
605.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
i’m
reading
from
the
brief
of
the
amicus
because
i
thought
he
detailed
these
so
concisely
and
understandably.
it’s
at
page
6
and
he
continues
through
waive
in
gilbert
on
the
line
ups
and
duncan
and
bloom
jury
trial
for
--
in
contempt
cases.
in
no
instance,
if
this
so
called
new
rule
had
been
applied,
would
there
have
been
no
guilt
at
all
in
any
of
those
cases
where
we’ve
had
prospective
application.
here,
if
the
new
rule
is
applied,
there
just
is
not
a
basis
for
guilt.
now,
we
come
to
the
government’s
third
consideration;
that
is
the
effect
of
the
administration
of
justice.
it
isn’t
clear
to
us
just
how
the
government
thinks
that
there’s
going
to
be
an
affect
in
the
administration
of
justice.
a
rather
impressive
figure
was
offered
this
afternoon
of
some
two
and
a
half
million
dollars
involved
here.
even
more
impressive
figures
where
suggested
in
the
government’s
brief
about
some
$7
million
in
money
and
property
having
been
appropriated.
now,
i
suggest
that
should
it
be
necessary
for
the
government
to
give
back
any
of
this
money
or
property
that
the
simply
expedient
of
writing
a
check
is
the
answer
to
it,
and
there
will
be
no
interference
with
the
administration
of
justice.
in
the
meantime,
i
submit
that
the
government
has
been
recompensed
to
the
extent
of
probably
80
to
90%
of
the
money
and
property
it
has
appropriated.
counsel
has
indicated
in
this
argument
that
this
is
purely
a
remedial
statute,
this
statute
calling
for
forfeiture.
when
this
case
was
argued
the
first
time,
that
argument
was
also
made
with
a
special
reliance
being
made
on
helvering
versus
mitchell.
the
essence
of
that
argument
was
that
this
forfeiture
applying
the
rationale
of
the
helvering
case
did
not
constitute
a
penalty.
it
did
not
constitute
a
penalty
in
addition
to
the
criminal
sanctions,
but
rather
compensated
the
government
for
its
actual
loss.
as
this
court
knows
that
helvering
was
a
tax
assessment
case
and
concerned
the
50%
fraud
penalty.
there,
there
was
a
direct
relationship
to
the
outstanding
tax,
here
no
outstanding
tax
exists.
i
think
it
should
be
indicated
parenthetically,
though
it
is
indicated
in
the
briefs
that
mr.
angelini
has
been
assessed
for
the
$50.00
occupational
tax,
he
has
been
assessed
for
the
amount
that
the
government
assumes
that
he
made
--
or
the
10%
under
4401.
these
have
been
paid.
there
is
no
relationship
in
this
forfeiture
to
the
assessment
that
the
government
intended
on
account
of
these
activities.
so,
--
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
there
is
no
question
about
this.
again,
it’s
off
the
record.
mr.
angelini
has
paid
income
taxes
for
i
don’t
know
how
many
years.
there
has
never
been
any
question
about
the
validity
of
the
--
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
yes
sir,
helvering
versus
mitchell
is
--
with
direct
relation
to
the
outstanding
tax
obligation.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
under
the
ordinary
income
tax.
that
doesn’t
enter
this
case.
we
have
no
ascertainable
tax
outstanding
--
well,
we
just
have
none
outstanding.
whatever
it
has
been
assessed
has
been
paid
without
application
of
any
of
these
monies
toward
alleviating
that
tax
in
any
manner.
so
i
say,
it’s
beyond
question
of
doubt
that
this
constitutes
a
pure
penalty
and
it’s
remedial
of
nothing.
there
was
no
difficulty
of
investigation
such
as
we
talk
about
in
helvering
in
determining
how
much
mr.
mitchell
owed
the
united
states.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
mr.
angelini
made
claim
upon
that
money.
i
find
it
surprising
that
the
government
in
here
says
there
was
no
finding
that
mr.
angelini
was
not
the
owner
of
that
money.
he
and
he
alone
made
the
claim.
it
was
taken
from
his
person.
the
government
did
not
contest
on
trial
that
he
was
in
fact
the
rightful
claimant
and
rightful
owner.
i
do
believe
that’s
gone
down
the
drain.
i
think
i
have
addressed
myself
to
every
question
or
matter
brought
up
by
the
solicitor
general.
if
there
are
no
other
questions,
i
would
respectfully
submit
this
court
affirm
this
decision.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
assistant
solicitor
general
made
the
statement
that
the
seizure
of
this
money
did
not
disadvantage
mr.
angelini.
i
must
immediately
reply
that
it
certainly
did
disadvantage
mr.
angelini.
mr.
angelini,
they
did
go
to
jail
and
this
money
was
the
main
evidence
against
him.
he
also
said
the
money
belongs
to
we
know
not
whom.
i
submit
that
that
is
fairly
well
ignoring
the
record.
mr.
angelini
claimed
this
money
under
oath
as
owner
and
that
was
never
put
into
contest.
it
was
conceited
--
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
yes,
sir?
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
oh,
yes.
yes
sir.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
for
this
violation
under
4411
and
4412
--
7203
or
7302
for
this
particular
operation,
the
sportsman's
park
operation,
arising
out
of
this
arrest
--
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
he
was
convicted
of
willful
failure
to
file
under
4412
and
willful
failure
to
pay
--
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
that
conviction
has
already
been
served.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
yes,
sir.
i
might
say
also
that
that
the
assistant
solicitor
general
yesterday
overlooked
that
aside
from
the
fine
of
$2,500.00
and
the
60
days
in
jail,
he
also
was
given
the
3-year
probationary
period.
(voice
overlap)
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
this
would
not
have
had,
no.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
that's
true,
yes
sir.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
i
don't
think
it
does
either.
i
guess
what
--
i
just
want
to
point
out
that
there
has
been
some
disadvantaged
and
the
fact
of
his
conviction
was
argued
yesterday.
i
might
say
in
regard
to
the
proof
on
this
libel,
there
was
a
showing
that
he
hadn't
filed
under
4411
and
under
the
first
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
which
affirmed
the
forfeiture.
they
said
this
amount
of
cash
justified
the
inference
that
he
was
in
the
bookmaking
business.
this
they
termed
as
the
ready
cash
theory,
though
he
was
not
shown
to
have
taken
any
of
that
money
as
wagers
on
the
day
that
he
was
arrested.
no
wagers
were
seen
being
taken
by
him.
he
paid
out
no
money
in
response
to
collection,
the
very
wagers.
when
this
court
vacated
the
decision
of
the
seventh
circuit
--
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
that's
true.
i'm
talking
about
this
particular
trial,
this
particular
trial.
when
this
court
reversed
and
remanded
for
reappraisal
of
this
forfeiture
in
the
light
of
marchetti
and
grosso,
their
court
reversed,
finding
that
this
forfeiture
or
what
develops
into
a
forfeiture,
mr.
angelini
was
a
given
a
choice
between
self-incrimination
and
forfeiture
of
property
and
the
seventh
circuit
found
that
it
was
impermissible.
it's
of
course
clear
that
the
obligation
to
register
and
pay
the
occupational
tax
under
the
marchetti
case
was
recognized
as
creating
real
and
appreciable
hazards
to
self-incrimination.
i
submit
the
question
here
is
whether
mr.
angelini
forfeits
his
property
for
failing
to
assume
those
assets
and
for
refusal
actually
to
waive
his
constitutional
privilege.
the
government
of
course
argues
that
it
should
on
several
grounds.
the
government
in
its
brief
--
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
and
for
refusing
to
register.
this
court
recognized
in
the
marchetti
case
that
you
couldn't
do
one
without
the
other.
if
you
offer
to
pay
the
tax,
they
wouldn't
take
it.
internal
revenue
wouldn't
take
it
unless
you
registered
and
incriminated
yourself
or
ask
what
where
obviously
incriminatory
question,
certainly
under
illinois
law
as
well
as
most
states
in
the
united
states.
i
think
it's
interesting
that
the
government
in
its
argument
actually
resisted
on
the
application
boyd
to
this
case.
yet,
almost
from
the
inception,
the
argument
here
yesterday,
the
government
relied
on
boyd
as
authorizing
seizure
of
these
moneys.
last
night,
i
went
to
boyd
and
studied
it
very
carefully.
i
wanted
to
determine
what
was
the
source
of
this
argument
that
was
made
yesterday.
i
could
only
find
a
possible
reference
at
page
623
of
the
boyd
opinion
where
the
court
was
detailing
antecedent
history.
in
considering
the
statute
that
made
it
mandatory
upon
order
of
court
for
a
man
to
deliver
his
private
books
and
papers
to
determine
whether
or
not
he
had
paid
the
proper
duties,
the
supreme
court
in
boyd
said
even
the
obnoxious
writs
of
assistance
didn't
go
this
far.
they
said,
there
when
they
entered
into
warehouses,
unto
ships,
they
at
least
were
looking
for
stolen
property
or
property
which
no
duty
had
been
paid.
this
they
said
was
not
as
bad
as
what
the
contested
statute
in
boyd
did.
however,
that
court
was
not
endorsing
writs
of
assistance.
it
was
merely
say
that
this
statute
was
even
worse
than
that.
it
was
saying
that
writs
of
assistance
is
obnoxious
as
they
were,
were
not
compelling
a
man's
testimony
against
himself
out
of
his
own
mouth.
at
least
according
to
the
boyd
case,
the
writs
of
assistance
allowed
search
for
well,
what
was
actually
contraband.
and
in
that
sense,
they
weren't
as
bad
as
the
--
a
compelling
a
self-incrimination
by
a
person's
prior
papers.
but
as
i
said
--
private
papers
--
but
as
i
say,
they
were
not
endorsing
searches
in
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment,
nor
can
the
government
here
convert
the
words
from
boyd
into
an
endorsement
of
violation
of
the
fifth.
the
government's
invocation
of
boyd
yesterday
on
argument,
i
submit,
is
both
time-wise
inappropriate
and
content-wise
inappropriate.
it
is
clear
i
think
from
our
argument
that
we
rely
on
boyd
and
submit
to
this
court
that
the
decision
of
the
seventh
circuit
can
only
be
reversed
if
boyd
is
overruled
and
abandoned.
the
government
proposes
to
this
court
that
this
forfeiture
is
remedial
and
not
punitive.
i'm
not
really
entirely
sure
i
understand
this
argument.
i
wasn't
sure
when
i
receive
the
brief.
if
as
i
think
it
does,
punitive
means
punishment
for
a
wrong,
then
remedial
as
used
here
would
seem
to
mean
to
compensate
for
a
wrong.
if
that's
the
argument,
i
submit
to
this
court,
it
must
be
rejected.
the
occupational
tax,
this
as
the
court
knows,
$50.00.
the
forfeiture
here
is
over
$8,600.00.
it
would
seem
that
the
sheer
discrepancy
between
the
amounts
would
defeat
the
argument.
but
even
if
that
does
not
happen,
i
think
the
practicalities
of
the
matter
should.
this
$50.00
tax
and
the
penalties
and
the
interest
that
accrue
on
it
have
already
been
assessed
independently
by
the
government
and
they
have
been
collected.
the
government's
own
actions
and
--
an
independent
assessment
in
collection
reject
the
possibility
that
the
seizure
here
is
compensatory
rather
than
punitive.
i
submit
they
are
clearly
punitive
and
therefore
they
are
quasi
criminal
contrary
to
what
the
government
proposes.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
yes,
i
understood
that
(voice
overlap)
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
i
understood
that
to
be
another
fair
argument
mr.
justice.
i
understood
their
argument
to
say
that
this
is
remedial
and
not
punitive.
this
is
a
manner
of
taking
offending
articles
out
of
circulation.
i
understand
that
the
third
argument
is
its
in
rem
and
you
can't
avail
yourself
of
the
personal
privilege
of
the
claimant.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
well,
that's
precise
--
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
that's
precisely
what
our
answer
to
it
would
be,
that
theory
of
removal
of
this
offending
property
from
circulation.
money
certainly
isn't
offending.
certainly,
it
doesn't
offend
me
and
i
cannot
conceive,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
government
has
admitted,
they
have
no
intention
of
taking
it
out
of
circulation.
slot
machines,
roulette
wheels,
those
are
taken
out
of
circulation
and
destroyed;
that's
not
going
to
happen
to
this
money.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
yes,
sir?
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
yes
sir,
that's
the
excise
tax.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
you
understand
mr.
justice
brennan
that
there
was
no
proof
that
this
money
was
paid
as
wagers,
so
the
10%
could
not
attach
those
instances
where
in
this
masquerade
on
sportsman's
park
prove
have
been
shown
that
wagers
had
been
taken
by
these
men.
that
10%
tax
has
been
assessed.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
yes,
sir.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
no.
i
don't
mind
if
i
represent
it,
some
of
them
i
do
but
i
--
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
yes,
sir.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
oh,
no
that's
strictly
on
4411
and
4412,
4401
doesn't
come
into
it.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
i
didn't
see
the
government's
argument
resting
on
mitchell.
i
noticed
that
mitchell
was
cited
three
times
in
the
brief.
it
was
not
expanded
upon.
i
was
somewhat
surprise
this
morning
to
find
that
that
was
their
principle
area
of
reliance.
you're
talking
now
of
compensating
the
united
states
for
the
cost
of
its
investigation?
is
that
the
--
the
solicitor
general
argued
that
this
morning.
it
was
him
who
argued
in
the
brief.
i
was
totally
unprepared
for
it,
but
i
would
submit
that
this
is
not
a
very
learned
argument
coming
at
somewhat
as
rather
surprised
that
this
really
personal
for
the
cost
of
investigation
appears
to
have
no
equality,
the
case
that
follows
this
is
we
have
to
say
300,000
compensatory
for
the
cost
of
investigation.
here
for
some
reason,
8,600
is
compensatory
for
the
cost
of
investigation
under
their
argument.
it
--
rather
what
surprises
me
that
in
criminal
cases,
where
cost
of
investigations
of
this
type
are
made
at
least
have
never
been
assessed
as
valid
cost,
and
i
don't
see
how
validly
these
monies
can
be
seize
and
say
were
compensating
the
government
for
the
use
of
their
agents
or
whatever
it
might
be.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
$2,500.00.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
that
could
help.
as
to
their
in
rem
argument,
the
government
has
argued
that
subject
--
property
subject
to
forfeiture
enjoys
no
privilege
against
self-incrimination
which
can
be
asserted
to
prevent
their
forfeiture.
they
say
that
this
is
an
in
rem
proceeding
brought
against
the
property
itself
and
it
may
not
avail
itself
of
the
owner's
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
we
submit
to
this
court
that
this
argument
was
refused
long
ago
in
the
boyd
case,
which
rejected
any
argument
that
the
technical
character
of
a
forfeiture
as
an
in
rem
proceeding
against
the
property
had
any
effect
on
the
right
of
the
owner
of
the
property
to
assert
as
a
defense
violation
of
his
constitutional
rights,
and
the
court
recognized
this
owner
--
the
court
in
boyd
recognized
the
owner
as
a
substantial
party
to
the
in
rem
suit,
and
therefore
in
a
position
to
raise
violations
of
his
constitutional
rights.
i
might
say
at
this
time
that
the
case
on
which
--
well
which
the
united
states
urged
was
in
conflict
with
this
case,
wherein
the
deans
are
claimants
in
its
something
against
a
19
something.
their
case
differs
substantially
in
this
regard.
here,
we
have
a
man
who
is
recognized
as
an
owner
by
the
trial
court.
the
boyd
case
says
as
an
owner
recognized
is
a
substantial
party
and
has
right
to
raise
his
constitutional
rights.
i
think
it's
very
important
to
recognize
that
in
the
dean
case,
the
trial
court
found
that
the
deans
the
claimants
were
not
the
owners
of
the
property.
therefore
actually,
the
deans
would
have
no
standing
in
that
lawsuit.
their
claim
as
owner
was
rejected
by
the
findings
of
the
court.
i
think
that's
a
substantial
difference
between
their
case
and
this
and
i
thought
i
would
like
to
bring
it
to
the
court's
attention.
there
is
one
basic
difference,
i
might
say,
while
we
rely
on
boyd,
i
mean
we
rely
on
plymouth.
there's
a
basic
difference
between
those
cases
and
this
one
at
bar.
in
those
cases,
the
typical
point
was
the
prohibition
in
choosing
in
a
forfeiture
case,
evidence
illegally
assert
--
secured
from
the
owner.
here,
we
have
kind
of
the
other
side
of
the
coin.
we
--
they
claim
forfeiture
of
property
because
the
owner
refused
or
omitted
to
give
evidence
against
himself
in
violation
of
his
constitutional
rights,
because
if
he
had
waived
his
constitutional
rights,
there
would
be
no
forfeiture
here.
the
rational
of
this
forfeiture
action
is
the
--
the
forfeiture
of
property
for
invoking
the
constitutional
privilege,
and
i
submit
to
this
of
course
in
the
true
sense
of
the
word,
this
makes
the
constitutional
privilege
what
has
been
used
so
often,
this
makes
it
cost.
the
government
makes
a
further
argument
that
in
the
abstract,
an
owner
could
be
entirely
innocent
of
any
wrongdoing
or
illegality
and
the
property
would
still
be
subject
to
forfeiture.
and
in
the
abstract,
that
can
be
true.
but
here,
necessary
to
forfeiture
is
the
illegal
intent
of
the
possessor,
and
this
court
in
one
1958
plymouth
versus
pennsylvania
made
that
eminently
clear
the
difference
between
properties
that
are
forfeitable
per
se
and
properties
that
require
proof
of
the
use
in
order
for
them
to
become
forfeitable.
now,
and
it
pointed
out
that
when
dealing
with
articles
that
are
innocent
as
themselves
as
the
money
is
here,
the
articles
derive
their
contraband
nature
only
from
the
acts
or
the
intent
of
the
possessor
or
user.
the
act
of
the
intent
of
mr.
angelini
which
is
necessary
to
make
this
property
subject
to
forfeiture
is
first
the
operation
of
a
wagering
business
which
is
not
illegal
under
federal
law,
and
secondly,
the
failure
to
comply
with
the
registration
provisions
of
4412
and
the
payment
of
the
$50.00
under
4411.
to
have
on
the
act,
it
would
under
marchetti
require
that
he
incriminate
himself.
it
is
our
submission
most
basically
that
no
illegal
intent
can
be
inferred
from
the
exercise
of,
or
a
refusal
to
waive
constitutional
rights.
it's
our
position
that
property
can't
assume
a
contraband
nature
from
such
exercise
or
refusal
by
the
possessor.
and
if
it
can't
derive
a
contraband
nature
from
the
acts
or
intent
of
the
possessor,
it's
not
contraband
and
it
is
therefore
not
subject
to
forfeiture
because
the
proof
necessary
to
the
derivative
forfeiture
has
failed.
i
submit
therefore
that
none
of
the
government's
arguments
are
going
to
suffice
to
forfeit
these
goods.
i
submit
that
the
decision
of
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
should
be
affirmed.
we
then
come
to
the
aspect
of
this
case
that
was
not
presented
to
the
seventh
circuit.
this
is
the
urging
by
the
government
of
strict
prospective
application
of
the
marchetti-grosso
decisions
in
forfeiture
cases
if
this
court
should
determine
that
they
applied
forfeiture
cases.
i
would
also
submit
to
this
court
on
that
point
that
the
government
has
made
no
argument
to
encourage
this
court
validly
to
employ
strict
prospective
application.
its
own
cases
and
i
refer
particularly
to
the
case
that
most
relies
on
linkletter
recognized
that
the
general
rule
is
retroactive
application.
it
also
recognized
an
exception
to
that
rule
where
a
decision,
an
earlier
decision
is
overruled
as
this
court
by
marchetti-grosso
overruled
character
in
louis.
that
rule
is
that
intermediate
cases
finally
decided
should
not
be
upset.
this
case
of
course
is
not
finally
decided.
this
standard
of
limited
applicability
refer
to
by
this
court
in
linkletter
as
being
appropriate
to
a
circumstance
such
as
we
have
here
is
not
even
considered
by
the
government
on
this
argument.
it
doesn't
enlighten
us
what
if
any
havoc
would
ensue
where
the
marchetti-grosso
decisions
made
applicable
to
forfeiture
cases
or
how
they
would
it
upset
the
administration
of
justice.
they
give
us
no
countervailing
considerations
which
this
court
recognized
were
necessary
to
strict
application
of
prospective
application
that
would
take
this
case
out
of
the
limited
retroactivity
rule.
the
government's
whole
argument
relates
to
the
potentialities
of
a
volume
of
litigation
relating
to
property
forfeited
in
the
past,
finally
forfeited,
and
they
say
that
provides
a
sound
and
practical
reason
for
this
court
to
apply
prospective
application.
it
pays
no
attention
to
cases
not
finally
decided
such
as
this.
it
gives
no
reason
by
this
court
to
not
declare
limited
retroactivity
in
accordance
with
the
rule
pronounced
in
linkletter.
we
submit
the
rule
should
be
employed
to
cases
such
as
this
and
finally
decided
and
we
further
submit
that
no
countervailing
considerations
have
been
suggested
by
the
government
for
not
employing
that
rule.
and
some
then,
if
the
court
please,
we
submit
to
--
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
there
was
a
month
long
surveillance
at
sportsman's
park.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
early
in
the
month
of
august
of
1963,
he
had
been
seen
talking
--
oh,
there
was
one
occasion
where
a
man
came
up
to
him
and
said
something
like
tantamount
of
work,
one
occasion
in
the
month.
he
was
seen
receiving
money
from
bookmakers
who
were
convicted
or
who
pleaded
guilty
and
he
was
seen
giving
the
money,
but
not
within
a
week
of
this
particular
day.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
yes,
according
to
the
evidence,
yes
sir.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
well,
i
don't
really
know
that,
but
i
would
suggest
that
they
were
getting
better
at.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
and
he
didn't
know
in
the
racetrack
either.
oh,
there
is,
oh
yes.
there
was
evidence
of
that
too.
they
were
able
to
give
credit
betting
and
you
can't
get
credit
betting
at
the
pari-mutuel
window.
i
have
nothing
further
unless
there
are
some
questions.
thank
you.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
i
already
explained
to
your
honor
that
i
wasn't
unprepared
for
that.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
i
don't
think
mitchell
applies
if
the
case
stands
for
what
i
understood
from
the
oral
argument
because
it
sets
no
standard.
how
could
one
person
be
well
hurt
to
the
extent
of
maybe
$300,000.00
as
we
have
in
the
sixth
circuit
case
in
8600
here
or
moreover?
the
purpose
of
agents
is
for
the
most
part
to
investigate
criminal
activities.
i
have
never
seen
and
i
don't
believe
there
is
any
basis
or
any
incidents
where
investigative
processes
have
been
recognize
as
an
assessable
cost
and
i
suggest
on
that
account
and
i
admit
it's
kind
of
off
the
top
of
my
head
that
i
can't
see
where
it
could
logically
be
applied
as
a
reason
for
forfeiting
these
moneys.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
well,
i
have
no
problem
with
individual
deeds
having
criminal
and
civil
problems,
but
i
--
or
sanctions,
but
i
do
say
that
what
is
inadmissible
in
a
--
for
the
purposes
of
a
criminal
sanction
is
certainly
inadmissible
for
the
purposes
of
the
civil
sanction.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
i
think
that's
what
makes
it
bad.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
as
i
think
this
court
in
marchetti
clearly
asks
the
congress
to
adjust
this
statute.
i
think
if
i
interpret
your
decision
correctly,
you
are
asking
for
immunity.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
that's
right.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
i
think
its
quasi
criminal.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
yes.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
yes,
sir.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
lavin.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
yes
sir.
if
it
please
the
court,
i
don’t
--
counsel
made
a
factual
mistake
and
i
don’t
know
that
it
has
any
real
significance,
but
i
think
we
may
as
well
dispose
of
it,
so
we
will
at
least
recognize
that
there
is
no
fourth
amendment
question
in
this
case.
counsel
stated
that
a
search
was
made
of
mr.
angelini’s
person
at
the
time
of
his
arrest,
it
developed
that
there
was
some
$8,600.00
on
this
person.
actually,
the
money
was
revealed
at
the
time
he
went
through
the
ordinary
processing
at
the
united
states
marshall’s
office
on
a
request
to
empty
his
pockets
as
all
persons
taken
into
custody
are.
the
money
was
not
seized
at
the
race
track
as
counsel
indicated.
as
i
say,
i
don’t
think
it’s
a
matter
of
great
consequence
one
way
or
another.
mr.
justice
blackmun
asked
about
cases
remanded
at
the
same
time
as
was
this
case.
i
point
out
that
not
one
to
my
knowledge
in
that
one
has
the
government
requested
certiorari
where
the
--
we
had
a
criminal
matter
involved.
they
however
have
made
a
distinction
in
this
case
because
it
concerns
forfeiture.
i
think
that
there
is
no
distinction
between
a
criminal
conviction
and
a
forfeiture
proceeding.
i
think
that
marchetti
and
grosso
apply
equally
to
both.
the
announced
object
of
this
court
in
deciding
marchetti
and
grosso
was
the
protest
or
rather
the
protection
of
the
individual
against
self-incrimination
under
the
comprehensive
system
of
federal
and
state
prohibitions
against
wagering
activities.
in
malloy
versus
hogan,
this
court
said
in
part
that
the
fifth
amendment
secures
the
right
of
a
person
to
remain
silent
unless
he
wishes
to
speak
in
the
unfettered
exercise
of
his
own
will
and
to
suffer
no
penalties.
in
spevack
versus
klein,
again,
this
court
emphasized
that
penalties
used
in
the
context
of
the
malloy
case
is
not
restricted
to
fine
or
imprisonment;
that
it
means
any
sanction
that
makes
assertion
of
the
privilege
is
in
the
word
this
court
did
costly,
and
we
have
the
spevack,
disbarment,
(inaudible)
loss
of
job,
the
young
lady
who
lost
her
position
as
a
teacher
whose
name
i
don’t
now
remember.
so
i
suggest
to
the
court,
if
marchetti
and
grosso
have
retroactive
effect,
a
question
that
has
not
until
right
now
to
my
knowledge
was
brought
up
so
far
as
criminality
is
concerned,
then
it
has
retroactive
effect
so
far
as
forfeiture
proceedings
are
concerned.
i
would
like
to
address
myself
just
in
passing
to
the
mackey
case
because
that
was
also
a
product
of
questioning
by
the
court.
the
seventh
circuit
stated
that
its
distinction
between
mackey
and
the
earlier
case
of
lookretis
which
was
remanded
by
this
court,
a
criminal
gambling
prosecution,
though
under
1952,
the
distinction
it
made
was
that
mackey
did
not
involved
gambling
offenses,
it
being
an
income
tax
evasion
case.
later,
the
second
circuit
in
--
i
mean,
the
seventh
circuit
in
even
a
more
recent
case
decided
on
september
9,
1970,
zizzo
versus
the
united
states
in
reversing
zizzo
said
we
distinguish
this
from
mackey
because
mackey
did
not
come
within
the
object
of
the
supreme
court
when
they
said
they
wanted
to
protect
a
privilege
against
self-incrimination
where
local
and
state
gambling
statutes
were
concerned.
that’s
the
distinction
the
seventh
circuit
makes
and
i
submit
to
this
court
that
it’s
a
valid
one.
now,
counsel
here
has
indicated
that
this
court
has
recognized
in
certain
instances
boyd
is
not
a
deterrent
to
the
--
well,
to
implement
error,
interpretation
of
constitutional
rights.
i
might
say
that
when
any
--
whenever
this
court
has
held
--
so
spoken
it
has
spoken
in
regard
to
sixth
amendment
rights
and
has
expressly
omitted
from
consideration
any
fifth
amendment
rights
which
it
has
always
considered
pervasive.
the
government
opines
here
before
this
court
that
marchetti-grosso
applies
prospectively.
i
assume
that
the
government
uses
the
standards
that
this
court
has
set
up
in
its
several
cases
of
which
i
think
linkletter
was
practically
the
lead.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
several
times
in
its
submissions
to
this
court
by
argument,
it
has
said
that
there
are
three
governing
principles
on
prospective
and
retrospective
application.
the
first
principle,
it
says
the
purpose
to
be
served
by
the
new
constitutional
rule,
the
second
purpose,
government
reliance
on
the
prior
rule,
and
the
third,
the
effect
on
the
administration
of
justice.
we
suggest
to
this
court
that
none
of
those
has
any
validity
in
the
light
of
the
rationale
of
the
marchetti-grosso
decision.
this
is
dictated
by
a
basic
consideration.
the
basic
consideration
is
that
before
the
utilization
of
those
three
standards,
the
government
reads
an
insurmountable
barrier.
that
barrier
is
that
those
three
standards
do
not
even
come
into
operation
where
the
new
constitutional
rule
so
called
bears
on
the
integrity
of
the
guilt
determining
process.
here,
the
decision
of
marchetti
versus
grosso
does
bear
on
the
guilt
determining
process.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
rule
is
the
heart
and
soul
of
the
process.
the
only
act
of
the
claimant
here
which
are
contended
to
have
made
his
property
subject
to
this
forfeiture
is
his
refusal
to
waive
his
fifth
amendment
rights.
if
that
aspect
is
removed
from
the
case
as
constitutionally
unenforceable,
there
is
no
basis
for
a
finding
of
guilt.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
that’s
right
sir.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
yes
sir.
that’s
--
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
i
don’t
think
that
has
anything
to
do
with
the
basis
for
marchetti
and
grosso
or
how
it
affects
this
case,
not
withstanding
whatever
i
consider
as
mr.
angelini’s
lawyer
long
time
ago,
the
infirmities
are
the
proof
and
we
must
remember
that
there
is
no
federal
violation
in
carrying
$8,674.00,
nor
is
there
any
federal
violation
in
using
$8,674.00
in
gambling
activities;
maybe
a
state
violation,
but
not
a
federal
violation.
the
only
act
necessary
to
the
government’s
proof
not
to
the
way
it
puts
in
its
evidence,
not
to
the
way
it
enforces
a
search
warrant,
but
the
thing
necessary
to
its
basic
proof.
the
only
act
essential
to
that
guilt
finding
process
is
first,
that
4411,
section
4411
of
title
26,
the
payment
of
the
$50.00
occupational
tax
had
not
been
complied
with,
and
second
that
the
registration
form,
section
4412
had
not
been
filled
out
and
submitted
to
the
government.
now,
this
court
in
marchetti
versus
grosso
makes
it
clear
that
those
two
statutes
are
interdependent
because
as
it
found
from
the
decisions
in
those
cases,
you
couldn’t
pay
the
occupational
tax
without
filing
the
registration
and
obviously,
if
you
file
the
registration,
your
privilege
against
self-incrimination
had
been
greatly
--
well,
i
--
impinged
upon.
yes
sir,
you’re
about
to
say
something?
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
well,
yes.
i
think
if
--
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
oh,
yes.
you
will
find
that
in
the
--
in
the
libel,
libel
for
forfeiture.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
you’ll
find
in
the
findings,
and
if
i
may
refer
your
honor
to
the
appendix,
page
9,
finding
number
3,
and
also
in
the
first
paragraph
of
the
libel
at
page
5,
4401,
4411,
44
--
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
alright,
thank
you
sir.
the
thing
i’m
trying
to
point
out
and
i
hope
i’ve
done
it
is
the
only
act
that
would
make
this
forfeiture
valid
under
federal
law
is
proof
of
the
failure
to
comply
with
4411
and
4412.
the
only
basis
upon
which
guilt
could
be
found
is
the
refusal
to
waive
constitutional
rights
under
the
fifth
amendment.
so
actually,
if
i
suggest
to
the
court,
this
new
constitutional
so
called
rule
goes
to
the
guilt
finding
process,
and
the
three
considerations
for
which
the
government
--
on
which
the
government
suggests
that
you
waive
retroactivity
and
prospective
application
do
not
actually
come
into
play
here
because
this
is
beyond
the
consideration
or
the
entertainment
of
those
considerations.
but
if
this
court
disagrees
with
me
and
i
submit,
i
don’t
see
that
you
can
because
it
is
obvious
that
the
only
thing
that
will
prove
the
forfeiture
is
the
failure
to
waive
the
fifth
amendment
right.
if
you
do
not
agree
with
me,
let
us
go
then
to
the
purpose
to
be
served
by
this
new
rule.
i
think
the
lesson
to
be
learned
from
marchetti
and
grosso
is
that
you
may
not
compel
a
person
to
pay
a
tax
and
file
a
return
in
the
manner
required
by
4411
and
4412
unless
you
give
him
full
immunity.
the
next
question
urged
by
the
government
is
would
that
immunity,
require
immunity
just
from
criminal
prosecution
or
also
from
a
civil
forfeiture
a
pure
penalty
hearing
without
relation
to
any
$50.00
excise
tax.
it
seems
that
the
government’s
interpretation
of
this
so
called
new
rule
that
a
congressional
grant
of
pervasive
criminal
immunity
be
not
extent
to
these
penalty
forfeitures.
we
submit
and
we
have
submitted
on
the
basis
of
the
many
immunity
acts
passed
by
the
congress
that
the
congress
recognizes
that
to
give
full
immunity,
you
must
not
only
give
immunity
from
criminal
statutes,
but
also
your
immunity
must
extend
to
the
forfeitures.
without
unduly
burdening
this
court,
i
would
refer
your
honors
to
the
digest
of
the
wording
of
immunity
grants
that
we
have
set
out
at
pages
6
and
7
of
our
original
brief;
that’s
a
brief
for
the
claimant
respondent.
some
7,
8,
10,
15
statutes
and
all
worded
substantially
the
same.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
page
6,
your
honor,
this
is
not
the
supplemental
brief,
but
the
original
one.
“no
individual
shall
be
prosecuted
or
subject
to
any
penalty
or
forfeiture
for
an
account
of
any
transaction”
and
everyone
of
those
statutes
relating
to
the
giving
of
immunity
and
i
think,
that’s
what
this
court
suggested
to
cure
the
infirmity
found
in
4411
and
4412,
incorporate
immunity
from
any
forfeiture
proceeding.
i
say
that
diligent
effort
has
been
extended
to
this
point
and
we
found
none
that
accepted
forfeiture
from
the
full
scope
of
the
immunity.
now,
the
second
consideration
that
has
been
developed
under
the
linkletter
line
of
cases
concerns
the
extent
of
reliance
by
law
enforcement
authorities
on
the
old
standards
which
would
be
the
standards
under
the
kahriger
and
lewis.
but
this
question
i
submit
goes
directly
to
the
major
prohibition
against
the
application
of
the
government’s
considerations.
for
in
a
situation
where
limitation
has
been
made
to
prospective
application,
it
has
never
been
concerned
with
the
guilt
kind
of
finding
process.
it’s
always
been
directed
to
evidentiary
blunders.
i
would
like
to
refer
the
court
to
a
very
simple
statement
made
by
the
amicus
in
this
case,
and
i
think
he
has
developed
it
well.
he
says
in
his
brief
if
may
have
been
on
the
books,
the
government
could
have
--
the
police
could
have
obtained
warrants.
if
miranda
had
been
on
the
books,
the
requisite
warnings
could
have
been
given.
if
griffin
had
been
on
the
books,
prosecutors
could
have
avoided
commenting.
if
lee
had
been
on
the
books,
state
prosecutors
could’ve
avoided
offering
evidence
in
violation
of
605.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
i’m
reading
from
the
brief
of
the
amicus
because
i
thought
he
detailed
these
so
concisely
and
understandably.
it’s
at
page
6
and
he
continues
through
waive
in
gilbert
on
the
line
ups
and
duncan
and
bloom
jury
trial
for
--
in
contempt
cases.
in
no
instance,
if
this
so
called
new
rule
had
been
applied,
would
there
have
been
no
guilt
at
all
in
any
of
those
cases
where
we’ve
had
prospective
application.
here,
if
the
new
rule
is
applied,
there
just
is
not
a
basis
for
guilt.
now,
we
come
to
the
government’s
third
consideration;
that
is
the
effect
of
the
administration
of
justice.
it
isn’t
clear
to
us
just
how
the
government
thinks
that
there’s
going
to
be
an
affect
in
the
administration
of
justice.
a
rather
impressive
figure
was
offered
this
afternoon
of
some
two
and
a
half
million
dollars
involved
here.
even
more
impressive
figures
where
suggested
in
the
government’s
brief
about
some
$7
million
in
money
and
property
having
been
appropriated.
now,
i
suggest
that
should
it
be
necessary
for
the
government
to
give
back
any
of
this
money
or
property
that
the
simply
expedient
of
writing
a
check
is
the
answer
to
it,
and
there
will
be
no
interference
with
the
administration
of
justice.
in
the
meantime,
i
submit
that
the
government
has
been
recompensed
to
the
extent
of
probably
80
to
90%
of
the
money
and
property
it
has
appropriated.
counsel
has
indicated
in
this
argument
that
this
is
purely
a
remedial
statute,
this
statute
calling
for
forfeiture.
when
this
case
was
argued
the
first
time,
that
argument
was
also
made
with
a
special
reliance
being
made
on
helvering
versus
mitchell.
the
essence
of
that
argument
was
that
this
forfeiture
applying
the
rationale
of
the
helvering
case
did
not
constitute
a
penalty.
it
did
not
constitute
a
penalty
in
addition
to
the
criminal
sanctions,
but
rather
compensated
the
government
for
its
actual
loss.
as
this
court
knows
that
helvering
was
a
tax
assessment
case
and
concerned
the
50%
fraud
penalty.
there,
there
was
a
direct
relationship
to
the
outstanding
tax,
here
no
outstanding
tax
exists.
i
think
it
should
be
indicated
parenthetically,
though
it
is
indicated
in
the
briefs
that
mr.
angelini
has
been
assessed
for
the
$50.00
occupational
tax,
he
has
been
assessed
for
the
amount
that
the
government
assumes
that
he
made
--
or
the
10%
under
4401.
these
have
been
paid.
there
is
no
relationship
in
this
forfeiture
to
the
assessment
that
the
government
intended
on
account
of
these
activities.
so,
--
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
there
is
no
question
about
this.
again,
it’s
off
the
record.
mr.
angelini
has
paid
income
taxes
for
i
don’t
know
how
many
years.
there
has
never
been
any
question
about
the
validity
of
the
--
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
yes
sir,
helvering
versus
mitchell
is
--
with
direct
relation
to
the
outstanding
tax
obligation.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
under
the
ordinary
income
tax.
that
doesn’t
enter
this
case.
we
have
no
ascertainable
tax
outstanding
--
well,
we
just
have
none
outstanding.
whatever
it
has
been
assessed
has
been
paid
without
application
of
any
of
these
monies
toward
alleviating
that
tax
in
any
manner.
so
i
say,
it’s
beyond
question
of
doubt
that
this
constitutes
a
pure
penalty
and
it’s
remedial
of
nothing.
there
was
no
difficulty
of
investigation
such
as
we
talk
about
in
helvering
in
determining
how
much
mr.
mitchell
owed
the
united
states.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
mr.
angelini
made
claim
upon
that
money.
i
find
it
surprising
that
the
government
in
here
says
there
was
no
finding
that
mr.
angelini
was
not
the
owner
of
that
money.
he
and
he
alone
made
the
claim.
it
was
taken
from
his
person.
the
government
did
not
contest
on
trial
that
he
was
in
fact
the
rightful
claimant
and
rightful
owner.
i
do
believe
that’s
gone
down
the
drain.
i
think
i
have
addressed
myself
to
every
question
or
matter
brought
up
by
the
solicitor
general.
if
there
are
no
other
questions,
i
would
respectfully
submit
this
court
affirm
this
decision.
