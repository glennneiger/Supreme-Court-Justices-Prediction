if
he
had
taken
out
the
gambling
statute,
you
couldn't
have
seized
the

could
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
he
had
bought
the
stamp
and
fill
that
all
of
these
material
and
paid
whatever
--
pay
10
cents
in
tax,

you?
justice

park
bought
stamps,
you
wouldn't
have
been
able
to
seize
the

is
that
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
you
see
no
connection
between
the
stamp
and
the
seizure?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
do
you
say
unregistered
gambling?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
the
stamp?
justice
thurgood
marshall
stamp
is
a
registry.
justice
thurgood
marshall
when
you
said
unregistered
gambling,
i
was
trying
to
be
sure
with
register
you
were
talking
about.

telling
about
the
second
one,
not
the

the

justice
thurgood

did
you
say
the

justice
thurgood
marshall
the
old

cases?
justice
thurgood

did
they
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
but
i
mean
if
a
man
was
eventually
acquitted,
what
did
they
do
with
that?
i’m
not
talking
about
the
liquor;
i’m
talking
about
the
whiskey
here.
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
about
the

justice
thurgood
marshall
how
about
an
automobile?
justice
thurgood
marshall
even
if
the

was
found
not
--
justice
thurgood

what
i
understand
that
in
this
hearing,
there
was
evidence
put
on
that
he
was
gambling,
and
that
this
money
was
used
in
gambling?
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
hearing
is
a
forfeiture
hearing?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
marchetti-grosso,
does
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
i’m
just
looking
at
the
findings
and
the
judgment
of
district
court
made
no
mention
at
all,
neither
document
mentions
the
wagering
tax?
justice
thurgood
marshall
was
it
in
the

itself?
justice
thurgood
