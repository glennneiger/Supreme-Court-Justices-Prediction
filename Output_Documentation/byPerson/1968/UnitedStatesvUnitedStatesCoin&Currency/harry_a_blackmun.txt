mr.

do
you
know
what
has
happened
to
the
other
case
that

remanded
at
the
same
time,
the
other
cases?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
this
is
the
only
forfeiture
case
in
the
group?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
none
of
the
cases
remanded
with
angelini
under
the
title
of
stone
against
the
united
states?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
that
involved
forfeiture
other
than
angelini?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
while
i
have
you
interrupted,
do
i
correctly
assume
that
the
seventh
circuit
assumed
in
this
case
took
it
for
granted
the
retroactivity
of
marchetti-grosso?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
is
it
on
that
comment
that
you’ve
just
made
that
one
may
resolve
any
seeming
inconsistency
with
the
seventh
circuit’s
decision
in
mackey,
maybe,
they’re
not
inconsistent.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
just
one
last
question
and
i’ll
stop
interrupting
you.
i
take
it
you
sense
no
inconsistency
between
the
seventh
circuit’s
respective
decisions
in
this
case
and
in
mackey?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
they’re
different
panels,
except
for
one
judge?
