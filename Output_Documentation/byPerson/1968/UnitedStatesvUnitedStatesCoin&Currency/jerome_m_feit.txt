mr.
jerome
m.
feit
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
statutory
forfeiture
case
under
the
internal
revenue
laws
which
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
issued
at
the
government’s
behest,
seeking
review
of
the
decision
of
the
seventh
circuit
which
it
held,
forfeiture
of
property
used
in
violation
of
the
wagering
tax
laws
is
precluded
by
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
under
this
court’s
decisions
in
marchetti
and
grosso.
this
case
was
originally
argued
in
the
1968
term,
february
1969
and
its
here
on
re-argument.
the
relevance
--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
no,
it’s
on
the
same
brief,
your
honor.
the
relevant
factual
background
maybe
briefly
stated.
during
august
of
1963,
investigation
by
fbi
and
alcohol
tax
agents,
of
a
race
track
in
cicero,
illinois
revealed
that
claimant
angelini
and
others
were
engaged
in
an
unlawful
bookmaking
activities
at
the
track,
the
surveillance
expand
a
course
of
some
three
weeks.
on
august
24,
1963,
mr.
angelini
and
his
confederates
were
arrested
at
the
race
track
pursuant
to
an
arrest
warrant.
a
search
of
this
person
subsequently
revealed
that
he
was
in
possession
of
$8,674.00
in
currency.
in
1964,
mr.
angelini
was
criminally
convicted
of
willful
failure
to
register
under
section
4412
of
title
26
and
to
pay
the
annual
$50.00
occupational
tax
under
section
4411.
he
was
sentenced
to
60
days
in
prison,
fined
$2,500.00
and
placed
on
probation
for
three
years.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
his
conviction
in
1965,
and
this
court
denied
certiorari.
meanwhile,
an
entirely
separate
proceeding
in
february
1964
was
instituted
in
libel
in
rem
against
the
respondent
money
which
had
been
seized
at
the
race
track.
the
libel
alleged
that
the
money
was
forfeit
to
the
government
by
virtue
of
its
use
and
its
intent
for
use
in
violation
of
the
internal
revenue
laws,
section
7302
which
is
set
forth
at
page
3
of
our
brief.
claimant
angelini
intervened,
asserting
that
property
belonged
to
him.
a
trial
was
there
after
held
by
the
court
and
in
june
1965,
approximately
12
federal
agents
testified
to
their
observations
of
the
1963
bookmaking
operations
at
the
race
track,
and
it
was
also
evidenced
that
the
respondent
money
was
used
in
the
business
as
ready-cash
to
pay
off
bettings.
it
was
also
stipulated
at
this
trial
that
although
claimant
angelini
had
registered
and
paid
the
occupational
tax
in
1957
and
1958,
he
had
not
done
so
for
the
period
covering
1963.
the
district
court
found
and
its
findings
are
set
forth
at
pages
9
and
10
of
the
appendix,
there
was
no
jury
trial
and
none
having
been
demanded
in
the
forfeiture
proceeding,
that
a
bookmaking
business
had
been
conducted
at
the
race
track
from
august
1
to
august
24,
1963
without
payment
of
the
required
taxes
that
the
respondent
money
was
“integral
part
of
this
operation”
and
it
therefore
was
forfeit
to
the
united
states.
the
court
of
appeals
thereafter
affirmed
on
the
basis
of
kahriger
and
lewis
and
claimant
filed
a
petition
for
certiorari.
the
case
was
pending
here
on
that
petition
when
this
court
decided
marchetti-grosso
and
some
five
weeks
after
that
decision,
remanded
this
case
to
the
seventh
circuit
for
reconsideration
in
light
of
the
marchetti-grosso
rulings.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
my
understanding
of
the
other
cases
were
several
of
them
were
remanded
were
criminal
cases
which
involved
convictions
under
7203
for
failing
to
file
the
appropriate
forms.
those
cases
were
remanded
to
the
courts
of
appeals
and
my
understanding
is
that
they
were
--
the
convictions
were
dismissed.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
this
--
no.
the
--
what
happened
was
this.
there
were
many
forfeiture
cases
pending
in
the
district
courts
at
the
time.
when
this
case
was
remanded,
they
were
in
the
sense
frozen.
at
the
present
time,
my
--
excuse
me,
at
the
present
time,
there
are
20
forfeiture
cases
pending
on
appeal
in
the
courts
of
appeals.
there
are
some
200
cases
pending
in
the
district
courts
awaiting
decision
in
this
seventh
circuit
case.
there
is
on
certiorari
another
case,
two
other
cases,
the
dean
case
which
involves
$300,000.00
and
455
this
term
which
--
sixth
circuit
case
which
the
sixth
circuit
affirmed
on
the
authority
of
its
dean
ruling.
i’m
also
informed
that
involved
in
those
cases,
presently
pending,
approximately
$200
million
--
excuse
me,
approximately
two
and
a
quarter
million
dollars
primarily
automobiles
and
cash,
but
those
cases
have
just
been
awaiting
this
court’s
decision
in
angelini.
there
has
been
no
--
there
has
been
--
well,
i
shouldn’t
say
no,
there
had
been
perhaps
one
to
two
forfeiture
proceedings
instituted
subsequent
to
the
remand
of
angelini.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
that
is
correct.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
that
is
my
understanding.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
i
would
assume
that
seventh
circuit
assumed
in
this
case
that
marchetti-grosso
was
retroactive
to
the
extent
that
it
applied
to
all
cases
within
its
reach
pending
on
appeal
when
marchetti-grosso
was
decided.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
well,
mackey
involved
a
non-gambling
offense
which
is
one
basic
distinction.
it’s
on
habeas
on
2255
and
collateral
attack
involved
a
final
conviction.
i
think
the
basic
thing
here
was
that
the
seventh
circuit
assumed
that
marchetti-grosso
applied
to
all
cases
pending
on
appeal
by
virtue
of
stone
and
that
this
case
was
simply
a
marchetti-grosso
case.
and
it
is
our
position
that
the
seventh
circuit
erred
in
that
conclusion
that
neither
the
letter
nor
the
spirit
of
the
fifth
amendment
privilege,
nor
its
application
in
marchetti-grosso
support
the
determination
of
the
seventh
circuit
in
this
case.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
well,
--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
that’s
right.
they
can
be
distinguished.
i
think
that
there
have
been
inconsistencies
primarily
and
difficulties
in
courts
of
appeals
in
applying
the
principles
of
marchetti-grosso
in
these
myriad
of
situations
because
it
is
not
been
clear
--
the
issue
of
retroactivity
had
not
been
focused
on
by
this
court
in
marchetti
and
grosso
at
all.
the
assumption
had
been
by
virtue
of
grosso
and
by
virtue
of
stone
that
all
cases
pending
on
appeal,
criminal
cases
involving
marchetti-grosso
violations
was
subject
to
its
terms,
we
think
that
mackey
can
be
distinguished
from
this
case
in
terms
of
the
fact
that
it’s
an
income
tax
case,
that
is
on
collateral
attack,
it’s
not
within
penumbra
of
the
wagering
tax
scheme
and
--
but,
i
would
like
to
focus
if
i
may
on
this
particular
case
which
as
i
say,
our
starting
point
is
marchetti
and
grosso
to
determine
what
it
did
and
what
it
did
not
hold
for
purposes
of
this
case.
in
marchetti-grosso,
this
court
determined
that
if
a
gambler
failed
to
register
and
pay
the
occupational
tax,
he
was
subject
to
criminal
prosecution.
on
the
other
hand,
if
he
did
register,
he
faced
the
real
danger
of
the
information
he
had
provided
which
subjected
him
to
prosecution
under
a
network
of
federal
or
state
provisions
making
gambling
a
crime.
marchetti
and
grosso
as
we
read
the
opinion,
freed
the
gambler
from
this
dilemma
by
holding
that
the
comprehensive
scheme
could
not
be
employed
“to
punish
criminally
a
gambler
who
defends
a
failure
to
comply
with
the
assertion
of
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination."
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
in
this
case?
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
no,
it
is
not
your
honor.
there
--
we
have
filed
following
this
case,
there
are
questions
of
retroactivity,
different
in
context
than
the
problem
focused
upon
here
which
will
follow
in
the
next
three
cases
--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
--
which
the
government
has
developed
in
some
detail
its
general
positions
on
the
retroactivity
question
in
different
context.
mackey,
of
course,
does
involve
a
conviction,
allegedly
in
violation
of
marchetti-grosso,
and
that
was
filed
last
term.
the
next
two
cases
involve
a
full
development
in
the
fourth
amendment
context
on
the
retroactivity
issue,
but
in
this
case,
no
further
brief
have
been
filed.
it
seems
to
us
that
in
marchetti
and
grosso,
the
court
repeatedly
made
clear
that
the
wagering
tax
scheme
was
being
left
intact,
that
neither
the
occupational
nor
excise
tax
provisions
were
invalid
with
its
civil
liability
was
in
anyway
being
extinguished,
that
in
short
as
the
court
pointed
out
in
mr.
justice
harlan’s
opinion,
its
holding
was
not
meant
to
prevent
either
the
taxation
or
regulation
by
congress
of
activities
otherwise
made
unlawful
by
federal
or
state
law
--
statutes.
the
erosion
of
the
privilege
in
that
setting
thus
was
that
the
compulsion
was
directed
at
individual
who
if
he
failed
to
succumb
had
to
pay
the
price
of
criminal
punishment.
as
mr.
justice
brennan
put
it
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
grosso,
that
scheme
was
designed
primarily
for
and
utilized
to
pierce
the
anonymity
of
citizens
engaged
in
criminal
activities.
we
think
that
the
root
fallacy
of
decision
of
the
seventh
circuit
is
its
equation
of
statutory
forfeiture
with
the
criminal
punishment
dealt
within
marchetti-grosso.
it
misapprehends
the
continuing
existence
of
the
wagering
tax
scheme
and
in
our
judgment
overlooks
wholly
the
fact
that
statutory
forfeiture
from
the
time
of
blackstone
and
before
was
recognized
as
a
remedial
measure
to
enforce
a
tax
still
entirely
valid.
i
think
it’s
quite
important
on
this
aspect
of
my
argument
to
emphasize
that
this
distinction
between
criminal
or
common
law
forfeiture
and
statutory
forfeiture.
in
criminal
forfeiture,
it
is
necessary
to
prove
the
guilt
of
the
owner
in
order
to
forfeit
property,
whether
or
not
the
owner
himself
is
convicted.
in
statutory
forfeiture,
the
guilt
or
innocence
of
the
owner
of
the
property
is
irrelevant.
it
is
the
illegal
use
or
intent
to
use
--
or
intention
to
use
the
property
in
violation
of
law
which
is
the
material
consideration.
these
cases
are
set
out
in
our
brief,
goldsmith,
bryant,
the
most
perhaps
best
illustration
was
during
the
period
of
prohibition.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
you
mean
in
this
particular
wagering
scheme,
not
--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
no,
no.
i
know
what
you
mean,
within
the
gambling
tax
scheme,
not
that
i
know
of
this.
as
i
had
indicated,
that
is
precisely
--
that’s
a
remission
proceeding
which
may
or
may
not
be
available,
but
as
far
as
i
know,
the
cases
have
not
been
remitted.
there
has
been
no
remission
proceedings
and
the
money
was
not
been
turned
over
presumably
to
the
bettors.
as
i
had
indicated
before
that
the
district
court
have
some
200
cases
presently
pending,
and
that
there
are
20
cases
pending
on
appeal
in
the
area.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
i’m
--
excuse
me,
i’m
sorry.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
ah
--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
the
old
liquor
cases
quite
clearly
recognized
this
distinction
your
honor.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
oh,
the
whiskey
--
the
whiskey
was
in
a
sense
contraband
that
forfeit.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
the
money
is
not
contraband
in
the
traditional
sense
of
the
term,
but
we’re
dealing
with
the
use
in
an
internal
revenue
statute.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
the
automobile
was
forfeit.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
oh,
there
were
two
--
there
were
separate
provisions,
and
that’s
why
i’d
like
to
talk
about
perhaps
the
prohibition
act
to
give
you
an
illustration
of
what
i
meant.
one
provision
of
the
prohibition
act,
section
26
provided
for
a
criminal
prosecution
and
the
traditional
theory
of
criminal
or
common
law
forfeiture
that
upon
such
conviction,
the
property
used
would
be
forfeit.
and
there
was
another
provision
which
was
in
the
revised
statutes
and
which
is
the
predecessor
of
the
instant
provision
which
didn’t
focus
upon
the
owner
or
the
--
owner,
but
focused
on
the
use,
and
the
question
arose
as
to
whether
they
were
inconsistent
as
to
whether
you
had
to
use
one
or
the
other
provisions.
and
this
court
made
clear
in
one
ford
coupe,
which
is
at
272
united
states
that
these
provisions
were
not
inconsistent,
that
if
the
government
used
the
internal
revenue
provision
rather
than
these
precise
criminal
forfeiture
--
criminal
provision
which
entail
forfeiture
that
the
innocence
or
guilt
of
the
owner
was
wholly
irrelevant.
and
this
seems
to
me
to
be
the
very
essence
of
boyd
upon
which
claimant
relies
and
upon
which
the
court
of
appeals
rested
its
decision.
namely,
in
boyd,
what
the
court
was
dealing
with
was
this
criminal
forfeiture
provision,
so
that
we,
of
course,
do
not
request
this
court
to
retreat
one
inch
from
boyd
in
this
case.
our
position
is
as
mr.
justice
brandeis
made
clear
and
held
them
against
mitchell
that
boyd
is
not
applicable
here
and
boyd
itself
has
recognized.
indeed,
the
quoting,
the
supplemental
brief
filed
by
the
claimant
in
page
11,
quoting
from
boyd
makes
it
quite
clear
that
they
were
talking
about
punishment
of
the
individual.
that
was
the
essence
of
criminal
forfeiture,
the
essence
of
statutory
forfeiture,
the
kind
that
is
here
involved
is
to
remove
property
which
has
been
used
in
violation
of
the
law.
the
basic
purpose
of
that
is
that
the
property
cannot
be
so
used
again.
it
is
a
remedial,
traditionally
and
historically
a
remedial
function.
if
there’s
any
privilege
in
these
circumstances,
it
is
that
of
a
property
not
that
those
who
would
put
the
property
to
illegal
use.
for
example,
relevant
here
i
think
is
this
court’s
decision
in
campbell
painting
corporation
at
392
u.s.
where
the
president
of
the
corporation
could
not
proclaim
--
complain
because
he
suffered
an
economic
loss
or
felt
compulsion
because
of
his
refusal
under
a
claim
of
privilege
to
testify
before
a
grand
jury
which
resulted
in
termination
of
his
corporation’s
contract.
his
privilege
had
not
entered
into
the
matter
of
law
at
all.
so
here,
neither
thus
the
privilege
of
mr.
angelini,
nor
anyone
else
engaged
in
the
gambling
business.
that
protection
has
already
been
afforded.
no
gamblers
as
i
understand
the
decisions
of
this
court
could
be
prosecuted
criminally
for
failing
to
file
the
requisite
forms.
and
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
knox,
the
converse
would
be
true
if
one
filed
under
the
compulsion
of
the
statutory
scheme
which
led
to
conviction
for
a
gambling
offense
or
led
to
a
prosecution
for
gambling
offense,
as
this
mr.
justice
harlan
pointed
out
in
knox,
then
the
claim
of
privilege
would
be
available.
this
would
be
the
other
side
of
the
coin,
and
that
was
the
lookretis
case
which
this
court
referred
to
in
the
knox
opinion.
it
is
our
alternative
position
in
this
respect
that
even
if
the
privilege
of
forfeiture
be
deemed
a
penalty,
it
is
not
every
degree
of
compulsion
or
every
type
of
penalty
which
the
privilege
bars.
here,
the
penalty
is
attenuated
and
the
closest
analogy
as
i’ve
noted
is
the
campbell
painting
corporation
case,
and
also
gardner
and
broderick
in
uniformed
sanitation
men
which
are
recited
in
our
brief.
in
those
cases,
it
was
recognized
that
public
employees
could
be
discharged
for
public
--
from
public
employment
for
failure
to
provide
information
to
the
state
relating
directly
to
and
narrowly
to
the
performance
of
their
official
duties,
so
long
as
the
discharge
was
not
based
upon
the
invocation
of
the
privilege,
and
where
the
invocation
could
not
be
used
against
them
in
later
criminal
prosecutions.
here,
it
seems
to
us
whatever
penalties
and
i’ve
--
this
is
an
alternative
argument
that
that
even
assuming
that
i’m
wrong
that
these
are
not
penalties,
whatever
penalties
maybe
said
to
--
which
attach
to
the
gambler
or
even
more
remote
in
collateral,
he
has
the
protection
of
the
privilege
from
criminal
prosecution
and
it
seems
to
us
it
would
be
straining
grosso
and
marchetti
quite
clearly
beyond
its
--
their
holdings
if
in
addition
he
may
retain
property
which
may
or
may
not
be
his.
for
example
in
buick
sedan,
this
court
--
district
court
concluded
that
the
$300,000.00
there
seized
did
not
belong
to
the
claimants,
and
there’s
nothing
to
indicate
here
except
for
claim
of
claimant
that
the
$8,000.00
seized
belong
to
him.
the
district
court
made
no
such
finding
at
all.
the
gambler,
it
seems
to
us
should
be
no
preferred
position,
that
privilege
should
not
we
think
be
converted
into
a
license
to
use
property
in
violation
of
valid
and
existing
tax
provisions.
if
the
court
is
of
a
view
that
the
principles
however
of
marchetti
and
grosso
are
applicable
in
this
civil
context,
then
a
question
of
retroactivity
emerges.
this
takes
on
perhaps
several
forms.
first,
it
seems
to
us,
it
would
have
to
be
decided
that
marchetti
and
grosso
itself,
the
straight
marchetti-grosso
situation
was
fully
retroactive.
and
then
if
so,
whether
this
case
would
fall
within
those
principles,
our
basic
position
is
that
marchetti
and
grosso
is
not
retroactive
in
the
criminal
context
under
the
gambling
statutes
where
relief
from
its
terms
is
sought
on
post
conviction
review
under
the
three-pronged
standard
of
purpose,
reliance
and
effect
upon
the
administration
of
justice.
we
would
certainly
argue
that
while
this
case
technically
is
on
direct
review,
but
it
is
also
collateral
in
the
sense
that
we
are
not
here
dealing
with
criminal
convictions.
we’re
dealing
with
the
issue
of
an
alleged
interest
in
property
used
in
gambling.
with
property
in
fact
which
was
seized
in
august
1963,
two
years
before
this
court
decided
albertson
i
might
point
out,
five
years
before
it
decided
marchetti-grosso.
it
is
therefore
not
at
all
comparable
we
think
to
cases
on
direct
appeal
in
the
criminal
context.
we
think
that
the
purpose
and
effect
upon
the
administration
of
justice
also
counsel
persuasively
against
retroactivity.
the
time
of
the
seizure
here,
kahriger
and
lewis
with
the
law
and
the
seizing
officers
could
legitimately
rely
on
those
decisions.
even
more,
significant
is
the
disruptive
effect
upon
the
administration
of
justice
in
applying
marchetti
retroactively
in
this
forfeiture
context.
i’d
indicated
the
extent
of
the
case
is
presently
pending
and
the
money
involved
in
these
various
forfeitures.
we
are
further
advised
by
internal
revenue
service
that
since
1951
when
these
gambling
statutes
were
enacted,
and
i
use
their
phrase
literally
thousands
of
items
used
in
gambling,
automobiles
and
money
have
been
forfeit
under
the
wagering
tax
statute.
we
have
set
forth
some
of
these
figures
--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
well,
the
reason
i
cannot
--
in
the
marchetti-grosso
context.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
the
reason
i
think
that
i
cannot
urge
that
is
two-fold.
one,
this
court
dealt
with
grosso
which
involved
a
claim
other
than
--
a
claim,
an
addition
to
the
claim
there
made,
the
claim
of
marchetti-grosso
and
remanded
it,
the
court
in
stone
sent
--
remanded
all
the
cases
pending
on
appeal
when
marchetti-grosso
was
decided.
and
while
the
court
did
not
focus
upon
the
reasons
for
it,
is
it
is
plain
that
the
court
has
concluded
that
case
is
pending
upon
appeal
--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
well,
you
have
not
said
that
and
as
i
say,
the
court
has
not
spoken
on
the
matter
at
all.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
it
might
be
and
if
that
is
true,
then
it
seems
to
us
that
it
counsels
favorably
as
to
retroactivity
on
collateral
attack.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
right.
the
government’s
position
as
if
it
were
an
open
matter
on
that
supposition
is
that
marchetti-grosso
should
apply
prospectively.
mr.
jerome

approach.
all
i
was
suggesting
was
the
--
even
if
the
court
deems
that
what
had
done
following
marchetti-grosso
doesn’t
require
it
to
do
the
same
things
the
case
is
pending
on
collateral
attack,
but
as
--
in
answer
to
your
precise
question
mr.

our
view
would
be
prospectivity,
if

this
is
a
statutory
forfeiture
case
under
the
internal
revenue
laws
which
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
issued
at
the
government’s
behest,
seeking
review
of
the
decision
of
the
seventh
circuit
which
it
held,
forfeiture
of
property
used
in
violation
of
the
wagering
tax
laws
is
precluded
by
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
under
this
court’s
decisions
in
marchetti
and
grosso.
this
case
was
originally
argued
in
the
1968
term,
february
1969
and
its
here
on
re-argument.
the
relevance
--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
no,
it’s
on
the
same
brief,
your
honor.
the
relevant
factual
background
maybe
briefly
stated.
during
august
of
1963,
investigation
by
fbi
and
alcohol
tax
agents,
of
a
race
track
in
cicero,
illinois
revealed
that
claimant
angelini
and
others
were
engaged
in
an
unlawful
bookmaking
activities
at
the
track,
the
surveillance
expand
a
course
of
some
three
weeks.
on
august
24,
1963,
mr.
angelini
and
his
confederates
were
arrested
at
the
race
track
pursuant
to
an
arrest
warrant.
a
search
of
this
person
subsequently
revealed
that
he
was
in
possession
of
$8,674.00
in
currency.
in
1964,
mr.
angelini
was
criminally
convicted
of
willful
failure
to
register
under
section
4412
of
title
26
and
to
pay
the
annual
$50.00
occupational
tax
under
section
4411.
he
was
sentenced
to
60
days
in
prison,
fined
$2,500.00
and
placed
on
probation
for
three
years.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
his
conviction
in
1965,
and
this
court
denied
certiorari.
meanwhile,
an
entirely
separate
proceeding
in
february
1964
was
instituted
in
libel
in
rem
against
the
respondent
money
which
had
been
seized
at
the
race
track.
the
libel
alleged
that
the
money
was
forfeit
to
the
government
by
virtue
of
its
use
and
its
intent
for
use
in
violation
of
the
internal
revenue
laws,
section
7302
which
is
set
forth
at
page
3
of
our
brief.
claimant
angelini
intervened,
asserting
that
property
belonged
to
him.
a
trial
was
there
after
held
by
the
court
and
in
june
1965,
approximately
12
federal
agents
testified
to
their
observations
of
the
1963
bookmaking
operations
at
the
race
track,
and
it
was
also
evidenced
that
the
respondent
money
was
used
in
the
business
as
ready-cash
to
pay
off
bettings.
it
was
also
stipulated
at
this
trial
that
although
claimant
angelini
had
registered
and
paid
the
occupational
tax
in
1957
and
1958,
he
had
not
done
so
for
the
period
covering
1963.
the
district
court
found
and
its
findings
are
set
forth
at
pages
9
and
10
of
the
appendix,
there
was
no
jury
trial
and
none
having
been
demanded
in
the
forfeiture
proceeding,
that
a
bookmaking
business
had
been
conducted
at
the
race
track
from
august
1
to
august
24,
1963
without
payment
of
the
required
taxes
that
the
respondent
money
was
“integral
part
of
this
operation”
and
it
therefore
was
forfeit
to
the
united
states.
the
court
of
appeals
thereafter
affirmed
on
the
basis
of
kahriger
and
lewis
and
claimant
filed
a
petition
for
certiorari.
the
case
was
pending
here
on
that
petition
when
this
court
decided
marchetti-grosso
and
some
five
weeks
after
that
decision,
remanded
this
case
to
the
seventh
circuit
for
reconsideration
in
light
of
the
marchetti-grosso
rulings.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
my
understanding
of
the
other
cases
were
several
of
them
were
remanded
were
criminal
cases
which
involved
convictions
under
7203
for
failing
to
file
the
appropriate
forms.
those
cases
were
remanded
to
the
courts
of
appeals
and
my
understanding
is
that
they
were
--
the
convictions
were
dismissed.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
this
--
no.
the
--
what
happened
was
this.
there
were
many
forfeiture
cases
pending
in
the
district
courts
at
the
time.
when
this
case
was
remanded,
they
were
in
the
sense
frozen.
at
the
present
time,
my
--
excuse
me,
at
the
present
time,
there
are
20
forfeiture
cases
pending
on
appeal
in
the
courts
of
appeals.
there
are
some
200
cases
pending
in
the
district
courts
awaiting
decision
in
this
seventh
circuit
case.
there
is
on
certiorari
another
case,
two
other
cases,
the
dean
case
which
involves
$300,000.00
and
455
this
term
which
--
sixth
circuit
case
which
the
sixth
circuit
affirmed
on
the
authority
of
its
dean
ruling.
i’m
also
informed
that
involved
in
those
cases,
presently
pending,
approximately
$200
million
--
excuse
me,
approximately
two
and
a
quarter
million
dollars
primarily
automobiles
and
cash,
but
those
cases
have
just
been
awaiting
this
court’s
decision
in
angelini.
there
has
been
no
--
there
has
been
--
well,
i
shouldn’t
say
no,
there
had
been
perhaps
one
to
two
forfeiture
proceedings
instituted
subsequent
to
the
remand
of
angelini.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
that
is
correct.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
that
is
my
understanding.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
i
would
assume
that
seventh
circuit
assumed
in
this
case
that
marchetti-grosso
was
retroactive
to
the
extent
that
it
applied
to
all
cases
within
its
reach
pending
on
appeal
when
marchetti-grosso
was
decided.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
well,
mackey
involved
a
non-gambling
offense
which
is
one
basic
distinction.
it’s
on
habeas
on
2255
and
collateral
attack
involved
a
final
conviction.
i
think
the
basic
thing
here
was
that
the
seventh
circuit
assumed
that
marchetti-grosso
applied
to
all
cases
pending
on
appeal
by
virtue
of
stone
and
that
this
case
was
simply
a
marchetti-grosso
case.
and
it
is
our
position
that
the
seventh
circuit
erred
in
that
conclusion
that
neither
the
letter
nor
the
spirit
of
the
fifth
amendment
privilege,
nor
its
application
in
marchetti-grosso
support
the
determination
of
the
seventh
circuit
in
this
case.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
well,
--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
that’s
right.
they
can
be
distinguished.
i
think
that
there
have
been
inconsistencies
primarily
and
difficulties
in
courts
of
appeals
in
applying
the
principles
of
marchetti-grosso
in
these
myriad
of
situations
because
it
is
not
been
clear
--
the
issue
of
retroactivity
had
not
been
focused
on
by
this
court
in
marchetti
and
grosso
at
all.
the
assumption
had
been
by
virtue
of
grosso
and
by
virtue
of
stone
that
all
cases
pending
on
appeal,
criminal
cases
involving
marchetti-grosso
violations
was
subject
to
its
terms,
we
think
that
mackey
can
be
distinguished
from
this
case
in
terms
of
the
fact
that
it’s
an
income
tax
case,
that
is
on
collateral
attack,
it’s
not
within
penumbra
of
the
wagering
tax
scheme
and
--
but,
i
would
like
to
focus
if
i
may
on
this
particular
case
which
as
i
say,
our
starting
point
is
marchetti
and
grosso
to
determine
what
it
did
and
what
it
did
not
hold
for
purposes
of
this
case.
in
marchetti-grosso,
this
court
determined
that
if
a
gambler
failed
to
register
and
pay
the
occupational
tax,
he
was
subject
to
criminal
prosecution.
on
the
other
hand,
if
he
did
register,
he
faced
the
real
danger
of
the
information
he
had
provided
which
subjected
him
to
prosecution
under
a
network
of
federal
or
state
provisions
making
gambling
a
crime.
marchetti
and
grosso
as
we
read
the
opinion,
freed
the
gambler
from
this
dilemma
by
holding
that
the
comprehensive
scheme
could
not
be
employed
“to
punish
criminally
a
gambler
who
defends
a
failure
to
comply
with
the
assertion
of
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination."
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
in
this
case?
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
no,
it
is
not
your
honor.
there
--
we
have
filed
following
this
case,
there
are
questions
of
retroactivity,
different
in
context
than
the
problem
focused
upon
here
which
will
follow
in
the
next
three
cases
--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
--
which
the
government
has
developed
in
some
detail
its
general
positions
on
the
retroactivity
question
in
different
context.
mackey,
of
course,
does
involve
a
conviction,
allegedly
in
violation
of
marchetti-grosso,
and
that
was
filed
last
term.
the
next
two
cases
involve
a
full
development
in
the
fourth
amendment
context
on
the
retroactivity
issue,
but
in
this
case,
no
further
brief
have
been
filed.
it
seems
to
us
that
in
marchetti
and
grosso,
the
court
repeatedly
made
clear
that
the
wagering
tax
scheme
was
being
left
intact,
that
neither
the
occupational
nor
excise
tax
provisions
were
invalid
with
its
civil
liability
was
in
anyway
being
extinguished,
that
in
short
as
the
court
pointed
out
in
mr.
justice
harlan’s
opinion,
its
holding
was
not
meant
to
prevent
either
the
taxation
or
regulation
by
congress
of
activities
otherwise
made
unlawful
by
federal
or
state
law
--
statutes.
the
erosion
of
the
privilege
in
that
setting
thus
was
that
the
compulsion
was
directed
at
individual
who
if
he
failed
to
succumb
had
to
pay
the
price
of
criminal
punishment.
as
mr.
justice
brennan
put
it
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
grosso,
that
scheme
was
designed
primarily
for
and
utilized
to
pierce
the
anonymity
of
citizens
engaged
in
criminal
activities.
we
think
that
the
root
fallacy
of
decision
of
the
seventh
circuit
is
its
equation
of
statutory
forfeiture
with
the
criminal
punishment
dealt
within
marchetti-grosso.
it
misapprehends
the
continuing
existence
of
the
wagering
tax
scheme
and
in
our
judgment
overlooks
wholly
the
fact
that
statutory
forfeiture
from
the
time
of
blackstone
and
before
was
recognized
as
a
remedial
measure
to
enforce
a
tax
still
entirely
valid.
i
think
it’s
quite
important
on
this
aspect
of
my
argument
to
emphasize
that
this
distinction
between
criminal
or
common
law
forfeiture
and
statutory
forfeiture.
in
criminal
forfeiture,
it
is
necessary
to
prove
the
guilt
of
the
owner
in
order
to
forfeit
property,
whether
or
not
the
owner
himself
is
convicted.
in
statutory
forfeiture,
the
guilt
or
innocence
of
the
owner
of
the
property
is
irrelevant.
it
is
the
illegal
use
or
intent
to
use
--
or
intention
to
use
the
property
in
violation
of
law
which
is
the
material
consideration.
these
cases
are
set
out
in
our
brief,
goldsmith,
bryant,
the
most
perhaps
best
illustration
was
during
the
period
of
prohibition.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
you
mean
in
this
particular
wagering
scheme,
not
--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
no,
no.
i
know
what
you
mean,
within
the
gambling
tax
scheme,
not
that
i
know
of
this.
as
i
had
indicated,
that
is
precisely
--
that’s
a
remission
proceeding
which
may
or
may
not
be
available,
but
as
far
as
i
know,
the
cases
have
not
been
remitted.
there
has
been
no
remission
proceedings
and
the
money
was
not
been
turned
over
presumably
to
the
bettors.
as
i
had
indicated
before
that
the
district
court
have
some
200
cases
presently
pending,
and
that
there
are
20
cases
pending
on
appeal
in
the
area.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
i’m
--
excuse
me,
i’m
sorry.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
ah
--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
the
old
liquor
cases
quite
clearly
recognized
this
distinction
your
honor.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
oh,
the
whiskey
--
the
whiskey
was
in
a
sense
contraband
that
forfeit.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
the
money
is
not
contraband
in
the
traditional
sense
of
the
term,
but
we’re
dealing
with
the
use
in
an
internal
revenue
statute.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
the
automobile
was
forfeit.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
oh,
there
were
two
--
there
were
separate
provisions,
and
that’s
why
i’d
like
to
talk
about
perhaps
the
prohibition
act
to
give
you
an
illustration
of
what
i
meant.
one
provision
of
the
prohibition
act,
section
26
provided
for
a
criminal
prosecution
and
the
traditional
theory
of
criminal
or
common
law
forfeiture
that
upon
such
conviction,
the
property
used
would
be
forfeit.
and
there
was
another
provision
which
was
in
the
revised
statutes
and
which
is
the
predecessor
of
the
instant
provision
which
didn’t
focus
upon
the
owner
or
the
--
owner,
but
focused
on
the
use,
and
the
question
arose
as
to
whether
they
were
inconsistent
as
to
whether
you
had
to
use
one
or
the
other
provisions.
and
this
court
made
clear
in
one
ford
coupe,
which
is
at
272
united
states
that
these
provisions
were
not
inconsistent,
that
if
the
government
used
the
internal
revenue
provision
rather
than
these
precise
criminal
forfeiture
--
criminal
provision
which
entail
forfeiture
that
the
innocence
or
guilt
of
the
owner
was
wholly
irrelevant.
and
this
seems
to
me
to
be
the
very
essence
of
boyd
upon
which
claimant
relies
and
upon
which
the
court
of
appeals
rested
its
decision.
namely,
in
boyd,
what
the
court
was
dealing
with
was
this
criminal
forfeiture
provision,
so
that
we,
of
course,
do
not
request
this
court
to
retreat
one
inch
from
boyd
in
this
case.
our
position
is
as
mr.
justice
brandeis
made
clear
and
held
them
against
mitchell
that
boyd
is
not
applicable
here
and
boyd
itself
has
recognized.
indeed,
the
quoting,
the
supplemental
brief
filed
by
the
claimant
in
page
11,
quoting
from
boyd
makes
it
quite
clear
that
they
were
talking
about
punishment
of
the
individual.
that
was
the
essence
of
criminal
forfeiture,
the
essence
of
statutory
forfeiture,
the
kind
that
is
here
involved
is
to
remove
property
which
has
been
used
in
violation
of
the
law.
the
basic
purpose
of
that
is
that
the
property
cannot
be
so
used
again.
it
is
a
remedial,
traditionally
and
historically
a
remedial
function.
if
there’s
any
privilege
in
these
circumstances,
it
is
that
of
a
property
not
that
those
who
would
put
the
property
to
illegal
use.
for
example,
relevant
here
i
think
is
this
court’s
decision
in
campbell
painting
corporation
at
392
u.s.
where
the
president
of
the
corporation
could
not
proclaim
--
complain
because
he
suffered
an
economic
loss
or
felt
compulsion
because
of
his
refusal
under
a
claim
of
privilege
to
testify
before
a
grand
jury
which
resulted
in
termination
of
his
corporation’s
contract.
his
privilege
had
not
entered
into
the
matter
of
law
at
all.
so
here,
neither
thus
the
privilege
of
mr.
angelini,
nor
anyone
else
engaged
in
the
gambling
business.
that
protection
has
already
been
afforded.
no
gamblers
as
i
understand
the
decisions
of
this
court
could
be
prosecuted
criminally
for
failing
to
file
the
requisite
forms.
and
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
knox,
the
converse
would
be
true
if
one
filed
under
the
compulsion
of
the
statutory
scheme
which
led
to
conviction
for
a
gambling
offense
or
led
to
a
prosecution
for
gambling
offense,
as
this
mr.
justice
harlan
pointed
out
in
knox,
then
the
claim
of
privilege
would
be
available.
this
would
be
the
other
side
of
the
coin,
and
that
was
the
lookretis
case
which
this
court
referred
to
in
the
knox
opinion.
it
is
our
alternative
position
in
this
respect
that
even
if
the
privilege
of
forfeiture
be
deemed
a
penalty,
it
is
not
every
degree
of
compulsion
or
every
type
of
penalty
which
the
privilege
bars.
here,
the
penalty
is
attenuated
and
the
closest
analogy
as
i’ve
noted
is
the
campbell
painting
corporation
case,
and
also
gardner
and
broderick
in
uniformed
sanitation
men
which
are
recited
in
our
brief.
in
those
cases,
it
was
recognized
that
public
employees
could
be
discharged
for
public
--
from
public
employment
for
failure
to
provide
information
to
the
state
relating
directly
to
and
narrowly
to
the
performance
of
their
official
duties,
so
long
as
the
discharge
was
not
based
upon
the
invocation
of
the
privilege,
and
where
the
invocation
could
not
be
used
against
them
in
later
criminal
prosecutions.
here,
it
seems
to
us
whatever
penalties
and
i’ve
--
this
is
an
alternative
argument
that
that
even
assuming
that
i’m
wrong
that
these
are
not
penalties,
whatever
penalties
maybe
said
to
--
which
attach
to
the
gambler
or
even
more
remote
in
collateral,
he
has
the
protection
of
the
privilege
from
criminal
prosecution
and
it
seems
to
us
it
would
be
straining
grosso
and
marchetti
quite
clearly
beyond
its
--
their
holdings
if
in
addition
he
may
retain
property
which
may
or
may
not
be
his.
for
example
in
buick
sedan,
this
court
--
district
court
concluded
that
the
$300,000.00
there
seized
did
not
belong
to
the
claimants,
and
there’s
nothing
to
indicate
here
except
for
claim
of
claimant
that
the
$8,000.00
seized
belong
to
him.
the
district
court
made
no
such
finding
at
all.
the
gambler,
it
seems
to
us
should
be
no
preferred
position,
that
privilege
should
not
we
think
be
converted
into
a
license
to
use
property
in
violation
of
valid
and
existing
tax
provisions.
if
the
court
is
of
a
view
that
the
principles
however
of
marchetti
and
grosso
are
applicable
in
this
civil
context,
then
a
question
of
retroactivity
emerges.
this
takes
on
perhaps
several
forms.
first,
it
seems
to
us,
it
would
have
to
be
decided
that
marchetti
and
grosso
itself,
the
straight
marchetti-grosso
situation
was
fully
retroactive.
and
then
if
so,
whether
this
case
would
fall
within
those
principles,
our
basic
position
is
that
marchetti
and
grosso
is
not
retroactive
in
the
criminal
context
under
the
gambling
statutes
where
relief
from
its
terms
is
sought
on
post
conviction
review
under
the
three-pronged
standard
of
purpose,
reliance
and
effect
upon
the
administration
of
justice.
we
would
certainly
argue
that
while
this
case
technically
is
on
direct
review,
but
it
is
also
collateral
in
the
sense
that
we
are
not
here
dealing
with
criminal
convictions.
we’re
dealing
with
the
issue
of
an
alleged
interest
in
property
used
in
gambling.
with
property
in
fact
which
was
seized
in
august
1963,
two
years
before
this
court
decided
albertson
i
might
point
out,
five
years
before
it
decided
marchetti-grosso.
it
is
therefore
not
at
all
comparable
we
think
to
cases
on
direct
appeal
in
the
criminal
context.
we
think
that
the
purpose
and
effect
upon
the
administration
of
justice
also
counsel
persuasively
against
retroactivity.
the
time
of
the
seizure
here,
kahriger
and
lewis
with
the
law
and
the
seizing
officers
could
legitimately
rely
on
those
decisions.
even
more,
significant
is
the
disruptive
effect
upon
the
administration
of
justice
in
applying
marchetti
retroactively
in
this
forfeiture
context.
i’d
indicated
the
extent
of
the
case
is
presently
pending
and
the
money
involved
in
these
various
forfeitures.
we
are
further
advised
by
internal
revenue
service
that
since
1951
when
these
gambling
statutes
were
enacted,
and
i
use
their
phrase
literally
thousands
of
items
used
in
gambling,
automobiles
and
money
have
been
forfeit
under
the
wagering
tax
statute.
we
have
set
forth
some
of
these
figures
--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
well,
the
reason
i
cannot
--
in
the
marchetti-grosso
context.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
the
reason
i
think
that
i
cannot
urge
that
is
two-fold.
one,
this
court
dealt
with
grosso
which
involved
a
claim
other
than
--
a
claim,
an
addition
to
the
claim
there
made,
the
claim
of
marchetti-grosso
and
remanded
it,
the
court
in
stone
sent
--
remanded
all
the
cases
pending
on
appeal
when
marchetti-grosso
was
decided.
and
while
the
court
did
not
focus
upon
the
reasons
for
it,
is
it
is
plain
that
the
court
has
concluded
that
case
is
pending
upon
appeal
--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
well,
you
have
not
said
that
and
as
i
say,
the
court
has
not
spoken
on
the
matter
at
all.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
it
might
be
and
if
that
is
true,
then
it
seems
to
us
that
it
counsels
favorably
as
to
retroactivity
on
collateral
attack.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
right.
the
government’s
position
as
if
it
were
an
open
matter
on
that
supposition
is
that
marchetti-grosso
should
apply
prospectively.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
under
the
--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
january
29,
1968.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
the
stovall,
and
johnson-desist
approach.
all
i
was
suggesting
was
the
--
even
if
the
court
deems
that
what
had
done
following
marchetti-grosso
doesn’t
require
it
to
do
the
same
things
the
case
is
pending
on
collateral
attack,
but
as
--
in
answer
to
your
precise
question
mr.
justice
white,
our
view
would
be
prospectivity,
if
that
question
is
open.
i
would
like
to
save
what
remaining
time
i
have
for
rebuttal.
