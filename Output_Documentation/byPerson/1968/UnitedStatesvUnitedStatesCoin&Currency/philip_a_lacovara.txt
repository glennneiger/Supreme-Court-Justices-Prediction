mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
internal
revenue
forfeiture
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
issued
on
the
government's
petition
to
review
a
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit,
holding
that
a
claim
of
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
under
principles
announced
last
term
by
this
court
in
the
marchetti
and
grosso
decisions
precludes
forfeiture
of
property
used
in
violation
of
the
wagering
tax
act.
the
factual
background
of
the
case
can
be
stated
briefly.
as
a
result
of
investigation
by
the
internal
revenue
service
and
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
into
non-pari-mutuel
betting
at
sportsman's
park
race
track
in
cicero,
illinois
in
the
summer
of
1963.
federal
agents
pursuant
to
a
warrant
arrested
donald
angelini,
the
claimant
in
this
case
at
sportsman's
park
on
august
24,
1963.
when
mr.
angelini
was
taken
to
be
booked,
it
was
found
that
in
his
pockets,
he
held
$8,674.00,
the
respondent
money
in
this
case.
mr.
angelini
was
subsequently
indicted
and
convicted
on
two
counts
for
violating
the
wagering
tax
act
and
over,
he
was
sentenced
to
60
days
in
prison
and
a
$2,500.00
fine.
over
his
objection
that
application
of
the
act
to
him
violated
his
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
the
seventh
circuit
affirmed
in
this
court
in
october
of
1965
denied
certiorari.
in
the
meantime
in
february
1964,
the
government
instituted
this
present
proceeding
a
libel
in
rem
against
the
money
that
had
been
seized
from
mr.
angelini
when
he
was
arrested.
at
the
trial
on
this
libel,
the
government
produced
approximately
a
dozen
internal
revenue
and
federal
bureau
of
investigation
agents
who
testified
their
observations
of
non-pari-mutuel
betting
at
sportsman's
park
and
to
mr.
angelini's
role
in
it.
it
was
also
stipulated
that
although
mr.
angelini
had
registered
as
a
gambler
for
the
fiscal
years
1957
and
1958,
he
had
not
applied
for
or
paying
the
$50.00
wagering
occupational
tax
for
the
period
covering
august
1963.
the
district
judge
jury
trial
not
having
been
demanded
made
findings
of
fact
and
conclusions
of
law
in
which
he
agreed
that
an
illicit
wagering
business
had
been
conducted
at
sportsman's
park,
and
that
the
--
that
no
person
receiving
wagers
non-pari-mutuel
wagers
at
the
park
had
paid
the
$50.00
occupational
tax,
and
he
further
found
that
the
respondent
money
in
this
case
had
been
used
in
the
course
of
that
violation
of
the
internal
revenue
laws.
accordingly,
under
section
7302
of
the
internal
revenue
code,
the
money
in
this
case
was
ordered
forfeit
to
the
united
states.
the
seventh
circuit
affirmed
again
over
self-incrimination
objections
and
the
case
was
pending
here
on
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
when
this
court
decided
marchetti
and
grosso
last
term.
shortly
thereafter,
the
petition
was
granted
and
the
case
remanded
to
the
seventh
circuit
for
reconsideration
in
light
of
marchetti
and
grosso.
on
remand,
seventh
circuit
without
further
brief
in
their
argument
determined
that
the
principles
announced
by
the
court
did
indeed
apply
to
the
forfeiture
of
property
used
in
violation
of
the
wagering
tax
act
and
it
reversed
the
decree
of
forfeiture
because
the
sixth
circuit
subsequently
explicitly
rejected
the
seventh
circuit's
ruling
in
this
case
and
held
that
the
forfeiture
provisions
that
are
here
in
question
are
remedial
rather
than
penal
that
the
privilege
does
not
constitute
a
substantive
defense
in
this
type
of
in
rem
action.
the
government
therefore
petitioned
for
certiorari
to
resolve
the
conflict
among
the
circuits.
our
position
is
that
the
critical
difference
between
a
criminal
proceeding,
such
as
the
proceedings
involved
in
marchetti
and
grosso
and
an
in
rem
forfeiture
which
is
directed
both
in
form
and
in
substance
against
defending
property
and
is
remedial
rather
than
punitive
serves
to
distinguished
grosso
and
marchetti
and
the
spirit
and
letter
of
the
fifth
amendment
from
proceedings
like
the
present
one.
our
contention
is
that
the
heart
of
the
decision
below
wherein
lies
critical
error
was
the
assertion
by
the
seventh
circuit
that
the
application
of
the
general
forfeiture
statutes
in
the
internal
revenue
code
in
circumstances
like
these
have
is
there
only
purpose,
the
punishment
of
individuals
for
violation
of
the
wagering
tax
act.
the
court
said
that
since
it's
a
practical
matter,
marchetti
and
grosso
established
that
individuals
cannot
be
punished
criminally
for
that
sort
of
conduct.
it
follows
that
they
may
not
be
punished
indirectly
by
forfeiture.
while
we
would
be
prepared
to
reject
the
logic
that
the
direct
--
the
indirect
consequences
intolerable
simply
because
direct
criminal
prosecution
is
also
barred.
we
think
the
basic
error
that
the
court
committed
was
in
asserting
without
any
discussion
whatsoever
that
the
basic
purpose,
the
only
purpose
the
seventh
circuit
said
of
forfeitures
like
the
present
one
is
a
penal
purpose.
on
the
contrary,
we
submit
a
review
of
the
historical
and
legal
aspects
of
internal
revenue
forfeitures
establishes
that
they
are
not
penal.
they
are
not
directed
either
in
essence
or
in
objective
at
punishing
an
individual
for
his
violation
of
the
internal
revenue
code.
they
are
not
designed
to
penalize
anyone
for
his
invocation
or
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
rather
we
submit
they
are
remedial
in
the
sense
that
they
provide
an
alternative
for
assuring
an
adequate
flow
of
revenue
into
the
treasury.
we
say
that
historically,
this
is
true
because
this
court
relying
on
past
english
decisions
has
consistently
differentiated
internal
revenue
forfeitures
under
statutes
from
the
common
law
type
of
forfeiture
which
attached
directly
to
an
individual
upon
his
criminal
conviction.
a
felon's
goods
at
common
law
were
forfeit
and
all
of
the
crown
needed
to
do
to
obtain
his
property
was
to
demonstrate
that
he
had
been
convicted
of
a
crime.
on
the
contrary,
is
this
court
itself
carefully
pointed
out
in
the
boyd
decision
on
which
claimant
principally
relies
in
which
the
court
below
termed
controlling
internal
revenue
forfeitures
which
have
dated
in
this
country
from
the
first
revenue
act
of
1789
are
directed
at
a
different
purpose,
their
object
is
not
criminal
punishment
as
the
court
found
the
particular
forfeiture
statute
in
boyd
was,
but
merely
at
remedying
a
default
on
the
treasury
a
non-payment
of
a
valid
tax.
we
start
in
this
case
by
assuming
that
the
court
in
marchetti
and
grosso
did
not
hold
that
the
wagering
tax
act
is
invalid
in
the
sense
that
it
does
not
impose
civil
liability
for
the
tax.
we
think
this
is
a
fair
assumption
because,
in
our
view,
the
court
went
to
great
pains
to
point
out
that
nothing
in
the
decisions
was
to
extinguish
civil
liability
even
in
the
face
of
the
privilege,
but
was
simply
to
preclude
criminal
punishment
in
the
face
of
a
proper
invocation
of
the
privilege.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
resume
this
morning
by
restating
briefly
the
government's
basic
position
in
this
internal
revenue
forfeiture
case
and
it
is
that
unlike
marchetti
and
grosso
which
involved
criminal
punishment
for
refusing
to
come
forward
to
disclose
information
that
would
have
been
incriminatory.
internal
revenue
forfeitures
of
the
type
involved
in
this
case
do
not
involve
any
punishment
for
anyone's
invocation
of
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination,
rather
we
submit
unlike
the
common
law
type
of
forfeiture
which
attached
in
persona
upon
the
criminal
conviction
of
a
felon.
internal
revenue
forfeitures
historically
and
legally
are
quite
different,
critically
different
we
think
for
these
purposes,
and
that
liability
or
guilt
if
you
choose
to
use
that
term
attaches
directly
for
the
--
to
the
property
and
not
to
any
person,
and
the
forfeiture
is
not
punishment
directed
at
anyone,
but
a
simply
a
remedial
device
for
safeguarding
the
public
fisc.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
normally,
the
property
belongs
to
someone,
yes.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
the
idea
(voice
overlap)
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
that's
right.
the
forfeiture
statutes
like
the
one
in
question
declare
that
property
rights
shall
not
exist
in
property
in
physical
items
any
longer
after
certain
conditions
are
met.
so,
there
is
undoubtedly
an
item
that
was
at
one
point,
someone's
property
which
no
longer
is
his.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
this
was
$8,674.00
which
belonged
to
someone
we
know
not,
donald
angelini
claims
the
property.
it
was
in
his
pocket.
it
was
seized
when
he
was
arrested
at
sportsman's
park
in
august
of
1964.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
that's
right.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
that's
correct.
we
think
that
indicates
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
pardon
me?
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
the
amount
of
--
it's
a
forfeiture,
the
value
of
the
forfeitures
unrelated
to
the
amount
of
tax
liability
that
the
individual
has.
but
i
think
it's
important
to
point
out
that
the
items
which
were
the
property
of
an
individual
are
not
necessarily
owned
by
the
person
who
has
the
tax
liability,
and
that's
the
essence
of
our
position
in
arguing
that
internal
revenue
forfeitures
are
not
penal.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
i
think
we
have
a
much
more
difficult
case
your
honor
and
i
think
boyd
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
boyd
i
think
would
then
be
--
would
probably
be
controlling
in
that
situation.
we
think
though
that
boyd
as
explained
by
this
court
in
the
case
in
which
we
principally
rely
helvering
against
mitchell
in
303
u.s.
explained
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
justice
brandeis'
opinion
over
the
sole
of
dissent
of
justice
mcreynolds.
justice
brandeis
explained
that
boyd
was
careful
to
distinguished
between
penal
and
remedial
forfeitures
and
of
course,
justice
bradley's
opinion
does
make
that
careful
distinction
and
determines
that
the
forfeiture
in
that
case
was
one
that
was
penal
in
the
common
law
sense
and
that
it
attached
because
of
the
particular
individuals,
criminal
liability,
and
justice
bradley
said
that
the
government
in
that
case
could
have
proceeded
directly
against
the
owner
of
the
property
for
committing
the
crime
and
included
in
the
judgment
of
criminal
conviction,
could
have
been
a
decree
forfeiting
this
property.
that
was
the
common
law
method
of
forfeiting
property.
justice
bradley
carefully
distinguished
however
the
statutory
forfeitures
which
are
unconcerned
with
anyone's
criminal
conviction
or
even
with
anyone's
amenability
to
criminal
prosecution.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
that
they
are
two
purposes.
two
purposes
i'd
say.
one
is
to
remove
from
circulation,
the
physical
means,
the
where
would
all
by
which
an
activity
has
been
carried
on
in
violation
of
the
internal
revenue
law
so
that
tax
liability
has
not
been
paid.
this
prevents
a
repetition
of
the
same
offense.
it's
easiest
to
visualize
in
the
case
of
(voice
overlap)
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
conducting
a
wagering
business
on
which
the
occupational
and
excise
tax
has
had
not
been
paid.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
that's
correct.
the
cases
and
the
statute
focus
on
the
use
of
the
property
in
a
way
that
is
inconsistent
the
way
in
violation
of
the
revenue
laws,
it's
carrying
on
in
untaxed
business.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
i'm
sorry,
i
don't
see
that.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
well,
this
was
the
distinction
i
was
trying
to
draw
before.
the
money
is
not
necessarily
his.
the
money
is
owned
or
(voice
overlap)
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
it
sometimes
is.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
in
the
event,
the
individual
has
no
more
funds
than
are
actually
seized
from
him
because
they've
been
used
in
violation
of
the
tax.
i
don't
think
that
the
public
revenues
or
in
any
way
harm
because
by
definition
in
that
situation,
the
government
could
not
have
obtained
the
any
greater
tax
revenues
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
no,
for
the
simple
reason
that
the
seizures
unrelated
to
his
tax
liability
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
the
second
purpose,
again
explained
in
helvering
against
mitchell
is
that
this
type
of
forfeiture
makes
the
government
hold
for
the
cost
of
investigating
a
tax
default,
and
it
reimburses
for
the
additional
amount
of
time
and
effort
that
it
takes
to
investigate
a
tax
liability
which
has
not
been
satisfied
by
voluntary
response.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
oh,
it's
--
i
wouldn't
say
it
has
no
role
or
no
effect
in
encouraging
people
to
pay
their
taxes,
but
it's
not
primarily
designed
for
that
purpose
and
historically,
it's
focused
is
not
upon
the
individual
who
has
failed
to
pay
the
tax.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
oh,
i
think
i
have
to
concede
i'd
be
in
slightly
worst
shape,
but
i
think
i'd
be
prepared
to
defend
that
because
i
was
saying
yesterday,
the
linchpin
of
our
argument
is
the
continuing
validity
of
this
wagering
tax.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
no,
i
won't
concede
that
and
the
reason
is
this.
the
court,
as
far
as
i
know,
has
not
established
a
blanket
rule
that
no
sanction
can
attach
to
the
invocation
of
the
privilege.
we
think
that
the
case
that's
closest
to
this
conceptually
is
the
decision
in
campbell
painting
company
versus
reid
last
term
in
which
as
the
court
will
well
remember.
a
new
york
statute
which
the
court
itself
termed
one
that
was
intended
to
levy
a
penalty
in
order
to
deter
people
from
invoking
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination,
provided
that
a
corporation
which
had
contracts,
corporation
or
individual
which
had
contracts
with
the
state
would
be
ineligible
for
further
contracts
and
would
have
its
present
contract
cancelled
if
an
officer
or
the
individual
having
the
contract
refuse
to
testify
before
a
grand
jury
and
waive
his
privilege.
in
that
decision
over
the
dissent
which
pointed
out
that
the
financial
consequences
of
this
cancellation,
were
going
to
fall
directly
upon
the
individual
who
would
invoke
the
privilege
because
he
was
of
the
president
of
a
corporation
and
the
principal
shareholder.
the
court
nevertheless
held
that
the
corporation
was
in
no
position
to
take
advantage
of
a
penalty
imposed
because
of
the
president's
invocation
of
the
privilege.
we
think
this
case
is
a
fortiori
because
we
reject
the
notion
that
--
and
sixth
circuit
in
dean
is
held
and
this
court
in
helvering
and
other
forfeiture
case
have
held
that
forfeitures
are
to
penalize
anyone.
but
in
any
event
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
well,
if
he
had
not
paid
the
excise
taxes,
the
operation
would
still
have
been
conducted
in
violation
of
the
wagering
tax
act.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
no,
that's
not
true
either
because
at
the
--
the
records
shows
that
at
sportsman's
park,
there
were
other
individuals
apparently
working
for
or
at
least
with
mr.
angelini
in
taking
non-pari-mutuel
wagers.
if
any
of
those
individuals
were
not
registered,
had
not
paid
the
occupational
tax,
the
money
that
they
collected
would
still
have
been
collected
and
used
as
the
statute
says
in
violation
of
the
internal
revenue
law.
so,
even
though
the
money
was
not
handed
to
angelini
who
is
lawfully
registered,
it
was
still
subject
to
seizure.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
that's
correct.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
assuming
they'd
all
comply
with
the
internal
revenue
statutes,
there'd
be
no
basis
for
seizure
on
the
statutes.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
the
absence
of
the
stamp
is
certainly
the
ingredient
in
this
case
as
far
as
we
were
endeavored
to
prove
that
made
this
money
either
misused
in
violation
of
the
internal
revenue
laws.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
we
have
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
we
have
to
prove
that
someone
was
gambling
and
that
this
money
was
used
in
the
course
of
an
unregistered
gambling
operation.
the
government
of
course
bears
the
entire
burden
of
proof.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
that's
why
it's
quite
different
from
the
boyd
case
(voice
overlap)
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
well,
that's
true,
but
of
course
in
grosso
and
marchetti,
the
same
thing
was
true,
but
the
court
said
we
couldn't
prosecute.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
because
the
occupational
tax
in
section
4411
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes,
the
stamp
evidence
(voice
overlap)
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
no,
section
--
the
next
section,
the
4412
says
that
people
required
to
pay
the
occupational
tax
are
also
required
to
register.
in
fact,
as
the
court
said
in
marchetti,
the
two
things
are
handled
(voice
overlap)
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
well,
i
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
the
court
said
quite
correctly
in
marchetti
that
the
two
are
integrally
related
and
it's
impossible
to
pay
the
occupational
tax
without
registering.
so,
i
don't
try
to
make
any
distinction
on
that
point.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
no,
the
cases
are
fairly
clear,
these
statutes
are
not
new
and
they
have
been
construed
on
literary
hundreds
of
occasions.
it
has
to
be
some
property
which
is
integrally
related
to
the
violation
of
the
statute.
now,
perhaps
if
you're
adding
machine
had
been
involved
in
your
computation
of
your
tax
liability
and
if
you
had
violated
the
internal
revenue
laws
by
deliberately
failing
to
pay.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
even
your
pen
and
pencil,
that's
true,
but
your
house
wouldn't
be
seized
or
your
car.
it's
only
the
property
as
the
statute
says
that
is
used
in
violation
of
the
statute.
in
the
cases,
including
the
cases
relied
on
by
the
claimant,
the
various
court
of
appeals
decisions
say
that
the
focus
is
on
the
use
of
the
property
and
that
--
there
doesn't
have
to
be
any
specific
intent
to
violate
any
particular
internal
revenue
statute.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
well,
ah
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
exactly,
it's
a
fiction
and
no
one
contest
that
but
it's
one
that
we
think
has
some
meaningful
content
to
it
and
its
one
that
the
court
in
goldsmith
grant
case
in
284
u.s.
said
is
so
firmly
fixed
in
anglo-american
jurisprudence
that
in
the
absence
of
compelling
circumstances
that
i
don't
think
are
presented
in
this
case.
the
court
should
be
reluctant
to
repudiate
600
years
of
our
jurisprudence.
it's
a
fiction,
but
--
because
it
does
historically
and
legally
operate,
irrespective
of
the
criminal
liability
of
the
owner,
and
because
this
court
is
consistently
sustained
the
constitutionality
of
this
type
of
forfeiture,
we
think
it
critical
that
these
statutes
do
not
focus
upon
the
criminal
liability
of
the
owner
or
the
possibility
that
he
might
be
able
to
resist
prosecution
as
in
marchetti
and
grosso
by
invoking
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
the
focus
in
this
case,
this
type
of
forfeiture
is
on
the
property's
use,
and
we
think
that
since
property
clearly
has
no
privilege
against
self-incrimination,
it's
inherently
a
personal
privilege.
we
think
the
case
follows
rather
logically
from
the
campbell
painting
case
where
the
court
said
there,
the
actual
focus
of
the
penalty
in
that
case,
again,
i
reiterate
that
we
do
not
consider
this
type
of
forfeiture
penalty
and
this
court
has
never
treated
as
such.
but
in
campbell
painting,
the
penalty
focused
on
a
corporation
which
has
no
privilege,
and
the
court
said,
the
corporation
therefore
is
in
no
position
to
complain
that
an
individual,
that
the
occasion
for
the
penalty
has
been
the
invocation
of
the
privilege
by
an
individual.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
i
think
as
a
factual
matter,
we
can
say
fairly
confidently
that
it
does
not
provide
any
great
impetus
to
an
individual
to
come
forward
and
register.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
or
to
pay
the
tax,
because
in
fact,
the
--
as
this
case
illustrates;
the
man
is
not
terribly
disadvantaged
by
the
seizure
of
this
property.
this
was
the
bankroll
used
in
conducting
an
illicit
business.
it's
just
one
of
the
risks
of
the
game.
i
think,
it
could
be
fairly
said
that
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
the
worst
that
can
happen
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
the
worst
that
can
happen
is
that
money
which
has
been
used
in
violation
of
this
act
which
may
or
may
not
belong
to
me.
in
the
dean
case
in
the
sixth
circuit,
$300,000.00
is
involved
and
the
district
court
said
even
now
we
seized
from
the
home
of
the
dean's,
it
apparently
did
not
all
belong
to
them
because
they
provided
the
banking
clearing
house
for
the
gambling
operation.
i
think
that
illustrates
that
the
lost
does
not
necessarily
fall
on
the
person
who
otherwise
would
be
compelled
to
come
forward
to
pay
the
tax
and
to
register.
it's
not
a
direct
cause
on
axis,
prompting
him
to
give
incriminatory
information.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
it's
paid
to
the
treasurer
as
part
of
internal
revenue
collections.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
the
government
--
yes,
the
money
is
covered
into
the
general
treasury.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
the
government
can
either
use
them
if
seizing
agency
so
determines
or
it
can
auction
them
off.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
literary?
mr.
philip

lacovara
literary,
dozens;
that
is
very
violations
of

dozens
of
acts
can
result
in
certain
types
of
forfeitures.
there
not
all,
we
can
see
internal
revenue
forfeitures,
some
i
think
would
be
--
we
would
have
to
in
candor
concede
would
be
more
of
the
penal
kind
in
this
type
of
case.

philip

lacovara
the
liquor
laws.
violation
of
the
laws
regulating
distilleries
free
(voice
overlap)
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes,
sir.
i
would
like
to
say
that
we
have
argued
that
in
the
event,
the
court
determines
that
marchetti
and
grosso
should
apply
to
forfeitures
of
this
type.
the
decision
should
not
be
made
retroactive
and
should
apply
only
to
seizures
made
after
the
date
of
those
decisions.
we
think
the
court's
power
to
make
new
constitutional
rules
prospective
only
now
as
well
settled,
and
that
each
of
the
three
factors
to
be
considered
counsels
prospective
application
in
this
case.
we
have
discussed
the
effect
and
the
reliance
in
our
brief.
i
would
like
to
say
that
in
terms
of
the
purpose
of
the
new
rule,
we
suggest
that
the
protection
of
the
fifth
amendment
which
would
be
the
essential
purpose
of
this
rule
would
not
be
measurably
advanced
by
applying
it
in
this
type
of
case,
applying
it
retroactively
when
by
definition,
the
individual
has
not
come
forward
to
waive
his
privilege
and
has
not
given
any
information
which
would
be
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
no,
it
would
have
a
result
in
a
reversal
because
the
seizure
(voice
overlap)
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
no,
we
are
the
petitioner
mr.
justice
douglas,
the
seventh
circuit
has
reversed
the
decree
of
forfeiture
and
our
proposed
judgment
of
at
least
would
say
the
forfeiture,
that
the
application
of
the
fifth
amendment
should
not
bar
seizures
which
took
place
as
in
this
case,
four
and
a
half
years
before
grosso
and
marchetti,
so
that
the
seventh
circuit's
judgment
should
be
reversed.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
no,
the
rule
that
i'm
saying
should
be
made
prospective.
if
the
court
rejects
our
basic
position
is
that
grosso
and
marchetti
can
const
--
or
the
principles
announced
therein,
can
constitute
a
substantive
defense
to
an
internal
revenue
forfeiture
proceeding.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
and
in
that
situation,
that
rule
would
not
apply
at
this
proceeding
and
the
government
would
be
entitled
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
--
$3,000.00.
i'd
like
to
save
any
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
apparently,
that's
academic.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
internal
revenue
forfeiture
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
issued
on
the
government's
petition
to
review
a
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit,
holding
that
a
claim
of
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
under
principles
announced
last
term
by
this
court
in
the
marchetti
and
grosso
decisions
precludes
forfeiture
of
property
used
in
violation
of
the
wagering
tax
act.
the
factual
background
of
the
case
can
be
stated
briefly.
as
a
result
of
investigation
by
the
internal
revenue
service
and
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
into
non-pari-mutuel
betting
at
sportsman's
park
race
track
in
cicero,
illinois
in
the
summer
of
1963.
federal
agents
pursuant
to
a
warrant
arrested
donald
angelini,
the
claimant
in
this
case
at
sportsman's
park
on
august
24,
1963.
when
mr.
angelini
was
taken
to
be
booked,
it
was
found
that
in
his
pockets,
he
held
$8,674.00,
the
respondent
money
in
this
case.
mr.
angelini
was
subsequently
indicted
and
convicted
on
two
counts
for
violating
the
wagering
tax
act
and
over,
he
was
sentenced
to
60
days
in
prison
and
a
$2,500.00
fine.
over
his
objection
that
application
of
the
act
to
him
violated
his
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
the
seventh
circuit
affirmed
in
this
court
in
october
of
1965
denied
certiorari.
in
the
meantime
in
february
1964,
the
government
instituted
this
present
proceeding
a
libel
in
rem
against
the
money
that
had
been
seized
from
mr.
angelini
when
he
was
arrested.
at
the
trial
on
this
libel,
the
government
produced
approximately
a
dozen
internal
revenue
and
federal
bureau
of
investigation
agents
who
testified
their
observations
of
non-pari-mutuel
betting
at
sportsman's
park
and
to
mr.
angelini's
role
in
it.
it
was
also
stipulated
that
although
mr.
angelini
had
registered
as
a
gambler
for
the
fiscal
years
1957
and
1958,
he
had
not
applied
for
or
paying
the
$50.00
wagering
occupational
tax
for
the
period
covering
august
1963.
the
district
judge
jury
trial
not
having
been
demanded
made
findings
of
fact
and
conclusions
of
law
in
which
he
agreed
that
an
illicit
wagering
business
had
been
conducted
at
sportsman's
park,
and
that
the
--
that
no
person
receiving
wagers
non-pari-mutuel
wagers
at
the
park
had
paid
the
$50.00
occupational
tax,
and
he
further
found
that
the
respondent
money
in
this
case
had
been
used
in
the
course
of
that
violation
of
the
internal
revenue
laws.
accordingly,
under
section
7302
of
the
internal
revenue
code,
the
money
in
this
case
was
ordered
forfeit
to
the
united
states.
the
seventh
circuit
affirmed
again
over
self-incrimination
objections
and
the
case
was
pending
here
on
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
when
this
court
decided
marchetti
and
grosso
last
term.
shortly
thereafter,
the
petition
was
granted
and
the
case
remanded
to
the
seventh
circuit
for
reconsideration
in
light
of
marchetti
and
grosso.
on
remand,
seventh
circuit
without
further
brief
in
their
argument
determined
that
the
principles
announced
by
the
court
did
indeed
apply
to
the
forfeiture
of
property
used
in
violation
of
the
wagering
tax
act
and
it
reversed
the
decree
of
forfeiture
because
the
sixth
circuit
subsequently
explicitly
rejected
the
seventh
circuit's
ruling
in
this
case
and
held
that
the
forfeiture
provisions
that
are
here
in
question
are
remedial
rather
than
penal
that
the
privilege
does
not
constitute
a
substantive
defense
in
this
type
of
in
rem
action.
the
government
therefore
petitioned
for
certiorari
to
resolve
the
conflict
among
the
circuits.
our
position
is
that
the
critical
difference
between
a
criminal
proceeding,
such
as
the
proceedings
involved
in
marchetti
and
grosso
and
an
in
rem
forfeiture
which
is
directed
both
in
form
and
in
substance
against
defending
property
and
is
remedial
rather
than
punitive
serves
to
distinguished
grosso
and
marchetti
and
the
spirit
and
letter
of
the
fifth
amendment
from
proceedings
like
the
present
one.
our
contention
is
that
the
heart
of
the
decision
below
wherein
lies
critical
error
was
the
assertion
by
the
seventh
circuit
that
the
application
of
the
general
forfeiture
statutes
in
the
internal
revenue
code
in
circumstances
like
these
have
is
there
only
purpose,
the
punishment
of
individuals
for
violation
of
the
wagering
tax
act.
the
court
said
that
since
it's
a
practical
matter,
marchetti
and
grosso
established
that
individuals
cannot
be
punished
criminally
for
that
sort
of
conduct.
it
follows
that
they
may
not
be
punished
indirectly
by
forfeiture.
while
we
would
be
prepared
to
reject
the
logic
that
the
direct
--
the
indirect
consequences
intolerable
simply
because
direct
criminal
prosecution
is
also
barred.
we
think
the
basic
error
that
the
court
committed
was
in
asserting
without
any
discussion
whatsoever
that
the
basic
purpose,
the
only
purpose
the
seventh
circuit
said
of
forfeitures
like
the
present
one
is
a
penal
purpose.
on
the
contrary,
we
submit
a
review
of
the
historical
and
legal
aspects
of
internal
revenue
forfeitures
establishes
that
they
are
not
penal.
they
are
not
directed
either
in
essence
or
in
objective
at
punishing
an
individual
for
his
violation
of
the
internal
revenue
code.
they
are
not
designed
to
penalize
anyone
for
his
invocation
or
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
rather
we
submit
they
are
remedial
in
the
sense
that
they
provide
an
alternative
for
assuring
an
adequate
flow
of
revenue
into
the
treasury.
we
say
that
historically,
this
is
true
because
this
court
relying
on
past
english
decisions
has
consistently
differentiated
internal
revenue
forfeitures
under
statutes
from
the
common
law
type
of
forfeiture
which
attached
directly
to
an
individual
upon
his
criminal
conviction.
a
felon's
goods
at
common
law
were
forfeit
and
all
of
the
crown
needed
to
do
to
obtain
his
property
was
to
demonstrate
that
he
had
been
convicted
of
a
crime.
on
the
contrary,
is
this
court
itself
carefully
pointed
out
in
the
boyd
decision
on
which
claimant
principally
relies
in
which
the
court
below
termed
controlling
internal
revenue
forfeitures
which
have
dated
in
this
country
from
the
first
revenue
act
of
1789
are
directed
at
a
different
purpose,
their
object
is
not
criminal
punishment
as
the
court
found
the
particular
forfeiture
statute
in
boyd
was,
but
merely
at
remedying
a
default
on
the
treasury
a
non-payment
of
a
valid
tax.
we
start
in
this
case
by
assuming
that
the
court
in
marchetti
and
grosso
did
not
hold
that
the
wagering
tax
act
is
invalid
in
the
sense
that
it
does
not
impose
civil
liability
for
the
tax.
we
think
this
is
a
fair
assumption
because,
in
our
view,
the
court
went
to
great
pains
to
point
out
that
nothing
in
the
decisions
was
to
extinguish
civil
liability
even
in
the
face
of
the
privilege,
but
was
simply
to
preclude
criminal
punishment
in
the
face
of
a
proper
invocation
of
the
privilege.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
resume
this
morning
by
restating
briefly
the
government's
basic
position
in
this
internal
revenue
forfeiture
case
and
it
is
that
unlike
marchetti
and
grosso
which
involved
criminal
punishment
for
refusing
to
come
forward
to
disclose
information
that
would
have
been
incriminatory.
internal
revenue
forfeitures
of
the
type
involved
in
this
case
do
not
involve
any
punishment
for
anyone's
invocation
of
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination,
rather
we
submit
unlike
the
common
law
type
of
forfeiture
which
attached
in
persona
upon
the
criminal
conviction
of
a
felon.
internal
revenue
forfeitures
historically
and
legally
are
quite
different,
critically
different
we
think
for
these
purposes,
and
that
liability
or
guilt
if
you
choose
to
use
that
term
attaches
directly
for
the
--
to
the
property
and
not
to
any
person,
and
the
forfeiture
is
not
punishment
directed
at
anyone,
but
a
simply
a
remedial
device
for
safeguarding
the
public
fisc.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
normally,
the
property
belongs
to
someone,
yes.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
the
idea
(voice
overlap)
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
that's
right.
the
forfeiture
statutes
like
the
one
in
question
declare
that
property
rights
shall
not
exist
in
property
in
physical
items
any
longer
after
certain
conditions
are
met.
so,
there
is
undoubtedly
an
item
that
was
at
one
point,
someone's
property
which
no
longer
is
his.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
this
was
$8,674.00
which
belonged
to
someone
we
know
not,
donald
angelini
claims
the
property.
it
was
in
his
pocket.
it
was
seized
when
he
was
arrested
at
sportsman's
park
in
august
of
1964.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
that's
right.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
that's
correct.
we
think
that
indicates
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
pardon
me?
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
the
amount
of
--
it's
a
forfeiture,
the
value
of
the
forfeitures
unrelated
to
the
amount
of
tax
liability
that
the
individual
has.
but
i
think
it's
important
to
point
out
that
the
items
which
were
the
property
of
an
individual
are
not
necessarily
owned
by
the
person
who
has
the
tax
liability,
and
that's
the
essence
of
our
position
in
arguing
that
internal
revenue
forfeitures
are
not
penal.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
i
think
we
have
a
much
more
difficult
case
your
honor
and
i
think
boyd
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
boyd
i
think
would
then
be
--
would
probably
be
controlling
in
that
situation.
we
think
though
that
boyd
as
explained
by
this
court
in
the
case
in
which
we
principally
rely
helvering
against
mitchell
in
303
u.s.
explained
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
justice
brandeis'
opinion
over
the
sole
of
dissent
of
justice
mcreynolds.
justice
brandeis
explained
that
boyd
was
careful
to
distinguished
between
penal
and
remedial
forfeitures
and
of
course,
justice
bradley's
opinion
does
make
that
careful
distinction
and
determines
that
the
forfeiture
in
that
case
was
one
that
was
penal
in
the
common
law
sense
and
that
it
attached
because
of
the
particular
individuals,
criminal
liability,
and
justice
bradley
said
that
the
government
in
that
case
could
have
proceeded
directly
against
the
owner
of
the
property
for
committing
the
crime
and
included
in
the
judgment
of
criminal
conviction,
could
have
been
a
decree
forfeiting
this
property.
that
was
the
common
law
method
of
forfeiting
property.
justice
bradley
carefully
distinguished
however
the
statutory
forfeitures
which
are
unconcerned
with
anyone's
criminal
conviction
or
even
with
anyone's
amenability
to
criminal
prosecution.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
that
they
are
two
purposes.
two
purposes
i'd
say.
one
is
to
remove
from
circulation,
the
physical
means,
the
where
would
all
by
which
an
activity
has
been
carried
on
in
violation
of
the
internal
revenue
law
so
that
tax
liability
has
not
been
paid.
this
prevents
a
repetition
of
the
same
offense.
it's
easiest
to
visualize
in
the
case
of
(voice
overlap)
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
conducting
a
wagering
business
on
which
the
occupational
and
excise
tax
has
had
not
been
paid.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
that's
correct.
the
cases
and
the
statute
focus
on
the
use
of
the
property
in
a
way
that
is
inconsistent
the
way
in
violation
of
the
revenue
laws,
it's
carrying
on
in
untaxed
business.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
i'm
sorry,
i
don't
see
that.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
well,
this
was
the
distinction
i
was
trying
to
draw
before.
the
money
is
not
necessarily
his.
the
money
is
owned
or
(voice
overlap)
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
it
sometimes
is.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
in
the
event,
the
individual
has
no
more
funds
than
are
actually
seized
from
him
because
they've
been
used
in
violation
of
the
tax.
i
don't
think
that
the
public
revenues
or
in
any
way
harm
because
by
definition
in
that
situation,
the
government
could
not
have
obtained
the
any
greater
tax
revenues
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
no,
for
the
simple
reason
that
the
seizures
unrelated
to
his
tax
liability
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
the
second
purpose,
again
explained
in
helvering
against
mitchell
is
that
this
type
of
forfeiture
makes
the
government
hold
for
the
cost
of
investigating
a
tax
default,
and
it
reimburses
for
the
additional
amount
of
time
and
effort
that
it
takes
to
investigate
a
tax
liability
which
has
not
been
satisfied
by
voluntary
response.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
oh,
it's
--
i
wouldn't
say
it
has
no
role
or
no
effect
in
encouraging
people
to
pay
their
taxes,
but
it's
not
primarily
designed
for
that
purpose
and
historically,
it's
focused
is
not
upon
the
individual
who
has
failed
to
pay
the
tax.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
oh,
i
think
i
have
to
concede
i'd
be
in
slightly
worst
shape,
but
i
think
i'd
be
prepared
to
defend
that
because
i
was
saying
yesterday,
the
linchpin
of
our
argument
is
the
continuing
validity
of
this
wagering
tax.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
no,
i
won't
concede
that
and
the
reason
is
this.
the
court,
as
far
as
i
know,
has
not
established
a
blanket
rule
that
no
sanction
can
attach
to
the
invocation
of
the
privilege.
we
think
that
the
case
that's
closest
to
this
conceptually
is
the
decision
in
campbell
painting
company
versus
reid
last
term
in
which
as
the
court
will
well
remember.
a
new
york
statute
which
the
court
itself
termed
one
that
was
intended
to
levy
a
penalty
in
order
to
deter
people
from
invoking
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination,
provided
that
a
corporation
which
had
contracts,
corporation
or
individual
which
had
contracts
with
the
state
would
be
ineligible
for
further
contracts
and
would
have
its
present
contract
cancelled
if
an
officer
or
the
individual
having
the
contract
refuse
to
testify
before
a
grand
jury
and
waive
his
privilege.
in
that
decision
over
the
dissent
which
pointed
out
that
the
financial
consequences
of
this
cancellation,
were
going
to
fall
directly
upon
the
individual
who
would
invoke
the
privilege
because
he
was
of
the
president
of
a
corporation
and
the
principal
shareholder.
the
court
nevertheless
held
that
the
corporation
was
in
no
position
to
take
advantage
of
a
penalty
imposed
because
of
the
president's
invocation
of
the
privilege.
we
think
this
case
is
a
fortiori
because
we
reject
the
notion
that
--
and
sixth
circuit
in
dean
is
held
and
this
court
in
helvering
and
other
forfeiture
case
have
held
that
forfeitures
are
to
penalize
anyone.
but
in
any
event
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
well,
if
he
had
not
paid
the
excise
taxes,
the
operation
would
still
have
been
conducted
in
violation
of
the
wagering
tax
act.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
no,
that's
not
true
either
because
at
the
--
the
records
shows
that
at
sportsman's
park,
there
were
other
individuals
apparently
working
for
or
at
least
with
mr.
angelini
in
taking
non-pari-mutuel
wagers.
if
any
of
those
individuals
were
not
registered,
had
not
paid
the
occupational
tax,
the
money
that
they
collected
would
still
have
been
collected
and
used
as
the
statute
says
in
violation
of
the
internal
revenue
law.
so,
even
though
the
money
was
not
handed
to
angelini
who
is
lawfully
registered,
it
was
still
subject
to
seizure.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
that's
correct.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
assuming
they'd
all
comply
with
the
internal
revenue
statutes,
there'd
be
no
basis
for
seizure
on
the
statutes.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
the
absence
of
the
stamp
is
certainly
the
ingredient
in
this
case
as
far
as
we
were
endeavored
to
prove
that
made
this
money
either
misused
in
violation
of
the
internal
revenue
laws.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
we
have
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
we
have
to
prove
that
someone
was
gambling
and
that
this
money
was
used
in
the
course
of
an
unregistered
gambling
operation.
the
government
of
course
bears
the
entire
burden
of
proof.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
that's
why
it's
quite
different
from
the
boyd
case
(voice
overlap)
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
well,
that's
true,
but
of
course
in
grosso
and
marchetti,
the
same
thing
was
true,
but
the
court
said
we
couldn't
prosecute.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
because
the
occupational
tax
in
section
4411
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes,
the
stamp
evidence
(voice
overlap)
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
no,
section
--
the
next
section,
the
4412
says
that
people
required
to
pay
the
occupational
tax
are
also
required
to
register.
in
fact,
as
the
court
said
in
marchetti,
the
two
things
are
handled
(voice
overlap)
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
well,
i
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
the
court
said
quite
correctly
in
marchetti
that
the
two
are
integrally
related
and
it's
impossible
to
pay
the
occupational
tax
without
registering.
so,
i
don't
try
to
make
any
distinction
on
that
point.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
no,
the
cases
are
fairly
clear,
these
statutes
are
not
new
and
they
have
been
construed
on
literary
hundreds
of
occasions.
it
has
to
be
some
property
which
is
integrally
related
to
the
violation
of
the
statute.
now,
perhaps
if
you're
adding
machine
had
been
involved
in
your
computation
of
your
tax
liability
and
if
you
had
violated
the
internal
revenue
laws
by
deliberately
failing
to
pay.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
even
your
pen
and
pencil,
that's
true,
but
your
house
wouldn't
be
seized
or
your
car.
it's
only
the
property
as
the
statute
says
that
is
used
in
violation
of
the
statute.
in
the
cases,
including
the
cases
relied
on
by
the
claimant,
the
various
court
of
appeals
decisions
say
that
the
focus
is
on
the
use
of
the
property
and
that
--
there
doesn't
have
to
be
any
specific
intent
to
violate
any
particular
internal
revenue
statute.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
well,
ah
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
exactly,
it's
a
fiction
and
no
one
contest
that
but
it's
one
that
we
think
has
some
meaningful
content
to
it
and
its
one
that
the
court
in
goldsmith
grant
case
in
284
u.s.
said
is
so
firmly
fixed
in
anglo-american
jurisprudence
that
in
the
absence
of
compelling
circumstances
that
i
don't
think
are
presented
in
this
case.
the
court
should
be
reluctant
to
repudiate
600
years
of
our
jurisprudence.
it's
a
fiction,
but
--
because
it
does
historically
and
legally
operate,
irrespective
of
the
criminal
liability
of
the
owner,
and
because
this
court
is
consistently
sustained
the
constitutionality
of
this
type
of
forfeiture,
we
think
it
critical
that
these
statutes
do
not
focus
upon
the
criminal
liability
of
the
owner
or
the
possibility
that
he
might
be
able
to
resist
prosecution
as
in
marchetti
and
grosso
by
invoking
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
the
focus
in
this
case,
this
type
of
forfeiture
is
on
the
property's
use,
and
we
think
that
since
property
clearly
has
no
privilege
against
self-incrimination,
it's
inherently
a
personal
privilege.
we
think
the
case
follows
rather
logically
from
the
campbell
painting
case
where
the
court
said
there,
the
actual
focus
of
the
penalty
in
that
case,
again,
i
reiterate
that
we
do
not
consider
this
type
of
forfeiture
penalty
and
this
court
has
never
treated
as
such.
but
in
campbell
painting,
the
penalty
focused
on
a
corporation
which
has
no
privilege,
and
the
court
said,
the
corporation
therefore
is
in
no
position
to
complain
that
an
individual,
that
the
occasion
for
the
penalty
has
been
the
invocation
of
the
privilege
by
an
individual.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
i
think
as
a
factual
matter,
we
can
say
fairly
confidently
that
it
does
not
provide
any
great
impetus
to
an
individual
to
come
forward
and
register.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
or
to
pay
the
tax,
because
in
fact,
the
--
as
this
case
illustrates;
the
man
is
not
terribly
disadvantaged
by
the
seizure
of
this
property.
this
was
the
bankroll
used
in
conducting
an
illicit
business.
it's
just
one
of
the
risks
of
the
game.
i
think,
it
could
be
fairly
said
that
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
the
worst
that
can
happen
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
the
worst
that
can
happen
is
that
money
which
has
been
used
in
violation
of
this
act
which
may
or
may
not
belong
to
me.
in
the
dean
case
in
the
sixth
circuit,
$300,000.00
is
involved
and
the
district
court
said
even
now
we
seized
from
the
home
of
the
dean's,
it
apparently
did
not
all
belong
to
them
because
they
provided
the
banking
clearing
house
for
the
gambling
operation.
i
think
that
illustrates
that
the
lost
does
not
necessarily
fall
on
the
person
who
otherwise
would
be
compelled
to
come
forward
to
pay
the
tax
and
to
register.
it's
not
a
direct
cause
on
axis,
prompting
him
to
give
incriminatory
information.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
it's
paid
to
the
treasurer
as
part
of
internal
revenue
collections.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
the
government
--
yes,
the
money
is
covered
into
the
general
treasury.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
the
government
can
either
use
them
if
seizing
agency
so
determines
or
it
can
auction
them
off.
mr.

lacovara

mr.

that
is
very
violations
of

of

types
of
forfeitures.
there
not
all,
we
can
see
internal
revenue
forfeitures,
some
i
think
would
be
--
we
would
have
to
in
candor
concede
would
be
more
of
the
penal
kind
in
this
type
of
case.

violation
of
the
laws
regulating

free
(voice
overlap)
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes,
sir.
i
would
like
to
say
that
we
have
argued
that
in
the
event,
the
court
determines
that
marchetti
and
grosso
should
apply
to
forfeitures
of
this
type.
the
decision
should
not
be
made
retroactive
and
should
apply
only
to
seizures
made
after
the
date
of
those
decisions.
we
think
the
court's
power
to
make
new
constitutional
rules
prospective
only
now
as
well
settled,
and
that
each
of
the
three
factors
to
be
considered
counsels
prospective
application
in
this
case.
we
have
discussed
the
effect
and
the
reliance
in
our
brief.
i
would
like
to
say
that
in
terms
of
the
purpose
of
the
new
rule,
we
suggest
that
the
protection
of
the
fifth
amendment
which
would
be
the
essential
purpose
of
this
rule
would
not
be
measurably
advanced
by
applying
it
in
this
type
of
case,
applying
it
retroactively
when
by
definition,
the
individual
has
not
come
forward
to
waive
his
privilege
and
has
not
given
any
information
which
would
be
--
mr.
philip

lacovara
no,
it
would
have
a
result
in
a
reversal
because

mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
no,
we
are
the
petitioner
mr.
justice
douglas,
the
seventh
circuit
has
reversed
the
decree
of
forfeiture
and
our
proposed
judgment
of
at
least
would
say
the
forfeiture,
that
the
application
of
the
fifth
amendment
should
not
bar
seizures
which
took
place
as
in
this
case,
four
and
a
half
years
before
grosso
and
marchetti,
so
that
the
seventh
circuit's
judgment
should
be
reversed.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
no,
the
rule
that
i'm
saying
should
be
made
prospective.
if
the
court
rejects
our
basic
position
is
that
grosso
and
marchetti
can
const
--
or
the
principles
announced
therein,
can
constitute
a
substantive
defense
to
an
internal
revenue
forfeiture
proceeding.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
and
in
that
situation,
that
rule
would
not
apply
at
this
proceeding
and
the
government
would
be
entitled
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
--
$3,000.00.
i'd
like
to
save
any
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
apparently,
that's
academic.
