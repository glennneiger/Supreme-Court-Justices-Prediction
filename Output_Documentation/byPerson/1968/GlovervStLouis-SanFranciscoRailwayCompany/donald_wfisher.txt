mr.
donald
w.fisher
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
beginning
of
my
address,
i
should
like
to
point
out,
first
of
all,
that
this
is
not
a
civil
rights
act
suit
and
point
out,
as
the
court
below
pointed
out
in
the
memorandum
opinion,
that,
substantially,
the
same
plaintiffs
have
alleged
a
violation
of
their
civil
rights
under
title
7
and
that
particular
matter
is
being
processed
at
the
present
time
in
the
net
case
to
which
reference
was
made
in
the
book
article
commented
upon
by
mr.
acker.
so
that
any
possible
unfair
employment
practices
which
had
been
committed
against
these
individuals,
and
i
do
not
at
all
concede
or
intimate
that
any
were
committed,
is
in
the
process
of
litigation
in
the
lower
courts
at
the
present
time
and
has
no
real
connection
with
the
instant
case.
the
instant
case
is
a
railway
labor
act
case.
the
group
of
employees
--
mr.
donald
w.fisher
the
union
was
made
a
defendant
in
that
proceeding,
sir.
mr.
donald
w.fisher
yes,
sir.
the
group
of
petitioners
involved
is
a
racially
mixed
group,
as
mr.
acker
pointed
out.
there
are,
i
believe,
eight
negro
members
of
the
group
and
six
white
members
of
the
group.
so,
it
is
not,
on
the
surface,
a
normal
type
of
racial
discrimination
case
where
all
of
the
members
are
members
of
a
minority
racial
or
religious
group.
the
brotherhood
and
the
carrier,
and
i
am
speaking
in
this
instance
for
both
of
us,
holds
no
brief
for
racial
discrimination
in
any
form.
the
brotherhood
and
the
carrier
concedes
that
no
contract
or
arrangement
which
makes
invidious
discriminations
or
hostile
discriminations
based
on
race,
color,
creed,
and
national
origin
could
be
or
should
be
countenanced,
and
that
is
not
the
issue
in
the
case
in
its
present
posture.
the
question
involved
is
whether
the
plaintiffs
pleaded
a
sufficient
attempt
to
exhaust
the
administrative
contractual
remedies
to
allow
them
to
remain
in
court.
the
case
has
an
interesting
parallel
to
the
court's
decision
in
vaca
versus
sipes.
in
vaca
versus
sipes,
the
union
alone,
as
the
court
would
recall,
was
named
in
the
lawsuit.
but,
in
the
court's
opinion,
the
court
indicated
that
perhaps
the
employer
should
have
been
joined
in
that
particular
action
because,
in
fact,
both
the
employer
and
the
union
had
interest
and
could
be
adversely
affected
by
the
nature
of
the
complaint.
now,
in
vaca
versus
sipes,
which
was
not
a
case
arising
under
the
railway
labor
act,
the
claim
against
the
employer
for
wrong
--
for
breach
of
the
collective
bargaining
contract,
for
wrongful
discharge,
if
you
will,
was
a
legally
cognizable
claim.
it
was
a
justiciable
claim,
and
the
claim
against
the
union
for
breach
of
the
duty
of
fair
representation
was
a
legally
cognizable
claim.
so,
this
court,
i
believe,
quite
properly
held
that
the
two
could,
and
perhaps
in
future
suits
subsequent
to
vaca,
should
be
joined
together
in
one
action.
but,
in
the
present
case,
the
claim
of
the
employee
against
the
carrier
for
violation
of
his
employment
rights
as
embodied
in
a
collective
bargaining
agreement,
and
perhaps
in
customs
and
practices,
has
been
uniformly
held
by
this
court
for
a
number
of
years
to
be
non-justiciable.
this
claim,
under
no
stretch
of
the
imagination,
can
be
combined
with
a
claim
against
the
union
for
alleged
breach
of
the
duty
of
fair
representation
because,
as
mr.
justice
white
indicated
in
some
of
his
questions,
the
matter
must
be
submitted
before
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board.
mr.
donald
w.fisher
yes,
sir?
mr.
donald
w.fisher
yes,
sir.
the
--
however
--
mr.
donald
w.fisher
not
at
the
level,
mr.
justice,
as
which
the
selections
to
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board
made.
the--
mr.
donald
w.fisher
yes,
the
allegation
is
made
--
mr.
donald
w.fisher
yes,
sir.
mr.
donald
w.fisher
i
would
not
believe
it
would
be,
sir.
mr.
donald
w.fisher
the
two
of
us?
mr.
donald
w.fisher
that
is
not
as
clear
as
the
first
answer.
i
think
there
would
be
some
questions
of
constitutionality.
mr.
donald
w.fisher
the
difference
between
that
and
this
situation
is
that,
at
the
highest
level,
that
carrier
group
and
the
union
groups
appoint
individuals
who
are
designated
by
federal
statute
to
act
as
arbitrators.
this
court
has
said
that
the
national
railroad
adjustment
procedure,
it
said
this
many
times,
is
compulsory
arbitration.
and,
i
believe
it
would
be,
indeed,
presumptuous
to
assume
that
the
arbitrators
who
are
appointed,
it's
true
they
are
appointed
by
a
carrier
group,
a
high
level
carrier
group
and
a
high
level
union
group,
would
not
charge
their
duties
under
law
the
same
as
all
citizens.
it
should
be
presumed
at
least,
perhaps
i'm
getting
mixed
in
my
syntax,
i
think
the
presumptions
would
certainly
be
that
these
members,
the
carrier
members
and
the
labor
members,
abide
by
the
law
do
not
countenance
hostile
or
invidious
racial
discrimination
and
bring
forth
a
correct
construction
and
application
of
railroad
collective
bargaining
agreements.
and,
i
think,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
has
been
recognized
by
this
court
that
miscarriages
of
justice
will
probably
result
if
judges
who
are
not
experts
in
railroad
matters
and
are
not
familiar
with
the
railroad
parlance
should
attempt
to
interpret
these
agreements
in
the
customs
and
practices
that
also
are,
at
times,
are
embodied
in
the
agreement.
mr.
donald
w.fisher
well,
steel
--
mr.
donald
w.fisher
steel,
no,
sir.
but,
the
steel
case
was
not
a
case
involving
a
claim
for
an
interpretation
of
rights
under
an
agreement.
in
fact,
the
steel
case
posited
a
completely
discriminatory
and
illegal
agreement
that
needed
no
construction.
it
was,
on
its
face,
discriminatory
against
the
negro
firemen
who
were
classified
as
non-promotable.
therefore,
there
was
no
question
for
the
adjustment
board,
no
question
of
interpretation.
the
contract
was
simply
non-maintainable
and
the
suit
--
mr.
donald
w.fisher
no.
mr.
donald
w.fisher
no,
sir,
mr.
justice
white.
what
i
am
saying
is
this.
mr.
donald
w.fisher
the
court
in
the
steel
case,
i
believe,
said
that
this
was
not
a
matter
that
was
to
be
heard
before
the
adjustment
board
because
the
hostile
discrimination
against
these
individuals
engaged
in
by
the
union
could
not
be
remedied
before
the
adjustment
board,
and
that
was
the
suit
which
established,
as
i
understand
it,
the
so-called
civil
action
for
a
breach
of
the
duty
of
fair
representation.
now,
i
concede,
on
behalf
of
the
brotherhood,
that
the
brotherhood
is
amenable
to
suit
not
under
the
terms
of
this
collective
bargaining
contract
which
is
to
be
construed
exclusively
by
the
adjustment
board,
but
is
amenable
to
suit
on
the
theory
that
it
failed
to
accord
the
plaintiffs
their
right
of
fair
representation.
and,
i
think
this
case
raises
the
question
whether
a
plaintiff,
who
is
a
railroad
employee
and
is
represented
by
the
brotherhood
and
is
also
a
member
of
the
brotherhood.
we
must
remember,
in
the
steel
case,
the
negro
firemen
were
not
members
of
the
brotherhood
nor
were
they
eligible
to
be
members
of
the
brotherhood.
in
this
case,
the
plaintiffs
are
and
are
conceded
to
be,
in
the
pleadings,
members
of
the
brotherhood.
and,
i
think
the
question
arises
here
whether
they
do
not
have
the
same
duty
as
other
members
of
the
brotherhood
to
attempt
to
invoke
the
procedures
under
the
union
constitution
to,
in
other
words,
require
the
brotherhood
to
accord
them
their
due
rights
of
representation.
i
think
this
is
very
similar
to
the
problem
that
was
posited
in
conley
versus
gibson,
except
that,
in
conley
versus
gibson,
the
question
whether
those
particular
members
of--
those
particular
employees
who
were
in
the
clerk
crafter
class
had
any
union
remedies
to
exhaust.
and,
i
think,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
on
the
facts
such
as
they
are
related
to
the
conley
versus
gibson
decision
that
those
clerks
were
not
members
of
the
brotherhood.
but,
in
any
event,
the
question
of
their
need
to
exhaust
the
remedies
under
the
union
constitution
was
not
discussed
and
not
decided.
i
think
that
is
the
question
for
the
court
to
decide
here.
mr.
donald
w.fisher
no,
what
i
say,
mr.
justice,
about
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board
is
simply
this,
that
for
a
vindication
of
their
rights
of
seniority,
their
contract
rights,
as
railroad
employees,
their
rights
under
the
contract
and
customs
and
practices,
that
that
is
a
matter
solely
and
exclusively
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board
and
that
this
has
been
held
many,
many
times
and
that
there
are
no
exceptions
to
that
rule,
except
in
the
one
instance
when
an
employee
accepts
a
discharge
as
final,
the
moore
versus
illinois
central
exception,
and
then
attempts
to
sue
the
carrier
for
damages
only.
mr.
donald
w.fisher
pardon?
mr.
donald
w.fisher
i
do
not
believe
that
that
means
--
mr.
donald
w.fisher
i
must
say
that
i
am
unable
to
give
a
description
of
the
hayes
case.
i
have
prepared
on
many,
many
cases
but
i
cannot
at
this
time--
mr.
donald
w.fisher
state
exactly
what
hayes
held.
mr.
donald
w.fisher
i
--
mr.
donald
w.fisher
yes.
mr.
donald
w.fisher
yes.
as
i
interpret
that,
it
means
that
the
union
is
amenable
to
suit,
as
was
the
case
in
conley
versus
gibson,
to
require
the
union
to
act
on
behalf
of
the
employee
because,
in
conley
versus
gibson,
this
court
--
in
conley
versus
gibson,
the
particular
breach
of
the
duty
of
fair
representation
was
alleged
to
be
that
the
brotherhood
would
process
grievances
that
were
submitted
by
white
members
of
the
craft
but
refused,
simply
because
of
race,
to
process
similar
grievances
on
behalf
of
negro
members
of
the
craft,
and
the
court's
decision
in
conley
stated
that
this,
if
proven
at
trial,
would
be
a
breach
of
the
duty
of
fair
representation
and
that
relief
would
lie
against
the
brotherhood
to
require
the
brotherhood
to
process
the
grievances.
and,
i
think
that
if
there
was
any
contrary
intimation
in
the
hayes
case
that
that
was
wrong,
that
should
have
been
overruled.
but,
again,
as
i
understand
--
mr.
donald
w.fisher
well,
if
the
agreement
--
mr.
donald
w.fisher
only--
not
as
to
the
agreement.
mr.
donald
w.fisher
well,
mr.
justice
brennan,
again,
i
am
sorry
that
i
can't
discuss
the
hayes
case
in
the
detail
that
i
should
be
--
mr.
donald
w.fisher
in
the
present
--
mr.
donald
w.fisher
yes.
mr.
donald
w.fisher
yes,
i
think
conley
was
limited
to
a
claim
that
the
union
failed
to
accord
these
negro
members
of
the
clerk
craft,
on
that
carrier,
their
rights
of
fair
representation.
and,
the
court
found
that,
on
the
basis
of
the
allegations
made,
this
would
be
true.
mr.
donald
w.fisher
well,
i
--
mr.
donald
w.fisher
i
would
think
it
may
well
had
been
if
the
contract
was
clearly
discriminatory.
mr.
donald
w.fisher
yes,
but
conley
versus
gibson
has
indicated
that
the
breach
of
the
duty
that
we're
talking
about,
i
think,
in
part
of
this
case,
a
fair
representation
is
a
breach
of
duty
on
the
part
of
the
union,
a
breach
of
contract
when
you
say
interpretation
of
contracts.
if
a
carrier
refuses
to
accord
a
group
of
its
employees
certain
promotional
rights,
that's
a
breach
of
contract.
mr.
donald
w.fisher
i
am
not
aware
that
the
supreme
court
in
those
cases
held
that
the
board
was
not
a
fair
tribunal
or
a
proper
tribunal
to
bring
a
contract
claim.
i
will
state
to
the
court
that
it
is
clear
that
if
the
contract
is
illegal
and
there
is
no
real
debate
or
there's
no
doubt
that
the
contract
is
an
illegal
and
discriminatory
contract,
then
there
is,
in
fact,
nothing
for
the
adjustment
board
to
interpret
or
to
construe.
mr.
donald
w.fisher
i
have
seen
the
case,
but
i
--
that's
--
mr.
donald
w.fisher
no,
but
i
--
again,
the
only
explanation
i
can
give
is
that
the
conley
versus
gibson
case
dealt
with
the
duty
of
the
railroad
to
press
the
grievance
when
they
were
asked
to
press
the
grievance.
when
the
grievance
was
filed,
the
brotherhood
refused
to
press
it,
and
they
did
it
because
of
race.
and,
this
court
held
that
that
was
a
duty
--
a
violation
of
the
duty
of
fair
representation.
we
don't
dispute
that.
we
say
the
question
that
is
raised
here
is,
even
though
there
may
arguably
be
an
allegation
that
the
brotherhood
refused
to
act
on
behalf
of
these
plaintiffs
in
a
proper
manner.
since
they
were
members
of
the
union,
whether
they
didn't
have
the
duty,
which
by
analogy
we
can
find
in
section
101
(a)
(4)
or
4
(11)
(a)
(4)
of
the
landrum-griffin
act,
the
duty
to
attempt
to
get
relief
within
the
union's
tribunals
before
running
into
court
to
sue
the
union.
we
say,
by
the
same
token,
when
the
contract
is
admitted
to
be
a
proper
contract,
the
contract
is
not
discriminatory.
the
contract
is
not
being
attacked.
what
is
being
attacked
is
that
the
railroad
is
breaching
the
contract
and
that
the
union
is
alluding
with
the
railroad
in
this
breach
of
the
agreement.
that,
however,
it
is
not
at
all
clear
that
this
contract
gives
them
the
right
as
helpers
to
be
promoted
to
carmen
as
against
the
claim
of
apprentices
to
be
promoted
to
carmen,
and
this
is
a
matter
which
involves
the
expertise
of
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board
and
it's--
mr.
donald
w.fisher
that
is
the
issue
which
i
think
is
justiciable
in
the
courts,
mr.
justice.
we
concede
that
that
is
a
legally
jsuticiable
claim,
whether
he
is
being
discriminated
against
on
account
of
his
race,
not
the
contract
rights
that
he
has
under
the
agreement,
that
is
an
adjustment
board
matter,
but
whether
he
is
being
discriminated
against.
now,
to
the
extent
that
he's
suing
the
union
for
discriminating
against
him
and
is
a
member
of
the
union,
he
should
attempt
to
exhaust
his
union
remedies.
that
is
our
position.
he
made
no
attempt
and
it
is
clear
from
the
pleading
that
both
in
the
original
pleading
and
the
amending
com
--
pleading
--
mr.
donald
w.fisher
pardon
me?
mr.
donald
w.fisher
not
damages.
adjustment
board
grants
backpay
and,
however,
this
might
be
--
mr.
donald
w.fisher
justice
marshall
--
mr.
donald
w.fisher
there
is
no
jump
from
the
union
to
the
adjustment
board.
the
claim
against
the
union
is
not
a
claim
destined
for
resolution
by
the
adjustment
board.
mr.
donald
w.fisher
that
is
our
po
--
we
concede
that.
mr.
donald
w.fisher
well,
but
we
say,
yes,
but
we
say
also,
before
--
as
a
member
of
an
association,
before
they
attempt
to
sue
the
association
for
a
possible
act
of
misp
--
on
the
part
of
a
local
agent,
that
it
is
neat
and
proper,
and
is
so
recognized
under
federal
law
as
neat
and
proper,
to
attempt
to
get
this
matter
resolved
internally
and
within
the
organization.
and,
if
they
had
done
this
at
the
first
time
they
were
aware
of
any
discrimination,
it
is
entirely
possible
that
they
would
--
the
discrimination
would
have
been
eliminated,
but
they
never
filed
any
grievance,
any
claim
within
the
confines
of
the
brotherhood
to
the
effect
that
officials
at
birmingham
were
discriminating
against
them.
now,
we
say
that
that
type
of
exhaustion
of
remedy
under
the
union
constitution
is
necessary
under
law
and
it
is
necessary
in
fairness
to
the
union
because
the
union
can
be
held
liable
for
the
action
of
his
agents,
but
it
should
have
some
opportunity
to
take
corrective
action.
mr.
donald
w.fisher
i
--
yes,
if
they
had
attempted,
if
they
had
made
a
fair
bonafied
reasonable
attempt,
which
they
did
not
make
and
which
they
concede
they
didn't
make,
and
had
found
that
they
were
getting
no
relief.
i
think
that,
pursuant
to
the
law,
as
it
existed,
they
might
have
then
turned
to
the
courts
and
sought
relief,
but
they
made
no
attempt
--
mr.
donald
w.fisher
well,
the
remedy
i'm
talking
about
is
the
remedy
against
the
union,
the
remedy
that
they
sought
in
conley
versus
gibson.
mr.
donald
w.fisher
well,
conceivably,
in
the
claim
against
the
union.
mr.
donald
w.fisher
not
in
respect
to
their
claim
for
an
interpretation
or
application
of
the
language
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
that
is
a
matter
to
--
the
question
of
whether
they
were
actually
entitled
to
be
upgraded
to
carmen
or
whether
apprentices
were
improperly
upgraded
instead
of
them
is
a
question
that,
under
all
the
decisions
of
this
court,
it
seems
to
me,
must
be
resolved
by
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board.
mr.
donald
w.fisher
yes,
the
relief
under
the
contract
is
available
before
the
adjustment
board.
the
relief
against
the
union
and
the
relief
for
breach
of
the
duty,
the
relief
for
racial
discrimination,
for
breach
of
the
duty
fair
representation
is
a
claim
which
is
judicially
cognizable
for
which
recovery
may
be
made
after
proper
proof,
but
our
position
here
again
is
that
there
is
this
duty,
this
preliminary
duty,
which
is
i
think
well-embodied
in
federal
law
to
attempt
to
exhaust
the
remedies
available
to
them.
and,
they
concede,
i
do
want
to
emphasize
to
the
court,
that
they
had
in
no
point
ever
denied
that
there
are
remedies.they
refused
in
their
pleadings
to
spell
--
to
state
what
the
contract
remedies
are
and
what
the
union
constitutional
remedies
are,
but
they
have
taken
a
rather
cavalier
attitude
toward
these
remedies
and
said
"there's
no
need
for
us
to
attempt
to
exhaust
them."
we
feel
that
we're,
because
this
is
a
racial
case,
i
presume,
we're
immune
from
that
requirement
that
all
other
persons,
presumably,
are
imposed
with.
and,
that
is
the
--
mr.
donald
w.fisher
not
very
long,
and
--
mr.
donald
w.fisher
i
would
say
the
grievance
procedure
on
the
property,
if
you're
talking
about
the
railroad
property
--
mr.
donald
w.fisher
well,
the
grievance
is
two-fold.
they
had
a
grievance
against
the
union
--
mr.
donald
w.fisher
both
of
--
mr.
donald
w.fisher
alright,
both
of
them
together,
i
believe
that
they
could
have
processed
the
grievances
fully
in
less
than
two
years.
mr.
donald
w.fisher
less
than
two
years,
yes,
sir.
mr.
donald
w.fisher
no,
i
was
assuming
that
the
arbitration
board
decision
would
also
be
handed
down,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
that
the
entire
matter
could've
been
processed
on
the
property
to
the
adjustment
board
and
also
the
claim
within
the
union's
tribunals
to
make
the
union
do
what
they
say
the
union
wouldn't
do
in
less
than
two
years.
mr.
donald
w.fisher
no,
i
said
less
than
three
years,
but
my
co-counsel
of
the
carrier
pointed
out
a
report
which
i
then
read
and
the
case
--
the
backlog
is
less
than
a
year
on
the
second
division,
and
i
am
of
the
opinion
--
mr.
donald
w.fisher
i
said
less
than
three
years.
i
now
say
two
years
or
less.
two
years
or
less,
the
entire
matter
could've
been
processed
through
all
of
the
conceivable
tribunals
involved.
mr.
donald
w.fisher
through
the
courts,
mr.
justice
black?
mr.
donald
w.fisher
well
--
mr.
donald
w.fisher
well,
now,
a
decision
of
the
board,
of
course,
is
final
and
binding,
except
for
certain
limited
grounds
of
review.
so
that,
unless
those
grounds
were
available,
there
would
be
no
court
review.
mr.
donald
w.fisher
if
they
were
available,
i
would
hesitate
to
say
what
the
state
had
adopted
in
birmingham,
alabama,
as
in
the
courts.
it
would
be
longer.
thank
you.
mr.
donald
w.fisher
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
to
go
back
to
the
point
which
i
left
at
the
noon
recess,
in
talking
about
the
tungsten
case
and
the
steel
case,
it
seems
to
me,
that
the
carrier
and
the
brotherhood
again
say
that,
regardless
of
who
the
parties
were
in
those
cases,
the
cases
involved
the
question
of
the
duty
of
a
labor
union
to
accord
to
minority
members
of
a
craft
or
class
fair
representation.
and,
i
think
that's
put
in
sharp
outline
by
the
opening
statement
of
chief
justice
stone
who
said
the
question
is
whether
the
railway
labor
act
imposes
on
a
labor
organization,
acting
by
authority
of
the
statute
as
exclusive
bargaining
representative
of
a
craft
or
class
or
railway
employees,
the
duty
to
represent
all
the
employees
in
the
craft
without
discrimination
because
of
their
race
and,
if
so,
whether
the
courts
have
jurisdiction
to
protect
the
minority
of
the
craft
or
class
from
the
violation
of
such
obligation
and
point
out
further,
again,
regardless
of
who
the
parties
were,
that
was
the
issue,
that
the
court
also
noted
that
there
were
no
differences
between
the
parties
in
the
steel
case,
or
in
the
tungsten
case
for
that
matter,
as
to
the
interpretation
of
the
contract
at
page
205
of
the
court's
opinion
there's
--
nor
are
there
any
differences
as
to
the
interpretation
of
the
contract
which,
by
the
act,
are
committed
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
railroad
adjustment
board.
now,
in
the
tungsten
case,
it's
true
that
it
was
a
discriminatory
application
but,
again,
it
was
filled
in
that
case
that
the
union
was
the
party,
the
guilty
party,
the
most
guilty
party
that
violated
this
duty
of
fair
representation.
now,
again,
in
conley
versus
gibson,
the
thrust
was
against
the
union
for
refusing
to
process
these
grievances,
and
we
concede
in
this
case
that
the
union
cannot
discriminate.
there
is
no
problem,
in
my
mind,
about
that.
this
union
cannot
discriminate.
i
see
my
time
is
up.
mr.
donald
w.fisher
yes,
sir.
i
merely
want
to
say
that
this
case
presents
the
question
when
you're
suing
the
union
for
violation
of
that
duty
and
the
plaintiff
is
a
member.
even
though
he's
a
negro,
he's
a
member
of
the
union.doesn't
he
have
the
same
obligation
that
other
union
members
have
of
attempting
to
utilize
his
internal
remedies.
and,
the
question
of
the
interpretation
and
application
of
the
agreement,
which
mr.
acker
concede
is
at
the
root
of
this
case,
is
a
question
of
the
interpretation
of
the
contract.
there's
no
conceded
--
mr.
donald
w.fisher
well
--
mr.
donald
w.fisher
i
think
that's
--
they
had
a
however.
i
think,
yes,
sir.
i
re-read
it
and
they
did
make
that
observation,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
donald
w.fisher
well,
may
i
answer
the
question
this
way,
mr.
justice
white.
the
court
observed
in
those
days
that
the
adjustment
board
wouldn't
permit
individual
claimants
to
go
before
it.
it
said,
in
over
400
cases,
not
--
mr.
donald
w.fisher
yes,
alright.
mr.
donald
w.fisher
yes,
sir.
let
me
attempt
to
answer
it
directly
then,
if
i
may,
if
haven't
been
direct.
in
that
case,
they
were
talking
about
the
breach
of
the
union
of
its
duty
of
fair
representation
and
they
said
this
is
not
the
claim
that
you
go
to
the
adjustment
board,
and
i
will
concede
they
said
perhaps
it
wouldn't
be
a
fair
tribunal
in
weighing
the
union's
duty
because
it
was
a
union
appointed
representative
and
tribunal.
i
am
saying,
and
i
hope
that
i've
been
clear
in
this,
that
the
question
of
contract
interpretation,
pure
and
simple,
is
the
only
question
that
i
believe
is
properbly
--
properly
referable
to
the
adjustment
board.
and,
i
am
conceding
with
justice
marshall
and
with
other
justices
in
the
court
that
the
claim
for
breach
of
the
duty
to
treat
members
of
the
craft
or
class
fairly
is
a
claim
that
is
cognizable
in
the
court
and
i
say
on
that
claim,
which
is
a
judicially
cognizable
claim,
since
he's
a
member
of
the
union
suing
his
union,
he
should
first
make
some
attempts
to
exhaust
the
remedies.
if
he
had
done
that,
years
ago,
he
may
have
had
immediate
instantaneous
relief,
but
he
made
no
attempt
and
he
admits
that
he
made
no
attempt
to
exhaust
these
remedies.
mr.
donald
w.fisher
thank
you.
mr.
donald
w.fisher
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
beginning
of
my
address,
i
should
like
to
point
out,
first
of
all,
that
this
is
not
a
civil
rights
act
suit
and
point
out,
as
the
court
below
pointed
out
in
the
memorandum
opinion,
that,
substantially,
the
same
plaintiffs
have
alleged
a
violation
of
their
civil
rights
under
title
7
and
that
particular
matter
is
being
processed
at
the
present
time
in
the
net
case
to
which
reference
was
made
in
the
book
article
commented
upon
by
mr.
acker.
so
that
any
possible
unfair
employment
practices
which
had
been
committed
against
these
individuals,
and
i
do
not
at
all
concede
or
intimate
that
any
were
committed,
is
in
the
process
of
litigation
in
the
lower
courts
at
the
present
time
and
has
no
real
connection
with
the
instant
case.
the
instant
case
is
a
railway
labor
act
case.
the
group
of
employees
--
mr.
donald
w.fisher
the
union
was
made
a
defendant
in
that
proceeding,
sir.
mr.
donald
w.fisher
yes,
sir.
the
group
of
petitioners
involved
is
a
racially
mixed
group,
as
mr.
acker
pointed
out.
there
are,
i
believe,
eight
negro
members
of
the
group
and
six
white
members
of
the
group.
so,
it
is
not,
on
the
surface,
a
normal
type
of
racial
discrimination
case
where
all
of
the
members
are
members
of
a
minority
racial
or
religious
group.
the
brotherhood
and
the
carrier,
and
i
am
speaking
in
this
instance
for
both
of
us,
holds
no
brief
for
racial
discrimination
in
any
form.
the
brotherhood
and
the
carrier
concedes
that
no
contract
or
arrangement
which
makes
invidious
discriminations
or
hostile
discriminations
based
on
race,
color,
creed,
and
national
origin
could
be
or
should
be
countenanced,
and
that
is
not
the
issue
in
the
case
in
its
present
posture.
the
question
involved
is
whether
the
plaintiffs
pleaded
a
sufficient
attempt
to
exhaust
the
administrative
contractual
remedies
to
allow
them
to
remain
in
court.
the
case
has
an
interesting
parallel
to
the
court's
decision
in
vaca
versus
sipes.
in
vaca
versus
sipes,
the
union
alone,
as
the
court
would
recall,
was
named
in
the
lawsuit.
but,
in
the
court's
opinion,
the
court
indicated
that
perhaps
the
employer
should
have
been
joined
in
that
particular
action
because,
in
fact,
both
the
employer
and
the
union
had
interest
and
could
be
adversely
affected
by
the
nature
of
the
complaint.
now,
in
vaca
versus
sipes,
which
was
not
a
case
arising
under
the
railway
labor
act,
the
claim
against
the
employer
for
wrong
--
for
breach
of
the
collective
bargaining
contract,
for
wrongful
discharge,
if
you
will,
was
a
legally
cognizable
claim.
it
was
a
justiciable
claim,
and
the
claim
against
the
union
for
breach
of
the
duty
of
fair
representation
was
a
legally
cognizable
claim.
so,
this
court,
i
believe,
quite
properly
held
that
the
two
could,
and
perhaps
in
future
suits
subsequent
to
vaca,
should
be
joined
together
in
one
action.
but,
in
the
present
case,
the
claim
of
the
employee
against
the
carrier
for
violation
of
his
employment
rights
as
embodied
in
a
collective
bargaining
agreement,
and
perhaps
in
customs
and
practices,
has
been
uniformly
held
by
this
court
for
a
number
of
years
to
be
non-justiciable.
this
claim,
under
no
stretch
of
the
imagination,
can
be
combined
with
a
claim
against
the
union
for
alleged
breach
of
the
duty
of
fair
representation
because,
as
mr.
justice
white
indicated
in
some
of
his
questions,
the
matter
must
be
submitted
before
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board.
mr.
donald
w.fisher
yes,
sir?
mr.
donald
w.fisher
yes,
sir.
the
--
however
--
mr.
donald
w.fisher
not
at
the
level,
mr.
justice,
as
which
the
selections
to
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board
made.
the--
mr.
donald
w.fisher
yes,
the
allegation
is
made
--
mr.
donald
w.fisher
yes,
sir.
mr.
donald
w.fisher
i
would
not
believe
it
would
be,
sir.
mr.
donald
w.fisher
the
two
of
us?
mr.
donald
w.fisher
that
is
not
as
clear
as
the
first
answer.
i
think
there
would
be
some
questions
of
constitutionality.
mr.
donald
w.fisher
the
difference
between
that
and
this
situation
is
that,
at
the
highest
level,
that
carrier
group
and
the
union
groups
appoint
individuals
who
are
designated
by
federal
statute
to
act
as
arbitrators.
this
court
has
said
that
the
national
railroad
adjustment
procedure,
it
said
this
many
times,
is
compulsory
arbitration.
and,
i
believe
it
would
be,
indeed,
presumptuous
to
assume
that
the
arbitrators
who
are
appointed,
it's
true
they
are
appointed
by
a
carrier
group,
a
high
level
carrier
group
and
a
high
level
union
group,
would
not
charge
their
duties
under
law
the
same
as
all
citizens.
it
should
be
presumed
at
least,
perhaps
i'm
getting
mixed
in
my
syntax,
i
think
the
presumptions
would
certainly
be
that
these
members,
the
carrier
members
and
the
labor
members,
abide
by
the
law
do
not
countenance
hostile
or
invidious
racial
discrimination
and
bring
forth
a
correct
construction
and
application
of
railroad
collective
bargaining
agreements.
and,
i
think,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
has
been
recognized
by
this
court
that
miscarriages
of
justice
will
probably
result
if
judges
who
are
not
experts
in
railroad
matters
and
are
not
familiar
with
the
railroad
parlance
should
attempt
to
interpret
these
agreements
in
the
customs
and
practices
that
also
are,
at
times,
are
embodied
in
the
agreement.
mr.
donald
w.fisher
well,
steel
--
mr.
donald
w.fisher
steel,
no,
sir.
but,
the
steel
case
was
not
a
case
involving
a
claim
for
an
interpretation
of
rights
under
an
agreement.
in
fact,
the
steel
case
posited
a
completely
discriminatory
and
illegal
agreement
that
needed
no
construction.
it
was,
on
its
face,
discriminatory
against
the
negro
firemen
who
were
classified
as
non-promotable.
therefore,
there
was
no
question
for
the
adjustment
board,
no
question
of
interpretation.
the
contract
was
simply
non-maintainable
and
the
suit
--
mr.
donald
w.fisher
no.
mr.
donald
w.fisher
no,
sir,
mr.
justice
white.
what
i
am
saying
is
this.
mr.
donald
w.fisher
the
court
in
the
steel
case,
i
believe,
said
that
this
was
not
a
matter
that
was
to
be
heard
before
the
adjustment
board
because
the
hostile
discrimination
against
these
individuals
engaged
in
by
the
union
could
not
be
remedied
before
the
adjustment
board,
and
that
was
the
suit
which
established,
as
i
understand
it,
the
so-called
civil
action
for
a
breach
of
the
duty
of
fair
representation.
now,
i
concede,
on
behalf
of
the
brotherhood,
that
the
brotherhood
is
amenable
to
suit
not
under
the
terms
of
this
collective
bargaining
contract
which
is
to
be
construed
exclusively
by
the
adjustment
board,
but
is
amenable
to
suit
on
the
theory
that
it
failed
to
accord
the
plaintiffs
their
right
of
fair
representation.
and,
i
think
this
case
raises
the
question
whether
a
plaintiff,
who
is
a
railroad
employee
and
is
represented
by
the
brotherhood
and
is
also
a
member
of
the
brotherhood.
we
must
remember,
in
the
steel
case,
the
negro
firemen
were
not
members
of
the
brotherhood
nor
were
they
eligible
to
be
members
of
the
brotherhood.
in
this
case,
the
plaintiffs
are
and
are
conceded
to
be,
in
the
pleadings,
members
of
the
brotherhood.
and,
i
think
the
question
arises
here
whether
they
do
not
have
the
same
duty
as
other
members
of
the
brotherhood
to
attempt
to
invoke
the
procedures
under
the
union
constitution
to,
in
other
words,
require
the
brotherhood
to
accord
them
their
due
rights
of
representation.
i
think
this
is
very
similar
to
the
problem
that
was
posited
in
conley
versus
gibson,
except
that,
in
conley
versus
gibson,
the
question
whether
those
particular
members
of--
those
particular
employees
who
were
in
the
clerk
crafter
class
had
any
union
remedies
to
exhaust.
and,
i
think,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
on
the
facts
such
as
they
are
related
to
the
conley
versus
gibson
decision
that
those
clerks
were
not
members
of
the
brotherhood.
but,
in
any
event,
the
question
of
their
need
to
exhaust
the
remedies
under
the
union
constitution
was
not
discussed
and
not
decided.
i
think
that
is
the
question
for
the
court
to
decide
here.
mr.
donald
w.fisher
no,
what
i
say,
mr.
justice,
about
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board
is
simply
this,
that
for
a
vindication
of
their
rights
of
seniority,
their
contract
rights,
as
railroad
employees,
their
rights
under
the
contract
and
customs
and
practices,
that
that
is
a
matter
solely
and
exclusively
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board
and
that
this
has
been
held
many,
many
times
and
that
there
are
no
exceptions
to
that
rule,
except
in
the
one
instance
when
an
employee
accepts
a
discharge
as
final,
the
moore
versus
illinois
central
exception,
and
then
attempts
to
sue
the
carrier
for
damages
only.
mr.
donald
w.fisher
pardon?
mr.
donald
w.fisher
i
do
not
believe
that
that
means
--
mr.
donald
w.fisher
i
must
say
that
i
am
unable
to
give
a
description
of
the
hayes
case.
i
have
prepared
on
many,
many
cases
but
i
cannot
at
this
time--
mr.
donald
w.fisher
state
exactly
what
hayes
held.
mr.
donald
w.fisher
i
--
mr.
donald
w.fisher
yes.
mr.
donald
w.fisher
yes.
as
i
interpret
that,
it
means
that
the
union
is
amenable
to
suit,
as
was
the
case
in
conley
versus
gibson,
to
require
the
union
to
act
on
behalf
of
the
employee
because,
in
conley
versus
gibson,
this
court
--
in
conley
versus
gibson,
the
particular
breach
of
the
duty
of
fair
representation
was
alleged
to
be
that
the
brotherhood
would
process
grievances
that
were
submitted
by
white
members
of
the
craft
but
refused,
simply
because
of
race,
to
process
similar
grievances
on
behalf
of
negro
members
of
the
craft,
and
the
court's
decision
in
conley
stated
that
this,
if
proven
at
trial,
would
be
a
breach
of
the
duty
of
fair
representation
and
that
relief
would
lie
against
the
brotherhood
to
require
the
brotherhood
to
process
the
grievances.
and,
i
think
that
if
there
was
any
contrary
intimation
in
the
hayes
case
that
that
was
wrong,
that
should
have
been
overruled.
but,
again,
as
i
understand
--
mr.
donald
w.fisher
well,
if
the
agreement
--
mr.
donald
w.fisher
only--
not
as
to
the
agreement.
mr.
donald
w.fisher
well,
mr.
justice
brennan,
again,
i
am
sorry
that
i
can't
discuss
the
hayes
case
in
the
detail
that
i
should
be
--
mr.
donald
w.fisher
in
the
present
--
mr.
donald
w.fisher
yes.
mr.
donald
w.fisher
yes,
i
think
conley
was
limited
to
a
claim
that
the
union
failed
to
accord
these
negro
members
of
the
clerk
craft,
on
that
carrier,
their
rights
of
fair
representation.
and,
the
court
found
that,
on
the
basis
of
the
allegations
made,
this
would
be
true.
mr.
donald
w.fisher
well,
i
--
mr.
donald
w.fisher
i
would
think
it
may
well
had
been
if
the
contract
was
clearly
discriminatory.
mr.
donald
w.fisher
yes,
but
conley
versus
gibson
has
indicated
that
the
breach
of
the
duty
that
we're
talking
about,
i
think,
in
part
of
this
case,
a
fair
representation
is
a
breach
of
duty
on
the
part
of
the
union,
a
breach
of
contract
when
you
say
interpretation
of
contracts.
if
a
carrier
refuses
to
accord
a
group
of
its
employees
certain
promotional
rights,
that's
a
breach
of
contract.
mr.
donald
w.fisher
i
am
not
aware
that
the
supreme
court
in
those
cases
held
that
the
board
was
not
a
fair
tribunal
or
a
proper
tribunal
to
bring
a
contract
claim.
i
will
state
to
the
court
that
it
is
clear
that
if
the
contract
is
illegal
and
there
is
no
real
debate
or
there's
no
doubt
that
the
contract
is
an
illegal
and
discriminatory
contract,
then
there
is,
in
fact,
nothing
for
the
adjustment
board
to
interpret
or
to
construe.
mr.
donald
w.fisher
i
have
seen
the
case,
but
i
--
that's
--
mr.
donald
w.fisher
no,
but
i
--
again,
the
only
explanation
i
can
give
is
that
the
conley
versus
gibson
case
dealt
with
the
duty
of
the
railroad
to
press
the
grievance
when
they
were
asked
to
press
the
grievance.
when
the
grievance
was
filed,
the
brotherhood
refused
to
press
it,
and
they
did
it
because
of
race.
and,
this
court
held
that
that
was
a
duty
--
a
violation
of
the
duty
of
fair
representation.
we
don't
dispute
that.
we
say
the
question
that
is
raised
here
is,
even
though
there
may
arguably
be
an
allegation
that
the
brotherhood
refused
to
act
on
behalf
of
these
plaintiffs
in
a
proper
manner.
since
they
were
members
of
the
union,
whether
they
didn't
have
the
duty,
which
by
analogy
we
can
find
in
section
101
(a)
(4)
or
4
(11)
(a)
(4)
of
the
landrum-griffin
act,
the
duty
to
attempt
to
get
relief
within
the
union's
tribunals
before
running
into
court
to
sue
the
union.
we
say,
by
the
same
token,
when
the
contract
is
admitted
to
be
a
proper
contract,
the
contract
is
not
discriminatory.
the
contract
is
not
being
attacked.
what
is
being
attacked
is
that
the
railroad
is
breaching
the
contract
and
that
the
union
is
alluding
with
the
railroad
in
this
breach
of
the
agreement.
that,
however,
it
is
not
at
all
clear
that
this
contract
gives
them
the
right
as
helpers
to
be
promoted
to
carmen
as
against
the
claim
of
apprentices
to
be
promoted
to
carmen,
and
this
is
a
matter
which
involves
the
expertise
of
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board
and
it's--
mr.
donald
w.fisher
that
is
the
issue
which
i
think
is
justiciable
in
the
courts,
mr.
justice.
we
concede
that
that
is
a
legally
jsuticiable
claim,
whether
he
is
being
discriminated
against
on
account
of
his
race,
not
the
contract
rights
that
he
has
under
the
agreement,
that
is
an
adjustment
board
matter,
but
whether
he
is
being
discriminated
against.
now,
to
the
extent
that
he's
suing
the
union
for
discriminating
against
him
and
is
a
member
of
the
union,
he
should
attempt
to
exhaust
his
union
remedies.
that
is
our
position.
he
made
no
attempt
and
it
is
clear
from
the
pleading
that
both
in
the
original
pleading
and
the
amending
com
--
pleading
--
mr.
donald
w.fisher
pardon
me?
mr.
donald
w.fisher
not
damages.
adjustment
board
grants
backpay
and,
however,
this
might
be
--
mr.
donald
w.fisher
justice
marshall
--
mr.
donald
w.fisher
there
is
no
jump
from
the
union
to
the
adjustment
board.
the
claim
against
the
union
is
not
a
claim
destined
for
resolution
by
the
adjustment
board.
mr.
donald
w.fisher
that
is
our
po
--
we
concede
that.
mr.
donald
w.fisher
well,
but
we
say,
yes,
but
we
say
also,
before
--
as
a
member
of
an
association,
before
they
attempt
to
sue
the
association
for
a
possible
act
of
misp
--
on
the
part
of
a
local
agent,
that
it
is
neat
and
proper,
and
is
so
recognized
under
federal
law
as
neat
and
proper,
to
attempt
to
get
this
matter
resolved
internally
and
within
the
organization.
and,
if
they
had
done
this
at
the
first
time
they
were
aware
of
any
discrimination,
it
is
entirely
possible
that
they
would
--
the
discrimination
would
have
been
eliminated,
but
they
never
filed
any
grievance,
any
claim
within
the
confines
of
the
brotherhood
to
the
effect
that
officials
at
birmingham
were
discriminating
against
them.
now,
we
say
that
that
type
of
exhaustion
of
remedy
under
the
union
constitution
is
necessary
under
law
and
it
is
necessary
in
fairness
to
the
union
because
the
union
can
be
held
liable
for
the
action
of
his
agents,
but
it
should
have
some
opportunity
to
take
corrective
action.
mr.
donald
w.fisher
i
--
yes,
if
they
had
attempted,
if
they
had
made
a
fair
bonafied
reasonable
attempt,
which
they
did
not
make
and
which
they
concede
they
didn't
make,
and
had
found
that
they
were
getting
no
relief.
i
think
that,
pursuant
to
the
law,
as
it
existed,
they
might
have
then
turned
to
the
courts
and
sought
relief,
but
they
made
no
attempt
--
mr.
donald
w.fisher
well,
the
remedy
i'm
talking
about
is
the
remedy
against
the
union,
the
remedy
that
they
sought
in
conley
versus
gibson.
mr.
donald
w.fisher
well,
conceivably,
in
the
claim
against
the
union.
mr.
donald
w.fisher
not
in
respect
to
their
claim
for
an
interpretation
or
application
of
the
language
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
that
is
a
matter
to
--
the
question
of
whether
they
were
actually
entitled
to
be
upgraded
to
carmen
or
whether
apprentices
were
improperly
upgraded
instead
of
them
is
a
question
that,
under
all
the
decisions
of
this
court,
it
seems
to
me,
must
be
resolved
by
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board.
mr.
donald
w.fisher
yes,
the
relief
under
the
contract
is
available
before
the
adjustment
board.
the
relief
against
the
union
and
the
relief
for
breach
of
the
duty,
the
relief
for
racial
discrimination,
for
breach
of
the
duty
fair
representation
is
a
claim
which
is
judicially
cognizable
for
which
recovery
may
be
made
after
proper
proof,
but
our
position
here
again
is
that
there
is
this
duty,
this
preliminary
duty,
which
is
i
think
well-embodied
in
federal
law
to
attempt
to
exhaust
the
remedies
available
to
them.
and,
they
concede,
i
do
want
to
emphasize
to
the
court,
that
they
had
in
no
point
ever
denied
that
there
are
remedies.they
refused
in
their
pleadings
to
spell
--
to
state
what
the
contract
remedies
are
and
what
the
union
constitutional
remedies
are,
but
they
have
taken
a
rather
cavalier
attitude
toward
these
remedies
and
said
"there's
no
need
for
us
to
attempt
to
exhaust
them."
we
feel
that
we're,
because
this
is
a
racial
case,
i
presume,
we're
immune
from
that
requirement
that
all
other
persons,
presumably,
are
imposed
with.
and,
that
is
the
--
mr.
donald
w.fisher
not
very
long,
and
--
mr.
donald
w.fisher
i
would
say
the
grievance
procedure
on
the
property,
if
you're
talking
about
the
railroad
property
--
mr.
donald
w.fisher
well,
the
grievance
is
two-fold.
they
had
a
grievance
against
the
union
--
mr.
donald
w.fisher
both
of
--
mr.
donald
w.fisher
alright,
both
of
them
together,
i
believe
that
they
could
have
processed
the
grievances
fully
in
less
than
two
years.
mr.
donald
w.fisher
less
than
two
years,
yes,
sir.
mr.
donald
w.fisher
no,
i
was
assuming
that
the
arbitration
board
decision
would
also
be
handed
down,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
that
the
entire
matter
could've
been
processed
on
the
property
to
the
adjustment
board
and
also
the
claim
within
the
union's
tribunals
to
make
the
union
do
what
they
say
the
union
wouldn't
do
in
less
than
two
years.
mr.
donald
w.fisher
no,
i
said
less
than
three
years,
but
my
co-counsel
of
the
carrier
pointed
out
a
report
which
i
then
read
and
the
case
--
the
backlog
is
less
than
a
year
on
the
second
division,
and
i
am
of
the
opinion
--
mr.
donald
w.fisher
i
said
less
than
three
years.
i
now
say
two
years
or
less.
two
years
or
less,
the
entire
matter
could've
been
processed
through
all
of
the
conceivable
tribunals
involved.
mr.
donald
w.fisher
through
the
courts,
mr.
justice
black?
mr.
donald
w.fisher
well
--
mr.
donald
w.fisher
well,
now,
a
decision
of
the
board,
of
course,
is
final
and
binding,
except
for
certain
limited
grounds
of
review.
so
that,
unless
those
grounds
were
available,
there
would
be
no
court
review.
mr.
donald
w.fisher
if
they
were
available,
i
would
hesitate
to
say
what
the
state
had
adopted
in
birmingham,
alabama,
as
in
the
courts.
it
would
be
longer.
thank
you.
mr.
donald
w.fisher
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
to
go
back
to
the
point
which
i
left
at
the
noon
recess,
in
talking
about
the
tungsten
case
and
the
steel
case,
it
seems
to
me,
that
the
carrier
and
the
brotherhood
again
say
that,
regardless
of
who
the
parties
were
in
those
cases,
the
cases
involved
the
question
of
the
duty
of
a
labor
union
to
accord
to
minority
members
of
a
craft
or
class
fair
representation.
and,
i
think
that's
put
in
sharp
outline
by
the
opening
statement
of
chief
justice
stone
who
said
the
question
is
whether
the
railway
labor
act
imposes
on
a
labor
organization,
acting
by
authority
of
the
statute
as
exclusive
bargaining
representative
of
a
craft
or
class
or
railway
employees,
the
duty
to
represent
all
the
employees
in
the
craft
without
discrimination
because
of
their
race
and,
if
so,
whether
the
courts
have
jurisdiction
to
protect
the
minority
of
the
craft
or
class
from
the
violation
of
such
obligation
and
point
out
further,
again,
regardless
of
who
the
parties
were,
that
was
the
issue,
that
the
court
also
noted
that
there
were
no
differences
between
the
parties
in
the
steel
case,
or
in
the
tungsten
case
for
that
matter,
as
to
the
interpretation
of
the
contract
at
page
205
of
the
court's
opinion
there's
--
nor
are
there
any
differences
as
to
the
interpretation
of
the
contract
which,
by
the
act,
are
committed
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
railroad
adjustment
board.
now,
in
the
tungsten
case,
it's
true
that
it
was
a
discriminatory
application
but,
again,
it
was
filled
in
that
case
that
the
union
was
the
party,
the
guilty
party,
the
most
guilty
party
that
violated
this
duty
of
fair
representation.
now,
again,
in
conley
versus
gibson,
the
thrust
was
against
the
union
for
refusing
to
process
these
grievances,
and
we
concede
in
this
case
that
the
union
cannot
discriminate.
there
is
no
problem,
in
my
mind,
about
that.
this
union
cannot
discriminate.
i
see
my
time
is
up.
mr.
donald
w.fisher
yes,
sir.
i
merely
want
to
say
that
this
case
presents
the
question
when
you're
suing
the
union
for
violation
of
that
duty
and
the
plaintiff
is
a
member.
even
though
he's
a
negro,
he's
a
member
of
the
union.doesn't
he
have
the
same
obligation
that
other
union
members
have
of
attempting
to
utilize
his
internal
remedies.
and,
the
question
of
the
interpretation
and
application
of
the
agreement,
which
mr.
acker
concede
is
at
the
root
of
this
case,
is
a
question
of
the
interpretation
of
the
contract.
there's
no
conceded
--
mr.
donald
w.fisher
well
--
mr.
donald
w.fisher
i
think
that's
--
they
had
a
however.
i
think,
yes,
sir.
i
re-read
it
and
they
did
make
that
observation,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
donald
w.fisher
well,
may
i
answer
the
question
this
way,
mr.
justice
white.
the
court
observed
in
those
days
that
the
adjustment
board
wouldn't
permit
individual
claimants
to
go
before
it.
it
said,
in
over
400
cases,
not
--
mr.
donald
w.fisher
yes,
alright.
mr.
donald
w.fisher
yes,
sir.
let
me
attempt
to
answer
it
directly
then,
if
i
may,
if
haven't
been
direct.
in
that
case,
they
were
talking
about
the
breach
of
the
union
of
its
duty
of
fair
representation
and
they
said
this
is
not
the
claim
that
you
go
to
the
adjustment
board,
and
i
will
concede
they
said
perhaps
it
wouldn't
be
a
fair
tribunal
in
weighing
the
union's
duty
because
it
was
a
union
appointed
representative
and
tribunal.
i
am
saying,
and
i
hope
that
i've
been
clear
in
this,
that
the
question
of
contract
interpretation,
pure
and
simple,
is
the
only
question
that
i
believe
is
properbly
--
properly
referable
to
the
adjustment
board.
and,
i
am
conceding
with
justice
marshall
and
with
other
justices
in
the
court
that
the
claim
for
breach
of
the
duty
to
treat
members
of
the
craft
or
class
fairly
is
a
claim
that
is
cognizable
in
the
court
and
i
say
on
that
claim,
which
is
a
judicially
cognizable
claim,
since
he's
a
member
of
the
union
suing
his
union,
he
should
first
make
some
attempts
to
exhaust
the
remedies.
if
he
had
done
that,
years
ago,
he
may
have
had
immediate
instantaneous
relief,
but
he
made
no
attempt
and
he
admits
that
he
made
no
attempt
to
exhaust
these
remedies.
mr.
donald
w.fisher
thank
you.
