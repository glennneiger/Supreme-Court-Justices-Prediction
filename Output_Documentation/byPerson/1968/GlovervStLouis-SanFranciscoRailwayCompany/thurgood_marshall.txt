justice

do
the
railway
adjustment
board
still
divide
it
equally
between
brotherhood
and
railroad?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and,
in
this
case,
don't
--
they're
not
alleged
that
there
has
been
cooperation
between
the
brotherhood
and
the
railroads?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
they
do
allege
that
they
are
working
together
against
their
best
interest,
do
they
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
then,
i
have
three
short
questions.
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
congress
adopted
an
act
which
said
"you
and
i
have
a
dispute,
you
shall
be
the
sole
arbiter
as
to
which
one
is
right,"
would
that
be
due
process?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
if
congress
passed
an
act
and
said
that
"if
i
had
a
dispute
with
you
and
somebody
else,
that
the
two
of
you
would
be
the
final
arbiters
as
to
which
side
was
right,"
would
that
be
due
process?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
wouldn't
be
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
what's
different
between
that
and
this
situation?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
expertise
does
the
railroad
adjustment
board
have
to
find
out
whether
a
man
is
being
discriminated
against
because
of
his
raise?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
is
there
anything
in
the
procedure
that
will
give
him
compensation
for
what
has
been
done
to
him
in
the
past?
certainly,
there's
not.
justice
thurgood
marshall
there's
no
procedure,
even
machinery
or
internal
union
brotherhood
machinery,
that
will
give
him
damages.
that's
true.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
for
one
have
difficult
in
jumping
from
the
union
to
the
adjustment
board.
i
mean
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
what
i
thought.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
alright.
well,
my
point
is
that
why
most
of
your
argument,
as
i
get
it,
is
the
assumption
of
what
they
cannot
prove,
but
the
point
before
us
is
to
whether
they
shall
be
given
an
opportunity
to
try
to
prove
that
there's
been
collusion
and
there's
been
this.
that's
all
they're
asking
for
here.
