i
take
it,
that
there's
no
question
that
the
individual

as

may
oper

may
energize
the
grievance

in
the
railroad
business.

the
statutes
permits

justice

doesn't
the

under

yes,
under

justice

let's
assume
that
a
collective
bargaining
contract
between
a
union
and
the
railroad
doesn't
say
anything
about
grievances.
then,
how

doesn't
the

still
require

minor

go

well,
how
do

around

well,
i
know.
it
doesn't
have
to.
justice

so
you're
just
saying
that
when
that
--
you're
just
saying
that
when
the
--
if
you
claim
racial
discrimination,
the
statutory
requirement
to
take
that
sort
of
a
claim
to
the

is

what's
the
basis
for
your
claim
that
you
don't
really
have
a
remedy
before
the

it
just
that
it's
inadequate
or
do
you
say
that
the

just
can't
handle
a
claim
by
an
emp

by
a
union
member
against
the
union.
justice
byron

that's
what
the
court
said
in
steel,
wasn't
it?
justice

but
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that
doesn't
go

that
doesn't
go
for
a

based
on
the
collective
bargaining
contract
that
he
signed.
justice
byron

well,
i'm
just
suggestion
that
steel
and
tungsten
didn't
hold
that
it--
that
the
employee
may
go
to
court
on
a
breach
of
a
collective
bargaining
contract
in
a
suit
against
the
employer.
justice
byron

they
may
be
able

those
cases
may
get
you
into

breach
of

duty
against
the

justice
byron
r.

let's
get
steel
and
tungsten
there
first.
neither
one
of
them
went
to
get
you
into
court
against
the
employer,
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
said
there
wasn't
--
justice
byron
r.
white
they
said
there
wasn't
any

they
said
there
wasn't
any
remedy

it
was
a
suit

justice
byron

white
yes,
well,
that's
kind
of
critical,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
do
you
get
around
steel
or
worse?
it
seems
to
me
that
it
says,
frankly,
that
this
kind
of
a
remedy
before
the
board,
this
isn't
the
kind
of
remedy
that
has
to
be
exhausted
because
of
the
factors
that
mr.
justice
harlan
had
mentioned
and
others.
steel
certainly
just
--
the
defense
was
there.
they
had
exhausted
the
remedies
and
the
court
has
just
--
just
said
that
remedy
isn't
much
of
a
remedy
when
this
kind
of
a
ch
--
a
great
charge
of
racial
discrimination
is
made.
justice
byron
r.
white
has
that
case
ever
been
modified
that
you
know
of?
justice
byron

white
you
mean
the
court
just
wasted
its
time
talking
about
this
remedy?
justice
byron

in
those
terms,
they
did.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
took
it
seriously.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
do
you
--
why
does
the
court
say
the
administrative
remedy
was
inadequate
in
steel
and
tungsten?
they
said
part
of
the
reason
was
that
it
was
not
an
unbiased
tribunal.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
both
sides,
both
parties
who
were
accused
of
discriminating
against
the
plaintiff
were
sitting
there
deciding
the
dispute.
that
was
part
of
the
reason.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
union
was
--
the
union
who
was
sitting
on
one
side
of
that
tribunal
was
so
biased
and
so
unreliable,
and
it's
not
the
attorneys
that
used
the
administrative
action.
why
would
you
still
suggest
that
the
union
was
the
unbiased
and
what
kind
of
a
suitable
remedy
inside
the
union?
