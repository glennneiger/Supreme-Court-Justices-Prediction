mr.
william
m.acker,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
petitioners,
glover
and
others,
were
the
plaintiffs
below.
this
case
comes
here
purely
and
simply
on
the
pleadings.
the
plaintiffs
were
14
railroad
carmen
helpers.
their
complaint
in
the
district
court
charged
a
cooperative
scheme
by
the
st.
louis-san
francisco
railroad
co.
and
their
brotherhood,
the
brotherhood
of
railway
carmen,
to
perpetuate
a
long-existing
racial
discrimination
in
the
area
of
seniority
by
the
device
of
using
what
they
call
apprentices
to
do
the
traditional
work
of
carmen
helpers.
they
use
quite
apprentices,
so
that
the
negro
carmen
helpers
will
continue
not
to
get
promoted
to
the
classification
of
carmen.
this
device
has
caused
a
bottleneck
in
seniority
which
affects
not
only
the
negro
carmen
helpers,
but
the
white
carmen
helpers
unfortunate
enough
to
be
behind
them
on
the
seniority
roster.
the
district
court
dismissed
the
complaint
on
the
ground
that
the
plaintiffs
had
not
alleged
in
exhaustion,
one,
of
their
remedy
before
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board,
two,
their
remedy
within
the
union
itself
and,
three,
their
remedy
provided
by
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
there
were
no
specific
allegations
in
the
complaint
as
to
the
character
of
these
two
supposed
contractual
remedies
or
even
if
they
existed,
but
the
district
court
nevertheless
concluded
that
they
both
were,
as
he
said,
"available"
and
must
be
employed.
the
fifth
circuit
affirmed
and
this
court
has
granted
certiorari.
let
me
say
that
some
people
don't
like
the
concept
of
seniority
as
the
criterion
for
job
assignment
and
promotion.
i
don't
think
it
is
for
me
to
be
for
or
against
this
concept.
it's
just
a
fact
of
labor
life,
and
racial
discrimination
in
the
application
of
this
concept
is
where
discrimination
hurts
the
most.
it
hurts
the
pocketbook,
and
i
submit
that
to
eliminate
invidious
discrimination
in
this
area
can
lead
ultimately
to
its
elimination
in
other
sectors
of
our
national
life.
while
i
was
on
the
airplane
coming
up
from
birmingham
with
the
plane
jumping
up
and
down,
i
grab
a
hold
on
something
to
get
my
mind
off
of
that
and
i
picked
up
the
"look"
magazine
for
this
week.
i
was
surprised
to
see
the
first
article
in
that
magazine
entitled
"what
unions
do
to
blacks."
as
i
turned
through
the
pages,
i
was
even
more
surprised
to
see
a
picture
of
one
of
my
clients.
i
mention
this
for
two
reasons.
one,
i
don't
want
the
court
to
think
that
i
had
anything
to
do
with
the
preparation
of
or
publication
of
this
article
just
before
this
case
is
set
for
oral
argument.
it
was
absolutely
news
to
me.
two,
despite
that
disclaimer,
there
are
a
couple
of
things
in
this
article
that
i'd
like
to
read
and
that
i
think
have
particular
bearing.
the
sub-headline
says
"for
nearly
a
century,
most
unions
have
forced
negros
into
jim
crow
logos,
giving
them
dirty
jobs
or
refuse
to
admit
them
at
all.
new
laws
and
repeated
union
promises
are
not
stopping
prejudice.
and
then,
down
in
the
body,
it
says
this.
"union
controlled
apprenticeship
programs,"
fits
this
one
like
a
glove,
"admit
far
less
than
token
numbers
of
negros,"
and
then
"unions
are
doggedly
battling
civil
rights
complaints
that
are
before
the
courts
and
government
agencies."
despite
landmark
court
decisions
in
1967
and
1968,
the
union
seemed
determined
to
fight
a
rear
guard
holding
action
reminiscent
of
the
one
thought
by
southern
school
districts
after
the
supreme
court's
1954
school
desegregation
decision.
now,
if
we
may,
let's
see
where
the
lower
court's
reasoning
in
this
case
would
lead
these
plaintiffs.
first,
what
about
the
internal
union
complaint
procedures?
the
trial
court
said
that
such
procedures
were
there
so,
for
the
sake
of
argument,
we'll
have
to
assume,
i
suppose,
that
they
are
there.
it
would
be
unbecoming
of
me
to
go
outside
the
record
to
describe
these
intra-union
procedures.
there
are
no
allegations
as
to
what
they
are,
no
allegations
by
the
plaintiffs,
no
allegations
by
the
defendants.
however,
i
think
in
--
it's
not
unsophisticated,
but
this
court,
just
as
i
know
it,
to
know
that
the
plaintiffs
could
not
get
damages.
damages,
that's
one
of
the
things
they
are
suing
for,
damages,
money
damages
for
past
discrimination
from
the
union.
if
they
go
through
the
union
constitution,
such
as
it
is,
are
they
going
to
be
able
to
ask
for
and
get
what
they're
asking
here,
damages?
it
is
just
as
easy,
i
think,
to
know
that
they
cannot
get
promotion
from
the
union.
the
union
doesn't
promote
people.
the
best
that
they
theoretically
could
hope
for
with
the
union
alone
would
be
an
admission
by
the
union
by
some
top
decision
making
body
or
policy
making
body
of
the
union
that
the
union
was
wrong
in
failing
to
take
their
grievance
to
the
company.
it's
all
they
could
hope
for
with
the
union
procedures.
mr.
william
m.acker,
jr.
yes,
we
do,
which
would
--
mr.
william
m.acker,
jr.
i
don't
know
that
that
word
is
used.
mr.
william
m.acker,
jr.
i
don't
think
it
is,
but
that's
--
mr.
william
m.acker,
jr.
exactly.
mr.
william
m.acker,
jr.
i
don't
think
they
could
get
damages
from
the
union
in
--
within
the
union
constitutional
procedures
but,
then,
we're
discussing
constitutional
procedures
within
the
union,
assuming
they
exist,
that
are
not
pledged.
and
if
the
court
does
not
have
any
way
to
know
what
those
procedures
are,
i
will
say
that
the
union
constitution
does
not
provide
a
method
for
the
union
to
compensate
someone
monetarily
for
some
wrongdoing,
and
that's
all
i'm
discussing
at
this
point,
is
what
they
could
get
there
theoretically.
now,
what
could
they
expect
from
the
company
if
they
process
the
grievance
without
the
union's
blessing
and
in
the
face
of
its
active
opposition?
the
actual
grievance
machinery
here
again
is
not
spelled
out
in
the
complaint
but,
in
these
matters,
it's
easy
to
know
that
they
would
get
nowhere.
if
they
sought
redress
with
the
company
in
the
face
and
in
the
teeth
of
their
own
union's
opposition
and
collusion
then,
according
to
the
fifth
circuit,
the
court
from
which
this
case
comes
in
haynes
against
u.s.
pipe,
a
case
that
was
cited
in
--
by
the
district
court
in
its
memorandum
opinion,
then
there
would
be
no
judicial
review.
the
fifth
circuit
is
not
saying
that
you
exhaust
your
administrative
remedies
within
the
company
and,
if
you're
not
satisfied,
you
then
go
to
court.
they're
saying,
in
haynes,
you
exhaust
your
administrative
remedy
within
the
company
even
if
the
last
and
ultimate
method
that
the
employee
employs
is
to
get
his
union
to
strike,
and
if
that
doesn't
work,
he's
finished.
this
is
what
the
fifth
circuit
says.
"at
this
point,
the
decision
denying
him
relief
was
final
under
the
terms
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
or
the
processes
of
the
now
available
to
him
for
contesting
or
avoiding
that
final
decision."
we're
talking
now
about
intra-company
procedures
and,
in
that
case,
the
fifth
circuit
said
"appellant
does
not
contend
that
the
union
did
not
faithfully
represent
him."
that
may
be
a
distinction.
he
does
not
charge
fraud
on
the
part
of
either
the
company
or
the
union.
this
is
a
run
of
the
mine
case
where
the
grievance
procedure
was
followed
and
the
adverse
decision
against
appellant
became
final.
being
dissatisfied,
he
sought
to
start
anew
in
the
face
of
the
bar
in
the
final
decision
under
the
grievance
procedure,
which
means
the
fifth
circuit
in
haynes
would
say
that
unless
the
plaintiffs
here
would
bite
off
the
tremendous
burden
after
having
exhausted
this
machinery
if
the
district
court
and
the
fifth
circuit
say
we
must
exhaust,
unless
we
want
to
bite
off
the
burden
and
take
on
the
burden
of
proving
fraud
on
the
part
of
the
union
in
the
company,
fraud,
then
we
have
no
judicial
review.
we've
reached
the
end
of
the
road
by
referring
this
matter
to
the
grievance
machine.
now,
what
could
the
plaintiffs
reasonably
expect
from
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board?
the
1966
revisions
of
the
railway
labor
act
came
too
late
for
mr.
glover
and
his
friends.
they
filed
this
case
in
1965.
the
carmen
in
their
brief
admit
to
an
average
of
three
years
for
processing
a
claim
before
the
nrab
second
division.
the
railroad
admits
to
less.
this
court
in
walker
against
the
southern
railway
was
not
only
impressed
by
the
unreasonable
delays
before
the
nrab,
before
the
1966
revisions
which
would
make
the
nrab
procedures
in
1965
applicable
here
just
as
in
walker,
but
by
the
absence
of
any
judicial
review
in
an
event
of
a
decision
adverse
to
the
individual
employee.
this
court
said
that
congress
also
found
if
an
employee
receives
an
award
in
his
favor
from
the
board,
the
railroad
affected
may
obtain
judicial
relief
of
that
award
by
declining
to
comply
with
it.
if,
however,
an
employee
fails
to
receive
an
award
in
his
favor,
there
is
no
means
by
which
judicial
review
may
be
obtained.
now,
that
point
is
argued
in
our
brief
at
some
length,
but
this
particular
case
was
not
referred
to
the
most
recent
at
that
point.
we
think
that,
as
constituted,
as
created,
as
conceived
by
the
congress,
the
nrab
is
not
able,
not
designed
for
handling
this
kind
of
grievance.
mr.
william
m.acker,
jr.
mr.
justice
white,
you
are
certainly
correct
because
i
have,
on
behalf
of
an
individual,
invoked
the
nrab
procedures.
mr.
william
m.acker,
jr.
it
does
permit
it.
mr.
william
m.acker,
jr.
you
mean
the
grievance
procedure
within
the
company
before
the
nrab
or
--
mr.
william
m.acker,
jr.
i
think
--
mr.
william
m.acker,
jr.
i
think
it
does,
your
honor.
mr.
william
m.acker,
jr.
by
its
terms.
mr.
william
m.acker,
jr.
wholly
independent
of
the
contract.
mr.
william
m.acker,
jr.
of
course,
i
don't
think
the
contract
here,
which
we
don't
have
before
us,
says
anything
about
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board.
mr.
william
m.acker,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
m.acker,
jr.
under
the
steel,
tungsten,
conley
rationale,
we
say
that
does
control
to
avoid
the
exclusive
jurisdiction.
now,
if
--
the
literal
words
require
it.
mr.
william
m.acker,
jr.
those
cases
--
mr.
william
m.acker,
jr.
as
i
interpret
them
and
as
i
hope
to
demonstrate,
do
say
that
in
this
context,
particularly
where
you're
suing
the
union,
and
this
court
in
several
cases
has
said
that
a
remedy
can
be
--
mr.
william
m.acker,
jr.
well,
my
own
personal
view,
mr.
justice
brennan,
would
be
that
this
particular
tribunal
as
constituted
with
an
absence
of
judicial
review
from
an
adverse
decision
to
an
employee,
if
the
congress
required
it
and
attempted
to
overrule
by
legislation
the
steel
and
tungsten
cases,
as
i
interpret
them,
then
i
think
the
congress
would've
enacted
unconstitutional
legislation,
that's
my
personal
view.
i
obviously
do
not
have
time
to
comment
on
all
of
the
important
cases
bearing
on
the
question
of
exhaustion
of
remedies,
but
i'd
like
to
discuss
these.
republic
steel
against
maddox,
vaca
against
sipes,
nr
--
nlrb
against
shipbuilding
local
22,
and
holton
against
scrant,
all
decided
by
this
court,
and
rothlein
against
armour
&
co.,
decided
very
recently
by
the
third
circuit.
if
i
had
any
time,
i'd
like
to
briefly
mention
conley
against
gibson
and
walker
against
southern
railway
and
in
republic
steel
against
maddox.
the
maddox
case,
first
off,
didn't
involve
a
claim
against
a
man's
union
as
well
as
the
company
for
which
he
worked.
the
majority
of
the
court
in
that
case
considered
it
a
run
of
the
mill
discharge
case
and
simply
held
that
mr.
maddox
should've
employed
the
grievance
machinery
which,
there,
was
clearly
provided
by
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
under
the
evidence.
if
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
was
there
for
the
court
to
examine
and
to
determine
that
it
was
available.
in
this
case,
it's
not
there.
it
hasn't
been
pled
by
us.
it
hasn't
been
pled
by
the
defendants.
and,
the
court
said
as
a
general
rule
in
cases
to
which
federal
law
applies,
federal
labor
policy
requires
that
individual
employees
wishing
to
assert
contract
grievances
must
attempt,
with
the
court's
emphasis,
"use
of
a
contract
grievance
procedure
agreed
upon
by
employer
and
union
as
the
mode
of
redress."
it
continued
"if
the
union
refuses
to
press
or
only
perfunctorily
presses
the
individual's
claim,
differences
may
arise
as
to
the
forms
of
redress
then
available,
but
unless
the
contract
provides
otherwise,
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
employee
must
afford
the
union
the
opportunity
to
act
on
his
behalf."
now,
we
amended
this
complaint
after
judge
linn
threw
as
out.
i
don't
know
that
we
added
anything,
really,
to
the
complaint
by
our
amendment
because,
in
the
original
complaint,
it
clearly
appeared
that
the
opportunity
for
the
union
to
process
this
grievance
had
been
afforded.
they
had
been
called
on
and
they
had
not
done
it.
so,
without
the
frustrating
responses,
short
of
the
actual
operation
of
the
grievance
machinery,
the
maddox
rationale
here,
as
i
have
read
it
here,
seems
to
me
to
clearly
apply.
more
recently,
the
court
spoke
in
vaca
against
sipes.
mr.
william
m.acker,
jr.
well
--
mr.
william
m.acker,
jr.
i
would
have
to
say
that
we
are.
mr.
william
m.acker,
jr.
we're
very
--
we
admit
to
being
--
mr.
william
m.acker,
jr.
for
asking
the
court
for
a
decision
which
very
definitely
will
involve
and
will
admit
an
interpretation
application
of
--
mr.
william
m.acker,
jr.
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
mr.
william
m.acker,
jr.
it
was
filed
in
june
or
july
of
1965,
mr.
justice
black.
it
was
in
the
works
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
civil
rights
act.
there
is
no
invocation
of
the
1964
civil
rights
act.
mr.
william
m.acker,
jr.
mr.
cooper's
firm
is
counsel
for
the
carmen,
locally
there
and
did
participate
in
the
lower
levels
of
the
court.
mr.
william
m.acker,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
it
was
not.
he
had
gone
before
that
time.
mr.
william
m.acker,
jr.
no,
sir,
no
question
whatsoever.
mr.
william
m.acker,
jr.
that's
right.
there's
no
statutory
provision
which
would
even
contemplate
that,
and
that's
what
the
conley
case
says.
mr.
william
m.acker,
jr.
in
steel
and
in
conley.
mr.
william
m.acker,
jr.
it
simply
said
that
there
was
no
--
mr.
william
m.acker,
jr.
no
mechanical
--
mr.
william
m.acker,
jr.
that's
true.
mr.
william
m.acker,
jr.
that's
true.
i
think
if
the
plaintiffs
had
won,
been
willing
to
forgo
any
claim
against
their
own
union
which
had
wronged
them
--
which
we
say
had
wronged
them.
if
they'd
been
willing
to
forgo
that
and
had
also
been
willing
to
submit
themselves
to
a
tribunal
composed
of
"representatives
from
the
--
mr.
william
m.acker,
jr.
well,
i
don't
know
whether
mr.
--
mr.
william
m.acker,
jr.
of
course,
i
don't
know
--
i
can't
remember
whether
mr.
justice
white
was
on
the
court
when
conley
against
gibson
was
decided,
but
the
respondents
here
had
never
answered
and
never
attempted
an
answer
as
to
the
significance
of
footnote
4
in
conley
against
gibson.
it's
conceivable,
i
suppose,
that
some
of
the
members
of
the
court
who
signed
the
unanimous
opinion
might
not
have
seen
what
that
footnote
was
clearly
saying.
i
don't
think
that's
true.
that
footnote
overrules
the
case
of
hayes
against
the
union
pacific
railroad.
it
says
it
was
decided
incorrectly.
there
was
only
one
question
in
hayes
against
the
union
pacific.
that
was
a
case
against
the
union
and
the
company.
mr.
william
m.acker,
jr.
i
think
they
would,
based
on
their
language.
now,
they're
certainly
distinguishable
on
the
facts,
as
far
as
--
mr.
william
m.acker,
jr.
the
union
being
present.
mr.
william
m.acker,
jr.
that's
one
thing
they
said.
mr.
william
m.acker,
jr.
i
think
it
is
one
critical
point
of
those
decisions,
but
i
do
think
that
they're
both
not
just
susceptible
by
a
sweeping
argument
to
conclude
from
it
that,
in
cases
where
invidious
discrimination
such
as
racial
discrimination
is
involved
and
the
doors
of
the
court
are
open.
i
think
they
are
susceptible
to
that
without
stretching
it
beyond
the
opinion,
beyond
what
they
say.
of
course,
those
cases
preceded
the
conley
case.
and
in
hayes
against
the
union
pacific,
that
was
purely
and
simply
a
case
where
the
employees
were
asking
for
an
interpretation
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
which
we
concede
we're
asking
for
and
the
company
was
--
the
prime
defendant
was
named
union
pacific
railroad
co.
this
court
held
in
that
case
where
the
charge
was
collusive
discrimination,
just
like
this
one,
unanimously
that
that
case
was
decided
wrong.
now,
if
the
court
meant
that,
as
i
think
they
did,
then
they
were
saying,
as
i
read
that
case,
that
in
all
cases.
now,
i
may
not
be
able
to
prove
this.
i'm
asking
for
an
opportunity
to
prove
it,
just
the
opportunity
to
prove
that
this
union
representing
them
and
this
company
got
together
at
their
expense.
and,
if
i
can
prove
that
and
if
any
plaintiffs
similarly
situated
and
can
make
a
charge
like
this
and
make
it
stick,
then
i
submit,
under
the
footnote
4
conley
against
gibson,
that
they
should
have
that
right
and
the
doors
of
the
court
should
be
open.
now,
in
vaca
against
sipes,
there
were
three
separate
viewpoints
expressed.
mr.
justice
black
adhered
to
his
dissent
in
maddox
and,
while
i
might
personally
agree
with
mr.
justice
black's
position
in
that
case,
the
case
should
be
reversed,
i
think,
on
the
reasoning
of
the
majority,
as
expressed
by
mr.
justice
white.
i
don't
believe
that
the
concurring
opinion
of
mr.
justice
fortas,
which
was
joined
in
by
mr.
justice's
harlan
and
--
i've
forgotten
which
other
--
the
court
joined
him,
doesn't
deal
with
the
issues
of
this
case,
but
the
majority
said
the
following
things
in
vaca.
mr.
william
m.acker,
jr.
that's
vaca
against
sipes.
i
have
the
lawyer's
edition,
17
law
edition
2nd
842.
mr.
william
m.acker,
jr.
the
preemption
doctrine,
however,
has
never
been
rigidly
applied
to
cases
where
it
could
not
be
fairly
be
inferred
that
congress
intended
exclusive
jurisdiction
to
lie
with
the
nlrb.
well,
this
is
an
nlrb
case
but
i
think
that
expression
equally
fits
the
nrab.
while
these
exceptions
in
no
way
undermine
the
validity
of
the
preemption
rule
were
applicable,
they
demonstrate
that
the
decision
to
preempt
federal
and
state
court
jurisdiction
over
a
given
class
of
cases
must
depend
upon
the
nature
of
the
particular
interests
being
asserted
and
the
effect
upon
the
administration
of
national
labor
policies
of
concurrent
judicial
and
administrative
remedies.
it
is
not
applicable
to
cases
involving
alleged
breaches
of
the
union's
duty
of
fair
representation,
which
i
think
applies
here.
it
can
be
doubted
whether
the
board
brings
substantially
greater
expertise
to
bear
on
these
problems
than
duly
courts
which
had
been
engaged
in
this
type
of
review
since
the
steel
decision.
in
addition
to
the
above
considerations,
the
unique
interests
served
by
the
duty
of
fair
representation
doctrine
have
a
profound
effect
in
our
opinion
on
the
applicability
of
the
preemption
rule
to
this
class
of
cases.
the
court
recognized
in
steel
that
the
congressional
grant
of
power
to
a
union
to
act
as
exclusive
collective
bargaining
representative
with
its
corresponding
reduction
in
the
individual
rights
of
the
employee,
so
represented,
would
raise
grave
constitutional
problems
if
unions
were
free
to
exercise
this
power
to
further
racial
discrimination.
since
that
landmark
decision,
the
duty
of
fair
representation
has
stood
as
a
bull
work
to
prevent
arbitrary
union
conduct
against
individuals
stripped
off
traditional
forms
of
redress
by
the
provisions
of
federal
labor
law.
however,
because
these
contractual
remedies
have
been
devised
and
are
often
controlled
by
the
union
and
the
employer,
they
may
well
prove
unsatisfactory
or
unworkable
for
the
individual
grievant.
an
obvious
situation
in
which
the
employee
should
not
be
limited
to
the
exclusive
remedial
procedures
established
by
the
contract
occurs
when
the
conduct
of
the
employer
amounts
to
a
repudiation
of
these
contractual
procedures.
we
say
"repudiation."
i
must
leave
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
william
m.acker,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
william
m.acker,
jr.
just
a
couple
of
remarks.
as
i
understand
mr.
fisher,
he
is
saying
that
these
plaintiffs
must
go
and
must
have
gone
three
separate
routes
and
that
they
must
fragment
their
claim,
that
is
that
they
must
take
their
union
claim
to
the
union,
and
their
claim
against
the
company
to
the
company
grievance
machinery
and,
thereafter,
to
the
railroad
adjustment
board.
i
don't
think
that
could
be
done
in
two
years,
whether
you
did
it
simultaneously
or
not
but,
in
any
rate,
he's
requiring
a
fragmentation
and
he
is
saying
that
there's
no
right
at
any
time
anywhere
to
sue
the
union
and
the
company
together
in
one
--
before
one
tribunal.
now,
that
ground
was
not
in
the
motion
to
dismiss.
they
don't
day
in
the
motion
to
dismiss
that
you
have
no
right
in
this
court
to
sue
these
two
entities
together.
they
say
that
here.
as
to
footnote
4
of
conley
against
gibson,
i
think
what
mr.
fisher
is
saying
is
that
footnote
4
went
further
than
the
court
needed
to
go
to
decide
that
particular
case
and,
therefore,
it's
dictum.
and,
he
might
be
right
there,
but
i
do
think
that
what
the
court
said
in
that
footnote
4
was
carefully
reasoned
and
was
correct
and
should
become
the
law
in
any
case
where,
very
clearly,
that
question
that
appeared
in
hayes
against
union
pacific
is
presented.
no
question
about
that
in
this
case.
now,
as
to
one
other
thing
--
my
time
is
--
mr.
william
m.acker,
jr.
one
other
thing,
the
remark
was
made
and
was
made
in
briefs
that
mr.
dent
has
availed
himself
of
the
remedy
provided
him
or
attempted
to,
he's
been
unsuccessful
thus
far,
the
remedy
provided
by
the
civil
rights
act
in
1964,
in
which
i'm
not
involved.
now,
i
will
say
only
one
thing
there.this
case
here
certainly
should
not
rise
or
fall
on
what
one
of
the
petitioners
here
is
doing
in
another
case,
outside
the
control
of
counsel
in
this
case.
but,
if
mr.
dent
is
successful
there,
ultimately
after
having
them
thrown
out
there
as
he
was
here,
he
will
not
be
entitled
in
the
civil
rights
act
to
damages,
which
is
what
we're
talking
about
when
we're
talking
about
laws
of
seniority
in
job
rights.
we're
talking
about
money.
thank
you.
mr.
william
m.acker,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
petitioners,
glover
and
others,
were
the
plaintiffs
below.
this
case
comes
here
purely
and
simply
on
the
pleadings.
the
plaintiffs
were
14
railroad
carmen
helpers.
their
complaint
in
the
district
court
charged
a
cooperative
scheme
by
the
st.
louis-san
francisco
railroad
co.
and
their
brotherhood,
the
brotherhood
of
railway
carmen,
to
perpetuate
a
long-existing
racial
discrimination
in
the
area
of
seniority
by
the
device
of
using
what
they
call
apprentices
to
do
the
traditional
work
of
carmen
helpers.
they
use
quite
apprentices,
so
that
the
negro
carmen
helpers
will
continue
not
to
get
promoted
to
the
classification
of
carmen.
this
device
has
caused
a
bottleneck
in
seniority
which
affects
not
only
the
negro
carmen
helpers,
but
the
white
carmen
helpers
unfortunate
enough
to
be
behind
them
on
the
seniority
roster.
the
district
court
dismissed
the
complaint
on
the
ground
that
the
plaintiffs
had
not
alleged
in
exhaustion,
one,
of
their
remedy
before
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board,
two,
their
remedy
within
the
union
itself
and,
three,
their
remedy
provided
by
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
there
were
no
specific
allegations
in
the
complaint
as
to
the
character
of
these
two
supposed
contractual
remedies
or
even
if
they
existed,
but
the
district
court
nevertheless
concluded
that
they
both
were,
as
he
said,
"available"
and
must
be
employed.
the
fifth
circuit
affirmed
and
this
court
has
granted
certiorari.
let
me
say
that
some
people
don't
like
the
concept
of
seniority
as
the
criterion
for
job
assignment
and
promotion.
i
don't
think
it
is
for
me
to
be
for
or
against
this
concept.
it's
just
a
fact
of
labor
life,
and
racial
discrimination
in
the
application
of
this
concept
is
where
discrimination
hurts
the
most.
it
hurts
the
pocketbook,
and
i
submit
that
to
eliminate
invidious
discrimination
in
this
area
can
lead
ultimately
to
its
elimination
in
other
sectors
of
our
national
life.
while
i
was
on
the
airplane
coming
up
from
birmingham
with
the
plane
jumping
up
and
down,
i
grab
a
hold
on
something
to
get
my
mind
off
of
that
and
i
picked
up
the
"look"
magazine
for
this
week.
i
was
surprised
to
see
the
first
article
in
that
magazine
entitled
"what
unions
do
to
blacks."
as
i
turned
through
the
pages,
i
was
even
more
surprised
to
see
a
picture
of
one
of
my
clients.
i
mention
this
for
two
reasons.
one,
i
don't
want
the
court
to
think
that
i
had
anything
to
do
with
the
preparation
of
or
publication
of
this
article
just
before
this
case
is
set
for
oral
argument.
it
was
absolutely
news
to
me.
two,
despite
that
disclaimer,
there
are
a
couple
of
things
in
this
article
that
i'd
like
to
read
and
that
i
think
have
particular
bearing.
the
sub-headline
says
"for
nearly
a
century,
most
unions
have
forced
negros
into
jim
crow
logos,
giving
them
dirty
jobs
or
refuse
to
admit
them
at
all.
new
laws
and
repeated
union
promises
are
not
stopping
prejudice.
and
then,
down
in
the
body,
it
says
this.
"union
controlled
apprenticeship
programs,"
fits
this
one
like
a
glove,
"admit
far
less
than
token
numbers
of
negros,"
and
then
"unions
are
doggedly
battling
civil
rights
complaints
that
are
before
the
courts
and
government
agencies."
despite
landmark
court
decisions
in
1967
and
1968,
the
union
seemed
determined
to
fight
a
rear
guard
holding
action
reminiscent
of
the
one
thought
by
southern
school
districts
after
the
supreme
court's
1954
school
desegregation
decision.
now,
if
we
may,
let's
see
where
the
lower
court's
reasoning
in
this
case
would
lead
these
plaintiffs.
first,
what
about
the
internal
union
complaint
procedures?
the
trial
court
said
that
such
procedures
were
there
so,
for
the
sake
of
argument,
we'll
have
to
assume,
i
suppose,
that
they
are
there.
it
would
be
unbecoming
of
me
to
go
outside
the
record
to
describe
these
intra-union
procedures.
there
are
no
allegations
as
to
what
they
are,
no
allegations
by
the
plaintiffs,
no
allegations
by
the
defendants.
however,
i
think
in
--
it's
not
unsophisticated,
but
this
court,
just
as
i
know
it,
to
know
that
the
plaintiffs
could
not
get
damages.
damages,
that's
one
of
the
things
they
are
suing
for,
damages,
money
damages
for
past
discrimination
from
the
union.
if
they
go
through
the
union
constitution,
such
as
it
is,
are
they
going
to
be
able
to
ask
for
and
get
what
they're
asking
here,
damages?
it
is
just
as
easy,
i
think,
to
know
that
they
cannot
get
promotion
from
the
union.
the
union
doesn't
promote
people.
the
best
that
they
theoretically
could
hope
for
with
the
union
alone
would
be
an
admission
by
the
union
by
some
top
decision
making
body
or
policy
making
body
of
the
union
that
the
union
was
wrong
in
failing
to
take
their
grievance
to
the
company.
it's
all
they
could
hope
for
with
the
union
procedures.
mr.
william
m.acker,
jr.
yes,
we
do,
which
would
--
mr.
william
m.acker,
jr.
i
don't
know
that
that
word
is
used.
mr.
william
m.acker,
jr.
i
don't
think
it
is,
but
that's
--
mr.
william
m.acker,
jr.
exactly.
mr.
william
m.acker,
jr.
i
don't
think
they
could
get
damages
from
the
union
in
--
within
the
union
constitutional
procedures
but,
then,
we're
discussing
constitutional
procedures
within
the
union,
assuming
they
exist,
that
are
not
pledged.
and
if
the
court
does
not
have
any
way
to
know
what
those
procedures
are,
i
will
say
that
the
union
constitution
does
not
provide
a
method
for
the
union
to
compensate
someone
monetarily
for
some
wrongdoing,
and
that's
all
i'm
discussing
at
this
point,
is
what
they
could
get
there
theoretically.
now,
what
could
they
expect
from
the
company
if
they
process
the
grievance
without
the
union's
blessing
and
in
the
face
of
its
active
opposition?
the
actual
grievance
machinery
here
again
is
not
spelled
out
in
the
complaint
but,
in
these
matters,
it's
easy
to
know
that
they
would
get
nowhere.
if
they
sought
redress
with
the
company
in
the
face
and
in
the
teeth
of
their
own
union's
opposition
and
collusion
then,
according
to
the
fifth
circuit,
the
court
from
which
this
case
comes
in
haynes
against
u.s.
pipe,
a
case
that
was
cited
in
--
by
the
district
court
in
its
memorandum
opinion,
then
there
would
be
no
judicial
review.
the
fifth
circuit
is
not
saying
that
you
exhaust
your
administrative
remedies
within
the
company
and,
if
you're
not
satisfied,
you
then
go
to
court.
they're
saying,
in
haynes,
you
exhaust
your
administrative
remedy
within
the
company
even
if
the
last
and
ultimate
method
that
the
employee
employs
is
to
get
his
union
to
strike,
and
if
that
doesn't
work,
he's
finished.
this
is
what
the
fifth
circuit
says.
"at
this
point,
the
decision
denying
him
relief
was
final
under
the
terms
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
or
the
processes
of
the
now
available
to
him
for
contesting
or
avoiding
that
final
decision."
we're
talking
now
about
intra-company
procedures
and,
in
that
case,
the
fifth
circuit
said
"appellant
does
not
contend
that
the
union
did
not
faithfully
represent
him."
that
may
be
a
distinction.
he
does
not
charge
fraud
on
the
part
of
either
the
company
or
the
union.
this
is
a
run
of
the
mine
case
where
the
grievance
procedure
was
followed
and
the
adverse
decision
against
appellant
became
final.
being
dissatisfied,
he
sought
to
start
anew
in
the
face
of
the
bar
in
the
final
decision
under
the
grievance
procedure,
which
means
the
fifth
circuit
in
haynes
would
say
that
unless
the
plaintiffs
here
would
bite
off
the
tremendous
burden
after
having
exhausted
this
machinery
if
the
district
court
and
the
fifth
circuit
say
we
must
exhaust,
unless
we
want
to
bite
off
the
burden
and
take
on
the
burden
of
proving
fraud
on
the
part
of
the
union
in
the
company,
fraud,
then
we
have
no
judicial
review.
we've
reached
the
end
of
the
road
by
referring
this
matter
to
the
grievance
machine.
now,
what
could
the
plaintiffs
reasonably
expect
from
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board?
the
1966
revisions
of
the
railway
labor
act
came
too
late
for
mr.
glover
and
his
friends.
they
filed
this
case
in
1965.
the
carmen
in
their
brief
admit
to
an
average
of
three
years
for
processing
a
claim
before
the
nrab
second
division.
the
railroad
admits
to
less.
this
court
in
walker
against
the
southern
railway
was
not
only
impressed
by
the
unreasonable
delays
before
the
nrab,
before
the
1966
revisions
which
would
make
the
nrab
procedures
in
1965
applicable
here
just
as
in
walker,
but
by
the
absence
of
any
judicial
review
in
an
event
of
a
decision
adverse
to
the
individual
employee.
this
court
said
that
congress
also
found
if
an
employee
receives
an
award
in
his
favor
from
the
board,
the
railroad
affected
may
obtain
judicial
relief
of
that
award
by
declining
to
comply
with
it.
if,
however,
an
employee
fails
to
receive
an
award
in
his
favor,
there
is
no
means
by
which
judicial
review
may
be
obtained.
now,
that
point
is
argued
in
our
brief
at
some
length,
but
this
particular
case
was
not
referred
to
the
most
recent
at
that
point.
we
think
that,
as
constituted,
as
created,
as
conceived
by
the
congress,
the
nrab
is
not
able,
not
designed
for
handling
this
kind
of
grievance.
mr.
william
m.acker,
jr.
mr.
justice
white,
you
are
certainly
correct
because
i
have,
on
behalf
of
an
individual,
invoked
the
nrab
procedures.
mr.
william
m.acker,
jr.
it
does
permit
it.
mr.
william
m.acker,
jr.
you
mean
the
grievance
procedure
within
the
company
before
the
nrab
or
--
mr.
william
m.acker,
jr.
i
think
--
mr.
william
m.acker,
jr.
i
think
it
does,
your
honor.
mr.
william
m.acker,
jr.
by
its
terms.
mr.
william
m.acker,
jr.
wholly
independent
of
the
contract.
mr.
william
m.acker,
jr.
of
course,
i
don't
think
the
contract
here,
which
we
don't
have
before
us,
says
anything
about
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board.
mr.
william
m.acker,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
m.acker,
jr.
under
the
steel,
tungsten,
conley
rationale,
we
say
that
does
control
to
avoid
the
exclusive
jurisdiction.
now,
if
--
the
literal
words
require
it.
mr.
william
m.acker,
jr.
those
cases
--
mr.
william
m.acker,
jr.
as
i
interpret
them
and
as
i
hope
to
demonstrate,
do
say
that
in
this
context,
particularly
where
you're
suing
the
union,
and
this
court
in
several
cases
has
said
that
a
remedy
can
be
--
mr.
william
m.acker,
jr.
well,
my
own
personal
view,
mr.
justice
brennan,
would
be
that
this
particular
tribunal
as
constituted
with
an
absence
of
judicial
review
from
an
adverse
decision
to
an
employee,
if
the
congress
required
it
and
attempted
to
overrule
by
legislation
the
steel
and
tungsten
cases,
as
i
interpret
them,
then
i
think
the
congress
would've
enacted
unconstitutional
legislation,
that's
my
personal
view.
i
obviously
do
not
have
time
to
comment
on
all
of
the
important
cases
bearing
on
the
question
of
exhaustion
of
remedies,
but
i'd
like
to
discuss
these.
republic
steel
against
maddox,
vaca
against
sipes,
nr
--
nlrb
against
shipbuilding
local
22,
and
holton
against
scrant,
all
decided
by
this
court,
and
rothlein
against
armour
&
co.,
decided
very
recently
by
the
third
circuit.
if
i
had
any
time,
i'd
like
to
briefly
mention
conley
against
gibson
and
walker
against
southern
railway
and
in
republic
steel
against
maddox.
the
maddox
case,
first
off,
didn't
involve
a
claim
against
a
man's
union
as
well
as
the
company
for
which
he
worked.
the
majority
of
the
court
in
that
case
considered
it
a
run
of
the
mill
discharge
case
and
simply
held
that
mr.
maddox
should've
employed
the
grievance
machinery
which,
there,
was
clearly
provided
by
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
under
the
evidence.
if
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
was
there
for
the
court
to
examine
and
to
determine
that
it
was
available.
in
this
case,
it's
not
there.
it
hasn't
been
pled
by
us.
it
hasn't
been
pled
by
the
defendants.
and,
the
court
said
as
a
general
rule
in
cases
to
which
federal
law
applies,
federal
labor
policy
requires
that
individual
employees
wishing
to
assert
contract
grievances
must
attempt,
with
the
court's
emphasis,
"use
of
a
contract
grievance
procedure
agreed
upon
by
employer
and
union
as
the
mode
of
redress."
it
continued
"if
the
union
refuses
to
press
or
only
perfunctorily
presses
the
individual's
claim,
differences
may
arise
as
to
the
forms
of
redress
then
available,
but
unless
the
contract
provides
otherwise,
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
employee
must
afford
the
union
the
opportunity
to
act
on
his
behalf."
now,
we
amended
this
complaint
after
judge
linn
threw
as
out.
i
don't
know
that
we
added
anything,
really,
to
the
complaint
by
our
amendment
because,
in
the
original
complaint,
it
clearly
appeared
that
the
opportunity
for
the
union
to
process
this
grievance
had
been
afforded.
they
had
been
called
on
and
they
had
not
done
it.
so,
without
the
frustrating
responses,
short
of
the
actual
operation
of
the
grievance
machinery,
the
maddox
rationale
here,
as
i
have
read
it
here,
seems
to
me
to
clearly
apply.
more
recently,
the
court
spoke
in
vaca
against
sipes.
mr.
william
m.acker,
jr.
well
--
mr.
william
m.acker,
jr.
i
would
have
to
say
that
we
are.
mr.
william
m.acker,
jr.
we're
very
--
we
admit
to
being
--
mr.
william
m.acker,
jr.
for
asking
the
court
for
a
decision
which
very
definitely
will
involve
and
will
admit
an
interpretation
application
of
--
mr.
william
m.acker,
jr.
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
mr.
william
m.acker,
jr.
it
was
filed
in
june
or
july
of
1965,
mr.
justice
black.
it
was
in
the
works
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
civil
rights
act.
there
is
no
invocation
of
the
1964
civil
rights
act.
mr.
william
m.acker,
jr.
mr.
cooper's
firm
is
counsel
for
the
carmen,
locally
there
and
did
participate
in
the
lower
levels
of
the
court.
mr.
william
m.acker,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
it
was
not.
he
had
gone
before
that
time.
mr.
william
m.acker,
jr.
no,
sir,
no
question
whatsoever.
mr.
william
m.acker,
jr.
that's
right.
there's
no
statutory
provision
which
would
even
contemplate
that,
and
that's
what
the
conley
case
says.
mr.
william
m.acker,
jr.
in
steel
and
in
conley.
mr.
william
m.acker,
jr.
it
simply
said
that
there
was
no
--
mr.
william
m.acker,
jr.
no
mechanical
--
mr.
william
m.acker,
jr.
that's
true.
mr.
william
m.acker,
jr.
that's
true.
i
think
if
the
plaintiffs
had
won,
been
willing
to
forgo
any
claim
against
their
own
union
which
had
wronged
them
--
which
we
say
had
wronged
them.
if
they'd
been
willing
to
forgo
that
and
had
also
been
willing
to
submit
themselves
to
a
tribunal
composed
of
"representatives
from
the
--
mr.
william
m.acker,
jr.
well,
i
don't
know
whether
mr.
--
mr.
william
m.acker,
jr.
of
course,
i
don't
know
--
i
can't
remember
whether
mr.
justice
white
was
on
the
court
when
conley
against
gibson
was
decided,
but
the
respondents
here
had
never
answered
and
never
attempted
an
answer
as
to
the
significance
of
footnote
4
in
conley
against
gibson.
it's
conceivable,
i
suppose,
that
some
of
the
members
of
the
court
who
signed
the
unanimous
opinion
might
not
have
seen
what
that
footnote
was
clearly
saying.
i
don't
think
that's
true.
that
footnote
overrules
the
case
of
hayes
against
the
union
pacific
railroad.
it
says
it
was
decided
incorrectly.
there
was
only
one
question
in
hayes
against
the
union
pacific.
that
was
a
case
against
the
union
and
the
company.
mr.
william
m.acker,
jr.
i
think
they
would,
based
on
their
language.
now,
they're
certainly
distinguishable
on
the
facts,
as
far
as
--
mr.
william
m.acker,
jr.
the
union
being
present.
mr.
william
m.acker,
jr.
that's
one
thing
they
said.
mr.
william
m.acker,
jr.
i
think
it
is
one
critical
point
of
those
decisions,
but
i
do
think
that
they're
both
not
just
susceptible
by
a
sweeping
argument
to
conclude
from
it
that,
in
cases
where
invidious
discrimination
such
as
racial
discrimination
is
involved
and
the
doors
of
the
court
are
open.
i
think
they
are
susceptible
to
that
without
stretching
it
beyond
the
opinion,
beyond
what
they
say.
of
course,
those
cases
preceded
the
conley
case.
and
in
hayes
against
the
union
pacific,
that
was
purely
and
simply
a
case
where
the
employees
were
asking
for
an
interpretation
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
which
we
concede
we're
asking
for
and
the
company
was
--
the
prime
defendant
was
named
union
pacific
railroad
co.
this
court
held
in
that
case
where
the
charge
was
collusive
discrimination,
just
like
this
one,
unanimously
that
that
case
was
decided
wrong.
now,
if
the
court
meant
that,
as
i
think
they
did,
then
they
were
saying,
as
i
read
that
case,
that
in
all
cases.
now,
i
may
not
be
able
to
prove
this.
i'm
asking
for
an
opportunity
to
prove
it,
just
the
opportunity
to
prove
that
this
union
representing
them
and
this
company
got
together
at
their
expense.
and,
if
i
can
prove
that
and
if
any
plaintiffs
similarly
situated
and
can
make
a
charge
like
this
and
make
it
stick,
then
i
submit,
under
the
footnote
4
conley
against
gibson,
that
they
should
have
that
right
and
the
doors
of
the
court
should
be
open.
now,
in
vaca
against
sipes,
there
were
three
separate
viewpoints
expressed.
mr.
justice
black
adhered
to
his
dissent
in
maddox
and,
while
i
might
personally
agree
with
mr.
justice
black's
position
in
that
case,
the
case
should
be
reversed,
i
think,
on
the
reasoning
of
the
majority,
as
expressed
by
mr.
justice
white.
i
don't
believe
that
the
concurring
opinion
of
mr.
justice
fortas,
which
was
joined
in
by
mr.
justice's
harlan
and
--
i've
forgotten
which
other
--
the
court
joined
him,
doesn't
deal
with
the
issues
of
this
case,
but
the
majority
said
the
following
things
in
vaca.
mr.
william
m.acker,
jr.
that's
vaca
against
sipes.
i
have
the
lawyer's
edition,
17
law
edition
2nd
842.
mr.
william
m.acker,
jr.
the
preemption
doctrine,
however,
has
never
been
rigidly
applied
to
cases
where
it
could
not
be
fairly
be
inferred
that
congress
intended
exclusive
jurisdiction
to
lie
with
the
nlrb.
well,
this
is
an
nlrb
case
but
i
think
that
expression
equally
fits
the
nrab.
while
these
exceptions
in
no
way
undermine
the
validity
of
the
preemption
rule
were
applicable,
they
demonstrate
that
the
decision
to
preempt
federal
and
state
court
jurisdiction
over
a
given
class
of
cases
must
depend
upon
the
nature
of
the
particular
interests
being
asserted
and
the
effect
upon
the
administration
of
national
labor
policies
of
concurrent
judicial
and
administrative
remedies.
it
is
not
applicable
to
cases
involving
alleged
breaches
of
the
union's
duty
of
fair
representation,
which
i
think
applies
here.
it
can
be
doubted
whether
the
board
brings
substantially
greater
expertise
to
bear
on
these
problems
than
duly
courts
which
had
been
engaged
in
this
type
of
review
since
the
steel
decision.
in
addition
to
the
above
considerations,
the
unique
interests
served
by
the
duty
of
fair
representation
doctrine
have
a
profound
effect
in
our
opinion
on
the
applicability
of
the
preemption
rule
to
this
class
of
cases.
the
court
recognized
in
steel
that
the
congressional
grant
of
power
to
a
union
to
act
as
exclusive
collective
bargaining
representative
with
its
corresponding
reduction
in
the
individual
rights
of
the
employee,
so
represented,
would
raise
grave
constitutional
problems
if
unions
were
free
to
exercise
this
power
to
further
racial
discrimination.
since
that
landmark
decision,
the
duty
of
fair
representation
has
stood
as
a
bull
work
to
prevent
arbitrary
union
conduct
against
individuals
stripped
off
traditional
forms
of
redress
by
the
provisions
of
federal
labor
law.
however,
because
these
contractual
remedies
have
been
devised
and
are
often
controlled
by
the
union
and
the
employer,
they
may
well
prove
unsatisfactory
or
unworkable
for
the
individual
grievant.
an
obvious
situation
in
which
the
employee
should
not
be
limited
to
the
exclusive
remedial
procedures
established
by
the
contract
occurs
when
the
conduct
of
the
employer
amounts
to
a
repudiation
of
these
contractual
procedures.
we
say
"repudiation."
i
must
leave
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
william
m.acker,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
william
m.acker,
jr.
just
a
couple
of
remarks.
as
i
understand
mr.
fisher,
he
is
saying
that
these
plaintiffs
must
go
and
must
have
gone
three
separate
routes
and
that
they
must
fragment
their
claim,
that
is
that
they
must
take
their
union
claim
to
the
union,
and
their
claim
against
the
company
to
the
company
grievance
machinery
and,
thereafter,
to
the
railroad
adjustment
board.
i
don't
think
that
could
be
done
in
two
years,
whether
you
did
it
simultaneously
or
not
but,
in
any
rate,
he's
requiring
a
fragmentation
and
he
is
saying
that
there's
no
right
at
any
time
anywhere
to
sue
the
union
and
the
company
together
in
one
--
before
one
tribunal.
now,
that
ground
was
not
in
the
motion
to
dismiss.
they
don't
day
in
the
motion
to
dismiss
that
you
have
no
right
in
this
court
to
sue
these
two
entities
together.
they
say
that
here.
as
to
footnote
4
of
conley
against
gibson,
i
think
what
mr.
fisher
is
saying
is
that
footnote
4
went
further
than
the
court
needed
to
go
to
decide
that
particular
case
and,
therefore,
it's
dictum.
and,
he
might
be
right
there,
but
i
do
think
that
what
the
court
said
in
that
footnote
4
was
carefully
reasoned
and
was
correct
and
should
become
the
law
in
any
case
where,
very
clearly,
that
question
that
appeared
in
hayes
against
union
pacific
is
presented.
no
question
about
that
in
this
case.
now,
as
to
one
other
thing
--
my
time
is
--
mr.
william
m.acker,
jr.
one
other
thing,
the
remark
was
made
and
was
made
in
briefs
that
mr.
dent
has
availed
himself
of
the
remedy
provided
him
or
attempted
to,
he's
been
unsuccessful
thus
far,
the
remedy
provided
by
the
civil
rights
act
in
1964,
in
which
i'm
not
involved.
now,
i
will
say
only
one
thing
there.this
case
here
certainly
should
not
rise
or
fall
on
what
one
of
the
petitioners
here
is
doing
in
another
case,
outside
the
control
of
counsel
in
this
case.
but,
if
mr.
dent
is
successful
there,
ultimately
after
having
them
thrown
out
there
as
he
was
here,
he
will
not
be
entitled
in
the
civil
rights
act
to
damages,
which
is
what
we're
