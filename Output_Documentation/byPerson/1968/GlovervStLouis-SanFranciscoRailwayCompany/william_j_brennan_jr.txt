well,
hayes
was
a
suit
who
was
charged
with
discrimination
against
negro
employees,
such
as
here,
in
the
enforcement
of
the
department
employee
right.
and,
it
was
held
there
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth

that
the
act
should
not
lie
by
reason
of
provision
for

in

justice
william

hayes
actually
was
a
suit
against
the
railroad
charged
with
stipulation
by
the
railroad
against
the

members
for
making
the
seniority

proposal,
precisely
the

with

we

justice
william
j.
brennan,

here,
we
have
the
facts
that
this
allegation
is
made
in
this
case
as
collusive
arrangement
between
the
railroads
and
the
union.
justice
william
j.
brennan,

it
would
be
only
against
the
railroad
but
not
against
the
--
also
against
the

is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

well,
it's
only
two-paragraphs
long
and
i've
given
you
about
all
of

do
you

representation?
justice
william

do
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

well,
i
have
a

bore

breach

to
afford
the

only
access

the

they
recovered
at
tungsten,
clearly,
the
plain
application
as

what
was
said

not

you
just
can't
take
a

force
the

that
you'll

well,
tungsten
and
steel
went
on
to
say
the
remedy
against
the

before

board
is
not
immensely
straight
into

because
it
will
make

quite

an

the

discriminatory
application
in
matters
of

stand
the
