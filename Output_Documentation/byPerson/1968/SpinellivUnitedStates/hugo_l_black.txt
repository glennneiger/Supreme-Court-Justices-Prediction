you

what

do
you

there
anything

determine
what

justice

that
while
the

as
i
understand

can
it
be
escaped
here

anything

i
don't

justice
hugo

black
the
commissioner
was
entitled
to
find
that
this
was
a
reliable

is
just
the

as
if
you'd
said
he
was
a
banker

a

the
affidavit
stated
that,
didn't
it?
justice

what
i
ask
for
is,
was
he
not
entitled
to
find
that
the
information
it
had
came
from
a
reliable
informer
based
on
the
oath
of
the
officer.

did
what?
justice
hugo

oh
you
think
aguilar
said
something
different?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
think
it
requires
the
commissioner
to
ignore
the
oath
of
the
officer
that
his
information
came
from
a
reliable
source
and
go
into
detail

prove

the

of

by
what?
justice

except
that
he
said
in
--
and
that
he
was
a
reliable
informant.
why
isn't
that
just
as
good
as
swearing
that
he
is
a
minister
of
the
gospel?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
you
have
to
go
into
detail
any
more
than
to
say
it
if
you
know
he's
reliable
at
least
in
a
preliminary
thing
like
a
search
warrant?
justice

you
think
it
will
have
difficulty
in
maintaining
it
before

do
you
think
it
would
have
difficulty
in
maintaining
it
as
a
matter
of
common

justice
hugo

black
and
affidavit,
that
the
witnesses
rely
upon?
do
you
think
it
require
something
more
swearing
under
oath
that
the
information
came
in
person
to
the
fbi
knows
to
be
reliable?
justice
hugo

where
was
this
all
of
it,
the

information?
justice

black
was
all
of
it
hearsay,
all
the
information
given
to
the
commissioner
a
hearsay?
justice

because
i'm
talking
about
this

justice

i'm
not
talking
about
aguilar,
i
meant
this
case.
it
was
not.
justice

why
would
it
be
a
rubber
stamp,
that's
a
witness?
these
are
witnesses
to
facts
and
he
accepts
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
all
information?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
why
didn't
you
have
a
conclusary
statement
in
providing
an
affidavit
to
show
probable
cause?
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
of
that
to
go
out
and
get
evidence
to
support
everything
that's
in

like
it
went
into

justice

how
much?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
one
other
question?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
the
defendant
had
been
put
on
trial
and
the
government
had
put
the
informer
on
the
stand
and
there
had
been
a
challenge
to
his
reliability
and
character,
could
the
government
have
all
put
particular
instances
of
the
past
to
show
that
he
had
been
truthful?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
would
not
be
admissible
because
that's
not
the
way
you
prove
reliability
and
character.
you
prove
it
by
statement
of
somebody
who
knows
you.
this
fellow
said
he
knew
it
and
and
that
he
knew
him
to
be
a
reliable
man.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
would
have
been
sufficient
on
the
trial,
wouldn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
requires
more
that's
your
probable
cause?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
frequently
that's
true
when
you
go
to
approve
character
reputation.
what
you
have
here
is
whether
the
government,
in
order
to
show
probable
cause
when
it
has
somebody
to
testify,
receive
this,
the
man
who
has
a
good
character,
character
being
reliable
whether
it's
necessary
for
the
government
to
go
further
in
a
probable
cause
case
than
it
would
in
a
trial
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
think
that's
right.
justice
hugo

the
basic
issue
is
guilt

innocence,
isn't
it?
that's
what
i
thought
