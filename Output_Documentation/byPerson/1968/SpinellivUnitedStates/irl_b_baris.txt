mr.
irl
b.
baris
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
case
arising
originally
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
missouri
where
the
defendant
petitioner
was
tried
and
convicted
and
sentenced
to
a
term
of
three
years
imprisonment
and
a
fine
for
violation
of
the
so-called
interstate
racketeering
act,
section
1952
of
title
18.
numerous
points
were
raised
upon
appeal
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit
and
there
were
two
hearings
held
in
the
united
states
court
of
appeals.
a
reversal
was
first
obtained
on
a
search
and
seizure
question.
the
government
then
petitioned
for
rehearing,
which
was
granted,
and,
upon
the
rehearing
before
the
court
and
bank,
the
decision
of
the
district
court
was
affirmed.
we
then
applied
petition
in
this
court
for
writ
of
certiorari
which
was
granted
on
march
4
and,
subsequently,
it
was
granted
generally
and,
subsequently
in
may,
that
order
was
limited
to
the
search
and
seizure
question.
the
problems
in
the
area
of
search
and
seizure,
the
fourth
amendment
problem
which
appears
in
this
case,
may
really
be
broken
down
into
three
separate
issues.
number
one,
as
to
the
validity
of
the
search
warrant
insofar
as
there
being
probable
cause
for
its
issuance,
number
two,
with
reference
to
a
time
delay
in
its
execution
and,
number
three,
with
reference
to
items
which
were
seized
upon
the
execution
of
the
search
warrant.
the
affidavit,
in
support
of
the
search
warrant,
was
made
by
a
special
agent
of
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
before
the
united
states
commissioner
and
set
forth
a
number
of
instances
over
a
12-day
period,
during
which
the
petitioner
was
seen
to
be
crossing
and
interstate
bridge
leading
from
the
state
of
illinois
to
the
state
of
missouri.
there
was
also
an
indication
that
the
petitioner
had
a
reputation
among
law
enforcement
agents
as
a
gambler.
there
was
an
indication
in
this
affidavit
concerning
two
telephones
at
a
particular
apartment
which
the
petitioner,
on
these
--
on
some
of
these
12
days,
was
seen
to
enter.
and
finally,
and
this
i
think
is
the
crux
of
the
issue
involving
the
probable
cause,
finally,
the
affidavit
concluded
the
fbi
had
been
informed
by
a
confidential
--
excuse
me,
i
better
say,
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
has
been
informed
by
a
confidential
reliable
informant
that
william
spinelli
is
operating
a
handbook
and
accepting
wagers
and
disseminating
wagering
information
by
means
of
the
telephones
which
have
been
assigned
the
numbers,
and
they
specified
the
same
numbers
which
had
been
indicated
earlier
in
the
affidavit
as
being
at
this
particular
apartment.
it
is
our
belief
that,
primarily,
based
upon
the
aguilar
case,
there
are
no
underlying
circumstances
to
substantiate
the
hearsay
information
which
was
given
to
the
commissioner
in
this
affidavit,
and
that
because
it
was
not
substantiated,
because
there
was
no
underlying
corroboration,
because
there
was
nothing
to
show
the
credibility
of
the
alleged
informant,
that
the
affidavit
was
bad
and,
therefore,
the
search
warrant
was
improperly
issued.
we
believe,
if
the
court
please,
that
--
merely
to
say
that
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
has
received
information,
has
been
informed
by
a
confidential
reliable
informant,
that
the
petitioner
was
engaging
in
a
handbook
operation,
does
not
corroborate
itself
and
that
there
was
nothing
by
virtue
of
the
travel
in
interstate
commerce,
there
was
nothing
by
virtue
of
the
telephones
being
in
the
estab
--
in
the
apartment,
there
was
nothing
by
virtue
of
the
petitioner's
reputation
which
substantiated
that.
mr.
irl
b.
baris
not
insofar
as
there
--
not
being
any
corroboration
for
what
he
said,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
irl
b.
baris
i
don't
think
it
would,
your
honor.
mr.
irl
b.
baris
well
--
mr.
irl
b.
baris
no,
mccray
says
it's
not
necessary.
mr.
irl
b.
baris
i
think
that,
as
indicated
in
the
mccray
case,
there
must
be
an
indication
in
the
affidavit
as
to
why
this
man
is
considered
to
be
a
confidential
and
any
reliable
informant.i
--
mr.
irl
b.
baris
and
which
has
been
shown
to
be
accurate
--
mr.
irl
b.
baris
yes,
i
would
say
that,
under
those
circumstances,
i
would
like
to
see
the
rules
set
forth
that
they
must
say
how
long
this
man
has
been
used
in
his
reliability,
how
long
he
has
been
furnishing
the
information,
but
i
think
that
you're
getting
to
a
situation
which
i
would
recognize
as
being
an
indication
in
the
affidavit
as
to
his
reliability.
mr.
irl
b.
baris
yes,
i
would
say
you're
getting
warm,
mr.
justice
fortas,
and
i
would
not
be
here
arguing
that
point
as
strenuously
as
i
am
if
that
were
in
this
case.
i
think
the
affidavit
would
be
bad
for
other
reason
as
we
have
--
mr.
irl
b.
baris
indicated
in
our
brief.
mr.
irl
b.
baris
well,
i
don't
think
that
there
is
--
mr.
irl
b.
baris
they
would
not
need
anything
else,
i
think,
to
establish
the
reliability
of
the
informant
to
the
credibility
of
the
informant,
but
i
think
that
there
must
be
more
in
an
affidavit
than
merely
saying
that
these
informant
says
that
spinelli
is
operating
a
handbook.i
think
there
must
be
something
--
mr.
irl
b.
baris
i
would
say
--
mr.
irl
b.
baris
i
would
say
your
honor,
yes.
i
would
say
that
the--
mr.
irl
b.
baris
i
would
say
that
it
should
say
that
the
informant
said
that
he
saw
someone
placing
a
bet
with
mr.
spinelli,
that
he
received
information
from
mr.
spinelli
as
to
odds
and
where
he
could
place
a
bet,
that
he
himself
placed
a
bet
with
mr.
spinelli,
or
that
he,
in
some
way,
witnessed
more
than
just
a
conclusion
on
his
part
that
he
is
operating
a
handbook.
we
don't
know
--
mr.
irl
b.
baris
i
think
the
--
mr.
irl
b.
baris
the
aguilar,
if
i'm
pronouncing
that
correctly,
the
aguilar
case
is
authority
for
that,
your
honor.
i--
getting
back
to
the
point
--
mr.
irl
b.
baris
i'm--
mr.
irl
b.
baris
well,
of
course
the
judge
will
make
that
determination,
whether
there's
an
arrest
without
a
warrant,
to
determine
whether
there
was
probable
cause.
the
function
of
the
commissioner
is
to
determine
whether
there
is
probable
cause,
and
i
feel
that
the
affidavit
must
contain
more
than
we
had
here
to
give
the
probable
cause
to
the
commissioner
in
issuing
the
search
warrant.
i
think
that
the
constitution,
of
course,
requires
the
issuance
based
upon
probable
cause
and
there
must
be
an
indication
of
the
probable
cause
to
the
commissioner.
mr.
irl
b.
baris
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
irl
b.
baris
well,
we
have
the
fourth
amendment--
the
right
of
the
people
to
be
secure
in
their
persons,
houses,
papers,
and
effects
against
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures
shall
not
be
violated,
and
no
warrant
shall
issue
but
upon
probable
cause
supported
by
oath
or
affirmation,
and
particularly
describing
the
place
to
be
searched
and
the
persons
or
things
to
be
seized.
mr.
irl
b.
baris
it's
to
be
determined
by
the
commissioner
initially,
your
honor,
but
i
think
that
his
determination
is
subject
to
review
by
the
district
court
and
by
this
court,
of
course.
thank
you.
mr.
irl
b.
baris
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
yesterday
afternoon,
i
was
asked
a
question
i
believe
by
mr.
justice
fortas
and
the
press
of
the
recess
i
did
not
get
a
chance
to
complete
my
question
related
to
the
information
which
i
feel
is
necessary
to
be
included
in
an
affidavit
for
a
search
warrant
and
with
particular
reference
to
the
previous
reliability
of
the
informant.
i
have
here
a
handbook
on
the
law
of
search
and
seizure
to
be
distinguished
of
course
from
the
handbook
about
which
we're
kind
of
talking
in
this
particular
case.
this
is
a
legal
handbook,
i
would
say.
this
was
published
very
recently
by
the
government
and
i
note
that
on
page
four,
for
instance,
these
are
instructions
to
law
enforcement
officers
as
to
what
should
be
included
in
an
affidavit.
and
they
say
specifically
on
page
four,
and
where
the
informant
is
undisclosed,
you
can
back
up
the
other
person's
thrustworthiness
by
showing
prior
dealings
with
him
which
were
reliable
to
backup
your
belief
that
the
information
he
is
now
giving
you
is
reliable.
at
the
end
of
the
book,
there
are
several
examples
of
what
should
be
included
in
affidavits
then
three
of
them,
i
think
are
particularly
noteworthy
because
they
are
--
these
examples
are
based
upon
information
by
a
reliable
informant
and
in
the
first
one
it
says,
informant
has
given
me
reliable
information
on
narcotic
sales
five
times
within
the
last
four
months.
example
number
two
says
informant
has
provided
reliable
information
about
robberies
on
two
occasions
during
the
last
three
months
and
example
number
five
says
a
reliable
informant,
who
has
given
reliable
information
on
narcotics
offenses
on
three
occasions
within
the
last
two
months.
now
i
have
also
would
like
to
draw
the
court's
attention
to
the
various
cases
decided
by
this
court
in
which
there
have
been
information
supplied
by
informants
and
i
think
that
in
each
of
those
cases
where
the
search
warrant
has
been
sustained,
there
is
substantially
more
than
was
included
in
the
affidavit
that
we
have
in
the
instant
case
and
then
those
in
which
the
search
warrant
was
not
sustained,
we
have
a
comparable
situation.
for
example
in
the
mccray
case,
which
was
not
a
search
warrant
case,
but
was
an
arrest
without
a
search
warrant,
one
of
the
officers
testified
in
support
of
his
probable
cause
that
he
had
received
information
from
the
undisclosed
informant
on
15
or
16
occasions
in
the
past
which
resulted
in
numerous
arrests
and
convictions.
a
second
officer
said
that
he
had
received
information
from
his
informant
on
20
to
25
occasions.
in
the
reagan
case,
which
was
a
per
curiam
decision
of
this
court,
involving
a
search
warrant
in
which
the
search
warrant
was
held
to
be
not
good,
it
merely
stated
that
information
from
sources
believed
to
be
reliable
which
i
consider
to
be
very
comparable
to
what
we
have
here
where
they
set
a
confidential,
reliable
informant.
in
the
ventresca
case,
a
search
warrant
case
in
which
the
search
warrant
was
proved,
there
was
no
informant
involved
but
only
government
investigators
and
i
think
the
government
investigators
are
in
a
different
category
from
an
undisclosed
informant.
in
the
beck
case,
not
a
search
warrant
but
in
which
the
arrest
and
the
subsequent
search
was
held
to
be
invalid,
the
officer
had
information
but
there
was
nothing
said
in
his
testimony
concerning
the
credibility
of
the
informant.
in
the
aguilar
case,
the
search
warrant,
the
application
said
reliable
information
from
a
credible
person,
which
i
think
is
practically
what
we
have
in
this
case,
again
the
search
warrant
was
held
to
be
not
good.
in
the
rugendorf
case,
involving
a
search
warrant,
there
were
three
informants
and
as
to
each
of
them
it
says,
whom
the
fbi
had
found
to
be
reliable
or
who
have
furnished
reliable
information
to
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
in
the
past
or
who
had
supplied
the
fbi
with
reliable
information
in
the
past.
in
the
kerr
case,
not
a
search
warrant
case
but
involving
probable
cause
on
arrest,
the
informant
had
previously
given
information
leading
to
at
least
three
arrests.
in
the
jones
case,
the
second
jones
case,
the
362
us,
the
informant
gave
information
on
previous
occasions
which
was
correct.
that
case
was
reversed
on
other
grounds
although
the
search
warrant
was
sustained
in
that
case.
and
in
the
draper
case
which
was
relied
upon
heavily
by
the
majority
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
and
which
is
relied
upon
by
the
government
in
their
brief,
there
was
a
special
employee
of
the
fbi
who
had
been
serving
for
six
months
and
who
gave
the
information
which
was
found
to
be
--
and
had
previously
given
information
which
was
found
to
be
reliable.
upon
the
authority
of
those
cases,
it
is
my
contention
that
merely
to
say
that
the
informant
is
a
reliable,
confidential
informant,
does
not
satisfy
the
requirements
of
the
probable
cause,
requirement
of
the
fourth
amendment.
in
addition
to
the
other
reasons
which
we
have
alleged
and
indicated
in
our
brief,
and
which
we
discussed
yesterday,
i
feel
also
that
the
search
warrant
here
was
improper
because
the
affidavit
did
not
relate
the
time
when
the
alleged
informant
gave
this
information
to
the
government
nor
when
he
allegedly
obtained
this
information.
there
is
a
case
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
of
the
first
circuit,
the
rosencrams
case
cited
in
our
brief,
which
says
that
merely
the
use
of
the
present
tense
is
not
sufficient
for
these
purposes.
mr.
irl
b.
baris
well
your
honor,
there
was
nothing
said
in
the
affidavit
itself
and
of
course,
i
think
the
cases
hold
it
that
one
must,
on
appeal,
govern
it
by
what
is
in
the
affidavit.
it
merely
said
in
the
present
tense
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
has
received
information.
now
at
the
hearing
on
the
motion
to
suppress,
there
was
some
testimony
that
the
information
had
been
given
in
the
early
part
of
august,
it
was
no
more
specific
than
that.
the
search
warrant
was
applied
for
on
the
18th
of
august
and
was
executed
on
that
date.
we
have
also
indicated
two
other
points
in
our
brief,
one
with
reference
to
the
fact
that
more
items
were
seized
than
the
search
warrant
required.
the
court
of
appeals
seemed
to
justify
the
seizure
of
a
pencil-sharp
narrow
radio
and
adding
machine,
watch,
eyeglasses,
all
under
the
general
heading
of
gambling
paraphernalia.
we
feel
that
to
allow
any
seizure
on
the
ground
of
gambling
paraphernalia
makes
it
a
general
warrant
and
is
improper.
in
fact,
we
were
in
the
anomalous
situation
that
they
seized—the
search
warrant
provided
for
the
seizure
of
two
telephones,
they
seized
five
and
i
suppose
the
government's
contention
is
the
two
telephones
are
two
telephones
but
the
other
three
telephones
were
not
telephones
but
gambling
paraphernalia.
now
with
reference
to
a
final
point
that
we
have
brought
up
in
our
brief,
and
that
is
with
reference
to
the
execution
of
the
search
warrant.
the
facts
in
this
case
are
that
immediately
after
the
agents
received
the
search
warrant,
they
apparently
went
back
to
their
office
for
certain
mechanical
equipments
and
walkie-talkies
apparently
and
then
went
out
to
the
scene
of
the
search.
but
instead
of
breaking
into
the
premises
or
obtaining
entrance
into
the
premises,
they
went
to
an
apartment
next
door
and
waited
from
4:55
in
the
afternoon
until
7:05
in
the
afternoon,
a
period
of
two
hours
and
10
minutes.
they
--
so
far
as
the
record
shows,
did
nothing
during
that
period
of
time
except
to
wait
and
when
the
petitioner
exited
from
the
subject
apartment,
they
then
came
out
of
the
apartment
next
door
and
--
which
was
right
across
the
hall
in
fact,
and
immediately
placed
the
petitioner
under
arrest
and
then,
by
virtue
of
a
key,
was
they
obtained
from
his
possession,
went
into
the
subject
premises.
it
is
our
belief
that
this
is
not
forth
with
execution
of
a
search
warrant
as
is
required
by
rule
4
that
forthwith
means,
under
these
circumstances,
immediately.
we
believe
that
of
course
there
is
the
provision
in
rule
4
that
a
search
warrant
must
be
executed
within
a
period
of
10
days
after
it's
issued,
otherwise
is
it
loses
its
validity.
but
our
position
is
that
where
the
officers
have
the
search
warrant,
were
at
the
premises,
had
everything
available
to
them
for
getting
into
the
premises
including
the
right
under
section
3109
to
break
the
doors,
that
they
should
have
executed
it
forthwith.
now
the
court
of
appeals
decision
has
indicated
that
it
was
incumbent
upon
petitioner
to
show
some
prejudice
resulting
from
this
delay.
we
have
found
no
case
which
directly
is
in
point
with
this
particular
proposition,
except
as
mentioned
in
the
concurring
opinion
of
judge
bazelon
in
the
mitchell
case
which
we
have
cited
in
our
brief.
but
it
is
our
position
--
mr.
irl
b.
baris
your
honor,
i
don't
know
that
they
have
not
attempted
to
justify
it
on
that
basis
throughout
this
case,
i
think
that
perhaps
they
were
giving
themselves
an
opportunity
to
do
so
if
the
government
decided
to
do
that
on
the
basis
that
the
search
warrant
would
be
held
invalid.
perhaps,
i'm
merely
speculating
as
to
the
government's
position.
perhaps,
they're
giving
themselves
an
ace
in
the
hole,
so
to
speak,
that
if
the
search
warrant
were
declared
to
be
invalid,
then
they
would
have,
as
an
alternative
the
question
of
an
arrest
and
a
search
incidental
to
the
arrest.
mr.
irl
b.
baris
yes
they
did
make
a
return
on
the
warrant.
it
is
our
position
therefore
that
the
search
was
not
executed
forthwith
and
that
the
burden
is
not
upon
the
petitioner
to
show
prejudice
because
the
burden
is
not
on
the
position
to
show
prejudice,
in
an
instance
where,
for
instance
under
the
marin
case,
i
believe
it
is
that
in
which
--
no
the
wong
tai
case,
in
which,
under
section
3109,
where
the
defendant
was
not
required
to
show
prejudice
because
the
officers
fail
to
identify
themselves
before
making
the
entry
into
the
premises.
i
have
reserved
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal
if
the
court
please?
mr.
irl
b.
baris
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
say
first
of
all,
with
reference
to
the
question
posed
by
mr.
justice
black
concerning
the
commissioner's
acceptance
of
the
affidavit
as
being
sufficient.
i
believed
that
if
the
commissioner
merely
accepts
what
the
affidavit
says,
then
he
is
becoming
as
was
indicated
to
use
a
language
of
the
aguilar
case
a
rubber
stamp
for
the
police.
i
think
the
commissioner
must
--
mr.
irl
b.
baris
he
is
basing
it
upon
a
hearsay
statement.
mr.
irl
b.
baris
the
information
which
came
from
the
informant
was
hearsay,
mr.
justice
black,
and
the
question
about
the
reliability
was
merely
a
conclusary
statement
that
he
is
a
reliable
informant.
mr.
irl
b.
baris
i
read
the
--
mr.
irl
b.
baris
well
i
read
the
aguilar
case
is
saying
that
there
must
be
some
underlying
circumstances
to
show
the
reliability
of
the
informant.
mr.
irl
b.
baris
i
think
that
an
indication
is
in
the
handy
guide
of
the
government
that
the
informant
has
given
previous
information
on
three
occasions
over
the
past
two
months
would
be
satisfactory.
mr.
irl
b.
baris
i
think
that
under
those
circumstances
it
would
be
all
right,
mr.
justice
white.
i
cannot
draw
a
line
of
distinction
and
i'm
sure
this
court
--
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
irl
b.
baris
that's
right.
it
was
just
the
conclusion
on
the
part
of
the
affiant
that
he
was
a
reliable
informant.
he
did
not
say
on
what
he
based
this
question
of
reliability
and
i
think
that
there
must
be
some
indication
as
was
indicated
in
the
mccray
case
where
they
justified
probable
cause
by
a
number
of
arrests.
mr.
irl
b.
baris
in
draper,
with
reference
to
reliability,
the
individual
was
an
employee
of
the
government
who
had
been
supplying
reliable
information
over
a
period
of
six
months
and
on
that
basis,
the
court
has
held
him,
i
will
recognize
the
propriety
of
that
decision
and
that
respect
that
he
was
a
reliable
informant.
but
the
background
of
the
informant
was
included
in
the
information
that
was
given
here,
it
was
not
included
in
the
information
given
to
the
commissioner.
mr.
irl
b.
baris
with
reference
to
the
question
of
reliability,
i
would
think
that
that
affidavit
would
be
sustained
by
the
cases
that
we
have.
mr.
irl
b.
baris
i
would
say
that
there
must
be
more
to
corroborate
what
the
informant
said.
i've
been
discussing
with
you,
if
you
please,
your
honor,
the
question
of
the
reliability
of
the
informant
himself.
now
i
believe,
contrary
to
what
mr.
connoly
said,
as
far
as
my
position
is
concerned,
i
think
that
aguilar
says
more
than
just,
there
must
be
a
substantiation
of
the
reliability
of
the
informant.
i
think
there
must,
in
addition
be
substantiation
of
the
reliability
of
his
information.
i
think
that
that's
the
second
thrust
of
the
aguilar
case
and
in
the
hypothesis
that
you
posed,
that
there
was
nothing
indicating
the
corroboration
of
what
he
said.
and
i
fee
l
also
that
there
was
nothing
to
corroborate
the
conclusion
on
the
part
of
the
informant
in
this
particular
instance
that
a
handbook
was
being
operated
and
i
don't
think
that
the
surveillance,
mr.
justice
fortas
as
sufficient.
mr.
irl
b.
baris
well,
if
your
honor
please
in
--
mr.
irl
b.
baris
yes
i
do
your
honor,
not
just
because
i
am
an
advocate
in
this
position
but
i
do
feel
it
for
this
reason
that
there
is
absolutely,
in
this
affidavit
as
i
read
it,
no
corroboration
whatsoever
about
the
ultimate
conclusion
of
the
informant
that
a
handbook
was
being
operated.
now
bear
in
mind
that
in
aguilar,
what
we
have
is
an
allegation
by
an
informant
of
the
commission
of
a
federal
offense,
to
with
the
possession
of
narcotics.
here,
the
only
thing
that
the
informant
said
is
an
allegation
of
the
commission
of
a
state
offense,
the
operation
of
a
handbook.
there
are
other
elements
to
the
federal
offense
that
is
the
traveling.
the
surveillance
was
not
corroborative
of
anything
that
the
informant
said.
now,
getting
back
to
footnote
1
of
aguilar,
if
the
surveillance
were
to
include
indications
that
the
petitioner
had
been
followed
and
he
stopped
and
he
met
a
different
people
and
money
was
seen
to
be
exchanged
and
notes
were
seen
to
be
made
and
other
information
was
dispensed,
then
that
surveillance
would
be
corroborative
of
the
federal
offense.
but
i
looked
at
the
surveillance
indicated
in
this
affidavit
as
attempting
to
supply
one
element
of
a
federal
offense,
the
interstate
travel.
the
informant's
information
--
mr.
irl
b.
baris
they
said
there
were
no
carpets
in
the
apartment.
mr.
irl
b.
baris
well
i
compare
aguilar
with
this
case
on
the
basis
of
the
meet
of
the
informant's
information.
the
informant
in
aguilar
and
the
informant
here
was
the
only
indication
of
any
illegal
conduct
on
the
part
of
the
defendant
in
each
of
those
cases.
i
would
say
that
the
other
information
about
his
travels
is
certainly
not
illegal,
unless
it's
combined
with
other
illegal
conduct.
but,
we
have
a
situation
where
what
the
informant
said
was
merely
a
state
violation
and
did
not
supply
all
the
elements
of
the
alleged
federal
offense.
the
other
elements
of
the
alleged
federal
offense
came
in
from
the
surveillance
showing
his
interstate
travel.
but
there
was
nothing
to
tie
those
two
in
as
part
of
a
federal
offense
and
nothing
to
tie
to
corroborate
the
surveillance
on
the
one
hand
and
the
informant's
information
on
the
other
hand.
they
were
completely
disjointed.
mr.
irl
b.
baris
yes
i
will
agree
with
you,
your
honor
on
that.
mr.
irl
b.
baris
yes
i
will.
as
i
said
before,
as
an
advocate
i
must
take
a
strong
position
but
i
will
agree
that
this
case
does
involve
an
extension
perhaps
of
the
aguilar
rule
but
in
my
view,
based
upon
aguilar
and
the
other
cases,
this
is
a
logical
extension
of
the
rule
of
the
aguilar
case.
mr.
irl
b.
baris
yes
your
honor.
mr.
irl
b.
baris
i
would
think
that
on
the
question
of
admissibility
of
such
evidence
at
the
trial,
it
would
not
be
admissible.
mr.
irl
b.
baris
of
course
--
mr.
irl
b.
baris
at
the
trial,
if
that
became
an
issue,
yes
sir.
mr.
irl
b.
baris
well,
in
this
instance
i
might
point
out
that
the
man
who
made
the
affidavit
had
not
had
any
contact
with
his
alleged
reliable
informant.
his
contact
was
with
another
agent
who
in
turn
communicated
--
mr.
irl
b.
baris
i
believe
the
government
is
under
that
requirement
your
honor
because
i
think
--
mr.
irl
b.
baris
i
think
on
the
issue
of
probable
cause,
there
is
a
more
basic
issue
than
what
appears
at
the
trial.
there
is
a
more
basic
issue
--
mr.
irl
b.
baris
at
the
trial
it
is,
your
honor,
but
i
think
that
in
the
commissioner
states,
the
basic
issue
is
one
of
probable
cause.
mr.
irl
b.
baris
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
case
arising
originally
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
missouri
where
the
defendant
petitioner
was
tried
and
convicted
and
sentenced
to
a
term
of
three
years
imprisonment
and
a
fine
for
violation
of
the
so-called
interstate
racketeering
act,
section
1952
of
title
18.
numerous
points
were
raised
upon
appeal
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit
and
there
were
two
hearings
held
in
the
united
states
court
of
appeals.
a
reversal
was
first
obtained
on
a
search
and
seizure
question.
the
government
then
petitioned
for
rehearing,
which
was
granted,
and,
upon
the
rehearing
before
the
court
and
bank,
the
decision
of
the
district
court
was
affirmed.
we
then
applied
petition
in
this
court
for
writ
of
certiorari
which
was
granted
on
march
4
and,
subsequently,
it
was
granted
generally
and,
subsequently
in
may,
that
order
was
limited
to
the
search
and
seizure
question.
the
problems
in
the
area
of
search
and
seizure,
the
fourth
amendment
problem
which
appears
in
this
case,
may
really
be
broken
down
into
three
separate
issues.
number
one,
as
to
the
validity
of
the
search
warrant
insofar
as
there
being
probable
cause
for
its
issuance,
number
two,
with
reference
to
a
time
delay
in
its
execution
and,
number
three,
with
reference
to
items
which
were
seized
upon
the
execution
of
the
search
warrant.
the
affidavit,
in
support
of
the
search
warrant,
was
made
by
a
special
agent
of
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
before
the
united
states
commissioner
and
set
forth
a
number
of
instances
over
a
12-day
period,
during
which
the
petitioner
was
seen
to
be
crossing
and
interstate
bridge
leading
from
the
state
of
illinois
to
the
state
of
missouri.
there
was
also
an
indication
that
the
petitioner
had
a
reputation
among
law
enforcement
agents
as
a
gambler.
there
was
an
indication
in
this
affidavit
concerning
two
telephones
at
a
particular
apartment
which
the
petitioner,
on
these
--
on
some
of
these
12
days,
was
seen
to
enter.
and
finally,
and
this
i
think
is
the
crux
of
the
issue
involving
the
probable
cause,
finally,
the
affidavit
concluded
the
fbi
had
been
informed
by
a
confidential
--
excuse
me,
i
better
say,
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
has
been
informed
by
a
confidential
reliable
informant
that
william
spinelli
is
operating
a
handbook
and
accepting
wagers
and
disseminating
wagering
information
by
means
of
the
telephones
which
have
been
assigned
the
numbers,
and
they
specified
the
same
numbers
which
had
been
indicated
earlier
in
the
affidavit
as
being
at
this
particular
apartment.
it
is
our
belief
that,
primarily,
based
upon
the
aguilar
case,
there
are
no
underlying
circumstances
to
substantiate
the
hearsay
information
which
was
given
to
the
commissioner
in
this
affidavit,
and
that
because
it
was
not
substantiated,
because
there
was
no
underlying
corroboration,
because
there
was
nothing
to
show
the
credibility
of
the
alleged
informant,
that
the
affidavit
was
bad
and,
therefore,
the
search
warrant
was
improperly
issued.
we
believe,
if
the
court
please,
that
--
merely
to
say
that
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
has
received
information,
has
been
informed
by
a
confidential
reliable
informant,
that
the
petitioner
was
engaging
in
a
handbook
operation,
does
not
corroborate
itself
and
that
there
was
nothing
by
virtue
of
the
travel
in
interstate
commerce,
there
was
nothing
by
virtue
of
the
telephones
being
in
the
estab
--
in
the
apartment,
there
was
nothing
by
virtue
of
the
petitioner's
reputation
which
substantiated
that.
mr.

as

corroboration

not

mr.

i
think
that,
as
indicated
in
the
mccray
case,
there
must
be
an
indication
in
the

as
to
why
this
man
is
considered
to
be
a
confidential
and
any
reliable
informant.i

which
has
been
shown
to
be
accurate

mr.

that,
under
those
circumstances,
i
would
like
to
see
the
rules
set
forth
that
they
must
say
how
long
this
man
has
been
used
in
his
reliability,
how
long
he
has
been
furnishing
the
information,
but
i
think
that
you're
getting
to
a
situation
which
i
would
recognize
as
being
an
indication
in
the
affidavit
as
to
his
reliability.
mr.
irl
b.
baris
yes,
i
would
say
you're
getting
warm,
mr.

fortas,
and
i
would
not
be
here
arguing
that
point
as
strenuously
as
i
am
if
that
were
in
this
case.
i
think
the
affidavit
would
be
bad
for
other
reason
as
we
have
--

indicated
in
our
brief.

would

anything
else,
i
think,
to
establish
the
reliability
of
the
informant

the
credibility
of

informant,
but
i
think
that
there
must
be
more
in
an
affidavit
than
merely
saying
that

would

said

he
saw
someone
placing
a
bet
with
mr.
spinelli,
that
he
received
information
from
mr.
spinelli
as
to
odds
and
where
he
could
place
a

that
he
himself
placed
a

or
that
he,
in
some
way,

is
to
determine
whether
there
is
probable
cause,
and
i
feel
that
the
affidavit
must
contain
more
than
we
had
here
to
give
the
probable
cause
to
the
commissioner
in
issuing
the
search
warrant.
i
think
that
the
constitution,
of
course,
requires
the
issuance
based
upon
probable
cause
and
there
must
be
an
indication
of
the
probable
cause
to
the
commissioner.
mr.
irl
b.
baris
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
irl
b.
baris
well,
we
have
the
fourth
amendment--
the
right
of
the
people
to
be
secure
in
their
persons,
houses,
papers,
and
effects
against
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures
shall
not
be
violated,
and
no
warrant
shall
issue
but
upon
probable
cause
supported
by
oath
or
affirmation,
and
particularly
describing
the
place
to
be
searched
and
the
persons
or
things
to
be
seized.
mr.
irl
b.
baris
it's
to
be
determined
by
the
commissioner
initially,
your
honor,
but
i
think
that
his
determination
is
subject
to
review
by
the
district
court
and
by
this
court,
of
course.
thank
you.
mr.
irl
b.
baris
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
yesterday
afternoon,
i
was
asked
a
question
i
believe
by
mr.
justice
fortas
and
the
press
of
the
recess
i
did
not
get
a
chance
to
complete
my
question
related
to
the
information
which
i
feel
is
necessary
to
be
included
in
an
affidavit
for
a
search
warrant
and
with
particular
reference
to
the
previous
reliability
of
the
informant.
i
have
here
a
handbook
on
the
law
of
search
and
seizure
to
be
distinguished
of
course
from
the
handbook
about
which
we're
kind
of
talking
in
this
particular
case.
this
is
a
legal
handbook,
i
would
say.
this
was
published
very
recently
by
the
government
and
i
note
that
on
page
four,
for
instance,
these
are
instructions
to
law
enforcement
officers
as
to
what
should
be
included
in
an
affidavit.
and
they
say
specifically
on
page
four,
and
where
the
informant
is
undisclosed,
you
can
back
up
the
other
person's
thrustworthiness
by
showing
prior
dealings
with
him
which
were
reliable
to
backup
your
belief
that
the
information
he
is
now
giving
you
is
reliable.
at
the
end
of
the
book,
there
are
several
examples
of
what
should
be
included
in
affidavits
then
three
of
them,
i
think
are
particularly
noteworthy
because
they
are
--
these
examples
are
based
upon
information
by
a
reliable
informant
and
in
the
first
one
it
says,
informant
has
given
me
reliable
information
on
narcotic
sales
five
times
within
the
last
four
months.
example
number
two
says
informant
has
provided
reliable
information
about
robberies
on
two
occasions
during
the
last
three
months
and
example
number
five
says
a
reliable
informant,
who
has
given
reliable
information
on
narcotics
offenses
on
three
occasions
within
the
last
two
months.
now
i
have
also
would
like
to
draw
the
court's
attention
to
the
various
cases
decided
by
this
court
in
which
there
have
been
information
supplied
by
informants
and
i
think
that
in
each
of
those
cases
where
the
search
warrant
has
been
sustained,
there
is
substantially
more
than
was
included
in
the
affidavit
that
we
have
in
the
instant
case
and
then
those
in
which
the
search
warrant
was
not
sustained,
we
have
a
comparable
situation.
for
example
in
the
mccray
case,
which
was
not
a
search
warrant
case,
but
was
an
arrest
without
a
search
warrant,
one
of
the
officers
testified
in
support
of
his
probable
cause
that
he
had
received
information
from
the
undisclosed
informant
on
15
or
16
occasions
in
the
past
which
resulted
in
numerous
arrests
and
convictions.
a
second
officer
said
that
he
had
received
information
from
his
informant
on
20
to
25
occasions.
in
the
reagan
case,
which
was
a
per
curiam
decision
of
this
court,
involving
a
search
warrant
in
which
the
search
warrant
was
held
to
be
not
good,
it
merely
stated
that
information
from
sources
believed
to
be
reliable
which
i
consider
to
be
very
comparable
to
what
we
have
here
where
they
set
a
confidential,
reliable
informant.
in
the
ventresca
case,
a
search
warrant
case
in
which
the
search
warrant
was
proved,
there
was
no
informant
involved
but
only
government
investigators
and
i
think
the
government
investigators
are
in
a
different
category
from
an
undisclosed
informant.
in
the
beck
case,
not
a
search
warrant
but
in
which
the
arrest
and
the
subsequent
search
was
held
to
be
invalid,
the
officer
had
information
but
there
was
nothing
said
in
his
testimony
concerning
the
credibility
of
the
informant.
in
the
aguilar
case,
the
search
warrant,
the
application
said
reliable
information
from
a
credible
person,
which
i
think
is
practically
what
we
have
in
this
case,
again
the
search
warrant
was
held
to
be
not
good.
in
the
rugendorf
case,
involving
a
search
warrant,
there
were
three
informants
and
as
to
each
of
them
it
says,
whom
the
fbi
had
found
to
be
reliable
or
who
have
furnished
reliable
information
to
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
in
the
past
or
who
had
supplied
the
fbi
with
reliable
information
in
the
past.
in
the
kerr
case,
not
a
search
warrant
case
but
involving
probable
cause
on
arrest,
the
informant
had
previously
given
information
leading
to
at
least
three
arrests.
in
the
jones
case,
the
second
jones
case,
the
362
us,
the
informant
gave
information
on
previous
occasions
which
was
correct.
that
case
was
reversed
on
other
grounds
although
the
search
warrant
was
sustained
in
that
case.
and
in
the
draper
case
which
was
relied
upon
heavily
by
the
majority
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
and
which
is
relied
upon
by
the
government
in
their
brief,
there
was
a
special
employee
of
the
fbi
who
had
been
serving
for
six
months
and
who
gave
the
information
which
was
found
to
be
--
and
had
previously
given
information
which
was
found
to
be
reliable.
upon
the
authority
of
those
cases,
it
is
my
contention
that
merely
to
say
that
the
informant
is
a
reliable,
confidential
informant,
does
not
satisfy
the
requirements
of
the
probable
cause,
requirement
of
the
fourth
amendment.
in
addition
to
the
other
reasons
which
we
have
alleged
and
indicated
in
our
brief,
and
which
we
discussed
yesterday,
i
feel
also
that
the
search
warrant
here
was
improper
because
the
affidavit
did
not
relate
the
time
when
the
alleged
informant
gave
this
information
to
the
government
nor
when
he
allegedly
obtained
this
information.
there
is
a
case
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
of
the
first
circuit,
the
rosencrams
case
cited
in
our
brief,
which
says
that
merely
the
use
of
the
present
tense
is
not
sufficient
for
these
purposes.
mr.
irl
b.
baris
well
your
honor,
there
was
nothing
said
in
the
affidavit
itself
and
of
course,
i
think
the
cases
hold
it
that
one
must,
on
appeal,
govern
it
by
what
is
in
the
affidavit.
it
merely
said
in
the
present
tense
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
has
received
information.
now
at
the
hearing
on
the
motion
to
suppress,
there
was
some
testimony
that
the
information
had
been
given
in
the
early
part
of
august,
it
was
no
more
specific
than
that.
the
search
warrant
was
applied
for
on
the
18th
of
august
and
was
executed
on
that
date.
we
have
also
indicated
two
other
points
in
our
brief,
one
with
reference
to
the
fact
that
more
items
were
seized
than
the
search
warrant
required.
the
court
of
appeals
seemed
to
justify
the
seizure
of
a
pencil-sharp
narrow
radio
and
adding
machine,
watch,
eyeglasses,
all
under
the
general
heading
of
gambling
paraphernalia.
we
feel
that
to
allow
any
seizure
on
the
ground
of
gambling
paraphernalia
makes
it
a
general
warrant
and
is
improper.
in
fact,
we
were
in
the
anomalous
situation
that
they
seized—the
search
warrant
provided
for
the
seizure
of
two
telephones,
they
seized
five
and
i
suppose
the
government's
contention
is
the
two
telephones
are
two
telephones
but
the
other
three
telephones
were
not
telephones
but
gambling
paraphernalia.
now
with
reference
to
a
final
point
that
we
have
brought
up
in
our
brief,
and
that
is
with
reference
to
the
execution
of
the
search
warrant.
the
facts
in
this
case
are
that
immediately
after
the
agents
received
the
search
warrant,
they
apparently
went
back
to
their
office
for
certain
mechanical
equipments
and
walkie-talkies
apparently
and
then
went
out
to
the
scene
of
the
search.
but
instead
of
breaking
into
the
premises
or
obtaining
entrance
into
the
premises,
they
went
to
an
apartment
next
door
and
waited
from
4:55
in
the
afternoon
until
7:05
in
the
afternoon,
a
period
of
two
hours
and
10
minutes.
they
--
so
far
as
the
record
shows,
did
nothing
during
that
period
of
time
except
to
wait
and
when
the
petitioner
exited
from
the
subject
apartment,
they
then
came
out
of
the
apartment
next
door
and
--
which
was
right
across
the
hall
in
fact,
and
immediately
placed
the
petitioner
under
arrest
and
then,
by
virtue
of
a
key,
was
they
obtained
from
his
possession,
went
into
the
subject
premises.
it
is
our
belief
that
this
is
not
forth
with
execution
of
a
search
warrant
as
is
required
by
rule
4
that
forthwith
means,
under
these
circumstances,
immediately.
we
believe
that
of
course
there
is
the
provision
in
rule
4
that
a
search
warrant
must
be
executed
within
a
period
of
10
days
after
it's
issued,
otherwise
is
it
loses
its
validity.
but
our
position
is
that
where
the
officers
have
the
search
warrant,
were
at
the
premises,
had
everything
available
to
them
for
getting
into
the
premises
including
the
right
under
section
3109
to
break
the
doors,
that
they
should
have
executed
it
forthwith.
now
the
court
of
appeals
decision
has
indicated
that
it
was
incumbent
upon
petitioner
to
show
some
prejudice
resulting
from
this
delay.
we
have
found
no
case
which
directly
is
in
point
with
this
particular
proposition,
except
as
mentioned
in
the
concurring
opinion
of
judge
bazelon
in
the
mitchell
case
which
we
have
cited
in
our
brief.
but
it
is
our
position
--
mr.
irl
b.
baris
your
honor,
i
don't
know
that
they
have
not
attempted
to
justify
it
on
that
basis
throughout
this
case,
i
think
that
perhaps
they
were
giving
themselves
an
opportunity
to
do
so
if
the
government
decided
to
do
that
on
the
basis
that
the
search
warrant
would
be
held
invalid.
perhaps,
i'm
merely
speculating
as
to
the
government's
position.
perhaps,
they're
giving
themselves
an
ace
in
the
hole,
so
to
speak,
that
if
the
search
warrant
were
declared
to
be
invalid,
then
they
would
have,
as
an
alternative
the
question
of
an
arrest
and
a
search
incidental
to
the
arrest.
mr.
irl
b.
baris
yes
they
did
make
a
return
on
the
warrant.
it
is
our
position
therefore
that
the
search
was
not
executed
forthwith
and
that
the
burden
is
not
upon
the
petitioner
to
show
prejudice
because
the
burden
is
not
on
the
position
to
show
prejudice,
in
an
instance
where,
for
instance
under
the
marin
case,
i
believe
it
is
that
in
which
--
no
the
wong
tai
case,
in
which,
under
section
3109,
where
the
defendant
was
not
required
to
show
prejudice
because
the
officers
fail
to
identify
themselves
before
making
the
entry
into
the
premises.
i
have
reserved
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal
if
the
court
please?
mr.
irl
b.
baris
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
say
first
of
all,
with
reference
to
the
question
posed
by
mr.
justice
black
concerning
the
commissioner's
acceptance
of
the
affidavit
as
being
sufficient.
i
believed
that
if
the
commissioner
merely
accepts
what
the
affidavit
says,
then
he
is
becoming
as
was
indicated
to
use
a
language
of
the
aguilar
case
a
rubber
stamp
for
the
police.
i
think
the
commissioner
must
--
mr.
irl
b.
baris
he
is
basing
it
upon
a
hearsay
statement.
mr.
irl
b.
baris
the
information
which
came
from
the
informant
was
hearsay,
mr.
justice
black,
and
the
question
about
the
reliability
was
merely
a
conclusary
statement
that
he
is
a
reliable
informant.
mr.
irl
b.
baris
i
read
the
--
mr.
irl
b.
baris
well
i
read
the
aguilar
case
is
saying
that
there
must
be
some
underlying
circumstances
to
show
the
reliability
of
the
informant.
mr.
irl
b.
baris
i
think
that
an
indication
is
in
the
handy
guide
of
the
government
that
the
informant
has
given
previous
information
on
three
occasions
over
the
past
two
months
would
be
satisfactory.
mr.
irl
b.
baris
i
think
that
under
those
circumstances
it
would
be
all
right,
mr.
justice
white.
i
cannot
draw
a
line
of
distinction
and
i'm
sure
this
court
--
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
irl
b.
baris
that's
right.
it
was
just
the
conclusion
on
the
part
of
the
affiant
that
he
was
a
reliable
informant.
he
did
not
say
on
what
he
based
this
question
of
reliability
and
i
think
that
there
must
be
some
indication
as
was
indicated
in
the
mccray
case
where
they
justified
probable
cause
by
a
number
of
arrests.
mr.
irl
b.
baris
in
draper,
with
reference
to
reliability,
the
individual
was
an
employee
of
the
government
who
had
been
supplying
reliable
information
over
a
period
of
six
months
and
on
that
basis,
the
court
has
held
him,
i
will
recognize
the
propriety
of
that
decision
and
that
respect
that
he
was
a
reliable
informant.
but
the
background
of
the
informant
was
included
in
the
information
that
was
given
here,
it
was
not
included
in
the
information
given
to
the
commissioner.
mr.
irl
b.
baris
with
reference
to
the
question
of
reliability,
i
would
think
that
that
affidavit
would
be
sustained
by
the
cases
that
we
have.
mr.
irl
b.
baris
i
would
say
that
there
must
be
more
to
corroborate
what
the
informant
said.
i've
been
discussing
with
you,
if
you
please,
your
honor,
the
question
of
the
reliability
of
the
informant
himself.
now
i
believe,
contrary
to
what
mr.
connoly
said,
as
far
as
my
position
is
concerned,
i
think
that
aguilar
says
more
than
just,
there
must
be
a
substantiation
of
the
reliability
of
the
informant.
i
think
there
must,
in
addition
be
substantiation
of
the
reliability
of
his
information.
i
think
that
that's
the
second
thrust
of
the
aguilar
case
and
in
the
hypothesis
that
you
posed,
that
there
was
nothing
indicating
the
corroboration
of
what
he
said.
and
i
fee
l
also
that
there
was
nothing
to
corroborate
the
conclusion
on
the
part
of
the
informant
in
this
particular
instance
that
a
handbook
was
being
operated
and
i
don't
think
that
the
surveillance,
mr.
justice
fortas
as
sufficient.
mr.
irl
b.
baris
well,
if
your
honor
please
in
--
mr.
irl
b.
baris
yes
i
do
your
honor,
not
just
because
i
am
an
advocate
in
this
position
but
i
do
feel
it
for
this
reason
that
there
is
absolutely,
in
this
affidavit
as
i
read
it,
no
corroboration
whatsoever
about
the
ultimate
conclusion
of
the
informant
that
a
handbook
was
being
operated.
now
bear
in
mind
that
in
aguilar,
what
we
have
is
an
allegation
by
an
informant
of
the
commission
of
a
federal
offense,
to
with
the
possession
of
narcotics.
here,
the
only
thing
that
the
informant
said
is
an
allegation
of
the
commission
of
a
state
offense,
the
operation
of
a
handbook.
there
are
other
elements
to
the
federal
offense
that
is
the
traveling.
the
surveillance
was
not
corroborative
of
anything
that
the
informant
said.
now,
getting
back
to
footnote
1
of
aguilar,
if
the
surveillance
were
to
include
indications
that
the
petitioner
had
been
followed
and
he
stopped
and
he
met
a
different
people
and
money
was
seen
to
be
exchanged
and
notes
were
seen
to
be
made
and
other
information
was
dispensed,
then
that
surveillance
would
be
corroborative
of
the
federal
offense.
but
i
looked
at
the
surveillance
indicated
in
this
affidavit
as
attempting
to
supply
one
element
of
a
federal
offense,
the
interstate
travel.
the
informant's
information
--
mr.
irl
b.
baris
they
said
there
were
no
carpets
in
the
apartment.
mr.
irl
b.
baris
well
i
compare
aguilar
with
this
case
on
the
basis
of
the
meet
of
the
informant's
information.
the
informant
in
aguilar
and
the
informant
here
was
the
only
indication
of
any
illegal
conduct
on
the
part
of
the
defendant
in
each
of
those
cases.
i
would
say
that
the
other
information
about
his
travels
is
certainly
not
illegal,
unless
it's
combined
with
other
illegal
conduct.
but,
we
have
a
situation
where
what
the
informant
said
was
merely
a
state
violation
and
did
not
supply
all
the
elements
of
the
alleged
federal
offense.
the
other
elements
of
the
alleged
federal
offense
came
in
from
the
surveillance
showing
his
interstate
travel.
but
there
was
nothing
to
tie
those
two
in
as
part
of
a
federal
offense
and
nothing
to
tie
to
corroborate
the
surveillance
on
the
one
hand
and
the
informant's
information
on
the
other
hand.
they
were
completely
disjointed.
mr.
irl
b.
baris
yes
i
will
agree
with
you,
your
honor
on
that.
mr.
irl
b.
baris
yes
i
will.
as
i
said
before,
as
an
advocate
i
must
take
a
strong
position
but
i
will
agree
that
this
case
does
involve
an
extension
perhaps
of
the
aguilar
rule
but
in
my
view,
based
upon
aguilar
and
the
other
cases,
this
is
a
logical
extension
of
the
rule
of
the
aguilar
case.
mr.
irl
b.
baris
yes
your
honor.
mr.
irl
b.
baris
i
would
think
that
on
the
question
of
admissibility
of
such
evidence
at
the
trial,
it
would
not
be
admissible.
mr.
irl
b.
baris
of
course
--
mr.
irl
b.
baris
at
the
trial,
if
that
became
an
issue,
yes
sir.
mr.
irl
b.
baris
well,
in
this
instance
i
might
point
out
that
the
man
who
made
the
affidavit
had
not
had
any
contact
with
his
alleged
reliable
informant.
his
contact
was
with
another
agent
who
in
turn
communicated
--
mr.
irl
b.
baris
i
believe
the
government
is
under
that
requirement
your
honor
because
i
think
--
mr.
irl
b.
baris
i
think
on
the
issue
of
probable
cause,
there
is
a
more
basic
issue
than
what
appears
at
the
trial.
there
is
a
more
basic
issue
--
mr.
irl
b.
baris
at
the
trial
it
is,
your
honor,
but
i
think
that
in
the
commissioner
states,
the
basic
issue
is
one
of
probable
cause.
