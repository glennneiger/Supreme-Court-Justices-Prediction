you

what
was
the
lapse
of

here
in

case?

mr.

chief

what

it
about

and
zapping
in
another
place
on
the
way
of
fact
a
man
going
to
his

what
is
there
of
an
incriminating
nature
in
that?
chief

well
his

there
--

what
is
there
incriminating
about
that?
chief

was
there
anything
incriminating
about
having
two
telephones
in
an

chief
justice
earl
warren
well
then
don't
you
go
back
then
to
just
this
simple
fact,
it
is
alleged
that
a
confidential
informant
have
told
the
affiant
that
this
man
was
operating
a
book
there.
don't
you
get
back
to
that?
these
other
things
in
and
of
themselves
not
being
incriminating,
do
you
not
get
back
to
that
one
fact
to
support
your
affidavit.
chief
justice

in
what
sense
is
that
different
from
your
allegation?
chief

earl
warren
to

effect?
chief

do
you
feel
that
it
would
be
a
burden
on
the
government
to
require
them
to
put
something
in
their
affidavit
as
to
the
reason
for
the
belief
that
this
was
a
confidential
employee.

chief
justice
earl
warren
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
government,
according
to
that
article
that
counsel
read,
actually
tells
each
people
to
do
that,
doesn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
don't
you
stay
with
it,
it
says
that
they
do
it?
chief

he
talks
about
the

there,
he's
talking
about

what
they
are

chief

couldn't
he
say
that
he's
a
businessman
in
the
community
who
has
good
reputation
and
a
resident
and
this
man
has
told
him
that
this
is
true,
this
is
investigated
and
he
knows
that
his
word
is
reliable
and
so
forth?
chief

earl
warren
why
do
you
say
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
do
you
say
that?
that
a
good
citizen
and
a
businessman
might
not
do
such
a
thing?
suppose
he
had
an
apartment
in
the
same
building
and
he
didn't
want
gamblers
to
be
in
there
and
he
told
the
police
that
he
knew
that
there
was
a
gambling
operation
there,
would
that
be
normal?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
the
surveillance
in
and
of
itself
mean
anything
in
the
affidavit
of
that
kind?
suppose
they
have
it
under

for
a
month
and
don't
see
a

does
that
prove
anything
that
they
have
