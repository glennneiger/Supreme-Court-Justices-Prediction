justice

suppose
the
affidavit
had
said
the
confidential
informant
of
known
reliability,
would
that
have
made
a
difference?
justice
abe
fortas
but
would
that
may
--
would
that
have
cured
the
alleged
vice
in
the
search
warrant?
justice
abe
fortas
but,
what
would
they
have
to
do?
justice
abe
fortas
would
they
have
to
disclose
the
name
of
the
person
in
the
search
warrant?
justice
abe
fortas
if
they
wouldn't
have
to
disclose
the
name,
what
would
they
have
to
disclose?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
let's
say
it's
a
reliable
inf
--
confidential
informant
of
known
reliability.
would
it
serve
your
purposes
if
there's
added
to
that
"who
has
furnished
this
agent,"
say,
"with
information
about
gambling
on
other
occasions"?
justice
abe
fortas
for
a
known
reliability.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that's
a
bothersome
point
in
the
case,
isn't
it?
that
is
to
say
that
--
just
how
much
has
to
be
shown
in
a
search
warrant.
now,
we
have
a
confidential
informant,
you're
--
say
that
we're
getting
warm
anyway,
if
the
affidavit
had
said
confidential
and
informant
of
known
reliability
who
has
furnished
information
about
gambling
operations
on
other
occasions.
justice
abe
fortas
why?
justice
abe
fortas
what
are
the
other
reasons?
justice
abe
fortas
they
don't
need
anything
else
to
establish
probable
cause.
justice
abe
fortas
and
that
he's
giving
this
information,
there
were
facts
on
other
gambling
situations,
and
that
these
are
reliable.
justice
abe
fortas
it's
going
to
have
more
than
all
of
that?
justice
abe
fortas
but
what
else
would
it
have
to
have?
justice
abe
fortas
is
there
any
authority
for
all
of
that?
justice
abe
fortas
and
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
connoly
i
complement
you
on
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
want
to
complement
you
on
your
handling
of
those
questions.
justice
abe
fortas
may
i
call
your
attention
to
page
27
of
the
record,
the
opinion
below.
in
that
list,
the
court's
understanding
of
what
the
affidavit
says,
are
you
in
agreement
that
that
is
a
fair
summary
of
the
affidavit
and
so
far
as
it
relates
to
the
question
of
probable
cause?
justice
abe
fortas
that's
right,
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
well
it
wouldn't
be
any
point
and
all
this
was
--
justice
abe
fortas
silly
--
apparently
sillier
recital
about
the
petitioner's
premise
except
for
the
purpose
of
showing
that
he
went
to
this
apartment
as
if
it
were
a
place
of
work.
is
that
your
inference
from
it
that
i'd
say
he'd
go
there
every
morning
as
if
he
were
employed
there.
justice
abe
fortas
as
if
it
were
not
his
home.
justice
abe
fortas
the
affidavit
here
does
show
a
surveillance
by
the
fbi,
does
it
not?
justice
abe
fortas
in
aguilar,
there
was
no
surveillance
by
the
fbi
shown
by
the
affidavits,
right?
justice
abe
fortas
and
the
court
in
footnote
one
know
what
you
have
referred
did
emphasize
that
point.
justice
abe
fortas
well
you,
what
do
you
do
about
footnote
1
in
aguilar
at
number
one
and
number
two?
you
don't
contend,
do
you
that
this
is
as
clear
a
case
for
your
purposes
as
aguilar.
aguilar
was
just
a
very
brief
statement
that
a
confidential
informant
had
furnished
information,
that's
all
and
here
it's
arguably
and
a
way
there
is
other
information.
justice
abe
fortas
do
you
take
the
position
that
this
is
as
clear
a
case
as
aguilar?
justice
abe
fortas
well
what
actually
--
what
actually
happened
here,
as
stated
by
the
government
on
page
four
of
its
brief,
that
is
not
said
out
in
the
affidavit,
but
the
government
says
that
what
actually
happened
is
that
agents
in
another
apartment
overheard
a
bookmaking
operation
being
conducted
over
telephones
in
the
apartment
in
question
here
and
they
alleged
that
this
was
not
assisted
by
any
mechanical
amplification,
somebody
had
very
good
ears
i
guess.
justice
abe
fortas
and
--
yes.
and
then
thereafter
they
conducted
a
surveillance
for
about
three
weeks,
surveillance
of
the
petitioner
for
about
three
weeks.
now
what
the
affidavit
does
here
is
to
pick
up
the
point
of
surveillance
and
talks
about
the
interstate
features
of
petitioner's
activities
and
it
shows
surveillance
in
the
interstate
activities
and
then
it
has
the
information
on
it
about
the
telephones,
may
or
may
not
be
meaningful.
the
reputation
of
the
petitioner
which
may
or
may
not
be
meaningful
and
that's
about
some
in
substance
of
it
but
whatever
that
may
add
up
to
in
one's
mind,
it
certainly
a
great
deal
more
i
should
think
than
the
naked
allegation
and
the
search
for
naked
statement
and
the
search
for
it
in
aguilar.
justice
abe
fortas
well
it
comes
down,
i
suppose
it
comes
down
to
a
question
of
how
strict
the
standards
for
a
probable
cause
in
an
affidavit
must
be
on
the
constitution
in
order
to
justify
the
issue
and
serve
a
search
warrant
with
perhaps
does
this
case
present
a
problem
that
is
more
difficult
than
aguilar?
justice
abe
fortas
you'll
agree
with
that,
won't
you?
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
the
affidavit
had
said
the
confidential
informant
of
known
reliability,
would
that

would
that
may

would
that

justice
abe
fortas

what
would
they
have
to
do?
justice
abe
fortas
would
they
have
to
disclose
the
name
of
the
person
in
the
search
warrant?
justice
abe
fortas

they
wouldn't

the
name,
what
