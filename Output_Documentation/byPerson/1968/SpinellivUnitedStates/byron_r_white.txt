justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
take
it
you
feel
that
the
thrust
of
aguilar
is
only
to
verify
or
to
support
the
thrustworthiness
of
the
informer
in
the
sense
of
his
honesty.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
say
underlying
circumstances
to
show
that
the
informer
is
reliable.
if
that
were
the
only
thrust
of
aguilar,
i
suppose
an
experienced
police
officer
that
a
judge
knew
was
--
or
at
least
he
thought
was
a
very
honest
man,
because
that's
all
that
was
necessary.
he
could
just
take
a
policeman
statement
that
there
is
gambling
in
a
certain
address,
period.
but
that
wouldn't
be
sufficient,
would
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
part
of
aguilar
tested
is
not
just
that
the
fellow
is
telling
them
--
justice
byron
r.
white
now
tell
me
what
is
there
in
this
information
that
would
justify
an
inference
that
there
was
gambling
going
on.
now
let's
assume,
let's
just
assume
that
the
thrustworthiness
of
the
informer
has
been
adequately
proved
by
the
police
think
he's
reliable
and
they
say
he's
reliable
but
now,
where
are
the
facts
that
will
justify
an
inference
that
there
was
an
illegal
activity
going
on
at
a
certain
address?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
know,
i
know
it
but
you
know
that
that
isn't
enough
just
to
say
aguilar
says
you
have
to
have
the
underlying
circumstances
from
which
you
deduce
that
there's
gambling
going
on.
now
what
are
those?
two
telephones.
justice
byron
r.
white
quite
relevant.
justice
byron
r.
white
quite
relevant
from
what
facts
do
you
deduce,
or
is
it
reasonable
to
conclude
that
there's
gambling
going
on
to
that
address?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
it's
that
statement
that
gambing
which
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
for
which
he
has
some
underlying
circumstances.
justice
byron
r.
white
i'm
talking
about
the
part
of
aguilar
that
refers
to
underlying
circumstances,
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
read
is
all
if
necessary
then,
is
that
the
police
somehow
support
the
veracity
of
the
informer?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
think
if
that's
what
you're
arguing,
that
as
long
as
some
of
his
information
has
been
verified,
that
proves
that
he's
a
reliable
person
and
therefore
we
may
accept
his
blank
statement
that
there
is
gambling
going
on
without
any
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
reason
for
--
without
any
explanations
of
why
he
thought
gambling
going
on.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
so
difficult,
there
must
be
some
practical
reason
for
the
government
not
saying
in
their
affidavit,
well
the
informant
said
he
saw
gambling
or
some
other
circumstance.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
agree
with
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
is
there
some
reason
why
the
government
doesn't,
in
the
counter
affidavit
say
what
the
source
of
the
informant's
information
is?
do
you
think
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
that
would
surface
him
too
much?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
connoly,
i
take
it
that
you
do
agree
that
this
one
man
to
the
aguilar
test
was
added
to
the
percentage
of
--.
maybe
the
magistrate
says
that
the
magistrate
must
be
informed
with
some
of
the
with
some
of
the
undersigned
--
from
which
the
informant
includes
that
the
narcotics
before
they
return
to
him
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
efficient
in
and
then
that
was
fast
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
it
certainly
is
that
in
this
plain
case
that
the
affidavit
is
good,
but
in
a
different
way
that
the
informant
becomes
credible
to
rely
on?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
hardly
--
you
would
suggest
that
that
first
branh,
if
you
call
it,
would
overrule
draper?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
enough?
is
this
--
had
said
this
information
comes
from
the
same
information
comes
from
an
informant.
we've
had
20
successful
experience
with
which
to
rely
to.
would
that
be
alright
to
charge
him?
justice
byron
r.
white
--
that
you're
not
in
this
stuff
when
you
might
say
"let's
just
settle
the
--
performance."
justice
byron
r.
white
whats
was
--
what
about
draber?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
think
if
the
--
as
far
as
you're
concerned
with
being
logical
if
a
policeman
made
an
affidavit
saying
that
an
informant
believes
that
reliable
which
brings
with,
with
last
year
50
times."
except
those
gamblings
going
on
with
a
certain
guess,
period.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
a
warrant
would
issue
on
that
affidavit?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
take
it
you
feel
that
the
thrust

but
you
say
underlying

that
the

is

if
that

the

i
