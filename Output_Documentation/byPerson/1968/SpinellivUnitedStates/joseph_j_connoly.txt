mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
united
states
commissioner,
reasonably
found,
on
the
facts
contained
in
this
affidavit,
that
there
is
probable
cause
to
search
apartment
1108
indian
circle
drive.
petitioner's
argument
proceeds
by
separating
at
each
statement
in
the
affidavit
and
showing
wherein
that
statement
fails
to
supply
certain
information,
which
also
would
be
relevant
to
the
commissioners
finding
the
probable
cause.
by
adding
up
the
alleged
deficiencies,
petitioner
concludes
that
there
was
no
probable
cause.
but
that
analysis
is
not
fully
responsive
to
the
question
here.
the
primary
inquiry
is
not
what
the
affidavit
did
not
contain,
but
what
it
did
contain.
whether
there
were
enough
facts
on
which
the
commissioner
could
make
his
own
independent
judgment
of
the
grounds
for
a
search,
and
whether
tat
judgment
on
the
affidavit
taken
as
a
whole,
was
reasonable.
cause
for
reversal
lies
not
in
whether
a
judge
were
on
review,
would
not
have
issued
the
warrant
because
of
the
absence
of
certain
particular
information,
but
whether
there
was
such
a
complete
lack
of
information
that
that
the
commissioner's
apparent
finding
was
nothing
more
than
a
rubber
stamp
for
the
police.
petitioner's
counsel
is
discussed
what
the
affidavit
did
not
contain,
but
i
would
like
to
say
it
out
briefly
what
it
did
contain.
it
stated
that
the
fbi
had
received
information
from
a
confidential,
reliable
informant,
that
petitioner
was
operating
a
handbook
and
accepting
wagering
information
over
two
specified
telephone
numbers,
way
down
40029
and
way
down
40136.
it
stated
the
petitioner
is
known
to
agent
bender,
who
was
the
affiant,
to
other
federal
agents
and
to
local
police
as
a
bookmaker
and
as
a
gambler.
it
also
showed
the
results
of
the
agent's
own
investigation,
to
corroborate
the
information
which
had
been
received.
it
said
that
the
telephone
company
record
showed
that
both
telephone
specified
by
the
informant,
were
in
operation
and
that
both
of
them
were
located
in
apartment
f,
at
1108
indian
circle
drive,
under
the
name
of
grace
hagen.
it
showed
the
petitioner
had
been
under
surveillance
by
the
fbi
during
the
three
weeks
preceding
the
application
for
the
warrant.
when
the
four
consecutive
business
days
he
was
followed,
he
drove
from
illinois
into
st.
louis
in
the
early
morning,
and
then
roughly
at
the
same
time
every
afternoon,
he
drove
out
to
olivette,
missouri,
a
suburb
some
30
minutes
drive
from
downtown
st.
louis
and
went
to
apartment
f
at
1108
indian
circle
drive.
the
apartment
whiched
contain
the
two
telephones
specified
by
the
informant.
this
affidavit
answered
the
commissioner's
hypothetical
question,
what
makes
you
think
that
there
is
bookmaking
going
on
in
apartment
f?
agent
bender
replied,
"because
i
received
specific
information
from
a
reliable
informant
about
a
bookmaking
operation
by
an
individual
whom
i
know
to
be
a
bookmaker.
and
because
i
verified
that
information
by
my
own
investigation
and
by
the
observations
of
petitioner's
conduct."
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
well,
mr.
justice,
the
affidavit
first
of
all
didn't
set,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
affidavit
didn't
say
that
the
apartment
at
1108
indian
circle
drive
was
his
apartment.
from
the
face
of
the
affidavit,
it
appears
that
he
lived
in
illinois,
came
over
to
st.
louis
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
well
the
only
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
well,
the
incriminating
aspect
of
it
mr.
chief
justice
is
that
that
apartment
contained
the
two
telephones
specified
by
the
informant,
that
he
was
a
known
bookmaker,
and
that
a
known
bookmaker
making
regular
visits
to
an
apartment
with
two
telephones,
itself
provide
some
suspicion.
now
i'm
not
saying
that
that
conduct,
that
observed
conduct
by
itself
would
be
at
all
sufficient
to
satisfy
probable
cause.
but
what
it
did
do
was
it
corroborated
the
information
which
was
received
from
the
informant
that
he
is
carrying
on
a
handbook
operation
by
the
use
of
the
two
telephones
in
his
apartment.
very
much
the
way,
draper's
conduct
in
the
draper
case
corroborated
hereford's
information.
hereford
said
that
draper
would
be
coming
in
on
a
train,
either
one
of
two
days,
i
think
september
8th
or
september
9th,
hereford
described
the
way
draper
would
be
dressed
and
said
that
he
would
be
carrying
a
tan
zipper
bag.
well
on
the
second
day
that
the
agents
were
waiting
in
the
railroad
station,
a
man
came
out,
fitting
the
description
that
hereford
had
given
of
draper,
walking
hardly
and
carrying
a
tan
zipper
bag.
and
the
court
held,
that
with
all
the
other
information
that
hereford
had
given,
corroborated
by
the
agent's
investigation,
there
was
probable
cause
to
believe
that
the
incriminating
accusation
i.e.
that
draper
was
carrying
narcotics,
also
would
be
corroborated.
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
there's
certainly
nothing
which
would
give
probable
cause
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
mr.
chief
justice,
petitioner
correctly
points
out
that
it
is
sufficient
that
the
finding
of
probable
cause
does
depend
upon
their
being
adequate
assurance
of
thrustworthiness
of
the
hearsay
information.
now
in
jones
versus
the
united
states,
this
court
held
that
a
valid
affidavit
may
be
issued
in
the
basis
of
information
supplied
by
an
unnamed
person
as
long
as
there
is
a
reasonable
basis
for
corroborating
the
hearsay.
and
in
the
jones
case,
the
court
found
the
reasonable
basis
for
corroborating
the
hearsay.
in
the
officer's
statement
that
the
informant
have
previously
given
accurate
information,
that
his
story
was
corroborated
by
other
sources
of
information,
and
that
the
suspect
to
the
informant's
tip
was
known
by
the
police
to
be
a
user
of
narcotics.
petitioner
relies
heavily
on
the
aguilar
case,
a
subsequent
case
in
which
the
court
considered
the
sufficiency
of
the
affidavit
which
presume
to
rely
on
hearsay
information.
i
say
presume
to
rely
hearsay
information
because
there's
a
world
of
difference
between
this
case
and
the
aguilar
case.
the
aguilar
case,
in
fact
did
not
tell
us
--
the
affidavit
in
the
aguilar
case
did
not
say
exactly
what
information
had
been
received
in
the
informant.
the
affidavit
began
that
the
police
have
reason
to
believe
and
do
believe
that
aguilar
kept
narcotics
in
his
house.
and
then
it
went
on
to
say
that
the
officers
have
received
reliable
information
from
a
credible
person
and
do
believe
that
heroin,
marijuana,
barbiturates
and
other
narcotics
are
being
kept
for
sale
at
aguilar's
house.
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
it's
critically
different
mr.
chief
justice
because
there
is
nothing
in
the
aguilar
affidavit
that
says
what
information
was
given
to
the
police.
it
said
that
the
officer
say
they
had
received
reliable
information
from
a
credible
person.
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
and
do
--
it
didn't
say
that,
and
do
believe.
from
all
that
appears
in
the
affidavit
in
aguilar,
it
differed
from
the
defective
affidavits
in
nathanson
and
giordenello.
only
in
the
sense
that
the
officer's
own
belief
was
supported
some
extent
by
the
fact
that
they
had
received
undisclosed
information
from
an
unnamed
person.
that
was
the
only
real
difference
between
the
affidavit
in
aguilar
and
the
defective
documents
in
those
two
cases.
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
reliable
informant?
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
no
mr.
chief
justice,
i
don't
believe
it
would
be
a
burden
on
the
government.
the
court's
approval
in
aguilar,
of
the
affidavit
in
jones
indicates
that
the
test
of
aguilar
with
respect
to
the
informant's
general
reliability
may
be
satisfied
by
a
statement
which
says
that
the
informant
had
provided
information
on
one
previous
occasion.
that's
not
a
great
burden
on
the
government
mr.
chief
justice
but
i
think
at
this
point
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
the
government
believes
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
yes
it
does.
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
well
mr.
chief
justice,
to
go
back
to
perhaps
the
source
of
the
statement
in
the
handy
guide
to
legal
search
and
seizure
is
that
the
requirement
in
aguilar,
that
there
be
some
underlying
circumstances
to
justify
believing
the
informer
was
generally
reliable.
i
believe
it's
misconstrued
by
a
petitioner.
there's
nothing
in
the
aguilar
case
which
tells
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
all
right
i'll
take
off
from
my
own
bulletin.
suppose
that
the
informer
is
not
an
informer
with
whom
the
agents
have
had
any
prior
dealings
at
all
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
they
could
put
that
in,
mr.
chief
justice
although
if
they're
--
i
think
rarely
would
be
situations
in
which
a
businessman
or
a
bank
president
or
someone
like
that
be
giving
information
about
a
gambling
place.
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
but
suppose
they
just
don't
know.
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
no
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
that
would
be
--
i
was
particularly
thinking
about
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
well
there's
certainly
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
mr.
justice
i
think
that
there
would
be
a
very
natural
reservation
for
the
individual
to
place
himself,
certainly
to
place
himself
in
a
position
where
adverse
action
may
be
taken
against
him
by
the
criminal
element.
but,
in
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
you're
absolutely
correct
about
the
circumstances
in
which
a
citizen
might
see
a
bookmaking
operation
going
on
next
door
and
report
it
to
the
police.
in
some
manner,
i
was
particularly
thinking
about
the
type
of
information
that
was
supplied
in
this
case
which
was
really,
it
was
insider
information,
it
was
business
information,
not
the
type
of
information
that
one
could
take
out
just
by
observation.
but
again
getting
back
to
what
this
handbook
says,
aguilar
does
suggest
that
there
must
be
some
underlying
circumstance
for
believing
the
informer's
reliability.
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
no,
i
certainly
don't.
i
think
that's
petitioner's
position.
my
feeling
about
aguilar
in
this
whole
stream
of
cases
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
mr.
justice
white,
i
was
going
to
go
on
to
say
that
petitioner
has
indicated
that
he
thinks
that's
the
thrust
of
aguilar.
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
it's
the
reliability
of
the
information.
that's
the
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
well
the
facts
are
that
the
--
the
information
says
that
an
illegal
business
is
being
conducted
through
the
use
of
two
specific
telephones.
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
i'm
not
sure
if
i
understand
the
justices'
question.
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
are
you
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
because
the
informant
has
said
that
gambling
is
going
on
through
the
use
of
two
telephones,
because
the
two
telephones
are
both
an
operation
and
that
both
at
this
address.
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
all
right,
if
the
justice
is
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
if
the
justice
is
referring
to
the
statement
in
aguilar
which
says
that
there
must
be
some
showing
of
the
underlying
circumstances
on
which
the
informant
based
his
statement
--
is
that
the
part
of
aguilar
that
the
justice
is
referring
to?
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
well
we
--
we
admit
that
there
is
nothing
in
this
affidavits
which
meets
that
particular
requirement
of
the
aguilar
formula.
but
in
response
to
your
question,
i
would
like
to
say
two
things,
the
first
case
is
that
aguilar
itself
established
the
basis
for
a
material
distinction
between
this
case
and
aguilar.
in
footnote
1
of
aguilar,
the
court
said
that
where
there
is
--
if
the
magistrate
had
been
informed
that
the
fact
is
also
the
surveillance,
that
would
be
and
entirely
different
case.
and
we
think
we
have
an
entirely
different
case
here.
the
implication
of
that
statement
in
footnote
1
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
well
it's
not
so
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
well
mr.
justice
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
well,
the
first
place,
that's
what
the
footnote
1
in
aguilar
seems
to
say
that
can
be
done
because
in
no
sense,
or
in
very,
very
few
situations,
i
can't
think
of
any
right
now,
can
a
surveillance
supply
the
deficiency
which
we're
talking
about
right
now.
that
is
if
the
affidavit
doesn't
tell
you
how
the
informant
got
his
information.
nothing
in
your
surveillance
is
going
to
tell
you
how
to
inform
he
got
his
information.
now
the
other
thing
that
i'd
like
to
say
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
there
is
nothing,
mr.
justice
white,
there
is
nothing
in
aguilar
which
suggests
that
the
only
satisfactory
showing
of
the
underlying
circumstances
in
which
the
informant
gained
his
information
was
from
personal
observation.
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
so
in
the
decision
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
well
just
as
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
just
as
in
the
cases
in
which
the
government
chooses
not
to
identify
the
informant
by
name,
there
is
some
risk
that
the
circumstances
in
which
the
informant
gained
his
information
will
serve
to
identify
him
and
that
there
may
be
recriminations
against
him.
but
to
go
on
with
our
discussion,
i'd
also
like
to
point
out
that
the
information
in
this
case,
that
is
the
intrinsic
facts
of
the
hearsay
information
deserve
some
way,
they're
not
merely
an
empty
vessel
that
are
given
probative
value
when
we
buy
the
corroborating
testimony.
the
informant
told
the
agents
the
type
of
gambling
activity
petitioner
was
carrying
on,
the
way
it
was
being
conducted
and
the
specific
telephone
numbers
that
were
being
used.
now,
from
our
reading
of
aguilar,
we
believe
that
the
primary
concern
which
prompted
the
court
to
require
some
of
the
underlying
circumstances
surrounding
the
informant's
acquisition
of
his
knowledge,
was
the
concern
that
an
individual's
unfounded
or
ill-founded
suspicion
could
be
in
doubt
with
the
appearance
of
fact
merely
because
that
individual
appeared
in
the
affidavit
as
a
reliable
informant
rather
than
is
the
affiant
himself.
and
we
think
that
that
risk
is
substantially
reduced
in
this
case
because
the
details
of
the
information
showed
a
working
familiarity
with
the
way
petitioner
carried
on
his
business.
the
details
greatly
reduced
the
risk
that
the
information
was
the
product
of
the
informant's
own
mere
suspicion.
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
they
were
in
a
two-storey,
eight-unit
garden-type
apartment.
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
no
sir,
it
was
petitioner's
bookmaking
operation.
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
well
there
was
a
meager
amount
of
furniture.
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
that's
right.
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
it
does
not
appear
from
the
affidavit.
my
recollection
is
that
there
is
no
testimony
which
shows
that
they
knew
that
in
the
case.
they
did
conduct
an
investigation
around
the
apartment
building
and
they
made
arrangements
with
the
man
who
had
the
apartment
across
the
hall
but
the
record
doesn't
show
exactly
at
the
time
of
the
search
what
they
knew.
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
yes
mr.
justice,
we
certainly
do.
we
think
that
the
policies
which
the
court
announced
in
ventresca
are
that
where
the
commissioner
can
make
an
independent
determination
on
the
basis
of
the
facts
in
this
affidavit
and
that
where
his
finding
is
not
clearly
unreasonable
that
the
finding
a
probable
cause
should
not
be
set
aside.
we
place
great
emphasis
on
it.
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
yes
mr.
justice.
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
well
no
mr.
justice
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
no,
mr.
justice,
the
court
is
consistently
taking
the
position
that
it
is
not
the
function
of
an
appellate
court
to
review
de
novo.
the
finding
of
probable
cause.
the
court
has
taken
the
position
that
it
will
look
to
essentially
the
types
of
information
upon
which
a
commissioner
reasonably
can
rely
in
making
a
finding
a
probable
cause.
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
then
we
believe
that
the
standards
were
met
in
this
case
because
the
commissioner
relied
upon
types
of
information
which
this
court
has
specifically
approved.
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
mr.
justice,
the
record
does
not
show
exactly
how
many
years
experience
agent
bender
had.
agent
bradley,
who
was
the
agent
who
dealt
with
the
informant
on
a
regular
basis
for
two
years
was
an
fbi
agent
with
18
years
experience.
and
i'm
not
sure
from
the
circumstances
whether
agent
bender
was
the
senior
agent
in
the
investigation,
he
certainly
seemed
to
be
in
charge
of
the
operation.
he
may
be
more
experienced
or
he
just
might
have
had
a
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
the
affiant
was
agent
bender.
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
i
suppose
that
that
would
be
the
operation
of
the
court's
decision.
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
--
reversing
--
reversing
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
i'm
sorry
sir?
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
thank
you
sir.
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
well
mr.
justice,
without
quivering
with
some
details,
i
tell
you
you're
talking
about
the
listing
at
the
bottom
of
page
27?
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
the
affidavit
did
not
--
i'm
not
quibbling
with
minor
details
in
it.
the
affidavit
did
not
say
that
the
apartment
was
not
petitioner's
home
but
it
can
reasonably
be
inferred,
we
believe
from
the
affidavit
that
it
was
not
his
home.
in
order
for
it
to
be
his
home,
he
somehow
would
have
had
to
have
gotten
over
the
east
st.
louis,
illinois
in
the
morning
then
to
come
back
through
that
way
and
the
agents
--
there
is
nothing
in
the
affidavit
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
that's
right.
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
yes
mr.
justice,
those
are
the
facts.
now
the
only
reason
that
i
was
hedging
is
that
the
affidavit
picked
him
up,
not
at
his
home
but
as
he
was
starting
across
the
east
side
of
the
bridge
into
st.
louis
in
the
morning
so
i
have,
in
order
to
defend
the
affidavit,
i
have
to
infer
that
the
apartment
f
was
not
home
but
that
his
home
was
where
he
came
from
in
the
morning
that
is
in
st.
louis,
illinois.
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
yes
mr.
justice,
that's
his
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
if
the
court
please,
i'd
like
to
try
to
tie
up
our
argument
with
respect
to
this
efficiency
of
the
affidavit
and
the
thrustworthiness
of
hearsay
by
referring
to
the
policies
annunciated
by
this
court
in
united
states
versus
ventresca.
the
court's
opinion,
written
by
mr.
justice
goldberg,
who
was
the
author
of
the
opinion
in
aguilar,
stated
that
where
an
affidavit
sets
out
facts
on
which
the
magistrate
can
make
an
independent
determination
of
the
grounds
for
a
search.
the
court
should
not
set
aside
the
magistrate's
finding
of
probable
cause
by
interpreting
the
affidavit
in
a
hyper
technical,
rather
than
a
common
sense
manner.
the
court
recognized
in
ventresca,
as
it
did
in
jones,
that
in
the
circumstances
in
which
affidavits
are
normally
drafted
by
policemen
in
the
midst
of
a
criminal
investigation
and
without
legal
assistance
if
the
affidavit
is
bound
to
leave
some
questions
unanswered.
the
affidavit
here
does
not
answer
all
the
questions
which
might
have
occurred
to
the
commissioner.
he
would
have
been
more
confident
in
his
finding
if
he
had
been
told
to
the
extent
to
which
the
informant
had
provided
accurate
information
of
the
past.
he
may
have
been
curious
as
to
whether
the
agents
had
been
able
to
determine
the
volume
of
calls
to
the
two
telephones
or
whether
there
really
was
a
grace
hagen
for
other
questions.
but
the
teaching
of
ventresca
is
that
the
affidavit's
failure
to
supply
certain
facts
is
fatal
only
if
it
undermines
the
reasonableness
of
the
inferences
which
may
be
drawn
from
the
facts
which
the
affidavit
does
continue,
or
put
it
another
way,
only
if
the
inference
is
rest
to
heavily
on
the
officer's
good
faith,
rather
than
the
magistrate's
own
independent
judgment.
the
critical
issue
in
this
case
is
the
thrustworthiness
of
the
hearsay.
the
corroborating
information
of
the
affidavit
provided
a
basis
in
which
the
commissioner
defined
the
hearsay
thrustworthy
without
relying
on
the
agent's
good
faith.
the
reasonableness
of
that
finding
is
not
undermined
by
the
defects
which
petitioner
alleges.
the
court
in
ventresca
also
cautioned
that
a
grudging
where
negative
attitude
by
reviewing
boards
to
award
warrants,
will
tend
to
discourage
police
officers
from
submitting
their
evidence
to
a
judicial
officer
before
acting.
the
concern
which
prompted
that
statement,
i
believe
is
illustrated
by
the
facts
of
this
case.
we
believe
that
agent
bender
did
have
at
least
a
reasonable
option
to
decide
whether
to
go
get
a
search
warrant
or
to
go
in
on
the
basis
of
the
information
he
had
without
a
warrant.
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
it
does.
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
the
affidavits
showed
no
surveillance
and
of
course
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
yes
sir
it
did.
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
no,
mr
justice.
i
believe
in
footnote
one
in
aguilar
said,
if
the
facts
and
results
of
such
a
surveillance
had
been
presented
to
the
magistrate,
it
would
have
been
a
different
case.
certainly,
in
so
far
as
any
indication
of
illegal
activity,
the
existence
of
a
surveillance
is
not
meaningful.
but
in
this
case,
the
existence
of
a
surveillance
is
meaningful,
particularly
with
reference
to
whether
the
informant
was
a
reliable
informant.
we
submit
that
the
commissioner
was
justified
in
relying
on
the
fact
that
on
the
basis
of
the
information
which
the
fbi
received
from
the
informant,
the
instituted
the
three
weeks
of
surveillance
involving
numerous
agents.
certainly
the
fbi
does
not
act
injudiciously
with
its
time.
and
this
is
an
indication
of
the
credence
which
they
placed
in
this
informant's
information.
thank
you.
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
that's
right
mr.
justice.
we
believe
that
that
certainly
is
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
the
affidavit
doesn't
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
but
we
think
that
the
affidavit
is
good
on
the
basis
of
the
whole
--
that
the
policy
is
of
the
entire
line
of
cases
in
this
area.
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
oh
yes,
it
would
certainly
overrule
draper.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
mr.
justice,
we
believe
that
the
commissioner
found
that
the
hearsay
information
was
thrustworthy
and
that
was
the
important
finding.
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
mr.
justice
i
don't
think
that
that
position
could
be
squared
with
aguilar.
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
i
don't
believe
that
that
position,
if
we
took
that
position.
i
don't
believe
we
could
square
it
with
aguilar.
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
well
i
really
think
that
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
well,
mr.
justice
in
the
particular
circumstances
in
which
the
particular
facts
of
aguilar,
that
is
a
case
where
the
reliability,
the
thrustworthiness
of
the
information
could
only
be
determined
by
two
things.
one
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
by
two
things.
one,
whether
it
came
from
a
reliable
person
and
two,
the
circumstances
in
which
that
person
obtained
the
information.
there
were
no
other
surveillance,
there
was
no
indication
of
knowledge
on
the
part
of
the
agents,
there
wasn't
anything
else.
and
i
think
that
the
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
because
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
well,
i
think
that
the
government
would
have
difficulty
maintaining
that
position
because
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
well
we
think
certainly
as
a
matter
of
common
sense
that
is
something
which
we
can
find
supportable
in
very,
very
many
cases.
but
the
giordenello-aguilar
line
of
cases
does
suggest
that
the
court
will
require
something
more
of
the
officers
than
merely
their
statement.
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
yes
mr.
justice
black,
at
least
in
a
circumstance
where
there
is
nothing
but
the
hearsay
information
which
was
the
particular
facts
in
aguilar
and
limiting
it
to
that.
at
least
in
that
case,
we
believe
that
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
well
i
know
it
sir,
i
mean
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
not
in
this
case,
no.
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
no,
no,
not
in
this
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
no
it
was
not
hearsay.
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
united
states
commissioner,
reasonably
found,
on
the
facts
contained
in
this
affidavit,
that
there
is
probable
cause
to
search
apartment
1108
indian
circle
drive.
petitioner's
argument
proceeds
by
separating
at
each
statement
in
the
affidavit
and
showing
wherein
that
statement
fails
to
supply
certain
information,
which
also
would
be
relevant
to
the
commissioners
finding
the
probable
cause.
by
adding
up
the
alleged
deficiencies,
petitioner
concludes
that
there
was
no
probable
cause.
but
that
analysis
is
not
fully
responsive
to
the
question
here.
the
primary
inquiry
is
not
what
the
affidavit
did
not
contain,
but
what
it
did
contain.
whether
there
were
enough
facts
on
which
the
commissioner
could
make
his
own
independent
judgment
of
the
grounds
for
a
search,
and
whether
tat
judgment
on
the
affidavit
taken
as
a
whole,
was
reasonable.
cause
for
reversal
lies
not
in
whether
a
judge
were
on
review,
would
not
have
issued
the
warrant
because
of
the
absence
of
certain
particular
information,
but
whether
there
was
such
a
complete
lack
of
information
that
that
the
commissioner's
apparent
finding
was
nothing
more
than
a
rubber
stamp
for
the
police.
petitioner's
counsel
is
discussed
what
the
affidavit
did
not
contain,
but
i
would
like
to
say
it
out
briefly
what
it
did
contain.
it
stated
that
the
fbi
had
received
information
from
a
confidential,
reliable
informant,
that
petitioner
was
operating
a
handbook
and
accepting
wagering
information
over
two
specified
telephone
numbers,
way
down
40029
and
way
down
40136.
it
stated
the
petitioner
is
known
to
agent
bender,
who
was
the
affiant,
to
other
federal
agents
and
to
local
police
as
a
bookmaker
and
as
a
gambler.
it
also
showed
the
results
of
the
agent's
own
investigation,
to
corroborate
the
information
which
had
been
received.
it
said
that
the
telephone
company
record
showed
that
both
telephone
specified
by
the
informant,
were
in
operation
and
that
both
of
them
were
located
in
apartment
f,
at
1108
indian
circle
drive,
under
the
name
of
grace
hagen.
it
showed
the
petitioner
had
been
under
surveillance
by
the
fbi
during
the
three
weeks
preceding
the
application
for
the
warrant.
when
the
four
consecutive
business
days
he
was
followed,
he
drove
from
illinois
into
st.
louis
in
the
early
morning,
and
then
roughly
at
the
same
time
every
afternoon,
he
drove
out
to
olivette,
missouri,
a
suburb
some
30
minutes
drive
from
downtown
st.
louis
and
went
to
apartment
f
at
1108
indian
circle
drive.
the
apartment
whiched
contain
the
two
telephones
specified
by
the
informant.
this
affidavit
answered
the
commissioner's
hypothetical
question,
what
makes
you
think
that
there
is
bookmaking
going
on
in
apartment
f?
agent
bender
replied,
"because
i
received
specific
information
from
a
reliable
informant
about
a
bookmaking
operation
by
an
individual
whom
i
know
to
be
a
bookmaker.
and
because
i
verified
that
information
by
my
own
investigation
and
by
the
observations
of
petitioner's
conduct."
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
well,
mr.
justice,
the
affidavit
first
of
all
didn't
set,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
affidavit
didn't
say
that
the
apartment
at
1108
indian
circle
drive
was
his
apartment.
from
the
face
of
the
affidavit,
it
appears
that
he
lived
in
illinois,
came
over
to
st.
louis
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
well
the
only
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
well,
the
incriminating
aspect
of
it
mr.
chief
justice
is
that
that
apartment
contained
the
two
telephones
specified
by
the
informant,
that
he
was
a
known
bookmaker,
and
that
a
known
bookmaker
making
regular
visits
to
an
apartment
with
two
telephones,
itself
provide
some
suspicion.
now
i'm
not
saying
that
that
conduct,
that
observed
conduct
by
itself
would
be
at
all
sufficient
to
satisfy
probable
cause.
but
what
it
did
do
was
it
corroborated
the
information
which
was
received
from
the
informant
that
he
is
carrying
on
a
handbook
operation
by
the
use
of
the
two
telephones
in
his
apartment.
very
much
the
way,
draper's
conduct
in
the
draper
case
corroborated
hereford's
information.
hereford
said
that
draper
would
be
coming
in
on
a
train,
either
one
of
two
days,
i
think
september
8th
or
september
9th,
hereford
described
the
way
draper
would
be
dressed
and
said
that
he
would
be
carrying
a
tan
zipper
bag.
well
on
the
second
day
that
the
agents
were
waiting
in
the
railroad
station,
a
man
came
out,
fitting
the
description
that
hereford
had
given
of
draper,
walking
hardly
and
carrying
a
tan
zipper
bag.
and
the
court
held,
that
with
all
the
other
information
that
hereford
had
given,
corroborated
by
the
agent's
investigation,
there
was
probable
cause
to
believe
that
the
incriminating
accusation
i.e.
that
draper
was
carrying
narcotics,
also
would
be
corroborated.
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
there's
certainly
nothing
which
would
give
probable
cause
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
mr.
chief
justice,
petitioner
correctly
points
out
that
it
is
sufficient
that
the
finding
of
probable
cause
does
depend
upon
their
being
adequate
assurance
of
thrustworthiness
of
the
hearsay
information.
now
in
jones
versus
the
united
states,
this
court
held
that
a
valid
affidavit
may
be
issued
in
the
basis
of
information
supplied
by
an
unnamed
person
as
long
as
there
is
a
reasonable
basis
for
corroborating
the
hearsay.
and
in
the
jones
case,
the
court
found
the
reasonable
basis
for
corroborating
the
hearsay.
in
the
officer's
statement
that
the
informant
have
previously
given
accurate
information,
that
his
story
was
corroborated
by
other
sources
of
information,
and
that
the
suspect
to
the
informant's
tip
was
known
by
the
police
to
be
a
user
of
narcotics.
petitioner
relies
heavily
on
the
aguilar
case,
a
subsequent
case
in
which
the
court
considered
the
sufficiency
of
the
affidavit
which
presume
to
rely
on
hearsay
information.
i
say
presume
to
rely
hearsay
information
because
there's
a
world
of
difference
between
this
case
and
the
aguilar
case.
the
aguilar
case,
in
fact
did
not
tell
us
--
the
affidavit
in
the
aguilar
case
did
not
say
exactly
what
information
had
been
received
in
the
informant.
the
affidavit
began
that
the
police
have
reason
to
believe
and
do
believe
that
aguilar
kept
narcotics
in
his
house.
and
then
it
went
on
to
say
that
the
officers
have
received
reliable
information
from
a
credible
person
and
do
believe
that
heroin,
marijuana,
barbiturates
and
other
narcotics
are
being
kept
for
sale
at
aguilar's
house.
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
it's
critically
different
mr.
chief
justice
because
there
is
nothing
in
the
aguilar
affidavit
that
says
what
information
was
given
to
the
police.
it
said
that
the
officer
say
they
had
received
reliable
information
from
a
credible
person.
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
and
do
--
it
didn't
say
that,
and
do
believe.
from
all
that
appears
in
the
affidavit
in
aguilar,
it
differed
from
the
defective
affidavits
in
nathanson
and
giordenello.
only
in
the
sense
that
the
officer's
own
belief
was
supported
some
extent
by
the
fact
that
they
had
received
undisclosed
information
from
an
unnamed
person.
that
was
the
only
real
difference
between
the
affidavit
in
aguilar
and
the
defective
documents
in
those
two
cases.
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
reliable
informant?
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
no
mr.
chief
justice,
i
don't
believe
it
would
be
a
burden
on
the
government.
the
court's
approval
in
aguilar,
of
the
affidavit
in
jones
indicates
that
the
test
of
aguilar
with
respect
to
the
informant's
general
reliability
may
be
satisfied
by
a
statement
which
says
that
the
informant
had
provided
information
on
one
previous
occasion.
that's
not
a
great
burden
on
the
government
mr.
chief
justice
but
i
think
at
this
point
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
the
government
believes
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
yes
it
does.
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
well
mr.
chief
justice,
to
go
back
to
perhaps
the
source
of
the
statement
in
the
handy
guide
to
legal
search
and
seizure
is
that
the
requirement
in
aguilar,
that
there
be
some
underlying
circumstances
to
justify
believing
the
informer
was
generally
reliable.
i
believe
it's
misconstrued
by
a
petitioner.
there's
nothing
in
the
aguilar
case
which
tells
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
all
right
i'll
take
off
from
my
own
bulletin.
suppose
that
the
informer
is
not
an
informer
with
whom
the
agents
have
had
any
prior
dealings
at
all
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
they
could
put
that
in,
mr.
chief
justice
although
if
they're
--
i
think
rarely
would
be
situations
in
which
a
businessman
or
a
bank
president
or
someone
like
that
be
giving
information
about
a
gambling
place.
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
but
suppose
they
just
don't
know.
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
no
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
that
would
be
--
i
was
particularly
thinking
about
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
well
there's
certainly
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
mr.
justice
i
think
that
there
would
be
a
very
natural
reservation
for
the
individual
to
place
himself,
certainly
to
place
himself
in
a
position
where
adverse
action
may
be
taken
against
him
by
the
criminal
element.
but,
in
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
you're
absolutely
correct
about
the
circumstances
in
which
a
citizen
might
see
a
bookmaking
operation
going
on
next
door
and
report
it
to
the
police.
in
some
manner,
i
was
particularly
thinking
about
the
type
of
information
that
was
supplied
in
this
case
which
was
really,
it
was
insider
information,
it
was
business
information,
not
the
type
of
information
that
one
could
take
out
just
by
observation.
but
again
getting
back
to
what
this
handbook
says,
aguilar
does
suggest
that
there
must
be
some
underlying
circumstance
for
believing
the
informer's
reliability.
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
no,
i
certainly
don't.
i
think
that's
petitioner's
position.
my
feeling
about
aguilar
in
this
whole
stream
of
cases
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
mr.
justice
white,
i
was
going
to
go
on
to
say
that
petitioner
has
indicated
that
he
thinks
that's
the
thrust
of
aguilar.
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
it's
the
reliability
of
the
information.
that's
the
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
well
the
facts
are
that
the
--
the
information
says
that
an
illegal
business
is
being
conducted
through
the
use
of
two
specific
telephones.
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
i'm
not
sure
if
i
understand
the
justices'
question.
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
are
you
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
because
the
informant
has
said
that
gambling
is
going
on
through
the
use
of
two
telephones,
because
the
two
telephones
are
both
an
operation
and
that
both
at
this
address.
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
all
right,
if
the
justice
is
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
if
the
justice
is
referring
to
the
statement
in
aguilar
which
says
that
there
must
be
some
showing
of
the
underlying
circumstances
on
which
the
informant
based
his
statement
--
is
that
the
part
of
aguilar
that
the
justice
is
referring
to?
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
well
we
--
we
admit
that
there
is
nothing
in
this
affidavits
which
meets
that
particular
requirement
of
the
aguilar
formula.
but
in
response
to
your
question,
i
would
like
to
say
two
things,
the
first
case
is
that
aguilar
itself
established
the
basis
for
a
material
distinction
between
this
case
and
aguilar.
in
footnote
1
of
aguilar,
the
court
said
that
where
there
is
--
if
the
magistrate
had
been
informed
that
the
fact
is
also
the
surveillance,
that
would
be
and
entirely
different
case.
and
we
think
we
have
an
entirely
different
case
here.
the
implication
of
that
statement
in
footnote
1
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
well
it's
not
so
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
well
mr.
justice
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
well,
the
first
place,
that's
what
the
footnote
1
in
aguilar
seems
to
say
that
can
be
done
because
in
no
sense,
or
in
very,
very
few
situations,
i
can't
think
of
any
right
now,
can
a
surveillance
supply
the
deficiency
which
we're
talking
about
right
now.
that
is
if
the
affidavit
doesn't
tell
you
how
the
informant
got
his
information.
nothing
in
your
surveillance
is
going
to
tell
you
how
to
inform
he
got
his
information.
now
the
other
thing
that
i'd
like
to
say
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
there
is
nothing,
mr.
justice
white,
there
is
nothing
in
aguilar
which
suggests
that
the
only
satisfactory
showing
of
the
underlying
circumstances
in
which
the
informant
gained
his
information
was
from
personal
observation.
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
so
in
the
decision
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
well
just
as
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
just
as
in
the
cases
in
which
the
government
chooses
not
to
identify
the
informant
by
name,
there
is
some
risk
that
the
circumstances
in
which
the
informant
gained
his
information
will
serve
to
identify
him
and
that
there
may
be
recriminations
against
him.
but
to
go
on
with
our
discussion,
i'd
also
like
to
point
out
that
the
information
in
this
case,
that
is
the
intrinsic
facts
of
the
hearsay
information
deserve
some
way,
they're
not
merely
an
empty
vessel
that
are
given
probative
value
when
we
buy
the
corroborating
testimony.
the
informant
told
the
agents
the
type
of
gambling
activity
petitioner
was
carrying
on,
the
way
it
was
being
conducted
and
the
specific
telephone
numbers
that
were
being
used.
now,
from
our
reading
of
aguilar,
we
believe
that
the
primary
concern
which
prompted
the
court
to
require
some
of
the
underlying
circumstances
surrounding
the
informant's
acquisition
of
his
knowledge,
was
the
concern
that
an
individual's
unfounded
or
ill-founded
suspicion
could
be
in
doubt
with
the
appearance
of
fact
merely
because
that
individual
appeared
in
the
affidavit
as
a
reliable
informant
rather
than
is
the
affiant
himself.
and
we
think
that
that
risk
is
substantially
reduced
in
this
case
because
the
details
of
the
information
showed
a
working
familiarity
with
the
way
petitioner
carried
on
his
business.
the
details
greatly
reduced
the
risk
that
the
information
was
the
product
of
the
informant's
own
mere
suspicion.
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
they
were
in
a
two-storey,
eight-unit
garden-type
apartment.
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
no
sir,
it
was
petitioner's
bookmaking
operation.
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
well
there
was
a
meager
amount
of
furniture.
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
that's
right.
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
it
does
not
appear
from
the
affidavit.
my
recollection
is
that
there
is
no
testimony
which
shows
that
they
knew
that
in
the
case.
they
did
conduct
an
investigation
around
the
apartment
building
and
they
made
arrangements
with
the
man
who
had
the
apartment
across
the
hall
but
the
record
doesn't
show
exactly
at
the
time
of
the
search
what
they
knew.
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
yes
mr.
justice,
we
certainly
do.
we
think
that
the
policies
which
the
court
announced
in
ventresca
are
that
where
the
commissioner
can
make
an
independent
determination
on
the
basis
of
the
facts
in
this
affidavit
and
that
where
his
finding
is
not
clearly
unreasonable
that
the
finding
a
probable
cause
should
not
be
set
aside.
we
place
great
emphasis
on
it.
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
yes
mr.
justice.
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
well
no
mr.
justice
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
no,
mr.
justice,
the
court
is
consistently
taking
the
position
that
it
is
not
the
function
of
an
appellate
court
to
review
de
novo.
the
finding
of
probable
cause.
the
court
has
taken
the
position
that
it
will
look
to
essentially
the
types
of
information
upon
which
a
commissioner
reasonably
can
rely
in
making
a
finding
a
probable
cause.
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
then
we
believe
that
the
standards
were
met
in
this
case
because
the
commissioner
relied
upon
types
of
information
which
this
court
has
specifically
approved.
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
mr.
justice,
the
record
does
not
show
exactly
how
many
years
experience
agent
bender
had.
agent
bradley,
who
was
the
agent
who
dealt
with
the
informant
on
a
regular
basis
for
two
years
was
an
fbi
agent
with
18
years
experience.
and
i'm
not
sure
from
the
circumstances
whether
agent
bender
was
the
senior
agent
in
the
investigation,
he
certainly
seemed
to
be
in
charge
of
the
operation.
he
may
be
more
experienced
or
he
just
might
have
had
a
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
the
affiant
was
agent
bender.
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
i
suppose
that
that
would
be
the
operation
of
the
court's
decision.
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
--
reversing
--
reversing
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
i'm
sorry
sir?
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
thank
you
sir.
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
well
mr.
justice,
without
quivering
with
some
details,
i
tell
you
you're
talking
about
the
listing
at
the
bottom
of
page
27?
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
the
affidavit
did
not
--
i'm
not
quibbling
with
minor
details
in
it.
the
affidavit
did
not
say
that
the
apartment
was
not
petitioner's
home
but
it
can
reasonably
be
inferred,
we
believe
from
the
affidavit
that
it
was
not
his
home.
in
order
for
it
to
be
his
home,
he
somehow
would
have
had
to
have
gotten
over
the
east
st.
louis,
illinois
in
the
morning
then
to
come
back
through
that
way
and
the
agents
--
there
is
nothing
in
the
affidavit
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
that's
right.
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
yes
mr.
justice,
those
are
the
facts.
now
the
only
reason
that
i
was
hedging
is
that
the
affidavit
picked
him
up,
not
at
his
home
but
as
he
was
starting
across
the
east
side
of
the
bridge
into
st.
louis
in
the
morning
so
i
have,
in
order
to
defend
the
affidavit,
i
have
to
infer
that
the
apartment
f
was
not
home
but
that
his
home
was
where
he
came
from
in
the
morning
that
is
in
st.
louis,
illinois.
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
yes
mr.
justice,
that's
his
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
if
the
court
please,
i'd
like
to
try
to
tie
up
our
argument
with
respect
to
this
efficiency
of
the
affidavit
and
the
thrustworthiness
of
hearsay
by
referring
to
the
policies
annunciated
by
this
court
in
united
states
versus
ventresca.
the
court's
opinion,
written
by
mr.
justice
goldberg,
who
was
the
author
of
the
opinion
in
aguilar,
stated
that
where
an
affidavit
sets
out
facts
on
which
the
magistrate
can
make
an
independent
determination
of
the
grounds
for
a
search.
the
court
should
not
set
aside
the
magistrate's
finding
of
probable
cause
by
interpreting
the
affidavit
in
a
hyper
technical,
rather
than
a
common
sense
manner.
the
court
recognized
in
ventresca,
as
it
did
in
jones,
that
in
the
circumstances
in
which
affidavits
are
normally
drafted
by
policemen
in
the
midst
of
a
criminal
investigation
and
without
legal
assistance
if
the
affidavit
is
bound
to
leave
some
questions
unanswered.
the
affidavit
here
does
not
answer
all
the
questions
which
might
have
occurred
to
the
commissioner.
he
would
have
been
more
confident
in
his
finding
if
he
had
been
told
to
the
extent
to
which
the
informant
had
provided
accurate
information
of
the
past.
he
may
have
been
curious
as
to
whether
the
agents
had
been
able
to
determine
the
volume
of
calls
to
the
two
telephones
or
whether
there
really
was
a
grace
hagen
for
other
questions.
but
the
teaching
of
ventresca
is
that
the
affidavit's
failure
to
supply
certain
facts
is
fatal
only
if
it
undermines
the
reasonableness
of
the
inferences
which
may
be
drawn
from
the
facts
which
the
affidavit
does
continue,
or
put
it
another
way,
only
if
the
inference
is
rest
to
heavily
on
the
officer's
good
faith,
rather
than
the
magistrate's
own
independent
judgment.
the
critical
issue
in
this
case
is
the
thrustworthiness
of
the
hearsay.
the
corroborating
information
of
the
affidavit
provided
a
basis
in
which
the
commissioner
defined
the
hearsay
thrustworthy
without
relying
on
the
agent's
good
faith.
the
reasonableness
of
that
finding
is
not
undermined
by
the
defects
which
petitioner
alleges.
the
court
in
ventresca
also
cautioned
that
a
grudging
where
negative
attitude
by
reviewing
boards
to
award
warrants,
will
tend
to
discourage
police
officers
from
submitting
their
evidence
to
a
judicial
officer
before
acting.
the
concern
which
prompted
that
statement,
i
believe
is
illustrated
by
the
facts
of
this
case.
we
believe
that
agent
bender
did
have
at
least
a
reasonable
option
to
decide
whether
to
go
get
a
search
warrant
or
to
go
in
on
the
basis
of
the
information
he
had
without
a
warrant.
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
it
does.
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
the
affidavits
showed
no
surveillance
and
of
course
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
yes
sir
it
did.
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
no,
mr
justice.
i
believe
in
footnote
one
in
aguilar
said,
if
the
facts
and
results
of
such
a
surveillance
had
been
presented
to
the
magistrate,
it
would
have
been
a
different
case.
certainly,
in
so
far
as
any
indication
of
illegal
activity,
the
existence
of
a
surveillance
is
not
meaningful.
but
in
this
case,
the
existence
of
a
surveillance
is
meaningful,
particularly
with
reference
to
whether
the
informant
was
a
reliable
informant.
we
submit
that
the
commissioner
was
justified
in
relying
on
the
fact
that
on
the
basis
of
the
information
which
the
fbi
received
from
the
informant,
the
instituted
the
three
weeks
of
surveillance
involving
numerous
agents.
certainly
the
fbi
does
not
act
injudiciously
with
its
time.
and
this
is
an
indication
of
the
credence
which
they
placed
in
this
informant's
information.
thank
you.
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
that's
right
mr.
justice.
we
believe
that
that
certainly
is
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
the
affidavit
doesn't
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
but
we
think
that
the
affidavit
is
good
on
the
basis
of
the
whole
--
that
the
policy
is
of
the
entire
line
of
cases
in
this
area.
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
oh
yes,
it
would
certainly
overrule
draper.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
mr.
justice,
we
believe
that
the
commissioner
found
that
the
hearsay
information
was
thrustworthy
and
that
was
the
important
finding.
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
mr.
justice
i
don't
think
that
that
position
could
be
squared
with
aguilar.
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
i
don't
believe
that
that
position,
if
we
took
that
position.
i
don't
believe
we
could
square
it
with
aguilar.
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
well
i
really
think
that
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
well,
mr.
justice
in
the
particular
circumstances
in
which
the
particular
facts
of
aguilar,
that
is
a
case
where
the
reliability,
the
thrustworthiness
of
the
information
could
only
be
determined
by
two
things.
one
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
by
two
things.
one,
whether
it
came
from
a
reliable
person
and
two,
the
circumstances
in
which
that
person
obtained
the
information.
there
were
no
other
surveillance,
there
was
no
indication
of
knowledge
on
the
part
of
the
agents,
there
wasn't
anything
else.
and
i
think
that
the
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
because
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
well,
i
think
that
the
government
would
have
difficulty
maintaining
that
position
because
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
well
we
think
certainly
as
a
matter
of
common
sense
that
is
something
which
we
can
find
supportable
in
very,
very
many
cases.
but
the
giordenello-aguilar
line
of
cases
does
suggest
that
the
court
will
require
something
more
of
the
officers
than
merely
their
statement.
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
yes
mr.
justice
black,
at
least
in
a
circumstance
where
there
is
nothing
but
the
hearsay
information
which
was
the
particular
facts
in
aguilar
and
limiting
it
to
that.
at
least
in
that
case,
we
believe
that
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
well
i
know
it
sir,
i
mean
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
not
in
this
case,
no.
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
no,
no,
not
in
this
--
mr.
joseph
j.
connoly
no
it
was
not
hearsay.
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
