justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
don't
have
to
really
rely
on
this,
on
just
the
corroboration.
do
you
--
let's
assume
there
was
no
corroboration
applied
on
the
california
law
at
all,
that
an
accomplice
testimony
by
itself
isn't
there
to
convict.
the
fact
is
that
here
not
only
the
accomplice
testifies
to
identity
but
david
did,
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
the
jury
might
not
have
believed
the
accomplice
at
all
on
its
own
and
here
was
another
witness
who
testified
and
there's
some
constitutional
question
about
his
testimony.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
how
could
you
really
tell
that
the
question
be
whether
or
not
this
allegedly
tainted
testimony
of
david,
how
it
might
have
affected
the
jury?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
there
testimony
on
david's
direct
testimony?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
there
reference
to
the
line?
