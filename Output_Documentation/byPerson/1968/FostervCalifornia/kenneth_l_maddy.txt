mr.
kenneth
l.
maddy
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
before
this
court
--
this
matter
is
before
this
court
in
the
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
fifth
district
court
of
appeal
in
california
limited
to
the
question
of
whether
the
conduct
of
a
police
lineup
resulted
in
the
violation
of
petitioner's
constitutional
rights.
we
make
two
contentions.
first,
that
the
actions
of
the
police
in
the
conduct
of
two
lineups
and
a
personal
confrontation
between
the
petitioner,
walter
foster
and
a
witness
to
an
armed
robbery
unnecessarily
was
suggestive
and
conducive
to
irreparable
mistake
in
identification.
this
was
a
violation
of
mr.
foster's
rights
under
due
process
of
law.
the
second
point
is
that
the
personal
confrontation
between
mr.
foster
and
the
witness
violated
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
this
first
issue
was
based
on
the
holding
in
stovall
versus
denno
which
was
decided
last
year
by
this
court
with
the
other
lineup
decisions
of
united
states
versus
wade
and
gilbert
versus
california.
i
might
point
out
that
foster's
trial
and
the
decision
of
the
fifth
district
court
of
appeal,
the
original
trial
result
in
a
conviction
of
mr.
foster
and
the
fifth
district
court
of
appeal
in
california
affirmed
occurred
prior
to
the
decisions
in
stovall,
wade
and
gilbert.
to
properly
pursue
the
question
to
due
process
which
is
our
principal
contention,
i
wish
to
review
the
facts
of
the
case
with
particular
emphasis
on
the
events
and
circumstances
surrounding
the
lineups.
the
crime
charge
was
armed
robbery
of
a
western
union
office
in
fresno
in
january
1966.
the
victim
was
the
late
night
manager.
he
was
the
only
witness
to
the
robbery,
a
man
by
the
name
of
joseph
david.
he
testified
that
two
men
entered
the
office
shortly
after
midnight
on
january
25,
1966
and
after
appearing
to
make
out
a
moneygram,
approached
him
at
the
counter
with
guns
pointed
at
him
and
handed
him
a
holdup
note.
he
described
these
two
men
as
one
tall
individual
dressed
in
coveralls
with
a
hat
pulled
down
over
his
face
and
visible
under
the
coveralls
a
black
leather
jacket.
the
shorter
of
the
man
was
dressed
as
he
described
in
casual
clothes
and
a
suit
coat.
the
man
after
handing
the
holdup
note
to
him
required
him
to
open
the
safe
and
a
money
box
to
hand
the
money
to
the
taller
of
the
men
at
which
time
the
taller
men
left
the
office.
the
shorter
man
stayed
three
or
four
minutes
later
making
certain
threatening
gestures
to
the
witness.
without
relating
in
greater
detail
the
facts
of
the
crime,
i
wish
to
point
out
the
significance
of
certain
items.
first
of
all
that
the
short
time
that
the
tall
individual
as
indicated
in
the
record
was
in
the
office,
this
man
was
ultimately
described
or
stated
by
the
witness
to
be
walter
foster,
he
was
there
three
minutes
at
the
outside
perhaps
six
minutes.
part
of
that
time,
the
witness
was
facing
a
gun
held
by
this
tall
robber.
the
second
is
the
contradiction
in
the
description
of
the
dress
of
the
witness
of
the
shorter
man.
the
shorter
individual
ultimately
testified
at
time
of
trial.
and
third
was
the
fact
that
the
witness
changed
the
description
of
the
coloring
of
the
individual
--
the
tall
individual
at
the
time
of
trial
because
as
he
indicated
the
background
of
the
office
was
such
that
he
had
to
make
this
change
at
time
of
trial.
all
these
points
go
to
the
one
fact
that
the
witness
had
little
chance
for
observation
of
the
individuals
that
robbed
the
office
that
evening.
and
as
pointed
out
in
the
wade
decision,
mr.
david
was
a
likely
suspect
for
prompting
or
for
the
effects
of
an
improper
lineup.
i
mentioned
that
the
witness
ultimately
described
or
stated
that
the
tall
individual
was
walter
foster.
this
was
only
after
the
two
lineups
and
a
personal
confrontation
to
briefly
complete
the
background
of
the
case
j.
v.
clay,
testified
for
the
prosecution
at
the
time
of
trial.
he
indicated
that
he
was
the
shorter
man
that
robbed
the
western
union
office
that
night.
he
admitted
full
participation
however,
gave
certain
statements
in
the
basis
of
his
testimony
was
that
he
was
ordered
to
do
these
things
by
walter
foster
for
a
$50.00
sum.
he
fully
implicated
foster
and
a
john
henry
grice
as
a
third
party.
now
the
significance
of
clay's
testimony,
i
believe,
is
that
number
one,
he
contradicted
mr.
david
in
so
far
as
the
clothing
that
he
wore
himself
that
night
which
again
i
think
goes
to
the
point
that
the
lack
of
chance
for
observation.
the
second
point
is
that
he
gave
a
statement
one
day
after
the
robbery
to
the
police
implicating
foster
and
grice
in
this
robbery.
now,
i
wish
to
point
out
to
the
court
california
penal
code
section
1111
which
appears
and
i
think
appendix
b
of
the
respondent's
brief
requires
cooperation
of
an
accomplice's
testimony.
now
the
situation
has
placed
the
police
in
at
the
time
they
receive
the
statement
from
mr.
clay
was
that
they
had
one
man,
one
participant
in
the
robbery.
they
knew
who
the
second
one
was
or
they
felt
they
knew
who
the
second
one
was
and
as
we
point
out
in
the
brief,
mr.
foster
was
perhaps
a
likely
man
for
the
police,
he
had
a
previous
record.
the
problem
that
they
had
was
to
have
mr.
david
identify.
mr.
david,
the
lone
witnesses
identified
mr.
foster
as
not
unlike
the
situation
outlined
in
palmer
versus
payton
which
is
referred
to
by
the
court
in
stovall
versus
denno
where
they
talked
about
the
understandable
zeal
of
the
police.
they
believe
that
foster
was
their
man.
the
question
was
whether
the
witness
would
identify
him.
turning
to
the
lineups,
two
or
three
days
after
the
robbery
the
witness
was
called
to
the
police
station
to
view
a
lineup,
there
were
three
men
present.
the
witness
had
testified
that
the
one
man
was
a
taller
man,
approximately
six
foot
tall
who
was
in
the
lineup,
hatless
and
was
wearing
a
black
leather
jacket
similar
to
what
he
said
he
saw
under
the
coveralls
of
one
of
the
individuals
who
robbed
him.
the
other
two
men
were
shorter
men
five
foot
five,
five
foot
six,
they
were
both
required
to
wear
hats,
they
both
--
and
one
had
a
mustache.
evaluating
this
first
lineup
in
terms
of
the
considerations
outlined
in
wade,
we
would
have
to
say
that
foster,
number
one
was
the
lone
tall
suspect,
he
was
the
only
one
wearing
clothes
similar
to
that
which
was
allegedly
worn
by
one
of
the
men
that
robbed
the
western
union
office.
both
of
these
factors
are
things
that
were
outlined
in
wade,
are
part
of
the
problems
of
lineups,
problems
of
the
police
making
suggestive
factors
available
to
the
witness
at
the
time
of
the
lineup.
now
assuming
that
the
witness
gave
a
description
of
the
men
who
robbed
into
the
police
indicating
the
dress
that
they
wore,
this
first
lineup,
the
composition
of
it
clearly
made
foster's
stand
out,
yet
mr.
david
did
not
make
any
identification
at
that
time.
shortly,
after
the
lineup
or
at
the
time
of
the
lineup
he
requested
to
speak
to
the
individual
later
identified
as
mr.
foster,
this
was
the
personal
confrontation
i
spoke
of.
foster,
the
witness,
the
policeman
and
the
deputy
district
attorney
went
to
a
private
room
where
a
conversation
was
held
between
foster
and
david.
i'll
point
out
that
no
part
of
the
conversation
was
introduced
into
evidence
merely
the
fact
that
a
conversation
did
take
place.
now
we
analogize
this
to
the
widely
condemned
practice
of
the
single
suspect
confrontation.
palmer
versus
payton
and
justice
douglas
in
his
dissent
in
biggers
versus
tennessee
last
term,
elaborated
on
the
evils
of
the
single
suspect
confrontation.
it's
clear
that
the
witness
has
no
alternative
but
this
one
individual
that
he's
looking
at.
the
police
in
effect
are
saying
this
is
the
man.
the
second
aspect
related
to
our
particular
case
is
that
this
was
a
special
procedure
or
an
isolation
of
foster
versus
the
other
two
men
in
the
lineup.
they
handled
him
differently,
it's
very
hard
to
imagine
a
more
suggestive
situation
and
for
the
police
to
take
one
man
to
isolate
him
and
to
treat
him
differently
in
so
far
as
the
witnesses
are
concerned.
they
could
do
nothing
more
if
they
turned
around
and
said
this
is
the
man
we
believe
is
guilty
of
the
crime.
now,
no
further
court
the
case
of
crum
versus
beddow
(ph)
383
f.2d
which
is
outlined
--
i
think
is
listed
in
both
the
briefs
which
presented
a
similar
situation
in
so
far
as
isolating
an
individual
from
a
lineup
at
the
request
of
a
one
of
the
witnesses.
now,
the
court
there
looked
at
the
situation
and
stated
that
this
is
very
well
a
situation
that
violates
due
process
to
do
this,
to
pull
the
men
out,
to
suggest
to
the
man
--
the
witnesses
that
this
is
the
man.
the
distinguishing
feature
in
the
crum
(ph)
case
was
the
fact
that
there
the
witness
said,
“i'm
sure
this
is
the
man.”
the
court
pointed
out
that
if
this
had
not
--
if
the
positive
identification
had
not
been
made
by
the
witness
that
this
very
well
would
have
been
a
violation
of
due
process.
after
this
personal
confrontation,
the
witness
david
still
made
no
identification
of
foster.
ten
days
later
the
police
presented
the
crowning
blow,
they
called
mr.
david
back
to
a
second
lineup.
there
were
five
men
present.
they
were
all
dressed
similarly
in
jail
(inaudible).
yet,
the
only
man
that
was
present
in
the
second
lineup
who
had
been
seen
by
david
and
present
in
the
first
lineup
was
walter
foster.
we
ask
the
question
of
what
more
could
the
police
do?
to
suggest
and
to
implicate
foster
as
the
individual
that
they
were
asking
david
to
identify,
the
respondents
indicate
this
is
a
situation
where
we
just
had
a
super
cautious
witness.
i
think
the
record
clearly
shows
it's
a
situation
where
the
witness
could
not
identify
the
individual
who
was
there
until
forced
upon
him
by
suggestion.
now,
if
it
please
the
court
we
contend
that
each
step
taken
by
the
police
in
the
prosecution
can
be
criticized
as
suggestive
and
unfair
and
pointed
to
foster
but
more
important
is
the
cumulative
effect
of
each
of
these
three
steps.
they
made
adversely
impossible
for
the
witness
to
make
any
identification
other
than
that
of
foster.
i
think
that
one
other
aspect
of
this
is
that
question
of
the
necessity
or
as
pointed
out
in
stovall
versus
denno
by
justice
brennan
that
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
surrounding
the
lineup.
the
respondents,
it
seemed
to
tie
this
in
this
question
of
totality
of
the
circumstances
with
the
harmless
error
rule
and
ask
the
court
in
our
brief
to
review
all
the
facts
of
the
case
before
deciding
the
due
process
issue.
we
dispute
this.
we
interpret
this
reference
to
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
to
mean
the
events
and
circumstances
surrounding
the
lineup
alone.
what
prompted
the
action
of
the
police
to
bring
about
the
lineup
in
the
manner
in
which
they
did
in
stovall
versus
denno
there
was
a
dying
witness
that
brought
about
the
single
suspect
confrontation.
that
single
suspect
confrontation
was
criticized
but
it
was
said
that
under
all
the
circumstances
the
case
that
this
was
not
a
denial
of
due
process.
in
the
unites
states
versus
simmons
which
was
decided
last
term
there
were
the
suspects
where
at
large
and
it
was
indicated
that
there
was
a
need
for
identification
immediately
with
use
of
photographs,
again,
the
totality
of
the
circumstances.
people
versus
ford
and
state
versus
sears
which
are
cited
in
respondent's
briefs
where
situations
of
on
the
spot
apprehensions
of
individual
suspected
a
crime
and
on
the
spot
identifications
which
again
are
situations
i
believe
that
are
involved
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
surrounding
the
lineup
alone.
necessary
procedures
which
prevented
a
traditional
lineup
but
when
considers
a
whole
--
when
the
lineups
are
considered
as
a
whole
they
were
not
a
violation
of
due
process.
i
believe
that
in
our
case
we
have
none
of
those
circumstances,
there
are
no
imperative
circumstances.
foster
was
under
arrest.
there
was
no
necessity
to
proceed
or
to
deviate
from
established
procedures.
no
excuse.
mr.
kenneth
l.
maddy
only
justice
harlan
that
the
witness
did
not
at
the
time
he
testified
a
trial,
properly
identified
mr.
clay's
clothing
that
he
wore
that
night.
there
was
a
contradiction
between
clay
and
the
man.
there
was
no
testimony
concerning
whether
the
witness
was
ever
required
to
identify
clay.
mr.
kenneth
l.
maddy
no,
no
there
was
no
question
as
far
as
clay,
at
the
time
of
trial,
clay
said,
“this
is
the
man
that
was
with
me.”
he
also
said
that
john
henry
grice
was
with
him
that
evening.
mr.
kenneth
l.
maddy
the
identification
procedures
were
brought
out
in
cross-examination
which
i
think
is
one
of
the
real
dangers
in
the
lineup
situation,
because
the
witness
himself
has
made
his
identification
sometime
prior.
this
was
a
case
with
david.
he
had
made
his
identification,
it
took
him
as
he
said,
well,
it
took
the
two
lineups
and
the
personal
confrontation
before
he
ever
said
that
walter
foster
was
the
man
that
robbed
him,
yet
at
the
time
of
trial
when
he
was
testifying,
i
think
it's
page
27
of
the
brief.
he
embellished
this,
he
said
i
made
hard
looks
at
this
man,
i
impressed
in
my
memory
about
so
that
i
would
always
remember
them.
this
again
is
one
of
the
dangers
so
that
it
was
necessary
on
cross-examination
to
bring
out
the
lineups
and
the
lineups
were
presented
to
the
jury
to
a
limited
extent.
mr.
kenneth
l.
maddy
it's
our
position
--
mr.
kenneth
l.
maddy
that's
correct
it's
our
position
that
the
collaborating
–-
that
clay
may
never
have
testified
the
collaborating
testimony
was
required
and
that
david
presented
them.
mr.
kenneth
l.
maddy
that's
correct.
we
feel
that
the
identification
of
david
was
in
effect
tainted
that
was
suggested
by
the
police
that
it
was
made
only
after
all
the
suggestion,
and
that
we
feel
despite
whatever
evidence
was
introduced
by
clay
or
by
whatever
by
the
prosecution.
mr.
kenneth
l.
maddy
that's
correct.
mr.
kenneth
l.
maddy
that's
correct.
mr.
kenneth
l.
maddy
that's
correct
your
honor.
we
think
that's
significant
in
so
far
as
in
we're
going
to
point
that
out
as
far
as
the
question
of
harmless
error.
mr.
kenneth
l.
maddy
this
is
the
point
i
was
making
concerning
the
harmless
error
rule
that
once
that
we
feel
that
this
court
must
look
at
the
procedures
set
forth
in
so
far
as
the
events
and
circumstances
of
alignment
to
decide
whether
or
not
that
the
lineups
were
so
suggestive
and
as
we
said
conducive
to
mistaken
identification
that
they
violated
foster's
rights
the
due
process
of
law.
once
that
point
is
considered,
we
feel
that
that
is
a
basic
right
as
indicated
in
chapman
versus
california
and
would
require
a
reversal
at
that
point.
however,
in
the
alternative
if
the
court
feels
that
the
rest
of
the
facts
of
the
case
can
be
looked
at
defying
to
determine
whether
that
denial
of
due
process
in
this
case
was
contributed
to
the
conviction
of
foster
then
we
point
to
the
fact
that
number
one,
under
the
law
in
the
state
of
california,
perhaps
clay's
testimony
would
never
have
been
admissible,
thus,
the
state
would
have
had
no
case
at
that
point.
and
the
second
point
that
we
make
is
the
fact
that
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
testimony
of
david
contributed
to
the
conviction
we
pointed
the
fact
that
john
henry
grice
who
was
as
fully
implicated
in
this
crime
and
as
foster
was
by
clay,
the
only
difference
between
the
case
presented
between
grice
and
foster
was
the
witness
--
eyewitness
identification
and
he
was
acquitted.
mr.
kenneth
l.
maddy
that's
correct.
mr.
kenneth
l.
maddy
that's
correct.
mr.
kenneth
l.
maddy
on
the
part
of
mr.
grice.
mr.
kenneth
l.
maddy
to
review
the
record
i
seriously
question
where
there
was
any
corroboration,
the
court
at
that
time
allowed
the
matter
to
proceed
to
jury,
that's
correct
and
in
the
opinion
--
mr.
kenneth
l.
maddy
at
that
time
of
the
trial
and
the
review
of
the
record
i
would
say
that
the
trial
court
determined
at
that
time
that
there
was
some
corroboration
for
mr.
grice.
mr.
kenneth
l.
maddy
if
the
court
reviews
the
record
like
i
have,
i
don't
see
it.
i
don't
believe
it's
there.
i
don't
believe
that
grice
is
a
--
the
question
of
grice
being
in
this
case
should
have
ever
gone
at
the
jury.
that's
my
--
mr.
kenneth
l.
maddy
that's
correct.
mr.
kenneth
l.
maddy
that's
our
position
that
the
testimony
of
david
--
mr.
kenneth
l.
maddy
well,
our
position
is
that
if
when
the
jury
shouldn't
have
heard
it
at
all.
our
position
is,
i
believe
that
we're
understanding
each
other
justice
white,
i
believe
that
the
point
is
that
if
the
testimony
of
david
was
tainted
by
this
lineups
that
was
so
improperly
conducted
then
his
testimony
should
be
excluded.
that
was
a
violation
to
due
process
that
it
requires
reversal
despite
the
only
point
that
we
make
concerning
grice
and
the
penal
code
section
1111
where
it
applies,
i
believe,
is
involved
with
the
harmless
error
rule
which
is
raised
by
respondent
and
i
feel
that
the
basic
question
is
whether
or
not
these
lineups
and
the
procedures
followed
by
the
police
as
we've
outlined
violated
due
process.
mr.
kenneth
l.
maddy
the
conduct
of
the
police
in
these
lineups,
justice
black.
mr.
kenneth
l.
maddy
no,
our
basic
premise
is
that
the
conduct
of
the
police
in
the
lineups,
in
the
two
lineups
and
the
suggestions
that
were
implied
in
the
two
lineups
violated
the
due
process
as
indicated
in
stovall
versus
denno.
the
corroboration
only
we
feel
comes
in
to
out
of
the
question
of
what
happened
to
john
henry
grice,
the
co-defendant
and
the
question
of
corroboration
comes
in
to
what
we
feel
if
at
all
if
this
court
feels
that
the
harmless
error
may
apply
in
this
case.
mr.
kenneth
l.
maddy
yes.
mr.
kenneth
l.
maddy
yes,
at
page
33
of
the
record,
the
prosecution
did
bring
out
from
david
the
fact
that
he
had
viewed
two
lineups
and
that
he
had
made
an
identification
following
the
second
lineup.
the
events
and
circumstances
surrounding
the
lineups
in
the
confrontation
came
about
on
cross-examination.
mr.
kenneth
l.
maddy
it
was
merely
indicated
in
the
record
that
the
witness,
david
wished
to
speak
to
the
suspect,
foster.
mr.
kenneth
l.
maddy
nothing
more,
what
was
said
at
the
confrontation
was
not
brought
out.
mr.
kenneth
l.
maddy
there
were
three
in
that
first
lineup.
mr.
kenneth
l.
maddy
that's
correct.
mr.
kenneth
l.
maddy
that's
correct.
mr.
kenneth
l.
maddy
it
was
not
brought
out
and
it's
not
in
the
record
what
they
talked
about.
it
was
merely
that
they
had
a
conversation
in
the
presence
of
the
district
attorney
and
in
the
presence
of
the
present
of
police
officer
in
a
private
room,
their
conversation
took
place.
mr.
kenneth
l.
maddy
david
testified
that
the
taller
individual
uttered
approximately
four
phrases.
i
think
comprising
18
words
and
he
did
make
some
reference
in
the
testimony
as
to
the
softness
of
the
voice.
mr.
kenneth
l.
maddy
there
is
a
reference
in
the
record
that
david
indicated
that
“i
thought
--
mr.
kenneth
l.
maddy
“i
thought
it
was
the
man.”
mr.
kenneth
l.
maddy
he
wanted
to
talk
to
him,
that's
correct.
the
point
is
that
he
did
not
make
and
our
point
is
that
he
did
not
make
a
positive
identification
that
he
said,
“i
thought
it
is
the
man”
and
we
point
to
the
fact
that
the
composition
of
the
first
lineup
which
could
only
bring
about
one
thing
and
that
was
that
the
individual
would
think
that
it
was
the
man
he
was
taller,
he
was
the
lone
tall
suspect,
and
he
was
dressed
similar
to
the
man
described
by
david
who
robbed
him.
we
suggest
to
that
suggestion
in
itself
brought
about
the
personal
confrontation.
we
have
indicated
in
our
--
mr.
kenneth
l.
maddy
he
was
unable
to
make
an
identification.
“i
was
not
--
mr.
kenneth
l.
maddy
in
the
record?
yes.
the
exact
page,
he
says
“i
was”
--
i
don't
have
it
right
of
hand.
he
says,
“i
was
not
sure.
i
could
not
make
a
positive
identification.”
it
was
his
answer
on
cross-examination
and
again
the
second
lineup
was
10
days
later.
now,
we
have
made
a
second
contention
concerning
a
violation
of
privilege
against
self-incrimination,
mindful
of
the
court's
decisions
in
wade
also
we
know
that
the
dissents
in
wade.
we
believe
this
case
may
present
a
factual
situation
that
the
court
can
again
review,
voice
identification
compelling
a
person
to
speak
of
the
lineup
in
relation
to
fifth
amendment.
mr.
kenneth
l.
maddy
there
were
no
statements,
justice
harlan,
used.
it
was
merely
the
fact,
it
is
in
the
record
and
it
is
clear
in
the
record
that
a
“conversation”
took
place
and
we
ask
the
court
if
there
are
certain
considerations
and
points
that
we've
made
in
our
brief
concerning
this
point
which
we
believe
are
clear,
i
believe
that
there
are
certainly
theories
whether
you
use
an
active
volitional
versus
passive
theory
or
to
this
effect
that
requiring
a
man
to
speak
is
sufficient
to
violate
his
rights,
we
feel
that
the
--
mr.
kenneth
l.
maddy
yes,
there
was
nothing
in
the
direct
examination
as
to
that
it
was
brought
out
on
cross-examination
the
fact
that
they
were
unable
--
he
was
unable
after
the
conference
to
make
an
identification.
mr.
kenneth
l.
maddy
that's
correct.
we
will
reserve
a
moment
or
two
if
the
court
please
to
for
rebuttal.
we
respectfully
request
and
submit
that
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
these
lineups
and
the
personal
confrontation
were
such
that
they
violated
mr.
foster's
rights
of
due
process
of
law
and
we
respectfully
request
the
matter
of
the
fifth
amendment
rights
to
be
reviewed
also.
mr.
kenneth
l.
maddy
may
it
please
the
court,
mr.
chief
justice.
just
one
or
two
comments
on
the
statements
of
ms.
maier.
first
of
all,
an
answer
to
the
two
points
she
made
concerning
discovery
rules
in
california
and
concerning
what
mr.
david,
the
witness
said
at
the
time
of
trial.
i
think
that
they're
both
significant
because
they
both
point
out
to
the
real
dangers
involve
with
lineup
situations.
first
of
all,
discovery
is
not
going
to
do
the
attorney
any
good
except
in
the
manner
that
he
can
bring
things
out
on
cross-examination.
as
an
attorney,
you're
face
with
the
problem
of
how
far
are
you
going
to
push
on
cross-examination
because
your
first
intent
at
that
time
is
to
win
your
case
if
you
can
at
the
time
of
trial.
you
can't
try
the
case
and
hope
that
or
the
prospect
as
mr.
foster
to
sit
in
false
imprisonment
for
two
years,
waiting
for
a
court
such
as
this
to
change
the
decision
based
on
the
records
you
established.
in
other
words,
i
think
this
is
the
danger
the
prosecution
is
not
going
to
bring
out
all
the
events
of
the
lineup.
they're
going
to
put
a
witness
on
the
stand
who
says,
as
mr.
david
did,
“i'm
positively
sure
that
that's
the
man
as
i
see
him
sitting
there
today.”
the
point
is
that
he
made
that
determination
based
on
the
improper
conduct
of
the
lineup
procedures
before
he
got
to
court.
i
think
the
majority
of
the
cases
do
not
show
that
the
prosecution
goes
into
prior
lineups
unless
the
individual,
the
witnesses
cannot
say
for
sure
of
the
time
of
trial.
he
has
to
refer
that
to
the
lineups.
so
i
think
that
the
two
points
that
the
respondent
makes
our
both
pointing
out
dangers
involved
with
the
lineup
situations.
the
second
point,
i
want
to
make
is
that
ms.
maier
made
to
reference
certain
factors
that
should
be
considered
by
the
court
in
reviewing
the
lineups.
she
mentioned,
had
the
witness
seen
the
man
before?
was
he
seen
in
the
custody
of
police
before?
did
he
know
anyone
in
the
lineup?
now,
we
feel
and
i
contend
that
the
second
lineup
is
the
most
important
lineup
here
because
all
of
the
things
that
she
mentioned
were
violated
in
the
second
lineup.
as
i
said
that's
crowning
blow
as
far
as
the
composition
of
the
second
lineup
was
concern
it
could
have
been
perfect
as
far
as
height
and
appearances
of
the
individuals
but
the
significant
point
was
that
walter
foster
was
the
only
man
in
that
second
lineup
that
was
in
the
first
lineup.
and
as
i
say,
there
could
not
been
anymore
suggested
situation
than
that
presented
by
the
prosecution
at
that
second
lineup.
mr.
kenneth
l.
maddy
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
before
this
court
--
this
matter
is
before
this
court
in
the
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
fifth
district
court
of
appeal
in
california
limited
to
the
question
of
whether
the
conduct
of
a
police
lineup
resulted
in
the
violation
of
petitioner's
constitutional
rights.
we
make
two
contentions.
first,
that
the
actions
of
the
police
in
the
conduct
of
two
lineups
and
a
personal
confrontation
between
the
petitioner,
walter
foster
and
a
witness
to
an
armed
robbery
unnecessarily
was
suggestive
and
conducive
to
irreparable
mistake
in
identification.
this
was
a
violation
of
mr.
foster's
rights
under
due
process
of
law.
the
second
point
is
that
the
personal
confrontation
between
mr.
foster
and
the
witness
violated
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
this
first
issue
was
based
on
the
holding
in
stovall
versus
denno
which
was
decided
last
year
by
this
court
with
the
other
lineup
decisions
of
united
states
versus
wade
and
gilbert
versus
california.
i
might
point
out
that
foster's
trial
and
the
decision
of
the
fifth
district
court
of
appeal,
the
original
trial
result
in
a
conviction
of
mr.
foster
and
the
fifth
district
court
of
appeal
in
california
affirmed
occurred
prior
to
the
decisions
in
stovall,
wade
and
gilbert.
to
properly
pursue
the
question
to
due
process
which
is
our
principal
contention,
i
wish
to
review
the
facts
of
the
case
with
particular
emphasis
on
the
events
and
circumstances
surrounding
the
lineups.
the
crime
charge
was
armed
robbery
of
a
western
union
office
in
fresno
in
january
1966.
the
victim
was
the
late
night
manager.
he
was
the
only
witness
to
the
robbery,
a
man
by
the
name
of
joseph
david.
he
testified
that
two
men
entered
the
office
shortly
after
midnight
on
january
25,
1966
and
after
appearing
to
make
out
a
moneygram,
approached
him
at
the
counter
with
guns
pointed
at
him
and
handed
him
a
holdup
note.
he
described
these
two
men
as
one
tall
individual
dressed
in
coveralls
with
a
hat
pulled
down
over
his
face
and
visible
under
the
coveralls
a
black
leather
jacket.
the
shorter
of
the
man
was
dressed
as
he
described
in
casual
clothes
and
a
suit
coat.
the
man
after
handing
the
holdup
note
to
him
required
him
to
open
the
safe
and
a
money
box
to
hand
the
money
to
the
taller
of
the
men
at
which
time
the
taller
men
left
the
office.
the
shorter
man
stayed
three
or
four
minutes
later
making
certain
threatening
gestures
to
the
witness.
without
relating
in
greater
detail
the
facts
of
the
crime,
i
wish
to
point
out
the
significance
of
certain
items.
first
of
all
that
the
short
time
that
the
tall
individual
as
indicated
in
the
record
was
in
the
office,
this
man
was
ultimately
described
or
stated
by
the
witness
to
be
walter
foster,
he
was
there
three
minutes
at
the
outside
perhaps
six
minutes.
part
of
that
time,
the
witness
was
facing
a
gun
held
by
this
tall
robber.
the
second
is
the
contradiction
in
the
description
of
the
dress
of
the
witness
of
the
shorter
man.
the
shorter
individual
ultimately
testified
at
time
of
trial.
and
third
was
the
fact
that
the
witness
changed
the
description
of
the
coloring
of
the
individual
--
the
tall
individual
at
the
time
of
trial
because
as
he
indicated
the
background
of
the
office
was
such
that
he
had
to
make
this
change
at
time
of
trial.
all
these
points
go
to
the
one
fact
that
the
witness
had
little
chance
for
observation
of
the
individuals
that
robbed
the
office
that
evening.
and
as
pointed
out
in
the
wade
decision,
mr.
david
was
a
likely
suspect
for
prompting
or
for
the
effects
of
an
improper
lineup.
i
mentioned
that
the
witness
ultimately
described
or
stated
that
the
tall
individual
was
walter
foster.
this
was
only
after
the
two
lineups
and
a
personal
confrontation
to
briefly
complete
the
background
of
the
case
j.
v.
clay,
testified
for
the
prosecution
at
the
time
of
trial.
he
indicated
that
he
was
the
shorter
man
that
robbed
the
western
union
office
that
night.
he
admitted
full
participation
however,
gave
certain
statements
in
the
basis
of
his
testimony
was
that
he
was
ordered
to
do
these
things
by
walter
foster
for
a
$50.00
sum.
he
fully
implicated
foster
and
a
john
henry
grice
as
a
third
party.
now
the
significance
of
clay's
testimony,
i
believe,
is
that
number
one,
he
contradicted
mr.
david
in
so
far
as
the
clothing
that
he
wore
himself
that
night
which
again
i
think
goes
to
the
point
that
the
lack
of
chance
for
observation.
the
second
point
is
that
he
gave
a
statement
one
day
after
the
robbery
to
the
police
implicating
foster
and
grice
in
this
robbery.
now,
i
wish
to
point
out
to
the
court
california
penal
code
section
1111
which
appears
and
i
think
appendix
b
of
the
respondent's
brief
requires
cooperation
of
an
accomplice's
testimony.
now
the
situation
has
placed
the
police
in
at
the
time
they
receive
the
statement
from
mr.
clay
was
that
they
had
one
man,
one
participant
in
the
robbery.
they
knew
who
the
second
one
was
or
they
felt
they
knew
who
the
second
one
was
and
as
we
point
out
in
the
brief,
mr.
foster
was
perhaps
a
likely
man
for
the
police,
he
had
a
previous
record.
the
problem
that
they
had
was
to
have
mr.
david
identify.
mr.
david,
the
lone
witnesses
identified
mr.
foster
as
not
unlike
the
situation
outlined
in
palmer
versus
payton
which
is
referred
to
by
the
court
in
stovall
versus
denno
where
they
talked
about
the
understandable
zeal
of
the
police.
they
believe
that
foster
was
their
man.
the
question
was
whether
the
witness
would
identify
him.
turning
to
the
lineups,
two
or
three
days
after
the
robbery
the
witness
was
called
to
the
police
station
to
view
a
lineup,
there
were
three
men
present.
the
witness
had
testified
that
the
one
man
was
a
taller
man,
approximately
six
foot
tall
who
was
in
the
lineup,
hatless
and
was
wearing
a
black
leather
jacket
similar
to
what
he
said
he
saw
under
the
coveralls
of
one
of
the
individuals
who
robbed
him.
the
other
two
men
were
shorter
men
five
foot
five,
five
foot
six,
they
were
both
required
to
wear
hats,
they
both
--
and
one
had
a
mustache.
evaluating
this
first
lineup
in
terms
of
the
considerations
outlined
in
wade,
we
would
have
to
say
that
foster,
number
one
was
the
lone
tall
suspect,
he
was
the
only
one
wearing
clothes
similar
to
that
which
was
allegedly
worn
by
one
of
the
men
that
robbed
the
western
union
office.
both
of
these
factors
are
things
that
were
outlined
in
wade,
are
part
of
the
problems
of
lineups,
problems
of
the
police
making
suggestive
factors
available
to
the
witness
at
the
time
of
the
lineup.
now
assuming
that
the
witness
gave
a
description
of
the
men
who
robbed
into
the
police
indicating
the
dress
that
they
wore,
this
first
lineup,
the
composition
of
it
clearly
made
foster's
stand
out,
yet
mr.
david
did
not
make
any
identification
at
that
time.
shortly,
after
the
lineup
or
at
the
time
of
the
lineup
he
requested
to
speak
to
the
individual
later
identified
as
mr.
foster,
this
was
the
personal
confrontation
i
spoke
of.
foster,
the
witness,
the
policeman
and
the
deputy
district
attorney
went
to
a
private
room
where
a
conversation
was
held
between
foster
and
david.
i'll
point
out
that
no
part
of
the
conversation
was
introduced
into
evidence
merely
the
fact
that
a
conversation
did
take
place.
now
we
analogize
this
to
the
widely
condemned
practice
of
the
single
suspect
confrontation.
palmer
versus
payton
and
justice
douglas
in
his
dissent
in
biggers
versus
tennessee
last
term,
elaborated
on
the
evils
of
the
single
suspect
confrontation.
it's
clear
that
the
witness
has
no
alternative
but
this
one
individual
that
he's
looking
at.
the
police
in
effect
are
saying
this
is
the
man.
the
second
aspect
related
to
our
particular
case
is
that
this
was
a
special
procedure
or
an
isolation
of
foster
versus
the
other
two
men
in
the
lineup.
they
handled
him
differently,
it's
very
hard
to
imagine
a
more
suggestive
situation
and
for
the
police
to
take
one
man
to
isolate
him
and
to
treat
him
differently
in
so
far
as
the
witnesses
are
concerned.
they
could
do
nothing
more
if
they
turned
around
and
said
this
is
the
man
we
believe
is
guilty
of
the
crime.
now,
no
further
court
the
case
of
crum
versus
beddow
(ph)
383
f.2d
which
is
outlined
--
i
think
is
listed
in
both
the
briefs
which
presented
a
similar
situation
in
so
far
as
isolating
an
individual
from
a
lineup
at
the
request
of
a
one
of
the
witnesses.
now,
the
court
there
looked
at
the
situation
and
stated
that
this
is
very
well
a
situation
that
violates
due
process
to
do
this,
to
pull
the
men
out,
to
suggest
to
the
man
--
the
witnesses
that
this
is
the
man.
the
distinguishing
feature
in
the
crum
(ph)
case
was
the
fact
that
there
the
witness
said,
“i'm
sure
this
is
the
man.”
the
court
pointed
out
that
if
this
had
not
--
if
the
positive
identification
had
not
been
made
by
the
witness
that
this
very
well
would
have
been
a
violation
of
due
process.
after
this
personal
confrontation,
the
witness
david
still
made
no
identification
of
foster.
ten
days
later
the
police
presented
the
crowning
blow,
they
called
mr.
david
back
to
a
second
lineup.
there
were
five
men
present.
they
were
all
dressed
similarly
in
jail
(inaudible).
yet,
the
only
man
that
was
present
in
the
second
lineup
who
had
been
seen
by
david
and
present
in
the
first
lineup
was
walter
foster.
we
ask
the
question
of
what
more
could
the
police
do?
to
suggest
and
to
implicate
foster
as
the
individual
that
they
were
asking
david
to
identify,
the
respondents
indicate
this
is
a
situation
where
we
just
had
a
super
cautious
witness.
i
think
the
record
clearly
shows
it's
a
situation
where
the
witness
could
not
identify
the
individual
who
was
there
until
forced
upon
him
by
suggestion.
now,
if
it
please
the
court
we
contend
that
each
step
taken
by
the
police
in
the
prosecution
can
be
criticized
as
suggestive
and
unfair
and
pointed
to
foster
but
more
important
is
the
cumulative
effect
of
each
of
these
three
steps.
they
made
adversely
impossible
for
the
witness
to
make
any
identification
other
than
that
of
foster.
i
think
that
one
other
aspect
of
this
is
that
question
of
the
necessity
or
as
pointed
out
in
stovall
versus
denno
by
justice
brennan
that
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
surrounding
the
lineup.
the
respondents,
it
seemed
to
tie
this
in
this
question
of
totality
of
the
circumstances
with
the
harmless
error
rule
and
ask
the
court
in
our
brief
to
review
all
the
facts
of
the
case
before
deciding
the
due
process
issue.
we
dispute
this.
we
interpret
this
reference
to
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
to
mean
the
events
and
circumstances
surrounding
the
lineup
alone.
what
prompted
the
action
of
the
police
to
bring
about
the
lineup
in
the
manner
in
which
they
did
in
stovall
versus
denno
there
was
a
dying
witness
that
brought
about
the
single
suspect
confrontation.
that
single
suspect
confrontation
was
criticized
but
it
was
said
that
under
all
the
circumstances
the
case
that
this
was
not
a
denial
of
due
process.
in
the
unites
states
versus
simmons
which
was
decided
last
term
there
were
the
suspects
where
at
large
and
it
was
indicated
that
there
was
a
need
for
identification
immediately
with
use
of
photographs,
again,
the
totality
of
the
circumstances.
people
versus
ford
and
state
versus
sears
which
are
cited
in
respondent's
briefs
where
situations
of
on
the
spot
apprehensions
of
individual
suspected
a
crime
and
on
the
spot
identifications
which
again
are
situations
i
believe
that
are
involved
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
surrounding
the
lineup
alone.
necessary
procedures
which
prevented
a
traditional
lineup
but
when
considers
a
whole
--
when
the
lineups
are
considered
as
a
whole
they
were
not
a
violation
of
due
process.
i
believe
that
in
our
case
we
have
none
of
those
circumstances,
there
are
no
imperative
circumstances.
foster
was
under
arrest.
there
was
no
necessity
to
proceed
or
to
deviate
from
established
procedures.
no
excuse.
mr.
kenneth
l.
maddy
only
justice
harlan
that
the
witness
did
not
at
the
time
he
testified
a
trial,
properly
identified
mr.
clay's
clothing
that
he
wore
that
night.
there
was
a
contradiction
between
clay
and
the
man.
there
was
no
testimony
concerning
whether
the
witness
was
ever
required
to
identify
clay.
mr.
kenneth
l.
maddy
no,
no
there
was
no
question
as
far
as
clay,
at
the
time
of
trial,
clay
said,
“this
is
the
man
that
was
with
me.”
he
also
said
that
john
henry
grice
was
with
him
that
evening.
mr.
kenneth
l.
maddy
the
identification
procedures
were
brought
out
in
cross-examination
which
i
think
is
one
of
the
real
dangers
in
the
lineup
situation,
because
the
witness
himself
has
made
his
identification
sometime
prior.
this
was
a
case
with
david.
he
had
made
his
identification,
it
took
him
as
he
said,
well,
it
took
the
two
lineups
and
the
personal
confrontation
before
he
ever
said
that
walter
foster
was
the
man
that
robbed
him,
yet
at
the
time
of
trial
when
he
was
testifying,
i
think
it's
page
27
of
the
brief.
he
embellished
this,
he
said
i
made
hard
looks
at
this
man,
i
impressed
in
my
memory
about
so
that
i
would
always
remember
them.
this
again
is
one
of
the
dangers
so
that
it
was
necessary
on
cross-examination
to
bring
out
the
lineups
and
the
lineups
were
presented
to
the
jury
to
a
limited
extent.
mr.
kenneth
l.
maddy
it's
our
position
--
mr.
kenneth
l.
maddy
that's
correct
it's
our
position
that
the
collaborating
–-
that
clay
may
never
have
testified
the
collaborating
testimony
was
required
and
that
david
presented
them.
mr.
kenneth
l.
maddy
that's
correct.
we
feel
that
the
identification
of
david
was
in
effect
tainted
that
was
suggested
by
the
police
that
it
was
made
only
after
all
the
suggestion,
and
that
we
feel
despite
whatever
evidence
was
introduced
by
clay
or
by
whatever
by
the
prosecution.
mr.
kenneth
l.
maddy
that's
correct.
mr.
kenneth
l.
maddy
that's
correct.
mr.
kenneth
l.
maddy
that's
correct
your
honor.
we
think
that's
significant
in
so
far
as
in
we're
going
to
point
that
out
as
far
as
the
question
of
harmless
error.
mr.
kenneth
l.
maddy
this
is
the
point
i
was
making
concerning
the
harmless
error
rule
that
once
that
we
feel
that
this
court
must
look
at
the
procedures
set
forth
in
so
far
as
the
events
and
circumstances
of
alignment
to
decide
whether
or
not
that
the
lineups
were
so
suggestive
and
as
we
said
conducive
to
mistaken
identification
that
they
violated
foster's
rights
the
due
process
of
law.
once
that
point
is
considered,
we
feel
that
that
is
a
basic
right
as
indicated
in
chapman
versus
california
and
would
require
a
reversal
at
that
point.
however,
in
the
alternative
if
the
court
feels
that
the
rest
of
the
facts
of
the
case
can
be
looked
at
defying
to
determine
whether
that
denial
of
due
process
in
this
case
was
contributed
to
the
conviction
of
foster
then
we
point
to
the
fact
that
number
one,
under
the
law
in
the
state
of
california,
perhaps
clay's
testimony
would
never
have
been
admissible,
thus,
the
state
would
have
had
no
case
at
that
point.
and
the
second
point
that
we
make
is
the
fact
that
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
testimony
of
david
contributed
to
the
conviction
we
pointed
the
fact
that
john
henry
grice
who
was
as
fully
implicated
in
this
crime
and
as
foster
was
by
clay,
the
only
difference
between
the
case
presented
between
grice
and
foster
was
the
witness
--
eyewitness
identification
and
he
was
acquitted.
mr.
kenneth
l.
maddy
that's
correct.
mr.
kenneth
l.
maddy
that's
correct.
mr.
kenneth
l.
maddy
on
the
part
of
mr.
grice.
mr.
kenneth
l.
maddy
to
review
the
record
i
seriously
question
where
there
was
any
corroboration,
the
court
at
that
time
allowed
the
matter
to
proceed
to
jury,
that's
correct
and
in
the
opinion
--
mr.
kenneth
l.
maddy
at
that
time
of
the
trial
and
the
review
of
the
record
i
would
say
that
the
trial
court
determined
at
that
time
that
there
was
some
corroboration
for
mr.
grice.
mr.
kenneth
l.
maddy
if
the
court
reviews
the
record
like
i
have,
i
don't
see
it.
i
don't
believe
it's
there.
i
don't
believe
that
grice
is
a
--
the
question
of
grice
being
in
this
case
should
have
ever
gone
at
the
jury.
that's
my
--
mr.
kenneth
l.
maddy
that's
correct.
mr.
kenneth
l.
maddy
that's
our
position
that
the
testimony
of
david
--
mr.
kenneth
l.
maddy
well,
our
position
is
that
if
when
the
jury
shouldn't
have
heard
it
at
all.
our
position
is,
i
believe
that
we're
understanding
each
other
justice
white,
i
believe
that
the
point
is
that
if
the
testimony
of
david
was
tainted
by
this
lineups
that
was
so
improperly
conducted
then
his
testimony
should
be
excluded.
that
was
a
violation
to
due
process
that
it
requires
reversal
despite
the
only
point
that
we
make
concerning
grice
and
the
penal
code
section
1111
where
it
applies,
i
believe,
is
involved
with
the
harmless
error
rule
which
is
raised
by
respondent
and
i
feel
that
the
basic
question
is
whether
or
not
these
lineups
and
the
procedures
followed
by
the
police
as
we've
outlined
violated
due
process.
mr.
kenneth
l.
maddy
the
conduct
of
the
police
in
these
lineups,
justice
black.
mr.
kenneth
l.
maddy
no,
our
basic
premise
is
that
the
conduct
of
the
police
in
the
lineups,
in
the
two
lineups
and
the
suggestions
that
were
implied
in
the
two
lineups
violated
the
due
process
as
indicated
in
stovall
versus
denno.
the
corroboration
only
we
feel
comes
in
to
out
of
the
question
of
what
happened
to
john
henry
grice,
the
co-defendant
and
the
question
of
corroboration
comes
in
to
what
we
feel
if
at
all
if
this
court
feels
that
the
harmless
error
may
apply
in
this
case.
mr.
kenneth
l.
maddy
yes.
mr.
kenneth
l.
maddy
yes,
at
page
33
of
the
record,
the
prosecution
did
bring
out
from
david
the
fact
that
he
had
viewed
two
lineups
and
that
he
had
made
an
identification
following
the
second
lineup.
the
events
and
circumstances
surrounding
the
lineups
in
the
confrontation
came
about
on
cross-examination.
mr.
kenneth
l.
maddy
it
was
merely
indicated
in
the
record
that
the
witness,
david
wished
to
speak
to
the
suspect,
foster.
mr.
kenneth
l.
maddy
nothing
more,
what
was
said
at
the
confrontation
was
not
brought
out.
mr.
kenneth
l.
maddy
there
were
three
in
that
first
lineup.
mr.
kenneth
l.
maddy
that's
correct.
mr.
kenneth
l.
maddy
that's
correct.
mr.
kenneth
l.
maddy
it
was
not
brought
out
and
it's
not
in
the
record
what
they
talked
about.
it
was
merely
that
they
had
a
conversation
in
the
presence
of
the
district
attorney
and
in
the
presence
of
the
present
of
police
officer
in
a
private
room,
their
conversation
took
place.
mr.
kenneth
l.
maddy
david
testified
that
the
taller
individual
uttered
approximately
four
phrases.
i
think
comprising
18
words
and
he
did
make
some
reference
in
the
testimony
as
to
the
softness
of
the
voice.
mr.
kenneth
l.
maddy
there
is
a
reference
in
the
record
that
david
indicated
that
“i
thought
--
mr.
kenneth
l.
maddy
“i
thought
it
was
the
man.”
mr.
kenneth
l.
maddy
he
wanted
to
talk
to
him,
that's
correct.
the
point
is
that
he
did
not
make
and
our
point
is
that
he
did
not
make
a
positive
identification
that
he
said,
“i
thought
it
is
the
man”
and
we
point
to
the
fact
that
the
composition
of
the
first
lineup
which
could
only
bring
about
one
thing
and
that
was
that
the
individual
would
think
that
it
was
the
man
he
was
taller,
he
was
the
lone
tall
suspect,
and
he
was
dressed
similar
to
the
man
described
by
david
who
robbed
him.
we
suggest
to
that
suggestion
in
itself
brought
about
the
personal
confrontation.
we
have
indicated
in
our
--
mr.
kenneth
l.
maddy
he
was
unable
to
make
an
identification.
“i
was
not
--
mr.
kenneth
l.
maddy
in
the
record?
yes.
the
exact
page,
he
says
“i
was”
--
i
don't
have
it
right
of
hand.
he
says,
“i
was
not
sure.
i
could
not
make
a
positive
identification.”
it
was
his
answer
on
cross-examination
and
again
the
second
lineup
was
10
days
later.
now,
we
have
made
a
second
contention
concerning
a
violation
of
privilege
against
self-incrimination,
mindful
of
the
court's
decisions
in
wade
also
we
know
that
the
dissents
in
wade.
we
believe
this
case
may
present
a
factual
situation
that
the
court
can
again
review,
voice
identification
compelling
a
person
to
speak
of
the
lineup
in
relation
to
fifth
amendment.
mr.
kenneth
l.
maddy
there
were
no
statements,
justice
harlan,
used.
it
was
merely
the
fact,
it
is
in
the
record
and
it
is
clear
in
the
record
that
a
“conversation”
took
place
and
we
ask
the
court
if
there
are
certain
considerations
and
points
that
we've
made
in
our
brief
concerning
this
point
which
we
believe
are
clear,
i
believe
that
there
are
certainly
theories
whether
you
use
an
active
volitional
versus
passive
theory
or
to
this
effect
that
requiring
a
man
to
speak
is
sufficient
to
violate
his
rights,
we
feel
that
the
--
mr.
kenneth
l.
maddy
yes,
there
was
nothing
in
the
direct
examination
as
to
that
it
was
brought
out
on
cross-examination
the
fact
that
they
were
unable
--
he
was
unable
after
the
conference
to
make
an
identification.
mr.
kenneth
l.
maddy
that's
correct.
we
will
reserve
a
moment
or
two
if
the
court
please
to
for
rebuttal.
we
respectfully
request
and
submit
that
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
these
lineups
and
the
personal
confrontation
were
such
that
they
violated
mr.
foster's
rights
of
due
process
of
law
and
we
respectfully
request
the
matter
of
the
fifth
amendment
rights
to
be
reviewed
also.
mr.
kenneth
l.
maddy
may
it
please
the
court,
mr.
chief
justice.
just
one
or
two
comments
on
the
statements
of
ms.
maier.
first
of
all,
an
answer
to
the
two
points
she
made
concerning
discovery
rules
in
california
and
concerning
what
mr.
david,
the
witness
said
at
the
time
of
trial.
i
think
that
they're
both
significant
because
they
both
point
out
to
the
real
dangers
involve
with
lineup
situations.
first
of
all,
discovery
is
not
going
to
do
the
attorney
any
good
except
in
the
manner
that
he
can
bring
things
out
on
cross-examination.
as
an
attorney,
you're
face
with
the
problem
of
how
far
are
you
going
to
push
on
cross-examination
because
your
first
intent
at
that
time
is
to
win
your
case
if
you
can
at
the
time
of
trial.
you
can't
try
the
case
and
hope
that
or
the
prospect
as
mr.
foster
to
sit
in
false
imprisonment
for
two
years,
waiting
for
a
court
such
as
this
to
change
the
decision
based
on
the
records
you
established.
in
other
words,
i
think
this
is
the
danger
the
prosecution
is
not
going
to
bring
out
all
the
events
of
the
lineup.
they're
going
to
put
a
witness
on
the
stand
who
says,
as
mr.
david
did,
“i'm
positively
sure
that
that's
the
man
as
i
see
him
sitting
there
today.”
the
point
is
that
he
made
that
determination
based
on
the
improper
conduct
of
the
lineup
procedures
before
he
got
to
court.
i
think
the
majority
of
the
cases
do
not
show
that
the
prosecution
goes
into
prior
lineups
unless
the
individual,
the
witnesses
cannot
say
for
sure
of
the
time
of
trial.
he
has
to
refer
that
to
the
lineups.
so
i
think
that
the
two
points
that
the
respondent
makes
our
both
pointing
out
dangers
involved
with
the
lineup
situations.
the
second
point,
i
want
to
make
is
that
ms.
maier
made
to
reference
certain
factors
that
should
be
considered
by
the
court
in
reviewing
the
lineups.
she
mentioned,
had
the
witness
seen
the
man
before?
was
he
seen
in
the
custody
of
police
before?
did
he
know
anyone
in
the
lineup?
now,
we
feel
and
i
contend
that
the
second
lineup
is
the
most
important
lineup
here
because
all
of
the
things
that
she
mentioned
were
violated
in
the
second
lineup.
as
i
said
that's
crowning
blow
as
far
as
the
composition
of
the
second
lineup
was
concern
it
could
have
been
perfect
as
far
as
height
and
appearances
of
the
individuals
but
the
significant
point
was
that
walter
foster
was
the
only
man
in
that
second
lineup
that
was
in
the
first
lineup.
and
as
i
say,
there
could
not
been
anymore
suggested
situation
than
that
presented
by
the
prosecution
at
that
second
lineup.
