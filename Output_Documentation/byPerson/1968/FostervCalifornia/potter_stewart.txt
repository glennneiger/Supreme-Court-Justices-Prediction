justice
potter
stewart
but
now
grice
was
a
fellow
defendant
and
he
was
acquitted?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
that
brings
me
back
to
my
question.
grice
was
acquitted.
justice
potter
stewart
and
since
he
did
not
enter
the
western
union
office
there
was
no
identification
testimony
of
him
by
mr.
david.
justice
potter
stewart
there
was
simply
clay's
testimony
but
there
must
have
been
some
corroboration
or
else
there
would
have
been
a
directed
verdict
of
acquittal.
justice
potter
stewart
about
mr.
grice.
i'm
just
directing
my
brother
brennan's
question
to
you.
justice
potter
stewart
then
the
trial
court
didn't
understand
that
california
law
the
way
you're
telling
us
it
is.
justice
potter
stewart
what
was
it?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
didn't
david
tentatively
identify
the
man
at
the
first
lineup
before
he'd
spoke
to
him?
justice
potter
stewart
that
he
thought
it
was
the
man?
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
he
wanted
to
make
anyone
who
talk
to
him
to
make
sure
is
that
what
he
wanted.
justice
potter
stewart
that
conversation
been
asked
by
the
chief
justice's
question
a
little
earlier
appears
on
the
bottom
of
page
39
and
top
page
40
of
the
record
on
cross-examination
of
this.
justice
potter
stewart
you
said,
“that's
the
question
you
are
not
sure
at
that
time.”
and
he
said,
“pardon
me”
and
you
repeated,
“you
are
not
sure
at
that
time.”
the
answer
is,
“i
truthfully,
i
was
not
sure.”
that's
what
you
were
referring
to?
justice
potter
stewart
perhaps,
at
least
to
my
mind,
we
could
test
out
--
test
this
out
by
--
if
i
could
ask
you
what
corroboration
was
they
would
respect
to
mr.
grice,
the
man
was
acquitted
by
the
jury?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
grice
according
to
his
testimony
sat
in
the
automobile
and
never
run
into
the
western
union
office.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's
certain
--
that
certainly
wasn't
proved
against
him?
justice
potter
stewart
so?
justice
potter
stewart
it
was
very
thin
in
other
words.
justice
potter
stewart
questionable
under
--
justice
potter
stewart
oh!
what
is
the
question
of
fact?
you
have
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
the
accomplice
testimony.
justice
potter
stewart
clay
and
that's
all.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
say
the
only
corroboratory
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
evidence
was
the
fact
he
had
live
nearby
in
the
apartment?
justice
potter
stewart
but
now
grice
was
a
fellow
defendant

he
was
acquitted?
