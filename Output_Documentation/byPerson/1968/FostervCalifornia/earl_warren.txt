talked
to
them

according
to
california
--
the
california
rule,
what
corroborating
evidence
was
there
of
the
co-defendant,
that
would
go
to
make
this
as
a
stand
in
verdict
beyond
in
the
exclusion
of
a
reasonable
doubt.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i'd
like
to
know
just
what

as

has
to
be
--
there
has
to
be
corroboration

beyond
the
corps
delicti
always?
chief

earl
warren
that's
correct.

to
this
