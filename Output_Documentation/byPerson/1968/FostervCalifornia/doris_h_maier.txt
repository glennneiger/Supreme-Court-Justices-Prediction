ms.
doris
h.
maier
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we
would
also
call
the
court's
attention
at
this
point
to
the
language
in
page
33
of
the
appendix,
mr.
justice
stewart
has
read
from
page
39
and
this
is
the
identification
of
mr.
david
--
of
mr.
foster
at
the
first
line
that
were
he
states
in
answer
to
a
question,
“now
with
the
first
lineup,
did
you
identify
any
person?
was
the
defendant
foster
in
the
lineup?
i
did
not
at
that
time
say
specifically,
“well,
let
me
ask
you
first
with
the
defendant
foster
in
the
lineup.”
“yes,
sir
he
was.”
“and
did
you
identify
him?”
i
didn't
specifically
say,
“that
is
the
man.”
i
said,
“i
thought
it
was.”
now,
we
believe
that
as
an
answer
to
the
reason
and
right
after
that
where
the
witness
asked
for
the
second
lineup.
in
this
case,
the
rule
of
stovall
versus
denno
should
apply.
the
case
was
tried
prior
to
wade
or
gilbert,
therefore,
the
basic
question
of
counsel
at
the
time
of
lineups
is
a
critical
stage
of
the
proceeding
is
not
a
first
importance
in
this
particular
case
since
under
the
rule
of
stovall
it
would
not
be
retroactively
applied.
however,
in
stovall
this
court
nevertheless,
permitted
a
consideration
of
the
confrontation
depending
on
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
surrounding
it
to
consider
a
claim
of
lack
of
due
process
of
law.
the
petitioner
in
this
case
urges
that
the
term
“totality
of
circumstances”
be
limited
solely
to
the
exact
circumstances
of
the
lineup
and
not
taken
to
consideration
the
entire
case.
it
is
a
position
of
the
respondent
that
we
would
at
least
broaden
the
scope
of
this.
to
take
into
consideration
the
facts
involved
prior
to
the
time
of
the
lineup
proceedings.
now,
some
of
the
criteria
which
may
be
used
to
determine
whether
the
action
of
the
police
have
been
suggestive
and
tending
to
establish
mistaken
identification
have
been
set
forth
as
whether
any
preliminary
information
about
the
suspect
was
given
to
the
witness
or
the
victim
prior
to
the
time
of
lineup.
whether,
the
victim
knew
the
members
of
the
lineup
except
for
the
suspect,
whether,
there
was
a
prior
identification
by
the
witness
or
the
victim
of
another
individual.
whether,
there
was
a
discrepancy
between
the
preliminary
lineup
description
and
the
actual
one.
whether,
the
witness
or
victim
had
an
opportunity
to
observe
the
defendant
at
the
time
of
the
criminal
act,
the
time
that
had
elapsed
between
the
crime
and
the
lineup
and
then
the
facts
pertaining
to
the
actual
lineup.
if
we
apply
these
criteria
to
the
instant
case,
then
we
have
in
the
first
lineup
it
took
place
shortly
after
the
robbery
and
after
the
co-defendant,
clay
had
turn
himself
into
the
police.
he
then
had
apparently
designated
foster
as
his
co-defendant,
foster
was
apprehended.
at
that
time,
the
three
men,
the
victim
mr.
david
was
asked
to
come
to
the
police
station.
he
was
not
told
that
they
had
apprehended
any
suspects,
he
was
just
asked
to
view
a
lineup.
in
this
lineup
there
were
three
men,
they
were
all
negroes
petitioner
admittedly
was
the
tallest
by
mr.
david's
testimony.
however,
two
of
the
other
participants
in
the
lineup
who
were
shorter
both
had
hats
on
which
the
robber
did
at
the
time
of
the
robbery.
petitioner,
mr.
foster
had
on
a
leather
jacket
but
this
apparently
was
his
own
leather
jacket
because
he
wore
it
at
the
time
of
the
robbery
underneath
the
coverall
that
was
the
distinguishing
feature
of
the
identification
of
mr.
david.
this
lineup
was
not
like
wade
or
gilbert
subsequent
to
the
appointment
of
counsel.
it
probably
was
prior
to
arraignment
of
petitioner's
since
it
was
practically
immediately
after
the
petitioner's
apprehension.
there
was
no
prompting
of
mr.
david
the
witness
prior
to
this
lineup
by
the
police.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
no,
your
honor,
except
for
the
fact
that
the
petitioner,
mr.
foster
had
on
his
own
black
leather
jacket
were
not
asked
to
try
--
ms.
doris
h.
maier
well,
there
was
no
showing
that
all
of
the
men
were
dressed
alike
in
the
first
lineup.
no
showing
specifically
is
to
what
the
other
man
wore.
just
mr.
david's
testimony
that
the
petitioner
had
whom
he
tentatively
identified
at
that
time
had
this
black
leather
jacket
on.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
yes,
underneath
the
coverall.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
yes,
--
ms.
doris
h.
maier
--
by
mr.
david.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
no,
neither
the
coat
nor
doesn't
show
that
they
had
on
the
coats
or
jacket.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
the
three
--
there
were
three
men
involved.
petitioner
was
one
of
them.
the
other
two
were
smaller
at
this
time
but
the
other
two
had
hats
which
at
the
time
of
the
robbery
the
robbers
both
wore
hats
and
petitioner
did
not
have
a
hat
on
at
the
time
of
the
lineup.
now
this
lineup
was
apparently
in
the
city
jail
and
there
was
no
showing
other
people
were
available
at
that
time
that
could
have
been
used
for
purposes
of
a
lineup.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
fresno.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
well
that's
true
it's
larger
than
some
but
it
is
not
really
metropolitan
area
of
california.
then
there
was,
as
far
as
the
circumstances
of
this
lineup
there
was
no
showing
of
any
brutally
or
police
misconduct
with
relation
to
this.
and
there
was
no
showing
that
the
petitioner,
any
of
this
man
was
asked
to
take
any
affirmative
action
at
this
lineup.
right
immediately
after
that
when
the
victim,
mr.
david
had
made
his
tentative
identification.
he
asked
the
police
officer
if
he
could
hear
or
speak
to
mr.
foster.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
that
is
on
page
of
the
appendix,
page
33.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
33.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
we
are
talking
mr.
david's
testimony
at
the
trial.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
as
to
this.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
that
was
(a)
33.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
that
was
what
i
read
at
the
beginning,
your
honor,
i
didn't
specifically
say
that
“this
is
the
man.”
i
said,
“i
thought
it
was.”
ms.
doris
h.
maier
and
that
is
the
position
that
mr.
david
has
taken
through
the
course
of
this.
now,
right
after
that
then
in
accordance
with
mr.
david's
request,
mr.
foster
was
brought
into
a
room
in
which
mr.
david
was
a
police
officer
as
well
as
a
deputy
district
attorney.
the
record
shows
that
they
had
a
conversation
at
that
time.
no
contents
of
any
conversation
in
the
state
with
used.
in
fact,
this
confrontation
was
brought
out
solely
by
the
defense
counsel
on
cross-examination.
it
was
not
introduced
by
the
prosecution
as
part
of
its
case.
at
the
conclusion
of
this,
they
still
didn't
--
mr.
david
still
didn't
make
a
positive
identification.
but
about
a
week
or
10
days
later,
he
was
asked
to
view
another
lineup.
this
lineup
was
apparently
at
the
county
jail.
there
were
five
men
all
dressed
alike
in
jail
fatigues.
the
accomplice
grice
was
in
this
lineup.
apparently,
he
had
not
been
arrested
at
the
time
of
the
first
lineup
but
petitioner
was
the
only
one
present,
who
had
been
present
in
the
first
lineup.
the
victim
identified
petitioner
at
this
time,
but
there
was
no
showing
that
the
victim
had
been
primed
between
the
first
lineup
and
this
last
lineup.
nevertheless,
as
far
as
the
victim,
mr.
david
was
concerned
his
memory
improved
and
he
was
certain
in
his
own
mind
that
as
of
that
time
that
it
was
foster
who
was
one
of
the
robbers.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
not
in
this
lineup.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
not
in
this
lineup,
your
honor.
at
trial
the
--
mr.
david
and
the
accomplice
identified
petitioner
and
mr.
david
then
explained
that
at
the
time,
at
the
scene
of
the
robbery
that
he
had
taken
a
good
look,
a
good
hard
look
at
the
robbers
so
that
he
would
know
and
impress
on
his
mind
later.
that's
on
page
27
of
the
appendix
he
said
“and
i
stopped
and
this
at
the
time
of
the
robbery,
and
i
stopped
and
looked
back
at
them
i
was
about
10
or
12
feet
from
them
and
the
place
was
well
lit.
i
could
see
clearly
and
i
gave
them
what
you
call
a
hard
look,
i
wanted
to
know
in
my
mind
and
i
wanted
to
impress
in
my
memory
that
these
two
men
were.”
ms.
doris
h.
maier
i
think
the
man
was
extremely
cautious
individual
that
he
was
wanted
to
be
absolutely
certain
in
his
own
mind
that
he
was
accusing
the
right
man.
that
we
have
witnesses
who
desire
to
protect
individuals
and
that
they
do
not
want
to
be
guilty
anyway
of
misidentification
and
this
question
i
think
in
this
case,
mr.
david
displayed.
we
have
several
other
facts
with
relation
to
the
trial
that
i
would
call
to
this
court's
attention.
the
first
one
was
the
fact
that
at
trial
no
objection
was
raised
as
to
the
introduction
of
any
of
this
evidence
on
any
constitutional
grounds.
no
motion
to
strike
was
made.
admittedly,
this
case
was
tried
prior
to
the
court's
decision
in
wade
or
gilbert
but
it
was
subsequent
to
the
court's
decision
in
malloy
versus
hogan
and
therefore
any
alleged
question
of
a
violation
of
the
privilege
to
get
self-incrimination
should
have
been
raised
by
objection
in
the
trial
court.
this
was
not
raised
nor
was
any
of
the
objections
raised
in
motion
for
a
new
draft.
this
fact
appears
in
the
opinion
of
the
fifth
district
court
of
appeals
in
the
case.
it
should
be
noted
at
the
time
of
the
trial,
neither
of
the
robbers
were
masked.
so
that
there
was
no
question
such
as
palmer
versus
patent
that
the
question
of
voice
identification
was
the
ultimate.
at
the
time
of
the
robbery,
mr.
foster
spoke
demanding
the
victim
go
get
the
money
from
the
safe
and
told
him
to
do
it
and
then
hurry
and
get
the
particular
box.
now,
this
request
to
get
the
particular
box
would
tie
in
with
his
identity
in
which
there
was
evidence
brought
forth
at
the
trial
of
a
prior
conviction
of
mr.
foster
before
a
robbery
of
a
western
union
station
in
which
there
were
--
was
brought
forth
both
on
the
ground
of
similarity
of
modus
operandi
and
for
purposes
of
identity.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
yes.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
he
did
not
identify
mr.
grice,
the
co-defendant
because
mr.
grice
had
been
the
driver
of
the
getaway
car
he
had
never
entered
the
establishment.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
there
were
three
individuals
participating
in
the
robbery,
mr.
clay
and
mr.
foster
who
were
the
two
robbers
who
had
entered
the
western
union
office
and
participated
in
the
robbery.
mr.
grice,
the
other
accomplice
had
driven
the
get
away
car.
he
at
the
time
of
trial
testified
and
produced
and
alibi
which
apparently
was
believed
by
the
jury.
at
the
time
of
the
trial
in
this
case,
petitioner,
foster
did
not
take
the
stand
produced
no
evidence
of
alibi,
there
was
no
conflict
in
the
evidence
in
that
respect.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
the
record
is
not
clear
in
that,
your
honor.
i
would
assume
it
was
before
but
the
record
does
not
show.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
we
submit
that
in
this
case
the
petitioner
has
not
won
verdict
of
proving
that
they're
aware
of
violation
of
his
constitutional
rights
in
the
conduct
of
this
lineup.
that
petitioner
had
no
constitutional
right
not
to
participate
in
the
lineup.
that
he
also
had
no
constitution
or
right
not
to
speak
for
voice
identification.
this,
we
believe,
has
been
established
in
both
the
wade,
gilbert,
schmerber
cases
as
well
as
the
earlier
ones
uphold
in
breithaupt
decided
by
this
court.
the
voice
identification
here
would
only
have
been
used
this
one
factor
of
a
physical
identification.
it
was
a
sound
characteristic.
it
was
not
the
contents
of
the
words
that
were
spoken,
that
were
of
import
for
here.
it
were
the
actual
sound
of
the
petitioner's
voice
to
the
victim.
we
asked
this
court
that
if
there
should
be
any
year
of
founding
any
lineups,
then
the
application
of
a
harmless
error
rule
should
be
applied.
this
court
in
chapman
versus
california
recognized
that
you
could
apply
a
harmless
error
rule
to
a
constitutional
error.
we
believe
--
ms.
doris
h.
maier
the
standard
of
the
error
must
be
such
that
the
court
could
say
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt
that
the
judgment
would
have
been
had
other
than
the
--
whether
it's
a
particular
evidence
to
particular
error
had
been
committed
that
notwithstanding
this
error.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
i
believe
you
have
not
alone
the
testimony
of
the
accomplice
plus
the
corroboration
of
the
description.
up
now,
if
we
eliminate
all
of
the
lineup
by
identification
by
the
witness,
mr.
david
it
still
would
leave
his
testimony
as
to
the
elements
of
the
court
is
to
corpus
delicti
in
his
description
of
certainly
of
the
clothing
and
the
action
taking
at
the
time
of
the
scene
of
the
robbery
would
still
would
corroborate
the
accomplice's
testimony
and
i
think
you
could
be
use
the
limited
testimony
for
identification
purposes.
modus
operandi
could
be
use
to
aid
the
testimony
of
the
accomplice.
and
remember
in
under
california
law
the
testimony
of
the
accomplice
must
be
corroborated
but
the
corroboration
is
required
to
be
very
slight.
and
it
must
--
it
is
necessary
that
it
go
to
all
of
the
elements
of
the
event.
but
we
submit
that
in
this
case
we
have
that
corroboration.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
well,
you
have
the
testimony
of
the
victim
--
ms.
doris
h.
maier
that
as
to
the
corpus
delicti
the
elements
of
the
offense
of
robbery.
the
fact
as
to
description
of
the
individuals
at
the
scene
of
the
robbery
at
that
time
which
would
fully
corroborate
the
testimony
of
the
accomplice
as
to
--
ms.
doris
h.
maier
that's
correct.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
as
to
--
ms.
doris
h.
maier
the
identification
of
the
clothing
worn
by
one
of
the
robbers
which
was
petitioner
at
the
time
of
the
(inaudible).
i'm
not
talking
about
the
identification
of
the
lineups
but
the
--
separate
and
apart
from
the
petitioner
himself
as
perpetrator.
the
fact
of
the
clothing
one
by
one
of
those
individuals
would
corroborate
the
accomplice.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
the
coverall,
the
hat
with
the
brim
turned
down,
the
black
leather
jacket
showing
out
from
underneath
this
coverall,
the
grayish-white
shoes.
the
accomplice
at
the
time
of
the
trial
testified
as
to
the
clothing
that
the
--
ms.
doris
h.
maier
well,
that's
what
--
it
was
i
believe,
your
honor
that
the
description
--
ms.
doris
h.
maier
--
of
the
clothing.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
that
was
not
introduced
as
an
exhibit,
your
honor.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
it
was
testimony
--
ms.
doris
h.
maier
well,
this
testimony
came
in
through
the
testimony
of
mr.
david.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
well,
if
--
your
honor,
mr.
david's
testimony
only
because
of
his
testimony
with
relation
to
the
evidence
developed
that
the
lineups
would
be
out.
it
wouldn't
strike
his
testimony
as
a
witness
is
entirely
from
the
firm.
that
the
lineup
if
assume
--
you
assume
that
the
evidence
with
relations
to
the
lineups
was
improperly
adduced
with
that
that
would
not
of
necessity
eliminate
mr.
david
as
a
witness
in
the
case.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
at
the
scene
of
the
--
ms.
doris
h.
maier
scene
of
the
crime.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
the
only
corroboration
that
would
have
been
in
the
record
--
ms.
doris
h.
maier
he
was
the
one
--
he
was
only
living
in
the
same
building
with
or
next
door
to
mr.
foster
in
the
room.
that
was
the
testimony
of
the
landlady
that
said
they
were
associated
there.
she
had
seen
them
as
friends
at
that
time.
that
was
the
about
this
sum
total
of
the
corroboration
as
to
mr.
grice.
and
mr.
grice
himself
testified
as
to
an
alibi
defense.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
no.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
but
that
was
the
corroboration
as
this
--
ms.
doris
h.
maier
very,
very
thin.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
and
that
there
was
a
question
--
it
was
--
the
judge
left
it
as
a
question
of
fact
to
the
jury.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
whether
there
was
sufficient
--
ms.
doris
h.
maier
clay's
testimony
--
ms.
doris
h.
maier
clay
was
--
the
jury
was
advised
that
clay
was
an
accomplice
as
a
matter
of
law
and
that
his
testimony
must
be
corroborated.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
therefore
the
question
was
as
to
grice
whether
there
was
sufficient
corroboration
in
the
jury's
mind.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
the
only
evidence
that
would
have
really
it
had
as
to
--
ms.
doris
h.
maier
yes,
with
foster.
well,
we
would
go
one
further
point
to
the
court's
attention
and
that
is
at
the
time
of
this
trial
and
under
california
law,
the
petitioner
would
have
the
right
and
have
the
right
to
have
discovery
proceedings
in
a
criminal
case
that
this
petitioner
would
have
had
full
opportunity
to
ascertain
all
the
fact
in
circumstances
of
the
lineup
by
a
motion
to
obtain
the
statements
of
the
witnesses
to
that
lineup.
the
police
officers
that
were
present
and
including
any
photos
that
may
have
been
taken
of
the
lineup
by
the
police.
california
case
of
norton
versus
superior
court
decided
in
1959,
some
six
years
or
seven
prior
to
the
trial
of
this
case
would
have
given
counsel
for
petitioner
the
right
to
obtain
all
of
this
material
prior
to
its
cross-examination
for
purposes
of
testing
the
identification.
therefore,
we
have
a
rather
unusual
situation
in
this
respect
since
the
information
was
available
to
him
and
no
showing
was
made
in
the
record
of
whether
petitioner
did
or
did
not
avail
of
himself
of
it
but
he
could
have.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
well,
this
your
honor
--
ms.
doris
h.
maier
but
that
is
correct,
your
honor
but
we
are
referring
in
this
to
the
effect
on
this
case
where
the
question
in
the
primary
question
is
the
identification
of
petitioner.
now,
petitioner
had
full
opportunity
to
develop
any
discrepancies
in
this
case.
he
wasn't
stopped.
the
goal
was
i
--
correct
the
identification,
a
utilization
of
these
procedures
avoided
by
california
would
have
given
him
full
opportunity
to
explore
this
rights.
and
we
submit
that
in
the
light
of
the
whole
case
petitioner
has
not
borne
the
burden
of
proof
of
showing
there
was
a
lack
of
due
process
in
his
trial
and
conviction.
we
ask
that
the
judgment
of
the
california
court
be
affirmed.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we
would
also
call
the
court's
attention
at
this
point
to
the
language
in
page
33
of
the
appendix,
mr.
justice
stewart
has
read
from
page
39
and
this
is
the
identification
of
mr.
david
--
of
mr.
foster
at
the
first
line
that
were
he
states
in
answer
to
a
question,
“now
with
the
first
lineup,
did
you
identify
any
person?
was
the
defendant
foster
in
the
lineup?
i
did
not
at
that
time
say
specifically,
“well,
let
me
ask
you
first
with
the
defendant
foster
in
the
lineup.”
“yes,
sir
he
was.”
“and
did
you
identify
him?”
i
didn't
specifically
say,
“that
is
the
man.”
i
said,
“i
thought
it
was.”
now,
we
believe
that
as
an
answer
to
the
reason
and
right
after
that
where
the
witness
asked
for
the
second
lineup.
in
this
case,
the
rule
of
stovall
versus
denno
should
apply.
the
case
was
tried
prior
to
wade
or
gilbert,
therefore,
the
basic
question
of
counsel
at
the
time
of
lineups
is
a
critical
stage
of
the
proceeding
is
not
a
first
importance
in
this
particular
case
since
under
the
rule
of
stovall
it
would
not
be
retroactively
applied.
however,
in
stovall
this
court
nevertheless,
permitted
a
consideration
of
the
confrontation
depending
on
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
surrounding
it
to
consider
a
claim
of
lack
of
due
process
of
law.
the
petitioner
in
this
case
urges
that
the
term
“totality
of
circumstances”
be
limited
solely
to
the
exact
circumstances
of
the
lineup
and
not
taken
to
consideration
the
entire
case.
it
is
a
position
of
the
respondent
that
we
would
at
least
broaden
the
scope
of
this.
to
take
into
consideration
the
facts
involved
prior
to
the
time
of
the
lineup
proceedings.
now,
some
of
the
criteria
which
may
be
used
to
determine
whether
the
action
of
the
police
have
been
suggestive
and
tending
to
establish
mistaken
identification
have
been
set
forth
as
whether
any
preliminary
information
about
the
suspect
was
given
to
the
witness
or
the
victim
prior
to
the
time
of
lineup.
whether,
the
victim
knew
the
members
of
the
lineup
except
for
the
suspect,
whether,
there
was
a
prior
identification
by
the
witness
or
the
victim
of
another
individual.
whether,
there
was
a
discrepancy
between
the
preliminary
lineup
description
and
the
actual
one.
whether,
the
witness
or
victim
had
an
opportunity
to
observe
the
defendant
at
the
time
of
the
criminal
act,
the
time
that
had
elapsed
between
the
crime
and
the
lineup
and
then
the
facts
pertaining
to
the
actual
lineup.
if
we
apply
these
criteria
to
the
instant
case,
then
we
have
in
the
first
lineup
it
took
place
shortly
after
the
robbery
and
after
the
co-defendant,
clay
had
turn
himself
into
the
police.
he
then
had
apparently
designated
foster
as
his
co-defendant,
foster
was
apprehended.
at
that
time,
the
three
men,
the
victim
mr.
david
was
asked
to
come
to
the
police
station.
he
was
not
told
that
they
had
apprehended
any
suspects,
he
was
just
asked
to
view
a
lineup.
in
this
lineup
there
were
three
men,
they
were
all
negroes
petitioner
admittedly
was
the
tallest
by
mr.
david's
testimony.
however,
two
of
the
other
participants
in
the
lineup
who
were
shorter
both
had
hats
on
which
the
robber
did
at
the
time
of
the
robbery.
petitioner,
mr.
foster
had
on
a
leather
jacket
but
this
apparently
was
his
own
leather
jacket
because
he
wore
it
at
the
time
of
the
robbery
underneath
the
coverall
that
was
the
distinguishing
feature
of
the
identification
of
mr.
david.
this
lineup
was
not
like
wade
or
gilbert
subsequent
to
the
appointment
of
counsel.
it
probably
was
prior
to
arraignment
of
petitioner's
since
it
was
practically
immediately
after
the
petitioner's
apprehension.
there
was
no
prompting
of
mr.
david
the
witness
prior
to
this
lineup
by
the
police.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
no,
your
honor,
except
for
the
fact
that
the
petitioner,
mr.
foster
had
on
his
own
black
leather
jacket
were
not
asked
to
try
--
ms.
doris
h.
maier
well,
there
was
no
showing
that
all
of
the
men
were
dressed
alike
in
the
first
lineup.
no
showing
specifically
is
to
what
the
other
man
wore.
just
mr.
david's
testimony
that
the
petitioner
had
whom
he
tentatively
identified
at
that
time
had
this
black
leather
jacket
on.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
yes,
underneath
the
coverall.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
yes,
--
ms.
doris
h.
maier
--
by
mr.
david.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
no,
neither
the
coat
nor
doesn't
show
that
they
had
on
the
coats
or
jacket.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
the
three
--
there
were
three
men
involved.
petitioner
was
one
of
them.
the
other
two
were
smaller
at
this
time
but
the
other
two
had
hats
which
at
the
time
of
the
robbery
the
robbers
both
wore
hats
and
petitioner
did
not
have
a
hat
on
at
the
time
of
the
lineup.
now
this
lineup
was
apparently
in
the
city
jail
and
there
was
no
showing
other
people
were
available
at
that
time
that
could
have
been
used
for
purposes
of
a
lineup.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
fresno.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
well
that's
true
it's
larger
than
some
but
it
is
not
really
metropolitan
area
of
california.
then
there
was,
as
far
as
the
circumstances
of
this
lineup
there
was
no
showing
of
any
brutally
or
police
misconduct
with
relation
to
this.
and
there
was
no
showing
that
the
petitioner,
any
of
this
man
was
asked
to
take
any
affirmative
action
at
this
lineup.
right
immediately
after
that
when
the
victim,
mr.
david
had
made
his
tentative
identification.
he
asked
the
police
officer
if
he
could
hear
or
speak
to
mr.
foster.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
that
is
on
page
of
the
appendix,
page
33.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
33.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
we
are
talking
mr.
david's
testimony
at
the
trial.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
as
to
this.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
that
was
(a)
33.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
that
was
what
i
read
at
the
beginning,
your
honor,
i
didn't
specifically
say
that
“this
is
the
man.”
i
said,
“i
thought
it
was.”
ms.
doris
h.
maier
and
that
is
the
position
that
mr.
david
has
taken
through
the
course
of
this.
now,
right
after
that
then
in
accordance
with
mr.
david's
request,
mr.
foster
was
brought
into
a
room
in
which
mr.
david
was
a
police
officer
as
well
as
a
deputy
district
attorney.
the
record
shows
that
they
had
a
conversation
at
that
time.
no
contents
of
any
conversation
in
the
state
with
used.
in
fact,
this
confrontation
was
brought
out
solely
by
the
defense
counsel
on
cross-examination.
it
was
not
introduced
by
the
prosecution
as
part
of
its
case.
at
the
conclusion
of
this,
they
still
didn't
--
mr.
david
still
didn't
make
a
positive
identification.
but
about
a
week
or
10
days
later,
he
was
asked
to
view
another
lineup.
this
lineup
was
apparently
at
the
county
jail.
there
were
five
men
all
dressed
alike
in
jail
fatigues.
the
accomplice
grice
was
in
this
lineup.
apparently,
he
had
not
been
arrested
at
the
time
of
the
first
lineup
but
petitioner
was
the
only
one
present,
who
had
been
present
in
the
first
lineup.
the
victim
identified
petitioner
at
this
time,
but
there
was
no
showing
that
the
victim
had
been
primed
between
the
first
lineup
and
this
last
lineup.
nevertheless,
as
far
as
the
victim,
mr.
david
was
concerned
his
memory
improved
and
he
was
certain
in
his
own
mind
that
as
of
that
time
that
it
was
foster
who
was
one
of
the
robbers.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
not
in
this
lineup.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
not
in
this
lineup,
your
honor.
at
trial
the
--
mr.
david
and
the
accomplice
identified
petitioner
and
mr.
david
then
explained
that
at
the
time,
at
the
scene
of
the
robbery
that
he
had
taken
a
good
look,
a
good
hard
look
at
the
robbers
so
that
he
would
know
and
impress
on
his
mind
later.
that's
on
page
27
of
the
appendix
he
said
“and
i
stopped
and
this
at
the
time
of
the
robbery,
and
i
stopped
and
looked
back
at
them
i
was
about
10
or
12
feet
from
them
and
the
place
was
well
lit.
i
could
see
clearly
and
i
gave
them
what
you
call
a
hard
look,
i
wanted
to
know
in
my
mind
and
i
wanted
to
impress
in
my
memory
that
these
two
men
were.”
ms.
doris
h.
maier
i
think
the
man
was
extremely
cautious
individual
that
he
was
wanted
to
be
absolutely
certain
in
his
own
mind
that
he
was
accusing
the
right
man.
that
we
have
witnesses
who
desire
to
protect
individuals
and
that
they
do
not
want
to
be
guilty
anyway
of
misidentification
and
this
question
i
think
in
this
case,
mr.
david
displayed.
we
have
several
other
facts
with
relation
to
the
trial
that
i
would
call
to
this
court's
attention.
the
first
one
was
the
fact
that
at
trial
no
objection
was
raised
as
to
the
introduction
of
any
of
this
evidence
on
any
constitutional
grounds.
no
motion
to
strike
was
made.
admittedly,
this
case
was
tried
prior
to
the
court's
decision
in
wade
or
gilbert
but
it
was
subsequent
to
the
court's
decision
in
malloy
versus
hogan
and
therefore
any
alleged
question
of
a
violation
of
the
privilege
to
get
self-incrimination
should
have
been
raised
by
objection
in
the
trial
court.
this
was
not
raised
nor
was
any
of
the
objections
raised
in
motion
for
a
new
draft.
this
fact
appears
in
the
opinion
of
the
fifth
district
court
of
appeals
in
the
case.
it
should
be
noted
at
the
time
of
the
trial,
neither
of
the
robbers
were
masked.
so
that
there
was
no
question
such
as
palmer
versus
patent
that
the
question
of
voice
identification
was
the
ultimate.
at
the
time
of
the
robbery,
mr.
foster
spoke
demanding
the
victim
go
get
the
money
from
the
safe
and
told
him
to
do
it
and
then
hurry
and
get
the
particular
box.
now,
this
request
to
get
the
particular
box
would
tie
in
with
his
identity
in
which
there
was
evidence
brought
forth
at
the
trial
of
a
prior
conviction
of
mr.
foster
before
a
robbery
of
a
western
union
station
in
which
there
were
--
was
brought
forth
both
on
the
ground
of
similarity
of
modus
operandi
and
for
purposes
of
identity.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
yes.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
he
did
not
identify
mr.
grice,
the
co-defendant
because
mr.
grice
had
been
the
driver
of
the
getaway
car
he
had
never
entered
the
establishment.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
there
were
three
individuals
participating
in
the
robbery,
mr.
clay
and
mr.
foster
who
were
the
two
robbers
who
had
entered
the
western
union
office
and
participated
in
the
robbery.
mr.
grice,
the
other
accomplice
had
driven
the
get
away
car.
he
at
the
time
of
trial
testified
and
produced
and
alibi
which
apparently
was
believed
by
the
jury.
at
the
time
of
the
trial
in
this
case,
petitioner,
foster
did
not
take
the
stand
produced
no
evidence
of
alibi,
there
was
no
conflict
in
the
evidence
in
that
respect.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
the
record
is
not
clear
in
that,
your
honor.
i
would
assume
it
was
before
but
the
record
does
not
show.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
we
submit
that
in
this
case
the
petitioner
has
not
won
verdict
of
proving
that
they're
aware
of
violation
of
his
constitutional
rights
in
the
conduct
of
this
lineup.
that
petitioner
had
no
constitutional
right
not
to
participate
in
the
lineup.
that
he
also
had
no
constitution
or
right
not
to
speak
for
voice
identification.
this,
we
believe,
has
been
established
in
both
the
wade,
gilbert,
schmerber
cases
as
well
as
the
earlier
ones
uphold
in
breithaupt
decided
by
this
court.
the
voice
identification
here
would
only
have
been
used
this
one
factor
of
a
physical
identification.
it
was
a
sound
characteristic.
it
was
not
the
contents
of
the
words
that
were
spoken,
that
were
of
import
for
here.
it
were
the
actual
sound
of
the
petitioner's
voice
to
the
victim.
we
asked
this
court
that
if
there
should
be
any
year
of
founding
any
lineups,
then
the
application
of
a
harmless
error
rule
should
be
applied.
this
court
in
chapman
versus
california
recognized
that
you
could
apply
a
harmless
error
rule
to
a
constitutional
error.
we
believe
--
ms.
doris
h.
maier
the
standard
of
the
error
must
be
such
that
the
court
could
say
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt
that
the
judgment
would
have
been
had
other
than
the
--
whether
it's
a
particular
evidence
to
particular
error
had
been
committed
that
notwithstanding
this
error.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
i
believe
you
have
not
alone
the
testimony
of
the
accomplice
plus
the
corroboration
of
the
description.
up
now,
if
we
eliminate
all
of
the
lineup
by
identification
by
the
witness,
mr.
david
it
still
would
leave
his
testimony
as
to
the
elements
of
the
court
is
to
corpus
delicti
in
his
description
of
certainly
of
the
clothing
and
the
action
taking
at
the
time
of
the
scene
of
the
robbery
would
still
would
corroborate
the
accomplice's
testimony
and
i
think
you
could
be
use
the
limited
testimony
for
identification
purposes.
modus
operandi
could
be
use
to
aid
the
testimony
of
the
accomplice.
and
remember
in
under
california
law
the
testimony
of
the
accomplice
must
be
corroborated
but
the
corroboration
is
required
to
be
very
slight.
and
it
must
--
it
is
necessary
that
it
go
to
all
of
the
elements
of
the
event.
but
we
submit
that
in
this
case
we
have
that
corroboration.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
well,
you
have
the
testimony
of
the
victim
--
ms.
doris
h.
maier
that
as
to
the
corpus
delicti
the
elements
of
the
offense
of
robbery.
the
fact
as
to
description
of
the
individuals
at
the
scene
of
the
robbery
at
that
time
which
would
fully
corroborate
the
testimony
of
the
accomplice
as
to
--
ms.
doris
h.
maier
that's
correct.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
as
to
--
ms.
doris
h.
maier
the
identification
of
the
clothing
worn
by
one
of
the
robbers
which
was
petitioner
at
the
time
of
the
(inaudible).
i'm
not
talking
about
the
identification
of
the
lineups
but
the
--
separate
and
apart
from
the
petitioner
himself
as
perpetrator.
the
fact
of
the
clothing
one
by
one
of
those
individuals
would
corroborate
the
accomplice.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
the
coverall,
the
hat
with
the
brim
turned
down,
the
black
leather
jacket
showing
out
from
underneath
this
coverall,
the
grayish-white
shoes.
the
accomplice
at
the
time
of
the
trial
testified
as
to
the
clothing
that
the
--
ms.
doris
h.
maier
well,
that's
what
--
it
was
i
believe,
your
honor
that
the
description
--
ms.
doris
h.
maier
--
of
the
clothing.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
that
was
not
introduced
as
an
exhibit,
your
honor.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
it
was
testimony
--
ms.
doris
h.
maier
well,
this
testimony
came
in
through
the
testimony
of
mr.
david.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
well,
if
--
your
honor,
mr.
david's
testimony
only
because
of
his
testimony
with
relation
to
the
evidence
developed
that
the
lineups
would
be
out.
it
wouldn't
strike
his
testimony
as
a
witness
is
entirely
from
the
firm.
that
the
lineup
if
assume
--
you
assume
that
the
evidence
with
relations
to
the
lineups
was
improperly
adduced
with
that
that
would
not
of
necessity
eliminate
mr.
david
as
a
witness
in
the
case.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
at
the
scene
of
the
--
ms.
doris
h.
maier
scene
of
the
crime.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
the
only
corroboration
that
would
have
been
in
the
record
--
ms.
doris
h.
maier
he
was
the
one
--
he
was
only
living
in
the
same
building
with
or
next
door
to
mr.
foster
in
the
room.
that
was
the
testimony
of
the
landlady
that
said
they
were
associated
there.
she
had
seen
them
as
friends
at
that
time.
that
was
the
about
this
sum
total
of
the
corroboration
as
to
mr.
grice.
and
mr.
grice
himself
testified
as
to
an
alibi
defense.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
no.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
but
that
was
the
corroboration
as
this
--
ms.
doris
h.
maier
very,
very
thin.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
and
that
there
was
a
question
--
it
was
--
the
judge
left
it
as
a
question
of
fact
to
the
jury.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
whether
there
was
sufficient
--
ms.
doris
h.
maier
clay's
testimony
--
ms.
doris
h.
maier
clay
was
--
the
jury
was
advised
that
clay
was
an
accomplice
as
a
matter
of
law
and
that
his
testimony
must
be
corroborated.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
therefore
the
question
was
as
to
grice
whether
there
was
sufficient
corroboration
in
the
jury's
mind.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
the
only
evidence
that
would
have
really
it
had
as
to
--
ms.
doris
h.
maier
yes,
with
foster.
well,
we
would
go
one
further
point
to
the
court's
attention
and
that
is
at
the
time
of
this
trial
and
under
california
law,
the
petitioner
would
have
the
right
and
have
the
right
to
have
discovery
proceedings
in
a
criminal
case
that
this
petitioner
would
have
had
full
opportunity
to
ascertain
all
the
fact
in
circumstances
of
the
lineup
by
a
motion
to
obtain
the
statements
of
the
witnesses
to
that
lineup.
the
police
officers
that
were
present
and
including
any
photos
that
may
have
been
taken
of
the
lineup
by
the
police.
california
case
of
norton
versus
superior
court
decided
in
1959,
some
six
years
or
seven
prior
to
the
trial
of
this
case
would
have
given
counsel
for
petitioner
the
right
to
obtain
all
of
this
material
prior
to
its
cross-examination
for
purposes
of
testing
the
identification.
therefore,
we
have
a
rather
unusual
situation
in
this
respect
since
the
information
was
available
to
him
and
no
showing
was
made
in
the
record
of
whether
petitioner
did
or
did
not
avail
of
himself
of
it
but
he
could
have.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
well,
this
your
honor
--
ms.
doris
h.
maier
but
that
is
correct,
your
honor
but
we
are
referring
in
this
to
the
effect
on
this
case
where
the
question
in
the
primary
question
is
the
identification
of
petitioner.
now,
petitioner
had
full
opportunity
to
develop
any
discrepancies
in
this
case.
he
wasn't
stopped.
the
goal
was
i
--
correct
the
identification,
a
utilization
of
these
procedures
avoided
by
california
would
have
given
him
full
opportunity
to
explore
this
rights.
and
we
submit
that
in
the
light
of
the
whole
case
petitioner
has
not
borne
the
burden
of
proof
of
showing
there
was
a
lack
of
due
process
in
his
trial
and
conviction.
we
ask
that
the
judgment
of
the
california
court
be
affirmed.
