justice
potter
stewart
does
your
argument
extend
to
people
in
the
military
service
who
were
overseas
in
time
of
peace.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
think
so
too.
i
was
asking
you
a
question.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
would
suppose,
there's
at
least
a
factual
if
not
a
theoretical
difference
between
a
soldier
in
south
vietnam
and
one
in
london,
england
today
for
instance.
justice
potter
stewart
i
should
think
mr.
rabinowitz
and
just
thinking
out
loud,
if
you
will,
that
your
argument
--
your
constitutional
argument
would
necessarily
extend
to
military
people
overseas
in
time
of
peace
who
commit
basically
whether
civilian
crimes.
justice
potter
stewart
larceny
and
rape
and
murder
and
theft
and
assault
and
battery
against
say
the
local
civilian
population
or
members
of
it.
justice
potter
stewart
it
gets
a
bit
circular
doesn't
it?
it
might
--
in
your
submission,
it
might
not
even
be
a
crime
against
the
united
states.
