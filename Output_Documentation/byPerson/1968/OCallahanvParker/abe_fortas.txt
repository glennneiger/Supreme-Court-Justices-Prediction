justice
abe
fortas
are
there
any
limitations
as
you
see
them
on
power
of
congress
under
article
i,
section
8,
clause
14?
justice
abe
fortas
no,
i'm
just
saying
generally
to
--
what
is
your
view
of
the
tax
evasion
case?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that
would
come
i
take
it
that
that
would
might
come
under
the
10
u.s.c.
section
934,
all
of
disorders
and
neglects
of
the
prejudice
of
good
order
and
discipline
in
the
armed
forces
or
conduct
of
a
nature
to
bring
discredit
upon
the
armed
forces.
i
suppose
if
it's
broad,
it
will
be
broad
under
that.
justice
abe
fortas
you
particularize
that
and
i
don't
want
to
--
justice
abe
fortas
but
i'll
tell
you
to
comment
on
another
case
but
i
would
like
to
know
whether
you
think
there
are
any
restrictions
of
congressional
power
under
article
i,
section
8
and
if
so,
what
are
they
because
that
clause
empower
of
congress
to
make
rules
for
the
government
in
regulation
of
the
land
and
naval
forces.
now,
does
that,
in
effect
mean
that
congress
can
set
up
a
separate
set
of
--
a
comprehensive
set
of
separate
rules
for
members
of
the
armed
forces,
if
not,
what
are
the
limitations?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
maybe
we
do.
maybe
we
do.
maybe
i
do,
so
i'd
like
to
know
from
you
directly,
you
think
that
congress
could
set
up
a
totally,
totally
comprehensive
set
of
rules
to
government
conduct
of
individuals
by
virtue
of
their
status
in
the
armed
forces,
to
be
separated
in
a
pact?
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that.
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that
there,
alright,
but
what
i'm
trying
to
--
i
think
you've
answered
my
question,
you
say
that
congress
could
like
any
rules,
whatever,
either
one
in
two,
that
those
rules
be
and
i
suppose
those
rules
could
be
preclusive
of
civilian
authority.
justice
abe
fortas
if
you
are
going
to
try
to
confine
a
discussion
here
to
this
particular
case,
you're
going
to
leave
me
substantially
without
your
--
the
benefit
of
your
assistance.
justice
abe
fortas
but
what
does
this
--
justice
abe
fortas
well
then,
you
say
that
congress
could
not
under
this
constitutional
provision
set
up
a
system
of
rules
that
would
be
preclusive
of
the
civilian
authority
in
some
respect.
i'm
trying
to
find
out
what
the
phrase
“government
in
regulation
of
the
land
and
naval
forces”
means
in
terms
of
your
submission
as
counsel
for
the
government.
justice
abe
fortas
is
there
any
first
amendment
limitation
upon
the
power
of
congress?
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
the
first
amendment
does
restrict
this.
how
about
the
sixth
amendment?
justice
abe
fortas
how
about
the
right
to
confrontation
of
witnesses?
justice
abe
fortas
then
i'll
ask
you
one
more
question
then
i'm
finished.
i
take
it
then
from
what
you've
said
that
it
is
your
submission,
article
i,
section
8
clause
14,
authorizes
congress
to
make
a
complete
set
of
criminal
rules,
what
we
ordinarily
refer
to
as
criminal
rules
applicable
to
the
persons
by
virtue
of
their
status
as
members
of
the
land
and
naval
forces
of
the
united
states.
justice
abe
fortas
that
would
include
for
example
the
power
of
congress
to
make
it
a
crime
and
not
to
submit
their
income
tax
returns
on
time.
justice
abe
fortas
you
and
i
think,
maybe
we
think
definitely
because
i
have
to
think
beyond
the
limits
of
the
individual
case.
i
guess
you
do
too,
don't
you
really?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
springer,
may
i
ask
you
this,
let's
suppose
that
a
member
of
the
armed
forces
in
civilian
uniform
while
on
furlough,
cashed
a
bad
check
in
a
store
in
a
civilian
community,
now,
is
it
your
construction
of
the
constitution
that
a
court-martial
jurisdiction
would
be
authorized?
justice
abe
fortas
have
i
made
myself
clear?
justice
abe
fortas
what
do
you
mean
by
that?
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
stating
to
you
that
it
was
a
check
cashed
in
a
store.
i
particularized
it.
let's
suppose
it
was
a
clothing
store,
men's
clothing
store
on
the
corner
of
maine
and
madison
in
memphis,
tennessee.
justice
abe
fortas
i
suppose
he
was
--
i'm
not
asking
you
that.
i'm
asking
you
for
your
constitutional
theory.
does
the
phrase
“government
in
regulation
of
the
sea
and
land
forces
of
the
united
states”
authorized,
constitutionally
authorized
congress
by
a
statute
to
provide
for
the
prosecution
of
this
man
in
civilian
clothes
for
this
particular
offense.
justice
abe
fortas
on
what
theory?
justice
abe
fortas
you
would
have
to
take
the
position
if
i
understand
you
that
if
a
distinction
were
drawn,
it
would
be
incorrect,
it
would
be
in
violation
of
the
constitution,
do
you
or
do
you
not
say
that?
justice
abe
fortas
you
don't
take
that
position?
justice
abe
fortas
does
that
make
any
difference
to
you
whether
a
man
was
on
furlough
or
whether
he
was
just
a
--
whether
he
was
awol
or
whether
he
was
just
out
for
a
night
on
the
town?
justice
abe
fortas
it's
not
--
that's
not
one
of
the
questions.
it's
a
lead
question,
isn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
are
there
any
limitations
as
you
see
them
on
power
of
