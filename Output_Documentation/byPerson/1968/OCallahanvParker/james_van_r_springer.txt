mr.
james
van
r.
springer
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
it's
important
that
in
this
case,
what
we
are
discussing
is
a
constitutional
grant
of
jurisdiction
to
the
congress
to
legislate.
clause
14
of
section
8
of
article
i
provides
that
congress
has
the
jurisdiction
to
make
rules
for
the
government
in
regulation
of
the
land
and
naval
forces.
it's
our
position
that
this
power
permitted
congress
to
legislate
the
specific
provisions
of
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice
upon
which
sergeant
o'callahan
was
convicted.
we
submit
that
congress
does
have
a
concurrent
jurisdiction
with
the
civil
authorities
to
punish
offenses
committed
by
military
personnel
who
are
in
active
military
status
without
limitation
as
to
whether
or
not
the
offenses
are
committed
on
a
military
post
or
on
duty.
in
fact,
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice
and
the
articles
of
war
of
1916
which
in
substances
were
effect
until
1950
when
the
code
was
enacted
had
quite
and
have
quite
detail
provisions
relating
to
so-called
non-military
offenses.
the
code
includes,
of
course,
the
offenses
in
question
in
this
case,
rape
or
attempted
rape,
assault,
house
breaking
and
also
covers
specifically
most
of
the
other
principal
offenses
that
servicemen
might
commit
against
the
civilian
communities
such
as
murder,
larceny,
bad
check
offenses,
drunken
driving,
reckless
driving,
disorderly
conduct,
breech
of
the
peace.
as
mr.
rabinowitz
has
suggested,
this
jurisdiction
has
been
exercised
and
is
being
exercised
in
a
great
many
cases
that
arise
both
in
the
united
states
and
abroad.
in
the
united
states,
there
are
working
arrangements
between
the
military
and
the
civil
authorities,
both
the
department
of
justice
and
state
and
local
authorities
which
divide
up
the
concurring
jurisdiction
that
exists
under
the
uniform
code.
generally
speaking,
the
military
does
turn
offenders
against
the
civil
laws
over
to
the
civil
authorities
if
the
civil
authorities
request
it.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
the
civil
authorities
had
him
and
turned
him
over
to
the
military
police
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
--
who
proceeded
with
the
case.
those
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
well,
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
would
suggest
that
the
test
perhaps
should
be
framed
in
terms
of
the
constitution
with
stops
the
government
and
regulation
of
the
land
and
naval
forces.
we
submit
that
one
aspect
of
the
government
in
regulation
of
the
land
and
naval
forces
is
a
reasonable
amount
of
control
by
those
forces
over
the
behavior
of
their
members
when
they're,
so
to
speak,
turn
loose
on
the
civilian
community
in
which
they're
stationed.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
no,
well,
of
course,
what
i'm
saying
is
that
there
is
an
exclusive
military
jurisdiction.
we
say
that
there
is
a
concurrent
jurisdiction.
this
case
does
not
present
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
the
odds
as
to
what
would
happen
in
that,
i'm
sure
the
case
would
be
handled
by
the
civilian
authorities.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
well,
there
are
--
the
policy
of
the
army
and
of
the
services
is
that
ordinarily
upon
request
offenders
against
the
civilian
laws
will
be
turned
over
to
the
civilian
authorities.
i'm
sure
that
policy
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes
but
i'm
sure
there
are
--
there
would
be
a
request
in
such
a
case.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes.
yes,
that's
certainly
is
the
consequence
of
the
existence
of
this
concurrent
military
jurisdiction.
and
by
85%
of
the
cases
within
the
united
states
in
the
year
1967,
the
civilian
authorities
in
fact
did
take
jurisdiction
over
serious
offenses.
but
there
were
something
like
750
cases,
serious
cases
where
the
military
authorities
did
prosecute
and
there
are
many
war
cases
and
i
believe
much
harder
proportion
of
less
serious
offenses.
overseas
in
1967,
although
our
status
of
forces
agreements
do
give
jurisdiction
to
the
local
authorities
where
american
men
are
stationed
in
almost
all
cases
except
for
cases
involving
only
american
personnel
and
cases
involving
crimes
committed
while
on
duty.
in
those
overseas
cases,
there
were
some
18,000
military
prosecutions
in
the
year
1967,
so
that
we
submit
that
this
is
a
broad
jurisdiction,
a
broadly
exercised
jurisdiction
that's
at
stake.
one
as
to
which
there
are
apparently
smoothly
operating
arrangements
between
civilian
and
military
authorities
and
we
submit
that
the
constitution
does
not
require
this
jurisdiction
to
be
given
up
by
the
military.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
as
for
--
you're
thinking
perhaps
of
the
tax
evasion
case.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
first
of
all,
i
think
that
there
might
well
be
a
statutory
question
there.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i'm
quite
sure
that
was
what
it
was
brought
under
and
not
knowing
the
case.
but
as
i
say,
there
may
be
some
questions
which
i
don't
think
are
raised
in
this
case.
it's
just
how,
how
that
article
could
be
applied.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
but
as
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
think
it
probably
does
mean
that
but
i
think
we
don't
have
to
go
that
far
in
this
case.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
think
that
does
have
to
follow
from
the
broad
language
that's
in
the
constitution
itself.
but
as
i
say,
this
is
a
--
this
case
is
not.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
as
extreme
a
case.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
again,
we
don't
have
a
preclusion
case
here.
that
would
be,
i
think,
of
a
troublesome
case
if
it
were.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
think
i
would
have
to
say
that
if
the
military
or
if
congress
purported
to
preclude
state
jurisdiction
over
some
of
these
crimes
that
would
certainly
be
a
difficult
case.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
think
the
question
here,
is
i
think
framed
and
perhaps
to
my
mind,
should
be
restricted
to
the
question
whether
legislation
can
as
the
plaintiff
asserts,
deprive
the
individual
defendant
of
his
jury
right.
it's
not
a
jurisdictional
fight
between
the
military
authorities
and
the
states.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
well,
i
do
have
to
confess
that
i'm
troubled
and
i
hate
to
make
a
commitment
as
to
the
most
extreme
application
that
this
could
be
given.
it
may
well
be
that
in
certain
areas
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
under
these
articles?
yes,
i
believe
there
is
and
in
fact
the
court
of
military
justice
draw
any
suggestions
from
this
court's
opinion
in
burns
and
wilson
had
said
that
the
constitution
does
in
general
apply
to
the
military
men
and
to
the
procedure
in
military
trials.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
as
to
the
right
to
jury
trial,
i
think
it's
--
it
has
been
established
that
the
grant
to
jurisdiction
to
congress
and
the
clause
14
is
inconsistent
with
it.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
that
is
a
case
which
in
fact
has
within
the
last
couple
of
years
have
risen
in
the
court
of
military
bills,
the
court
of
military
bill
does
held
that
that
right
does
in
fact
exist.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
under
the
constitution?
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes.
the
court
of
military
bills
has
said
as
flatly
i
think
as
could
be
said
that
the
constitution
operates
directly
upon
military.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yeah.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
think
--
i
think
i
would
have
to
say
that
it
would
be
our
position
apparently
to
go
that
far,
though
of
course,
i
would
say
again
that
i
don't
think
it
necessary
to
go
that
far
to
decide
this
case
or
really
the
general
problem
raised
by
this
case.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes
indeed
and
of
course
this
case
does
involve
a
general
principle
but
it
does
not
involve
the
further
most
exercised
of
jurisdiction
that
might
be
conceived
of.
the
question
is
then
whether
the
government
in
regulation
of
the
land
and
naval
forces
can
encompass
activities
by
soldiers
beyond
what
in
a
narrow
sense
can
be
called
military,
obedience
to
orders,
behavior
information
and
things
like
that.
we
submit
that
there
are
good
reasons
why
this
jurisdiction
should
go
further.
activities,
actions
of
the
kind
in
question
of
this
case
do
have
in
a
very
real
sense
a
military
jurisdiction,
a
military
significance
that
makes
them
a
proper
concern
of
the
military
forces.
the
fundamental
factor
here
is
the
fact
that
the
military
is
and
always
has
been
in
our
society
a
kind
of
a
unique
community
that
is
governed
by
rules
and
customs
of
its
own
and
is
separate
from
the
civilian
community
and
in
some
respects
alien
to
it.
the
real
community
of
the
people
in
the
services
is
the
community
of
other
people
in
the
services.
it's
not
the
civilian
community
where
a
particular
military
base
with
its
transient
personnel
happens
to
be
located.
of
course,
the
existence
of
the
military
unit
in
a
civilian
community
presents
certain
problems
for
that
community.
military
people
in
fact
are
often
a
different
kind
of
--
a
different
make
up
of
ages
and
attitudes.
there
are
frequently
young
people
without
local
ties,
without
family
roots
in
the
community
who
in
their
free
time
do
as
a
matter
of
practical
fact
create
problems
for
that
community
and
i
think
that
that
community
rightly
looks
to
the
military
to
maintain
some
degree
of
control
over
what
these
people
do
in
the
community
and
of
course
a
general
discipline
is
something
that's
of
enormous
significance
to
an
effectively
functioning
army
and
i
think
to
the
extent
that
soldiers
at
sometimes
are
off
duty
what
they
do
during
those
off
duty
hours
does
have
an
impact
on
the
operation
of
the
military
force
and
the
existence
of
an
effective
discipline.
one
factor
involved
in
civilian
punishment
of
military
offenders
against
the
civilian
laws
is
that
those
civilian
punishments,
the
delays
in
civilian
trials
may
well
interfere
with
the
operation
of
a
military
unit
by
making
a
man
unavailable
for
transfer,
unavailable
for
the
performance
of
his
military
duties.
the
army
has
special
facilities,
special
abilities
because
of
the
nature
of
the
community
that
it
is
for
the
punishment
and
the
rehabilitation
of
member
of
the
forces
who
may
have
gone
astray.
in
fact,
because
of
the
possibilities
for
limited
restraint,
it
may
well
be
that
an
appropriate
punishment
for
a
military
man
can
be
much
more
lenient
than
any
punishment
that
would
be
available
to
the
civilian
courts
and
the
civilian
authorities.
finally,
a
point
that
mr.
raboniwitz
has
pointed
to
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
in
fact,
the
articles
of
war
in
general
as
to
most
to
these
current
--
as
to
all
but
two
or
three
simply
say
as
a
matter
of
statute
that
the
punishment
shall
be
as
court-martial
shall
direct.
now,
the
manual
for
court-martial
which
is
in
form
an
executive
order
of
the
president
specifies
maximum
penalties.
generally,
i
believe
not
minimum
penalties.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
under
the
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
under
the
uniform
code,
i
think
in
the
case
of
rape,
i
think
the
code
says
something
about
that.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
of
course
this
is
not
a
rape.
this
in
fact
was
an
attempted
rape
case.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
that,
i'm
sorry,
i
do
not
know,
mr.
justice.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
well,
in
fact,
the
maximum
penalty
available
under
the
military
law
in
this
case
was
25
years.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
no,
i
would
suspect
that
something
of
that
magnitude
which
certainly
have
been
available
under
any
civilian
law
that
i'm
familiar
with.
i
think
there
is
a
very
real
practical
point
here
that
the
factors
that
basically
underlie
the
jury
right,
the
right
of
an
individual
to
be
tried
and
judged
by
members
of
his
community
don't
fully
apply
in
practical
fact
in
the
case
of
a
military
man
who
against
his
will
is
often
dragged
to
a
community
where
he
has
no
ties
or
he
doesn't
want
to
be
in
where
in
fact,
they're
made
for
one
reason
or
another
be
a
strong
community
bias
against
him.
so,
i'm
suggesting,
there
may
be
some
cases
where
in
fact
the
military
man
does
benefit
from
a
military
trial
as
distinguished
from
a
civilian
trial.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
no
i
have
not.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
but
in
fact
i'm
told
and
of
course
this
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
support
this
that
generally
a
comparison
of
the
cases
of
civilian
crimes
tried
by
court-martials
with
those
tried
by
civilian
courts
indicates
that
more
lenient
penalties
are
given
out
generally
by
the
court-martial
and
this
i'm
sure
is
conditioned
by
the
fact
that
a
more
lenient
penalty
can
in
some
cases
be
effective
against
the
military
man
where
that
kind
of
penalty
wouldn't
make
sense
in
the
state.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i'm
sorry.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes
that's
certainly
--
there
are
several
stages
of
review
within
the
military
scheme
and
the
sentences
can
in
fact
be
reviewed
all
the
way
up
to
the
top
within
the
military.
along
this
line,
i
think
it
is
important
to
bear
in
mind
that
the
uniform
code
and
specifically
the
approach
that
has
been
taken
by
the
court
of
military
appeals
does
assure
military
men
virtually
all
of
the
constitutional
rights
that
existing
civil
trials
except
of
course
for
the
requirement
of
indictment
and
the
right
to
a
trial
by
jury.
with
respect
to
the
history
upon
which
the
petitioner
put
so
much
weight,
we
think
that
the
research
that
is
reflected
in
our
brief
does
in
fact
show
that
the
framers
of
the
constitution
were
familiar
with
or
had
reason
to
be
familiar
with
the
fact
that
court-martials
contemporaneously
were
being
used
to
punish
crimes
which
could
not
be
regarded
as
purely
military
in
the
sense
for
which
the
petitioner
contends.
to
be
sure,
some
of
the
crimes
listed
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief,
it
may
be
a
little
hard
to
tell
which
they
were
but
there
are
certainly
a
great
many
of
them
as
to
which
it
is
clear
that
they
were
what
the
petitioner
would
call
non-military
or
civilian
offenses.
for
example,
cashing
a
bad
check
in
a
civilian
restaurant,
rioting
in
town,
fraud,
assault
of
the
civilian,
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
you
simply
can't
say
that
the
provision
in
the
1916
articles
of
war
laying
out
specific
jurisdiction
over
specific
non-military
crimes
were
something
noble.
this
is
something
that
existed
prior
to
the
ratification
of
the
constitution
and
in
fact
existed
over
the
years
under
the
general
article
of
the
articles
of
war
up
until
1916.
so,
it's
not
a
new
jurisdiction.
it's
one
that
must
have
been
on
the
contemplation
of
the
framers.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
in
fact,
this
was
done
by
the
army.
some
of
the
records
--
most
of
them,
i
believe,
appear
in
the
national
archives.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
well,
yes.
generally,
it's
the
national
archives.
at
least
--
there's
one
instance
at
least
where
it's
the
library
at
westpoint
or
some
of
the
records
kept
at
westpoint
but
most
of
these
are
available
in
the
archives.
i
think,
although,
it's
right
to
say
that
this
is
a
case
of
first
impression
in
this
court,
it
is
important
to
consider
this
case
in
the
light
of
the
cases
where
the
court
has
considered
certainly
not
unrelated
question
of
jurisdiction
over
civilians.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes.
though
i
would
--
there
is
perhaps
a
distinction
as
to
the
location
of
the
offense
but
i
would
have
to
submit
that
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
think
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
mr.
justice,
my
only,
--
i
think
conceivably
a
line
could
be
drawn
according
to
whether
the
soldier
in
question
was
stationed
in
the
memphis
community
or
was
stationed
for
example
in
hawaii.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes
i
think
it
does
but
i
can
see
that
a
distinction
could
be
drawn
as
to
the
scope
of
the
jurisdiction
to
govern
and
regulate
the
land
and
naval
forces
according
to
the
geographic
distance
perhaps
between
where
the
individual
was
stationed
and
where
he
commits
his
crimes.
i
think
there
is
a
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
think
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
say
that
the
jurisdiction
extends
that
far
but
i
think
i
can
say,
one
might
say
that
the
government
and
regulation
of
the
land
and
naval
forces
properly
includes
the
relationship
between
a
military
unit
and
the
community
in
which
it
is
located
but
perhaps
not
the
relationship
between
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
no,
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
insisting
on
that
position.
no
i
think
that
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
it
does
not
but
i
could
conceive
that
it
might
to
someone
else.
i
think
one
of
the
problems
in
this
case
of
course
is
if
you
draw,
try
to
draw
a
circle
around
military
offenses,
what
is
a
military
offense?
to
take
the
problem
of
rape,
is
rape
of
a
lack
in
uniform
on
a
military
post,
a
military
offense
or
not?
and
i
think
you
can
play
with
all
of
these
various
factors
and
i
think
the
problem
is
not
an
easy
one
to
find.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
it
certainly
a
question
that
necessarily
follows
from
the
position
that
the
petitioner
is
putting
forth
in
this
case.
some
other
possible
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
well,
i
think
--
i
think
the
constitution
does
have
to
be
read
as
leaving
it
to
the
judgment
of
the
legislature
of
congress
as
to
how
far
this
jurisdiction
shall
extend.
now,
that
there
is
an
absolute
jurisdiction.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
but
i
think
if
you
say
anything
shorter
there,
even
if
you
just
say
as
to
rape
of
a
civilian,
there's
no
jurisdiction,
i
think
you
are
necessarily
in
the
question
of
where
the
line
does
exist.
if
you
say
there
is
no
limit
other
than
the
good
judgment
of
the
legislature,
then
you
don't
have
this
problem
of
course.
but
i
think
it's
not
easy
to
define
what
is
a
military
defense,
military
offense,
even
if
you
try
to
do
it
quite
narrowly.
i
think
that
is
a
problem
that
necessarily
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
that's
certainly
is
mr.
justice.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes
i
do,
though
i
think
we
might
in
this
particular
case
even
come
under
a
less
sweeping
statement
of
the
limit
of
the
jurisdiction.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes
sir,
in
our
position,
that
does
rest
upon
the
existence
of
a
jurisdiction
that
is
limited
only
by
the
good
sense
of
the
legislature
and
of
course
that
i
think
is
--
that
was
the
historical
issue
in
england
i
think
realistically
whether
the
king
should
be
able
to
determine
the
jurisdiction
of
courts-martial
or
whether
parliament
did.
the
one
thing
that
our
constitution
decided
was
that
it
was
the
legislature
and
not
the
executive
which
would
have
the
authority
to
determine
this
jurisdiction
but
i
think
that
the
jurisdiction
given
the
legislature
was
a
broad
one.
of
course
that
although
admittedly
it
was
a
different
issue,
that's
what
this
court
said
in
kinsella
against
singleton.
it
said,
the
test
is
the
status
of
the
accused,
whether
or
not
he
was
a
military
man
when
he
committed
the
crime
and
when
he
was
tried.
i
think
it's
very
hard
to
understand
the
case
decided
at
the
same
as
kinsella
involving
civilian
employees
who
were
by
all
tests
in
affect
operating
as
members
of
the
military
forces.
in
mcelroy
against
guagliardo,
the
court
said
that
although
a
civilian
was
in
this
working
relationship
with
the
jury,
since
he
did
not
have
military
status,
there
was
not
court-martial
jurisdiction
over
him.
i
think
that
any
test
other
than
status
makes
it
very
hard
to
understand
the
distinction
that
was
drawn
in
that
case.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
it's
important
that
in
this
case,
what
we
are
discussing
is
a
constitutional
grant
of
jurisdiction
to
the
congress
to
legislate.
clause
14
of
section
8
of
article
i
provides
that
congress
has
the
jurisdiction
to
make
rules
for
the
government
in
regulation
of
the
land
and
naval
forces.
it's
our
position
that
this
power
permitted
congress
to
legislate
the
specific
provisions
of
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice
upon
which
sergeant
o'callahan
was
convicted.
we
submit
that
congress
does
have
a
concurrent
jurisdiction
with
the
civil
authorities
to
punish
offenses
committed
by
military
personnel
who
are
in
active
military
status
without
limitation
as
to
whether
or
not
the
offenses
are
committed
on
a
military
post
or
on
duty.
in
fact,
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice
and
the
articles
of
war
of
1916
which
in
substances
were
effect
until
1950
when
the
code
was
enacted
had
quite
and
have
quite
detail
provisions
relating
to
so-called
non-military
offenses.
the
code
includes,
of
course,
the
offenses
in
question
in
this
case,
rape
or
attempted
rape,
assault,
house
breaking
and
also
covers
specifically
most
of
the
other
principal
offenses
that
servicemen
might
commit
against
the
civilian
communities
such
as
murder,
larceny,
bad
check
offenses,
drunken
driving,
reckless
driving,
disorderly
conduct,
breech
of
the
peace.
as
mr.
rabinowitz
has
suggested,
this
jurisdiction
has
been
exercised
and
is
being
exercised
in
a
great
many
cases
that
arise
both
in
the
united
states
and
abroad.
in
the
united
states,
there
are
working
arrangements
between
the
military
and
the
civil
authorities,
both
the
department
of
justice
and
state
and
local
authorities
which
divide
up
the
concurring
jurisdiction
that
exists
under
the
uniform
code.
generally
speaking,
the
military
does
turn
offenders
against
the
civil
laws
over
to
the
civil
authorities
if
the
civil
authorities
request
it.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
the
civil
authorities
had
him
and
turned
him
over
to
the
military
police
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
--
who
proceeded
with
the
case.
those
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
well,
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
would
suggest
that
the
test
perhaps
should
be
framed
in
terms
of
the
constitution
with
stops
the
government
and
regulation
of
the
land
and
naval
forces.
we
submit
that
one
aspect
of
the
government
in
regulation
of
the
land
and
naval
forces
is
a
reasonable
amount
of
control
by
those
forces
over
the
behavior
of
their
members
when
they're,
so
to
speak,
turn
loose
on
the
civilian
community
in
which
they're
stationed.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
no,
well,
of
course,
what
i'm
saying
is
that
there
is
an
exclusive
military
jurisdiction.
we
say
that
there
is
a
concurrent
jurisdiction.
this
case
does
not
present
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
the
odds
as
to
what
would
happen
in
that,
i'm
sure
the
case
would
be
handled
by
the
civilian
authorities.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
well,
there
are
--
the
policy
of
the
army
and
of
the
services
is
that
ordinarily
upon
request
offenders
against
the
civilian
laws
will
be
turned
over
to
the
civilian
authorities.
i'm
sure
that
policy
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes
but
i'm
sure
there
are
--
there
would
be
a
request
in
such
a
case.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes.
yes,
that's
certainly
is
the
consequence
of
the
existence
of
this
concurrent
military
jurisdiction.
and
by
85%
of
the
cases
within
the
united
states
in
the
year
1967,
the
civilian
authorities
in
fact
did
take
jurisdiction
over
serious
offenses.
but
there
were
something
like
750
cases,
serious
cases
where
the
military
authorities
did
prosecute
and
there
are
many
war
cases
and
i
believe
much
harder
proportion
of
less
serious
offenses.
overseas
in
1967,
although
our
status
of
forces
agreements
do
give
jurisdiction
to
the
local
authorities
where
american
men
are
stationed
in
almost
all
cases
except
for
cases
involving
only
american
personnel
and
cases
involving
crimes
committed
while
on
duty.
in
those
overseas
cases,
there
were
some
18,000
military
prosecutions
in
the
year
1967,
so
that
we
submit
that
this
is
a
broad
jurisdiction,
a
broadly
exercised
jurisdiction
that's
at
stake.
one
as
to
which
there
are
apparently
smoothly
operating
arrangements
between
civilian
and
military
authorities
and
we
submit
that
the
constitution
does
not
require
this
jurisdiction
to
be
given
up
by
the
military.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
as
for
--
you're
thinking
perhaps
of
the
tax
evasion
case.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
first
of
all,
i
think
that
there
might
well
be
a
statutory
question
there.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i'm
quite
sure
that
was
what
it
was
brought
under
and
not
knowing
the
case.
but
as
i
say,
there
may
be
some
questions
which
i
don't
think
are
raised
in
this
case.
it's
just
how,
how
that
article
could
be
applied.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
but
as
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
think
it
probably
does
mean
that
but
i
think
we
don't
have
to
go
that
far
in
this
case.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
think
that
does
have
to
follow
from
the
broad
language
that's
in
the
constitution
itself.
but
as
i
say,
this
is
a
--
this
case
is
not.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
as
extreme
a
case.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
again,
we
don't
have
a
preclusion
case
here.
that
would
be,
i
think,
of
a
troublesome
case
if
it
were.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
think
i
would
have
to
say
that
if
the
military
or
if
congress
purported
to
preclude
state
jurisdiction
over
some
of
these
crimes
that
would
certainly
be
a
difficult
case.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
think
the
question
here,
is
i
think
framed
and
perhaps
to
my
mind,
should
be
restricted
to
the
question
whether
legislation
can
as
the
plaintiff
asserts,
deprive
the
individual
defendant
of
his
jury
right.
it's
not
a
jurisdictional
fight
between
the
military
authorities
and
the
states.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
well,
i
do
have
to
confess
that
i'm
troubled
and
i
hate
to
make
a
commitment
as
to
the
most
extreme
application
that
this
could
be
given.
it
may
well
be
that
in
certain
areas
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
under
these
articles?
yes,
i
believe
there
is
and
in
fact
the
court
of
military
justice
draw
any
suggestions
from
this
court's
opinion
in
burns
and
wilson
had
said
that
the
constitution
does
in
general
apply
to
the
military
men
and
to
the
procedure
in
military
trials.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
as
to
the
right
to
jury
trial,
i
think
it's
--
it
has
been
established
that
the
grant
to
jurisdiction
to
congress
and
the
clause
14
is
inconsistent
with
it.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
that
is
a
case
which
in
fact
has
within
the
last
couple
of
years
have
risen
in
the
court
of
military
bills,
the
court
of
military
bill
does
held
that
that
right
does
in
fact
exist.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
under
the
constitution?
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes.
the
court
of
military
bills
has
said
as
flatly
i
think
as
could
be
said
that
the
constitution
operates
directly
upon
military.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yeah.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
think
--
i
think
i
would
have
to
say
that
it
would
be
our
position
apparently
to
go
that
far,
though
of
course,
i
would
say
again
that
i
don't
think
it
necessary
to
go
that
far
to
decide
this
case
or
really
the
general
problem
raised
by
this
case.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes
indeed
and
of
course
this
case
does
involve
a
general
principle
but
it
does
not
involve
the
further
most
exercised
of
jurisdiction
that
might
be
conceived
of.
the
question
is
then
whether
the
government
in
regulation
of
the
land
and
naval
forces
can
encompass
activities
by
soldiers
beyond
what
in
a
narrow
sense
can
be
called
military,
obedience
to
orders,
behavior
information
and
things
like
that.
we
submit
that
there
are
good
reasons
why
this
jurisdiction
should
go
further.
activities,
actions
of
the
kind
in
question
of
this
case
do
have
in
a
very
real
sense
a
military
jurisdiction,
a
military
significance
that
makes
them
a
proper
concern
of
the
military
forces.
the
fundamental
factor
here
is
the
fact
that
the
military
is
and
always
has
been
in
our
society
a
kind
of
a
unique
community
that
is
governed
by
rules
and
customs
of
its
own
and
is
separate
from
the
civilian
community
and
in
some
respects
alien
to
it.
the
real
community
of
the
people
in
the
services
is
the
community
of
other
people
in
the
services.
it's
not
the
civilian
community
where
a
particular
military
base
with
its
transient
personnel
happens
to
be
located.
of
course,
the
existence
of
the
military
unit
in
a
civilian
community
presents
certain
problems
for
that
community.
military
people
in
fact
are
often
a
different
kind
of
--
a
different
make
up
of
ages
and
attitudes.
there
are
frequently
young
people
without
local
ties,
without
family
roots
in
the
community
who
in
their
free
time
do
as
a
matter
of
practical
fact
create
problems
for
that
community
and
i
think
that
that
community
rightly
looks
to
the
military
to
maintain
some
degree
of
control
over
what
these
people
do
in
the
community
and
of
course
a
general
discipline
is
something
that's
of
enormous
significance
to
an
effectively
functioning
army
and
i
think
to
the
extent
that
soldiers
at
sometimes
are
off
duty
what
they
do
during
those
off
duty
hours
does
have
an
impact
on
the
operation
of
the
military
force
and
the
existence
of
an
effective
discipline.
one
factor
involved
in
civilian
punishment
of
military
offenders
against
the
civilian
laws
is
that
those
civilian
punishments,
the
delays
in
civilian
trials
may
well
interfere
with
the
operation
of
a
military
unit
by
making
a
man
unavailable
for
transfer,
unavailable
for
the
performance
of
his
military
duties.
the
army
has
special
facilities,
special
abilities
because
of
the
nature
of
the
community
that
it
is
for
the
punishment
and
the
rehabilitation
of
member
of
the
forces
who
may
have
gone
astray.
in
fact,
because
of
the
possibilities
for
limited
restraint,
it
may
well
be
that
an
appropriate
punishment
for
a
military
man
can
be
much
more
lenient
than
any
punishment
that
would
be
available
to
the
civilian
courts
and
the
civilian
authorities.
finally,
a
point
that
mr.
raboniwitz
has
pointed
to
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
in
fact,
the
articles
of
war
in
general
as
to
most
to
these
current
--
as
to
all
but
two
or
three
simply
say
as
a
matter
of
statute
that
the
punishment
shall
be
as
court-martial
shall
direct.
now,
the
manual
for
court-martial
which
is
in
form
an
executive
order
of
the
president
specifies
maximum
penalties.
generally,
i
believe
not
minimum
penalties.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
under
the
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
under
the
uniform
code,
i
think
in
the
case
of
rape,
i
think
the
code
says
something
about
that.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
of
course
this
is
not
a
rape.
this
in
fact
was
an
attempted
rape
case.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
that,
i'm
sorry,
i
do
not
know,
mr.
justice.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
well,
in
fact,
the
maximum
penalty
available
under
the
military
law
in
this
case
was
25
years.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
no,
i
would
suspect
that
something
of
that
magnitude
which
certainly
have
been
available
under
any
civilian
law
that
i'm
familiar
with.
i
think
there
is
a
very
real
practical
point
here
that
the
factors
that
basically
underlie
the
jury
right,
the
right
of
an
individual
to
be
tried
and
judged
by
members
of
his
community
don't
fully
apply
in
practical
fact
in
the
case
of
a
military
man
who
against
his
will
is
often
dragged
to
a
community
where
he
has
no
ties
or
he
doesn't
want
to
be
in
where
in
fact,
they're
made
for
one
reason
or
another
be
a
strong
community
bias
against
him.
so,
i'm
suggesting,
there
may
be
some
cases
where
in
fact
the
military
man
does
benefit
from
a
military
trial
as
distinguished
from
a
civilian
trial.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
no
i
have
not.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
but
in
fact
i'm
told
and
of
course
this
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
support
this
that
generally
a
comparison
of
the
cases
of
civilian
crimes
tried
by
court-martials
with
those
tried
by
civilian
courts
indicates
that
more
lenient
penalties
are
given
out
generally
by
the
court-martial
and
this
i'm
sure
is
conditioned
by
the
fact
that
a
more
lenient
penalty
can
in
some
cases
be
effective
against
the
military
man
where
that
kind
of
penalty
wouldn't
make
sense
in
the
state.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i'm
sorry.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes
that's
certainly
--
there
are
several
stages
of
review
within
the
military
scheme
and
the
sentences
can
in
fact
be
reviewed
all
the
way
up
to
the
top
within
the
military.
along
this
line,
i
think
it
is
important
to
bear
in
mind
that
the
uniform
code
and
specifically
the
approach
that
has
been
taken
by
the
court
of
military
appeals
does
assure
military
men
virtually
all
of
the
constitutional
rights
that
existing
civil
trials
except
of
course
for
the
requirement
of
indictment
and
the
right
to
a
trial
by
jury.
with
respect
to
the
history
upon
which
the
petitioner
put
so
much
weight,
we
think
that
the
research
that
is
reflected
in
our
brief
does
in
fact
show
that
the
framers
of
the
constitution
were
familiar
with
or
had
reason
to
be
familiar
with
the
fact
that
court-martials
contemporaneously
were
being
used
to
punish
crimes
which
could
not
be
regarded
as
purely
military
in
the
sense
for
which
the
petitioner
contends.
to
be
sure,
some
of
the
crimes
listed
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief,
it
may
be
a
little
hard
to
tell
which
they
were
but
there
are
certainly
a
great
many
of
them
as
to
which
it
is
clear
that
they
were
what
the
petitioner
would
call
non-military
or
civilian
offenses.
for
example,
cashing
a
bad
check
in
a
civilian
restaurant,
rioting
in
town,
fraud,
assault
of
the
civilian,
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
you
simply
can't
say
that
the
provision
in
the
1916
articles
of
war
laying
out
specific
jurisdiction
over
specific
non-military
crimes
were
something
noble.
this
is
something
that
existed
prior
to
the
ratification
of
the
constitution
and
in
fact
existed
over
the
years
under
the
general
article
of
the
articles
of
war
up
until
1916.
so,
it's
not
a
new
jurisdiction.
it's
one
that
must
have
been
on
the
contemplation
of
the
framers.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
in
fact,
this
was
done
by
the
army.
some
of
the
records
--
most
of
them,
i
believe,
appear
in
the
national
archives.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
well,
yes.
generally,
it's
the
national
archives.
at
least
--
there's
one
instance
at
least
where
it's
the
library
at
westpoint
or
some
of
the
records
kept
at
westpoint
but
most
of
these
are
available
in
the
archives.
i
think,
although,
it's
right
to
say
that
this
is
a
case
of
first
impression
in
this
court,
it
is
important
to
consider
this
case
in
the
light
of
the
cases
where
the
court
has
considered
certainly
not
unrelated
question
of
jurisdiction
over
civilians.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes.
though
i
would
--
there
is
perhaps
a
distinction
as
to
the
location
of
the
offense
but
i
would
have
to
submit
that
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
think
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
mr.
justice,
my
only,
--
i
think
conceivably
a
line
could
be
drawn
according
to
whether
the
soldier
in
question
was
stationed
in
the
memphis
community
or
was
stationed
for
example
in
hawaii.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes
i
think
it
does
but
i
can
see
that
a
distinction
could
be
drawn
as
to
the
scope
of
the
jurisdiction
to
govern
and
regulate
the
land
and
naval
forces
according
to
the
geographic
distance
perhaps
between
where
the
individual
was
stationed
and
where
he
commits
his
crimes.
i
think
there
is
a
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
think
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
i
say
that
the
jurisdiction
extends
that
far
but
i
think
i
can
say,
one
might
say
that
the
government
and
regulation
of
the
land
and
naval
forces
properly
includes
the
relationship
between
a
military
unit
and
the
community
in
which
it
is
located
but
perhaps
not
the
relationship
between
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
no,
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
insisting
on
that
position.
no
i
think
that
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
it
does
not
but
i
could
conceive
that
it
might
to
someone
else.
i
think
one
of
the
problems
in
this
case
of
course
is
if
you
draw,
try
to
draw
a
circle
around
military
offenses,
what
is
a
military
offense?
to
take
the
problem
of
rape,
is
rape
of
a
lack
in
uniform
on
a
military
post,
a
military
offense
or
not?
and
i
think
you
can
play
with
all
of
these
various
factors
and
i
think
the
problem
is
not
an
easy
one
to
find.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
it
certainly
a
question
that
necessarily
follows
from
the
position
that
the
petitioner
is
putting
forth
in
this
case.
some
other
possible
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
well,
i
think
--
i
think
the
constitution
does
have
to
be
read
as
leaving
it
to
the
judgment
of
the
legislature
of
congress
as
to
how
far
this
jurisdiction
shall
extend.
now,
that
there
is
an
absolute
jurisdiction.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
but
i
think
if
you
say
anything
shorter
there,
even
if
you
just
say
as
to
rape
of
a
civilian,
there's
no
jurisdiction,
i
think
you
are
necessarily
in
the
question
of
where
the
line
does
exist.
if
you
say
there
is
no
limit
other
than
the
good
judgment
of
the
legislature,
then
you
don't
have
this
problem
of
course.
but
i
think
it's
not
easy
to
define
what
is
a
military
defense,
military
offense,
even
if
you
try
to
do
it
quite
narrowly.
i
think
that
is
a
problem
that
necessarily
--
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes,
that's
certainly
is
mr.
justice.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes
i
do,
though
i
think
we
might
in
this
particular
case
even
come
under
a
less
sweeping
statement
of
the
limit
of
the
jurisdiction.
mr.
james
van
r.
springer
yes
sir,
in
our
position,
that
does
rest
upon
the
existence
of
a
jurisdiction
that
is
limited
only
by
the
good
sense
of
the
legislature
and
of
course
that
i
think
is
--
that
was
the
historical
issue
in
england
i
think
realistically
whether
the
king
should
be
able
to
determine
the
jurisdiction
of
courts-martial
or
whether
parliament
did.
the
one
thing
that
our
constitution
decided
was
that
it
was
the
legislature
and
not
the
executive
which
would
have
the
authority
to
determine
this
jurisdiction
but
i
think
that
the
jurisdiction
given
the
legislature
was
a
broad
one.
of
course
that
although
admittedly
it
was
a
different
issue,
that's
what
this
court
said
in
kinsella
against
singleton.
it
said,
the
test
is
the
status
of
the
accused,
whether
or
not
he
was
a
military
man
when
he
committed
the
crime
and
when
he
was
tried.
i
think
it's
very
hard
to
understand
the
case
decided
at
the
same
as
kinsella
involving
civilian
employees
who
were
by
all
tests
in
affect
operating
as
members
of
the
military
forces.
in
mcelroy
against
guagliardo,
the
court
said
that
although
a
civilian
was
in
this
working
relationship
with
the
jury,
since
he
did
not
have
military
status,
there
was
not
court-martial
jurisdiction
over
him.
i
think
that
any
test
other
than
status
makes
it
very
hard
to
understand
the
distinction
that
was
drawn
in
that
case.
