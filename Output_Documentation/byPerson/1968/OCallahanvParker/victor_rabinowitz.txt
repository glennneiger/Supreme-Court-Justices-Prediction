mr.
victor
rabinowitz
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
before
the
court
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
from
the
third
circuit
and
is
limited
to
a
single
legal
issue
which
we
think
is
of
profound
importance
to
several
million
young
americans
now
in
the
armed
forces
of
the
united
states
in
relating
to
the
balance
between
civil
and
military
jurisdiction
over
them.
question
is
a
simple
one.
does
a
court-martial
have
jurisdiction
in
peace
time
to
try
a
member
of
the
armed
forces
charged
with
a
civilian
crime
and
by
that,
i
mean,
a
crime
which
is
normally
cognizable
in
the
civil
courts
alleged
to
have
been
committed
by
him
off
post
and
off
duty.
in
this
case,
the
crime
is
attempted
rape
but
if
the
government
is
right,
it
could
try
a
member
of
the
armed
forces
for
any
crime
at
all
including
securities
violation,
violation
of
the
anti-trust
laws
or
anything
else.
unless
the
court
think
that
this
is
a
far-fetched
example,
i
learned
this
morning
that
a
technical
sergeant
at
myrtle
airbase
in
south
carolina
was
convicted
just
a
few
days
ago
of
the
crime
of
income
tax
evasion
by
a
court-martial.
the
relative
role
of
the
military
in
civilian
government
has
been
of
considerable
concern
throughout
our
history
and
for
that
matter
throughout
the
history
of
england.
under
one
hand,
the
constitution
provides
that
congress
may
make
rules
for
the
government
in
regulation
of
the
land
and
naval
forces.
on
the
other
hand,
it
provides
for
jury
trial
in
an
article
3
court
for
grand
jury
indictment.
in
federal
cases
and
most
states
also
have
similar
provisions,
some
variation
on
the
grand
jury
but
all
of
them
provide
for
a
trial
before
a
civilian
court
and
for
a
jury
trial.
in
this
kind
of
situation,
this
court
has
always
taken
the
position
that
in
order
to
determine
the
relationship
of
these
two
apparently
conflicting
provisions
or
provisions
that
may
conflict
in
our
constitution,
that's
it's
appropriate
to
look
into
the
historical
context,
to
look
at
the
probable
intent
of
the
framers
of
the
constitution
and
to
determine
on
the
basis
of
that
what
rule
shall
apply.
now,
we
differ
somewhat
with
the
government
on
our
view
of
the
history
which
is
not
particularly
surprising
but
as
we
see
the
history,
for
over
a
hundred
years
of
both
before
and
after
the
adoption
of
the
constitution,
court-martial
jurisdiction
was
limited
both
in
this
country
and
in
england
to
offenses
such
as
decision,
mutiny,
striking
or
scorning
a
superior
officer,
tardiness
for
parade,
failure
to
salute,
theft
from
military
stores
and
a
host
of
other
offenses
daring
and
obvious
immediate
relationship
to
the
army,
many
of
which
are
not
punishable
in
the
civilian
courts
at
all.
these
are
the
kind
of
offenses
and
the
only
kind
of
offenses
listed
in
the
articles
of
war
adopted
by
the
continental
congress
in
1775,
renewed
in
1776
and
in
essence,
they
are
the
offenses
for
which
court-martial
jurisdiction
was
provided
in
the
united
states
in
peace
time
up
until
1916.
it
was
in
the
articles
of
1916,
perhaps
an
anticipation
of
another
war,
but
in
any
event,
in
1916,
for
the
first
time,
congress
provided
court-martial
jurisdiction
and
the
articles
of
war
for
the
first
time
defined
crimes
other
than
military
crimes
going
to
offenses
such
as
rape,
murder,
assault
and
similar
ordinary,
conventional
civilian
offenses.
now,
the
framers
of
the
constitution
obviously
did
not
act
in
a
vacuum
as
this
court
has
pointed
out
on
numerous
occasions
both
in
handling
jury
cases
such
as
patton
and
particularly
in
handling
military
law
cases
such
as
covert
against
reid
and
the
many
cases
that
followed
that.
the
people
who
framed
the
constitution
were
quite
aware
of
the
english
revolution.
they
were
aware
of
the
abuses
that
they
themselves
suffered
in
this
very
field
and
it
may
reasonably
be
assumed
that
they
wrote
the
constitution
with
this
in
mind.
english
history
is
i
think
fairly
clear.
in
1627,
the
petitioner
of
right
addressed
to
charles
i,
complained
of
the
institution
of
court-martial
for
any
offense
even
an
offense
trying
a
soldier
if
that
happened
in
the
courts
of
england
where
the
civil
courts
were
open
and
the
petition
was
addressed
to
the
king
because
the
king
had
directed
commissions
to
go
forth
and
to
try
members
of
the
armed
forces
although
the
civilian
courts
according
to
the
petitioner
were
perfectly
capable
of
trying
these
forces,
these
offenses.
as
a
result
to
the
petition
of
right,
king
charles
withdrew
his
military
commissions
but
the
subject
was
a
matter
of
considerable
conflict
between
parliament
and
the
stewards
for
a
good
while
after.
in
1689,
after
the
revolution
of
1688,
parliament
passed
the
mutiny
act
which
for
the
first
time
provided
by
act
of
parliament
at
least,
trial
by
court-martial,
of
people
in
the
armed
forces
and
the
only
three
offenses
that
were
listed
in
the
mutiny
act
were
desertion,
sedition
and
mutiny.
now,
the
act
was
a
very
limited
duration.
the
first
act
was
passed
for
a
single
period,
for
over
a
period
of
one
single
year
and
congress
and
the
parliament
did
over
the
next
century
renewed
the
statute
annually.
each
time
confining
court-martial
jurisdiction
for
crimes
committed
within
england
to
crimes
that
were
clearly
military
in
nature
of
the
type
mentioned
in
the
mutiny
act
of
1689,
the
desertion,
sedition
and
disrespect
to
the
superior
officer,
that
sort
of
thing.
now,
it
is
true
that
as
the
english
empire
expanded
and
england
took
up
commitments
in
foreign
countries
that
court-martial
jurisdiction
was
exercised
over
crimes
committed
by
members
of
the
armed
forces
on
civilians
in
foreign
countries
but
only
in
foreign
countries,
never
in
england.
there
is
some
discussion
in
the
authorities
indicating
and
there's
a
case
in
england
in
about
the
middle
of
the
18th
century
holding
that
whereas
court-martial
jurisdiction
within
england
came
under
the
mutiny
act
and
therefore
within
the
area
of
congresses,
of
the
parliament's
jurisdiction,
court-martial
jurisdiction
oversees
was
within
the
king's
prerogative
and
i
think
that
by
analogy,
we
might
very
well
say
that
whereas
court-martial
jurisdiction
in
the
united
states
in
time
of
peace
is
quite
a
different
thing
from
court-martial
jurisdiction
in
times
of
war.
and
in
time
of
war,
court-martial
--
an
extended
court-martial
jurisdiction
may
perhaps
be
argued
forth
as
coming
within
the
war
power
of
congress.
this
particular
offense
and
the
issue
presented
before
us
was
committed
in
time
of
peace.
it
was
in
1956,
it
was
in
the
territory
of
hawaii,
the
civil
courts
were
open,
there
was
no
war,
it
was
one
of
the
periods
in
our
recent
history
in
which
there
didn't
to
be
a
war
and
the
issue
is
not
an
issue
of
the
war
power
of
congress
but
rather
an
issue
of
the
congress'
power
to
take
away
from
persons
in
the
armed
forces
the
right
of
trial
by
jury
and
the
other
protections
of
the
constitution.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
well,
i
don't
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
i
really
see
no
escape.
i
think
that
the
statute
is
clear.
the
statute
asserts
jurisdiction
over
everybody
in
the
armed
forces
and
i
really
have
difficulty
in
avoiding
the
constitutional
issue.
i
think
and
i'll
come
to
that
in
a
moment
your
honor
that
there
may
be
several
different
views
of
the
constitutional
issue
as
your
honor
suggested
in
the
concurring
opinion
in
covert
but
that
there
is
a
constitutional
issue
here,
it
seems
to
me
is
unavoidable.
now,
when
the
columnist
drew
the
constitution,
it
is
perfectly
obvious
that
this
was
a
matter
of
considerable
importance
to
them.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
declaration
of
independence
contains
a
reference
to
the
fact
in
one
of
the
complaints
listed
against
the
king
was
that
he
had
asserted
military
jurisdiction
over
crimes
committed
by
the
armed
forces,
by
the
english
soldiers
on
civilians
in
the
united
states
or
what
was
then
the
colony.
and
this
was
protested
against
and
i
might
say
that
throughout
history,
there
have
been
two
parallel
lines
here.
under
one
hand,
there
has
been
the
complaint
of
the
civilian
that
the
army
will
take
jurisdiction
and
provide
what
the
constitution
--
what
the
declaration
of
independence
called
a
mock
trial,
thus
permitting
the
military
to
abuse
the
civilians
by
trying
them
in
accordance
with
presumably
more
lenient
rules.
on
the
other
hand,
there
has
been
similar
complain,
i
should
say
opposite
complaint
but
arising
out
of
the
same
context
that
the
army
will
provide
for
the
soldier
a
more
strict
and
a
more
difficult
form
of
punishment
than
he
would
get
in
the
civilian
courts
because
he
does
not
have
in
the
army
right
of
trial
by
jury,
right
to
a
civilian
court
and
the
right
to
a
grand
jury
indictment
and
i
think
the
fact
is
that
both
of
these
things
may
happen
and
it
is
to
avoid
both
of
these
things
that
we
think
civilian
jurisdiction
are
to
be
given.
now,
the
articles
of
war
adopted
in
1776
remained
unchanged
so
far
as
this
particular
subject
is
concerned
until
the
enrolment
act
of
1863
in
the
midst
of
the
civil
war
when
for
the
first
time
congress
passed
a
statute
giving
some
degree
of
military
jurisdiction
over
crimes
committed,
over
civilian
crimes.
that
was
specifically
confined
to
time
of
war
and
this
court
held
in
the
coleman
case
and
in
a
series
of
cases
that
followed
it
that
congress
intended
by
that
statute
to
give
jurisdiction
of
the
military
only
in
cases
where
the
civilian
courts
were
not
operating.
the
leading
case
of
course
is
coleman
against
tennessee
where
the
issue
arose
as
to
who
had
jurisdiction
over
a
crime
committed
by
a
member
of
the
union
forces
in
the
then
occupied
territory
of
tennessee,
there
were
then
no
civilian
courts
operating,
certainly
no
civilian
courts
of
the
united
states.
there
may
have
been
civilian
courts
of
the
confederacy
operating.
the
court
said
it
would
be
absurd
to
say
that
a
soldier
in
the
union
army
could
be
tried
by
a
civilian
federal
court,
by
a
confederate
civilian
court
and
held
that
the
army
had
military
jurisdiction
over
that
crime.
but
this
court
has
repeatedly
since
that
time
interpreted
the
1863
act
applying
only
where
armies
were
actually
in
the
field
and
where
civilian
courts
were
not
open.
as
i
say,
it
was
not
until
1916
that
the
articles
of
war
were
amended
to
cover
the
--
substantially
the
situation
that
we
have
now.
now,
although
this
case
is
one
of
first
impression
and
the
court
has
never
decided
this
precise
issue.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
are
only
three
or
four
decisions
even
in
the
courts
of
appeals
on
this
issue.
the
court
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
no
sir.
i
think
there
are
only
two
circuits
that
have
passed
on
this,
the
third
circuit
and
one
other.
i
don't
recall
which
and
they
both
came
to
the
same
conclusion
without
very
much
of
a
discussion.
i
think
they
just
assumed
that
without
any
constitutional
discussion
at
all
in
any
of
the
cases.
they
merely
went
to
the
articles
of
war,
noted
that
the
articles
of
war
did
give
jurisdiction
over
this
sort
of
offense
and
proceeded
from
that
point.
i
don't
know
of
a
single
case
and
i've
check
the
records
where
they're
available
where
any
of
these
was
raised
by
counsel.
now,
in
the
tough
case,
in
covert
against
reid
and
kinsella
against
singleton
and
mcelroy
case
and
lee
against
madigan
and
a
whole
series
of
cases
that
were
decided,
most
of
them
after
the
second
world
war.
the
court
touched
upon
a
similar
issue.
discussed
not
testified
--
discussed
at
very
great
length
on
some
of
the
issue
namely
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court-martial
over
people
who
were
not
members
of
the
armed
forces
and
the
history
is
quite
familiar
to
this
court
and
i
won't
go
into
those
cases
now
except
to
note
that
there
was
one
theme
which
it
seems
to
me
ran
through
all
of
those
cases
and
that
was
the
very
deep
concern
shown
by
all
of
the
members
of
the
court
to
prevent
too
broad
an
extension
of
military
jurisdiction.
and
the
court
felt
that
unlike
the
commerce
clause
or
other
provisions
of
the
constitution,
which
have
been
given
a
very
broad
interpretation
that
here
so
far
as
this
clause
was
concerned,
the
constitution
would
be
given
a
very
narrow
interpretation
and
that
view,
as
i
say,
was
expressed
in
the
--
in
covert
against
reid
where
the
court
said
every
extension
of
military
jurisdiction
is
an
encroachment
on
the
jurisdiction
of
the
civil
courts
and
more
important,
acts
as
a
deprivation
of
the
right
to
jury
trial
and
other
treasured
constitutional
protection.
in
lee
against
madigan,
also,
the
court
indicated
its
reluctance
to
give
military
tribunals
authority
to
try
people
for
non-military
offenses
and
so
we
are
face
to
face
with
this
problem
now
and
it
seems
to
us
that
on
the
basis
of
the
history
that
we
have
before
us
there
is
no
justification
for
extending
jurisdiction
of
the
court-martial
over
persons
who
try
ordinary,
conventional,
civilian
crimes
where
the
courts
are
open,
perfectly
capable
of
handling
the
case
where
there
are
no
extraordinary
circumstance
such
as
war
or
some
similar
event
to
make
it
impossible
for
these
people
to
be
handed
over
to
the
civilian
courts
for
trial
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
government
in
its
brief
says
that
some
80%
of
these
cases
are
tried
in
the
civilian
courts
but
apparently
there
are
20%
that
are
not.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
well,
if
our
military
offenses
we
mean
this
sort
of
thing
which
is
directly
and
immediately
concerned
with
the
military,
yes.
in
peace
or
war,
i
would
say
that
there
is
a
long
tradition
of
court-martial
jurisdiction.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
well,
i
would
argue
if
i
had
to
that
if
the
crime
is
committed
in
this
country
where
the
civilian
courts
are
open
and
are
available
that
they
ought
to
be
tried
in
the
civilian
courts
in
that
case
also
because
i
don't
see
any
particular
reason
why
a
soldier
who
is
drunk
and
disorderly
in
a
camp
in
the
united
states
should
be
tried
by
a
military
court
just
because
there
happens
to
be
a
war
5000
miles
away.
so
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
as
long
as
they
are
non-military
crimes,
yes,
i
would
say,
they
should
all
be
treated
the
same.
now,
it
is
obvious
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
if
they
go
into
town
and
they
get
drunk
and
there's
a
fight.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
i
don't
see
that
it
makes
any
difference.
i
don't
see
any
reason
why
the
civil
courts
aren't
perfectly
capable
of
handling
that
kind
of
situation.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
i
think
the
army
has
an
interest
and
not
just
as
i
think
that
the
army
has
an
interest
in
same
toward
the
wives
of
soldiers,
servicemen,
stationed
abroad
don't
kill
their
husbands.
i
think
the
army
has
an
interest
in
that.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
pardon
me.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
i
don't
think
that
that
really
should
be
the
decisive
issue
in
determining
whether
or
not
a
man
is
to
be
deprived
of
a
jury
trial
and
the
other
protection
of
a
civilian
trial.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
so.
i
admit
that
a
line
has
to
be
drawn
somewhere
and
that
seems
to
be
a
reasonable
way
to
draw
the
line.
i
can
understand
that
on
the
post
there
are
lots
of
things
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
no,
i
don't
think
i
would
draw
the
line
on
whether
he's
in
uniform.
i'm
sure
that
sergeant
whatever
his
name
was,
was
probably
in
uniform
when
he
filled
out
a
forced
income
tax
return
but
i
don't
think
that
that
has
to
do
--
determines
the
question
as
to
whether
he
should
be
tried
in
a
civilian
--
in
a
civilian
court
or
not.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
yes,
well,
so
far
the
cases
have
all
revolved
on
the
question
of
the
status
of
the
offender.
in
this
case,
i
suppose,
it
might
be
said
that
the
issue
is
the
nature
of
the
offense
as
to
whether
it's
what
we've
been
calling
a
military
offense
or
a
civilian
offense.
now,
i
will
admit
in
response
to
what
justice
marshall
said
that
there
is
an
area
--
any
areas,
there
isn't
almost
all
legal
questions
which
is
marginal
but
if
i
had
to
draw
the
line,
i
would
say
that
if
it
is
committed
off
post,
it
may
be
committed
a
thousand
miles
from
post.
it
may
be
committed
on
time
square.
i
don't
think
that
there
is
any
reason
why
the
civilian
authorities
cannot
try
such
a
case
and
why
such
a
white
persons
engaged
in
that
kind
of
a
brawl
in
or
out
of
uniform
should
not
be
subjected
to
the
military,
to
the
civilian
authority.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
well,
i
think
that's
a
much
more
difficult
problem.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
and
i'm
--
i
would
say
that
there
is
a
much
better
argument
for
court-martial
jurisdiction
there.
although
even
there,
as
your
honor
may
know,
in
many,
many
cases,
these
matters
are
determined
--
let
me
just
interrupt
one
more.
i
assume
that
what
we
are
talking
about
is
when
you
say
in
time
of
peace,
we're
not
talking
about
the
united
states
army
as
an
occupying
force.
we're
rather
talking
about
american
troops
stationed
at
an
air
base
in
germany
for
example
or
something.
there's
a
difference
where
the
army
is
in
even
though
it
may
be
technically
in
time
of
peace
where
the
army
is
in
this
as
a
military
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
yes
and
that's
right.
but
where
the
--
in
most
cases,
i
believe
this
matter
is
handled
now,
currently,
is
handled
by
treaty.
there
is
no
doubt
that
if
we
look
at
this
historically,
the
united
states
has
always
asserted
the
right
to
try
people
who
commit
crimes
abroad
by
--
in,
well,
by
techniques,
by
message
other
than
civilian
trial
and
the
whole
in
re
ross
and
in
schiller
cases,
controversy
was
involved
in
that
and
that
also
was
i
think
affected
to
some
extent
by
covert
against
reid.
i
would
be
inclined
to
think
and
i
think
this
is
a
matter
of
policy
perhaps
rather
than
a
constitutional
matter
or
perhaps
the
constitutional
matter
as
well
that
under
such
cases,
the
civilian
courts
of
the
country
in
which
the
crime
is
committed
should
try
the
case.
but
that
is
not
this
case
and
i
really
can't
explore
all
of
these
problems
to
there
outer
limits
because
i
think
that
the
facts
do
vary
from
time
to
time
and
as
a
matter
of
policy
and
as
a
matter
of
treaty
law,
i
do
think
that
in
most
cases,
these
persons
are
tried
in
the
courts
of
the
country
in
which
the
crime
is
committed.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
i
think
that
is
probably
so.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
yes
sir,
if
we
all
assume
that
in
re
ross,
it's
no
longer
the
law,
i
think
that
is
probable.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
constitutional
right
to
a
jury
trial
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
yes
sir,
it's
my
understanding
that
almost
all
of
these
situations
are
covered
by
treaties.
i
think
some
of
them
are
mentioned
in
the
government's
brief.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
well,
if
i
gave
anything
up,
your
honor,
with
an
over
sought
side.
i
didn't
intend
to
--
i
intend
to
give
out
anything
up
but
there
are
of
course
provisions
in
the
statutes
providing
for
the
trial
in
the
united
states
of
crimes
which
are
committed
abroad.
now,
of
course,
what
has
to
be
a
crime
against
the
united
states
and
if
an
american
--
well,
let's
see
the
hypothesis
that
we're
making
here.
we're
assuming
that
an
american
soldier
for
example
assaults
or
steals
money
from
an
english
civilian
or
from
a
german
civilian,
he
being
stationed
there.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
it
might
not
even
be
a
crime
against
the
united
states,
yes
sir.
now,
i
--
the
government
doesn't
agree
--
doesn't
agree
with
this
analysis
at
all.
it
takes
the
position
that
under
the
general
article
of
the
articles
of
war
which
is
set
forth
at
page
5
of
my
brief.
court-martials
have
always
tried
civilian
crimes,
always
from
the
very
beginning.
the
article
says
although
not
specifically
mentioned
in
this
chapter,
all
disorders
and
neglects
to
the
prejudice
of
good
order
and
discipline
in
the
armed
forces.
all
conduct
of
a
nature
to
being
discredit
upon
the
armed
forces
and
crimes
and
offenses
not
capital
may
be
subjected
to
a
general
or
summary
court-martial
and
i
must
say
that
the
tax
evasion
case
that
i
referred
to
a
few
moments
ago
was
tried
under
this
section.
now,
i'm
not
going
to
raise
the
question
of
whether
that
section
isn't
so
vague
that
it
could
hardly
be
upheld
today
but
the
citations,
the
references
quoted
by
the
government
and
it
was
really
a
magnificent
bit
of
research,
all
115
cases
or
so
listed
in
the
appendix
are
suppose
to
be
cases
in
which
the
general
article
was
used
to
punish
civilian
crimes.
now,
they
start
in
1775
and
for
example
the
first
one
is
that
a
soldier
was
charged
with
stealing
and
the
next
one
says,
a
soldier
robbed
dr.
foster,
general
hospital,
the
third
one
says,
soldier
stole
a
hat
from
captain
waterman
(ph).
now,
these
descriptions
are
so
brief
that
you
can't
tell
it
all
whether
the
men
were
on
duty
or
off
duty
at
the
time
of
the
offense.
one
thing
we
can
be
sure,
that
the
civilian
courts
were
not
open
because
these
crimes
took
place
in
general
washington's
army
in
1775
in
cambridge,
the
first
one,
three
weeks
after
the
battle
of
bunker's
hill.
in
1776
in
new
york,
in
1777
in
morristown,
in
1778
at
valleywood
at
friedrichsburg,
a
new
york
town
and
then
after
the
treaty
of
paris,
they
moved
to
the
frontier
where
there
are
series
of
offenses
against
indians.
now,
no
one
is
talking
about
the
kind
of
a
case
where
the
army
is
on
the
military
--
in
the
course
of
a
military
campaign
in
the
united
states
or
where
there's
a
frontier
battle
going
on.
those
situations
are
--
there
are
no
resemblances
at
all
to
the
situation
and
i
think
we're
then
talking
about
the
war
power,
we
have
a
situation
which
is
really
quite
different.
i
might
say
that
winthrop
in
his
authoritative
work
comes
to
a
completely
different
conclusion
with
respect
to
the
general
article.
he
says,
it
was
never
used
except
very,
very
sporadically
on
the
frontier
but
aside
from
that,
it
was
never
used
except
to
punish
offenses
of
a
military
nature.
now,
if
the
history
is
not
conclusive,
then
mindful
of
mr.
justice
harlan's
concurrence
in
covert,
i
would
like
just
to
note
this.
in
that
opinion,
the
justice
said
that
the
crucial
question
is
and
i
quote
“which
guarantees
of
the
constitution
should
apply
in
view
of
the
particular
circumstances,
the
practical
necessities
and
the
possible
alternatives
which
congress
had
before
it?”
now,
while
that
might
have
been
a
closed
question
in
cases
like
covert
and
kinsella,
there's
nothing
close
about
it
here.
the
particular
circumstances
of
the
cases
--
case
is
that
a
soldier
goes
off
base,
off
duty,
commits
a
crime
against
a
civilian
in
hawaii.
there's
no
reason
at
all
why
hawaiian
court
can't
try
him.
the
practical
necessities
are
exactly
the
same
and
the
possible
alternatives
are
obvious.
no
reason,
no
compelling
reason
in
policy,
no
reason
why
the
constitution
should
not
apply
appeals
in
this
case.
now,
here
of
course,
the
government
also
disagrees.
it
says,
the
right
of
the
soldier
to
be
tried
in
the
army
community,
that's
the
community
he
lives
in
and
that's
the
community
he
should
be
tried
in.
well,
i
wonder
whether
an
average,
non-commissioned
officer
tried
by
a
court-martial
consisting
of
ranking
officers,
senior
officers
frequently
officers
with
the
rank
of
colonel
or
major
or
captain
is
being
tried
“in
the
army
community”.
the
government
says,
there
may
be
different
standards
in
the
army.
well,
of
course,
there
may
be
different
standards
in
the
army.
that's
precisely
what
the
difficulty
is.
if
the
standards
in
the
army
are
more
strict
than
the
standards
in
the
community
at
large,
then
the
soldier,
we
think,
has
a
right
to
complain
because
he
committed
his
crime
in
the
community
and
not
in
the
army.
and
if
the
standards
in
the
army
are
less
strict
than
we
think
that
the
community
has
a
right
to
complain
because
the
soldier
should
not
be
permitted
to
come
into
town,
into
the
civilian
community,
commit
crimes
and
then
be
excused
because
the
army
doesn't
think
those
crimes
are
very
serious.now,
there's
one
other
point
--
well,
i
would
just
refer
your
honors
to
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
just
very
briefly
and
that
was
raised
in
point
two
of
my
brief
namely,
some
question
as
to
whether
congress
has
the
power
to
punish
this
crime
at
all
or
in
other
words,
the
crime
as
the
crime
of
rape.
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
that
talks
about
rape
in
connection
with
military
and
rape
is
a
crime
which
is
normally
punished
by
the
state
and
the
mere
fact
that
a
man
happens
to
be
in
the
armed
forces
would
not
seem
to
me
to
give
the
government
the
right
to
punish
him
before
he
commits
rape,
to
put
it
in
another
way,
and
as
i
say,
developed
in
the
brief.
congress
can
make
it
a
crime
to
embezzle
property
of
the
united
states
but
i
do
not
think
that
congress
could
make
it
a
crime
which
said
that
anyone
who
is
a
federal
employee
and
who
commits
embezzlement
anywhere
is
guilty
of
a
federal
crime
and
i
think
that's
what
has
been
attempted
here.
this
is
discussed
in
the
mason
case
where
the
court
discusses
a
crime
of
murder
in
these
circumstances
and
i
rest
on
that.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
before
the
court
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
from
the
third
circuit
and
is
limited
to
a
single
legal
issue
which
we
think
is
of
profound
importance
to
several
million
young
americans
now
in
the
armed
forces
of
the
united
states
in
relating
to
the
balance
between
civil
and
military
jurisdiction
over
them.
question
is
a
simple
one.
does
a
court-martial
have
jurisdiction
in
peace
time
to
try
a
member
of
the
armed
forces
charged
with
a
civilian
crime
and
by
that,
i
mean,
a
crime
which
is
normally
cognizable
in
the
civil
courts
alleged
to
have
been
committed
by
him
off
post
and
off
duty.
in
this
case,
the
crime
is
attempted
rape
but
if
the
government
is
right,
it
could
try
a
member
of
the
armed
forces
for
any
crime
at
all
including
securities
violation,
violation
of
the
anti-trust
laws
or
anything
else.
unless
the
court
think
that
this
is
a
far-fetched
example,
i
learned
this
morning
that
a
technical
sergeant
at
myrtle
airbase
in
south
carolina
was
convicted
just
a
few
days
ago
of
the
crime
of
income
tax
evasion
by
a
court-martial.
the
relative
role
of
the
military
in
civilian
government
has
been
of
considerable
concern
throughout
our
history
and
for
that
matter
throughout
the
history
of
england.
under
one
hand,
the
constitution
provides
that
congress
may
make
rules
for
the
government
in
regulation
of
the
land
and
naval
forces.
on
the
other
hand,
it
provides
for
jury
trial
in
an
article
3
court
for
grand
jury
indictment.
in
federal
cases
and
most
states
also
have
similar
provisions,
some
variation
on
the
grand
jury
but
all
of
them
provide
for
a
trial
before
a
civilian
court
and
for
a
jury
trial.
in
this
kind
of
situation,
this
court
has
always
taken
the
position
that
in
order
to
determine
the
relationship
of
these
two
apparently
conflicting
provisions
or
provisions
that
may
conflict
in
our
constitution,
that's
it's
appropriate
to
look
into
the
historical
context,
to
look
at
the
probable
intent
of
the
framers
of
the
constitution
and
to
determine
on
the
basis
of
that
what
rule
shall
apply.
now,
we
differ
somewhat
with
the
government
on
our
view
of
the
history
which
is
not
particularly
surprising
but
as
we
see
the
history,
for
over
a
hundred
years
of
both
before
and
after
the
adoption
of
the
constitution,
court-martial
jurisdiction
was
limited
both
in
this
country
and
in
england
to
offenses
such
as
decision,
mutiny,
striking
or
scorning
a
superior
officer,
tardiness
for
parade,
failure
to
salute,
theft
from
military
stores
and
a
host
of
other
offenses
daring
and
obvious
immediate
relationship
to
the
army,
many
of
which
are
not
punishable
in
the
civilian
courts
at
all.
these
are
the
kind
of
offenses
and
the
only
kind
of
offenses
listed
in
the
articles
of
war
adopted
by
the
continental
congress
in
1775,
renewed
in
1776
and
in
essence,
they
are
the
offenses
for
which
court-martial
jurisdiction
was
provided
in
the
united
states
in
peace
time
up
until
1916.
it
was
in
the
articles
of
1916,
perhaps
an
anticipation
of
another
war,
but
in
any
event,
in
1916,
for
the
first
time,
congress
provided
court-martial
jurisdiction
and
the
articles
of
war
for
the
first
time
defined
crimes
other
than
military
crimes
going
to
offenses
such
as
rape,
murder,
assault
and
similar
ordinary,
conventional
civilian
offenses.
now,
the
framers
of
the
constitution
obviously
did
not
act
in
a
vacuum
as
this
court
has
pointed
out
on
numerous
occasions
both
in
handling
jury
cases
such
as
patton
and
particularly
in
handling
military
law
cases
such
as
covert
against
reid
and
the
many
cases
that
followed
that.
the
people
who
framed
the
constitution
were
quite
aware
of
the
english
revolution.
they
were
aware
of
the
abuses
that
they
themselves
suffered
in
this
very
field
and
it
may
reasonably
be
assumed
that
they
wrote
the
constitution
with
this
in
mind.
english
history
is
i
think
fairly
clear.
in
1627,
the
petitioner
of
right
addressed
to
charles
i,
complained
of
the
institution
of
court-martial
for
any
offense
even
an
offense
trying
a
soldier
if
that
happened
in
the
courts
of
england
where
the
civil
courts
were
open
and
the
petition
was
addressed
to
the
king
because
the
king
had
directed
commissions
to
go
forth
and
to
try
members
of
the
armed
forces
although
the
civilian
courts
according
to
the
petitioner
were
perfectly
capable
of
trying
these
forces,
these
offenses.
as
a
result
to
the
petition
of
right,
king
charles
withdrew
his
military
commissions
but
the
subject
was
a
matter
of
considerable
conflict
between
parliament
and
the
stewards
for
a
good
while
after.
in
1689,
after
the
revolution
of
1688,
parliament
passed
the
mutiny
act
which
for
the
first
time
provided
by
act
of
parliament
at
least,
trial
by
court-martial,
of
people
in
the
armed
forces
and
the
only
three
offenses
that
were
listed
in
the
mutiny
act
were
desertion,
sedition
and
mutiny.
now,
the
act
was
a
very
limited
duration.
the
first
act
was
passed
for
a
single
period,
for
over
a
period
of
one
single
year
and
congress
and
the
parliament
did
over
the
next
century
renewed
the
statute
annually.
each
time
confining
court-martial
jurisdiction
for
crimes
committed
within
england
to
crimes
that
were
clearly
military
in
nature
of
the
type
mentioned
in
the
mutiny
act
of
1689,
the
desertion,
sedition
and
disrespect
to
the
superior
officer,
that
sort
of
thing.
now,
it
is
true
that
as
the
english
empire
expanded
and
england
took
up
commitments
in
foreign
countries
that
court-martial
jurisdiction
was
exercised
over
crimes
committed
by
members
of
the
armed
forces
on
civilians
in
foreign
countries
but
only
in
foreign
countries,
never
in
england.
there
is
some
discussion
in
the
authorities
indicating
and
there's
a
case
in
england
in
about
the
middle
of
the
18th
century
holding
that
whereas
court-martial
jurisdiction
within
england
came
under
the
mutiny
act
and
therefore
within
the
area
of
congresses,
of
the
parliament's
jurisdiction,
court-martial
jurisdiction
oversees
was
within
the
king's
prerogative
and
i
think
that
by
analogy,
we
might
very
well
say
that
whereas
court-martial
jurisdiction
in
the
united
states
in
time
of
peace
is
quite
a
different
thing
from
court-martial
jurisdiction
in
times
of
war.
and
in
time
of
war,
court-martial
--
an
extended
court-martial
jurisdiction
may
perhaps
be
argued
forth
as
coming
within
the
war
power
of
congress.
this
particular
offense
and
the
issue
presented
before
us
was
committed
in
time
of
peace.
it
was
in
1956,
it
was
in
the
territory
of
hawaii,
the
civil
courts
were
open,
there
was
no
war,
it
was
one
of
the
periods
in
our
recent
history
in
which
there
didn't
to
be
a
war
and
the
issue
is
not
an
issue
of
the
war
power
of
congress
but
rather
an
issue
of
the
congress'
power
to
take
away
from
persons
in
the
armed
forces
the
right
of
trial
by
jury
and
the
other
protections
of
the
constitution.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
well,
i
don't
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
i
really
see
no
escape.
i
think
that
the
statute
is
clear.
the
statute
asserts
jurisdiction
over
everybody
in
the
armed
forces
and
i
really
have
difficulty
in
avoiding
the
constitutional
issue.
i
think
and
i'll
come
to
that
in
a
moment
your
honor
that
there
may
be
several
different
views
of
the
constitutional
issue
as
your
honor
suggested
in
the
concurring
opinion
in
covert
but
that
there
is
a
constitutional
issue
here,
it
seems
to
me
is
unavoidable.
now,
when
the
columnist
drew
the
constitution,
it
is
perfectly
obvious
that
this
was
a
matter
of
considerable
importance
to
them.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
declaration
of
independence
contains
a
reference
to
the
fact
in
one
of
the
complaints
listed
against
the
king
was
that
he
had
asserted
military
jurisdiction
over
crimes
committed
by
the
armed
forces,
by
the
english
soldiers
on
civilians
in
the
united
states
or
what
was
then
the
colony.
and
this
was
protested
against
and
i
might
say
that
throughout
history,
there
have
been
two
parallel
lines
here.
under
one
hand,
there
has
been
the
complaint
of
the
civilian
that
the
army
will
take
jurisdiction
and
provide
what
the
constitution
--
what
the
declaration
of
independence
called
a
mock
trial,
thus
permitting
the
military
to
abuse
the
civilians
by
trying
them
in
accordance
with
presumably
more
lenient
rules.
on
the
other
hand,
there
has
been
similar
complain,
i
should
say
opposite
complaint
but
arising
out
of
the
same
context
that
the
army
will
provide
for
the
soldier
a
more
strict
and
a
more
difficult
form
of
punishment
than
he
would
get
in
the
civilian
courts
because
he
does
not
have
in
the
army
right
of
trial
by
jury,
right
to
a
civilian
court
and
the
right
to
a
grand
jury
indictment
and
i
think
the
fact
is
that
both
of
these
things
may
happen
and
it
is
to
avoid
both
of
these
things
that
we
think
civilian
jurisdiction
are
to
be
given.
now,
the
articles
of
war
adopted
in
1776
remained
unchanged
so
far
as
this
particular
subject
is
concerned
until
the
enrolment
act
of
1863
in
the
midst
of
the
civil
war
when
for
the
first
time
congress
passed
a
statute
giving
some
degree
of
military
jurisdiction
over
crimes
committed,
over
civilian
crimes.
that
was
specifically
confined
to
time
of
war
and
this
court
held
in
the
coleman
case
and
in
a
series
of
cases
that
followed
it
that
congress
intended
by
that
statute
to
give
jurisdiction
of
the
military
only
in
cases
where
the
civilian
courts
were
not
operating.
the
leading
case
of
course
is
coleman
against
tennessee
where
the
issue
arose
as
to
who
had
jurisdiction
over
a
crime
committed
by
a
member
of
the
union
forces
in
the
then
occupied
territory
of
tennessee,
there
were
then
no
civilian
courts
operating,
certainly
no
civilian
courts
of
the
united
states.
there
may
have
been
civilian
courts
of
the
confederacy
operating.
the
court
said
it
would
be
absurd
to
say
that
a
soldier
in
the
union
army
could
be
tried
by
a
civilian
federal
court,
by
a
confederate
civilian
court
and
held
that
the
army
had
military
jurisdiction
over
that
crime.
but
this
court
has
repeatedly
since
that
time
interpreted
the
1863
act
applying
only
where
armies
were
actually
in
the
field
and
where
civilian
courts
were
not
open.
as
i
say,
it
was
not
until
1916
that
the
articles
of
war
were
amended
to
cover
the
--
substantially
the
situation
that
we
have
now.
now,
although
this
case
is
one
of
first
impression
and
the
court
has
never
decided
this
precise
issue.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
are
only
three
or
four
decisions
even
in
the
courts
of
appeals
on
this
issue.
the
court
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
no
sir.
i
think
there
are
only
two
circuits
that
have
passed
on
this,
the
third
circuit
and
one
other.
i
don't
recall
which
and
they
both
came
to
the
same
conclusion
without
very
much
of
a
discussion.
i
think
they
just
assumed
that
without
any
constitutional
discussion
at
all
in
any
of
the
cases.
they
merely
went
to
the
articles
of
war,
noted
that
the
articles
of
war
did
give
jurisdiction
over
this
sort
of
offense
and
proceeded
from
that
point.
i
don't
know
of
a
single
case
and
i've
check
the
records
where
they're
available
where
any
of
these
was
raised
by
counsel.
now,
in
the
tough
case,
in
covert
against
reid
and
kinsella
against
singleton
and
mcelroy
case
and
lee
against
madigan
and
a
whole
series
of
cases
that
were
decided,
most
of
them
after
the
second
world
war.
the
court
touched
upon
a
similar
issue.
discussed
not
testified
--
discussed
at
very
great
length
on
some
of
the
issue
namely
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court-martial
over
people
who
were
not
members
of
the
armed
forces
and
the
history
is
quite
familiar
to
this
court
and
i
won't
go
into
those
cases
now
except
to
note
that
there
was
one
theme
which
it
seems
to
me
ran
through
all
of
those
cases
and
that
was
the
very
deep
concern
shown
by
all
of
the
members
of
the
court
to
prevent
too
broad
an
extension
of
military
jurisdiction.
and
the
court
felt
that
unlike
the
commerce
clause
or
other
provisions
of
the
constitution,
which
have
been
given
a
very
broad
interpretation
that
here
so
far
as
this
clause
was
concerned,
the
constitution
would
be
given
a
very
narrow
interpretation
and
that
view,
as
i
say,
was
expressed
in
the
--
in
covert
against
reid
where
the
court
said
every
extension
of
military
jurisdiction
is
an
encroachment
on
the
jurisdiction
of
the
civil
courts
and
more
important,
acts
as
a
deprivation
of
the
right
to
jury
trial
and
other
treasured
constitutional
protection.
in
lee
against
madigan,
also,
the
court
indicated
its
reluctance
to
give
military
tribunals
authority
to
try
people
for
non-military
offenses
and
so
we
are
face
to
face
with
this
problem
now
and
it
seems
to
us
that
on
the
basis
of
the
history
that
we
have
before
us
there
is
no
justification
for
extending
jurisdiction
of
the
court-martial
over
persons
who
try
ordinary,
conventional,
civilian
crimes
where
the
courts
are
open,
perfectly
capable
of
handling
the
case
where
there
are
no
extraordinary
circumstance
such
as
war
or
some
similar
event
to
make
it
impossible
for
these
people
to
be
handed
over
to
the
civilian
courts
for
trial
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
government
in
its
brief
says
that
some
80%
of
these
cases
are
tried
in
the
civilian
courts
but
apparently
there
are
20%
that
are
not.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
well,
if
our
military
offenses
we
mean
this
sort
of
thing
which
is
directly
and
immediately
concerned
with
the
military,
yes.
in
peace
or
war,
i
would
say
that
there
is
a
long
tradition
of
court-martial
jurisdiction.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
well,
i
would
argue
if
i
had
to
that
if
the
crime
is
committed
in
this
country
where
the
civilian
courts
are
open
and
are
available
that
they
ought
to
be
tried
in
the
civilian
courts
in
that
case
also
because
i
don't
see
any
particular
reason
why
a
soldier
who
is
drunk
and
disorderly
in
a
camp
in
the
united
states
should
be
tried
by
a
military
court
just
because
there
happens
to
be
a
war
5000
miles
away.
so
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
as
long
as
they
are
non-military
crimes,
yes,
i
would
say,
they
should
all
be
treated
the
same.
now,
it
is
obvious
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
if
they
go
into
town
and
they
get
drunk
and
there's
a
fight.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
i
don't
see
that
it
makes
any
difference.
i
don't
see
any
reason
why
the
civil
courts
aren't
perfectly
capable
of
handling
that
kind
of
situation.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
i
think
the
army
has
an
interest
and
not
just
as
i
think
that
the
army
has
an
interest
in
same
toward
the
wives
of
soldiers,
servicemen,
stationed
abroad
don't
kill
their
husbands.
i
think
the
army
has
an
interest
in
that.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
pardon
me.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
i
don't
think
that
that
really
should
be
the
decisive
issue
in
determining
whether
or
not
a
man
is
to
be
deprived
of
a
jury
trial
and
the
other
protection
of
a
civilian
trial.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
so.
i
admit
that
a
line
has
to
be
drawn
somewhere
and
that
seems
to
be
a
reasonable
way
to
draw
the
line.
i
can
understand
that
on
the
post
there
are
lots
of
things
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
no,
i
don't
think
i
would
draw
the
line
on
whether
he's
in
uniform.
i'm
sure
that
sergeant
whatever
his
name
was,
was
probably
in
uniform
when
he
filled
out
a
forced
income
tax
return
but
i
don't
think
that
that
has
to
do
--
determines
the
question
as
to
whether
he
should
be
tried
in
a
civilian
--
in
a
civilian
court
or
not.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
yes,
well,
so
far
the
cases
have
all
revolved
on
the
question
of
the
status
of
the
offender.
in
this
case,
i
suppose,
it
might
be
said
that
the
issue
is
the
nature
of
the
offense
as
to
whether
it's
what
we've
been
calling
a
military
offense
or
a
civilian
offense.
now,
i
will
admit
in
response
to
what
justice
marshall
said
that
there
is
an
area
--
any
areas,
there
isn't
almost
all
legal
questions
which
is
marginal
but
if
i
had
to
draw
the
line,
i
would
say
that
if
it
is
committed
off
post,
it
may
be
committed
a
thousand
miles
from
post.
it
may
be
committed
on
time
square.
i
don't
think
that
there
is
any
reason
why
the
civilian
authorities
cannot
try
such
a
case
and
why
such
a
white
persons
engaged
in
that
kind
of
a
brawl
in
or
out
of
uniform
should
not
be
subjected
to
the
military,
to
the
civilian
authority.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
well,
i
think
that's
a
much
more
difficult
problem.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
and
i'm
--
i
would
say
that
there
is
a
much
better
argument
for
court-martial
jurisdiction
there.
although
even
there,
as
your
honor
may
know,
in
many,
many
cases,
these
matters
are
determined
--
let
me
just
interrupt
one
more.
i
assume
that
what
we
are
talking
about
is
when
you
say
in
time
of
peace,
we're
not
talking
about
the
united
states
army
as
an
occupying
force.
we're
rather
talking
about
american
troops
stationed
at
an
air
base
in
germany
for
example
or
something.
there's
a
difference
where
the
army
is
in
even
though
it
may
be
technically
in
time
of
peace
where
the
army
is
in
this
as
a
military
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
yes
and
that's
right.
but
where
the
--
in
most
cases,
i
believe
this
matter
is
handled
now,
currently,
is
handled
by
treaty.
there
is
no
doubt
that
if
we
look
at
this
historically,
the
united
states
has
always
asserted
the
right
to
try
people
who
commit
crimes
abroad
by
--
in,
well,
by
techniques,
by
message
other
than
civilian
trial
and
the
whole
in
re
ross
and
in
schiller
cases,
controversy
was
involved
in
that
and
that
also
was
i
think
affected
to
some
extent
by
covert
against
reid.
i
would
be
inclined
to
think
and
i
think
this
is
a
matter
of
policy
perhaps
rather
than
a
constitutional
matter
or
perhaps
the
constitutional
matter
as
well
that
under
such
cases,
the
civilian
courts
of
the
country
in
which
the
crime
is
committed
should
try
the
case.
but
that
is
not
this
case
and
i
really
can't
explore
all
of
these
problems
to
there
outer
limits
because
i
think
that
the
facts
do
vary
from
time
to
time
and
as
a
matter
of
policy
and
as
a
matter
of
treaty
law,
i
do
think
that
in
most
cases,
these
persons
are
tried
in
the
courts
of
the
country
in
which
the
crime
is
committed.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
i
think
that
is
probably
so.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
yes
sir,
if
we
all
assume
that
in
re
ross,
it's
no
longer
the
law,
i
think
that
is
probable.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
constitutional
right
to
a
jury
trial
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
yes
sir,
it's
my
understanding
that
almost
all
of
these
situations
are
covered
by
treaties.
i
think
some
of
them
are
mentioned
in
the
government's
brief.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
well,
if
i
gave
anything
up,
your
honor,
with
an
over
sought
side.
i
didn't
intend
to
--
i
intend
to
give
out
anything
up
but
there
are
of
course
provisions
in
the
statutes
providing
for
the
trial
in
the
united
states
of
crimes
which
are
committed
abroad.
now,
of
course,
what
has
to
be
a
crime
against
the
united
states
and
if
an
american
--
well,
let's
see
the
hypothesis
that
we're
making
here.
we're
assuming
that
an
american
soldier
for
example
assaults
or
steals
money
from
an
english
civilian
or
from
a
german
civilian,
he
being
stationed
there.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
it
might
not
even
be
a
crime
against
the
united
states,
yes
sir.
now,
i
--
the
government
doesn't
agree
--
doesn't
agree
with
this
analysis
at
all.
it
takes
the
position
that
under
the
general
article
of
the
articles
of
war
which
is
set
forth
at
page
5
of
my
brief.
court-martials
have
always
tried
civilian
crimes,
always
from
the
very
beginning.
the
article
says
although
not
specifically
mentioned
in
this
chapter,
all
disorders
and
neglects
to
the
prejudice
of
good
order
and
discipline
in
the
armed
forces.
all
conduct
of
a
nature
to
being
discredit
upon
the
armed
forces
and
crimes
and
offenses
not
capital
may
be
subjected
to
a
general
or
summary
court-martial
and
i
must
say
that
the
tax
evasion
case
that
i
referred
to
a
few
moments
ago
was
tried
under
this
section.
now,
i'm
not
going
to
raise
the
question
of
whether
that
section
isn't
so
vague
that
it
could
hardly
be
upheld
today
but
the
citations,
the
references
quoted
by
the
government
and
it
was
really
a
magnificent
bit
of
research,
all
115
cases
or
so
listed
in
the
appendix
are
suppose
to
be
cases
in
which
the
general
article
was
used
to
punish
civilian
crimes.
now,
they
start
in
1775
and
for
example
the
first
one
is
that
a
soldier
was
charged
with
stealing
and
the
next
one
says,
a
soldier
robbed
dr.
foster,
general
hospital,
the
third
one
says,
soldier
stole
a
hat
from
captain
waterman
(ph).
now,
these
descriptions
are
so
brief
that
you
can't
tell
it
all
whether
the
men
were
on
duty
or
off
duty
at
the
time
of
the
offense.
one
thing
we
can
be
sure,
that
the
civilian
courts
were
not
open
because
these
crimes
took
place
in
general
washington's
army
in
1775
in
cambridge,
the
first
one,
three
weeks
after
the
battle
of
bunker's
hill.
in
1776
in
new
york,
in
1777
in
morristown,
in
1778
at
valleywood
at
friedrichsburg,
a
new
york
town
and
then
after
the
treaty
of
paris,
they
moved
to
the
frontier
where
there
are
series
of
offenses
against
indians.
now,
no
one
is
talking
about
the
kind
of
a
case
where
the
army
is
on
the
military
--
in
the
course
of
a
military
campaign
in
the
united
states
or
where
there's
a
frontier
battle
going
on.
those
situations
are
--
there
are
no
resemblances
at
all
to
the
situation
and
i
think
we're
then
talking
about
the
war
power,
we
have
a
situation
which
is
really
quite
different.
i
might
say
that
winthrop
in
his
authoritative
work
comes
to
a
completely
different
conclusion
with
respect
to
the
general
article.
he
says,
it
was
never
used
except
very,
very
sporadically
on
the
frontier
but
aside
from
that,
it
was
never
used
except
to
punish
offenses
of
a
military
nature.
now,
if
the
history
is
not
conclusive,
then
mindful
of
mr.
justice
harlan's
concurrence
in
covert,
i
would
like
just
to
note
this.
in
that
opinion,
the
justice
said
that
the
crucial
question
is
and
i
quote
“which
guarantees
of
the
constitution
should
apply
in
view
of
the
particular
circumstances,
the
practical
necessities
and
the
possible
alternatives
which
congress
had
before
it?”
now,
while
that
might
have
been
a
closed
question
in
cases
like
covert
and
kinsella,
there's
nothing
close
about
it
here.
the
particular
circumstances
of
the
cases
--
case
is
that
a
soldier
goes
off
base,
off
duty,
commits
a
crime
against
a
civilian
in
hawaii.
there's
no
reason
at
all
why
hawaiian
court
can't
try
him.
the
practical
necessities
are
exactly
the
same
and
the
possible
alternatives
are
obvious.
no
reason,
no
compelling
reason
in
policy,
no
reason
why
the
constitution
should
not
apply
appeals
in
this
case.
now,
here
of
course,
the
government
also
disagrees.
it
says,
the
right
of
the
soldier
to
be
tried
in
the
army
community,
that's
the
community
he
lives
in
and
that's
the
community
he
should
be
tried
in.
well,
i
wonder
whether
an
average,
non-commissioned
officer
tried
by
a
court-martial
consisting
of
ranking
officers,
senior
officers
frequently
officers
with
the
rank
of
colonel
or
major
or
captain
is
being
tried
“in
the
army
community”.
the
government
says,
there
may
be
different
standards
in
the
army.
well,
of
course,
there
may
be
different
standards
in
the
army.
that's
precisely
what
the
difficulty
is.
if
the
standards
in
the
army
are
more
strict
than
the
standards
in
the
community
at
large,
then
the
soldier,
we
think,
has
a
right
to
complain
because
he
committed
his
crime
in
the
community
and
not
in
the
army.
and
if
the
standards
in
the
army
are
less
strict
than
we
think
that
the
community
has
a
right
to
complain
because
the
soldier
should
not
be
permitted
to
come
into
town,
into
the
civilian
community,
commit
crimes
and
then
be
excused
because
the
army
doesn't
think
those
crimes
are
very
serious.now,
there's
one
other
point
--
well,
i
would
just
refer
your
honors
to
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
just
very
briefly
and
that
was
raised
in
point
two
of
my
brief
namely,
some
question
as
to
whether
congress
has
the
power
to
punish
this
crime
at
all
or
in
other
words,
the
crime
as
the
crime
of
rape.
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
that
talks
about
rape
in
connection
with
military
and
rape
is
a
crime
which
is
normally
punished
by
the
state
and
the
mere
fact
that
a
man
happens
to
be
in
the
armed
forces
would
not
seem
to
me
to
give
the
government
the
right
to
punish
him
before
he
commits
rape,
to
put
it
in
another
way,
and
as
i
say,
developed
in
the
brief.
congress
can
make
it
a
crime
to
embezzle
property
of
the
united
states
but
i
do
not
think
that
congress
could
make
it
a
crime
which
said
that
anyone
who
is
a
federal
employee
and
who
commits
embezzlement
anywhere
is
guilty
of
a
federal
crime
and
i
think
that's
what
has
been
attempted
here.
this
is
discussed
in
the
mason
case
where
the
court
discusses
a
crime
of
murder
in
these
circumstances
and
i
rest
on
that.
