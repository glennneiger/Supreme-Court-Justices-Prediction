mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
mr.
chief
justice,
mr.
justices
of
the
court,
may
it
please
the
court.
at
counsel
table
with
me
is
alan
schwartz,
a
member
of
the
bar
of
the
state
of
new
york.
first,
i
would
like
to
clear
up
a
typographical
error
that
appears
in
our
brief
on
page
19.
the
error
was
discovered
too
late
to
change.
it
was
discovered
while
the
messenger
was
delivering
these
briefs
to
the
court
and
he
misunderstood
the
direction.
on
page
19,
it
should
be
november
1967,
the
1968
should
be
crossed
out
and
november
should
be
left
instead
of
1968
being
crossed
out.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
yes,
and
this
is
required
by
the
district
court's
opinion
at
page
16.
although,
appellant
does
not
make
the
argument
today
here
in
oral
argument
that
the
appellee
must
cross
appeal
if
he
would
question
the
basis
on
which
the
lower
court
decided
a
case.
some
suggestion
was
contained
in
his
reply
brief
to
that
principle.
we
would
only
cite
the
court
to
these
cases
letulle
versus
scofield
308
united
states
415,
lucas
versus
alexander
279
united
states
573,
and
the
langnes
versus
green
282
u.s.
531.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
letulle
versus
scofield
308
u.s.
415.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
the
proposition
that
an
appellee
may
argue
any
--
may
use
any
argument
to
support
in
order
of
a
trial
court
even
if
that
order
is
--
even
if
the
argument
is
inconsistent
with
the
basis
for
the
order.
the
ohio
election
laws
require
that
a
candidate
for
president
must
be
nominated
by
a
national
political
convention
to
which
delegates
have
been
selected
in
an
ohio
primary.
in
ohio,
in
order
to
qualify
as
a
primary
--
as
a
new
political
party,
the
group
seeking
to
qualify
must
present
signatures
of
15%
of
the
total
vote
of
those
voting
in
the
last
gubernatorial
election.
these
requirements
reasonably
protect
a
valid
state
interest.
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
at
any
given
time
there's
a
substantial
number
of
disaffected
people,
disaffected
with
the
candidates
or
the
programs
of
the
two
major
parties.
this
group
is
obviously
issue
oriented
and
by
signing
an
independent
nominating
petition,
they
are
at
most
expressing
some
adherence
to
a
principle.
in
the
interest
of
preventing
any
would
be
candidate
or
leader
from
coming
in
and
grabbing
this
group
without
a
contest.
the
ohio
law
requires
that
the
candidate
submit
himself
to
a
primary
election.
this
gives
the
disaffected,
this
more
or
less
cohesive
group
the
right
to
choose
its
candidate
just
as
the
primary
laws
give
the
members
of
the
republican
and
democrat
parties
the
right
to
choose
their
leader.
the
15%
required
dovetails
with
this
primary
requirement
by
preventing
a
would
be
leader
from
coming
in
circulating
qualifying
petitions
obtaining
only
a
few
numbers
and
thus
limiting
those
who
would
vote
in
the
primary
to
those
signing.
of
course,
he
would
select
the
people
who
would
be
expected
to
support
his
candidacy.
another
would
be
leader
with
parallel
political
philosophy
might
be
deterred
by
the
initial
filing
from
filing
another
qualifying
petition.
this
would
--
the
requirement
that
a
primary
be
held
supports
the
logical
state
interest
in
preventing
a
disaffected
group
from
splintering
itself.
it
prevents
--
it
aids
the
disaffected
in
reasonable
go
of
remaining
to
some
extent
cohesive.
so,
they
might
be
affected
and
in
addition,
the
state
has
an
interest
in
knowing
the
extent
of
the
disaffection
so
that
it
may
accommodate
this
disaffection
within
the
system
if
that
is
possible.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
because
the
splintering
distorts
your
honor
the
effect
and
weight
of
the
disaffected
group
by
--
is
the
state
interest
is
in
political
parties
or
the
voters?
the
state
is
interested
at
both
political
parties
and
voters
but
also
it's
in
--
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
i'm
sorry,
i
did
not
mean
splinter
from
a
party,
it
splinter
from
the
initial
candidate
that
has
filed
to
accommodate
himself
to
the
disaffection.
the
state
has
an
interest
in
maintaining
the
disaffection
in
such
a
form
that
it's
not
distorted,
it's
not
splintered
but
this
is
not
the
party,
it's
the
disaffected
group.
so
the
state
may
know
the
extent
of
the
disaffection.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
disaffected
from
the
two
major
qualified
parties
or
any
number
of
qualified
parties.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
that's
true
your
honor
and
we
--
in
the
state
of
ohio
would
seek
to
preserve
the
right
of
these
people
to
select
their
candidate.
but
we
also
want
to
prevent
any
would
be
candidate
from
coming
in
and
grabbing
the
support
of
the
whole
group
just
because
he's
first.
that
is
the
interest
that
the
state
seeks
to
preserve
through
the
primary
requirement
in
the
15%
requirement.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
it
would
certainly
provide
an
interruption
but
more
significantly
it
would
--
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
yes,
your
honor.
pursuant
to
mr.
justice
stewart's
temporary
order,
the
state
has
put
itself
in
a
position
that
it
can
comply
with
an
order
of
this
court.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
that's
correct.
in
this
case,
it
is
not.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
yes,
your
honor
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
certainly.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
oh!
clearly
your
honor
as
quickly
as
this
court
can
decide
but
i
would
say
that
if
--
that
if
a
decision
is
made
by
the
15th
of
october,
it
is
my
understanding
that
the
state
can
comply
with
the
order
whatever
it
is.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
yes,
your
honor
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
the
three-judge
court
found
that
probably
as
early
as
1964
and
certainly
by
november
1967
the
appellants
had
been
fully
briefed
by
the
secretary
of
state
and
as
to
the
requirements
for
ballot
position
in
ohio.
consequently,
that
the
appellants
had
adequate
time
after
november
1967
to
file
a
declaratory
judgment
action
questioning
the
ohio
statutes
which
they
feel
are
invalid.
and
if
that
had
been
done
and
if
these
statutes
have
been
determined
to
be
invalid
there
would
have
been
time
for
the
ohio
general
assembly
to
reconsider
the
laws
and
amend
them
to
comply
with
any
order
which
would
hold
--
which
would've
held
these
laws
invalid.
it
would've
preserve
the
requirement
of
a
primary
by
one
man
or
another
or
in
the
alternative
the
court
could've
adopted
a
procedure
for
this
one
election
which
would've
satisfied
all
the
objections
that
they
might
have
found
in
the
ohio
election
procedure.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
no,
your
honor
there
hasn't.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
no,
your
honor,
the
state
of
ohio
does
not
maintain
that
it
is
impossible.
we
firmly
believe
that
it
is
possible
to
comply
with
the
requirements
but
nevertheless
pursuant
to
the
authority
of
article
ii,
section
1,
clause
2,
the
state
of
ohio
is
given
plenary
power
to
establish
--
to
appoint
presidential
electors
in
any
manner
it
may
direct.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
we
have
trouble
with
the
order
of
--
the
decision
and
order
of
the
lower
court
and
i
do
not
believe
that
order
is
clear
what
findings
they
did
in
fact
to
me.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
we
don't
believe
so
but
again
there
is
some
ambiguity.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
the
question
of
the
extent
of
the
power
of
article
ii
is
--
has
not
been
decided
because
of
the
dearth
of
cases
considering
this.
however,
it
is
not
our
position
that
the
exercise
of
article
ii
power
was
--
is
without
any
limitation
at
all.
we
recognize
that
the
state
must
comply
with
constitutional
commands
specific
constitutional
commands
but
the
thing
that
we
argue
--
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
the
constitutional
--
the
commands
of
the
first
amendment
as
it
is
--
as
it
applies
to
the
state
pursuant
to
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
we
--
the
state
of
ohio
--
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
equal
protection
after
--
well,
first,
the
state
is
not
--
the
state
legislature
is
not
required
to
have
an
election
and
that
is
clear
after
mcpherson
versus
blacker
and
this
was
affirmed
as
recently
as
1951
in
ray
versus
blair
in
this
court.
but
if
the
court
--
if
the
state
legislature
is
not
required
to
have
an
election
at
all
when
it
does
have
an
election
--
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
when
the
argument
broke
for
the
luncheon
recess,
i
was
considering
the
application
of
the
equal
protection
clause
to
the
article
ii
powers
vested
in
state
legislatures.
we
agree
that
the
equal
protection
clause
may
very
well
apply
some
limitation
to
the
power
of
the
state
legislatures
to
direct
the
appointment,
the
manner
of
the
appointment
of
presidential
electors.
we
believe
that
that
power
may
be
limited
in
such
a
respect
that
the
state
legislatures
could
not
disqualify
anyone
from
being
an
elector
on
the
basis
of
race.
however,
no
claim
has
been
made
that
the
ohio
procedures
violate
these
kinds
of
equal
protection
guarantees.
we
do
deny
however
that
there
is
any
limitation
on
the
legislature's
power
based
on
the
principle
that
electors
should
be
chosen
on
the
basis
of
popular
support
of
candidates.
this
--
the
mcpherson
case
recognized
and
appellants
can
see
that
the
legislature
has
the
right
to
appoint
electors.
when
the
legislature
does
appoint
directly,
it
cannot
appoint
on
the
basis
of
popular
support
for
the
simple
reason
it
doesn't
know
the
popular
support,
no
election
having
been
had.
the
argument
is
could
be
made
however
that
once
an
election
is
held
that
some
other
kind
of
equal
protection
limitation
suddenly
appears.
equal
protection
is
not
particularly
applicable
to
elections.
it
applies
equally
to
the
legislature
when
it
appoints
directly
or
when
it
holds
an
election.
there's
no
reason
in
--
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
not
on
the
equal
protection,
your
honor.
both
must
fail
on
the
equal
protection
because
equal
protection
is
not
applicable.
however,
in
a
situation
where
there
is
no
right
to
have
a
vote
but
a
vote
is
nevertheless
had
for
example,
the
situation
in
georgia
where
the
--
this
court
in
fortson
held
that
there
is
no
constitutional
right
for
the
governor
of
a
state
to
be
elected
by
popular
election.
nevertheless,
gray
would
suggest
that
there
is
some
kind
of
limitation
based
on
equal
protection
that
applies
to
this
situation.
however,
this
other
kind
of
equal
protection
is
not
representative
government
for
if
it
were,
how
can
this
court
explain
fortson
when
although
the
election
was
not
required
to
be
held.
when
it
was
held,
this
court
allowed
the
legislature
to
disregard
the
result
of
that
vote
and
select
the
candidate
receiving
the
least
popular
votes.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
no
your
honor,
i'm
not
saying
that
i'm
saying
that
there
are,
there
may
be
some
requirements
--
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
they
are
required
to
honor
some
of
the
guarantees
contained
an
equal
protection
race,
religion,
belief
but
they
are
not
required
to
hold
the
election
on
an
equal
protection
basis
of
representative
government
or
any
theory
that
the
electors
chose
unless
be
the
result
of
popular
support
of
the
candidate
because
in
the
fortson
versus
morris
case
it's
impossible
to
reach
that
result.
the
election
was
held,
the
--
this
court
allowed
the
legislature
of
georgia
to
select
the
candidate
not
receiving
the
most
popular
votes.
representative
government
in
this
situation
such
in
dissimilar,
analogous
situation
of
the
right
of
the
legislature
to
select
presidential
electors
and
the
additional
provision
that
they
need
not
have
an
election
requires
that
if
an
election
is
held
it
has
to
meet
certain
constitutional
equal
protection
safeguards.
we
cannot
discriminate
against
the
voter.
we
can
only
discriminate
against
the
right
of
the
voter
to
have
his
candidate,
have
a
chance
to
win
which
is
exactly
what
happened
in
the
fortson
versus
morris
case
in
this
court.
going
back
to
the
reasonableness
of
the
laws
of
ohio
we
would
suggest
an
additional
reason
for
the
requirement
that
a
primary
be
held
and
the
requirement
of
15%
support
and
that
is
the
experience
in
ohio
in
the
years
1944
and
1948
and
the
presidential
electors
--
elections
in
those
years.
the
elections
were
very
close
in
both
years.
a
third
party
by
taking
support
away
from
one
of
the
two
major
parties
who
had
a
chance
to
win
the
election
could
distort
the
result
of
the
election
in
ohio
by
giving
the
entire
electoral
votes
of
ohio
to
the
least
popular
candidate.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
there's
no
question
it
can
your
honor
and
we
believe
that
any
state
can
provide
against
that.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
the
state
legislature
pursuant
to
article
ii
has
not
limited
that
but
has
provided
that
in
order
to
participate,
there
must
be
a
showing
of
the
possibility
of
substantial
political
effectiveness,
that's
the
15%
requirement.
it's
a
balancing
by
the
state
of
the
competing
interest,
one,
the
interest
in
not
distorting
the
popular
vote
of
those
who
may
win
and
giving
some
voice
to
the
party
that
may
be
effective
though
it
can't
win.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
that
is
a
legislature
--
legislative
problem
your
honor
and
of
course
i
would
defend
it
if
the
legislature
passed
it
but
that
is
certainly
not
a
judicial
question
that
can
be
answered.
there
are
no
constitutional
standards.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
because
--
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
because
your
honor
the
court
--
the
legislature
is
not
required
to
have
an
election
at
all
and
when
it
does
--
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
it
would
still
be
our
position
that
article
ii,
section
1,
clause
2
authorizes
the
legislature
to
have
that
kind
of
requirement.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
some
parts
of
the
equal
protection
clause
apply.
we
could
not
disenfranchise
voters
from
voting
in
the
election.
this
would
be
gray
versus
sanders.
we
have
to
give
the
wallace
people
or
any
other
people
the
right
to
vote
in
the
election
if
we're
having
it.
all
we
can
do
is
control
the
candidates
who
are
going
to
be
submitted
for
the
reason
that
we
have
the
absolute
right
to
make
this
election
ourselves
in
the
legislature.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
for
the
purpose
of
selecting
presidential
electors?
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
yes,
your
honor,
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
yes.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
no,
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
no
your
honor,
i
do
not
believe
there
is
a
distinction
based
on
the
power
of
article
ii
and
the
plenary
power
that
the
legislatures
have
whether
or
not
it's
an
individual
candidate
or
a
party
(voice
overlap).
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
no
your
honor,
we
believe
that
the
state
of
ohio
was
acting
reasonably
with
respect
to
the
candidate
too
for
the
reason
that
the
state
has
a
legitimate
interest
in
protecting
against
the
distortion
of
the
popular
vote
against
the
two
candidates
having
a
chance
to
win.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
a
presidential
candidate,
your
honor?
no,
there
is
no
way
that
a
presidential
candidate
nor
his
electors
can
participate
in
the
presidential
election
in
ohio
except
through
a
party
primary
and
a
party
ballot.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
i
think
of
that
question
we're
better
be
left
to
cancel
--
counsel
for
appellant
because
i
don't
know
what
they're
doing.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
let
me
say
that
if
the
ohio
ballots
are
required
to
be
reprinted
with
the
different
name
for
vice
president,
we
are
now
too
late
to
accomplish
the
result.
it
is
too
late;
we
are
too
far
down
the
road
to
change
the
ballot
to
that
extent.
the
ballots
have
been
printed
and
put
in
a
preparatory
form
to
comply
with
any
possible
order
of
this
court
pursuant
to
your
order
but
we
can't
come
up
with
a
new
name.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
it's
pursuant
to
mr.
justice
stewart's
order.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
so
far
as
we
know.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
well,
that
that
is
another
question
your
honor.
we
feel
that
probably
the
presidential
electors
once
they
are
chosen
are
not
bound
by
names
appearing
on
the
ballot
but
we
admit
we
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
question.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
we
don't
know
the
answer.
this
court
has
not
decided
it,
we
don't
know.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
only
as
of
the
time
they're
nominated
by
convention
which
is
another
thing
--
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
an
elector
may
be
free,
yes.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
no,
we
--
well,
there
might
be
--
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
yes,
that's
correct
your
honor.
although,
it
may
be
a
provision
of
state
law
i
guess
we
feel
that
there
is
a
serious
question
about
its
enforceability.
we
base
--
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
the
conflict
of
possible
conflict
between
the
rights,
duties
and
authorities
of
electors
under
the
federal
constitution
and
the
rights
of
--
and
the
requirements
of
law
binding
them.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
i've
been
advised
by
my
co-counsel
that
there
is
a
requirement
by
such
a
requirement
ohio
law.
it
was
one
with
which
i
was
not
familiar.
we've
based
much
of
our
case
on
the
authority
of
article
ii
but
even
if
it
does,
it
didn't
exist
appellants
could
not
prevail
on
this
appeal.
although,
one
man,
one
vote
is
an
applicable
standard
for
judging
legislative
apportionment
cases.
it
does
not
answer
the
questions
raised
by
the
interrelationship
and
the
interaction
of
third
party
candidates
in
presidential
politics.
history
shows
us
that
third
party
candidates
do
not
win
presidential
elections
in
ohio.
therefore,
--
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
history
shows
us
that
third
party
candidates
do
not
win
the
presidential
electors
in
this
country.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
the
question
i
would
suggest
your
honor
is,
is
this
court
prepared
to
make
the
judgment
that
they
can
or
they
cannot?
again,
this
is
a
problem
that
this
court
faces.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
the
question
isn't
the
right
of
the
citizen
to
vote
--
the
right
of
the
legislature
to
place
qualifications
in
the
in
the
path
of
one
seeking
to
be
in
the
ballot.
the
--
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
yes,
they
do.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
yes
your
honor,
they
do
pursuant
to
article
ii.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
yes,
insofar
as
they
could
not
have
election,
they
can
limit
it
--
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
well,
that
case
is
not
before
this
court.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
but
the
state
certainly
doesn't
do
that
and
there
may
very
well
be
some
first
amendment
guarantee
which
would
apply,
which
would
prevent
the
state
from
doing
that.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
they
can't,
that's
our
position.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
the
effect
on
the
electoral
process
of
third
parties
lies
in
the
territory
of
a
cohesive
minority
can
exert
over
major
parties.
does
the
standard
of
representative
government
require
that
a
tyrannical
minority
can
sway
and
affect
the
positions
taken
by
major
parties,
and
is
this
good
or
bad?
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
this
--
no,
i
didn't
use
the
word
“radical”
but
--
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
tyrannical.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
the
question
the
court
faces
is
whether
it's
restricted
at
all.
the
court
must
answer
whether
there's
any
standard
by
which
it
can
--
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
we're
trying
--
i
think
the
state
is
reasonably
trying
to
stop
the
exercise
of
a
tyranny
by
minority
parties
on
major
parties
for
example,
in
israel
--
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
yes.
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
that's
correct
your
honor
and
a
good
example
--
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
the
good
example
--
a
good
example
is
the
situation
that
we
know
exists
in
israel
a
very
small
--
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
yes,
your
honor.
and
if
it
can
exist
in
israel
today
it
could've
existed
in
ohio
in
the
early
1950's,
a
small
religious
party
in
israel
requires
the
two
major
parties
to
conform
with
its
religious
philosophy
--
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
it
would
be
the
same
if
this
kind
of
thing
happened
in
the
state
of
ohio
and
what
i'm
suggesting
is
this
court
does
not
have
a
standard
to
answer
the
question
whether
this
is
good
or
bad.
and
certainly,
the
standard
of
representative
government
does
not
answer
this
question.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
representative
government
does
not,
cannot
answer
this
question
whether
a
tyranny
--
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
not
for
presidential
electors,
your
honor.
the
article
ii
power
would
exclude
the
right
to
make
this
restriction.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
well,
the
answer
--
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
yes,
that's
true
but
the
answer
to
this
kind
of
unfairness
in
the
legislature
is
electing
a
new
legislature
and
when
the
legislature
is
elected
by
one
man,
one
vote
we
can
be
reasonably
sure
that
this
kind
of
thing
will
not
happen.
finally,
where
do
we
get
the
idea
the
representative
government
applies
to
presidential
politics
when
the
whole
process
is
not
representative.
the
electors
are
selected
in
the
states
as
a
unit.
the
popular
vote
frequently
differs
from
the
electoral
vote
and
certainly
there's
no
mathematical
coalition.
again,
one
man,
one
vote
does
not
apply.
there
is
a
further
distortion
by
the
provision
that
each
state
gets
two
electoral
votes
for
each
senator,
thereby,
increasing
the
representation
of
the
smallest
state
over
the
larger
states.
if
there
is
no
majority
in
the
electoral
college
and
the
election
goes
to
the
house
of
representative
the
winners
are
decided
on
the
basis
of
each
state
having
one
vote
and
this
is
certainly
over
states
or
over
emphasizes
the
political
representation
of
the
smallest
states.
and
finally,
they
--
the
electoral
college
may
choose
or
the
house
of
representatives
may
choose
among
the
three
highest
candidates.
it
is
not
limited
to
the
highest.
so,
the
value
of
one
man,
one
vote
doesn't
apply.
since
it
is
not
a
part
of
the
system,
since
the
electoral
collegiate
principle
does
not
include
representative
government
why
must
we
say
that
any
one
part
of
it
must.
for
these
reasons,
one
that
the
ohio
--
that
the
ohio
general
assembly
has
given
broad
clarity
power
pursuant
to
article
ii
for
the
question
that
this
court
really
doesn't
have
standards
to
answer
the
questions
involved
in
the
interrelationship
between
third
parties
and
presidential
politics.
for
the
reason
that
the
ohio
laws
are
reasonable
and
are
reasonably
designed
to
accomplish
a
valid
objective.
and
finally,
that
the
cases
in
this
court
show
definitely
that
although
when
an
election
is
not
required
to
be
held,
if
it
is
held
it
must
have
some
fairness
but
that
does
not
include
the
right
to
maximize
or
equalize
the
chance
of
the
voters
candidate
winning
and
i
again
emphasize
fortson
versus
morris
for
these
reasons,
this
court
should
affirm
the
order
of
the
united
states
district
court.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
yes,
your
honor.
first,
if
--
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
--
if
this
petitioners
had
questions
about
ohio
election
laws,
these
other
laws
that
have
been
referred
to.
first,
let
me
say
that
they
do
not
relate
to
third
parties.
the
district
court
did
not
find
they're
related
to
third
parties.
the
ohio
supreme
court
in
beck
versus
hummel
says
that
the
ohio
election
laws
will
be
liberality
construed
and
that
this
court
should
probably
not
consider
initially
the
constitutionality
of
the
election
laws
not
considered
by
the
court
below.
if
they
had
questions
about
these
laws,
they
should've
filed
the
declaratory
judgment
action
sometime
prior
to
february
of
1968.
further,
if
they
were
clear
about
what
the
laws
required
they
should've
gone
out
and
gotten
signatures
on
their
petitions
prior
to
the
filing
date
which
was
sometime
in
february
1967
to
qualify
their
party
as
a
political
party
in
ohio.
at
the
same
time,
they
could've
encouraged
people
who
were
signing
these
petitions
to
run
for
county
committees
and
state
committees.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
that's
correct
your
honor.
but
i
was
just
outlining
the
procedure
that
they
should've
followed
if
they
had
done
everything
that
need
be
done.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
if
the
requirement
that
a
party
in
ohio
must
have
a
primary,
a
party
primary
to
get
on
the
ballot
then
clearly
they
would've
had
to
file
the
petitions
sometime
in
february
1968
because
it
would
be
impossible
for
a
party
--
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
well,
that
certainly
unreasonably
delayed
and
then
necessary
delayed
their
action.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
well,
insofar
as
the
district
court
did
not
consider
these
questions
did
not
decide
they
were
unconstitutional.
it's
not
for
this
court
but
as
a
representative
of
the
attorney
general
of
ohio.
i'm
telling
you
that
these
requirements
other
requirements
of
law
fairly
read
do
not
deny
ballot
position
to
third
parties
or
make
it
impossible
for
third
parties
to
qualify.
and
therefore,
if
it's
not
impossible
it's
not
--
they
could
have
done
it
and
they
could've
done
it
last
spring.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
there
has
been
no
question
of
that
provision
your
honor
and
i
would
suggest
that
yes
it
is
reasonable,
certainly
it's
reasonable.
thank
you.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
that's
correct
your
honor.
but
that
again
is
one
of
the
things
that
is
required
to
get
on
the
ballot
in
ohio,
one
of
the
requirements
that
the
ohio
general
assembly
has
provided
pursuant
to
the
ground
authority
in
article
ii,
section
1,
clause
2.
thank
you.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
may
it
please
the
court.
appellant's
request
here
relief
which
was
not
requested
in
the
district
court
below,
this
is
the
first
time
a
request
has
been
made
for
an
order
directing
a
state
official
to
put
the
names
of
the
socialist
labor
party
candidates
on
the
ballot.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
that's
correct
your
honor.
it
was
not
part
of
the
prayer
of
the
complaint
and
the
complaint
has
not
been
amended.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
no,
your
honor,
the
court
below
treated
the
cases,
the
williams'
case
and
this
case
together
for
decision
but
the
cases
have
maintained
a
separate
identity.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
i
think
your
honor,
yes
your
honor.
i
do
not
believe
the
court
did
treat
it
that
way
and
it
is
clear
that
they
did
not
seek
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
yes,
if
i
may
clarify
your
honor
the
--
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
--
the
prayer
requested
the
legislature
to
act
and
if
the
court
did
not
act
and
if
the
legislation
does
not
act,
they
asked
the
court
to
declare
that
section
3517.01
of
the
revised
code
which
requires
which
contains
the
15%
requirement
be
held
invalid.
but
there
was
no
request
for
the
specific
injunction
relief
of
having
names
physically
put
on
ballots
and
machines
which
is
initially
asked
for
in
this
court.
the
--
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
as
a
practical
matter,
it
is
impossible
at
this
time
to
--
for
the
state
of
ohio
to
comply
with
an
order
granting
the
requested
relief.
mr.
gordon
has
apparently
canvassed
10
boards
of
elections.he
mentions
cuyahoga
county,
he
does
not
mention
that
he
checked
franklin
county
or
he
was
advised
that
it
was
an
impossibility.
i
have
asked
the
secretary
of
state
before
filing
this
motion
if
it
would
be
possible.
he
has
advised
me
that
it
would
be
impossible.
nothing
this
court
can
do
short
of
setting
back
the
election
date
can
result
in
them
appellants
getting
the
relief
they
request.
further,
we
feel
that
the
arguments
presented
by
this
appeal
are
the
same
as
the
arguments
and
questions
presented
by
the
appeal
in
williams
versus
rhodes
and
therefore
since
four
argument
has
been
made,
we
do
not
wish
to
make
any
further
argument
at
this
time.
we
would
respectfully
request
this
court
to
affirm
the
decision
of
the
united
states
district
court.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
certainly,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
yes,
your
honor.
section
3517.01
provides
that
a
party
will
continue
on
the
ballot
as
long
as
it
gets
10%
of
the
popular
vote
for
governor
or
in
the
alternative
the
15%
requirement
of
signatures
on
the
petition.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
we're
--
i
--
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
the
state
is
asking
only
that
this
court
affirm
the
order
of
the
district
court.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
yes,
your
honor.
we
would
ask
the
court
to
refuse
the
requested
further
relief
and
affirm
the
order
which
denied
relief.
we
would
request
this
court
to
affirm
the
denial
of
relief
by
the
district
court.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
that's
correct
your
honor
and
the
state
has
not
appealed
that
order.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
yes
your
honor
that's
correct
we
feel
that
there
is
no
constitutional
requirement
of
right
in
voting
for
presidential
electors.
but
we
did
not
appeal
that
--
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
3705.01
which
i
believe
is
appended
to
our
motion
in
the
williams
case.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
3517.01,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
that
is
a
definition
section
in
which
a
definition
of
a
political
party
is
set
out.
it
requires
first
that
a
political
party
is
one
which
obtain
10%
of
the
total
vote
for
its
candidate
for
governor
in
the
last
election
or
one
which
presents
to
the
secretary
of
state
a
qualifying
positions
signed
by
a
15%
of
those
who
voted
in
the
last
gubernatorial
election.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
no
your
honor,
that
is
this
section.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
yes,
your
honor
that
is
all
part
of
the
same
section.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
yes,
your
honor.
thank
you.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
mr.
chief
justice,
mr.
justices
of
the
court,
may
it
please
the
court.
at
counsel
table
with
me
is
alan
schwartz,
a
member
of
the
bar
of
the
state
of
new
york.
first,
i
would
like
to
clear
up
a
typographical
error
that
appears
in
our
brief
on
page
19.
the
error
was
discovered
too
late
to
change.
it
was
discovered
while
the
messenger
was
delivering
these
briefs
to
the
court
and
he
misunderstood
the
direction.
on
page
19,
it
should
be
november
1967,
the
1968
should
be
crossed
out
and
november
should
be
left
instead
of
1968
being
crossed
out.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
yes,
and
this
is
required
by
the
district
court's
opinion
at
page
16.
although,
appellant
does
not
make
the
argument
today
here
in
oral
argument
that
the
appellee
must
cross
appeal
if
he
would
question
the
basis
on
which
the
lower
court
decided
a
case.
some
suggestion
was
contained
in
his
reply
brief
to
that
principle.
we
would
only
cite
the
court
to
these
cases
letulle
versus
scofield
308
united
states
415,
lucas
versus
alexander
279
united
states
573,
and
the
langnes
versus
green
282
u.s.
531.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
letulle
versus
scofield
308
u.s.
415.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
the
proposition
that
an
appellee
may
argue
any
--
may
use
any
argument
to
support
in
order
of
a
trial
court
even
if
that
order
is
--
even
if
the
argument
is
inconsistent
with
the
basis
for
the
order.
the
ohio
election
laws
require
that
a
candidate
for
president
must
be
nominated
by
a
national
political
convention
to
which
delegates
have
been
selected
in
an
ohio
primary.
in
ohio,
in
order
to
qualify
as
a
primary
--
as
a
new
political
party,
the
group
seeking
to
qualify
must
present
signatures
of
15%
of
the
total
vote
of
those
voting
in
the
last
gubernatorial
election.
these
requirements
reasonably
protect
a
valid
state
interest.
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
at
any
given
time
there's
a
substantial
number
of
disaffected
people,
disaffected
with
the
candidates
or
the
programs
of
the
two
major
parties.
this
group
is
obviously
issue
oriented
and
by
signing
an
independent
nominating
petition,
they
are
at
most
expressing
some
adherence
to
a
principle.
in
the
interest
of
preventing
any
would
be
candidate
or
leader
from
coming
in
and
grabbing
this
group
without
a
contest.
the
ohio
law
requires
that
the
candidate
submit
himself
to
a
primary
election.
this
gives
the
disaffected,
this
more
or
less
cohesive
group
the
right
to
choose
its
candidate
just
as
the
primary
laws
give
the
members
of
the
republican
and
democrat
parties
the
right
to
choose
their
leader.
the
15%
required
dovetails
with
this
primary
requirement
by
preventing
a
would
be
leader
from
coming
in
circulating
qualifying
petitions
obtaining
only
a
few
numbers
and
thus
limiting
those
who
would
vote
in
the
primary
to
those
signing.
of
course,
he
would
select
the
people
who
would
be
expected
to
support
his
candidacy.
another
would
be
leader
with
parallel
political
philosophy
might
be
deterred
by
the
initial
filing
from
filing
another
qualifying
petition.
this
would
--
the
requirement
that
a
primary
be
held
supports
the
logical
state
interest
in
preventing
a
disaffected
group
from
splintering
itself.
it
prevents
--
it
aids
the
disaffected
in
reasonable
go
of
remaining
to
some
extent
cohesive.
so,
they
might
be
affected
and
in
addition,
the
state
has
an
interest
in
knowing
the
extent
of
the
disaffection
so
that
it
may
accommodate
this
disaffection
within
the
system
if
that
is
possible.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
because
the
splintering
distorts
your
honor
the
effect
and
weight
of
the
disaffected
group
by
--
is
the
state
interest
is
in
political
parties
or
the
voters?
the
state
is
interested
at
both
political
parties
and
voters
but
also
it's
in
--
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
i'm
sorry,
i
did
not
mean
splinter
from
a
party,
it
splinter
from
the
initial
candidate
that
has
filed
to
accommodate
himself
to
the
disaffection.
the
state
has
an
interest
in
maintaining
the
disaffection
in
such
a
form
that
it's
not
distorted,
it's
not
splintered
but
this
is
not
the
party,
it's
the
disaffected
group.
so
the
state
may
know
the
extent
of
the
disaffection.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
disaffected
from
the
two
major
qualified
parties
or
any
number
of
qualified
parties.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
that's
true
your
honor
and
we
--
in
the
state
of
ohio
would
seek
to
preserve
the
right
of
these
people
to
select
their
candidate.
but
we
also
want
to
prevent
any
would
be
candidate
from
coming
in
and
grabbing
the
support
of
the
whole
group
just
because
he's
first.
that
is
the
interest
that
the
state
seeks
to
preserve
through
the
primary
requirement
in
the
15%
requirement.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
it
would
certainly
provide
an
interruption
but
more
significantly
it
would
--
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
yes,
your
honor.
pursuant
to
mr.
justice
stewart's
temporary
order,
the
state
has
put
itself
in
a
position
that
it
can
comply
with
an
order
of
this
court.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
that's
correct.
in
this
case,
it
is
not.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
yes,
your
honor
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
certainly.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
oh!
clearly
your
honor
as
quickly
as
this
court
can
decide
but
i
would
say
that
if
--
that
if
a
decision
is
made
by
the
15th
of
october,
it
is
my
understanding
that
the
state
can
comply
with
the
order
whatever
it
is.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
yes,
your
honor
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
the
three-judge
court
found
that
probably
as
early
as
1964
and
certainly
by
november
1967
the
appellants
had
been
fully
briefed
by
the
secretary
of
state
and
as
to
the
requirements
for
ballot
position
in
ohio.
consequently,
that
the
appellants
had
adequate
time
after
november
1967
to
file
a
declaratory
judgment
action
questioning
the
ohio
statutes
which
they
feel
are
invalid.
and
if
that
had
been
done
and
if
these
statutes
have
been
determined
to
be
invalid
there
would
have
been
time
for
the
ohio
general
assembly
to
reconsider
the
laws
and
amend
them
to
comply
with
any
order
which
would
hold
--
which
would've
held
these
laws
invalid.
it
would've
preserve
the
requirement
of
a
primary
by
one
man
or
another
or
in
the
alternative
the
court
could've
adopted
a
procedure
for
this
one
election
which
would've
satisfied
all
the
objections
that
they
might
have
found
in
the
ohio
election
procedure.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
no,
your
honor
there
hasn't.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
no,
your
honor,
the
state
of
ohio
does
not
maintain
that
it
is
impossible.
we
firmly
believe
that
it
is
possible
to
comply
with
the
requirements
but
nevertheless
pursuant
to
the
authority
of
article
ii,
section
1,
clause
2,
the
state
of
ohio
is
given
plenary
power
to
establish
--
to
appoint
presidential
electors
in
any
manner
it
may
direct.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
we
have
trouble
with
the
order
of
--
the
decision
and
order
of
the
lower
court
and
i
do
not
believe
that
order
is
clear
what
findings
they
did
in
fact
to
me.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
we
don't
believe
so
but
again
there
is
some
ambiguity.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
the
question
of
the
extent
of
the
power
of
article
ii
is
--
has
not
been
decided
because
of
the
dearth
of
cases
considering
this.
however,
it
is
not
our
position
that
the
exercise
of
article
ii
power
was
--
is
without
any
limitation
at
all.
we
recognize
that
the
state
must
comply
with
constitutional
commands
specific
constitutional
commands
but
the
thing
that
we
argue
--
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
the
constitutional
--
the
commands
of
the
first
amendment
as
it
is
--
as
it
applies
to
the
state
pursuant
to
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
we
--
the
state
of
ohio
--
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
equal
protection
after
--
well,
first,
the
state
is
not
--
the
state
legislature
is
not
required
to
have
an
election
and
that
is
clear
after
mcpherson
versus
blacker
and
this
was
affirmed
as
recently
as
1951
in
ray
versus
blair
in
this
court.
but
if
the
court
--
if
the
state
legislature
is
not
required
to
have
an
election
at
all
when
it
does
have
an
election
--
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
when
the
argument
broke
for
the
luncheon
recess,
i
was
considering
the
application
of
the
equal
protection
clause
to
the
article
ii
powers
vested
in
state
legislatures.
we
agree
that
the
equal
protection
clause
may
very
well
apply
some
limitation
to
the
power
of
the
state
legislatures
to
direct
the
appointment,
the
manner
of
the
appointment
of
presidential
electors.
we
believe
that
that
power
may
be
limited
in
such
a
respect
that
the
state
legislatures
could
not
disqualify
anyone
from
being
an
elector
on
the
basis
of
race.
however,
no
claim
has
been
made
that
the
ohio
procedures
violate
these
kinds
of
equal
protection
guarantees.
we
do
deny
however
that
there
is
any
limitation
on
the
legislature's
power
based
on
the
principle
that
electors
should
be
chosen
on
the
basis
of
popular
support
of
candidates.
this
--
the
mcpherson
case
recognized
and
appellants
can
see
that
the
legislature
has
the
right
to
appoint
electors.
when
the
legislature
does
appoint
directly,
it
cannot
appoint
on
the
basis
of
popular
support
for
the
simple
reason
it
doesn't
know
the
popular
support,
no
election
having
been
had.
the
argument
is
could
be
made
however
that
once
an
election
is
held
that
some
other
kind
of
equal
protection
limitation
suddenly
appears.
equal
protection
is
not
particularly
applicable
to
elections.
it
applies
equally
to
the
legislature
when
it
appoints
directly
or
when
it
holds
an
election.
there's
no
reason
in
--
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
not
on
the
equal
protection,
your
honor.
both
must
fail
on
the
equal
protection
because
equal
protection
is
not
applicable.
however,
in
a
situation
where
there
is
no
right
to
have
a
vote
but
a
vote
is
nevertheless
had
for
example,
the
situation
in
georgia
where
the
--
this
court
in
fortson
held
that
there
is
no
constitutional
right
for
the
governor
of
a
state
to
be
elected
by
popular
election.
nevertheless,
gray
would
suggest
that
there
is
some
kind
of
limitation
based
on
equal
protection
that
applies
to
this
situation.
however,
this
other
kind
of
equal
protection
is
not
representative
government
for
if
it
were,
how
can
this
court
explain
fortson
when
although
the
election
was
not
required
to
be
held.
when
it
was
held,
this
court
allowed
the
legislature
to
disregard
the
result
of
that
vote
and
select
the
candidate
receiving
the
least
popular
votes.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
no
your
honor,
i'm
not
saying
that
i'm
saying
that
there
are,
there
may
be
some
requirements
--
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
they
are
required
to
honor
some
of
the
guarantees
contained
an
equal
protection
race,
religion,
belief
but
they
are
not
required
to
hold
the
election
on
an
equal
protection
basis
of
representative
government
or
any
theory
that
the
electors
chose
unless
be
the
result
of
popular
support
of
the
candidate
because
in
the
fortson
versus
morris
case
it's
impossible
to
reach
that
result.
the
election
was
held,
the
--
this
court
allowed
the
legislature
of
georgia
to
select
the
candidate
not
receiving
the
most
popular
votes.
representative
government
in
this
situation
such
in
dissimilar,
analogous
situation
of
the
right
of
the
legislature
to
select
presidential
electors
and
the
additional
provision
that
they
need
not
have
an
election
requires
that
if
an
election
is
held
it
has
to
meet
certain
constitutional
equal
protection
safeguards.
we
cannot
discriminate
against
the
voter.
we
can
only
discriminate
against
the
right
of
the
voter
to
have
his
candidate,
have
a
chance
to
win
which
is
exactly
what
happened
in
the
fortson
versus
morris
case
in
this
court.
going
back
to
the
reasonableness
of
the
laws
of
ohio
we
would
suggest
an
additional
reason
for
the
requirement
that
a
primary
be
held
and
the
requirement
of
15%
support
and
that
is
the
experience
in
ohio
in
the
years
1944
and
1948
and
the
presidential
electors
--
elections
in
those
years.
the
elections
were
very
close
in
both
years.
a
third
party
by
taking
support
away
from
one
of
the
two
major
parties
who
had
a
chance
to
win
the
election
could
distort
the
result
of
the
election
in
ohio
by
giving
the
entire
electoral
votes
of
ohio
to
the
least
popular
candidate.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
there's
no
question
it
can
your
honor
and
we
believe
that
any
state
can
provide
against
that.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
the
state
legislature
pursuant
to
article
ii
has
not
limited
that
but
has
provided
that
in
order
to
participate,
there
must
be
a
showing
of
the
possibility
of
substantial
political
effectiveness,
that's
the
15%
requirement.
it's
a
balancing
by
the
state
of
the
competing
interest,
one,
the
interest
in
not
distorting
the
popular
vote
of
those
who
may
win
and
giving
some
voice
to
the
party
that
may
be
effective
though
it
can't
win.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
that
is
a
legislature
--
legislative
problem
your
honor
and
of
course
i
would
defend
it
if
the
legislature
passed
it
but
that
is
certainly
not
a
judicial
question
that
can
be
answered.
there
are
no
constitutional
standards.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
because
--
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
because
your
honor
the
court
--
the
legislature
is
not
required
to
have
an
election
at
all
and
when
it
does
--
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
it
would
still
be
our
position
that
article
ii,
section
1,
clause
2
authorizes
the
legislature
to
have
that
kind
of
requirement.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
some
parts
of
the
equal
protection
clause
apply.
we
could
not
disenfranchise
voters
from
voting
in
the
election.
this
would
be
gray
versus
sanders.
we
have
to
give
the
wallace
people
or
any
other
people
the
right
to
vote
in
the
election
if
we're
having
it.
all
we
can
do
is
control
the
candidates
who
are
going
to
be
submitted
for
the
reason
that
we
have
the
absolute
right
to
make
this
election
ourselves
in
the
legislature.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
for
the
purpose
of
selecting
presidential
electors?
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
yes,
your
honor,
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
yes.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
no,
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
no
your
honor,
i
do
not
believe
there
is
a
distinction
based
on
the
power
of
article
ii
and
the
plenary
power
that
the
legislatures
have
whether
or
not
it's
an
individual
candidate
or
a
party
(voice
overlap).
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
no
your
honor,
we
believe
that
the
state
of
ohio
was
acting
reasonably
with
respect
to
the
candidate
too
for
the
reason
that
the
state
has
a
legitimate
interest
in
protecting
against
the
distortion
of
the
popular
vote
against
the
two
candidates
having
a
chance
to
win.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
a
presidential
candidate,
your
honor?
no,
there
is
no
way
that
a
presidential
candidate
nor
his
electors
can
participate
in
the
presidential
election
in
ohio
except
through
a
party
primary
and
a
party
ballot.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
i
think
of
that
question
we're
better
be
left
to
cancel
--
counsel
for
appellant
because
i
don't
know
what
they're
doing.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
let
me
say
that
if
the
ohio
ballots
are
required
to
be
reprinted
with
the
different
name
for
vice
president,
we
are
now
too
late
to
accomplish
the
result.
it
is
too
late;
we
are
too
far
down
the
road
to
change
the
ballot
to
that
extent.
the
ballots
have
been
printed
and
put
in
a
preparatory
form
to
comply
with
any
possible
order
of
this
court
pursuant
to
your
order
but
we
can't
come
up
with
a
new
name.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
it's
pursuant
to
mr.
justice
stewart's
order.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
so
far
as
we
know.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
well,
that
that
is
another
question
your
honor.
we
feel
that
probably
the
presidential
electors
once
they
are
chosen
are
not
bound
by
names
appearing
on
the
ballot
but
we
admit
we
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
question.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
we
don't
know
the
answer.
this
court
has
not
decided
it,
we
don't
know.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
only
as
of
the
time
they're
nominated
by
convention
which
is
another
thing
--
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
an
elector
may
be
free,
yes.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
no,
we
--
well,
there
might
be
--
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
yes,
that's
correct
your
honor.
although,
it
may
be
a
provision
of
state
law
i
guess
we
feel
that
there
is
a
serious
question
about
its
enforceability.
we
base
--
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
the
conflict
of
possible
conflict
between
the
rights,
duties
and
authorities
of
electors
under
the
federal
constitution
and
the
rights
of
--
and
the
requirements
of
law
binding
them.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
i've
been
advised
by
my
co-counsel
that
there
is
a
requirement
by
such
a
requirement
ohio
law.
it
was
one
with
which
i
was
not
familiar.
we've
based
much
of
our
case
on
the
authority
of
article
ii
but
even
if
it
does,
it
didn't
exist
appellants
could
not
prevail
on
this
appeal.
although,
one
man,
one
vote
is
an
applicable
standard
for
judging
legislative
apportionment
cases.
it
does
not
answer
the
questions
raised
by
the
interrelationship
and
the
interaction
of
third
party
candidates
in
presidential
politics.
history
shows
us
that
third
party
candidates
do
not
win
presidential
elections
in
ohio.
therefore,
--
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
history
shows
us
that
third
party
candidates
do
not
win
the
presidential
electors
in
this
country.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
the
question
i
would
suggest
your
honor
is,
is
this
court
prepared
to
make
the
judgment
that
they
can
or
they
cannot?
again,
this
is
a
problem
that
this
court
faces.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
the
question
isn't
the
right
of
the
citizen
to
vote
--
the
right
of
the
legislature
to
place
qualifications
in
the
in
the
path
of
one
seeking
to
be
in
the
ballot.
the
--
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
yes,
they
do.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
yes
your
honor,
they
do
pursuant
to
article
ii.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
yes,
insofar
as
they
could
not
have
election,
they
can
limit
it
--
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
well,
that
case
is
not
before
this
court.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
but
the
state
certainly
doesn't
do
that
and
there
may
very
well
be
some
first
amendment
guarantee
which
would
apply,
which
would
prevent
the
state
from
doing
that.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
they
can't,
that's
our
position.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
the
effect
on
the
electoral
process
of
third
parties
lies
in
the
territory
of
a
cohesive
minority
can
exert
over
major
parties.
does
the
standard
of
representative
government
require
that
a
tyrannical
minority
can
sway
and
affect
the
positions
taken
by
major
parties,
and
is
this
good
or
bad?
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
this
--
no,
i
didn't
use
the
word
“radical”
but
--
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
tyrannical.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
the
question
the
court
faces
is
whether
it's
restricted
at
all.
the
court
must
answer
whether
there's
any
standard
by
which
it
can
--
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
we're
trying
--
i
think
the
state
is
reasonably
trying
to
stop
the
exercise
of
a
tyranny
by
minority
parties
on
major
parties
for
example,
in
israel
--
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
yes.
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
that's
correct
your
honor
and
a
good
example
--
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
the
good
example
--
a
good
example
is
the
situation
that
we
know
exists
in
israel
a
very
small
--
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
yes,
your
honor.
and
if
it
can
exist
in
israel
today
it
could've
existed
in
ohio
in
the
early
1950's,
a
small
religious
party
in
israel
requires
the
two
major
parties
to
conform
with
its
religious
philosophy
--
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
it
would
be
the
same
if
this
kind
of
thing
happened
in
the
state
of
ohio
and
what
i'm
suggesting
is
this
court
does
not
have
a
standard
to
answer
the
question
whether
this
is
good
or
bad.
and
certainly,
the
standard
of
representative
government
does
not
answer
this
question.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
representative
government
does
not,
cannot
answer
this
question
whether
a
tyranny
--
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
not
for
presidential
electors,
your
honor.
the
article
ii
power
would
exclude
the
right
to
make
this
restriction.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
well,
the
answer
--
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
yes,
that's
true
but
the
answer
to
this
kind
of
unfairness
in
the
legislature
is
electing
a
new
legislature
and
when
the
legislature
is
elected
by
one
man,
one
vote
we
can
be
reasonably
sure
that
this
kind
of
thing
will
not
happen.
finally,
where
do
we
get
the
idea
the
representative
government
applies
to
presidential
politics
when
the
whole
process
is
not
representative.
the
electors
are
selected
in
the
states
as
a
unit.
the
popular
vote
frequently
differs
from
the
electoral
vote
and
certainly
there's
no
mathematical
coalition.
again,
one
man,
one
vote
does
not
apply.
there
is
a
further
distortion
by
the
provision
that
each
state
gets
two
electoral
votes
for
each
senator,
thereby,
increasing
the
representation
of
the
smallest
state
over
the
larger
states.
if
there
is
no
majority
in
the
electoral
college
and
the
election
goes
to
the
house
of
representative
the
winners
are
decided
on
the
basis
of
each
state
having
one
vote
and
this
is
certainly
over
states
or
over
emphasizes
the
political
representation
of
the
smallest
states.
and
finally,
they
--
the
electoral
college
may
choose
or
the
house
of
representatives
may
choose
among
the
three
highest
candidates.
it
is
not
limited
to
the
highest.
so,
the
value
of
one
man,
one
vote
doesn't
apply.
since
it
is
not
a
part
of
the
system,
since
the
electoral
collegiate
principle
does
not
include
representative
government
why
must
we
say
that
any
one
part
of
it
must.
for
these
reasons,
one
that
the
ohio
--
that
the
ohio
general
assembly
has
given
broad
clarity
power
pursuant
to
article
ii
for
the
question
that
this
court
really
doesn't
have
standards
to
answer
the
questions
involved
in
the
interrelationship
between
third
parties
and
presidential
politics.
for
the
reason
that
the
ohio
laws
are
reasonable
and
are
reasonably
designed
to
accomplish
a
valid
objective.
and
finally,
that
the
cases
in
this
court
show
definitely
that
although
when
an
election
is
not
required
to
be
held,
if
it
is
held
it
must
have
some
fairness
but
that
does
not
include
the
right
to
maximize
or
equalize
the
chance
of
the
voters
candidate
winning
and
i
again
emphasize
fortson
versus
morris
for
these
reasons,
this
court
should
affirm
the
order
of
the
united
states
district
court.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
yes,
your
honor.
first,
if
--
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
--
if
this
petitioners
had
questions
about
ohio
election
laws,
these
other
laws
that
have
been
referred
to.
first,
let
me
say
that
they
do
not
relate
to
third
parties.
the
district
court
did
not
find
they're
related
to
third
parties.
the
ohio
supreme
court
in
beck
versus
hummel
says
that
the
ohio
election
laws
will
be
liberality
construed
and
that
this
court
should
probably
not
consider
initially
the
constitutionality
of
the
election
laws
not
considered
by
the
court
below.
if
they
had
questions
about
these
laws,
they
should've
filed
the
declaratory
judgment
action
sometime
prior
to
february
of
1968.
further,
if
they
were
clear
about
what
the
laws
required
they
should've
gone
out
and
gotten
signatures
on
their
petitions
prior
to
the
filing
date
which
was
sometime
in
february
1967
to
qualify
their
party
as
a
political
party
in
ohio.
at
the
same
time,
they
could've
encouraged
people
who
were
signing
these
petitions
to
run
for
county
committees
and
state
committees.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
that's
correct
your
honor.
but
i
was
just
outlining
the
procedure
that
they
should've
followed
if
they
had
done
everything
that
need
be
done.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
if
the
requirement
that
a
party
in
ohio
must
have
a
primary,
a
party
primary
to
get
on
the
ballot
then
clearly
they
would've
had
to
file
the
petitions
sometime
in
february
1968
because
it
would
be
impossible
for
a
party
--
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
well,
that
certainly
unreasonably
delayed
and
then
necessary
delayed
their
action.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
well,
insofar
as
the
district
court
did
not
consider
these
questions
did
not
decide
they
were
unconstitutional.
it's
not
for
this
court
but
as
a
representative
of
the
attorney
general
of
ohio.
i'm
telling
you
that
these
requirements
other
requirements
of
law
fairly
read
do
not
deny
ballot
position
to
third
parties
or
make
it
impossible
for
third
parties
to
qualify.
and
therefore,
if
it's
not
impossible
it's
not
--
they
could
have
done
it
and
they
could've
done
it
last
spring.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
there
has
been
no
question
of
that
provision
your
honor
and
i
would
suggest
that
yes
it
is
reasonable,
certainly
it's
reasonable.
thank
you.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
that's
correct
your
honor.
but
that
again
is
one
of
the
things
that
is
required
to
get
on
the
ballot
in
ohio,
one
of
the
requirements
that
the
ohio
general
assembly
has
provided
pursuant
to
the
ground
authority
in
article
ii,
section
1,
clause
2.
thank
you.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
may
it
please
the
court.
appellant's
request
here
relief
which
was
not
requested
in
the
district
court
below,
this
is
the
first
time
a
request
has
been
made
for
an
order
directing
a
state
official
to
put
the
names
of
the
socialist
labor
party
candidates
on
the
ballot.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
that's
correct
your
honor.
it
was
not
part
of
the
prayer
of
the
complaint
and
the
complaint
has
not
been
amended.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
no,
your
honor,
the
court
below
treated
the
cases,
the
williams'
case
and
this
case
together
for
decision
but
the
cases
have
maintained
a
separate
identity.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
i
think
your
honor,
yes
your
honor.
i
do
not
believe
the
court
did
treat
it
that
way
and
it
is
clear
that
they
did
not
seek
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
yes,
if
i
may
clarify
your
honor
the
--
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
--
the
prayer
requested
the
legislature
to
act
and
if
the
court
did
not
act
and
if
the
legislation
does
not
act,
they
asked
the
court
to
declare
that
section
3517.01
of
the
revised
code
which
requires
which
contains
the
15%
requirement
be
held
invalid.
but
there
was
no
request
for
the
specific
injunction
relief
of
having
names
physically
put
on
ballots
and
machines
which
is
initially
asked
for
in
this
court.
the
--
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
as
a
practical
matter,
it
is
impossible
at
this
time
to
--
for
the
state
of
ohio
to
comply
with
an
order
granting
the
requested
relief.
mr.
gordon
has
apparently
canvassed
10
boards
of
elections.he
mentions
cuyahoga
county,
he
does
not
mention
that
he
checked
franklin
county
or
he
was
advised
that
it
was
an
impossibility.
i
have
asked
the
secretary
of
state
before
filing
this
motion
if
it
would
be
possible.
he
has
advised
me
that
it
would
be
impossible.
nothing
this
court
can
do
short
of
setting
back
the
election
date
can
result
in
them
appellants
getting
the
relief
they
request.
further,
we
feel
that
the
arguments
presented
by
this
appeal
are
the
same
as
the
arguments
and
questions
presented
by
the
appeal
in
williams
versus
rhodes
and
therefore
since
four
argument
has
been
made,
we
do
not
wish
to
make
any
further
argument
at
this
time.
we
would
respectfully
request
this
court
to
affirm
the
decision
of
the
united
states
district
court.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
certainly,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
yes,
your
honor.
section
3517.01
provides
that
a
party
will
continue
on
the
ballot
as
long
as
it
gets
10%
of
the
popular
vote
for
governor
or
in
the
alternative
the
15%
requirement
of
signatures
on
the
petition.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
we're
--
i
--
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
the
state
is
asking
only
that
this
court
affirm
the
order
of
the
district
court.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
yes,
your
honor.
we
would
ask
the
court
to
refuse
the
requested
further
relief
and
affirm
the
order
which
denied
relief.
we
would
request
this
court
to
affirm
the
denial
of
relief
by
the
district
court.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
that's
correct
your
honor
and
the
state
has
not
appealed
that
order.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
yes
your
honor
that's
correct
we
feel
that
there
is
no
constitutional
requirement
of
right
in
voting
for
presidential
electors.
but
we
did
not
appeal
that
--
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
3705.01
which
i
believe
is
appended
to
our
motion
in
the
williams
case.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
3517.01,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
that
is
a
definition
section
in
which
a
definition
of
a
political
party
is
set
out.
it
requires
first
that
a
political
party
is
one
which
obtain
10%
of
the
total
vote
for
its
candidate
for
governor
in
the
last
election
or
one
which
presents
to
the
secretary
of
state
a
qualifying
positions
signed
by
a
15%
of
those
who
voted
in
the
last
gubernatorial
election.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
no
your
honor,
that
is
this
section.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
yes,
your
honor
that
is
all
part
of
the
same
section.
mr.
charles
s.
lopeman
yes,
your
honor.
thank
you.
