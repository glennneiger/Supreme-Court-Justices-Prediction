mr.
jerry
gordon
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
jerry
gordon
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court,
this
is
the
companion
action
in
the
case
below
the
appellants
were
plaintiffs
in
the
district
court
in
the
southern
district
of
ohio,
they
are
the
socialist
labor
party
of
america
and
its
ohio
members.
they
brought
suit
to
challenge
an
ohio
electoral
system
which
completely
excluded
them
from
participating
on
an
equal
basis
with
the
other
political
parties
in
ohio
or
even
an
unequal
basis.
their
rights
as
a
political
party
were
in
effect
obliterated
by
a
series
of
ohio
election
laws.
they
challenged
those
laws,
a
declaratory
judgment
favorable
to
their
position
was
rendered,
right
in
voting
was
provided
for
the
november
1968
general
election,
ballot
position
was
denied.
from
that
branch
of
the
opinion
denying
ballot
position,
we
appeal.
socialist
labor
party
of
america
is
a
national
political
party
with
roots
reaching
back
into
the
19th
century.
it
advocates
the
socialist
reconstruction
american
society
and
it
advocates
that
this
be
brought
about
to
the
ballot.
it
has
never
used
any
other
means
but
peaceful
constitutional
means
to
advance
it
to
position.
accordingly,
it
places
great
emphasize
on
elections.
it
is
currently
in
its
20th
consecutive
presidential
campaign.
in
1964
presidential
elections,
it
was
on
the
ballot
in
16
states
conducted
a
write-in
campaign
in
nine
others.
similarly,
it
has
been
on
the
ballot
in
ohio
going
back
into
the
19th
century.
now,
the
party
in
ohio
has
modest
numbers
pursuant
to
the
request
of
the
district
court
documents
were
submitted
which
show
to
the
parties
members
equal
in
some
approximately
108.
these
documents
also
show
that
the
party
distributed
in
single
year
and
this
is
customary
approximately
a
quarter
of
million
of
a
pieces
of
literature
leaflets.
it
is
a
small
party
but
an
energetic
one.
mr.
jerry
gordon
we
take
issue
with
that
position,
your
honor.
we
did
apply
for
equivalent
relief
--
mr.
jerry
gordon
that's
correct.
mr.
jerry
gordon
that's
right.
mr.
jerry
gordon
we
have
that
problem
but
it's
out
position
that
there
is
more
than
ample
opportunity
to
print
ballots
or
if
it's
necessary
to
reprint
ballots
which
in
our
judgment
will
conform
to
the
imperatives
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
its
equal
protection
clause.
mr.
jerry
gordon
well,
for
one
thing
and
counsel
on
both
sides
have
to
rely
in
representations
to
the
court
that
is
what
we
do.
we've
been
in
touch
with
some
10
counties.
now,
in
four
of
these
counties,
ballots
have
been
printed,
completely
printed.
and
another
four
counties,
ballots
are
in
process
of
being
printed.
now,
cuyahoga
county
and
in
mahoning
county,
ballots
are
going
to
be
printed
next
week.
there
are
still
opportunity
and
if
it's
possible
in
a
county
the
size
of
cuyahoga
county
which
is
the
most
largely
populated,
densely
populated
county
in
ohio
they
still
print
ballots
for
the
general
election,
then
we
submit
that
it
is
possible
in
every
other
county.
we
are
after
all
some
29
days
before
the
election.
we
have
many,
many
printers.
it's
still
possible
to
print
ballots
in
time
for
that
election.
the
mcdougal
versus
green
are
only
12
days
before
the
election
(voice
overlap).
mr.
jerry
gordon
we
would
concede
that
there
will
be
a
great
practical
problem
as
far
as
programming
machines.
we
are
not
able
to
represent
--
mr.
jerry
gordon
well,
your
honor
it
varies
widely
in
franklin
county
all
the
--
mr.
jerry
gordon
well,
we
have
88
different
systems.
we
don't
have
those
statistics.
mr.
jerry
gordon
well,
i'm
unable
to
say
--
mr.
jerry
gordon
well,
in
cuyahoga
county
it's
much
less
than,
in
franklin
county
it's
all.
so,
may
mean
that
if
we
secure
the
order
that
we
seek
and
we'd
like
to
argue
why
we
feel
the
order
should
be
rendered
despite
the
practical
difficulties
that
counties
have
planned
to
conduct
their
elections
via
voting
machines
may
have
to
use
paper
ballots.
this
may
be
the
case
but
at
any
rate
t
is
certainly
possible
at
this
juncture
to
print
paper
ballots,
there's
plenty
of
time
for
the
entire
state.
and
for
cuyahoga
county,
their
voting
machines
have
already
been
programmed
to
provide
for
the
socialist
labor
party
candidates
any
event
this
court
does
order
those
candidates
be
placed
in
the
ballot.
mr.
jerry
gordon
when
were
the
candidates
selected?
mr.
jerry
gordon
the
candidates
were
selected
by
the
socialist
labor
party
its
national
candidates
at
it's
convention
in
may
of
this
year.
mr.
jerry
gordon
well,
no
your
honor
although
i
don't
think
that
rule
by
itself
precludes
--
i
was
getting
on
the
ballots
because
the
other
parties
didn't
nominate
their
candidates
until
august.
mr.
jerry
gordon
who
was
the
candidate
of
the
socialist
labor
party
for
president
four
years
ago?
mr.
jerry
gordon
i'm
not
--
mr.
jerry
gordon
well,
let
me
go
to
the
next
question
because
i'm
not
sure
who
the
candidates
of
the
party
were.
i
know
that
they
are
this
time,
they
are
blowman
and
taylor.
the
reasons
that
the
socialist
labor
party
did
not
bring
its
suit
earlier,
now,
the
documents
submitted
to
the
court
this
question
is
covered
in
reports
to
the
state
conventions.
party
was
anxious
to
test
the
constitutional
of
these
laws
some
years
passed.
it
simply
didn't
have
the
resources,
in
1946,
it
qualified
for
the
ballot
in
ohio
had
to
file
30,000
signatures
to
qualify
its
candidate
for
governor,
it
filed
45,000.
and
what
happened?
the
board
of
election
said,
not
enough
signatures
had
been
filed.
the
party
had
to
file
mandamus
action
in
ohio
supreme
court
and
finally
got
an
order
and
put
their
candidate
on
the
ballot
but
that
exhausted
the
party's
resources.
it's
a
small
party
and
it's
not
affluent
party
and
it
--
for
over
a
period
of
years
it
attempted
to
get
counsel
which
could
pursue
this
action
and
was
unable
to
finance
it.
and
this
case
it
has
been
brought
by
the
civil
liberties
union,
that's
the
only
way
the
party
has
been
able
to
advance
its
position
and
challenge
these
laws.
now,
--
mr.
jerry
gordon
it
has
--
the
party
shows
a
membership
of
108
in
ohio
as
of
1966.
mr.
jerry
gordon
i'm
sorry
i
didn't
understand.
mr.
jerry
gordon
more
candidates?
mr.
jerry
gordon
counties?
mr.
jerry
gordon
i
suppose
there
are
but
there's
many
states
where
a
party
of
108
it
has
no
difficulty
whatever
in
getting
on
the
ballot.
in
the
state
of
washington
100
people
can
come
together.
mr.
jerry
gordon
that's
correct
your
honor.
we
say
this
that
a
small
political
party
has
an
absolute
constitutional
right
to
be
on
the
ballot
unless
a
state
can
prove
and
can
show
a
compelling
necessity
which
would
justify
legislation
which
has
the
effect
of
excluding
that
party
from
the
ballot.
the
rights
of
the
members
of
the
small
party
to
be
on
the
ballot
are
just
as
important
to
them
perhaps
more
so
than
the
rights
of
the
members
of
a
large
political
party.
one
is
just
as
important
as
the
other.
mr.
jerry
gordon
well,
no
your
honor.
we
added
a
branch
to
that.
we
said
subject
to
--
if
a
state
can
prove
a
compelling
justification
to
--
mr.
jerry
gordon
it's
hard
for
me
to,
your
honor,
because
we've
examined
the
reasons
that
have
historically
been
offered
and
we
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
jerry
gordon
the
party
is
on
--
the
small
political
party
--
mr.
jerry
gordon
that's
essentially
that's
right.
we
find
no
justification
for
keeping
a
small
bar
up.
now,
if
you're
to
ask
me
well,
can
one
person
insist
upon
the
right
to
be
--
no,
maybe
not.
requirements
may
be
reasonable
if
reasonable
is
nominal
or
minimal
but
the
small
political
party
is
on
the
ballot
in
many,
many
states
in
this
union
and
the
question
we
post
is
this,
if
there's
a
right
to
--
mr.
jerry
gordon
well,
we
have
suggested
the
guideline.
our
guideline
is
one-tenth
of
1%,
file
these
number
of
signatures
to
qualify
for
the
ballot.
one-tenth
of
1%
--
mr.
jerry
gordon
we
really
don't
think
there
should
be
any
until
it's
proven
that
a
problem
has
been
created.
now,
if
a
problem
is
created,
then
it's
time
to
take
a
new
look
but
this
court
has
said
time
and
time
again
and
all
the
controversies
before
referring
to
voting
rights,
the
court
has
said
this,
it
will
meticulously
scrutinize
any
impairment.
now,
i
submit
if
you
have
a
small
political
party
and
it's
not
on
the
ballot,
if
it's
not
able
to
meet
qualifications,
its
rights
have
been
impaired.
that's
obvious.
mr.
jerry
gordon
alright,
your
honor
--
mr.
jerry
gordon
that's
correct.
mr.
jerry
gordon
we
based
our
rights
on
a
number
of
sections
of
the
constitution
but
primarily
on
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
we'd
like
to
develop
that
in
this
way,
judge
kinneary
in
district
court
said
this,
he
said
that
if
the
wallace
party
is
not
placed
upon
the
ballot
that
it
will
not
have
equal
opportunity
and
that
it's
the
electors,
the
people
of
ohio
will
support
that
party
will
be
treated
as
second
class
electors.
and
that's
not
right
and
if
the
party
therefore
should
be
placed
on
the
ballot
but
in
the
same
breath
he
said
that
the
socialist
labor
party
because
it
is
small
does
not
have
a
similar
right.
now,
we
submit
that
this
type
of
philosophy
is
alien
to
basic
constitutional
tenants
and
guarantees
and
i
want
to
illustrate
an
example
in
any
other
area
involving
the
bill
of
rights
fundamental
rights.
this
type
of
doctrine
doesn't
apply.
for
example,
assume
in
a
southwest
--
a
community
in
the
southwest
part
of
this
country
a
restaurant
which
has
a
policy
in
segregation.
assume
that
the
restaurant,
the
owner
of
the
restaurant
will
not
permit
mexican-americans
or
negroes
to
eat
in
that
restaurant
and
a
class
suit
is
brought
by
representatives
of
both
groups.
now,
what
would
this
court
think
if
a
court
said,
well,
yes,
the
policy
denies
the
members
of
those
groups
equal
opportunity
and
then
it
treats
them
as
second
class
citizens
and
it
will
not
be
permitted?
but,
it
will
not
be
permitted
for
the
mexican-americans
because
in
this
community
they
are
substantial
section
of
the
population,
a
substantial
minority.
but
on
the
other
hand,
the
policy
will
be
permitted
for
negro-americans
because
there
is
small
minority,
that's
exactly
what
we
have
here.
mr.
jerry
gordon
your
honor,
i'm
only
using
judge
kinneary's
language,
he
said
himself
that
its
language
in
his
opinion
he
said
that
denying
wallace
a
position
on
the
ballot
would
be
treating
the
citizens
like
second
class
electors
and
denying
them
equality
of
opportunity.
mr.
jerry
gordon
alright,
--
mr.
jerry
gordon
but
we
agree
with
that,
we
agree,
we
think
both
parties
should
be
on
the
ballot.
we
think
that
there
is
an
impairment
of
the
right
of
the
small
political
party
when
it
is
kept
of
the
ballot
doesn't
have
its
name
on
ballot
the
same
as
the
logical
political
party
and
we
asked
this
question,
why
shouldn't
it
be
on
the
ballot?
the
question
is
not
why
shouldn't.
why
shouldn't
it,
why
shouldn't
it
co-equal
with
the
other
political
parties
it's
done
in
colorado,
it's
done
in
new
york.
mr.
jerry
gordon
it
gets
its
--
it
derives
its
right
from
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
here
is
a
classification
that's
being
established
of
a
percentage
which
is
too
high.
if
the
percentage
is
set
not
by
the
state
of
ohio,
not
by
the
ohio
legislature
--
mr.
jerry
gordon
yes,
the
proposal
that
we
have
made
is
one-tenth
of
1%
with
the
maximum
of
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
jerry
gordon
yes.
mr.
jerry
gordon
no,
your
honor
because
the
happy
medium
--
mr.
jerry
gordon
that's
correct.
mr.
jerry
gordon
no
your
honor,
we're
suggesting
that
as
a
sealing
on
this
basis
that
there
is
no
justification,
there
is
no
compelling
necessity
to
keep
a
small
party
off.
other
states
permit
the
small
political
party
is
not
--
mr.
jerry
gordon
i
would
say
this
your
honor,
that
problem
--
mr.
jerry
gordon
no,
it
would
not
be
good.
i
would
be
opposed
to
any
arbitrary
limitations.
mr.
jerry
gordon
if
the
--
mr.
jerry
gordon
yes,
it
might
if
that
happened
but
then
if
you
come
to
this
court
and
say,
well,
look
we
have
a
legitimate
problem
here.
the
ballot
is
just
too
large,
we've
got
a
bed
sheet
down
but
no
one
has
ever
developed
that
kind
of
evidence
for
a
court.
nobody
has
ever
shown
that
in
the
congressional
raise,
in
the
21st
congressional
district
in
ohio.
we
had
14
candidates
for
the
primary,
the
democratic
primary.
nobody
said,
well,
gee
look
how
long
his
ballot
is,
look
how
many
candidates
that
we
have
and
to
qualify.
to
qualify
to
run
for
congress
all
you
needed
was
100
signatures,
that's
a
nominal
requirement,
that's
okay.
but
if
we
had
14
third
parties
on
the
ballot,
the
election
officials
would
be
screaming
and
they
would
say
we've
got
to
elevate
way
up
and
bar
and
deprive
third
parties
of
their
rights
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
jerry
gordon
the
state
court?
no,
we
have
not
your
honor.
mr.
jerry
gordon
because
we
have
more
faith
in
federal
courts
than
in
state
courts
to
relief
the
type
of
problem
that
this
party
has
faced,
the
obliteration
of
its
rights.
we
have
a
case
since
--
mr.
jerry
gordon
you
mean
state
legislature
or
the
state
court?
mr.
jerry
gordon
the
state
legislature
is
run
by
two
political
parties
and
to
them
the
words
“third
party”
are
anathema.
their
desire
is
to
perpetuate
the
type
of
monopoly
a
political
power
which
they
have
enjoyed
over
the
years.
the
legislators
feel
--
mr.
jerry
gordon
it's
--
the
courts
are
much
more
detached
but
the
federal
courts
we
have
much
greater
faith
and
their
willingness
to
be
guardians
of
the
constitutional
rights
of
third
political
parties.
there
is
a
spirit
which
pervades
ohio
--
mr.
jerry
gordon
that's
right
your
honor.
we
thought
there
will
be
much
better
opportunity
for
getting
relief
in
federal
court.
mr.
jerry
gordon
well,
no.
the
party
attempted
to
assert
its
rights
over
the
years
but
it
did
not
have
the
resources.
this
was
the
major
cause
of
its
delay,
documents
have
been
filed
with
this
court
of
reports
to
convention
the
socialist
labor
party
where
the
question
is
raised
again
and
again.
the
party
did
go
to
court
in
1946
but
it
cost
a
lot
of
money.
it
just
didn't
have
that
kind
of
resources.
this
is
the
problem
of
the
small
political
party
in
america.
it
doesn't
have
a
lot
of
affluence,
it
doesn't
have
a
lot
of
memories
and
its
rights
are
taken
from
it.
mr.
jerry
gordon
they
can
vote
in
ohio
your
honor.
now,
before
the
rights
they
were
completely
excluded.
now,
they
have
the
right
in
vote.
mr.
jerry
gordon
they
have
to
write-in
but
there's
all
kind
of
problems
with
write-in
voting.
we
consider
--
mr.
jerry
gordon
well,
there's
a
vote
in
the
election
of
about
3
million.
mr.
jerry
gordon
your
honor,
of
the
socialist
labor
party
with
that
small
membership
is
--
was
on
the
ballot
for
75
years
--
mr.
jerry
gordon
yes,
we
say
that
the
state
of
ohio
cannot
deny
anybody
its
rights
to
be
on
the
ballot
unless
it
shows
the
compelling
justification
and
that
is
the
doctrine
in
all
other
phases
of
voting
right
cases
that
in
order
to
impair
when
we
talk
about
the
segregation
system
--
mr.
jerry
gordon
no,
we
do
think
there
has
to
be
a
practical
application
but
the
question
is
what
is
that
practical
application
for
the
state
of
washington
a
hundred
people
can
meet
on
a
convention
and
the
party
is
on
the
ballot.
in
the
state
of
new
york
12,000
signatures
can
be
obtained
and
a
party
is
on
a
ballot.
the
state
of
colorado
300
signatures
can
be
obtained,
the
party
is
on
a
ballot.
there's
a
series
of
states
like
this
where
it
is
possible
for
the
third
political
party
to
share
on
an
equal
basis
where
the
other
political
parties
in
the
state's
electoral
process
but
now
all
of
a
sudden
in
ohio
they've
got
this
horrendous
requirements
and
the
state
as
well
we
have
a
right
and
we
say,
no
they
don't
have
a
right.
if
the
other
states
can
carry
on
in
the
way
they
have
and
have
a
successful
electoral
system
and
make
room
in
their
process
for
the
participation
of
third
parties,
why
not
ohio,
why
not
the
other
states.
mr.
jerry
gordon
that
is
our
position
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
jerry
gordon
your
honor,
to
be
perfectly
candid
well,
the
question
of
placing
the
party
on
the
ballot
is
central
at
the
same
time
our
transcendent
concern
is
this,
what
you
referred
to
is
an
extreme
position
is
the
position
which
we
feel
ought
to
be
urged
upon
the
states.
we're
not
talking
about
this
court
legislating
for
the
states
only
setting
ceilings
because
what's
going
to
happen
supposing
that
this
court
can
decide
it
--
mr.
jerry
gordon
yes,
i
understand
that.
mr.
jerry
gordon
it
would
suffice
for
our
purposes
for
the
1968
elections
because
we
would
then
argue
as
follows
that
in
the
absence
of
any
restrictions
constitutionally
viable
restriction
imposed
by
the
state,
the
court
has
no
right
to
set
up
its
own
and
to
keep
a
political
party
off.
therefore,
the
district
court
here
shouldn't
place
the
party
on
the
ballot.
so,
we
would
meet
that
proposition
--
mr.
jerry
gordon
yes.
mr.
jerry
gordon
that's
correct
your
honor,
yes.
but
now,
let
me
--
that
would
be
one
branch
of
the
argument
but
the
second
branch
is
this,
in
the
absence
of
guidelines,
we
all
know
what
the
tests
are
now.
the
tests
are
--
any
statute
that's
going
to
regulate
the
accessibility
of
the
ballot
to
third
parties
as
we
understand
it,
the
judicially
determined
tests
are
it
must
meet
necessity,
equality,
and
reasonableness.
most
perfectly
obvious
there's
a
wide
variation
as
to
what
these
words
mean.
your
honors
have
heard
counsel
who
has
said
that
the
test
can
be
such
almost
anything
the
legislature
decides
is
constitutionally
permissible.
we
don't
agree
and
the
problem
we
face
now
even
if
this
court
--
mr.
jerry
gordon
well,
we're
referring
to
the
percentage
of
signatures
that
it
might
require.
we
--
as
far
as
the
elect
choosing
of
the
electors
we
think
that
if
the
legislature
is
going
to
have
electors
chosen
by
popular
vote
it's
got
to
do
it
pursuant
to
the
equal
protection
clause.
mr.
jerry
gordon
no,
we
do
not,
we
think
that
all
parties
have
to
share
and
that
if
any
are
going
to
be
kept
off
it's
going
to
be
on
a
reasonable
basis
in
compelling
necessity
has
to
be
shown
which
it
never
has
been
shown
with
respect
to
small
third
parties.
the
cost
for
example
placing
a
small
third
party
in
the
ballot
is
negligible.
it's
simply
a
matter
of
the
printer
setting
some
type.
this
country
and
the
states
spend
enormous
sums
of
money
on
many
other
things
of
dubious
value.
and
when
it
comes
to
election
which
is
the
heart
and
soul
of
our
constitutional
system
that's
no
time
to
practice
economy.
the
democratic
process
can't
be
measured
in
dollars
and
cents.
the
member
of
the
small
third
party
is
taxed.
his
taxes
flow
into
the
public
treasury
and
out
of
this
treasury
come
the
funds
to
pay
for
the
ballots.
now,
why
should
he
be
taxed,
this
is
a
due
process
argument
enforced
the
paper
ballots
which
exclude
this
party.
he
has
just
as
much
right
to
have
his
party
on
the
ballot
if
he
can
meet
minimal
standards
as
the
large
parties
just
as
the
small
minority
has
just
as
much
right
to
have
a
protection
against
segregation
laws
as
the
large
minority.
there's
--
that's
an
invidious
discrimination
and
we
again
urge
and
again
repeat
that
in
state
after
state
it
is
possible
for
third
political
parties
to
be
on
the
ballot.
we
are
concerned
what
ohio
is
going
to
do
in
ohio.
the
words
“third
party”
are
anathema.
that
state
legislature
is
going
to
go
back
and
if
this
15%
requirement
has
been
knocked
out,
they
are
going
to
consider
well,
what's
the
next
highest
one
we
consent.
we
don't
want
a
multiplicity
of
suits.
we
would
like
to
have
the
manner
settled
the
guidelines,
the
test
of
necessity,
equality
and
discrimination
are
not
precise
enough.
and
we
would
hope
and
urge
that
the
court
will
develop
clear
guidelines
which
would
preclude
arbitrary
action.
mr.
jerry
gordon
the
district
court's
decision
based
upon
wesberry
case,
reynolds
versus
sims,
this
language
flows
from
these
cases.
this
court
had
said
again
and
again
that
any
impairment
of
voting
rights
and
being
on
the
ballot
is
correlatively
right
to
vote.
mr.
jerry
gordon
no,
it
did
not
but
it
had
to
do
with
voting
rights.
mr.
jerry
gordon
no,
it's
a
different
but
it's
in
the
area
of
voting
rights
and
it
says
in
voting
rights
whenever
there's
any
impairment
or
infringement
it
cannot
be
constitutionally
warranted
unless
necessity
is
shown.
and
that
we've
quoted
those
cases
in
our
brief
and
we
think
that
this
court
has
said
that
any
impairment
has
to
be
meticulously
scrutinized.
well,
now,
if
other
states
are
able
to
have
election
laws
which
permit
third
party
participation
then
we
have
to
meticulously
scrutinized
those
days
which
impose
higher
restrictions
because
what
is
happening
is
this,
these
legislators
are
precluding
competition.
they
are
setting
standards
so
high
that
third
parties
and
independents
cannot
compete
not
just
because
of
their
fear
of
these
parties
but
also
because
of
the
splitting
votes.
if
i
may
your
honor
i'd
like
to
reserve
time.
mr.
jerry
gordon
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
jerry
gordon
no,
your
honor
--
mr.
jerry
gordon
what
they
have
done
is
reserved
space
--
mr.
jerry
gordon
--
on,
so
that
if
this
court
should
decide
to
place
the
candidates
on
the
ballot
then
it
will
be
no
particular
problem
in
that
county,
the
county
is
probably
unique
on
the
machine
as
well.
mr.
jerry
gordon
they
have
got
them
printed
yet,
there's
time.
mr.
jerry
gordon
well,
that's
correct
your
honor
and
we
have
stated
in
our
final
brief
filed
with
the
court
that
that
the
absentee
ballots
we
may
have
arrived
and
pointed
no
return
but
the
only
part,
the
only
ones
that
would
be
injured
this
court
should
decide
to
put
a
socialist
labor
party
candidates
on
the
ballot.
the
only
ones
that
would
be
injured
by
not
having
those
names
on
the
absentee
ballots
would
be
the
party
itself
and
it
would
gladly
waive
any
problems
having
to
do
with
absentee
ballots.
and
the
secretary
of
state
had
announced
that
wallace's
name
is
on
the
--
mr.
jerry
gordon
well,
the
secretary
of
state
your
honor
has
announced
that
wallace's
name
is
going
to
be
on
the
absentee
ballot
and
will
stay
on
regardless
of
any
future
decision
of
this
court
and
by
the
same
token
if
that's
the
case
then
the
--
so
another
words,
it's
possible
the
ballots
will
be
different.
mr.
jerry
gordon
well,
its
just
nothing
can
be
done
at
this
point.
the
absentee
ballots
when
we
talked
to
the
director
of
the
board
of
elections
and
we
think
it's
just
a
problem
that
probably
cannot
be
resolved,
speaking
now
only
of
the
absentee
ballots.
so,
we
really
have
no
choice.
mr.
jerry
gordon
well,
--
mr.
jerry
gordon
no,
your
honor,
they
would
all
have
the
right
to
vote
for
the
socialist
labor
party
by
the
write-in.
mr.
jerry
gordon
they
have
that
now
--
they
are
going
to
use
paper
ballots.
all
absentee
ballots
or
paper
ballots
as
we
understand
it
so
that
they
will
all
have
the
right
to
write
if
the
court
should
put
the
socialist
labor
party
candidates
on
the
ballot
those
who
cast
absentee
ballots
and
would
want
to
go
for
the
party
can
do
so
with
facility
because
it's
a
paper
ballot.
mr.
jerry
gordon
because
on
many
have
to
vote
by
virtue
of
voting
machine
and
as
we
have
shown
in
the
--
and
his
counsel
for
mr.
wallace
has
pointed
out
there's
all
kind
of
problems
in
casting
a
write-in
vote
in
the
voting
machine.
you've
got
to
have
that
mechanical
aptitude.
now,
that's
what
we
mean
by
an
invidious
discrimination.
it's
a
difference,
a
sizeable
difference
between
having
to
depend
on
the
right
info
with
all
of
complexities
of
a
voting
machine
and
simply
casting
a
vote.
they're
not
the
same,
the
race
is
not
the
same;
one
party
has
given
a
lead
in
front
from
the
others.
it's
not
equality
of
opportunity
and
we
don't
--
mr.
jerry
gordon
that's
right.
mr.
jerry
gordon
well,
there
is
that
your
honor
and
that's
why
a
political
party
which
consistently
runs
candidates
should
not
be
deprived
of
equal
opportunity
with
the
other
parties.
now,
if
you
have
some
individual
who
for
example
did
not
file
his
nominating
petition
in
time.
and
then
depends
upon
a
write-in
vote,
there
will
be
an
inequality
there
but
it's
not
a
serious
matter.
it
was
his
fault
he
didn't
file
in
time,
it's
a
one
time
only
proposition
and
there
is
inequality
but
at
least
he
has
the
chance
but
for
a
political
party
which
regularly
election
after
election
that
goes
to
polls,
certainly
it
should
have
as
much
opportunity
as
a
larger
party.
we
don't
have
this
discrimination
in
other
areas
of
law
relating
to
fundamental
freedoms.
we
should
not
have
it
in
the
political
field
either
which
is
perhaps
the
touchdown
of
the
other
freedoms.
mr.
jerry
gordon
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
jerry
gordon
may
it
please
the
court.
i'd
like
to
first
again
emphasize
that
the
socialist
labor
party,
small
though
it
was
and
is,
was
on
the
ballot
many,
many
times
in
the
course
of
ohio's
history,
documents
have
been
submitted
to
the
court.
what
we
actually
ask
is
that
the
party's
right
to
be
restored
that
were
taken
from
it
and
we'd
like
to
emphasize
this
that
in
many
other
areas
of
voting
rights
do
primarily
to
the
contributions
of
this
court
there
has
been
great
advance
and
progress,
rights
have
been
given
to
negroes
to
vote
and
to
women
to
vote
and
we
had
the
reapportionment
case
--
mr.
jerry
gordon
oh!
except
the
women
but
on
the
apportionment
cases
and
on
theory
matter
and
the
whole
members
--
mr.
jerry
gordon
well,
because
so
there
are
many
other
cases
such
as
louisiana
versus
united
states
where
the
right
was
circumscribed
by
the
way
it
was
implemented
by
the
actions
of
local
boards
of
elections.
and
the
court
has
struck
that
down
and
issued
decrease
and
in
that
case,
incidentally
the
court
said
that
a
decrease
should
not
only
prevent
--
illuminate
the
discrimination
which
had
existed
up
to
that
point
but
to
prevent
future
discrimination
as
well.
this
is
the
type
of
decree
we
seek
because
otherwise
we're
getting
to
go
back
to
ohio
and
go
to
through
the
same
--
same
experience
we've
had
before.
we
consider
inevitable
the
court
has
seen
the
resistance
and
hostility
of
these
appellees
and
these
pervades
ohio
to
third
parties.
we
asked
for
a
restoration
of
these
rights
and
the
year
1908
in
ohio,
the
democratic
candidate
for
governor
got
a
half
of
million
votes
that
republican
candidate
got
a
half
of
a
million
votes
and
the
socialist
labor
party
got
a
small
votes,
797
but
it
was
on
the
ballot.
it
didn't
bankrupt
ohio.
it's
possible
for
small
groups
of
people
to
enjoy
these
kind
of
rights
and
there's
no
reason
why
they
shouldn't.
we
note
in
other
areas
of
fundamental
right
such
as
the
first
amendment.
a
speaker
who
addresses
a
small
crowd
is
permitted
to
speak
just
as
the
speaker
who
addresses
the
large
crowd
and
we
would
never
be
suggested
that
the
rights
can
be
circumscribed
and
the
words
of
terminiello
versus
chicago.
to
circumscribe
those
rights
you'd
have
to
show
it
produces
a
clear
and
present
danger
of
a
serious
substantive
evil
that
rises
far
above
public
inconvenience.
all
that
we're
told
is
well,
there's
a
certain
inconvenience
to
have
a
small
party
on
the
ballot.
that's
not
our
reason
to
deny
the
right
of
that
party
to
compete
on
an
equal
basis
with
the
larger
political
parties.
what
we
asked
most
of
all
is
for
some
guidelines
to
the
state
to
prevent
a
repetition
of
the
experience
that
this
party
has
gone
through
where
it
went
for
decades,
enjoying
ballot
status
and
now
is
denied
that
status.
and
we
believe
that
the
guideline
should
be
that
states
can
regulate
the
accessibility
the
ballot
to
third
parties
but
not
more
than
as
absolutely
necessary
and
if
this
can
be
spelled
out
with
some
greater
clarity
in
precision
and
has
been
before,
this
would
certainly
advance
the
cost
of
participatory
democracy
and
the
rights
of
small
groups
to
participate.
we
have
today
many
small
groups
in
this
society
who
feel
strongly
have
burning
feelings
about
issues
and
are
capable
of
causing
substantial
disruption.
do
we
want
to
channel
the
discontent
and
the
dissent
in
to
the
electoral
process,
i
say
we
do.
but
if
we're
going
to
say
to
those
groups,
yes,
if
you
are
not
satisfied
with
our
institutions
the
way
to
express
your
dissent
to
sue
the
political
parties
but
do
it
through
either
the
democratic
or
republican
party,
we're
not
going
to
channel
the
discontent
through
this
type
because
they're
not
going
to
--
they're
not
going
to
participate
on
that
basis.
they
should
be
encouraged
to
form
the
wrong
political
groups
and
it
should
not
be
prohibitive
and
the
requirement
should
be
minimal
so
that
it's
easy
for
them
to
participate
on
the
political
process.
we
think
this
is
a
very
important
policy
consideration
which
should
inspire
the
court
to
make
the
accessibility
of
the
ballot
easy
and
to
encourage
groups
to
participate
in
this
area.
finally,
we
don't
think
that
this,
what
we
feel
to
be
an
invidious
discrimination
of
the
small
versus
the
large
should
be
dignified
by
excluding
the
socialist
labor
party
from
the
ballot
in
the
november
1968
elections
because
it
would
be
saying
in
effect.
this
has
been
the
main
rational
the
district
court
and
in
this
court's
decision
granting
temporary
injunctive
relief
where
the
point
was
made
there
had
been
some
delay.
what
was
quoted
in
that
order
was
what
the
district
court
had
said
about
the
small
size
of
the
party?
we
would
hope
this
court
would
not
dignify
a
position
which
says
that
the
larger
groups
shall
enjoy
these
rights
but
the
smaller
groups
can
--
mr.
jerry
gordon
yes,
your
honor.
we
did
call
franklin
county.
we
included
that
in
the
brief
we
filed
to
the
court
saturday.
we
were
never
told
that
it
was
impossible.
we
talked
to
vernon
bob
of
the
printing
company
and
he
did
indicate
some
very
large
problems
as
far
as
reprinting
strips
for
voting
machines.
there's
no
question
about
that
and
it
maybe
that
they
wouldn't
have
time
although
he
said,
well,
maybe
some
other
printers
could
do
it
but
then
there's
limitation
--
there's
limited
number
who
can.
but
we
say
this
and
we
make
this
categorical
statement,
there
is
time
to
print
paper
ballots
in
every
county
of
the
state.
there's
no
question
about
that
and
franklin
county
is
elsewhere.
we've
got
plenty
time
before
the
election
to
do
that.
and
if
members
of
this
court
were
prepared
to
make
such
an
order
in
mcdougal
versus
green
which
is
12
days
before
the
election,
certainly
with
twice
that
time
here
there's
time,
cuyahoga
county
has
started
making
its
paper
ballots
for
--
mr.
jerry
gordon
yes.
mr.
jerry
gordon
we
would
say
if
that's
what's
necessary
it
should
be
not.
it's
that
important,
it's
not
important
to
tell
the
people
of
ohio
we
have
seen
these
two
cases
come
up
together
from
the
very
inception
in
our
case
is
the
senior
case.
it's
then
important
to
tell
the
people
of
ohio
that
both
groups
shall
be
given
relief
and
not
one
or
the
other.
we
would
favor
both
groups
on
the
ballot
and
if
there
is
a
certain
disruption
of
the
electoral
process
that's
a
small
price
to
pay
for
democracy.
that's
a
small
price
to
pay
for
--
mr.
jerry
gordon
no.
we
state
in
our
brief
that
if
we
had
waited
--
if
we
sought
relief
now,
obviously
we
wouldn't
expect
much
response
from
the
court.
but
in
view
of
the
fact
that
there
is
time,
no
disruption
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
jerry
gordon
well,
i
would
hope
the
court
would
take
judicial
notice
of
the
fact
that
there
is
time
to
print
ballots
in
29
days
to
print
paper
ballots
in
the
state
of
ohio.
mr.
jerry
gordon
no,
your
honor,
not
the
absentee
ballots.
mr.
jerry
gordon
no,
because
the
absentee
ballots
should
go
out
as
they
are,
there
is
just
not
time
on
those.
that's
--
mr.
jerry
gordon
unless
they
could
write-in.
the
only
ones
that
would
suffer
--
well,
they
could
write-in
and
the
write-in
is
no
big
problem
with
paper
ballots
that's
what
they
will
have.
they
will
be
able
to
write-in
the
names
the
socialist
labor
party
candidates
which
they
can
do
anyway.
mr.
jerry
gordon
your
honor,
we
will
only
win
this
case
if
this
court
take
steps
to
preclude
a
recurrence
of
the
experience
that
we
have
had
in
ohio
where
the
rights
of
these
party
were
obliterated
only
if
guidelines
are
established
that
will
prevent,
that
will
establish
ceilings
on
the
ohio
legislature
because
otherwise
it's
just
as
inevitable
as
it
is
that
day
follows
the
night,
we
will
be
back
in
court
in
1969
again
challenging
the
new
statutes
which
they
passed.
mr.
jerry
gordon
we
say
this
your
honor
that
the
temporary
relief
was
granted
to
the
wallace
group
on
september
10.
we
got
the
order
in
september
11.
we
immediately
notified
and
asked
the
secretary
of
state
to
place
the
socialist
labor
party
candidates
on
the
ballot,
he
declined,
we
notified
him,
we
gave
him
notice
of
the
filing
of
a
motion.
mr.
jerry
gordon
that's
correct
your
honor
but
the
point
is
that
there
is
still
time
and
this
we
think
is
the
crucial
question.
we
recognize
this,
that
this
court
has
to
weigh
the
competing
equities
and
one
thing
it's
going
to
take
in
to
consideration
is
the
state
of
preparation
of
the
printing
of
the
ballots.
we
recognize
that,
all
we're
saying
is
this,
that
the
factors
on
the
other
side
outweigh
this
consideration
and
the
factors
are
these,
that
a
small
group,
the
rights
of
a
small
group
should
be
respected
to
the
same
extent
as
a
large
group
and
as
long
as
it
is
still
possible
for
that
small
group
to
have
a
place
on
the
ballot,
it
should
be
where
the
place
the
ballot
and
this
would
dramatize
by
placing
the
socialist
labor
party
in
the
ballot
it
would
dramatize
the
court's
adherence
to
that
basic
principle.
we
think
the
language
in
the
opinion
which
says
that
when
you
don't
--
when
you
have
to
rely
on
write-in
voting
and
you're
not
on
the
ballot
that
makes
you
a
second
class
elector
and
denies
your
equality
--
mr.
jerry
gordon
well,
that's
correct
your
honor
but
we
have
to
take
--
mr.
jerry
gordon
well,
the
party
didn't
wait
around.
the
documents
that
it
filed
with
this
court
showed
that
year
after
year
it
was
trying
to
get
relief
but
it
didn't
have
the
resources
to
finance
this
type
of
legal
challenge.
the
party
wasn't
waiting
around.
we
have
this
problem
in
our
society
that
people
do
not
assert
their
rights
because
they
are
unable
to.
and
it
was
only
because
the
american
civil
liberties
union
took
this
case
up
that
the
case
is
here
today.
mr.
jerry
gordon
that's
right
and
there
was
admittedly
some
delay.
we
recognize
this
is
a
factor
too
that
the
courts
go
in
a
way.
but
there
are
these
other
factors
which
outweigh
it.
we
think
it
would
be
a
grave
tragedy
if
the
one
party,
the
party
stand
on
the
opposite
ends
of
the
political
spectrum.
we're
not
anticipating
what
this
court
is
going
to
do
we
know
better
than
that
but
we're
just
saying
this
--
we
--
our
position
is
all
party
should
be
on
the
ballot
that
if
the
ballot
is
going
to
be
opened
the
time
to
do
it
is
now,
not
later.
i
don't
want
treat
any
further
this
question
of
whether
we
raise
this
in
the
court
below
because
i
think
we
documented
it
in
the
papers
that
we
filed.
we
agree
that
the
prayer
could've
been
somewhat
clear
but
we
have
documented
in
the
brief,
filed
it
saturday
that
we
certainly
did
request
this
believing
this
relief
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
district
court
did
say
that
the
main
objective
of
both
cases
is
for
valid
status.
we
think
this
question
is
so
important
that
you
cannot
impair
rights
of
small
groups
without
showing
a
compelling
necessity,
it
never
has
been
shown.
therefore,
if
socialist
labor
party
like
the
democrats
or
republicans
should
enjoy
equal
rights
and
if
this
is
an
election
race,
the
race
should
start
at
the
same
place.
thank
you
very
much,
your
honor.
mr.
jerry
gordon
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
jerry
gordon
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court,
this
is
the
companion
action
in
the
case
below
the
appellants
were
plaintiffs
in
the
district
court
in
the
southern
district
of
ohio,
they
are
the
socialist
labor
party
of
america
and
its
ohio
members.
they
brought
suit
to
challenge
an
ohio
electoral
system
which
completely
excluded
them
from
participating
on
an
equal
basis
with
the
other
political
parties
in
ohio
or
even
an
unequal
basis.
their
rights
as
a
political
party
were
in
effect
obliterated
by
a
series
of
ohio
election
laws.
they
challenged
those
laws,
a
declaratory
judgment
favorable
to
their
position
was
rendered,
right
in
voting
was
provided
for
the
november
1968
general
election,
ballot
position
was
denied.
from
that
branch
of
the
opinion
denying
ballot
position,
we
appeal.
socialist
labor
party
of
america
is
a
national
political
party
with
roots
reaching
back
into
the
19th
century.
it
advocates
the
socialist
reconstruction
american
society
and
it
advocates
that
this
be
brought
about
to
the
ballot.
it
has
never
used
any
other
means
but
peaceful
constitutional
means
to
advance
it
to
position.
accordingly,
it
places
great
emphasize
on
elections.
it
is
currently
in
its
20th
consecutive
presidential
campaign.
in
1964
presidential
elections,
it
was
on
the
ballot
in
16
states
conducted
a
write-in
campaign
in
nine
others.
similarly,
it
has
been
on
the
ballot
in
ohio
going
back
into
the
19th
century.
now,
the
party
in
ohio
has
modest
numbers
pursuant
to
the
request
of
the
district
court
documents
were
submitted
which
show
to
the
parties
members
equal
in
some
approximately
108.
these
documents
also
show
that
the
party
distributed
in
single
year
and
this
is
customary
approximately
a
quarter
of
million
of
a
pieces
of
literature
leaflets.
it
is
a
small
party
but
an
energetic
one.
mr.
jerry
gordon
we
take
issue
with
that
position,
your
honor.
we
did
apply
for
equivalent
relief
--
mr.
jerry
gordon
that's
correct.
mr.
jerry
gordon
that's
right.
mr.
jerry
gordon
we
have
that
problem
but
it's
out
position
that
there
is
more
than
ample
opportunity
to
print
ballots
or
if
it's
necessary
to
reprint
ballots
which
in
our
judgment
will
conform
to
the
imperatives
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
its
equal
protection
clause.
mr.
jerry
gordon
well,
for
one
thing
and
counsel
on
both
sides
have
to
rely
in
representations
to
the
court
that
is
what
we
do.
we've
been
in
touch
with
some
10
counties.
now,
in
four
of
these
counties,
ballots
have
been
printed,
completely
printed.
and
another
four
counties,
ballots
are
in
process
of
being
printed.
now,
cuyahoga
county
and
in
mahoning
county,
ballots
are
going
to
be
printed
next
week.
there
are
still
opportunity
and
if
it's
possible
in
a
county
the
size
of
cuyahoga
county
which
is
the
most
largely
populated,
densely
populated
county
in
ohio
they
still
print
ballots
for
the
general
election,
then
we
submit
that
it
is
possible
in
every
other
county.
we
are
after
all
some
29
days
before
the
election.
we
have
many,
many
printers.
it's
still
possible
to
print
ballots
in
time
for
that
election.
the
mcdougal
versus
green
are
only
12
days
before
the
election
(voice
overlap).
mr.
jerry
gordon
we
would
concede
that
there
will
be
a
great
practical
problem
as
far
as
programming
machines.
we
are
not
able
to
represent
--
mr.
jerry
gordon
well,
your
honor
it
varies
widely
in
franklin
county
all
the
--
mr.
jerry
gordon
well,
we
have
88
different
systems.
we
don't
have
those
statistics.
mr.
jerry
gordon
well,
i'm
unable
to
say
--
mr.
jerry
gordon
well,
in
cuyahoga
county
it's
much
less
than,
in
franklin
county
it's
all.
so,
may
mean
that
if
we
secure
the
order
that
we
seek
and
we'd
like
to
argue
why
we
feel
the
order
should
be
rendered
despite
the
practical
difficulties
that
counties
have
planned
to
conduct
their
elections
via
voting
machines
may
have
to
use
paper
ballots.
this
may
be
the
case
but
at
any
rate
t
is
certainly
possible
at
this
juncture
to
print
paper
ballots,
there's
plenty
of
time
for
the
entire
state.
and
for
cuyahoga
county,
their
voting
machines
have
already
been
programmed
to
provide
for
the
socialist
labor
party
candidates
any
event
this
court
does
order
those
candidates
be
placed
in
the
ballot.
mr.
jerry
gordon
when
were
the
candidates
selected?
mr.
jerry
gordon
the
candidates
were
selected
by
the
socialist
labor
party
its
national
candidates
at
it's
convention
in
may
of
this
year.
mr.
jerry
gordon
well,
no
your
honor
although
i
don't
think
that
rule
by
itself
precludes
--
i
was
getting
on
the
ballots
because
the
other
parties
didn't
nominate
their
candidates
until
august.
mr.
jerry
gordon
who
was
the
candidate
of
the
socialist
labor
party
for
president
four
years
ago?
mr.
jerry
gordon
i'm
not
--
mr.
jerry
gordon
well,
let
me
go
to
the
next
question
because
i'm
not
sure
who
the
candidates
of
the
party
were.
i
know
that
they
are
this
time,
they
are
blowman
and
taylor.
the
reasons
that
the
socialist
labor
party
did
not
bring
its
suit
earlier,
now,
the
documents
submitted
to
the
court
this
question
is
covered
in
reports
to
the
state
conventions.
party
was
anxious
to
test
the
constitutional
of
these
laws
some
years
passed.
it
simply
didn't
have
the
resources,
in
1946,
it
qualified
for
the
ballot
in
ohio
had
to
file
30,000
signatures
to
qualify
its
candidate
for
governor,
it
filed
45,000.
and
what
happened?
the
board
of
election
said,
not
enough
signatures
had
been
filed.
the
party
had
to
file
mandamus
action
in
ohio
supreme
court
and
finally
got
an
order
and
put
their
candidate
on
the
ballot
but
that
exhausted
the
party's
resources.
it's
a
small
party
and
it's
not
affluent
party
and
it
--
for
over
a
period
of
years
it
attempted
to
get
counsel
which
could
pursue
this
action
and
was
unable
to
finance
it.
and
this
case
it
has
been
brought
by
the
civil
liberties
union,
that's
the
only
way
the
party
has
been
able
to
advance
its
position
and
challenge
these
laws.
now,
--
mr.
jerry
gordon
it
has
--
the
party
shows
a
membership
of
108
in
ohio
as
of
1966.
mr.
jerry
gordon
i'm
sorry
i
didn't
understand.
mr.
jerry
gordon
more
candidates?
mr.
jerry
gordon
counties?
mr.
jerry
gordon
i
suppose
there
are
but
there's
many
states
where
a
party
of
108
it
has
no
difficulty
whatever
in
getting
on
the
ballot.
in
the
state
of
washington
100
people
can
come
together.
mr.
jerry
gordon
that's
correct
your
honor.
we
say
this
that
a
small
political
party
has
an
absolute
constitutional
right
to
be
on
the
ballot
unless
a
state
can
prove
and
can
show
a
compelling
necessity
which
would
justify
legislation
which
has
the
effect
of
excluding
that
party
from
the
ballot.
the
rights
of
the
members
of
the
small
party
to
be
on
the
ballot
are
just
as
important
to
them
perhaps
more
so
than
the
rights
of
the
members
of
a
large
political
party.
one
is
just
as
important
as
the
other.
mr.
jerry
gordon
well,
no
your
honor.
we
added
a
branch
to
that.
we
said
subject
to
--
if
a
state
can
prove
a
compelling
justification
to
--
mr.
jerry
gordon
it's
hard
for
me
to,
your
honor,
because
we've
examined
the
reasons
that
have
historically
been
offered
and
we
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
jerry
gordon
the
party
is
on
--
the
small
political
party
--
mr.
jerry
gordon
that's
essentially
that's
right.
we
find
no
justification
for
keeping
a
small
bar
up.
now,
if
you're
to
ask
me
well,
can
one
person
insist
upon
the
right
to
be
--
no,
maybe
not.
requirements
may
be
reasonable
if
reasonable
is
nominal
or
minimal
but
the
small
political
party
is
on
the
ballot
in
many,
many
states
in
this
union
and
the
question
we
post
is
this,
if
there's
a
right
to
--
mr.
jerry
gordon
well,
we
have
suggested
the
guideline.
our
guideline
is
one-tenth
of
1%,
file
these
number
of
signatures
to
qualify
for
the
ballot.
one-tenth
of
1%
--
mr.
jerry
gordon
we
really
don't
think
there
should
be
any
until
it's
proven
that
a
problem
has
been
created.
now,
if
a
problem
is
created,
then
it's
time
to
take
a
new
look
but
this
court
has
said
time
and
time
again
and
all
the
controversies
before
referring
to
voting
rights,
the
court
has
said
this,
it
will
meticulously
scrutinize
any
impairment.
now,
i
submit
if
you
have
a
small
political
party
and
it's
not
on
the
ballot,
if
it's
not
able
to
meet
qualifications,
its
rights
have
been
impaired.
that's
obvious.
mr.
jerry
gordon
alright,
your
honor
--
mr.
jerry
gordon
that's
correct.
mr.
jerry
gordon
we
based
our
rights
on
a
number
of
sections
of
the
constitution
but
primarily
on
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
we'd
like
to
develop
that
in
this
way,
judge
kinneary
in
district
court
said
this,
he
said
that
if
the
wallace
party
is
not
placed
upon
the
ballot
that
it
will
not
have
equal
opportunity
and
that
it's
the
electors,
the
people
of
ohio
will
support
that
party
will
be
treated
as
second
class
electors.
and
that's
not
right
and
if
the
party
therefore
should
be
placed
on
the
ballot
but
in
the
same
breath
he
said
that
the
socialist
labor
party
because
it
is
small
does
not
have
a
similar
right.
now,
we
submit
that
this
type
of
philosophy
is
alien
to
basic
constitutional
tenants
and
guarantees
and
i
want
to
illustrate
an
example
in
any
other
area
involving
the
bill
of
rights
fundamental
rights.
this
type
of
doctrine
doesn't
apply.
for
example,
assume
in
a
southwest
--
a
community
in
the
southwest
part
of
this
country
a
restaurant
which
has
a
policy
in
segregation.
assume
that
the
restaurant,
the
owner
of
the
restaurant
will
not
permit
mexican-americans
or
negroes
to
eat
in
that
restaurant
and
a
class
suit
is
brought
by
representatives
of
both
groups.
now,
what
would
this
court
think
if
a
court
said,
well,
yes,
the
policy
denies
the
members
of
those
groups
equal
opportunity
and
then
it
treats
them
as
second
class
citizens
and
it
will
not
be
permitted?
but,
it
will
not
be
permitted
for
the
mexican-americans
because
in
this
community
they
are
substantial
section
of
the
population,
a
substantial
minority.
but
on
the
other
hand,
the
policy
will
be
permitted
for
negro-americans
because
there
is
small
minority,
that's
exactly
what
we
have
here.
mr.
jerry
gordon
your
honor,
i'm
only
using
judge
kinneary's
language,
he
said
himself
that
its
language
in
his
opinion
he
said
that
denying
wallace
a
position
on
the
ballot
would
be
treating
the
citizens
like
second
class
electors
and
denying
them
equality
of
opportunity.
mr.
jerry
gordon
alright,
--
mr.
jerry
gordon
but
we
agree
with
that,
we
agree,
we
think
both
parties
should
be
on
the
ballot.
we
think
that
there
is
an
impairment
of
the
right
of
the
small
political
party
when
it
is
kept
of
the
ballot
doesn't
have
its
name
on
ballot
the
same
as
the
logical
political
party
and
we
asked
this
question,
why
shouldn't
it
be
on
the
ballot?
the
question
is
not
why
shouldn't.
why
shouldn't
it,
why
shouldn't
it
co-equal
with
the
other
political
parties
it's
done
in
colorado,
it's
done
in
new
york.
mr.
jerry
gordon
it
gets
its
--
it
derives
its
right
from
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
here
is
a
classification
that's
being
established
of
a
percentage
which
is
too
high.
if
the
percentage
is
set
not
by
the
state
of
ohio,
not
by
the
ohio
legislature
--
mr.
jerry
gordon
yes,
the
proposal
that
we
have
made
is
one-tenth
of
1%
with
the
maximum
of
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
jerry
gordon
yes.
mr.
jerry
gordon
no,
your
honor
because
the
happy
medium
--
mr.
jerry
gordon
that's
correct.
mr.
jerry
gordon
no
your
honor,
we're
suggesting
that
as
a
sealing
on
this
basis
that
there
is
no
justification,
there
is
no
compelling
necessity
to
keep
a
small
party
off.
other
states
permit
the
small
political
party
is
not
--
mr.
jerry
gordon
i
would
say
this
your
honor,
that
problem
--
mr.
jerry
gordon
no,
it
would
not
be
good.
i
would
be
opposed
to
any
arbitrary
limitations.
mr.
jerry
gordon
if
the
--
mr.
jerry
gordon
yes,
it
might
if
that
happened
but
then
if
you
come
to
this
court
and
say,
well,
look
we
have
a
legitimate
problem
here.
the
ballot
is
just
too
large,
we've
got
a
bed
sheet
down
but
no
one
has
ever
developed
that
kind
of
evidence
for
a
court.
nobody
has
ever
shown
that
in
the
congressional
raise,
in
the
21st
congressional
district
in
ohio.
we
had
14
candidates
for
the
primary,
the
democratic
primary.
nobody
said,
well,
gee
look
how
long
his
ballot
is,
look
how
many
candidates
that
we
have
and
to
qualify.
to
qualify
to
run
for
congress
all
you
needed
was
100
signatures,
that's
a
nominal
requirement,
that's
okay.
but
if
we
had
14
third
parties
on
the
ballot,
the
election
officials
would
be
screaming
and
they
would
say
we've
got
to
elevate
way
up
and
bar
and
deprive
third
parties
of
their
rights
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
jerry
gordon
the
state
court?
no,
we
have
not
your
honor.
mr.
jerry
gordon
because
we
have
more
faith
in
federal
courts
than
in
state
courts
to
relief
the
type
of
problem
that
this
party
has
faced,
the
obliteration
of
its
rights.
we
have
a
case
since
--
mr.
jerry
gordon
you
mean
state
legislature
or
the
state
court?
mr.
jerry
gordon
the
state
legislature
is
run
by
two
political
parties
and
to
them
the
words
“third
party”
are
anathema.
their
desire
is
to
perpetuate
the
type
of
monopoly
a
political
power
which
they
have
enjoyed
over
the
years.
the
legislators
feel
--
mr.
jerry
gordon
it's
--
the
courts
are
much
more
detached
but
the
federal
courts
we
have
much
greater
faith
and
their
willingness
to
be
guardians
of
the
constitutional
rights
of
third
political
parties.
there
is
a
spirit
which
pervades
ohio
--
mr.
jerry
gordon
that's
right
your
honor.
we
thought
there
will
be
much
better
opportunity
for
getting
relief
in
federal
court.
mr.
jerry
gordon
well,
no.
the
party
attempted
to
assert
its
rights
over
the
years
but
it
did
not
have
the
resources.
this
was
the
major
cause
of
its
delay,
documents
have
been
filed
with
this
court
of
reports
to
convention
the
socialist
labor
party
where
the
question
is
raised
again
and
again.
the
party
did
go
to
court
in
1946
but
it
cost
a
lot
of
money.
it
just
didn't
have
that
kind
of
resources.
this
is
the
problem
of
the
small
political
party
in
america.
it
doesn't
have
a
lot
of
affluence,
it
doesn't
have
a
lot
of
memories
and
its
rights
are
taken
from
it.
mr.
jerry
gordon
they
can
vote
in
ohio
your
honor.
now,
before
the
rights
they
were
completely
excluded.
now,
they
have
the
right
in
vote.
mr.
jerry
gordon
they
have
to
write-in
but
there's
all
kind
of
problems
with
write-in
voting.
we
consider
--
mr.
jerry
gordon
well,
there's
a
vote
in
the
election
of
about
3
million.
mr.
jerry
gordon
your
honor,
of
the
socialist
labor
party
with
that
small
membership
is
--
was
on
the
ballot
for
75
years
--
mr.
jerry
gordon
yes,
we
say
that
the
state
of
ohio
cannot
deny
anybody
its
rights
to
be
on
the
ballot
unless
it
shows
the
compelling
justification
and
that
is
the
doctrine
in
all
other
phases
of
voting
right
cases
that
in
order
to
impair
when
we
talk
about
the
segregation
system
--
mr.
jerry
gordon
no,
we
do
think
there
has
to
be
a
practical
application
but
the
question
is
what
is
that
practical
application
for
the
state
of
washington
a
hundred
people
can
meet
on
a
convention
and
the
party
is
on
the
ballot.
in
the
state
of
new
york
12,000
signatures
can
be
obtained
and
a
party
is
on
a
ballot.
the
state
of
colorado
300
signatures
can
be
obtained,
the
party
is
on
a
ballot.
there's
a
series
of
states
like
this
where
it
is
possible
for
the
third
political
party
to
share
on
an
equal
basis
where
the
other
political
parties
in
the
state's
electoral
process
but
now
all
of
a
sudden
in
ohio
they've
got
this
horrendous
requirements
and
the
state
as
well
we
have
a
right
and
we
say,
no
they
don't
have
a
right.
if
the
other
states
can
carry
on
in
the
way
they
have
and
have
a
successful
electoral
system
and
make
room
in
their
process
for
the
participation
of
third
parties,
why
not
ohio,
why
not
the
other
states.
mr.
jerry
gordon
that
is
our
position
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
jerry
gordon
your
honor,
to
be
perfectly
candid
well,
the
question
of
placing
the
party
on
the
ballot
is
central
at
the
same
time
our
transcendent
concern
is
this,
what
you
referred
to
is
an
extreme
position
is
the
position
which
we
feel
ought
to
be
urged
upon
the
states.
we're
not
talking
about
this
court
legislating
for
the
states
only
setting
ceilings
because
what's
going
to
happen
supposing
that
this
court
can
decide
it
--
mr.
jerry
gordon
yes,
i
understand
that.
mr.
jerry
gordon
it
would
suffice
for
our
purposes
for
the
1968
elections
because
we
would
then
argue
as
follows
that
in
the
absence
of
any
restrictions
constitutionally
viable
restriction
imposed
by
the
state,
the
court
has
no
right
to
set
up
its
own
and
to
keep
a
political
party
off.
therefore,
the
district
court
here
shouldn't
place
the
party
on
the
ballot.
so,
we
would
meet
that
proposition
--
mr.
jerry
gordon
yes.
mr.
jerry
gordon
that's
correct
your
honor,
yes.
but
now,
let
me
--
that
would
be
one
branch
of
the
argument
but
the
second
branch
is
this,
in
the
absence
of
guidelines,
we
all
know
what
the
tests
are
now.
the
tests
are
--
any
statute
that's
going
to
regulate
the
accessibility
of
the
ballot
to
third
parties
as
we
understand
it,
the
judicially
determined
tests
are
it
must
meet
necessity,
equality,
and
reasonableness.
most
perfectly
obvious
there's
a
wide
variation
as
to
what
these
words
mean.
your
honors
have
heard
counsel
who
has
said
that
the
test
can
be
such
almost
anything
the
legislature
decides
is
constitutionally
permissible.
we
don't
agree
and
the
problem
we
face
now
even
if
this
court
--
mr.
jerry
gordon
well,
we're
referring
to
the
percentage
of
signatures
that
it
might
require.
we
--
as
far
as
the
elect
choosing
of
the
electors
we
think
that
if
the
legislature
is
going
to
have
electors
chosen
by
popular
vote
it's
got
to
do
it
pursuant
to
the
equal
protection
clause.
mr.
jerry
gordon
no,
we
do
not,
we
think
that
all
parties
have
to
share
and
that
if
any
are
going
to
be
kept
off
it's
going
to
be
on
a
reasonable
basis
in
compelling
necessity
has
to
be
shown
which
it
never
has
been
shown
with
respect
to
small
third
parties.
the
cost
for
example
placing
a
small
third
party
in
the
ballot
is
negligible.
it's
simply
a
matter
of
the
printer
setting
some
type.
this
country
and
the
states
spend
enormous
sums
of
money
on
many
other
things
of
dubious
value.
and
when
it
comes
to
election
which
is
the
heart
and
soul
of
our
constitutional
system
that's
no
time
to
practice
economy.
the
democratic
process
can't
be
measured
in
dollars
and
cents.
the
member
of
the
small
third
party
is
taxed.
his
taxes
flow
into
the
public
treasury
and
out
of
this
treasury
come
the
funds
to
pay
for
the
ballots.
now,
why
should
he
be
taxed,
this
is
a
due
process
argument
enforced
the
paper
ballots
which
exclude
this
party.
he
has
just
as
much
right
to
have
his
party
on
the
ballot
if
he
can
meet
minimal
standards
as
the
large
parties
just
as
the
small
minority
has
just
as
much
right
to
have
a
protection
against
segregation
laws
as
the
large
minority.
there's
--
that's
an
invidious
discrimination
and
we
again
urge
and
again
repeat
that
in
state
after
state
it
is
possible
for
third
political
parties
to
be
on
the
ballot.
we
are
concerned
what
ohio
is
going
to
do
in
ohio.
the
words
“third
party”
are
anathema.
that
state
legislature
is
going
to
go
back
and
if
this
15%
requirement
has
been
knocked
out,
they
are
going
to
consider
well,
what's
the
next
highest
one
we
consent.
we
don't
want
a
multiplicity
of
suits.
we
would
like
to
have
the
manner
settled
the
guidelines,
the
test
of
necessity,
equality
and
discrimination
are
not
precise
enough.
and
we
would
hope
and
urge
that
the
court
will
develop
clear
guidelines
which
would
preclude
arbitrary
action.
mr.
jerry
gordon
the
district
court's
decision
based
upon
wesberry
case,
reynolds
versus
sims,
this
language
flows
from
these
cases.
this
court
had
said
again
and
again
that
any
impairment
of
voting
rights
and
being
on
the
ballot
is
correlatively
right
to
vote.
mr.
jerry
gordon
no,
it
did
not
but
it
had
to
do
with
voting
rights.
mr.
jerry
gordon
no,
it's
a
different
but
it's
in
the
area
of
voting
rights
and
it
says
in
voting
rights
whenever
there's
any
impairment
or
infringement
it
cannot
be
constitutionally
warranted
unless
necessity
is
shown.
and
that
we've
quoted
those
cases
in
our
brief
and
we
think
that
this
court
has
said
that
any
impairment
has
to
be
meticulously
scrutinized.
well,
now,
if
other
states
are
able
to
have
election
laws
which
permit
third
party
participation
then
we
have
to
meticulously
scrutinized
those
days
which
impose
higher
restrictions
because
what
is
happening
is
this,
these
legislators
are
precluding
competition.
they
are
setting
standards
so
high
that
third
parties
and
independents
cannot
compete
not
just
because
of
their
fear
of
these
parties
but
also
because
of
the
splitting
votes.
if
i
may
your
honor
i'd
like
to
reserve
time.
mr.
jerry
gordon
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
jerry
gordon
no,
your
honor
--
mr.
jerry
gordon
what
they
have
done
is
reserved
space
--
mr.
jerry
gordon
--
on,
so
that
if
this
court
should
decide
to
place
the
candidates
on
the
ballot
then
it
will
be
no
particular
problem
in
that
county,
the
county
is
probably
unique
on
the
machine
as
well.
mr.
jerry
gordon
they
have
got
them
printed
yet,
there's
time.
mr.
jerry
gordon
well,
that's
correct
your
honor
and
we
have
stated
in
our
final
brief
filed
with
the
court
that
that
the
absentee
ballots
we
may
have
arrived
and
pointed
no
return
but
the
only
part,
the
only
ones
that
would
be
injured
this
court
should
decide
to
put
a
socialist
labor
party
candidates
on
the
ballot.
the
only
ones
that
would
be
injured
by
not
having
those
names
on
the
absentee
ballots
would
be
the
party
itself
and
it
would
gladly
waive
any
problems
having
to
do
with
absentee
ballots.
and
the
secretary
of
state
had
announced
that
wallace's
name
is
on
the
--
mr.
jerry
gordon
well,
the
secretary
of
state
your
honor
has
announced
that
wallace's
name
is
going
to
be
on
the
absentee
ballot
and
will
stay
on
regardless
of
any
future
decision
of
this
court
and
by
the
same
token
if
that's
the
case
then
the
--
so
another
words,
it's
possible
the
ballots
will
be
different.
mr.
jerry
gordon
well,
its
just
nothing
can
be
done
at
this
point.
the
absentee
ballots
when
we
talked
to
the
director
of
the
board
of
elections
and
we
think
it's
just
a
problem
that
probably
cannot
be
resolved,
speaking
now
only
of
the
absentee
ballots.
so,
we
really
have
no
choice.
mr.
jerry
gordon
well,
--
mr.
jerry
gordon
no,
your
honor,
they
would
all
have
the
right
to
vote
for
the
socialist
labor
party
by
the
write-in.
mr.
jerry
gordon
they
have
that
now
--
they
are
going
to
use
paper
ballots.
all
absentee
ballots
or
paper
ballots
as
we
understand
it
so
that
they
will
all
have
the
right
to
write
if
the
court
should
put
the
socialist
labor
party
candidates
on
the
ballot
those
who
cast
absentee
ballots
and
would
want
to
go
for
the
party
can
do
so
with
facility
because
it's
a
paper
ballot.
mr.
jerry
gordon
because
on
many
have
to
vote
by
virtue
of
voting
machine
and
as
we
have
shown
in
the
--
and
his
counsel
for
mr.
wallace
has
pointed
out
there's
all
kind
of
problems
in
casting
a
write-in
vote
in
the
voting
machine.
you've
got
to
have
that
mechanical
aptitude.
now,
that's
what
we
mean
by
an
invidious
discrimination.
it's
a
difference,
a
sizeable
difference
between
having
to
depend
on
the
right
info
with
all
of
complexities
of
a
voting
machine
and
simply
casting
a
vote.
they're
not
the
same,
the
race
is
not
the
same;
one
party
has
given
a
lead
in
front
from
the
others.
it's
not
equality
of
opportunity
and
we
don't
--
mr.
jerry
gordon
that's
right.
mr.
jerry
gordon
well,
there
is
that
your
honor
and
that's
why
a
political
party
which
consistently
runs
candidates
should
not
be
deprived
of
equal
opportunity
with
the
other
parties.
now,
if
you
have
some
individual
who
for
example
did
not
file
his
nominating
petition
in
time.
and
then
depends
upon
a
write-in
vote,
there
will
be
an
inequality
there
but
it's
not
a
serious
matter.
it
was
his
fault
he
didn't
file
in
time,
it's
a
one
time
only
proposition
and
there
is
inequality
but
at
least
he
has
the
chance
but
for
a
political
party
which
regularly
election
after
election
that
goes
to
polls,
certainly
it
should
have
as
much
opportunity
as
a
larger
party.
we
don't
have
this
discrimination
in
other
areas
of
law
relating
to
fundamental
freedoms.
we
should
not
have
it
in
the
political
field
either
which
is
perhaps
the
touchdown
of
the
other
freedoms.
mr.
jerry
gordon
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
jerry
gordon
may
it
please
the
court.
i'd
like
to
first
again
emphasize
that
the
socialist
labor
party,
small
though
it
was
and
is,
was
on
the
ballot
many,
many
times
in
the
course
of
ohio's
history,
documents
have
been
submitted
to
the
court.
what
we
actually
ask
is
that
the
party's
right
to
be
restored
that
were
taken
from
it
and
we'd
like
to
emphasize
this
that
in
many
other
areas
of
voting
rights
do
primarily
to
the
contributions
of
this
court
there
has
been
great
advance
and
progress,
rights
have
been
given
to
negroes
to
vote
and
to
women
to
vote
and
we
had
the
reapportionment
case
--
mr.
jerry
gordon
oh!
except
the
women
but
on
the
apportionment
cases
and
on
theory
matter
and
the
whole
members
--
mr.
jerry
gordon
well,
because
so
there
are
many
other
cases
such
as
louisiana
versus
united
states
where
the
right
was
circumscribed
by
the
way
it
was
implemented
by
the
actions
of
local
boards
of
elections.
and
the
court
has
struck
that
down
and
issued
decrease
and
in
that
case,
incidentally
the
court
said
that
a
decrease
should
not
only
prevent
--
illuminate
the
discrimination
which
had
existed
up
to
that
point
but
to
prevent
future
discrimination
as
well.
this
is
the
type
of
decree
we
seek
because
otherwise
we're
getting
to
go
back
to
ohio
and
go
to
through
the
same
--
same
experience
we've
had
before.
we
consider
inevitable
the
court
has
seen
the
resistance
and
hostility
of
these
appellees
and
these
pervades
ohio
to
third
parties.
we
asked
for
a
restoration
of
these
rights
and
the
year
1908
in
ohio,
the
democratic
candidate
for
governor
got
a
half
of
million
votes
that
republican
candidate
got
a
half
of
a
million
votes
and
the
socialist
labor
party
got
a
small
votes,
797
but
it
was
on
the
ballot.
it
didn't
bankrupt
ohio.
it's
possible
for
small
groups
of
people
to
enjoy
these
kind
of
rights
and
there's
no
reason
why
they
shouldn't.
we
note
in
other
areas
of
fundamental
right
such
as
the
first
amendment.
a
speaker
who
addresses
a
small
crowd
is
permitted
to
speak
just
as
the
speaker
who
addresses
the
large
crowd
and
we
would
never
be
suggested
that
the
rights
can
be
circumscribed
and
the
words
of
terminiello
versus
chicago.
to
circumscribe
those
rights
you'd
have
to
show
it
produces
a
clear
and
present
danger
of
a
serious
substantive
evil
that
rises
far
above
public
inconvenience.
all
that
we're
told
is
well,
there's
a
certain
inconvenience
to
have
a
small
party
on
the
ballot.
that's
not
our
reason
to
deny
the
right
of
that
party
to
compete
on
an
equal
basis
with
the
larger
political
parties.
what
we
asked
most
of
all
is
for
some
guidelines
to
the
state
to
prevent
a
repetition
of
the
experience
that
this
party
has
gone
through
where
it
went
for
decades,
enjoying
ballot
status
and
now
is
denied
that
status.
and
we
believe
that
the
guideline
should
be
that
states
can
regulate
the
accessibility
the
ballot
to
third
parties
but
not
more
than
as
absolutely
necessary
and
if
this
can
be
spelled
out
with
some
greater
clarity
in
precision
and
has
been
before,
this
would
certainly
advance
the
cost
of
participatory
democracy
and
the
rights
of
small
groups
to
participate.
we
have
today
many
small
groups
in
this
society
who
feel
strongly
have
burning
feelings
about
issues
and
are
capable
of
causing
substantial
disruption.
do
we
want
to
channel
the
discontent
and
the
dissent
in
to
the
electoral
process,
i
say
we
do.
but
if
we're
going
to
say
to
those
groups,
yes,
if
you
are
not
satisfied
with
our
institutions
the
way
to
express
your
dissent
to
sue
the
political
parties
but
do
it
through
either
the
democratic
or
republican
party,
we're
not
going
to
channel
the
discontent
through
this
type
because
they're
not
going
to
--
they're
not
going
to
participate
on
that
basis.
they
should
be
encouraged
to
form
the
wrong
political
groups
and
it
should
not
be
prohibitive
and
the
requirement
should
be
minimal
so
that
it's
easy
for
them
to
participate
on
the
political
process.
we
think
this
is
a
very
important
policy
consideration
which
should
inspire
the
court
to
make
the
accessibility
of
the
ballot
easy
and
to
encourage
groups
to
participate
in
this
area.
finally,
we
don't
think
that
this,
what
we
feel
to
be
an
invidious
discrimination
of
the
small
versus
the
large
should
be
dignified
by
excluding
the
socialist
labor
party
from
the
ballot
in
the
november
1968
elections
because
it
would
be
saying
in
effect.
this
has
been
the
main
rational
the
district
court
and
in
this
court's
decision
granting
temporary
injunctive
relief
where
the
point
was
made
there
had
been
some
delay.
what
was
quoted
in
that
order
was
what
the
district
court
had
said
about
the
small
size
of
the
party?
we
would
hope
this
court
would
not
dignify
a
position
which
says
that
the
larger
groups
shall
enjoy
these
rights
but
the
smaller
groups
can
--
mr.
jerry
gordon
yes,
your
honor.
we
did
call
franklin
county.
we
included
that
in
the
brief
we
filed
to
the
court
saturday.
we
were
never
told
that
it
was
impossible.
we
talked
to
vernon
bob
of
the
printing
company
and
he
did
indicate
some
very
large
problems
as
far
as
reprinting
strips
for
voting
machines.
there's
no
question
about
that
and
it
maybe
that
they
wouldn't
have
time
although
he
said,
well,
maybe
some
other
printers
could
do
it
but
then
there's
limitation
--
there's
limited
number
who
can.
but
we
say
this
and
we
make
this
categorical
statement,
there
is
time
to
print
paper
ballots
in
every
county
of
the
state.
there's
no
question
about
that
and
franklin
county
is
elsewhere.
we've
got
plenty
time
before
the
election
to
do
that.
and
if
members
of
this
court
were
prepared
to
make
such
an
order
in
mcdougal
versus
green
which
is
12
days
before
the
election,
certainly
with
twice
that
time
here
there's
time,
cuyahoga
county
has
started
making
its
paper
ballots
for
--
mr.
jerry
gordon
yes.
mr.
jerry
gordon
we
would
say
if
that's
what's
necessary
it
should
be
not.
it's
that
important,
it's
not
important
to
tell
the
people
of
ohio
we
have
seen
these
two
cases
come
up
together
from
the
very
inception
in
our
case
is
the
senior
case.
it's
then
important
to
tell
the
people
of
ohio
that
both
groups
shall
be
given
relief
and
not
one
or
the
other.
we
would
favor
both
groups
on
the
ballot
and
if
there
is
a
certain
disruption
of
the
electoral
process
that's
a
small
price
to
pay
for
democracy.
that's
a
small
price
to
pay
for
--
mr.
jerry
gordon
no.
we
state
in
our
brief
that
if
we
had
waited
--
if
we
sought
relief
now,
obviously
we
wouldn't
expect
much
response
from
the
court.
but
in
view
of
the
fact
that
there
is
time,
no
disruption
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
jerry
gordon
well,
i
would
hope
the
court
would
take
judicial
notice
of
the
fact
that
there
is
time
to
print
ballots
in
29
days
to
print
paper
ballots
in
the
state
of
ohio.
mr.
jerry
gordon
no,
your
honor,
not
the
absentee
ballots.
mr.
jerry
gordon
no,
because
the
absentee
ballots
should
go
out
as
they
are,
there
is
just
not
time
on
those.
that's
--
mr.
jerry
gordon
unless
they
could
write-in.
the
only
ones
that
would
suffer
--
well,
they
could
write-in
and
the
write-in
is
no
big
problem
with
paper
ballots
that's
what
they
will
have.
they
will
be
able
to
write-in
the
names
the
socialist
labor
party
candidates
which
they
can
do
anyway.
mr.
jerry
gordon
your
honor,
we
will
only
win
this
case
if
this
court
take
steps
to
preclude
a
recurrence
of
the
experience
that
we
have
had
in
ohio
where
the
rights
of
these
party
were
obliterated
only
if
guidelines
are
established
that
will
prevent,
that
will
establish
ceilings
on
the
ohio
legislature
because
otherwise
it's
just
as
inevitable
as
it
is
that
day
follows
the
night,
we
will
be
back
in
court
in
1969
again
challenging
the
new
statutes
which
they
passed.
mr.
jerry
gordon
we
say
this
your
honor
that
the
temporary
relief
was
granted
to
the
wallace
group
on
september
10.
we
got
the
order
in
september
11.
we
immediately
notified
and
asked
the
secretary
of
state
to
place
the
socialist
labor
party
candidates
on
the
ballot,
he
declined,
we
notified
him,
we
gave
him
notice
of
the
filing
of
a
motion.
mr.
jerry
gordon
that's
correct
your
honor
but
the
point
is
that
there
is
still
time
and
this
we
think
is
the
crucial
question.
we
recognize
this,
that
this
court
has
to
weigh
the
competing
equities
and
one
thing
it's
going
to
take
in
to
consideration
is
the
state
of
preparation
of
the
printing
of
the
ballots.
we
recognize
that,
all
we're
saying
is
this,
that
the
factors
on
the
other
side
outweigh
this
consideration
and
the
factors
are
these,
that
a
small
group,
the
rights
of
a
small
group
should
be
respected
to
the
same
extent
as
a
large
group
and
as
long
as
it
is
still
possible
for
that
small
group
to
have
a
place
on
the
ballot,
it
should
be
where
the
place
the
ballot
and
this
would
dramatize
by
placing
the
socialist
labor
party
in
the
ballot
it
would
dramatize
the
court's
adherence
to
that
basic
principle.
we
think
the
language
in
the
opinion
which
says
that
when
you
don't
--
when
you
have
to
rely
on
write-in
voting
and
you're
not
on
the
ballot
that
makes
you
a
second
class
elector
and
denies
your
equality
--
mr.
jerry
gordon
well,
that's
correct
your
honor
but
we
have
to
take
--
mr.
jerry
gordon
well,
the
party
didn't
wait
around.
the
documents
that
it
filed
with
this
court
showed
that
year
after
year
it
was
trying
to
get
relief
but
it
didn't
have
the
resources
to
finance
this
type
of
legal
challenge.
the
party
wasn't
waiting
around.
we
have
this
problem
in
our
society
that
people
do
not
assert
their
rights
because
they
are
unable
to.
and
it
was
only
because
the
american
civil
liberties
union
took
this
case
up
that
the
case
is
here
today.
mr.
jerry
gordon
that's
right
and
there
was
admittedly
some
delay.
we
recognize
this
is
a
factor
too
that
the
courts
go
in
a
way.
but
there
are
these
other
factors
which
outweigh
it.
we
think
it
would
be
a
grave
tragedy
if
the
one
party,
the
party
stand
on
the
opposite
ends
of
the
political
spectrum.
we're
not
anticipating
what
this
court
is
going
to
do
we
know
better
than
that
but
we're
just
saying
this
--
we
--
our
position
is
all
party
should
be
on
the
ballot
that
if
the
ballot
is
going
to
be
opened
the
time
to
do
it
is
now,
not
later.
i
don't
want
treat
any
further
this
question
of
whether
we
raise
this
in
the
court
below
because
i
think
we
documented
it
in
the
papers
that
we
filed.
we
agree
that
the
prayer
could've
been
somewhat
clear
but
we
have
documented
in
the
brief,
filed
it
saturday
that
we
certainly
did
request
this
believing
this
relief
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
district
court
did
say
that
the
main
objective
of
both
cases
is
for
valid
status.
we
think
this
question
is
so
important
that
you
cannot
impair
rights
of
small
groups
without
showing
a
compelling
necessity,
it
never
has
been
shown.
therefore,
if
socialist
labor
party
like
the
democrats
or
republicans
should
enjoy
equal
rights
and
if
this
is
an
election
race,
the
race
should
start
at
the
same
place.
thank
you
very
much,
your
honor.
