mr.
young,
you
may
proceed
with
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well
counsel.
glad
to
see
you
mr.
sikes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
can
there
be
any
restrictions
at
all
(inaudible)?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
think
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
has
got
anything
to
do
with
this
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
in
your
brief?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
because
of
statute
was
20
years
old,
it
could've
been
attacked
before
july
29th
of
this
year,
couldn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
about
you're
being
retained
then?
i'm
talking
about
the
people
you
represent.
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
your
clients
make
any
effort
to
comply
with
the
law
other
than
to
go
out
then
they
get
signatures?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
about
the
other
provisions
or
qualifications
such
as
the
hierarchy
of
the
party
in
the
state?
did
you
undertake
to
fulfill
that
application?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
only
question
was
to
whether
that
conforms
to
a
state
bar?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
was
wondering
why
it
couldn't
--
why
you
couldn't
have
gone
in
to
the
court
though
prior
to
the
29th
of
july
to
have
these
matters
determined
so
that
the
state
would
have
ample
time
to
either
conform
to
its
election
laws
or
to
change
them?
chief
justice
earl
warren
when
do
you
conceive
the
first
available
date
was
open
to
you
for
the
suit
that
you
have
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
yes,
anybody.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
they
did
know
at
the
time
didn't
they
that
that
is
in
january
when
they
organized
the
party
that
they
had
no
officers,
they
have
no
officers
that
would
enable
and
to
compile
with
same
law,
they
knew
that,
didn't
they?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
not
what
they
felt.
chief
justice
earl
warren
for
the
law
was
there
--
the
law
was
there
and
you're
attacking
it
now
because
you
couldn't
have
complied
you
say.
well
now,
didn't
they
know
that
in
january
as
well
as
you
know
it
now?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
you
say
they
didn't
--
maybe
they
didn't
read
the
statute
and
i
don't
know
but
if
you
could
know
it
now
they
could've
known
it
in
january,
couldn't
they?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
was
knowable
as
you
say,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
do
you
think
that
they
have
a
right
to
proceed
after
that
without
any
effort
to
meet
that
portion
of
it
or
nor
to
complain
about
it
for
a
matter
of
six
months
until
july
29?
chief
justice
earl
warren
certainly.
but
may
i
--
did
i
understand
you
to
say
that
you
have
tendered
these
petitions
to
the
election
officials
and
they
refused
to
consider
them?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
would
you
state
again
please.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
you
may
have
five
minutes
additional
to
finish
and
counsel
may
have
additional
five
minutes
also.
mr.
lopeman,
you
may
proceed
with
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
1967?
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
you
this,
in
what
sense
do
you
use
the
word
“disaffection”?
disaffection
from
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
it
isn't
necessary
a
disaffection,
is
it?
isn't
it
a
determination
on
their
part
to
have
a
candidate
who
supports
their
views?
we
don't
start
with
the
premise
do
we
that
because
a
man
doesn't
want
to
be
a
republican
or
a
democrat
that
he's
disaffecting,
do
we?
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
you
this
if
you
say
there
--
that
you
think
there
is
no
limitation
upon
the
state
whatsoever
by
reason
of
that
section
of
the
constitution,
would
you
say
that
the
state
of
ohio
could
provide
that
no
one
could
file
in
the
state
except
democrats
for
instance
instead
of
just
saying
nobody
could
file
except
democrats
and
republicans,
could
they
limit
it
to
democrats
if
they
wanted
to
do
it
without
constitutional
invalidity?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
constitutional
command?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it's
equal
protection?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
lopeman,
you
may
continue
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
on
the
question
of
equal
protection,
do
you
make
any
distinction
in
these
two
cases
that
were
hearing
argued
today?
that
is
in
the
result
to
be
achieved
that
one
could
prevail
and
the
other
could
lose?
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
you
don't
concede
that
if
ohio
provides
for
an
elected
process
to
get
on
the
ballot
for
the
presidency
that
that
must
be
in
accordance
with
the
equal
protection?
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
think
the
opposite
--
do
you
say
the
opposite
that
they
are
not
required
to
honor
or
to
equal
protection
if
they
have
an
election?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
couldn't
that
happen
in
any
state,
in
any
state
where
you
had
three
parties?
chief
justice
earl
warren
therefore
you
limit
it
so
that
nobody
but
democrats
and
republicans
can
contend
with
each
other?
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
what
respect?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
was
that
statement
you
say
just
now?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
do
you
mean
because
they
haven't
that
they
should
be
prohibited
from
doing
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
don't
we
rather
face
the
question
as
to
whether
the
state
of
ohio
can
limit
the
elected
process
to
as
between
republicans
and
democrats
alone
without
the
right
of
a
citizen
to
vote
for
anyone
else
but
one
of
those
two
parties?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
why
do
they
do
that?
why
do
they
have
that
right
to
afford
people
the
opportunity
to
vote,
do
they
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
for
the
person
of
their
choice?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
do
they
have
the
right
to
limit
it
to
republicans
and
democrats?
chief
justice
earl
warren
could
they
limit
it
just
to
democrats?
did
they
want
it
too?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
no,
no,
no,
could
they
have
election
as
we
have
here
but
although
we
don't
care
to
have
the
republican's
vote
in
the
state
we'll
limit
it
to
democrats
alone,
could
they
do
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
it
isn't
before
us
but
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
let
me
put
it
this
way
then.
if
they
can
limit
it
to
two
parties,
why
can't
they
limit
it
to
one?
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
lopeman,
will
you
tell
me
please
what
the
petitioner
should
have
done
in
order
to
comply
with
your
law
prior
of
the
time
he
brought
this
action
on
the
29th
of
july
but
did
not
do?
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
list
them
please.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
young.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
disapprove
that,
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
was
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
are
they
obliged
to
vote
for
wallace?
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
can
vote
for
mr.
“x”
and
mr.
griffin
if
they
wanted?
chief
justice
earl
warren
as
a
matter
of
law
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
that's
what
we're
talking
about?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
certainly.

well,

et

appellants

et

mr.
spirer
(ph).
chief
justice
earl
warren
motion
is
granted.
mr.
gordon,
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
suppose
there
are
hundreds
of
times
as
many
members
in
the
armed
forces
overseas
so
you
have
members
to
your
party,
aren't
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
must
have
thousands,
many
thousands
of
members
of
the
armed
forces
overseas,
are
you
going
to
deprive
them
of
their
vote
or
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
they
got
it
now,
didn't
they?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
can't
all
of
the
vote,
vote
with
the
same
facility?
chief
justice
earl
warren
don't
you
have
that
same
inequality
in
all
write-ins,
for
all
officers
in
your
state
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
there's
a
place
there
i
suppose
for
write-in,
for
all
officers
and
don't
they
have
the
exactly
the
same
inequality?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
have
five
minutes
more
too
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
mr.
gordon.
mr.
lopeman.
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
was
not
raised
at
all
in
the
court
below?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
gordon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
to
get
them
over
to
get
them?
chief
justice
earl
warren
or
get
them
back
in
time
to
be
counted
as
absentee
ballots?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
then
all
these
thousands
of
veterans
would
be
disfranchised
in
the
situation
unless
they've
followed
another
procedure
from
the
one
that's
in
the
existence
in
ohio?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
well,
let
me
ask
you
this
mr.
gordon,
you
have
two
prongs
to
your
case.
one
of
them
is
that
these
statutes
are
unconstitutional;
the
other
is
that
you
want
some
temporary
relief.
now,
if
the
court
should
determine
that
these
statutes
are
unconstitutional
but
that
it's
too
late
to
afford
you
the
remedy
that
you
asked
for,
wouldn't
you
win
this
case?
wouldn't
major
source
of
your
argument
be
satisfied
and
wouldn't
you
win
to
all
practical
purposes?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
that
is
no
matter
how
late
you
come
to
this
court
you
had
20
years
that
you
could've
test
to
this
if
you
wanted
to
as
a
national
party
because
you
have
been
a
national
party
for
20
years
but
you
think
that
regardless
of
the
exigencies
of
the
situation
that
you
can
come
in
just
as
late
as
you
want
and
without
regard
to
the
disruption
of
the
election
process
you
can
say
to
us
in
order
to
do
your
duty,
you
have
to
give
us
temporary
relief.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
that
isn't
final,
we
didn't
say
that
that
was
going
to
be
on
that.
that
was
a
temporary
relief
that
can
be
changed
by
the
judgment
of
this
court?

opposite
--
do
you
say
the
opposite
that
they
are
not
required
to
honor
or
to
equal
protection
if
they
have
an
election?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
couldn't
that
happen
in
any
state,
in
any
state
where
you
had
three
parties?
chief
justice
earl
warren
therefore
you
limit
it
so
that
nobody
but
democrats
and
republicans
can
contend
with
each
other?
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
what
respect?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
was
that
statement
you
say
just
now?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
do
you
mean
because
they
haven't
that
they
should
be
prohibited
from
doing
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
don't
we
rather
face
the
question
as
to
whether
the
state
of
ohio
can
limit
the
elected
process
to
as
between
republicans
and
democrats
alone
without
the
right
of
a
citizen
to
vote
for
anyone
else
but
one
of
those
two
parties?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
why
do
they
do
that?
why
do
they
have
that
right
to
afford
people
the
opportunity
to
vote,
do
they
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
for
the
person
of
their
choice?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
do
they
have
the
right
to
limit
it
to
republicans
and
democrats?
chief
justice
earl
warren
could
they
limit
it
just
to
democrats?
did
they
want
it
too?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
no,
no,
no,
could
they
have
election
as
we
have
here
but
although
we
don't
care
to
have
the
republican's
vote
in
the
state
we'll
limit
it
to
democrats
alone,
could
they
do
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
it
isn't
before
us
but
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
let
me
put
it
this
way
then.
if
they
can
limit
it
to
two
parties,
why
can't
they
limit
it
to
one?
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
lopeman,
will
you
tell
me
please
what
the
petitioner
should
have
done
in
order
to
comply
with
your
law
prior
of
the
time
he
brought
this
action
on
the
29th
of
july
but
did
not
do?
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
list
them
please.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
young.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
disapprove
that,
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
was
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
are
they
obliged
to
vote
for
wallace?
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
can
vote
for
mr.
“x”
and
mr.
griffin
if
they
wanted?
chief
justice
earl
warren
as
a
matter
of
law
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
that's
what
we're
talking
about?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
certainly.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well,
number
544,
socialist
labor
party
et
al.,
appellants
versus
james
a.
rhodes,
et
al.
mr.
spirer
(ph).
chief
justice
earl
warren
motion
is
granted.
mr.
gordon,
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
suppose
there
are
hundreds
of
times
as
many
members
in
the
armed
forces
overseas
so
you
have
members
to
your
party,
aren't
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
must
have
thousands,
many
thousands
of
members
of
the
armed
forces
overseas,
are
you
going
to
deprive
them
of
their
vote
or
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
they
got
it
now,
didn't
they?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
can't
all
of
the
vote,
vote
with
the
same
facility?
chief
justice
earl
warren
don't
you
have
that
same
inequality
in
all
write-ins,
for
all
officers
in
your
state
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
there's
a
place
there
i
suppose
for
write-in,
for
all
officers
and
don't
they
have
the
exactly
the
same
inequality?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
have
five
minutes
more
too
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
mr.
gordon.
mr.
lopeman.
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
was
not
raised
at
all
in
the
court
below?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
gordon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
to
get
them
over
to
get
them?
chief
justice
earl
warren
or
get
them
back
in
time
to
be
counted
as
absentee
ballots?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
then
all
these
thousands
of
veterans
would
be
disfranchised
in
the
situation
unless
they've
followed
another
procedure
from
the
one
that's
in
the
existence
in
ohio?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
well,
let
me
ask
you
this
mr.
gordon,
you
have
two
prongs
to
your
case.
one
of
them
is
that
these
statutes
are
unconstitutional;
the
other
is
that
you
want
some
temporary
relief.
now,
if
the
court
should
determine
that
these
statutes
are
unconstitutional
but
that
it's
too
late
to
afford
you
the
remedy
that
you
asked
for,
wouldn't
you
win
this
case?
wouldn't
major
source
of
your
argument
be
satisfied
and
wouldn't
you
win
to
all
practical
purposes?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
that
is
no
matter
how
late
you
come
to
this
court
you
had
20
years
that
you
could've
test
to
this
if
you
wanted
to
as
a
national
party
because
you
have
been
a
national
party
for
20
years
but
you
think
that
regardless
of
the
exigencies
of
the
situation
that
you
can
come
in
just
as
late
as
you
want
and
without
regard
to
the
disruption
of
the
election
process
you
can
say
to
us
in
order
to
do
your
duty,
you
have
to
give
us
temporary
relief.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
that
isn't
final,
we
didn't
say
that
that
was
going
to
be
on
that.
that
was
a
temporary
relief
that
can
be
changed
by
the
judgment
of
this
court?
