justice
abe
fortas
well,
isn't
that
--
do
you
really
want
to
rest
on
the
argument
that
you
just
elaborated
based
on
katzenbach
against
morgan?
i
thought
your
argument
was
that
if
the
state
chooses
in
effect
to
delegate
this
power
to
the
electorate
it
must
then
do
it
on
the
basis
which
preserves
equal
protection
rights
to
all
voters
that
is
to
say
that
you
once
have
to
take
the
step
of
a
state
choosing
who
vest
this
constitutional
apart
which
i
read
as
my
brother
stewart
does
but
once
a
state
chooses
to
vest
that
in
the
voters
it
has
to
provide
that
the
right
should
be
available
to
be
exercised
by
the
voters
on
that
basis
of
equality.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
we
were
kind
of
off
and
left
field
then
weren't
we?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
young,
assuming
the
unconstitutionality
of
the
ohio
statute
for
whatever
reason,
the
question
of
relief
here
i
suppose
is
clearly
and
obviously
difficult
to
an
important
one,
are
you
familiar
in
a
general
way
with
the
socialist
labor
parties
petition
before
us?
justice
abe
fortas
is
there
--
would
you
say
that
there's
any
distinction
between
the
relief
that
should
be
granted
in
those
two
cases
assuming
the
unconstitutionality
of
the
ohio
statute
and
also
assuming
the
facts
of
life
with
which
we're
confronted?
justice
abe
fortas
but
i'm
trying
to
get
at
the
theory
of
this
and
this
it
seems
to
me
to
be
the
quickest
way
to
do
it.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
understand
that
but
we're
faced
with
the
practical
situation
here
and
i
notice
what
i
must
say
a
bit
of
surprise
that
in
your
paper
you
asked
us
to
direct
the
ohio
legislature
to
formulate
some
sort
of
requirements
that
would
be
lawful
and
constitutional.
do
you
really
mean
that
that
this
court
should
direct
the
ohio
legislature
to
do
that?
i
believe
that
appears
in
your
reply
brief.
and
would
you
--
and
is
that
the
way
you
would
as
practical
matter
make
the
distinction
between
your
case
and
the
socialist
labor
party
case?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that's
not
what
i'm
asking
you,
you
phrase
it
in
anyway
you
want
to.
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
asking
you
how
we
go
about
in
making
a
distinction
between
those.
let's
assume
that
socialist
labor
party
has
200
members
all
told
something
like
that,
it's
been
suggested,
and
you've
got
all
these
members
hundreds
of
thousands
of
them
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
theory,
the
function
of
this
court
could
we
make
a
distinction
and
it's
so
held
or
what
is
it
that
you're
asking
us
merely
to
say
to
ohio
that
its
statute
is
unconstitutional
because
it
is
discriminatory
against
so-called
independent
parties
and
independent
candidates.
and
therefore,
it
must
grant
relief
and
that
--
and
the
relief
ordered
is
not
the
relief
order
to
be
ordered
by
the
--
this
court
is
not
the
relief
order
merely
ordered
by
the
lower
court
which
is
a
write-in
but
that
the
names
of
the
both
parties
must
be
printed
on
the
ballot.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
you
think
--
do
you
think
that
the
court
should
make
a
judgment
as
to
whether
the
number
of
signatures
on
your
petition
are
appropriate
for
equitable
relief,
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
abe
fortas
and
you
don't
press
your
suggestion
then
that
we
instruct
the
--
that
we
direct
the
ohio
legislature
that
we
direct
this
court,
direct
the
ohio
legislature
to
enact
the
--
an
appropriate
and
constitutional
law?
justice
abe
fortas
you
mean
you
think
we
have
that
power
and
could
properly
exercise
power
to
direct
the
ohio
legislature
to
do
that?
justice
abe
fortas
that's
not
my
proposition,
it's
yours.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
lopeman,
as
i
understand
your
adversary's
position
and
maybe
i'm
wrong
about
this,
it
is
that
nobody
can
comply
with
this
ohio
statute.
let
us
say
no
third
party
or
independent
party
or
independent
party
candidate
can
comply
with
it
regardless
of
when
the
party
starts
since
were.
now,
has
anybody
ever
complied
with
it,
has
there
ever
been
a
third
party
or
third
--
or
an
independent
candidate
for
president
on
the
ohio
ballot
since
the
adoption
in
this
statute?
justice
abe
fortas
and
is
it
--
do
you
concede
that
as
a
practical
matter
it
would
be
impossible
to
comply
and
do
you
say
that
nevertheless
the
ohio
statute
is
defensible,
is
that
your
position?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
so
let
me
see
if
i
clearly
understand
this
now.
your
position
is
that
even
if
it
were
impossible
to
comply
to
get
a
third
party
or
an
independent
candidate
on
the
ballot,
it's
ohio's
position
that
ohio
is
still
constitutionally
justified
in
imposing
such
prohibition,
but
that
you
also
argue
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
is
possible
to
comply
with
the
requirements
of
the
ohio
statute,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
the
lower
court
found
to
the
contrary,
did
it
not?
lower
court
found
that
there
could
not
be
compliance
with
the
ohio
statute
or
do
i
misread
the
opinion?
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
not
entirely
clear
on
it
myself
and
i
wondered
if
--
and
you
say
that
you
don't
know
whether
there
is
a
specific
finding
to
that
effect.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
lopeman,
is
there
a
distinction
between
the
right
of
a
candidate
to
appear
on
the
ballot,
have
his
name
appear
on
the
ballot
and
the
right
of
a
political
party?
now,
there
is
in
the
ohio
election
law
as
i
read
it,
there
are
elaborate
requirements
for
a
party
to
appear
--
to
get
its
name
on
the
ballot
as
to
have
a
primary
and
so
on.
and
it
has
seem
to
me
perhaps
to
be
arguable
that
there
is
a
reasonable
distinction
between
what
a
state
may
do
with
respect
to
requiring
a
political
party
to
qualify
on
the
one
hand
and
allowing
an
individual
candidate
to
qualify
on
the
other
hand.
for
example,
when
the
other
case
is
before
us
a
california
--
a
california
case
i
noticed
that
they
have
separate
procedures
for
qualifying
a
candidate
you
say,
he
can
be
placed
on
the
ballot
by
receiving
a
certain
number
and
a
relatively
modest
number
as
i
recall
it
of
a
signatures
but
a
political
party
for
a
political
party
in
california
has
more
onerous
requirements.
now,
the
order
that
has
been
in
or
pending
final
decision
in
this
case
provides
that
ohio
shall
show
--
enter
on
its
ballot.
both
the
american
name
of
the
american
independent
party
and
the
name
of
mr.
wallace
and
his
vice
presidential
candidate
would
point
to
them
asking
about
is
whether
the
--
it
is
or
you
would
make
any
argument
to
the
effect
that
the
ohio
requirements
are
certainly
valid
and
reasonable
with
respect
to
a
political
party,
do
you
see
even
though
we
might
conclude
that
they
are
not
reasonable
and
constitutional
with
respect
to
the
qualification
of
an
individual
as
a
candidate
or
his
electors?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
understand
that
argument
but
on
the
other
hand
if
you
assume
that
the
state's
power
has
to
be
exercised
reasonably.
i
know
you
don't
make
that
assumption
in
one
leg
of
your
argument.
but
if
we
should
arrive
at
the
conclusion
that
the
state's
power
has
to
be
exercised
reasonably,
is
it
possible
to
say
that
the
--
on
analysis
of
the
ohio
law
is
that
state
is
exercising
its
power
reasonably
with
respect
to
a
political
party
but
arguably
not
reasonably
with
respect
to
the
candidate?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
young,
who
is
the
vice
presidential
candidate
of
the
american
independent
party
in
ohio?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
no,
no.
now,
please
this
is
question
that
goes
to
the
issue
before
us.
you're
asking
this
court
in
effect
to
order
that
the
name
of
mr.
griffin
be
placed
on
the
ballot
as
a
candidate
for
the
office
of
vice
president
of
the
united
states.
justice
abe
fortas
and
may
i
suggest
to
you
therefore
that
i
want
to
know,
who
is
the
candidate
for
the
office
of
vice
president
of
the
united
states
of
the
american
independent
party
in
ohio?
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that
but
i'm
asking
you
whether
he
is
the
candidate
of
the
american
independent
party
and
if
he
is,
if
your
answer
to
that
is
yes,
then
i
want
to
know
two
things;
does
the
record
show
how
he
was
selected,
number
one.
number
two,
will
the
effect
of
this
court's
order
mean
that
if
the
voters
of
ohio
vote
for
the
american
independent
parties
ticket
that
the
electors
will
vote,
will
pass
their
ballot
for
mr.
wallace
and
mr.
griffin?
justice
abe
fortas
now
you
and
your
adversary
just
arrived
diametrically
opposite
conclusions
on
that
question?
justice
abe
fortas
and
someone
was
his
--
justice
abe
fortas
--co-counsel?
justice
abe
fortas
wasn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
alright,
now,
next
--
may
i
get
to
my
next
question
if
you
care
to.
as
to
say,
if
this
court
orders
that
the
american
independent
party
appeared
on
the
ballot
and
the
names
of
mr.
wallace
and
mr.
griffin
appear
on
the
ballot.
what
will
be
the
effect
of
this
court's
order
in
the
event
that
the
people
of
ohio
cast
their
votes
for
give
that
ticket
a
plurality
of
their
votes?
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
asking
a
question
of
law,
i'm
not
interested
in
the
politics
in
this
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i'm
asking
you,
what
the
legal
effect
will
be.
will
the
legal
effect
be
that
the
electors
will
have
to
cast
their
vote
for
mr.
griffin
as
vice
president?
justice
abe
fortas
or
will
they
not?
justice
abe
fortas
and
you're
saying
that
legally
they
will
be
free
to
vote,
to
cast
their
vote
for
someone
else
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
as
vice
president?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
is
mr.
griffin,
the
candidate
in
whatever
sense
you
want
to
put
it
at
the
present
time
of
the
american
independent
party
of
ohio.
justice
abe
fortas
in
any
sense
whatever.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
griffin
originally
selected
before
you
started
it
lawful?
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
you.
what
is
--
what
would
be
effect
of
a
final
order,
why
do
you
make
a
distinction
between
a
temporary
and
the
final
order
here?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
do
you
mean
to
say
that
if
we
rule
on
the
merits
here
and
your
opinion
will
be
deciding
something
about
the
--
well,
will
have
to
be
deciding
constitutionality
of
the
ohio
statute
as
applied
in
this
case
or
generally
in
either
event,
wouldn't
we?
justice
abe
fortas
and
what
you're
saying
is
that
one
would
be
an
interim
order
and
the
other
would
be
a
final
order
but
we
would
not
in
any
case
be
adjudicating
whether
there
is
such
a
thing
as
the
american
independent
party
as
a
formal
ohio
party
under
ohio
laws
for
future
purposes,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
these
people,
the
american
independent
party
will
have
to
certify
at
least
some
electors,
won't
it?
assuming
that
they
go
into
ballot,
won't
they
have
to
certify
a
list
of
electors?
justice
abe
fortas
and
then
will
those
electors
have
to
take
the
same
oath
as
the
electors
selected
pursuant
to
file
the
democratic
or
republican
parties?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
do
you
have
to
--
do
you
rest
on
that
extreme
position
and
used
that
without
(inaudible),
do
you
rest
on
that?
is
that
your
only
position
or
do
you
also
argue
that
assuming
that
the
state
of
ohio
could
make
reasonable
regulations
and
reasonable
classifications
to
define
a
--
what
is
a
political
party
to
require
in
minimum
amount
of
signatures.
it
has
not
done
so
in
this
instance
and
therefore,
since
it
has
not
done
so
in
this
instance,
is
it
your
argument?
you
are
--
you
should
--
this
court
should
so
declare
and
should
order
that
you
got
a
place
on
the
ballot
because
the
write-in
position
ordered
by
the
lower
court
is
not
adequate.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
do
you
have
to
take
the
extreme
position
for
which
you've
been
arguing
or
do
you
reach
the
same
result
by
law
in
the
lines
that
i've
just
suggested
to
you?
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that
--
excuse
me
sir,
i'm
just
--
i'm
trying
to
--
what
i'm
trying
to
get
from
is
your
view
as
to
this
point,
suppose
that
we
don't
go
along
with
the
--
what
i've
called
the
extreme
position,
suppose
that
we
take
the
position
however
that
lower
court
was
right
in
saying
that
the
ohio
law
is
unconstitutional
because
although
ohio
could
make
reasonable
regulations
and
set
up
reasonable
classifications,
these
are
not
reasonable,
do
you
see?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
would
that
--
would
it
or
would
it
not,
or
would
that
or
would
it
not
suffice
for
your
purposes?
justice
abe
fortas
alright,
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
get
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
and
in
other
words,
your
position
would
be
that
since
by
my
assumption
the
statutes
unconstitutional
this
court
should
not
then
say
that
100
members
of
the
political
party
is
not
enough
but
we
should
then
say
that
in
all
of
parties
before
us
are
entitled
to
relief,
is
that
your
argument?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
gordon,
forgive
me
for
taking
another
moment
of
your
time
but
did
you
represent
to
us
that
cuyahoga
county
that's
cleveland,
isn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
has
printed
ballot
with
the
socialist
party
name
on
it
and
your
candidates
on
its
subject
to
this
court's
decision?
justice
abe
fortas
can
you
tell
us
that?
justice
abe
fortas
i
see.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
lopeman
excuse
me,
i
understood
in
the
previous
case,
the
wallace
case
that
your
position
was
that
the
statutes
in
the
ohio
procedures
were
lawful
and
constitutional.
justice
abe
fortas
now,
here
ago,
you're
asking
us
to
affirm
the
decision
below
but
he
had
too
the
district
court
held
that
the
ohio
procedures
were
unlawful
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
or
unconstitutional.
justice
abe
fortas
we
can
affirm
the
order
without
affirming
the
reason
for
it,
can
we?
i
don't
understand
your
position.
if
we
affirm
the
order
of
the
district
court
and
the
socialist
labor
party
case,
doesn't
that
mean
that
we
concur
with
the
view
that
with
the
conclusion
that
the
ohio
statute
procedures
are
unlawful
which
means
unconstitutional
because
the
district
court
gave
the
party
relief.
it
was
the
relief
of
a
write-in
requiring
that
there
be
a
write-in.
they're
asking
for
additional
relief
now.
but
how
--
is
it
your
position
that
we
can
affirm
the
district
court
without
concurring
in
the
conclusion
that
the
ohio
statute
and
procedures
are
unlawful?
justice
abe
fortas
i
know,
but
the
district
court
granted
relief
here.
district
court
ordered
that
the
space
be
provided
on
the
ohio
ballot
for
a
write-in
for
the
socialist
labor
party
and
its
candidates,
am
i
right
about
that?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
isn't
that
--
do
you
really
want
to
rest
on
the
argument
that
you
just
elaborated
based
on
katzenbach
against
morgan?
i
thought
your
argument
was
that
if
the
state
chooses
in
effect
to
delegate
this
power
to
the
electorate
it
must
then
do
it
on
the
basis
which
preserves
equal
protection
rights
to
all
voters
that
is
to
say
that
you
once
have
to
take
the
step
of
a
state
choosing
who
vest
this
constitutional
apart
which
i
read
as
my
brother
stewart
does
but
once
a
state
chooses
to
vest
that
in
the
voters
it
has
to
provide
that
the
right
should
be
available
to
be
exercised
by
the
voters
on
that
basis
of
equality.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
we
were
kind
of
off
and
left
field
then
weren't
we?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
young,
assuming
the
unconstitutionality
of
the
ohio
statute
for
whatever
reason,
the
question
of
relief
here
i
suppose
is
clearly
and
obviously
difficult
to
an
important
one,
are
you
familiar
in
a
general
way
with
the
socialist
labor
parties
petition
before
us?
justice
abe
fortas
is
there
--
would
you
say
that
there's
any
distinction
between
the
relief
that
should
be
granted
in
those
two
cases
assuming
the
unconstitutionality
of
the
ohio
statute
and
also
assuming
the
facts
of
life
with
which
we're
confronted?
justice
abe
fortas
but
i'm
trying
to
get
at
the
theory
of
this
and
this
it
seems
to
me
to
be
the
quickest
way
to
do
it.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
understand
that
but
we're
faced
with
the
practical
situation
here
and
i
notice
what
i
must
say
a
bit
of
surprise
that
in
your
paper
you
asked
us
to
direct
the
ohio
legislature
to
formulate
some
sort
of
requirements
that
would
be
lawful
and
constitutional.
do
you
really
mean
that
that
this
court
should
direct
the
ohio
legislature
to
do
that?
i
believe
that
appears
in
your
reply
brief.
and
would
you
--
and
is
that
the
way
you
would
as
practical
matter
make
the
distinction
between
your
case
and
the
socialist
labor
party
case?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that's
not
what
i'm
asking
you,
you
phrase
it
in
anyway
you
want
to.
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
asking
you
how
we
go
about
in
making
a
distinction
between
those.
let's
assume
that
socialist
labor
party
has
200
members
all
told
something
like
that,
it's
been
suggested,
and
you've
got
all
these
members
hundreds
of
thousands
of
them
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
theory,
the
function
of
this
court
could
we
make
a
distinction
and
it's
so
held
or
what
is
it
that
you're
asking
us
merely
to
say
to
ohio
that
its
statute
is
unconstitutional
because
it
is
discriminatory
against
so-called
independent
parties
and
independent
candidates.
and
therefore,
it
must
grant
relief
and
that
--
and
the
relief
ordered
is
not
the
relief
order
to
be
ordered
by
the
--
this
court
is
not
the
relief
order
merely
ordered
by
the
lower
court
which
is
a
write-in
but
that
the
names
of
the
both
parties
must
be
printed
on
the
ballot.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
you
think
--
do
you
think
that
the
court
should
make
a
judgment
as
to
whether
the
number
of
signatures
on
your
petition
are
appropriate
for
equitable
relief,
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
abe
fortas
and
you
don't
press
your
suggestion
then
that
we
instruct
the
--
that
we
direct
the
ohio
legislature
that
we
direct
this
court,
direct
the
ohio
legislature
to
enact
the
--
an
appropriate
and
constitutional
law?
justice
abe
fortas
you
mean
you
think
we
have
that
power
and
could
properly
exercise
power
to
direct
the
ohio
legislature
to
do
that?
justice
abe
fortas
that's
not
my
proposition,
it's
yours.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
lopeman,
as
i
understand
your
adversary's
position
and
maybe
i'm
wrong
about
this,
it
is
that
nobody
can
comply
with
this
ohio
statute.
let
us
say
no
third
party
or
independent
party
or
independent
party
candidate
can
comply
with
it
regardless
of
when
the
party
starts
since
were.
now,
has
anybody
ever
complied
with
it,
has
there
ever
been
a
third
party
or
third
--
or
an
independent
candidate
for
president
on
the
ohio
ballot
since
the
adoption
in
this
statute?
justice
abe
fortas
and
is
it
--
do
you
concede
that
as
a
practical
matter
it
would
be
impossible
to
comply
and
do
you
say
that
nevertheless
the
ohio
statute
is
defensible,
is
that
your
position?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
so
let
me
see
if
i
clearly
understand
this
now.
your
position
is
that
even
if
it
were
impossible
to
comply
to
get
a
third
party
or
an
independent
candidate
on
the
ballot,
it's
ohio's
position
that
ohio
is
still
constitutionally
justified
in
imposing
such
prohibition,
but
that
you
also
argue
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
is
possible
to
comply
with
the
requirements
of
the
ohio
statute,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
the
lower
court
found
to
the
contrary,
did
it
not?
lower
court
found
that
there
could
not
be
compliance
with
the
ohio
statute
or
do
i
misread
the
opinion?
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
not
entirely
clear
on
it
myself
and
i
wondered
if
--
and
you
say
that
you
don't
know
whether
there
is
a
specific
finding
to
that
effect.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
lopeman,
is
there
a
distinction
between
the
right
of
a
candidate
to
appear
on
the
ballot,
have
his
name
appear
on
the
ballot
and
the
right
of
a
political
party?
now,
there
is
in
the
ohio
election
law
as
i
read
it,
there
are
elaborate
requirements
for
a
party
to
appear
--
to
get
its
name
on
the
ballot
as
to
have
a
primary
and
so
on.
and
it
has
seem
to
me
perhaps
to
be
arguable
that
there
is
a
reasonable
distinction
between
what
a
state
may
do
with
respect
to
requiring
a
political
party
to
qualify
on
the
one
hand
and
allowing
an
individual
candidate
to
qualify
on
the
other
hand.
for
example,
when
the
other
case
is
before
us
a
california
--
a
california
case
i
noticed
that
they
have
separate
procedures
for
qualifying
a
candidate
you
say,
he
can
be
placed
on
the
ballot
by
receiving
a
certain
number
and
a
relatively
modest
number
as
i
recall
it
of
a
signatures
but
a
political
party
for
a
political
party
in
california
has
more
onerous
requirements.
now,
the
order
that
has
been
in
or
pending
final
decision
in
this
case
provides
that
ohio
shall
show
--
enter
on
its
ballot.
both
the
american
name
of
the
american
independent
party
and
the
name
of
mr.
wallace
and
his
vice
presidential
candidate
would
point
to
them
asking
about
is
whether
the
--
it
is
or
you
would
make
any
argument
to
the
effect
that
the
ohio
requirements
are
certainly
valid
and
reasonable
with
respect
to
a
political
party,
do
you
see
even
though
we
might
conclude
that
they
are
not
reasonable
and
constitutional
with
respect
to
the
qualification
of
an
individual
as
a
candidate
or
his
electors?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
understand
that
argument
but
on
the
other
hand
if
you
assume
that
the
state's
power
has
to
be
exercised
reasonably.
i
know
you
don't
make
that
assumption
in
one
leg
of
your
argument.
but
if
we
should
arrive
at
the
conclusion
that
the
state's
power
has
to
be
exercised
reasonably,
is
it
possible
to
say
that
the
--
on
analysis
of
the
ohio
law
is
that
state
is
exercising
its
power
reasonably
with
respect
to
a
political
party
but
arguably
not
reasonably
with
respect
to
the
candidate?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
young,
who
is
the
vice
presidential
candidate
of
the
american
independent
party
in
ohio?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
no,
no.
now,
please
this
is
question
that
goes
to
the
issue
before
us.
you're
asking
this
court
in
effect
to
order
that
the
name
of
mr.
griffin
be
placed
on
the
ballot
as
a
candidate
for
the
office
of
vice
president
of
the
united
states.
justice
abe
fortas
and
may
i
suggest
to
you
therefore
that
i
want
to
know,
who
is
the
candidate
for
the
office
of
vice
president
of
the
united
states
of
the
american
independent
party
in
ohio?
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that
but
i'm
asking
you
whether
he
is
the
candidate
of
the
american
independent
party
and
if
he
is,
if
your
answer
to
that
is
yes,
then
i
want
to
know
two
things;
does
the
record
show
how
he
was
selected,
number
one.
number
two,
will
the
effect
of
this
court's
order
mean
that
if
the
voters
of
ohio
vote
for
the
american
independent
parties
ticket
that
the
electors
will
vote,
will
pass
their
ballot
for
mr.
wallace
and
mr.
griffin?
justice
abe
fortas
now
you
and
your
adversary
just
arrived
diametrically
opposite
conclusions
on
that
question?
justice
abe
fortas
and
someone
was
his
--
justice
abe
fortas
--co-counsel?
justice
abe
fortas
wasn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
alright,
now,
next
--
may
i
get
to
my
next
question
if
you
care
to.
as
to
say,
if
this
court
orders
that
the
american
independent
party
appeared
on
the
ballot
and
the
names
of
mr.
wallace
and
mr.
griffin
appear
on
the
ballot.
what
will
be
the
effect
of
this
court's
order
in
the
event
that
the
people
of
ohio
cast
their
votes
for
give
that
ticket
a
plurality
of
their
votes?
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
asking
a
question
of
law,
i'm
not
interested
in
the
politics
in
this
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i'm
asking
you,
what
the
legal
effect
will
be.
will
the
legal
effect
be
that
the
electors
will
have
to
cast
their
vote
for
mr.
griffin
as
vice
president?
justice
abe
fortas
or
will
they
not?
justice
abe
fortas
and
you're
saying
that
legally
they
will
be
free
to
vote,
to
cast
their
vote
for
someone
else
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
as
vice
president?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
is
mr.
griffin,
the
candidate
in
whatever
sense
you
want
to
put
it
at
the
present
time
of
the
american
independent
party
of
ohio.
justice
abe
fortas
in
any
sense
whatever.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
griffin
originally
selected
before
you
started
it
lawful?
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
you.
what
is
--
what
would
be
effect
of
a
final
order,
why
do
you
make
a
distinction
between
a
temporary
and
the
final
order
here?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
do
you
mean
to
say
that
if
we
rule
on
the
merits
here
and
your
opinion
will
be
deciding
something
about
the
--
well,
will
have
to
be
deciding
constitutionality
of
the
ohio
statute
as
applied
in
this
case
or
generally
in
either
event,
wouldn't
we?
justice
abe
fortas
and
what
you're
saying
is
that
one
would
be
an
interim
order
and
the
other
would
be
a
final
order
but
we
would
not
in
any
case
be
adjudicating
whether
there
is
such
a
thing
as
the
american
independent
party
as
a
formal
ohio
party
under
ohio
laws
for
future
purposes,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
these
people,
the
american
independent
party
will
have
to
certify
at
least
some
electors,
won't
it?
assuming
that
they
go
into
ballot,
won't
they
have
to
certify
a
list
of
electors?
justice
abe
fortas
and
then
will
those
electors
have
to
take
the
same
oath
as
the
electors
selected
pursuant
to
file
the
democratic
or
republican
parties?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
do
you
have
to
--
do
you
rest
on
that
extreme
position
and
used
that
without
(inaudible),
do
you
rest
on
that?
is
that
your
only
position
or
do
you
also
argue
that
assuming
that
the
state
of
ohio
could
make
reasonable
regulations
and
reasonable
classifications
to
define
a
--
what
is
a
political
party
to
require
in
minimum
amount
of
signatures.
it
has
not
done
so
in
this
instance
and
therefore,
since
it
has
not
done
so
in
this
instance,
is
it
your
argument?
you
are
--
you
should
--
this
court
should
so
declare
and
should
order
that
you
got
a
place
on
the
ballot
because
the
write-in
position
ordered
by
the
lower
court
is
not
adequate.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
do
you
have
to
take
the
extreme
position
for
which
you've
been
arguing
or
do
you
reach
the
same
result
by
law
in
the
lines
that
i've
just
suggested
to
you?
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that
--
excuse
me
sir,
i'm
just
--
i'm
trying
to
--
what
i'm
trying
to
get
from
is
your
view
as
to
this
point,
suppose
that
we
don't
go
along
with
the
--
what
i've
called
the
extreme
position,
suppose
that
we
take
the
position
however
that
lower
court
was
right
in
saying
that
the
ohio
law
is
unconstitutional
because
although
ohio
could
make
reasonable
regulations
and
set
up
reasonable
classifications,
these
are
not
reasonable,
do
you
see?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
would
that
--
would
it
or
would
it
not,
or
would
that
or
would
it
not
suffice
for
your
purposes?
justice
abe
fortas
alright,
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
get
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
and
in
other
words,
your
position
would
be
that
since
by
my
assumption
the
statutes
unconstitutional
this
court
should
not
then
say
that
100
members
of
the
political
party
is
not
enough
but
we
should
then
say
that
in
all
of
parties
before
us
are
entitled
to
relief,
is
that
your
argument?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
gordon,
forgive
me
for
taking
another
moment
of
your
time
but
did
you
represent
to
us
that
cuyahoga
county
that's
cleveland,
isn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
has
printed
ballot
with
the
socialist
party
name
on
it
and
your
candidates
on
its
subject
to
this
court's
decision?
justice
abe
fortas
can
you
tell
us
that?
justice
abe
fortas
i
see.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
lopeman
excuse
me,
i
understood
in
the
previous
case,
the
wallace
case
that
your
position
was
that
the
statutes
in
the
ohio
procedures
were
lawful
and
constitutional.
justice
abe
fortas
now,
here
ago,
you're
asking
us
to
affirm
the
decision
below
but
he
had
too
the
district
court
held
that
the
ohio
procedures
were
unlawful
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
or
unconstitutional.
justice
abe
fortas
we
can
affirm
the
order
without
affirming
the
reason
for
it,
can
we?
i
don't
understand
your
position.
if
we
affirm
the
order
of
the
district
court
and
the
socialist
labor
party
case,
doesn't
that
mean
that
we
concur
with
the
view
that
with
the
conclusion
that
the
ohio
statute
procedures
are
unlawful
which
means
unconstitutional
because
the
district
court
gave
the
party
relief.
it
was
the
relief
of
a
write-in
requiring
that
there
be
a
write-in.
they're
asking
for
additional
relief
now.
but
how
--
is
it
your
position
that
we
can
affirm
the
district
court
without
concurring
in
the
conclusion
that
the
ohio
statute
and
procedures
are
unlawful?
justice
abe
fortas
i
know,
but
the
district
court
granted
relief
here.
district
court
ordered
that
the
space
be
provided
on
the
ohio
ballot
for
a
write-in
for
the
socialist
labor
party
and
its
candidates,
am
i
right
about
that?
