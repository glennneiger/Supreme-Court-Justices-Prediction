justice
hugo
l.
black
what
point
do
you
cite
them
on?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you,
if
the
state
takes
a
position
that
it
is
now
impossible
or
would
interfere
or
interrupt
to
regular
elected
process
to
grant
the
relief
which
these
people
asked?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
what
i
want
to
know
is
just
that,
limiting
to
the
question
whether
it
is
now
practicable
and
reasonable
for
the
state
to
permit
the
voters
to
consider
this
party
along
with
the
others.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
that
that
question
is
not
to
bother
us
one
way
or
the
other?
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
defend
the
act
if
it
said
60%?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
isn't
that
if
we
have
a
right
to
any
of
it,
that
is
the
question
of
equal
protection,
the
question
of
balancing
equity
as
to
see
whether
they
have
disturbed
or
setup
too
much,
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
why
wouldn't
the
legislative
--
a
judicial
question?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
it
said
they
can
have
election
by
another
party
who
had
95
--
they
get
95%
of
the
people
on
the
petition.
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
you
would
say
that
equal
protection
does
--
the
clause
does
apply?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
say
the
state
has
absolute
right
to
appoint
who
the
legislature
and
has
the
absolute
right
to
say
that
there
shall
only
be
two
parties
in
the
state?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
that's
what
i
mean.
that's
right,
that
is
the
extent
of
your
argument,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
on
this
point?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
don't
have
to
have
it,
didn't
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
couldn't
be
punished
by
anyone?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
can
carry
out
that
binding
stipulation?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
do
you
say
party
has
only
108
voters?
justice
hugo
l.
black
aren't
the
many
county
states
have
more
than
108
counties?
justice
hugo
l.
black
aren't
the
many
states
that
have
more
counties
of
108?
justice
hugo
l.
black
counties?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
say
this
--
is
it
your
position
federal
constitution
bars
the
state
for
admitting
the
group
has
only
108
members
going
to
the
trouble
and
expense
of
putting
them
on
the
ticket
in
every
county
in
the
state?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
i
understand
that
your
position
is
exact
opposite
--
your
position
is
exact
opposite
of
the
state
it
takes
the
position
they
have
an
absolute
right
to
bar
for
any
reason
at
all,
a
minority
party.
you
take
the
position
if
minority
party
has
an
absolute
constitutional
right
to
be
put
on
the
ballot
even
when
it
has
only
108
members.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
if
there's
only
five
members?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
should
there
be
any
if
you
have
an
absolute
right?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
exactly
what
you
have?
you
have
a
specific
constitutional
provision
against
discriminating
on
a
count
of
race.
you
do
not
have
it
on
what
you
have
here,
you're
going
on
to
throw
a
general
protection,
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
he's
not
the
one
we
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
construe?
justice
hugo
l.
black
can
they
vote
in
ohio?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
have
to
write-in?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
claim
that
the
state
doesn't
have
the
right
to
say
that
such
a
small
group,
hundred,
how
many
population
in
ohio?
justice
hugo
l.
black
about
3
million
there's
only
a
hundred
that
is
treating
them
or
denying
them
the
equal
protection
not
to
put
them
on
the
ballot
if
you
put
all
the
others
i'm
talking
about.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
talking
about
having
been
on
the
ballot.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
except
the
general
provision
of
the
equal
protection
clause
has
to
be
treated
some
way
practically,
we
cannot
construe
it
because
it's
never
been
construed
which
means
each
particular
class
has
to
have
exact
the
same
treatment
under
all
of
circumstances
but
you
do
claim
that
application
here.
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
could
you
do
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
they
haven't
waived
it,
are
you
claiming
now
the
right
to
waive
for
other
people
aren't
you
or
other
people
i
understood
to
decide
particular
numbers
of
your
party?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
you
say
37
--
did
you
refer
to
3715
of
the
code?
justice
hugo
l.
black
3705.01?
justice
hugo
l.
black
3517.01.
now,
what
does
that
do?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
then
the
other
statute
is
one
which
authorizes
of
group
of
people
to
become
known
as
a
political
party
if
they
get
15%
of
the
voters?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
why
i
said
that's
this
one?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
is
that
the
same
one
as
the
10%?
justice
hugo
l.
black
all
part
of
one
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
point
do
you
cite
them
on?
justice
