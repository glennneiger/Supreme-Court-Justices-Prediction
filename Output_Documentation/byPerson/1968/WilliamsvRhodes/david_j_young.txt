mr.
david
j.
young
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court,
mr.
lopeman,
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
outset
i
would
like
to
introduce
mr.
stan
sikes,
an
attorney
admitted
to
the
bar
of
alabama
whose
associated
with
me
in
this
case.
mr.
david
j.
young
first
of
all,
the
appellants
would
like
to
express
their
appreciation
to
the
court
for
the
dispatch
and
vigilance
with
which
they
have
scheduled
this
case,
the
case
that
may
very
well
need
additional
remedial
relief
to
protect
the
most
basic
of
all
of
our
rights
in
society,
the
right
to
vote.
we
recognized
that
this
has
been
an
inconvenience
to
the
court
but
we
are
grateful
that
we
have
scheduled
the
case
so
expeditiously.
we
place
this
case
before
the
court
in
urging
fashion
because
we
believe
that
the
integrity
of
the
1968
presidential
election
is
at
stake.
we
believe
that
the
transcript
evidence
before
the
court
amply
demonstrates
that
plaintiff's
candidate
governor
wallace
has
sufficient
voter
support
in
ohio
that
his
chances
of
carrying
that
state
are
very
substantial.
we
--
the
transcript
evidence
shows
polls
that
were
taken
and
they
were
placed
before
the
lower
court
and
each
of
the
answers
to
those
polls
was
prefaced
on
the
condition
that
if
governor
wallace's
name
appears
on
the
ballot
they
would
vote
for
him.
on
the
other
hand,
it
would
appear
to
us
and
from
the
evidence
in
the
transcript
that
if
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
are
relegated
to
the
federal
court
relief
of
write-in
status,
this
governor
wallace's
name
is
taken
off
the
ballot
in
ohio
that
his
supporters
in
that
state
might
as
well
forget
about
those
26
electoral
votes.
thus,
we
appear
before
the
court
today
seeking
relief
that's
not
only
essential
to
the
protection
of
the
equal
protection
of
the
law
rights
of
the
voters
in
ohio
of
the
candidates
of
the
minor
political
parties
but
also
a
protection
of
the
integrity
of
this
presidential
election
and
an
order
which
will
convince
at
least
452,000
voters
in
ohio
that
they
cannot
be
fenced
out
of
the
democratic
elective
process
simply
because
their
views
do
not
agree
with
the
views
of
the
majority
party.
mr.
david
j.
young
there
they
have
not.
we
tendered
them
to
the
election
officials.
they
did
not
care
to
review
them
at
the
time
they
were
placed
before
the
district
court
--
lower
district
court,
they
were
placed
before
them
as
the
transcript
indicates
by
certified
public
accountant.
now,
of
course
he
would
not
have
verified
some
of
the
things
that
he
couldn't
verify.
the
petitions
that
were
before
the
lower
court
are
not
required
by
ohio
law
to
be
registered
voters.
therefore,
the
only
verification
that
would
be
necessary
would
be
the
age
and
the
residence
in
the
state
of
ohio.
the
duplications
were
called
out.
mr.
david
j.
young
that
is
correct.
mr.
david
j.
young
under
ohio
law,
we
have
an
ohio
statute
and
we
have
that
for
many
years
that
states
that
a
vote
for
a
presidential
candidate
whose
name
appears
on
the
ballot
is
considered
as
a
vote
for
the
electors'
pledge
to
him
who
have
been
certified
by
that
candidate
or
party
to
the
secretary
of
state.
the
order
of
the
lower
court
then
provided
that
a
right
hand
vote
for
a
presidential
candidate
would
be
considered
as
a
vote
for
the
electors
certified
to
the
secretary
of
state.
mr.
david
j.
young
no,
in
this
case
have
until
october
the
15th
to
accomplish
that
certification.
mr.
david
j.
young
we
did
not.
mr.
david
j.
young
we
did
not
seek.
mr.
david
j.
young
no,
i
do
think
that
the
write-in
does
protect
certain
fundamental
constitutional
rights
when
the
--
mr.
david
j.
young
not
and
of
itself,
no
and
perhaps
i
might
get
ahead
of
myself
and
explain
why.
i
think
that
a
very
significant
aspect
of
the
inadequacy
of
the
relief
afforded
by
the
lower
court
in
this
case
is
demonstrated
when
one
reviews
the
election
laws
in
ohio
and
their
relationship
to
the
methods
of
write-in
voting.
in
ohio,
we
have
an
excess
of
13,000
precincts
of
with
polling
places.
the
elections
of
such
are
governed
by
the
88
counties
in
the
state.
each
clerk
of
the
board
of
elections
then
and
that
board
of
elections
selects
the
voting
method
that
he
feels
would
best
suit
his
county's
conditions.
now,
the
problem
is
that
there
are
five
different
voting
methods
scattered
throughout
the
state
of
ohio
in
this
88
counties
and
13,000
precincts
may
review
them
just
real
quickly.
first
of
all,
the
basic
paper
ballot
and
of
course
the
difficulties
of
a
write-in,
statewide
write-in
campaign
aren't
too
great
with
that
ballot
because
that
simply
has
an
extra
space
and
rather
than
checking
the
space
with
the
name
on
it;
one
writes
in
the
name
in
the
extra
space
and
then
checks
it.
moving
from
there
however,
we
move
to
what
we
call
the
synthesized
paper
ballot
that
is
used
in
the
county
--
hamilton
county
with
the
third
largest
country
in
the
state
of
ohio
with
city
of
cincinnati
in
that
county.
they
used
a
synthesized
ballot
the
record
shows.
it's
a
punch
card
that
has
four
holes
on
the
pointers
of
that
synthesized
ballot.
in
order
to
--
now,
the
reason
i
have
those
are
these
are
counted
at
the
secretary
of
state's
office.
they
are
transported
to
the
secretary
of
state
put
on
the
machine
and
they
push
a
button
and
just
all
go
down
to
the
machine
and
the
synthesized
votes
are
recorded.
now,
when
a
voter
in
ohio
would
approach
the
booth
to
use
that
kind
of
a
voting
device,
he
would
be
given
a
cigar
or
lighter
kind
of
apparatus
that
he
would
stamp
his
choice
for
the
name
of
the
candidates.
and
on
this
stamp
makes
the
marking
that's
recorded
in
this
machine.
if
he
wanted
to
write
in,
he
couldn't
use
this
apparatus.
it
writes
too
large.
there
would
be
pencils
available.
now,
if
you
pick
up
the
pencil
first
and
started
to
write
in,
there's
no
written
instructions
in
the
booth
or
on
the
card
to
show
that
the
pencil
would
not
record
any
of
the
votes
for
all
of
the
other
candidates.
so,
if
he
--
he
couldn't
use
the
cigar
lighter-kind
of
apparatus
to
write
in,
he
couldn't
use
the
pencil
to
mark
the
other
ones.
the
only
way
of
voter
in
ohio
in
this
election
would
know
what
to
do
would
have
to
be
asked
the
voting
officials.
so,
this
is
going
to
--
and
then
of
course
they'll
have
to
call
out
all
of
the
synthesized
cards
with
any
writing
on
them
and
count
them
twice.
from
those
two
methods,
we
move
to
the
three
voting
machine
methods.
the
first
one
as
the
record
demonstrates
is
the
shupe
(ph)
method
which
probably
is
the
easiest
to
use
in
write-in
situations.
it
is
the
voting
machine
that
has
the
offices
listed
vertically
in
to
the
left
and
then
the
candidates
to
the
right.
it's
quite
simple
to
use
the
write-in
process
in
those
because
the
little
door
that
you
lift
up
to
find
the
paper
is
just
to
the
left
of
the
office.
and
so
you
just
go
over
then
write-in
but
the
more
frequently
used
automatic
voting
machine
has
its
candidates
and
officers
horizontally
across
the
top
and
it
has
a
little
box
some
place
else
where
you
have
to
lift
up
doors
to
find
the
place
to
vote.
you
have
to
correlate
a
number
that's
attributed
to
a
specific
office
and
go
up
some
place
else
on
the
machine
and
lift
up
a
door
that
relates
to
that
number
and
then
write-in
your
vote.
for
this
particular
year,
there's
a
major
problem
the
little
slants
where
you
write-in
slant
in
this
direction
for
a
right
hand
voter
and
a
left
handed
voter
would
almost
have
to
stand
on
his
head
to
get
up
and
write-in
on
that
space.
mr.
david
j.
young
yes.
mr.
david
j.
young
yes.
mr.
david
j.
young
yes.
mr.
david
j.
young
not
in
this
case.
the
final
voting
apparatus
that
i
would
discuss
is
the
coil
voting
machine.
this
will
present
the
problems
also
because
it
hasn't
--
it's
really
a
tabulating
machine
as
the
record
shows.
a
voter
picks
up
an
ibm
card,
this
is
later
counted
by
an
ibm
machine
and
he
puts
this
ibm
card
into
this
tabulating
--
into
this
marking
apparatus,
a
glass
plate
fits
over
it
and
it
magnifies
the
markings
on
this
ballot
and
then
you
go
through
and
turn
the
card
around
and
then
when
you
get
to
the
office
that
you
want
to
vote
for
you
punch
it
and
it
makes
a
mark
on
the
ballot.
in
order
to
write-in,
you
have
to
get
that
card
out
of
the
machine
and
get
it
back
down
and
write.
now,
i
would
be
pretty
simple
to
most
people
but
i
think
a
lot
of
people
might
not
realize
how
they're
going
to
write
with
that
card
inside
the
magnified
apparatus.
mr.
david
j.
young
yes,
and
i
think
down
south
in
one
of
the
other
counties
that
maybe
sam
can
tell
us
later
on.
i
think
that's
down
the
southern
counties
in
ohio.
what
i
think
that
an
explanation
of
these
five
different
kinds
of
voting
devices
suggest
if
the
other
frustration
of
trying
to
mount
a
statewide
voter
education
campaign
of
how
you're
going
to
go
in
and
exercise
the
write-in
right
to
vote.
it
would
be
extremely
difficult
for
some
people
even
to
accomplish
it
in
many
voters
with
many
of
the
apparatus
would
have
to
discuss
this
with
the
voting
officials
and
reveal
in
essence
who
they're
seeking
to
vote
for
when
they're
trying
to
determine
how
to
use
this
write-in
device
on
these
machines.
the
record
before
the
court
indicates
that
governor
wallace's
supporters
have
obtained
ballot
position
for
him
in
all
49
states.
he
has
been
certified
in
a
49
states
now
and
of
course
if
we
include
the
temporary
order
this
would
be
50
states.
but
for
this
litigation
and
that's
why
it
was
broad
this
year,
in
the
presidential
election
ohio
would
--
could
shamefully
alone
is
the
only
state
in
the
country
denying
ballot
position
to
a
presidential
candidate
who
could
demonstrate
sufficient
voter
support
to
satisfy
any
reasonable
any
qualification
requirement
--
ballot
position
requirement
established
by
any
state.
we've
demonstrated
to
the
court.
we
hope
that
ohio's
election
laws
are
more
harsh
and
more
discriminatory
as
they
relate
to
the
independent
and
third
party
candidate
and
voter
than
any
other
state
in
the
country.
mr.
sikes
was
doing
some
computations
for
me.
when
we
look
through
the
voting
laws
in
all
47
states
where
some
form
of
a
signature
petition
was
used,
the
three
others
--
there
were
three
states.
one
of
them
the
convention
which
used
alabama
(voice
overlap)
--
the
total
requirement
in
district
of
ohio
(inaudible)
were
signature
petitions
were
used.
the
total
requirement
and
this
included
ohio
of
signatures
was
1,052,867.
when
you
subtract
ohio's
requirement
from
this,
433,100
it
takes
619,000
signatures
using
our
methods
to
get
on
the
ballot
in
46
states
and
433,100
a
pretty
close
to
that
i
figured
just
to
get
on
the
ballot
on
the
state
of
ohio
and
after
you
get
those
signatures
before
the
secretary
of
state
you
still
can't
get
on
the
ballot
and
we
hope
to
demonstrate
that
later
on.
just
the
15%
requirement
that
we'll
be
talking
about
is
75
times
higher
than
the
percentage
requirement
in
the
state
of
new
york.
30
times
higher
then
the
ballot
position
requirements
in
each
of
the
average
of
the
each
of
the
five
states
bordering
on
the
state
of
ohio.
mr.
david
j.
young
which
point
is
that
mr.
justice
white?
mr.
david
j.
young
it
would
be
helpful
but
it
seems
to
me
that
even
if
the
15%
requirement
were
held
to
be
constitutional.
there
are
several
other
aspects
of
ohio's
voting
laws
which
would
demonstrate
their
violation
of
the
protection
of
equal
protection
laws.
mr.
david
j.
young
let's
assume
they
were
not?
mr.
david
j.
young
if
unfortunately,
once
you
get
the
15%
you're
nowhere
in
the
state
of
ohio.
mr.
david
j.
young
on
--
it
didn't
know
what
you
say
by
in
time
justice
white.
mr.
david
j.
young
there
is
no
statute
in
the
state
of
ohio
that
requires
the
15%
to
be
in
it
any
time
other
than
90
days
before
an
election.
mr.
david
j.
young
now,
the
sec
--
mr.
david
j.
young
yes,
but
perhaps
i
should
explain
why
the
argument
is
improperly
so
that
in
order
to
get
on
the
ballot
as
a
presidential
candidate
you
would
have
to
have
delegates
to
a
national
convention
elected
a
primary.
mr.
david
j.
young
yes.
mr.
david
j.
young
i
don't
--
i
wouldn't
agree
because
here
again
i
think
the
mere
denial,
the
first
attempt,
was
an
independent
nominating
petition.
the
mere
fact
that
that
is
denied
was
taken
away
from
voters
in
the
state
of
ohio
in
1948
in
and
of
itself
would
justify
relief
in
this
case,
it
seems
to
me
even
if
--
mr.
david
j.
young
yes,
if
they
said
that
we
must
go
through
a
political
party
process
then
we
would
have
to
show
that
the
15%
is
unconstitutional.
i'm
satisfied
that
we
can
show
that
to
this
court
but
--
mr.
david
j.
young
that's
correct.
now,
we
do
not
suggest
to
the
court
however
that
because
we
could
get
the
15%
that
it's
not
a
overwhelmingly
prohibitive
requirement,
if
he
must
have
some
reasonable
relationship
to
a
permissible
state
policy.
mr.
david
j.
young
yes,
although,
we
would
hope
to
convince
the
court
that
the
timing
is
not
the
significant
factor
but
rather
that
no
matter
when
if
we
would've
file
those
petitions
five
years
ahead
of
time,
five
years
before
this
election
we
still
couldn't
got
known
the
ballot
because
there
are
so
many
other
pitfalls
for
the
new
party
that
that
15%
wouldn't
have
done
as
a
bit
of
good.
we
still
couldn't
have
got
on
the
ballot.
mr.
david
j.
young
that's
correct.
that's
correct
and
the
15%
timing
is
only
significant
insofar
as
it
relates
to
those
other
provisions
because
if
those
other
provisions
didn't
exist
we
wouldn't
have
to
worry
about
--
mr.
david
j.
young
now,
i'm
not
making
myself
clear
justice
white
because
the
ohio
could
not
have
said
that.
the
law
says,
the
petition
must
be
in
90
days
before
the
election.
now,
if
you
knockout
those
other
laws,
there
would
be
no
requirement
that
it
be
in
on
february
the
7th,
august
the
7th
would
be
perfectly
satisfactory.
there
is
no
statute
in
the
state
of
ohio
that
requires
the
15%
to
be
in
90
days
before
the
primary.
that
only
comes
about
if
you
uphold
the
other
party
primary
provisions
which
would
be
prohibitive
against
this
party.
if
you
threw
those
statutes
out,
the
15%,
90
days
before
the
general
election
would
be
satisfactory
under
ohio
law.
i
know
it's
very
complicated
but
this
comes
about
by
an
interrelated
reading
of
this
statute
with
the
political
primary
statute.
it's
only
by
inference
from
the
primary
statutes
that
we
get
this
necessity
of
filing
90
days
before
the
primary.
one
could
read
the
laws
i
suggest
the
average
lawyer
for
50
hours
and
he
would
never
realize
that
that
petition
had
to
be
in
90
days
with
a
primary
because
there's
--
unless
you
understand
every
single
election
statute
you
don't
get
to
that
result.
mr.
david
j.
young
no,
it
would
mean
that
election
first
in
some
instances.
let's
say
we
were
not
attempting
to
qualify
a
presidential
candidate
or
some
other
kind
of
candidate
then
that
word
“election”
would
not
mean
primary.
it
could
mean
general
election,
it
could
me
primary,
it
could
mean
special
depending
on
what
use
you
were
trying
to
make
of
the
15%.
mr.
david
j.
young
yes,
we
concede
in
this
case
in
order
to
get
on
the
ballot
if
they
weren't
all
these
other
unconstitutional
statutes
we
would've
had
to
file
on
february
7,
1968.
yes,
no
question
about
that.
the
state
of
ohio
throughout
this
case
and
in
its
briefs
that
are
before
the
court
at
the
present
time
have
conceded
the
motivation,
the
reason
for
the
adoption
of
the
key
statutes
that
we're
concerned
about
in
this
case.
as
to
the
legislation,
amendments
that
occurred
during
--
back
in
1948
to
1952
which
completely
eliminated
the
right
of
nomination
of
independent
candidates.
they
have
stated
that
independent
candidacy
is
an
evil.
and
then
they
explain
it's
an
evil
because
people
end
up
voting
for
someone
they
really
shouldn't
vote
for.
and
that
these
statutes
back
in
1948-1952
were
designed
to
stamp
out
that
evil
to
wit
independent
candidacy.
as
to
the
political
party
laws,
the
state
of
ohio
states
that
it
is
a
legitimate
purpose
to
prevent
third
party
candidates
or
third
parties
from
interfering
with
the
chances
of
the
two
major
party
candidates
to
get
a
clear
cut
victory
in
election.
we
concede
those
motivations
also
and
we
do
not
believe
that
they
withstand
the
requirements
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
we
do
not
believe
that
these
are
legitimate
or
permissible
state
policies.
mr.
david
j.
young
yes
and
that's
why
i
started
out.
mr.
david
j.
young
yes,
justice
stewart.
mr.
david
j.
young
when
i
read
that
section
of
the
united
states
constitution
i
note
that
it
provides
that
a
state
may
appoint
--
mr.
david
j.
young
shall
appoint.
mr.
david
j.
young
that's
correct.
shall
appoint
its
presidential
electors,
our
constitutional
history
tells
us
that
subsequent
to
about
the
1870's
that
no
state
has
appointed
its
presidential
electors
by
the
legislative
body
doing
so
but
rather
they
have
appointed
their
presidential
electors
by
either
--
by
one
form
or
another
of
letting
the
electorate
vote
for
them.
so,
when
i
read
that
section,
i
do
note
that
the
state
could
appoint
but
when
i
read
it
in
conjunction
with
what
the
--
this
supreme
court
has
stated
for
example
in
the
harper
case
that
once
a
state
exercises
a
constitutional
power
by
delegating
that
two
the
voters
in
the
state
that
that
delegation
must
comply
with
the
requirements
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
constitution
of
united
states.
mr.
david
j.
young
i
--
i'm
just
probably
so
but
as
i
read
this
court's
decisions
i'm
not
100%
--
mr.
david
j.
young
certainly,
but
pardon
me
--
mr.
david
j.
young
that's
certainly
correct.
now,
i
did
not
include
in
my
reply
brief
but
on
the
day
that
i
had
to
file
it
i
called
opposing
counsel
and
noted
that
with
reference
to
that
argument
i
should've
cited
one
case
by
this
court
which
i
feel
comes
closes
to
answering
that
particular
contention
and
i
gave
the
citation
to
counsel
last
friday
and
that's
the
case
of
katzenbach
versus
morgan.
the
court
will
recall
this
was
the
new
york
case
where
the
state
of
new
york
was
attempting
to
uphold
its
literary
test
--
literacy
test
requirement
as
a
qualification
to
voting
and
as
against
the
federal
legislation
the
voting
rights
act
which
stated
that
if
one
attended
puerto
rican
schools
and
went
to
sixth
grade
and
wasn't
taught
english
that
they
could
not
be
barred
from
voting.
now,
one
of
the
arguments
presented
in
that
case
was
the
fact
that
the
state
of
new
york
by
reason
of
direct
constitutional
grant,
united
states
constitutional
grant
had
the
power
to
establish
qualifications
of
voters
in
election
for
united
states
--
members
of
the
united
states
house
of
representative
and
united
states
senators.
so
in
another
words,
in
this
instance,
the
state
like
a
state
would
be
doing
it
if
we're
appointing
electors
was
doing
exactly
what
the
united
states
constitution
told
it
to
do.
and
i
have
this
real
brief
little
quote
here
that
i
think
comes
very
close
to
answering
this
requirement.
it
starts
up
by
recognizing
under
the
distribution
of
powers
affected
by
the
constitution.
the
state
established
qualifications
for
voting
for
state
officers
and
the
qualifications
established
by
the
states
for
voting
for
members
of
the
most
numerous
branch
of
the
state
legislature
also
determined
who
may
vote
for
united
states
representatives
and
senators
and
then
cites
some
authorities.
but
of
course,
the
states
have
no
power
to
grant
or
withhold
the
franchise
on
conditions
that
are
forbidden
by
the
fourteenth
amendment
or
any
other
provisions
of
the
constitution.
such
exercises
of
state
power
are
no
more
immune
to
the
limitations
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
than
any
other
state
action.
now,
as
i
read
that
this
court
is
saying
that
regardless
of
the
source
of
whether
the
state
is
regulating
the
qualifications
simply
by
reason
of
the
reserved
powers
in
the
state
in
the
constitution
or
because
of
some
constitutional
grant
of
authority
like
they
were
doing
in
the
katzenbach
case
but
still
that
the
restraints
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
still
apply.
mr.
david
j.
young
yes.
mr.
david
j.
young
those
are
differences
i
don't
see
the
distinction
the
same
as
you
do
justice
stewart
but
certainly
they
are
differences.
it
seems
to
me
that
that
section
that
you
are
referring
to
however
does
not
go
on
and
say,
the
state
shall
appoint
in
such
manners
it
will
direct
without
regard
to
the
protections
of
such
and
such
and
such
and
such.
mr.
david
j.
young
before
the
fourteenth
amendment?
mr.
david
j.
young
i
don't
think
we
would
have.
mr.
david
j.
young
i'm
not
sure
that
that
would
--
we
would
have
to
say
modification
because
i
don't
read
that
original
provision
is
saying
in
such
manners
they
shall
direct
discriminatory
or
otherwise
and
no
case
of
this
court
has
ever
held
to
my
knowledge
that
simply
because
of
that
provision
that
once
the
state
went
forward
with
their
appointment
and
appointed
by
way
of
delegation
to
the
electorate,
they
could
do
it
a
discriminatory
fashion.
the
old
case
that
we
cited
by
our
opponents
mcpherson
versus
blacker,
it
seems
to
me
even
in
that
case
which
yes
it
was
after
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
david
j.
young
went
on
and
indicated
that
there
was
no
discrimination
alleged
in
that
case.
mr.
david
j.
young
that
is
precisely
our
position
if
i
need
plenty
other
answers
suggested
that
was
otherwise
then
i
hope
you
disregard
it,
that
is
precisely
our
position
in
this
case.
mr.
david
j.
young
well,
--
mr.
david
j.
young
and
once
we
conceded
that
after
the
state
begins
delegating
to
the
voters
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
protections
apply,
that
seems
to
me
that
kind
of
delegation
clearly
must
fall
because
there
would
not
be
a
legitimate
and
permissible
state
policy
to
limit
presidential
candidates
or
presidential
electors
only
to
those
who
in
here
to
the
beliefs
of
the
republican
or
democratic
parties.
so,
it
would
be
my
(voice
overlap).
mr.
david
j.
young
i
feel
that
would
be
blatant
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
just
as
much
as
they
said,
you
must
choose
between
jewish
and
catholic
--
members
of
the
jewish
and
catholic
religious
faith.
i
don
think
there's
any
justifiable,
permissible
basis
for
establishing
such
distinctions
and
i
think
that
such
a
delegation
would
fall
and
should
fall.
mr.
david
j.
young
any
restrictions,
we
do
concede,
yes.
we
think
that
the
state
has
indicated
by
this
court
in
many,
many
cases
the
carrington
case
and
others
that
it
is
--
the
state
has
performed
the
historic
function
of
protecting
the
ballot,
protecting
the
integrity
of
its
elections,
making
sure
that
citizen's
right
to
vote
was
really
meaningful
and
they
had
proper
methods
for
voting
accuracy
and
all
the
rest.
so,
we
do
feel
that
a
state
made
a
place
of
restrictions
on
all
of
these
items
but
that
in
order
to
prevail
and
in
order
to
withstand
constitutional
challenge
that
these
must
be
reasonably
or
rationally
related
to
a
permissible
state
purpose.
i
think
that
in
the
case
at
bar
--
in
the
case
at
bar,
counsel
and
the
state
of
ohio
has
said
what
their
purpose
in
one
of
the
statute
says.
their
purpose
is
to
stamp
out
independent
candidacy.
now,
the
statutes
they
adopted
was
rationally
related
to
that
first
purpose.
but
it
seems
to
me
the
second
half
of
the
proposition
fails
that
that
purpose
is
not
a
permissible
state
purpose.
so,
that
would
not
--
these
are
not
--
mr.
david
j.
young
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
united
states
constitution.
mr.
david
j.
young
that
which
demands
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws.
mr.
david
j.
young
as
i
have
framed
the
case,
i
have
placed
it
upon
the
equal
protection
clause.
mr.
david
j.
young
i
have
not
come
up
with
a
theory
that
would
put
it
into
the
due
process
category.
it
seems
to
us
that
the
equal
protection
clause
was
so
applicable
here.
mr.
david
j.
young
the
first
amendment
is
significant,
it's
not
a
significant
to
ballot
position
but
it
is
significant
in
this
whole
area
because
of
the
free
speech
right
and
any
--
it
seems
to
us
any
legislation
that
prevents
organization
in
free
participation
of
minority
parties
in
the
political
spectrum
interstate
can
if
the
regulations
are
not
reasonably
related
to
a
permissible
state
policy
and
it
isn't
permissible
just
to
discriminate
against
them,
it's
got
yet
some
other
reason.
that
in
that
instance
if
it
denied
participation
which
our
laws
do
in
ohio
then
it
seems
to
me
where
impairing
a
free
speech
rights
too.
mr.
david
j.
young
so
do
we
and
we
ask
why
we
based
the
right
to
organize.
mr.
david
j.
young
it
would
seem
to
us
that
the
first
amendment
has
brought
in
through
the
fourteenth
permits
the
right
to
--
mr.
david
j.
young
the
due
process?
okay.
gives
us
the
right
to
organize
but
we
want
to
go
further
than
just
organize
and
just
participate.
it
seems
to
me
that
what
we
really
need
in
this
instance
is
ballot
position
and
the
reason
we
aren't
getting
ballot
position
is
because
of
a
--
laws
that
are
discriminatory
that
do
not
provide
equal
protection
of
the
laws
and
that's
why
we
have
based
it
but
certainly
this
analysis
would
suggest
that
perhaps
we
could've
place
some
more
emphasize
on
the
due
process
clause.
i
concede
that.
mr.
david
j.
young
yes,
justice
fortas.
mr.
david
j.
young
yes.
i
do
see
it,
it's
a
very
substantial
distinction
when
i
explain
it,
i
want
to
make
it
perfectly
clear
that
we
have
no
objection
to
the
socialist
labor
party
appearing
on
the
ballot.
mr.
david
j.
young
once
we
start
out
with
the
proposition
recognizing
because
of
the
state
historic
function
in
controlling
its
procedures
that
it
can
come
up
with
some
reasonable
regulation
related
to
a
legitimate
policy.
it
seems
to
us
if
we
accept
that
proposition
that
the
state
could
establish
some
reasonable
requirements
preliminary
to
obtaining
ballot
position
practically
every
state
in
the
country
does
this.
now,
if
it's
a
number
requirement,
it
has
to
be
the
size
of
the
number
has
to
be
carefully
scrutinized
to
make
certain
that
the
true
purpose
and
effect
isn't
just
discrimination
rather
than
making
certain
that
we
don't
have
--
i
mean
we
couldn't
let
every
citizen
have
his
name
on
the
ballot.
mr.
david
j.
young
perhaps
the
way
you've
asked
the
question
i
would
direct
them
that
if
they
are
to
be
requirements
that
they'll
be
reasonable
requirements
--
mr.
david
j.
young
yes,
i
do
think
so.
mr.
david
j.
young
it
seems
to
us
that
when
one
brings
a
case
like
this
before
the
court,
he
must
need
two
objectives.
first
of
all,
demonstrate
the
unconstitutionality
of
the
legislation
as
being
challenged.
and
secondly,
demonstrate
by
reason
of
principles
of
equity
that
the
court
should
grant
equitable
relief.
now,
if
a
party
came
before
the
three-judge
district
court
in
ohio
and
said,
we
have
one
member
and
we
don't
want
any
more
members
and
then
one
came
in
with
450,000
signatories
on
a
petition.
it
seems
to
us
that
a
court
of
equity
could
make
a
distinction
on
these
grounds
as
justice
--
judge
kinneary
did
in
this
case.
his
distinction
was
that
this
party
has
demonstrated
that
it
has
sufficient
voter
straight
can
be
any
constitutionally
permissible
number
figure.
he
did
not
find
that
the
other
party
had
demonstrated
that
it
could
meet
constitutionally
permissible
standards.
then,
the
court
of
equity
must
decide
and
take
it
the
clearer
case
the
one
man
party
in
the
450,000
is
at
state
law
that
kept
this
one
man
party
off
the
ballot
or
is
it
just
the
mere
fact
that
they
aren't
large
enough
to
be
on
the
ballot.
so,
it
seems
to
me
that
once
you
concede
reasonable
number's
regulations
then
it
seems
to
me
you
get
to
the
proposition
that
in
plaintiffs
coming
before
court
of
equity
and
asking
equitable
relief
that
a
judge
will
look
to
their
strength
and
to
see
whether
the
laws
themselves
or
would
kept
this
party
off
the
ballot.
mr.
david
j.
young
that
is
certainly
something
that
this
court
would
consider.
i
would
assume
that
the
facts
in
the
case
and
whether
they
have
shown
to
the
court
that
equitable
relief
is
appropriate
and
i
think
the
numbers
are
--
is
probably
the
one
of
the
biggest
factors
in
this
case
452,000
signatures.
mr.
david
j.
young
i
have
no
misgivings
about
this
court
directing
the
ohio
general
assembly
to
adhere
to
the
united
states
constitution
in
this
case
anymore
than
in
the
redistricting
cases,
or
malapportionment
cases
or
many
other
cases.
mr.
david
j.
young
i
have
no
quarrel
with
that
proposition.
mr.
david
j.
young
if
it's
mine
then
i
champion
it.
mr.
david
j.
young
well,
in
effect,
it
seems
to
me
in
the
apportionment
cases,
this
court
or
upon
remand
the
lower
courts
the
court
have
said
that
no
election
may
go
forward
until
you
--
reapportion
your
areas
of
some
elections
have
been
voided
by
federal
court
cases,
are
set
aside
because
there
was
not
properly
apportioned
and
it
seems
to
me
that
it
was
always
conditioned
--
mr.
david
j.
young
well,
perhaps
then
and
that's
exactly
what
i'm
saying.
i'm
not
playing
upon
how
this
court
or
any
other
federal
court
causes
the
--
a
particular
state
legislature
to
accomplish
this.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
this
court
were
to
say
to
the
ohio
general
assembly
that
unless
you
revise
your
laws
to
permit
reasonable
participation
by
independent
and
third
party
candidates
that
there
can
be
no
elections
under
those
laws.
this
in
effect
is
directing
the
state
of
ohio
to
revise
its
laws.
this
is
really
what
i'm
saying
and
perhaps
i
should've
given
that
answer
to
justice
fortas.
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
as
much
direction
as
any
other
form
of
direction.
and
with
the
ohio
legislative
service
commission,
these
are
laws
that
were
adopted
back
in
1948.
there's
no
question
in
my
mind
right
now
that
upon
proper
order
of
the
ohio
general
assembly
would
be
delighted
to
bring
its
laws
up-to-date
like
the
laws
of
every
other
state.
mr.
david
j.
young
not,
not
by
our
law
firm
your
honor.
we
were
retained
on
july
23,
1968.
mr.
david
j.
young
well,
this
puts
in
a
rather
funny
position
when
we
were
in
the
lower
court
we
had
two
situations.
we
had
two
cases,
one
group
of
plaintiffs
attacked
the
law
right
away
back
in
january
of
1968
without
trying
to
get
petitions.
and
they
were
met
with
the
argument,
hey,
you
should've
going
out
and
try
to
get
petitions
before
you
came
in
to
court.
now,
on
the
other
hand,
we
went
out
and
got
petitions
and
came
in
the
court
and
they
said,
you
should've
filed
your
lawsuit
earlier
so
no
matter
which
way
we
went,
the
state
of
ohio,
i
think
--
mr.
david
j.
young
no,
pardon
me.
in
these
laws,
we
have
two
lawsuits,
the
socialist
labor
and
the
wallace
case.
mr.
david
j.
young
the
socialist
labor
case
was
filed
in
january
of
1968.
and
ours
was
filed
on
july
29,
1968.
so,
we
have
the
two
extremes
that
one
situation
of
a
lawsuit
having
been
filed
early
and
one
in
july
29,
so
it
seems
to
us
that
there
certainly
was
adequate
notice
and
time
to
defend
in
this
case.
mr.
david
j.
young
when
the
time
for
filing
this
lawsuit
came
about
the
ohio
supreme
court
was
not
in
session.
it
has
been
my
personal
experience
that
they
are
not
able
to
get
back
as
quickly
as
has
been
accomplished
in
this
case.
we
fear
that
first
of
all
--
mr.
david
j.
young
in
february,
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
were
attempting
to
comply
a
substantially
as
possible
with
the
ohio
laws.
mr.
david
j.
young
yes,
we
certainly
do
but
in
this
case,
in
february
of
1968
the
plaintiffs
were
operating
under
the
assumption
that
if
they
proceeded
forward
and
obtained
15%
signatures
that
they
would
get
ballot
position
for
the
candidate.
mr.
david
j.
young
if
i
were
in
the
case
then
i
might
have
advise
them
a
little
differently.
mr.
david
j.
young
but
at
that
time
there's
no
question
in
the
world.
but
what
they
were
doing
was
proceeding
on
the
assumption
that
they
could
meet
ohio
law.
in
ohio
law
when
we
say
it's
a
wrong
assumption
is
the
most
confusing
set
of
election
laws
that
you
ever
--
i
mean
it's
just
utterly
impossible
almost
--
mr.
david
j.
young
please?
mr.
david
j.
young
sometimes
the
legislatures
win
and
in
this
case
they
did
over
some.
mr.
david
j.
young
yes,
there
are
two
early
requirements
in
to
get
ballot
position
in
a
case
like
this
if
one
uses
the
new
political
party
technique.
one
of
them,
one
has
to
file
or
a
subversive
kind
of
affidavit
and
then
there's
an
investigation
and
hearing
to
make
sure
that
these
people
are
non-subversives
and
this
was
done
in
this
case.
the
material
was
presented
to
the
secretary
of
state
back
in,
i
think
it
was
may
and
the
secretary
of
state
conducted
an
investigation
and
certified
this
new
political
party
pursuant
to
that
provision
of
the
law.
mr.
david
j.
young
the
petition
that
was
prepared
for
circulation
in
this
case
did
they
make
provisions
for
the
calling
of
a
state
convention
and
holding
of
a
national
convention.
by
the
same
token,
it
gave
alternatives
the
possibility
of
delegating
the
power
to
call
the
state
convention
to
three
people
named
in
the
petition
as
distinguished
from
first
electing
county
chairman
in
all
of
the
counties
throughout
the
state
having
them
to
party
functionaries.
the
petitioners
delegated
the
right
to
call
such
a
convention
to
the
three
people
named
in
the
petition.
mr.
david
j.
young
yes,
the
secretary
of
state
would
not
accept
that
in
this
letter.
by
july
--
no,
wait
a
second,
by
the
middle
of
july
of
this
year,
the
petitioners
in
this
case
had
somewhere
between
300,000
and
350,000
signatures
and
it
appeared
quite
clear
to
them
that
they
would
have
no
difficulty
getting
the
--
an
excess
of
433,000.
at
that
time,
a
request
was
made
of
the
secretary
of
state
of
ohio,
if
we
meet
this
signature
requirement
we'll
be
placed
on
the
ballot.
and
one
of
the
things
that
he
noted
was
that
this
new
party
could
not
call
a
state
convention
which
would
he
select
electors
and
the
reason
he
said
that
they
couldn't
call
a
state
convention
it's
because
the
ohio
statutes
require
existing
office
(inaudible)
attendees
at
the
convention
who
are
apportioned
based
upon
this
party's
vote
at
the
last
election
and
this
is
what
the
ohio
laws
provide.
so
you
see,
--
he's
saying
that
you
haven't
had
and
you
aren't
going
to
have
a
convention
and
you
don't
have
people
that
can
attend
the
convention.
therefore,
you
cannot
certify
electors
to
me.
so,
this
was
one
of
the
reasons
provided
by
the
secretary
of
state
for
refusing.
so,
he
took
the
position
that
our
form
of
holding
a
convention
would
not
satisfy
ohio
law.
mr.
david
j.
young
well,
first
of
all
it
seems
to
me
that
we
did
not
have
in
this
case
a
question
of
interpretation
of
state
laws.
once
you
understand
them,
they
do
bar
ballot
position.
that
seems
to
me
that
plaintiffs
have
a
decision
of
whether
to
seek
relief
in
the
federal
or
in
the
state
court.
quite
frankly,
i
would
have
advice
in
any
given
time
to
file
a
lawsuit
such
as
this
before
three-judge
federal
court.
it
has
been
a
traditional
forum
as
of
late
for
these
kinds
of
cases
and
i
see
no
--
since
it
was
not
--
since
we
don't
have
an
interpretation
of
state
law
question
but
really
a
constitutionally
--
validity
of
state
law.
i
personally
see
no
objection
to
the
federal
court
forum.
mr.
david
j.
young
i
am
in
somewhat
of
a
difficult
position
justice
warren
because
we
did
--
when
you
say
may,
we
came
into
the
case
july
the
23rd
and
filed
it
six
days
later.
(voice
overlap)
my
predecessors
have
filed
it.
mr.
david
j.
young
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
when
they
first
became
convinced
that
regardless
of
whether
they
accomplished
this
petition
requirement
or
not
that
they
would
not
get
on
the
ballot.
you
see
they
went
for,
what
they
first
started
out
they
were
organized
--
this
party
was
organized
in
january
of
1968.
it
recognized
that
the
method
of
nominating
petition
had
been
denied
in
ohio.
you
couldn't
get
on
the
ballot
by
independent
nominating
petition;
i
think
it
could
in
other
states.
mr.
david
j.
young
no,
question
about
that.
mr.
david
j.
young
no
question
about
that.
mr.
david
j.
young
that's
correct.
mr.
david
j.
young
i
think
when
you
look
at
the
posture
--
mr.
david
j.
young
i
don't
think
--
i
think
that
there
would've
been
as
much
confusion
then
as
there
would've
been
when
we
filed
a
lawsuit
but
any
petitioning
group
that's
trying
to
accomplish
ballot
position,
it
seems
to
me
files
itself
in
the
posture
of
doing
everything
possible
to
go
about
it
and
getting
all
the
ballot
without
filing
a
lawsuit.
i
mean
this,
any
candidate
throughout
the
country
is
really
trying
to
accomplish
its
political
objectives
and
if
they
can
get
on
the
ballot
usually
by
using
an
alternate
as
is
the
case
in
many
other
states.
there
are
the
states
that
have
denied
independent
nominating
petition
but
turn
around
and
give
you
a
political
party
method,
it's
practically
the
same
or
it's
attainable.
these
people
apparently
thought,
i
say
apparently
because
i
wasn't
there
then,
apparently
thought,
we
can
meet
the
15%
even
though
it's
--
even
though
it's
burdensome
we've
got
our
strength
to
meet
the
15%
and
i
assume
that's
why
they
went
forward
hoping
that
they
could
get
the
15%
and
get
on
the
ballot
and
not
have
to
file
a
lawsuit.
mr.
david
j.
young
from
what
i
can
be
able
to
--
can
gather
as
they
felt
that
they
could
--
mr.
david
j.
young
i
don't
know
what
they
--
mr.
david
j.
young
they
obviously
did
not.
mr.
david
j.
young
it
certainly
was
knowable
at
that
time.
mr.
david
j.
young
it
was
knowable.
mr.
david
j.
young
yes.
mr.
david
j.
young
my
only
answer
can
be
is
that
they
felt
that
they
could
meet
substantial
compliance
with
the
statutes.
they
went
forward
full
steam
ahead
when
they
learned
that
even
with
substantial
compliance
that
they
wouldn't
get
on
the
ballot.
they
filed
a
lawsuit
as
timely
as
possible.
they
filed
a
lawsuit
in
sufficient
time
to
allow
the
court
to
adjudicate
this
case.
the
case
has
been
able
to
come
all
the
way
up
to
the
united
states
supreme
court
in
time
to
grant
relief.
justice
stewart
was
able
to
order
temporary
relief
without
disrupting
the
ohio
ballot.
so,
true,
the
lawsuit
is
late
but
is
it
late
solely
that
400,000
voters
in
ohio's
right
to
suffer
should
be
denied.
i
agreed
that
the
lawsuit
is
late
but
i
don't
think
it's
too
late
to
--
i
don't
think
relief
should
be
denied
just
because
these
people
didn't
file
earlier.
i
don't
think
the
doctrine
of
laches
would
be
applicable
when
we're
talking
about
the
voting
rights
of
an
excessive
400,000
citizens
in
ohio.
mr.
david
j.
young
yes.
mr.
david
j.
young
yes.
mr.
david
j.
young
yes,
it
seems
to
me
that's
precisely
yet.
i
having
found
this
lawsuit
late
made
a
difficult
for
my
friend
sam
lopeman
to
defend
it
i'm
sure.
but
i
don't
think
that
the
rights
of
any
ohio
citizens
have
been
prejudiced
because
temporary
relief
has
been
granted
much
later
than
that.
so,
we
feel
when
you
look
at
this
case
as
question
of
the
rights
of
400,000
--
450,000
voters
the
doctrine
of
laches
would
not
be
applicable.
if
i
could,
i'd
like
to
reserve
just
a
couple
of
minutes
for
rebuttal.
mr.
david
j.
young
yes.
i
myself
and
i
question
into
the
case
i
have
a
writings
communicated
with
ted
brown,
secretary
of
state
and
i
said,
we
have
petitions
if
we
give
you
sufficient
number,
will
you
put
him
on
the
ballot
and
they
said,
no.
the
only
other
--
mr.
david
j.
young
pardon.
when
i
came
in
to
the
case,
--
mr.
david
j.
young
--
i
notified
the
secretary
of
state
of
how
many
signatures
we
had
that
we
could
meet
the
requirements
and
that
if
we
presented
those
petitions
to
him,
would
he
provide
ballot
position.
he
wrote
back
and
said,
no.
then,
we
had
the
quandary,
what
do
we
do
with
these
petitions?
we
notified
opposing
counsel
that
we
have
them,
that
we
have
them
in
our
offices
and,
did
they
want
to
inspect
them?
they
did
not.
we
turned
them
over
to
a
certified
public
accountant
who
could
attest
to
the
accuracy
of
the
numbers
and
no
duplications
and
they
have
been
in
storage
ever
since.
mr.
david
j.
young
i'm
an
attorney
not
a
politician
and
marvin
griffin's
name
should
appear
in
the
ballot.
mr.
david
j.
young
that's
correct.
mr.
david
j.
young
i
will
answer
you
that
we
are
perfectly
satisfied
with
the
order
of
justice
stewart
placing
on
the
ballot
the
names
that
appeared
in
this
order.
we
do
not
seek
to
have
that
order
modified.
mr.
david
j.
young
i
think
i
can
answer
that
by
staring
at
the
back
that
ohio
has
no
requirement
that
the
electors
vote
for
a
person
to
whom
they're
pledged.
mr.
david
j.
young
my
adversary
said
he
wasn't
aware
of
any
statute
until
someone
just
told
him
today.
mr.
david
j.
young
if
there
is
one,
i'd
like
to
see
it
cited
because
i've
never
been
able
to
find
it
and
i
asked
to
his
co-counsel
during
argument
to
send
me
over
the
statutory
provision
because
i
don't
know
the
one
exist.
mr.
david
j.
young
governor
wallace
under
those
circumstances
has
announced
his
position.
he
has
indicated
that
he
would
come
in
--
mr.
david
j.
young
well,
then
i
can't,
--
but
you
are
asking
me
--
i
beg
your
pardon.
it
seems
to
me
a
political
–
legally,
i
can
answer
--
mr.
david
j.
young
no.
mr.
david
j.
young
we
do
not
think
that
would
be
the
legal
effect,
no.
mr.
david
j.
young
yes.
mr.
david
j.
young
yes.
mr.
david
j.
young
now,
if
you
allow
me
this
to
--
mr.
david
j.
young
if
you
allow
me
to
repeat
what
i
have
read
in
the
papers
i'll
be
glad
to
tell
you
that.
i'm
not
a
member
of
this
party;
i
can
tell
you
that
it's
my
understanding
that
governor
wallace
will
commend
the
electors
to
vote
for
curtis
lemay
as
vice
president
of
the
united
states.
mr.
david
j.
young
the
petitioners
who
signed
this
petition
of
450,000
people
gave
to
the
three
men
who
are
named
in
the
petition,
the
authority
to
call
a
state
convention
or
in
the
absence
of
a
state
convention
to
make
the
selection.
a
state
convention
was
scheduled
when
it
was
indicated
the
results
of
that
convention
would
not
be
recognized
then
it
was
exercised
by
the
other
three.
but
a
state
convention
was
called,
was
scheduled
to
be
held
and
the
secretary
of
state
indicated
that
he
would
not
respect
the
results
of
that
convention
and
i
think
this
answers
the
other
point
as
to
whether
all
of
these
other
laws
do
apply
to
third
parties.
exhibit
13
in
the
transcript
shows
that
the
secretary
of
state
said
that's
why
he
didn't
let
them
on
the
ballot
because
of
those
requirements.
so,
and
my
answer
is
that
i
do
not
feel
that
the
electors
in
ohio
were
pledged
that
as
for
the
vice
presidential
candidate
they
could
select
curtis
lemay
rather
than
marvin
griffin
in
ohio.
mr.
david
j.
young
no.
mr.
david
j.
young
this
is
as
a
matter
of
law
i
find
no
--
mr.
david
j.
young
yes.
mr.
david
j.
young
yes,
i
think
they're
free
to
vote
for
whomever
they
please
in
ohio.
in
ray
versus
blair,
this
court
held
that
a
court
could.
i
mean
a
state
could
establish
pledge
requirements
to
participate
in
a
primary.
this
court
left
open
whether
the
question
of
whether
electors
are
really
free
even
if
there
were
such
a
requirement
to
vote
for
whomever
they
seem
fit
but
there's
no
suggestion
it
seems
to
me
in
any
decision
by
this
court
that
if
a
state
has
no
pledge
requirement
that
the
electors
must
vote
for
anyone.
theoretically,
they
could
vote
for
whomever
they
saw
fit.
one
of
the
final
points
that
i
would
like
to
raise
is
the
matter
of
relief
that
was
touched
upon
before.
the
temporary
order
rendered
by
justice
stewart
would,
in
these
appellants'
standpoint
satisfy
the
temporary
problem
that
exists.
it
seems
to
me
we
have
two
problems;
what
about
the
1968
election
and
what
happens
henceforth?
the
order
rendered
by
justice
stewart
has
been
complied
with.
the
secretary
of
state
has
notified
us
that
if
that
order
is
not
changed,
everything
is
ready
to
move
with
the
name
of
governor
wallace
on
the
ballot.
if
this
court
finds
that
it's
difficult
to
render
a
final
decision
as
to
what's
going
to
happen
in
future
elections
prior
to
say
october
the
15th
then
we
would
think
--
seek
a
temporary
order
affirming
that
what
has
been
accomplished
by
justice
stewart
for
the
1968
election
because
that
has
already
complied
with.
mr.
david
j.
young
oh!
no,
no
sir.
mr.
david
j.
young
there're
no
--
you
made
that
perfectly
clearly
to
us
and
the
order
does
that
this
court
is
free
to
order
governor
wallace
off
the
ballot
but
what
i'm
saying
is
that
all
steps
have
been
taken
and
if
no
other
order
for
example
of
this
court
were
rendered
he
would
be
on
the
ballot
in
the
november
1968
presidential
election.
i
know
the
court
is
troubled
by
the
fact
that
we
did
not
file
this
case
sooner.
the
only
thing
i
can
say
is
that
under
the
old
law
that
was
changed,
38
days
after
we
filed
our
case
these
people
could
have
gotten
on
the
ballot
with
29,000
signatures
as
compared
to
452,000.
in
other
words,
if
these
laws
hadn't
been
changed
38
days
after
we
filed
our
lawsuit,
they
still
could've
gotten
on
the
ballot
in
ohio
with
only
29,000
signatures.
mr.
david
j.
young
independent
candidate,
yes.
mr.
david
j.
young
yes.
under
the
old
law
that
existed
--
mr.
david
j.
young
pre-1948,
sixty
days
before
the
election
with
1%
of
the
signatures
someone
could
get
on
the
ballot.
mr.
david
j.
young
that's
correct,
yes.
and
this
was
the
method
first
sought
in
ohio
by
these
people
and
when
it
was
foreclosed
then
they
moved
in
the
political
party
direction.
mr.
david
j.
young
that's
--
except
to
the
indirect
--
mr.
david
j.
young
yes,
before
1948,
all
of
the
parties
used
the
independent
nominating
petition
technique
because
that
provided
that
even
though
you
were
technically
an
independent
candidate
you'd
put
a
label.
so,
all
of
the
political
parties
in
ohio
before
1948
used
the
independent
nominating
petition
technique
but
they
were
allowed
to
put
a
label
next
to
the
name.
so,
that's
how
there
was
this
free
--
there
was
this
flourishing
of
independent
parties
under
the
prior
system.
just
a
final
point,
i
see
my
time
is
up,
i
do
hope
this
case
is
not
decided
on
the
basis
that
it
is
possible
to
get
on
the
ballot
in
ohio.
this
group
had
over
2,700,000
throughout
the
country,
450,000
signatures
in
ohio
at
adequate
strength
that
comply
with
any
kind
of
a
requirement
and
it
isn't
a
question
of
time,
i've
cited
in
my
brief
but
there's
just
no
way.
they're
completely
barred
from
these
statutes
and
i
hope
whatever
decision
is
rendered
is
rendered
on
recognition
that
independent
and
third
party
candidates
are
barred
and
barred
effectively
from
participating
in
presidential
elections
in
ohio.
i
hope
that
at
least
as
far
as
the
temporary
relief
by
october
the
15th,
we
can
receive
an
order
confirming
the
order
of
justice
stewart
and
that
the
situation
by
order
of
this
court
or
upon
remand
will
ultimately
be
cleared
up
in
ohio
so
that
will
have
free
elections
not
--
mr.
david
j.
young
because
there
are
two
questions
before
the
court,
the
matter
of
temporary
relief
and
ultimate
relief.
mr.
lopeman's
statement
suggested
to
me
that
unless
you
order
his
name
off
the
ballot
by
october
the
15th,
they're
going
to
have
a
hard
time
taking
it
off.
so,
it
seems
to
me
you
got
a
time
pressure
on
the
temporary
question
before
you
but
not
as
much
time
pressure
on
the
ultimate
relief
question
of
how
do
we
handle
all
the
future
elections
in
ohio.
mr.
david
j.
young
yes,
yes
as
--
mr.
david
j.
young
i
don't
think
it's
necessary
for
the
court
to
make
that
adjudication
because
even
the
name
appearing
on
the
ballot
as
it
does
now
with
the
label
would
be
much
the
same
as
the
old
technique
that
we
used
in
ohio.
mr.
david
j.
young
i
probably
go
way
please
it
with
the
temporary
relief
that
we've
received.
mr.
david
j.
young
well,
--
mr.
david
j.
young
here's
the
situation
you
have
before
you
is
that
the
lower
court
all
three
judges
of
the
federal
district
court
below
found
ohio's
laws
were
unconstitutional.
they
were
unconstitutional
insofar
as
they
denied
ballot
position
to
independent
candidates
and
to
third
party
candidates.
and
you
have
--
mr.
david
j.
young
they
did
say
that
but
they
also
declared
these
laws
to
be
unconstitutional.
i
don't
think
this
court
would
apply
laches
to
millions
of
voters
in
this
cause
no
one's
hurt.
i
mean
laches
is
a
balancing
of
interest.
who
on
the
one
hand
is
hurt
as
compared
with
taking
the
right
of
suffrage
away
from
these
100,000
of
voters?
mr.
david
j.
young
the
district
court
did
decide
that
that
they
have
rights,
that
they
had
equal
protection
rights
and
that
the
state
of
ohio
has
violated
the
equal
protection
law
of
cause
when
it
denied
ballot
position
to
independent
third
party
candidates.
mr.
david
j.
young
i
just
have
a
strong
belief
that
this
court
will
decide
rights
do
exists
under
these
circumstances.
i'm
rather
shock
by
the
contentions
i
hear
that
they
do
not
and
i
feel
comfort
this
court
will
find
some
rights
no
matter
what
the
outcome
is.
thank
you
very
kindly.
mr.
david
j.
young
no,
your
honor
because
we
do
not
have
this.
mr.
david
j.
young
i
was
told
by
my
co-counsel
that
he
believe
there
was.
it
is
my
understanding
now
that
there
is
a
requirement
in
ohio
that
presidential
electors
at
the
time
they
are
certified
to
the
secretary
of
state
from
the
state
political
convent
--
party
convention
are
required
to
pled
that
they
will
vote
for
the
candidate
of
the
party.
i
think
that
is
the
only
limitation
and
again
i
would
--
mr.
david
j.
young
that's
correct.
mr.
david
j.
young
i
don't
believe
there
is
now,
i'm
going
back
and
forth
but
this
is
my
understanding
knowing
everything
that
i
know
about
it.
mr.
david
j.
young
yes,
your
honor
if
this
--
mr.
david
j.
young
i
would
think
that
it
would
be
up
to
the
order
of
this
court;
i
don't
know
what
it
is.
we
have
departed
from
ohio
election
law.
we're
way
passed,
we're
nine
months
passed
ohio
election
law
and
i
can't
answer
that
question.
you
have
to
answer
that
for
me
by
putting
in
your
word
is
there
is
any
need
to
mention
electors
what
these
electors
are
going
to
do.
mr.
david
j.
young
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court,
mr.
lopeman,
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
outset
i
would
like
to
introduce
mr.
stan
sikes,
an
attorney
admitted
to
the
bar
of
alabama
whose
associated
with
me
in
this
case.
mr.
david
j.
young
first
of
all,
the
appellants
would
like
to
express
their
appreciation
to
the
court
for
the
dispatch
and
vigilance
with
which
they
have
scheduled
this
case,
the
case
that
may
very
well
need
additional
remedial
relief
to
protect
the
most
basic
of
all
of
our
rights
in
society,
the
right
to
vote.
we
recognized
that
this
has
been
an
inconvenience
to
the
court
but
we
are
grateful
that
we
have
scheduled
the
case
so
expeditiously.
we
place
this
case
before
the
court
in
urging
fashion
because
we
believe
that
the
integrity
of
the
1968
presidential
election
is
at
stake.
we
believe
that
the
transcript
evidence
before
the
court
amply
demonstrates
that
plaintiff's
candidate
governor
wallace
has
sufficient
voter
support
in
ohio
that
his
chances
of
carrying
that
state
are
very
substantial.
we
--
the
transcript
evidence
shows
polls
that
were
taken
and
they
were
placed
before
the
lower
court
and
each
of
the
answers
to
those
polls
was
prefaced
on
the
condition
that
if
governor
wallace's
name
appears
on
the
ballot
they
would
vote
for
him.
on
the
other
hand,
it
would
appear
to
us
and
from
the
evidence
in
the
transcript
that
if
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
are
relegated
to
the
federal
court
relief
of
write-in
status,
this
governor
wallace's
name
is
taken
off
the
ballot
in
ohio
that
his
supporters
in
that
state
might
as
well
forget
about
those
26
electoral
votes.
thus,
we
appear
before
the
court
today
seeking
relief
that's
not
only
essential
to
the
protection
of
the
equal
protection
of
the
law
rights
of
the
voters
in
ohio
of
the
candidates
of
the
minor
political
parties
but
also
a
protection
of
the
integrity
of
this
presidential
election
and
an
order
which
will
convince
at
least
452,000
voters
in
ohio
that
they
cannot
be
fenced
out
of
the
democratic
elective
process
simply
because
their
views
do
not
agree
with
the
views
of
the
majority
party.
mr.
david
j.
young
there
they
have
not.
we
tendered
them
to
the
election
officials.
they
did
not
care
to
review
them
at
the
time
they
were
placed
before
the
district
court
--
lower
district
court,
they
were
placed
before
them
as
the
transcript
indicates
by
certified
public
accountant.
now,
of
course
he
would
not
have
verified
some
of
the
things
that
he
couldn't
verify.
the
petitions
that
were
before
the
lower
court
are
not
required
by
ohio
law
to
be
registered
voters.
therefore,
the
only
verification
that
would
be
necessary
would
be
the
age
and
the
residence
in
the
state
of
ohio.
the
duplications
were
called
out.
mr.
david
j.
young
that
is
correct.
mr.
david
j.
young
under
ohio
law,
we
have
an
ohio
statute
and
we
have
that
for
many
years
that
states
that
a
vote
for
a
presidential
candidate
whose
name
appears
on
the
ballot
is
considered
as
a
vote
for
the
electors'
pledge
to
him
who
have
been
certified
by
that
candidate
or
party
to
the
secretary
of
state.
the
order
of
the
lower
court
then
provided
that
a
right
hand
vote
for
a
presidential
candidate
would
be
considered
as
a
vote
for
the
electors
certified
to
the
secretary
of
state.
mr.
david
j.
young
no,
in
this
case
have
until
october
the
15th
to
accomplish
that
certification.
mr.
david
j.
young
we
did
not.
mr.
david
j.
young
we
did
not
seek.
mr.
david
j.
young
no,
i
do
think
that
the
write-in
does
protect
certain
fundamental
constitutional
rights
when
the
--
mr.
david
j.
young
not
and
of
itself,
no
and
perhaps
i
might
get
ahead
of
myself
and
explain
why.
i
think
that
a
very
significant
aspect
of
the
inadequacy
of
the
relief
afforded
by
the
lower
court
in
this
case
is
demonstrated
when
one
reviews
the
election
laws
in
ohio
and
their
relationship
to
the
methods
of
write-in
voting.
in
ohio,
we
have
an
excess
of
13,000
precincts
of
with
polling
places.
the
elections
of
such
are
governed
by
the
88
counties
in
the
state.
each
clerk
of
the
board
of
elections
then
and
that
board
of
elections
selects
the
voting
method
that
he
feels
would
best
suit
his
county's
conditions.
now,
the
problem
is
that
there
are
five
different
voting
methods
scattered
throughout
the
state
of
ohio
in
this
88
counties
and
13,000
precincts
may
review
them
just
real
quickly.
first
of
all,
the
basic
paper
ballot
and
of
course
the
difficulties
of
a
write-in,
statewide
write-in
campaign
aren't
too
great
with
that
ballot
because
that
simply
has
an
extra
space
and
rather
than
checking
the
space
with
the
name
on
it;
one
writes
in
the
name
in
the
extra
space
and
then
checks
it.
moving
from
there
however,
we
move
to
what
we
call
the
synthesized
paper
ballot
that
is
used
in
the
county
--
hamilton
county
with
the
third
largest
country
in
the
state
of
ohio
with
city
of
cincinnati
in
that
county.
they
used
a
synthesized
ballot
the
record
shows.
it's
a
punch
card
that
has
four
holes
on
the
pointers
of
that
synthesized
ballot.
in
order
to
--
now,
the
reason
i
have
those
are
these
are
counted
at
the
secretary
of
state's
office.
they
are
transported
to
the
secretary
of
state
put
on
the
machine
and
they
push
a
button
and
just
all
go
down
to
the
machine
and
the
synthesized
votes
are
recorded.
now,
when
a
voter
in
ohio
would
approach
the
booth
to
use
that
kind
of
a
voting
device,
he
would
be
given
a
cigar
or
lighter
kind
of
apparatus
that
he
would
stamp
his
choice
for
the
name
of
the
candidates.
and
on
this
stamp
makes
the
marking
that's
recorded
in
this
machine.
if
he
wanted
to
write
in,
he
couldn't
use
this
apparatus.
it
writes
too
large.
there
would
be
pencils
available.
now,
if
you
pick
up
the
pencil
first
and
started
to
write
in,
there's
no
written
instructions
in
the
booth
or
on
the
card
to
show
that
the
pencil
would
not
record
any
of
the
votes
for
all
of
the
other
candidates.
so,
if
he
--
he
couldn't
use
the
cigar
lighter-kind
of
apparatus
to
write
in,
he
couldn't
use
the
pencil
to
mark
the
other
ones.
the
only
way
of
voter
in
ohio
in
this
election
would
know
what
to
do
would
have
to
be
asked
the
voting
officials.
so,
this
is
going
to
--
and
then
of
course
they'll
have
to
call
out
all
of
the
synthesized
cards
with
any
writing
on
them
and
count
them
twice.
from
those
two
methods,
we
move
to
the
three
voting
machine
methods.
the
first
one
as
the
record
demonstrates
is
the
shupe
(ph)
method
which
probably
is
the
easiest
to
use
in
write-in
situations.
it
is
the
voting
machine
that
has
the
offices
listed
vertically
in
to
the
left
and
then
the
candidates
to
the
right.
it's
quite
simple
to
use
the
write-in
process
in
those
because
the
little
door
that
you
lift
up
to
find
the
paper
is
just
to
the
left
of
the
office.
and
so
you
just
go
over
then
write-in
but
the
more
frequently
used
automatic
voting
machine
has
its
candidates
and
officers
horizontally
across
the
top
and
it
has
a
little
box
some
place
else
where
you
have
to
lift
up
doors
to
find
the
place
to
vote.
you
have
to
correlate
a
number
that's
attributed
to
a
specific
office
and
go
up
some
place
else
on
the
machine
and
lift
up
a
door
that
relates
to
that
number
and
then
write-in
your
vote.
for
this
particular
year,
there's
a
major
problem
the
little
slants
where
you
write-in
slant
in
this
direction
for
a
right
hand
voter
and
a
left
handed
voter
would
almost
have
to
stand
on
his
head
to
get
up
and
write-in
on
that
space.
mr.
david
j.
young
yes.
mr.
david
j.
young
yes.
mr.
david
j.
young
yes.
mr.
david
j.
young
not
in
this
case.
the
final
voting
apparatus
that
i
would
discuss
is
the
coil
voting
machine.
this
will
present
the
problems
also
because
it
hasn't
--
it's
really
a
tabulating
machine
as
the
record
shows.
a
voter
picks
up
an
ibm
card,
this
is
later
counted
by
an
ibm
machine
and
he
puts
this
ibm
card
into
this
tabulating
--
into
this
marking
apparatus,
a
glass
plate
fits
over
it
and
it
magnifies
the
markings
on
this
ballot
and
then
you
go
through
and
turn
the
card
around
and
then
when
you
get
to
the
office
that
you
want
to
vote
for
you
punch
it
and
it
makes
a
mark
on
the
ballot.
in
order
to
write-in,
you
have
to
get
that
card
out
of
the
machine
and
get
it
back
down
and
write.
now,
i
would
be
pretty
simple
to
most
people
but
i
think
a
lot
of
people
might
not
realize
how
they're
going
to
write
with
that
card
inside
the
magnified
apparatus.
mr.
david
j.
young
yes,
and
i
think
down
south
in
one
of
the
other
counties
that
maybe
sam
can
tell
us
later
on.
i
think
that's
down
the
southern
counties
in
ohio.
what
i
think
that
an
explanation
of
these
five
different
kinds
of
voting
devices
suggest
if
the
other
frustration
of
trying
to
mount
a
statewide
voter
education
campaign
of
how
you're
going
to
go
in
and
exercise
the
write-in
right
to
vote.
it
would
be
extremely
difficult
for
some
people
even
to
accomplish
it
in
many
voters
with
many
of
the
apparatus
would
have
to
discuss
this
with
the
voting
officials
and
reveal
in
essence
who
they're
seeking
to
vote
for
when
they're
trying
to
determine
how
to
use
this
write-in
device
on
these
machines.
the
record
before
the
court
indicates
that
governor
wallace's
supporters
have
obtained
ballot
position
for
him
in
all
49
states.
he
has
been
certified
in
a
49
states
now
and
of
course
if
we
include
the
temporary
order
this
would
be
50
states.
but
for
this
litigation
and
that's
why
it
was
broad
this
year,
in
the
presidential
election
ohio
would
--
could
shamefully
alone
is
the
only
state
in
the
country
denying
ballot
position
to
a
presidential
candidate
who
could
demonstrate
sufficient
voter
support
to
satisfy
any
reasonable
any
qualification
requirement
--
ballot
position
requirement
established
by
any
state.
we've
demonstrated
to
the
court.
we
hope
that
ohio's
election
laws
are
more
harsh
and
more
discriminatory
as
they
relate
to
the
independent
and
third
party
candidate
and
voter
than
any
other
state
in
the
country.
mr.
sikes
was
doing
some
computations
for
me.
when
we
look
through
the
voting
laws
in
all
47
states
where
some
form
of
a
signature
petition
was
used,
the
three
others
--
there
were
three
states.
one
of
them
the
convention
which
used
alabama
(voice
overlap)
--
the
total
requirement
in
district
of
ohio
(inaudible)
were
signature
petitions
were
used.
the
total
requirement
and
this
included
ohio
of
signatures
was
1,052,867.
when
you
subtract
ohio's
requirement
from
this,
433,100
it
takes
619,000
signatures
using
our
methods
to
get
on
the
ballot
in
46
states
and
433,100
a
pretty
close
to
that
i
figured
just
to
get
on
the
ballot
on
the
state
of
ohio
and
after
you
get
those
signatures
before
the
secretary
of
state
you
still
can't
get
on
the
ballot
and
we
hope
to
demonstrate
that
later
on.
just
the
15%
requirement
that
we'll
be
talking
about
is
75
times
higher
than
the
percentage
requirement
in
the
state
of
new
york.
30
times
higher
then
the
ballot
position
requirements
in
each
of
the
average
of
the
each
of
the
five
states
bordering
on
the
state
of
ohio.
mr.
david
j.
young
which
point
is
that
mr.
justice
white?
mr.
david
j.
young
it
would
be
helpful
but
it
seems
to
me
that
even
if
the
15%
requirement
were
held
to
be
constitutional.
there
are
several
other
aspects
of
ohio's
voting
laws
which
would
demonstrate
their
violation
of
the
protection
of
equal
protection
laws.
mr.
david
j.
young
let's
assume
they
were
not?
mr.
david
j.
young
if
unfortunately,
once
you
get
the
15%
you're
nowhere
in
the
state
of
ohio.
mr.
david
j.
young
on
--
it
didn't
know
what
you
say
by
in
time
justice
white.
mr.
david
j.
young
there
is
no
statute
in
the
state
of
ohio
that
requires
the
15%
to
be
in
it
any
time
other
than
90
days
before
an
election.
mr.
david
j.
young
now,
the
sec
--
mr.
david
j.
young
yes,
but
perhaps
i
should
explain
why
the
argument
is
improperly
so
that
in
order
to
get
on
the
ballot
as
a
presidential
candidate
you
would
have
to
have
delegates
to
a
national
convention
elected
a
primary.
mr.
david
j.
young
yes.
mr.
david
j.
young
i
don't
--
i
wouldn't
agree
because
here
again
i
think
the
mere
denial,
the
first
attempt,
was
an
independent
nominating
petition.
the
mere
fact
that
that
is
denied
was
taken
away
from
voters
in
the
state
of
ohio
in
1948
in
and
of
itself
would
justify
relief
in
this
case,
it
seems
to
me
even
if
--
mr.
david
j.
young
yes,
if
they
said
that
we
must
go
through
a
political
party
process
then
we
would
have
to
show
that
the
15%
is
unconstitutional.
i'm
satisfied
that
we
can
show
that
to
this
court
but
--
mr.
david
j.
young
that's
correct.
now,
we
do
not
suggest
to
the
court
however
that
because
we
could
get
the
15%
that
it's
not
a
overwhelmingly
prohibitive
requirement,
if
he
must
have
some
reasonable
relationship
to
a
permissible
state
policy.
mr.
david
j.
young
yes,
although,
we
would
hope
to
convince
the
court
that
the
timing
is
not
the
significant
factor
but
rather
that
no
matter
when
if
we
would've
file
those
petitions
five
years
ahead
of
time,
five
years
before
this
election
we
still
couldn't
got
known
the
ballot
because
there
are
so
many
other
pitfalls
for
the
new
party
that
that
15%
wouldn't
have
done
as
a
bit
of
good.
we
still
couldn't
have
got
on
the
ballot.
mr.
david
j.
young
that's
correct.
that's
correct
and
the
15%
timing
is
only
significant
insofar
as
it
relates
to
those
other
provisions
because
if
those
other
provisions
didn't
exist
we
wouldn't
have
to
worry
about
--
mr.
david
j.
young
now,
i'm
not
making
myself
clear
justice
white
because
the
ohio
could
not
have
said
that.
the
law
says,
the
petition
must
be
in
90
days
before
the
election.
now,
if
you
knockout
those
other
laws,
there
would
be
no
requirement
that
it
be
in
on
february
the
7th,
august
the
7th
would
be
perfectly
satisfactory.
there
is
no
statute
in
the
state
of
ohio
that
requires
the
15%
to
be
in
90
days
before
the
primary.
that
only
comes
about
if
you
uphold
the
other
party
primary
provisions
which
would
be
prohibitive
against
this
party.
if
you
threw
those
statutes
out,
the
15%,
90
days
before
the
general
election
would
be
satisfactory
under
ohio
law.
i
know
it's
very
complicated
but
this
comes
about
by
an
interrelated
reading
of
this
statute
with
the
political
primary
statute.
it's
only
by
inference
from
the
primary
statutes
that
we
get
this
necessity
of
filing
90
days
before
the
primary.
one
could
read
the
laws
i
suggest
the
average
lawyer
for
50
hours
and
he
would
never
realize
that
that
petition
had
to
be
in
90
days
with
a
primary
because
there's
--
unless
you
understand
every
single
election
statute
you
don't
get
to
that
result.
mr.
david
j.
young
no,
it
would
mean
that
election
first
in
some
instances.
let's
say
we
were
not
attempting
to
qualify
a
presidential
candidate
or
some
other
kind
of
candidate
then
that
word
“election”
would
not
mean
primary.
it
could
mean
general
election,
it
could
me
primary,
it
could
mean
special
depending
on
what
use
you
were
trying
to
make
of
the
15%.
mr.
david
j.
young
yes,
we
concede
in
this
case
in
order
to
get
on
the
ballot
if
they
weren't
all
these
other
unconstitutional
statutes
we
would've
had
to
file
on
february
7,
1968.
yes,
no
question
about
that.
the
state
of
ohio
throughout
this
case
and
in
its
briefs
that
are
before
the
court
at
the
present
time
have
conceded
the
motivation,
the
reason
for
the
adoption
of
the
key
statutes
that
we're
concerned
about
in
this
case.
as
to
the
legislation,
amendments
that
occurred
during
--
back
in
1948
to
1952
which
completely
eliminated
the
right
of
nomination
of
independent
candidates.
they
have
stated
that
independent
candidacy
is
an
evil.
and
then
they
explain
it's
an
evil
because
people
end
up
voting
for
someone
they
really
shouldn't
vote
for.
and
that
these
statutes
back
in
1948-1952
were
designed
to
stamp
out
that
evil
to
wit
independent
candidacy.
as
to
the
political
party
laws,
the
state
of
ohio
states
that
it
is
a
legitimate
purpose
to
prevent
third
party
candidates
or
third
parties
from
interfering
with
the
chances
of
the
two
major
party
candidates
to
get
a
clear
cut
victory
in
election.
we
concede
those
motivations
also
and
we
do
not
believe
that
they
withstand
the
requirements
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
we
do
not
believe
that
these
are
legitimate
or
permissible
state
policies.
mr.
david
j.
young
yes
and
that's
why
i
started
out.
mr.
david
j.
young
yes,
justice
stewart.
mr.
david
j.
young
when
i
read
that
section
of
the
united
states
constitution
i
note
that
it
provides
that
a
state
may
appoint
--
mr.
david
j.
young
shall
appoint.
mr.
david
j.
young
that's
correct.
shall
appoint
its
presidential
electors,
our
constitutional
history
tells
us
that
subsequent
to
about
the
1870's
that
no
state
has
appointed
its
presidential
electors
by
the
legislative
body
doing
so
but
rather
they
have
appointed
their
presidential
electors
by
either
--
by
one
form
or
another
of
letting
the
electorate
vote
for
them.
so,
when
i
read
that
section,
i
do
note
that
the
state
could
appoint
but
when
i
read
it
in
conjunction
with
what
the
--
this
supreme
court
has
stated
for
example
in
the
harper
case
that
once
a
state
exercises
a
constitutional
power
by
delegating
that
two
the
voters
in
the
state
that
that
delegation
must
comply
with
the
requirements
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
constitution
of
united
states.
mr.
david
j.
young
i
--
i'm
just
probably
so
but
as
i
read
this
court's
decisions
i'm
not
100%
--
mr.
david
j.
young
certainly,
but
pardon
me
--
mr.
david
j.
young
that's
certainly
correct.
now,
i
did
not
include
in
my
reply
brief
but
on
the
day
that
i
had
to
file
it
i
called
opposing
counsel
and
noted
that
with
reference
to
that
argument
i
should've
cited
one
case
by
this
court
which
i
feel
comes
closes
to
answering
that
particular
contention
and
i
gave
the
citation
to
counsel
last
friday
and
that's
the
case
of
katzenbach
versus
morgan.
the
court
will
recall
this
was
the
new
york
case
where
the
state
of
new
york
was
attempting
to
uphold
its
literary
test
--
literacy
test
requirement
as
a
qualification
to
voting
and
as
against
the
federal
legislation
the
voting
rights
act
which
stated
that
if
one
attended
puerto
rican
schools
and
went
to
sixth
grade
and
wasn't
taught
english
that
they
could
not
be
barred
from
voting.
now,
one
of
the
arguments
presented
in
that
case
was
the
fact
that
the
state
of
new
york
by
reason
of
direct
constitutional
grant,
united
states
constitutional
grant
had
the
power
to
establish
qualifications
of
voters
in
election
for
united
states
--
members
of
the
united
states
house
of
representative
and
united
states
senators.
so
in
another
words,
in
this
instance,
the
state
like
a
state
would
be
doing
it
if
we're
appointing
electors
was
doing
exactly
what
the
united
states
constitution
told
it
to
do.
and
i
have
this
real
brief
little
quote
here
that
i
think
comes
very
close
to
answering
this
requirement.
it
starts
up
by
recognizing
under
the
distribution
of
powers
affected
by
the
constitution.
the
state
established
qualifications
for
voting
for
state
officers
and
the
qualifications
established
by
the
states
for
voting
for
members
of
the
most
numerous
branch
of
the
state
legislature
also
determined
who
may
vote
for
united
states
representatives
and
senators
and
then
cites
some
authorities.
but
of
course,
the
states
have
no
power
to
grant
or
withhold
the
franchise
on
conditions
that
are
forbidden
by
the
fourteenth
amendment
or
any
other
provisions
of
the
constitution.
such
exercises
of
state
power
are
no
more
immune
to
the
limitations
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
than
any
other
state
action.
now,
as
i
read
that
this
court
is
saying
that
regardless
of
the
source
of
whether
the
state
is
regulating
the
qualifications
simply
by
reason
of
the
reserved
powers
in
the
state
in
the
constitution
or
because
of
some
constitutional
grant
of
authority
like
they
were
doing
in
the
katzenbach
case
but
still
that
the
restraints
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
still
apply.
mr.
david
j.
young
yes.
mr.
david
j.
young
those
are
differences
i
don't
see
the
distinction
the
same
as
you
do
justice
stewart
but
certainly
they
are
differences.
it
seems
to
me
that
that
section
that
you
are
referring
to
however
does
not
go
on
and
say,
the
state
shall
appoint
in
such
manners
it
will
direct
without
regard
to
the
protections
of
such
and
such
and
such
and
such.
mr.
david
j.
young
before
the
fourteenth
amendment?
mr.
david
j.
young
i
don't
think
we
would
have.
mr.
david
j.
young
i'm
not
sure
that
that
would
--
we
would
have
to
say
modification
because
i
don't
read
that
original
provision
is
saying
in
such
manners
they
shall
direct
discriminatory
or
otherwise
and
no
case
of
this
court
has
ever
held
to
my
knowledge
that
simply
because
of
that
provision
that
once
the
state
went
forward
with
their
appointment
and
appointed
by
way
of
delegation
to
the
electorate,
they
could
do
it
a
discriminatory
fashion.
the
old
case
that
we
cited
by
our
opponents
mcpherson
versus
blacker,
it
seems
to
me
even
in
that
case
which
yes
it
was
after
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
david
j.
young
went
on
and
indicated
that
there
was
no
discrimination
alleged
in
that
case.
mr.
david
j.
young
that
is
precisely
our
position
if
i
need
plenty
other
answers
suggested
that
was
otherwise
then
i
hope
you
disregard
it,
that
is
precisely
our
position
in
this
case.
mr.
david
j.
young
well,
--
mr.
david
j.
young
and
once
we
conceded
that
after
the
state
begins
delegating
to
the
voters
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
protections
apply,
that
seems
to
me
that
kind
of
delegation
clearly
must
fall
because
there
would
not
be
a
legitimate
and
permissible
state
policy
to
limit
presidential
candidates
or
presidential
electors
only
to
those
who
in
here
to
the
beliefs
of
the
republican
or
democratic
parties.
so,
it
would
be
my
(voice
overlap).
mr.
david
j.
young
i
feel
that
would
be
blatant
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
just
as
much
as
they
said,
you
must
choose
between
jewish
and
catholic
--
members
of
the
jewish
and
catholic
religious
faith.
i
don
think
there's
any
justifiable,
permissible
basis
for
establishing
such
distinctions
and
i
think
that
such
a
delegation
would
fall
and
should
fall.
mr.
david
j.
young
any
restrictions,
we
do
concede,
yes.
we
think
that
the
state
has
indicated
by
this
court
in
many,
many
cases
the
carrington
case
and
others
that
it
is
--
the
state
has
performed
the
historic
function
of
protecting
the
ballot,
protecting
the
integrity
of
its
elections,
making
sure
that
citizen's
right
to
vote
was
really
meaningful
and
they
had
proper
methods
for
voting
accuracy
and
all
the
rest.
so,
we
do
feel
that
a
state
made
a
place
of
restrictions
on
all
of
these
items
but
that
in
order
to
prevail
and
in
order
to
withstand
constitutional
challenge
that
these
must
be
reasonably
or
rationally
related
to
a
permissible
state
purpose.
i
think
that
in
the
case
at
bar
--
in
the
case
at
bar,
counsel
and
the
state
of
ohio
has
said
what
their
purpose
in
one
of
the
statute
says.
their
purpose
is
to
stamp
out
independent
candidacy.
now,
the
statutes
they
adopted
was
rationally
related
to
that
first
purpose.
but
it
seems
to
me
the
second
half
of
the
proposition
fails
that
that
purpose
is
not
a
permissible
state
purpose.
so,
that
would
not
--
these
are
not
--
mr.
david
j.
young
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
united
states
constitution.
mr.
david
j.
young
that
which
demands
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws.
mr.
david
j.
young
as
i
have
framed
the
case,
i
have
placed
it
upon
the
equal
protection
clause.
mr.
david
j.
young
i
have
not
come
up
with
a
theory
that
would
put
it
into
the
due
process
category.
it
seems
to
us
that
the
equal
protection
clause
was
so
applicable
here.
mr.
david
j.
young
the
first
amendment
is
significant,
it's
not
a
significant
to
ballot
position
but
it
is
significant
in
this
whole
area
because
of
the
free
speech
right
and
any
--
it
seems
to
us
any
legislation
that
prevents
organization
in
free
participation
of
minority
parties
in
the
political
spectrum
interstate
can
if
the
regulations
are
not
reasonably
related
to
a
permissible
state
policy
and
it
isn't
permissible
just
to
discriminate
against
them,
it's
got
yet
some
other
reason.
that
in
that
instance
if
it
denied
participation
which
our
laws
do
in
ohio
then
it
seems
to
me
where
impairing
a
free
speech
rights
too.
mr.
david
j.
young
so
do
we
and
we
ask
why
we
based
the
right
to
organize.
mr.
david
j.
young
it
would
seem
to
us
that
the
first
amendment
has
brought
in
through
the
fourteenth
permits
the
right
to
--
mr.
david
j.
young
the
due
process?
okay.
gives
us
the
right
to
organize
but
we
want
to
go
further
than
just
organize
and
just
participate.
it
seems
to
me
that
what
we
really
need
in
this
instance
is
ballot
position
and
the
reason
we
aren't
getting
ballot
position
is
because
of
a
--
laws
that
are
discriminatory
that
do
not
provide
equal
protection
of
the
laws
and
that's
why
we
have
based
it
but
certainly
this
analysis
would
suggest
that
perhaps
we
could've
place
some
more
emphasize
on
the
due
process
clause.
i
concede
that.
mr.
david
j.
young
yes,
justice
fortas.
mr.
david
j.
young
yes.
i
do
see
it,
it's
a
very
substantial
distinction
when
i
explain
it,
i
want
to
make
it
perfectly
clear
that
we
have
no
objection
to
the
socialist
labor
party
appearing
on
the
ballot.
mr.
david
j.
young
once
we
start
out
with
the
proposition
recognizing
because
of
the
state
historic
function
in
controlling
its
procedures
that
it
can
come
up
with
some
reasonable
regulation
related
to
a
legitimate
policy.
it
seems
to
us
if
we
accept
that
proposition
that
the
state
could
establish
some
reasonable
requirements
preliminary
to
obtaining
ballot
position
practically
every
state
in
the
country
does
this.
now,
if
it's
a
number
requirement,
it
has
to
be
the
size
of
the
number
has
to
be
carefully
scrutinized
to
make
certain
that
the
true
purpose
and
effect
isn't
just
discrimination
rather
than
making
certain
that
we
don't
have
--
i
mean
we
couldn't
let
every
citizen
have
his
name
on
the
ballot.
mr.
david
j.
young
perhaps
the
way
you've
asked
the
question
i
would
direct
them
that
if
they
are
to
be
requirements
that
they'll
be
reasonable
requirements
--
mr.
david
j.
young
yes,
i
do
think
so.
mr.
david
j.
young
it
seems
to
us
that
when
one
brings
a
case
like
this
before
the
court,
he
must
need
two
objectives.
first
of
all,
demonstrate
the
unconstitutionality
of
the
legislation
as
being
challenged.
and
secondly,
demonstrate
by
reason
of
principles
of
equity
that
the
court
should
grant
equitable
relief.
now,
if
a
party
came
before
the
three-judge
district
court
in
ohio
and
said,
we
have
one
member
and
we
don't
want
any
more
members
and
then
one
came
in
with
450,000
signatories
on
a
petition.
it
seems
to
us
that
a
court
of
equity
could
make
a
distinction
on
these
grounds
as
justice
--
judge
kinneary
did
in
this
case.
his
distinction
was
that
this
party
has
demonstrated
that
it
has
sufficient
voter
straight
can
be
any
constitutionally
permissible
number
figure.
he
did
not
find
that
the
other
party
had
demonstrated
that
it
could
meet
constitutionally
permissible
standards.
then,
the
court
of
equity
must
decide
and
take
it
the
clearer
case
the
one
man
party
in
the
450,000
is
at
state
law
that
kept
this
one
man
party
off
the
ballot
or
is
it
just
the
mere
fact
that
they
aren't
large
enough
to
be
on
the
ballot.
so,
it
seems
to
me
that
once
you
concede
reasonable
number's
regulations
then
it
seems
to
me
you
get
to
the
proposition
that
in
plaintiffs
coming
before
court
of
equity
and
asking
equitable
relief
that
a
judge
will
look
to
their
strength
and
to
see
whether
the
laws
themselves
or
would
kept
this
party
off
the
ballot.
mr.
david
j.
young
that
is
certainly
something
that
this
court
would
consider.
i
would
assume
that
the
facts
in
the
case
and
whether
they
have
shown
to
the
court
that
equitable
relief
is
appropriate
and
i
think
the
numbers
are
--
is
probably
the
one
of
the
biggest
factors
in
this
case
452,000
signatures.
mr.
david
j.
young
i
have
no
misgivings
about
this
court
directing
the
ohio
general
assembly
to
adhere
to
the
united
states
constitution
in
this
case
anymore
than
in
the
redistricting
cases,
or
malapportionment
cases
or
many
other
cases.
mr.
david
j.
young
i
have
no
quarrel
with
that
proposition.
mr.
david
j.
young
if
it's
mine
then
i
champion
it.
mr.
david
j.
young
well,
in
effect,
it
seems
to
me
in
the
apportionment
cases,
this
court
or
upon
remand
the
lower
courts
the
court
have
said
that
no
election
may
go
forward
until
you
--
reapportion
your
areas
of
some
elections
have
been
voided
by
federal
court
cases,
are
set
aside
because
there
was
not
properly
apportioned
and
it
seems
to
me
that
it
was
always
conditioned
--
mr.
david
j.
young
well,
perhaps
then
and
that's
exactly
what
i'm
saying.
i'm
not
playing
upon
how
this
court
or
any
other
federal
court
causes
the
--
a
particular
state
legislature
to
accomplish
this.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
this
court
were
to
say
to
the
ohio
general
assembly
that
unless
you
revise
your
laws
to
permit
reasonable
participation
by
independent
and
third
party
candidates
that
there
can
be
no
elections
under
those
laws.
this
in
effect
is
directing
the
state
of
ohio
to
revise
its
laws.
this
is
really
what
i'm
saying
and
perhaps
i
should've
given
that
answer
to
justice
fortas.
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
as
much
direction
as
any
other
form
of
direction.
and
with
the
ohio
legislative
service
commission,
these
are
laws
that
were
adopted
back
in
1948.
there's
no
question
in
my
mind
right
now
that
upon
proper
order
of
the
ohio
general
assembly
would
be
delighted
to
bring
its
laws
up-to-date
like
the
laws
of
every
other
state.
mr.
david
j.
young
not,
not
by
our
law
firm
your
honor.
we
were
retained
on
july
23,
1968.
mr.
david
j.
young
well,
this
puts
in
a
rather
funny
position
when
we
were
in
the
lower
court
we
had
two
situations.
we
had
two
cases,
one
group
of
plaintiffs
attacked
the
law
right
away
back
in
january
of
1968
without
trying
to
get
petitions.
and
they
were
met
with
the
argument,
hey,
you
should've
going
out
and
try
to
get
petitions
before
you
came
in
to
court.
now,
on
the
other
hand,
we
went
out
and
got
petitions
and
came
in
the
court
and
they
said,
you
should've
filed
your
lawsuit
earlier
so
no
matter
which
way
we
went,
the
state
of
ohio,
i
think
--
mr.
david
j.
young
no,
pardon
me.
in
these
laws,
we
have
two
lawsuits,
the
socialist
labor
and
the
wallace
case.
mr.
david
j.
young
the
socialist
labor
case
was
filed
in
january
of
1968.
and
ours
was
filed
on
july
29,
1968.
so,
we
have
the
two
extremes
that
one
situation
of
a
lawsuit
having
been
filed
early
and
one
in
july
29,
so
it
seems
to
us
that
there
certainly
was
adequate
notice
and
time
to
defend
in
this
case.
mr.
david
j.
young
when
the
time
for
filing
this
lawsuit
came
about
the
ohio
supreme
court
was
not
in
session.
it
has
been
my
personal
experience
that
they
are
not
able
to
get
back
as
quickly
as
has
been
accomplished
in
this
case.
we
fear
that
first
of
all
--
mr.
david
j.
young
in
february,
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
were
attempting
to
comply
a
substantially
as
possible
with
the
ohio
laws.
mr.
david
j.
young
yes,
we
certainly
do
but
in
this
case,
in
february
of
1968
the
plaintiffs
were
operating
under
the
assumption
that
if
they
proceeded
forward
and
obtained
15%
signatures
that
they
would
get
ballot
position
for
the
candidate.
mr.
david
j.
young
if
i
were
in
the
case
then
i
might
have
advise
them
a
little
differently.
mr.
david
j.
young
but
at
that
time
there's
no
question
in
the
world.
but
what
they
were
doing
was
proceeding
on
the
assumption
that
they
could
meet
ohio
law.
in
ohio
law
when
we
say
it's
a
wrong
assumption
is
the
most
confusing
set
of
election
laws
that
you
ever
--
i
mean
it's
just
utterly
impossible
almost
--
mr.
david
j.
young
please?
mr.
david
j.
young
sometimes
the
legislatures
win
and
in
this
case
they
did
over
some.
mr.
david
j.
young
yes,
there
are
two
early
requirements
in
to
get
ballot
position
in
a
case
like
this
if
one
uses
the
new
political
party
technique.
one
of
them,
one
has
to
file
or
a
subversive
kind
of
affidavit
and
then
there's
an
investigation
and
hearing
to
make
sure
that
these
people
are
non-subversives
and
this
was
done
in
this
case.
the
material
was
presented
to
the
secretary
of
state
back
in,
i
think
it
was
may
and
the
secretary
of
state
conducted
an
investigation
and
certified
this
new
political
party
pursuant
to
that
provision
of
the
law.
mr.
david
j.
young
the
petition
that
was
prepared
for
circulation
in
this
case
did
they
make
provisions
for
the
calling
of
a
state
convention
and
holding
of
a
national
convention.
by
the
same
token,
it
gave
alternatives
the
possibility
of
delegating
the
power
to
call
the
state
convention
to
three
people
named
in
the
petition
as
distinguished
from
first
electing
county
chairman
in
all
of
the
counties
throughout
the
state
having
them
to
party
functionaries.
the
petitioners
delegated
the
right
to
call
such
a
convention
to
the
three
people
named
in
the
petition.
mr.
david
j.
young
yes,
the
secretary
of
state
would
not
accept
that
in
this
letter.
by
july
--
no,
wait
a
second,
by
the
middle
of
july
of
this
year,
the
petitioners
in
this
case
had
somewhere
between
300,000
and
350,000
signatures
and
it
appeared
quite
clear
to
them
that
they
would
have
no
difficulty
getting
the
--
an
excess
of
433,000.
at
that
time,
a
request
was
made
of
the
secretary
of
state
of
ohio,
if
we
meet
this
signature
requirement
we'll
be
placed
on
the
ballot.
and
one
of
the
things
that
he
noted
was
that
this
new
party
could
not
call
a
state
convention
which
would
he
select
electors
and
the
reason
he
said
that
they
couldn't
call
a
state
convention
it's
because
the
ohio
statutes
require
existing
office
(inaudible)
attendees
at
the
convention
who
are
apportioned
based
upon
this
party's
vote
at
the
last
election
and
this
is
what
the
ohio
laws
provide.
so
you
see,
--
he's
saying
that
you
haven't
had
and
you
aren't
going
to
have
a
convention
and
you
don't
have
people
that
can
attend
the
convention.
therefore,
you
cannot
certify
electors
to
me.
so,
this
was
one
of
the
reasons
provided
by
the
secretary
of
state
for
refusing.
so,
he
took
the
position
that
our
form
of
holding
a
convention
would
not
satisfy
ohio
law.
mr.
david
j.
young
well,
first
of
all
it
seems
to
me
that
we
did
not
have
in
this
case
a
question
of
interpretation
of
state
laws.
once
you
understand
them,
they
do
bar
ballot
position.
that
seems
to
me
that
plaintiffs
have
a
decision
of
whether
to
seek
relief
in
the
federal
or
in
the
state
court.
quite
frankly,
i
would
have
advice
in
any
given
time
to
file
a
lawsuit
such
as
this
before
three-judge
federal
court.
it
has
been
a
traditional
forum
as
of
late
for
these
kinds
of
cases
and
i
see
no
--
since
it
was
not
--
since
we
don't
have
an
interpretation
of
state
law
question
but
really
a
constitutionally
--
validity
of
state
law.
i
personally
see
no
objection
to
the
federal
court
forum.
mr.
david
j.
young
i
am
in
somewhat
of
a
difficult
position
justice
warren
because
we
did
--
when
you
say
may,
we
came
into
the
case
july
the
23rd
and
filed
it
six
days
later.
(voice
overlap)
my
predecessors
have
filed
it.
mr.
david
j.
young
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
when
they
first
became
convinced
that
regardless
of
whether
they
accomplished
this
petition
requirement
or
not
that
they
would
not
get
on
the
ballot.
you
see
they
went
for,
what
they
first
started
out
they
were
organized
--
this
party
was
organized
in
january
of
1968.
it
recognized
that
the
method
of
nominating
petition
had
been
denied
in
ohio.
you
couldn't
get
on
the
ballot
by
independent
nominating
petition;
i
think
it
could
in
other
states.
mr.
david
j.
young
no,
question
about
that.
mr.
david
j.
young
no
question
about
that.
mr.
david
j.
young
that's
correct.
mr.
david
j.
young
i
think
when
you
look
at
the
posture
--
mr.
david
j.
young
i
don't
think
--
i
think
that
there
would've
been
as
much
confusion
then
as
there
would've
been
when
we
filed
a
lawsuit
but
any
petitioning
group
that's
trying
to
accomplish
ballot
position,
it
seems
to
me
files
itself
in
the
posture
of
doing
everything
possible
to
go
about
it
and
getting
all
the
ballot
without
filing
a
lawsuit.
i
mean
this,
any
candidate
throughout
the
country
is
really
trying
to
accomplish
its
political
objectives
and
if
they
can
get
on
the
ballot
usually
by
using
an
alternate
as
is
the
case
in
many
other
states.
there
are
the
states
that
have
denied
independent
nominating
petition
but
turn
around
and
give
you
a
political
party
method,
it's
practically
the
same
or
it's
attainable.
these
people
apparently
thought,
i
say
apparently
because
i
wasn't
there
then,
apparently
thought,
we
can
meet
the
15%
even
though
it's
--
even
though
it's
burdensome
we've
got
our
strength
to
meet
the
15%
and
i
assume
that's
why
they
went
forward
hoping
that
they
could
get
the
15%
and
get
on
the
ballot
and
not
have
to
file
a
lawsuit.
mr.
david
j.
young
from
what
i
can
be
able
to
--
can
gather
as
they
felt
that
they
could
--
mr.
david
j.
young
i
don't
know
what
they
--
mr.
david
j.
young
they
obviously
did
not.
mr.
david
j.
young
it
certainly
was
knowable
at
that
time.
mr.
david
j.
young
it
was
knowable.
mr.
david
j.
young
yes.
mr.
david
j.
young
my
only
answer
can
be
is
that
they
felt
that
they
could
meet
substantial
compliance
with
the
statutes.
they
went
forward
full
steam
ahead
when
they
learned
that
even
with
substantial
compliance
that
they
wouldn't
get
on
the
ballot.
they
filed
a
lawsuit
as
timely
as
possible.
they
filed
a
lawsuit
in
sufficient
time
to
allow
the
court
to
adjudicate
this
case.
the
case
has
been
able
to
come
all
the
way
up
to
the
united
states
supreme
court
in
time
to
grant
relief.
justice
stewart
was
able
to
order
temporary
relief
without
disrupting
the
ohio
ballot.
so,
true,
the
lawsuit
is
late
but
is
it
late
solely
that
400,000
voters
in
ohio's
right
to
suffer
should
be
denied.
i
agreed
that
the
lawsuit
is
late
but
i
don't
think
it's
too
late
to
--
i
don't
think
relief
should
be
denied
just
because
these
people
didn't
file
earlier.
i
don't
think
the
doctrine
of
laches
would
be
applicable
when
we're
talking
about
the
voting
rights
of
an
excessive
400,000
citizens
in
ohio.
mr.
david
j.
young
yes.
mr.
david
j.
young
yes.
mr.
david
j.
young
yes,
it
seems
to
me
that's
precisely
yet.
i
having
found
this
lawsuit
late
made
a
difficult
for
my
friend
sam
lopeman
to
defend
it
i'm
sure.
but
i
don't
think
that
the
rights
of
any
ohio
citizens
have
been
prejudiced
because
temporary
relief
has
been
granted
much
later
than
that.
so,
we
feel
when
you
look
at
this
case
as
question
of
the
rights
of
400,000
--
450,000
voters
the
doctrine
of
laches
would
not
be
applicable.
if
i
could,
i'd
like
to
reserve
just
a
couple
of
minutes
for
rebuttal.
mr.
david
j.
young
yes.
i
myself
and
i
question
into
the
case
i
have
a
writings
communicated
with
ted
brown,
secretary
of
state
and
i
said,
we
have
petitions
if
we
give
you
sufficient
number,
will
you
put
him
on
the
ballot
and
they
said,
no.
the
only
other
--
mr.
david
j.
young
pardon.
when
i
came
in
to
the
case,
--
mr.
david
j.
young
--
i
notified
the
secretary
of
state
of
how
many
signatures
we
had
that
we
could
meet
the
requirements
and
that
if
we
presented
those
petitions
to
him,
would
he
provide
ballot
position.
he
wrote
back
and
said,
no.
then,
we
had
the
quandary,
what
do
we
do
with
these
petitions?
we
notified
opposing
counsel
that
we
have
them,
that
we
have
them
in
our
offices
and,
did
they
want
to
inspect
them?
they
did
not.
we
turned
them
over
to
a
certified
public
accountant
who
could
attest
to
the
accuracy
of
the
numbers
and
no
duplications
and
they
have
been
in
storage
ever
since.
mr.
david
j.
young
i'm
an
attorney
not
a
politician
and
marvin
griffin's
name
should
appear
in
the
ballot.
mr.
david
j.
young
that's
correct.
mr.
david
j.
young
i
will
answer
you
that
we
are
perfectly
satisfied
with
the
order
of
justice
stewart
placing
on
the
ballot
the
names
that
appeared
in
this
order.
we
do
not
seek
to
have
that
order
modified.
mr.
david
j.
young
i
think
i
can
answer
that
by
staring
at
the
back
that
ohio
has
no
requirement
that
the
electors
vote
for
a
person
to
whom
they're
pledged.
mr.
david
j.
young
my
adversary
said
he
wasn't
aware
of
any
statute
until
someone
just
told
him
today.
mr.
david
j.
young
if
there
is
one,
i'd
like
to
see
it
cited
because
i've
never
been
able
to
find
it
and
i
asked
to
his
co-counsel
during
argument
to
send
me
over
the
statutory
provision
because
i
don't
know
the
one
exist.
mr.
david
j.
young
governor
wallace
under
those
circumstances
has
announced
his
position.
he
has
indicated
that
he
would
come
in
--
mr.
david
j.
young
well,
then
i
can't,
--
but
you
are
asking
me
--
i
beg
your
pardon.
it
seems
to
me
a
political
–
legally,
i
can
answer
--
mr.
david
j.
young
no.
mr.
david
j.
young
we
do
not
think
that
would
be
the
legal
effect,
no.
mr.
david
j.
young
yes.
mr.
david
j.
young
yes.
mr.
david
j.
young
now,
if
you
allow
me
this
to
--
mr.
david
j.
young
if
you
allow
me
to
repeat
what
i
have
read
in
the
papers
i'll
be
glad
to
tell
you
that.
i'm
not
a
member
of
this
party;
i
can
tell
you
that
it's
my
understanding
that
governor
wallace
will
commend
the
electors
to
vote
for
curtis
lemay
as
vice
president
of
the
united
states.
mr.
david
j.
young
the
petitioners
who
signed
this
petition
of
450,000
people
gave
to
the
three
men
who
are
named
in
the
petition,
the
authority
to
call
a
state
convention
or
in
the
absence
of
a
state
convention
to
make
the
selection.
a
state
convention
was
scheduled
when
it
was
indicated
the
results
of
that
convention
would
not
be
recognized
then
it
was
exercised
by
the
other
three.
but
a
state
convention
was
called,
was
scheduled
to
be
held
and
the
secretary
of
state
indicated
that
he
would
not
respect
the
results
of
that
convention
and
i
think
this
answers
the
other
point
as
to
whether
all
of
these
other
laws
do
apply
to
third
parties.
exhibit
13
in
the
transcript
shows
that
the
secretary
of
state
said
that's
why
he
didn't
let
them
on
the
ballot
because
of
those
requirements.
so,
and
my
answer
is
that
i
do
not
feel
that
the
electors
in
ohio
were
pledged
that
as
for
the
vice
presidential
candidate
they
could
select
curtis
lemay
rather
than
marvin
griffin
in
ohio.
mr.
david
j.
young
no.
mr.
david
j.
young
this
is
as
a
matter
of
law
i
find
no
--
mr.
david
j.
young
yes.
mr.
david
j.
young
yes,
i
think
they're
free
to
vote
for
whomever
they
please
in
ohio.
in
ray
versus
blair,
this
court
held
that
a
court
could.
i
mean
a
state
could
establish
pledge
requirements
to
participate
in
a
primary.
this
court
left
open
whether
the
question
of
whether
electors
are
really
free
even
if
there
were
such
a
requirement
to
vote
for
whomever
they
seem
fit
but
there's
no
suggestion
it
seems
to
me
in
any
decision
by
this
court
that
if
a
state
has
no
pledge
requirement
that
the
electors
must
vote
for
anyone.
theoretically,
they
could
vote
for
whomever
they
saw
fit.
one
of
the
final
points
that
i
would
like
to
raise
is
the
matter
of
relief
that
was
touched
upon
before.
the
temporary
order
rendered
by
justice
stewart
would,
in
these
appellants'
standpoint
satisfy
the
temporary
problem
that
exists.
it
seems
to
me
we
have
two
problems;
what
about
the
1968
election
and
what
happens
henceforth?
the
order
rendered
by
justice
stewart
has
been
complied
with.
the
secretary
of
state
has
notified
us
that
if
that
order
is
not
changed,
everything
is
ready
to
move
with
the
name
of
governor
wallace
on
the
ballot.
if
this
court
finds
that
it's
difficult
to
render
a
final
decision
as
to
what's
going
to
happen
in
future
elections
prior
to
say
october
the
15th
then
we
would
think
--
seek
a
temporary
order
affirming
that
what
has
been
accomplished
by
justice
stewart
for
the
1968
election
because
that
has
already
complied
with.
mr.
david
j.
young
oh!
no,
no
sir.
mr.
david
j.
young
there're
no
--
you
made
that
perfectly
clearly
to
us
and
the
order
does
that
this
court
is
free
to
order
governor
wallace
off
the
ballot
but
what
i'm
saying
is
that
all
steps
have
been
taken
and
if
no
other
order
for
example
of
this
court
were
rendered
he
would
be
on
the
ballot
in
the
november
1968
presidential
election.
i
know
the
court
is
troubled
by
the
fact
that
we
did
not
file
this
case
sooner.
the
only
thing
i
can
say
is
that
under
the
old
law
that
was
changed,
38
days
after
we
filed
our
case
these
people
could
have
gotten
on
the
ballot
with
29,000
signatures
as
compared
to
452,000.
in
other
words,
if
these
laws
hadn't
been
changed
38
days
after
we
filed
our
lawsuit,
they
still
could've
gotten
on
the
ballot
in
ohio
with
only
29,000
signatures.
mr.
david
j.
young
independent
candidate,
yes.
mr.
david
j.
young
yes.
under
the
old
law
that
existed
--
mr.
david
j.
young
pre-1948,
sixty
days
before
the
election
with
1%
of
the
signatures
someone
could
get
on
the
ballot.
mr.
david
j.
young
that's
correct,
yes.
and
this
was
the
method
first
sought
in
ohio
by
these
people
and
when
it
was
foreclosed
then
they
moved
in
the
political
party
direction.
mr.
david
j.
young
that's
--
except
to
the
indirect
--
mr.
david
j.
young
yes,
before
1948,
all
of
the
parties
used
the
independent
nominating
petition
technique
because
that
provided
that
even
though
you
were
technically
an
independent
candidate
you'd
put
a
label.
so,
all
of
the
political
parties
in
ohio
before
1948
used
the
independent
nominating
petition
technique
but
they
were
allowed
to
put
a
label
next
to
the
name.
so,
that's
how
there
was
this
free
--
there
was
this
flourishing
of
independent
parties
under
the
prior
system.
just
a
final
point,
i
see
my
time
is
up,
i
do
hope
this
case
is
not
decided
on
the
basis
that
it
is
possible
to
get
on
the
ballot
in
ohio.
this
group
had
over
2,700,000
throughout
the
country,
450,000
signatures
in
ohio
at
adequate
strength
that
comply
with
any
kind
of
a
requirement
and
it
isn't
a
question
of
time,
i've
cited
in
my
brief
but
there's
just
no
way.
they're
completely
barred
from
these
statutes
and
i
hope
whatever
decision
is
rendered
is
rendered
on
recognition
that
independent
and
third
party
candidates
are
barred
and
barred
effectively
from
participating
in
presidential
elections
in
ohio.
i
hope
that
at
least
as
far
as
the
temporary
relief
by
october
the
15th,
we
can
receive
an
order
confirming
the
order
of
justice
stewart
and
that
the
situation
by
order
of
this
court
or
upon
remand
will
ultimately
be
cleared
up
in
ohio
so
that
will
have
free
elections
not
--
mr.
david
j.
young
because
there
are
two
questions
before
the
court,
the
matter
of
temporary
relief
and
ultimate
relief.
mr.
lopeman's
statement
suggested
to
me
that
unless
you
order
his
name
off
the
ballot
by
october
the
15th,
they're
going
to
have
a
hard
time
taking
it
off.
so,
it
seems
to
me
you
got
a
time
pressure
on
the
temporary
question
before
you
but
not
as
much
time
pressure
on
the
ultimate
relief
question
of
how
do
we
handle
all
the
future
elections
in
ohio.
mr.
david
j.
young
yes,
yes
as
--
mr.
david
j.
young
i
don't
think
it's
necessary
for
the
court
to
make
that
adjudication
because
even
the
name
appearing
on
the
ballot
as
it
does
now
with
the
label
would
be
much
the
same
as
the
old
technique
that
we
used
in
ohio.
mr.
david
j.
young
i
probably
go
way
please
it
with
the
temporary
relief
that
we've
received.
mr.
david
j.
young
well,
--
mr.
david
j.
young
here's
the
situation
you
have
before
you
is
that
the
lower
court
all
three
judges
of
the
federal
district
court
below
found
ohio's
laws
were
unconstitutional.
they
were
unconstitutional
insofar
as
they
denied
ballot
position
to
independent
candidates
and
to
third
party
candidates.
and
you
have
--
mr.
david
j.
young
they
did
say
that
but
they
also
declared
these
laws
to
be
unconstitutional.
i
don't
think
this
court
would
apply
laches
to
millions
of
voters
in
this
cause
no
one's
hurt.
i
mean
laches
is
a
balancing
of
interest.
who
on
the
one
hand
is
hurt
as
compared
with
taking
the
right
of
suffrage
away
from
these
100,000
of
voters?
mr.
david
j.
young
the
district
court
did
decide
that
that
they
have
rights,
that
they
had
equal
protection
rights
and
that
the
state
of
ohio
has
violated
the
equal
protection
law
of
cause
when
it
denied
ballot
position
to
independent
third
party
candidates.
mr.
david
j.
young
i
just
have
a
strong
belief
that
this
court
will
decide
rights
do
exists
under
these
circumstances.
i'm
rather
shock
by
the
contentions
i
hear
that
they
do
not
and
i
feel
comfort
this
court
will
find
some
rights
no
matter
what
the
outcome
is.
thank
you
very
kindly.
mr.
david
j.
young
no,
your
honor
because
we
do
not
have
this.
mr.
david
j.
young
i
was
told
by
my
co-counsel
that
he
believe
there
was.
it
is
my
understanding
now
that
there
is
a
requirement
in
ohio
that
presidential
electors
at
the
time
they
are
certified
to
the
secretary
of
state
from
the
state
political
convent
--
party
convention
are
required
to
pled
that
they
will
vote
for
the
candidate
of
the
party.
i
think
that
is
the
only
limitation
and
again
i
would
--
mr.
david
j.
young
that's
correct.
mr.
david
j.
young
i
don't
believe
there
is
now,
i'm
going
back
and
forth
but
this
is
my
understanding
knowing
everything
that
i
know
about
it.
mr.
david
j.
young
yes,
your
honor
if
this
--
mr.
david
j.
young
i
would
think
that
it
would
be
up
to
the
order
of
this
court;
i
don't
know
what
it
is.
we
have
departed
from
ohio
election
law.
we're
way
passed,
we're
nine
months
passed
ohio
election
law
and
i
can't
answer
that
question.
you
have
to
answer
