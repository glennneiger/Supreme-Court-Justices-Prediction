justice
byron
r.
white
well,
on
your
scheme
of
things
i
take
it
the
write-in
--
does
it
satisfy
any
right
by
itself?
but
i
take
it
you
asked
for
it
separately.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
guess
you
didn't.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
your
position
that
the
write-in
that
the
state
could
constitutionally
dispense
for
the
write-in?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
not
by
itself?
justice
byron
r.
white
don't
you
have
to
win
this
point
to
win
your
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
unconstitutionality
of
the
15%.
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
those
others
were
bad.
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
they
were
bad,
the
other
aspects
of
it,
it
would
still
leave
to
15%?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
you
didn't
get
the
15%
end
of
the
time,
didn't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
will
you
see
to
concede
now
as
i
read
your
briefs
that
15%
would
have
to
be
in
before
the
primary?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
did
i
read
you
incorrectly?
i
thought
you
agreed
that
that
was
a
proper
interpretation
of
the
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
under
stand
that
but
let's
assume
all
the
other
provisions
about
a
third
party
were
unconstitutional.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
ohio
came
back
and
said,
but
we
can
see
these
other
provisions
unconstitutional
but
the
15%
requirement
before
the
primary
is
all
illegal
and
this
party
didn't
satisfy
that
so
no
relief.
justice
byron
r.
white
then
you
have
to
get
to
that,
don't
you?
if
the
court
said
that
the
statement
was
entitle
to
force
candidates
to
go
through
to
a
party,
the
party
process
then
you
would
have
to
win
on
the
15%?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
that's
based
on
these
other
provisions
about
the
party.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
you
would've
--
you
would've
had
to
worry?
let's
assume
if
ohio
had
said
these
other
provisions
are
wholly
unreasonable
we
want
to
apply
them
to
you
but
you
still
have
to
get
your
petition
in
before
the
primary
you
wouldn't
satisfy
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
that
you're
very
clear
--
now,
that
you're
clear,
what's
your
position
is,
could
the
legislature
to
say
to
the
voters,
we're
going
to
delegate
you
--
we're
going
to
share
this
power
with
you
but
you're
not
going
to
get
it
at
all.
we
are
going
to
let
you
choose
between
--
to
choose
between
the
candidate
of
the
republican
party
and
the
candidate
of
the
democratic
party.
justice
byron
r.
white
although
the
legislature
could
say,
to
pass
along
and
say
the
electors
shall
be
chosen
by
the
legislature
of
the
state
that
they
shall
be
chosen
as
between
the
electors
for
democratic
party
and
the
republican
party
and
each
year,
each
presidential
year
the
legislature
just
chooses
between
the
candidates
of
two
parties.
justice
byron
r.
white
when
did
the
state
of
ohio
say
that
to
you
about
filing,
was
there
another
lawsuit,
was
there
a
lawsuit
that
was
filed?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
at
that
very
point,
if
you
wanted
to
challenge
the
state's
assistance
that
should
be
a
party
rather
than
an
independent
candidate
you
could've
filed
right
then.
i
mean
that
is
perfectly
fair
that
you
have
to
be
a
party,
you
couldn't
petition
yourself
on
to
the
ballot.
that
was
clear
wasn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
there
are
also
nothing
--
there's
nothing
vague
about
there
being
no
write-in?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
these
--
and
also
there
was
no
question
but
--
that
what
if
you
were
going
to
be
a
party
that
you
have
to
be
a
party
and
there
was
no
question
that
you
had
to
get
15%?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
could've
raised
these
questions
very
early.
justice
byron
r.
white
without
any
confusion
whatsoever.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
it's
just
in
this
one
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
the
others
should
be
otherwise
in
the
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
as
i
understood
it,
it
was
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
it's
a
matter
of
fact
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
he
is
the
vice
presidential
candidate,
is
he?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
guess
he
is
for
purposes
of
the
independent
party
and
--
in
ohio.
those
electors
if
mr.
wallace
carried
the
state
of
ohio
the
electors
would
have
to
go
to
the
electoral
college
and
vote
for
mr.
griffin?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
don't
think
ohio
electors
about?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
the
ohio
law
say
though?
doesn't
the
ohio
law
purport
to
bind
electors
to
vote
for
the
candidate
of
their
party?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
under
ohio
law
an
elector
maybe
free
to
vote
in
the
electoral
college
for
anybody
he
wants
to?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
have
to
go
that
far
now
even
if
the
rest
of
the
provisions
are
invalid,
they
didn't
satisfy
that
very
personal,
don't
you
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
not
the
point.
how
about
the
point
that
made
--
that
the
best
of
these
cases
were
invalid,
it
doesn't
have
that
motion
to
file
(inaudible)?
is
there
section
in
the
rank
in
between
these
provisions
that
if
these
other
provisions
were
invalid
the
name
was
--
wouldn't
have
to
be
filed
until
90
days
before
november
whatever
the
date
is?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
at
least
the
provision
requiring
primary
would
be
reasonable
you
say.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
would
you
think
if
this
was
--
if
today
were
the
last
day
the
court
could
decide
this
case
and
still
get
the
name
off
the
ballot
if
it
decided
against
your
position?
what
if
these
were
the
last
day
such
as
do
you
say
that
suggesting
as
the
15th
as
last
day?
suppose
this
one
is
the
last
day
and
we
just
--
after
we
confer
this,
this
is
how
we
can
do
it?
it's
a
question,
too
difficult
to
decide
one
day
and
write
up.
justice
byron
r.
white
uh-huh,
i
thought
you
would
be.
what
would
you
suppose
going
to
happen
to
the
temporary
relief
in
that
respect
if
we
can't
--
justice
byron
r.
white
because
it
could
be
you
know
that
we
might
not
be
able
to
decide
this
case
and
we,
who
knows.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
said
you've
waited
too
long,
they
didn't
want
to
--
they
said
among
other
things
they
said
laches
among
other
things,
didn't
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
that
assumes
that
they
got
some
rights,
that's
the
question
you've
got
here
(voice
overlap).
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
that's
either
their
decisions
been
appealed
up
here
and
i
just
and
let's
assume
there's
no
enough
time
to
decide
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
can
you
print
and
program
machines
in
29
days?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
many
--
what
percent
of
the
voters
in
the
state
of
ohio
are
going
to
vote
on
machine?
justice
byron
r.
white
all
for
the
whole
state?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
percentage
of
all
the
voters
in
ohio
are
going
to
vote
through
machines
one
way
or
another?
justice
byron
r.
white
75%?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
can't
take
the
one
of
those,
can
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
really
are
as
mr.
justice
black
suggests
the
claim
very
--
come
very
close
to
claim
in
absolute
right
to
be
on
the
ballot?
justice
byron
r.
white
right,
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
elector
could
--
these
days,
the
right
to
choose
the
electors?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
don't
think
that
legislature
could
permit
the
choice
we
make
between
a
and
b,
and
between
a,
b,
c,
and
d?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
don't
you
think
if
they
take
the
ballots,
they
have
got
them
printed?
justice
byron

white
well,
on
your
scheme
of
things
i
take
