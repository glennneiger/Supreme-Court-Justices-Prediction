justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
young,
the
right
and
i
gather
is
only
of
the
candidate's
name,
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
is
this
affect
or
accomplish
a
vote
for
electors?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
they
have
been
certified?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
young,
can
you
suggest
any
occasion
when
this
court
has
ever
directed
a
legislature,
adopt
the
particular
kind
of
law?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
all
has
been
done,
set
aside
is
not
properly
apportioned
with
the
suggestion
that
if
it's
not
coming
by
the
state
but
then
the
court
might
set
up
a
basis.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
these
in
light
of
the
fact
mean
that
under
justice
stewart's
order
there
is
in
fact
an
existence
the
ballots
which
contain
the
designation.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
unless
for
other
reasons
that
designation
should
be
deleted.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
your
point
is
that
laches
can't
defeat
your
right
to
have
the
designation
in
the
ballot.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
but
hypothetical
is
that
the
provision
requiring
a
primary
in
the
ohio
law
is
unconstitutional.
if
that
were
true
if
we
were
to
conclude
that
it
was
unconstitutional,
what
then
of
the
fact
that
they
did
actually
get
the
15%
of
signatures
but
they
did
not
get
them
until
after
that
february
date?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
because
as
i
understand
your
adversary
he
argues
that
if
all
these
provisions
keyed
to
the
primary
are
unconstitutional.
now,
then
the
15%
requirement
should
be
read
as
satisfied
so
long
as
the
signatures
be
collected
90
days
before
the
general
election.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
may
i
ask
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
if
they
has
the
citation
to
any
ohio
statute
that
binds
the
electors
to
the
names
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
didn't
you
tell
us
earlier
that
there
was
such
a
statute?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that
would
not
apply
here
in
this
instance,
in
this
situation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
there
is
no
statute?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
excuse
me
mr.
gordon,
i
gather
we
have
the
practical
problem
here
that
your
client
is
not
beneficiary
of
the
interim
relief
of
the
appellants
in
the
previous
case
received
so
that
what
is
the
situation
if
you
would've
prevail,
what
is
--
are
there
any
opportunity
as
i
understand
the
previous
argument
probably
there
isn't
to
get
you
on
the
ballot
now?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know,
i
say
the
practical
finding
is
that
you
are
not
on
these
ballots
which
we
are
advised,
they
have
now
been
prepared
that
have
the
american
independent
party
name.
you
are
not
named
by
any
ballot,
presently?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
there
is
a
practical
problem
of
how
before
election
there
can
be
printed
if
you
prevail
and
distributed
the
ballots
with
the
name
of
your
party
--
your
client
on
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
don't
we
have
that
problem?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now
what
as
a
practical
matter,
what
support
do
you
have
for
the
statement
that
there's
ample
of
time
now
to
print
ballots
with
name
of
the
socialist
labor
party
on
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
lopeman,
didn't
the
court
below
treat
it
though
as
a
case
for
that
relief
you
sought?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
my
question
was,
i
have
read
that
opinion
somewhere
but
i
thought
that
the
court
below
treated
the
application
of
the
socialist
labor
party
as
also
asking
for
ballot
position,
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you
may
be
right,
i
somehow
read
that
opinion.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
how
about
the
practical
problem
mr.
lopeman?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
young,
the
right
and
i
gather
is
only
of
the
candidate's
name,
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
is
this
affect
or
accomplish
a
vote
for
electors?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
they
have
been
certified?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
young,
can
you
suggest
any
occasion
when
this
court
has
ever
directed
a
legislature,
adopt
the
particular
kind
of

justice
william
j.

that's

is

justice
william

mr.
chief

may
i
ask
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
if
they
has
the
citation
to
any
ohio
statute
that
binds
the
electors
to
the

--
