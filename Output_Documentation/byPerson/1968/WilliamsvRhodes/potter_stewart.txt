justice
potter
stewart
mr.
young.
justice
potter
stewart
we're
dealing
here
only
with
the
offices
of
president
and
vice
president
of
the
united
states
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
more
specifically
with
the
election
of
electors,
are
we
not?
justice
potter
stewart
not
with
senatorial
or
congressional
candidate?
justice
potter
stewart
where
is
that
apparatus,
butler
county?
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
do
concede
mr.
young,
do
you
not
that
because
of
the
interrelationship
and
interoperation
of
the
various
ohio
election
statute
the
word
“election”
does
mean
primary
election
under
ohio
laws,
don't
you?
it's
not
attacking
this
as
being
unconstitutionally
vague
or
anything
like
that,
are
you?
justice
potter
stewart
but
in
this
case
so
far
as
what
the
requirements
of
ohio
statute
say
they
are,
you're
not
questioning
that
they
do
require
the
signatures
to
be
filed
90
days
before
the
primary
election.
that's
one
of
the
things
you're
objecting
to.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
young,
we
are
dealing
here
of
course
with
the
constitutional
issue
and
i
suppose
you
would
agree
that
one
wouldn't
begin
with
the
fourteenth
amendment
in
this
case
but
rather
one
would
begin
at
least
with
section
1
of
article
ii
of
the
constitution,
wouldn't
you?
justice
potter
stewart
and
with
the
twelfth
amendment?
justice
potter
stewart
and
what
does
--
justice
potter
stewart
shall
appoint.
each
state
shall
appoint.
justice
potter
stewart
shall
appoint.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
constitutional
provision
that
you
and
i
now
talking
about,
you
didn't
--
it
goes
on
and
say
and
it
says,
each
state
shall
appoint
in
such
manner
as
the
legislature
thereof
may
direct
in
a
number
of
electors.
you
would
concede
i
suppose
that
the
--
a
state
today
could
constitutionally
provide
through
its
legislature
that
its
electors
be
named
by
the
state
legislature,
would
you?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
we're
dealing
--
we
deal
here
with
a
written
constitution
and
then
in
this
respect
the
constitution
is
very
explicit
that
says,
each
state
shall
appoint
in
such
manner
as
the
legislature
thereof
may
direct
a
number
of
electors.
justice
potter
stewart
apparently,
they
must
begin
with
that,
must
we,
in
consideration
of
the
issues
before
us
in
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
on
a
katzenbach
case
first
of
all
the
--
we
were
dealing
i
think
with
an
act
of
congress
which
we
don't
have
here.
and
secondly,
we
were
not
dealing,
i
think
with
this
explicit
provision
of
the
constitution
not
giving
permission
to
the
states
but
saying
--
setting
forth
explicitly
how
the
electors
shall
be
chosen
by
the
states
and
they
shall
be
chosen,
they
shall
be
appointed
as
the
state
legislature
may
direct.
justice
potter
stewart
those
are
two
very
obvious
and
evident
first
blush
differences
between
this
case
and
the
katzenbach
case,
aren't
they
or
am
i
mistaken?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
of
course
the
protections
of
such
and
such
and
such
and
such
didn't
exist
at
the
time
this
was
written
because
they
didn't
come
along
with
1860's
after
the
civil
war.
but
certainly,
before
the
post
civil
war
alterations
in
the
united
states
constitution
it
would've
been
clear
i
suppose
would
it
not
that
under
the
second
clause,
section
1
of
article
ii
of
the
constitution,
you
wouldn't
have
any
case
at
all.
you
wouldn't
have
any
argument
either,
would
you?
justice
potter
stewart
before
the
thirteenth,
fourteenth,
and
fifteenth
amendments.
justice
potter
stewart
and
so
the
question
is
here
really,
is
it
not
how
much
if
that
all
the
post
civil
war
amendments
have
modified
the
explicit
provisions
of
the
second
clause
of
section
1
of
article
ii?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
1892.
justice
potter
stewart
statutes
--
well,
who's
not
permissible
--
it's
not
for
us
of
course
to
judge
the
wisdom
or
the
policy
or
the
good
sense
of
the
ohio
legislature
but
simply
whether
or
not
its
action
is
constitutional
and
it's
not
permissible
under
what
provision
of
the
constitution
is
my
question.
justice
potter
stewart
which
part
of
the
fourteenth
amendment?
justice
potter
stewart
you
don't
rely
on
the
first
amendment?
justice
potter
stewart
but
mr.
lopeman,
i
suppose
we
should
be
bothered
by
the
urgency
of
this
matter,
should
we
not?
can
you
tell
us
to
the
point
of
view
simply
of
the
mechanics
of
the
states
carrying
out
its
--
in
state
officials
carrying
out
their
duties
in
order
to
run
a
proper
election
in
the
state
of
ohio
including
absentee
voters
and
sick
voters
and
military
votes,
overseas
and
so
on.
how
soon
the
state
will
need
to
know
the
decision
of
this
court
whatever
it
may
be
in
order
to
carryout
the
(voice
overlap)
ohio
election.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
a
week
from
today?
justice
potter
stewart
a
week
from
tomorrow,
i
guess.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
lopeman,
i
have
so
much
more
practical
and
mechanical
sort
of
a
question.
the
interim
relief
that
i
granted
last
month
as
i
remember
required
the
state
of
ohio
for
the
time
being
to
put
on
the
ballot
the
names
of
the
american
independent
party
and
george
wallace
and
a
man
by
the
name
of
griffin.
well
now,
i
read
the
papers
every
now
and
griffin
wouldn't
seem
to
be
the
right
name
now,
would
it?
would
this
require
reprinting
whatever
the
court's
decision
is
in
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it's
a
--
some
importance
i
suppose
that
we
tried
to
know
what
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
name
on
there
if
for
vice
presidential
candidate
is
griffin,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
right.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that
was
decided
in
ray
against
blair,
wasn't
it?
that
question
if
i
understand
the
question
you're
raising.
that
was
the
case
and
which
alabama
did
require
by
state
law
that
the
electors
vote
for
the
national
candidates
of
their
party
and
this
court
in
ray
against
blair
and
opinion
by
mr.
justice
reed
and
all
of
that
did
not
violate
either
article
ii,
section
1
or
(voice
overlap).
justice
potter
stewart
but
is
there
a
provision
of
ohio
law
which
purports
to
require
electors
pledge
to
a
certain
presidential
candidate
to
vote
for
him?
justice
potter
stewart
how
about
a
national
convention
that's
another
requirement
and
these
i
suppose
there's
no
way
on
earth
that
even
all
the
people
in
ohio
could
require
party
to
have
a
national
convention,
that
would
take
cooperation
from
people
in
other
states,
wouldn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
but
you're
not
--
for
a
moment
suggesting
that
that's
a
reversal,
are
you?
justice
potter
stewart
you
mean
it's
your
understanding
it
certainly
my
understanding
that
the
state
could
with
equal
convenience
and
he
is
complied
with
an
order
which
would
in
fact
affirm
the
action
of
the
district
court?
justice
potter
stewart
was
that
as
a
party
or
just
a
candidate?
justice
potter
stewart
independent
candidate?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
pre-1948?
justice
potter
stewart
as
a
candidate?
justice
potter
stewart
the
laws
and
actually
after
1948
simply
limited
independent
candidates,
they
didn't
really
affect
the
laws
applicable
to
parties,
do
they?
justice
potter
stewart
if
that
was
i
know
that
you
could
no
longer
be
an
independent,
the
only
way
you
could
be
a
candidate
on
a
ballot
would
be
through
the
party
machinery?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
gordon,
we
are
all
throwing
around
the
word
“rights”
around
here
--
rights,
rights.
i
understand
ohio's
argument
in
the
previous
case
as
to
the
source
of
the
right
it
asserts
correctly
or
incorrectly,
it
cites
article
ii,
section
1
of
the
united
states
constitution.
now,
what
are
you
doing?
what
source
are
you
talking
about
for
these
“rights”?
justice
potter
stewart
because
i
presume
you're
talking
about
some
asserted
constitutional
right
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
federal
constitutional
right,
from
where?
justice
potter
stewart
at
clear
where
you
get
these
guidelines
from
the
district
court's
--
justice
potter
stewart
no,
you
know
wesberry
against
sanders,
reynolds
against
sims
have
nothing
to
do
with
parties
on
the
ballot?
justice
potter
stewart
and
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
electoral
college?
justice
potter
stewart
we
talk
about
time
for
printing.
there's
also
a
matter
of
getting
ballots
over
to
southeast
asia
and
back
and
then
to
the
hospitals
around
the
country
for
sick
absentee
voters
and
various
other
considerations
in
addition
to
printing.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
lopeman,
i
want
into
this
pretty
carefully
some
time
ago
and
i
would
agree
with
you
at
the
extent
that
it's
rather
ambiguous
as
to
what
they
asked.
they
recite
in
the
body
of
their
complaint
their
desire
against
such
relief,
i
would
agree
with
you
of
their
prayer
is
not
very
clear.
i
don't
have
it
in
front
of
me
but
as
i
finally
understood
it,
it
was
rather
a
conditional
prayer.
they
asked
first
that
the
legislature
be
directed
or
be
given
an
opportunity
to
do
something
about
this
and
then
they
said,
if
the
legislature
fails
to
act
then
we
ask
the
court
to
give
us
that
really,
was
that
about
right?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
not
a
condition?
justice
potter
stewart
you
haven't
taken
a
cross
appeal
from
that?
justice
potter
stewart
you
haven't
appeal
that
although
and
suppose
in
strict
logic
your
position
is
you
could've,
you
have?
justice
potter
stewart
but
so
you're
asking
us
to
affirm
that
--
the
district
court's
order
refusing
to
give
party
designation
not
for
the
reasons
that
the
district
court
said
necessarily
but
also
alternatively
for
an
addition
for
the
reason
that
the
district
court
was
wrong
about
the
unconstitutionality
of
the
ohio
statute.
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
this
court
didn't
give
them
the
right
to
women?
justice
potter
stewart
part
of
this
court
gave
negroes
the
right
to
vote,
that's
in
the
fifteenth
amendment?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
gordon,
what
do
you
say
to
the
representation
--
professional
representation
by
the
representative
of
the
attorney
general
of
ohio
that
it's
now
a
simple
impossibility
to
give
you
the
relief
that
you
asked
for
1968
and
i'm
not
now
talking
about
your
laches
perhaps
it's
all
my
fault
but
we're
dealing
with
the
fact
not
a
theory
as
he
represents
it
us,
what
do
you
say
on
that?
justice
potter
stewart
did
they
which
is
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
at
the
very
least
then,
you
would
require
these
counties
that
have
--
that
vote
by
voting
machines
to
turn
by
--
to
turn
the
paper
ballots
to
satisfy,
you
really
if
you
ask,
is
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
for
a
total
disruption
of
the
electoral
process
and
all?
justice
potter
stewart
it
still
represented
to
us
professionally
as
a
fact
that
there
is
not
time,
that
it's
impossible
to
do.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
young.
justice
potter
stewart
we're
dealing
here
only
with
the
offices
of
president
and
vice
president
of
the
united
states
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
more
specifically
with
the
election
of
electors,
are
we
not?
justice
potter
stewart
not
with
senatorial
or
congressional
candidate?
justice
potter
stewart
where
is
that
apparatus,
butler
county?
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
do
concede
mr.
young,
do
you
not
that
because
of
the
interrelationship
and
interoperation
of
the
various
ohio
election
statute
the
word
“election”
does
mean
primary
election
under
ohio
laws,
don't
you?
it's
not
attacking
this
as
being
unconstitutionally
vague
or
anything
like
that,
are
you?
justice
potter
stewart
but
in
this
case
so
far
as
what
the
requirements
of
ohio
statute
say
they
are,
you're
not
questioning
that
they
do
require
the
signatures
to
be
filed
90
days
before
the
primary
election.
that's
one
of
the
things
you're
objecting
to.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
young,
we
are
dealing
here
of
course
with
the
constitutional
issue
and
i
suppose
you
would

that

would
begin
at

with

of
the
constitution,
wouldn't
you?
justice
potter
stewart
and
with
the
twelfth

justice
potter
stewart
and
what
does
--
justice
potter
stewart
shall
appoint.
each
state
shall
appoint.
justice
potter
stewart
shall
appoint.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
constitutional
provision
that
you
and
i
now
talking
about,
you
didn't
--
it
goes
on
and
say
and
it
says,
each
state
shall
appoint
in
such
manner
as
the
legislature
thereof

you
would
concede
i
suppose
that
the
--
a
state
today
could
constitutionally
provide
through
its
legislature
that
its
electors
be
named
by
the
state
legislature,
would
you?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
we're

with

apparently,
they
must
begin
with
that,
must
we,
in
consideration
of
the
issues
before
us
in
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
on
a
katzenbach
case
first
of
all
the
--
we
were
dealing
i
think
with
an
act
of
congress
which
we
don't
have
here.
and
secondly,
we
were
not
dealing,
i
think
with
this
explicit

of
the

not
giving

but
saying
--
setting

justice

those
are
two
very

ohio
including
absentee
voters
and
sick
voters
and
military
votes,
overseas
and
so
on.
how
soon
the
state
will
need
to
know
the
decision
of
this
court
whatever
it
may
be
in
order
to
carryout
the
(voice

ohio
election.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
a
week
from
today?
justice
potter
stewart
a
week
from
tomorrow,
i
guess.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
lopeman,
i
have
so
much
more
practical
and
mechanical
sort
of
a
question.
the
interim
relief
that
i
granted
last
month
as
i
remember
required
the
state
of
ohio
for
the
time
being
to
put
on
the
ballot
the
names
of
the
american
independent
party
and
george
wallace
and
a
man
by
the
name
of
griffin.
well
now,
i
read
the
papers
every
now
and
griffin
wouldn't
seem
to
be
the
right
name
now,
would
it?
would
this
require
reprinting
whatever
the
court's
decision
is
in
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it's
a
--
some
importance
i
suppose
that
we
tried
to
know
what
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
name
on
there
if
for
vice
presidential
candidate
is
griffin,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
right.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that
was
decided
in
ray
against
blair,
wasn't
it?
that
question
if
i
understand
the
question
you're
raising.
that
was
the
case
and
which
alabama
did
require
by
state
law
that
the
electors
vote
for
the
national
candidates
of
their
party
and
this
court
in
ray
against
blair
and
opinion
by
mr.
justice
reed
and
all
of
that
did
not
violate
either
article
ii,
section
1
or
(voice
overlap).
justice
potter
stewart
but
is
there
a
provision
of
ohio
law
which
purports
to
require
electors
pledge
to
a
certain
presidential
candidate
to
vote
for
him?
justice
potter
stewart
how
about
a
national
convention
that's
another
requirement
and
these
i
suppose
there's
no
way
on
earth
that
even
all
the
people
in
ohio
could
require
party
to
have
a
national
convention,
that
would
take
cooperation
from
people
in
other
states,
wouldn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
but
you're
not
--
for
a
moment
suggesting
that
that's
a
reversal,
are
you?
justice
potter
stewart
you
mean
it's
your
understanding
it
certainly
my
understanding
that
the
state
could
with
equal
convenience
and
he
is
complied
with
an
order
which
would
in
fact
affirm
the
action
of
the
district
court?
justice
potter
stewart
was
that
as
a
party
or
just
a
candidate?
justice
potter
stewart
independent
candidate?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
pre-1948?
justice
potter
stewart
as
a
candidate?
justice
potter
stewart
the
laws
and
actually
after
1948
simply
limited
independent
candidates,
they
didn't
really
affect
the
laws
applicable
to
parties,
do
they?
justice
potter
stewart
if
that
was
i
know
that
you
could
no
longer
be
an
independent,
the
only
way
you
could
be
a
candidate
on
a
ballot
would
be
through
the
party
machinery?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
gordon,
we
are
all
throwing
around
the
word
“rights”
around
here
--
rights,
rights.
i
understand
ohio's
argument
in
the
previous
case
as
to
the
source
of
the
right
it
asserts
correctly
or
incorrectly,
it
cites
article
ii,
section
1
of
the
united
states
constitution.
now,
what
are
you
doing?
what
source
are
you
talking
about
for
these
“rights”?
justice
potter
stewart
because
i
presume
you're
talking
about
some
asserted
constitutional
right
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
federal
constitutional
right,
from
where?
justice
potter
stewart
at
clear
where
you
get
these
guidelines
from
the
district
court's
--
justice
potter
stewart
no,
you
know
wesberry
against
sanders,
reynolds
against
sims
have
nothing
to
do
with
parties
on
the
ballot?
justice
potter
stewart
and
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
electoral
college?
justice
potter
stewart
we
talk
about
time
for
printing.
there's
also
a
matter
of
getting
ballots
over
to
southeast
asia
and
back
and
then
to
the
hospitals
around
the
country
for
sick
absentee
voters
and
various
other
considerations
in
addition
to
printing.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
lopeman,
i
want
into
this
pretty
carefully
some
time
ago
and
i
would
agree
with
you
at
the
extent
that
it's
rather
ambiguous
as
to
what
they
asked.
they
recite
in
the
body
of
their
complaint
their
desire
against
such
relief,
i
would
agree
with
you
of
their
prayer
is
not
very
clear.
i
don't
have
it
in
front
of
me
but
as
i
finally
understood
it,
it
was
rather
a
conditional
prayer.
they
asked
first
that
the
legislature
be
directed
or
be
given
an
opportunity
to
do
something
about
this
and
then
they
said,
if
the
legislature
fails
to
act
then
we
ask
the
court
to
give
us
that
really,
was
that
about
right?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
not
a
condition?
justice
potter
stewart
you
haven't
taken
a
cross
appeal
from
that?
justice
potter
stewart
you
haven't
appeal
that
although
and
suppose
in
strict
logic
your
position
is
you
could've,
you
have?
justice
potter
stewart
but
so
you're
asking
us
to
affirm
that
--
the
district
court's
order
refusing
to
give
party
designation
not
for
the
reasons
that
the
district
court
said
necessarily
but
also
alternatively
for
an
addition
for
the
reason
that
the
district
court
was
wrong
about
the
unconstitutionality
of
the
ohio
statute.
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
this
court
didn't
give
them
the
right
to
women?
justice
potter
stewart
part
of
this
court
gave
negroes
the
right
to
vote,
that's
in
the
fifteenth
amendment?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
gordon,
what
do
you
say
to
the
representation
--
professional
representation
by
the
representative
of
the
attorney
general
of
ohio
that
it's
now
a
simple
impossibility
to
give
you
the
relief
that
you
asked
for
1968
and
i'm
not
now
talking
about
your
laches
perhaps
it's
all
my
fault
but
we're
dealing
with
the
fact
not
a
theory
as
he
represents
it
us,
what
do
you
say
on
that?
justice
potter
stewart
did
they
which
is
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
at
the
very
least
then,
you
would
require
these
counties
that
have
--
that
vote
by
voting
machines
to
turn
by
--
to
turn
the
paper
ballots
to
satisfy,
you
really
if
you
ask,
is
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
for
a
total
disruption
of
the
electoral
process
and
all?
justice
potter
stewart
it
still
represented
to
us
professionally
as
a
fact
that
there
is
not
time,
that
it's
impossible
to
do.
