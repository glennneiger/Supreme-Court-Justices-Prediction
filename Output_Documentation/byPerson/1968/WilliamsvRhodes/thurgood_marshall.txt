justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
young,
you
said
that
the
legislature
would
welcome
an
opportunity
to
take
another
look
at
the
48
statute.
why
didn't
you
file
in
the
state
court
to
give
them
that
opportunity?
justice
thurgood
marshall
there
were
in
session
in
february.
there
were
in
session
in
february
i
assume.
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
have
declaratory
judgment
in
ohio
state
courts?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
was
a
wrong
assumption.
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
isn't
that
was
lawyers
are
for?
justice
thurgood
marshall
isn't
that
was
lawyers
are
for,
confused
the
statutes?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
lopeman,
what
interest
does
the
state
have
in
preventing
splintering
of
a
political
party?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
if
a
group
of
voters
want
to
leave
a
party
and
to
use
your
word
splinter,
they
don't
have
that
right
in
ohio.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
really
don't
want
third
party?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
just
restrict
it
to
tyrannical
minorities
or
not?
i'm
using
your
words
now.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
said,
“tyrannical.”
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
is
it
restricted
to
tyrannical
minorities
or
all
minorities?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
used
the
word
“tyrannical”
minorities
that
one
i
was
talking
about.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
number
two,
i
asked
you,
is
it
restricted
to
that
order?
are
you
trying
to
stop
tyranny
or
you're
trying
to
stop
minorities
from
voting?
justice
thurgood
marshall
let
me
get
you
straight,
a
minute
ago
you
said,
history
shows
that
no
minority
party
has
ever
won.
and
five
minutes
later,
you're
arguing
about
the
tyranny
of
minority
party.
are
you
talking
about
the
same
minorities?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
they
never
won
but
still
there's
tyranny?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
interesting.
justice
thurgood
marshall
israel?
justice
thurgood
marshall
there's
a
little
difference
in
government,
people,
area,
etcetera
of
israel
and
united
states.
let's
talk
about
the
united
states.
justice
thurgood
marshall
we
still
have
fourteenth
amendment
and
first.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
think
that
fourteenth
amendment
of
due
process
can
argue
--
can
answer
the
question
to
whether
you
can
restrict
the
right
to
vote
to
one
political
party.
wouldn't
you
agree?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
if
in
50
states
they
decided
that
only
democrats
can
vote
republican
be
rather
out
of
business,
would
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
wouldn't
they?
justice
thurgood
marshall
when
was
the
candidate
selected?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes,
sir.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
you
couldn't
have
complied
with
the
february
rule,
could
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
who
was
your
candidate
four
years
ago?
justice
thurgood
marshall
uh-huh.
justice
thurgood
marshall
while
you're
answering
that,
the
next
question
is
why
didn't
raise
the
question
then?
justice
thurgood
marshall
where
did
the
political
party
get
the
“right”
on
this
court
to
be
on
the
ballot?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
now
you
say
its
one
and
a
half
of
1%,
the
states
has
its
15%
you
got
a
half
to
bid
him
for
us?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i've
said,
you
say
that
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
state
has
15%.
now,
would
give
us
a
happy
medium?
justice
thurgood
marshall
because
you
wouldn't
qualify,
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that's
the
reason
you
want
this
one
figured
it
just
fits
you
like
a
glove?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
would
escape
the
right
and
limit
in
the
ballot
to
100
people,
don't
you
think
that
was
good?
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
that
be
good?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
think
the
state
to
have
a
ballot
that
would
have
a
thousand
people
running
for
president?
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
that
be
the
state
have
a
right
to
protect
itself
from
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
anytime
may
i
ask
the
state
court
to
correct
this.
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
since
(inaudible)
date
till
date,
you
have
never
asked
the
state,
you
say
the
state
is
wrong,
you
never
asked
the
state
to
correct
its
own
error.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
state.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
not
true
for
the
courts
i'm
sure.
justice
thurgood
marshall
(voice
overlap)
and
they
didn't
go
under
state
court?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
it
took
you
20
years
to
find
that
out?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
gordon,
if
you
had
filed
this
case
on
exact
same
time
in
1964
and
this
court
had
decided
exactly
what
the
chief
justice
suggests
here
you
wouldn't
be
here
today,
would
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
isn't
it
that
simple,
you
waited
around.
justice
thurgood

(inaudible)
