mr.
armand
derfner
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
in
these
three
consolidated
cases
from
the
southern
district
of
mississippi
is
how
much
room
congress
intended
to
leave
when
it
passed
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965
to
allow
the
southern
states
covered
by
the
voting
rights
act
to
continue
evading
the
guarantees
of
the
fifteenth
amendment.
the
answer,
we
believe,
is
found
in
the
provision
of
that
act
which
is
involved
in
this
case,
section
5
in
which
congress,
after
having,
in
section
4,
outlawed
any
tests
or
devices
when
it
was
aiming
primarily
at
that
time
literacy
tests,
went
further
and
provided
that
no
state
covered
by
the
act
might
enact
or
seek
to
administer
any
voting
qualification
or
prerequisite
to
voting
where
standard
practice
or
procedure
with
respect
to
voting
different
from
that
in
effect
in
1964
--
november
1964
without
seeking
prior
approval
from
either
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
or
getting
a
declaratory
judgment
from
the
district
of
columbia
--
from
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia
establishing
that
that
new
statute
or
regulation
did
not
have
a
discriminatory
purpose
or
effect.
the
three
cases
here,
number
25,
fairley
versus
patterson,
26,
bunton
versus
patterson,
and
36,
whitley
versus
williams,
all
involve
statutes
which
the
state
of
mississippi
passed
in
1966
at
its
first
legislative
session
after
the
passage
of
the
voting
rights
act
which,
we
claim,
have
the
purpose
and
effect
of
discriminating
and
voting
by
reason
of
race
and
which
are
covered
--
which
are
voting
laws
within
the
meaning
of
section
5
and
which
--
as
to
which,
there
is
no
dispute
that
these
statutes
were
not
submitted
to
the
attorney
general
or
for
declaratory
judgment.
in
number
25,
fairley
versus
patterson,
the
legislature
allowed
a
shift
in
the
manner
of
electing
--
allowed
a
county
to
adopt
to
shift
its
manner
of
electing
the
board
of
supervisors
with
the
chief
executive
officers
of
the
county
from
beat
or
district
elections
to
at
large
elections.
thus,
allowing
a
county
that
might
have
one
or
more
negro
majority
beats
to
elect
all
white
supervisors
if
it
were
a
white-majority
county
as
a
whole.
in
number
26,
bunton,
the
legislature
changed
the
office
of
county
superintendent
of
education
which
have
previously
been
elective
to
appointive
post,
and
did
so
with
respect
to
11
counties
of
which
9
had
negro
majorities.
mr.
lichtman
will
argue
number
25
and
number
26.
in
number
36,
whitley
versus
williams,
the
legislature
adopted
an
amendment
to
section
3260
which
provides
the
manner
by
which
independent
candidates
may
gain
--
may
get
on
the
ballot
and,
in
effect,
set
up
an
obstacle
course
that
was
designed
and
had
the
effect
of
forcing
independent
candidates,
except
at
great
trouble
and
effort,
to
go
into
the
democratic
primary
or
a
party
primary
and
to
avoid
seeking
to
run
as
independents.
the
background
of
19
--
mr.
armand
derfner
i'm
sorry,
justice
fortas.
number
36,
whitley
versus
williams,
arose
in
1966.
the
statute
involved
an
amendment
to
section
3260,
was
passed
in
june
of
1966
after
reverent
whitley
and
one
other
person
had
run
in
the
democratic
primary,
reverent
whitley
having
run
for
the
office
of
the
united
states
senator,
having
lost
in
the
primary,
and
then
indicating
that
he
was
interested
in
running
in
the
general
election.
at
that
point,
the
amendment
was
passed
and
it
had
this
effect.
it
multiplied
the
number
of
signatures
that
a
person
must
gain
--
must
get
in
order
to
gain
a
place
in
the
ballot
as
an
independent.
in
the
case
of
reverent
whitley,
the
number
of
signatures
was
multiplied
by
--
it
was
changed
from
1,000
to
10,000
since
it
was
a
statewide
office.
it
required
these
signatures
--
mr.
armand
derfner
in
mississippi,
at
that
time,
there
were
probably
in
the
neighborhood
of
400,000
or
500,000
registered
voters.
the
second
thing
it
did
was
to
require
that
these
signatures
be
submitted
at
a
much
earlier
date
than
formerly.
the
former
practice
--
former
statute,
3260,
had
provided
that
the
required
signatures
be
submitted
40
days
before
the
general
election,
in
practical
effect,
the
end
of
september.
the
new
regulation
--
the
new
statute
required
that
the
signatures
be
submitted
at
the
same
time
as
one
would
qualify
for
running
in
the
party
primary.
now,
the
statutes
governing
running
in
party
primaries
require
that
60
days
before
the
primary
a
candidate
submit
his
intent
--
notice
of
his
intention
to
run
and
a
filing
fee
of
a
small
amount
to
the
executive
committee
--
executive
secretary
of
his
party
which
means
that,
under
the
new
statute,
whereas
someone
wanting
to
run
in
a
party
primary
had
to
submit
by
some
date
in
april,
say,
$100
or
$200
plus
a
notice
of
intention
to
run.
reverent
whitley
or
whoever
was
govern
--
whoever
wished
to
run
as
an
independent
had
to
submit
petitions
with
10,000
or
some-lesser
number
of
signatures,
depending
on
what
office
was
involved.
the
third
and,
in
some
ways,
the
most
significant
effect
was
to
impose
a
new
requirement
that
one
who
had
voted
in
a
party
primary
could
not,
thereafter,
run
as
an
independent.
finally,
the
new
stat
--
mr.
armand
derfner
no,
i
think
the
statute
means
that
one
who
has
voted
in
the
primary
that
year
for
--
mr.
armand
derfner
the
primary
--
mr.
armand
derfner
the
primary
for
which
--
for
the
same
office
for
which
he
is
running.
mr.
armand
derfner
that's
right.
mr.
armand
derfner
i'm
not
familiar
with
that,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
i
do
know
that
that
was
not
the
provision
in
mississippi
before
and
there
had
been
a
number
of
instances
of
people
being
unsuccessful
in
primaries
and
running
in
general
elections.
there's
a
case
called
bowen
versus
williams
which
was
cited
in
the
brief,
in
which
precisely
that
happened.
and,
the
supreme
court
of
mississippi
held
that
there
was
no
impediment
to
that
being
done.
mr.
armand
derfner
that's
right.
there
is
a
section
3129
in
the
mississippi
code
which
imposes
a
pledge
of
loyalty
to
anyon
--
on
anyone
voting
in
a
party
primary,
but
that's
been
held
not
to
be
enforceable
in
connection
with
his
running
as
an
independent
candidate.
that
was
the
case
that
i
was
referring
to.
mr.
armand
derfner
if
you
have
voted
--
mr.
armand
derfner
that's
right.
mr.
armand
derfner
there
is
no
prohibition
in
the
statute
against
running
as
an
independent
if
you
have
merely
run
but
not
voted
in
the
primary.
nonetheless,
one
of
the
record
shows
that
at
least
one
of
the
people
who
was
kept
off
the
ballot
in
1967
was
kept
off
because
he
had
run
in
the
primary,
though
not
voted.
we
d
--
that
does
not
appear
to
be,
however,
what
the
statute
says.
mr.
armand
derfner
no,
we
believe,
your
honor,
and
in
fact
we
--
i
don't
think
we'd
be
here
if
we
did
not
believe
that
this
was
a
statute
that
violates
the
fifteenth
amendment
of
the
united
states.
we
believe
that
--
mr.
armand
derfner
no,
your
honor.
all
that
is
before
you
is
whether
this
is
a
law
with
--
a
law
that
imposes
a
voting
prerequisite
or
qualification
or
standard
practice
of
procedure
with
respect
to
voting.
if
you
decide
that
it
is,
then
the
statute
cannot,
could
not
have
been,
and
cannot
be
put
into
effect
until
the
federal
clearance
either
through
the
attorney
general
--
mr.
armand
derfner
that
is
the
sole
issue.
mr.
armand
derfner
the
fifteenth
amendment
was
in
our
pleading.
mr.
armand
derfner
we
took
it
out,
justice
marshall,
because
we
--
in
1967
when
this
case
came
up
for
the
second
time,
the
case
came
up
in
september,
we
did
not
believe
we
had
enough
time
at
that
point
to
put
on
a
case
with
respect
to
the
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
amendments.
and
so,
at
that
time,
though
the
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
amendment
claims
remained
in
the
case,
and
they
do
remain
in
the
case,
now,
we
entered
a
stipulation
with
the
appellees,
with
the
attorney
general,
that
the
only
issue
before
the
district
court
at
that
time
was
the
issue
of
section
5.
this
means,
by
the
way,
that
we
would
maintain
that
the
constitutional
issues
are
still
in
the
case
that
section
2281
did
and
does
apply
and
that,
wholly
apart
from
any
question
of
section
5,
we
were
and
are
entitled
to
a
three-judge
court
and,
therefore,
that
this
court
would
have
jurisdiction
by
direct
appeal.
we
did
not
mean,
in
any
way,
to
take
the
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
amendment
issues
out
of
the
case,
and
we
believe,
in
fact,
that
we
could
prove
that
if
we
were
put
to
it.
mr.
armand
derfner
pardon
me,
your
honor?
mr.
armand
derfner
the
stipulation,
which
is
in
the
record
at
--
it's
an
appendix
to
the
opinion
of
the
three-judge
court
appearing
on
page
39
of
the
record
here,
paragraph
5,
that
the
only
issue
before
the
court
at
this
time
is
whether
or
not
house
bill
68,
amended
section
3260,
is
an
attempt
by
the
state
of
mississippi
to
enact
or
seek
to
enact
to
administer
any
voting
law
within
the
meaning
of
section
5.
there's
nothing
in
the
stipulation
and
nothing
else
anywhere
in
the
case
that
indicates
that
the
constitutional
issues
are
no
longer
in
the
case.
the
final
requirement
of
the
new
section
3260
was
that
every
vote
--
every
signature
on
the
petition
had
to
be
in
the
petitioner's
own
hand
--
own
handwriting.
and,
while
it's
not
clear
--
while
this
specific
provision
has
not
been
at
issue
or
been
the
specific
issue
involved
in
any
of
the
cases
in
the
record
and
it's
not
clear
just
how
far
this
goes,
we
think
it
is
open
to
the
interpretation,
and
a
fatal
interpretation,
that
this
require
--
that
this
would
prohibit
illiterates
from
signing
petitions
on
behalf
of
independent
candidates.
after
the
statute
was
passed,
reverent
whitley
and
two
others
who
were
kept
off
the
ballot
submitted
petitions
to
run
as
independent
candidates
in
the
fall
of
1966.
they
were
ruled
off
the
ballot
not
because
they
had
not
complied
in
time
or
because
they
had
voted
in
the
primary
as
to
both
of
which
this
would've
been
an
expos
facto
law,
but
because
they
had
not
submitted
sufficient
signatures.
at
that
point,
in
the
fall
of
1966,
we
filed
this
suit
on
--
as
a
class
action
on
behalf
of
reverent
whitley
and
the
two
others
in
their
capacity,
both
as
voters
and
as
candidates,
and
the
three-judge
court
at
that
time,
without
going
into
any
of
the
statutory
or
constitutional
issues,
as
an
exercise
of
its
equity,
jurisdiction,
and
discretion
ruled
that
these
three
candidates
should
be
placed
on
the
ballot.
in
1967,
the
situation
arose
again,
and
at
that
point,
as
the
record
shows,
there
were
at
least
16
candidates
ranging
from
people
who
were
running
for
justice
of
the
peace
in
various
counties,
all
the
way
to
mrs.
fannie
lou
hamer
who
sought
to
run
for
state
senate
from
sunflower
county
who
had
been
ruled
off
the
ballot.
i
should
mention
that
the
1967
elections
were
the
statewide
elections
in
which
virtually
all
state
offices
were
being
chosen.
this
was
the
first
time
in
modern
history
that
any
substantial
number
of
negro
candidates
had
run
or
sought
to
run.
it
was
also
the
first
time
in
modern
history
that
any
--
that,
with
the
exception
of
a
single
negro
community
in
mississippi,
that
any
negro
candidates
have
been
elected.
these
16
people
or
more
were
kept
off
the
ballot
for
various
reasons,
although
they
had
complied
or
would've
complied
with
the
old
provisions
of
section
3260.
at
that
time,
we
brought
the
suit
on
again
and,
this
time,
the
three-judge
court
ruled
against
us.
and,
it
was
from
that
decision
which
held
essentially
that
section
3260
dealt
only
with
elections
or
with
candidates
but
not
with
voting,
that
this
appeal
was
taken.
the
point
of
this
appeal,
we
submit,
is
very
much
like
the
point
in
williams
versus
roads
decided
by
this
court
yesterday
in
which
the
court
said
dealt
--
dealing
with
the
right
of
the
american
independent
party
to
be
on
the
ballot,
spoke
of
the
ohio
provision
as
a
burden
on
the
right
of
qualified
voters
regardless
of
their
political
persuasion
to
cast
their
votes
effectively.
i
think
it's
significant
that
section
3260
is
the
first
--
one
of
the
first
major
attempts
by
the
state
of
mississippi
to
deal
in
any
significant
way
with
the
problem
of
general
elections.
mississippi,
is
perhaps
the
most
or
certainly
one
of
the
most
confirmed
of
the
one-party
states
of
this
nation,
has
always
paid
a
great
deal
of
attention
to
regulation
of
primary
elections
than
to
regulation
of
general
elections.
the
two
outstanding
examples
of
that
are
the
corrupt
practices
act
which,
in
mississippi,
applies
only
to
primary
elections
and
not
to
general
elections
and
the
requirement
of
the
runoff
which,
again,
applies
only
to
primary
elections
and
not
to
general
elections.
the
tradition
in
mississippi
has
always
been
that
whoever
wins
the
primary
is
essentially
the
winner
of
the
general
election.
in
most
cases
or
many
cases
in
recent
history,
there
has
not
been
any
opposition
at
the
general
elections.
at
the
same
time,
with
the
passage
of
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965,
a
new
factor
came
into
mississippi
politics
and
this
was
the
negro
voter.prior
to
1965,
various
figures
in
the
reports
of
the
united
states
civil
rights
commission,
other
figures
indicated
that
something
like
7%
of
the
eligible
negro
voters
in
mississippi
were
registered
to
vote.
after
the
--
mr.
armand
derfner
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
armand
derfner
yes,
justice
harlan.
mr.
armand
derfner
no,
because
we
--
mr.
armand
derfner
we
believe
that
section
5
was
intended
to
cover
to
be
every
bit
as
broad
as
the
fifteenth
amendment
itself,
that
when
congress
passed
the
voting
rights
of
--
act
of
1965
they
knew
full
well
that
this
was
--
that
they
had
been
relatively
unsuccessful
in
guaranteeing
the
provisions
of
the
fifteenth
amendment
before
that.
they
had
tried
in
1957,
in
1960,
and
in
1964.
we
believe
that
what
congress
sought
to
do
in
1965
was
to
ensure
that
they
would
not
have
to
pass
a
voting
rights
act
of
1966
because
they
knew
that
on
each
occasion,
when
they
had
passed
legislation
before
that,
the
states
that
they
were
aiming
at
had
then
come
up
with
another
new
provision
that
had
not
been
covered
by
the
act.
and
so,
we
think
that
section
5
was
passed
very
broadly
in
order
to
cover
everything
possible
that
could
be
covered
the
fifteenth
amendment.
mr.
armand
derfner
section
--
well,
section
5
would
--
the
final
determination
of
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia
would
cover
only
things
that
were
--
no,
let
me
put
it
this
way.
with
the
exception
of
the
placing
of
the
burden
of
proof,
i
believe
that
section
5
would
be
the
same
as
the
--
would
cover
only
or
would
prohibit
after
clearance
only
things
that
were
in
violation
of
the
fifteenth
amendment.
in
other
words
--
mr.
armand
derfner
right,
a
good
faith
--
mr.
armand
derfner
a
good
faith
--
mr.
armand
derfner
no.
well,
it
would
come
under
section
5
in
the
sense
that
it
would
have
to
be
cleared
--
mr.
armand
derfner
under
provisions
of
section
5.
i
took
justice
harlan's
question
to
indicate
what
would
be
clear
to
what
would
not
be
clear
under
section
5,
and
a
good
faith
literacy
test
would
be
cleared
since
it
would
not
--
mr.
armand
derfner
i
think
the
kind
of
question
that
has
to
go
to
the
district
of
columbia
court
is
any
question
relating
to
voting,
whether
it
discriminates
or
not.
mr.
armand
derfner
that's
right.
mr.
armand
derfner
yes,
justice
white.
we
think
that
reapportionment
is
one
of
the
most
significant
examples
of
this.
any
situation
in
which
the
state
does
anything
which
has
the
potential
of
depriving
somebody
of
the
right
to
vote
on
base
of
race
or
abridging
--
mr.
armand
derfner
not
all
reapportionment
cases,
justice
white.
i
think
mr.
lichtman
will
be
dealing
in
somewhat
more
detail
with
the
reapportionment
question.
mr.
armand
derfner
only
reapportionment
cases
from
the
covered
states
--
mr.
armand
derfner
would
be
going
through.
mr.
armand
derfner
all
those
rea
--
mr.
armand
derfner
that's
true.
every
reapportionment
case
would
have
to
be
passed
on
not
--
but
not
necessarily
by
the
district
of
columbia
court.
in
most
cases,
it
could
be
done,
and
i
believe
it
has
been
done
--
mr.
armand
derfner
by
the
attorney
general.
and,
i
think
the
attorney
general's
information
indicates
that
there
had
been
a
great
number
of
submissions
of
reapportionment
plans
and
that
all
of
these
have
been
approved.
so
that,
in
most
--
and
we
think
it's
quite
proper
that
where
you
have
a
reapportionment
plan,
you
have
the
best
--
you
have,
in
a
sense,
the
most
convenient
opportunity
for
a
state
to
discriminate
with
re
--
in
voting
with
respect
by
--
on
the
basis
of
race
in
a
way
that
seems
innocent.
and,
we
believe
that
where
that
is
in
fact
innocent,
that
there
will
be
no
trouble,
and
where
it
is
not
in
fact
innocent,
that
is
perfectly
proper
to
have
the
state
be
required
to
pass
muster
by
submitting
it
to
the
attorney
general
and,
if
he
disapproves,
to
decla
--
to
seeking
declaratory
judgment
in
the
district
of
columbia.
mr.
armand
derfner
my
own
case,
number
36,
will
be
covered
by
standard
practice
or
procedure
with
respect
to
voting.
we
think
that
--
mr.
armand
derfner
yes,
we
think
that,
as
in
williams
versus
roads,
the
question
of
who
gets
on
the
ballot
is
so
closely
related
to
the
question
of
who
the
voter
can
vote
for
and
how
he
can
make
his
vote
effective,
that
it
is
a
question
of
standard
practice
or
procedure
with
respect
to
voting.
mr.
armand
derfner
pardon
me,
justice
harlan?
mr.
armand
derfner
i
believe
it
does,
justice
harlan.
that
if,
for
example
--
mr.
armand
derfner
i
think
it
would
cover
that,
justice
harlan.
that,
again,
is
a
sort
of
question
that
should
be
submitted
to
the
attorney
general.
i
think,
quite
possibly
in
that
situation,
if
they
were
not
a
racial
cast
to
it,
that
that's
the
sort
of
thing
that
the
attorney
general
would
approve.
mr.
armand
derfner
no,
i
think
a
statute
like
that
should
be
submitted,
that
it
is
covered
by
section
5.
you
can
think
of
the
example,
suppose
--
take
the
grandfather
clause
case
for
this
court
when
--
and
its
progeny.
suppose
the
statute
said
not
simply
that
one
who
is
the
--
was
eligible
to
vote
in
1867
was
the
ancestor
of
one
who
was
eligible
to
vote
may
vote
without
registering,
one
who
is
not
may
not.
suppose
the
statute
said
one
who
was
eligible
to
vote
in
1867
may
run
for
office
as
an
independent
or
may
run
for
office,
if
he
was
not
so
eligible
to
vote
or
his
ancestor
was
not
then
he
may
not
run
for
office.
we
think
that's
precisely
the
sort
of
thing
that
is
covered
by
section
5.
i
might
say
in
this
connection
that
the
appellees
have
talked
about
the
language
of
section
5
as
being
somewhat
narrower.
they've
talked
about
the
use
of
the
word
"comply"
in
the
second
sentence
of
section
5,
and
they've
said
"unless
and
until
the
clearance
is
obtained,
no
person
shall
be
denied
the
right
to
vote
for
failure
to
comply."
we
think,
there,
that
the
words
"comply"
were
not
intended
to
be
and
should
not
be
read
as
limiting
the
terms
"voting
standard,
practice,
procedure,
prerequisite,
or
qualification."
the
word
comply,taken
in
its
most
logical
sense
there,
would
apply
to
the
qualification
or
prerequisite.
it
would
not
be
an
act
limiting
phrase
with
respect
to
the
phrases
"standard
practice
or
procedure"
which
were
inserted
in
the
act
after
its
introduction.
for
example,
we
can
think
of
examples
that
i
think
would,
even
more
clearly
than
these
cases,
be
covered
by
this
--
by
section
5
as
to
which
the
word
"comply"
would
not
be
an
appropriate
word,
and
these
have
to
do,
for
example,
with
various
actions
of
the
election
officials.
for
example,
chan
--
a
law
changing
the
counting
of
the
ballots
from
a
public
counting
to
a
secret
counting,
or
a
law
changing
the
polling
places
from
public
buildings
or
public
places
to
private
places,
thus,
allowing
polling
places
to
be
held
in
--
on
plantations
or
stores
or
what
have
you
or,
for
example,
a
law
that
abolish
the
use
of
poll
watchers.
all
these,
i
believe,
it
would
clearly
come
within
section
5
and
these
do
not
fit
as
clearly
within
the
use
of
the
word
"comply."
i
think
those
are
good
examples
showing
why
the
word
"comply"
should
not
be
read
as
limiting
the
statute.
i
think
the
coverage
of
section
5
is
the
fact
that
all
these
statutes
may
have
to
be
submitted
for
approval
is
not
one
that
should
be
regarded
as
a
reason
to
narrow
the
scope
of
section
5.
certainly,
it's
strong
medicine
but
congress
knew
when
it
passed
section
5
that
it
was
dealing
with
a
virulent
disease
and
the
very
fact
that
great
numbers
of
submissions
have
come
to
the
attorney
general
from
--
in
almost
every
case
from
states
other
than
mississippi,
i
think,
indicates
that
congress
meant
for
the
easy
statutes,
the
obvious
statutes,
the
statues
that
were
constitutional
to
sail
through,
and
they
have
sailed
through,
but
congress
meant
to
put
a
block
on
the
states
from
monkeying
around
with
the
fifteenth
amendment
from
doing
the
things
that
they
have
been
doing
that
previous
statutes
had
failed
to
curve,
and
--
mr.
armand
derfner
i
think
the
attorney
general's
records
indicate,
according
to
my
information,
that
only
one
matter
has
ever
been
submitted
from
the
state
of
mississippi
and
that
was
not
done
by
the
state
of
mississippi
but
by
the
board
of
supervisors
of
a
single
county.
mr.
armand
derfner
may
it
please
the
court.
the
position
of
all
the
appellants
on
the
question
of
relief
is
as
follows.
we
believe
that
section
5
imposed
an
additional
requirement
for
putting
into
effect
a
state
statute
within
its
coverage
that,
in
the
absence
of
fulfilling
that
requirement,
the
statute
was
not
in
effect
and
it
was
as
if
no
statute
had
been
passed.
therefore,
we
believe
that,
since
the
statutes
in
these
cases
have
been
void
and
are
now
void,
that
we
are
entitled
to
new
elections
that
are
retrospective
relief
as
well
as
prospective
relief
the
day
this
court
reverses
the
judgments
below.
at
that
point,
the
proper
relief
would
be
for
the
court
to
remand
to
the
court
below
for
new
elections.
we
don't
think
it's
the
job
of
this
court
or
the
court
below
to
tell
the
state
what
to
do
about
whom
to
submit
the
statute
to,
about
whether
to
submit
the
statute
at
all,
or
about
what
to
do
if
it
wishes
to
put
the
statute
into
effect.
if
the
state
wishes
to
submit
the
statute
to
somebody
and
come
back
to
the
court
below
before
such
time
as
is
fixed
promptly
for
holding
a
new
election,
then
that
court
might,
within
the
exercise
of
its
equitable
discretion,
decide
to,
if
there
were
a
favorable
determination,
favorable
to
the
state,
might
decide
not
to
hold
the
new
election.
but,
we
think
that
the
state
--
the
court
below
should
proceed
expeditiously
to
hold
new
elections,
that
those
new
elections
should
be
held
and
--
mr.
armand
derfner
yes.
mr.
armand
derfner
yes,
but
at
the
time
these
cases
were
brought,
in
each
case,
the
proper
thing
for
the
court
below
to
have
done
and
the
convenient
thing
in
all
cases
would've
been
to
grasp
the
--
mr.
armand
derfner
that's
right.
mr.
armand
derfner
yes,
i
do,
but
i
think
that,
as
hamer
against
campbell,
a
fifth
circuit
case,
says,
one
of
the
considerations
in
exercising
the
equity
jurisdiction
of
a
court
is
how
difficult
it
would
have
been
at
that
time,
how
disruptive
it
is
now.
and,
we
think
it
is
quite
within
the
equity
jurisdiction
of
this
court
and
the
court
below,
and
would
be
the
proper
remedy
to
order
to
go
back
to
the
situation
as
it
stood
at
that
time.
otherwise,
we
think
the
rights
are
--
mr.
armand
derfner
yes,
we
do.
mr.
armand
derfner
that's
right.
mr.
armand
derfner
i
think,
mr.
chief
justice,
we
have
to
look
at
what
the
statute
was
meant
to
do.
the
submission
to
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia
or
to
the
attorney
general
was
not
regarded
as
a
formalistic
matter.
it
was
regarded
as
something
of
--
mr.
armand
derfner
not
regarded
as
a
formalistic
matter.
it
was
regarded
to
something
--
mr.
armand
derfner
no,
it
was
regarded
to
something
of
great
substance.
it
was
regarded
as
a
way
of
making
certain
that
this
statute
has
--
had,
as
close
as
possible
to
automatic
effect,
as
we
said
in
south
carolina
versus
katzenbach.
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
congress,
in
seeking
to
pass,
an
--
as
automatic
as
possible,
a
trigger
statute,
would've
meant
to
allow
these
rights
to
be
delayed
for
so
long.
i
might
say
--
what
i
was
trying
to
say
before
in
connection
with
the
lower
court's
equity
jurisdiction
is
that
the
--
if
the
court
orders
new
elections,
i
should
think
that
if
the
state
in
the
interim
were
to
go
to
the
attorney
general
and
get
a
favorable
determination
before
those
new
elections
took
place,
it
would
be
well
within
the
equitable
jurisdiction
of
the
court
below
to
set
aside
the
order
for
new
elections.
all
i'm
saying
is
that
the
court's
procedure
should
go
on
and
not
--
and
whatever
can
be
done
by
the
state
within
such
seasonable
time
as
exists
before
the
election
which,
almost
certainly,
would
include
time
to
get
a
favorable
response
if
one
were
forthcoming
from
the
attorney
general,
could
be
effective.
but,
i
don't
think
that
the
court
should
wait
until
the
state
has
a
chance
to
seek
a
declaratory
judgment
in
the
district
of
columbia
then
appeal
that
to
this
court.
by
that
time,
what
we've
had
is
close
to
the
five
years
of
the
operation
of
the
statute,
eaten
up
by
the
state's
recalcitrance,
and
i
don't
think
that's
what
congress
intended.
mr.
armand
derfner
no,
your
honor,
i
believe
this
court's
proper
order
should
call
--
should
direct
the
court
below
to
call
for
new
elections.
what
the
state
wishes
to
do
in
the
way
of
submission
or
to
whom
it
wishes
to
submit
is
up
to
the
state.
if
the
state
wishes
to
submit,
it
may
do
so.
if
it
gets
an
answer
back
in
time
before
the
election
and
it
certainly
would
have
time
to,
that's
fine.
if
the
state
does
not
wish
to
submit
and
it
might
decide,
for
example
in
the
bunton
case,
that
it
doesn't
wish
to
submit,
then
it's
not
up
to
this
court
or
the
court
below
to
tell
--
to
suggest
to
the
state
what
it
should
do
to
put
--
to
comply
with
its
obligations
under
section
5.
mr.
armand
derfner
no,
because
i
think,
in
that
event,
if
the
court
below
decided
that,
in
its
equitable
discretion,
that
the
approval,
even
at
this
late
date,
indicated
that
the
state's
error
was,
in
effect,
harmless,
i
think
that
would
be
quite
consistent
with
this
court's
mandate
because
it
would
say
that
this
great
duty
of
the
state,
this
not
merely
formalistic
duty,
though
it
had
not
been
done
before,
had
been
done
now
in
a
way
that
showed
that
the
statute
was
proper
and
could
be
put
into
effect.
what
we're
talking
about
--
in
a
sense,
some
of
these
things
don't
fit
tightly
into
logical
boxes,
but
we
think
they
were
talking
about
the
most
practical
way
of
solving
the
statute
and
petition
the
rights
--
mr.
armand
derfner
the
problem
was
--
mr.
armand
derfner
no,
justice
fortas.
mr.
armand
derfner
not
quite,
because
we're
willing
to
do
that
in
connection
with
the
attorney
general,
submission
to
the
attorney
general,
because,
as
a
practical
matter,
there'd
be
a
chance
--
there'd
be
time
to
get
a
response
from
the
attorney
general
before
any
new
election
were
held,
and
we're
willing
to
do
that
because
we
don't
believe
that
would
hold
anything
up.
we're
not
willing,
though,
to
agree
that
that
relief
should
be
held
up
until
a
submission
to
the
--
mr.
armand
derfner
we
think
the
baseline,
justice
fortas,
is
that
the
state
is
not
entitled
to
put
the
statute
in
effect,
that
the
statech
ha
--
state
had
no
statute
until
such
time
as
it
complied.
we
think
that
a
court
has
equitable
discretion
to
essentially
give
the
state
more
than
it's
entitled
to,
but
not
where
that
might
result
in
frustrating
appellant's
rights
for
an
additional
year
or
two.
mr.
armand
derfner
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
in
these
three
consolidated
cases
from
the
southern
district
of
mississippi
is
how
much
room
congress
intended
to
leave
when
it
passed
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965
to
allow
the
southern
states
covered
by
the
voting
rights
act
to
continue
evading
the
guarantees
of
the
fifteenth
amendment.
the
answer,
we
believe,
is
found
in
the
provision
of
that
act
which
is
involved
in
this
case,
section
5
in
which
congress,
after
having,
in
section
4,
outlawed
any
tests
or
devices
when
it
was
aiming
primarily
at
that
time
literacy
tests,
went
further
and
provided
that
no
state
covered
by
the
act
might
enact
or
seek
to
administer
any
voting
qualification
or
prerequisite
to
voting
where
standard
practice
or
procedure
with
respect
to
voting
different
from
that
in
effect
in
1964
--
november
1964
without
seeking
prior
approval
from
either
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
or
getting
a
declaratory
judgment
from
the
district
of
columbia
--
from
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia
establishing
that
that
new
statute
or
regulation
did
not
have
a
discriminatory
purpose
or
effect.
the
three
cases
here,
number
25,
fairley
versus
patterson,
26,
bunton
versus
patterson,
and
36,
whitley
versus
williams,
all
involve
statutes
which
the
state
of
mississippi
passed
in
1966
at
its
first
legislative
session
after
the
passage
of
the
voting
rights
act
which,
we
claim,
have
the
purpose
and
effect
of
discriminating
and
voting
by
reason
of
race
and
which
are
covered
--
which
are
voting
laws
within
the
meaning
of
section
5
and
which
--
as
to
which,
there
is
no
dispute
that
these
statutes
were
not
submitted
to
the
attorney
general
or
for
declaratory
judgment.
in
number
25,
fairley
versus
patterson,
the
legislature
allowed
a
shift
in
the
manner
of
electing
--
allowed
a
county
to
adopt
to
shift
its
manner
of
electing
the
board
of
supervisors
with
the
chief
executive
officers
of
the
county
from
beat
or
district
elections
to
at
large
elections.
thus,
allowing
a
county
that
might
have
one
or
more
negro
majority
beats
to
elect
all
white
supervisors
if
it
were
a
white-majority
county
as
a
whole.
in
number
26,
bunton,
the
legislature
changed
the
office
of
county
superintendent
of
education
which
have
previously
been
elective
to
appointive
post,
and
did
so
with
respect
to
11
counties
of
which
9
had
negro
majorities.
mr.
lichtman
will
argue
number
25
and
number
26.
in
number
36,
whitley
versus
williams,
the
legislature
adopted
an
amendment
to
section
3260
which
provides
the
manner
by
which
independent
candidates
may
gain
--
may
get
on
the
ballot
and,
in
effect,
set
up
an
obstacle
course
that
was
designed
and
had
the
effect
of
forcing
independent
candidates,
except
at
great
trouble
and
effort,
to
go
into
the
democratic
primary
or
a
party
primary
and
to
avoid
seeking
to
run
as
independents.
the
background
of
19
--
mr.
armand
derfner
i'm
sorry,
justice
fortas.
number
36,
whitley
versus
williams,
arose
in
1966.
the
statute
involved
an
amendment
to
section
3260,
was
passed
in
june
of
1966
after
reverent
whitley
and
one
other
person
had
run
in
the
democratic
primary,
reverent
whitley
having
run
for
the
office
of
the
united
states
senator,
having
lost
in
the
primary,
and
then
indicating
that
he
was
interested
in
running
in
the
general
election.
at
that
point,
the
amendment
was
passed
and
it
had
this
effect.
it
multiplied
the
number
of
signatures
that
a
person
must
gain
--
must
get
in
order
to
gain
a
place
in
the
ballot
as
an
independent.
in
the
case
of
reverent
whitley,
the
number
of
signatures
was
multiplied
by
--
it
was
changed
from
1,000
to
10,000
since
it
was
a
statewide
office.
it
required
these
signatures
--
mr.
armand
derfner
in
mississippi,
at
that
time,
there
were
probably
in
the
neighborhood
of
400,000
or
500,000
registered
voters.
the
second
thing
it
did
was
to
require
that
these
signatures
be
submitted
at
a
much
earlier
date
than
formerly.
the
former
practice
--
former
statute,
3260,
had
provided
that
the
required
signatures
be
submitted
40
days
before
the
general
election,
in
practical
effect,
the
end
of
september.
the
new
regulation
--
the
new
statute
required
that
the
signatures
be
submitted
at
the
same
time
as
one
would
qualify
for
running
in
the
party
primary.
now,
the
statutes
governing
running
in
party
primaries
require
that
60
days
before
the
primary
a
candidate
submit
his
intent
--
notice
of
his
intention
to
run
and
a
filing
fee
of
a
small
amount
to
the
executive
committee
--
executive
secretary
of
his
party
which
means
that,
under
the
new
statute,
whereas
someone
wanting
to
run
in
a
party
primary
had
to
submit
by
some
date
in
april,
say,
$100
or
$200
plus
a
notice
of
intention
to
run.
reverent
whitley
or
whoever
was
govern
--
whoever
wished
to
run
as
an
independent
had
to
submit
petitions
with
10,000
or
some-lesser
number
of
signatures,
depending
on
what
office
was
involved.
the
third
and,
in
some
ways,
the
most
significant
effect
was
to
impose
a
new
requirement
that
one
who
had
voted
in
a
party
primary
could
not,
thereafter,
run
as
an
independent.
finally,
the
new
stat
--
mr.
armand
derfner
no,
i
think
the
statute
means
that
one
who
has
voted
in
the
primary
that
year
for
--
mr.
armand
derfner
the
primary
--
mr.
armand
derfner
the
primary
for
which
--
for
the
same
office
for
which
he
is
running.
mr.
armand
derfner
that's
right.
mr.
armand
derfner
i'm
not
familiar
with
that,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
i
do
know
that
that
was
not
the
provision
in
mississippi
before
and
there
had
been
a
number
of
instances
of
people
being
unsuccessful
in
primaries
and
running
in
general
elections.
there's
a
case
called
bowen
versus
williams
which
was
cited
in
the
brief,
in
which
precisely
that
happened.
and,
the
supreme
court
of
mississippi
held
that
there
was
no
impediment
to
that
being
done.
mr.
armand
derfner
that's
right.
there
is
a
section
3129
in
the
mississippi
code
which
imposes
a
pledge
of
loyalty
to
anyon
--
on
anyone
voting
in
a
party
primary,
but
that's
been
held
not
to
be
enforceable
in
connection
with
his
running
as
an
independent
candidate.
that
was
the
case
that
i
was
referring
to.
mr.
armand
derfner
if
you
have
voted
--
mr.
armand
derfner
that's
right.
mr.
armand
derfner
there
is
no
prohibition
in
the
statute
against
running
as
an
independent
if
you
have
merely
run
but
not
voted
in
the
primary.
nonetheless,
one
of
the
record
shows
that
at
least
one
of
the
people
who
was
kept
off
the
ballot
in
1967
was
kept
off
because
he
had
run
in
the
primary,
though
not
voted.
we
d
--
that
does
not
appear
to
be,
however,
what
the
statute
says.
mr.
armand
derfner
no,
we
believe,
your
honor,
and
in
fact
we
--
i
don't
think
we'd
be
here
if
we
did
not
believe
that
this
was
a
statute
that
violates
the
fifteenth
amendment
of
the
united
states.
we
believe
that
--
mr.
armand
derfner
no,
your
honor.
all
that
is
before
you
is
whether
this
is
a
law
with
--
a
law
that
imposes
a
voting
prerequisite
or
qualification
or
standard
practice
of
procedure
with
respect
to
voting.
if
you
decide
that
it
is,
then
the
statute
cannot,
could
not
have
been,
and
cannot
be
put
into
effect
until
the
federal
clearance
either
through
the
attorney
general
--
mr.
armand
derfner
that
is
the
sole
issue.
mr.
armand
derfner
the
fifteenth
amendment
was
in
our
pleading.
mr.
armand
derfner
we
took
it
out,
justice
marshall,
because
we
--
in
1967
when
this
case
came
up
for
the
second
time,
the
case
came
up
in
september,
we
did
not
believe
we
had
enough
time
at
that
point
to
put
on
a
case
with
respect
to
the
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
amendments.
and
so,
at
that
time,
though
the
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
amendment
claims
remained
in
the
case,
and
they
do
remain
in
the
case,
now,
we
entered
a
stipulation
with
the
appellees,
with
the
attorney
general,
that
the
only
issue
before
the
district
court
at
that
time
was
the
issue
of
section
5.
this
means,
by
the
way,
that
we
would
maintain
that
the
constitutional
issues
are
still
in
the
case
that
section
2281
did
and
does
apply
and
that,
wholly
apart
from
any
question
of
section
5,
we
were
and
are
entitled
to
a
three-judge
court
and,
therefore,
that
this
court
would
have
jurisdiction
by
direct
appeal.
we
did
not
mean,
in
any
way,
to
take
the
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
amendment
issues
out
of
the
case,
and
we
believe,
in
fact,
that
we
could
prove
that
if
we
were
put
to
it.
mr.
armand
derfner
pardon
me,
your
honor?
mr.
armand
derfner
the
stipulation,
which
is
in
the
record
at
--
it's
an
appendix
to
the
opinion
of
the
three-judge
court
appearing
on
page
39
of
the
record
here,
paragraph
5,
that
the
only
issue
before
the
court
at
this
time
is
whether
or
not
house
bill
68,
amended
section
3260,
is
an
attempt
by
the
state
of
mississippi
to
enact
or
seek
to
enact
to
administer
any
voting
law
within
the
meaning
of
section
5.
there's
nothing
in
the
stipulation
and
nothing
else
anywhere
in
the
case
that
indicates
that
the
constitutional
issues
are
no
longer
in
the
case.
the
final
requirement
of
the
new
section
3260
was
that
every
vote
--
every
signature
on
the
petition
had
to
be
in
the
petitioner's
own
hand
--
own
handwriting.
and,
while
it's
not
clear
--
while
this
specific
provision
has
not
been
at
issue
or
been
the
specific
issue
involved
in
any
of
the
cases
in
the
record
and
it's
not
clear
just
how
far
this
goes,
we
think
it
is
open
to
the
interpretation,
and
a
fatal
interpretation,
that
this
require
--
that
this
would
prohibit
illiterates
from
signing
petitions
on
behalf
of
independent
candidates.
after
the
statute
was
passed,
reverent
whitley
and
two
others
who
were
kept
off
the
ballot
submitted
petitions
to
run
as
independent
candidates
in
the
fall
of
1966.
they
were
ruled
off
the
ballot
not
because
they
had
not
complied
in
time
or
because
they
had
voted
in
the
primary
as
to
both
of
which
this
would've
been
an
expos
facto
law,
but
because
they
had
not
submitted
sufficient
signatures.
at
that
point,
in
the
fall
of
1966,
we
filed
this
suit
on
--
as
a
class
action
on
behalf
of
reverent
whitley
and
the
two
others
in
their
capacity,
both
as
voters
and
as
candidates,
and
the
three-judge
court
at
that
time,
without
going
into
any
of
the
statutory
or
constitutional
issues,
as
an
exercise
of
its
equity,
jurisdiction,
and
discretion
ruled
that
these
three
candidates
should
be
placed
on
the
ballot.
in
1967,
the
situation
arose
again,
and
at
that
point,
as
the
record
shows,
there
were
at
least
16
candidates
ranging
from
people
who
were
running
for
justice
of
the
peace
in
various
counties,
all
the
way
to
mrs.
fannie
lou
hamer
who
sought
to
run
for
state
senate
from
sunflower
county
who
had
been
ruled
off
the
ballot.
i
should
mention
that
the
1967
elections
were
the
statewide
elections
in
which
virtually
all
state
offices
were
being
chosen.
this
was
the
first
time
in
modern
history
that
any
substantial
number
of
negro
candidates
had
run
or
sought
to
run.
it
was
also
the
first
time
in
modern
history
that
any
--
that,
with
the
exception
of
a
single
negro
community
in
mississippi,
that
any
negro
candidates
have
been
elected.
these
16
people
or
more
were
kept
off
the
ballot
for
various
reasons,
although
they
had
complied
or
would've
complied
with
the
old
provisions
of
section
3260.
at
that
time,
we
brought
the
suit
on
again
and,
this
time,
the
three-judge
court
ruled
against
us.
and,
it
was
from
that
decision
which
held
essentially
that
section
3260
dealt
only
with
elections
or
with
candidates
but
not
with
voting,
that
this
appeal
was
taken.
the
point
of
this
appeal,
we
submit,
is
very
much
like
the
point
in
williams
versus
roads
decided
by
this
court
yesterday
in
which
the
court
said
dealt
--
dealing
with
the
right
of
the
american
independent
party
to
be
on
the
ballot,
spoke
of
the
ohio
provision
as
a
burden
on
the
right
of
qualified
voters
regardless
of
their
political
persuasion
to
cast
their
votes
effectively.
i
think
it's
significant
that
section
3260
is
the
first
--
one
of
the
first
major
attempts
by
the
state
of
mississippi
to
deal
in
any
significant
way
with
the
problem
of
general
elections.
mississippi,
is
perhaps
the
most
or
certainly
one
of
the
most
confirmed
of
the
one-party
states
of
this
nation,
has
always
paid
a
great
deal
of
attention
to
regulation
of
primary
elections
than
to
regulation
of
general
elections.
the
two
outstanding
examples
of
that
are
the
corrupt
practices
act
which,
in
mississippi,
applies
only
to
primary
elections
and
not
to
general
elections
and
the
requirement
of
the
runoff
which,
again,
applies
only
to
primary
elections
and
not
to
general
elections.
the
tradition
in
mississippi
has
always
been
that
whoever
wins
the
primary
is
essentially
the
winner
of
the
general
election.
in
most
cases
or
many
cases
in
recent
history,
there
has
not
been
any
opposition
at
the
general
elections.
at
the
same
time,
with
the
passage
of
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965,
a
new
factor
came
into
mississippi
politics
and
this
was
the
negro
voter.prior
to
1965,
various
figures
in
the
reports
of
the
united
states
civil
rights
commission,
other
figures
indicated
that
something
like
7%
of
the
eligible
negro
voters
in
mississippi
were
registered
to
vote.
after
the
--
mr.
armand
derfner
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
armand
derfner
yes,
justice
harlan.
mr.
armand
derfner
no,
because
we
--
mr.
armand
derfner
we
believe
that
section
5
was
intended
to
cover
to
be
every
bit
as
broad
as
the
fifteenth
amendment
itself,
that
when
congress
passed
the
voting
rights
of
--
act
of
1965
they
knew
full
well
that
this
was
--
that
they
had
been
relatively
unsuccessful
in
guaranteeing
the
provisions
of
the
fifteenth
amendment
before
that.
they
had
tried
in
1957,
in
1960,
and
in
1964.
we
believe
that
what
congress
sought
to
do
in
1965
was
to
ensure
that
they
would
not
have
to
pass
a
voting
rights
act
of
1966
because
they
knew
that
on
each
occasion,
when
they
had
passed
legislation
before
that,
the
states
that
they
were
aiming
at
had
then
come
up
with
another
new
provision
that
had
not
been
covered
by
the
act.
and
so,
we
think
that
section
5
was
passed
very
broadly
in
order
to
cover
everything
possible
that
could
be
covered
the
fifteenth
amendment.
mr.
armand
derfner
section
--
well,
section
5
would
--
the
final
determination
of
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia
would
cover
only
things
that
were
--
no,
let
me
put
it
this
way.
with
the
exception
of
the
placing
of
the
burden
of
proof,
i
believe
that
section
5
would
be
the
same
as
the
--
would
cover
only
or
would
prohibit
after
clearance
only
things
that
were
in
violation
of
the
fifteenth
amendment.
in
other
words
--
mr.
armand
derfner
right,
a
good
faith
--
mr.
armand
derfner
a
good
faith
--
mr.
armand
derfner
no.
well,
it
would
come
under
section
5
in
the
sense
that
it
would
have
to
be
cleared
--
mr.
armand
derfner
under
provisions
of
section
5.
i
took
justice
harlan's
question
to
indicate
what
would
be
clear
to
what
would
not
be
clear
under
section
5,
and
a
good
faith
literacy
test
would
be
cleared
since
it
would
not
--
mr.
armand
derfner
i
think
the
kind
of
question
that
has
to
go
to
the
district
of
columbia
court
is
any
question
relating
to
voting,
whether
it
discriminates
or
not.
mr.
armand
derfner
that's
right.
mr.
armand
derfner
yes,
justice
white.
we
think
that
reapportionment
is
one
of
the
most
significant
examples
of
this.
any
situation
in
which
the
state
does
anything
which
has
the
potential
of
depriving
somebody
of
the
right
to
vote
on
base
of
race
or
abridging
--
mr.
armand
derfner
not
all
reapportionment
cases,
justice
white.
i
think
mr.
lichtman
will
be
dealing
in
somewhat
more
detail
with
the
reapportionment
question.
mr.
armand
derfner
only
reapportionment
cases
from
the
covered
states
--
mr.
armand
derfner
would
be
going
through.
mr.
armand
derfner
all
those
rea
--
mr.
armand
derfner
that's
true.
every
reapportionment
case
would
have
to
be
passed
on
not
--
but
not
necessarily
by
the
district
of
columbia
court.
in
most
cases,
it
could
be
done,
and
i
believe
it
has
been
done
--
mr.
armand
derfner
by
the
attorney
general.
and,
i
think
the
attorney
general's
information
indicates
that
there
had
been
a
great
number
of
submissions
of
reapportionment
plans
and
that
all
of
these
have
been
approved.
so
that,
in
most
--
and
we
think
it's
quite
proper
that
where
you
have
a
reapportionment
plan,
you
have
the
best
--
you
have,
in
a
sense,
the
most
convenient
opportunity
for
a
state
to
discriminate
with
re
--
in
voting
with
respect
by
--
on
the
basis
of
race
in
a
way
that
seems
innocent.
and,
we
believe
that
where
that
is
in
fact
innocent,
that
there
will
be
no
trouble,
and
where
it
is
not
in
fact
innocent,
that
is
perfectly
proper
to
have
the
state
be
required
to
pass
muster
by
submitting
it
to
the
attorney
general
and,
if
he
disapproves,
to
decla
--
to
seeking
declaratory
judgment
in
the
district
of
columbia.
mr.
armand
derfner
my
own
case,
number
36,
will
be
covered
by
standard
practice
or
procedure
with
respect
to
voting.
we
think
that
--
mr.
armand
derfner
yes,
we
think
that,
as
in
williams
versus
roads,
the
question
of
who
gets
on
the
ballot
is
so
closely
related
to
the
question
of
who
the
voter
can
vote
for
and
how
he
can
make
his
vote
effective,
that
it
is
a
question
of
standard
practice
or
procedure
with
respect
to
voting.
mr.
armand
derfner
pardon
me,
justice
harlan?
mr.
armand
derfner
i
believe
it
does,
justice
harlan.
that
if,
for
example
--
mr.
armand
derfner
i
think
it
would
cover
that,
justice
harlan.
that,
again,
is
a
sort
of
question
that
should
be
submitted
to
the
attorney
general.
i
think,
quite
possibly
in
that
situation,
if
they
were
not
a
racial
cast
to
it,
that
that's
the
sort
of
thing
that
the
attorney
general
would
approve.
mr.
armand
derfner
no,
i
think
a
statute
like
that
should
be
submitted,
that
it
is
covered
by
section
5.
you
can
think
of
the
example,
suppose
--
take
the
grandfather
clause
case
for
this
court
when
--
and
its
progeny.
suppose
the
statute
said
not
simply
that
one
who
is
the
--
was
eligible
to
vote
in
1867
was
the
ancestor
of
one
who
was
eligible
to
vote
may
vote
without
registering,
one
who
is
not
may
not.
suppose
the
statute
said
one
who
was
eligible
to
vote
in
1867
may
run
for
office
as
an
independent
or
may
run
for
office,
if
he
was
not
so
eligible
to
vote
or
his
ancestor
was
not
then
he
may
not
run
for
office.
we
think
that's
precisely
the
sort
of
thing
that
is
covered
by
section
5.
i
might
say
in
this
connection
that
the
appellees
have
talked
about
the
language
of
section
5
as
being
somewhat
narrower.
they've
talked
about
the
use
of
the
word
"comply"
in
the
second
sentence
of
section
5,
and
they've
said
"unless
and
until
the
clearance
is
obtained,
no
person
shall
be
denied
the
right
to
vote
for
failure
to
comply."
we
think,
there,
that
the
words
"comply"
were
not
intended
to
be
and
should
not
be
read
as
limiting
the
terms
"voting
standard,
practice,
procedure,
prerequisite,
or
qualification."
the
word
comply,taken
in
its
most
logical
sense
there,
would
apply
to
the
qualification
or
prerequisite.
it
would
not
be
an
act
limiting
phrase
with
respect
to
the
phrases
"standard
practice
or
procedure"
which
were
inserted
in
the
act
after
its
introduction.
for
example,
we
can
think
of
examples
that
i
think
would,
even
more
clearly
than
these
cases,
be
covered
by
this
--
by
section
5
as
to
which
the
word
"comply"
would
not
be
an
appropriate
word,
and
these
have
to
do,
for
example,
with
various
actions
of
the
election
officials.
for
example,
chan
--
a
law
changing
the
counting
of
the
ballots
from
a
public
counting
to
a
secret
counting,
or
a
law
changing
the
polling
places
from
public
buildings
or
public
places
to
private
places,
thus,
allowing
polling
places
to
be
held
in
--
on
plantations
or
stores
or
what
have
you
or,
for
example,
a
law
that
abolish
the
use
of
poll
watchers.
all
these,
i
believe,
it
would
clearly
come
within
section
5
and
these
do
not
fit
as
clearly
within
the
use
of
the
word
"comply."
i
think
those
are
good
examples
showing
why
the
word
"comply"
should
not
be
read
as
limiting
the
statute.
i
think
the
coverage
of
section
5
is
the
fact
that
all
these
statutes
may
have
to
be
submitted
for
approval
is
not
one
that
should
be
regarded
as
a
reason
to
narrow
the
scope
of
section
5.
certainly,
it's
strong
medicine
but
congress
knew
when
it
passed
section
5
that
it
was
dealing
with
a
virulent
disease
and
the
very
fact
that
great
numbers
of
submissions
have
come
to
the
attorney
general
from
--
in
almost
every
case
from
states
other
than
mississippi,
i
think,
indicates
that
congress
meant
for
the
easy
statutes,
the
obvious
statutes,
the
statues
that
were
constitutional
to
sail
through,
and
they
have
sailed
through,
but
congress
meant
to
put
a
block
on
the
states
from
monkeying
around
with
the
fifteenth
amendment
from
doing
the
things
that
they
have
been
doing
that
previous
statutes
had
failed
to
curve,
and
--
mr.
armand
derfner
i
think
the
attorney
general's
records
indicate,
according
to
my
information,
that
only
one
matter
has
ever
been
submitted
from
the
state
of
mississippi
and
that
was
not
done
by
the
state
of
mississippi
but
by
the
board
of
supervisors
of
a
single
county.
mr.
armand
derfner
may
it
please
the
court.
the
position
of
all
the
appellants
on
the
question
of
relief
is
as
follows.
we
believe
that
section
5
imposed
an
additional
requirement
for
putting
into
effect
a
state
statute
within
its
coverage
that,
in
the
absence
of
fulfilling
that
requirement,
the
statute
was
not
in
effect
and
it
was
as
if
no
statute
had
been
passed.
therefore,
we
believe
that,
since
the
statutes
in
these
cases
have
been
void
and
are
now
void,
that
we
are
entitled
to
new
elections
that
are
retrospective
relief
as
well
as
prospective
relief
the
day
this
court
reverses
the
judgments
below.
at
that
point,
the
proper
relief
would
be
for
the
court
to
remand
to
the
court
below
for
new
elections.
we
don't
think
it's
the
job
of
this
court
or
the
court
below
to
tell
the
state
what
to
do
about
whom
to
submit
the
statute
to,
about
whether
to
submit
the
statute
at
all,
or
about
what
to
do
if
it
wishes
to
put
the
statute
into
effect.
if
the
state
wishes
to
submit
the
statute
to
somebody
and
come
back
to
the
court
below
before
such
time
as
is
fixed
promptly
for
holding
a
new
election,
then
that
court
might,
within
the
exercise
of
its
equitable
discretion,
decide
to,
if
there
were
a
favorable
determination,
favorable
to
the
state,
might
decide
not
to
hold
the
new
election.
but,
we
think
that
the
state
--
the
court
below
should
proceed
expeditiously
to
hold
new
elections,
that
those
new
elections
should
be
held
and
--
mr.
armand
derfner
yes.
mr.
armand
derfner
yes,
but
at
the
time
these
cases
were
brought,
in
each
case,
the
proper
thing
for
the
court
below
to
have
done
and
the
convenient
thing
in
all
cases
would've
been
to
grasp
the
--
mr.
armand
derfner
that's
right.
mr.
armand
derfner
yes,
i
do,
but
i
think
that,
as
hamer
against
campbell,
a
fifth
circuit
case,
says,
one
of
the
considerations
in
exercising
the
equity
jurisdiction
of
a
court
is
how
difficult
it
would
have
been
at
that
time,
how
disruptive
it
is
now.
and,
we
think
it
is
quite
within
the
equity
jurisdiction
of
this
court
and
the
court
below,
and
would
be
the
proper
remedy
to
order
to
go
back
to
the
situation
as
it
stood
at
that
time.
otherwise,
we
think
the
rights
are
--
mr.
armand
derfner
yes,
we
do.
mr.
armand
derfner
that's
right.
mr.
armand
derfner
i
think,
mr.
chief
justice,
we
have
to
look
at
what
the
statute
was
meant
to
do.
the
submission
to
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia
or
to
the
attorney
general
was
not
regarded
as
a
formalistic
matter.
it
was
regarded
as
something
of
--
mr.
armand
derfner
not
regarded
as
a
formalistic
matter.
it
was
regarded
to
something
--
mr.
armand
derfner
no,
it
was
regarded
to
something
of
great
substance.
it
was
regarded
as
a
way
of
making
certain
that
this
statute
has
--
had,
as
close
as
possible
to
automatic
effect,
as
we
said
in
south
carolina
versus
katzenbach.
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
congress,
in
seeking
to
pass,
an
--
as
automatic
as
possible,
a
trigger
statute,
would've
meant
to
allow
these
rights
to
be
delayed
for
so
long.
i
might
say
--
what
i
was
trying
to
say
before
in
connection
with
the
lower
court's
equity
jurisdiction
is
that
the
--
if
the
court
orders
new
elections,
i
should
think
that
if
the
state
in
the
interim
were
to
go
to
the
attorney
general
and
get
a
favorable
determination
before
those
new
elections
took
place,
it
would
be
well
within
the
equitable
jurisdiction
of
the
court
below
to
set
aside
the
order
for
new
elections.
all
i'm
saying
is
that
the
court's
procedure
should
go
on
and
not
--
and
whatever
can
be
done
by
the
state
within
such
seasonable
time
as
exists
before
the
election
which,
almost
certainly,
would
include
time
to
get
a
favorable
response
if
one
were
forthcoming
from
the
attorney
general,
could
be
effective.
but,
i
don't
think
that
the
court
should
wait
until
the
state
has
a
chance
to
seek
a
declaratory
judgment
in
the
district
of
columbia
then
appeal
that
to
this
court.
by
that
time,
what
we've
had
is
close
to
the
five
years
of
the
operation
of
the
statute,
eaten
up
by
the
state's
recalcitrance,
and
i
don't
think
that's
what
congress
intended.
mr.
armand
derfner
no,
your
honor,
i
believe
this
court's
proper
order
should
call
--
should
direct
the
court
below
to
call
for
new
elections.
what
the
state
wishes
to
do
in
the
way
of
submission
or
to
whom
it
wishes
to
submit
is
up
to
the
state.
if
the
state
wishes
to
submit,
it
may
do
so.
if
it
gets
an
answer
back
in
time
before
the
election
and
it
certainly
would
have
time
to,
that's
fine.
if
the
state
does
not
wish
to
submit
and
it
might
decide,
for
example
in
the
bunton
case,
that
it
doesn't
wish
to
submit,
then
it's
not
up
to
this
court
or
the
court
below
to
tell
--
to
suggest
to
the
state
what
it
should
do
to
put
--
to
comply
with
its
obligations
under
section
5.
mr.
armand
derfner
no,
because
i
think,
in
that
event,
if
the
court
below
decided
that,
in
its
equitable
discretion,
that
the
approval,
even
at
this
late
date,
indicated
that
the
state's
error
was,
in
effect,
harmless,
i
think
that
would
be
quite
consistent
with
this
court's
mandate
because
it
would
say
that
this
great
duty
of
the
state,
this
not
merely
formalistic
duty,
though
it
had
not
been
done
before,
had
been
done
now
in
a
way
that
showed
that
the
statute
was
proper
and
could
be
put
into
effect.
what
we're
talking
about
--
in
a
sense,
some
of
these
things
don't
fit
tightly
into
logical
boxes,
but
we
think
they
were
talking
about
the
most
practical
way
of
solving
the
statute
and
petition
the
rights
--
mr.
armand
derfner
the
problem
was
--
mr.
armand
derfner
no,
justice
fortas.
mr.
armand
derfner
not
quite,
because
we're
willing
to
do
that
in
connection
with
the
attorney
general,
submission
to
the
attorney
general,
because,
as
a
practical
matter,
there'd
be
a
chance
--
there'd
be
time
to
get
a
response
from
the
attorney
general
before
any
new
election
were
held,
and
we're
willing
to
do
that
because
we
don't
believe
that
would
hold
anything
up.
we're
not
willing,
though,
to
agree
that
that
relief
should
be
held
up
until
a
submission
to
the
--
mr.
armand
derfner
we
think
the
baseline,
justice
fortas,
is
that
the
state
is
not
entitled
to
put
the
statute
in
effect,
that
the
statech
ha
--
state
had
no
statute
until
such
time
as
it
complied.
we
think
that
a
court
has
equitable
discretion
to
essentially
give
the
state
more
than
it's
entitled
to,
but
not
where
that
might
result
in
frustrating
appellant's
rights
for
an
additional
year
or
two.
