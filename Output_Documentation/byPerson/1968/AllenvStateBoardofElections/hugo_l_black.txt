instead
of
delegating
his
authority
to
the
attorney

he
had
delegated
it
to
the
chief
justice
of
the
united

to

what
would
you
say
about
that?
justice

black
of
course,
marbury
versus
madison
held
it
was
this
court
who
had
judicial
review,
not
the
attorney
general.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
instead
of
the
district
of
columbia
the
act
had
said
the
first
--
the
district
court
in
maine.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that
would
be
alright,
wouldn't
it,
the
district
court
in
maine?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
suppose
you
propose
another
section
by
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
some
issue
in
maine,
all
the
laws
become
effective
in
maine.
they
must
be
submitted
to
a
district
judge
in
mississippi.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
could.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
agree
with
you.
if
it
can
do
this,
it
can
do
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that,
you
say,
would
have
to
be
submitted
to
the
attorney
general.
justice
hugo
l.

what
relief
is
asked?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
to
submit
to
the
attorney

justice
hugo
l.
black
but
then,
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
election
was
this?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
would
they
have
to
waive
them
until
the
attorney
general
passes
on
it
and
then
it's
attacked
at
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
court
of
appeals,
then
it
comes
to
us?
by
that
time,
it
probably
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
if
he
did?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
can
the
court
of
appeals
review
the
district
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
what
i
thought.
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
could
that
be
done
before
the
court
rules
on
it?
do
you
mean
that
the
act
authorizes
the
attorney
general
void
a
statement
that
is
bad
to
notify
the
state
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
make
the
judgment.
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
can't
command
a
final
judgment,
can
he,
that
the
state
law
is
void?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
suppose
he
renders
and
says
it's
void,
is
that
filed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
get
them
to
approve
the
law
as
constitutional.
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
constitutional
or
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
result
being
if
it's
either
constitutional
or
unconstitutional.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
mean
if
the
attorney
general
objects,
we
won't
let
any
court
rule
on
it
at
all?
they've
got
to
set
it
down
then
and
have
a
new
election?
justice
hugo
l.
black
no
court
ever
holds
this.
it's
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
result
of
that
is
that
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states,
who
is
not
a
judge,
who
is
not
in
court,
can
object
to
any
state
law,
it's
election
law,
and
he
can
immediately
require
that
state
to
have
another
election,
is
that
right?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
what
i
understood
you
to
say.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
talking
about
extraordinary
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
any
extraordinary
thing.
the
constitution
is
an
extraordinary
thing.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
didn't
go
so
far
as
to
hold,
but
you're
saying
now
that
the
effect
of
the
attorney
g
--
of
submitting
it
to
the
attorney
general,
and
he's
holding
it
there,
that
immediately
requires
the
state
to
hold
a
new
election.
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
means
that
the
attorney
general
is
permitted
to
pass
without
submitting
to
any
court
on
the
legality
of
a
state
law.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
that,
but
you
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
the
situation
is
like
i
said,
isn't
it?
it
gives
the
attorney
general
the
power,
if
he
holds
the
thing
is
bad,
that
that
is
binding
on
the
state
and
it
must
have
a
new
election
right
away.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
is
that
what
it
would
be?
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
determine
it
was
not
a
violation
of
the
fifteenth
amendment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
say
someone
--
until
someone
had
reviewed
it
to
determine
whether
it
was
a
violation
of
the
fifteenth
amendment,
who
was
there
to
review
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
your
judgment,
did
the
case
of
south
carolina
and
katzenbach
merely
approve
the
constitutionality
of
the
law
as
far
as
it
went
or
do
you
say
that
that
case
require
that
we
hope
that
it
governs
however
that
law
is
applied?
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
the
extent
of
what,
anyway
it's
applied?
justice
hugo
l.
black
any
application?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
only
ruled
it
was
constitutional
in
so
far
as
it
required
it
to
be
submitted,
isn't
it?
did
it
hold
what
the
effect
was
or
could
it
hold
that
at
that
time,
however
it
was
applied,
it
was
constitutional,
the
means
of
application?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
it
held
in
that
case
that
it
would
be
unconstitutional
to
be,
the
result,
not
submitting
it
to
the
attorney
general
or
his
saying
it
was
bad,
that
that
would
nullify
state
elections?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
that
was
held?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
believe
it
hold
it.
that
wasn't
the
issue.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
whatever
he
held.
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
it
without
any
court
passing
on
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
attorney
general
could
freeze
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
the
act
said,
as
i
understand
it,
not
that
it
did
but
the
one
submitted
to
the
attorney
general.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
have
no
doubt
about
what
they
intended.
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
they
settle
the
constitutionality
of
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
applied.
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
that
case,
on
those
facts
to
the
extent
that
it
was
applied
in
that
way?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
it
--
do
you
think
in
that
opinion,
the
court
would
actually
begin
to
hold
that
anyway
it's
applied
would
be
legal,
constitutional?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
don't
think
that,
do
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
it
had
--
their
principle
was
so
that
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states,
a
prosecutorial
officer
who
is
not
a
judge,
look
at
it
and
see
if
he
thought
it
violated
the
fifteenth
amendment,
wasn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
or
would
violate
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
it
was
the
objective
of
the
congress
to
suspend
any
new
law
and
leave
the
old
mississippi
laws
that
had
been
on
the
books
a
long
time
in
effect?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
wouldn't
it,
if
the
constitution
prevented
it
in
maine
than
it
more
does
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
constitutionally
speaking,
what's
the
difference?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
a
district
court
of
the
united
states
is
a
district
court
of
the
united
states?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
asking
you
these
questions
with
any
idea,
believing
the
idea
on
your
part,
that
i
think
congress
is
allowed
full
power
to
pass
its
own
laws
and
to
have
its
courts
judge
of
their
constitutionality.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
quite
different,
however,
to
the
question
i'm
asking
you.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
attorney
general
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
it's
to
suspend
the
laws,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
the
action
of
mississippi
in
1965
or
1966
was
suspended
by
congress
in
an
act
passed
in
1964?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
committed
them
to
the
tender
measures
of
the
old
mississippi
laws?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
suppose
that
congress
didn't
sanctify
the
old
mississippi
laws.
they
were
still
open
to
attack
in
the
courts,
were
they
not,
by
everybody
who
was
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
took
care
of
the
device,
didn't
they?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
say
they
suspended
the
new
--
any
new
law
and
left
the
old
laws
in
effect.
a
suspension
would
do
that,
wouldn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
would
sanctify
the
old
law
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
for
that
time,
wouldn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
it
was
a
fact
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
held
back
in
the
courts.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
you
say
you
suspended
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
any
new
changes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
would
be
perfectly
satisfied
with
your
argument
if
congress
had
held
that
certain
things
were
devices
and
put
it
in
an
act.
what
disturbs
me
is
that
that
should
be
applied
by
congress
delegating
their
powers,
at
least
for
a
time,
to
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
could
it
be,
except
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
whether
the
suspension
could
be
lifted.
justice
hugo
l.
black
until
that
time,
the
suspension
was
in
effect
by
reason
of
the
determination
of
the
attorney
general
of
what
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
if
you
say
congress
authorized
him
to
do
it,
how
are
you
going
to
draw
a
distinction?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
suspends
it
on
condition.
justice
hugo
l.
black
isn't
that
what
it
suspended
on
condition?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
if
it
had
said
that
unconditionally,
you'd
have
a
different
case,
wouldn't
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
do?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
think
that
it
says
unconditionally
and
that,
here,
if
the
attorney
generals
were
not
in
that
we
could
construe
that
act
as
suspending
every
effort
of
a
state
to
amend
its
election
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
confused.
do
you
think
that
--
the
question
i
asked,
can
you
answer
that
one?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
even
though
the
section
was
not
bad
and
he'd
been
given
no
power,
do
you
think
this
court
could
honestly
read
that
act
as
providing
that
no
state
should
change
its
election
law
or
any
southern
state,
i
think
they
were
careful
not
to
touch
it
in
the
other,
that
any
southern
state
is
barred
from
changing
any
of
its
election
laws
that
they
have
until
--
indefinitely.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
it
suspends
it
for
five
years
without
any
action
on
the
part
of
the
attorney
general?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
that
the
act
would
mean
that
if
the
attorney
general
section
were
out?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
if
that's
true,
the
congress
then,
you
say,
froze
all
the
election
laws
of
the
south
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
for
five
years?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
couldn't
pass
any
for
five
years.
now,
that
would
raise
a
different
question
in
my
mind.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
can't
quite
read
it
that
way.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose,
instead
of
delegating
his
authority
to
the
attorney
general,
he
had
delegated
it
to
the
chief
justice
of
the
united

justice

black
it
could.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
agree
with
you.
if
it
can
do
this,
it
can
do
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that,
you
say,
would
have
to
be
submitted
to
the

is
asked?

review

that's
what
i
thought.

how
could
that
be

do
you

you

merely
approve
the
constitutionality
of
the
law
as
far
as
it
went
or
do
you
say
that
that
case
require
that
we
hope
that
it
governs
however
that

is
applied?
justice

black
to
the
extent
of
what,
anyway
it's
applied?
justice
hugo

black
any
application?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
only
ruled
it
was
constitutional
in
so
far
as
it
required
it
to
be
submitted,
isn't
it?
did
it
hold
what
the
effect
was
or
could
it
hold
that
at
that
time,
however
it
was
applied,
it
was
constitutional,
the
means
of
application?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
it
held
in
that
case
that
it
would
be
unconstitutional
to
be,
the
result,
not
submitting
it
to
the
attorney
general
or
his
saying
it
was
bad,
that
that
would
nullify
state
elections?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
that
was
held?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
believe
it
hold
it.
that
wasn't
the
issue.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
whatever
he
held.
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
it
without
any
court
passing
on
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
attorney
general
could
freeze
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
the
act
said,
as
i
understand
it,
not
that
it
did
but
the
one
submitted
to
the
attorney
general.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
have
no
doubt
about
what
they
intended.
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
they
settle
the
constitutionality
of
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
applied.
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
that
case,
on
those
facts
to
the
extent
that
it
was
applied
in
that
way?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
it
--
do
you
think
in
that
opinion,
the
court
would
actually
begin
to
hold
that
anyway
it's
applied
would
be
legal,
constitutional?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
don't
think
that,
do
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
it
had
--
their
principle
was
so
that
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states,
a
prosecutorial
officer
who
is
not
a
judge,
look
at
it
and
see
if
he
thought
it
violated
the
fifteenth
amendment,
wasn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
or
would
violate
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
it
was
the
objective
of
the
congress
to
suspend
any
new
law
and
leave
the
old
mississippi
laws
that
had
been
on
the
books
a
long
time
in
effect?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
wouldn't
it,
if
the
constitution
prevented
it
in
maine
than
it
more
does
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
constitutionally
speaking,
what's
the
difference?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
a
district
court
of
the
united
states
is
a
district
court
of
the
united
states?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
asking
you
these
questions
with
any
idea,
believing
the
idea
on
your
part,
that
i
think
congress
is
allowed
full
power
to
pass
its
own
laws
and
to
have
its
courts
judge
of
their
constitutionality.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
quite
different,
however,
to
the
question
i'm
asking
you.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
attorney
general
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
it's
to
suspend
the
laws,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
the
action
of
mississippi
in
1965
or
1966
was
suspended
by
congress
in
an
act
passed
in
1964?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
committed
them
to
the
tender
measures
of
the
old
mississippi
laws?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
suppose
that
congress
didn't
sanctify
the
old
mississippi
laws.
they
were
still
open
to
attack
in
the
courts,
were
they
not,
by
everybody
who
was
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
took
care
of
the
device,
didn't
they?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
say
they
suspended
the
new
--
any
new
law
and
left
the
old
laws
in
effect.
a
suspension
would
do
that,
wouldn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
would
sanctify
the
old
law
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
for
that
time,
wouldn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
it
was
a
fact
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
held
back
in
the
courts.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
you
say
you
suspended
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
any
new
changes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
would
be
perfectly
satisfied
with
your
argument
if
congress
had
held
that
certain
things
were
devices
and
put
it
in
an
act.
what
disturbs
me
is
that
that
should
be
applied
by
congress
delegating
their
powers,
at
least
for
a
time,
to
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
could
it
be,
except
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
whether
the
suspension
could
be
lifted.
justice
hugo
l.
black
until
that
time,
the
suspension
was
in
effect
by
reason
of
the
determination
of
the
attorney
general
of
what
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
if
you
say
congress
authorized
him
to
do
it,
how
are
you
going
to
draw
a
distinction?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
suspends
it
on
condition.
justice
hugo
l.
black
isn't
that
what
it
suspended
on
condition?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
if
it
had
said
that
unconditionally,
you'd
have
a
different
case,
wouldn't
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
do?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
think
that
it
says
unconditionally
and
that,
here,
if
the
attorney
generals
were
not
in
that
we
could
construe
that
act
as
suspending
every
effort
of
a
state
to
amend
its
election
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
confused.
do
you
think
that
--
the
question
i
asked,
can
you
answer
that
one?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
even
though
the
section
was
not
bad
and
he'd
been
given
no
power,
do
you
think
this
court
could
honestly
read
that
act
as
providing
that
no
state
should
change
its
election
law
or
any
southern
state,
i
think
they
were
careful
not
to
touch
it
in
the
other,
that
any
southern
state
is
barred
from
changing
any
of
its
election
laws
that
they
have
until
--
indefinitely.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
it
suspends
it
for
five
years
without
any
action
on
the
part
of
the
attorney
general?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
that
the
act
would
mean
that
if
the
attorney
general
section
were
out?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
if
that's
true,
the
congress
then,
you
say,
froze
all
the
election
laws
of
the
south
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
for
five
years?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
couldn't
pass
any
for
five
years.
now,
that
would
raise
a
different
question
in
my
mind.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
can't
quite
read
it
that
way.
