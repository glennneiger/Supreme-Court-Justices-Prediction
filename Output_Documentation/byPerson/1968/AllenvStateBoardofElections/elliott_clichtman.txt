mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
yes,
justice
--
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
may
it
please
the
court.
in
november
1963,
five
white
persons
were
elected
members
of
the
boards
of
supervisors,
the
principal
governing
officials
in
adams
and
forrest
counties,
mississippi,
the
counties
involved
in
fairley
versus
patterson,
number
25.
at
that
time,
negros
were
almost
totally
disenfranchised
in
mississippi.
in
august
of
1965,
the
voting
rights
act
was
passed
and,
by
june
1966,
it
was
estimated
that
132,000
negros
were
registered
to
vote
in
mississippi.
about
the
same
time,
the
mississippi
legislature
amended
section
2870
of
the
code
and
presented
those
five
supervisors
--
those
five
white
supervisors
in
adams
and
forrest
counties
with
a
vehicle
or
device
to
continue
themselves
in
office,
that
is,
the
legislature
gave
those
supervisors
the
option
or
the
power
to
adopt
an
order
switching
from
a
district-by-district
election
system
to
an
at
large
system
in
the
county.
therefore,
in
adams
county
where
census
figures
show
that
negros
have
a
majority
in
beats
2
and
4,
in
fact,
a
2-1
majority
in
beat
4,
and
where
census
figure
shows
that
whites
have
a
countywide
majority,
the
supervisors
who
were
elected
in
november
of
1963
were
given
a
vehicle
by
which
they
could
stay
in
power.
and,
in
forrest
county,
the
other
county
involved
in
fairley
versus
patterson,
where
beat
3
was
closely
divided
in
1960
and
where
negros
now
claims
a
slight
voting
majority
and
where
whites
have
a
heavy
countywide
voting
majority,
the
supervisors
who
were
elected
in
1963
also
chose
in
1966
an
at
large
system.
a
close
look
at
this
statute,
section
2870
as
amended
in
1966,
shows
that
a
simple
majority
of
the
supervisors,
three
out
of
five,
may
order
an
at
large
election
where
it
serves
their
interest.
in
other
words,
suppose
a
negro
were
elected
supervisor
in
one
of
those
two
counties.
for
the
next
election,
the
remaining
supervisors,
those
remaining
supervisors
could
adopt
a
countywide
at
large
system
and
ensure
the
defeat
of
that
negro
supervisor
elected
prior
to
the
at
large
system.
to
be
sure,
the
statute,
if
you
look
carefully
at
it,
contains
a
referendum
pet
--
provision,
but
it's
hardly
a
safeguard
here,
where
we
can
expect
the
countywide
white
majority
in
that
referendum
to
ratify
the
decision
of
the
supervisors
to
go
at
large.
mississippi
answers
"look
how
malapportioned
we
were.
our
population
--
our
districts
were
very
uneven
in
population
terms,
and
we're
only
complying
with
the
one
man-one
vote
mandate
of
the
united
states
constitution."
first
of
all,
as
justice
harlan
indicated
earlier,
the
issue
before
this
court
is
not
the
precise
motivation
of
the
supervisors.
that
is
the
question
for
the
attorney
general
upon
submission
or
for
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia.
the
question
for
this
court
is,
given
the
real
possibility
that
this
amendment
to
section
2870
is
a
vehicle
or
a
device
to
perpetuate
the
disenfranchisement
of
negros,
does
section
5
in
its
broad
sweep
cover
the
new
law?
appellants
in
number
25
submit
that
this
is
exactly
what
congress
intended.that
congress
intended,
once
and
for
all,
to
make
the
fifteenth
amendment
effective
but,
to
do
so,
congress
concluded
that
any
new
statute
relating
to
the
effectiveness
of
the
right
to
vote,
that
any
new
statute
such
as
this,
must
be
scrutinized
by
the
attorney
general
before
it
becomes
operative.
in
number
26,
the
second
case,
about
which
i
shall
speak,
the
bunton
case,
we
are
dealing
with
a
1966
amendment
for
which
mississippi
has
offered
no
explanation.
the
old
law
was
simply
that
old
--
that
all
county
superintendents
of
education,
surely
the
most
important
single
educational
official
in
the
count,
the
person
in
charge
with
carrying
out
the
mandate
of
this
court
and
of
the
constitution
to
integrate
schools,
the
old
law
was
that
this
official,
the
county
superintendent
of
education,
was
elected
unless
20%
of
the
voters
petitioned
for
an
election
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
to
make
it
appointed.
suddenly,
10
months
after
the
passage
of
the
voting
rights
act,
in
august
of
1965,
11
of
mississippi's
82
counties
were,
in
effect,
told
"your
county
board
of
education
shall
appoint
your
superintendent
of
education,"
and
the
record
shows
that
9
of
those
11
counties
have
negro
majorities.
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
our
position,
justice
harlan
--
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
our
position,
justice
harlan,
would
be
that
that,
too,
should
be
submitted
to
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states.
i
think
the
chances
are
excellent
that
if
mississippi
had
complied
with
section
5
and
had
submitted
that
law,
the
attorney
general
would
not
have
objected
within
60
days
and
the
law
would've
gone
into
effect.
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
the
counties,
i
believe,
are
spread
throughout
the
state,
but
negros
only
constitute
43%
of
the
population
of
all
of
mississippi
and
the
c
--
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
i
think
they
do
not,
chief
justice
warren.
i
think
the
--
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
the
only
common
element
is
that
negros
happen
to
be
in
the
majority
in
9
of
11
of
the
counties.
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
they
are
in
the
majority
in
a
few
others.
they
have
43%
of
the
population
in
the
total
state.
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
well,
our
point,
mr.
justice
white,
is
that
this
statute
withdrew
the
right
to
vote
from
the
electors
of
those
counties.
our
position
is
that,
given
the
rather
strong
possibility
that
there
might
have
been
a
discriminatory
motive,
this
is
just
the
kind
of
case
congress
wanted
--
just
the
kind
of
statute
congress
wanted
submitted
to
the
attorney
general
for
his
scrutiny.
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
i
think
that's
correct,
but
i
think
the
particular
facts
are
illustrative
of
what
mississippi
is
trying
to
do.
but,
technically,even
if
the
counties
were
split
evenly,
black
and
white,
the
new
law
would
still
have
to
be
submitted
to
the
attorney
general.
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
i
was
answering,
i
thought,
his
hypothetical
question
which
referred
to
a
statewide
statute.
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
well,
in
this
case
--
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
in
this
case,
i
would
prefer
to
allow
the
assistant
attorney
general
to
answer
the
question.
my
guess
is
that
he
will
want
to
scrutinize
this
very
carefully.
i
don't
know
what
position
he
will
take
on,
but
the
point
is
mississippi
had
--
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
oh,
absolutely
not.
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
i
think
that's
correct.
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
i
think
that's
correct,
justice
stewart.
our
point
in
going
into
the
facts
at
all
is
that
we
know
why
congress
passed
the
statute.
the
language
of
section
5
is
very
broad.
we're
really
trying
to
show
that
this
is
the
kind
of
thing
congress
had
in
mind,
but
i
agree
with
you
that
the
statute
could
be
very
enlightened
and,
nevertheless,
attorney
gen
--
the
state
of
mississippi,
one
of
those
half-a-dozen
states
or
so
covered
by
the
act,
would
have
to
submit
it
to
the
attorney
general.
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
that's
correct,
justice
white.
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
i
think
our
position
would
be
the
same,
mr.
justice
black,
i
think
the
attorney
general,
however,
is
particularly
equipped
since
he
has
a
civil
rights
division
to
make
this
type
of
inquiry,
but
our
position
would
be
the
same
if
the
statute
had
been
so-written.
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
of
course,
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia,
if
the
attorney
general
objects,
will
then
make
the
judgment
as
to
whether
or
not
the
declaratory
judgment
should
issue
and
whether
or
not
the
new
law
should
go
into
effect
and,
of
course,
mississippi
could
appeal
from
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia
up
to
this
court.
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
well,
justice
black,
i
would
agree
that
the
point
here
is
that
someone
is
scrutinizing
these
statutes
before
they
go
into
effect
and
it's
--
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
i
think
so,
your
honor.
as
i
stated,
mississippi
has
offered
--
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
excuse
me.
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
congress,
in
its
wisdom,
could
do
that,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
i
believe.
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
justice
white
asked
mr.
derfner
earlier
about
reapportionment,
and
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to
that
for
a
few
moments.
appellants
in
fairley
make
no
attempt
to
distinguish
our
case
or
to
distinguish
section
5
from
reapportionment
cases.
our
position
is
that
section
5
was
intended
to
cover
any
new
statute
which
relates
to
the
effectiveness
of
the
right
to
vote.
section
5
was
drafted
because
of
the
constant
attempts
by
the
state,
by
the
southern
states
to
"out-guest"
the
federal
courts,
the
justice
department,
and
the
congress.
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
well,
we
are
reading
--
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
we're
reading
essentially,
justice
harlan,
section
14
which
defines
voting
with
section
5.
section
14
defines
voting
as
all
action
necessary
to
make
a
vote
effective
in
an
election.
we're
reading
that
language
into
5
to
justify
our
broad
reading.
voting
cases
prior
to
the
passage
of
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965
were
very
difficult
to
prove.
they
were
monumental
to
try
and,
let's
face
it,
the
old
laws
were
not
working.
negros
were
not
getting
enfranchised
in
the
southern
states.
a
reapportionment
case
is
precisely
the
same
kind
of
case.
it's
difficult
to
prove
and
it's
monumental
to
try.
moreover,
because
the
state
can
justify
its
new
law
as
an
attempt
to
comply
with
the
one
man-one
vote
mandate
of
the
constitution.
there
is
the
constant
danger
that
this
justification
will
be
only
a
foci,
but
the
real
purpose
will
be
a
discriminatory
purpose
and,
therefore,
there's
a
special
need
to
scrutinize
those
statutes
which
appear
to
be
reapportionment
plans.
now,
i'm
sure
this
court
would
be
concerned
about
any
potentially
disruptive
or
burdensome
effect
on
reapportionment
plans,
but
we
don't
think
there
will
be
any.
the
local
district
court
and
the
legislature
will
create
the
reapportionment
plan
just
as
before.
there
will
be
no
change.
the
only
change
is
that
in
those
states
that
are
covered
by
the
act,
before
the
plan
goes
into
effect,
it
must
be
submitted
to
the
attorney
general.
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
that
is
our
position,
mr.
justice
brennan.
i
think
mr.
pollak,
the
assistant
attorney
general,
will
relate
to
you
that
south
carolina,
among
others
--
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
well
--
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
i
think
the
statute
can
be
read
not
to
cover
those
types
of
reapportionment
plans.
i
don't
think
this
court
need
reach
that
question.
i
think
the
question
in
this
case
is
merely
a
statute
passed
by
the
legislature.
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
well,
if
i
had
to
reach
that
question,
my
position
would
be
that
before
the
state
makes
that
new
plan
effective,
it
would
have
to
clear
it
with
the
attorney
general,
but
i
think
this
court
can
avoid
reaching
that
question.
that's
not
presented
in
this
case.
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
exactly.
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
right.
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
that's
presented
by
this
--
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
i
think
that's
presented
by
the
fairley
case.
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
yes,
that's
correct.
now,
i
think
mr.
pollek
will
say
or
--
that
south
carolina
and
other
states
have
submitted
reapportionment
plans
and
that
none
have
been
objected
to
so
far.
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
i
would
phrase
it
this
way,
mr.
justice
white,
if
--
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
no,
i
think
the
local
district
court
in
mississippi
will
play
the
same
role
that
it
played
before.
it
will
work
out
the
plan
if
the
legislature
is
unable
to.
before
the
new
plan
goes
into
effect,
it
must
be
submitted
to
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states.
he
then
has
succeeded
into
--
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
or
the
district
court,
right.
if
the
attorney
general
objects,
only
in
that
case
--
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
does
the
question
go
before
the
district
court
of
the
district
of
columbia.
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
with
approval,
your
honor,
by
the
attorney
general?
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
excuse
me.
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
before
--
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
except,
your
honor,
the
--
i
just
can't
conceive,
in
a
situation
like
that,
of
the
attorney
general
objecting.
everyone
has
scrutinized
the
plan
for
both
fifteenth
amendment
violations,
as
well
as
fourteenth
amendment
violations.
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
i
think
that's
right,
mr.
justice
fortas,
and
--
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
certainly
not.
i'm
addressing
myself
to
this
issue
only
because
appellees
in
fairley
claim
that
that's
why
they
did
it.
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
but,
that's
actually
not
the
question.
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
i
think
the
legislative
history
is
silent
on
the
point
and
mississippi
has
--
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
has
--
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
right.
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
all
coun
--
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
all
counties
are
divided
into
districts,
yes.
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
well,
the
statute
created
the
option
for
all
of
the
counties
to
do
this.
to
my
knowledge,
only
a
half-dozen
or
so
have
done
it.
two
of
those
are
involved
in
this
case.
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
that
there
--
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
well,
they
suggest
that,
in
june
of
1966
when
they
did
this,
that
that
was
their
motivation,
and
that's
why
i'm
addressing
myself
to
these
issues,
but
they
have
injected
the
reapportionment
question
into
the
case
and
i
feel
that
it
may
trouble
the
court
and,
for
that
reason,
i'm
addressing
myself
to
it.
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
mr.
justice
black,
our
relief
is
based
on
several
cases,
principles
brought
forth
in
several
cases.
we
ask
that
this
court
order
mississippi
to
comply
with
section
5.
that
this
court
--
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
that's
correct.
now,
we
could
also
ask
--
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
well,
the
question
arises
should
they
set
aside
the
old
elections
and
should
they
have
new
elections.
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
in
november
of
1967,
in
the
two
counties
that
are
affected
in
fairley,
they
held
at
large
elections.
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
now
--
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
well,
mr.
justice
black,
if
the
attorney
general
does
not
object
within
60
days,
i
think
that's
the
end
of
the
matter.
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
if
he
does
object
within
60
days,
he
will
have
good
reasons
for
doing
so,
i
am
sure,
and
i
think
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia
in
that
case
ought
to
scrutinize
it
and
i
think
new
elections
ought
to
be
held
as
soon
as
the
attorney
general
objects.
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
well,
you
do
get
--
if
we
wait
that
long,
we'll
get
into
the
1971
election.
for
that
reason
--
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
for
that
reason,
our
position
is
that,
number
one,
this
court
should
order
mississippi
to
comply
with
section
5,
i.e.,
s
--
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
well,
the
--
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
the
court
has
two
alternatives,
mr.
justice
black,
in
my
view.
if
they
--
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
but
he
can
render
a
final
judgment
that
the
state
law
is
okay,
and
that's
why
--
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
in
that
event,
no,
it's
not
filed.
in
that
event,
mississippi
has
two
alternatives.
they
can
cease
operating
the
new
law
or
they
can
go
to
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia
to
seek
to
have
a
new
law
approved.
now,
if
the
--
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
that's
correct,
in
effect.
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
as
--
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
as
not
having
a
discriminatory
purpose,
which
would
be
that
it
would
be
constitutional.
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
right.
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
certainly.
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
certainly.
he
--
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
well,
he
could
take
action
under
the
voting
rights
act
and
he
could
also
take
action
under
the
fifteenth
amendment
i
thought
your
question
was
addressed
to
the
voting
rights
act.
under
12
(d),
he
could
compel
mississippi
to
submit
the
law
to
him.
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
the
magic
is
that
he
has
an
opportunity
to
object,
and
if
he
does
object,
the
burden
--
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
right.
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
alright.
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
well,
the
difference
of
course
is
that
the
burden
is
on
mississippi
when
it
goes
before
this
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia.
mississippi
must
prove
that
its
purpose
was
not
discriminatory
and
its
effect
was
not
discriminatory.
that's
very
different.
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
well,
that's
step
one.
if
the
attorney
general
does
not
object,
as
far
as
we're
concerned,
it's
harmless
error.
if
the
attorney
general
does
object,
then
we
submit
this
is
--
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
well,
we
still
have
the
problem
--
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
but
we
still
have
the
problem,
mr.
justice
marshall,
of
what
happens
to
those
people
who
were
injured
back
in
november
of
1967.
they
should
have
had
elections
by
the
--
in
forrest
and
adams
county.
they
should
have
had
elections
for
the
position
of
county
superintendent
of
education.
what
happens
to
those
people?
our
position
is
--
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
that's
right.
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
that's
right.
we
could
--
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
alright,
logically,
we
--
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
of
course
not,
but
our
position
is
that
the
law
was
not
in
effect.
it
should
not
have
gone
into
effect
in
november
of
1967.
it
will
be
quite
--
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
well,
we
could
ask
you
to
do
that,
but
we
think
that's
unrealistic
because
it
would
take
more
than
60
days
to
hold
a
new
election.
and,
during
that
period
of
time,
mississippi
could
submit
to
the
attorney
general.
so,
we're
not
asking
you
to
immediately
set
this
aside
because
we
think
that's
unrealistic.
we
think
that
you
should
order
them
to
submit.
if
they
submit
and
the
attorney
general
objects,
then
new
elections
must
be
held.
if
the
attorney
general
does
not
object,
then
that's
the
end
of
the
matter.
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
that's
correct.
the
--
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
well,
this
court,
in
south
carolina
versus
katzenbach,
interpreted
section
5
as
meaning
that
when
a
new
law
goes
into
effect,
it
is
automatically
suspended.
it
does
not
go
into
effect.
mississippi
should
not
have
had
elections
in
november
1967
under
these
new
laws
because
it
failed
to
clear
these
new
laws.
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
that'
right.
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
mr.
justice
black,
congress
was
faced
with
an
extraordinary
problem.
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
and,
that's
what
it
did.
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
well,
the
issue,
of
course,
was
raised
in
south
carolina
versus
katzenbach
and
the
majority
of
this
court
held
that
section
5
was
constitutional,
that
section
5
immediately
suspended
the
new
law
and
that,
until
the
covered
state
clears
the
new
law,
the
law
cannot
go
into
effect.
but,
now,
we
are
in
196
--
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
well
--
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
the
appropriate
remedy,
mr.
justice
black,
in
our
view,
would
be
to
immediately
undo
what
was
done
incorrectly
in
november
1967,
and
we
should
ask
you
to
set
--
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
set
--
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
set
this
aside,
but
--
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
i
would
phrase
it
this
way,
justice
black.
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
that's
the
effect,
but
congress
said
the
new
law
was
bad.
and,
the
attorney
general
merely
has
the
power
--
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
that's
right.
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
that's
correct,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
well
--
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
mr.
justice
brennan,
that
is
correct.
all
i
have
done
this
morning
is
to
suggest
that
it's
unrealistic
for
us
to
expect
you
to
order
a
new
election
in
60
days
when
they
may
submit
but,
logically,
your
position
is
correct
and
i'm
very
happy
to
take
that
position.
the
november
1967
elections
were
not
properly
held
because
the
new
law
was
not
properly
clear.
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
therefore
--
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
well,
the
old
law,
presumably,
would
still
be
in
effect.
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
right.
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
right.
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
right.
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
that's
right.
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
right,
and
the
old
law
was
in
effect.
therefore,
this
court
could
order
mississippi
to
hold
elections
pursuant
to
the
old
law.
and,
we
would
be
delighted
if
you
would
order
that.
i
think
i
will
save,
if
your
honors
permit
me
to,
the
remaining
few
minutes
for
rebuttal.
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
yes,
justice
--
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
may
it
please
the
court.
in
november
1963,
five
white
persons
were
elected
members
of
the
boards
of
supervisors,
the
principal
governing
officials
in
adams
and
forrest
counties,
mississippi,
the
counties
involved
in
fairley
versus
patterson,
number
25.
at
that
time,
negros
were
almost
totally
disenfranchised
in
mississippi.
in
august
of
1965,
the
voting
rights
act
was
passed
and,
by
june
1966,
it
was
estimated
that
132,000
negros
were
registered
to
vote
in
mississippi.
about
the
same
time,
the
mississippi
legislature
amended
section
2870
of
the
code
and
presented
those
five
supervisors
--
those
five
white
supervisors
in
adams
and
forrest
counties
with
a
vehicle
or
device
to
continue
themselves
in
office,
that
is,
the
legislature
gave
those
supervisors
the
option
or
the
power
to
adopt
an
order
switching
from
a
district-by-district
election
system
to
an
at
large
system
in
the
county.
therefore,
in
adams
county
where
census
figures
show
that
negros
have
a
majority
in
beats
2
and
4,
in
fact,
a
2-1
majority
in
beat
4,
and
where
census
figure
shows
that
whites
have
a
countywide
majority,
the
supervisors
who
were
elected
in
november
of
1963
were
given
a
vehicle
by
which
they
could
stay
in
power.
and,
in
forrest
county,
the
other
county
involved
in
fairley
versus
patterson,
where
beat
3
was
closely
divided
in
1960
and
where
negros
now
claims
a
slight
voting
majority
and
where
whites
have
a
heavy
countywide
voting
majority,
the
supervisors
who
were
elected
in
1963
also
chose
in
1966
an
at
large
system.
a
close
look
at
this
statute,
section
2870
as
amended
in
1966,
shows
that
a
simple
majority
of
the
supervisors,
three
out
of
five,
may
order
an
at
large
election
where
it
serves
their
interest.
in
other
words,
suppose
a
negro
were
elected
supervisor
in
one
of
those
two
counties.
for
the
next
election,
the
remaining
supervisors,
those
remaining
supervisors
could
adopt
a
countywide
at
large
system
and
ensure
the
defeat
of
that
negro
supervisor
elected
prior
to
the
at
large
system.
to
be
sure,
the
statute,
if
you
look
carefully
at
it,
contains
a
referendum
pet
--
provision,
but
it's
hardly
a
safeguard
here,
where
we
can
expect
the
countywide
white
majority
in
that
referendum
to
ratify
the
decision
of
the
supervisors
to
go
at
large.
mississippi
answers
"look
how
malapportioned
we
were.
our
population
--
our
districts
were
very
uneven
in
population
terms,
and
we're
only
complying
with
the
one
man-one
vote
mandate
of
the
united
states
constitution."
first
of
all,
as
justice
harlan
indicated
earlier,
the
issue
before
this
court
is
not
the
precise
motivation
of
the
supervisors.
that
is
the
question
for
the
attorney
general
upon
submission
or
for
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia.
the
question
for
this
court
is,
given
the
real
possibility
that
this
amendment
to
section
2870
is
a
vehicle
or
a
device
to
perpetuate
the
disenfranchisement
of
negros,
does
section
5
in
its
broad
sweep
cover
the
new
law?
appellants
in
number
25
submit
that
this
is
exactly
what
congress
intended.that
congress
intended,
once
and
for
all,
to
make
the
fifteenth
amendment
effective
but,
to
do
so,
congress
concluded
that
any
new
statute
relating
to
the
effectiveness
of
the
right
to
vote,
that
any
new
statute
such
as
this,
must
be
scrutinized
by
the
attorney
general
before
it
becomes
operative.
in
number
26,
the
second
case,
about
which
i
shall
speak,
the
bunton
case,
we
are
dealing
with
a
1966
amendment
for
which
mississippi
has
offered
no
explanation.
the
old
law
was
simply
that
old
--
that
all
county
superintendents
of
education,
surely
the
most
important
single
educational
official
in
the
count,
the
person
in
charge
with
carrying
out
the
mandate
of
this
court
and
of
the
constitution
to
integrate
schools,
the
old
law
was
that
this
official,
the
county
superintendent
of
education,
was
elected
unless
20%
of
the
voters
petitioned
for
an
election
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
to
make
it
appointed.
suddenly,
10
months
after
the
passage
of
the
voting
rights
act,
in
august
of
1965,
11
of
mississippi's
82
counties
were,
in
effect,
told
"your
county
board
of
education
shall
appoint
your
superintendent
of
education,"
and
the
record
shows
that
9
of
those
11
counties
have
negro
majorities.
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
our
position,
justice
harlan
--
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
our
position,
justice
harlan,
would
be
that
that,
too,
should
be
submitted
to
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states.
i
think
the
chances
are
excellent
that
if
mississippi
had
complied
with
section
5
and
had
submitted
that
law,
the
attorney
general
would
not
have
objected
within
60
days
and
the
law
would've
gone
into
effect.
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
the
counties,
i
believe,
are
spread
throughout
the
state,
but
negros
only
constitute
43%
of
the
population
of
all
of
mississippi
and
the
c
--
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
i
think
they
do
not,
chief
justice
warren.
i
think
the
--
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
the
only
common
element
is
that
negros
happen
to
be
in
the
majority
in
9
of
11
of
the
counties.
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
they
are
in
the
majority
in
a
few
others.
they
have
43%
of
the
population
in
the
total
state.
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
well,
our
point,
mr.
justice
white,
is
that
this
statute
withdrew
the
right
to
vote
from
the
electors
of
those
counties.
our
position
is
that,
given
the
rather
strong
possibility
that
there
might
have
been
a
discriminatory
motive,
this
is
just
the
kind
of
case
congress
wanted
--
just
the
kind
of
statute
congress
wanted
submitted
to
the
attorney
general
for
his
scrutiny.
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
i
think
that's
correct,
but
i
think
the
particular
facts
are
illustrative
of
what
mississippi
is
trying
to
do.
but,
technically,even
if
the
counties
were
split
evenly,
black
and
white,
the
new
law
would
still
have
to
be
submitted
to
the
attorney
general.
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
i
was
answering,
i
thought,
his
hypothetical
question
which
referred
to
a
statewide
statute.
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
well,
in
this
case
--
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
in
this
case,
i
would
prefer
to
allow
the
assistant
attorney
general
to
answer
the
question.
my
guess
is
that
he
will
want
to
scrutinize
this
very
carefully.
i
don't
know
what
position
he
will
take
on,
but
the
point
is
mississippi
had
--
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
oh,
absolutely
not.
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
i
think
that's
correct.
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
i
think
that's
correct,
justice
stewart.
our
point
in
going
into
the
facts
at
all
is
that
we
know
why
congress
passed
the
statute.
the
language
of
section
5
is
very
broad.
we're
really
trying
to
show
that
this
is
the
kind
of
thing
congress
had
in
mind,
but
i
agree
with
you
that
the
statute
could
be
very
enlightened
and,
nevertheless,
attorney
gen
--
the
state
of
mississippi,
one
of
those
half-a-dozen
states
or
so
covered
by
the
act,
would
have
to
submit
it
to
the
attorney
general.
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
that's
correct,
justice
white.
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
i
think
our
position
would
be
the
same,
mr.
justice
black,
i
think
the
attorney
general,
however,
is
particularly
equipped
since
he
has
a
civil
rights
division
to
make
this
type
of
inquiry,
but
our
position
would
be
the
same
if
the
statute
had
been
so-written.
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
of
course,
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia,
if
the
attorney
general
objects,
will
then
make
the
judgment
as
to
whether
or
not
the
declaratory
judgment
should
issue
and
whether
or
not
the
new
law
should
go
into
effect
and,
of
course,
mississippi
could
appeal
from
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia
up
to
this
court.
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
well,
justice
black,
i
would
agree
that
the
point
here
is
that
someone
is
scrutinizing
these
statutes
before
they
go
into
effect
and
it's
--
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
i
think
so,
your
honor.
as
i
stated,
mississippi
has
offered
--
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
excuse
me.
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
congress,
in
its
wisdom,
could
do
that,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
i
believe.
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
justice
white
asked
mr.
derfner
earlier
about
reapportionment,
and
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to
that
for
a
few
moments.
appellants
in
fairley
make
no
attempt
to
distinguish
our
case
or
to
distinguish
section
5
from
reapportionment
cases.
our
position
is
that
section
5
was
intended
to
cover
any
new
statute
which
relates
to
the
effectiveness
of
the
right
to
vote.
section
5
was
drafted
because
of
the
constant
attempts
by
the
state,
by
the
southern
states
to
"out-guest"
the
federal
courts,
the
justice
department,
and
the
congress.
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
well,
we
are
reading
--
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
we're
reading
essentially,
justice
harlan,
section
14
which
defines
voting
with
section
5.
section
14
defines
voting
as
all
action
necessary
to
make
a
vote
effective
in
an
election.
we're
reading
that
language
into
5
to
justify
our
broad
reading.
voting
cases
prior
to
the
passage
of
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965
were
very
difficult
to
prove.
they
were
monumental
to
try
and,
let's
face
it,
the
old
laws
were
not
working.
negros
were
not
getting
enfranchised
in
the
southern
states.
a
reapportionment
case
is
precisely
the
same
kind
of
case.
it's
difficult
to
prove
and
it's
monumental
to
try.
moreover,
because
the
state
can
justify
its
new
law
as
an
attempt
to
comply
with
the
one
man-one
vote
mandate
of
the
constitution.
there
is
the
constant
danger
that
this
justification
will
be
only
a
foci,
but
the
real
purpose
will
be
a
discriminatory
purpose
and,
therefore,
there's
a
special
need
to
scrutinize
those
statutes
which
appear
to
be
reapportionment
plans.
now,
i'm
sure
this
court
would
be
concerned
about
any
potentially
disruptive
or
burdensome
effect
on
reapportionment
plans,
but
we
don't
think
there
will
be
any.
the
local
district
court
and
the
legislature
will
create
the
reapportionment
plan
just
as
before.
there
will
be
no
change.
the
only
change
is
that
in
those
states
that
are
covered
by
the
act,
before
the
plan
goes
into
effect,
it
must
be
submitted
to
the
attorney
general.
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
that
is
our
position,
mr.
justice
brennan.
i
think
mr.
pollak,
the
assistant
attorney
general,
will
relate
to
you
that
south
carolina,
among
others
--
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
well
--
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
i
think
the
statute
can
be
read
not
to
cover
those
types
of
reapportionment
plans.
i
don't
think
this
court
need
reach
that
question.
i
think
the
question
in
this
case
is
merely
a
statute
passed
by
the
legislature.
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
well,
if
i
had
to
reach
that
question,
my
position
would
be
that
before
the
state
makes
that
new
plan
effective,
it
would
have
to
clear
it
with
the
attorney
general,
but
i
think
this
court
can
avoid
reaching
that
question.
that's
not
presented
in
this
case.
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
exactly.
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
right.
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
that's
presented
by
this
--
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
i
think
that's
presented
by
the
fairley
case.
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
yes,
that's
correct.
now,
i
think
mr.
pollek
will
say
or
--
that
south
carolina
and
other
states
have
submitted
reapportionment
plans
and
that
none
have
been
objected
to
so
far.
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
i
would
phrase
it
this
way,
mr.
justice
white,
if
--
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
no,
i
think
the
local
district
court
in
mississippi
will
play
the
same
role
that
it
played
before.
it
will
work
out
the
plan
if
the
legislature
is
unable
to.
before
the
new
plan
goes
into
effect,
it
must
be
submitted
to
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states.
he
then
has
succeeded
into
--
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
or
the
district
court,
right.
if
the
attorney
general
objects,
only
in
that
case
--
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
does
the
question
go
before
the
district
court
of
the
district
of
columbia.
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
with
approval,
your
honor,
by
the
attorney
general?
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
excuse
me.
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
before
--
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
except,
your
honor,
the
--
i
just
can't
conceive,
in
a
situation
like
that,
of
the
attorney
general
objecting.
everyone
has
scrutinized
the
plan
for
both
fifteenth
amendment
violations,
as
well
as
fourteenth
amendment
violations.
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
i
think
that's
right,
mr.
justice
fortas,
and
--
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
certainly
not.
i'm
addressing
myself
to
this
issue
only
because
appellees
in
fairley
claim
that
that's
why
they
did
it.
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
but,
that's
actually
not
the
question.
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
i
think
the
legislative
history
is
silent
on
the
point
and
mississippi
has
--
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
has
--
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
right.
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
all
coun
--
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
all
counties
are
divided
into
districts,
yes.
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
well,
the
statute
created
the
option
for
all
of
the
counties
to
do
this.
to
my
knowledge,
only
a
half-dozen
or
so
have
done
it.
two
of
those
are
involved
in
this
case.
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
that
there
--
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
well,
they
suggest
that,
in
june
of
1966
when
they
did
this,
that
that
was
their
motivation,
and
that's
why
i'm
addressing
myself
to
these
issues,
but
they
have
injected
the
reapportionment
question
into
the
case
and
i
feel
that
it
may
trouble
the
court
and,
for
that
reason,
i'm
addressing
myself
to
it.
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
mr.
justice
black,
our
relief
is
based
on
several
cases,
principles
brought
forth
in
several
cases.
we
ask
that
this
court
order
mississippi
to
comply
with
section
5.
that
this
court
--
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
that's
correct.
now,
we
could
also
ask
--
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
well,
the
question
arises
should
they
set
aside
the
old
elections
and
should
they
have
new
elections.
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
in
november
of
1967,
in
the
two
counties
that
are
affected
in
fairley,
they
held
at
large
elections.
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
now
--
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
well,
mr.
justice
black,
if
the
attorney
general
does
not
object
within
60
days,
i
think
that's
the
end
of
the
matter.
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
if
he
does
object
within
60
days,
he
will
have
good
reasons
for
doing
so,
i
am
sure,
and
i
think
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia
in
that
case
ought
to
scrutinize
it
and
i
think
new
elections
ought
to
be
held
as
soon
as
the
attorney
general
objects.
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
well,
you
do
get
--
if
we
wait
that
long,
we'll
get
into
the
1971
election.
for
that
reason
--
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
for
that
reason,
our
position
is
that,
number
one,
this
court
should
order
mississippi
to
comply
with
section
5,
i.e.,
s
--
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
well,
the
--
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
the
court
has
two
alternatives,
mr.
justice
black,
in
my
view.
if
they
--
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
but
he
can
render
a
final
judgment
that
the
state
law
is
okay,
and
that's
why
--
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
in
that
event,
no,
it's
not
filed.
in
that
event,
mississippi
has
two
alternatives.
they
can
cease
operating
the
new
law
or
they
can
go
to
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia
to
seek
to
have
a
new
law
approved.
now,
if
the
--
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
that's
correct,
in
effect.
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
as
--
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
as
not
having
a
discriminatory
purpose,
which
would
be
that
it
would
be
constitutional.
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
right.
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
certainly.
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
certainly.
he
--
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
well,
he
could
take
action
under
the
voting
rights
act
and
he
could
also
take
action
under
the
fifteenth
amendment
i
thought
your
question
was
addressed
to
the
voting
rights
act.
under
12
(d),
he
could
compel
mississippi
to
submit
the
law
to
him.
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
the
magic
is
that
he
has
an
opportunity
to
object,
and
if
he
does
object,
the
burden
--
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
right.
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
alright.
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
well,
the
difference
of
course
is
that
the
burden
is
on
mississippi
when
it
goes
before
this
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia.
mississippi
must
prove
that
its
purpose
was
not
discriminatory
and
its
effect
was
not
discriminatory.
that's
very
different.
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
well,
that's
step
one.
if
the
attorney
general
does
not
object,
as
far
as
we're
concerned,
it's
harmless
error.
if
the
attorney
general
does
object,
then
we
submit
this
is
--
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
well,
we
still
have
the
problem
--
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
but
we
still
have
the
problem,
mr.
justice
marshall,
of
what
happens
to
those
people
who
were
injured
back
in
november
of
1967.
they
should
have
had
elections
by
the
--
in
forrest
and
adams
county.
they
should
have
had
elections
for
the
position
of
county
superintendent
of
education.
what
happens
to
those
people?
our
position
is
--
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
that's
right.
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
that's
right.
we
could
--
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
alright,
logically,
we
--
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
of
course
not,
but
our
position
is
that
the
law
was
not
in
effect.
it
should
not
have
gone
into
effect
in
november
of
1967.
it
will
be
quite
--
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
well,
we
could
ask
you
to
do
that,
but
we
think
that's
unrealistic
because
it
would
take
more
than
60
days
to
hold
a
new
election.
and,
during
that
period
of
time,
mississippi
could
submit
to
the
attorney
general.
so,
we're
not
asking
you
to
immediately
set
this
aside
because
we
think
that's
unrealistic.
we
think
that
you
should
order
them
to
submit.
if
they
submit
and
the
attorney
general
objects,
then
new
elections
must
be
held.
if
the
attorney
general
does
not
object,
then
that's
the
end
of
the
matter.
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
that's
correct.
the
--
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
well,
this
court,
in
south
carolina
versus
katzenbach,
interpreted
section
5
as
meaning
that
when
a
new
law
goes
into
effect,
it
is
automatically
suspended.
it
does
not
go
into
effect.
mississippi
should
not
have
had
elections
in
november
1967
under
these
new
laws
because
it
failed
to
clear
these
new
laws.
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
that'
right.
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
mr.
justice
black,
congress
was
faced
with
an
extraordinary
problem.
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
and,
that's
what
it
did.
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
well,
the
issue,
of
course,
was
raised
in
south
carolina
versus
katzenbach
and
the
majority
of
this
court
held
that
section
5
was
constitutional,
that
section
5
immediately
suspended
the
new
law
and
that,
until
the
covered
state
clears
the
new
law,
the
law
cannot
go
into
effect.
but,
now,
we
are
in
196
--
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
well
--
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
the
appropriate
remedy,
mr.
justice
black,
in
our
view,
would
be
to
immediately
undo
what
was
done
incorrectly
in
november
1967,
and
we
should
ask
you
to
set
--
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
set
--
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
set
this
aside,
but
--
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
i
would
phrase
it
this
way,
justice
black.
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
that's
the
effect,
but
congress
said
the
new
law
was
bad.
and,
the
attorney
general
merely
has
the
power
--
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
that's
right.
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
that's
correct,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
well
--
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
mr.
justice
brennan,
that
is
correct.
all
i
have
done
this
morning
is
to
suggest
that
it's
unrealistic
for
us
to
expect
you
to
order
a
new
election
in
60
days
when
they
may
submit
but,
logically,
your
position
is
correct
and
i'm
very
happy
to
take
that
position.
the
november
1967
elections
were
not
properly
held
because
the
new
law
was
not
properly
clear.
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
therefore
--
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
well,
the
old
law,
presumably,
would
still
be
in
effect.
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
right.
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
right.
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
right.
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
that's
right.
mr.
elliott
c.lichtman
right,
and
the
old
law
was
in
effect.
therefore,
this
court
could
order
mississippi
to
hold
elections
pursuant
to
the
old
law.
and,
we
would
be
delighted
if
you
would
order
that.
i
think
i
will
save,
if
your
honors
permit
me
to,
the
remaining
few
minutes
for
rebuttal.
