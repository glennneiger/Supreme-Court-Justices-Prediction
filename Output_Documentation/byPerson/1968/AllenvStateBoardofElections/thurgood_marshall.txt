justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
mcilwaine,
how
could
the
vote
be
secret
otherwise?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
was
just
wondering
if
the
elected
official
wrote-in
the
name
of
the
extra
person
and
then
the
guy,
the
illiterate
person,
took
it
in
the
booth.
he
could
tell
the
difference
in
handwriting
and
printing.
he
could
then
mark
the
ballot.
justice
thurgood
marshall
no
my
point
--
i
beg
your
pardon.
my
point
is
all
the
official
does
is
to
write-in
the
name
of
joe
douglas,
and
then
the
voter
takes
that
ballot
in,
by
himself
without
the
official,
and
puts
an
x,
which
he
can
do
even
in
a
form
of
a
printed
name
or
the
handwritten
name.
justice
thurgood
marshall
by
himself
without
anybody
seeing
what
he
did.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
then
we
get
to
the
point,
how
can
he
get
secrecy
of
the
ballot
and
his
right
to
vote
at
the
same
time
if
he's
illiterate?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but,
isn't
he
entitled
to
it
by
the
constitution
of
virginia?
justice
thurgood
marshall
where
is
the
requirement
for
secrecy?
i
thought
that
was
in
the
constitution?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
that's
required
of
everybody
but
the
illiterate.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
mcilwaine,
you'll
agree
that
part
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1965
was
vitally
concerned
with
illiterates?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
agree
that
the
state
--
the
commonwealth
of
virginia
did
take
action
in
the
form
of
a
memorandum
dealing
with
the
question
of
how
illiterates
may
vote
after
the
act?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
still
say
that
that
--
the
attorney
general
has
nothing
to
do
with
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes,
sir.
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
say
that
an
action
of
the
commonwealth
of
virginia,
one
of
the
states
included
under
the
act,
takes
action
subsequent
to
the
civil
rights
act
involving
the
right
to
vote
of
illiterates
or
the
method
of
permitting
illiterates
to
vote
is
not
the
type
of
action
which
should
have
been
submitted
to
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
that's
not
before
us,
is
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
not
before
us?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
mcilwaine.
justice
thurgood
marshall
has
the
question
ever
come
up
about
the
status
before
in
virginia?
you
mentioned
the
other
states
and
you've
got
in
your
brief
where
it's
come
up.
justice
thurgood
marshall
has
the
validity
ever
been
brought
up
in
virginia
at
all?
justice
thurgood
marshall
stickers.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
did
originally
relied
on
the
fifteenth
amendment
also.
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
did
you
take
it
out?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
actually
did.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
did
the
stipulation
say?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
happens
if
mississippi
passes
a
law
and
the
attorney
general
reads
it
in
the
newspaper
that
the
law
was
passed
and
he
got
the
us
attorney
in
jackson
to
get
him
a
copy
of
the
law?
could
he
take
any
action?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
could?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what's
the
magic
if
mississippi
has
to
"submit
it."
what's
the
magic
in
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
mean,
what's
the
magic
in
submitting
it,
other
than
he
gets
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
my
case
was,
he
did
have
a
copy
of
the
bill
as
it
was
passed,
certified
copy.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
gives
him
everything
he
needs
to
start
where
it
does.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
difference
does
it
make
whether
he
gets
it
from
airbab
or
he
gets
it
at
the
state
of
mississippi?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
then,
i
misunderstand
you.i
thought
you
said
the
only
relief
you
wanted
was
that
mississippi
should
submit
a
copy
of
this
bill
to
the
attorney
general.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
we
don't
get
any
of
that.
all
you
ask
us
to
do
is
to
tell
mississippi
"you
must
submit
this
to
the
attorney
general."
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
must
give
to
the
attorney
general
a
copy
of
the
law
that
he's
drawn
a
brief
on.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
then,
you're
asking
for
more
than
that
we
just
ruled
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
this
be
submitted.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
not
exactly.
what
are
you
asking?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
pollak.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
do
you
say
did
the
states
point
that
you
didn't
know
about
this
at
least
as
of
march
of
this
year,
us
attorney
--
assistant
attorney
general?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
you
did
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
allain,
the
state
of
mississippi
has
not
yet
submitted.
i
think
your
position
that's
stated
in
your
brief
is
that
this
court
submitted
it
to
the
attorney
general.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
that's
not
what
the
statute
says.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
statute
says
the
state
shall
submit
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
statute
doesn't
say
put
on
notice.
it
says
submit.
justice
thurgood
marshall
has
mississippi
done
anything
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
filed
in
march
of
this
year
to
get
in
touch
with
the
attorney
general
by
meeting
them
on
the
street
or
mail
in
or
anything
else?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
exactly
what
you
did
here.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
allain,
assuming
that
these
acts
are
covered
by
the
civil
rights
act
of
1965,
which
i
know
you
don't
agree
with,
but
assuming
that
for
a
moment,
then
is
it
your
position
that
up
until
march
of
this
year
these
particular
mississippi
statutes
were
suspended
and
then
60
days
after
march,
because
the
attorney
general
didn't
take
any
action,
they
get
new
life?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
would
be
an
anomalous
situation,
wouldn't
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
that
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
there's
nothing
that
you
showed
me
so
far
that
said
the
attorney
general
knew
about
this
before
march,
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
he
hadn't
approved
it
before
march.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
so,
then,
it
was
suspended
because
it
hadn't
been
submitted
to
him.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
you're
relying
on
the
fact
that
he
didn't
disapprove
it
within
60
days.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
all
i'm
talking
about.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
his
60
days,
according
to
your
position,
didn't
start
until
march
of
this
year.
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
year.
justice
thurgood
marshall
wasn't
that
in
march?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
has
it
--
whatever
date
that
is.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
the
--
he
had
not
passed
it
on
in
one
way
or
the
other.
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
had
not
had
an
opportunity
under
the
statute
to
pass
on
it
because
it
hadn't
been
"submitted."
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
then,
it
was
suspended.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
allain,
why
do
you
think
they
require
a
three-judge
court
from
the
district
on
the
same
act,
instead
of
having
a
one-judge?
justice
thurgood
marshall
councilman.
justice
thurgood
marshall
yeah,
i
know.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
thought
that
the
reason
was
they
didn't
want
one
single
judge
to
pass
on
life
and
death
of
a
state
statute,
one,
and,
two,
rapid
access
to
this
court
was
the
reason
for
the
three-judge
court
in
the
district
of
columbia.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
that's
--
i
think
that
congress
is
a
little
on
the
other
argument
that
when
an
individual
sues
he
has
to
have
--
one
judge
is
enough.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
see.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
mr.
allain,
what
happens
if
the
attorney
general
never
hears
of
the
act?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
does
the
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
does
the
person
who's
injured,
what
can
he
do
about
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
he
couldn't
go
to
court
about
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
so
many
was
not
unconstitutional.
it
was
just
a
violation
of
the
act.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
that
the
people
that
the
act
was
passed
to
protect
would
be
out
of
luck.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
--
couldn't
they
assume
and
couldn't
congress
assume
that
the
state
of
mississippi
would've
submitted
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
suppose
he
submits
it
to
the
attorney
general's
office
and
the
attorney
general's
office
doesn't
pay
any
attention
to
it.
now,
what
rights
does
the
citizen
have
after
60
days?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
good
is
it
to
him?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i'm
saying
this
is
a
thoroughly
uncooperative
attorney
general.
then,
the
individual
citizen
is
without
remedy.
justice
thurgood
marshall
since
you
say
that
this
is
the
remedy,
he
is
now
without
a
remedy.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
happens
if
some
court
disagrees
with
you
in
the
state
of
mississippi
as
to
whether
or
not
this
is
covered
by
the
civil
rights
act
and
the
attorney
general
does
nothing,
nobody
else
does
anything,
and
we
have
a
right,
we've
got
a
remedy
or
remedy
without
anything?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what's
the
remedy?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what's
the
remedy
that
may
enact
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
the
man
is
denied
the
right
to
vote
because
of
race,
he's
slightly
injured.
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
what
court?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
under
your
theory.
you
said
he
has
a
remedy
in
a
court.
which
court?
justice
thurgood
marshall
where
do
you
get
that
from?
justice
thurgood
marshall
section
5?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
get
that
from
section
5?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
say
that
if
these
appellants
in
this
case
had
filed
a
case
for
a
three-judge
court
for
the
district
of
columbia,
it's
alright?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
your
position?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
how
many
covered
by
this
statute?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
wells,
since
you
don't
know
and
i
don't
know
and
nobody
in
this
room
knows,
wouldn't
it
be
wise
for
somebody
to
find
out
whether
or
not
it
was
for
reason
of
race?
i'm
not
saying
it
is,
but
don't
you
think
it'd
be
worthy
of
finding
it
out?
wouldn't
mississippi
be
happier,
too?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
it's
a
c
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
mcilwaine,
how
could
the
vote
be

otherwise?
justice
thurgood

i

the
statute
doesn't
say
put
on
notice.
it
says
submit.
justice
thurgood
marshall
has
mississippi
done
anything
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
filed
in
march
of
this
year
to
get
in
touch
with
the
attorney
general
by
meeting
them
on
the
street
or
mail
in
or
anything
else?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
exactly
what
you
did
here.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
allain,
assuming
that
these
acts
are
covered
by
the
civil
rights
act
of
1965,
which
i
know
you
don't
agree
with,
but
assuming
that
for
a
moment,
then
is
it
your
position
that
up
until
march
of
this
year
these
particular
mississippi
statutes
were
suspended
and
then
60
days
after
march,
because
the
attorney
general
didn't
take
any
action,
they
get
new
life?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
would
be
an
anomalous
situation,
wouldn't
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
that
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
there's
nothing
that
you
showed
me
so
far
that
said
the
attorney
general
knew
about
this
before
march,
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
he
hadn't
approved
it
before
march.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
so,
then,
it
was
suspended
because
it
hadn't
been
submitted
to
him.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
you're
relying
on
the
fact
that
he
didn't
disapprove
it
within
60
days.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
all
i'm
talking
about.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
his
60
days,
according
to
your
position,
didn't
start
until
march
of
this
year.
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
year.
justice
thurgood
marshall
wasn't
that
in
march?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
has
it
--
whatever
date
that
is.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
the
--
he
had
not
passed
it
on
in
one
way
or
the
other.
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
had
not
had
an
opportunity
under
the
statute
to
pass
on
it
because
it
hadn't
been
"submitted."
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
then,
it
was
suspended.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
allain,
why
do
you
think
they
require
a
three-judge
court
from
the
district
on
the
same
act,
instead
of
having
a
one-judge?
justice
thurgood
marshall
councilman.
justice
thurgood
marshall
yeah,
i
know.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
thought
that
the
reason
was
they
didn't
want
one
single
judge
to
pass
on
life
and
death
of
a
state
statute,
one,
and,
two,
rapid
access
to
this
court
was
the
reason
for
the
three-judge
court
in
the
district
of
columbia.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
that's
--
i
think
that
congress
is
a
little
on
the
other
argument
that
when
an
individual
sues
he
has
to
have
--
one
judge
is
enough.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
see.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
mr.
allain,
what
happens
if
the
attorney
general
never
hears
of
the
act?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
does
the
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
does
the
person
who's
injured,
what
can
he
do
about
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
he
couldn't
go
to
court
about
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
so
many
was
not
unconstitutional.
it
was
just
a
violation
of
the
act.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
that
the
people
that
the
act
was
passed
to
protect
would
be
out
of
luck.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
--
couldn't
they
assume
and
couldn't
congress
assume
that
the
state
of
mississippi
would've
submitted
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
suppose
he
submits
it
to
the
attorney
general's
office
and
the
attorney
general's
office
doesn't
pay
any
attention
to
it.
now,
what
rights
does
the
citizen
have
after
60
days?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
good
is
it
to
him?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i'm
saying
this
is
a
thoroughly
uncooperative
attorney
general.
then,
the
individual
citizen
is
without
remedy.
justice
thurgood
marshall
since
you
say
that
this
is
the
remedy,
he
is
now
without
a
remedy.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
happens
if
some
court
disagrees
with
you
in
the
state
of
mississippi
as
to
whether
or
not
this
is
covered
by
the
civil
rights
act
and
the
attorney
general
does
nothing,
nobody
else
does
anything,
and
we
have
a
right,
we've
got
a
remedy
or
remedy
without
anything?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what's
the
remedy?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what's
the
remedy
that
may
enact
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
the
man
is
denied
the
right
to
vote
because
of
race,
he's
slightly
injured.
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
what
court?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
under
your
theory.
you
said
he
has
a
remedy
in
a
court.
which
court?
justice
thurgood
marshall
where
do
you
get
that
from?
justice
thurgood
marshall
section
5?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
get
that
from
section
5?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
say
that
if
these
appellants
in
this
case
had
filed
a
case
for
a
three-judge
court
for
the
district
of
columbia,
it's
alright?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
your
position?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
how
many
covered
by
this
statute?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
wells,
since
you
don't
know
and
i
don't
know
and
nobody
in
this
room
knows,
wouldn't
it
be
wise
for
somebody
to
find
out
whether
or
not
it
was
for
reason
of
race?
i'm
not
saying
it
is,
but
don't
you
think
it'd
be
worthy
of
finding
it
out?
wouldn't
mississippi
be
happier,
too?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
it's
a
