mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
as
counsel
for
the
various
virginia
election
officials
in
this
matter,
i
should
like
to
attempt
to
establish
at
the
outset,
that,
if
i
may,
just
what
this
case
involves
and,
perhaps,
the
best
way
to
accomplish
that
is
to
draw
the
court's
attention
to
the
opening
paragraph
of
the
opinion
of
the
court
below
which
is
on
page
67
(a)
of
the
appendix
and
which
contains
all
of
the
operative
facts,
out
of
which
this
case
arose.
in
four
brief
sentences,
the
court
below
has
stated
the
entire
case
presented
by
the
plaintiffs
in
the
trial
court.
it
was
to
the
effect,
in
sentence
one,
that
plaintiffs
are
registered
voters
who
are
unable
to
spell
accurately
or
write
legibly,
who
attempted
to
cast
a
write-in
ballot
in
the
1966
congressional
elections
in
the
fourth
district
of
virginia.
second,
each
one
attempted
to
do
this
by
pasting
on
the
official
ballot
a
sticker
in
which
the
name
of
the
write-in
candidate
had
been
printed
and
voting
for
the
name
printed
on
the
sticker.
third,
these
ballots
were
not
tabulated
in
the
official
returns
for
the
write-in
candidate.
the
fourth
sentence
begins
“upon
these
undisputed
facts,
the
plaintiffs
seek
a
declaratory
judgment
that
rights
secured
to
them
by
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965
have
been
denied.”
now,
we
submit
that
the
only
question
that
can
be
raised
by
that
set
of
facts
is
whether
or
not
the
refusal
of
the
virginia
election
officials,
pursuant
to
virginia
law,
to
count
these
votes
which
were
cast
by
means
of
labels
or
stickers
or
pasters
violated
some
right
secured
to
illiterates
in
the
fourth
district
of
virginia,
a
right
secured
by
the
fourteenth
amendment
or
by
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965.
we
know
full
well
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
does
not
secure
that
right
to
anyone
else
in
the
united
states.
the
fourteenth
amendment
per
se
does
not
even
secure
to
an
illiterate
the
right
to
vote
at
all,
much
less
to
select
the
means
by
which
he
will
vote.
and,
the
cases
are
perfectly
clear
that
the
matter
of
whether
or
not
stickers
and
pasters
shall
be
permitted
as
an
appropriate
means
of
voting
is
a
matter
to
be
determined
by
each
individual
state
and
regardless
of
whether
the
state
permits
it
or
rejects
it.
neither
determination
of
that
question
is
violative
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
the
case
in
the
seventh
circuit
and
the
case
of
morris
versus
fortson
in
the
recent
case
in
georgia,
since
the
enactment
of
the
civil
rights
act
clearly
settles
this
matter.
so,
the
assertion
of
the
plaintiffs
on
this
point
is
that,
of
all
the
people
in
the
united
states,
they
alone,
as
illiterates,
have
a
constitutional
right
to
vote
by
means
of
stickers
and
pasters.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
your
honor,
i
do
not
know
how
it
could
be
secret
otherwise,
but
i'm
not
--
but
i
am
of
the
opinion,
as
was
the
lower
court,
and
certain
that
they
are
not
entitled
to
a
secret
ballot.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
he
could
mark
the
ballot
by
the
name
of
the
individual.
well,
he
could
do
that
under
the
virginia
law.
he
is
simply
requested
to
furnish
him
assistance
and
to
ensure
that
his
ballot
is
marked
in
accordance
with
the
way
he
wants
it.
there's
no
requirement
that
he
must
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
yes.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
that
could
be
done,
if
your
honor
please.
of
course,
the
secrecy
of
his
ballot
will
be
compromised
in
any
event,
to
the
extent
that
he
carries
the
ballot
to
an
election
official
and
asks
him
to
write
joe
douglas'
name
on
it.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
well,
your
honor,
i
do
not
understand
that
he
can
and
i
do
not
understand
that
he
is
required
or
entitled
to
the
complete
secrecy
of
his
ballot
either
by
the
fourteenth
amendment
or
by
the
voting
rights
act.
as
matter
of
fact,
this
is
to
the
contrary.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
only
to
the
extent
that
the
regulations
issued
by
the
general
assembly
of
virginia,
the
statutes
pursuant
to
section
36
of
the
virginia
constitutions,
states
that
in
order
to
obtain
the
uniformity
in
election,
the
general
assembly
of
virginia
shall
enact
laws
governing
the
conduct
of
elections.
and,
virginia
has
enacted
those.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
that
is
also
in
the
constitution,
your
honor,
in
section
26.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
no,
sir,
it
would
not
apply
to
anyone
who
is
physically
handicapped
or
educationally
handicapped.
as
the
cases
made
clear,
the
secrecy
of
the
ballot
of
the
physically
handicapped
or
the
educationally
handicapped
must,
to
some
extent,
be
compromised.
there's
no
other
way
you
can
do
it.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
if
your
honor
please,
in
that
connection,
two
things.
every
state
treats
the
blind
or
a
number
of
states
treat
the
blind
differently,
and
every
state
has
different
methods
of
solving
the
problem,
what
you're
going
to
do
with
the
physically
handicapped
or
the
educationally
handicapped.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
no,
sir,
i
--
we
do
not
object
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
three-judge
court
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
with
respect
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
they
have
a
right
to
cast
that
ballot
by
means
of
stickers
or
pasters,
which
was
the
only
operative
fact
in
this
case.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
with
respect
to
those
facts,
yes.
i
mean,
i
think
in
viewing
the
complaint,
if
your
honor
please,
the
assertion
that
the
virginia
statute
as
it
then
stood
forbid
them
to
cast
ballots
by
this
method
and
the
prayer
for
relief
which
attempted
to
enjoin
it
to
the
extent
that
it
purported
to
require
the
voter
to
cast
his
write-in
vote
in
his
own
handwriting
was
sufficient
for
the
district
judge
in
scanning
that
complaint
to
think
that
the
question
was
not
entirely
frivolous
and
to
call
for
a
three-judge
court.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
that
--
with
respect
to
stickers
or
pasters
on
the
ballot,
your
honor.
in
other
words,
until
this
case
was
argued
here,
i
did
not
know
that
this
was
a
race
case.
i
don't
find
the
word
negro
in
the
complaint.
i
don't
find
it
in
the
court's
opinion.
it
is
not
--
it
is
a
simple
question
of
illiterates.
in
the
lower
court,
it
was
simply
argued
that
these
people
who
were
represented
were
functionally
illiterate
people
without
regard
to
race
or
color.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
no,
sir.
the
only
thing
in
the
voting
rights
--
the
only
argument
made
on
the
voting
rights
act
was
the
test
or
device
proposition
that,
in
requiring
the
individual
to
cast
the
ballot
in
his
own
handwriting,
that
constituted
a
test
or
device.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
and
was
suspended.
but,
that
was
admitted,
if
your
honor
please,
so
there
was
no
case
or
controversy
on
that
in
the
lower
court.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
there
still
isn't.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
it
was,
yes.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
that
is
correct.
and,
within
a
week
after
the
enactment
of
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965,
the
state
board
of
elections
and
the
attorney
general
of
virginia,
together,
issued
a
bulletin.
actually,
it
was
issued
of
course
by
the
state
board
of
elections
which
flatly
states,
which
your
honors
will
find
in
the
record,
that
the
voting
rights
act
had
superseded,
in
so
many
words,
the
virginia
statute
requiring
people
to
register
to
vote
in
their
own
handwriting,
and
directing
the
registrars
in
virginia
to
register
people
who
were
illiterate
and
couching
that
regulation
almost
verbatim
in
the
form
of
the
civil
service
regulation
issued
to
federal
examiners
to
guide
them
in
the
method
by
which
they
would
enroll
illiterate
voters
in
states
affected
by
the
act.
then,
three
weeks
before
the
election,
another
bulletin
was
issued
in
which
the
election
officials
were
instructed
to
assist
illiterate
voters
in
casting
their
ballots
and
broadening
the
provisions
of
the
virginia
statute,
which
adhered
for
limited
assistance
only
to
the
physically
handicapped,
to
include
the
illiterate.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
only
in
the
few
remaining
minutes
of
my
argument,
i
had
intended
to
touch
upon
it,
your
honor,
but
i'm
perfectly
content
to
come
to
it
now.
initially,
significant
in
respect
to
that
memorandum
is
the
fact
that
the
solicitor
general
does
not
have
one
line
in
it,
which
even
contains
a
hint
that
he
was
even
remotely
or
conceivably
supporting
the
position
stated
by
the
appellants
in
this
case.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
that
is
correct
and
we
have
framed
our
response
to
that
both
in
our
memorandum
submitted
at
the
time
and
in
our
brief
that
it
cannot
possibly
be.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
well,
of
course,
i
take
the
position,
your
honor,
that
the
issue
is
not
properly
before
you
because
it
was
not
raised
as
an
issue
in
this
case
and
was
not
passed
upon
by
the
trial
court.
and
so,
that
issue
is
one
injected
at
this,
the
ultimate
level
of
appellate
review,
by
the
solicitor
general.
of
course,
it
is
before
the
court
in
the
sense
that
the
court
invited
the
solicitor
general
to
express
his
views,
and
he
has.
and,
we
do
not
object
to
the
--
to
filing
a
response
to
it
or
to
stating
our
position.
the
only
thing
we
objected
to
is
if
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
no,
sir.
what
we
do
object
to
this,
and
on
this
we
wish
to
be
perfectly
clear,
we
do
object
to
the
solicitor
general
trying
to
turn
this
case
which
was
a
straight
case
to
involving
a
question
of
whether
or
not
a
person
could
vote
by
means
of
a
sticker
or
paster
into
a
case
in
which
a
complaint
had
been
filed
alleging
that
election
officials
had
engaged
in
discriminatory
practices
and
proposed
to
continue
in
those
practices
unless
an
injunction
was
issued
under
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965
requiring
them
to
register
illiterates
or
to
vote
or
to
otherwise
give
up
practices
which
it
obtained
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965.
none
of
those
practices
have
ever
obtained
in
virginia.
virginia
has
never
taken
the
position
that
race
as
an
irrelevance
to
a
citizen's
right
to
vote.
we
took
the
position
for
years
that
race
had
a
great
deal
to
do
with
a
right
of
a
person
to
attend
a
school
or
to
marry.
those
issues
had
been
litigated
and
decided
by
this
court,
but
virginia
has
never
taken
the
position.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
nor,
race
has
any
relation
to
that
and
we
do
not
--
we
object
most
extraneously
to
any
attempt
to
remand
this
case
to
the
district
court
to
enable
the
plaintiffs
to
make
a
new
case
of
it
at
the
district
level.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
yes.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
well,
if
it
--
of
course,
the
solicitor
general
does
make
that
assertion,
mr.
justice
fortas,
and,
of
course,
the
court
can
consider
it.
it
is
not
a
part
of
the
record
brought
up
on
this
appeal.
it
is
not
a
question
raised
by
the
jurisdictional
statement.
it
is
a
question
inserted
by
the
solicitor
general
in
this
court.
now,
envisioning
the
possibility
that
the
court
would
consider
the
argument,
we
have
stated
why
we
feel
that
it
cannot
possibly
be
correct
that
the
bulletins
issued
in
this
case
were
a
practice
or
procedure
within
the
meaning
of
section
5
(a)
and,
it
is
so
obvious
to
us
that
it
cannot
be,
that
we
do
not
see
how
there
can
be
two
sides
of
the
question.
if
it
was
a
practice
or
procedure,
it
would
mean
that
when
the
voting
rights
act
became
effective
in
virginia
on
august
the
7,
1965,
there
was
nothing
that
the
virginia
election
officials
could
do
about
it,
except
continue
to
violate
it.
this
bulletin
was
issued
within
a
week
of
the
voting
rights
act
becoming
effective
and
it
told
the
virginia
election
officials
that
the
voting
rights
act
was
then
enforced
in
virginia
and,
despite
the
provisions
of
virginia
law
which
do
not
permit
illiterates
to
register,
you
are
to
begin
to
register
them.
now,
under
the
solicitor
general's
argument,
we
couldn't
do
that
until
we
had
taken
that
regulation
and
submitted
it
to
the
attorney
general.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
now,
suppose
we
had
never
written
the
regulation.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
suppose
we
waited
ten
months
to
write
it,
what
is
suppose
to
happen
to
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965
in
virginia
in
the
interim
if
we
cannot
enforce
a
bulletin
which
says
these
instructions
implement
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965?
the
voting
rights
act
has
superseded
the
provisions
in
virginia
laws
which
forbid
illiterates
to
register
and
forbid
them
to
vote,
and
you
are
now
required
by
this
prevailing
supervening
federal
law
to
register
illiterates.
we
did
that
even
before
south
carolina
against
katzenbach
was
filed
in
this
court
and
it
prevailed,
and
illiterates
were
being
registered
in
virginia
and
were
being
voted
in
virginia
in
contravention
of
virginia
law
while
south
carolina
against
katzenbach
was
being
argued
in
this
court.
and,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
we
issued
those
bulletins
in
1965.
we
passed
through
the
general
election
of
1965
without
a
murmur.
we
continued
for
another
year.
we
have
still
had
no
difficulty
with
it,
until
the
question
of
voting
for
s.w.
tucker
by
means
of
a
sticker
or
paster
in
the
1966
congressional
elections
arose.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
yes,
sir.
one,
how
they
may
register
and,
another,
how
they
may
vote.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states?
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
i
say
that
they
are
not
a
regulation
under
section
5
(a)
which
he
is
required
to
approve
in
advance.
i
do
not
say
he
has
nothing
to
do
with
it.
the
attorney
general
has
brought
a
number
of
suits.
if
he
thinks
that
these
are
improper
regulations,
he
can
bring
a
suit
to
establish
it.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
that's
correct.
that
is
our
position,
and
we
state
that
the
propositions
under
the
facts
of
this
case
that
if
that
is
so,
then
there
were
a
number
of
the
illiterates
voted
at
the
1965
election
who
would
not
have
been
if
we
had
been
required
to
submit
that
matter
to
the
attorney
general
and
wait
for
60
days
for
him
to
express
his
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
the
whole
question
is
not
before
you,
your
honor.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
no,
sir.
i
submit
that
if
that
is
put
out,
of
course,
i
submit
that,
at
any
time
after
the
passage
of
the
voting
rights
act,
the
legislature
should
amend
its
election
laws.
they
are,
under
the
voting
rights
act,
superficially
at
least
required
to
submit
them
to
the
attorney
general
and,
as
the
attorney
gen
--
solicitor
general
admits,
a
number
of
them
are
and
they
are
permitted
to
be
enforced
even
though
they
have
not
been
officially
avowed
or
disavowed
by
the
attorney
general.
but,
i
am
submitting
to
your
honors
that
these
instructions
which
were
issued
immediately
after
the
act
became
effective,
implementing
the
act
were
not
such
instructions
as
were
required
to
be
submitted
to
solicitor
general.
the
--
otherwise,
it
would
mean
that
the
solicitor
general
was
empowered
to
suspend
the
operation
of
the
voting
rights
act
for
a
period
of
60
days
or
that
the
election
officials
were
empowered
to
do
it
simply
by
not
submitting
anything
to
the
solicitor
general
and
say,
“we're
sorry,
we
can't
help
you.
when
a
process
of
getting
together
a
regulation
for
the
registration
of
illiterates
and
the
voting
of
the
illiterates.
when
we
get
it
together,
there's
still
nothing
we
can
do.
we've
got
to
submit
it
to
the
solicitor
--
to
the
attorney
general.
after
that,
we've
got
to
wait
60
days
and,
if
election
comes
up
in
that
time
and
we
haven't
heard
from
him,
you
won't
be
able
to
vote
because
we
can't
do
it.”
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
somebody
should
have
the
authority
to
obey
the
federal
--
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965.
that's
the
way
we
viewed
it
in
virginia,
if
your
honor
please.
that's
why
we
put
out
the
regulations.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
well,
they,
so
far
as
section
5
(a)
of
course,
if
that's
kind
of
a
regulation,
it's
got
to
come
to
the
district
court
of
the
district
of
columbia.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
i
don't
understand
that
any
other
district
court
is
open
for
that
question
of
the
validity
of
a
regulation
if
it
is
enforced
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
unless
they
could,
of
course,
get
immediate
action
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
dis
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
district
of
columbia.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
yes,
sir.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
no,
i
think
it's
alternatives.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
yes,
and
of
course
the
solicitor
general
could
approve
or
he
could
wait
60
days.
the
law
reads
that
if
you
do
not
--
if
there
is
no
objection
filed
by
the
solicitor
general
or
the
attorney
general
within
60
days,
then
it
may
be
put
into
effect.
now,
there
had
been
number
of
cases,
gentlemen,
in
which
this
issue
has
been
raised
in
louisiana,
in
georgia,
in
alabama,
and
in
mississippi.
in
each
of
those
cases,
the
relief
granted
by
the
district
court
sitting
in
those
cases,
so
far
as
illiterates
are
concerned,
has
been
to
require
the
local
election
officials
to
assist
the
illiterates,
and
specific
provision
has
been
made.
none
of
those
cases
permit
anyone
other
than
an
election
official
to
assist
the
illiterate
in
casting
his
vote
even
though,
in
those
states,
the
physically
handicapped
or
the
blind
may
be
helped
by
a
member
of
their
family
or
a
person
of
their
choice.
in
the
cases
which
we
have
catalogued
in
our
brief,
united
states
against
mississippi,
morris
against
fortson,
united
states
against
executive
committee,
and
united
states
against
louisiana,
the
relief
granted
by
federal
district
courts
under
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965
is
limited
to
permitting
only
election
officials
to
aid
the
illiterate
who
had
been
enfranchised
by
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965.
specifically,
in
united
states
against
louisiana,
that
was
true,
and
the
court
added
that
nothing
contained
in
this
order
shall
affect
any
of
the
state
provision
relating
to
the
casting
of
votes
by
the
physically
handicapped
or
the
blind.
now,
at
that
time,
the
physically
handicapped
and
the
blind
were
not
permitted
to
be
aided
by
election
officials
but
could
take
a
friend
of
their
choice
if
their
blind
or,
if
they
were
otherwise
physically
handicapped,
a
member
of
their
family.
yet,
when
the
decree
was
entered
in
that
case,
assistance
to
illiterate
voters
was
limited
by
the
court
solely
to
election
officials
aiding
the
voters.
and,
that
is
true
in
each
of
the
four
cases
which
are
mentioned
in
the
solicitor
general's
memorandum
and
which
we
have
analyzed
in
our
brief.
now,
we
cannot
believe
that
the
attorney
general
of
virginia
is
required
to
outdo
judge
wisdom,
judge
christenberry,
judge
bell
or
the
judges
of
the
fifth
circuit
and
go
further
and
say,
and
what's
more
in
virginia
you
may
cast
a
vote
if
you
are
illiterate
by
means
of
a
sticker
or
paster.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
it
has
never
been
proved.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
well,
if
the
court
decides
that
that
alternative
is
the
problem,
it
would
of
course
then,
i
assume,
delay
consideration
of
the
other
questions
until
the
matter
had
been
--
and
perhaps
the
court
would
remand
it
to
the
district
court
and
with
instructions
to
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
yes,
your
honor,
but
you
would
not
delay
reaching
the
question
of
whether
or
not
virginia's
requirement
that
the
voter
vote
in
his
own
handwriting
is
constitutional
because,
of
course,
that
is
not
a
requirement
any
longer.
you
don't
reach
the
requirement
because
it
isn't
there.
nobody
is
required
to
insert
a
write-in
vote
in
his
own
handwriting
if
he
is
physically
or
educationally
handicapped.
that
is
the
very
statute
that
the
attorney
general
said
had
been
superseded
and
could
no
longer
be
enforced.
so
that,
you
will
never
reach
that
question,
unless
of
course
it
is
to
be
fabricated
because
this
case
was
one
in
which
the
plaintiffs
came
in
and
said,
in
effect,
“your
statute
requiring
a
write-in
vote
to
be
cast
in
the
voter's
handwriting
has
been
superseded.”
and,
our
response
was
“you're
quite
right,
it
has,
and
we
said
so
over
a
year
ago
in
a
bulletin.”
now
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
where
is
the
case
of
controversy?
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
the
validity
of
what?
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
stickers?
no,
sir.
except
in
the
opinion
of
the
attorney
general.
virginia
statutes
require
ballots
which
are
printed.
if
people
want
to
mark
their
ballots,
mark
them
in
a
certain
way,
that's
mandatory.
assistance
must
be
given
in
a
certain
way.
that's
the
only
provision
made
for
assistance.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
sticker
voting
is
not
permitted
not
because
there
is
a
statute
that
says
that
it's
not
permitted,
but
because
the
statute
prescribed
a
method
by
which
ballots
shall
be
marked
and
assistance
should
be
given
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
the
only
thing
that
i
think
can
possibly
be
before
your
honors
for
decision
is
whether
or
not
a
fourteenth
amendment
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
per
se
or
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965
guarantees
anyone
the
right
to
vote
by
means
of
a
sticker
or
paster
in
violation
of
the
state
law
to
the
contrary.
that's
the
only
thing
i
think
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
i
--
yes.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
yes,
sir,
because
that,
as
i
say
as
implemented
by
the
regulation,
the
illiterate
is
now
granted
the
same
right
to
assistance
as
the
physically
handicapped
and,
therefore,
you
have
to
read
the
statute
as
implemented
by
the
regulations.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
that
is
correct.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
well,
it's
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
it's
only
--
only
in
illiterates
because
that's
the
only
class
represented
here,
your
honor.
the
physically
handicapped
are
not
even
in
here,
nor
any
racial
classifications
in
here,
only
the
illiterates,
as
a
class,
is
the
only
class
that
is
here.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
only,
yes,
or
without
the
means
of
stickers
or
pasters
because
that,
you
see,
is
the
operative
factor
of
this
case.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
the
action
which
caused
this
case
to
arise,
mr.
justice
white
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
was
the
fact
that
these
votes
were
cast
in
this
manner
and
were
not
counted.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
and,
the
action
that's
challenged
here
is
whether
or
not
that
failure
of
the
election
officials
to
count
these
votes
cast
by
means
of
stickers
or
pasters
violates
some
rights
secured
to
these
plaintiffs
by
the
equal
protection
clause
or
the
voting
rights
act.
there's
nothing
suggested
that
anybody
else
is
permitted
to
vote
by
means
of
stickers
or
pasters.
they're
not.
there's
no
question
of
discrimination
here
in
that
respect
at
all.
i
would
simply
point
out
there
is
--
that
there
is
no
hesitancy
on
the
part
of
virginia
so
far
as
the
persons
who
may
render
assistance
are
concerned,
with
respect
to
the
individual
plaintiffs
in
this
case,
and
the
most
recent
publication
of
the
state
board
of
elections
containing
the
instructions
for
the
coming
november
5
election,
have
again
been
broadened,
since
this
case,
to
permit
the
illiterate
to
be
classified
with
the
blind
and
either
request
in
assistance
of
a
judge
or
election
or
to
take
in
a
person
of
his
own
choosing.
until
this
case
got
to
this
court,
we
didn't
know
that
there
was
some
issue
of
the
power
structure
or
some
racial
overtone
to
the
case
which
was
certainly
not
clear
in
the
pleadings
and
certainly
not
clear
in
the
court's
opinion,
but
the
most
recent
regulations
promulgated,
published
by
the
state
board
of
elections,
have
been
broadened
to
permit
the
illiterate
to
be
assisted
by
either
a
judge
of
election
or
a
person
of
his
choice.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
that
is
new
regulation.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
no,
it
was
just
published
last
week,
your
honor.
i
have
copies
which
i
can
make
and
hand
it
to
the
clerk.
it
is
on
page
8
of
the
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
yes,
i'll
be
happy
to,
mr.
chief
justice.
my
time
is
up,
i
think.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
as
counsel
for
the
various
virginia
election
officials
in
this
matter,
i
should
like
to
attempt
to
establish
at
the
outset,
that,
if
i
may,
just
what
this
case
involves
and,
perhaps,
the
best
way
to
accomplish
that
is
to
draw
the
court's
attention
to
the
opening
paragraph
of
the
opinion
of
the
court
below
which
is
on
page
67
(a)
of
the
appendix
and
which
contains
all
of
the
operative
facts,
out
of
which
this
case
arose.
in
four
brief
sentences,
the
court
below
has
stated
the
entire
case
presented
by
the
plaintiffs
in
the
trial
court.
it
was
to
the
effect,
in
sentence
one,
that
plaintiffs
are
registered
voters
who
are
unable
to
spell
accurately
or
write
legibly,
who
attempted
to
cast
a
write-in
ballot
in
the
1966
congressional
elections
in
the
fourth
district
of
virginia.
second,
each
one
attempted
to
do
this
by
pasting
on
the
official
ballot
a
sticker
in
which
the
name
of
the
write-in
candidate
had
been
printed
and
voting
for
the
name
printed
on
the
sticker.
third,
these
ballots
were
not
tabulated
in
the
official
returns
for
the
write-in
candidate.
the
fourth
sentence
begins
“upon
these
undisputed
facts,
the
plaintiffs
seek
a
declaratory
judgment
that
rights
secured
to
them
by
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965
have
been
denied.”
now,
we
submit
that
the
only
question
that
can
be
raised
by
that
set
of
facts
is
whether
or
not
the
refusal
of
the
virginia
election
officials,
pursuant
to
virginia
law,
to
count
these
votes
which
were
cast
by
means
of
labels
or
stickers
or
pasters
violated
some
right
secured
to
illiterates
in
the
fourth
district
of
virginia,
a
right
secured
by
the
fourteenth
amendment
or
by
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965.
we
know
full
well
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
does
not
secure
that
right
to
anyone
else
in
the
united
states.
the
fourteenth
amendment
per
se
does
not
even
secure
to
an
illiterate
the
right
to
vote
at
all,
much
less
to
select
the
means
by
which
he
will
vote.
and,
the
cases
are
perfectly
clear
that
the
matter
of
whether
or
not
stickers
and
pasters
shall
be
permitted
as
an
appropriate
means
of
voting
is
a
matter
to
be
determined
by
each
individual
state
and
regardless
of
whether
the
state
permits
it
or
rejects
it.
neither
determination
of
that
question
is
violative
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
the
case
in
the
seventh
circuit
and
the
case
of
morris
versus
fortson
in
the
recent
case
in
georgia,
since
the
enactment
of
the
civil
rights
act
clearly
settles
this
matter.
so,
the
assertion
of
the
plaintiffs
on
this
point
is
that,
of
all
the
people
in
the
united
states,
they
alone,
as
illiterates,
have
a
constitutional
right
to
vote
by
means
of
stickers
and
pasters.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
your
honor,
i
do
not
know
how
it
could
be
secret
otherwise,
but
i'm
not
--
but
i
am
of
the
opinion,
as
was
the
lower
court,
and
certain
that
they
are
not
entitled
to
a
secret
ballot.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
he
could
mark
the
ballot
by
the
name
of
the
individual.
well,
he
could
do
that
under
the
virginia
law.
he
is
simply
requested
to
furnish
him
assistance
and
to
ensure
that
his
ballot
is
marked
in
accordance
with
the
way
he
wants
it.
there's
no
requirement
that
he
must
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
yes.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
that
could
be
done,
if
your
honor
please.
of
course,
the
secrecy
of
his
ballot
will
be
compromised
in
any
event,
to
the
extent
that
he
carries
the
ballot
to
an
election
official
and
asks
him
to
write
joe
douglas'
name
on
it.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
well,
your
honor,
i
do
not
understand
that
he
can
and
i
do
not
understand
that
he
is
required
or
entitled
to
the
complete
secrecy
of
his
ballot
either
by
the
fourteenth
amendment
or
by
the
voting
rights
act.
as
matter
of
fact,
this
is
to
the
contrary.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
only
to
the
extent
that
the
regulations
issued
by
the
general
assembly
of
virginia,
the
statutes
pursuant
to
section
36
of
the
virginia
constitutions,
states
that
in
order
to
obtain
the
uniformity
in
election,
the
general
assembly
of
virginia
shall
enact
laws
governing
the
conduct
of
elections.
and,
virginia
has
enacted
those.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
that
is
also
in
the
constitution,
your
honor,
in
section
26.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
no,
sir,
it
would
not
apply
to
anyone
who
is
physically
handicapped
or
educationally
handicapped.
as
the
cases
made
clear,
the
secrecy
of
the
ballot
of
the
physically
handicapped
or
the
educationally
handicapped
must,
to
some
extent,
be
compromised.
there's
no
other
way
you
can
do
it.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
if
your
honor
please,
in
that
connection,
two
things.
every
state
treats
the
blind
or
a
number
of
states
treat
the
blind
differently,
and
every
state
has
different
methods
of
solving
the
problem,
what
you're
going
to
do
with
the
physically
handicapped
or
the
educationally
handicapped.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
no,
sir,
i
--
we
do
not
object
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
three-judge
court
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
with
respect
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
they
have
a
right
to
cast
that
ballot
by
means
of
stickers
or
pasters,
which
was
the
only
operative
fact
in
this
case.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
with
respect
to
those
facts,
yes.
i
mean,
i
think
in
viewing
the
complaint,
if
your
honor
please,
the
assertion
that
the
virginia
statute
as
it
then
stood
forbid
them
to
cast
ballots
by
this
method
and
the
prayer
for
relief
which
attempted
to
enjoin
it
to
the
extent
that
it
purported
to
require
the
voter
to
cast
his
write-in
vote
in
his
own
handwriting
was
sufficient
for
the
district
judge
in
scanning
that
complaint
to
think
that
the
question
was
not
entirely
frivolous
and
to
call
for
a
three-judge
court.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
that
--
with
respect
to
stickers
or
pasters
on
the
ballot,
your
honor.
in
other
words,
until
this
case
was
argued
here,
i
did
not
know
that
this
was
a
race
case.
i
don't
find
the
word
negro
in
the
complaint.
i
don't
find
it
in
the
court's
opinion.
it
is
not
--
it
is
a
simple
question
of
illiterates.
in
the
lower
court,
it
was
simply
argued
that
these
people
who
were
represented
were
functionally
illiterate
people
without
regard
to
race
or
color.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
no,
sir.
the
only
thing
in
the
voting
rights
--
the
only
argument
made
on
the
voting
rights
act
was
the
test
or
device
proposition
that,
in
requiring
the
individual
to
cast
the
ballot
in
his
own
handwriting,
that
constituted
a
test
or
device.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
and
was
suspended.
but,
that
was
admitted,
if
your
honor
please,
so
there
was
no
case
or
controversy
on
that
in
the
lower
court.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
there
still
isn't.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
it
was,
yes.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
that
is
correct.
and,
within
a
week
after
the
enactment
of
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965,
the
state
board
of
elections
and
the
attorney
general
of
virginia,
together,
issued
a
bulletin.
actually,
it
was
issued
of
course
by
the
state
board
of
elections
which
flatly
states,
which
your
honors
will
find
in
the
record,
that
the
voting
rights
act
had
superseded,
in
so
many
words,
the
virginia
statute
requiring
people
to
register
to
vote
in
their
own
handwriting,
and
directing
the
registrars
in
virginia
to
register
people
who
were
illiterate
and
couching
that
regulation
almost
verbatim
in
the
form
of
the
civil
service
regulation
issued
to
federal
examiners
to
guide
them
in
the
method
by
which
they
would
enroll
illiterate
voters
in
states
affected
by
the
act.
then,
three
weeks
before
the
election,
another
bulletin
was
issued
in
which
the
election
officials
were
instructed
to
assist
illiterate
voters
in
casting
their
ballots
and
broadening
the
provisions
of
the
virginia
statute,
which
adhered
for
limited
assistance
only
to
the
physically
handicapped,
to
include
the
illiterate.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
only
in
the
few
remaining
minutes
of
my
argument,
i
had
intended
to
touch
upon
it,
your
honor,
but
i'm
perfectly
content
to
come
to
it
now.
initially,
significant
in
respect
to
that
memorandum
is
the
fact
that
the
solicitor
general
does
not
have
one
line
in
it,
which
even
contains
a
hint
that
he
was
even
remotely
or
conceivably
supporting
the
position
stated
by
the
appellants
in
this
case.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
that
is
correct
and
we
have
framed
our
response
to
that
both
in
our
memorandum
submitted
at
the
time
and
in
our
brief
that
it
cannot
possibly
be.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
well,
of
course,
i
take
the
position,
your
honor,
that
the
issue
is
not
properly
before
you
because
it
was
not
raised
as
an
issue
in
this
case
and
was
not
passed
upon
by
the
trial
court.
and
so,
that
issue
is
one
injected
at
this,
the
ultimate
level
of
appellate
review,
by
the
solicitor
general.
of
course,
it
is
before
the
court
in
the
sense
that
the
court
invited
the
solicitor
general
to
express
his
views,
and
he
has.
and,
we
do
not
object
to
the
--
to
filing
a
response
to
it
or
to
stating
our
position.
the
only
thing
we
objected
to
is
if
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
no,
sir.
what
we
do
object
to
this,
and
on
this
we
wish
to
be
perfectly
clear,
we
do
object
to
the
solicitor
general
trying
to
turn
this
case
which
was
a
straight
case
to
involving
a
question
of
whether
or
not
a
person
could
vote
by
means
of
a
sticker
or
paster
into
a
case
in
which
a
complaint
had
been
filed
alleging
that
election
officials
had
engaged
in
discriminatory
practices
and
proposed
to
continue
in
those
practices
unless
an
injunction
was
issued
under
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965
requiring
them
to
register
illiterates
or
to
vote
or
to
otherwise
give
up
practices
which
it
obtained
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965.
none
of
those
practices
have
ever
obtained
in
virginia.
virginia
has
never
taken
the
position
that
race
as
an
irrelevance
to
a
citizen's
right
to
vote.
we
took
the
position
for
years
that
race
had
a
great
deal
to
do
with
a
right
of
a
person
to
attend
a
school
or
to
marry.
those
issues
had
been
litigated
and
decided
by
this
court,
but
virginia
has
never
taken
the
position.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
nor,
race
has
any
relation
to
that
and
we
do
not
--
we
object
most
extraneously
to
any
attempt
to
remand
this
case
to
the
district
court
to
enable
the
plaintiffs
to
make
a
new
case
of
it
at
the
district
level.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
yes.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
well,
if
it
--
of
course,
the
solicitor
general
does
make
that
assertion,
mr.
justice
fortas,
and,
of
course,
the
court
can
consider
it.
it
is
not
a
part
of
the
record
brought
up
on
this
appeal.
it
is
not
a
question
raised
by
the
jurisdictional
statement.
it
is
a
question
inserted
by
the
solicitor
general
in
this
court.
now,
envisioning
the
possibility
that
the
court
would
consider
the
argument,
we
have
stated
why
we
feel
that
it
cannot
possibly
be
correct
that
the
bulletins
issued
in
this
case
were
a
practice
or
procedure
within
the
meaning
of
section
5
(a)
and,
it
is
so
obvious
to
us
that
it
cannot
be,
that
we
do
not
see
how
there
can
be
two
sides
of
the
question.
if
it
was
a
practice
or
procedure,
it
would
mean
that
when
the
voting
rights
act
became
effective
in
virginia
on
august
the
7,
1965,
there
was
nothing
that
the
virginia
election
officials
could
do
about
it,
except
continue
to
violate
it.
this
bulletin
was
issued
within
a
week
of
the
voting
rights
act
becoming
effective
and
it
told
the
virginia
election
officials
that
the
voting
rights
act
was
then
enforced
in
virginia
and,
despite
the
provisions
of
virginia
law
which
do
not
permit
illiterates
to
register,
you
are
to
begin
to
register
them.
now,
under
the
solicitor
general's
argument,
we
couldn't
do
that
until
we
had
taken
that
regulation
and
submitted
it
to
the
attorney
general.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
now,
suppose
we
had
never
written
the
regulation.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
suppose
we
waited
ten
months
to
write
it,
what
is
suppose
to
happen
to
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965
in
virginia
in
the
interim
if
we
cannot
enforce
a
bulletin
which
says
these
instructions
implement
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965?
the
voting
rights
act
has
superseded
the
provisions
in
virginia
laws
which
forbid
illiterates
to
register
and
forbid
them
to
vote,
and
you
are
now
required
by
this
prevailing
supervening
federal
law
to
register
illiterates.
we
did
that
even
before
south
carolina
against
katzenbach
was
filed
in
this
court
and
it
prevailed,
and
illiterates
were
being
registered
in
virginia
and
were
being
voted
in
virginia
in
contravention
of
virginia
law
while
south
carolina
against
katzenbach
was
being
argued
in
this
court.
and,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
we
issued
those
bulletins
in
1965.
we
passed
through
the
general
election
of
1965
without
a
murmur.
we
continued
for
another
year.
we
have
still
had
no
difficulty
with
it,
until
the
question
of
voting
for
s.w.
tucker
by
means
of
a
sticker
or
paster
in
the
1966
congressional
elections
arose.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
yes,
sir.
one,
how
they
may
register
and,
another,
how
they
may
vote.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states?
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
i
say
that
they
are
not
a
regulation
under
section
5
(a)
which
he
is
required
to
approve
in
advance.
i
do
not
say
he
has
nothing
to
do
with
it.
the
attorney
general
has
brought
a
number
of
suits.
if
he
thinks
that
these
are
improper
regulations,
he
can
bring
a
suit
to
establish
it.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
that's
correct.
that
is
our
position,
and
we
state
that
the
propositions
under
the
facts
of
this
case
that
if
that
is
so,
then
there
were
a
number
of
the
illiterates
voted
at
the
1965
election
who
would
not
have
been
if
we
had
been
required
to
submit
that
matter
to
the
attorney
general
and
wait
for
60
days
for
him
to
express
his
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
the
whole
question
is
not
before
you,
your
honor.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
no,
sir.
i
submit
that
if
that
is
put
out,
of
course,
i
submit
that,
at
any
time
after
the
passage
of
the
voting
rights
act,
the
legislature
should
amend
its
election
laws.
they
are,
under
the
voting
rights
act,
superficially
at
least
required
to
submit
them
to
the
attorney
general
and,
as
the
attorney
gen
--
solicitor
general
admits,
a
number
of
them
are
and
they
are
permitted
to
be
enforced
even
though
they
have
not
been
officially
avowed
or
disavowed
by
the
attorney
general.
but,
i
am
submitting
to
your
honors
that
these
instructions
which
were
issued
immediately
after
the
act
became
effective,
implementing
the
act
were
not
such
instructions
as
were
required
to
be
submitted
to
solicitor
general.
the
--
otherwise,
it
would
mean
that
the
solicitor
general
was
empowered
to
suspend
the
operation
of
the
voting
rights
act
for
a
period
of
60
days
or
that
the
election
officials
were
empowered
to
do
it
simply
by
not
submitting
anything
to
the
solicitor
general
and
say,
“we're
sorry,
we
can't
help
you.
when
a
process
of
getting
together
a
regulation
for
the
registration
of
illiterates
and
the
voting
of
the
illiterates.
when
we
get
it
together,
there's
still
nothing
we
can
do.
we've
got
to
submit
it
to
the
solicitor
--
to
the
attorney
general.
after
that,
we've
got
to
wait
60
days
and,
if
election
comes
up
in
that
time
and
we
haven't
heard
from
him,
you
won't
be
able
to
vote
because
we
can't
do
it.”
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
somebody
should
have
the
authority
to
obey
the
federal
--
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965.
that's
the
way
we
viewed
it
in
virginia,
if
your
honor
please.
that's
why
we
put
out
the
regulations.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
well,
they,
so
far
as
section
5
(a)
of
course,
if
that's
kind
of
a
regulation,
it's
got
to
come
to
the
district
court
of
the
district
of
columbia.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
i
don't
understand
that
any
other
district
court
is
open
for
that
question
of
the
validity
of
a
regulation
if
it
is
enforced
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
unless
they
could,
of
course,
get
immediate
action
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
dis
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
district
of
columbia.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
yes,
sir.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
no,
i
think
it's
alternatives.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
yes,
and
of
course
the
solicitor
general
could
approve
or
he
could
wait
60
days.
the
law
reads
that
if
you
do
not
--
if
there
is
no
objection
filed
by
the
solicitor
general
or
the
attorney
general
within
60
days,
then
it
may
be
put
into
effect.
now,
there
had
been
number
of
cases,
gentlemen,
in
which
this
issue
has
been
raised
in
louisiana,
in
georgia,
in
alabama,
and
in
mississippi.
in
each
of
those
cases,
the
relief
granted
by
the
district
court
sitting
in
those
cases,
so
far
as
illiterates
are
concerned,
has
been
to
require
the
local
election
officials
to
assist
the
illiterates,
and
specific
provision
has
been
made.
none
of
those
cases
permit
anyone
other
than
an
election
official
to
assist
the
illiterate
in
casting
his
vote
even
though,
in
those
states,
the
physically
handicapped
or
the
blind
may
be
helped
by
a
member
of
their
family
or
a
person
of
their
choice.
in
the
cases
which
we
have
catalogued
in
our
brief,
united
states
against
mississippi,
morris
against
fortson,
united
states
against
executive
committee,
and
united
states
against
louisiana,
the
relief
granted
by
federal
district
courts
under
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965
is
limited
to
permitting
only
election
officials
to
aid
the
illiterate
who
had
been
enfranchised
by
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965.
specifically,
in
united
states
against
louisiana,
that
was
true,
and
the
court
added
that
nothing
contained
in
this
order
shall
affect
any
of
the
state
provision
relating
to
the
casting
of
votes
by
the
physically
handicapped
or
the
blind.
now,
at
that
time,
the
physically
handicapped
and
the
blind
were
not
permitted
to
be
aided
by
election
officials
but
could
take
a
friend
of
their
choice
if
their
blind
or,
if
they
were
otherwise
physically
handicapped,
a
member
of
their
family.
yet,
when
the
decree
was
entered
in
that
case,
assistance
to
illiterate
voters
was
limited
by
the
court
solely
to
election
officials
aiding
the
voters.
and,
that
is
true
in
each
of
the
four
cases
which
are
mentioned
in
the
solicitor
general's
memorandum
and
which
we
have
analyzed
in
our
brief.
now,
we
cannot
believe
that
the
attorney
general
of
virginia
is
required
to
outdo
judge
wisdom,
judge
christenberry,
judge
bell
or
the
judges
of
the
fifth
circuit
and
go
further
and
say,
and
what's
more
in
virginia
you
may
cast
a
vote
if
you
are
illiterate
by
means
of
a
sticker
or
paster.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
it
has
never
been
proved.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
well,
if
the
court
decides
that
that
alternative
is
the
problem,
it
would
of
course
then,
i
assume,
delay
consideration
of
the
other
questions
until
the
matter
had
been
--
and
perhaps
the
court
would
remand
it
to
the
district
court
and
with
instructions
to
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
yes,
your
honor,
but
you
would
not
delay
reaching
the
question
of
whether
or
not
virginia's
requirement
that
the
voter
vote
in
his
own
handwriting
is
constitutional
because,
of
course,
that
is
not
a
requirement
any
longer.
you
don't
reach
the
requirement
because
it
isn't
there.
nobody
is
required
to
insert
a
write-in
vote
in
his
own
handwriting
if
he
is
physically
or
educationally
handicapped.
that
is
the
very
statute
that
the
attorney
general
said
had
been
superseded
and
could
no
longer
be
enforced.
so
that,
you
will
never
reach
that
question,
unless
of
course
it
is
to
be
fabricated
because
this
case
was
one
in
which
the
plaintiffs
came
in
and
said,
in
effect,
“your
statute
requiring
a
write-in
vote
to
be
cast
in
the
voter's
handwriting
has
been
superseded.”
and,
our
response
was
“you're
quite
right,
it
has,
and
we
said
so
over
a
year
ago
in
a
bulletin.”
now
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
where
is
the
case
of
controversy?
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
the
validity
of
what?
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
stickers?
no,
sir.
except
in
the
opinion
of
the
attorney
general.
virginia
statutes
require
ballots
which
are
printed.
if
people
want
to
mark
their
ballots,
mark
them
in
a
certain
way,
that's
mandatory.
assistance
must
be
given
in
a
certain
way.
that's
the
only
provision
made
for
assistance.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
sticker
voting
is
not
permitted
not
because
there
is
a
statute
that
says
that
it's
not
permitted,
but
because
the
statute
prescribed
a
method
by
which
ballots
shall
be
marked
and
assistance
should
be
given
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
the
only
thing
that
i
think
can
possibly
be
before
your
honors
for
decision
is
whether
or
not
a
fourteenth
amendment
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
per
se
or
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965
guarantees
anyone
the
right
to
vote
by
means
of
a
sticker
or
paster
in
violation
of
the
state
law
to
the
contrary.
that's
the
only
thing
i
think
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
i
--
yes.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
yes,
sir,
because
that,
as
i
say
as
implemented
by
the
regulation,
the
illiterate
is
now
granted
the
same
right
to
assistance
as
the
physically
handicapped
and,
therefore,
you
have
to
read
the
statute
as
implemented
by
the
regulations.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
that
is
correct.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
well,
it's
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
it's
only
--
only
in
illiterates
because
that's
the
only
class
represented
here,
your
honor.
the
physically
handicapped
are
not
even
in
here,
nor
any
racial
classifications
in
here,
only
the
illiterates,
as
a
class,
is
the
only
class
that
is
here.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
only,
yes,
or
without
the
means
of
stickers
or
pasters
because
that,
you
see,
is
the
operative
factor
of
this
case.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
the
action
which
caused
this
case
to
arise,
mr.
justice
white
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
was
the
fact
that
these
votes
were
cast
in
this
manner
and
were
not
counted.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
and,
the
action
that's
challenged
here
is
whether
or
not
that
failure
of
the
election
officials
to
count
these
votes
cast
by
means
of
stickers
or
pasters
violates
some
rights
secured
to
these
plaintiffs
by
the
equal
protection
clause
or
the
voting
rights
act.
there's
nothing
suggested
that
anybody
else
is
permitted
to
vote
by
means
of
stickers
or
pasters.
they're
not.
there's
no
question
of
discrimination
here
in
that
respect
at
all.
i
would
simply
point
out
there
is
--
that
there
is
no
hesitancy
on
the
part
of
virginia
so
far
as
the
persons
who
may
render
assistance
are
concerned,
with
respect
to
the
individual
plaintiffs
in
this
case,
and
the
most
recent
publication
of
the
state
board
of
elections
containing
the
instructions
for
the
coming
november
5
election,
have
again
been
broadened,
since
this
case,
to
permit
the
illiterate
to
be
classified
with
the
blind
and
either
request
in
assistance
of
a
judge
or
election
or
to
take
in
a
person
of
his
own
choosing.
until
this
case
got
to
this
court,
we
didn't
know
that
there
was
some
issue
of
the
power
structure
or
some
racial
overtone
to
the
case
which
was
certainly
not
clear
in
the
pleadings
and
certainly
not
clear
in
the
court's
opinion,
but
the
most
recent
regulations
promulgated,
published
by
the
state
board
of
elections,
have
been
broadened
to
permit
the
illiterate
to
be
assisted
by
either
a
judge
of
election
or
a
person
of
his
choice.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
that
is
new
regulation.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
no,
it
was
just
published
last
week,
your
honor.
i
have
copies
which
i
can
make
and
hand
it
to
the
clerk.
it
is
on
page
8
of
the
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine,
iii
yes,
i'll
be
happy
to,
mr.
chief
justice.
my
time
is
up,
i
think.
