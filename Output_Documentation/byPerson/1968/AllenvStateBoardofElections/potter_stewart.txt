justice
potter
stewart
over
--
that
was
over
14
years
of
age?
justice
potter
stewart
who
were
illiterates.
justice
potter
stewart
what
it
does
do,
doesn't
it,
is
equate
illiterate
people
or
include
illiterate
people
in
that
group
covered
by
section
24-251?
justice
potter
stewart
it
attempts
to
do
that?
justice
potter
stewart
of
course,
that
was
about
two
years
ago,
for
the
election
two
years
ago,
wasn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
but,
i
suppose
if
it
--
if
whether
or
not
there
was
authority
to
do
it
is
--
might
--
probably
a
matter
of
state
law
and
if
virginia
tells
us
that,
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
there's
authority
to
do
it,
then
that's
probably
the
answer,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
so
does
anybody
else
who
is
physically
unable
to
prepare
his
ballot
without
aid.
justice
potter
stewart
so,
you
may
be
right,
but
it's
hardly
an
equal
protection
claim
except
in
so
far
as
you
--
those
people
are
grouped
somewhat
differently
from
blind
people.
justice
potter
stewart
and
there
may
be
all
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
--
what
virginia
has
forbidden
and
prohibited
is
the
use
of
stickers
to
anybody,
illiterate
or
literate,
handicapped
or
unhandicapped,
blind
or
not
blind.
nobody,
no
voter,
in
virginia
can
use
a
sticker,
isn't
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
isn't
that
so?
justice
potter
stewart
there's
an
attorney
general's
opinion
also,
isn't
there?
justice
potter
stewart
of
his
own
family
--
is
that
new
regulation
in
--
justice
potter
stewart
have
you
submitted
that
mr.
--
justice
potter
stewart
anyone
who's
ever
voted
in
a
pri
--
party
primary?
justice
potter
stewart
the
last
proceeding
--
justice
potter
stewart
or
the
primary
--
justice
potter
stewart
for
this
election.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
lichtman,
when
you
answered
mr.
justice
harlan
that
you
thought
a
statute
submitted
to
the
attorney
general
would've
been
approved,
now
was
that
answer
with
relation
to
the
question
he
put
to
you
namely
a
statewide
statute
or
are
you
saying
that
at
this
statute?
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
--
is
that
your
view?
justice
potter
stewart
saying
it
might
have
happened
as
to
this
statute?
justice
potter
stewart
in
any
event
you're
not
making
any
submission
that
this
one
ought
to
have
clearance
from
the
attorney
general.
justice
potter
stewart
on
the
other
hand,
i
don't
see
why
you
need
to
make
any
submission
that
this
may
be
violative
of
the
fifteenth
amendment
or
may
be
discriminatory,
or
anything
else.
it
seems
to
me
that,
as
you
read
section
5,
that
any
change
since
--
from
the
way
--
from
the
status
quo
of
november
1,
1964,
no
matter
how
enlightened,
no
matter
how
well-motivated,
and
no
matter
how
trivial
is
covered
by
the
language
of
the
statute
and,
from
then
on,
it's
up
to
the
attorney
general.
and,
if
he
acts
then
if
people
are
dissatisfied
with
his
decision,
then
it's
up
to
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia.
justice
potter
stewart
why
do
you
have
to
submit
to
us
that
this
may
be
a
discriminatory
or
an
evilly
motivated
change?
if
you're
right
about
the
meaning
of
the
--
of
section
5,
it
could
be
the
most
purely
motivated,
the
most
progressive,
and
enlightened
or,
as
i
say,
the
most
trivial
change
in
the
world,
and
yet
it
comes
under
section
5.
justice
potter
stewart
legislative
or,
clearly,
any
political
subdivision.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
mr.
pollak,
let's
assume
that
you
just
said
frankly
that,
with
respect
to
one
or
more
of
these
changes
which
are
involved
here,
that
you
had
no
objection
to
them,
that
if
they
were
submitted,
it
was
submitted,
you
would
approve
it.
in
that
particular
case,
would
you
think
that
there
ought
to
be
new
elections?
let's
assume
that
the
super
--
let's
assume
that
the
qualification
case,
you
thought
that
was
a
perfectly
good
provision,
and
let's
assume
that,
tomorrow,
the
state
of
mississippi
submitted
it
to
you
and
you
approved
it
in
writing,
what
do
you
think
this
court
or
the
district
court
should
do
in
this
case?
it
was
no
law.
even
if
you
win,
it
still
--
it
was
no
law
until
you
approved
it.
justice
potter
stewart
and
if
there
were
new
--
certainly,
if
there
were
new
elections,
it
would
be
held
under
the
new
law
because
it
is
a
law
then.
justice
potter
stewart
and
--
but
what
if
the
attorney
general
turns
it
down
and
the
state
promptly
files
suit
to
save
a
day
with
the
district
of
columbia
court.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
then
that
brings
us
back
to
the
question
asked
to
you
by
the
chief
justice.
if
the
court
should
agree
with
you
on
the
basic
merits,
i
didn't
quite
understand
what
you
think
the
proper
disposition
of
these
cases
should
be.
remanded
to
the
district
court,
you
said,
and
then
what?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
but
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
people
now
hold
office
as
result
of
these
laws,
so
we
have
to
think
a
little
bit
beyond
what
you
said.
justice
potter
stewart
that
would
be
helpful
to
me
from
--
if
you
would
like
to
do
that
and,
from
your
position,
as
amicus
to
show
what
your
thinking
would
be
in
the
event
that
would
be
--
justice
potter
stewart
how
many
counties
are
there
in
mississippi?
justice
potter
stewart
how
many
counties
are
there
in
mississippi?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
82?
justice
potter
stewart
of
course
that
--
that
may
well
be,
but
that
really
is
entirely
irrelevant
to
the
issue
here
before
this
court,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
section
5.
justice
potter
stewart
over
--
that
was
over
14
years
of

justice
potter

who

justice
