mr.
norman
c.
amaker
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
on
appeal
here
from
a
three-judge
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
virginia
presents
two
issues
of
first
impression
in
this
court:
one
constitutional,
the
other
statutory.
respecting
the
right
of
illiterates
who,
as
a
consequence
of
the
passage
of
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965,
became
eligible
to
vote
for
the
first
time
in
virginia
and
elsewhere
to
cast
a
secret
ballot
for
the
candidate
of
their
choice
and
to
have
that
ballot
counted
for
their
candidate
just
as
every
other
qualified
voter
in
the
state
of
virginia.
that
constitutional
question
is
whether
these
illiterates
who,
by
the
last
census,
were
more
than
3%
of
the
persons
in
virginia
over
14
years
of
age,
can,
consistent
with
the
fourteenth
amendment,
be
barred,
via
equal
protection
clause
of
that
amendment,
be
barred
from
protecting
their
right
to
a
secret
ballot
by
use
of
a
gum
sticker
bearing
the
name
of
the
candidate
of
their
choice.
in
face
of
a
virginia
statute
requiring
that
any
write-in
vote
be
in
the
voter's
own
handwriting,
the
statutory
issue
is
whether
the
handwriting
provision
of
this
statute
which
is
virginia
code
section
24-252,
the
text
of
which
is
at
page
2
of
our
brief
and
at
page
68
(a)
of
the
appendix,
is
a
test
or
device
prohibited
by
subsection
4
(a)
of
the
voting
rights
act,
the
complete
text
of
that
section
is
at
page
5
--
begins
at
page
5
of
our
brief.
our
contention
on
the
constitutional
issue
is
that
the
equal
protection
clause
is
violated,
because
illiterates
who
want
to
cast
a
write-in
vote
without
disclosing
the
nature
of
that
vote
to
state
officials
are
prevented
from
doing
so,
while
virginia
has
provided
for
the
protection
of
the
secrecy
of
the
ballot
for
other
classes
of
voters.
on
the
voting
rights
act
issue,
we
assert
the
refusal
to
count
the
illiterate's
write-in
ballots,
which
is
what
occurred
here,
as
a
denial
of
the
right
to
vote,
as
defined
in
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965,
by
using
a
prohibited
test
or
device.
now,
at
the
threshold,
because
this
court
postponed
decision
as
to
jurisdiction,
is
the
question
of
the
court's
jurisdiction
to
decide
these
issues
on
this
appeal?
the
appeal,
of
course,
is
based
on
28
u.s.c.
section
1253,
in
that
the
appeal
is
from
an
order
denying
a
permanent
injunction
in
a
civil
action
required
to
be
heard
and
determined
by
a
district
court
of
three
judges.
the
argument
that
the
case
is
one
that
is
required
to
be
heard
by
a
three-judge
court
is
of
course
based
on
28
u.s.c.
section
2281.
the
argument
is
in
our
brief
beginning
at
pages
23.
in
sum,
it
is
as
follows:
first,
that
28
u.s.c.
section
2281
requires
a
three-judge
court
to
hear
a
case
seeking
an
injunction
against
the
enforcement
of
a
state
statute
on
the
ground
of
its
unconstitutionality.
that
is
the
claim
that
appellants
presented
to
the
district
court
here.
second,
the
complaint
met
the
formal
requirements
for
invoking
the
three-judge
court
jurisdiction.
the
single
district
judge
who
received
the
application
for
the
three-judge
court
acted
routinely
on
the
application
and,
indeed,
the
three-judge
court
itself
never
raised
any
question
as
to
its
jurisdiction
and
proceeded
to
decide
the
case
on
the
merits
of
both
the
constitutional
and
the
statutory
issue.
fourth,
the
appellees
never
raised
any
question
as
to
jurisdiction
in
the
district
court,
and
i
do
not
understand
their
brief
in
this
court
to
be
raising
any
question
as
to
jurisdiction
now.
fifth,
certainly,
the
constitutional
question
is
a
substantial
one.
it's
one
of
first
impression
and,
consequently,
it
has
not
been
foreclosed
by
any
prior
decisions
of
this
court,
and
the
inclusion
of
the
statutory
claim
under
the
voting
rights
act
did
not
operate
to
divest
the
three-judge
court
of
the
jurisdiction
that
it
acquired
as
a
consequence
of
appellant's
constitutional
claim.
and
finally,
what
is
obvious,
virginia
code
section
24-252
is
a
statute
of
statewide
applicability
in
virginia,
and
so
there
is
no
question
of
dealing
with
a
statute
only
local
in
application.
we
also
joined
in
our
brief
and
arguments,
beginning
at
page
28,
an
alternate
jurisdictional
ground
under
subsection
4
(a)
of
the
voting
rights
act,
but
it
seems
that
the
constitutional
basis
for
the
jurisdiction
of
the
three-judge
court
is
sufficient
and,
with
the
court's
permission,
i'd
just
like
to
pass
on
to
the
merits.
now,
turning
to
the
merits,
i
think
it's
important
to
state
a
couple
of
propositions.
first,
the
court
is
not
being
asked
to
rule
on
the
question
of
whether
the
fourteenth
amendment
prevents
a
state
from
barring
the
use
of
stickers
by
all
segments
of
the
electorate
at
any
time.
now,
to
the
extent
that
the
state
courts,
a
handful
of
them,
themselves
have
dealt
with
that
question,
the
majority
view
has
upheld
the
right
to
use
stickers
and
those
cases
are
cited
both
in
our
brief
and
in
the
brief
of
the
appellees.
nor
is
the
court
being
asked
to
deal
with
a
question
of
whether
virginia
had
the
right
to
set
a
voter
qualification
because
the
effect
of
the
voting
rights
act
on
this
proceeding
was
to
enfranchise
illiterates.
so,
the
real
question
before
this
court
is
one
of
the
state's
responsibilities
toward
illiterates
who
are
qualified
voters
with
respect
to
two
areas.
first,
the
preservation
of
the
secrecy
of
their
ballot
and,
second,
with
respect
to
the
assurance,
the
certainty
to
them
that
the
ballot
will
be
counted
for
the
candidate
of
their
choice,
thus,
preserving
their
right
to
choose.
now,
these
issues
arise
out
of
the
following
circumstances.
samuel
tucker,
a
well-known
negro
civil
rights
lawyer
was
running
as
a
write-in
candidate
for
congress
in
the
last
congressional
election
in
1966
from
virginia's
fourth
congressional
district.
now,
the
fourth
congressional
district
of
virginia
is
in
an
area
that's
commonly
called
southside
virginia,
and
it
is
an
area
in
which
there
exists
the
largest
black
population
in
the
state
and
also
the
largest
percentage
of
the
state's
illiterates.
the
last
census
indicated
that
persons
over
14
years
of
age
in
that
district,
approximately
94,000,
were
persons
who
were
illiterate
and
--
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
i'm
sorry.
the
figure
i
gave
you,
mr.
justice
stewart,
was
for
the
state
of
virginia
at
large.
the
state
as
a
whole
had
--
in
the
fourth
congressional
district
had
22.9%
of
persons
over
25
years
of
age.
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
now,
on
the
ballot
were
listed
two
white
candidates,
the
incumbent,
mr.
watkins
abbott
who
had
been,
to
that
point,
serving
in
the
congress
for
20
years
since
the
80th
congress,
and
his
opponent,
the
republican
candidate,
mr.
silva.
now,
mr.
tucker,
who
had
run
in
the
previous
congressional
election
and
who
was
then
listed
on
the
ballot,
did
not
qualify
in
time
for
his
name
to
be
listed
on
the
ballot
in
this
election
and
he
was
later
urged
to
run
as
a
write-in
candidate
by
his
supporters
who
were
in
the
main
negroes
who
wanted
no
part
of
either
candidate
who
was
listed
on
the
ballot.
now,
they
sought
to
maximize
the
vote
for
tucker
by
inclusion
of
this
relatively
substantial
number
of
newly
enfranchised
illiterates
who,
as
the
district
court
found,
were,
and
i
think
this
language
is
of
some
significance,
were
registered
voters
but
who
were
unable
to
spell
accurately
or
to
write
legibly.
now,
as
the
court
found,
just
to
consider
the
choices
that
confronted
the
persons
in
these
situations,
it
seems
to
be
there
were
three.
one,
of
course,
was
not
to
vote
at
all.
second,
of
course,
was
to
vote
for
someone
whose
name
was
on
the
ballot
that
they
didn't
want.
and,
third,
was
to
disclose
their
vote
to
white
state
election
officials
who,
pursuant
to
virginia
law,
are
appointees
of
the
dominant
political
parties
in
the
state
in
an
area
like
southside
virginia,
an
area
which
includes
prince
edward
county
which
is
familiar
to
this
court
from
prior
litigation,
an
area
in
which
they
could
anticipate
the
kinds
of
things
that
the
civil
rights
commission
reports
has
highlighted
and,
indeed,
the
kinds
of
things
that
were
the
--
resulted
in
the
passage
of
the
voting
rights
act
in
the
first
place.
so,
to
solve
the
dual
problem
of
being
able
to
exercise
a
choice
but,
at
the
same
time,
trying
to
keep
that
choice
hidden
from
the
dominant
white
political
apparatus
which
had
opposed
for
decades
the
participation
of
black
members
of
the
electorate,
they
used
what
to
them
was
a
very
simple
means
of
having
printed
gum
stickers,
just
the
form
that
i'm
demonstrating
here
where
this
is
plaintiff's
exhibit
1,
it's
in
the
record,
which
simply
said
s.w.
tucker.
the
point
being
that
the
illiterate
person,
when
he
went
to
the
polls,
could
simply
tape,
stick,
put
that
on
the
ballot,
fold
his
ballot
and,
in
accordance
with
the
virginia
procedure,
hand
it
to
the
election
official
for
deposit
in
the
ballot
box.
now,
the
proposition
that's
urged
by
virginia
is
that
the
use
of
stickers
is
per
se
invalid
and
apparently,
in
reading
the
district
court's
opinion,
that
court
thought
that
this
was
a
central
issue
in
the
case
and
that
the
virginia
legislature
had
forbidden
their
use
in
total.
but,
i
think
this,
of
course,
misses
the
point
which
is
that
once
these
persons
were
enfranchised
by
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965,
it
became
the
virginia's
responsibility
to
provide
some
means
for
assuring
the
secrecy
and
the
certainty
of
the
ballot
among
all
its
qualified
voters.
and,
in
fact,
virginia
has,
and
prior
to
the
1965
voting
rights
act,
made
accommodations
with
respect
to
these
qualities
with
respect
to
other
classes
of
voters.
virginia's
constitution
itself
guarantees
the
right
of
secrecy
of
the
ballot
and
there
are
several
other
provisions
in
the
state's
code,
all
of
which
fixed
on
the
importance
of
keeping
the
ballot's
secret,
but
virginia
has
not
done
this
in
the
case
of
these
illiterates.
rather,
among
all
the
voters
who
are
qualified,
it
has
set
up
classes
of
voters
and
discriminated
among
them
both
with
respect
to
the
question
of
the
secrecy
of
the
ballot,
with
respect
to
the
assurance
to
the
voter
that
his
vote
will
in
fact
be
counted
for
the
candidate
of
his
choice
and
in
an
additional
respect
too,
particularly
as
regard
to
illiterates.
virginia
has
made
it
easier
for
the
illiterate
to
vote
for
a
candidate
whose
name
is
listed
on
the
ballot
but
it
has
made
it
--
it
is
discriminated
with
respect
to
an
illiterate
who
chooses
to
vote
for
a
candidate
who's
running
a
write-in
campaign.
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
no,
that's
not
entirely
right,
mr.
justice
fortas.
first
of
all,
there
is
nothing
incumbent
in
the
statute
which
does
that.
what
you
have
reference
to
is
in
a
vote-in
which
was
sent
by
the
secretary
of
the
state
board
of
elections
to
all
the
judges
of
election
in
october
of
1965.
it's
plaintiff's
--
it's
defendant's
exhibit
4
on
page
--
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
that's
the
point.
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
that's
correct.
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
the
--
now
--
so,
the
question
is
what
about
the
illiterates
who
desire
to
cast
write-in
votes,
as
did
the
appellants
here,
and
when
it's
obvious
that
the
--
there,
under
the
state's
own
categories
that
they
set
up
for
protecting
the
secrecy
of
the
vote,
are
the
least-favored
class.
let's
just
see
what
these
differences
are
with
respect
to
each
of
the
three
things
which
i
think
are
extremely
important
here,
the
question
of
secrecy,
the
question
of
what
i
call
certainty
or
the
surety
that
the
vote
will
in
fact
be
cast
for
the
person
that
the
person
intends
it
to
be
cast
for,
and
with
respect
to
the
difficulty
between
voting
a
listed
as
opposed
--
voting
for
a
listed
candidate
as
opposed
to
voting
for
a
write-in
candidate.
now,
of
course,
the
literate
voter
is
fully
protected
on
all
of
these
scores.
whether
it's
a
voting
machine
or
whether
it's
a
ballot
box,
he
can
vote
in
absolute
secrecy.
he
can,
himself,
assure
that
his
vote
is
cast
for
the
candidate
of
his
choice
and
there
is
no
discernable
problem
between
voting
for
a
candidate
whose
name
is
on
the
ballot
as
oppose
to
writing
in
a
name,
except
the
small
amount
of
inconvenience
that
it
takes
to
write
the
name.
now,
the
statute
that
mr.
justice
fortas
referred
to,
24
section
251,
it's
reproduced
in
our
brief
at
page
3,
sets
up
other
categories
for
voters
who,
in
some
sense,
have
to
be
--
had
to
be
singled
out
for
special
treatment,
and
let's
see
what
virginia
has
done
with
them.
first,
there's
a
category
of
a
blind
voter.
now,
obviously,
because
the
blind
voter
is
under
a
special
disability,
virginia
has
taken
some
steps
to
assure
the
capacity
for
him
to
make
his
vote
effective
in
all
these
ways
that
i've
indicated.
but,
what
it
has
done
is
to
say
that
the
blind
voter
can
be
assisted
in
casting
his
vote
either
a
write-in
or
voting
for
someone
who's
listed
by
a
person
who
--
of
his
selection.
that
person,
of
course,
can
be
a
trusted
friend.
it's
done
one
additional
thing
which
it
hasn't
done
in
the
case
of
the
illiterates.
it
has
provided
criminal
sanctions
to
enforce
the
right
of
the
blind
voter
to
secrecy,
the
right
of
the
blind
voter
to
make
sure
that
his
ballot
is
in
fact
cast
for
the
person
that
he
intended
it
to.
now,
the
physically
handicapped
voter
is
one
who
can
be
assisted
only
by
an
election
judge
which
he
can
designate,
and
there
are
criminal
sanctions
as
in
the
case
of
a
blind
voter,
but
what
the
physically
handicapped
voter
has
to
do
then,
even
though
he's
protected
with
respect
to
being,
himself,
physically
able
to
see
how
his
vote
is
cast
so
that
he
can
himself
determine
whether
in
fact
the
vote
is
being
cast
for
the
person
that
he
intend
it,
he
has
to
give
up
some
measure
of
his
secrecy
but,
again,
there
is
a
sanction.
the
same
applies
to
that
small,
right
now
it's
a
very
small,
category
of
persons
who
were
born
before
1904,
persons
who
would
be
over
80
years
of
age,
persons
who
are
rather
registered
before
1904,
but
the
illiterate,
under
virginia
law
as
it
presently
stands,
must
sac
--
for
a
sacrifice
of
his
secrecy
to
a
state
official,
if
he
chooses
to
vote
in
accordance
with
the
election
bulletin,
there
is
no
criminal
sanction
to
enforce
the
--
his
right
of
secrecy
as
opposed
to
the
state
election
official.
he
has
no
assurance
both
because
he's
very
much
like
the
blind
voter,
he
can't
really
see
how
the
ballot's
being
marked
and
because
there
is
no
criminal
sanction,
he
has
no
real
assurance
that
the
vote
is
going
to
be
cast
for
the
candidate
that
he
intends
it
to
be
cast
for.
and,
he
suffers
also
a
substantial
discrimination
with
respect
to
his
capacity
to
vote
for
a
write-in
candidate
as
opposed
to
a
listed
candidate.
now,
what
we've
called
in
our
brief,
this
“crazy
quilt
of
classification”
has
been
condemned
by
this
court
in
a
variety
of
other
context
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
and
we
cited
some
of
those
cases
in
our
brief.
carrington
and
rash,
rinaldi
and
yeager,
the
skinner
v.
oklahoma
dealing
with
the
compulsory
oklahoma
sterilization
law.
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
yes,
i
think
it's
--
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
there's
no
sanction,
and
the
equal
protection
point,
of
course,
is
that,
with
respect
to
the
other
classes
of
voters,
all
of
whom,
like
the
illiterates,
are
qualified,
there
is
--
virginia
has
made
some
attempt.
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
i
know
of
none.
virginia
says
that
the
reason
for
the
issuance
of
the
election
voting,
which
is
clear,
was
the
passage
of
the
voting
rights
act.
virginia
prior
--
as
did
several
other
states,
prior
to
the
passage
of
that,
had
made
no
provisions
for
illiterates
at
all.
it
obviously,
particularly
as
a
consequence
of
this
court's
decision
in
lassiter,
felt
that
it
was
under
no
obligation.
so,
when
the
voting
rights
act
was
passed
in
1965,
virginia,
for
the
first
time,
tried
to
accommodate
itself
to
the
new
requirement
and
this
election
--
electoral
bulletin
is
the
result.
now,
that's
deficient
in
several
respects,
but
the
most
important
respect,
it
seems
to
me,
in
addition
to
the
fact
that
there
is
no
sanction,
is
the
fact
that
even
assuming
the
sanction
the
other
very
important
consideration,
very
important
at
least
in
the
minds
of
the
persons
who
attempted
to
use
the
stickers
in
this
election
is
the
fact
that
they
would
nevertheless
have
to
divulge
the
nature
of
their
vote
to
a
state
election
official.
so,
the
electoral
bulletin
really
does
not
need
that
aspect
of
the
problem.
the
--
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
i'm
not
sure
if
it
--
well,
i
think
that's
what
it
attempts
to
do.
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
it
attempts
to
do
that.
i
think
it's
interesting
to
note
that
certain
terms
of
the
last
election
that
nobody
who
voted
at
that
time
knew
anything
about
this.
this
bulletin,
the
first
time
anybody
heard
about
it
was
when
it's
introduced
in
--
when
it
was
raised
in
a
brief
that
was
filed
in
the
district
court
in
response
to
a
motion
of
summary
judgment.
the
--
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
but
the
--
yes,
the
election
was
two
years
ago,
but
the
bulletin
had
been
issued
in
october
of
the
previous
year,
a
couple
of
months
after
the
passage
of
the
voting
rights
act.
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
no,
i
don't
think
that's
the
answer
in
so
far
as
you
have
to
give
up
a
very
substantial
com
--
part
of
your
secrecy
to
a
votes
--
to
a
voting
official.
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
well,
but
--
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
well,
i
think
that
the
closest
approximation,
mr.
justice
stewart,
if
you
want
to
make
one,
is
to
the
persons
who
are
blind.
but,
if
that
--
but
because
the
illiterate,
like
the
blind
person,
is
incapable
of
really
seeing
the
ballot
in
terms
of
making
sure
that
his
wishes
are
carried
out.
but,
it
seems
to
me,
that
the
responsibility
is
broader
than
that.
the
responsibility
is
to
not
do
the
very
least
but
to
do
very
most
to
assure
that
the
ballot
is
secret
for
everyone.
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
and,
i
think
it's
in
that
respect
that
virginia
has
failed.
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
i'm
not
even
--
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
that's
not
entirely
sure,
and
i
do
know
that
there
is
an
applic
--
that
that
is
what
they
claim
in
this
case,
but
the
claim
is
as
a
consequence
of
the
statute
that's
under
attack
and
the
additional
argument
in
our
brief,
of
course,
is
--
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
well,
they've
raised
the
attorney
general's
opinion,
whatever
effect
that
has,
the
virginia
statute
that
we're
challenging
is
one
that,
obviously,
was
suspended
by
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965
and
the
--
and
they
so
indicate.
so
that,
i'm
not
entirely
sure
that
it's
correct
to
state
that
virginia
has
prohibited
the
use
of
stickers,
but
i
--
but,
if
you
recall,
i
did
not
cast
the
issue
in
those
--
in
that
narrow
focus.
what
--
what
the
submission
is
that
the
court
is
being
asked
to
fix
on
the
question
of
whether
virginia,
consistent
with
the
equal
protection
clause,
has
fulfilled
its
responsibility
to
make
sure
that
these
illiterates
have
the
right
to
a
secret
ballot
and
also
have
the
right
to
somehow
be
asserting
that
when
they
cast
that
vote,
where
the
list
for
--
whether
for
a
listed
candidate
or
for
a
write-in
candidate,
that
that
vote
will
be
effective
because
this
is
the
thing
that
was
very,
very
uppermost
in
the
minds
of
the
person
--
of
the
appellants
here.
i
have
about
three
minutes
which
i'd
like
to
reserve
for
rebuttal.
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
with
my
few
remaining
minutes,
the
only
response
to
this
most
recent
revelation
is
that
the
bulletin
--
the
change
in
the
bulletin
is
one
which,
obviously,
was
a
time
to
anticipate,
apparently,
the
presentation
of
the
case
here
and
there's
nothing
which,
apparently,
bars
virginia
from
changing
the
statute
or
changing
the
bulletin
as
it
--
to
its
form
or
way.
the
election
bulletin
is,
after
all,
only
a
regulation
by
the
election
officials.
there
is
just
one
small
misstatement
of
fact
that
i'd
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to,
and
that
is
that,
in
one
of
the
cases
cited
by
mr.
mcilwaine
in
which
the
district
court
to
require
that
assistance
be
given
to
illiterates,
morris
v.
fortson,
it
was
clear
that
the
assistance
could
be
given
by
persons
other
than
state
election
officials.
the
point
with
respect
to
the
memorandum
by
the
solicitor
general
raising
the
section
5
question
seems
to
me
to
be
resolved
in
this
fashion,
that
assuming
the
regulation
had
been
submitted
to
the
attorney
general
and
the
attorney
general
had
approved
it,
we
would
have
this
case.
assuming
that
he
had
rejected
the
memorandum,
you
would
have
a
situation
where,
as
everyone
agrees,
section
24-252
was
suspended.
and
therefore,
you
would
have
precisely
the
same
questions
that
are
presented
on
this
record.
that
is,
in
light
of
that
fact
situation,
whether
the
right
to
a
secret
ballot
could
be
preserved
by
some
means
and
whether
the
means
actually
adopted
in
this
case
was
a
reasonable
means
to
achieve
that
end.
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
on
appeal
here
from
a
three-judge
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
virginia
presents
two
issues
of
first
impression
in
this
court:
one
constitutional,
the
other
statutory.
respecting
the
right
of
illiterates
who,
as
a
consequence
of
the
passage
of
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965,
became
eligible
to
vote
for
the
first
time
in
virginia
and
elsewhere
to
cast
a
secret
ballot
for
the
candidate
of
their
choice
and
to
have
that
ballot
counted
for
their
candidate
just
as
every
other
qualified
voter
in
the
state
of
virginia.
that
constitutional
question
is
whether
these
illiterates
who,
by
the
last
census,
were
more
than
3%
of
the
persons
in
virginia
over
14
years
of
age,
can,
consistent
with
the
fourteenth
amendment,
be
barred,
via
equal
protection
clause
of
that
amendment,
be
barred
from
protecting
their
right
to
a
secret
ballot
by
use
of
a
gum
sticker
bearing
the
name
of
the
candidate
of
their
choice.
in
face
of
a
virginia
statute
requiring
that
any
write-in
vote
be
in
the
voter's
own
handwriting,
the
statutory
issue
is
whether
the
handwriting
provision
of
this
statute
which
is
virginia
code
section
24-252,
the
text
of
which
is
at
page
2
of
our
brief
and
at
page
68
(a)
of
the
appendix,
is
a
test
or
device
prohibited
by
subsection
4
(a)
of
the
voting
rights
act,
the
complete
text
of
that
section
is
at
page
5
--
begins
at
page
5
of
our
brief.
our
contention
on
the
constitutional
issue
is
that
the
equal
protection
clause
is
violated,
because
illiterates
who
want
to
cast
a
write-in
vote
without
disclosing
the
nature
of
that
vote
to
state
officials
are
prevented
from
doing
so,
while
virginia
has
provided
for
the
protection
of
the
secrecy
of
the
ballot
for
other
classes
of
voters.
on
the
voting
rights
act
issue,
we
assert
the
refusal
to
count
the
illiterate's
write-in
ballots,
which
is
what
occurred
here,
as
a
denial
of
the
right
to
vote,
as
defined
in
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965,
by
using
a
prohibited
test
or
device.
now,
at
the
threshold,
because
this
court
postponed
decision
as
to
jurisdiction,
is
the
question
of
the
court's
jurisdiction
to
decide
these
issues
on
this
appeal?
the
appeal,
of
course,
is
based
on
28
u.s.c.
section
1253,
in
that
the
appeal
is
from
an
order
denying
a
permanent
injunction
in
a
civil
action
required
to
be
heard
and
determined
by
a
district
court
of
three
judges.
the
argument
that
the
case
is
one
that
is
required
to
be
heard
by
a
three-judge
court
is
of
course
based
on
28
u.s.c.
section
2281.
the
argument
is
in
our
brief
beginning
at
pages
23.
in
sum,
it
is
as
follows:
first,
that
28
u.s.c.
section
2281
requires
a
three-judge
court
to
hear
a
case
seeking
an
injunction
against
the
enforcement
of
a
state
statute
on
the
ground
of
its
unconstitutionality.
that
is
the
claim
that
appellants
presented
to
the
district
court
here.
second,
the
complaint
met
the
formal
requirements
for
invoking
the
three-judge
court
jurisdiction.
the
single
district
judge
who
received
the
application
for
the
three-judge
court
acted
routinely
on
the
application
and,
indeed,
the
three-judge
court
itself
never
raised
any
question
as
to
its
jurisdiction
and
proceeded
to
decide
the
case
on
the
merits
of
both
the
constitutional
and
the
statutory
issue.
fourth,
the
appellees
never
raised
any
question
as
to
jurisdiction
in
the
district
court,
and
i
do
not
understand
their
brief
in
this
court
to
be
raising
any
question
as
to
jurisdiction
now.
fifth,
certainly,
the
constitutional
question
is
a
substantial
one.
it's
one
of
first
impression
and,
consequently,
it
has
not
been
foreclosed
by
any
prior
decisions
of
this
court,
and
the
inclusion
of
the
statutory
claim
under
the
voting
rights
act
did
not
operate
to
divest
the
three-judge
court
of
the
jurisdiction
that
it
acquired
as
a
consequence
of
appellant's
constitutional
claim.
and
finally,
what
is
obvious,
virginia
code
section
24-252
is
a
statute
of
statewide
applicability
in
virginia,
and
so
there
is
no
question
of
dealing
with
a
statute
only
local
in
application.
we
also
joined
in
our
brief
and
arguments,
beginning
at
page
28,
an
alternate
jurisdictional
ground
under
subsection
4
(a)
of
the
voting
rights
act,
but
it
seems
that
the
constitutional
basis
for
the
jurisdiction
of
the
three-judge
court
is
sufficient
and,
with
the
court's
permission,
i'd
just
like
to
pass
on
to
the
merits.
now,
turning
to
the
merits,
i
think
it's
important
to
state
a
couple
of
propositions.
first,
the
court
is
not
being
asked
to
rule
on
the
question
of
whether
the
fourteenth
amendment
prevents
a
state
from
barring
the
use
of
stickers
by
all
segments
of
the
electorate
at
any
time.
now,
to
the
extent
that
the
state
courts,
a
handful
of
them,
themselves
have
dealt
with
that
question,
the
majority
view
has
upheld
the
right
to
use
stickers
and
those
cases
are
cited
both
in
our
brief
and
in
the
brief
of
the
appellees.
nor
is
the
court
being
asked
to
deal
with
a
question
of
whether
virginia
had
the
right
to
set
a
voter
qualification
because
the
effect
of
the
voting
rights
act
on
this
proceeding
was
to
enfranchise
illiterates.
so,
the
real
question
before
this
court
is
one
of
the
state's
responsibilities
toward
illiterates
who
are
qualified
voters
with
respect
to
two
areas.
first,
the
preservation
of
the
secrecy
of
their
ballot
and,
second,
with
respect
to
the
assurance,
the
certainty
to
them
that
the
ballot
will
be
counted
for
the
candidate
of
their
choice,
thus,
preserving
their
right
to
choose.
now,
these
issues
arise
out
of
the
following
circumstances.
samuel
tucker,
a
well-known
negro
civil
rights
lawyer
was
running
as
a
write-in
candidate
for
congress
in
the
last
congressional
election
in
1966
from
virginia's
fourth
congressional
district.
now,
the
fourth
congressional
district
of
virginia
is
in
an
area
that's
commonly
called
southside
virginia,
and
it
is
an
area
in
which
there
exists
the
largest
black
population
in
the
state
and
also
the
largest
percentage
of
the
state's
illiterates.
the
last
census
indicated
that
persons
over
14
years
of
age
in
that
district,
approximately
94,000,
were
persons
who
were
illiterate
and
--
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
i'm
sorry.
the
figure
i
gave
you,
mr.
justice
stewart,
was
for
the
state
of
virginia
at
large.
the
state
as
a
whole
had
--
in
the
fourth
congressional
district
had
22.9%
of
persons
over
25
years
of
age.
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
now,
on
the
ballot
were
listed
two
white
candidates,
the
incumbent,
mr.
watkins
abbott
who
had
been,
to
that
point,
serving
in
the
congress
for
20
years
since
the
80th
congress,
and
his
opponent,
the
republican
candidate,
mr.
silva.
now,
mr.
tucker,
who
had
run
in
the
previous
congressional
election
and
who
was
then
listed
on
the
ballot,
did
not
qualify
in
time
for
his
name
to
be
listed
on
the
ballot
in
this
election
and
he
was
later
urged
to
run
as
a
write-in
candidate
by
his
supporters
who
were
in
the
main
negroes
who
wanted
no
part
of
either
candidate
who
was
listed
on
the
ballot.
now,
they
sought
to
maximize
the
vote
for
tucker
by
inclusion
of
this
relatively
substantial
number
of
newly
enfranchised
illiterates
who,
as
the
district
court
found,
were,
and
i
think
this
language
is
of
some
significance,
were
registered
voters
but
who
were
unable
to
spell
accurately
or
to
write
legibly.
now,
as
the
court
found,
just
to
consider
the
choices
that
confronted
the
persons
in
these
situations,
it
seems
to
be
there
were
three.
one,
of
course,
was
not
to
vote
at
all.
second,
of
course,
was
to
vote
for
someone
whose
name
was
on
the
ballot
that
they
didn't
want.
and,
third,
was
to
disclose
their
vote
to
white
state
election
officials
who,
pursuant
to
virginia
law,
are
appointees
of
the
dominant
political
parties
in
the
state
in
an
area
like
southside
virginia,
an
area
which
includes
prince
edward
county
which
is
familiar
to
this
court
from
prior
litigation,
an
area
in
which
they
could
anticipate
the
kinds
of
things
that
the
civil
rights
commission
reports
has
highlighted
and,
indeed,
the
kinds
of
things
that
were
the
--
resulted
in
the
passage
of
the
voting
rights
act
in
the
first
place.
so,
to
solve
the
dual
problem
of
being
able
to
exercise
a
choice
but,
at
the
same
time,
trying
to
keep
that
choice
hidden
from
the
dominant
white
political
apparatus
which
had
opposed
for
decades
the
participation
of
black
members
of
the
electorate,
they
used
what
to
them
was
a
very
simple
means
of
having
printed
gum
stickers,
just
the
form
that
i'm
demonstrating
here
where
this
is
plaintiff's
exhibit
1,
it's
in
the
record,
which
simply
said
s.w.
tucker.
the
point
being
that
the
illiterate
person,
when
he
went
to
the
polls,
could
simply
tape,
stick,
put
that
on
the
ballot,
fold
his
ballot
and,
in
accordance
with
the
virginia
procedure,
hand
it
to
the
election
official
for
deposit
in
the
ballot
box.
now,
the
proposition
that's
urged
by
virginia
is
that
the
use
of
stickers
is
per
se
invalid
and
apparently,
in
reading
the
district
court's
opinion,
that
court
thought
that
this
was
a
central
issue
in
the
case
and
that
the
virginia
legislature
had
forbidden
their
use
in
total.
but,
i
think
this,
of
course,
misses
the
point
which
is
that
once
these
persons
were
enfranchised
by
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965,
it
became
the
virginia's
responsibility
to
provide
some
means
for
assuring
the
secrecy
and
the
certainty
of
the
ballot
among
all
its
qualified
voters.
and,
in
fact,
virginia
has,
and
prior
to
the
1965
voting
rights
act,
made
accommodations
with
respect
to
these
qualities
with
respect
to
other
classes
of
voters.
virginia's
constitution
itself
guarantees
the
right
of
secrecy
of
the
ballot
and
there
are
several
other
provisions
in
the
state's
code,
all
of
which
fixed
on
the
importance
of
keeping
the
ballot's
secret,
but
virginia
has
not
done
this
in
the
case
of
these
illiterates.
rather,
among
all
the
voters
who
are
qualified,
it
has
set
up
classes
of
voters
and
discriminated
among
them
both
with
respect
to
the
question
of
the
secrecy
of
the
ballot,
with
respect
to
the
assurance
to
the
voter
that
his
vote
will
in
fact
be
counted
for
the
candidate
of
his
choice
and
in
an
additional
respect
too,
particularly
as
regard
to
illiterates.
virginia
has
made
it
easier
for
the
illiterate
to
vote
for
a
candidate
whose
name
is
listed
on
the
ballot
but
it
has
made
it
--
it
is
discriminated
with
respect
to
an
illiterate
who
chooses
to
vote
for
a
candidate
who's
running
a
write-in
campaign.
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
no,
that's
not
entirely
right,
mr.
justice
fortas.
first
of
all,
there
is
nothing
incumbent
in
the
statute
which
does
that.
what
you
have
reference
to
is
in
a
vote-in
which
was
sent
by
the
secretary
of
the
state
board
of
elections
to
all
the
judges
of
election
in
october
of
1965.
it's
plaintiff's
--
it's
defendant's
exhibit
4
on
page
--
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
that's
the
point.
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
that's
correct.
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
the
--
now
--
so,
the
question
is
what
about
the
illiterates
who
desire
to
cast
write-in
votes,
as
did
the
appellants
here,
and
when
it's
obvious
that
the
--
there,
under
the
state's
own
categories
that
they
set
up
for
protecting
the
secrecy
of
the
vote,
are
the
least-favored
class.
let's
just
see
what
these
differences
are
with
respect
to
each
of
the
three
things
which
i
think
are
extremely
important
here,
the
question
of
secrecy,
the
question
of
what
i
call
certainty
or
the
surety
that
the
vote
will
in
fact
be
cast
for
the
person
that
the
person
intends
it
to
be
cast
for,
and
with
respect
to
the
difficulty
between
voting
a
listed
as
opposed
--
voting
for
a
listed
candidate
as
opposed
to
voting
for
a
write-in
candidate.
now,
of
course,
the
literate
voter
is
fully
protected
on
all
of
these
scores.
whether
it's
a
voting
machine
or
whether
it's
a
ballot
box,
he
can
vote
in
absolute
secrecy.
he
can,
himself,
assure
that
his
vote
is
cast
for
the
candidate
of
his
choice
and
there
is
no
discernable
problem
between
voting
for
a
candidate
whose
name
is
on
the
ballot
as
oppose
to
writing
in
a
name,
except
the
small
amount
of
inconvenience
that
it
takes
to
write
the
name.
now,
the
statute
that
mr.
justice
fortas
referred
to,
24
section
251,
it's
reproduced
in
our
brief
at
page
3,
sets
up
other
categories
for
voters
who,
in
some
sense,
have
to
be
--
had
to
be
singled
out
for
special
treatment,
and
let's
see
what
virginia
has
done
with
them.
first,
there's
a
category
of
a
blind
voter.
now,
obviously,
because
the
blind
voter
is
under
a
special
disability,
virginia
has
taken
some
steps
to
assure
the
capacity
for
him
to
make
his
vote
effective
in
all
these
ways
that
i've
indicated.
but,
what
it
has
done
is
to
say
that
the
blind
voter
can
be
assisted
in
casting
his
vote
either
a
write-in
or
voting
for
someone
who's
listed
by
a
person
who
--
of
his
selection.
that
person,
of
course,
can
be
a
trusted
friend.
it's
done
one
additional
thing
which
it
hasn't
done
in
the
case
of
the
illiterates.
it
has
provided
criminal
sanctions
to
enforce
the
right
of
the
blind
voter
to
secrecy,
the
right
of
the
blind
voter
to
make
sure
that
his
ballot
is
in
fact
cast
for
the
person
that
he
intended
it
to.
now,
the
physically
handicapped
voter
is
one
who
can
be
assisted
only
by
an
election
judge
which
he
can
designate,
and
there
are
criminal
sanctions
as
in
the
case
of
a
blind
voter,
but
what
the
physically
handicapped
voter
has
to
do
then,
even
though
he's
protected
with
respect
to
being,
himself,
physically
able
to
see
how
his
vote
is
cast
so
that
he
can
himself
determine
whether
in
fact
the
vote
is
being
cast
for
the
person
that
he
intend
it,
he
has
to
give
up
some
measure
of
his
secrecy
but,
again,
there
is
a
sanction.
the
same
applies
to
that
small,
right
now
it's
a
very
small,
category
of
persons
who
were
born
before
1904,
persons
who
would
be
over
80
years
of
age,
persons
who
are
rather
registered
before
1904,
but
the
illiterate,
under
virginia
law
as
it
presently
stands,
must
sac
--
for
a
sacrifice
of
his
secrecy
to
a
state
official,
if
he
chooses
to
vote
in
accordance
with
the
election
bulletin,
there
is
no
criminal
sanction
to
enforce
the
--
his
right
of
secrecy
as
opposed
to
the
state
election
official.
he
has
no
assurance
both
because
he's
very
much
like
the
blind
voter,
he
can't
really
see
how
the
ballot's
being
marked
and
because
there
is
no
criminal
sanction,
he
has
no
real
assurance
that
the
vote
is
going
to
be
cast
for
the
candidate
that
he
intends
it
to
be
cast
for.
and,
he
suffers
also
a
substantial
discrimination
with
respect
to
his
capacity
to
vote
for
a
write-in
candidate
as
opposed
to
a
listed
candidate.
now,
what
we've
called
in
our
brief,
this
“crazy
quilt
of
classification”
has
been
condemned
by
this
court
in
a
variety
of
other
context
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
and
we
cited
some
of
those
cases
in
our
brief.
carrington
and
rash,
rinaldi
and
yeager,
the
skinner
v.
oklahoma
dealing
with
the
compulsory
oklahoma
sterilization
law.
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
yes,
i
think
it's
--
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
there's
no
sanction,
and
the
equal
protection
point,
of
course,
is
that,
with
respect
to
the
other
classes
of
voters,
all
of
whom,
like
the
illiterates,
are
qualified,
there
is
--
virginia
has
made
some
attempt.
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
i
know
of
none.
virginia
says
that
the
reason
for
the
issuance
of
the
election
voting,
which
is
clear,
was
the
passage
of
the
voting
rights
act.
virginia
prior
--
as
did
several
other
states,
prior
to
the
passage
of
that,
had
made
no
provisions
for
illiterates
at
all.
it
obviously,
particularly
as
a
consequence
of
this
court's
decision
in
lassiter,
felt
that
it
was
under
no
obligation.
so,
when
the
voting
rights
act
was
passed
in
1965,
virginia,
for
the
first
time,
tried
to
accommodate
itself
to
the
new
requirement
and
this
election
--
electoral
bulletin
is
the
result.
now,
that's
deficient
in
several
respects,
but
the
most
important
respect,
it
seems
to
me,
in
addition
to
the
fact
that
there
is
no
sanction,
is
the
fact
that
even
assuming
the
sanction
the
other
very
important
consideration,
very
important
at
least
in
the
minds
of
the
persons
who
attempted
to
use
the
stickers
in
this
election
is
the
fact
that
they
would
nevertheless
have
to
divulge
the
nature
of
their
vote
to
a
state
election
official.
so,
the
electoral
bulletin
really
does
not
need
that
aspect
of
the
problem.
the
--
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
i'm
not
sure
if
it
--
well,
i
think
that's
what
it
attempts
to
do.
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
it
attempts
to
do
that.
i
think
it's
interesting
to
note
that
certain
terms
of
the
last
election
that
nobody
who
voted
at
that
time
knew
anything
about
this.
this
bulletin,
the
first
time
anybody
heard
about
it
was
when
it's
introduced
in
--
when
it
was
raised
in
a
brief
that
was
filed
in
the
district
court
in
response
to
a
motion
of
summary
judgment.
the
--
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
but
the
--
yes,
the
election
was
two
years
ago,
but
the
bulletin
had
been
issued
in
october
of
the
previous
year,
a
couple
of
months
after
the
passage
of
the
voting
rights
act.
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
no,
i
don't
think
that's
the
answer
in
so
far
as
you
have
to
give
up
a
very
substantial
com
--
part
of
your
secrecy
to
a
votes
--
to
a
voting
official.
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
well,
but
--
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
well,
i
think
that
the
closest
approximation,
mr.
justice
stewart,
if
you
want
to
make
one,
is
to
the
persons
who
are
blind.
but,
if
that
--
but
because
the
illiterate,
like
the
blind
person,
is
incapable
of
really
seeing
the
ballot
in
terms
of
making
sure
that
his
wishes
are
carried
out.
but,
it
seems
to
me,
that
the
responsibility
is
broader
than
that.
the
responsibility
is
to
not
do
the
very
least
but
to
do
very
most
to
assure
that
the
ballot
is
secret
for
everyone.
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
and,
i
think
it's
in
that
respect
that
virginia
has
failed.
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
i'm
not
even
--
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
that's
not
entirely
sure,
and
i
do
know
that
there
is
an
applic
--
that
that
is
what
they
claim
in
this
case,
but
the
claim
is
as
a
consequence
of
the
statute
that's
under
attack
and
the
additional
argument
in
our
brief,
of
course,
is
--
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
well,
they've
raised
the
attorney
general's
opinion,
whatever
effect
that
has,
the
virginia
statute
that
we're
challenging
is
one
that,
obviously,
was
suspended
by
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965
and
the
--
and
they
so
indicate.
so
that,
i'm
not
entirely
sure
that
it's
correct
to
state
that
virginia
has
prohibited
the
use
of
stickers,
but
i
--
but,
if
you
recall,
i
did
not
cast
the
issue
in
those
--
in
that
narrow
focus.
what
--
what
the
submission
is
that
the
court
is
being
asked
to
fix
on
the
question
of
whether
virginia,
consistent
with
the
equal
protection
clause,
has
fulfilled
its
responsibility
to
make
sure
that
these
illiterates
have
the
right
to
a
secret
ballot
and
also
have
the
right
to
somehow
be
asserting
that
when
they
cast
that
vote,
where
the
list
for
--
whether
for
a
listed
candidate
or
for
a
write-in
candidate,
that
that
vote
will
be
effective
because
this
is
the
thing
that
was
very,
very
uppermost
in
the
minds
of
the
person
--
of
the
appellants
here.
i
have
about
three
minutes
which
i'd
like
to
reserve
for
rebuttal.
mr.
norman
c.
amaker
with
my
few
remaining
minutes,
the
only
response
to
this
most
recent
revelation
is
that
the
bulletin
--
the
change
in
the
bulletin
is
one
which,
obviously,
was
a
time
to
anticipate,
apparently,
the
presentation
of
the
case
here
and
there's
nothing
which,
apparently,
bars
virginia
from
changing
the
statute
or
changing
the
bulletin
as
it
--
to
its
form
or
way.
the
election
bulletin
is,
after
all,
only
a
regulation
by
the
election
officials.
there
is
just
one
small
misstatement
of
fact
that
i'd
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to,
and
that
is
that,
in
one
of
the
cases
cited
by
mr.
mcilwaine
in
which
the
district
court
to
require
that
assistance
be
given
to
illiterates,
morris
v.
fortson,
it
was
clear
that
the
assistance
could
be
given
by
persons
other
than
state
election
officials.
the
point
with
respect
to
the
memorandum
by
the
solicitor
general
raising
the
section
5
question
seems
to
me
to
be
resolved
in
this
fashion,
that
assuming
the
regulation
had
been
submitted
to
the
attorney
general
and
the
attorney
general
had
approved
it,
we
would
have
this
case.
assuming
that
he
had
rejected
the
memorandum,
you
would
have
a
situation
where,
as
everyone
agrees,
section
24-252
was
suspended.
and
therefore,
you
would
have
precisely
the
same
questions
that
are
presented
on
this
record.
that
is,
in
light
of
that
fact
situation,
whether
the
right
to
a
secret
ballot
could
be
preserved
by
some
means
and
whether
the
means
actually
adopted
in
this
case
was
a
reasonable
means
to
achieve
that
end.
