mr.
william
a.allain
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we
are
a
little
bit
concerned
ourselves
about
the
type
of
relief
which
the
appellants
seem
to
want
in
the
court
today.
we
are
on
the
impression,
at
first,
they
want
to
set
aside
the
elections
which
were
held
in
november
and
have
new
elections.
in
view
of
the
position
they
have
taken
today,
we
feel
that
maybe
one
of
the
most
important
questions
before
the
court
is
whether
or
not
this
issue
is
moot,
whether
or
not
the
submission
by
this
court
to
the
attorney
general
and
then
the
submission
by
us
in
our
response
brief
to
their
brief,
gave
them
the
information,
gave
them
the
notice
that
is
required
by
section
5
of
the
1965
voting
rights
act.
now,
we
say
it
is.
we
know
of
no
formal
submission
that
has
to
be
made
to
the
attorney
general's
office.
mr.
william
a.allain
no,
sir.
i
think
there's
nothing
in
the
briefs.
in
fact,
he
states
in
his
brief
there
that
he
is
reserving
onto
himself
the
right
to
approve
or
disapprove
at
a
later
date.
we
say
to
that
que
--
to
that
assertion,
he
cannot
reserve
onto
himself
longer
than
the
60
days
which
congress
itself
has
placed
in
the
act
is
the
time
in
which
he
must
make
some
kind
of
determination.
now,
he
speaks
of
a
formal
right.
i
know
of
no
directive
that
the
attorney
general's
office
is
put
out
on
how
we
shall
submit
to
the
attorney
general
our
new
laws.
and,
just
because
--
mr.
william
a.allain
while
the
other
states
have
submitted
them
in
one
matter
or
the
other
is
not
binding
upon
the
state
of
mississippi
nor
is
it
controlling
as
to
the
--
what
congress
really
intended
to
do
in
section
5.
mr.
william
a.allain
no,
your
honor,
it
could
be
moot
if
they
have
withdrawn
their
request
for
the
relief
which
they
have
passed
upon.
it
was
my
understanding
the
position
taken
by
counsel
opposite,
counsel
for
the
appellant
and
not
the
amicus
in
this
case,
that
as
far
as
they
were
concerned,
what
they
were
really
asking
for
was
for
this
court
to
tell
mississippi
to
submit
this
to
the
attorney
general's
office
and
let
him
approve
or
disapprove.
now,
we
say
this
court
cannot
command
nor
direct
the
state
of
mississippi
to
do
something
which
is
beyond
the
scope
of
the
act
itself.
we
say,
at
this
late
date,
that
this
has
already
been
done,
exactly
what
appellants
want.
it
has
been
submitted
to
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states.
he
has
not
exercised
his
prerogative
within
the
60
days.
mr.
william
a.allain
that's
true,
your
honor.
mr.
william
a.allain
at
that
time,
what
--
mr.
william
a.allain
when
we
submitted
our
response
to
their
brief,
at
that
time,
we
put
them
on
notice
through
the
attorney
general's
office.
mr.
william
a.allain
that's
true,
your
honor,
and
i
do
not
know
what
the
statute
really
means
by
submit.
does
it
mean
by
telephone
conversation?
does
it
mean
by
any
brief?
does
it
mean
by
passing
on
the
street
if
we
met
the
attorney
general
and
say
"we've
got
a
new
law
in
mississippi"?
mr.
william
a.allain
yes,
your
honor,
it
has.
mr.
william
a.allain
we
have
submitted,
your
honor,
in
our
brief.
he
has
been
put
on
notice
--
mr.
william
a.allain
as
required.
that
is
the
only
submission
that
we
have
made.
your
honor,
let
me
refer
you
to
one
thing
that
did
happen,
and
this
is
a
submission
or
at
least
the
attorney
general
office
accepted
as
such,
we
passed
a
constitutional
amendment
in
which
we
have
lowered
the
residence
statute
of
mississippi
from
two
years
to
one
year.
they
sent
registrars
into
the
state
of
mississippi
just
recently
here
to
register
individuals
under
the
act.
i
was
sitting
at
my
desk
one
day.
a
telephone
call
comes
in
for
mr.
bob
moore
of
the
justice
department
asking
me,
he
said,
"we
have
known
through
the
paper
or
otherwise
that
this
constitutional
amendment
had
been
approved."
we
have
never
submitted
it.
he
says
"is
that
true?"
i
said,
"yes."
he
says
"is
it
in
the
constitution?"
i
said
"yes."
he
said
"we
will
not
notify
the
federal
registrars
to
use
that
as
a
qualification."
that
is
submission.
that
is
approval.
now,
your
honor,
i
don't
know
any
formality.
i
don't
see
how
the
attorney
general's
office
can
stand
here
today
and
say
there's
some
formality
when
they
have
acquiesce
in
a
change
which
came
about
after
november
1,
1964,
when
i
have
submitted
it
over
a
telephone
conversation
and
they,
through
their
officials
and
agents,
have
put
it
into
effect.
that,
your
honor,
we
think
is
--
actually,
section
5
is
more
of
an
informal
thing
and
it
must
be
tied
in
to
whether
or
not
a
private
suite
can
be
brought.
we
think,
actually,
the
legislative
history
shown
from
the
--
as
we
quote
in
our
brief,
the
attorney
general
just
didn't
want
to
have
to
roam
over
the
southern
states.
mr.
william
a.allain
that's
true,
your
honor.
i
say
--
mr.
william
a.allain
at
the
threshold,
if
that
was
decided
as
a
mooted
question,
you
would
not
even
have
to
reach
these
other
questions
which
been
brought
closer.
mr.
william
a.allain
yes,
your
honor,
we
could
say
that
because
if
it
had
been
a
mooted
question
we
would
have
no
case
of
controversy
here
because
the
relief
in
question
have
already,
or
so
i
think
have,
been
withdrawn
as
far
as
the
appellants
are
concerned
with.
the
problem
is
in
--
mr.
william
a.allain
no,
your
honor,
but,
as
this
court
--
mr.
william
a.allain
what
we're
saying,
your
honor,
is
this.
we
do
not
--
mr.
william
a.allain
we
can't
submit
--
mr.
william
a.allain
no,
your
honor.
mr.
william
a.allain
but
we
do
not
believe
we
had
to
submit
it,
but
it
was
submitted
and,
therefore,
is
a
mooted
issue
and
there's
nothing
left
for
this
court
to
decide.
mr.
william
a.allain
through
the
clerk
and
also,
your
honor,
through
our
response
brief
which
brought
attention
to
the
attorney
general
informally
or,
in
this
case,
very
formally
in
writing
that
we
had
such
a
law.
he
had
60
days
and
he
has
done
nothing
about
it.
mr.
william
a.allain
mr.
chief
justice,
i
do
not
intend
to
delay
the
point
any
longer,
your
honors,
in
regard
to
the
mootness
question,
though
we
do
feel
it
in
a
very
serious
question
in
this
case,
but
i
would
like
to
refer
the
court
to
our
brief
in
which
we
have
quoted
from
the
memorandum
submitted
to
the
attorney
general
in
this
particular
case.
"since
section
5's
approval
procedure
was
devi
--
designed
to
serve
an
informing
function
to
provide
a
method
of
bringing
to
the
attention
of
the
government
changes
in
state
law,"
we
again
submit
that
this
was
merely
to
keep
the
attorney
general
from
roaming
all
over
the
southern
states
affected
by
1965
voting
rights
act
and
trying
to
find
out
every
time
when
a
new
law
in
regard
to
voting
was
put
into
effect
in
these
states.
it
was
merely
--
mr.
william
a.allain
page
15,
your
honor,
of
our
brief,
brief
of
the
appellees,
page
15.
mr.
william
a.allain
that's
in
the
25,
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
a.allain
which
means,
that
we
seriously
urge
the
court
that
the
informing
that
the
attorney
general
received
in
this
case
was
sufficient
by
the
legislative
history,
by
the
intent
of
congress,
by
the
interpretation
placed
upon
that
section
by
the
attorney
general's
office
themselves,
that
there
was
no
need
for
any
formal
type
of
notice
given
to
the
attorney
general's
office.
we
would
further
direct
the
court's
attention
or
invite
the
court's
attention
to
page
22
of
the
memorandum
of
the
united
states
as
amicus.
in
which
--
in
this
particular
brief
and
on
page
22
thereof,
they
admit
or
seem
to
admit
that
the
section
5
applies
to
reapportionment
or
to
redistricting,
what
we
have
in
this
particular
case
before
the
court
today,
and
then
they
say,
"the
most
that
can
be
assumed
from
past
silence
is
that
the
attorney
general
was
not
prepared
to
impose
an
objection
to
the
changes
being
at
--
effective
and,
thus,
declined
to
seek
to
compel
a
state
or
political
subdivision
to
comply
with
what
would
have,
in
all
likelihood,
been
a
wholly
formalistic
step
that
would
merely
have
delayed
final
implementation
of
a
constitutional
required
restruction
of
government."
they
are
admitting
there
that,
as
far
as
they're
concerned,
there
may
be
other
areas
in
which
there
has
been
a
restruction
of
government
and
they
did
not
feel
that
they
should
make
them
take
the
formalistic
step.
now,
this,
your
honor,
does
not
tie
in
or
does
not
fit
in
with
mr.
justice
brennan's
remarks
and
i
think
mr.
justice
white's
remarks
that
it
is
not
for
the
attorney
general
to
make
that
decision
whether
or
not
they're
going
to
be
suspended.
if
they
are
suspended,
they
are
suspended
until,
if
they
come
within
the
purview
of
section
5,
the
attorney
there
submitted
to
the
attorney
general's
office
and
approve
or
disapprove
then
that
is
appeal
to
the
washington,,
d.c.
court.
what
they're
saying
here
is
that
there
might
be
other
areas
throughout
the
south
land,
but
we
did
not
feel
that
we
ought
to
take
any
step
to
make
them
do
that.
well,
if
you're
going
to
be
consistent
and
say
that
section
5
says
that
the
act
suspends
these,
what
he
is
saying
is
that
we've
got
laws
out
there
that
are
being
suspended.
we
know
they're
being
enforced,
but
we
will
not
do
our
duty
under
section
12
(d)
of
the
act
of
sec
--
in
section
12
which
says
that
the
attorney
general
can
bring
an
injunction
proceeding
to
keep
those
states
from
doing
what
section
5
says
they
cannot
do.
mr.
william
a.allain
i
would
take
that
position,
mr.
justice
white,
because
we
take
the
position
that
they
do
not
come
under
the
1965
voting
rights
act.
if
the
--
this
court
was
to
hold
or
if
the
position
was
taken
as
appellants
apparently
take
it
that
it
does
come
on
the
1965
voting
rights
act,
then
they
could
not
challenge
it
in
a
local
district
court
bec
--
mr.
william
a.allain
yes,
your
honor.
excuse
me.
i
misunderstood
your
question.
mr.
william
a.allain
if
--
mr.
william
a.allain
if
that
is
correct,
then
they
do
have,
and
we
submit
in
our
brief,
your
honor,
that
they
have
that
right,
then
they
had
the
right
on
the
local
level
to
bring
a
suit
under
the
fifteenth
amendment
which
is
what
they
--
and
let
me
--
i'd
like
to
clear
this
up
in
the
marshall
case
and
in
the
fairley
case
which
is
the
appellant
supervisors.
we
do
not
have,
in
that
case,
a
fifteenth
or
a
fourteenth
amendment
question.
that
was
taken
out
not
by
stipulation,
as
in
the
other
two
cases.
that
was
taken
out
by
a
petition
or
a
motion
filed
on
the
part
of
the
appellants,
an
order
granting
that
that
second
claim
of
the
f
--
be
taken
out
of
the
lawsuit
entirely.
so,
we
stand
before
the
court
today
resting
entirely
upon
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court
and
the
three-judge
district
court
in
the
trial
of
the
district
court
--
mr.
william
a.allain
upon
the
act
in
it
of
itself.
mr.
william
a.allain
your
honor,
i
would
think
--
mr.
william
a.allain
no,
your
honor.
i
think
it
would
be
more
of
the
fact
that
they
did
not
take
any
action
is,
more
or
less,
an
approval
of
it.
and,
congress
intended
it
to
be,
more
or
less,
retroactive.
mr.
william
a.allain
that
if
they
would
become
effective
after
that
date
--
mr.
william
a.allain
right,
sir.
mr.
william
a.allain
to
my
knowledge,
he
had
not,
sir.
mr.
william
a.allain
my
feeling
in
it,
your
honor,
would
be
that
if
a
law
was
passed
or
put
into
effect
and
it
was
submitted
to
him
and
he
has
the
60
days,
that
even
if
he
did
not
act
within
that
time
or
he
approved
it,
that
it
would
be
more
or
less
retroactive
and
it
would
become
effective
as
of
the
time
in
which
it
was
put
into
effect.
mr.
william
a.allain
to
my
mootness
argument,
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
william
a.allain
right.
mr.
william
a.allain
no,
sir.
mr.
william
a.allain
according
to
my
position,
it
was
last
term,
your
honor.
first,
when
you
--
when
the
court
had
requested
that
this
--
mr.
william
a.allain
amicus
should
be
filed.
i'm
not
sure
of
the
date,
your
honor,
but
i
do
know
that
it's
--
mr.
william
a.allain
whatever
date
it
is.
mr.
william
a.allain
at
that
time.
mr.
william
a.allain
until
submitted
by
this
court.
mr.
william
a.allain
but,
he's
not
acting
up
on
it,
your
honor.
we
think
congress
intended
it
would
be
retroactive
and
it'd
be
effective
as
of
the
date
in
which
it
was
passed
whether
he
approved
it
or
whether
he
did
not
do
anything
about
it.
we
think
you'd
almost
have
to
read
that
into
the
act
to
keep
the
--
to
keep
it
from
being
in
suspension
in
that
period
of
time
when
nothing
would
be
really
in
effect
or
there'd
be
some
conflict
of
the
law.
your
honor,
we
would
like
to
say
this
in
moot
--
excuse
me
sir?
mr.
william
a.allain
your
honor,
i
think
that
he
would
have
to
have
some
type
of
idea
of
what's
informal
because
i
don't
--
really,
we
may
be
limiting
but
some
manner
from
an
official
of
the
state
of
mississippi.
now,
as
i
illustrated,
the
one
in
which
the
government
accepted
was
a
telephone
conversation,
but
it
did
come
from
an
assistant
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
mississippi
to
a
justice
department
attorney.
i
was
being
somewhat
facetious
when
i
told
mr.
justice
marshall
about,
on
a
street
corner
or
something,
there
would
be
no
documented
evidence
of
it
or
there
would
not
be
an
official
of
one
of
the
state
and
an
official
of
the
federal
government.
i'm
not
sure
if
the
chief
justice
is
speaking
of
some
formality
of
some
writing,
some
correspondent,
some
letter,
or
just
what
we
have
here.
mr.
william
a.allain
if
the
court
please,
they
have
accepted
it
apparently
in
that
manner,
and
i
will
place
the
instruction
they've
placed
on
it.
mr.
william
a.allain
i
think
it
should
be,
your
honor.
mr.
william
a.allain
if
the
court
please,
at
this
time,
that
is
really
--
in
other
words,
i
would
rather
limit
it
to
what
happened
in
this
particular
case
which
was
a
formal.
i
would
not
want
to
foreclose
it
as
a
case,
arbitrarily
in
this
term
of
court,
it
might
be
just
around
the
corner,
but
this
court
does
not
have
to
make
that
decision.
this
court
does
not
have
to
go
that
far.
this
court
can
merely
say,
in
this
case,
this
was
a
formal
or
was
all
that
was
necessary
under
section
5.
i
would
hate
to
--
mr.
william
a.allain
right,
sir.
mr.
william
a.allain
right,
sir.
mr.
william
a.allain
right,
sir.
mr.
william
a.allain
i
contend
it
was,
your
honor.
i
contend
that
the
government
contended
that
it
was.
mr.
william
a.allain
i
do
think
so,
your
honor.
i
really
do.
now,
i
would
like
to
say
this.
now,
at
the
outset,
counsel
for
opposite
place
quite
a
bit
of
their
time
and
effort
discussing
ratios
of
negro
to
white
discussing
the
counties,
how
their
makeup
was.
now,
i
would
be
less
than
honest
with
this
court.
if
i
was
to
stand
before
you
and
say
there
is
no
racial
overtones
here,
that
until
i
came
here
today
i
didn't
realize
that
race
was
one
of
the
prime
movers
of
this
particular
lawsuit,
but
i
will
say
this.
before
this
court,
race
is
not
a
question.
as
justice
stewart
said
earlier,
we
only
have
a
question
before
this
court,
first,
of
the
jurisdiction
which
has
been
limited
discussion
over
as
of
this
time
and,
secondly,
whether
or
not
this
act,
i
don't
care
where
it
was,
i
don't
care
if
they
were
all-whites
or
all-negro,
whether
or
not
this
type
of
act
in
the
marshall
and
the
fairley
case,
and
i
would
like
to
limit
my
argument
to
that,
mr.
wells
will
discuss
the
other
cases,
whether
or
not
it
came
within
the
purview
of
the
1965
voting
rights
act.
and,
i
think
i'd
like
to
make
that
clear
because
there
is
no
need
to
discuss
in
this
case
racial,
but
i
would
like
to
say
this
in
regard
to
a
question
posed
by
mr.
justice
fortas.
we
know
that
this
court
decided
in
the
avery
versus
midland
county
texas
case
that
the
rationale
of
the
reynolds
v.sims
goes
down
to
the
local
level,
and
that
was
the
first
time
this
court
had
actually
made
that
pronouncement.
april
11,
1966,
shown
in
appellant
--
appellees'
brief
at
page
15
in
number
25,
now,
let's
get
these
dates,
your
honors,
april
11,
1966,
the
chief
judge
of
the
southern
district
of
mississippi,
judge
harold
cox,
in
the
case
of
crosby
versus
pearl
river
county
in
which
a
suit
was
filed
to
de
--
command
that
--
the
supervisor
to
redistrict,
motion
to
dismiss
was
filed
on
the
grounds
that
the
rationale
of
sims
did
not
--
reynolds
did
not
come
that
far
down.
he
found
that
it
did
in
april
11,
1966,
and
he
directed
pearl
river
county
to
redistrict.
this
act,
other
suits
were
filed.
the
legislature
did
not
pass
this
act
until
may
27,
1966,
having
put
on
notice
that
the
district
courts
of
the
southern
district
of
mississippi
felt
that
the
reapportionment
decision
did
go
down
to
the
county
level.
your
honors
would
have
to
be
familiar
with
some
of
the
counties
of
mississippi
to
realize
we
don't
have
any
debates
in
the
legislature
and
the
legislative
history
which
we
can
bring
before
the
court,
but
many
other
counties
in
mississippi
cannot
be
redistrict
for
the
simple
reason
that
the
population
might
be
grouped
up
in
the
southern
area
or
the
northern
area
like
in
hines
county,
the
jackson
is
grouped
--
the
people
in
jackson
are
grouped
up
in
the
northeastern
section.
so,
the
legislature
felt
that
they
must
do
something,
put
on
notice
by
the
district
court
that
they
were
going
to
apply
this
court's
decision
in
the
reynolds
case
to
allow
these
counties
to
do
something
to
comply
with
it.
there
is
just
an
impossibility
in
many
of
the
mississippi
counties,
i'd
say
in
many
counties
throughout
the
united
states,
to
actually
draw
off
lines,
rational
lines,
and
put
the
population
where
they
would
not
be
within
a
certain
percent
of
the
ratio
in
the
five
districts.
your
honor,
because
of
the
way
that
the
population
is
grouped
up
in
one
area,
and
we
must
not
only
take
in
the
consideration,
i
think
this
court
has
said
we
don't
have
to
take
in
completely
the
population,
you
would
have
all
of
the
county
grouped
up
in
here
and
the
people
down
here
having
very
little
representation.
there
are
a
number
of
people
scattered
throughout
that
area
but
of
different
diverse
types
of
economics,
maybe
farmers
here
and
maybe
blue-collared
workers
here
and,
up
in
this
area,
white-collared
workers
and
your
wealthier
people.
it
has
been
shown
just
by
surveys
through
survey
companies
that
it
is
almost
an
impossibility
in
some
of
the
counties
for
us
to
really
redistrict.
now,
of
course,
this
court,
as
i
read
the
decisions,
have
placed
in
the
virginia
beach
case
its
stamp
of
approval
upon
the
very
thing
which
these
two
counties
had
done,
and
also
made
mention
and,
i
guess,
reapproved
the
virginia
beach
case
in
the
avery
versus
midland
county
texas
case
so,
what
i
was
trying
to
get
before
the
court
that,
irrespective
of
what
counsel
might
thought
was
the
reason
for
doing
this,
there
were
good
concrete
reasons
existing
in
mississippi's
district
courts.
mr.
william
a.allain
that's
true,
sir.
mr.
william
a.allain
your
honor,
because
the
counsel,
i
guess,
spent
so
much
time
on
it,
there
were
quite
a
number
of
questions
from
court
--
mr.
william
a.allain
and
the
bench
in
that
regard.
mr.
william
a.allain
and
i
was
really
merely
asking
--
answering
a
question
posed
by
justice
fortas
when
he
was,
i
think,
he
asked
if
there'd
been
any
commands
by
the
district
courts
or
commands
by
any
courts
to
redistrict.
and,
i
was
answering
that
question
and,
on
july
27,
1966,
a
three-judge
district
court
had
called
upon
one
of
the
counties.
that
was
prowled
of
what
was
done
in
adams
and
in
forrest
counties.
now,
moving
on
from
that
question,
your
honor,
we
come
to
the
question
which
was
actually
raised
or
not
raised
but
urged
by
this
court,
and
that
is
to
the
jurisdictional
question
and
one
in
which
the
government
was
asked
to
file
a
brief.
whether
or
not
this
court
has
jurisdiction
because,
there,
was
a
properly
convened
a
three-judge
district
court
in
mississippi.
now,
we're
all
in
accord,
i
think,
on
this
one
principle.
how
do
you
read
the
last
sentence
of
section
5
of
the
1965
voting
rights
act?
it
is
just
that
simple.
whether
any
action
under
this
section,
and
i'm
quoting
from
page
6
of
our
brief,
any
action
under
this
section
shall
be
heard
and
determined
by
a
court
of
three
judges.
now,
we
say
that
that
sentence
was
merely
referring
to
the
subject
matter
that
is
referred
to
in
section
5.
the
only
subject
matter
referred
to
in
section5,
the
only
action
referred
to
in
section
5
in
the
court
is
a
declaratory
judgment
in
the
district
court
of
washington,,
d.c.
and,
that
is
when
if
first
we
have
submitted
our
new
laws
to
the
attorney
general's
office
and
he
has
refused
to
approve
it
and
then
we
file
our
case
in
the
washington,
d.c.court
or
if
we
wanted
to
bypass
for
some
reason,
i
don't
know
what
reason
we
might
have,
the
attorney
general's
office,
we
proceed
originally
in
the
washington,
d.c.
court.
that
is
the
only
action,
court
action,
with
section
5
or
the
subject
matter
of
section
5
is
concerned
with.
and,
we
say
to
the
court
that
that
terminology,
under
this
section,
was
referring
to
the
declaratory
relief
or
declaratory
judgment
in
the
washington,
d.c.
court,
and
this
court
does
not
have
jurisdiction
because
the
three-judge
appellate
court
--
i
mean,
three-judge
district
court
in
the
southern
district
of
mississippi
was
improperly
convened.
if
any
action
lied
at
all,
forgetting
about
all
the
other
technicalities,
the
jurisdiction
would
have
been
in
a
one-judge
district
court.
and,
as
i
say,
of
course,
we'll
admit
that
is
not
necessarily
compel,
as
justice
holland
said
in
the
swift
case,
does
not
compel
a
reading
of
that
but
it
is
a
more
appropriate
reading,
and
the
rationale
of
the
swift
case
was,
in
construing
2281,
that
anytime
we
construe
any
section
which
gives
jurisdiction
to
a
three-judge
court
we
should
construe
it
in
a
limited
manner
to
keep
from
placing
the
burden
upon
three
judges
and
the
appellate
court.
now,
counsel
opposite
says
that
it
is
appropriate.
why
is
it
appropriate?
because
of
the
rationale
of
2281
and
the
concern
of
congress
that
we
have
here
a
clash
between
the
state
of
mississippi
and
appellants
on
what
we
can
enforce
and
what
we
cannot
enforce.
well,
of
course,
that
isn't
true,
and
that
was
laid
to
rest
in
the
swift
case.
we
are
not
really
concerned
with
a
clash
between
the
state
of
mississippi
and
its
laws
on
a
constitutional
ground.
we
are
merely
concerned
with
the
same
clash
that
you
found
in
the
swift
case
with
the
supremacy
clause
and
whether
or
not
what
we
had
done
in
mississippi
is
in
disregard
to
an
act
of
congress.
so,
it
does
not
rise
to
the
dignity
of
what
congress
was
worried
about
when
they
enacted
2281.
it
does
not
rise
to
the
dignity
of
a
one-judge
district
court
enjoining
the
operation
of
a
state
law
on
unconstitutional
grounds.
and,
as
this
court
held
in
the
philips
case,
if
we
are
merely
talking
about
whether
an
individual
was
unconstitutionally
applying
the
law,
even
in
that
case,
we
would
not
have
this
situation.
mr.
william
a.allain
in
the
district
court
of,
d.c.?
your
honor,
when
you
go
to
the
washington,
d.c.
court,
you
go
up
there
as
the
petitioner,
but
you
have
to
prove
this
and
the
burden
of
proof
rests
on
you.
you
have
to
prove
that
this
law
was
not
passed
for
the
purpose
and
effect
of
denying
someone
their
constitutional
rights,
voting
rights,
because
of
race.
it
is
a
fifteenth
amendment
question
in
that
sense.
you
would
think
that
2281
would
give
you
jurisdiction.
there
is
a
colloquy
between
senator
irving
and
senator
katzenbach
--
i
mean,
attorney
general
katzenbach
--
mr.
william
a.allain
which
we
have
cited
in
our
brief.
mr.
william
a.allain
and,
which
say
even
though
you
have
the
same
effect,
even
though
that
court
is
making
a
declaratory
judg
--
is
denying
your
declaratory
judgment
is
what
they're
doing,
in
essence
they
are
saying
this.
you
have
not
proved
that
the
purpose
and
effect
of
this
act
is
not
unconstitutional.
mr.
william
a.allain
you're
absolutely
correct,
mr.
marshall.
mr.
william
a.allain
with
all
deference
to
your
honor,
it
does
not
because
it
does
not
draw
into
question
the
same
type
of
act.
mr.
william
a.allain
it
does
not
draw
in
the
question
on
constitutionality.
it
does
not
draw
in
the
question
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
fifteenth
amendment.
it
merely
draws
into
question
what
was
drawn
in
the
question
in
the
swift
case,
the
supremacy
clause
in
which
this
court
said
that
that
would
not
reached
the
dignity
in
which
congress
was
concerned
with.
and,
i
think
that
colloquy
between
those
two
gentlemen
in
the
hearings
recognized
it
was
actually
--
what
you're
doing
is
the
same
thing.
mr.
william
a.allain
that's
right,
your
honor.
that's
correct.
mr.
william
a.allain
if
they
have
--
mr.
william
a.allain
if
they
have
a
right
--
mr.
william
a.allain
your
honor,
it
is
not
really
--
i
hate
to
get
in
rights
because
we've
made
the
distinction
in
our
brief
to
the
court
between
remedies
and
right,
but
let's
forget
about
that
in
this
instance.
if
they
have
some
kind
of
right
to
enforce
section
5,
they
have
another
jurisdictional
statute
which
they
have
alluded
to,
which
they
have
asserted
in
their
complaint
that
they
had
been
denied
some
right
given
to
them
by
congress.
but,
we
are
merely
talking
about
what
did
congress
mean
about
is
that
a
right
under
this
pursuant
to
or
is
it
pursuant
to
a
general
jurisdictional
statute
of
a
right
which
hwas
vested
under
section
5?
mr.
william
a.allain
no,
they
do
not.
mr.
william
a.allain
they
do
not.
mr.
william
a.allain
justice
white
had,
i
think,
assumed
that
they
had
a
right
under
section
5.
mr.
william
a.allain
i
thought
this
question
to
me
was
the
assumption
of
a
right.
mr.
william
a.allain
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
william
a.allain
in
the
action
under,
and
what
we
had
claimed
in
the
--
mr.
william
a.allain
not
in
intent
of
congress
in
the
way
the
language
is
written.
the
jurisdiction
--
mr.
william
a.allain
the
jurisdiction
is
what
we're
speaking
of.
mr.
william
a.allain
it
comes
from
the
general
jurisdiction
statute
which
allows
him
to
seek
injunctive
relief,
i
believe.
mr.
william
a.allain
what
i'm
trying
to
--
mr.
william
a.allain
i'm
--
yes,
your
honor,
but
--
mr.
william
a.allain
right.
mr.
william
a.allain
they're
asking
for
--
mr.
william
a.allain
they
are
asking
for
more.
they
are
asking
for
the
language
that
any
action
brought
under
--
mr.
william
a.allain
essentially,
that's
what
they're
after.
mr.
william
a.allain
with
difference
to
your
honor,
i
do
not
think
that
if
we
found
that
they
had
a
right
existing
or
given
to
them
by
section
5
that
the
action
under
section
5
which
congress
was
referring
to
is
that
action.
i
think
that's
under
the
general
jurisdictional
statute.
mr.
william
a.allain
right.
mr.
william
a.allain
yes,
your
honor,
i
said
it
was
not
--
this
language
did
not
compel
that
reading.
it
was
a
more
appropriate
reading
of
it,
and
with
the
rationale
of
the
swift
case.
i
would
not
say
--
i
stand
before
this
court
and
say
this
court
would
be
way
off
base
if
it
did
so
hold,
but
i
think
our
interpretation
in
the
legislative
history
and
the
type
of
action
talking
about
in
the
three-judge
situation
would
lead
to
the
more
appropriate
reading
which
we
say
should
be
the
reading.
mr.
william
a.allain
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
a.allain
the
legislative
history
is
rather
weak
in
that
particular
--
mr.
william
a.allain
i'm
not
too
sure
of
that,
your
honor.
mr.
william
a.allain
your
honor,
i
do
not
give
a
lot
of
weight
into
the
change
into
the
language.
i
do
not
read
it
and
see
how
it
changes
necessarily
the
reading
of
the
language.
and,
as
we
all
know,
of
course,
somebody
in
congress
might
have
thought,
one,
the
language
might
be
better
to
bring
about
something
and
i
hate
to
get
into
reason
why
somebody
brought
the
language.
mr.
william
a.allain
i
don't
think
the
reading
itself
necessarily
means
that.
mr.
william
a.allain
no,
your
honor,
i
do
not.
mr.
william
a.allain
i
don't
have
no
offsetting
legislative
history.
we
say
that
the
private
parties
lack
standing
for
this
for
this
simple
reason.
i
think
it
showed
and
it's
illustrative
of
what
we've
been
doing
here
today.
the
1965
voting
rights
act
is
more
like
a
jigsaw
picture.
i'd
rather
say
picture
than
puzzle.
and,
it
must
be
read
together
and,
like
a
jigsaw,
when
you
pull
one
piece
of
it
out
and
isolate
it
and
say,
now,
what
does
this
section
say,
that's
when
you
find
yourself
in
trouble.
now,
we
think
the
entire
act,
as
we
said
before,
was
remedies
and
not
rights.
and,
as
this
court
said
in
the
south
carolina
case,
speaking
through
the
chief
justice,
that
this
act
created
new
and
stringent
remedies
that
this
act
and
congress
had
marshaled
an
array
of
weapons
to
be
used
effectively
by
the
united
states,
and
we
feel
that
it
--
mr.
william
a.allain
for
the
purpose,
your
honor,
of,
one,
seeing
that
no
one
is
denied
in
the
future
any
of
their
constitutional
rights
and
to
eradicate
what
rights
have
been
denied
in
the
past.
mr.
william
a.allain
that's
true,
your
honor,
but
the
act
itself,
and
as
your
honor
stated,
the
act
itself,
we're
talking
about
the
fifteenth
amendment.
that
is
where
the
rights
come
from.
south
carolina
--
in
south
carolina,
your
honor
said
that
fifteenth
amendment
is
self-executed,
that
these
people
had
certain
rights
at
that
time.
we
passed
the
1957
voting
rights
act.
we
passed
the
1960
voting
rights
act.
we
passed
something
in
1964
and,
yet,
their
rights
under
the
fifteenth
amendment
had
not
been
vindicated.
so,
what
had
congress
done?
congress
had
created
new
and
stringent
remedies,
not
rights
but
remedies.
mr.
william
a.allain
for
the
vindication,
and
placed
them
on
the
hands
of
what
body?
the
attorney
general.
why?
because
it
is
a
public
interest
we're
talking
about
here
and
not
just
an
individual
interest.
now,
it's
rather
odd
that
the
government
at
this
time
takes
the
position
that
a
private
party
can
bring
a
lawsuit
when,
in
the
apache
county
arizona
case
in
which
we've
cited
in
our
brief
citing
their
brief,
they
say
the
responsibility
--
the
complete
responsibility
rest
with
the
government
and,
in
that
particular
case,
they
tried
to
keep
the
--
some
of
the
indians
of
arizona
from
intervening
because
they
said
"no,
you
don't
have
any
right
in
this
lawsuit."
we
are
vindicating
a
public
right
and,
in
their
brief,
they
took
the
position
that
the
responsibility
rest
in
the
attorney
general
and
they
set
out
as
one
of
the
sections,
section
5.
now,
as
justice
black
said
in
his
dissent
in
regard
to
section
5,
this
is
something
new
in
the
law.
this
is
something
that's
harsh
in
the
law.
and,
as
this
court
said,
it
is
harsh,
but
harsh
means
"when
necessary."
therefore,
we
do
not
believe
that
congress
would've
placed
this
type
of
action,
this
type
of
remedy
in
just
at
the
whim
of
any
individual
who
wanted
to
bring
a
lawsuit
and
say
"now,
look,
you
haven't
gone
up
in
the
attorney
general's
office
first."
look
at
the
ratifications
that
might
come
from
that.
let's
assume
that
we
did
go
to
the
attorney
general's
office.
let's
assume
that
we
went
up
there
with
the
act
itself
and
said
"mr.
attorney
general,
here
is
the
act,
read
it
and
will
you
give
us
a
written
opinion."
and,
he
says
--
he
reads
and
he
says
"that
is
fine,i
have
no
objection
to
it."
i
don't
know
of
any
publication
of
that.
i
don't
know
how
any
citizen
is
going
to
know
about
that,
but
every
citizen
in
mississippi
or
alabama,
virginia,
or
anybody
who
come
within
the
act
can
then
say
"well,
i'm
just
going
to
bring
a
lawsuit
because
i
don't
think
you've
gone
to
the
1965
voting
rights
act."
mr.
william
a.allain
never
hears
of
the
act?
your
honor,
i
think
the
act
--
mr.
william
a.allain
excuse
me.
mr.
william
a.allain
bring
it
to
the
attention
of
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states.
mr.
william
a.allain
by
letter
or,
i
hate
to
say
telephone
conversation
but,
by
any
method
to
relay
to
the
attorney
general's
office.
mr.
william
a.allain
he
could
not
go
to
court
about
it
under
section
5,
your
honor.
he
could
go
to
court
about
it
only
on
the
facts
that
it
was
unconstitutional
under
the
fifteenth
amendment.
mr.
william
a.allain
no,
your
honor,
he
could
not.
mr.
william
a.allain
they
would
not
be
out
of
luck,
your
honor,
because
we
will
have
to
assume
and
congress
assumed
that
the
attorney
general
would
do
his
duty.
they
have
to
assume
that
--
mr.
william
a.allain
we
would've
submitted
it
if
we
felt,
your
honor,
that
it
was
within
the
purview
of
the
1965
voting
rights
act.
but,
getting
back
to
your
honor's
question
of
what
would
the
individual
have
to
do,
he
could
submit
that
to
the
attorney
general's
office
not
for
approval,
don't
get
me
wrong.
mr.
william
a.allain
as
to
the
1965
voting
rights
act
and
to
the
suspension
and
the
submission,
none,
your
honor,
because
that's
not
a
right
of
his.
it's
not
his
--
really
the
right
he's
got
to
do
anything
about
it.
mr.
william
a.allain
well,
your
honor,
there's
a
section
in
the
act
which
says
that
if
a
man
is
denied
the
right
to
vote,
the
action
of
vote
having
counted,
that
he
can
submit
that
to
the
attorney
general
and
the
attorney
general
may
bring
an
action,
and
they
bring
an
action.
mr.
william
a.allain
well,
your
honor,
he
--
mr.
william
a.allain
he
is
without
remedy
to
see
that
the
state
of
mississippi
first
submitted.
this
is
something
new.
it's
not
something
that
he
had
as
under
the
constitution.
it
was
something
congress
came
up
with.
if
congress
wanted
to
limit
who
they
would
allow
to
sue,
that's
congress'
--
mr.
william
a.allain
you
have
a
remedy,
your
honor.
see,
that
phr
--
i
don't
like
to
further
the
right.
mr.
william
a.allain
because
no
right
was
conveyed
upon
him.
mr.
william
a.allain
that
is
the
remedy.
your
honor,
what
i'm
trying
to
say
is
that
it
has
created
no
right
in
the
private
citizen.
the
private
citizen
says
"look,
i
got
a
right
but
got
no
remedy."
the
right
was
created
--
or
the
remedy
was
created
by
congress
and
it
gave
it
to
the
attorney
general.
now,
the
man
standing
over
him
has
not
been
heard
because
we're
not
talking
about
constitutionality
of
the
fifteenth
amendment.
we're
talking
about
a
mere
process
that
congress
felt
was
necessary
to
inform
the
attorney
general.
mr.
william
a.allain
he
can
bring
an
independent
lawsuit,
your
honor,
based
on
that.
mr.
william
a.allain
well,
as
we
said
in
the
court
here
today
that
if
he
gets
--
if
we
extend
the
law,
as
the
appellants
attempt
to
extend
today
--
mr.
william
a.allain
well,
if
--
he
had
a
remedy
in
the
district
court
of
washington,
d.c.
mr.
william
a.allain
if
--
mr.
william
a.allain
sir?
mr.
william
a.allain
i
get
that
from
the
section
which
says
that,
as
far
as
the
declaratory
judgment,
it
must
be
by
the
--
it's
in
section,
i
think,
section
12.
mr.
william
a.allain
you're
right,
sir.
mr.
william
a.allain
that's
my
position
because
its'
not
section
5
that
takes
away
the
authority.
it's
section,
i
think,
section
12
which
says
no
--
or
13,
no
declaratory
judgment
shall
be
entered
except
in
the
washington,
d.c.
court,
but
that
is
talking
strictly
to
section
5
and
section
4.
but,
i
think
we
must
tie
this
--
the
whole
thing
here
that
the
government
themselves
had
stated,
that
the
responsibility
of
enforcing
this
act
is
in
them.
if,
let's
take
on
the
section
4.
we
had
a
tested
advice.
now,
the
act
is
brought
in
washington,
d.c.
you
can't
go
to
the
attorney
general's
office
under
section
4.
you
bring
it
in
washington,
d.c.
you
have
the
burden
of
proving
that
there's
been
no
purpose
of
effect
of
discriminating
the
last
five
years.
there's
no
right
of
intervention
for
a
private
party.
that's
a
position
that
the
attorney
general's
office
took
in
the
apache
county
case.
so,
we
have
here
again
something
that
you
might
say
is
a
remedy,
but
no
right
in
this
private
individual
to
come
in
and
say
"yes,
there
had
been
some
discrimination."
now,
in
the
apache
county
case,
the
district
court
did
allow
an
intervention
but
under
its
inherent
powers,
but
the
attorney
general's
office
took
the
very
opposite
view.
now,
the
next
question,
your
honor,
that
we
come
to
if
the
court
did
not
buy
argument
on
all
this
other
and
felt
the
jurisdiction
lies
here
and
the
private
citizen
does
have
the
right,
we're
talking
about
redistricting,
reapportionment
in
adams
and
forrest
counties.
now,
we
say
the
legislative
history,
the
legislative
intent,
had
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
reapportionment.
we
say
that
the
con
--
the
intent
of
the
act
had
only
to
do
with
things
which
went
directly
to
the
vote
of
the
registration
and
nothing
absolutely
to
do
to
how
a
candidate
shall
be
selected.
now,
here,
they're
talking
about
a
dilution
of
vote.
there'd
been
no
dilution
of
vote
in
this
particular
case.
instead
of
voting
for
one
supervisor,
they
may
go
for
five
supervisors.
the
counties
had
only
done
what
this
court
has
commanded
in
the
avery
case,
to
give
the
vote
to
be
weighed
across
the
board.
now,
we
don't
think
there's
anything
in
the
legislative
history,
in
the
debates,
in
this
case
--
this
court's
decision
in
south
carolina
that
would
ever
say
that
reapportionment
cases
or
redistricting
cases
were
contemplated
under
the
provision
of
section
5
of
the
voting
rights
act.
and,
it's
--
to
look
at
the
hearings
themselves,
and
this
is
merely
what
we
call
a
freezing,
what
we've
got
here
is
a
legislative
freezing.
on
several
occasions,
the
attorney
general
alluded
to
the
fact
that
this
is
nothing
more
than
like
a
reapportionment
case
where
the
court
says
"this
plan
is
wrong,
go
back
and
get
another
plan
and
come
in
here
and
let's
look
at
it,
and
if
we
like
it,
fine,
stamp
of
approval."
but,
nobody
asked
the
next
question,
the
very
next
logical
question,
if
it
were
ever
in
the
minds
of
anybody.
reapportionment
has
been
in
the
minds
of
congress.
they'd
been
trying
to
get
an
act
passed
so
they
can
take
it
out
of
the
court's
hands.
the
next
logical
question
would've
been
"well,
mr.
attorney
general,
does
this
apply
to
reapportionment
cases?"
he
was
talking
about
the
same
type
of
authority,
same
type
of
freezing
principle
and,
yet,
nobody
asked
the
next
logical
question.
why
didn't
they
ask
the
next
logical
question?
because
everybody
in
those
hearings,
the
president
already
knew
that
they
were
not
talking
about
redistricting
and
reapportionment.
that
they
were
talking
about
--
they
would
directly
affect
the
vote.
they
were
talking
about
tests
and
devices
and
then
supplementing
--
i
mean,
putting
something
else
in
that
effect.
we
know
here
that
section
4
and
section
5
are
connected.
section
5
goes
out
of
the
window
once
section
4
is
no
more
applicable.
why?
we're
talking
about
section
--
tests
and
devices
in
section
4,
and
the
same
type
of
thing
they
were
talking
about
in
section
5
was
saying
that
you're
going
to
supplant
for
the
tests
and
devices.
we
say
to
the
court
that
if
this
court
finds
that
this
type
if
actions
come
within
the
purview
of
the
voting
rights
act
of
1950
--
1965,
you
have
almost
started
the
reapportionment,
you
have
taken
out
of
the
district
court
the
right
to
look
at
any
plan
and
approve
that
plan,
and
they
had
placed
in
washington,
d.c.
now,
there
had
been
a
lot
of
talk
here
this
morning
about
"well,
if
you
submit
your
plan,
if
it's
good,
you'll
get
it
approved."
suppose
a
count
--
a
state
doesn't
want
to
submit
the
plan.
suppose
a
county
doesn't
want
to
submit
the
plan.
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
it?
this
would
completely
establish
what
the
reynolds
case
said,
what
the
fourteenth
amendment
case
has
said.
mr.
william
a.allain
you
mean
the
relief
to
be
granted
by
this
court,
your
honor?
mr.
william
a.allain
your
honor,
i
only
used
that
argument
as
to
the
effect
that
i
do
not
believe
that
congress
ever
intended
to
fully
roadblock
or
to
impair
or
put
an
obstacle
in
the
path
of
the
rationale
of
the
reynolds
case
and
avery
versus
midland
texas.
i
think
--
mr.
william
a.allain
i'm
just
posing
that
before
the
court.
mr.
william
a.allain
no,
your
honor.
i
was
suggesting
that
the,
more
or
less,
absurdity
of
the
fact
that
congress,
concerned
with
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
redistricting
will
come
along
here
with
the
1965
voting
rights
act,
had
ever
intend
--
mr.
william
a.allain
that's
right,
your
honor,
if
it
ever
intend
that
that
be
taken
out
of
that
particular
act.
mr.
wells,
your
honor,
will
direct
his
remarks
basically
to
the
cases
which
are
involved.
thank
you.
mr.
william
a.allain
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we
are
a
little
bit
concerned
ourselves
about
the
type
of
relief
which
the
appellants
seem
to
want
in
the
court
today.
we
are
on
the
impression,
at
first,
they
want
to
set
aside
the
elections
which
were
held
in
november
and
have
new
elections.
in
view
of
the
position
they
have
taken
today,
we
feel
that
maybe
one
of
the
most
important
questions
before
the
court
is
whether
or
not
this
issue
is
moot,
whether
or
not
the
submission
by
this
court
to
the
attorney
general
and
then
the
submission
by
us
in
our
response
brief
to
their
brief,
gave
them
the
information,
gave
them
the
notice
that
is
required
by
section
5
of
the
1965
voting
rights
act.
now,
we
say
it
is.
we
know
of
no
formal
submission
that
has
to
be
made
to
the
attorney
general's
office.
mr.
william
a.allain
no,
sir.
i
think
there's
nothing
in
the
briefs.
in
fact,
he
states
in
his
brief
there
that
he
is
reserving
onto
himself
the
right
to
approve
or
disapprove
at
a
later
date.
we
say
to
that
que
--
to
that
assertion,
he
cannot
reserve
onto
himself
longer
than
the
60
days
which
congress
itself
has
placed
in
the
act
is
the
time
in
which
he
must
make
some
kind
of
determination.
now,
he
speaks
of
a
formal
right.
i
know
of
no
directive
that
the
attorney
general's
office
is
put
out
on
how
we
shall
submit
to
the
attorney
general
our
new
laws.
and,
just
because
--
mr.
william
a.allain
while
the
other
states
have
submitted
them
in
one
matter
or
the
other
is
not
binding
upon
the
state
of
mississippi
nor
is
it
controlling
as
to
the
--
what
congress
really
intended
to
do
in
section
5.
mr.
william
a.allain
no,
your
honor,
it
could
be
moot
if
they
have
withdrawn
their
request
for
the
relief
which
they
have
passed
upon.
it
was
my
understanding
the
position
taken
by
counsel
opposite,
counsel
for
the
appellant
and
not
the
amicus
in
this
case,
that
as
far
as
they
were
concerned,
what
they
were
really
asking
for
was
for
this
court
to
tell
mississippi
to
submit
this
to
the
attorney
general's
office
and
let
him
approve
or
disapprove.
now,
we
say
this
court
cannot
command
nor
direct
the
state
of
mississippi
to
do
something
which
is
beyond
the
scope
of
the
act
itself.
we
say,
at
this
late
date,
that
this
has
already
been
done,
exactly
what
appellants
want.
it
has
been
submitted
to
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states.
he
has
not
exercised
his
prerogative
within
the
60
days.
mr.
william
a.allain
that's
true,
your
honor.
mr.
william
a.allain
at
that
time,
what
--
mr.
william
a.allain
when
we
submitted
our
response
to
their
brief,
at
that
time,
we
put
them
on
notice
through
the
attorney
general's
office.
mr.
william
a.allain
that's
true,
your
honor,
and
i
do
not
know
what
the
statute
really
means
by
submit.
does
it
mean
by
telephone
conversation?
does
it
mean
by
any
brief?
does
it
mean
by
passing
on
the
street
if
we
met
the
attorney
general
and
say
"we've
got
a
new
law
in
mississippi"?
mr.
william
a.allain
yes,
your
honor,
it
has.
mr.
william
a.allain
we
have
submitted,
your
honor,
in
our
brief.
he
has
been
put
on
notice
--
mr.
william
a.allain
as
required.
that
is
the
only
submission
that
we
have
made.
your
honor,
let
me
refer
you
to
one
thing
that
did
happen,
and
this
is
a
submission
or
at
least
the
attorney
general
office
accepted
as
such,
we
passed
a
constitutional
amendment
in
which
we
have
lowered
the
residence
statute
of
mississippi
from
two
years
to
one
year.
they
sent
registrars
into
the
state
of
mississippi
just
recently
here
to
register
individuals
under
the
act.
i
was
sitting
at
my
desk
one
day.
a
telephone
call
comes
in
for
mr.
bob
moore
of
the
justice
department
asking
me,
he
said,
"we
have
known
through
the
paper
or
otherwise
that
this
constitutional
amendment
had
been
approved."
we
have
never
submitted
it.
he
says
"is
that
true?"
i
said,
"yes."
he
says
"is
it
in
the
constitution?"
i
said
"yes."
he
said
"we
will
not
notify
the
federal
registrars
to
use
that
as
a
qualification."
that
is
submission.
that
is
approval.
now,
your
honor,
i
don't
know
any
formality.
i
don't
see
how
the
attorney
general's
office
can
stand
here
today
and
say
there's
some
formality
when
they
have
acquiesce
in
a
change
which
came
about
after
november
1,
1964,
when
i
have
submitted
it
over
a
telephone
conversation
and
they,
through
their
officials
and
agents,
have
put
it
into
effect.
that,
your
honor,
we
think
is
--
actually,
section
5
is
more
of
an
informal
thing
and
it
must
be
tied
in
to
whether
or
not
a
private
suite
can
be
brought.
we
think,
actually,
the
legislative
history
shown
from
the
--
as
we
quote
in
our
brief,
the
attorney
general
just
didn't
want
to
have
to
roam
over
the
southern
states.
mr.
william
a.allain
that's
true,
your
honor.
i
say
--
mr.
william
a.allain
at
the
threshold,
if
that
was
decided
as
a
mooted
question,
you
would
not
even
have
to
reach
these
other
questions
which
been
brought
closer.
mr.
william
a.allain
yes,
your
honor,
we
could
say
that
because
if
it
had
been
a
mooted
question
we
would
have
no
case
of
controversy
here
because
the
relief
in
question
have
already,
or
so
i
think
have,
been
withdrawn
as
far
as
the
appellants
are
concerned
with.
the
problem
is
in
--
mr.
william
a.allain
no,
your
honor,
but,
as
this
court
--
mr.
william
a.allain
what
we're
saying,
your
honor,
is
this.
we
do
not
--
mr.
william
a.allain
we
can't
submit
--
mr.
william
a.allain
no,
your
honor.
mr.
william
a.allain
but
we
do
not
believe
we
had
to
submit
it,
but
it
was
submitted
and,
therefore,
is
a
mooted
issue
and
there's
nothing
left
for
this
court
to
decide.
mr.
william
a.allain
through
the
clerk
and
also,
your
honor,
through
our
response
brief
which
brought
attention
to
the
attorney
general
informally
or,
in
this
case,
very
formally
in
writing
that
we
had
such
a
law.
he
had
60
days
and
he
has
done
nothing
about
it.
mr.
william
a.allain
mr.
chief
justice,
i
do
not
intend
to
delay
the
point
any
longer,
your
honors,
in
regard
to
the
mootness
question,
though
we
do
feel
it
in
a
very
serious
question
in
this
case,
but
i
would
like
to
refer
the
court
to
our
brief
in
which
we
have
quoted
from
the
memorandum
submitted
to
the
attorney
general
in
this
particular
case.
"since
section
5's
approval
procedure
was
devi
--
designed
to
serve
an
informing
function
to
provide
a
method
of
bringing
to
the
attention
of
the
government
changes
in
state
law,"
we
again
submit
that
this
was
merely
to
keep
the
attorney
general
from
roaming
all
over
the
southern
states
affected
by
1965
voting
rights
act
and
trying
to
find
out
every
time
when
a
new
law
in
regard
to
voting
was
put
into
effect
in
these
states.
it
was
merely
--
mr.
william
a.allain
page
15,
your
honor,
of
our
brief,
brief
of
the
appellees,
page
15.
mr.
william
a.allain
that's
in
the
25,
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
a.allain
which
means,
that
we
seriously
urge
the
court
that
the
informing
that
the
attorney
general
received
in
this
case
was
sufficient
by
the
legislative
history,
by
the
intent
of
congress,
by
the
interpretation
placed
upon
that
section
by
the
attorney
general's
office
themselves,
that
there
was
no
need
for
any
formal
type
of
notice
given
to
the
attorney
general's
office.
we
would
further
direct
the
court's
attention
or
invite
the
court's
attention
to
page
22
of
the
memorandum
of
the
united
states
as
amicus.
in
which
--
in
this
particular
brief
and
on
page
22
thereof,
they
admit
or
seem
to
admit
that
the
section
5
applies
to
reapportionment
or
to
redistricting,
what
we
have
in
this
particular
case
before
the
court
today,
and
then
they
say,
"the
most
that
can
be
assumed
from
past
silence
is
that
the
attorney
general
was
not
prepared
to
impose
an
objection
to
the
changes
being
at
--
effective
and,
thus,
declined
to
seek
to
compel
a
state
or
political
subdivision
to
comply
with
what
would
have,
in
all
likelihood,
been
a
wholly
formalistic
step
that
would
merely
have
delayed
final
implementation
of
a
constitutional
required
restruction
of
government."
they
are
admitting
there
that,
as
far
as
they're
concerned,
there
may
be
other
areas
in
which
there
has
been
a
restruction
of
government
and
they
did
not
feel
that
they
should
make
them
take
the
formalistic
step.
now,
this,
your
honor,
does
not
tie
in
or
does
not
fit
in
with
mr.
justice
brennan's
remarks
and
i
think
mr.
justice
white's
remarks
that
it
is
not
for
the
attorney
general
to
make
that
decision
whether
or
not
they're
going
to
be
suspended.
if
they
are
suspended,
they
are
suspended
until,
if
they
come
within
the
purview
of
section
5,
the
attorney
there
submitted
to
the
attorney
general's
office
and
approve
or
disapprove
then
that
is
appeal
to
the
washington,,
d.c.
court.
what
they're
saying
here
is
that
there
might
be
other
areas
throughout
the
south
land,
but
we
did
not
feel
that
we
ought
to
take
any
step
to
make
them
do
that.
well,
if
you're
going
to
be
consistent
and
say
that
section
5
says
that
the
act
suspends
these,
what
he
is
saying
is
that
we've
got
laws
out
there
that
are
being
suspended.
we
know
they're
being
enforced,
but
we
will
not
do
our
duty
under
section
12
(d)
of
the
act
of
sec
--
in
section
12
which
says
that
the
attorney
general
can
bring
an
injunction
proceeding
to
keep
those
states
from
doing
what
section
5
says
they
cannot
do.
mr.
william
a.allain
i
would
take
that
position,
mr.
justice
white,
because
we
take
the
position
that
they
do
not
come
under
the
1965
voting
rights
act.
if
the
--
this
court
was
to
hold
or
if
the
position
was
taken
as
appellants
apparently
take
it
that
it
does
come
on
the
1965
voting
rights
act,
then
they
could
not
challenge
it
in
a
local
district
court
bec
--
mr.
william
a.allain
yes,
your
honor.
excuse
me.
i
misunderstood
your
question.
mr.
william
a.allain
if
--
mr.
william
a.allain
if
that
is
correct,
then
they
do
have,
and
we
submit
in
our
brief,
your
honor,
that
they
have
that
right,
then
they
had
the
right
on
the
local
level
to
bring
a
suit
under
the
fifteenth
amendment
which
is
what
they
--
and
let
me
--
i'd
like
to
clear
this
up
in
the
marshall
case
and
in
the
fairley
case
which
is
the
appellant
supervisors.
we
do
not
have,
in
that
case,
a
fifteenth
or
a
fourteenth
amendment
question.
that
was
taken
out
not
by
stipulation,
as
in
the
other
two
cases.
that
was
taken
out
by
a
petition
or
a
motion
filed
on
the
part
of
the
appellants,
an
order
granting
that
that
second
claim
of
the
f
--
be
taken
out
of
the
lawsuit
entirely.
so,
we
stand
before
the
court
today
resting
entirely
upon
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court
and
the
three-judge
district
court
in
the
trial
of
the
district
court
--
mr.
william
a.allain
upon
the
act
in
it
of
itself.
mr.
william
a.allain
your
honor,
i
would
think
--
mr.
william
a.allain
no,
your
honor.
i
think
it
would
be
more
of
the
fact
that
they
did
not
take
any
action
is,
more
or
less,
an
approval
of
it.
and,
congress
intended
it
to
be,
more
or
less,
retroactive.
mr.
william
a.allain
that
if
they
would
become
effective
after
that
date
--
mr.
william
a.allain
right,
sir.
mr.
william
a.allain
to
my
knowledge,
he
had
not,
sir.
mr.
william
a.allain
my
feeling
in
it,
your
honor,
would
be
that
if
a
law
was
passed
or
put
into
effect
and
it
was
submitted
to
him
and
he
has
the
60
days,
that
even
if
he
did
not
act
within
that
time
or
he
approved
it,
that
it
would
be
more
or
less
retroactive
and
it
would
become
effective
as
of
the
time
in
which
it
was
put
into
effect.
mr.
william
a.allain
to
my
mootness
argument,
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
william
a.allain
right.
mr.
william
a.allain
no,
sir.
mr.
william
a.allain
according
to
my
position,
it
was
last
term,
your
honor.
first,
when
you
--
when
the
court
had
requested
that
this
--
mr.
william
a.allain
amicus
should
be
filed.
i'm
not
sure
of
the
date,
your
honor,
but
i
do
know
that
it's
--
mr.
william
a.allain
whatever
date
it
is.
mr.
william
a.allain
at
that
time.
mr.
william
a.allain
until
submitted
by
this
court.
mr.
william
a.allain
but,
he's
not
acting
up
on
it,
your
honor.
we
think
congress
intended
it
would
be
retroactive
and
it'd
be
effective
as
of
the
date
in
which
it
was
passed
whether
he
approved
it
or
whether
he
did
not
do
anything
about
it.
we
think
you'd
almost
have
to
read
that
into
the
act
to
keep
the
--
to
keep
it
from
being
in
suspension
in
that
period
of
time
when
nothing
would
be
really
in
effect
or
there'd
be
some
conflict
of
the
law.
your
honor,
we
would
like
to
say
this
in
moot
--
excuse
me
sir?
mr.
william
a.allain
your
honor,
i
think
that
he
would
have
to
have
some
type
of
idea
of
what's
informal
because
i
don't
--
really,
we
may
be
limiting
but
some
manner
from
an
official
of
the
state
of
mississippi.
now,
as
i
illustrated,
the
one
in
which
the
government
accepted
was
a
telephone
conversation,
but
it
did
come
from
an
assistant
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
mississippi
to
a
justice
department
attorney.
i
was
being
somewhat
facetious
when
i
told
mr.
justice
marshall
about,
on
a
street
corner
or
something,
there
would
be
no
documented
evidence
of
it
or
there
would
not
be
an
official
of
one
of
the
state
and
an
official
of
the
federal
government.
i'm
not
sure
if
the
chief
justice
is
speaking
of
some
formality
of
some
writing,
some
correspondent,
some
letter,
or
just
what
we
have
here.
mr.
william
a.allain
if
the
court
please,
they
have
accepted
it
apparently
in
that
manner,
and
i
will
place
the
instruction
they've
placed
on
it.
mr.
william
a.allain
i
think
it
should
be,
your
honor.
mr.
william
a.allain
if
the
court
please,
at
this
time,
that
is
really
--
in
other
words,
i
would
rather
limit
it
to
what
happened
in
this
particular
case
which
was
a
formal.
i
would
not
want
to
foreclose
it
as
a
case,
arbitrarily
in
this
term
of
court,
it
might
be
just
around
the
corner,
but
this
court
does
not
have
to
make
that
decision.
this
court
does
not
have
to
go
that
far.
this
court
can
merely
say,
in
this
case,
this
was
a
formal
or
was
all
that
was
necessary
under
section
5.
i
would
hate
to
--
mr.
william
a.allain
right,
sir.
mr.
william
a.allain
right,
sir.
mr.
william
a.allain
right,
sir.
mr.
william
a.allain
i
contend
it
was,
your
honor.
i
contend
that
the
government
contended
that
it
was.
mr.
william
a.allain
i
do
think
so,
your
honor.
i
really
do.
now,
i
would
like
to
say
this.
now,
at
the
outset,
counsel
for
opposite
place
quite
a
bit
of
their
time
and
effort
discussing
ratios
of
negro
to
white
discussing
the
counties,
how
their
makeup
was.
now,
i
would
be
less
than
honest
with
this
court.
if
i
was
to
stand
before
you
and
say
there
is
no
racial
overtones
here,
that
until
i
came
here
today
i
didn't
realize
that
race
was
one
of
the
prime
movers
of
this
particular
lawsuit,
but
i
will
say
this.
before
this
court,
race
is
not
a
question.
as
justice
stewart
said
earlier,
we
only
have
a
question
before
this
court,
first,
of
the
jurisdiction
which
has
been
limited
discussion
over
as
of
this
time
and,
secondly,
whether
or
not
this
act,
i
don't
care
where
it
was,
i
don't
care
if
they
were
all-whites
or
all-negro,
whether
or
not
this
type
of
act
in
the
marshall
and
the
fairley
case,
and
i
would
like
to
limit
my
argument
to
that,
mr.
wells
will
discuss
the
other
cases,
whether
or
not
it
came
within
the
purview
of
the
1965
voting
rights
act.
and,
i
think
i'd
like
to
make
that
clear
because
there
is
no
need
to
discuss
in
this
case
racial,
but
i
would
like
to
say
this
in
regard
to
a
question
posed
by
mr.
justice
fortas.
we
know
that
this
court
decided
in
the
avery
versus
midland
county
texas
case
that
the
rationale
of
the
reynolds
v.sims
goes
down
to
the
local
level,
and
that
was
the
first
time
this
court
had
actually
made
that
pronouncement.
april
11,
1966,
shown
in
appellant
--
appellees'
brief
at
page
15
in
number
25,
now,
let's
get
these
dates,
your
honors,
april
11,
1966,
the
chief
judge
of
the
southern
district
of
mississippi,
judge
harold
cox,
in
the
case
of
crosby
versus
pearl
river
county
in
which
a
suit
was
filed
to
de
--
command
that
--
the
supervisor
to
redistrict,
motion
to
dismiss
was
filed
on
the
grounds
that
the
rationale
of
sims
did
not
--
reynolds
did
not
come
that
far
down.
he
found
that
it
did
in
april
11,
1966,
and
he
directed
pearl
river
county
to
redistrict.
this
act,
other
suits
were
filed.
the
legislature
did
not
pass
this
act
until
may
27,
1966,
having
put
on
notice
that
the
district
courts
of
the
southern
district
of
mississippi
felt
that
the
reapportionment
decision
did
go
down
to
the
county
level.
your
honors
would
have
to
be
familiar
with
some
of
the
counties
of
mississippi
to
realize
we
don't
have
any
debates
in
the
legislature
and
the
legislative
history
which
we
can
bring
before
the
court,
but
many
other
counties
in
mississippi
cannot
be
redistrict
for
the
simple
reason
that
the
population
might
be
grouped
up
in
the
southern
area
or
the
northern
area
like
in
hines
county,
the
jackson
is
grouped
--
the
people
in
jackson
are
grouped
up
in
the
northeastern
section.
so,
the
legislature
felt
that
they
must
do
something,
put
on
notice
by
the
district
court
that
they
were
going
to
apply
this
court's
decision
in
the
reynolds
case
to
allow
these
counties
to
do
something
to
comply
with
it.
there
is
just
an
impossibility
in
many
of
the
mississippi
counties,
i'd
say
in
many
counties
throughout
the
united
states,
to
actually
draw
off
lines,
rational
lines,
and
put
the
population
where
they
would
not
be
within
a
certain
percent
of
the
ratio
in
the
five
districts.
your
honor,
because
of
the
way
that
the
population
is
grouped
up
in
one
area,
and
we
must
not
only
take
in
the
consideration,
i
think
this
court
has
said
we
don't
have
to
take
in
completely
the
population,
you
would
have
all
of
the
county
grouped
up
in
here
and
the
people
down
here
having
very
little
representation.
there
are
a
number
of
people
scattered
throughout
that
area
but
of
different
diverse
types
of
economics,
maybe
farmers
here
and
maybe
blue-collared
workers
here
and,
up
in
this
area,
white-collared
workers
and
your
wealthier
people.
it
has
been
shown
just
by
surveys
through
survey
companies
that
it
is
almost
an
impossibility
in
some
of
the
counties
for
us
to
really
redistrict.
now,
of
course,
this
court,
as
i
read
the
decisions,
have
placed
in
the
virginia
beach
case
its
stamp
of
approval
upon
the
very
thing
which
these
two
counties
had
done,
and
also
made
mention
and,
i
guess,
reapproved
the
virginia
beach
case
in
the
avery
versus
midland
county
texas
case
so,
what
i
was
trying
to
get
before
the
court
that,
irrespective
of
what
counsel
might
thought
was
the
reason
for
doing
this,
there
were
good
concrete
reasons
existing
in
mississippi's
district
courts.
mr.
william
a.allain
that's
true,
sir.
mr.
william
a.allain
your
honor,
because
the
counsel,
i
guess,
spent
so
much
time
on
it,
there
were
quite
a
number
of
questions
from
court
--
mr.
william
a.allain
and
the
bench
in
that
regard.
mr.
william
a.allain
and
i
was
really
merely
asking
--
answering
a
question
posed
by
justice
fortas
when
he
was,
i
think,
he
asked
if
there'd
been
any
commands
by
the
district
courts
or
commands
by
any
courts
to
redistrict.
and,
i
was
answering
that
question
and,
on
july
27,
1966,
a
three-judge
district
court
had
called
upon
one
of
the
counties.
that
was
prowled
of
what
was
done
in
adams
and
in
forrest
counties.
now,
moving
on
from
that
question,
your
honor,
we
come
to
the
question
which
was
actually
raised
or
not
raised
but
urged
by
this
court,
and
that
is
to
the
jurisdictional
question
and
one
in
which
the
government
was
asked
to
file
a
brief.
whether
or
not
this
court
has
jurisdiction
because,
there,
was
a
properly
convened
a
three-judge
district
court
in
mississippi.
now,
we're
all
in
accord,
i
think,
on
this
one
principle.
how
do
you
read
the
last
sentence
of
section
5
of
the
1965
voting
rights
act?
it
is
just
that
simple.
whether
any
action
under
this
section,
and
i'm
quoting
from
page
6
of
our
brief,
any
action
under
this
section
shall
be
heard
and
determined
by
a
court
of
three
judges.
now,
we
say
that
that
sentence
was
merely
referring
to
the
subject
matter
that
is
referred
to
in
section
5.
the
only
subject
matter
referred
to
in
section5,
the
only
action
referred
to
in
section
5
in
the
court
is
a
declaratory
judgment
in
the
district
court
of
washington,,
d.c.
and,
that
is
when
if
first
we
have
submitted
our
new
laws
to
the
attorney
general's
office
and
he
has
refused
to
approve
it
and
then
we
file
our
case
in
the
washington,
d.c.court
or
if
we
wanted
to
bypass
for
some
reason,
i
don't
know
what
reason
we
might
have,
the
attorney
general's
office,
we
proceed
originally
in
the
washington,
d.c.
court.
that
is
the
only
action,
court
action,
with
section
5
or
the
subject
matter
of
section
5
is
concerned
with.
and,
we
say
to
the
court
that
that
terminology,
under
this
section,
was
referring
to
the
declaratory
relief
or
declaratory
judgment
in
the
washington,
d.c.
court,
and
this
court
does
not
have
jurisdiction
because
the
three-judge
appellate
court
--
i
mean,
three-judge
district
court
in
the
southern
district
of
mississippi
was
improperly
convened.
if
any
action
lied
at
all,
forgetting
about
all
the
other
technicalities,
the
jurisdiction
would
have
been
in
a
one-judge
district
court.
and,
as
i
say,
of
course,
we'll
admit
that
is
not
necessarily
compel,
as
justice
holland
said
in
the
swift
case,
does
not
compel
a
reading
of
that
but
it
is
a
more
appropriate
reading,
and
the
rationale
of
the
swift
case
was,
in
construing
2281,
that
anytime
we
construe
any
section
which
gives
jurisdiction
to
a
three-judge
court
we
should
construe
it
in
a
limited
manner
to
keep
from
placing
the
burden
upon
three
judges
and
the
appellate
court.
now,
counsel
opposite
says
that
it
is
appropriate.
why
is
it
appropriate?
because
of
the
rationale
of
2281
and
the
concern
of
congress
that
we
have
here
a
clash
between
the
state
of
mississippi
and
appellants
on
what
we
can
enforce
and
what
we
cannot
enforce.
well,
of
course,
that
isn't
true,
and
that
was
laid
to
rest
in
the
swift
case.
we
are
not
really
concerned
with
a
clash
between
the
state
of
mississippi
and
its
laws
on
a
constitutional
ground.
we
are
merely
concerned
with
the
same
clash
that
you
found
in
the
swift
case
with
the
supremacy
clause
and
whether
or
not
what
we
had
done
in
mississippi
is
in
disregard
to
an
act
of
congress.
so,
it
does
not
rise
to
the
dignity
of
what
congress
was
worried
about
when
they
enacted
2281.
it
does
not
rise
to
the
dignity
of
a
one-judge
district
court
enjoining
the
operation
of
a
state
law
on
unconstitutional
grounds.
and,
as
this
court
held
in
the
philips
case,
if
we
are
merely
talking
about
whether
an
individual
was
unconstitutionally
applying
the
law,
even
in
that
case,
we
would
not
have
this
situation.
mr.
william
a.allain
in
the
district
court
of,
d.c.?
your
honor,
when
you
go
to
the
washington,
d.c.
court,
you
go
up
there
as
the
petitioner,
but
you
have
to
prove
this
and
the
burden
of
proof
rests
on
you.
you
have
to
prove
that
this
law
was
not
passed
for
the
purpose
and
effect
of
denying
someone
their
constitutional
rights,
voting
rights,
because
of
race.
it
is
a
fifteenth
amendment
question
in
that
sense.
you
would
think
that
2281
would
give
you
jurisdiction.
there
is
a
colloquy
between
senator
irving
and
senator
katzenbach
--
i
mean,
attorney
general
katzenbach
--
mr.
william
a.allain
which
we
have
cited
in
our
brief.
mr.
william
a.allain
and,
which
say
even
though
you
have
the
same
effect,
even
though
that
court
is
making
a
declaratory
judg
--
is
denying
your
declaratory
judgment
is
what
they're
doing,
in
essence
they
are
saying
this.
you
have
not
proved
that
the
purpose
and
effect
of
this
act
is
not
unconstitutional.
mr.
william
a.allain
you're
absolutely
correct,
mr.
marshall.
mr.
william
a.allain
with
all
deference
to
your
honor,
it
does
not
because
it
does
not
draw
into
question
the
same
type
of
act.
mr.
william
a.allain
it
does
not
draw
in
the
question
on
constitutionality.
it
does
not
draw
in
the
question
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
fifteenth
amendment.
it
merely
draws
into
question
what
was
drawn
in
the
question
in
the
swift
case,
the
supremacy
clause
in
which
this
court
said
that
that
would
not
reached
the
dignity
in
which
congress
was
concerned
with.
and,
i
think
that
colloquy
between
those
two
gentlemen
in
the
hearings
recognized
it
was
actually
--
what
you're
doing
is
the
same
thing.
mr.
william
a.allain
that's
right,
your
honor.
that's
correct.
mr.
william
a.allain
if
they
have
--
mr.
william
a.allain
if
they
have
a
right
--
mr.
william
a.allain
your
honor,
it
is
not
really
--
i
hate
to
get
in
rights
because
we've
made
the
distinction
in
our
brief
to
the
court
between
remedies
and
right,
but
let's
forget
about
that
in
this
instance.
if
they
have
some
kind
of
right
to
enforce
section
5,
they
have
another
jurisdictional
statute
which
they
have
alluded
to,
which
they
have
asserted
in
their
complaint
that
they
had
been
denied
some
right
given
to
them
by
congress.
but,
we
are
merely
talking
about
what
did
congress
mean
about
is
that
a
right
under
this
pursuant
to
or
is
it
pursuant
to
a
general
jurisdictional
statute
of
a
right
which
hwas
vested
under
section
5?
mr.
william
a.allain
no,
they
do
not.
mr.
william
a.allain
they
do
not.
mr.
william
a.allain
justice
white
had,
i
think,
assumed
that
they
had
a
right
under
section
5.
mr.
william
a.allain
i
thought
this
question
to
me
was
the
assumption
of
a
right.
mr.
william
a.allain
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
william
a.allain
in
the
action
under,
and
what
we
had
claimed
in
the
--
mr.
william
a.allain
not
in
intent
of
congress
in
the
way
the
language
is
written.
the
jurisdiction
--
mr.
william
a.allain
the
jurisdiction
is
what
we're
speaking
of.
mr.
william
a.allain
it
comes
from
the
general
jurisdiction
statute
which
allows
him
to
seek
injunctive
relief,
i
believe.
mr.
william
a.allain
what
i'm
trying
to
--
mr.
william
a.allain
i'm
--
yes,
your
honor,
but
--
mr.
william
a.allain
right.
mr.
william
a.allain
they're
asking
for
--
mr.
william
a.allain
they
are
asking
for
more.
they
are
asking
for
the
language
that
any
action
brought
under
--
mr.
william
a.allain
essentially,
that's
what
they're
after.
mr.
william
a.allain
with
difference
to
your
honor,
i
do
not
think
that
if
we
found
that
they
had
a
right
existing
or
given
to
them
by
section
5
that
the
action
under
section
5
which
congress
was
referring
to
is
that
action.
i
think
that's
under
the
general
jurisdictional
statute.
mr.
william
a.allain
right.
mr.
william
a.allain
yes,
your
honor,
i
said
it
was
not
--
this
language
did
not
compel
that
reading.
it
was
a
more
appropriate
reading
of
it,
and
with
the
rationale
of
the
swift
case.
i
would
not
say
--
i
stand
before
this
court
and
say
this
court
would
be
way
off
base
if
it
did
so
hold,
but
i
think
our
interpretation
in
the
legislative
history
and
the
type
of
action
talking
about
in
the
three-judge
situation
would
lead
to
the
more
appropriate
reading
which
we
say
should
be
the
reading.
mr.
william
a.allain
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
a.allain
the
legislative
history
is
rather
weak
in
that
particular
--
mr.
william
a.allain
i'm
not
too
sure
of
that,
your
honor.
mr.
william
a.allain
your
honor,
i
do
not
give
a
lot
of
weight
into
the
change
into
the
language.
i
do
not
read
it
and
see
how
it
changes
necessarily
the
reading
of
the
language.
and,
as
we
all
know,
of
course,
somebody
in
congress
might
have
thought,
one,
the
language
might
be
better
to
bring
about
something
and
i
hate
to
get
into
reason
why
somebody
brought
the
language.
mr.
william
a.allain
i
don't
think
the
reading
itself
necessarily
means
that.
mr.
william
a.allain
no,
your
honor,
i
do
not.
mr.
william
a.allain
i
don't
have
no
offsetting
legislative
history.
we
say
that
the
private
parties
lack
standing
for
this
for
this
simple
reason.
i
think
it
showed
and
it's
illustrative
of
what
we've
been
doing
here
today.
the
1965
voting
rights
act
is
more
like
a
jigsaw
picture.
i'd
rather
say
picture
than
puzzle.
and,
it
must
be
read
together
and,
like
a
jigsaw,
when
you
pull
one
piece
of
it
out
and
isolate
it
and
say,
now,
what
does
this
section
say,
that's
when
you
find
yourself
in
trouble.
now,
we
think
the
entire
act,
as
we
said
before,
was
remedies
and
not
rights.
and,
as
this
court
said
in
the
south
carolina
case,
speaking
through
the
chief
justice,
that
this
act
created
new
and
stringent
remedies
that
this
act
and
congress
had
marshaled
an
array
of
weapons
to
be
used
effectively
by
the
united
states,
and
we
feel
that
it
--
mr.
william
a.allain
for
the
purpose,
your
honor,
of,
one,
seeing
that
no
one
is
denied
in
the
future
any
of
their
constitutional
rights
and
to
eradicate
what
rights
have
been
denied
in
the
past.
mr.
william
a.allain
that's
true,
your
honor,
but
the
act
itself,
and
as
your
honor
stated,
the
act
itself,
we're
talking
about
the
fifteenth
amendment.
that
is
where
the
rights
come
from.
south
carolina
--
in
south
carolina,
your
honor
said
that
fifteenth
amendment
is
self-executed,
that
these
people
had
certain
rights
at
that
time.
we
passed
the
1957
voting
rights
act.
we
passed
the
1960
voting
rights
act.
we
passed
something
in
1964
and,
yet,
their
rights
under
the
fifteenth
amendment
had
not
been
vindicated.
so,
what
had
congress
done?
congress
had
created
new
and
stringent
remedies,
not
rights
but
remedies.
mr.
william
a.allain
for
the
vindication,
and
placed
them
on
the
hands
of
what
body?
the
attorney
general.
why?
because
it
is
a
public
interest
we're
talking
about
here
and
not
just
an
individual
interest.
now,
it's
rather
odd
that
the
government
at
this
time
takes
the
position
that
a
private
party
can
bring
a
lawsuit
when,
in
the
apache
county
arizona
case
in
which
we've
cited
in
our
brief
citing
their
brief,
they
say
the
responsibility
--
the
complete
responsibility
rest
with
the
government
and,
in
that
particular
case,
they
tried
to
keep
the
--
some
of
the
indians
of
arizona
from
intervening
because
they
said
"no,
you
don't
have
any
right
in
this
lawsuit."
we
are
vindicating
a
public
right
and,
in
their
brief,
they
took
the
position
that
the
responsibility
rest
in
the
attorney
general
and
they
set
out
as
one
of
the
sections,
section
5.
now,
as
justice
black
said
in
his
dissent
in
regard
to
section
5,
this
is
something
new
in
the
law.
this
is
something
that's
harsh
in
the
law.
and,
as
this
court
said,
it
is
harsh,
but
harsh
means
"when
necessary."
therefore,
we
do
not
believe
that
congress
would've
placed
this
type
of
action,
this
type
of
remedy
in
just
at
the
whim
of
any
individual
who
wanted
to
bring
a
lawsuit
and
say
"now,
look,
you
haven't
gone
up
in
the
attorney
general's
office
first."
look
at
the
ratifications
that
might
come
from
that.
let's
assume
that
we
did
go
to
the
attorney
general's
office.
let's
assume
that
we
went
up
there
with
the
act
itself
and
said
"mr.
attorney
general,
here
is
the
act,
read
it
and
will
you
give
us
a
written
opinion."
and,
he
says
--
he
reads
and
he
says
"that
is
fine,i
have
no
objection
to
it."
i
don't
know
of
any
publication
of
that.
i
don't
know
how
any
citizen
is
going
to
know
about
that,
but
every
citizen
in
mississippi
or
alabama,
virginia,
or
anybody
who
come
within
the
act
can
then
say
"well,
i'm
just
going
to
bring
a
lawsuit
because
i
don't
think
you've
gone
to
the
1965
voting
rights
act."
mr.
william
a.allain
never
hears
of
the
act?
your
honor,
i
think
the
act
--
mr.
william
a.allain
excuse
me.
mr.
william
a.allain
bring
it
to
the
attention
of
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states.
mr.
william
a.allain
by
letter
or,
i
hate
to
say
telephone
conversation
but,
by
any
method
to
relay
to
the
attorney
general's
office.
mr.
william
a.allain
he
could
not
go
to
court
about
it
under
section
5,
your
honor.
he
could
go
to
court
about
it
only
on
the
facts
that
it
was
unconstitutional
under
the
fifteenth
amendment.
mr.
william
a.allain
no,
your
honor,
he
could
not.
mr.
william
a.allain
they
would
not
be
out
of
luck,
your
honor,
because
we
will
have
to
assume
and
congress
assumed
that
the
attorney
general
would
do
his
duty.
they
have
to
assume
that
--
mr.
william
a.allain
we
would've
submitted
it
if
we
felt,
your
honor,
that
it
was
within
the
purview
of
the
1965
voting
rights
act.
but,
getting
back
to
your
honor's
question
of
what
would
the
individual
have
to
do,
he
could
submit
that
to
the
attorney
general's
office
not
for
approval,
don't
get
me
wrong.
mr.
william
a.allain
as
to
the
1965
voting
rights
act
and
to
the
suspension
and
the
submission,
none,
your
honor,
because
that's
not
a
right
of
his.
it's
not
his
--
really
the
right
he's
got
to
do
anything
about
it.
mr.
william
a.allain
well,
your
honor,
there's
a
section
in
the
act
which
says
that
if
a
man
is
denied
the
right
to
vote,
the
action
of
vote
having
counted,
that
he
can
submit
that
to
the
attorney
general
and
the
attorney
general
may
bring
an
action,
and
they
bring
an
action.
mr.
william
a.allain
well,
your
honor,
he
--
mr.
william
a.allain
he
is
without
remedy
to
see
that
the
state
of
mississippi
first
submitted.
this
is
something
new.
it's
not
something
that
he
had
as
under
the
constitution.
it
was
something
congress
came
up
with.
if
congress
wanted
to
limit
who
they
would
allow
to
sue,
that's
congress'
--
mr.
william
a.allain
you
have
a
remedy,
your
honor.
see,
that
phr
--
i
don't
like
to
further
the
right.
mr.
william
a.allain
because
no
right
was
conveyed
upon
him.
mr.
william
a.allain
that
is
the
remedy.
your
honor,
what
i'm
trying
to
say
is
that
it
has
created
no
right
in
the
private
citizen.
the
private
citizen
says
"look,
i
got
a
right
but
got
no
remedy."
the
right
was
created
--
or
the
remedy
was
created
by
congress
and
it
gave
it
to
the
attorney
general.
now,
the
man
standing
over
him
has
not
been
heard
because
we're
not
talking
about
constitutionality
of
the
fifteenth
amendment.
we're
talking
about
a
mere
process
that
congress
felt
was
necessary
to
inform
the
attorney
general.
mr.
william
a.allain
he
can
bring
an
independent
lawsuit,
your
honor,
based
on
that.
mr.
william
a.allain
well,
as
we
said
in
the
court
here
today
that
if
he
gets
--
if
we
extend
the
law,
as
the
appellants
attempt
to
extend
today
--
mr.
william
a.allain
well,
if
--
he
had
a
remedy
in
the
district
court
of
washington,
d.c.
mr.
william
a.allain
if
--
mr.
william
a.allain
sir?
mr.
william
a.allain
i
get
that
from
the
section
which
says
that,
as
far
as
the
declaratory
judgment,
it
must
be
by
the
--
it's
in
section,
i
think,
section
12.
mr.
william
a.allain
you're
right,
sir.
mr.
william
a.allain
that's
my
position
because
its'
not
section
5
that
takes
away
the
authority.
it's
section,
i
think,
section
12
which
says
no
--
or
13,
no
declaratory
judgment
shall
be
entered
except
in
the
washington,
d.c.
court,
but
that
is
talking
strictly
to
section
5
and
section
4.
but,
i
think
we
must
tie
this
--
the
whole
thing
here
that
the
government
themselves
had
stated,
that
the
responsibility
of
enforcing
this
act
is
in
them.
if,
let's
take
on
the
section
4.
we
had
a
tested
advice.
now,
the
act
is
brought
in
washington,
d.c.
you
can't
go
to
the
attorney
general's
office
under
section
4.
you
bring
it
in
washington,
d.c.
you
have
the
burden
of
proving
that
there's
been
no
purpose
of
effect
of
discriminating
the
last
five
years.
there's
no
right
of
intervention
for
a
private
party.
that's
a
position
that
the
attorney
general's
office
took
in
the
apache
county
case.
so,
we
have
here
again
something
that
you
might
say
is
a
remedy,
but
no
right
in
this
private
individual
to
come
in
and
say
"yes,
there
had
been
some
discrimination."
now,
in
the
apache
county
case,
the
district
court
did
allow
an
intervention
but
under
its
inherent
powers,
but
the
attorney
general's
office
took
the
very
opposite
view.
now,
the
next
question,
your
honor,
that
we
come
to
if
the
court
did
not
buy
argument
on
all
this
other
and
felt
the
jurisdiction
lies
here
and
the
private
citizen
does
have
the
right,
we're
talking
about
redistricting,
reapportionment
in
adams
and
forrest
counties.
now,
we
say
the
legislative
history,
the
legislative
intent,
had
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
reapportionment.
we
say
that
the
con
--
the
intent
of
the
act
had
only
to
do
with
things
which
went
directly
to
the
vote
of
the
registration
and
nothing
absolutely
to
do
to
how
a
candidate
shall
be
selected.
now,
here,
they're
talking
about
a
dilution
of
vote.
there'd
been
no
dilution
of
vote
in
this
particular
case.
instead
of
voting
for
one
supervisor,
they
may
go
for
five
supervisors.
the
counties
had
only
done
what
this
court
has
commanded
in
the
avery
case,
to
give
the
vote
to
be
weighed
across
the
board.
now,
we
don't
think
there's
anything
in
the
legislative
history,
in
the
debates,
in
this
case
--
this
court's
decision
in
south
carolina
that
would
ever
say
that
reapportionment
cases
or
redistricting
cases
were
contemplated
under
the
provision
of
section
5
of
the
voting
rights
act.
and,
it's
--
to
look
at
the
hearings
themselves,
and
this
is
merely
what
we
call
a
freezing,
what
we've
got
here
is
a
legislative
freezing.
on
several
occasions,
the
attorney
general
alluded
to
the
fact
that
this
is
nothing
more
than
like
a
reapportionment
case
where
the
court
says
"this
plan
is
wrong,
go
back
and
get
another
plan
and
come
in
here
and
let's
look
at
it,
and
if
we
like
it,
fine,
stamp
of
approval."
but,
nobody
asked
the
next
question,
the
very
next
logical
question,
if
it
were
ever
in
the
minds
of
anybody.
reapportionment
has
been
in
the
minds
of
congress.
they'd
been
trying
to
get
an
act
passed
so
they
can
take
it
out
of
the
court's
hands.
the
next
logical
question
would've
been
"well,
mr.
attorney
general,
does
this
apply
to
reapportionment
cases?"
he
was
talking
about
the
same
type
of
authority,
same
type
of
freezing
principle
and,
yet,
nobody
asked
the
next
logical
question.
why
didn't
they
ask
the
next
logical
question?
because
everybody
in
those
hearings,
the
president
already
knew
that
they
were
not
talking
about
redistricting
and
reapportionment.
that
they
were
talking
about
--
they
would
directly
affect
the
vote.
they
were
talking
about
tests
and
devices
and
then
supplementing
--
i
mean,
putting
something
else
in
that
effect.
we
know
here
that
section
4
and
section
5
are
connected.
section
5
goes
out
of
the
window
once
section
4
is
no
more
applicable.
why?
we're
talking
about
section
--
tests
and
devices
in
section
4,
and
the
same
type
of
thing
they
were
talking
about
in
section
5
was
saying
that
you're
going
to
supplant
for
the
tests
and
devices.
we
say
to
the
court
that
if
this
court
finds
that
this
type
if
actions
come
within
the
purview
of
the
voting
rights
act
of
1950
--
1965,
you
have
almost
started
the
reapportionment,
you
have
taken
out
of
the
district
court
the
right
to
look
at
any
plan
and
approve
that
plan,
and
they
had
placed
in
washington,
d.c.
now,
there
had
been
a
lot
of
talk
here
this
morning
about
"well,
if
you
submit
your
plan,
if
it's
good,
you'll
get
it
approved."
suppose
a
count
--
a
state
doesn't
want
to
submit
the
plan.
suppose
a
county
doesn't
want
to
submit
the
plan.
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
it?
this
would
completely
establish
what
the
reynolds
case
said,
what
the
fourteenth
amendment
case
has
said.
mr.
william
a.allain
you
mean
the
relief
to
be
granted
by
this
court,
your
honor?
mr.
william
a.allain
your
honor,
i
only
used
that
argument
as
to
the
effect
that
i
do
not
believe
that
congress
ever
intended
to
fully
roadblock
or
to
impair
or
put
an
obstacle
in
the
path
of
the
rationale
of
the
reynolds
case
and
avery
versus
midland
texas.
i
think
--
mr.
william
a.allain
i'm
just
posing
that
before
the
court.
mr.
william
a.allain
no,
your
honor.
i
was
suggesting
that
the,
more
or
less,
absurdity
of
the
fact
that
congress,
concerned
with
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
redistricting
will
come
along
here
with
the
1965
voting
rights
act,
had
ever
intend
--
mr.
william
a.allain
that's
right,
your
honor,
if
it
ever
intend
that
that
be
taken
out
of
that
particular
act.
mr.
wells,
your
honor,
will
direct
his
remarks
basically
to
the
cases
which
are
involved.
thank
you.
