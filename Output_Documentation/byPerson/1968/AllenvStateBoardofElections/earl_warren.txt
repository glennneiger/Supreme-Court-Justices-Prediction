mr.
clerk,
this
isn't
listed
very
well.
you'll
have
to
be
satisfied
with
what
i've
given.
we'll
--
who
is
to
address
the
court
first?
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
derfner,
you
may
proceed
with
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
an
uncommon
provision
in
--
throughout
the
states?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
suppose
that
was
under
existing
law.
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
attack
both
the
merits
of
the
situation
as
well
as
the
fact
that
they
should've
gone
to
the
attorney
general,
or
do
you
just
say
they
should've
gone
to
the
attorney
general?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
before
us?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
the
sole
issue
in
the
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
could
be
true.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
lichtman.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
lichtman,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
any
population
relationship
to
these
11
counties
to
the
others?
in
other
words,
are
they
the
11
largest
or
the
11
smallest
or
anything
of
that
kind?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
that
wasn't
the
question
i
asked.
can
it
be
said
that
the
--
that
this
was
done
because
of
the
size
of
the
county,
the
mere
size?
are
these
11
--
do
these
11
happen
to
be
either
the
largest
county
--
11
counties
of
the
state
or
the
smallest
or
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
just
take
control?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
mr.
pollak.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
pollak,
before
you
sit
down,
would
you
mind
telling
us
what
the
extent
of
the
relief
should
be
in
this
case.
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
do
that
for
us
please,
mr.
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
of
course,
serve
it
on
the
other
side.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
mr.
allain.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
want
this
court
to
say
in
any
way
the
information
about
the
act
goes
to
the
attorney
general
from
by
state
by
telephone
or
(inaudible),
that
triggers
the
act
so
far
as
the
attorney
general
is
concerned
or
what
do
you
concede
to
be
the
congress
in
some
protection
kept
the
attention
to
have
somebody
inform
those
from
state
to
the
attorney
general
in
order
to
be
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
not
the
formality
of
it
but
the
informality
which
it
seems
to
have
had,
but
long
to
have
said
"no,
they're
not"
from
something
that's
ordinarily
done
in
litigation
that
that
won't
be
enough
(inaudible).
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
connection
with
that,
what
would
be
--
well,
that
ought
to
be
our
court.
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
other
words,
do
you
want
the
courts
to
determine
whether
the
attorney
general
ask
him
in
a
form
of
advise
to
look
into
collateral
litigation.
i
think,
in
that
time,
we'll
find
out
if
there
was
any
word
to
say
about
speaking
to
the
attorney
general,
that's
when
we're
going
to
have
a
direct
litigation.
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
have
the
impression
that
(inaudible)
you
told
us
about
a
telephone
conversation.
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
which
somebody
in
the
attorney
general's
office
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
somebody
in
the
state
of
mississippi.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and,
do
you
suggest
that
was
sufficient
for
the
likes
of
the
act?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
you
should
recognize
in
our
decisions
that
that
what's
you're
talking
about.
chief
justice
earl
warren
for
what
purpose?
chief
justice
earl
warren
rights,
we
get
back
to
the
rights.
chief
justice
earl
warren
for
the
vindication
of
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
wells.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
page
is
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
can
i
ask
you,
mr.
wells,
what
--
how
did
that
affect
today
this
case
right
at
the
present
time,
the
fact
that
you
refuse
to
acknowledge
that
they
should
go
to
the
attorney
general?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you're
going
to
explain
it
now?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
didn't
they
tell
him
if
you
want
to,
you
could
vote.
of
course,
you've
got
to
give
up
your
position,
so
that's
your
problem?
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
mr.
derfner.
chief
justice
earl
warren
don't
you
think,
mr.
derfner,
that
it's
hard
to
be
pleased
that
there
is
less
reason
for
doing
that
in
this
case
than
in
the
reapportionment
cases
for
several
reasons,
that
in
the
reapportionment
cases,
we
held
that
the
apportionment
was
unconstitutional,
yet
we
gave
them
the
chance
to
direct
it.
in
this
case,
where
all
this
is
asking
is
to
submit
the
procedure,
to
be
submitted
to
the
attorney
general
without
regard
to
whether
it
is
unconstitutional
or
not,
that
it
might
be
better
judgment
to
make
a
fairley
prospective
in
this
case
and,
because
the
attorney
general
might
say
"no,
that's
--
this
is
alright,
there's
no
constitutional
infirmity
here
and,
therefore,
the
election
is
alright."
chief
justice
earl
warren
not
regarded
as
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
didn't
it
say
that?
i
didn't
notice.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
is
it
your
position
then
that
if
we
follow
you,
that
we
remand
this
case
and
require
the
matter
to
be
submitted
to
the
attorney
general,
you're
going
to
call
for
elections?
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
we
order
the
elections
and
the
attorney
general
approved
the
statutes,
then
they'd
be
frustrating
the
mandate,
don't
you
think?
