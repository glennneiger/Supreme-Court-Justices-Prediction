justice
abe
fortas
but
the
virginia
statute
does
try
to
make
an
effort
to
ensure
the
secrecy
of
the
ballot
of
a
write-in
by
an
illiterate,
by
placing
the
judge
who
presumably
goes
into
the
voting
booth
with
the
illiterate
making
it
incumbent
upon
him
to
regard
the
confidentiality
of
what
the
voter
does
and
make
it
a
crime
if
he
doesn't,
isn't
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
was
talking
about
24-251
of
the
virginia
code,
but
your
point
is
that
that
does
not
apply
to
illiterates
--
justice
abe
fortas
to
illiterates,
except
by
virtue
of
the
subsequent
director.
justice
abe
fortas
thank
you.
justice
abe
fortas
excuse
me,
but
i
noticed
in
the
bulletin
sent
to
state
elector,
judges
of
the
election
which,
on
page
15
of
your
brief,
there
is
an
at
least
an
admonition
that
the
judge
of
election
shall
assist
the
voter
upon
his
request
and
shall
not
in
any
manner
divulge
or
indicate
the
name
or
names
of
the
person
for
whom
any
voter
shall
vote.
is
it
your
point
that
there's
no
sanction
behind
that?
justice
abe
fortas
there's
no
--
nothing
provided
in
the
law
to
enforce
that.
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that,
but
i
was
talking
just
about
the
--
this
specific
question.
does
the
--
is
there
anything
in
virginia
law
that
authorizes
the
state
board
elections
to
issue
something
like
this
and
does
that
--
if
there
is,
does
that
provision
in
virginia
law
provide
any
sanction?
justice
abe
fortas
are
you
going
to
address
yourself
to
the
memorandum
filed
by
the
solicitor
general?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
apart
from
that,
what
he
says
is
that,
as
i
understand
it,
is
that
this
is
a
manner
and,
under
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965,
should've
been
first
presented
to
the
attorney
general.
justice
abe
fortas
do
you
challenge
the
--
do
you
contest
the
point
that
that
issue
is
before
us
or
do
you
--
is
it
your
position
that
that
issue
is
not
properly
before
us?
justice
abe
fortas
so,
you
don't
raise
the
jurisdictional
question.
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
but
how
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
however
that
may
be,
the
solicitor
general
suggests
to
this
court
that
the
bulletin
issued
by
the
board
of
elections
constitutes
a
practice
or
procedure
with
respect
to
voting
different
from
that
enforced
or
effect
on
november
1,
1964.
those
were
the
words
of
the
civil
rights
act
and,
therefore,
the
solicitor
urges
that
this
could
not
be
used,
that
that
director
with
the
election
board
could
not
be
used
without
first
being
submitted
to
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia.
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
it
may
be
that
we
have
to
consider
the
point
of
law
that
he
raises
one
way
or
another,
that
is
to
say
whether
this
is
or
is
not,
in
practice
or
procedure
with
respect
to
voting,
different
from
that
enforced
on
november
1,
1964.
and,
if
it
is,
perhaps
we
have
to
consider
whether
its
further
use
should
be
enjoined
pending
the
clearances
provided
by
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965.
justice
abe
fortas
that's
right,
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
it's
the
way
it
puts
it.
justice
abe
fortas
but,
mr.
mcilwaine
--
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
mcilwaine,
maybe
that
question
is
not
before
us.
maybe
we've
got
two
possibilities
before
us.
one
is
to
direct
their
selves
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
requirement
that
the
vote
be
cast
in
the
voter's
own
handwriting.
or
two,
that
we
have
to
consider
whether
the
voting
rights
act
requires
that
this
new
plan,
this
new
arrangement,
be
presented
to
the
attorney
general.
but
--
but,
i
--
it
seems
to
me,
it'd
be
quite
arguable
that
we
cannot
now
reach
the
question
of
the
legality
of
that
alternative
method
if
we
decide
that
the
method
should
have
been
presented
to
the
attorney
general
in
the
first
instance.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
how
if
we
didn't?
i
should
think
we
would
have
to
delay
it,
though,
don't
you
agree?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
derfner,
would
you
mind
speaking
a
little
bit
closer?
justice
abe
fortas
do
you
know
whether
mississippi
submitted
anything
to
the
attorney
general
under
the
statute?
justice
abe
fortas
we
don't
really
have
any
such
case
before
us,
do
we?
the
fairley
case
is
not
the
usual
kind
of
reapportionment
case
because
that
was
a
case
in
which
just
a
selected
number
of
counties
were
involved,
isn't
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
and
it
was
not
--
is
it
stated
that
that
statutory
change
in
the
fairley
case
was
adopted
to
comply
with
any
requirements
of
this
court?
justice
abe
fortas
but
is
there
anything
in
--
justice
abe
fortas
is
there
anything
in
the
legislative
history
of
mississippi
in
the
adoption
of
this
statutory
change
that
would
say
that?
justice
abe
fortas
and,
here,
you
have
only
--
justice
abe
fortas
here,
you
have
only
a
few
counties,
don't
you?
justice
abe
fortas
and,
aren't
there
other
counties
in
mississippi
that
are
divided
into
districts?
justice
abe
fortas
for
this
purpose?
justice
abe
fortas
and
so,
only
a
few
of
them
were
affected
by
this
statutory
change.
justice
abe
fortas
it's
the
state's
contention
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
giving
the
county
to
narrow
it
--
it's
the
state's
contention
anyway,
that
all
the
counties
the
option
to
adopt
this
was
compelled
by
decisions
of
this
court.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
pollak,
are
you
going
to
get
to
the
next
question
that
put
which
is
whether
there
is
a
private
right
of
action?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
suppose
we
don't
agree
with
that
analysis
and
suppose
we
think
that
although
the
right
was
conferred
by
section
5
upon
the
individual,
the
individual
has
to
look
elsewhere
for
his
cause
of
action.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
let's
say
it's
a
question.
would
he
then
have
to
bring
in
before
the
one-judge
court
if,
as
i
take
it
to
be,
situation
here
is
also
challenging
the
constitutionality
of
a
state
statute?
at
least
that's
still
in
one
of
these
cases.
justice
abe
fortas
sir?
justice
abe
fortas
it's
sort
of
pending
jurisdiction,
isn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
no.
justice
abe
fortas
i
see.
justice
abe
fortas
so,
there,
they
have
to
derive
the
three-judge
court
provision
from
the
four
corners
of
section
5.
justice
abe
fortas
because,
you
could
say
that
section
5
gives
the
petitioners
in
25
and
26
a
right
of
action.
it
gives
them
a
right,
but
that
right
--
then,
it
would
follow
--
it
might
follow
that
that
right
would
have
to
be
vindicated
before
a
single
judge
--
justice
abe
fortas
except
for
the
language
you
point
to
in
section
5,
is
that
it?
justice
abe
fortas
who
submitted
that?
i'd
like
to
see
--
justice
abe
fortas
but
if
you
take
the
position
that
this
changes
have
been
submitted
to
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
by
or
on
behalf
of
mississippi,
then
i
take
it
you're
not
going
to
get
anything
to
argue
about
here
as
--
let
us
say,
you
can't
do
that
and
still
say
that
the
act
does
not
apply,
can
you?
justice
abe
fortas
do
you
agree
that
the
act
covers
the
various
alleged
tests
and
devices
that
are
in
issue
in
these
cases?
justice
abe
fortas
and,
therefore,
you
don't
agree
that
they'd
been
submitted
to
the
attorney
general,
do
you?
justice
abe
fortas
do
you
or
do
you
not?
justice
abe
fortas
do
you
or
do
you
not?
justice
abe
fortas
alright.
justice
abe
fortas
it
was
submitted
by
the
clerk
of
this
court.
is
that
what
you
mean?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
the
united
states
suggested
to
us
that
the
language
as
originally
drafted
said
such
action,
which
would
seem
to
refer
to
the
action
brought
in
the
district
of
columbia
and
that
was
later
changed,
according
to
the
united
states,
to
any
action
under
this
section.
do
you
have
any
observation
on
that?
justice
abe
fortas
but
you
don't
have
--
justice
abe
fortas
you
don't
have
any
offsetting
--
justice
abe
fortas
legislative
history.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
what
do
you
suggest
we
do
about
it?
supposing
that
this
court
holds
that
for
your
opponent
here,
and
suppose
that
it
is
--
this
court
should
decide
that
the
statute
commands
it
to
be
incumbent
upon
the
state
to
submit
these
plans
and
suppose
the
state
doesn't
do
it.
is
that
what
you're
putting
up
test,
really?
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
i'm
asking
if
you're
really
suggesting
to
us
a
state
of
facts
in
which
this
court
holds
that
the
congress
required
that
these
matters
at
issue
in
this
cases
be
submitted
to
the
attorney
general.
are
you
really
asking
us
what
happens
if
the
state
doesn't
comply?
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
but
i
just
thought
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
just
want
to
make
sure
that
you
are
not
suggesting
that
we
have
to
consider
what
happens
if
the
state
does
not
comply
with
our
decree.
justice
abe
fortas
you're
talking
about
that
one
trick
in
the
case.
justice
abe
fortas
republicans
have
constitutional
rights,
too,
don't
they?
justice
abe
fortas
may
i
ask
you
if
there's
another
way
of
getting
at
it
that
a
possible
directive
might
be
that,
unless
the
state
chooses
to
submit
the
matter
to
the
attorney
general
or
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia
and
unless,
after
such
submission,
a
favorable
response
is
given
to
the
state
by
the
attorney
general
or
the
courts,
then,
in
that
event,
the
district
court
shall
order
new
election.
justice
abe
fortas
is
down
to?
justice
abe
fortas
no?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
know,
but
you're
raising
questions
to
whether
we
should,
in
effect,
as
a
penalty
for
what
arguably
is
a
state
action
here,
compel
the
state
to
go
to
the
attorney
general
rather
than
to
pursue
what
is
a
statutory
alternative,
namely
to
go
to
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia.
justice
abe
fortas
but
the
virginia
statute
does
try
to
make
an
effort
to
ensure
the
secrecy

divided
into
districts?
justice
abe
fortas
for
this
purpose?
justice
abe
fortas
and
so,
only
a
few
of
them
were
affected
by
this
statutory
change.
justice
abe
fortas
it's
the
state's
contention
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
giving
the
county
to
narrow
it
--
it's
the
state's
contention
anyway,
that
all
the
counties
the
option
to
adopt
this
was
compelled
by
decisions
of
this
court.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
pollak,
are
you
going
to
get
to
the
next
question
that
put
which
is
whether
there
is
a
private
right
of
action?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
suppose
we
don't
agree
with
that
analysis
and
suppose
we
think
that
although
the
right
was
conferred
by
section
5
upon
the
individual,
the
individual
has
to
look
elsewhere
for
his
cause
of
action.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
let's
say
it's
a
question.
would
he
then
have
to
bring
in
before
the
one-judge
court
if,
as
i
take
it
to
be,
situation
here
is
also
challenging
the
constitutionality
of
a
state
statute?
at
least
that's
still
in
one
of
these
cases.
justice
abe
fortas
sir?
justice
abe
fortas
it's
sort
of
pending
jurisdiction,
isn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
no.
justice
abe
fortas
i
see.
justice
abe
fortas
so,
there,
they
have
to
derive
the
three-judge
court
provision
from
the
four
corners
of
section
5.
justice
abe
fortas
because,
you
could
say
that
section
5
gives
the
petitioners
in
25
and
26
a
right
of
action.
it
gives
them
a
right,
but
that
right
--
then,
it
would
follow
--
it
might
follow
that
that
right
would
have
to
be
vindicated
before
a
single
judge
--
justice
abe
fortas
except
for
the
language
you
point
to
in
section
5,
is
that
it?
justice
abe
fortas
who
submitted
that?
i'd
like
to
see
--
justice
abe
fortas
but
if
you
take
the
position
that
this
changes
have
been
submitted
to
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
by
or
on
behalf
of
mississippi,
then
i
take
it
you're
not
going
to
get
anything
to
argue
about
here
as
--
let
us
say,
you
can't
do
that
and
still
say
that
the
act
does
not
apply,
can
you?
justice
abe
fortas
do
you
agree
that
the
act
covers
the
various
alleged
tests
and
devices
that
are
in
issue
in
these
cases?
justice
abe
fortas
and,
therefore,
you
don't
agree
that
they'd
been
submitted
to
the
attorney
general,
do
you?
justice
abe
fortas
do
you
or
do
you
not?
justice
abe
fortas
do
you
or
do
you
not?
justice
abe
fortas
alright.
justice
abe
fortas
it
was
submitted
by
the
clerk
of
this
court.
is
that
what
you
mean?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
the
united
states
suggested
to
us
that
the
language
as
originally
drafted
said
such
action,
which
would
seem
to
refer
to
the
action
brought
in
the
district
of
columbia
and
that
was
later
changed,
according
to
the
united
states,
to
any
action
under
this
section.
do
you
have
any
observation
on
that?
justice
abe
fortas
but
you
don't
have
--
justice
abe
fortas
you
don't
have
any
offsetting
--
justice
abe
fortas
legislative
history.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
what
do
you
suggest
we
do
about
it?
supposing
that
this
court
holds
that
for
your
opponent
here,
and
suppose
that
it
is
--
this
court
should
decide
that
the
statute
commands
it
to
be
incumbent
upon
the
state
to
submit
these
plans
and
suppose
the
state
doesn't
do
it.
is
that
what
you're
putting
up
test,
really?
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
i'm
asking
if
you're
really
suggesting
to
us
a
state
of
facts
in
which
this
court
holds
that
the
congress
required
that
these
matters
at
issue
in
this
cases
be
submitted
to
the
attorney
general.
are
you
really
asking
us
what
happens
if
the
state
doesn't
comply?
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
but
i
just
thought
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
just
want
to
make
sure
that
you
are
not
suggesting
that
we
have
to
consider
what
happens
if
the
state
does
not
comply
with
our
decree.
justice
abe
fortas
you're
talking
about
that
one
trick
in
the
case.
justice
abe
fortas
republicans
have
constitutional
rights,
too,
don't
they?
justice
abe
fortas
may
i
ask
you
if
there's
another
way
of
getting
at
it
that
a
possible
directive
might
be
that,
unless
the
state
chooses
to
submit
the
matter
to
the
attorney
general
or
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia
and
unless,
after
such
submission,
a
favorable
response
is
given
to
the
state
by
the
attorney
general
or
the
courts,
then,
in
that
event,
the
district
court
shall
order
new
election.
justice
abe
fortas
is
down
to?
justice
abe
fortas
no?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
know,
but
you're
raising
questions
to
whether
we
should,
in
effect,
as
a
penalty
for
what
arguably
is
a
state
action
here,
compel
the
state
to
go
to
the
attorney
general
rather
than
to
pursue
what
is
a
statutory
alternative,
namely
to
go
to
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia.
