justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
tell
me,
mr.
mcilwaine,
what
do
you
think
is
before
us
for
decision
in
this
case,
not
what
the
plain
--
what
the
appellant
urges
or
what
the
solicitor
general
has
suggested,
but
what
do
you
think
is
before
us
for
decision?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
or
you
haven't
quite
phrased,
or
have
you,
that
--
is
that
the
way
we're
going
to
read
the
question
as
you
submitted
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
have
it
as
the
section
as
implemented
by
the
regulations
violated
the
fourteenth
amendment
or
the
voting
rights
act.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but,
i
gather,
your
thought
that
the
question
only
of
use
of
stickers
be
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
being
before
us,
that
isn't
necessarily
to
only
in
the
case
of
illiterates
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
taking
my
view
by
some
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
you
suggesting
that
they
perpetuate
if
a
district
court
in
mississippi
directed
a
reapportionment
plan
that
could
not
be
made
effective
until
it
clears
the
attorney
general
or
the
district
of
columbia
district
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
not
speaking
--
i'm
speaking
not
of
a
reapportionment
plan
enacted
by
the
mississippi
legislature
than
the
absence
of
one
of
a
reapportionment
plan
directed
by
a
mississippi
district
court.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
even
that
one,
you
say,
will
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
let's
see
though.
if
--
let's
assume
a
legislature
legislatively
adopt
a
plan
of
mississippi,
a
challenge
to
it
in
the
federal
district
court
in
mississippi
ultimately,
let's
assume,
an
approval
of
the
plan.
suppose
it's
then
taken
directly
here,
a
three-judge
court
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
by
the
three-judge
district
court.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
comes
here
and
we
affirm
it.
now,
you
say,
nevertheless,
mississippi
can't
make
it
effective.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
without
going
to
the
attorney
general
for
his
approval
and
thereafter,
if
he
denied
it,
getting
a
declaratory
judgment
from
the
district
court
of
the
district
of
columbia,
then
comes
to
the
court
of
appeals,
and
then
back
to
us?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and,
therefore,
what?
do
we
set
aside
those
elections
in
1967?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
the
congress
didn't
look
--
the
congress
didn't
say
the
new
law
was
bad,
may
i
suggest.
what
the
congress
said
was
this
state
law
shall
not
be
effective
unless
such
and
such
is
done.
isn't
that
what
congress
said?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
if
that's
so,
whether
or
not
the
attorney
general
approves
or
disapproves,
whether
or
not
--
if
the
attorney
general
disapproves,
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia
is
valid.
nevertheless,
there
was
no
state
law
in
effect
on
the
date
of
the
selection.was
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then
i
don't
understand
how,
under
any
submission
you
make,
you
can
take
any
position
other
than
that
there
was
no
valid
election
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
november
1967.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
because
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
because
there
was
no
law.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
the
old
law
may
be,
but
the
law
with
--
under
which
r
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
new
law
could
not
be
given
by
force
of
congressional
enactment
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
any
effect
by
the
state
whatsoever.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
isn't
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
that
congressional
enactment
of
section
5
is
constitutional.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
either
case
where
there's
--
the
state
goes
directly
to
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia
or
after
refusal
of
the
attorney
general
to
approve
the
legislation.
was
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia
a
three-judge
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
either
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
then
do
what,
appeal
that
record
from
that
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
we
don't
involve
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
let
me
get
this
clear
then,
mr.
pollak.
in
one
of
these
cases
we
have
a
fifteenth
amendment
claim,
don't
we?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you
don't
--
you're
not
suggesting
that.
as
i
now
understand
your
answer
to
mr.
justice
white,
that
the
fact
of
that
challenge
invokes
the
three-judge
court
provision
in
it
of
itself.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words,
there's
no
statute.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and,
therefore,
there
is
no
place
for
the
invocation
on
that
ground
of
a
three-judge
court.
therefore,
that
does
come
down,
doesn't
it,
that
you
have
to
find
in
that
case
the
justification
for
the
three-judge
court
within
the
four
corners
of
section
5?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
so,
you
say
there
should
be
a
three-judge
court
in
any
of
these
cases.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
under
section
5?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
forgetting
right,
do
they
have
a
cause
of
action
which
arises
under
section
5?
does
the
individual
get
the
word
"right?"
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they
do
not
at
all?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then,
it
wouldn't
matter
whether
it
was
a
single-judge
or
a
three-judge
court.
how
could
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
jurisdictional
statutes
don't
create
cause
of
action.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
really,
what
they're
asking,
as
i
understand,
you've
isolated
this
to
the
single
question.
they're
asking
that
it
be
adjudicated
that
section
5
covers
these
mississippi
statutes.
so,
it's
a
question
of
coverage
within
or
under
section
5,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
isn't
it
practically
what
--
that's
what
they're
after.
they
want
the
court
to
say
that
these
mississippi
statutes
come
within
the
purview
of
section
5.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
that's
true
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why
is
it
that
the
voting
rights
covers
section
5?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
essentially,
isn't
that
what
they're
after?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
what
this
lawsuit
is
all
about
and
whether
or
not
it
is
obvious
to
the
court
is
certainly,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
there
are
meetings
there.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
right
that
the
congress
didn't
say
any
action
under
section
5.
it's
limited
only
to
an
act
that's
brought
into
court,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
nevertheless,
it
certainly
is
arguable
if
their
cause
of
action,
namely
where
mississippi
is
practically
covered
under
section
5,
it's
an
act
under
section
5,
that
congress
said
any
action
under
section
5
that's
brought
into
court.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
legislative
history
for
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
because
i've
forgotten
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
it
doesn't
appear
that
it
came
in,
in
connection
with
some
adamant
versions
only
to
the
district
of
columbia
course
of
action,
does
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
wells,
isn't
that
at
least
a
burden
upon
one's
primary
election
vote?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know,
isn't
--
it
says
here
if
you
--
you
don't
have
to
--
you
can
vote
in
a
primary
election
or
not
but
if
you
vote
in
a
primary
election,
then
you
may
not
stand
for
office
as
an
independent
candidate
for
any
office.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now,
isn't
that
at
least
a
qualification
upon
one's
right
to
vote
as
freely
as
he
want
to
--
wishes
in
a
primary
election
because
you'd
have
to
stop
and
think
"i
better
not
vote
in
this
primary
election
because
if
i
do,
now
i
can't
be
an
independent
candidate
for
office."
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
isn't
it,
mr.
wells,
to
that
extent
at
least?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i'm
only
looking
at
what
you
have
in
the
stipulation.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
just
--
would
you
mind?
in
--
so
far,
isn't
that
at
least
on
the
face
of
it,
a
burden
on
the
right
to
vote
in
the
primary?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
if
it
is,
isn't
it
then
a
standard
practice
of
procedure
with
respect
to
voting
different
from
that
enforced
or
in
effect
on
november
1,
1964?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
why
doesn't
that
automatically
then
bring
it
within
the
coverage
of
section
5?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know
it
doesn't,
but
i
don't
read
the
statute,
mr.
wells,
as
dealing
with
prohibitions
from
voting.
it's
only
whether
or
not
a
given
standard
practice
of
procedure
with
respect
to
voting
is
different
from
the
enforced
or
in
effect
on
november
1,
1964,
and
i'm
just
suggesting
if
there
was
no
such
burden
on
the
right
to
vote
in
the
primary
election
on
november
1,
1964,
and
it
seems
to
me
the
new
statute
imposes
a
different
standard
than
that
in
effect
on
november
1,
1964.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
it
may
be
that
your
legislature
intended
to
affect
his
right
to
run
for
office,
but
if
the
device
they
choose
to
affect
his
right
to
run
for
office
is
to
burden
his
vote
in
a
primary
election,
then
i
find
it
hard
to
see
how
that
doesn't
come
within
the
coverage
of
and
the
purview
of
section
5.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
just
ask
you,
mr.
wells,
i
take
it,
to
the
extent
that
this
problems
of
reapportionment
in
any
of
these
cases,
bunton
doesn't
raise
it,
does
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
when
you
changed
from
an
election
to
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but,
i
mean,
when
you
--
a
statute
that
changes
from
an
election
--
elective
methods
to
an
appointive
method,
wouldn't
that
be
an
appor
--
a
reapportionment
statute?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
of
three?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
tell
me,
mr.
mcilwaine,

and,
therefore,
what?
do

now,

whether

let

in

of
these
cases
we
have
a
fifteenth
amendment
claim,
don't
we?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you
don't
--
you're
not
suggesting
that.
as
i
now
understand
your
answer
to
mr.
justice
white,
that
the
fact
of
that
challenge
invokes
the
three-judge
court
provision
in
it
of
itself.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words,
there's
no
statute.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and,
therefore,
there
is
no
place
for
the
invocation
on
that
ground
of
a
three-judge
court.
therefore,
that
does
come
down,
doesn't
it,
that
you
have
to
find
in
that
case
the
justification
for
the
three-judge
court
within
the
four
corners
of
section
5?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
so,
you
say
there
should
be
a
three-judge
court
in
any
of
these
cases.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
under
section
5?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
forgetting
right,
do
they
have
a
cause
of
action
which
arises
under
section
5?
does
the
individual
get
the
word
"right?"
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they
do
not
at
all?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then,
it
wouldn't
matter
whether
it
was
a
single-judge
or
a
three-judge
court.
how
could
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
jurisdictional
statutes
don't
create
cause
of
action.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
really,
what
they're
asking,
as
i
understand,
you've
isolated
this
to
the
single
question.
they're
asking
that
it
be
adjudicated
that
section
5
covers
these
mississippi
statutes.
so,
it's
a
question
of
coverage
within
or
under
section
5,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
isn't
it
practically
what
--
that's
what
they're
after.
they
want
the
court
to
say
that
these
mississippi
statutes
come
within
the
purview
of
section
5.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
that's
true
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why
is
it
that
the
voting
rights
covers
section
5?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
essentially,
isn't
that
what
they're
after?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
what
this
lawsuit
is
all
about
and
whether
or
not
it
is
obvious
to
the
court
is
certainly,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
there
are
meetings
there.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
right
that
the
congress
didn't
say
any
action
under
section
5.
it's
limited
only
to
an
act
that's
brought
into
court,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
nevertheless,
it
certainly
is
arguable
if
their
cause
of
action,
namely
where
mississippi
is
practically
covered
under
section
5,
it's
an
act
under
section
5,
that
congress
said
any
action
under
section
5
that's
brought
into
court.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
legislative
history
for
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
because
i've
forgotten
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
it
doesn't
appear
that
it
came
in,
in
connection
with
some
adamant
versions
only
to
the
district
of
columbia
course
of
action,
does
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
wells,
isn't
that
at
least
a
burden
upon
one's
primary
election
vote?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know,
isn't
--
it
says
here
if
you
--
you
don't
have
to
--
you
can
vote
in
a
primary
election
or
not
but
if
you
vote
in
a
primary
election,
then
you
may
not
stand
for
office
as
an
independent
candidate
for
any
office.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now,
isn't
that
at
least
a
qualification
upon
one's
right
to
vote
as
freely
as
he
want
to
--
wishes
in
a
primary
election
because
you'd
have
to
stop
and
think
"i
better
not
vote
in
this
primary
election
because
if
i
do,
now
i
can't
be
an
independent
candidate
for
office."
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
isn't
it,
mr.
wells,
to
that
extent
at
least?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i'm
only
looking
at
what
you
have
in
the
stipulation.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
just
--
would
you
mind?
in
--
so
far,
isn't
that
at
least
on
the
face
of
it,
a
burden
on
the
right
to
vote
in
the
primary?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
if
it
is,
isn't
it
then
a
standard
practice
of
procedure
with
respect
to
voting
different
from
that
enforced
or
in
effect
on
november
1,
1964?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
why
doesn't
that
automatically
then
bring
it
within
the
coverage
of
section
5?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know
it
doesn't,
but
i
don't
read
the
statute,
mr.
wells,
as
dealing
with
prohibitions
from
voting.
it's
only
whether
or
not
a
given
standard
practice
of
procedure
with
respect
to
voting
is
different
from
the
enforced
or
in
effect
on
november
1,
1964,
and
i'm
just
suggesting
if
there
was
no
such
burden
on
the
right
to
vote
in
the
primary
election
on
november
1,
1964,
and
it
seems
to
me
the
new
statute
imposes
a
different
standard
than
that
in
effect
on
november
1,
1964.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
it
may
be
that
your
legislature
intended
to
affect
his
right
to
run
for
office,
but
if
the
device
they
choose
to
affect
his
right
to
run
for
office
is
to
burden
his
vote
in
a
primary
election,
then
i
find
it
hard
to
see
how
that
doesn't
come
within
the
coverage
of
and
the
purview
of
section
5.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
just
ask
you,
mr.
wells,
i
take
it,
to
the
extent
that
this
problems
of
reapportionment
in
any
of
these
cases,
bunton
doesn't
raise
it,
does
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
when
you
changed
from
an
election
to
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but,
i
mean,
when
you
--
a
statute
that
changes
from
an
election
--
elective
methods
to
an
appointive
method,
wouldn't
that
be
an
appor
--
a
reapportionment
statute?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
of
three?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
