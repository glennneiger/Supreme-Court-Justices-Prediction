mr.
will
s.wells
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
first
matter
i
want
to
discuss
is
number
36,
if
the
court
please,
the
whitley
case.
this
case
was
originally
brought
challenging
the
amendment
of
the
section
involved
on
two
grounds,
one,
that
it
was
unconstitutional
and
the
other
was
that
it
was
in
violation
of
section
5.
the
constitutional
issue
was
completely
take
out
of
the
case
in
its
entirety
by
stipulation.
i
believe
mr.
justice
marshall
asked
counsel
this
morning,
first,
why
he
took
it
out
and
he
said
that
he
took
it
out
at
that
time
because
we
were
trying
to
get
a
--
for
a
decision.
the
present
counsel
was
not
a
member
of
counsel
at
the
time
this
matter
was
brought
in
court
at
that
time.
i
handled
it
from
its
conception.
the
stipulation
was
entered
into
at
the
request
of
williams
himself
and
was
actually
drawn
by
plaintiff's
counsel
at
that
time.
mr.
derfner
came
along
after
all
matters
were
passed.
we
did
not,
so
the
only
question
here,
as
i
see
in
this
case
is
this.
does
this
statute
come
within
the
purview
of
section
5
of
the
voting
rights
act?
it
was
not
submitted
to
the
attorney
general
nor
was
it
submitted
to
the
court
of
the
district
of
columbia
because
we
did
not
feel
that
it
came
within
the
purview
of
the
act
or
required
to
be.
and,
the
court
might
note,
in
the
stipulation
which
is
found
on
pages
38
and
39
of
the
appendix
in
number
36.
i
was
willing
to
stipulate
with
counsel
that
the
state
of
mississippi
in
enacting
house
bill
68,
mississippi
laws
of
1966,
which
amended
the
section
3260
of
mississippi
code,
did
not
comply
with
the
provisions
of
42
usc
1973
(c)
which
is
title
5.
it
has
not
been
submitted
to
the
attorney
general
or
to
the
district
of
columbia.
this
is
not
to
be
construed
as
a
concession
by
the
defendants
that
the
state
of
mississippi
was
any
--
under
any
lawful
obligation
to
so
comply
with
the
provisions
of
that
section.
mr.
will
s.wells
that's
on
--
at
the
bottom
of
page
38
in
appendix
a
of
the
appendix
of
number
36.
in
other
words,
we
took
that
position
from
the
start.
now,
in
going
--
mr.
will
s.wells
if
the
court
please,
i've
taken
this
issues
i
go
through
to
explain
why
i
do
not
think
it
did.
mr.
will
s.wells
yes,
sir.
mr.
will
s.wells
in
the
hearings
--
in
all
the
hearings,
if
the
court
please,
before
congress,
everything
was
talked
about
was
voting,
people's
rights
to
vote,
to
register
to
vote.
the
only
place
that
i
can
find,
after
a
complete
reading
of
every
--
the
congressional
records,
all
of
the
hearings
both
in
the
senate
and
in
the
house,
and
in
the
debates
on
the
floor,
and
i
read
them
all,
the
only
place
we
find
anything
said
about
candidates
running
for
office
as
against
a
person's
right
to
vote
for
office,
which
is
cited
in
appellee's
brief
in
number
36
at
pages
10
and
11,
we
find
this
and
it's
found
in
page
74
of
the
hearing
before
the
subcommittee
number
5
of
the
committee
on
judicial
and
the
house
of
representatives
of
the
89th
congress.
mr.
corman,
he
was
talking
to
mr.
burke
marshall
who,
at
that
time,
was
an
assistant
attorney
general
and
one
of
the
chief
architects
of
this
very
civil
rights
act
which
was
brought
as
a
matter
of
common
knowledge
at
the
recommendation
and
at
the
request
of
the
president
of
the
united
states,
as
he
told
the
joint
session
of
congress.
we
find
this,
mr.
corman,
we
have
not
talked
at
all
about
whether
we
have
to
be
concerned
with
not
only
who
can
vote
but
who
can
run
for
public
office,
and
that
has
been
an
issue
in
so
many
years
in
south
in
1964.
had
you
given
any
consideration
to
whether
or
not
this
bill
ought
to
address
itself
to
the
qualifications
for
running
for
public
office
as
well
as
the
problem
of
registration?
mr.
marshall,
the
problem
that
the
bill
was
aimed
at
was
the
problem
of
registration.
congress
--
if
there
is
a
problem
of
another
sort,
i
would
like
to
see
it
corrected,
but
that
is
not
what
we
were
trying
to
deal
with
in
this
bill.
and,
nowhere
else
have
i
been
able
to
find
any
sort
of
discussion
that
would
indicate
any
other
different
questions.
now,
section
3260
which
has
been
amended
sets
different
qualifications
for
people
running
for
office.
they
raise
the
number
of
signatures
that
a
candidate
has
to
have
on
petition
running
for
a
statewide
office
from
1,000
to
10,000
at
a
time,
and
in
answer
to
the
chief
justice's
questions
this
morning,
when
there
was
an
excess
of
650,000
registered
voters
in
mississippi.
it
provided
further
that
because
it
had
been
invited
by
the
supreme
court
of
mississippi,
it
has
called
attention
in
the
court's
opinion
in
this
case
at
an
earlier
time
where
a
man
had
run
--
had
taken
part
in
a
primary
election
and
then
run
as
an
independent,
and
the
court
said
he
had
a
right
to
do
that
as
a
candidate
because
there
was
no
statute
against
it,
it
would
have
to
be
done
by
legislature.
so,
they
provided
what?
if
you
vote
in
a
primary
election
that's
going
to
nominate
candidates
to
run
for
office,
you've
got
the
right
to
run
in
that
primary
if
you
want
to
again.
but,
if
you
vote
in
that
primary,
then
you
yourself
can't
qualify
as
an
independent
candidate
in
the
general
election.
you're
trying
to
beat
the
very
man
that
--
mr.
will
s.wells
no,
sir.
it's
a
burden
upon
a
c
--
mr.
will
s.wells
at
the
ensuing
elections.
mr.
will
s.wells
if
the
court
please
--
mr.
will
s.wells
let's
take
the
rest
of
the
statute,
if
the
court
please,
uncoupled
with
it.
mr.
will
s.wells
alright,
sir.
now,
let's
take
the
rest
of
the
statute.
mr.
will
s.wells
it's
a
burden
on
his
individual
right
to
vote.
mr.
will
s.wells
for
that
individual?
it
would
be
different
if
for
that
individual
is
concerned,
yes,
sir.
mr.
will
s.wells
if
the
court
please,
it
doesn't
prohibit
him
from
voting.
mr.
will
s.wells
if
the
court
please,
i
don't
think
it
goes
that
far.
i
think
it
does
--
it
affects
his
right
to
run
for
office.
it
affects
his
right
to
run
for
office,
yes,
sir,
but
not
his
right
to
vote.
mr.
will
s.wells
if
the
court
please,
i
don't
view
it,
in
all
efforts
to
your
honor,
in
that
vein.
i
think
it
has
affected
his
right
to
run
for
office,
yes,
sir,
but
it
hadn't
change
the
standard
of
his
right
to
vote
originally
in
the
primary
election.
mr.
will
s.wells
if
you're
going
to
vote
in
the
primary
election
and
take
part,
this
is
not
in
the
record
and,
if
the
court
please,
might
be
interesting
in
one
which
counsel
has
drawn
to.
i
happen
to
know
the
reason
for
part
of
that
which
is
not
in
the
record
and
it
was
trying
to
keep
republicans
from
getting
out
the
democratic
primary
support
in
the
weakest
man
and
then
running
until
somebody
gets
him
in
the
general
election.
that
was
what
was
happening,
and
that's
actually
what
brought
about
the
statute.
if
the
court
is
interested,
they've
had
no
racial
view
at
all,
but
that
had
been
happening.
anyway,
deliberately,
they
said
"let's
get
together.
he's
the
weakest
man
in
that
race
and
let's
for
him
in
the
primary
and
then
run
somebody
against
him
in
the
general
election."
if
they
had
the
chance
to
beating
him,
they
would.
that's
the
case.
mr.
will
s.wells
yes,
sir,
they
do,
and
i
want
to
say,
quite
frankly,
that
i
think
that
this
election
is
going
to
show
they're
also
a
little
bit
farther
than
they
were.
now,
if
the
court
please,
we
go
to
then
--
the
other
legislative
history
in
this
matter.
all
through
it
out,
which
is
set
up
in
our
brief,
everything
the
whole
colloquy
is
talking
about
through
this
thing
is
the
right
to
vote,
the
right
to
vote,
the
right
to
vote,
the
right
to
register
to
vote.
the
right
to
run
for
office?
no.
that's
the
distinction
that
we
make
as
far
as
this
case
is
concerned.
now,
as
to
the
bunton
ballot
case
which
has
to
do
with
the
appointing
of
superintendents
of
education,
i
can
say
to
the
court
quite
frankly
and
quite
honestly
that
that
has
given
me
quite
a
lot
of
concern.
mr.
will
s.wells
no,
sir.
mr.
will
s.wells
no,
sir.
here's
what
bunton
does
in
this
case
--
mr.
will
s.wells
not
whatsoever.
here's
the
situation,
if
the
court
please.
first,
i
call
the
court's
attention,
in
those
cases,
you
haven't
got
the
three
counties
involved.
although
they
allude
to
11,
you've
got
only
representatives
of
the
class
with
3
counties.
mr.
will
s.wells
yes,
sir.
mr.
will
s.wells
leflore,
jefferson,
and
holmes.
the
pleadings
themselves
say
we
have
registered
voters
in
jefferson
county
who
desire
to
run
for
superintended
of
education
in
jefferson
county.
we
bring
this
suit
on
behalf
of
ourselves
and
the
class
of
all
other
voters
and
potential
candidates
in
jefferson
county,
the
other
suit
says
in
claiborne
county,
the
other
suit
says
in
holmes
county.
they
don't
even
attempt
to
represent
the
class
in
any
counties
except
those.
mr.
will
s.wells
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
will
s.wells
in
mississippi?
mr.
will
s.wells
82,
sir.
mr.
will
s.wells
yes,
sir.
mr.
will
s.wells
how
many
are
covered
by
this
statute?
11,
i
believe,
if
the
court
please.
i
think
it's
11.
mr.
will
s.wells
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
cannot
answer
that
to
save
my
life,
except
to
suggest
this.
the
statute
originally
provided
where
the
matter
could
be
presented
to
a
vote
of
the
people
to
determine
where
that
would
be
done
and
if
an
election
was
held
and
they
voted
that
it
could
be
done.
somebody
comes
along
and
doesn't
want
to
go
through
that
to
his
county
and
introduces
an
amendment
to
amend
it
and
provided
that,
in
my
county,
it
will
be
automatic
and
somebody
else
says
"well,
i
want
to
get
included
too,"
and
that's
the
way
those
things
go.
mr.
will
s.wells
if
the
court
please,
if
i
had
been
a
member
of
the
legislature,
i've
never
voted
for
it.
if
it
so
happens
that
the
legislature
acts
very
independently
of
the
attorney
general
and,
quite
often,
not
in
conformity
with,
sometimes,
our
recommendations.
i
frankly
must
say
that
it
is
a
closed
question.
in
my
opinion,
of
course,
the
constitutionality
of
that
is
not
involved.
it's
a
question
of
whether
or
not
he'd
conform
to
that.
i'm
frank
to
say
that
if
this
court
finds
that
this
three-judge
court
was
promptly
convened
and
had
jurisdiction
to
determine
that
question
in
those
cases.
it
is
a
closed
question
in
my
mind
and
i
cannot,
and
will
not,
insist
that
i
think
that
those
--
that
statute
or
those
statutes
do
not
come
within
the
purview
of
section
5.
now,
i
as
--
i
take
a
complete
honest
position
with
the
court
and
that
case
there
has
given
me
con
--
some
concern
for
these
reasons,
it
takes
somebody's
right
to
vote
away
from
him,
removes
him
from
the
voting
right,
and
i
think
this.
i
think
if
it
were
attacked
on
constitutional
grounds
as
if
racing
ahead
and
they
had
left
that
in
the
case
before
the
court
on
the
basis
of
the
unconstitutional
ground
or
i
think
that
that
statute
is
in
violation
of
mississippi's
own
law.
i
think
it's
local
and
private
legislation
attempted
to
have
been
enacted
under
a
general
statute
and
i
think
if
it
were
attacked
in
the
mississippi
courts,
it
would
be
stricken
down
in
the
state
courts.
i
think
they
had
a
complete
bran
--
an
actual
remedy.
they
go
right
into
state
court
and
the
courts
would've
held
it
--
would've
stricken
down
on
the
grounds
that
it's
local
and
private
legislation
attempted
to
be
enacted
as
a
general
statute
right
in
the
face
of
the
constitution.
mr.
will
s.wells
it's
entirely
irrelevant
to
the
issue
in
this
court
and
if
the
court
please
and
i'm
saying
to
this
court,
quite
frankly
and
quite
honestly,
that
it
is
a
much
closer
question
as
to
whether
it
comes
under
the
section
5
--
mr.
will
s.wells
in
my
opinion,
that
either
the
whitley
case
or
the
other,
and
i
am
not
going
to
say
to
this
court
and
urge
this
court
to
say
that
i
take
the
absolute
position
that
it
does.
it's
in
the
area
there.
i
do
think
that,
in
the
whitley
case
that,
that
section
has
to
do
with
candidates,
what
else
about
candidates,
and
i
do
not
believe
it
is
within
the
purview
of
section
5,
honest
about
--
i'm
very
frank
about
that.
and,
if
the
court
please,
i
--
unless
there
are
some
questions
that
the
court
wants,
i
think
the
rest
of
the
matter
has
been
covered.
mr.
will
s.wells
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
first
matter
i
want
to
discuss
is
number
36,
if
the
court
please,
the
whitley
case.
this
case
was
originally
brought
challenging
the
amendment
of
the
section
involved
on
two
grounds,
one,
that
it
was
unconstitutional
and
the
other
was
that
it
was
in
violation
of
section
5.
the
constitutional
issue
was
completely
take
out
of
the
case
in
its
entirety
by
stipulation.
i
believe
mr.
justice
marshall
asked
counsel
this
morning,
first,
why
he
took
it
out
and
he
said
that
he
took
it
out
at
that
time
because
we
were
trying
to
get
a
--
for
a
decision.
the
present
counsel
was
not
a
member
of
counsel
at
the
time
this
matter
was
brought
in
court
at
that
time.
i
handled
it
from
its
conception.
the
stipulation
was
entered
into
at
the
request
of
williams
himself
and
was
actually
drawn
by
plaintiff's
counsel
at
that
time.
mr.
derfner
came
along
after
all
matters
were
passed.
we
did
not,
so
the
only
question
here,
as
i
see
in
this
case
is
this.
does
this
statute
come
within
the
purview
of
section
5
of
the
voting
rights
act?
it
was
not
submitted
to
the
attorney
general
nor
was
it
submitted
to
the
court
of
the
district
of
columbia
because
we
did
not
feel
that
it
came
within
the
purview
of
the
act
or
required
to
be.
and,
the
court
might
note,
in
the
stipulation
which
is
found
on
pages
38
and
39
of
the
appendix
in
number
36.
i
was
willing
to
stipulate
with
counsel
that
the
state
of
mississippi
in
enacting
house
bill
68,
mississippi
laws
of
1966,
which
amended
the
section
3260
of
mississippi
code,
did
not
comply
with
the
provisions
of
42

(c)
which
is
title
5.
it
has
not
been
submitted
to
the
attorney
general
or
to
the
district
of
columbia.
this
is
not
to
be
construed
as
a
concession
by
the
defendants
that
the
state
of
mississippi
was
any
--
under
any
lawful
obligation
to
so
comply
with
the
provisions
of
that
section.
mr.
will
s.wells
that's
on
--
at
the
bottom
of
page
38
in
appendix
a
of
the
appendix
of
number
36.
in
other
words,
we
took
that
position
from
the
start.
now,
in
going
--
mr.
will
s.wells
if
the
court
please,
i've
taken
this
issues
i
go
through
to
explain
why
i
do
not
think
it
did.
mr.
will
s.wells
yes,
sir.
mr.
will
s.wells
in
the
hearings
--
in
all
the
hearings,
if
the
court
please,
before
congress,
everything
was
talked
about
was
voting,
people's
rights
to
vote,
to
register
to
vote.
the
only
place
that
i
can
find,
after
a
complete
reading
of
every
--
the
congressional
records,
all
of
the
hearings
both
in
the
senate
and
in
the
house,
and
in
the
debates
on
the
floor,
and
i
read
them
all,
the
only
place
we
find
anything
said
about
candidates
running
for
office
as
against
a
person's
right
to
vote
for
office,
which
is
cited
in
appellee's
brief
in
number
36
at
pages
10
and
11,
we
find
this
and
it's
found
in
page
74
of
the
hearing
before
the
subcommittee
number
5
of
the
committee
on
judicial
and
the
house
of
representatives
of
the
89th
congress.
mr.
corman,
he
was
talking
to
mr.
burke
marshall
who,
at
that
time,
was
an
assistant
attorney
general
and
one
of
the
chief
architects
of
this
very
civil
rights
act
which
was
brought
as
a
matter
of
common
knowledge
at
the
recommendation
and
at
the
request
of
the
president
of
the
united
states,
as
he
told
the
joint
session
of
congress.
we
find
this,
mr.
corman,
we
have
not
talked
at
all
about
whether
we
have
to
be
concerned
with
not
only
who
can
vote
but
who
can
run
for
public
office,
and
that
has
been
an
issue
in
so
many
years
in
south
in
1964.
had
you
given
any
consideration
to
whether
or
not
this
bill
ought
to
address
itself
to
the
qualifications
for
running
for
public
office
as
well
as
the
problem
of
registration?
mr.
marshall,
the
problem
that
the
bill
was
aimed
at
was
the
problem
of
registration.
congress
--
if
there
is
a
problem
of
another
sort,
i
would
like
to
see
it
corrected,
but
that
is
not
what
we
were
trying
to
deal
with
in
this
bill.
and,
nowhere
else
have
i
been
able
to
find
any
sort
of
discussion
that
would
indicate
any
other
different
questions.
now,
section
3260
which
has
been
amended
sets
different
qualifications
for
people
running
for
office.
they
raise
the
number
of
signatures
that
a
candidate
has
to
have
on
petition
running
for
a
statewide
office
from
1,000
to
10,000
at
a
time,
and
in
answer
to
the
chief
justice's
questions
this
morning,
when
there
was
an
excess
of
650,000
registered
voters
in
mississippi.
it
provided
further
that
because
it
had
been
invited
by
the
supreme
court
of
mississippi,
it
has
called
attention
in
the
court's
opinion
in
this
case
at
an
earlier
time
where
a
man
had
run
--
had
taken
part
in
a
primary
election
and
then
run
as
an
independent,
and
the
court
said
he
had
a
right
to
do
that
as
a
candidate
because
there
was
no
statute
against
it,
it
would
have
to
be
done
by
legislature.
so,
they
provided
what?
if
you
vote
in
a
primary
election
that's
going
to
nominate
candidates
to
run
for
office,
you've
got
the
right
to
run
in
that
primary
if
you
want
to
again.
but,
if
you
vote
in
that
primary,
then
you
yourself
can't
qualify
as
an
independent
candidate
in
the
general
election.
you're
trying
to
beat
the
very
man
that
--
mr.
will
s.wells
no,
sir.
it's
a
burden
upon
a
c
--
mr.
will
s.wells
at
the
ensuing
elections.
mr.
will
s.wells
if
the
court
please
--
mr.
will
s.wells
let's
take
the
rest
of
the
statute,
if
the
court
please,
uncoupled
with
it.
mr.
will
s.wells
alright,
sir.
now,
let's
take
the
rest
of
the
statute.
mr.
will
s.wells
it's
a
burden
on
his
individual
right
to
vote.
mr.
will
s.wells
for
that
individual?
it
would
be
different
if
for
that
individual
is
concerned,
yes,
sir.
mr.
will
s.wells
if
the
court
please,
it
doesn't
prohibit
him
from
voting.
mr.
will
s.wells
if
the
court
please,
i
don't
think
it
goes
that
far.
i
think
it
does
--
it
affects
his
right
to
run
for
office.
it
affects
his
right
to
run
for
office,
yes,
sir,
but
not
his
right
to
vote.
mr.
will
s.wells
if
the
court
please,
i
don't
view
it,
in
all
efforts
to
your
honor,
in
that
vein.
i
think
it
has
affected
his
right
to
run
for
office,
yes,
sir,
but
it
hadn't
change
the
standard
of
his
right
to
vote
originally
in
the
primary
election.
mr.
will
s.wells
if
you're
going
to
vote
in
the
primary
election
and
take
part,
this
is
not
in
the
record
and,
if
the
court
please,
might
be
interesting
in
one
which
counsel
has
drawn
to.
i
happen
to
know
the
reason
for
part
of
that
which
is
not
in
the
record
and
it
was
trying
to
keep
republicans
from
getting
out
the
democratic
primary
support
in
the
weakest
man
and
then
running
until
somebody
gets
him
in
the
general
election.
that
was
what
was
happening,
and
that's
actually
what
brought
about
the
statute.
if
the
court
is
interested,
they've
had
no
racial
view
at
all,
but
that
had
been
happening.
anyway,
deliberately,
they
said
"let's
get
together.
he's
the
weakest
man
in
that
race
and
let's
for
him
in
the
primary
and
then
run
somebody
against
him
in
the
general
election."
if
they
had
the
chance
to
beating
him,
they
would.
that's
the
case.
mr.
will
s.wells
yes,
sir,
they
do,
and
i
want
to
say,
quite
frankly,
that
i
think
that
this
election
is
going
to
show
they're
also
a
little
bit
farther
than
they
were.
now,
if
the
court
please,
we
go
to
then
--
the
other
legislative
history
in
this
matter.
all
through
it
out,
which
is
set
up
in
our
brief,
everything
the
whole
colloquy
is
talking
about
through
this
thing
is
the
right
to
vote,
the
right
to
vote,
the
right
to
vote,
the
right
to
register
to
vote.
the
right
to
run
for
office?
no.
that's
the
distinction
that
we
make
as
far
as
this
case
is
concerned.
now,
as
to
the
bunton
ballot
case
which
has
to
do
with
the
appointing
of
superintendents
of
education,
i
can
say
to
the
court
quite
frankly
and
quite
honestly
that
that
has
given
me
quite
a
lot
of
concern.
mr.
will
s.wells
no,
sir.
mr.
will
s.wells
no,
sir.
here's
what
bunton
does
in
this
case
--
mr.
will
s.wells
not
whatsoever.
here's
the
situation,
if
the
court
please.
first,
i
call
the
court's
attention,
in
those
cases,
you
haven't
got
the
three
counties
involved.
although
they
allude
to
11,
you've
got
only
representatives
of
the
class
with
3
counties.
mr.
will
s.wells
yes,
sir.
mr.
will
s.wells
leflore,
jefferson,
and
holmes.
the
pleadings
themselves
say
we
have
registered
voters
in
jefferson
county
who
desire
to
run
for
superintended
of
education
in
jefferson
county.
we
bring
this
suit
on
behalf
of
ourselves
and
the
class
of
all
other
voters
and
potential
candidates
in
jefferson
county,
the
other
suit
says
in
claiborne
county,
the
other
suit
says
in
holmes
county.
they
don't
even
attempt
to
represent
the
class
in
any
counties
except
those.
mr.
will
s.wells
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
will
s.wells
in
mississippi?
mr.
will
s.wells
82,
sir.
mr.
will
s.wells
yes,
sir.
mr.
will
s.wells
how
many
are
covered
by
this
statute?
11,
i
believe,
if
the
court
please.
i
think
it's
11.
mr.
will
s.wells
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
cannot
answer
that
to
save
my
life,
except
to
suggest
this.
the
statute
originally
provided
where
the
matter
could
be
presented
to
a
vote
of
the
people
to
determine
where
that
would
be
done
and
if
an
election
was
held
and
they
voted
that
it
could
be
done.
somebody
comes
along
and
doesn't
want
to
go
through
that
to
his
county
and
introduces
an
amendment
to
amend
it
and
provided
that,
in
my
county,
it
will
be
automatic
and
somebody
else
says
"well,
i
want
to
get
included
too,"
and
that's
the
way
those
things
go.
mr.
will
s.wells
if
the
court
please,
if
i
had
been
a
member
of
the
legislature,
i've
never
voted
for
it.
if
it
so
happens
that
the
legislature
acts
very
independently
of
the
attorney
general
and,
quite
often,
not
in
conformity
with,
sometimes,
our
recommendations.
i
frankly
must
say
that
it
is
a
closed
question.
in
my
opinion,
of
course,
the
constitutionality
of
that
is
not
involved.
it's
a
question
of
whether
or
not
he'd
conform
to
that.
i'm
frank
to
say
that
if
this
court
finds
that
this
three-judge
court
was
promptly
convened
and
had
jurisdiction
to
determine
that
question
in
those
cases.
it
is
a
closed
question
in
my
mind
and
i
cannot,
and
will
not,
insist
that
i
think
that
those
--
that
statute
or
those
statutes
do
not
come
within
the
purview
of
section
5.
now,
i
as
--
i
take
a
complete
honest
position
with
the
court
and
that
case
there
has
given
me
con
--
some
concern
for
these
reasons,
it
takes
somebody's
right
to
vote
away
from
him,
removes
him
from
the
voting
right,
and
i
think
this.
i
think
if
it
were
attacked
on
constitutional
grounds
as
if
racing
ahead
and
they
had
left
that
in
the
case
before
the
court
on
the
basis
of
the
unconstitutional
ground
or
i
think
that
that
statute
is
in
violation
of
mississippi's
own
law.
i
think
it's
local
and
private
legislation
attempted
to
have
been
enacted
under
a
general
statute
and
i
think
if
it
were
attacked
in
the
mississippi
courts,
it
would
be
stricken
down
in
the
state
courts.
i
think
they
had
a
complete
bran
--
an
actual
remedy.
they
go
right
into
state
court
and
the
courts
would've
held
it
--
would've
stricken
down
on
the
grounds
that
it's
local
and
private
legislation
attempted
to
be
enacted
as
a
general
statute
right
in
the
face
of
the
constitution.
mr.
will
s.wells
it's
entirely
irrelevant
to
the
issue
in
this
court
and
if
the
court
please
and
i'm
saying
to
this
court,
quite
frankly
and
quite
honestly,
that
it
is
a
much
closer
question
as
to
whether
it
comes
under
the
section
5
--
mr.
will
s.wells
in
my
opinion,
that
either
the
whitley
case
or
the
other,
and
i
am
not
going
to
say
to
this
court
and
urge
this
court
to
say
that
i
take
the
absolute
position
that
it
does.
it's
in
the
area
there.
i
do
think
that,
in
the
whitley
case
that,
that
section
has
to
do
with
candidates,
what
else
about
candidates,
and
i
do
not
believe
it
is
within
the
purview
of
section
5,
honest
about
--
i'm
very
frank
about
that.
and,
if
the
court
please,
i
--
unless
there
are
some
questions
that
the
court
wants,
i
think
the
rest
of
the
matter
has
been
covered.
