wrong
in
thinking
that
the
precise
issue
we
got
before
us
is
to
the
scope
of
the
provision
of
the
statute
which
refers
to
qualifications
and
prerequisites
to
voting
or
standards
and
practices
and
procedure?
justice
john

it's
a
question
of
the
interpretation
of
the
coverage
of
that
provision.
justice
john
m.
harlan
your
argument,
so
far,
seems
to
go
to
the
merits
of
this
statute.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
do
you
contend
the
statute
covers?
justice
john
m.
harlan
would
it
encompass
things
in
your
view
that
would
not
be
unconstitutional
in
the
fifteenth
amendment?
justice
john
m.
harlan
why
doesn't
it
cover
quality
of
cases
too?
justice
john
m.
harlan
why
doesn't
it
cover
the
quality
of

a
man
who
runs
in
the
ballot
no
longer
votes.
justice
john
m.

isn't
that
right?
justice

according
to
the
law
that
went
across
the
board,
in

mississippi
had
said
they

going

an
appointed
system.
the

justice
john

that
would've
been
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
agree
the
statue
isn't
worded
that
broadly.
justice
john
m.
harlan
because
what
congress
had
in
mind
was
reverted
as
you
say
so.
justice
john
m.

well,
isn't
the
attorney
general
simply
an
option
of
the
states
to
short-circuit
litigation
if
they
can
get
his
approval?
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
a
question
just
beyond
that
in
your
view
in
adams
and
forrest
counties.
do
you
think
that
the
measure
of
a
device
and
the
constitutionality
is
in
the
court
now,
are
you
saying
that?
justice
john
m.

you
do?

john

and
the
