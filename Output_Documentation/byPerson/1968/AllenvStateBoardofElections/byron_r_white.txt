justice
byron
r.
white
except,
that
you
treat
the
blind
differently
from
the
illiterate.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
the
equal
protection
clause
was
a
substantial
question
in
this
case
or
do
you
--
are
you
objecting
the
jurisdiction
of
the
three-judge
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
of
the
protection.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
there
was
a
substantial
equal
protection
clau
--
claim
stated
to
convene
a
three-judge
court
for?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
only
issue
in
lower
court
was
the
validity
of
the
statute
requiring
handwriting?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
was
section
4
of
the
voting
rights
act
involved
in
the
lower
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
was
suspended.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
there
still
isn't.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
that
was
a
suspended
test.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
statute
then
was
suspended?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
if
the
virginia
had
put
out
a
regulation
that
illiterates
may
hereafter
vote
and
they
may
vote
by
a
sticker
but
no
other
way,
you
would
say
that's
implementing
the
voting
rights
act
and
would
not
need
to
have
been
submitted
to
the
attorney
general.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
the
only
alternative
to
that
would
be
that
somebody
should
have
authority
meanwhile
to
prescribe
some
way
for
illiterates
to
vote.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
any
district
court
might
be
able
to
do
better
than
these
authorities.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
pending
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean,
mr.
mcilwaine,
that
if
it's
something
that
must
be
submitted
to
the
attorney
general,
then
there's
nothing
any
court
can
do
meanwhile
to
permit
illiterates
to
vote.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
i'm
assum
--
justice
byron
r.
white
in
the
district
of
columbia.
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
the
60-das
submission
a
prerequisite
to
the
lawsuit
or
are
they
alternatives?
justice
byron
r.
white
alternatives?
justice
byron
r.
white
sticker
voting
is
not
permitted?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
but
the
question
--
i
take
it,
you
say
that
it's
the
same
question
if
you
put
it
this
way,
that
the
question
is
whether
or
not
it's
unconstitutional
for
virginia
to
permit
illiterates
to
vote
with
the
help
of
election
officials.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
think
they're
the
same
question.
justice
byron
r.
white
was
turning
the
opposition
before
you
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
mr.
derfner,
what
is
--
the
prohibition
is
against
running
as
an
independent,
if
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
have
voted
in
the
primary?
justice
byron
r.
white
not
if
you
ran
in
the
primary,
but
--
justice
byron
r.
white
a
good
faith
literacy
test
itself
would
not
be,
in
it
of
itself,
violate
the
fifteenth
amendment.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
held
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
yet,
obviously,
would
come
under
section
5,
wouldn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
addressed
you
as
to
what
specifically
is
the
sweep
of
the
act.
a
fine
question
has
to
go
to
a
district
of
columbia
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
whether
it
violates
the
constitution.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
would
be
reapportionment
of
the
provision.
justice
byron
r.
white
all
reapportionment
cases
--
the
constitutionality
of
all
the
reapportionment
statutes
must
be
submitted,
is
that
so?
justice
byron
r.
white
which
one
would?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
alright,
all
--
justice
byron
r.
white
all
the
reapportionment
cases
from
the
covered
states
would
have
the
constitutionality
passed
upon
by
district
of
columbia
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
by
the
attorney
general.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
where
does
--
where
--
what
words
in
the
act
do
you
think
cover
your
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
with
respect
to
voting?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
a
little
hard.
justice
byron
r.
white
are
they
in
the
majority
in
any
other
counties?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
it
very
relevant
in
this?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference
what
the
racial
makeup
was
in
terms
of
the
statute.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
be
making
the
same
argument
if
mississippi
just
revealed
this
law
now,
would
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
may
not
--
the
question
of
court
made
plans.
justice
byron
r.
white
but,
legislative
plans
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
--
justice
byron
r.
white
we're
necessarily
deciding
this
one.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
has
the
district
of
columbia
court
then
got
jurisdiction
to
pass
on
new
apportionment
plans
in
the
covered
states?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
think
the
jurisdiction
of
all
the
other
district
courts
have
been
--
justice
byron
r.
white
or
the
district
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
isn't
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
not
asking
us
to
pass
on
the
validity.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
pollak,
why
should
--
if
there's
a
private
action
before
a
single
judge,
why
shouldn't
the
question
be
limited
to
just
whether
or
not
the
statute
that's
in
question
is
covered
by
section
5,
and
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
because,
otherwise,
aren't
you
really
--
doesn't
the
act
contemplate
that
the
validity
of
the
statute
be
passed
upon
by
the
attorney
general
or
the
district
of
columbia
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
let's
assume
that
in
this
c
--
in
one
of
these
cases
that
in
a
federal
district
court
in
mississippi
the
plaintiffs
ask
that
the
statute
be
declared
unconstitutional.
do
you
think
the
district
judge
should
dismiss
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
so.
justice
byron
r.
white
no.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
state
statute.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that,
any
new
state
laws
are
unattackable
on
constitutional
grounds
in
any
district
--
in
any
of
the
covered
states
of
the
federal
district
courts.
justice
byron
r.
white
then
why
should
the
federal
court
--
i
would
agree
that
if
--
that
if
the
attorney
general
approves
a
statute
or
60
days
went
by
and
he
didn't
approve
it,
i
would
think
that
some
citizen
could
still
nevertheless
challenge
it
but,
until
it's
approved
or
60
days
has
gone
by
or
it's
approved,
then
there
isn't
any
statute
at
all,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
then,
how
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
the
court
should
dismiss
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
of
anything
that
the
attorney
general
says
in
the
case
that
he
either
approves
or
disapproves
these
laws?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
this
case
can't
be
moot
unless
you
lose
it
first.
justice
byron
r.
white
of
course,
this
is
on
the
assumption
that
the
section
5
applies
to
these
changes.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
want
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
assume
that
if
what
you
--
if
we
accepted
your
argument
that
the
attorney
general
really
has
been
informed
and
60
days
had
gone
by,
then
the
plaintiffs
are
in
shape
to
challenge
these
laws
directly
in
the
district
court
for
constitutionality.
justice
byron
r.
white
once
the
attorney
general
has
approved
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say,
in
effect,
he
has.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
60
days
go
by.
justice
byron
r.
white
on
the
act.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
do
you
waste
your
time
on
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
we'll
never
get
to
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
we'll
never
get
to
the
merits.
justice
byron
r.
white
but,
it
seems
to
me
that
if
there's
a
private
right
of
action
to
determine
coverage
in
the
first
place,
it's
either
going
to
be
under
section
5
or
it
isn't
going
to
be
anywhere,
isn't
it?
i
mean,
the
right
of
these
parties
to
be
in
court
at
all
to
determine
the
coverage
of
section
5.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
--
their
right
either
arises
from
section
5
or
it
doesn't
exist.
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
either
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
don't
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
care
what
words
you
use.
i
just
want
to
know
whether
--
what
dose
section
5
say,
any
action
under
this
section?
justice
byron
r.
white
will
be
heard
by
a
three-judge
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
alright,
now,
i'll
just
--
if
this
action
isn't
--
is
auth
--
if
these
people
can
stay
in
court
at
all
with
this
cause
of
action,
is
it
an
action
under
section
5?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
will
they
get
into
court
at
all
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
where
does
their
cause
of
action
come
from
though?
justice
byron
r.
white
heavens,
no.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
there's
any
analogy,
as
you
know,
in
many
reapportionment
cases
where
the
court
has
thought
that
there
was
malapportionment
that
an
election
was
coming
up.
the
court
has
sanctioned
the
conduct
of
the
election,
although
under
a
malapportioned
system
because
of
the
difficulty
of
getting
things
corrected
before
the
election
came
along.
we
did
that,
didn't
we,
in
several
cases?
justice
byron
r.
white
don't
you
suppose
there's
something
--
here,
you
have
situations
which
are
now
passed.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
the
court
dist
it.
the
court
didn't
--
we're
faced
with
a
fact,
not
a
theory
as
to
saying
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i'm
just
wondering
over
my
question
to
you
was,
don't
you
see
any
analogy
at
all,
mr.
derfner,
in
what
we've
done
in
the
reapportionment
cases?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
think
we
should
do
that
and
we
should
order
the
district
court
to
restore
the
status
quo
as
quickly
as
can
be,
is
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
which,
necessarily
involves,
i
suppose,
the
ousting
of
the
present
encumbrance
and
new
elections
under
the
old
laws,
is
it
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
except,
that
you
treat
the
blind
differently
from
the
illiterate.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
the
equal
protection
clause
was
a
substantial
question
in
this
case
or
do
you
--
are
you
objecting
the
jurisdiction
of
the
three-judge
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
of
the
protection.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
there
was
a
substantial
equal
protection
clau
--
claim
stated
to
convene
a
three-judge
court
for?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
only
issue
in
lower
court
was
the
validity
of
the
statute
requiring
handwriting?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
was
section
4
of
the
voting
rights
act
involved
in
the
lower
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
was
suspended.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
there
still
isn't.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
that
was
a
suspended
test.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
statute
then
was
suspended?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
if
the
virginia

justice
byron
r.
white
or
the
district
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
isn't
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
not
asking
us
to
pass
on
the
validity.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
pollak,
why
should
--
if
there's
a
private
action
before
a
single
judge,
why
shouldn't
the
question
be
limited
to
just
whether
or
not
the
statute
that's
in
question
is
covered
by
section
5,
and
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
because,
otherwise,
aren't
you
really
--
doesn't
the
act
contemplate
that
the
validity
of
the
statute
be
passed
upon
by
the
attorney
general
or
the
district
of
columbia
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
let's
assume
that
in
this
c
--
in
one
of
these
cases
that
in
a
federal
district
court
in
mississippi
the
plaintiffs
ask
that
the
statute
be
declared
unconstitutional.
do
you
think
the
district
judge
should
dismiss
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
so.
justice
byron
r.
white
no.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
state
statute.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that,
any
new
state
laws
are
unattackable
on
constitutional
grounds
in
any
district
--
in
any
of
the
covered
states
of
the
federal
district
courts.
justice
byron
r.
white
then
why
should
the
federal
court
--
i
would
agree
that
if
--
that
if
the
attorney
general
approves
a
statute
or
60
days
went
by
and
he
didn't
approve
it,
i
would
think
that
some
citizen
could
still
nevertheless
challenge
it
but,
until
it's
approved
or
60
days
has
gone
by
or
it's
approved,
then
there
isn't
any
statute
at
all,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
then,
how
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
the
court
should
dismiss
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
of
anything
that
the
attorney
general
says
in
the
case
that
he
either
approves
or
disapproves
these
laws?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
this
case
can't
be
moot
unless
you
lose
it
first.
justice
byron
r.
white
of
course,
this
is
on
the
assumption
that
the
section
5
applies
to
these
changes.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
want
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
assume
that
if
what
you
--
if
we
accepted
your
argument
that
the
attorney
general
really
has
been
informed
and
60
days
had
gone
by,
then
the
plaintiffs
are
in
shape
to
challenge
these
laws
directly
in
the
district
court
for
constitutionality.
justice
byron
r.
white
once
the
attorney
general
has
approved
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say,
in
effect,
he
has.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
60
days
go
by.
justice
byron
r.
white
on
the
act.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
do
you
waste
your
time
on
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
we'll
never
get
to
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
we'll
never
get
to
the
merits.
justice
byron
r.
white
but,
it
seems
to
me
that
if
there's
a
private
right
of
action
to
determine
coverage
in
the
first
place,
it's
either
going
to
be
under
section
5
or
it
isn't
going
to
be
anywhere,
isn't
it?
i
mean,
the
right
of
these
parties
to
be
in
court
at
all
to
determine
the
coverage
of
section
5.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
--
their
right
either
arises
from
section
5
or
it
doesn't
exist.
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
either
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
don't
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
care
what
words
you
use.
i
just
want
to
know
whether
--
what
dose
section
5
say,
any
action
under
this
section?
justice
byron
r.
white
will
be
heard
by
a
three-judge
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
alright,
now,
i'll
just
--
if
this
action
isn't
--
is
auth
--
if
these
people
can
stay
in
court
at
all
with
this
cause
of
action,
is
it
an
action
under
section
5?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
will
they
get
into
court
at
all
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
where
does
their
cause
of
action
come
from
though?
justice
byron
r.
white
heavens,
no.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
there's
any
analogy,
as
you
know,
in
many
reapportionment
cases
where
the
court
has
thought
that
there
was
malapportionment
that
an
election
was
coming
up.
the
court
has
sanctioned
the
conduct
of
the
election,
although
under
a
malapportioned
system
because
of
the
difficulty
of
getting
things
corrected
before
the
election
came
along.
we
did
that,
didn't
we,
in
several
cases?
justice
byron
r.
white
don't
you
suppose
there's
something
--
here,
you
have
situations
which
are
now
passed.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
the
court
dist
it.
the
court
didn't
--
we're
faced
with
a
fact,
not
a
theory
as
to
saying
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i'm
just
wondering
over
my
question
to
you
was,
don't
you
see
any
analogy
at
all,
mr.
derfner,
in
what
we've
done
in
the
reapportionment
cases?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
think
we
should
do
that
and
we
should
order
the
district
court
to
restore
the
status
quo
as
quickly
as
can
be,
is
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
which,
necessarily
involves,
i
suppose,
the
ousting
of
the
present
encumbrance
and
new
elections
under
the
old
laws,
is
it
not?
