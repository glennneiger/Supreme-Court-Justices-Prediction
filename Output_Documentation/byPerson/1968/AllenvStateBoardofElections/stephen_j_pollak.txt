mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
this
morning
is
a
statutory
interpretation
one.
it
involves
the
responsibilities
of
the
states
and
the
rights
of
citizens
under
section
5
of
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965.
as
has
already
been
presented
before
the
court,
the
major
and
overwriting
issue
is
whether
failure
to
comply
with
the
procedures
of
section
5
precluded
enforcement
of
the
changed
laws
concerning
the
election
of
county
supervisors,
the
appointment
of
county
civil
school
superintendents,
and
the
requirements
for
qualification
of
independent
candidates.
the
argument
thus
far
has
focused
on
one
of
four
issues,
which
the
appellees
have
projected
in
the
case
in
which
we
believe
are
in
the
case.
i'd
like
to
state
them
and
i'm
prepared
to
present
argument
on
each
of
them.
the
first
is
whether
section
5
is
limited
to
the
qualifications
for
registration
to
vote
or
whether
it
reaches
beyond
that
scope
to
cover
changes
which
affect
voting
and
may
violate
the
fifteenth
amendment.
the
second
issue,
not
yet
discussed,
is
whether,
where
a
state
fails
to
comply
with
the
procedures
of
section
5,
a
person
whose
vote
is
affected
has
a
private
right
of
action
to
seek
to
enjoin
the
enforcement
of
that
changed
law.
the
third
issue
is
whether,
if
such
a
private
right
of
action
is
authorized
by
section
5,
it
must
be
bought
--
brought
as
the
suits
here
were
brought
before
three-judge
courts.
and,
the
last
issue
is
whether
these
appeals
are
mooted
because
when
the
clerk
of
this
court
requested
the
attorney
general
for
his
views
on
march
11
of
this
year.
he
gave
the
attorney
general
notice
of
the
changes
and
the
attorney
general
has
not
made
formal
objection,
or
at
least
that
is
how
the
issue
is
stated
in
the
appellees'
briefs.
i
believe
the
facts
of
these
cases
bear
witness
to
the
prophetic
vision
of
the
congress
in
enacting
the
voting
rights
act.
it
was
concerned,
as
the
reports
of
the
committees
and
the
debates
indicate,
that
once
the
barriers
to
registration
were
down,
the
states
covered
by
the
voting
rights
act
might
resort,
as
they
had
resorted
through
previous
100
years
to
other
statutes
to
preclude
effective
votes
by
negros.
the
voting
rights
act
was
essentially
a
statute
which,
one,
suspended
literacy
tests
and
devices
which
had
been
used
to
discriminate
and,
two,
has
had
the
courts
in
the
previous
few
years
sought
to
freeze
the
presently
existing
statutes
so
that
when
the
literacy
tests
were
out
of
the
way
and
negros
were
able
to
register,
those
then
existing
statutes
would
remain
in
effect
until
the
attorney
general
or
a
court
of
three
judges
and,
in
turn,
this
court
had
reviewed
the
change
to
determine
that
the
change
was
not
a
violation
of
the
fifteenth
amendment.
it
did
not
put
any
final
powers
in
the
attorney
general,
as
we
read
it.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
i
didn't
hear
the
first
words
of
your
question,
sir.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
the
court
of
three
judges
of
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia.
it
was
logged
in
a
court
and
the
only
role
of
the
attorney
general,
there
is
no
requirement
as
we
read
the
--
section
5,
that
the
state
must
make
a
submission
to
the
attorney
general.
it
may
move
to
the
three-judge
court
immediately
after
--
when
it
wishes
to
enact
or
enforce
a
changed
law.
the
only
provision
for
the
attorney
general
is
that
if
the
state
believes
that
it
has
a
change
which
is
not
violative
of
the
fifteenth
amendment
and
wishes
to
move
through
this
procedure
established
by
section
5
faster
than
it
believes
it
can
move
to
the
district
court,
it
may
submit
it
to
the
attorney
general.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
it
--
we
read
it
to
require
a
three-judge
court,
and
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
in
either
case.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
it
would
be,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
no,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
i
believe
that
the
decision
of
this
court
in
south
carolina
validated
the
constitutionality
of
section
5.
i
believe
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
i
believe
the
first
issue
that
is
--
we've
--
i
articulated
this
morning,
the
scope
of
section
5,
is
still
open
for
this
court
to
rule
in
this
case.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
your
honor,
the
court
had
section
5
before
it,
in
that,
a
south
carolina
statute
changing
the
hours
of
voting
from
6:00
in
the
evening
to
7:00
in
the
evening
was
presented
and
the
attorney
general
adverted
to
it
in
the
course
of
the
argument.
the
court
makes
reference
to
that
change
in
its
opinion
in
a
foot
--
in
the
text
and
also
in
a
footnote
on
page
320.
it
also
makes
the
statement
there
are
indication
in
the
record
that
other
sections
the
country
listed
above
have
also
altered
their
voting
laws
since
november
1,
1964,
but
the
court
did
not
have
before
it
the
procedures
which
would
be
followed
by
the
attorney
general
or
beyond
that
by
the
court
if
there
were
any
unusual
procedures.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
your
honor,
i
believe
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
i
believe
the
court
did
make
this
holding,
not
that
--
i
want
to
say
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
i
want
to
stay
away
from
a
statement
or
an
argument
that
the
court
held
that
if
the
attorney
general
said
it
was
bad,
i
believe
those
were
your
honor's
words
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
the
point
that
the
court
ruled
upon
was
this,
and
i
believe
it
did
hold
this.
the
act
suspends
new
voting
regulations,
pending
scrutiny
by
federal
authorities
to
depend
to
determine
whether
their
use
would
violate
the
fifteenth
amendment.
i
believe
that
the
voting
rights
act,
as
i've
used
the
word
before,
froze
the
laws
at
the
time
it
was
passed
or
as
of
november
1,
1964.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
it
froze
those
laws
and
said
if
the
state
wished
to
change
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
no,
the
act.
congress
of
the
united
states
froze
it.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
no,
i
don't
believe
--
i
believe
what
the
scheme
of
the
act,
and
i'm
prepared
to
advert
to
the
legislative
history
which
i
think
is
relevant,
but
the
scheme
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
the
scheme
of
the
act
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
your
honor
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
i
believe
that
the
court
in
south
carolina
v.
katzenbach
and
at
pages
334
and
335
of
383
us
did
pass
on
the
constitutionality
of
the
sus
--
of
the
suspension
of
changes
and
by
the
congress.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well,
i
would
respectfully
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
no,
but,
your
honor,
the
application
of
the
act
follows
after
the
freezing.
in
other
words,
that
application
of
the
act
is
the
procedure
by
which
the
state
may
put
into
effect
the
change.
the
courts
of
the
united
states,
and
i
don't
believe
it
reached
this
court
because
the
voting
rights
act
was
passed
in
the
intervening
time,
but
the
lower
courts
of
the
united
states
in
voting
rights
actions
had
adopted
the
freezing
principle.
they
had
said
that
the
laws
under
which
whites
were
permitted
to
vote
and
negros
were
denied
to
vote,
those
laws
or
those
procedures
would
be
frozen
in
effect
for
a
period
of
time
which
would
allow
the
negros
equal
rights
to
register.
and,
that
was
the
principle
which
congress
embodied
in
section
5.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
i
don't
believe
that
was
the
principle.
the
principle
was
that
congress
said
any
change
shall
be
suspended.
the
present
law
as
of
november
1,
1964
shall
remain
in
effect.
negros
shall
have
five
years.
the
voting
rights
act
is
a
five-year
act.
during
that
five
years,
these
laws
were
to
be
frozen.
the
past
discrimination
was
to
be
cleansed,
and
negros
were
to
be
able
to
vote
and
not,
as
has
occurred
in
this
case,
to
have
to
litigate
the
changes
during
that
brief
five-year
period
while
the
changes
were
in
effect.
the
problem
here
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
i
believe
that
is
what
the
congress
did
and
it
provided
a
speedy
mechanism
to
meet
that
situation
which
your
honor
poses
by
presentation
of
those
laws
to
the
attorney
general
or
the
state,
of
course,
has
the
option
not
to
present
them
to
the
attorney
general
but
to
go
right
to
the
three-judge
court
of
the
district
of
columbia.
in
that
event,
the
suit
would
be
against
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
and
i
would
respond
at
this
point
to
the
fact
that
i
would
not
be
prepared
to
concede,
your
honor,
that
the
suit,
if
lodged
in
the
district
court
for
maine,
would
inappropriate
location.
i
believe
these
decisions
in
the
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
i
believe
that
the
decisions
of
this
court
have
validated
a
suit
in
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia,
and
the
requirement
of
suit
here
where
the
suit
is
brought
against
officials
of
the
united
states
government,
and
this
is
their
domain.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
i
believe
that
the
constitution
requires
that
the
procedure
be
appropriate
to
enforce
the
first
clause
of
the
fifteenth
amendment,
and
i
believe
that
the
appropriateness
here
called
for
speed
and
called
for
the
attorney
general
to
receive
that
action
and
defend
that
action
in
the
district
of
columbia.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
i
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
your
honor
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
i
had
no
such
thought
in
my
mind.
i
would've
--
if
--
i
don't
want
to
be
repetitious,
but
we
do
not
read
the
law
to
lodge
a
power
in
the
attorney
general
which
is
an
absolute
power
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
no,
your
honor.
the
suspension
of
the
law
was
in
the
hands
of
the
congress
of
the
united
states
which
did
do
it
in
section
5.
the
law
was
suspended.
the
change
was
suspended
the
day
the
law
was
passed,
if
there
had
been
changes
since
november
1,
1964.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well,
the
--
your
honor,
that
--
the
chan
--
the
act
was
passed
in,
and
effective,
august
6,
1965
and
the
change
between
november
1,
1964
and
august
6
was
suspended
and
changes
for
the
five
years
after
the
effective
date
were
suspended
until
this
procedure
was
found.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
except
in
so
far
as
those
laws
were
suspended
by
the
voting
rights
act
and
the
tests
and
devices
were
suspended.
the
voucher
requirement,
the
handwriting
requirement,
the
constitutional
interpretation
requirement,
those
were
suspended
by
section
4
of
the
act.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
they
were
open
to
attack
and
the
department
of
justice
was
presently
litigating
them
in
77
voting
rights
cases
in
the
south,
not
all
in
mississippi.
those
cases
were
all
pending
and
this
court
had
before
it,
only
in
earlier
that
year,
in
january
of
1965
the
full
records
of
the
way
tests
and
devices
has
been
used
to
discriminate
the
way.
as
judge
john
brown
of
the
fifth
circuit
said
in
dissent
in
united
states
v.mississippi,
he
said
the
barring
of
one
contrivance
has
too
often
caused
no
change
in
result
only
a
change
in
methods,
and
that
was
judge
brown's
dissent.
this
court
in
the
case
reversed,
in
united
states
v.
mississippi
in
380
us,
just
earlier
in
the
year.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
your
honor,
it
did,
but
the
problem
that
was
presented
to
the
congress
in
passing
a
--
the
five-year
remedial
measure
of
the
voting
rights
act
was
that
the
period
of
time,
as
judge
brown
said
a
change
resulted
then
only
in
the
adoption
of
a
new
contrivance,
that
congress
met
the
situation
whereby
negros
litigated
for
four
to
five
years
sometimes
and
ultimately
prevailed.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
that
is
correct.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
it
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
congress
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
congress
did
not
sanctify
the
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
they
suspended
changes.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
yes,
sir.
we
believe
the
words
the
legislative
history
of
the
initial
interpretation
of
the
statute
by
the
department
of
justice
and
the
interpretations
given
the
statutes
by
the
three
states
who
have
submitted
and,
by
my
review
of
our
files,
endeavored
to
comply
with
section
5,
that
is
south
carolina,
virginia,
and
georgia,
the
interpretation
of
those
states
indicate
that
the
coverage
that
is
contended
for
in
this
--
in
these
three
proceedings
is
the
proper
coverage.
the
opposite
position,
that
is
that
the
statute
reaches
only
the
qualifications
for
registration,
has
little
support,
we
believe.
the
appellees
cite
a
statement
by
assistant
attorney
general
burke
marshall,
for
whose
information
and
knowledge
of
the
statute
i
would
have
very
great
regard.
mr.
marshall
responded
to
a
question
of
congressman
corman
who
asked
him
"mr.
marshall,
has
the
department
of
justice
given
any
consideration
to
the
question
whether
the
statute
should
address
itself
to
the
qualifications
of
candidates
for
office?"
and,
mr.
marshall
responded
"the
main
problem
the
bill
addresses
is
the
qualifications
of
voters."
now,
that,
i
think,
must
be
understood
in
the
context
with
which
mr.
marshall
made
the
statement
and
i
think
it
makes
the
point.
the
bill
addressed
the
problem
that
the
registration
requirements
had
been
implemented
and
used
to
preclude
registration
by
negros.
there
were
few
negros
qualified
to
vote.
in
homes
county,
one
of
the
counties
that
is
involved
in
number
26
here,
one
of
the
school
superintendent
counties,
in
homes,
at
the
time
the
voting
rights
act
was
passed,
there
were
100+%
of
the
whites
registered
and
0.23%
of
the
negros.
i
looked
at
the
figure
for
early
this
year,
1968,
and
in
homes
today
it's
still
100+%
of
the
whites
but
it
is
now
72%
of
the
negros,
and
the
negros
have
a
majority.
in
any
event,
congress
suspending
and
excluding
the
use
of
tests
and
devices
to
discriminate,
but
it
was
also
saying
that
no
changes
in
the
laws
which
would
affect
fifteenth
amendment
rights
would
be
permitted.
and,
that
is
what
it
passed
section
5,
the
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well,
mr.
justice
black,
we
don't
read
that
as
a
delegation.
the
task
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
the
body
that
congress
called
upon
to
make
that
determination
of
whether
the
suspension
should
be
lifted,
and
there's
a
case
of
controversy,
is
the
three-judge
court
for
the
district
of
columbia.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
that's
correct.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
no,
by
reason
of
congress.
that's
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
mr.
justice
harlan,
that
is
what
our
understanding
of
the
law
is,
and
that
is
what
we
read
the
opinion
of
the
chief
justice
to
say
in
the
first
sentence
on
this
subject
in
south
carolina
v.
katzenbach.
the
act
suspends
new
voting
regulations
and
it
--
there
it
is.
the
suspension
--
if
we
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
no.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
the
state
of
mississippi
had
full
360-degree
scope
to
bring
a
lawsuit
in
the
three-judge
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia
on
the
day
it
enacted
these
changes.
the
congress
made
the
judgment,
whether
it
was
wise
or
not
is
not
mine
to
argue
or
review,
and
i
don't
think
is
the
--
relevant
unless
it
were
a
violation
of
the
constitution.
it
made
the
judgment
that
on
the
basis
of
this
ample
record
of
history
of
discrimination,
100
years,
that
the
present
laws
of
these
six
covered
states
and
the
counties
and
three
others
were
to
remain
in
effect
with
the
exception
of
the
suspended
ones,
the
tests
and
devices,
they
were
to
remain
in
effect.
the
congress
said
"we
prefer
those
laws
until
any
changes
are
validated
in
a
lawsuit
in
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia."
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
i
think
it
did
say
it
unconditionally.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
the
attorney
general
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
i
think
that
this
reach
of
the
law
is
broad
because,
as
mr.
katzenbach
in
res
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
that
all
of
those
changes
which
the
state
may
wish
to
make
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
for
five
years,
your
honor,
i
think
that's
what
the
statute
means.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
i
think
the
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
i
do.
i
think
the
attorney
general
has
a
duty,
if
one
is
submitted
to
him,
of
course
the
time
runs
against
the
attorney
general,
60
days.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
that's
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
that
is
my
--
that
is
the
way
i
read
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
i
believe
that
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
yes,
sir.
the
background
of
this
is
indicated
in
the
state
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
yes,
sir,
mr.
justice
fortas.
the
private
right
of
action,
i
believe,
is
indicated
by
the
changes
in
the
wording
of
the
statute
which
were
made
by
the
congress.
as
submitted
by
the
president
and
the
administration,
"the
bill
prohibited
enforcement
of
any,"
and
i
insert
a
word,
"new
law
or
ordinance
imposing
qualifications
or
procedures
for
voting."
it
was
a
prohibition,
in
those
words.
in
made
no
reference
in
section
5
to
persons.
it
prohibited
enforcement
of
a
new
provision.
congress
refrain
section
5
and
broadened
it
and
inserted
the
words
that
until
a
state
complies,
"no
person
shall
be
denied
the
right
to
vote
for
failure
to
comply
with
such
new
qualification."
and,
our
understanding
of
section
5
is
that,
in
adding
the
words
"no
person
shall
be
denied
the
right
to
vote
for
failure
to
comply,"
congress
recognized
and
created
a
right
in
private
persons
to
bring
a
suit
to
enjoin
the
enforcement
of
one
of
the
suspended
statutes.
without
that
provision,
the
private
party
would
have
to
live
under
the
changed
provision
and
would
have
to
travel
the
long
route
of
litigation
in
a
suit
under
28
--
42
usc
1983
in
which
he
would
live
under
the
changed
law
and
litigate
it
while
the
change
was
in
effect.
the
private
right
of
action
permitted
the
plaintiff
to
bring
suit
to
recognize
the
suspension
of
the
statute.
there's
no
problem
about
the
jurisdiction
for
the
private
right
of
action
in
28
united
states
code
1343
section
4
which
authorizes
relief
under
any
act
of
congress
protecting
civil
rights,
including
the
right
to
vote.
we
are
here
contending
that
there's
an
implied
private
right
of
action.this
is
what
the
cong
--
the
court
recognized
last
term
in
jones
v.
mayer
saying
the
fact
that
1982
is
couched
in
declaratory
terms
and
provides
no
explicit
method
of
enforcement,
does
not,
of
course,
prevent
a
federal
court
from
fashioning
an
effective
equitable
remedy.
now,
of
course,
there
are
procedures
in
the
voting
rights
act
that
provide
for
the
enforcement
and
enforcement
procedure
for
section
5.
but,
in
a
number
of
cases,
borak
--
j.i.
case
v.
borak
and
others
under
the
securities
and
exchange
laws,
the
fact
that
one
agency
has
an
enforcement
responsibility
has
not
prevented
the
court
from
recognizing
an
implied
right
of
private
action.
i
would
like
to
take
a
moment
with
respect
to
the
three-judge
court
provision
where,
again,
a
question
of
statutory
interpretation
is
raised.
the
evolution
of
the
words
of
the
statute,
we
believe,
again
shows
that
the
congress
recognized
that
there
would
be
other
actions
besides
the
three-judge
action
in
the
district
of
columbia.
as
the
senate
passed
the
bill,
section
5
referred
to
the
three-judge
--
i'm
sorry,
section
5
referred
to
the
declaratory
judgment
action
required
to
be
brought
in
the
district
of
columbia,
and
then
concluded
in
the
last
sentence
such
an
action
shall
be
before
three
judges.
and,
i
would
read
that
law,
had
it
become
the
law
passed
by
the
congress,
as
limiting
the
requirement
of
three
judges
to
the
district
court.
indeed,
i
might
also
have
read
it
to
limit
or
exclude
any
private
right
of
action.
however,
the
house
did
not
accept
the
senate
version
"such
an
action
shall
be
before
three
judges,"
and
changed
that
language
to
read,
as
it
now
reads
in
the
statute,
"any
action
under
this
section,"
and
my
understanding
of
the
change
in
the
language
is
that
the
congress
recognized
that
there
would
and
could
be
implied
private
actions
and
provided
that
any
im
--
such
private
action
would
be
before
a
three-judge
court.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
that
he
has
to
bring
it
before
a
one-judge
court.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
no,
i
would
believe
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
i
would
believe,
as
mr.
derfner
said,
that
in
the
case
where
he
combines
a
section
5
claim
with
a
claim
of
unconstitutionality
under
the
fifteenth
amendment
that
the
three-judge
court
is
properly
convened.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well,
that's
right.
the
problem
is
not
fully
resolved
in
these
three
cases,
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
because
in
number
25
and
number
26,
the
plaintiffs
dismissed
the
constitutional
claim.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
so,
those
cases
would
not
properly
be
here
if
a
three-judge
court
is
not
required.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
that's
right.
those
two
cases
must
find
it
within
section
5.
we
don't
rely
on
contentions
as
an
amicus
that
the
general
doctrines
of
this
court
annunciated
in
swift
v.
wickham
or
other
cases
would
validate
a
three-judge
court
here
if
it
can't
be
found.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
that
is
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
before
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
yes,
sir?
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
we
would
say
the
state
is
correct.
we
knew
of
these
changes
at
that
date,
bug
we
would
say
that
the
attorney
general
must
rely
upon
formal
procedures
that
the
submission
of
the
changes
is
submitted
by
the
chief
legal
officer
of
the
state
or
the
county
and
that
we
have
followed
those
formal
procedures.
in
the
argument
on
south
carolina
v.
katzenbach,
the
question
of
the
6:00-7:00
change
by
south
carolina
was
raised
in
argument,
and
mr.
katzenbach
said
the
united
states
has
no
objection
to
that
change.
it's
argued
by
appellees
that
that
exchange
with
this
court
was
an
approval
by
the
attorney
general
of
that
change
in
--
under
the
terms
of
section
5.
in
fact,
i've
reviewed
the
files
of
the
department.
south
carolina,
15
days
after
the
argument,
submitted
that
change
in
writing
to
the
attorney
general
and
the
attorney
general
responded
in
writing
on
april
1,
1966
saying
that
he
had
no
objection
to
that
change.
we
must
rely
on
the
procedures
that
are
established
by
section
5.
we
do
not
feel
called
upon
and,
indeed,
would've
considered
it
out
of
order
to
have
expressed
an
objection
in
a
response
to
the
clerk's
request
for
our
view
because
that
is
not
the
issue
here,
as
has
come
out
in
the
argument.
the
merits
of
these
changes
are
not
at
issue.
we
have
said
in
our
brief
and
i
would
say,
in
oral
argument,
that
we
think
each
of
these
three
changes
poses
a
serious
question
of
fifteenth
amendment
violation.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
rather
than
the
fifteenth
amendment?
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
yes,
i
believe
that
the
posing
of
the
validity
of
the
statute
is
envisioned
by
section
14
of
the
law
to
be
determined
in
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
i
do.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
the
statute?
i
thought
you
meant
section
5.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
we
had
that
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
yes,
the
state
statute.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
under
--
i
don't
think
the
statute
withdraws
power.
i
change
my
answer
upon
better
understanding.
the
statute
does
not
mean
to
remove
the
power
or
the
right
of
a
private
citizen
to
sue
under
1983
where
his
rights
are
deprived
by
an
unconstitutional
statute.
he
can
still
go
into
the
--
it
would
really
be
a
three-judge
court,
but
he
can
go
in
to
litigate
the
constitutionality
of
the
new
law.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
i
would
agree
with
that,
it's
not.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
it's
not
an
effective
statute
and
the
court
should
under
--
the
court
should
understand
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
it
should
dismiss
it.
you're
correct.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
so,
the
jurisdiction
would
only
--
i
suppose
logic
would
say
that
there's
jurisdiction.
there's
no
case
or
controversy
until
the
60
days
have
passed
because
there's
no
law.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
yes,
not
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well,
mr.
justice
white
has
analyzed
that
to,
correctly
i
believe
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
that's
right.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
on
that
analysis,
you
wouldn't.
that
analysis
strikes
me
as
correct.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
that
is
the
way
we
would
read
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
yes,
sir.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
the
department
of
justice
has,
in
prior
cases,
sought
not
to
upset
elections
that
have
previously
been
held
and,
therefore,
we
would
be
loathed
to
urge
this
court
to
order
the
school
superintendents
who
were
appointed
or
the
county
supervisors
who
were
elected
at
large
in
adams
and
forrest
counties
to
be
--
their
elections
be
upset.
we
would
ask
this
court
to
declare
the
changed
laws,
in
effect,
perspectively
and
to
remand
to
the
district
court
for
requirement
of
new
elections.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
no,
i
believe
that
the
issue
--
if
i
understand
your
honor,
i
believe
the
issue
in
the
three-judge
court
for
the
district
of
columbia
is
the
constitutionality
under
the
fifteenth
amendment.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
i
do.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
that's
right,
and
the
attorney
general
should
apply
a
fifteenth
amendment
standard
in
offering
that
avenue.
there's
one
statement
by
mr.
katzenbach
in
the
hearings
in
response
to
a
question
posed
by
senator
irving.
he
said
"but
the
f"
--
this
is
at
page
237
of
the
senate
hearings,
but
the
effort
here
was
to
get
at
things
that
were
not
included
within
the
words
"tests
and
devices"
and
the
thought
that
other
things
that
violated
the
fifteenth
amendment
by
a
state
should
also
be
subjected
to
judicial
review.
i
--
it
might
help
the
court
if
i
just
related
a
statistic
which
i
assembled
before
i
came.
it
came
up
and
argument
was
alluded
to
by
other
counsel.
the
department
has
received
251
submissions
under
section
5.
it
has
received
one
submission
in
november
of
1965
from
alabama,
a
submission
from
a
county
in
mississippi
in
1966,
one,
and
no
submissions
from
the
state
of
louisiana.
we
have
received
a
number
of
submissions
from
the
state
of
georgia
a
number
or
a
few
submissions
from
the
state
of
virginia
and
a
rather
large
number
of
submissions
from
the
state
of
south
carolina.
the
only
occasions
that
the
department
has
had
to
state
that
it
could
not
consent
were
one
case
from
the
state
of
georgia
where
the
change
was
contrary
in
our
judgment
to
a
prior
court
decision
on
the
same
issue,
the
court
decision
having
been
made
after
the
voting
rights
act.
and,
two
other
cases
from
the
state
of
georgia
where,
inadvertently,
the
changed
statute
incorporated
another
section
of
the
georgia
law
by
reference
and
that
other
section
provided
for
a
test
or
device.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well,
we
have
in
no
case
--
we
must
act
within
60
days
and
in
no
case
on
the
first
submissions
have
we
ever
received
any
request
to
speed
up
our
reaction.
i
believe
we
could
do
that
and,
generally,
matters
being
what
they
are,
we
take
most
of
the
60
days
but
that
--
there's
no
necessary
requirement
that
we
do
so,
and
the
question
was
raised
in
the
argument
on
the
section
5
aspect
of
the
allen
case
which
your
honors
heard
yesterday
as
to
the
speed
with
which
it
could
be
done.
it
seems
to
me
they're
--
the
department
of
justice
ought
to
be
capable
of
dealing
with
these
things
promptly.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
i
do
think
the
remand
order
of
this
court
could
incorporate
that
provision
that
if
the
state
wishes
to
submit
the
provision
promptly
to
the
attorney
general
and
if
the
attorney
general
states
no
objection,
then
the
provision
would
have
been
effective
and,
indeed,
is
effective
and
new
elections
are
not
required.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
that's
right.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
i
believe
that
the
proper
procedures
would
be
for
the
state
to
have
available
to
it
all
of
the
powers
of
stay
authority
and
injunctive
authority
pending
a
hearing
on
the
merits
in
the
three-judge
court
in
the
district
of
columbia.
if
my
prior
statements
would
indicate
that
the
remand
of
this
court
ought
to
preclude
the
state
from
that,
i
suppose
i
want
to
amend
them,
but
i
don't
think
that
i
can
stray
from
the
fact
that
the
state
of
matters
here
was
entered
into
by
the
state
of
mississippi
with
knowledge
of
the
court's
decision
in
south
carolina,
with
knowledge
that
the
court
had
ruled
that
the
law
was
suspended
and,
therefore,
the
court
really
faces
the
situation
that
your
honors
already
mentioned
that
these
laws
had
not
been
in
effect
down
to
the
day.
they're
not
in
effect
now
under
our
reading
of
the
statute.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well,
i
stated
that
it
should
remand
the
case.
i
would
respectfully
suggest
that
it
remands
the
case
to
the
district
court
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
with
directions
that
the
district
court
declare
the
laws
not
in
effect
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
so
procedures
of
section
5
are
followed.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
that's
right,
and
i
--
well,
perhaps
--
i
will
answer
your
question,
but
perhaps
i
should
also
ask
the
leave
of
the
court
to
frame
paper
and
submit
it
to
the
court
with
a
careful
statement
of
what
the
relief
should
be,
not
being
the
plaintiff
parties
in
the
case
the
government
has
not
spelled
out
in
its
preparation
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
we'll
do
that.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
oh
yes,
sir.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
this
morning
is
a
statutory
interpretation
one.
it
involves
the
responsibilities
of
the
states
and
the
rights
of
citizens
under
section
5
of
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965.
as
has
already
been
presented
before
the
court,
the
major
and
overwriting
issue
is
whether
failure
to
comply
with
the
procedures
of
section
5
precluded
enforcement
of
the
changed
laws
concerning
the
election
of
county
supervisors,
the
appointment
of
county
civil
school
superintendents,
and
the
requirements
for
qualification
of
independent
candidates.
the
argument
thus
far
has
focused
on
one
of
four
issues,
which
the
appellees
have
projected
in
the
case
in
which
we
believe
are
in
the
case.
i'd
like
to
state
them
and
i'm
prepared
to
present
argument
on
each
of
them.
the
first
is
whether
section
5
is
limited
to
the
qualifications
for
registration
to
vote
or
whether
it
reaches
beyond
that
scope
to
cover
changes
which
affect
voting
and
may
violate
the
fifteenth
amendment.
the
second
issue,
not
yet
discussed,
is
whether,
where
a
state
fails
to
comply
with
the
procedures
of
section
5,
a
person
whose
vote
is
affected
has
a
private
right
of
action
to
seek
to
enjoin
the
enforcement
of
that
changed
law.
the
third
issue
is
whether,
if
such
a
private
right
of
action
is
authorized
by
section
5,
it
must
be
bought
--
brought
as
the
suits
here
were
brought
before
three-judge
courts.
and,
the
last
issue
is
whether
these
appeals
are
mooted
because
when
the
clerk
of
this
court
requested
the
attorney
general
for
his
views
on
march
11
of
this
year.
he
gave
the
attorney
general
notice
of
the
changes
and
the
attorney
general
has
not
made
formal
objection,
or
at
least
that
is
how
the
issue
is
stated
in
the
appellees'
briefs.
i
believe
the
facts
of
these
cases
bear
witness
to
the
prophetic
vision
of
the
congress
in
enacting
the
voting
rights
act.
it
was
concerned,
as
the
reports
of
the
committees
and
the
debates
indicate,
that
once
the
barriers
to
registration
were
down,
the
states
covered
by
the
voting
rights
act
might
resort,
as
they
had
resorted
through
previous
100
years
to
other
statutes
to
preclude
effective
votes
by
negros.
the
voting
rights
act
was
essentially
a
statute
which,
one,
suspended
literacy
tests
and
devices
which
had
been
used
to
discriminate
and,
two,
has
had
the
courts
in
the
previous
few
years
sought
to
freeze
the
presently
existing
statutes
so
that
when
the
literacy
tests
were
out
of
the
way
and
negros
were
able
to
register,
those
then
existing
statutes
would
remain
in
effect
until
the
attorney
general
or
a
court
of
three
judges
and,
in
turn,
this
court
had
reviewed
the
change
to
determine
that
the
change
was
not
a
violation
of
the
fifteenth
amendment.
it
did
not
put
any
final
powers
in
the
attorney
general,
as
we
read
it.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
i
didn't
hear
the
first
words
of
your
question,
sir.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
the
court
of
three
judges
of
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia.
it
was
logged
in
a
court
and
the
only
role
of
the
attorney
general,
there
is
no
requirement
as
we
read
the
--
section
5,
that
the
state
must
make
a
submission
to
the
attorney
general.
it
may
move
to
the
three-judge
court
immediately
after
--
when
it
wishes
to
enact
or
enforce
a
changed
law.
the
only
provision
for
the
attorney
general
is
that
if
the
state
believes
that
it
has
a
change
which
is
not
violative
of
the
fifteenth
amendment
and
wishes
to
move
through
this
procedure
established
by
section
5
faster
than
it
believes
it
can
move
to
the
district
court,
it
may
submit
it
to
the
attorney
general.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
it
--
we
read
it
to
require
a
three-judge
court,
and
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
in
either
case.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
it
would
be,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
no,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
i
believe
that
the
decision
of
this
court
in
south
carolina
validated
the
constitutionality
of
section
5.
i
believe
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
i
believe
the
first
issue
that
is
--
we've
--
i
articulated
this
morning,
the
scope
of
section
5,
is
still
open
for
this
court
to
rule
in
this
case.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
your
honor,
the
court
had
section
5
before
it,
in
that,
a
south
carolina
statute
changing
the
hours
of
voting
from
6:00
in
the
evening
to
7:00
in
the
evening
was
presented
and
the
attorney
general
adverted
to
it
in
the
course
of
the
argument.
the
court
makes
reference
to
that
change
in
its
opinion
in
a
foot
--
in
the
text
and
also
in
a
footnote
on
page
320.
it
also
makes
the
statement
there
are
indication
in
the
record
that
other
sections
the
country
listed
above
have
also
altered
their
voting
laws
since
november
1,
1964,
but
the
court
did
not
have
before
it
the
procedures
which
would
be
followed
by
the
attorney
general
or
beyond
that
by
the
court
if
there
were
any
unusual
procedures.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
your
honor,
i
believe
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
i
believe
the
court
did
make
this
holding,
not
that
--
i
want
to
say
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
i
want
to
stay
away
from
a
statement
or
an
argument
that
the
court
held
that
if
the
attorney
general
said
it
was
bad,
i
believe
those
were
your
honor's
words
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
the
point
that
the
court
ruled
upon
was
this,
and
i
believe
it
did
hold
this.
the
act
suspends
new
voting
regulations,
pending
scrutiny
by
federal
authorities
to
depend
to
determine
whether
their
use
would
violate
the
fifteenth
amendment.
i
believe
that
the
voting
rights
act,
as
i've
used
the
word
before,
froze
the
laws
at
the
time
it
was
passed
or
as
of
november
1,
1964.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
it
froze
those
laws
and
said
if
the
state
wished
to
change
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
no,
the
act.
congress
of
the
united
states
froze
it.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
no,
i
don't
believe
--
i
believe
what
the
scheme
of
the
act,
and
i'm
prepared
to
advert
to
the
legislative
history
which
i
think
is
relevant,
but
the
scheme
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
the
scheme
of
the
act
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
your
honor
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
i
believe
that
the
court
in
south
carolina
v.
katzenbach
and
at
pages
334
and
335
of
383
us
did
pass
on
the
constitutionality
of
the
sus
--
of
the
suspension
of
changes
and
by
the
congress.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well,
i
would
respectfully
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
no,
but,
your
honor,
the
application
of
the
act
follows
after
the
freezing.
in
other
words,
that
application
of
the
act
is
the
procedure
by
which
the
state
may
put
into
effect
the
change.
the
courts
of
the
united
states,
and
i
don't
believe
it
reached
this
court
because
the
voting
rights
act
was
passed
in
the
intervening
time,
but
the
lower
courts
of
the
united
states
in
voting
rights
actions
had
adopted
the
freezing
principle.
they
had
said
that
the
laws
under
which
whites
were
permitted
to
vote
and
negros
were
denied
to
vote,
those
laws
or
those
procedures
would
be
frozen
in
effect
for
a
period
of
time
which
would
allow
the
negros
equal
rights
to
register.
and,
that
was
the
principle
which
congress
embodied
in
section
5.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
i
don't
believe
that
was
the
principle.
the
principle
was
that
congress
said
any
change
shall
be
suspended.
the
present
law
as
of
november
1,
1964
shall
remain
in
effect.
negros
shall
have
five
years.
the
voting
rights
act
is
a
five-year
act.
during
that
five
years,
these
laws
were
to
be
frozen.
the
past
discrimination
was
to
be
cleansed,
and
negros
were
to
be
able
to
vote
and
not,
as
has
occurred
in
this
case,
to
have
to
litigate
the
changes
during
that
brief
five-year
period
while
the
changes
were
in
effect.
the
problem
here
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
i
believe
that
is
what
the
congress
did
and
it
provided
a
speedy
mechanism
to
meet
that
situation
which
your
honor
poses
by
presentation
of
those
laws
to
the
attorney
general
or
the
state,
of
course,
has
the
option
not
to
present
them
to
the
attorney
general
but
to
go
right
to
the
three-judge
court
of
the
district
of
columbia.
in
that
event,
the
suit
would
be
against
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
and
i
would
respond
at
this
point
to
the
fact
that
i
would
not
be
prepared
to
concede,
your
honor,
that
the
suit,
if
lodged
in
the
district
court
for
maine,
would
inappropriate
location.
i
believe
these
decisions
in
the
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
i
believe
that
the
decisions
of
this
court
have
validated
a
suit
in
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia,
and
the
requirement
of
suit
here
where
the
suit
is
brought
against
officials
of
the
united
states
government,
and
this
is
their
domain.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
i
believe
that
the
constitution
requires
that
the
procedure
be
appropriate
to
enforce
the
first
clause
of
the
fifteenth
amendment,
and
i
believe
that
the
appropriateness
here
called
for
speed
and
called
for
the
attorney
general
to
receive
that
action
and
defend
that
action
in
the
district
of
columbia.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
i
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
your
honor
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
i
had
no
such
thought
in
my
mind.
i
would've
--
if
--
i
don't
want
to
be
repetitious,
but
we
do
not
read
the
law
to
lodge
a
power
in
the
attorney
general
which
is
an
absolute
power
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
no,
your
honor.
the
suspension
of
the
law
was
in
the
hands
of
the
congress
of
the
united
states
which
did
do
it
in
section
5.
the
law
was
suspended.
the
change
was
suspended
the
day
the
law
was
passed,
if
there
had
been
changes
since
november
1,
1964.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well,
the
--
your
honor,
that
--
the
chan
--
the
act
was
passed
in,
and
effective,
august
6,
1965
and
the
change
between
november
1,
1964
and
august
6
was
suspended
and
changes
for
the
five
years
after
the
effective
date
were
suspended
until
this
procedure
was
found.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
except
in
so
far
as
those
laws
were
suspended
by
the
voting
rights
act
and
the
tests
and
devices
were
suspended.
the
voucher
requirement,
the
handwriting
requirement,
the
constitutional
interpretation
requirement,
those
were
suspended
by
section
4
of
the
act.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
they
were
open
to
attack
and
the
department
of
justice
was
presently
litigating
them
in
77
voting
rights
cases
in
the
south,
not
all
in
mississippi.
those
cases
were
all
pending
and
this
court
had
before
it,
only
in
earlier
that
year,
in
january
of
1965
the
full
records
of
the
way
tests
and
devices
has
been
used
to
discriminate
the
way.
as
judge
john
brown
of
the
fifth
circuit
said
in
dissent
in
united
states
v.mississippi,
he
said
the
barring
of
one
contrivance
has
too
often
caused
no
change
in
result
only
a
change
in
methods,
and
that
was
judge
brown's
dissent.
this
court
in
the
case
reversed,
in
united
states
v.
mississippi
in
380
us,
just
earlier
in
the
year.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
your
honor,
it
did,
but
the
problem
that
was
presented
to
the
congress
in
passing
a
--
the
five-year
remedial
measure
of
the
voting
rights
act
was
that
the
period
of
time,
as
judge
brown
said
a
change
resulted
then
only
in
the
adoption
of
a
new
contrivance,
that
congress
met
the
situation
whereby
negros
litigated
for
four
to
five
years
sometimes
and
ultimately
prevailed.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
that
is
correct.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
it
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
congress
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
congress
did
not
sanctify
the
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
they
suspended
changes.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
yes,
sir.
we
believe
the
words
the
legislative
history
of
the
initial
interpretation
of
the
statute
by
the
department
of
justice
and
the
interpretations
given
the
statutes
by
the
three
states
who
have
submitted
and,
by
my
review
of
our
files,
endeavored
to
comply
with
section
5,
that
is
south
carolina,
virginia,
and
georgia,
the
interpretation
of
those
states
indicate
that
the
coverage
that
is
contended
for
in
this
--
in
these
three
proceedings
is
the
proper
coverage.
the
opposite
position,
that
is
that
the
statute
reaches
only
the
qualifications
for
registration,
has
little
support,
we
believe.
the
appellees
cite
a
statement
by
assistant
attorney
general
burke
marshall,
for
whose
information
and
knowledge
of
the
statute
i
would
have
very
great
regard.
mr.
marshall
responded
to
a
question
of
congressman
corman
who
asked
him
"mr.
marshall,
has
the
department
of
justice
given
any
consideration
to
the
question
whether
the
statute
should
address
itself
to
the
qualifications
of
candidates
for
office?"
and,
mr.
marshall
responded
"the
main
problem
the
bill
addresses
is
the
qualifications
of
voters."
now,
that,
i
think,
must
be
understood
in
the
context
with
which
mr.
marshall
made
the
statement
and
i
think
it
makes
the
point.
the
bill
addressed
the
problem
that
the
registration
requirements
had
been
implemented
and
used
to
preclude
registration
by
negros.
there
were
few
negros
qualified
to
vote.
in
homes
county,
one
of
the
counties
that
is
involved
in
number
26
here,
one
of
the
school
superintendent
counties,
in
homes,
at
the
time
the
voting
rights
act
was
passed,
there
were
100+%
of
the
whites
registered
and
0.23%
of
the
negros.
i
looked
at
the
figure
for
early
this
year,
1968,
and
in
homes
today
it's
still
100+%
of
the
whites
but
it
is
now
72%
of
the
negros,
and
the
negros
have
a
majority.
in
any
event,
congress
suspending
and
excluding
the
use
of
tests
and
devices
to
discriminate,
but
it
was
also
saying
that
no
changes
in
the
laws
which
would
affect
fifteenth
amendment
rights
would
be
permitted.
and,
that
is
what
it
passed
section
5,
the
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well,
mr.
justice
black,
we
don't
read
that
as
a
delegation.
the
task
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
the
body
that
congress
called
upon
to
make
that
determination
of
whether
the
suspension
should
be
lifted,
and
there's
a
case
of
controversy,
is
the
three-judge
court
for
the
district
of
columbia.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
that's
correct.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
no,
by
reason
of
congress.
that's
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
mr.
justice
harlan,
that
is
what
our
understanding
of
the
law
is,
and
that
is
what
we
read
the
opinion
of
the
chief
justice
to
say
in
the
first
sentence
on
this
subject
in
south
carolina
v.
katzenbach.
the
act
suspends
new
voting
regulations
and
it
--
there
it
is.
the
suspension
--
if
we
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
no.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
the
state
of
mississippi
had
full
360-degree
scope
to
bring
a
lawsuit
in
the
three-judge
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia
on
the
day
it
enacted
these
changes.
the
congress
made
the
judgment,
whether
it
was
wise
or
not
is
not
mine
to
argue
or
review,
and
i
don't
think
is
the
--
relevant
unless
it
were
a
violation
of
the
constitution.
it
made
the
judgment
that
on
the
basis
of
this
ample
record
of
history
of
discrimination,
100
years,
that
the
present
laws
of
these
six
covered
states
and
the
counties
and
three
others
were
to
remain
in
effect
with
the
exception
of
the
suspended
ones,
the
tests
and
devices,
they
were
to
remain
in
effect.
the
congress
said
"we
prefer
those
laws
until
any
changes
are
validated
in
a
lawsuit
in
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia."
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
i
think
it
did
say
it
unconditionally.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
the
attorney
general
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
i
think
that
this
reach
of
the
law
is
broad
because,
as
mr.
katzenbach
in
res
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
that
all
of
those
changes
which
the
state
may
wish
to
make
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
for
five
years,
your
honor,
i
think
that's
what
the
statute
means.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
i
think
the
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
i
do.
i
think
the
attorney
general
has
a
duty,
if
one
is
submitted
to
him,
of
course
the
time
runs
against
the
attorney
general,
60
days.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
that's
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
that
is
my
--
that
is
the
way
i
read
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
i
believe
that
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
yes,
sir.
the
background
of
this
is
indicated
in
the
state
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
yes,
sir,
mr.
justice
fortas.
the
private
right
of
action,
i
believe,
is
indicated
by
the
changes
in
the
wording
of
the
statute
which
were
made
by
the
congress.
as
submitted
by
the
president
and
the
administration,
"the
bill
prohibited
enforcement
of
any,"
and
i
insert
a
word,
"new
law
or
ordinance
imposing
qualifications
or
procedures
for
voting."
it
was
a
prohibition,
in
those
words.
in
made
no
reference
in
section
5
to
persons.
it
prohibited
enforcement
of
a
new
provision.
congress
refrain
section
5
and
broadened
it
and
inserted
the
words
that
until
a
state
complies,
"no
person
shall
be
denied
the
right
to
vote
for
failure
to
comply
with
such
new
qualification."
and,
our
understanding
of
section
5
is
that,
in
adding
the
words
"no
person
shall
be
denied
the
right
to
vote
for
failure
to
comply,"
congress
recognized
and
created
a
right
in
private
persons
to
bring
a
suit
to
enjoin
the
enforcement
of
one
of
the
suspended
statutes.
without
that
provision,
the
private
party
would
have
to
live
under
the
changed
provision
and
would
have
to
travel
the
long
route
of
litigation
in
a
suit
under
28
--
42
usc
1983
in
which
he
would
live
under
the
changed
law
and
litigate
it
while
the
change
was
in
effect.
the
private
right
of
action
permitted
the
plaintiff
to
bring
suit
to
recognize
the
suspension
of
the
statute.
there's
no
problem
about
the
jurisdiction
for
the
private
right
of
action
in
28
united
states
code
1343
section
4
which
authorizes
relief
under
any
act
of
congress
protecting
civil
rights,
including
the
right
to
vote.
we
are
here
contending
that
there's
an
implied
private
right
of
action.this
is
what
the
cong
--
the
court
recognized
last
term
in
jones
v.
mayer
saying
the
fact
that
1982
is
couched
in
declaratory
terms
and
provides
no
explicit
method
of
enforcement,
does
not,
of
course,
prevent
a
federal
court
from
fashioning
an
effective
equitable
remedy.
now,
of
course,
there
are
procedures
in
the
voting
rights
act
that
provide
for
the
enforcement
and
enforcement
procedure
for
section
5.
but,
in
a
number
of
cases,
borak
--
j.i.
case
v.
borak
and
others
under
the
securities
and
exchange
laws,
the
fact
that
one
agency
has
an
enforcement
responsibility
has
not
prevented
the
court
from
recognizing
an
implied
right
of
private
action.
i
would
like
to
take
a
moment
with
respect
to
the
three-judge
court
provision
where,
again,
a
question
of
statutory
interpretation
is
raised.
the
evolution
of
the
words
of
the
statute,
we
believe,
again
shows
that
the
congress
recognized
that
there
would
be
other
actions
besides
the
three-judge
action
in
the
district
of
columbia.
as
the
senate
passed
the
bill,
section
5
referred
to
the
three-judge
--
i'm
sorry,
section
5
referred
to
the
declaratory
judgment
action
required
to
be
brought
in
the
district
of
columbia,
and
then
concluded
in
the
last
sentence
such
an
action
shall
be
before
three
judges.
and,
i
would
read
that
law,
had
it
become
the
law
passed
by
the
congress,
as
limiting
the
requirement
of
three
judges
to
the
district
court.
indeed,
i
might
also
have
read
it
to
limit
or
exclude
any
private
right
of
action.
however,
the
house
did
not
accept
the
senate
version
"such
an
action
shall
be
before
three
judges,"
and
changed
that
language
to
read,
as
it
now
reads
in
the
statute,
"any
action
under
this
section,"
and
my
understanding
of
the
change
in
the
language
is
that
the
congress
recognized
that
there
would
and
could
be
implied
private
actions
and
provided
that
any
im
--
such
private
action
would
be
before
a
three-judge
court.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
that
he
has
to
bring
it
before
a
one-judge
court.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
no,
i
would
believe
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
i
would
believe,
as
mr.
derfner
said,
that
in
the
case
where
he
combines
a
section
5
claim
with
a
claim
of
unconstitutionality
under
the
fifteenth
amendment
that
the
three-judge
court
is
properly
convened.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well,
that's
right.
the
problem
is
not
fully
resolved
in
these
three
cases,
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
because
in
number
25
and
number
26,
the
plaintiffs
dismissed
the
constitutional
claim.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
so,
those
cases
would
not
properly
be
here
if
a
three-judge
court
is
not
required.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
that's
right.
those
two
cases
must
find
it
within
section
5.
we
don't
rely
on
contentions
as
an
amicus
that
the
general
doctrines
of
this
court
annunciated
in
swift
v.
wickham
or
other
cases
would
validate
a
three-judge
court
here
if
it
can't
be
found.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
that
is
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
before
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
yes,
sir?
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
we
would
say
the
state
is
correct.
we
knew
of
these
changes
at
that
date,
bug
we
would
say
that
the
attorney
general
must
rely
upon
formal
procedures
that
the
submission
of
the
changes
is
submitted
by
the
chief
legal
officer
of
the
state
or
the
county
and
that
we
have
followed
those
formal
procedures.
in
the
argument
on
south
carolina
v.
katzenbach,
the
question
of
the
6:00-7:00
change
by
south
carolina
was
raised
in
argument,
and
mr.
katzenbach
said
the
united
states
has
no
objection
to
that
change.
it's
argued
by
appellees
that
that
exchange
with
this
court
was
an
approval
by
the
attorney
general
of
that
change
in
--
under
the
terms
of
section
5.
in
fact,
i've
reviewed
the
files
of
the
department.
south
carolina,
15
days
after
the
argument,
submitted
that
change
in
writing
to
the
attorney
general
and
the
attorney
general
responded
in
writing
on
april
1,
1966
saying
that
he
had
no
objection
to
that
change.
we
must
rely
on
the
procedures
that
are
established
by
section
5.
we
do
not
feel
called
upon
and,
indeed,
would've
considered
it
out
of
order
to
have
expressed
an
objection
in
a
response
to
the
clerk's
request
for
our
view
because
that
is
not
the
issue
here,
as
has
come
out
in
the
argument.
the
merits
of
these
changes
are
not
at
issue.
we
have
said
in
our
brief
and
i
would
say,
in
oral
argument,
that
we
think
each
of
these
three
changes
poses
a
serious
question
of
fifteenth
amendment
violation.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
rather
than
the
fifteenth
amendment?
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
yes,
i
believe
that
the
posing
of
the
validity
of
the
statute
is
envisioned
by
section
14
of
the
law
to
be
determined
in
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
i
do.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
the
statute?
i
thought
you
meant
section
5.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
we
had
that
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
yes,
the
state
statute.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
under
--
i
don't
think
the
statute
withdraws
power.
i
change
my
answer
upon
better
understanding.
the
statute
does
not
mean
to
remove
the
power
or
the
right
of
a
private
citizen
to
sue
under
1983
where
his
rights
are
deprived
by
an
unconstitutional
statute.
he
can
still
go
into
the
--
it
would
really
be
a
three-judge
court,
but
he
can
go
in
to
litigate
the
constitutionality
of
the
new
law.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
i
would
agree
with
that,
it's
not.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
it's
not
an
effective
statute
and
the
court
should
under
--
the
court
should
understand
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
it
should
dismiss
it.
you're
correct.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
so,
the
jurisdiction
would
only
--
i
suppose
logic
would
say
that
there's
jurisdiction.
there's
no
case
or
controversy
until
the
60
days
have
passed
because
there's
no
law.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
yes,
not
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well,
mr.
justice
white
has
analyzed
that
to,
correctly
i
believe
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
that's
right.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
on
that
analysis,
you
wouldn't.
that
analysis
strikes
me
as
correct.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
that
is
the
way
we
would
read
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
yes,
sir.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
the
department
of
justice
has,
in
prior
cases,
sought
not
to
upset
elections
that
have
previously
been
held
and,
therefore,
we
would
be
loathed
to
urge
this
court
to
order
the
school
superintendents
who
were
appointed
or
the
county
supervisors
who
were
elected
at
large
in
adams
and
forrest
counties
to
be
--
their
elections
be
upset.
we
would
ask
this
court
to
declare
the
changed
laws,
in
effect,
perspectively
and
to
remand
to
the
district
court
for
requirement
of
new
elections.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
no,
i
believe
that
the
issue
--
if
i
understand
your
honor,
i
believe
the
issue
in
the
three-judge
court
for
the
district
of
columbia
is
the
constitutionality
under
the
fifteenth
amendment.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
i
do.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
that's
right,
and
the
attorney
general
should
apply
a
fifteenth
amendment
standard
in
offering
that
avenue.
there's
one
statement
by
mr.
katzenbach
in
the
hearings
in
response
to
a
question
posed
by
senator
irving.
he
said
"but
the
f"
--
this
is
at
page
237
of
the
senate
hearings,
but
the
effort
here
was
to
get
at
things
that
were
not
included
within
the
words
"tests
and
devices"
and
the
thought
that
other
things
that
violated
the
fifteenth
amendment
by
a
state
should
also
be
subjected
to
judicial
review.
i
--
it
might
help
the
court
if
i
just
related
a
statistic
which
i
assembled
before
i
came.
it
came
up
and
argument
was
alluded
to
by
other
counsel.
the
department
has
received
251
submissions
under
section
5.
it
has
received
one
submission
in
november
of
1965
from
alabama,
a
submission
from
a
county
in
mississippi
in
1966,
one,
and
no
submissions
from
the
state
of
louisiana.
we
have
received
a
number
of
submissions
from
the
state
of
georgia
a
number
or
a
few
submissions
from
the
state
of
virginia
and
a
rather
large
number
of
submissions
from
the
state
of
south
carolina.
the
only
occasions
that
the
department
has
had
to
state
that
it
could
not
consent
were
one
case
from
the
state
of
georgia
where
the
change
was
contrary
in
our
judgment
to
a
prior
court
decision
on
the
same
issue,
the
court
decision
having
been
made
after
the
voting
rights
act.
and,
two
other
cases
from
the
state
of
georgia
where,
inadvertently,
the
changed
statute
incorporated
another
section
of
the
georgia
law
by
reference
and
that
other
section
provided
for
a
test
or
device.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well,
we
have
in
no
case
--
we
must
act
within
60
days
and
in
no
case
on
the
first
submissions
have
we
ever
received
any
request
to
speed
up
our
reaction.
i
believe
we
could
do
that
and,
generally,
matters
being
what
they
are,
we
take
most
of
the
60
days
but
that
--
there's
no
necessary
requirement
that
we
do
so,
and
the
question
was
raised
in
the
argument
on
the
section
5
aspect
of
the
allen
case
which
your
honors
heard
yesterday
as
to
the
speed
with
which
it
could
be
done.
it
seems
to
me
they're
--
the
department
of
justice
ought
to
be
capable
of
dealing
with
these
things
promptly.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
i
do
think
the
remand
order
of
this
court
could
incorporate
that
provision
that
if
the
state
wishes
to
submit
the
provision
promptly
to
the
attorney
general
and
if
the
attorney
general
states
no
objection,
then
the
provision
would
have
been
effective
and,
indeed,
is
effective
and
new
elections
are
not
required.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
that's
right.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
i
believe
that
the
proper
procedures
would
be
for
the
state
to
have
available
to
it
all
of
the
powers
of
stay
authority
and
injunctive
authority
pending
a
hearing
on
the
merits
in
the
three-judge
court
in
the
district
of
columbia.
if
my
prior
statements
would
indicate
that
the
remand
of
this
court
ought
to
preclude
the
state
from
that,
i
suppose
i
want
to
amend
them,
but
i
don't
think
that
i
can
stray
from
the
fact
that
the
state
of
matters
here
was
entered
into
by
the
state
of
mississippi
with
knowledge
of
the
court's
decision
in
south
carolina,
with
knowledge
that
the
court
had
ruled
that
the
law
was
suspended
and,
therefore,
the
court
really
faces
the
situation
that
your
honors
already
mentioned
that
these
laws
had
not
been
in
effect
down
to
the
day.
they're
not
in
effect
now
under
our
reading
of
the
statute.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well,
i
stated
that
it
should
remand
the
case.
i
would
respectfully
suggest
that
it
remands
the
case
to
the
district
court
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
with
directions
that
the
district
court
declare
the
laws
not
in
effect
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
so
procedures
of
section
5
are
followed.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
that's
right,
and
i
--
well,
perhaps
--
i
will
answer
your
question,
but
perhaps
i
should
also
ask
the
leave
of
the
court
to
frame
paper
and
submit
