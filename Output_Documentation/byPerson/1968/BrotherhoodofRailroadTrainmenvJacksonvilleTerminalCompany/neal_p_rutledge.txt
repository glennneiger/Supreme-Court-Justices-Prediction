mr.
neal
p.
rutledge
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
another
of
a
long
series
of
cases
that
have
come
before
this
court
with
increasing
frequency
in
this
century
which
poses
the
familiar
problem
of
state's
rights
on
the
one
hand
versus
federal
control
or
preemption
of
economic
relations
affecting
interstate
commerce.
this
is
the
second
appearance
before
this
court
of
this
case
in
the
sense
of
the
conduct
that
is
involved.
the
prior
case
came
up
through
the
federal
court
system.
it
arises
and
i
will
just
sketch
briefly
the
factual
situation.
it
arises
out
of
a
long
standing
strike
against
the
florida
east
coast
railroad
which
runs
in
florida
roughly
from
jacksonville
down
to
miami.
the
florida
east
coast
railroad
is
a
class
1
railroad
covered
by
the
interstate
commerce
act
and
the
railway
labor
act.
the
strike
involved
all
parties
concede
is
a
legal
strike
arising
out
of
the
railway
labor
act.
it's
a
strike
concerning
proposed
changes
and
working
conditions,
rules
and
rights
of
pay,
all
the
procedures
of
the
railway
labor
act
concededly
were
exhausted.
now,
the
three
petitioner
union,
petitioners
that
are
involved
in
this
case
are
the
brotherhood
of
railroad
trainmen,
the
order
of
railway
conductors
and
the
brotherhood
of
locomotive
firemen
and
enginemen,
all
unions
that
represent
railroad
employees
who
actually
operate
trains.
those
unions
went
on
strike
against
the
florida
east
coast
railroad
in
april
of
1966
and
within
the
few
weeks
following
the
beginning
of
that
strike,
the
picketing
that
was
here
involved
commenced.
the
picketing
was
peaceful
and
orderly
and
it
went
on
for
a
period
of
only
a
few
hours
when
it
was
enjoined
in
a
suit
brought
by
the
respondent
in
this
case
in
the
united
states
district
court
in
jacksonville.
that
court
issued
the
temporary
restraining
order
which
it
subsequently
converted
into
a
preliminary
injunction.
that
injunction
was
appealed
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
which
vacated
the
injunction
in
may
of
1966.
the
respondents
then
properly
filed
an
application
to
reinstate
the
injunction
in
this
court
and
this
court
expedited
the
time
for
filing
the
petition
for
cert
and
reinstated
the
injunction
over
the
summarizes
and
set
the
case
down
for
hearing
in
october
of
1966,
at
which
time,
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit,
the
opinion
of
chief
judge
tuttle
of
that
court
was
affirmed
by
divided
vote,
equally
divided.
now,
the
picketing
that
is
here
involved
is
picketing
that
concerns
for
the
east
coast
certainly
and
also
the
respondent,
jacksonville
terminal
company
and
therefore
it
is
we
submit
a
crucial
importance
to
examine
the
relationship
between
those
two.
in
jacksonville,
the
florida
with
the
--
which
is
the
northern
terminals
of
the
florida
east
coast.
there
is
the
jacksonville
terminal
company
which
is
jointly
owned
by
the
florida
east
coast
railroad
together
with
the
atlantic
coastline
and
the
seaboard
and
the
southern
railways.
mr.
neal
p.
rutledge
that's
correct.
mr.
neal
p.
rutledge
that's
--
that's
correct.
in
other
words,
the
holding
of
that
court
as
i
understand
it
was
that
the
norris-laguardia
act
precluded
the
injunction
in
this
case
because
it
arose
out
of
and
involved
a
labor
dispute.
mr.
neal
p.
rutledge
there
were
other
contentions
raised
before
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
neal
p.
rutledge
specifically
the
contention
that
we
raised
here
that
this
is
a
case
arguably
subject
to
the
national
labor
relations
act
but
the
court
did
not
pass
on
that.
the
jacksonville
terminal
company
as
i
say
is
owned
by
the
florida
east
coast
and
its
operations
are
controlled
by
a
document
which
was
approved
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
called
and
operating
in
guarantee
agreement
which
is
in
evidence
in
this
case
and
which
in
essence
is
a
document
which
spells
out
a
joint
venture
by
the
four
owning
railroads,
whereby,
each
one
is
entitled
to
use
without
discrimination
and
own
an
equal
basis
all
of
the
facilities
and
to
receive
the
labor
services
of
the
employees
of
the
terminal
company.
operating
under
this
agreement,
the
florida
east
coast
regularly
runs
its
trains
under
the
terminal
company
and
that
is
the
only
way
that
it
is
able
to
receive
deliveries
from
other
railroads
or
make
deliveries
to
other
railroads
at
its
northern
terminals
and
very
significantly
on
those
premises
of
the
jacksonville
terminal
company.
the
fec
regularly
and
on
a
regular
basis,
daily
basis
receives
essential
labor
services
performed
for
it
by
the
employees
of
the
jacksonville
terminal
company.
i
think
the
best
illustration
of
that
is
shown
in
the
record
at
page
99
where
the,
mr.
jennette,
the
president
and
general
manager
of
the
jacksonville
terminal
company
formally
advises
the
general
chairman
of
one
of
these
unions
and
as
follows.
he
says,
“jacksonville
terminal
company
employees
represented
by
the
order
of
railway
telegraphers
by
expected
to
perform
service
toward
the
florida
east
coast
railway
company
in
line
with
their
previously
assigned
duties
and
you
are
requested
to
join
with
me
in
seeing
that
the
order
of
this
high
court
is
carried
out
so
that
this
employees
of
the
terminal
company
are
daily
performing
labor
services
for
the
struck
carrier.”
now,
it
is
significant
we
submit
to
examine
in
detail
the
nature
of
the
picketing
here
which
is
cast
in
two
lights,
one
by
us
of
course
and
the
other
by
the
respondents.
the
respondents
throughout
their
brief
and
throughout
this
case
and
throughout
the
federal
court
case
have
contended
that
this
picketing
is
secondary
picketing
whatever
that
means.
it
is
significant
in
this
respect
however
to
note
that
our
picketing
was
limited
exclusively
to
points
around
the
perimeter
of
the
terminal
company
where
either
jacksonville
terminal
company
employees
reported
for
work.
in
other
words,
reported
to
begin
their
day
in
which
they
would
be
asked
to
do
labor
services
for
this
struck
carrier
or
to
entrances
where
employees
of
connecting
carriers
would
come
under
the
premises
either
to
make
delivery
to
or
take
delivery
from
the
florida
east
coast
railway
and
there
is
one
particular
crossing,
the
denis
street
crossing
which
is
referred
to
in
here
which
we
did
not
picket,
there
is
no
evidence
of
our
picketing
of
that
crossing.
there
was
a
dirt
road
next
to
it
that
we
picketed
which
was
a
place
for
jacksonville
terminal
company
employees
came
on
the
premises
but
the
denis
street
crossing
which
was
used
exclusively
by
the
atlantic
coastline
for
movement
was
not
picketed
and
we
submit
that
this
is
significant
in
showing
that
we
were
not
here
going
to
the
atlantic
coastline
railroad
and
saying,
“look,
we
want
you
to
stop
making
deliveries
to
the
fec
and
picketing
the
atlantic
coastline
wherever
it
operated
in
order
to
put
pressure
on
it
to
stop
doing
business.”
we
were
picketing
as
close
as
we
could
to
the
actual
site
where
work
was
being
performed
before
the
fec
or
where
deliveries
were
being
made
to
or
taken
from
the
fec.
now,
under
these
--
this
situation,
the
federal
court
in
litigation
as
it
proceeded
as
very
rapid
form
begun
in
may
of
19
--
the
picketing
actually
begun
in
may,
may
5th
of
1966
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
vacated
the
injunction.
a
matter
of
weeks
later,
that
same
month
in
may
of
1966
and
after
the
injunction
was
vacated
and
while
the
respondent
was
applying
to
this
court
to
reinstate
the
injunction,
the
respondent
filed
the
state
court
suit
in
the
court
of
general
state
court
jurisdiction
--
court
of
general
jurisdiction
in
jacksonville.
that
court
after
hearing
testimony
over
the
memorial
weekend,
may
30th,
entered
a
preliminary
injunction.
we
sought
a
writ
of
prohibition
in
the
florida
appellate
court
contending
that
state
court
had
no
jurisdiction.
that
was
denied,
we
came
to
this
court
to
petition
for
cert
reviewing
the
order
of
the
intermediate
appellate
court
and
that
petition
for
cert
was
denied.
meanwhile,
the
state
court
case
proceeded
on
to
final
hearing,
a
permanent
injunction
was
entered
in
july
of
1966,
that
was
appealed
to
the
intermediate
florida
court
that
injunction
was
affirmed
and
the
florida
supreme
court
refuse
to
review
it.
the
holding
of
the
florida
court
was
that
the
picketing
here
involved
was
illegal
under
florida
state
laws,
primarily
two
florida
statutes.
one,
a
little
sherman
act,
and
one,
a
little
interstate
commerce
act
regulating
for
local
florida
business
relations
and
was
also
illegal
under
florida
common
law
--
labor
law
which
according
to
the
court
makes
illegal
under
florida
law
any
secondary
boycotts.
significantly,
the
florida
state
court
did
not
rely
on
either
the
florida
statute
which
regulates
public
utility
labor
relations
and
which
provides
for
compulsory
arbitration
because
the
florida
legislature
in
passing
that
law
had
expressly
exempted
railroads
and
employees
covered
by
the
railway
labor
act.
significantly,
the
florida
court
did
not
rely
on
the
expressed
florida
statute
that
regulates
labor
relations
generally
in
florida
because
that
statute
also
expressly
exempts
that
the
railroads
or
any
industry
airlines
covered
by
the
railway
labor
act
and
their
employees.
now,
the
questions
that
are
posed
for
this
court,
initially,
the
underlying
question
in
this
case
is
whether
federal
law
or
state
law
governs
the
conduct
here
involved.
if
federal,
then
the
question
has
to
be
reached
as
to
whether
this
conduct
is
legal
or
illegal
under
federal
law
and
in
addition,
i
--
we
would
submit,
the
question
has
to
be
reached
as
to
whether
the
norris-laguardia
act
applies
to
a
state
court
which
is
adjudicating
a
labor
dispute
case
controlled
by
federal
law.
is
such
a
court
under
those
circumstances
a
court
of
the
united
states
covered
either
expressly
by
the
norris-laguardia
act
or
is
it
in
any
event
a
court
which
must
apply
the
principles
of
the
norris-laguardia
because
these
are
the
principles
of
controlling
federal
law.
if
on
the
other
hand
this
court
should
decide
that
state
law
applies
here,
then
the
question
must
be
presented,
be
raised,
face
we
submit
squarely
as
to
whether
or
not
this
is
a
case
which
is
arguably
subject
to
the
exclusive
primary
jurisdiction
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
and
that
therefore,
under
the
san
diego
building
trade
versus
gardner
in
the
gardner
decision
and
the
many
progeny
of
those
decisions,
the
state
court
lack
jurisdiction
to
even
try
the
case,
much
less,
to
enter
the
injunction.
underlying
the
entire
case
is
the
contention
raised
in
the
trial
court,
passed
upon
by
the
state
courts
that
the
conduct
involved
in
this
case
is
protected
conduct
by
the
first
and
the
fourteenth
amendment.
in
this
regard,
it
is
important
to
note
that
the
trial
court
made
a
finding
in
this
case
that
there
was
absolutely
no
force,
violence,
treat
of
violence,
mass
picketing
or
any
untoward
incident
of
any
sort
involved
in
the
picketing.
it
was
peaceful,
it
was
orderly,
there
were
single
pickets
stationed
at
various
places
around
a
perimeter
of
miles
and
there
was
no
kind
of
violence
or
blockage
of
traffic
or
interference
in
any
way
with
peace
and
order
of
the
state.
petitioners
contend
that
federal
law
controls
here
and
that
that
federal
law
makes
the
conduct
here
involved
legal
and
that
therefore,
the
decision
below
must
be
reversed
and
remanded
in
order
that
the
case
be
adjudicated
in
accordance
with
the
controlling
principles
of
federal
law.
the
problem
here
is
what
is
and
what
is
not
legal
picketing
in
a
strike
arising
out
of
a
railway
labor
act
major
dispute.
which
picketing
is
entirely
peaceful
and
does
not
entrench
on
any
of
the
areas
of
prime
state
concern
of
preserving
the
law
and
order
and
peace.
congress
has
regulated
labor
relations
in
the
railroad
industry
since
1888.
it
would
we
submit
be
anomalous
indeed
to
have
a
situation
where
in
interstate
and
industry
generally
which
has
not
been
regulated
by
congress
--
where
the
labor
relations
have
not
been
regulated
by
congress
since
19
--
until
1935
and
where
the
type
of
the
regulation
is
neither
so
extensive,
so
detailed
or
so
integrated.
it
would
be
anomalous
to
say
that
those
labor
relations
are
completely
preempted
by
federal
law
but
that
the
labor
relations
in
the
railroad
industry
which
is
directly
in
interstate
commerce
not
merely
affecting
it.
that
those
labor
relations
have
not
been
preempted
and
are
subject
to
varying
state
policies,
50
different
policies
and
particularly
was
--
mr.
neal
p.
rutledge
it
was
removed
your
honor
to
the
u.s.
district
court
where
the
federal
case
was
pending
and
was
remanded
back
to
the
state
court.
mr.
neal
p.
rutledge
on
the
basis
of
lack
of
jurisdiction.
mr.
neal
p.
rutledge
we
had
no
way
to
challenge
it
your
honor.
it
was
not
on
appeal
with
the
lawyer.
mr.
neal
p.
rutledge
and
we
did
seek
prohibition
against
the
state
court's
proceedings
and
--
mr.
neal
p.
rutledge
excuse
me?
mr.
neal
p.
rutledge
the
basis,
the
contention
was
that
the
state
court
suit
was
a
suit
purely
to
enforce
local
florida
law
and
that
the
federal
court
even
though
it
had
a
case
involving
this
identical
conduct
and
in
that
case
allegations
concerning
the
local
law
were
made
except
that
there
was
no
--
no
jurisdiction.
mr.
neal
p.
rutledge
the
--
no,
i
don't
think
that
the
court
necessarily
reached
the
merits
of
it.
i
think
the
court
simply
looked
at
the
complaint
and
said,
these
are
the
allegations
and
under
these
allegations
and
i
have
no
jurisdiction.
mr.
neal
p.
rutledge
excuse
me
your
honor?
mr.
neal
p.
rutledge
well,
the
complaint
that
was
filed
scrupulously
stayed
away
from
federal
law
and
the
judge
mcrae
who
remanded
the
case
from
the
federal
court
back
to
state
courts
said
he
could
not
anticipate
federal
questions
that
might
be
raised
in
the
outset
and
there
is
doctrine
of
cases
to
that
effect
which
he
relied
upon.
we
submit
that
in
deciding
which
law
applies
here,
state
or
federal
that
this
is
again
a
situation
such
mr.
justice
holmes
referred
to
were
at
page
of
history
is
worth
a
volume
or
logic
and
the
history
here,
its
quite
clear
that
in
--
with
passage
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
in
the
late
1880's
and
passage
of
the
sherman
act
in
the
1890's.
the
very
kind
of
conduct
that
is
here
involved
was
subjected
to
federal
control
and
there
are
series
of
cases
following
enactment
of
those
federal
statutes
which
--
in
which
rulings
were
obtained
that
the
type
of
picketing
that
is
here
involved,
in
other
words,
picketing,
seeking
to
interrupt
an
exchange
of
cars
between
two
railroads
was
illegal
conduct.
the
history
following
those
decisions
of
the
passage
of
the
clayton
act
in
1940
and
the
norris-laguardia
act
in
1932,
the
railway
labor
act
in
1926
and
1932,
the
wagner
act
and
the
taft-hartley
act
and
the
landrum-griffin
act,
we
submit,
shows
that
congress
has
repeatedly
taken
under
consideration
whether
to
make
this
kind
of
conduct
legal
or
not
legal
and
it
has
on
a
pragmatic
basis
pass
laws
which
although
originally
making
the
kind
of
conduct
here
illegal
from
1914
or
at
least
from
1932
on
legalized
this
kind
of
conduct
and
that
the
state
of
florida
cannot
by
its
law
make
illegal
that
which
congress
in
regulating
the
railroad
industry
has
deliberately
made
legal.
mr.
neal
p.
rutledge
yes
your
honor.
the
legislative
history
of
the
clayton
act,
the
frustration
of
what
the
proponents
of
the
clayton
act
felt
was
its
purpose
by
this
court's
decision
in
the
deering
case
that
then
the
legislative
history
of
the
norris-laguardia
act,
then
the
passage
of
the
taft-hartley
act
in
1947
in
which
the
legislative
colloquy
and
setout
in
our
brief
in
which
senator
taft
said
that
with
passage
of
the
clayton
and
norris-laguardia
act,
it
became
impossible
to
stop
a
secondary
boycott
and
that
the
purpose
of
taft-hartley
was
to
make
secondary
boycotts
in
businesses
affecting
interstate
commerce
illegal
and
then
the
question
came
up,
“well,
what
about
in
the
railroad
industry?”
and
the
colloquy
there
was
that
--
well,
through
the
same
situation
here,
in
other
words
with
passage
with
the
clayton
act
and
the
norris-laguardia
act,
secondary
boycotts
did
not
become
illegal
and
--
mr.
neal
p.
rutledge
no,
no
your
honor.
the
reference
that
we
cited
was
a
colloquy
as
to
whether
the
passage
of
taft-hartley
regulating
type
of
picketing
which
could
be
called
secondary,
should
be
applicable
to
the
railroad
industry
and
the
railroad
employees.
and
then
there
in
addition
to
that,
there
is
legislative
history
in
1959
as
to
whether
congress
in
'59
meant
to
apply
secondary
boycotts
to
railroad
workers
and
we
submit
that
that
congress
has
had
this
before.
there
is
no
question
that
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
the
delves
case
and
in
the
many
cases
of
that
era
that
any
kind
of
picketing
that
interfered
with
interchanged
railroad
cars
was
illegal
as
an
interference
with
interstate
commerce,
is
a
restraint
of
trade
and
there
was
no
problem
of
the
federal
power
to
reach
because
you
were
dealing
with
the
railroad
industry
and
that
situation
was
expressly
changed
with
the
clayton
act
and
the
norris-laguardia
act
and
this
court's
decision
in
the
hudson
case
we
think
establishes
that
fact
that
the
intent
of
the
clayton
act
and
the
norris-laguardia
act
was
to
change
--
was
to
change
the
decision
of
this
court
in
duplex
theory
and
in
other
words,
was
to
adopt
the
view
of
the
descenters,
mr.
justice
brandeis
in
the
duplex
case
so
that
we
say
that
this
has
been
a
matter
of
a
very
close
federal
attention
over
in
congress
for
decades
and
that
for
the
state
now
to
come
in
and
thinker
with
the
balance
of
economic
power
that
congress
with
great
difficulty
has
reached
over
50
years,
60
years,
will
create
an
intolerable
situation
particularly
when
you
magnify
that
50
times,
particularly
when
you
have
in
this
era
this
large
mergers.
since
this
case
begun
for
example,
the
seaboard
and
the
coastline
have
merged.
there
is
a
merger
going
on
in
the
pacific
northwest
which
will
create
a
railroad
system
spanning
some
thousand
and
thousands
of
miles
and
if
you
have
we
submit
individual
state
legislatures
and
individual
state
courts
legislating
the
balance
of
economic
power
in
the
railroad
industry,
we
submit
it'll
create
chaos.
mr.
neal
p.
rutledge
that's
correct
your
honor,
that's
correct
and
as
mr.
justice
frankfurter
stated
in
his
descent
in
the
burley
case.
the
railroad
world
is
a
world
unto
itself
and
it
is
governed
by
a
law,
special
law
and
is
one
that
congress
with
great
care
has
developed
and
we
submit
that
this
is
the
kind
of
a
case
which
must
be
controlled
by
federal
law
deriving
its
source
from
the
many
federal
statutes,
the
clayton
act
and
norris-laguardia,
railway
labor
act
and
from
the
entire
scheme
of
those
statutes.
mr.
neal
p.
rutledge
that's
correct
your
honor.
we
--
our
basic
contention
in
this
case
is
that
conduct
involved
is
controlled
by
federal
law
and
that
federal
law
has
deliberately
legalized
this
type
of
conduct.
now,
we
don't
concede
in
this
that
what
we
are
doing
here
is
a
secondary
boycott
at
all.
first
of
all,
the
word
secondary
boycott
is
a
very
vague
one.
congress
has
never
used
it
in
any
of
its
labor
statutes.
what
it
means,
nobody
can
say
with
precision
but
what
it
--
what
the
idea
of
a
secondary
boycott
is
the
idea
of
what
happened
in
the
duplex
case.
you
have
manufacture
--
labor
union
has
a
dispute
with
the
manufacturer,
he
sells
to
a
costumer
a
hundred
miles
away
and
if
you
go
pick
up
the
costumer
in
order
to
keep
them
from
doing
business
with
the
prime
person,
that's
a
secondary
boycott,
we
don't
have
that
here.
here,
we
were
picketing
as
close
as
we
possibly
could
come
without
trespassing
to
the
actual
place
where
work
was
being
performed
for
the
prime
contractor
and
therefore
we
say
this
is
primary
conduct
and
not
secondary
but
even
if
its
secondary
--
mr.
neal
p.
rutledge
we
were
picketing
south
of
jacksonville
sir.
mr.
neal
p.
rutledge
that's
correct.
mr.
neal
p.
rutledge
yes
your
honor,
we
faced
injunctions
all
up
and
down
the
line
and
we've
had
litigation
which
is
cited
in
our
brief
in
which
the
state
courts
down
in
miami
have
accepted
that
this
--
that
they
don't
have
any
jurisdiction
but
the
state
court
in
jacksonville
refused
to
follow
the
(inaudible)
of
their
sister
court.
mr.
neal
p.
rutledge
yes,
there
was
a
claim.
mr.
neal
p.
rutledge
that's
in
the
brand,
that's
the
case
cited
in
our
brief,
its
for
brower
county
port
authority
versus
order
of
railway
telegraphers.
its
not
reported
and
since
it
was
a
trial
in
florida
trial
court's
decision,
its
only
reported
in
the
lrrm
but
it
appears
on
page
iv
or
brief.
so
that
--
and
there
was
of
course
picketing
at
cape
kennedy
which
was
enjoined
at
the
instance
of
the
national
labor
relations
board.
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
neal
p.
rutledge
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
neal
p.
rutledge
to
the
point
your
honor
that
of
the
--
mr.
neal
p.
rutledge
that
there
is
no
authority
--
mr.
neal
p.
rutledge
your
honor,
the
--
our
response
to
that
is
that
what
congress
has
deliberately
left
free
to
competing
economic
forces,
the
states
cannot
move
in
an
outlaw
and
as
senator
taft
stated
and
quoted,
“there
have
not
been
abuses
in
the
railroad
industry.”
when
there
are
abuses,
it
will
be
time
enough
and
i
don't
think
it
would
take
very
long
for
congress
to
act,
to
make
section
8
(b)
(4)
of
taft-hartley
applicable
to
railroad
unions.
that's
been
proposed,
it
could
be
passed
in
a
matter
of
days
by
congress
and
congress
has
acted
on
a
--
in
situations
in
the
railroad
industry
where
national
disputes
have
occurred.
it
set
up
the
--
just
recently
the
unprecedented
situation
of
compulsory
arbitration
on
working
conditions
prospectively.
so
we
say
that
this
certainly
isn't
a
matter
that's
beyond
completely
all
regulation
and
the
congress
has
left
this
kind
of
thing
free
and
that
congress
can
act
if
there
is
an
abuse.
i
would
like
to
say
--
point
out
also
in
rebuttal
that
the
decree
in
answer
to
question
of
--
for
mr.
justice
stewart,
counsel
has
stated
that
the
decree
here
did
not
prohibit
all
picketing
here
and
we
can
still
picket
at
the
reserve
gate,
we
can
and
the
decree
does
accept
that.
the
evidence
is
also
admitted
by
stipulation
that
that
reserve
gate
is
not
enforced.
people
go
in
there
who
are
not
fec
people,
fec
people
go
in
other
places
so
the
reserve
gate
we
say
is
in
a
loser
issue
here.
the
decree
does
prevent
us
from
picketing
where
the
fec
comes
on
there
so
the
decree
here
admitted
we
submit
must
be
construed
as
prohibiting
both
primary
and
secondary
if
you
can
see
that
this
is
secondary
and
we
don't.
picketing
now,
in
answer
to
question
from
mr.
justice
black,
counsel
for
respondent
stated
that
it
was
not
determinative
here
whether
this
picketing
be
deemed
secondary
or
primary
and
we
agree
that.
in
other
words,
what
counsel
for
respondent
is
saying
by
his
answer
to
that
question
is
that
the
states
have
power
to
regulate
peaceful
orderly
picketing
in
the
railroad
industry
regardless
of
whether
it's
secondary
or
not
secondary.
so
we
say
the
whole
question
here
about
whether
this
picketing
is
secondary
or
not
is
really
a
question
only
designed
to
appeal
to
the
emotions.
in
short,
we
say
that
if
this
picketing
is
to
be
called
secondary,
its
not
outlawed
by
the
controlling
law.
we
say
it
is
not
secondary
and
we
say
that
regardless
of
whether
you
call
it
secondary
or
not,
it
certainly
is
not
irresponsible
conduct.
it
is
conduct
which
was
designed
by
us
to
limit
as
closely
as
we
could
the
effect
of
this
peaceful
economic
action
to
the
party
that
we
have
to
dispute
with
the
fec
and
in
that
regard,
i
would
like
to
correct
if
i
may
what
was
referred
to
in
respondent's
brief
as
an
inadvertent
implication
on
part.
it
was
not
an
inadvertent
implication.
footnote
12
page
10
of
the
brief,
respondent
says
that
we
inadvertently
imply
that
we
had
proposed
ways
to
limit
this
picketing
to
make
adjustments
in
other
words
so
that
this
picketing
would
be
limited
to
only
fec
movement.
now,
it
should
be
remembered
that
the
picketing
begun
in
the
early
morning
hours
and
that
within
hours
after
that,
everybody
responsibly
concerned
with
it
was
in
court
trying
a
federal
court
case
on
a
tro
and
the
tro
issued
that
afternoon
so
that
the
picketing
here
only
went
on
a
few
hours
and
at
page
264,
when
that
injunction
was
lifted,
we
stated
on
the
record
in
this
case
our
willingness
to
make
any
kind
of
adjustment
possible
and
the
railroad
stated
that
it
was
possible
to
do
so.
thank
you.
mr.
neal
p.
rutledge
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
another
of
a
long
series
of
cases
that
have
come
before
this
court
with
increasing
frequency
in
this
century
which
poses
the
familiar
problem
of
state's
rights
on
the
one
hand
versus
federal
control
or
preemption
of
economic
relations
affecting
interstate
commerce.
this
is
the
second
appearance
before
this
court
of
this
case
in
the
sense
of
the
conduct
that
is
involved.
the
prior
case
came
up
through
the
federal
court
system.
it
arises
and
i
will
just
sketch
briefly
the
factual
situation.
it
arises
out
of
a
long
standing
strike
against
the
florida
east
coast
railroad
which
runs
in
florida
roughly
from
jacksonville
down
to
miami.
the
florida
east
coast
railroad
is
a
class
1
railroad
covered
by
the
interstate
commerce
act
and
the
railway
labor
act.
the
strike
involved
all
parties
concede
is
a
legal
strike
arising
out
of
the
railway
labor
act.
it's
a
strike
concerning
proposed
changes
and
working
conditions,
rules
and
rights
of
pay,
all
the
procedures
of
the
railway
labor
act
concededly
were
exhausted.
now,
the
three
petitioner
union,
petitioners
that
are
involved
in
this
case
are
the
brotherhood
of
railroad
trainmen,
the
order
of
railway
conductors
and
the
brotherhood
of
locomotive
firemen
and
enginemen,
all
unions
that
represent
railroad
employees
who
actually
operate
trains.
those
unions
went
on
strike
against
the
florida
east
coast
railroad
in
april
of
1966
and
within
the
few
weeks
following
the
beginning
of
that
strike,
the
picketing
that
was
here
involved
commenced.
the
picketing
was
peaceful
and
orderly
and
it
went
on
for
a
period
of
only
a
few
hours
when
it
was
enjoined
in
a
suit
brought
by
the
respondent
in
this
case
in
the
united
states
district
court
in
jacksonville.
that
court
issued
the
temporary
restraining
order
which
it
subsequently
converted
into
a
preliminary
injunction.
that
injunction
was
appealed
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
which
vacated
the
injunction
in
may
of
1966.
the
respondents
then
properly
filed
an
application
to
reinstate
the
injunction
in
this
court
and
this
court
expedited
the
time
for
filing
the
petition
for
cert
and
reinstated
the
injunction
over
the
summarizes
and
set
the
case
down
for
hearing
in
october
of
1966,
at
which
time,
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit,
the
opinion
of
chief
judge
tuttle
of
that
court
was
affirmed
by
divided
vote,
equally
divided.
now,
the
picketing
that
is
here
involved
is
picketing
that
concerns
for
the
east
coast
certainly
and
also
the
respondent,
jacksonville
terminal
company
and
therefore
it
is
we
submit
a
crucial
importance
to
examine
the
relationship
between
those
two.
in
jacksonville,
the
florida
with
the
--
which
is
the
northern
terminals
of
the
florida
east
coast.
there
is
the
jacksonville
terminal
company
which
is
jointly
owned
by
the
florida
east
coast
railroad
together
with
the
atlantic
coastline
and
the
seaboard
and
the
southern
railways.
mr.
neal
p.
rutledge
that's
correct.
mr.
neal
p.
rutledge
that's
--
that's
correct.
in
other
words,
the
holding
of
that
court
as
i
understand
it
was
that
the
norris-laguardia
act
precluded
the
injunction
in
this
case
because
it
arose
out
of
and
involved
a
labor
dispute.
mr.
neal
p.
rutledge
there
were
other
contentions
raised
before
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
neal
p.
rutledge
specifically
the
contention
that
we
raised
here
that
this
is
a
case
arguably
subject
to
the
national
labor
relations
act
but
the
court
did
not
pass
on
that.
the
jacksonville
terminal
company
as
i
say
is
owned
by
the
florida
east
coast
and
its
operations
are
controlled
by
a
document
which
was
approved
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
called
and
operating
in
guarantee
agreement
which
is
in
evidence
in
this
case
and
which
in
essence
is
a
document
which
spells
out
a
joint
venture
by
the
four
owning
railroads,
whereby,
each
one
is
entitled
to
use
without
discrimination
and
own
an
equal
basis
all
of
the
facilities
and
to
receive
the
labor
services
of
the
employees
of
the
terminal
company.
operating
under
this
agreement,
the
florida
east
coast
regularly
runs
its
trains
under
the
terminal
company
and
that
is
the
only
way
that
it
is
able
to
receive
deliveries
from
other
railroads
or
make
deliveries
to
other
railroads
at
its
northern
terminals
and
very
significantly
on
those
premises
of
the
jacksonville
terminal
company.
the
fec
regularly
and
on
a
regular
basis,
daily
basis
receives
essential
labor
services
performed
for
it
by
the
employees
of
the
jacksonville
terminal
company.
i
think
the
best
illustration
of
that
is
shown
in
the
record
at
page
99
where
the,
mr.
jennette,
the
president
and
general
manager
of
the
jacksonville
terminal
company
formally
advises
the
general
chairman
of
one
of
these
unions
and
as
follows.
he
says,
“jacksonville
terminal
company
employees
represented
by
the
order
of
railway
telegraphers
by
expected
to
perform
service
toward
the
florida
east
coast
railway
company
in
line
with
their
previously
assigned
duties
and
you
are
requested
to
join
with
me
in
seeing
that
the
order
of
this
high
court
is
carried
out
so
that
this
employees
of
the
terminal
company
are
daily
performing
labor
services
for
the
struck
carrier.”
now,
it
is
significant
we
submit
to
examine
in
detail
the
nature
of
the
picketing
here
which
is
cast
in
two
lights,
one
by
us
of
course
and
the
other
by
the
respondents.
the
respondents
throughout
their
brief
and
throughout
this
case
and
throughout
the
federal
court
case
have
contended
that
this
picketing
is
secondary
picketing
whatever
that
means.
it
is
significant
in
this
respect
however
to
note
that
our
picketing
was
limited
exclusively
to
points
around
the
perimeter
of
the
terminal
company
where
either
jacksonville
terminal
company
employees
reported
for
work.
in
other
words,
reported
to
begin
their
day
in
which
they
would
be
asked
to
do
labor
services
for
this
struck
carrier
or
to
entrances
where
employees
of
connecting
carriers
would
come
under
the
premises
either
to
make
delivery
to
or
take
delivery
from
the
florida
east
coast
railway
and
there
is
one
particular
crossing,
the
denis
street
crossing
which
is
referred
to
in
here
which
we
did
not
picket,
there
is
no
evidence
of
our
picketing
of
that
crossing.
there
was
a
dirt
road
next
to
it
that
we
picketed
which
was
a
place
for
jacksonville
terminal
company
employees
came
on
the
premises
but
the
denis
street
crossing
which
was
used
exclusively
by
the
atlantic
coastline
for
movement
was
not
picketed
and
we
submit
that
this
is
significant
in
showing
that
we
were
not
here
going
to
the
atlantic
coastline
railroad
and
saying,
“look,
we
want
you
to
stop
making
deliveries
to
the
fec
and
picketing
the
atlantic
coastline
wherever
it
operated
in
order
to
put
pressure
on
it
to
stop
doing
business.”
we
were
picketing
as
close
as
we
could
to
the
actual
site
where
work
was
being
performed
before
the
fec
or
where
deliveries
were
being
made
to
or
taken
from
the
fec.
now,
under
these
--
this
situation,
the
federal
court
in
litigation
as
it
proceeded
as
very
rapid
form
begun
in
may
of
19
--
the
picketing
actually
begun
in
may,
may
5th
of
1966
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
vacated
the
injunction.
a
matter
of
weeks
later,
that
same
month
in
may
of
1966
and
after
the
injunction
was
vacated
and
while
the
respondent
was
applying
to
this
court
to
reinstate
the
injunction,
the
respondent
filed
the
state
court
suit
in
the
court
of
general
state
court
jurisdiction
--
court
of
general
jurisdiction
in
jacksonville.
that
court
after
hearing
testimony
over
the
memorial
weekend,
may
30th,
entered
a
preliminary
injunction.
we
sought
a
writ
of
prohibition
in
the
florida
appellate
court
contending
that
state
court
had
no
jurisdiction.
that
was
denied,
we
came
to
this
court
to
petition
for
cert
reviewing
the
order
of
the
intermediate
appellate
court
and
that
petition
for
cert
was
denied.
meanwhile,
the
state
court
case
proceeded
on
to
final
hearing,
a
permanent
injunction
was
entered
in
july
of
1966,
that
was
appealed
to
the
intermediate
florida
court
that
injunction
was
affirmed
and
the
florida
supreme
court
refuse
to
review
it.
the
holding
of
the
florida
court
was
that
the
picketing
here
involved
was
illegal
under
florida
state
laws,
primarily
two
florida
statutes.
one,
a
little
sherman
act,
and
one,
a
little
interstate
commerce
act
regulating
for
local
florida
business
relations
and
was
also
illegal
under
florida
common
law
--
labor
law
which
according
to
the
court
makes
illegal
under
florida
law
any
secondary
boycotts.
significantly,
the
florida
state
court
did
not
rely
on
either
the
florida
statute
which
regulates
public
utility
labor
relations
and
which
provides
for
compulsory
arbitration
because
the
florida
legislature
in
passing
that
law
had
expressly
exempted
railroads
and
employees
covered
by
the
railway
labor
act.
significantly,
the
florida
court
did
not
rely
on
the
expressed
florida
statute
that
regulates
labor
relations
generally
in
florida
because
that
statute
also
expressly
exempts
that
the
railroads
or
any
industry
airlines
covered
by
the
railway
labor
act
and
their
employees.
now,
the
questions
that
are
posed
for
this
court,
initially,
the
underlying
question
in
this
case
is
whether
federal
law
or
state
law
governs
the
conduct
here
involved.
if
federal,
then
the
question
has
to
be
reached
as
to
whether
this
conduct
is
legal
or
illegal
under
federal
law
and
in
addition,
i
--
we
would
submit,
the
question
has
to
be
reached
as
to
whether
the
norris-laguardia
act
applies
to
a
state
court
which
is
adjudicating
a
labor
dispute
case
controlled
by
federal
law.
is
such
a
court
under
those
circumstances
a
court
of
the
united
states
covered
either
expressly
by
the
norris-laguardia
act
or
is
it
in
any
event
a
court
which
must
apply
the
principles
of
the
norris-laguardia
because
these
are
the
principles
of
controlling
federal
law.
if
on
the
other
hand
this
court
should
decide
that
state
law
applies
here,
then
the
question
must
be
presented,
be
raised,
face
we
submit
squarely
as
to
whether
or
not
this
is
a
case
which
is
arguably
subject
to
the
exclusive
primary
jurisdiction
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
and
that
therefore,
under
the
san
diego
building
trade
versus
gardner
in
the
gardner
decision
and
the
many
progeny
of
those
decisions,
the
state
court
lack
jurisdiction
to
even
try
the
case,
much
less,
to
enter
the
injunction.
underlying
the
entire
case
is
the
contention
raised
in
the
trial
court,
passed
upon
by
the
state
courts
that
the
conduct
involved
in
this
case
is
protected
conduct
by
the
first
and
the
fourteenth
amendment.
in
this
regard,
it
is
important
to
note
that
the
trial
court
made
a
finding
in
this
case
that
there
was
absolutely
no
force,
violence,
treat
of
violence,
mass
picketing
or
any
untoward
incident
of
any
sort
involved
in
the
picketing.
it
was
peaceful,
it
was
orderly,
there
were
single
pickets
stationed
at
various
places
around
a
perimeter
of
miles
and
there
was
no
kind
of
violence
or
blockage
of
traffic
or
interference
in
any
way
with
peace
and
order
of
the
state.
petitioners
contend
that
federal
law
controls
here
and
that
that
federal
law
makes
the
conduct
here
involved
legal
and
that
therefore,
the
decision
below
must
be
reversed
and
remanded
in
order
that
the
case
be
adjudicated
in
accordance
with
the
controlling
principles
of
federal
law.
the
problem
here
is
what
is
and
what
is
not
legal
picketing
in
a
strike
arising
out
of
a
railway
labor
act
major
dispute.
which
picketing
is
entirely
peaceful
and
does
not
entrench
on
any
of
the
areas
of
prime
state
concern
of
preserving
the
law
and
order
and
peace.
congress
has
regulated
labor
relations
in
the
railroad
industry
since
1888.
it
would
we
submit
be
anomalous
indeed
to
have
a
situation
where
in
interstate
and
industry
generally
which
has
not
been
regulated
by
congress
--
where
the
labor
relations
have
not
been
regulated
by
congress
since
19
--
until
1935
and
where
the
type
of
the
regulation
is
neither
so
extensive,
so
detailed
or
so
integrated.
it
would
be
anomalous
to
say
that
those
labor
relations
are
completely
preempted
by
federal
law
but
that
the
labor
relations
in
the
railroad
industry
which
is
directly
in
interstate
commerce
not
merely
affecting
it.
that
those
labor
relations
have
not
been
preempted
and
are
subject
to
varying
state
policies,
50
different
policies
and
particularly
was
--
mr.
neal
p.
rutledge
it
was
removed
your
honor
to
the
u.s.
district
court
where
the
federal
case
was
pending
and
was
remanded
back
to
the
state
court.
mr.
neal
p.
rutledge
on
the
basis
of
lack
of
jurisdiction.
mr.
neal
p.
rutledge
we
had
no
way
to
challenge
it
your
honor.
it
was
not
on
appeal
with
the
lawyer.
mr.
neal
p.
rutledge
and
we
did
seek
prohibition
against
the
state
court's
proceedings
and
--
mr.
neal
p.
rutledge
excuse
me?
mr.
neal
p.
rutledge
the
basis,
the
contention
was
that
the
state
court
suit
was
a
suit
purely
to
enforce
local
florida
law
and
that
the
federal
court
even
though
it
had
a
case
involving
this
identical
conduct
and
in
that
case
allegations
concerning
the
local
law
were
made
except
that
there
was
no
--
no
jurisdiction.
mr.
neal
p.
rutledge
the
--
no,
i
don't
think
that
the
court
necessarily
reached
the
merits
of
it.
i
think
the
court
simply
looked
at
the
complaint
and
said,
these
are
the
allegations
and
under
these
allegations
and
i
have
no
jurisdiction.
mr.
neal
p.
rutledge
excuse
me
your
honor?
mr.
neal
p.
rutledge
well,
the
complaint
that
was
filed
scrupulously
stayed
away
from
federal
law
and
the
judge
mcrae
who
remanded
the
case
from
the
federal
court
back
to
state
courts
said
he
could
not
anticipate
federal
questions
that
might
be
raised
in
the
outset
and
there
is
doctrine
of
cases
to
that
effect
which
he
relied
upon.
we
submit
that
in
deciding
which
law
applies
here,
state
or
federal
that
this
is
again
a
situation
such
mr.
justice
holmes
referred
to
were
at
page
of
history
is
worth
a
volume
or
logic
and
the
history
here,
its
quite
clear
that
in
--
with
passage
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
in
the
late
1880's
and
passage
of
the
sherman
act
in
the
1890's.
the
very
kind
of
conduct
that
is
here
involved
was
subjected
to
federal
control
and
there
are
series
of
cases
following
enactment
of
those
federal
statutes
which
--
in
which
rulings
were
obtained
that
the
type
of
picketing
that
is
here
involved,
in
other
words,
picketing,
seeking
to
interrupt
an
exchange
of
cars
between
two
railroads
was
illegal
conduct.
the
history
following
those
decisions
of
the
passage
of
the
clayton
act
in
1940
and
the
norris-laguardia
act
in
1932,
the
railway
labor
act
in
1926
and
1932,
the
wagner
act
and
the
taft-hartley
act
and
the
landrum-griffin
act,
we
submit,
shows
that
congress
has
repeatedly
taken
under
consideration
whether
to
make
this
kind
of
conduct
legal
or
not
legal
and
it
has
on
a
pragmatic
basis
pass
laws
which
although
originally
making
the
kind
of
conduct
here
illegal
from
1914
or
at
least
from
1932
on
legalized
this
kind
of
conduct
and
that
the
state
of
florida
cannot
by
its
law
make
illegal
that
which
congress
in
regulating
the
railroad
industry
has
deliberately
made
legal.
mr.
neal
p.
rutledge
yes
your
honor.
the
legislative
history
of
the
clayton
act,
the
frustration
of
what
the
proponents
of
the
clayton
act
felt
was
its
purpose
by
this
court's
decision
in
the
deering
case
that
then
the
legislative
history
of
the
norris-laguardia
act,
then
the
passage
of
the
taft-hartley
act
in
1947
in
which
the
legislative
colloquy
and
setout
in
our
brief
in
which
senator
taft
said
that
with
passage
of
the
clayton
and
norris-laguardia
act,
it
became
impossible
to
stop
a
secondary
boycott
and
that
the
purpose
of
taft-hartley
was
to
make
secondary
boycotts
in
businesses
affecting
interstate
commerce
illegal
and
then
the
question
came
up,
“well,
what
about
in
the
railroad
industry?”
and
the
colloquy
there
was
that
--
well,
through
the
same
situation
here,
in
other
words
with
passage
with
the
clayton
act
and
the
norris-laguardia
act,
secondary
boycotts
did
not
become
illegal
and
--
mr.
neal
p.
rutledge
no,
no
your
honor.
the
reference
that
we
cited
was
a
colloquy
as
to
whether
the
passage
of
taft-hartley
regulating
type
of
picketing
which
could
be
called
secondary,
should
be
applicable
to
the
railroad
industry
and
the
railroad
employees.
and
then
there
in
addition
to
that,
there
is
legislative
history
in
1959
as
to
whether
congress
in
'59
meant
to
apply
secondary
boycotts
to
railroad
workers
and
we
submit
that
that
congress
has
had
this
before.
there
is
no
question
that
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
the
delves
case
and
in
the
many
cases
of
that
era
that
any
kind
of
picketing
that
interfered
with
interchanged
railroad
cars
was
illegal
as
an
interference
with
interstate
commerce,
is
a
restraint
of
trade
and
there
was
no
problem
of
the
federal
power
to
reach
because
you
were
dealing
with
the
railroad
industry
and
that
situation
was
expressly
changed
with
the
clayton
act
and
the
norris-laguardia
act
and
this
court's
decision
in
the
hudson
case
we
think
establishes
that
fact
that
the
intent
of
the
clayton
act
and
the
norris-laguardia
act
was
to
change
--
was
to
change
the
decision
of
this
court
in
duplex
theory
and
in
other
words,
was
to
adopt
the
view
of
the
descenters,
mr.
justice
brandeis
in
the
duplex
case
so
that
we
say
that
this
has
been
a
matter
of
a
very
close
federal
attention
over
in
congress
for
decades
and
that
for
the
state
now
to
come
in
and
thinker
with
the
balance
of
economic
power
that
congress
with
great
difficulty
has
reached
over
50
years,
60
years,
will
create
an
intolerable
situation
particularly
when
you
magnify
that
50
times,
particularly
when
you
have
in
this
era
this
large
mergers.
since
this
case
begun
for
example,
the
seaboard
and
the
coastline
have
merged.
there
is
a
merger
going
on
in
the
pacific
northwest
which
will
create
a
railroad
system
spanning
some
thousand
and
thousands
of
miles
and
if
you
have
we
submit
individual
state
legislatures
and
individual
state
courts
legislating
the
balance
of
economic
power
in
the
railroad
industry,
we
submit
it'll
create
chaos.
mr.
neal
p.
rutledge
that's
correct
your
honor,
that's
correct
and
as
mr.
justice
frankfurter
stated
in
his
descent
in
the
burley
case.
the
railroad
world
is
a
world
unto
itself
and
it
is
governed
by
a
law,
special
law
and
is
one
that
congress
with
great
care
has
developed
and
we
submit
that
this
is
the
kind
of
a
case
which
must
be
controlled
by
federal
law
deriving
its
source
from
the
many
federal
statutes,
the
clayton
act
and
norris-laguardia,
railway
labor
act
and
from
the
entire
scheme
of
those
statutes.
mr.
neal
p.
rutledge
that's
correct
your
honor.
we
--
our
basic
contention
in
this
case
is
that
conduct
involved
is
controlled
by
federal
law
and
that
federal
law
has
deliberately
legalized
this
type
of
conduct.
now,
we
don't
concede
in
this
that
what
we
are
doing
here
is
a
secondary
boycott
at
all.
first
of
all,
the
word
secondary
boycott
is
a
very
vague
one.
congress
has
never
used
it
in
any
of
its
labor
statutes.
what
it
means,
nobody
can
say
with
precision
but
what
it
--
what
the
idea
of
a
secondary
boycott
is
the
idea
of
what
happened
in
the
duplex
case.
you
have
manufacture
--
labor
union
has
a
dispute
with
the
manufacturer,
he
sells
to
a
costumer
a
hundred
miles
away
and
if
you
go
pick
up
the
costumer
in
order
to
keep
them
from
doing
business
with
the
prime
person,
that's
a
secondary
boycott,
we
don't
have
that
here.
here,
we
were
picketing
as
close
as
we
possibly
could
come
without
trespassing
to
the
actual
place
where
work
was
being
performed
for
the
prime
contractor
and
therefore
we
say
this
is
primary
conduct
and
not
secondary
but
even
if
its
secondary
--
mr.
neal
p.
rutledge
we
were
picketing
south
of
jacksonville
sir.
mr.
neal
p.
rutledge
that's
correct.
mr.
neal
p.
rutledge
yes
your
honor,
we
faced
injunctions
all
up
and
down
the
line
and
we've
had
litigation
which
is
cited
in
our
brief
in
which
the
state
courts
down
in
miami
have
accepted
that
this
--
that
they
don't
have
any
jurisdiction
but
the
state
court
in
jacksonville
refused
to
follow
the
(inaudible)
of
their
sister
court.
mr.
neal
p.
rutledge
yes,
there
was
a
claim.
mr.
neal
p.
rutledge
that's
in
the
brand,
that's
the
case
cited
in
our
brief,
its
for
brower
county
port
authority
versus
order
of
railway
telegraphers.
its
not
reported
and
since
it
was
a
trial
in
florida
trial
court's
decision,
its
only
reported
in
the
lrrm
but
it
appears
on
page
iv
or
brief.
so
that
--
and
there
was
of
course
picketing
at
cape
kennedy
which
was
enjoined
at
the
instance
of
the
national
labor
relations
board.
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
neal
p.
rutledge
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
neal
p.
rutledge
to
the
point
your
honor
that
of
the
--
mr.
neal
p.
rutledge
that
there
is
no
authority
--
mr.
neal
p.
rutledge
your
honor,
the
--
our
response
to
that
is
that
what
congress
has
deliberately
left
free
to
competing
economic
forces,
the
states
cannot
move
in
an
outlaw
and
as
senator
taft
stated
and
quoted,
“there
have
not
been
abuses
in
the
railroad
industry.”
when
there
are
abuses,
it
will
be
time
enough
and
i
don't
think
it
would
take
very
long
for
congress
to
act,
to
make
section
8
(b)
(4)
of
taft-hartley
applicable
to
railroad
unions.
that's
been
proposed,
it
could
be
passed
in
a
matter
of
days
by
congress
and
congress
has
acted
on
a
--
in
situations
in
the
railroad
industry
where
national
disputes
have
occurred.
it
set
up
the
--
just
recently
the
unprecedented
situation
of
compulsory
arbitration
on
working
conditions
prospectively.
so
we
say
that
this
certainly
isn't
a
matter
that's
beyond
completely
all
regulation
and
the
congress
has
left
this
kind
of
thing
free
and
that
congress
can
act
if
there
is
an
abuse.
i
would
like
to
say
--
point
out
also
in
rebuttal
that
the
decree
in
answer
to
question
of
--
for
mr.
justice
stewart,
counsel
has
stated
that
the
decree
here
did
not
prohibit
all
picketing
here
and
we
can
still
picket
at
the
reserve
gate,
we
can
and
the
decree
does
accept
that.
the
evidence
is
also
admitted
by
stipulation
that
that
reserve
gate
is
not
enforced.
people
go
in
there
who
are
not
fec
people,
fec
people
go
in
other
places
so
the
reserve
gate
we
say
is
in
a
loser
issue
here.
the
decree
does
prevent
us
from
picketing
where
the
fec
comes
on
there
so
the
decree
here
admitted
we
submit
must
be
construed
as
prohibiting
both
primary
and
secondary
if
you
can
see
that
this
is
secondary
and
we
don't.
picketing
now,
in
answer
to
question
from
mr.
justice
black,
counsel
for
respondent
stated
that
it
was
not
determinative
here
whether
this
picketing
be
deemed
secondary
or
primary
and
we
agree
that.
in
other
words,
what
counsel
for
respondent
is
saying
by
his
answer
to
that
question
is
that
the
states
have
power
to
regulate
peaceful
orderly
picketing
in
the
railroad
industry
regardless
of
whether
it's
secondary
or
not
secondary.
so
we
say
the
whole
question
here
about
whether
this
picketing
is
secondary
or
not
is
really
a
question
only
designed
to
appeal
to
the
emotions.
in
short,
we
say
that
if
this
picketing
is
to
be
called
secondary,
its
not
outlawed
by
the
controlling
law.
we
say
it
is
not
secondary
and
we
say
that
regardless
of
whether
you
call
it
secondary
or
not,
it
certainly
is
not
irresponsible
conduct.
it
is
conduct
which
was
designed
by
us
to
limit
as
closely
as
we
could
the
effect
of
this
peaceful
economic
action
to
the
party
that
we
have
to
dispute
with
the
fec
and
in
that
regard,
i
would
like
to
correct
if
i
may
what
was
referred
to
in
respondent's
brief
as
an
inadvertent
implication
on
part.
it
was
not
an
inadvertent
implication.
footnote
12
page
10
of
the
brief,
respondent
says
that
we
inadvertently
imply
that
we
had
proposed
ways
to
limit
this
picketing
to
make
adjustments
in
other
words
so
that
this
picketing
would
be
limited
to
only
fec
movement.
now,
it
should
be
remembered
that
the
picketing
begun
in
the
early
morning
hours
and
that
within
hours
after
that,
everybody
responsibly
concerned
with
it
was
in
court
trying
a
federal
court
case
on
a
tro
and
the
tro
issued
that
afternoon
so
that
the
picketing
here
only
went
on
a
few
hours
and
at
page
264,
when
that
injunction
was
lifted,
we
stated
on
the
record
in
this
case
our
willingness
to
make
any
kind
of
adjustment
possible
and
the
railroad
stated
that
it
was
possible
to
do
so.
thank
you.
