justice
byron
r.
white
was
this
case
subject
to
removal?
justice
byron
r.
white
on
what
basis?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
challenged
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh
i
see.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
was
the
basis
for
holding
no
jurisdiction?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
was
the
basis
for
there
was
lack
of
jurisdiction?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
federal
court
decided
contrary
to
what
you're
urging
here
is
to
the
applicable
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
wasn't
a
good
federal
question
allegation,
i
guess
you
--
justice
byron
r.
white
it
wasn't
a
good
federal
question
allegation?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
this
the
same
as
saying
--
is
it
--
are
you
just
saying
here
in
addition
that
federal
law
doesn't
control?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
couldn't
the
--
if
you
maybe
right
in
all
those
points
you
just
made
and
the
federal
law
can
still
control
and
you
still
have
the
question
left
to
what
the
federal
law
is.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
would
you
say
that
--
would
say
that
if
the
court
decided
the
federal
law
does
govern
in
this
case
that
you'd
lost
the
case?
