justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
there
something
specific
mr.
rutledge
which
you
say
evidences
of
congressional
determination
that
they
shall
believe?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
get
to.
there
was
explicit
reference
then
to
the
situation
of
picketing
for
the
purpose
of
stopping
and
interchange
of
cars
between
railroads?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather
from
what
i
read
this
morning,
there
are
corresponding
mergers
on
the
union
side.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i
gather
you
argue
that
even
if
you
fail
in
that
argument
that
nevertheless,
sufficiently
federal
law
that
norris-laguardia's
provision
either
explicit
or
the
basic
ones
should
be
applied
to
deny
state
court's
any
power
to
issue
injunctions
in
situations.
