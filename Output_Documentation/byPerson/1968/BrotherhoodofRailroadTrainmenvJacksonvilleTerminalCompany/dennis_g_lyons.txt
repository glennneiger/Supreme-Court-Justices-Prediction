mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
with
respect
to
the
facts
of
this
matter,
there
are
three
factual
questions
to
which
i
would
like
to
speak
a
little
further
than
counsel
for
the
petitioners
has.
those
three
questions
are,
first,
what
goes
on
in
the
terminal?
second,
what
was
the
conduct
of
the
petitioners?
third,
what
the
effect
of
that
conduct?
the
jacksonville
terminal,
its
name
rather
is
rather
a
misnomer.
the
jacksonville
terminal
is
not
simply
a
terminal,
a
place
where
train
movement
stop.
it
is
primarily
a
place
where
train
movements
go
through.
the
principle
main
line
of
the
atlantic
coastline
railroad
is
this
line
here,
this
blue
line
coming
down
going
through
the
terminal
properly
which
is
shown
in
green
and
exiting
here
into
the
south
being
shown
in
blue.
one
of
the
principle
main
lines
of
the
seaboard
railroad
is
this
line
coming
through
here
in
this
orange
line
coming
from
the
north
or
from
savannah
and
going
through
the
terminal
here
and
exiting
here
eventually
going
to
the
south.
the
terminal
stands
at
fort
the
main
lines
of
the
railroads
that
serve
the
state
of
florida.
if
you
cut
of
the
terminal
due
to
a
very
substantial
extent
cut
off
all
rail
service
to
and
from
peninsular
florida.
florida
is
a
peninsula,
there
is
basically
one
way
of
getting
into
it
by
land
from
the
north
and
accordingly
the
state
of
florida
is
highly
vulnerable
to
a
cutting
off
of
the
jacksonville
terminal.
we've
heard
a
great
deal
of
talk
about
the
work
done
for
the
fec
within
the
terminal.
to
put
into
perspective,
the
fec
uses
the
terminal
in
two
ways.
in
one
way,
its
freight
trains,
its
freight
cars
are
interchanged.
this
cars
are
brought
across
the
bridge
across
the
saint
john's
river,
so-called
the
cluster
bridge
up
from
the
fec
yard
which
are
down
about
another
12
miles
to
the
south
and
they
are
brought
here
by
their
crews
and
in
various
places
around
here
if
they
meet
the
carriers
to
whom
they
are
to
be
delivered
and
the
delivery
is
made,
similarly
in
the
pick
up,
the
cars
are
brought
into
the
terminal
or
elsewhere
around
the
perimeters
of
the
terminal
and
an
interchange
takes
place
and
the
cars
are
brought
back
down.
only
30%
of
the
interchange
movements
within
the
terminal
property
or
using
the
terminal
facilities
are
fec
connected.
so
in
one
side,
we
have
all
these
three
movements
which
are
for
the
account
of
the
none
struck
carriers,
the
seaboard,
the
coastline,
the
southern
terminal
company
itself,
none
of
which
has
any
labor
dispute
with
its
employees.
we
also
have
the
interchanges
which
do
involve
the
handling
of
the
cars
from
one
railroad
to
another,
only
30%
of
those
are
for
the
account
of
the
fec.
we
also
have
or
used
to
have
some
fec
passenger
train
activity
within
the
terminal.
the
other
carriers
run
42
trains
a
day,
passenger
trains
through
the
terminal,
the
none
struck
companies.
the
fec
run
two
cares,
two
passenger
trains
a
day
into
the
terminal
and
in
that
connection
they
receive
the
same
terminal
services,
the
selling
of
tickets,
the
washing
of
the
cars
that
the
other
none
struck
carriers
received.
these
passenger
movements
accounted
for
less
than
1%
of
the
total
passenger
cars
handled
through
the
terminal.
incidentally,
after
the
making
of
the
record
in
this
case
but
there
is
no
dispute
about
it,
the
fec
received
permission
to
suspend
all
passenger
service
and
so
according
to
them,
there
is
currently
no
use
whatsoever
of
the
terminal
by
the
fec's
passenger
trains.
now,
as
to
the
conduct
of
the
petitioners,
what
did
this
picketing
consist
of?
the
picketing
consisted
as
the
trial
court
found
of
the
placing
of
pickets
at
every
entrance
to
the
terminal,
every
entrance
by
rail,
by
road
or
on
foot.
the
trial
court's
finding
is
broad
enough
to
cover
the
entrance
of
denis
street
for
railways
there
where
only
main
line
movements
of
the
coastline
exit
and
enter.
it
is
undisputed
that
there
was
picketing
at
a.
corn
street
which
is
right
here
where
only
seaboard
mainline
movements
enter.
as
you
see,
we
need
to
distinguish
this,
a
copy
of
this
map
at
page
9
of
our
brief
of
the
seaboard's
terminal
movement
would
have
to
come
in
this
way
or
come
across
from
its
yards
and
come
in
this
way
of
this
line
cuts
right
across
the
terminal
and
its
used
by
the
mainline
trains
and
that
line
was
cut.
the
picket
signs
did
not
simply
say
please
don't
handle
fec
cars.
the
picket
signs
contained
two
exhortations
on
them.
the
first
exhortations
on
those
signs
was
do
not
cross
and
that
exhortation
was
lived
up
to.
the
railroad
men
honored
that
picket
sign,
they
did
not
cross
the
picket
line.
the
condition
and
it
was
stated
later
on
and
indeed
stated
in
papers
filed
in
this
court
by
counsel
was
that
the
solution
to
the
matter
was
the
placing
of
an
embargo
on
the
fec
by
the
other
carriers,
in
other
words,
a
refusal
to
handle
their
cars
but
the
appeal
that
the
pickets
made
to
the
employees
in
order
to
make
their
employers
hurt
enough
to
do
that
was
do
not
cross,
do
not
go
within
the
terminal.
the
effect
of
this
picketing
as
the
trial
court
found
on
very
ample
evidence
was
to
threaten
the
economic
strangulation
of
the
state
of
florida.
95%
of
the
u.s.
mail
passing
to
and
from
florida
comes
through
the
terminal.
if
the
terminal
were
shutdown
for
as
much
as
one
day,
it
would
six
days
to
catch
up
on
the
u.s.
mail.
a
very
substantial
portion
of
the
citrus
crop
and
of
the
other
basic
products
that
florida
exports,
the
phosphates
from
the
fields
in
florida
have
to
pass
through
the
terminal
if
they
are
going
to
move
by
rail
and
rail
is
one
of
their
primary
means
of
moving.
there
are
numerous
industries
that
have
settled
in
jacksonville
either
directly
adjacent
to
the
terminal
property
or
on
spurs
leading
off
from
the
terminal
property
where
cars
to
get
to
them
would
have
to
go
through
the
terminal
property
which
would
be
cut
off
from
all
rail
access
if
the
terminal
were
shutdown.
so
we
have
here
--
i
don't
purport
to
give
an
exhaustive
definition
of
secondary
picketing
but
i
think
if
anything
is
secondary
picketing,
the
conduct
here
was
secondary
picketing.
it
was
an
appeal
by
these
employees
of
the
fec
and
former
employees
of
the
fec,
two
other
carriers
employees
to
induce
them
to
stop
work
not
to
go
within
the
terminal
until
such
time
as
their
employers
saw
fit
to
stop
doing
business
with
the
fec.
now,
at
appropriate
time,
the
terminal
company
which
is
the
respondent
here
and
in
the
federal
case
the
other
none
struck
carriers
sued
both
in
the
federals
courts
and
after
a
finding
by
the
fifth
circuit
that
there
was
no
federal
court
jurisdiction
sued
in
the
state
court
for
an
injunction
against
this
conduct.
i
might
say
that
while
the
basis
if
remand
to
speak
to
the
question
that
mr.
justice
white
raised.
one
of
the
basis
on
which
the
remand
from
the
state
court,
from
the
federal
court
back
to
the
state
court
of
this
action
took
place
was
the
finding
of
he
fifth
circuit
that
there
was
no
federal
court
jurisdiction
in
that
the
norris-laguardia
act
precluded
federal
court
jurisdiction
and
that
was
one
of
the
basis
for
the
remand
by
judge
mcrae.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
i
suspect
not
your
honor
but
that
was
the
--
we
are
faced
also
with
the
fact
that
there
was
no
jurisdiction
in
the
federal
court
as
he
viewed
at
that
time
and
that
the
complaint
was
brought
solely
under
state
law
which
was
the
alternate
basis.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
the
judgment
was
the
judgment
of
the
fifth
circuit
to
the
effect
that
the
preliminary
injunction
out
of
the
federal
court
of
the
district
court
had
to
be
reversed
because
there
is
no
jurisdiction
in
the
federal
courts
by
reason
of
norris-laguardia.
that
was
the
fifth
circuit
judgment
which
was
a
judgment
in
favor
of
the
present
petitioners
which
was
affirmed.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
on
the
same
facts,
yes
your
honor.
so
it
has
been
held
that
there
is
no
jurisdiction
in
the
federal
courts
by
reason
of
norris-laguardia.
now,
whether
that
is
binding
very
purposes
in
this
present
case,
being
afforded
for
decision
is
a
matter.
this
case
comes
before
the
court
in
this
posture.
there
is
a
state
court
injunction
granted
under
state
law.
clearly
no
question
can
be
raised
with
respect
to
the
issues
of
state
law
in
this
court.
the
only
question
is
whether
there
are
some
basis
in
the
federal
law
either
in
the
federal
statutes
or
the
federal
constitution
that
precludes
the
state
courts
from
doing
what
they
did.
now,
the
petitioners
mentioned
five
or
six
basis,
i'll
try
and
take
them
up
in
order.
their
most
serious
basis
or
at
least
one
that
they
spend
the
most
time
on
is
that
by
reason
of
the
railway
labor
act
and
certain
other
statutes
regulating
railway
labor
relations,
they
refer
boiler
inspection
act
and
the
safety
appliance
act
which
don't
seem
to
have
much
to
do
with
the
case
but
by
reasons
of
this
federal
railway
labor
statutes,
there
is
a
supersession
of
state
law
and
of
state
court
jurisdiction
here
and
they
rely
for
analogy
on
this
court's
ruling
under
the
taft-hartley
act,
whereas,
we
know
in
a
long
line
of
case
after
the
passage
of
the
taft-hartley
and
after
particularly
the
addition
of
section
8
(b)
(4)
to
the
labor
management
relations
act
in
1947,
there
was
a
long
line
of
cases
in
this
court
holding
that
the
states
could
not
enjoin
conduct
which
was
either
arguably
prohibited
by
section
8
(b)
or
arguably
protected
by
section
7.
our
basic
contention
is
that
this
whole
line
of
argument
is
a
false
analogy.
there
is
simply
not
a
comparable
situation
here
between
the
taft-hartley
act
and
the
railway
labor
act.
under
the
taft-hartley
act,
you
have
a
detailed
code
of
the
sort
of
conduct
that
is
addressed
against
none
struck
employers
that
is
prohibited.
that
code
is
found
in
section
8
(b)
(4)
of
the
act,
a
very
lengthy,
a
very
involved
section.
it
is
also
found
in
section
8
(e)
of
the
act.
there
is
another
side
to
that
coin.
there
is
section
7
of
the
act
which
to
a
great
extent
says
that
conduct
which
is
not
prohibited
by
section
8
(b)
is
protected
under
section
7.
besides
that
very
detailed
substantive
code,
there
is
also
an
administrative
agency
which
is
charged
with
the
duty
of
adjudicating
matters
under
that
code
and
which
has
the
duty
of
drawing
the
dividing
line
in
the
place
where
congress
intended
it.
there
is
nothing
like
that
under
the
railway
labor
act.
there
is
no
regulation
whatsoever
--
no
regulation
whatsoever
under
the
railway
labor
act
of
the
sort
of
weapons
that
a
union
can
use
against
management
and
certainly
none
whatsoever
of
the
regulation
of
the
weapons
that
you
can
use
against
third
parties
to
labor
dispute.
and
while
there
are
certain
administrative
agencies
that
had
been
set
up
by
congress
under
the
railway
labor
act,
the
adjustment
board
and
the
mediation
board
and
the
ad
hoc
presidential
board
under
section
10,
there
is
no
administrative
agency
set
up
under
that
act
which
is
charged
with
the
duty
of
passing
on
whether
specific
union
weapons
or
specific
management
weapons
of
self-help
are
protected
or
prohibited.
this
is
an
area
in
which
congress
simply
has
not
moved.
and
our
contention
is
that
justice
in
the
case
that
was
decided
by
the
court
a
few
weeks
ago
involving
the
state
full
approval
of
this
that
there
is
room
for
concurrent
regulation
here
both
by
the
states
and
by
the
federal
government
in
an
area
where
the
federal
power
has
not
specifically
asserted
itself.
and
here,
the
federal
power
has
not
asserted
itself
by
regulating
the
sort
of
weapons
that
the
unions
can
use
and
particularly
the
sort
of
weapons
that
they
can
use
against
third
parties.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
there
is
no
general
law
against
picketing
in
the
state
of
florida
your
honor.
this
is
not
a
case
like
thornhill
were
they
simply
said
that
you
shall
not
picket.
the
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
i
don't
under
--
i
believe
that
there's
a
little
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
there
is
a
little
taft-hartley
act
or
there
is
a
state
labor
relations
act
in
florida
which
gives
workers
the
right
to
engage
in
concerted
activities.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
yes,
it
would
cover
that.
the
--
it
does
not
apply
directly
to
workers
in
the
railway
labor
field.
the
basis
of
the
injunction
here
was
the
state
common
law
against
secondary
boycotting.
this
was
not
--
the
injunction
was
not
passed
against
the
picketing
as
such,
it
was
passed
against
it
because
it
violated
state
substantive
law.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
no,
there
were
exemptions.
the
first
place
curiously
enough
the
petitioners
did
not
picket
at
the
main
rail
entrance
used
by
the
florida
east
coast
railroad.
the
picketing
is
permitted
at
the
reserve
gate
for
the
use
of
the
fec
employees.
there
has
been
a
reserve
gate
at
the
terminal
for
years
and
the
injunction
was
limited
and
did
not
cover
that
entrance
and
they
are
free
to
picket
there
at
which
post
free
to
picket
at
the
main
rail
entrance
and
of
course
free
to
picket
up
and
down
the
line
in
eastern
florida
where
the
fec
runs.
now,
my
argument
of
course
would
have
a
fallacy
in
it
if
we
could
deduce
a
basic
intention
by
congress
affirmatively
to
sanction
secondary
picketing
on
the
railroads.
in
other
words,
if
we
could
say
that
congress
wanted
to
protect
this
sort
of
conduct.
the
fact
that
it
hadn't
set
up
an
administrative
regime
which
was
designed
to
regulate
it
would
not
of
course
support
the
state
court
injunction.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
i
think
that's
an
issue,
i'm
not
sure
it's
a
disputative
issue.
i
think
--
i
feel
in
my
case
is
easier
if
it
was
and
i'm
sure
my
brother
feels
that
his
case
is
easier
if
it
was
not.
just
in
terms
of
the
--
i
suppose
the
fact
that
cases
like
the
caboni
case
back
in
the
1940's
seem
to
hold
that
states
have
a
very
definite
and
very
recognizable
interest
with
respect
to
preventing
the
extension
of
labor
disputes
to
persons
who
are
not
party
list
to
them
through
the
application
of
their
antitrust
laws
such
as
was
done
here
or
through
the
application
of
other
valid
state
statutes
and
i
think
that
does
affect
the
issues
though
i
would
not
say
that
it
was
disputative
of
them.
we
contend
that
there
is
absolutely
no
evidence
that
congress
ever
intended
affirmatively
to
sanction
the
use
of
the
secondary
boycott
on
the
railroad
industry.
the
petitioners
as
i
understand
it
point
to
approximately
four
statutes.
the
clayton
act,
first,
under
which
it
was
held
that
the
secondary
boycott
was
not
lawful.
the
norris-laguardia
act
which
in
its
terms
only
regulates
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts.
the
third
and
to
me
the
most
amazing
is
their
reference
to
the
legislative
history
of
the
taft-hartley
act
in
which
they
appear
to
contend
that
congress
declined
to
outlaw
the
secondary
boycott
on
the
railroads
because
they
thought
that
the
secondary
boycott
was
a
good
thing.
the
entire
colloquy
and
we
printed
starting
at
around
page
45
of
our
brief
and
it's
a
discussion
by
senator
taft.
he
begins
by
saying
in
this
bill
we
prohibit
secondary
boycotts
all
over
the
country
and
then
one
of
the
other
senators
raised
a
question
and
said,
“well,
what
about
the
railroads,
why
do
you
not
prohibit
the
secondary
boycott
on
the
railroads?”
and
the
discussion
quoted
is
that
railway
workers
are
not
that
engaging
in
such
practices
and
that
there
was
no
abuse
here
and
no
need
for
congress
to
alter
the
scheme
of
the
labor
act
in
relation
to
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
we
quote
that
on
our
brief
starting
at
page
45.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
that's
precisely
at
page
48,
he
said,
“we
saw
no
reason
to
change
that
situation”
mr.
senator
taft
speaking,
because
there
were
no
abuses
which
had
a
reason
in
connection
with
the
operation
of
the
railway
labor
act.
indeed,
this
is
really
a
unique
case.
there
is
really
no
trusting
for
a
situation
like
this
in
which
there
is
a
picketing
of
the
none
struck
carriers
on
an
interchange
point.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
thank
you
your
honor.
before
recess,
we
were
developing
the
point
that
congress
never
affirmatively
sanctioned
the
use
of
secondary
conduct
against
none
struck
carriers
by
rail
unions.
and
we
discussed
the
history
of
the
taft-hartley
act.
the
paradox
in
what
the
petitioners
are
contending
for
if
congress
through
some
process
of
silence
or
some
process
of
silent
approval
of
this
form
of
extended
self-help
against
third
parties
made
this
conduct
lawful
in
this
context,
we
would
have
the
paradoxical
situation
in
which
it
would
be
unlawful
to
engage
in
this
conduct
in
an
industry
regulated
under
the
taft-hartley
act,
a
toy
factory,
a
candy
factory,
any
factory
producing
goods
for
interstate
commerce
in
the
jurisdictional
minimum
but
it
would
not
be
unlawful
to
practice
this
conduct
against
a
railroad,
against
an
instrumentality
of
interstate
commerce
against
one
of
the
more
vital
and
basic
of
american
industries.
i
think
really
the
point
needs
no
further
development.
there
is
no
evidence
whatsoever
that
congress
ever
put
its
stamp
of
approval
on
this
conduct.
congress
happened
not
to
regulate
this
conduct.
it
happened
not
to
provide
an
administrative
agency
for
its
regulation
but
that
does
not
mean
under
these
circumstances
that
it
meant
to
leave
it
completely
unregulated.
now,
there
are
three
further
basis
of
contention
that
that
petitioners
make.
they
contend
first
that
the
norris-laguardia
act,
second,
that
the
taft-hartley
act
and
third,
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
preclude
the
injunction
that
was
granted
here
by
the
state
courts.
i
will
give
our
responses
to
those
briefly
because
we
frankly
submit
that
this
are
make
weight
contentions.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
yes,
this
is
an
additional
basis
on
which
it
doesn't
control
the
other
statutes
that
the
petitioners
bring
in
with
on
somewhat
basis.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
well,
you
would.
the
--
well,
their
basis,
the
various
basis
that
we're
submitting
that
we
have
submitted
or
negations
of
the
applicability
of
federal
law
in
any
basis.
we
contend
that
it
doesn't
apply
because
of
the
railway
labor
act
and
it
doesn't
apply
because
of
the
taft-hartley
act.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
i
wouldn't
so
submit
your
honor
because
the
--
that
would
then
for
one
thing
throw
open
this
questions,
these
additional
questions.
first,
whether
the
norris-laguardia
act
would
have
to
be
applied
by
the
state
court
in
applying
the
federal
court.
second,
whether
the
norris-laguardia
act
prohibits
this
injunction
and
the
only
holding
on
this
is
the
four
to
four
decisions
by
this
court
which
of
course
is
not
a
binding
precedent.
on
that
we'd
submit
everything
that
we
said
before
and
that
would
--
those
would
be
our
submissions
even
if
the
federal
law
did
apply,
i
don't
think
it
necessarily
means
that
the
state
court
judgment
will
have
a
third
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
yes,
and
that
could
very
well
be
as
we
contended
in
the
other
case
where
we
sought
an
injunction
under
the
railway
labor
act
and
the
interstate
commerce
act
that
those
statutes
which
are
aimed
at
minimizing
the
conflict
on
the
railroads
and
trying
to
confine
industrial
disputes.
certainly
never
contemplated
that
there'd
be
any
secondary
boycott
against
a
none
struck
carrier,
just
to
person
who
never
had
advantage
of
the
processes
of
the
railway
labor
act
and
we
would
also
contend
for
the
reasons
that
we
contended
before
that
the
norris-laguardia
act
would
not
apply
even
if
this
case
were
govern
by
federal
law.
if
it's
governed
by
state
law
under
state
court,
we
submit
there
is
no
basis
whatsoever
for
saying
that
it
applies.
there
is
a
somewhat
different
argument
that
the
petitioners
make.
it
develops
that
the
petitioners
that
the
union
basically
did
the
picketing,
the
brotherhood
of
railroad
trainmen,
it
also
represents
bus
drivers.
7%
of
its
membership
are
bus
drivers
and
the
bus
drivers
of
course
had
nothing
to
do
with
this
dispute
and
they
are
not
in
the
lodges,
they
were
involved
in
this
picketing
but
the
petitioners
contend
that
it
is
therefore
arguable
that
the
national
labor
relations
board
has
jurisdiction.
now,
they
further
contend
that
it
does
not
have
jurisdiction
that
is
our
contention
too.
nobody
contends
that
the
national
labor
relations
board
has
jurisdiction
in
this
case.
but
they
submit
that
because
7%
of
their
membership
all
fund
these
other
lodges
or
bus
drivers
are
not
under
the
railway
labor
act
that
therefore
as
i
understand
it
in
every
case
involving
this
large
union
that
there
is
an
arguable
applicability
of
the
taft-hartley
act
and
that
accordingly,
the
state
courts
would
have
to
state
their
hand
and
i
will
assume
also
that
the
agency
is
set
up
under
the
railway
labor
act,
the
mediation
board
and
the
adjustment
board
would
be
in
the
same
posture.
we
think
that
to
state
that
sort
of
contention
is
really
to
answer
it
that
the
courts
have
generally
looked
to
the
particular
aspect
of
the
union
and
the
particular
aspect
of
the
work
that's
involved.
this
is
a
dispute
wholly
within
the
railroad
union,
railroad
industry.
the
brotherhoods
are
predominantly
railroad
brotherhoods.
they
are
predominantly
--
their
lodges
were
entirely
railroad
workers
and
the
employers
are
all
common
carriers,
we
submit
there
is
no
basis
arguable
or
otherwise
for
the
applicability
of
taft-hartley.
on
the
first
amendment
applicability,
our
contention
is
that
this
is
not
a
state
law
against
picketing,
this
is
a
state
law
against
specific
abuses
and
the
injunction
was
so
limited.
i
think
i
--
i
just
well
just
to
take
a
moment
to
see
what
it
is
that
the
petitioners
are
contending
for
in
this
case
before
this
court
this
morning.
if
they
prevail
this
morning,
they
will
have
established
that
there
is
no
agency
of
government
federal,
state
or
local,
traditional
or
administrative
that
can
regulate
their
conduct
then
applying
this
measure,
these
economic
warfare
measures
to
this
none
struck
carriers.
let
me
recap,
it
is
common
ground
i
believe
that
none
of
the
agencies
set
up
under
the
railway
labor
act
have
jurisdiction.
this
is
not
a
case
for
the
adjustment
board
or
for
the
mediation
board.
both
parties
agreed
that
the
labor
board
has
no
jurisdiction.
this
court
in
its
four
to
four
decision
in
1966
held
that
federal
courts
have
no
jurisdiction.
that
leaves
--
that
was
the
sole
basis
on
which
the
petitioners
conduct
can
be
regulated
or
if
it
is
not
applicable
left
wholly
unregulated
the
state
courts
and
it
is
that
last
avenue
of
relief
against
this
action
which
would
tie
up
the
entire
economy
of
florida
which
would
be
unlawful
if
practiced
in
any
other
industry.
it
is
that
last
avenue
of
relief
to
these
none
struck
carriers
that
the
petitioners
are
trying
to
close
it.
thank
you
your
honors.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
with
respect
to
the
facts
of
this
matter,
there
are
three
factual
questions
to
which
i
would
like
to
speak
a
little
further
than
counsel
for
the
petitioners
has.
those
three
questions
are,
first,
what
goes
on
in
the
terminal?
second,
what
was
the
conduct
of
the
petitioners?
third,
what
the
effect
of
that
conduct?
the
jacksonville
terminal,
its
name
rather
is
rather
a
misnomer.
the
jacksonville
terminal
is
not
simply
a
terminal,
a
place
where
train
movement
stop.
it
is
primarily
a
place
where
train
movements
go
through.
the
principle
main
line
of
the
atlantic
coastline
railroad
is
this
line
here,
this
blue
line
coming
down
going
through
the
terminal
properly
which
is
shown
in
green
and
exiting
here
into
the
south
being
shown
in
blue.
one
of
the
principle
main
lines
of
the
seaboard
railroad
is
this
line
coming
through
here
in
this
orange
line
coming
from
the
north
or
from
savannah
and
going
through
the
terminal
here
and
exiting
here
eventually
going
to
the
south.
the
terminal
stands
at
fort
the
main
lines
of
the
railroads
that
serve
the
state
of
florida.
if
you
cut
of
the
terminal
due
to
a
very
substantial
extent
cut
off
all
rail
service
to
and
from
peninsular
florida.
florida
is
a
peninsula,
there
is
basically
one
way
of
getting
into
it
by
land
from
the
north
and
accordingly
the
state
of
florida
is
highly
vulnerable
to
a
cutting
off
of
the
jacksonville
terminal.
we've
heard
a
great
deal
of
talk
about
the
work
done
for
the
fec
within
the
terminal.
to
put
into
perspective,
the
fec
uses
the
terminal
in
two
ways.
in
one
way,
its
freight
trains,
its
freight
cars
are
interchanged.
this
cars
are
brought
across
the
bridge
across
the
saint
john's
river,
so-called
the
cluster
bridge
up
from
the
fec
yard
which
are
down
about
another
12
miles
to
the
south
and
they
are
brought
here
by
their
crews
and
in
various
places
around
here
if
they
meet
the
carriers
to
whom
they
are
to
be
delivered
and
the
delivery
is
made,
similarly
in
the
pick
up,
the
cars
are
brought
into
the
terminal
or
elsewhere
around
the
perimeters
of
the
terminal
and
an
interchange
takes
place
and
the
cars
are
brought
back
down.
only
30%
of
the
interchange
movements
within
the
terminal
property
or
using
the
terminal
facilities
are
fec
connected.
so
in
one
side,
we
have
all
these
three
movements
which
are
for
the
account
of
the
none
struck
carriers,
the
seaboard,
the
coastline,
the
southern
terminal
company
itself,
none
of
which
has
any
labor
dispute
with
its
employees.
we
also
have
the
interchanges
which
do
involve
the
handling
of
the
cars
from
one
railroad
to
another,
only
30%
of
those
are
for
the
account
of
the
fec.
we
also
have
or
used
to
have
some
fec
passenger
train
activity
within
the
terminal.
the
other
carriers
run
42
trains
a
day,
passenger
trains
through
the
terminal,
the
none
struck
companies.
the
fec
run
two
cares,
two
passenger
trains
a
day
into
the
terminal
and
in
that
connection
they
receive
the
same
terminal
services,
the
selling
of
tickets,
the
washing
of
the
cars
that
the
other
none
struck
carriers
received.
these
passenger
movements
accounted
for
less
than
1%
of
the
total
passenger
cars
handled
through
the
terminal.
incidentally,
after
the
making
of
the
record
in
this
case
but
there
is
no
dispute
about
it,
the
fec
received
permission
to
suspend
all
passenger
service
and
so
according
to
them,
there
is
currently
no
use
whatsoever
of
the
terminal
by
the
fec's
passenger
trains.
now,
as
to
the
conduct
of
the
petitioners,
what
did
this
picketing
consist
of?
the
picketing
consisted
as
the
trial
court
found
of
the
placing
of
pickets
at
every
entrance
to
the
terminal,
every
entrance
by
rail,
by
road
or
on
foot.
the
trial
court's
finding
is
broad
enough
to
cover
the
entrance
of
denis
street
for
railways
there
where
only
main
line
movements
of
the
coastline
exit
and
enter.
it
is
undisputed
that
there
was
picketing
at
a.
corn
street
which
is
right
here
where
only
seaboard
mainline
movements
enter.
as
you
see,
we
need
to
distinguish
this,
a
copy
of
this
map
at
page
9
of
our
brief
of
the
seaboard's
terminal
movement
would
have
to
come
in
this
way
or
come
across
from
its
yards
and
come
in
this
way
of
this
line
cuts
right
across
the
terminal
and
its
used
by
the
mainline
trains
and
that
line
was
cut.
the
picket
signs
did
not
simply
say
please
don't
handle
fec
cars.
the
picket
signs
contained
two
exhortations
on
them.
the
first
exhortations
on
those
signs
was
do
not
cross
and
that
exhortation
was
lived
up
to.
the
railroad
men
honored
that
picket
sign,
they
did
not
cross
the
picket
line.
the
condition
and
it
was
stated
later
on
and
indeed
stated
in
papers
filed
in
this
court
by
counsel
was
that
the
solution
to
the
matter
was
the
placing
of
an
embargo
on
the
fec
by
the
other
carriers,
in
other
words,
a
refusal
to
handle
their
cars
but
the
appeal
that
the
pickets
made
to
the
employees
in
order
to
make
their
employers
hurt
enough
to
do
that
was
do
not
cross,
do
not
go
within
the
terminal.
the
effect
of
this
picketing
as
the
trial
court
found
on
very
ample
evidence
was
to
threaten
the
economic
strangulation
of
the
state
of
florida.
95%
of
the
u.s.
mail
passing
to
and
from
florida
comes
through
the
terminal.
if
the
terminal
were
shutdown
for
as
much
as
one
day,
it
would
six
days
to
catch
up
on
the
u.s.
mail.
a
very
substantial
portion
of
the
citrus
crop
and
of
the
other
basic
products
that
florida
exports,
the
phosphates
from
the
fields
in
florida
have
to
pass
through
the
terminal
if
they
are
going
to
move
by
rail
and
rail
is
one
of
their
primary
means
of
moving.
there
are
numerous
industries
that
have
settled
in
jacksonville
either
directly
adjacent
to
the
terminal
property
or
on
spurs
leading
off
from
the
terminal
property
where
cars
to
get
to
them
would
have
to
go
through
the
terminal
property
which
would
be
cut
off
from
all
rail
access
if
the
terminal
were
shutdown.
so
we
have
here
--
i
don't
purport
to
give
an
exhaustive
definition
of
secondary
picketing
but
i
think
if
anything
is
secondary
picketing,
the
conduct
here
was
secondary
picketing.
it
was
an
appeal
by
these
employees
of
the
fec
and
former
employees
of
the
fec,
two
other
carriers
employees
to
induce
them
to
stop
work
not
to
go
within
the
terminal
until
such
time
as
their
employers
saw
fit
to
stop
doing
business
with
the
fec.
now,
at
appropriate
time,
the
terminal
company
which
is
the
respondent
here
and
in
the
federal
case
the
other
none
struck
carriers
sued
both
in
the
federals
courts
and
after
a
finding
by
the
fifth
circuit
that
there
was
no
federal
court
jurisdiction
sued
in
the
state
court
for
an
injunction
against
this
conduct.
i
might
say
that
while
the
basis
if
remand
to
speak
to
the
question
that
mr.
justice
white
raised.
one
of
the
basis
on
which
the
remand
from
the
state
court,
from
the
federal
court
back
to
the
state
court
of
this
action
took
place
was
the
finding
of
he
fifth
circuit
that
there
was
no
federal
court
jurisdiction
in
that
the
norris-laguardia
act
precluded
federal
court
jurisdiction
and
that
was
one
of
the
basis
for
the
remand
by
judge
mcrae.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
i
suspect
not
your
honor
but
that
was
the
--
we
are
faced
also
with
the
fact
that
there
was
no
jurisdiction
in
the
federal
court
as
he
viewed
at
that
time
and
that
the
complaint
was
brought
solely
under
state
law
which
was
the
alternate
basis.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
the
judgment
was
the
judgment
of
the
fifth
circuit
to
the
effect
that
the
preliminary
injunction
out
of
the
federal
court
of
the
district
court
had
to
be
reversed
because
there
is
no
jurisdiction
in
the
federal
courts
by
reason
of
norris-laguardia.
that
was
the
fifth
circuit
judgment
which
was
a
judgment
in
favor
of
the
present
petitioners
which
was
affirmed.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
on
the
same
facts,
yes
your
honor.
so
it
has
been
held
that
there
is
no
jurisdiction
in
the
federal
courts
by
reason
of
norris-laguardia.
now,
whether
that
is
binding
very
purposes
in
this
present
case,
being
afforded
for
decision
is
a
matter.
this
case
comes
before
the
court
in
this
posture.
there
is
a
state
court
injunction
granted
under
state
law.
clearly
no
question
can
be
raised
with
respect
to
the
issues
of
state
law
in
this
court.
the
only
question
is
whether
there
are
some
basis
in
the
federal
law
either
in
the
federal
statutes
or
the
federal
constitution
that
precludes
the
state
courts
from
doing
what
they
did.
now,
the
petitioners
mentioned
five
or
six
basis,
i'll
try
and
take
them
up
in
order.
their
most
serious
basis
or
at
least
one
that
they
spend
the
most
time
on
is
that
by
reason
of
the
railway
labor
act
and
certain
other
statutes
regulating
railway
labor
relations,
they
refer
boiler
inspection
act
and
the
safety
appliance
act
which
don't
seem
to
have
much
to
do
with
the
case
but
by
reasons
of
this
federal
railway
labor
statutes,
there
is
a
supersession
of
state
law
and
of
state
court
jurisdiction
here
and
they
rely
for
analogy
on
this
court's
ruling
under
the
taft-hartley
act,
whereas,
we
know
in
a
long
line
of
case
after
the
passage
of
the
taft-hartley
and
after
particularly
the
addition
of
section
8
(b)
(4)
to
the
labor
management
relations
act
in
1947,
there
was
a
long
line
of
cases
in
this
court
holding
that
the
states
could
not
enjoin
conduct
which
was
either
arguably
prohibited
by
section
8
(b)
or
arguably
protected
by
section
7.
our
basic
contention
is
that
this
whole
line
of
argument
is
a
false
analogy.
there
is
simply
not
a
comparable
situation
here
between
the
taft-hartley
act
and
the
railway
labor
act.
under
the
taft-hartley
act,
you
have
a
detailed
code
of
the
sort
of
conduct
that
is
addressed
against
none
struck
employers
that
is
prohibited.
that
code
is
found
in
section
8
(b)
(4)
of
the
act,
a
very
lengthy,
a
very
involved
section.
it
is
also
found
in
section
8
(e)
of
the
act.
there
is
another
side
to
that
coin.
there
is
section
7
of
the
act
which
to
a
great
extent
says
that
conduct
which
is
not
prohibited
by
section
8
(b)
is
protected
under
section
7.
besides
that
very
detailed
substantive
code,
there
is
also
an
administrative
agency
which
is
charged
with
the
duty
of
adjudicating
matters
under
that
code
and
which
has
the
duty
of
drawing
the
dividing
line
in
the
place
where
congress
intended
it.
there
is
nothing
like
that
under
the
railway
labor
act.
there
is
no
regulation
whatsoever
--
no
regulation
whatsoever
under
the
railway
labor
act
of
the
sort
of
weapons
that
a
union
can
use
against
management
and
certainly
none
whatsoever
of
the
regulation
of
the
weapons
that
you
can
use
against
third
parties
to
labor
dispute.
and
while
there
are
certain
administrative
agencies
that
had
been
set
up
by
congress
under
the
railway
labor
act,
the
adjustment
board
and
the
mediation
board
and
the
ad
hoc
presidential
board
under
section
10,
there
is
no
administrative
agency
set
up
under
that
act
which
is
charged
with
the
duty
of
passing
on
whether
specific
union
weapons
or
specific
management
weapons
of
self-help
are
protected
or
prohibited.
this
is
an
area
in
which
congress
simply
has
not
moved.
and
our
contention
is
that
justice
in
the
case
that
was
decided
by
the
court
a
few
weeks
ago
involving
the
state
full
approval
of
this
that
there
is
room
for
concurrent
regulation
here
both
by
the
states
and
by
the
federal
government
in
an
area
where
the
federal
power
has
not
specifically
asserted
itself.
and
here,
the
federal
power
has
not
asserted
itself
by
regulating
the
sort
of
weapons
that
the
unions
can
use
and
particularly
the
sort
of
weapons
that
they
can
use
against
third
parties.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
there
is
no
general
law
against
picketing
in
the
state
of
florida
your
honor.
this
is
not
a
case
like
thornhill
were
they
simply
said
that
you
shall
not
picket.
the
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
i
don't
under
--
i
believe
that
there's
a
little
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
there
is
a
little
taft-hartley
act
or
there
is
a
state
labor
relations
act
in
florida
which
gives
workers
the
right
to
engage
in
concerted
activities.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
yes,
it
would
cover
that.
the
--
it
does
not
apply
directly
to
workers
in
the
railway
labor
field.
the
basis
of
the
injunction
here
was
the
state
common
law
against
secondary
boycotting.
this
was
not
--
the
injunction
was
not
passed
against
the
picketing
as
such,
it
was
passed
against
it
because
it
violated
state
substantive
law.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
no,
there
were
exemptions.
the
first
place
curiously
enough
the
petitioners
did
not
picket
at
the
main
rail
entrance
used
by
the
florida
east
coast
railroad.
the
picketing
is
permitted
at
the
reserve
gate
for
the
use
of
the
fec
employees.
there
has
been
a
reserve
gate
at
the
terminal
for
years
and
the
injunction
was
limited
and
did
not
cover
that
entrance
and
they
are
free
to
picket
there
at
which
post
free
to
picket
at
the
main
rail
entrance
and
of
course
free
to
picket
up
and
down
the
line
in
eastern
florida
where
the
fec
runs.
now,
my
argument
of
course
would
have
a
fallacy
in
it
if
we
could
deduce
a
basic
intention
by
congress
affirmatively
to
sanction
secondary
picketing
on
the
railroads.
in
other
words,
if
we
could
say
that
congress
wanted
to
protect
this
sort
of
conduct.
the
fact
that
it
hadn't
set
up
an
administrative
regime
which
was
designed
to
regulate
it
would
not
of
course
support
the
state
court
injunction.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
i
think
that's
an
issue,
i'm
not
sure
it's
a
disputative
issue.
i
think
--
i
feel
in
my
case
is
easier
if
it
was
and
i'm
sure
my
brother
feels
that
his
case
is
easier
if
it
was
not.
just
in
terms
of
the
--
i
suppose
the
fact
that
cases
like
the
caboni
case
back
in
the
1940's
seem
to
hold
that
states
have
a
very
definite
and
very
recognizable
interest
with
respect
to
preventing
the
extension
of
labor
disputes
to
persons
who
are
not
party
list
to
them
through
the
application
of
their
antitrust
laws
such
as
was
done
here
or
through
the
application
of
other
valid
state
statutes
and
i
think
that
does
affect
the
issues
though
i
would
not
say
that
it
was
disputative
of
them.
we
contend
that
there
is
absolutely
no
evidence
that
congress
ever
intended
affirmatively
to
sanction
the
use
of
the
secondary
boycott
on
the
railroad
industry.
the
petitioners
as
i
understand
it
point
to
approximately
four
statutes.
the
clayton
act,
first,
under
which
it
was
held
that
the
secondary
boycott
was
not
lawful.
the
norris-laguardia
act
which
in
its
terms
only
regulates
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts.
the
third
and
to
me
the
most
amazing
is
their
reference
to
the
legislative
history
of
the
taft-hartley
act
in
which
they
appear
to
contend
that
congress
declined
to
outlaw
the
secondary
boycott
on
the
railroads
because
they
thought
that
the
secondary
boycott
was
a
good
thing.
the
entire
colloquy
and
we
printed
starting
at
around
page
45
of
our
brief
and
it's
a
discussion
by
senator
taft.
he
begins
by
saying
in
this
bill
we
prohibit
secondary
boycotts
all
over
the
country
and
then
one
of
the
other
senators
raised
a
question
and
said,
“well,
what
about
the
railroads,
why
do
you
not
prohibit
the
secondary
boycott
on
the
railroads?”
and
the
discussion
quoted
is
that
railway
workers
are
not
that
engaging
in
such
practices
and
that
there
was
no
abuse
here
and
no
need
for
congress
to
alter
the
scheme
of
the
labor
act
in
relation
to
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
we
quote
that
on
our
brief
starting
at
page
45.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
that's
precisely
at
page
48,
he
said,
“we
saw
no
reason
to
change
that
situation”
mr.
senator
taft
speaking,
because
there
were
no
abuses
which
had
a
reason
in
connection
with
the
operation
of
the
railway
labor
act.
indeed,
this
is
really
a
unique
case.
there
is
really
no
trusting
for
a
situation
like
this
in
which
there
is
a
picketing
of
the
none
struck
carriers
on
an
interchange
point.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
thank
you
your
honor.
before
recess,
we
were
developing
the
point
that
congress
never
affirmatively
sanctioned
the
use
of
secondary
conduct
against
none
struck
carriers
by
rail
unions.
and
we
discussed
the
history
of
the
taft-hartley
act.
the
paradox
in
what
the
petitioners
are
contending
for
if
congress
through
some
process
of
silence
or
some
process
of
silent
approval
of
this
form
of
extended
self-help
against
third
parties
made
this
conduct
lawful
in
this
context,
we
would
have
the
paradoxical
situation
in
which
it
would
be
unlawful
to
engage
in
this
conduct
in
an
industry
regulated
under
the
taft-hartley
act,
a
toy
factory,
a
candy
factory,
any
factory
producing
goods
for
interstate
commerce
in
the
jurisdictional
minimum
but
it
would
not
be
unlawful
to
practice
this
conduct
against
a
railroad,
against
an
instrumentality
of
interstate
commerce
against
one
of
the
more
vital
and
basic
of
american
industries.
i
think
really
the
point
needs
no
further
development.
there
is
no
evidence
whatsoever
that
congress
ever
put
its
stamp
of
approval
on
this
conduct.
congress
happened
not
to
regulate
this
conduct.
it
happened
not
to
provide
an
administrative
agency
for
its
regulation
but
that
does
not
mean
under
these
circumstances
that
it
meant
to
leave
it
completely
unregulated.
now,
there
are
three
further
basis
of
contention
that
that
petitioners
make.
they
contend
first
that
the
norris-laguardia
act,
second,
that
the
taft-hartley
act
and
third,
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
preclude
the
injunction
that
was
granted
here
by
the
state
courts.
i
will
give
our
responses
to
those
briefly
because
we
frankly
submit
that
this
are
make
weight
contentions.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
yes,
this
is
an
additional
basis
on
which
it
doesn't
control
the
other
statutes
that
the
petitioners
bring
in
with
on
somewhat
basis.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
well,
you
would.
the
--
well,
their
basis,
the
various
basis
that
we're
submitting
that
we
have
submitted
or
negations
of
the
applicability
of
federal
law
in
any
basis.
we
contend
that
it
doesn't
apply
because
of
the
railway
labor
act
and
it
doesn't
apply
because
of
the
taft-hartley
act.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
i
wouldn't
so
submit
your
honor
because
the
--
that
would
then
for
one
thing
throw
open
this
questions,
these
additional
questions.
first,
whether
the
norris-laguardia
act
would
have
to
be
applied
by
the
state
court
in
applying
the
federal
court.
second,
whether
the
norris-laguardia
act
prohibits
this
injunction
and
the
only
holding
on
this
is
the
four
to
four
decisions
by
this
court
which
of
course
is
not
a
binding
precedent.
on
that
we'd
submit
everything
that
we
said
before
and
that
would
--
those
would
be
our
submissions
even
if
the
federal
law
did
apply,
i
don't
think
it
necessarily
means
that
the
state
court
judgment
will
have
a
third
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
yes,
and
that
could
very
well
be
as
we
contended
in
the
other
case
where
we
sought
an
injunction
under
the
railway
labor
act
and
the
interstate
commerce
act
that
those
statutes
which
are
aimed
at
minimizing
the
conflict
on
the
railroads
and
trying
to
confine
industrial
disputes.
certainly
never
contemplated
that
there'd
be
any
secondary
boycott
against
a
none
struck
carrier,
just
to
person
who
never
had
advantage
of
the
processes
of
the
railway
labor
act
and
we
would
also
contend
for
the
reasons
that
we
contended
before
that
the
norris-laguardia
act
would
not
apply
even
if
this
case
were
govern
by
federal
law.
if
it's
governed
by
state
law
under
state
court,
we
submit
there
is
no
basis
whatsoever
for
saying
that
it
applies.
there
is
a
somewhat
different
argument
that
the
petitioners
make.
it
develops
that
the
petitioners
that
the
union
basically
did
the
picketing,
the
brotherhood
of
railroad
trainmen,
it
also
represents
bus
drivers.
7%
of
its
membership
are
bus
drivers
and
the
bus
drivers
of
course
had
nothing
to
do
with
this
dispute
and
they
are
not
in
the
lodges,
they
were
involved
in
this
picketing
but
the
petitioners
contend
that
it
is
therefore
arguable
that
the
national
labor
relations
board
has
jurisdiction.
now,
they
further
contend
that
it
does
not
have
jurisdiction
that
is
our
contention
too.
nobody
contends
that
the
national
labor
relations
board
has
jurisdiction
in
this
case.
but
they
submit
that
because
7%
of
their
membership
all
fund
these
other
lodges
or
bus
drivers
are
not
under
the
railway
labor
act
that
therefore
as
i
understand
it
in
every
case
involving
this
large
union
that
there
is
an
arguable
applicability
of
the
taft-hartley
act
and
that
accordingly,
the
state
courts
would
have
to
state
their
hand
and
i
will
assume
also
that
the
agency
is
set
up
under
the
railway
labor
act,
the
mediation
board
and
the
adjustment
board
would
be
in
the
same
posture.
we
think
that
to
state
that
sort
of
contention
is
really
to
answer
it
that
the
courts
have
generally
looked
to
the
particular
aspect
of
the
union
and
the
particular
aspect
of
the
work
that's
involved.
this
is
a
dispute
wholly
within
the
railroad
union,
railroad
industry.
the
brotherhoods
are
predominantly
railroad
brotherhoods.
they
are
predominantly
--
their
lodges
were
entirely
railroad
workers
and
the
employers
are
all
common
carriers,
we
submit
there
is
no
basis
arguable
or
otherwise
for
the
applicability
of
taft-hartley.
on
the
first
amendment
applicability,
our
contention
is
that
this
is
not
a
state
law
against
picketing,
this
is
a
state
law
against
specific
abuses
and
the
injunction
was
so
limited.
i
think
i
--
i
just
well
just
to
take
a
moment
to
see
what
it
is
that
the
petitioners
are
contending
for
in
this
case
before
this
court
this
morning.
if
they
prevail
this
morning,
they
will
have
established
that
there
is
no
agency
of
government
federal,
state
or
local,
traditional
or
administrative
that
can
regulate
their
conduct
then
applying
this
measure,
these
economic
warfare
measures
to
this
none
struck
carriers.
let
me
recap,
it
is
common
ground
i
believe
that
none
of
the
agencies
set
up
under
the
railway
labor
act
have
jurisdiction.
this
is
not
a
case
for
the
adjustment
board
or
for
the
mediation
board.
both
parties
agreed
that
the
labor
board
has
no
jurisdiction.
this
court
in
its
four
to
four
decision
