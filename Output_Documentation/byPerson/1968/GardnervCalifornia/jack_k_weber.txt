mr.
jack
k.
weber
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
to
court.
permit
me
to
begin
by
attempting
to
distinguish
long
versus
district
court
of
iowa
and
to
explain
something
of
our
california
procedures
in
the
process
of
doing
that.
the
obvious
distinction
between
long
and
the
situation
here
is
that
california
does
have
habeas
corpus
and
iowa
had
an
appeal
procedure.
however
permit
me
to
emphasize
the
significance
of
that
difference.
when
you
have
an
appeal
although
it
is
possible
to
hear
the
matter
on
a
clerk's
transcript,
in
the
ordinary
case,
the
focus
is
on
the
trial
court
below,
the
proceedings
there,
and
the
reporter's
transcript
of
those
proceeding
and
--
mr.
jack
k.
weber
that's
right,
yes
sir.
and
the
focus
of
the
court
is
to
review
the
proceedings
below
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
was
error
and
in
order
to
do
that
you
look
at
the
transcript.
however
in
california
we
have
an
entirely
different
procedure
where
the
proceedings
below
are
entirely
tangential
and
collateral.
there
the
court
doesn't
necessarily
review
the
proceeding
below,
it
receives
allegations
from
the
petitioner
and
it
tests
those
allegations
to
determine
their
sufficiency
and
because
of
that,
because
the
court
relies
on
allegations
it
does
not
necessarily
need
a
transcript
to
resolve
the
issues.
there
is
another
aspect
of
this
difference
also.
the
habeas
corpus
procedure
has
multiple
stages,
the
first
stage
is
a
pleading
stage,
after
that
the
court
gets
into
the
process
of
determining
the
truth
of
the
allegations
that
it
has
not
denied
the
petition.
thus
in
this
initial
stage,
the
court
does
not
require
proof,
it
does
not
require
evidence,
it
does
not
require
a
procedure
for
submitting
the
matter
in
any
particular
way.
it
can
proceed
to
determine
the
sufficiency
of
the
allegations
just
by
reading
the
allegations
and
this
is
the
normal,
the
meaningful
and
the
usual
way
to
proceed
in
habeas
corpus
matters.
mr.
jack
k.
weber
that's
correct
your
honor
yes.
well,
of
course
there
are
differences
between
judges
as
to
interpretation.
mr.
jack
k.
weber
well,
i
wouldn't
go
so
far
as
to
say
it's
not
reviewable
there
are
rare
cases
in
which
the
appellate
court
has
determined
that
there
was
some
error
in
a
collateral
attack
proceeding
in
the
court
below
but
the
usual
practice
is
to
treat
the
whole
matter
a
new
and
it's
a
de
novo
proceeding
and
i
guess
namely
it's
just
--
mr.
jack
k.
weber
that's
the
way
it's
done,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
he
isn't
bound
by
the
substantial
evidence
rule
or
any
of
the
other
customary
rules
relating
to
appeal.
he
isn't
bound
by
the
record
below
or
anything
else.
second
time
around,
he
can
find
some
new
ways
to
present
the
matter
to
the
court,
though
a
new
and
better
allegations.
mr.
jack
k.
weber
well
of
course
when
it
proceeds
by
allegations
it
doesn't
need
to
find
error
in
the
court
below,
they
just
test
the
sufficiency
of
the
allegations
and
determine
the
original
substantive
claim
anew.
however
if
the
petitioner
alleges
there
was
some
error
below,
the
court
if
it
desires
to
do
so
can
get
into
the
business
of
evaluating
what
happened
below
and
order
a
transcript
of
what
occurred
there.
mr.
jack
k.
weber
well,
now
we're
getting
into
the
second
stage
of
the
habeas
corpus
procedure
which
relates
to
proof,
he
would
go
to
the
appellate
court,
he
would
set
out
his
allegations
about
what
went
wrong
in
the
court
below
and
if
the
court
deemed
those
allegations
sufficient,
then
it
would
get
into
a
question
of
getting
the
transcripts
and
establishing
the
truth
of
those
claims.
mr.
jack
k.
weber
it
denies
the
petition.
this
is
the
standard
--
mr.
jack
k.
weber
well,
it
holds
an
independent
hearing.
if
it
finds
that
the
allegations
are
sufficient
and
that
they
require
an
evidentiary
test,
it
doesn't
always
go
straight
to
a
hearing
you
understand,
the
usual
procedure
of
the
court
is
to
appoint
counsel
for
the
petitioner
and
to
coax
the
parties
into
entering
into
stipulations
and
to
test
out
whether
there's
any
real
evidential
differences
between
them
because
hearings
are
an
expensive
cumbersome
process.
mr.
jack
k.
weber
it's
a
referee,
i
think
i've
cited
the
riddle
case
in
my
brief
where
the
court
describes
this
procedure
and
then
a
transcript
is
prepared
and
the
court
receives
the
report
of
the
referee
and
then
it
re-determines
and
reweighs
the
referees'
findings,
giving
them
great
weight
but
not
being
bound
by
that.
mr.
jack
k.
weber
yes,
sir.
mr.
jack
k.
weber
yes.
mr.
jack
k.
weber
if
the
request
that,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
k.
weber
it
depends
on
the
nature
of
the
allegations.
if
the
nature
of
the
allegations
are
such
that
a
transcript
would
be
necessary
to
answer
them,
we'd
quite
often
will
secure
a
transcript
and
supply
it
to
the
court
at
that
point.
mr.
jack
k.
weber
that's
one
of
those
allegations.
mr.
jack
k.
weber
well,
if
he
has
the,
of
course
if
he
has
the
â€“
of
course
he
doesn't
have
the
means,
he
can't
buy
the
transcript,
he'd
have
to
make
some
request
to
the
court
to
secure
it.
mr.
jack
k.
weber
well,
we
still
have
a
few
dollars,
and
yes.
mr.
jack
k.
weber
well,
there's
always
a
process
of
testing
out
these
claims
and
when
then
the
court
requests
a
response,
the
state
could
secure
a
transcript.
but
the
petitioner
has
to
get
his
transcripts
in
effect
at
the
sufferance
of
the
court
if
he's
an
indigent.
he
has
to
ask
the
court
for
it
and
he
has
to
establish
his
need
for
it
to
the
court.
it
just
isn't
practical
we
feel
to
let
in
the
judge
--
mr.
jack
k.
weber
well,
i
usually
feel
that
the
situation
is
turned
around
and
that
the
petitioners
are
the
ones
who
are
putting
us
on
the
spot
through
their
allegation.
but
it
does
exist
this
difference,
the
state
does
have
the
power
to
order
a
transcript,
the
indigent
has
to
secure
his
transcript
at
the
determination
of
the
court
and
this
procedure
i
guess
comes
about
because
of
the
possibilities
of
economic
waste
involved.
if
the
indigent
could
just
secure
every
transcript
that
he
desired
at
his
own
determination,
there's
concern
that
many
of
the
prisoners
would
abuse
that
sort
of
privilege.
mr.
jack
k.
weber
well,
as
this
court
has
pointed
out
there's
a
difference
between
direct
appeals
and
--
mr.
jack
k.
weber
we
do
furnish
free
transcripts
on
the
direct
appeal.
mr.
jack
k.
weber
automatically,
yes.
mr.
jack
k.
weber
whether
they
have
money
or
not,
yes
your
honor,
california
is
very
liberal
in
doing
that.
mr.
jack
k.
weber
well,
the
court
customarily
receives
any
documents
that
petitioners
send
it
and
they
will
make
use
of
those
documents,
yes.
mr.
jack
k.
weber
well,
we
don't
deny
that
there's
some
difference
between
the
way
that
indigents
are
treated
here
and
between
the
powers
of
the
state
to
secure
a
transcript.
the
problem
is
one
of
determining
whether
that
difference
or
discrimination
is
invidious.
mr.
jack
k.
weber
the
justification
for
requiring
him
--?
mr.
jack
k.
weber
well,
the
justification
would
be
in
the
economic
cost
in
furnishing
the
transcripts
without
some
test
or
need.
mr.
jack
k.
weber
yeah.
mr.
jack
k.
weber
well,
i
think
that
perhaps
the
best
answer
to
your
honor's
question
is
that
the
indigent
has
an
effective
procedure
apart
from
having
the
transcript,
he
can
describe
it
all
to
the
court
in
his
allegations
if
he
feels
he
wants
to
do
so.
mr.
jack
k.
weber
well,
he
did
file
a
petition
in
the
superior
court
which
gained
him
the
hearing,
we
feel
that
that's
an
adequate
test
to
demonstrate
that
he
would
be
able
to
do
the
same
thing
in
the
appellate
court.
mr.
jack
k.
weber
well,
because
we
need
some
test
to
curb
waste
in
these
areas
and
some
test
--
mr.
jack
k.
weber
waste
in
these
areas
because
if
we
gave
all
of
these
transcripts
out
whether
the
indigent
needed
them
or
not,
it
could
cause
a
wasteful
system.
mr.
jack
k.
weber
well,
of
course
if
human
resources
were
unlimited
and
funds
were
unlimited,
we
would
be
able
to
provide
indigent
prisoners
with
all
that
they
wanted
in
the
way
of
transcripts
in
many
other
problem
areas
too.
mr.
jack
k.
weber
i
would
say
that
it's
a
fairly
common
practice,
one
can
pickup
almost
any
volume
of
the
california
supreme
court
reports
and
it
will
have
two
or
three
such
hearings
reported
in
it.
mr.
jack
k.
weber
i
made
a
very
quick
canvas
of
laws
of
the
other
states
and
there
are
a
few,
i
think
there's
about
five
or
so
that
still
retain
the
common
law
procedure,
many
of
the
others
have
adopted
by
statute
an
appeal
procedure,
some
others
have
converted
writ
review
procedures
into
something
that
is
virtually
or
equivalent
to
an
appeal.
i
think
north
dakota
has
something
that
they
call
a
power
of
superintending
control
which
is
in
effect
a
kind
of
appeal
procedure.
mr.
jack
k.
weber
it's
very
true
your
honor,
the
california
--
mr.
jack
k.
weber
california
has
directly
expanded
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
to
protect
the
rights
of
the
prisoners.
mr.
jack
k.
weber
well,
we
feel
that
the
right
to
transcript
is
adequate
at
the
present
time
in
order
to
fully
protect
the
real
rights
of
the
prisoners,
well
at
the
same
time
providing
some
kind
of
a
screening
procedure
to
take
off
waste
and
needless
requests
and
so
on.
mr.
jack
k.
weber
yes
he
could
if
he
desired
to
do
so,
write
out
his
own
bill
of
--
mr.
jack
k.
weber
the
issue
in
order
to
show
cause
usually--
mr.
jack
k.
weber
appoint
counsel
for
petitioner
and
then
the
state
will
file
its
return
to
it
and
answer
the--
mr.
jack
k.
weber
i
don't
recall
any
cases
off
hand
where
they
have
called
for
the
transcript.
mr.
jack
k.
weber
that's
generally
speaking
true
although
it's
possible
that
one
of
the
parties
will
supply
a
transcript
of
what
occurred
to
the
court,
so
that
it
can
use
that
in
making
determinations
of
the
fact.
mr.
jack
k.
weber
well,
i
don't
know
of
any
cases
in
which
the
california
supreme
court
has
dealt
with
that
particular
problem
overtly.
i
suppose
that
if
it
was
a
certified
transcript
by
a
reporter
there
wouldn't
normally
be
any
issue
as
to
its
validity,
it
doesn't
--
it's
not
something
that
arises
too
often.
mr.
jack
k.
weber
i
think
that
the
likelihood
of
a
hearing
in
the
state
supreme
court
would
depend
on
the
substantive
claims
more
than
anything
else.
it
would
depend
whether
he
has
sufficiently
stated
that
he
has
been
deprived
certain
constitutional
rights.
mr.
jack
k.
weber
in
most
cases,
i
think
it
would
not.
there
is
some
possibility
that
you
could
find
something
in
there
that
might
interest
or
intrigue
the
supreme
court,
but
i
think
that
possibility
is
sufficiently
remote
and
speculative
that
it
would
be
out
waived
--
mr.
jack
k.
weber
well,
there
if
the
allegation
was
sufficient
they
would
call
for
a
rule
to
show
cause
and
the
state
well,
i
suppose
it
responds,
he
did
have
counsel
and
you
would
say
i
suppose
you
would
say
--
mr.
jack
k.
weber
well,
you
could
just
get
the
records
from
superior
court
filed
from
the
original
trial.
mr.
jack
k.
weber
well,
if
the
court
would
normally
rely
on
the
superior
court's
records
unless
they
are
disputed
by
the
petitioner
in
some
way,
i
suppose
that
if
he
says
that
the
records
are
a
lie
that
some
sort
of
a
hearing
would
be
necessary
to
determine
the
accuracy
of
the
records.
mr.
jack
k.
weber
i've
never
known
the
supreme
court
to
expressly
deny
a
hearing
based
on
a
hearing
in
the
superior
court.
of
course,
i
don't
know
of
any
cases
in
which
they've
discussed
the
points
at
all.
so
that
it
is
largely
a
matter
of
trying
to
guess
what
goes
in
the
minds
of
the
justices
there.
mr.
jack
k.
weber
in
this
particular
case?
mr.
jack
k.
weber
well,
this
is
an
unusual
situation,
because
between
the
time
that
the
petition
was
presented
in
the
superior
court
and
the
time
that
the
supreme
court
received
the
substantive
allegations,
it
came
down
with
a
major
pronouncement
in
this
area
affecting
inmate
rights
and
that
determination
was
against
the
petitioner,
so
that
the
legal
situation
had
changed
considerably
and
i
think
that
the
state
supreme
court
could
have
utilized
its
very
recent
decisions
to
deny
the
petition
without
a
hearing
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
jack
k.
weber
that's
correct
yes
your
honor.
mr.
jack
k.
weber
although
of
course
we
do
dispute
â€“
mr.
jack
k.
weber
we
do
dispute
the
truth
â€“
mr.
jack
k.
weber
we
do
dispute
the
truth
of
the
allegations
in
the
petition.
mr.
jack
k.
weber
well
--
mr.
jack
k.
weber
of
course
if
the
writ
is
granted
in
superior
court
the
state
would
have
a
right
of
appeal.
so
that
would
be
one
situation
where
a
transcript
would
be
necessary.
mr.
jack
k.
weber
well,
some
of
these
procedures
help
the
state
occasionally,
again
the
transcript
could
be
used
by
one
party
or
the
other
on
the--
mr.
jack
k.
weber
no,
i
don't
think.
mr.
jack
k.
weber
i
wouldn't
agree
with
that.
i
noticed
that
the
federal
courts
have
a
power
to
order
the
transcript
made
up
from
the
reporter's
notes
also,
so
that
it
does
bear
on
the
federal
determination
as
well
as
the
state
determination.
mr.
jack
k.
weber
excuse
me.
mr.
jack
k.
weber
yes,
but
the
federal
courts
have
a
power
in
determining
state
habeas
corpus
petitions
to
order
the
transcript
of
this
particular
evidentiary
hearing.
so
that
would
be
a
situation
in
which
the
petitioner
would
benefit
from
the
preparation
of
a
transcript.
mr.
jack
k.
weber
well
we
have
forms
provided
for
the
petitioners
and
they
--
mr.
jack
k.
weber
no,
your
honor
i
think
it
goes
a
little
beyond
that
and
that
our
procedures
are
adequate
to
give
meaningful
habeas
corpus
to
indigent
prisoners
as
well
as
those
who
have
some
funds.
if
there
are
no
further
questions
i
will
submit.
mr.
jack
k.
weber
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
to
court.
permit
me
to
begin
by
attempting
to
distinguish
long
versus
district
court
of
iowa
and
to
explain
something
of
our
california
procedures
in
the
process
of
doing
that.
the
obvious
distinction
between
long
and
the
situation
here
is
that
california
does
have
habeas
corpus
and
iowa
had
an
appeal
procedure.
however
permit
me
to
emphasize
the
significance
of
that
difference.
when
you
have
an
appeal
although
it
is
possible
to
hear
the
matter
on
a
clerk's
transcript,
in
the
ordinary
case,
the
focus
is
on
the
trial
court
below,
the
proceedings
there,
and
the
reporter's
transcript
of
those
proceeding
and
--
mr.
jack
k.
weber
that's
right,
yes
sir.
and
the
focus
of
the
court
is
to
review
the
proceedings
below
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
was
error
and
in
order
to
do
that
you
look
at
the
transcript.
however
in
california
we
have
an
entirely
different
procedure
where
the
proceedings
below
are
entirely
tangential
and
collateral.
there
the
court
doesn't
necessarily
review
the
proceeding
below,
it
receives
allegations
from
the
petitioner
and
it
tests
those
allegations
to
determine
their
sufficiency
and
because
of
that,
because
the
court
relies
on
allegations
it
does
not
necessarily
need
a
transcript
to
resolve
the
issues.
there
is
another
aspect
of
this
difference
also.
the
habeas
corpus
procedure
has
multiple
stages,
the
first
stage
is
a
pleading
stage,
after
that
the
court
gets
into
the
process
of
determining
the
truth
of
the
allegations
that
it
has
not
denied
the
petition.
thus
in
this
initial
stage,
the
court
does
not
require
proof,
it
does
not
require
evidence,
it
does
not
require
a
procedure
for
submitting
the
matter
in
any
particular
way.
it
can
proceed
to
determine
the
sufficiency
of
the
allegations
just
by
reading
the
allegations
and
this
is
the
normal,
the
meaningful
and
the
usual
way
to
proceed
in
habeas
corpus
matters.
mr.
jack
k.
weber
that's
correct
your
honor
yes.
well,
of
course
there
are
differences
between
judges
as
to
interpretation.
mr.
jack
k.
weber
well,
i
wouldn't
go
so
far
as
to
say
it's
not
reviewable
there
are
rare
cases
in
which
the
appellate
court
has
determined
that
there
was
some
error
in
a
collateral
attack
proceeding
in
the
court
below
but
the
usual
practice
is
to
treat
the
whole
matter
a
new
and
it's
a
de
novo
proceeding
and
i
guess
namely
it's
just
--
mr.
jack
k.
weber
that's
the
way
it's
done,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
he
isn't
bound
by
the
substantial
evidence
rule
or
any
of
the
other
customary
rules
relating
to
appeal.
he
isn't
bound
by
the
record
below
or
anything
else.
second
time
around,
he
can
find
some
new
ways
to
present
the
matter
to
the
court,
though
a
new
and
better
allegations.
mr.
jack
k.
weber
well
of
course
when
it
proceeds
by
allegations
it
doesn't
need
to
find
error
in
the
court
below,
they
just
test
the
sufficiency
of
the
allegations
and
determine
the
original
substantive
claim
anew.
however
if
the
petitioner
alleges
there
was
some
error
below,
the
court
if
it
desires
to
do
so
can
get
into
the
business
of
evaluating
what
happened
below
and
order
a
transcript
of
what
occurred
there.
mr.
jack
k.
weber
well,
now
we're
getting
into
the
second
stage
of
the
habeas
corpus
procedure
which
relates
to
proof,
he
would
go
to
the
appellate
court,
he
would
set
out
his
allegations
about
what
went
wrong
in
the
court
below
and
if
the
court
deemed
those
allegations
sufficient,
then
it
would
get
into
a
question
of
getting
the
transcripts
and
establishing
the
truth
of
those
claims.
mr.
jack
k.
weber
it
denies
the
petition.
this
is
the
standard
--
mr.
jack
k.
weber
well,
it
holds
an
independent
hearing.
if
it
finds
that
the
allegations
are
sufficient
and
that
they
require
an
evidentiary
test,
it
doesn't
always
go
straight
to
a
hearing
you
understand,
the
usual
procedure
of
the
court
is
to
appoint
counsel
for
the
petitioner
and
to
coax
the
parties
into
entering
into
stipulations
and
to
test
out
whether
there's
any
real
evidential
differences
between
them
because
hearings
are
an
expensive
cumbersome
process.
mr.
jack
k.
weber
it's
a
referee,
i
think
i've
cited
the
riddle
case
in
my
brief
where
the
court
describes
this
procedure
and
then
a
transcript
is
prepared
and
the
court
receives
the
report
of
the
referee
and
then
it
re-determines
and
reweighs
the
referees'
findings,
giving
them
great
weight
but
not
being
bound
by
that.
mr.
jack
k.
weber
yes,
sir.
mr.
jack
k.
weber
yes.
mr.
jack
k.
weber
if
the
request
that,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
k.
weber
it
depends
on
the
nature
of
the
allegations.
if
the
nature
of
the
allegations
are
such
that
a
transcript
would
be
necessary
to
answer
them,
we'd
quite
often
will
secure
a
transcript
and
supply
it
to
the
court
at
that
point.
mr.
jack
k.
weber
that's
one
of
those
allegations.
mr.
jack
k.
weber
well,
if
he
has
the,
of
course
if
he
has
the
â€“
of
course
he
doesn't
have
the
means,
he
can't
buy
the
transcript,
he'd
have
to
make
some
request
to
the
court
to
secure
it.
mr.
jack
k.
weber
well,
we
still
have
a
few
dollars,
and
yes.
mr.
jack
k.
weber
well,
there's
always
a
process
of
testing
out
these
claims
and
when
then
the
court
requests
a
response,
the
state
could
secure
a
transcript.
but
the
petitioner
has
to
get
his
transcripts
in
effect
at
the
sufferance
of
the
court
if
he's
an
indigent.
he
has
to
ask
the
court
for
it
and
he
has
to
establish
his
need
for
it
to
the
court.
it
just
isn't
practical
we
feel
to
let
in
the
judge
--
mr.
jack
k.
weber
well,
i
usually
feel
that
the
situation
is
turned
around
and
that
the
petitioners
are
the
ones
who
are
putting
us
on
the
spot
through
their
allegation.
but
it
does
exist
this
difference,
the
state
does
have
the
power
to
order
a
transcript,
the
indigent
has
to
secure
his
transcript
at
the
determination
of
the
court
and
this
procedure
i
guess
comes
about
because
of
the
possibilities
of
economic
waste
involved.
if
the
indigent
could
just
secure
every
transcript
that
he
desired
at
his
own
determination,
there's
concern
that
many
of
the
prisoners
would
abuse
that
sort
of
privilege.
mr.
jack
k.
weber
well,
as
this
court
has
pointed
out
there's
a
difference
between
direct
appeals
and
--
mr.
jack
k.
weber
we
do
furnish
free
transcripts
on
the
direct
appeal.
mr.
jack
k.
weber
automatically,
yes.
mr.
jack
k.
weber
whether
they
have
money
or
not,
yes
your
honor,
california
is
very
liberal
in
doing
that.
mr.
jack
k.
weber
well,
the
court
customarily
receives
any
documents
that
petitioners
send
it
and
they
will
make
use
of
those
documents,
yes.
mr.
jack
k.
weber
well,
we
don't
deny
that
there's
some
difference
between
the
way
that
indigents
are
treated
here
and
between
the
powers
of
the
state
to
secure
a
transcript.
the
problem
is
one
of
determining
whether
that
difference
or
discrimination
is
invidious.
mr.
jack
k.
weber
the
justification
for
requiring
him
--?
mr.
jack
k.
weber
well,
the
justification
would
be
in
the
economic
cost
in
furnishing
the
transcripts
without
some
test
or
need.
mr.
jack
k.
weber
yeah.
mr.
jack
k.
weber
well,
i
think
that
perhaps
the
best
answer
to
your
honor's
question
is
that
the
indigent
has
an
effective
procedure
apart
from
having
the
transcript,
he
can
describe
it
all
to
the
court
in
his
allegations
if
he
feels
he
wants
to
do
so.
mr.
jack
k.
weber
well,
he
did
file
a
petition
in
the
superior
court
which
gained
him
the
hearing,
we
feel
that
that's
an
adequate
test
to
demonstrate
that
he
would
be
able
to
do
the
same
thing
in
the
appellate
court.
mr.
jack
k.
weber
well,
because
we
need
some
test
to
curb
waste
in
these
areas
and
some
test
--
mr.
jack
k.
weber
waste
in
these
areas
because
if
we
gave
all
of
these
transcripts
out
whether
the
indigent
needed
them
or
not,
it
could
cause
a
wasteful
system.
mr.
jack
k.
weber
well,
of
course
if
human
resources
were
unlimited
and
funds
were
unlimited,
we
would
be
able
to
provide
indigent
prisoners
with
all
that
they
wanted
in
the
way
of
transcripts
in
many
other
problem
areas
too.
mr.
jack
k.
weber
i
would
say
that
it's
a
fairly
common
practice,
one
can
pickup
almost
any
volume
of
the
california
supreme
court
reports
and
it
will
have
two
or
three
such
hearings
reported
in
it.
mr.
jack
k.
weber
i
made
a
very
quick
canvas
of
laws
of
the
other
states
and
there
are
a
few,
i
think
there's
about
five
or
so
that
still
retain
the
common
law
procedure,
many
of
the
others
have
adopted
by
statute
an
appeal
procedure,
some
others
have
converted
writ
review
procedures
into
something
that
is
virtually
or
equivalent
to
an
appeal.
i
think
north
dakota
has
something
that
they
call
a
power
of
superintending
control
which
is
in
effect
a
kind
of
appeal
procedure.
mr.
jack
k.
weber
it's
very
true
your
honor,
the
california
--
mr.
jack
k.
weber
california
has
directly
expanded
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
to
protect
the
rights
of
the
prisoners.
mr.
jack
k.
weber
well,
we
feel
that
the
right
to
transcript
is
adequate
at
the
present
time
in
order
to
fully
protect
the
real
rights
of
the
prisoners,
well
at
the
same
time
providing
some
kind
of
a
screening
procedure
to
take
off
waste
and
needless
requests
and
so
on.
mr.
jack
k.
weber
yes
he
could
if
he
desired
to
do
so,
write
out
his
own
bill
of
--
mr.
jack
k.
weber
the
issue
in
order
to
show
cause
usually--
mr.
jack
k.
weber
appoint
counsel
for
petitioner
and
then
the
state
will
file
its
return
to
it
and
answer
the--
mr.
jack
k.
weber
i
don't
recall
any
cases
off
hand
where
they
have
called
for
the
transcript.
mr.
jack
k.
weber
that's
generally
speaking
true
although
it's
possible
that
one
of
the
parties
will
supply
a
transcript
of
what
occurred
to
the
court,
so
that
it
can
use
that
in
making
determinations
of
the
fact.
mr.
jack
k.
weber
well,
i
don't
know
of
any
cases
in
which
the
california
supreme
court
has
dealt
with
that
particular
problem
overtly.
i
suppose
that
if
it
was
a
certified
transcript
by
a
reporter
there
wouldn't
normally
be
any
issue
as
to
its
validity,
it
doesn't
--
it's
not
something
that
arises
too
often.
mr.
jack
k.
weber
i
think
that
the
likelihood
of
a
hearing
in
the
state
supreme
court
would
depend
on
the
substantive
claims
more
than
anything
else.
it
would
depend
whether
he
has
sufficiently
stated
that
he
has
been
deprived
certain
constitutional
rights.
mr.
jack
k.
weber
in
most
cases,
i
think
it
would
not.
there
is
some
possibility
that
you
could
find
something
in
there
that
might
interest
or
intrigue
the
supreme
court,
but
i
think
that
possibility
is
sufficiently
remote
and
speculative
that
it
would
be
out
waived
--
mr.
jack
k.
weber
well,
there
if
the
allegation
was
sufficient
they
would
call
for
a
rule
to
show
cause
and
the
state
well,
i
suppose
it
responds,
he
did
have
counsel
and
you
would
say
i
suppose
you
would
say
--
mr.
jack
k.
weber
well,
you
could
just
get
the
records
from
superior
court
filed
from
the
original
trial.
mr.
jack
k.
weber
well,
if
the
court
would
normally
rely
on
the
superior
court's
records
unless
they
are
disputed
by
the
petitioner
in
some
way,
i
suppose
that
if
he
says
that
the
records
are
a
lie
that
some
sort
of
a
hearing
would
be
necessary
to
determine
the
accuracy
of
the
records.
mr.
jack
k.
weber
i've
never
known
the
supreme
court
to
expressly
deny
a
hearing
based
on
a
hearing
in
the
superior
court.
of
course,
i
don't
know
of
any
cases
in
which
they've
discussed
the
points
at
all.
so
that
it
is
largely
a
matter
of
trying
to
guess
what
goes
in
the
minds
of
the
justices
there.
mr.
jack
k.
weber
in
this
particular
case?
mr.
jack
k.
weber
well,
this
is
an
unusual
situation,
because
between
the
time
that
the
petition
was
presented
in
the
superior
court
and
the
time
that
the
supreme
court
received
the
substantive
allegations,
it
came
down
with
a
major
pronouncement
in
this
area
affecting
inmate
rights
and
that
determination
was
against
the
petitioner,
so
that
the
legal
situation
had
changed
considerably
and
i
think
that
the
state
supreme
court
could
have
utilized
its
very
recent
decisions
to
deny
the
petition
without
a
hearing
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
jack
k.
weber
that's
correct
yes
your
honor.
mr.
jack
k.
weber
although
of
course
we
do
dispute
â€“
mr.
jack
k.
weber
we
do
dispute
the
truth
â€“
mr.
jack
k.
weber
we
do
dispute
the
truth
of
the
allegations
in
the
petition.
mr.
jack
k.
weber
well
--
mr.
jack
k.
weber
of
course
if
the
writ
is
granted
in
superior
court
the
state
would
have
a
right
of
appeal.
so
that
would
be
one
situation
where
a
transcript
would
be
necessary.
mr.
jack
k.
weber
well,
some
of
these
procedures
help
the
state
occasionally,
again
the
transcript
could
be
used
by
one
party
or
the
other
on
the--
mr.
jack
k.
weber
no,
i
don't
think.
mr.
jack
k.
weber
i
wouldn't
agree
with
that.
i
noticed
that
the
federal
courts
have
a
power
to
order
the
transcript
made
up
from
the
reporter's
notes
also,
so
that
it
does
bear
on
the
federal
determination
as
well
as
the
state
determination.
mr.
jack
k.
weber
excuse
me.
mr.
jack
k.
weber
yes,
but
the
federal
courts
have
a
power
in
determining
state
habeas
corpus
petitions
to
order
the
transcript
of
this
particular
evidentiary
hearing.
so
that
would
be
a
situation
in
which
the
petitioner
would
benefit
from
the
preparation
of
a
transcript.
mr.
jack
k.
weber
well
we
have
forms
provided
for
the
petitioners
and
they
--
mr.
jack
k.
weber
no,
your
honor
i
think
it
goes
a
little
beyond
that
and
that
our
procedures
are
adequate
to
give
meaningful
habeas
corpus
to
indigent
prisoners
as
well
as
those
who
have
some
funds.
if
there
are
no
further
questions
i
will
submit.
