justice
abe
fortas
which
transcript
was
necessary
for
him
to
have?
justice
abe
fortas
you're
not
asking
that
the
government
supply
that
the
state
should
supply
the
transcript
of
the
original
trial?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
rickershauser,
do
you
know
whether
this
procedure
that
my
brother
stewart
was
talking
about
is
peculiar
to
california
whether
there
are
other
states
and
if
so
how
many?
you
have
the
same
procedure
that
is
to
say
that
don't
permit
appeals
and
post
conviction
proceedings,
but
that
do
provide
for
original
proceedings
in
the
superior
court.
justice
abe
fortas
i
would
be
interested
in
having
that,
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
rickershauser,
do
you
know
what
happens
in
the
supreme
court
of
california
when
a
habeas
petition
is
filed,
and
the
court
decides
to
hear
it,
does
the
court
hear
it,
suppose
the
evidence
has
to
be
taken,
do
they
ever
take
evidence
before
the
court,
do
they
appoint
a
master?
justice
abe
fortas
hey
don't
customarily
then
rely
on
the
transcript
of
the
lower
courts?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
his
hearing
came
to
a
--
not
in
the
superior
court
and
the
court
in
some
instances,
the
supreme
court
in
some
instances
will
review
that
transcript
to
determine
whether
there
was
error
in
it,
why
shouldn't
he
have
the
opportunity
to
have
that
before
the
court?
justice
abe
fortas
curb
what?
justice
abe
fortas
just
pecuniary
matter
insofar
the
state
is
concerned.
justice
abe
fortas
how
often
does
the
state
supreme
court
have
a
master
upon
it
or
referee
upon
it,
is
that
a
matter
of
common
practice
or
is
it
very
rare?
justice
abe
fortas
but
at
the
time
this
appellate
procedure
was
established
in
california,
habeas
corpus
did
not
have
the
scope
that
it
has
now,
did
it?
in
those
days
all
of
--
you
could
prove
on,
habeas
corpus
was
always
necessary
for
the
state
to
prove,
as
in
a
warrant
of
arrest
had
been
issued
and
the
man
had
been
then
arraigned
and
so
forth
and
if
those
things
had
been
complied
with,
the
writ
is
denied,
isn't
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
that's
been
expanded
in
more
recent
years.
justice
abe
fortas
but
this
right
to
a
transcript
has
not
been
expanded
in
accordance
with
that
different
procedure.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
weber
suppose
all
of
the
facts
stated
in
the
petition
in
the
superior
court
were
true;
would
the
supreme
court
--
would
they
be
sufficient
to
grant
a
hearing
in
the
supreme
court.
justice
abe
fortas
in
this
particular
case.
justice
abe
fortas
so
you
take
the
position
that
even
if
all
the
allegations
of
the
petition
in
the
superior
court
were
true
that
he
would
not
be
entitled
to
any
relief?
justice
abe
fortas
i
beg
your
pardon?
justice
abe
fortas
i
can't
hear
you.
justice
