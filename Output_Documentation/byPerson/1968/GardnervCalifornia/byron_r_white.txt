justice
byron
r.
white
well,
could
you
tell
me
whether
i
gather
from
what
you
say
that
sometimes
there
are
hearings
in
the
supreme
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
when
you
file
a
new
petition
in
the
supreme
court
instead
of
appealing,
sometimes
as
a
hearing.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
why
wouldn't
you,
if
they
wouldn't
give
you
the
transcript
of
what
occurred
in
the
lower
court,
why
wouldn't
you
ask
for
a
hearing,
so
you
could
make
a
record
and
give
the
--
put
the
evidence
before
the
court
of
-–
the
supreme
court
of
california.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
think
that
you
have
--
are
you
claiming
the
constitutional
right
not
to
have
to
ask
for
that
hearing?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
is
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
prepared
the
petition
for
the
hearing,
petition
without
such
a
transcript
in
the
lower
court
and
got
a
hearing
on
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
understand
but
the
petition
was
filed
in
the
lower
court
and
then
a
hearing
on
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
is
there
any
reason
to
suspect
that
you
couldn't
have
got
a
hearing
in
the
supreme
court
of
california,
if
the
supreme
court
of
california
refused
to
call
up
the
record
from
the
lower
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
true,
but
it's
never
been
denied
yet
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
did
you
ever
ask
them
for
a
hearing?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
they,
so
that
--
you'd
come
here
with,
you
come
here
in
a
situation
where
they
wouldn't
call
up
the
record
in
those
kind
of
court
and
wouldn't
give
you
a
hearing.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
neither
did
the
supreme
court
of
california
--
justice
byron
r.
white
if
the
court
was
denying
the
transcript
you
still
have
left
over
the
question
of
whether
you
really
were
denied
anything
if
you
could
get
a
new
hearing
on
the
petition
for
habeas
corpus,
a
new
evidentiary
hearing
in
the
supreme
court
of
california.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
shouldn't
you
have
to
come
here
with
the
--
after
they've
denied
you
a
hearing?
let's
assume
they
bring
your
petition
for
a
hearing,
you
filed
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
the
california
supreme
court
and
they
granted
you
a
hearing
on
it
and
you
had
an
evidentiary
hearing.
then
i
don't
suppose,
you'd
have
any
constitutional
claim
for
the
transcript
in
the
lower
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then
why
shouldn't
you
have
to
come
here
having
them
been
denied
both
the
transcript
and
the
hearing?
justice
byron
r.
white
can
you
file
a
petition
in
habeas
in
the
trial
court
and
the
allegations
being
by
the
trial
court
such
as
making
a
hearing
in
the
trial
court,
to
repeat
identical
allegations
filed
either
in
the
court
of
appeals
or
the
supreme
court
either
those
courts
may
claim
the
insufficiency
of
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
the
way
it
works,
there
is
no
appeal
whether
you
are
right
or
wrong,
what
the
trial
court
did
or
(inaudible)
court
of
appeals
or
--
justice
byron
r.
white
don't
you
do
though
on
direct
appeals
from
conviction?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
what
about
my
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
automatically?
justice
byron
r.
white
without
any
--
justice
byron
r.
white
a
moment
ago,
a
moment
ago
you
referred
to
what
would
go
on
in
the
supreme
court
of
california
after
the
petitioner
files
his
petition
for
habeas
corpus
there
after
it
is
denied
in
the
lower
court.
he
makes
his
allegations
and
you
refer
to
his
alleging
what
went
on
in
the
lower
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
as
a
matter
of
practice,
if
i
petition
for
habeas
corpus
in
the
superior
court
and
i
am
denied
after
a
hearing
and
then
i
file
petition
for
habeas
corpus
in
the
supreme
court
of
california,
well
in
the
appellate
court
and
then
the
supreme
court.
i
finally
file
one
at
the
supreme
court
of
california
and
all
i
do
is
make
the
--
put
the
same
allegations
in
it
that
i
put
in
the
superior
court,
that's
all
i
did.
now
if
the
supreme
court
of
california
thinks
those
allegations
are
sufficient
to
grant
the
writ
if
they
are
true,
what
do
they
do
at
that
point?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
what
happens?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
supreme
court
of
california
at
that
point
if
they
think
that
they
need
some
that
if
there
is
some;
they
need
to
find
out
whether
these
allegations
are
true
or
false.
do
they
ever
call
for
the
transcript
of
the
lower
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
if
their
exclusive
method
of
resolving
evidentiary
conflicts
in
the
supreme
court
on
petitions
for
habeas
corpus
where
the
state
and
the
petitioner
cannot
agree
from
the
facts.
the
exclusive
method
resolving
those
is
by
having
a
hearing
there
before
a
referee
and
they
make
their
own
resolution
of
the
facts.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if,
but
i
don't
suppose
that
if
either
party
refused
to
accept
that
transcript,
i
suppose
there
would
have
to
be
a
new
hearing?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
do
you
think
there
is
any
more
or
likely
that
the
supreme
court
would
grant
a
petition
for
habeas
corpus
filed
in
that
court
if
the
petitioner
there
can
make
allegations
about
what
went
on
in
the
lower
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
you
were
representing
an
individual
petitioning
for
habeas
corpus
in
the
supreme
court
of
california
after
a
denial
in
the
superior
court?
would
you
think
the
transcript
of
what
went
on
before
the
superior
court
in
that
evidentiary
hearing
there,
would
that
transcript
be
useful?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
justice
marshall
you
might
have
the
transcript
and
you
could
say
or
without
the
transcript
you
could
say
it
was
found
in
the
contrary
in
lower
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
you
did
what
if
you
did
get
the
record
and
you
attached
a
part
of
the
transcript
to
your
return,
so
he
did
have
counsel
and
here
is
what
was
found
by
the
superior
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
are
you
suggesting
though
then
that
hypothetical
case,
the
supreme
court
might
not
deny
on
the
basis
--
deny
the
petition
or
deny
a
hearing
on
the
basis
of
the
hearing
in
the
superior
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
could
you
tell
me
whether
i
gather
from
what
you
say
that
sometimes
there
are
hearings
in
the
supreme
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
when
you
file
a
new
petition
in
the
supreme
court
instead
of
appealing,
sometimes
as
a
hearing.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
why
wouldn't
you,
if
they
wouldn't
give
you
the
transcript
of
what
occurred
in
the
lower
court,
why
wouldn't
you
ask
for
a

so
you
could
make
a

and
give
the
--
put

before

justice
byron

white
but
you
think
that
you
have
--
are
you
claiming
the
constitutional
right
not
to
have
to
ask
for
that
hearing?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
is
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
prepared
the
petition
for
the
hearing,
petition
without
such
a
transcript
in
the
lower
court
and
got
a
hearing
on
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
understand
but
the
petition
was
filed
in
the
lower
court
and
then
a
hearing
on
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
is
there
any
reason
to
suspect
that
you
couldn't
have
got
a
hearing
in
the
supreme
court
of
california,
if
the
supreme
court
of
california
refused
to
call
up
the
record
from
the
lower
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
true,
but
it's
never
been
denied
yet
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
did
you
ever
ask
them
for
a
hearing?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
they,
so
that
--
you'd
come
here
with,
you
come
here
in
a
situation
where
they
wouldn't
call
up
the
record
in
those
kind
of

and
wouldn't
give
you
a

justice
byron

and
neither
did
the

if

you
still

a

in

justice
byron
r.
white
why
shouldn't
you
have
to
come
here
with
the
--
after
they've
denied
you
a
hearing?
let's
assume
they
bring
your
petition
for
a

you
filed
a

of
habeas

in
the
california
supreme

and
they
granted

a

then
i
don't
suppose,
you'd
have
any
constitutional

justice
byron

well
then
why

you
