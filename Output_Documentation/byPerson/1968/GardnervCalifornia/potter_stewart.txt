justice
potter
stewart
you
say
that
is
theoretical,
that
is
fact;
isn't
it;
in
other
words
and
it
works.
it
may
work
to
the
benefit
of
the
applicant
because
if
this
is
not
an
appeal
but
rather
an
original
new
application
for
habeas
corpus
in
the
second
court
then
the
applicant
is
free
to
bring
in
additional
material,
which
he
would
not
normally
be
free
to
do,
if
this
were
simply
a
review
of
the
district
court
action.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
not
unlike
the
federal
system
i
expect.
justice
potter
stewart
where
i
think
i'm
right
in
saying
that
under
the
statute
an
original
writ
of
habeas
corpus
could
be
brought
either
to
federal
district
court
or
before
a
circuit
judge
or
the
whole
court
of
appeals
or
before
any
justice
or
before
this
whole
court,
but
the
practice
is
that
it's
authorized
by
the
statute
of
federal
system
to
transfer
any
such
applications
filed
in
the
particular
circuit
judges
or
supreme
court
justices
to
transfer
it
to
the
district
court,
is
that
more
or
less
the
california
practice?
justice
potter
stewart
of
course
in
the
federal
system,
there
is
provision
for
appeals
from
denials
of
habeas
corpus
and
as
i
understand
it
in
california
there's
no
appeal
from
a
denial.
justice
potter
stewart
no,
i'm
not
appealed
for
the
denial
asset
of
habeas
corpus
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
as
i
read
your
trial
judge's
order,
he
may
clear
that
the
appellate
court
if
it
so
minded
was
free
to
ask
for
the
transcript
of
what
had
gone
on
in
the
habeas
corpus
proceeding
in
the
trial
court,
didn't
i
read
that
correctly,
i
don't
have
it.
justice
potter
stewart
where
does
that
show
in
the
record
that
the
appellate
court
denied
a
hearing
on
your
application?
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
what
we
had
here
and
perhaps
not
quite
wrong,
i
thought
what
we
had
here
was
simply
the
denial
of
the
trial
court
to
supply
your
client
a
free
transcript
of
the
hearing
to
be
used
by
him
in
his
new
application
for
habeas
corpus
in
the
appellate
court.
i
thought
that's
what
we
had
before
us
here.
justice
potter
stewart
but
this
case
is
an
attack,
is
it
not
upon
the
denial
of
the
trial
court
by
request
for
a
free,
for
a
free
transcript
of
the
habeas
corpus
proceedings
in
the
trial
court
to
be
used
by
your
client,
he
says
necessary
for
him
to
have
in
order
to
file
an
application
for
habeas
corpus
in
the
appellate
court?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
in
a
hearing
--
concludes
in
the
hearing
and
fact
finding
was
handed
against
the
petitioner,
nevertheless
may
the
petitioner
file
that
same
complaint
in
the
court
of
appeals
or
the
supreme
court
and
perhaps
get
another
hearing
even
though
this
may
result
in
the
perhaps
a
contrary
fact
find?
justice
potter
stewart
well
if
the,
if
they
--
supreme,
if
this
in
the
supreme
court
mr.
weber,
and
it's
finally
concluded
that
there
has
to
be
live
testimony
taken
before
someone,
before
whom
is
it
heard?
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
also
true
in
the
intermediate
court
of
appeals?
justice
potter
stewart
reference
to
a
referee?
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
know
mr.
weber
the
answer
of
the
question
or
not,
mr.
justice
fortas
just
asked
whether
other
states
have
the
same
procedure?
justice
potter
stewart
hold
on
mr.
weber
let's
take
a
rather
simple
case.
suppose
his
allegation
is,
i
was
tried
and
convicted
and
did
not
have
the
assistance
of
counsel
and
that's
his
petition
for
habeas
corpus
in
the
superior
court,
there
is
a
hearing
in
the
superior
court
or
does
it,
at
the
conclusion
of
the
hearing
the
trial
judge
concludes
that
the
fact
that
is
contrary
he
did
have
the
assistance
of
counsel.
now
he
then
goes
in
the
supreme
court
with
the
identical
petition,
i
didn't
have
the
assistance
of
counsel
at
my
trial
and
suggesting
that
in
the
face
of
a
finding
to
the
contrary
that
the
supreme
court
would
be
interested
with
the
transcript
to
go
ahead
and
have
it's
own
hearing
in
that
petition.
