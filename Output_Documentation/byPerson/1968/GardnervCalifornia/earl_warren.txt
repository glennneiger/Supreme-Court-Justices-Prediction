chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
rickershauser
and
i
see
that
we
had
a
number
of
894
miscellaneous
1967
term,
number
1001
miscellaneous
1967
term
which
were
respectively
the
petitions
for
cert
in
the
superior
court
of
california
apparently
denying
petition
for
mandamus
and
the
petition
for
a
cert
to
the
california
supreme
court,
and
the
last
one
the
petition
is
filed
for
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
california
supreme
court
whereas,
as
best
to
review
the
order
denying
the
petition
for
habeas
corpus,
isn't
that
right?
chief

earl
warren
and
did
you
say
to
us
that
those
were
filed
were
timely
file.
chief

i
see
but
those
other
cases
that
are
before
us
and
have
not
been
acted
on,
they're
petitions,
is
that
right?
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
we
do
have
up
here
regardless
of
how
our
writ
ran,
we
do
have
here
a
petition
for
certiorari
which
has
not
been
acted
on
asking
us
to
review
the
refusal
of
the

to
grant
habeas
