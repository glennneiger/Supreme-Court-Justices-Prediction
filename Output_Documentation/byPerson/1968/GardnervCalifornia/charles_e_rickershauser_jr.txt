mr.
charles
e.
rickershauser,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
case
involving
the
right
of
an
indigent
california
prisoner
to
a
free
transcript
of
his
hearing
out
of
petition
for
habeas
corpus
in
the
california
superior
court.
that
petitioner
alleged
insufficient
access
to
legal
materials
and
to
the
courts.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
under
the
facts
of
the
case,
petitioner
can
obtain
an
adequate
appellate
review
consistent
with
due
process
and
equal
protection
under
the
california
habeas
corpus
procedures
where
a
non-indigent
prisoner
could
have
purchased
this
transcript.
but
the
appellate
procedures
in
california
relating
to
habeas
corpus
cases
are
not
conditioned
as
a
matter
of
law
on
the
availability
of
that
transcript.
following
the
hearing,
the
superior
court
denied
the
petitioners
petition
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
petitioner
then
filed
a
written
motion
for
a
free
transcript
alleging
his
lack
of
funds,
his
need
for
the
transcript
to
prove
his
case
claims
in
the
california
supreme
court
and
to
assist
him
in
the
preparation
of
his
case.
petitioner
did
not
then
and
does
not
now
complain
about
the
hearing,
but
instead
contends
the
evidence
will
prove
his
habeas
corpus
contentions.
petitioner
in
his
motion
raised
the
federal
questions
presented
here
citing
authorities.
the
superior
court
denied
that
motion
by
written
order
stating
among
other
things
that
none
of
the
proceedings
in
that
court
would
be
of
concern
to
the
california
appellate
courts.
petitioner
sought
review
of
that
denial
of
his
motion
for
a
free
transcript
by
petitioning
for
writ
of
certiorari
in
the
california
court
of
appeal,
which
was
denied.
petitioner
then
sought
a
hearing
in
the
california
supreme
court
which
was
denied.
both
of
those
denials
were
without
opinion.
petitioner
then
petitioned
this
court
for
a
writ
of
certiorari,
which
was
granted
after
a
response
was
filed
by
the
state
of
california
upon
request.
this
court
then
appointed
counsel,
the
only
time
the
petitioner
has
been
represented
in
these
proceedings
by
counsel
except
at
the
hearing
on
his
petition
for
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
the
california
superior
court.
it
is
a
transcript
of
that
hearing
for
the
purpose
of
presenting
his
contentions
for
habeas
corpus
to
the
california
appellate
courts,
this
court
and
if
necessary
the
lower
federal
courts
that
petitioner
is
here
seeking.
it
seems
clear
under
various
decisions
of
this
court
most
recent
prominent
one
of
which
is
long
versus
district
court
385
u.s.
192
that
if
the
californian
habeas
corpus
procedure
was
a
traditional
appellate
procedure,
equal
protection
would
require
that
this
transcript
be
furnished
to
petitioner
so
that
he
could
have
the
same
means
of
pursuing
his
remedies
as
man
with
means
to
purchase
the
transcript.
the
difference
if
any,
in
this
case
is
that
habeas
corpus
in
california
is
termed
as
a
theoretical
matter
to
be
an
original
writ
procedure
in
each
of
the
court's
of
california
and
theoretically
--
mr.
charles
e.
rickershauser,
jr.
that
is
true
mr.
justice
stewart
but
in
practice
it
seems
to
me
we
have
to
look
at
the
california
procedure
and
see
how
it
usually
works
and
i
think
we
will
see
that
is
very
much
like
an
appellate
procedure
in
the
usual
case
and
of
course
even
if
it
isn't
i
think
the
petitioner
has
shown
his
need
for
that
transcript
to
prepare
for
the
appellate
court
review,
but
if
i
might
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
even
though
the
petitioner
is
theoretically
able
to
proceed
and
either
the
superior
court
or
the
appellate
courts
of
california
in
an
original
proceedings,
as
a
general
matter
and
the
usual
practice
as
established
in
the
state's
brief
here
as
referred
to,
is
that
the
appellate
courts
will
require
him
to
start
in
the
trial
court.
so
the
next
aspect
--
mr.
charles
e.
rickershauser,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
charles
e.
rickershauser,
jr.
i
believe
the
more
common
practice
is
to
deny
the
application
for
habeas
corpus,
it's
referred
to
a
footnote
in
the
state's
brief
on
the
ground
that
he
should
proceed
in
the
trial
court,
absent
some
unusual
circumstances
of
the
trial
court
would
not
act.
mr.
charles
e.
rickershauser,
jr.
there
is
an
appeal
by
the
state
if
the
petition
is
granted.
mr.
charles
e.
rickershauser,
jr.
well,
that
is
correct.
however,
in
many
times
the
subsequent
proceedings
in
the
appellate
court
have
the
same
effect
as
an
appeal,
because
the
appellate
courts
often
limit
their
review
to
the
record
before
the
trial
court
and
that
is
all
that
was
asked
here
since
there
was
no
complaint
about
the
hearing
in
the
trial
court
or
that
it
was
insufficient
or
that
additional
evidence
would
be
required
in
the
appellate
court.
mr.
charles
e.
rickershauser,
jr.
that
is
correct
mr.
justice.
the
appellate
court
could
have
ordered
that
transcript.
our
position
is
that
in
order
to
get
the
appellate
court
to
take
the
case
is
essential
to
this
indigent
petitioner
to
have
that
transcript
available
both
in
aid
of
preparation
of
his
case
and
in
establishing
his
case
at
the
discretion
of
the
appellate
court
to
take
it
or
not
because
--
mr.
charles
e.
rickershauser,
jr.
the
transcript
of
the
hearing
on
a
petition
for
habeas
corpus
in
the
trial
court.
mr.
charles
e.
rickershauser,
jr.
no
sir.
this
petition
for
habeas
corpus
contented
that
he
was
denied
insufficient
access
to
the
courts
and
to
legal
materials,
which
had
it
been
established,
i
assume
would
have
then
proceeded
to
attack
his
prior
conviction
and
well
he's
in
on
two
different
crimes
one
of
which
he
pleaded
guilty
to.
mr.
charles
e.
rickershauser,
jr.
i'm
sorry
mr.
justice
fortas
i
do
not
know
the
answer
to
that
question.
i'd
attempt
to
supply
it
if
you
would
desire
me
to
do
so.
mr.
charles
e.
rickershauser,
jr.
alright.
it
stems
from
the
original
common
law
practice
so
that
it's
reasonable
to
suppose
that
it
exists
in
other
states
but
i
can't
actually
answer
the
question.
mr.
charles
e.
rickershauser,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
e.
rickershauser,
jr.
it's
correct
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
charles
e.
rickershauser,
jr.
we
would
ask
for
a
hearing
and
as
depending
--
mr.
charles
e.
rickershauser,
jr.
no,
i
am
claiming
that
in
order
to
get
that
hearing
it
is
necessary
to
have
this
transcript.
mr.
charles
e.
rickershauser,
jr.
because
as
both
in
aid
of
preparation
of
the
petition
for
the
hearing
and
in
proving
to
the
court
--
mr.
charles
e.
rickershauser,
jr.
that's
correct.
you
understand
that
i
didn't
sir.
mr.
charles
e.
rickershauser,
jr.
that's
right,
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
e.
rickershauser,
jr.
i
am
not
sure
i
follow
your
question
is,
the
supreme
court
of
california
does
not
have
to
grant
a
hearing
on
the
petitions.
mr.
charles
e.
rickershauser,
jr.
yes,
it
has.
it's
pending
here
on
certiorari.
mr.
charles
e.
rickershauser,
jr.
yes.
mr.
charles
e.
rickershauser,
jr.
that
is
correct.
we
do
not
know
what
happened
at
that
hearing
in
the
trial
court
as
a
result
of
any
subsequent
proceedings
and
neither
has
there
been
another
hearing
in
any
of
the
--
mr.
charles
e.
rickershauser,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
charles
e.
rickershauser,
jr.
well,
the
only
proceeding
that's
before
the
court
in
this
case
is
the
request
for
the
hearing.
i
believe
the
court
could
take
notice
of
the
fact
that
two
other
petitions
for
certiorari
are
pending
in
this
court
at
this
time
relating
to
the
subsequent
proceedings
in
this
petitioner's
attempt
to
obtain
habeas
corpus
--
mr.
charles
e.
rickershauser,
jr.
well
it's
really
arguable
i
guess
what
you
have
before
you
because
the
petitioner
took
that
denial
to
the
california
court
of
appeal
by
writ
of
certiorari
and
then
took
that
to
the
supreme
court
of
california
by
petition
for
a
hearing,
both
of
which
were
denied.
he
then
came
here
for
a
writ
of
certiorari
which
was
granted.
direct
to
the
superior
court
of
california
although
we
have
treated
it
in
our
brief
as
directed
to
the
supreme
court,
i
think
it
would
apply
to
either
case,
either
court.
now
subsequently
he
has
pursued
his
habeas
corpus
remedies
in
the
california
appellate
courts
and
has
filed
some
petitions
for
certiorari.
those
--
that
is
not
this
case,
those
cases
are
pending
here.
mr.
charles
e.
rickershauser,
jr.
that
is
correct
mr.
justice.
point
where
i
was
discussing
that
the
fact
that
the
california
procedure
has
developed
appellate
similarities,
i
do
not
think
is
required
in
establishing
our
case.
we
do
not
ask
this
court
to
say
that
california
in
fact
has
an
appellate
remedy;
we're
just
showing
that
it
has
some
of
the
same
aspects
and
is
therefore
makes
the
need
for
this
transcript
even
greater
under
those
circumstances,
and
it
is
not
always
the
tradition
to
grant
separate
hearings
to
consider
these
records
separately.
i
think
the
basic
considerations
underlying
the
transcript
cases,
which
are
that
an
indigent
prisoner
is
to
be
afforded
an
adequate
means
of
review
in
the
appellate
courts
as
a
man
with
means,
require
the
furnishing
of
this
transcript.
it
seems
to
us
that
the
facts
of
this
case
uniquely
demonstrate
the
essential
aspect
of
this
transcript.
this
petitioner
in
his
habeas
corpus
petition
is
asking,
is
claiming
that
he
is
denied
access
to
the
courts.
this
is
obviously
a
problem
with
complexity
in
which
the
courts
must
weigh
his
liberty
and
his
rights
against
the
right
of
the
institutional
authorities
to
run
the
prison,
a
complex
problem
and
it
is
exceedingly
--
it
is
almost
unbelievable
that
a
man
who
had
means
would
not
purchase
the
transcript
of
this
hearing
in
the
trial
court
in
order
to
assist
him
in
the
preparation
of
his
papers
in
the
appellate
courts.
and
also
to
demonstrate
to
the
appellate
courts
how
it
is
that
he
was
denied
access
to,
which
would
certainly
be
of
assistance
to
a
court
in
determining
whether
or
not
there
was
the
kind
of
denial
of
access
that
would
be
a
deprivation
of
his
rights.
it
is
our
view
therefore
that
there
is
that
kind
of
invidious
discrimination
between
the
prisoner
of
means
and
the
prisoner
without
means
that
the
transcript
cases
have
discussed.
mr.
charles
e.
rickershauser,
jr.
my
understanding
mr.
justice
fortas
is
that
a
master
is
appointed
or
a
referee,
and
that
a
transcript
is
obtained
of
that
proceeding,
which
is
then
reviewed
by
the
court
to
the
extent
necessary
to
reach
a
decision.
mr.
charles
e.
rickershauser,
jr.
well
there
are
circuit
court,
court
of
appeals
cases
in
which
they
have
relied
on
it,
and
i
am
sure
they
would
in
this
case
had
they
granted
a
hearing
because
the
petitioner
doesn't
seek
to
establish
anything
beyond
that
transcript.
this
isn't
a
case
where
he
is
asking
for
the
transcript
in
order
to
comment
for
errors
that
he
might
then
urge
on
in
an
appellate
court.
i
can't,
that's
obviously
some
speculation
as
to
what
they
would
do.
i
would
like
to
mention
one
or
two
of
the
state's
contentions,
first
one
of
which
significant
seems
to
be
that
there
are
not
sufficient
particular
allegations
of
the
need
for
the
transcript.
we
feel
that
a
layman
with
a
problem
such
as
this
trying
to
establish
that
he
does
not
have
adequate
access
to
the
courts
when
on
the
face
of
it
he
is
in
court,
has
alleged
all
that
any
layman
ought
to
have
to
allege
in
expressing
his
need
for
this
transcript,
especially
when
he
contends
that
he
is
willing
to
rely
on
it
and
that
he
had
a
fair
hearing
in
that
trial
court.
mr.
charles
e.
rickershauser,
jr.
mr.
justice
brennan
i
am
not
with
you
on
page
22
--
mr.
charles
e.
rickershauser,
jr.
62
i
am
sorry.
mr.
charles
e.
rickershauser,
jr.
i
think
i
mentioned
a
few
moments
ago
that
it
is
not
actually
clear
from
an
arguable
standpoint
as
to
what
is
here.
it
is
true
that
the
writ
does
run
to
the
superior
court
in
the
state
of
california.
mr.
charles
e.
rickershauser,
jr.
that
is
the
order
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
charles
e.
rickershauser,
jr.
mr.
justice
brennan
your
writ
ran
to
the
order
of
the
superior
court
on
page
43
of
the
appendix.
mr.
charles
e.
rickershauser,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
e.
rickershauser,
jr.
that
order
will
take
court
of
appeals
in
california
by
writ
of
certiorari
under
the
procedures
of
that
state,
on
which
there
is
no
decision
establishing
that
that's
either
the
correct
or
the
incorrect
procedure.
no
clear
decision
and
was
then
taken
to
the
california
supreme
court
--
mr.
charles
e.
rickershauser,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
charles
e.
rickershauser,
jr.
i
am
sorry.
mr.
charles
e.
rickershauser,
jr.
in
the
petition
for
certiorari,
we
asked
for
the
supplying
of
the
transcript
below
and
i
assume
there
would
be
a
hearing,
now
the
procedure
in
the
california
supreme
court
is
a
petition
for
a
hearing,
which
has
the
discretionary
aspects
of
a
petition
for
certiorari
here.
mr.
charles
e.
rickershauser,
jr.
no
sir.
that
is
the
way
you
petition
the
supreme
court
for
a
hearing
on
--
mr.
charles
e.
rickershauser,
jr.
no
sir
i
may
have
misled
you
or
not
understood
your
question.
mr.
charles
e.
rickershauser,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
e.
rickershauser,
jr.
that's
correct.
it
is
a
luxury
perhaps
that
petitioner
is
here
in
time
on
the
orders
both
of
the
superior
court
and
of
the
supreme
court.
mr.
charles
e.
rickershauser,
jr.
well
it
would
only
be
proper
on
your
writ
mr.
justice
brennan
if
the
order
of
the
superior
court
was
the
last
order
possible
in
the
state
court
system
and
i
don't,
if
it
was
final
judgment
of
the
final
court
and
would
not
appeal
which
is
far
--
mr.
charles
e.
rickershauser,
jr.
our
view
is
that
it's
not
the
case
because
it
could
have
been
taken
out
from
certiorari,
the
attorney
general
questions
that
in
his
brief.
but
i
think
it's
correct
and
i
think
it
would
be
more
appropriate
although
certainly
up
to
this
court
to
--
mr.
charles
e.
rickershauser,
jr.
that's
correct
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
don't
think
there
is
any
question
about
that
issue
being
before
you
if
you
should
have
the
supreme
court
denial
on
hearing
before
you
leave
it.
mr.
charles
e.
rickershauser,
jr.
that's
the
issue
that
was
raised
in
the
request
for
-
mr.
charles
e.
rickershauser,
jr.
the
question
really
i
think
mr.
justice
white
is
whether
we
needed
that
transcript
in
a
constitutional
sense
in
an
application
for
that
hearing.
mr.
charles
e.
rickershauser,
jr.
prepare
and
to
convince
the
court
and
incidentally
the
california
statute
requires
us
to
make
a
brief
description
of
the
proceedings
below,
so
that
--
mr.
charles
e.
rickershauser,
jr.
i
think
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
e.
rickershauser,
jr.
well,
my
reaction
to
that
is
that
at
that
point
we
would
have
lost
our
right
to
attack
the
order
below
in
the
trial
court
denying
the
transcript.
mr.
charles
e.
rickershauser,
jr.
i
think
that
would
be
another
way
to
raise
the
issue.
mr.
charles
e.
rickershauser,
jr.
that's
correct
mr.
justice.
mr.
charles
e.
rickershauser,
jr.
i
did
not
address
myself
the
timely
filing
of
that
one,
i
said
this
case
was
timely
filed
with
respect
to
the
order
both
of
the
trial
court
and
of
the
supreme
court
denying
a
hearing.
mr.
charles
e.
rickershauser,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
charles
e.
rickershauser,
jr.
that
is
correct,
that
is
correct.
i
was
discussing
the
state's
contention
as
to
the
specificity
of
the
allegations
and
i
think
the
final
state's
point
of,
that
i
would
like
to
discuss
is
that
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
the
transcript
cases
talk
about
the
state
may
provide
adequate
alternatives.
the
difficulty
i
have
with
that
here
is
that
there
is
no
adequate
alternative
that
we
are
able
to
determine
to
and
none
has
been
offered.
the
only
discussion
if
any
is
that
the
petitioner
alleged
with
particularity
what
happened
at
the
hearing.
this
i
think
is
an
undue
burden
upon
him,
one
that
a
man
with
means
would
not
assume
and
that
they're,
therefore
that
there
is
the
kind
of
discrimination
without
alternatives
that
the
transcript
cases
require
in
this
court
and
an
opinion
below
should
be
–
the
decision
below
should
be
reversed.
thank
you.
mr.
charles
e.
rickershauser,
jr.
i
have
nothing
further
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
charles
e.
rickershauser,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
case
involving
the
right
of
an
indigent
california
prisoner
to
a
free
transcript
of
his
hearing
out
of
petition
for
habeas
corpus
in
the
california
superior
court.
that
petitioner
alleged
insufficient
access
to
legal
materials
and
to
the
courts.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
under
the
facts
of
the
case,
petitioner
can
obtain
an
adequate
appellate
review
consistent
with
due
process
and
equal
protection
under
the
california
habeas
corpus
procedures
where
a
non-indigent
prisoner
could
have
purchased
this
transcript.
but
the
appellate
procedures
in
california
relating
to
habeas
corpus
cases
are
not
conditioned
as
a
matter
of
law
on
the
availability
of
that
transcript.
following
the
hearing,
the
superior
court
denied
the
petitioners
petition
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
petitioner
then
filed
a
written
motion
for
a
free
transcript
alleging
his
lack
of
funds,
his
need
for
the
transcript
to
prove
his
case
claims
in
the
california
supreme
court
and
to
assist
him
in
the
preparation
of
his
case.
petitioner
did
not
then
and
does
not
now
complain
about
the
hearing,
but
instead
contends
the
evidence
will
prove
his
habeas
corpus
contentions.
petitioner
in
his
motion
raised
the
federal
questions
presented
here
citing
authorities.
the
superior
court
denied
that
motion
by
written
order
stating
among
other
things
that
none
of
the
proceedings
in
that
court
would
be
of
concern
to
the
california
appellate
courts.
petitioner
sought
review
of
that
denial
of
his
motion
for
a
free
transcript
by
petitioning
for
writ
of
certiorari
in
the
california
court
of
appeal,
which
was
denied.
petitioner
then
sought
a
hearing
in
the
california
supreme
court
which
was
denied.
both
of
those
denials
were
without
opinion.
petitioner
then
petitioned
this
court
for
a
writ
of
certiorari,
which
was
granted
after
a
response
was
filed
by
the
state
of
california
upon
request.
this
court
then
appointed
counsel,
the
only
time
the
petitioner
has
been
represented
in
these
proceedings
by
counsel
except
at
the
hearing
on
his
petition
for
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
the
california
superior
court.
it
is
a
transcript
of
that
hearing
for
the
purpose
of
presenting
his
contentions
for
habeas
corpus
to
the
california
appellate
courts,
this
court
and
if
necessary
the
lower
federal
courts
that
petitioner
is
here
seeking.
it
seems
clear
under
various
decisions
of
this
court
most
recent
prominent
one
of
which
is
long
versus
district
court
385
u.s.
192
that
if
the
californian
habeas
corpus
procedure
was
a
traditional
appellate
procedure,
equal
protection
would
require
that
this
transcript
be
furnished
to
petitioner
so
that
he
could
have
the
same
means
of
pursuing
his
remedies
as
man
with
means
to
purchase
the
transcript.
the
difference
if
any,
in
this
case
is
that
habeas
corpus
in
california
is
termed
as
a
theoretical
matter
to
be
an
original
writ
procedure
in
each
of
the
court's
of
california
and
theoretically
--
mr.
charles
e.
rickershauser,
jr.
that
is
true
mr.
justice
stewart
but
in
practice
it
seems
to
me
we
have
to
look
at
the
california
procedure
and
see
how
it
usually
works
and
i
think
we
will
see
that
is
very
much
like
an
appellate
procedure
in
the
usual
case
and
of
course
even
if
it
isn't
i
think
the
petitioner
has
shown
his
need
for
that
transcript
to
prepare
for
the
appellate
court
review,
but
if
i
might
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
even
though
the
petitioner
is
theoretically
able
to
proceed
and
either
the
superior
court
or
the
appellate
courts
of
california
in
an
original
proceedings,
as
a
general
matter
and
the
usual
practice
as
established
in
the
state's
brief
here
as
referred
to,
is
that
the
appellate
courts
will
require
him
to
start
in
the
trial
court.
so
the
next
aspect
--
mr.
charles
e.
rickershauser,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
charles
e.
rickershauser,
jr.
i
believe
the
more
common
practice
is
to
deny
the
application
for
habeas
corpus,
it's
referred
to
a
footnote
in
the
state's
brief
on
the
ground
that
he
should
proceed
in
the
trial
court,
absent
some
unusual
circumstances
of
the
trial
court
would
not
act.
mr.
charles
e.
rickershauser,
jr.
there
is
an
appeal
by
the
state
if
the
petition
is
granted.
mr.
charles
e.
rickershauser,
jr.
well,
that
is
correct.
however,
in
many
times
the
subsequent
proceedings
in
the
appellate
court
have
the
same
effect
as
an
appeal,
because
the
appellate
courts
often
limit
their
review
to
the
record
before
the
trial
court
and
that
is
all
that
was
asked
here
since
there
was
no
complaint
about
the
hearing
in
the
trial
court
or
that
it
was
insufficient
or
that
additional
evidence
would
be
required
in
the
appellate
court.
mr.
charles
e.
rickershauser,
jr.
that
is
correct
mr.
justice.
the
appellate
court
could
have
ordered
that
transcript.
our
position
is
that
in
order
to
get
the
appellate
court
to
take
the
case
is
essential
to
this
indigent
petitioner
to
have
that
transcript
available
both
in
aid
of
preparation
of
his
case
and
in
establishing
his
case
at
the
discretion
of
the
appellate
court
to
take
it
or
not
because
--
mr.
charles
e.
rickershauser,
jr.
the
transcript
of
the
hearing
on
a
petition
for
habeas
corpus
in
the
trial
court.
mr.
charles
e.
rickershauser,
jr.
no
sir.
this
petition
for
habeas
corpus
contented
that
he
was
denied
insufficient
access
to
the
courts
and
to
legal
materials,
which
had
it
been
established,
i
assume
would
have
then
proceeded
to
attack
his
prior
conviction
and
well
he's
in
on
two
different
crimes
one
of
which
he
pleaded
guilty
to.
mr.
charles
e.
rickershauser,
jr.
i'm
sorry
mr.
justice
fortas
i
do
not
know
the
answer
to
that
question.
i'd
attempt
to
supply
it
if
you
would
desire
me
to
do
so.
mr.
charles
e.
rickershauser,
jr.
alright.
it
stems
from
the
original
common
law
practice
so
that
it's
reasonable
to
suppose
that
it
exists
in
other
states
but
i
can't
actually
answer
the
question.
mr.
charles
e.
rickershauser,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
e.
rickershauser,
jr.
it's
correct
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
charles
e.
rickershauser,
jr.
we
would
ask
for
a
hearing
and
as
depending
--
mr.
charles
e.
rickershauser,
jr.
no,
i
am
claiming
that
in
order
to
get
that
hearing
it
is
necessary
to
have
this
transcript.
mr.
charles
e.
rickershauser,
jr.
because
as
both
in
aid
of
preparation
of
the
petition
for
the
hearing
and
in
proving
to
the
court
--
mr.
charles
e.
rickershauser,
jr.
that's
correct.
you
understand
that
i
didn't
sir.
mr.
charles
e.
rickershauser,
jr.
that's
right,
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
e.
rickershauser,
jr.
i
am
not
sure
i
follow
your
question
is,
the
supreme
court
of
california
does
not
have
to
grant
a
hearing
on
the
petitions.
mr.
charles
e.
rickershauser,
jr.
yes,
it
has.
it's
pending
here
on
certiorari.
mr.
charles
e.
rickershauser,
jr.
yes.
mr.
charles
e.
rickershauser,
jr.
that
is
correct.
we
do
not
know
what
happened
at
that
hearing
in
the
trial
court
as
a
result
of
any
subsequent
proceedings
and
neither
has
there
been
another
hearing
in
any
of
the
--
mr.
charles
e.
rickershauser,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
charles
e.
rickershauser,
jr.
well,
the
only
proceeding
that's
before
the
court
in
this
case
is
the
request
for
the
hearing.
i
believe
the
court
could
take
notice
of
the
fact
that
two
other
petitions
for
certiorari
are
pending
in
this
court
at
this
time
relating
to
the
subsequent
proceedings
in
this
petitioner's
attempt
to
obtain
habeas
corpus
--
mr.
charles
e.
rickershauser,
jr.
well
it's
really
arguable
i
guess
what
you
have
before
you
because
the
petitioner
took
that
denial
to
the
california
court
of
appeal
by
writ
of
certiorari
and
then
took
that
to
the
supreme
court
of
california
by
petition
for
a
hearing,
both
of
which
were
denied.
he
then
came
here
for
a
writ
of
certiorari
which
was
granted.
direct
to
the
superior
court
of
california
although
we
have
treated
it
in
our
brief
as
directed
to
the
supreme
court,
i
think
it
would
apply
to
either
case,
either
court.
now
subsequently
he
has
pursued
his
habeas
corpus
remedies
in
the
california
appellate
courts
and
has
filed
some
petitions
for
certiorari.
those
--
that
is
not
this
case,
those
cases
are
pending
here.
mr.
charles
e.
rickershauser,
jr.
that
is
correct
mr.
justice.
point
where
i
was
discussing
that
the
fact
that
the
california
procedure
has
developed
appellate
similarities,
i
do
not
think
is
required
in
establishing
our
case.
we
do
not
ask
this
court
to
say
that
california
in
fact
has
an
appellate
remedy;
we're
just
showing
that
it
has
some
of
the
same
aspects
and
is
therefore
makes
the
need
for
this
transcript
even
greater
under
those
circumstances,
and
it
is
not
always
the
tradition
to
grant
separate
hearings
to
consider
these
records
separately.
i
think
the
basic
considerations
underlying
the
transcript
cases,
which
are
that
an
indigent
prisoner
is
to
be
afforded
an
adequate
means
of
review
in
the
appellate
courts
as
a
man
with
means,
require
the
furnishing
of
this
transcript.
it
seems
to
us
that
the
facts
of
this
case
uniquely
demonstrate
the
essential
aspect
of
this
transcript.
this
petitioner
in
his
habeas
corpus
petition
is
asking,
is
claiming
that
he
is
denied
access
to
the
courts.
this
is
obviously
a
problem
with
complexity
in
which
the
courts
must
weigh
his
liberty
and
his
rights
against
the
right
of
the
institutional
authorities
to
run
the
prison,
a
complex
problem
and
it
is
exceedingly
--
it
is
almost
unbelievable
that
a
man
who
had
means
would
not
purchase
the
transcript
of
this
hearing
in
the
trial
court
in
order
to
assist
him
in
the
preparation
of
his
papers
in
the
appellate
courts.
and
also
to
demonstrate
to
the
appellate
courts
how
it
is
that
he
was
denied
access
to,
which
would
certainly
be
of
assistance
to
a
court
in
determining
whether
or
not
there
was
the
kind
of
denial
of
access
that
would
be
a
deprivation
of
his
rights.
it
is
our
view
therefore
that
there
is
that
kind
of
invidious
discrimination
between
the
prisoner
of
means
and
the
prisoner
without
means
that
the
transcript
cases
have
discussed.
mr.
charles
e.
rickershauser,
jr.
my
understanding
mr.
justice
fortas
is
that
a
master
is
appointed
or
a
referee,
and
that
a
transcript
is
obtained
of
that
proceeding,
which
is
then
reviewed
by
the
court
to
the
extent
necessary
to
reach
a
decision.
mr.
charles
e.
rickershauser,
jr.
well
there
are
circuit
court,
court
of
appeals
cases
in
which
they
have
relied
on
it,
and
i
am
sure
they
would
in
this
case
had
they
granted
a
hearing
because
the
petitioner
doesn't
seek
to
establish
anything
beyond
that
transcript.
this
isn't
a
case
where
he
is
asking
for
the
transcript
in
order
to
comment
for
errors
that
he
might
then
urge
on
in
an
appellate
court.
i
can't,
that's
obviously
some
speculation
as
to
what
they
would
do.
i
would
like
to
mention
one
or
two
of
the
state's
contentions,
first
one
of
which
significant
seems
to
be
that
there
are
not
sufficient
particular
allegations
of
the
need
for
the
transcript.
we
feel
that
a
layman
with
a
problem
such
as
this
trying
to
establish
that
he
does
not
have
adequate
access
to
the
courts
when
on
the
face
of
it
he
is
in
court,
has
alleged
all
that
any
layman
ought
to
have
to
allege
in
expressing
his
need
for
this
transcript,
especially
when
he
contends
that
he
is
willing
to
rely
on
it
and
that
he
had
a
fair
hearing
in
that
trial
court.
mr.
charles
e.
rickershauser,
jr.
mr.
justice
brennan
i
am
not
with
you
on
page
22
--
mr.
charles
e.
rickershauser,
jr.
62
i
am
sorry.
mr.
charles
e.
rickershauser,
jr.
i
think
i
mentioned
a
few
moments
ago
that
it
is
not
actually
clear
from
an
arguable
standpoint
as
to
what
is
here.
it
is
true
that
the
writ
does
run
to
the
superior
court
in
the
state
of
california.
mr.
charles
e.
rickershauser,
jr.
that
is
the
order
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
charles
e.
rickershauser,
jr.
mr.
justice
brennan
your
writ
ran
to
the
order
of
the
superior
court
on
page
43
of
the
appendix.
mr.
charles
e.
rickershauser,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
e.
rickershauser,
jr.
that
order
will
take
court
of
appeals
in
california
by
writ
of
certiorari
under
the
procedures
of
that
state,
on
which
there
is
no
decision
establishing
that
that's
either
the
correct
or
the
incorrect
procedure.
no
clear
decision
and
was
then
taken
to
the
california
supreme
court
--
mr.
charles
e.
rickershauser,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
charles
e.
rickershauser,
jr.
i
am
sorry.
mr.
charles
e.
rickershauser,
jr.
in
the
petition
for
certiorari,
we
asked
for
the
supplying
of
the
transcript
below
and
i
assume
there
would
be
a
hearing,
now
the
procedure
in
the
california
supreme
court
is
a
petition
for
a
hearing,
which
has
the
discretionary
aspects
of
a
petition
for
certiorari
here.
mr.
charles
e.
rickershauser,
jr.
no
sir.
that
is
the
way
you
petition
the
supreme
court
for
a
hearing
on
--
mr.
charles
e.
rickershauser,
jr.
no
sir
i
may
have
misled
you
or
not
understood
your
question.
mr.
charles
e.
rickershauser,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
e.
rickershauser,
jr.
that's
correct.
it
is
a
luxury
perhaps
that
petitioner
is
here
in
time
on
the
orders
both
of
the
superior
court
and
of
the
supreme
court.
mr.
charles
e.
rickershauser,
jr.
well
it
would
only
be
proper
on
your
writ
mr.
justice
brennan
if
the
order
of
the
superior
court
was
the
last
order
possible
in
the
state
court
system
and
i
don't,
if
it
was
final
judgment
of
the
final
court
and
would
not
appeal
which
is
far
--
mr.
charles
e.
rickershauser,
jr.
our
view
is
that
it's
not
the
case
because
it
could
have
been
taken
out
from
certiorari,
the
attorney
general
questions
that
in
his
brief.
but
i
think
it's
correct
and
i
think
it
would
be
more
appropriate
although
certainly
up
to
this
court
to
--
mr.
charles
e.
rickershauser,
jr.
that's
correct
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
don't
think
there
is
any
question
about
that
issue
being
before
you
if
you
should
have
the
supreme
court
denial
on
hearing
before
you
leave
it.
mr.
charles
e.
rickershauser,
jr.
that's
the
issue
that
was
raised
in
the
request
for
-
mr.
charles
e.
rickershauser,
jr.
the
question
really
i
think
mr.
justice
white
is
whether
we
needed
that
transcript
in
a
constitutional
sense
in
an
application
for
that
hearing.
mr.
charles
e.
rickershauser,
jr.
prepare
and
to
convince
the
court
and
incidentally
the
california
statute
requires
us
to
make
a
brief
description
of
the
proceedings
below,
so
that
--
mr.
charles
e.
rickershauser,
jr.
i
think
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
e.
rickershauser,
jr.
well,
my
reaction
to
that
is
that
at
that
point
we
would
have
lost
our
right
to
attack
the
order
below
in
the
trial
court
denying
the
transcript.
mr.
charles
e.
rickershauser,
jr.
i
think
that
would
be
another
way
to
raise
the
issue.
mr.
charles
e.
rickershauser,
jr.
that's
correct
mr.
justice.
mr.
charles
e.
rickershauser,
jr.
i
did
not
address
myself
the
timely
filing
of
that
one,
i
said
this
case
was
timely
filed
with
respect
to
the
order
both
of
the
trial
court
and
of
the
supreme
court
denying
a
hearing.
mr.
charles
e.
rickershauser,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
charles
e.
rickershauser,
jr.
that
is
correct,
that
is
correct.
i
was
discussing
the
state's
contention
as
to
the
specificity
of
the
allegations
and
i
think
the
final
state's
point
of,
that
i
would
like
to
discuss
is
that
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
the
transcript
cases
talk
about
the
state
may
provide
adequate
alternatives.
the
difficulty
i
have
with
that
here
is
that
there
is
no
adequate
alternative
that
we
are
able
to
determine
to
and
none
has
been
offered.
the
only
discussion
if
any
is
that
the
petitioner
alleged
with
particularity
what
happened
at
the
hearing.
this
i
think
is
an
undue
burden
upon
him,
one
that
a
man
with
means
would
not
assume
and
that
they're,
therefore
that
there
is
the
kind
of
discrimination
without
alternatives
that
the
transcript
cases
require
in
this
court
and
an
opinion
below
should
be
–
the
decision
below
should
be
reversed.
thank
you.
mr.
charles
e.
rickershauser,
jr.
i
have
nothing
further
mr.
chief
justice.
