i
am
looking
at
the
appendix

that
apparently
is
the
order
in
the
supreme

of
california,
titled
petition
for
hearing,

denying

denied
and
yet
our

runs
not
to

but
apparently
to
the
superior

and
63.
justice
william
j.
brennan,

now
may
i
just,
just
ask
there
looking
at
page
50,
that
would
appear
to
be
to
the
denial
of
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari,
is
that
it
in
the
district
court?
because
at
page
52,
the
order
seems
to
be
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
denied?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
is
that
what
this
--our
writ
ran
to,
to
that
order
and
not
to
the
order
of
page
62
of
the
supreme
court
of
california?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
43,
is
that
denying
a
transcript.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
appeal
that
order?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
where
you
ask
for
a
hearing?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
the
supreme
--
that's
like
petitioning
for
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
california.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
asked
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words
this
is
not
something
--
that
petition
for
hearing
in
the
supreme
court
of
california
is
not
something
peculiar
to
the
state
habeas
corpus?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
all
right,
now
i
am
getting.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
you
didn't
mislead
us
it's
just
that
those
labels,
apparently
petition
for
hearing,
it's
just
a
label
describing
a
procedure
of
the
supreme
court
of
california
and
review
of
almost
anything,
is
that
it?

justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
must
say
i
have
a
little
trouble
seeing
how
our
petition
runs
to
that
order
of
--
at
page
43,
rather
than
to
the
denial
of
the
order
denying
a
petition
for
certiorari
on
the
state.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
which
is
the
order,
at
43,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
got
it,
your
point
is
if
what's
before
us
then,
if
our
writ
runs
to
that
order
at
page
43,
then
there
is
indeed
before
us
the
question
you
raised
of
the
denial
of
the
transcript,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

i
see.

justice
william

this
well
you
wouldn't
have
to
use

but
then
you
could
come
here
and
say
that
we
have
a
petition
for
habeas
corpus,
and
they
won't
give
us
either
a
hearing
or
a
transcript.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
are
talking
about
an
appeal
from
a

you
are
not

about
an

from
