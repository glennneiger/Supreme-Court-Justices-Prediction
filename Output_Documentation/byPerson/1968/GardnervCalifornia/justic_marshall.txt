mr.
justic
marshall
how
can
a
supreme
court
find
an
error
in
the
record
below
if
it
doesn't
have
the
record?
mr.
justic
marshall
how
can
it
determine
that
he
is
not
entitled
to
have
those
allegations
considered
if
it
doesn't
have
the
record
upon,
which
they're
based?
mr.
justic
marshall
and
if
it
doesn't
find
those
allegations
sufficient,
what
course
does
the
supreme
court
take?
mr.
justic
marshall
doesn't
have,
then
it
doesn't
have
an
independent
hearing
of
its
own?
mr.
justic
marshall
mr.
weber,
in
this
original
paper
that
the
petitioner
files,
i
assume
the
state
files
a
response.
mr.
justic
marshall
well,
would
the
state
view
the
transcript?
mr.
justic
marshall
but
the
petitioner
couldn't
get—
mr.
justic
marshall
--
the
transcript?
mr.
justic
marshall
so
the
state
would
use
transcript
because
the
state
i
assume
has
the
means.
mr.
justic
marshall
so
the
state
would
use
the
transcript
for
its
pleadings,
but
would
deny
the
transcript
to
the
pauper.
mr.
justic
marshall
isn't
it
worse
when
pauper
without
a
lawyer
is
up
against
the
weight
of
the
whole
prosecuting
authority
of
the
state
of
california
plus
the
transcript?
mr.
justic
marshall
whether
they
have
money
or
not?
mr.
justic
marshall
let
me
ask
you
this
mr.
weber,
if
this
man
had
the
money
and
had
purchased
the
transcript,
could
it
have
been
used
in
the
supreme
court
to
determine
whether
he
was
entitled
to
hearing
that?
mr.
justic
marshall
then
if
he,
if
he
isn't
able
to
get
that
then
the
court
would
have
used
it.
then
he
has
suffered
some
deprivation,
as
he
not?
mr.
justic
marshall
well,
how
is
that
justified,
how,
on
the
part
of
the
state?
mr.
justic
marshall
for
the
discrimination
that
you
just
mentioned.
mr.
justic
marshall
it
seems
to
me
in
a
state
like
california
that
wouldn't
be
very
good
argument
because
if
the
man
is
a
millionaire
and
he
has
a
long
trial,
the
state
pays
for
his
transcript
on
appeal?
mr.
justic
marshall
why
shouldn't
an
indigent
have
it
in
a
situation
like
this
if
a
man
of
means
could
have
the
transcript
and
it
would
be
used
by
the
court
in
determining
the
merits
of
the
case?
mr.
justic
marshall
layman
without
a
lawyer?
mr.
justic
marshall
mr.
weber
excuse
me
--
mr.
justic
marshall
if
these
are
actual
de
novo
hearings,
independent
hearings
and
in
the
interest
of
not
wasting
money,
why
take
a
transcript
at
all,
why
do
you
record
it?
mr.
justic
marshall
except
that
if
a
person
is
wealthy
enough
he
can
pay
for
it.
mr.
justic
marshall
but
that
doesn't
help
the
petition
at
all.
mr.
justic
marshall
does
it
add
up
to
the
transcript
is
really
for
the
purpose
of
helping
the
wealthy
petitioner
and
the
state?
mr.
justic
marshall
failure,
that's
all.
mr.
justic
marshall
we
don't
have
the
state
here?
mr.
justic
marshall
we
only
have
the
state
here,
state
of
california.
mr.
justic
marshall
oh!
so
finally
he
had
sufficient
legal
advice,
there
is
no
way
the
federal
court
was
--
mr.
justic
marshall
well
i
guess
i'm
taking
it
too
far
field
but
to
me
it
looks
like
the
benefit
of
the
transcript
is
solely
for
the
state
and
of
course
is
able
to
pay
for
it.
doesn't
it?
mr.
justic
marshall
how
can
a
supreme
court
find
an
error
in
the
record
below
if

doesn't

mr.

mr.

and
if

doesn't

what
course
does
the
supreme

take?
mr.
justic
marshall
doesn't
have,
then
it
doesn't
have
an
independent

of
its

mr.
