justice
potter
stewart
mr.
solicitor
general,
one
of
my
difficulties
in
reading
the
briefs
and
advanced
argument
in
this
case
which
continues
now
is
that
you
and
your
adversary
don't
really
seem
to
argue
as
to
what
this
case
is
about.
is
that
fair
to
say?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i'm
not
referring
to
the
purchase
and
sale
difficulties.
i'm
talking
really
about
the
if
not
the
broad
question
to
which
you
are
now
addressing
yourself
and
you
are
quoting
to
us
some
very
broad
language
of
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
but
the
decision
was
not
part
of
the
district
court
as
affirm
by
the
court
of
appeals
simply
that
the
mccarran
act
foreclosed
the
undoing
of
a
merger
that
had
been
approved
by
the
arizona
commission.
that's
the
holding
in
these
cases,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
tell
me
why.
justice
potter
stewart
i
didn't
understand
the
district
court
or
the
court
of
appeals
really
to
have
held
that
the
neither
the
1933
act
or
the
1934
act
was
completely
inapplicable,
or
completely
inapplicable
to
the
dealings
and
securities
of
insurance
companies.
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
holding
of
that
case
was
that
that
company
was
engaging
in
selling
securities
not
insurance
policies.
suppose,
if
an
insurance
company
went
to
the
telephone
business,
they
have
to
pay
the
tax
on
telephones.
justice
potter
stewart
good
many
insurance
companies
particularly
life
insurance
companies
these
days
are
owned
not
by
stockholders
not
by
shareholders
but
are
owned
by
the
policyholders.
i
suppose
the
merger
of
two
mutual
companies
would
be
i
suppose
these
policyholders
as
owners
would
happen
there.
i
guess
there
specifically
_
on
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
except
i
believe
they
are
expressed
exemptions
in
the
securities
acts,
aren't
they?
justice
potter
stewart
there
may
be
i'm
not
sure
either.
