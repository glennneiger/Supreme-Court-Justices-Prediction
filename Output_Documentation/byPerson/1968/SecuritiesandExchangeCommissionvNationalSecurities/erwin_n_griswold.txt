mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
it
involves
the
construction
and
application
of
the
mccarran-ferguson
act
and
its
interrelation
with
section
10
(b)
of
the
securities
exchange
act
of
1934.
the
text
of
those
two
statutes
is
given
on
pages
33
and
34
of
the
government's
brief
and
this
case.
i
would
call
attention
to
the
provision
in
section
10
(b)
which
makes
it
unlawful
for
any
person
to
use
or
employ
any
connection
with
the
purchase
or
sale
of
any
security
registered
on
the
national
securities
exchange
or
any
security
not
so
registered.
the
net
result
of
those
two
phrases
is
simply
to
apply
to
any
security
any
fraudulent
device
as
defined
by
the
rules
of
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
and
the
relevant
rule
10b-5
is
set
out
at
the
bottom
of
page
34
and
on
page
35.
the
text
of
the
mccarran-ferguson
act
is
on
page
33
of
our
brief
and
the
relevant
portion
there
although
it's
all
relevant
but
the
part
that
comes
closest
is
section
2
(b),
no
act
of
congress
shall
be
construed
to
invalidate,
impair
or
supersede
any
law
enacted
by
any
state
for
the
purpose
of
regulating
the
business
of
insurance
or
which
imposes
a
fee
or
tax
upon
such
business
unless
such
acts
specifically
relates
to
the
business
of
insurance
and
i
would
suggest
that
the
keywords
in
that
provision
of
the
mccarran-ferguson
act
are
the
business
of
insurance.
the
present
case
began
in
march
1965
when
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
filed
its
petition
in
the
district
court
for
arizona.
it
sought
to
have
that
court
enjoin
the
respondent
here,
the
national
securities,
inc.
and
it
subsidiary
and
certain
officers
and
employees
from
violating
section
10
(b)
and
rule
10b-5
on
the
ground
of
asserted
fraud
in
connection
with
purchase
or
sale
of
securities.
in
due
course
the
defendants
filed
a
motion
for
judgment
on
the
pleadings
or
in
the
alternative
for
summary
judgment,
the
motion
for
judgment
on
the
pleadings
was
granted
by
the
district
court
and
this
was
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals.
as
the
court
of
appeals
stated
in
its
opinion
in
this
situation,
the
allegations
and
the
amended
complaint
must
be
presumed
to
be
true.
and
these
allegations
may
be
summarized
this
way.
it
is
alleged
that
the
respondent,
national
securities,
inc.
is
a
holding
company
which
owned
two-thirds
of
the
slightly
more
than
a
million
shares
outstanding
of
national
life
which
was
in
arizona
insurance
company.
producers
life
insurance
company
was
another
arizona
company.
it
had
some
881,000
outstanding
shares
held
by
approximately
14,000
stockholders
in
many
states.
in
other
words,
it
was
quite
widely
distributed.
the
allegation
is
that
the
defendants
formed
an
illegal
scheme
contrary
to
section
10
(b)
under
which
national
securities
would
acquire
control
of
producers
life,
national
life,
and
producers
life
would
be
consolidated
and
the
consolidated
company
would
pay
a
large
part
of
national
securities
cost
of
acquiring
control
of
producers
life.
in
carrying
out
the
scheme,
national
securities
purchased
the
stock
in
producers
which
was
held
by
four
of
producers'
directors
and
agreed
to
pay
them
a
very
large
sum
for
there
agreement
not
to
compete
with
producers
life
or
any
successor
company.
the
national
securities
also
purchased
from
producers
life
more
than
50,000
shares
of
its
treasury
stock
and
assumed
some
$600,000.00
of
liabilities
of
producers
life
arising
out
of
previous
agreements
which
had
been
made
with
other
persons
not
to
compete
with
it.
it
was
further
alleged
that
national
securities
did
not
disclose
to
producers
life
or
its
stockholders
that
it
intended
to
impose
both
of
this
liabilities
with
respect
to
agreements
not
to
compete
upon
the
corporation
which
would
result
from
the
plan
consolidation
of
producers
life
and
national
life.
after
obtaining
control,
the
producers
life
according
to
the
allegations
again,
national
securities
cause
the
latter
to
mail
to
its
stockholders
materials
soliciting
them
to
approve
the
propose
consolidation
with
national
life.
and
it
was
then
alleged
that
this
material
was
false
and
misleading
on
four
grounds:
(a)
that
it
did
not
disclose
the
liability
on
the
agreements
not
to
compete.
(b)
that
it
predicted
substantial
consolidated
earnings
without
disclosing
that
producers
life
and
national
life
had
each
had
losses
in
the
prior
year.
(c)
it
set
forth
on
the
pro
forma
balance
sheet
for
the
consolidated
company
and
asset
shown
as
treasury
stock
in
the
amount
of
more
than
a
million
dollars
that
was
alleged
to
be
illusory
and
finally
that
it
did
not
disclose
in
its
report
to
the
--
that
in
its
report
to
the
arizona
insurance
commission,
the
national
life
had
written
down
the
value
of
its
investment
in
producers
life
by
more
than
a
million
dollars.
the
court
allowed
the
defendants
to
submit
the
proposal
to
the
arizona
insurance
commission
and
to
the
stockholders.
both
approved
the
plan
and
that
was
carried
out.
it
was
then
that
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
filed
the
amended
complaint
which
is
now
before
the
court
seeking
such
relief
as
might
be
appropriate
under
the
circumstances.
in
its
answer
to
the
amended
complaint
and
in
its
motion
for
judgment
on
the
pleadings,
the
defendant
contended
that
the
district
court
has
no
jurisdiction
because
the
matters
complained
of
are
entirely
within
state
jurisdiction
as
provided
in
the
mccarran
act,
thus,
raising
the
issue
which
is
here.
the
district
court
accepted
this
contention
as
one
of
its
grounds
of
decision
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
district
court's
judgment
on
this
ground
alone.
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
in
rather
sweeping
terms.
the
relevant
portion
for
this
part
of
my
argument
appears
on
pages
156
and
157
of
the
appendix
near
the
bottom
of
page
156,
we
are
left
then
with
a
general
intention
to
set
the
insurance
business
outside
the
scope
of
all
existing
and
future
legislation
regulating
interstate
commerce
without
any
more
direct
evidence
that
congress
had
in
mind
in
the
securities
exchange
act.
however,
congress
was
apparently
seeking
to
define
an
exemption
for
insurance
and
then
the
word
is
conterminous
but
i
supposed
we
usually
say
co-terminus
with
its
power
to
regulate
interstate
commerce.
the
court
is
there
saying
that
with
respect
to
insurance
in
so
far
as
congress
would
have
power
to
regulate
any
aspect
of
it
under
its
commerce
power,
the
effect
of
the
mccarran
act
is
to
say
that
that
power
is
not
being
exercised.
and
over
on
page
157,
just
above
the
middle,
the
court
said
and
equally
vital
purpose
of
the
mccarran
act
was
to
preserve
intact
from
any
federal
intrusion
based
on
the
commerce
clause
existing
and
future
state
regulation
of
the
insurance
industry.
thus
the
sole
issue
is
here
whether
this
construction
of
the
mccarran-ferguson
act
and
determination
of
its
effect
are
correct.
or
whether
the
facts
alleged
are
sufficient
state
of
cause
of
action
under
section
10
(b)
of
the
securities
exchange
act
of
1934
despite
the
provisions
of
the
mccarran-ferguson
act
which
was
passed
in
1946.
i
will
now
turn
to
the
legal
questions
involved
in
the
case.
it
maybe
that
i
have
a
somewhat
narrow
alleged
stand
on
but
i
think
the
footing
is
firm.
when
section10
(b)
was
enacted
in
1934,
there
was
no
doubt
that
it
applied
to
fraud
and
the
purchase
and
sale
of
all
securities,
you'll
recall
the
phrase
in
the
statute
is
any
security
including
those
in
insurance
companies.
this
was
true
despite
the
fact
that
it
was
the
common
understanding
at
that
time
that
the
federal
government
had
no
power
to
regulate
“the
business
of
insurance.”
a
clear
distinction
was
evident
between
the
business
of
insurance
on
the
one
hand
and
securities
of
a
company
which
is
engaged
in
conducting
the
insurance
business.
in
1944,
the
south-eastern
underwriters
case
was
decided
followed
in
1946
part
of
the
enactment
of
the
mccarran-ferguson
act.
the
south-eastern
underwriters
case
undoubtedly
involved
the
conduct
of
the
business
of
insurance
the
way
in
which
insurance
companies
operate
together
in
fixing
their
rates
and
had
nothing
to
do
with
transactions
in
securities
of
an
insurance
company.
the
distinction
was
explicitly
made
in
the
mccarran-ferguson
act
itself
for
it
said
that
no
act
of
congress
should
supersede
any
law
enacted
by
any
state
for
the
purpose
of
regulating
the
business
of
insurance.
now
these
was
emphasized
in
the
report
of
the
house
committee
set
forth
on
page
24
of
our
brief
where
the
committee
said,
it
is
not
the
intention
of
congress
in
the
enactment
of
this
legislation
the
closest
states
with
any
power
to
regulate
or
tax
the
business
of
insurance
beyond
that
which
they
had
been
held
to
possess
prior
to
the
decision
of
the
united
states
supreme
court
in
the
south-eastern
underwriters
association
case.
in
short,
the
function
of
the
mccarran-ferguson
act
was
to
restore
the
status
quo
to
put
things
back
where
they
were
before
the
south-eastern
underwriters
case
was
decided
except
that
it
was
made
explicit
that
the
sherman
act,
the
clayton
act,
and
the
federal
trade
commission
act
should
apply
to
the
business
of
insurance
to
the
extent
that
such
business
is
not
regulated
by
state
law.
it
was
only
with
respect
to
these
three
statutes
that
there
is
any
indication
that
federal
law
should
apply
only
if
there
was
not
an
applicable
provision
in
state
law.
throughout
their
history,
both
before
and
after
the
enactment
of
the
mccarran-ferguson
act,
the
provisions
of
the
securities
law
relating
to
securities
and
the
security's
law
don't
relate
to
the
business
of
insurance.
the
provisions
of
the
securities
law
is
relating
to
securities
have
been
regarded
as
applicable
to
securities
and
insurance
companies.
we
have
listed
many
of
these
instances
in
the
footnotes
on
pages
16
and
17
of
our
brief.
thus,
issues
of
insurance
company
securities
have
been
registered
under
section
6
of
the
securities
act
of
1933.
securities
of
insurance
companies
listed
on
national
exchanges
have
been
registered
with
the
commission
under
section
12
of
the
securities
exchange
act
of
1934.
persons
who
buy
and
sell
insurance
company
securities
have
been
registered
under
sections
15
(b)
of
the
securities
exchange
act.
investment
companies
with
portfolios
consisting
of
insurance
company
securities
have
been
registered
under
section
8
of
the
investment
company
act
and
persons
selling
insurance
company
securities
and
a
fraudulent
manner
have
been
enjoined
and
convicted
in
a
considerable
number
of
cases.
the
decision
of
the
court
below
which
fails
to
recognize
the
distinction
between
the
business
of
insurance
to
which
the
mccarran-ferguson
act
applies
and
dealings
in
securities
which
happen
to
be
stocks
and
insurance
companies
would
sweep
all
these
away
and
broadly
exempt
all
dealings
and
insurance
securities
from
application
of
the
federal
laws.
this
is
the
effect
of
the
decision
below
where
the
court
said
congress
was
apparently
seeking
to
define
an
exemption
for
insurance
conterminous
with
its
power
to
regulate
interstate
commerce.
if
congress
was
intending
to
do
that,
obviously
it
swept
away
all
applications
of
the
insurance
--
of
the
securities
laws
to
dealings
and
insurance
securities.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
i
think
there
is
something
about
that.
mr.
frank
weighs
a
lot
of
other
questions
which
present
some
difficulties
which
were
not
decided
by
the
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
not
exactly
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
we
didn't
ask
for
the
undoing
of
the
merger
in
the
exclusively
as
our
only
relief
in
the
amended
complaint.
we
ask
for
such
relief
as
would
be
appropriated
under
the
circumstances
and
it
may
well
be
that
the
merger
should
be
left
merged.
but
that
individuals
who
have
profited
by
the
transaction
should
be
required
in
some
way
to
account
either
by
disgorging
to
the
merged
company
or
by
making
payments
to
the
shareholders
who
did
not
participate
from
it,
all
the
questions
of
relief
are
left
undecided
both
by
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
because
they
didn't
get
to
them
having
held
that
the
mccarran-ferguson
act
eliminated
the
whole
matter.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well
mr.
justice,
i
can't
read
that
language
on
page
157
or
the
court
of
appeals
in
any
other
way,
and
equally
by
it
on
purpose
of
the
mccarran
act
was
to
preserve
intact
from
any
federal
intrusion
based
on
the
commerce
clause
existing
and
future
state
regulation
of
the
insurance
industry.
and
that
would
apply
to
any
fraudulent
sale
of
insurance
stocks.
now
it
is
true
that
this
case
does
involve
a
merger
of
an
insurance
company
and
mr.
frank
argues
that
approving
a
merger
is
in
some
way
analogous
to
the
question
of
chartering
and
insurance
company.
i
find
it
difficult
even
with
that
is
fine
anything
in
the
mccarran-ferguson
act
which
says
that
when
this
is
done
in
a
fraudulent
way,
that
the
provisions
of
the
securities
and
exchange
act
are
superseded,
are
written
off,
are
in
effect
repealed.
i
pointed
out
that
the
practice
has
been
consistently
to
the
contrary.
both
before
the
mccarran-ferguson
act
was
passed
and
i
think
that
is
very
relevant
before
the
south-eastern
underwriters
case
was
decided.
it
was
then
regarded
as
the
appropriate
construction
of
the
securities
acts
that
they
were
applicable
to
transactions
of
purchases
and
sales
as
the
language
of
the
statute
with
respect
to
insurance
companies
as
to
any
other
securities
and
we
think
that
the
effect
of
the
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit
is
to
make
the
insurance
--
is
to
make
the
security
statutes
inapplicable
to
transactions
to
dealings,
to
actions
with
respect
to
securities
in
insurance
companies
and
it
is
our
contention
that
that
is
not
the
proper
construction
of
the
mccarran-ferguson
act
which
relates
to
the
business
of
insurance
to
the
things
done
by
insurance
companies
with
respect
to
their
policyholders
but
not
to
transactions
done
by
other
persons
with
respect
to
securities
in
insurance
companies.
there
are
obviously
other
federal
statutes
of
general
application
which
were
applicable
to
insurance
before
the
mccarran-ferguson
act
was
passed
and
which
continued
to
be
applicable
to
insurance
thereafter.
this
includes
the
copyright
and
patent
laws
and
insurance
company
is
not
exempt
from
the
telephone
tax
or
the
social
security
tax.
it's
not
free
to
issue
counterfeit
money
if
it
doesn't
have
enough
to
meet
its
legitimate
claims.
it's
subject
to
the
postal
laws
including
those
making
at
a
crime
to
use
the
mails
for
the
purposes
of
fraud.
and
i
would
point
out
that
section
10
(b)
is
based
on
the
postal
laws
as
well
as
on
interstate
commerce
and
that
the
mails
were
so
used.
and
that
there
are
a
sizeable
number
of
prosecutions
both
before
and
after
the
mccarran-ferguson
act
for
using
the
mails
to
defraud
with
respect
to
the
sale
of
insurance
securities.
these
matters
are
not
referred
to
in
the
mccarran-ferguson
act
but
it
cannot
be
supposed
that
congress
contemplated
any
change
in
the
law
with
respect
to
them.
as
i've
said,
we're
dealing
here
with
the
statute
which
is
based
in
part
on
the
postal
power.
there's
no
reason
to
think
that
congress
in
passing
the
mccarran-ferguson
act
intended
to
allow
an
insurance
company
to
use
the
mails
to
defraud
stockholders.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
at
this
particular
time,
there
was
no
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
federal
provision
with
respect
to
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
federal
law
would
govern
to
the
extent
that
the
fraud
was
proved
and
found
by
the
court.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice.
it
is
our
view
that
that's
just
what
congress
did
do
in
1933
and
1934,
that
it
passed
a
law
regulating
transactions
of
purchase
and
sale
of
any
security
and
that
that
included
securities
in
insurance
companies
and
was
so
construed
by
the
commission
and
in
a
very
few
cases
by
the
courts
between
1933,
1934,
and
1944
when
the
south-eastern
underwriters
case
was
decided.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice
that's
exactly
the
argument
we
do
make
that
congress
had
this
power
and
exercise
it
before
1944
and
that
for
that
reason,
the
enactment
of
the
mccarran-ferguson
act
which
was
intended
to
restore
the
status
quo
did
not
and
was
not
intended
to
take
away
the
effect
of
the
statute
which
congress
had
previously
passed
with
respect
to
securities.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no
cases
in
this
court.
certainly,
there
was
a
modestly
considerable
amount
of
practical
experience
in
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
including
registration
of
securities
and
things
of
that
sort.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
never
had
been
challenged
on
that
ground
that
i'm
aware
of.
now,
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice,
i
think
you
stated
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
you
stated
the
issue
and
very
clearly
and
very
precisely.
there
is
of
course
some
overlap
here.
i
think
a
considerable
part
of
our
concern
is
with
the
sweeping
nature
of
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
which
says
that
the
mccarran-ferguson
act
wiped
out
completely
all
aspects
of
the
securities
regulation
with
respect
to
insurance.
when
you
come
to
the
question
of
a
merger,
i
think
it
is
a
nice
question
as
to
what
is
meant
by
the
business
of
insurance
and
i
think
an
argument
can
be
made
which
is
the
one
we
stand
on
that
the
business
of
insurance
relates
to
the
internal
operations
of
insurance
and
not
to
dealings
in
securities
which
congress
has
so
clearly
taken
over
for
a
federal
authority.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
dealing
with
the
security
holders
we
would
contend
is
not
“the
business
of
insurance”
as
was
meant
by
congress
when
it
used
those
words
in
the
mccarran-ferguson
act.
let
me
--
there
is
one
decision
of
this
court
which
is
pretty
close
in
many
ways
which
is
the
united
benefit
life
insurance
company
case
decided
only
a
short
while
ago.
there
the
company
was
undoubtedly
an
insurance
company
and
the
decision
of
the
court
that
it
could
not
sell
variable
annuity
policies
without
registering
them
with
the
sec
is
directly
that
the
securities
of
an
insurance
company
are
subject
to
the
securities
laws
and
are
not
taken
out
of
the
provisions
of
the
securities
laws
by
the
mccarran-ferguson
act.
in
that
case
the
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice
that
would
be
applicable
to
the
variable
annuity
life
insurance
company
which
sold
nothing
but
variable
annuities.
but
the
united
benefit
life
insurance
company
was
undoubtedly
an
insurance
company.
it
sold
large
quantities
of
what
everybody
would
agree
was
insurance.
it
also
sought
to
sell
variable
annuities.
and
this
court
held
that
it
couldn't
do
it
without
registering
them
with
the
sec
and
that
it
seems
to
me
is
inevitably
a
direct
decision
that
the
securities
of
an
insurance
company
are
subject
to
the
registration
provisions
of
the
securities
laws
despite
the
fact
that
congress
has
passed
the
mccarran-ferguson
act
or
to
put
it
in
other
way
that
dealings
in
the
securities
of
an
insurance
company
are
not
“the
business
of
insurance”
within
in
the
mccarran-ferguson
act.
that
there
are
other
cases
which
are
close
but
i
think
that
the
united
benefit
case
comes
very
close
to
supporting
our
position.
the
decision
of
the
court
below
would
wipe
out
every
application
of
the
securities
laws
to
securities
and
insurance
companies.
this
is
contrary
to
the
long
continued
understanding
in
this
area.
it's
not
required
by
the
language
of
the
mccarran-ferguson
act
and
it's
inconsistent
with
that
act's
purposes.
accordingly,
the
judgment
below
should
be
reversed
and
the
case
remanded
for
consideration
there
of
the
other
questions
involved
in
the
case.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
we
would
have
to
find
something
mr.
justice
if
we
constitute
securities
in
such
companies
before
section
10
(b)
would
apply
because
it
applies
only
to
purchases
and
sales
of
any
security.
now,
conceivably
in
a
mutual
company,
you
could
say
that
the
policyholders
are
security
holders
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
with
respect
to
mutual
companies?
there
may
be,
i'm
not
sure.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
it
involves
the
construction
and
application
of
the
mccarran-ferguson
act
and
its
interrelation
with
section
10
(b)
of
the
securities
exchange
act
of
1934.
the
text
of
those
two
statutes
is
given
on
pages
33
and
34
of
the
government's
brief
and
this
case.
i
would
call
attention
to
the
provision
in
section
10
(b)
which
makes
it
unlawful
for
any
person
to
use
or
employ
any
connection
with
the
purchase
or
sale
of
any
security
registered
on
the
national
securities
exchange
or
any
security
not
so
registered.
the
net
result
of
those
two
phrases
is
simply
to
apply
to
any
security
any
fraudulent
device
as
defined
by
the
rules
of
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
and
the
relevant
rule
10b-5
is
set
out
at
the
bottom
of
page
34
and
on
page
35.
the
text
of
the
mccarran-ferguson
act
is
on
page
33
of
our
brief
and
the
relevant
portion
there
although
it's
all
relevant
but
the
part
that
comes
closest
is
section
2
(b),
no
act
of
congress
shall
be
construed
to
invalidate,
impair
or
supersede
any
law
enacted
by
any
state
for
the
purpose
of
regulating
the
business
of
insurance
or
which
imposes
a
fee
or
tax
upon
such
business
unless
such
acts
specifically
relates
to
the
business
of
insurance
and
i
would
suggest
that
the
keywords
in
that
provision
of
the
mccarran-ferguson
act
are
the
business
of
insurance.
the
present
case
began
in
march
1965
when
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
filed
its
petition
in
the
district
court
for
arizona.
it
sought
to
have
that
court
enjoin
the
respondent
here,
the
national
securities,
inc.
and
it
subsidiary
and
certain
officers
and
employees
from
violating
section
10
(b)
and
rule
10b-5
on
the
ground
of
asserted
fraud
in
connection
with
purchase
or
sale
of
securities.
in
due
course
the
defendants
filed
a
motion
for
judgment
on
the
pleadings
or
in
the
alternative
for
summary
judgment,
the
motion
for
judgment
on
the
pleadings
was
granted
by
the
district
court
and
this
was
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals.
as
the
court
of
appeals
stated
in
its
opinion
in
this
situation,
the
allegations
and
the
amended
complaint
must
be
presumed
to
be
true.
and
these
allegations
may
be
summarized
this
way.
it
is
alleged
that
the
respondent,
national
securities,
inc.
is
a
holding
company
which
owned
two-thirds
of
the
slightly
more
than
a
million
shares
outstanding
of
national
life
which
was
in
arizona
insurance
company.
producers
life
insurance
company
was
another
arizona
company.
it
had
some
881,000
outstanding
shares
held
by
approximately
14,000
stockholders
in
many
states.
in
other
words,
it
was
quite
widely
distributed.
the
allegation
is
that
the
defendants
formed
an
illegal
scheme
contrary
to
section
10
(b)
under
which
national
securities
would
acquire
control
of
producers
life,
national
life,
and
producers
life
would
be
consolidated
and
the
consolidated
company
would
pay
a
large
part
of
national
securities
cost
of
acquiring
control
of
producers
life.
in
carrying
out
the
scheme,
national
securities
purchased
the
stock
in
producers
which
was
held
by
four
of
producers'
directors
and
agreed
to
pay
them
a
very
large
sum
for
there
agreement
not
to
compete
with
producers
life
or
any
successor
company.
the
national
securities
also
purchased
from
producers
life
more
than
50,000
shares
of
its
treasury
stock
and
assumed
some
$600,000.00
of
liabilities
of
producers
life
arising
out
of
previous
agreements
which
had
been
made
with
other
persons
not
to
compete
with
it.
it
was
further
alleged
that
national
securities
did
not
disclose
to
producers
life
or
its
stockholders
that
it
intended
to
impose
both
of
this
liabilities
with
respect
to
agreements
not
to
compete
upon
the
corporation
which
would
result
from
the
plan
consolidation
of
producers
life
and
national
life.
after
obtaining
control,
the
producers
life
according
to
the
allegations
again,
national
securities
cause
the
latter
to
mail
to
its
stockholders
materials
soliciting
them
to
approve
the
propose
consolidation
with
national
life.
and
it
was
then
alleged
that
this
material
was
false
and
misleading
on
four
grounds:
(a)
that
it
did
not
disclose
the
liability
on
the
agreements
not
to
compete.
(b)
that
it
predicted
substantial
consolidated
earnings
without
disclosing
that
producers
life
and
national
life
had
each
had
losses
in
the
prior
year.
(c)
it
set
forth
on
the
pro
forma
balance
sheet
for
the
consolidated
company
and
asset
shown
as
treasury
stock
in
the
amount
of
more
than
a
million
dollars
that
was
alleged
to
be
illusory
and
finally
that
it
did
not
disclose
in
its
report
to
the
--
that
in
its
report
to
the
arizona
insurance
commission,
the
national
life
had
written
down
the
value
of
its
investment
in
producers
life
by
more
than
a
million
dollars.
the
court
allowed
the
defendants
to
submit
the
proposal
to
the
arizona
insurance
commission
and
to
the
stockholders.
both
approved
the
plan
and
that
was
carried
out.
it
was
then
that
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
filed
the
amended
complaint
which
is
now
before
the
court
seeking
such
relief
as
might
be
appropriate
under
the
circumstances.
in
its
answer
to
the
amended
complaint
and
in
its
motion
for
judgment
on
the
pleadings,
the
defendant
contended
that
the
district
court
has
no
jurisdiction
because
the
matters
complained
of
are
entirely
within
state
jurisdiction
as
provided
in
the
mccarran
act,
thus,
raising
the
issue
which
is
here.
the
district
court
accepted
this
contention
as
one
of
its
grounds
of
decision
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
district
court's
judgment
on
this
ground
alone.
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
in
rather
sweeping
terms.
the
relevant
portion
for
this
part
of
my
argument
appears
on
pages
156
and
157
of
the
appendix
near
the
bottom
of
page
156,
we
are
left
then
with
a
general
intention
to
set
the
insurance
business
outside
the
scope
of
all
existing
and
future
legislation
regulating
interstate
commerce
without
any
more
direct
evidence
that
congress
had
in
mind
in
the
securities
exchange
act.
however,
congress
was
apparently
seeking
to
define
an
exemption
for
insurance
and
then
the
word
is
conterminous
but
i
supposed
we
usually
say
co-terminus
with
its
power
to
regulate
interstate
commerce.
the
court
is
there
saying
that
with
respect
to
insurance
in
so
far
as
congress
would
have
power
to
regulate
any
aspect
of
it
under
its
commerce
power,
the
effect
of
the
mccarran
act
is
to
say
that
that
power
is
not
being
exercised.
and
over
on
page
157,
just
above
the
middle,
the
court
said
and
equally
vital
purpose
of
the
mccarran
act
was
to
preserve
intact
from
any
federal
intrusion
based
on
the
commerce
clause
existing
and
future
state
regulation
of
the
insurance
industry.
thus
the
sole
issue
is
here
whether
this
construction
of
the
mccarran-ferguson
act
and
determination
of
its
effect
are
correct.
or
whether
the
facts
alleged
are
sufficient
state
of
cause
of
action
under
section
10
(b)
of
the
securities
exchange
act
of
1934
despite
the
provisions
of
the
mccarran-ferguson
act
which
was
passed
in
1946.
i
will
now
turn
to
the
legal
questions
involved
in
the
case.
it
maybe
that
i
have
a
somewhat
narrow
alleged
stand
on
but
i
think
the
footing
is
firm.
when
section10
(b)
was
enacted
in
1934,
there
was
no
doubt
that
it
applied
to
fraud
and
the
purchase
and
sale
of
all
securities,
you'll
recall
the
phrase
in
the
statute
is
any
security
including
those
in
insurance
companies.
this
was
true
despite
the
fact
that
it
was
the
common
understanding
at
that
time
that
the
federal
government
had
no
power
to
regulate
“the
business
of
insurance.”
a
clear
distinction
was
evident
between
the
business
of
insurance
on
the
one
hand
and
securities
of
a
company
which
is
engaged
in
conducting
the
insurance
business.
in
1944,
the
south-eastern
underwriters
case
was
decided
followed
in
1946
part
of
the
enactment
of
the
mccarran-ferguson
act.
the
south-eastern
underwriters
case
undoubtedly
involved
the
conduct
of
the
business
of
insurance
the
way
in
which
insurance
companies
operate
together
in
fixing
their
rates
and
had
nothing
to
do
with
transactions
in
securities
of
an
insurance
company.
the
distinction
was
explicitly
made
in
the
mccarran-ferguson
act
itself
for
it
said
that
no
act
of
congress
should
supersede
any
law
enacted
by
any
state
for
the
purpose
of
regulating
the
business
of
insurance.
now
these
was
emphasized
in
the
report
of
the
house
committee
set
forth
on
page
24
of
our
brief
where
the
committee
said,
it
is
not
the
intention
of
congress
in
the
enactment
of
this
legislation
the
closest
states
with
any
power
to
regulate
or
tax
the
business
of
insurance
beyond
that
which
they
had
been
held
to
possess
prior
to
the
decision
of
the
united
states
supreme
court
in
the
south-eastern
underwriters
association
case.
in
short,
the
function
of
the
mccarran-ferguson
act
was
to
restore
the
status
quo
to
put
things
back
where
they
were
before
the
south-eastern
underwriters
case
was
decided
except
that
it
was
made
explicit
that
the
sherman
act,
the
clayton
act,
and
the
federal
trade
commission
act
should
apply
to
the
business
of
insurance
to
the
extent
that
such
business
is
not
regulated
by
state
law.
it
was
only
with
respect
to
these
three
statutes
that
there
is
any
indication
that
federal
law
should
apply
only
if
there
was
not
an
applicable
provision
in
state
law.
throughout
their
history,
both
before
and
after
the
enactment
of
the
mccarran-ferguson
act,
the
provisions
of
the
securities
law
relating
to
securities
and
the
security's
law
don't
relate
to
the
business
of
insurance.
the
provisions
of
the
securities
law
is
relating
to
securities
have
been
regarded
as
applicable
to
securities
and
insurance
companies.
we
have
listed
many
of
these
instances
in
the
footnotes
on
pages
16
and
17
of
our
brief.
thus,
issues
of
insurance
company
securities
have
been
registered
under
section
6
of
the
securities
act
of
1933.
securities
of
insurance
companies
listed
on
national
exchanges
have
been
registered
with
the
commission
under
section
12
of
the
securities
exchange
act
of
1934.
persons
who
buy
and
sell
insurance
company
securities
have
been
registered
under
sections
15
(b)
of
the
securities
exchange
act.
investment
companies
with
portfolios
consisting
of
insurance
company
securities
have
been
registered
under
section
8
of
the
investment
company
act
and
persons
selling
insurance
company
securities
and
a
fraudulent
manner
have
been
enjoined
and
convicted
in
a
considerable
number
of
cases.
the
decision
of
the
court
below
which
fails
to
recognize
the
distinction
between
the
business
of
insurance
to
which
the
mccarran-ferguson
act
applies
and
dealings
in
securities
which
happen
to
be
stocks
and
insurance
companies
would
sweep
all
these
away
and
broadly
exempt
all
dealings
and
insurance
securities
from
application
of
the
federal
laws.
this
is
the
effect
of
the
decision
below
where
the
court
said
congress
was
apparently
seeking
to
define
an
exemption
for
insurance
conterminous
with
its
power
to
regulate
interstate
commerce.
if
congress
was
intending
to
do
that,
obviously
it
swept
away
all
applications
of
the
insurance
--
of
the
securities
laws
to
dealings
and
insurance
securities.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
i
think
there
is
something
about
that.
mr.
frank
weighs
a
lot
of
other
questions
which
present
some
difficulties
which
were
not
decided
by
the
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
not
exactly
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
we
didn't
ask
for
the
undoing
of
the
merger
in
the
exclusively
as
our
only
relief
in
the
amended
complaint.
we
ask
for
such
relief
as
would
be
appropriated
under
the
circumstances
and
it
may
well
be
that
the
merger
should
be
left
merged.
but
that
individuals
who
have
profited
by
the
transaction
should
be
required
in
some
way
to
account
either
by
disgorging
to
the
merged
company
or
by
making
payments
to
the
shareholders
who
did
not
participate
from
it,
all
the
questions
of
relief
are
left
undecided
both
by
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
because
they
didn't
get
to
them
having
held
that
the
mccarran-ferguson
act
eliminated
the
whole
matter.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well
mr.
justice,
i
can't
read
that
language
on
page
157
or
the
court
of
appeals
in
any
other
way,
and
equally
by
it
on
purpose
of
the
mccarran
act
was
to
preserve
intact
from
any
federal
intrusion
based
on
the
commerce
clause
existing
and
future
state
regulation
of
the
insurance
industry.
and
that
would
apply
to
any
fraudulent
sale
of
insurance
stocks.
now
it
is
true
that
this
case
does
involve
a
merger
of
an
insurance
company
and
mr.
frank
argues
that
approving
a
merger
is
in
some
way
analogous
to
the
question
of
chartering
and
insurance
company.
i
find
it
difficult
even
with
that
is
fine
anything
in
the
mccarran-ferguson
act
which
says
that
when
this
is
done
in
a
fraudulent
way,
that
the
provisions
of
the
securities
and
exchange
act
are
superseded,
are
written
off,
are
in
effect
repealed.
i
pointed
out
that
the
practice
has
been
consistently
to
the
contrary.
both
before
the
mccarran-ferguson
act
was
passed
and
i
think
that
is
very
relevant
before
the
south-eastern
underwriters
case
was
decided.
it
was
then
regarded
as
the
appropriate
construction
of
the
securities
acts
that
they
were
applicable
to
transactions
of
purchases
and
sales
as
the
language
of
the
statute
with
respect
to
insurance
companies
as
to
any
other
securities
and
we
think
that
the
effect
of
the
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit
is
to
make
the
insurance
--
is
to
make
the
security
statutes
inapplicable
to
transactions
to
dealings,
to
actions
with
respect
to
securities
in
insurance
companies
and
it
is
our
contention
that
that
is
not
the
proper
construction
of
the
mccarran-ferguson
act
which
relates
to
the
business
of
insurance
to
the
things
done
by
insurance
companies
with
respect
to
their
policyholders
but
not
to
transactions
done
by
other
persons
with
respect
to
securities
in
insurance
companies.
there
are
obviously
other
federal
statutes
of
general
application
which
were
applicable
to
insurance
before
the
mccarran-ferguson
act
was
passed
and
which
continued
to
be
applicable
to
insurance
thereafter.
this
includes
the
copyright
and
patent
laws
and
insurance
company
is
not
exempt
from
the
telephone
tax
or
the
social
security
tax.
it's
not
free
to
issue
counterfeit
money
if
it
doesn't
have
enough
to
meet
its
legitimate
claims.
it's
subject
to
the
postal
laws
including
those
making
at
a
crime
to
use
the
mails
for
the
purposes
of
fraud.
and
i
would
point
out
that
section
10
(b)
is
based
on
the
postal
laws
as
well
as
on
interstate
commerce
and
that
the
mails
were
so
used.
and
that
there
are
a
sizeable
number
of
prosecutions
both
before
and
after
the
mccarran-ferguson
act
for
using
the
mails
to
defraud
with
respect
to
the
sale
of
insurance
securities.
these
matters
are
not
referred
to
in
the
mccarran-ferguson
act
but
it
cannot
be
supposed
that
congress
contemplated
any
change
in
the
law
with
respect
to
them.
as
i've
said,
we're
dealing
here
with
the
statute
which
is
based
in
part
on
the
postal
power.
there's
no
reason
to
think
that
congress
in
passing
the
mccarran-ferguson
act
intended
to
allow
an
insurance
company
to
use
the
mails
to
defraud
stockholders.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
at
this
particular
time,
there
was
no
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
federal
provision
with
respect
to
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
federal
law
would
govern
to
the
extent
that
the
fraud
was
proved
and
found
by
the
court.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice.
it
is
our
view
that
that's
just
what
congress
did
do
in
1933
and
1934,
that
it
passed
a
law
regulating
transactions
of
purchase
and
sale
of
any
security
and
that
that
included
securities
in
insurance
companies
and
was
so
construed
by
the
commission
and
in
a
very
few
cases
by
the
courts
between
1933,
1934,
and
1944
when
the
south-eastern
underwriters
case
was
decided.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice
that's
exactly
the
argument
we
do
make
that
congress
had
this
power
and
exercise
it
before
1944
and
that
for
that
reason,
the
enactment
of
the
mccarran-ferguson
act
which
was
intended
to
restore
the
status
quo
did
not
and
was
not
intended
to
take
away
the
effect
of
the
statute
which
congress
had
previously
passed
with
respect
to
securities.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no
cases
in
this
court.
certainly,
there
was
a
modestly
considerable
amount
of
practical
experience
in
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
including
registration
of
securities
and
things
of
that
sort.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
never
had
been
challenged
on
that
ground
that
i'm
aware
of.
now,
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice,
i
think
you
stated
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
you
stated
the
issue
and
very
clearly
and
very
precisely.
there
is
of
course
some
overlap
here.
i
think
a
considerable
part
of
our
concern
is
with
the
sweeping
nature
of
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
which
says
that
the
mccarran-ferguson
act
wiped
out
completely
all
aspects
of
the
securities
regulation
with
respect
to
insurance.
when
you
come
to
the
question
of
a
merger,
i
think
it
is
a
nice
question
as
to
what
is
meant
by
the
business
of
insurance
and
i
think
an
argument
can
be
made
which
is
the
one
we
stand
on
that
the
business
of
insurance
relates
to
the
internal
operations
of
insurance
and
not
to
dealings
in
securities
which
congress
has
so
clearly
taken
over
for
a
federal
authority.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
dealing
with
the
security
holders
we
would
contend
is
not
“the
business
of
insurance”
as
was
meant
by
congress
when
it
used
those
words
in
the
mccarran-ferguson
act.
let
me
--
there
is
one
decision
of
this
court
which
is
pretty
close
in
many
ways
which
is
the
united
benefit
life
insurance
company
case
decided
only
a
short
while
ago.
there
the
company
was
undoubtedly
an
insurance
company
and
the
decision
of
the
court
that
it
could
not
sell
variable
annuity
policies
without
registering
them
with
the
sec
is
directly
that
the
securities
of
an
insurance
company
are
subject
to
the
securities
laws
and
are
not
taken
out
of
the
provisions
of
the
securities
laws
by
the
mccarran-ferguson
act.
in
that
case
the
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice
that
would
be
applicable
to
the
variable
annuity
life
insurance
company
which
sold
nothing
but
variable
annuities.
but
the
united
benefit
life
insurance
company
was
undoubtedly
an
insurance
company.
it
sold
large
quantities
of
what
everybody
would
agree
was
insurance.
it
also
sought
to
sell
variable
annuities.
and
this
court
held
that
it
couldn't
do
it
without
registering
them
with
the
sec
and
that
it
seems
to
me
is
inevitably
a
direct
decision
that
the
securities
of
an
insurance
company
are
subject
to
the
registration
provisions
of
the
securities
laws
despite
the
fact
that
congress
has
passed
the
mccarran-ferguson
act
or
to
put
it
in
other
way
that
dealings
in
the
securities
of
an
insurance
company
are
not
“the
business
of
insurance”
within
in
the
mccarran-ferguson
act.
that
there
are
other
cases
which
are
close
but
i
think
that
the
united
benefit
case
comes
very
close
to
supporting
our
position.
the
decision
of
the
court
below
would
wipe
out
every
application
of
the
securities
laws
to
securities
and
insurance
companies.
this
is
contrary
to
the
long
continued
understanding
in
this
area.
it's
not
required
by
the
language
of
the
mccarran-ferguson
act
and
it's
inconsistent
with
that
act's
purposes.
accordingly,
the
judgment
below
should
be
reversed
and
the
case
remanded
for
consideration
there
of
the
other
questions
involved
in
the
case.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
we
would
have
to
find
something
mr.
justice
if
we
constitute
securities
in
such
companies
before
section
10
(b)
would
apply
because
it
applies
only
to
purchases
and
sales
of
any
security.
now,
conceivably
in
a
mutual
company,
you
could
say
that
the
policyholders
are
security
holders
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
with
respect
to
mutual
companies?
there
may
be,
i'm
not
sure.
