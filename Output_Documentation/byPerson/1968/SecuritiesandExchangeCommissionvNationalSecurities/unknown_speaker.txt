unknown
speaker
where
is
that
in
the
record?
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
frank.
unknown
speaker
i
mistakenly
don’t
reach
that
if
we
agree
with
the
ninth
circuit
about
the
mccarran
act
point,
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
so
when
you
say,
when
you’re
urging
us
to
consider
them
all.
unknown
speaker
well
you
say
your
urging
us
to
consider
them
all.
unknown
speaker
of
course
only
if
we
decided
against
you
on
mccarran
act
wouldn’t
that
be?
unknown
speaker
you’re
not
confessing
judgment
on
the
mccarran
act
point?
unknown
speaker
mr.
frank,
may
i
ask
you,
one
question.
suppose
a
stockholder
of
one
of
the
merging
companies
when
in
the
federal
court
on
the
basis
of
diversity
of
federal
law
and
brought
an
action
for
injunctions,
suppose
he
prove
that
material
misrepresentations
or
fraud
--
fraudulent
statements
and
representations
had
occur
in
the
solicitation
of
the
exchange
of
securities.
as
a
technical
matter,
would
that
be
a
basis
for
the
grant
of
injunctive
relief?
unknown
speaker
you
spoke,
yes,
i
understand
that
but
you
spoke
earlier
about
the
sec
enjoining
the
merger
of
what
has
happened
is
that
the
sec
has
resorted
to
a
court
and
has
said
that
there
is
a
violation
of
a
provision
of
federal
law
that
prohibits
the
use
of
manipulative
or
deceptive
devices
in
connection
with
the
sale
or
exchange
of
a
security.
now
forgetting
all
your
other
points,
the
sec
is
going
in
there
as
a
litigant.
and
it
is
asserting
a
point
of
law
based
upon
a
specific
provision
in
the
federal
act.
now
you
have
to
take
it
that
your
first
task
is
to
persuade
as
that
that
is
a
regulation
of
the
business
of
insurance.
and
therefore
the
mccarran
act
applies,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
suppose
in
the
consummation
of
this
merger
there
had
been
a
violation
of
the
postal
laws.
you’re
not
suggesting
that
the
mccarran
act
would
preclude
criminal
prosecution
under
the
postal
laws?
unknown
speaker
what
you’re
saying
is
that
the
remedy
sought
here,
the
remedy
rather
than
the
cause
of
action
is
precluded
by
the
mccarran
act,
is
that
it?
in
other
words
or
let’s
take
it
another
way,
mr.
frank.
let’s
suppose
that
the
sec
through
the
department
of
justice
started
a
criminal
prosecution
against
the
company
or
against
the
company
and
some
of
its
employees
for
fraud
committed
in
effecting
this
merger.
you
would
not
argue
that
that’s
precluded
by
the
mccarran
act,
would
you?
unknown
speaker
take
this
precise
situation.
are
you
saying
or
are
you
not
that
the
mccarran
act
would
preclude
a
criminal
prosecution
or
a
fraud
in
connection
with
the
exchange
of
securities
and
this
merger
which
fraud
was
by
my
hypothesis
a
violation
of
the
criminal
statute,
its
federal
criminal
statutes
and
would
you
say
that
the
mccarran
act
precludes
that?
unknown
speaker
they
said
it?
unknown
speaker
i
don’t
think
it
takes
you
by
surprise,
mr.
frank
but
the
problem
point
that
i’m
trying
to
which
i’m
asking
you
to
address
yourself
because
it
seems
a
little
inevitably
involved
in
this
case.
you
objected
to
the
solicitor
general’s
argument
because
you
said
it’s
too
broad
and
that
there
is
an
area
which
is
not
foreclosed
by
the
mccarran
act.
well,
i
suggest
to
you
that
perhaps
i
dare
you
include
on
the
base
of
sided
cases,
criminal
prosecution
and
the
federal
statute
for
fraud
in
connection
with
sale
of
securities.
unknown
speaker
and
what
you’re
--
so
that
what
you’re
objecting
to
here,
what
you’re
saying
here
as
i
follow
your
argument
may
be
that
the
mccarran
act
precludes
the
remedy
here.
what
the
sec
seeks
--
unknown
speaker
following
the
course
rather
than
the
application
of
10
(b)
5
and
if
i’m
wrong
i
want
you
to
tell
me.
unknown
speaker
how
about
now?
unknown
speaker
well
what
--
alright,
what
about
then
if
arizona
then
had
some
rules
where
you’re
applying
the
proxies
and
the
sec
had
some
rules
applying
the
proxies
and
under
the
federal
law
that
those
statement
was
there.
under
the
state
law
it
was
good.
unknown
speaker
was
--so
your
answer
--
your
answer
is
there
is
there
is
really
a
conflict
between
there
and
if
there
was
a
conflict
then
between
arizona
and
the
federal
law,
arizona
law
would
control?
unknown
speaker
let's
assume
there
was.
assume
there
was.
unknown
speaker
that
arizona
would
control?
unknown
speaker
which
i
think
is
certainly
part
of
the
government’s
point
here
that
it’s
the
securities
laws
are
going
to
apply
at
all
here.
they
--
certainly
they
should
be
able
to
apply
the
extent
of
being
able
to
save
and
to
enjoin
it
and
to
enjoin
the
use
of
a
proxy
statement
which
violates
the
federal
law.
unknown
speaker
even
if
under
arizona
law
that
proxy
statement
is
good.
unknown
speaker
mr.
frank,
the
1964
amendments
don’t
apply
to
this
case,
do
they?
unknown
speaker
right.
now,
second,
it’s
been
--
it
was
my
understanding
that
this
1964
amendments
which
became
effective
in
1966.
applied
or
intended
so
far
as
irrelevant
to
displace
the
federal
act
by
the
state,
by
appropriate
state
acts
only
with
respect
to
regulatory
provisions
and
not
to
displace
the
manipulate
or
entire
manipulation
on
antifraud
provisions
such
as
10
(b)
5.
unknown
speaker
do
you
disagree
with
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
yes,
whether
you
have
to
break
the
maybe,
what
i’m
suggesting
to
you
is
that
you
have
to
break
that
down
now.
that
is
to
say
that
there
is,
there
are
regulatory
provisions
and
their
entire
fraud
provisions.
and
the
question
in
this
case
seems
to
me
at
the
moment
anyway
is
whether
and
--
whether
the
mccarran
act
was
intended
to
displace
the
antifraud
provisions.
number
one,
certainly
it
doesn’t
displace
postal
act.
and
number
two,
does
the
mccarran
act
have
an
effect
or
have
some
impact
upon
the
relief
that
the
sec
can
obtain
in
court
with
respect
to
merger
which
has
been
approved
by
state
commissioners.
unknown
speaker
where
is
that
in
the
record?
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
frank.
unknown
speaker
i
mistakenly
don’t
reach
that
if
we
agree
with
the
ninth
circuit
about
the
mccarran
act
point,
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
so
when
you
say,
when
you’re
urging
us
to
consider
them
all.
unknown
speaker
well
you
say
your
urging
us
to
consider
them
all.
unknown
speaker
of
course
only
if
we
decided
against
you
on
mccarran
act
wouldn’t
that
be?
unknown
speaker
you’re
not
confessing
judgment
on
the
mccarran
act
point?
unknown
speaker
mr.

may
i
ask
