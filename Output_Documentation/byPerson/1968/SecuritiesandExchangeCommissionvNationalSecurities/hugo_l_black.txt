oh!
there
had
been
no
northeast
--
southeastern
case?
none
at
all?
is
it
your
belief
that
under
the
law
there's
a
then
existent
congress
could
have
passed
bill
regulating
this
very
thing
under
the
commerce
clause?
justice

l.
black
i
asked
you
that
question
because
i
have
been
under
the
impression
having
some
little
addresses
in
south-eastern
underwriters
case
that
was
the
purpose
of
congress
to
do
away
and
time
they
would
expect
so
long
as
relying
on
the
commerce
clause's
concern
and
in
insurance
business,
i
admit
that
i
agree
with
that,
and
would
you
not
have
to
if
that
was
the
case.
would
you
not
have
to
show
that
even
without
that
will,
if
that
case
had
never
been
decided
would
not
change
the
rule.
that
congress
could
have
and
would
have
passed
this
act.

cases

it
had
not

challenged
on
that
ground?
