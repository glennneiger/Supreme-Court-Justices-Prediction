mr.
john
p.
frank
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
john
p.
frank
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
we
heard
the
solicitor
general
yesterday
expressed
his
concern
that
the
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit
in
this
matter
has
somehow
exempted
all
securities
and
securities
transactions
of
insurance
companies
from
regulation
under
the
applicable
securities
act.
it
is
our
belief
and
our
argument
to
you
that
the
government
gives
this
case
an
overbreadth
that
the
solicitor
general
may
not
be
so
concerned
over
the
extreme
range
which
he
reads
in
the
opinion
which
in
our
view
is
not
truly
there.
may
we
make
perfectly
clear
that
we
have
never
--
i’ve
been
on
this
case
for
over
four
years
and
presented
all
of
its
arguments
with
my
partners
here,
we
have
never
doubted
the
general
powers
of
the
sec
over
insurance
company
securities
nor
suggested
making
of
the
sort
nor
have
the
opinions.
we
have
no
doubt
at
all
that
the
registration
of
a
public
offering
of
an
insurance
company
is
required
by
law.
indeed,
these
very
briefs
give
citations
of
the
manners
in
which
this
very
company
has
had
its
public
offering
subject
to
registration.
we
have
no
doubt
that
the
insider
disclosure
provisions
in
connection
with
purchaser
sale
of
company
securities
apply
fully
to
insurance
companies.
we
have
no
doubt
that
all
of
the
regulations
as
to
the
daily
trading
by
insurance
companies
are
fully
applicable
or
that
registration
under
the
investment
company
act
of
1940
as
well
as
the
1933
act
in
connection
with
the
sale
of
variable
annuities
is
required.
it
is
our
view
that
this
is
a
decision
which
was
accurately
described
by,
let’s
take
an
independent
reader,
judge
harlan’s
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york
recently
had
occasion
to
apply
this
ninth
circuit
case
in
a
wholly
different
manner.
and
he
says,
speaking
of
this
case
in
that
case,
the
one
we’re
talking
about,
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
sought
to
invalidate
the
merger
of
two
stock
life
insurance
companies
on
the
ground
that
the
antifraud
provisions
of
the
securities
exchange
act
of
1934
were
violated.
what
national
securities
this
case
held
was
that
the
federal
statute
did
not
govern
because
it
impaired
a
detailed
state
regulatory
scheme
specifically
and
directly
aimed
at
the
business
of
insurance.
now
let
me
give
you
briefly
the
account
as
we
see
it
of
what
happened
and
what
the
issue
is
and
how
it
comes
here.
what
it
happened
was
that
in
late
19
or
in
the
year
1964,
an
arizona
company
national
life
was
largely
owned
by
another
concerned
national
securities.
national
securities
people
bought
in
on
a
second
arizona
company.
it
bought
stock
in
a
company
called
producers
life.
and
late
in
the
year
1964,
a
merger
proposal
was
made
to
merge
these
two
companies.
now
let
me
say
a
word
about
the
arizona
laws
to
insurance
company
mergers,
what
happens
just
as
under
our
statutes
is
that
first
there
must
be
approval
by
the
directors
of
the
two
companies.
then
the
matter
is
put
up
to
shareholder
vote
in
each
company.
thereafter,
if
it
is
approved
by
the
shareholders,
the
matter
then
goes
to
the
director
of
insurance
and
he
must
review
the
legality
of
the
proposal
and
specifically
under
our
code
must
consider
it
from
the
standpoint
of
general
legality
under
our
laws
and
in
terms
of
the
interest
of
shareholders
specifically
as
well
as
the
policyholders,
and
the
merger
becomes
effective
on
his
approval.
now,
what
happened
was
this.
the
directors
did
approve.
the
matter
went
to
the
national
shareholders
they
approved
without
question.
the
matter
then
went
to
the
producer
shareholders
and
there,
there
was
a
considerable
contest.
and
there
was
a
minority
group
which
filed
lawsuits
and
contested
and
there
was
ripsnorting
good
proxy
fight
to
determine
how
those
shareholders
would
vote
on
the
question
of
this
merger.
thereupon,
the
sec
early
in
1965
filed
this
action.
and
the
action
which
was
filed
was
filed
exclusively
under
section
10
(b)
of
the
1934
act.
and
under
rule
10b-5
which
i
will
be
speaking
about
principally
and
the
action
at
that
time
i
should
mention
and
this
point
may
be
important
in
view
of
what
the
solicitor
general
said
yesterday.
the
action
was
brought
against
our
clients,
the
people
who
were
promoting
the
merger.
but
it
was
also
brought
against
the
original
sellers,
the
people
from
whom
we
have
bought.
the
so-called
selling
directors
and
i
asked
that
that
be
held
in
mind
for
just
a
moment.
the
action
was
brought
but
the
thrust
of
the
action
as
brought
was
that
it
was
to
enjoin
the
merger
and
to
the
shareholders
meeting
and
to
enjoin
letting
the
matter
be
presented
to
the
arizona
director
of
insurance.
now,
what
happened
was
that
an
ex
parte
order
was
issued
which
we
have
no
notice
that
is
to
say
which
did
restrain
these
things.
and
thereupon,
we
filed
the
usual
motions.
and
the
matter
came
on
before
federal
district
judge
mathes
and
at
that
point,
the
court
dismissed
as
to
the
selling
directors.
and
the
selling
directors
are
not
in
the
case.
they’re
not
in
the
case
now
in
any
way
and
there
has
never
been
an
appeal
from
the
order
in
that
respect.
and
the
matter
which
was
turned
was
simply
the
question
of
whether
our
clients
could
be
enjoined
from
going
forward
with
this
merger
and
specifically
could
be
enjoin
from
presenting
the
matter
that
the
shareholders
whose
meeting
was
in
suspense
waiting
for
the
order
of
the
court
as
to
whether
they
can
vote
on
the
merger
whether
they
could.
now
in
those
circumstances,
the
essence
of
the
complaint
as
made
by
the
sec
as
fairly
summarize
in
the
government’s
brief
was
that
there
was
objection
to
four
elements
of
the
proxy
solicitation
which
had
been
going
forward
in
connection
with
this
merger
in
connection
with
the
shareholders
meeting.
and
there
were,
as
i
said
there
had
been
minority
shareholders
suit
and
you
can
see
from
the
record
that
the
matter
came
on
and
the
crowded
courtroom
before
judge
mathes
with
the
minority
shareholders
present,
the
sec
present
and
judge
mathes
said
“no,
i
believe
that
this
is
a
matter
as
to
whether
this
merger
can
go
forward
which
properly
has
to
be
taken
up
with
the
director
of
insurance
in
this
state.”
if
the
shareholders
approved
of
it
then
judge
mathes
turned
to
us.
we
asked
that
you
stipulate
that
there
will
be
a
fair
period
of
time
and
that
you’ll
give
notice
to
the
sec
so
that
the
sec
can
present
to
the
arizona
insurance
commissioner
any
facts
which
it
regards
as
relevant
or
important
in
connection
with
this
merger.
and
he
broadly
admonished
the
shareholders
present
if
any
of
them
are
dissatisfied
and
the
sec
that
they
should
take
their
problem
to
the
arizona
director
of
insurance.
thereupon,
he
vacated
substantially
all
of
the
term
of
the
operative
portions
of
the
temporary
restraining
order.
and
at
that
point,
the
matter
did
come
on
before
the
stockholders
who
overwhelmingly
approved
the
proposed
merger.
and
the
matter
went
over
to
the
arizona
director
of
insurance.
and
at
that
point
we
did
as
we
have
agreed
we
would
serve
notice
on
the
sec
that
it
was
being
presented
to
the
director
of
insurance.
and
the
sec
thereupon
presented
to
the
director
of
insurance
all
of
the
papers
that
are
in
this
case,
its
pleadings,
its
affidavits,
and
all
other
matters.
and
sent
them
down
with
the
suggestion
that
director
of
insurance
should
take
these
things
into
account
in
deciding
whether
to
permit
the
merger
or
not.
thereupon,
after
a
reasonable
period,
of
time,
the
arizona
insurance
director
did
approve
the
merger.
and
at
that
point,
the
commission
which
had
sought
no
stay
there
had
not
gone
to
other
circuit
had
not
come
here,
thereupon
amended
its
complaint.
i
got
leave
to
amend
and
did
amend.
and
it
then
presented
and
amended
complaint
and
in
the
light
of
the
comments
of
the
solicitor
general,
i
think
that
perhaps
would
be
worthy
of
noting
that
the
amended
complaint
and
its
operative
portions
of
course
contained
in
the
appendix
and
all
i
wish
to
say
is
that
what
the
amended
complaint
asked
for
was
that
the
merger
be
nullified.
mr.
john
p.
frank
that
is
at
page
99,
mr.
justice.
and
you’ll
see
there
that
what
they
asked
at
the
top
of
the
page
was
that,
no
steps
be
taken
toward
the
merger
while
the
merger
was
already
done.
that
it
become
obsolete.
the
next
paragraph
is
that
the
merger
should
be
nullified
and
that
the
whole
thing
should
be
set
aside.
then
in
the
remaining
paragraph,
there
is
a
passage
which
relates
to
the
original
contract
of
purchase
but
that
was
of
no
consequence
because
that
was
directed
at
our
clients
and
their
actions
and
the
actions
of
the
selling
directors.
but
the
selling
directors
weren’t
parties.
the
sec
moved
to
rejoin
them
as
parties
but
that
motion
was
denied
and
they
never
appealed
it.
and
what
they
asked
for
in
the
remainder
was
in
effect
steps
which
would
further
nullify
the
merger
and
undo
the
action
that
was
taken.
now,
really
the
precise
question
which
is
here
is
not
some
broad
issue
about
the
relationship
of
the
securities
laws
in
the
insurance
industry.
what
is
before
this
court,
what
has
been
before
the
parks
below
is
simply
this
question.
does
rule
10
(b)
5
give
the
sec
power
to
stop
or
reverse
a
merger
of
insurance
companies
on
the
ground
of
asserted
misleading
proxy
solicitations.
and
we
say
the
answer
to
that
question
is
no.
and
we
say
no
on
three
independent
grounds.
anyone
of
which
is
sufficient
for
the
purpose.
we
say
no
first
of
all
on
the
ground
that
the
mccarran
act
in
the
light
of
the
arizona
statute
bars
this
intervention
by
federal
court
and
by
the
sec
and
the
ninth
circuit
and
the
district
court
took
that
point
of
view.
second,
we
say
as
a
wholly
independent
ground
that
the
whole
thrust
of
what
the
sec
was
seeking
to
do
is
here
is
to
enjoin
the
merger
or
set
it
aside
on
the
ground
of
some
alleged
improprieties
to
the
proxies.
but
they
bring
this
action
under
section
10
under
rule
10
(b)
5.
and
section
10
and
rule
10
(b)
5
don’t
deal
with
proxies.
there’s
a
wholly
different
section.
a
section
14
which
does
deal
with
proxies.
and
this
is
important
because
that
i’m
going
to
develop
it
in
a
moment.
the
proxy
rules
and
provisions
did
not
apply
to
this
particular
insurance
company
at
this
time
at
all.
that
would
not
take
effect
until
the
year
1966
and
more
than
that.
congress
had
expressly
provided
that
by
a
different
act
which
was
not
mentioned
yesterday
but
which
is
discussed
in
the
briefs
into
which
i’ll
come
back
has
expressly
provided
that
insurance
company
proxy
solicitations
are
to
be
subject
to
state
control.
and
the
ninth
circuit
in
general
took
our
position
on
that
point.
then
there
was
a
third
ground
which
we
advanced
and
i’d
like
to
have
that
clearly
in
focus.
rule
10
(b)
5
applies
only
to
the
purchased
and
sale
of
securities
and
if
therefore
there
wasn’t
any
purchase
or
sale
then
there
is
no
scope,
no
place
of
operation
for
the
rule.
and
the
real
question
in
the
case
therefore
at
the
lower
court
stage
was
whether
a
so
called
statutory
merger
was
a
sale
of
securities
at
all,
and
hence,
whether
it
was
within
the
scoped
of
the
statute
in
this
rule.
and
as
i
will
develop
in
just
a
moment
when
mr.
justice
douglas
was
at
the
commission,
when
justice
fortas
was
at
the
commission,
the
commission
took
the
view
that
a
statutory
merger
was
not
a
purchase
or
sale
and
the
ninth
circuit
had
expressly
so
held
on
the
basis
of
a
recommendation
of
the
commission.
and
so
on,
and
in
more
recent
years
the
commission
has
reversed
itself,
and
abandon
that
position.
and
now
seems
to
extend
rule
10
(b)
5
to
mergers.
so
one
of
the
questions
what
the
sec
said
in
the
ninth
circuit
was
the
most
important
question
in
the
case
was
whether
the
ninth
circuit
would
overrule
its
earlier
opinion
on
this
point.
the
ninth
circuit
did
not
need
to
decide
that
particular
question
having
decided
the
mccarran
act
question.
now,
one
problem
which
is
before
this
court
is,
how
many
of
these
independent
grounds
will
it
consider?
and
we
respectfully
submit
that
it
should
consider
them
all.
the
government
says
no,
it
should
not
consider
the
rule
10
(b)
5
or
this
purchase
on
sale
problem
because
it
was
not
expressly
decided
by
the
ninth
circuit
citing
to
an
opinion
of
justice
white
which
typically
holds
that
where
there
are
complex
factual
issues,
which
were
not
considered
at
the
circuit,
then
this
court
may
in
its
discretion
remand
to
permit
those
complex
factual
questions
to
be
considered
rather
than
consider
them
here.
but
the
purchase
and
sale
problem
is
not
accomplished
factual
question.
it
is
a
pure
question
of
law.
there
is
no
factual
record.
the
matter
went
off
on
affidavits
and
a
motion.
and
we
submit
therefore
that
in
your
discretion
this
is
an
independent
ground
for
decision
which
it
may
properly
consider.
mr.
john
p.
frank
yes.
mr.
john
p.
frank
your
honor,
these
are
truly
independent
and
then
you
can
rest
it
on
any
of
them
but
the
most
obvious
thing
to
do
--
mr.
john
p.
frank
the
most
obvious
thing
to
do
--
mr.
john
p.
frank
only
if
you
--
mr.
john
p.
frank
that
is
right.
and
your
honor,
let
me
now
address
myself
to
the
proposition.
such
a
misfortune
should
not
occur.
mr.
john
p.
frank
we
are
not
your
honor.
though
i
must
say
that
if
i
thought
that
this
opinion
was
as
broad
as
the
sg,
solicitor
general
has
had,
i
would
confess
there,
we
have
never
made
any
contention
of
this
broad
scale
sort
has
been
the
concern
of
the
government.
mr.
john
p.
frank
your
honor,
it
might
very
possibly
be
the
basis
for
a
grant
of
injunctive
relief
if
he
went
in
on
diversity
grounds
and
not
under
rule
10
(b)
you’re
claiming
under
the
statute
and
that
is
exactly
what
happened,
your
honor.
mr.
john
p.
frank
that’s
right
your
honor.
and
we,
in
other
words
have
this
been
a
diversity
action
based
on
state
law
then
none
of
these
problems
would
be
here.
we
had
such
a
thing.
we
did
litigate
it,
it
was
disposed
of.
our
problem
now
is
whether
the
rule
and
i’ll
turn
directly
to
your
point
under
the
mccarran
act
reaches
can
be
allowed
to
reach
a
statutory
merger
of
insurance
companies.
mr.
john
p.
frank
your
--
mr.
john
p.
frank
your
honor,
it
would
depend
upon
whether
there
was
a
state
law
dealing
truly
and
effectively
with
the
very
same
subject.
mr.
john
p.
frank
your
honor,
i
could
--
i
would
have
to
answer
that
i
believe
that
the
answer
is
no
because
the
state
of
arizona
has
no
direct
or
equivalent
criminal
law
dealing
with
that
exact
subject.
mr.
john
p.
frank
the
test
and
the
reason
i
put
it
in
alternative
fashion,
your
honor
is
that
your
question
takes
me
by
surprise
and
i
would
have
to
look
back
to
the
code
criminal
provisions
to
be
absolutely
certain.
mr.
john
p.
frank
and
mr.
justice
there
is
the
case
which
probably
is
in
your
mind.
at
least
it’s
well
known
to
circuit
court
cases.
the
case
of
salvanas
from
the
seventh
circuit.
salvanas
holds
that
a
postal
--
mr.
john
p.
frank
your
honor,
--
mr.
john
p.
frank
alright.
and
your
answer,
we
do
say
that
this
is
wrong.
this
basis
that
the
pleadings
here
taken
as
a
whole
if
you
read
the
whole
complaint
and
the
whole
amended
complaint.
taking
the
complaint
and
the
documentation
and
the
remedy
portions
altogether
are
solely
and
exclusively
directed
to
the
object
of
offsetting
an
arizona
insurance
company
merger
and
that
we
say
cannot
be
done
under
the
mccarran
act
whether
you
call
it
a
cause
of
action
or
a
remedy
or
a
merger
of
the
two
of
them.
and
this
is
because
mr.
justice
we
have
a
very
express
code.
our
code
provisions
are
set
forth
in
our
own
brief
if
perhaps
you
had
a
chance
to
look
at
them
earlier
but
as
you
will
see,
we
have
page
49
gives
the
provision
express
language
right
in
the
heart
of
our
insurance
code.
as
to
what
is
the
function
of
the
insurance
department
and
connection
with
a
merger
of
insurance
companies
and
against
this
must
be
balance
the
fact
that
the
mccarran
act
expressly
says
that
no
state
law
shall
be
allowed
to
invalidate,
impair,
or
supersede,
i’m
sorry,
that
no
federal
law
will
be
allowed
to
invalidate,
impair
or
supersede
a
state
law
which
deals
with
the
business
of
insurance.
and
i
have
put
this
question
to
the
government
and
i
put
it
again,
and
i
put
it
with
the
utmost
urgency.
i
cannot
concede
of
how
it
would
be
possible
more
totally
to
supersede
the
arizona
code
20-731.
and
to
sustain
a
position
of
the
sec
in
this
action
because
the
entire
method
that
they
are
saying
is
that
there
shall
be
no
merger
in
the
entire
method
that
the
state
is
saying
under
this
provision
is
that
there
shall
be
a
merger.
now
the
government
in
its
brief,
impression
arises
is
the
merger
and
thus
the
existence
of
an
insurance
company
to
be
regarded
as
part
of
the
business
of
insurance.
the
government
in
its
brief
says
expressly
at
page
17,
historically
such
matter
as
the
chartering
and
licensing
of
insurance
companies
are
matters
for
the
state.
that
is
exactly
what
we
are
dealing
with
here.
the
question
which
was
presented
to
the
arizona
insurance
director
was
whether
the
merge
of
these
insurance
companies
was
to
be
allowed
to
give
birth
of
what
is
for
all
practical
functioning
purposes
a
new
insurance
company.
mr.
john
p.
frank
your
honor,
may
i
answer
that
in
terms
of
how
it
was
done
and
how
it
is
now.
mr.
john
p.
frank
at
the
present
time,
there
is
comprehensive
regulation
because
your
honor,
in
1964,
congress
passed
what
are
known
as
the
1964
amendments
of
which
i
assume
you’re
familiar.
those
amendments
expressly
provided
that
the
states
should
have
proxy
control
and
insurance
companies
if
they
would
adopt
regulations
of
the
national
association
of
insurance
commissions.
and
the
state
of
arizona,
like
all
the
other
50
--
the
other
49
states
have
adopted
some
regulations.
so
that
we
now
have
a
compressive
regulatory
code
over
proxies,
at
the
time
however,
--
mr.
john
p.
frank
that
is
right.
it
is
now
clear
that
proxy
rules
of
the
commission
do
not
apply
and
that
brings
me
to
the
other
aspect
of
the
matter
mr.
justice
white.
the
situation
is
that
congress
has
expressly
by
the
clear
language
of
the
1964
act.
expressly
and
precisely
provided
that
the
proxy
rules
of
the
sec
should
not
apply
to
the
insurance
companies.
mr.
john
p.
frank
that
is
the
whole
point,
your
honor.
frankly,
we
suggest
it
originally.
i
make
bold
to
suggest
now
that
this
is
a
case
in
which
the
certiorari
has
been
improvidently
granted
because
this
is
the
last,
conceivable
case
in
the
united
states
in
which
this
question
could
possibly
come
up.
because
now,
all
of
the
states
have
full
scale
proxy
regulations
but
your
honor,
i
want
to
make
clear
that
we
have
had
a
good
long
a
subject
then
because
arizona
had
adopted
what
is
called
a
little
mccarran
act
earlier
and
we
had
it
as
statutes
expressly
said
in
order
to
comply
and
me
to
require
the
mccarran
act
and
so
on.
and
this
included
numerous
though
less
comprehensive
restrictions
which
would
relate
to
illegalities
as
to
any
financial
statements.
mr.
john
p.
frank
and
the
answer
your
honor
is
this.
that
the
mccarran
act,
this
i
think
is
the
most
fundamental
single
error
mr.
justice
that
we
believe
the
government
makes.
the
government
takes
the
position
in
its
brief
that
there
must
have
been
no
errors
on
the
law
in
point
because
it
disagreed
with
the
commission.
as
for
the
consequences
of
these
particular
statements,
our
position
is
to
the
contrary,
your
honor.
your
decisions
under
the
mccarran
act
do
not
provide,
do
not
require
that
the
state
must
automatically
agree
with
the
federal
government.
under
your
decisions,
it
is
sufficient.
mr.
john
p.
frank
the
conflict
was
not
in
the
law
so
much
as
in
its
application,
mr.
justice.
mr.
john
p.
frank
yes,
our
position
is
--
mr.
john
p.
frank
our
position
would
be
that
the
arizona
law
would
control
as
to
the
weight
to
be
given
to
the
significance
of
one
of
the
proxy
statements.
mr.
john
p.
frank
your
honor,
yes
and
i’d
like
to
--
mr.
john
p.
frank
that
is
correct
and
the
whole
point
we
make
is
your
honor,
what
your
cases
have
said
repeatedly
is
that
the
states
need
not
simply
automatically
echo
or
rubberstamp
the
government.
it
is
enough
if
there
is
legislation
which
fairly
is
directed
to
the
same
general
matters.
let
me
be
precise
about
this.
in
this
instance,
there
is
for
example
as
the
problem
whether
a
given
financial
fact
was
not
disclose
but
it
is
possible
to
argue
that
the
fact
was
adequately
disclose
on
some
other
page
of
some
other
document.
now
that
kind
of
a
determination
has
to
be
made
by
somebody
and
our
point
is
that
it
is
a
decision
which
could
be
made
by
the
arizona
director.
these
are
none
of
the
great
mammoth
points
of
departure.
they
are
simply
questions
of
who
is
going
to
determine
what
weight
is
to
be
attached
to
one
detail
or
another.
mr.
john
p.
frank
no,
they
do
not
your
honor.
mr.
john
p.
frank
well
--
mr.
john
p.
frank
your
honor,
i
simply
approach
it
differently.
and
it
is
our
position
that
what
was
intended
if
i
may
meet
that
very
squarely,
what
was
intended
at
least
was
to
determine
whether
proxy
solicitations
in
connection
with
mergers
would
or
would
not
be
subject
to
federal
state
law.
and
--
mr.
john
p.
frank
yes.
mr.
chief
justice,
i’d
like
to
--
i
see
my
time
is
--
mr.
john
p.
frank
may
i
take
a
moment
or
two
to
wind
up.
mr.
justice
fortas,
all
i
can
say
is
that
if
that
was
the
commission’s
point
of
view
now,
it
was
not
the
commission’s
point
of
view
when
it
presented
the
1964
act
to
congress.
because
in
the
1964
hearings,
they
went
in
and
they
said,
we
need
this
legislation
for
the
purpose
of
controlling.
proxy
solicitations
in
connection
with
mergers
and
they
expressly
said
so.
and
at
no
point
did
they
say
now
we
already
have
this
power
in
some
respects.
or
we
have
it
for
regulatory
purposes.
we
have
it
for
any
purpose
rather
they
went
to
congress
saying
that
they
needed
this
power.
and
now
in
this
case
they
tell
us
that
they
had
it
all
the
time.
i
have
not,
i’d
like
if
i
may
to
mention,
only
to
wined
up
mr.
chief
justice
because
my
time
is
done.
i
bring
to
your
attention
expressly
that
congress
has
repeatedly
had
before
it
the
question
of
whether
it
ought
to
take
hold
of
insurance
mergers
and
has
decided
to
the
contrary.
we
quote
a
report
of
the
senate
judiciary
committee
in
which
that
committee
expressly
takes
up
the
subject
to
mergers
and
says,
“this
is
clearly
an
area
where
amendments
to
the
mccarran
act
may
be
needed.”
but
none
such
have
been
passed.
i
will
not
have
the
opportunity
of
discussing
with
you
your
honors,
the
sale
problem
because
of
the
expiration
of
time.
but
i
commend
that
to
your
consideration
in
the
briefs
which
we
have
presented
to
you.
i
repeat,
when
mr.
justice
douglas
and
mr.
justice
fortas
were
with
the
commission,
their
position
was
that
these
provisions
of
law
did
not
apply
to
mergers
at
all.
it
is
our
position
that
if
it
is
to
be
applied
to
mergers
such
it
certainly
not
be
retroactive
as
against
the
company
such
as
ours
which
could
not
possibly
reasonably
been
expected
to
know
that
that
was
the
law
when
it
faced
these
problems,
i
would
leave
the
matter,
your
honors
with
simply
these
questions.
how
could
the
sec
more
totally
supersede
our
law
by
doing
what
is
it
doing
here
and
the
answer
is,
i
think
it
would
be
impossible.
it
runs
a
snowplow
straight
to
it.
the
real
question
is
who
has
the
power
to
decide
whether
two
insurance
companies
may
merge
or
not
the
most
fundamental
conceivable
question
in
the
business
of
insurance.
but
with
special
attention
to
the
mattes
which
justice
fortas
has
raised.
why
did
the
sec
tell
congress
in
1964
that
it
needed
the
proxy
amendment
to
reach
mergers
it
already
have
that
power?
and
finally,
i
think
the
most
serious
question
of
all
under
the
mccarran
act.
why
did
congress,
and
this
relates
to
the
colloquy
with
justice
white,
why
did
congress
expressly
provide
in
the
1964
act
that
insurance
proxy
solicitation
should
be
under
state
control
if
intended
insurance
proxy
solicitations
to
be
under
federal
control.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
john
p.
frank
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
john
p.
frank
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
we
heard
the
solicitor
general
yesterday
expressed
his
concern
that
the
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit
in
this
matter
has
somehow
exempted
all
securities
and
securities
transactions
of
insurance
companies
from
regulation
under
the
applicable
securities
act.
it
is
our
belief
and
our
argument
to
you
that
the
government
gives
this
case
an
overbreadth
that
the
solicitor
general
may
not
be
so
concerned
over
the
extreme
range
which
he
reads
in
the
opinion
which
in
our
view
is
not
truly
there.
may
we
make
perfectly
clear
that
we
have
never
--
i’ve
been
on
this
case
for
over
four
years
and
presented
all
of
its
arguments
with
my
partners
here,
we
have
never
doubted
the
general
powers
of
the
sec
over
insurance
company
securities
nor
suggested
making
of
the
sort
nor
have
the
opinions.
we
have
no
doubt
at
all
that
the
registration
of
a
public
offering
of
an
insurance
company
is
required
by
law.
indeed,
these
very
briefs
give
citations
of
the
manners
in
which
this
very
company
has
had
its
public
offering
subject
to
registration.
we
have
no
doubt
that
the
insider
disclosure
provisions
in
connection
with
purchaser
sale
of
company
securities
apply
fully
to
insurance
companies.
we
have
no
doubt
that
all
of
the
regulations
as
to
the
daily
trading
by
insurance
companies
are
fully
applicable
or
that
registration
under
the
investment
company
act
of
1940
as
well
as
the
1933
act
in
connection
with
the
sale
of
variable
annuities
is
required.
it
is
our
view
that
this
is
a
decision
which
was
accurately
described
by,
let’s
take
an
independent
reader,
judge
harlan’s
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york
recently
had
occasion
to
apply
this
ninth
circuit
case
in
a
wholly
different
manner.
and
he
says,
speaking
of
this
case
in
that
case,
the
one
we’re
talking
about,
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
sought
to
invalidate
the
merger
of
two
stock
life
insurance
companies
on
the
ground
that
the
antifraud
provisions
of
the
securities
exchange
act
of
1934
were
violated.
what
national
securities
this
case
held
was
that
the
federal
statute
did
not
govern
because
it
impaired
a
detailed
state
regulatory
scheme
specifically
and
directly
aimed
at
the
business
of
insurance.
now
let
me
give
you
briefly
the
account
as
we
see
it
of
what
happened
and
what
the
issue
is
and
how
it
comes
here.
what
it
happened
was
that
in
late
19
or
in
the
year
1964,
an
arizona
company
national
life
was
largely
owned
by
another
concerned
national
securities.
national
securities
people
bought
in
on
a
second
arizona
company.
it
bought
stock
in
a
company
called
producers
life.
and
late
in
the
year
1964,
a
merger
proposal
was
made
to
merge
these
two
companies.
now
let
me
say
a
word
about
the
arizona
laws
to
insurance
company
mergers,
what
happens
just
as
under
our
statutes
is
that
first
there
must
be
approval
by
the
directors
of
the
two
companies.
then
the
matter
is
put
up
to
shareholder
vote
in
each
company.
thereafter,
if
it
is
approved
by
the
shareholders,
the
matter
then
goes
to
the
director
of
insurance
and
he
must
review
the
legality
of
the
proposal
and
specifically
under
our
code
must
consider
it
from
the
standpoint
of
general
legality
under
our
laws
and
in
terms
of
the
interest
of
shareholders
specifically
as
well
as
the
policyholders,
and
the
merger
becomes
effective
on
his
approval.
now,
what
happened
was
this.
the
directors
did
approve.
the
matter
went
to
the
national
shareholders
they
approved
without
question.
the
matter
then
went
to
the
producer
shareholders
and
there,
there
was
a
considerable
contest.
and
there
was
a
minority
group
which
filed
lawsuits
and
contested
and
there
was
ripsnorting
good
proxy
fight
to
determine
how
those
shareholders
would
vote
on
the
question
of
this
merger.
thereupon,
the
sec
early
in
1965
filed
this
action.
and
the
action
which
was
filed
was
filed
exclusively
under
section
10
(b)
of
the
1934
act.
and
under
rule
10b-5
which
i
will
be
speaking
about
principally
and
the
action
at
that
time
i
should
mention
and
this
point
may
be
important
in
view
of
what
the
solicitor
general
said
yesterday.
the
action
was
brought
against
our
clients,
the
people
who
were
promoting
the
merger.
but
it
was
also
brought
against
the
original
sellers,
the
people
from
whom
we
have
bought.
the
so-called
selling
directors
and
i
asked
that
that
be
held
in
mind
for
just
a
moment.
the
action
was
brought
but
the
thrust
of
the
action
as
brought
was
that
it
was
to
enjoin
the
merger
and
to
the
shareholders
meeting
and
to
enjoin
letting
the
matter
be
presented
to
the
arizona
director
of
insurance.
now,
what
happened
was
that
an
ex
parte
order
was
issued
which
we
have
no
notice
that
is
to
say
which
did
restrain
these
things.
and
thereupon,
we
filed
the
usual
motions.
and
the
matter
came
on
before
federal
district
judge
mathes
and
at
that
point,
the
court
dismissed
as
to
the
selling
directors.
and
the
selling
directors
are
not
in
the
case.
they’re
not
in
the
case
now
in
any
way
and
there
has
never
been
an
appeal
from
the
order
in
that
respect.
and
the
matter
which
was
turned
was
simply
the
question
of
whether
our
clients
could
be
enjoined
from
going
forward
with
this
merger
and
specifically
could
be
enjoin
from
presenting
the
matter
that
the
shareholders
whose
meeting
was
in
suspense
waiting
for
the
order
of
the
court
as
to
whether
they
can
vote
on
the
merger
whether
they
could.
now
in
those
circumstances,
the
essence
of
the
complaint
as
made
by
the
sec
as
fairly
summarize
in
the
government’s
brief
was
that
there
was
objection
to
four
elements
of
the
proxy
solicitation
which
had
been
going
forward
in
connection
with
this
merger
in
connection
with
the
shareholders
meeting.
and
there
were,
as
i
said
there
had
been
minority
shareholders
suit
and
you
can
see
from
the
record
that
the
matter
came
on
and
the
crowded
courtroom
before
judge
mathes
with
the
minority
shareholders
present,
the
sec
present
and
judge
mathes
said
“no,
i
believe
that
this
is
a
matter
as
to
whether
this
merger
can
go
forward
which
properly
has
to
be
taken
up
with
the
director
of
insurance
in
this
state.”
if
the
shareholders
approved
of
it
then
judge
mathes
turned
to
us.
we
asked
that
you
stipulate
that
there
will
be
a
fair
period
of
time
and
that
you’ll
give
notice
to
the
sec
so
that
the
sec
can
present
to
the
arizona
insurance
commissioner
any
facts
which
it
regards
as
relevant
or
important
in
connection
with
this
merger.
and
he
broadly
admonished
the
shareholders
present
if
any
of
them
are
dissatisfied
and
the
sec
that
they
should
take
their
problem
to
the
arizona
director
of
insurance.
thereupon,
he
vacated
substantially
all
of
the
term
of
the
operative
portions
of
the
temporary
restraining
order.
and
at
that
point,
the
matter
did
come
on
before
the
stockholders
who
overwhelmingly
approved
the
proposed
merger.
and
the
matter
went
over
to
the
arizona
director
of
insurance.
and
at
that
point
we
did
as
we
have
agreed
we
would
serve
notice
on
the
sec
that
it
was
being
presented
to
the
director
of
insurance.
and
the
sec
thereupon
presented
to
the
director
of
insurance
all
of
the
papers
that
are
in
this
case,
its
pleadings,
its
affidavits,
and
all
other
matters.
and
sent
them
down
with
the
suggestion
that
director
of
insurance
should
take
these
things
into
account
in
deciding
whether
to
permit
the
merger
or
not.
thereupon,
after
a
reasonable
period,
of
time,
the
arizona
insurance
director
did
approve
the
merger.
and
at
that
point,
the
commission
which
had
sought
no
stay
there
had
not
gone
to
other
circuit
had
not
come
here,
thereupon
amended
its
complaint.
i
got
leave
to
amend
and
did
amend.
and
it
then
presented
and
amended
complaint
and
in
the
light
of
the
comments
of
the
solicitor
general,
i
think
that
perhaps
would
be
worthy
of
noting
that
the
amended
complaint
and
its
operative
portions
of
course
contained
in
the
appendix
and
all
i
wish
to
say
is
that
what
the
amended
complaint
asked
for
was
that
the
merger
be
nullified.
mr.
john
p.
frank
that
is
at
page
99,
mr.
justice.
and
you’ll
see
there
that
what
they
asked
at
the
top
of
the
page
was
that,
no
steps
be
taken
toward
the
merger
while
the
merger
was
already
done.
that
it
become
obsolete.
the
next
paragraph
is
that
the
merger
should
be
nullified
and
that
the
whole
thing
should
be
set
aside.
then
in
the
remaining
paragraph,
there
is
a
passage
which
relates
to
the
original
contract
of
purchase
but
that
was
of
no
consequence
because
that
was
directed
at
our
clients
and
their
actions
and
the
actions
of
the
selling
directors.
but
the
selling
directors
weren’t
parties.
the
sec
moved
to
rejoin
them
as
parties
but
that
motion
was
denied
and
they
never
appealed
it.
and
what
they
asked
for
in
the
remainder
was
in
effect
steps
which
would
further
nullify
the
merger
and
undo
the
action
that
was
taken.
now,
really
the
precise
question
which
is
here
is
not
some
broad
issue
about
the
relationship
of
the
securities
laws
in
the
insurance
industry.
what
is
before
this
court,
what
has
been
before
the
parks
below
is
simply
this
question.
does
rule
10
(b)
5
give
the
sec
power
to
stop
or
reverse
a
merger
of
insurance
companies
on
the
ground
of
asserted
misleading
proxy
solicitations.
and
we
say
the
answer
to
that
question
is
no.
and
we
say
no
on
three
independent
grounds.
anyone
of
which
is
sufficient
for
the
purpose.
we
say
no
first
of
all
on
the
ground
that
the
mccarran
act
in
the
light
of
the
arizona
statute
bars
this
intervention
by
federal
court
and
by
the
sec
and
the
ninth
circuit
and
the
district
court
took
that
point
of
view.
second,
we
say
as
a
wholly
independent
ground
that
the
whole
thrust
of
what
the
sec
was
seeking
to
do
is
here
is
to
enjoin
the
merger
or
set
it
aside
on
the
ground
of
some
alleged
improprieties
to
the
proxies.
but
they
bring
this
action
under
section
10
under
rule
10
(b)
5.
and
section
10
and
rule
10
(b)
5
don’t
deal
with
proxies.
there’s
a
wholly
different
section.
a
section
14
which
does
deal
with
proxies.
and
this
is
important
because
that
i’m
going
to
develop
it
in
a
moment.
the
proxy
rules
and
provisions
did
not
apply
to
this
particular
insurance
company
at
this
time
at
all.
that
would
not
take
effect
until
the
year
1966
and
more
than
that.
congress
had
expressly
provided
that
by
a
different
act
which
was
not
mentioned
yesterday
but
which
is
discussed
in
the
briefs
into
which
i’ll
come
back
has
expressly
provided
that
insurance
company
proxy
solicitations
are
to
be
subject
to
state
control.
and
the
ninth
circuit
in
general
took
our
position
on
that
point.
then
there
was
a
third
ground
which
we
advanced
and
i’d
like
to
have
that
clearly
in
focus.
rule
10
(b)
5
applies
only
to
the
purchased
and
sale
of
securities
and
if
therefore
there
wasn’t
any
purchase
or
sale
then
there
is
no
scope,
no
place
of
operation
for
the
rule.
and
the
real
question
in
the
case
therefore
at
the
lower
court
stage
was
whether
a
so
called
statutory
merger
was
a
sale
of
securities
at
all,
and
hence,
whether
it
was
within
the
scoped
of
the
statute
in
this
rule.
and
as
i
will
develop
in
just
a
moment
when
mr.
justice
douglas
was
at
the
commission,
when
justice
fortas
was
at
the
commission,
the
commission
took
the
view
that
a
statutory
merger
was
not
a
purchase
or
sale
and
the
ninth
circuit
had
expressly
so
held
on
the
basis
of
a
recommendation
of
the
commission.
and
so
on,
and
in
more
recent
years
the
commission
has
reversed
itself,
and
abandon
that
position.
and
now
seems
to
extend
rule
10
(b)
5
to
mergers.
so
one
of
the
questions
what
the
sec
said
in
the
ninth
circuit
was
the
most
important
question
in
the
case
was
whether
the
ninth
circuit
would
overrule
its
earlier
opinion
on
this
point.
the
ninth
circuit
did
not
need
to
decide
that
particular
question
having
decided
the
mccarran
act
question.
now,
one
problem
which
is
before
this
court
is,
how
many
of
these
independent
grounds
will
it
consider?
and
we
respectfully
submit
that
it
should
consider
them
all.
the
government
says
no,
it
should
not
consider
the
rule
10
(b)
5
or
this
purchase
on
sale
problem
because
it
was
not
expressly
decided
by
the
ninth
circuit
citing
to
an
opinion
of
justice
white
which
typically
holds
that
where
there
are
complex
factual
issues,
which
were
not
considered
at
the
circuit,
then
this
court
may
in
its
discretion
remand
to
permit
those
complex
factual
questions
to
be
considered
rather
than
consider
them
here.
but
the
purchase
and
sale
problem
is
not
accomplished
factual
question.
it
is
a
pure
question
of
law.
there
is
no
factual
record.
the
matter
went
off
on
affidavits
and
a
motion.
and
we
submit
therefore
that
in
your
discretion
this
is
an
independent
ground
for
decision
which
it
may
properly
consider.
mr.
john
p.
frank
yes.
mr.
john
p.
frank
your
honor,
these
are
truly
independent
and
then
you
can
rest
it
on
any
of
them
but
the
most
obvious
thing
to
do
--
mr.
john
p.
frank
the
most
obvious
thing
to
do
--
mr.
john
p.
frank
only
if
you
--
mr.
john
p.
frank
that
is
right.
and
your
honor,
let
me
now
address
myself
to
the
proposition.
such
a
misfortune
should
not
occur.
mr.
john
p.
frank
we
are
not
your
honor.
though
i
must
say
that
if
i
thought
that
this
opinion
was
as
broad
as
the
sg,
solicitor
general
has
had,
i
would
confess
there,
we
have
never
made
any
contention
of
this
broad
scale
sort
has
been
the
concern
of
the
government.
mr.
john
p.
frank
your
honor,
it
might
very
possibly
be
the
basis
for
a
grant
of
injunctive
relief
if
he
went
in
on
diversity
grounds
and
not
under
rule
10
(b)
you’re
claiming
under
the
statute
and
that
is
exactly
what
happened,
your
honor.
mr.
john
p.
frank
that’s
right
your
honor.
and
we,
in
other
words
have
this
been
a
diversity
action
based
on
state
law
then
none
of
these
problems
would
be
here.
we
had
such
a
thing.
we
did
litigate
it,
it
was
disposed
of.
our
problem
now
is
whether
the
rule
and
i’ll
turn
directly
to
your
point
under
the
mccarran
act
reaches
can
be
allowed
to
reach
a
statutory
merger
of
insurance
companies.
mr.
john
p.
frank
your
--
mr.
john
p.
frank
your
honor,
it
would
depend
upon
whether
there
was
a
state
law
dealing
truly
and
effectively
with
the
very
same
subject.
mr.
john
p.
frank
your
honor,
i
could
--
i
would
have
to
answer
that
i
believe
that
the
answer
is
no
because
the
state
of
arizona
has
no
direct
or
equivalent
criminal
law
dealing
with
that
exact
subject.
mr.
john
p.
frank
the
test
and
the
reason
i
put
it
in
alternative
fashion,
your
honor
is
that
your
question
takes
me
by
surprise
and
i
would
have
to
look
back
to
the
code
criminal
provisions
to
be
absolutely
certain.
mr.
john
p.
frank
and
mr.
justice
there
is
the
case
which
probably
is
in
your
mind.
at
least
it’s
well
known
to
circuit
court
cases.
the
case
of
salvanas
from
the
seventh
circuit.
salvanas
holds
that
a
postal
--
mr.
john
p.
frank
your
honor,
--
mr.
john
p.
frank
alright.
and
your
answer,
we
do
say
that
this
is
wrong.
this
basis
that
the
pleadings
here
taken
as
a
whole
if
you
read
the
whole
complaint
and
the
whole
amended
complaint.
taking
the
complaint
and
the
documentation
and
the
remedy
portions
altogether
are
solely
and
exclusively
directed
to
the
object
of
offsetting
an
arizona
insurance
company
merger
and
that
we
say
cannot
be
done
under
the
mccarran
act
whether
you
call
it
a
cause
of
action
or
a
remedy
or
a
merger
of
the
two
of
them.
and
this
is
because
mr.
justice
we
have
a
very
express
code.
our
code
provisions
are
set
forth
in
our
own
brief
if
perhaps
you
had
a
chance
to
look
at
them
earlier
but
as
you
will
see,
we
have
page
49
gives
the
provision
express
language
right
in
the
heart
of
our
insurance
code.
as
to
what
is
the
function
of
the
insurance
department
and
connection
with
a
merger
of
insurance
companies
and
against
this
must
be
balance
the
fact
that
the
mccarran
act
expressly
says
that
no
state
law
shall
be
allowed
to
invalidate,
impair,
or
supersede,
i’m
sorry,
that
no
federal
law
will
be
allowed
to
invalidate,
impair
or
supersede
a
state
law
which
deals
with
the
business
of
insurance.
and
i
have
put
this
question
to
the
government
and
i
put
it
again,
and
i
put
it
with
the
utmost
urgency.
i
cannot
concede
of
how
it
would
be
possible
more
totally
to
supersede
the
arizona
code
20-731.
and
to
sustain
a
position
of
the
sec
in
this
action
because
the
entire
method
that
they
are
saying
is
that
there
shall
be
no
merger
in
the
entire
method
that
the
state
is
saying
under
this
provision
is
that
there
shall
be
a
merger.
now
the
government
in
its
brief,
impression
arises
is
the
merger
and
thus
the
existence
of
an
insurance
company
to
be
regarded
as
part
of
the
business
of
insurance.
the
government
in
its
brief
says
expressly
at
page
17,
historically
such
matter
as
the
chartering
and
licensing
of
insurance
companies
are
matters
for
the
state.
that
is
exactly
what
we
are
dealing
with
here.
the
question
which
was
presented
to
the
arizona
insurance
director
was
whether
the
merge
of
these
insurance
companies
was
to
be
allowed
to
give
birth
of
what
is
for
all
practical
functioning
purposes
a
new
insurance
company.
mr.
john
p.
frank
your
honor,
may
i
answer
that
in
terms
of
how
it
was
done
and
how
it
is
now.
mr.
john
p.
frank
at
the
present
time,
there
is
comprehensive
regulation
because
your
honor,
in
1964,
congress
passed
what
are
known
as
the
1964
amendments
of
which
i
assume
you’re
familiar.
those
amendments
expressly
provided
that
the
states
should
have
proxy
control
and
insurance
companies
if
they
would
adopt
regulations
of
the
national
association
of
insurance
commissions.
and
the
state
of
arizona,
like
all
the
other
50
--
the
other
49
states
have
adopted
some
regulations.
so
that
we
now
have
a
compressive
regulatory
code
over
proxies,
at
the
time
however,
--
mr.
john
p.
frank
that
is
right.
it
is
now
clear
that
proxy
rules
of
the
commission
do
not
apply
and
that
brings
me
to
the
other
aspect
of
the
matter
mr.
justice
white.
the
situation
is
that
congress
has
expressly
by
the
clear
language
of
the
1964
act.
expressly
and
precisely
provided
that
the
proxy
rules
of
the
sec
should
not
apply
to
the
insurance
companies.
mr.
john
p.
frank
that
is
the
whole
point,
your
honor.
frankly,
we
suggest
it
originally.
i
make
bold
to
suggest
now
that
this
is
a
case
in
which
the
certiorari
has
been
improvidently
granted
because
this
is
the
last,
conceivable
case
in
the
united
states
in
which
this
question
could
possibly
come
up.
because
now,
all
of
the
states
have
full
scale
proxy
regulations
but
your
honor,
i
want
to
make
clear
that
we
have
had
a
good
long
a
subject
then
because
arizona
had
adopted
what
is
called
a
little
mccarran
act
earlier
and
we
had
it
as
statutes
expressly
said
in
order
to
comply
and
me
to
require
the
mccarran
act
and
so
on.
and
this
included
numerous
though
less
comprehensive
restrictions
which
would
relate
to
illegalities
as
to
any
financial
statements.
mr.
john
p.
frank
and
the
answer
your
honor
is
this.
that
the
mccarran
act,
this
i
think
is
the
most
fundamental
single
error
mr.
justice
that
we
believe
the
government
makes.
the
government
takes
the
position
in
its
brief
that
there
must
have
been
no
errors
on
the
law
in
point
because
it
disagreed
with
the
commission.
as
for
the
consequences
of
these
particular
statements,
our
position
is
to
the
contrary,
your
honor.
your
decisions
under
the
mccarran
act
do
not
provide,
do
not
require
that
the
state
must
automatically
agree
with
the
federal
government.
under
your
decisions,
it
is
sufficient.
mr.
john
p.
frank
the
conflict
was
not
in
the
law
so
much
as
in
its
application,
mr.
justice.
mr.
john
p.
frank
yes,
our
position
is
--
mr.
john
p.
frank
our
position
would
be
that
the
arizona
law
would
control
as
to
the
weight
to
be
given
to
the
significance
of
one
of
the
proxy
statements.
mr.
john
p.
frank
your
honor,
yes
and
i’d
like
to
--
mr.
john
p.
frank
that
is
correct
and
the
whole
point
we
make
is
your
honor,
what
your
cases
have
said
repeatedly
is
that
the
states
need
not
simply
automatically
echo
or
rubberstamp
the
government.
it
is
enough
if
there
is
legislation
which
fairly
is
directed
to
the
same
general
matters.
let
me
be
precise
about
this.
in
this
instance,
there
is
for
example
as
the
problem
whether
a
given
financial
fact
was
not
disclose
but
it
is
possible
to
argue
that
the
fact
was
adequately
disclose
on
some
other
page
of
some
other
document.
now
that
kind
of
a
determination
has
to
be
made
by
somebody
and
our
point
is
that
it
is
a
decision
which
could
be
made
by
the
arizona
director.
these
are
none
of
the
great
mammoth
points
of
departure.
they
are
simply
questions
of
who
is
going
to
determine
what
weight
is
to
be
attached
to
one
detail
or
another.
mr.
john
p.
frank
no,
they
do
not
your
honor.
mr.
john
p.
frank
well
--
mr.
john
p.
frank
your
honor,
i
simply
approach
it
differently.
and
it
is
our
position
that
what
was
intended
if
i
may
meet
that
very
squarely,
what
was
intended
at
least
was
to
determine
whether
proxy
solicitations
in
connection
with
mergers
would
or
would
not
be
subject
to
federal
state
law.
and
--
mr.
john
p.
frank
yes.
mr.
chief
justice,
i’d
like
to
--
i
see
my
time
is
--
mr.
john
p.
frank
may
i
take
a
moment
or
two
to
wind
up.
mr.
justice
fortas,
all
i
can
say
is
that
if
that
was
the
commission’s
point
of
view
now,
it
was
not
the
commission’s
point
of
view
when
it
presented
the
1964
act
to
congress.
because
in
the
1964
hearings,
they
went
in
and
they
said,
we
need
this
legislation
for
the
purpose
of
controlling.
proxy
solicitations
in
connection
with
mergers
and
they
expressly
said
so.
and
at
no
point
did
they
say
now
we
already
have
this
power
in
some
respects.
or
we
have
it
for
regulatory
purposes.
we
have
it
for
any
purpose
rather
they
went
to
congress
saying
that
they
needed
this
power.
and
now
in
this
case
they
tell
us
that
they
had
it
all
the
time.
i
have
not,
i’d
like
if
i
may
to
mention,
only
to
wined
up
mr.
chief
justice
because
my
time
is
done.
i
bring
to
your
attention
expressly
that
congress
has
repeatedly
had
before
it
the
question
of
whether
it
ought
to
take
hold
of
insurance
mergers
and
has
decided
to
the
contrary.
we
quote
a
report
of
the
senate
judiciary
committee
in
which
that
committee
expressly
takes
up
the
subject
to
mergers
and
says,
“this
is
clearly
an
area
where
amendments
to
the
mccarran
act
may
be
needed.”
but
none
such
have
been
passed.
i
will
not
have
the
opportunity
of
discussing
with
you
your
honors,
the
sale
problem
because
of
the
expiration
of
time.
but
i
commend
that
to
your
consideration
in
the
briefs
which
we
have
presented
to
you.
i
repeat,
when
mr.
justice
douglas
and
mr.
justice
fortas
were
with
the
commission,
their
position
was
that
these
provisions
of
law
did
not
apply
to
mergers
at
all.
it
is
our
position
that
if
it
is
to
be
applied
to
mergers
such
it
certainly
not
be
retroactive
as
against
the
company
such
as
ours
which
could
not
possibly
reasonably
been
expected
to
know
that
that
was
the
law
when
it
faced
these
problems,
i
would
leave
the
matter,
your
honors
with
simply
these
questions.
how
could
the
sec
more
totally
supersede
our
law
by
doing
what
is
it
doing
here
and
the
answer
is,
i
think
it
would
be
impossible.
it
runs
a
snowplow
straight
to
it.
the
real
question
is
who
has
the
power
to
decide
whether
two
insurance
companies
may
merge
or
not
the
most
fundamental
conceivable
question
in
the
business
of
insurance.
but
with
special
attention
to
the
mattes
which
justice
fortas
has
raised.
why
did
the
sec
tell
congress
in
1964
that
it
needed
the
proxy
amendment
to
reach
mergers
it
already
have
that
power?
and
finally,
i
think
the
most
serious
question
of
all
under
the
mccarran
act.
why
did
congress,
and
this
relates
to
the
colloquy
with
justice
white,
why
did
congress
expressly
provide
in
the
1964
act
that
insurance
proxy
solicitation
should
be
under
state
control
if
intended
insurance
proxy
solicitations
to
be
under
federal
control.
thank
you
very
much.
