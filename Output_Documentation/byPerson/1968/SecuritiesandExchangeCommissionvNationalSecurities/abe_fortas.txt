justice
abe
fortas
but
mr.
solicitor
general,
i'd
like
to
direct
your
attention
again
in
this
line
of
thought.
as
i
understand
your
adversary,
it
says
that
the
merger,
the
merger
itself
of
these
companies
was
proved
by
the
insurance
commissions.
now,
arguably
i
supposed
he
would
say
that
the
merger
is
certainly
insurance
company
talking
about
the
merger
of
two
insurance
companies
here.
now
then
along
comes
the
sec
and
says
that
this
aspect
of
that
merger
is
subject
to
federal
law
namely
the
terms
of
the
offer
of
exchange
the
solicitation
of
the
stockholders.
it
says
that
therefore
it's
in
conflict
with
the
mccarran
act
because
this
is
something,
the
merger
that
is
insurance
business.
it's
a
merger
of
two
insurance
companies.
i
don't
profess
to
state
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
that's
my
understanding
of
it?
justice
abe
fortas
let
me
see
if
i
understand
it
because
i
do
believe
that
this
is
where
the
argument
of
the
two
parties
comes
in
collision.
what
you're
saying
is
perhaps
a
merger
of
two
insurance
companies
is
the
business
of
insurance
for
signs
in
some
respects.
but
to
the
extent
that
it
involves
a
solicitation
of
stockholders
consent
that
a
security
holder's
consent
said
that
that
is
not.
that
aspect
of
it
is
not
the
business
of
insurance.
justice
abe
fortas
yes
you
may
go
ahead.
