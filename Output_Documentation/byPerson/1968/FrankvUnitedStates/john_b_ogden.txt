mr.
john
b.
ogden
we're
ready,
mr.
chief
justice
and
member
of
the
court.
i
think
this
case
should
take
a
very
brief
time
because
of
the
fact
that
the
petitioner
was
charged
with
contempt
of
court,
convicted
without
a
jury
after
a
written
demand
and
oral
demand,
and
that
really
is
about
all
there
is
to
this
case.
he,
likewise,
as
--
was
unable,
financially,
to
get
this
case
or
file
a
petitioned
in
this
court,
and
i
--
if
it’s
not
improper,
i
want
to
just
thank
the
court
for
being
so
generous
to
this
man.
it
kind
of
makes
you
feel
awfully
good
to
see
a
man
without
a
dime
in
the
world
to
be
able
to
appear
before
the
highest
court
in
the
country
and
have
his
rights
determined,
and
i
just
say
that
very
sincere
and
i’m
doing
what
i
did
for
nothing,
too.
so,
i
really
don't
have
anything
financially
gained
or
lose.
if
i
win
or
lose
the
case,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference,
but
i
just
felt
like
it
should
be
presented.
now,
if
the
court
please,
in
this
case,
in
1952
in
oklahoma
city,
there
was
a
default
judgment
rendered
against
mr.
frank,
enjoining
him
from,
in
effect,
violating
the
securities
and
exchange
act.
he
is
a
man
that,
to
get
out
and
try
to
drill
all
wild
terrain.
he
never
made
anything
at
it,
but
that
--
in
other
words,
it
wasn't
one
of
these
cases
where
somebody
go
out
and
make
a
lot
of
money,
leaving
everybody
sitting
there.
i
don't
think
his
--
i
don't
think
he
ever
owned
a
car
that's
paid
for,
and
i
know
he
didn't
own
a
home.
he's
just
one
of
those
kinds
of
people.
couldn't
do
much
with
him,
i
guess,
so
they
just
filed
a
suit
against
him
instead
of
prosecuting
him
under
the
securities
and
exchange
act,
and
he
didn't
appear.
they
served
a
summons.
they
used
a
judgment
against
him.
so
then,
after
that,
he
just
kept
on.
he
didn't
pay
much
attention
to
it,
and
so
they
filed
and
got
an
indictment
against
him.
then,
i
went
up
there
and
defended
him
in
the
federal
court
for
three
to
four
days.
i
don't
know
how
long.
the
jury
stayed
out
an
hour
--
i
mean,
almost
over
a
day,
but
they
convicted
him
and
got
18
months
on
appeal
at
the
court
of
appeals
in
denver
for
the
tenth
circuit,
and
it
was
reversed.
then,
after
it
was
reversed,
it
came
back.
why,
judge
volt,
whose
son
at
that
time
was
my
law
partner,
judge
volt
was
a
very
kind
person,
an
awfully
nice
person.
he
suggested
this
case
face
him.
almost
cried.
just
to
let
him
enter
a
plea
of
no
contention
and
get
some
kind
of
little
sentence
and
that
saved
the
government
and
everybody
else
a
lot
of
time,
and
he
finally
did
that
case
and
disposed
over
that
matter.
then,
this
case
came
along
and
i
wasn't
employed
in
it.
mr.
frank
had
moved
to
tulsa,
and
that's
where
the
acts
actually
occurred
and,
i
presume,
the
person
who
wanted
to
be
detective,
that
would've
made
him
cry
and
tulsa
would've
tried
him
in
oklahoma
city.
so,
he
had
another
law
firm,
i
mean,
a
law
firm.
i'm
just
a
one-man
lawyer.
but,
he
had
a
law
firm
represent
him
and
they
demanded
and
did
an
excellent
job
but,
jury
in,
wrote
it
in
writing
and
orally
and
every
other
way.
and,
when
they
presented
it,
the
district
attorney
said
it
was
entitled
to
a
jury
and
he
was
relying
upon
a
section
of
the
statute
which
he
read
to
the
court
and,
from
this,
judge
bohanem,
of
the
fact
that
he
was
entitled
to
a
jury,
just
try
him
for
this
offense
without
a
jury.
the
judge,
however
was
not
too
much
satisfied
on
that
because
he
made
a
remark
and
it's
--
if
i
might
read
it,
i
don't
know
if
it'll
make
any
difference,
what
remark
he
made
but
he
did
make
a
remark
that
he
wasn't
too
satisfied
about
the
question
of
whether
he
was
entitled
to
a
jury
trial.
and
so,
the
judge
said
“well,
i'm
quite
concerned
about
the
defendant's
right
for
a
jury
trial.”
then,
the
district
attorney
read
title
18,
section
3691
usca,
and
from
that,
the
first
part
of
it
--
of
that
section,
would
just
--
there
couldn't
be
any
question
about
it,
but
the
last
part
confused
the
judge
apparently
because
the
first
part
of
that
section,
the
code
says
“whenever
a
contempt
charge
shall
consist
the
willful
disobedience
of
the
unlawful
writ,
process,
or
order,
process
or
to
rule
a
decree
or
command
of
any
district
court
of
the
united
states
by
doing
or
omitting.
omitting
any
act
or
thing
violation
thereof
and
the
act
of
thing
having
done
were
omitted
also
constitutes,
i
think
this
is
important,
this
argument,
if
the
court
please.
also
constitutes
a
criminal
offense
under
any
act
of
current
risk
or
the
laws
of
any
state
in
which
the
act
was
done
or
omitted
the
accused
upon
demand,
therefore,
shall
be
entitled
to
a
trial
by
jury.
now,
that's
usca.
that's
the
code
and
that's
the
section
there.
now,
then
if
we
could
just
stop
there,
then
nobody
would've
been
confused
and
this
case
wouldn't
have
been
here.
but,
the
district
attorney
argued
and
he
claimed
that,
by
virtue
of
this
last
part
of
that
same
section,
that
--
well,
he
wasn't
entitled
to
a
jury.
now,
frankly,
i
don't
know
what
that
last
part
means,
but
i
just
would
like
to
read
for
the
reason
that
that
is
the
reason
of
the
trial
judge,
i
think,
denied
him
of
a
jury
trial.
this
section
shall
not
apply
to
contempts
committed
in
the
presence
of
the
court.
well,
of
course,
everybody
knows
that
anyways.
if
you
get
open
court,
you
just
go
and
use
a
language,
something
the
judge
wouldn't
have
to
call
the
jury
to
try
it
when
it's
committed
in
his
presence.
or
so
near
thereto
as
to
obstruct
the
administration
of
justice.
now,
here's
the
part
“nor
contempts
committed
in
disobedience
of
any
lawful
writ,
process,
order,
rule,
decree,
or
command
entered
in
any
suit
or
action
brought
or
prosecuted
in
the
name
of
or
on
behalf
of
the
united
states.”
now,
that
last
part
there
is
what
caused
the
trial
judge
and
cause
this
man
to
be
denied
trial
by
jury.
so
well-said
that
this
was
an
act
originally
where
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
sued
mr.
frank
and
got
that
judgment.
that's
what
this
charged
with
violating.
since
he
was
charged
with
violating
that
act,
the
trial
judge
thought
that
that
was
an
order
of
the
united
states,
which
i
guess
it
was
because
that
is,
of
course,
part
of
the
united
states
government,
the
exchange
commission,
and
so
--
but,
regards
to
that,
it's
my
contention
and
thought,
i
don't
think
it
had
application
whatever
to
that,
but
it's
my
contention
and
thought
that
there
wouldn't
be
any
way
to
start
out
with
if
congress
would
pass
a
law
today
and
say
“well,
you
can
try
this
man,
give
him
as
much
as
five
years,
but
you
--
he
don't
--
he's
not
entitled
to
the
jury
trial.”
in
other
words,
congress
couldn't
take
away
a
man's
constitutional
rights
to
a
jury
trial.
if
it
tried
to,
i
don't
think
that
action
does,
but
i
can't
find
any
construction
of
it
and
i
can't
tell
you
what
it
meant
but
--
i
mean,
what
it's
been
construed
to
mean.
but,
in
any
rate
and
regards
for
all
that,
we
all
know
that
at
least
i
do,
that
the
congress
couldn't
pass
a
law
and
say
“well,
you're
--
because,
under
the
sixth
amendment,
it
says
“in
all
criminal
offenses,.”
well,
this
is
a
criminal
offense.
and,
if
you'd
pardon
me
for
being
personal,
in
1937,
i
use
to
be
state
district
judge
for
12
years
in
ardmore
and
i
held
a
man
for
contempt
to
court
that's
cited
in
this
opinion
here
by
the
court
of
appeals.
i
mean,
i
say
it's
cited
just
referred
to
but,
in
that
case,
the
court
said
that
contempt
was
a
criminal
offense.
then,
our
court,
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
of
oklahoma
city,
we
don't
appeal
by
regular
supreme
court.
it's
just
how
one
court
for
criminal
appeals,
one
for
civil.
call
the
court
of
criminal
appeals.
well,
the
oklahoma
court
of
criminal
appeals,
ever
since
statehood
has
held
consistently
and
every
time
that
a
man
is
entitled
to
a
jury
in
any
case
where
he's
charged
with
violating
any
order
of
any
court,
and
then
the
constitution
of
oklahoma
so
provides,
and
then
the
constitution
of
the
united
states,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
is
just
as
clear
in
the
sixth
amendment
been
“in
all,”
it
don't
say
“part
of
them.”
then,
if
you--
how
do
you
classify
this?
well,
they
want
to
classify
it
apparently,
i
say
they
and
i
mean
the
solicitor
general,
they
want
to
classify
it
as
a
petty
offense.
they
will
have
to
sp
--
if
you
got
three
years,
well,
a
petty
offense
is
defined
by
the
statute
and
it's
title
18,
article
i,
and
it's
defined
and
it
says
a
petty
offense
cannot
be
more
than
$500
or
six
months
in
jail.
now,
that's
set
out
in
my
brief.
it
--
that's
defined
by
the
statute
itself
as
a
petty
--
this
can't
be
a
petty
offense.
then,
that
same
section
also
defines
a
felony,
and
it
says
that
“any
offense,”
now
this
is
that
same
section
that
i
just
referred
to
defining
a
petty
offense,
also
says
that
“now,
we'll
see
what
a
felony
is.”
if
a
man
can
get
that
or
if
he
can
get
more
than
one
year,
it's
a
felony
under
the
act
of
congress.
that's
the
same
section.
mr.
john
b.
ogden
well,
if
your
honor
please,
i'm
awfully
sorry.
i
don't
know.
i
can't
see
any
indifference
then
and
i'll
show
you
why
i
can't.
i
thought
about
that
a
lot.
suppose,
now
--
mr.
john
b.
ogden
yes,
sir,
but
--
now,
just
let
me
call
this
--
mr.
john
b.
ogden
there's
none
whatever
for
this
reason,
if
your
honor
please,
i'll
show
you
why.
now,
this
man
is
a
good
example.
he's
over
at
tulsa
now.
every
monday
morning,
he
has
to
go
up
there
and
report
to
a
probation
officer,
every
week,
and
tell
him
what
he
did
the
week
before.
if
he
changes
jobs,
he's
got
to
go
report
to
him.
if
he
stops
an
officer,
he
has
to
report
to
him.
he
can't
leave
the
judicial
district
without
going
and
getting
permission
from
the
judge.
in
other
words,
he's
imprisoned
but
outside.
when
you
read
those
restrictions
the
judge
put
on
there,
well,
you
would
see
that
this
man,
now,
he
could
go
right
ahead
here
until
the
line
of
state.
three
years
he
could
go
two
years
and
11
months,
and
29
days
and
still,
three
years
hadn't
run
out.
and,
on
the
last
day,
he
could
go
out
here
and
violate
one
of
those
and
they
go
make
him
serve
the
entire
three
years
and
there's
nothing
he
could
do
about
it.
he
said
“well,
i
know,
but
i
didn't
have
a
jury
trial.”
“it
don't
make
any
difference.
i
put
you
on
probation.
we
didn't
have
to
give
you
a
jury
trial,
but
you're
going
to
serve
three
years
in
the
penitentiary.”
all
lawyers
stated
out
“you
see,
that
wouldn't
be
logic.”
now,
here's
one
other
thing,
and
i
think,
if
your
honor
please
--
mr.
john
b.
ogden
now,
if
your
honor
please,
i
don't
--
i'm
not,
i'm
sure.
i
don't
practice
criminal
law
actually,
and
i
just
once
in
a
while
get
into
one
accidentally.
i'd
s
--
mr.
john
b.
ogden
well,
if
your
honor
please,
may
i
just
say
this
in
court
on
that
regard,
the
way
i
look
at
it.
i
think,
just
logically
now,
you
can
see
if
because
you
put
him
on
probation,
he
wasn't
entitled
to
jury
trial
and
got
three
years,
but
he's
one
entitled
to
jury
trial.
mr.
john
b.
ogden
yes,
three
years
on
probation.
mr.
john
b.
ogden
well,
i
would
just
assume,
if
your
honor
please,
i
don't
have
any
way
of
knowing,
of
course,
but
i
would
say
--
mr.
john
b.
ogden
three
years,
that
bound
to
be
some
reason
to
put
the
three
years.
mr.
john
b.
ogden
now,
if
your
honor
please,
that,
i've
always
considered
if
you
put
somebody
on
probation
for
three
years
or
five
years,
that
any
time
during
that
period
of
time,
if
they
violated
the
probation,
they
just
had
to
go
serve
the
three
years.
now,
that's
my
conception
of
it
but
i
might
be
wrong,
but
i
want
to
call
this
to
your
attention
then
i'm
through.
in
this
case,
just
look
how
foolish
it
would
be
if
you
put
a
constitutional
provision
in
here
that
a
man
is
entitled
to
a
jury
trial
in
a
criminal
case.
well,
is
this
a
criminal
case?
no,
that's
the
way
it
looks
to
me,
but
say
whether
put
him
on
probation
so
you
can't
complain
about
that
it's
a
wait
"just
a
minute".
under
the
solicitor
general's
brief
and
his
opinion,
i
mean,
i
guess
it's
the
way
i
construe
it
at
least,
his
opinion
simply
is
that
you're
--
say,
you're
a
federal
district
judge
and
you
come
up
here
and
a
man
is
going
to
be
tried
and
say
“well,
now,
just
a
minute."
you
want
a
jury
trial
but
i
can't
tell
whether
i'd
give
you
a
jury
trial
or
not
until
i
try
your
case
and
see
whether
i
put
you
on
probation,
i
may
decide
to
put
you
on
probation.
so,
if
i
do,
you
wouldn't
be
entitled
to
a
jury
trial.
so,
i'll
have
to
try
you
first
to
see
whether
i'm
going
to
give
you
probation.
then
if
i
decide
i
couldn't
give
you
probation,
then
we'll
have
to
call
a
jury.”
that
was
what
that
actually
means
in
a
case
like
that.
now,
this
man,
to
start
out
with,
it's
a
lot
more
serious,
i
guess.
i
never
had
been
tried,
but
--
in
a
criminal
case,
but
i
do
believe,
or
any
other
kind,
but
i
do
believe
this,
that
a
man
either
has
the
right
to
a
jury
trial
in
this
kind
of
a
case
or
he
doesn't
have
it.
i
don't
know
whether
he
does
not.
he's
charged
with
criminal
contempt.
the
punishment
might
have
been
three
years
and
he'll
have
to
serve
up
to
five.
i
don't
--
it
could
go
up
to
five,
i
think.
but,
anyway,
he
either
--
when
he
walked
up
there
and
said
“judge,
i
want
a
jury
trial.”
now,
i
don't
think,”
of
course
i
won't
tell
you
this.
frankly,
of
course,
i
wouldn't
have
a
way.
i
wouldn't
even
claim
i
had
any
knowledge
whatever
on
what
a
jury
would
or
wouldn't
do
because
no
one
does.
but,
at
the
same
time,
i
really
think
the
jury
would
turn
him
loose,
but
they
might
not.
but,
regards
to
that,
he
had
that
right
and
he
had
a
right
to
say
“i
won't
plan
in
here
to
say,
by
unanimous
verdict,
that
i'm
guilty
of
a
crime
or
i'm
not
guilty
of
a
crime.”
here's
a
man,
of
course,
that
doesn't
make
any
difference.
that
poor
man
is,
i
guess,
80
somewhat
years
old,
i
don't
know,
but
i
know
one
thing,
that
there
wouldn't
be
a
man
in
this
courtroom
anymore
sincere
that
what
he
did
that
he
thought
he
was
doing
right.
i
just
actually
believe
that
in
my
head.
but,
whether
he
did
or
didn't,
he
was
entitled
to
jury
trial
and,
in
my
opinion,
should
have.
now,
there's
one
other
thing.
now,
that
is
a
case
cited
here
in
that
opinion,
but
the
court
of
appeals
believed
it,
joiner
--
c.m.
joiner.
well,
this
man
here
is
just
like
that.
there
are
some
of
the
old
people
getting
baptized
that
believed
him
that
they
can
find
all
some
kind
of
a
doodle
bug
or
something
and
you
could
--
you'd
have
to
kill
them
to
make
them
not
believe
that.
they
actually
believed.
and
this
old
man
joiner
lived
near
me
in
ardmore
and
he
couldn't
even
pass
grossville.
he
went
on
here
in
texas,
discovered
the
texas
oil
field,
the
biggest
field
in
the
world,
the
first
one.
that
joiner,
c.m.
joiner.
well,
he
is
one
of
these
doodle
bug
people
too,
and
that's
what
this
is.
well,
his
oil
people
don't
like
the
doodle
bug
people,
and
i
don't
either.
i
don't
think
it
really
amount
to
a
hell
of
meaning,
but
you
couldn't
make
him
believe
this.
so,
that's
all
there
is
to
it.
and,
he
went
out
this
time
and
he
didn't
think
he's
violating
the
law.
i
had
nothing
to
with
it.
didn't
know
what
he
had
done,
but
he
just
goes
out
and
borrowed
money,
you
see,
and
give
people
a
note
for
10
years,
then
claimed
when
he
hit
oil,
he'll
pay
them
back.
of
course,
it
might
have
been
there
for
getting
remedy,
but
whether
it
was
or
wasn't,
why,
that's
why
i
did
math.
i
thank
the
court
for
listening
to
my
argument.
mr.
john
b.
ogden
your
honor,
if
the
court
please,
i'll
just
say
this
and
i'll
be
very
brief
because
i
said
all
i
think
that
i
care
to
say
or
should
say
in
connection
with
this
matter,
but,
now,
here's
a
man.
just
take
this
for
example.
he's
already
been
on
a
probation,
i'm
just
going
to
say
roughly
two
years.
now
then,
suppose
he
had
violated
that,
they
bring
him
back
over
to
oklahoma
city
and
say
“well,
you
violated
your
probation.
i
want
to
sentence
you
to
six
months.
”
well,
that
would
be
six
months
plus
two
years
on
probation.
now,
whether
probation,
what
effect
it
has
or
not,
if
your
honor
please,
i'm
just
going
to
call
this
to
your
attention.
i
think,
and
of
course
i
said
that
just
the
thought
which
actually
means
nothing,
but
it's
just
my
opinion
that
when
a
person
put
on
probation
for
three
years,
that
if
he
makes
a
good
citizen,
doesn't
violate
any
of
the
terms
until
three
years,
11
months,
and
29
days,
then
they
can
take
him
and
make
him
serve
three
years,
but
i
think
a
lot
of
times,
maybe,
that
i
get
off
of
the
actual
point
involved,
as
i
view
it,
on
that
question
but
because
all
there
is
to
it,
as
i
see
it
and
it
probably
isn't
that
simple,
here's
a
man
charged
of
a
crime
and
you
say
“why
was
he
charged
of
the
crime?”
well,
because
the
statute
makes
it
a
crime
and
that's
what
the
court
said
here
that
they
found
him
guilty
of
a
crime.
so,
the
court
said
that
“i
convict
you,”
and
i
will
read
right
here
from
this
appendix
and
then
i
think
i'm
through
on
that
part
of
it,
but
it
is
the
judge,
this
is
the
court
speaking,
“that
the
defendant
is
guilty
as
charged
and
convicted.”
that's
what
the
judge
said.
now,
he
was
convicted.
now,
when
you
try
a
man
and
convict
him
of
a
crime
and
if
you'll
notice
everything
in
here,
the
complaint,
the
charge,
everything,
and
the
case
criminal,
so
and
so,
the
number
of
the
case
of
the
united
states
district
court
was
criminal
so,
in
number
so
and
so,
criminal.
and,
the
charge
--
criminal
charge,
the
whole
thing
had
been
fitted,
of
course
it
is
a
crime,
and
there's
no
any
question
about
that.
now
then,
i
want
to
call
then
to
the
court's
attention
another
time
for
emphasis
sake
and
i
hope
it
isn't
burdensome
view
but
the
statute
itself
should
take
care
of
this
case
and
i
--
the
reason
i
say
it
should
is
because
title
18
article
i
us,
offenses
classified,
any
offense.
don't
make
it
what
offense.
any
offense
punishable
by
death
or
imprisonment
for
a
term
exceeding
one
year
is
a
felony.
so
now,
you
try
the
man
for
a
felony.
say,
why
do
you
say
that?
because
the
punishment
exceeds
a
year,
and
when
it
exceeds
a
year,
“and
death
or
punishment
exceeding
a
year,”
then
it
is
a
felony
under
the
statute.
so,
you
tried
a
man
whose
been
tried
in
here
for
a
felony.
now,
the
next
--
very
next
section
says
“any
other
offense
besides
that
is
a
misdemeanor.”
now,
i
don't
--
now,
the
last
one,
here's
the
one
that
i
especially
want
to
call
the
court's
attention
about
this
petty
offense
business
this
is
statutory,
“any
misdemeanor,
the
penalty
for
which
does
not
exceed
imprisonment
for
a
period
of
six
months,”
if
you
could
imprison
a
man
for
six
months
and
one
day,
it's
not
a
petty
offense,
“and/or
a
fine
not
to
exceed
$500,”
if
you
could
find
him
$501,
it
wouldn't
be
a
petty
--
“or
both
is
a
petty
offense.”
that's
what
the
law
says
of
petty
offenses.
then,
the
constitution
says
that
in
all
criminal
prosecutions,
the
accused
shall
enjoy
the
right
to
a
trial
by
impartial
jury.
now
then,
the
question,
is
this
a
criminal
prosecution?
it
certainly
is
not
a
civil
action.
now,
may
i
read
what
the
judge
said
to
this
man
here,
what's
on
this,
“it
is
a
judge
that
had
found
guilty.”
now,
that
--
i
want
to
call
your
attention
to
one
other
thing
and
that
is
that,
on
this
--
it's
in
the
brief
of
the
solicitor
general
and
it's
in
the
appendix,
and
here
it
is
just
here.
he
sets
out
in
here
the
conditions
under
which
mr.
frank
had
to
serve
for
these
three
years.
now,
i
won't
read
them
all,
“but
you
shall
refrain
from
a
violation
of
any
law,
federal,
state,
or
local.
you
shall
get
in
touch
immediately
with
your
probation
officer
if
arrested
or
questioned
by
law
enforcement
officers.
you
shall
associate
only
with
law
abiding
persons
and
maintain
reasonable
hours.
you
shall
work
regularly
at
your
occupation
and
support
your
legal
dependents
if
they're
into
the
best
of
your
ability.
when
out
of
work,
you
shall
notify
your
probation
officer
at
once
and
you
shall
consult
him
prior
to
change
in
jobs.
”
you
can't
even
change
jobs
without
him.
“you
shall
not
leave
the
judicial
district
without
permission
of
the
probation
officer.
”
oklahoma
is
divided
into
three
districts:
northern,
and
the
western,
and
the
--
let's
see,
the
northern,
the
western,
and
the
eastern
districts.
it's
safe
through
that
in
those
three
districts.
well,
he
is
in
the
eastern
district,
up
there
at
tulsa.
he
can't
even
leave
that
district
without
permission
and
say,
while
it
didn't
matter
much,
i'd
hate
to
have
to
get
to
where
he
couldn't
leave.
i
think
it's
a
restraint.
“you
shall
follow
the
probation
officer's
instruction.
you
shall
report
to
the
probation
officer
as
directed.
”
and
then,
“you
have
to
report
in
oklahoma
city
on
the
first
day
of
each
month
beginning
august
1966,
for
a
period
of
three
years
and
fill
out
one
of
the
blank
reports
and
mail,
in
addition
to
all
this,
or
bring
the
same
to
the
probation
officer
in
oklahoma
city,
oklahoma.”
now
then,
“your
failure
to
comply
with
the
instructions
of
the
court
as
outlined
herein
will
be
cause
for
revocation
of
your
probation.”
that's
the
solicitor's
record.
now,
if
the
court
please,
that's
actually
all
that
i
care
to
say.
it
just
seems
to
me
like,
that
to
apply
the
constitution
to
this
case,
that
it
was
a
criminal
case
and
all
over
the
united
states,
i
guess,
every
place
i've
been,
i
didn't
know
in
any
cities,
if
they
can
fine
a
man
over
$20,
they
have
to
give
him
a
jury
trial.
they
believe,
at
least,
and
that's
the
way
they
do
because
of
the
constitutional
position.
but,
here's
a
man
whose
put
on
probation
for
three
years
and
ordered
with
all
these
restrictions
upon
him
and,
now
then,
he
demanded
in
writing
and
orally
a
trial
by
jury,
and
it
was
denied
to
him.
so,
i
feel
like,
under
the
law,
as
in
this
case,
and
under
the
decision,
it
doesn't
seem
to
me,
honestly
like,
when
i
read
it,
that
when
this
court
said
well,
we
feel
like
we
should
these
other
--
these
judges
orally
contra
when
the
jury
trial
is
demanded
and
you
set
it
all
out
there,
i
thought
of
just
as
plain
as
it
could
be,
and
that's
on
the
case.
i
exercise
my
brief
because
i
couldn't
see
any
citing
of
it.
and,
of
course,
if
i
may
again,
thank
your
honors
for
permitting
to
be
appear,
it's
been
a
great
pleasure.
mr.
john
b.
ogden
we're
ready,
mr.
chief
justice
and
member
of
the
court.
i
think
this
case
should
take
a
very
brief
time
because
of
the
fact
that
the
petitioner
was
charged
with
contempt
of
court,
convicted
without
a
jury
after
a
written
demand
and
oral
demand,
and
that
really
is
about
all
there
is
to
this
case.
he,
likewise,
as
--
was
unable,
financially,
to
get
this
case
or
file
a
petitioned
in
this
court,
and
i
--
if
it’s
not
improper,
i
want
to
just
thank
the
court
for
being
so
generous
to
this
man.
it
kind
of
makes
you
feel
awfully
good
to
see
a
man
without
a
dime
in
the
world
to
be
able
to
appear
before
the
highest
court
in
the
country
and
have
his
rights
determined,
and
i
just
say
that
very
sincere
and
i’m
doing
what
i
did
for
nothing,
too.
so,
i
really
don't
have
anything
financially
gained
or
lose.
if
i
win
or
lose
the
case,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference,
but
i
just
felt
like
it
should
be
presented.
now,
if
the
court
please,
in
this
case,
in
1952
in
oklahoma
city,
there
was
a
default
judgment
rendered
against
mr.
frank,
enjoining
him
from,
in
effect,
violating
the
securities
and
exchange
act.
he
is
a
man
that,
to
get
out
and
try
to
drill
all
wild
terrain.
he
never
made
anything
at
it,
but
that
--
in
other
words,
it
wasn't
one
of
these
cases
where
somebody
go
out
and
make
a
lot
of
money,
leaving
everybody
sitting
there.
i
don't
think
his
--
i
don't
think
he
ever
owned
a
car
that's
paid
for,
and
i
know
he
didn't
own
a
home.
he's
just
one
of
those
kinds
of
people.
couldn't
do
much
with
him,
i
guess,
so
they
just
filed
a
suit
against
him
instead
of
prosecuting
him
under
the
securities
and
exchange
act,
and
he
didn't
appear.
they
served
a
summons.
they
used
a
judgment
against
him.
so
then,
after
that,
he
just
kept
on.
he
didn't
pay
much
attention
to
it,
and
so
they
filed
and
got
an
indictment
against
him.
then,
i
went
up
there
and
defended
him
in
the
federal
court
for
three
to
four
days.
i
don't
know
how
long.
the
jury
stayed
out
an
hour
--
i
mean,
almost
over
a
day,
but
they
convicted
him
and
got
18
months
on
appeal
at
the
court
of
appeals
in
denver
for
the
tenth
circuit,
and
it
was
reversed.
then,
after
it
was
reversed,
it
came
back.
why,
judge
volt,
whose
son
at
that
time
was
my
law
partner,
judge
volt
was
a
very
kind
person,
an
awfully
nice
person.
he
suggested
this
case
face
him.
almost
cried.
just
to
let
him
enter
a
plea
of
no
contention
and
get
some
kind
of
little
sentence
and
that
saved
the
government
and
everybody
else
a
lot
of
time,
and
he
finally
did
that
case
and
disposed
over
that
matter.
then,
this
case
came
along
and
i
wasn't
employed
in
it.
mr.
frank
had
moved
to
tulsa,
and
that's
where
the
acts
actually
occurred
and,
i
presume,
the
person
who
wanted
to
be
detective,
that
would've
made
him
cry
and
tulsa
would've
tried
him
in
oklahoma
city.
so,
he
had
another
law
firm,
i
mean,
a
law
firm.
i'm
just
a
one-man
lawyer.
but,
he
had
a
law
firm
represent
him
and
they
demanded
and
did
an
excellent
job
but,
jury
in,
wrote
it
in
writing
and
orally
and
every
other
way.
and,
when
they
presented
it,
the
district
attorney
said
it
was
entitled
to
a
jury
and
he
was
relying
upon
a
section
of
the
statute
which
he
read
to
the
court
and,
from
this,
judge
bohanem,
of
the
fact
that
he
was
entitled
to
a
jury,
just
try
him
for
this
offense
without
a
jury.
the
judge,
however
was
not
too
much
satisfied
on
that
because
he
made
a
remark
and
it's
--
if
i
might
read
it,
i
don't
know
if
it'll
make
any
difference,
what
remark
he
made
but
he
did
make
a
remark
that
he
wasn't
too
satisfied
about
the
question
of
whether
he
was
entitled
to
a
jury
trial.
and
so,
the
judge
said
“well,
i'm
quite
concerned
about
the
defendant's
right
for
a
jury
trial.”
then,
the
district
attorney
read
title
18,
section
3691
usca,
and
from
that,
the
first
part
of
it
--
of
that
section,
would
just
--
there
couldn't
be
any
question
about
it,
but
the
last
part
confused
the
judge
apparently
because
the
first
part
of
that
section,
the
code
says
“whenever
a
contempt
charge
shall
consist
the
willful
disobedience
of
the
unlawful
writ,
process,
or
order,
process
or
to
rule
a
decree
or
command
of
any
district
court
of
the
united
states
by
doing
or
omitting.
omitting
any
act
or
thing
violation
thereof
and
the
act
of
thing
having
done
were
omitted
also
constitutes,
i
think
this
is
important,
this
argument,
if
the
court
please.
also
constitutes
a
criminal
offense
under
any
act
of
current
risk
or
the
laws
of
any
state
in
which
the
act
was
done
or
omitted
the
accused
upon
demand,
therefore,
shall
be
entitled
to
a
trial
by
jury.
now,
that's
usca.
that's
the
code
and
that's
the
section
there.
now,
then
if
we
could
just
stop
there,
then
nobody
would've
been
confused
and
this
case
wouldn't
have
been
here.
but,
the
district
attorney
argued
and
he
claimed
that,
by
virtue
of
this
last
part
of
that
same
section,
that
--
well,
he
wasn't
entitled
to
a
jury.
now,
frankly,
i
don't
know
what
that
last
part
means,
but
i
just
would
like
to
read
for
the
reason
that
that
is
the
reason
of
the
trial
judge,
i
think,
denied
him
of
a
jury
trial.
this
section
shall
not
apply
to
contempts
committed
in
the
presence
of
the
court.
well,
of
course,
everybody
knows
that
anyways.
if
you
get
open
court,
you
just
go
and
use
a
language,
something
the
judge
wouldn't
have
to
call
the
jury
to
try
it
when
it's
committed
in
his
presence.
or
so
near
thereto
as
to
obstruct
the
administration
of
justice.
now,
here's
the
part
“nor
contempts
committed
in
disobedience
of
any
lawful
writ,
process,
order,
rule,
decree,
or
command
entered
in
any
suit
or
action
brought
or
prosecuted
in
the
name
of
or
on
behalf
of
the
united
states.”
now,
that
last
part
there
is
what
caused
the
trial
judge
and
cause
this
man
to
be
denied
trial
by
jury.
so
well-said
that
this
was
an
act
originally
where
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
sued
mr.
frank
and
got
that
judgment.
that's
what
this
charged
with
violating.
since
he
was
charged
with
violating
that
act,
the
trial
judge
thought
that
that
was
an
order
of
the
united
states,
which
i
guess
it
was
because
that
is,
of
course,
part
of
the
united
states
government,
the
exchange
commission,
and
so
--
but,
regards
to
that,
it's
my
contention
and
thought,
i
don't
think
it
had
application
whatever
to
that,
but
it's
my
contention
and
thought
that
there
wouldn't
be
any
way
to
start
out
with
if
congress
would
pass
a
law
today
and
say
“well,
you
can
try
this
man,
give
him
as
much
as
five
years,
but
you
--
he
don't
--
he's
not
entitled
to
the
jury
trial.”
in
other
words,
congress
couldn't
take
away
a
man's
constitutional
rights
to
a
jury
trial.
if
it
tried
to,
i
don't
think
that
action
does,
but
i
can't
find
any
construction
of
it
and
i
can't
tell
you
what
it
meant
but
--
i
mean,
what
it's
been
construed
to
mean.
but,
in
any
rate
and
regards
for
all
that,
we
all
know
that
at
least
i
do,
that
the
congress
couldn't
pass
a
law
and
say
“well,
you're
--
because,
under
the
sixth
amendment,
it
says
“in
all
criminal
offenses,.”
well,
this
is
a
criminal
offense.
and,
if
you'd
pardon
me
for
being
personal,
in
1937,
i
use
to
be
state
district
judge
for
12
years
in
ardmore
and
i
held
a
man
for
contempt
to
court
that's
cited
in
this
opinion
here
by
the
court
of
appeals.
i
mean,
i
say
it's
cited
just
referred
to
but,
in
that
case,
the
court
said
that
contempt
was
a
criminal
offense.
then,
our
court,
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
of
oklahoma
city,
we
don't
appeal
by
regular
supreme
court.
it's
just
how
one
court
for
criminal
appeals,
one
for
civil.
call
the
court
of
criminal
appeals.
well,
the
oklahoma
court
of
criminal
appeals,
ever
since
statehood
has
held
consistently
and
every
time
that
a
man
is
entitled
to
a
jury
in
any
case
where
he's
charged
with
violating
any
order
of
any
court,
and
then
the
constitution
of
oklahoma
so
provides,
and
then
the
constitution
of
the
united
states,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
is
just
as
clear
in
the
sixth
amendment
been
“in
all,”
it
don't
say
“part
of
them.”
then,
if
you--
how
do
you
classify
this?
well,
they
want
to
classify
it
apparently,
i
say
they
and
i
mean
the
solicitor
general,
they
want
to
classify
it
as
a
petty
offense.
they
will
have
to
sp
--
if
you
got
three
years,
well,
a
petty
offense
is
defined
by
the
statute
and
it's
title
18,
article
i,
and
it's
defined
and
it
says
a
petty
offense
cannot
be
more
than
$500
or
six
months
in
jail.
now,
that's
set
out
in
my
brief.
it
--
that's
defined
by
the
statute
itself
as
a
petty
--
this
can't
be
a
petty
offense.
then,
that
same
section
also
defines
a
felony,
and
it
says
that
“any
offense,”
now
this
is
that
same
section
that
i
just
referred
to
defining
a
petty
offense,
also
says
that
“now,
we'll
see
what
a
felony
is.”
if
a
man
can
get
that
or
if
he
can
get
more
than
one
year,
it's
a
felony
under
the
act
of
congress.
that's
the
same
section.
mr.
john
b.
ogden
well,
if
your
honor
please,
i'm
awfully
sorry.
i
don't
know.
i
can't
see
any
indifference
then
and
i'll
show
you
why
i
can't.
i
thought
about
that
a
lot.
suppose,
now
--
mr.
john
b.
ogden
yes,
sir,
but
--
now,
just
let
me
call
this
--
mr.
john
b.
ogden
there's
none
whatever
for
this
reason,
if
your
honor
please,
i'll
show
you
why.
now,
this
man
is
a
good
example.
he's
over
at
tulsa
now.
every
monday
morning,
he
has
to
go
up
there
and
report
to
a
probation
officer,
every
week,
and
tell
him
what
he
did
the
week
before.
if
he
changes
jobs,
he's
got
to
go
report
to
him.
if
he
stops
an
officer,
he
has
to
report
to
him.
he
can't
leave
the
judicial
district
without
going
and
getting
permission
from
the
judge.
in
other
words,
he's
imprisoned
but
outside.
when
you
read
those
restrictions
the
judge
put
on
there,
well,
you
would
see
that
this
man,
now,
he
could
go
right
ahead
here
until
the
line
of
state.
three
years
he
could
go
two
years
and
11
months,
and
29
days
and
still,
three
years
hadn't
run
out.
and,
on
the
last
day,
he
could
go
out
here
and
violate
one
of
those
and
they
go
make
him
serve
the
entire
three
years
and
there's
nothing
he
could
do
about
it.
he
said
“well,
i
know,
but
i
didn't
have
a
jury
trial.”
“it
don't
make
any
difference.
i
put
you
on
probation.
we
didn't
have
to
give
you
a
jury
trial,
but
you're
going
to
serve
three
years
in
the
penitentiary.”
all
lawyers
stated
out
“you
see,
that
wouldn't
be
logic.”
now,
here's
one
other
thing,
and
i
think,
if
your
honor
please
--
mr.
john
b.
ogden
now,
if
your
honor
please,
i
don't
--
i'm
not,
i'm
sure.
i
don't
practice
criminal
law
actually,
and
i
just
once
in
a
while
get
into
one
accidentally.
i'd
s
--
mr.
john
b.
ogden
well,
if
your
honor
please,
may
i
just
say
this
in
court
on
that
regard,
the
way
i
look
at
it.
i
think,
just
logically
now,
you
can
see
if
because
you
put
him
on
probation,
he
wasn't
entitled
to
jury
trial
and
got
three
years,
but
he's
one
entitled
to
jury
trial.
mr.
john
b.
ogden
yes,
three
years
on
probation.
mr.
john
b.
ogden
well,
i
would
just
assume,
if
your
honor
please,
i
don't
have
any
way
of
knowing,
of
course,
but
i
would
say
--
mr.
john
b.
ogden
three
years,
that
bound
to
be
some
reason
to
put
the
three
years.
mr.
john
b.
ogden
now,
if
your
honor
please,
that,
i've
always
considered
if
you
put
somebody
on
probation
for
three
years
or
five
years,
that
any
time
during
that
period
of
time,
if
they
violated
the
probation,
they
just
had
to
go
serve
the
three
years.
now,
that's
my
conception
of
it
but
i
might
be
wrong,
but
i
want
to
call
this
to
your
attention
then
i'm
through.
in
this
case,
just
look
how
foolish
it
would
be
if
you
put
a
constitutional
provision
in
here
that
a
man
is
entitled
to
a
jury
trial
in
a
criminal
case.
well,
is
this
a
criminal
case?
no,
that's
the
way
it
looks
to
me,
but
say
whether
put
him
on
probation
so
you
can't
complain
about
that
it's
a
wait
"just
a
minute".
under
the
solicitor
general's
brief
and
his
opinion,
i
mean,
i
guess
it's
the
way
i
construe
it
at
least,
his
opinion
simply
is
that
you're
--
say,
you're
a
federal
district
judge
and
you
come
up
here
and
a
man
is
going
to
be
tried
and
say
“well,
now,
just
a
minute."
you
want
a
jury
trial
but
i
can't
tell
whether
i'd
give
you
a
jury
trial
or
not
until
i
try
your
case
and
see
whether
i
put
you
on
probation,
i
may
decide
to
put
you
on
probation.
so,
if
i
do,
you
wouldn't
be
entitled
to
a
jury
trial.
so,
i'll
have
to
try
you
first
to
see
whether
i'm
going
to
give
you
probation.
then
if
i
decide
i
couldn't
give
you
probation,
then
we'll
have
to
call
a
jury.”
that
was
what
that
actually
means
in
a
case
like
that.
now,
this
man,
to
start
out
with,
it's
a
lot
more
serious,
i
guess.
i
never
had
been
tried,
but
--
in
a
criminal
case,
but
i
do
believe,
or
any
other
kind,
but
i
do
believe
this,
that
a
man
either
has
the
right
to
a
jury
trial
in
this
kind
of
a
case
or
he
doesn't
have
it.
i
don't
know
whether
he
does
not.
he's
charged
with
criminal
contempt.
the
punishment
might
have
been
three
years
and
he'll
have
to
serve
up
to
five.
i
don't
--
it
could
go
up
to
five,
i
think.
but,
anyway,
he
either
--
when
he
walked
up
there
and
said
“judge,
i
want
a
jury
trial.”
now,
i
don't
think,”
of
course
i
won't
tell
you
this.
frankly,
of
course,
i
wouldn't
have
a
way.
i
wouldn't
even
claim
i
had
any
knowledge
whatever
on
what
a
jury
would
or
wouldn't
do
because
no
one
does.
but,
at
the
same
time,
i
really
think
the
jury
would
turn
him
loose,
but
they
might
not.
but,
regards
to
that,
he
had
that
right
and
he
had
a
right
to
say
“i
won't
plan
in
here
to
say,
by
unanimous
verdict,
that
i'm
guilty
of
a
crime
or
i'm
not
guilty
of
a
crime.”
here's
a
man,
of
course,
that
doesn't
make
any
difference.
that
poor
man
is,
i
guess,
80
somewhat
years
old,
i
don't
know,
but
i
know
one
thing,
that
there
wouldn't
be
a
man
in
this
courtroom
anymore
sincere
that
what
he
did
that
he
thought
he
was
doing
right.
i
just
actually
believe
that
in
my
head.
but,
whether
he
did
or
didn't,
he
was
entitled
to
jury
trial
and,
in
my
opinion,
should
have.
now,
there's
one
other
thing.
now,
that
is
a
case
cited
here
in
that
opinion,
but
the
court
of
appeals
believed
it,
joiner
--
c.m.
joiner.
well,
this
man
here
is
just
like
that.
there
are
some
of
the
old
people
getting
baptized
that
believed
him
that
they
can
find
all
some
kind
of
a
doodle
bug
or
something
and
you
could
--
you'd
have
to
kill
them
to
make
them
not
believe
that.
they
actually
believed.
and
this
old
man
joiner
lived
near
me
in
ardmore
and
he
couldn't
even
pass
grossville.
he
went
on
here
in
texas,
discovered
the
texas
oil
field,
the
biggest
field
in
the
world,
the
first
one.
that
joiner,
c.m.
joiner.
well,
he
is
one
of
these
doodle
bug
people
too,
and
that's
what
this
is.
well,
his
oil
people
don't
like
the
doodle
bug
people,
and
i
don't
either.
i
don't
think
it
really
amount
to
a
hell
of
meaning,
but
you
couldn't
make
him
believe
this.
so,
that's
all
there
is
to
it.
and,
he
went
out
this
time
and
he
didn't
think
he's
violating
the
law.
i
had
nothing
to
with
it.
didn't
know
what
he
had
done,
but
he
just
goes
out
and
borrowed
money,
you
see,
and
give
people
a
note
for
10
years,
then
claimed
when
he
hit
oil,
he'll
pay
them
back.
of
course,
it
might
have
been
there
for
getting
remedy,
but
whether
it
was
or
wasn't,
why,
that's
why
i
did
math.
i
thank
the
court
for
listening
to
my
argument.
mr.
john
b.
ogden
your
honor,
if
the
court
please,
i'll
just
say
this
and
i'll
be
very
brief
because
i
said
all
i
think
that
i
care
to
say
or
should
say
in
connection
with
this
matter,
but,
now,
here's
a
man.
just
take
this
for
example.
he's
already
been
on
a
probation,
i'm
just
going
to
say
roughly
two
years.
now
then,
suppose
he
had
violated
that,
they
bring
him
back
over
to
oklahoma
city
and
say
“well,
you
violated
your
probation.
i
want
to
sentence
you
to
six
months.
”
well,
that
would
be
six
months
plus
two
years
on
probation.
now,
whether
probation,
what
effect
it
has
or
not,
if
your
honor
please,
i'm
just
going
to
call
this
to
your
attention.
i
think,
and
of
course
i
said
that
just
the
thought
which
actually
means
nothing,
but
it's
just
my
opinion
that
when
a
person
put
on
probation
for
three
years,
that
if
he
makes
a
good
citizen,
doesn't
violate
any
of
the
terms
until
three
years,
11
months,
and
29
days,
then
they
can
take
him
and
make
him
serve
three
years,
but
i
think
a
lot
of
times,
maybe,
that
i
get
off
of
the
actual
point
involved,
as
i
view
it,
on
that
question
but
because
all
there
is
to
it,
as
i
see
it
and
it
probably
isn't
that
simple,
here's
a
man
charged
of
a
crime
and
you
say
“why
was
he
charged
of
the
crime?”
well,
because
the
statute
makes
it
a
crime
and
that's
what
the
court
said
here
that
they
found
him
guilty
of
a
crime.
so,
the
court
said
that
“i
convict
you,”
and
i
will
read
right
here
from
this
appendix
and
then
i
think
i'm
through
on
that
part
of
it,
but
it
is
the
judge,
this
is
the
court
speaking,
“that
the
defendant
is
guilty
as
charged
and
convicted.”
that's
what
the
judge
said.
now,
he
was
convicted.
now,
when
you
try
a
man
and
convict
him
of
a
crime
and
if
you'll
notice
everything
in
here,
the
complaint,
the
charge,
everything,
and
the
case
criminal,
so
and
so,
the
number
of
the
case
of
the
united
states
district
court
was
criminal
so,
in
number
so
and
so,
criminal.
and,
the
charge
--
criminal
charge,
the
whole
thing
had
been
fitted,
of
course
it
is
a
crime,
and
there's
no
any
question
about
that.
now
then,
i
want
to
call
then
to
the
court's
attention
another
time
for
emphasis
sake
and
i
hope
it
isn't
burdensome
view
but
the
statute
itself
should
take
care
of
this
case
and
i
--
the
reason
i
say
it
should
is
because
title
18
article
i
us,
offenses
classified,
any
offense.
don't
make
it
what
offense.
any
offense
punishable
by
death
or
imprisonment
for
a
term
exceeding
one
year
is
a
felony.
so
now,
you
try
the
man
for
a
felony.
say,
why
do
you
say
that?
because
the
punishment
exceeds
a
year,
and
when
it
exceeds
a
year,
“and
death
or
punishment
exceeding
a
year,”
then
it
is
a
felony
under
the
statute.
so,
you
tried
a
man
whose
been
tried
in
here
for
a
felony.
now,
the
next
--
very
next
section
says
“any
other
offense
besides
that
is
a
misdemeanor.”
now,
i
don't
--
now,
the
last
one,
here's
the
one
that
i
especially
want
to
call
the
court's
attention
about
this
petty
offense
business
this
is
statutory,
“any
misdemeanor,
the
penalty
for
which
does
not
exceed
imprisonment
for
a
period
of
six
months,”
if
you
could
imprison
a
man
for
six
months
and
one
day,
it's
not
a
petty
offense,
“and/or
a
fine
not
to
exceed
$500,”
if
you
could
find
him
$501,
it
wouldn't
be
a
petty
--
“or
both
is
a
petty
offense.”
that's
what
the
law
says
of
petty
offenses.
then,
the
constitution
says
that
in
all
criminal
prosecutions,
the
accused
shall
enjoy
the
right
to
a
trial
by
impartial
jury.
now
then,
the
question,
is
this
a
criminal
prosecution?
it
certainly
is
not
a
civil
action.
now,
may
i
read
what
the
judge
said
to
this
man
here,
what's
on
this,
“it
is
a
judge
that
had
found
guilty.”
now,
that
--
i
want
to
call
your
attention
to
one
other
thing
and
that
is
that,
on
this
--
it's
in
the
brief
of
the
solicitor
general
and
it's
in
the
appendix,
and
here
it
is
just
here.
he
sets
out
in
here
the
conditions
under
which
mr.
frank
had
to
serve
for
these
three
years.
now,
i
won't
read
them
all,
“but
you
shall
refrain
from
a
violation
of
any
law,
federal,
state,
or
local.
you
shall
get
in
touch
immediately
with
your
probation
officer
if
arrested
or
questioned
by
law
enforcement
officers.
you
shall
associate
only
with
law
abiding
persons
and
maintain
reasonable
hours.
you
shall
work
regularly
at
your
occupation
and
support
your
legal
dependents
if
they're
into
the
best
of
your
ability.
when
out
of
work,
you
shall
notify
your
probation
officer
at
once
and
you
shall
consult
him
prior
to
change
in
jobs.
”
you
can't
even
change
jobs
without
him.
“you
shall
not
leave
the
judicial
district
without
permission
of
the
probation
officer.
”
oklahoma
is
divided
into
three
districts:
northern,
and
the
western,
and
the
--
let's
see,
the
northern,
the
western,
and
the
eastern
districts.
it's
safe
through
that
in
those
three
districts.
well,
he
is
in
the
eastern
district,
up
there
at
tulsa.
he
can't
even
leave
that
district
without
permission
and
say,
while
it
didn't
matter
much,
i'd
hate
to
have
to
get
to
where
he
couldn't
leave.
i
think
it's
a
restraint.
“you
shall
follow
the
probation
officer's
instruction.
you
shall
report
to
the
probation
officer
as
directed.
”
and
then,
“you
have
to
report
in
oklahoma
city
on
the
first
day
of
each
month
beginning
august
1966,
for
a
period
of
three
years
and
fill
out
one
of
the
blank
reports
and
mail,
in
addition
to
all
this,
or
bring
the
same
to
the
probation
officer
in
oklahoma
city,
oklahoma.”
now
then,
“your
failure
to
comply
with
the
instructions
of
the
court
as
outlined
herein
will
be
cause
for
revocation
of
your
probation.”
that's
the
solicitor's
record.
now,
if
the
court
please,
that's
actually
all
that
i
care
to
say.
it
just
seems
to
me
like,
that
to
apply
the
constitution
to
this
case,
that
it
was
a
criminal
case
and
all
over
the
united
states,
i
guess,
every
place
i've
been,
i
didn't
know
in
any
cities,
if
they
can
fine
a
man
over
$20,
they
have
to
give
him
a
jury
trial.
they
believe,
at
least,
and
that's
the
way
they
do
because
of
the
constitutional
position.
but,
here's
a
man
whose
put
on
probation
for
three
years
and
ordered
with
all
these
restrictions
upon
him
and,
now
then,
he
demanded
in
writing
and
orally
a
trial
by
jury,
and
it
was
denied
to
him.
so,
i
feel
like,
under
the
law,
as
in
this
case,
and
under
the
decision,
it
doesn't
seem
to
me,
honestly
like,
when
i
read
it,
that
when
this
court
said
well,
we
feel
like
we
should
these
other
--
these
judges
orally
contra
when
the
jury
trial
is
demanded
and
you
set
it
all
out
there,
i
thought
of
just
as
plain
as
it
could
be,
and
that's
on
the
case.
i
exercise
my
brief
because
i
couldn't
see
any
citing
of
it.
and,
of
course,
if
i
may
again,
thank
your
honors
for
permitting
to
be
appear,
it's
been
a
great
pleasure.
