mr.
peter
l.
strauss
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think,
at
the
outset,
there
are
perhaps
a
couple
of
factual
matters
that
i
should
mention.
the
indictment,
which
was
brought
against
petitioner
in
1953
or
1954
and
on
which
he
was
originally
convicted,
specified
as
a
period
of
the
offenses
for
which
he
was
convicted
--
the
fraud
offenses
for
which
he
was
convicted,
the
same
period
on
which
the
injunction,
in
which
this
contempt
violation
is
based.
and
so,
as
far
as
we
know
at
least,
there's
not
a
question
of
his
having
continued
after
1952,
when
this
injunction
was
entered,
to
violate
the
act
leading
at
that
point
then
to
a
conviction.
there
is
some
indication
in
the
record
at
page
231,
i
believe,
it's
not
reproduced
in
the
appendix,
that
in
the
37
months
proceeding
the
contempt
violation
or
the
adjudication
of
contempt
in
this
case,
the
petitioner
was
able
to
earn
or
obtain
something
in
the
order
of
$37,000
from
various
people
from
whom
he
had
solicited
funds.
he
did
that
principally
through
advertisements
in
the
tulsa,
oklahoma
daily
world.
these
advertisements
profit
--
excuse
me,
promised
a
high
level
or
earnings
in
a
rather
short
period
of
time.
it's
true
that
the
transaction
was
couched
in
terms
of
a
note,
but
the
trial
court
found,
and
there
is
no
contest
to
that
here,
of
course,
that
this
was
really
a
thin
disguise.
the
petitioner
had
no
intention
of
repaying
the
note
he
gave
and
that,
consequently,
the
transaction
should
be
viewed
as,
in
effect,
a
violation
of
the
injunction
which
the
scc
had
obtained
against
him
in
1952.
and,
i
will
only
--
i'd
be
on
that,
that
while
the
injunction
was
obtained
by
default,
there
is
no
question
that
petitioner
was
not,
in
the
first
place,
served,
of
course,
before
the
injunction
proceedings
and,
in
the
second
place,
personally
served
with
a
copy
of
the
injunction
after
the
injunction
was
entered.
i
should
also
say,
what
should
be
quite
clear,
that
petitioner
is
not
and
never
has
been
subject
either
to
a
three
year
jail
term
or
to
the
threat
of
such
a
term.
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
used
the
following
words.
“it
is
a
judge
that
imposition
of
sentence
be
suspended,
and
the
defendant
is
hereby
placed
on
probation
for
a
period
of
three
years
from
this
date.”
that's
in
the
appendix
at
page
24,
and
you
can
find
language
to
the
same
effect
in
the
court
order
at
pages
25
and
27
of
the
appendix.
the
court's
reference
to
impos
--
suspension
of
the
imposition
of
sentence
indicates
that
it
was
acting
according
to
section
3651
of
title
18
and,
therefore,
that
it
had
imposed
no
sentence.
the
government's
view
of
this
case,
particularly
since
it
arose
after
this
court's
decision
in
cheff
versus
schnackenberg,
this
court's
decision
came
down
on
june
6,
the
order
to
show
cause
was
issued
on
june
16,
1966,
the
hearing
on
the
jury
demand
was
held
in
july
22,
and
the
final
order
of
sentence
came
on
september
1.
so
that,
the
government's
position
is
that
once
that
case
had
been
decided,
in
effect,
any
time
a
jury
demand
was
refused
by
a
federal
court
in
a
contempt
case,
the
court
was
thereby
ruling
that
it
would
try
the
case
as
a
petty
offense.
so
that,
from
the
moment
the
jury
demand
was
refused,
we
take
the
position
and
we
have
conceded
all
along
the
possible
penalties
which
could
be
put
--
imposed
in
this
case
were
limited
to
those
which
could
be
imposed
under
this
court's
decision
in
cheff,
that
is
to
say,
any
punishment
which
would
be
possible
under
--
for
a
petty
offense
under
the
united
states
code
and
the
constitution.
so
that,
the
government's
position
can
be
stated
very
briefly,
under
this
court's
cases,
there
do
exists
a
class
of
petty
offenses
which
do
not
require
a
jury
trial,
although
they
may
be
criminal
in
nature.
while
in
general,
the
court
has
investigated
the
nature
of
the
offense
as
well
as
the
penalty
provided
for
it
in
determining
whether
to
classify
any
particular
offense
as
petty
in
this
constitutional
sentence.
it
determined
in
cheff
that
the
nature
of
criminal
contempt
was
not
such
as
to
require
a
jury
trial
in
all
cases.
criminal
contempt
may
be,
in
some
cases,
a
petty
offense,
but
the
penalty
range
for
criminal
contempt
is
not
set
by
statute
and,
therefore,
the
court
said
as
recently
as
last
year
in
bloom,
that
it
would
treat
criminal
contempt
as
a
petty
offense
unless
the
punishment
imposed
makes
it
a
serious
offense.
and,
we
assume
that
this
frames
the
issue
in
this
case,
whether
three
years
of
probation
is
such
a
serious
punishment
as
to
have
required
a
trial
by
jury,
a
punishment
which
could
not
be
authorized
for
a
petty
offense.
and,
our
position
is
that
the
punishment
is
both
a
statutory
punishment
for
petty
offenses
and
a
constitutional
punishment
for
petty
offenses
and,
therefore,
that
no
jury
trial
was
required.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
excuse
me,
sir?
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
did
say
that.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
why
do
i
say?
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well,
in
the
statutory
sense
first,
the
federal
probation
statute,
which
is
section
3651
of
title
18,
states
without
any
qualification
that
any
offense
which
is
not
punishable
by
life
imprisonment
or
the
death
penalty
may,
instead,
be
treated
by
a
sentence
of
probation.
and
then,
states
that
that
term
of
probation
shall
not
exceed
five
years.
it
states
this
without
qualification
and,
of
course,
a
petty
offense,
since
that
is
defined
as
an
offense
by
section
1
of
title
18
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
the
statute
does
authorize
the
imposition
of
a
term
of
probation
of
five
years
in
petty
offenses.
that's
correct.
that's
our
position.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
if
he
were
in
jail?
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
quite
plainly,
it
would
be
improper.
there
is
no
statutory
authorization
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
for
five
years.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
we
draw
that
distinction
but,
more
importantly,
we
believe
congress
has
drawn
that
distinction.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well,
i
think
you're
referring
to
jones
versus
cunningham.
and,
the
issue
there
was
whether
there
was
any
constraint
or
not,
such
as
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
you
held
that
there
was
constraint.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
and,
we
do
not
deny
that
there
is
constraint
in
this
case.
however,
your
honor,
the
court,
last
term,
indicated
that
it
would
view
not
only,
it
seems
to
me,
the
fact
of
constraint
itself,
but
the
seriousness
of
the
constraint.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well
all
i
think
one
has
to
take
into
account
the
sort
of
constraints
which
are
involved.
i
think
most
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well,
i
think
most
of
us
would
prefer
that
to
having
to
report
every
morning
at
6:45
inside
a
cellblock.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well,
i
agree
that
that
is
the
question
in
this
case.
how
much
less
is
it?
and,
it's
our
position
that
it
is
sufficiently
less,
that
this
three
year
term
of
probation
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
is
awfully
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
we
don't
have
to
argue
that
case,
thankfully.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
thankfully,
we
don't
have
to
argue
that
case.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well,
no,
your
honor,
it's
not,
and
for
this
reason.
in
the
bloom
case
last
term,
the
majority
opinion
which
you
joined
indicated
that
the
court's
first
reference
in
cases
such
as
this
would
be
the
practice
of
the
nation
as
a
whole
would
be
an
objective
reference,
and
this
really
is
quite
consistent
with
what
has
been
historically
its
approach
as
far
back
as
district
of
columbia
versus
clawans.
the
court
said
that
in
judging
the
question
of
seriousness
of
a
penalty,
this
is
page
628,
“doubts
must
be
resolved
not
subjectively
by
recourse
of
the
judge
to
his
own
sympathy
and
emotions,
but
by
objective
standards
such
as
may
be
observed
in
the
laws
and
practices
of
the
community,
taken
as
a
gauge
of
its
social
and
ethical
judgments.”
well,
if
we
look
at
section
2401
of
the
united
states
code,
for
example,
we
find
that
it's
quite
clear
that
congress
has
made
that
the
--
has
made
the
provisions
of
the
federal
probation
act
applicable
to
petty
offenses.
and,
if
we
look
at
the
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
and
to
others
as
well,
but
to
petty
offenses
in
particular
which
is
the
question
here.
that
is,
i
take
it,
the
question
is
whether
this
is
too
serious
a
punishment.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
the
question.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
to
probation
or
to
jail?
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
any
sentence
to
jail
in
excess
of
six
months
in
a
contempt
case,
under
this
court's
ruling
in
cheff
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
would
be
improper.
i
don't
believe
i
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
excuse
me?
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
yes,
but
i
believe
that
--
your
honor,
that
that
question
--
well,
let
me
put
it
another
way,
if
i
may.
let
us
suppose
that
mr.
frank,
in
this
case,
had
been
sentenced
not
to
three
years
on
probation
but
had
been
sentenced
to
six
months
of
hard
labor
on
the
rock
pile
of
maximum
security
prison
with
solitary
confinement
and
a
diet
of
a
disciplinary
standard.
i
don't
suppose
that
we
would
be
in
a
very
good
position
coming
in
here
to
argue
to
this
court
that,
while
that
sentence
fit
within
the
six
month
standard
which
this
court
had
announced
in
cheff,
because
it's
not
only
the
duration
of
a
sentence
which
may
indicate
what
its
seriousness
is,
but,
again,
i
think
the
main
point
is
that
this
court
has
indicated,
and
quite
properly
so,
that
it
will
make
up
its
mind
on
these
issues
by
referring
to
national
practice
rather
than
to
its
own
feelings
about
the
issue.
and,
national
practice
in
the
first
instance,
the
federal
probation
act
in
the
second
instance,
the
survey
of
state
laws
which
we
had
made
in
our
brief,
that
seems
to
us,
indicate
that
a
three
year
term
of
probation
for
a
minor
offense
is
not
at
all
out
of
the
ordinary.
yes?
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
if
--
if
it
might
be
a
sentence
of
three
years
in
jail.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
think
there's
no
question
but
that,
under
this
court's
holdings
last
term,
that
would
be
an
improper
judgment.
that
is,
in
part,
why
i
said
at
the
beginning
of
the
argument
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
six
months.
our
position
is
that
once
cheff
was
decided,
the
effect
of
that
decision
was
to
impose
a
maximum
limitation
on
federal
judges
sitting
in
contempt
cases
where
there's
denying
of
jury
trial.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well,
i
know
i
wouldn't
take
that
position,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
would
say,
under
cheff,
that's
improper,
but
i
also
say,
under
cheff,
that
once
a
judge
has
denied
jury
trial,
if
he
then
at
least
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
goes
on
without
giving
indication
that
he
is
--
does
not
understand
that
opinion,
once
he
has
denied
a
jury
trial,
he
has
limit
himself
to
six
months.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
that's
right.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
that
is
a
possibility,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well,
i'm
not
sure
that
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
agree
that
that's
a
problem.
i'm
not
sure
that
the
court's
--
i'm
not
sure
that
the
court's
opinion
resolved
that
problem.
i
did
have
the
chance
to
look
at
some
statistics
on
that
question
and,
in
the
same
--
which
may
be
relevant,
in
the
same
report
of
the
administrative
office
of
us
courts
regarding
persons
under
supervision
in
the
federal
probation
system,
which
we
cite
with
respect
to
commission
or
practice,
it
gives
some
indication
of
the
incidence
of
removals
from
probation,
and
it
shows
that,
generally
speaking,
only
one
out
of
every
seven
probationers
is
ever
removed.
so
that
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
and,
he
wouldn't
have
to
give
six
months.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
he
could
give
less.
so
that,
while
we
agree
that
that
possibility
is
something
which
ought
to
be
taken
into
account
in
assessing
the
seriousness,
i
don't
think
it
should
be
made
conclusive.
we
would,
in
effect,
be
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
yes?
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
yes,
i
believe
there
is.
i
believe
it's
found
in
the
federal
probation
act
in
section
3651
of
that
act.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
yes,
upon
entering
a
judgment
of
conviction
of
any
offense
not
punishable
by
death
or
life
imprisonment,
and
it
continues,
any
court
having
jurisdiction
to
try
offenses
against
the
united
states,
of
course
that
includes
petty
offenses,
may
suspend
the
imposition
or
execution
of
sentence.
and,
i
think
this
case,
for
exam
--
this
court,
for
example,
in
the
case
of
roberts
versus
united
states,
which
i
believe
is
in
342
us
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
drew
that
distinction.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i'm
not
sure
i
follow,
your
honor.
he
could
be
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
right.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
the
judge
in
this
particular
circumstance
may
revoke
probation,
although
he's
not
required
to
do
so.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
where,
in
this
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
he
then
proceeds
to
sentence
which
he
has
previously
suspended.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
he
had
suspended
the
imposition
of
the
sentence.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
no,
i
take
it,
that
would
require
--
if
it
were
a
penal
offense,
that
would
require
a
criminal
trial
in
itself.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
that's
right.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
that's
right.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
we
think
that
would
affirmatively
show
that
he
had
misunderstood
this
court's
ruling
in
cheff.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
or
that
he
had
determined
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well,
i
take
it,
your
honor,
that
if
that
should
ever
occur
to
a
judge
in
the
course
of
a
trial
of
a
contempt
he
had
thought
would
be
petty,
what
he
would
probably
do
would
be
to
declare
a
mistrial
at
that
point.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
and
convene
a
jury.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
that's
section
3651
of
title
18.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
may
it
please
the
court.
i
should,
perhaps
for
a
minute,
discuss
section
3691
of
title
18
since
counsel
raised
the
question.
this
was
one
of
the
principle
grounds
for
argument
in
the
court
below,
although
it
was
not
raised
in
the
certiorari
petition.
and,
basically,
the
question
there,
as
i
think
counsel
recognized,
is
whether
this
was
an
action
brought
by
or
on
behalf
of
the
united
states
or
not.
if
it
was
not
brought
on
behalf
of
the
united
states,
a
jury
trial
was
required
under
that
section.
if
it
was
brought
on
behalf
of
the
united
states,
a
jury
was
not
required.
in
fact,
the
civil
action
was
brought
in
the
name
of
the
securities
and
exchange
commission,
an
independent
agency
of
the
united
states
government,
so
that,
the
argument
would
be
that
an
action
brought
by
that
agency
was
not
one
brought
on
behalf
of
the
united
states.
very
briefly,
i
think,
the
legislative
history
of
the
provision,
which
has
been
before
the
court
before,
makes
it
plain
that
none
of
the
sponsors
thought
they
were
distinguishing
between
actions
involving
the
united
states
and
actions
involving
one
of
its
agencies.
the
principal
concern
of
the
statute
was
with
the
use
of
injunctions
and
labor
cases
between
private
parties
to
press
one
side
of
the
dispute,
and
remarks
were
made
to
the
effect
that
the
enactment
left
all
powers
that
exist
in
the
government
at
present,
undisturbed
by
its
passage.
there
is
no
extensive
case
along
the
subject
principally
because
i
think
all
courts
to
which
the
question
has
been
presented
have
treated
it
summarily,
as
did
the
tenth
circuit
below,
simply
stating
that,
of
course,
an
action
brought
by
an
agency
of
the
united
states
was
one
brought
on
behalf
of
the
united
states.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
no
one
asked,
but
i
thought
i
should
make
that
clear.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
the
contempt
action
was
brought
by
the
--
an
attorney
for
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
and
the
united
states
attorney
acting
together
and,
as
it
was
a
criminal
action,
i
suppose
it
would
be
under
the
caption
“united
states
versus
frank,”
but
the
original
con
--
the
original
injunction
which
is
what
would
be
relevant
to
3691
was
brought
in
the
name
of
the
securities
and
exchange
commission.
well,
as
i
was
saying
before
lunch
hour,
we
feel
that
the
basic
mode
of
decision
as
to
the
comparative
seriousness
of
the
probation
in
this
case
was
set
out
by
this
court
last
term
in
bloom
and
earlier
than
that
in
clawans,
that
is,
the
consultation
of
the
laws
and
practices
of
the
nation
to
see
what
comparisons
have
been
drawn.
in
general
and
as
we
set
out
in
our
brief,
we
did
attempt
such
a
study.
it
was
a
study
complicated
by
the
substantial
variants
which
this
court
noted
last
term
in
state
practice
regarding
the
affording
of
jury
trials
with
the
sorts
of
offenses
that
concerns
us
here.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
so.
our
point
is
that
the
question
of
equivalency
is
primarily
a
legislative
judgment
and
that
if
we
can
show
that
the
judgment
made
by
one
legislature,
in
this
case,
the
congress,
it
is
within
the
general
scope
of
the
laws
and
practices
of
the
nation
as
a
whole,
then,
that
is
sufficient
to
defend
the
judgment.
in
fact,
it
seems
to
me
that
it
might
be
the
converse
if
you
asked
about
the
particular
probation
imposed
in
a
particular
case.
you
might
get
into
just
the
problem
which
concerns
you.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
no,
i
think
i
was
trying
to
make
a
slightly
different
point.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well,
from
this
perspective,
looking
at
the
national
scheme
as
a
whole,
we
think
the
results
are
quiet
striking.
there
are
only
12
jurisdictions
which
limit
the
probation
term
to
the
same
extent
as
penal
terms.
on
the
other
hand,
15
provide,
as
does
the
federal
statute,
for
a
maximum
period
of
probation
of
5
years
without
regard
to
the
offense
committed.
there
are
nine
--
nine
jurisdictions
in
which
the
question
is
left
to
the
court's
discretion
and
the
remainder
provided
for
maximum
between
one
and
three
years
with
the
great
majority
in
the
upper
half
of
that
reign.
while
we
were
able
to
supply
the
court
with
figures
regarding
the
practice
of
united
states
commissioners
in
probation
cases,
which
indicates
that
they
regularly
imposed
probation
sentences
or
probation
terms,
i
should
say,
in
excess
of
six
months,
of
course
is
the
limit
of
their
authority
under
--
as
far
as
jail
sentences
are
concerned
under
the
code.
we
have
been
unable
to
obtain
such
figures
for
the
nation
as
a
whole,
but
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
no,
i'm
still
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
believe
his
question
was
whether
i
would
regard
it
differently
if
the
probation
period
was
10
years.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
yes.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
there's
no
statutory
authorization
that
i'm
aware
of
for
such
a
term.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
yes.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
yes,
i
would.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
no,
i
do
not
regard
five
years
is
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
would
regard
eight
years
is
different.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
regard
six
years
as
different.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
the
point
is,
as
this
court
admonished
last
term
in
the
bloom
case,
that
we
are
to
look
to
the
nation's
law
and
practices.
looking
to
the
nation's
law
in
--
nation's
law
and
practices,
we
find
irregular
legislative
practice
of
authorizing
probation
terms
up
to
five
years
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
for
education.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
yes.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
but,
i
think
that
question
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well,
i
think
the
reason
is
important,
your
honor.
what
i've
been
trying
to
do
is
to
apply
those
tests
which
the
court
set
out
last
term.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well,
it's
true,
your
honor,
that
i
have
assumed
that
the
constitutional
questions
which
were
decided
last
term
in
bloom
and
duncan
were
the
questions
which,
principally,
would
be
decided
in
connection
with
what
i
agree
is,
strictly
speaking,
a
question
of
cheff
versus
schnackenberg
which
was
not,
as
stated,
a
constitutional
decision.
and,
what
i
have
been
trying
to
do
is
to
present
the
case
in
terms
of
the
criteria
that
the
court
stated
it
would
look
to
in
deciding
the
constitutional
question
and
those
criteria
were,
in
the
words
of
the
court,
objective
criteria,
chiefly,
the
existing
laws
and
practices
of
the
state.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
alright,
there
may
be
--
there
are
perhaps
several
ways
in
which
i
can
answer
that.
one
is,
there
is
a
basic
statutory
authorization
involved
here,
section
3401
of
title
18,
which,
as
we
have
indicated,
is
an
authorization
which
is
frequently
used
by
united
states
commissioners.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
for
petty
offenses,
necessarily.
over
50%
of
the
petty
offense
probation
terms
are
in
excess
of
six
months,
over
25%
are
in
excess
of
one
year.
so
that,
in
fact
and
in
practice,
there
is
statutory
and
practical
authorization
for
this
practice.
the
second
argument,
it's
a
policy
argument,
if
that
makes
any
difference,
has
to
do
with
the
nature
of
probation
itself.
while
it
is
backed
up
by
the
threat
of
punishment,
to
be
sure,
a
probation
is
not
a
punitive
device
and
i
do
not
believe
that
anyone
subjected
to
probation
views
it
as
such.
that
is,
if
he
has
his
choice,
he
takes
the
probation
and,
in
effect,
as
i'm
sure
the
court
appreciates,
any
defendant
preferring
to
go
to
jail
for
six
months
would
be
able
to
do
so.
even
if
the
law
didn't
authorize
him
to
refuse
the
conditions
of
probation,
he
could
simply
announce
to
the
court
“well,
i'm
going
out
and
first
thing
i'm
going
to
do
is
to
disobey
them.”
so
that,
in
practical
terms,
if
one
is
talking
about
an
alternative
which
is
somewhat
within
the
defendant's
control.
as
this
court
has
recognized
in
the
past,
probation
is
a
rehabilitative
device
and
is
--
it's
designed
--
really,
the
decision
is
to
how
long
it
should
be
is
made
on
the
basis
of
rehabilitative
considerations.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
if
i
may
respond
to
that,
your
honor,
i
see
my
time
is
up.
that
is
a
theory,
but
it's
only
a
part
of
the
theory
as
to
imprisonment
and
legislatures,
frankly,
vary
the
amount
of
imprisonment
they
provide
for
crimes
in
direct
relationship
to
their
view
of
the
seriousness
of
the
of
crime
involved,
and
that's
not
done
in
general
with
respect
to
probation.
so
that,
we
submit,
that
probation
in
this
case
was
authorized
by
statute.
it
meets
the
tests
which
the
court
set
out
last
terms
in
duncan
and
bloom.
it
was
an
appropriate
disposition
for
this
case
and,
consequently,
the
judgment
below
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
yes?
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
suppose
it
would
have
to
be
less
than
that,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
you'd
have
a
sort
of
declining
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
enforcement
demise.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
you
couldn't
do
that.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
no,
you
couldn't.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think,
at
the
outset,
there
are
perhaps
a
couple
of
factual
matters
that
i
should
mention.
the
indictment,
which
was
brought
against
petitioner
in
1953
or
1954
and
on
which
he
was
originally
convicted,
specified
as
a
period
of
the
offenses
for
which
he
was
convicted
--
the
fraud
offenses
for
which
he
was
convicted,
the
same
period
on
which
the
injunction,
in
which
this
contempt
violation
is
based.
and
so,
as
far
as
we
know
at
least,
there's
not
a
question
of
his
having
continued
after
1952,
when
this
injunction
was
entered,
to
violate
the
act
leading
at
that
point
then
to
a
conviction.
there
is
some
indication
in
the
record
at
page
231,
i
believe,
it's
not
reproduced
in
the
appendix,
that
in
the
37
months
proceeding
the
contempt
violation
or
the
adjudication
of
contempt
in
this
case,
the
petitioner
was
able
to
earn
or
obtain
something
in
the
order
of
$37,000
from
various
people
from
whom
he
had
solicited
funds.
he
did
that
principally
through
advertisements
in
the
tulsa,
oklahoma
daily
world.
these
advertisements
profit
--
excuse
me,
promised
a
high
level
or
earnings
in
a
rather
short
period
of
time.
it's
true
that
the
transaction
was
couched
in
terms
of
a
note,
but
the
trial
court
found,
and
there
is
no
contest
to
that
here,
of
course,
that
this
was
really
a
thin
disguise.
the
petitioner
had
no
intention
of
repaying
the
note
he
gave
and
that,
consequently,
the
transaction
should
be
viewed
as,
in
effect,
a
violation
of
the
injunction
which
the
scc
had
obtained
against
him
in
1952.
and,
i
will
only
--
i'd
be
on
that,
that
while
the
injunction
was
obtained
by
default,
there
is
no
question
that
petitioner
was
not,
in
the
first
place,
served,
of
course,
before
the
injunction
proceedings
and,
in
the
second
place,
personally
served
with
a
copy
of
the
injunction
after
the
injunction
was
entered.
i
should
also
say,
what
should
be
quite
clear,
that
petitioner
is
not
and
never
has
been
subject
either
to
a
three
year
jail
term
or
to
the
threat
of
such
a
term.
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
used
the
following
words.
“it
is
a
judge
that
imposition
of
sentence
be
suspended,
and
the
defendant
is
hereby
placed
on
probation
for
a
period
of
three
years
from
this
date.”
that's
in
the
appendix
at
page
24,
and
you
can
find
language
to
the
same
effect
in
the
court
order
at
pages
25
and
27
of
the
appendix.
the
court's
reference
to
impos
--
suspension
of
the
imposition
of
sentence
indicates
that
it
was
acting
according
to
section
3651
of
title
18
and,
therefore,
that
it
had
imposed
no
sentence.
the
government's
view
of
this
case,
particularly
since
it
arose
after
this
court's
decision
in
cheff
versus
schnackenberg,
this
court's
decision
came
down
on
june
6,
the
order
to
show
cause
was
issued
on
june
16,
1966,
the
hearing
on
the
jury
demand
was
held
in
july
22,
and
the
final
order
of
sentence
came
on
september
1.
so
that,
the
government's
position
is
that
once
that
case
had
been
decided,
in
effect,
any
time
a
jury
demand
was
refused
by
a
federal
court
in
a
contempt
case,
the
court
was
thereby
ruling
that
it
would
try
the
case
as
a
petty
offense.
so
that,
from
the
moment
the
jury
demand
was
refused,
we
take
the
position
and
we
have
conceded
all
along
the
possible
penalties
which
could
be
put
--
imposed
in
this
case
were
limited
to
those
which
could
be
imposed
under
this
court's
decision
in
cheff,
that
is
to
say,
any
punishment
which
would
be
possible
under
--
for
a
petty
offense
under
the
united
states
code
and
the
constitution.
so
that,
the
government's
position
can
be
stated
very
briefly,
under
this
court's
cases,
there
do
exists
a
class
of
petty
offenses
which
do
not
require
a
jury
trial,
although
they
may
be
criminal
in
nature.
while
in
general,
the
court
has
investigated
the
nature
of
the
offense
as
well
as
the
penalty
provided
for
it
in
determining
whether
to
classify
any
particular
offense
as
petty
in
this
constitutional
sentence.
it
determined
in
cheff
that
the
nature
of
criminal
contempt
was
not
such
as
to
require
a
jury
trial
in
all
cases.
criminal
contempt
may
be,
in
some
cases,
a
petty
offense,
but
the
penalty
range
for
criminal
contempt
is
not
set
by
statute
and,
therefore,
the
court
said
as
recently
as
last
year
in
bloom,
that
it
would
treat
criminal
contempt
as
a
petty
offense
unless
the
punishment
imposed
makes
it
a
serious
offense.
and,
we
assume
that
this
frames
the
issue
in
this
case,
whether
three
years
of
probation
is
such
a
serious
punishment
as
to
have
required
a
trial
by
jury,
a
punishment
which
could
not
be
authorized
for
a
petty
offense.
and,
our
position
is
that
the
punishment
is
both
a
statutory
punishment
for
petty
offenses
and
a
constitutional
punishment
for
petty
offenses
and,
therefore,
that
no
jury
trial
was
required.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
excuse
me,
sir?
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
did
say
that.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
why
do
i
say?
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well,
in
the
statutory
sense
first,
the
federal
probation
statute,
which
is
section
3651
of
title
18,
states
without
any
qualification
that
any
offense
which
is
not
punishable
by
life
imprisonment
or
the
death
penalty
may,
instead,
be
treated
by
a
sentence
of
probation.
and
then,
states
that
that
term
of
probation
shall
not
exceed
five
years.
it
states
this
without
qualification
and,
of
course,
a
petty
offense,
since
that
is
defined
as
an
offense
by
section
1
of
title
18
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
the
statute
does
authorize
the
imposition
of
a
term
of
probation
of
five
years
in
petty
offenses.
that's
correct.
that's
our
position.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
if
he
were
in
jail?
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
quite
plainly,
it
would
be
improper.
there
is
no
statutory
authorization
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
for
five
years.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
we
draw
that
distinction
but,
more
importantly,
we
believe
congress
has
drawn
that
distinction.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well,
i
think
you're
referring
to
jones
versus
cunningham.
and,
the
issue
there
was
whether
there
was
any
constraint
or
not,
such
as
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
you
held
that
there
was
constraint.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
and,
we
do
not
deny
that
there
is
constraint
in
this
case.
however,
your
honor,
the
court,
last
term,
indicated
that
it
would
view
not
only,
it
seems
to
me,
the
fact
of
constraint
itself,
but
the
seriousness
of
the
constraint.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well
all
i
think
one
has
to
take
into
account
the
sort
of
constraints
which
are
involved.
i
think
most
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well,
i
think
most
of
us
would
prefer
that
to
having
to
report
every
morning
at
6:45
inside
a
cellblock.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well,
i
agree
that
that
is
the
question
in
this
case.
how
much
less
is
it?
and,
it's
our
position
that
it
is
sufficiently
less,
that
this
three
year
term
of
probation
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
is
awfully
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
we
don't
have
to
argue
that
case,
thankfully.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
thankfully,
we
don't
have
to
argue
that
case.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well,
no,
your
honor,
it's
not,
and
for
this
reason.
in
the
bloom
case
last
term,
the
majority
opinion
which
you
joined
indicated
that
the
court's
first
reference
in
cases
such
as
this
would
be
the
practice
of
the
nation
as
a
whole
would
be
an
objective
reference,
and
this
really
is
quite
consistent
with
what
has
been
historically
its
approach
as
far
back
as
district
of
columbia
versus
clawans.
the
court
said
that
in
judging
the
question
of
seriousness
of
a
penalty,
this
is
page
628,
“doubts
must
be
resolved
not
subjectively
by
recourse
of
the
judge
to
his
own
sympathy
and
emotions,
but
by
objective
standards
such
as
may
be
observed
in
the
laws
and
practices
of
the
community,
taken
as
a
gauge
of
its
social
and
ethical
judgments.”
well,
if
we
look
at
section
2401
of
the
united
states
code,
for
example,
we
find
that
it's
quite
clear
that
congress
has
made
that
the
--
has
made
the
provisions
of
the
federal
probation
act
applicable
to
petty
offenses.
and,
if
we
look
at
the
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
and
to
others
as
well,
but
to
petty
offenses
in
particular
which
is
the
question
here.
that
is,
i
take
it,
the
question
is
whether
this
is
too
serious
a
punishment.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
the
question.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
to
probation
or
to
jail?
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
any
sentence
to
jail
in
excess
of
six
months
in
a
contempt
case,
under
this
court's
ruling
in
cheff
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
would
be
improper.
i
don't
believe
i
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
excuse
me?
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
yes,
but
i
believe
that
--
your
honor,
that
that
question
--
well,
let
me
put
it
another
way,
if
i
may.
let
us
suppose
that
mr.
frank,
in
this
case,
had
been
sentenced
not
to
three
years
on
probation
but
had
been
sentenced
to
six
months
of
hard
labor
on
the
rock
pile
of
maximum
security
prison
with
solitary
confinement
and
a
diet
of
a
disciplinary
standard.
i
don't
suppose
that
we
would
be
in
a
very
good
position
coming
in
here
to
argue
to
this
court
that,
while
that
sentence
fit
within
the
six
month
standard
which
this
court
had
announced
in
cheff,
because
it's
not
only
the
duration
of
a
sentence
which
may
indicate
what
its
seriousness
is,
but,
again,
i
think
the
main
point
is
that
this
court
has
indicated,
and
quite
properly
so,
that
it
will
make
up
its
mind
on
these
issues
by
referring
to
national
practice
rather
than
to
its
own
feelings
about
the
issue.
and,
national
practice
in
the
first
instance,
the
federal
probation
act
in
the
second
instance,
the
survey
of
state
laws
which
we
had
made
in
our
brief,
that
seems
to
us,
indicate
that
a
three
year
term
of
probation
for
a
minor
offense
is
not
at
all
out
of
the
ordinary.
yes?
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
if
--
if
it
might
be
a
sentence
of
three
years
in
jail.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
think
there's
no
question
but
that,
under
this
court's
holdings
last
term,
that
would
be
an
improper
judgment.
that
is,
in
part,
why
i
said
at
the
beginning
of
the
argument
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
six
months.
our
position
is
that
once
cheff
was
decided,
the
effect
of
that
decision
was
to
impose
a
maximum
limitation
on
federal
judges
sitting
in
contempt
cases
where
there's
denying
of
jury
trial.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well,
i
know
i
wouldn't
take
that
position,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
would
say,
under
cheff,
that's
improper,
but
i
also
say,
under
cheff,
that
once
a
judge
has
denied
jury
trial,
if
he
then
at
least
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
goes
on
without
giving
indication
that
he
is
--
does
not
understand
that
opinion,
once
he
has
denied
a
jury
trial,
he
has
limit
himself
to
six
months.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
that's
right.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
that
is
a
possibility,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well,
i'm
not
sure
that
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
agree
that
that's
a
problem.
i'm
not
sure
that
the
court's
--
i'm
not
sure
that
the
court's
opinion
resolved
that
problem.
i
did
have
the
chance
to
look
at
some
statistics
on
that
question
and,
in
the
same
--
which
may
be
relevant,
in
the
same
report
of
the
administrative
office
of
us
courts
regarding
persons
under
supervision
in
the
federal
probation
system,
which
we
cite
with
respect
to
commission
or
practice,
it
gives
some
indication
of
the
incidence
of
removals
from
probation,
and
it
shows
that,
generally
speaking,
only
one
out
of
every
seven
probationers
is
ever
removed.
so
that
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
and,
he
wouldn't
have
to
give
six
months.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
he
could
give
less.
so
that,
while
we
agree
that
that
possibility
is
something
which
ought
to
be
taken
into
account
in
assessing
the
seriousness,
i
don't
think
it
should
be
made
conclusive.
we
would,
in
effect,
be
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
yes?
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
yes,
i
believe
there
is.
i
believe
it's
found
in
the
federal
probation
act
in
section
3651
of
that
act.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
yes,
upon
entering
a
judgment
of
conviction
of
any
offense
not
punishable
by
death
or
life
imprisonment,
and
it
continues,
any
court
having
jurisdiction
to
try
offenses
against
the
united
states,
of
course
that
includes
petty
offenses,
may
suspend
the
imposition
or
execution
of
sentence.
and,
i
think
this
case,
for
exam
--
this
court,
for
example,
in
the
case
of
roberts
versus
united
states,
which
i
believe
is
in
342
us
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
drew
that
distinction.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i'm
not
sure
i
follow,
your
honor.
he
could
be
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
right.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
the
judge
in
this
particular
circumstance
may
revoke
probation,
although
he's
not
required
to
do
so.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
where,
in
this
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
he
then
proceeds
to
sentence
which
he
has
previously
suspended.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
he
had
suspended
the
imposition
of
the
sentence.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
no,
i
take
it,
that
would
require
--
if
it
were
a
penal
offense,
that
would
require
a
criminal
trial
in
itself.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
that's
right.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
that's
right.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
we
think
that
would
affirmatively
show
that
he
had
misunderstood
this
court's
ruling
in
cheff.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
or
that
he
had
determined
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well,
i
take
it,
your
honor,
that
if
that
should
ever
occur
to
a
judge
in
the
course
of
a
trial
of
a
contempt
he
had
thought
would
be
petty,
what
he
would
probably
do
would
be
to
declare
a
mistrial
at
that
point.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
and
convene
a
jury.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
that's
section
3651
of
title
18.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
may
it
please
the
court.
i
should,
perhaps
for
a
minute,
discuss
section
3691
of
title
18
since
counsel
raised
the
question.
this
was
one
of
the
principle
grounds
for
argument
in
the
court
below,
although
it
was
not
raised
in
the
certiorari
petition.
and,
basically,
the
question
there,
as
i
think
counsel
recognized,
is
whether
this
was
an
action
brought
by
or
on
behalf
of
the
united
states
or
not.
if
it
was
not
brought
on
behalf
of
the
united
states,
a
jury
trial
was
required
under
that
section.
if
it
was
brought
on
behalf
of
the
united
states,
a
jury
was
not
required.
in
fact,
the
civil
action
was
brought
in
the
name
of
the
securities
and
exchange
commission,
an
independent
agency
of
the
united
states
government,
so
that,
the
argument
would
be
that
an
action
brought
by
that
agency
was
not
one
brought
on
behalf
of
the
united
states.
very
briefly,
i
think,
the
legislative
history
of
the
provision,
which
has
been
before
the
court
before,
makes
it
plain
that
none
of
the
sponsors
thought
they
were
distinguishing
between
actions
involving
the
united
states
and
actions
involving
one
of
its
agencies.
the
principal
concern
of
the
statute
was
with
the
use
of
injunctions
and
labor
cases
between
private
parties
to
press
one
side
of
the
dispute,
and
remarks
were
made
to
the
effect
that
the
enactment
left
all
powers
that
exist
in
the
government
at
present,
undisturbed
by
its
passage.
there
is
no
extensive
case
along
the
subject
principally
because
i
think
all
courts
to
which
the
question
has
been
presented
have
treated
it
summarily,
as
did
the
tenth
circuit
below,
simply
stating
that,
of
course,
an
action
brought
by
an
agency
of
the
united
states
was
one
brought
on
behalf
of
the
united
states.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
no
one
asked,
but
i
thought
i
should
make
that
clear.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
the
contempt
action
was
brought
by
the
--
an
attorney
for
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
and
the
united
states
attorney
acting
together
and,
as
it
was
a
criminal
action,
i
suppose
it
would
be
under
the
caption
“united
states
versus
frank,”
but
the
original
con
--
the
original
injunction
which
is
what
would
be
relevant
to
3691
was
brought
in
the
name
of
the
securities
and
exchange
commission.
well,
as
i
was
saying
before
lunch
hour,
we
feel
that
the
basic
mode
of
decision
as
to
the
comparative
seriousness
of
the
probation
in
this
case
was
set
out
by
this
court
last
term
in
bloom
and
earlier
than
that
in
clawans,
that
is,
the
consultation
of
the
laws
and
practices
of
the
nation
to
see
what
comparisons
have
been
drawn.
in
general
and
as
we
set
out
in
our
brief,
we
did
attempt
such
a
study.
it
was
a
study
complicated
by
the
substantial
variants
which
this
court
noted
last
term
in
state
practice
regarding
the
affording
of
jury
trials
with
the
sorts
of
offenses
that
concerns
us
here.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
so.
our
point
is
that
the
question
of
equivalency
is
primarily
a
legislative
judgment
and
that
if
we
can
show
that
the
judgment
made
by
one
legislature,
in
this
case,
the
congress,
it
is
within
the
general
scope
of
the
laws
and
practices
of
the
nation
as
a
whole,
then,
that
is
sufficient
to
defend
the
judgment.
in
fact,
it
seems
to
me
that
it
might
be
the
converse
if
you
asked
about
the
particular
probation
imposed
in
a
particular
case.
you
might
get
into
just
the
problem
which
concerns
you.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
no,
i
think
i
was
trying
to
make
a
slightly
different
point.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well,
from
this
perspective,
looking
at
the
national
scheme
as
a
whole,
we
think
the
results
are
quiet
striking.
there
are
only
12
jurisdictions
which
limit
the
probation
term
to
the
same
extent
as
penal
terms.
on
the
other
hand,
15
provide,
as
does
the
federal
statute,
for
a
maximum
period
of
probation
of
5
years
without
regard
to
the
offense
committed.
there
are
nine
--
nine
jurisdictions
in
which
the
question
is
left
to
the
court's
discretion
and
the
remainder
provided
for
maximum
between
one
and
three
years
with
the
great
majority
in
the
upper
half
of
that
reign.
while
we
were
able
to
supply
the
court
with
figures
regarding
the
practice
of
united
states
commissioners
in
probation
cases,
which
indicates
that
they
regularly
imposed
probation
sentences
or
probation
terms,
i
should
say,
in
excess
of
six
months,
of
course
is
the
limit
of
their
authority
under
--
as
far
as
jail
sentences
are
concerned
under
the
code.
we
have
been
unable
to
obtain
such
figures
for
the
nation
as
a
whole,
but
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
no,
i'm
still
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
believe
his
question
was
whether
i
would
regard
it
differently
if
the
probation
period
was
10
years.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
yes.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
there's
no
statutory
authorization
that
i'm
aware
of
for
such
a
term.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
yes.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
yes,
i
would.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
no,
i
do
not
regard
five
years
is
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
would
regard
eight
years
is
different.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
regard
six
years
as
different.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
the
point
is,
as
this
court
admonished
last
term
in
the
bloom
case,
that
we
are
to
look
to
the
nation's
law
and
practices.
looking
to
the
nation's
law
in
--
nation's
law
and
practices,
we
find
irregular
legislative
practice
of
authorizing
probation
terms
up
to
five
years
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
for
education.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
yes.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
but,
i
think
that
question
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well,
i
think
the
reason
is
important,
your
honor.
what
i've
been
trying
to
do
is
to
apply
those
tests
which
the
court
set
out
last
term.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well,
it's
true,
your
honor,
that
i
have
assumed
that
the
constitutional
questions
which
were
decided
last
term
in
bloom
and
duncan
were
the
questions
which,
principally,
would
be
decided
in
connection
with
what
i
agree
is,
strictly
speaking,
a
question
of
cheff
versus
schnackenberg
which
was
not,
as
stated,
a
constitutional
decision.
and,
what
i
have
been
trying
to
do
is
to
present
the
case
in
terms
of
the
criteria
that
the
court
stated
it
would
look
to
in
deciding
the
constitutional
question
and
those
criteria
were,
in
the
words
of
the
court,
objective
criteria,
chiefly,
the
existing
laws
and
practices
of
the
state.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well
--
mr.
peter
l.

alright,
there
may
be
--
there
are
perhaps
several
ways
in
which
i
can
answer
that.
one
is,
there
is
a
basic
statutory
authorization
involved
here,
section
3401
of
title
18,
which,
as
we
have
indicated,
is
an
authorization
which
is
frequently
used
by
united
states
commissioners.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
for
petty
offenses,
necessarily.
over
50%
of
the
petty
offense
probation
terms
are
in
excess
of
six
months,
over
25%
are
in
excess
of
one
year.
so
that,
in
fact
and
in
practice,
there
is
statutory
and
practical
authorization
for
this
practice.
the
second
argument,
it's
a
policy
argument,
if
that
makes
any
difference,
has
to
do
with
the
nature
of
probation
itself.
while
it
is
backed
up
by
the
threat
of
punishment,
to
be
sure,
a
probation
is
not
a
punitive
device
and
i
do
not
believe
that
anyone
subjected
to
probation
views
it
as
such.
that
is,
if
he
has
his
choice,
he
takes
the
probation
and,
in
effect,
as
i'm
sure
the
court
appreciates,
any
defendant
preferring
to
go
to
jail
for
six
months
would
be
able
to
do
so.
even
if
the
law
didn't
authorize
him
to
refuse
the
conditions
of
probation,
he
could
simply
announce
to
the
court
“well,
i'm
going
out
and
first
thing
i'm
going
to
do
is
to
disobey
them.”
so
that,
in
practical
terms,
if
one
is
talking
about
an
alternative
which
is
somewhat
within
the
defendant's
control.
as
this
court
has
recognized
in
the
past,
probation
is
a
rehabilitative
device
and
is
--
it's
designed
--
really,
the
decision
is
to
how
long
it
should
be
is
made
on
the
basis
of
rehabilitative
considerations.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
if
i
may
respond
to
that,
your
honor,
i
see
my
time
is
up.
that
is
a
theory,
but
it's
only
a
part
of
the
theory
as
to
imprisonment
and
legislatures,
frankly,
vary
the
amount
of
imprisonment
they
provide
for
crimes
in
direct
relationship
to
their
view
of
the
seriousness
of
the
of
crime
involved,
and
that's
not
done
in
general
with
respect
to
probation.
so
that,
we
submit,
that
probation
in
this
case
was
authorized
by
statute.
it
meets
the
tests
which
the
court
set
out
last
terms
in
duncan
and
bloom.
it
was
an
appropriate
disposition
for
this
case
and,
consequently,
the
judgment
below
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
yes?
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
suppose
it
would
have
to
be
less
than
that,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
you'd
have
a
sort
of
declining
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
enforcement
demise.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
you
couldn't
do
that.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
no,
you
couldn't.
