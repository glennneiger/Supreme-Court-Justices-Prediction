mr.

--
justice
abe
fortas
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
strauss,
is
there
explicit
authority
for
suspending
the
imposition
of
sentence?
explicit
authority,
i
know
it's
done.
justice
abe
fortas
for
suspending
the
imposition
of
sentence?
the
imposition
of
sentence,
i
should've
--
justice
abe
fortas
right--
right
justice
abe
fortas
now,
let
us
suppose
that
this
petitioner
violated
probation.
then,
i
suppose
he
could
come
in
and
one
of
two
things
could
happen,
couldn't
they?
either
the
sentenced
could
be
imposed
at
that
time
under
the
reserved
power
or
he
could
be
punished
for
violation
of
probation.
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
what
could've
--
suppose
the
petitioner
violated
the
probation?
he
just
didn't
report
when
he
was
supposed
to
report
or
he
went
out
and
robbed
a
bank.
justice
abe
fortas
by
--
in
violation
of
the
terms
of
his
probation.
he
is
brought
in
before
the
judge.
now,
what
can
the
judge
do?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
what
happened?
what
is
the
consequence
of
revoking
probation?
justice
abe
fortas
here,
right
here
under
this
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
he
hadn't
susp
--
he
suspended
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
imposition
of
the
sentence.
now,
can
he
also
punish
him
for
violating
the
probation?
justice
abe
fortas
so
the
only
thing
that
he
can
do
at
that
time
is
to
impose
sentence
for
the
initial
offense?
justice
abe
fortas
and,
it's
your
theory
then
that
the
most
he
could
impose
then
would
be
six
months
in
jail?
justice
abe
fortas
i
suppose
that,
i
think
mr.
justice
asked
you
this
and
--
but
if
he
used
a
different
form
of
sentence
and
imposed
--
judgment
and
imposed
the
sentence
of
three
years
and
then
suspended
it,
you
say
the
consequences
would
be
different
and
that,
then,
he
was
--
he
would
have
to
retry
it.
justice
abe
fortas
or
that
he
had
--
justice
abe
fortas
had
decided
that
it
was
--
this
was
more
than
a
petty
offense
is
more
punishment
than
six
months?
justice
abe
fortas
and
then
convene
a
jury.
justice
abe
fortas
do
i
understand
you,
mr.
strauss,
to
say
in
response
to
a
question
by
mr.
justice
black,
that
if
the
probation
period
here
had
been
five
years,
it
might
--
you
might
regard
it
differently?
justice
abe
fortas
so
i
as
i
mistaken
in
that?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
would
you?
justice
abe
fortas
if
there
were
--
justice
abe
fortas
no,
but
--
forget
that.
let's
suppose
that
there
were
not
limitation
whatever
on
the
length
of
time
of
the
probation.
would
you
regard
10
years
as
--
justice
abe
fortas
and
as
a
different
in
--
justice
abe
fortas
the
purposes
of
our
problem.
how
about
five
years?
justice
abe
fortas
how
about
eight
years.
justice
abe
fortas
six?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
then,
i
don't
get
you.
justice
abe
fortas
but
the
question
is
--
justice
abe
fortas
that
doesn't
answer
the
question.
the
question
here
is
whether
the
--
a
three
year
probation
period
should
be
assimilated
to
the
six
month
petty
offense
concept
in
cheff
against
schnackenberg.
would
you
agree
that
that's
the
question?
justice
abe
fortas
before
us?
justice
abe
fortas
and
then
now
you,
if
i
correctly
understand
you,
you
said
you
would
assimilate
five
years
to
it.
for
whatever
reason,
you
would
assimilate
five
years
to
it
but
you
would
not
assimilate
six
years
to
it.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
know,
but
those
are
not
tests
of
what
is
and
what's
not
a
--
to
be
regarded
as
a
petty
offense
for
purposes
of
contempt.
what
you're
calling
our
attention
to
is
nothing
more
than
the
maximum
period
for
a
probation
order.
now,
that
assumes
what
i
--
what
may
be
a
question
that
we
have
to
decide,
whether
a
probation
order,
provided
it's
for
a
permissible
period,
is
to
be
regarded
as
a
--
in
effect,
a
sentence
that
is
no
more
deserving
of
jury
consideration
than
a
petty
offense.
justice
abe
fortas
and,
i
--
it
seems
to
me,
that
comparison,
that
reference
to
the
maximum
permitted
time
for
--
upon
which
a
person
may
be
placed
on
probation
does
not
provide
us
with
a
guide
for
this
purpose,
which
is,
shall
the
six
months
--
shall
the
three
year
probation
here
be
assimilated
to
the
six
months
sentence,
six
months
imprisonment,
in
called
petty
offense
for
purposes
of
cheff
against
schnackenberg.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
your
ad
--
i
know,
but
your
adversary
points
out
that
this
man,
during
the
period
of
his
probation,
is
required
to
report
every
monday,
he's
required
to
notify
the
authorities
when
he
changes
jobs,
he
--
if
he's
--
i
suppose,
if
he's
arrested
for
whatever
offense,
then
his
whole
probation
is
in
danger.
got
to
be
careful
not
to
spit
on
the
sidewalk
or
things
of
that
sort.
isn't
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
and
the
question
is
whether
that
is
or
is
not
to
be
regarded
as
in
the
same
light
as
a
petty
offense
as
defined
in
cheff
against
schnakenberg
and
in
the
statute
for
purposes
of
a
jury
trial
in
a
contempt
case.
justice
abe
fortas
and
the
referee
--
even
if
the
states
all
permitted
probation
without
limit,
i
don't
think
that
would
settle
it,
just
as
if
it
wouldn't
settle
it
in
my
mind
if
the
state
said
that
“two
years
is
a
maximum
amount.”
justice
abe
fortas
for
petty
offenses.
justice
abe
fortas
that's
a
theory
about
prison,
too.
it
may
be
kind
of
whimsical,
but
it
is
a
theory
as
to
reason
why
we
put
people
in
jail,
isn't
it?
it's
a
deterrent
to
them
and
to
others,
and
as

what
is
called
a

for

of
