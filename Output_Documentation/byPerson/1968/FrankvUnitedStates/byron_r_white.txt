justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
that,
act
of
congress,
a
judge
is
permitted
to,
not
to
sentence
but
just
to
put
on
probation,
may
suspend
sentencing
and
just
put
a
fellow
on
probation?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
does
say
--
it
does
distinguish
between
suspending
the
imposition
it's
in
and
the
execution.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
there's
really
no
difference
between
these?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
familiar
with
mensa
v.
ray?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
that,
there,
the
district
court
recognized
that
the
constitution
requires
a
judge
might,
in
conclusion
of
a
criminal
case,
have
to
suspend
the
imposition
of
sentence,
that
is,
postponing
sentencing
to
put
the
man
on
probation.
and,
that
if
he
then
violated
the
probation
and
he
had
another
proceeding
to
effect
the
imposed
sentence,
that's
actually
the
sentencing
then.
what
happens
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
three
years
on
probation?
justice
byron
r.
white
didn't
the
ju
--
you
did
not
know
how
long
this
in
turn
will
be
if
he
violates
--
this
gentleman
violates
these
probations,
and
then
the
judge
comes
in
and
he
comes
back
before
the
judge,
do
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
did
not
say
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
just
as
a
prior
judge,
do
you
think
that
if
you've
never
sent
one
to
jail
where
he's
going
to
be
and
the
man
violates
his
probation
and
he
comes
back
to
court,
you'll
want
to
throw
him
out
of
court
for
his
probation
violation.
you
then
have
to
make
up
your
mind
how
much
of
the
jail
time
you're
going
to
invoke.
justice
byron
r.
white
and,
suppose
the
judge
had
sentenced
three
years
by
suspension?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
i
ask
you
that
personally.
well,
i
take
it,
under
this
sentence
of
probation,
suppose
he
bartered
in
a
way
that
the
sentencing
judge
has
taken
the
analogy
that
that
was
the
sentence.
how
long
would
he
sentence
him?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that
if
--
that,
until
the
judge
actually
sentences,
imposes
the
jail
sentence,
you
don't
know
how
serious
he
considered
the
offense
to
be.
justice
byron
r.
white
and,
if
he
had
imposed
for
cont
--
a
cont
--
a
sentence
for
contempt
of
two
years
in
jail
and
then
suspended
it,
you
would
say
that,
under
cheff,
that's
improper.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
agree.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
strauss.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you're
going
to
count
probation
as
equivalent
to
sentence
or
as
a
prison
term,
i
suppose
that
if
you
suspended
imposition
of
sentence,
you
could
--
and
was
going
to
put
a
man
on
probation,
you
could
only
put
him
on
probation
for
six
months,
if
you
were
going
to
count
probation
as
equivalent
to
prison
terms?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
would
have
to
be
less
than
that,
either
that
or,
if
at
the
end
of
five
months
he
violated
his
probation
and
he
came
in
for
his
sentence,
he'd
only
be
sentenced
for
a
month.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
right
and
if
you
--
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
actually
sentenced
him
to
six
months,
imposed
the
six
months
sentence,
and
then
if
you
wanted
to
suspend
execution
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
said
you
couldn't
do
that.
justice
byron
r.

yes,
thank
you.
