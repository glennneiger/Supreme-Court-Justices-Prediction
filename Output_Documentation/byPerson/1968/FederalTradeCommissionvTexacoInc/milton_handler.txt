mr.
milton
handler
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
--
mr.
milton
handler
please
the
court.
when
the
1965
following
the
court's
decision
in
atlantic,
your
honors
remanded
this
case
to
the
commission
for
reconsideration
in
the
light
of
the
principles
laid
down
in
atlantic,
it
was
perfectly
plain
that
as
it
is
now
that
texaco
was
a
large
company
engaged
in
the
sale
of
petroleum
products
to
its
dealers
that
goodrich
is
a
large
tire
company
and
the
business
of
selling
tba
items
that
texaco's
leases
and
sales
agreements
with
its
dealers
are
of
short
duration
and
that
texaco's
dealers
purchase
substantial
quantities
of
the
sponsored
goodrich
tba.
if
it
had
been
your
honors'
intention
therefore
in
atlantic
to
hold
that
the
sales-commission
agreement
and
these
circumstances
as
per
se
unlawful.
there
would
have
been
no
point
in
remanding
our
case
for
application
of
atlantic
to
the
facts
of
record
here.
all
that
was
needed
--
mr.
milton
handler
that
may
be
your
honor,
but
the
order
of
the
courts
says,
remand
for
application
of
the
principles
of
atlantic.
and
if
there
was
per
se
illegality
although
it
was
necessary
to
--
was
to
enter
a
final
order
of
reinstating
the
commission's
order.
we
do
not
read
atlantic
as
adopting
a
rule
of
per
se
illegality.
this
was
not
the
ground
upon
which
my
good
friend
and
former
student
mr.
friedman
argued
atlantic.
mr.
milton
handler
i
think
it
took
extremely
well,
your
honor.
he's
one
of
the
most
distinguished
graduates
of
our
school.
on
oral
argument,
he
emphatically
declared
and
i
quote
“the
government
does
not
suggest
that
there
may
not
be
commission
sales
agreements
which
would
satisfy
section
5.”
he
squarely
recognized
and
again
i
quote,
“that
there
may
very
well
be
situations
where
eliminating
some
of
the
things
they
namely,
atlantic
and
goodyear
did
in
this
case
would
not
have
the
same
adverse
effect
on
the
competition
as
the
plan,
the
commission
condemn.”
he
repeatedly
in
response
to
the
questions
from
the
court
disclaimed
a
per
se
theory
of
the
legality.
and
no
claim
of
per
se
unlawfulness
was
made
in
the
government's
brief
in
atlantic.
more
importantly,
mr.
justice
clark's
opinion
does
not
hold
that
the
mere
existence
of
superior
economic
power
in
the
oil
company
be
with
its
dealers
results
in
illegality.
the
opinion
makes
clear
that
the
gravamen
of
the
violation
consist
of
the
misused
of
that
power
with
concomitant
anticompetitive
results.
in
a
nutshell,
the
commission's
order
in
atlantic
was
upheld
because
the
oil
company,
and
i'm
quoting
now
from
mr.
justice
clark,
“marshaled
its
full
economic
power
in
a
continuing
campaign
to
force
its
dealers
and
wholesalers
to
buy
goodyear
products.”
and
that
rational
was
precisely
the
one
that
the
government
advanced
in
its
brief
to
this
court
and
again,
i
quote,
“in
some,
atlantic
marshaled
the
full
measure
of
its
economic
power
over
its
dealers
to
carryout
a
pressure
campaign
designed
to
get
them
to
handle
goodyear
and
firestone
products
and
because
of
the
extent
of
that
power,
the
campaign
was
highly
successful.”
mr.
milton
handler
what's
that
--
mr.
milton
handler
i'm
going
to
go
into
that
your
honor.
i'd
wanted
to
clear
the
way
that
your
honors
did
not
hold
it
sales-commission
was
per
se
unlawful.
therefore,
its
validity
depends
upon
the
facts
and
i
want
to
go
into
the
facts
to
show
that
the
facts
here
do
not
want
the
application
of
atlantic
because
the
facts
are
totally
different.
mr.
milton
handler
well,
your
honors
say
--
the
--
mr.
milton
handler
what
was
that?
your
honors
remanded
the
case
for
the
application
of
atlantic
to
the
facts
of
this
case.
that's
what
your
mandate
said
and
mr.
friedman
has
acknowledged
in
response
to
a
question
that
atlantic
does
not
control
and
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
atlantic
was
not
controlling
because
the
facts
were
different
and
that's
why
it's
one
of
the
reasons
why
it
set
aside
the
order
of
the
commission.
now,
why
is
this
case
your
honors
different
from
the
other
two?
this
case
is
different
because
texaco
unlike
atlantic
and
shell
did
not
wilt
its
economic
power
to
interfere
with
the
freedom
of
choice
of
its
dealers.
twice
has
the
court
of
appeals
so
found
after
careful
review
of
this
bulky
sixth
volume
record
applying
the
same
principles
as
those
established
in
atlantic
and
enforced
in
shell
by
the
fifth
circuit.
the
court
below
found
that
the
texaco
dealers
were
entirely
free
to
handle
the
tba
of
their
own
choice
without
any
interference
whatsoever
on
the
part
of
texaco.
it
found
that
it
is
been
texaco's
policy
to
respect
the
independence
of
its
dealers
and
that
its
practices
have
matched
that
policy.
this
was
the
testimony
of
literality
scores
of
witnesses.
many
call
to
the
stand
by
the
commission
itself.
it's
our
submission
your
honors
that
a
plan
which
leaves
dealers
entirely
free
to
accept
or
to
reject
sponsored
products
cannot
produce
any
anticompetitive
effect
and
unless
the
court
adopts
a
doctrine
of
per
se
illegality
cannot
be
found
to
be
unlawful
and
that
was
why
i
started
my
argument
by
trying
to
point
out
that
the
court
had
not
in
the
prior
case
to
reach
any
conclusions
as
to
per
se
illegality.
mr.
milton
handler
i'm
delighted
to
answer
that
your
honor.
the
commission
asked
texaco
to
compile
certain
information
which
it
did.
the
commission
offered
this
evidence
itself.
this
evidence
showed
that
less
than
one-third
of
texaco
dealers
handled
any
of
the
sponsored
tires
and
only
about
one-fifth
handled
the
sponsored
batteries.
this
means
that
80%
of
the
batteries
that
they
handled
were
nonsponsored
and
about
70%
of
the
tires
were
nonsponsored
and
they
handled
a
great
variety
of
other
products.
this
record
as
we
pleat
with
the
advertisements
of
250
different
tba
items
which
the
texaco
dealers
handled
and
advertised.
now,
the
curious
thing
that
we
find
about
the
government's
argument
here
is
that
it
neither
contends
for
a
rule
of
per
se
illegality
nor
does
it
make
a
frontal
attack
on
the
findings
of
the
court
of
appeals
upholding
the
freedom
of
texaco
dealers
to
handle
tba
of
their
own
choice.
instead,
in
its
brief,
the
solicitor
general
appears
to
be
propounding
a
brand
new
theory
of
liability.
i
might
say
this
case
has
been
before
this
court
twice,
before
the
court
of
appeals
twice,
before
the
commission
three
times
and
each
time
that
i've
appeared,
i've
been
confronted
with
a
new
theory
of
the
legality.
before
i
address
myself
to
the
new
theory,
i'd
like
to
with
your
honors
permission
underscore
what
is
not
involved
in
this
case
as
mr.
friedman
pointed
out,
we're
not
confronted
here
with
coercion
that's
out
of
the
case
nor
does
the
case
involved
any
claim
of
a
tie-in.
that
argument
was
made
before
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
first
ground
and
it
was
rejected
because
it's
unsupported
by
the
facts
and
it
has
never
been
devoured.
mr.
milton
handler
i'm
sorry
i
don't
hear
you
mr.
justice.
mr.
milton
handler
well,
i'll
accept
that
your
honor
for
purposes
of
the
argument.
the
coercion
order,
the
two
provisions
of
the
coercion
order
have
been
stricken
and
the
government
has
agreed
to
have
them
stricken
and
i
will
point
out
that
there
is
no
nothing
that
resembles
any
kind
of
coercion
whether
it
would
overt
or
implied
or
covered.
there's
just
nothing
in
this
record
that
will
support
any
such
conclusion.
mr.
milton
handler
no,
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
texaco
had
dominant
power.
we
disagree
but
that
issue
is
not
before
that
court.
mr.
milton
handler
what
was
that?
mr.
milton
handler
we
think
that
dominant
power
means
the
power
to
force
people
to
do
something
against
their
will.
mr.
milton
handler
that
is
correct
and
this
record
establishes
the
correctness
of
that
conclusion.
mr.
milton
handler
that
is
correct.
mr.
milton
handler
that
is
correct.
the
nature
of
this
agreement
--
mr.
milton
handler
that
is
correct.
we
say
power
--
mr.
milton
handler
that's
our
submission
your
honor
that
power
plus
salesmanship
does
not
add
up
to
illegality.
mr.
milton
handler
i
would
deny
that
we
have
any
kind
of
a
touch.
i
deny
empathically
and
i
don't
think
this
record
will
establish
that
we
have
any
touch.
and
i
will
now
explain
why.
i
was
trying
to
put
aside
the
things
that
are
not
involved
in
the
case.
there's
no
claim
here
that
we
agreed
with
goodrich
that
we've
require
our
dealers
to
handle
their
products.
finally,
there's
no
longer
of
any
claim
here
that
texaco
in
fact
required
its
dealers
to
handle
the
sponsored
tba.
that
was
the
basis
upon
which
all
of
the
prior
decisions
rest
the
requirement.
indeed,
in
this
petition
for
certiorari,
the
government
said
that
the
court
of
appeals
conclusion
that
the
texaco
dealers
were
free
to
charge
nonsponsored
--
to
choose
nonsponsored
tba
is
irrelevant.
our
submission
is
that
that
fact
the
dealer
freedom
of
choice
is
not
only
irrelevant,
it
is
decisive.
mr.
milton
handler
your
honor,
i
will
answer
that
specific
incident
and
then
i'm
going
to
review
other
incidents
in
this
record
which
led
the
court
of
appeals
to
say
that
this
finding
of
the
commission
with
respect
to
the
supplier
testimony
was
not
supported
by
the
retroact.
in
the
case
of
mr.
--
mr.
milton
handler
what's
that?
mr.
milton
handler
yes,
i'm
going
to
answer
that.
mr.
milton
handler
mr.
tidwell
as
my
good
friend
points
out
had
the
conversation
with
the
dealer,
with
the
salesmen
which
he
asked
for
the
salesmen
advice.
now,
the
record
shows
that
tidwell
continued
to
sell
these
nonsponsored
tires
as
well
as
nonsponsored
batteries.
and
he
told
the
examiner
that
he
was
handling
firestone
because
he
preferred
to
handle
firestone.
so
we
had
dangling
in
the
air
a
conversation
which
apparently
has
no
effect
because
he
continues
to
handle
the
other
products
just
after
the
conversation
exactly
as
he
did
before.
now,
what
is
left
to
this
case?
the
government
in
its
brief
says
that
even
if
the
dealers
were
not
constrained
they
felt
that
they
were
constrained.
this,
i
think
your
honor
is
the
velvet
glove.
the
argument
is
made
that
the
texaco
dealer
though
not
in
fact
required
to
buy
a
sponsored
product.
nevertheless,
does
not
exercise
the
freedom
that
is
his
of
selecting
tba
brands
solely
on
the
basis
of
the
comparative
merits
of
the
competing
products.
the
suggestion
is
that
the
dealer
may
be
concerned
albeit
erroneously
that
texaco
would
disapprove
of
his
purchase
of
nonsponsored
tba
so
that
in
the
absence
of
strong
countervailing,
the
fact
is
the
dealer
is
most
likely
to
acquiesce
in
texaco's
recommendation
to
purchase
the
sponsored
products.
now,
i
believe
we
have
the
right
to
ask
where
in
this
record
is
the
proof
that
the
texaco
dealers
do
not
purchase
tba
on
the
basis
of
irrelative
merits
of
the
particular
brand.
where
is
the
proof
that
there
must
be
strong
countervailing
factors
before
texaco
dealers
provide
nonsponsored
products?
where
is
the
proof
that
texaco
dealers
fail
constrain
to
acquiesce
in
texaco's
recommendations?
i
should've
thought,
your
honors,
that
since
the
government's
argument
depends
on
psychoanalyzing
a
body
of
dealers,
it
would've
favored
us
with
some
words
from
the
patients
themselves.
but
the
most
amazing
part
of
this
new
theory
is
that
it
is
evoked
in
the
case
where
the
government
failed
to
call
a
single
texaco
dealer
and
texaco
has
38,000
of
them
to
testify
as
a
witness
not
one.
now,
why
should
the
government
on
appeal
after
13
years
of
litigation
now
speculate
or
make
assumptions
concerning
the
attitude
or
feelings
of
the
dealers.
the
dealers
were
at
all
times
available
as
witnesses,
they
could've
testified
as
to
what
animated
their
tba
purchases.
texaco
in
fact
produced
many
of
these,
such
witnesses
as
part
of
its
defense
case.
and
they
made
it
perfectly
plain.
some
54
of
them
but
they
were
not
pressured
and
to
anything
by
texaco
and
that
they
felt
no
constrain.
the
government
on
the
other
hand
avoided
dealer
witnesses
like
to
play.
and
we
don't
have
to
look
too
hard
for
the
reason.
i
refer
your
honors
to
volume
5
of
the
appendix
and
you
will
see
there
a
form
letter
which
counsel
to
the
commission
sent
to
texaco
dealers.
the
first
paragraph
of
which
reads,
complaints
including
one
on
the
above
entitled
matter
currently
pending
before
the
commission
are
intended
to
determine
whether
operators
of
major
oil
company
petroleum
outlets
are
independent
businessmen
with
complete
freedom
of
choice
as
to
the
products
which
they
stopped
for
resale
or
are
obliged
to
handle
products
chosen
for
them
by
the
respective
oil
companies.
and
then
in
connection
with
this
issue,
the
questionnaire
seeks
information
as
to
whether
tba
has
handled
and
what
is
the
principle
line
that
is
handled
when
they
took
on
the
line
and
similar
matters.
in
short,
in
this
questionnaire,
the
government
--
the
commission
correctly
stated
the
issue
which
was
the
issue
which
was
tried
whether
the
dealers
have
freedom
of
choice
or
whether
they
were
obliged
to
buy
the
sponsored
products.
now,
after
getting
the
facts,
elicited
by
this
question
there
what
the
commission
do.
they
decided
not
to
call
any
texaco
dealers
as
witnesses.
the
plain
implication
is
that
the
responses
to
the
question
there
did
not
support
the
charges
against
respondents.
indeed,
the
one
response
which
texaco
was
able
to
obtain
and
which
is
set
out
as
jax
428
of
the
record
at
last
page
very
clearly
why
the
dealers
were
not
put
on
the
stand
because
the
witness
indicated
that
he
was
totally
free.
now,
having
in
its
possession
facts
which
negates
its
theory
and
supported
the
defense,
the
commission
not
only
did
not
introduce
these
facts,
it
suppressed
them.
it
refused
even
to
disclose
to
texaco
the
names
of
the
persons
that
had
interviewed.
now,
after
withholding
evidence
that
the
texaco
dealers
do
not
feel
constrain
to
buy
the
sponsored
tba
i
submit
that
the
government
is
highly
in
the
position
to
ask
this
court
now
to
make
the
assumptions
upon
which
its
present
argument
rest.
now,
mr.
justice
douglas
in
brady
against
maryland
quotes
from
former
solicitor
general
sobeloff,
an
addressed
that
he
made
and
which
he
said,
“my
client's
chief
business
is
not
to
achieve
victory
but
to
establish
justice.”
and
i
must
regretfully
state
to
this
court
the
model
of
the
commission
is
precisely
the
reversed
as
this
sorted
and
supported
record
demonstrates
and
has
--
as
does
the
history
of
this
litigation.
now,
certainly
the
hearsay
testimony
of
a
few
wholesalers
does
not
remedy
the
deficiency
of
the
government's
case.
these
wholesalers
testified
they
were
told
by
some
particular
texaco
dealer
who
decline
to
buy
nonsponsored
tba
from
them
but
he
couldn't
do
so
because
texaco
might
disapprove.
quite
apart
from
the
inherently
unreliable
nature
of
this
hearsay,
the
wholesalers
themselves
on
this
record
acknowledged
their
potential
customers
may
convene
excuses
for
not
buying.
the
testimony
was
overwhelmingly
rebutted
as
the
court
below
found
but
the
record
as
a
whole.
let
me
give
you
---
mr.
milton
handler
the
contract
is
very
brief.
the
record
establishes
that
it
cost
texaco
70%
of
the
commissions
that
it
receives.
it
has
38,000
dealers.
it's
acting
as
a
sales
representative.
goodrich
does
not
have
enough
salesmen
to
visit
all
of
38,000
accounts.
the
dealers
are
versed
in
the
art
of
pumping
gasoline
out
of
the
pumps.
tba
is
a
difficult
technical
business,
they
have
to
be
trained.
inventory
control
was
very
difficult,
there
are
all
kinds
of
sizes,
all
kinds
of
products.
they
have
to
be
trained
on
installation.
texaco
had
to
build
facilities
to
store
the
tba.
texaco
permits
its
credit
cards
to
be
used
guarantying
payment
and
the
dealer
is
not
charge
for
any
of
these
services.
texaco
was
performing
the
service
as
a
sales
representative
in
exchange
for
receiving
commissions.
mr.
milton
handler
they
engaged
in
salesmanship
and
promotion
of
these
products.
mr.
milton
handler
there
may
be
an
ambiguity
when
your
honors
speaks
of
selling,
they're
not
selling
in
a
normal
sense
of
taking
the
line
and
try
to
get
the
dealer.
they
--
the
selling
is
done
by
goodrich
but
they
will
instruct
the
dealer
on
how
to
merchandise
his
product
and
there's
no
doubt
about
it
that
they
recommend
that
the
dealer
handle
the
sponsored
lines
if
he
wants
to.
mr.
milton
handler
it's
available
if
any
kind
of
tba.
mr.
milton
handler
the
dealers
have
signs
of
all
kinds
and
they
have
signs
of
tba
--
they
have
the
signs
of
firestone
and
goodrich.
mr.
milton
handler
no,
that's
done
by
goodrich
or
firestone
itself.
mr.
milton
handler
that's
correct.
mr.
milton
handler
that's
correct.
mr.
milton
handler
with
one
amendment,
you
first
stated
the
jugular
issue
your
honor.
you
got
to
add
without
any
proof
of
any
anticompetitive
effects
such
as
were
found
in
atlantic
and
in
shell.
bear
in
mind
that
these
three
cases
were
decided
by
the
commission
at
the
same
time
on
the
same
day.
it's
not
only
the
court
of
appeals
which
is
twice
found
that
this
record
would
not
support
an
order.
the
first
commission
simultaneously
with
the
issuance
of
orders
against
atlantic
and
shell
held
that
this
record
was
not
sufficient
to
warrant
an
order
against
texaco
and
remanded
the
case
to
the
hearing
examiner
to
go
into
the
question
of
anticompetitive
effect
a
vital
factor
--
a
critical
factor
which
was
lacking.
and
the
--
there
was
a
sham
remand
we
tried
to
enjoin
in
the
courts
because
the
very
anticompetitive
effects
which
the
commission
found
lacking
we're
allege
in
the
complaint.
so
that
the
counsel
for
the
complainant
for
the
commission
had
had
ample
opportunity
after
several
years
of
investigation,
and
several
years
of
trial
to
prove
these
facts
behind
them.
we
said,
he
didn't
have
them
and
we
couldn't
prove
them.
we
wanted
the
court
to
enjoin
the
hearing.
the
commission
of
representative
solemnly
told
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
that
it
had
new
evidence.
we
came
back
for
a
hearing,
they
offered
nothing.
what
they
did
was
violative
of
the
law
of
evidence.
they
took
judicial
notice
the
facts
were
in
the
other
records.
the
commission
then
said,
this
was
improper
and
it
has
excluded
all
of
the
remand
evidence
as
improper
so
that
the
record
today
as
just
as
deficient
now
as
it
was
the
first
time
it
came
before
the
commission.
now,
our
submission
justice
fortas
is
that
assuming
we're
a
large
company,
assuming
though
anticompetitive
effects,
assuming
that
all
that
you
have
is
that
a
large
amount
of
tba
sponsored
as
so
and
assuming
that
we
got
a
commission
70%
--
which
adds
up
to
a
lot
of
money
where
a
big
company
70%
of
which
represented
our
cost
we
say
that
this
is
not
a
violation
of
the
federal
trade
commission
case.
that's
our
case
in
a
nutshell.
now
if
i
may
--
mr.
milton
handler
i
believe
it's
what
i've
told
justice
fortas
it's
a
--
mr.
milton
handler
principal?
mr.
milton
handler
i
don't
know
what
would
be
the
principal
item.
it's
a
variety
as
to
help
--
mr.
milton
handler
to
the
non
--
mr.
milton
handler
to
that
by
this,
that
is
correct.
they
do
everything
on
the
nonsponsored,
they
do
for
the
sponsored
to
help
the
dealer
be
a
good
merchant.
mr.
milton
handler
well,
because
we
are
training
the
dealer
to
handle
tba
and
they're
paying
us
for
the
recommendation.
mr.
milton
handler
and
the
services
that
we're
rendering.
mr.
milton
handler
well,
--
mr.
milton
handler
what's
that?
mr.
milton
handler
they
don't
get
--
they
don't
get
the
recommendation
for
nothing.
mr.
milton
handler
but
the
salesman
is
neutral
and
he
helps
the
dealer
in
the
purchase
of
any
kind
of
tba
that
he
may
desire
and
this
record
establishes
the
total
freedom
of
choice
of
the
dealer.
now,
could
i
take
a
few
minutes
to
review
this
testimony
of
the
competing
suppliers
and
this
is
also
cited
--
these
directed
references
cited
in
the
government's
brief.
the
salesman
for
a
wholesaler
testified
that
he
was
unable
to
sell
none
sponsored
tires
to
a
particular
texaco
station
and
that
the
gist
of
the
conversation
was
that
he
wouldn't
dare
to
buy
or
display
such
tires.
the
dealer
himself
was
called
to
the
stand
and
gave
the
light
of
these
testimonies
stating
that
he
knew
that
he
was
free
to
buy
nonsponsored
tba
that
most
of
the
tba
that
he
buys
is
in
fact
nonsponsored.
he
went
on
to
testify
that
he
sort
out
the
very
wholesaler
in
question
to
deal
with
them
and
that
he
has
continued
to
purchase
nonsponsored
tba
from
there.
the
government
also
in
its
brief
refers
to
the
testimony
of
a
wholesaler
who
reported
that
he
lost
a
particular
texaco
dealer
as
a
customer
and
that
the
dealer
told
him
he
was
going
to
have
to
handle
goodrich
products.
this
ignores
the
reason
for
the
ship
which
occurred
incidentally
some
14
years
that
the
texaco
sales-commission
plan
went
into
effect.
the
reason
as
the
wholesaler
admitted
on
cross-examination
was
that
the
dealer's
brother
had
just
become
a
goodrich
distributor
at
a
location
one
and
a
half
blocks
from
the
dealer
station.
in
short,
this
texaco
dealer
bought
nonsponsored
tba
continuously
until
his
brother
went
into
business.
the
court
of
appeals
we
submit
had
the
right
on
the
universal
camera
to
take
the
record
as
a
whole
and
to
find
that
this
evidence
was
not
worthy
of
belief.
it
could've
relied
upon
the
fact
that
the
witnesses
who
are
representatives
of
one
small
battery
manufacturer
and
19
wholesalers
out
of
the
thousands
have
supplies
in
the
country.
and
chicago
alone
where
many
of
them
came
there
were
some
500
tba
distributors.
the
bulk
of
these
competing
suppliers
operated
the
competitive
disadvantage
wholly
unrelated
to
texaco
sales-commission
agreements.
several
conceded
that
they
were
unable
to
match
the
price
brand
or
credit
offered
by
competitors.
most
of
them
did
not
carry
a
full
line
of
tba
which
is
necessary
for
effective
competition.
even
so,
virtually
all
of
these
witnesses
had
texaco
dealers
among
their
customers
and
in
each
territory
to
which
their
testimony
related
there
was
overwhelming
proof
that
the
nonsponsored
products
handled
by
texaco
dealers
were
advertised
and
openly
displayed
at
their
stations.
in
this
context
of
open
display
and
advertising
of
nonsponsored
products
by
texaco
dealers
was
no
basis
for
any
dealer
feeling
constraint.
in
fact,
the
very
dealers
who
are
quoted
as
having
--
as
supplied
is
the
reason
from
not
buying
the
supplier's
products
that
they
might
be
penalize
by
texaco
all
handled
and
displayed
none
sponsored
tba.
mr.
milton
handler
i
missed
one
word
your
honor.
mr.
milton
handler
i
don't
know
what
“urged”
means,
it
recommended
and
i
might
say
that
--
mr.
milton
handler
i
don't
think
so
your
honor.
there
is
in
any
evidence
in
this
record
that
anybody
was
ever
cancelled
for
anything
that
remotely
suggest
--
mr.
milton
handler
why?
mr.
milton
handler
well,
we
know
your
honor
it
can't
cut
two
ways
because
we
know
that
the
preponderance
of
the
tba
handled
was
nonsponsored.
this
is
a
fact
in
the
record
that
cannot
be
denied.
mr.
milton
handler
i
don't
think
so.
this
--
you
would
then
say
that
an
employer
might
not
recommend
to
his
workers
that
they
remain
none
union
and
this
court
has
held
to
the
contrary
or
you
might
say
that
an
employer
who
has
dominant
economic
power
could
not
recommend
to
his
employees
that
they
patronize
an
employee's
owned
and
operated
store.
mr.
milton
handler
he
had
the
fact
that
dealers
who
are
in
very
short
supply
that
there's
vague
competition
for
good
dealers
and
that
there's
great
economic
lost
if
they
stationed
as
closed
down
because
you
can't
get
a
dealer
and
this
is
perennial
situation
in
this
industry
and
the
economic
lost
by
having
a
station
closed
is
much
greater
than
any
gain
that
you
can
get
out
of
these
commissions.
bear
in
mind
that
texaco,
as
this
record
indicates
for
selling
a
billion
and
a
half
dollars
of
petroleum
products.
this
is
where
it
was
--
this
was
its
business.
and
while
these
commissions
loomed
up
large
in
relation
to
the
magnitude
of
the
business
that
was
done
by
texaco,
this
was
a
rather
insignificant
part
of
its
business.
so,
that
there
was
tremendous
broadening
power
in
the
part
of
the
texaco
dealer
and
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
able
court
twice
reviewing
this
record
has
been
satisfied
that
this
record
establishes
that
there
was
no
veil
threat,
no
velvet
glove
but
that
the
texaco
dealer
was
free
and
he
did
exercise
his
own
choice
and
they
exercised
it
to
the
extent
of
the
preponderance
of
the
selection
that
he
made.
now,
--
mr.
milton
handler
under
universal
camera
it
was
set
aside
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
imposing
the
grant
of
certiorari.
we
argue
that
this
was
essentially
a
fact
case.
the
question
was
whether
court
of
appeals
was
right
or
whether
the
commission
was
right
and
we
didn't
think
that
your
honors
would
want
to
take
on
that
burden
but
this
--
the
court
of
appeals
twice
has
assessed
this
record
and
we
think
properly.
in
other
words,
we
believe
that
illegality
here
must
stand
from
a
requirement
that
the
dealer
handled
the
sponsored
tba.
this
requirement
may
be
inferred
from
the
surrounding
circumstances
that
need
not
be
expressed.
the
seventh
circuit
in
atlantic
found
such
a
requirement.
the
fifth
circuit
in
shell
found
such
a
requirement.
this
record
will
not
support
any
such
findings
--
mr.
milton
handler
the
commission
said
that
sales-commission
with
dominant
power
plus
recommendation
is
an
unfair
method
of
competition
and
we
say
that
--
mr.
milton
handler
that
is
correct.
mr.
milton
handler
we
construe
that
as
being
a
per
se
rule.
mr.
milton
handler
i'm
delighted
your
honors
asked
that
question.
i
think
i
was
one
of
the
earliest
commentators
to
criticize
of
the
majority
opinion
in
gratz
and
to
urge
that
the
minority
opinion
become
the
law
of
the
land.
the
minority
opinion
permits
the
flexibility
in
the
establishment
of
what
is
an
unfair
method
of
competition
but
the
arrangement
must
partake
of
something
which
is
restrictive
and
this
is
not
a
restrictive
arrangement.
because
the
finding
of
fact
which
has
not
been
subverted
is
that
the
dealer
is
not
restrained,
he's
free
to
do
anything
he
pleases.
mr.
milton
handler
i
think
the
legislative
history
of
the
statute
and
the
course
of
judicial
construction.
mr.
milton
handler
what's
that?
mr.
milton
handler
i
don't
believe
from
them
where
i
could,
i
can
pinpoint
the
exact
case
but
i
am
familiar
with
the
line
of
cases.
it's
never
been
suggested
that
the
commission
had
a
blank
check
and
that
it's
--
mr.
milton
handler
they
may
do
if
what
your
honor
so
hold.
in
other
words,
whatever
your
honors
say
is
unfair
methods
of
competition
represents
unfair
methods
of
competition
but
i
think
that
you
got
to
take
--
mr.
milton
handler
well,
i
think
--
mr.
milton
handler
your
honors
have
held
many
times
that
whatever
the
commission
holds
to
be
unlawful
is
in
tackle
to
great
weight
but
that
in
the
final
analysis
what
is
unfair
competition
is
a
matter
of
law
and
your
honors
have
the
final
word.
in
other
words,
i
don't
that
your
scope
of
review
is
that
if
they
found
that
it's
an
unfair
method
of
competition
that's
the
end
of
the
--
mr.
milton
handler
i'm
sorry.
mr.
milton
handler
no,
no,
it's
a
question
of
law
as
to
what
is
an
unfair
method
of
competition
and
i
think
that
as
justice
cardozo
pointed
out
and
already
a
case
that
if
you
simply
gave
a
blank
check
is
to
what
maybe
held
to
be
unfair
without
any
standards
that
this
would
be
--
mr.
milton
handler
oh!
no.
what
is
an
unfair
method
of
competition
is
illegal
question.
universal
camera
has
to
do
with
the
finding
as
to
whether
or
not
there
was
any
foreclosure
at
the
third
level
that's
where
universal
camera
comes
in.
mr.
milton
handler
if
the
foreclosure
is
not
necessary,
then
you
have
a
question
of
law
and
that
was
why
i
amended
justice
fortas'
statement
whether
power
plus
recommendation
is
violative
of
the
federal
trade
commission
act
absent
anticompetitive
effect
and
absent
foreclosure.
mr.
milton
handler
now,
if
i
may
conclude
our
proposition
with
respect
to
one
of
the
points
that
was
made
by
my
good
friend
and
also
made
by
the
commission
that
having
one
company
free
of
restraint
and
having
two
other
companies
under
the
order
of
the
commission
is
discriminatory.
we
don't
think
so
at
all
when
two
companies
has
misbehave
and
they
violated
the
law
and
defer
has
not
violated
the
law,
we
think
that
the
shoes
on
the
other
foot
that
it
would
be
unfair
to
make
the
one
who
hasn't
violated
the
law
subject
put
run
but
not
violating
the
law
subject
to
restrain.
and
the
commission
itself
didn't
think
it
was
anything
unfair
in
the
first
ground.
they
didn't
hold
against
us,
they
sent
it
back
for
evidence
which
was
never
forthcoming.
now,
finally,
my
good
friend
says
that
it
wouldn't
deal
with
the
potentials
that
this
may
germinate
into
a
full
blown
restraint.
well,
that
assumes
that
there
was
anything
restrictive
about
this
but
if
you
stop
with
the
federal
on
the
fact
which
is
admitted
here
that
that
there
was
total
freedom
of
choice
in
the
part
of
the
dealer.
we
say
there
was
no
restraint
and
after
all
a
practice
that's
been
the
fact
since
1920
--
1940
rather
that
30
years
has
had
ample
time
to
germinate.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
hold
that
coercion
is
necessary.
it
was
a
two-legged
holding.
they
held
that
if
there
was
a
misuse
of
the
economic
power
apart
from
coercion
that
the
law
could
be
violated
but
they
found
no
such
misuse.
thank
you
very
much
your
honor.
mr.
milton
handler
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
--
mr.
milton
handler
please
the
court.
when
the
1965
following
the
court's
decision
in
atlantic,
your
honors
remanded
this
case
to
the
commission
for
reconsideration
in
the
light
of
the
principles
laid
down
in
atlantic,
it
was
perfectly
plain
that
as
it
is
now
that
texaco
was
a
large
company
engaged
in
the
sale
of
petroleum
products
to
its
dealers
that
goodrich
is
a
large
tire
company
and
the
business
of
selling
tba
items
that
texaco's
leases
and
sales
agreements
with
its
dealers
are
of
short
duration
and
that
texaco's
dealers
purchase
substantial
quantities
of
the
sponsored
goodrich
tba.
if
it
had
been
your
honors'
intention
therefore
in
atlantic
to
hold
that
the
sales-commission
agreement
and
these
circumstances
as
per
se
unlawful.
there
would
have
been
no
point
in
remanding
our
case
for
application
of
atlantic
to
the
facts
of
record
here.
all
that
was
needed
--
mr.
milton
handler
that
may
be
your
honor,
but
the
order
of
the
courts
says,
remand
for
application
of
the
principles
of
atlantic.
and
if
there
was
per
se
illegality
although
it
was
necessary
to
--
was
to
enter
a
final
order
of
reinstating
the
commission's
order.
we
do
not
read
atlantic
as
adopting
a
rule
of
per
se
illegality.
this
was
not
the
ground
upon
which
my
good
friend
and
former
student
mr.
friedman
argued
atlantic.
mr.
milton
handler
i
think
it
took
extremely
well,
your
honor.
he's
one
of
the
most
distinguished
graduates
of
our
school.
on
oral
argument,
he
emphatically
declared
and
i
quote
“the
government
does
not
suggest
that
there
may
not
be
commission
sales
agreements
which
would
satisfy
section
5.”
he
squarely
recognized
and
again
i
quote,
“that
there
may
very
well
be
situations
where
eliminating
some
of
the
things
they
namely,
atlantic
and
goodyear
did
in
this
case
would
not
have
the
same
adverse
effect
on
the
competition
as
the
plan,
the
commission
condemn.”
he
repeatedly
in
response
to
the
questions
from
the
court
disclaimed
a
per
se
theory
of
the
legality.
and
no
claim
of
per
se
unlawfulness
was
made
in
the
government's
brief
in
atlantic.
more
importantly,
mr.
justice
clark's
opinion
does
not
hold
that
the
mere
existence
of
superior
economic
power
in
the
oil
company
be
with
its
dealers
results
in
illegality.
the
opinion
makes
clear
that
the
gravamen
of
the
violation
consist
of
the
misused
of
that
power
with
concomitant
anticompetitive
results.
in
a
nutshell,
the
commission's
order
in
atlantic
was
upheld
because
the
oil
company,
and
i'm
quoting
now
from
mr.
justice
clark,
“marshaled
its
full
economic
power
in
a
continuing
campaign
to
force
its
dealers
and
wholesalers
to
buy
goodyear
products.”
and
that
rational
was
precisely
the
one
that
the
government
advanced
in
its
brief
to
this
court
and
again,
i
quote,
“in
some,
atlantic
marshaled
the
full
measure
of
its
economic
power
over
its
dealers
to
carryout
a
pressure
campaign
designed
to
get
them
to
handle
goodyear
and
firestone
products
and
because
of
the
extent
of
that
power,
the
campaign
was
highly
successful.”
mr.
milton
handler
what's
that
--
mr.
milton
handler
i'm
going
to
go
into
that
your
honor.
i'd
wanted
to
clear
the
way
that
your
honors
did
not
hold
it
sales-commission
was
per
se
unlawful.
therefore,
its
validity
depends
upon
the
facts
and
i
want
to
go
into
the
facts
to
show
that
the
facts
here
do
not
want
the
application
of
atlantic
because
the
facts
are
totally
different.
mr.
milton
handler
well,
your
honors
say
--
the
--
mr.
milton
handler
what
was
that?
your
honors
remanded
the
case
for
the
application
of
atlantic
to
the
facts
of
this
case.
that's
what
your
mandate
said
and
mr.
friedman
has
acknowledged
in
response
to
a
question
that
atlantic
does
not
control
and
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
atlantic
was
not
controlling
because
the
facts
were
different
and
that's
why
it's
one
of
the
reasons
why
it
set
aside
the
order
of
the
commission.
now,
why
is
this
case
your
honors
different
from
the
other
two?
this
case
is
different
because
texaco
unlike
atlantic
and
shell
did
not
wilt
its
economic
power
to
interfere
with
the
freedom
of
choice
of
its
dealers.
twice
has
the
court
of
appeals
so
found
after
careful
review
of
this
bulky
sixth
volume
record
applying
the
same
principles
as
those
established
in
atlantic
and
enforced
in
shell
by
the
fifth
circuit.
the
court
below
found
that
the
texaco
dealers
were
entirely
free
to
handle
the
tba
of
their
own
choice
without
any
interference
whatsoever
on
the
part
of
texaco.
it
found
that
it
is
been
texaco's
policy
to
respect
the
independence
of
its
dealers
and
that
its
practices
have
matched
that
policy.
this
was
the
testimony
of
literality
scores
of
witnesses.
many
call
to
the
stand
by
the
commission
itself.
it's
our
submission
your
honors
that
a
plan
which
leaves
dealers
entirely
free
to
accept
or
to
reject
sponsored
products
cannot
produce
any
anticompetitive
effect
and
unless
the
court
adopts
a
doctrine
of
per
se
illegality
cannot
be
found
to
be
unlawful
and
that
was
why
i
started
my
argument
by
trying
to
point
out
that
the
court
had
not
in
the
prior
case
to
reach
any
conclusions
as
to
per
se
illegality.
mr.
milton
handler
i'm
delighted
to
answer
that
your
honor.
the
commission
asked
texaco
to
compile
certain
information
which
it
did.
the
commission
offered
this
evidence
itself.
this
evidence
showed
that
less
than
one-third
of
texaco
dealers
handled
any
of
the
sponsored
tires
and
only
about
one-fifth
handled
the
sponsored
batteries.
this
means
that
80%
of
the
batteries
that
they
handled
were
nonsponsored
and
about
70%
of
the
tires
were
nonsponsored
and
they
handled
a
great
variety
of
other
products.
this
record
as
we
pleat
with
the
advertisements
of
250
different
tba
items
which
the
texaco
dealers
handled
and
advertised.
now,
the
curious
thing
that
we
find
about
the
government's
argument
here
is
that
it
neither
contends
for
a
rule
of
per
se
illegality
nor
does
it
make
a
frontal
attack
on
the
findings
of
the
court
of
appeals
upholding
the
freedom
of
texaco
dealers
to
handle
tba
of
their
own
choice.
instead,
in
its
brief,
the
solicitor
general
appears
to
be
propounding
a
brand
new
theory
of
liability.
i
might
say
this
case
has
been
before
this
court
twice,
before
the
court
of
appeals
twice,
before
the
commission
three
times
and
each
time
that
i've
appeared,
i've
been
confronted
with
a
new
theory
of
the
legality.
before
i
address
myself
to
the
new
theory,
i'd
like
to
with
your
honors
permission
underscore
what
is
not
involved
in
this
case
as
mr.
friedman
pointed
out,
we're
not
confronted
here
with
coercion
that's
out
of
the
case
nor
does
the
case
involved
any
claim
of
a
tie-in.
that
argument
was
made
before
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
first
ground
and
it
was
rejected
because
it's
unsupported
by
the
facts
and
it
has
never
been
devoured.
mr.
milton
handler
i'm
sorry
i
don't
hear
you
mr.
justice.
mr.
milton
handler
well,
i'll
accept
that
your
honor
for
purposes
of
the
argument.
the
coercion
order,
the
two
provisions
of
the
coercion
order
have
been
stricken
and
the
government
has
agreed
to
have
them
stricken
and
i
will
point
out
that
there
is
no
nothing
that
resembles
any
kind
of
coercion
whether
it
would
overt
or
implied
or
covered.
there's
just
nothing
in
this
record
that
will
support
any
such
conclusion.
mr.
milton
handler
no,
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
texaco
had
dominant
power.
we
disagree
but
that
issue
is
not
before
that
court.
mr.
milton
handler
what
was
that?
mr.
milton
handler
we
think
that
dominant
power
means
the
power
to
force
people
to
do
something
against
their
will.
mr.
milton
handler
that
is
correct
and
this
record
establishes
the
correctness
of
that
conclusion.
mr.
milton
handler
that
is
correct.
mr.
milton
handler
that
is
correct.
the
nature
of
this
agreement
--
mr.
milton
handler
that
is
correct.
we
say
power
--
mr.
milton
handler
that's
our
submission
your
honor
that
power
plus
salesmanship
does
not
add
up
to
illegality.
mr.
milton
handler
i
would
deny
that
we
have
any
kind
of
a
touch.
i
deny
empathically
and
i
don't
think
this
record
will
establish
that
we
have
any
touch.
and
i
will
now
explain
why.
i
was
trying
to
put
aside
the
things
that
are
not
involved
in
the
case.
there's
no
claim
here
that
we
agreed
with
goodrich
that
we've
require
our
dealers
to
handle
their
products.
finally,
there's
no
longer
of
any
claim
here
that
texaco
in
fact
required
its
dealers
to
handle
the
sponsored
tba.
that
was
the
basis
upon
which
all
of
the
prior
decisions
rest
the
requirement.
indeed,
in
this
petition
for
certiorari,
the
government
said
that
the
court
of
appeals
conclusion
that
the
texaco
dealers
were
free
to
charge
nonsponsored
--
to
choose
nonsponsored
tba
is
irrelevant.
our
submission
is
that
that
fact
the
dealer
freedom
of
choice
is
not
only
irrelevant,
it
is
decisive.
mr.
milton
handler
your
honor,
i
will
answer
that
specific
incident
and
then
i'm
going
to
review
other
incidents
in
this
record
which
led
the
court
of
appeals
to
say
that
this
finding
of
the
commission
with
respect
to
the
supplier
testimony
was
not
supported
by
the
retroact.
in
the
case
of
mr.
--
mr.
milton
handler
what's
that?
mr.
milton
handler
yes,
i'm
going
to
answer
that.
mr.
milton
handler
mr.
tidwell
as
my
good
friend
points
out
had
the
conversation
with
the
dealer,
with
the
salesmen
which
he
asked
for
the
salesmen
advice.
now,
the
record
shows
that
tidwell
continued
to
sell
these
nonsponsored
tires
as
well
as
nonsponsored
batteries.
and
he
told
the
examiner
that
he
was
handling
firestone
because
he
preferred
to
handle
firestone.
so
we
had
dangling
in
the
air
a
conversation
which
apparently
has
no
effect
because
he
continues
to
handle
the
other
products
just
after
the
conversation
exactly
as
he
did
before.
now,
what
is
left
to
this
case?
the
government
in
its
brief
says
that
even
if
the
dealers
were
not
constrained
they
felt
that
they
were
constrained.
this,
i
think
your
honor
is
the
velvet
glove.
the
argument
is
made
that
the
texaco
dealer
though
not
in
fact
required
to
buy
a
sponsored
product.
nevertheless,
does
not
exercise
the
freedom
that
is
his
of
selecting
tba
brands
solely
on
the
basis
of
the
comparative
merits
of
the
competing
products.
the
suggestion
is
that
the
dealer
may
be
concerned
albeit
erroneously
that
texaco
would
disapprove
of
his
purchase
of
nonsponsored
tba
so
that
in
the
absence
of
strong
countervailing,
the
fact
is
the
dealer
is
most
likely
to
acquiesce
in
texaco's
recommendation
to
purchase
the
sponsored
products.
now,
i
believe
we
have
the
right
to
ask
where
in
this
record
is
the
proof
that
the
texaco
dealers
do
not
purchase
tba
on
the
basis
of
irrelative
merits
of
the
particular
brand.
where
is
the
proof
that
there
must
be
strong
countervailing
factors
before
texaco
dealers
provide
nonsponsored
products?
where
is
the
proof
that
texaco
dealers
fail
constrain
to
acquiesce
in
texaco's
recommendations?
i
should've
thought,
your
honors,
that
since
the
government's
argument
depends
on
psychoanalyzing
a
body
of
dealers,
it
would've
favored
us
with
some
words
from
the
patients
themselves.
but
the
most
amazing
part
of
this
new
theory
is
that
it
is
evoked
in
the
case
where
the
government
failed
to
call
a
single
texaco
dealer
and
texaco
has
38,000
of
them
to
testify
as
a
witness
not
one.
now,
why
should
the
government
on
appeal
after
13
years
of
litigation
now
speculate
or
make
assumptions
concerning
the
attitude
or
feelings
of
the
dealers.
the
dealers
were
at
all
times
available
as
witnesses,
they
could've
testified
as
to
what
animated
their
tba
purchases.
texaco
in
fact
produced
many
of
these,
such
witnesses
as
part
of
its
defense
case.
and
they
made
it
perfectly
plain.
some
54
of
them
but
they
were
not
pressured
and
to
anything
by
texaco
and
that
they
felt
no
constrain.
the
government
on
the
other
hand
avoided
dealer
witnesses
like
to
play.
and
we
don't
have
to
look
too
hard
for
the
reason.
i
refer
your
honors
to
volume
5
of
the
appendix
and
you
will
see
there
a
form
letter
which
counsel
to
the
commission
sent
to
texaco
dealers.
the
first
paragraph
of
which
reads,
complaints
including
one
on
the
above
entitled
matter
currently
pending
before
the
commission
are
intended
to
determine
whether
operators
of
major
oil
company
petroleum
outlets
are
independent
businessmen
with
complete
freedom
of
choice
as
to
the
products
which
they
stopped
for
resale
or
are
obliged
to
handle
products
chosen
for
them
by
the
respective
oil
companies.
and
then
in
connection
with
this
issue,
the
questionnaire
seeks
information
as
to
whether
tba
has
handled
and
what
is
the
principle
line
that
is
handled
when
they
took
on
the
line
and
similar
matters.
in
short,
in
this
questionnaire,
the
government
--
the
commission
correctly
stated
the
issue
which
was
the
issue
which
was
tried
whether
the
dealers
have
freedom
of
choice
or
whether
they
were
obliged
to
buy
the
sponsored
products.
now,
after
getting
the
facts,
elicited
by
this
question
there
what
the
commission
do.
they
decided
not
to
call
any
texaco
dealers
as
witnesses.
the
plain
implication
is
that
the
responses
to
the
question
there
did
not
support
the
charges
against
respondents.
indeed,
the
one
response
which
texaco
was
able
to
obtain
and
which
is
set
out
as
jax
428
of
the
record
at
last
page
very
clearly
why
the
dealers
were
not
put
on
the
stand
because
the
witness
indicated
that
he
was
totally
free.
now,
having
in
its
possession
facts
which
negates
its
theory
and
supported
the
defense,
the
commission
not
only
did
not
introduce
these
facts,
it
suppressed
them.
it
refused
even
to
disclose
to
texaco
the
names
of
the
persons
that
had
interviewed.
now,
after
withholding
evidence
that
the
texaco
dealers
do
not
feel
constrain
to
buy
the
sponsored
tba
i
submit
that
the
government
is
highly
in
the
position
to
ask
this
court
now
to
make
the
assumptions
upon
which
its
present
argument
rest.
now,
mr.
justice
douglas
in
brady
against
maryland
quotes
from
former
solicitor
general
sobeloff,
an
addressed
that
he
made
and
which
he
said,
“my
client's
chief
business
is
not
to
achieve
victory
but
to
establish
justice.”
and
i
must
regretfully
state
to
this
court
the
model
of
the
commission
is
precisely
the
reversed
as
this
sorted
and
supported
record
demonstrates
and
has
--
as
does
the
history
of
this
litigation.
now,
certainly
the
hearsay
testimony
of
a
few
wholesalers
does
not
remedy
the
deficiency
of
the
government's
case.
these
wholesalers
testified
they
were
told
by
some
particular
texaco
dealer
who
decline
to
buy
nonsponsored
tba
from
them
but
he
couldn't
do
so
because
texaco
might
disapprove.
quite
apart
from
the
inherently
unreliable
nature
of
this
hearsay,
the
wholesalers
themselves
on
this
record
acknowledged
their
potential
customers
may
convene
excuses
for
not
buying.
the
testimony
was
overwhelmingly
rebutted
as
the
court
below
found
but
the
record
as
a
whole.
let
me
give
you
---
mr.
milton
handler
the
contract
is
very
brief.
the
record
establishes
that
it
cost
texaco
70%
of
the
commissions
that
it
receives.
it
has
38,000
dealers.
it's
acting
as
a
sales
representative.
goodrich
does
not
have
enough
salesmen
to
visit
all
of
38,000
accounts.
the
dealers
are
versed
in
the
art
of
pumping
gasoline
out
of
the
pumps.
tba
is
a
difficult
technical
business,
they
have
to
be
trained.
inventory
control
was
very
difficult,
there
are
all
kinds
of
sizes,
all
kinds
of
products.
they
have
to
be
trained
on
installation.
texaco
had
to
build
facilities
to
store
the
tba.
texaco
permits
its
credit
cards
to
be
used
guarantying
payment
and
the
dealer
is
not
charge
for
any
of
these
services.
texaco
was
performing
the
service
as
a
sales
representative
in
exchange
for
receiving
commissions.
mr.
milton
handler
they
engaged
in
salesmanship
and
promotion
of
these
products.
mr.
milton
handler
there
may
be
an
ambiguity
when
your
honors
speaks
of
selling,
they're
not
selling
in
a
normal
sense
of
taking
the
line
and
try
to
get
the
dealer.
they
--
the
selling
is
done
by
goodrich
but
they
will
instruct
the
dealer
on
how
to
merchandise
his
product
and
there's
no
doubt
about
it
that
they
recommend
that
the
dealer
handle
the
sponsored
lines
if
he
wants
to.
mr.
milton
handler
it's
available
if
any
kind
of
tba.
mr.
milton
handler
the
dealers
have
signs
of
all
kinds
and
they
have
signs
of
tba
--
they
have
the
signs
of
firestone
and
goodrich.
mr.
milton
handler
no,
that's
done
by
goodrich
or
firestone
itself.
mr.
milton
handler
that's
correct.
mr.
milton
handler
that's
correct.
mr.
milton
handler
with
one
amendment,
you
first
stated
the
jugular
issue
your
honor.
you
got
to
add
without
any
proof
of
any
anticompetitive
effects
such
as
were
found
in
atlantic
and
in
shell.
bear
in
mind
that
these
three
cases
were
decided
by
the
commission
at
the
same
time
on
the
same
day.
it's
not
only
the
court
of
appeals
which
is
twice
found
that
this
record
would
not
support
an
order.
the
first
commission
simultaneously
with
the
issuance
of
orders
against
atlantic
and
shell
held
that
this
record
was
not
sufficient
to
warrant
an
order
against
texaco
and
remanded
the
case
to
the
hearing
examiner
to
go
into
the
question
of
anticompetitive
effect
a
vital
factor
--
a
critical
factor
which
was
lacking.
and
the
--
there
was
a
sham
remand
we
tried
to
enjoin
in
the
courts
because
the
very
anticompetitive
effects
which
the
commission
found
lacking
we're
allege
in
the
complaint.
so
that
the
counsel
for
the
complainant
for
the
commission
had
had
ample
opportunity
after
several
years
of
investigation,
and
several
years
of
trial
to
prove
these
facts
behind
them.
we
said,
he
didn't
have
them
and
we
couldn't
prove
them.
we
wanted
the
court
to
enjoin
the
hearing.
the
commission
of
representative
solemnly
told
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
that
it
had
new
evidence.
we
came
back
for
a
hearing,
they
offered
nothing.
what
they
did
was
violative
of
the
law
of
evidence.
they
took
judicial
notice
the
facts
were
in
the
other
records.
the
commission
then
said,
this
was
improper
and
it
has
excluded
all
of
the
remand
evidence
as
improper
so
that
the
record
today
as
just
as
deficient
now
as
it
was
the
first
time
it
came
before
the
commission.
now,
our
submission
justice
fortas
is
that
assuming
we're
a
large
company,
assuming
though
anticompetitive
effects,
assuming
that
all
that
you
have
is
that
a
large
amount
of
tba
sponsored
as
so
and
assuming
that
we
got
a
commission
70%
--
which
adds
up
to
a
lot
of
money
where
a
big
company
70%
of
which
represented
our
cost
we
say
that
this
is
not
a
violation
of
the
federal
trade
commission
case.
that's
our
case
in
a
nutshell.
now
if
i
may
--
mr.
milton
handler
i
believe
it's
what
i've
told
justice
fortas
it's
a
--
mr.
milton
handler
principal?
mr.
milton
handler
i
don't
know
what
would
be
the
principal
item.
it's
a
variety
as
to
help
--
mr.
milton
handler
to
the
non
--
mr.
milton
handler
to
that
by
this,
that
is
correct.
they
do
everything
on
the
nonsponsored,
they
do
for
the
sponsored
to
help
the
dealer
be
a
good
merchant.
mr.
milton
handler
well,
because
we
are
training
the
dealer
to
handle
tba
and
they're
paying
us
for
the
recommendation.
mr.
milton
handler
and
the
services
that
we're
rendering.
mr.
milton
handler
well,
--
mr.
milton
handler
what's
that?
mr.
milton
handler
they
don't
get
--
they
don't
get
the
recommendation
for
nothing.
mr.
milton
handler
but
the
salesman
is
neutral
and
he
helps
the
dealer
in
the
purchase
of
any
kind
of
tba
that
he
may
desire
and
this
record
establishes
the
total
freedom
of
choice
of
the
dealer.
now,
could
i
take
a
few
minutes
to
review
this
testimony
of
the
competing
suppliers
and
this
is
also
cited
--
these
directed
references
cited
in
the
government's
brief.
the
salesman
for
a
wholesaler
testified
that
he
was
unable
to
sell
none
sponsored
tires
to
a
particular
texaco
station
and
that
the
gist
of
the
conversation
was
that
he
wouldn't
dare
to
buy
or
display
such
tires.
the
dealer
himself
was
called
to
the
stand
and
gave
the
light
of
these
testimonies
stating
that
he
knew
that
he
was
free
to
buy
nonsponsored
tba
that
most
of
the
tba
that
he
buys
is
in
fact
nonsponsored.
he
went
on
to
testify
that
he
sort
out
the
very
wholesaler
in
question
to
deal
with
them
and
that
he
has
continued
to
purchase
nonsponsored
tba
from
there.
the
government
also
in
its
brief
refers
to
the
testimony
of
a
wholesaler
who
reported
that
he
lost
a
particular
texaco
dealer
as
a
customer
and
that
the
dealer
told
him
he
was
going
to
have
to
handle
goodrich
products.
this
ignores
the
reason
for
the
ship
which
occurred
incidentally
some
14
years
that
the
texaco
sales-commission
plan
went
into
effect.
the
reason
as
the
wholesaler
admitted
on
cross-examination
was
that
the
dealer's
brother
had
just
become
a
goodrich
distributor
at
a
location
one
and
a
half
blocks
from
the
dealer
station.
in
short,
this
texaco
dealer
bought
nonsponsored
tba
continuously
until
his
brother
went
into
business.
the
court
of
appeals
we
submit
had
the
right
on
the
universal
camera
to
take
the
record
as
a
whole
and
to
find
that
this
evidence
was
not
worthy
of
belief.
it
could've
relied
upon
the
fact
that
the
witnesses
who
are
representatives
of
one
small
battery
manufacturer
and
19
wholesalers
out
of
the
thousands
have
supplies
in
the
country.
and
chicago
alone
where
many
of
them
came
there
were
some
500
tba
distributors.
the
bulk
of
these
competing
suppliers
operated
the
competitive
disadvantage
wholly
unrelated
to
texaco
sales-commission
agreements.
several
conceded
that
they
were
unable
to
match
the
price
brand
or
credit
offered
by
competitors.
most
of
them
did
not
carry
a
full
line
of
tba
which
is
necessary
for
effective
competition.
even
so,
virtually
all
of
these
witnesses
had
texaco
dealers
among
their
customers
and
in
each
territory
to
which
their
testimony
related
there
was
overwhelming
proof
that
the
nonsponsored
products
handled
by
texaco
dealers
were
advertised
and
openly
displayed
at
their
stations.
in
this
context
of
open
display
and
advertising
of
nonsponsored
products
by
texaco
dealers
was
no
basis
for
any
dealer
feeling
constraint.
in
fact,
the
very
dealers
who
are
quoted
as
having
--
as
supplied
is
the
reason
from
not
buying
the
supplier's
products
that
they
might
be
penalize
by
texaco
all
handled
and
displayed
none
sponsored
tba.
mr.
milton
handler
i
missed
one
word
your
honor.
mr.
milton
handler
i
don't
know
what
“urged”
means,
it
recommended
and
i
might
say
that
--
mr.
milton
handler
i
don't
think
so
your
honor.
there
is
in
any
evidence
in
this
record
that
anybody
was
ever
cancelled
for
anything
that
remotely
suggest
--
mr.
milton
handler
why?
mr.
milton
handler
well,
we
know
your
honor
it
can't
cut
two
ways
because
we
know
that
the
preponderance
of
the
tba
handled
was
nonsponsored.
this
is
a
fact
in
the
record
that
cannot
be
denied.
mr.
milton
handler
i
don't
think
so.
this
--
you
would
then
say
that
an
employer
might
not
recommend
to
his
workers
that
they
remain
none
union
and
this
court
has
held
to
the
contrary
or
you
might
say
that
an
employer
who
has
dominant
economic
power
could
not
recommend
to
his
employees
that
they
patronize
an
employee's
owned
and
operated
store.
mr.
milton
handler
he
had
the
fact
that
dealers
who
are
in
very
short
supply
that
there's
vague
competition
for
good
dealers
and
that
there's
great
economic
lost
if
they
stationed
as
closed
down
because
you
can't
get
a
dealer
and
this
is
perennial
situation
in
this
industry
and
the
economic
lost
by
having
a
station
closed
is
much
greater
than
any
gain
that
you
can
get
out
of
these
commissions.
bear
in
mind
that
texaco,
as
this
record
indicates
for
selling
a
billion
and
a
half
dollars
of
petroleum
products.
this
is
where
it
was
--
this
was
its
business.
and
while
these
commissions
loomed
up
large
in
relation
to
the
magnitude
of
the
business
that
was
done
by
texaco,
this
was
a
rather
insignificant
part
of
its
business.
so,
that
there
was
tremendous
broadening
power
in
the
part
of
the
texaco
dealer
and
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
able
court
twice
reviewing
this
record
has
been
satisfied
that
this
record
establishes
that
there
was
no
veil
threat,
no
velvet
glove
but
that
the
texaco
dealer
was
free
and
he
did
exercise
his
own
choice
and
they
exercised
it
to
the
extent
of
the
preponderance
of
the
selection
that
he
made.
now,
--
mr.
milton
handler
under
universal
camera
it
was
set
aside
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
imposing
the
grant
of
certiorari.
we
argue
that
this
was
essentially
a
fact
case.
the
question
was
whether
court
of
appeals
was
right
or
whether
the
commission
was
right
and
we
didn't
think
that
your
honors
would
want
to
take
on
that
burden
but
this
--
the
court
of
appeals
twice
has
assessed
this
record
and
we
think
properly.
in
other
words,
we
believe
that
illegality
here
must
stand
from
a
requirement
that
the
dealer
handled
the
sponsored
tba.
this
requirement
may
be
inferred
from
the
surrounding
circumstances
that
need
not
be
expressed.
the
seventh
circuit
in
atlantic
found
such
a
requirement.
the
fifth
circuit
in
shell
found
such
a
requirement.
this
record
will
not
support
any
such
findings
--
mr.
milton
handler
the
commission
said
that
sales-commission
with
dominant
power
plus
recommendation
is
an
unfair
method
of
competition
and
we
say
that
--
mr.
milton
handler
that
is
correct.
mr.
milton
handler
we
construe
that
as
being
a
per
se
rule.
mr.
milton
handler
i'm
delighted
your
honors
asked
that
question.
i
think
i
was
one
of
the
earliest
commentators
to
criticize
of
the
majority
opinion
in
gratz
and
to
urge
that
the
minority
opinion
become
the
law
of
the
land.
the
minority
opinion
permits
the
flexibility
in
the
establishment
of
what
is
an
unfair
method
of
competition
but
the
arrangement
must
partake
of
something
which
is
restrictive
and
this
is
not
a
restrictive
arrangement.
because
the
finding
of
fact
which
has
not
been
subverted
is
that
the
dealer
is
not
restrained,
he's
free
to
do
anything
he
pleases.
mr.
milton
handler
i
think
the
legislative
history
of
the
statute
and
the
course
of
judicial
construction.
mr.
milton
handler
what's
that?
mr.
milton
handler
i
don't
believe
from
them
where
i
could,
i
can
pinpoint
the
exact
case
but
i
am
familiar
with
the
line
of
cases.
it's
never
been
suggested
that
the
commission
had
a
blank
check
and
that
it's
--
mr.
milton
handler
they
may
do
if
what
your
honor
so
hold.
in
other
words,
whatever
your
honors
say
is
unfair
methods
of
competition
represents
unfair
methods
of
competition
but
i
think
that
you
got
to
take
--
mr.
milton
handler
well,
i
think
--
mr.
milton
handler
your
honors
have
held
many
times
that
whatever
the
commission
holds
to
be
unlawful
is
in
tackle
to
great
weight
but
that
in
the
final
analysis
what
is
unfair
competition
is
a
matter
of
law
and
your
honors
have
the
final
word.
in
other
words,
i
don't
that
your
scope
of
review
is
that
if
they
found
that
it's
an
unfair
method
of
competition
that's
the
end
of
the
--
mr.
milton
handler
i'm
sorry.
mr.
milton
handler
no,
no,
it's
a
question
of
law
as
to
what
is
an
unfair
method
of
competition
and
i
think
that
as
justice
cardozo
pointed
out
and
already
a
case
that
if
you
simply
gave
a
blank
check
is
to
what
maybe
held
to
be
unfair
without
any
standards
that
this
would
be
--
mr.
milton
handler
oh!
no.
what
is
an
unfair
method
of
competition
is
illegal
question.
universal
camera
has
to
do
with
the
finding
as
to
whether
or
not
there
was
any
foreclosure
at
the
third
level
that's
where
universal
camera
comes
in.
mr.
milton
handler
if
the
foreclosure
is
not
necessary,
then
you
have
a
question
of
law
and
that
was
why
i
amended
justice
fortas'
statement
whether
power
plus
recommendation
is
violative
of
the
federal
trade
commission
act
absent
anticompetitive
effect
and
absent
foreclosure.
mr.
milton
handler
now,
if
i
may
conclude
our
proposition
with
respect
to
one
of
the
points
that
was
made
by
my
good
friend
and
also
made
by
the
commission
that
having
one
company
free
of
restraint
and
having
two
other
companies
under
the
order
of
the
commission
is
discriminatory.
we
don't
think
so
at
all
when
two
companies
has
misbehave
and
they
violated
the
law
and
defer
has
not
violated
the
law,
we
think
that
the
shoes
on
the
other
foot
that
it
would
be
unfair
to
make
the
one
who
hasn't
violated
the
law
subject
put
run
but
not
violating
the
law
subject
to
restrain.
and
the
commission
itself
didn't
think
it
was
anything
unfair
in
the
first
ground.
they
didn't
hold
against
us,
they
sent
it
back
for
evidence
which
was
never
forthcoming.
now,
finally,
my
good
friend
says
that
it
wouldn't
deal
with
the
potentials
that
this
may
germinate
into
a
full
blown
restraint.
well,
that
assumes
that
there
was
anything
restrictive
about
this
but
if
you
stop
with
the
federal
on
the
fact
which
is
admitted
here
that
that
there
was
total
freedom
of
choice
in
the
part
of
the
dealer.
we
say
there
was
no
restraint
and
after
all
a
practice
that's
been
the
fact
since
1920
--
1940
rather
that
30
years
has
had
ample
time
to
germinate.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
hold
that
coercion
is
necessary.
it
was
a
two-legged
holding.
they
held
that
if
there
was
a
misuse
of
the
economic
power
apart
from
coercion
that
the
law
could
be
violated
but
they
found
no
such
misuse.
thank
you
very
much
your
honor.
