mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
in
this
case
which
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
is
whether
the
federal
trade
commission
correctly
held
that
a
sales-commission
plan
by
which
the
respondent,
texaco
distributed,
promoted
--
not
distributed,
i'm
sorry,
promoted
and
sponsored
the
sale
of
tires,
batteries
and
automotive
accessories
made
by
the
respondent,
goodrich
tire
and
rubber
company.
promoted
and
sponsored
the
sale
through
the
texaco
service
stations
in
return
for
a
commission
paid
to
texaco
by
goodrich
whether
the
commission
properly
held
that
this
constituted
an
unfair
method
of
competition
in
violation
section
5
of
the
trade
commission
act.
the
respondent
texaco
or
respondent
goodrich
also
had
a
similar
sales
commission
plan
with
the
firestone
rubber
and
tire
company
but
i
will
focus
primarily
in
this
case
on
their
relationships
with
goodrich.
this
case
is
one
of
three
companion
cases
that
the
commission
instituted
in
1956
challenging
the
sales-commission
method
of
distributing
tires,
batteries
and
automotive
accessories
which
are
commonly
referred
to
as
tba
in
the
industry.
and
each
of
these
cases
named
as
a
respondent
a
major
oil
company
and
a
major
tire
company.
in
each
case
after
protracted
proceedings,
the
trade
commission
held
that
the
sales-commission
plan
was
an
unfair
method
of
competition
and
entered
a
broad
cease
and
deceased
order
which
prohibited
each
of
these
companies
from
engaging
in
this
type
of
plan.
at
the
end
of
the
1964
term,
this
court
upheld
the
commission’s
order
directed
against
the
plan
involving
atlantic
refining
company
and
the
goodyear
tire
and
rubber
company.
subsequent
thereto,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
upheld
the
commission's
order
directed
against
the
plan
involving
the
shell
oil
company
and
firestone.
now,
while
those
two
cases
were
going
through
the
courts,
in
the
present
case,
the
texaco-goodrich
case,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
on
a
prior
appeal
set
aside
the
commission’s
order.
the
commission
filed
a
petition
for
certiorari
in
that
case
and
a
week
after
this
court
decided
the
atlantic
case
in
favor
of
the
commission
it
vacated
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
in
effect
remanded
the
case
to
the
commission
with
directions
to
reconsider
it
in
the
light
of
atlantic.
upon
such
reconsideration,
the
commission
issued
a
new
opinion
and
which
it
again
in
the
light
of
atlantic
concluded
that
this
sales-commission
system
was
an
unfair
method
of
competition
and
added
a
cease
and
deceased
order
the
same
as
the
order
that
had
been
upheld
by
this
court
in
atlantic.
once
again,
the
court
of
appeals
set
aside
the
commission’s
order
and
directed
the
commission
to
dismiss
the
complaint.
now,
the
economic
relationship
that
exists
between
the
respondent
texaco
and
its
retail
gasoline
service
station
dealers
is
basically
the
same
as
that
was
presented
to
this
court
in
the
atlantic
case.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
those
--
i'm
speaking
mr.
justice
of
just
the
economic
relationship
the
first
element,
the
power
relationship
between
the
company
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
and
the
dealers.
i
will
come
in
a
moment
and
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
explain
the
differences
in
the
way
in
which
the
power
was
exercised.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
texaco
is
one
of
the
largest
petroleum
dealers
in
the
country.
it
distributes
its
products
to
30,000
service
stations
many
more
than
involve
in
atlantic.
in
fact,
this
represents
about
one-sixth
of
all
the
service
stations
in
the
country.
these
service
stations
operate
on
two
bases
as
in
atlantic
about
40%
of
them
are
so-called
lessee
dealers
who
lease
their
station
from
atlantic,
the
remainder
are
so-called
contract
dealers
who
either
lease
their
station
from
a
third
person
or
in
fact
on
a
station.
the
way
in
which
the
stations
are
lease
here
is
the
same
as
basically
as
in
atlantic,
the
dealers
hold
the
stations
under
short-term
leases,
one-year
leases
which
permit
termination
by
either
side
upon
10
days
notice.
the
leases
have
similar
housekeeping
clauses
which
permit
immediate
cancellation
if
the
lessee
fails
to
comply
with
these
situations.
in
a
different
--
in
addition,
in
each
instance
of
course
the
dealer
is
completely
dependent
upon
texaco
for
its
supply
of
gasoline.
thereto,
they
have
a
yearly
contract
which
is
terminable
by
the
oil
company
on
30
days
notice.
the
sales
commission
plain
in
this
case
was
originally
entered
into
a
1940
and
it
was
renewed
in
1943.
and
under
the
plan,
goodrich
agrees
to
pay
texaco
a
10%
commission
on
all
goodrich
tba
that
is
sold
through
the
texaco
gasoline
stations
or
through
wholesale
outlets
and
this
payment
it
stated
in
the
sales
commission
agreement
is
in
consideration
of
the
aid
to
be
given
and
the
services
to
be
rendered
by
your
sales
organization
in
connection
with
promoting
the
sale
of
goodrich
products.
and
as
i've
indicated
to
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
will
shortly
come
to
what
they
did
in
carrying
out
this
obligation
to
promote
the
sale
of
products.
now,
during
the
five
year
period
for
which
date
is
in
the
record
1952
to
1956,
goodrich
and
firestone
together
sold
to
texaco,
$245
million
worth
of
tba
under
this
plan
and
these
two
companies
paid
to
texaco
in
this
period
approximately
$22
million
in
commissions
for
the
services
that
texaco
performed
under
the
contract.
now,
in
evaluating
the
commission's
decision
in
this
case
and
in
analyzing
this
court's
decision
in
atlantic,
the
parties
have
agreed
that
it
maybe
appropriately
broken
down
into
three
elements;
three
elements
in
necessary
to
sustain
the
commission's
determination
of
violation.
first,
did
texaco
have
controlling
economic
power
over
its
dealers?
secondly,
in
the
performance
of
the
sales-commission
contract,
did
texaco
exercise
that
power?
and
third,
was
there
an
adverse
effect
upon
competition?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
ruled
that
texaco
just
as
atlantic
did
have
dominant
economic
power
over
its
dealers
that
the
record
shows
that
in
this
case
the
dealer
is
no
less
than
atlantic
were
completely
depending
upon
the
oil
company
for
their
economic
survival.
and
i
just
like
to
correct
something
that
i
said
in
my
earlier
announcement
as
to
these
leases
which
i
apparently
miss
spoke
myself.
the
precise
terms
of
the
lease
are
that
they
run
from
year
to
year
but
they
are
automatically
terminable
10
days
before
the
end
of
the
year.
and
the
gasoline
contract
similarly
ran
from
year
to
year
and
a
terminable
30
days
before
the
end
of
the
year.
i
don't
want
to
have
any
suggestion
that
they
could
be
terminated
within
the
period
of
the
yearly
term.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
by
either
party.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
right.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
correct.
roughly
60%
are
either
owners
of
the
property
or
lessees
from
third
persons
and
roughly
40%
about
13,000
up
to
30,000
all
lessees
from
texaco.
but
the
--
in
their
fundamental
characteristics,
these
agreements
are
the
same,
they
are
short
term,
they
have
the
housekeeping
provisions
and
of
course
as
this
court
has
noted
on
several
occasions
these
gasoline
station
people
are
small
businessmen
in
every
sense
of
the
word.
they
have
what
for
then
as
a
very
substantial
investment
in
their
service
station
and
the
service
station
itself
is
a
relatively
expensive
proposition
and
as
this
court
correctly
pointed
out
we
think
in
atlantic
as
result
of
all
these
disparities
these
two
people
do
not
just
bargain
as
equals.
there's
a
tremendous
disparity
in
bargaining
power
and
in
these
circumstances
understandably
the
service
station
dealers
are
reluctant
to
do
anything
that
might
antagonize
their
relationship
with
the
oil
company
dealers.
now,
since
the
court
of
appeals
has
found
in
this
case
and
upheld
the
commission's
determination
that
the
oil
company
has
this
economic
power
of
its
dealers,
the
two
remaining
issues
in
this
case
is
whether
the
trade
commission
was
wanted
in
concluding
in
the
light
of
the
atlantic
decision
that
what
they
did,
what
texaco
did
in
this
case
in
performing
the
sales
commission
agreement
constituted
an
exercise
of
that
power
and
also
that
in
the
result
of
such
exercise
was
to
cause
a
serious
impediment
to
competition.
and
in
approaching
that
problem,
i
think
it's
appropriate
once
again
to
stress
the
limited
nature
of
judicial
review
of
the
commission's
determination
that
a
particular
practice
is
an
unfair
method
of
competition.
this
court
in
atlantic
pointed
out
that
where
the
congress
has
provided
that
an
administrative
agency
initially
apply
a
broad
statutory
term
to
a
particular
situation
our
function
is
limited
to
determining
whether
the
commission's
decision
has
warned
in
the
record
and
a
reasonable
basis
in
loew,
it
went
on
to
say
that
while
the
final
word
is
left
to
the
court
necessarily
we
give
great
discretion
to
the
commission's
determinations.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
oh!
yes
and
we
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it's
difficult
to
say
how
--
there's
no
question
that
they
did.
in
fact,
the
examiner
found
that
all
of
them
handled
some
tba
that
was
so-called
nonsponsored.
but
the
evidence
indicates
that
much
of
this
handling
of
the
so-called
nonsponsored
product
was
in
fact
the
so-called
occasional
pickup
business
that
customer
came
in
and
wanted
a
couple
of
tires
or
needed
some
sparkplug
or
something
that
need
to
fill,
fill
it
in.
there's
no
qualitative
a
data
in
this
record
as
to
precisely
to
what
percentage
of
the
dealers
or
what
percentage
of
total
tba
was
sponsored.
but
we
do
have
the
fact
that
over
five-year
period
as
i
indicated
they
sold
a
total
of
$245
million
worth
of
tba
through
the
texaco
outlets.
now,
i'd
like
at
the
very
outset
to
point
out
and
acknowledge
that
this
case
in
a
number
of
respect
to
significantly
different
than
atlantic
insofar
as
the
exercise
of
the
power
is
concerned
and
insofar
as
what
the
effects
upon
competition
were.
in
the
first
case,
we
make
no
claim
in
this
case
now
that
there
was
any
coercion
by
texaco
of
its
dealers.
that
is
dealers
were
not
threatened
that
they
would
have
their
leases
cancelled
if
they
should
handle
competing
products.
secondly,
we
don't
have
here
what
we
had
in
atlantic
the
policing
by
the
oil
company
of
its
dealers.
they
did
not
for
example
receive
information
from
the
tire
company
as
to
dealers
to
whom
the
tire
company
couldn't
sell
and
take
steps
to
do
that.
they
didn't
have
the
so-called
phantom
inspectors
going
around
and
checking
in
that
sense
on
the
company.
there's
nothing
here
to
show
that
texaco
would
pull
down
signs
advertising
competing
products.
and
in
addition
to
that
unlike
atlantic,
we
don't
have
here
a
dramatic
shift
in
business
following
the
initiation
of
the
sales-commission
plan
in
atlantic.
this
court
will
recall
it
as
tremendous
shift
in
business
over
a
period
of
a
year
when
the
sales-commission
plan
was
initiated.
we
don't
have
that
here.
now,
on
the
impact
on
competition,
in
atlantic,
there
were
an
impact
that
three
levels
in
this
case,
there's
only
an
impact
at
one.
in
atlantic,
what
happened
was
atlantic
divided
its
operating
territories
between
goodyear
on
the
one
hand
and
firestone
on
the
other
hand
and
thus
eliminated
all
inter-brand
competition
between
the
two
tire
companies.
we
did
not
have
that
here.
secondly,
in
atlantic,
the
arrangement
was
that
each
dealer
was
assigned
to
a
special
supply
point,
he
had
a
purchase
from
one
source
of
goodyear
or
firestone
and
that
had
the
effect
of
course
of
eliminating
all
intrabrand
competition
between
dealers
in
the
particular
rubber
companies
such
as
goodyear
in
competing
for
the
custom
of
a
single
dealer.
but
what
we
do
have
here
and
what
the
commission
pitches
its
case
on
is
the
impact
on
competition
upon
the
competing
suppliers
of
tba.
that
is
the
people
who
were
competing
with
goodrich
and
firestone
to
sell
to
the
texaco
stations.
the
commission
pointed
ruled
that
the
differences,
the
factual
differences
between
this
case
in
atlantic
were
immaterial
because
it
said
that
the
texaco
sales-commission
on
agreement
and
the
words
that
used
were,
in
its
fundamental
operation
and
effect
is
indistinguishable
from
the
one
held
unlawful
in
atlantic.
the
commission
interpreted
this
court's
atlantic
decision
in
effect
is
holding
his
files.
it
said
that
this
court
rule
that
while
coercive
practices
aggravate
the
restraint
imposed
by
the
sales-commission
plan.
it
is
the
oil
company's
power
over
its
dealers,
derived
from
the
contractual
relationship
between
them
and
the
utilization
of
that
power
through
the
performance
of
the
promotional
services
required
by
the
sales-commission
agreement
which
renders
the
sales-commission
plan
unlawful.
in
other
words,
the
commission
held
here
is
what
this
court
we
think
recognized
in
the
atlantic
but
the
basic
vice
of
the
sales-commission
plan
was
the
utilization
of
economic
power
in
one
market
the
gasoline
market
to
restrain
competition
in
another
market,
the
tba
market.
and
we
think
that
the
commission
properly
drew
that
conclusion
here
because
texaco
no
less
than
atlantic
we
think,
brought
its
economic
power
over
its
dealers
to
bear
in
a
way
that
gave
the
goodrich
company
and
firestone
company
a
competitive
advantage
over
other
sellers
of
tba
and
selling
to
the
importance
segment
of
the
tba
market
that
was
represented
by
the
numerous
texaco
service
stations
which
were
located
basically
throughout
most
of
the
country.
now,
the
commission
summarized
at
considerable
length
how
texaco
had
used
its
economic
power
in
the
performance
of
the
sales-commission
contract.
it
listed;
i'll
refer
to
six
instances.
the
first
thing
is
that
even
before
the
dealer
was
signed
up
for
as
a
dealer,
the
texaco
people
stressed
to
him
the
importance
of
carrying
adequate
stock
of
tba
and
also
urged
upon
him
to
select
either
goodrich
or
firestone.
and
if
he
does
select
one
of
these
two
sponsored
brands,
texaco
takes
the
initiative
and
introduces
him
to
the
representative
of
the
rubber
company.
before
the
station
is
actually
opened,
texaco
frequently
informs
either
or
both
of
goodrich
and
firestone
of
the
opening
of
such
station
although
the
record
does
also
indicate
that
in
many
instances,
the
rubber
companies
were
aware
of
this
themselves
and
made
the
first
sales
pitch.
texaco
actively
promote,
participates
in
the
promotion
campaigns
of
firestone
and
goodrich.
at
their
various
dealer
meetings,
they
have
training
courses
at
those
courses
of
the
sponsored
products
are
frequently
used
for
the
training
and
display
purposes.
and
in
addition
to
that,
representatives
of
the
rubber
companies
frequently
attend
this
meeting.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
it's
advertising
--
it
varies
again,
they
frequently
do
advertise
the
sponsored
products
and
let
me
say
mr.
chief
justice,
we
don't
claim
that
this
is
the
only
thing
in
the
record.
there's
evidence
in
the
record
of
course
that
they
do
advertise
nonsponsored
products
but
we
think
as
i
shall
develop
that
this
is
really
immaterial
at
the
critical
thing
is
that
they
did
play
a
very
active
role
in
promoting
the
sale
of
the
sponsored
products
to
their
dealers.
and
finally,
the
commission
said,
perhaps
most
effective
of
all
that
texaco
salesman
continually
carries
the
message
in
his
day
to
day
contacts
with
the
dealers.
in
this
regard
is
important
to
remember
that
these
texaco
salesmen
who
were
most
directly
involved
in
pushing
the
sponsored
tba
products
also
play
a
critical
role
in
the
annual
dealer
evaluations
and
in
determination
of
whether
the
dealer's
list
and
contractual
relations
with
texaco
are
to
be
renewed.
and
the
commission
concluded
that
the
consequence
of
these
promotional
efforts
by
texaco
was
to
impress
upon
texaco
dealers
through
constant
repetition
and
in
a
variety
of
ways
that
texaco
whose
favor
the
dealer
must
court
has
a
strong
interest
in
their
purchase
of
the
sponsored
products.
now,
the
record
in
this
case
indicates
that
although
texaco
did
inform
its
dealers
that
they
are
independent
businessmen
who
had
the
freedom
to
select
what
other
brand
of
tba
they
wanted.
in
fact,
its
performance
to
this
contract,
its
recommendation,
its
promotion,
its
sponsorship
of
the
goodrich
and
firestone
products
did
put
competing
distributors
of
tba
at
a
very
definite
disadvantage
in
selling
to
texaco
outlets.
the
commission
called
31
witnesses
who
are
representatives
of
competing
wholesale
sellers
of
tba.
these
witnesses
testified
basically
as
to
the
difficulties
they
had
in
selling
to
texaco
outlets.
they
testified
that
in
some
instances
there
were
outlets
to
whom
they
couldn't
sell
at
all.
they
testified
as
to
other
texaco
outlets,
they
would
sell
them
on
occasional
item
that
they
couldn't
get
them
to
stock
the
products.
they
testified
as
to
numerous
instances
where
they
receive
and
stop
calling
upon
the
texaco
outlets
because
they
just
found
it
was
a
waste
of
time,
they
couldn't
sell
to
them.
and
then
they
testified
into
some
instances
not
too
many
admittedly
but
a
substantial
number
in
which
the
firestone
--
i'm
sorry
which
the
texaco
dealers
explain
that
they
would
unwilling
to
purchase
the
competing
products
because
of
the
fact
they
were
told
they
had
to
carry
a
sponsored
brand.
and
i
think
the
commission
fairly
summarized
this
evidence
when
it
said
page
91
of
volume
6
of
this
little
document
that
we
have
here
which
contains
most
of
the
things
is
that
--
that
as
a
result,
many
texaco
dealers
as
result
of
texaco
vigorous
sales
campaign
to
its
dealers,
many
texaco
dealers
were
left
with
the
impression
that
texaco
would
look
with
disfavor
upon
their
purchase
of
nonsponsored
tba
products
and
that
they
were
acquired
to
purchase
the
sponsored
tba.
now,
the
practical
effectiveness
program
i
think
is
well
brought
out
in
the
testimony
of
a
man
named
richard
tidwell
which
is
set
forth
in
volume
2
of
the
record.
mr.
tidwell
was
an
airline
pilot
who
went
into
the
service
station
business.
he
was
a
lease
dealer
for
two
years
and
then
left
because
he
wanted
to
go
back
into
flying.
and
he
testified
that
when
he
was
interviewed
they
explained
to
him
the
advantages
of
tba
recommended
goodrich
or
firestone
and
he
selected
firestone.
at
a
later
point,
he
considered
the
possibility
of
taking
on
a
cheaper
brand
of
tires.
and
at
page
1211
of
the
record
at
the
top
of
the
page
he
explained
what
happened.
he
said,
“i
was
thinking
seriously
about
putting
in
a
line
of
the
second
cheaper
brand
of
tires.”
and
i
explain
this
to
mr.
fitz
for
authentically
he
was
a
texaco
representative
there.
he
told
me
at
that
time
and
i
will
say
this
much
in
his
words
as
possibly
said,
“dick,
we
cannot
tell
you
not
to
handle
these
tires
but
we
attempt
to
be
more
lenient
or
look
with
favor
on
our
dealers
who
are
more
loyal
to
us.”
as
a
consequence,
i
told
them
that
i
would
not
handle
the
tires.
and
then
down
at
the
bottom
of
the
page,
mr.
tidwell
was
asked,
“mr.
tidwell,
why
didn't
you
ever
carry
any
other
brand
of
tba
in
your
station
other
than
firestone?”
the
top
of
page
1212
he
said,
“when
i
found
out
that
the
texas
company
desired
me
to
carry
only
one
line,
i
endeavored
to
work
with
them.”
and
the
same
thought
was
repeated
at
the
top
the
latter
part
of
page
1217
when
mr.
tidwell
was
asked,
“why
he
had
asked
from
mr.
fitz'
advice
about
handling
these
competing
tires?”
he
said,
“i
asked
for
two
reasons.
one,
i
had
confidence
in
this
judgment.
the
other
is
if
he
had
any
objections
because
i
wanted
to
stay
on
good
standing
with
the
texaco
company.”
now,
this
is
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
tidwell
--
the
employee
was
a
mr.
fitz
who
had
the
position
of
being
manager
of
the
goodyear
bulk
refinery
i'm
sorry,
goodrich
bulk
refinery
in
the,
i'
sorry
texaco
bulk
refinery
in
the
area
where
he
was
working.
he
was
a
texaco
official
with
whom
he
had
dealt
in
negotiating
his
lease.
now,
indeed,
it's
rather
difficult
to
understand
why
these
two
large
companies
would
pay
$22
million
to
the
texaco
company
if
they
didn't
think
that
in
return
for
this
day
the
were
getting
some
advantage
that
they
could
not
have
gotten
for
their
own
sales
efforts.
this
court
in
atlantic
pointed
this
out
when
it's
stated
that
it
is
difficult
to
escape
the
conclusion
that
there
would
have
been
little
point
in
paying
substantial
commissions
to
oil
companies
were
it
not
for
their
ability
to
exert
power
over
their
wholesalers
and
dealers
and
ability
adequately
demonstrated
on
this
record.
the
court
of
appeals
however
rejected
the
commission's
finding
that
texaco
had
exercised
its
economic
power
basically
on
two
grounds.
first,
the
court
said
page
112
of
this
little
sixth
volume
of
the
appendix,
the
court
of
appeals
said,
“a
finding
of
coercion
is
the
threshold
requirement
of
a
determination
of
exercise
of
dominant
economic
power.”
it
read
this
court's
in
atlantic
decision
as
so
holding
and
since
it's
set
aside
the
commission's
finding
that
there
have
been
done
--
that
there
have
been
coercion
it
concluded
as
the
first
ground
that
the
finding
of
exercise
economic
power
could
not
stand.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
would
think
that
the
commission
feature
plays
a
critical
role
in
this.
i
don't
know
what
the
commission
--
the
trade
commission
would
do
on
this
but
it
seems
to
me
it's
a
very
different
case
where
the
oil
company
makes
an
independent
judgment
and
says
to
its
dealers,
we
recommend
one
product
rather
than
another
or
where
this
being
paid
to
do
this.
i
think
the
--
mr.
justice,
the
impact
upon
competition
presumably
would
be
the
same
but
you
don't
have
this
other
element
and
i
want
to
say
that
the
commission
of
course
has
not
undertaken
to
decide
this
question.
now,
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
might
be
mr.
justice
but
i
just
don't
know
what
the
commission
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
significance
of
paying
of
this
loss,
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
that
the
--
well,
there
are
two
things
about
it.
first,
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
and
i
will
put
it
the
other
way
if
i
may
that
the
fact
--
that
the
suppliers
were
willing
to
pay
the
substantial
amount.
it
seems
to
us
it's
a
pretty
clear
indication
that
the
suppliers
felt
that
in
the
performance
of
these
agreements
texaco
is
giving
something
that
they
could
not
obtain
themselves
through
its
economic
power.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
oh!
of
course.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
no.
of
course
they
did.
they
did
all
the
things
--
i'm
sorry,
they
did
all
the
things
i've
indicated
in
performing
the
contract
which
apparently
was
satisfactory
to
both
goodrich
and
firestone.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
think
that
the
basic
rational
of
atlantic,
be
the
facts
in
this
case
are
different
we
think.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
mr.
justice
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
these
are
different
cases,
i
tried
and
i
think
i
successfully
urged
upon
the
court
in
atlantic
at
least
it
was
my
submission
that
the
atlantic
case
involved
only
the
facts
of
atlantic.
it
didn't
have
to
go
beyond
the
facts
of
atlantic.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
involved
coercion,
yes.
but
we
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
think
mr.
justice
the
opinion
in
atlantic
said
that
without
regard
to
coercion
neither
the
coercion
was
not
the
essential
element
of
the
violation,
coercion
was
merely
a
symptom,
a
form
in
which
the
oil
company
exercise
its
power.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
i
don't
--
i'm
not
suggesting
that
atlantic
holds,
that
atlantic
covers
this
case
in
the
sense
that
the
decision
in
atlantic
controls
this
case.
what
i
do
suggest
is
the
basic
reasoning
and
rational
of
atlantic
covers
this
case.
i'd
like
to
also
add
mr.
justice
that
in
firestone
case
the
fifth
circuit
held
that
the
absence
of
coercion
was
not
fatal.
no,
it's
the
fifth
circuit
did
not
read
this
opinion
--
court's
opinion
in
atlantic
as
holding
that
even
without
coercion
nevertheless
the
commission
might
condemn
the
system.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
you
have
to
show
some
exercise
of
the
power.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
the
findings
of
the
commission,
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
we
think
what
they
have
done
here
while
not
as
much
as
obviously
as
they
did
in
atlantic.
nevertheless,
is
enough
to
warrant
the
commission
in
concluding
that
this
had
a
sufficiently
significant
impact
on
competition.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
well
--
they
have
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
if
that
maybe
mr.
justice
if
that
were
all
the
record
show,
do
we
think
the
record
here
shows
it
could
been
more
had
we
think
they
did
fully
perform
their
obligation
under
the
sales-commission
contract
to
promote
the
sale
of
tba
and
there
as
i
say
they
performed
the
obligations
insufficiently
satisfactory
manner
to
the
oil
companies
that
they're
willing
to
pay
substantial
amount.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
the
promotional
activities
would
be
and
that's
basically
what
the
commission
held
here.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
that's
right,
the
promotional
activities
plus
of
course
the
effect
on
competition.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
right.
they
promoted
the
contract
in
the
context
of
their
economic
relationship
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
right.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it's
the
dominant
economic
power,
the
power
that
texaco
have.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i'm
sorry.
i
don't
understand
your
question.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
when
you
exercise
the
dominant
power
over
the
dealers
and
the
result
of
which
is
--
the
result
of
which
is
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
if
they
don't
feel
free
--
they
don't
have
a
free
choice
when
they
come
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
depending,
it
may
depend
on
how
you
use
the
term.
it's
not
overt
coercion,
it's
not
coercion
in
the
sense
that
the
court
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
it's
not
so
much
something
like
don't
want
to
do.
i
think
there
is
and
i
think
the
reason
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
he
has
it
--
doesn't
have
the
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it's
coercion
in
that
sense
but
coercion
has
been
used
in
this
case
i
think
primarily
to
refer
to
so-called
overt
coercion
and
that
is
if
you
might
use
the
word,
the
real
clubbing
as
distinguished
from
the
gentler
touch.
the
--
now,
there's
another
aspect
of
the
commission's
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
decision
which
is
the
court
of
appeals
seem
to
think
and
we
of
course
disagree
that
this
court
in
its
atlantic
decision
defined
the
precise
limits
of
the
commission's
power
to
condemn
a
sales-commission
plan.
and
then
they
review
all
of
the
acts
that
texaco
had
done,
line
them
up
against
the
acts
at
atlantic
had
done
say
this
was
significantly
different
and
therefore
concluded
that
the
commission
could
not
treat
this
an
exercise
of
the
economic
power
of
texaco.
again,
we
think
that's
not
what
atlantic
held.
atlantic
merely
decided
on
the
facts
before
it
that
the
commission
was
justified
and
we
think
the
court
of
appeals
here
has
approached
the
review
of
the
commission's
order
in
the
wrong
way.
it
seems
to
us
what
the
court
of
appeals
should've
done
has
not
looked
and
saying,
is
this
case
on
all
force
with
atlantic?
it
should've
said
is
despite
the
differences
between
this
case
and
atlantic
was
the
commission
justified
in
concluding
that
nevertheless
this
practice
--
this
sales-commission
system
did
constitute
a
sufficient
exercise
of
power
and
did
have
a
significantly
sufficient
impact
on
competition
to
warrant
condemning
it.
and
this
brings
me
to
the
third
element
of
the
equation
if
you
will.
the
effect
of
this
plan
on
competition,
now,
in
the
atlantic
case,
this
court
recognized
that
the
basic
impact
of
the
sales-commission
plan
upon
competition
was
comparable
to
a
tie-in
arrangement
that
is
in
each
case
the
person
who
was
doing
the
purchasing
felt
constrain
to
exercise,
to
make
his
choice
not
on
a
completely
free
basis
but
upon
some
feeling
that
he
had
to
do,
he
had
to
satisfy
the
oil
company.
and
it
therefore
concluded
that
in
determining
the
impact
on
competition,
it
was
appropriate
to
apply
in
this
area
the
standards
that
had
been
developed
in
the
tie-in
cases,
that
is
it
was
enough
to
show
that
a
not
insubstantial
amount
of
commerce
was
affected
and
it
was
unnecessary
for
the
commission
to
make
a
lengthy
and
protracted
analysis
of
the
market.
in
the
atlantic
case,
the
total
amount
of
sponsored
tba
that
was
sold
over
a
five-year
period
under
the
sales-commission
agreements
between
atlantic
and
goodyear
and
firestone
was
slightly
over
$50
million
over
five-year
period.
in
this
case,
in
one
year,
the
last
year
1956
the
total
sales
were
approximately
$58
million
and
over
the
five-year
period
the
total
sales
involved
in
this
case
were
almost
five
times
at
atlantic.
that
is
$245
million
as
against
$50
million
in
atlantic.
and
of
course
when
a
not
in
substantial
volume
of
commerce
is
tied
up
this
way,
the
effect
on
competition
is
enough
even
though
not
all
the
dealers
were
tied
up,
even
though
many
of
the
dealers
handle
competing
products
and
even
though
many
of
them
didn't
handle
sponsored
product
at
all.
the
critical
thing
we
think
from
this
record
is
that
the
effect
of
the
texaco
sales-commission
plan
has
been
effectively
defense
off
from
a
substantial
segment
of
the
tba
market
represented
by
texaco
dealers
competing
sellers
of
tba.
now,
there
are
two
other
factors
involved
in
considering
the
impact
on
competition
that
i
think
it's
appropriate
to
mention.
when
the
commission
decided
this
case
on
remand,
it
already
had
decided
the
two
other
tba
cases.
and
in
the
course
of
studying
these
three
cases
it
had
learned
a
great
deal
about
the
tba
industry
and
one
of
the
things
that
had
been
disclosed
in
the
course
of
these
three
cases
whether
it's
only
the
very
large
tire
companies
that
are
able
to
have
these
sales-commission
plans.
it
also
it's
clear
that
the
service
stations
by
their
nature
of
becoming
increasingly
important
outlets
for
the
distribution
of
tba.
and
thus,
it
becomes
more
and
more
important
to
the
competing
manufactures
of
tba,
the
smaller
manufacturers
who
were
not
able
to
enjoy
these
sales-commission
plans
that
we
eliminate
the
restraints
on
access
to
the
market
that
these
plans
represent.
in
the
atlantic
case,
this
court
referred
to
the
destructive
effect
on
commerce
that
would
result
from
the
widespread
use
of
these
contracts
by
major
oil
companies
in
supplies.
and
this
is
not
wholly
theoretical
because
we
do
have
in
this
case
the
evidence
that
a
small
battery
manufacture
in
texas
had
great
difficulty
in
selling
to
the
texaco
outlets.
in
addition,
there's
a
further
anomaly
in
this
situation
if
this
sales-commission
plan
is
permitted
to
go
forward
what
would
amounts
to
is
that
even
though
texaco
is
two
or
three
times
larger
than
atlantic,
texaco
is
permitted
to
engage
in
the
basic
kind
of
arrangement
that
is
prohibited
to
atlantic
and
some
of
the
other
companies.
and
finally,
i
think
it's
important
to
stress
the
basic
prophylactic
role
that
congress
intended
section
5
of
the
trade
commission
act
promote.
i
refer
to
justice
brandeis'
notable
dissent
in
the
gratz
case
which
this
court
only
two
or
three
years
ago
recognized
is
now
the
proper
approach.
that
is
under
section
5,
it's
not
necessary
to
await
until
the
point
that
a
restraint
of
trade
turns
into
a
full
blown
violation
of
the
sherman
act
or
the
clayton
act.
the
commission
can
step
in
and
even
at
a
preliminary
stage
because
of
the
dangerous
tendencies
which
it
practice
has
and
we
think
that
this
practice
--
this
practice,
there's
a
demonstrated
anticompetitive
effect
but
in
any
event,
the
possible
potential
dangers
of
these
plans
continue
as
this
court
recognized
in
atlantic
for
both
(inaudible)
for
both
the
competing
smaller
manufacturers
of
tba
and
the
wholesale
distributors
of
those
commodities.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
of
course
it
seems
--
i'd
like
to
answer
with
something
mr.
barton
said,
the
basic
question
here
isn't
whether
there's
been
misuse
of
economic
power.
this
--
no
one
has
being
punished
here.
the
commission
is
performing
the
prophylactic
function
of
freeing
our
economy
from
an
improper
restraints
and
the
question
is
whether
the
use
of
this
power
whether
the
use
of
this
power
together
with
what
a
fencing
law
from
part
of
the
competitive
area
whether
that's
enough
to
justify
the
commission
in
concluding
that
it's
an
unfair
method
of
competition.
now,
there's
been
a
lot
of
talk
about
some
of
the
evidence
in
this
case
and
i
just
like
to
go
back
to
a
couple
of
these
items
that
my
opponents
have
referred
to.
for
example,
this
man
mr.
tidwell
whom
they
say
felt
perfectly
free
to
carry
these
products
nonetheless.
at
page
1211,
after
the
passage
i
previously
referred
to,
he
was
asked,
“did
you
take
on
a
cheaper
line
of
tires?”
and
his
answer
was,
“not
in
stock
but
i
did
sell
some.”
and
then
three
or
four
lines
thereafter,
he
was
asked,
“did
you
ever
display
those
tires
in
your
station?”
he
says,
“no,
i
never
displayed
any
other
product
than
firestone.”
what
it
seem
to
us
is
very
clear
from
this.
what
he
was
saying
was
because
he
wanted
to
remain
in
the
good
graces
of
texaco.
he
would
not
take
these
products,
these
competing
products
on
as
a
display
product
that
will
be
generally
available
for
the
public
to
see.
sure,
he
would
occasionally
buy
some
of
these
products
and
that's
fully
consistent
with
the
testimony
of
these
wholesalers
that
yes,
they
could
sell,
they
could
sell
on
occasional
item
to
texaco
dealer,
to
many
texaco
dealers.
they
could
sell
a
few
things
that
the
people
wanted
to
stock
up
on
but
basically
there
were
substantial
testimony
in
this
record
that
these
people
did
not
have
the
same
opportunities
when
they
tried
to
penetrate
the
texaco
market
as
when
they
tried
to
penetrate
some
other
markets.
now,
what
are
these
dealers
do?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes
and
then
we
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
--we
think
so
mr.
justice
consistent
with
the
long
line
of
cases
in
this
court
which
have
reviewed
commission
decisions
under
section
5
is
to
what
the
commission'
authority.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
they
have
to
have
some
basis
for
their
expertise
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
don't
know
mr.
justice
because
they
have
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
but
i
think
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
it's
a
factual
matter
only
in
the
sense
that
you've
got
to
see
what
the
commission
had
but
it
seems
to
me
the
answer
we
think
is
that
in
this
kind
--
this
is
the
area
where
the
commission
has
very
great
discretion
as
to
evaluating
the
impact
of
this
practice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
i
don't
think
they
could
say
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
i
think
there
has
to
be
some
of
it.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
there
have
to
be
some
proof
as
to
what
the
impact
upon
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
if
it
challenge
that
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
but
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
say
there's
no
factual
basis
for
this.
the
court
of
appeals
said,
as
we
read
their
opinion
that
the
kind
of
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
they
--
no,
mr.
justice.
we
don't
think
they
said.
they
would
they
said
was
as
they
interpret
this
court's
atlantic
decision.
atlantic
required
the
commission
to
come
up
with
a
certain
type
of
evidence
with
the
certain
quantum
of
evidence
and
then
they
said,
"we
don't
think
that
what
the
commission
had
before
in
this
case
was
enough."
they
did
not
attempt
to
say,
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
attempt
to
say,
we
don't
think
there's
any
evidence
here
to
show
either
that
texaco
in
performing
this
contract
was
engaging
in
these
promotional
activities
or
that
there
was
not
any
competitive
effect.
they
said,
looking
on
what
the
commission
were
acted
on,
looking
on
what
the
commission
found
happened
here,
what
texaco
did,
we
don't
think
this
is
enough
as
a
matter
of
law
basically
to
constitute
an
unfair
method
of
competition.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
it
was
30%
--
let
me
explain
it.
it
was
30%
of
all
the
dealers
who
were
service
station
dealers
but
the
commission
explained
that
that
figure
was
distorted
because
of
significant
number
of
those
dealers
with
so-called
contract
dealers
who
would
not
handle
tba
for
example,
the
grocery
store
but
had
a
couple
of
gasoline
pump.
so,
the
commission
indicated
the
figure
was
higher
than
that.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
the
type
of
plan
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
don't
--
i
think
the
difference
maybe
mr.
justice
these
plans
are
not
always
completely
effective.
this
was
true
in
atlantic
too.
and
atlantic
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
suppose
to
some
extent
it
may
depend
on
the
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
take
it
again
it
may
depend
on
what
the
reaction
of
the
individual
dealer
is
to
the
situation.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
would
--
i
have
to
say
mr.
justice
in
all
candid
that
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
i'd
say
in
all
candid
mr.
justice
that
the
record
does
indicate
that
where
a
particular
customer
wanted
a
particular
single
tire,
one
customer
generally
speaking
most
of
the
dealers
would
go
out
and
stock
and
buy
this
particular
type
of
tire
even
though
they
didn't
stock
them.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
then
maybe
if
the
other
thing
i
suppose
mr.
justice
is
of
course
goodrich
and
firestone
are
popular
products.
ome
of
the
dealers
may
have
been
well
satisfied
to
take
this.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
no
i
don't
mr.
justice
because
it
seems
to
us
what
we
have
here
is
one,
the
relationship
and
we
can
see
they
did
tell
many
dealers
that
they
were
free
to
buy
what
they
wanted
but
apparently
the
record
strongly
indicates
that
despite
the
statement
many
of
the
dealers
did
not
feel
they
had
a
complete
freedom.
the
--
these
31
wholesalers
that
mr.
handler
tends
to
distinguish
some
of
the
incidents
but
some
of
them
can
be
distinguished.
there
were
explanations
but
there
are
a
lot
of
them.
there
are
a
lot
of
them
that
just
cannot
be
distinguished.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
the
record
does
not
show
whether
they
had
any
knowledge
of
that.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
the
record
does
not
show
that.
the
record
does
not
show
that
mr.
justice.
i'd
just
like
to
read
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
that
would
make
our
case
even
stronger
i
think
if
in
fact
the
dealers
knew
that
texaco
was
in
fact
getting
a
substantial
amount
on
the
sales.
i
just
--
the
record
does
not
show
that
mr.
justice.
i
just
like
to
read
to
the
court
that
pages
552
to
553
of
the
record
where
the
example
of
this
wholesaler
testimony.
one
of
the
witnesses
was
being
asked
why
he
had
stopped
calling
on
the
texaco
dealers
and
he
said
at
the
bottom
of
the
page,
when
you
make
a
hundred
calls
and
they
show
no
signs
of
business
and
then
maybe
continue
to
make
calls
another
hundred
and
still
are
told
from
time
to
time
that
they
can't
buy
your
tires
that
they
have
to
buy
goodrich,
i
think
it
is
time
to
give
up
on
it.
and
he
was
questioned,
by
whom
are
you
giving
such
information
as
you
just
related
answered
by
the
texaco
stations
that
we
called
on
it.
it
seems
to
us
that
this
record
fully
supports
the
commission's
conclusion
that
a
very
large
number
of
texaco
dealers
felt
constraint
not
to
buy
competing
tba
products.
and
i
think
the
record
fully
supports
the
commission
and
it
seems
to
us
that
the
court
of
appeals
the
appropriate
for
court
of
appeals
should've
put
the
inquiry
whether
the
commission
was
justified
in
the
light
of
these
facts
shown
by
the
record
in
concluding
that
this
particular
practice
had
a
sufficiently
pernicious
effect
actual
and
potential
on
competition
to
warrant
condemning
it
not
to
try
to
line
this
thing
up
and
saying
they
have
done
everything
here
that
they
did
in
atlantic
and
the
court
of
appeals
said,
"no,
they
haven't
and
that's
the
end
of
this.
this
is
not
just
a
fact
cases,
it
entails
basically
the
question
of
what
the
scope
of
review
of
commission
determinations
is
an
unfair
methods
in
competition
and
the
commission's
discretion
to
define
those
terms.
and
so
it
seems
to
us
that
in
this
case
the
commission
was
fully
warranted
in
concluding
that
this
situation
no
less
than
atlantic
was
an
unfair
method
of
competition
and
that
the
same
kind
of
order
should
be
entered.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
think
mr.
justice
the
commission
could
sell
conclude.
i
do
want
to
make
it
very
explicit.
the
commission
has
not
passed
upon
that
issue.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
think
the
commission
could
so
conclude,
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
does.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
don't
know
mr.
justice.
i
think
as
they
approach
and
begin
to
require
a
greater
and
greater
line
you
got
into
problems
with
it.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
fortunately,
the
commission
has
not
yet
had
to
face
up
to
this
problem.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
thank
you.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
in
this
case
which
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
is
whether
the
federal
trade
commission
correctly
held
that
a
sales-commission
plan
by
which
the
respondent,
texaco
distributed,
promoted
--
not
distributed,
i'm
sorry,
promoted
and
sponsored
the
sale
of
tires,
batteries
and
automotive
accessories
made
by
the
respondent,
goodrich
tire
and
rubber
company.
promoted
and
sponsored
the
sale
through
the
texaco
service
stations
in
return
for
a
commission
paid
to
texaco
by
goodrich
whether
the
commission
properly
held
that
this
constituted
an
unfair
method
of
competition
in
violation
section
5
of
the
trade
commission
act.
the
respondent
texaco
or
respondent
goodrich
also
had
a
similar
sales
commission
plan
with
the
firestone
rubber
and
tire
company
but
i
will
focus
primarily
in
this
case
on
their
relationships
with
goodrich.
this
case
is
one
of
three
companion
cases
that
the
commission
instituted
in
1956
challenging
the
sales-commission
method
of
distributing
tires,
batteries
and
automotive
accessories
which
are
commonly
referred
to
as
tba
in
the
industry.
and
each
of
these
cases
named
as
a
respondent
a
major
oil
company
and
a
major
tire
company.
in
each
case
after
protracted
proceedings,
the
trade
commission
held
that
the
sales-commission
plan
was
an
unfair
method
of
competition
and
entered
a
broad
cease
and
deceased
order
which
prohibited
each
of
these
companies
from
engaging
in
this
type
of
plan.
at
the
end
of
the
1964
term,
this
court
upheld
the
commission’s
order
directed
against
the
plan
involving
atlantic
refining
company
and
the
goodyear
tire
and
rubber
company.
subsequent
thereto,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
upheld
the
commission's
order
directed
against
the
plan
involving
the
shell
oil
company
and
firestone.
now,
while
those
two
cases
were
going
through
the
courts,
in
the
present
case,
the
texaco-goodrich
case,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
on
a
prior
appeal
set
aside
the
commission’s
order.
the
commission
filed
a
petition
for
certiorari
in
that
case
and
a
week
after
this
court
decided
the
atlantic
case
in
favor
of
the
commission
it
vacated
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
in
effect
remanded
the
case
to
the
commission
with
directions
to
reconsider
it
in
the
light
of
atlantic.
upon
such
reconsideration,
the
commission
issued
a
new
opinion
and
which
it
again
in
the
light
of
atlantic
concluded
that
this
sales-commission
system
was
an
unfair
method
of
competition
and
added
a
cease
and
deceased
order
the
same
as
the
order
that
had
been
upheld
by
this
court
in
atlantic.
once
again,
the
court
of
appeals
set
aside
the
commission’s
order
and
directed
the
commission
to
dismiss
the
complaint.
now,
the
economic
relationship
that
exists
between
the
respondent
texaco
and
its
retail
gasoline
service
station
dealers
is
basically
the
same
as
that
was
presented
to
this
court
in
the
atlantic
case.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
those
--
i'm
speaking
mr.
justice
of
just
the
economic
relationship
the
first
element,
the
power
relationship
between
the
company
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
and
the
dealers.
i
will
come
in
a
moment
and
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
explain
the
differences
in
the
way
in
which
the
power
was
exercised.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
texaco
is
one
of
the
largest
petroleum
dealers
in
the
country.
it
distributes
its
products
to
30,000
service
stations
many
more
than
involve
in
atlantic.
in
fact,
this
represents
about
one-sixth
of
all
the
service
stations
in
the
country.
these
service
stations
operate
on
two
bases
as
in
atlantic
about
40%
of
them
are
so-called
lessee
dealers
who
lease
their
station
from
atlantic,
the
remainder
are
so-called
contract
dealers
who
either
lease
their
station
from
a
third
person
or
in
fact
on
a
station.
the
way
in
which
the
stations
are
lease
here
is
the
same
as
basically
as
in
atlantic,
the
dealers
hold
the
stations
under
short-term
leases,
one-year
leases
which
permit
termination
by
either
side
upon
10
days
notice.
the
leases
have
similar
housekeeping
clauses
which
permit
immediate
cancellation
if
the
lessee
fails
to
comply
with
these
situations.
in
a
different
--
in
addition,
in
each
instance
of
course
the
dealer
is
completely
dependent
upon
texaco
for
its
supply
of
gasoline.
thereto,
they
have
a
yearly
contract
which
is
terminable
by
the
oil
company
on
30
days
notice.
the
sales
commission
plain
in
this
case
was
originally
entered
into
a
1940
and
it
was
renewed
in
1943.
and
under
the
plan,
goodrich
agrees
to
pay
texaco
a
10%
commission
on
all
goodrich
tba
that
is
sold
through
the
texaco
gasoline
stations
or
through
wholesale
outlets
and
this
payment
it
stated
in
the
sales
commission
agreement
is
in
consideration
of
the
aid
to
be
given
and
the
services
to
be
rendered
by
your
sales
organization
in
connection
with
promoting
the
sale
of
goodrich
products.
and
as
i've
indicated
to
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
will
shortly
come
to
what
they
did
in
carrying
out
this
obligation
to
promote
the
sale
of
products.
now,
during
the
five
year
period
for
which
date
is
in
the
record
1952
to
1956,
goodrich
and
firestone
together
sold
to
texaco,
$245
million
worth
of
tba
under
this
plan
and
these
two
companies
paid
to
texaco
in
this
period
approximately
$22
million
in
commissions
for
the
services
that
texaco
performed
under
the
contract.
now,
in
evaluating
the
commission's
decision
in
this
case
and
in
analyzing
this
court's
decision
in
atlantic,
the
parties
have
agreed
that
it
maybe
appropriately
broken
down
into
three
elements;
three
elements
in
necessary
to
sustain
the
commission's
determination
of
violation.
first,
did
texaco
have
controlling
economic
power
over
its
dealers?
secondly,
in
the
performance
of
the
sales-commission
contract,
did
texaco
exercise
that
power?
and
third,
was
there
an
adverse
effect
upon
competition?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
ruled
that
texaco
just
as
atlantic
did
have
dominant
economic
power
over
its
dealers
that
the
record
shows
that
in
this
case
the
dealer
is
no
less
than
atlantic
were
completely
depending
upon
the
oil
company
for
their
economic
survival.
and
i
just
like
to
correct
something
that
i
said
in
my
earlier
announcement
as
to
these
leases
which
i
apparently
miss
spoke
myself.
the
precise
terms
of
the
lease
are
that
they
run
from
year
to
year
but
they
are
automatically
terminable
10
days
before
the
end
of
the
year.
and
the
gasoline
contract
similarly
ran
from
year
to
year
and
a
terminable
30
days
before
the
end
of
the
year.
i
don't
want
to
have
any
suggestion
that
they
could
be
terminated
within
the
period
of
the
yearly
term.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
by
either
party.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
right.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
correct.
roughly
60%
are
either
owners
of
the
property
or
lessees
from
third
persons
and
roughly
40%
about
13,000
up
to
30,000
all
lessees
from
texaco.
but
the
--
in
their
fundamental
characteristics,
these
agreements
are
the
same,
they
are
short
term,
they
have
the
housekeeping
provisions
and
of
course
as
this
court
has
noted
on
several
occasions
these
gasoline
station
people
are
small
businessmen
in
every
sense
of
the
word.
they
have
what
for
then
as
a
very
substantial
investment
in
their
service
station
and
the
service
station
itself
is
a
relatively
expensive
proposition
and
as
this
court
correctly
pointed
out
we
think
in
atlantic
as
result
of
all
these
disparities
these
two
people
do
not
just
bargain
as
equals.
there's
a
tremendous
disparity
in
bargaining
power
and
in
these
circumstances
understandably
the
service
station
dealers
are
reluctant
to
do
anything
that
might
antagonize
their
relationship
with
the
oil
company
dealers.
now,
since
the
court
of
appeals
has
found
in
this
case
and
upheld
the
commission's
determination
that
the
oil
company
has
this
economic
power
of
its
dealers,
the
two
remaining
issues
in
this
case
is
whether
the
trade
commission
was
wanted
in
concluding
in
the
light
of
the
atlantic
decision
that
what
they
did,
what
texaco
did
in
this
case
in
performing
the
sales
commission
agreement
constituted
an
exercise
of
that
power
and
also
that
in
the
result
of
such
exercise
was
to
cause
a
serious
impediment
to
competition.
and
in
approaching
that
problem,
i
think
it's
appropriate
once
again
to
stress
the
limited
nature
of
judicial
review
of
the
commission's
determination
that
a
particular
practice
is
an
unfair
method
of
competition.
this
court
in
atlantic
pointed
out
that
where
the
congress
has
provided
that
an
administrative
agency
initially
apply
a
broad
statutory
term
to
a
particular
situation
our
function
is
limited
to
determining
whether
the
commission's
decision
has
warned
in
the
record
and
a
reasonable
basis
in
loew,
it
went
on
to
say
that
while
the
final
word
is
left
to
the
court
necessarily
we
give
great
discretion
to
the
commission's
determinations.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
oh!
yes
and
we
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it's
difficult
to
say
how
--
there's
no
question
that
they
did.
in
fact,
the
examiner
found
that
all
of
them
handled
some
tba
that
was
so-called
nonsponsored.
but
the
evidence
indicates
that
much
of
this
handling
of
the
so-called
nonsponsored
product
was
in
fact
the
so-called
occasional
pickup
business
that
customer
came
in
and
wanted
a
couple
of
tires
or
needed
some
sparkplug
or
something
that
need
to
fill,
fill
it
in.
there's
no
qualitative
a
data
in
this
record
as
to
precisely
to
what
percentage
of
the
dealers
or
what
percentage
of
total
tba
was
sponsored.
but
we
do
have
the
fact
that
over
five-year
period
as
i
indicated
they
sold
a
total
of
$245
million
worth
of
tba
through
the
texaco
outlets.
now,
i'd
like
at
the
very
outset
to
point
out
and
acknowledge
that
this
case
in
a
number
of
respect
to
significantly
different
than
atlantic
insofar
as
the
exercise
of
the
power
is
concerned
and
insofar
as
what
the
effects
upon
competition
were.
in
the
first
case,
we
make
no
claim
in
this
case
now
that
there
was
any
coercion
by
texaco
of
its
dealers.
that
is
dealers
were
not
threatened
that
they
would
have
their
leases
cancelled
if
they
should
handle
competing
products.
secondly,
we
don't
have
here
what
we
had
in
atlantic
the
policing
by
the
oil
company
of
its
dealers.
they
did
not
for
example
receive
information
from
the
tire
company
as
to
dealers
to
whom
the
tire
company
couldn't
sell
and
take
steps
to
do
that.
they
didn't
have
the
so-called
phantom
inspectors
going
around
and
checking
in
that
sense
on
the
company.
there's
nothing
here
to
show
that
texaco
would
pull
down
signs
advertising
competing
products.
and
in
addition
to
that
unlike
atlantic,
we
don't
have
here
a
dramatic
shift
in
business
following
the
initiation
of
the
sales-commission
plan
in
atlantic.
this
court
will
recall
it
as
tremendous
shift
in
business
over
a
period
of
a
year
when
the
sales-commission
plan
was
initiated.
we
don't
have
that
here.
now,
on
the
impact
on
competition,
in
atlantic,
there
were
an
impact
that
three
levels
in
this
case,
there's
only
an
impact
at
one.
in
atlantic,
what
happened
was
atlantic
divided
its
operating
territories
between
goodyear
on
the
one
hand
and
firestone
on
the
other
hand
and
thus
eliminated
all
inter-brand
competition
between
the
two
tire
companies.
we
did
not
have
that
here.
secondly,
in
atlantic,
the
arrangement
was
that
each
dealer
was
assigned
to
a
special
supply
point,
he
had
a
purchase
from
one
source
of
goodyear
or
firestone
and
that
had
the
effect
of
course
of
eliminating
all
intrabrand
competition
between
dealers
in
the
particular
rubber
companies
such
as
goodyear
in
competing
for
the
custom
of
a
single
dealer.
but
what
we
do
have
here
and
what
the
commission
pitches
its
case
on
is
the
impact
on
competition
upon
the
competing
suppliers
of
tba.
that
is
the
people
who
were
competing
with
goodrich
and
firestone
to
sell
to
the
texaco
stations.
the
commission
pointed
ruled
that
the
differences,
the
factual
differences
between
this
case
in
atlantic
were
immaterial
because
it
said
that
the
texaco
sales-commission
on
agreement
and
the
words
that
used
were,
in
its
fundamental
operation
and
effect
is
indistinguishable
from
the
one
held
unlawful
in
atlantic.
the
commission
interpreted
this
court's
atlantic
decision
in
effect
is
holding
his
files.
it
said
that
this
court
rule
that
while
coercive
practices
aggravate
the
restraint
imposed
by
the
sales-commission
plan.
it
is
the
oil
company's
power
over
its
dealers,
derived
from
the
contractual
relationship
between
them
and
the
utilization
of
that
power
through
the
performance
of
the
promotional
services
required
by
the
sales-commission
agreement
which
renders
the
sales-commission
plan
unlawful.
in
other
words,
the
commission
held
here
is
what
this
court
we
think
recognized
in
the
atlantic
but
the
basic
vice
of
the
sales-commission
plan
was
the
utilization
of
economic
power
in
one
market
the
gasoline
market
to
restrain
competition
in
another
market,
the
tba
market.
and
we
think
that
the
commission
properly
drew
that
conclusion
here
because
texaco
no
less
than
atlantic
we
think,
brought
its
economic
power
over
its
dealers
to
bear
in
a
way
that
gave
the
goodrich
company
and
firestone
company
a
competitive
advantage
over
other
sellers
of
tba
and
selling
to
the
importance
segment
of
the
tba
market
that
was
represented
by
the
numerous
texaco
service
stations
which
were
located
basically
throughout
most
of
the
country.
now,
the
commission
summarized
at
considerable
length
how
texaco
had
used
its
economic
power
in
the
performance
of
the
sales-commission
contract.
it
listed;
i'll
refer
to
six
instances.
the
first
thing
is
that
even
before
the
dealer
was
signed
up
for
as
a
dealer,
the
texaco
people
stressed
to
him
the
importance
of
carrying
adequate
stock
of
tba
and
also
urged
upon
him
to
select
either
goodrich
or
firestone.
and
if
he
does
select
one
of
these
two
sponsored
brands,
texaco
takes
the
initiative
and
introduces
him
to
the
representative
of
the
rubber
company.
before
the
station
is
actually
opened,
texaco
frequently
informs
either
or
both
of
goodrich
and
firestone
of
the
opening
of
such
station
although
the
record
does
also
indicate
that
in
many
instances,
the
rubber
companies
were
aware
of
this
themselves
and
made
the
first
sales
pitch.
texaco
actively
promote,
participates
in
the
promotion
campaigns
of
firestone
and
goodrich.
at
their
various
dealer
meetings,
they
have
training
courses
at
those
courses
of
the
sponsored
products
are
frequently
used
for
the
training
and
display
purposes.
and
in
addition
to
that,
representatives
of
the
rubber
companies
frequently
attend
this
meeting.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
it's
advertising
--
it
varies
again,
they
frequently
do
advertise
the
sponsored
products
and
let
me
say
mr.
chief
justice,
we
don't
claim
that
this
is
the
only
thing
in
the
record.
there's
evidence
in
the
record
of
course
that
they
do
advertise
nonsponsored
products
but
we
think
as
i
shall
develop
that
this
is
really
immaterial
at
the
critical
thing
is
that
they
did
play
a
very
active
role
in
promoting
the
sale
of
the
sponsored
products
to
their
dealers.
and
finally,
the
commission
said,
perhaps
most
effective
of
all
that
texaco
salesman
continually
carries
the
message
in
his
day
to
day
contacts
with
the
dealers.
in
this
regard
is
important
to
remember
that
these
texaco
salesmen
who
were
most
directly
involved
in
pushing
the
sponsored
tba
products
also
play
a
critical
role
in
the
annual
dealer
evaluations
and
in
determination
of
whether
the
dealer's
list
and
contractual
relations
with
texaco
are
to
be
renewed.
and
the
commission
concluded
that
the
consequence
of
these
promotional
efforts
by
texaco
was
to
impress
upon
texaco
dealers
through
constant
repetition
and
in
a
variety
of
ways
that
texaco
whose
favor
the
dealer
must
court
has
a
strong
interest
in
their
purchase
of
the
sponsored
products.
now,
the
record
in
this
case
indicates
that
although
texaco
did
inform
its
dealers
that
they
are
independent
businessmen
who
had
the
freedom
to
select
what
other
brand
of
tba
they
wanted.
in
fact,
its
performance
to
this
contract,
its
recommendation,
its
promotion,
its
sponsorship
of
the
goodrich
and
firestone
products
did
put
competing
distributors
of
tba
at
a
very
definite
disadvantage
in
selling
to
texaco
outlets.
the
commission
called
31
witnesses
who
are
representatives
of
competing
wholesale
sellers
of
tba.
these
witnesses
testified
basically
as
to
the
difficulties
they
had
in
selling
to
texaco
outlets.
they
testified
that
in
some
instances
there
were
outlets
to
whom
they
couldn't
sell
at
all.
they
testified
as
to
other
texaco
outlets,
they
would
sell
them
on
occasional
item
that
they
couldn't
get
them
to
stock
the
products.
they
testified
as
to
numerous
instances
where
they
receive
and
stop
calling
upon
the
texaco
outlets
because
they
just
found
it
was
a
waste
of
time,
they
couldn't
sell
to
them.
and
then
they
testified
into
some
instances
not
too
many
admittedly
but
a
substantial
number
in
which
the
firestone
--
i'm
sorry
which
the
texaco
dealers
explain
that
they
would
unwilling
to
purchase
the
competing
products
because
of
the
fact
they
were
told
they
had
to
carry
a
sponsored
brand.
and
i
think
the
commission
fairly
summarized
this
evidence
when
it
said
page
91
of
volume
6
of
this
little
document
that
we
have
here
which
contains
most
of
the
things
is
that
--
that
as
a
result,
many
texaco
dealers
as
result
of
texaco
vigorous
sales
campaign
to
its
dealers,
many
texaco
dealers
were
left
with
the
impression
that
texaco
would
look
with
disfavor
upon
their
purchase
of
nonsponsored
tba
products
and
that
they
were
acquired
to
purchase
the
sponsored
tba.
now,
the
practical
effectiveness
program
i
think
is
well
brought
out
in
the
testimony
of
a
man
named
richard
tidwell
which
is
set
forth
in
volume
2
of
the
record.
mr.
tidwell
was
an
airline
pilot
who
went
into
the
service
station
business.
he
was
a
lease
dealer
for
two
years
and
then
left
because
he
wanted
to
go
back
into
flying.
and
he
testified
that
when
he
was
interviewed
they
explained
to
him
the
advantages
of
tba
recommended
goodrich
or
firestone
and
he
selected
firestone.
at
a
later
point,
he
considered
the
possibility
of
taking
on
a
cheaper
brand
of
tires.
and
at
page
1211
of
the
record
at
the
top
of
the
page
he
explained
what
happened.
he
said,
“i
was
thinking
seriously
about
putting
in
a
line
of
the
second
cheaper
brand
of
tires.”
and
i
explain
this
to
mr.
fitz
for
authentically
he
was
a
texaco
representative
there.
he
told
me
at
that
time
and
i
will
say
this
much
in
his
words
as
possibly
said,
“dick,
we
cannot
tell
you
not
to
handle
these
tires
but
we
attempt
to
be
more
lenient
or
look
with
favor
on
our
dealers
who
are
more
loyal
to
us.”
as
a
consequence,
i
told
them
that
i
would
not
handle
the
tires.
and
then
down
at
the
bottom
of
the
page,
mr.
tidwell
was
asked,
“mr.
tidwell,
why
didn't
you
ever
carry
any
other
brand
of
tba
in
your
station
other
than
firestone?”
the
top
of
page
1212
he
said,
“when
i
found
out
that
the
texas
company
desired
me
to
carry
only
one
line,
i
endeavored
to
work
with
them.”
and
the
same
thought
was
repeated
at
the
top
the
latter
part
of
page
1217
when
mr.
tidwell
was
asked,
“why
he
had
asked
from
mr.
fitz'
advice
about
handling
these
competing
tires?”
he
said,
“i
asked
for
two
reasons.
one,
i
had
confidence
in
this
judgment.
the
other
is
if
he
had
any
objections
because
i
wanted
to
stay
on
good
standing
with
the
texaco
company.”
now,
this
is
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
tidwell
--
the
employee
was
a
mr.
fitz
who
had
the
position
of
being
manager
of
the
goodyear
bulk
refinery
i'm
sorry,
goodrich
bulk
refinery
in
the,
i'
sorry
texaco
bulk
refinery
in
the
area
where
he
was
working.
he
was
a
texaco
official
with
whom
he
had
dealt
in
negotiating
his
lease.
now,
indeed,
it's
rather
difficult
to
understand
why
these
two
large
companies
would
pay
$22
million
to
the
texaco
company
if
they
didn't
think
that
in
return
for
this
day
the
were
getting
some
advantage
that
they
could
not
have
gotten
for
their
own
sales
efforts.
this
court
in
atlantic
pointed
this
out
when
it's
stated
that
it
is
difficult
to
escape
the
conclusion
that
there
would
have
been
little
point
in
paying
substantial
commissions
to
oil
companies
were
it
not
for
their
ability
to
exert
power
over
their
wholesalers
and
dealers
and
ability
adequately
demonstrated
on
this
record.
the
court
of
appeals
however
rejected
the
commission's
finding
that
texaco
had
exercised
its
economic
power
basically
on
two
grounds.
first,
the
court
said
page
112
of
this
little
sixth
volume
of
the
appendix,
the
court
of
appeals
said,
“a
finding
of
coercion
is
the
threshold
requirement
of
a
determination
of
exercise
of
dominant
economic
power.”
it
read
this
court's
in
atlantic
decision
as
so
holding
and
since
it's
set
aside
the
commission's
finding
that
there
have
been
done
--
that
there
have
been
coercion
it
concluded
as
the
first
ground
that
the
finding
of
exercise
economic
power
could
not
stand.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
would
think
that
the
commission
feature
plays
a
critical
role
in
this.
i
don't
know
what
the
commission
--
the
trade
commission
would
do
on
this
but
it
seems
to
me
it's
a
very
different
case
where
the
oil
company
makes
an
independent
judgment
and
says
to
its
dealers,
we
recommend
one
product
rather
than
another
or
where
this
being
paid
to
do
this.
i
think
the
--
mr.
justice,
the
impact
upon
competition
presumably
would
be
the
same
but
you
don't
have
this
other
element
and
i
want
to
say
that
the
commission
of
course
has
not
undertaken
to
decide
this
question.
now,
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
might
be
mr.
justice
but
i
just
don't
know
what
the
commission
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
significance
of
paying
of
this
loss,
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
that
the
--
well,
there
are
two
things
about
it.
first,
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
and
i
will
put
it
the
other
way
if
i
may
that
the
fact
--
that
the
suppliers
were
willing
to
pay
the
substantial
amount.
it
seems
to
us
it's
a
pretty
clear
indication
that
the
suppliers
felt
that
in
the
performance
of
these
agreements
texaco
is
giving
something
that
they
could
not
obtain
themselves
through
its
economic
power.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
oh!
of
course.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
no.
of
course
they
did.
they
did
all
the
things
--
i'm
sorry,
they
did
all
the
things
i've
indicated
in
performing
the
contract
which
apparently
was
satisfactory
to
both
goodrich
and
firestone.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
think
that
the
basic
rational
of
atlantic,
be
the
facts
in
this
case
are
different
we
think.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
mr.
justice
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
these
are
different
cases,
i
tried
and
i
think
i
successfully
urged
upon
the
court
in
atlantic
at
least
it
was
my
submission
that
the
atlantic
case
involved
only
the
facts
of
atlantic.
it
didn't
have
to
go
beyond
the
facts
of
atlantic.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
involved
coercion,
yes.
but
we
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
think
mr.
justice
the
opinion
in
atlantic
said
that
without
regard
to
coercion
neither
the
coercion
was
not
the
essential
element
of
the
violation,
coercion
was
merely
a
symptom,
a
form
in
which
the
oil
company
exercise
its
power.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
i
don't
--
i'm
not
suggesting
that
atlantic
holds,
that
atlantic
covers
this
case
in
the
sense
that
the
decision
in
atlantic
controls
this
case.
what
i
do
suggest
is
the
basic
reasoning
and
rational
of
atlantic
covers
this
case.
i'd
like
to
also
add
mr.
justice
that
in
firestone
case
the
fifth
circuit
held
that
the
absence
of
coercion
was
not
fatal.
no,
it's
the
fifth
circuit
did
not
read
this
opinion
--
court's
opinion
in
atlantic
as
holding
that
even
without
coercion
nevertheless
the
commission
might
condemn
the
system.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
you
have
to
show
some
exercise
of
the
power.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
the
findings
of
the
commission,
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
we
think
what
they
have
done
here
while
not
as
much
as
obviously
as
they
did
in
atlantic.
nevertheless,
is
enough
to
warrant
the
commission
in
concluding
that
this
had
a
sufficiently
significant
impact
on
competition.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
well
--
they
have
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
if
that
maybe
mr.
justice
if
that
were
all
the
record
show,
do
we
think
the
record
here
shows
it
could
been
more
had
we
think
they
did
fully
perform
their
obligation
under
the
sales-commission
contract
to
promote
the
sale
of
tba
and
there
as
i
say
they
performed
the
obligations
insufficiently
satisfactory
manner
to
the
oil
companies
that
they're
willing
to
pay
substantial
amount.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
the
promotional
activities
would
be
and
that's
basically
what
the
commission
held
here.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
that's
right,
the
promotional
activities
plus
of
course
the
effect
on
competition.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
right.
they
promoted
the
contract
in
the
context
of
their
economic
relationship
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
right.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it's
the
dominant
economic
power,
the
power
that
texaco
have.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i'm
sorry.
i
don't
understand
your
question.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
when
you
exercise
the
dominant
power
over
the
dealers
and
the
result
of
which
is
--
the
result
of
which
is
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
if
they
don't
feel
free
--
they
don't
have
a
free
choice
when
they
come
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
depending,
it
may
depend
on
how
you
use
the
term.
it's
not
overt
coercion,
it's
not
coercion
in
the
sense
that
the
court
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
it's
not
so
much
something
like
don't
want
to
do.
i
think
there
is
and
i
think
the
reason
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
he
has
it
--
doesn't
have
the
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it's
coercion
in
that
sense
but
coercion
has
been
used
in
this
case
i
think
primarily
to
refer
to
so-called
overt
coercion
and
that
is
if
you
might
use
the
word,
the
real
clubbing
as
distinguished
from
the
gentler
touch.
the
--
now,
there's
another
aspect
of
the
commission's
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
decision
which
is
the
court
of
appeals
seem
to
think
and
we
of
course
disagree
that
this
court
in
its
atlantic
decision
defined
the
precise
limits
of
the
commission's
power
to
condemn
a
sales-commission
plan.
and
then
they
review
all
of
the
acts
that
texaco
had
done,
line
them
up
against
the
acts
at
atlantic
had
done
say
this
was
significantly
different
and
therefore
concluded
that
the
commission
could
not
treat
this
an
exercise
of
the
economic
power
of
texaco.
again,
we
think
that's
not
what
atlantic
held.
atlantic
merely
decided
on
the
facts
before
it
that
the
commission
was
justified
and
we
think
the
court
of
appeals
here
has
approached
the
review
of
the
commission's
order
in
the
wrong
way.
it
seems
to
us
what
the
court
of
appeals
should've
done
has
not
looked
and
saying,
is
this
case
on
all
force
with
atlantic?
it
should've
said
is
despite
the
differences
between
this
case
and
atlantic
was
the
commission
justified
in
concluding
that
nevertheless
this
practice
--
this
sales-commission
system
did
constitute
a
sufficient
exercise
of
power
and
did
have
a
significantly
sufficient
impact
on
competition
to
warrant
condemning
it.
and
this
brings
me
to
the
third
element
of
the
equation
if
you
will.
the
effect
of
this
plan
on
competition,
now,
in
the
atlantic
case,
this
court
recognized
that
the
basic
impact
of
the
sales-commission
plan
upon
competition
was
comparable
to
a
tie-in
arrangement
that
is
in
each
case
the
person
who
was
doing
the
purchasing
felt
constrain
to
exercise,
to
make
his
choice
not
on
a
completely
free
basis
but
upon
some
feeling
that
he
had
to
do,
he
had
to
satisfy
the
oil
company.
and
it
therefore
concluded
that
in
determining
the
impact
on
competition,
it
was
appropriate
to
apply
in
this
area
the
standards
that
had
been
developed
in
the
tie-in
cases,
that
is
it
was
enough
to
show
that
a
not
insubstantial
amount
of
commerce
was
affected
and
it
was
unnecessary
for
the
commission
to
make
a
lengthy
and
protracted
analysis
of
the
market.
in
the
atlantic
case,
the
total
amount
of
sponsored
tba
that
was
sold
over
a
five-year
period
under
the
sales-commission
agreements
between
atlantic
and
goodyear
and
firestone
was
slightly
over
$50
million
over
five-year
period.
in
this
case,
in
one
year,
the
last
year
1956
the
total
sales
were
approximately
$58
million
and
over
the
five-year
period
the
total
sales
involved
in
this
case
were
almost
five
times
at
atlantic.
that
is
$245
million
as
against
$50
million
in
atlantic.
and
of
course
when
a
not
in
substantial
volume
of
commerce
is
tied
up
this
way,
the
effect
on
competition
is
enough
even
though
not
all
the
dealers
were
tied
up,
even
though
many
of
the
dealers
handle
competing
products
and
even
though
many
of
them
didn't
handle
sponsored
product
at
all.
the
critical
thing
we
think
from
this
record
is
that
the
effect
of
the
texaco
sales-commission
plan
has
been
effectively
defense
off
from
a
substantial
segment
of
the
tba
market
represented
by
texaco
dealers
competing
sellers
of
tba.
now,
there
are
two
other
factors
involved
in
considering
the
impact
on
competition
that
i
think
it's
appropriate
to
mention.
when
the
commission
decided
this
case
on
remand,
it
already
had
decided
the
two
other
tba
cases.
and
in
the
course
of
studying
these
three
cases
it
had
learned
a
great
deal
about
the
tba
industry
and
one
of
the
things
that
had
been
disclosed
in
the
course
of
these
three
cases
whether
it's
only
the
very
large
tire
companies
that
are
able
to
have
these
sales-commission
plans.
it
also
it's
clear
that
the
service
stations
by
their
nature
of
becoming
increasingly
important
outlets
for
the
distribution
of
tba.
and
thus,
it
becomes
more
and
more
important
to
the
competing
manufactures
of
tba,
the
smaller
manufacturers
who
were
not
able
to
enjoy
these
sales-commission
plans
that
we
eliminate
the
restraints
on
access
to
the
market
that
these
plans
represent.
in
the
atlantic
case,
this
court
referred
to
the
destructive
effect
on
commerce
that
would
result
from
the
widespread
use
of
these
contracts
by
major
oil
companies
in
supplies.
and
this
is
not
wholly
theoretical
because
we
do
have
in
this
case
the
evidence
that
a
small
battery
manufacture
in
texas
had
great
difficulty
in
selling
to
the
texaco
outlets.
in
addition,
there's
a
further
anomaly
in
this
situation
if
this
sales-commission
plan
is
permitted
to
go
forward
what
would
amounts
to
is
that
even
though
texaco
is
two
or
three
times
larger
than
atlantic,
texaco
is
permitted
to
engage
in
the
basic
kind
of
arrangement
that
is
prohibited
to
atlantic
and
some
of
the
other
companies.
and
finally,
i
think
it's
important
to
stress
the
basic
prophylactic
role
that
congress
intended
section
5
of
the
trade
commission
act
promote.
i
refer
to
justice
brandeis'
notable
dissent
in
the
gratz
case
which
this
court
only
two
or
three
years
ago
recognized
is
now
the
proper
approach.
that
is
under
section
5,
it's
not
necessary
to
await
until
the
point
that
a
restraint
of
trade
turns
into
a
full
blown
violation
of
the
sherman
act
or
the
clayton
act.
the
commission
can
step
in
and
even
at
a
preliminary
stage
because
of
the
dangerous
tendencies
which
it
practice
has
and
we
think
that
this
practice
--
this
practice,
there's
a
demonstrated
anticompetitive
effect
but
in
any
event,
the
possible
potential
dangers
of
these
plans
continue
as
this
court
recognized
in
atlantic
for
both
(inaudible)
for
both
the
competing
smaller
manufacturers
of
tba
and
the
wholesale
distributors
of
those
commodities.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
of
course
it
seems
--
i'd
like
to
answer
with
something
mr.
barton
said,
the
basic
question
here
isn't
whether
there's
been
misuse
of
economic
power.
this
--
no
one
has
being
punished
here.
the
commission
is
performing
the
prophylactic
function
of
freeing
our
economy
from
an
improper
restraints
and
the
question
is
whether
the
use
of
this
power
whether
the
use
of
this
power
together
with
what
a
fencing
law
from
part
of
the
competitive
area
whether
that's
enough
to
justify
the
commission
in
concluding
that
it's
an
unfair
method
of
competition.
now,
there's
been
a
lot
of
talk
about
some
of
the
evidence
in
this
case
and
i
just
like
to
go
back
to
a
couple
of
these
items
that
my
opponents
have
referred
to.
for
example,
this
man
mr.
tidwell
whom
they
say
felt
perfectly
free
to
carry
these
products
nonetheless.
at
page
1211,
after
the
passage
i
previously
referred
to,
he
was
asked,
“did
you
take
on
a
cheaper
line
of
tires?”
and
his
answer
was,
“not
in
stock
but
i
did
sell
some.”
and
then
three
or
four
lines
thereafter,
he
was
asked,
“did
you
ever
display
those
tires
in
your
station?”
he
says,
“no,
i
never
displayed
any
other
product
than
firestone.”
what
it
seem
to
us
is
very
clear
from
this.
what
he
was
saying
was
because
he
wanted
to
remain
in
the
good
graces
of
texaco.
he
would
not
take
these
products,
these
competing
products
on
as
a
display
product
that
will
be
generally
available
for
the
public
to
see.
sure,
he
would
occasionally
buy
some
of
these
products
and
that's
fully
consistent
with
the
testimony
of
these
wholesalers
that
yes,
they
could
sell,
they
could
sell
on
occasional
item
to
texaco
dealer,
to
many
texaco
dealers.
they
could
sell
a
few
things
that
the
people
wanted
to
stock
up
on
but
basically
there
were
substantial
testimony
in
this
record
that
these
people
did
not
have
the
same
opportunities
when
they
tried
to
penetrate
the
texaco
market
as
when
they
tried
to
penetrate
some
other
markets.
now,
what
are
these
dealers
do?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes
and
then
we
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
--we
think
so
mr.
justice
consistent
with
the
long
line
of
cases
in
this
court
which
have
reviewed
commission
decisions
under
section
5
is
to
what
the
commission'
authority.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
they
have
to
have
some
basis
for
their
expertise
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
don't
know
mr.
justice
because
they
have
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
but
i
think
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
it's
a
factual
matter
only
in
the
sense
that
you've
got
to
see
what
the
commission
had
but
it
seems
to
me
the
answer
we
think
is
that
in
this
kind
--
this
is
the
area
where
the
commission
has
very
great
discretion
as
to
evaluating
the
impact
of
this
practice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
i
don't
think
they
could
say
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
i
think
there
has
to
be
some
of
it.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
there
have
to
be
some
proof
as
to
what
the
impact
upon
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
if
it
challenge
that
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
but
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
say
there's
no
factual
basis
for
this.
the
court
of
appeals
said,
as
we
read
their
opinion
that
the
kind
of
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
they
--
no,
mr.
justice.
we
don't
think
they
said.
they
would
they
said
was
as
they
interpret
this
court's
atlantic
decision.
atlantic
required
the
commission
to
come
up
with
a
certain
type
of
evidence
with
the
certain
quantum
of
evidence
and
then
they
said,
"we
don't
think
that
what
the
commission
had
before
in
this
case
was
enough."
they
did
not
attempt
to
say,
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
attempt
to
say,
we
don't
think
there's
any
evidence
here
to
show
either
that
texaco
in
performing
this
contract
was
engaging
in
these
promotional
activities
or
that
there
was
not
any
competitive
effect.
they
said,
looking
on
what
the
commission
were
acted
on,
looking
on
what
the
commission
found
happened
here,
what
texaco
did,
we
don't
think
this
is
enough
as
a
matter
of
law
basically
to
constitute
an
unfair
method
of
competition.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
it
was
30%
--
let
me
explain
it.
it
was
30%
of
all
the
dealers
who
were
service
station
dealers
but
the
commission
explained
that
that
figure
was
distorted
because
of
significant
number
of
those
dealers
with
so-called
contract
dealers
who
would
not
handle
tba
for
example,
the
grocery
store
but
had
a
couple
of
gasoline
pump.
so,
the
commission
indicated
the
figure
was
higher
than
that.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
the
type
of
plan
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
don't
--
i
think
the
difference
maybe
mr.
justice
these
plans
are
not
always
completely
effective.
this
was
true
in
atlantic
too.
and
atlantic
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
suppose
to
some
extent
it
may
depend
on
the
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
take
it
again
it
may
depend
on
what
the
reaction
of
the
individual
dealer
is
to
the
situation.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
would
--
i
have
to
say
mr.
justice
in
all
candid
that
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
i'd
say
in
all
candid
mr.
justice
that
the
record
does
indicate
that
where
a
particular
customer
wanted
a
particular
single
tire,
one
customer
generally
speaking
most
of
the
dealers
would
go
out
and
stock
and
buy
this
particular
type
of
tire
even
though
they
didn't
stock
them.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
then
maybe
if
the
other
thing
i
suppose
mr.
justice
is
of
course
goodrich
and
firestone
are
popular
products.
ome
of
the
dealers
may
have
been
well
satisfied
to
take
this.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
no
i
don't
mr.
justice
because
it
seems
to
us
what
we
have
here
is
one,
the
relationship
and
we
can
see
they
did
tell
many
dealers
that
they
were
free
to
buy
what
they
wanted
but
apparently
the
record
strongly
indicates
that
despite
the
statement
many
of
the
dealers
did
not
feel
they
had
a
complete
freedom.
the
--
these
31
wholesalers
that
mr.
handler
tends
to
distinguish
some
of
the
incidents
but
some
of
them
can
be
distinguished.
there
were
explanations
but
there
are
a
lot
of
them.
there
are
a
lot
of
them
that
just
cannot
be
distinguished.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
the
record
does
not
show
whether
they
had
any
knowledge
of
that.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
the
record
does
not
show
that.
the
record
does
not
show
that
mr.
justice.
i'd
just
like
to
read
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
that
would
make
our
case
even
stronger
i
think
if
in
fact
the
dealers
knew
that
texaco
was
in
fact
getting
a
substantial
amount
on
the
sales.
i
just
--
the
record
does
not
show
that
mr.
justice.
i
just
like
to
read
to
the
court
that
pages
552
to
553
of
the
record
where
the
example
of
this
wholesaler
testimony.
one
of
the
witnesses
was
being
asked
why
he
had
stopped
calling
on
the
texaco
dealers
and
he
said
at
the
bottom
of
the
page,
when
you
make
a
hundred
calls
and
they
show
no
signs
of
business
and
then
maybe
continue
to
make
calls
another
hundred
and
still
are
told
from
time
to
time
that
they
can't
buy
your
tires
that
they
have
to
buy
goodrich,
i
think
it
is
time
to
give
up
on
it.
and
he
was
questioned,
by
whom
are
you
giving
such
information
as
you
just
related
answered
by
the
texaco
stations
that
we
called
on
it.
it
seems
to
us
that
this
record
fully
supports
the
commission's
conclusion
that
a
very
large
number
of
texaco
dealers
felt
constraint
not
to
buy
competing
tba
products.
and
i
think
the
record
fully
supports
the
commission
and
it
seems
to
us
that
the
court
of
appeals
the
appropriate
for
court
of
appeals
should've
put
the
inquiry
whether
the
commission
was
justified
in
the
light
of
these
facts
shown
by
the
record
in
concluding
that
this
particular
practice
had
a
sufficiently
pernicious
effect
actual
and
potential
on
competition
to
warrant
condemning
it
not
to
try
to
line
this
thing
up
and
saying
they
have
done
everything
here
that
they
did
in
atlantic
and
the
court
of
appeals
said,
"no,
they
haven't
and
that's
the
end
of
this.
this
is
not
just
a
fact
cases,
it
entails
basically
the
question
of
what
the
scope
of
review
of
commission
determinations
is
an
unfair
methods
in
competition
and
the
commission's
discretion
to
define
those
terms.
and
so
it
seems
to
us
that
in
this
case
the
commission
was
fully
warranted
in
concluding
that
this
situation
no
less
than
atlantic
was
an
unfair
method
of
competition
and
that
the
same
kind
of
order
should
be
entered.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
think
mr.
justice
the
commission
could
sell
conclude.
i
do
want
to
make
it
very
explicit.
the
commission
has
not
passed
upon
that
issue.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
think
the
commission
could
so
conclude,
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
does.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
don't
know
mr.
justice.
i
think
as
they
approach
and
begin
to
require
a
greater
and
greater
line
you
got
into
problems
with
it.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
fortunately,
the
commission
has
not
yet
had
to
face
up
to
this
problem.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
thank
you.
