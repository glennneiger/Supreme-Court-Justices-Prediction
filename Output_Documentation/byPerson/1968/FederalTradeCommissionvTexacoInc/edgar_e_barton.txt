mr.
edgar
e.
barton
mr.
chief
justice
and
if
your
honors
please.
i
represent
b.f.
goodrich
company
who
has
sales
arrangements
with
texaco
as
well
as
with
five
other
oil
companies.
now,
all
of
these
arrangements
which
were
had
were
not
only
with
texaco
but
with
also
the
other
part
of
oil
companies
would
be
prohibited
under
this
order
which
has
been
entered
by
the
commission.
this
is
despite
the
fact
that
the
agreements
which
were
made
by
b.f.
goodrich
with
these
oil
companies
were
made
because
this
was
the
way
that
b.f.
goodrich
thought
that
these
products
could
be
distributed
the
best.
in
other
words,
the
problem
as
mr.
hoven
who
was
the
witness
on
the
stand
here
described
it
was
this,
that
there
are
and
great
number
of
dealers
in
the
country
who
have
to
be
contacted.
the
method
of
distribution
of
this
product
is
through
supply
point
established
by
the
tire
company.
but,
once
the
franchise
is
established
by
the
tire
company,
there's
a
continuing
relationship
that
exists
in
the
way
of
getting
promotional
materials
out
to
the
dealers.
in
a
numerous
mechanical
means
of
this
kind
and
mr.
hoven
said,
it's
a
lot
cheaper
for
us
to
hire
texaco
who
contact
in
those
people
day
after
day
to
get
those
materials
out
than
for
us
who
have
a
limited
numbers
of
salesmen
to
get
the
materials
out.
he
said,
that's
what
we're
paying
the
commission
for.
now,
i
would
call
your
honors
attention
--
mr.
edgar
e.
barton
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edgar
e.
barton
no,
your
honor.
mr.
edgar
e.
barton
no
your
honor
they're
not.
now,
--
mr.
edgar
e.
barton
they're
not
exclusive
your
honor
as
a
matter
of
fact
texaco
has
similar
arrangements
at
the
time
this
case
was
tried
12
years
ago
although
with
the
contrary
and
i
think
i'm
the
only
one
here
within
the
case
and
this
tried.
but
they
are
at
that
time
arrangements
with
firestone
and
with
us
and
knew
most
the
oil
companies
had
their
arrangements
with
the
number
of
tire
companies.
there's
nothing
exclusive
about
this.
mr.
edgar
e.
barton
no,
your
honor
it's
not
a
broken
up
on
any
regional
basis.
the
matter
--
in
this
case
there's
no
similar
situation
that
existed
in
the
atlantic
goodyear
situation
on
the
break
up
geographically.
now,
although
counseled
avoiced
to
state
in
so
many
words
clear
the
basis
of
the
commission's
order
can
only
be
that
there's
a
per
se
rule
to
strike
down
all
tba
sales-commission
arrangements
between
all
oil
companies
and
all
tire
companies.
on
the
record
here,
i
submit
your
honor
that
the
commission
wants
to
say
that
merely
because
you
have
a
larger
oil
company
and
a
large
tire
company
and
that
there
has
been
quite
a
bit
of
money
paid
that
that
constitutes
illegality.
now,
i
submit
to
your
honors
that
record
is
2500
pages
long.
we
argue
this
case
before
the
court
of
appeals
and
that
the
court
of
appeals
took
a
year
of
full
year
before
the
case
was
decided
by
the
court
of
appeals.
i
submit
your
honor
that
that
record
was
gone
over
thoroughly
by
the
court
of
appeals
when
it
decided
this
case
the
whole
2500
pages
of
it.
and
they
searched
to
see
whether
there
was
any
evidence
in
that
record
to
support
the
proposition
that
there
had
been
a
misuse
of
the
power
that
the
texaco
company
had
in
connection
with
these
contracts.
it
could
not
find,
it
did
not
find
any
misuse
of
that
power.
now,
for
--
mr.
edgar
e.
barton
yes,
your
honor
it
has.
mr.
edgar
e.
barton
no,
your
honor,
the
first
--
the
second
panel
judge
bazelon
was
sitting
as
a
chief
judge.
he
was
not
in
the
first
panel
and
on
the
argument
on
the
second
time
the
decision
was
unanimous
by
the
court
of
appeals.
judge
bazelon
and
the
other
two
judges
held
with
this.
so,
that
there
were
--
in
a
total
of
sixth
court
of
appeals
judges
some
of
this
case.
and
five,
--
and
the
court
of
appeals
has
both
times,
the
first
time
by
two
the
one
and
the
second
time
three
had
not
been
held.
there
was
no
evidence
of
misuse
of
economic
power
by
texaco.
now,
and
in
that
--
mr.
edgar
e.
barton
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edgar
e.
barton
i
think
the
most
of
them
are
owned
by
people
not
connected
by
third
parties
and
by
the
owners
themselves,
60%
of
them
as
mr.
friedman
said.
mr.
edgar
e.
barton
40%
are
owned
by
texaco
or
at
leased
by
texaco
and
leased
them
to
the
dealer.
mr.
edgar
e.
barton
yes,
they
do
your
honor.
mr.
edgar
e.
barton
that's
right
your
honor.
mr.
edgar
e.
barton
that's
true
your
honor
but
he
also
--
mr.
edgar
e.
barton
your
honor
i
--
my
answer
--
mr.
edgar
e.
barton
your
honor
my
answer
to
you
is
this,
that
an
experienced
examiner
sat
on
the
trial
of
this
case.
he
heard
the
witnesses,
all
the
witnesses
testified.
he
was
also
the
examiner
in
the
other
cases
that
were
here.
at
the
end
of
that
case,
he
held
in
his
first
initial
decision
that
there
was
nothing
wrong
done
by
the
people
in
this
case.
mr.
edgar
e.
barton
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edgar
e.
barton
your
honor,
may
i
--
mr.
edgar
e.
barton
if
it
was
proved
that
the
texaco
salesman
went
to
the
station
and
said,
i
want
you
--
i
want
you
--
mr.
edgar
e.
barton
that
would
be
a
different
case
in
we
have
here.
mr.
edgar
e.
barton
i
submit
to
your
honor
that
one
dealer
--
mr.
edgar
e.
barton
it
is
in
the
record
but
your
honor
we
have
to
realize
this,
that
there
were
38,000
texaco
dealers.
mr.
edgar
e.
barton
i
don't
know
that
it
is
because
as
mr.
handler
pointed
out
there
was
a
questionnaire
went
out
to
these
dealers
and
the
commission
got
back
that
questionnaire
and
then
didn't
call
one
dealer
to
stand
and
testify
after
they
seen
that
questionnaire
and
they
wouldn't
show
us
the
questionnaire
which
they
sent
out
when
we
applied
for
it.
mr.
edgar
e.
barton
because
this
dealer
was
an
ex-dealer.
mr.
edgar
e.
barton
that's
right.
mr.
edgar
e.
barton
that
is
true
your
honor
but
i
submit
to
your
honor
that
in
this
case
where
there
has
been
a
thorough
review
of
the
record
by
the
court
of
appeals
twice
and
they
found
that
there
was
no
proof
of
the
commission's
charge
that
we
have
disprove
the
negative.
now,
i
submit
your
honor
it's
difficult
to
disprove
a
negative
but
here
that
has
been
done.
i
submit
that
on
all
of
the
bases,
this
case
should
after
12
long
years
be
dismissed
by
this
court.
mr.
edgar
e.
barton
it's
difficult
to
answer
question
in
--
actually
in
--
mr.
edgar
e.
barton
the
basic
responsibility
is
the
commission
if
you
want
a
real
answer
because
what
they
did
when
sent
this
case
back
to
the
examiner
and
sent
the
other
two
cases
out
to
the
courts
they
created
the
delay
that
it's
existed
here.
mr.
edgar
e.
barton
the
companies
have
responded
when
they
were
attacked
your
honor.
mr.
edgar
e.
barton
but
when
you
say
why
there
has
been
a
delay,
i
think
i
have
to
tell
the
truthfully
it's
because
the
commission
sent
this
case
back
or
read
to
the
examiner
and
held
it
up
by
that
time.
i
submit
to
your
honors
that
on
the
basis
of
the
facts
in
this
record
as
distinguished
from
the
facts
of
other
records
that
this
case
should
be
finally
dismissed.
thank
you.
mr.
edgar
e.
barton
mr.

and
if

i

honor.
mr.
edgar
e.
barton
but
when
you
say
why
there
has
been
a
delay,
i
think
i
have
to
tell
the
truthfully
it's
because
the
commission
sent
this
case
back
or
read
to
the
examiner
and
held
it
up
by
that
time.
i
submit
to
your
honors
that
on
the
basis
of
the
facts
in
this
record
as
distinguished
from
the
facts
of
other
records
that
this
case
should
be
finally
dismissed.
thank
you.
