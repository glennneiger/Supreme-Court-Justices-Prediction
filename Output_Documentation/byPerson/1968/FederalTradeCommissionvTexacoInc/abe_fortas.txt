justice
abe
fortas
mr.
friedman,
may
i
ask
you
at
this
point,
is
there
evidence
in
the
record
as
to
whether
any
of
these
stations
and
of
tba
of
other
manufactures?
justice
abe
fortas
and
as
the
evidence
is
to
how
substantial
that
was?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
friedman,
would
you
agree
however
that
that
shows
something
more
than
the
existence
--
mere
existence
of
economic
power?
justice
abe
fortas
you
have
to
show
the
use
of
economic
power
to
favor
firestone
and
goodyear
--
justice
abe
fortas
in
this
case.
justice
abe
fortas
and
you
believe
that
that
is
evident
in
the
findings
below?
justice
abe
fortas
findings
of
the
commission.
justice
abe
fortas
because
certainly
if
you
showed
nothing
more
than
the
lease
arrangement
between
texaco
and
the
stations
the
mere
fact
that
texaco
receives
a
commission
from
the
tire
companies
would
not
be
enough,
would
it?
justice
abe
fortas
but
that's
all
the
record
show?
justice
abe
fortas
do
you
think
that
promotional
activity
with
the
stations
standing
alone
would
be
enough
to
constitute
the
necessary
use
of
down
in
economic
power?
justice
abe
fortas
professor
handler,
i
asked
mr.
friedman
some
questions
about
the
record
with
respect
to
evidence
as
to
handling
by
the
service
stations
of
the
products
of
others.
justice
abe
fortas
professor
handler,
would
you
tell
us
precisely
what
the
contract
between
texaco
on
the
one
hand
and
goodyear
and
firestone
provides
with
respect
to
the
promotional
services
to
be
performed
by
texaco?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
let's
retrace
that
a
minute.
do
i
gather
from
what
you
say
that
the
same
persons
who
sell
texaco
gas
in
effect
to
the
stations
also
act
as
salesman
for
the
products
of
goodyear
and
firestone?
justice
abe
fortas
alright.
they
sell
to
the
stations.
they
sell
goodyear
and
firestone
products
to
the
stations.
second,
they
instruct
the
service
station
operator
with
respect
to
the
problems
involved
in
the
choice
of
tba
and
customer
service
and
that
sort
of
thing,
is
that
what
you're
telling
us?
justice
abe
fortas
and
but
with
respect
to
take
another
subject
with
respect
to
the
use
of
the
texaco
credit
card
that
is
available
even
if
it's
not
a
goodyear
or
firestone
product,
isn't
that?
justice
abe
fortas
but
and
the
--
how
about
the
distribution
of
promotional
materials
such
as
signs
to
be
erected
in
the
service
station?
justice
abe
fortas
does
the
texaco
representative
distribute
to
the
service
stations
promotional
materials
such
as
signs
of
the
--
of
goodyear
and
firestone?
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
what
this
comes
down
to
briefly
and
roughly
is
that
texaco
you
said,
does
these
texaco
representatives
do
not
actually
sell
in
the
sense
of
taking
orders,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
what
you're
telling
us
is
that
the
texaco
representatives
do
in
fact
promote
the
sale
in
the
sense
of
suggesting
that
the
dealer
buy
products
of
these
two
companies
as
he
--
that
the
texaco
representative
instructs
the
service
station
operator
in
the
problems
attendant
upon
the
use,
the
inventory
etcetera
and
sale
techniques
of
tba.
justice
abe
fortas
and
i
suppose
to
put
this
in
the
narrowest
possible
focus
as
your
presenting
in
the
case
to
us,
the
question
is
whether
those
activities
which
you
say
cost
texaco
70%
of
its
total
commissions
that
it
receives.
whether
those
activities
coupled
with
its
possession
of
dominant
economic
power
over
its
stations
constitute
say
violation
of
section
5
or
rather
that
the
commission
could
conclude,
could
properly
conclude
that
they
constituted
violation
section
5,
is
that
about
it
as
you
see
it?
justice
abe
fortas
are
these
arrangements
exclusive
that
is
to
say
they're
not
exclusive.
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
broken
up
on
regional
basis?
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
texaco
had
it
some
own
line
of
tires,
in
your
judgment
could
the
commission
find
that
it
was
an
unfair
method
of
competition
or
for
texaco
to
make
recommendations
to
its
service
stations
that
they
buy
the
texaco
tire?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
know
that
but
do
you
think
that
texaco
therefore
could
not
even
if
you
don't
have
a
tie-in
sale,
in
fact
just
as
they
are
now
except
that
it's
texaco
product,
do
you
think
that
would
still
an
unfair
method
of
competition?
justice
abe
fortas
why
can't
it
so
conclude
with
respect
to
motor
oil.
texaco
sells
gasoline
and
motor
oil
i
suppose,
doesn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
and
i
suppose
that
its
dealers
are
at
least
encouraged
to
buy
and
stock
texaco
motor
oil.
i
mean
so
what
you're
saying
really
is
that
three
major
products
if
texaco
is
in
the
business
of
selling
three
major
products
that
to
something
drastic
is
warranted
just
because
the
third
product
is
added
to
the
fundamental
lines.
justice
abe
fortas
you
sure
get
into
a
problem
alright
but
i
think
the
answer
is
kind
of
difficult.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
friedman,
may
i
ask

would
you
agree
however
that
that
shows

more

you

to
favor
firestone
and
goodyear
--
justice
abe
fortas
in
this
case.
justice
abe

and
you
believe
that
that
is
evident
in
the
findings
below?
justice
abe
fortas
findings
of
the
commission.
justice
abe
fortas
because
certainly
if
you
showed
nothing
more
than
the
lease
arrangement
between
texaco
and
the
stations
the
mere
fact
that
texaco
receives
a

would
it?
