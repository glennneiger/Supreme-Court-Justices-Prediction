black
who
was
that
employee?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
how?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
haven't
heard
it
yet
but
the
texaco
company
station,
who
owns
them?
justice
hugo
l.
black
who
owns
the
other
40%?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
they
have
texaco
signs,
they
sell
texaco
oil?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
they
--
the
agent
there
of
course
is
dependent
on
getting
texaco
oil.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
what
he
has
to
get
to
make
his
living?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
then
how
do
you
discount
the
statement
that
was
read
from
us
by
the
texaco
agent
of
their
big
company
has
all
the
power,
how
do
you
discount
that
thing
when
you
said,
we
prefer
for
you
to
get
texaco?
justice
hugo
l.
black
prefer
you
to
do
deal
with
this.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
then
let
me
ask
you
in
your
view?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
asking
of
an
experienced
examiner.
here's
a
company
that
has
a
life
and
death
of
this
texaco
dealer
on
its
hand,
they
came
there
without
giving
texaco
on.
a
representative
of
the
company
comes
to
him
and
tells
him,
“i
want
you
to
buy
and
sell
these
things.”
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
do
you
say
about
it
as
a
person
with
a
knowledge
of
what
amounts
to
something
to
fight
for
everyday
life?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
did
you
hear
that
stipulation?
justice
hugo
l.
black
tbut
did
you
get
a
statement
read
mr.
friedman,
is
that
in
the
record?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
is
that
--
is
that
in
the
record?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
it's
hard
of
course
to
get
them
to
testify
against
the
dominant
company?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
did
they
get
this
dealer?
justice
hugo
l.
black
oh!
he
was
an
ex-dealer.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that's
easiest
way
to
get
him
to
testify
against
the
texaco,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
noticed
that
the
court
said
something
about
the
long
years,
who's
responsible
for
the
delay?
justice
hugo
l.
black
can
that
be
held?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
the
company
has
filed
in
the
order,
the
company
hasn't
--
hadn't
been
wholly
without
any
influence
whatever
in
connection
with
the
delay
has
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
they
were
both
vigorous
as
they
should
with
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
it
not
also
depend
on
the
reaction
of
the
customer
who
comes
in
and
didn't
like
their
kind
of
tires
and
he
asked
him
to
get
him
some
somewhere
else.
would
that
have
anything
do?
justice
hugo
l.
black
maybe
your
record
doesn't
show
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
what
i
meant.
what
i
meant
by
that
to
say
why
wouldn't
then
show
that
was
what
they
did
and
that
was
why
they
were
doing
it
because
their
customer
want
them
to
do
it.
i
will
buy
some
tires
for
sale.
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
the
record
show
whether
the
texaco
dealers
knew
the
amount
of
profit
that
will
go
to
the
company
if
they
sold
a
particular
brand
that
they
wanted
to?
justice
hugo
l.
black
doesn't
show
that
whether
they
had
any
knowledge
that
they
did
get
anything?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
wouldn't
that
be
irrelevant
piece
of
evidence?
justice
hugo
l.
black
who
was
that
employee?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
how?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
haven't
heard
it
yet

the
