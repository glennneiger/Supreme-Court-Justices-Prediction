justice
potter
stewart
except
in
the
atlantic
case
there
was
coercion
in
here
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
correct.
justice
potter
stewart
and
they're
terminable
by
either
party?
justice
potter
stewart
and
as
i
--
then
the
facts
good
many
of
these
service
station
operators
are
lessees
of
texaco.
justice
potter
stewart
but
a
great
many
are
or
at
least
to
some
are
also
lessees
of
other
people
and
some
own
their
property.
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
don't
--
could
you
think
the
atlantic
decision
--
opinion
covers
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
think
the
position
that
you
presented
here
in
atlantic
covers
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
which
are
really
two
different
cases?
justice
potter
stewart
which
involved
coercion?
justice
potter
stewart
don't
you
think
the
opinion
in
atlantic
--
what
further
and
covers
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
so,
maybe
atlantic
doesn't
hold
something
that
covers
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
unless
mr.
handler,
we
thought
the
commission
had
not
articulated
a
sufficient
basis
for
any
such
decision.
justice
potter
stewart
in
the
sense
that
--
i
suppose
you
say
then
that
texaco
didn't
have
any
kind
of
dominant
power
of
any
kind.
justice
potter
stewart
alright,
let's
assume
that
they
have
dominant
power
and
now
what
is
that
mean?
justice
potter
stewart
what
is
that
mean
to
have
dominant
power?
justice
potter
stewart
and
did
the
--
but
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
texaco
had
not
attempted
to
exercise
that
power?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
apparently
though
there
were
some
promotion
by
texaco?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
in
your
book
and
apparently
in
the
court
of
appeals'
book
is
not
exercise
of
dominant
power?
justice
potter
stewart
and
a
man
with
dominant
power
can
recommend
tba
without
exercising
its
dominant
power?
justice
potter
stewart
and
otherwise
you
lose
a
case?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
what
should
i've
understood
mr.
friedman
to
say
when
he
said,
“well,
we
may
not
have
a
club
here
but
we
have
the
gentler
touch.”
justice
potter
stewart
apparently
then
do
you
think
that
the
commission
finding
--
commission's
finding
that
just
to
the
contrary,
just
as
unsupportable
and
there
has
to
be
set
aside?
justice
potter
stewart
what
are
you
searching
for
here?
wasn't
this
held
to
be
an
unfair
method
of
competition?
isn't
that
what
the
commission
found
that
was
under
section
5?
justice
potter
stewart
now
that's
all
--
is
that
all
they
held?
they
didn't
purport
to
say
that
they
needed
anything
else?
justice
potter
stewart
just
a
recommendation
and
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
now,
what
are
the
standards
for
a
none
--
for
the
federal
trade
commission
has
to
follow
in
determining
what's
an
unfair
method
of
competition
or
unfair
practice
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
where
did
--
where
--
what's
the
source
of
your
requirement,
there
must
be
some
restrictive
effect
on
competition?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
mr.
friedman,
i
gather
then
that
you
feel
that
although
the
question
maybe
that
the
--
whether
the
commission
could
say
power
plus
promotion
is
nevertheless
there's
a
really
the
question
is
whether
the
commission
could
rationally
decide
that
promotion
by
one
with
power
really
may
have
some
substantial
consequences?
justice
potter
stewart
and
if
that
were
wholly
irrational
why
i
--
is
that
what
this
case
is
about?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
what
if
there
were
no
evidence
whatsoever
in
the
record
that
as
to
what
consequence
promotion
by
texaco
had,
could
the
commission
just
rear
back
and
say,
well,
look
that
on
our
own
expertise,
we
know
that
when
somebody
with
texaco's
power
says,
this,
it's
going
to
have
this
kind
of
consequence.
justice
potter
stewart
in
the
record?
justice
potter
stewart
in
the
record
if
they
have
to
have
something
there
then
i
suppose
we
have
to
look
at
the
evidence
on
the
other
side
then.
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
it
does
become
a
factual
matter,
doesn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
you
think
they
could
be
--
they
could
just
stand
and
said,
we
don't
need
any
evidence?
justice
potter
stewart
we
don't
need
any
evidence
at
all,
we
just
know
that
when
texaco
says
something
like
they've
been
saying,
please
buy
this
that
it's
going
to
have
this
kind
of
a
consequence.
justice
potter
stewart
so,
there
has
to
be
some
proof?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
what
if
it's
in
challenged
by
the
other
side
which
it
has
been?
justice
potter
stewart
the
other
side
says,
there
is
no
factual
basis
for
that
justice
potter
stewart
well,
they
at
least
said
it
--
it
wasn't
enough
evidence
having
even
to
make
the
rational
choice,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
except
in
the
atlantic
case
there
was
coercion
in
here
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart

justice
