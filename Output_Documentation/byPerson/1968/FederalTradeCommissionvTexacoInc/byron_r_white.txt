you

yes,
but
the

is
what?
justice

white
it's
just
an
inference
from
that
you
draw
in

that
they
did
something?
justice

is
it
something

you

that

that's
all
the

that's
all

do
you
say
that
is
the
exercise

what
kind
of

is
it?

so,
if

you've
done
what?
justice

white
well,
you've
affected
some
consequence
apparently
when
you
exercise

do
they

justice

white
was
that
coercion
or
not?
justice

well
it's
the
use

to
make
somebody
do
that
he
may
something
he
doesn't
want
to,
what's
that?

they
may
not
want

that
must
be

in

then,

just
30%

does
that
make
a
big

how
do
they
explain
now
that
apparently
in
all
of

of
dealers
who
were
promoted
by
texaco
exercise
their
choice
to
buy
from
someone
else?
justice

so
every

understood
he
had
a
