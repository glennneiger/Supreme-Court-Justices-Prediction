justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
suppose
you
would
agree
that
the
answer
to
that
question
might
be
different
depending
upon
the
nature
of
the
geographical
distribution
required
so
that
we
don't
have
a
--
if
that's
so,
we
don't
have
before
us
merely
the
bowl
of
proposition
that
you
have
now
stated
but
may
we
not
also
or
alternatively
have
before
us
that
proposition
in
the
context
of
the
fact
that
here
you
have
such
a
tremendous
disparity
that
is
to
say
that
only
about
6.6%
of
the
illinois
registered
voters
reside
in
53
of
the
counties,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
so,
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
mean
i
assume
that
you're
not
saying
that
we
have
to
base
our
decision
solely
on
the
abstraction
that
you
put
to
us
a
moment
ago.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
mean
to
say,
what
is
here
though
is
the
fact
that
this
question
and
the
specific
context
of
the
demographic
facts
in
the
state
of
illinois,
in
the
distribution
of
people
among
the
counties.
here
you
could
get,
--
let's
say,
you
could
get
the
signatures
of
over
90%
of
the
voters
of
the
state
and
still
not
comply
with
its
statute.
justice
abe
fortas
and
you
might
have
another
state
in
which
a
statute
of
this
sort
might
work
without
that
rather
startling
consequence.
if
you
have
the
population
distributed
more
or
less
equally
among
the
requisite
number
of
counties.
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
your
position.
i
think
you
want
to
go
far
broad.
but
one
has
to
go
far
broad
on
the
straight
numerical
basis.
but
i
assume
you
do
agree
that
there's
at
least
a
theoretical
possibility
of
an
alternative
which
is
tied
to
the
rather
striking
facts
in
the
state
of
illinois
with
respect
to
the
unequal
distribution
of
population.
justice
abe
fortas
why
do
you
say
that
would
debase
the
vote
of
the
others?
justice
abe
fortas
as
i
understand
it,
the
argument
is
that
people
who
live
in
50
other
counties
with
6
point
whatever
it
is,
less
than
7%
of
the
population
can
prevent
the
remaining
people
in
the
state
from
putting
somebody
on
the
ballot.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that
may
be
but
that's
our
argument,
isn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
why
do
you
say
that
if
you
require
that
the
statute
be
based
solely
upon
numbers
that
that
would
--
that
might
result
in
debasing
the
vote
of
people
throughout
most
of
the
state?
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
a
candidate
on
the
democratic
ticket
got
all
of
the
--
got
the
solid
democratic
vote
of
cook
county
and
from
all
other
counties,
solid
democratic
vote,
how
many
counties
would
have
to
go
for
him
in
order
for
him
to
be
elected?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
it
wouldn't
be
many,
would
it?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that's
the
point
for
whatever
it
might
mean
that
is
to
say
that
in
theory
anyway,
a
candidate
can
be
elected
by
a
party
vote,
by
a
vote
of
like-minded
people
and
let
us
say
neither
10
counties
only
but
in
order
for
an
independent
to
get
on
the
ballot
under
this
statute,
he
will
have
to
have
some
people
voting
--
some
people
favoring
him
in
50
other
counties.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
if
he's
an
independent
candidate
who
represents
a
splinter,
a
democratic
splinter
or
a
republican
splinter,
suppose
he
represented
a
democratic
splinter,
it
might
very
well
be
that
his
appeal
would
be
confined
to
a
very
few
counties
even
though
at
the
time
of
the
election,
he
might
have
a
formidable
vote
in
the
average
if
he
could
get
on
the
ballot.
justice
abe
fortas
that's
from
the
pragmatic
point
of
view,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
that
might
be
the
difficulty.
