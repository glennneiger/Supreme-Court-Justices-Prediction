mr.
richard
e.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
second
basic
issue
in
this
matter
is
whether
or
not
the
illinois
requirements
amounts
to
invidious
discrimination
whether
it
constitutes
an
unreasonable
burden,
the
voters
of
the
state
of
illinois.
i
suggest
to
you
that
illinois
has
struck
a
good
balance
between
the
interest
of
the
state
of
illinois
and
the
interest
of
those
people
who
may
be
disadvantaged
by
this
requirement.
there
is
no
precise
or
objective
test
which
may
be
applied
to
the
situation
such
as
this
but
there
are
a
number
of
elements,
a
number
of
concepts
which
may
be
applied
to
this
particular
type
of
balancing
problem.
to
begin
with,
is
there
a
showing
of
some
voter
interest
by
the
candidate
and
further
is
this
substantial
interest
manifest
prior
to
the
time
of
the
election?
also,
does
the
candidate
have
some
party
structure,
some
political
organization
upon
which
he
bases
his
candidacy?
but
these
three
conceptual
elements,
i
think,
are
all
bound
together
further
by
the
question
of
the
experience
of
the
state
of
illinois
and
more
than
that,
the
practicality
or
the
pragmatics
of
the
situation.
a
state
legislative
policy
is
composed
of
a
number
of
elements.
for
example,
what
is
the
history
of
the
state?
what
are
the
peculiar
problems
of
its
geography?
what
are
the
attitudes
of
its
people?
in
a
number
of
other
elements,
all
of
which
may
be
variables
that
could
be
introduced
into
this
mix.
state
legislative
objective
is
also
based
on
an
appreciation
by
the
people
of
the
state
of
illinois
of
a
particular
political
theory
or
a
particular
political
concept.
the
constitution
does
not
compel
the
state
to
adopt
any
particular
political
philosophy
or
political
theory
which
underlies
the
legislative
objectives
which
is
served
by
this
requirement.
what
then
are
the
legislative
objectives
which
are
served
by
this
requirement?
to
begin
with,
i
think
that
there's
a
requirement
that
a
serious
candidate
must
show
some
voter
interest
in
his
candidacy.
and
a
reason
for
this
may
be
based
in
part
on
a
political
theory
appreciation
of
a
legislative
objective
by
the
state
of
illinois.
i
would
define
it
as
the
majority
plurality
theory
based
in
part.
it
would
be
in
a
situation
where
there
is
a
third
party
candidacy.
it
very
well
may
be
that
the
candidate
with
the
highest
number
of
votes
may
not
obtain
a
majority.
he
may
merely
win
by
a
plurality.
it
follows
as
a
possibility
that
in
combination,
the
third
party
may
actually
prefer
the
party
with
the
second
highest
number
of
votes
and
in
combination
the
two
together
may
actually
win
or
it's
conceivable
that
they
could
have
won
by
a
majority.
this
i
suggest
to
you
is
one
possible
political
theory
which
may
be
accepted
by
the
state
of
illinois.
mr.
richard
e.
friedman
i
don't
suggest
that
that
by
itself
mr.
justice
is
the
whole
answer.
i
would
hope
that
we
could
regard
the
situation
in
its
whole
context.
we
get
into
another
area
of
experience
and
i
suggest
this
to
you.
the
requirement
was
adopted
by
the
general
assembly
in
1935
and
it
was
first
imposed
for
the
presidential
election
of
1936.
in
1932,
the
presidential
election
immediately
prior
to
the
imposition
of
this
requirement,
there
were
four
independent
candidacies
on
the
ballot
in
illinois.
in
1936,
the
first
year
after
the
imposition
--
mr.
richard
e.
friedman
for
the
--
well,
it
was
for
presidency.
it
was
also
for
other
offices
as
well,
other
statewide
offices,
so
i
think
it's
quite
apt
in
its
broadest
view.
but
to
follow,
in
1936,
the
experience
was
that
there
were
also
four
independent
candidacies.
so
i'm
suggesting
to
you
on
a
numerical
analysis
alone,
immediately
before
and
immediately
after
the
imposition
of
these
requirements,
there
were
four
independent
candidacies
and
i
don't
think
that
we
can
demonstrate
that
a
requirement
which
is
rather
easy
to
meet
indicates
that
such
candidacies
would
flourish
nor
does
it
necessarily
follow
that
a
more
difficult
requirement
to
meet
would
indicate
that
such
candidacies
would
be
more
of
it.
i'm
only
suggesting
to
you
that
in
the
whole
political
context,
there
are
so
many
variables
that
enter
into
a
situation
in
any
given
time.
there
is
no
way
to
project
with
any
degree
of
accuracy
what
would
or
what
might
occur
in
the
future
or
what
would've
occurred
had
not
this
provision
have
been
involved.
a
second
legislative
objective
to
be
served
would
be
a
concern
by
the
state
of
illinois
that
any
proliferation
of
independent
candidacies
might
tend
to
confuse
the
voters
and
i
would
distinguish
the
ohio
situation
which
is
before
the
court
in
the
williams
case
from
the
illinois
situation.
in
ohio,
there
was
a
requirement
that
there'd
be
signatures
from
15%
of
the
voters.
the
numerical
figure
was
i
think
something
like
433,000.
in
illinois,
the
comparable
figure
is
that
we
require
only
one-half,
approximately
one-half
of
1%
of
the
total
voters
or
25,000.
so
it's
a
much
easier
provision
to
meet
in
terms
of
a
numerical
analysis
alone.
mr.
richard
e.
friedman
i
made
this
analysis
your
honor
and
i
don't
know
if
i
can
quite
need
it.
perhaps,
i
can
give
you
another
figure
which
might
be
helpful
to
you.
mr.
richard
e.
friedman
we
have
102
counties.
a
50%
rate
would
be
52.
my
study
shows
that
there
are
54
counties
in
the
state
with
more
than
15,000
voters.
perhaps
that
meets
in
part
and
doesn't
quite
hit
it
but
i
think
its
close
enough.
there
are
15,000
--
there
are
54
counties
where
there
are
more
than
15,000
voters
in
the
state
or
in
the
county.
a
third
legislative
objective
to
be
served
by
--
mr.
richard
e.
friedman
i
don't
have
those
figures
at
hand
your
honor.
i
think
i
can
give
you
a
rather
close
approximation.
mr.
richard
e.
friedman
in
terms
of
voter
registration
alone,
cook
county
has
slightly
more
than
50%.
the
balance
of
it
being
as
it
is
called
downstate
illinois
that
is
all
the
counties
other
than
cook
county.
the
relative
vote
in
cook
county
would
account
for,
i
would
say,
perhaps
60%
of
the
democratic
vote
throughout
the
state.
the
converse
would
be
true
with
the
republican
party.
downstate,
there
would
be
something
like
60%,
in
the
downstate
areas,
about
40%
in
cook
county.
it
would
be
something
like
that.
i'm
afraid
i
don't
have
specific
numbers
at
hand.
but
that
would
be
an
essential
waiting
of
the
relative
strength
of
the
parties
in
the
various
areas
of
the
state.
i
would
turn
now
to
the
third
legislative
objective
that's
served
by
this
requirement
and
that
would
be
that
a
candidate
should
have
his
support
not
limited
to
a
concentrated
locality
and
the
reason
for
that
would
be
that
a
candidate
runs
statewide,
his
policies
and
his
programs
should
have
statewide
appeal.
but
in
addition
to
that,
there's
also
a
practical
argument
that
can
be
put
forward
to
this.
any
serious
candidate
of
necessity
would
have
to
establish
some
sort
of
political
structure
at
least
in
the
major
most
populous
areas
of
the
state
of
illinois.
and
i
suggest
to
you
that
this
requirement
of
obtaining
signatures
in
these
counties
would
almost
perfectly
track
what
a
serious
political
candidate
would
have
to
do
anyway
in
developing
an
effective
campaign.
mr.
richard
e.
friedman
no,
i'm
not
suggesting
that
your
honor.
mr.
richard
e.
friedman
well,
i'm
suggesting
to
you,
yes.
to
answer
your
question,
it
is
true
that
he
would
have
to
gather
signatures
from
50
counties
but
more
than
that,
i
am
suggesting
that
if
he
wants
to
win
an
election,
he
must
establish
a
political
structure
that
should
have
headquarters
in
a
substantial
number
of
the
counties
in
the
state.
mr.
richard
e.
friedman
i
would
think
in
organizing
a
campaign,
you
would
have
to
have
a
political
organization
and
probably
all
but
the
smallest
counties,
i
would
say
that
the
number
i
gave
in
response
to
the
question
of
chief
justice
warren
would
be
that
you
probably
you
have
to
have
an
ongoing
organization
in
a
minimum
of
at
least
54
counties.
mr.
richard
e.
friedman
i'd
have
to
do
some
rapid
calculating.
mr.
richard
e.
friedman
no,
i
would
think
that
perhaps
--
well,
let
me
answer
it
this
way.
i
think
the
cook
county,
and
perhaps
the
seven
or
eight
next
most
populous
counties
in
the
state
that
there
was
substantial
trend
for
a
candidate,
i
think
he
would
be
ensured
to
be
a
winner.
mr.
richard
e.
friedman
that's
true.
mr.
justice
fortas,
i'd
suggest
that
there
might
be
a
slightly
different
focus
to
this
argument.
heretofore,
we've
been
talking
or
in
response
to
the
questions,
about
the
major
political
parties,
the
republican
and
democratic
party
but
what
we're
talking
about
here
is
the
viability
of
an
independent
candidate,
how
well
he
may
do
through
this
structure
and
i
think
that
as
a
practical
matter,
in
order
for
him
to
win,
he
would
have
to
garner
at
least
that
many
votes.
mr.
richard
e.
friedman
well,
yes
--
mr.
richard
e.
friedman
your
honor,
i
would
say
that
that's
true
but
in
addition
to
that,
there's
one
other
element
of
the
history
of
independent
parties
in
the
state
of
illinois
that
may
be
helpful
to
the
court.
that
from
the
year
1912
through
1968
in
presidential
years,
there
were
39
independent
candidacies.
this
works
out
to
approximately
2.6
per
time,
so
i'm
suggesting
to
you
that
both
prior
to
and
subsequent
to
the
imposition
of
this
requirement,
there
have
been
viable
candidacies.
but
one
further
fact
under
number
--
mr.
richard
e.
friedman
well,
2.6%
is
the
figure
that's
occurred.
it
goes
slightly
more
prior
to
the
imposition
of
this
requirement
than
after
but
it's
been
about
the
same.
mr.
richard
e.
friedman
once
again,
the
focus
of
the
case
before
us
is
not
necessarily
related
to
the
internal
operation
of
either
the
two
major
political
parties.
mr.
richard
e.
friedman
well
as
a
matter
of
practice
--
mr.
richard
e.
friedman
yes
it
is.
but
as
a
matter
of
practice,
that's
a
theoretical
possibility.
as
a
matter
of
practice,
in
putting
together
any
slate,
there
is
considerable
concern
to
making
it
as
broad-based
geographically
as
possible.
it
may
be
that
the
balance
might
be
top
heavy
in
terms
of
cook
county
but
i
think
invariably,
you
will
find
a
substantial
number
of
the
slate
in
illinois
from
counties
other
than
cook.
mr.
richard
e.
friedman
no,
i
think
not,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
e.
friedman
it's
an
obstacle
which
must
be
overcome
and
it
has
been
overcome
in
a
number
of
instances.
the
legislative
objective
that
could
be
served
would
be
as
i
indicated
before,
the
requirement
of
substantial
voter
interest,
the
concern
about
possible
proliferation
of
candidacies
and
the
like.
mr.
richard
e.
friedman
once
again,
it
would
be
speculative,
your
honor.
i
know
that
there
have
been
perhaps
every
year
since
1930
at
least
one
potential
candidate
or
potential
prime
independent
slate
that's
applied
for
application
and
has
been
denied.
now,
what
the
reasons
are,
i
don't
know.
it
relates
precisely
to
this.
mr.
richard
e.
friedman
no,
i
don't.
mr.
richard
e.
friedman
i
would
say
that
the
only
way
that
it
could
be
geographic
distributive
requirements
would
be
if
they
were
proportional
either
to
the
population
of
the
county
or
the
registered
voters
of
the
county.
in
line
with
the
suggestion
that
mr.
justice
douglas
made
in
his
dissent
macdougall
versus
green,
but
unless
that
we're
done,
i
would
say
that
you
would
simply
have
to
eliminate
all
geographic
distributive
requirements
and
the
problem
i
would
--
mr.
richard
e.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
second
basic
issue
in
this
matter
is
whether
or
not
the
illinois
requirements
amounts
to
invidious
discrimination
whether
it
constitutes
an
unreasonable
burden,
the
voters
of
the
state
of
illinois.
i
suggest
to
you
that
illinois
has
struck
a
good
balance
between
the
interest
of
the
state
of
illinois
and
the
interest
of
those
people
who
may
be
disadvantaged

this
requirement.
there
is
no
precise
or
objective
test
which
may
be
applied
to
the
situation
such
as
this
but
there
are
a

of

to

also,
does
the

a

that

and
a
reason
for

may
be
based
in

on
a
political

appreciation
of
a
legislative
objective
by
the
state

i
would
define
it
as
the
majority
plurality
theory

it
would
be
in
a

where
there
is
a

it
very
well
may
be
that
the
candidate
with
the
highest
number
of
votes
may
not
obtain
a
majority.
he
may
merely
win
by
a
plurality.
it
follows
as
a
possibility
that
in

the
third

may
actually
prefer

the

may
actually
win
or
it's

that
they
could
have
won
by

this
i
suggest
to
you
is
one
possible
political
theory
which
may
be

by
the

of

mr.

itself
mr.
justice
is
the
whole

i
would

we
get
into

other
offices
as
well,
other
statewide
offices,
so
i
think
it's
quite
apt
in
its
broadest
view.
but
to
follow,
in
1936,
the
experience
was
that
there
were
also
four
independent
candidacies.
so
i'm
suggesting
to
you
on
a
numerical
analysis
alone,
immediately
before
and
immediately
after
the
imposition
of
these
requirements,
there
were
four
independent
candidacies
and
i
don't
think
that
we
can
demonstrate
that
a
requirement
which
is
rather
easy
to
meet
indicates
that
such
candidacies
would
flourish
nor
does
it
necessarily
follow
that
a
more
difficult
requirement
to
meet
would
indicate
that
such
candidacies
would
be
more
of
it.
i'm
only
suggesting
to
you
that
in
the
whole
political
context,
there
are
so
many
variables
that
enter
into
a
situation
in
any
given
time.
there
is
no
way
to
project
with
any
degree
of
accuracy
what
would
or
what
might
occur
in
the
future
or
what
would've
occurred
had
not
this
provision
have
been
involved.
a
second
legislative
objective
to
be
served
would
be
a
concern
by
the
state
of
illinois
that
any
proliferation
of
independent
candidacies
might
tend
to
confuse
the
voters
and
i
would
distinguish
the
ohio
situation
which
is
before
the
court
in
the
williams
case
from
the
illinois
situation.
in
ohio,
there
was
a
requirement
that
there'd
be
signatures
from
15%
of
the
voters.
the
numerical
figure
was
i
think
something
like
433,000.
in
illinois,
the
comparable
figure
is
that
we
require
only
one-half,
approximately
one-half
of
1%
of
the
total
voters
or
25,000.
so
it's
a
much
easier
provision
to
meet
in
terms
of
a
numerical
analysis
alone.
mr.
richard
e.
friedman
i
made
this
analysis
your
honor
and
i
don't
know
if
i
can
quite
need
it.
perhaps,
i
can
give
you
another
figure
which
might
be
helpful
to
you.
mr.
richard
e.
friedman
we
have
102
counties.
a
50%
rate
would
be
52.
my
study
shows
that
there
are
54
counties
in
the
state
with
more
than
15,000
voters.
perhaps
that
meets
in
part
and
doesn't
quite
hit
it
but
i
think
its
close
enough.
there
are
15,000
--
there
are
54
counties
where
there
are
more
than
15,000
voters
in
the
state
or
in
the
county.
a
third
legislative
objective
to
be
served
by
--
mr.
richard
e.
friedman
i
don't
have
those
figures
at
hand
your
honor.
i
think
i
can
give
you
a
rather
close
approximation.
mr.
richard
e.
friedman
in
terms
of
voter
registration
alone,
cook
county
has
slightly
more
than
50%.
the
balance
of
it
being
as
it
is
called
downstate
illinois
that
is
all
the
counties
other
than
cook
county.
the
relative
vote
in
cook
county
would
account
for,
i
would
say,
perhaps
60%
of
the
democratic
vote
throughout
the
state.
the
converse
would
be
true
with
the
republican
party.
downstate,
there
would
be
something
like
60%,
in
the
downstate
areas,
about
40%
in
cook
county.
it
would
be
something
like
that.
i'm
afraid
i
don't
have
specific
numbers
at
hand.
but
that
would
be
an
essential
waiting
of
the
relative
strength
of
the
parties
in
the
various
areas
of
the
state.
i
would
turn
now
to
the
third
legislative
objective
that's
served
by
this
requirement
and
that
would
be
that
a
candidate
should
have
his
support
not
limited
to
a
concentrated
locality
and
the
reason
for
that
would
be
that
a
candidate
runs
statewide,
his
policies
and
his
programs
should
have
statewide
appeal.
but
in
addition
to
that,
there's
also
a
practical
argument
that
can
be
put
forward
to
this.
any
serious
candidate
of
necessity
would
have
to
establish
some
sort
of
political
structure
at
least
in
the
major
most
populous
areas
of
the
state
of
illinois.
and
i
suggest
to
you
that
this
requirement
of
obtaining
signatures
in
these
counties
would
almost
perfectly
track
what
a
serious
political
candidate
would
have
to
do
anyway
in
developing
an
effective
campaign.
mr.
richard
e.
friedman
no,
i'm
not
suggesting
that
your
honor.
mr.
richard
e.
friedman
well,
i'm
suggesting
to
you,
yes.
to
answer
your
question,
it
is
true
that
he
would
have
to
gather
signatures
from
50
counties
but
more
than
that,
i
am
suggesting
that
if
he
wants
to
win
an
election,
he
must
establish
a
political
structure
that
should
have
headquarters
in
a
substantial
number
of
the
counties
in
the
state.
mr.
richard
e.
friedman
i
would
think
in
organizing
a
campaign,
you
would
have
to
have
a
political
organization
and
probably
all
but
the
smallest
counties,
i
would
say
that
the
number
i
gave
in
response
to
the
question
of
chief
justice
warren
would
be
that
you
probably
you
have
to
have
an
ongoing
organization
in
a
minimum
of
at
least
54
counties.
mr.
richard
e.
friedman
i'd
have
to
do
some
rapid
calculating.
mr.
richard
e.
friedman
no,
i
would
think
that
perhaps
--
well,
let
me
answer
it
this
way.
i
think
the
cook
county,
and
perhaps
the
seven
or
eight
next
most
populous
counties
in
the
state
that
there
was
substantial
trend
for
a
candidate,
i
think
he
would
be
ensured
to
be
a
winner.
mr.
richard
e.
friedman
that's
true.
mr.
justice
fortas,
i'd
suggest
that
there
might
be
a
slightly
different
focus
to
this
argument.
heretofore,
we've
been
talking
or
in
response
to
the
questions,
about
the
major
political
parties,
the
republican
and
democratic
party
but
what
we're
talking
about
here
is
the
viability
of
an
independent
candidate,
how
well
he
may
do
through
this
structure
and
i
think
that
as
a
practical
matter,
in
order
for
him
to
win,
he
would
have
to
garner
at
least
that
many
votes.
mr.
richard
e.
friedman
well,
yes
--
mr.
richard
e.
friedman
your
honor,
i
would
say
that
that's
true
but
in
addition
to
that,
there's
one
other
element
of
the
history
of
independent
parties
in
the
state
of
illinois
that
may
be
helpful
to
the
court.
that
from
the
year
1912
through
1968
in
presidential
years,
there
were
39
independent
candidacies.
this
works
out
to
approximately
2.6
per
time,
so
i'm
suggesting
to
you
that
both
prior
to
and
subsequent
to
the
imposition
of
this
requirement,
there
have
been
viable
candidacies.
but
one
further
fact
under
number
--
mr.
richard
e.
friedman
well,
2.6%
is
the
figure
that's
occurred.
it
goes
slightly
more
prior
to
the
imposition
of
this
requirement
than
after
but
it's
been
about
the
same.
mr.
richard
e.
friedman
once
again,
the
focus
of
the
case
before
us
is
not
necessarily
related
to
the
internal
operation
of
either
the
two
major
political
parties.
mr.
richard
e.
friedman
well
as
a
matter
of
practice
--
mr.
richard
e.
friedman
yes
it
is.
but
as
a
matter
of
practice,
that's
a
theoretical
possibility.
as
a
matter
of
practice,
in
putting
together
any
slate,
there
is
considerable
concern
to
making
it
as
broad-based
geographically
as
possible.
it
may
be
that
the
balance
might
be
top
heavy
in
terms
of
cook
county
but
i
think
invariably,
you
will
find
a
substantial
number
of
the
slate
in
illinois
from
counties
other
than
cook.
mr.
richard
e.
friedman
no,
i
think
not,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
e.
friedman
it's
an
obstacle
which
must
be
overcome
and
it
has
been
overcome
in
a
number
of
instances.
the
legislative
objective
that
could
be
served
would
be
as
i
indicated
before,
the
requirement
of
substantial
voter
interest,
the
concern
about
possible
proliferation
of
candidacies
and
the
like.
mr.
richard
e.
friedman
once
again,
it
would
be
speculative,
your
honor.
i
know
that
there
have
been
perhaps
every
year
since
1930
at
least
one
potential
candidate
or
potential
prime
independent
slate
that's
applied
for
application
and
has
been
denied.
now,
what
the
reasons
are,
i
don't
know.
it
relates
precisely
to
this.
mr.
richard
e.
friedman
no,
i
don't.
mr.
richard
e.
friedman
i
would
say
that
the
only
way
that
it
could
be
geographic
distributive
requirements
would
be
if
they
were
proportional
either
to
the
population
of
the
county
or
the
registered
voters
of
the
county.
in
line
with
the
suggestion
that
mr.
justice
douglas
made
in
his
dissent
macdougall
versus
green,
but
unless
that
we're
done,
i
would
say
that
you
would
simply
have
to
eliminate
all
geographic
distributive
requirements
and
the
problem
i
would
--
