mr.
richard
f.
watt
if
the
court
please.
somewhat
over
20
years
ago,
i
appeared
before
this
court
and
argued
the
case
of
macdougall
versus
green
in
which
an
effort
was
being
made
to
have
declared
unconstitutional
a
statute
of
the
state
of
illinois
with
regard
to
the
right
of
new
parties
to
a
place
on
the
general
election
ballot
for
statewide
candidates.
in
that
case
which
was
decided
by
this
court
on
october
21,
1948,
a
majority
of
the
court
held
in
a
per
curiam
opinion
that
the
particular
statute
involved
was
constitutional
as
a
reasonable
exercise
of
the
state’s
power
and
specifically
it
held
that
it
was
proper
for
purposes
of
the
requirements
of
a
new
party
getting
on
the
ballot
that
the
state
could
require
25,000
signatures
of
which
at
there
must
be
not
less
than
200
signatures
from
at
least
50
different
counties.
in
the
state
of
illinois,
there
are
102
counties,
and
the
population
facts
which
were
set
out
in
the
opinion
then
are
substantially
the
same
as
they
are
now
accepted
the
disparity
between
the
more
populous
counties
of
illinois
and
the
less
populous
counties
has
somewhat
increased.
we
have
here
before
this
court
today
virtually
the
same
statute
not
on
behalf
of
a
new
party
but
on
behalf
of
independent
candidates
who
sought
to
have
themselves
placed
on
the
general
election
ballot
as
candidates
for
officers
for
the
position
of
electors
of
president,
vice
president
of
the
united
states
in
the
last
general
election.
and
we
are
asking
this
court
now
to
reexamine
macdougall
versus
green
and
to
determine
that
it
should
be
overruled.
the
issue
is
precisely
the
same.
is
it
proper
for
a
state
as
condition
of
candidates
getting
on
the
ballot,
who
are
not
the
candidates
of
one
of
the
established
political
parties?
is
it
permissible
for
the
state
to
impose
in
addition
to
numerical
standards?
is
it
permissible
that
the
state
require
that
the
numbers
of
voters
who
signify
their
determination
to
put
candidates
on
the
ballot
must
be
distributed
in
a
certain
fashion
throughout
the
state
based
upon
where
those
voters
reside?
mr.
richard
f.
watt
the
wording
is
the
same,
your
honor.
the
only
difference
is
that
there,
it
was
section
10.2
of
the
illinois
election
code
which
dealt
with
new
parties
and
here
it’s
section
10.3
which
deals
with
independent
candidates.
otherwise,
it's
precisely
the
same.
mr.
richard
f.
watt
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
f.
watt
yes,
it
is.
mr.
richard
f.
watt
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
f.
watt
in
answer
to
that
--
mr.
richard
f.
watt
i
think
that's
correct,
your
honor.
i
would
say
this.
in
the
dissent
that
mr.
justice
douglas
wrote
in
macdougall
versus
green,
there
is
the
suggestion
that
it
might
be
permissible
to
require
a
distribution
of
signatures
provided
that
the
distribution
was
proportionate
to
the
population
of
the
geographic
areas
involved.
so
that
i
suppose
you
could
state
that
if
25,000
signatures
were
required,
it
would
be
permissible
for
the
state
at
that
point
to
say
those
25,000
signatures
must
be
distributed
throughout
the
state
in
proportion
to
the
voting
population
of
the
various
counties.
that
particular
issue
is
not
here,
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
f.
watt
that
is
correct.
you
could
not
get
the
candidates
on
the
ballot
under
those
circumstances.
mr.
richard
f.
watt
that
is
correct.
but
i
think
i
would
interpret
this
court's
decision
in
reynolds
versus
sims
as
indicating
that
absent
some
of
remarkable
showing
of
the
purpose
of
geographic
distribution
of
voters,
that
if
the
unit
with
respect
to
which
the
candidates
are
concerned,
let
us
say
a
statewide
that
then
the
validity
and
affect
of
a
voter's
indication
of
his
intent
should
have
nothing
to
do
with
where
he
lives.
and
since,
we
elect
in
illinois,
the
candidates
for
statewide
office
on
a
statewide
basis,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
there's
a
good
reason
for
arguing
that
if
you
began
imposing
even
some
geographic
distribution
proportionate
to
population
as
a
condition
of
putting
the
candidates
on
the
ballot,
that
this
might
well
in
itself
be
an
invalid
research.
mr.
richard
f.
watt
i
would
agree
with
that
your
honor.
i
think
to
the
certain
extent,
the
court
has
already
in
some
of
its
decisions.
as
you
describe
it
gone
far
broad
in
so
far
as
it
is
indicated,
the
irrelevancy
of
geographic
location
of
where
a
voter
happens
to
live.
it
makes
no
difference.
it
should
make
no
difference
how
much
his
vote
counts,
dependent
upon
whether
he
lives
in
a
small
county
or
a
large
county.
mr.
richard
f.
watt
that
is
correct.
but
it
would
be
our
position
--
mr.
richard
f.
watt
but
there
is
no
requirement
in
the
constitution
as
to
the
manner
in
which
states
provide
for
the
nomination
of
the
presidential
electors.
mr.
richard
f.
watt
no
it
does
not.
the
--
mr.
richard
f.
watt
all
statewide
officers.
the
only
reason
that
we
are
here
concerned
only
with
presidential
electors
is
because
the
petitions
which
were
filed
were
simply
petitions
for
the
nomination
of
26
presidential
electors
from
the
state
of
illinois.
mr.
richard
f.
watt
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
f.
watt
it
affects
all
independent
candidates
for
statewide
office
in
the
state
of
illinois
and
that
would
be
united
states
senator,
governor,
lieutenant
governor
and
so
on.
mr.
richard
f.
watt
that
is
correct.
i
would
not
say
that
the
state
could
not
impose
a
different
numerical
total
as
a
proper
condition
for
getting
on
the
ballot
and
the
statute
prior
to
1935
in
illinois
simply
required
the
total
of
25,000.
there
was
an
amendment
in
1935
which
added
the
geographical
distribution.
mr.
richard
f.
watt
correct.
in
violation
of
the
equal
protection
clause
and
basically
in
line
with
the
dissenting
opinion
of
mr.
justice
douglas
wrote
in
macdougall
versus
green
and
as
that
view
in
our
position
as
we
see
it
at
least
has
been
adopted
by
this
court
in
reynolds
versus
sims
and
in
subsequent
cases.
for
the
decisions
below
was
based
substantially
upon
the
binding
effect
of
macdougall
versus
green.
the
three-judge
court
which
heard
the
matter
took
the
position
that
if
macdougall
versus
green
was
to
be
viewed
as
no
longer
the
law
that
it
should
not
be
the
task
of
three-judge
court
to
make
that
decision.
and
in
our
argument
before
the
three-judge
court
by
briefs,
it
was
--
we
contended
that
reynolds
versus
sims
has
substantially
undercut
the
theory
by
which
this
court
in
macdougall
versus
green
upheld
the
statutory
requirement
and
the
view
of
this
court
at
that
time
was
that
it
was
perfectly
permissible
for
a
state
as
a
condition
of
permitting
candidates
on
the
ballot
by
nomination
petition
to
show
that
those
candidates
had
support
which
was
not
confined
to
one
geographic
area.
well,
as
mr.
justice
fortas
has
pointed
out,
population
statistics
of
illinois
really
rather
startling.
well,
over
50%
of
the
registered
voters
reside
in
one
county,
cook
county.
well,
over
60%
reside
in
the
five
most
populous
counties.
and
the
49
most
populous
counties
have
93.6%
of
the
--
approximately
93.6%
of
the
registered
voters
which
means
that
any
combination
of
voters
no
matter
how
you
distribute
them
from
those
49
counties
could
not
under
this
statute
put
independent
candidates
or
new
party
candidates
on
the
ballot.
they
would
have
to
have
signatures
from
additional
counties.
now,
one
of
the
necessary
effects
of
this
and
i
think
everybody
who
has
ever
had
anything
to
do
with
nomination
petitions
in
which
signatures
are
required,
it's
always
desirable
when
you
file
petitions
to
have
surplus
of
signatures.
it
may
turn
out
that
some
of
the
people
who
signed
think
they
are
registered
voters
when
in
fact
they
are
not.
it
may
turn
out
that
some
individuals
have
moved
from
one
residence
to
another
and
that
their
registered
voting
residence
is
different
from
what
they
put
on
the
petition.
it
may
be
that
some
signatures
are
illegible
and
consequently,
you
cannot
to
be
absolutely
certain
that
if
you
just
file
25,000
that
you
will
have
a
sufficient
number
of
valid
signatures.
consequently,
anyone
preparing
petitions
of
this
kind
would
naturally
want
to
have
some
margin
but
you
could
have
any
size
of
margin
of
additional
signatures
from
cook
county
or
anyone
of
49
other
counties
and
none
of
those
signatures
would
be
sufficient
to
put
you
over
the
top,
so
to
speak.
now,
you
could
have
hundreds
of
thousands
of
signatures
and
in
effect,
those
additional
signatures
would
not
count.
so
that
at
a
certain
point,
an
individual
from
cook
county
who
signs
a
petition
of
this
kind
is
in
effect
having
his
signature
simply
disregarded
because
it
is
irrelevant
to
the
requirement
and
it
will
not
count
so
to
speak
to
offset
the
lack
of
signatures
from
many
of
the
other
counties.
it
seems
to
me
under
those
circumstances,
that
you
have
essentially
the
same
kind
of
problem
as
this
court
has
concerned
itself
with
where
you
have
gross
malapportionment.
the
effective
weight
of
one
voter's
indication
of
his
position
whether
by
signing
a
nomination
petition
or
by
voting
really
depends
upon
where
he
lives.
if
he
lives
in
a
small
county,
it
will
count.
if
he
lives
in
a
large
county,
it
may
not
count
at
all.
as
we
read
reynolds
versus
sims,
this
court
has
determined
as
a
general
principle
that
the
weight
of
a
citizen's
vote
cannot
be
made
to
depend
upon
where
he
lives
and
--
mr.
richard
f.
watt
if
the
macdougall
case
is
cited
in
footnote
40,
mr.
justice
douglas'
dissent
is
cited
and
the
only
way
i
can
describe
it,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
principles
set
out
by
mr.
justice
douglas'
dissent
are
cited
approvingly
by
the
majority
of
this
court,
reynolds
versus
sims.
mr.
richard
f.
watt
that
was
the
extent
of
the
treatment
of
the
decision
itself.
mr.
richard
f.
watt
there
was
discussion
of
the
significance
of
macdougall
versus
green
in
so
far
as
it
possibly
was
the
first
case
of
a
political
--
this
kind
of
political
problem
in
which
the
court
decided
the
issue
on
the
merits
rather
than
simply
saying
that
this
was
the
kind
of
political
thicket
into
which
the
court
would
not
go.
so
that
in
1948,
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
macdougall
versus
green
decided
the
issue
on
the
merits
and
did
not
take
the
out
of
considering
that
it's
non-justiciable.
mr.
richard
f.
watt
i
think
that's
different
in
this
sense
your
honor.
mr.
richard
f.
watt
that
is
correct.
but
they
were
elected
at
large
by
the
votes
of
all
the
citizens
that
were
eligible
to
vote
overall
in
the
community.
even
though
the
candidates,
there
has
to
be
candidates
geographically
spaced
so
to
speak.
the
effect
of
the
voter's
vote
had
nothing
to
do
with
where
he
happened
to
live.
mr.
richard
f.
watt
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
f.
watt
that
is
correct.
now,
as
i
understand
the
position
taken
by
the
state
of
illinois
and
asking
that
this
decision
of
the
court
below
be
affirmed,
it
is
essentially,
first,
that
we
really
don't
have
an
election
here,
that
in
illinois,
presidential
electors
get
on
the
ballot
so
far
as
established
parties
are
concerned
by
the
action
of
state
conventions.
and
therefore,
there
is
nothing
in
the
nature
of
a
primary
to
get
them
on
the
ballot.
they
are
placed
on
the
ballot
by
virtue
of
official
action
of
the
state
convention.
and
secondly,
that
here
we
are
concerned
with
nomination
petitions
and
not
the
equivalent
of
election.
it
seems
to
me
that
that
argument
simply
cannot
stand
because
the
question
is
whether
or
not
the
procedure
is
an
essential
and
integral
part
of
the
election
process.
however,
an
individual
gets
officially
on
the
ballot
under
a
statutory
scheme,
that
statutory
scheme
is
part
of
the
election
machinery.
if
it's
by
nomination
petition
or
if
it's
by
primary
election,
it
seems
to
me
the
standards
should
be
precisely
the
same,
namely.
what
is
the
effect
of
a
voter
doing
something?
it
cannot
seem
logical
to
me,
at
least,
that
he
must
have
his
vote
counted
regardless
of
where
he
lives
and
his
vote
must
count
equally
where
the
vote
of
every
other
voter
if
it's
a
primary
election
that
is
concerned.
but
that
it
is
perfectly
alright
to
discriminate
against
him
and
wait
the
votes
of
some
individuals
when
what
you're
counting
are
signatures
on
a
nomination
petition.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
process
is
essentially
part
of
the
election
machinery
and
it
should
meet
the
same
standards.
the
second
argument
that
the
state
makes
is
that
somehow
rather
what
we
are
seeking
here
would
interfere
with
the
scheme
for
independent
candidates
and
new
party
candidates.
i
really
don't
understand
that
argument
because
as
i
suggested
a
moment
before,
the
original
requirement
in
illinois
prior
to
1935
was
simply
25,000
signatures
regardless
of
where
they
came
from
in
the
state
and
that
the
only
effect
of
a
decision
here
determining
the
unconstitutionality
of
the
amendment
would
as
has
been
determined
by
many
illinois
cases
leave
the
underlying
statute
intact
and
therefore
if
this
amendment
were
determined
to
be
unconstitutional,
the
underlying
statutory
scheme
of
25,000
signatures
for
statewide
candidates
would
continue
as
a
perfectly
valid
enactment
of
the
state
legislature.
so
we
do
not
think
that
a
decision
by
this
court
in
any
respect
would
interfere
with
a
perfectly
understandable
and
valid
procedure
and
that
the
only
effect
of
the
court's
decision
overruling
macdougall
versus
green
would
be
to
eliminate
a
kind
of
unconstitutional
restriction
upon
the
nomination
process
by
petitioner.
so
we
would
ask
this
court
to
do
what
we
think
the
court
in
effect
has
already
done
and
that
is
by
its
decisions
in
such
cases
as
gray
versus
sanders
and
reynolds
versus
sims
to
recognize
that
this
kind
of
geographic
requirement
which
has
the
necessary
effect
of
giving
more
weight
to
one
voter's
influence
than
to
another
should
be
considered
unconstitutional
regardless
of
whether
all
we're
concerned
with
is
a
nomination
process
by
petition
in
as
much
as
the
petitions
are
an
essential
means
for
new
party
and
independent
party
candidates
to
get
on
the
ballot.
i
have
no
further
argument
mr.
justice
--
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
richard
f.
watt
you
may.
mr.
o'toole.
mr.
richard
f.
watt
just
one
very
brief
comment
if
i
may.
mr.
friedman
has
indicated
certain
theoretical
justification
for
the
requirement
and
these
are
really
a
matter
of
political
theory.
i
would
suggest
they're
also
a
matter
of
speculation.
in
the
state
of
illinois
unfortunately,
we
do
not
have
the
kind
of
material
which
makes
it
possible
to
determine
what
the
legislature
really
had
in
mind
when
it
adopted
any
given
piece
of
legislation.
we
do
not
have
the
raw
material
for
determining
legislative
history
and
legislative
intent,
so
that
in
order
to
speculate
that
there's
a
particular
theory
back
of
this,
i
would
say
that
its
interesting
speculation
but
i
don't
think
that
it
is
anything
which
this
court
can
rely
on
in
determining
what
the
legislature
had
in
mind
in
1935.
i
honestly
don't
know
and
i
seriously
doubt
if
there's
anyway
of
finding
out.
as
to
whether
this
is
a
substantial
obstacle
or
not,
i
think
the
answer
is
clear
that
it
is.
that
it
is.
there
are
many,
many
counties
in
illinois
where
there
are
fewer
than
10,000
registered
voters
and
furthermore,
there's
one
additional
requirement
that
must
be
kept
in
mind
with
regard
to
ballot
signatures
for
a
nominating
a
petition.
anybody
who
voted
in
either
the
democratic
or
republican
primary
is
ineligible
to
sign
a
petition
for
either
an
independent
candidate
or
a
new
party
candidate.
the
result
is
that
it
is
not
simply
sufficient
to
look
to
the
total
number
of
registered
voters
in
any
given
county.
you
also
have
to
take
into
account
that
many
of
them
as
potential
signors
of
petitions
are
automatically
eliminated
if
they
voted
either
the
republican
or
democratic
primary,
so
this
makes
the
obstacle
a
little
bit
tougher
to
get
over.
i
don't
think
there's
any
doubt
that
this
particular
requirement
can
be
met
but
i
also
don't
think
there's
any
doubt
that
it
is
in
a
number
instances
kept
people
from
the
ballot.
mr.
richard
f.
watt
a
new
party
would
get
in
by
filing
petitions
with
the
required
number
of
signatures
of
qualified
voters
who
had
not
voted
in
one
of
the
party
primaries
and
if
the
total
number
of
valid
signatures
was
up
to
the
minimum
required,
then
that
group
of
candidates
or
that
individual
candidate
should
go
on
the
ballot.
mr.
richard
f.
watt
it
would
make
no
difference
from
what
county.
mr.
richard
f.
watt
just
from
the
state.
mr.
richard
f.
watt
well,
i
suppose
you
could
have
almost
any
variety
of
techniques
for
getting
independents
or
new
party
candidates
on
the
ballot
mr.
justice
black.
in
england,
as
i
understand
it,
you
pay
a
deposit
and
simply
sign
papers
and
pay
a
deposit
of
200
pounds
for
certain
offices
and
if
you
fail
to
get
a
requisite
number
of
the
votes,
you
forfeit
your
200
pounds.
i
have
not
heard
that
in
england,
they
have
a
terrible
problem
of
proliferation
of
political
parties.
i
think
this
is
really
an
unreal
fear
that's
used
to
justify
a
technique
which
realistically
has
a
tendency
to
monopolize
the
ballot
of
the
existing
parties.
thank
you.
mr.
richard
f.
watt
if
the
court
please.
somewhat
over
20
years
ago,
i
appeared
before
this
court
and
argued
the
case
of
macdougall
versus
green
in
which
an
effort
was
being
made
to
have
declared
unconstitutional
a
statute
of
the
state
of
illinois
with
regard
to
the
right
of
new
parties
to
a
place
on
the
general
election
ballot
for
statewide
candidates.
in
that
case
which
was
decided
by
this
court
on
october
21,
1948,
a
majority
of
the
court
held
in
a
per
curiam
opinion
that
the
particular
statute
involved
was
constitutional
as
a
reasonable
exercise
of
the
state’s
power
and
specifically
it
held
that
it
was
proper
for
purposes
of
the
requirements
of
a
new
party
getting
on
the
ballot
that
the
state
could
require
25,000
signatures
of
which
at
there
must
be
not
less
than
200
signatures
from
at
least
50
different
counties.
in
the
state
of
illinois,
there
are
102
counties,
and
the
population
facts
which
were
set
out
in
the
opinion
then
are
substantially
the
same
as
they
are
now
accepted
the
disparity
between
the
more
populous
counties
of
illinois
and
the
less
populous
counties
has
somewhat
increased.
we
have
here
before
this
court
today
virtually
the
same
statute
not
on
behalf
of
a
new
party
but
on
behalf
of
independent
candidates
who
sought
to
have
themselves
placed
on
the
general
election
ballot
as
candidates
for
officers
for
the
position
of
electors
of
president,
vice
president
of
the
united
states
in
the
last
general
election.
and
we
are
asking
this
court
now
to
reexamine
macdougall
versus
green
and
to
determine
that
it
should
be
overruled.
the
issue
is
precisely
the
same.
is
it
proper
for
a
state
as
condition
of
candidates
getting
on
the
ballot,
who
are
not
the
candidates
of
one
of
the
established
political
parties?
is
it
permissible
for
the
state
to
impose
in
addition
to
numerical
standards?
is
it
permissible
that
the
state
require
that
the
numbers
of
voters
who
signify
their
determination
to
put
candidates
on
the
ballot
must
be
distributed
in
a
certain
fashion
throughout
the
state
based
upon
where
those
voters
reside?
mr.
richard
f.
watt
the
wording
is
the
same,
your
honor.
the
only
difference
is
that
there,
it
was
section
10.2
of
the
illinois
election
code
which
dealt
with
new
parties
and
here
it’s
section
10.3
which
deals
with
independent
candidates.
otherwise,
it's
precisely
the
same.
mr.
richard
f.
watt
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
f.
watt
yes,
it
is.
mr.
richard
f.
watt
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
f.
watt
in
answer
to
that
--
mr.
richard
f.
watt
i
think
that's
correct,
your
honor.
i
would
say
this.
in
the
dissent
that
mr.
justice
douglas
wrote
in
macdougall
versus
green,
there
is
the
suggestion
that
it
might
be
permissible
to
require
a
distribution
of
signatures
provided
that
the
distribution
was
proportionate
to
the
population
of
the
geographic
areas
involved.
so
that
i
suppose
you
could
state
that
if
25,000
signatures
were
required,
it
would
be
permissible
for
the
state
at
that
point
to
say
those
25,000
signatures
must
be
distributed
throughout
the
state
in
proportion
to
the
voting
population
of
the
various
counties.
that
particular
issue
is
not
here,
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
f.
watt
that
is
correct.
you
could
not
get
the
candidates
on
the
ballot
under
those
circumstances.
mr.
richard
f.
watt
that
is
correct.
but
i
think
i
would
interpret
this
court's
decision
in
reynolds
versus
sims
as
indicating
that
absent
some
of
remarkable
showing
of
the
purpose
of
geographic
distribution
of
voters,
that
if
the
unit
with
respect
to
which
the
candidates
are
concerned,
let
us
say
a
statewide
that
then
the
validity
and
affect
of
a
voter's
indication
of
his
intent
should
have
nothing
to
do
with
where
he
lives.
and
since,
we
elect
in
illinois,
the
candidates
for
statewide
office
on
a
statewide
basis,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
there's
a
good
reason
for
arguing
that
if
you
began
imposing
even
some
geographic
distribution
proportionate
to
population
as
a
condition
of
putting
the
candidates
on
the
ballot,
that
this
might
well
in
itself
be
an
invalid
research.
mr.
richard
f.
watt
i
would
agree
with
that
your
honor.
i
think
to
the
certain
extent,
the
court
has
already
in
some
of
its
decisions.
as
you
describe
it
gone
far
broad
in
so
far
as
it
is
indicated,
the
irrelevancy
of
geographic
location
of
where
a
voter
happens
to
live.
it
makes
no
difference.
it
should
make
no
difference
how
much
his
vote
counts,
dependent
upon
whether
he
lives
in
a
small
county
or
a
large
county.
mr.
richard
f.
watt
that
is
correct.
but
it
would
be
our
position
--
mr.
richard
f.
watt
but
there
is
no
requirement
in
the
constitution
as
to
the
manner
in
which
states
provide
for
the
nomination
of
the
presidential
electors.
mr.
richard
f.
watt
no
it
does
not.
the
--
mr.
richard
f.
watt
all
statewide
officers.
the
only
reason
that
we
are
here
concerned
only
with
presidential
electors
is
because
the
petitions
which
were
filed
were
simply
petitions
for
the
nomination
of
26
presidential
electors
from
the
state
of
illinois.
mr.
richard
f.
watt
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
f.
watt
it
affects
all
independent
candidates
for
statewide
office
in
the
state
of
illinois
and
that
would
be
united
states
senator,
governor,
lieutenant
governor
and
so
on.
mr.
richard
f.
watt
that
is
correct.
i
would
not
say
that
the
state
could
not
impose
a
different
numerical
total
as
a
proper
condition
for
getting
on
the
ballot
and
the
statute
prior
to
1935
in
illinois
simply
required
the
total
of
25,000.
there
was
an
amendment
in
1935
which
added
the
geographical
distribution.
mr.
richard
f.
watt
correct.
in
violation
of
the
equal
protection
clause
and
basically
in
line
with
the
dissenting
opinion
of
mr.
justice
douglas
wrote
in
macdougall
versus
green
and
as
that
view
in
our
position
as
we
see
it
at
least
has
been
adopted
by
this
court
in
reynolds
versus
sims
and
in
subsequent
cases.
for
the
decisions
below
was
based
substantially
upon
the
binding
effect
of
macdougall
versus
green.
the
three-judge
court
which
heard
the
matter
took
the
position
that
if
macdougall
versus
green
was
to
be
viewed
as
no
longer
the
law
that
it
should
not
be
the
task
of
three-judge
court
to
make
that
decision.
and
in
our
argument
before
the
three-judge
court
by
briefs,
it
was
--
we
contended
that
reynolds
versus
sims
has
substantially
undercut
the
theory
by
which
this
court
in
macdougall
versus
green
upheld
the
statutory
requirement
and
the
view
of
this
court
at
that
time
was
that
it
was
perfectly
permissible
for
a
state
as
a
condition
of
permitting
candidates
on
the
ballot
by
nomination
petition
to
show
that
those
candidates
had
support
which
was
not
confined
to
one
geographic
area.
well,
as
mr.
justice
fortas
has
pointed
out,
population
statistics
of
illinois
really
rather
startling.
well,
over
50%
of
the
registered
voters
reside
in
one
county,
cook
county.
well,
over
60%
reside
in
the
five
most
populous
counties.
and
the
49
most
populous
counties
have
93.6%
of
the
--
approximately
93.6%
of
the
registered
voters
which
means
that
any
combination
of
voters
no
matter
how
you
distribute
them
from
those
49
counties
could
not
under
this
statute
put
independent
candidates
or
new
party
candidates
on
the
ballot.
they
would
have
to
have
signatures
from
additional
counties.
now,
one
of
the
necessary
effects
of
this
and
i
think
everybody
who
has
ever
had
anything
to
do
with
nomination
petitions
in
which
signatures
are
required,
it's
always
desirable
when
you
file
petitions
to
have
surplus
of
signatures.
it
may
turn
out
that
some
of
the
people
who
signed
think
they
are
registered
voters
when
in
fact
they
are
not.
it
may
turn
out
that
some
individuals
have
moved
from
one
residence
to
another
and
that
their
registered
voting
residence
is
different
from
what
they
put
on
the
petition.
it
may
be
that
some
signatures
are
illegible
and
consequently,
you
cannot
to
be
absolutely
certain
that
if
you
just
file
25,000
that
you
will
have
a
sufficient
number
of
valid
signatures.
consequently,
anyone
preparing
petitions
of
this
kind
would
naturally
want
to
have
some
margin
but
you
could
have
any
size
of
margin
of
additional
signatures
from
cook
county
or
anyone
of
49
other
counties
and
none
of
those
signatures
would
be
sufficient
to
put
you
over
the
top,
so
to
speak.
now,
you
could
have
hundreds
of
thousands
of
signatures
and
in
effect,
those
additional
signatures
would
not
count.
so
that
at
a
certain
point,
an
individual
from
cook
county
who
signs
a
petition
of
this
kind
is
in
effect
having
his
signature
simply
disregarded
because
it
is
irrelevant
to
the
requirement
and
it
will
not
count
so
to
speak
to
offset
the
lack
of
signatures
from
many
of
the
other
counties.
it
seems
to
me
under
those
circumstances,
that
you
have
essentially
the
same
kind
of
problem
as
this
court
has
concerned
itself
with
where
you
have
gross
malapportionment.
the
effective
weight
of
one
voter's
indication
of
his
position
whether
by
signing
a
nomination
petition
or
by
voting
really
depends
upon
where
he
lives.
if
he
lives
in
a
small
county,
it
will
count.
if
he
lives
in
a
large
county,
it
may
not
count
at
all.
as
we
read
reynolds
versus
sims,
this
court
has
determined
as
a
general
principle
that
the
weight
of
a
citizen's
vote
cannot
be
made
to
depend
upon
where
he
lives
and
--
mr.
richard
f.
watt
if
the
macdougall
case
is
cited
in
footnote
40,
mr.
justice
douglas'
dissent
is
cited
and
the
only
way
i
can
describe
it,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
principles
set
out
by
mr.
justice
douglas'
dissent
are
cited
approvingly
by
the
majority
of
this
court,
reynolds
versus
sims.
mr.
richard
f.
watt
that
was
the
extent
of
the
treatment
of
the
decision
itself.
mr.
richard
f.
watt
there
was
discussion
of
the
significance
of
macdougall
versus
green
in
so
far
as
it
possibly
was
the
first
case
of
a
political
--
this
kind
of
political
problem
in
which
the
court
decided
the
issue
on
the
merits
rather
than
simply
saying
that
this
was
the
kind
of
political
thicket
into
which
the
court
would
not
go.
so
that
in
1948,
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
macdougall
versus
green
decided
the
issue
on
the
merits
and
did
not
take
the
out
of
considering
that
it's
non-justiciable.
mr.
richard
f.
watt
i
think
that's
different
in
this
sense
your
honor.
mr.
richard
f.
watt
that
is
correct.
but
they
were
elected
at
large
by
the
votes
of
all
the
citizens
that
were
eligible
to
vote
overall
in
the
community.
even
though
the
candidates,
there
has
to
be
candidates
geographically
spaced
so
to
speak.
the
effect
of
the
voter's
vote
had
nothing
to
do
with
where
he
happened
to
live.
mr.
richard
f.
watt
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
f.
watt
that
is
correct.
now,
as
i
understand
the
position
taken
by
the
state
of
illinois
and
asking
that
this
decision
of
the
court
below
be
affirmed,
it
is
essentially,
first,
that
we
really
don't
have
an
election
here,
that
in
illinois,
presidential
electors
get
on
the
ballot
so
far
as
established
parties
are
concerned
by
the
action
of
state
conventions.
and
therefore,
there
is
nothing
in
the
nature
of
a
primary
to
get
them
on
the
ballot.
they
are
placed
on
the
ballot
by
virtue
of
official
action
of
the
state
convention.
and
secondly,
that
here
we
are
concerned
with
nomination
petitions
and
not
the
equivalent
of
election.
it
seems
to
me
that
that
argument
simply
cannot
stand
because
the
question
is
whether
or
not
the
procedure
is
an
essential
and
integral
part
of
the
election
process.
however,
an
individual
gets
officially
on
the
ballot
under
a
statutory
scheme,
that
statutory
scheme
is
part
of
the
election
machinery.
if
it's
by
nomination
petition
or
if
it's
by
primary
election,
it
seems
to
me
the
standards
should
be
precisely
the
same,
namely.
what
is
the
effect
of
a
voter
doing
something?
it
cannot
seem
logical
to
me,
at
least,
that
he
must
have
his
vote
counted
regardless
of
where
he
lives
and
his
vote
must
count
equally
where
the
vote
of
every
other
voter
if
it's
a
primary
election
that
is
concerned.
but
that
it
is
perfectly
alright
to
discriminate
against
him
and
wait
the
votes
of
some
individuals
when
what
you're
counting
are
signatures
on
a
nomination
petition.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
process
is
essentially
part
of
the
election
machinery
and
it
should
meet
the
same
standards.
the
second
argument
that
the
state
makes
is
that
somehow
rather
what
we
are
seeking
here
would
interfere
with
the
scheme
for
independent
candidates
and
new
party
candidates.
i
really
don't
understand
that
argument
because
as
i
suggested
a
moment
before,
the
original
requirement
in
illinois
prior
to
1935
was
simply
25,000
signatures
regardless
of
where
they
came
from
in
the
state
and
that
the
only
effect
of
a
decision
here
determining
the
unconstitutionality
of
the
amendment
would
as
has
been
determined
by
many
illinois
cases
leave
the
underlying
statute
intact
and
therefore
if
this
amendment
were
determined
to
be
unconstitutional,
the
underlying
statutory
scheme
of
25,000
signatures
for
statewide
candidates
would
continue
as
a
perfectly
valid
enactment
of
the
state
legislature.
so
we
do
not
think
that
a
decision
by
this
court
in
any
respect
would
interfere
with
a
perfectly
understandable
and
valid
procedure
and
that
the
only
effect
of
the
court's
decision
overruling
macdougall
versus
green
would
be
to
eliminate
a
kind
of
unconstitutional
restriction
upon
the
nomination
process
by
petitioner.
so
we
would
ask
this
court
to
do
what
we
think
the
court
in
effect
has
already
done
and
that
is
by
its
decisions
in
such
cases
as
gray
versus
sanders
and
reynolds
versus
sims
to
recognize
that
this
kind
of
geographic
requirement
which
has
the
necessary
effect
of
giving
more
weight
to
one
voter's
influence
than
to
another
should
be
considered
unconstitutional
regardless
of
whether
all
we're
concerned
with
is
a
nomination
process
by
petition
in
as
much
as
the
petitions
are
an
essential
means
for
new
party
and
independent
party
candidates
to
get
on
the
ballot.
i
have
no
further
argument
mr.
justice
--
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
richard
f.
watt
you
may.
mr.
o'toole.
mr.
richard
f.
watt
just
one
very
brief
comment
if
i
may.
mr.
friedman
has
indicated
certain
theoretical
justification
for
the
requirement
and
these
are
really
a
matter
of
political
theory.
i
would
suggest
they're
also
a
matter
of
speculation.
in
the
state
of
illinois
unfortunately,
we
do
not
have
the
kind
of
material
which
makes
it
possible
to
determine
what
the
legislature
really
had
in
mind
when
it
adopted
any
given
piece
of
legislation.
we
do
not
have
the
raw
material
for
determining
legislative
history
and
legislative
intent,
so
that
in
order
to
speculate
that
there's
a
particular
theory
back
of
this,
i
would
say
that
its
interesting
speculation
but
i
don't
think
that
it
is
anything
which
this
court
can
rely
on
in
determining
what
the
legislature
had
in
mind
in
1935.
i
honestly
don't
know
and
i
seriously
doubt
if
there's
anyway
of
finding
out.
as
to
whether
this
is
a
substantial
obstacle
or
not,
i
think
the
answer
is
clear
that
it
is.
that
it
is.
there
are
many,
many
counties
in
illinois
where
there
are
fewer
than
10,000
registered
voters
and
furthermore,
there's
one
additional
requirement
that
must
be
kept
in
mind
with
regard
to
ballot
signatures
for
a
nominating
a
petition.
anybody
who
voted
in
either
the
democratic
or
republican
primary
is
ineligible
to
sign
a
petition
for
either
an
independent
candidate
or
a
new
party
candidate.
the
result
is
that
it
is
not
simply
sufficient
to
look
to
the
total
number
of
registered
voters
in
any
given
county.
you
also
have
to
take
into
account
that
many
of
them
as
potential
signors
of
petitions
are
automatically
eliminated
if
they
voted
either
the
republican
or
democratic
primary,
so
this
makes
the
obstacle
a
little
bit
tougher
to
get
over.
i
don't
think
there's
any
doubt
that
this
particular
requirement
can
be
met
but
i
also
don't
think
there's
any
doubt
that
it
is
in
a
number
instances
kept
people
from
the
ballot.
mr.
richard
f.
watt
a
new
party
would
get
in
by
filing
petitions
with
the
required
number
of
signatures
of
qualified
voters
who
had
not
voted
in
one
of
the
party
primaries
and
if
the
total
number
of
valid
signatures
was
up
to
the
minimum
required,
then
that
group
of
candidates
or
that
individual
candidate
should
go
on
the
ballot.
mr.
richard
f.
watt
it
would
make
no
difference
from
what
county.
mr.
richard
f.
watt
just
from
the
state.
mr.
richard
f.
watt
well,
i
suppose
you
could
have
almost
any
variety
of
techniques
for
getting
independents
or
new
party
candidates
on
the
ballot
mr.
justice
black.
in
england,
as
i
understand
it,
you
pay
a
deposit
and
simply
sign
papers
and
pay
a
deposit
of
200
pounds
for
certain
offices
and
if
you
fail
to
get
a
requisite
number
of
the
votes,
you
forfeit
your
200
pounds.
i
have
not
heard
that
in
england,
they
have
a
terrible
problem
of
proliferation
of
political
parties.
i
think
this
is
really
an
unreal
fear
that's
used
to
justify
a
technique
which
realistically
has
a
tendency
to
monopolize
the
ballot
of
the
existing
parties.
thank
you.
