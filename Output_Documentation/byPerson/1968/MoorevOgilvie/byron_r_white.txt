justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
your
basic
argument
that
25,000
signatures
should
suffice
wherever
the
25,000
happen
to
live?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
just
say
that
geographic
distribution
is
unconstitutional?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
what
do
you
do
with
the
dusch
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
there
--
there
the
requirement
was
that
a
candidate
had
to
live
in
certain
district,
so
there
is
a
geographical
qualification
on
the
candidate
himself.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
here,
it's
not
the
candidate
but
its
supporters
who
have
to
live
in
a
certain
place.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
unless
they
live
in
a
certain
place,
he
can't
even
get
on
the
ballot.
justice
byron
r.
white
couldn't
the
people
of
cook
county
through
the
control
of
the
party
nominate
a
candidate
for
the
general
election?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
through
the
party.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes
and
who
control.
justice
byron
r.
white
don't
you
have
--
do
you
have
some
rules
in
your
state
which
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
does
it
take
--
what
does
it
take
in
a
statewide
convention
of
the
democratic
party
in
illinois
for
a
man
to
be
nominated
as
a
candidate
of
that
party?
justice
byron
r.
white
just
one?
just
one
candidate
from
every
county?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
comprise
your
state
convention?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
101
people
will
be
in
your
state
convention?
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
that
an
issue
comes
up
in
the
state
convention
and
you
have
a
vote
in
the
state
convention
and
all
the
cook
county
representatives
vote
the
same
way,
will
the
cook
county
representation
carry
the
state
convention?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
cook
county
obviously
can
get
itself
--
can
get
a
candidate
on
the
primary
ballot.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
i
understand
that
a
democrat
on
the
primary
ballot.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
mean
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
how
many
votes
does
it
take
to
get
a
person
on
a
primary
ballot
by
--
through
the
convention.
i
mean
the
convention.
if
you
get
him
at
the
ultimate
convention,
you
will
get
on
the
ballot,
won't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
can
more
than
one
get
a
sure
majority
in
the
convention?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
then
you
mean
you
never
have
a
primary
in
illinois?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
see.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
party
--
the
party
itself
then
just
actually
just
puts
up
one
candidate.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
people
of
cook
county
may
operate
it
through
the
party
put
a
man
on
the
general
election
ballot
for
statewide
office.
justice
byron
r.
white
could
be
a
clumsy
one
to
get
at
this
objective
in
this
provision.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
mean
the
requirement
doesn't
mean
much
anyway
even
in
serving
state
interest,
if
it's
your
state
interest
is
to
keep
down
too
many
independent
candidates.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
interest
does
the
state
have
in
system
that
permits
the
democrats
of
cook
county,
as
to
democrats
from
one
county
operating
through
their
convention
to
put
a
presidential
elector
on
the
ballot
and
all
of
the
independents
in
cook
county
no
matter
how
many
they
are
can't
get
a
presidential
elector
on
the
ballot?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i'm
just
suggesting
that
--
i'm
just
suggesting
that
this
necessarily
is
part
of
the
case,
isn't
it,
when
an
independent
claim
has
been
denied
equal
protection
as
a
law
because
he
has
to
get
200
signatures
on
50
counties
and
yet
maybe
25,000
democrats
in
cook
county
operating
through
their
convention
or
did
all
the
democrats
in
cook
county
operating
through
their
convention
can
put
a
candidate
for
a
presidential
elector
on
the
ballot.
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
that
true
though?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
this
is
--
is
it
a
part
of
your
argument
really
that
this
requirement
doesn't
mean
much,
that
any
serious
candidate
can
get
it
anyway
and
that
this
is
just
an
afterthought?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
think
it
is
a
substantial
obstacle
to
an
independent
candidate?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
this
thing
is
kept
off
to
good
many
candidates
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
take
it
we
could
believe
then
it's
a
substantial
obstacle
in
what
you
say.
at
least
you
don't
say
it's
easy.
