mr.
john
j.
o'toole
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
outset,
i
would
like
to
thank
the
court
for
your
permission
in
granting
us
leave
to
present
two
counsels
and
i
would
like
to
further
elaborate
and
say
that
the
reason
we
did
so
request
even
though
the
rule
is
quite
clear
is
because
mr.
richard
friedman
has
been
working
very
closely
election
laws
for
many,
many
years
in
the
state
of
illinois
and
perhaps
his
presence
here
will
be
helpful
to
the
court.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
on
some
questions.
basically,
what
we
have
here
us
we
think
a
very
reasonable
and
workable
method
for
allowing
individuals
and
new
political
parties
to
gain
a
position
under
ballot
in
state
of
illinois
and
we
have
an
attack
made
upon
our
statutory
method
of
doing
so
based
upon
what
we
think
is
an
unwarranted
application
of
one
man,
one
vote.
essentially,
counsel
was
very
correct
in
that
although
this
case
merely
reflects
specifically
as
to
electors,
it
does
in
fact
our
entire
nominating
procedure
in
the
state
of
illinois.
as
mr.
justice
harlan
referred
to,
article
ii,
section
1,
clause
2
of
our
constitution
permits
those
state
legislatures
to
set
up
nominating
provisions
for
electors.
pursuant
to
that
grant
of
power
in
the
residual
powers
that
our
legislature
had,
we
have
set
up
a
system
whereby
any
existing
political
party
who
has
garnered
5%
of
the
vote
in
the
last
general
election
can
nominate
by
party
convention
its
electors
or
other
state
officials
to
be
elected.
we
also
have
a
provision
for
new
political
parties
to
gain
a
place
on
the
ballot,
not
on
the
primary
but
on
the
actual
ballot
by
obtaining
25,000
signatures,
200
of
which
must
be
from
at
least
50
different
counties,
approximately
50%
of
our
counties.
we
have
the
same
provision
for
individual
candidate
seeking
a
place
on
the
ballot
on
the
general
election,
not
on
a
primary
election.
in
macdougall
versus
green,
this
court
sanctioned
and
in
fact
approved
our
use
and
method
of
allowing
individuals
and
new
parties
to
gain
a
place
on
the
ballot
and
macdougall
versus
green
has
been
cited
since
its
decision
20
years
ago
mainly
for
the
proposition
that
it
was
the
first
case
which
said,
we,
the
federal
courts,
will
decide
these
political
issues
in
relation
to
elections
which
had
previously
not,
they
had
not
taken
jurisdiction
of,
mainly
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
could
the
people
of
cook
county
place
someone
on
the
ballot
for
a
statewide
election
under
our
present
election
code?
no.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
through
the
party?
no,
because
through
an
established
party,
the
established
party
can
only
place
an
individual
on
the
ballot
by
party
convention.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
and
a
party
convention.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
yes,
we
do.
we
have
a
cook
county
democratic
party,
cook
county
republican
party.
we
have
a
democratic
and
republican
party
in
each
of
the
101
other
counties.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
in
the
--
i
think
i'm
correct
on
this;
mr.
friedman
can
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong.
the
party
convention
is
made
up
of
a
representative
of
each
of
the
102
counties.
at
this
political
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
one
county
chairman.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
that's
101
counties.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
but
the
individual
delegation
from
a
county
and
might
be
more
than
one
here
carries
weighted
voting
depending
upon
the
amount
of
votes
that
that
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
i
would
eventually
say,
at
the
present
time,
yes
because
i
believe
more
than
half
of
the
democratic
votes
in
the
last
general
election
were
from
cook
county.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
a
democrat,
a
republican.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
yes.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
no,
no
not
on
the
primary
--
on
the
general.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
we
do
not
have
a
primary
if
there
are
no
contested
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
a
sure
majority.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
the
vote
to
one
has
the
majority.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
oh!
yes,
we
do
have
a
primary
in
illinois.
there
are
provisions
in
our
election
code
for
individuals
to
seek
an
office
within
a
political
party
by
nominating
petitions.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
but
what
we're
talking
about
here
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
the
party
itself
will
support
or
if
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
that's
right.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
there
are
provisions
in
our
election
code
which
permit
an
individual
to
obtain
a
place
on
a
party
ballot
in
a
primary
by
obtaining
a
requisite
amount
of
signatures.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
oh!
yes.
then
at
that
time,
there
would
be
an
election
as
a
matter
due
course,
we
do
have
primary
through
the
state
of
illinois
almost
all
the
time
because
of
the
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
there's
provision
that
he
has
to
do
it
by
nominating
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
i
think
that
in
the
independent,
i
don't
think
it's
quite
the
same.
it
is
based
upon
a
percentage
who
voted
in
the
prior
democratic
primary.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
he
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
i
don't
believe
there's
any
county
restriction
on
this
basis.
but
now
this
doesn't
affect
the
electors
that
we
have
here
because
the
electors
are
not
elected
out
of
a
primary.
those
are
chosen
solely
by
party
convention
in
cases
of
democratic
and
republican
party,
in
the
state
of
illinois.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
let's
say
that
due
to
practicalities
where
the
democratic
party
is
mainly
in
cook
county,
in
the
state
of
illinois
and
the
republican
party
is
mainly
in
downstate.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
that's
possible,
that's
right.
as
we
have
said
before,
counsel
has
based
this
entire
attack
of
unconstitutionality
thing
on
one
man,
one
vote.
now
actually,
one
man,
one
vote
doesn't
apply
here
for
two
reasons.
and
that
is
one,
we
don't
have
an
election.
we
fully
agree
that
if
there
were
an
elective
process,
one
man,
one
vote
would
apply.
but
that
would
only
be
where
we
have
representative
districts
or
legislature.
we
don't
have
that
in
this
situation.
what
we
have
done
here
is
our
legislature
has
determined
that
an
individual
seeking
statewide
office
or
federal
office
on
a
statewide
basis
should
demonstrate
at
least
the
minimal
requirements
of
statewide
support.
and
that
we
don't
believe
that
the
test
applied
to
our
statute
should
be
one
man,
one
vote
not
being
based
upon
representation
or
election.
but
rather
whether
we
have
created
a
situation
in
the
states
of
illinois
which
makes
it
practically
impossible
for
any
individual
or
new
political
party
to
gain
a
position
on
the
ballot
and
we
think
that
the
facts
will
not
bear
this
out.
in
rela
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
if
the
--
the
record
doesn't
really
reflect
your
honor
but
for
a
matter
of
what
i
was
told
that
there
were
supporters
of
senator
eugene
mccarthy.
but
that
was
only
hearsay.
i
have
nothing
of
basis
about
what
i
heard.
in
relation
to
the
question
propounded
by
mr.
justice
fortas
in
view
of
the
6.6
debasement
which
counsel
has
set
forth
as
being
the
basis
of
the
unconstitutionality
if
we
were
to
assume
that
one
man,
one
vote
applied
in
this
situation.
what
we
tried
to
say
was
this.
that
counsel
wants
us
to
take
off
the
200
votes
--
the
200
signatures
from
50
counties
and
just
leave
25,000
signatures
from
any
place
or
one
county.
we
can
go
into
counties
if
they
were
accomplished.
we
can
go
into
counties
in
a
corner
of
our
state
which
can
be
400
miles
away
from
any
other
portion
of
the
state,
from
cook
county
let's
say.
and
we
can
debase
of
vote
99.5%
of
those
living
in
the
other
counties
because
we
can
garner
one-half
of
1%
from
one
county
having
25,000
or
more
electors,
people
who
are
registered
to
vote.
and
we
suggest
that
that
in
view
of
the
dissent
in
macdougall
under
one
man,
one
vote
would
create
an
unconstitutional
situation
which
would
be
of
greater
significance
than
counsel
suggest
exists
now.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
well,
basically
their
argument
is
this,
that
people
living
in
50
counties
representing
6.6%
of
the
population
can
put
someone
on
the
ballot
who
is
not
acceptable
to
93.4%
of
the
people.
i
suggest
that
if
you
remove
the
requirement
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
in
relation
to
the
argument
of
the
state
from
that
point,
i
would
have
to
say
that
while
that
might
be
possible,
it
certainly
is
not
probable
that
an
individual
who
has
a
serious
candidate
could
not
garner
200
signatures
and
that
we
would
have
such
a
conspiracy
existing
in
53
counties
that
would
block
anyone
from
getting
on
a
ballot.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
that
is
part
of
it
but
then
you
got
it
transversely.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
basically
on
his
arguments
stated
on
the
converse
as
i
originally
stated
it,
that
93.4%
could
be
--
could
have
someone
on
the
ballot
that
was
not
acceptable
to
them
likewise
99.5%
could
have
someone
on
the
ballot
that
was
not
acceptable
to
them
if
this
were
removed.
but
we
think
we
have
reached
almost
an
optimum
in
allowing
an
individual
to
get
on
the
ballot
for
the
state
of
illinois.
and
i
would
like
to
leave
the
remaining
time
to
mr.
friedman
for
any
questions
you
might
have
concerning
particular
aspects
of
the
illinois
electoral
system.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
outset,
i
would
like
to
thank
the
court
for
your
permission
in
granting
us
leave
to
present
two
counsels
and
i
would
like
to
further
elaborate
and
say
that
the
reason
we
did
so
request
even

the

clear
is
because
mr.
richard

has
been
working
very
closely
election
laws
for
many,
many
years
in
the
state
of
illinois
and
perhaps
his
presence
here
will
be
helpful
to
the
court.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
on
some
questions.
basically,
what
we
have

us
we

yes,
we
do
have

in

there
are
provisions
in

election
code
for
individuals
to
seek
an
office
within
a

mr.

o'toole
but
what
we're
talking
about
here
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
the
party
itself
will
support
or
if
--
mr.
john

that's

yes.
then
at

we
do
have
primary
through
the

almost
all

because
of
the
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
there's
provision
that
he
has
to
do
it
by
nominating
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
i
think
that
in
the
independent,
i
don't
think
it's
quite
the
same.
it
is
based
upon
a

who
voted

primary.
mr.

he
--
mr.
john

o'toole
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
i
don't
believe
there's
any
county
restriction
on
this
basis.
but
now
this
doesn't
affect
the
electors
that
we
have
here
because
the
electors
are
not
elected
out
of
a
primary.
those
are
chosen
solely
by
party
convention
in
cases
of
democratic
and
republican
party,
in
the
state
of
illinois.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
let's
say
that
due
to
practicalities
where
the
democratic
party
is
mainly
in
cook
county,
in
the
state
of
illinois
and
the
republican
party
is
mainly
in
downstate.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
that's
possible,
that's
right.
as
we
have
said
before,
counsel
has
based
this
entire
attack
of
unconstitutionality
thing
on
one
man,
one
vote.
now
actually,
one
man,
one
vote
doesn't
apply
here
for
two
reasons.
and
that
is
one,
we
don't
have
an
election.
we
fully
agree
that
if
there
were
an
elective
process,
one
man,
one
vote
would
apply.
but
that
would
only
be
where
we
have
representative
districts
or
legislature.
we
don't
have
that
in
this
situation.
what
we
have
done
here
is
our
legislature
has
determined
that
an
individual
seeking
statewide
office
or
federal
office
on
a
statewide
basis
should
demonstrate
at
least
the
minimal
requirements
of
statewide
support.
and
that
we
don't
believe
that
the
test
applied
to
our
statute
should
be
one
man,
one
vote
not
being
based
upon
representation
or
election.
but
rather
whether
we
have
created
a
situation
in
the
states
of
illinois
which
makes
it
practically
impossible
for
any
individual
or
new
political
party
to
gain
a
position
on
the
ballot
and
we
think
that
the
facts
will
not
bear
this
out.
in
rela
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
if
the
--
the
record
doesn't
really
reflect
your
honor
but
for
a
matter
of
what
i
was
told
that
there
were
supporters
of
senator
eugene
mccarthy.
but
that
was
only
hearsay.
i
have
nothing
of
basis
about
what
i
heard.
in
relation
to
the
question
propounded
by
mr.
justice
fortas
in
view
of
the
6.6
debasement
which
counsel
has
set
forth
as
being
the
basis
of
the
unconstitutionality
if
we
were
to
assume
that
one
man,
one
vote
applied
in
this
situation.
what
we
tried
to
say
was
this.
that
counsel
wants
us
to
take
off
the
200
votes
--
the
200
signatures
from
50
counties
and
just
leave
25,000
signatures
from
any
place
or
one
county.
we
can
go
into
counties
if
they
were
accomplished.
we
can
go
into
counties
in
a
corner
of
our
state
which
can
be
400
miles
away
from
any
other
portion
of
the
state,
from
cook
county
let's
say.
and
we
can
debase
of
vote
99.5%
of
those
living
in
the
other
counties
because
we
can
garner
one-half
of
1%
from
one
county
having
25,000
or
more
electors,
people
who
are
registered
to
vote.
and
we
suggest
that
that
in
view
of
the
dissent
in
macdougall
under
one
man,
one
vote
would
create
an
unconstitutional
situation
which
would
be
of
greater
significance
than
counsel
suggest
exists
now.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
well,
basically
their
argument
is
this,
that
people
living
in
50
counties
representing
6.6%
of
the
population
can
put
someone
on
the
ballot
who
is
not
acceptable
to
93.4%
of
the
people.
i
suggest
that
if
you
remove
the
requirement
--
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
in
relation
to
the
argument
of
the
state
from
that
point,
i
would
have
to
say
that
while
that
might
be
possible,
it
certainly
is
not
probable
that
an
individual
who
has
a
serious
candidate
could
not
garner
200
signatures
and
that
we
would
have
such
a
conspiracy
existing
in
53
counties
that
would
block
anyone
from
getting
on
a
ballot.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
that
is
part
of
it
but
then
you
got
it
transversely.
mr.
john
j.
o'toole
basically
on
his
arguments
stated
on
the
converse
as
i
originally
stated
it,
that
93.4%
could
be
--
could
have
someone
on
the
ballot
that
was
not
acceptable
to
them
likewise
99.5%
could
have
someone
on
the
ballot
that
was
not
acceptable
to
them
if
this
were
removed.
but
we
think
we
have
reached
almost
an
optimum
in
allowing
an
individual
to
get
on
the
ballot
for
the
state
of
illinois.
and
i
would
like
to
leave
the
remaining
time
to
mr.
friedman
for
any
questions
you
might
have
concerning
particular
aspects
of
the
illinois
electoral
system.
