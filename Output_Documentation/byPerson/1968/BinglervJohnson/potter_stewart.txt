do
they
actually
move
to
the
campuses
of

the
university
of
pittsburgh
or
actually
these
are
local
universities,
i
suppose
they
continue
to
live
at
home,
do
they?
justice
potter
stewart
both
of
which
are
local?
justice
potter
stewart
and
i
understood
you
to
say
that
the
employer
company
paid
the
all
the
tuition
and
fees
and
that
you
concede.
you
can
say
that
that
was
not
taxable
income
(voice
overlap)?
justice
potter
stewart
was
this
--
as
i
understood
your
brief,
you
don't
make
any
real
distinction
between
or
at
least
you
don't
make
the
distinction
made
by
the
respondent
between
a
scholarship
and
a
fellowship.
justice
potter
stewart
well
the
scholarship
might
be
no
candidate
of
any
kind.
it
might
be
a
man
now
traveling
around
because
he
got
a
nice
type
hand
from
the
forth
foundation.
justice
potter
stewart
it
might
be
a
former
candidate
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
repeated
candidate.
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
that
perhaps
congress
meant
the
two
generically
to
be
different,
that
a
scholarship
was
something
that
was
given
to
somebody
who
was
in
school
at
any
level,
undergraduate
or
graduate
level,
or
even
high
school,
and
that
a
fellowship
grant,
a
fellowship
grant
was
and
could
be
given
to
somebody
not
--
not
could
immediate
people
--
might
or
might
not
be
an
academic
person
but
did
not
have
anything
to
do
with
school
as
such.
that's
the
respondent's
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
submission
as
i
understand
it.
justice
potter
stewart
as
i
looked
at
these
regulations,
they
do
seem
to
me,
superficially
at
least
to
make
very
close
to
this
distinction
made
by
the
respondent
for
whatever
its
worth,

says
scholarship
is
something
which
is
given
to
a
student,
whether
an
undergraduate
or
a
graduate,
and
dash,
and
fellowship,
a
fellowship
grant
generally
means
an
amount
paid
or
allowed
to
an
individual
to
aid
him
under
pursuit.
justice
potter
stewart
one
student
and
the
others
any
--
justice
potter
stewart
it
must
be
some
reason
for
the
difference
in
language.
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
any
limitation
on
the
amount
in
your
submission
that
could
be
exempt
from
tax
in
the
scholarship
under
--
if
a
person
is
working
toward
a
degree?
justice
potter
stewart
as
to
a
fellowship,
somebody
not
working
toward
a
degree?
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
so
this
could
be
a
$100,000.00
if
you
could
show
it.
justice
potter
stewart
but
so
far
as
the
statute
goes,
there's
no
limitation
on
all
amount,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
working
to
earn
a
degree?
justice
potter
stewart
as
i
understand
in
this
case,
the
employer
did
pay
the
actual
tuition
and
all
the
fees
and
so
on
of
the
educational
institution,
and
that
that's
not
an
issue
here
that
the
government
concedes,
that
part
is
not
income
to
your
clients.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it
has
been
made
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
government
put
it
in
terms
of
arguably,
it
could
be
included
in
income
of
your
clients
but
then,
it
would
be
a
deduction
for
you.
so,
it
would
washout,
it
would
be
a
deduction
then
if
it
would
be
your
client's
taxpayers.
justice
