mr.
james
c.
larrimer
may
it
please
the
court.
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
direct
my
initial
comments
to
the
question
which
was
told
by
mr.
justice
fortas
along
the
selection
of
the
thesis
topic.
the
selection
of
the
topic
itself
is
confined
to
the
area
in
which
the
scholarship
was
granted,
and
this
is
the
requirement
of
westinghouse
that
it
be
in
engineering
field.
that's
the
broad
limit
of
the
topic
itself.
the
selection
of
the
thesis
--
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
they
say
it
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
the
record
does
not
support
that.
the
record
--
the
testimony
of
the
witness
was
that
it
must
be
of
general
interest
and
very
general
in
nature,
i
think
for
the
exact
terms
that
were
used
by
the
witness.
the
thesis
topic
is
essentially
a
learning
process
or
a
teaching
process.
the
university
as
a
condition
of
granting
the
degree
of
a
doctor
of
philosophy
must
be
satisfied
that
these
men
have
the
ability
to
undertake
what
they
call
original
research.
they
must
first
select
the
topic,
and
in
selecting
the
topic,
they
must
make
a
search
of
the
records
in
order
to
ascertain
that
this
particular
topic
has
not
been
researched
before.
and
this
selection
must
be
made
and
submitted
to
the
faculty
and
the
university
for
approval.
and
after
the
selection
is
approved
as
constituting
original
research,
then
the
individual
student
is
permitted
to
pursue
his
research
in
order
to
secure
an
answer
to
the
problem
he
has
selected.
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
the
program,
yes
your
honor.
the
program
under
which
the
scholarship
is
granted
states
that
the
topic
should
be
of
interest
to
bettis
atomic
energy
and
it
should
be
submitted
to
them
for
approval.
so
that
they
do
have
--
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
it
would
not
be
approved
--
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
--
because
--
that's
true
your
honor.
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
well,
not
for
that
reason,
but
for
different
reason,
and
that
is
this,
that
when
these
individuals,
when
these
students
are
accepted
under
this
scholarship
program,
they
are
accepted
as
a
candidate
for
a
degree
in
the
department
of
engineering
and
science,
and
necessarily,
their
thesis
topic
must
be
involved
with
a
topic
which
is
in
that
department.
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
yes.
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
no,
the
program
does
not
say
that.
the
program
can
be
terminated
at
any
time
by
westinghouse
for
any
reason.
there's
no
vested
interest
in
the
student
and
continuation
of
the
program.
westinghouse
has
a
right
to
continue
or
to
discontinue
it
at
anytime
for
whatever
reason
they
choose,
but
the
testimony
of
the
--
in
that
court
below
was
that
it
had
to
be
an
engineering
and
it
could
be
a
very
general
nature
related
to
the
westinghouse
or
bettis
atomic
laboratory
which
of
course
was
involved
with
the
engineering
principles,
scientific
principles.
now,
the
government's
premise
which
is
stated
throughout
his
brief
and
stated
unequivocally
is
that
congress
plainly
intended
that
the
view
that
the
exclusion
would
not
apply
to
grants
that
our
in
affect
merely
famous
of
a
salary
during
a
period
or
the
recipient
is
on
leave
from
his
regular
job.
now,
this
statement
is
repeated
again
and
again.
as
repeated
again
on
page
9
of
their
brief,
has
repeated
again
on
page
12,
repeated
again
on
page
18,
on
page
21,
on
page
30,
and
on
page
4
and
8
of
the
reply
brief.
now,
i
suggest
to
this
court
that
the
statement
is
not
supported
by
the
legislative
history
and
directing
my
argument
to
that
aspect
of
it.
in
the
backdrop
of
this
case
--
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
very
well,
sir.
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
essentially
whether
or
not
an
employer
can
make
a
scholarship
grant
to
an
employee
with
that
scholarship
grant
being
excludable
from
gross
income
under
the
internal
revenue
code.
the
government's
position
is
that
it
cannot
because
congress
expressly
stated
that
any
continuing
salary
arrangement
was
not
to
have
attached
to
it
tax
exempt
consequences.
this
statement
on
behalf
of
the
government
is
repeated
throughout
its
brief
as
though
the
constant
repetition
would
add
some
validity
to
it.
the
legislative
history
however
does
not
support
the
statement
that
a
scholarship
which
may
in
fact
be
labeled
a
continuing
salary
arrangement.
the
legislative
history
does
not
support
that
statement.
the
1954
code
in
which
section
117
was
inserted
with
respect
to
scholarships
and
fellowships
was
new
with
the
1954
code.
there
was
no
specific
provision
of
the
internal
revenue
code
previous
to
that
time.
there
was
acknowledged
by
--
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
yes
sir.
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
there's
another
circuit,
i
think
it's
the
fourth
circuit
if
i'm
not
mistaken.
there
are
at
least
two
circuits
which
are
in
conflict
with
the
decision
of
the
third
circuit
in
this
case.
the
congress
at
the
time
of
enacting
the
section
117
recognized
the
state
of
confusion
which
existed
as
to
the
tax
consequences
of
the
scholarship
and
fellowship
grant.
it
said
about
to
attempt
to
provide
what
it
labeled
a
clear
cut
method
of
determining
the
tax
consequences
of
these
grants
without
the
necessity
of
deciding
each
case,
case-by-case.
it
did
so
under
the
format
of
section
117
in
which
it
set
forth
specifically
that
a
scholarship
at
an
educational
institution
shall
not
be
included
in
gross
income.
it
also
provided
that
a
fellowship
shall
not
be
included
in
gross
income.
and
then,
considering
the
compensatory
possibilities
of
these
grants,
it
inserted
limitations
in
the
code
in
section
117.
first,
it
provided
with
respect
to
scholarships
and
it's
recognized
by
congress
at
this
point
that
scholarships
must
be
at
an
educational
institution
as
it
is
defined
in
the
internal
revenue
code.
now,
the
internal
revenue
code
specifically
defines
an
educational
institution
as
an
education
--
as
an
institution
which
has
a
regular
faculty
and
a
regular
student
body
and
a
regular
curriculum.
so,
congress
intended
that
a
scholarship
relate
only
to
a
student
at
an
educational
institution.
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
the
student
is
on
a
leave
of
absence
from
a
company.
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
completely,
he's
got
no
duties
whatsoever.
he
does
not
report
to
the
company.
they
either
mail
to
him
his
monthly
stipend
or
it's
deposited
in
a
bank
to
his
account.
other
than
that,
he's
got
no
contact
whatsoever
with
the
employer.
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
he
has
no
contract
except
that
when
he
goes
on
this
educational
leave,
he
agrees
that
he
will
come
back
to
the
employer
for
a
period
of
at
least
two
years.
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
it
is
binding,
i
think
so,
yes
mr.
justice.
i
think
it's
binding,
but
i
don't
think
it's
enforceable
to
the
extent
of
requiring
him
to
come
back.
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
yes.
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
at
the
commensurate
salary
of
other
persons
with
his
qualifications.
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
the
record
in
this
case
establishes
that
they
receive
the
same
salary
when
they
returned
as
they
were
receiving
at
the
time
they
left.
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
pardon?
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
well,
they
are
classified.
they
have
various
classifications
of
engineers.
they
have
associate
engineer
and
a
junior
engineer
and
so
forth.
and
these
are
classifications
that
prevail
throughout
the
company.
and
when
they
reach,
when
they
are
elevated
into
another
classification,
this
is
dependent
on
merit.
and
when
they
reach
that
classification,
then
their
salary
is
adjusted
accordingly.
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
they
get
him
for
the
same
salary
that
he
was
receiving
at
the
time
he
left.
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
the
agreement
is
for
two
years.
but
that
doesn't
peg
a
salary.
the
salary
is
pegged
at
a
--
the
contract
provides
that
a
salary
will
be
commensurate
with
the
duties
--
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
will
be
commensurate
with
the
duties
assigned
to
him.
in
other
words,
if
he's
assigned
as
a
junior
engineer,
he'll
be
paid
as
a
junior
engineer.
if
he's
assigned
as
an
associate
engineer,
he'll
be
paid
at
that
rate.
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
well,
i'm
saying
the
record,
the
evidence
in
this
case
was
when
a
man
left,
he
came
back
at
that
same
grade
because
there
was
no
elevation
of
his
classification.
there
was
no
change
of
his
classification.
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
there
is
no
contractual
provision
as
to
how
long.
he
stays
in
a
certain
salary.
the
agreement
is
that
he'll
come
back
at
a
salary,
commensurate
with
the
duties
assigned.
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
right.
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
that's
right
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
as
a
matter
of
fact,
he
did,
but
that
was
--
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
that's
right.
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
mr.
chief
justice,
the
evidence
in
the
case
established
that
this
amount
of
money,
this
living
allowance
or
stipend
as
we
call
it
was
classified
under
accounting
records
as
indirect
labor.
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
as
indirect
labor.
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
and
the
company
withheld
income
tax
or
withholding
the
tax
from
this
stipend,
but
did
not
withhold
the
income
tax
from
the
tuition
that
was
paid
under
the
same
program.
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
well,
the
tuition
is
very
nominal
compared
to
the
living
allowance
paid.
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
that's
right.
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
my
opinion
is
that
a
company
can
have
a
scholarship
program
or
a
fellowship
program
and
deduct
the
cost
of
it
as
an
ordinary
and
necessary
business
expense.
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
there
is
no
clear
answer
to
that
except
to
the
extent
that
they
had
no
account
which
they
labeled
fellowships
and
scholarships.
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
i
don't
know
why
they
did
not
have,
except
perhaps
it
may
have
been
because
of
the
contractual
relationship
between
westinghouse
electric
corporation
and
the
atomic
energy
commission
because
these
men
were
employed
at
bettis
atomic
power
laboratory
which
was
a
government-owned
but
contractor-operated
plant.
this
means
that
the
government
owned
it
paid
for
all
the
expense
of
operation
but
it
was
operated
by
westinghouse.
and
perhaps
it
was
an
accounting
method
which
required
this
to
be
labeled
as
indirect
labor
because
--
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
essentially,
yes.
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
this
would
be
charged
to
the
atomic
energy
commission.
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
well,
i
don't
know
that
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
assuming
that
premise
is
correct
that
they
get
10%
of
whatever
they
spend,
and
that
would
be
true,
yes,
but
i'm
not
sure
that
that's
true
in
this
case
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
right.
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
now,
congress
established
the
tax
exempt
status
for
a
scholarship
and
an
educational
institution
and
a
fellowship.
it
then
inserted
the
limitations
considering
the
compensatory
aspect
of
these
two
grants.
with
respect
to
the
scholarship
and
an
educational
institution,
the
house
report
states
--
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
pardon?
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
considering
the
compensatory
aspect
of
the
grant
--
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
considering
--
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
--
that
there
maybe
a
compensatory
aspect
to
the
grants,
in
other
words,
previous
to
1954,
the
tax
consequence
of
a
scholarship
or
fellowship
grant
was
determined
by
where
not
it
was
gift
or
compensation.
and
you
have
to
eliminate
the
compensatory
--
in
order
to
have
a
scholarship
considered
tax
free,
you
have
to
eliminate
that
compensatory
aspect
of
it.
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
well,
they
couldn't
very
well
do
it.
there
was
only
one
case
which
held
that
a
fellowship
was
a
gift,
but
it's
difficult
in
my
way
of
thinking,
you
cannot
eliminate
that
compensatory
aspect
of
a
scholarship
or
fellowship
because
the
very
nature
of
the
grant
requires
you
to
render
services,
to
render
to
go
school,
and
the
fact
that
those
services
are
not
a
benefit
to
the
grantor
does
not
eliminate
that
compensatory
aspect
of
it.
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
he
can't
be
sued
mr.
justice,
but
i
doubt
that
if
there
any
damages.
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
because
he
is
not
--
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
essentially,
they
can
replace
him
with
another
employee.
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
at
the
same
salary,
they
have
other
employees
there.
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
if
they
can
establish
damages,
yes.he
would
be
liable
on
damages
for
not
returning.
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
the
basic
consideration
is
the
allowance
of
the
educational
leave
in
return
for
the
promise
to
come
back
to
the
employer.
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
for
that
salary
commenced
with
the
other
employees,
yes.
but
our
position
is
that
congress
specifically
provided
in
the
code
the
compensatory
aspect
of
a
scholarship,
once
it
is
determined
that
a
grant
is
made
for
the
education
of
an
individual,
if
it's
a
scholarship
at
an
education
institution,
there's
only
one
circumstance
in
which
a
part
of
it
is
taxable,
and
that
is
specifically
provided
under
section
117
and
a
limitation,
and
that
provision
is
that
if
he
is
required
to
render
services
in
a
nature
of
part-time
employment,
then
the
value
of
those
services
is
taxable
and
it's
only
the
balance
of
the
scholarship
which
is
tax
free.
and
there's
a
further
exception
on
that
as
if
those
services
which
are
required
to
be
rendered
are
services
which
are
required
as
part
of
the
curriculum
of
the
university
for
the
grant
of
the
degree,
then
even
they
do
not
result
in
taxable
income.
and
this
is
--
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
think
the
factual
circumstance
which
you've
set
forth
is
not
possible
under
the
--
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
have
to
know
one
more
fact,
and
that
is
whether
or
not
this
widget
that
this
man
is
working
on
is
required
research
or
investigation
as
part
of
the
curriculum
of
the
university
for
the
grant
of
the
degree.
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
yes.
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
i
would
have
to
say
then
that
if
it
is
not
part
of
the
curriculum
that
it
would
not
be
--
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
yes
(voice
overlap).
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
a
thesis
topic
and
the
dissertation
and
the
defense
of
it
is
part
of
the
curriculum.
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
and
it's
required
for
the
grant
of
the
degree
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
it
has
to
be
approved
and
has
to
be
required.
that
type
of
an
investigation
has
to
be
required
for
the
grant
of
a
degree.
if
it's
not
required
for
the
grant
of
a
degree,
then
a
service
is
rendered
and
it
would
not
qualify
as
a
scholarship
at
an
educational
institution.
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
the
best
response
i
can
make
to
this
your
honor
is
what
in
fact
occurred
in
this
case,
and
one
of
the
students
selected
a
thesis
topic
which
he
had
investigated
during
his
leave
of
absence.
it
was
a
--
of
course
in
an
engineering
field
which
would
have
been
a
value
to
engineering
generally,
but
after
studying
and
investigating
this
for
his
entire
leave
period,
he
gave
it
up
because
he
didn't
have
enough
time,
he
didn't
have
enough
equipment
to
really
arrive
in
an
answer
which
would
satisfy
the
requirements
that
the
university
for
the
thesis.
the
evidence
was
then
put
in
the
record
that
westinghouse
was
not
interested
in
this
particular
thesis
topic
to
the
extent
that
they
would
take
it
upon
themselves
to
pick
it
up
where
this
man
left
it
off
and
get
the
answer
to
it,
so
that
the
nature
of
the
thesis
topic
had
to
be
in
engineering
which
is
about
the
limit
of
the
value
of
a
specific
topic
to
westinghouse
itself.
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
the
answer
must
be
mr.
chief
justice
as
congress
felt
that
if
a
student
on
a
scholarship
in
an
educational
institution
was
pursuing
the
curriculum
under
or
required
by
that
university,
then
no
part
of
it
was
should
be
treated
as
compensation
and
taxable.
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
i
don't
think
there
has
to
be
a
correlation.
i
don't
think
because
deductible
by
a
company
it
must
be
taxable
to
the
recipient.
there
are
other
--
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
i
think
that
if
it's
in
fact
part-time
employment
that
and
it's
outside
the
curriculum
requirements
that
he
should
pay
tax.
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
you
mean
westinghouse
was
wrong?
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
yes,
i
think
they
did
it
out
of
an
abundance
of
caution
because
of
the
fact
that
there
are
other
sections
of
the
code
which
say
that
if
an
employer
does
not
withhold
tax,
and
may
i
answer
your
question,
there's
another
section
of
the
code
which
provides
a
different
employer
does
not
withhold
tax
from
something
which
is
taxable,
and
the
employee
who
receives
it
does
not
pay
tax
on
it,
then
both
the
employee
are
responsible,
both
the
employee
and
the
employer
are
responsible
for
the
same
tax.
so
out
of
an
abundance
of
caution,
the
employer
without
fail
usually
withholds
tax
unless
the
employee
litigate
the
tax
consequences
of
it.
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
no,
i
think
westinghouse
was
just
attempting
to
protect
itself.
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
well
--
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
well,
i
don't
--
i'm
not
sure
why
westinghouse
did
it
other
than
for
the
protective
feature
of
it.
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
there's
no
limitation
under
amount,
so
long
as
the
amount
is
initially
determined
to
be
a
scholarship,
amount
to
enable
the
student
to
pursue
his
education
at
a
--
in
institution.
there's
only
a
limitation
on
amount
as
to
a
fellowship.
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
right.
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
that's
right.
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
well,
i
think
there's
a
rule
or
reason
that
when
you
get
beyond.
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
there's
no
limitation
specifically
in
the
statute
on
amount
with
respect
to
the
scholarship.
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
working
to
earn
a
degree.
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
that
concession
was
not
made
until
this
time.
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
it
has
been
made
now
and
i
can't
see
the
significance
between
the
concession
on
the
tuition
and
a
concession
on
the
living
allowance
paid
under
the
program.
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
pardon?
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
i
think
so,
yes.
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
that's
right.
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
may
it
please
the
court.
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
direct
my
initial
comments
to
the
question
which
was
told
by
mr.
justice
fortas
along
the
selection
of
the
thesis
topic.
the
selection
of
the
topic
itself
is
confined
to
the
area
in
which
the
scholarship
was
granted,
and
this
is
the
requirement
of
westinghouse
that
it
be
in
engineering
field.
that's
the
broad
limit
of
the
topic
itself.
the
selection
of
the
thesis
--
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
they
say
it
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
the
record
does
not
support
that.
the
record
--
the
testimony
of
the
witness
was
that
it
must
be
of
general
interest
and
very
general
in
nature,
i
think
for
the
exact
terms
that
were
used
by
the
witness.
the
thesis
topic
is
essentially
a
learning
process
or
a
teaching
process.
the
university
as
a
condition
of
granting
the
degree
of
a
doctor
of
philosophy
must
be
satisfied
that
these
men
have
the
ability
to
undertake
what
they
call
original
research.
they
must
first
select
the
topic,
and
in
selecting
the
topic,
they
must
make
a
search
of
the
records
in
order
to
ascertain
that
this
particular
topic
has
not
been
researched
before.
and
this
selection
must
be
made
and
submitted
to
the
faculty
and
the
university
for
approval.
and
after
the
selection
is
approved
as
constituting
original
research,
then
the
individual
student
is
permitted
to
pursue
his
research
in
order
to
secure
an
answer
to
the
problem
he
has
selected.
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
the
program,
yes
your
honor.
the
program
under
which
the
scholarship
is
granted
states
that
the
topic
should
be
of
interest
to
bettis
atomic
energy
and
it
should
be
submitted
to
them
for
approval.
so
that
they
do
have
--
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
it
would
not
be
approved
--
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
--
because
--
that's
true
your
honor.
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
well,
not
for
that
reason,
but
for
different
reason,
and
that
is
this,
that
when
these
individuals,
when
these
students
are
accepted
under
this
scholarship
program,
they
are
accepted
as
a
candidate
for
a
degree
in
the
department
of
engineering
and
science,
and
necessarily,
their
thesis
topic
must
be
involved
with
a
topic
which
is
in
that
department.
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
yes.
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
no,
the
program
does
not
say
that.
the
program
can
be
terminated
at
any
time
by
westinghouse
for
any
reason.
there's
no
vested
interest
in
the
student
and
continuation
of
the
program.
westinghouse
has
a
right
to
continue
or
to
discontinue
it
at
anytime
for
whatever
reason
they
choose,
but
the
testimony
of
the
--
in
that
court
below
was
that
it
had
to
be
an
engineering
and
it
could
be
a
very
general
nature
related
to
the
westinghouse
or
bettis
atomic
laboratory
which
of
course
was
involved
with
the
engineering
principles,
scientific
principles.
now,
the
government's
premise
which
is
stated
throughout
his
brief
and
stated
unequivocally
is
that
congress
plainly
intended
that
the
view
that
the
exclusion
would
not
apply
to
grants
that
our
in
affect
merely
famous
of
a
salary
during
a
period
or
the
recipient
is
on
leave
from
his
regular
job.
now,
this
statement
is
repeated
again
and
again.
as
repeated
again
on
page
9
of
their
brief,
has
repeated
again
on
page
12,
repeated
again
on
page
18,
on
page
21,
on
page
30,
and
on
page
4
and
8
of
the
reply
brief.
now,
i
suggest
to
this
court
that
the
statement
is
not
supported
by
the
legislative
history
and
directing
my
argument
to
that
aspect
of
it.
in
the
backdrop
of
this
case
--
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
very
well,
sir.
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
essentially
whether
or
not
an
employer
can
make
a
scholarship
grant
to
an
employee
with
that
scholarship
grant
being
excludable
from
gross
income
under
the
internal
revenue
code.
the
government's
position
is
that
it
cannot
because
congress
expressly
stated
that
any
continuing
salary
arrangement
was
not
to
have
attached
to
it
tax
exempt
consequences.
this
statement
on
behalf
of
the
government
is
repeated
throughout
its
brief
as
though
the
constant
repetition
would
add
some
validity
to
it.
the
legislative
history
however
does
not
support
the
statement
that
a
scholarship
which
may
in
fact
be
labeled
a
continuing
salary
arrangement.
the
legislative
history
does
not
support
that
statement.
the
1954
code
in
which
section
117
was
inserted
with
respect
to
scholarships
and
fellowships
was
new
with
the
1954
code.
there
was
no
specific
provision
of
the
internal
revenue
code
previous
to
that
time.
there
was
acknowledged
by
--
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
yes
sir.
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
there's
another
circuit,
i
think
it's
the
fourth
circuit
if
i'm
not
mistaken.
there
are
at
least
two
circuits
which
are
in
conflict
with
the
decision
of
the
third
circuit
in
this
case.
the
congress
at
the
time
of
enacting
the
section
117
recognized
the
state
of
confusion
which
existed
as
to
the
tax
consequences
of
the
scholarship
and
fellowship
grant.
it
said
about
to
attempt
to
provide
what
it
labeled
a
clear
cut
method
of
determining
the
tax
consequences
of
these
grants
without
the
necessity
of
deciding
each
case,
case-by-case.
it
did
so
under
the
format
of
section
117
in
which
it
set
forth
specifically
that
a
scholarship
at
an
educational
institution
shall
not
be
included
in
gross
income.
it
also
provided
that
a
fellowship
shall
not
be
included
in
gross
income.
and
then,
considering
the
compensatory
possibilities
of
these
grants,
it
inserted
limitations
in
the
code
in
section
117.
first,
it
provided
with
respect
to
scholarships
and
it's
recognized
by
congress
at
this
point
that
scholarships
must
be
at
an
educational
institution
as
it
is
defined
in
the
internal
revenue
code.
now,
the
internal
revenue
code
specifically
defines
an
educational
institution
as
an
education
--
as
an
institution
which
has
a
regular
faculty
and
a
regular
student
body
and
a
regular
curriculum.
so,
congress
intended
that
a
scholarship
relate
only
to
a
student
at
an
educational
institution.
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
the
student
is
on
a
leave
of
absence
from
a
company.
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
completely,
he's
got
no
duties
whatsoever.
he
does
not
report
to
the
company.
they
either
mail
to
him
his
monthly
stipend
or
it's
deposited
in
a
bank
to
his
account.
other
than
that,
he's
got
no
contact
whatsoever
with
the
employer.
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
he
has
no
contract
except
that
when
he
goes
on
this
educational
leave,
he
agrees
that
he
will
come
back
to
the
employer
for
a
period
of
at
least
two
years.
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
it
is
binding,
i
think
so,
yes
mr.
justice.
i
think
it's
binding,
but
i
don't
think
it's
enforceable
to
the
extent
of
requiring
him
to
come
back.
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
yes.
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
at
the
commensurate
salary
of
other
persons
with
his
qualifications.
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
the
record
in
this
case
establishes
that
they
receive
the
same
salary
when
they
returned
as
they
were
receiving
at
the
time
they
left.
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
pardon?
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
well,
they
are
classified.
they
have
various
classifications
of
engineers.
they
have
associate
engineer
and
a
junior
engineer
and
so
forth.
and
these
are
classifications
that
prevail
throughout
the
company.
and
when
they
reach,
when
they
are
elevated
into
another
classification,
this
is
dependent
on
merit.
and
when
they
reach
that
classification,
then
their
salary
is
adjusted
accordingly.
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
they
get
him
for
the
same
salary
that
he
was
receiving
at
the
time
he
left.
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
the
agreement
is
for
two
years.
but
that
doesn't
peg
a
salary.
the
salary
is
pegged
at
a
--
the
contract
provides
that
a
salary
will
be
commensurate
with
the
duties
--
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
will
be
commensurate
with
the
duties
assigned
to
him.
in
other
words,
if
he's
assigned
as
a
junior
engineer,
he'll
be
paid
as
a
junior
engineer.
if
he's
assigned
as
an
associate
engineer,
he'll
be
paid
at
that
rate.
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
well,
i'm
saying
the
record,
the
evidence
in
this
case
was
when
a
man
left,
he
came
back
at
that
same
grade
because
there
was
no
elevation
of
his
classification.
there
was
no
change
of
his
classification.
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
there
is
no
contractual
provision
as
to
how
long.
he
stays
in
a
certain
salary.
the
agreement
is
that
he'll
come
back
at
a
salary,
commensurate
with
the
duties
assigned.
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
right.
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
that's
right
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
as
a
matter
of
fact,
he
did,
but
that
was
--
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
that's
right.
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
mr.
chief
justice,
the
evidence
in
the
case
established
that
this
amount
of
money,
this
living
allowance
or
stipend
as
we
call
it
was
classified
under
accounting
records
as
indirect
labor.
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
as
indirect
labor.
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
and
the
company
withheld
income
tax
or
withholding
the
tax
from
this
stipend,
but
did
not
withhold
the
income
tax
from
the
tuition
that
was
paid
under
the
same
program.
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
well,
the
tuition
is
very
nominal
compared
to
the
living
allowance
paid.
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
that's
right.
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
my
opinion
is
that
a
company
can
have
a
scholarship
program
or
a
fellowship
program
and
deduct
the
cost
of
it
as
an
ordinary
and
necessary
business
expense.
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
there
is
no
clear
answer
to
that
except
to
the
extent
that
they
had
no
account
which
they
labeled
fellowships
and
scholarships.
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
i
don't
know
why
they
did
not
have,
except
perhaps
it
may
have
been
because
of
the
contractual
relationship
between
westinghouse
electric
corporation
and
the
atomic
energy
commission
because
these
men
were
employed
at
bettis
atomic
power
laboratory
which
was
a
government-owned
but
contractor-operated
plant.
this
means
that
the
government
owned
it
paid
for
all
the
expense
of
operation
but
it
was
operated
by
westinghouse.
and
perhaps
it
was
an
accounting
method
which
required
this
to
be
labeled
as
indirect
labor
because
--
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
essentially,
yes.
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
this
would
be
charged
to
the
atomic
energy
commission.
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
well,
i
don't
know
that
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
assuming
that
premise
is
correct
that
they
get
10%
of
whatever
they
spend,
and
that
would
be
true,
yes,
but
i'm
not
sure
that
that's
true
in
this
case
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
right.
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
now,
congress
established
the
tax
exempt
status
for
a
scholarship
and
an
educational
institution
and
a
fellowship.
it
then
inserted
the
limitations
considering
the
compensatory
aspect
of
these
two
grants.
with
respect
to
the
scholarship
and
an
educational
institution,
the
house
report
states
--
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
pardon?
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
considering
the
compensatory
aspect
of
the
grant
--
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
considering
--
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
--
that
there
maybe
a
compensatory
aspect
to
the
grants,
in
other
words,
previous
to
1954,
the
tax
consequence
of
a
scholarship
or
fellowship
grant
was
determined
by
where
not
it
was
gift
or
compensation.
and
you
have
to
eliminate
the
compensatory
--
in
order
to
have
a
scholarship
considered
tax
free,
you
have
to
eliminate
that
compensatory
aspect
of
it.
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
well,
they
couldn't
very
well
do
it.
there
was
only
one
case
which
held
that
a
fellowship
was
a
gift,
but
it's
difficult
in
my
way
of
thinking,
you
cannot
eliminate
that
compensatory
aspect
of
a
scholarship
or
fellowship
because
the
very
nature
of
the
grant
requires
you
to
render
services,
to
render
to
go
school,
and
the
fact
that
those
services
are
not
a
benefit
to
the
grantor
does
not
eliminate
that
compensatory
aspect
of
it.
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
he
can't
be
sued
mr.
justice,
but
i
doubt
that
if
there
any
damages.
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
because
he
is
not
--
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
essentially,
they
can
replace
him
with
another
employee.
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
at
the
same
salary,
they
have
other
employees
there.
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
if
they
can
establish
damages,
yes.he
would
be
liable
on
damages
for
not
returning.
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
the
basic
consideration
is
the
allowance
of
the
educational
leave
in
return
for
the
promise
to
come
back
to
the
employer.
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
for
that
salary
commenced
with
the
other
employees,
yes.
but
our
position
is
that
congress
specifically
provided
in
the
code
the
compensatory
aspect
of
a
scholarship,
once
it
is
determined
that
a
grant
is
made
for
the
education
of
an
individual,
if
it's
a
scholarship
at
an
education
institution,
there's
only
one
circumstance
in
which
a
part
of
it
is
taxable,
and
that
is
specifically
provided
under
section
117
and
a
limitation,
and
that
provision
is
that
if
he
is
required
to
render
services
in
a
nature
of
part-time
employment,
then
the
value
of
those
services
is
taxable
and
it's
only
the
balance
of
the
scholarship
which
is
tax
free.
and
there's
a
further
exception
on
that
as
if
those
services
which
are
required
to
be
rendered
are
services
which
are
required
as
part
of
the
curriculum
of
the
university
for
the
grant
of
the
degree,
then
even
they
do
not
result
in
taxable
income.
and
this
is
--
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
think
the
factual
circumstance
which
you've
set
forth
is
not
possible
under
the
--
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
have
to
know
one
more
fact,
and
that
is
whether
or
not
this
widget
that
this
man
is
working
on
is
required
research
or
investigation
as
part
of
the
curriculum
of
the
university
for
the
grant
of
the
degree.
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
yes.
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
i
would
have
to
say
then
that
if
it
is
not
part
of
the
curriculum
that
it
would
not
be
--
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
yes
(voice
overlap).
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
a
thesis
topic
and
the
dissertation
and
the
defense
of
it
is
part
of
the
curriculum.
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
and
it's
required
for
the
grant
of
the
degree
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
it
has
to
be
approved
and
has
to
be
required.
that
type
of
an
investigation
has
to
be
required
for
the
grant
of
a
degree.
if
it's
not
required
for
the
grant
of
a
degree,
then
a
service
is
rendered
and
it
would
not
qualify
as
a
scholarship
at
an
educational
institution.
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
the
best
response
i
can
make
to
this
your
honor
is
what
in
fact
occurred
in
this
case,
and
one
of
the
students
selected
a
thesis
topic
which
he
had
investigated
during
his
leave
of
absence.
it
was
a
--
of
course
in
an
engineering
field
which
would
have
been
a
value
to
engineering
generally,
but
after
studying
and
investigating
this
for
his
entire
leave
period,
he
gave
it
up
because
he
didn't
have
enough
time,
he
didn't
have
enough
equipment
to
really
arrive
in
an
answer
which
would
satisfy
the
requirements
that
the
university
for
the
thesis.
the
evidence
was
then
put
in
the
record
that
westinghouse
was
not
interested
in
this
particular
thesis
topic
to
the
extent
that
they
would
take
it
upon
themselves
to
pick
it
up
where
this
man
left
it
off
and
get
the
answer
to
it,
so
that
the
nature
of
the
thesis
topic
had
to
be
in
engineering
which
is
about
the
limit
of
the
value
of
a
specific
topic
to
westinghouse
itself.
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
the
answer
must
be
mr.
chief
justice
as
congress
felt
that
if
a
student
on
a
scholarship
in
an
educational
institution
was
pursuing
the
curriculum
under
or
required
by
that
university,
then
no
part
of
it
was
should
be
treated
as
compensation
and
taxable.
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
i
don't
think
there
has
to
be
a
correlation.
i
don't
think
because
deductible
by
a
company
it
must
be
taxable
to
the
recipient.
there
are
other
--
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
i
think
that
if
it's
in
fact
part-time
employment
that
and
it's
outside
the
curriculum
requirements
that
he
should
pay
tax.
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
you
mean
westinghouse
was
wrong?
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
yes,
i
think
they
did
it
out
of
an
abundance
of
caution
because
of
the
fact
that
there
are
other
sections
of
the
code
which
say
that
if
an
employer
does
not
withhold
tax,
and
may
i
answer
your
question,
there's
another
section
of
the
code
which
provides
a
different
employer
does
not
withhold
tax
from
something
which
is
taxable,
and
the
employee
who
receives
it
does
not
pay
tax
on
it,
then
both
the
employee
are
responsible,
both
the
employee
and
the
employer
are
responsible
for
the
same
tax.
so
out
of
an
abundance
of
caution,
the
employer
without
fail
usually
withholds
tax
unless
the
employee
litigate
the
tax
consequences
of
it.
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
no,
i
think
westinghouse
was
just
attempting
to
protect
itself.
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
well
--
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
well,
i
don't
--
i'm
not
sure
why
westinghouse
did
it
other
than
for
the
protective
feature
of
it.
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
there's
no
limitation
under
amount,
so
long
as
the
amount
is
initially
determined
to
be
a
scholarship,
amount
to
enable
the
student
to
pursue
his
education
at
a
--
in
institution.
there's
only
a
limitation
on
amount
as
to
a
fellowship.
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
right.
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
that's
right.
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
well,
i
think
there's
a
rule
or
reason
that
when
you
get
beyond.
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
there's
no
limitation
specifically
in
the
statute
on
amount
with
respect
to
the
scholarship.
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
working
to
earn
a
degree.
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
that
concession
was
not
made
until
this
time.
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
it
has
been
made
now
and
i
can't
see
the
significance
between
the
concession
on
the
tuition
and
a
concession
on
the
living
allowance
paid
under
the
program.
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
pardon?
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
i
think
so,
yes.
mr.
james
c.
larrimer
that's
right.
