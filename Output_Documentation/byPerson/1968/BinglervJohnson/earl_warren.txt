mr.

chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
the
company
does
have
the
right
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
proposal
of
the
employee
for
a
thesis
is
to
be
permitted.
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
other
words,
he
isn't
entirely
a
free
agent
to
acquire
a
doctorate
without
regard
to
his
work.
suppose
from
atomic
energy,
he
wanted
to
write
a
thesis
on
english.
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
not
be
approved
at
all?
chief
justice
earl
warren
because
there
is
no
specific
interest
to
the
company
in
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
does
that
interest
only
as
general
as
science,
anything
in
science
whether
it
reflect
to
do
work
or
not
would
be
approve?
chief
justice
earl
warren
of
necessity,
they
have
to
approve
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
let
you
start
that
in
the
morning.
we'll
recess
now
mr.

473,
john

director

petitioner
versus
richard
e.johnson
et
al.
mr.
larrimer,
you
may
continue
with
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
at
the
salaries
that
are
being
paid
at
the
time
he
comes
back.
chief
justice
earl
warren
not
at
the
time
that
he
leaves?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought
you'd
said
the
opposite
to
justice
black.
i
thought
you
said
that
he
came
back
at
the
pay
that
he
left
with.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
but
he
came
back
with
all
seniority
rights,
didn't
he?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
that
would
entitle
him
to
whatever
pay
was
being
made
for
people
in
his
grade
at
the
time
he
comes
back.
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
you
how
did
the
company
treat
this
expenditure
tax-wise?
chief
justice
earl
warren
as
indirect
labor.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
does
that
breakdown
in
dollars?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
most
of
it,
they
counted
as
a
business
expense?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
they
counted
that
his
service
during
the
interim
as
indirect
labor
so
they
could
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
they
haven't
called
it
indirect
labor,
could
they
have
done
that?
could
they
have
taken
a
deduction
for
that?
would
it
have
been
(voice
overlap).
chief
justice
earl
warren
even
if
they
call
indirect
labor
then?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
shouldn't
they
if
that
was
an
exempt
expenditure?
chief
justice
earl
warren
westinghouse
was
on
the
cost-plus
basis?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
then
they
took
the
deduction
for
this.
chief
justice
earl
warren
so,
they
actually
--
they
actually
got
from
the
government
10%
more
than
they
put
out
for
this?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
why
wouldn't
they
if
it's
an
operating
expense
and
they're
entitled
to
cost
plus
--
why
wouldn't
they
get
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
might
not
be
the
exact
percentage,
that's
what
you
mean.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
you
this.
this
is
what's
bothering
me.
if
it
is
--
this
is
justified
as
a
business
expense
on
the
basis
that
it
is
part-time
employment,
why
shouldn't
there
be
some
pro
tanto
recognition
of
the
part
that
is
employment
and
the
part
that
is
not
employment
when
the
tax
returns
are
made?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
might
it
not
be
one
thing
that
a
company
just
out
of
a
goodness
of
his
heart
gave
this
stipend
to
a
man
for
this
particular
period
and
did
not
considered
it
as
business
expense
in
this
operation
from.
on
the
other
hand
treating
it
as
a
business
expense
and
justifying
it
because
it
was
part-time
employment.
chief
justice
earl
warren
don't
you
think
one
of
them
should
at
least
pay
something
by
reason
of
it
being
part-time
employment?
do
you
think
if
it's
part-time
employment
that
the
company
should
take
all
of
it
as
tax
deduction
or
if
it
--
if
employees
being
paid
partially
for
the
work
he
does
for
the
company
that
he
shouldn't
pay
some
income
tax?
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
say
then
that
they
were
wrong
in
calling
this
part-time
employment?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
does
that
mean
that
westinghouse
wanted
to
hid
this
case
and
keep
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
in
that
respect,
in
that
respect
so
it
could
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
could
the
--
could
consider
it
as
a
business
expense.
