it
clearly
understood
that
they
will
approve
his
dissertation
subject
only
if
it

i

your

that.

may
i

may
i
take

take
it

not

that
the

is
a
topic
that
is
of

interest
to

official
interest
to
a.e.c.
in

let's

excuse
me,

on

of

this
is
what

my

you
say
each

must
be
approved
then
the
topic
of
his
proposed

it
is
reviewed
to
ensure
that
it
is
relevant
to
the
work
program
of
the

relevant
to
the
work
program
of
the
laboratory.
justice
abe
fortas
may
i
ask
you
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
this
question?
suppose
an
employee
of
westinghouse
went
to
his
superiors
and
he
said,
“i
want
to
take
a
year
off
to
work
on
my
doctoral
thesis.”
and
they
said,
“well,
that's
fine.
westinghouse
likes
to
encourage
its
young
people
and
we'll
give
you
scholarship,
let's
say
$10,000.00.”
and
so,
they
just
give
him
$10,000.00,
nothing
more,
those
are
the
total
facts.
how
would
that
be
treated?
justice
abe
fortas
no
quid
pro
quo.
justice
abe
fortas
no.
justice
abe
fortas
no,
westinghouse
says
we
--
justice
abe
fortas
(voice
overlap)
thing
we'd
give
you
a
scholarship
of
$10,000.00.
justice
abe
fortas
but
really
what
you
settle
down
to
hear
are
the
--
is
the
intimate
time
between
the
terms
and
conditions
of
employment
in
westinghouse
business
interest
and
the
payments
made
here
on
the
one
hand
and
the
time
between
the
payments
made
here
and
the
usual
or
ordinary
compensation
or
the
personal
on
the
other.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
the
government
says
some
quite
a
lot
more
specific
than
that,
the
government
says
something
much
more
specific
than
that.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
haven't
got
a
chance
to
check
into
the
record,
but
the
government
says
it's
got
to
be
connected
with
the
--
it
has
to
be
relevant
to
the
work
program
of
the
laboratory,
and
do
you
say
the
record
does
not
support
that?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
take
the
other
way,
take
the
other
way
around
suppose
the
westinghouse
and
the
a.e.c.
said
to
one
of
its
employees
you
go
to
the
university,
you're
now
engage
fulltime
with
us
on
the
development
of
something
rather
than
widget,
let's
say.
if
you
go
to
the
university
and
you
spend
all
of
your
time
now
on
that
same
project
than
development
of
the
widget
and
we'll
give
you
what
we
call
a
scholarship
or
a
fellowship
90%
of
your
prior
salary.
now,
is
that
payment
for
services
that
he's
received
payment
for
services
to
westinghouse
and
a.e.c.,
is
it
taxable,
or
is
it
within
the
statutory
provision
for
deduction?
justice
abe
fortas
or
is
it
possible,
i
just
imagine
that,
and
i
put
it
to
you
because
it
hope
that
it
may
serve
to
dramatize
or
to
me
is
one
of
the
basic
problems
in
this
case
and
that
is
to
some
extent
here,
to
some
extent
westinghouse
and
the
a.e.c.
are
keeping
control
over
what
this
employee
does
to
some
extent
what
the
employee
does
at
the
university
is
a
thing
of
value
to
westinghouse
and
the
a.e.c.
and
i'm
asking
you
to
assume
a
case
where
that
is
crystal
clear
and
dramatic,
namely
where
the
employee
does
at
the
university
precisely
what
he
would
be
doing
if
he
weren't
in
the
university
and
were
working
on
the
plain?
justice
abe
fortas
i
don't
know
what
you
mean
by
required
research.
i
suppose
that
most
of
these
people
are
working
in
areas
where
they
have
a
wide
choice
as
to
the
subject
of
their
thesis.
your
clients
were
all
working
on
thesis,
weren't
they?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
they
have
wide
choices
to
that
and
it's
permitted
who
by
the
university
just
as
it
was
in
your
case,
so
i
won't
give
you
that
fact.
justice
abe
fortas
is
a
doctor's
dissertation
part
of
the
curriculum?
justice
abe
fortas
it
felt
that
it
was
a
whole
spectrum
of
knowledge
and
selects
from
it
something
of
particular
interest
to
him,
is
that
part
of
the
curriculum?
justice
abe
fortas
alright.
justice
abe
fortas
if
that's
what
you're
talking
if
you're
using
curriculum
in
that
sense
that
the
topic
of
the
dissertation
is
approve,
of
course
it
has
to
be
approved
by
the
university
authorities.
does
that
make
any
difference?
justice
abe
fortas
well
obviously,
in
some
relationship
between
that
and
this
situation
in
which
i
understand
it,
the
dissertation
has
to
be
in
some
measure
to
some
degree
relating
to
the
work
of
the
laboratory.
in
any
event,
and
there's
a
dispute
between
you
and
the
government
as
to
precisely
what
the
record
shows
on
that.
in
any
event,
the
dissertation
subject
has
to
be
approved
by
westinghouse
or
the
a.e.c.
or
both
of
them.
and
so
that
there
are
some
major
of
service.
i
should
arguably
in

way
arguably
either
some
measure
of
service
being
rendered
by
