mr.
harris
weinstein
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
federal
income
tax
case
comes
to
this
court
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit.
the
issue
involves
the
meaning
of
the
words
scholarship
and
fellowship
grant
which
are
used
in
section
117
of
the
internal
revenue
code
of
1954.
that
section
of
the
code
allows
the
recipient
to
exclude
the
amount
of
scholarships
or
fellowships
from
his
gross
income.
that
is
it
makes
scholarships
and
fellowships
tax
exempt.
this
case
typifies
a
tax
problem
that
seems
to
have
arisen
since
the
1954
code
was
adopted.
at
least,
congress
in
writing
section
117
in
the
legislative
history
showed
no
then
awareness
of
this
type
of
problem.
it
is
basically
this.
it
goes
to
the
meaning
of
the
words
scholarship
and
fellowship
in
a
commercial
setting.
do
those
words
encompass
the
situation
where
an
employer
gives
his
employee
leave
from
his
regular
duties
and
continues
the
employee's
regular
salary
or
the
greater
part
of
it
while
the
employee
is
taking
a
graduate
degree
on
the
subject
matter
of
his
employment,
and
at
the
same
time,
the
employer
obligates
the
employee
to
return
to
work
for
some
specified
minimum
period
of
time.
the
issue
comes
to
the
court
because
of
a
split
of
authority
among
the
lower
federal
courts.
the
fifth
and
sixth
circuits
and
the
court
of
claims
have
each
sustained
treasury
regulations
tending
to
the
view
that
payments
made
in
this
type
of
commercial
setting
are
not
scholarships
or
fellowships.
the
third
circuit
in
this
case
has
rejected
those
regulations
has
ruled
that
these
payments
are
scholarship
or
fellowship
and
has
reversed
a
jury
verdict
in
favor
of
the
united
states.
the
precise
problem
comes
out
at
payments
that
the
westinghouse
electric
corporation
made
to
the
three
respondents
before
this
court
at
a
time
when
those
respondents
were
on
leave,
working
on
doctoral
dissertations.
these
amounts
were
paid
pursuant
to
program
available
to
engineers
and
scientists
employed
at
the
bettis
atomic
power
laboratory
at
pittsburg,
pennsylvania.
that
is
a
laboratory
owned
by
the
atomic
energy
commission
and
most
if
not
all
of
its
activities
seemed
to
be
in
the
design
of
nuclear
reactors
for
producing
electric
power.
westinghouse
operates
the
laboratory
under
cost-plus
contract
with
the
atomic
energy
commission.
in
this
particular
program
that
we're
concern
with
here,
and
i
think
it's
typical
of
similar
programs,
is
intended
as
a
testimony
here
shows
to
meet
the
needs
that
westinghouse
and
the
a.e.c.
have
for
highly
trained
technical
people
to
help
them
recruit
these
people
to
keep
them
over
a
long
period
of
time
and
to
keep
them
up
to
date
on
technical
requirements
of
their
job.
the
program
that
we're
concerned
with
is
broken
into
two
phases.
the
first
one
which
is
called
the
work-study
phase
has
not
given
rise
to
any
tax
dispute,
at
least
up
to
now.
at
last
for
four
years
and
it
begins
when
the
employee
is
accepted
by
westinghouse
into
this
bettis
program.
in
the
case
of
two
of
the
respondents,
that
occurred
when
they
agreed
to
work
for
westinghouse
with
the
third
respondent
that
occurred
sometime
after
he
had
come
to
work
for
westinghouse.
during
this
four-year
work-study
phase,
the
employee
holds
down
a
regular
job
at
the
bettis
laboratory
and
he
attends
classes
part-time
at
either
the
university
of
pittsburg
or
the
carnegie
institute
of
technology,
which
i
think
since
the
events
in
this
case,
has
become
the
carnegie-mellon
university.
westinghouse
pays
the
employee
for
40
hours
a
week,
but
allows
him
eight
hours
weekly
up
to
i
think
a
total
of
156
hours
each
year
to
go
to
class.
westinghouse
pays
his
tuition
fees
during
that
period.
at
the
end
of
this
four-year
period,
employees
are
supposed
to
have
met
his
preliminary
requirements
for
the
doctoral
degree
in
engineering
or
science.
when
all
his
course
work,
his
language
studies
are
finished
and
he's
pass
the
qualification
examinations
for
the
doctoral
degree,
he
applies
for
a
leave
of
absence
to
work
on
his
dissertation.
he
receives
a
leave
of
absence
if
westinghouse
and
the
a.e.c.
each
approve
the
applicant,
not
all
are
approved,
and
if
westinghouse
and
the
a.e.c.
each
approve
his
thesis
topic
which
in
the
first
instance
approved
by
the
university.
if
he
is
granted
leave,
he
then
agrees
to
come
back
to
westinghouse
for
some
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
believe
justice
fortas
that
the
testimony
which
is
our
call
on
this
topic
was
of
a
representative
of
the
a.e.c.
was
that
they
wanted
the
topic
to
be
work
connected.
now,
i
think
that
has
a
broad
scope
and
it
certainly
does
not
mean
a
topic
of
current
use
or
of
current
concern
to
the
laboratory,
but
i
would
suppose
that
it
rather
means
a
topic
that
by
its
nature
helps
the
man
learn
better
how
to
work
on
the
problems
at
the
laboratory.
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
think
justice
fortas,
i'll
go
too
far
if
i
said
that
it
was
of
immediate
commercial
value
at
the
time
that
is
was
performed.
it
may
or
may
not
be,
and
i
think
that
work
connected
was
used
in
the
somewhat
more
general
sense.
of
the
topics
here
were
chosen
by
in
this
case
were
chosen
by
the
respondents.
they
were
generally
related
to
the
area
of
interest
which
i
think
were
the
areas
were
the
respondents
had
worked
generally
speaking
before
taking
their
leave.
the
topics
were
approved
by
the
a.e.c.
and
westinghouse.
there
is
apparently
precedent
for
disapproval
but
it
did
not
happened
with
any
of
these
three
respondents.
now
in
return
for
the
this
leave,
the
respondent
agrees
to
return
for
a
--
to
westinghouse
at
that
is
for
a
minimum
period
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
think
justice
fortas
that
if
there
is
a
vagueness
there;
it
is
a
vagueness
that
reflects
the
record.
this
record
did
not
involve
any
topics
that
had
been
disapproved,
denied
beyond
inquiring
whether
there
was
approved
or
whether
there
had
ever
been
any
instances
of
disapproval.
i
do
not
believe
there
was
any
inquiry
into
what
might
leave
the
a.e.c.
and
westinghouse
to
disapprove
a
particular
contract.
and
i
don't
want
to
suggest
that
the
topics
were
viewed
for
immediate
commercial
benefit
at
that
point.
this
minimum
period
of
obligation
after
the
leave
was
in
the
case
of
two
respondents
here,
two
years,
and
the
case
of
the
third,
who
came
under
an
earlier
version
of
the
same
program,
he
was
committed
to
return
to
westinghouse
for
one
year
after
his
leave.
during
the
leave,
westinghouse
pays
all
tuition
and
fees,
and
those
amounts
are
not
in
dispute
here.
they
have
not
been
taxed
and
there
is
no
contention
that
they
should
be
taxed.
the
dispute
goes
to
an
amount
that
is
paid
calculated
on
the
basis
of
prior
salary
and
family
size,
and
it
ranges
from
70%
to
90%
of
prior
salary,
depending
the
low
end,
a
single
man
at
the
high
end
demand
with
the
wife
and
two
or
more
children.
mr.
harris
weinstein
no,
the
record
doesn't
go
into
that.
i
suppose
justice
white
there
could
be
a
variety
of
reasons.
it
might
just
be
an
inducement
to
be
done
with
his
work
and
come
back
as
soon
as
possible.
mr.
harris
weinstein
the
record
bears
on
that
indirectly
and
showing
that
westinghouse
on
advice
of
their
tax
counsel
withheld
taxes
from
this
portion
of
the
benefits.
no
one
asked
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
well,
certainly,
the
record
doesn't
show
that
it
was
an
anticipation
of
tax
consequences.
now,
this
program
is
typical,
yet
the
payments
might
not
be.
for
example,
the
federal
government
sends
a
good
number
of
civilian
and
military
employees
to
school,
many
of
whom
study
for
degrees,
and
these
people
received
their
full
salaries.
now,
i
think
it
rather
hard
to
distinguish
and
defining
a
scholarship
or
fellowship
between
whether
a
man
gets
a
100%
of
his
salary
or
90%
of
one
of
the
respondent
--
as
one
of
the
respondents
did
here.
mr.
harris
weinstein
no,
because
as
i
come
to
the
statute,
it's
very
specific
on
that
and
would
--
if
they
are
a
degree
candidate,
it
would
be
excluded.
if
they
are
not
a
degree
candidate,
it
would
be
excluded
up
to
300
a
month
for
36
months.
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
think
the
legislative
history
bears
on
this
subject
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
no,
the
statute
is
completely
neutral
i
would
say
on
the
--
what
is
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
--
definittion.
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes,
i
would
and
i
would
say
that
that
supported
by
the
expressions
of
opinion
in
the
committee
reports
that
congress
did
not
want
to
exempt.
they
didn't
think
it
was
exempting
from
tax
what
it
call
a
continuing
salary
payments
to
an
employee
who
was
on
leave
from
his
regular
job.
and
i
really
think
that
that
legislative
history
is
the
basic
support
for
the
regulations
that
we
are
relying
on
here.
three
respondents
here
were
on
leave
at
varying
times
between
1960
and
1962.
two
of
them
for
nine
months,
they
receive
$630.00
a
month
which
was
80%
of
their
prior
salaries.
the
third
one
was
on
leave
for
a
full
year.
he
was
--
he
received
during
that
period
just
under
$9,700.00
and
that
was
90%
of
the
salary
he
had
been
receiving
before
beginning
the
leave.
mr.
harris
weinstein
again
justice
stewart,
i
would
suppose
so
these
questions
weren't
ask.
the
laboratory
is
in
pittsburgh.
they
are
restricted
to
the
choice
of
these
two
universities
to
participate
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
and
they
are
both
local
and
of
course,
they've
been
going
to
classes
there
for
four
years
at
least
before
they
take
their
leave.
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes.
i
think
that
technically
justice
stewart,
that
might
be
includable
in
gross
income,
but
at
the
same
time
they've
been
given
a
deduction
for
it
under
the
educational
expense
provision,
so
it
would
be
a
wash
there's
been
no
dispute
about
that
part
of
the
case.
mr.
harris
weinstein
as
we
say
in
our
reply
brief,
we
understand
that
distinction
bet
--
to
rest
on
the
idea
that
scholarship
means
degree
candidate
and
fellowship
means
nondegree
candidate,
and
we've
just
found
no
support
for
that
kind
of
distinction
(voice
overlap).
mr.
harris
weinstein
it
might
be,
although
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
think
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
think
it
would
come
down
to
this.
i
would
think
that
it
would
come
down
to
this,
and
a
grant
to
a
--
an
undergraduate
i
think
is
always
called
a
scholarship.
a
grant
to
somebody
who
is
not
seeking
any
kind
of
degree
is
i
think
generally
called
a
fellowship.
when
you
go
to
graduate
students,
they
could
be
either.
the
only
definition
that
we
found
was
in
the
catalog
of
m.i.t.
which
says
that
a
scholarship
in
to
a
graduate
student
means
something
that
just
covers
tuition,
and
the
fellowship
to
a
graduate
student
means
something
that
covers
tuition
plus
other
things.
mr.
harris
weinstein
that
is
their
argument
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
--
and
i
think
our
answer
to
what
is
two
things.
first,
that
we
don't
understand
that
that's
ever
been
the
any
--
be
accepted
understanding
of
those
words
in
any
place,
which
would
lead
us
to
think
that
if
congress
had
meant
that
rather
unusual
distinction
it
would've
been
more
direct
than
saying
so.
and
the
--
i
think
the
other
answer
really
comes
down
to
why
these
regulations
exist
and
perhaps
i
ought
to
turn
to
those
because
this
case
i
think
focuses
on
the
validity
of
these
regulations.
the
statute
really
has
no
definition,
the
statute.
you're
left
on
the
statute
i
think
to
infer
from
why
the
statute
was
adopted
and
what
congress
said
about
it
how
this
sort
of
case
ought
to
be
resolve,
and
the
treasury
which
has
general
rule
in
making
power.
it
sought
to
use
that
power
to
fill
what
is
really
an
interstice
in
the
statute.
and
these
regulations
that
the
treasury
has
adopted
were
accepted
by
the
controlling
legal
theory
as
a
controlling
legal
theory
by
the
district
judge.
they
form
the
basis
for
instructions,
for
rulings
on
evidence
and
they
--
and
for
that
reason,
i
think
that
the
basis
for
the
regulations
is
the
heart
really
of
this
case,
and
if
those
regulations
are
reasonable,
if
they're
rational
interpretations
of
the
statute,
then
we
would
suggest
that
the
treasury
has
properly
exercise
its
power
and
drawing
or
rather
hard
line
in
what
we
would
agree
as
a
rather
hard
case
of
statutory
interpretation.
and
if
i
--
these
regulations
if
i
can
turn
to
their
language,
start
out
with
a
general
definition
that
says
generally
speaking
that
a
scholarship
is
an
amount
paid
to
allow
student
to
pursue
studies,
a
fellowship,
to
allow
a
student
to
pursue
studies
or
research.
and
if
the
regulations
stop
there,
this
case
wouldn't
have
arisen
because
these
payments
would
have
qualified.
but
the
dispute
focuses
on
two
exceptions
that
are
in
these
regulations
and
that
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
of
study
or
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
but
individual
i
would
suggest
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
oh!
i
think
the
reason
is
that
an
individual
could
be
either;
it
could
be
a
student
or
a
non-student.
i
don't
believe
that
these
regulations
were
intended
in
that
subparagraph
c
to
not
apply
to
a
student
but
rather
the
word
individual
was
used
to
encompass
student
as
well
as
somebody
who
is
not.
and
i
think
that
that
would
agree
with
the
general
understanding
of
fellowship
which
might
be
to
a
graduate
student
or
might
not
be.
the
exceptions
which
are
also
set
out
in
our
appendix
to
these
general
definitions
are
twofold.
one
says
that
a
scholarship
or
fellowship
does
not
include
amounts
that
represent
compensation
for
past,
present,
or
future
employment
services.
and
the
second
says
that
a
scholarship
or
fellowship
does
not
encompass
amounts
that
are
paid
to
finance
study
or
research
undertaken
and
the
words
are
primarily
for
the
benefit
of
the
grantor.
now,
both
of
these
exceptions
represent
generalizations
of
concerns
or
the
congress
evidence
or
things
that
congress
did
when
it
was
drafting
this
part
of
the
revenue
code.
this
part
of
the
code
was
a
direct
response
to
some
very
specific
problems
that
the
treasury
had
in
years
preceding
1954.
and
these
were
how
to
treat
amounts
of
paid
research
and
teaching
assistance
and
how
to
treat
foundation
grants
to
the
nonstudent,
often
a
--
an
established
research
or
a
professional
who
wanted
to
continue
his
area
of
activity.
the
only
way
of
doing
this
before
1954
was
to
apply
concepts
of
gift,
and
39
code
is
now
if
a
gift
was
intended,
the
amount
was
not
taxable.
now,
the
difficulty
with
this
was
that
it
was
a
rather
anomalous
approach.
as
things
worked
out,
the
foundation
grant
to
an
established
professional
which
is
of
reasonably
substantial
amount
of
proceeds
from
what
could
be
called
the
disinterested
generosity,
so,
it
is
a
gift.
the
small
amounts
paid
graduate
students
who
are
required
to
teach
or
do
research
are
pay
to
an
employee,
so
those
are
taxed.
this
is
a
sensible
interpretation
of
gift,
but
in
terms
of
tax
policy
in
terms
of
what
one
might
want
to
exempt
or
not
exempt
is
questionable
whether
this
make
sense.
it
was
against
this
background
at
section
117
was
adopted.
it
has
in
its
first
sections,
117
(a),
a
general
exclusion
to
amounts
paid
as
scholarships
or
fellowships.
then
section
117
(b)
expressly
deals
with
these
two
problems,
117
(b)
(1)
deals
with
the
research
assistant
or
teaching
assistant,
and
it
expressly
provides
that
amounts
paid
to
that
type
of
person
are
to
be
taxed
unless
that
person
is
performing
duties
for
example
practice
teaching
that
it
require
of
all
candidates
for
the
degree
including
those
of
course
who
would
not
have
fellowships
or
scholarships.
now,
in
drafting
these
provisions,
congress
set
two
things,
and
the
parts
of
the
regulations
that
we're
concerned
with
here
represent
generalizations
of
what
congress
set.
in
dealing
with
the
nondegree
candidates
in
establishing
this
$300.00
per
month
exclusion,
both
houses
of
congress
in
their
committee
reports
said
that
they
did
not
intend
to
grant
exclusions
for
amounts
that
could
fairly
be
called
continuing
payments
of
salary
during
a
period
when
the
recipient
is
on
leave
from
his
regular
job.
that's
the
language
of
the
house
report;
it
is
essentially
repeated
in
the
senate
report.
and
the
house
did
this
on
the
context
of
a
--
an
objective
formula
which
have
would
have
excluded
fellowships
only
if
the
fellowship
grant
and
the
employee's
compensation
from
a
prior
employer
were
less
than
75%
of
its
prior
salary.
the
senate
changed
the
formula,
but
expressed
the
same
general
idea.
and
the
reason
the
senate
changed
the
formula
does
not
bear
on
this
case.
it's
because
it
was
called
to
the
senate's
attention
that
certain
people
for
example,
people
who
just
got
a
medical
degree
and
we're
giving
--
being
given
a
fellowship
would
under
the
house
formula
had
been
taxed
because
they
had
no
real
income
before
they
started
on
their
research
or
post-doctoral
fellowship.
now,
the
part
of
the
regulation,
this
--
excludes
from
the
fellowship
or
scholarship
compensation
for
past,
present
or
future
services,
we
suggest
has
its
direct
antecedent
in
this
aspect
of
the
legislative
history.
congress
was
quite
clear
that
it
did
not
want
to
exempt
payments
of
salary
while
the
recipient
is
on
leave
from
his
regular
job,
and
we
suggest
that
in
this
part
of
the
regulation,
the
treasury
is
quite
directly
implemented
that
expression
of
congressional
concern.
the
second
part
of
the
regulation
which
speaks
of
the
primary
purpose
of
the
grant
comes
out
of
the
legislative
history
of
section
117
(b)
(1)
which
taxes
amounts
pay
to
teaching
and
research
assistance.
now,
that
exemption
does
not
apply
if
the
teaching
or
research
is
required
of
everybody
who
is
a
candidate
for
the
degree,
even
if
he
doesn't
have
a
scholarship.
in
congress
in
explaining
that
dichotomy
said
that
it
was
drafting
the
statute
so
that
it
would
not
tax
a
grant
which
involves
research
or
teaching
services
perform
primarily
for
the
training
and
education
of
the
recipient,
so
that
the
second
exclusion
of
the
regulations
finds
its
direct
antecedent
and
not
portion
of
the
legislative
history.
so
what
we
have
is
a
treasury
attempt
to
synthesize
and
give
expression
to
the
general
concerns
that
congress
showed
in
drafting
this
statute.
there
are
several
arguments
made
against
this,
both
by
respondent
and
by
the
court
below
which
i'd
like
to
deal
with
very
briefly.
congress
said
that
it
was
trying
to
avoid
a
case-by-case
inquiry
into
the
existence
of
gift,
and
from
this,
it's
been
suggested
and
argued
that
congress
was
trying
to
avoid
a
case-by-case
inquiry
into
anything,
even
compensation.
we
find
no
support
for
that
in
the
legislative
history,
none
has
ever
been
cited.
congress
on
rather
make
clear
that
it
did
not
want
to
let
compensatory
or
bargain
for
arrangement
escape
tax,
and
this
is
the
effect
of
the
treasury
regulations
as
to
support
that
purpose.
the
second
point
which
i
think
is
really
at
the
basis
of
the
third
circuit
opinion
here
is
the
view
that
congress
in
section
117
wanted
to
do
everything
it
could
to
encourage
education,
and
that
the
interpretation
rendered
below
encourages
education.
what
is
true
that
congress
wanted
to
encourage
education
through
certain
tax
incentives,
but
that
is
not
the
function
of
section
117.
congress
has
attempts
to
encourage
education
are
in
other
parts
of
the
code
in
section
501
which
establishes
tax
--
allows
tax-free
foundations
in
educational
institutions,
and
in
section
117
which
allows
deductions
for
donations
to
that
sort
of
organization.
neither
of
these
bear
on
this
case
which
is
a
commercial
enterprise
arises
in
a
commercial
setting
in
a
bargain
for
arrangement.
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes.
mr.
harris
weinstein
with
no
quid
pro
quo.
mr.
harris
weinstein
he
wasn't
promised
that
one
he
first
came
to
work.
mr.
harris
weinstein
he
was
not
obligated
to
come
back.
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
do
not
think
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
don't
think
that
we
would
assert
that
that
is
compensation
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes.
we
rely
on
that
bundle
of
facts
and
i
think
that
bundle
is
typical
of
a
case
as
we've
been
litigating.
thank
you.
mr.
harris
weinstein
mr.
chief
justice,
if
i
may
quickly
deal
with
several
points
particularly
once
of
record
and
of
other
decisions.
in
response
to
mr.
justice
harlan's
question,
the
cases
and
conflict
are
in
the
fifth
and
sixth
circuit
and
in
the
court
of
claims,
and
there
are
two
cases,
one
in
the
tenth
and
a
per
curiam
in
the
fourth
that
would
be
believed
conflicting
rationale
and
they're
discussed
in
our
brief
beginning
at
page
23.
in
terms
of
the
relationship
between
westinghouse
and
the
employer
during
the
leave,
there's
a
requirement
for
periodic
progress
reports,
and
this
is
discussed
i
believe
in
the
testimony
at
page
18
of
the
record
at
least,
it
maybe
in
other
places.
in
terms
of
westinghouse's
rights
against
the
employer
--
employee
who
defaults
on
its
obligation
to
come
back,
we
set
out
that
pennsylvania
cases
which
we
think
at
least
give
a
right
to
sue
for
the
actual
expenditures
made
on
behalf
of
the
employee
during
the
leave.
in
terms
of
limitations
on
amount,
respondents
now
say
there's
a
rule
of
reason.
congress
didn't
even
think
things
would
go
that
far
because
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
congress
expected
that
this
would
be
relatively
small
amounts.
if
i
--
although
my
time
is
up,
if
i
may
just
speak
to
this
question
of
the
relationship
of
the
thesis
topic
to
westinghouse's
program.
at
page
104
of
the
record
which
is
westinghouse's
regulations
on
this
subject,
it
encourages
employees
to
find
topics
of
technical
interest
to
bettis.
in
the
testimony
at
pages
61
and
62,
a
westinghouse
official
testifies
on
this
question
of
thesis
review.
in
the
first
line
of
page
62,
he
uses
the
word
“relevance”
in
determining
the
relationship
between
thesis
topic
and
westinghouse
work.
pages
74
and
75,
the
responsible
official
of
the
atomic
energy
commission
speaks
of
job
relatedness
in
terms
of
the
connection
with
the
thesis.
but
in
closing,
i
would
just
like
to
say
that
we
do
not
depend
just
on
the
fact
that
the
thesis
topic
is
reviewed,
but
this
thesis
topic
review
and
the
entire
program
is
part
of
an
overall
package
of
compensation
the
westinghouse
and
the
a.e.c.
have
designed
to
obtain
people
like
the
respondents
for
six
or
seven
years,
and
the
fifth
year,
they
get
this
leave
and
this
obligates
them
to
return
as
in
the
case
of
one
respondent
for
the
sixth
year,
and
the
case
of
the
other
two
for
the
sixth
and
seventh
years
and
it
is
this
obligation
that
to
us
is
the
keystone
of
this
case.
mr.
harris
weinstein
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
federal
income
tax
case
comes
to
this
court
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit.
the
issue
involves
the
meaning
of
the
words
scholarship
and
fellowship
grant
which
are
used
in
section
117
of
the
internal
revenue
code
of
1954.
that
section
of
the
code
allows
the
recipient
to
exclude
the
amount
of
scholarships
or
fellowships
from
his
gross
income.
that
is
it
makes
scholarships
and
fellowships
tax
exempt.
this
case
typifies
a
tax
problem
that
seems
to
have
arisen
since
the
1954
code
was
adopted.
at
least,
congress
in
writing
section
117
in
the
legislative
history
showed
no
then
awareness
of
this
type
of
problem.
it
is
basically
this.
it
goes
to
the
meaning
of
the
words
scholarship
and
fellowship
in
a
commercial
setting.
do
those
words
encompass
the
situation
where
an
employer
gives
his
employee
leave
from
his
regular
duties
and
continues
the
employee's
regular
salary
or
the
greater
part
of
it
while
the
employee
is
taking
a
graduate
degree
on
the
subject
matter
of
his
employment,
and
at
the
same
time,
the
employer
obligates
the
employee
to
return
to
work
for
some
specified
minimum
period
of
time.
the
issue
comes
to
the
court
because
of
a
split
of
authority
among
the
lower
federal
courts.
the
fifth
and
sixth
circuits
and
the
court
of
claims
have
each
sustained
treasury
regulations
tending
to
the
view
that
payments
made
in
this
type
of
commercial
setting
are
not
scholarships
or
fellowships.
the
third
circuit
in
this
case
has
rejected
those
regulations
has
ruled
that
these
payments
are
scholarship
or
fellowship
and
has
reversed
a
jury
verdict
in
favor
of
the
united
states.
the
precise
problem
comes
out
at
payments
that
the
westinghouse
electric
corporation
made
to
the
three
respondents
before
this
court
at
a
time
when
those
respondents
were
on
leave,
working
on
doctoral
dissertations.
these
amounts
were
paid
pursuant
to
program
available
to
engineers
and
scientists
employed
at
the
bettis
atomic
power
laboratory
at
pittsburg,
pennsylvania.
that
is
a
laboratory
owned
by
the
atomic
energy
commission
and
most
if
not
all
of
its
activities
seemed
to
be
in
the
design
of
nuclear
reactors
for
producing
electric
power.
westinghouse
operates
the
laboratory
under
cost-plus
contract
with
the
atomic
energy
commission.
in
this
particular
program
that
we're
concern
with
here,
and
i
think
it's
typical
of
similar
programs,
is
intended
as
a
testimony
here
shows
to
meet
the
needs
that
westinghouse
and
the
a.e.c.
have
for
highly
trained
technical
people
to
help
them
recruit
these
people
to
keep
them
over
a
long
period
of
time
and
to
keep
them
up
to
date
on
technical
requirements
of
their
job.
the
program
that
we're
concerned
with
is
broken
into
two
phases.
the
first
one
which
is
called
the
work-study
phase
has
not
given
rise
to
any
tax
dispute,
at
least
up
to
now.
at
last
for
four
years
and
it
begins
when
the
employee
is
accepted
by
westinghouse
into
this
bettis
program.
in
the
case
of
two
of
the
respondents,
that
occurred
when
they
agreed
to
work
for
westinghouse
with
the
third
respondent
that
occurred
sometime
after
he
had
come
to
work
for
westinghouse.
during
this
four-year
work-study
phase,
the
employee
holds
down
a
regular
job
at
the
bettis
laboratory
and
he
attends
classes
part-time
at
either
the
university
of
pittsburg
or
the
carnegie
institute
of
technology,
which
i
think
since
the
events
in
this
case,
has
become
the
carnegie-mellon
university.
westinghouse
pays
the
employee
for
40
hours
a
week,
but
allows
him
eight
hours
weekly
up
to
i
think
a
total
of
156
hours
each
year
to
go
to
class.
westinghouse
pays
his
tuition
fees
during
that
period.
at
the
end
of
this
four-year
period,
employees
are
supposed
to
have
met
his
preliminary
requirements
for
the
doctoral
degree
in
engineering
or
science.
when
all
his
course
work,
his
language
studies
are
finished
and
he's
pass
the
qualification
examinations
for
the
doctoral
degree,
he
applies
for
a
leave
of
absence
to
work
on
his
dissertation.
he
receives
a
leave
of
absence
if
westinghouse
and
the
a.e.c.
each
approve
the
applicant,
not
all
are
approved,
and
if
westinghouse
and
the
a.e.c.
each
approve
his
thesis
topic
which
in
the
first
instance
approved
by
the
university.
if
he
is
granted
leave,
he
then
agrees
to
come
back
to
westinghouse
for
some
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
believe
justice
fortas
that
the
testimony
which
is
our
call
on
this
topic
was
of
a
representative
of
the
a.e.c.
was
that
they
wanted
the
topic
to
be
work
connected.
now,
i
think
that
has
a
broad
scope
and
it
certainly
does
not
mean
a
topic
of
current
use
or
of
current
concern
to
the
laboratory,
but
i
would
suppose
that
it
rather
means
a
topic
that
by
its
nature
helps
the
man
learn
better
how
to
work
on
the
problems
at
the
laboratory.
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
think
justice
fortas,
i'll
go
too
far
if
i
said
that
it
was
of
immediate
commercial
value
at
the
time
that
is
was
performed.
it
may
or
may
not
be,
and
i
think
that
work
connected
was
used
in
the
somewhat
more
general
sense.
of
the
topics
here
were
chosen
by
in
this
case
were
chosen
by
the
respondents.
they
were
generally
related
to
the
area
of
interest
which
i
think
were
the
areas
were
the
respondents
had
worked
generally
speaking
before
taking
their
leave.
the
topics
were
approved
by
the
a.e.c.
and
westinghouse.
there
is
apparently
precedent
for
disapproval
but
it
did
not
happened
with
any
of
these
three
respondents.
now
in
return
for
the
this
leave,
the
respondent
agrees
to
return
for
a
--
to
westinghouse
at
that
is
for
a
minimum
period
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
think
justice
fortas
that
if
there
is
a
vagueness
there;
it
is
a
vagueness
that
reflects
the
record.
this
record
did
not
involve
any
topics
that
had
been
disapproved,
denied
beyond
inquiring
whether
there
was
approved
or
whether
there
had
ever
been
any
instances
of
disapproval.
i
do
not
believe
there
was
any
inquiry
into
what
might
leave
the
a.e.c.
and
westinghouse
to
disapprove
a
particular
contract.
and
i
don't
want
to
suggest
that
the
topics
were
viewed
for
immediate
commercial
benefit
at
that
point.
this
minimum
period
of
obligation
after
the
leave
was
in
the
case
of
two
respondents
here,
two
years,
and
the
case
of
the
third,
who
came
under
an
earlier
version
of
the
same
program,
he
was
committed
to
return
to
westinghouse
for
one
year
after
his
leave.
during
the
leave,
westinghouse
pays
all
tuition
and
fees,
and
those
amounts
are
not
in
dispute
here.
they
have
not
been
taxed
and
there
is
no
contention
that
they
should
be
taxed.
the
dispute
goes
to
an
amount
that
is
paid
calculated
on
the
basis
of
prior
salary
and
family
size,
and
it
ranges
from
70%
to
90%
of
prior
salary,
depending
the
low
end,
a
single
man
at
the
high
end
demand
with
the
wife
and
two
or
more
children.
mr.
harris
weinstein
no,
the
record
doesn't
go
into
that.
i
suppose
justice
white
there
could
be
a
variety
of
reasons.
it
might
just
be
an
inducement
to
be
done
with
his
work
and
come
back
as
soon
as
possible.
mr.
harris
weinstein
the
record
bears
on
that
indirectly
and
showing
that
westinghouse
on
advice
of
their
tax
counsel
withheld
taxes
from
this
portion
of
the
benefits.
no
one
asked
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
well,
certainly,
the
record
doesn't
show
that
it
was
an
anticipation
of
tax
consequences.
now,
this
program
is
typical,
yet
the
payments
might
not
be.
for
example,
the
federal
government
sends
a
good
number
of
civilian
and
military
employees
to
school,
many
of
whom
study
for
degrees,
and
these
people
received
their
full
salaries.
now,
i
think
it
rather
hard
to
distinguish
and
defining
a
scholarship
or
fellowship
between
whether
a
man
gets
a
100%
of
his
salary
or
90%
of
one
of
the
respondent
--
as
one
of
the
respondents
did
here.
mr.
harris
weinstein
no,
because
as
i
come
to
the
statute,
it's
very
specific
on
that
and
would
--
if
they
are
a
degree
candidate,
it
would
be
excluded.
if
they
are
not
a
degree
candidate,
it
would
be
excluded
up
to
300
a
month
for
36
months.
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
think
the
legislative
history
bears
on
this
subject
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
no,
the
statute
is
completely
neutral
i
would
say
on
the
--
what
is
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
--
definittion.
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes,
i
would
and
i
would
say
that
that
supported
by
the
expressions
of
opinion
in
the
committee
reports
that
congress
did
not
want
to
exempt.
they
didn't
think
it
was
exempting
from
tax
what
it
call
a
continuing
salary
payments
to
an
employee
who
was
on
leave
from
his
regular
job.
and
i
really
think
that
that
legislative
history
is
the
basic
support
for
the
regulations
that
we
are
relying
on
here.
three
respondents
here
were
on
leave
at
varying
times
between
1960
and
1962.
two
of
them
for
nine
months,
they
receive
$630.00
a
month
which
was
80%
of
their
prior
salaries.
the
third
one
was
on
leave
for
a
full
year.
he
was
--
he
received
during
that
period
just
under
$9,700.00
and
that
was
90%
of
the
salary
he
had
been
receiving
before
beginning
the
leave.
mr.
harris
weinstein
again
justice
stewart,
i
would
suppose
so
these
questions
weren't
ask.
the
laboratory
is
in
pittsburgh.
they
are
restricted
to
the
choice
of
these
two
universities
to
participate
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
and
they
are
both
local
and
of
course,
they've
been
going
to
classes
there
for
four
years
at
least
before
they
take
their
leave.
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes.
i
think
that
technically
justice
stewart,
that
might
be
includable
in
gross
income,
but
at
the
same
time
they've
been
given
a
deduction
for
it
under
the
educational
expense
provision,
so
it
would
be
a
wash
there's
been
no
dispute
about
that
part
of
the
case.
mr.
harris
weinstein
as
we
say
in
our
reply
brief,
we
understand
that
distinction
bet
--
to
rest
on
the
idea
that
scholarship
means
degree
candidate
and
fellowship
means
nondegree
candidate,
and
we've
just
found
no
support
for
that
kind
of
distinction
(voice
overlap).
mr.
harris
weinstein
it
might
be,
although
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
think
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
think
it
would
come
down
to
this.
i
would
think
that
it
would
come
down
to
this,
and
a
grant
to
a
--
an
undergraduate
i
think
is
always
called
a
scholarship.
a
grant
to
somebody
who
is
not
seeking
any
kind
of
degree
is
i
think
generally
called
a
fellowship.
when
you
go
to
graduate
students,
they
could
be
either.
the
only
definition
that
we
found
was
in
the
catalog
of
m.i.t.
which
says
that
a
scholarship
in
to
a
graduate
student
means
something
that
just
covers
tuition,
and
the
fellowship
to
a
graduate
student
means
something
that
covers
tuition
plus
other
things.
mr.
harris
weinstein
that
is
their
argument
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
--
and
i
think
our
answer
to
what
is
two
things.
first,
that
we
don't
understand
that
that's
ever
been
the
any
--
be
accepted
understanding
of
those
words
in
any
place,
which
would
lead
us
to
think
that
if
congress
had
meant
that
rather
unusual
distinction
it
would've
been
more
direct
than
saying
so.
and
the
--
i
think
the
other
answer
really
comes
down
to
why
these
regulations
exist
and
perhaps
i
ought
to
turn
to
those
because
this
case
i
think
focuses
on
the
validity
of
these
regulations.
the
statute
really
has
no
definition,
the
statute.
you're
left
on
the
statute
i
think
to
infer
from
why
the
statute
was
adopted
and
what
congress
said
about
it
how
this
sort
of
case
ought
to
be
resolve,
and
the
treasury
which
has
general
rule
in
making
power.
it
sought
to
use
that
power
to
fill
what
is
really
an
interstice
in
the
statute.
and
these
regulations
that
the
treasury
has
adopted
were
accepted
by
the
controlling
legal
theory
as
a
controlling
legal
theory
by
the
district
judge.
they
form
the
basis
for
instructions,
for
rulings
on
evidence
and
they
--
and
for
that
reason,
i
think
that
the
basis
for
the
regulations
is
the
heart
really
of
this
case,
and
if
those
regulations
are
reasonable,
if
they're
rational
interpretations
of
the
statute,
then
we
would
suggest
that
the
treasury
has
properly
exercise
its
power
and
drawing
or
rather
hard
line
in
what
we
would
agree
as
a
rather
hard
case
of
statutory
interpretation.
and
if
i
--
these
regulations
if
i
can
turn
to
their
language,
start
out
with
a
general
definition
that
says
generally
speaking
that
a
scholarship
is
an
amount
paid
to
allow
student
to
pursue
studies,
a
fellowship,
to
allow
a
student
to
pursue
studies
or
research.
and
if
the
regulations
stop
there,
this
case
wouldn't
have
arisen
because
these
payments
would
have
qualified.
but
the
dispute
focuses
on
two
exceptions
that
are
in
these
regulations
and
that
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
of
study
or
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
but
individual
i
would
suggest
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
oh!
i
think
the
reason
is
that
an
individual
could
be
either;
it
could
be
a
student
or
a
non-student.
i
don't
believe
that
these
regulations
were
intended
in
that
subparagraph
c
to
not
apply
to
a
student
but
rather
the
word
individual
was
used
to
encompass
student
as
well
as
somebody
who
is
not.
and
i
think
that
that
would
agree
with
the
general
understanding
of
fellowship
which
might
be
to
a
graduate
student
or
might
not
be.
the
exceptions
which
are
also
set
out
in
our
appendix
to
these
general
definitions
are
twofold.
one
says
that
a
scholarship
or
fellowship
does
not
include
amounts
that
represent
compensation
for
past,
present,
or
future
employment
services.
and
the
second
says
that
a
scholarship
or
fellowship
does
not
encompass
amounts
that
are
paid
to
finance
study
or
research
undertaken
and
the
words
are
primarily
for
the
benefit
of
the
grantor.
now,
both
of
these
exceptions
represent
generalizations
of
concerns
or
the
congress
evidence
or
things
that
congress
did
when
it
was
drafting
this
part
of
the
revenue
code.
this
part
of
the
code
was
a
direct
response
to
some
very
specific
problems
that
the
treasury
had
in
years
preceding
1954.
and
these
were
how
to
treat
amounts
of
paid
research
and
teaching
assistance
and
how
to
treat
foundation
grants
to
the
nonstudent,
often
a
--
an
established
research
or
a
professional
who
wanted
to
continue
his
area
of
activity.
the
only
way
of
doing
this
before
1954
was
to
apply
concepts
of
gift,
and
39
code
is
now
if
a
gift
was
intended,
the
amount
was
not
taxable.
now,
the
difficulty
with
this
was
that
it
was
a
rather
anomalous
approach.
as
things
worked
out,
the
foundation
grant
to
an
established
professional
which
is
of
reasonably
substantial
amount
of
proceeds
from
what
could
be
called
the
disinterested
generosity,
so,
it
is
a
gift.
the
small
amounts
paid
graduate
students
who
are
required
to
teach
or
do
research
are
pay
to
an
employee,
so
those
are
taxed.
this
is
a
sensible
interpretation
of
gift,
but
in
terms
of
tax
policy
in
terms
of
what
one
might
want
to
exempt
or
not
exempt
is
questionable
whether
this
make
sense.
it
was
against
this
background
at
section
117
was
adopted.
it
has
in
its
first
sections,
117
(a),
a
general
exclusion
to
amounts
paid
as
scholarships
or
fellowships.
then
section
117
(b)
expressly
deals
with
these
two
problems,
117
(b)
(1)
deals
with
the
research
assistant
or
teaching
assistant,
and
it
expressly
provides
that
amounts
paid
to
that
type
of
person
are
to
be
taxed
unless
that
person
is
performing
duties
for
example
practice
teaching
that
it
require
of
all
candidates
for
the
degree
including
those
of
course
who
would
not
have
fellowships
or
scholarships.
now,
in
drafting
these
provisions,
congress
set
two
things,
and
the
parts
of
the
regulations
that
we're
concerned
with
here
represent
generalizations
of
what
congress
set.
in
dealing
with
the
nondegree
candidates
in
establishing
this
$300.00
per
month
exclusion,
both
houses
of
congress
in
their
committee
reports
said
that
they
did
not
intend
to
grant
exclusions
for
amounts
that
could
fairly
be
called
continuing
payments
of
salary
during
a
period
when
the
recipient
is
on
leave
from
his
regular
job.
that's
the
language
of
the
house
report;
it
is
essentially
repeated
in
the
senate
report.
and
the
house
did
this
on
the
context
of
a
--
an
objective
formula
which
have
would
have
excluded
fellowships
only
if
the
fellowship
grant
and
the
employee's
compensation
from
a
prior
employer
were
less
than
75%
of
its
prior
salary.
the
senate
changed
the
formula,
but
expressed
the
same
general
idea.
and
the
reason
the
senate
changed
the
formula
does
not
bear
on
this
case.
it's
because
it
was
called
to
the
senate's
attention
that
certain
people
for
example,
people
who
just
got
a
medical
degree
and
we're
giving
--
being
given
a
fellowship
would
under
the
house
formula
had
been
taxed
because
they
had
no
real
income
before
they
started
on
their
research
or
post-doctoral
fellowship.
now,
the
part
of
the
regulation,
this
--
excludes
from
the
fellowship
or
scholarship
compensation
for
past,
present
or
future
services,
we
suggest
has
its
direct
antecedent
in
this
aspect
of
the
legislative
history.
congress
was
quite
clear
that
it
did
not
want
to
exempt
payments
of
salary
while
the
recipient
is
on
leave
from
his
regular
job,
and
we
suggest
that
in
this
part
of
the
regulation,
the
treasury
is
quite
directly
implemented
that
expression
of
congressional
concern.
the
second
part
of
the
regulation
which
speaks
of
the
primary
purpose
of
the
grant
comes
out
of
the
legislative
history
of
section
117
(b)
(1)
which
taxes
amounts
pay
to
teaching
and
research
assistance.
now,
that
exemption
does
not
apply
if
the
teaching
or
research
is
required
of
everybody
who
is
a
candidate
for
the
degree,
even
if
he
doesn't
have
a
scholarship.
in
congress
in
explaining
that
dichotomy
said
that
it
was
drafting
the
statute
so
that
it
would
not
tax
a
grant
which
involves
research
or
teaching
services
perform
primarily
for
the
training
and
education
of
the
recipient,
so
that
the
second
exclusion
of
the
regulations
finds
its
direct
antecedent
and
not
portion
of
the
legislative
history.
so
what
we
have
is
a
treasury
attempt
to
synthesize
and
give
expression
to
the
general
concerns
that
congress
showed
in
drafting
this
statute.
there
are
several
arguments
made
against
this,
both
by
respondent
and
by
the
court
below
which
i'd
like
to
deal
with
very
briefly.
congress
said
that
it
was
trying
to
avoid
a
case-by-case
inquiry
into
the
existence
of
gift,
and
from
this,
it's
been
suggested
and
argued
that
congress
was
trying
to
avoid
a
case-by-case
inquiry
into
anything,
even
compensation.
we
find
no
support
for
that
in
the
legislative
history,
none
has
ever
been
cited.
congress
on
rather
make
clear
that
it
did
not
want
to
let
compensatory
or
bargain
for
arrangement
escape
tax,
and
this
is
the
effect
of
the
treasury
regulations
as
to
support
that
purpose.
the
second
point
which
i
think
is
really
at
the
basis
of
the
third
circuit
opinion
here
is
the
view
that
congress
in
section
117
wanted
to
do
everything
it
could
to
encourage
education,
and
that
the
interpretation
rendered
below
encourages
education.
what
is
true
that
congress
wanted
to
encourage
education
through
certain
tax
incentives,
but
that
is
not
the
function
of
section
117.
congress
has
attempts
to
encourage
education
are
in
other
parts
of
the
code
in
section
501
which
establishes
tax
--
allows
tax-free
foundations
in
educational
institutions,
and
in
section
117
which
allows
deductions
for
donations
to
that
sort
of
organization.
neither
of
these
bear
on
this
case
which
is
a
commercial
enterprise
arises
in
a
commercial
setting
in
a
bargain
for
arrangement.
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes.
mr.
harris
weinstein
with
no
quid
pro
quo.
mr.
harris
weinstein
he
wasn't
promised
that
one
he
first
came
to
work.
mr.
harris
weinstein
he
was
not
obligated
to
come
back.
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
do
not
think
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
don't
think
that
we
would
assert
that
that
is
compensation
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes.
we
rely
on
that
bundle
of
facts
and
i
think
that
bundle
is
typical
of
a
case
as
we've
been
litigating.
thank
you.
mr.
harris
weinstein
mr.
chief
justice,
if
i
may
quickly
deal
with
several
points
particularly
once
of
record
and
of
other
decisions.
in
response
to
mr.
justice
harlan's
question,
the
cases
and
conflict
are
in
the
fifth
and
sixth
circuit
and
in
the
court
of
claims,
and
there
are
two
cases,
one
in
the
tenth
and
a
per
curiam
in
the
fourth
that
would
be
believed
conflicting
rationale
and
they're
discussed
in
our
brief
beginning
at
page
23.
in
terms
of
the
relationship
between
westinghouse
and
the
employer
during
the
leave,
there's
a
requirement
for
periodic
progress
reports,
and
this
is
discussed
i
believe
in
the
testimony
at
page
18
of
the
record
at
least,
it
maybe
in
other
places.
in
terms
of
westinghouse's
rights
against
the
employer
--
employee
who
defaults
on
its
obligation
to
come
back,
we
set
out
that
pennsylvania
cases
which
we
think
at
least
give
a
right
to
sue
for
the
actual
expenditures
made
on
behalf
of
the
employee
during
the
leave.
in
terms
of
limitations
on
amount,
respondents
now
say
there's
a
rule
of
reason.
congress
didn't
even
think
things
would
go
that
far
because
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
congress
expected
that
this
would
be
relatively
small
amounts.
if
i
--
although
my
time
is
up,
if
i
may
just
speak
to
this
question
of
the
relationship
of
the
thesis
topic
to
westinghouse's
program.
at
page
104
of
the
record
which
is
westinghouse's
regulations
on
this
subject,
it
encourages
employees
to
find
topics
of
technical
interest
to
bettis.
in
the
testimony
at
pages
61
and
62,
a
westinghouse
official
testifies
on
this
question
of
thesis
review.
in
the
first
line
of
page
62,
he
uses
the
word
“relevance”
in
determining
the
relationship
between
thesis
topic
and
westinghouse
work.
pages
74
and
75,
the
responsible
official
of
the
atomic
energy
commission
speaks
of
job
relatedness
in
terms
of
the
connection
with
the
thesis.
but
in
closing,
i
would
just
like
to
say
that
we
do
not
depend
just
on
the
fact
that
the
thesis
topic
is
reviewed,
but
this
thesis
topic
review
and
the
entire
program
is
part
of
an
overall
package
of
compensation
the
westinghouse
and
the
a.e.c.
have
designed
to
obtain
people
like
the
respondents
for
six
or
seven
years,
and
the
fifth
year,
they
get
this
leave
and
this
obligates
them
to
return
as
in
the
case
of
one
respondent
for
the
sixth
year,
and
the
case
of
the
other
two
for
the
sixth
and
seventh
years
and
it
