mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
indictment
is
aimed
not
at
the
discussion
or
dissemination
of
ideas
on
anarchy,
communism
or
what
have
you.
but
on
the
accumulation
of
an
arsenal
of
weapons
and
ammunition
and
gasoline
and
black
powder
to
overthrow
or
paralyze,
overthrow
for
a
week,
a
month
however
so
long
local
government
installations.
what
is
the
evidence
in
this
case
on
this
unusual
review
in
the
high
court?
the
evidence,
the
real
evidence
in
this
case
consists
of
6,524
rounds
of
ammunition,
plus
32
boxes
of
ammunition,
plus
six
cans
of
ammunition,
enough
ammunition
with
a
good
marksman
to
kill
9,000
people.
this
ammunition
was
seized
pursuant
to
an
arrest
warrant
plus
a
search
warrant
after
the
indictment
of
the
appellants
in
this
case.
in
addition,
we
have
43
guns
similarly
seized
pursuant
to
an
arrest
warrant
after
the
indictment
of
these
appellants,
plus
a
search
warrant
particularly
describing
what
was
to
be
seized.
these
weapons
--
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
this
is
part
--
--
action
for
an
injunction
and
a
declaratory
judgment
in
the
federal
court?
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
this
evidence
had
been
seized
already.
we've
had
--
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
we
can't
--
we
have
--
it's
in
the
grand
jury
minutes
from
page
1
to
45,
and
if
your
honor
wishes,
i'll
hand
them
up
for
the
consideration
of
this
court
alone.
i'm
not
permitted
to
publish
them
in
the
record
and
give
opposing
counsel
grand
jury
minutes.
it's
customary
in
our
high
court
of
our
state
to
hand
up
grand
jury
minutes
to
the
high
court
alone
and
let
them
consider
whether
or
not
there
was
sufficient
evidence
or
for
a
grand
jury
to
hold
someone
in
contempt
without
giving
the
other
side
the
entire
investigation.
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
well,
it
might
--
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
except
that
your
honor,
the
indictment
talks
in
the
first
four
counts
about
and
19
overt
acts
specified
in
count
five
about
discussions.
and
i
thought
it
might
be
material
resolving
a
question
of
what
constitutes
free
speech
to
have
some
inklings
about
the
nature
of
this
discussion.
and
for
that
reason,
i
still
offer
if
the
court
wants
to
peruse
them
whatever
value
they
may
have,
the
grand
jury
minutes
consisting
of
page
1
to
151
given
on
--
testimony
given
on
june
20,
1967
and
on
june
--
on
january
15,
1968
for
the
superseding
indictment
relating
to
these
weapons
in
describing
them
by
serial
number
and
color
and
so
forth,
pages
1
to
145.
i
happen
to
have
with
me
a
certified
copy.
if
the
court
would
--
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
your
honor,
i
happen
to
be
the
draftsman
of
those
10
consecutive
sections
of
the
penal
law
which
were
revised
in
1963
and
were
continued
without
any
change
when
the
entire
penal
law
was
revised
in
1965
to
take
effect
september
1,
1967.
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
yes,
they
were
indicted
under
--
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
yes,
your
honor.
now,
this
is
something
that
neither
counsel
appears
to
understand
because
they
have
not
read
the
weapons
law.
section
1897
is
the
heart
of
the
weapons
law.
it's
been
continued
in
the
new
penal
law.
this
law,
a
derivation
of
the
old
sullivan
law
makes
it
criminal
without
proof
of
anything
more
if
you
possess
a
handgun,
that's
a
gun,
a
pistol,
a
revolver,
an
automatic,
four
counts
in
the
indictment
deal
with
handguns.
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
no.
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
no,
she
is
not.
it
is
not
true,
your
honor.
the
other
remaining
37
counts
of
the
41
that
deal
with
weapons,
deal
with
shoulder
guns,
rifles,
shotguns,
and
carbines.
now,
it
is
not
criminal
in
new
york
to
possess
one
of
these
guns
unless
you
can
prove
intent
to
use
the
same
unlawfully
against
others.
obviously,
there
are
many
hunters
and
other
people
that
want
rifles.
the
usual
criminal
prosecution
for
possession
of
a
rifle
or
a
shotgun
or
a
carbine,
the
intent
is
to
rob
somebody,
to
assault
him
or
possibly
to
rape
some
woman.
in
this
case,
there
is
no
such
intent.
the
intent
is
merely
to
overthrow
the
local
(inaudible)
--
the
local
government.
now,
the
way
this
prosecution
came
about
because
of
the
statements
made
by
counsel
might
be
of
interest
of
this
court.
a
large
investment
in
time
and
money,
and
not
simply
sitting
under
a
shady
tree
rubbing
red
pepper
into
the
eyes
of
someone
else
was
expended
by
the
police.
several
undercover
detectives
were
assigned
over
a
period
of
almost
two
years
and
they
joined
and
infiltrate
this
organization.
one
of
them
got
into
the
higher
councils
of
the
organization,
became
a
vice-president
of
it
was
in
on
all
of
the
discussion.
this
man
by
the
way
showed
remarkable
courage
because
in
november
of
1966,
it
was
stated
to
him
by
the
leader
of
the
organization
that
they
knew
someone
of
their
members
was
an
agent,
an
enemy
agent
or
law
enforcement
agent.
in
any
event
from
what
the
police
told
the
district
attorney,
this
infiltration
started
in
october
1965.
in
april
of
1967,
the
police
first
came
to
the
district
attorney.
and
this
is
what
they
told
us,
they
told
us
about
these
discussions.
they
told
us
what
these
discussions
concern;
how
to
make
a
bomb,
whether
you
use
a
wine
bottle
with
thin
glass
containing
gasoline,
or
a
soft
drink
bottle
with
thicker
glass.
when
you
use
one,
when
you
use
the
other,
how
you
make
it.
the
problem
of
the
fuse
which
is
difficult
to
get,
how
can
you
hand
make
a
fuse?
one
fuse
is
a
pack
of
cigarettes;
pardon
me,
based
lighted
cigarette
on
a
pack
of
matches
on
top
of
the
molotov
cocktail,
the
gasoline.
another
one
is
to
get
a
rubber
tube,
fill
it
with
black
powder
and
insert
one
end
into
the
molotov
cocktail
and
light
the
other.
still
another
one,
when
you
pour
gasoline
into
the
streets
and
you
don't
want
to
burn
yourself,
use
a
flare
gun
not
a
match
because
you
would
go
up
to
the
flames.
how
do
you
--
how
do
you
manufacture
a
bazooka,
which
we
used
in
world
war
ii
in
the
korean
war
as
an
anti-attack
gun?
well,
you
use
a
shotgun
and
a
molotov
cocktail
and
of
how
you
can
combine
the
both.
how
you
use
gasoline
in
the
streets
to
prevent
police
response?
how
you
pour
gasoline
to
communications
manholes
into
the
publicly
owned
and
operated
subways
to
burn
down
two
lumber
yards,
to
burn
down
a
tire
factory,
and
how
you
similarly
use
oil?
how
you
disable
responding
public
vehicle
--
of
local
government?
by
slashing
tires,
by
putting
sugar
in
gas
tanks,
by
sniper
fire
--
22
caliber
sniper
fire
aimed
at
the
windshield.
how
you
disable
electric
power
and
how
you
differentiate
high-tension
telephone
wires
from
high-tension
electrical
wires?
how
--
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
on
june
20,
1967,
the
original
indictment
was
returned.
after
one
day
of
testimony
before
the
grand
jury
by
these
undercover
police
agents,
the
warrants
for
the
arrest
of
these
appellants,
particularly
the
same
day.
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
that
is
correct.
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
that
is
correct.
i
wanted
merely
to
go
to
the
--
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
your
honor,
it's
because
of
so
many
motions
that
have
been
made
in
this
case.
never
before
in
the
70-year
history
of
our
county,
which
is
the
fifth
largest
in
the
united
states
have
so
many
motions
been
made
in
the
single
case.
we
have
weighed
the
papers
on
a
scale.
they've
weighed
20
pounds
all
total.
everybody
made
a
motion
and
joined
in
someone
else's
motion.
and
we
did
however,
based
on
the
testimony
given
pages
1
to
151
these
grand
jury
minutes
which
the
court
may
or
may
not
accept
if
it
wishes.
we
returned
another
indictment,
conspiracy
to
murder
two
civil
rights
leaders
whitney
young
and
roy
wilkins.
we
tried
that
indictment
and
convicted
before
a
jury
two
of
the
appellants
here,
harris
and
ferguson.
and
that
conviction
is
pending
on
appeal.
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
since
march
12,
1968,
when
application
was
first
made
by
the
appellants
to
get
a
three-judge
panel.
and
the
decision
of
the
three-judge
panel
came
down
in
june
of
1968,
and
then
application
is
made
for
this
court's
review.
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
the
delay
from
june
20,
1967
to
march
12,
1968
has
no
connection
with
the
federal
court.
from
march
12,
1968
until
today
march
--
april
1,
1969
is
purely
federal
delay.
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
no,
the
district
attorney
--
one
of
the
assistant
district
attorneys
agreed
that
they
await
the
outcome
of
proceedings.
and
if
this
court
did
not
note
probable
jurisdiction
it
would've
gone
to
trial
the
next
day
in
the
state
court.
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
no,
no
your
honor.
now,
i'd
like
to
say
briefly
that
that's
what's
involved
in
this
case.
it's
not
advocacy
of
ideas
or
opinions.
it's
advocacy
of
minute
detailed
action.
i
want
to
add
one
or
two
more
types
of
actions
here
besides
the
assassination.
there
are
other
personal
types
of
instruction
that
i
have
never
seen
in
any
curriculum
in
my
life.
i
have
never
known
there
was
a
cause
in
mayhem
for
example.
how
you
use
the
blunt
end
of
a
hatchet
against
a
policeman
and
disable
him
by
hitting
him
on
the
base
of
the
spine.
i
never
heard
of
aikido,
a
japanese
combination
of
karate
and
judo,
which
operates
on
the
principle
of
hitting
you
at
a
joint
so
as
to
break
the
distal
ends
of
the
bone.
this
is
some
of
the
instruction
that
went
on
during
this
two-year
period
that
these
people
were
being
observed.
then,
interestingly
enough
and
this
is
finally
what
caused
the
grand
jury
to
act
in
queens
district
attorney
to
submit
it.
they
had
a
test
run
on
june
16,
this
indictment,
this
matter
was
presented
to
the
grand
jury
on
june
20.
a
test
run
involving
two
of
these
appellants
when
they
went
out
in
a
car
and
tried
out
these
tactics,
firing
shots
at
stall
windows
in
south
shoemaker
in
queens.
now,
under
these
circumstances,
we
thought
it
best
after
plans
had
been
formulated,
a
timetable
made
as
these
minutes
will
disclose
to
the
court,
weapons
had
been
accumulated
and
distributed
and
they
were
ready
to
go
that
now
if
the
heart
and
catastrophe
was
to
be
prevented,
action
had
to
be
taken.
now,
i
wanted
briefly
make
the
point
that
under
subdivision
9
of
section
1897,
you
must
prove
intent
if
it's
a
shoulder
gun.
and
the
intent
that
the
district
attorney
intends
to
urge
in
this
case
is
the
intent
to
overthrow
local
government.
not
to
rob
anybody,
not
to
assault
any
passersby,
not
to
you
do
what
999
out
of
a
thousand
rifled
cases
that
we
prosecute
involved,
but
the
rather
unusual
intent,
this
magnificent
protest
gesture
of
overthrowing
the
local
establishment.
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
no,
it
merely
says
anyone
who
possesses
a
dangerous
weapon,
and
weapon
is
defined
as
rifle
and
shotgun.
firearm
is
different,
that's
a
handgun.
anyone
who
possesses
a
rifle
or
shotgun
in
effect
with
the
intent
to
use
the
same
unlawfully
against
another
is
guilty
of
misdemeanor.
now,
we
could
not
--
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
we
maintain
it
is,
yes.
we
maintain
it
is.
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
no,
not
in
that
language,
your
honor.
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
it
says
merely
with
intent
to
use
the
same
unlawfully.
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
unlawfully.
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
the
law
that
we
--
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
section
1897
subdivision
9
of
the
former
penal
law.
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
it
says
anyone
who
has
in
his
possession
a
dangerous
weapon
with
intent
to
use
the
same
unlawfully
against
another.
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
yes.
in
a
criminal
anarchy
statutes
of
the
former
penal
law
section
116.
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
it
says
that
a
person
who
advocates
the
overthrow
of
government
by
force
or
violence
or
unlawful
means
is
guilty
of
criminal
anarchy.
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
that's
right.
and
that
is
where
the
unlawful
intent
of
a
possession
of
these
weapons
would
come
in
37
of
the
41
counts
that
deal
with
weapons
in
this
indictment.
now
with
respect
to
--
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
i
don't
know
because
in
this
test
run
that
i've
made
reference
to
judge
marshall,
they
didn't
shoot
--
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
if
we
could
prove
whom
they
wanted
to
harm,
not
people
generally.
but
if
i
could
prove
that
he
was
going
to
shoot
his
brother-in-law
or
that
he
intended
to
take
two
druggists
in
the
corner
then,
yes.
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
yes,
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
yes.
well,
your
honor,
the
intention
of
the
draftsman
of
the
weapons
statute
in
1963
--
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
i
was
only
the
draftsman,
a
committee
of
draftsmen.
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
yes,
because
we
thought
that
--
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
not
particularly
the
criminal
--
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
--
syndicalism
statute
your
honor,
but
any
thing
defined
in
the
penal
law
is
unlawful
was
what
was
meant
by
the
word
unlawful
in
subdivision
9
of
former
1897
of
the
penal
law.
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
and
that
included
criminal
anarchy.
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
oh
no!
no
your
honor,
no.
it
was
just
one
of
the
provisions
of
the
former
penal
law
that
were
included
when
these
weapon
statute
were
redrafted
in
1963.
that
was
in
--
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
yes,
your
honor,
in
37
counts
not
four
of
the
other
weapons
counts,
37,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
my
name
is
ludwig,
i'm
the
chief
assistant
district
attorney
of
queens.
this
is
the
second
time
this
case
is
being
argued.
the
first
time
on
april
1st,
you
mr.
chief
justice
and
justice
douglas
weren't
on
the
bench.
i
just
like
to
say
at
the
outset
that
the
question
of
publicity
in
this
case
was
brought
to
the
attention
of
one
of
our
best
supreme
court
justices,
justice
shapiro
in
queens
and
he
in
an
exhaustive
opinion
which
is
appended
to
my
brief
went
into
all
facets
of
the
question
and
his
conclusion
was
that
by
no
stretch
of
the
imagination
could
the
district
attorney
in
this
case
be
accused
of
issuing
any
inaccurate,
unfair
prejudicial
statements
regarding
this
matter
and
that
any
statement
the
district
attorney
ever
made
or
i
ever
made
in
connection
with
this
case
was
proper,
justified
and
something
the
public
had
right
to
know.
many
of
the
quotations
that
were
read
by
mrs.
piel
are
not
quotations
of
the
district
attorney
but
of
some
newspaper
reporter
writing
the
story
without
quotations
marks
and
i
think
in
all
candor
this
court
ought
to
know
that.
now,
the
defendant
in
this
case
is
the
district
attorney
of
queens,
actually
the
defendant
should
be
a
grand
jury
of
22
people
in
queens
who
saw
fit
to
accuse
these
defendants.
the
district
attorney
did
not
accuse
them.
they
were
accused
by
the
grand
jury.
the
district
attorney
knew
nothing
of
this
investigation
while
it
was
going
on
for
a
year
and
a
half
or
two
years
until
approximately
a
month
before
the
matter
was
produ
--
presented
to
the
grand
jury.
the
evidence
in
this
case
was
obtained
by
a
--
an
undercover
police
office
who
had
infiltrated
this
group,
became
a
part
of
it,
in
fact
was
a
vice
president
of
it
and
who
gained
enough
information
about
what
was
happening
to
enable
--
to
present
this
case
to
the
grand
jury.
now,
this
indictment
is
a
--
one
that
involves
15
defendants,
11
of
them
are
appellants
in
this
case.
the
other
four
did
not
appeal.
the
indictment
contains
48
counts
and
deals
with
five
crimes.
it's
a
superseding
inictment.
the
first
indictment
was
found
on
june
20th,
1967,
the
case
was
presented
on
june
20th,
the
foreman
handed
up
the
indictment
that
night.
it
was
a
one
day
presentation
in
great
confidence
and
secrecy
before
the
grand
jury.
the
foreman
handed
it
up
on
june
20th
in
--
and
the
defendants
were
arrested
pursuant
to
arrest
warrants
and
these
weapons
and
arms
and
arsenal
were
seized
pursuant
to
search
warrants
signed
by
a
supreme
court
justice
particularly
describing
what
was
to
be
seized
the
following
morning,
june
21st.
now,
two
indictments
were
handed
up
by
this
grand
jury
as
a
result
of
the
testimony
and
their
testimony
consists
of
a
151
pages
and
i
offered
it
to
the
court
on
two
occasions,
the
first
time
i
argued
here
a
year
ago
and
no
action
was
taken.
these
minutes
of
the
grand
jury
unlike
harris
against
younger,
the
california
and
it
cannot
be
printed
in
records
and
are
not
printed
customarily
in
our
state
appellate
courts,
the
judges
asked
the
district
attorney
to
hand
up
a
copy
of
the
minutes
because
we
have
a
very
strict
rule
on
indictments
on
the
state
court.
the
rule
is
that
there
must
be
proof
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt
in
the
grand
jury
minutes
that
the
defendants
are
guilty
if
unexplained.
other
than
the
federal
courts
and
elsewhere
you
don't
need
that
quantum
of
proof
and
we
also
have
another
--
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
that
is
true
sir.
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
unexplained
and
further
than
that
in
people
against
jackson
and
people
against
pittsburgh,
our
state
court
of
appeals
has
imposed
another
rule
on
us
that
if
you
have
the
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
at
the
time
of
trial
but
you
didn't
have
it
at
the
time
of
the
accusation
before
the
grand
jury
then
that's
sufficient
to
justify
reversal
as
a
matter
of
law,
pittsburg
and
jackson.
so
--
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
yes.
so,
that
is
why
--
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
many
of
our
--
many
motions
are
made
attacking
our
indictments
on
the
insufficiency
of
the
evidence
before
the
grand
jury
and
i
regret
to
report
that
they
are
dismissed
because
the
judge
reads
the
minutes
and
says,
“i
don't
think
you've
made
a
case
up.”
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
none
on
the
felony
level.
the
state
--
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
--
constitution
requires
for
a
felony
indictment
by
a
grand
jury
can
even
be
waived
by
a
defendant.
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
non-waivable
by
a
defendant.
got
to
be
accused
by
a
cross
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
yes.
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
no,
by
decision
--
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
--
of
the
state
court
of
appeals
interpreting
the
constitution
of
the
state
that
requires
indictment
by
the
grand
jury
and
also
a
provision
of
the
code
of
criminal
procedure
of
the
state
of
new
york
that
requires
sufficient
proof
to
convict
at
trial
if
unexplained.
that's
the
words
of
the
statute.
now,
i
would
like
to
go
into
these
minutes
are
here
if
the
court
will
accept
them,
i'll
hand
them
to
the
marshall.
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
yes.
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
yes,
your
honor,
otherwise
it
will
be
reversed.
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
that's
the
highest
court
of
the
state
in
two
cases,
people
against
jackson
and
people
against
pittsburg.
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
it
does
not,
your
honor.
it
merely
is
done
by
the
legislature
of
new
york
in
the
current
code
of
criminal
procedure.
but
it
has
been
there
for
many
years.
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
now,
in
this
indictment,
we
have
a
--
we
could've
had
a
131
indictments
here
if
we
were
proceeding
strictly
according
to
the
common
law
which
required
a
single
crime
and
a
single
defendant
for
each
indictment.
but
again,
our
code
of
criminal
procedure
and
those
sections
are
set
forth
at
page
8
and
9
of
my
brief
on
re-argument
and
also
the
original
briefs,
allows
us
to
combine
defendants
and
charges
in
one
indictment
provided
we
separately
number
each
crime
in
account.
and
that
provision
appears
in
section
279
of
the
code
of
criminal
procedure
and
the
reason
i
make
mention
of
it
is
this
at
this
stage,
because
we
have
combined
here,
in
one
indictment,
the
indictment
now
before
the
court,
15
defendants
and
48
counts.
we
could've
had
111
different
indictments
and
then
moved
to
consolidate
them
on
the
grounds
that
would
come
in
issues.
the
test
for
putting
these
counts
in
one
indictment
is
there
are
four
different
circumstances
in
279.
the
one
of
the
four
that
we
selected
is
where
the
crimes
charged
are
connected
together
and
are
part
of
a
common
scheme
or
plan.
now,
by
a
motion
before
the
appellate
court,
you
can
sever
this
indictment.
but
before
the
trial
court,
these
indictments
could
be
severed.
now,
these
things
then
are
by
law,
by
the
lore
of
pleading
in
criminal
matters
of
our
state
interrelated
charges.
i
want
to
also
say
that
in
these
48
counts,
the
first
four
of
them
deal
with
criminal
anarchy
and
charged
all
the
defendants
with
the
commission
of
that
crime.
but
the
first
three
deals
with
criminal
anarchy
and
the
fourth
is
conspiracy
to
commit
criminal
action.
now,
the
others
--
the
other
counts
in
the
indictment
have
nothing
to
do
with
criminal
anarchy
but
are
there
because
they're
interrelated
with
the
ultimate
purpose
of
this
indictment.
count
five
is
a
conspiracy
to
commit
arson
in
the
third
degree.
it
does
not
--
that
count
is
not
charged
against
everybody.
many
of
the
defendants
are
not
charged
with
that
missed
case.
count
six
permitting
--
the
count
seven
dealing
with
--
countsix
and
seven
deal
with
permitting
premises,
misdemeanor,
permitting
premises
to
be
used
for
anarchy.
the
remaining
counts,
41
and
all
deal
with
weapons.
now,
this
may
be
a
little
but
abstruse
but
it's
important
to
make
this
one
point
that
four
of
these
41
counts
that
deal
with
weapons,
deal
with
handguns
and
thirty
seven
deal
with
shoulder
guns.
under
the
weapons
law
of
new
york
which
i
told
this
court,
i
am
the
author
of
--
last
time,
mere
possession
of
a
hand
gun
in
four
of
these
41
counts
is
all
the
prosecution
has
to
establish
to
convict
of
a
crime
but
for
shoulder
guns,
rifles,
shotguns,
carbines,
you
need
proof
of
intent
to
use
unlawfully
against
another.
and
there's
a
good
reason
for
that.
a
lot
of
people
have
rifles
to
hunt
animals,
but
pistols
and
revolvers
and
automatic
weapons
normally
are
used
only
to
hunt
other
human
beings.
the
only
proof
of
intent
to
use
unlawfully
against
another
we
have
for
this
indictment
and
the
only
evidence
that
was
before
the
grand
jury
at
the
time
the
case
was
presented
was
the
intent
to
paralyze
and
overthrow
local
government.
consequently,
when
counsel
says
that
you
can
--
you
can't
when
irreparable
injury
is
done,
grave
and
immediate
because
of
the
possibility
of
concurrent
sentences
in
this
case.
that
is
not
so
and
i
will
demonstrate
why
its
not
because
there
are
first
of
all
four
defendants
in
this
case
who
are
not
charged
with
possession
of
weapon,
i
amend
that
there
were
five
who
are
not
charged
with
possession
of
weapons,
harriet
knoll,
raymond
smith,
fernandez,
ms.
west,
and
stan
--
max
stanford.
those
five
are
not
charged
with
any
possession
of
weapons
in
this
indictment,
it
isn't
because
they
didn't
posses
weapons
but
because
when
these
search
warrants
were
executed,
they
were
not
found
in
possession
of
the
weapons.
therefore,
these
five
people,
of
these
five
people
three
of
them
are
charged
with
no
anarchy
crimes
at
all.
so
in
these
five
cases
that
are
charged,
pardon
me,
with
no
non-anarchy
crimes.
so
in
these
--
three
of
these
five
cases,
we
have
persons
who
could
be
convicted
only
of
anarchy
connected
crimes
and
not
of
any
correlative
crimes
and
the
doctrine
of
concurrent
sentences
would
not
apply.
i
--
if
i
am
not
mistaken,
if
i
--
as
i
read
benton
against
maryland,
this
court
last
term
abandoned
the
concurrent
sentence
doctrine
anyway
so
that
the
reason
for
this
position
of
epton
no
longer
holds.
but
many
can
--
in
any
case
we
have
three
persons
that
could
be
convicted
solely
of
this
anarchy
connected
crimes
under
this
indictment
and
would
have
full
opportunity
to
bring
the
question
of
the
validity
of
the
new
york
statute
before
this
court.
by
the
way
the
new
york
statute
that
we're
talking
about
has
then
repealed
by
section
--
by
action
of
the
legislature
on
july
20th,
1965,
that's
five
years,
almost
five
years
ago.
the
repeal
was
to
take
effect
on
september
1st,
1967.
this
was
in
connection
with
an
entire
revision
of
the
new
york
penal
law.
now,
and
a
new
anarchy
section
was
substituted
on
july
20th,
1965.
now,
so
far
as
this
indictment
is
concerned,
it
was
handed
down
we
say
originally
in
--
on
june
20th,
1967.
the
court
of
appeals
--
the
epton
case
began
in
july
of
1964.
epton
was
tried
in
june
of
1965
and
convicted.
the
--
he
didn't
get
through
with
the
first
intermediate
appellate
court
until
december
of
1966.
and
the
highest
court
of
the
state
came
down
with
their
decision
in
epton
on
may
16th,
1967,
one
month
and
four
days
before
the
grand
jury
indicted
the
persons
in
this
case.
now,
it
is
true
that
some
of
the
acts
for
which
these
people
are
accused
took
place
prior
to
the
announcement
of
the
decision
in
epton.
but
there
is
one
other
unusual
feature
of
our
weapons
law
in
new
york
and
that
is
the
amnesty
features.
and
under
the
amnesty
feature,
any
person
at
that
time
if
they
had
read
epton,
when
it
come
down
on
may
16th
and
were
following
the
law
as
closely
as
counsel
seems
to
suppose
they
would
come
into
a
police
station
during
the
month
of
june,
today
they
can
come
in
during
any
month
and
hand
over
these
guns
with
amnesty
and
immunity
given
by
the
legislature.
that
is
section
1900,
subdivision
(a)
(1)
of
the
former
new
york
penal
law
enforced
in
effect
at
the
time
this
indictment
came
down.
this
is
a
defense
of
recantation
and
amnesty
given
by
new
york.
so
if
these
people
were
being
guided
by
what
the
highest
court
of
this
--
of
the
state
said
on
may
16th,
they
could
have
recant
it,
turned
in
thereof
with
impunity.
and
believe
me
there
would
be
no
indictment
in
this
case
if
all
we
had
is
what
appears
in
the
appendix
in
harris
against
younger
namely
statements
or
pamphlets
or
speeches
or
abstract
advocacy
of
the
doctrine
of
anarchy.
what
we're
concerned
with
was
in
this
case,
the
amassing
of
an
arsenal
for
the
purpose
of
paralyzing
and
overthrowing
government.
now,
this
court
in
its
most
recent
pronouncement
on
the
question
of
free
speech,
brandenburg
at
the
last
term
on
june
9th
say
that
you
may
punish
a
person
for
advocacy,
for
words
provided
it's
accompanied
by
inciting
and
producing
lawless
action
and
there
is
probable
cause
that
that
lawless
action
would
occur.
now,
the
minutes
of
the
grand
jury
which
are
here
before
this
court
show
that
they
assembled
9000
rounds
of
ammunition.
they
assembled
cans
of
gasoline,
cans
of
oil,
intending
to
burn
the
subways,
the
power
plant,
the
lumber
yards,
the
tire
factories,
public
communications
facilities
in
queens
county
and
they
had
a
detailed
blue
print
and
a
timetable
for
the
execution
of
this
plan.
the
speech
involved
in
this
case,
the
advocacy
only
the
--
is
the
mortise
and
tenon,
the
cement,
the
binding
quality
to
put
these
acts
for
overthrow
together.
as
a
matter
of
fact
on
16th,
there
was
a
dry
run
in
which
these
weapons
were
used
against
some
stores
in
the
jamaica
section
of
queens,
the
testimony
before
the
grand
jury
so
revealed.
and
it's
set
forth
in
my
brief.
bazookas
--
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
we
did
not
yet
bring
them
to
trial
out
of
deference
to
this
court,
your
honor.
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
we
wanted
to
give
this
tribunal
a
chance
also
for
the
trial
--
for
the
guidance
of
the
trial
judge.
may
i
say
this,
--
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
no
stay
has
ever
been
issued
for
--
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
--
but
it
was
agreed
that
if
there
is
a
question,
let
the
federal
tribunals
dispose
of
it.
we
have
in
a
second
indictment
convicted
two
of
these
appellants
in
this
case,
ferguson
and
harris.
they
were
convicted
of
conspiring
to
murder
whitney
young
and
roy
wilkins.
they
had
other
people
on
the
list
as
well
but
they
were
the
first
two.
they
had
a
trial
before
a
jury.
the
intermediate
appellate
court,
five
judges
found
unanimously
that
there
was
sufficient
evidence
to
convict
but
three
judge
--
two
judges
dissented
of
the
five
on
the
grounds
that
because
senator
robert
kennedy
whose
name
was
also
on
the
list
to
be
killed
was
mentioned
at
a
time
when
he
was
lying
between
life
and
death
that
a
new
trial
should
be
granted
or
the
judge
should've
granted
a
continuance.
the
highest
court
of
our
state,
seven
judges
found
identically,
unanimously
that
there
was
sufficient
evidence
to
convict
them
of
conspiracy
to
commit
murder
in
the
first
degree
and
--
but
they
also
agreed,
three
of
them
agreed
that
maybe
the
trial
judge
should've
granted
a
continuance
of
that
--
on
the
count
of
the
circumstance
of
the
assassination
of
president
kennedy.
i'd
like
to
say
this
in
connection
with
the
question
of
the
section
2291
--
the
2283.
for
177
years,
we've
had
that
statute
on
the
books.
march
2nd,
1793
and
never
once
has
this
court
in
anyway
said
that
a
lower
court,
that's
a
creature
of
congress,
must
not
observe
that
statute.
for
99
years
since
1781,
we
had
the
provisions
of
section
1983,
the
so-called
civil
rights
act
which
gives
a
person
a
cause
of
action,
an
action
at
law,
a
suit
and
equity
or
other
problem,
means
of
redress
if
any
rights,
privileges
or
immunities
guaranteed
to
him
by
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
are
taken
away
from
him
under
color
of
state
law,
never
in
99
years
has
this
court
ever
held
that
that
constitutes
the
word,
the
three
words
suit
in
equity
constitutes
and
exception
to
1983.
now,
recently
this
court
has
taken
up
this
question,
they
took
it
up
in
dombrowski
against
pfister
ad
very
carefully
justice
brennan
in
writing
that
opinion
observe
the
restrictions
of
the
act
of
1793.
and
justice
harlan
in
his
first
footnote
in
his
dissenting
opinion
also
called
the
attention
of
the
court
that
if
there
had
been
an
action
pending
at
the
time
of
application
to
the
federal
court
then
of
course
this
court
could
not
reverse
any
--
could
not
just
authorize
intervention
below.
again
it
came
up
in
several
other
cases,
cameron
against
johnson
is
a
good
illustration
from
mississippi,
came
up
from
mississippi
and
were
sent
back
by
this
court
to
the
district
court
in
the
southern
district
of
mississippi
to
have
them
determine
whether
2283
was
a
bar
and
the
district
court
of
mississippi,
three-judge
district
court
came
back
and
said
yes,
we
think
the
suit
is
barred
by
2283
and
this
court
affirmed.
but
there
was
a
footnote
by
justice
douglas
where
he
said,
“well,
we
don't
have
to
decide
the
question
of
2283.”
but
still
this
court
did
affirm
the
determination
of
the
district
court
of
mississippi.
again
in
brooks
against
briley
from
tennessee,
same
thing,
district
court
there,
three-judge
district
court
said,
“you
can't
get
by
here
with
2283.”
can't
get
by
--
“no,
can
you
get
by
on
the
companion
declaratory
judgment.”
a
case
came
up
to
the
supreme
court
affirmed.
this
are
all
very
recent
cases
all
involving
1983
as
an
exception
to
2283.
again
in
zwickler
against
boll
coming
from
wisconsin,
same
result,
this
court's
affirming,
the
district
court's
denying.
so
the
most
recent
authority
in
this
court
is
that
2283
is
hurdle.
now
you
have
two
hurdles
to
surmount
before
we
can
get
to
the
question
of
free
speech.
you
have
two
hurdles
to
surmount.
one,
you
got
to
get
by
this
historic
barrier
of
congress
since
1793,
you've
got
to
surmount
that
hurdle
before
you
can
go
anywhere
else.
the
26
words
that
were
put
in
amending
the
parent
statute,
the
judiciary
act
of
1789,
26
words
have
to
be
observed.
now,
this
court
has
repeatedly
said
in
1941,
they
said
in
the
natuzzi
case,
we
must
be
scrupulous,
must
be
scrupulous
about
the
bound
--
the
meets
and
bounds
that
congress
sets
for
courts
of
their
own
creation,
must
be
scrupulous.
then
in
1948,
when
congress
codified
three
exceptions,
in
1951,
this
court
revisited
once
again
the
statute
of
1793
and
at
that
time
they
said,
you
got
to
go
by
those
three
exceptions
of
congress
and
you
can't
go
any
further.
now,
there's
another
consideration
involved
here,
it
interrupted
and
stayed
in
the
federal
prosecution.
and
that
is
that
this
tribunal
which
is
a
constitutional
tribunal,
is
not
a
circuit
court
or
a
(audio
static)
constitution
yet
congress
in
fixing
which
they
have
the
power
to
do
in
article
3,
section
2,
the
appellate
jurisdiction
of
this
court
carefully
requires
that
there'd
be
a
final
judgment
of
a
state
tribunal
and
a
decision
by
the
highest
court
in
which
a
decision
can
be
had
before
state
action
may
be
reviewed
by
this,
a
constitutional
tribunal.
how
can
we
then
say
that
this
court
is
going
by
statutory
interpretation,
this
isn't
a
constitutional
question,
if
to
lower
federal
courts,
a
power
it
does
not
even
arrogate
to
its
self?
why
congress
has
the
power
unless
this
court
wants
to
overrule
ex
parte
mccarthy.
congress
has
the
power
to
take
this
case
right
away
from
this
court
now
by
taking
away
appellate
jurisdiction
over
any
questions,
let's
say
of
denial
of
injunctions
by
three-judge
courts
below.
unless
we
overrule
ex
parte
mccarthy
which
involves
free
speech,
which
involve
free
speech
that
would
be
the
result.
now,
i
believe
as
far
as
speech
is
concerned
--
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
to
take
away
jurisdiction
from
this
court,
your
honor?
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
it
would
be
a
--
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
it
would
be
--
i
don't
advocate
it
by
any
means,
i'm
not
advocating
that
the
appellate
jurisdiction
of
this
constitutional
court
ever
be
tampered
with
congress
but
i
see
--
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
--
this
court
has
sustained
in
the
past.
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
yes.
well,
i'd
say
that
this
suit
in
equity
in
1983
is
just
those
words,
there
were
three
phrases,
action
at
lawsuit
and
equity
or
rather
a
proper
proceeding
for
redress.
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
yes,
but
the
cases
which
this
court
says
are
exceptions
where
the
federal
court
can
enjoin
are
there
are
a
quite
a
number.
in
1851,
a
ship
owner
who
deposits
a
money
equal
to
the
debt
can
relieve
a
lien
against
this
ship.
in
1875,
a
bankruptcy
exception
was
allowed
namely
that
all
proceedings
in
state
as
well
as
federal
courts
will
be
stayed.
several
other
exceptions
have
been
allowed
by
congress
to
the
state.
they
allow
it
in
connection
with
the
frazier-lemke
farm
mortgage
act
during
the
depression
in
1930's.
the
state
collection
proceeding.
they
have
allowed
it
in
the
famous
habeas
of
our
immemorial
habeas
corpus
act,
federal
habeas
corpus
act,
they
can
stop
all
proceedings
in
a
state
court.
they
allow
it
and
the
interpleader
act.
but
in
all
of
these
cases
as
this
court
said
in
amalgamated
clothing
workers
against
richman
in
1951
after
the
amendment,
in
all
of
these
cases,
the
language
that
congress
used
is
pretty
explicit.
it
doesn't
have
to
refer
to
1983
by
number.
but
it
has
to
be
pretty
explicit
and
stay
--
say
that
proceedings
may
be
stayed
either
in
a
state
court
or
in
any
court
or
it
may
say
that
all
proceedings
shall
cease
wherever
they
are.
they
use
a
collocation
of
words
quite
different
than
merely
a
suit
in
equity.
now
a
suit
in
equity
can
be
brought
for
a
lot
of
things
as
your
honors
well
knows,
a
bill
quia
timet,
an
action
for
recession
of
a
contract,
a
lot
of
suits
in
equity
can
be
brought
without
resorting
to
a
stay
or
an
injunction.
injunction
isn't
the
only
type
of
equitable
remedy.
second,
a
suit
in
equity
can
be
brought
in
a
state
court
and
the
state
court
could
grant
a
stay
without
running
into
the
federal
court.
and
third
and
this
is
important,
the
suit
in
equity
can
be
brought
even
to
stay,
a
threatened
procedure
proceeding
in
the
state
court.
and
in
that
respect,
our
case,
this
is
the
most
restrictive
interpretation,
the
most
limiting
interpretation
on
19
--
on
2283,
ex
parte
young
of
course
tells
us
that
the
--
the
memorial
--
the
memorable
congressional
statute
requires
that
the
proceeding
be
in
a
state
court
and
if
it
is
not
in
a
state
court
then
of
course
its
possible
to
get
an
injunction
against
a
threatened
prosecution.
now,
this
court
has
seven
related
cases
involving
injunctions
by
three
--
either
denial
or
granting
of
injunctions
by
the
three-judge
district
courts
below.
the
first
case,
number
4,
harris
against
younger,
in
that
case
the
court
--
the
three-judge
court
did
grant
an
injunction
and
one
of
the
three
applicants
for
the
injunction,
harris,
had
an
indictment
pending
against
him.
there
you
have
a
question
of
a
clear
cut
violation
of
the
provisions
of
2283
in
connection
with
the
other
two
applicants,
broslawsky,
dan
and
hirsch,
nobody
indicted
them.
and
our
interpretation
of
2283
is
that
so
far
as
enjoining
the
district
attorney
if
los
angeles
county
from
commencing
a
prosecution
against
professor
broslawsky
or
the
labor
union
leaders,
dan
and
hirsch,
that
2283
doesn't
effect
because
there
was
no
proceeding
in
a
state
court.
boyle
against
landry
as
i
understand
it,
there
was
no
pending
case
in
the
state
court
so
i'm
question
--
i
question
whether
2283
has
any
application
there.
in
our
case
we
had
indictments,
this
indictment
pending
in
a
state
court
for
265
days
with
58,
59,
60
motions
made
before
application
was
made
to
the
federal
tribunal.
next
case
after
this
gone
--
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
these
indictments
were
returned
on
june
20th,
1967
your
honor.
that's
--
and
application
was
made
--
the
first
indictments
--
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
--
the
superseding
indictment
january
20th,
1968,
march
12th,
1968,
application
first
made
for
the
first
time
to
a
federal
district
court.
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
about
june,
i
don't
have
the
exact
date
at
the
moment,
june
1968,
your
honor,
june
1968.
this
case
was
ordered,
reargued
that
may
account
for
it.
the
next
case
gunn
against
university
committee
is
not
yet
argued
yet.
again,
there
you
had
no
pending
prosecution
because
the
state
tribunal
had
dismissed
it.
dyson
against
bachelor
(ph)
--
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
about
june
of
1968
and
this
case
--
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
no,
injunction
was
denied.
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
i
--
we
did
prosecute
two
of
these
men
and
--
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
the
reason
is
that
they
--
it
was
agreed
that
the
gist
--
well,
to
be
very
honest,
an
assistant
district
attorney
in
our
office
agreed
with
other
side
without
my
knowing
about
it
and
without
district
attorney
mackell
who
is
here
in
court
knowing
about
it.
that
he
would
await
the
outcome
of
the
decision
from
this
tribunal.
that's
why.
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
when
it
had
--
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
--
and
was
--
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
on
the
conspiracy
to
commit
murder
in
a
separate
--
the
second,
the
separate
indictment.
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
and
they
were
convicted
in
june,
the
month
that
--
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
--
that
senator
kennedy
was
assassinated.
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
conspiracy
to
commit
murder.
they're
also
involved
in
this
--
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
of
two
named
persons.
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
we
had
two
indictments
based
on
the
same
grand
jury
managed
mr.
chief
justice.
one
was
the
present
indictment
involving
the
15
defendants.
the
other
was
against
two
defendants
who
are
also
included
in
these
15.
the
second
indictment
was
to
conspiracy
to
commit
murder
in
the
first
degree.
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
we
proceeded
and
tried
them
because
no
application
was
made
to
a
federal
tribunal.
they
were
convicted
and
they
--
that
case
is
now
pending
in
this
court
for
certiorari
under
1668
miscellaneous.
it's
on
your
docket.
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
the
charges
in
the
first
indictment
where
the
possession
of
these
weapons
and
41
of
its
48
counts
conspiracy
to
commit
arson
in
one
of
the
48
counts
--
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
there
were
41
separate
weapons.
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
that's
right.
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
yes,
your
honor.
under
the
law
of
the
state
of
new
york.
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
for
10
of
the
15
appellants
in
this
case.
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
i
can't
in
one
indictment
proceed
against
you
under
certain
counts
and
let
the
rest
hang
in
advance.
i
can't
sever
it.
our
state
courts
will
--
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
because
they'll
regard
that
as
double
jeopardy,
they'll
say
jeopardy
attaches
if
you
go
ahead
with
one
count
in
an
indictment
and
dispose
of
it
by
conviction,
you
can
never
prosecute
for
the
others.
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
we
did
not
anticipate
at
the
time
this
indictment
was
returned
that
there
will
be
any
resort
to
the
federal
court.
this
is
a
supers
--
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
i
wouldn't
want
to
amend
--
to
put
this
case
in
before
a
grand
jury
again
while
it's
pending
in
a
federal
tribunal.
i
think
that
would
be
a
little
unfair.
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
because
i
think
it
would
frustrate
--
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
they
are,
there's
no
question
about
it
but
--
may
i
add
also
but
i
do
not
want
to
prejudice
any
of
these
appellants.
some
of
these
appellants
in
matters
did
--
not
connected
with
criminal
anarchy,
are
under
pending
indictments
in
our
county
alone.
so
we
have
a
rope
around
them.
i
may
add
this
too
if
i
may
that
this
type
of
interruption
of
a
state
criminal
proceeding
does
not
give
the
state
the
opportunity
to
refine
the
charges
in
the
indictment.
now,
in
the
most
re
--
brandenburg
case,
this
court
pointed
out
that
there
was
no
refinement
of
the
charge
in
that
case
either
by
the
trial
judge
or
by
the
highest
court
of
the
state
of
ohio.
in
our
case
there
are
many
more
stages
of
refinement
that
this
proceeding
has
interrupted.
for
example,
at
page
89
of
the
appendix
to
my
brief,
section
295,
i
think
it
is
(g)
of
the
code
of
criminal
procedure,
says
mandatorily
in
the
form
of
the
indictment
that
we
used
which
is
a
short
form
indictment,
mandatorily
the
district
attorney
shall
deliver
a
bill
of
particulars
to
the
defendant
provided
he
applies
to
the
judge
for
one.
the
first
stage
of
refinement
is
that
we
would
have
to
particularize
what
we
rely
on
to
convict
this
defendant
and
we
must
do
so
mandatorily.
it's
not
in
the
discretion
of
a
judge,
state
court
judge
to
deny
a
bill
of
particulars.
second,
at
the
trial
of
this
case,
the
trial
judge
will
have
to
give
instructions
to
the
jury.
at
that
time
he
can
clearly
state
and
incorporate
anything
that
has
been
laid
down
by
this
court
in
brandenburg
and
by
the
highest
court
of
our
state
in
epton.
third,
the
highest
court
of
the
state
will
reveal
this
conviction
and
we're
reminded
in
--
that
1947
case
coming
from
new
york
county
against
new
york,
the
opinion
by
justice
reed,
the
name,
it
forgets
me,
i
worked
on
the
case
myself.
that
if
the
highest
court
of
a
state
amends
a
statute
by
construing
it
then
those
words
of
the
highest
court
of
the
state
must
be
taken
to
be
part
of
the
state
statute
itself.
thank
you.
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
just
because
you're
attempting
to
overthrow
the
government,
it
seems
to
me
does
not
give
you
a
broader
privilege
to
use
force
than
if
you're
committing
an
ordinary
crime
of
robbery.
now,
as
between
robbery
and
criminal
anarchy,
there
is
this
distinction,
if
a
robber
sets
out
and
succeeds
in
getting
the
loot,
taking
it
from
a
crime,
he
is
not
home
free
because
he
may
later
be
apprehended
and
put
in
jail.
but
if
an
anarchist
overthrows
the
local
government,
sets
out
to
do
it
and
succeeds,
then
he
is
home
free.
there's
an
epigram
from
sir
john
harington
in
the
17th
century,
it's
just
two
lines,
he
says,
“treason
doth
never
succeed.
what's
the
reason?
for
if
treason
succeed,
none
dare
call
it
treason.”
in
other
words,
the
person
who
succeeds
in
overthrowing
the
government
has
bought
themselves
amnesty
and
immunity.
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
proceeding
in
the
state
court,
state
of
new
york,
county
of
queens,
queens
is
one
of
62
counties
in
new
york
state,
its
part
of
new
york
city,
has
a
population
of
about
five
--
two
million.
it's
the
fifth
largest
county
in
the
united
states.
it
began
so
far
as
i
know
with
an
investigation
by
the
police
of
the
city
of
new
york
in
october
of
1965
that
was
two
years
--
a
year
and
several
months
before
we
were
in
office
in
the
district
attorney
of
queens
county.
it
stemmed
from
activity
of
the
flq,
a
quebec
revolutionary
organization
which
attempted
to
blowup
the
statue
of
liberty
and
resulted
in
three
convictions.
for
some
reason,
the
police
continued
their
investigation
with
this
group
in
queens
and
this
investigation
went
into
the
black
brother
improvement
society.
several
undercover
men
from
new
york
city
police
were
assigned.
one
of
them
became
a
member,
a
member
of
the
board
of
directors,
vice-president
and
was
in
on
all
high
conspiracies.
nobody
came
to
the
district
attorney
from
the
police
until
april
of
1967,
and
at
that
time
they
indicated
how
things
had
progressed.
they
have
progressed
beyond
the
mere
advocacy,
the
naked
advocacy
of
overthrowing
of
local
establishment.
they
had
reached
the
point
where
they
had
accumulated
weapons,
cans
of
gasoline,
cans
of
oil,
black
powder
to
explode,
blueprints,
and
had
designated
areas
that
were
to
be
blown
up.
they
had
even
devised
a
timetable,
they
had
engaged
in
training
programs
for
the
use
of
these
things.
even
then,
the
district
attorney
did
not
move
until
they
held
a
dry
run
that
wasn't
so
dry
because
four
shots
were
fired
in
the
jamaica
section
of
queens
on
june
16,
1967.
furthermore,
they
had
now
formulated
and
made
definite
a
second
conspiracy
that
involved
only
three
people,
ferguson,
harris,
and
this
undercover
policeman
and
this
conspiracy
was
to
kill
two
moderate
civil
rights
leaders,
whitney
young
and
roy
wilkins,
they
had
gone
quite
far,
they
had
already
acquired
the
weapons,
they
had
devised
the
plan,
they
had
cased
roy
wilkins
house
who
unfortunately
lived
in
a
sort
of
cul-de-sac
about
a
mile
from
the
courthouse
in
queens.
now
we
then
proceeded
and
presented
this
case
to
a
grand
jury.
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
this
--
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
this
was
presented
to
the
grand
jury
on
june
20,
1967
and
we
have
nothing
in
the
record
on
these
facts.
this
court
is
forced
to
rely
on
my
say-so
and
that's
because
of
this
anticipatory
nature
of
reveal
with
one
exception.
we
presented
the
matter
to
the
grand
jury
and
it
was
no
special
grand
jury.
it
was
an
ordinary
grand
jury.
i
just
happened
to
be
sitting
that
day
on
june
20th
and
they
returned
two
indictments.
and
i'll
dispose
of
one
of
those
indictments
because
this
court
has
already
done
so
on
june
29th
of
this
year.
and
that
was
the
indictment
of
ferguson
and
harris
who
are
two
of
the
appellants
here.
ferguson
and
harris
were
charged
with
conspiracy
to
commit
murder
in
the
first
degree
against
whitney
young
and
roy
wilkins.
they
were
brought
to
trial
on
a
superseded
indictment
that
was
returned
in
february
of
1968
on
this
judge
before
a
judge
and
jury.
they
were
convicted
in
june
of
1968.
they
went
through
two
appellate
courts
and
unanimously
12
appellate
judges
in
new
york,
5
from
the
appellate
division
and
7
from
the
court
of
appeals
found
there
was
proof
and
sufficient
proof
all
the
way
through,
beyond
a
unreasonable
doubt
there
were
some
dissents
over
whether
a
continuance
shouldn't
have
been
granted
in
that
trial.
they
applied
for
certiorari
to
this
court
and
there
you
did
have
trial
record
to
review
and
this
court
denied
certiorari
on
june
29th.
there
is
just
this
minor
appendix.
justice
holly
continued
these
two
on
bail
until
this
court
dispose
off
their
application
for
review.
they
have
not
surrendered
since
june
29th.
they
have
been
indicted
for
jumping
bail
in
the
first
degree.
they
may
be
in
algeria
right
now.
and
yet
we
have
counsel
here
asking
this
court
to
review
an
equitable
determination
below
when
two
of
the
persons
they
represent
in
a
single
petition
are
coming
in
to
say
the
least
with
unclean
hands.
the
questions
now
before
this
court,
is
not
an
accusation
by
the
district
attorney
mackell
or
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
new
york.
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
new
york
had
nothing.
whatever
they
do
with
this
case,
mr.
mackell
did
not
present
it
to
the
grand
jury.
what
they
are
complaining
about
is
an
indictment
by
a
grand
jury
in
new
york
and
that
grand
jury
consisted
of
22
persons
on
june
20
of
1967.
it
was
the
same
grand
jury
that
superseded
its
first
indictment
on
june
15,
1968.
now
what
does
an
indictment
mean
in
new
york?
in
new
york,
an
indictment
means
that
you
must
--
the
new
york
state
constitution,
article
i,
section
6
has
the
identical
words
of
its
opening
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment
of
the
federal
constitution
that
“nobody
is
going
to
stand
trial
except
on
indictment
or
presentment
of
a
grand
jury”.
but
the
new
york
legislature
has
been
much
stricter
about
that
requirement
than
has
congress
or
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure.
the
new
york
legislature
says
that
no
indictment
can
be
amended
and
that
even
if
a
person
when
he
is
first
arrested
comes
in
and
pleads
guilty
his
plea
is
a
nullity
because
he
can
not
plead
to
a
felony
unless
he
has
been
indicted
and
accused
by
a
grand
jury.
moreover,
his
lawyer
cannot
come
in
and
say,
“we'll
waive
the
indictment.
let's
plead
out
to
something
else.”
not
permitted
in
new
york
and
i
don't
have
this
in
my
brief,
i
just
make
the
brief
reference
to
people
ex
rel.
wachowicz
against
martin,
293
n.y.
361.
this
is
the
procedure
in
new
york.
now
what
quantum
of
proof
is
required
before
a
grand
jury
in
new
york?
we
have
costello
against
the
united
states,
a
case
decided
by
this
court
10,
12
years
ago
where
they
said
a
grand
jury
--
a
federal
grand
jury
can
indict
on
hearsay,
pure
100%
hearsay.
the
testimony
of
an
accountant
in
an
income
tax
rebate
investigation,
100%
hearsay
that's
a
sufficient
indictment
in
the
federal
court.
by
statute,
section
249
of
our
code
of
criminal
procedure
provides
that
the
grand
jury
can
receive
none
but
legal
evidence.
section
251
of
the
same
code
says
that
the
grand
jury
cannot
indict
unless
the
evidence
before
it
if
unexplained
or
uncontradicted
would
be
sufficient
to
warrant
a
trial
jury
to
convict.
finally,
section
389
of
the
same
code
by
statute
proscribes
the
standard
of
proof
for
a
trial
jury
and
it
provides
that
the
defendant
is
presumed
to
be
innocent
and
if
there
is
any
reasonable
doubt
about
whether
he
is
guilt
is
satisfactory
shown,
he
is
entitled
to
an
acquittal.
those
are
the
standards
that
apply
to
the
grand
jury.
beyond
that,
22
people
on
the
grand
jury
found
this
proof
beyond
unreasonable
doubt
in
coming
down
with
this
48-count
indictment.
now
beyond
that,
you
are
entitled
to
judicial
review
with
the
trial
court
level
about
what
the
grand
jury
does.
and
here
apparently,
the
legislature
has
been
very
liberal
in
conferring
upon
one
supreme
court,
state
supreme
court
justice
enormous
power
over
the
grand
jury.
in
section
671,
it
says
that
regardless
of
whether
the
defendant
makes
a
motion
or
not,
if
the
judge
thinks
in
furtherance
of
justice
this
indictment
should
be
set
aside.
he
has
the
power
to
do
it.
now
these
applications
had
been
made
under
the
superseded
indictment
and
they
have
been
denied
by
several
judges
on
the
state
court
level.
now
that's
how
far
this
case
has
proceeded
in
the
state
courts.
this
case
was
in
the
state
courts
from
june
20,
1967
until
march
12,
1968
when
application
was
made
to
the
three-judge
court.
now
it
has
been
in
the
federal
courts
for
979
days
counting
today,
979
days.
now
there
are
two
facets
to
this
case
and
i
think
they
stand
from
ex
parte
young
and
justice
brennan's
opinion
in
dombrowski
and
as
dombrowski
laid
down.
first
of
all,
this
is
anticipatory
federal
relief,
expediting
federal
relief.
judge
brennan,
i
think
says,
if
you
have
a
statute
that's
overbroad
or
vague
on
its
face
or
if
there
is
bad
faith
in
applying
a
statute
that
might
otherwise
be
valid
on
either
of
those
grounds
in
dombrowski.
justice
brennan
said
the
federal
courts
may
grant
anticipatory
relief
as
they
did
in
ex
parte
young
on
a
question
of
economic
due
process.
later
justice
brennan
in
cameron
2
in
1968
seemed
to
say
that
dombrowski
rested
primarily
on
the
second
of
those
two
horns
and
he
said
that
i
think
--
and
he
referred
to
the
facts
in
dombrowski,
where
there
had
been
arrest
where
there
had
been
raids,
where
had
been
seizure
of
materials
under
some
communist
control
act,
and
these
has
all
been
quashed
by
the
state
courts
in
louisiana.
and
not
withstanding
that,
the
state
legislative
committee
under
pfister
and
other
people
continued
the
investigation
and
that
was
the
sign
of
bad
faith
so
far
as
state
action
was
concerned.
now
in
this
case,
i
don't
think
you
can
come
in
on
the
first
of
the
two
grounds
in
dombrowski
for
several
reasons.
first
of
all
in
epton,
which
was
decided
on
may
16,
1967,
this
indictment,
june
20,
1967,
a
month
and
five
days
later.
epton
qualified
narrowing
the
construction
of
the
old
criminal
anarchy
statute
in
new
york
that
had
been
upheld
by
the
way
in
gitlow
against
new
york.
there
had
been
a
prior
prosecution
on
writ
1922.
in
upholding
it,
they
said,
“first
of
all,
the
mere
advocacy
of
criminal
anarchy
is
out.”
the
court
of
appeals
said.
second,
they
said,
“you
not
only
have
to
advocate
the
overthrow
of
government
but
you
have
to
have
an
impact
to
overthrow
the
government
that
must
accompany
that
advocacy.”
and
third,
they
said,
“there
has
to
be
clear
and
present
danger.”
everywhere
in
this
indictment
that
we
talked
about,
those
first
four
counts,
criminal
anarchy,
everywhere
we
talked
about
that
in
this
indictment,
we
shrink
it
down
to
the
very
narrowest
possible
dimensions.
we
identified
the
general
targets
as
the
state
of
new
york
or
the
political
subdivisions
of
the
state
or
the
executive
officials
of
the
state.
we
identified
particular
targets
in
there
as
publicly-owned
and
operated
transportation
facilities
in
the
city
of
new
york
and
publicly
and
streets,
manholes
of
the
city
of
new
york
with
plans,
detailed
blueprints
to
pour
gasoline
had
already
been
made
and
we
identified
the
means.
every
time
we
allege
these
things
in
this
pleading
before
the
court,
we
identified
the
means
as
force
and
violence
to
wit
the
use
of
bombs,
shotguns,
rifles,
gasoline,
gunpowder,
etcetera,
all
the
way
through.
consequently,
i
don't
see
how
when
this
court
considered
people
against
epton,
i
believe
in
january
of
1968,
both
appeal
and
certiorari
and
this
court
denied
review
of
people
against
epton.
justice
douglas
if
i
can
remember,
i
have
to
remember
back
in
writing
a
rather
lucid
dissent.
his
only
objection
if
i
can
recall
was
to
what
the
trial
judge
did
in
the
epton
case.
he
said
the
trial
judge
had
submitted
a
great
many
overt
acts
to
the
jury
and
some
of
those
overt
acts
were
in
the
area
of
protected
speech,
if
i
recall
justice
douglas's
dissent
from
the
denial
of
certiorari.
so
the
epton
case
has
already
been
narrowly
--
the
epton
case
has
narrowly
construed
the
statute.
now,
you
asked,
well,
what
about
the
bad
faith
in
this
case?
we
did
not
accuse
anybody
in
this
case.
none
of
the
15
defendants
were
accused
by
the
district,
neither
were
they
accused
by
this
grand
jury.
and
if
there
is
any
bad
faith,
the
bad
faith
lies
on
the
part
of
that
cross-section
of
the
community,
those
22
persons.
but
there
is
no
bad
faith
in
this
case.
any
question
about
publicity
has
been
reviewed
fully
by
the
state
courts
bellow
with
lengthy
opinions
written.
one
of
them
is
appended
in
my
brief
by
one
of
the
justices
on
the
state
court.
and
besides,
if
the
only
complaint
is
about
some
publicity,
remedies
lie
for
change
of
venue
with
the
time
of
trial
not
by
anticipatory
federal
relief.
we
are
asked
why
we
have
to
have
these
four
counts
relating
to
criminal
anarchy,
three
substantive
criminal
anarchy,
and
one
on
the
conspiracy
to
commit
criminal
anarchy,
which
is
a
misdemeanor.
and
i
have
previously
told
the
court
on
two
occasions
that
the
weapons
law
of
new
york
differentiates
between
handguns
and
shoulder
guns.
for
handguns,
mere
possession
is
alone
enough.
for
shoulder
guns,
you
must
prove
both
possession
and
intent
to
use
unlawful
guns
to
another.
37
of
41
of
the
counts
of
these
48
count
indictment
deal
with
that.
there's
a
second
reason
and
a
very
important
reason.
and
this
reason
goes
back
to
a
unanimous
opinion
of
this
court
written
by
justice
black,
cole
against
arkansas
where
he
said,
that
you
have
to
give
notice
in
advance
a
track
of
anything
you
intend
to
prove
at
that
trial.
we
would
necessarily
have
to
bring
in
this
conspiracy
to
overthrow
local
government
in
the
trial
for
the
possession
of
37
of
the
41
weapons
in
this
case.
if
you
remember
in
cole
against
arkansas,
the
defendant
was
charged
under
one
section
of
a
state
statute.
that
was
the
accusation.
he
was
tried
and
not
convicted
on
that
but
the
highest
court
of
arkansas
affirmed
this
conviction
another
section
of
the
statute.
they
found
there
was
sufficient
evidence
and
this
court
objected
and
the
opening
words
of
the
quote
that
i
have
in
mind
from
justice
black
was
that
there
is
nothing
more
fundamental
to
due
process
of
law
and
this
goes
back
to
(inaudible),
then
that
person
who
is
entitled
to
be
accused
in
advance.
we
had
a
case
in
queens
about
a
year
ago
where
three
murders
occurred.
it
was
a
division
of
spoils
of
a
robbery
that
was
committed
on
july
1,
1968.
on
july
4,
1968,
these
three
murders
among
the
thieves
had
occurred
and
there
were
indictments
for
murders,
but
no
indictment
for
robbery.
and
in
the
course
of
trying
this
case,
it
would
have
been
necessary
to
refer
to
the
fact
that
the
defendant
was
one
of
the
participants
in
this
robbery
and
that
there
was
a
dispute
over
the
spoils.
the
gasoline
station
owner
claimed
that
$11,000.00
have
been
taken
from
his
safe.
the
man
--
the
bad
man
among
the
robbers
had
only
$6,000.00.
so,
that
lead
to
the
murder
of
three
of
the
robbers.
but
because
it
was
necessary
to
refer
to
that
robbery
and
to
the
participation
of
these
persons
in
it,
an
indictment
was
filed
for
robbery
and
during
the
course
of
the
trial,
many
references
were
made
to
the
robbery
but
defense
counsel
could
not
stand
up
and
scream
that
they
had
never
been
accused
of
a
robbery.
nobody
had
ever
accused
them
of
robbery
and
that
is
the
reason
we
have
to
have
these
other
counts
in
the
indictment.
we
do
not
concede
as
mr.
rabinowitz
supposes
that
the
doctrine
of
abstention
ought
not
to
be
applied
here.
we
do
not
concede
that
at
all.
we
think
our
position
is
completely
consistent
with
dombrowski,
with
ex
parte
young
and
no
grounds
have
been
out
why
there
should
be
no
abstention
in
this
case.
the
major
point
we
would
like
to
make
is
that
the
statute
that's
alleged
to
be
unconstitutional
in
new
york
as
part
of
the
comprehensive
reorganization
of
our
penal
law
in
new
york
was
repealed
on
july
20,
1965.
that
repealed
to
take
effect
on
september
1,
1967.
that's
the
criminal
anarchy
statute
we
are
talking
about.
so
its
future
chilling
effect
has
stopped
and
ceased
on
september
1,
1967.
it
had
to
be
applied
to
these
defendants
because
the
conduct
we
allege
to
be
criminal
on
their
part
occurred
between
october
1965
and
june
20,
1967,
sometime
before
september
1,
1967.
so
the
future
emanations
so
far
as
potential
offenders
of
this
law
are
concerned,
it
no
longer
exist
and
have
not
existed
and
did
not
exist
at
the
time
the
application
was
made
for
the
federal
court
on
march
12,
1968.
there
had
been
no
more
criminal
anarchy
statute
that's
complained
about
enforced
in
effect
in
new
york.
so
the
potential
harm,
the
chilling
effect
that
might
emanate
from
this
statute
ceased
long
before
in
the
application
was
made
for
federal
relief
in
this
case.
i
should
like
to
point
out
that
apart
from
abstention,
we
have
of
course
2283
and
this
is
the
historic
of
act
1793
that
congress
enacted
as
an
amendment
to
the
fundamental
judiciary
law
of
7089.
and
the
three
words
in
1983
of
title
42
“suit
in
equity”
do
not
really
constitute
and
can
not
arguably
be
made
as
a
question
of
statutory
interpretation
and
exception
to
the
expressly
authorized
by
congress.
that's
what
congress
required
in
1948
when
they
re-codified
2283.
they
want
an
expressly
authorized
exception.
now
i
have
kept
notes
for
many
years
and
what
i
think
or
expressly
authorized
exceptions
to
2283.
this
would
be
the
second
title.
the
first
title
is
the
doctrine
of
abstention.
even
if
you
get
by
abstention,
this
case
unlike
dombrowski
involves
a
pending
proceeding
in
the
state
court
that
was
pending
from
june
20,
1967
until
march
12,
1968.
here
are
the
kinds
of
exceptions
that
i
think
this
court
has
allowed
has
expressly
authorized.
where
you
have
in
the
statute
an
authorization
to
state
any
state
court
proceeding.
you
have
that
in
the
habeas
corpus
act
and
you
have
that
in
the
interpleader
act
of
1926.
it
says
that
the
district
court
congress
says
gives
them
the
power
to
state
any
state
court
proceeding
or
any
federal
court
proceeding,
both
in
the
habeas
corpus
act
and
the
interpleader
act
of
1926.
another
formula
is
a
provision
that
they
can
state
any
court
proceeding
but
without
reference
the
state
court
and
that
appears
in
the
bankruptcy
act
and
the
frazier-lemke
act,
farm-mortgage
act.
thirdly,
--
third
says
that
all
proceedings
shall
cease.
this
appears
in
the
old
shipowners'
liability
act
of
1851.
a
fourth
proceeding
is
that
the
state
court
shall
proceed
no
further
and
that
appears
in
the
federal
removal
statute.
i
would
like
to
add
two
more.
these
four,
i
have
motioned
in
my
brief.
i
would
like
to
add
two
more
that
my
research
has
turned
up
since.
i
have
worked
on
the
brief
and
that
is
the
federal
civil
rights
act
of
1964
has
a
prohibition
with
respect
to
use
of
public
accommodations.
it
has
a
prohibition
to
punish
or
attempt
to
punish
any
person
from
exercising
any
right
or
privilege
secured
by
that
public
accommodation
civil
rights
act
of
1964.
and
it
couples
this
with
authorization
for
injunctive
relief
to
see
that
this
is
carried
out.
now
that
is
what
i
mean
expressly
authorized
by
congress.
that
appears
in
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964,
title
42
of
the
united
states
code,
section
2000
(a)
subdivision
2
(c)
and
(a)
subdivision
3
(a).
and
the
fifth
circuit
in
dilworth
against
riner,
343
f.
2d
226
has
sustained
that
as
an
authorized
exception.
finally,
you
have
an
exception
that's
also,
i
think
ought
to
be
added
and
even
half
dozen.
you
have
an
exception
in
the
right
to
vote
act
when
the
federal
government
moves
into
the
federal
district
court
and
asked
for
an
injunction
against
state
officials
or
state
proceedings
that
interfere
with
a
person's
right
to
vote.
this
comes
from
48
united
states
code
1971
(c).
those
i
think
are
what
we
mean
by
expressly
authorized
exceptions.
now
the
american
law
institute
is
not
congress
but
they
have
been
studying
this
question
of
division
of
jurisdiction
between
state
and
federal
courts.
and
it
has
been
represented
to
this
court
that
they
are
in
favor
of
the
dombrowski
type
of
intervention
at
the
district
court
level.
but
i
find
that
the
american
law
institute
reading
that
draft
on
sections
1371
and
1372
do
not
favor,
do
not
feel
that
dombrowski
authorizes
this
injunctions
and
quite
the
contrary
in
their
have
proposed
section
1371
(c).
they
go
back
to
ashwander
against
the
tva
and
all
of
those
cases
that
support
abstention
of
the
federal
district
court.
finally,
on
this
point
of
the
bar
of
section
2283,
we
might
look
at
what
congress
has
said
in
other
situations
so
far
as
anticipatory
relief
is
concerned
in
the
federal
courts
vis-à-vis
state
court
proceedings.
the
power
of
a
federal
district
court
to
abort,
to
prevent
the
natural
fruition,
the
natural
development
of
a
state
court
proceeding.
one,
we
have
the
removal
statute
and
this
court
has
been
very
strict
on
removal
statute,
most
recent
determination
in
city
of
greenwood
against
peacock.
they
indicate
how
strict
they
are
before
you
can
remove
a
case
that's
already
in
the
federal
court.
that
removal
would
be
under
1443
subdivision
1.
on
the
other
hand,
this
court
has
been
willing
to
allow
removal
where
in
it
is
very
clear
that
the
basis
is
strictly
and
solely
one
of
color,
not
general
civil
rights
but
color
and
this
court
carefully
pointed
that
out
in
rachel
against
georgia
in
volume
384
in
1966.
so
we
do
not
have
the
power
to
abort
any
state
proceedings
from
the
removal
act.
one
of
two
different
remedies
that
this
court
has
in
addition
to
the
injunction
and
declaratory
judgment
asked
here.
next
is
the
question
of
habeas
corpus,
there
is
you
examine
that
very
carefully,
you
would
find
that
habeas
corpus
is
permitted
only
--
the
exhaustion
of
state
remedies
requirement
in
the
statute
which
appears
in
section
2254
of
title
28
appears
only
explicitly
by
the
wording
of
congress
to
apply
to
post-conviction,
post-state
conviction
for
a
remedy.
but
this
court
many
years
ago
in
ex
parte
royal
in
1886
extended
it
to
pre-conviction
and
this
court
has
never
interfered
with
that
interpretation
on
the
restriction
of
federal
habeas
corpus
to
get
relief
for
defendant
in
the
toils
of
the
state
criminal
process.
finally,
this
court
itself
is
a
constitutional
tribunal
but
its
jurisdiction
over
appellate
matters
is
fixed
by
congress
under
article
3
of
the
constitution.
and
if
you
examine
the
requirements
in
this
court
in
order
to
review
state
determinations,
one
thing
above
everything
else
stands
up
and
that
is
that
the
state
court,
the
state
judgment
must
be
a
final
judgment.
this
court
has
used
this
terms.
the
statute
provides
that
in
section
1257.
it
must
be
the
final
word
of
a
final
court.
otherwise,
this
court
has
no
power
to
interfere
with
anything
a
state
tribunal
does
below.
and
this
is
a
constitutional
tribunal,
the
federal
district
courts
are
creatures
of
congress
that
congress
tomorrow
could
abolish
the
federal
district
courts
without
any
need
of
constitutional
amendment.
under
those
circumstances,
i
would
suggest
that
this
court
called
upon
as
they
are
to
make
an
exception
for
section
2283
in
the
light
of
the
existence
of
all
our
federal
statute
and
also
and
especially
because
of
the
delay
that
will
attend
state
criminal
proceedings
as
is
evidence
by
this
case,
979
days
till
today
this
case
has
been
in
the
federal
court.
thank
you.
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
indictment
is
aimed
not
at
the
discussion
or
dissemination
of
ideas
on
anarchy,
communism
or
what
have
you.
but
on
the
accumulation
of
an
arsenal
of
weapons
and
ammunition
and
gasoline
and
black
powder
to
overthrow
or
paralyze,
overthrow
for
a
week,
a
month
however
so
long
local
government
installations.
what
is
the
evidence
in
this
case
on
this
unusual
review
in
the
high
court?
the
evidence,
the
real
evidence
in
this
case
consists
of
6,524
rounds
of
ammunition,
plus
32
boxes
of
ammunition,
plus
six
cans
of
ammunition,
enough
ammunition
with
a
good
marksman
to
kill
9,000
people.
this
ammunition
was
seized
pursuant
to
an
arrest
warrant
plus
a
search
warrant
after
the
indictment
of
the
appellants
in
this
case.
in
addition,
we
have
43
guns
similarly
seized
pursuant
to
an
arrest
warrant
after
the
indictment
of
these
appellants,
plus
a
search
warrant
particularly
describing
what
was
to
be
seized.
these
weapons
--
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
this
is
part
--
--
action
for
an
injunction
and
a
declaratory
judgment
in
the
federal
court?
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
this
evidence
had
been
seized
already.
we've
had
--
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
we
can't
--
we
have
--
it's
in
the
grand
jury
minutes
from
page
1
to
45,
and
if
your
honor
wishes,
i'll
hand
them
up
for
the
consideration
of
this
court
alone.
i'm
not
permitted
to
publish
them
in
the
record
and
give
opposing
counsel
grand
jury
minutes.
it's
customary
in
our
high
court
of
our
state
to
hand
up
grand
jury
minutes
to
the
high
court
alone
and
let
them
consider
whether
or
not
there
was
sufficient
evidence
or
for
a
grand
jury
to
hold
someone
in
contempt
without
giving
the
other
side
the
entire
investigation.
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
well,
it
might
--
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
except
that
your
honor,
the
indictment
talks
in
the
first
four
counts
about
and
19
overt
acts
specified
in
count
five
about
discussions.
and
i
thought
it
might
be
material
resolving
a
question
of
what
constitutes
free
speech
to
have
some
inklings
about
the
nature
of
this
discussion.
and
for
that
reason,
i
still
offer
if
the
court
wants
to
peruse
them
whatever
value
they
may
have,
the
grand
jury
minutes
consisting
of
page
1
to
151
given
on
--
testimony
given
on
june
20,
1967
and
on
june
--
on
january
15,
1968
for
the
superseding
indictment
relating
to
these
weapons
in
describing
them
by
serial
number
and
color
and
so
forth,
pages
1
to
145.
i
happen
to
have
with
me
a
certified
copy.
if
the
court
would
--
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
your
honor,
i
happen
to
be
the
draftsman
of
those
10
consecutive
sections
of
the
penal
law
which
were
revised
in
1963
and
were
continued
without
any
change
when
the
entire
penal
law
was
revised
in
1965
to
take
effect
september
1,
1967.
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
yes,
they
were
indicted
under
--
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
yes,
your
honor.
now,
this
is
something
that
neither
counsel
appears
to
understand
because
they
have
not
read
the
weapons
law.
section
1897
is
the
heart
of
the
weapons
law.
it's
been
continued
in
the
new
penal
law.
this
law,
a
derivation
of
the
old
sullivan
law
makes
it
criminal
without
proof
of
anything
more
if
you
possess
a
handgun,
that's
a
gun,
a
pistol,
a
revolver,
an
automatic,
four
counts
in
the
indictment
deal
with
handguns.
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
no.
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
no,
she
is
not.
it
is
not
true,
your
honor.
the
other
remaining
37
counts
of
the
41
that
deal
with
weapons,
deal
with
shoulder
guns,
rifles,
shotguns,
and
carbines.
now,
it
is
not
criminal
in
new
york
to
possess
one
of
these
guns
unless
you
can
prove
intent
to
use
the
same
unlawfully
against
others.
obviously,
there
are
many
hunters
and
other
people
that
want
rifles.
the
usual
criminal
prosecution
for
possession
of
a
rifle
or
a
shotgun
or
a
carbine,
the
intent
is
to
rob
somebody,
to
assault
him
or
possibly
to
rape
some
woman.
in
this
case,
there
is
no
such
intent.
the
intent
is
merely
to
overthrow
the
local
(inaudible)
--
the
local
government.
now,
the
way
this
prosecution
came
about
because
of
the
statements
made
by
counsel
might
be
of
interest
of
this
court.
a
large
investment
in
time
and
money,
and
not
simply
sitting
under
a
shady
tree
rubbing
red
pepper
into
the
eyes
of
someone
else
was
expended
by
the
police.
several
undercover
detectives
were
assigned
over
a
period
of
almost
two
years
and
they
joined
and
infiltrate
this
organization.
one
of
them
got
into
the
higher
councils
of
the
organization,
became
a
vice-president
of
it
was
in
on
all
of
the
discussion.
this
man
by
the
way
showed
remarkable
courage
because
in
november
of
1966,
it
was
stated
to
him
by
the
leader
of
the
organization
that
they
knew
someone
of
their
members
was
an
agent,
an
enemy
agent
or
law
enforcement
agent.
in
any
event
from
what
the
police
told
the
district
attorney,
this
infiltration
started
in
october
1965.
in
april
of
1967,
the
police
first
came
to
the
district
attorney.
and
this
is
what
they
told
us,
they
told
us
about
these
discussions.
they
told
us
what
these
discussions
concern;
how
to
make
a
bomb,
whether
you
use
a
wine
bottle
with
thin
glass
containing
gasoline,
or
a
soft
drink
bottle
with
thicker
glass.
when
you
use
one,
when
you
use
the
other,
how
you
make
it.
the
problem
of
the
fuse
which
is
difficult
to
get,
how
can
you
hand
make
a
fuse?
one
fuse
is
a
pack
of
cigarettes;
pardon
me,
based
lighted
cigarette
on
a
pack
of
matches
on
top
of
the
molotov
cocktail,
the
gasoline.
another
one
is
to
get
a
rubber
tube,
fill
it
with
black
powder
and
insert
one
end
into
the
molotov
cocktail
and
light
the
other.
still
another
one,
when
you
pour
gasoline
into
the
streets
and
you
don't
want
to
burn
yourself,
use
a
flare
gun
not
a
match
because
you
would
go
up
to
the
flames.
how
do
you
--
how
do
you
manufacture
a
bazooka,
which

well,
you
use

of
how
you
can

both.
how
you
use

how
you

to

mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
on
june
20,
1967,
the
original
indictment
was
returned.
after
one
day
of
testimony
before
the
grand
jury
by
these
undercover
police
agents,
the
warrants
for
the
arrest
of
these
appellants,
particularly
the
same
day.
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
that
is
correct.
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
that
is
correct.
i
wanted
merely
to
go
to
the
--
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
your
honor,
it's
because
of
so
many
motions
that
have
been
made
in
this
case.
never
before
in
the
70-year
history
of
our
county,
which
is
the
fifth
largest
in
the
united
states
have
so
many
motions
been
made
in
the
single
case.
we
have
weighed
the
papers
on
a
scale.
they've
weighed
20
pounds
all
total.
everybody
made
a
motion
and
joined
in
someone
else's
motion.
and
we
did
however,
based
on
the
testimony
given
pages
1
to
151
these
grand
jury
minutes
which
the
court
may
or
may
not
accept
if
it
wishes.
we
returned
another
indictment,
conspiracy
to
murder
two
civil
rights
leaders
whitney
young
and
roy
wilkins.
we
tried
that
indictment
and
convicted
before
a
jury
two
of
the
appellants
here,
harris
and
ferguson.
and
that
conviction
is
pending
on
appeal.
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
since
march
12,
1968,
when
application
was
first
made
by
the
appellants
to
get
a
three-judge
panel.
and
the
decision
of
the
three-judge
panel
came
down
in
june
of
1968,
and
then
application
is
made
for
this
court's
review.
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
the
delay
from
june
20,
1967
to
march
12,
1968
has
no
connection
with
the
federal
court.
from
march
12,
1968
until
today
march
--
april
1,
1969
is
purely
federal
delay.
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
no,
the
district
attorney
--
one
of
the
assistant
district
attorneys
agreed
that
they
await
the
outcome
of
proceedings.
and
if
this
court
did
not
note
probable
jurisdiction
it
would've
gone
to
trial
the
next
day
in
the
state
court.
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
no,
no
your
honor.
now,
i'd
like
to
say
briefly
that
that's
what's
involved
in
this
case.
it's
not
advocacy
of
ideas
or
opinions.
it's
advocacy
of
minute
detailed
action.
i
want
to
add
one
or
two
more
types
of
actions
here
besides
the
assassination.
there
are
other
personal
types
of
instruction
that
i
have
never
seen
in
any
curriculum
in
my
life.
i
have
never
known
there
was
a
cause
in
mayhem
for
example.
how
you
use
the
blunt
end
of
a
hatchet
against
a
policeman
and
disable
him
by
hitting
him
on
the
base
of
the
spine.
i
never
heard
of
aikido,
a
japanese
combination
of
karate
and
judo,
which
operates
on
the
principle
of
hitting
you
at
a
joint
so
as
to
break
the
distal
ends
of
the
bone.
this
is
some
of
the
instruction
that
went
on
during
this
two-year
period
that
these
people
were
being
observed.
then,
interestingly
enough
and
this
is
finally
what
caused
the
grand
jury
to
act
in
queens
district
attorney
to
submit
it.
they
had
a
test
run
on
june
16,
this
indictment,
this
matter
was
presented
to
the
grand
jury
on
june
20.
a
test
run
involving
two
of
these
appellants
when
they
went
out
in
a
car
and
tried
out
these
tactics,
firing
shots
at
stall
windows
in
south
shoemaker
in
queens.
now,
under
these
circumstances,
we
thought
it
best
after
plans
had
been
formulated,
a
timetable
made
as
these
minutes
will
disclose
to
the
court,
weapons
had
been
accumulated
and
distributed
and
they
were
ready
to
go
that
now
if
the
heart
and
catastrophe
was
to
be
prevented,
action
had
to
be
taken.
now,
i
wanted
briefly
make
the
point
that
under
subdivision
9
of
section
1897,
you
must
prove
intent
if
it's
a
shoulder
gun.
and
the
intent
that
the
district
attorney
intends
to
urge
in
this
case
is
the
intent
to
overthrow
local
government.
not
to
rob
anybody,
not
to
assault
any
passersby,
not
to
you
do
what
999
out
of
a
thousand
rifled
cases
that
we
prosecute
involved,
but
the
rather
unusual
intent,
this
magnificent
protest
gesture
of
overthrowing
the
local
establishment.
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
no,
it
merely
says
anyone
who
possesses
a
dangerous
weapon,
and
weapon
is
defined
as
rifle
and
shotgun.
firearm
is
different,
that's
a
handgun.
anyone
who
possesses
a
rifle
or
shotgun
in
effect
with
the
intent
to
use
the
same
unlawfully
against
another
is
guilty
of
misdemeanor.
now,
we
could
not
--
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
we
maintain
it
is,
yes.
we
maintain
it
is.
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
no,
not
in
that
language,
your
honor.
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
it
says
merely
with
intent
to
use
the
same
unlawfully.
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
unlawfully.
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
the
law
that
we
--
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
section
1897
subdivision
9
of
the
former
penal
law.
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
it
says
anyone
who
has
in
his
possession
a
dangerous
weapon
with
intent
to
use
the
same
unlawfully
against
another.
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
yes.
in
a
criminal
anarchy
statutes
of
the
former
penal
law
section
116.
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
it
says
that
a
person
who
advocates
the
overthrow
of
government
by
force
or
violence
or
unlawful
means
is
guilty
of
criminal
anarchy.
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
that's
right.
and
that
is
where
the
unlawful
intent
of
a
possession
of
these
weapons
would
come
in
37
of
the
41
counts
that
deal
with
weapons
in
this
indictment.
now
with
respect
to
--
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
i
don't
know
because
in
this
test
run
that
i've
made
reference
to
judge
marshall,
they
didn't
shoot
--
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
if
we
could
prove
whom
they
wanted
to
harm,
not
people
generally.
but
if
i
could
prove
that
he
was
going
to
shoot
his
brother-in-law
or
that
he
intended
to
take
two
druggists
in
the
corner
then,
yes.
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
yes,
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
yes.
well,
your
honor,
the
intention
of
the
draftsman
of
the
weapons
statute
in
1963
--
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
i
was
only
the
draftsman,
a
committee
of
draftsmen.
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
yes,
because
we
thought
that
--
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
not
particularly
the
criminal
--
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
--
syndicalism
statute
your
honor,
but
any
thing
defined
in
the
penal
law
is
unlawful
was
what
was
meant
by
the
word
unlawful
in
subdivision
9
of
former
1897
of
the
penal
law.
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
and
that
included
criminal
anarchy.
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
oh
no!
no
your
honor,
no.
it
was
just
one
of
the
provisions
of
the
former
penal
law
that
were
included
when
these
weapon
statute
were
redrafted
in
1963.
that
was
in
--
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
yes,
your
honor,
in
37
counts
not
four
of
the
other
weapons
counts,
37,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
my
name
is
ludwig,
i'm
the
chief
assistant
district
attorney
of
queens.
this
is
the
second
time
this
case
is
being
argued.
the
first
time
on
april
1st,
you
mr.
chief
justice
and
justice
douglas
weren't
on
the
bench.
i
just
like
to
say
at
the
outset
that
the
question
of
publicity
in
this
case
was
brought
to
the
attention
of
one
of
our
best
supreme
court
justices,
justice
shapiro
in
queens
and
he
in
an
exhaustive
opinion
which
is
appended
to
my
brief
went
into
all
facets
of
the
question
and
his
conclusion
was
that
by
no
stretch
of
the
imagination
could
the
district
attorney
in
this
case
be
accused
of
issuing
any
inaccurate,
unfair
prejudicial
statements
regarding
this
matter
and
that
any
statement
the
district
attorney
ever
made
or
i
ever
made
in
connection
with
this
case
was
proper,
justified
and
something
the
public
had
right
to
know.
many
of
the
quotations
that
were
read
by
mrs.
piel
are
not
quotations
of
the
district
attorney
but
of
some
newspaper
reporter
writing
the
story
without
quotations
marks
and
i
think
in
all
candor
this
court
ought
to
know
that.
now,
the
defendant
in
this
case
is
the
district
attorney
of
queens,
actually
the
defendant
should
be
a
grand
jury
of
22
people
in
queens
who
saw
fit
to
accuse
these
defendants.
the
district
attorney
did
not
accuse
them.
they
were
accused
by
the
grand
jury.
the
district
attorney
knew
nothing
of
this
investigation
while
it
was
going
on
for
a
year
and
a
half
or
two
years
until
approximately
a
month
before
the
matter
was
produ
--
presented
to
the
grand
jury.
the
evidence
in
this
case
was
obtained
by
a
--
an
undercover
police
office
who
had
infiltrated
this
group,
became
a
part
of
it,
in
fact
was
a
vice
president
of
it
and
who
gained
enough
information
about
what
was
happening
to
enable
--
to
present
this
case
to
the
grand
jury.
now,
this
indictment
is
a
--
one
that
involves
15
defendants,
11
of
them
are
appellants
in
this
case.
the
other
four
did
not
appeal.
the
indictment
contains
48
counts
and
deals
with
five
crimes.
it's
a
superseding
inictment.
the
first
indictment
was
found
on
june
20th,
1967,
the
case
was
presented
on
june
20th,
the
foreman
handed
up
the
indictment
that
night.
it
was
a
one
day
presentation
in
great
confidence
and
secrecy
before
the
grand
jury.
the
foreman
handed
it
up
on
june
20th
in
--
and
the
defendants
were
arrested
pursuant
to
arrest
warrants
and
these
weapons
and
arms
and
arsenal
were
seized
pursuant
to
search
warrants
signed
by
a
supreme
court
justice
particularly
describing
what
was
to
be
seized
the
following
morning,
june
21st.
now,
two
indictments
were
handed
up
by
this
grand
jury
as
a
result
of
the
testimony
and
their
testimony
consists
of
a
151
pages
and
i
offered
it
to
the
court
on
two
occasions,
the
first
time
i
argued
here
a
year
ago
and
no
action
was
taken.
these
minutes
of
the
grand
jury
unlike
harris
against
younger,
the
california
and
it
cannot
be
printed
in
records
and
are
not
printed
customarily
in
our
state
appellate
courts,
the
judges
asked
the
district
attorney
to
hand
up
a
copy
of
the
minutes
because
we
have
a
very
strict
rule
on
indictments
on
the
state
court.
the
rule
is
that
there
must
be
proof
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt
in
the
grand
jury
minutes
that
the
defendants
are
guilty
if
unexplained.
other
than
the
federal
courts
and
elsewhere
you
don't
need
that
quantum
of
proof
and
we
also
have
another
--
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
that
is
true
sir.
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
unexplained
and
further
than
that
in
people
against
jackson
and
people
against
pittsburgh,
our
state
court
of
appeals
has
imposed
another
rule
on
us
that
if
you
have
the
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
at
the
time
of
trial
but
you
didn't
have
it
at
the
time
of
the
accusation
before
the
grand
jury
then
that's
sufficient
to
justify
reversal
as
a
matter
of
law,
pittsburg
and
jackson.
so
--
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
yes.
so,
that
is
why
--
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
many
of
our
--
many
motions
are
made
attacking
our
indictments
on
the
insufficiency
of
the
evidence
before
the
grand
jury
and
i
regret
to
report
that
they
are
dismissed
because
the
judge
reads
the
minutes
and
says,
“i
don't
think
you've
made
a
case
up.”
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
none
on
the
felony
level.
the
state
--
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
--
constitution
requires
for
a
felony
indictment
by
a
grand
jury
can
even
be
waived
by
a
defendant.
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
non-waivable
by
a
defendant.
got
to
be
accused
by
a
cross
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
yes.
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
no,
by
decision
--
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
--
of
the
state
court
of
appeals
interpreting
the
constitution
of
the
state
that
requires
indictment
by
the
grand
jury
and
also
a
provision
of
the
code
of
criminal
procedure
of
the
state
of
new
york
that
requires
sufficient
proof
to
convict
at
trial
if
unexplained.
that's
the
words
of
the
statute.
now,
i
would
like
to
go
into
these
minutes
are
here
if
the
court
will
accept
them,
i'll
hand
them
to
the
marshall.
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
yes.
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
yes,
your
honor,
otherwise
it
will
be
reversed.
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
that's
the
highest
court
of
the
state
in
two
cases,
people
against
jackson
and
people
against
pittsburg.
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
it
does
not,
your
honor.
it
merely
is
done
by
the
legislature
of
new
york
in
the
current
code
of
criminal
procedure.
but
it
has
been
there
for
many
years.
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
now,
in
this
indictment,
we
have
a
--
we
could've
had
a
131
indictments
here
if
we
were
proceeding
strictly
according
to
the
common
law
which
required
a
single
crime
and
a
single
defendant
for
each
indictment.
but
again,
our
code
of
criminal
procedure
and
those
sections
are
set
forth
at
page
8
and
9
of
my
brief
on
re-argument
and
also
the
original
briefs,
allows
us
to
combine
defendants
and
charges
in
one
indictment
provided
we
separately
number
each
crime
in
account.
and
that
provision
appears
in
section
279
of
the
code
of
criminal
procedure
and
the
reason
i
make
mention
of
it
is
this
at
this
stage,
because
we
have
combined
here,
in
one
indictment,
the
indictment
now
before
the
court,
15
defendants
and
48
counts.
we
could've
had
111
different
indictments
and
then
moved
to
consolidate
them
on
the
grounds
that
would
come
in
issues.
the
test
for
putting
these
counts
in
one
indictment
is
there
are
four
different
circumstances
in
279.
the
one
of
the
four
that
we
selected
is
where
the
crimes
charged
are
connected
together
and
are
part
of
a
common
scheme
or
plan.
now,
by
a
motion
before
the
appellate
court,
you
can
sever
this
indictment.
but
before
the
trial
court,
these
indictments
could
be
severed.
now,
these
things
then
are
by
law,
by
the
lore
of
pleading
in
criminal
matters
of
our
state
interrelated
charges.
i
want
to
also
say
that
in
these
48
counts,
the
first
four
of
them
deal
with
criminal
anarchy
and
charged
all
the
defendants
with
the
commission
of
that
crime.
but
the
first
three
deals
with
criminal
anarchy
and
the
fourth
is
conspiracy
to
commit
criminal
action.
now,
the
others
--
the
other
counts
in
the
indictment
have
nothing
to
do
with
criminal
anarchy
but
are
there
because
they're
interrelated
with
the
ultimate
purpose
of
this
indictment.
count
five
is
a
conspiracy
to
commit
arson
in
the
third
degree.
it
does
not
--
that
count
is
not
charged
against
everybody.
many
of
the
defendants
are
not
charged
with
that
missed
case.
count
six
permitting
--
the
count
seven
dealing
with
--
countsix
and
seven
deal
with
permitting
premises,
misdemeanor,
permitting
premises
to
be
used
for
anarchy.
the
remaining
counts,
41
and
all
deal
with
weapons.
now,
this
may
be
a
little
but
abstruse
but
it's
important
to
make
this
one
point
that
four
of
these
41
counts
that
deal
with
weapons,
deal
with
handguns
and
thirty
seven
deal
with
shoulder
guns.
under
the
weapons
law
of
new
york
which
i
told
this
court,
i
am
the
author
of
--
last
time,
mere
possession
of
a
hand
gun
in
four
of
these
41
counts
is
all
the
prosecution
has
to
establish
to
convict
of
a
crime
but
for
shoulder
guns,
rifles,
shotguns,
carbines,
you
need
proof
of
intent
to
use
unlawfully
against
another.
and
there's
a
good
reason
for
that.
a
lot
of
people
have
rifles
to
hunt
animals,
but
pistols
and
revolvers
and
automatic
weapons
normally
are
used
only
to
hunt
other
human
beings.
the
only
proof
of
intent
to
use
unlawfully
against
another
we
have
for
this
indictment
and
the
only
evidence
that
was
before
the
grand
jury
at
the
time
the
case
was
presented
was
the
intent
to
paralyze
and
overthrow
local
government.
consequently,
when
counsel
says
that
you
can
--
you
can't
when
irreparable
injury
is
done,
grave
and
immediate
because
of
the
possibility
of
concurrent
sentences
in
this
case.
that
is
not
so
and
i
will
demonstrate
why
its
not
because
there
are
first
of
all
four
defendants
in
this
case
who
are
not
charged
with
possession
of
weapon,
i
amend
that
there
were
five
who
are
not
charged
with
possession
of
weapons,
harriet
knoll,
raymond
smith,
fernandez,
ms.
west,
and
stan
--
max
stanford.
those
five
are
not
charged
with
any
possession
of
weapons
in
this
indictment,
it
isn't
because
they
didn't
posses
weapons
but
because
when
these
search
warrants
were
executed,
they
were
not
found
in
possession
of
the
weapons.
therefore,
these
five
people,
of
these
five
people
three
of
them
are
charged
with
no
anarchy
crimes
at
all.
so
in
these
five
cases
that
are
charged,
pardon
me,
with
no
non-anarchy
crimes.
so
in
these
--
three
of
these
five
cases,
we
have
persons
who
could
be
convicted
only
of
anarchy
connected
crimes
and
not
of
any
correlative
crimes
and
the
doctrine
of
concurrent
sentences
would
not
apply.
i
--
if
i
am
not
mistaken,
if
i
--
as
i
read
benton
against
maryland,
this
court
last
term
abandoned
the
concurrent
sentence
doctrine
anyway
so
that
the
reason
for
this
position
of
epton
no
longer
holds.
but
many
can
--
in
any
case
we
have
three
persons
that
could
be
convicted
solely
of
this
anarchy
connected
crimes
under
this
indictment
and
would
have
full
opportunity
to
bring
the
question
of
the
validity
of
the
new
york
statute
before
this
court.
by
the
way
the
new
york
statute
that
we're
talking
about
has
then
repealed
by
section
--
by
action
of
the
legislature
on
july
20th,
1965,
that's
five
years,
almost
five
years
ago.
the
repeal
was
to
take
effect
on
september
1st,
1967.
this
was
in
connection
with
an
entire
revision
of
the
new
york
penal
law.
now,
and
a
new
anarchy
section
was
substituted
on
july
20th,
1965.
now,
so
far
as
this
indictment
is
concerned,
it
was
handed
down
we
say
originally
in
--
on
june
20th,
1967.
the
court
of
appeals
--
the
epton
case
began
in
july
of
1964.
epton
was
tried
in
june
of
1965
and
convicted.
the
--
he
didn't
get
through
with
the
first
intermediate
appellate
court
until
december
of
1966.
and
the
highest
court
of
the
state
came
down
with
their
decision
in
epton
on
may
16th,
1967,
one
month
and
four
days
before
the
grand
jury
indicted
the
persons
in
this
case.
now,
it
is
true
that
some
of
the
acts
for
which
these
people
are
accused
took
place
prior
to
the
announcement
of
the
decision
in
epton.
but
there
is
one
other
unusual
feature
of
our
weapons
law
in
new
york
and
that
is
the
amnesty
features.
and
under
the
amnesty
feature,
any
person
at
that
time
if
they
had
read
epton,
when
it
come
down
on
may
16th
and
were
following
the
law
as
closely
as
counsel
seems
to
suppose
they
would
come
into
a
police
station
during
the
month
of
june,
today
they
can
come
in
during
any
month
and
hand
over
these
guns
with
amnesty
and
immunity
given
by
the
legislature.
that
is
section
1900,
subdivision
(a)
(1)
of
the
former
new
york
penal
law
enforced
in
effect
at
the
time
this
indictment
came
down.
this
is
a
defense
of
recantation
and
amnesty
given
by
new
york.
so
if
these
people
were
being
guided
by
what
the
highest
court
of
this
--
of
the
state
said
on
may
16th,
they
could
have
recant
it,
turned
in
thereof
with
impunity.
and
believe
me
there
would
be
no
indictment
in
this
case
if
all
we
had
is
what
appears
in
the
appendix
in
harris
against
younger
namely
statements
or
pamphlets
or
speeches
or
abstract
advocacy
of
the
doctrine
of
anarchy.
what
we're
concerned
with
was
in
this
case,
the
amassing
of
an
arsenal
for
the
purpose
of
paralyzing
and
overthrowing
government.
now,
this
court
in
its
most
recent
pronouncement
on
the
question
of
free
speech,
brandenburg
at
the
last
term
on
june
9th
say
that
you
may
punish
a
person
for
advocacy,
for
words
provided
it's
accompanied
by
inciting
and
producing
lawless
action
and
there
is
probable
cause
that
that
lawless
action
would
occur.
now,
the
minutes
of
the
grand
jury
which
are
here
before
this
court
show
that
they
assembled
9000
rounds
of
ammunition.
they
assembled
cans
of
gasoline,
cans
of
oil,
intending
to
burn
the
subways,
the
power
plant,
the
lumber
yards,
the
tire
factories,
public
communications
facilities
in
queens
county
and
they
had
a
detailed
blue
print
and
a
timetable
for
the
execution
of
this
plan.
the
speech
involved
in
this
case,
the
advocacy
only
the
--
is
the
mortise
and
tenon,
the
cement,
the
binding
quality
to
put
these
acts
for
overthrow
together.
as
a
matter
of
fact
on
16th,
there
was
a
dry
run
in
which
these
weapons
were
used
against
some
stores
in
the
jamaica
section
of
queens,
the
testimony
before
the
grand
jury
so
revealed.
and
it's
set
forth
in
my
brief.
bazookas
--
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
we
did
not
yet
bring
them
to
trial
out
of
deference
to
this
court,
your
honor.
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
we
wanted
to
give
this
tribunal
a
chance
also
for
the
trial
--
for
the
guidance
of
the
trial
judge.
may
i
say
this,
--
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
no
stay
has
ever
been
issued
for
--
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
--
but
it
was
agreed
that
if
there
is
a
question,
let
the
federal
tribunals
dispose
of
it.
we
have
in
a
second
indictment
convicted
two
of
these
appellants
in
this
case,
ferguson
and
harris.
they
were
convicted
of
conspiring
to
murder
whitney
young
and
roy
wilkins.
they
had
other
people
on
the
list
as
well
but
they
were
the
first
two.
they
had
a
trial
before
a
jury.
the
intermediate
appellate
court,
five
judges
found
unanimously
that
there
was
sufficient
evidence
to
convict
but
three
judge
--
two
judges
dissented
of
the
five
on
the
grounds
that
because
senator
robert
kennedy
whose
name
was
also
on
the
list
to
be
killed
was
mentioned
at
a
time
when
he
was
lying
between
life
and
death
that
a
new
trial
should
be
granted
or
the
judge
should've
granted
a
continuance.
the
highest
court
of
our
state,
seven
judges
found
identically,
unanimously
that
there
was
sufficient
evidence
to
convict
them
of
conspiracy
to
commit
murder
in
the
first
degree
and
--
but
they
also
agreed,
three
of
them
agreed
that
maybe
the
trial
judge
should've
granted
a
continuance
of
that
--
on
the
count
of
the
circumstance
of
the
assassination
of
president
kennedy.
i'd
like
to
say
this
in
connection
with
the
question
of
the
section
2291
--
the
2283.
for
177
years,
we've
had
that
statute
on
the
books.
march
2nd,
1793
and
never
once
has
this
court
in
anyway
said
that
a
lower
court,
that's
a
creature
of
congress,
must
not
observe
that
statute.
for
99
years
since
1781,
we
had
the
provisions
of
section
1983,
the
so-called
civil
rights
act
which
gives
a
person
a
cause
of
action,
an
action
at
law,
a
suit
and
equity
or
other
problem,
means
of
redress
if
any
rights,
privileges
or
immunities
guaranteed
to
him
by
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
are
taken
away
from
him
under
color
of
state
law,
never
in
99
years
has
this
court
ever
held
that
that
constitutes
the
word,
the
three
words
suit
in
equity
constitutes
and
exception
to
1983.
now,
recently
this
court
has
taken
up
this
question,
they
took
it
up
in
dombrowski
against
pfister
ad
very
carefully
justice
brennan
in
writing
that
opinion
observe
the
restrictions
of
the
act
of
1793.
and
justice
harlan
in
his
first
footnote
in
his
dissenting
opinion
also
called
the
attention
of
the
court
that
if
there
had
been
an
action
pending
at
the
time
of
application
to
the
federal
court
then
of
course
this
court
could
not
reverse
any
--
could
not
just
authorize
intervention
below.
again
it
came
up
in
several
other
cases,
cameron
against
johnson
is
a
good
illustration
from
mississippi,
came
up
from
mississippi
and
were
sent
back
by
this
court
to
the
district
court
in
the
southern
district
of
mississippi
to
have
them
determine
whether
2283
was
a
bar
and
the
district
court
of
mississippi,
three-judge
district
court
came
back
and
said
yes,
we
think
the
suit
is
barred
by
2283
and
this
court
affirmed.
but
there
was
a
footnote
by
justice
douglas
where
he
said,
“well,
we
don't
have
to
decide
the
question
of
2283.”
but
still
this
court
did
affirm
the
determination
of
the
district
court
of
mississippi.
again
in
brooks
against
briley
from
tennessee,
same
thing,
district
court
there,
three-judge
district
court
said,
“you
can't
get
by
here
with
2283.”
can't
get
by
--
“no,
can
you
get
by
on
the
companion
declaratory
judgment.”
a
case
came
up
to
the
supreme
court
affirmed.
this
are
all
very
recent
cases
all
involving
1983
as
an
exception
to
2283.
again
in
zwickler
against
boll
coming
from
wisconsin,
same
result,
this
court's
affirming,
the
district
court's
denying.
so
the
most
recent
authority
in
this
court
is
that
2283
is
hurdle.
now
you
have
two
hurdles
to
surmount
before
we
can
get
to
the
question
of
free
speech.
you
have
two
hurdles
to
surmount.
one,
you
got
to
get
by
this
historic
barrier
of
congress
since
1793,
you've
got
to
surmount
that
hurdle
before
you
can
go
anywhere
else.
the
26
words
that
were
put
in
amending
the
parent
statute,
the
judiciary
act
of
1789,
26
words
have
to
be
observed.
now,
this
court
has
repeatedly
said
in
1941,
they
said
in
the
natuzzi
case,
we
must
be
scrupulous,
must
be
scrupulous
about
the
bound
--
the
meets
and
bounds
that
congress
sets
for
courts
of
their
own
creation,
must
be
scrupulous.
then
in
1948,
when
congress
codified
three
exceptions,
in
1951,
this
court
revisited
once
again
the
statute
of
1793
and
at
that
time
they
said,
you
got
to
go
by
those
three
exceptions
of
congress
and
you
can't
go
any
further.
now,
there's
another
consideration
involved
here,
it
interrupted
and
stayed
in
the
federal
prosecution.
and
that
is
that
this
tribunal
which
is
a
constitutional
tribunal,
is
not
a
circuit
court
or
a
(audio
static)
constitution
yet
congress
in
fixing
which
they
have
the
power
to
do
in
article
3,
section
2,
the
appellate
jurisdiction
of
this
court
carefully
requires
that
there'd
be
a
final
judgment
of
a
state
tribunal
and
a
decision
by
the
highest
court
in
which
a
decision
can
be
had
before
state
action
may
be
reviewed
by
this,
a
constitutional
tribunal.
how
can
we
then
say
that
this
court
is
going
by
statutory
interpretation,
this
isn't
a
constitutional
question,
if
to
lower
federal
courts,
a
power
it
does
not
even
arrogate
to
its
self?
why
congress
has
the
power
unless
this
court
wants
to
overrule
ex
parte
mccarthy.
congress
has
the
power
to
take
this
case
right
away
from
this
court
now
by
taking
away
appellate
jurisdiction
over
any
questions,
let's
say
of
denial
of
injunctions
by
three-judge
courts
below.
unless
we
overrule
ex
parte
mccarthy
which
involves
free
speech,
which
involve
free
speech
that
would
be
the
result.
now,
i
believe
as
far
as
speech
is
concerned
--
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
to
take
away
jurisdiction
from
this
court,
your
honor?
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
it
would
be
a
--
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
it
would
be
--
i
don't
advocate
it
by
any
means,
i'm
not
advocating
that
the
appellate
jurisdiction
of
this
constitutional
court
ever
be
tampered
with
congress
but
i
see
--
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
--
this
court
has
sustained
in
the
past.
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
yes.
well,
i'd
say
that
this
suit
in
equity
in
1983
is
just
those
words,
there
were
three
phrases,
action
at
lawsuit
and
equity
or
rather
a
proper
proceeding
for
redress.
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
yes,
but
the
cases
which
this
court
says
are
exceptions
where
the
federal
court
can
enjoin
are
there
are
a
quite
a
number.
in
1851,
a
ship
owner
who
deposits
a
money
equal
to
the
debt
can
relieve
a
lien
against
this
ship.
in
1875,
a
bankruptcy
exception
was
allowed
namely
that
all
proceedings
in
state
as
well
as
federal
courts
will
be
stayed.
several
other
exceptions
have
been
allowed
by
congress
to
the
state.
they
allow
it
in
connection
with
the
frazier-lemke
farm
mortgage
act
during
the
depression
in
1930's.
the
state
collection
proceeding.
they
have
allowed
it
in
the
famous
habeas
of
our
immemorial
habeas
corpus
act,
federal
habeas
corpus
act,
they
can
stop
all
proceedings
in
a
state
court.
they
allow
it
and
the
interpleader
act.
but
in
all
of
these
cases
as
this
court
said
in
amalgamated
clothing
workers
against
richman
in
1951
after
the
amendment,
in
all
of
these
cases,
the
language
that
congress
used
is
pretty
explicit.
it
doesn't
have
to
refer
to
1983
by
number.
but
it
has
to
be
pretty
explicit
and
stay
--
say
that
proceedings
may
be
stayed
either
in
a
state
court
or
in
any
court
or
it
may
say
that
all
proceedings
shall
cease
wherever
they
are.
they
use
a
collocation
of
words
quite
different
than
merely
a
suit
in
equity.
now
a
suit
in
equity
can
be
brought
for
a
lot
of
things
as
your
honors
well
knows,
a
bill
quia
timet,
an
action
for
recession
of
a
contract,
a
lot
of
suits
in
equity
can
be
brought
without
resorting
to
a
stay
or
an
injunction.
injunction
isn't
the
only
type
of
equitable
remedy.
second,
a
suit
in
equity
can
be
brought
in
a
state
court
and
the
state
court
could
grant
a
stay
without
running
into
the
federal
court.
and
third
and
this
is
important,
the
suit
in
equity
can
be
brought
even
to
stay,
a
threatened
procedure
proceeding
in
the
state
court.
and
in
that
respect,
our
case,
this
is
the
most
restrictive
interpretation,
the
most
limiting
interpretation
on
19
--
on
2283,
ex
parte
young
of
course
tells
us
that
the
--
the
memorial
--
the
memorable
congressional
statute
requires
that
the
proceeding
be
in
a
state
court
and
if
it
is
not
in
a
state
court
then
of
course
its
possible
to
get
an
injunction
against
a
threatened
prosecution.
now,
this
court
has
seven
related
cases
involving
injunctions
by
three
--
either
denial
or
granting
of
injunctions
by
the
three-judge
district
courts
below.
the
first
case,
number
4,
harris
against
younger,
in
that
case
the
court
--
the
three-judge
court
did
grant
an
injunction
and
one
of
the
three
applicants
for
the
injunction,
harris,
had
an
indictment
pending
against
him.
there
you
have
a
question
of
a
clear
cut
violation
of
the
provisions
of
2283
in
connection
with
the
other
two
applicants,
broslawsky,
dan
and
hirsch,
nobody
indicted
them.
and
our
interpretation
of
2283
is
that
so
far
as
enjoining
the
district
attorney
if
los
angeles
county
from
commencing
a
prosecution
against
professor
broslawsky
or
the
labor
union
leaders,
dan
and
hirsch,
that
2283
doesn't
effect
because
there
was
no
proceeding
in
a
state
court.
boyle
against
landry
as
i
understand
it,
there
was
no
pending
case
in
the
state
court
so
i'm
question
--
i
question
whether
2283
has
any
application
there.
in
our
case
we
had
indictments,
this
indictment
pending
in
a
state
court
for
265
days
with
58,
59,
60
motions
made
before
application
was
made
to
the
federal
tribunal.
next
case
after
this
gone
--
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
these
indictments
were
returned
on
june
20th,
1967
your
honor.
that's
--
and
application
was
made
--
the
first
indictments
--
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
--
the
superseding
indictment
january
20th,
1968,
march
12th,
1968,
application
first
made
for
the
first
time
to
a
federal
district
court.
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
about
june,
i
don't
have
the
exact
date
at
the
moment,
june
1968,
your
honor,
june
1968.
this
case
was
ordered,
reargued
that
may
account
for
it.
the
next
case
gunn
against
university
committee
is
not
yet
argued
yet.
again,
there
you
had
no
pending
prosecution
because
the
state
tribunal
had
dismissed
it.
dyson
against
bachelor
(ph)
--
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
about
june
of
1968
and
this
case
--
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
no,
injunction
was
denied.
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
i
--
we
did
prosecute
two
of
these
men
and
--
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
the
reason
is
that
they
--
it
was
agreed
that
the
gist
--
well,
to
be
very
honest,
an
assistant
district
attorney
in
our
office
agreed
with
other
side
without
my
knowing
about
it
and
without
district
attorney
mackell
who
is
here
in
court
knowing
about
it.
that
he
would
await
the
outcome
of
the
decision
from
this
tribunal.
that's
why.
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
when
it
had
--
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
--
and
was
--
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
on
the
conspiracy
to
commit
murder
in
a
separate
--
the
second,
the
separate
indictment.
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
and
they
were
convicted
in
june,
the
month
that
--
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
--
that
senator
kennedy
was
assassinated.
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
conspiracy
to
commit
murder.
they're
also
involved
in
this
--
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
of
two
named
persons.
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
we
had
two
indictments
based
on
the
same
grand
jury
managed
mr.
chief
justice.
one
was
the
present
indictment
involving
the
15
defendants.
the
other
was
against
two
defendants
who
are
also
included
in
these
15.
the
second
indictment
was
to
conspiracy
to
commit
murder
in
the
first
degree.
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
we
proceeded
and
tried
them
because
no
application
was
made
to
a
federal
tribunal.
they
were
convicted
and
they
--
that
case
is
now
pending
in
this
court
for
certiorari
under
1668
miscellaneous.
it's
on
your
docket.
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
the
charges
in
the
first
indictment
where
the
possession
of
these
weapons
and
41
of
its
48
counts
conspiracy
to
commit
arson
in
one
of
the
48
counts
--
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
there
were
41
separate
weapons.
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
that's
right.
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
yes,
your
honor.
under
the
law
of
the
state
of
new
york.
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
for
10
of
the
15
appellants
in
this
case.
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
i
can't
in
one
indictment
proceed
against
you
under
certain
counts
and
let
the
rest
hang
in
advance.
i
can't
sever
it.
our
state
courts
will
--
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
because
they'll
regard
that
as
double
jeopardy,
they'll
say
jeopardy
attaches
if
you
go
ahead
with
one
count
in
an
indictment
and
dispose
of
it
by
conviction,
you
can
never
prosecute
for
the
others.
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
we
did
not
anticipate
at
the
time
this
indictment
was
returned
that
there
will
be
any
resort
to
the
federal
court.
this
is
a
supers
--
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
i
wouldn't
want
to
amend
--
to
put
this
case
in
before
a
grand
jury
again
while
it's
pending
in
a
federal
tribunal.
i
think
that
would
be
a
little
unfair.
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
because
i
think
it
would
frustrate
--
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
they
are,
there's
no
question
about
it
but
--
may
i
add
also
but
i
do
not
want
to
prejudice
any
of
these
appellants.
some
of
these
appellants
in
matters
did
--
not
connected
with
criminal
anarchy,
are
under
pending
indictments
in
our
county
alone.
so
we
have
a
rope
around
them.
i
may
add
this
too
if
i
may
that
this
type
of
interruption
of
a
state
criminal
proceeding
does
not
give
the
state
the
opportunity
to
refine
the
charges
in
the
indictment.
now,
in
the
most
re
--
brandenburg
case,
this
court
pointed
out
that
there
was
no
refinement
of
the
charge
in
that
case
either
by
the
trial
judge
or
by
the
highest
court
of
the
state
of
ohio.
in
our
case
there
are
many
more
stages
of
refinement
that
this
proceeding
has
interrupted.
for
example,
at
page
89
of
the
appendix
to
my
brief,
section
295,
i
think
it
is
(g)
of
the
code
of
criminal
procedure,
says
mandatorily
in
the
form
of
the
indictment
that
we
used
which
is
a
short
form
indictment,
mandatorily
the
district
attorney
shall
deliver
a
bill
of
particulars
to
the
defendant
provided
he
applies
to
the
judge
for
one.
the
first
stage
of
refinement
is
that
we
would
have
to
particularize
what
we
rely
on
to
convict
this
defendant
and
we
must
do
so
mandatorily.
it's
not
in
the
discretion
of
a
judge,
state
court
judge
to
deny
a
bill
of
particulars.
second,
at
the
trial
of
this
case,
the
trial
judge
will
have
to
give
instructions
to
the
jury.
at
that
time
he
can
clearly
state
and
incorporate
anything
that
has
been
laid
down
by
this
court
in
brandenburg
and
by
the
highest
court
of
our
state
in
epton.
third,
the
highest
court
of
the
state
will
reveal
this
conviction
and
we're
reminded
in
--
that
1947
case
coming
from
new
york
county
against
new
york,
the
opinion
by
justice
reed,
the
name,
it
forgets
me,
i
worked
on
the
case
myself.
that
if
the
highest
court
of
a
state
amends
a
statute
by
construing
it
then
those
words
of
the
highest
court
of
the
state
must
be
taken
to
be
part
of
the
state
statute
itself.
thank
you.
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
just
because
you're
attempting
to
overthrow
the
government,
it
seems
to
me
does
not
give
you
a
broader
privilege
to
use
force
than
if
you're
committing
an
ordinary
crime
of
robbery.
now,
as
between
robbery
and
criminal
anarchy,
there
is
this
distinction,
if
a
robber
sets
out
and
succeeds
in
getting
the
loot,
taking
it
from
a
crime,
he
is
not
home
free
because
he
may
later
be
apprehended
and
put
in
jail.
but
if
an
anarchist
overthrows
the
local
government,
sets
out
to
do
it
and
succeeds,
then
he
is
home
free.
there's
an
epigram
from
sir
john
harington
in
the
17th
century,
it's
just
two
lines,
he
says,
“treason
doth
never
succeed.
what's
the
reason?
for
if
treason
succeed,
none
dare
call
it
treason.”
in
other
words,
the
person
who
succeeds
in
overthrowing
the
government
has
bought
themselves
amnesty
and
immunity.
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
proceeding
in
the
state
court,
state
of
new
york,
county
of
queens,
queens
is
one
of
62
counties
in
new
york
state,
its
part
of
new
york
city,
has
a
population
of
about
five
--
two
million.
it's
the
fifth
largest
county
in
the
united
states.
it
began
so
far
as
i
know
with
an
investigation
by
the
police
of
the
city
of
new
york
in
october
of
1965
that
was
two
years
--
a
year
and
several
months
before
we
were
in
office
in
the
district
attorney
of
queens
county.
it
stemmed
from
activity
of
the
flq,
a
quebec
revolutionary
organization
which
attempted
to
blowup
the
statue
of
liberty
and
resulted
in
three
convictions.
for
some
reason,
the
police
continued
their
investigation
with
this
group
in
queens
and
this
investigation
went
into
the
black
brother
improvement
society.
several
undercover
men
from
new
york
city
police
were
assigned.
one
of
them
became
a
member,
a
member
of
the
board
of
directors,
vice-president
and
was
in
on
all
high
conspiracies.
nobody
came
to
the
district
attorney
from
the
police
until
april
of
1967,
and
at
that
time
they
indicated
how
things
had
progressed.
they
have
progressed
beyond
the
mere
advocacy,
the
naked
advocacy
of
overthrowing
of
local
establishment.
they
had
reached
the
point
where
they
had
accumulated
weapons,
cans
of
gasoline,
cans
of
oil,
black
powder
to
explode,
blueprints,
and
had
designated
areas
that
were
to
be
blown
up.
they
had
even
devised
a
timetable,
they
had
engaged
in
training
programs
for
the
use
of
these
things.
even
then,
the
district
attorney
did
not
move
until
they
held
a
dry
run
that
wasn't
so
dry
because
four
shots
were
fired
in
the
jamaica
section
of
queens
on
june
16,
1967.
furthermore,
they
had
now
formulated
and
made
definite
a
second
conspiracy
that
involved
only
three
people,
ferguson,
harris,
and
this
undercover
policeman
and
this
conspiracy
was
to
kill
two
moderate
civil
rights
leaders,
whitney
young
and
roy
wilkins,
they
had
gone
quite
far,
they
had
already
acquired
the
weapons,
they
had
devised
the
plan,
they
had
cased
roy
wilkins
house
who
unfortunately
lived
in
a
sort
of
cul-de-sac
about
a
mile
from
the
courthouse
in
queens.
now
we
then
proceeded
and
presented
this
case
to
a
grand
jury.
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
this
--
mr.
frederick
j.
ludwig
this
was
presented
to
the
grand
jury
on
june
20,
1967
and
we
have
nothing
in
the
record
on
these
facts.
this
court
is
forced
to
rely
on
my
say-so
and
that's
because
of
this
anticipatory
nature
of
reveal
with
one
exception.
we
presented
the
matter
to
the
grand
jury
and
it
was
no
special
grand
jury.
it
was
an
ordinary
grand
jury.
i
just
happened
to
be
sitting
that
day
on
june
20th
and
they
returned
two
indictments.
and
i'll
dispose
of
one
of
those
indictments
because
this
court
has
already
done
so
on
june
29th
of
this
year.
and
that
was
the
indictment
of
ferguson
and
harris
who
are
two
of
the
appellants
here.
ferguson
and
harris
were
charged
with
conspiracy
to
commit
murder
in
the
first
degree
against
whitney
young
and
roy
wilkins.
they
were
brought
to
trial
on
a
superseded
indictment
that
was
returned
in
february
of
1968
on
this
judge
before
a
judge
and
jury.
they
were
convicted
in
june
of
1968.
they
went
through
two
appellate
courts
and
unanimously
12
appellate
judges
in
new
york,
5
from
the
appellate
division
and
7
from
the
court
of
appeals
found
there
was
proof
and
sufficient
proof
all
the
way
through,
beyond
a
unreasonable
doubt
there
were
some
dissents
over
whether
a
continuance
shouldn't
have
been
granted
in
that
trial.
they
applied
for
certiorari
to
this
court
and
there
you
did
have
trial
record
to
review
and
this
court
denied
certiorari
on
june
29th.
there
is
just
this
minor
appendix.
justice
holly
continued
these
two
on
bail
until
this
court
dispose
off
their
application
for
review.
they
have
not
surrendered
since
june
29th.
they
have
been
indicted
for
jumping
bail
in
the
first
degree.
they
may
be
in
algeria
right
now.
and
yet
we
have
counsel
here
asking
this
court
to
review
an
equitable
determination
below
when
two
of
the
persons
they
represent
in
a
single
petition
are
coming
in
to
say
the
least
with
unclean
hands.
the
questions
now
before
this
court,
is
not
an
accusation
by
the
district
attorney
mackell
or
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
new
york.
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
new
york
had
nothing.
whatever
they
do
with
this
case,
mr.
mackell
did
not
present
it
to
the
grand
jury.
what
they
are
complaining
about
is
an
indictment
by
a
grand
jury
in
new
york
and
that
grand
jury
consisted
of
22
persons
on
june
20
of
1967.
it
was
the
same
grand
jury
that
superseded
its
first
indictment
on
june
15,
1968.
now
what
does
an
indictment
mean
in
new
york?
in
new
york,
an
indictment
means
that
you
must
--
the
new
york
state
constitution,
article
i,
section
6
has
the
identical
words
of
its
opening
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment
of
the
federal
constitution
that
“nobody
is
going
to
stand
trial
except
on
indictment
or
presentment
of
a
grand
jury”.
but
the
new
york
legislature
has
been
much
stricter
about
that
requirement
than
has
congress
or
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure.
the
new
york
legislature
says
that
no
indictment
can
be
amended
and
that
even
if
a
person
when
he
is
first
arrested
comes
in
and
pleads
guilty
his
plea
is
a
nullity
because
he
can
not
plead
to
a
felony
unless
he
has
been
indicted
and
accused
by
a
grand
jury.
moreover,
his
lawyer
cannot
come
in
and
say,
“we'll
waive
the
indictment.
let's
plead
out
to
something
else.”
not
permitted
in
new
york
and
i
don't
have
this
in
my
brief,
i
just
make
the
brief
reference
to
people
ex
rel.
wachowicz
against
martin,
293
n.y.
361.
this
is
the
procedure
in
new
york.
now
what
quantum
of
proof
is
required
before
a
grand
jury
in
new
york?
we
have
costello
against
the
united
states,
a
case
decided
by
this
court
10,
12
years
ago
where
they
said
a
grand
jury
--
a
federal
grand
jury
can
indict
on
hearsay,
pure
100%
hearsay.
the
testimony
of
an
accountant
in
an
income
tax
rebate
investigation,
100%
hearsay
that's
a
sufficient
indictment
in
the
federal
court.
by
statute,
section
249
of
our
code
of
criminal
procedure
provides
that
the
grand
jury
can
receive
none
but
legal
evidence.
section
251
of
the
same
code
says
that
the
grand
jury
cannot
indict
unless
the
evidence
before
it
if
unexplained
or
uncontradicted
would
be
sufficient
to
warrant
a
trial
jury
to
convict.
finally,
section
389
of
the
same
code
by
statute
proscribes
the
standard
of
proof
for
a
trial
jury
and
it
provides
that
the
defendant
is
presumed
to
be
innocent
and
if
there
is
any
reasonable
doubt
about
whether
he
is
guilt
is
satisfactory
shown,
he
is
entitled
to
an
acquittal.
those
are
the
standards
that
apply
to
the
grand
jury.
beyond
that,
22
people
on
the
grand
jury
found
this
proof
beyond
unreasonable
doubt
in
coming
down
with
this
48-count
indictment.
now
beyond
that,
you
are
entitled
to
judicial
review
with
the
trial
court
level
about
what
the
grand
jury
does.
and
here
apparently,
the
legislature
has
been
very
liberal
in
conferring
upon
one
supreme
court,
state
supreme
court
justice
enormous
power
over
the
grand
jury.
in
section
671,
it
says
that
regardless
of
whether
the
defendant
makes
a
motion
or
not,
if
the
judge
thinks
in
furtherance
of
justice
this
indictment
should
be
set
aside.
he
has
the
power
to
do
it.
now
these
applications
had
been
made
under
the
superseded
indictment
and
they
have
been
denied
by
several
judges
on
the
state
court
level.
now
that's
how
far
this
case
has
proceeded
in
the
state
courts.
this
case
was
in
the
state
courts
from
june
20,
1967
until
march
12,
1968
when
application
was
made
to
the
three-judge
court.
now
it
has
been
in
the
federal
courts
for
979
days
counting
today,
979
days.
now
there
are
two
facets
to
this
case
and
i
think
they
stand
from
ex
parte
young
and
justice
brennan's
opinion
in
dombrowski
and
as
dombrowski
laid
down.
first
of
all,
this
is
anticipatory
federal
relief,
expediting
federal
relief.
judge
brennan,
i
think
says,
if
you
have
a
statute
that's
overbroad
or
vague
on
its
face
or
if
there
is
bad
faith
in
applying
a
statute
that
might
otherwise
be
valid
on
either
of
those
grounds
in
dombrowski.
justice
brennan
said
the
federal
courts
may
grant
anticipatory
relief
as
they
did
in
ex
parte
young
on
a
question
of
economic
due
process.
later
justice
brennan
in
cameron
2
in
1968
seemed
to
say
that
dombrowski
rested
primarily
on
the
second
of
those
two
horns
and
he
said
that
i
think
--
and
he
referred
to
the
facts
in
dombrowski,
where
there
had
been
arrest
where
there
had
been
raids,
where
had
been
seizure
of
materials
under
some
communist
control
act,
and
these
has
all
been
quashed
by
the
state
courts
in
louisiana.
and
not
withstanding
that,
the
state
legislative
committee
under
pfister
and
other
people
continued
the
investigation
and
that
was
the
sign
of
bad
faith
so
far
as
state
action
was
concerned.
now
in
this
case,
i
don't
think
you
can
come
in
on
the
first
of
the
two
grounds
in
dombrowski
for
several
reasons.
first
of
all
in
epton,
which
was
decided
on
may
16,
1967,
this
indictment,
june
20,
1967,
a
month
and
five
days
later.
epton
qualified
narrowing
the
construction
of
the
old
criminal
anarchy
statute
in
new
york
that
had
been
upheld
by
the
way
in
gitlow
against
new
york.
there
had
been
a
prior
prosecution
on
writ
1922.
in
upholding
it,
they
said,
“first
of
all,
the
mere
advocacy
of
criminal
anarchy
is
out.”
the
court
of
appeals
said.
second,
they
said,
“you
not
only
have
to
advocate
the
overthrow
of
government
but
you
have
to
have
an
impact
to
overthrow
the
government
that
must
accompany
that
advocacy.”
and
third,
they
said,
“there
has
to
be
clear
and
present
danger.”
everywhere
in
this
indictment
that
we
talked
about,
those
first
four
counts,
criminal
anarchy,
everywhere
we
talked
about
that
in
this
indictment,
we
shrink
it
down
to
the
very
narrowest
possible
dimensions.
we
identified
the
general
targets
as
the
state
of
new
york
or
the
political
subdivisions
of
the
state
or
the
executive
officials
of
the
state.
we
identified
particular
targets
in
there
as
publicly-owned
and
operated
transportation
facilities
in
the
city
of
new
york
and
publicly
and
streets,
manholes
of
the
city
of
new
york
with
plans,
detailed
blueprints
to
pour
gasoline
had
already
been
made
and
we
identified
the
means.
every
time
we
allege
these
things
in
this
pleading
before
the
court,
we
identified
the
means
as
force
and
violence
to
wit
the
use
of
bombs,
shotguns,
rifles,
gasoline,
gunpowder,
etcetera,
all
the
way
through.
consequently,
i
don't
see
how
when
this
court
considered
people
against
epton,
i
believe
in
january
of
1968,
both
appeal
and
certiorari
and
this
court
denied
review
of
people
against
epton.
justice
douglas
if
i
can
remember,
i
have
to
remember
back
in
writing
a
rather
lucid
dissent.
his
only
objection
if
i
can
recall
was
to
what
the
trial
judge
did
in
the
epton
case.
he
said
the
trial
judge
had
submitted
a
great
many
overt
acts
to
the
jury
and
some
of
those
overt
acts
were
in
the
area
of
protected
speech,
if
i
recall
justice
douglas's
dissent
from
the
denial
of
certiorari.
so
the
epton
case
has
already
been
narrowly
--
the
epton
case
has
narrowly
construed
the
statute.
now,
you
asked,
well,
what
about
the
bad
faith
in
this
case?
we
did
not
accuse
anybody
in
this
case.
none
of
the
15
defendants
were
accused
by
the
district,
neither
were
they
accused
by
this
grand
jury.
and
if
there
is
any
bad
faith,
the
bad
faith
lies
on
the
part
of
that
cross-section
of
the
community,
those
22
persons.
but
there
is
no
bad
faith
in
this
case.
any
question
about
publicity
has
been
reviewed
fully
by
the
state
courts
bellow
with
lengthy
opinions
written.
one
of
them
is
appended
in
my
brief
by
one
of
the
justices
on
the
state
court.
and
besides,
if
the
only
complaint
is
about
some
publicity,
remedies
lie
for
change
of
venue
with
the
time
of
trial
not
by
anticipatory
federal
relief.
we
are
asked
why
we
have
to
have
these
four
counts
relating
to
criminal
anarchy,
three
substantive
criminal
anarchy,
and
one
on
the
conspiracy
to
commit
criminal
anarchy,
which
is
a
misdemeanor.
and
i
have
previously
told
the
court
on
two
occasions
that
the
weapons
law
of
new
york
differentiates
between
handguns
and
shoulder
guns.
for
handguns,
mere
possession
is
alone
enough.
for
shoulder
guns,
you
must
prove
both
possession
and
intent
to
use
unlawful
guns
to
another.
37
of
41
of
the
counts
of
these
48
count
indictment
deal
with
that.
there's
a
second
reason
and
a
very
important
reason.
and
this
reason
goes
back
to
a
unanimous
opinion
of
this
court
written
by
justice
black,
cole
against
arkansas
where
he
said,
that
you
have
to
give
notice
in
advance
a
track
of
anything
you
intend
to
prove
at
that
trial.
we
would
necessarily
have
to
bring
in
this
conspiracy
to
overthrow
local
government
in
the
trial
for
the
possession
of
37
of
the
41
weapons
in
this
case.
if
you
remember
in
cole
against
arkansas,
the
defendant
was
charged
under
one
section
of
a
state
statute.
that
was
the
accusation.
he
was
tried
and
not
convicted
on
that
but
the
highest
court
of
arkansas
affirmed
this
conviction
another
section
of
the
statute.
they
found
there
was
sufficient
evidence
and
this
court
objected
and
the
opening
words
of
the
quote
that
i
have
in
mind
from
justice
black
was
that
there
is
nothing
more
fundamental
to
due
process
of
law
and
this
goes
back
to
(inaudible),
then
that
person
who
is
entitled
to
be
accused
in
advance.
we
had
a
case
in
queens
about
a
year
ago
where
three
murders
occurred.
it
was
a
division
of
spoils
of
a
robbery
that
was
committed
on
july
1,
1968.
on
july
4,
1968,
these
three
murders
among
the
thieves
had
occurred
and
there
were
indictments
for
murders,
but
no
indictment
for
robbery.
and
in
the
course
of
trying
this
case,
it
would
have
been
necessary
to
refer
to
the
fact
that
the
defendant
was
one
of
the
participants
in
this
robbery
and
that
there
was
a
dispute
over
the
spoils.
the
gasoline
station
owner
claimed
that
$11,000.00
have
been
taken
from
his
safe.
the
man
--
the
bad
man
among
the
robbers
had
only
$6,000.00.
so,
that
lead
to
the
murder
of
three
of
the
robbers.
but
because
it
was
necessary
to
refer
to
that
robbery
and
to
the
participation
of
these
persons
in
it,
an
indictment
was
filed
for
robbery
and
during
the
course
of
the
trial,
many
references
were
made
to
the
robbery
but
defense
counsel
could
not
stand
up
and
scream
that
they
had
never
been
accused
of
a
robbery.
nobody
had
ever
accused
them
of
robbery
and
that
is
the
reason
we
have
to
have
these
other
counts
in
the
indictment.
we
do
not
concede
as
mr.
rabinowitz
supposes
that
the
doctrine
of
abstention
ought
not
to
be
applied
here.
we
do
not
concede
that
at
all.
we
think
our
position
is
completely
consistent
with
dombrowski,
with
ex
parte
young
and
no
grounds
have
been
out
why
there
should
be
no
abstention
in
this
case.
the
major
point
we
would
like
to
make
is
that
the
statute
that's
alleged
to
be
unconstitutional
in
new
york
as
part
of
the
comprehensive
reorganization
of
our
penal
law
in
new
york
was
repealed
on
july
20,
1965.
that
repealed
to
take
effect
on
september
1,
1967.
that's
the
criminal
anarchy
statute
we
are
talking
about.
so
its
future
chilling
effect
has
stopped
and
ceased
on
september
1,
1967.
it
had
to
be
applied
to
these
defendants
because
the
conduct
we
allege
to
be
criminal
on
their
part
occurred
between
october
1965
and
june
20,
1967,
sometime
before
september
1,
1967.
so
the
future
emanations
so
far
as
potential
offenders
of
this
law
are
concerned,
it
no
longer
exist
and
have
not
existed
and
did
not
exist
at
the
time
the
application
was
made
for
the
federal
court
on
march
12,
1968.
there
had
been
no
more
criminal
anarchy
statute
that's
complained
about
enforced
in
effect
in
new
york.
so
the
potential
harm,
the
chilling
effect
that
might
emanate
from
this
statute
ceased
long
before
in
the
application
was
made
for
federal
relief
in
this
case.
i
should
like
to
point
out
that
apart
from
abstention,
we
have
of
course
2283
and
this
is
the
historic
of
act
1793
that
congress
enacted
as
an
amendment
to
the
fundamental
judiciary
law
of
7089.
and
the
three
words
in
1983
of
title
42
“suit
in
equity”
do
not
really
constitute
and
can
not
arguably
be
made
as
a
question
of
statutory
interpretation
and
exception
to
the
expressly
authorized
by
congress.
that's
what
congress
required
in
1948
when
they
re-codified
2283.
they
want
an
expressly
authorized
exception.
now
i
have
kept
notes
for
many
years
and
what
i
think
or
expressly
authorized
exceptions
to
2283.
this
would
be
the
second
title.
the
first
title
is
the
doctrine
of
abstention.
even
if
you
get
by
abstention,
this
case
unlike
dombrowski
involves
a
pending
proceeding
in
the
state
court
that
was
pending
from
june
20,
1967
until
march
12,
1968.
here
are
the
kinds
of
exceptions
that
i
think
this
court
has
allowed
has
expressly
authorized.
where
you
have
in
the
statute
an
authorization
to
state
any
state
court
proceeding.
you
have
that
in
the
habeas
corpus
act
and
you
have
that
in
the
interpleader
act
of
1926.
it
says
that
the
district
court
congress
says
gives
them
the
power
to
state
any
state
court
proceeding
or
any
federal
court
proceeding,
both
in
the
habeas
corpus
act
and
the
interpleader
act
of
1926.
another
formula
is
a
provision
that
they
can
state
any
court
proceeding
but
without
reference
the
state
court
and
that
appears
in
the
bankruptcy
act
and
the
frazier-lemke
act,
farm-mortgage
act.
thirdly,
--
third
says
that
all
proceedings
shall
cease.
this
appears
in
the
old
shipowners'
liability
act
of
1851.
a
fourth
proceeding
is
that
the
state
court
shall
proceed
no
further
and
that
appears
in
the
federal
removal
statute.
i
would
like
to
add
two
more.
these
four,
i
have
motioned
in
my
brief.
i
would
like
to
add
two
more
that
my
research
has
turned
up
since.
i
have
worked
on
the
brief
and
that
is
the
federal
civil
rights
act
of
1964
has
a
prohibition
with
respect
to
use
of
public
accommodations.
it
has
a
prohibition
to
punish
or
attempt
to
punish
any
person
from
exercising
any
right
or
privilege
secured
by
that
public
accommodation
civil
rights
act
of
1964.
and
it
couples
this
with
authorization
for
injunctive
relief
to
see
that
this
is
carried
out.
now
that
is
what
i
mean
expressly
authorized
by
congress.
that
appears
in
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964,
title
42
of
the
united
states
code,
section
2000
(a)
subdivision
2
(c)
and
(a)
subdivision
3
(a).
and
the
fifth
circuit
in
dilworth
against
riner,
343
f.
2d
226
has
sustained
that
as
an
authorized
exception.
finally,
you
have
an
exception
that's
also,
i
think
ought
to
be
added
and
even
half
dozen.
you
have
an
exception
in
the
right
to
vote
act
when
the
federal
government
moves
into
the
federal
district
court
and
asked
for
an
injunction
against
state
officials
or
state
proceedings
that
interfere
with
a
person's
right
to
vote.
this
comes
from
48
united
states
code
1971
(c).
those
i
think
are
what
we
mean
by
expressly
authorized
exceptions.
now
the
american
law
institute
is
not
congress
but
they
have
been
studying
this
question
of
division
of
jurisdiction
between
state
and
federal
courts.
and
it
has
been
represented
to
this
court
that
they
are
in
favor
of
the
dombrowski
type
of
intervention
at
the
district
court
level.
but
i
find
that
the
american
law
institute
reading
that
draft
on
sections
1371
and
1372
do
not
favor,
do
not
feel
that
dombrowski
authorizes
this
injunctions
and
quite
the
contrary
in
their
have
proposed
section
1371
(c).
they
go
back
to
ashwander
against
the
tva
and
all
of
those
cases
that
support
abstention
of
the
federal
district
court.
finally,
on
this
point
of
the
bar
of
section
2283,
we
might
look
at
what
congress
has
said
in
other
situations
so
far
as
anticipatory
relief
is
concerned
in
the
federal
courts
vis-à-vis
state
court
proceedings.
the
power
of
a
federal
district
court
to
abort,
to
prevent
the
natural
fruition,
the
natural
development
of
a
state
court
proceeding.
one,
we
have
the
removal
statute
and
this
court
has
been
very
strict
on
removal
statute,
most
recent
determination
in
city
of
greenwood
against
peacock.
they
indicate
how
strict
they
are
before
you
can
remove
a
case
that's
already
in
the
federal
court.
that
removal
would
be
under
1443
subdivision
1.
on
the
other
hand,
this
court
has
been
willing
to
allow
removal
where
in
it
is
very
clear
that
the
basis
is
strictly
and
solely
one
of
color,
not
general
civil
rights
but
color
and
this
court
carefully
pointed
that
out
in
rachel
against
georgia
in
volume
384
in
1966.
so
we
do
not
have
the
power
to
abort
any
state
proceedings
from
the
removal
act.
one
of
two
different
remedies
that
this
court
has
in
addition
to
the
injunction
and
declaratory
judgment
asked
here.
next
is
the
question
of
habeas
corpus,
there
is
you
examine
that
very
carefully,
you
would
find
that
habeas
corpus
is
permitted
only
--
the
exhaustion
of
state
remedies
requirement
in
the
statute
which
appears
in
section
2254
of
title
28
appears
only
explicitly
by
the
wording
of
congress
to
apply
to
post-conviction,
post-state
conviction
for
a
remedy.
but
this
court
many
years
ago
in
ex
parte
royal
in
1886
extended
it
to
pre-conviction
and
this
court
has
never
interfered
with
that
interpretation
on
the
restriction
of
federal
habeas
corpus
to
get
relief
for
defendant
in
the
toils
of
the
state
criminal
process.
finally,
this
court
itself
is
a
constitutional
tribunal
but
its
jurisdiction
over
appellate
matters
is
fixed
by
congress
under
article
3
of
the
constitution.
and
if
you
examine
the
requirements
in
this
court
in
order
to
review
state
determinations,
one
thing
above
everything
else
stands
up
and
that
is
that
the
state
court,
the
state
judgment
must
be
a
final
judgment.
this
court
has
used
this
terms.
the
statute
provides
that
in
section
1257.
it
must
be
the
final
word
of
a
final
court.
otherwise,
this
court
has
no
power
to
interfere
with
anything
a
state
tribunal
does
below.
and
this
is
a
constitutional
tribunal,
the
federal
district
courts
are
creatures
of
congress
that
congress
tomorrow
could
abolish
the
federal
district
courts
without
any
need
of
constitutional
amendment.
under
those
circumstances,
i
would
suggest
that
this
court
called
upon
as
they
are
to
make
an
exception
for
section
2283
in
the
light
of
the
existence
of
all
our
federal
statute
and
also
and
especially
because
of
the
delay
that
will
attend
state
criminal
proceedings
as
is
evidence
by
this
case,
979
days
till
today
this
case
has
been
in
the
federal
court.
thank
you.
