justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
quite
understand
you,
mr.
rabinowitz,
maybe
i
misread
gitlow,
i
haven't
read
that
opinion
recently.
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
the
statute's
constitutionality
was
upheld
in
the
gitlow
case?
justice
potter
stewart
so
how
can
you
say
that
everybody
agrees
that
this
is
an
unconstitutional
statute?
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
only
time
it's
come
to
this
court
has
been
upheld.
justice
potter
stewart
except
for
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that
was
that
statute
that
was
before
the
court
of
the
gitlow
case?
justice
potter
stewart
of
course
the
point
in
the
shuttlesworth
was
a
little
different
as
you
know.
it
involved
the
fact
that
the
licensing
authority
could
not
be
charged
with
clairvoyance.
if
the
licensing
authority
thought
that
he
had
absolutely
unbridled
discretion
in
the
question
of
whether
or
not
to
grant
a
license
for
a
parade.
it
wasn't
the
so
much
the
petitioner's
clairvoyance.
at
least
that's
the
way
i
understood
the
opinion.
i
did
write
it,
you
know.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
did
judge
friendly
rely
on
that,
i
forgot
if
he
ever
got
to
it?
justice
potter
stewart
i
--
justice
potter
stewart
he
didn't
mention
that
then?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
right,
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
you
say
there's
one
count
of
conspiracy?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
by
the
one
before
that.
conspiracy
i
think
you
said
to
commit
anarchy?
justice
potter
stewart
i
didn't
know
that
anarchy
was
something
you
could
commit.
i
thought
that
was
a
state
of
existence.
justice
potter
stewart
what
is
--
which
count
are
you
--
do
you
remember
the
number
of
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
number
five,
right.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
these
--
these
statutes
i
gather
from
you
and
from
mr.
rabinowitz
were
directly
an
issue
in
the
keyishian
case,
were
they?
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
know
i
did
not
join
that
opinion,
and
i
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
i
didn't
--
justice
potter
stewart
some
of
us
didn't,
but
where
these
statutes
directly
at
issue
in
the
keyishian
case?
justice
potter
stewart
well
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
see
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
supposedly
incorporated
this
by
reference.
justice
potter
stewart
and
how
did
that
evidence
get
into
this
case?
i
thought
this
was
an
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
this
is
part
of
this
case
--
the
real
evidence
in
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
in
the
record?
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
mr.
ludwig
this
case
was
decided
basically
on
the
plea
on
a
complaint
to
which
was
attached
a
copy
of
indictment
and
then
on
an
answer?
justice
potter
stewart
that
there
was
no
evidence
as
such
and
it
is
there'd
be
no
real
evidence.
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
seller
is
directly
liable
to
the
state
to
return
this
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
tax
purports
at
least
to
be
imposed
upon
the
transaction,
isn't
it
rather
than
on
the
property?
it's
upon
the
transaction
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
the
sale
measured
by
the
value
of
the
property
sold.
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
i
remember
in
the
--
in
your
opposing
counsel's
brief
that
connecticut
imposes
a
sales
tax
on
the
rental
of
motel
rooms,
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
it
hardly
would
fall
under
the
language
would
it?
justice
potter
stewart
but
it
does
i
think
--
i
think
counsel
for
the
state
makes
that
point
to
emphasize
his
position
that
the
tax
is
imposed
upon
the
transaction
and
that
rather
than
being
a
tax
on
property.
justice
potter
stewart
that
could
be.
that
could
be
by
a
robbery
indictment
or
a
blackmail
indictment,
i
mean,
you
could
simply
allege
that
i
was
exercising
my
right
of
free
speech
on
the
street
corner
and
as
a
result
of
which
this
policeman
came
up
and
arrested
me
for
blackmail
or
for
robbery.
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
really
see
why.
i
mean
that
could
be
very
true.
it
could
be
an
abuse
of
the
black
--
criminal
laws
against
blackmail
in
the
particular
jurisdiction.
a
policeman
might
just
get
in
a
habit
or
any
time
he
saw
somebody
making
a
speech
on
street
corner
to
walk
up
to
him
and
arrest
him
for
blackmail.
justice
potter
stewart
so
it's
not
--
it
does
--
it
can
come
within
this
statute
in
your
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
cannot?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
no,
i
just
wondered
if
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
wondered
if
your
argument
--
how
you
would
react
to
--
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
true
throughout
the
state
of
new
york?
justice
potter
stewart
that
before
a
grand
jury
can
bring
an
indictment,
there
has
to
be
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
at
least
prima
--
at
least
unexplained.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
now
aren't
a
good
many
prosecutions
in
your
state
initiated
by
way
of
information?
justice
potter
stewart
none
of
the

--
justice
potter

cannot
be

justice
potter
stewart
i

misdemeanors
not

it's
