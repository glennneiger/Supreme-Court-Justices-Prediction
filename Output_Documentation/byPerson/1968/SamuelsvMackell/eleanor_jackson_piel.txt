ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
if
it
please
the
court.
my
client
is
one
of
the
15
persons
indicted
in
this
case.
and
he
has
somewhat
of
a
unique
position,
because
although
there
are
48
counts
to
the
indictment,
he
is
charged
with
four
counts
--
three
counts
of
the
substantive
anarchy.
one,
of
the
conspiracy
to
commit
anarchy,
and
one
count
which
by
itself
does
not
seem
very
serious
but
is
conspiracy
to
commit
arson
in
the
third
degree.
now,
this
will
become
significant
in
terms
of
my
argument,
although
it
may
not
be
as
significant
as
to
the
other
appellants
in
this
case.
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
to
commit
arson
in
the
third
degree.
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
to
commit
anarchy,
yes.
there
are
four
--
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
well,
i've
had
such
a
long
association
with
anarchy.
i
finally
decided
that
perhaps
committing
is
the
term
to
be
used.
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
five.
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
five
is
the
--
no,
four
is
the
conspiracy
to
commit
anarchy
and
fifth
one
is
arson.
and
interestingly
enough,
you
will
note
there
are
--
that
the
overt
acts
that
the
--
that
all
through
the
anarchy
counts,
you
find
the
dissemination
of
ideas
by
word,
by
distributing
pamphlets.
you
find
assemblage.
you
find
that
kind
of
thing
all
the
way
through.
but
i
want
to
get
back
to
what
we
claim
--
what
i
claim
in
this
appeal.
this
is
a
two
--
a
double
barreled
attack
not
only
on
the
anarchy
statutes
but
also
on
the
grand
jury
statutes
in
the
state
of
new
york.
and
they
go
together
very
well
here,
because
you
have
black
people,
negroes
accused
of
political
crimes
and
they
are
indicted
by
a
predominantly
white
middle-class
grand
jury
which
is
chosen
by
statutorily
set
of
subjective
standards.
now,
i
want
to
go
back
a
little
bit
to
the
history
with
regard
to
this
anarchy
statute
and
what
happened
to
it.
it
was
passed
as
you
know
in
1902,
and
it
came
to
glory
as
it
were
in
1920
when
in
february
mr.
gitlow
was
convicted
of
anarchy.
even
though
as
you
all
recall,
he
was
a
socialist.
it
went
through
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
in
1922
when
that
court
gave
a
ringing
opinion
saying
that
the
state
had
a
right
to
protect
not
only
itself
but
the
government
of
the
united
states
from
subversion.
it
was
approved
by
this
court
in
1925
in
an
opinion
which
specifically
excluded
the
concept
of
clear
and
present
danger,
and
that
was
clarified
by
a
dissent
of
homes
and
brandeis.
and
then
that
statute
was
never
invoked
in
the
state
of
new
york
again
until
the
summer
of
1964
when
william
epton
was
indicted
by
a
grand
jury
in
august
by
the
same
white
middle-class
set
up
under
the
same
statutes
that
we
are
challenging
here.
and
then
there's
something
that
has
not
been
argued
in
any
of
the
briefs.
in
fact,
i
really
just
came
across
it.
that
in
1945
after
epton
had
been
indicted
the
legislature
of
the
state
of
new
york
met
and
amended
the
anarchy
law,
left
out
force
with
regard
to
the
overthrow,
simplified
it
a
great
deal,
and
also
said
that
the
anarchy
had
to
only
be
directed
against
the
state
of
new
york,
and
in
the
practice
commentary
of
the
framers
of
the
legislation,
mr.
danzer
and
mr.
mcquillan.
they
say
this
section
substantially
restates
one
phase
of
the
former
penal
laws
principle
criminal
anarchy
provisions.
and
then
it
goes
on
to
say
that
they've
changed
the
law
because
of
pennsylvania
against
nelson.
in
other
words,
the
legislature
decided
that
supersedure
had
taken
place
and
that
the
legislature
had
a
right
to
legislate
about
state
sedition
but
not
about
national
sedition.
and
then
the
little
note
maker
says
concededly
an
offense
of
limited
utility.
alright,
now
this
happened
in
1965
but
this
law
was
only
going
to
be
effective
on
september
1,
1967.
so
we
aren't
really
dealing
with
this
law
except
judge
friendly
did
talk
about
it
in
his
opinion
saying
that
even
if
--
that
we
shouldn't
be
worried
about
this
particular
action
because
these
defendants
were
--
could
be
--
there
was
a
constitutional
statute
now
that
they
could
be
charged
against
--
it
could
be
charged
against
them.
but
i
say
that
it's
quite
unusual
that
you
have
a
--
the
legislature
amending
the
statute
and
then
the
highest
court
of
the
state,
as
it
did
in
epton
in
may
of
1967,
coming
down
with
the
decision
saying
that
the
statute
which
had
been
amended
by
the
legislature
was
constitutional
before
it
was
amended,
even
though
the
legislature
didn't
think
it
was
amended.
and
i
think
that
there
is
again
a
case
of
first
impression
before
this
court
with
regard
to
the
power
of
a
court
to
keep
reinterpreting
legislative
enactments.
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
i
think
it
kindly
--
it
finally
reaches
and
i'm
thinking
of
what
mr.
jackson
said
this
morning
that
perhaps
this
due
process
is
not
wound
up
with
fairness.
but
i
would
think
that
at
a
certain
point
a
legislature
would
not
have
the
--
it
seems
to
be
a
legislature
would
not
have
the
right
to
do
two
things.
or
it
would
not
have
the
right,
constitutionally
because
it
wouldn't
be
due
process
to
read
the
plain
meaning
of
language
out
of
what
the
statute
said.
i
think
that
would
be
due
process.
we
know
in
the
decisions
of
this
court,
winters
being
a
leading
one
and
at
being
very
well
established,
that
the
gloss
that
a
state
legislature
puts
on
a
statute
is
to
be
reexamined
by
this
court
by
standards
of
whether
or
not
the
gloss
is
constitutional.
and
i
think
there
is
another
aspect
of
due
process
--
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
of
the
what?
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
i
certainly
do.
and
i
will
very
briefly
tell
you
why.
the
gloss
that
the
court
put
on
the
epton
statute
misses
in
one
respect
which
is
already
been
mentioned,
and
that
is
that
it
doesn't
give
fair
warning
to
those
persons
before
--
who
committed
acts
before
that
the
court
told
them
what
the
statute
says.
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
and
--
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
alright,
as
to
people
today,
it
seems
to
me
that
it
misses
an
important
aspect
that
this
court
said
dennis
meant
when
it
spoke
in
yates.
it
said
that
the
--
that
one
of
the
aspects
of
the
clear
and
present
danger
of
the
overthrow
of
the
government
or
the
force
and
violence
had
to
involve
a
group
or
a
person
joining
a
group
which
was
of
sufficient
strength
to
actually
accomplish
the
end.
and
that
was
never
mentioned
by
the
court
in
epton.
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
i
don't
know
whether
i
did
it
adequately,
but
i
certainly
am
raising
it
here.
and
then
there
is
another
--
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
i
didn't
argue
it
just
that
way.
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
yes,
i
said
that
this
case
was
distinguished
from
dennis.
i
also
don't
think
--
i
think
there
are
different
principles
applying
to
a
federal
statute
having
to
do
with
overthrow
of
the
government
and
a
state
statute.
and
furthermore,
i
think
that
something
that
mr.
justice
warren
said
very
clearly
in
the
nelson
case,
and
that
was
with
it
the
smith
act
and
the
whole
area
of
the
internal
security
legislation
has
proscribed
the
states
from
legislating
in
that
area.
that
doesn't
mean
they
can't
have
laws
saying
that
people
can't
go
out
and
get
guns
together.
but
they
can't
talk
about
overthrow
of
the
government
of
the
state.
and
actually,
that's
what
the
legislature
of
the
state
of
new
york
thought
to
a
degree,
not
completely
because
they
thought
--
they
didn't
think
it
that
a
person
could
talk
about
overthrow
of
the
government
of
the
united
states.
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
well,
yes,
we're
actually
saying
that
the
supreme
court
or
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
state
of
new
york
can
not
read
all
this
new
language
into
a
statute
it
has
once
interpreted
40
years
ago
in
order
to
make
a
prosecution
hold
against
a
number
of
black
people
who
have
politically
unpopular
ideas.
and
i
want
to
bring
the
court's
attention
to
what
the
district
attorney
said
it
was
necessary
to
charge
the
defendants
here
with
the
crime
of
anarchy
along
with
the
other
42
counts
of
gun
possession
because
the
district
attorney
had
to
show
the
element
of
intent,
and
what
does
he
say
in
the
various
press
releases
which
are
part
of
the
papers
in
this
case?
these
are
--
this
is
what
the
district
attorney
in
this
prosecution
thinks
the
defendants
were
doing
“ram,
which
was
dedicated
to
the
overthrow
of
the
capitalist
system
in
the
united
states
by
violence
if
necessary.”
mackell
said
the
arrested
ram
members
are
followers
of
chinese
premier
mao
tse-tung
and
are
associated
with
another
negro
organization
called
black
americans
unite
or
perish.
their
intent
was
to
spur
negro
militancy
across
the
nation,
police
said,
following
recent
ghetto
rioting
in
atlanta,
tampa,
dayton,
cincinnati,
and
waltz.
i
submit
that
this
statute
here
is
being
used
in
a
way
similar
to
what
a
commentator
once
said
about
the
using
self-incrimination
evidence
that
it's
a
part
of
laziness.
it's
far
easier
to
sit
in
the
shade
and
rub
red
pepper
in
some
poor
devil's
eyes,
than
to
go
out
in
the
sun
collecting
evidence.
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
well,
my
client
was
charged
with
the
first
count
was
disseminating
--
was
talking
about
the
overthrow
of
the
government
of
the
state
of
new
york
with
--
by
force
and
violence.
the
second
count
was
writing
pamphlets
dedicated
towards
the
same
thing
with
the
use
of
guns
--
and
the
use
of
guns.
the
third
count
was
assembly
for
that
purpose.
and
then
the
fourth
count
was
--
is
conspiracy
to
do
that
with
a
number
of
overt
acts
9
out
of
14,
i
believe
having
to
do
with
again
the
dissemination
of
leaflets,
pamphlets,
meetings,
speech.
so
that
in
so
far
as
the
anarchy
aspect
of
the
case
is
concerned,
it
has
to
do
with
the
dissemination
of
ideas
which
are
unpopular
now.
i
do
not
think
that
this
court
can
shut
its
eyes
to
the
fact
that
the
anarchy
statute
has
not
been
used
in
new
york
for
anything
other,
in
the
60's
and
not
before
that
since
not
the
20's,
then
to
try
to
proscribe
the
conduct
of
black
people
in
expressing
ideas
which
are
unpopular.
and
we
are
faced
with
the
situation
where
the
court
is
acting
like
a
super
legislature
going
along
with
the
district
attorney
so
that
it's
more
than
the
punishment
fitting
the
crime,
but
it's
the
courts
in
a
sort
of
after
arranged
approval
of
the
conduct
of
the
prosecution
approving
a
crime
to
fit
the
so-called
bad
conduct.
now,
there
has
been
a
great
deal
of
discussion
in
this
court
about
hard
core
conduct
as
distinguished
from
other
kind
of
conduct
under
the
free
speech
cases.
and
judge
friendly,
in
the
court
below
said
that
these
defendants
don't
have
a
prayer
in
his
court,
because
their
conduct
was
hard
core
conduct.
now,
i
don't
think
you
can
talk
about
hard
core
conduct
where
you
have
a
challenge
to
a
statute
that
is
vague.
and
this
court
held
160
and
160
as
fatally
vague
in
the
keyishian
case.
now,
you
might
have
hard
core
conduct
in
a
situation
where
the
statute
is
overbroad
where
you
say
that
certain
things
are
enumerated
which
are
bad
and
other
things
are
mentioned
which
are
of
--
which
don't
--
which
are
too
vague
or
too
broad
and
should
not
be
upheld.
but
here
there
is
nothing
that
these
defendants
did
with
regard
to
the
anarchy
counts
that
it
seems
to
me
is
not
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
they
were
part
--
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
yes,
yes.
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
yes,
in
fact
it
was
not
--
there
weren't
a
lot
of
you
together
on
that
one.
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
well,
i
don't
know
what
--
i
can't
answer
that
because
i
don't
know
what
you
mean
by
directly.
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
they
came
--
it
was
the
definition
of
sedition
was
framed
by
160
and
161,
and
sedition
was
in
the
education
act.
sedition
was
the
word
used
in
the
education
act.
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
and
--
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
that's
right,
that's
right.
so
that
when
you
read
it,
it
sounds
as
though
this
court
is
squarely
saying
that
the
language
as
a
whole
is
too
vague.
and
therefore,
i
don't
--
i
think
that
the
whole
concept
of
hard
core
cannot
be
thought
of,
because
hard
core
has
to
refer
to
a
situation
where
a
statute
is
partly
constitutional.
it
applies
to
some
kind
of
conduct
that
the
legislature
would
have
a
right
to
proscribe.
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
it
has,
pending
this
decision.
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
well,
i
believe
you
called
it
hard
medicine
or
something
to
that
--
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
--
to
that
effect
in
the
dissent
in
cameron.
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
i
was
quite
impressed
with
the
intention
given
to
it
to
the
issue
by
the
ali,
where
a
number
of
jurist
have
gotten
together
and
they
have
come
up
with
the
use
of
the
injunctive
or
injunctive
remedy
in
a
situation
where
the
first
amendment
is
involved,
and
--
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
i
don't
think
i
have
to
say
i
would
if
any.
i'm
talking
about
this
case,
and
i
think
that
this
case
is
appropriately
a
case
where
the
remedy
should
issue.
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
well,
i
think
that
raises
another
problem
which
was
not
raised
here,
and
that
is
perhaps
a
hearing
to
determine
what
the
facts
are
and
the
court
below
might
--
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
well,
without
answering
your
question,
i
would
say
that
it
differs
from
the
one
here,
because
there
we
are
assuming
that
there
is
a
valid
state
statue
and
that
this
prosecution
that
the
defense
of
the
defendant
is
that
it
was
a
first
amendment
defense.
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
well,
that
is
the
rub
in
this
case.
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
well,
if
it
is
too
broad
as
this
anarchy
statute
and
couldn't
be
applied
at
all,
then
i
think
it
would
be
a
very
appropriate
basis
for
a
remedy.
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
i
don't
--
i
don't
want
to
be
the
author
of
that
position.
it
seems
to
me
that
one
may
narrow
the
issue
down
quite
a
bit.
we
have
some
interesting
other
factors
in
this
case.
we
have
the
highest
court
of
a
state
having
given
a
clearly
erroneous
unconstitutional
in
my
opinion.
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
interpretation
of
the
statute,
it
might
be
that
the
federal
court
would
want
to
abstain
until
the
state
had
an
opportunity
to
take
action.
that
might
be
a
consideration.
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
well
may
i
tell
you
why
i
think
--
why
i
very
personally
would
not
like
to
wait?
this
--
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
well,
i'm
not
sure
that
you
can,
because
there
is
a
precise
reason.
my
client
fred
fernandez
could
very
easily
go
to
trial
tomorrow
as
william
epton
did
on
the
anarchy
charges
and
this
arson
in
the
third
degree.
the
judge
could
what
judge
marko
which
he
did
in
epton,
very
conscious
that
your
--
that
these
nine
gentlemen
were
here,
and
give
a
concurrent
sentence
on
the
arson
charge,
in
this
case
of
one
year,
which
your
honors
would
say
that
since
there
is
a
valid
state
statute
which
supports
the
conviction.
we
will
abstain
even
though
mr.
justice
stewart
thought
it
came
properly
before
you,
you
might
like
to
reconsider
the
validity
of
the
anarchy
statutes
of
the
state
of
new
york.
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
well,
you've
done
it
once
before.
i
don't
--
of
course
that
isn't
necessarily
a
precedent.
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
yes,
and
i
--
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
well,
i've
said
--
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
i've
said
in
the
footnote
that
i
don't
believe
an
injunction
is
necessary
that
if
this
court
were
to
declare
the
anarchy
statute
unconstitutional,
i
can
imagine
--
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
right.
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
well
--
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
no,
i
just
seem
to
me
that
i
should
ask
for
what
i
thought
--
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
--
was
in
order
and
an
injunction
does
present
some
pretty
naughty
problems,
and
your
honors
have
not
yet
faced
that
in
here.
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
that's
--
that's
correct.
i
just
want
to
close
with
--
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
well
i've
had
a
declaratory
judgment
the
wrong
way.
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
the
wrong
way.
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
that's
correct.
it
seems
to
me
that
we've
got
a
sedition
law
just
like
the
ones
we
had
back
in
the
18th
century.
and
james
madison
said
that
they
were
monsters
who
will
--
whose
parents
could
never
get
over
them.
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
mr.
chief
justice,
if
it
please
the
court.
my
client
in
this
case
is
fred
fernandez.
he
is
one
of
the
15
subject
to
the
indictment.
and
i
want
to
commence
my
argument
sort
of
taking
going
on
from
mr.
rabinowitz's
argument,
on
the
theory
that
the
issue
of
2283
and
1983
i
think
can
well
be
answered
as
mr.
rabinowitz
answered
it.
but
i'm
not
sure
that
that's
an
adequate
answer
because
after
one
says,
“yes,
there
is
the
power
to
enjoin.”
it's
obviously
not
a
principle
which
is
promotive
of
peace
in
the
states
to
have
the
federal
courts
interfering
whenever
there
is
a
claim
of
unfairness
below.
and
so
i
have
called
over
some
of
the
opinions
of
this
court
and
some
of
the
writings
of
the
american
law
institute
with
regard
to
their
consideration
of
this
subject
and
it
seems
to
me
that
we
can
set
up
four
reasons
or
four
considerations
which
all
obtained
in
this
case
which
would
persuade
a
court
not
to
abstain
from
a
decision
with
regard
to
a
constitutional
issue.
the
general
premise
being
that
a
federal
court
will
abstain
and
permit
a
state
court
to
decide
the
issues
of
constitutionality
where
they
are
raised.
now,
the
first
consideration
has
to
do
with
the
first
amendment.
and
generally
speaking
this
court
has
been
more
sensitive
to
issues
of
first
amendment
particularly
when
they
arise
in
the
states
and
for
a
number
of
reasons,
in
order
to
create
the
uniformity
of
law
in
the
united
states
and
in
order
to
protect
the
first
amendment
which
sometimes
in
the
heat
of
whatever
--
of
the
battle
below
state
jurisdictions
are
not
as
sensitive
to
the
issues.
now
that
--
i'm
going
to
mention
this
four
factors
and
then
go
back
over
them.
the
second
one
ties
in
to
the
first
amendment
and
it
has
to
do
with
--
when
the
issue
involving
the
first
amendment
has
to
do
with
the
public
business
and
i'm
referring
to
the
language
used
by
mr.
justice
white
when
--
in
the
red
lion
case
when
he
referred
to
the
kind
of
--
the
kind
of
public
business
that
alexander
meiklejohn
talks
about
when
he's
talking
about
the
firstamendment,
talking
about
the
right
of
people,
to
hear
arguments,
and
the
right
of
people
to
speak.
and
when
in
you're
in
the
area
of
sedition,
you
are
in
the
area
of
the
public
business
because
you're
talking
about
government
and
some
people's
ideas
about
what's
wrong
with
it.
then
the
third
factor
has
to
do
with
--
and
it's
a
very
important
question
and
that
is
can
the
constitutional
issue
even
though
it
involves
the
first
amendment,
even
though
it
involves
the
public
business,
can
it
be
solved
by
the
state
route?
is
the
issue
something
that
the
state
court
has
not
yet
had
an
opportunity
to
rule
on?
perhaps
there
is
even
an
independent
state
ground
as
in
the
recent
case
that
had
to
do
with
alaskan
fishing
rights.
your
--
this
court
abstained.
mr.
justice
douglas
wrote
the
opinion.
this
court
abstained
because
there
might
even
have
been
a
decision
there
based
upon
the
alaska
constitution.
so,
that
even
though
they
were
important
issues,
it's
not
appropriate
for
this
court
to
interfere.
then
there's
a
fourth
ground
which
is
that
the
prosecution
itself
is
unfair
and
discriminatory.
and
perhaps
a
law
which
is
not
ordinarily
invoked
against
the
defendant
is
used.
and
that
is
a
fourth
basis.
and
that
fourth
basis
was
mentioned
in
the
al,
the
american
law
institute
series
of
reasons
given
when
they
decide
it.
of
course,
they
are
not
the
supreme
court
but
there
are
number
of
judges
sitting
on
it.
they
decided
that
1983
or
there
is
an
exception
or
there
should
be
an
exception
in
the
law
to
the
absolute
caveat
against
the
federal
court
issuing
an
injunction
against
the
state
court
prosecution.
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
well,
it
hasn't
been
with
regard
to
the
banking
act.
i
believe
that
there
is
a
whole
line
of
opinion
that
shows
that
--
well,
as
to
other
instances
where
it's
not
written
in.
certainly
the
way
1983
is
phrased
which
gives
a
litigant
a
right
to
relief
equitable
or
otherwise
would
suggest
the
--
it
is
an
expressed
exception.
now,
in
all
of
these
considerations,
i
think
we
started
out
with
the
fact
that
we
are
talking
about
equity.
so
if
any
of
these
considerations
do
not
obtain
or
are
not
persuasive,
then
it
is
something
that
should
be
perhaps
sent
back
to
the
state
court.
but
in
--
mr.
justice
marshall
mentioned
removal
as
though
that
might
be
an
adequate
remedy.
may
i
say
that's
a
very
narrow
remedy
and
although
originally
it
may
have
been
intended
to
overlap
1983,
i
think
today
a
litigant
would
have
a
pretty
hard
time
using
it
in
one
of
these
cases.
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
it's
written
that
way.
may
i
say
it's
written
that
way
but
not
interpreted.
now,
with
regard
to
these
consider
--
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
i'm
sorry.
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
they
are
changed
but
i
think
in
some
ways
there
are
challenges
--
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
not
in
queens.
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
oh,
i
wouldn't
say
that,
your
honor.
i
couldn't
say
that.
but
i
don't
think
--
i
don't
want
to
make
this
an
ad
hominem
argument,
i
think
there
are
as
compelling
reasons
today
to
be
interested
in
the
first
amendment
and
into
--
in
the
considerations
of
fairness
and
the
four
considerations
i
mentioned
as
there
were
during
the
civil
war
period.
so,
or
--
and
the
--
and
its
aftermath.
now,
with
regard
to
this
application
to
the
instant
case,
question
was
asked,
was
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
in
epton
the
narrowing
interpretation
--
is
that
narrowing
interpretation
constitutional?
and
i
submit
that
its
not
for
the
reason
that
the
highest
court
of
the
state
of
new
york
in
trying
to
read
in
to
the
--
to
160
and
161
and
presumably
if
that
obtains,
it
would
also
be
read
into
the
new
statute
which
supersedes
160
and
161
which
had
already
been
passed
but
which
was
not
yet
effective
at
the
time
the
highest
court
of
new
york
interpreted
the
statute.
that
highest
court
left
out
of
its
language,
language
which
appears
in
brandenburg,
which
has
to
do
with
the
requirement
for
the
validity
of
a
sedition
statute
that
the
danger
of
overthrow
or
of
lawless
action
be
immanent.
now,
that
has
been
left
out
of
the
interpretation
of
the
epton's
of
--
in
epton
and
is
left
out
of
the
statute
--
the
statute's
interpretation
and
it
also
is
missing
from
the
indictment.
if
you
will
read
the
indictment
in
this
case,
you
will
read
that
there
is
no
--
there
are
no
consideration
of
clear
and
present
danger
in
the
indictment
and
all
you
have
is
the
allegation
that
these
defendants
with
regard
to
the
anarchy
counts
advocated
the
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force
and
violence
with
intent
that
it
take
place
but
not
any
allegation
as
to
the
likelihood
of
it
taking
place
or
any
allegation
and
this
is
another
consideration
which
comes
out
of
yates
and
dennis
and
brandenburg.
that
the
--
brandenburg,
not
so
much,
that
they
--
that
the
group
doing
the
advocacy
of
the
overthrow
of
the
government
be
of
sufficient
size
and
strenth
to
actually
present
such
a
threat.
now,
epton
did
one
more
thing
although
the
court
said
in
epton,
that's
the
court
of
appeals,
that
clear
and
present
danger
has
to
be
read
into
the
statute
when
it
implied
that
doctrine
to
the
--
to
epton.
what
it
really
said
was
that
the
clear
and
present
danger
did
not
have
to
be
clear
in
present
danger
of
the
overthrow
of
the
government
of
the
united
states.
all
it
had
to
be
was
clear
and
present
danger
that
the
riots
then
rocking
harlem
continued.
and
i
submit
that
that's
the
meaning
of
epton
and
looked
at
that
way.
the
state
of
new
york
has
an
unconstitutional
statute
which
it
is
trying
to
apply
to
these
defendants.
now,
when
i
speak
of
the
public
business,
i
think
it's
very
important
that
you
know
how
this
case
fits
into
the
public
business,
the
--
what
the
--
we
do
allege
in
our
complaint
that
this
is
a
harassing
action
against
these
defendants.
and
in
the
harassing
we
mentioned
and
it's
attached
to
the
appelant's
brief
and
also
filed
with
the
court.
we
attach
a
number
of
newspaper
stories,
all
of
which
were
released
by
the
district
attorney
at
the
time
that
these
people
were
indicted
and
it's
very
clear
from
the
language
used
in
these
press
releases
that
the
direction
of
this
--
of
the
action
is
against
the
thoughts
of
these
defendants.
now,
quoting
the
district
attorney
on
page
67
here
in
the
press
releases
that
appeared
in
the
press,
he
said
that
stokely
carmichael,
a
leading
black
power
advocate
had
connections
with
ram,
that's
the
revolutionary
action
movement
which
was
dedicated
to
the
overthrow
of
the
capitalist
system
in
the
u.s.
by
violence
if
necessary.
now,
parenthetically
this
is
supposedly
an
anarchy
or
the
attempt
to
overthrow
the
state
of
new
york
yet
all
of
these
press
releases
have
to
do
with
the
overthrow
of
the
government
of
the
united
states.
again,
i
read,
mackell
said
the
arrested
ram
members
are
followers
of
chinese
premier
mao
tse
tung
and
are
associated
with
another
negro
organization
called
black
americans
unite
or
perish
headed
by
robert
williams.
and
again,
their
intent
was
to
spur
negro
militancy
across
the
nation,
police
said.
following
recent
ghetto
rioting
in
atlanta,
tampa,
dayton,
cincinnati
and
watts,
and
then
finally,
i
think
this
really
caps
the
first
amendment
public
business
aspect
of
my
argument.
in
discussing
the
defendants,
mackell
said
that
fernandez
who
headed
--
that's
my
client
who
headed
a
group
of
approximately
20
youths
between
the
ages
of
fifth
--
16
to
21
may
well
have
tried
to
influence
them
with
revolutionary
action
movement
philosophy
and
finally,
queens'
district
attorney
thomas
j.
mackell
said
that
the
16
arrested
on
bearing
charges
were
members
of
ram,
an
anarchist
group
which
federal
authorities
say
is
pro-communist
china
and
pro-cuba.
that
wasn't
the
final
one,
i
wanted
to
--
sorry,
a
bit
of
accumulativeness
here.
the
police
investigation
into
this
matter
dates
back
two
years,
mackell
declared.
i
have
had
assistant
district
attorney
thomas
demakos
of
jackson
heights
on
the
case
ever
since
we
were
informed
about
it.
he
and
lieutenant
james
murphy
of
my
squad
had
been
working
together
on
it.
demakos
had
to
do
a
tremendous
amount
of
reading
and
had
to
digest
hundreds
of
thousands
of
words
before
we
felt
we
were
ready
to
proceed.
now
this,
i
say,
goes
to
the
heart
of
the
first
amendment.
this
is
an
accusation
against
these
defendants
with
regard
to
the
anarchy
charge
that
is
squarely
--
that
is
squarely
violative
of
first
amendment
considerations.
now,
we
cannot
solve
this
case
by
the
state
rule
because
when
it
gets
up
to
the
state
court
of
appeals,
the
state
court
of
appeals
is
bound
by
its
own
decision.
and
there's
another
problem,
by
the
time
this
case
is
tried
there
are
as
you
have
heard
48
counts
in
this
indictment.
only
five
of
which
involve
my
client.
only
four
of
which
involve
anarchy
and
the
fifth
involves
conspiracy
to
commit
arson
in
the
third
degree.
now,
by
the
time
the
jury
has
heard
all
of
the
--
all
of
the
testimony
with
regard
to
anarchy,
i
predict
that
my
client
will
be
convicted
of
arson
in
the
third
degree.
this
is
of
course
a
distinction
from
dombrowski
where
the
contention
was
made
that
the
char
--
criminal
charges
were
brought
against
the
defendants
with
no
possibility
of
their
being
a
conviction.
in
this
case,
we
say
there
is
a
strong
possibility
of
a
conviction
and
that
the
anarchy
charges
served
to
prejudice
the
case
as
a
trial
before
the
jury.
and
in
fact
it
is
argued
by
the
district
attorney
in
his
brief
that
he
needs
the
anarchy
charges
in
order
to
supply
the
factor
of
intent
as
to
the
illegal
gun
charges
which
he
brings
not
against
my
client
who
is
a
casualty
perhaps
of
the
entire
adventure
but
to
attach
intent
to
the
gun
charges
against
the
other
defendants.
now,
the
other
aspect
of
what
can
happen
is
what
exactly
what
did
happen
in
epton.
in
epton
there
was
a
conspiracy
to
riot
charge
that
was
attached
to
the
anarchy
charges.
and
when
he
was
convicted,
the
judge
gave
him
a
sentence
which
was
concurrent
with
--
and
it
--
which
covered
the
conspiracy
to
riot
charge
and
was
one
year
and
therefore
it
never
appeared
what
part
the
anarchy
charges
which
i
can
assure
you
played
a
great
part
in
the
trial.
it
was
never
clear
nor
was
it
ever
capable
of
being
properly
reviewed.
so
you
have
a
record
where
it
will
be
impossible
in
this
case
for
the
defendants
here,
plaintiffs
in
the
action
in
the
federal
court
to
secure
a
fair
trial
or
absolution
by
the
state
method.
you
have
as
i
have
indicated
a
discriminatory
prosecution
by
a
statute
and
i
do
think
that
it's
important
for
the
court
to
consider
this.
this
is
not
a
robbery
statute,
a
--
that
is
invoked
how
many
times
throughout
the
united
states
today.
this
is
not
a
burglary
statute,
this
is
a
sedition
statute
and
it's
used
in
new
york
--
has
only
been
three
times
at
least
in
our
recorded
history.
it's
been
used
in
gitlow
in
1920
and
it
was
revived
6
--
44
year
late
--
44
years
later
in
epton.
and
it
was
only
upon
the
heels
of
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
in
epton
which
came
down
may
16th,
1967
that
these
indictments
were
brought
in
--
were
brought
against
these
16
or
15
defendants.
so
it's
clearly
the
--
a
discriminatory
prosecution.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
--
if
there
is
--
is
ever
a
case
for
the
kind
of
relief
which
is
available
for
federal
intervention,
this
is
it.
there
is
a
further
argument
that
was
made
and
i
want
to
make
it
because
i
think
it
dramatizes
the
validity
of
the
relief
requested
and
that
has
to
do
with
the
grand
jury
point.
since
this
case
was
argued,
this
court
has
come
down
with
two
decisions
which
suggested
that
the
250
property
limitation
might
well
be
invalid
but
another
--
in
another
decision
you've
said
that
the
subjective
standards
which
we
claim
here
might
be
administered
fairly
so
that
the
statute
on
its
face
would
only
be
a
little
bit
unconstitutional,
when
i
say
a
little
bit,
advisedly.
i
think
that
against
the
standards
that
i
have
just
set
up,
the
strauss
standards,
that
it's
a
challenge
to
a
statute
on
the
basis
of
the
first
amendment,
the
grand
jury
statute
wouldn't
make
that.
that
it's
the
public
business.
i
don't
think
it
would
quite
do
that.
that
it
can't
be
solved
by
the
state
route.
well,
a
year
ago
when
i
was
before
you,
i
told
you
it
couldn't
be
solved
by
the
state
route
be
--
and
i
cited
a
lot
of
cases
in
my
brief
showing
that
the
state
had
not
considered
this
issue.
but
on
the
22nd
of
april
of
this
year,
chestnut
against
the
people
of
the
state
of
new
york
was
argued
in
the
court
of
appeals.
and
these
issues
were
presented
to
the
court
of
appeals
not
as
to
queens
county,
as
to
new
york
county.
but
accordingly
we
can
say
that
as
to
the
grand
jury
issue
that
is
something
which
perhaps
can
be
solved
by
the
state
route.
but
i'm
going
to
make
a
suggestion
here
as
to
that.
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
yes,
yes,
i'm
--
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
undecided,
it
was
only
argued
on
the
22nd
of
april.
of
course
that
case
may
come
here
to
before
we
are
through.
but
i'm
suggesting
that
one
does
not
dismiss
such
a
case
out
of
hand
but
one
can
well
send
it
back
to
the
district
court
with
these
instructions
to
await
the
decision
of
the
new
york
court.
there
is
one
problem
and
that's
another
argument
i
think
in
support
of
not
abstaining
here
and
that
is
the
right
of
a
defendant
in
a
criminal
case
and
a
plaintiff
in
an
action
such
as
this
to
finally
get
some
kind
of
relief
from
the
court.
in
other
words,
these
actions
pending
over
a
long
period
of
time
do
not
result
injustice
to
all.
i
will
reserve
any
time
i
have
for
rebuttal.
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
well,
this
case
may
come
before
your
honors
one
day.
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
he's
out
on
$25,000.00
bail
pending
another
kind
of
relief
which
i
did
not
mention.
there
--
that's
habeas
corpus
in
the
federal
court
and
the
habeas
corpus
action
is
awaiting
the
action
of
the
supreme
--
of
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
state
of
new
york
in
the
chestnut
case
because
that's
the
same
grand
jury
which
indicted
him
and
also
the
action
of
this
court
in
this
case.
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
thank
you.
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
mr.
chief
justice,
if
it
please
the
court.
my
client
in
this
case
is
fred
fernandez.
mr.
rabinowitz
was
speaking
on
behalf
of
10
of
the
defendants,
10
out
of
15
and
i
have
one
of
the
15.
i
say
this
because
the
particular
circumstances
of
my
defendant
and
the
plaintiff
in
this
case,
i
think
point
up
some
of
the
problems
in
this
case.
my
client
is
charged
with
three
counts,
the
first
three
counts
in
a
48-count
indictment
with
anarchy.
the
substantive
charge
of
anarchy
and
it
goes
down
the
statute.
the
first
charge
is
speaking
anarchy.
the
second
charge
is
printing
anarchy.
and
the
third
count
is
assembling
with
anarchist.
the
fourth
count
is
a
sort
of
a
jumble,
it
is
a
lesser
count,
it's
a
conspiracy
count
and
it
includes
over
at
having
to
do
with
each
of
the
first
three.
now
the
last
time
i
was
before
your
honors,
i
outlined
what
i
believe
to
be
the
compelling
reasons
why
this
was
an
appropriate
case
for
federal
intervention.
i
have
never
felt
that
it
was
necessary
to
gain
relief
in
this
case
that
the
court
grant
an
injunction
against
the
state
proceeding.
i
have
always
thought
that
a
declaratory
judgment
would
be
sufficient.
however,
i
naturally
would
not
be
against
your
honor
taking
injunctive
relief
if
your
honors
felt
that
the
situation
merited.
although,
there
are
a
number
of
allegations
in
the
complaint
which
had
to
do
with
the
unfairness
of
the
prosecution,
there
are
--
that
is
appended
to
my
brief.
the
publicity
that
was
issued
which
i
think
has
to
do
with
the
very
unfair
prosecution
and
i
don't
know
whether
your
honors
would
rule
on
that
without
a
hearing
and
i
think
that
would
delay
matters
further.
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
yes.
oh!
i
asked
for
an
injunction
and
perhaps
it
was
timidity
when
i
started
checking
through
the
law
as
to
some
of
the
difficulties
involved
in
getting
an
injunction
that
i
retreated
to
the
declaratory
judgment.
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
i
wouldn't
be
here.
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
right.
no.
i
think
the
minute
--
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
that
is
correct
and
i
believe
that
injunctive
relief
is
appropriate
and
i
believe
that
had
my
allegations
been
listened
to,
i
should
have
had
a
hearing
before
that
three-judge
court
as
to
those
allegations,
as
to
the
unfairness
of
the
proceeding.
and
i
understand
you
can
have
an
injunction
for
a
facially
unconstitutional
statute
but
you
also
can
have
an
injunction
at
least
under
the
language
in
dombrowski
where
the
fact
shows
that
the
prosecution
has
been
unfair.
and
i
say
that
it
is
both
that
in
this
case.
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
no.
no,
i
am
only
saying
that
i
would
be
pleased
with
one
which
is
different
with
the
declaratory
judgment.
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
i
think
that
the
state
court
would
respect
it.
now
if
the
state
court
did
not
respect
that
declaratory
judgment,
i
wouldn't
want
to
be
in
a
position
where
i
couldn't
come
back.
but
i
do
believe
in
the
committee
of
the
relationship
between
federal
and
state
and
i
believe
that
a
state
court
would
respect
that
injunction.
now
coming
back
to
which
--
to
a
point
that
i
believe
is
jugular
and
it
has
to
do
with
the
question
asked
me
by
justice
white
at
the
first
argument
and
i
don't
know
that
i
answered
it
very
well.
that
had
to
do
with
--
in
this
case,
we
have
the
anarchy
statute
of
the
state
of
new
york
passed
as
you
all
know
in
1902,
interpreted
by
the
highest
court
of
the
state
of
new
york
in
1922
that
interpretation
was
affirmed
by
this
court
in
1925,
and
then
nothing
was
done
about
that
statute
until
william
epton
was
charged
with
it
in
1964.
the
legislature
went
back
to
work
on
it
deciding
that
since
it
was
going
to
be
used,
they
ought
to
make
it
constitutional
and
they
tried
to
make
it
fit
pennsylvania
against
nelson.
the
legislature
i
am
talking
about
in
1965.
but
meanwhile,
the
prosecution
of
epton
went
forward
and
the
court
of
appeals
interpreted
the
statute
as
though
the
legislature
had
done
nothing
or
as
though
the
statute
were
written
as
though
as
though
the
legislature
later
rewrote
it.
now
the
question
of
justice
white
was,
was
the
statute
or
is
the
statute
constitutional
with
the
new
gloss
of
the
court
of
appeals?
i
said
that
it
was
not
and
i've
argued
that
in
my
brief
but
i
want
to
read
to
you
what
that
state
court
said
because
i
think
within
this
language,
one
can
see
the
gross
unconstitutionality
of
the
new
interpretation.
you
will
recall
that
the
state
court
said,
“of
course
we
were
wrong
in
1925,
looked
at
in
1967.
so
we
are
going
to
reinterpret
the
statute,”
which
this
court
and
we
interpreted
some
years
ago.
and
we
are
going
to
interpret
it
consistent
with
constitutional
requirements.
what
are
these
constitutional
requirements?
i
am
now
reading
which
must
now
be
read
into
our
criminal
anarchy
statute
to
preserve
its
constitutionality.
it
is
clear
that
proscription
of
mere
advocacy
of
the
violent
overthrow
of
the
government
would
be
an
unconstitutional
infringement
upon
free
speech.
the
advocacy
of
the
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force
and
violence
must
in
accompanied
by
intent
to
accomplish
the
overthrow
and
there
must
be
a
clear
and
present
danger
that
the
advocated
overthrow
may
be
attempted
or
accomplished.
now
that
almost
sounds
constitutional.
but
then,
and
mind
you
were
talking
about
and
this
crucial
to
my
argument.
we
are
talking
about
the
overthrow
of
the
government
of
the
state
of
new
york.
we
are
not
talking
about
the
united
states
government.
so
now
the
court
goes
on
having
made
that
statement,
there
is
no
doubt
this
is
applying
the
law
to
the
facts.
there
is
no
doubt
that
epton
intended
to
inflame
the
already
intense
passions
of
the
troubled
people
of
harlem
and
to
incite
them
to
greater
violence.
furthermore,
defendant's
exhortations
calling
for
organized
resistance
to
the
police
and
the
destruction
of
the
state
in
the
setting
of
harlem
during
the
week
of
july
18th
formed
a
sufficient
basis
for
the
trial
court
and
jury
to
conclude
that
his
words
and
actions
created
a
clear
and
present
danger
that
the
riots
then
rocking
harlem
would
be
intensified
or
if
they
see
subsided
rekindled.
now
i
submit
that
the
gloss
that
the
court
of
appeals
put
on
the
anarchy
statute
was
gloss
on
a
riot
state
and
was
not
on
an
anarchy
statute
and
because
the
evil
that
the
legislature
has
a
right
to
proscribe
would
be
the
overthrow
of
the
government
of
the
state
of
new
york
if
you
follow
their
logic.
now
i
say
that
court
of
appeals
made
this
error
for
a
historical
reason
because
there
can
be
no
illegal
act
of
the
overthrow
of
state
government.
there
can't
be
ever
since
1789
when
the
constitution
was
ratified.
and
i
want
to
go
back
in
the
history
to
remind,
your
honors
of
the
fact
that
there
was
once
a
rebellion
against
the
state
government
before
the
constitution
was
ratified
and
during
the
period
that
the
articles
of
confederation
kept
our
country
together.
and
that
rebellion
was
called
shay's
rebellion
and
it
came
about
when
the
soldiers
came
back
from
the
revolutionary
war
and
they
found
that
creditors
were
making
things
very
difficult,
they
were
in
debt
and
they
did
not
like
it
and
the
next
thing,
there
was
a
rebellion
and
it
was
lead
by
a
man
by
the
name
of
daniel
shay
and
it
was
put
down
by
a
general
benjamin
lincoln
who
had
to
be
paid
for
efforts
from
the
coffers
of
the
state
of
massachusetts
because
there
was
no
federal
government.
and
it
was
shay's
rebellion,
the
last
rebellion
against
the
state
government
that
gave
the
impetus
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
and
so
it
is
that
hamilton
writing
in
1787
in
the
minutes
of
the
proceedings
of
the
constitutional
convention
said,
“how
are
all
these
evils
to
be
avoided?”
and
these
evils
of
course
are
the
evils
of
the
shays'
rebellion.
only
by
a
complete
sovereignty
in
the
general
government,
the
general
power
must
swallow
up
the
state
powers.
otherwise,
it
will
be
swallowed
by
them.
two
sovereignties
--
i
should
have
learned.
two
sovereignties
can
not
co-exist
within
the
same
limit.
now
general
washington
also
had
occasion
to
comment
on
this
problem
and
in
a
letter
written
in
1787,
the
same
year
that
hamilton
was
writing,
he
said,
“you
will
long
ere
this
have
heard
of
the
insurrection
in
the
state
of
massachusetts.”
these
disorders
are
evident
marks
of
defective
government.
indeed,
the
thinking
part
of
the
country,
of
the
people
of
this
country
are
now
so
well
satisfied
of
this
fact
that
most
of
the
legislatures
have
appointed
and
the
rest,
it
is
said
will
appoint
delegates
to
meet
at
philadelphia
on
the
second
monday
in
may
next
in
a
general
convention
of
the
states
to
revise
and
correct
the
defects
of
the
federal
system.
and
then
it
was
thomas
jefferson
who
wrote
in
a
letter
to
madison
the
same
year.
the
late
rebellion
in
massachusetts
has
given
more
alarm
than
i
think
it
should
have
done.
calculate
that
one
rebellion
in
13
states
in
the
course
of
11
years,
is
but
one
for
each
state
in
a
century
and
a
half.
no
country
should
be
so
long
without
one.
nor
will
any
degree
of
power
in
the
hands
of
government
prevent
insurrection.
let
me
add
that
a
bill
of
rights
is
what
the
people
are
entitled
to
against
every
government
on
earth,
general
or
particular
and
what
no
just
government
shall
refuse
or
rest
or
let
rest
on
influence.
now,
why
i
am
reading
these
quotations?
because
of
course
you
can
not
have
the
overthrow
of
a
state
government
and
so
that
whole
law
itself
is
an
absurdity.
there
was
argument
in
the
case
of
pennsylvania
against
nelson
which
we
have
urged
in
out
briefs
with
regard
to
unconstitutionality
of
this
law,
which
underlines
with
the
coming
of
the
smith
act,
the
supersedure
of
the
sedition
field
by
the
federal
government.
but
i
think
a
better
argument
than
the
argument
made
by
this
court
there
is
the
fact
that
you
really
can
not
have
--
the
overthrow
of
a
state
government
because
the
minute
that
government
is
threatened
with
its
overthrow,
it
is
a
matter
of
federal
concern.
now
you
can
have
acts,
you
can
have
acts
proscribed
which
disturb
the
public
peace
which
you
can
proscribe
them
to
be
of
a
greater
degree
if
they
impinge
upon
the
state
house
or
if
--
it
seems
to
me
that
you
can
describe
crimes
in
many
ways,
having
to
do
with
the
imagination
of
the
legislatures
and
of
the
prosecutors
to
meet
the
situation.
but
that
it
is
a
travesty
to
go
back
to
a
law
such
as
the
anarchy
statute
of
1902
and
to
believe
that
by
putting
a
gloss
on
it,
taking
out
the
general
government
and
pretending
that
it
isn't
there
that
you
really
talking
about
the
government
of
the
state
of
new
york,
you
can
make
that
law
constitutional.
now
the
bill
of
rights
aspect
what
jefferson
had
to
say
also
brings
me
back
to
the
first
amendment
and
to
the
importance
of
the
first
amendment
in
the
considerations
in
this
case.
my
client
is
being
charged
with
three
felony
counts
of
anarchy
and
one
misdemeanor
count
of
anarchy
and
one
count
of
ars
--
conspiracy
to
commit
arson
in
the
third
degree
which
in
new
york
is
a
misdemeanor.
now
you
will
hear
from
mr.
ludwig
if,
that
is
if
he
says
what
he
has
said
on
other
occasions
before
you,
why
you
have
asked
him,
“do
you
need
this
anarchy
counts
in
an
indictment
which
has
serious
gun
possession
charges
and
one
arson
count,
conspiracy
to
commit
arson
in
the
third
degree?”
and
he
will
tell
you
as
he
did
in
his
briefs
that
the
anarchy
is
necessary
to
prove
the
illegal
intent
of
the
defendants.
now
following
that
logic
as
to
my
client,
my
client
in
order
to
prove
his
intent
for
one
count
of
conspiracy
in
the
third
degree
to
commit
arson
which
is
a
misdemeanor
is
being
charged
with
three
felony
counts.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
tail
is
wagging
the
dog
or
there
is
something
disproportionate
about
the
state
of
affairs.
i
have
as
i
said
outlined
to
you
before
the
reasons
i
believe
this
is
a
most
compelling
case.
it
involves
the
first
amendment
in
the
sense
of
it
being
the
public
business.
in
the
complaint
against
my
defendant,
he
is
charged
with
disseminating
pamphlets
and
their
titles
are
mentioned
in
the
indictment.
those
titles
are
total
resistance.
this
is
in
writing.
this
is
something
that
has
been
written
called
total
resistance
in
writing,
community
self
defense,
and
the
struggle
for
black
state
power
in
the
united
states.
now,
every
charge
in
anarchy,
except
the
first
one
mentions
specifically
the
fact
that
he
is
supporting
and
disseminating
these
documents.
now
certainly
a
statute
or
a
law
which
would
permit
someone
being
criminally
prosecuted
for
the
dissemination
of
these
pamphlets
is
overbroad,
and
it
goes
to
the
heart
of
his
rights
under
the
first
amendment.
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
yes,
there
are
other
overt
acts
having
to
do
with
suggesting
violent
activities.
well,
let's
see.
act
obtained
and
possessed
in
the
county
of
queens
at
indeterminate
amount
of
gun
powder
for
making
explosive.
he
is
charge
and
as
to
any
kind
of
--
those
are
overt
acts
of
course.
i
do
not
know
whether
my
defendant
--
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
no,
but
i
believe
that
a
law
that
would
proscribe
the
possession
of
dynamite
in
large
quantities
would
be
perfectly
constitutional.
but
a
law
that
includes
in
its
ambit,
the
distribution
of
leaflets
it
seems
to
me
is
not.
and
we
have
a
time
in
the
period
of
our
country
when
dissent
in
raising
its
voice
and
when
people
are
dissatisfied
and
when
the
black
people
are
dissatisfied
and
when
they
are
--
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
but
maybe
the
jury
would
be
affected
in
his
judgment
as
to
what
--
whether
it
might
be
a
fact
issue
on
the
dynamite
and
guns
and
maybe
the
jury
would
be
affected
by
hearing
what
his
thoughts
are
with
regard
to
community
self-defense.
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
well
only
because
my
client
is
being
charged
with
advocating
the
doctrine
of
the
overthrow
of
the
government
of
the
state
of
new
york
and
i
am
saying
that
that
kind
of
a
charge
against
my
client
is
inappropriate
and
is
prejudicial
and
further
more
invades
a
very,
very
basic
right
under
the
first
amendment.
and
that
when
the
things
are
jumbled
up
and
put
together,
it
may
well
be
that
the
prejudice
of
the
anarchy
charge
will
lead
to
a
conviction
on
the
other
charges.
the
other
charge,
its
arson
in
the
third
degree
is
the
only
other
charge
my
client
is
charged
with.
i
think
that
this
case
has
an
overwhelming
compulsion
and
i
urge,
your
honors
to
read
the
four
points
that
i
made
in
a
very
brief,
brief
which
i
have
just
filed
with
the
court
having
to
do
with
the
peculiar
situation
as
to
why
relief
is
requested
here
and
i
also
wish
to
urge
upon
you
that
if
i
can
not
get
all
i
want,
meaning
i
want
in
injunction
as
judge
friendly
paraphrased
a
description
of
the
legislature
in
19
--
the
legislature
passing
the
anarchy
law
in
1902,
i
want
all
i
can
get.
thank
you.
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
thank
you.
i'm
not
sure
i
will
take
all
my
time.
i
do
wish
to
disabuse
the
court
of
a
thought
which
came
across
my
mind
as
i
sat
down
and
that
was
the
--
i
sought
the
enjoining
of
the
entire
prosecution
in
this
case.
it
is
true
that
when
i
commenced,
i
challenged
the
grand
jury
statutes
of
the
state
of
new
york,
which
of
course
were
right
to
prevail
would
have
invalidated
the
entire
prosecution.
setting
up
the
challenge
to
the
grand
jury
statutes
although
we
maintain
they
were
unconstitutional
because
that
challenge
did
not
meet
the
test
of
the
first
amendment.
i
would
prove
that
position
and
i
do
not
feel
that
the
entire
prosecution
should
be
invalidated.
in
fact,
and
i
wish
to
underline
it,
the
only
challenge
in
the
plaintiff
and
appellant
fernandez'
case
is
to
the
anarchy
statutes
of
the
state
of
new
york.
now
this
prosecution
with
regard
to
arson
in
the
third
degree
in
so
far
as
these
pleadings
are
concerned
is
perfectly
appropriate
and
should
proceed.
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
if
it
please
the
court.
my
client
is
one
of
the
15
persons
indicted
in
this
case.
and
he
has
somewhat
of
a
unique
position,
because
although
there
are
48
counts
to
the
indictment,
he
is
charged
with
four
counts
--
three
counts
of
the
substantive
anarchy.
one,
of
the
conspiracy
to
commit
anarchy,
and
one
count
which
by
itself
does
not
seem
very
serious
but
is
conspiracy
to
commit
arson
in
the
third
degree.
now,
this
will
become
significant
in
terms
of
my
argument,
although
it
may
not
be
as
significant
as
to
the
other
appellants
in
this
case.
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
to
commit
arson
in
the
third
degree.
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
to
commit
anarchy,
yes.
there
are
four
--
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
well,
i've
had
such
a
long
association
with
anarchy.
i
finally
decided
that
perhaps
committing
is
the
term
to
be
used.
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
five.
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
five
is
the
--
no,
four
is
the
conspiracy
to
commit
anarchy
and
fifth
one
is
arson.
and
interestingly
enough,
you
will
note
there
are
--
that
the
overt
acts
that
the
--
that
all
through
the
anarchy
counts,
you
find
the
dissemination
of
ideas
by
word,
by
distributing
pamphlets.
you
find
assemblage.
you
find
that
kind
of
thing
all
the
way
through.
but
i
want
to
get
back
to
what
we
claim
--
what
i
claim
in
this
appeal.
this
is
a
two
--
a
double
barreled
attack
not
only
on
the
anarchy
statutes
but
also
on
the
grand
jury
statutes
in
the
state
of
new
york.
and
they
go
together
very
well
here,
because
you
have
black
people,
negroes
accused
of
political
crimes
and
they
are
indicted
by
a
predominantly
white
middle-class
grand
jury
which
is
chosen
by
statutorily
set
of
subjective
standards.
now,
i
want
to
go
back
a
little
bit
to
the
history
with
regard
to
this
anarchy
statute
and
what
happened
to
it.
it
was
passed
as
you
know
in
1902,
and
it
came
to
glory
as
it
were
in
1920
when
in
february
mr.
gitlow
was
convicted
of
anarchy.
even
though
as
you
all
recall,
he
was
a
socialist.
it
went
through
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
in
1922
when
that
court
gave
a
ringing
opinion
saying
that
the
state
had
a
right
to
protect
not
only
itself
but
the
government
of
the
united
states
from
subversion.
it
was
approved
by
this
court
in
1925
in
an
opinion
which
specifically
excluded
the
concept
of
clear
and
present
danger,
and
that
was
clarified
by
a
dissent
of
homes
and
brandeis.
and
then
that
statute
was
never
invoked
in
the
state
of
new
york
again
until
the
summer
of
1964
when
william
epton
was
indicted
by
a
grand
jury
in
august
by
the
same
white
middle-class
set
up
under
the
same
statutes
that
we
are
challenging
here.
and
then
there's
something
that
has
not
been
argued
in
any
of
the
briefs.
in
fact,
i
really
just
came
across
it.
that
in
1945
after
epton
had
been
indicted
the
legislature
of
the
state
of
new
york
met
and
amended
the
anarchy
law,
left
out
force
with
regard
to
the
overthrow,
simplified
it
a
great
deal,
and
also
said
that
the
anarchy
had
to
only
be
directed
against
the
state
of
new
york,
and
in
the
practice
commentary
of
the
framers
of
the
legislation,
mr.
danzer
and
mr.
mcquillan.
they
say
this
section
substantially
restates
one
phase
of
the
former
penal
laws
principle
criminal
anarchy
provisions.
and
then
it
goes
on
to
say
that
they've
changed
the
law
because
of
pennsylvania
against
nelson.
in
other
words,
the
legislature
decided
that
supersedure
had
taken
place
and
that
the
legislature
had
a
right
to
legislate
about
state
sedition
but
not
about
national
sedition.
and
then
the
little
note
maker
says
concededly
an
offense
of
limited
utility.
alright,
now
this
happened
in
1965
but
this
law
was
only
going
to
be
effective
on
september
1,
1967.
so
we
aren't
really
dealing
with
this
law
except
judge
friendly
did
talk
about
it
in
his
opinion
saying
that
even
if
--
that
we
shouldn't
be
worried
about
this
particular
action
because
these
defendants
were
--
could
be
--
there
was
a
constitutional
statute
now
that
they
could
be
charged
against
--
it
could
be
charged
against
them.
but
i
say
that
it's
quite
unusual
that
you
have
a
--
the
legislature
amending
the
statute
and
then
the
highest
court
of
the
state,
as
it
did
in
epton
in
may
of
1967,
coming
down
with
the
decision
saying
that
the
statute
which
had
been
amended
by
the
legislature
was
constitutional
before
it
was
amended,
even
though
the
legislature
didn't
think
it
was
amended.
and
i
think
that
there
is
again
a
case
of
first
impression
before
this
court
with
regard
to
the
power
of
a
court
to
keep
reinterpreting
legislative
enactments.
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
i
think
it
kindly
--
it
finally
reaches
and
i'm
thinking
of
what
mr.
jackson
said
this
morning
that
perhaps
this
due
process
is
not
wound
up
with
fairness.
but
i
would
think
that
at
a
certain
point
a
legislature
would
not
have
the
--
it
seems
to
be
a
legislature
would
not
have
the
right
to
do
two
things.
or
it
would
not
have
the
right,
constitutionally
because
it
wouldn't
be
due
process
to
read
the
plain
meaning
of
language
out
of
what
the
statute
said.
i
think
that
would
be
due
process.
we
know
in
the
decisions
of
this
court,
winters
being
a
leading
one
and
at
being
very
well
established,
that
the
gloss
that
a
state
legislature
puts
on
a
statute
is
to
be
reexamined
by
this
court
by
standards
of
whether
or
not
the
gloss
is
constitutional.
and
i
think
there
is
another
aspect
of
due
process
--
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
of
the
what?
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
i
certainly
do.
and
i
will
very
briefly
tell
you
why.
the
gloss
that
the
court
put
on
the
epton
statute
misses
in
one
respect
which
is
already
been
mentioned,
and
that
is
that
it
doesn't
give
fair
warning
to
those
persons
before
--
who
committed
acts
before
that
the
court
told
them
what
the
statute
says.
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
and
--
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
alright,
as
to
people
today,
it
seems
to
me
that
it
misses
an
important
aspect
that
this
court
said
dennis
meant
when
it
spoke
in
yates.
it
said
that
the
--
that
one
of
the
aspects
of
the
clear
and
present
danger
of
the
overthrow
of
the
government
or
the
force
and
violence
had
to
involve
a
group
or
a
person
joining
a
group
which
was
of
sufficient
strength
to
actually
accomplish
the
end.
and
that
was
never
mentioned
by
the
court
in
epton.
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
i
don't
know
whether
i
did
it
adequately,
but
i
certainly
am
raising
it
here.
and
then
there
is
another
--
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
i
didn't
argue
it
just
that
way.
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
yes,
i
said
that
this
case
was
distinguished
from
dennis.
i
also
don't
think
--
i
think
there
are
different
principles
applying
to
a
federal
statute
having
to
do
with
overthrow
of
the
government
and
a
state
statute.
and
furthermore,
i
think
that
something
that
mr.
justice
warren
said
very
clearly
in
the
nelson
case,
and
that
was
with
it
the
smith
act
and
the
whole
area
of
the
internal
security
legislation
has
proscribed
the
states
from
legislating
in
that
area.
that
doesn't
mean
they
can't
have
laws
saying
that
people
can't
go
out
and
get
guns
together.
but
they
can't
talk
about
overthrow
of
the
government
of
the
state.
and
actually,
that's
what
the
legislature
of
the
state
of
new
york
thought
to
a
degree,
not
completely
because
they
thought
--
they
didn't
think
it
that
a
person
could
talk
about
overthrow
of
the
government
of
the
united
states.
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
well,
yes,
we're
actually
saying
that
the
supreme
court
or
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
state
of
new
york
can
not
read
all
this
new
language
into
a
statute
it
has
once
interpreted
40
years
ago
in
order
to
make
a
prosecution
hold
against
a
number
of
black
people
who
have
politically
unpopular
ideas.
and
i
want
to
bring
the
court's
attention
to
what
the
district
attorney
said
it
was
necessary
to
charge
the
defendants
here
with
the
crime
of
anarchy
along
with
the
other
42
counts
of
gun
possession
because
the
district
attorney
had
to
show
the
element
of
intent,
and
what
does
he
say
in
the
various
press
releases
which
are
part
of
the
papers
in
this
case?
these
are
--
this
is
what
the
district
attorney
in
this
prosecution
thinks
the
defendants
were
doing
“ram,
which
was
dedicated
to
the
overthrow
of
the
capitalist
system
in
the
united
states
by
violence
if
necessary.”
mackell
said
the
arrested
ram
members
are
followers
of
chinese
premier
mao
tse-tung
and
are
associated
with
another
negro
organization
called
black
americans
unite
or
perish.
their
intent
was
to
spur
negro
militancy
across
the
nation,
police
said,
following
recent
ghetto
rioting
in
atlanta,
tampa,
dayton,
cincinnati,
and
waltz.
i
submit
that
this
statute
here
is
being
used
in
a
way
similar
to
what
a
commentator
once
said
about
the
using
self-incrimination
evidence
that
it's
a
part
of
laziness.
it's
far
easier
to
sit
in
the
shade
and
rub
red
pepper
in
some
poor
devil's
eyes,
than
to
go
out
in
the
sun
collecting
evidence.
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
well,
my
client
was
charged
with
the
first
count
was
disseminating
--
was
talking
about
the
overthrow
of
the
government
of
the
state
of
new
york
with
--
by
force
and
violence.
the
second
count
was
writing
pamphlets
dedicated
towards
the
same
thing
with
the
use
of
guns
--
and
the
use
of
guns.
the
third
count
was
assembly
for
that
purpose.
and
then
the
fourth
count
was
--
is
conspiracy
to
do
that
with
a
number
of
overt
acts
9
out
of
14,
i
believe
having
to
do
with
again
the
dissemination
of
leaflets,
pamphlets,
meetings,
speech.
so
that
in
so
far
as
the
anarchy
aspect
of
the
case
is
concerned,
it
has
to
do
with
the
dissemination
of
ideas
which
are
unpopular
now.
i
do
not
think
that
this
court
can
shut
its
eyes
to
the
fact
that
the
anarchy
statute
has
not
been
used
in
new
york
for
anything
other,
in
the
60's
and
not
before
that
since
not
the
20's,
then
to
try
to
proscribe
the
conduct
of
black
people
in
expressing
ideas
which
are
unpopular.
and
we
are
faced
with
the
situation
where
the
court
is
acting
like
a
super
legislature
going
along
with
the
district
attorney
so
that
it's
more
than
the
punishment
fitting
the
crime,
but
it's
the
courts
in
a
sort
of
after
arranged
approval
of
the
conduct
of
the
prosecution
approving
a
crime
to
fit
the
so-called
bad
conduct.
now,
there
has
been
a
great
deal
of
discussion
in
this
court
about
hard
core
conduct
as
distinguished
from
other
kind
of
conduct
under
the
free
speech
cases.
and
judge
friendly,
in
the
court
below
said
that
these
defendants
don't
have
a
prayer
in
his
court,
because
their
conduct
was
hard
core
conduct.
now,
i
don't
think
you
can
talk
about
hard
core
conduct
where
you
have
a
challenge
to
a
statute
that
is
vague.
and
this
court
held
160
and
160
as
fatally
vague
in
the
keyishian
case.
now,
you
might
have
hard
core
conduct
in
a
situation
where
the
statute
is
overbroad
where
you
say
that
certain
things
are
enumerated
which
are
bad
and
other
things
are
mentioned
which
are
of
--
which
don't
--
which
are
too
vague
or
too
broad
and
should
not
be
upheld.
but
here
there
is
nothing
that
these
defendants
did
with
regard
to
the
anarchy
counts
that
it
seems
to
me
is
not
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
they
were
part
--
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
yes,
yes.
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
yes,
in
fact
it
was
not
--
there
weren't
a
lot
of
you
together
on
that
one.
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
well,
i
don't
know
what
--
i
can't
answer
that
because
i
don't
know
what
you
mean
by
directly.
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
they
came
--
it
was
the
definition
of
sedition
was
framed
by
160
and
161,
and
sedition
was
in
the
education
act.
sedition
was
the
word
used
in
the
education
act.
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
and
--
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
that's
right,
that's
right.
so
that
when
you
read
it,
it
sounds
as
though
this
court
is
squarely
saying
that
the
language
as
a
whole
is
too
vague.
and
therefore,
i
don't
--
i
think
that
the
whole
concept
of
hard
core
cannot
be
thought
of,
because
hard
core
has
to
refer
to
a
situation
where
a
statute
is
partly
constitutional.
it
applies
to
some
kind
of
conduct
that
the
legislature
would
have
a
right
to
proscribe.
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
it
has,
pending
this
decision.
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
well,
i
believe
you
called
it
hard
medicine
or
something
to
that
--
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
--
to
that
effect
in
the
dissent
in
cameron.
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
i
was
quite
impressed
with
the
intention
given
to
it
to
the
issue
by
the
ali,
where
a
number
of
jurist
have
gotten
together
and
they
have
come
up
with
the
use
of
the
injunctive
or
injunctive
remedy
in
a
situation
where
the
first
amendment
is
involved,
and
--
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
i
don't
think
i
have
to
say
i
would
if
any.
i'm
talking
about
this
case,
and
i
think
that
this
case
is
appropriately
a
case
where
the
remedy
should
issue.
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
well,
i
think
that
raises
another
problem
which
was
not
raised
here,
and
that
is
perhaps
a
hearing
to
determine
what
the
facts
are
and
the
court
below
might
--
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
well,
without
answering
your
question,
i
would
say
that
it
differs
from
the
one
here,
because
there
we
are
assuming
that
there
is
a
valid
state
statue
and
that
this
prosecution
that
the
defense
of
the
defendant
is
that
it
was
a
first
amendment
defense.
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
well,
that
is
the
rub
in
this
case.
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
well,
if
it
is
too
broad
as
this
anarchy
statute
and
couldn't
be
applied
at
all,
then
i
think
it
would
be
a
very
appropriate
basis
for
a
remedy.
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
i
don't
--
i
don't
want
to
be
the
author
of
that
position.
it
seems
to
me
that
one
may
narrow
the
issue
down
quite
a
bit.
we
have
some
interesting
other
factors
in
this
case.
we
have
the
highest
court
of
a
state
having
given
a
clearly
erroneous
unconstitutional
in
my
opinion.
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
interpretation
of
the
statute,
it
might
be
that
the
federal
court
would
want
to
abstain
until
the
state
had
an
opportunity
to
take
action.
that
might
be
a
consideration.
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
well
may
i
tell
you
why
i
think
--
why
i
very
personally
would
not
like
to
wait?
this
--
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
well,
i'm
not
sure
that
you
can,
because
there
is
a
precise
reason.
my
client
fred
fernandez
could
very
easily
go
to
trial
tomorrow
as
william
epton
did
on
the
anarchy
charges
and
this
arson
in
the
third
degree.
the
judge
could
what
judge
marko
which
he
did
in
epton,
very
conscious
that
your
--
that
these
nine
gentlemen
were
here,
and
give
a
concurrent
sentence
on
the
arson
charge,
in
this
case
of
one
year,
which
your
honors
would
say
that
since
there
is
a
valid
state
statute
which
supports
the
conviction.
we
will
abstain
even
though
mr.
justice
stewart
thought
it
came
properly
before
you,
you
might
like
to
reconsider
the
validity
of
the
anarchy
statutes
of
the
state
of
new
york.
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
well,
you've
done
it
once
before.
i
don't
--
of
course
that
isn't
necessarily
a
precedent.
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
yes,
and
i
--
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
well,
i've
said
--
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
i've
said
in
the
footnote
that
i
don't
believe
an
injunction
is
necessary
that
if
this
court
were
to
declare
the
anarchy
statute
unconstitutional,
i
can
imagine
--
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
right.
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
well
--
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
no,
i
just
seem
to
me
that
i
should
ask
for
what
i
thought
--
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
--
was
in
order
and
an
injunction
does
present
some
pretty
naughty
problems,
and
your
honors
have
not
yet
faced
that
in
here.
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
that's
--
that's
correct.
i
just
want
to
close
with
--
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
well
i've
had
a
declaratory
judgment
the
wrong
way.
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
the
wrong
way.
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
that's
correct.
it
seems
to
me
that
we've
got
a
sedition
law
just
like
the
ones
we
had
back
in
the
18th
century.
and
james
madison
said
that
they
were
monsters
who
will
--
whose
parents
could
never
get
over
them.
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
mr.
chief
justice,
if
it
please
the
court.
my
client
in
this
case
is
fred
fernandez.
he
is
one
of
the
15
subject
to
the
indictment.
and
i
want
to
commence
my
argument
sort
of
taking
going
on
from
mr.
rabinowitz's
argument,
on
the
theory
that
the
issue
of
2283
and
1983
i
think
can
well
be
answered
as
mr.
rabinowitz
answered
it.
but
i'm
not
sure
that
that's
an
adequate
answer
because
after
one
says,
“yes,
there
is
the
power
to
enjoin.”
it's
obviously
not
a
principle
which
is
promotive
of
peace
in
the
states
to
have
the
federal
courts
interfering
whenever
there
is
a
claim
of
unfairness
below.
and
so
i
have
called
over
some
of
the
opinions
of
this
court
and
some
of
the
writings
of
the
american
law
institute
with
regard
to
their
consideration
of
this
subject
and
it
seems
to
me
that
we
can
set
up
four
reasons
or
four
considerations
which
all
obtained
in
this
case
which
would
persuade
a
court
not
to
abstain
from
a
decision
with
regard
to
a
constitutional
issue.
the
general
premise
being
that
a
federal
court
will
abstain
and
permit
a
state
court
to
decide
the
issues
of
constitutionality
where
they
are
raised.
now,
the
first
consideration
has
to
do
with
the
first
amendment.
and
generally
speaking
this
court
has
been
more
sensitive
to
issues
of
first
amendment
particularly
when
they
arise
in
the
states
and
for
a
number
of
reasons,
in
order
to
create
the
uniformity
of
law
in
the
united
states
and
in
order
to
protect
the
first
amendment
which
sometimes
in
the
heat
of
whatever
--
of
the
battle
below
state
jurisdictions
are
not
as
sensitive
to
the
issues.
now
that
--
i'm
going
to
mention
this
four
factors
and
then
go
back
over
them.
the
second
one
ties
in
to
the
first
amendment
and
it
has
to
do
with
--
when
the
issue
involving
the
first
amendment
has
to
do
with
the
public
business
and
i'm
referring
to
the
language
used
by
mr.
justice
white
when
--
in
the
red
lion
case
when
he
referred
to
the
kind
of
--
the
kind
of
public
business
that
alexander
meiklejohn
talks
about
when
he's
talking
about
the
firstamendment,
talking
about
the
right
of
people,
to
hear
arguments,
and
the
right
of
people
to
speak.
and
when
in
you're
in
the
area
of
sedition,
you
are
in
the
area
of
the
public
business
because
you're
talking
about
government
and
some
people's
ideas
about
what's
wrong
with
it.
then
the
third
factor
has
to
do
with
--
and
it's
a
very
important
question
and
that
is
can
the
constitutional
issue
even
though
it
involves
the
first
amendment,
even
though
it
involves
the
public
business,
can
it
be
solved
by
the
state
route?
is
the
issue
something
that
the
state
court
has
not
yet
had
an
opportunity
to
rule
on?
perhaps
there
is
even
an
independent
state
ground
as
in
the
recent
case
that
had
to
do
with
alaskan
fishing
rights.
your
--
this
court
abstained.
mr.
justice
douglas
wrote
the
opinion.
this
court
abstained
because
there
might
even
have
been
a
decision
there
based
upon
the
alaska
constitution.
so,
that
even
though
they
were
important
issues,
it's
not
appropriate
for
this
court
to
interfere.
then
there's
a
fourth
ground
which
is
that
the
prosecution
itself
is
unfair
and
discriminatory.
and
perhaps
a
law
which
is
not
ordinarily
invoked
against
the
defendant
is
used.
and
that
is
a
fourth
basis.
and
that
fourth
basis
was
mentioned
in
the
al,
the
american
law
institute
series
of
reasons
given
when
they
decide
it.
of
course,
they
are
not
the
supreme
court
but
there
are
number
of
judges
sitting
on
it.
they
decided
that
1983
or
there
is
an
exception
or
there
should
be
an
exception
in
the
law
to
the
absolute
caveat
against
the
federal
court
issuing
an
injunction
against
the
state
court
prosecution.
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
well,
it
hasn't
been
with
regard
to
the
banking
act.
i
believe
that
there
is
a
whole
line
of
opinion
that
shows
that
--
well,
as
to
other
instances
where
it's
not
written
in.
certainly
the
way
1983
is
phrased
which
gives
a
litigant
a
right
to
relief
equitable
or
otherwise
would
suggest
the
--
it
is
an
expressed
exception.
now,
in
all
of
these
considerations,
i
think
we
started
out
with
the
fact
that
we
are
talking
about
equity.
so
if
any
of
these
considerations
do
not
obtain
or
are
not
persuasive,
then
it
is
something
that
should
be
perhaps
sent
back
to
the
state
court.
but
in
--
mr.
justice
marshall
mentioned
removal
as
though
that
might
be
an
adequate
remedy.
may
i
say
that's
a
very
narrow
remedy
and
although
originally
it
may
have
been
intended
to
overlap
1983,
i
think
today
a
litigant
would
have
a
pretty
hard
time
using
it
in
one
of
these
cases.
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
it's
written
that
way.
may
i
say
it's
written
that
way
but
not
interpreted.
now,
with
regard
to
these
consider
--
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
i'm
sorry.
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
they
are
changed
but
i
think
in
some
ways
there
are
challenges
--
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
not
in
queens.
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
oh,
i
wouldn't
say
that,
your
honor.
i
couldn't
say
that.
but
i
don't
think
--
i
don't
want
to
make
this
an
ad
hominem
argument,
i
think
there
are
as
compelling
reasons
today
to
be
interested
in
the
first
amendment
and
into
--
in
the
considerations
of
fairness
and
the
four
considerations
i
mentioned
as
there
were
during
the
civil
war
period.
so,
or
--
and
the
--
and
its
aftermath.
now,
with
regard
to
this
application
to
the
instant
case,
question
was
asked,
was
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
in
epton
the
narrowing
interpretation
--
is
that
narrowing
interpretation
constitutional?
and
i
submit
that
its
not
for
the
reason
that
the
highest
court
of
the
state
of
new
york
in
trying
to
read
in
to
the
--
to
160
and
161
and
presumably
if
that
obtains,
it
would
also
be
read
into
the
new
statute
which
supersedes
160
and
161
which
had
already
been
passed
but
which
was
not
yet
effective
at
the
time
the
highest
court
of
new
york
interpreted
the
statute.
that
highest
court
left
out
of
its
language,
language
which
appears
in
brandenburg,
which
has
to
do
with
the
requirement
for
the
validity
of
a
sedition
statute
that
the
danger
of
overthrow
or
of
lawless
action
be
immanent.
now,
that
has
been
left
out
of
the
interpretation
of
the
epton's
of
--
in
epton
and
is
left
out
of
the
statute
--
the
statute's
interpretation
and
it
also
is
missing
from
the
indictment.
if
you
will
read
the
indictment
in
this
case,
you
will
read
that
there
is
no
--
there
are
no
consideration
of
clear
and
present
danger
in
the
indictment
and
all
you
have
is
the
allegation
that
these
defendants
with
regard
to
the
anarchy
counts
advocated
the
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force
and
violence
with
intent
that
it
take
place
but
not
any
allegation
as
to
the
likelihood
of
it
taking
place
or
any
allegation
and
this
is
another
consideration
which
comes
out
of
yates
and
dennis
and
brandenburg.
that
the
--
brandenburg,
not
so
much,
that
they
--
that
the
group
doing
the
advocacy
of
the
overthrow
of
the
government
be
of
sufficient
size
and
strenth
to
actually
present
such
a
threat.
now,
epton
did
one
more
thing
although
the
court
said
in
epton,
that's
the
court
of
appeals,
that
clear
and
present
danger
has
to
be
read
into
the
statute
when
it
implied
that
doctrine
to
the
--
to
epton.
what
it
really
said
was
that
the
clear
and
present
danger
did
not
have
to
be
clear
in
present
danger
of
the
overthrow
of
the
government
of
the
united
states.
all
it
had
to
be
was
clear
and
present
danger
that
the
riots
then
rocking
harlem
continued.
and
i
submit
that
that's
the
meaning
of
epton
and
looked
at
that
way.
the
state
of
new
york
has
an
unconstitutional
statute
which
it
is
trying
to
apply
to
these
defendants.
now,
when
i
speak
of
the
public
business,
i
think
it's
very
important
that
you
know
how
this
case
fits
into
the
public
business,
the
--
what
the
--
we
do
allege
in
our
complaint
that
this
is
a
harassing
action
against
these
defendants.
and
in
the
harassing
we
mentioned
and
it's
attached
to
the
appelant's
brief
and
also
filed
with
the
court.
we
attach
a
number
of
newspaper
stories,
all
of
which
were
released
by
the
district
attorney
at
the
time
that
these
people
were
indicted
and
it's
very
clear
from
the
language
used
in
these
press
releases
that
the
direction
of
this
--
of
the
action
is
against
the
thoughts
of
these
defendants.
now,
quoting
the
district
attorney
on
page
67
here
in
the
press
releases
that
appeared
in
the
press,
he
said
that
stokely
carmichael,
a
leading
black
power
advocate
had
connections
with
ram,
that's
the
revolutionary
action
movement
which
was
dedicated
to
the
overthrow
of
the
capitalist
system
in
the
u.s.
by
violence
if
necessary.
now,
parenthetically
this
is
supposedly
an
anarchy
or
the
attempt
to
overthrow
the
state
of
new
york
yet
all
of
these
press
releases
have
to
do
with
the
overthrow
of
the
government
of
the
united
states.
again,
i
read,
mackell
said
the
arrested
ram
members
are
followers
of
chinese
premier
mao
tse
tung
and
are
associated
with
another
negro
organization
called
black
americans
unite
or
perish
headed
by
robert
williams.
and
again,
their
intent
was
to
spur
negro
militancy
across
the
nation,
police
said.
following
recent
ghetto
rioting
in
atlanta,
tampa,
dayton,
cincinnati
and
watts,
and
then
finally,
i
think
this
really
caps
the
first
amendment
public
business
aspect
of
my
argument.
in
discussing
the
defendants,
mackell
said
that
fernandez
who
headed
--
that's
my
client
who
headed
a
group
of
approximately
20
youths
between
the
ages
of
fifth
--
16
to
21
may
well
have
tried
to
influence
them
with
revolutionary
action
movement
philosophy
and
finally,
queens'
district
attorney
thomas
j.
mackell
said
that
the
16
arrested
on
bearing
charges
were
members
of
ram,
an
anarchist
group
which
federal
authorities
say
is
pro-communist
china
and
pro-cuba.
that
wasn't
the
final
one,
i
wanted
to
--
sorry,
a
bit
of
accumulativeness
here.
the
police
investigation
into
this
matter
dates
back
two
years,
mackell
declared.
i
have
had
assistant
district
attorney
thomas
demakos
of
jackson
heights
on
the
case
ever
since
we
were
informed
about
it.
he
and
lieutenant
james
murphy
of
my
squad
had
been
working
together
on
it.
demakos
had
to
do
a
tremendous
amount
of
reading
and
had
to
digest
hundreds
of
thousands
of
words
before
we
felt
we
were
ready
to
proceed.
now
this,
i
say,
goes
to
the
heart
of
the
first
amendment.
this
is
an
accusation
against
these
defendants
with
regard
to
the
anarchy
charge
that
is
squarely
--
that
is
squarely
violative
of
first
amendment
considerations.
now,
we
cannot
solve
this
case
by
the
state
rule
because
when
it
gets
up
to
the
state
court
of
appeals,
the
state
court
of
appeals
is
bound
by
its
own
decision.
and
there's
another
problem,
by
the
time
this
case
is
tried
there
are
as
you
have
heard
48
counts
in
this
indictment.
only
five
of
which
involve
my
client.
only
four
of
which
involve
anarchy
and
the
fifth
involves
conspiracy
to
commit
arson
in
the
third
degree.
now,
by
the
time
the
jury
has
heard
all
of
the
--
all
of
the
testimony
with
regard
to
anarchy,
i
predict
that
my
client
will
be
convicted
of
arson
in
the
third
degree.
this
is
of
course
a
distinction
from
dombrowski
where
the
contention
was
made
that
the
char
--
criminal
charges
were
brought
against
the
defendants
with
no
possibility
of
their
being
a
conviction.
in
this
case,
we
say
there
is
a
strong
possibility
of
a
conviction
and
that
the
anarchy
charges
served
to
prejudice
the
case
as
a
trial
before
the
jury.
and
in
fact
it
is
argued
by
the
district
attorney
in
his
brief
that
he
needs
the
anarchy
charges
in
order
to
supply
the
factor
of
intent
as
to
the
illegal
gun
charges
which
he
brings
not
against
my
client
who
is
a
casualty
perhaps
of
the
entire
adventure
but
to
attach
intent
to
the
gun
charges
against
the
other
defendants.
now,
the
other
aspect
of
what
can
happen
is
what
exactly
what
did
happen
in
epton.
in
epton
there
was
a
conspiracy
to
riot
charge
that
was
attached
to
the
anarchy
charges.
and
when
he
was
convicted,
the
judge
gave
him
a
sentence
which
was
concurrent
with
--
and
it
--
which
covered
the
conspiracy
to
riot
charge
and
was
one
year
and
therefore
it
never
appeared
what
part
the
anarchy
charges
which
i
can
assure
you
played
a
great
part
in
the
trial.
it
was
never
clear
nor
was
it
ever
capable
of
being
properly
reviewed.
so
you
have
a
record
where
it
will
be
impossible
in
this
case
for
the
defendants
here,
plaintiffs
in
the
action
in
the
federal
court
to
secure
a
fair
trial
or
absolution
by
the
state
method.
you
have
as
i
have
indicated
a
discriminatory
prosecution
by
a
statute
and
i
do
think
that
it's
important
for
the
court
to
consider
this.
this
is
not
a
robbery
statute,
a
--
that
is
invoked
how
many
times
throughout
the
united
states
today.
this
is
not
a
burglary
statute,
this
is
a
sedition
statute
and
it's
used
in
new
york
--
has
only
been
three
times
at
least
in
our
recorded
history.
it's
been
used
in
gitlow
in
1920
and
it
was
revived
6
--
44
year
late
--
44
years
later
in
epton.
and
it
was
only
upon
the
heels
of
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
in
epton
which
came
down
may
16th,
1967
that
these
indictments
were
brought
in
--
were
brought
against
these
16
or
15
defendants.
so
it's
clearly
the
--
a
discriminatory
prosecution.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
--
if
there
is
--
is
ever
a
case
for
the
kind
of
relief
which
is
available
for
federal
intervention,
this
is
it.
there
is
a
further
argument
that
was
made
and
i
want
to
make
it
because
i
think
it
dramatizes
the
validity
of
the
relief
requested
and
that
has
to
do
with
the
grand
jury
point.
since
this
case
was
argued,
this
court
has
come
down
with
two
decisions
which
suggested
that
the
250
property
limitation
might
well
be
invalid
but
another
--
in
another
decision
you've
said
that
the
subjective
standards
which
we
claim
here
might
be
administered
fairly
so
that
the
statute
on
its
face
would
only
be
a
little
bit
unconstitutional,
when
i
say
a
little
bit,
advisedly.
i
think
that
against
the
standards
that
i
have
just
set
up,
the
strauss
standards,
that
it's
a
challenge
to
a
statute
on
the
basis
of
the
first
amendment,
the
grand
jury
statute
wouldn't
make
that.
that
it's
the
public
business.
i
don't
think
it
would
quite
do
that.
that
it
can't
be
solved
by
the
state
route.
well,
a
year
ago
when
i
was
before
you,
i
told
you
it
couldn't
be
solved
by
the
state
route
be
--
and
i
cited
a
lot
of
cases
in
my
brief
showing
that
the
state
had
not
considered
this
issue.
but
on
the
22nd
of
april
of
this
year,
chestnut
against
the
people
of
the
state
of
new
york
was
argued
in
the
court
of
appeals.
and
these
issues
were
presented
to
the
court
of
appeals
not
as
to
queens
county,
as
to
new
york
county.
but
accordingly
we
can
say
that
as
to
the
grand
jury
issue
that
is
something
which
perhaps
can
be
solved
by
the
state
route.
but
i'm
going
to
make
a
suggestion
here
as
to
that.
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
yes,
yes,
i'm
--
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
undecided,
it
was
only
argued
on
the
22nd
of
april.
of
course
that
case
may
come
here
to
before
we
are
through.
but
i'm
suggesting
that
one
does
not
dismiss
such
a
case
out
of
hand
but
one
can
well
send
it
back
to
the
district
court
with
these
instructions
to
await
the
decision
of
the
new
york
court.
there
is
one
problem
and
that's
another
argument
i
think
in
support
of
not
abstaining
here
and
that
is
the
right
of
a
defendant
in
a
criminal
case
and
a
plaintiff
in
an
action
such
as
this
to
finally
get
some
kind
of
relief
from
the
court.
in
other
words,
these
actions
pending
over
a
long
period
of
time
do
not
result
injustice
to
all.
i
will
reserve
any
time
i
have
for
rebuttal.
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
well,
this
case
may
come
before
your
honors
one
day.
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
he's
out
on
$25,000.00
bail
pending
another
kind
of
relief
which
i
did
not
mention.
there
--
that's
habeas
corpus
in
the
federal
court
and
the
habeas
corpus
action
is
awaiting
the
action
of
the
supreme
--
of
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
state
of
new
york
in
the
chestnut
case
because
that's
the
same
grand
jury
which
indicted
him
and
also
the
action
of
this
court
in
this
case.
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
thank
you.
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
mr.
chief
justice,
if
it
please
the
court.
my
client
in
this
case
is
fred
fernandez.
mr.
rabinowitz
was
speaking
on
behalf
of
10
of
the
defendants,
10
out
of
15
and
i
have
one
of
the
15.
i
say
this
because
the
particular
circumstances
of
my
defendant
and
the
plaintiff
in
this
case,
i
think
point
up
some
of
the
problems
in
this
case.
my
client
is
charged
with
three
counts,
the
first
three
counts
in
a
48-count
indictment
with
anarchy.
the
substantive
charge
of
anarchy
and
it
goes
down
the
statute.
the
first
charge
is
speaking
anarchy.
the
second
charge
is
printing
anarchy.
and
the
third
count
is
assembling
with
anarchist.
the
fourth
count
is
a
sort
of
a
jumble,
it
is
a
lesser
count,
it's
a
conspiracy
count
and
it
includes
over
at
having
to
do
with
each
of
the
first
three.
now
the
last
time
i
was
before
your
honors,
i
outlined
what
i
believe
to
be
the
compelling
reasons
why
this
was
an
appropriate
case
for
federal
intervention.
i
have
never
felt
that
it
was
necessary
to
gain
relief
in
this
case
that
the
court
grant
an
injunction
against
the
state
proceeding.
i
have
always
thought
that
a
declaratory
judgment
would
be
sufficient.
however,
i
naturally
would
not
be
against
your
honor
taking
injunctive
relief
if
your
honors
felt
that
the
situation
merited.
although,
there
are
a
number
of
allegations
in
the
complaint
which
had
to
do
with
the
unfairness
of
the
prosecution,
there
are
--
that
is
appended
to
my
brief.
the
publicity
that
was
issued
which
i
think
has
to
do
with
the
very
unfair
prosecution
and
i
don't
know
whether
your
honors
would
rule
on
that
without
a
hearing
and
i
think
that
would
delay
matters
further.
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
yes.
oh!
i
asked
for
an
injunction
and
perhaps
it
was
timidity
when
i
started
checking
through
the
law
as
to
some
of
the
difficulties
involved
in
getting
an
injunction
that
i
retreated
to
the
declaratory
judgment.
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
i
wouldn't
be
here.
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
right.
no.
i
think
the
minute
--
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
that
is
correct
and
i
believe
that
injunctive
relief
is
appropriate
and
i
believe
that
had
my
allegations
been
listened
to,
i
should
have
had
a
hearing
before
that
three-judge
court
as
to
those
allegations,
as
to
the
unfairness
of
the
proceeding.
and
i
understand
you
can
have
an
injunction
for
a
facially
unconstitutional
statute
but
you
also
can
have
an
injunction
at
least
under
the
language
in
dombrowski
where
the
fact
shows
that
the
prosecution
has
been
unfair.
and
i
say
that
it
is
both
that
in
this
case.
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
no.
no,
i
am
only
saying
that
i
would
be
pleased
with
one
which
is
different
with
the
declaratory
judgment.
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
i
think
that
the
state
court
would
respect
it.
now
if
the
state
court
did
not
respect
that
declaratory
judgment,
i
wouldn't
want
to
be
in
a
position
where
i
couldn't
come
back.
but
i
do
believe
in
the
committee
of
the
relationship
between
federal
and
state
and
i
believe
that
a
state
court
would
respect
that
injunction.
now
coming
back
to
which
--
to
a
point
that
i
believe
is
jugular
and
it
has
to
do
with
the
question
asked
me
by
justice
white
at
the
first
argument
and
i
don't
know
that
i
answered
it
very
well.
that
had
to
do
with
--
in
this
case,
we
have
the
anarchy
statute
of
the
state
of
new
york
passed
as
you
all
know
in
1902,
interpreted
by
the
highest
court
of
the
state
of
new
york
in
1922
that
interpretation
was
affirmed
by
this
court
in
1925,
and
then
nothing
was
done
about
that
statute
until
william
epton
was
charged
with
it
in
1964.
the
legislature
went
back
to
work
on
it
deciding
that
since
it
was
going
to
be
used,
they
ought
to
make
it
constitutional
and
they
tried
to
make
it
fit
pennsylvania
against
nelson.
the
legislature
i
am
talking
about
in
1965.
but
meanwhile,
the
prosecution
of
epton
went
forward
and
the
court
of
appeals
interpreted
the
statute
as
though
the
legislature
had
done
nothing
or
as
though
the
statute
were
written
as
though
as
though
the
legislature
later
rewrote
it.
now
the
question
of
justice
white
was,
was
the
statute
or
is
the
statute
constitutional
with
the
new
gloss
of
the
court
of
appeals?
i
said
that
it
was
not
and
i've
argued
that
in
my
brief
but
i
want
to
read
to
you
what
that
state
court
said
because
i
think
within
this
language,
one
can
see
the
gross
unconstitutionality
of
the
new
interpretation.
you
will
recall
that
the
state
court
said,
“of
course
we
were
wrong
in
1925,
looked
at
in
1967.
so
we
are
going
to
reinterpret
the
statute,”
which
this
court
and
we
interpreted
some
years
ago.
and
we
are
going
to
interpret
it
consistent
with
constitutional
requirements.
what
are
these
constitutional
requirements?
i
am
now
reading
which
must
now
be
read
into
our
criminal
anarchy
statute
to
preserve
its
constitutionality.
it
is
clear
that
proscription
of
mere
advocacy
of
the
violent
overthrow
of
the
government
would
be
an
unconstitutional
infringement
upon
free
speech.
the
advocacy
of
the
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force
and
violence
must
in
accompanied
by
intent
to
accomplish
the
overthrow
and
there
must
be
a
clear
and
present
danger
that
the
advocated
overthrow
may
be
attempted
or
accomplished.
now
that
almost
sounds
constitutional.
but
then,
and
mind
you
were
talking
about
and
this
crucial
to
my
argument.
we
are
talking
about
the
overthrow
of
the
government
of
the
state
of
new
york.
we
are
not
talking
about
the
united
states
government.
so
now
the
court
goes
on
having
made
that
statement,
there
is
no
doubt
this
is
applying
the
law
to
the
facts.
there
is
no
doubt
that
epton
intended
to
inflame
the
already
intense
passions
of
the
troubled
people
of
harlem
and
to
incite
them
to
greater
violence.
furthermore,
defendant's
exhortations
calling
for
organized
resistance
to
the
police
and
the
destruction
of
the
state
in
the
setting
of
harlem
during
the
week
of
july
18th
formed
a
sufficient
basis
for
the
trial
court
and
jury
to
conclude
that
his
words
and
actions
created
a
clear
and
present
danger
that
the
riots
then
rocking
harlem
would
be
intensified
or
if
they
see
subsided
rekindled.
now
i
submit
that
the
gloss
that
the
court
of
appeals
put
on
the
anarchy
statute
was
gloss
on
a
riot
state
and
was
not
on
an
anarchy
statute
and
because
the
evil
that
the
legislature
has
a
right
to
proscribe
would
be
the
overthrow
of
the
government
of
the
state
of
new
york
if
you
follow
their
logic.
now
i
say
that
court
of
appeals
made
this
error
for
a
historical
reason
because
there
can
be
no
illegal
act
of
the
overthrow
of
state
government.
there
can't
be
ever
since
1789
when
the
constitution
was
ratified.
and
i
want
to
go
back
in
the
history
to
remind,
your
honors
of
the
fact
that
there
was
once
a
rebellion
against
the
state
government
before
the
constitution
was
ratified
and
during
the
period
that
the
articles
of
confederation
kept
our
country
together.
and
that
rebellion
was
called
shay's
rebellion
and
it
came
about
when
the
soldiers
came
back
from
the
revolutionary
war
and
they
found
that
creditors
were
making
things
very
difficult,
they
were
in
debt
and
they
did
not
like
it
and
the
next
thing,
there
was
a
rebellion
and
it
was
lead
by
a
man
by
the
name
of
daniel
shay
and
it
was
put
down
by
a
general
benjamin
lincoln
who
had
to
be
paid
for
efforts
from
the
coffers
of
the
state
of
massachusetts
because
there
was
no
federal
government.
and
it
was
shay's
rebellion,
the
last
rebellion
against
the
state
government
that
gave
the
impetus
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
and
so
it
is
that
hamilton
writing
in
1787
in
the
minutes
of
the
proceedings
of
the
constitutional
convention
said,
“how
are
all
these
evils
to
be
avoided?”
and
these
evils
of
course
are
the
evils
of
the
shays'
rebellion.
only
by
a
complete
sovereignty
in
the
general
government,
the
general
power
must
swallow
up
the
state
powers.
otherwise,
it
will
be
swallowed
by
them.
two
sovereignties
--
i
should
have
learned.
two
sovereignties
can
not
co-exist
within
the
same
limit.
now
general
washington
also
had
occasion
to
comment
on
this
problem
and
in
a
letter
written
in
1787,
the
same
year
that
hamilton
was
writing,
he
said,
“you
will
long
ere
this
have
heard
of
the
insurrection
in
the
state
of
massachusetts.”
these
disorders
are
evident
marks
of
defective
government.
indeed,
the
thinking
part
of
the
country,
of
the
people
of
this
country
are
now
so
well
satisfied
of
this
fact
that
most
of
the
legislatures
have
appointed
and
the
rest,
it
is
said
will
appoint
delegates
to
meet
at
philadelphia
on
the
second
monday
in
may
next
in
a
general
convention
of
the
states
to
revise
and
correct
the
defects
of
the
federal
system.
and
then
it
was
thomas
jefferson
who
wrote
in
a
letter
to
madison
the
same
year.
the
late
rebellion
in
massachusetts
has
given
more
alarm
than
i
think
it
should
have
done.
calculate
that
one
rebellion
in
13
states
in
the
course
of
11
years,
is
but
one
for
each
state
in
a
century
and
a
half.
no
country
should
be
so
long
without
one.
nor
will
any
degree
of
power
in
the
hands
of
government
prevent
insurrection.
let
me
add
that
a
bill
of
rights
is
what
the
people
are
entitled
to
against
every
government
on
earth,
general
or
particular
and
what
no
just
government
shall
refuse
or
rest
or
let
rest
on
influence.
now,
why
i
am
reading
these
quotations?
because
of
course
you
can
not
have
the
overthrow
of
a
state
government
and
so
that
whole
law
itself
is
an
absurdity.
there
was
argument
in
the
case
of
pennsylvania
against
nelson
which
we
have
urged
in
out
briefs
with
regard
to
unconstitutionality
of
this
law,
which
underlines
with
the
coming
of
the
smith
act,
the
supersedure
of
the
sedition
field
by
the
federal
government.
but
i
think
a
better
argument
than
the
argument
made
by
this
court
there
is
the
fact
that
you
really
can
not
have
--
the
overthrow
of
a
state
government
because
the
minute
that
government
is
threatened
with
its
overthrow,
it
is
a
matter
of
federal
concern.
now
you
can
have
acts,
you
can
have
acts
proscribed
which
disturb
the
public
peace
which
you
can
proscribe
them
to
be
of
a
greater
degree
if
they
impinge
upon
the
state
house
or
if
--
it
seems
to
me
that
you
can
describe
crimes
in
many
ways,
having
to
do
with
the
imagination
of
the
legislatures
and
of
the
prosecutors
to
meet
the
situation.
but
that
it
is
a
travesty
to
go
back
to
a
law
such
as
the
anarchy
statute
of
1902
and
to
believe
that
by
putting
a
gloss
on
it,
taking
out
the
general
government
and
pretending
that
it
isn't
there
that
you
really
talking
about
the
government
of
the
state
of
new
york,
you
can
make
that
law
constitutional.
now
the
bill
of
rights
aspect
what
jefferson
had
to
say
also
brings
me
back
to
the
first
amendment
and
to
the
importance
of
the
first
amendment
in
the
considerations
in
this
case.
my
client
is
being
charged
with
three
felony
counts
of
anarchy
and
one
misdemeanor
count
of
anarchy
and
one
count
of
ars
--
conspiracy
to
commit
arson
in
the
third
degree
which
in
new
york
is
a
misdemeanor.
now
you
will
hear
from
mr.
ludwig
if,
that
is
if
he
says
what
he
has
said
on
other
occasions
before
you,
why
you
have
asked
him,
“do
you
need
this
anarchy
counts
in
an
indictment
which
has
serious
gun
possession
charges
and
one
arson
count,
conspiracy
to
commit
arson
in
the
third
degree?”
and
he
will
tell
you
as
he
did
in
his
briefs
that
the
anarchy
is
necessary
to
prove
the
illegal
intent
of
the
defendants.
now
following
that
logic
as
to
my
client,
my
client
in
order
to
prove
his
intent
for
one
count
of
conspiracy
in
the
third
degree
to
commit
arson
which
is
a
misdemeanor
is
being
charged
with
three
felony
counts.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
tail
is
wagging
the
dog
or
there
is
something
disproportionate
about
the
state
of
affairs.
i
have
as
i
said
outlined
to
you
before
the
reasons
i
believe
this
is
a
most
compelling
case.
it
involves
the
first
amendment
in
the
sense
of
it
being
the
public
business.
in
the
complaint
against
my
defendant,
he
is
charged
with
disseminating
pamphlets
and
their
titles
are
mentioned
in
the
indictment.
those
titles
are
total
resistance.
this
is
in
writing.
this
is
something
that
has
been
written
called
total
resistance
in
writing,
community
self
defense,
and
the
struggle
for
black
state
power
in
the
united
states.
now,
every
charge
in
anarchy,
except
the
first
one
mentions
specifically
the
fact
that
he
is
supporting
and
disseminating
these
documents.
now
certainly
a
statute
or
a
law
which
would
permit
someone
being
criminally
prosecuted
for
the
dissemination
of
these
pamphlets
is
overbroad,
and
it
goes
to
the
heart
of
his
rights
under
the
first
amendment.
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
yes,
there
are
other
overt
acts
having
to
do
with
suggesting
violent
activities.
well,
let's
see.
act
obtained
and
possessed
in
the
county
of
queens
at
indeterminate
amount
of
gun
powder
for
making
explosive.
he
is
charge
and
as
to
any
kind
of
--
those
are
overt
acts
of
course.
i
do
not
know
whether
my
defendant
--
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
no,
but
i
believe
that
a
law
that
would
proscribe
the
possession
of
dynamite
in
large
quantities
would
be
perfectly
constitutional.
but
a
law
that
includes
in
its
ambit,
the
distribution
of
leaflets
it
seems
to
me
is
not.
and
we
have
a
time
in
the
period
of
our
country
when
dissent
in
raising
its
voice
and
when
people
are
dissatisfied
and
when
the
black
people
are
dissatisfied
and
when
they
are
--
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
but
maybe
the
jury
would
be
affected
in
his
judgment
as
to
what
--
whether
it
might
be
a
fact
issue
on
the
dynamite
and
guns
and
maybe
the
jury
would
be
affected
by
hearing
what
his
thoughts
are
with
regard
to
community
self-defense.
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
well
only
because
my
client
is
being
charged
with
advocating
the
doctrine
of
the
overthrow
of
the
government
of
the
state
of
new
york
and
i
am
saying
that
that
kind
of
a
charge
against
my
client
is
inappropriate
and
is
prejudicial
and
further
more
invades
a
very,
very
basic
right
under
the
first
amendment.
and
that
when
the
things
are
jumbled
up
and
put
together,
it
may
well
be
that
the
prejudice
of
the
anarchy
charge
will
lead
to
a
conviction
on
the
other
charges.
the
other
charge,
its
arson
in
the
third
degree
is
the
only
other
charge
my
client
is
charged
with.
i
think
that
this
case
has
an
overwhelming
compulsion
and
i
urge,
your
honors
to
read
the
four
points
that
i
made
in
a
very
brief,
brief
which
i
have
just
filed
with
the
court
having
to
do
with
the
peculiar
situation
as
to
why
relief
is
requested
here
and
i
also
wish
to
urge
upon
you
that
if
i
can
not
get
all
i
want,
meaning
i
want
in
injunction
as
judge
friendly
paraphrased
a
description
of
the
legislature
in
19
--
the
legislature
passing
the
anarchy
law
in
1902,
i
want
all
i
can
get.
thank
you.
ms.
eleanor
jackson
piel
thank
you.
i'm
not
sure
i
will
take
all
my
time.
i
do
wish
to
disabuse
the
court
of
a
thought
which
came
across
my
mind
as
i
sat
down
and
that
was
the
--
i
sought
the
enjoining
of
the
entire
prosecution
in
this
case.
it
is
true
that
when
i
commenced,
i
challenged
the
grand
jury
statutes
of
the
state
of
new
york,
which
of
course
were
right
to
prevail
would
have
invalidated
the
entire
prosecution.
setting
up
the
challenge
to
the
grand
jury
statutes
although
we
maintain
they
were
unconstitutional
because
that
challenge
did
not
meet
the
test
of
the
first
amendment.
i
would
prove
that
position
and
i
do
not
feel
that
the
entire
prosecution
should
be
invalidated.
in
fact,
and
i
wish
to
underline
it,
the
only
challenge
in
the
plaintiff
and
appellant
fernandez'
case
is
to
the
anarchy
statutes
of
the
state
of
new
york.
now
this
prosecution
with
regard
to
arson
in
the
third
degree
in
so
far
as
these
pleadings
are
concerned
is
perfectly
appropriate
and
should
proceed.
