mr.
weinstein
as
the
two
courts
below
said,
they're
not
really
separate
taxes,
they're
merged
into
one.
the
use
taxes
in
so
much
as
a
matter
of
raising
revenue
by
itself,
but
it's
a
complement
in
a
means
of
enforcing
the
sales
tax.
and
i
would
suggest
that
this
is
double
taxation
when
a
sale
--
serviceman
buys
a
car
in
one
state
and
is
charged
a
sales
tax
and
he
goes
to
the
other
--
another
state
where
he
is
then
charged
a
use
tax,
which
use
tax
would
not
have
been
imposed
if
he
had
originally
bought
the
car
in
the
second
state
and
paid
a
sales
tax.
mr.
weinstein
in
one
of
two
situations.
if
as
commander
foster
tried
to
do,
the
serviceman
seeks
to
register
his
car
in
his
home
state,
generally
the
home
state
will
seek
to
impose
a
tax.
the
other
thing
which
comes
to
the
potential
of
double
taxation
which
is
also
within
the
purposes
of
this
statute
is
that
ultimately,
we
would
--
i'd
assume
the
serviceman
is
going
home.
and
when
he
goes
home
he
brings
back
his
property
with
him
whatever
he's
acquired.
and
at
that
time,
he
is
going
to
be
subjected
to
a
use
tax
on
this
property.
and
this
is
the
point
in
time
when
double
taxation
is
almost
certain.
i
suggest
really
in
terms
of
potential
for
double
taxation,
this
ought
to
be
compared
to
the
structure
of
the
ad
valorem
taxation.
ad
valorem
taxation
isn't
going
to
be
doubly
imposed
anymore
frequently
than
the
use
tax
or
in
sales
tax
structures.
it
would
really
depend
on
the
accident
of
a
man
being
switched
from
jurisdiction
to
jurisdiction
within
one
year
being
in
one
state
on
its
ad
valorem
tax
day,
and
then
in
another
state
later
in
the
year
or
earlier
on
its
ad
valorem
tax
day.
mr.
weinstein
that's
right.
mr.
weinstein
that's
right.
sales
tax
--
mr.
weinstein
that
is
our
position.
i
think
that
the
other
side
argues
that
the
phrase,
the
initial
phrase
of
the
statute
for
the
purposes
of
taxation
in
respect
to
personal
property
means
only
ad
valorem
taxation
in
respect
personal
property.
it
doesn't
catch
any
other
tax.
and
i
see
that
my
--
mr.
weinstein
in
speaking
of
personal
property,
justice
fortas,
i
think
there
are
two
potential
bases
for
imposing
a
tax,
and
they're
dealt
within
two
separate
sentences
here.
one
is
a
tax
that
proceeds
on
residence
or
domicile
on
taxes
personal
property.
mr.
weinstein
no.
mr.
weinstein
no,
and
that
is
the
first
sentence
justice
fortas.
mr.
weinstein
now,
the
sentence
that
begins
on
the
top
of
page
3
in
the
middle
of
the
first
line
which
again
begins
for
the
purposes
of
taxation
in
respect
of,
it
doesn't
say
person
now,
but
personal
property,
income
or
gross
income.
first,
it
defines
the
--
mr.
weinstein
of
any
such
person.
now
--
mr.
weinstein
yes,
and
that
would
be
i
think
a
reference
to
the
“any
person”
in
the
first
sentence
perhaps
modified,
and
i
suppose
modified
by
the
language
--
person
being
absent
there
from,
from
his
home
state
in
compliance
with
military
or
naval
orders
in
the
first
sentence.
and
then
as
you
go
one
in
this
sentence,
first
it
describes
a
source
of
income
and
says
military
pay
shall
not
be
deemed
to
be
from
within
the
home
state.
and
then
for
present
purposes,
the
language
is
personal
property
shall
not
be
deemed
to
be
located
or
present
in
or
to
have
a
situs
for
taxation
in
such
state
territory
possession
or
political
division
or
district.
mr.
weinstein
i
think
that
that
--
whether
that
is
so
depends
on
how
the
sales
and
use
tax
statutes
work.
now,
use
tax
statutes
are
applied
only
when
property
is
within
and
used
within
the
--
mr.
weinstein
yes,
but
the
sales
tax
--
mr.
weinstein
yes,
but
the
sales
tax
also
depends
on
physical
presence
of
the
property
in
the
taxing
jurisdiction.
under
the
connecticut
statute
and
while
the
language
is
different
in
other
states,
the
effect
is
the
same.
the
tax
is
imposed
only
when
there
is
a
sale
and
when
physical
possession
is
taken
in
the
taxing
jurisdiction.
mr.
weinstein
this
is
the
same
kind
of
tax
that
was
before
the
court
last
term
in
the
massachusetts
bank
case
and
it's
a
vendee
tax.
the
legal
incidence
is
on
the
buyer.
the
seller
is
given
an
action
in
debt
to
collect
--
and
is
directed
to
pass
the
tax
on
to
the
buyer.
and
it's
clearly
a
vendee
tax.
mr.
weinstein
the
seller
is
liable
to
the
state.
the
buyer
is
liable
to
the
seller.
and
it's
the
same
structure
as
this
court
labeled
a
vendee
tax
last
term.
mr.
weinstein
well
--
mr.
weinstein
it's
imposed
on
the
sale
of
tangible
personal
property.
so
that
it
purports
to
be
on
the
sale,
but
it's
not
just
the
sale
alone.
there
must
be
tangible
personal
property.
and
the
word
sale
and
selling
are
defined
in
the
statute,
in
the
connecticut
statute
in
words
that
are
quoted
in
pages
28
and
29
of
the
brief
here.
and
it
says
mean
and
include
any
transfer
of
title,
exchange
or
barter
and
so
forth.now,
transfer
of
title
under
the
general
rule
of
the
uniform
commercial
code
which
applies
in
connecticut
and
i
think
almost
all
states
by
now
is
the
title
is
transferred
when
the
seller's
responsibility
is
asked
to
delivery
or
complete
it,
so
that
this
definition
of
sale
incorporates
a
concept
of
a
transfer
of
physical
possession
so
that
you
can't
view
the
sale
tax
as
simply
being
on
some
abstract
privilege
of
selling.
mr.
weinstein
well,
if
there
is
no
transfer
of
possession,
if
the
property
is
supposed
to
stay
a
word
as
this
brings
in
to
play
a
different
part
of
the
uniform
commercial
code
which
would
transfer
title
at
that
earlier
time.
but
i
think
where
we're
talking
here
about
movable
chattels,
boats,
cars,
appliances,
things
of
that
sort,
there
are
things
that
contemplate
transfer.
mr.
weinstein
food
and
drink
under
the
stipulation,
i
think
would
--
the
stipulation
says
that
everyday
purchases
are
made
in
the
post-exchange
or
commissary.
and
those
under
the
buck
act
which
is
i
think
section
107
of
title
4
are
explicitly
exempt
from
sales
and
use
tax.
mr.
weinstein
i
didn't
understand
that
to
be
in
the
stipulation.
i
just
understood
that
that
--
mr.
weinstein
well,
if
i
can
avoid
the
cigarette
tax
which
is
different
state
--
mr.
weinstein
i'll
take
the
sales
tax
on
it.
mr.
weinstein
such
say
a
tube
of
toothpaste
which
--
mr.
weinstein
i
think
the
position
on
this
side
of
the
case
would
be
that
the
exemption
applies
simply
because
there
is
no
way
of
parsing
neither
section
514
or
the
connecticut
tax
to
apply
to
only
to
say
big
ticket
items
and
not
to
small
purchase.
mr.
weinstein
yes,
i
think
the
impact.
i'm
saying
that
that's
the
thrust
of
the
legislative
judgment
in
this
statute.
the
function
of
the
stipulation
i
think
is
to
show
that
that
kind
of
impact
is
not
likely
to
exist
because
purchases
of
this
kind
are
not
made
in
stores
that
are
generally
subject
to
that
type
of
--
to
the
state
tax
but
are
made
in
official
installations
where
the
tax
doesn't
apply.
mr.
weinstein
yes,
i
think
whether
that
would
fall
under
section
514.
mr.
weinstein
i'd
like
to
start
by
saying
i
don't
think
that's
in
this
case.
at
least
it
has
--
mr.
weinstein
well,
i
think
i've
struggle
with
the
problem
of
how
do
you
characterize
the
right
to
occupy
a
motel
or
hotel
room
for
a
night.
and
under
section
514
the
problem
comes
down
to
whether
you
can
characterize
this
right
as
an
intangible
personal
property.
if
it
is,
it
would
be
exempt.
i
suspect
it
isn't.
it
seems
to
more
in
the
nature
of
a
real
property
interest
which
would
not
be
caught.
but
whether
that
comes
under
section
514
is
a
rather
different
problem
than
these
admittedly
tangible
items
which
have
physical
location
that
do
move
around,
where
a
hotel
room
doesn't
and
certainly
seem
to
be
the
type
of
objects
that
section
514
was
intended
to
deal
with.
now,
there
are
other
points
that
i
think
are
adequately
covered
in
part
1
of
the
brief
which
is
the
discussion
of
the
buck
act,
the
supposed
administrative
problems
and
the
constitutional
attack
which
i
think
this
court
put
to
rest
in
the
case
of
dameron
against
brodhead
some
years
ago.
mr.
weinstein
i
would
think
that
the
existence
of
the
controversy
--
again
i
would
like
to
go
back
to
the
confession
situation,
because
in
the
confession
situation
the
government
is
clearly
saying
now,
we
don't
think
now
that
in
a
criminal
case
this
man
could've
been
prosecuted
or
should've
been
prosecuted
in
this
way.
mr.
weinstein
the
very
least
there
is
here
is
a
controversy
between
the
servicemen
and
the
state,
which
--
mr.
weinstein
the
difficulty
i
have
is
in
distinguishing
between
this
case
as
i
said
and
i
guess
i'm
not
adding
anything
new
to
what
i've
said
in
any
instance
of
confession
of
error.
i
think
that
the
--
what
you're
saying
would
lead
to
the
route
that
if
there
is
a
confession
of
error
that
would
moot
the
controversy,
certainly
if
the
confession
went
to
the
propriety
of
the
charge
say
that
was
brought
as
opposed
to
some
--
mr.
weinstein
if
this
were
the
district
court
or
court
of
appeals
after
last
wednesday,
i'd
have
to
agree
with
that
because
i
think
it
was
last
wednesday
that
decided
the
case.
and
i
don't
think
it
was
a
prediction
of
that
outcome
that
--
mr.
weinstein
well
he
was
just
--
you
mean
why
did
he
not
appeal?
mr.
weinstein
he
was
this
--
are
you
taking
about
the
arlington
county
case?
mr.
weinstein
i'm
sorry
i
was
confused.
mr.
weinstein
i'm
not
certain
about
it,
but
i
assume
its
reason
similar
to
this
case
where
one
man
would
not
ordinarily
have
$10,000.00
jurisdiction
alone.
mr.
weinstein
yes,
but
if
i
can
just
try
once
more
on
this
analogy.
suppose
a
criminal
charge
is
brought
and
the
claim
of
the
defendant
is
that
this
charge
is
barred
by
the
constitution
and
this
is
the
matter
in
which
the
case
is
litigated.
and
in
this
court
there
is
a
confession
of
error
to
it
a
statement
that
it
is
then
the
position
of
the
united
states
that
this
charge
is
indeed
unconstitutional.
now,
i
--
mr.
weinstein
i
would
think
--
mr.
weinstein
perhaps
this
would
--
it
seems
to
me
that
the
united
states
which
clearly
has
a
function
as
a
guardian
for
certain
purposes
of
servicemen,
in
that
capacity
would
have
a
capacity
that
is
different
and
distinct
from
its
position
as
its
general
position
as
sovereign.
mr.
weinstein
yes,
but
i
think
it
is
part
of
that
because
the
servicemen's
interest
--
mr.
weinstein
i
think
that
you
--
it's
hard
to
know
what
would
have
done.
for
example,
it
would
be
entirely
possible
for
the
department
of
justice
to
appear
on
behalf
of
the
other
side
of
the
case.
now
perhaps
then
it
would
have
been
brought
in
a
state
court
rather
than
the
federal
court.
now,
i
think
--
i
would
suggest
the
district
court
and
court
of
appeals
jurisdiction
has
to
be
viewed
in
terms
of
what
the
situation
was
at
that
time.
this
court
is
---
would
have
jurisdiction
certainly
of
this
case
and
it
came
up
through
the
state
system,
and
if
you
were
to
argue
that
the
case
or
controversy
has
disappeared
as
between
the
united
states,
i
think
in
terms
of
this
court's
jurisdiction,
it
still
has
to
be
considered
in
terms
of
the
existence
a
capacity
on
the
united
states
to
appear
as
the
representative,
as
the
guardian
of
the
servicemen.
mr.
weinstein
but
that
an
issue
which
would
depend
on
something
that
developed
after
the
decision
in
the
district
court
and
court
of
appeals.
mr.
weinstein
well
as
i
--
it
is
--
as
i
said
it
is
uncommon.
as
i
said
earlier,
i
do
not
think
it
is
unprecedented.
and
it
occurs
to
me
now
that
there
is
a
case
that
i
might
have
cited
that
would
be
somewhat
better
for
this
purpose
than
the
kornhauser
case,
and
perhaps
i
should've
cited
it
first.
and
i
think
this
is
burnet
against
northern
trust
company.
again
a
tax
case,
i
believe
from
the
1930's
and
i
--
it
may
be
in
283
united
states
reports,
i'm
not
certain.
but
this
is
a
situation
where
the
brief
had
one
half
prepared
--
one
part
prepared
by
the
revenue,
by
the
treasury
department
and
the
other
half
by
the
department
of
justice.
and
the
treasury
appeared
to
present
its
case,
although
the
controversy
is
as
much
there
between
the
government
and
the
taxpayer.
mr.
weinstein
i
suppose
the
case
would
be
--
had
been
closer
to
the
northern
trust
if
this
case
had
been
brought
in
the
name
of
the
secretary
of
defense
as
the
northern
trust
case
was
brought
against
the
collector
of
internal
revenue.
mr.
weinstein
i
did
not
in
--
i
hope
i
didn't
characterize
my
function
in
that
way.
i
tried
to
put
it
in
terms
of
the
being
assigned
to
come
here
for
an
adversarial
presentation.
mr.
weinstein
no,
i
cannot
say
i
did.
mr.
weinstein
well,
i
think
i'll
cite
what
i
can
offer
on
this
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
weinstein
as
the
two
courts
below
said,
they're
not
really
separate
taxes,
they're
merged
into
one.
the
use
taxes
in
so
much
as
a
matter
of
raising
revenue
by
itself,
but
it's
a
complement
in
a
means
of
enforcing
the
sales
tax.
and
i
would
suggest
that
this
is
double
taxation
when
a
sale
--
serviceman
buys
a
car
in
one
state
and
is
charged
a
sales
tax
and
he
goes
to
the
other
--
another
state
where
he
is
then
charged
a
use
tax,
which
use
tax
would
not
have
been
imposed
if
he
had
originally
bought
the
car
in
the
second
state
and
paid
a
sales
tax.
mr.
weinstein
in
one
of
two
situations.
if
as
commander
foster
tried
to
do,
the
serviceman
seeks
to
register
his
car
in
his
home
state,
generally
the
home
state
will
seek
to
impose
a
tax.
the
other
thing
which
comes
to
the
potential
of
double
taxation
which
is
also
within
the
purposes
of
this
statute
is
that
ultimately,
we
would
--
i'd
assume
the
serviceman
is
going
home.
and
when
he
goes
home
he
brings
back
his
property
with
him
whatever
he's
acquired.
and
at
that
time,
he
is
going
to
be
subjected
to
a
use
tax
on
this
property.
and
this
is
the
point
in
time
when
double
taxation
is
almost
certain.
i
suggest
really
in
terms
of
potential
for
double
taxation,
this
ought
to
be
compared
to
the
structure
of
the
ad
valorem
taxation.
ad
valorem
taxation
isn't
going
to
be
doubly
imposed
anymore
frequently
than
the
use
tax
or
in
sales
tax
structures.
it
would
really
depend
on
the
accident
of
a
man
being
switched
from
jurisdiction
to
jurisdiction
within
one
year
being
in
one
state
on
its
ad
valorem
tax
day,
and
then
in
another
state
later
in
the
year
or
earlier
on
its
ad
valorem
tax
day.
mr.
weinstein
that's
right.
mr.
weinstein
that's
right.
sales
tax
--
mr.
weinstein
that
is
our
position.
i
think
that
the
other
side
argues
that
the
phrase,
the
initial
phrase
of
the
statute
for
the
purposes
of
taxation
in
respect
to
personal
property
means
only
ad
valorem
taxation
in
respect
personal
property.
it
doesn't
catch
any
other
tax.
and
i
see
that
my
--
mr.
weinstein
in
speaking
of
personal
property,
justice
fortas,
i
think
there
are
two
potential
bases
for
imposing
a
tax,
and
they're
dealt
within
two
separate
sentences
here.
one
is
a
tax
that
proceeds
on
residence
or
domicile
on
taxes
personal
property.
mr.
weinstein
no.
mr.
weinstein
no,
and
that
is
the
first
sentence
justice
fortas.
mr.
weinstein
now,
the
sentence
that
begins
on
the
top
of
page
3
in
the
middle
of
the
first
line
which
again
begins
for
the
purposes
of
taxation
in
respect
of,
it
doesn't
say
person
now,
but
personal
property,
income
or
gross
income.
first,
it
defines
the
--
mr.
weinstein
of
any
such
person.
now
--
mr.
weinstein
yes,
and
that
would
be
i
think
a
reference
to
the
“any
person”
in
the
first
sentence
perhaps
modified,
and
i
suppose
modified
by
the
language
--
person
being
absent
there
from,
from
his
home
state
in
compliance
with
military
or
naval
orders
in
the
first
sentence.
and
then
as
you
go
one
in
this
sentence,
first
it
describes
a
source
of
income
and
says
military
pay
shall
not
be
deemed
to
be
from
within
the
home
state.
and
then
for
present
purposes,
the
language
is
personal
property
shall
not
be
deemed
to
be
located
or
present
in
or
to
have
a
situs
for
taxation
in
such
state
territory
possession
or
political
division
or
district.
mr.
weinstein
i
think
that
that
--
whether
that
is
so
depends
on
how
the
sales
and
use
tax
statutes
work.
now,
use
tax
statutes
are
applied
only
when
property
is
within
and
used
within
the
--
mr.
weinstein
yes,
but
the
sales
tax
--
mr.
weinstein
yes,
but
the
sales
tax
also
depends
on
physical
presence
of
the
property
in
the
taxing
jurisdiction.
under
the
connecticut
statute
and
while
the
language
is
different
in
other
states,
the
effect
is
the
same.
the
tax
is
imposed
only
when
there
is
a
sale
and
when
physical
possession
is
taken
in
the
taxing
jurisdiction.
mr.
weinstein
this
is
the
same
kind
of
tax
that
was
before
the
court
last
term
in
the
massachusetts
bank
case
and
it's
a
vendee
tax.
the
legal
incidence
is
on
the
buyer.
the
seller
is
given
an
action
in
debt
to
collect
--
and
is
directed
to
pass
the
tax
on
to
the
buyer.
and
it's
clearly
a
vendee
tax.
mr.
weinstein
the
seller
is
liable
to
the
state.
the
buyer
is
liable
to
the
seller.
and
it's
the
same
structure
as
this
court
labeled
a
vendee
tax
last
term.
mr.
weinstein
well
--
mr.
weinstein
it's
imposed
on
the
sale
of
tangible
personal
property.
so
that
it
purports
to
be
on
the
sale,
but
it's
not
just
the
sale
alone.
there
must
be
tangible
personal
property.
and
the
word
sale
and
selling
are
defined
in
the
statute,
in
the
connecticut
statute
in
words
that
are
quoted
in
pages
28
and
29
of
the
brief
here.
and
it
says
mean
and
include
any
transfer
of
title,
exchange
or
barter
and
so
forth.now,
transfer
of
title
under
the
general
rule
of
the
uniform
commercial
code
which
applies
in
connecticut
and
i
think
almost
all
states
by
now
is
the
title
is
transferred
when
the
seller's
responsibility
is
asked
to
delivery
or
complete
it,
so
that
this
definition
of
sale
incorporates
a
concept
of
a
transfer
of
physical
possession
so
that
you
can't
view
the
sale
tax
as
simply
being
on
some
abstract
privilege
of
selling.
mr.
weinstein
well,
if
there
is
no
transfer
of
possession,
if
the
property
is
supposed
to
stay
a
word
as
this
brings
in
to
play
a
different
part
of
the
uniform
commercial
code
which
would
transfer
title
at
that
earlier
time.
but
i
think
where
we're
talking
here
about
movable
chattels,
boats,
cars,
appliances,
things
of
that
sort,
there
are
things
that
contemplate
transfer.
mr.
weinstein
food
and
drink
under
the
stipulation,
i
think
would
--
the
stipulation
says
that
everyday
purchases
are
made
in
the
post-exchange
or
commissary.
and
those
under
the
buck
act
which
is
i
think
section
107
of
title
4
are
explicitly
exempt
from
sales
and
use
tax.
mr.
weinstein
i
didn't
understand
that
to
be
in
the
stipulation.
i
just
understood
that
that
--
mr.
weinstein
well,
if
i
can
avoid
the
cigarette
tax
which
is
different
state
--
mr.
weinstein
i'll
take
the
sales
tax
on
it.
mr.
weinstein
such
say
a
tube
of
toothpaste
which
--
mr.
weinstein
i
think
the
position
on
this
side
of
the
case
would
be
that
the
exemption
applies
simply
because
there
is
no
way
of
parsing
neither
section
514
or
the
connecticut
tax
to
apply
to
only
to
say
big
ticket
items
and
not
to
small
purchase.
mr.
weinstein
yes,
i
think
the
impact.
i'm
saying
that
that's
the
thrust
of
the
legislative
judgment
in
this
statute.
the
function
of
the
stipulation
i
think
is
to
show
that
that
kind
of
impact
is
not
likely
to
exist
because
purchases
of
this
kind
are
not
made
in
stores
that
are
generally
subject
to
that
type
of
--
to
the
state
tax
but
are
made
in
official
installations
where
the
tax
doesn't
apply.
mr.
weinstein
yes,
i
think
whether
that
would
fall
under
section
514.
mr.
weinstein
i'd
like
to
start
by
saying
i
don't
think
that's
in
this
case.
at
least
it
has
--
mr.
weinstein
well,
i
think
i've
struggle
with
the
problem
of
how
do
you
characterize
the
right
to
occupy
a
motel
or
hotel
room
for
a
night.
and
under
section
514
the
problem
comes
down
to
whether
you
can
characterize
this
right
as
an
intangible
personal
property.
if
it
is,
it
would
be
exempt.
i
suspect
it
isn't.
it
seems
to
more
in
the
nature
of
a
real
property
interest
which
would
not
be
caught.
but
whether
that
comes
under
section
514
is
a
rather
different
problem
than
these
admittedly
tangible
items
which
have
physical
location
that
do
move
around,
where
a
hotel
room
doesn't
and
certainly
seem
to
be
the
type
of
objects
that
section
514
was
intended
to
deal
with.
now,
there
are
other
points
that
i
think
are
adequately
covered
in
part
1
of
the
brief
which
is
the
discussion
of
the
buck
act,
the
supposed
administrative
problems
and
the
constitutional
attack
which
i
think
this
court
put
to
rest
in
the
case
of
dameron
against
brodhead
some
years
ago.
mr.
weinstein
i
would
think
that
the
existence
of
the
controversy
--
again
i
would
like
to
go
back
to
the
confession
situation,
because
in
the
confession
situation
the
government
is
clearly
saying
now,
we
don't
think
now
that
in
a
criminal
case
this
man
could've
been
prosecuted
or
should've
been
prosecuted
in
this
way.
mr.
weinstein
the
very
least
there
is
here
is
a
controversy
between
the
servicemen
and
the
state,
which
--
mr.
weinstein
the
difficulty
i
have
is
in
distinguishing
between
this
case
as
i
said
and
i
guess
i'm
not
adding
anything
new
to
what
i've
said
in
any
instance
of
confession
of
error.
i
think
that
the
--
what
you're
saying
would
lead
to
the
route
that
if
there
is
a
confession
of
error
that
would
moot
the
controversy,
certainly
if
the
confession
went
to
the
propriety
of
the
charge
say
that
was
brought
as
opposed
to
some
--
mr.
weinstein
if
this
were
the
district
court
or
court
of
appeals
after
last
wednesday,
i'd
have
to
agree
with
that
because
i
think
it
was
last
wednesday
that
decided
the
case.
and
i
don't
think
it
was
a
prediction
of
that
outcome
that
--
mr.
weinstein
well
he
was
just
--
you
mean
why
did
he
not
appeal?
mr.
weinstein
he
was
this
--
are
you
taking
about
the
arlington
county
case?
mr.
weinstein
i'm
sorry
i
was
confused.
mr.
weinstein
i'm
not
certain
about
it,
but
i
assume
its
reason
similar
to
this
case
where
one
man
would
not
ordinarily
have
$10,000.00
jurisdiction
alone.
mr.
weinstein
yes,
but
if
i
can
just
try
once
more
on
this
analogy.
suppose
a
criminal
charge
is
brought
and
the
claim
of
the
defendant
is
that
this
charge
is
barred
by
the
constitution
and
this
is
the
matter
in
which
the
case
is
litigated.
and
in
this
court
there
is
a
confession
of
error
to
it
a
statement
that
it
is
then
the
position
of
the
united
states
that
this
charge
is
indeed
unconstitutional.
now,
i
--
mr.
weinstein
i
would
think
--
mr.
weinstein
perhaps
this
would
--
it
seems
to
me
that
the
united
states
which
clearly
has
a
function
as
a
guardian
for
certain
purposes
of
servicemen,
in
that
capacity
would
have
a
capacity
that
is
different
and
distinct
from
its
position
as
its
general
position
as
sovereign.
mr.
weinstein
yes,
but
i
think
it
is
part
of
that
because
the
servicemen's
interest
--
mr.
weinstein
i
think
that
you
--
it's
hard
to
know
what
would
have
done.
for
example,
it
would
be
entirely
possible
for
the
department
of
justice
to
appear
on
behalf
of
the
other
side
of
the
case.
now
perhaps
then
it
would
have
been
brought
in
a
state
court
rather
than
the
federal
court.
now,
i
think
--
i
would
suggest
the
district
court
and
court
of
appeals
jurisdiction
has
to
be
viewed
in
terms
of
what
the
situation
was
at
that
time.
this
court
is
---
would
have
jurisdiction
certainly
of
this
case
and
it
came
up
through
the
state
system,
and
if
you
were
to
argue
that
the
case
or
controversy
has
disappeared
as
between
the
united
states,
i
think
in
terms
of
this
court's
jurisdiction,
it
still
has
to
be
considered
in
terms
of
the
existence
a
capacity
on
the
united
states
to
appear
as
the
representative,
as
the
guardian
of
the
servicemen.
mr.
weinstein
but
that
an
issue
which
would
depend
on
something
that
developed
after
the
decision
in
the
district
court
and
court
of
appeals.
mr.
weinstein
well
as
i
--
it
is
--
as
i
said
it
is
uncommon.
as
i
said
earlier,
i
do
not
think
it
is
unprecedented.
and
it
occurs
to
me
now
that
there
is
a
case
that
i
might
have
cited
that
would
be
somewhat
better
for
this
purpose
than
the
kornhauser
case,
and
perhaps
i
should've
cited
it
first.
and
i
think
this
is
burnet
against
northern
trust
company.
again
a
tax
case,
i
believe
from
the
1930's
and
i
--
it
may
be
in
283
united
states
reports,
i'm
not
certain.
but
this
is
a
situation
where
the
brief
had
one
half
prepared
--
one
part
prepared
by
the
revenue,
by
the
treasury
department
and
the
other
half
by
the
department
of
justice.
and
the
treasury
appeared
to
present
its
case,
although
the
controversy
is
as
much
there
between
the
government
and
the
taxpayer.
mr.
weinstein
i
suppose
the
case
would
be
--
had
been
closer
to
the
northern
trust
if
this
case
had
been
brought
in
the
name
of
the
secretary
of
defense
as
the
northern
trust
case
was
brought
against
the
collector
of
internal
revenue.
mr.
weinstein
i
did
not
in
--
i
hope
i
didn't
characterize
my
function
in
that
way.
i
tried
to
put
it
in
terms
of
the
being
assigned
to
come
here
for
an
adversarial
presentation.
mr.
weinstein
no,
i
cannot
say
i
did.
mr.
weinstein
well,
i
think
i'll
cite
what
i
can
offer
on
this
mr.
chief
justice.
