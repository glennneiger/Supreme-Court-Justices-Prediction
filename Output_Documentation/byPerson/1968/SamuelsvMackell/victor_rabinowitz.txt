mr.
victor
rabinowitz
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
this
is
in
appeal
from
a
judgment
of
the
three-judge
statutory
court
sitting
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york
denying
two
plaintiffs
an
injunction
and
declaratory
judgment
against
the
district
attorney
of
queens
county.
the
plaintiffs
sought
an
injunction
and
declaratory
judgment
to
enjoin
their
prosecution
under
the
new
york
criminal
anarchy
statute.
the
facts,
the
relevant
facts
i
think
can
be
very
briefly
stated.
on
june
21,
1967,
the
11
plaintiffs
here
were
indicted
together
with
a
number
of
others,
on
charges
of
advocacy
of
criminal
anarchy
conspiracy
to
commit
the
crime
of
advocacy
of
criminal
anarchy.
two
of
them
were
also
charged
with
permitting
there
premises
to
be
used
for
an
assemblage
of
anarchists.
the
indictment
was
considerably
broader
than
this
in
that
it
had
48
counts
of
which
only
five
come
--
five
are
before
the
court
on
this
application.
the
other
43
counts
all
related
to
specific
crimes,
most
of
them
to
the
possession
of
guns.
contrary
to
the
law
of
the
state
of
new
york,
i
think
there's
also
a
charge
one
of
the
counts
relates
to
a
conspiracy
to
commit
the
crime
of
arson.
this
case,
the
indictment
here
invoked
the
new
york
criminal
anarchy
statute
of
1902,
which
was
first
applied
in
the
period
after
the
first
world
war
of
the
early
20's
in
the
gitlow
case.
and
was
not
applied
again
until
1964
when
it
was
applied
by
new
york
state
in
the
case
of
people
against
epton.
this
resurrection
of
a
moribund
statute
in
the
epton
case
and
the
mass
indictment
in
this
case
which
followed
36
days
after,
the
court
of
appeals
decision
in
epton
poses
a
threat,
we
think,
to
the
radical
political
activity
of
our
time
and
raises
memories
of
the
20's
and
the
prosecutions
of
those
errors
which
clearly
seem
to
us
to
be
inconsistent
with
modern
constitutional
doctrine.
the
plaintiffs
brought
this
action
and
rely
largely
on
the
general
authority
of
this
court
in
cases
such
as
dombrowski
and
cases
which
have
followed
it,
and
so
far
as
declaratory
judgment
is
concerned,
in
zwickler
against
koota.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
no,
sir.
we
argue,
of
course
we'll
come
to
that
in
a
moment,
it's
a
major
part
of
this
case.
the
--
we
argue
that
the
statute
both
on
its
face
and
as
construed
in
gitlow
is
both
vague
and
overbroad
and
it
is
clearly
unconstitutional,
and
i
don't
think
there's
any
argument
about
that.
the
court
of
appeals
of
new
york
held
as
this
court
has
held
on
a
number
of
occasions
that
the
gitlow
case
is
no
longer
law.
in
keyishian
in
this
court
discussed
this
very
statute
at
some
length
and
held
that
it
was
clearly
unconstitutional.
however,
the
defendant
argues
that
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
in
epton,
by
means
of
narrowing
construction
corrected
the
defect.
and
this
view
was
accepted
by
the
three-judge
court.
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
in
its
opinion
narrowing
the
construction
said
that,
“well,
we
think
now
that
the
legislative
intent
of
1902
was
to
write
a
constitutional
statute.”
and
of
course
the
constitutional
doctrine
has
changed
a
good
deal
since
that
time,
and
so
we
will
now
say
that
the
legislature
in
1902
intended
to
conform
to
existing
constitutional
standards.
and
the
three-judge
court
echoed
this
somewhat
ever
epigrammatically
saying,
“if
the
1902
legislature
had
known
it
could
not
have
all
it
wanted,
it
would
have
wanted
all
it
could
have.”
and
on
the
basis
of
this,
it
held
the
construction,
the
narrowing
construction
of
the
gitlow
statute
constitutional.
now,
there
are
two
primary
questions
raised
on
this
face
of
the
case.
the
first
is
whether
that
narrowing
construction
in
epton
is
binding
on
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
at
all.
the
overt
acts
charged
in
this
indictment
all
took
place
before
the
narrowing
construction.
as
i
say
the
indictment
here
was
only
36
days
after
the
decision
of
the
court
in
the
epton
case.
so
that
none
of
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
had
any
notice
at
all
of
the
narrowing
construction
that
the
court
of
appeals
of
new
york
was
going
to,
which
obviously
i
couldn't
tell,
which
later
the
court
of
appeals
of
new
york
was
going
to
read
it
to
the
statute.
and
we
submit
that
the
plaintiffs
can
no
more
be
charged
with
clairvoyance.
if
i
may
echo
what
this
court
suggest
a
couple
of
weeks
ago
in
shuttlesworth,
can
no
more
be
charged
with
clairvoyance
as
to
the
plastic
surgery
that
the
court
of
appeals
were
deployed
to
the
gitlow
statute
then
shuttlesworth
could
be
charged
with
knowing
what
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
was
ultimately
going
to
decide
in
the
ordinance
under
consideration
in
that
case.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
does
your
honor
mean
the
question
of
the
injunction,
the
propriety
of
an
injunction,
the
cameron
against
johnson
problem?
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
well,
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
yes,
sir.
now,
i
certainly
shall,
your
honor.
now,
we
--
we
feel
that
the,
as
i
say
the
act
--
overt
act
here
were
charged
after
were
--
the
narrowing
construction
was
not
the
law
of
the
state
of
new
york,
assuming
that
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
had
the
right
to
do
this
at
all.
it
certainly
was
not
the
law
of
the
state
of
new
york
but
till
after
the
epton
decision
and
we
do
not
believe
that
the
narrowing
construction
or
that
the
defendants
can
be
held
or
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
can
be
held
liable
for
that.
furthermore,
even
in
the
epton
case
the
court
of
appeals
reconstrued
only
subdivision
1
of
the
criminal
anarchy
law
left
subdivision
3
and
4
untouched
so
that
--
as
to
those
statutes,
those
sections
of
the
statutes
were
true
--
which
are
specifically
alleged
in
the
indictment
in
this
case
were
not
construed
at
all.
now,
i
submit
that
the
doctrine
that
a
statute
which
is
clearly
unconstitutional
and
which
everyone
admits
is
unconstitutional
can
be
reconstrued
by
a
court
--
by
the
highest
court
of
the
state
is
really
a
most
dangerous
doctrine.
it
means
that
any
state
can
always
resurrect
the
statute
which
has
been
declared
unconstitutional
by
this
court,
and
without
any
notice
to
the
persons
within
the
state
make
a
silent
statute,
an
invisible
statute,
a
dead
statute
again
come
to
life.
this
is
much
more
extreme
than
the
situation
in
shuttlesworth
because
in
that
case
the
unconstitutional
doctrine
was
--
the
unconstitutional
interpretation
was
pronounced
by
the
commissioner
of
public
safety,
and
mr.
justice
harlan
pointed
out
that
that
was
not
too
reliable
an
interpretation.
here
we
have
an
interpretation
by
the
court
of
appeals.
an
interpretation
which
is
clearly
unconstitutional
in
gitlow
and
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
in
the
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
it
was
upheld
in
gitlow.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
well,
i
think
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
well,
your
honor
let
me
--
when
i
say
everybody
has
agreed
that
may
not
be
true.
this
court
in
keyishian
said
it
was
unconstitutional.
the
new
york
court
said
the
gitlow
statute
as
interpreted
in
gitlow
as
read
by
gitlow
with
the
gitlow
gloss
on
the
statute
was
an
improper
unconstitutional
statute.
this
court
said
so
in
keyishian.
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
said
so
in
epton.
the
queens
county
court
said
so
in
this
case.
so
everyone
agrees.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
no,
because
i
think
that
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
in
the
keyishian
case
said
that
the
gitlow
--
that
discussed
this
specific
statute.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
yes,
sir.
discussed
the
statute
that
was
before
the
court
in
the
gitlow
case
and
said
that
it
was
an
--
it
said
in
rather
strong
language
i
think.
it
said
that
this
statute
is
clearly
impermissible
under
current
constitutional
standards
and
it
discussed
subdivision
3
which
is
one
of
the
sections
here
and
said
that
under
the
statute
as
interpreted
by
gitlow,
a
man
walking
down
a
campus
with
a
copy
of
karl
marx's
doctrine
in
his
hand
might
be
violating
the
law.
i
believe
that
was
the
example
used
by
the
court
in
the
keyishian
case.
so
it
will
not
be
argued
here
today
that
the
gitlow
interpretation
is
any
longer
a
valid
interpretation
under
the
doctrine,
even
if
dennis
for
that
matter
because
even
dennis
in
that
opinion
suggested
that
the
gitlow
case
was
really
doubtful,
and
that
in
many
standards
inconsistent
with,
as
i
say
a
larger
range
of
cases,
the
scales
case,
the
(inaudible)
case,
and
the
whole
range
of
constitutional
decisions
in
the
last
10
years
of
this
court.
so
that
i
think
that
the
situation
is
very
similar
to
the
shuttlesworth
case.
there,
there
was
and
i'm
paraphrasing
the
decision
of
the
court,
but
i
think
it's
the
same
paraphrase
that
mr.
justice
harlan
used.
this
court
held
that
where
a
statute
is
interpreted
in
an
unconstitutional
fashion
by
the
commissioner
of
public
safety
that
mr.
shuttlesworth
had
the
right
to
treat
that
statute
as
void
and
could
not
be
charged
with
clairvoyance
that
the
court
would
later
hold
that
the
commissioner
of
public
safety
was
wrong.
now
here,
we
have
not
the
chief
of
police
holding
--
giving
the
statute
an
unconstitutional
interpretation,
but
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
giving
what
is
today
an
unconstitutional
interpretation.
although,
obviously,
at
the
time
of
the
gitlow
decision
that
ipso
facto
was
unconstitutional
interpretation
because
the
court
so
said
so.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
i
know
you
did
write
it,
your
honor.
and
if
that's
the
way
you
interpreted
it,
i
--
obviously
that's
what
it
must
mean.
i
--
the
language
is
it
would
have
taken
extraordinary
clairvoyance
for
anyone
to
perceive
that
this
language
meant
what
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
was
destined
to
find
that
it
meant
four
years
later.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
and
i
misread
it
if
that's
what
your
honor
meant.
now,
we
feel
that
the
epton
laws
on
the
statute
still
leaves
it
unconstitutional,
and
this
comes
to
your
honor's
and
mr.
justice
harlan's
question.
there
is
still
no
clear
guidance
as
to
what
may
or
may
not
be
done
under
the
statute.
and
one
of
the
most
serious
defects
in
the
court
of
appeals
interpretation
in
the
epton
case
relates
to
the
clear
and
present
danger
or
rather
unsatisfactory
test
under
the
best
of
circumstances.
but
at
least
in
the
dennis
case,
in
applying
the
clear
and
present
danger
test,
the
court
clearly
said
that
there
must
be
a
clear
and
present
danger
of
an
overthrow
of
the
government
of
the
united
states.
in
the
epton
case,
the
court
found
it
quite
sufficient
that
there
was
a
finding
of
clear
and
present
danger
to
commit
a
riot.
now,
if
the
all
that
the
clear
and
present
danger
test
means
in
the
eyes
of
the
new
york
court
of
appeals,
and
if
that
is
the
cause
placed
on
the
statute
now,
is
that
the
crime
of
sedition
requires
only
that
there
be
a
clear
and
present
danger
of
this
order
which
is
a
far
cry
from
the
overthrow
of
the
government
of
the
united
states,
or
even
the
overthrow
of
the
government
of
new
york,
then
i
submit
that
we
still
have
a
statute
that
is
unconstitutional
even
under
the
epton
decision.
now,
in
dombrowski,
this
court
held
that
it
will
not
abstain
in
a
case
such
as
this
--
such
as
was
presented
in
dombrowski,
where
the
policy
reasons
were
operated
against
in
one
of
the
elements
in
the
policy
considerations,
or
among
the
elements
in
the
policy
considerations
in
dombrowski,
which
motivated
the
court
in
deciding
against
the
doctrine
of
abstention,
was
that
this
was
a
first
amendment
situation.
that
it
did
involve
a
statute
which
to
refer
again
to
those
words
which
have
perhaps
been
a
little
overused,
it
did
have
a
chilling
effect
on
those
who,
i
can't
help
it
mr.
justice
stewart,
everybody
says
that.
it
did
have
a
chilling
effect
on
the
operation
of
people
who
are
engaged
in
political
activity
and
that
the
statute
was
of
such
a
nature
that
it
would
require
repeated
applications.
that
the
exact
meaning
of
the
statute
would
have
to
be
hammered
out
in
repeated
prosecutions
over
a
long
period
of
time
in
the
state
courts
if
the
doctrine
of
abstention
was
followed.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
well
has
authority
to
issue
--
to
consider
the
application
for
an
injunction
under
dombrowski
and
i
would
say
mrs.
piel
will
argue
this
a
little
more
fully
of
a
declaratory
judgment
if
(voice
overlap).
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
oh!
no,
sir,
i
would
say
you
also
have
to
show
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
i
think
that
that's
probably
a
broader
reading
of
dombrowski
then.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
well,
i
would
say
that
where
the
state
is
prosecuting,
and
i
may
be
getting
back
to
the
same
point,
your
honor,
let
me
try
to
spell
it
out.
where
the
state
is
prosecuting
in
a
first
amendment
area,
and
where
the
circumstances
are
such
as
to
cast
a
poll
inhibit
the
free
exercise
of
first
amendment
rights
guaranteed
by
the
first
amendment
and
the
fourteenth
that
in
that
kind
of
a
situation,
the
federal
court
has
jurisdiction
to
determine
whether
the
statute
is
a
constitutional
statute
and
whether
it
should
under
all
of
the
standards
that
are
set
forth
under
one
hand
in
dombrowski,
on
the
other
hand
in
douglas
against
jeannette
whether
it
should
or
should
not
abstain.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
well,
i'm
not
sure
for
example
that
an
obscenity
case
would
fall
within
that
category.
i
don't
believe
that
the
chilling
effect
of
a
vague
obscenity
statute
would
be
the
kind
of
thing
that
would
cast
a
poll
on
political
activity
within
the
meaning
of
the
dombrowski
case.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
i
would
say
it
has
to
be
--
it
has
to
be
certainly
first
amendment
activity.
and
i
would
say
when
we're
--
considering
that
we're
talking
about
casting
a
poll
on
the
carrying
on
of
activities,
i
would
say
it
probably
has
to
be
political
activity.
at
least
i
would
have
difficulty
in
extending
it
to
an
obscenity
case.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
i
would
say
it
is
less
serious
in
terms
of
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
--
the
eminence
of
the
importance
of
political
activity,
yes,
sir.
i
don't
think
it
matters
a
great
deal
that
it
may
be
my
personal
view
on
the
matter.
i
don't
think
it
matters
a
great
deal
if
you
have
to
wait
a
couple
of
years
to
find
out
whether
you
can
show
a
movie
or
publish
a
book.
i
do
think
it
matters
a
great
deal
to
wait
a
few
years
to
find
out
whether
you
can
join
an
organization
or
distribute
a
leaflet.
to
engage
in
a
political
campaign
and
do
the
other
--
carry
on
the
other
activities
similar
in
nature.
now,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
in
this
situation,
the
state
was
amply
protected
by
other
laws.
that
is
thereof,
as
i
say
43
counts
and
incidentally,
two
of
the
defendants
were
charged
and
still
since
been
convicted
of
the
crime
of
conspiracy
to
murder.
so
that
the
state
has
weapons
at
its
disposal;
the
gun
statutes,
the
arson
statutes,
the
murder
statutes
and
all
these
other
things
to
take
care
of
a
situation
such
as
this
and
there
doesn't
seem
to
be
any
requirement
in
order
to
protect
the
interest
of
the
state,
while
it
must
impose
on
top
of
this
a
sedition
statute
phrased
in
the
very
broad
and
general
terms
of
the
new
york
statute.
now,
there
are
other
points
which
i
think
i'll
set
forth
in
the
brief,
and
i'm
sharing
my
time
here
with
counsel
in
the
consolidated
case.
there
is
of
course
the
supersession
point
discussed
in
the
nelson
which
is
i
think
adequately
brief
than
which
is
involved
in
the
next
case
harris
against
younger
as
well
as
in
this
one.
and
finally
there
is
the
argument
or
the
problem
of
the
effect
of
section
42
u.s.
code
1983
on
28
u.s.
code
2283,
that
is
the
question
of
whether
the
civil
rights
act
is
an
exception
to
the
provision
of
the
judiciary
code
with
respect
to
granting
injunctions.
that
issue
has
been
before
this
court.
it's
been
argued
by
this
court
so
many
times
that
i
really
don't
think
it
necessary
to
do
it
again.
it
was
presented
in
cameron
against
johnson.
i
think
it's
adequately
brief
that
i
rest
on
that.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
no,
i
don't
think
he
ever
got
to
it.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
he
found
the
statute
constitutional,
and
under
these
circumstances,
following
what
this
court
did
in
cameron
against
johnson,
it
really
wasn't
necessary.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
i
don't
believe
he
mentioned
that
at
all.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
--
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
from
a
judgment
of
a
three-judge
court
sitting
on
the
southern
district
of
new
york
denying
to
the
plaintiffs
an
injunction
and
declaratory
judgment
against
the
district
attorney
of
queens
county
and
the
attorney
general
for
the
state
of
new
york.
the
plaintiffs
seek
to
enjoin
their
prosecution
under
the
new
york
state
criminal
anarchy
statute.
the
eleven
defendants
and
five
others
--
the
eleven
plaintiffs,
excuse
me,
and
five
others
were
indicted
on
charges
of
(1)
advocacy
of
criminal
anarchy,
(2)
conspiracy
to
commit
advocacy
of
criminal
anarchy
and
in
the
case
of
one
of
the
plaintiffs
permitting
his
premises
to
be
used
for
assemblages
of
anarchists.
the
indictment
contained
altogether
48
counts
of
which
only
six
are
under
consideration
here.
the
other
42
counts
related
to
offenses
such
the
illegal
possession
of
guns
and
the
illegal
possession
of
explosives
and
weapons
and
the
conspiracy
to
commit
arsony
--
arson
and
the
--
a
whole
series
of
other
conventional
crimes.
we
are
concerned
here
and
we
attack
here
only
that
much
of
the
indictment
as
relates
to
the
new
york
criminal
anarchy
law.
now,
that
law
as
this
court
will
recall
was
passed
in
1902
and
was
applied
once
in
1921
in
the
gitlow
case.
was
not
used
again
until
1964
when
it
was
used
to
convict
mr.
epton.
the
indictment
was
handed
down
here
a
month
after
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
decision
in
epton.
and
it
raised
fears
in
the
minds
of
not
only
the
plaintiffs
but
many
others
who
are
entrusted
in
civil
liberties
issues
of
a
widespread
use
of
state
sedition
statutes
which
had
long
been
considered
nor
bound
but
which
had
effectively
stifled
radical
thought
in
the
20's
and
like
the
federal
act
in
the
50's.
in
addition
to
the
possession
of
guns
and
the
conspiracy
to
commit
arson
and
the
other
as
--
but
i
prefer
to
as
conventional
crimes,
two
of
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
were
charged
in
a
simultaneous
indictment
with
conspiracy
to
commit
murder.
they
were
convicted
in
that
case
as
pending
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari.
i
mention
this
merely
to
indicate
that
to
stress
the
point,
to
emphasize
the
point
that
there
on
the
books
of
new
york
of
course
many
statutes
including
those
that
are
charged
in
this
case
to
protect
public
order
and
to
take
care
of
people
who
collect
guns
in
order
to
seek
to
overthrow
the
government
or
for
any
other
purpose.
there
are
three
principal
points
raised
by
the
appellants
here.
the
first
is
that
the
new
york
criminal
anarchy
law
on
its
face
and
as
applied
in
this
case
violates
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments
of
the
constitution
both
with
respect
to
freedom
of
press,
speech
and
assembly
and
also
with
respect
to
due
process
of
law.
second,
that
the
new
york
statute
with
respect
to
the
selection
of
grand
jurors
has
a
monetary
or
had
at
that
time
a
monetary
qualification
before
he
serves
as
a
grand
juror
and
that
therefore
the
grand
jury
which
indicted
these
defendants
was
illegally
convened
and
finally
that
the
federal
government
through
the
smith
act
has
preempted
the
field
of
sedition
including
sedition
against
the
state.
i
shall
argue
only
the
first
of
these
points
here
today
and
i'm
not
abandoning
the
other
points.
i
think
they're
good.
or
we're
relying
on
them
but
they
have
been
briefed
and
i
know
that
those
issues
are
not
central
to
the
concern
of
the
court
here
today
and
i
shall
just
rely
on
my
brief.
we
are
limited
as
the
court,
this
of
course
with
the
--
by
time
limitations
and
i
would
prefer
to
use
that
time
to
address
myself
to
the
subject
which
i
know
concerns
the
court
most.
the
first
aspect,
however,
the
new
york
criminal
anarchy
law
and
its
unconstitutionality
is
of
course
a
critical
matter.
and
this
aspect
of
the
case
has
also
in
its
turn
i
think
three
aspects.
the
first
is
whether
section
1983
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1871
is
an
exception
to
2283
of
the
judicial
--
judiciary
code
and
i
think
that
that
issue
must
be
met
head
on.
the
second
is
assuming
that
we
can
meet
that
--
cross
that
threshold,
whether
the
court
should
nevertheless
abstain
and
i
think
that
issue
has
to
be
met
head
on.
and
finally,
we
get
i
hope
to
the
merits
of
the
case
namely
whether
the
act
on
its
face
and
as
applied
in
this
situation
is
unconstitutional.
now,
the
first
question
of
the
interrelation
of
1983
of
the
act
of
1871
and
the
section
2283
of
the
act
of
1789
i
guess
it
is,
is
a
matter
which
of
course
has
been
discussed
almost
endlessly.
it's
hard
to
think
of
any
question
within
the
general
area
of
procedural
rights
in
a
--
in
the
federal
--
with
respect
to
federal
jurisdiction
over
criminal
cases
that
has
caused
quite
as
much
judicial
and
law
review
discussion
in
the
last
two
or
three
years.
the
issue
was
faced
by
the
three-judge
court
in
cameron
against
jackson.
it
was
argued
in
brief
in
that
case
in
this
court
but
this
court
never
reached
the
problem
and
sent
it
back
to
the
district
court
for
decision
on
the
merits.
we
have
collected
the
cases
or
tried
to
collect
the
cases
that
are
not
completely
up-to-date
in
footnote
11,
page
24
of
our
brief
on
re-argument.
since
then
other
cases
have
been
called
to
our
attention
including
sheridan
against
garrison
and
machesky
against
bizzell
both
in
the
fifth
circuit.
there
have
been
extensive
law
review
articles
on
the
subject,
21
wrote
this
law
review,
an
unsigned
article
and
an
article
in
113
university
of
pennsylvania
law
review
signed
i
think
by
professor
amsterdam.
whatever
i
say
here
is
--
i
fear
going
to
be
an
echo
of
those
law
review
articles
and
those
court
decisions
which
have
decided
this
case
in
my
favor.
it
is
our
contention
that
section
1983
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1871
was
intended
by
congress
as
an
exception
to
2283
of
the
judiciary
code.
mr.
mackell
in
his
brief
points
out
that
2283
was
enacted
at
a
time
in
our
history
when
the
rights
of
the
states
were
of
primary
concern.
that
is
quite
true
but
1983
was
passed
at
a
time
in
our
history
when
congress
was
primarily
concerned
with
protecting
the
individual
from
injustices
which
they
feared
would
be
perpetrated
upon
them
by
the
state
courts
as
a
result
of
the
antagonisms,
the
tensions,
the
problems
that
had
arisen
out
of
the
civil
war.
it
was
passed
by
the
reconstruction
congresses
and
to
say
that
those
congresses
did
not
intend
to
interfere
with.
yes,
to
interfere
with
state
prosecution
in
certain
kinds
of
cases
runs
directly
contrary
to
the
legislative
history
of
that
statute.
it
has
been
argued
by
the
appellants
here,
by
the
appellees
here
and
by
persons
in
other
cases
that
our
interpretation
of
1983
will
impede
the
state
courts
in
the
normal
operation
of
the
criminal
laws.
it
will
and
that
is
exactly
what
was
intended
by
section
1983
of
the
civil
rights
law.
and
the
legislative
history
makes
it
clear,
not
in
all
cases
but
in
certain
kinds
of
cases,
cases
coming
within
section
1983
that
it
was
the
intent
of
congress
to
protect
persons
whose
rights
were
being
interfered
with
by
state
officials
including
state
courts
to
protect
them
by
giving
them
resort
to
a
federal
court.
and
i
cannot
see
how
it
is
possible
to
read
the
legislative
history
all
of
which
is
set
forth
in
the
watkins
law
review
article
at
a
considerable
length.
and
some
of
which
is
referred
to
also
by
professor
amsterdam
in
his
university
of
pennsylvania
law
review
article,
i
do
not
see
how
and
i
could
quote
professor
amsterdam,
“it
is
impossible
to
read
the
debates
without
concluding
that
the
federal
legislatures
were
intensely
aware
of
the
hostility
and
antiunion”
meaning,
northern
not
trade
union,
“prejudice
of
the
southern
state
courts
and
the
use
of
state
court
proceedings
to
harass
those
whom
the
union
had
an
obligation
to
protect.”
that
is
the
law
that
we
are
talking
about
today.
it's
section
1983
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1871.
and
to
say
that
congress
intended
that
a
person
who
is
being
improperly
prosecuted,
who
is
being
harassed,
whose
rights
are
being
taken
away
from
him
by
a
state
official
may
not
apply
to
a
federal
court
for
assistance
under
section
1983
is
to
fly
in
the
face
of
the
direct
intent
of
congress
in
passing
that
law.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
i
think
he
did
say
that
was
the
reason
for
the
removal
of
statute.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
well,
this
court
has
held
that
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
well,
it
may
be
that
they
were
giving
them
two
chances
to
get
into
the
federal
court,
yes.
i
think
that
congress
was
much
concerned
with
giving
as
much
protection
as
possible
to
the
persons
to
whom
--
whose
problems
it
was
addressing
itself
in
these
statutes.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
yes
sir,
i
think
that
would
be
true.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
if
it
had
removal,
it
would
just
involve
that
one
case.
if
he
had
injunction,
it
might
just
involve
that
one
case.
there
is
no
particular
reason
to
believe
that
every
injunction
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
that
is
true,
there
is
a
difference.
there
are
other
differences
also.
there
is
the
fact
for
example
that
under
the
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
that
is
true
but
this
kind
--
that
kind
of
case
would
be
available,
that
is
a
1983
case,
would
be
available
to
a
plaintiff
only
in
a
case
where
he
could
come
within
the
four
corners
of
the
act,
namely
that
his
constitutional
rights
were
being
interfered
with
by
state
officers
acting
under
color
of
law.
and
that
he
would
have
to
come
within
that
kind
of
a
case.
and
if
he
came
within
that
kind
of
a
case,
the
federal
--
the
congress
intended
to
give
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
well,
no,
obviously
every
act,
every
arrest
is
certainly
under
color
of
a
state
law.
but
the
statute
refers
to
a
person
who
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
who
is
denied
his
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
and
deprived
of
any
rights,
privileges,
or
immunity
secured
by
the
constitution
and
laws
of
the
united
states.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
and
it
is
in
that
kind
of
a
case
not
in
a
robbery
case,
not
in
a
blackmail
case
to
refer
to
some
of
the
situations
that
have
been
referred
to
here
in
this
morning.
but
only
in
the
case
where
a
person
has
been
deprived
of
his
rights
secured
by
the
constitution
and
laws
of
the
united
states.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
i
assume
that
in
order
to
secure
an
injunction
from
a
federal
court
you
would
have
to
show
more
than
a
mere
allegation.
you
would
have
to
present
the
situation
in
which
either
the
statute
involved
was
on
its
face
unconstitutional
because
it
deprived
the
petitioner
or
of
a
plaintiff
in
that
situation
of
rights,
privileges
and
immunity
secured
to
him
by
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
or
some
other
action
to
come
within
the
statute.
a
mere
allegation
that
i
am
being
arrested
for
blackmail
and
this
is
a
violation
of
my
constitutional
rights
is
not
sufficient
to
come
within
the
statute
and
i
assume
that
any
federal
district
court
confronted
by
this
problem
will
so
hold.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
if
that
is
what
happens
and
i
think
he
may
be
entitled
to
federal
protection.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
it
may
very
well
and
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
--
and
i
think
it
quite
possible
that
in
a
setting
of
1871,
it
may
be
that
many
offenses
would
normally
have
come
within
the
purview
of
congress
which
today
we
would
not
normally
think
as
coming
within
the
statute.
but
i
submit
that
that
it
seems
is
what
congress
intended
and
if
it's
too
broad
a
jurisdiction
then
the
remedy
is
a
remedy
to
congress.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
i
believe
that
this
court
has
held
that
--
i
don't
know
if
it's
this
court
or
other
federal
court,
have
held
that
that
is
not
within
seven
--
within
1983.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
well,
i
suppose
a
different
argument
could've
been
made.
we
are
not
confronted
with
that
case
but
i
think
that
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
well,
perhaps
it
would.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
it
--
perhaps
it
would,
perhaps
it
would.
it
doesn't
shock
me
your
honor.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
perhaps
it
would.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
perhaps
it
might
come
to
that
point.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
if
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
if
the
court
felt
that
it
was
prepared
to
extend
the
statute
to
cover
that
kind
of
situation,
now
it
may
very
well
be
and
as
i
say,
i
believe
that
the
courts
have
held
that
mere
matters
of
evidence
do
not
rise
to
the
height
required
by
the
statute.
we
are
not
concerned
in
our
case
with
a
mere
matter
of
evidence.
we
are
concerned
with
the
application
of
the
statute
which
i
submit
is
unconstitutional.
and
it
may
be
that
on
the
outer
reaches
of
the
problem,
there
will
be
questions
raised
but
we're
not
at
the
outer
reaches
at
the
moment.
we
are
right
at
the
center.
now
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
well,
the
circuits
have
not
only
divided
but
within
the
circuits,
there
have
been
divisions.
and
where
there
have
been
in
many
situations
where
there
have
been
decisions
as
for
example
in
the
fourth
circuit.
i
believe
the
fourth
circuit
has
held
that
1983
is
not
an
exception
to
2283
but
there
is
a
very
strong
dissent
by
chief
judge
sobeloff
in
--
i
think
its
baines
against
danville.
in
several
cases
in
the
fifth
circuit,
the
same
conclusion
is
reached
but
again
there
have
been
dissents
by
judges
reeves
and
wisdom
so
that
--
although
the
court
--
in
the
third
circuit
in
i
think
cooper
against
hutchison,
the
decision
is
the
other
way.
there
are
two
very
recent
fifth
circuit
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
it
held
that
20
--
1983
was
an
exception
to
2283.
there
are
two
recent
decisions
in
the
fifth
circuit.
one,
a
decision
by
judge
thornberry
and
the
other,
a
decision
by
judge
bell,
which
holds
that
section
1983
is
an
exception
to
2283;
both
of
them
unanimous
--
unanimous
decisions,
and
have
--
and
has
--
he
has
held
that
those
--
those
--
that
--
those
two
courts
have
held
that
2283
is
not
a
jurisdictional
statute
at
all.
but
the
2283
is
a
discretionary
statute
and
that
it
is
i
suppose
equivalent
to
the
co-question
of
abstention.
and
i
must
get
on
if
i
may
your
honors,
i
know
this
is
critical
to
the
dissent,
but
on
the
question
of
abstention
leaving
the
statute
aside
because
i
would
assume
that
the
general
rules
of
jeannette
against
--
douglas
against
jeannette
and
so
forth
might
cause
a
court
to
hold
that
it
is
going
to
abstain
even
if
it
has
jurisdiction
under
2283.
it
still
may
abstain
and
i
raise
the
question
as
to
whether
abstention
has
any
justification
at
all
in
this
case.
incidentally,
the
right
of
a
court
to
abstain
this,
mr.
justice
white
is
perhaps
the
answer
to
your
question
that
where
there
are
merely
matters
of
evidence
involved
that
the
federal
court
out
of
considerations
of
comity
and
all
of
the
considerations
in
douglas
against
jeannette
will
decide
that
it
will
abstain.
in
this
case,
there
is
no
reason
for
abstention
at
all.
we
know
as
a
matter
of
fact
because
it
has
decided
it
--
the
matter
in
the
epton
case
what
the
state
court
is
going
to
decide
with
respect
to
this
case.
we
know
what
its
interpretation
of
the
law
will
be.
there
is
no
reason
to
wait
to
find
out.
this
is
exactly
the
situation
in
the
allegheny
against
mashuda
case
except
that
the
complicating
circumstances
which
led
to
the
dissent
in
that
case
are
present
here.
this
is
the
situation
in
koota
against
zwickler.
this
is
a
situation
where
a
state
law
is
clear,
not
on
its
face,
of
course,
it's
very
unclear
on
its
face
but
it
is
clear
because
there
has
been
a
limiting
construction.
we
contend
a
limiting
construcion
and
unconstitutional
application.
it
has
given
that
limiting
instruction
and
unconstitutional
application
in
the
epton
case.
epton
in
effect
has
been
running
interference
for
us.
he
has
cleared
away
the
ambiguities
in
the
statute
and
there
is
no
reason
for
further
abstention
by
this
court
because
nothing
will
be
gained
by
abstention.
we
know
what
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
is
going
to
hold
and
what
it
is
going
to
hold
is
that
it
has
amended
the
gitlow
statute
so
that
it
now
has
a
limiting
construction.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
epton
was
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
yes,
certiorari
was
denied
because
there
was
an
independent
state
ground
for
the
decision.
there
had
been
concurrent
sentences
exactly
the
same
thing,
not
only
can
but
almost
certainly
will
happen
here
so
that
we
will
be
confronted
once
again
with
the
situation
where
this
court
may
not
accept
certiorari
because
there
is
an
independent
state
ground
for
the
sentence
and
we
will
be
faced
with
the
possibility
of
still
further
conspiracy,
criminal
anarchy
prosecutions
in
new
york
and
as
long
as
it
is
paired
with
the
conventional
state
crime,
we
can
never
a
juris
--
a
decision
from
this
court
as
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
state
sedition
law.
now,
my
time
is
about
up,
i
just
would
like
to
mention
one
thing
and
there
are
others
mentioned
in
the
brief
but
let
me
just
get
to
this
one
thing
because
i
think
it's
decisive
on
the
question
of
constitutionality
and
that
is
what
i
have
referred
to
as
the
amendment
of
the
gitlow
statute
by
the
state
court.
the
state
court
at
the
very
opening
of
its
decision
said,
“we
are
thus
presented
with
the
statute
which
is
unconstitutional
as
interpreted”,
and
they
then
go
ahead
to
reinterpret.
now,
the
difficulty
with
that
when
we
pointed
that
out
to
the
three-judge
court,
the
three-judge
court
said,
“oh,
well
this
is
a
matter
for
the
state
to
decide
if
they
want
to
give
their
court
of
appeals
the
right
to
amend
the
law,
that's
their
business.
it's
not
a
federal
question.”
but
it
is
a
federal
question
because
if
the
legislature
had
made
this
amendment,
we
would
have
an
ex
post
facto
situation
here.
what
--
because
the
court
amended
the
statute
we
have
to
ex
post
facto
situation
because
this
law
was
amended,
reinterpreted,
whatever
you
want
to
call
it,
by
the
state
legislature
after
the
acts
complained
of
in
this
indictment.
this
incidentally
is
the
subject
of
the
dissent,
the
very
strong
dissent
by
judge
burke
in
our
court
of
appeals
in
which
he
pointed
out
that
there
was
no
notice
to
the
defendant
that
this
statute
was
going
to
be
reinterpreted.
the
defendant
if
e
had
consulted
any
lawyer
in
new
york
would
have
told
and
there
was
no
valid
criminal
anarchy
law
in
new
york
because
gitlow
was
so
clearly
unconstitutional.
and
no
one
could
have
had
the
clairvoyance
to
have
seen
that
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
was
going
to
amend
the
law.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
i
think
not,
your
honor.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
no.
i
have
discussed
the
matter
in
my
brief
and
i
just
don't
have
the
time
to
discuss
it.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
may
it
please
the
court,
if
the
court
would
relieve
the
district
attorney
of
queens
of
the
stipulation
that
was
entered
in
too
long
ago
about
delaying
this
prosecution
pending
disposition
by
this
court,
we
will
immediately
prosecute
them
tomorrow
morning.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
like
the
others
on
the
calendar
this
week
was
here
for
the
third
time
and
like
the
other
cases,
it
involves
a
common
question
concerning
the
propriety
of
a
federal
injunction,
on
some
cases,
a
declaratory
judgment
against
a
pending
state
criminal
prosecution.
i
am
going
to
address
myself
initially
and
perhaps
exclusively
to
that
problem.
the
companion
problem
of
a
constitutionality
of
the
state
law
has
been
briefed,
it's
been
argued
twice
and
in
the
time
of
available
to
me,
i
may
not
get
to
it.
nor
will
i
restate
the
facts,
except
to
call
to
the
attention
of
the
court
two
things
--
two
items
which
i
think
are
of
considerable
importance.
in
the
first
place,
there
is
no
abstention
problem
at
all,
in
this
case.
the
state
court
in
the
epton
case
has
passed
upon
the
statute,
has
given
an
up-to-date
reading
of
the
statue
and
we
therefore
must
assume
that
the
state
court
will
apply
the
same
reading
to
this
case.
there
is
no
--
nothing
to
abstain
for.
we
have
already
gone
through
the
procedure
of
getting
a
state
court
interpretation
of
the
statute
and
i
do
not
understand
that
either
the
attorney
general
or
the
district
attorney
argues
that
we
should
abstain.
the
second
point
that
i
would
like
to
make
is
that
this
is
a
multi-count
indictment.
in
addition
to
several
counts
of
the
indictment,
which
are
under
attack
here,
there
are
a
large
other,
number
of
other
counts,
some
15
or
20
of
them
which
alleged
substantive
crimes
and
conspiracy
to
commit
substantive
crimes,
crimes
of
arson,
of
riot,
of
the
possession
of
guns,
of
the
possession
of
explosives,
conspiracy
to
commit
arson.
all
of
those
are
in
the
indictment
and
in
our
opinion
give
the
state
all
of
the
protection
that
it
needs.
on
each
of
the
previous
arguments,
a
question
has
been
raised
by
the
bench
as
to
why
these
cases
have
not
proceeded
in
view
of
the
fact
that
there
was
no
injunction
issued
by
the
three-judge
court.
and
it
has
been
explained
to
the
court
that
they
have
not
proceeded
because
an
assistant
district
attorney
entered
into
a
stipulation.
this
is
the
explanation
given
by
the
district
attorney.
an
assistant
district
attorney
entered
into
a
stipulation
in
which
he
agreed
that
he
would
not
proceed
with
the
prosecution
here
until
this
case
had
been
finally
determined
because
then,
no
one
thought
it
would
take
so
long
to
finally
determine
it.
i
would
like
to
point
and
i
might
say
that
ethics
on
the
part
of
the
district
attorney
to
relieve
itself
of
that
stipulation
have
thus
far
been
unsuccessful
although
he
has
made
efforts
in
the
federal
district
court.
i
might
say
that
that
stipulation
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
substantive
crimes
here.
if
the
district
attorney
had
wished
to
proceed
on
the
substantive
crimes,
they
could
have
been
tried
and
the
appeals
concluded
and
probably
the
sentence
is
served
if
they
had
been
found
guilty
before
we
had
gotten
to
this
point.
i
think
that
it
might
be
appropriate
to
just
say
a
few
words
of
history
here,
not
at
the
moment
the
history
of
1983,
but
the
history
of
the
power
of
the
federal
court
to
enjoin
state
criminal
proceedings.
that
is
not
an
invention
of
dombrowski.
for
75
years,
at
least
the
federal
courts
--
75
years
prior
to
dombrowski,
the
federal
courts
enjoined
the
threatened
enforcement
of
state
unconstitutional
laws.
this
was
not
a
doctrine
that
was
born
in
1965.
i
don't
know
when
it
started.
but
in
1897
in
smyth
against
ames,
the
united
states
district
court
enjoined
the
prosecution
of
a
state
criminal
law.
in
ex
parte
young1
of
course,
the
same
thing
happened.
in
truax
against
raich
in
1950,
chief
justice,
then
justice
hughes
said,
“while
the
court
of
equity
has
no
jurisdiction
--”
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
excuse
me.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
oh!
i
am
sorry.
“while
the
court
of
equity
generally
speaking
has
no
jurisdiction
over
the
prosecution
of
crimes
on
misdemeanors,
equitable
jurisdiction
exist
to
restrain
criminal
prosecutions
under
unconstitutional
enactments,
when
the
prevention
of
such
prosecutions
is
essential
to
the
safeguarding
of
the
rights
of
property
in
the
absence
of
inadequate
remedy
at
law.”
and
in
terrace
against
thompson
in
1923,
this
court
repeating
in
effect
that
language
when
on
to
say
that
the
plaintiff's
“are
not
obliged”
to
take
the
risk
of
prosecution,
fines
and
imprisonment
and
loss
of
property
in
order
to
secure
an
adjudication
of
their
rights.
then
came
douglas
against
jeannette,
i
suggest
that
douglas
against
jeannette
was
a
support
and
it
happened
primarily
because
on
the
same
day
as
we
all
know,
the
court
issued
--
this
court
issued
its
declaratory
judgment
in
the
murdock
case
holding
the
same
statute
unconstitutional
and
it
appeared
that
in
injunction
under
those
circumstances
would
be
unnecessary.
but
the
fact
was
that
as
of
douglas
against
jeannette,
we
find
this
court
giving
much
more
protection
to
property
rights
than
it
gave
to
first
amendment
rights
despite
the
contrary
history
of
this
court
through
the
famous
footnote
4
in
the
carolene
products
and
thomas
against
collins
and
that
whole
line
of
cases
still
consistently
applied
by
this
court
which
has
pointed
to
the
fragile
nature
of
first
amendment
rights,
which
has
pointed
to
the
fact
that
they
need
more
protection,
quicker
protection
than
property
rights
and
which
in
fact
has
given
that
protection.
except
that
somehow
in
this
area
between
douglas
and
jeannette
and
dombrowski,
this
rule
was
not
observed
in
this
specific
problem
of
securing
an
injunction.
then
dombrowski
came
along
and
i
submit,
it
put
douglas
against
jeannette
in
its
proper
place
and
i
am
not
now
referring
to
the
abstention
aspects
of
the
dombrowski
case
because
as
i
say
there
is
no
abstention
issues
in
this
case
but
i
am
referring
to
the
availability
of
injunctive
relief
to
stop
the
enforcement
of
a
state
criminal
prosecution.
in
the
period
prior
to
dombrowski
while
this
problem
of
an
injunction
remedy
was
being
worked
out,
a
parallel
development
in
terms
of
the
substantive
law
was
being
developed
which
culminated
in
baggett
against
bullitt
and
it
might
be
said
that
a
combination
of
the
old
doctrine
of
ex
parte
young
and
the
substantive
rule
of
baggett
against
bullitt
produced
the
dombrowski
decision.
and
as
i
read
dombrowski,
the
court
would
have
been
unanimous
on
this
case
and
that
there
is
no
abstention
problem
and
as
i
read
the
dissent
in
the
dombrowski
case,
it
is
based
exclusively
on
abstention.
the
dombrowski
rule
has
turned
out
to
be
a
very
powerful
weapon
in
protecting
civil
liberties
and
first
amendment
rights.
and
it
is
ever
so
much
more
important
now
and
has
been
for
the
past
15-20
years,
that
is
the
problem
of
first
--
protection
of
first
amendment
rights
much
more
important
than
it
ever
was
in
the
fifth
and
the
last
five
or
six
years
in
which
the
dombrowski
remedy
has
been
available.
the
technique,
the
remedial
device
provided
by
dombrowski
has
been
of
an
estimable
value
in
protecting
first
amendment
rights,
which
always
in
our
country
need
and
have
continued
and
will
probably
continue
to
need
full
protection.
the
issue
here
relates
to
the
application
of
the
doctrine,
i
think
the
doctrine
of
ex
parte
young
and
the
doctrine
of
dombrowski
to
pending
criminal
prosecutions
as
distinguished
from
criminal
prosecutions
that
are
not
pending
but
are
merely
threatened.
now
in
substantive
terms,
the
distinction
seems
quite
illogical.
the
injury
to
the
plaintiff
is
exactly
the
same.
the
interference
in
a
substantive
sense
with
state
processes
is
exactly
the
same.
it
is
often
impossible
for
an
individual
to
foresee
a
criminal
prosecution.
and
i
think
the
remarks
by
mr.
reed
in
the
case
that
was
just
argued
make
it
difficult
for
a
potential
defendant
who
has
not
yet
been
arrested
to
establish
standing
and
if
he
has
already
been
arrested,
he
is
faced
with
the
problem
that
we
are
all
faced
with
here
today.
last
week,
i
argued
a
case
in
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
second
circuit
in
which
i
argued
in
allege
violation
of
the
new
york
state
flag
statute.
i
argued
that
man
whose
neighbors
had
been
arrested
and
who
had
seen
the
rest
surround
him
on
all
sides
throughout
new
york
state
for
a
specific
violation
of
the
flag
statute
should
be
and
who
had
a
flag
like
that
and
wish
to
fly
it
should
be
entitled
to
an
injunction.
and
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
new
york
came
in
and
said,
“it's
too
early.
he
hasn't
been
arrested
yet.”
so
that
we
have
a
situation
in
which
either
you
are
too
early
or
too
late.
either
you
have
no
standing
or
you
are
barred
by
2283.
now
of
course
there
are
cases
where
as
a
result
of
some
sort
of
a
peculiar
procedure
of
situation
as
in
dombrowski
itself
that
happens
to
be
a
moment
in
between
the
threat
of
prosecution
and
the
actual
arrest.
but
that
does
not
happen
in
the
normal
case
and
it's
really
the
extraordinary
case
in
which
it
does
happen.
and
so
we
have
the
thing
that
all
of
us
don't
like,
namely
the
race
to
the
courthouse
door
to
see
who
can
get
in
there
first,
whether
we
can
come
before
the
state
prosecution
or
after
the
state
prosecution
and
it
seems
to
me
that
this
results
in
a
totally
unsatisfactory
situation.
thank
you.
[lunch
recess]
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
i
recalled
at
lunch
where
i
had
intended
to
say
in
connection
with
that
line
of
cases
of
smyth
against
ames
and
ex
parte
young
and
so
forth,
that
i
must
point
out
in
all
candid
that
in
some
of
those
cases
and
perhaps
all
of
them.
the
court
did
point
out
that
it
was
not
a
pending
proceeding
and
that
under
the
provisions
of
2283,
they
could
not
have
enjoined
a
pending
state
proceeding.
so
there
is
of
course
that
difference.
i
think
that
that
difference
does
not
apply
here
and
that
brings
us
to
the
next
point
on
why
not
extend
ex
parte
young
and
dombrowski
to
pending
criminal
cases.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
yes,
this
is
a
pending
proceeding.
oh!
yes.
it
presents
that
issue
very
squarely.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
well,
my
associate,
my
friend,
mr.
ludwig
will
tell
us
that.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
i
don't
of
course
know
what
the
evidence
was.
all
i
know
was
that
there
was
an
indictment.
i
wasn't
present
at
the
grand
jury
and
what
evidence
was
produced
before
the
grand
jury
i
don't
know
nor
except
anything
in
the
record.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
and
i
think
he
has
the
other
two
times.
i
suppose
he
will
this
time
also.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
oh!
there
was
a
great
deal
of
publicity
at
the
time.
yes.
now
when
we
get
to
the
question
of
the
extension
of
this
doctrine
to
pending
criminal
cases,
we're
confronted
of
course
with
this
question
of
2283.
i
might
say
that
the
district
court
in
this
case
jumped
right
over
the
threshold.
they
did
not
give
any
consideration
to
what
we
have
referred
to
at
the
threshold
problem
they
got
right
into
the
constitutionality
of
statute,
felt
that
the
statute
was
constitutional
and
thus
avoided
any
necessity
of
considering
this
problem
at
all.
2283
of
course
presents
a
problem
which
we
think
is
met
by
the
fact
that
we
argue
that
section
1983
of
the
civil
rights
law
of
1870
or
71
specifically
intended
to
provide
an
additional
exception
to
2283.
and
the
statute
itself
makes
no
distinction
between
pending
cases
and
cases
which
are
not
yet
pending
and
it
seems
hardly,
likely
that
the
congress
of
1871
was
tremendously
concerned
over
the
problem
of
the
federal
government
stepping
in
and
interfering
with
state
procedures.
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
legislative
history
of
that
act
which
has
been
discussed
in
a
number
of
law
review
articles
which
are
cited
in
my
brief
syracuse
law
review
and
pennsylvania
law
review
and
elsewhere.
i
can't
go
into
it
now.
of
course,
it
seems
to
us
makes
it
clear
that
what
congress
was
addressing
itself
to
is
the
very
specific
problem
of
abuses
by
state
court
as
well
as
by
other
state
agencies
and
the
suggestion
that
congress
intended
to
permit
injunctions
to
be
applied
before
state
prosecution
occurs
rather
than
after
state
prosecution
occurs.
there
is
certainly
no
way
as
suggested
in
the
legislative
history
at
all.
and
i
would
like
to
point
out
and
mr.
justice
marshall
mentioned
this
at
the
last
document
that
in
the
series
of
laws
that
were
passed
after
the
civil
war,
congress
provided
for
another
example
of
stepping
in
and
gave
the
federal
courts
an
opportunity
to
step
into
a
state
court
proceeding
right
in
the
middle
of
a
trial,
not
merely
after
an
indictment
but
right
in
the
middle
of
a
trial
in
the
removal
situation
and
gave
the
federal
courts
under
some
circumstances
which
may
be
limited
but
nevertheless,
they
do
exist.
circumstances
in
which
state
court
could
--
federal
court
could
come
in
or
at
least
a
defendant
in
the
criminal
case
could
remove
to
the
federal
court
thus
stopping
a
criminal
trial
right
smack
in
the
middle
of
it,
a
position
that
we
don't
have
to
go
through
so
far
as
this
case
is
concerned.
now,
of
course
as
i
say
i
cannot
at
this
time
and
there'd
be
no
point
in
oral
argument
anyhow
in
reviewing
the
legislative
history
of
the
acts
of
1870
and
1871.
there
is
an
article
by
professor
amsterdam
in
the
university
of
pennsylvania
law
review,
one
in
the
syracuse
law
review
and
perhaps
others
which
do
discus
the
congressional
debates
at
considerable
length
and
come
to
the
conclusion
that
1983
was
intended
to
provide
and
to
carve
out
another
exception
to
2283.
so
we
believe
and
all
i
can
do
refer
to
that
legislative
history
that
there
is
no
bar
in
2283
to
the
relief
that
we
are
requesting
here.
i
would
be
blind
and
i
suppose
deaf
also
if
i
did
--
were
not
aware
of
the
fact
that
there
is
a
grave
concern
that
the
position
which
i
am
advocating
here
might
lend
itself
to
a
great
deal
of
abuse.
that
at
the
drop
of
a
hat,
defendants
in
either
anticipated
or
pending
criminal
court
cases
will
go
plunging
into
the
federal
courts
at
the
drop
of
a
hat
and
will
seek
and
secure
injunctions
which
will
tie
up
state
court
proceedings.
i
suppose
that
any
doctrine
that
any
court
can
apply
under
some
circumstances
is
subject
to
what
might
be
called
abuse.
lawyers
representing
defendants
are
ingenious,
they
are
imaginative,
many
of
them
and
they
do
think
up
or
try
to
think
up
devices
to
protect
their
clients
as
vigorously
and
as
well
as
they
can
and
i
have
no
doubt
that
any
kind
of
a
procedural
device
will
give
rise
to
certain
cases
where
some
people
will
say
that
the
procedural
devices
are
being
abused
and
i
think
that
is
what
the
courts
are
for.
the
courts
are
there
to
prevent
such
abuse
if
it
be
an
abuse
from
taking
place.
and
i
am
not
--
well
i
was
going
to
say,
i'm
not
very
much
concerned
but
it
isn't
my
job
to
be
concerned.
i
don't
--
i
suggest
that
courts
need
not
be
excessively
concerned
over
this
problem.
by
hypothesis,
these
cases
come
before
three-judge
courts
and
as
was
pointed
out
by
i
think
mr.
reed
in
the
argument
before,
the
three-judge
court
includes
a
court
of
the
--
judge
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
possibility
that
injunctions
will
be
scattered
far
and
wide
on
trivial
pretext,
i
think
is
a
relatively
minor
one.
furthermore,
i
do
think
that
much
of
the
problem
can
be
solved
by
a
proper
hammering
out
or
proper
abstention
rules
which
will
see
to
it
that
lawyers
do
not
come
into
the
federal
courts
prematurely
and
that
the
possibility
of
flooding
the
federal
criminal
courts
every
time
somebody
is
arrested
for
disorderly
conduct
charged
under
statute
that
somebody
claims
is
unconstitutional.
again,
it
can
be
prevented
by
as
i
say
proper
abstention
rules
and
proper
use
of
discretion
by
the
three-judge
court.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
no,
i
do
not.
i
have
heard
that
there
has
been
a
substantial
increase
though.
i
really
don't
know
what
the
statistics
are.
i
do
know
the
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
i'm
sure
would
have
that
and
i
really
don't
know
whether
there
has
been
an
increase
or
what
the
increase
has
been.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
well
as
i
say,
i
have
the
impression
that
there
has
been
an
increase
in
the
number
of
three
judge
courts
and
how
many
of
them
are
attributable
to
this
kind
of
case,
i
also
don't
know
and
i
have
never
made
such
an
analysis
and
i
don't
know
what
the
answer
to
that
is.
as
i
say,
i
think
that
there
are
ways
of
handling
that
other
than
by
throwing
out
the
baby
and
that
the
rule
of
the
dombrowski
case
judiciously
applied
to
pending
criminal
cases
would
have
a
great
--
a
statutory
effect
in
the
protection
of
first
amendment
rights.
i
am
not
suggesting
that
this
be
extended
to
all
kinds
of
cases
and
i
don't
think
anybody
has
suggested
that,
but
we
do
have
and
have
always
recognized
an
exception
in
the
area
of
first
amendment
rights
and
i
do
think
that
the
retreat
and
i
would
call
it
a
retreat
in
this
situation
would
be
disadvantageous
to
a
protection
of
those
rights.
i
might
point
out
that
their
relegation
the
plaintiffs
to
the
state
court
of
remedies
in
this
case
would
really
be
serious
because
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
well,
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
well,
that
maybe
true.
perhaps,
let
me
say
it
that
shutting
off
the
remedy
that
we
are
appealing
for
or
applying
for
in
this
situation
may
very
well
mean
that
there
will
never
be
an
adjudication
of
the
new
york
state
criminal
anarchy
statute
for
the
reason
that
i
know
the
court
is
familiar
with
and
that
your
honor
discussed
in
the
epton
cases
because
there
are
along
series
of
substantive
crimes.
and
if
the
defendant's
are
to
be
--
will
be
found
guilty
of
any
of
the
substantive
crimes
and
they
may
be,
then
we
may
be
confronted
this
time
and
the
next
time
and
the
next
time
and
the
next
time
with
repetitions
of
the
epton
situation
in
which
this
court
refuses
to
grant
certiorari
because
there
is
an
independent
state
ground
justifying
the
sentence
with
the
result
that
the
statute
may
remain
on
the
books
as
an
in
terrorem
device
for
a
long
period
of
time
and
that
seems
to
us
partly
unjustified
given
the
nature
of
the
statute
and
if
as
we
contend
the
statute
is
unconstitutional.
and
i
might
say
that
it
is
rather
difficult
for
me
to
imagine
how
a
plaintiff
could
come
into
court
and
seek
relief
under
this
statute
prior
to
indictment.
it
seems
to
me
and
would
be
in
the
most
unusual
situation
if
a
plaintiff
came
in
and
said,
“i
am
intending
to
engage
in
conduct
which
may
violate
the
state
criminal
anarchy
law
and
i
want
an
adjudication
of
which
will
violate
the
state
from
criminal
anarchy
law
and
i
want
an
adjudication
because
the
law
is
unconstitutional.”
i
would
say
that
that
remedy
which
is
open
and
perhaps
some
kind
of
situations
would
not
be
open
to
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
this
is
in
appeal
from
a
judgment
of
the
three-judge
statutory
court
sitting
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york
denying
two
plaintiffs
an
injunction
and
declaratory
judgment
against
the
district
attorney
of
queens
county.
the
plaintiffs
sought
an
injunction
and
declaratory
judgment
to
enjoin
their
prosecution
under
the
new
york
criminal
anarchy
statute.
the
facts,
the
relevant
facts
i
think
can
be
very
briefly
stated.
on
june
21,
1967,
the
11
plaintiffs
here
were
indicted
together
with
a
number
of
others,
on
charges
of
advocacy
of
criminal
anarchy
conspiracy
to
commit
the
crime
of
advocacy
of
criminal
anarchy.
two
of
them
were
also
charged
with
permitting
there
premises
to
be
used
for
an
assemblage
of
anarchists.
the
indictment
was
considerably
broader
than
this
in
that
it
had
48
counts
of
which
only
five
come
--
five
are
before
the
court
on
this
application.
the
other
43
counts
all
related
to
specific
crimes,
most
of
them
to
the
possession
of
guns.
contrary
to
the
law
of
the
state
of
new
york,
i
think
there's
also
a
charge
one
of
the
counts
relates
to
a
conspiracy
to
commit
the
crime
of
arson.
this
case,
the
indictment
here
invoked
the
new
york
criminal
anarchy
statute
of
1902,
which
was
first
applied
in
the
period
after
the
first
world
war
of
the
early
20's
in
the
gitlow
case.
and
was
not
applied
again
until
1964
when
it
was
applied
by
new
york
state
in
the
case
of
people
against
epton.
this
resurrection
of
a
moribund
statute
in
the
epton
case
and
the
mass
indictment
in
this
case
which
followed
36
days
after,
the
court
of
appeals
decision
in
epton
poses
a
threat,
we
think,
to
the
radical
political
activity
of
our
time
and
raises
memories
of
the
20's
and
the
prosecutions
of
those
errors
which
clearly
seem
to
us
to
be
inconsistent
with
modern
constitutional
doctrine.
the
plaintiffs
brought
this
action
and
rely
largely
on
the
general
authority
of
this
court
in
cases
such
as
dombrowski
and
cases
which
have
followed
it,
and
so
far
as
declaratory
judgment
is
concerned,
in
zwickler
against
koota.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
no,
sir.
we
argue,
of
course
we'll
come
to
that
in
a
moment,
it's
a
major
part
of
this
case.
the
--
we
argue
that
the
statute
both
on
its
face
and
as
construed
in
gitlow
is
both
vague
and
overbroad
and
it
is
clearly
unconstitutional,
and
i
don't
think
there's
any
argument
about
that.
the
court
of
appeals
of
new
york
held
as
this
court
has
held
on
a
number
of
occasions
that
the
gitlow
case
is
no
longer
law.
in
keyishian
in
this
court
discussed
this
very
statute
at
some
length
and
held
that
it
was
clearly
unconstitutional.
however,
the
defendant
argues
that
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
in
epton,
by
means
of
narrowing
construction
corrected
the
defect.
and
this
view
was
accepted
by
the
three-judge
court.
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
in
its
opinion
narrowing
the
construction
said
that,
“well,
we
think
now
that
the
legislative
intent
of
1902
was
to
write
a
constitutional
statute.”
and
of
course
the
constitutional
doctrine
has
changed
a
good
deal
since
that
time,
and
so
we
will
now
say
that
the
legislature
in
1902
intended
to
conform
to
existing
constitutional
standards.
and
the
three-judge
court
echoed
this
somewhat
ever
epigrammatically
saying,
“if
the
1902
legislature
had
known
it
could
not
have
all
it
wanted,
it
would
have
wanted
all
it
could
have.”
and
on
the
basis
of
this,
it
held
the
construction,
the
narrowing
construction
of
the
gitlow
statute
constitutional.
now,
there
are
two
primary
questions
raised
on
this
face
of
the
case.
the
first
is
whether
that
narrowing
construction
in
epton
is
binding
on
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
at
all.
the
overt
acts
charged
in
this
indictment
all
took
place
before
the
narrowing
construction.
as
i
say
the
indictment
here
was
only
36
days
after
the
decision
of
the
court
in
the
epton
case.
so
that
none
of
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
had
any
notice
at
all
of
the
narrowing
construction
that
the
court
of
appeals
of
new
york
was
going
to,
which
obviously
i
couldn't
tell,
which
later
the
court
of
appeals
of
new
york
was
going
to
read
it
to
the
statute.
and
we
submit
that
the
plaintiffs
can
no
more
be
charged
with
clairvoyance.
if
i
may
echo
what
this
court
suggest
a
couple
of
weeks
ago
in
shuttlesworth,
can
no
more
be
charged
with
clairvoyance
as
to
the
plastic
surgery
that
the
court
of
appeals
were
deployed
to
the
gitlow
statute
then
shuttlesworth
could
be
charged
with
knowing
what
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
was
ultimately
going
to
decide
in
the
ordinance
under
consideration
in
that
case.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
does
your
honor
mean
the
question
of
the
injunction,
the
propriety
of
an
injunction,
the
cameron
against
johnson
problem?
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
well,
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
yes,
sir.
now,
i
certainly
shall,
your
honor.
now,
we
--
we
feel
that
the,
as
i
say
the
act
--
overt
act
here
were
charged
after
were
--
the
narrowing
construction
was
not
the
law
of
the
state
of
new
york,
assuming
that
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
had
the
right
to
do
this
at
all.
it
certainly
was
not
the
law
of
the
state
of
new
york
but
till
after
the
epton
decision
and
we
do
not
believe
that
the
narrowing
construction
or
that
the
defendants
can
be
held
or
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
can
be
held
liable
for
that.
furthermore,
even
in
the
epton
case
the
court
of
appeals
reconstrued
only
subdivision
1
of
the
criminal
anarchy
law
left
subdivision
3
and
4
untouched
so
that
--
as
to
those
statutes,
those
sections
of
the
statutes
were
true
--
which
are
specifically
alleged
in
the
indictment
in
this
case
were
not
construed
at
all.
now,
i
submit
that
the
doctrine
that
a
statute
which
is
clearly
unconstitutional
and
which
everyone
admits
is
unconstitutional
can
be
reconstrued
by
a
court
--
by
the
highest
court
of
the
state
is
really
a
most
dangerous
doctrine.
it
means
that
any
state
can
always
resurrect
the
statute
which
has
been
declared
unconstitutional
by
this
court,
and
without
any
notice
to
the
persons
within
the
state
make
a
silent
statute,
an
invisible
statute,
a
dead
statute
again
come
to
life.
this
is
much
more
extreme
than
the
situation
in
shuttlesworth
because
in
that
case
the
unconstitutional
doctrine
was
--
the
unconstitutional
interpretation
was
pronounced
by
the
commissioner
of
public
safety,
and
mr.
justice
harlan
pointed
out
that
that
was
not
too
reliable
an
interpretation.
here
we
have
an
interpretation
by
the
court
of
appeals.
an
interpretation
which
is
clearly
unconstitutional
in
gitlow
and
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
in
the
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
it
was
upheld
in
gitlow.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
well,
i
think
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
well,
your
honor
let
me
--
when
i
say
everybody
has
agreed
that
may
not
be
true.
this
court
in
keyishian
said
it
was
unconstitutional.
the
new
york
court
said
the
gitlow
statute
as
interpreted
in
gitlow
as
read
by
gitlow
with
the
gitlow
gloss
on
the
statute
was
an
improper
unconstitutional
statute.
this
court
said
so
in
keyishian.
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
said
so
in
epton.
the
queens
county
court
said
so
in
this
case.
so
everyone
agrees.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
no,
because
i
think
that
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
in
the
keyishian
case
said
that
the
gitlow
--
that
discussed
this
specific
statute.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
yes,
sir.
discussed
the
statute
that
was
before
the
court
in
the
gitlow
case
and
said
that
it
was
an
--
it
said
in
rather
strong
language
i
think.
it
said
that
this
statute
is
clearly
impermissible
under
current
constitutional
standards
and
it
discussed
subdivision
3
which
is
one
of
the
sections
here
and
said
that
under
the
statute
as
interpreted
by
gitlow,
a
man
walking
down
a
campus
with
a
copy
of
karl
marx's
doctrine
in
his
hand
might
be
violating
the
law.
i
believe
that
was
the
example
used
by
the
court
in
the
keyishian
case.
so
it
will
not
be
argued
here
today
that
the
gitlow
interpretation
is
any
longer
a
valid
interpretation
under
the
doctrine,
even
if
dennis
for
that
matter
because
even
dennis
in
that
opinion
suggested
that
the
gitlow
case
was
really
doubtful,
and
that
in
many
standards
inconsistent
with,
as
i
say
a
larger
range
of
cases,
the
scales
case,
the
(inaudible)
case,
and
the
whole
range
of
constitutional
decisions
in
the
last
10
years
of
this
court.
so
that
i
think
that
the
situation
is
very
similar
to
the
shuttlesworth
case.
there,
there
was
and
i'm
paraphrasing
the
decision
of
the
court,
but
i
think
it's
the
same
paraphrase
that
mr.
justice
harlan
used.
this
court
held
that
where
a
statute
is
interpreted
in
an
unconstitutional
fashion
by
the
commissioner
of
public
safety
that
mr.
shuttlesworth
had
the
right
to
treat
that
statute
as
void
and
could
not
be
charged
with
clairvoyance
that
the
court
would
later
hold
that
the
commissioner
of
public
safety
was
wrong.
now
here,
we
have
not
the
chief
of
police
holding
--
giving
the
statute
an
unconstitutional
interpretation,
but
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
giving
what
is
today
an
unconstitutional
interpretation.
although,
obviously,
at
the
time
of
the
gitlow
decision
that
ipso
facto
was
unconstitutional
interpretation
because
the
court
so
said
so.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
i
know
you
did
write
it,
your
honor.
and
if
that's
the
way
you
interpreted
it,
i
--
obviously
that's
what
it
must
mean.
i
--
the
language
is
it
would
have
taken
extraordinary
clairvoyance
for
anyone
to
perceive
that
this
language
meant
what
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
was
destined
to
find
that
it
meant
four
years
later.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
and
i
misread
it
if
that's
what
your
honor
meant.
now,
we
feel
that
the
epton
laws
on
the
statute
still
leaves
it
unconstitutional,
and
this
comes
to
your
honor's
and
mr.
justice
harlan's
question.
there
is
still
no
clear
guidance
as
to
what
may
or
may
not
be
done
under
the
statute.
and
one
of
the
most
serious
defects
in
the
court
of
appeals
interpretation
in
the
epton
case
relates
to
the
clear
and
present
danger
or
rather
unsatisfactory
test
under
the
best
of
circumstances.
but
at
least
in
the
dennis
case,
in
applying
the
clear
and
present
danger
test,
the
court
clearly
said
that
there
must
be
a
clear
and
present
danger
of
an
overthrow
of
the
government
of
the
united
states.
in
the
epton
case,
the
court
found
it
quite
sufficient
that
there
was
a
finding
of
clear
and
present
danger
to
commit
a
riot.
now,
if
the
all
that
the
clear
and
present
danger
test
means
in
the
eyes
of
the
new
york
court
of
appeals,
and
if
that
is
the
cause
placed
on
the
statute
now,
is
that
the
crime
of
sedition
requires
only
that
there
be
a
clear
and
present
danger
of
this
order
which
is
a
far
cry
from
the
overthrow
of
the
government
of
the
united
states,
or
even
the
overthrow
of
the
government
of
new
york,
then
i
submit
that
we
still
have
a
statute
that
is
unconstitutional
even
under
the
epton
decision.
now,
in
dombrowski,
this
court
held
that
it
will
not
abstain
in
a
case
such
as
this
--
such
as
was
presented
in
dombrowski,
where
the
policy
reasons
were
operated
against
in
one
of
the
elements
in
the
policy
considerations,
or
among
the
elements
in
the
policy
considerations
in
dombrowski,
which
motivated
the
court
in
deciding
against
the
doctrine
of
abstention,
was
that
this
was
a
first
amendment
situation.
that
it
did
involve
a
statute
which
to
refer
again
to
those
words
which
have
perhaps
been
a
little
overused,
it
did
have
a
chilling
effect
on
those
who,
i
can't
help
it
mr.
justice
stewart,
everybody
says
that.
it
did
have
a
chilling
effect
on
the
operation
of
people
who
are
engaged
in
political
activity
and
that
the
statute
was
of
such
a
nature
that
it
would
require
repeated
applications.
that
the
exact
meaning
of
the
statute
would
have
to
be
hammered
out
in
repeated
prosecutions
over
a
long
period
of
time
in
the
state
courts
if
the
doctrine
of
abstention
was
followed.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
well
has
authority
to
issue
--
to
consider
the
application
for
an
injunction
under
dombrowski
and
i
would
say
mrs.
piel
will
argue
this
a
little
more
fully
of
a
declaratory
judgment
if
(voice
overlap).
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
oh!
no,
sir,
i
would
say
you
also
have
to
show
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
i
think
that
that's
probably
a
broader
reading
of
dombrowski
then.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
well,
i
would
say
that
where
the
state
is
prosecuting,
and
i
may
be
getting
back
to
the
same
point,
your
honor,
let
me
try
to
spell
it
out.
where
the
state
is
prosecuting
in
a
first
amendment
area,
and
where
the
circumstances
are
such
as
to
cast
a
poll
inhibit
the
free
exercise
of
first
amendment
rights
guaranteed
by
the
first
amendment
and
the
fourteenth
that
in
that
kind
of
a
situation,
the
federal
court
has
jurisdiction
to
determine
whether
the
statute
is
a
constitutional
statute
and
whether
it
should
under
all
of
the
standards
that
are
set
forth
under
one
hand
in
dombrowski,
on
the
other
hand
in
douglas
against
jeannette
whether
it
should
or
should
not
abstain.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
well,
i'm
not
sure
for
example
that
an
obscenity
case
would
fall
within
that
category.
i
don't
believe
that
the
chilling
effect
of
a
vague
obscenity
statute
would
be
the
kind
of
thing
that
would
cast
a
poll
on
political
activity
within
the
meaning
of
the
dombrowski
case.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
i
would
say
it
has
to
be
--
it
has
to
be
certainly
first
amendment
activity.
and
i
would
say
when
we're
--
considering
that
we're
talking
about
casting
a
poll
on
the
carrying
on
of
activities,
i
would
say
it
probably
has
to
be
political
activity.
at
least
i
would
have
difficulty
in
extending
it
to
an
obscenity
case.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
i
would
say
it
is
less
serious
in
terms
of
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
--
the
eminence
of
the
importance
of
political
activity,
yes,
sir.
i
don't
think
it
matters
a
great
deal
that
it
may
be
my
personal
view
on
the
matter.
i
don't
think
it
matters
a
great
deal
if
you
have
to
wait
a
couple
of
years
to
find
out
whether
you
can
show
a
movie
or
publish
a
book.
i
do
think
it
matters
a
great
deal
to
wait
a
few
years
to
find
out
whether
you
can
join
an
organization
or
distribute
a
leaflet.
to
engage
in
a
political
campaign
and
do
the
other
--
carry
on
the
other
activities
similar
in
nature.
now,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
in
this
situation,
the
state
was
amply
protected
by
other
laws.
that
is
thereof,
as
i
say
43
counts
and
incidentally,
two
of
the
defendants
were
charged
and
still
since
been
convicted
of
the
crime
of
conspiracy
to
murder.
so
that
the
state
has
weapons
at
its
disposal;
the
gun
statutes,
the
arson
statutes,
the
murder
statutes
and
all
these
other
things
to
take
care
of
a
situation
such
as
this
and
there
doesn't
seem
to
be
any
requirement
in
order
to
protect
the
interest
of
the
state,
while
it
must
impose
on
top
of
this
a
sedition
statute
phrased
in
the
very
broad
and
general
terms
of
the
new
york
statute.
now,
there
are
other
points
which
i
think
i'll
set
forth
in
the
brief,
and
i'm
sharing
my
time
here
with
counsel
in
the
consolidated
case.
there
is
of
course
the
supersession
point
discussed
in
the
nelson
which
is
i
think
adequately
brief
than
which
is
involved
in
the
next
case
harris
against
younger
as
well
as
in
this
one.
and
finally
there
is
the
argument
or
the
problem
of
the
effect
of
section
42
u.s.
code
1983
on
28
u.s.
code
2283,
that
is
the
question
of
whether
the
civil
rights
act
is
an
exception
to
the
provision
of
the
judiciary
code
with
respect
to
granting
injunctions.
that
issue
has
been
before
this
court.
it's
been
argued
by
this
court
so
many
times
that
i
really
don't
think
it
necessary
to
do
it
again.
it
was
presented
in
cameron
against
johnson.
i
think
it's
adequately
brief
that
i
rest
on
that.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
no,
i
don't
think
he
ever
got
to
it.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
he
found
the
statute
constitutional,
and
under
these
circumstances,
following
what
this
court
did
in
cameron
against
johnson,
it
really
wasn't
necessary.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
i
don't
believe
he
mentioned
that
at
all.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
--
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
from
a
judgment
of
a
three-judge
court
sitting
on
the
southern
district
of
new
york
denying
to
the
plaintiffs
an
injunction
and
declaratory
judgment
against
the
district
attorney
of
queens
county
and
the
attorney
general
for
the
state
of
new
york.
the
plaintiffs
seek
to
enjoin
their
prosecution
under
the
new
york
state
criminal
anarchy
statute.
the
eleven
defendants
and
five
others
--
the
eleven
plaintiffs,
excuse
me,
and
five
others
were
indicted
on
charges
of
(1)
advocacy
of
criminal
anarchy,
(2)
conspiracy
to
commit
advocacy
of
criminal
anarchy
and
in
the
case
of
one
of
the
plaintiffs
permitting
his
premises
to
be
used
for
assemblages
of
anarchists.
the
indictment
contained
altogether
48
counts
of
which
only
six
are
under
consideration
here.
the
other
42
counts
related
to
offenses
such
the
illegal
possession
of
guns
and
the
illegal
possession
of
explosives
and
weapons
and
the
conspiracy
to
commit
arsony
--
arson
and
the
--
a
whole
series
of
other
conventional
crimes.
we
are
concerned
here
and
we
attack
here
only
that
much
of
the
indictment
as
relates
to
the
new
york
criminal
anarchy
law.
now,
that
law
as
this
court
will
recall
was
passed
in
1902
and
was
applied
once
in
1921
in
the
gitlow
case.
was
not
used
again
until
1964
when
it
was
used
to
convict
mr.
epton.
the
indictment
was
handed
down
here
a
month
after
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
decision
in
epton.
and
it
raised
fears
in
the
minds
of
not
only
the
plaintiffs
but
many
others
who
are
entrusted
in
civil
liberties
issues
of
a
widespread
use
of
state
sedition
statutes
which
had
long
been
considered
nor
bound
but
which
had
effectively
stifled
radical
thought
in
the
20's
and
like
the
federal
act
in
the
50's.
in
addition
to
the
possession
of
guns
and
the
conspiracy
to
commit
arson
and
the
other
as
--
but
i
prefer
to
as
conventional
crimes,
two
of
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
were
charged
in
a
simultaneous
indictment
with
conspiracy
to
commit
murder.
they
were
convicted
in
that
case
as
pending
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari.
i
mention
this
merely
to
indicate
that
to
stress
the
point,
to
emphasize
the
point
that
there
on
the
books
of
new
york
of
course
many
statutes
including
those
that
are
charged
in
this
case
to
protect
public
order
and
to
take
care
of
people
who
collect
guns
in
order
to
seek
to
overthrow
the
government
or
for
any
other
purpose.
there
are
three
principal
points
raised
by
the
appellants
here.
the
first
is
that
the
new
york
criminal
anarchy
law
on
its
face
and
as
applied
in
this
case
violates
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments
of
the
constitution
both
with
respect
to
freedom
of
press,
speech
and
assembly
and
also
with
respect
to
due
process
of
law.
second,
that
the
new
york
statute
with
respect
to
the
selection
of
grand
jurors
has
a
monetary
or
had
at
that
time
a
monetary
qualification
before
he
serves
as
a
grand
juror
and
that
therefore
the
grand
jury
which
indicted
these
defendants
was
illegally
convened
and
finally
that
the
federal
government
through
the
smith
act
has
preempted
the
field
of
sedition
including
sedition
against
the
state.
i
shall
argue
only
the
first
of
these
points
here
today
and
i'm
not
abandoning
the
other
points.
i
think
they're
good.
or
we're
relying
on
them
but
they
have
been
briefed
and
i
know
that
those
issues
are
not
central
to
the
concern
of
the
court
here
today
and
i
shall
just
rely
on
my
brief.
we
are
limited
as
the
court,
this
of
course
with
the
--
by
time
limitations
and
i
would
prefer
to
use
that
time
to
address
myself
to
the
subject
which
i
know
concerns
the
court
most.
the
first
aspect,
however,
the
new
york
criminal
anarchy
law
and
its
unconstitutionality
is
of
course
a
critical
matter.
and
this
aspect
of
the
case
has
also
in
its
turn
i
think
three
aspects.
the
first
is
whether
section
1983
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1871
is
an
exception
to
2283
of
the
judicial
--
judiciary
code
and
i
think
that
that
issue
must
be
met
head
on.
the
second
is
assuming
that
we
can
meet
that
--
cross
that
threshold,
whether
the
court
should
nevertheless
abstain
and
i
think
that
issue
has
to
be
met
head
on.
and
finally,
we
get
i
hope
to
the
merits
of
the
case
namely
whether
the
act
on
its
face
and
as
applied
in
this
situation
is
unconstitutional.
now,
the
first
question
of
the
interrelation
of
1983
of
the
act
of
1871
and
the
section
2283
of
the
act
of
1789
i
guess
it
is,
is
a
matter
which
of
course
has
been
discussed
almost
endlessly.
it's
hard
to
think
of
any
question
within
the
general
area
of
procedural
rights
in
a
--
in
the
federal
--
with
respect
to
federal
jurisdiction
over
criminal
cases
that
has
caused
quite
as
much
judicial
and
law
review
discussion
in
the
last
two
or
three
years.
the
issue
was
faced
by
the
three-judge
court
in
cameron
against
jackson.
it
was
argued
in
brief
in
that
case
in
this
court
but
this
court
never
reached
the
problem
and
sent
it
back
to
the
district
court
for
decision
on
the
merits.
we
have
collected
the
cases
or
tried
to
collect
the
cases
that
are
not
completely
up-to-date
in
footnote
11,
page
24
of
our
brief
on
re-argument.
since
then
other
cases
have
been
called
to
our
attention
including
sheridan
against
garrison
and
machesky
against
bizzell
both
in
the
fifth
circuit.
there
have
been
extensive
law
review
articles
on
the
subject,
21
wrote
this
law
review,
an
unsigned
article
and
an
article
in
113
university
of
pennsylvania
law
review
signed
i
think
by
professor
amsterdam.
whatever
i
say
here
is
--
i
fear
going
to
be
an
echo
of
those
law
review
articles
and
those
court
decisions
which
have
decided
this
case
in
my
favor.
it
is
our
contention
that
section
1983
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1871
was
intended
by
congress
as
an
exception
to
2283
of
the
judiciary
code.
mr.
mackell
in
his
brief
points
out
that
2283
was
enacted
at
a
time
in
our
history
when
the
rights
of
the
states
were
of
primary
concern.
that
is
quite
true
but
1983
was
passed
at
a
time
in
our
history
when
congress
was
primarily
concerned
with
protecting
the
individual
from
injustices
which
they
feared
would
be
perpetrated
upon
them
by
the
state
courts
as
a
result
of
the
antagonisms,
the
tensions,
the
problems
that
had
arisen
out
of
the
civil
war.
it
was
passed
by
the
reconstruction
congresses
and
to
say
that
those
congresses
did
not
intend
to
interfere
with.
yes,
to
interfere
with
state
prosecution
in
certain
kinds
of
cases
runs
directly
contrary
to
the
legislative
history
of
that
statute.
it
has
been
argued
by
the
appellants
here,
by
the
appellees
here
and
by
persons
in
other
cases
that
our
interpretation
of
1983
will
impede
the
state
courts
in
the
normal
operation
of
the
criminal
laws.
it
will
and
that
is
exactly
what
was
intended
by
section
1983
of
the
civil
rights
law.
and
the
legislative
history
makes
it
clear,
not
in
all
cases
but
in
certain
kinds
of
cases,
cases
coming
within
section
1983
that
it
was
the
intent
of
congress
to
protect
persons
whose
rights
were
being
interfered
with
by
state
officials
including
state
courts
to
protect
them
by
giving
them
resort
to
a
federal
court.
and
i
cannot
see
how
it
is
possible
to
read
the
legislative
history
all
of
which
is
set
forth
in
the
watkins
law
review
article
at
a
considerable
length.
and
some
of
which
is
referred
to
also
by
professor
amsterdam
in
his
university
of
pennsylvania
law
review
article,
i
do
not
see
how
and
i
could
quote
professor
amsterdam,
“it
is
impossible
to
read
the
debates
without
concluding
that
the
federal
legislatures
were
intensely
aware
of
the
hostility
and
antiunion”
meaning,
northern
not
trade
union,
“prejudice
of
the
southern
state
courts
and
the
use
of
state
court
proceedings
to
harass
those
whom
the
union
had
an
obligation
to
protect.”
that
is
the
law
that
we
are
talking
about
today.
it's
section
1983
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1871.
and
to
say
that
congress
intended
that
a
person
who
is
being
improperly
prosecuted,
who
is
being
harassed,
whose
rights
are
being
taken
away
from
him
by
a
state
official
may
not
apply
to
a
federal
court
for
assistance
under
section
1983
is
to
fly
in
the
face
of
the
direct
intent
of
congress
in
passing
that
law.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
i
think
he
did
say
that
was
the
reason
for
the
removal
of
statute.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
well,
this
court
has
held
that
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
well,
it
may
be
that
they
were
giving
them
two
chances
to
get
into
the
federal
court,
yes.
i
think
that
congress
was
much
concerned
with
giving
as
much
protection
as
possible
to
the
persons
to
whom
--
whose
problems
it
was
addressing
itself
in
these
statutes.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
yes
sir,
i
think
that
would
be
true.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
if
it
had
removal,
it
would
just
involve
that
one
case.
if
he
had
injunction,
it
might
just
involve
that
one
case.
there
is
no
particular
reason
to
believe
that
every
injunction
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
that
is
true,
there
is
a
difference.
there
are
other
differences
also.
there
is
the
fact
for
example
that
under
the
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
that
is
true
but
this
kind
--
that
kind
of
case
would
be
available,
that
is
a
1983
case,
would
be
available
to
a
plaintiff
only
in
a
case
where
he
could
come
within
the
four
corners
of
the
act,
namely
that
his
constitutional
rights
were
being
interfered
with
by
state
officers
acting
under
color
of
law.
and
that
he
would
have
to
come
within
that
kind
of
a
case.
and
if
he
came
within
that
kind
of
a
case,
the
federal
--
the
congress
intended
to
give
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
well,
no,
obviously
every
act,
every
arrest
is
certainly
under
color
of
a
state
law.
but
the
statute
refers
to
a
person
who
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
who
is
denied
his
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
and
deprived
of
any
rights,
privileges,
or
immunity
secured
by
the
constitution
and
laws
of
the
united
states.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
and
it
is
in
that
kind
of
a
case
not
in
a
robbery
case,
not
in
a
blackmail
case
to
refer
to
some
of
the
situations
that
have
been
referred
to
here
in
this
morning.
but
only
in
the
case
where
a
person
has
been
deprived
of
his
rights
secured
by
the
constitution
and
laws
of
the
united
states.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
i
assume
that
in
order
to
secure
an
injunction
from
a
federal
court
you
would
have
to
show
more
than
a
mere
allegation.
you
would
have
to
present
the
situation
in
which
either
the
statute
involved
was
on
its
face
unconstitutional
because
it
deprived
the
petitioner
or
of
a
plaintiff
in
that
situation
of
rights,
privileges
and
immunity
secured
to
him
by
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
or
some
other
action
to
come
within
the
statute.
a
mere
allegation
that
i
am
being
arrested
for
blackmail
and
this
is
a
violation
of
my
constitutional
rights
is
not
sufficient
to
come
within
the
statute
and
i
assume
that
any
federal
district
court
confronted
by
this
problem
will
so
hold.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
if
that
is
what
happens
and
i
think
he
may
be
entitled
to
federal
protection.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
it
may
very
well
and
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
--
and
i
think
it
quite
possible
that
in
a
setting
of
1871,
it
may
be
that
many
offenses
would
normally
have
come
within
the
purview
of
congress
which
today
we
would
not
normally
think
as
coming
within
the
statute.
but
i
submit
that
that
it
seems
is
what
congress
intended
and
if
it's
too
broad
a
jurisdiction
then
the
remedy
is
a
remedy
to
congress.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
i
believe
that
this
court
has
held
that
--
i
don't
know
if
it's
this
court
or
other
federal
court,
have
held
that
that
is
not
within
seven
--
within
1983.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
well,
i
suppose
a
different
argument
could've
been
made.
we
are
not
confronted
with
that
case
but
i
think
that
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
well,
perhaps
it
would.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
it
--
perhaps
it
would,
perhaps
it
would.
it
doesn't
shock
me
your
honor.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
perhaps
it
would.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
perhaps
it
might
come
to
that
point.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
if
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
if
the
court
felt
that
it
was
prepared
to
extend
the
statute
to
cover
that
kind
of
situation,
now
it
may
very
well
be
and
as
i
say,
i
believe
that
the
courts
have
held
that
mere
matters
of
evidence
do
not
rise
to
the
height
required
by
the
statute.
we
are
not
concerned
in
our
case
with
a
mere
matter
of
evidence.
we
are
concerned
with
the
application
of
the
statute
which
i
submit
is
unconstitutional.
and
it
may
be
that
on
the
outer
reaches
of
the
problem,
there
will
be
questions
raised
but
we're
not
at
the
outer
reaches
at
the
moment.
we
are
right
at
the
center.
now
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
well,
the
circuits
have
not
only
divided
but
within
the
circuits,
there
have
been
divisions.
and
where
there
have
been
in
many
situations
where
there
have
been
decisions
as
for
example
in
the
fourth
circuit.
i
believe
the
fourth
circuit
has
held
that
1983
is
not
an
exception
to
2283
but
there
is
a
very
strong
dissent
by
chief
judge
sobeloff
in
--
i
think
its
baines
against
danville.
in
several
cases
in
the
fifth
circuit,
the
same
conclusion
is
reached
but
again
there
have
been
dissents
by
judges
reeves
and
wisdom
so
that
--
although
the
court
--
in
the
third
circuit
in
i
think
cooper
against
hutchison,
the
decision
is
the
other
way.
there
are
two
very
recent
fifth
circuit
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
it
held
that
20
--
1983
was
an
exception
to
2283.
there
are
two
recent
decisions
in
the
fifth
circuit.
one,
a
decision
by
judge
thornberry
and
the
other,
a
decision
by
judge
bell,
which
holds
that
section
1983
is
an
exception
to
2283;
both
of
them
unanimous
--
unanimous
decisions,
and
have
--
and
has
--
he
has
held
that
those
--
those
--
that
--
those
two
courts
have
held
that
2283
is
not
a
jurisdictional
statute
at
all.
but
the
2283
is
a
discretionary
statute
and
that
it
is
i
suppose
equivalent
to
the
co-question
of
abstention.
and
i
must
get
on
if
i
may
your
honors,
i
know
this
is
critical
to
the
dissent,
but
on
the
question
of
abstention
leaving
the
statute
aside
because
i
would
assume
that
the
general
rules
of
jeannette
against
--
douglas
against
jeannette
and
so
forth
might
cause
a
court
to
hold
that
it
is
going
to
abstain
even
if
it
has
jurisdiction
under
2283.
it
still
may
abstain
and
i
raise
the
question
as
to
whether
abstention
has
any
justification
at
all
in
this
case.
incidentally,
the
right
of
a
court
to
abstain
this,
mr.
justice
white
is
perhaps
the
answer
to
your
question
that
where
there
are
merely
matters
of
evidence
involved
that
the
federal
court
out
of
considerations
of
comity
and
all
of
the
considerations
in
douglas
against
jeannette
will
decide
that
it
will
abstain.
in
this
case,
there
is
no
reason
for
abstention
at
all.
we
know
as
a
matter
of
fact
because
it
has
decided
it
--
the
matter
in
the
epton
case
what
the
state
court
is
going
to
decide
with
respect
to
this
case.
we
know
what
its
interpretation
of
the
law
will
be.
there
is
no
reason
to
wait
to
find
out.
this
is
exactly
the
situation
in
the
allegheny
against
mashuda
case
except
that
the
complicating
circumstances
which
led
to
the
dissent
in
that
case
are
present
here.
this
is
the
situation
in
koota
against
zwickler.
this
is
a
situation
where
a
state
law
is
clear,
not
on
its
face,
of
course,
it's
very
unclear
on
its
face
but
it
is
clear
because
there
has
been
a
limiting
construction.
we
contend
a
limiting
construcion
and
unconstitutional
application.
it
has
given
that
limiting
instruction
and
unconstitutional
application
in
the
epton
case.
epton
in
effect
has
been
running
interference
for
us.
he
has
cleared
away
the
ambiguities
in
the
statute
and
there
is
no
reason
for
further
abstention
by
this
court
because
nothing
will
be
gained
by
abstention.
we
know
what
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
is
going
to
hold
and
what
it
is
going
to
hold
is
that
it
has
amended
the
gitlow
statute
so
that
it
now
has
a
limiting
construction.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
epton
was
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
yes,
certiorari
was
denied
because
there
was
an
independent
state
ground
for
the
decision.
there
had
been
concurrent
sentences
exactly
the
same
thing,
not
only
can
but
almost
certainly
will
happen
here
so
that
we
will
be
confronted
once
again
with
the
situation
where
this
court
may
not
accept
certiorari
because
there
is
an
independent
state
ground
for
the
sentence
and
we
will
be
faced
with
the
possibility
of
still
further
conspiracy,
criminal
anarchy
prosecutions
in
new
york
and
as
long
as
it
is
paired
with
the
conventional
state
crime,
we
can
never
a
juris
--
a
decision
from
this
court
as
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
state
sedition
law.
now,
my
time
is
about
up,
i
just
would
like
to
mention
one
thing
and
there
are
others
mentioned
in
the
brief
but
let
me
just
get
to
this
one
thing
because
i
think
it's
decisive
on
the
question
of
constitutionality
and
that
is
what
i
have
referred
to
as
the
amendment
of
the
gitlow
statute
by
the
state
court.
the
state
court
at
the
very
opening
of
its
decision
said,
“we
are
thus
presented
with
the
statute
which
is
unconstitutional
as
interpreted”,
and
they
then
go
ahead
to
reinterpret.
now,
the
difficulty
with
that
when
we
pointed
that
out
to
the
three-judge
court,
the
three-judge
court
said,
“oh,
well
this
is
a
matter
for
the
state
to
decide
if
they
want
to
give
their
court
of
appeals
the
right
to
amend
the
law,
that's
their
business.
it's
not
a
federal
question.”
but
it
is
a
federal
question
because
if
the
legislature
had
made
this
amendment,
we
would
have
an
ex
post
facto
situation
here.
what
--
because
the
court
amended
the
statute
we
have
to
ex
post
facto
situation
because
this
law
was
amended,
reinterpreted,
whatever
you
want
to
call
it,
by
the
state
legislature
after
the
acts
complained
of
in
this
indictment.
this
incidentally
is
the
subject
of
the
dissent,
the
very
strong
dissent
by
judge
burke
in
our
court
of
appeals
in
which
he
pointed
out
that
there
was
no
notice
to
the
defendant
that
this
statute
was
going
to
be
reinterpreted.
the
defendant
if
e
had
consulted
any
lawyer
in
new
york
would
have
told
and
there
was
no
valid
criminal
anarchy
law
in
new
york
because
gitlow
was
so
clearly
unconstitutional.
and
no
one
could
have
had
the
clairvoyance
to
have
seen
that
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
was
going
to
amend
the
law.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
i
think
not,
your
honor.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
no.
i
have
discussed
the
matter
in
my
brief
and
i
just
don't
have
the
time
to
discuss
it.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
may
it
please
the
court,
if
the
court
would
relieve
the
district
attorney
of
queens
of
the
stipulation
that
was
entered
in
too
long
ago
about
delaying
this
prosecution
pending
disposition
by
this
court,
we
will
immediately
prosecute
them
tomorrow
morning.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
like
the
others
on
the
calendar
this
week
was
here
for
the
third
time
and
like
the
other
cases,
it
involves
a
common
question
concerning
the
propriety
of
a
federal
injunction,
on
some
cases,
a
declaratory
judgment
against
a
pending
state
criminal
prosecution.
i
am
going
to
address
myself
initially
and
perhaps
exclusively
to
that
problem.
the
companion
problem
of
a
constitutionality
of
the
state
law
has
been
briefed,
it's
been
argued
twice
and
in
the
time
of
available
to
me,
i
may
not
get
to
it.
nor
will
i
restate
the
facts,
except
to
call
to
the
attention
of
the
court
two
things
--
two
items
which
i
think
are
of
considerable
importance.
in
the
first
place,
there
is
no
abstention
problem
at
all,
in
this
case.
the
state
court
in
the
epton
case
has
passed
upon
the
statute,
has
given
an
up-to-date
reading
of
the
statue
and
we
therefore
must
assume
that
the
state
court
will
apply
the
same
reading
to
this
case.
there
is
no
--
nothing
to
abstain
for.
we
have
already
gone
through
the
procedure
of
getting
a
state
court
interpretation
of
the
statute
and
i
do
not
understand
that
either
the
attorney
general
or
the
district
attorney
argues
that
we
should
abstain.
the
second
point
that
i
would
like
to
make
is
that
this
is
a
multi-count
indictment.
in
addition
to
several
counts
of
the
indictment,
which
are
under
attack
here,
there
are
a
large
other,
number
of
other
counts,
some
15
or
20
of
them
which
alleged
substantive
crimes
and
conspiracy
to
commit
substantive
crimes,
crimes
of
arson,
of
riot,
of
the
possession
of
guns,
of
the
possession
of
explosives,
conspiracy
to
commit
arson.
all
of
those
are
in
the
indictment
and
in
our
opinion
give
the
state
all
of
the
protection
that
it
needs.
on
each
of
the
previous
arguments,
a
question
has
been
raised
by
the
bench
as
to
why
these
cases
have
not
proceeded
in
view
of
the
fact
that
there
was
no
injunction
issued
by
the
three-judge
court.
and
it
has
been
explained
to
the
court
that
they
have
not
proceeded
because
an
assistant
district
attorney
entered
into
a
stipulation.
this
is
the
explanation
given
by
the
district
attorney.
an
assistant
district
attorney
entered
into
a
stipulation
in
which
he
agreed
that
he
would
not
proceed
with
the
prosecution
here
until
this
case
had
been
finally
determined
because
then,
no
one
thought
it
would
take
so
long
to
finally
determine
it.
i
would
like
to
point
and
i
might
say
that
ethics
on
the
part
of
the
district
attorney
to
relieve
itself
of
that
stipulation
have
thus
far
been
unsuccessful
although
he
has
made
efforts
in
the
federal
district
court.
i
might
say
that
that
stipulation
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
substantive
crimes
here.
if
the
district
attorney
had
wished
to
proceed
on
the
substantive
crimes,
they
could
have
been
tried
and
the
appeals
concluded
and
probably
the
sentence
is
served
if
they
had
been
found
guilty
before
we
had
gotten
to
this
point.
i
think
that
it
might
be
appropriate
to
just
say
a
few
words
of
history
here,
not
at
the
moment
the
history
of
1983,
but
the
history
of
the
power
of
the
federal
court
to
enjoin
state
criminal
proceedings.
that
is
not
an
invention
of
dombrowski.
for
75
years,
at
least
the
federal
courts
--
75
years
prior
to
dombrowski,
the
federal
courts
enjoined
the
threatened
enforcement
of
state
unconstitutional
laws.
this
was
not
a
doctrine
that
was
born
in
1965.
i
don't
know
when
it
started.
but
in
1897
in
smyth
against
ames,
the
united
states
district
court
enjoined
the
prosecution
of
a
state
criminal
law.
in
ex
parte
young1
of
course,
the
same
thing
happened.
in
truax
against
raich
in
1950,
chief
justice,
then
justice
hughes
said,
“while
the
court
of
equity
has
no
jurisdiction
--”
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
excuse
me.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
oh!
i
am
sorry.
“while
the
court
of
equity
generally
speaking
has
no
jurisdiction
over
the
prosecution
of
crimes
on
misdemeanors,
equitable
jurisdiction
exist
to
restrain
criminal
prosecutions
under
unconstitutional
enactments,
when
the
prevention
of
such
prosecutions
is
essential
to
the
safeguarding
of
the
rights
of
property
in
the
absence
of
inadequate
remedy
at
law.”
and
in
terrace
against
thompson
in
1923,
this
court
repeating
in
effect
that
language
when
on
to
say
that
the
plaintiff's
“are
not
obliged”
to
take
the
risk
of
prosecution,
fines
and
imprisonment
and
loss
of
property
in
order
to
secure
an
adjudication
of
their
rights.
then
came
douglas
against
jeannette,
i
suggest
that
douglas
against
jeannette
was
a
support
and
it
happened
primarily
because
on
the
same
day
as
we
all
know,
the
court
issued
--
this
court
issued
its
declaratory
judgment
in
the
murdock
case
holding
the
same
statute
unconstitutional
and
it
appeared
that
in
injunction
under
those
circumstances
would
be
unnecessary.
but
the
fact
was
that
as
of
douglas
against
jeannette,
we
find
this
court
giving
much
more
protection
to
property
rights
than
it
gave
to
first
amendment
rights
despite
the
contrary
history
of
this
court
through
the
famous
footnote
4
in
the
carolene
products
and
thomas
against
collins
and
that
whole
line
of
cases
still
consistently
applied
by
this
court
which
has
pointed
to
the
fragile
nature
of
first
amendment
rights,
which
has
pointed
to
the
fact
that
they
need
more
protection,
quicker
protection
than
property
rights
and
which
in
fact
has
given
that
protection.
except
that
somehow
in
this
area
between
douglas
and
jeannette
and
dombrowski,
this
rule
was
not
observed
in
this
specific
problem
of
securing
an
injunction.
then
dombrowski
came
along
and
i
submit,
it
put
douglas
against
jeannette
in
its
proper
place
and
i
am
not
now
referring
to
the
abstention
aspects
of
the
dombrowski
case
because
as
i
say
there
is
no
abstention
issues
in
this
case
but
i
am
referring
to
the
availability
of
injunctive
relief
to
stop
the
enforcement
of
a
state
criminal
prosecution.
in
the
period
prior
to
dombrowski
while
this
problem
of
an
injunction
remedy
was
being
worked
out,
a
parallel
development
in
terms
of
the
substantive
law
was
being
developed
which
culminated
in
baggett
against
bullitt
and
it
might
be
said
that
a
combination
of
the
old
doctrine
of
ex
parte
young
and
the
substantive
rule
of
baggett
against
bullitt
produced
the
dombrowski
decision.
and
as
i
read
dombrowski,
the
court
would
have
been
unanimous
on
this
case
and
that
there
is
no
abstention
problem
and
as
i
read
the
dissent
in
the
dombrowski
case,
it
is
based
exclusively
on
abstention.
the
dombrowski
rule
has
turned
out
to
be
a
very
powerful
weapon
in
protecting
civil
liberties
and
first
amendment
rights.
and
it
is
ever
so
much
more
important
now
and
has
been
for
the
past
15-20
years,
that
is
the
problem
of
first
--
protection
of
first
amendment
rights
much
more
important
than
it
ever
was
in
the
fifth
and
the
last
five
or
six
years
in
which
the
dombrowski
remedy
has
been
available.
the
technique,
the
remedial
device
provided
by
dombrowski
has
been
of
an
estimable
value
in
protecting
first
amendment
rights,
which
always
in
our
country
need
and
have
continued
and
will
probably
continue
to
need
full
protection.
the
issue
here
relates
to
the
application
of
the
doctrine,
i
think
the
doctrine
of
ex
parte
young
and
the
doctrine
of
dombrowski
to
pending
criminal
prosecutions
as
distinguished
from
criminal
prosecutions
that
are
not
pending
but
are
merely
threatened.
now
in
substantive
terms,
the
distinction
seems
quite
illogical.
the
injury
to
the
plaintiff
is
exactly
the
same.
the
interference
in
a
substantive
sense
with
state
processes
is
exactly
the
same.
it
is
often
impossible
for
an
individual
to
foresee
a
criminal
prosecution.
and
i
think
the
remarks
by
mr.
reed
in
the
case
that
was
just
argued
make
it
difficult
for
a
potential
defendant
who
has
not
yet
been
arrested
to
establish
standing
and
if
he
has
already
been
arrested,
he
is
faced
with
the
problem
that
we
are
all
faced
with
here
today.
last
week,
i
argued
a
case
in
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
second
circuit
in
which
i
argued
in
allege
violation
of
the
new
york
state
flag
statute.
i
argued
that
man
whose
neighbors
had
been
arrested
and
who
had
seen
the
rest
surround
him
on
all
sides
throughout
new
york
state
for
a
specific
violation
of
the
flag
statute
should
be
and
who
had
a
flag
like
that
and
wish
to
fly
it
should
be
entitled
to
an
injunction.
and
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
new
york
came
in
and
said,
“it's
too
early.
he
hasn't
been
arrested
yet.”
so
that
we
have
a
situation
in
which
either
you
are
too
early
or
too
late.
either
you
have
no
standing
or
you
are
barred
by
2283.
now
of
course
there
are
cases
where
as
a
result
of
some
sort
of
a
peculiar
procedure
of
situation
as
in
dombrowski
itself
that
happens
to
be
a
moment
in
between
the
threat
of
prosecution
and
the
actual
arrest.
but
that
does
not
happen
in
the
normal
case
and
it's
really
the
extraordinary
case
in
which
it
does
happen.
and
so
we
have
the
thing
that
all
of
us
don't
like,
namely
the
race
to
the
courthouse
door
to
see
who
can
get
in
there
first,
whether
we
can
come
before
the
state
prosecution
or
after
the
state
prosecution
and
it
seems
to
me
that
this
results
in
a
totally
unsatisfactory
situation.
thank
you.
[lunch
recess]
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
i
recalled
at
lunch
where
i
had
intended
to
say
in
connection
with
that
line
of
cases
of
smyth
against
ames
and
ex
parte
young
and
so
forth,
that
i
must
point
out
in
all
candid
that
in
some
of
those
cases
and
perhaps
all
of
them.
the
court
did
point
out
that
it
was
not
a
pending
proceeding
and
that
under
the
provisions
of
2283,
they
could
not
have
enjoined
a
pending
state
proceeding.
so
there
is
of
course
that
difference.
i
think
that
that
difference
does
not
apply
here
and
that
brings
us
to
the
next
point
on
why
not
extend
ex
parte
young
and
dombrowski
to
pending
criminal
cases.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
yes,
this
is
a
pending
proceeding.
oh!
yes.
it
presents
that
issue
very
squarely.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
well,
my
associate,
my
friend,
mr.
ludwig
will
tell
us
that.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
i
don't
of
course
know
what
the
evidence
was.
all
i
know
was
that
there
was
an
indictment.
i
wasn't
present
at
the
grand
jury
and
what
evidence
was
produced
before
the
grand
jury
i
don't
know
nor
except
anything
in
the
record.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
and
i
think
he
has
the
other
two
times.
i
suppose
he
will
this
time
also.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
oh!
there
was
a
great
deal
of
publicity
at
the
time.
yes.
now
when
we
get
to
the
question
of
the
extension
of
this
doctrine
to
pending
criminal
cases,
we're
confronted
of
course
with
this
question
of
2283.
i
might
say
that
the
district
court
in
this
case
jumped
right
over
the
threshold.
they
did
not
give
any
consideration
to
what
we
have
referred
to
at
the
threshold
problem
they
got
right
into
the
constitutionality
of
statute,
felt
that
the
statute
was
constitutional
and
thus
avoided
any
necessity
of
considering
this
problem
at
all.
2283
of
course
presents
a
problem
which
we
think
is
met
by
the
fact
that
we
argue
that
section
1983
of
the
civil
rights
law
of
1870
or
71
specifically
intended
to
provide
an
additional
exception
to
2283.
and
the
statute
itself
makes
no
distinction
between
pending
cases
and
cases
which
are
not
yet
pending
and
it
seems
hardly,
likely
that
the
congress
of
1871
was
tremendously
concerned
over
the
problem
of
the
federal
government
stepping
in
and
interfering
with
state
procedures.
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
legislative
history
of
that
act
which
has
been
discussed
in
a
number
of
law
review
articles
which
are
cited
in
my
brief
syracuse
law
review
and
pennsylvania
law
review
and
elsewhere.
i
can't
go
into
it
now.
of
course,
it
seems
to
us
makes
it
clear
that
what
congress
was
addressing
itself
to
is
the
very
specific
problem
of
abuses
by
state
court
as
well
as
by
other
state
agencies
and
the
suggestion
that
congress
intended
to
permit
injunctions
to
be
applied
before
state
prosecution
occurs
rather
than
after
state
prosecution
occurs.
there
is
certainly
no
way
as
suggested
in
the
legislative
history
at
all.
and
i
would
like
to
point
out
and
mr.
justice
marshall
mentioned
this
at
the
last
document
that
in
the
series
of
laws
that
were
passed
after
the
civil
war,
congress
provided
for
another
example
of
stepping
in
and
gave
the
federal
courts
an
opportunity
to
step
into
a
state
court
proceeding
right
in
the
middle
of
a
trial,
not
merely
after
an
indictment
but
right
in
the
middle
of
a
trial
in
the
removal
situation
and
gave
the
federal
courts
under
some
circumstances
which
may
be
limited
but
nevertheless,
they
do
exist.
circumstances
in
which
state
court
could
--
federal
court
could
come
in
or
at
least
a
defendant
in
the
criminal
case
could
remove
to
the
federal
court
thus
stopping
a
criminal
trial
right
smack
in
the
middle
of
it,
a
position
that
we
don't
have
to
go
through
so
far
as
this
case
is
concerned.
now,
of
course
as
i
say
i
cannot
at
this
time
and
there'd
be
no
point
in
oral
argument
anyhow
in
reviewing
the
legislative
history
of
the
acts
of
1870
and
1871.
there
is
an
article
by
professor
amsterdam
in
the
university
of
pennsylvania
law
review,
one
in
the
syracuse
law
review
and
perhaps
others
which
do
discus
the
congressional
debates
at
considerable
length
and
come
to
the
conclusion
that
1983
was
intended
to
provide
and
to
carve
out
another
exception
to
2283.
so
we
believe
and
all
i
can
do
refer
to
that
legislative
history
that
there
is
no
bar
in
2283
to
the
relief
that
we
are
requesting
here.
i
would
be
blind
and
i
suppose
deaf
also
if
i
did
--
were
not
aware
of
the
fact
that
there
is
a
grave
concern
that
the
position
which
i
am
advocating
here
might
lend
itself
to
a
great
deal
of
abuse.
that
at
the
drop
of
a
hat,
defendants
in
either
anticipated
or
pending
criminal
court
cases
will
go
plunging
into
the
federal
courts
at
the
drop
of
a
hat
and
will
seek
and
secure
injunctions
which
will
tie
up
state
court
proceedings.
i
suppose
that
any
doctrine
that
any
court
can
apply
under
some
circumstances
is
subject
to
what
might
be
called
abuse.
lawyers
representing
defendants
are
ingenious,
they
are
imaginative,
many
of
them
and
they
do
think
up
or
try
to
think
up
devices
to
protect
their
clients
as
vigorously
and
as
well
as
they
can
and
i
have
no
doubt
that
any
kind
of
a
procedural
device
will
give
rise
to
certain
cases
where
some
people
will
say
that
the
procedural
devices
are
being
abused
and
i
think
that
is
what
the
courts
are
for.
the
courts
are
there
to
prevent
such
abuse
if
it
be
an
abuse
from
taking
place.
and
i
am
not
--
well
i
was
going
to
say,
i'm
not
very
much
concerned
but
it
isn't
my
job
to
be
concerned.
i
don't
--
i
suggest
that
courts
need
not
be
excessively
concerned
over
this
problem.
by
hypothesis,
these
cases
come
before
three-judge
courts
and
as
was
pointed
out
by
i
think
mr.
reed
in
the
argument
before,
the
three-judge
court
includes
a
court
of
the
--
judge
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
possibility
that
injunctions
will
be
scattered
far
and
wide
on
trivial
pretext,
i
think
is
a
relatively
minor
one.
furthermore,
i
do
think
that
much
of
the
problem
can
be
solved
by
a
proper
hammering
out
or
proper
abstention
rules
which
will
see
to
it
that
lawyers
do
not
come
into
the
federal
courts
prematurely
and
that
the
possibility
of
flooding
the
federal
criminal
courts
every
time
somebody
is
arrested
for
disorderly
conduct
charged
under
statute
that
somebody
claims
is
unconstitutional.
again,
it
can
be
prevented
by
as
i
say
proper
abstention
rules
and
proper
use
of
discretion
by
the
three-judge
court.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
no,
i
do
not.
i
have
heard
that
there
has
been
a
substantial
increase
though.
i
really
don't
know
what
the
statistics
are.
i
do
know
the
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
i'm
sure
would
have
that
and
i
really
don't
know
whether
there
has
been
an
increase
or
what
the
increase
has
been.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
well
as
i
say,
i
have
the
impression
that
there
has
been
an
increase
in
the
number
of
three
judge
courts
and
how
many
of
them
are
attributable
to
this
kind
of
case,
i
also
don't
know
and
i
have
never
made
such
an
analysis
and
i
don't
know
what
the
answer
to
that
is.
as
i
say,
i
think
that
there
are
ways
of
handling
that
other
than
by
throwing
out
the
baby
and
that
the
rule
of
the
dombrowski
case
judiciously
applied
to
pending
criminal
cases
would
have
a
great
--
a
statutory
effect
in
the
protection
of
first
amendment
rights.
i
am
not
suggesting
that
this
be
extended
to
all
kinds
of
cases
and
i
don't
think
anybody
has
suggested
that,
but
we
do
have
and
have
always
recognized
an
exception
in
the
area
of
first
amendment
rights
and
i
do
think
that
the
retreat
and
i
would
call
it
a
retreat
in
this
situation
would
be
disadvantageous
to
a
protection
of
those
rights.
i
might
point
out
that
their
relegation
the
plaintiffs
to
the
state
court
of
remedies
in
this
case
would
really
be
serious
because
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
well,
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
well,
that
maybe
true.
perhaps,
let
me
say
it
that
shutting
off
the
remedy
that
we
are
appealing
for
or
applying
for
in
this
situation
may
very
well
mean
that
there
will
never
be
an
adjudication
of
the
new
york
state
criminal
anarchy
statute
for
the
reason
that
i
know
the
court
is
familiar
with
and
that
your
honor
discussed
in
the
epton
cases
because
there
are
along
series
of
substantive
crimes.
and
if
the
defendant's
are
to
be
--
will
be
found
guilty
of
any
of
the
substantive
crimes
and
they
may
be,
then
we
may
be
confronted
this
time
and
the
next
time
and
the
next
time
and
the
next
time
with
repetitions
of
the
epton
situation
in
which
this
court
refuses
to
grant
certiorari
because
there
is
an
independent
state
ground
justifying
the
sentence
with
the
result
that
the
statute
may
remain
on
the
books
as
an
in
terrorem
device
for
a
long
period
of
time
and
that
seems
to
us
partly
unjustified
given
the
nature
of
the
statute
and
if
as
we
contend
the
statute
is
unconstitutional.
and
i
might
say
that
it
is
rather
difficult
for
me
to
imagine
how
a
plaintiff
could
come
into
court
and
seek
relief
under
this
statute
prior
to
indictment.
it
seems
to
me
and
would
be
in
the
most
unusual
situation
if
a
plaintiff
came
in
and
said,
“i
am
intending
to
engage
in
conduct
which
may
violate
the
state
criminal
anarchy
law
and
i
want
an
adjudication
of
which
will
violate
the
state
from
criminal
anarchy
law
and
i
want
an
adjudication
because
the
law
is
unconstitutional.”
i
would
say
that
that
remedy
which
is
open
and
perhaps
some
kind
of
situations
would
not
be
open
to
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case.
