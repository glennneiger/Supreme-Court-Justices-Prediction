may
i
ask
why
spend
the
two
years
without
prosecuting
them
for
all
these
offenses
you
talked
about?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
weinstein,
i
don't
think
we'd
have
any
problem
in
this
case
if
what
you're
arguing
to
is,
was
the
position
or
is
the
position
of
the
united
states
government
that
this
is
an
adversary
suit
between
the
united
states
and
the
state
of
connecticut
and
we
come
into
this
court?
and
we
don't
have
an
adversary
proceeding
at
all.
we
have
no
argument
at
all
on
the
part
of
the
united
states
in
this
court
as
to
what
it
believes
the
public
interest
is
or
the
rights
of
these
veterans.
we
have
a
contrary
view
that
is
the
opposite
of
what
the
government
says
officially.
and
we
close
this
case
without
any
argument
at
all
from
the
government
as
to
why
it
agrees
with
the
state
of
connecticut
in
this
particular
matter.
isn't
that
a
strange
situation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
here
is
a
different
situation.
that's
two
agencies
of
the
government.
but
here
all
we
have
here
as
i
see
it
is
that
the
government,
the
official
position
of
the
government
is
that
the
statute
of
the
state
is
constitutional.
and
this
is
an
internal
fight
in
the
department
and
the
solicitor
general
having
taken
the
official
position
for
the
government
does
not
appear,
and
those
in
his
employ
come
here
and
argue
the
opposite
way
from
the
way
he
comes
out,
and
will
after
that
any
argument
at
all
on
the
part
of
the
united
states.

we
haven't
had
it
because
of
an
internal
difference
of
opinion
in

where
the

of

prevail
over
