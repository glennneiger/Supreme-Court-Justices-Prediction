by
the
way,
do
you
challenge
here
in
your

the
constitutionality

justice
byron
r.
white
of
the
gloss
that
the
court
did
put
on
the
statute
in
epton?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
how
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
about
people
today
though?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
raise
that
question
up
here
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
as
narrowed
in
epton?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
you
didn't
argue
it
in
your
brief,
did
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
in
any
way?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
in
any
event,
i
gather
the
constitutionality
of
the
narrowed
statute
is
raised
squarely
in
the
other
case
also,
in
the
cases
just
been
argued.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
servicemen
have
no
right
to
be
in
the
trial
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
to
be
here
at
all.
you
agree
with
that,
don't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
there's
no
question
in
that
case
that
you're
about
extend
the
statute
to
give
you
the
authority
to
do
what
you're
doing
in
this
statute
as
a
matter
between
the
state
and
the
servicemen
and
the
criminal
case
between
the
united
states
and
the
defendant.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
just
because
the
united
states
says
that
this
--
that
they're
confession
of
error
doesn't
necessarily
mean
that
the
court
has
to
accept,
or
that
there
isn't
any
case
of
controversy
in
this
situation.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
your
separate
rationale
from
the
arlington
county?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
the
--
what
about
an
ordinary
criminal
prosecution,
narcotics
or
anything
else
and
the
defendant
comes
to
federal
court
saying
that
the
pending
prosecution
against
me
rest
on
evidences
that
within
constitutional
search
and
seizure.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
how
about
--
what
about
your
position?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
why
wouldn't
it
be
included
in
your
argument?
the
way
you
presented
it,
seems
to
me
it
would
squarely
fall
under
your
argument.
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
been
the
division
on
the
circuits
on
this
point?
justice
byron
r.
white
we
held
that
--
it
held
that
was
within
the
exception.
justice

that's
under
submission
now
to
the
court

appeals?
