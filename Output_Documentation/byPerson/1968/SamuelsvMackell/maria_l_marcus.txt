ms.
maria
l.
marcus
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
counsel
for
appellant
samuels
in
his
brief
has
asked
that
the
clear
and
present
danger
test
which
this
court
approved
in
dennis
be
overruled.
he
has
not
suggested
any
substitute
test.
it
is
apparently
his
position
that
advocating
the
overthrow
of
the
government
must
always
be
a
form
of
protected
speech
regardless
of
its
intent,
regardless
of
the
context,
regardless
of
the
circumstances.
this
interpretation
of
the
first
amendment
is
erroneous
because
it
totally
ignores
the
physical
danger
that
can
be
created
by
a
speech.
as
in
an
analogous
situation
of
a
man
shouting
fire
in
a
crowded
theater,
we
must
look
to
the
intent
and
possible
consequences
of
speech
in
order
to
determine
whether
it
is
within
the
protected
area.
in
the
case
at
bar,
the
entire
fabric
of
the
answered
question
was
the
intent
to
use
force
to
immobilize
state
and
local
authority.
aside
from
the
non-speech
elements
which
have
already
been
described,
the
act
of
speech
were
very
far
from
intellectual
discussion
of
doctrine
but
instead
sent
it
around,
organizing
youth
for
acts
of
violence
in
queens
county,
how
to
use
pipes
and
gunpowder
for
the
making
of
bombs
and
proficiency
in
terror
tactics.
without
the
anarchy
statute,
only
the
weapons
counts
not
requiring
intent
and
the
arson
counts
would
proceed
and
the
indictment
would
have
to
be
dismissed
against
approximately
ten
defendants
even
though
there
actions
created
a
clear
and
present
danger.
it
is
not
difficult
to
apply
the
clear
and
present
danger
test
and
the
required
showing
of
incitement
to
action
to
these
charges.
there
are
reasonable
grounds
to
believe
that
the
threat
to
the
state's
functioning
was
immanent
and
about
to
commence.
this
court
made
clear
in
dennis
that
even
where
an
attempt
to
overthrow
the
government
is
likely
to
fall
short
of
complete
achievement,
it
presents
a
sufficient
evil
for
the
state
to
prevent.
the
court
said
and
i
quote,
“the
damage
with
such
attempts
create
both
physically
and
politically
to
a
nationmakes
it
impossible
to
measure
the
validity
in
terms
of
the
probability
of
success.”
these
words
are
particularly
significant
in
the
light
of
the
indictment
here.
in
new
york
city,
the
cutting
off
of
electrical
power
by
sabotage
combined
with
arson
in
subway
and
transportation
lines
would
not
only
paralyze
the
central
governmental
services
but
would
create
the
kind
of
chaos
which
would
prevent
the
state
from
organizing
and
governing
effectively.
new
york
has
a
right
to
prevent
advocacy
which
is
one
step
before
the
explosion.
counsel
for
appellant
fernandez
pointed
out
that
the
clear
and
present
danger
test
and
the
requirement
of
the
incitement
is
not
cons
--
contained
on
the
face
of
the
statute
but
this
court
made
clear
in
dennis
that
it
does
not
have
to
be
in
high
clear
view
in
the
statute
but
that
it
is
a
test
of
judicial
applicability
that
it
can
be
read
in
and
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
has
already
done
so.
appellants
claim
that
the
statute
at
issue
will
have
a
deterrent
effect
upon
activities
such
as
advocacy
of
unpopular
ideas.
and
i
also
indicate
that
there
can
be
no
such
deterrence
in
this
case.
prosecutions
under
both
the
old
and
the
new
statutes
must
be
governed
by
epton's
requirements.
this
interpretation
places
mere
advocacy
outside
the
ambit
of
the
statute
thus
the
only
group
whose
rights
might
not
be
affected
by
the
epton
decision
would
be
a
hypothetical
group
who
are
deterred
be
--
by
the
statute
prior
to
may
1967
but
who
cannot
be
prosecuted
for
any
of
their
activities
as
the
present
law
forbids
penalizing
advocacy
which
creates
no
clear
and
present
danger.
thus
this
hypothetical
group
cannot
even
be
identified
and
if
they
were
deterred
it
was
by
a
statute
which
is
no
longer
in
existence.
the
hypothetical
rights
of
this
hypothetical
group
most
certainly
do
not
present
any
actual
controversy
and
under
this
court's
rationale
in
golden
versus
zwickler,
decision
rendered
on
such
facts
would
be
advisory
and
therefore
inappropriate.
appellants
say
that
they
were
not
given
notice
that
their
conduct
was
included
in
the
statute.
the
statute
was
made
narrower
by
the
epton
interpretation
therefore
there'd
be
no
question,
the
statute
as
written
provided
warning
of
its
applicability
to
the
conduct
here
involved.
furthermore,
the
hardcore
activities
at
issue
here
as
the
court
below
pointed
on
at
the
very
center
of
the
statute's
circumference.
as
indicated
by
this
court
on
the
procedural
issue,
congress
has
constitutional
power
to
provide
that
all
federal
issues
be
tried
in
the
federal
courts,
that
all
be
tried
in
the
state
courts
or
that
the
jurisdiction
of
such
issues
be
shared.
congress
is
constitutionally
free
to
establish
the
conditions
under
which
civil
or
criminal
proceedings
involving
federal
issues
may
be
removed
from
one
court
to
another.
while
the
right
to
free
speech
and
the
right
to
due
process
are
conferred
by
the
constitution,
the
question
of
proper
forum
is
statutory.
section
2283
has
plainly
precluded
injunctive
relief
in
the
pending
prosecution.
counsel
for
appellant
fernandez
argues
that
declaratory
relief
would
not
violate
the
statute
and
will
forward
essentially
the
same
remedy.
however,
the
rendering
of
such
relief
would
frustrate
the
purposes
of
section
2283
and
destroy
the
principles
of
comity
between
state
and
federal
courts.
and
that
in
inevitable
disruption
of
state
prosecutions
would
occur.
state
courts
have
the
same
duty
and
power
to
rule
upon
federal
constitutional
issues
in
the
same
way
as
the
federal
courts
and
in
most
cases
where
a
prosecution
is
already
pending,
less
delay
would
adhere
in
resolving
the
issues
in
the
state
courts.
if
a
statute
is
overbroad,
the
state
courts
have
the
same
power
as
the
federal
courts
to
strike
it
down,
to
prevent
any
chilling
effect
upon
first
amendment
rights.
i
think
the
federal
removal
statute
which
was
referred
to
earlier
by
mr.
justice
marshall
provides
evidence
of
congressional
intent
to
keep
cases
in
the
state
courts
where
there
are
pending
prosecutions
already
commenced.
the
removal
statute
allows
determination
of
state
proceedings
only
in
very
narrow
circumstances
and
this
provides
congressional
guidance
on
the
issue
of
declaratory
judgment.
as
the
clear
and
present
test
is
one
of
judicial
applicability
as
this
court
found
in
dennis
versus
united
states,
the
application
of
this
statute
to
appellants
can
only
be
determined
upon
a
full
record
in
the
state
courts.
the
need
for
such
a
record
supplies
a
further
ground
for
non-intervention
in
this
case.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
i
please
the
court.
this
court
recently
had
occasion
to
examine
and
analyze
section
2283,
the
anti-injunction
statute
in
atlanta
coast
line
railroad
versus
brotherhood
of
locomotive
engineers.
and
although
this
court
was
dealing
there
with
the
necessary
and
effectuation
of
jurisdiction
clause
rather
than
a
authorized
statutory
exception
clause,
the
courts
general
comments
on
the
statute
are
very
pertinent
to
the
case
here
today.
this
court
said
that
2283
is
not
merely
a
rule
of
committee.
it
is
a
biding
rule
on
the
power
of
the
federal
courts
and
that
even
if
general
equitable
principles
as
interventions
are
satisfied
which
are
clearly
not
in
this
case,
the
federal
courts
may
not
intervene
in
a
pending
case
unless
one
of
the
statutory
exceptions
is
involved.
and
mr.
justice
black
further
commented
that
these
statutory
exceptions
should
not
be
enlarged
by
loose
construction.
it
has
already
been
shown
that
section
1983
can
not
be
an
expressly
authorized
exception
to
2283.
in
fact,
not
only
is
there
nothing
in
the
statute
that
so
indicate,
but
the
section
creates
no
substantive
rights,
it
merely
refers
to
rights
already
granted
by
other
statutes
and
by
the
constitution.
thus,
it
is
clear
that
suits
under
1983
can
not
result
in
injunctions
against
state
court
proceedings.
now
appellant
fernandez
argues
that
declaratory
judgment
may
still
issue.
there
is
an
irony
in
this
argument
because
what
it
really
means
is
that
if
a
state
official
is
conscientious
and
he
wishes
to
abide
by
a
federal
court
declaration,
then
a
state
a
state
proceeding
will
be
disrupted,
a
statutory
scheme
nullified.
however,
if
a
state
official
is
not
conscientious,
he
may
continue
with
the
state
proceeding
through
the
usual
appellate
review
and
finally
to
this
court.
now
this
kind
of
penalty
can
not
possibly
have
been
a
congressional
intent
in
enacting
2383.
quite
the
contrary,
its
intent
was
very
clearly
to
prevent
this
kind
of
disruption
of
state
court
proceedings.
now
appellant
--
one
of
the
appellants
stated
that
it
is
illogical
to
distinguish
between
pending
proceedings
and
future
proceedings.
but
this
is
precisely
what
congress
did
in
enacting
the
anti-junction
law.
it
made
that
distinction
because
it
wanted
to
avoid
disruption
of
proceedings
already
commenced.
this
morning,
it
was
suggested
by
counsel
warren
that
once
a
court
had
jurisdiction,
it
could
issue
a
declaratory
judgment
and
if
that
were
not
obeyed,
an
injunction
could
issue
to
effectuate
the
judgment.
in
other
words,
what
he
was
suggesting
was
that
a
two
step
procedure
could
be
used
instead
of
one
step.
now
this
obviously
would
make
unnecessary
the
list
of
exceptions
in
2283
and
in
fact
it
would
make
a
joke
of
2283
because
it
would
merely
mean
that
you
could
accomplish
in
two
steps
what
the
statute
on
its
face
says
you
may
not
accomplish
in
one
step.
it
should
be
pointed
out
that
state
courts
have
both
the
power
and
the
duty
to
rule
upon
federal
constitutional
issues
in
the
same
way
as
a
federal
court.
and
if
a
statute
is
overbroad,
state
courts
have
the
same
power
to
strike
it
down
to
prevent
any
chilling
effect
on
first
amendment
rights.
there
would
be
no
reason
therefore
to
deprive
the
state
courts
of
jurisdiction
over
such
pending
proceedings
and
absolutely
no
basis
for
any
a
priori
assumption
that
such
state
courts
would
be
less
willing
or
less
able
to
protect
rights
originating
in
the
constitution.
congress
has
provided
in
the
federal
removal
statute
for
the
narrow
class
of
cases
in
which
such
judicial
protection
can
not
be
expected.
now
the
cases
at
bar
furthermore,
would
be
unlikely
candidates
for
the
articulation
of
any
new
rule
respecting
declaratory
intervention
since
they
did
not
involve
any
raise
to
the
courthouse
door.
there
was
obviously
no
evidence
of
any
bad
faith
prosecution
and
no
effect
upon
first
amendment
rights.
counsel
for
appellants
has
said
that
there
is
no
abstention
problem
here.
as
mr.
justice
stewart
earlier
pointed
out,
this
court
has
differentiated
non-intervention
from
abstention
and
for
this
reason
in
zwickler
versus
koota
said
that
it
gave
continuing
validity
to
the
principle
of
non-intervention.
there
is
a
difference
between
a
plaintiff
having
his
choice
of
forum
and
a
defendant
in
a
state
proceeding
when
the
tide
is
turned
against
him
wishing
to
come
in
to
the
federal
court
to
disrupt
that
proceeding.
now
counsel
for
appellant
samuels
in
his
brief
suggest
on
the
merits
of
his
case
that
the
clear
and
present
danger
test
which
this
court
approved
in
dennis
be
overruled.
he
hasn't
suggested
any
substitute
test
and
apparently
it's
position
that
speech
can
not
create
the
kind
of
danger
which
the
state
has
a
right
to
prevent
no
matter
what
the
context
or
circumstances
of
that
speech
is.
but
this
court
has
repeatedly
noted
using
the
example
of
the
man
shutting
fire
in
a
crowded
theater
that
something
which
is
pure
speech
can
create
a
physical
danger.
and
so
the
question
is
the
circumstances
and
the
context
of
that
speech.
now
counsel
for
appellant
fernandez
referred
to
pamphlets
and
writings.
but
even
looking
at
these
writings,
they
are
far
from
abstract
intellectual
discussion
of
doctrine,
but
instead
they
sent
it
around
organizing
youth
for
acts
of
violence,
how
to
put
together
gun
powder
and
other
materials
for
the
making
of
bombs
and
proficiency
in
terror
tactics.
these
were
the
writings
that
were
involved.
another
point
was
made
that
the
kind
of
riots
which
you
saw
described
in
the
epton
case
do
not
constitute
overthrow
of
the
government.
i
think
this
is
very
unrealistic
and
naive
theory
because
there
are
many
ways
to
overthrow
government
and
only
one
of
them
is
a
replacement
of
one
group
of
government
officials
by
another
group
of
government
officials.
that
is
one
kind
of
overthrow.
but
another
kind
of
overthrow
very
clearly
is
the
paralysis
of
a
government
system
and
in
new
york
city
for
example,
the
cutting
off
of
electrical
power,
the
sabotage
of
transportation
lines,
attacks
on
the
police
make
it
impossible
for
the
government
to
render
essential
government
services.
and
this
is
as
much
an
overthrow
as
is
the
replacement
of
particular
people,
and
in
fact
it
also
creates
a
kind
of
chaos
which
prevents
government
from
operating
effectively.
appellants
also
claim
that
the
statute
at
issue
will
have
a
deterrent
effect
upon
the
advocacy
of
unpopular
ideas,
but
analysis
indicate
there
can
be
no
such
deterrents
in
this
case.
prosecutions
under
both
the
old
and
the
new
statutes
which
are
called
the
criminal
anarchy
statute
here
must
be
governed
by
the
rules
set
down
in
epton
and
that
decision
made
it
very
clear
that
mere
abstract
advocacy
of
doctrine
is
outside
the
ambit
of
the
statute.
and
therefore,
outside
the
ambit
of
any
prosecution
both
this
one
and
future
prosecutions
therefore,
the
only
ground
whose
rights
might
be
affected
--
might
not
be
affected
by
the
epton
decision
would
be
a
hypothetical
group
which
was
deterred
before
the
epton
decision.
however,
this
group
can
not
be
prosecuted
for
their
activities
because
the
prosecution
places
the
advocation
of
unpopular
ideas
and
such
the
mere
advocation
of
unpopular
ideas
outside
the
statutes
ambit.
and
therefore
this
hypothetical
group
can
not
be
prosecuted
and
for
that
matter
can
not
even
be
identified.
and
this
kind
of
controversy
with
an
unidentified
group
of
these
type
which
can
not
be
prosecuted
obviously
presents
no
live
grievance
under
this
courts
decision
in
golden
versus
zwickler.
so,
that
we
have
here
a
pending
prosecution
and
obviously
no
possible
effect
upon
appellant's
first
amendment
rights.
thank
you.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
counsel
for
appellant
samuels
in
his
brief
has
asked
that
the
clear
and
present
danger
test
which
this
court
approved
in
dennis
be
overruled.
he
has
not
suggested
any
substitute
test.
it
is
apparently
his
position
that
advocating
the
overthrow
of
the
government
must
always
be
a
form
of
protected
speech
regardless
of
its
intent,
regardless
of
the
context,
regardless
of
the
circumstances.
this
interpretation
of
the
first
amendment
is
erroneous
because
it
totally
ignores
the
physical
danger
that
can
be
created
by
a
speech.
as
in
an
analogous
situation
of
a
man
shouting
fire
in
a
crowded
theater,
we
must
look
to
the
intent
and
possible
consequences
of
speech
in
order
to
determine
whether
it
is
within
the
protected
area.
in
the
case
at
bar,
the
entire
fabric
of
the
answered
question
was
the
intent
to
use
force
to
immobilize
state
and
local
authority.
aside
from
the
non-speech
elements
which
have
already
been
described,
the
act
of
speech
were
very
far
from
intellectual
discussion
of
doctrine
but
instead
sent
it
around,
organizing
youth
for
acts
of
violence
in
queens
county,
how
to
use
pipes
and
gunpowder
for
the
making
of
bombs
and
proficiency
in
terror
tactics.
without
the
anarchy
statute,
only
the
weapons
counts
not
requiring
intent
and
the
arson
counts
would
proceed
and
the
indictment
would
have
to
be
dismissed
against
approximately
ten
defendants
even
though
there
actions
created
a
clear
and
present
danger.
it
is
not
difficult
to
apply
the
clear
and
present
danger
test
and
the
required
showing
of
incitement
to
action
to
these
charges.
there
are
reasonable
grounds
to
believe
that
the
threat
to
the
state's
functioning
was
immanent
and
about
to
commence.
this
court
made
clear
in
dennis
that
even
where
an
attempt
to
overthrow
the
government
is
likely
to
fall
short
of
complete
achievement,
it
presents
a
sufficient
evil
for
the
state
to
prevent.
the
court
said
and
i
quote,
“the
damage
with
such
attempts
create
both
physically
and
politically
to
a
nationmakes
it
impossible
to
measure
the
validity
in
terms
of
the
probability
of
success.”
these
words
are
particularly
significant
in
the
light
of
the
indictment
here.
in
new
york
city,
the
cutting
off
of
electrical
power
by
sabotage
combined
with
arson
in
subway
and
transportation
lines
would
not
only
paralyze
the
central
governmental
services
but
would
create
the
kind
of
chaos
which
would
prevent
the
state
from
organizing
and
governing
effectively.
new
york
has
a
right
to
prevent
advocacy
which
is
one
step
before
the
explosion.
counsel
for
appellant
fernandez
pointed
out
that
the
clear
and
present
danger
test
and
the
requirement
of
the
incitement
is
not
cons
--
contained
on
the
face
of
the
statute
but
this
court
made
clear
in
dennis
that
it
does
not
have
to
be
in
high
clear
view
in
the
statute
but
that
it
is
a
test
of
judicial
applicability
that
it
can
be
read
in
and
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
has
already
done
so.
appellants
claim
that
the
statute
at
issue
will
have
a
deterrent
effect
upon
activities
such
as
advocacy
of
unpopular
ideas.
and
i
also
indicate
that
there
can
be
no
such
deterrence
in
this
case.
prosecutions
under
both
the
old
and
the
new
statutes
must
be
governed
by
epton's
requirements.
this
interpretation
places
mere
advocacy
outside
the
ambit
of
the
statute
thus
the
only
group
whose
rights
might
not
be
affected
by
the
epton
decision
would
be
a
hypothetical
group
who
are
deterred
be
--
by
the
statute
prior
to
may
1967
but
who
cannot
be
prosecuted
for
any
of
their
activities
as
the
present
law
forbids
penalizing
advocacy
which
creates
no
clear
and
present
danger.
thus
this
hypothetical
group
cannot
even
be
identified
and
if
they
were
deterred
it
was
by
a
statute
which
is
no
longer
in
existence.
the
hypothetical
rights
of
this
hypothetical
group
most
certainly
do
not
present
any
actual
controversy
and
under
this
court's
rationale
in
golden
versus
zwickler,
decision
rendered
on
such
facts
would
be
advisory
and
therefore
inappropriate.
appellants
say
that
they
were
not
given
notice
that
their
conduct
was
included
in
the
statute.
the
statute
was
made
narrower
by
the
epton
interpretation
therefore
there'd
be
no
question,
the
statute
as
written
provided
warning
of
its
applicability
to
the
conduct
here
involved.
furthermore,
the
hardcore
activities
at
issue
here
as
the
court
below
pointed
on
at
the
very
center
of
the
statute's
circumference.
as
indicated
by
this
court
on
the
procedural
issue,
congress
has
constitutional
power
to
provide
that
all
federal
issues
be
tried
in
the
federal
courts,
that
all
be
tried
in
the
state
courts
or
that
the
jurisdiction
of
such
issues
be
shared.
congress
is
constitutionally
free
to
establish
the
conditions
under
which
civil
or
criminal
proceedings
involving
federal
issues
may
be
removed
from
one
court
to
another.
while
the
right
to
free
speech
and
the
right
to
due
process
are
conferred
by
the
constitution,
the
question
of
proper
forum
is
statutory.
section
2283
has
plainly
precluded
injunctive
relief
in
the
pending
prosecution.
counsel
for
appellant
fernandez
argues
that
declaratory
relief
would
not
violate
the
statute
and
will
forward
essentially
the
same
remedy.
however,
the
rendering
of
such
relief
would
frustrate
the
purposes
of
section
2283
and
destroy
the
principles
of
comity
between
state
and
federal
courts.
and
that
in
inevitable
disruption
of
state
prosecutions
would
occur.
state
courts
have
the
same
duty
and
power
to
rule
upon
federal
constitutional
issues
in
the
same
way
as
the
federal
courts
and
in
most
cases
where
a
prosecution
is
already
pending,
less
delay
would
adhere
in
resolving
the
issues
in
the
state
courts.
if
a
statute
is
overbroad,
the
state
courts
have
the
same
power
as
the
federal
courts
to
strike
it
down,
to
prevent
any
chilling
effect
upon
first
amendment
rights.
i
think
the
federal
removal
statute
which
was
referred
to
earlier
by
mr.
justice
marshall
provides
evidence
of
congressional
intent
to
keep
cases
in
the
state
courts
where
there
are
pending
prosecutions
already
commenced.
the
removal
statute
allows
determination
of
state
proceedings
only
in
very
narrow
circumstances
and
this
provides
congressional
guidance
on
the
issue
of
declaratory
judgment.
as
the
clear
and
present
test
is
one
of
judicial
applicability
as
this
court
found
in
dennis
versus
united
states,
the
application
of
this
statute
to
appellants
can
only
be
determined
upon
a
full
record
in
the
state
courts.
the
need
for
such
a
record
supplies
a
further
ground
for
non-intervention
in
this
case.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
i
please
the
court.
this
court
recently
had
occasion
to
examine
and
analyze
section
2283,
the
anti-injunction
statute
in
atlanta
coast
line
railroad
versus
brotherhood
of
locomotive
engineers.
and
although
this
court
was
dealing
there
with
the
necessary
and
effectuation
of
jurisdiction
clause
rather
than
a
authorized
statutory
exception
clause,
the
courts
general
comments
on
the
statute
are
very
pertinent
to
the
case
here
today.
this
court
said
that
2283
is
not
merely
a
rule
of
committee.
it
is
a
biding
rule
on
the
power
of
the
federal
courts
and
that
even
if
general
equitable
principles
as
interventions
are
satisfied
which
are
clearly
not
in
this
case,
the
federal
courts
may
not
intervene
in
a
pending
case
unless
one
of
the
statutory
exceptions
is
involved.
and
mr.
justice
black
further
commented
that
these
statutory
exceptions
should
not
be
enlarged
by
loose
construction.
it
has
already
been
shown
that
section
1983
can
not
be
an
expressly
authorized
exception
to
2283.
in
fact,
not
only
is
there
nothing
in
the
statute
that
so
indicate,
but
the
section
creates
no
substantive
rights,
it
merely
refers
to
rights
already
granted
by
other
statutes
and
by
the
constitution.
thus,
it
is
clear
that
suits
under
1983
can
not
result
in
injunctions
against
state
court
proceedings.
now
appellant
fernandez
argues
that
declaratory
judgment
may
still
issue.
there
is
an
irony
in
this
argument
because
what
it
really
means
is
that
if
a
state
official
is
conscientious
and
he
wishes
to
abide
by
a
federal
court
declaration,
then
a
state
a
state
proceeding
will
be
disrupted,
a
statutory
scheme
nullified.
however,
if
a
state
official
is
not
conscientious,
he
may
continue
with
the
state
proceeding
through
the
usual
appellate
review
and
finally
to
this
court.
now
this
kind
of
penalty
can
not
possibly
have
been
a
congressional
intent
in
enacting
2383.
quite
the
contrary,
its
intent
was
very
clearly
to
prevent
this
kind
of
disruption
of
state
court
proceedings.
now
appellant
--
one
of
the
appellants
stated
that
it
is
illogical
to
distinguish
between
pending
proceedings
and
future
proceedings.
but
this
is
precisely
what
congress
did
in
enacting
the
anti-junction
law.
it
made
that
distinction
because
it
wanted
to
avoid
disruption
of
proceedings
already
commenced.
this
morning,
it
was
suggested
by
counsel
warren
that
once
a
court
had
jurisdiction,
it
could
issue
a
declaratory
judgment
and
if
that
were
not
obeyed,
an
injunction
could
issue
to
effectuate
the
judgment.
in
other
words,
what
he
was
suggesting
was
that
a
two
step
procedure
could
be
used
instead
of
one
step.
now
this
obviously
would
make
unnecessary
the
list
of
exceptions
in
2283
and
in
fact
it
would
make
a
joke
of
2283
because
it
would
merely
mean
that
you
could
accomplish
in
two
steps
what
the
statute
on
its
face
says
you
may
not
accomplish
in
one
step.
it
should
be
pointed
out
that
state
courts
have
both
the
power
and
the
duty
to
rule
upon
federal
constitutional
issues
in
the
same
way
as
a
federal
court.
and
if
a
statute
is
overbroad,
state
courts
have
the
same
power
to
strike
it
down
to
prevent
any
chilling
effect
on
first
amendment
rights.
there
would
be
no
reason
therefore
to
deprive
the
state
courts
of
jurisdiction
over
such
pending
proceedings
and
absolutely
no
basis
for
any
a
priori
assumption
that
such
state
courts
would
be
less
willing
or
less
able
to
protect
rights
originating
in
the
constitution.
congress
has
provided
in
the
federal
removal
statute
for
the
narrow
class
of
cases
in
which
such
judicial
protection
can
not
be
expected.
now
the
cases
at
bar
furthermore,
would
be
unlikely
candidates
for
the
articulation
of
any
new
rule
respecting
declaratory
intervention
since
they
did
not
involve
any
raise
to
the
courthouse
door.
there
was
obviously
no
evidence
of
any
bad
faith
prosecution
and
no
effect
upon
first
amendment
rights.
counsel
for
appellants
has
said
that
there
is
no
abstention
problem
here.
as
mr.
justice
stewart
earlier
pointed
out,
this
court
has
differentiated
non-intervention
from
abstention
and
for
this
reason
in
zwickler
versus
koota
said
that
it
gave
continuing
validity
to
the
principle
of
non-intervention.
there
is
a
difference
between
a
plaintiff
having
his
choice
of
forum
and
a
defendant
in
a
state
proceeding
when
the
tide
is
turned
against
him
wishing
to
come
in
to
the
federal
court
to
disrupt
that
proceeding.
now
counsel
for
appellant
samuels
in
his
brief
suggest
on
the
merits
of
his
case
that
the
clear
and
present
danger
test
which
this
court
approved
in
dennis
be
overruled.
he
hasn't
suggested
any
substitute
test
and
apparently
it's
position
that
speech
can
not
create
the
kind
of
danger
which
the
state
has
a
right
to
prevent
no
matter
what
the
context
or
circumstances
of
that
speech
is.
but
this
court
has
repeatedly
noted
using
the
example
of
the
man
shutting
fire
in
a
crowded
theater
that
something
which
is
pure
speech
can
create
a
physical
danger.
and
so
the
question
is
the
circumstances
and
the
context
of
that
speech.
now
counsel
for
appellant
fernandez
referred
to
pamphlets
and
writings.
but
even
looking
at
these
writings,
they
are
far
from
abstract
intellectual
discussion
of
doctrine,
but
instead
they
sent
it
around
organizing
youth
for
acts
of
violence,
how
to
put
together
gun
powder
and
other
materials
for
the
making
of
bombs
and
proficiency
in
terror
tactics.
these
were
the
writings
that
were
involved.
another
point
was
made
that
the
kind
of
riots
which
you
saw
described
in
the
epton
case
do
not
constitute
overthrow
of
the
government.
i
think
this
is
very
unrealistic
and
naive
theory
because
there
are
many
ways
to
overthrow
government
and
only
one
of
them
is
a
replacement
of
one
group
of
government
officials
by
another
group
of
government
officials.
that
is
one
kind
of
overthrow.
but
another
kind
of
overthrow
very
clearly
is
the
paralysis
of
a
government
system
and
in
new
york
city
for
example,
the
cutting
off
of
electrical
power,
the
sabotage
of
transportation
lines,
attacks
on
the
police
make
it
impossible
for
the
government
to
render
essential
government
services.
and
this
is
as
much
an
overthrow
as
is
the
replacement
of
particular
people,
and
in
fact
it
also
creates
a
kind
of
chaos
which
prevents
government
from
operating
effectively.
appellants
also
claim
that
the
statute
at
issue
will
have
a
deterrent
effect
upon
the
advocacy
of
unpopular
ideas,
but
analysis
indicate
there
can
be
no
such
deterrents
in
this
case.
prosecutions
under
both
the
old
and
the
new
statutes
which
are
called
the
criminal
anarchy
statute
here
must
be
governed
by
the
rules
set
down
in
epton
and
that
decision
made
it
very
clear
that
mere
abstract
advocacy
of
doctrine
is
outside
the
ambit
of
the
statute.
and
therefore,
outside
the
ambit
of
any
prosecution
both
this
one
and
future
prosecutions
therefore,
the
only
ground
whose
rights
might
be
affected
--
might
not
be
affected
by
the
epton
decision
would
be
a
hypothetical
group
which
was
deterred
before
the
epton
decision.
however,
this
group
can
not
be
prosecuted
for
their
activities
because
the
prosecution
places
the
advocation
of
unpopular
ideas
and
such
the
mere
advocation
of
unpopular
ideas
outside
the
statutes
ambit.
and
therefore
this
hypothetical
group
can
not
be
prosecuted
and
for
that
matter
can
not
even
be
identified.
and
this
kind
of
controversy
with
an
unidentified
group
of
these
type
which
can
not
be
prosecuted
obviously
presents
no
live
grievance
under
this
courts
decision
in
golden
versus
zwickler.
so,
that
we
have
here
a
pending
prosecution
and
obviously
no
possible
effect
upon
appellant's
first
amendment
rights.
thank
you.
