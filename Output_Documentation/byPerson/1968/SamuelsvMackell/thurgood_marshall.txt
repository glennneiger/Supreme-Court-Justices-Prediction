mr.
ludwig,
if
they've
got
these
rifles
and
they're
going
to
overthrow
the
government,
is
it
an
assumption
they'd
shoot
somebody,
wouldn't
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i'm
not
interested
in
any
test
run.
i'm
not
interested
in
anything
but
the
indictment
in
this
case
and
the
pleadings
in
this
case.
couldn't
you
have
indicted
them
for
the
possession
of
the
carbines
for
the
purpose
of
harming
somebody,
period?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
you're
really
doing
using
the
criminal
syndicalism
statute
to
enforce
the
possession
statute?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
certainly
the
criminal
syndicalism
statute
wasn't
intended
for
that
in
any
time,
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
what
i'm
saying.
you
said
you
drafted
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
you
have
that
in
mind?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
have
in
mind
combined
it
with
the
criminal
syndicalism
of
the
statute?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
mean
not
at
all,
is
that
true?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
meant
what
you
said
was
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
thought
maybe
you
might
have
meant
you
said
a
minute
ago
that
it
was
specifically
the
end
of
some
specific
course.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
my
only
point
is
that
what
you
need
to
prove
the
case
is
one
thing,
and
what
you
put
in
the
indictment
is
another.
and
you
admit
that
the
only
way
to
convict
these
people
for
the
possession
of
these
guns
is
by
the
criminal
syndicalism
statute,
is
that
your
position?
justice
thurgood
marshall
didn't
professor
amsterdam
also
said
that
was
the
reason
for
the
removal
of
the
statute?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what?
do
you
think
they
are
--
you
have
two
chances
to
get
into
federal
court?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
not
done
by
what
congress
made?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
that
would
leave
it
up
to
the
choice
if
the
person
involved
as
to
whether
he
wanted
removal
or
whether
he
wanted
an
injunction?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
if
he
had
removal,
it
would
just
involve
that
one
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
can
see
a
considerable
reason
between
enjoining
the
prosecution
willy-nilly
and
saying
that
we
will
try
it
at
a
different
court.
one
is,
the
man
goes
free.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
in
this
type
of
case
if
you
win
in
the
federal
court
the
government
can
--
the
state
cannot
try
the
man?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
think
1983
says
a
little
more
than
that
because
i
would
assume
that
every
arrest
is
--
by
an
officer
acting
under
state
law,
i
would
assume.
justice
thurgood
marshall
he

his
federal
rights

justice
thurgood

i
thought
this
was
it.
justice
thurgood

i
didn't
say
it
was
an
alternate.
i
wanted
to
know
whether
it
was
or
not.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
our
considerations
a
little
changed
--
was
on
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
aren't
conditions
change
since
when
1983
was
adopted
and
today?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
mean
for
example
in
this
case,
there's
a
possibility
that
these
people
will
be
tried
before
a
negro
judge
and
only
negro
judge.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it's
not
possible?
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
you
agree
that
in
order
for
congress
to
do
that,
they'd
have
to
repeal
1983?
justice
thurgood

yes.
