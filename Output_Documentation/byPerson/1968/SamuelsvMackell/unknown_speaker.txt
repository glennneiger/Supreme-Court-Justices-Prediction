isn't
this
a
pending
proceeding,
mr.
rabinowitz?
unknown

there
was
an
indictment
and
there
was
a
good
deal
of
publicity
at
the
time.
unknown
speaker
do
you
have
in
mind
the
statistics
as
to
the
increase
in
three-judge
federal
district
court
cases
over
the
last
very
few
years?
unknown
speaker
the
administrative
office
of
the
united
states
courts
would
presume
the
answers.
unknown
speaker
it
is
--
that's
a
little
bit
of
inaccurate
wording
isn't
it?
we
are
relegating
plaintiffs
to
the
state
court
remedies.
your
plaintiffs
have
been
brought
before
state
courts
as
defendants
in
criminal
cases.
unknown
speaker
this
isn't
a
matter
of
relegating
a
plaintiff
to
one
court
or
another
as
a
plaintiff.
unknown
speaker
you
of
course
asked
for
an
injunction
in
the
brief?
unknown
speaker
had
you
asked
only
for
a
declaratory
judgment
--
unknown
speaker
there
would
not
have
been
a
three-judge
court,
would
there?
unknown
speaker
then
there
wouldn't
have
been
an
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
you
are
now
saying
that
you
really
perhaps
shouldn't
have
asked
for
an
injunction
at
all.
that's
pretty
hard
for
a
judge
--
unknown
speaker
well
that
is
pretty
long,
far
along
the
path
if
you'd
really
be
pleased.
