justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
the
narrowing
construction
that
the
court
gave
the
statute
to
epton
meets
the
constitutional
problem?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
a
crime
in
new
york?
you
made
a
crime
in
that
language?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
a
crime
to
have
it
with
intent
to
overthrow
the
government?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
that
language?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
what
then?
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
use
the
same
unlawfully?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
what
law
would
it
bother?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
say
unlawful,
now
which
one
is
that
statute?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
does
it
say?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i'm
talking
about
beyond
that,
whereas
anything
it
said
that
would
be
unlawful?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
what
does
it
say?
justice
hugo
l.
black
a
question
of
advocate?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
explained
to
justice
harlan
awhile
ago
but
i
didn't
quite
understand
you.
how
long
ago
was
that
judgment
rendered?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
there
was
no
injunction?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
explain
that
i
think
why
the
state
hadn't
prosecuted
it,
i
didn't
get
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
didn't
you
prosecute
them
all?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
are
the
charges
against
the
others?
justice
hugo
l.
black
conspiracy
to
commit
murder
in
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
there
has
been
no
injunction
and
yet
the
state
has
held
it
up
without
any
prosecution,
is
that
right?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
were
the
other
charges?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
many
weapons
were
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
41
weapons.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
were
charged
with
having
them
in
contrary
to
the
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
do
not
fully
understand
why
they
were
not
prosecuted.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
would
you
have
to
separate
them?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
you
could've
gotten
more
indictments,
couldn't
you,
if
that's
your
trouble?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
there
has
been
a
resource
and
you
don't
think
it
was
illegal.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
why?
justice
hugo
l.
black
those
were
serious
crimes
that
they
are
guilty?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
add
just
one
thing
your
honor,
one
of
my
assistants,
i
have
no
reason
to
know
why
a
greater
privilege
to
use
force
is
allowed
when
political
dissent
is
involved
then
for
example
in
self-defense
or
defense
of
another
or
defense
of
your
habitation.
