justice
abe
fortas
are
you
coming
back
to
the
jurisdictional
question
that
dombrowski
point?
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
talking
about
the
point
discussed
by
in
judge
friendly's
opinion
and
the
question
whether
dombrowski
author
--
dombrowski
or
any
other
decision
of
this
court
in
fact
authorizes
a
maintenance
of
this
action?
justice
abe
fortas
i
just
want
to
--
i
just
invite
you
to
discuss
it
if
you
see
fit.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
is
it
your
position
that
anytime
people
are
prosecuted
or
indicted
and
under
indictment
in
a
state
on
account
of
a
conduct
that
lies
within
the
broad
first
amendment
area.
that
is
to
say
any
kind
of
protest
activity
that
a
three-judge
federal
court
has
jurisdiction
to
consider
the
issuance
of
a
declaratory
judgment
under
dombrowski?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
all
you
have
to
show
then
is
that
the
people
have
been
indicted
by
state
and
that
the
indictment
relates
to
conduct
within
the
broad
area
of
speech.
justice
abe
fortas
no,
that's
to
get
relief.
i'm
talking
about
jurisdiction.
is
that
what
dombrowski
means
to
you?
justice
abe
fortas
so
what
are
the
exceptions
of
the
qualifications?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
could
you
suggest
to
me
a
first
amendment
situation
which
would
not
fall
within
that
category?
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
to
be
a
political
activity?
justice
abe
fortas
why
is
that?
is
that
because
the
chilling
for
example
of
artistic
expression
or
literally
expression
is
less
important?
justice
abe
fortas
then
that
would
make
the
difference.
justice
abe
fortas
as
purely
a
state
law
question
isn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
may
i
ask
you
what
the
present
status
of
the
prosecution
is?
has
it
been
stayed
in
any
of
this?
justice
abe
fortas
do
you
have
anything
further
to
say
with
respect
to
the
jurisdictional
point,
the
dombrowski
point?
justice
abe
fortas
i'd
--
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
you
would
--
you
would
then
make
no
restriction
as
to
the
use
of
the
injunction
and
declaratory
remedy
in
any
first
amendment
prosecution.
justice
abe
fortas
well
let's
suppose,
i
know
it's
not
the
fact,
but
let
us
suppose
for
the
moment
that
your
client
as
well
as
some
of
the
others
here
had
been
indicted
among
other
things
for
the
unlawful
possession
of
weapons.
and
their
defense
is
that
they
possess
some
sounds
of
weapons
in
order
to
protect
their
first
amendment
rights.
now,
do
you
think,
and
let's
suppose
that
you
wanted
to
test
whether
that
statue
is
unconstitutional
being
too
broad
or
what
not?
would
declaratory
judgment
or
injunctive
remedy
be
available
to
you?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
let's
assume
that
everybody
agrees
that
these
people
did
posses
themselves
of
rifles
and
pistols
and
in
violation
of
the
state
statute,
and
that
they
did
so
because
they
thought
that
was
necessary
in
order
to
protect
their
first
amendment
rights.
do
you
believe
that
the
district
court
would
be
proceeding
properly
to
entertain
an
action
for
declaratory
judgment
or
injunction,
assuming
that
these
people
had
been
indicted
under
that
statute?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
assume
--
assume
that
it's
an
invalid
state
statute,
assume
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
it's
too
broad
or
what
not,
assume
that.
justice
abe
fortas
in
other
words
--
well
that's
what
i
was
getting
at.
in
other
words,
as
i
understand
your
position,
declaratory
judgment
and
suit
for
injunction
in
a
federal
court
lie
with
respect
to
any
state
statute
and
any
indictment
provided
that
the
defense
--
provided
that
it
is
asserted
or
that
the
defense
is
that
the
activity
involved
is
within
the
broad
first
amendment
area?
that's
your
position.
justice
abe
fortas
alright.
justice
abe
fortas
but
as
i
--
as
i
understand
it,
one
of
the
points
that
judge
friendly
made
below
is
that
you
ought
to
wait
until
there
is
some
judgment
in
the
criminal
action,
and
then
prosecute
the
accused.
justice
abe
fortas
i
can
imagine.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i'm
interested
that
you're
sure
of
that,
and
we
would
abstain
the
cause
of
the
concurrent
sentence
rule.
justice
abe
fortas
the
state
of
new
york
has
statutes
on
unlawful
possession
of
firearms
and
ammunition,
i
suppose?
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
so
were
these
people
indicted
under
those
sections?
justice
abe
fortas
but
they
were
also
indicted
for
the
advocacy
of
something,
were
they
anarchy
or
overthrowing
the
government
and
they
were
indicted
for
some
of
the
overt
acts
charged
to
them,
or
holding
meetings
to
discuss
that
and
so
on,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
true
in
the
case
of
both
these
appellants?
of
all
of
these
appellants,
is
it
true
in
fernandez's
case?
justice
abe
fortas
i
gathered
from
counsel
that
she
said
her
client
was
not
involved
in
that.
justice
abe
fortas
may
i
ask
you
whether
that's
the
federal
court
proceedings
that
have
held
us
up,
or
is
it
this
error
--
would
the
proceedings
have
been
delayed
in
any
event?
justice
abe
fortas
why
is
that?
no
injunction
status.
justice
abe
fortas
i
see.
so
it's
not
because
of
a
stay
issued
by
the
district
court
over
by
this
court?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
what's
the
part
of
the
statute
on
which
you
rely,
go
back
to
page
2
of
your
brief,
because
as
i
read
that
it
says,
“such
person
shall
not
be
deemed
to
have
lost
a
residence
or
domicile
in
his
state
solely
by
reason
of
being
absent
there
from
the
compliance
of
military
orders,
or
to
have
acquired
a
residence
or
domicile
in
the
other
state.”
now,
is
somewhere
in
that
part
of
the
statute,
do
you
find
this
court
for
your
position?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
that's
not
applicable
here,
would
you
agree?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
what's
the
other
one?
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
of
any
such
person.
justice
abe
fortas
which
indicates
property,
personal
property
owned
by
the
person,
doesn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
just
reading
that
plainly
in
a
common
place
manner,
it
does
seem
to
support
the
state's
position
rather
than
yours,
doesn't
it?
in
other
words,
you
have
--
your
position
has
to
depend
upon
doing
a
little
magic
with
the
words,
doesn't
it
in
taking
what
you
deem
to
be
the
sense
of
the
provision
rather
than
its
specific
language?
justice
abe
fortas
no,
but
the
use
tax
in
this
sense,
as
i
understand
it
is
a
sales
--
it's
a
part
of
the
sales
tax
in
the
sense
that
it
is
a
complimentary
to
the
sales
tax
for
the
purpose
of
trying
to
plug
what
would
otherwise
be
an
obvious
hole
under
the
sales
tax.
justice
abe
fortas
isn't
that
the
kind
of
use
tax
we're
talking
about
here?
justice
abe
fortas
well
no,
not
necessarily.
that
is
to
say
you
couldn't
have
a
transaction
in
connecticut,
i've
had
some
in
which
there's
no
transfer
of
physical
possession
what
the
sales
tax
is
collecting.
justice
abe
fortas
but
which
we're
mostly
talking
about
here
i
suppose
is
food
and
drink.
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that,
but
how
about
is
it
stipulated
here
--
i
noticed
it
stipulated
at,
at
least
i
think
i
remember
it's
stipulated
that
no
attempt
would
be
made
that
there
is
no
opposition
to
the
collection
of
the
sales
tax
with
respect
to
groceries
bought
in
a
grocery
store
in
new
london
for
example
by
a
soldier.
what
about
that?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
is
it
the
government's
position
that
when
a
soldier
goes
into
a
store
in
new
london
to
buy
a
pack
of
cigarettes
that
he's
exempt
from
the
sales
tax?
justice
abe
fortas
no,
i'm
talking
about
the
sales
tax
on
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
on
a
pack
of
cigarettes.
justice
abe
fortas
alright.
justice
abe
fortas
that's
what
i
thought
and
in
short
that
your
position
is
that
the
sales
tax
ought
not
to
be
collected
on
the
purchase
of
toothpaste
by
a
soldier
from
the
store?
justice
abe
fortas
are

with
respect
to
groceries
bought
in
a
grocery
store
in
new
london
for
example
by
a
soldier.
what
about
that?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
is
it
the
government's
position
that
when
a
soldier
goes
into
a
store
in
new
london
to
buy
a
pack
of
cigarettes
that
he's
exempt
from
the
sales
tax?
justice
abe
fortas
no,
i'm
talking
about
the
sales
tax
on
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
on
a
pack
of
cigarettes.
justice
abe
fortas
alright.
justice
abe
fortas
that's
what
i
thought
and
in
short
that
your
position
is
that
the
sales
tax
ought
not
to
be
collected
on
the
purchase
of
toothpaste
by
a
soldier
from
the
store?
