justice

j.
brennan,

so
it
wasn't
schipani
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
wasn't
schipani
a
case
where
the
government
came
forward
and
said,
yes,
we
were
frankly
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
illegal
bugging.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
here,
the
finding
of
illegal
bugging
is
against
you,
and
that's
where
it
went
down
to
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
try
the
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
tell
you,
mr.
glasser.
i
don't
think
i
quite
understand
this.
what
is
this
order
you're
talking
about,
an
authorization?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
what's
the
significance
of
all
this
with
his
conviction?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
if
it
did?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
what
do
you
mean
usurpational?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
wait,
you're
ahead
of
me.
what
do
you
mean,
usurpational
of
what?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
perhaps
i
understand
it
now.
this
is
an
argument
independent
of
your
fourth
amendment
argument.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
you're
really
saying,
mr.
beytagh,
as
i
understand
it,
is
that
on
your
submission
the
katz
rule
would
apply
only
to
actual
buggings
after
the
date
that
katz
was
decided?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and,
for
that
reason,
i
gather
you'd
come
out
to
affirm
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
say
that
these
petitioners
are
not
entitled
to
the
benefit
of
the
katz.
only
katz
was
entitled.
it
would
soon
effect
what
we
said
in
stovall
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
about
gilbert
and
williams,
wasn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
say
--
but
it'
--
it
says
bugging
--
but
katz
got
the
benefit
of
the
rule
which
was
laid
down
for
the
first
time,
i
gather,
in
huston.
i
know
that
it's
not
mr.
glasser's
position
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
the
government's
position.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
katz
laid
down
a
new
rule,
and
you
say
that
new
rule
should
apply
only
on
the
buggings
after
the
date
that
katz
was
decided?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see,
but
i
suppose
maybe
the
answer
is
that
linkletter
and
johnson
both,
because
i
should
think
this
would
apply
not
only
to
the
fourth
amendment
but
the
fifth
as
well,
wouldn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and,
to
the
extent
that
those
cases
gave
the
benefit
of
the
new
rules
to
litigants
whose
cases
were
on
direct
review
as
a
practical
matter,
there
aren't
any
more
cases
on
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
they?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that,
really,
here
is,
shall
we
adopt
the
same
rule
that
we
adopted
for
linkletter
or
johnson
or
shall
we
rather,
this
being
a
new
rule,
katz
on
your
submission
being
another
new
rule,
should
we
adopt
the
test
that
we
laid
down
in
stovall,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
it
wasn't
schipani
