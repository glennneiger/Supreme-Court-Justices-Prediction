mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
a
bit
surprised
to
learn
that
petitioners
don't
feel
that
retroactivity
of
katz
is
the
question
involved
here.
now,
we
have
thought,
in
our
brief
and
in
petitioner's
brief
here
before,
this
question
has
been
briefed
extensively
and
we
have
thought
that
this
was
the
central
issue
involved
in
the
case.
i
still
think
it
is,
as
i
understand
it,
petitioner's
contention
is
that
katz
itself
somehow
decided
this
question.
now,
i
don't
quite
know
whether
that's
what
he
means
or
whether
he's
simply
saying
that
the
law
always
was
that
way
and,
in
light
of
some
suggestions
made
from
this
end
of
the
bench,
it
seems
to
me
that's
fairly
close
to
the
accepted
common
law
theory
which
the
court
in
linkletter
and
subsequent
decisions
found
it
was
not
bound
to
follow.
well,
it
seems
to
me,
that
doesn't
advance
the
inquiry
here
very
far
because
the
question
is
whether
this
is
one
of
those
situations
in
which
the
approach
taken
in
linkletter
and
in
stovall
and
johnson
and
tehan
and
several
other
cases
per
curiam
should
be
followed,
that
is,
that
a
decision
changing
a
constitutional
rule
of
criminal
procedure
should
not,
for
a
variety
of
considerations,
be
given
retroactive
effect
to
prior
cases.
i
should
mention
that
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
and,
i
think
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
the
court
has
made
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes,
your
honors,
as
i'm
sure
you're
aware
and
this
is
what
you
really
refer
to,
the
court
has
noted
this
fact
in
subsequent
cases
holding
decisions
not
to
be
retroactive
that,
in
the
linkletter
situation,
that
the
law
enforcement
officials,
in
light
of
wolf,
knew
what
they
were
doing.
the
state
officials
were
wrong,
and
they
want
it
and
did
it
and
the
court,
nonetheless,
found
that
it
was
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
but
the
reason
we
haven't
pressed
that
argument
at
length
is
that,
it
seemed
to
us,
the
katz
opinion
itself
suggested
that
it
was
not
sufficient
that
the
agent's
conduct
there
was
reasonable
and,
therefore,
we
have
not
felt
that
we
could
press
that
argument
here.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
understand.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that's
our
understanding
of
the
situation.
this
is
not
consistent
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes.
this
is
not
consistent
with
the
approach
that
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
if
katz
were
held
retroactive.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i'm
not
sure
in
what
respect
it
would
be
in
my
interest
to
distinct
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
distinguish
linkletter.
the
only
point
of
distinction
that
is
suggested
by
petitioners
is
that
in
linkletter
the
court
held
mapp
to
be,
what
he
says,
partially
retroactive,
that
is,
the
court
held
that
the
mapp
decision
would
be
applicable
to
cases
on
direct
review
at
the
time
that
mapp
was
decided
but
not
on
collateral.
now,
as
the
court
itself
pointed
out
in
the
johnson
opinion
and
again
in
the
stovall
opinion,
those
decisions
were
made
“without
discussion.”
they
were
made
in
per
curiam
decisions
without
consideration
or
reflection
or
an
opportunity
to
evaluate
and
weigh
these
arguments.
so,
we
don't
get
really
very
much
out
of
that
point.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
court
has
moved
beyond
that
in
the
evolution
and
development
of
this
doctrine
of
non-retroactivity
in
appropriate
circumstances.
now,
beyond
that,
i
can't
see
any
point
of
distinction
with
linkletter
and,
it
seems
to
me,
that
point
is
not
a
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that's
correct.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
it
seems
to
me,
that
it
has
a
pretty
direct
barring.
i
think
that
we
have,
in
our
briefs,
developed
a
sound
argument.
if
you
follow
the
analysis
that
we
do
and
not
the
alternative
analysis
that
you
suggested,
for
holding
the
katz
decision
not
to
be
retroactive.
it
seems
to
us
that
the
decision
in
fuller
which
held,
as
your
honors
know,
lee
versus
florida
non-retroactive
is
awfully
close
the
situation
that
we
have
here.
i
have
not
had
an
opportunity
to
study
this
joint
supplemental
reply
brief
that
was
filed
over
the
weekend
but,
as
i
understand
it
from
a
quick
reading,
there
are
some
discussion
there
that,
while
they
do
admit
that
--
petitioners
do
admit
that
the
fuller
decision
may
cause
them
some
difficulties,
the
suggestion
is
that,
because
a
statute
was
involved
and
not
the
fourth
amendment
and
because
a
telegram
and
not
a
telephone,
that
somehow
this
makes
it
different.
it
seems
to
me
that
what
the
court
said
in
fuller
was
that
all
of
the
considerations
that
have
been
developed
in
the
previous
cases
are
applicable
in
this
situation.
the
purpose,
it
said,
is
to
enforce
a
federal
law,
purpose
is
delineated
in
the
linkletter
opinion
of
the
fourth
amendment
exclusionary
rule,
of
course
katz
is
a
fourth
amendment
case
and
developed
some
exclusionary
rule
itself,
is
to
deter
police
from
acting
in
an
unconstitutional
matter.
and,
it's
clear
that
if
that's
the
purpose,
that
purpose
can't
be
served
by
retroactively
invalidating
convictions
that
have
been
based
upon
evidence
obtained
which,
under
the
new
rule,
would
have
been
inadmissible.
so,
i
think
that
the
fuller
case
is
quite
pertinent.
i
think
that
all
the
analysis
applied
there
is
applicable
here
and,
it
seems
to
me,
that
confirms
the
approach
that
we
have
suggested
to
be
taken
to
the
retroactivity
clause.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
i
like
you
saying
that
the
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that
the
problem
with
it
for
me,
quite
honestly,
is
that
schwartz
was
on
the
books
and
it
maybe
said
that
they
also
could
be
charge
with
having
knowledge
of
that.
so,
i'm
not
sure
that
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
this
schwartz
case
was
also
on
the
books,
so
holding
the
statute
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no,
i
understand.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think,
adding
to
that
point,
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
although
petitioners
appear
to
dispute,
i
don't
know
how
they
have
the
information.
i
frankly
don't
have
the
information,
but
it's
not
all
together
clear
that
if
the
agents
had
known
what
the
law
was
going
to
be,
that
they
would
not
have
been
able
here
to
get
a
warrant.
they
followed,
as
far
as
we
can
tell,
in
the
concurrent
findings
of
both
courts
below.
it
seems
to
me,
it
refute
the
suggestion
made
that
this
court
ought
to
somehow
seek
to
overturn
these
findings
in
this
evidence.
the
courts
below
both
found
that
the
installation
was
made
without
physical
intrusion
into
a
constitutionally
protected
area,
under
the
goldman-silverman
distinction.
now,
it
seems
to
us
that
the
reason
the
agents
want
about
it
--
doing
that
way
was
because
of
the
very
reason
that
they
were
trying
to
comply
with
the
law
as
they
understood
it.
now,
whether
they
could've
gotten
a
warrant
or
not
had
they
known
that
katz
was
going
to
be
decided
and
required
a
warrant,
i
don't
know.
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
there's
a
case
called
pardo-bolland
versus
united
states.
it
was
decided
by
the
second
circuit
and
in
which
certiorari
was
denied
by
this
court
just
prior
to
be
installation
at
the
waldorf
in
this
case.
that
case
involved
a
virtually
identical
installation,
the
microphone
adjacent
to
an
opening
in
a
door
between
hotel
rooms
but
not
at
all
penetrating
into
or
under
the
door.
it
seems
to
us
that,
as
i
indicated
earlier,
that
all
of
the
considerations
that
the
court
has
developed
applicable
in
deciding
whether
a
case
should
be
retroactively
applied
and
none
are
pertinent
here.
i
discussed
purpose.
we
discussed
it
at
--
briefly
the
question
of
reliance.
it
seems
to
me,
it's
quite
clear
that
the
agents
here
did
rely
and
that
other
agents
have
relied
on
the
goldman-silverman
distinction.
katz,
now,
requires
that
they
get
a
warrant.
if
we
accept
the
findings
that
the
installation
here
was
not
trespassory
and,
it
seems
to
me,
that
it
was
lawful
under
the
law
that
existed,
and
because
they
relied
upon
that
law
and
because
other
agents
in
similar
installations
have
obviously
relied
on
it,
there's
every
reason
to
maintain
that
that
factor
argues
in
favor
of
non-retroactivity.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i'm
not
quite
sure
that
i
understand
the
question.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
to
conduct
--
to
con
--
yes,
sir.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
it
leaves
very
little
room,
your
honor,
as
we
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
i
just
question
what
their
case
is
--
is
precisely
our
--
our
view
of
stovall
is
that,
at
the
time
of
the
conduct
as
compared
with
the
time
of
the
decision,
any
conduct
occurring
thereafter.
now,
in
the
destefano
case
which
involved
non-retroactivity
of
jury
trial,
the
court
necessarily
related
that
to
trials
commenced,
but
the
only
way
that
you
can
apply
it
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
in
stovall.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
katz
and,
of
course,
any
people
bugged
subsequent
to
katz
to
which
the
rule
applies.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
and
that's
entirely
consistent
with
stovall
and
reflective
of
what
stovall
suggested
about
the
reasons
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i'm
not
sure
that
it
overrules
linkletter
if
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
in
link
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
i
take
it
you
mean
vitality
in
respect
of
making
a
distinction
between
--
yes.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
that's
right.
i
think
it
still
has
vitality
in
respect
of
deciding
that,
as
a
general
matter,
fourth
amendment
decisions
are
not
necessarily
applicable
retroactively.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
so.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
as
a
practical
matter
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
it's
doubtful
that
there
are
any.
linkletter
was
the
now
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that's
correct,
although
johnson
is
much
closer
to
stovall
than
--
tehan,
the
second
case
in
linkletter,
did
the
same
thing.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
johnson
moved
beyond
that
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
and
made
that
commencement
of
the
date
--
the
commencement
of
trial
in
which
the
confession
is
introduced
applicable,
and
then
stovall
focused
upon
the
conduct,
as
justice
harlan
has
pointed
out.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
don't
think
it's
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that's
correct,
but
i
see
--
it
seems
to
me,
there's
no
compulsion
involved
here.
it's
been
suggested
that
somehow
this
is
an
involuntary
confession.
we
don't
quite
understand
that.
i
don't
know
that
he
was
compelled
to
do
anything.
i
would
like
to
turn
just
for
a
moment
to
the
--
his
repeated
references
to
the
president's
directive
of
june
13,
1965.
petitioners
have
referred
to
this
repeatedly.
the
only
reason
that
it
has
not
been
made
public
is
that
it
was
specifically
indicated
by
the
white
house
that
it
should
be
an
internal
government
matter
and
kept
confidential.
all
of
us
who
have
worked
with
these
series
of
cases,
schipani
and
black
and
whatever
in
this
case,
and
the
attorney
general
in
promulgating
the
directives
that
he
is
promulgated
are
completely
familiar
with
what
the
directive
says
and
what
it
requires.
in
the
main,
it
discusses
wire
tapping.
it
discusses
electronic
surveillance
only
in
a
short
and
passing
way,
and
simply
directs
that
the
attorney
general
and
the
other
agencies
be
ensured
that
the
federal
government
and
all
of
its
agencies
are
acting
in
compliance
with
the
existing
law.
now,
we've
acted
consistently
on
that
basis.
we
have
informed
the
court
in
any
situations
involving
trespassory
bugging
and,
it
seems
to
us,
that
the
whole
things
has
much
to
do
about
nothing
and,
it
seems
to
me,
inconceivable
that
the
attorney
general
and
the
solicitor
general,
the
department
of
justice,
indeed
the
whole
federal
law
enforcement
establishment
would've
acted
all
these
time
inconsistent
and
in
conflict
with
the
presidential
directive.
it's
simply
not
so,
and
i
don't
know
what
else
really
can
be
said
about
it.
i
would
like
to
turn
to
several
of
the
arguments
made
by
petitioner
that
are
really
subsidiary
in
nature.
one
of
them
is,
he
views
it
as
a
fairly
important
argument,
he
says
that
even
if
you
hold
katz
to
be
retroact
--
non-retroactive
so
that
the
katz
does
not
apply
to
his
case,
the
bugging
here
was
in
violation
of
existing
law.
but,
we
don't
quite
understand
that.
he
seeks
to
get
something
out
of
the
osborne
case.
the
osborne
case,
in
the
first
place,
was
decided
after
the
bugging
occurred
here
but,
more
importantly,
in
osborne,
all
that
--
as
we
understand
the
court
to
have
done
was
to
say
that
it
was
unnecessary
to
wrestle
with
the
question
of
whether
lopez
was
still
good
law
because
in
the
osborne
situation
there
was
judicial
sanction
for
the
recording
which
is,
as
your
honors
recall,
was
what
was
involved
there
of
a
conversation
engaged
in
by
the
defendant
and
another
person.
so,
it
seems
to
me
that
osborne
doesn't
advance
the
inquiry
anyway.
he
suggested
somehow
silverman
decided
all
of
these.
well,
in
silverman,
the
court
specifically
refused
to
reconsider
the
question
of
whether
goldman
and
olmstead
were
still
good
law
and
found
it
unnecessary
to
do
so
because
it
found
a
physical
intrusion
there
and
the
court,
of
course,
has,
as
your
honors
know,
concluded
that
it
would
not
extend
to
goldman
even
by
a
fraction
of
an
inch.
but,
it
seems
to
us
that
it's
quite
clear
that
the
court
was
still
talking
in
terms
of
his
trespass
distinction
in
silverman.
now,
further,
it
seems
to
me,
indication
that
the
law
that
existed
prior
to
katz
was
as
we
say
it
was.
all
of
the
courts
--
lower
courts
understood
it
to
be
this
way.
we've
cited
a
number
of
court
of
appeals
decisions
would
seek
to
apply
this
distinction.
we
cited
them
“e.g.”
because
there
are
many
more.
and,
in
these,
the
court
denied
certiorari.
all
these,
occurring
during
the
time
prior
to
katz,
but
in
the
berger
case
itself
in
which
the
court
decided
that
new
york's
dropping
statute
was
not
sufficiently
precise
and
definite
to
be
upheld
constitutionally.
the
court
there
said
in
its
opinion,
repeatedly
referred
to
trespassory
intrusions,
and
that
it
could
not
allow
a
statute
that
was
that
broad
and
that
sweeping
and
that
ill-defined
to
be
a
basis
for
sanctioning
trespassory
intrusions
into
constitutionally
protected
areas.
now,
that
was
written
six
months
before
katz
and
it
seems
to
us
that
it
reflected
the
court's
view
and
notion
of
existing
law
at
that
time,
and
i
can
understand
why
the
court
would
say
that
in
berger
if
that
was
in
its
understanding
of
the
law.
so,
it
seems
to
me
that
petitioners
are
off-base
when
they
suggest
that
the
activity
engaged
in
here
was
somehow
unlawful
and
that
preexisting
law,
back
to
some
point
in
time
that
i'm
not
clear
about,
already
had
presaged
the
katz's
decision.
there
are
a
variety
of
subsidiary
issues
that
petitioners
have
raised
in
the
main.
i
should
like
to
leave
them
to
our
discussion
in
the
brief,
but
i
would
like
to
make
passing
mention
of
some
of
them
because
it
seems
to
us,
in
light
of
the
court's
granting
certiorari
without
limit,
we
have
an
obligation
to
respond
to
them.
petitioner
suggests
that
the
remand
hearing
here
was
inadequate.
as
the
court
will
recall,
after
the
schipani
procedure
which
the
government
here
did
follow,
contrary
to
petitioner's
intonations,
there
was
discovered
several
other
instances
of
electronic
activity.
one,
related
to
one
--
only
one
of
the
petitioners
had
occurred
in
miami
some-four
years
before
the
bugging
here
and
it
--
he
was
not
the
subject
of
the
surveillance
but
he
was
overheard
in
a
miami
restaurant.
the
conspiracy
here
was
not
formed
until
several
months
before
the
heroin
was
discovered
and
petitioners
were
arrested.
this
conversation
had
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
the
matters
involved
here
and
was
wholly
irrelevant.
the
only
other
instance
was
in
columbus,
georgia
when
they
were
following
these
people
around
because
they
were
trying
to
make
this
transfer.
there
was
an
attempt
to
put
a
radio
transmitter
in
a
rented
car.
the
thing
didn't
work
and
they
heard
absolutely
nothing.
the
remand
hearing
was
limited
to
those
two
issues.
however,
the
judge
did
allow
petitioners
to
put
on
several
witnesses.
those
witnesses
testified
in
various
ways
that
some
kind
of
bad
things
were
happening
down
there
in
columbus,
but
when
they
were
cross-examined
they
backed
off
and,
finally,
the
court
determined
that
they
simply
weren't
credible.
other
questions
that
he
raises,
he
says
that
as
to
t
--
at
least
two
of
the
petitioners,
although
he
challenges
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
generally,
he
says
as
particularly
as
to
two,
mr.
dioguardi
and
mr.
sutera,
the
evidence
was
wholly
inadequate.
well,
it
seems
to
us,
again,
this
is
a
matter
for
lower
courts
to
resolve.
the
findings
of
fact
here,
concurred
in
by
both
courts,
are
that
the
evidence
was
adequate,
that
these
people
were
involved
in
the
conspiracy.
they
engaged
in
an
extensive
conversation
in
a
restaurant
new
york
that
was
overheard,
not
electronically,
overheard
by
agents
sitting
at
a
bar
in
which
the
clear
intendment
is
that
they
were
to
either
receive
the
narcotics
directly
or
to
be
the
agents
for
those
people
that
were
receiving
the
narcotics.
it
seems
to
us
that
that's
a
matter
for
the
court
and
the
jury
to
resolve,
and
they
resolved
it
against
petitioner,
but
he
continues
to
assert
that
it's
a
question
that
ought
to
be
resolved
up
here.
there's
a
question
raised
as
to
the
adequacy
of
how
the
tape
was
translated.
i'm
running
out
of
time
and
i'll
simply
mention
these
questions
in
passing
and
respectfully
request
the
court
to
refer
to
our
brief.
it
seems
to
us
that,
there,
the
court
gave
petitioners
more
than
enough
opportunity
to
ensure
that
an
adequate
translation
was
made
and
there
was
no
need
to
have,
as
they
have
suggested
now,
a
simultaneous
translator
that
somehow
was
listening
to
it
and
reading
it
to
the
jury.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
the
tapes
were
in
french,
that's
what
it
is.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no,
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
all
of
the
information
they
were
--
there
were
some
logs
involved
here.
the
logs
were
turned
over
to
the
judge.
the
judge
looked
at
at
all
of
them.
the
government
suggested
that
only
parts
of
the
logs
related
to
mr.
dioguardi
at
all,
any
of
his
conversations,
and
government
exhibit,
i
think
it
is
103,
was
turned
over
to
petitioners.
the
court
made
a
specific
finding
that
that
contained
all
and
the
only
overhearing
of
mr.
dioguardi
that
occurred
during
this
time.
that
was
given
to
petitioners
and
it
was
found
to
be
all
irrelevant.
and,
there
is
a
specific
finding
of
fact
by
the
district
judge
to
this
effect.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
don't
think
so.
they
haven't
up
to
now,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
the
tapes
were
scrubbed,
as
i
understand
it
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
any
record
that
was
left
that
contained
any
conversation
that
either
was
identified
as
including
mr.
dioguardi
or
it
was
questionable
of
about
--
whether
it
did
or
not
was
turned
over
to
him.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
the
determination
first
was
made
that,
under
the
approach
the
government
had
been
following,
that
there
was
nothing
in
here
that
needed
to
be
turned
over.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
was
not
satisfied
by
that
submission.
the
court
of
appeals
asked
for
the
government
to
be
more
explicit.
the
government
then
was
more
explicit
and
indicated
these
two
instances,
and
then
the
court
of
appeals
remanded
it
for
this
hearing.
the
hearing
was
conducted,
at
which
time,
the
government
turned
over
everything
to
the
judge,
suggested
to
him
that,
as
i
said,
this
one
exhibit
contained
all
of
the
material.
he
made
a
finding
to
that
effect.
it
was
turned
over
to
petitioners
and
it
proved
to
be
wholly
immaterial
and
irrelevant.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
it
was
about
four
years
before.
it
was
in
19
--
november
of
1962.
so
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
it
was
in
a
restaurant
called
casa
maria
restaurant
in
which
the
subject
of
the
surveillance
was
a
man
named
ritchie
and
this
man,
dioguardi,
apparently
frequent
to
this
restaurant.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
as
far
as
i
know,
he
did
not.
the
finding
of
fact,
as
your
honors
know,
there
was
no
printed
appendix
in
this
case.
so,
it's
a
little
bit
difficult
to
make
references,
but
the
--
in
the
appendix
to
the
petition
that
was
filed,
the
judge,
on
page
45
(a)
and
appendix
b,
made
this
finding
after
in
camera
examination
the
court
finds
that
government
exhibit
103
truly
comprises
all
those
portions
of
government
exhibits
100
and
102
in
which
any
defendant
in
this
case
was
a
participant
or
a
possible
participant.
the
court
orders
general
--
government
exhibits
100
and
102
sealed
for
appellate
review.
there
is
no
relevant
connection
between
any
of
the
remaining
material
and
any
of
the
defendants,
this
prosecution,
or
the
issues
of
this
hearing.
this
is
finding
9.
i
see
my
time
is
up
but,
your
honor,
for
the
reasons
stated,
we
submit
that
the
convictions
in
this
case
should
be
upheld
and
the
decision
below
affirmed.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
the
case
was
tried
in
1966
from
june
15
to
july
11,
i
believe,
in
1966.
the
operative
facts
occurred
in
december
of
1965
and
then
there
was
indictment,
and
the
trial
came
on
in
june
of
1966.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
was
reading,
your
honor,
from
the
only
place
that
i
know
of
that
the
findings
of
fact
of
the
district
judge
are
reprinted.
they're
in
the
petition
--
the
appendix
--
no,
your
honor,
that's
their
brief.
the
petition
for
certiorari,
page
45(a)
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
which
includes
the
district
judge's
opinion
and
findings
of
fact
and
conclusions
on
this
remand
hearing.
thank
you.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
a
bit
surprised
to
learn
that
petitioners
don't
feel
that
retroactivity
of
katz
is
the
question
involved
here.
now,
we
have
thought,
in
our
brief
and
in
petitioner's
brief
here
before,
this
question
has
been
briefed
extensively
and
we
have
thought
that
this
was
the
central
issue
involved
in
the
case.
i
still
think
it
is,
as
i
understand
it,
petitioner's
contention
is
that
katz
itself
somehow
decided
this
question.
now,
i
don't
quite
know
whether
that's
what
he
means
or
whether
he's
simply
saying
that
the
law
always
was
that
way
and,
in
light
of
some
suggestions
made
from
this
end
of
the
bench,
it
seems
to
me
that's
fairly
close
to
the
accepted
common
law
theory
which
the
court
in
linkletter
and
subsequent
decisions
found
it
was
not
bound
to
follow.
well,
it
seems
to
me,
that
doesn't
advance
the
inquiry
here
very
far
because
the
question
is
whether
this
is
one
of
those
situations
in
which
the
approach
taken
in
linkletter
and
in
stovall
and
johnson
and
tehan
and
several
other
cases
per
curiam
should
be
followed,
that
is,
that
a
decision
changing
a
constitutional
rule
of
criminal
procedure
should
not,
for
a
variety
of
considerations,
be
given
retroactive
effect
to
prior
cases.
i
should
mention
that
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
and,
i
think
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
the
court
has
made
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes,
your
honors,
as
i'm
sure
you're
aware
and
this
is
what
you
really
refer
to,
the
court
has
noted
this
fact
in
subsequent
cases
holding
decisions
not
to
be
retroactive
that,
in
the
linkletter
situation,
that
the
law
enforcement
officials,
in
light
of
wolf,
knew
what
they
were
doing.
the
state
officials
were
wrong,
and
they
want
it
and
did
it
and
the
court,
nonetheless,
found
that
it
was
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
but
the
reason
we
haven't
pressed
that
argument
at
length
is
that,
it
seemed
to
us,
the
katz
opinion
itself
suggested
that
it
was
not
sufficient
that
the
agent's
conduct
there
was
reasonable
and,
therefore,
we
have
not
felt
that
we
could
press
that
argument
here.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
understand.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that's
our
understanding
of
the
situation.
this
is
not
consistent
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes.
this
is
not
consistent
with
the
approach
that
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
if
katz
were
held
retroactive.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i'm
not
sure
in
what
respect
it
would
be
in
my
interest
to
distinct
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
distinguish
linkletter.
the
only
point
of
distinction
that
is
suggested
by
petitioners
is
that
in
linkletter
the
court
held
mapp
to
be,
what
he
says,
partially
retroactive,
that
is,
the
court
held
that
the
mapp
decision
would
be
applicable
to
cases
on
direct
review
at
the
time
that
mapp
was
decided
but
not
on
collateral.
now,
as
the
court
itself
pointed
out
in
the
johnson
opinion
and
again
in
the
stovall
opinion,
those
decisions
were
made
“without
discussion.”
they
were
made
in
per
curiam
decisions
without
consideration
or
reflection
or
an
opportunity
to
evaluate
and
weigh
these
arguments.
so,
we
don't
get
really
very
much
out
of
that
point.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
court
has
moved
beyond
that
in
the
evolution
and
development
of
this
doctrine
of
non-retroactivity
in
appropriate
circumstances.
now,
beyond
that,
i
can't
see
any
point
of
distinction
with
linkletter
and,
it
seems
to
me,
that
point
is
not
a
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that's
correct.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
it
seems
to
me,
that
it
has
a
pretty
direct
barring.
i
think
that
we
have,
in
our
briefs,
developed
a
sound
argument.
if
you
follow
the
analysis
that
we
do
and
not
the
alternative
analysis
that
you
suggested,
for
holding
the
katz
decision
not
to
be
retroactive.
it
seems
to
us
that
the
decision
in
fuller
which
held,
as
your
honors
know,
lee
versus
florida
non-retroactive
is
awfully
close
the
situation
that
we
have
here.
i
have
not
had
an
opportunity
to
study
this
joint
supplemental
reply
brief
that
was
filed
over
the
weekend
but,
as
i
understand
it
from
a
quick
reading,
there
are
some
discussion
there
that,
while
they
do
admit
that
--
petitioners
do
admit
that
the
fuller
decision
may
cause
them
some
difficulties,
the
suggestion
is
that,
because
a
statute
was
involved
and
not
the
fourth
amendment
and
because
a
telegram
and
not
a
telephone,
that
somehow
this
makes
it
different.
it
seems
to
me
that
what
the
court
said
in
fuller
was
that
all
of
the
considerations
that
have
been
developed
in
the
previous
cases
are
applicable
in
this
situation.
the
purpose,
it
said,
is
to
enforce
a
federal
law,
purpose
is
delineated
in
the
linkletter
opinion
of
the
fourth
amendment
exclusionary
rule,
of
course
katz
is
a
fourth
amendment
case
and
developed
some
exclusionary
rule
itself,
is
to
deter
police
from
acting
in
an
unconstitutional
matter.
and,
it's
clear
that
if
that's
the
purpose,
that
purpose
can't
be
served
by
retroactively
invalidating
convictions
that
have
been
based
upon
evidence
obtained
which,
under
the
new
rule,
would
have
been
inadmissible.
so,
i
think
that
the
fuller
case
is
quite
pertinent.
i
think
that
all
the
analysis
applied
there
is
applicable
here
and,
it
seems
to
me,
that
confirms
the
approach
that
we
have
suggested
to
be
taken
to
the
retroactivity
clause.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
i
like
you
saying
that
the
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that
the
problem
with
it
for
me,
quite
honestly,
is
that
schwartz
was
on
the
books
and
it
maybe
said
that
they
also
could
be
charge
with
having
knowledge
of
that.
so,
i'm
not
sure
that
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
this
schwartz
case
was
also
on
the
books,
so
holding
the
statute
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no,
i
understand.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think,
adding
to
that
point,
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
although
petitioners
appear
to
dispute,
i
don't
know
how
they
have
the
information.
i
frankly
don't
have
the
information,
but
it's
not
all
together
clear
that
if
the
agents
had
known
what
the
law
was
going
to
be,
that
they
would
not
have
been
able
here
to
get
a
warrant.
they
followed,
as
far
as
we
can
tell,
in
the
concurrent
findings
of
both
courts
below.
it
seems
to
me,
it
refute
the
suggestion
made
that
this
court
ought
to
somehow
seek
to
overturn
these
findings
in
this
evidence.
the
courts
below
both
found
that
the
installation
was
made
without
physical
intrusion
into
a
constitutionally
protected
area,
under
the
goldman-silverman
distinction.
now,
it
seems
to
us
that
the
reason
the
agents
want
about
it
--
doing
that
way
was
because
of
the
very
reason
that
they
were
trying
to
comply
with
the
law
as
they
understood
it.
now,
whether
they
could've
gotten
a
warrant
or
not
had
they
known
that
katz
was
going
to
be
decided
and
required
a
warrant,
i
don't
know.
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
there's
a
case
called
pardo-bolland
versus
united
states.
it
was
decided
by
the
second
circuit
and
in
which
certiorari
was
denied
by
this
court
just
prior
to
be
installation
at
the
waldorf
in
this
case.
that
case
involved
a
virtually
identical
installation,
the
microphone
adjacent
to
an
opening
in
a
door
between
hotel
rooms
but
not
at
all
penetrating
into
or
under
the
door.
it
seems
to
us
that,
as
i
indicated
earlier,
that
all
of
the
considerations
that
the
court
has
developed
applicable
in
deciding
whether
a
case
should
be
retroactively
applied
and
none
are
pertinent
here.
i
discussed
purpose.
we
discussed
it
at
--
briefly
the
question
of
reliance.
it
seems
to
me,
it's
quite
clear
that
the
agents
here
did
rely
and
that
other
agents
have
relied
on
the
goldman-silverman
distinction.
katz,
now,
requires
that
they
get
a
warrant.
if
we
accept
the
findings
that
the
installation
here
was
not
trespassory
and,
it
seems
to
me,
that
it
was
lawful
under
the
law
that
existed,
and
because
they
relied
upon
that
law
and
because
other
agents
in
similar
installations
have
obviously
relied
on
it,
there's
every
reason
to
maintain
that
that
factor
argues
in
favor
of
non-retroactivity.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i'm
not
quite
sure
that
i
understand
the
question.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
to
conduct
--
to
con
--
yes,
sir.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
it
leaves
very
little
room,
your
honor,
as
we
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
i
just
question
what
their
case
is
--
is
precisely
our
--
our
view
of
stovall
is
that,
at
the
time
of
the
conduct
as
compared
with
the
time
of
the
decision,
any
conduct
occurring
thereafter.
now,
in
the
destefano
case
which
involved
non-retroactivity
of
jury
trial,
the
court
necessarily
related
that
to
trials
commenced,
but
the
only
way
that
you
can
apply
it
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
in
stovall.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
katz
and,
of
course,
any
people
bugged
subsequent
to
katz
to
which
the
rule
applies.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
and
that's
entirely
consistent
with
stovall
and
reflective
of
what
stovall
suggested
about
the
reasons
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i'm
not
sure
that
it
overrules
linkletter
if
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
in
link
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
i
take
it
you
mean
vitality
in
respect
of
making
a
distinction
between
--
yes.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
that's
right.
i
think
it
still
has
vitality
in
respect
of
deciding
that,
as
a
general
matter,
fourth
amendment
decisions
are
not
necessarily
applicable
retroactively.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
so.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
as
a
practical
matter
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
it's
doubtful
that
there
are
any.
linkletter
was
the
now
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that's
correct,
although
johnson
is
much
closer
to
stovall
than
--
tehan,
the
second
case
in
linkletter,
did
the
same
thing.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
johnson
moved
beyond
that
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
and
made
that
commencement
of
the
date
--
the
commencement
of
trial
in
which
the
confession
is
introduced
applicable,
and
then
stovall
focused
upon
the
conduct,
as
justice
harlan
has
pointed
out.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
don't
think
it's
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that's
correct,
but
i
see
--
it
seems
to
me,
there's
no
compulsion
involved
here.
it's
been
suggested
that
somehow
this
is
an
involuntary
confession.
we
don't
quite
understand
that.
i
don't
know
that
he
was
compelled
to
do
anything.
i
would
like
to
turn
just
for
a
moment
to
the
--
his
repeated
references
to
the
president's
directive
of
june
13,
1965.
petitioners
have
referred
to
this
repeatedly.
the
only
reason
that
it
has
not
been
made
public
is
that
it
was
specifically
indicated
by
the
white
house
that
it
should
be
an
internal
government
matter
and
kept
confidential.
all
of
us
who
have
worked
with
these
series
of
cases,
schipani
and
black
and
whatever
in
this
case,
and
the
attorney
general
in
promulgating
the
directives
that
he
is
promulgated
are
completely
familiar
with
what
the
directive
says
and
what
it
requires.
in
the
main,
it
discusses
wire
tapping.
it
discusses
electronic
surveillance
only
in
a
short
and
passing
way,
and
simply
directs
that
the
attorney
general
and
the
other
agencies
be
ensured
that
the
federal
government
and
all
of
its
agencies
are
acting
in
compliance
with
the
existing
law.
now,
we've
acted
consistently
on
that
basis.
we
have
informed
the
court
in
any
situations
involving
trespassory
bugging
and,
it
seems
to
us,
that
the
whole
things
has
much
to
do
about
nothing
and,
it
seems
to
me,
inconceivable
that
the
attorney
general
and
the
solicitor
general,
the
department
of
justice,
indeed
the
whole
federal
law
enforcement
establishment
would've
acted
all
these
time
inconsistent
and
in
conflict
with
the
presidential
directive.
it's
simply
not
so,
and
i
don't
know
what
else
really
can
be
said
about
it.
i
would
like
to
turn
to
several
of
the
arguments
made
by
petitioner
that
are
really
subsidiary
in
nature.
one
of
them
is,
he
views
it
as
a
fairly
important
argument,
he
says
that
even
if
you
hold
katz
to
be
retroact
--
non-retroactive
so
that
the
katz
does
not
apply
to
his
case,
the
bugging
here
was
in
violation
of
existing
law.
but,
we
don't
quite
understand
that.
he
seeks
to
get
something
out
of
the
osborne
case.
the
osborne
case,
in
the
first
place,
was
decided
after
the
bugging
occurred
here
but,
more
importantly,
in
osborne,
all
that
--
as
we
understand
the
court
to
have
done
was
to
say
that
it
was
unnecessary
to
wrestle
with
the
question
of
whether
lopez
was
still
good
law
because
in
the
osborne
situation
there
was
judicial
sanction
for
the
recording
which
is,
as
your
honors
recall,
was
what
was
involved
there
of
a
conversation
engaged
in
by
the
defendant
and
another
person.
so,
it
seems
to
me
that
osborne
doesn't
advance
the
inquiry
anyway.
he
suggested
somehow
silverman
decided
all
of
these.
well,
in
silverman,
the
court
specifically
refused
to
reconsider
the
question
of
whether
goldman
and
olmstead
were
still
good
law
and
found
it
unnecessary
to
do
so
because
it
found
a
physical
intrusion
there
and
the
court,
of
course,
has,
as
your
honors
know,
concluded
that
it
would
not
extend
to
goldman
even
by
a
fraction
of
an
inch.
but,
it
seems
to
us
that
it's
quite
clear
that
the
court
was
still
talking
in
terms
of
his
trespass
distinction
in
silverman.
now,
further,
it
seems
to
me,
indication
that
the
law
that
existed
prior
to
katz
was
as
we
say
it
was.
all
of
the
courts
--
lower
courts
understood
it
to
be
this
way.
we've
cited
a
number
of
court
of
appeals
decisions
would
seek
to
apply
this
distinction.
we
cited
them
“e.g.”
because
there
are
many
more.
and,
in
these,
the
court
denied
certiorari.
all
these,
occurring
during
the
time
prior
to
katz,
but
in
the
berger
case
itself
in
which
the
court
decided
that
new
york's
dropping
statute
was
not
sufficiently
precise
and
definite
to
be
upheld
constitutionally.
the
court
there
said
in
its
opinion,
repeatedly
referred
to
trespassory
intrusions,
and
that
it
could
not
allow
a
statute
that
was
that
broad
and
that
sweeping
and
that
ill-defined
to
be
a
basis
for
sanctioning
trespassory
intrusions
into
constitutionally
protected
areas.
now,
that
was
written
six
months
before
katz
and
it
seems
to
us
that
it
reflected
the
court's
view
and
notion
of
existing
law
at
that
time,
and
i
can
understand
why
the
court
would
say
that
in
berger
if
that
was
in
its
understanding
of
the
law.
so,
it
seems
to
me
that
petitioners
are
off-base
when
they
suggest
that
the
activity
engaged
in
here
was
somehow
unlawful
and
that
preexisting
law,
back
to
some
point
in
time
that
i'm
not
clear
about,
already
had
presaged
the
katz's
decision.
there
are
a
variety
of
subsidiary
issues
that
petitioners
have
raised
in
the
main.
i
should
like
to
leave
them
to
our
discussion
in
the
brief,
but
i
would
like
to
make
passing
mention
of
some
of
them
because
it
seems
to
us,
in
light
of
the
court's
granting
certiorari
without
limit,
we
have
an
obligation
to
respond
to
them.
petitioner
suggests
that
the
remand
hearing
here
was
inadequate.
as
the
court
will
recall,
after
the
schipani
procedure
which
the
government
here
did
follow,
contrary
to
petitioner's
intonations,
there
was
discovered
several
other
instances
of
electronic
activity.
one,
related
to
one
--
only
one
of
the
petitioners
had
occurred
in
miami
some-four
years
before
the
bugging
here
and
it
--
he
was
not
the
subject
of
the
surveillance
but
he
was
overheard
in
a
miami
restaurant.
the
conspiracy
here
was
not
formed
until
several
months
before
the
heroin
was
discovered
and
petitioners
were
arrested.
this
conversation
had
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
the
matters
involved
here
and
was
wholly
irrelevant.
the
only
other
instance
was
in
columbus,
georgia
when
they
were
following
these
people
around
because
they
were
trying
to
make
this
transfer.
there
was
an
attempt
to
put
a
radio
transmitter
in
a
rented
car.
the
thing
didn't
work
and
they
heard
absolutely
nothing.
the
remand
hearing
was
limited
to
those
two
issues.
however,
the
judge
did
allow
petitioners
to
put
on
several
witnesses.
those
witnesses
testified
in
various
ways
that
some
kind
of
bad
things
were
happening
down
there
in
columbus,
but
when
they
were
cross-examined
they
backed
off
and,
finally,
the
court
determined
that
they
simply
weren't
credible.
other
questions
that
he
raises,
he
says
that
as
to
t
--
at
least
two
of
the
petitioners,
although
he
challenges
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
generally,
he
says
as
particularly
as
to
two,
mr.
dioguardi
and
mr.
sutera,
the
evidence
was
wholly
inadequate.
well,
it
seems
to
us,
again,
this
is
a
matter
for
lower
courts
to
resolve.
the
findings
of
fact
here,
concurred
in
by
both
courts,
are
that
the
evidence
was
adequate,
that
these
people
were
involved
in
the
conspiracy.
they
engaged
in
an
extensive
conversation
in
a
restaurant
new
york
that
was
overheard,
not
electronically,
overheard
by
agents
sitting
at
a
bar
in
which
the
clear
intendment
is
that
they
were
to
either
receive
the
narcotics
directly
or
to
be
the
agents
for
those
people
that
were
receiving
the
narcotics.
it
seems
to
us
that
that's
a
matter
for
the
court
and
the
jury
to
resolve,
and
they
resolved
it
against
petitioner,
but
he
continues
to
assert
that
it's
a
question
that
ought
to
be
resolved
up
here.
there's
a
question
raised
as
to
the
adequacy
of
how
the
tape
was
translated.
i'm
running
out
of
time
and
i'll
simply
mention
these
questions
in
passing
and
respectfully
request
the
court
to
refer
to
our
brief.
it
seems
to
us
that,
there,
the
court
gave
petitioners
more
than
enough
opportunity
to
ensure
that
an
adequate
translation
was
made
and
there
was
no
need
to
have,
as
they
have
suggested
now,
a
simultaneous
translator
that
somehow
was
listening
to
it
and
reading
it
to
the
jury.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
the
tapes
were
in
french,
that's
what
it
is.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no,
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
all
of
the
information
they
were
--
there
were
some
logs
involved
here.
the
logs
were
turned
over
to
the
judge.
the
judge
looked
at
at
all
of
them.
the
government
suggested
that
only
parts
of
the
logs
related
to
mr.
dioguardi
at
all,
any
of
his
conversations,
and
government
exhibit,
i
think
it
is
103,
was
turned
over
to
petitioners.
the
court
made
a
specific
finding
that
that
contained
all
and
the
only
overhearing
of
mr.
dioguardi
that
occurred
during
this
time.
that
was
given
to
petitioners
and
it
was
found
to
be
all
irrelevant.
and,
there
is
a
specific
finding
of
fact
by
the
district
judge
to
this
effect.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
don't
think
so.
they
haven't
up
to
now,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
the
tapes
were
scrubbed,
as
i
understand
it
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
any
record
that
was
left
that
contained
any
conversation
that
either
was
identified
as
including
mr.
dioguardi
or
it
was
questionable
of
about
--
whether
it
did
or
not
was
turned
over
to
him.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
the
determination
first
was
made
that,
under
the
approach
the
government
had
been
following,
that
there
was
nothing
in
here
that
needed
to
be
turned
over.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
was
not
satisfied
by
that
submission.
the
court
of
appeals
asked
for
the
government
to
be
more
explicit.
the
government
then
was
more
explicit
and
indicated
these
two
instances,
and
then
the
court
of
appeals
remanded
it
for
this
hearing.
the
hearing
was
conducted,
at
which
time,
the
government
turned
over
everything
to
the
judge,
suggested
to
him
that,
as
i
said,
this
one
exhibit
contained
all
of
the
material.
he
made
a
finding
to
that
effect.
it
was
turned
over
to
petitioners
and
it
proved
to
be
wholly
immaterial
and
irrelevant.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
it
was
about
four
years
before.
it
was
in
19
--
november
of
1962.
so
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
it
was
in
a
restaurant
called
casa
maria
restaurant
in
which
the
subject
of
the
surveillance
was
a
man
named
ritchie
and
this
man,
dioguardi,
apparently
frequent
to
this
restaurant.
mr.
francis

as
far
as
i
know,
he
did
not.
the
finding
of
fact,
as
your
honors
know,
there
was
no
printed
appendix
in
this
case.
so,
it's
a
little
bit
difficult
to
make
references,
but
the
--
in
the
appendix
to
the
petition
that
was
filed,
the
judge,
on
page
45
(a)
and
appendix
b,
made
this
finding
after
in
camera
examination
the
court
finds
that
government
exhibit
103
truly
comprises
all
those
portions
of
government
exhibits
100
and
102
in
which
any
defendant
in
this
case
was
a
participant
or
a
possible
participant.
the
court
orders
general
--
government
exhibits
100
and
102
sealed
for
appellate
review.
there
is
no
relevant
connection
between
any
of
the
remaining
material
and
any
of
the
defendants,
this
prosecution,
or
the
issues
of
this
hearing.
this
is
finding
9.
i
see
my
time
is
up
but,
your
honor,
for
the
reasons
stated,
we
submit
that
the
convictions
in
this
case
should
be
upheld
and
the
decision
below
affirmed.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
the
case
was
tried
in
1966
from
june
15
to
july
11,
i
believe,
in
1966.
the
operative
facts
occurred
in
december
of
1965
and
then
there
was
indictment,
and
the
trial
came
on
in
june
of
1966.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
was
reading,
your
honor,
from
the
only
place
that
i
know
of
that
the
findings
of
fact
of
the
district
judge
are
reprinted.
they're
in
the
petition
--
the
appendix
--
no,
your
honor,
that's
their
brief.
the
petition
for
certiorari,
page
45(a)

francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
which

the
district
judge's

of
fact
and
conclusions

this
remand
hearing.

you.
