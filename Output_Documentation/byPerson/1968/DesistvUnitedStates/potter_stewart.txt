justice
potter
stewart
about
this
matter
of
interest--
justice
potter
stewart
the
chief--
as
a
matter
of
interest,
the
chief
justice
said
$9
million.
i
read
somewhere
that
the
value
--
estimated
value
of
this
stuff
was
$100
million.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
except,
mr.
glasser,
haven't
you
left
out
the
fact
that,
on
the
motion
to
suppress
before
judge
palmieri,
the
judge
himself
went
up
to
the
waldorf
astoria
hotel
--
justice
potter
stewart
there's
another
way
of
looking
at
this
case,
isn't
there,
mr.
--
is
there
or
am
i
mistaken,
in
the
cases
like
linkletter,
mapp,
that
whole
area,
the
police
knew
what
they
were
doing
was
a
constitutional
violation
whether
under
wolf
against
colorado
--
justice
potter
stewart
they
knew
it
was
wrong.
they
knew
it
violated
the
constitution.
the
question
was
whether
the
sanction
of
evidentiary
exclusion
should
be
applied.
here,
it's
at
least
arguable,
is
it
not,
that
policemen
who
relied
in
good
faith
upon
their
understand
of
the
state
of
the
law
were
not
guilty
of
a
constitutional
violation
at
all
because,
after
all,
the
constitution
makes
illegal
and
illegitimate
only
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures.
and,
policemen
who,
in
good
faith,
are
relying
on
goldman
against
the
united
states
and
their
understanding
of
silverman
against
the
united
states
in
their
conduct
of
electronic
surveillance,
that,
arguably
at
least,
is
not
and
unreasonable
search
or
seizure,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
so,
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
and,
that's
an
argument
available
to
you
in
this
case.
it
was
not
available
to
the
government
in
cases
like
linkletter,
perhaps
it
was
available
in
tehan
--
justice
potter
stewart
it
certainly
was
not
available
in
linkletter,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
i
suggest
it
really
analyzed,
as
i've
tried
to
suggest
in
my
question,
it
isn't
a
matter
of
retroactivity.
it's
a
matter
of
whether
or
not
there
was
a
constitutional
violation
in
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
if
the
policemen
did
it
now,
tomorrow
they
would
do
what
they
did
in
the
light
of
a
katz
decision
and
their
conduct
--
the
reasonableness
of
their
conduct
would
have
to
constitutionally
be
measured
against
the
standard
of
the
katz
decision.
but,
this
surveillance
took
place
long
before
katz
was
decided
and,
since
the
constitution
talks
about
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures,
it's
arguable
that
we're
talking
here
about
retroactivity
at
all.
we're
talking
about
whether
or
not
there
was
a
constitutional
violation
at
all.
isn't
that
correct
or
am
i
quite
wrong?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
as
stovall
suggested,
this
court
is
constitutionally
charged
with
the
duty
of
deciding
cases,
but
the
policemen
act
in
light
of
the
state
of
the
law.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
i
thought
you
simply
said
if
katz
were
retroactive.
justice
potter
stewart
but,
you're
saying
something
different.
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
perhaps
at
least
arguably.
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
think
the
--
what
barring,
if
any,
on
the
issues
in
this
case
does
the
recent
decision
of
the
court
in
the
alaska
case
have,
or
was
it
fuller
against
alaska?
justice
potter
stewart
except,
again,
if
you
concede
any
validity
in
the
theory
suggested
by
my
question,
you
have
a
fortiori
case
from
fuller
because,
in
fuller,
the
police
authorities
knew
what
they
were
doing
was
violative
of
an
explicit
federal
statute,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
whereas,
here,
my
hypothesis
the
law
enforcement
agent,
the
narcotic
agents,
where
conduct
was
measured
by
their
knowledge
of
the
existing
case
law
and
they
did
not,
therefore,
by
--
we
could
assume,
knowingly
violate
the
law
by
contrast
with
fuller
against
alaska.
is
that
fair
to
say
or
not,
am
i
wrong?
justice
potter
stewart
assuming
that
you're
not
going
to
tell
me
i'm
wrong
because
what
i'm
suggesting
is
in
your
favor.
justice
potter
stewart
what?
justice
potter
stewart
i
know,
but
i'm
not
talking
about
that.
justice
potter
stewart
we're
talking
about
the
wrongdoing
by
the
agents
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
sanction
to
prevent
it.
and,
in
the
fuller
case,
we
may
assume
that
there
was
knowing
wrongdoing,
knowing
law
violation
of
a
federal
statute.
in
this
case,
by
contrast,
i
suppose
we
have
to
assume
that
the
agents
were
acting
in
accord
with
their
knowledge
of
the
existing
law
which
was
expressed
in
goldman,
in
silverman,
and
on
lee
and
so
on.
justice
potter
stewart
and
this
all
had
to
do
with
surveillance
that
took
place
down
at
florida
several
years
ago?
justice
potter
stewart
some
years
before
the
commencement
of
this
conspiracy
and
it
was
in
a
restaurant
in
--
down
in
florida,
wasn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
restaurant
--
dioguardi
didn't
have
any
proprietary
interest
in
the
restaurant,
did
he?
justice
potter
stewart
what
did
the
alaska
court
held
in
fuller
--
justice
potter
stewart
with
respect
to
the
605
violation?
justice
potter
stewart
what
did
it
involve
with
respect
to
the
605
violation?
justice
potter
stewart
what
did
the
alaska
court
hold
with
respect
to
the
605
violation
of
fuller?
justice
potter
stewart
there's
a
dissent,
but
the
court
held
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
i
can
find
it.
justice
potter
stewart

you.
