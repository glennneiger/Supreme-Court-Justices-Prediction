justice
john
m.

on
the
findings

assuming

--
on
the
findings
of
fact,
assuming
that
we
accept
those,
there's
nothing
here
on
your
bugging
claim,
is
there?
justice
john
m.
harlan
now
your
bugging
claim,
that
this
was
a
trespassory
bugging.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
thought
you
conceded
in
your
brief,
if
linkletter
applied
this
case,
that
would
be
reversed.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but,
that's
what
you
said
in
your
brief?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i'd
like
to
hear
you
distinguish
linkletter.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
i'm
not
sure
either.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
the
petition
for
certiorari
in
this
case
was
pending
at
the
time
katz
was
decided.
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
a
question
mr.
beytagh?
if
your
view
as
to
stovall
that
prospectivity
is
accepted,
does
that
leave
any
vitality
to
linkletter
and
johnson?
justice
john
m.
harlan
as
i
understand
it,
your
--
it's
your
argument
in
here
the
stovall
rule
which
says
that
if
a
rule
is
made
--
a
new
rule
is
made,
it's
to
be
applied
only
prospectively,
that
is,
to
cases
arising
after
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
after
the
decision,
namely
that
the
man
to
whom
it's
applied,
he's
had
a
lucky
constitutional
chance.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
room
does
that
leave
for
linkletter-type
retroactivity
when
he
can
cut
off
dates
or
johnson-type
retroactivity
type
of
trial
beginning
in
the
boardrooms?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
what
i
understood
you
to
say.
in
other
words,
as
i
understood,
the
thrust
of
your
retroactivity
argument
merely
was
that
in
the
developing
of
this
new
doctrine
and,
of
course,
everybody
would
recognized
it,
beginning
with
linkletter
and
following
through
to
johnson
and
to
stovall
that,
really
what
was
important
to
come
out
if
this
thing
in
its
last
expression
was
that
new
rules
are
to
be
prospective
only
in
the
sense
of
applying
only
to
cases
arising
out
before
it
was
announced.
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
that's
exactly
how
i
understood
your
position,
but
my
question
to
you
is,
doesn't
that
overrule
linkletter?
this
is
a
fourth
amendment
case.
justice
john
m.
harlan
by
vitality,
do
you
think?
justice
john
m.
harlan
maybe
it
shouldn't
have
any
more
vitality,
but
i
don't
see
how
you
can
escape
conclusions
as
far
as
fourth
amendment
cases
are
concerned.
if
your
view
in
this
case
is
that
linkletter
is
challenged,
well,
i
don't
know
if
vitality
has
to
do
with
this.
justice
john
m.
harlan
at
all?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
--
can
i
ask
you,
mr.
beytagh,
what
year
was
this
case
tried?
justice
john
m.
harlan
on
the
findings
of
fact
