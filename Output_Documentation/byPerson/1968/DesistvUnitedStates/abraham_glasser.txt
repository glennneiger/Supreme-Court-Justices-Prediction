mr.
abraham
glasser
your
honor,
this
is
my
colleague,
mr.
markowitz.
mr.
abraham
glasser
it's
strong.
mr.
abraham
glasser
mr.
chief
justice
and
associate
justices
and
my
--
mr.
beytagh.
this
is--
the
grant
of
certiorari
here
is
to
review
a
judgment
of
the
second
circuit
which
affirmed
a
narcotics
conviction,
a
rather
notable
narcotics
conviction,
as
i
think
your
honors
know.
it
involved
the
largest
shipment
of
pure
heroin
ever
captured
in
this
country,
familiarly
known
as
the
trench
deep
freeze
case.
the
narcotics
were
brought
over
by
whoever
brought
them,
secreted
in
a
hollowed
out
deep
freeze
structure.
now,
our
men,
our
petitioners
all
have
very
heavy
jail
sentences.
the
shortest
sentence
is
10
years,
that's
sutera.
dioguardi
has
15
years,
desist
has
18
years,
and
the
two
french
defendants,
nebbia
and
lefranc,
have
20
years
and
a
$5,000-fine.
i'm
purposely
emphasizing
the
sentences
and
another
factor,
which
i
will
mention
in
a
moment,
at
the
outset.
i'm
emphasizing
at
the
outset
for
reasons
that
i
will
mention
momentarily.
these
men
have
now
served
about,
let's
see,
nebbia
and
lefranc
have
been
sitting
in
jail
since
about
the
end
of
december
of
1965,
the
year
that
this
situation
was
broken
open.
so
they're
in
now
nearly
three
years,
and
the
other--
the
others,
that
is
dioguardi,
sutera,
and
desist,
were
out
on
bale
for
awhile
and
then
they've
been
in
for
a
little
over
two
years.
the
government
has
the
heroin.
this
heroin
was
not
marketed.
the
government
has
the
batch.
and,
the
government
now
has,
paid
out
by
these
men,
a
certain
amount
of
jail
service.
i'm
mentioning
that
because
we
all
know
that,
in
the
briefing
over
the
question
of
retroactivity
of
katz
in
this
case,
the
government
has
expressed
concern
that
there
will
be
something
alarming
to
the
sense
of
law
enforcement
in
giving
this
type
of
defendant
the
benefit
of
a
case
like
the
katz
case
on
retroactivity.
so,
i'm
saying
that
it
isn't,
all
together,
a
dead
loss
in
realistic
down
the
earth
day
to
day
law
enforcement
policy
terms.
the
government
has
the
heroin
and
the
men
have
served--
well,
they've
all
already
served
a
good
bit
of
jail
time.
mr.
abraham
glasser
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
abraham
glasser
no.
the
entire--
in
fact,
your
honor,
the
deep
freeze--
this
is
according
to
the
government's
theory
of
the
case,
the
deep
freeze
was
received
in
the
hands
of
a
fellow
name
condor,
an
army
warrant
officer
in
georgia.
he,
according
to
the
government's
theory,
was
told
one
night
to
unpack
it
and
he
had
it
unpacked
and,
in
suitcases,
and
felt
very
gingerly
about
it
and
want
to
be
rid
of
it,
and
he
was
rid
of
it
pretty
quickly
--
the
police
came
and
got
it.
none
of
the
defendants,
who
are
the
petitioners
here,
have
been--
are
shown
to
have
had
any
contact
with
this
heroin.
condor,
of
course,
says
that
desist
supplied
him
with
the
deep
freeze
and
then
hollowed
it
out.
he--
well,
there--
isn't
even
definite
if
desist
hollowed
out
the
deep
freeze,
but
except
for
that
context
of
desist
with
the
alleged
preparation
of
the
structure
there
is
no--
this
isn't
even
a
possession
case,
incidentally,
not
to
that
matters
at
this
stage,
i
know,
but
it
may
be
of
interest.
mr.
abraham
glasser
physical
contact
with
it.
mr.
abraham
glasser
i'd
go
further,
your
honor.
mr.
abraham
glasser
i'd
go
further,
although
i
didn't
wish
to
interrupt
your
honor,
i
would
go
further.
they
not
only
didn't
have
physical--
this
is
all
under
the
proofs.
we're
talking
about
what
the
proof
show.
the
proof
show
not
only
no
contact,
but
the
proofs
don't
even
tie
in
these
people
with
the
heroin
except
through,
well,
the
circumstantial
evidence
that
condor
says
desist
gave
him
money
to
bring
the
deep
freeze
over.
condor
claimed
he
did
not
know
it
was
heroin.
so,
there's
no
proof
there.
there's
no
tie
in
of
desist
with
heroin
there.
and
--
mr.
abraham
glasser
not
really.
i'm
really
arguing
the
atmosphere
of
the
case,
in
case
you
let
these
fellows
go.
mr.
abraham
glasser
that
you
shouldn't
feel
too
badly
about
letting
them
go
if
you
apply
katz.
that's
my
theme
at
this
moment.
mr.
abraham
glasser
of
course.
mr.
abraham
glasser
no,
this
is
not
a
louisville
versus
kentucky
case,
no.
mr.
abraham
glasser
i
think
if
it
had
been
that,
you'd
have
a
brief
from
me
on
it.
but,
i
think
i
briefed
practically
everything
else
in
this
case.
no,
it's
not
a
louisville
versus
--
yes.
mr.
abraham
glasser
shall
i
continue?
mr.
abraham
glasser
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
abraham
glasser
$100
million
is
--
yes,
that
figure,
i've
read
also.
that
depends
i
suppose
on
how
they
cut
it
up,
how
they
--
mr.
abraham
glasser
shall
i
continue
now,
your
honor?
well,
there
are,
of
course,
the
other
aspects
of
this
case
and
the
aspects--
that
we
all
had
the
impression
where
the
aspects
cause
the
grant
of
certiorari,
and
that's
the
electronic
monitoring.
we
all
have
the
impression
that,
by
far,
the
forefront
issue
in
this
case
is
the
electronic
issue
and
the
issue
of
retroactivity
of
katz.
now,
i'd
like
to
say
something
that
might
--
well,
may
--
i
hope
it
won't
startle
anyone
un--
in
a
discomfiting
way.
it's
startled
me
a
little
bit
when
i
finally
realized
it
which
was,
frankly,
just
a
few
days
ago
after
i
read
the
court's
fuller
versus
alaska
decision
and
felt
dismay
at
the
sudden
sinking
of
our
chances
in
our
case,
but
the
dismay,
as
sometimes
happens,
provoked
me
to
rethink
the
whole
situation
very
hard.
and,
i
suddenly
saw
this,
and
i'd
like
to
convey
this
to
the
court.
we
don't
need,
in
this
case,
a
ruling
that
katz
is
retroactive.
all
we
need,
and
i
believe
we're
entitled
to
it
on
correct
law,
what
we
need
is
a
ruling
that
katz
declared
preexisting
law.
katz
didn't
make
new
law.
i
have
read
katz,
again,
very
carefully
the
last
few
days.
in
fact,
i've
put
it
in
another
brief
last
friday,
which
i
--
which
is
called
the
joint
supplemental
reply
brief
which
i
trust
your
honors
have
received.
and,
that
brief
is
largely
devoted
to
arguing
that
katz
did
not
make
new
law,
but
that
katz
merely
gave
expression
to
preexisting
fourth
amendment
law.
if
that
analysis
is
correct,
this
analysis
i've
just
offered,
if
that's
correct,
there
is
no
retroactivity
problem
here
at
all.
it
becomes
rather
like
the
situation
is
stovall
where
mr.
justice
fortas,
in
his
separate
opinion
in
stovall,
noted
that
he
would
not
have
reached
the
--
he
would
not
reach
the
retroactivity
issue.
he
would
treat
the
issue
as
one
of
due
process.
in
other
words,
preexisting
due
process.
we're
not
making
new
law
that
requires
a
painful
decision
on
retroactivity.
we're
simply
applying
the
law
as
it
existed.
and,
i
will
invite
your
honors
to
focus
especially
on
a
rereading
of
katz.
when
you
undertake
your
own
deliberation
and
study
on
the
case,
read
katz
closely
please
to
see
whether
i'm
not
right
that
it's
not
a
retroactivity
decision
at
all.
it's
--
mr.
abraham
glasser
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
abraham
glasser
i
--
i
see
your
honor
smiling,
and
i'm
smiling
not
only
in
neutrality,
but
because
i
have
a
very
pleasant
things
to
say.
i
have
excellent
authority
for
the
--
i
almost
set
notions
for
the
position
that
katz
was
always
the
law.
mr.
chief
justice,
in
the
yutangco
argument,
as
reported
in
the
criminal
law
reporter
a
few
weeks
ago,
the
solicitor
general
said
that
--
something
about
that
what
the
men
in
katz
did,
the
agents
did,
was
legal
at
the
time
they
did
it
and
your
honor
said,
“well,
then,
if
that
were
so,
wouldn't
we
have
abided
by
precedent?”
i
think
it's
one
of
those
--
anyway,
your
honor
was
apparently
suggesting
to
the
solicitor
general
there
that
katz
merely
stated
the
--
what
katz
says
is
what
the
law
always
was.
now,
there
are
other
reasons
why
we
don't
--
we,
the
petitioners,
consider
that
we
do
not
stand
or
fall,
our
fate
does
not
depend
upon
the
question
of
retroactivity
or
prospectivity
of
katz.
there
is
--there
is
a
whole
other
half
of
this
case.
we
contend
that
what
the
government
did,
what
the
narcotic
agents
did,
in
the
electronic
eavesdropping
which,
by
the
way,
was
done
at
the
waldorf
astoria
hotel.
i
don't
think
i
have
mentioned
that
yet.
at
the
waldorf
astoria
hotel
in
december
1965,
narcotic
agents
installed
an
electronic
type
of
listening
device
in
a
room
adjoining
a
room
occupied
by
petitioner
nebbia.
then,
over
the
next
couple
of
days,
the
agents
heard
various
things
which
were
testified
to
at
the
trial
and
which
if
believed,
were
damaging.
now,
the
agents
say
that
they
put
their
bug
in
their
own
room
rather
than
in
nebbia's
room
and
that
they
didn't
penetrate
nebbia's
enclosure
or
close
in
anyway,
that
they
laid
the
microphone,
the
listening
device,
at
the
bottom
of
the
door
of
their
own
room
where
there
was
a
small
aperture.
then,
beyond
that
door
was
an
air
space
of
a
few
inches
and
then
a
door
nebbia's
room,
the
typical
double
door
arrangement
that
you
get
in
some
of
the
better
class
hotels.
the
agents
claim,
in
other
words,
a
completely
non-trespassory
and
non-physically
intrusive
type
of
monitoring.
now,
i
--
this
is
only
the
second
time
i've
ever
argued
before
this
court,
and
the
last
time
was
more
than
20
years
ago.
i
don't
know
the
amenities.
am
i
permitted
to
hand
up
for
those
or
to
the
clerk?
mr.
abraham
glasser
there
are
some
photos
here,
which
are
government
exhibit,
showing
illici
--
showing
the
way
this
was
done.
mr.
abraham
glasser
one
of
those
photos
shows
a
towel
draped
over
the
--
over
something.
what
it's
draped
over,
the
testimony
shows,
is
straightly
over
the
microphone.
mr.
abraham
glasser
yes.
i
have
something
else
that
wasn't
in
court
which
i
hope
your
honor
will
look
at,
but
that's
a
general
publication.
i
might
mention
that
right
now,
as
a
matter
of
fact.
there
was
intense
dispute
at
the
trial
and
even
more
intense
dispute
at
the
appeal
as
to
whether
the
agents
had
told
the
truth
as
to
how
they
put
in
this
listening
device.
however,
at
the
trial,
at
the
pretrial
motion
to
suppress,
the
district
judge
ruled
that
he
believed
the
agents
and
that
there
was
no
trespass
and
no
illegality
of
any
kind
of
the
monitoring.
then,
on
the
appeal,
in
restudying
the
whole
thing
for
the
appeal,
we
saw
that
--
we
saw
that
there
was
more,
that
there
was
not
just
smoke
but
fire.
we
felt
that
we
were
discerning
suspicious
items
in
the
record
that
really
require
further
scrutiny
--
mr.
abraham
glasser
i
have
left
that
out
but
--
mr.
abraham
glasser
yes.
mr.
abraham
glasser
that's
correct,
your
honor.
i
did
believe
that
out
and
i'm
sorry
but,
of
course,
we
don't
think
that
that
matters.
we
don't
think
that
hurts
our
case,
that
judge
palmieri
did
that
because
we
think
the
agents
didn't
show
judge
palmieri
what
they
had
actually
done
the
preceding
december.
mr.
abraham
glasser
yes,
it
has,
but
we
have
briefed
it
here
in
a
way
that
we
think
entitles
us
to
have
this
court
consider
it
on
review.
now,
i
was
saying
that
when
we
got
to
appeal
time
in
this
case,
in
the
court
of
appeals,
we
went
out
and
we
hired
--
for
the
first
time,
we
hired
an
electronic
consultant.
we
hired
the
one
that
we,
after
inquiring,
we
thought
was
the
best
one
in
the
country.
the
government
has
disparaged
this
man's
qualifications.
his
name
is
bernard
spindel
and
i
have
here,
if
the
court
would
wish
to
receive
them,
three
issues
of
a
life
magazine
article
about
a
year
ago
--
about
two
years
ago,
featuring
spindel
as
the
top
number
one
electronic
expert
in
the
country.
the
article
is
interesting
anyway
and
i
don't
know
whether
the
court
would
wish
to
have
it,
but
if
they
do,
if
the
court
would
wish
to
have
this,
i
would
like
to
hand
these
to
the
clerk
also.
mr.
abraham
glasser
this
is
not
in
the
record.
mr.
abraham
glasser
all
right.
i'll
give
the
government
a
copy.
our
point
is,
in
offering
something
like
this
and
in
my
point
in
arguing
it,
is
that
there's
not
much
doubt
in
my
mind
that
one
of
the
reasons
we
didn't
get
more
credence
to
our
demonstrations
of
dubious
truthfulness
on
the
part
of
the
agents
was
that
our
electronic
expert
was
not
credited
as
being
an
expert.
it
seems
to
me
there
were
just
a
bit
of
a
--
well,
i
don't
mean
to
use
an
impertinent
term,
a
bit
of
stubbornness
about
conceding
that
a
fellow
with
a
flamboyant
kind
of
style
like
that,
a
flamboyant
placed
in
society
could
also
be
an
authentic
scientific
expert,
which
we
maintain
he
is.
now,
--
mr.
abraham
glasser
i
am
arguing
the
credibility
of
the
narcotic
agent
witnesses
in
the
motion
to
suppress
hearing.
i'm
arguing
that
to
this
court
because
we
consider
that
the
indications
are
overwhelming,
that
the
agents
could
not
have
been
telling
the
truth,
and
that
in
the
schipani
--
what
we
call
the
schipani
review
procedure,
that
there
is
always
open
the
duty
and
the
possibility
of
new
appellant
scrutiny
where
there
has
been
trespassory
eavesdropping.
if
it
hadn't
been
for
schipani
and
black
and
that
whole
course
of
decisions,
and
the
department
of
justice
own
very
gracious
program
which
was
started
during
mr.
justice
marshall's
time.
oh,
i
see
he's
not
on
the
bench.
well,
if
it
hadn't
been
for
schipani,
we
would
have
very
faint
hope
of
interesting
this
court
in
this
contention
addressed
to
the
credibility
of
the
narcotic
agents.
but,
with
schipani
in
the
picture,
we
think
it
would
be
perfectly
normal
and
right
and
necessary
for
the
court
to
hear
us
in
that
argument
and
to
determine
whether
we're
--
whether
our
argument
is
--
has
--
carries
any
persuasion.
mr.
abraham
glasser
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
abraham
glasser
we
would
contend
--
we
would
be
content
to
--
well,
here,
we
made
motions
and
filed
affidavits
in
the
circuit
court
of
appeal
--
in
the
court
of
appeals
during
dependency
of
the
appeal
asking
them
to
pick
up
the
schipani
task.
schipani
have
come
down
in
december
1966.
we
were
arguing
before
the
court
of
appeals
during
the
months
of
january,
february,
march.
we
were
bombarding
them
with
motions
and
affidavits
asking
them
to
entertain
a
schipani
review.
and
--
mr.
abraham
glasser
asking
--
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
abraham
glasser
i'm
sorry,
did
the
government
--
mr.
abraham
glasser
did
the
government
acknowledge
illegal
bugging?
yes.
mr.
abraham
glasser
no.
mr.
abraham
glasser
no,
but
i
guess
i
have
to
really
call
a
space
--
spade
then.
see,
we
think
the
narcotic
agents
must
have
deceived
the
department
of
justice.
we're
sure
the
department
of
justice
is
not,
in
complicity,
anything
wrong
here.
we're
positive
of
that.
i'm
not
just
saying
that
to
be
diplomatic.
we're
convinced
of
that,
but
we
do
think
that
there
has
been
--
we
do
think
there
has
not
been
--
we
think
the
presumption
of
official
regularity
is
not
justified
here
on
a
showing
that
we've
made.
now,
about
--
mr.
abraham
glasser
nothing
to
our
claim
that
the
--
mr.
abraham
glasser
if
you
accept
the
findings
of
judge
palmieri,
there
is
nothing
to
our
bugging
claim.
mr.
abraham
glasser
of
course.
we
are
asking
that
the
court
apply
the
schipani
and
general
fourth
amendment
scrutiny
powers
that
the
court
brought
into
operation
in
those
cases
during
the
year
--
during
the
second
half
of
1966,
in
which
the
department
of
justice
has
been
cooperating
--
in
which
the
department
has
been
cooperating
with
the
court.
now
--
and
i
might,
at
this
point,
interject.
there's
president
johnson's
order
of
june
30,
1965.
now,
there
have
been
references
to
such
an
order
in
papers
filed
by
the
solicitor
general's
office
in
this
court
in
a
number
of
certiorari
situations,
references
to
the
president's
order
as
having
called
upon
the
entire
federal
establishment
to
review
whether
they
had
been
engaging
in
any
illegal
electronic
activity.
that's
about
as
far
as
one
can
determine
from
the
government's
descriptions
of
the
president's
order,
what
that
order
contained.
now,
we've
been
trying
for
a
long
time
to
get
the
contents
of
that
order.
the
government
has
still
not
told
us
the
contents
of
that
order.
we
think
that
if
there
was
a
presidential
order
which
was
disobeyed
by
narcotic
agents,
that
they
are
acting
ultra
vires
and
that
if
there
couldn't
be
a
more
classic
instance
of
the
violation
of
due
process
of
law,
then
to
be
under
process
which
has
no
law
in
it
whatever,
that
is,
a
usurpational
subordinate
of
employee
of
the
federal
government
of
the
executive
branch.
invading
privacy
is
violating
not
only
the
fourth
amendment,
but
due
process
of
law.
we
think
the
president's
order
should
be
--
we
hope
that
this
court
will
see
fit
to
ask
the
solicitor
general
to
disclose
the
contents
of
the
president's
order.
now,
there
again,
off
the
record,
i
have
a
copy
of
what
purports
to
be
the
--
i've
had
it
since
last
december.
i
want
to
be
frank
with
the
court.
i
don't
know
whether
i'm
allowed
to
have
it.
desist
sent
it
to
me
from
jail.
i
don't
know
where
he
got
it.
it
reads
to
me
very,
very
con
--
it
has
perfect
versatility
to
it.
it
--
it's
authentic.
i've
been
--
i
was
--
i
know
government
writing.
i've
been
in
the
executive
branch
as
a
writer.
it
--
it's
written.
it's
not
--
it
sounds
real.
now,
if
it
--
if
the
actual
order
is
like
this
one
that
i've
got,
there
will
be
another
brief
filed
--
still
another
brief
filed
in
this
case
by
us.
mr.
abraham
glasser
president
johnson
is
said
by
the
solicitor
general
in
the
black
memorandum,
in
the
schipani
memorandum,
and
in
one
other
memorandum
that
were
filed
in
memorandum
which
was
filed
in
this
court
in
which
the
solicitor
general
was
working
out
his
own
new
approach
in
connection
with
electronic
monitoring.
he
said,
there's
a
presidential
order
of
june
30,
1965
addressed
to
the
entire
federal
establishment
calling
us
all
to
different
standards
of
conduct
in
connection
with
electronic
monitoring.
and,
there
are
a
few
other
clues.
one
clue
is
that
the
president
really
only
wanted
it
done
for
--
where
national
security
was
attacked.
he
only
wanted
it
done
with
advanced
permission
and
approval
of
each
instance
from
the
attorney
general.
he
didn't
want
any
wire
tapping
apparently
at
all.
mr.
abraham
glasser
the
significance
of
this
is
that
the
president's
order
is
june
30,
1965,
the
bugging
in
our
case
is
december
1965.
the
significance
would
be
that
the
bugging
disobeyed
the
president's
order.
mr.
abraham
glasser
if
it
did,
it
is
usurpational.
we
contend
then
--
mr.
abraham
glasser
we
were
practically
tender
a
federalist
paper
on
that
point.
the
point
we
deem
to
be
so
fundamental
that
we
would
--
we
wish
we
could
write.
mr.
abraham
glasser
executive
power.
the
executive
power
of
the
united
states
is
vested
in
a
president.
the
president
has
an
executive
power,
not
his
subordinates
have
it,
except
as
far
as
he
delegates
it
to
them.
when
they
exercise
the
power
to
see
that
the
laws
are
faithfully
executed,
the
power
to
enforce
the
laws,
in
the
president's
name
and
it
is
an
enforcement
action
which
the
president
has
strictly
forbidden
them
to
take,
aren't
they
usurpers?
i
don't
mean
to
call
names
but,
i
mean,
we
have
to
--
i'm
using
classic
terms
here.
mr.
abraham
glasser
oh,
yes,
entirely
so,
and
it
has
been
pretty
heavily
briefed.
i
--
sorry,
i
keep
talking
about
the
people
i
--
i'm
aware
of
my
--
i
would
like
to
stop
now
and
save
my
remaining
five
minutes
for
rebuttal,
if
i
may.
mr.
abraham
glasser
thank
you,
your
honor.
the
kolod-alderisio
problem
in
our
case
would
exist
only
in
relation
to
the
florida
bugging.
we
agree
with
the
government.
there's
no
real
issue
on
florida,
but
there
is
a
very
severe
issue,
we
say,
in
connection
with
an
allegedly
abortive
additional
bugging
in
georgia.
i
haven't
spoken
of
that
today.
we've
briefed
it
pretty
completely,
and
i
would
ask
the
court
to
watch
for
that
item
since
there
was
some
animation
here
at
the
end
about
the
kolod
problem
which
i
think
it
is
currently
before
the
court.
now
--
mr.
abraham
glasser
they
--
the
agent
who
ran
it
said
he
didn't
get
the
tape,
and
i
think
one
other
agent
who
was
in
the
car
with
him
said
they
didn't
get
any
effective
audible
results.
but,
again,
we
had
a
very
hard
pushing
hearing
in
which
i,
for
one,
can
wait,
feeling
that
i
was
entitled
to
make
a
strong
appellate
point
against
the
credibility
of
those
agents
on
that
issue
too.
and,
indeed,
on
that
issue
above
all,
they
were
crawling
all
over
that
part
of
georgia.
they
were
there
about
to
score,
and
they
were
not
hesitating
to
bug.
they
were
bugging
all
over
the
country.
we
think
we
can't
prove
that
they
were
bugging
in
europe.
these
fellows
lived
with
bugs.
it's
incredible
to
me
that
they
didn't
have
more
than
that
one
abortive
car
bug
in
georgia.
they
must
have
bugged
desist's
room.
i'm
speaking
of
perhaps
--
well,
all
right,
i'll
drop
that
point
for
now
because
it's
been
thoroughly
briefed.
our
whole
submission
is
sufficiently
stated
in
the
briefs.
now,
on
fuller,
again,
may
i
say
something
that
is
--
have
been
abrupt.
we
think
this
court
should
withdraw
its
action
in
fuller
on
the
ground
that
certiorari
there
was
improvidently
granted
and
i'd
like
to
say
why.
we've
covered
it
thoroughly
in
our
last
brief.
fuller
involved
a
telegram,
we
all
know
that,
but
back
of
that
telegram
was
a
subpoena.
the
police
in
fuller
were
not
defiant
or
willful
towards
existing
law.
the
police
in
fuller
went
to
the
alaska
communications
body,
whatever
it's
called,
got
voluntary
relinquishment
of
the
telegram
from
that
body
pursuant
to
a
federal
regulation
and
they
also
got
a
subpoena.
now,
the
exact
details
of
that
whole
subpoena
picture,
i
don't
know
for
sure
of
myself
because
i
haven't
seen
the
fuller
record
but
i've
been
guided
through
it
in
consultation
in
clause,
consultation
with
one
of
the
fuller
certiorari
counsel.
i
have
the
page
numbers.
this
is
covered
in
our
last
brief.
now,
if
there
was
a
subpoena
in
fuller
for
that
telegram,
how
can
your
honors
reach
the
question
in
fuller
of
a
violation
of
605
because
the
very
first
sentence
of
605
provides
for
subpoenas
nor,
at
least
colorably
and
subject
to
a
closer
scrutiny
of
the
record
in
fuller
than
--
which
your
honors
may
well
wish
to
do
because
fuller
is
a
pretty
drastic
decision,
and
to
render
a
drastic
decision
like
fuller
on
a
record
that
may
not
stand
up
under
scholarly
criticism
one
of
these
days,
i
would
think
would
be
something
that
the
court
that
wish
to
hear
about.
mr.
abraham
glasser
the
alaska
court
never
--
mr.
abraham
glasser
never
touch
this
problem
that
i'm
talking
about
now.
oh,
well,
they
touched
the
605
problem.
mr.
abraham
glasser
yes,
they
touched
the
605,
but
they
didn't
touch
the
problem
of
subpoena
pursuant
to
605.
mr.
abraham
glasser
they
held
that
--
let
me
think.
now,
wait
a
minute.
mr.
abraham
glasser
they
--
oh,
they
held
that
605
does
not
apply
to
states
that
they
adopted
the
basic
schwartz
line.
mr.
abraham
glasser
now,
i
have
here
a
copy
of
the
alaska
opinion.
well,
i
suppose
your
honor
really
want
to
see
it
right
this
minute,
do
you?
mr.
abraham
glasser
alright.
mr.
abraham
glasser
i'm
sorry
that
my
recollection
is
fuzzy
on
that.
i'm
pretty
sure
it
was
the
--
well,
i
said
the
schwartz
approach.
now,
on
katz
on
pre-katz
versus
what
the
law
was
or
what
it
became
in
view
of
katz
--
oh,
my
time
has
--
is
expired.
i'm
sorry.
your
honor,
mr.
markowitz
asked
me
and
i
told
him
i
would
ask
you.
can
he
argue
for
five
minutes?
mr.
abraham
glasser
your
honor,
this
is
my
colleague,
mr.
markowitz.
mr.
abraham
glasser
it's
strong.
mr.
abraham
glasser
mr.
chief
justice
and
associate
justices
and
my
--
mr.
beytagh.
this
is--
the
grant
of
certiorari
here
is
to
review
a
judgment
of
the
second
circuit
which
affirmed
a
narcotics
conviction,
a
rather
notable
narcotics
conviction,
as
i
think
your
honors
know.
it
involved
the
largest
shipment
of
pure
heroin
ever
captured
in
this
country,
familiarly
known
as
the
trench
deep
freeze
case.
the
narcotics
were
brought
over
by
whoever
brought
them,
secreted
in
a
hollowed
out
deep
freeze
structure.
now,
our
men,
our
petitioners
all
have
very
heavy
jail
sentences.
the
shortest
sentence
is
10
years,
that's
sutera.
dioguardi
has
15
years,
desist
has
18
years,
and
the
two
french
defendants,
nebbia
and
lefranc,
have
20
years
and
a
$5,000-fine.
i'm
purposely
emphasizing
the
sentences
and
another
factor,
which
i
will
mention
in
a
moment,
at
the
outset.
i'm
emphasizing
at
the
outset
for
reasons
that
i
will
mention
momentarily.
these
men
have
now
served
about,
let's
see,
nebbia
and
lefranc
have
been
sitting
in
jail
since
about
the
end
of
december
of
1965,
the
year
that
this
situation
was
broken
open.
so
they're
in
now
nearly
three
years,
and
the
other--
the
others,
that
is
dioguardi,
sutera,
and
desist,
were
out
on
bale
for
awhile
and
then
they've
been
in
for
a
little
over
two
years.
the
government
has
the
heroin.
this
heroin
was
not
marketed.
the
government
has
the
batch.
and,
the
government
now
has,
paid
out
by
these
men,
a
certain
amount
of
jail
service.
i'm
mentioning
that
because
we
all
know
that,
in
the
briefing
over
the
question
of
retroactivity
of
katz
in
this
case,
the
government
has
expressed
concern
that
there
will
be
something
alarming
to
the
sense
of
law
enforcement
in
giving
this
type
of
defendant
the
benefit
of
a
case
like
the
katz
case
on
retroactivity.
so,
i'm
saying
that
it
isn't,
all
together,
a
dead
loss
in
realistic
down
the
earth
day
to
day
law
enforcement
policy
terms.
the
government
has
the
heroin
and
the
men
have
served--
well,
they've
all
already
served
a
good
bit
of
jail
time.
mr.
abraham
glasser
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
abraham
glasser
no.
the
entire--
in
fact,
your
honor,
the
deep
freeze--
this
is
according
to
the
government's
theory
of
the
case,
the
deep
freeze
was
received
in
the
hands
of
a
fellow
name
condor,
an
army
warrant
officer
in
georgia.
he,
according
to
the
government's
theory,
was
told
one
night
to
unpack
it
and
he
had
it
unpacked
and,
in
suitcases,
and
felt
very
gingerly
about
it
and
want
to
be
rid
of
it,
and
he
was
rid
of
it
pretty
quickly
--
the
police
came
and
got
it.
none
of
the
defendants,
who
are
the
petitioners
here,
have
been--
are
shown
to
have
had
any
contact
with
this
heroin.
condor,
of
course,
says
that
desist
supplied
him
with
the
deep
freeze
and
then
hollowed
it
out.
he--
well,
there--
isn't
even
definite
if
desist
hollowed
out
the
deep
freeze,
but
except
for
that
context
of
desist
with
the
alleged
preparation
of
the
structure
there
is
no--
this
isn't
even
a
possession
case,
incidentally,
not
to
that
matters
at
this
stage,
i
know,
but
it
may
be
of
interest.
mr.
abraham
glasser
physical
contact
with
it.
mr.
abraham
glasser
i'd
go
further,
your
honor.
mr.
abraham
glasser
i'd
go
further,
although
i
didn't
wish
to
interrupt
your
honor,
i
would
go
further.
they
not
only
didn't
have
physical--
this
is
all
under
the
proofs.
we're
talking
about
what
the
proof
show.
the
proof
show
not
only
no
contact,
but
the
proofs
don't
even
tie
in
these
people
with
the
heroin
except
through,
well,
the
circumstantial
evidence
that
condor
says
desist
gave
him
money
to
bring
the
deep
freeze
over.
condor
claimed
he
did
not
know
it
was
heroin.
so,
there's
no
proof
there.
there's
no
tie
in
of
desist
with
heroin
there.
and
--
mr.
abraham
glasser
not
really.
i'm
really
arguing
the
atmosphere
of
the
case,
in
case
you
let
these
fellows
go.
mr.
abraham
glasser
that
you
shouldn't
feel
too
badly
about
letting
them
go
if
you
apply
katz.
that's
my
theme
at
this
moment.
mr.
abraham
glasser
of
course.
mr.
abraham
glasser
no,
this
is
not
a
louisville
versus
kentucky
case,
no.
mr.
abraham
glasser
i
think
if
it
had
been
that,
you'd
have
a
brief
from
me
on
it.
but,
i
think
i
briefed
practically
everything
else
in
this
case.
no,
it's
not
a
louisville
versus
--
yes.
mr.
abraham
glasser
shall
i
continue?
mr.
abraham
glasser
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
abraham
glasser
$100
million
is
--
yes,
that
figure,
i've
read
also.
that
depends
i
suppose
on
how
they
cut
it
up,
how
they
--
mr.
abraham
glasser
shall
i
continue
now,
your
honor?
well,
there
are,
of
course,
the
other
aspects
of
this
case
and
the
aspects--
that
we
all
had
the
impression
where
the
aspects
cause
the
grant
of
certiorari,
and
that's
the
electronic
monitoring.
we
all
have
the
impression
that,
by
far,
the
forefront
issue
in
this
case
is
the
electronic
issue
and
the
issue
of
retroactivity
of
katz.
now,
i'd
like
to
say
something
that
might
--
well,
may
--
i
hope
it
won't
startle
anyone
un--
in
a
discomfiting
way.
it's
startled
me
a
little
bit
when
i
finally
realized
it
which
was,
frankly,
just
a
few
days
ago
after
i
read
the
court's
fuller
versus
alaska
decision
and
felt
dismay
at
the
sudden
sinking
of
our
chances
in
our
case,
but
the
dismay,
as
sometimes
happens,
provoked
me
to
rethink
the
whole
situation
very
hard.
and,
i
suddenly
saw
this,
and
i'd
like
to
convey
this
to
the
court.
we
don't
need,
in
this
case,
a
ruling
that
katz
is
retroactive.
all
we
need,
and
i
believe
we're
entitled
to
it
on
correct
law,
what
we
need
is
a
ruling
that
katz
declared
preexisting
law.
katz
didn't
make
new
law.
i
have
read
katz,
again,
very
carefully
the
last
few
days.
in
fact,
i've
put
it
in
another
brief
last
friday,
which
i
--
which
is
called
the
joint
supplemental
reply
brief
which
i
trust
your
honors
have
received.
and,
that
brief
is
largely
devoted
to
arguing
that
katz
did
not
make
new
law,
but
that
katz
merely
gave
expression
to
preexisting
fourth
amendment
law.
if
that
analysis
is
correct,
this
analysis
i've
just
offered,
if
that's
correct,
there
is
no
retroactivity
problem
here
at
all.
it
becomes
rather
like
the
situation
is
stovall
where
mr.
justice
fortas,
in
his
separate
opinion
in
stovall,
noted
that
he
would
not
have
reached
the
--
he
would
not
reach
the
retroactivity
issue.
he
would
treat
the
issue
as
one
of
due
process.
in
other
words,
preexisting
due
process.
we're
not
making
new
law
that
requires
a
painful
decision
on
retroactivity.
we're
simply
applying
the
law
as
it
existed.
and,
i
will
invite
your
honors
to
focus
especially
on
a
rereading
of
katz.
when
you
undertake
your
own
deliberation
and
study
on
the
case,
read
katz
closely
please
to
see
whether
i'm
not
right
that
it's
not
a
retroactivity
decision
at
all.
it's
--
mr.
abraham
glasser
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
abraham
glasser
i
--
i
see
your
honor
smiling,
and
i'm
smiling
not
only
in
neutrality,
but
because
i
have
a
very
pleasant
things
to
say.
i
have
excellent
authority
for
the
--
i
almost
set
notions
for
the
position
that
katz
was
always
the
law.
mr.
chief
justice,
in
the
yutangco
argument,
as
reported
in
the
criminal
law
reporter
a
few
weeks
ago,
the
solicitor
general
said
that
--
something
about
that
what
the
men
in
katz
did,
the
agents
did,
was
legal
at
the
time
they
did
it
and
your
honor
said,
“well,
then,
if
that
were
so,
wouldn't
we
have
abided
by
precedent?”
i
think
it's
one
of
those
--
anyway,
your
honor
was
apparently
suggesting
to
the
solicitor
general
there
that
katz
merely
stated
the
--
what
katz
says
is
what
the
law
always
was.
now,
there
are
other
reasons
why
we
don't
--
we,
the
petitioners,
consider
that
we
do
not
stand
or
fall,
our
fate
does
not
depend
upon
the
question
of
retroactivity
or
prospectivity
of
katz.
there
is
--there
is
a
whole
other
half
of
this
case.
we
contend
that
what
the
government
did,
what
the
narcotic
agents
did,
in
the
electronic
eavesdropping
which,
by
the
way,
was
done
at
the
waldorf
astoria
hotel.
i
don't
think
i
have
mentioned
that
yet.
at
the
waldorf
astoria
hotel
in
december
1965,
narcotic
agents
installed
an
electronic
type
of
listening
device
in
a
room
adjoining
a
room
occupied
by
petitioner
nebbia.
then,
over
the
next
couple
of
days,
the
agents
heard
various
things
which
were
testified
to
at
the
trial
and
which
if
believed,
were
damaging.
now,
the
agents
say
that
they
put
their
bug
in
their
own
room
rather
than
in
nebbia's
room
and
that
they
didn't
penetrate
nebbia's
enclosure
or
close
in
anyway,
that
they
laid
the
microphone,
the
listening
device,
at
the
bottom
of
the
door
of
their
own
room
where
there
was
a
small
aperture.
then,
beyond
that
door
was
an
air
space
of
a
few
inches
and
then
a
door
nebbia's
room,
the
typical
double
door
arrangement
that
you
get
in
some
of
the
better
class
hotels.
the
agents
claim,
in
other
words,
a
completely
non-trespassory
and
non-physically
intrusive
type
of
monitoring.
now,
i
--
this
is
only
the
second
time
i've
ever
argued
before
this
court,
and
the
last
time
was
more
than
20
years
ago.
i
don't
know
the
amenities.
am
i
permitted
to
hand
up
for
those
or
to
the
clerk?
mr.
abraham
glasser
there
are
some
photos
here,
which
are
government
exhibit,
showing
illici
--
showing
the
way
this
was
done.
mr.
abraham
glasser
one
of
those
photos
shows
a
towel
draped
over
the
--
over
something.
what
it's
draped
over,
the
testimony
shows,
is
straightly
over
the
microphone.
mr.
abraham
glasser
yes.
i
have
something
else
that
wasn't
in
court
which
i
hope
your
honor
will
look
at,
but
that's
a
general
publication.
i
might
mention
that
right
now,
as
a
matter
of
fact.
there
was
intense
dispute
at
the
trial
and
even
more
intense
dispute
at
the
appeal
as
to
whether
the
agents
had
told
the
truth
as
to
how
they
put
in
this
listening
device.
however,
at
the
trial,
at
the
pretrial
motion
to
suppress,
the
district
judge
ruled
that
he
believed
the
agents
and
that
there
was
no
trespass
and
no
illegality
of
any
kind
of
the
monitoring.
then,
on
the
appeal,
in
restudying
the
whole
thing
for
the
appeal,
we
saw
that
--
we
saw
that
there
was
more,
that
there
was
not
just
smoke
but
fire.
we
felt
that
we
were
discerning
suspicious
items
in
the
record
that
really
require
further
scrutiny
--
mr.
abraham
glasser
i
have
left
that
out
but
--
mr.
abraham
glasser
yes.
mr.
abraham
glasser
that's
correct,
your
honor.
i
did
believe
that
out
and
i'm
sorry
but,
of
course,
we
don't
think
that
that
matters.
we
don't
think
that
hurts
our
case,
that
judge
palmieri
did
that
because
we
think
the
agents
didn't
show
judge
palmieri
what
they
had
actually
done
the
preceding
december.
mr.
abraham
glasser
yes,
it
has,
but
we
have
briefed
it
here
in
a
way
that
we
think
entitles
us
to
have
this
court
consider
it
on
review.
now,
i
was
saying
that
when
we
got
to
appeal
time
in
this
case,
in
the
court
of
appeals,
we
went
out
and
we
hired
--
for
the
first
time,
we
hired
an
electronic
consultant.
we
hired
the
one
that
we,
after
inquiring,
we
thought
was
the
best
one
in
the
country.
the
government
has
disparaged
this
man's
qualifications.
his
name
is
bernard
spindel
and
i
have
here,
if
the
court
would
wish
to
receive
them,
three
issues
of
a
life
magazine
article
about
a
year
ago
--
about
two
years
ago,
featuring
spindel
as
the
top
number
one
electronic
expert
in
the
country.
the
article
is
interesting
anyway
and
i
don't
know
whether
the
court
would
wish
to
have
it,
but
if
they
do,
if
the
court
would
wish
to
have
this,
i
would
like
to
hand
these
to
the
clerk
also.
mr.
abraham
glasser
this
is
not
in
the
record.
mr.
abraham
glasser
all
right.
i'll
give
the
government
a
copy.
our
point
is,
in
offering
something
like
this
and
in
my
point
in
arguing
it,
is
that
there's
not
much
doubt
in
my
mind
that
one
of
the
reasons
we
didn't
get
more
credence
to
our
demonstrations
of
dubious
truthfulness
on
the
part
of
the
agents
was
that
our
electronic
expert
was
not
credited
as
being
an
expert.
it
seems
to
me
there
were
just
a
bit
of
a
--
well,
i
don't
mean
to
use
an
impertinent
term,
a
bit
of
stubbornness
about
conceding
that
a
fellow
with
a
flamboyant
kind
of
style
like
that,
a
flamboyant
placed
in
society
could
also
be
an
authentic
scientific
expert,
which
we
maintain
he
is.
now,
--
mr.
abraham
glasser
i
am
arguing
the
credibility
of
the
narcotic
agent
witnesses
in
the
motion
to
suppress
hearing.
i'm
arguing
that
to
this
court
because
we
consider
that
the
indications
are
overwhelming,
that
the
agents
could
not
have
been
telling
the
truth,
and
that
in
the
schipani
--
what
we
call
the
schipani
review
procedure,
that
there
is
always
open
the
duty
and
the
possibility
of
new
appellant
scrutiny
where
there
has
been
trespassory
eavesdropping.
if
it
hadn't
been
for
schipani
and
black
and
that
whole
course
of
decisions,
and
the
department
of
justice
own
very
gracious
program
which
was
started
during
mr.
justice
marshall's
time.
oh,
i
see
he's
not
on
the
bench.
well,
if
it
hadn't
been
for
schipani,
we
would
have
very
faint
hope
of
interesting
this
court
in
this
contention
addressed
to
the
credibility
of
the
narcotic
agents.
but,
with
schipani
in
the
picture,
we
think
it
would
be
perfectly
normal
and
right
and
necessary
for
the
court
to
hear
us
in
that
argument
and
to
determine
whether
we're
--
whether
our
argument
is
--
has
--
carries
any
persuasion.
mr.
abraham
glasser
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
abraham
glasser
we
would
contend
--
we
would
be
content
to
--
well,
here,
we
made
motions
and
filed
affidavits
in
the
circuit
court
of
appeal
--
in
the
court
of
appeals
during
dependency
of
the
appeal
asking
them
to
pick
up
the
schipani
task.
schipani
have
come
down
in
december
1966.
we
were
arguing
before
the
court
of
appeals
during
the
months
of
january,
february,
march.
we
were
bombarding
them
with
motions
and
affidavits
asking
them
to
entertain
a
schipani
review.
and
--
mr.
abraham
glasser
asking
--
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
abraham
glasser
i'm
sorry,
did
the
government
--
mr.
abraham
glasser
did
the
government
acknowledge
illegal
bugging?
yes.
mr.
abraham
glasser
no.
mr.
abraham
glasser
no,
but
i
guess
i
have
to
really
call
a
space
--
spade
then.
see,
we
think
the
narcotic
agents
must
have
deceived
the
department
of
justice.
we're
sure
the
department
of
justice
is
not,
in
complicity,
anything
wrong
here.
we're
positive
of
that.
i'm
not
just
saying
that
to
be
diplomatic.
we're
convinced
of
that,
but
we
do
think
that
there
has
been
--
we
do
think
there
has
not
been
--
we
think
the
presumption
of
official
regularity
is
not
justified
here
on
a
showing
that
we've
made.
now,
about
--
mr.
abraham
glasser
nothing
to
our
claim
that
the
--
mr.
abraham
glasser
if
you
accept
the
findings
of
judge
palmieri,
there
is
nothing
to
our
bugging
claim.
mr.
abraham
glasser
of
course.
we
are
asking
that
the
court
apply
the
schipani
and
general
fourth
amendment
scrutiny
powers
that
the
court
brought
into
operation
in
those
cases
during
the
year
--
during
the
second
half
of
1966,
in
which
the
department
of
justice
has
been
cooperating
--
in
which
the
department
has
been
cooperating
with
the
court.
now
--
and
i
might,
at
this
point,
interject.
there's
president
johnson's
order
of
june
30,
1965.
now,
there
have
been
references
to
such
an
order
in
papers
filed
by
the
solicitor
general's
office
in
this
court
in
a
number
of
certiorari
situations,
references
to
the
president's
order
as
having
called
upon
the
entire
federal
establishment
to
review
whether
they
had
been
engaging
in
any
illegal
electronic
activity.
that's
about
as
far
as
one
can
determine
from
the
government's
descriptions
of
the
president's
order,
what
that
order
contained.
now,
we've
been
trying
for
a
long
time
to
get
the
contents
of
that
order.
the
government
has
still
not
told
us
the
contents
of
that
order.
we
think
that
if
there
was
a
presidential
order
which
was
disobeyed
by
narcotic
agents,
that
they
are
acting
ultra
vires
and
that
if
there
couldn't
be
a
more
classic
instance
of
the
violation
of
due
process
of
law,
then
to
be
under
process
which
has
no
law
in
it
whatever,
that
is,
a
usurpational
subordinate
of
employee
of
the
federal
government
of
the
executive
branch.
invading
privacy
is
violating
not
only
the
fourth
amendment,
but
due
process
of
law.
we
think
the
president's
order
should
be
--
we
hope
that
this
court
will
see
fit
to
ask
the
solicitor
general
to
disclose
the
contents
of
the
president's
order.
now,
there
again,
off
the
record,
i
have
a
copy
of
what
purports
to
be
the
--
i've
had
it
since
last
december.
i
want
to
be
frank
with
the
court.
i
don't
know
whether
i'm
allowed
to
have
it.
desist
sent
it
to
me
from
jail.
i
don't
know
where
he
got
it.
it
reads
to
me
very,
very
con
--
it
has
perfect
versatility
to
it.
it
--
it's
authentic.
i've
been
--
i
was
--
i
know
government
writing.
i've
been
in
the
executive
branch
as
a
writer.
it
--
it's
written.
it's
not
--
it
sounds
real.
now,
if
it
--
if
the
actual
order
is
like
this
one
that
i've
got,
there
will
be
another
brief
filed
--
still
another
brief
filed
in
this
case
by
us.
mr.
abraham
glasser
president
johnson
is
said
by
the
solicitor
general
in
the
black
memorandum,
in
the
schipani
memorandum,
and
in
one
other
memorandum
that
were
filed
in
memorandum
which
was
filed
in
this
court
in
which
the
solicitor
general
was
working
out
his
own
new
approach
in
connection
with
electronic
monitoring.
he
said,
there's
a
presidential
order
of
june
30,
1965
addressed
to
the
entire
federal
establishment
calling
us
all
to
different
standards
of
conduct
in
connection
with
electronic
monitoring.
and,
there
are
a
few
other
clues.
one
clue
is
that
the
president
really
only
wanted
it
done
for
--
where
national
security
was
attacked.
he
only
wanted
it
done
with
advanced
permission
and
approval
of
each
instance
from
the
attorney
general.
he
didn't
want
any
wire
tapping
apparently
at
all.
mr.
abraham
glasser
the
significance
of
this
is
that
the
president's
order
is
june
30,
1965,
the
bugging
in
our
case
is
december
1965.
the
significance
would
be
that
the
bugging
disobeyed
the
president's
order.
mr.
abraham
glasser
if
it
did,
it
is
usurpational.
we
contend
then
--
mr.
abraham
glasser
we
were
practically
tender
a
federalist
paper
on
that
point.
the
point
we
deem
to
be
so
fundamental
that
we
would
--
we
wish
we
could
write.
mr.
abraham
glasser
executive
power.
the
executive
power
of
the
united
states
is
vested
in
a
president.
the
president
has
an
executive
power,
not
his
subordinates
have
it,
except
as
far
as
he
delegates
it
to
them.
when
they
exercise
the
power
to
see
that
the
laws
are
faithfully
executed,
the
power
to
enforce
the
laws,
in
the
president's
name
and
it
is
an
enforcement
action
which
the
president
has
strictly
forbidden
them
to
take,
aren't
they
usurpers?
i
don't
mean
to
call
names
but,
i
mean,
we
have
to
--
i'm
using
classic
terms
here.
mr.
abraham
glasser
oh,
yes,
entirely
so,
and
it
has
been
pretty
heavily
briefed.
i
--
sorry,
i
keep
talking
about
the
people
i
--
i'm
aware
of
my
--
i
would
like
to
stop
now
and
save
my
remaining
five
minutes
for
rebuttal,
if
i
may.
mr.
abraham
glasser
thank
you,
your
honor.
the
kolod-alderisio
problem
in
our
case
would
exist
only
in
relation
to
the
florida
bugging.
we
agree
with
the
government.
there's
no
real
issue
on
florida,
but
there
is
a
very
severe
issue,
we
say,
in
connection
with
an
allegedly
abortive
additional
bugging
in
georgia.
i
haven't
spoken
of
that
today.
we've
briefed
it
pretty
completely,
and
i
would
ask
the
court
to
watch
for
that
item
since
there
was
some
animation
here
at
the
end
about
the
kolod
problem
which
i
think
it
is
currently
before
the
court.
now
--
mr.
abraham
glasser
they
--
the
agent
who
ran
it
said
he
didn't
get
the
tape,
and
i
think
one
other
agent
who
was
in
the
car
with
him
said
they
didn't
get
any
effective
audible
results.
but,
again,
we
had
a
very
hard
pushing
hearing
in
which
i,
for
one,
can
wait,
feeling
that
i
was
entitled
to
make
a
strong
appellate
point
against
the
credibility
of
those
agents
on
that
issue
too.
and,
indeed,
on
that
issue
above
all,
they
were
crawling
all
over
that
part
of
georgia.
they
were
there
about
to
score,
and
they
were
not
hesitating
to
bug.
they
were
bugging
all
over
the
country.
we
think
we
can't
prove
that
they
were
bugging
in
europe.
these
fellows
lived
with
bugs.
it's
incredible
to
me
that
they
didn't
have
more
than
that
one
abortive
car
bug
in
georgia.
they
must
have
bugged
desist's
room.
i'm
speaking
of
perhaps
--
well,
all
right,
i'll
drop
that
point
for
now
because
it's
been
thoroughly
briefed.
our
whole
submission
is
sufficiently
stated
in
the
briefs.
now,
on
fuller,
again,
may
i
say
something
that
is
--
have
been
abrupt.
we
think
this
court
should
withdraw
its
action
in
fuller
on
the
ground
that
certiorari
there
was
improvidently
granted
and
i'd
like
to
say
why.
we've
covered
it
thoroughly
in
our
last
brief.
fuller
involved
a
telegram,
we
all
know
that,
but
back
of
that
telegram
was
a
subpoena.
the
police
in
fuller
were
not
defiant
or
willful
towards
existing
law.
the
police
in
fuller
went
to
the
alaska
communications
body,
whatever
it's
called,
got
voluntary
relinquishment
of
the
telegram
from
that
body
pursuant
to
a
federal
regulation
and
they
also
got
a
subpoena.
now,
the
exact
details
of
that
whole
subpoena
picture,
i
don't
know
for
sure
of
myself
because
i
haven't
seen
the
fuller
record
but
i've
been
guided
through
it
in
consultation
in
clause,
consultation
with
one
of
the
fuller
certiorari
counsel.
i
have
the
page
numbers.
this
is
covered
in
our
last
brief.
now,
if
there
was
a
subpoena
in
fuller
for
that
telegram,
how
can
your
honors
reach
the
question
in
fuller
of
a
violation
of
605
because
the
very
first
sentence
of
605
provides
for
subpoenas
nor,
at
least
colorably
and
subject
to
a
closer
scrutiny
of
the
record
in
fuller
than
--
which
your
honors
may
well
wish
to
do
because
fuller
is
a
pretty
drastic
decision,
and
to
render
a
drastic
decision
like
fuller
on
a
record
that
may
not
stand
up
under
scholarly
criticism
one
of
these
days,
i
would
think
would
be
something
that
the
court
that
wish
to
hear
about.
mr.
abraham
glasser
the
alaska
court
never
--
mr.
abraham
glasser
never
touch
this
problem
that
i'm
talking
about
now.
oh,
well,
they
touched
the
605
problem.
mr.
abraham
glasser
yes,
they
touched
the
605,
but
they
didn't
touch
the
problem
of
subpoena
pursuant
to
605.
mr.
abraham
glasser
they
held
that
--
let
me
think.
now,
wait
a
minute.
mr.
abraham
glasser
they
--
oh,
they
held
that
605
does
not
apply
to
states
that
they
adopted
the
basic
schwartz
line.
mr.
abraham
glasser
now,
i
have
here
a
copy
of
the
alaska
opinion.
well,
i
suppose
your
honor
really
want
to
see
it
right
this
minute,
do
you?
mr.
abraham
glasser
alright.
mr.
abraham
glasser
i'm
sorry
that
my
recollection
is
fuzzy
on
that.
i'm
pretty
sure
it
was
the
--
well,
i
said
the
schwartz
approach.
now,
on
katz
on
pre-katz
versus
what
the
law
was
or
what
it
became
in
view
of
katz
--
oh,
my
time
has
--
is
expired.
i'm
sorry.
your
honor,
mr.
markowitz
asked
me
and
i
told
him
i
would
ask
you.
can
he
argue
for
five
minutes?
