justice
thurgood
marshall
i
don’t
know
whether
they
count
this
or
not.
what’s
your
position
of
the
appeal
of
the
statute
and
give
the
judge
the
right
to
sentence
again.
without
more,
no
standards
and
no
everything,
in
arkansas?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
that’s
not
question.
justice
thurgood
marshall
my
question
was,
if
they
repealed
the
statute
and
reenact
the
statute
which
says
that
the
judge
has
the
sole
right
to
sentence
in
rape
cases
or
any
other
case,
period?
justice
thurgood
marshall
could
have
been.
justice
thurgood
marshall
why?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
would
offset
in
many
a
criminal
statute?
now
in
existence
or
do
you
limit
it
to
rape
cases.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
embezzlement.
the
judge
now
sentences
without
any
standards,
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes,
without
any
standards.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that
can
run
from
zero
to
a
hundred
years.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
exactly,
consecutive
sentences.
justice
thurgood
marshall
without
any
standards.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
limit
it
to
--
for
this
case
you
are
perfectly
right
to
limit
that
that
face
is?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
i
dont
see
why
you
should
go
further
than
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
langston,
is
there
any
allocution
out
in
arkansas
at
all?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
you
not
required?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
arkansas
does
not
normally
give
any
instruction
on
this
regarding
race?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
so,
they
don't
give
any
instructions
on
the
proper
person
to
be
sentenced
to
the
proper
number
of
years
or
anything
at
all
in
that
sense?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that's
left
after
the
“untrammeled
discretion”
of
the
jury?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
is
it
true
that
under
the
law
of
arkansas,
a
juror
can
use
any
whim
he
wants?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how
could
you
find
--
you
agreed
that
you
can
normally
find
abuse
of
discretion
from
a
judge,
can't
you?
was
there
in
anyway
to
find
abuse
of
discretion
from
the
jury?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
kind
of
hope
this
isn't.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
kind
of
hope
this
isn't.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
langston
i'm
confused.
the
jury
finds
a
man
guilty
of
crime
of
robbery
and
fixes
the
sentence
of
20
years.
and
the
judge
calls
him
in
and
said,
“do
you
have
anything
to
say?”
well,
what
can
the
judge
do,
regardless
of
what
the
man
says?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
is
the
reason
for
saying,
“what
do
you
have
to
say
before
i
give
you
the
sentence,
which
i'm
going
to
give
you?”
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
effect?
i'm
asking
you
what
effect
could
it
have.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
the
judge
couldn't
change
the
sentence,
does
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
then
the
jury
doesn't
then
finally
fix
the
sentence?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
judge
could
that
on
a
motion
for
a
new
trial,
couldn't
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
he
do
it
in
this
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
he
give
him
any
chance
to
speak
in
this
case,
after
the
jury
came
in?
justice
thurgood
marshall
when
was
the
statute
enacted?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
--
you
don't
have
any
idea
and
you're
attorney
general
--
deputy
attorney
general,
and
you've
never
heard
of
it,
of
every
being
used?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
know
it's
never
interpreted?
justice
thurgood
marshall
once.
in
the
whole
history
of
the
state?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
talked
about
not
enough
evidence
to
support
a
death
penalty.
do
you
mean
not
enough
evidence
to
support
rape
one?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
mean
it's
enough
to
support
the
judgment,
not
the
sentence?
justice
thurgood
marshall
general
has
--
when
in
the
appellate
don't
they
have
right
too?
it's
easy
for
me,
we
saw
one
recently.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
right.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
harris,
your
brief
refers
throughout
to
your
standard
in
this
procedure
from
this
connection,
doesn't
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
standard
in
this
procedure
and
you
read
somewhere
in
the
language
of
this
court,
from
the
witherspoon
case,
as
i
read
your
brief.
that
a
juror
that
must
choose
between
life
imprisonment
and
capital
punishment
can
do
little
more
and
must
do
nothing
less
to
express
the
conscience
of
the
community
on
the
question
of
life
and
death.
that's
what
you
quoted.
justice
thurgood

in
