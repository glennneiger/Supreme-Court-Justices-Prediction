mr.
don
langston
may
it
please
the
court.
i
checked
this
transcript
out
of
the
supreme
court
clerk’s
office
in
arkansas
last
friday
with
the
specific
purpose
of
bringing
it
here
for
your
consideration.
and
i
will
lodge
it
with
the
clerk
but
i
do,
whenever
you’re
finished
with
it
i
would
like
for
him
to
return
it.
mr.
don
langston
like
for
him
to
return
it,
at
least
so
that
i
can
file
it
back
in
the
supreme
court.
mr.
don
langston
i
was
going
to
mention
about
--
mr.
don
langston
this
is
the
--
this
is
the
original
transcript
filed
in
the
arkansas
supreme
court
and
it
has
also
been
considered
by
this
court
on
certiorari
from
the
arkansas
supreme
court.
i
see
it
here
marked
on
it
"received
september
22,
1966,
office
of
the
clerk
supreme
court
of
the
united
states.”
in
arkansas,
we
have
five
crimes
which
we
--
which
our
legislature
has
determined
or
bad
enough
to
require
the
death
sentence.
they
--
those
are
murder
in
the
first
degree,
rape,
kidnapping,
treason,
and
burning
of
prisons
by
convicts.
our
law
ever
since
these
crimes
--
mr.
don
langston
burning
of
prisons
by
convicts.
mr.
don
langston
treason.
mr.
don
langston
in
arkansas
these
five
crimes
were
originally
punishable
by
death.
that
was
the
only
sentence.
it
was
automatic
on
the
finding
of
guilt
in
those
particular
cases
that
the
person
be
sentence
to
death.
but
in
1915,
our
legislature
saw
fit
to
allow
some
discretion
by
the
jury
and
enacted
the
statute
which
allows
the
jury
in
its
discretion
to
return
in
sentence,
a
life
sentence.
in
this
particular
case,
the
verdict
form
was
at
that
top
of
the
page
it
said,
“we
the
jury
found
the
defendant
not
guilty.”
the
second
form
was,
“we,
they
jury
have
found
the
defendant
guilty
of
rape
and
fixed
his
punishment
at
life
imprisonment.”
the
third
form
was,
“we,
the
jury
found
the
defendant
guilty
as
charged
in
the
information.”
and
when
the
jury
brought
in,
the
verdict
saying,
“we,
the
jury
found
the
defendant
guilty
of
rape
as
charged
in
the
information”
that
ended
their
proceedings.
it
was
then
mandatory
upon
the
judge
to
--
under
the
law
to
sentence
the
defendant
to
death.
mr.
don
langston
your
honor,
we
didn’t
--
mr.
don
langston
of
course,
one,
he
can
--
when
a
motion
for
new
trial
is
filed
for
the
defendant,
he
can
grant
his
motion
for
a
new
trial
and
give
him
a
complete
new
trial.
we
didn’t
cite
it
in
our
brief
that
--
mr.
don
langston
i
believe
that
the
defendant
could
probably
say
in
his
motion
for
new
trial
that
the
judgment
is
contrary
to
law
and
that
it
is
excessive
and
that
would
be
an
error.
mr.
don
langston
that
would
be
an
error.
mr.
don
langston
that
the
judgment
is
contrary
to
law
and
that
it
is
excessive.
mr.
don
langston
i
think
that
under
that
he
could
set
it
aside
just
being
arbitrary.
i
don’t
see
any
recourse
that
the
state
would
have
in
appealing
case
with
the
supreme
court
of
arkansas
on
his
judgment
or
setting
it
aside.
mr.
don
langston
there
is
nothing
on
the
motion
for
new
trial
your
honor.
there’s
no
case
--
reported
cases
on
that.
we
do.
i
was
going
to
give
you
a
second
statute
which
i
think
would
give
the
judge
the
authority
to
reduce
the
sentence.
it’s
never
been
passed
on
by
our
supreme
court
and
we
didn’t
cite
it
in
our
brief
and
its
43.
it’s
arkansas
statute
43-2310.
that
statute
reads,
i
have
it
here
before
me,
it
reads,
“the
courts,
this
is
the
trial
court,
shall
have
the
power
in
all
cases
of
conviction
to
reduce
the
extent
or
duration
of
the
punishment
assessed
by
jury
if
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
the
conviction
is
proper
and
the
punishment
assessed
is
greater
than
under
the
circumstances
of
the
case
ought
to
be
inflicted
so
that
the
punishment
be
not
in
any
case
reduced
below
the
limit
prescribed
by
law
in
such
cases.”
that
statute
does
appear
to
give
him
the
power
to
reduce
the
sentence
to
life
imprisonment
and
if
he
so
desires.
it’s
never
been
passed
on
by
our
court.
mr.
don
langston
i
would
imagine
that
it
has
never
been
exercised.
i
wouldn’t
want
to
speculate
on
that
but
ordinarily
our
judges
follow
what
the
jury
says.
they’re
elected
in
arkansas
and
i
imagine
they
wouldn’t
want
to
go
around
setting
aside
jury
verdicts
because
it
would
look
bad.
mr.
don
langston
in
the
eyes
of
the
community
which
he
is
serving
and
has
to
run
for
re-election
every
four
years.
mr.
amsterdam
said
something
about
impeachment
in
his
--
impeachment
of
a
defendant
who
takes
a
stand
when
he
was
--
when
he
testifies
in
his
own
behalf
and
i
believe
he
went
further
than
arkansas
procedure
allows.
on
impeachment,
you
can’t
ask
him
about
all
kinds
of
bad
conduct
but
if
he
denies
it
you
are
bound
by
his
answer.
you
cannot.
you
cannot
introduce
independent
evidence
of
that
bad
conduct.
you
have
to
live
with
his
answer.
mr.
don
langston
i
imagine
it
would,
your
honor.
we
think
that
the
arkansas,
that
the
standards
in
arkansas
death
cases
our
sit
by
the
statute
whenever
in
a
rape
case
whenever
the
jury
finds
that
a
defendant
has
carnal
knowledge
of
a
female
forcibly
and
against
her
will
that
it
can
bring
him
the
death
sentence.
those
standards
are
the
elements
of
the
crime.
now
in
its
mercy
the
jury
can
bring
him
life
imprisonment.
but
i
would
do
want
to
emphasize
that
the
made
--
that
the
penalty
actually
is
death
and
not
life
imprisonment.
and
that
appears
that
the
arkansas
procedures
sort
of
reverse
from
some
of
these
others.
in
california,
theirs
is
the
ultimate
but
ours
is
the
mandatory
sentence
of
death
but
with
the
statute,
the
jury
can
its
discretion
recommend
life
imprisonment
with
the
judge
must
abide
by.
now
in
arkansas,
same
when
the
crime
of
larceny
which
carries
a
penalty
from
1
to
21
years,
all
that
the
jury
has
before
them
is
the
evidence
in
the
definition
of
the
elements
of
larceny
and
they
can
sit
that
punishment
at
any
point
in
that
extent
of
time
they
want
to.
there
--
the
prosecutor
gets
up
there
and
argues
that
he
ought
to
have
21
years.
the
defense
gets
up
there
and
argues
that
he
ought
to
get
the
minimum
sentence.
and
the
jury
then
sets
it
somewhere
in
between
that.
it
appears
from
my
reading
of
the
federal
statutes
that
there’s
procedure
in
death
sentences
as
the
same
as
it
is
in
arkansas,
that
they
have
a
unitary
jury
at
one
jury,
and
that
they
bring
in
the
verdict
of
guilt
and
fix
the
punishment
at
the
same
time.
so
what
appears
to
us
that
if
the
arkansas
statutes
are
stricken
down
by
this
court
that
the
federal
rule
would
also
follow
with
it.
in
this
case
and
the
transcript
going
back
to
the
witherspoon
argument
that
the
jury
is
the
conscience
of
the
community
and
that
is
a
sort
of
a
standard.
the
court’s
instruction
in
number
2
on
page
3
(a)
of
this
transcript
be
among
other
things
tells
him
that
in
reaching
your
verdict
exercise
your
judgment,
your
common
sense
and
reason
in
passing
a
bonus
case
and
give
the
testimony
of
any
and
all
witnesses
such
weight
as
you
think
it
is
entitled
to
and
let
your
verdict
be
in
accordance
with
the
truth
and
the
law.
when
the
state
proved
that
this
person
intruded.
when
the
state
proved
that
maxwell
entered
into
his
victim’s
home,
beat
her
up,
drove
her
across
the
street,
and
attacked
her
in
the
vacant
lot
in
the
state
proved
the
case
for
death.
the
only
was
he
can
get
anything
less
is
for
the
jury
to
exercise
mercy
which
he
had
declined
to
do
under
the
facts
of
this
case.
mr.
don
langston
well,
of
course
i
think
that
the
jury,
i
don’t
know
whether
this
answers
your
question
or
not,
but
i
don’t
think
the
jury
can
live
its
conscience
outside
of
the
jury
box.
i
think
they
take
everything
in
their
boxes
or
prejudices.
mr.
don
langston
of
course
we
don’t
--
we
think
that
the
standard
is
said
in
the
statute
and
we
don’t
see
how
you
could
draft
to
set
the
standards
that
would
tell
the
jury
what
to
do
in
each
particular
case,
i
think
the
legislature
to
adopt
standards
would
have
to
be
in
session
all
the
time
and
enact
almost
ex
post
facto
laws
to
cover
every
situation
and
that
is
what
are
our
argument
is
that
the
only
thing
that
you
could
--
we
don’t
think
whether
to
use
a
weapon
or
whatever
you
do
makes
any
difference.
we
think
that
the
evidence
before
the
jury
that
that
is
the
standard
that
they’re
going
to
go
by
is
the
evidence
that
is
presented
in
the
case.
there
are
no
further
questions,
that’s
our
case.
mr.
don
langston
he
wrote
in
1785
originally.
now,
of
course
weighing
indeed
go
about
it
was
a
simply
cut
back
more
and
more.
they
first
of
all
removed
the
death
penalty
for
stealing
from
bleaching
grounds
and
then
for
pickpocketing
and
then
for
taking
(inaudible)
and
what
have
you.
until
they
got
it
down
eventually
to
murder
and
then
in
1957
notwithstanding
the
real
commissions
recommendation
which
the
california
cites
in
its
brief
saying
it
was
very
difficult
to
get
down
any
narrower
as
a
matter
of
category
english
went
ahead
again.
in
1957,
and
delimited
capital
punishment
by
categories.
now,
the
only
other
thing
i
think
need
to
answer
--
mr.
don
langston
it
was
done
by
parliament.
mr.
don
langston
may
it
please
the
court.
as
the
eight
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
said
when
it
was
before
them
that
guilt
or
innocence
is
not
an
issue
in
this
case.
our
state's
supreme
court
has
held
in
this
case
that
the
evidence
made
an
overwhelming
fashion,
all
of
the
requirements
for
conviction,
for
the
offensive
rape,
as
it
was
defined
in
1962.
of
course,
our
rape
statute
has
been
changed,
since
that
time
in
1967,
it
was
changed
for
three
degrees
of
rape,
and
the
penalty
was
changed
for
first
degree
rape,
which
this
would
have
fit
into,
if
it
has
occurred
after
1967.
the
new
penalty
for
rape,
first-degree
rape
is
30
years
to
life
or
death,
in
the
discretion
of
the
jury,
which
this
offense
would
fall
into.
the
facts
of
this
particular
case
do
not
appear
to
be
an
issue
that
as
the
eight
circuit
characterized
it,
that
the
circumstances
of
this
crime,
as
usual
are
sorted.
a
few
of
the
background
facts
is
that
on
november
3,
1961,
in
the
early
morning
of
--
in
that
early
morning,
a
35-year-old
white
woman
was
brutally
beaten
and
raped
by
the
petitioner
in
this
case.
and
her
90-year-old
helpless
father
was
also
beaten.
she
was
then
dragged
to
the
vacant
lot
down
the
street
and
attacked.
we
feel
that
guilt
or
innocence
is
not
an
issue
in
this
case
as
are
other
issues,
which
mr.
amsterdam
has
mentioned
in
his
brief
and
his
oral
argument
here.
in
arkansas,
there
are
five
offenses,
which
are
punishable
by
death.
one
is
kidnapping,
also
rape,
murder
in
the
first
degree,
a
treason,
and
burning
of
prisons
by
convicts.
as
originally
enacted
in
arkansas,
these
statutes
provided
automatically
for
the
death
penalty.
in
1915,
the
arkansas
legislature,
as
mr.
amsterdam
has
mentioned,
enacted
arkansas
statute
43-2153,
which
gave
the
jury
the
discretion
of
imposing
a
sentence
of
life
imprisonment,
instead
of
death.
now,
petitioner
and
some
of
briefs
that
were
filed
on
his
behalf
about
others
contend
that
the
death
penalty
should
be
voided
and
abolished
as
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
while
the
state
of
arkansas
recognizes
that
there
may
be
some
movement
in
that
direction,
that
issue
is
not
before
this
court.
mr.
don
langston
unanimous.
mr.
don
langston
unanimous,
your
honor.
mr.
don
langston
all
verdicts
of
criminal
cases
have
to
be
unanimous.
in
civil
cases,
nine
can
bring
in
a
verdict.
or
what
it's
worth
to
this
court,
in
1967,
a
bill
was
introduced
in
the
arkansas
legislature
to
abolish
capital
punishment,
public
hearings
were
held,
and
the
issues
were
debated,
and
the
bill
got
no
word,
it
wasn't
fitted
overwhelmingly.
also,
senses
kick
--
mr.
don
langston
i
don't
remember,
your
honor.
also,
since
this
case
was
argued
last
year,
there
had
been
some
eight
death
verdicts
returned
in
arkansas,
at
least
six
of
them
were
white
people,
two
of
them
were
black
people.
mr.
don
langston
the
vote
on
the
bill,
your
honor?
mr.
don
langston
all
right.
also,
in
this
case
in
the
briefs,
also
in
the
argument
here
today
about
mr.
amsterdam,
they
want
to
inject
the
issue
of
discrimination
and
race
in
this
case.
petitioners
and
some
of
the
briefs
filed
in
his
behalf
vote
a
lot
of
their
argument
on
this
point.
we
can
only
state
that
discrimination
and
imposition
of
this
death
penalty
was
advanced
by
petitioner
in
his
petition
for
certiorari,
and
was
rejected
by
this
court.
it
was
rejected
by
the
district
court.
it
was
also
rejected
by
the
eighth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
what
this
case
actually
concerns,
itself
with
is
the
validity
of
procedural
means
used
in
imposing
the
death
penalty
on
a
criminal
defendant,
whether
he
be
white
or
black.
we
contend
that
this
case
in
effect
really
involves
issue
of
whether
the
jury
system
is
a
workable
procedure
in
capital
cases.
mr.
don
langston
no,
your
honor.
mr.
don
langston
excuse
me?
mr.
don
langston
i
know
of
no
case
where
that
has
ever
been
requested
your
honor.
i've
read
it
in
some
of
these
briefs,
where
in
some
of
these
statistical
studies
that
from
the
transcripts
and
the
case
that
you
could
not
tell
the
race
of
the
victim
or
the
race
of
the
defendant.
mr.
don
langston
i
mean
you
can't
tell
it
from
the
transcript,
whenever
they
were
given
the
statistics
for
the
district
court
trial.
yes
sir,
the
jury
can
tell.
mr.
don
langston
that's
correct
your
honor.
the
decision
of
the
district
court
on
standards
held
that
the
untied
states
constitution
did
not
make
it
necessary
that
trial
courts
in
arkansas
charge
or
instruct
juries
regarding
standards
or
guidelines
to
guide
them
in
assessing
life
or
death.
the
court
reasoned
that
arkansas
procedure,
rested
the
decision,
in
the
discretion
of
the
jury
to
be
exercised
in
the
light
of
judgment,
common
sense,
and
experience
of
the
jurors,
and
the
jurors
are
presumed
to
be
persons
of
good
judgment
and
common
sense.
we
advance
that
argument
here
today
also
on
the
single
verdict
procedure,
the
district
court
held
that
while
some
states
may
have
split
verdicts.
no
court
has
held
or
it
does
not
think
that
is
constitutionally
required
that
any
court
have
a
split
verdict.
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
went
along
the
same
line.
it
rejected
the
petitioner's
contentions
in
these
cases,
and
we
recommend
that
opinion
to
this
court
in
deciding
this
case.
mr.
don
langston
yes
sir,
its
defined
in
the
jury
instructions
and
--
mr.
don
langston
it
would
be
in
the
jury
instruction.
we
have
filed
the
transcript
of
the
original
case
with
this
court.
i
suppose
it
still
has
it.
and
the
court
defines
rape.
mr.
don
langston
i
believe
that
they
are
separate
your
honor.
mr.
don
langston
no,
i
don't
recall,
because
we've
changed
our
rape
statute.
mr.
don
langston
alright,
your
honor.
since
this
case
argued
before
this
court,
some
federal
and
state
courts
have
decided
that
these
two
issues
against
the
petitioner.
and
we
recommend
those
cases
to
the
court.
they
are
cited
on
pages
31
and
32
of
petitioner's
supplemental
brief
to
enlarge
the
issues.
mr.
don
langston
no,
your
honor,
it
cannot.
if
you
plead
guilty,
the
jury
has
to
be
impaneled
and
the
state
puts
on
a
prima
facie
case.
mr.
don
langston
of
guilt,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
don
langston
ordinarily,
the
trial
would
be
very
short
and
just
enough
--
ordinarily,
it
would
be
probably
the
fact
that
in
a
murder
case
that
a
murder
has
occurred,
and
that
the
defendant
has
confessed
to
it.
mr.
don
langston
i
think
those
factors
are
quite
an
effort
for
the
jury
to
make
an
intelligent
position
on
punishment.
mr.
don
langston
that's
our
position,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
don
langston
in
felonies,
only
in
cases
where
the
jury
cannot
agree,
then
he
can
set
the
punishment.
what
they
had
--
mr.
don
langston
no,
your
honor,
we
do
not.
mr.
don
langston
that's
correct.
what
happens
is
the
jury
goes
out
and
decides
guilt
and
then
it
reports
back
to
the
judge
that
it
has
decided
on
guilt
or
innocence,
but
cannot
reach
a
verdict
on
punishment.
then
the
judge
takes
the
case
--
he
takes
the
verdict
of
guilt,
then
he
sets
the
punishment
--
punishment
within
statutory
limits.
mr.
don
langston
what's
he's
heard
is
what
the
jury
has
heard.
mr.
don
langston
there
is
a
statute
in
arkansas
that
whenever
a
person
is
sentenced
to
the
penitentiary
that
there
will
be
--
the
judge
will
send
along
with
the
prisoner
his
remarks,
the
prosecuting
attorney
will
send
his
remarks
along
with
it.
it
sort
of
a
presentence
report,
but
--
mr.
don
langston
that
is
correct.
mr.
don
langston
there
might
--
could
be
some,
under
the
statute
that
we
have
cited
if
when
the
defendant
would
file
a
motion
for
a
new
trial,
which
is
the
overruling
of
this
motion
is
what
you
appeal
from
in
arkansas
is
from
a
motion,
from
the
denial
of
your
motion
for
new
trial.
he
may
--
if
the
judge
in
his
discretion
wants
to,
he
may
hear
some
evidence
in
allocution,
but
i
don't
think
it's
very
common
in
arkansas.
mr.
don
langston
that's
correct.
mr.
don
langston
no,
your
honor,
it
do
not.
mr.
don
langston
that's
correct.
mr.
don
langston
ordinarily,
they
--
mr.
don
langston
it's
an
unfettered
discretion.
ordinarily
the
judge
instructs
them
on
--
mr.
don
langston
i
doubt
it,
your
honor.
mr.
don
langston
i
didn't
get
your
last
word?
mr.
don
langston
well,
we
think
that
discretion
of
the
jury
is
a
good
thing.
mr.
don
langston
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
don
langston
your
honor,
in
the
early
morning
hours
on
november
3,
1961,
the
defendant,
the
white
woman,
35-year-old
white
woman,
living
with
her
invalid
90-year-old
father,
heard
someone
trying
to
break
in
to
their
house.
she
went
to
the
door
and
told
the
man
to
leave,
and
said
she
would
call
the
police.
he
had
a
stocking
he
was
trying
to
pull
down
over
his
head.
so,
he
wouldn't
--
he
kept
advancing
toward
her,
so
she
got
on
the
telephone,
and
got
the
operator,
who
when
the
man
attacked
the
woman,
she
started
screaming,
so
the
operator
connected
the
telephone
with
the
police,
and
the
police
heard
the
screams
over
the
telephone
and
they
were
struggling
there.
her
invalid
father
came
in
to
assist
her.
the
defendant
put
his
hand
over
her
mouth,
she
bit
his
finger,
and
bit
his
hand.
mr.
don
langston
bit
the
defendant's
finger
and
his
hand.
his
father
could
not
help
her,
so
he
went
to
the
window
and
started
yelling
for
help.
of
course,
the
police
were
trying
to
locate
where
the
telephone
call
is
coming
from.
so
the
defendant
then
dragged
the
victim
from
her
house,
down
the
street
to
up
of
embankment,
up
to
a
vacant
lot.
there
were
cuts
and
bruises
on
her
feet,
she
was
in
her
pajamas.
and
there
were
cuts
all
over
and
they
struggling
up
there
in
the
lot,
and
he
threatened
to
kill
her,
if
she
told,
and
that's
basically
the
facts.
mr.
don
langston
he
beat
the
father
too,
and
so
the
father
said,
“i
just
can't
help
you
anymore,”
and
so
went
to
the
window
and
tried
to
yell
for
help.
and
he
dragged
the
victim
out
from
the
house.
mr.
don
langston
just
his
fist.
mr.
don
langston
90.
90
years
old.
and
he
was
an
invalid.
mr.
don
langston
no,
sir.
mr.
don
langston
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
don
langston
that's
correct.
mr.
don
langston
that's
correct.
mr.
don
langston
no,
your
honor,
he
can't
do
that
in
capital
cases,
you
cannot
do
that.
mr.
don
langston
that's
correct.
mr.
don
langston
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
i
don't
know
of
any
--
i
do
not
know
of
any
case
that
would
hold
that.
mr.
don
langston
i
believe
your
correct.
mr.
don
langston
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
that
they
have
any
allocution
in
our
state
courts.
mr.
don
langston
that's
correct.
mr.
don
langston
i
wasn't
aware
of
it,
mr.
amsterdam
we
do,
but
i
wasn't
aware
of
the
allocation
statute.
mr.
don
langston
i
do
not
--
i
didn't
--
i
don't
know
of
the
statute
that
says.
mr.
don
langston
i
know
that
--
i've
tried
some
criminal
cases
and
it's
never
done.
mr.
don
langston
well,
whatever
he
sentence
--
whenever
he
sentences,
your
honor.
mr.
don
langston
your
honor,
he
brings
in
a
judgment,
if
the
judge
is
trying
it
himself,
trial
before
the
court,
he
brings
in
the
judgment.
of
course,
and
he
waits
the
statutory,
the
limit
of
time
before
he
sentences
him,
then
he
does
asked
him
he
has
anything
to
say
in
his
behalf
or
nearly
nothing
he's
saying.
mr.
don
langston
yes,
yes
sir.
mr.
don
langston
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
mr.
don
langston
yes,
sir.
mr.
don
langston
48
hours.
mr.
don
langston
of
course,
this
can
--
mr.
don
langston
by
statute
in
arkansas,
you
have
to
wait
48
hours
before
you
can
sentence
a
person
--
mr.
don
langston
the
jury
fixes
the
sentence,
i
mean
the
jury
fixes
the
punishment,
the
judgment
is
in
and
on
that
verdict
and
then
--
mr.
don
langston
no,
your
honor.
mr.
don
langston
yes,
sir.
mr.
don
langston
no,
they
always
asked
them.
the
judge
always
asked,
whenever
he
sentences
in
any
trial,
he
ask
if
he
has
anything
to
say
before
sentence
is
passed.
mr.
don
langston
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
don
langston
there
are
several,
newly
discovered
evidence,
any
errors
occurred
during
trial.
mr.
don
langston
and
put
on
evidence.
mr.
don
langston
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
don
langston
of
course,
he
could
set
the
verdict
decide
if
he
desires.
mr.
don
langston
your
honor,
i
just
know
that
that's
done.
i
don't
know
that
it
has
any
effect
at
all
or
(voice
overlap).
mr.
don
langston
i
suppose
that
anything
he
said
that
would
be
relevant
to
his
sentence
could
be
said.
mr.
don
langston
the
43-2310
says,
that
if
the
judge,
in
cases
of
conviction,
doesn't
think
that
the
punishment
sentence
is
correct,
he
has
the
power
to
reduce
the
extent
or
duration
of
the
sentence.
mr.
don
langston
in
effect,
in
arkansas
the
jury
it
does.
mr.
don
langston
as
far
as
i
know
what's
never
been
interpreted
--
mr.
don
langston
yes,
sir.
mr.
don
langston
your
honor,
it's
never
been
interpreted
by
our
supreme
court
--
mr.
don
langston
i
haven't
found
any
cases
on
it,
but
i
have
been
told
by
some
judges
that
it
has
been
done.
mr.
don
langston
yes,
sir.
mr.
don
langston
that's
correct.
your
honor.
mr.
don
langston
i
believe
he
could,
your
honor.
mr.
don
langston
i
am
advised
that
it
has
been
done
but
the
case
didn't
go
to
the
supreme
court,
maybe
there
was
something
in
the
trial
that
the
judge
was
--
i
don't
know
what
it
could
have
occurred
during
the
trial,
but
the
judge
thought
on
motion
of
the
defendant
that
he
should
reduce
it
from
death
down
to
life,
and
that
it
has
been
done.
mr.
don
langston
no,
your
honor.
mr.
don
langston
i
don't
recall
whether
he
did
or
not.
mr.
don
langston
that's
what
the
statute
it
appears
to
say,
your
honor,
43-2310.
mr.
don
langston
the
court
shall
have
power
in
all
cases
of
conviction
to
reduce
the
extent
or
duration
of
the
punishment
assessed
by
the
jury.
if
in
the
opinion
of
the
court,
the
conviction
is
proper,
and
the
punishment
assessed
is
greater
than
under
the
circumstances
of
the
case,
ought
to
be
inflicted,
so
that
the
punishment
be
not,
in
any
case,
reduced
below
the
limit
prescribed
by
law
in
such
cases.
mr.
don
langston
that's
what
i
argued
the
last
time
we
were
up
here,
but
there's
been
no
interpretation
by
our
supreme
court
of
this
statute.
and
it
would
appear
on
its
face,
to
allow
him
to
reduce
the
verdict
--
mr.
don
langston
i
don't
know
of
any
one,
your
honor.
i
don't
know
of
any
supreme,
arkansas
supreme
court
cases
on
it.
and
the
only
way
you
could
do
it
was
probably
to
survey
the
--
make
a
survey
of
the
circuit
judges
in
arkansas,
and
see
if
they
have
ever
done
it,
the
current
ones.
mr.
don
langston
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
don
langston
i
think
he
could,
your
honor.
mr.
don
langston
i
would
think
if
he
were
only
dissatisfied
with
the
sentence,
he
would
just
modify
it
and
not
have
a
complete
trial.
mr.
don
langston
i
would
believe
so,
your
honor.
mr.
don
langston
that's
my
interpretation
of
the
statute.
mr.
don
langston
no,
your
honor.
mr.
don
langston
that's
correct.
mr.
don
langston
i
suppose,
it's
been
in
the
revised
statutes,
chapter
45,
so
it's
--
it
is
as
old
as
the
--
i
imagine
it
was
back
whenever
the
arkansas
came
into
the
union.
mr.
don
langston
that's
correct.
mr.
don
langston
it's
never
been
interpreted
by
the
supreme
court.
i
have
been
advised
that
a
case
--
that
the
circuit
judge
has
reduced
them,
one
from
death
to
life.
mr.
don
langston
that's
all
i
know
of,
your
honor.
mr.
don
langston
i
don't
--
mr.
don
langston
not
that
i
know
of,
our
supreme
court
has
held
in
its
decision,
if
it
does
not
give
advisory
opinions,
only
when
there's
a
case
or
controversy.
mr.
don
langston
yes
sir,
your
honor.
mr.
don
langston
i
think
he
can,
your
honor.
mr.
don
langston
i
know
he
can,
yes
sir.
the
supreme
court
of
arkansas
as
the
petitioner's
cited
in
his
brief
says
that
the
supreme
court
of
arkansas
can
set
aside
a
death
verdict
whenever
there's
not
enough
evidence
to
support
it.
but
just
ordinarily,
they
can't
do
like
--
the
statute
here
says,
they
have
said
that
they
themselves
do
not
have
the
power,
unless
the
evidence
is
not
enough
to
support
the
change
--
mr.
don
langston
that's
correct.
mr.
don
langston
those
cases
--
mr.
don
langston
yes,
sir.
mr.
don
langston
that's
correct.
mr.
don
langston
no,
your
honor.
mr.
don
langston
the
court
enters
judgment
upon
the
verdict
of
the
jury,
which
is
entered.
mr.
justice
white
asked
mr.
amsterdam,
concerning
other
felonies
or
other
criminals
conduct
in
arkansas
standards.
we
believe
that
in
this
particular
case,
that
to
accept
their
argument,
that
standards
must
be
applied
in
capital
punishment
or
life
imprisonment
cases
that
are
set
for
the
jury
that
the
court
would
have
no
alternative,
but
to
order
standards
in,
say
cases
of
larceny
or
burglary,
and
arkansas
burglary
is
2
to
21
years,
larceny
is
1
to
21
years.
we
can
see
if
the
court
accepts
it
here
that
they
could
perhaps
--
they
would
perhaps
--
the
next
step
would
be
to
put
in
those
types
of
cases.
and
we
would
--
in
arkansas,
of
course,
we
would
almost
have
to
try
every
one
of
our
cases
over
again.
mr.
don
langston
yes,
sir.
mr.
don
langston
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
don
langston
that's
correct.
mr.
don
langston
yes,
sir.
mr.
don
langston
that's
correct.
only
single
verdict
procedure,
the
way
i
gathered
from
the
petitioner's
argument,
he
is
saying
that
either
one
he
would
have
a
separate
penalty
trial
with
the
same
jury
or
two,
he
would
have
a
separate
jury
for
penalty,
or
three,
that
he
would
have
the
judge
set
the
penalty
after
a
hearing
on
allocution.
we
submit
that
this
court
has
never
held
that
any
states
should
have
to
have
a
double
jury,
have
a
double
hearing
on
this
particular
aspect
or
case.
mr.
don
langston
that's
correct.
mr.
don
langston
he
is
treated
as
any
other
witness
would
be,
your
honor.
mr.
don
langston
he
can
be
asked
about
the
prior
acts
of
misconduct,
felony
convictions,
and
things
of
that
nature.
mr.
don
langston
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
don
langston
yes.
mr.
don
langston
the
judge
gives
a
cautionary
instruction
that
is
only
to
go
to
test
his
credibility
as
a
witness.
mr.
don
langston
that's
my
understanding
of
the
law,
your
honor.
mr.
don
langston
if
the
defendant
answers
in
the
negative,
that
ends
the
matter
though,
your
honor.
he
can't
come
back
and
introduce
independent
evidence
that
he
did,
do
these
acts.
he
must
take
his
answer.
mr.
don
langston
that's
correct,
he
must
take
his
answer,
he
cannot
come
back
and
introduce,
he
can
ask
him
if
he's
been
convicted
of
a
felony,
excuse
me,
has
been
guilty
of
acts
of
misconduct,
if
he
denies,
and
said
he
did
not,
and
he
can't
bring
in
a
witness
and
say,
“yes,
he
did
do
it.”
mr.
don
langston
these
--
the
cases
in
arkansas
sort
of
go
more
to
acts
of
misconduct,
toward
moral
turpitude
than
anything
else.
like
indecent
conduct
or
things
of
that
nature.
i
believe
--
mr.
don
langston
the
defendant
did
not
take
the
stand,
your
honor
in
this
case.
mr.
don
langston
no,
your
honor.
i
believe
i
turn
the
rest
the
case
over
to
mr.
harris.
mr.
don
langston
may
it
please
the
court.
i
checked
this
transcript
out
of
the
supreme
court
clerk’s
office
in
arkansas
last
friday
with
the
specific
purpose
of
bringing
it
here
for
your
consideration.
and
i
will
lodge
it
with
the
clerk
but
i
do,
whenever
you’re
finished
with
it
i
would
like
for
him
to
return
it.
mr.
don
langston
like
for
him
to
return
it,
at
least
so
that
i
can
file
it
back
in
the
supreme
court.
mr.
don
langston
i
was
going
to
mention
about
--
mr.
don
langston
this
is
the
--
this
is
the
original
transcript
filed
in
the
arkansas
supreme
court
and
it
has
also
been
considered
by
this
court
on
certiorari
from
the
arkansas
supreme
court.
i
see
it
here
marked
on
it
"received
september
22,
1966,
office
of
the
clerk
supreme
court
of
the
united
states.”
in
arkansas,
we
have
five
crimes
which
we
--
which
our
legislature
has
determined
or
bad
enough
to
require
the
death
sentence.
they
--
those
are
murder
in
the
first
degree,
rape,
kidnapping,
treason,
and
burning
of
prisons
by
convicts.
our
law
ever
since
these
crimes
--
mr.
don
langston
burning
of
prisons
by
convicts.
mr.
don
langston
treason.
mr.
don
langston
in
arkansas
these
five
crimes
were
originally
punishable
by
death.
that
was
the
only
sentence.
it
was
automatic
on
the
finding
of
guilt
in
those
particular
cases
that
the
person
be
sentence
to
death.
but
in
1915,
our
legislature
saw
fit
to
allow
some
discretion
by
the
jury
and
enacted
the
statute
which
allows
the
jury
in
its
discretion
to
return
in
sentence,
a
life
sentence.
in
this
particular
case,
the
verdict
form
was
at
that
top
of
the
page
it
said,
“we
the
jury
found
the
defendant
not
guilty.”
the
second
form
was,
“we,
they
jury
have
found
the
defendant
guilty
of
rape
and
fixed
his
punishment
at
life
imprisonment.”
the
third
form
was,
“we,
the
jury
found
the
defendant
guilty
as
charged
in
the
information.”
and
when
the
jury
brought
in,
the
verdict
saying,
“we,
the
jury
found
the
defendant
guilty
of
rape
as
charged
in
the
information”
that
ended
their
proceedings.
it
was
then
mandatory
upon
the
judge
to
--
under
the
law
to
sentence
the
defendant
to
death.
mr.
don
langston
your
honor,
we
didn’t
--
mr.
don
langston
of
course,
one,
he
can
--
when
a
motion
for
new
trial
is
filed
for
the
defendant,
he
can
grant
his
motion
for
a
new
trial
and
give
him
a
complete
new
trial.
we
didn’t
cite
it
in
our
brief
that
--
mr.
don
langston
i
believe
that
the
defendant
could
probably
say
in
his
motion
for
new
trial
that
the
judgment
is
contrary
to
law
and
that
it
is
excessive
and
that
would
be
an
error.
mr.
don
langston
that
would
be
an
error.
mr.
don
langston
that
the
judgment
is
contrary
to
law
and
that
it
is
excessive.
mr.
don
langston
i
think
that
under
that
he
could
set
it
aside
just
being
arbitrary.
i
don’t
see
any
recourse
that
the
state
would
have
in
appealing
case
with
the
supreme
court
of
arkansas
on
his
judgment
or
setting
it
aside.
mr.
don
langston
there
is
nothing
on
the
motion
for
new
trial
your
honor.
there’s
no
case
--
reported
cases
on
that.
we
do.
i
was
going
to
give
you
a
second
statute
which
i
think
would
give
the
judge
the
authority
to
reduce
the
sentence.
it’s
never
been
passed
on
by
our
supreme
court
and
we
didn’t
cite
it
in
our
brief
and
its
43.
it’s
arkansas
statute
43-2310.
that
statute
reads,
i
have
it
here
before
me,
it
reads,
“the
courts,
this
is
the
trial
court,
shall
have
the
power
in
all
cases
of
conviction
to
reduce
the
extent
or
duration
of
the
punishment
assessed
by
jury
if
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
the
conviction
is
proper
and
the
punishment
assessed
is
greater
than
under
the
circumstances
of
the
case
ought
to
be
inflicted
so
that
the
punishment
be
not
in
any
case
reduced
below
the
limit
prescribed
by
law
in
such
cases.”
that
statute
does
appear
to
give
him
the
power
to
reduce
the
sentence
to
life
imprisonment
and
if
he
so
desires.
it’s
never
been
passed
on
by
our
court.
mr.
don
langston
i
would
imagine
that
it
has
never
been
exercised.
i
wouldn’t
want
to
speculate
on
that
but
ordinarily
our
judges
follow
what
the
jury
says.
they’re
elected
in
arkansas
and
i
imagine
they
wouldn’t
want
to
go
around
setting
aside
jury
verdicts
because
it
would
look
bad.
mr.
don
langston
in
the
eyes
of
the
community
which
he
is
serving
and
has
to
run
for
re-election
every
four
years.
mr.
amsterdam
said
something
about
impeachment
in
his
--
impeachment
of
a
defendant
who
takes
a
stand
when
he
was
--
when
he
testifies
in
his
own
behalf
and
i
believe
he
went
further
than
arkansas
procedure
allows.
on
impeachment,
you
can’t
ask
him
about
all
kinds
of
bad
conduct
but
if
he
denies
it
you
are
bound
by
his
answer.
you
cannot.
you
cannot
introduce
independent
evidence
of
that
bad
conduct.
you
have
to
live
with
his
answer.
mr.
don
langston
i
imagine
it
would,
your
honor.
we
think
that
the
arkansas,
that
the
standards
in
arkansas
death
cases
our
sit
by
the
statute
whenever
in
a
rape
case
whenever
the
jury
finds
that
a
defendant
has
carnal
knowledge
of
a
female
forcibly
and
against
her
will
that
it
can
bring
him
the
death
sentence.
those
standards
are
the
elements
of
the
crime.
now
in
its
mercy
the
jury
can
bring
him
life
imprisonment.
but
i
would
do
want
to
emphasize
that
the
made
--
that
the
penalty
actually
is
death
and
not
life
imprisonment.
and
that
appears
that
the
arkansas
procedures
sort
of
reverse
from
some
of
these
others.
in
california,
theirs
is
the
ultimate
but
ours
is
the
mandatory
sentence
of
death
but
with
the
statute,
the
jury
can
its
discretion
recommend
life
imprisonment
with
the
judge
must
abide
by.
now
in
arkansas,
same
when
the
crime
of
larceny
which
carries
a
penalty
from
1
to
21
years,
all
that
the
jury
has
before
them
is
the
evidence
in
the
definition
of
the
elements
of
larceny
and
they
can
sit
that
punishment
at
any
point
in
that
extent
of
time
they
want
to.
there
--
the
prosecutor
gets
up
there
and
argues
that
he
ought
to
have
21
years.
the
defense
gets
up
there
and
argues
that
he
ought
to
get
the
minimum
sentence.
and
the
jury
then
sets
it
somewhere
in
between
that.
it
appears
from
my
reading
of
the
federal
statutes
that
there’s
procedure
in
death
sentences
as
the
same
as
it
is
in
arkansas,
that
they
have
a
unitary
jury
at
one
jury,
and
that
they
bring
in
the
verdict
of
guilt
and
fix
the
punishment
at
the
same
time.
so
what
appears
to
us
that
if
the
arkansas
statutes
are
stricken
down
by
this
court
that
the
federal
rule
would
also
follow
with
it.
in
this
case
and
the
transcript
going
back
to
the
witherspoon
argument
that
the
jury
is
the
conscience
of
the
community
and
that
is
a
sort
of
a
standard.
the
court’s
instruction
in
number
2
on
page
3
(a)
of
this
transcript
be
among
other
things
tells
him
that
in
reaching
your
verdict
exercise
your
judgment,
your
common
sense
and
reason
in
passing
a
bonus
case
and
give
the
testimony
of
any
and
all
witnesses
such
weight
as
you
think
it
is
entitled
to
and
let
your
verdict
be
in
accordance
with
the
truth
and
the
law.
when
the
state
proved
that
this
person
intruded.
when
the
state
proved
that
maxwell
entered
into
his
victim’s
home,
beat
her
up,
drove
her
across
the
street,
and
attacked
her
in
the
vacant
lot
in
the
state
proved
the
case
for
death.
the
only
was
he
can
get
anything
less
is
for
the
jury
to
exercise
mercy
which
he
had
declined
to
do
under
the
facts
of
this
case.
mr.
don
langston
well,
of
course
i
think
that
the
jury,
i
don’t
know
whether
this
answers
your
question
or
not,
but
i
don’t
think
the
jury
can
live
its
conscience
outside
of
the
jury
box.
i
think
they
take
everything
in
their
boxes
or
prejudices.
mr.
don
langston
of
course
we
don’t
--
we
think
that
the
standard
is
said
in
the
statute
and
we
don’t
see
how
you
could
draft
to
set
the
standards
that
would
tell
the
jury
what
to
do
in
each
particular
case,
i
think
the
legislature
to
adopt
standards
would
have
to
be
in
session
all
the
time
and
enact
almost
ex
post
facto
laws
to
cover
every
situation
and
that
is
what
are
our
argument
is
that
the
only
thing
that
you
could
--
we
don’t
think
whether
to
use
a
weapon
or
whatever
you
do
makes
any
difference.
we
think
that
the
evidence
before
the
jury
that
that
is
the
standard
that
they’re
going
to
go
by
is
the
evidence
that
is
presented
in
the
case.
there
are
no
further
questions,
that’s
our
case.
mr.
don
langston
he
wrote
in
1785
originally.
now,
of
course
weighing
indeed
go
about
it
was
a
simply
cut
back
more
and
more.
they
first
of
all
removed
the
death
penalty
for
stealing
from
bleaching
grounds
and
then
for
pickpocketing
and
then
for
taking
(inaudible)
and
what
have
you.
until
they
got
it
down
eventually
to
murder
and
then
in
1957
notwithstanding
the
real
commissions
recommendation
which
the
california
cites
in
its
brief
saying
it
was
very
difficult
to
get
down
any
narrower
as
a
matter
of
category
english
went
ahead
again.
in
1957,
and
delimited
capital
punishment
by
categories.
now,
the
only
other
thing
i
think
need
to
answer
--
mr.
don
langston
it
was
done
by
parliament.
mr.
don
langston
may
it
please
the
court.
as
the
eight
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
said
when
it
was
before
them
that
guilt
or
innocence
is
not
an
issue
in
this
case.
our
state's
supreme
court
has
held
in
this
case
that
the
evidence
made
an
overwhelming
fashion,
all
of
the
requirements
for
conviction,
for
the
offensive
rape,
as
it
was
defined
in
1962.
of
course,
our
rape
statute
has
been
changed,
since
that
time
in
1967,
it
was
changed
for
three
degrees
of
rape,
and
the
penalty
was
changed
for
first
degree
rape,
which
this
would
have
fit
into,
if
it
has
occurred
after
1967.
the
new
penalty
for
rape,
first-degree
rape
is
30
years
to
life
or
death,
in
the
discretion
of
the
jury,
which
this
offense
would
fall
into.
the
facts
of
this
particular
case
do
not
appear
to
be
an
issue
that
as
the
eight
circuit
characterized
it,
that
the
circumstances
of
this
crime,
as
usual
are
sorted.
a
few
of
the
background
facts
is
that
on
november
3,
1961,
in
the
early
morning
of
--
in
that
early
morning,
a
35-year-old
white
woman
was
brutally
beaten
and
raped
by
the
petitioner
in
this
case.
and
her
90-year-old
helpless
father
was
also
beaten.
she
was
then
dragged
to
the
vacant
lot
down
the
street
and
attacked.
we
feel
that
guilt
or
innocence
is
not
an
issue
in
this
case
as
are
other
issues,
which
mr.
amsterdam
has
mentioned
in
his
brief
and
his
oral
argument
here.
in
arkansas,
there
are
five
offenses,
which
are
punishable
by
death.
one
is
kidnapping,
also
rape,
murder
in
the
first
degree,
a
treason,
and
burning
of
prisons
by
convicts.
as
originally
enacted
in
arkansas,
these
statutes
provided
automatically
for
the
death
penalty.
in
1915,
the
arkansas
legislature,
as
mr.
amsterdam
has
mentioned,
enacted
arkansas
statute
43-2153,
which
gave
the
jury
the
discretion
of
imposing
a
sentence
of
life
imprisonment,
instead
of
death.
now,
petitioner
and
some
of
briefs
that
were
filed
on
his
behalf
about
others
contend
that
the
death
penalty
should
be
voided
and
abolished
as
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
while
the
state
of
arkansas
recognizes
that
there
may
be
some
movement
in
that
direction,
that
issue
is
not
before
this
court.
mr.
don
langston
unanimous.
mr.
don
langston
unanimous,
your
honor.
mr.
don
langston
all
verdicts
of
criminal
cases
have
to
be
unanimous.
in
civil
cases,
nine
can
bring
in
a
verdict.
or
what
it's
worth
to
this
court,
in
1967,
a
bill
was
introduced
in
the
arkansas
legislature
to
abolish
capital
punishment,
public
hearings
were
held,
and
the
issues
were
debated,
and
the
bill
got
no
word,
it
wasn't
fitted
overwhelmingly.
also,
senses
kick
--
mr.
don
langston
i
don't
remember,
your
honor.
also,
since
this
case
was
argued
last
year,
there
had
been
some
eight
death
verdicts
returned
in
arkansas,
at
least
six
of
them
were
white
people,
two
of
them
were
black
people.
mr.
don
langston
the
vote
on
the
bill,
your
honor?
mr.
don
langston
all
right.
also,
in
this
case
in
the
briefs,
also
in
the
argument
here
today
about
mr.
amsterdam,
they
want
to
inject
the
issue
of
discrimination
and
race
in
this
case.
petitioners
and
some
of
the
briefs
filed
in
his
behalf
vote
a
lot
of
their
argument
on
this
point.
we
can
only
state
that
discrimination
and
imposition
of
this
death
penalty
was
advanced
by
petitioner
in
his
petition
for
certiorari,
and
was
rejected
by
this
court.
it
was
rejected
by
the
district
court.
it
was
also
rejected
by
the
eighth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
what
this
case
actually
concerns,
itself
with
is
the
validity
of
procedural
means
used
in
imposing
the
death
penalty
on
a
criminal
defendant,
whether
he
be
white
or
black.
we
contend
that
this
case
in
effect
really
involves
issue
of
whether
the
jury
system
is
a
workable
procedure
in
capital
cases.
mr.
don
langston
no,
your
honor.
mr.
don
langston
excuse
me?
mr.
don
langston
i
know
of
no
case
where
that
has
ever
been
requested
your
honor.
i've
read
it
in
some
of
these
briefs,
where
in
some
of
these
statistical
studies
that
from
the
transcripts
and
the
case
that
you
could
not
tell
the
race
of
the
victim
or
the
race
of
the
defendant.
mr.
don
langston
i
mean
you
can't
tell
it
from
the
transcript,
whenever
they
were
given
the
statistics
for
the
district
court
trial.
yes
sir,
the
jury
can
tell.
mr.
don
langston
that's
correct
your
honor.
the
decision
of
the
district
court
on
standards
held
that
the
untied
states
constitution
did
not
make
it
necessary
that
trial
courts
in
arkansas
charge
or
instruct
juries
regarding
standards
or
guidelines
to
guide
them
in
assessing
life
or
death.
the
court
reasoned
that
arkansas
procedure,
rested
the
decision,
in
the
discretion
of
the
jury
to
be
exercised
in
the
light
of
judgment,
common
sense,
and
experience
of
the
jurors,
and
the
jurors
are
presumed
to
be
persons
of
good
judgment
and
common
sense.
we
advance
that
argument
here
today
also
on
the
single
verdict
procedure,
the
district
court
held
that
while
some
states
may
have
split
verdicts.
no
court
has
held
or
it
does
not
think
that
is
constitutionally
required
that
any
court
have
a
split
verdict.
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
went
along
the
same
line.
it
rejected
the
petitioner's
contentions
in
these
cases,
and
we
recommend
that
opinion
to
this
court
in
deciding
this
case.
mr.
don
langston
yes
sir,
its
defined
in
the
jury
instructions
and
--
mr.
don
langston
it
would
be
in
the
jury
instruction.
we
have
filed
the
transcript
of
the
original
case
with
this
court.
i
suppose
it
still
has
it.
and
the
court
defines
rape.
mr.
don
langston
i
believe
that
they
are
separate
your
honor.
mr.
don
langston
no,
i
don't
recall,
because
we've
changed
our
rape
statute.
mr.
don
langston
alright,
your
honor.
since
this
case
argued
before
this
court,
some
federal
and
state
courts
have
decided
that
these
two
issues
against
the
petitioner.
and
we
recommend
those
cases
to
the
court.
they
are
cited
on
pages
31
and
32
of
petitioner's
supplemental
brief
to
enlarge
the
issues.
mr.
don
langston
no,
your
honor,
it
cannot.
if
you
plead
guilty,
the
jury
has
to
be
impaneled
and
the
state
puts
on
a
prima
facie
case.
mr.
don
langston
of
guilt,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
don
langston
ordinarily,
the
trial
would
be
very
short
and
just
enough
--
ordinarily,
it
would
be
probably
the
fact
that
in
a
murder
case
that
a
murder
has
occurred,
and
that
the
defendant
has
confessed
to
it.
mr.
don
langston
i
think
those
factors
are
quite
an
effort
for
the
jury
to
make
an
intelligent
position
on
punishment.
mr.
don
langston
that's
our
position,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
don
langston
in
felonies,
only
in
cases
where
the
jury
cannot
agree,
then
he
can
set
the
punishment.
what
they
had
--
mr.
don
langston
no,
your
honor,
we
do
not.
mr.
don
langston
that's
correct.
what
happens
is
the
jury
goes
out
and
decides
guilt
and
then
it
reports
back
to
the
judge
that
it
has
decided
on
guilt
or
innocence,
but
cannot
reach
a
verdict
on
punishment.
then
the
judge
takes
the
case
--
he
takes
the
verdict
of
guilt,
then
he
sets
the
punishment
--
punishment
within
statutory
limits.
mr.
don
langston
what's
he's
heard
is
what
the
jury
has
heard.
mr.
don
langston
there
is
a
statute
in
arkansas
that
whenever
a
person
is
sentenced
to
the
penitentiary
that
there
will
be
--
the
judge
will
send
along
with
the
prisoner
his
remarks,
the
prosecuting
attorney
will
send
his
remarks
along
with
it.
it
sort
of
a
presentence
report,
but
--
mr.
don
langston
that
is
correct.
mr.
don
langston
there
might
--
could
be
some,
under
the
statute
that
we
have
cited
if
when
the
defendant
would
file
a
motion
for
a
new
trial,
which
is
the
overruling
of
this
motion
is
what
you
appeal
from
in
arkansas
is
from
a
motion,
from
the
denial
of
your
motion
for
new
trial.
he
may
--
if
the
judge
in
his
discretion
wants
to,
he
may
hear
some
evidence
in
allocution,
but
i
don't
think
it's
very
common
in
arkansas.
mr.
don
langston
that's
correct.
mr.
don
langston
no,
your
honor,
it
do
not.
mr.
don
langston
that's
correct.
mr.
don
langston
ordinarily,
they
--
mr.
don
langston
it's
an
unfettered
discretion.
ordinarily
the
judge
instructs
them
on
--
mr.
don
langston
i
doubt
it,
your
honor.
mr.
don
langston
i
didn't
get
your
last
word?
mr.
don
langston
well,
we
think
that
discretion
of
the
jury
is
a
good
thing.
mr.
don
langston
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
don
langston
your
honor,
in
the
early
morning
hours
on
november
3,
1961,
the
defendant,
the
white
woman,
35-year-old
white
woman,
living
with
her
invalid
90-year-old
father,
heard
someone
trying
to
break
in
to
their
house.
she
went
to
the
door
and
told
the
man
to
leave,
and
said
she
would
call
the
police.
he
had
a
stocking
he
was
trying
to
pull
down
over
his
head.
so,
he
wouldn't
--
he
kept
advancing
toward
her,
so
she
got
on
the
telephone,
and
got
the
operator,
who
when
the
man
attacked
the
woman,
she
started
screaming,
so
the
operator
connected
the
telephone
with
the
police,
and
the
police
heard
the
screams
over
the
telephone
and
they
were
struggling
there.
her
invalid
father
came
in
to
assist
her.
the
defendant
put
his
hand
over
her
mouth,
she
bit
his
finger,
and
bit
his
hand.
mr.
don
langston
bit
the
defendant's
finger
and
his
hand.
his
father
could
not
help
her,
so
he
went
to
the
window
and
started
yelling
for
help.
of
course,
the
police
were
trying
to
locate
where
the
telephone
call
is
coming
from.
so
the
defendant
then
dragged
the
victim
from
her
house,
down
the
street
to
up
of
embankment,
up
to
a
vacant
lot.
there
were
cuts
and
bruises
on
her
feet,
she
was
in
her
pajamas.
and
there
were
cuts
all
over
and
they
struggling
up
there
in
the
lot,
and
he
threatened
to
kill
her,
if
she
told,
and
that's
basically
the
facts.
mr.
don
langston
he
beat
the
father
too,
and
so
the
father
said,
“i
just
can't
help
you
anymore,”
and
so
went
to
the
window
and
tried
to
yell
for
help.
and
he
dragged
the
victim
out
from
the
house.
mr.
don
langston
just
his
fist.
mr.
don
langston
90.
90
years
old.
and
he
was
an
invalid.
mr.
don
langston
no,
sir.
mr.
don
langston
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
don
langston
that's
correct.
mr.
don
langston
that's
correct.
mr.
don
langston
no,
your
honor,
he
can't
do
that
in
capital
cases,
you
cannot
do
that.
mr.
don
langston
that's
correct.
mr.
don
langston
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
i
don't
know
of
any
--
i
do
not
know
of
any
case
that
would
hold
that.
mr.
don
langston
i
believe
your
correct.
mr.
don
langston
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
that
they
have
any
allocution
in
our
state
courts.
mr.
don
langston
that's
correct.
mr.
don
langston
i
wasn't
aware
of
it,
mr.
amsterdam
we
do,
but
i
wasn't
aware
of
the
allocation
statute.
mr.
don
langston
i
do
not
--
i
didn't
--
i
don't
know
of
the
statute
that
says.
mr.
don
langston
i
know
that
--
i've
tried
some
criminal
cases
and
it's
never
done.
mr.
don
langston
well,
whatever
he
sentence
--
whenever
he
sentences,
your
honor.
mr.
don
langston
your
honor,
he
brings
in
a
judgment,
if
the
judge
is
trying
it
himself,
trial
before
the
court,
he
brings
in
the
judgment.
of
course,
and
he
waits
the
statutory,
the
limit
of
time
before
he
sentences
him,
then
he
does
asked
him
he
has
anything
to
say
in
his
behalf
or
nearly
nothing
he's
saying.
mr.
don
langston
yes,
yes
sir.
mr.
don
langston
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
mr.
don
langston
yes,
sir.
mr.
don
langston
48
hours.
mr.
don
langston
of
course,
this
can
--
mr.
don
langston
by
statute
in
arkansas,
you
have
to
wait
48
hours
before
you
can
sentence
a
person
--
mr.
don
langston
the
jury
fixes
the
sentence,
i
mean
the
jury
fixes
the
punishment,
the
judgment
is
in
and
on
that
verdict
and
then
--
mr.
don
langston
no,
your
honor.
mr.
don
langston
yes,
sir.
mr.
don
langston
no,
they
always
asked
them.
the
judge
always
asked,
whenever
he
sentences
in
any
trial,
he
ask
if
he
has
anything
to
say
before
sentence
is
passed.
mr.
don
langston
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
don
langston
there
are
several,
newly
discovered
evidence,
any
errors
occurred
during
trial.
mr.
don
langston
and
put
on
evidence.
mr.
don
langston
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
don
langston
of
course,
he
could
set
the
verdict
decide
if
he
desires.
mr.
don
langston
your
honor,
i
just
know
that
that's
done.
i
don't
know
that
it
has
any
effect
at
all
or
(voice
overlap).
mr.
don
langston
i
suppose
that
anything
he
said
that
would
be
relevant
to
his
sentence
could
be
said.
mr.
don
langston
the
43-2310
says,
that
if
the
judge,
in
cases
of
conviction,
doesn't
think
that
the
punishment
sentence
is
correct,
he
has
the
power
to
reduce
the
extent
or
duration
of
the
sentence.
mr.
don
langston
in
effect,
in
arkansas
the
jury
it
does.
mr.
don
langston
as
far
as
i
know
what's
never
been
interpreted
--
mr.
don
langston
yes,
sir.
mr.
don
langston
your
honor,
it's
never
been
interpreted
by
our
supreme
court
--
mr.
don
langston
i
haven't
found
any
cases
on
it,
but
i
have
been
told
by
some
judges
that
it
has
been
done.
mr.
don
langston
yes,
sir.
mr.
don
langston
that's
correct.
your
honor.
mr.
don
langston
i
believe
he
could,
your
honor.
mr.
don
langston
i
am
advised
that
it
has
been
done
but
the
case
didn't
go
to
the
supreme
court,
maybe
there
was
something
in
the
trial
that
the
judge
was
--
i
don't
know
what
it
could
have
occurred
during
the
trial,
but
the
judge
thought
on
motion
of
the
defendant
that
he
should
reduce
it
from
death
down
to
life,
and
that
it
has
been
done.
mr.
don
langston
no,
your
honor.
mr.
don
langston
i
don't
recall
whether
he
did
or
not.
mr.
don
langston
that's
what
the
statute
it
appears
to
say,
your
honor,
43-2310.
mr.
don
langston
the
court
shall
have
power
in
all
cases
of
conviction
to
reduce
the
extent
or
duration
of
the
punishment
assessed
by
the
jury.
if
in
the
opinion
of
the
court,
the
conviction
is
proper,
and
the
punishment
assessed
is
greater
than
under
the
circumstances
of
the
case,
ought
to
be
inflicted,
so
that
the
punishment
be
not,
in
any
case,
reduced
below
the
limit
prescribed
by
law
in
such
cases.
mr.
don
langston
that's
what
i
argued
the
last
time
we
were
up
here,
but
there's
been
no
interpretation
by
our
supreme
court
of
this
statute.
and
it
would
appear
on
its
face,
to
allow
him
to
reduce
the
verdict
--
mr.
don
langston
i
don't
know
of
any
one,
your
honor.
i
don't
know
of
any
supreme,
arkansas
supreme
court
cases
on
it.
and
the
only
way
you
could
do
it
was
probably
to
survey
the
--
make
a
survey
of
the
circuit
judges
in
arkansas,
and
see
if
they
have
ever
done
it,
the
current
ones.
mr.
don
langston
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
don
langston
i
think
he
could,
your
honor.
mr.
don
langston
i
would
think
if
he
were
only
dissatisfied
with
the
sentence,
he
would
just
modify
it
and
not
have
a
complete
trial.
mr.
don
langston
i
would
believe
so,
your
honor.
mr.
don
langston
that's
my
interpretation
of
the
statute.
mr.
don
langston
no,
your
honor.
mr.
don
langston
that's
correct.
mr.
don
langston
i
suppose,
it's
been
in
the
revised
statutes,
chapter
45,
so
it's
--
it
is
as
old
as
the
--
i
imagine
it
was
back
whenever
the
arkansas
came
into
the
union.
mr.
don
langston
that's
correct.
mr.
don
langston
it's
never
been
interpreted
by
the
supreme
court.
i
have
been
advised
that
a
case
--
that
the
circuit
judge
has
reduced
them,
one
from
death
to
life.
mr.
don
langston
that's
all
i
know
of,
your
honor.
mr.
don
langston
i
don't
--
mr.
don
langston
not
that
i
know
of,
our
supreme
court
has
held
in
its
decision,
if
it
does
not
give
advisory
opinions,
only
when
there's
a
case
or
controversy.
mr.
don
langston
yes
sir,
your
honor.
mr.
don
langston
i
think
he
can,
your
honor.
mr.
don
langston
i
know
he
can,
yes
sir.
the
supreme
court
of
arkansas
as
the
petitioner's
cited
in
his
brief
says
that
the
supreme
court
of
arkansas
can
set
aside
a
death
verdict
whenever
there's
not
enough
evidence
to
support
it.
but
just
ordinarily,
they
can't
do
like
--
the
statute
here
says,
they
have
said
that
they
themselves
do
not
have
the
power,
unless
the
evidence
is
not
enough
to
support
the
change
--
mr.
don
langston
that's
correct.
mr.
don
langston
those
cases
--
mr.
don
langston
yes,
sir.
mr.
don
langston
that's
correct.
mr.
don
langston
no,
your
honor.
mr.
don
langston
the
court
enters
judgment
upon
the
verdict
of
the
jury,
which
is
entered.
mr.
justice
white
asked
mr.
amsterdam,
concerning
other
felonies
or
other
criminals
conduct
in
arkansas
standards.
we
believe
that
in
this
particular
case,
that
to
accept
their
argument,
that
standards
must
be
applied
in
capital
punishment
or
life
imprisonment
cases
that
are
set
for
the
jury
that
the
court
would
have
no
alternative,
but
to
order
standards
in,
say
cases
of
larceny
or
burglary,
and
arkansas
burglary
is
2
to
21
years,
larceny
is
1
to
21
years.
we
can
see
if
the
court
accepts
it
here
that
they
could
perhaps
--
they
would
perhaps
--
the
next
step
would
be
to
put
in
those
types
of
cases.
and
we
would
--
in
arkansas,
of
course,
we
would
almost
have
to
try
every
one
of
our
cases
over
again.
mr.
don
langston
yes,
sir.
mr.
don
langston
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
don
langston
that's
correct.
mr.
don
langston
yes,
sir.
mr.
don
langston
that's
correct.
only
single
verdict
procedure,
the
way
i
gathered
from
the
petitioner's
argument,
he
is
saying
that
either
one
he
would
have
a
separate
penalty
trial
with
the
same
jury
or
two,
he
would
have
a
separate
jury
for
penalty,
or
three,
that
he
would
have
the
judge
set
the
penalty
after
a
hearing
on
allocution.
we
submit
that
this
court
has
never
held
that
any
states
should
have
to
have
a
double
jury,
have
a
double
hearing
on
this
particular
aspect
or
case.
mr.
don
langston
that's
correct.
mr.
don
langston
he
is
treated
as
any
other
witness
would
be,
your
honor.
mr.
don
langston
he
can
be
asked
about
the
prior
acts
of
misconduct,
felony
convictions,
and
things
of
that
nature.
mr.
don
langston
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
don
langston
yes.
mr.
don
langston
the
judge
gives
a
cautionary
instruction
that
is
only
to
go
to
test
his
credibility
as
a
witness.
mr.
don
langston
that's
my
understanding
of
the
law,
your
honor.
mr.
don
langston
if
the
defendant
answers
in
the
negative,
that
ends
the
matter
though,
your
honor.
he
can't
come
back
and
introduce
independent
evidence
that
he
did,
do
these
acts.
he
must
take
his
answer.
mr.
don
langston
that's
correct,
he
must
take
his
answer,
he
cannot
come
back
and
introduce,
he
can
ask
him
if
he's
been
convicted
of
a
felony,
excuse
me,
has
been
guilty
of
acts
of
misconduct,
if
he
denies,
and
said
he
did
not,
and
he
can't
bring
in
a
witness
and
say,
“yes,
he
did
do
it.”
mr.
don
langston
these
--
the
cases
in
arkansas
sort
of
go
more
to
acts
of
misconduct,
toward
moral
turpitude
than
anything
else.
like
indecent
conduct
or
things
of
