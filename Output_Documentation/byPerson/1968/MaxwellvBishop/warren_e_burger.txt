chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
per
argument
in
maxwell
against
bishop.
mr.
amsterdam
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
amsterdam,
would
it
be
fair
to
say
that
your
burden
here
is
not
to
persuade
us
that
the
bifurcated
trial
or
split
verdict,
and
the
standards
to
guide
the
jury
are
a
wise
and
a
sound
thing,
but
that
the
constitution
requires
that
they
be
provided,
the
narrow
issue,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
amsterdam,
it's
only
about
10
years
ago
that
congress,
as
the
legislative
body
for
the
district
of
columbia
abolished
mandatory
capital
punishment
and
created
a
mechanism,
somewhat
like
the
one
you've
described,
the
more
flexible
one,
is
that
not
true?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
for
purposes
of
this
argument,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
or
does
it
in
your
view,
what
the
crime
is,
but
only
what
the
punishment
is?
isn't
that
true?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
any
different
from
the
function
of
the
jury,
the
traditional
function
of
a
jury,
which
passes
on
the
damages
in
an
automobile
accident
case
or
breach
of
contract
that
they
never
before
and
never
again
will
deal
with
that
kind
of
a
problem?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i'm
talking
about
their
function.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
obviously,
the
difference
doesn't
lie.
in
terms
of
the
function,
is
it
any
different?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
these
questions,
in
exchanges
mr.
amsterdam
suggest
that
legislative
bodies
have
considerable
advantage
over
this
court,
for
example
in
terms
of
flushing
out
all
the
facts,
getting
all
the
information,
finding
out
precisely
what
is
done,
and
what
the
experiments,
and
innovations
have
led
to?
as
for
example
it
was
done
10
years
ago
when
the
congress
conducted
extensive
hearings
and
amended,
abandoned
this
mandatory
capital
punishment.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
if
we
start
with
your
conclusion,
which
you
seem
to
pose
as
a
premise,
we
start
with
your
conclusion
that
there
must
be
standards,
mr.
amsterdam,
then
while
you're
not
quite
home
free
or
lonely
down
the
road,
isn't
there
a
very,
very
large
question
of
judgment,
whether
any
standards
at
all
are
feasible?
isn't
that
a
large
question,
however
it's
answered?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
you
enlarge
your
question?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
because
it's
in
this
court
to
make
that
judgment,
when
we
have
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you're
asking
us
to
make
the
judgment,
that
standards
are
imperatively
required
under
the
constitution.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i'm
doing
--
both
are
involved,
but
if
you
say
to
us,
as
you
are,
if
understand
you
that
we
must
mandate
that
the
constitution
requires
some
standards,
but
leaving
it
to
someone
else
to
decide
what
those
standards
would
be.
isn't
that
quite
a
large
blank
check,
constitutional
blank
check?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
do
you
have
any
(voice
overlap)
doubt
whatever
that
if
followed
your
recourse,
and
the
legislatures
of
the
several
states
undertook
to
carry
that
out,
that
the
first
time
a
death
penalty
was
invoked
to
someone
would
be
up
here
saying
those
standards
are
not
adequate.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
i'll
let
you
ponder
on
that
while
turning
in
your
lunch
hour,
mr.
amsterdam.
[lunch
recess]
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
amsterdam,
you
had
the
chance
to
ponder
on
justice
harlan's
question,
if
you
want
to
address
yourself
to
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
amsterdam,
i
was
just
coming
to
that,
you're
practically
out
of
time.
we'll
enlarge
your
time
10
minutes
and
we'd
enlarge
with
your
friend's
time
at
same
degree.
and
perhaps
you'd
better
address
yourself
to
that
point
now.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
you
don't
get
any
questions,
you
can
assume
that
it
can
be
submitted
on
the
brief.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
i
was
just
coming
to
that
on
another
form
of
justice
harlan's
question,
namely:
would
it
solve
your
purposes,
would
it
meet
your
problems,
if
the
defendant
could
either
under
oath
or
not
under
oath
be
permitted
to
address
himself,
by
his
own
testimony,
by
his
own
statements
to
the
question
of
litigation,
and
then
apply
the
familiar
rule
that
cross-examination
would
be
limited
to
the
scope
of
the
direct
testimony?
in
the
single
trial,
now
this
gets
out
i
think
out,
perhaps
what
just
justice
harlan
was
probing
out,
in
terms
of
a
right
to
speak
to
the
jury.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
it
should
not
be
an
issue?0
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you.
mr.
attorney
general.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you're
point,
i
take
it
as
merely
that
the
measurement
of
this
is
therefore
becomes
a
very
difficult
--
because
you
don't
label
the
record,
one
way
or
the
other.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
about
the
attack
on
the
father?
you
referred
that
before,
that
he
was
beaten.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
it
applies
only
to
cases
where
the
sentence
is
fix
by
the
judge,
is
that
what
you're
telling
us?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
even
when
the
judge
sentences?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
aren't
you
familiar
enough
for
the
day-to-day
practice,
so
that
you
can
say
you
--
that
you
know
the
right
is
not
accorded
to
a
defendant,
when
the
judge
is
sentencing?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
it
is
regularly
done?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
what
is
--
is
there
a
time
lag
that
the
judgments
wait
before
he
sentences?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
48
hours.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
that
answer
came
in
response
to
my
question,
mr.
justice
brennan,
relating
to
non-jury
penalty.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
he
can't
do
it
a
capital
case?
in
a
capital
case,
he
can't
do
it,
that
i
understood
you
to
say?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
read
that
to
us,
so
we
can
get
it
before
us.
do
you
mind
mr.
justice
brennan?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
isn't
under
the
arkansas
statute,
isn't
this
sentence
part
of
the
judgment,
when
the
jury
has
made
a
combined
verdict
of
guilty
and
fix
the
penalty?
you
don't
have
two
documents
for
the
judgment,
do
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
just
one
judgment
which
is
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
harris.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then,
you
get
a
new
jury?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
when
it
goes
back,
you
have
a
different
jury?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose,
for
this
absolute
unreviewable
discretion
of
the
trial
judge
to
reduce
from
death
to
a
life
sentence,
this
mean
of
course,
that
if
there
are
some
judges
who
have
conscientious
objections,
and
scruples
about
the
death
penalty,
they
would
set
aside
death
penalties
more
readily
and
no
one
could
review
that,
is
that
correct?
no
one
can
question
the
judge
about
his
decisions.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
i
could
some
of
mr.
amsterdam's
arguments
that
bartered
on
unequal
protection
to
now
with
equal
protection
might
reach
your
situation
too,
for
such
similar
case
here
today,
so
i
won't
burden
you
with
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that's
a
shaping
of
standards
in
a
way,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
the
stays
have
been
applicable
in
great
many
other
states
too,
have
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
general
harris.
mr.
amsterdam,
you
have
just
a
few
minutes
left.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
amsterdam,
the
figures
of
course,
the
statistics
cited
in
this
case,
i'm
sure
you
would
agree
aren't
very
firm
or
clear,
or
hard
in
any
direction,
but
just
on
the
surface,
these
figures
of
the
number
of
people
in
california
now
in
death
row
do
not
argue
persuasively
that
the
bifurcated
trial
has
been
of
any
great
assistance
in
avoiding
death
penalties,
would
you
say?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
you've
made
the
point
i
was
trying
to
make,
but
none
of
these
figures
are
really
very
reliable
to
demonstrate
anything
or
very
reliable
in
terms
of
drawing
inference
from
them.
on
the
surface,
some
people
would
draw
some
very
firm
inferences
from
the
california
situation.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
they're
subject
to
an
explanation.
and
then
that
may
be
true
as
to
all
these
figures
that
we
have
been
given
in
the
brief
amicus
and
elsewhere.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
have
these
--
any
of
these
studies
been
subjected
to
an
adversary
type
process
with
cross-examination
as
to
the
basis
and
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
amsterdam
for
submission.
thank
you
gentlemen
for
yours.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
per
argument
in
maxwell
against
bishop.
mr.
amsterdam
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief

warren
e.

mr.

this
sentence
part
of
the
judgment,
when
the
jury
has
made
a
combined
verdict
of
guilty
and
fix
the
penalty?
you
don't
have
two
documents
for
the
judgment,
do
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
just
one
judgment
which
is
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
harris.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then,
you
get
a
new
jury?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
when
it
goes
back,
you
have
a
different
jury?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose,
for
this
absolute
unreviewable
discretion
of
the
trial
judge
to
reduce
from
death
to
a
life
sentence,
this
mean
of
course,
that
if
there
are
some
judges
who
have
conscientious
objections,
and
scruples
about
the
death
penalty,
they
would
set
aside
death
penalties
more
readily
and
no
one
could
review
that,
is
that
correct?
no
one
can
question
the
judge
about
his
decisions.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
i
could
some
of
mr.
amsterdam's
arguments
that
bartered
on
unequal
protection
to
now
with
equal
protection
might
reach
your
situation
too,
for
such
similar
case
here
today,
so
i
won't
burden
you
with
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that's
a
shaping
of
standards
in
a
way,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
the
stays
have
been
applicable
in
great
many
other
states
too,
have
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
general
harris.
mr.
amsterdam,
you
have
just
a
few
minutes
left.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
amsterdam,
the
figures
of
course,
the
statistics
cited
in
this
case,
i'm
sure
you
would
agree
aren't
very
firm
or
clear,
or
hard
in
any
direction,
but
just
on
the
surface,
these
figures
of
the
number
of
people
in
california
now
in
death
row
do
not
argue
persuasively
that
the
bifurcated
trial
has
been
of
any
great
assistance
in
avoiding
death
penalties,
would
you
say?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
you've
made
the
point
i
was
trying
to
make,
but
none
of
these
figures
are
really
very
reliable
to
demonstrate
anything
or
very
reliable
in
terms
of
drawing
inference
from
them.
on
the
surface,
some
people
would
draw
some
very
firm
inferences
from
the
california
situation.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
they're
subject
to
an
explanation.
and
then
that
may
be
true
as
to
all
these
figures
that
we
have
been
given
in
the
brief
amicus
and
elsewhere.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
have
these
--
any
of
these
studies
been
subjected
to
an
adversary
type
process
with
cross-examination
as
to
the
basis
and
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
amsterdam
for
submission.
thank
you
gentlemen
for
yours.
the
case
is
submitted.
