justice
john
m.
harlan
what's
your
last
question
there
once
again?
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
fourth
question?
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
texas
statute
is
the
one
we
noticed
briefly
perhaps
in
spencer?
justice
john
m.
harlan
this
may
be
tangential,
how
many
states
have
still
got
capital
punishment?
justice
john
m.
harlan
how
many
states
still
have
capital
punishment?
justice
john
m.
harlan
when
did
the
--
when
did
arkansas
take
the
death
--
put
the
death
penalty
in
the
hands
of
the
jury?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
said
that
the
history
of
this
transition
from
the
mandatory
death
sentence
to
jury
fixing
the
death
sentence
is
the
product,
the
way
i
understood
it
is
quiet
to
the
mandatory
death
sentences
without
regard
to
the
question
of
whether
it
was
in
the
element
the
of
compassion
entering
into
it.
is
that
born
out
by
the
history
of
this
change
over?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
that's
would
i
--
that's
what
i
gathered.
there
is
no
documentation
that
you
can
bring
the
bare
bones.
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
put
a
hypothetical
to
you
preliminary
to
lunch
now,
it's
prompted
by
the
colloquy
between
you
and
the
chief
justice.
supposing
a
legislature
said
that
the
jury
is
to
fix
the
death
penalty
based
only
upon
the
record
and
only
upon
the
evidence
that's
introduced,
it's
relevant
to
guilt;
would
you
regard
that
as
a
standard?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
that
opens
up
the
question
that
chief
justice
says,
i
would
assume
that
your
answer
will
be
there
--
was
a
standard,
but
it's
not
good
enough,
and
that
plunges
the
court,
doesn't
it,
into
the
chief
justice's
suggested?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
would
you
say
if
the
death
penalty
is
put
in
solely
in
the
hands
and
the
sole
discretion
of
the
judge,
would
you
say
it's
standing
from
necessary
thereto?
justice
john
m.
harlan
have
you
considered
this
question
of
a
bifurcated
trials,
as
you
all
been
longing
in
this
point
of
it
might
be
easily
be
called
a
right
of
allocution
whether
in
the
technical
sense
of
that
term
or
whether
in
the
sense
of
as
it's
developed
in
some
states
at
least,
a
right
to
put
in
evidence
and
litigations
not
relevant
to
the
issue
of
guilt?
i
didn't
see
anything
in
your
brief
that
touch
that.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
arkansas
has
that
an
allocution,
generalized
allocution
statute.
how
does
it
operate
in
these
capital
cases,
where
the
jury,
not
the
judge
fixes
the
penalty?
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
they
have
any
at
all?
justice
john
m.
harlan
let
me
ask
you
one
question,
before
you
leave
this
phase
of
argument.
does
arkansas
permit
the
state
itself
as
distinguished
as
a
defendant
to
introduce
in
this
case
and
achieve
the
evidence
as
relevant
to
sentencing
but
would
not
be
admissible
on
the
issue
of
guilt.
justice
john
m.
harlan
it
does
not
prevent
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
does
it
have
to
be
a
unanimous
verdict
of
the
jury
or
is
it
something
less
unanimous?
justice
john
m.
harlan
between
a
life
or
death.
justice
john
m.
harlan
unanimous.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
was
the
rule?
was
he
sure
of
both?
justice
john
m.
harlan
if
you
can
get
those
statistics,
would
you
mind
getting
them?
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
wherein
a
charge
is
asked
in
this
case,
on
that
question?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
not
race?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
does
that
judges
do
down
there?
as
someone
says,
you
should
not
consider
the
race
of
the
person,
of
the
witness,
of
the
person's
race.
is
any
history
of
what
the
judge
charges
the
jury,
have
requested
in
that
field?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
they
know
it,
don't
they
--
i
would
suppose.
justice
john
m.
harlan
may
i
ask
you
of
the
definition,
statutory
definition
of
rape?
is
in
your
record
somewhere,
in
arkansas?
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
where
is
it
in
this
record,
do
you
know?
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
that
in
the
same
--
is
that
definition
of
rape
in
the
same
statute
that
fixes
the
punishment
for
rape?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
don't
know.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
could
you
mind
letting
us
know?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
presume
that
there
were
facts
in
this
case,
from
which
the
jury
can
discern
itself
about
it,
was
there
none?
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
what
were
those
facts
that
cause
the
jury,
it
must
have
been
something
that
do
with
the
jury
sentencing
to
death.
how
did
this
crime
occur?
justice
john
m.
harlan
bit
whose
finger?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
how
did
he
beat
the
father
in
what
way?
justice
john
m.
harlan
how
old
was
her
father?
justice
john
m.
harlan
have
you
read
the
statute
to
which
you
refer
us
now?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
does
he
have
a
mo
--
does
he
have
a
right
to
make
a
motion,
a
new
trial?
justice
john
m.
harlan
on
what
ground?
justice
john
m.
harlan
they
have
a
right
to
make
a
motion
for
new
trial
and
now
they
get
before
the
jury?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
argued
that
it
was
wrong
thing
and
erroneous
to
convict
him
or
sentence
at
all?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
a
sentence
without
a
judgment
wouldn't
be
worthless,
would
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
there
anything
like
that
been
asked
in
this
case?
not
the
vietnam
war?
justice
john
m.
harlan
did
the
state
trying
to
bring
anything
like
that
in
at
all?
justice
john
m.
harlan
has
there
been
any
change
in
california
law
since
the
henderson
opinion?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
mean
that
decision
hasn't
been
qualified
or
modified
or--?
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
you
knew
in
california
has
some
kind
of
standing
also,
maybe
not
enough
if
i
understand?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
its
absolute
discretion
of
those
imposing
words?
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
that
a
standard?
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
may
there
also
be
a
waiver
just
on
the
guilt
--
plea
of
guilty
to
the
crime,
but
then
a
jury
trial
on
penalty?
justice
john
m.
harlan
does
your
adult
authority
play
any
part
of
death
sentencing
position?
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
there
any
debate
going
on
in
california
now
as
to
the
abolition
of
the
death
sentence?
justice
john
m.
harlan
nothing
or
anything.[laughter]
justice
john
m.
harlan
excuse
me.
justice
john
m.
harlan
finish
what
you're
going
to
say,
because
i
want
you
to
ask
you
a
question.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
take
it,
but
there's
no
appellate
review
of
sentencing
in
arkansas.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what's
your
