mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i’m
here
on
behalf
of
the
state
of
california
as
amicus
curiae,
in
behalf
of
the
respondent,
and
with
the
permission
of
the
attorney
general
of
arkansas
speaking
here
particularly
and
exclusively
with
respect
to
the
first
question
that
is
presented
in
this
case.
california
and
arkansas
in
this
matter
of
sentencing
procedures
in
capital
cases
share
really
only
one
common
element
and
that
is
the
element
of
living
it
to
the
jury
to
determine
whether
or
not
life
sentence
should
be
imposed
instead
of
a
death
sentence
without
any
standards,
without
any
restrictions
without
as
we
put
it
in
our
instruction,
in
your
absolute
and
sole
discretion.
that’s
the
common
element
we
share
and
that’s
why
we’re
here
and
that’s
why
we’re
concerned
about
this
case.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
yes,
we
do
your
honor.
we
have
a
so-called
bifurcated
trial
where
the
--
at
the
outset
that
jury
returns
the
verdict
on
guilt
and
on
guilt
alone,
and
then
usually
a
couple
of
weeks
later,
they
start
a
penalty
hearing.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
normally
it’s
the
same
jury.
the
trial
judge
has
the
authority
to
convene
a
new
jury
upon
good
cause
shown.
but
normally,
it
is
the
same
jury.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
yes,
it
is.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
no,
it
has
to
be
done
in
two
stages
in
every
case.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
it’s
been
the
law
as
long
as
i
can
even
concern
about
it.
i
guess
since
--
it
must
be
a
good
15
years,
maybe
longer
than
that.
i
really
don’t
know.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
pardon
me,
your
honor?
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
we
had
a
unitary
trial
as
they
do
in
arkansas
and
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
in
california?
at
the
present
time.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
yes,
we
do.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
very,
very
little
jury
sentencing.
it
wasn’t
a
great
a
while.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
but
very
little.
the
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
that’s
one
of
the
reasons
that
we’re
here
your
honor.
this
issue
was
very
thoroughly
got
into
before
the
california
supreme
courts
last
year
and
this
particular
attack
on
the
question
of
lack
of
standards
was
raised
and
resolved
by
the
california
supreme
court
in
favor
of
the
established
practice.
so
we
submit
that
it
is
valid
and
unconstitutional
for
a
jury
to
not
to
be
restricted
in
determining
whether
the
return
of
life
sentence
instead
of
a
death
sentence.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
that’s
right.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
that’s
correct.
well,
basically
the,
it
seems
to
me
the
same
rule
is
followed
in
arkansas
as
far
as
the
lack
of
any
standards
or
any
restrictions
on
the
jury
is
concerned
is
precisely
the
same
rule
that
this
court
required
in
the
winston
case
some
70
years
ago.
when
you
held
that
it
was
improper
for
a
trial
judge
to
give
a
standard
to
the
jury
and
to
say
to
them
you
should
return
a
death
sentence
unless
you
find
mitigating
circumstances
in
this
case.
now
you
held
that
was
not
correct
that
the
trial
judge
should
leave
it
to
the
jury
in
their
absolute
discretion
and
not
tilt
the
scale
one
way
or
the
other.
now
that
is
precisely
the
case
in
california.
and
the
jury
has
told
that
in
no
uncertain
terms
and
it’s
my
understanding
that
that
is
the
case
in
arkansas.
but
i
want
to
make
it
clear
that
on
this
question
of
the
unitary
trial,
we
do
not
express
any
view
because
we,
in
this
guilt
proceeding,
meet
the
objections
that
are
raised
in
terms
of
information
being
made
available
to
the
jury.
both
sides
are
free
to
put
in
evidence
in
mitigation
or
evidence
in
aggravation.
they’re
both
free
to
go
into
the
background
of
the
defendant
and
to
go
into
anything
that
is
relevant.
of
course
it
has
to
be
competent
evidence.
and
it
is
very
common
to
call
psychiatrist.
the
defendant
may
call
a
psychiatrist
who
says
he’s
examined
the
defendant
and
is
familiar
with
criminal
characters
and
is
in
his
judgment
this
man
can
be
rehabilitated.
now,
there’s
all
sorts
of
evidence
and
certainly
all
of
the
things
that
would
go
into
judge
sentencing
on
the
basis
of
a
probation
report
or
a
diagnostic
reports
in
our
non-capital
cases.
so,
i
think
as
far
as
that
objection
is
raised
and
of
course
it’s
tied
into
the
lack
of
standards,
we
meet
that
very
well
in
california.
now,
i’m
not
so
sure
it’s
a
benefit
to
the
defendant.
certainly,
the
bifurcated
trials
enacted
as
a
means
of
giving
a
jury
the
fullest
information
before
past
sentence.
and
i
think
that’s
a
good
idea.
to
say
with
the
benefits,
the
defendant
is
something
else
again
because
the
defendant
is
stuck
with
his
own
record.
he
made
his
life
and
if
it
hasn’t
been
a
good
one
he’ll
suffer
for
it
in
the
penalty
trial.
there’s
no
question
about
it.
and
it
can
be
very
difficult
for
the
defendant
whether
or
not
in
the
long
run
it’s
better
to
bifurcate
or
whether
it’s
better
and
gives
the
defendant
a
better
shot
at
it
to
let
it
all
go
in
one
trial,
limit
the
jury
to
what’s
admissible
on
the
murder
charge
or
rape
charge
or
whatever
is
quite
another
question.
in
any
event,
we
recede
on
the
bifurcated
trial.
we
also
have
some
previsions
for
review
which
have
been
mentioned
in
the
briefs
particularly
filed
by
the
petitioner
who
argues
that
the
arkansas
jury
verdict
is
under
review.
unreviewable
for
all
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
at
the
end
of
the
penalty
jury
trial,
the
jury
is
instructed
in
a
standard
instruction
that
it
is
the
duty
of
the
jury
to
determine
which
of
the
penalty
is
either
death
sentence
or
life
imprisonment
should
we
impose.
i
won’t
read
the
whole
thing
but
just
basically,
you
should
consider
all
of
the
evidence
received
here
in
court
presented
by
the
people
and
defendants
throughout
the
trial
before
this
jury.
and
that
would
normally
include
all
the
evidence
on
the
guilt
face
as
well.
you
may
consider,
may
also
consider
all
of
the
evidence
of
the
circumstances
surrounding
a
crime
of
the
defendant’s
background
and
history.
and
of
the
facts
in
aggravation
or
mitigation
of
the
penalty
which
has
been
received
here
in
court.
however,
it
is
not
essential
to
your
decision
that
you
find
mitigating
circumstances
on
the
one
hand
or
evidence
in
aggravation
of
the
offense
on
the
other.
it’s
the
law
of
the
state
that
every
person
guilty
of
murder
in
the
first
degree
shall
suffer
death
or
confinement
in
the
state
prison
for
life
at
the
discretion
of
the
jury.
and
then
they’re
told
they
have
to
indicate
in
their
verdict
which
of
the
two
either
death
as
its
put
here
or
life
they
prefer.
and
then
they’re
told
there’s
notwithstanding
facts
if
any
proved
in
mitigation
or
aggravation.
in
determining
which
punishment
shall
be
inflicted,
you
are
entirely
free
to
act
according
to
your
own
judgment,
conscience,
and
absolute
discretion.
that
verdict
must
express
the
individual
opinion
of
each
juror.
beyond
prescribing
the
two
alternative
penalties,
the
law
itself
provides
no
standard
for
the
guidance
of
the
jury
and
the
selection
of
the
penalty
but
rather
commits
the
whole
matter
of
determining
which
of
the
two
penalties
shall
be
fixed
to
the
judgment,
conscience,
and
absolute
discretion
of
the
jury.
and
the
determination
of
that
matter
if
the
jury
does
agree,
it
must
be
anonymous
as
to
which
of
the
two
penalties
is
imposed.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
i
don’t
--it
certainly
not
set
forth
in
full
your
honor.
it
may
be
referred
to.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
i’d
be
very
happy
to
do
them.
there
are
some
other
instructions
that
come
in
for
example
at
california
supreme
court
had
a
great
problem
over
the
last
few
years
about
arguments
that
while
this
man
if
he
give
him
a
life
sentence
might
be
paroled
after
seven
years
and
go
back
and
commit
another
crime
and
we
have
a
special
instruction
now
that
covers
that
face,
what
a
life
sentence
means.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
pardon
me?
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
that’s
--
see,
it's
quite
a
long
one
your
honor
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
what
it
is
basically
is
that
the
jury
is
told
that
a
life
sentence
means
that
he
may
be
paroled
at
some
time.
but
that
it’s
up
to
the
adult
authority
to
determine
that’s
a
separate
agency
in
california
to
determine
when
if
ever
he
is
released
and
in
general,
you’re
not
suppose
to
be
concerned
about
that
anyhow.
they’ll
do
their
job.
properly,
you
do
your
job
properly.
that’s
the
gist
of
it.
that
he
can
be
paroled
but
they
shouldn’t
enter
into
your
considerations
as
yours.
i
--
we
submit
that
the
california
procedure
and
i
think
it’s
basically
the
same
on
its
element
of
lack
of
standards
was
adopted
originally
to
benefit
the
defendant
--
defendants
in
capital
cases
and
its
easier
to
say
that
the
legislature
passed
the
buck
that
it
didn’t
want
to
decide
the
hard
question
of
who
should
be
executed
and
who
shouldn’t
be.
but
i
don’t
think
that
was
the
basis
for
it.
i
think
the
basis
for
it
was
in
the
experience
of
all
of
us
who
know
anything
about
capital
cases
that
is
impossible,
at
least
i
think
its
impossible
to
set
out
in
advance
those
considerations
exclusively.
new
cases
come
along.
new
situations
developed.
some
of
the
considerations
are
those
referred
to
human
qualities
and
emotions
that
we
can’t
reduced
to
a
formula.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well
i
certainly
didn’t
mean
your
honor
to
convey
the
impression
that
the
two
systems
are
the
same
or
that
if
one
falls,
the
other
must
inevitably
fall
but
we,
and
we
do
not
identify
our
system
with
arkansas.
in
fact,
i
have
attempted
to
point
out
here
some
of
the
differentiating
factors.
but
in
--
when
you
go
pin
it
right
down
to
the
question
of
lack
of
standards
and
isolate
that
i
think
we
are
in
the
same
footing.
now,
it
may
be
that
there
are
other
aspects
of
the
procedure
which
would
say
that
even
if
the
court
felt
there
was
some
defect
in
the
arkansas
procedure.
we
certainly
hope
to
the
court
would
recognize
the
national
impact
of
its
rulings
and
that’s
one
of
the
reasons
that
we
wanted
to
present
our
position
here
and
that
our
state
supreme
court
has
just
resolve
these
questions
squarely
and
upheld
the
absence
of
the
standards.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
it
was
four
to
three,
your
honor.
there
is
one
other
face
of
the
differentiation
in
our
system.
your
honor,
after
the
jury
comes
to
its
verdict
the
trial
judge
has
a
power
to
an
emotion
for
new
trial
to
review
all
of
the
evidence,
everything
in
the
case.
and
determine
in
his
discretion,
death
sentence
having
been
returned
by
the
jury
whether
the
sentence
should
be
life
instead
of
a
death
sentence.
he
can’t
of
course
go
up
to
death
if
the
jury
returns
life.
but
he
can
in
effect
reduce
the
sentence
and
that
does
not
have
to
be
because
of
some
error
but
because
of
his
appraisal
of
the
--
all
of
the
evidence
in
the
case.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
no,
it
was
my
--
well,
in
my
understanding
your
honor
is
that
it
is
different
but
i’m
certainly
not,
i
have
to
rely
pretty
much
on
what’s
been
said
by
the
parties.
i’m
not
qualified
to
speak
on
that.
i
don’t
think
they
have
that
power.
they
may
have.
we
certainly
have
the
power.
it
is
true
that
the
on
appellate
review,
the
supreme
court
of
california
and
that’s
where
all
death
penalty
cases
go
in
california.
there’s
no
other
review
and
its
automatic
in
all
death
cases.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
i’m
sure
he
would
for
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
i
wouldn’t
want
to
--
i
certainly
wouldn’t
want
to
act
as
if
i
were
an
authority
your
honor.
i
just
don’t
know.
let
me
put
it
that
way.
i
do
know
that
it’s
done
in
california
and
it
doesn’t
have
to
be
done
for
error.
we
done
simply
because
the
judge
in
his
judgment,
but
again
would
no
more
standards
of
the
jury
had
to
start
with
things
that
a
life
sentence
should
be
imposed.
in
addition,
there
is
still
a
further
review
and
i
think
it’s
important
to
make
sure
that
there
is
no
that
this
is
not
an
arbitrary
decision
passed
in
a
vacuum
or
something.
there
is
a
review
by
the
trial
judge.
there
is
a
review
by
the
state
supreme
court,
none
of
the
question
of
whether
it
should
be
a
death
sentence
or
a
life
sentence.
but
on
the
question
of
any
error
that
may
have
occurred
during
the
penalty
trial
and
the
least
error,
will
the
court
reverse
it.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
no.
no,
they
can
review
the
record
your
honor,
for
error
in
the
penalty
trial.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
that’s
the
view,
it’s
--
we
have
one
justice
now
who
is
of
the
view
that
they
can
in
a
death
case
but
the
established
law
in
california
is
that
they
cannot.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
i
think
it
was
six,
yes.
now
those
are
some
of
the
things
but
if
i
could
come
back
to
this
basic
idea,
it
seems
to
me
its
base
on
two
things.
one
is
the,
as
i
said,
it’s
so
difficult
to
attempt
to
formulate
in
advance
this
considerations.
and
the
result
is
that
a
case
comes
along
where
you
--
where
everybody
involved
feels
that
the
death
sentence
should
not
be
imposed.
but
it
may
not
fall
within
some
predetermined
categories.
and
when
you
get
into
things
like
pity
and
sympathy
and
kindness
and
compassion,
how
you
can
reduce
that
to
any
kind
of
a
standard
and
the
due
process
sense
of
the
statute
defining
conduct?
i
don’t
understand
in
the
petitioners
haven’t
told
us.
again
in
california,
for
example
the
jury
is
told
in
the
guilt
case
of
the
case,
any
of
those
two,
any
case.
you
can’t
take
into
account
any
pity
or
sympathy
you
might
feel
for
this
defendant
no
matter
how
down
and
obvious
you
have
to
decide
the
facts.
is
he
guilty
of
murder
whatever
might
be
robbery,
you
have
to
put
pity
and
sympathy
out
of
your
mind.
now,
if
you’re
trying
a
capital
case
and
they’re
given
that
instruction
of
a
guilt
plea
then
you
have
to
correct
that
impression
in
the
penalty
face
because
they
can’t
properly
be
guided
by
such
things
in
determining
penalty
in
sentencing
just
like
a
trial
judge
can
be
take
consideration
or
take
these
things
into
consideration.
and
unless
it’s
the
position
of
the
appellant,
petitioner
here,
that
pity
and
kindness
and
compassion
should
be
excluded
from
the
sentencing
process
and
indeed
must
be
excluded
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law
and
it
seems
to
me
that
he
can’t
prevail.
the
model
code
certainly
says
nothing
as
i
recall
about
kindness
or
compassion.
no
states
to
my
knowledge
has
ever
enacted
standards
of
a
kind
that
are
suggested
here,
the
ones
that
a
model
penal
code
have
been
around
for
some
time
they
have
never
been
adopted
by
anybody.
this
discretionary
sentencing
in
capital
cases
has
been
with
us
just
like
as
i
pointed
out
earlier
was
at
the
instance
of
this
court
some
70
years
ago
that
the
federal
courts
commenced
this
procedure.
we’ve
known
about
it,
we
haven’t
been
offended
by
it.
i
think
the
results
have
been
by
enlarged,
a
vital
large
pretty
good
with
undoubtedly
they’re
always
arguable
cases
but
no
court
has
ever
held
that
this
is
a
constitutional
defect
in
sentencing.
only
two
years
ago,
this
court
agreed
to
adhere
to
the
decision
in
williams
against
new
york
which
in
evaluating
a
sentencing
procedures
in
new
york
in
a
capital
case
permitted
the
trial
judge
to
consider
matters
in
the
probation
report
and
other
sources
and
it
considered
things
that
have
not
been
testified
to
an
open
court
so
that
in
effect
the
defendant
had
no
right
to
cross-examine.
the
witnesses
that
--
and
the
information
sources
of
information
that
the
trial
judge
considered
and
in
that
case,
the
trial
judge
in
the
face
of
a
recommendation
of
a
life
sentence
by
the
jury
after
reviewing
these
matters
that
came
to
him
not
from
the
witness
stand
that
by
way
of
reports
imposed
the
death
sentence
in
his
good
judgment,
again
without
any
standards
as
far
as
i
can
tell
and
this
court
affirmed
it.
and
two
years
ago,
in
patterson
--
specht
against
patterson,
you
said,
you’ve
given
it
some
thought
that
you
adhered
to
that
decision
in
williams
against
new
york
and
it
seems
to
me
they
--
that
of
course
the
issues
are
different
in
this
case.
but
that
the
sentencing
procedure
in
arkansas
and
the
sentencing
procedure
in
california
and
in
the
federal
courts
and
everywhere
in
united
states
as
far
as
i
know
that
this
aspect
of
the
sentencing
procedure
does
comport
with
due
process
of
law
and
with
equal
protection
of
the
laws.
the
--
there
is
no
problem
here
in
my
judgment
of
undue
vagueness
in
the
law.
granted
there
are
no
standard
specifically
set
forth
but
the
definition
of
the
crimes
that
calls
for
capital
punishment,
everywhere
is
very
specific.
certainly,
it’s
in
arkansas
it
is
in
california
those
crimes
are
set
forth
whatever
they
might
be.
whether
in
the
first
degree,
rape,
however
the
legislature
wants
to
apply
it.
and
the
fact
that
the
defendant
doesn’t
know
and
indeed
no
one
knows
and
no
one
in
this
room
knows
whether
if
he
undertakes
a
murder
in
the
first
degree,
a
jury
will
ultimately
return
a
death
sentence
or
a
life
sentence
as
one
of
those
risks
that
he
has
to
take
in
this
life.
he
doesn’t
know
if
governor
will
grant
him
clemency.
he
doesn’t
know
if
the
district
attorney
and
whatever
county
happens
to
be
in
throughout
the
united
states
will
ask
for
a
death
sentence.
he
doesn’t
even
know
what
the
higher
courts
may
rule
in
some
things
that
might
happen
to
him
in
the
course
of
this
procedure.
of
course,
he
doesn’t
know
these
things.
but
he
knows
this
if
he
commits
a
murder
in
the
first
degree.
he
is
subject
to
the
death
penalty.
now
giving
the
jury
the
discretion
to
return
a
life
sentence
was
the
humanitarian
step
this
court
has
recognized
that
and
in
determining
guilt,
and
there
has
to
be
this
prior
determination
of
guilt
before
we
ever
get
around
this
sentencing.
the
defendant
has
the
benefit
of
all
of
the
constitutional
protections.
we
don’t
see
any
unfairness
in
this
situation.
we
don’t
see
any
uneven
application
of
the
law.
the
same
rule
is
applicable
to
everybody
that
goes
before
the
jury.
everybody
who
commits
a
murder
in
the
first
degree
or
rape
in
the
state
of
arkansas,
they
all
have
the
same
opportunity.
be
in
fact
they
even
have
--
they
have
a
better
opportunity
to
seek
a
life
sentence
under
the
discretionary
procedure
than
they
would
under
any
of
these
conceivable
standards.
here
the
whole
thing
is
wide
open.
anything
that
a
defense
attorney
can
conceive
of
to
say
that
might
persuade
a
juror,
mind
you
need
a
unanimous
verdict
in
this
cases.
think
of
its
one
juror
that
there
should
be
a
life
sentence
why
he’s
accomplished
the
purpose
and
the
only
bounds
are
his
own
imagination
and
his
own
ingenuity.
now
again
his
status
are
going
to
limit
that.
there
is
another
point
here
too,
i
think
and
i
forgot
to
mention
that
in
our
discussion
earlier
about
the
california
procedure
that
it
is
clear
in
california
that
you
--
the
trial
judge
can
on
requests
advice
the
jury
about
factors
that
they
might
consider
and
references
made
to
the
model
penal
code.
it
would
have
to
be
made
very
clear
to
the
jury
that
these
were
not
controlling
in
any
sense
but
if
that
were
done,
it
would
certainly,
i
think
the
jury
could
be
told
of
those
factors.
they
can
be
told
they
can
take
kindness
and
so
forth
into
account.
so
we
submit
that
the
mere
absence
of
standards
does
not
in
any
way
make
the
arkansas
procedure
for
that
reason
unconstitutional
if
there
other
objections
that
we
don’t
share
with
arkansas
in
terms
of
procedure,
i’m
sure
the
attorney
general
form
arkansas
was
prepared
to
deal
with
those.
i
have
just
one
closing
remark,
and
that
is
i
think
that
in
light
of
your
decision
in
witherspoon
wherein
you
recognize
that
under
illinois
law
the
conscience
of
the
community
was
focus
on
this
man
and
what
have
you
done.
and
there
was
no
guide
given
to
the
jury
and
you
insisted
that
that
jury
should
be
fairly
composed
and
that
was
undisputed
about
whether
that
one
was
but
nevertheless
it
would
have
to
be
fairly
composed
to
reflect
the
conscience
of
the
community.
that
rule
in
illinois,
in
the
absence
of
standards
is
essentially
the
same
thing.
you
have
to
face
an
arkansas
on
the
same
thing
that
we
have
in
california
and
it
seems
to
me
that
having
recognized
that
and
having
--
making
sure
as
you
have
made
sure
that
the
jury
must
be
a
fair
representation
of
the
community
because
you
are
invoke
in
their
conscience.
you're
invoking
their
--
the
qualities
as
i
have
referred
to
kindness,
compassion,
not
simply
an
arid
determination
of
facts
but
a
real
judgment
in
the
--
and
not
on
the
legal
sense
but
in
the
general
sense.
the
judgment
of
what
should
be
done
with
this
person.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
in
our
brief,
amicus
brief,
we
suggest
that
the
court
should
give
some
consideration
to
that
very
point.
the
case
was
tried
back
in
1962.
we
did
not
at
that
time
have
the
transcripts.
we
thought
it
was
probably
a
good
guess.
there
might
be
a
violation
of
it
--
of
the
witherspoon
rule.
in
the
meantime
and
in
fact
yesterday
morning
--
excuse
me.
i
examined
the
transcript.
it’s
right
here.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
pardon
me?
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
this
is
a
copy,
i
dont
know,
it
looks
like
the
original
to
me
but
here
it
is.
and
i
took
the
opportunity
to
go
over
it.
and
sure
enough
there
are
at
least
seven
jurors
about
in
this.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
it
hasn’t
been
raised
your
honor.
hasn’t
been
raised
apparently,
any
place.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well
you
came
down
--
handed
down
a
ruling
in
witherspoon
which
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
this
is
federal
habeas.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
i
think
you
could.
i
don’t
want
to
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
that’s
my
understanding.
that’s
the
sentence
of
death
is
being
attacked
and
not
the
conviction,
at
least
at
this
point.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
yes.
and
then
another
one
said,
“i
would
not
sentence
the
death
penalty.”
that
i
suppose
you
might
argue
meant
i
wouldn’t
in
any
case
but
it
wasn’t
spelled
out.
there’s
another
one
who
said,
“no
sir,
i
don’t
believe
in
capital
punishment”
and
went
off.
and
as
i
say
there
are
total
of
four
--
a
total
of
seven.
the
last
one
said,
“i
am
against
capital
punishment.”
i
suppose
there
could
be
argument
on
each
side
as
to
whether
or
not
this
complied
with
witherspoon
but
certainly
arguable
and
it
did
not.
we
think
you
could
reach
that.
we
think
that
issue
might
very
well
be
resolved
in
favor
of
the
petitioner
and
that
would
save
him
from
all
that
he
seeks
to
get
at
this
point
and
that
is
to
save
his
life.
having
that
issue,
there’s
no
need
that
you
go
into
this
other
question.
but
we
submit
that
if
you
do,
we
submit
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
of
course
you
don’t
have
the
transcript
before
you
now
but
i’m
sure
you
could
secure
it.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
it’s
not
part
of
the
appendix,
it’s
here.
it’s
on
the
table.
it’s
not
part
of
the
appendix.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
it’s
printed.
yes,
it
is.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
we
certainly
have
no
objection.
belongs
to
arkansas.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
my
time
that
we’ve
been
allotted
has
expired.
thank
you.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
interest
of
california
in
this
case
is
a
fairly
narrow
one,
in
terms
of
the
questions
that
were
--
or
the
issues
that
was
set
forth
by
mr.
amsterdam
at
the
start
of
his
argument.
we
are
not
concerned
about
the
single
verdict
procedure,
because
we
have
in
common
with
a
number
of
other
states,
a
bifurcated
trial,
and
we
have
separate
verdicts
for
both
guilt
and
a
verdict
for
the
penalty
in
capital
cases
only.
otherwise,
almost
all
sentencing
in
california
is
by
the
judge
and
usually
where
the
presentence
report
and
all
a
number
of
other
things.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
mr.
justice
black,
first
of
all
we
don't
have
a
different
jury.
it's
normally
the
same
jury.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
but
it's
a
different
trial.
it's
a
different
face
of
the
trial.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
i
don't
know
categorically,
your
honor.
i
think
mr.
amsterdam
said
about
eight
this
morning,
and
i
would
accept
that
as
an
accurate
statement.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
there
are
always
changes
in
california
law,
your
honor
but
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
no,
i
don't
believe
that
it
has,
at
least
nothing
connects
at
the
moment.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
no,
he
can
only
be
asked
the
same
questions
as
any
other
witness
could
be
asked.
he
could
be
asked
about
a
prior
felony,
and
so
far
as
that
would
impeach
his
credibility.
he
could
be
asked
about
questions
that
might
reflect
on
bias
and
so
forth,
but
he
couldn't
be
asked
generally
about
prior
misconduct.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
to
impeach
his
credibility,
any
witness
can
about
it,
with
a
prior
felony
conviction
in
california.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
no,
i
don't
think
he's
up
to
the
--
anywhere
near
the
same
difficulty.
he
doesn't
have
to
take
the
stand
in
the
guilt
phase,
of
course,
no
comment
can
be
made
on
if
he
doesn't.
he
can
take
the
stand
in
a
penalty
phase,
after
guilt
has
already
been
determine,
and
give
whatever
explanation
he
has.
by
the
same
token,
the
people
can
show
in
that
proceeding,
anything
in
his
history
a
background
that
in
their
judgment
reflects
adversely
on
it.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
that's
true
and
that's
true
and
that's
true
of
any
witness
who
might
be
called
by
anyone.
he's
subject
to
cross
examination,
and
his
credibility
has
to
be
assessed,
just
like
any
other
witness'
credibility.
but
we
don't
have
any
special
rules
as
to
criminal
defendants,
except
that
i
think
there's
more
of
a
tendency
to
limit
cross-examinations,
so
you
don't
get
beyond
the
scope
of
what
he
has
waived
by
taking
the
stand.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
that's
correct
your
honor,
the
state
can
prove
prior
crimes,
if
they
do,
they
have
to
prove
them
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
the
juries
so
instructed
and
things
of
that
nature.
now,
we
are
also
not
concern
with
the
witherspoon
question,
as
that
has
been
presented
here,
leaving
that
to
the
parties.
our
interest
in
this
case,
and
the
reason
we're
appearing
here
is
solely
on
the
question
of
whether
the
constitution
somehow
requires
the
juries
be
given
some
limiting
and
restricting
standards
in
deciding
on
the
question
of
whether
life
imprisonment
or
a
death
sentence
should
be
imposed
in
capital
cases.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor,
those
standards
of
course,
are
very
clear
and
specific
as
to
whether
or
not
there
is
a
murder
on
the
first
degree.
i
presume
a
rape
in
arkansas
or
whatever
the
crime
might
be.
these
would
be
standards,
and
really
limitations
and
restrictions
going
solely
to
the
question
of
penalty,
having
nothing
to
do
with
guilt,
that
having
been
determined
already
by
definition.
it's
done
formally
in
california,
in
arkansas
it
isn't
and
i
don't
want
to
enter
in
that
dispute.
i
would
like
to
clarify
one
point,
because
of
the
national
implications
that
were
made
clear
by
mr.
amsterdam,
and
that's
another
reason
why
we're
here.
in
california,
there
is
a
process,
by
which
the
judge
can
pass
in
his
discretion,
and
it's
the
same
kind
of
absolute
discretion
without
reference
to
any
formal
standards
that
the
jury
is
suppose
to
exercise.
one
there
has
been
a
death
penalty,
and
he
can
if
he
sees
fit
in
light
of
all
the
evidence,
all
of
the
factors
that
are
involved,
reduce
it
to
a
life
sentence,
and
there
it
is
forevermore
a
life
sentence.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
that
is
the
trial
judge.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
he
doesn't
have
to
give
any
reasons
and
probably
it's
better
if
he
didn't,
but
he
has
the
same
scope
of
discretion
that
the
jury
has,
that's
my
point,
there
is
judicial
review
at
the
trial
level.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
the
appellate
court
can
of
course,
find
for
example
the
evidence
isn't
sufficient
for
murder
in
the
first
degree,
and
so
it
make
it
murder
second.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
but
they
have
said,
although
it
was
–
justice
peters
of
the
court
takes
a
counter
review
that
they
will
not,
as
a
matter
of
discretion
and
judgment
reduce
a
death
sentence
to
a
life
sentence.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
that
very
commonly
occurred,
your
honor.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
pardon
me,
your
honor?
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
that's
correct,
you
have
a
different
jury
or
you
can
waive
a
jury
if
he's
so
inclined,
provided
the
people
way
of
his
wealth.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
no
one
can
question
the
judge,
in
terms
of
an
appeal
from
his
judgment,
that's
correct
your
honor.
now,
there
may
be
some
questions
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
no,
it's
a
--
i
think
there's
another
facet
of
the
situation
in
california,
as
well,
that
distinguishes
it
from
a
single
verdict
situation
and
meet
some
of
the
objections
that
have
been
raised
here,
and
that
is
the
objection
generally
that
--
what
the
jury
does
on
penalties
is
an
uninformed
judgment,
maybe
it's
arbitrary,
maybe
it's
even
discriminatory.
in
california
with
the
entire
procedure
is
such
that
evidence
can
be
introduced
by
both
sides
and
commonly
is,
but
it's
not
unusual
at
all.
a
psychiatric
evidence
can
be
introduced,
sociological
evidence,
anything
that
in
the
opinion
of
the
district
attorney
or
the
defense
attorney
might
carry
some
weight
with
jury
on
the
matter
of
penalty.
all
of
this
evidence
comes
in
and
the
only
restrictions
that
i'm
familiar
with
are
those
upon
the
prosecution,
which
cannot
show
certain
things.
for
example,
you
can't
prove
a
crime,
unless
you
can
prove
it
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
and
if
you
fail
on
that
burden
of
proof,
this
would
be
as
to
prior
crimes.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
yes,
you
could
do
that.
what
i
had
in
mind,
crimes
that
are
not
necessarily
been
reduced
to
a
conviction,
those
could
be
proven
too.
or
the
defendant
can
prove
his
good
record
or
whatever
he
thinks
may
be
in
his
behalf,
he
can
call
witnesses,
he
call
clergymen,
psychiatrist,
as
i
say,
and
a
like
(voice
overlap).
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
there
is
a
very
protracted,
a
very
commonly,
very
protracted
summing
up,
yes.
full
argument
on
both
sides,
and
that
at
that
point,
the
case
is
submitted
to
the
jury.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
the
instruction
is
based
basically
upon
the
statute
and
in
light
of
mr.
amsterdam's
remarks
this
morning
about
the
lack
of
legislative
determination
of
some
of
these
problems.
i
took
a
look
at
our
statute,
which
is
section
190.1
of
the
penal
code,
rather
long
section,
but
it
explains
in
a
good
deal
of
detail
and
nature
of
the
penalty
hearing,
what
kind
of
evidence
can
be
introduced,
and
what
the
jury
is
suppose
to
do.
now,
they're
not
left
in
the
dark
by
any
means.
it's
provided
specifically
that
evidence
may
be
produced
at
the
penalty
trial
of
the
circumstances
surrounding
the
crime,
of
the
defendant's
background
and
history,
and
of
any
facts
and
aggravation
or
mitigation
of
the
penalty.
the
determination
and
this
is
what
they
say
to
the
jury
and
to
the
judge,
this
is
what
our
legislature
is
so,
the
determination
of
the
penalty
of
life
imprisonment
or
death
shall
be
in
the
discretion
of
the
court
or
jury,
trying
the
issue
of
fact
on
the
evidence
presented.
and
the
penalty
fixed
shall
be
expressly
stated
in
the
decision
or
verdict.
now,
i
think
it's
clear
that
this
does
not
anticipate
any
kind
of
an
arbitrary
judgment
by
the
jury
or
the
judge.
and
he
is
to
make
the
--
he
or
the
juries
to
make
the
decision
on
the
evidence
presented.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
that's
essentially
--
you
may
consider
all
of
the
evidence
of
those
things
that
you've
just
mentioned,
your
honor.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
it's
phrased
in
terms
of
you
may
do
this
and
you
may
do
that,
but
basically
it's
the
statutory
language.
they're
also
told
this,
and
this
seems
to
be
the
heart
of
the
petitioner's
compliant.
however,
it
is
not
essential
to
your
decision
that
you
find
mitigating
circumstances
on
the
one
hand
or
evidence
in
aggravation
of
the
offense
on
the
other.
and
this
of
course,
is
the
more
or
less
the
--
represents
the
historical
process
that
was
discussed
this
morning.
they're
also
told
this,
and
i
think
this
excludes
arbitrariness,
and
i
think
it
excludes
any
of
the
things
that
we
heard
this
morning.
notwithstanding
facts
if
any
proved
in
mitigation
or
aggravation.
in
determining
which
punishment
shall
be
inflicted,
you
are
entirely
free
to
act
according
to
you
own
judgment,
conscience,
and
absolute
discretion.
that
verdict
must
express
the
individual
opinion
of
each
juror.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
i
think
that's
true
mr.
justice
harlan,
and
i
think
perhaps
we've
too
readily
accept
that
the
working
proposition
with
the
purposes
of
argument
that
there
are
no
standards.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
that
is
--
those
are
two
words,
“absolute
discretion.”
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
it's
a
standard,
as
standards
have
developed
in
this
kind
of
--
this
(voice
overlap).
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
certainly
not,
i
can't
imagine
anymore
specific
statement
of
the
legislative
intent,
and
its
clear
recognition
of
the
problem.
now,
it
may
not
be
the
best
solution,
it
may
be
better,
it
may
be
more
logical,
and
it
may
be
you've
added
symmetry
to
the
law
to
say,
you
have
to
have
mandatory
death
standards.
it
may
be
that
the
–
or
standards
for
mandatory
death
sentences,
it
may
be
the
constitution
requires
that
this
court
move
back
70
or
100
years,
i
suppose,
and
say
well
you
have
a
death
sentence
that
has
to
be
a
mandatory
sentence
with
no
discretion.
i
find
that
hard
to
believe.
the
decision
of
this
court
over
70
years
ago
in
winston
against
the
united
states,
today
i
think
as
well
as
any
other
--
anything
i've
ever
read
sums
up
the
kind
of
considerations
that
i
think
any
of
us
would
agree,
should
be
considered
by
a
jury.
and
i'm
not
talking
about
impermissible
considerations,
but
you'll
recall
in
winston,
the
court,
this
court
rejected
a
standard
and
held
that
a
standard
should
not
be
implied,
that
death
should
be
returned
in
the
absence
of
mitigating
circumstances.
now,
that's
a
standard
of
sorts,
perhaps
not
a
very
specific
one,
but
it
is
a
standard.
this
court
held
that
that
did
not
express
the
intent
of
congress,
as
manifest
in
the
legislation.
but
in
discussing
this,
the
court
pointed
to
some
of
the
things
that
they
thought
should
be
considered,
and
would
seem
to
me
they
should
be
considered
today.
they
said,
how
far
considerations
of
age,
sex,
ignorance,
illness,
or
intoxication
of
human
passion
or
weakness,
of
sympathy
or
clemency,
or
the
irrevocableness
of
an
executed
sentence
of
death
or
an
apprehension
that
explanatory
facts
may
exists,
which
have
not
been
brought
to
light
or
any
other
consideration
or
whatever,
should
be
allowed
to
wait
in
deciding
the
question
whether
the
accused
should
or
should
not
be
capitally
punished
as
committed
by
the
act
of
congress
to
the
sound
discretion
of
the
jury
and
of
the
jury
alone.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
it's
certainly
a
discussion
of
the
factors,
a
statement
listing
of
the
factors
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
yes
it
does,
your
honor,
we've
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
yes,
we
quoted
that.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
that's
right,
and
we
think
in
doing
that,
and
the
legislature
in
setting
up
the
structure
before
doing
that
is
not
required
to
limit
or
restrict
the
discretion
of
the
jury
in
anyway.
that
essentially
what
standard
means
in
this
context,
i
think.
certainly,
it
doesn't
mean
that
anyone
can
be
taken
off
the
street
and
because
the
jury
doesn't
like
him
executed.
the
ball
of
question
arises
only
after
a
conviction
of
a
capital
offense
and
as
to
that
the
standards
are
very
strict.
historically,
it's
clear
that
the
motivation
here
was
to
permit
juries
to
draw
distinctions
in
terms
of
humane
and
emotional
considerations,
and
i
think
the
thought
in
the
minds
of
legislatures,
that
we
can't
list
everything
that
might
be
material.
we
cannot
anticipate
everything
and
we
don't
want
to
limit
the
discretion
of
the
jurors.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
that's
the
standard,
pardon
me.
in
death,
in
capital
cases?
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
it's
up
to
the
defendant
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
he
has
the
right
to
a
jury,
if
he
waives
it
we
permit
sentencing
by
the
judge.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
none,
except
those
that
i
have
alluded
to
and
supplied
to
the
jury.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
in
a
capital
case,
i
don't
think
a
capital
case
would
be
handled
exactly
that
way.
i
think
you
would
a
more
formal
proceeding,
that
simply
presentence
report.
it
would
certainly
be
appropriate.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
i
believe
that's
true,
yes
sir,
it
would
be
--
that's
not
uncommon
to
have
a
trial
before
the
judge
on
this
issue
of
penalty,
with
the
same
evidence,
with
the
same
considerations
in
mind.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
exactly,
and
that
happens
not
infrequently.
and
this
--
it
seems
to
be
underlying,
this
whole
argument
of
the
petitioner
here,
the
notion
that
unless
there
is
uniform
treatment
handed
out
in
convicted
criminals,
that
there
has
been
some
violation
of
some
provision
of
the
constitution.
now,
if
there's
one
thing
that's
clear
over
the
last
half
century,
it
is
--
and
this
court
expressed
very
clearly
and
noted
with
approval,
the
practice
of
fitting
the
punishment
not
to
the
crime,
but
to
the
offender.
and
it's
not
uncommon
to
have
a
whole
variety
of
penalties
handed
out
to
a
number
of
people,
who
have
committed
precisely
the
same
crime,
because
you
look
to
their
background,
you
look
to
their
role
in
the
crime,
you
look
to
the
nature
of
what
each
of
those
persons
did.
and
the
court
has
found
nothing
of
constitutional
dimensions
in
any
way
to
bar
this
kind
of
procedure.
now,
we
think
that
the
leaving
to
the
jury,
the
opportunity
to
extend
mercy
to
a
man
who
is
convicted
of
a
crime,
potentially
involved
in
a
capital
punishment,
is
simply
an
application
of
fitting
the
punishment
to
the
offender
and
not
to
the
crime.
now,
there's
nothing
--
not
only
is
there
nothing
wrong
with
that,
we
think
that's
a
--
and
i
think
there's
general
agreement
among
people
who
know
about
these
things
that
this
what
science
has
taught
us,
this
is
what
everything
we've
learned
has
taught
us.
and
the
capital
sentencing
is
very
typical
of
other
sentencing
in
that
respect
in
fitting
the
punishment
to
the
offender.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
that's
true
your
honor,
but
these
are
standards,
and
as
i
understand
it,
we're
mitigating
circumstances
are
listed
as
in
the
model
penal
code,
that
is
it,
if
you
don't
come
under
one
of
those,
there's
no
way
you
can
go
to
the
jury
and
say
this
poor
man
should
have
his
life
spared,
because
he
was
good
to
his
mother
or
something
like
and
we
can
do
that
in
california.
the
only
limitation
on
the
defense
in
california
is
the
ingenuity
and
the
resourcefulness
of
the
defense.
if
he
think
of
something
that
might
appeal
to
one
person
on
the
jury,
which
is
really
all
you
need
because
you
need
unanimous
jury.
he's
free
to
urge
it,
and
we
see
nothing
wrong
with
that,
and
we
don't
see
anything
that
necessarily
or
even
logically
would
result
in
arbitrariness.
we
think
it's
fair,
and
has
worked
pretty
well
over
the
years.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
there
are
alternative
provisions,
if
the
jury
disagrees,
the
judge
can
either
impanel
a
jury
or
he
can
take
the
case
and
give
him
a
life
sentence.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
that
judge
can.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
no,
he
can't
do
anymore
than
that.
now,
i
think
if
look
a
little
--
and
i
think
we
have
to
look
at
what
is
it
that
the
states
should
do,
and
what
should
the
federal
government
do,
if
what
we
do
now
is
wrong,
in
terms
of
standards.
and
i'm
not
talking
about
the
single
verdict,
but
in
terms
of
standards,
if
what
we're
doing
now
is
wrong,
what
is
it
that
we
should
do?
now,
this
is
something
that
was
covered
in
witherspoon
very
carefully.
at
least
in
noting
what
was
not
forbidden
in
witherspoon,
and
giving
the
states
guidelines
as
to
what
to
do
with
these
cases
when
they
came
back.
now
in
listening
to
the
argument
today
and
in
the
reading
the
briefs,
i
haven't
seen
anything
that's
specifically
points
to
the
what
the
states
could
do
to
meet
the
standards
that
the
petitioners
submit
have
to
be
established.
they
say
if
you
look
at
the
model
penal
code,
you'll
find
one
you've
limited
defendants,
there
are
things
they
can't
urge.
and
i
don't
think
the
people
want
that
situation.
even
under
the
model
penal
code
you
get
down
to
formulations
like
this,
it's
easy
to
talk
about
standards,
but
what
is
the
final
formulation
to
a
jury
under
the
model
penal
code.
well,
if
found
an
aggravating
circumstance,
which
could
be
--
for
example
he
killed
more
than
one
person
or
he
committed
a
felony
in
certain
kinds
and
in
connecting
with
the
killing.
if
you
find
an
aggravating
circumstance,
you
may
return
a
death
a
sentence,
you
don't
have
to,
you
may,
but
then
you
have
to
determine
whether
the
mitigating
circumstances
are
not
sufficiently
substantial
to
call
for
leniency.
now,
what's
the
jury's
told,
that's
the
instruction.
and
that
would
be
my
guess
that
a
jury
would
go
back
and
talk
about
these
mitigating
circumstances,
and
come
back
with
a
judge,
and
say
well
you
told
us
what
we
could
consider.
but
how
do
we
weigh
each
of
these
items,
and
how
we
determine
when
a
particular
circumstance
is
sufficiently
substantial
to
call
for
leniency.
and
i
think
the
judge
would
have
to
say,
“well,
you
use
your
discretion,
that's
what
then
your
sound
discretion.”
so,
where
are
you
except
that
you
have
limited
the
defendant,
and
you
set
up
a
kind
of
an
artificial
and
a
structure
that
meets
what
the
petitioners
think
all
statutes
should
consist
of
and
you
ignored
the
experience
of
all
the
states
that
have
the
death
sentence,
and
the
united
states
government,
and
for
what
end.
i
think
as
the
end
would
be
a
jury,
still
left
with
having
to
come
to
that
fundamental
decision.
is
this
man
going
to
die
or
is
he
going
to
live,
and
bare
in
mind
that
it's
a
man
who
has
committed
a
capital
offense
and
has
been
found
guilty.
it's
not
someone
off
the
street.
and
one
thing
that
has
been
emphasized
in
california,
and
there
are
number
of
cases
that
repeat
this
theme,
and
it
runs
through
all
of
the
death
penalty
cases.
we
have
many,
many
cases
that
deal
only
with
penalty
procedures,
many
appellate
decisions.
and
we've
had
countless
retrials,
solely
on
penalty,
but
a
theme
that
runs
through
all
of
those
decisions
is
this,
you've
got
to
convince
the
juror
that
it's
his
individual
responsibility
for
that
verdict.
when
he
goes
out
of
that
courtroom
or
he
comes
back
with
a
verdict,
it's
his
decision
that
this
man
should
die.
he
cannot
leave
the
decision
in
someone
else's
hand.
you
can't
tell
him
the
governor
may
grant
clemency,
because
he's
not
supposed
to
think
about
such
things.
if
he
mentions
anything
about
parole,
he's
not
supposed
to
worry
about
the
parole
board
making
a
mistake.
it
has
to
be
his
individual
decision,
and
anything
that
has
impeached
that
individual
decision
has
been
held
bad
in
california.
now,
i
think
this
is
the
--
the
best
way
to
administer
this
system
if
the
death
penalty
is
to
continue
and
its
validity
asset
is
not
an
issue
in
this
case.
if
it's
going
to
continue,
and
if
you're
going
to
conclude
that
not
every
member,
not
every
person
who
commits
murder
one,
should
be
executed.
then,
i
think
that
the
--
what
we
do
is
the
fairest
and
the
most
rational,
if
i
may
use
that
word,
way
of
concluding
who
should
be
executed
that
i
have
heard
about.
and
i
think
it's
far
preferable
to
the
model
penal
code,
and
i
certainly
think
the
legislature
would
reject
notions
of
mandatory
death
sentences,
in
light
of
our
whole
experience.
emphasizing
this
individual
responsibility,
i
think
gives
the
defendant
the
fair
shake,
and
emphasizing
to
the
jury
that
they
have
to
consider
the
evidence,
that
they
have
to
consider
things
that
are
produced
in
court,
excludes,
i
think
the
possibility
of
any
of
the
arbitrariness
that's
been
mentioned
here,
earlier.
i
have
no
doubt
that
a
jury
in
california
can't
point
to
any
decision,
but
i
have
no
doubt
that
if
a
defendant
thought
that
racial
prejudice,
status,
class,
position,
or
anything
of
that
sort
might
possibly
influence
any
single
juror
that
he
could
ask
the
judge
to
please
instruct
them
to
get
such
things
out
of
their
minds.
i
don't
think
those
--
it's
very
unlikely
that
that
would
enter
the
minds
of
the
jurors,
but
if
there
were
any
possibility,
that
could
certainly
be
excluded.
they
wouldn't
have
anymore
of
a
standard,
but
should
be
telling
you,
you
can't
rely
on
these
things.
that
could
be
done,
whether
it
could
be
done
in
arkansas,
i
don't
know,
probably
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
i
think
mr.
amsterdam
gave
the
figure
of
85
to
90,
which
about
thelast
i
heard.
i
could
get
the
precise
figure
for
you,
your
honor.
but
it's
in
that
dimension.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
yes
sir,
it
does.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
i
don't
know
about
the
statistics
over
time
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
accumulation
at
the
moment
is
due
to
the
stays
over
the
last
eight
years.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
yes,
they
have.
i
think
the
last
figure
for
jury
verdicts
of
death
that
i
saw
was
around
20.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
in
terms
of
numbers,
i
don't
mr.
justice
black.
i
have
no
information
on
that
as
far
as
the
number.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
certainly.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
i
can
certainly
try
to
and
if
i
can
get
it
out,
i'd
be
glad
to
supply
the
court.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
i
think
that's
the
last
figure
i
saw.
we
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
oh!
these
go
back,
my
gosh!
they
go
back
ten
years.
i
mean
for
one
year,
there
were
some
20
(voice
overlap).
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
in
a
single
year.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
and
the
80
or
the
90
or
whatever
it
is
goes
--
i
know
of
some
that
go
back
at
least
ten
years.
so,
i
think
that's
a
typical
of
the
situation
arising
from
stays.
and
i
think
the
submission
of
the
petitioner
here
that
this
court
should,
as
far
as
the
standards
issue
goes,
as
i
understood
mr.
amsterdam
this
morning,
in
effect
or
it
says
it
directly,
set
aside
505
approximately
death
sentences
imposed
throughout
the
united
states.
for
some
defect,
that
it
is
also
submitted
cannot
be
corrected
at
least
in
terms
of
anything
that
we've
been
able
to
discuss
here
today
and
anything
that
you
could
tell
to
the
states
and
to
the
congress
of
the
united
states,
in
terms
of
this
is
what
you
should
do,
instead
of
what
you've
done.
i
think
this
would
be
a
very
unfortunate
situation.
and
what
the
inability
to
articulate
standards,
i
think
doesn't
show
a
lack
of
resourcefulness,
but
it
shows
us
of
the
equalities
that
are
involved
here
and
the
problems
that
are
involved
here
are
just
such
that
we
cannot
reduce
the
problem
to
specific
factors
and
way
each
any
arbitrary
manner.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
i
think
you
have
to
--
well,
you
would
have
to
redefine
the
crime
and
say
in
effect
will
only
allow
the
death
penalty
in
a
smaller
class
of
cases.
as
your
honor
said,
in
certain
kinds
of
rape
or
by
the
same
token
in
murder,
and
there's
been
no
suggestion
here
that
state
of
california
has
gone
too
far
in
defining
first-degree
murder
or
brought
in
cases
that
constitutionally
can't
be
brought
in.
and
as
i
understand
the
argument,
there
would
be
no
objection
whatever,
as
far
as
this
argument
goes,
if
the
state
of
california
said
humane
considerations
don't
concern
us,
we'll
impose
a
death
penalty
straight
out,
as
to
every
man
convicted
of
murder
in
the
first
degree.
and
i
can't
believe
that
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
requires
that
the
people
of
california
take
that
view,
which
100
years
ago
might
have
been
acceptable,
but
it's
not
acceptable
today,
simply
for
these
artificial
reasons.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
i
don't
think
you
can
mr.
justice
black,
and
meet
the
needs
of
the
society
and
anticipate
giving
the
defendant
every
opportunity
to
show
that
his
life
should
be
spared.
and
i
don't
see
how
you
can
put
qualities,
as
i
mentioned
a
year
ago
of
mercy
and
compassion
in
a
scale
of
standards.
and
assign
some
arbitrary
weight
or
even
if
you
please
define
what
mercy
or
compassion
mean.
and
i
don't
think
that
judges
are
anymore
capable
of
extending
mercy
than
the
citizens
on
a
jury.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
no,
it
plays
no
role
whatever
in
the
death
sentencing,
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
oh!
i'm
sure
there
is,
there's
debate
about
everything.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
no,
i'm
not,
i
think
a
bill
has
been
introduced,
one
always
is,
i
don't
think
it
is
really
a
major
public
issue
at
the
moment.
thank
you.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i’m
here
on
behalf
of
the
state
of
california
as
amicus
curiae,
in
behalf
of
the
respondent,
and
with
the
permission
of
the
attorney
general
of
arkansas
speaking
here
particularly
and
exclusively
with
respect
to
the
first
question
that
is
presented
in
this
case.
california
and
arkansas
in
this
matter
of
sentencing
procedures
in
capital
cases
share
really
only
one
common
element
and
that
is
the
element
of
living
it
to
the
jury
to
determine
whether
or
not
life
sentence
should
be
imposed
instead
of
a
death
sentence
without
any
standards,
without
any
restrictions
without
as
we
put
it
in
our
instruction,
in
your
absolute
and
sole
discretion.
that’s
the
common
element
we
share
and
that’s
why
we’re
here
and
that’s
why
we’re
concerned
about
this
case.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
yes,
we
do
your
honor.
we
have
a
so-called
bifurcated
trial
where
the
--
at
the
outset
that
jury
returns
the
verdict
on
guilt
and
on
guilt
alone,
and
then
usually
a
couple
of
weeks
later,
they
start
a
penalty
hearing.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
normally
it’s
the
same
jury.
the
trial
judge
has
the
authority
to
convene
a
new
jury
upon
good
cause
shown.
but
normally,
it
is
the
same
jury.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
yes,
it
is.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
no,
it
has
to
be
done
in
two
stages
in
every
case.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
it’s
been
the
law
as
long
as
i
can
even
concern
about
it.
i
guess
since
--
it
must
be
a
good
15
years,
maybe
longer
than
that.
i
really
don’t
know.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
pardon
me,
your
honor?
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
we
had
a
unitary
trial
as
they
do
in
arkansas
and
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
in
california?
at
the
present
time.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
yes,
we
do.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
very,
very
little
jury
sentencing.
it
wasn’t
a
great
a
while.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
but
very
little.
the
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
that’s
one
of
the
reasons
that
we’re
here
your
honor.
this
issue
was
very
thoroughly
got
into
before
the
california
supreme
courts
last
year
and
this
particular
attack
on
the
question
of
lack
of
standards
was
raised
and
resolved
by
the
california
supreme
court
in
favor
of
the
established
practice.
so
we
submit
that
it
is
valid
and
unconstitutional
for
a
jury
to
not
to
be
restricted
in
determining
whether
the
return
of
life
sentence
instead
of
a
death
sentence.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
that’s
right.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
that’s
correct.
well,
basically
the,
it
seems
to
me
the
same
rule
is
followed
in
arkansas
as
far
as
the
lack
of
any
standards
or
any
restrictions
on
the
jury
is
concerned
is
precisely
the
same
rule
that
this
court
required
in
the
winston
case
some
70
years
ago.
when
you
held
that
it
was
improper
for
a
trial
judge
to
give
a
standard
to
the
jury
and
to
say
to
them
you
should
return
a
death
sentence
unless
you
find
mitigating
circumstances
in
this
case.
now
you
held
that
was
not
correct
that
the
trial
judge
should
leave
it
to
the
jury
in
their
absolute
discretion
and
not
tilt
the
scale
one
way
or
the
other.
now
that
is
precisely
the
case
in
california.
and
the
jury
has
told
that
in
no
uncertain
terms
and
it’s
my
understanding
that
that
is
the
case
in
arkansas.
but
i
want
to
make
it
clear
that
on
this
question
of
the
unitary
trial,
we
do
not
express
any
view
because
we,
in
this
guilt
proceeding,
meet
the
objections
that
are
raised
in
terms
of
information
being
made
available
to
the
jury.
both
sides
are
free
to
put
in
evidence
in
mitigation
or
evidence
in
aggravation.
they’re
both
free
to
go
into
the
background
of
the
defendant
and
to
go
into
anything
that
is
relevant.
of
course
it
has
to
be
competent
evidence.
and
it
is
very
common
to
call
psychiatrist.
the
defendant
may
call
a
psychiatrist
who
says
he’s
examined
the
defendant
and
is
familiar
with
criminal
characters
and
is
in
his
judgment
this
man
can
be
rehabilitated.
now,
there’s
all
sorts
of
evidence
and
certainly
all
of
the
things
that
would
go
into
judge
sentencing
on
the
basis
of
a
probation
report
or
a
diagnostic
reports
in
our
non-capital
cases.
so,
i
think
as
far
as
that
objection
is
raised
and
of
course
it’s
tied
into
the
lack
of
standards,
we
meet
that
very
well
in
california.
now,
i’m
not
so
sure
it’s
a
benefit
to
the
defendant.
certainly,
the
bifurcated
trials
enacted
as
a
means
of
giving
a
jury
the
fullest
information
before
past
sentence.
and
i
think
that’s
a
good
idea.
to
say
with
the
benefits,
the
defendant
is
something
else
again
because
the
defendant
is
stuck
with
his
own
record.
he
made
his
life
and
if
it
hasn’t
been
a
good
one
he’ll
suffer
for
it
in
the
penalty
trial.
there’s
no
question
about
it.
and
it
can
be
very
difficult
for
the
defendant
whether
or
not
in
the
long
run
it’s
better
to
bifurcate
or
whether
it’s
better
and
gives
the
defendant
a
better
shot
at
it
to
let
it
all
go
in
one
trial,
limit
the
jury
to
what’s
admissible
on
the
murder
charge
or
rape
charge
or
whatever
is
quite
another
question.
in
any
event,
we
recede
on
the
bifurcated
trial.
we
also
have
some
previsions
for
review
which
have
been
mentioned
in
the
briefs
particularly
filed
by
the
petitioner
who
argues
that
the
arkansas
jury
verdict
is
under
review.
unreviewable
for
all
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
at
the
end
of
the
penalty
jury
trial,
the
jury
is
instructed
in
a
standard
instruction
that
it
is
the
duty
of
the
jury
to
determine
which
of
the
penalty
is
either
death
sentence
or
life
imprisonment
should
we
impose.
i
won’t
read
the
whole
thing
but
just
basically,
you
should
consider
all
of
the
evidence
received
here
in
court
presented
by
the
people
and
defendants
throughout
the
trial
before
this
jury.
and
that
would
normally
include
all
the
evidence
on
the
guilt
face
as
well.
you
may
consider,
may
also
consider
all
of
the
evidence
of
the
circumstances
surrounding
a
crime
of
the
defendant’s
background
and
history.
and
of
the
facts
in
aggravation
or
mitigation
of
the
penalty
which
has
been
received
here
in
court.
however,
it
is
not
essential
to
your
decision
that
you
find
mitigating
circumstances
on
the
one
hand
or
evidence
in
aggravation
of
the
offense
on
the
other.
it’s
the
law
of
the
state
that
every
person
guilty
of
murder
in
the
first
degree
shall
suffer
death
or
confinement
in
the
state
prison
for
life
at
the
discretion
of
the
jury.
and
then
they’re
told
they
have
to
indicate
in
their
verdict
which
of
the
two
either
death
as
its
put
here
or
life
they
prefer.
and
then
they’re
told
there’s
notwithstanding
facts
if
any
proved
in
mitigation
or
aggravation.
in
determining
which
punishment
shall
be
inflicted,
you
are
entirely
free
to
act
according
to
your
own
judgment,
conscience,
and
absolute
discretion.
that
verdict
must
express
the
individual
opinion
of
each
juror.
beyond
prescribing
the
two
alternative
penalties,
the
law
itself
provides
no
standard
for
the
guidance
of
the
jury
and
the
selection
of
the
penalty
but
rather
commits
the
whole
matter
of
determining
which
of
the
two
penalties
shall
be
fixed
to
the
judgment,
conscience,
and
absolute
discretion
of
the
jury.
and
the
determination
of
that
matter
if
the
jury
does
agree,
it
must
be
anonymous
as
to
which
of
the
two
penalties
is
imposed.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
i
don’t
--it
certainly
not
set
forth
in
full
your
honor.
it
may
be
referred
to.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
i’d
be
very
happy
to
do
them.
there
are
some
other
instructions
that
come
in
for
example
at
california
supreme
court
had
a
great
problem
over
the
last
few
years
about
arguments
that
while
this
man
if
he
give
him
a
life
sentence
might
be
paroled
after
seven
years
and
go
back
and
commit
another
crime
and
we
have
a
special
instruction
now
that
covers
that
face,
what
a
life
sentence
means.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
pardon
me?
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
that’s
--
see,
it's
quite
a
long
one
your
honor
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
what
it
is
basically
is
that
the
jury
is
told
that
a
life
sentence
means
that
he
may
be
paroled
at
some
time.
but
that
it’s
up
to
the
adult
authority
to
determine
that’s
a
separate
agency
in
california
to
determine
when
if
ever
he
is
released
and
in
general,
you’re
not
suppose
to
be
concerned
about
that
anyhow.
they’ll
do
their
job.
properly,
you
do
your
job
properly.
that’s
the
gist
of
it.
that
he
can
be
paroled
but
they
shouldn’t
enter
into
your
considerations
as
yours.
i
--
we
submit
that
the
california
procedure
and
i
think
it’s
basically
the
same
on
its
element
of
lack
of
standards
was
adopted
originally
to
benefit
the
defendant
--
defendants
in
capital
cases
and
its
easier
to
say
that
the
legislature
passed
the
buck
that
it
didn’t
want
to
decide
the
hard
question
of
who
should
be
executed
and
who
shouldn’t
be.
but
i
don’t
think
that
was
the
basis
for
it.
i
think
the
basis
for
it
was
in
the
experience
of
all
of
us
who
know
anything
about
capital
cases
that
is
impossible,
at
least
i
think
its
impossible
to
set
out
in
advance
those
considerations
exclusively.
new
cases
come
along.
new
situations
developed.
some
of
the
considerations
are
those
referred
to
human
qualities
and
emotions
that
we
can’t
reduced
to
a
formula.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well
i
certainly
didn’t
mean
your
honor
to
convey
the
impression
that
the
two
systems
are
the
same
or
that
if
one
falls,
the
other
must
inevitably
fall
but
we,
and
we
do
not
identify
our
system
with
arkansas.
in
fact,
i
have
attempted
to
point
out
here
some
of
the
differentiating
factors.
but
in
--
when
you
go
pin
it
right
down
to
the
question
of
lack
of
standards
and
isolate
that
i
think
we
are
in
the
same
footing.
now,
it
may
be
that
there
are
other
aspects
of
the
procedure
which
would
say
that
even
if
the
court
felt
there
was
some
defect
in
the
arkansas
procedure.
we
certainly
hope
to
the
court
would
recognize
the
national
impact
of
its
rulings
and
that’s
one
of
the
reasons
that
we
wanted
to
present
our
position
here
and
that
our
state
supreme
court
has
just
resolve
these
questions
squarely
and
upheld
the
absence
of
the
standards.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
it
was
four
to
three,
your
honor.
there
is
one
other
face
of
the
differentiation
in
our
system.
your
honor,
after
the
jury
comes
to
its
verdict
the
trial
judge
has
a
power
to
an
emotion
for
new
trial
to
review
all
of
the
evidence,
everything
in
the
case.
and
determine
in
his
discretion,
death
sentence
having
been
returned
by
the
jury
whether
the
sentence
should
be
life
instead
of
a
death
sentence.
he
can’t
of
course
go
up
to
death
if
the
jury
returns
life.
but
he
can
in
effect
reduce
the
sentence
and
that
does
not
have
to
be
because
of
some
error
but
because
of
his
appraisal
of
the
--
all
of
the
evidence
in
the
case.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
no,
it
was
my
--
well,
in
my
understanding
your
honor
is
that
it
is
different
but
i’m
certainly
not,
i
have
to
rely
pretty
much
on
what’s
been
said
by
the
parties.
i’m
not
qualified
to
speak
on
that.
i
don’t
think
they
have
that
power.
they
may
have.
we
certainly
have
the
power.
it
is
true
that
the
on
appellate
review,
the
supreme
court
of
california
and
that’s
where
all
death
penalty
cases
go
in
california.
there’s
no
other
review
and
its
automatic
in
all
death
cases.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
i’m
sure
he
would
for
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
i
wouldn’t
want
to
--
i
certainly
wouldn’t
want
to
act
as
if
i
were
an
authority
your
honor.
i
just
don’t
know.
let
me
put
it
that
way.
i
do
know
that
it’s
done
in
california
and
it
doesn’t
have
to
be
done
for
error.
we
done
simply
because
the
judge
in
his
judgment,
but
again
would
no
more
standards
of
the
jury
had
to
start
with
things
that
a
life
sentence
should
be
imposed.
in
addition,
there
is
still
a
further
review
and
i
think
it’s
important
to
make
sure
that
there
is
no
that
this
is
not
an
arbitrary
decision
passed
in
a
vacuum
or
something.
there
is
a
review
by
the
trial
judge.
there
is
a
review
by
the
state
supreme
court,
none
of
the
question
of
whether
it
should
be
a
death
sentence
or
a
life
sentence.
but
on
the
question
of
any
error
that
may
have
occurred
during
the
penalty
trial
and
the
least
error,
will
the
court
reverse
it.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
no.
no,
they
can
review
the
record
your
honor,
for
error
in
the
penalty
trial.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
that’s
the
view,
it’s
--
we
have
one
justice
now
who
is
of
the
view
that
they
can
in
a
death
case
but
the
established
law
in
california
is
that
they
cannot.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
i
think
it
was
six,
yes.
now
those
are
some
of
the
things
but
if
i
could
come
back
to
this
basic
idea,
it
seems
to
me
its
base
on
two
things.
one
is
the,
as
i
said,
it’s
so
difficult
to
attempt
to
formulate
in
advance
this
considerations.
and
the
result
is
that
a
case
comes
along
where
you
--
where
everybody
involved
feels
that
the
death
sentence
should
not
be
imposed.
but
it
may
not
fall
within
some
predetermined
categories.
and
when
you
get
into
things
like
pity
and
sympathy
and
kindness
and
compassion,
how
you
can
reduce
that
to
any
kind
of
a
standard
and
the
due
process
sense
of
the
statute
defining
conduct?
i
don’t
understand
in
the
petitioners
haven’t
told
us.
again
in
california,
for
example
the
jury
is
told
in
the
guilt
case
of
the
case,
any
of
those
two,
any
case.
you
can’t
take
into
account
any
pity
or
sympathy
you
might
feel
for
this
defendant
no
matter
how
down
and
obvious
you
have
to
decide
the
facts.
is
he
guilty
of
murder
whatever
might
be
robbery,
you
have
to
put
pity
and
sympathy
out
of
your
mind.
now,
if
you’re
trying
a
capital
case
and
they’re
given
that
instruction
of
a
guilt
plea
then
you
have
to
correct
that
impression
in
the
penalty
face
because
they
can’t
properly
be
guided
by
such
things
in
determining
penalty
in
sentencing
just
like
a
trial
judge
can
be
take
consideration
or
take
these
things
into
consideration.
and
unless
it’s
the
position
of
the
appellant,
petitioner
here,
that
pity
and
kindness
and
compassion
should
be
excluded
from
the
sentencing
process
and
indeed
must
be
excluded
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law
and
it
seems
to
me
that
he
can’t
prevail.
the
model
code
certainly
says
nothing
as
i
recall
about
kindness
or
compassion.
no
states
to
my
knowledge
has
ever
enacted
standards
of
a
kind
that
are
suggested
here,
the
ones
that
a
model
penal
code
have
been
around
for
some
time
they
have
never
been
adopted
by
anybody.
this
discretionary
sentencing
in
capital
cases
has
been
with
us
just
like
as
i
pointed
out
earlier
was
at
the
instance
of
this
court
some
70
years
ago
that
the
federal
courts
commenced
this
procedure.
we’ve
known
about
it,
we
haven’t
been
offended
by
it.
i
think
the
results
have
been
by
enlarged,
a
vital
large
pretty
good
with
undoubtedly
they’re
always
arguable
cases
but
no
court
has
ever
held
that
this
is
a
constitutional
defect
in
sentencing.
only
two
years
ago,
this
court
agreed
to
adhere
to
the
decision
in
williams
against
new
york
which
in
evaluating
a
sentencing
procedures
in
new
york
in
a
capital
case
permitted
the
trial
judge
to
consider
matters
in
the
probation
report
and
other
sources
and
it
considered
things
that
have
not
been
testified
to
an
open
court
so
that
in
effect
the
defendant
had
no
right
to
cross-examine.
the
witnesses
that
--
and
the
information
sources
of
information
that
the
trial
judge
considered
and
in
that
case,
the
trial
judge
in
the
face
of
a
recommendation
of
a
life
sentence
by
the
jury
after
reviewing
these
matters
that
came
to
him
not
from
the
witness
stand
that
by
way
of
reports
imposed
the
death
sentence
in
his
good
judgment,
again
without
any
standards
as
far
as
i
can
tell
and
this
court
affirmed
it.
and
two
years
ago,
in
patterson
--
specht
against
patterson,
you
said,
you’ve
given
it
some
thought
that
you
adhered
to
that
decision
in
williams
against
new
york
and
it
seems
to
me
they
--
that
of
course
the
issues
are
different
in
this
case.
but
that
the
sentencing
procedure
in
arkansas
and
the
sentencing
procedure
in
california
and
in
the
federal
courts
and
everywhere
in
united
states
as
far
as
i
know
that
this
aspect
of
the
sentencing
procedure
does
comport
with
due
process
of
law
and
with
equal
protection
of
the
laws.
the
--
there
is
no
problem
here
in
my
judgment
of
undue
vagueness
in
the
law.
granted
there
are
no
standard
specifically
set
forth
but
the
definition
of
the
crimes
that
calls
for
capital
punishment,
everywhere
is
very
specific.
certainly,
it’s
in
arkansas
it
is
in
california
those
crimes
are
set
forth
whatever
they
might
be.
whether
in
the
first
degree,
rape,
however
the
legislature
wants
to
apply
it.
and
the
fact
that
the
defendant
doesn’t
know
and
indeed
no
one
knows
and
no
one
in
this
room
knows
whether
if
he
undertakes
a
murder
in
the
first
degree,
a
jury
will
ultimately
return
a
death
sentence
or
a
life
sentence
as
one
of
those
risks
that
he
has
to
take
in
this
life.
he
doesn’t
know
if
governor
will
grant
him
clemency.
he
doesn’t
know
if
the
district
attorney
and
whatever
county
happens
to
be
in
throughout
the
united
states
will
ask
for
a
death
sentence.
he
doesn’t
even
know
what
the
higher
courts
may
rule
in
some
things
that
might
happen
to
him
in
the
course
of
this
procedure.
of
course,
he
doesn’t
know
these
things.
but
he
knows
this
if
he
commits
a
murder
in
the
first
degree.
he
is
subject
to
the
death
penalty.
now
giving
the
jury
the
discretion
to
return
a
life
sentence
was
the
humanitarian
step
this
court
has
recognized
that
and
in
determining
guilt,
and
there
has
to
be
this
prior
determination
of
guilt
before
we
ever
get
around
this
sentencing.
the
defendant
has
the
benefit
of
all
of
the
constitutional
protections.
we
don’t
see
any
unfairness
in
this
situation.
we
don’t
see
any
uneven
application
of
the
law.
the
same
rule
is
applicable
to
everybody
that
goes
before
the
jury.
everybody
who
commits
a
murder
in
the
first
degree
or
rape
in
the
state
of
arkansas,
they
all
have
the
same
opportunity.
be
in
fact
they
even
have
--
they
have
a
better
opportunity
to
seek
a
life
sentence
under
the
discretionary
procedure
than
they
would
under
any
of
these
conceivable
standards.
here
the
whole
thing
is
wide
open.
anything
that
a
defense
attorney
can
conceive
of
to
say
that
might
persuade
a
juror,
mind
you
need
a
unanimous
verdict
in
this
cases.
think
of
its
one
juror
that
there
should
be
a
life
sentence
why
he’s
accomplished
the
purpose
and
the
only
bounds
are
his
own
imagination
and
his
own
ingenuity.
now
again
his
status
are
going
to
limit
that.
there
is
another
point
here
too,
i
think
and
i
forgot
to
mention
that
in
our
discussion
earlier
about
the
california
procedure
that
it
is
clear
in
california
that
you
--
the
trial
judge
can
on
requests
advice
the
jury
about
factors
that
they
might
consider
and
references
made
to
the
model
penal
code.
it
would
have
to
be
made
very
clear
to
the
jury
that
these
were
not
controlling
in
any
sense
but
if
that
were
done,
it
would
certainly,
i
think
the
jury
could
be
told
of
those
factors.
they
can
be
told
they
can
take
kindness
and
so
forth
into
account.
so
we
submit
that
the
mere
absence
of
standards
does
not
in
any
way
make
the
arkansas
procedure
for
that
reason
unconstitutional
if
there
other
objections
that
we
don’t
share
with
arkansas
in
terms
of
procedure,
i’m
sure
the
attorney
general
form
arkansas
was
prepared
to
deal
with
those.
i
have
just
one
closing
remark,
and
that
is
i
think
that
in
light
of
your
decision
in
witherspoon
wherein
you
recognize
that
under
illinois
law
the
conscience
of
the
community
was
focus
on
this
man
and
what
have
you
done.
and
there
was
no
guide
given
to
the
jury
and
you
insisted
that
that
jury
should
be
fairly
composed
and
that
was
undisputed
about
whether
that
one
was
but
nevertheless
it
would
have
to
be
fairly
composed
to
reflect
the
conscience
of
the
community.
that
rule
in
illinois,
in
the
absence
of
standards
is
essentially
the
same
thing.
you
have
to
face
an
arkansas
on
the
same
thing
that
we
have
in
california
and
it
seems
to
me
that
having
recognized
that
and
having
--
making
sure
as
you
have
made
sure
that
the
jury
must
be
a
fair
representation
of
the
community
because
you
are
invoke
in
their
conscience.
you're
invoking
their
--
the
qualities
as
i
have
referred
to
kindness,
compassion,
not
simply
an
arid
determination
of
facts
but
a
real
judgment
in
the
--
and
not
on
the
legal
sense
but
in
the
general
sense.
the
judgment
of
what
should
be
done
with
this
person.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
in
our
brief,
amicus
brief,
we
suggest
that
the
court
should
give
some
consideration
to
that
very
point.
the
case
was
tried
back
in
1962.
we
did
not
at
that
time
have
the
transcripts.
we
thought
it
was
probably
a
good
guess.
there
might
be
a
violation
of
it
--
of
the
witherspoon
rule.
in
the
meantime
and
in
fact
yesterday
morning
--
excuse
me.
i
examined
the
transcript.
it’s
right
here.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
pardon
me?
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
this
is
a
copy,
i
dont
know,
it
looks
like
the
original
to
me
but
here
it
is.
and
i
took
the
opportunity
to
go
over
it.
and
sure
enough
there
are
at
least
seven
jurors
about
in
this.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
it
hasn’t
been
raised
your
honor.
hasn’t
been
raised
apparently,
any
place.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well
you
came
down
--
handed
down
a
ruling
in
witherspoon
which
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
this
is
federal
habeas.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
i
think
you
could.
i
don’t
want
to
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
that’s
my
understanding.
that’s
the
sentence
of
death
is
being
attacked
and
not
the
conviction,
at
least
at
this
point.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
yes.
and
then
another
one
said,
“i
would
not
sentence
the
death
penalty.”
that
i
suppose
you
might
argue
meant
i
wouldn’t
in
any
case
but
it
wasn’t
spelled
out.
there’s
another
one
who
said,
“no
sir,
i
don’t
believe
in
capital
punishment”
and
went
off.
and
as
i
say
there
are
total
of
four
--
a
total
of
seven.
the
last
one
said,
“i
am
against
capital
punishment.”
i
suppose
there
could
be
argument
on
each
side
as
to
whether
or
not
this
complied
with
witherspoon
but
certainly
arguable
and
it
did
not.
we
think
you
could
reach
that.
we
think
that
issue
might
very
well
be
resolved
in
favor
of
the
petitioner
and
that
would
save
him
from
all
that
he
seeks
to
get
at
this
point
and
that
is
to
save
his
life.
having
that
issue,
there’s
no
need
that
you
go
into
this
other
question.
but
we
submit
that
if
you
do,
we
submit
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
of
course
you
don’t
have
the
transcript
before
you
now
but
i’m
sure
you
could
secure
it.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
it’s
not
part
of
the
appendix,
it’s
here.
it’s
on
the
table.
it’s
not
part
of
the
appendix.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
it’s
printed.
yes,
it
is.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
we
certainly
have
no
objection.
belongs
to
arkansas.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
my
time
that
we’ve
been
allotted
has
expired.
thank
you.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
interest
of
california
in
this
case
is
a
fairly
narrow
one,
in
terms
of
the
questions
that
were
--
or
the
issues
that
was
set
forth
by
mr.
amsterdam
at
the
start
of
his
argument.
we
are
not
concerned
about
the
single
verdict
procedure,
because
we
have
in
common
with
a
number
of
other
states,
a
bifurcated
trial,
and
we
have
separate
verdicts
for
both
guilt
and
a
verdict
for
the
penalty
in
capital
cases
only.
otherwise,
almost
all
sentencing
in
california
is
by
the
judge
and
usually
where
the
presentence
report
and
all
a
number
of
other
things.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
mr.
justice
black,
first
of
all
we
don't
have
a
different
jury.
it's
normally
the
same
jury.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
but
it's
a
different
trial.
it's
a
different
face
of
the
trial.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
i
don't
know
categorically,
your
honor.
i
think
mr.
amsterdam
said
about
eight
this
morning,
and
i
would
accept
that
as
an
accurate
statement.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
there
are
always
changes
in
california
law,
your
honor
but
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
no,
i
don't
believe
that
it
has,
at
least
nothing
connects
at
the
moment.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
no,
he
can
only
be
asked
the
same
questions
as
any
other
witness
could
be
asked.
he
could
be
asked
about
a
prior
felony,
and
so
far
as
that
would
impeach
his
credibility.
he
could
be
asked
about
questions
that
might
reflect
on
bias
and
so
forth,
but
he
couldn't
be
asked
generally
about
prior
misconduct.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
to
impeach
his
credibility,
any
witness
can
about
it,
with
a
prior
felony
conviction
in
california.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
no,
i
don't
think
he's
up
to
the
--
anywhere
near
the
same
difficulty.
he
doesn't
have
to
take
the
stand
in
the
guilt
phase,
of
course,
no
comment
can
be
made
on
if
he
doesn't.
he
can
take
the
stand
in
a
penalty
phase,
after
guilt
has
already
been
determine,
and
give
whatever
explanation
he
has.
by
the
same
token,
the
people
can
show
in
that
proceeding,
anything
in
his
history
a
background
that
in
their
judgment
reflects
adversely
on
it.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
that's
true
and
that's
true
and
that's
true
of
any
witness
who
might
be
called
by
anyone.
he's
subject
to
cross
examination,
and
his
credibility
has
to
be
assessed,
just
like
any
other
witness'
credibility.
but
we
don't
have
any
special
rules
as
to
criminal
defendants,
except
that
i
think
there's
more
of
a
tendency
to
limit
cross-examinations,
so
you
don't
get
beyond
the
scope
of
what
he
has
waived
by
taking
the
stand.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
that's
correct
your
honor,
the
state
can
prove
prior
crimes,
if
they
do,
they
have
to
prove
them
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
the
juries
so
instructed
and
things
of
that
nature.
now,
we
are
also
not
concern
with
the
witherspoon
question,
as
that
has
been
presented
here,
leaving
that
to
the
parties.
our
interest
in
this
case,
and
the
reason
we're
appearing
here
is
solely
on
the
question
of
whether
the
constitution
somehow
requires
the
juries
be
given
some
limiting
and
restricting
standards
in
deciding
on
the
question
of
whether
life
imprisonment
or
a
death
sentence
should
be
imposed
in
capital
cases.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor,
those
standards
of
course,
are
very
clear
and
specific
as
to
whether
or
not
there
is
a
murder
on
the
first
degree.
i
presume
a
rape
in
arkansas
or
whatever
the
crime
might
be.
these
would
be
standards,
and
really
limitations
and
restrictions
going
solely
to
the
question
of
penalty,
having
nothing
to
do
with
guilt,
that
having
been
determined
already
by
definition.
it's
done
formally
in
california,
in
arkansas
it
isn't
and
i
don't
want
to
enter
in
that
dispute.
i
would
like
to
clarify
one
point,
because
of
the
national
implications
that
were
made
clear
by
mr.
amsterdam,
and
that's
another
reason
why
we're
here.
in
california,
there
is
a
process,
by
which
the
judge
can
pass
in
his
discretion,
and
it's
the
same
kind
of
absolute
discretion
without
reference
to
any
formal
standards
that
the
jury
is
suppose
to
exercise.
one
there
has
been
a
death
penalty,
and
he
can
if
he
sees
fit
in
light
of
all
the
evidence,
all
of
the
factors
that
are
involved,
reduce
it
to
a
life
sentence,
and
there
it
is
forevermore
a
life
sentence.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
that
is
the
trial
judge.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
he
doesn't
have
to
give
any
reasons
and
probably
it's
better
if
he
didn't,
but
he
has
the
same
scope
of
discretion
that
the
jury
has,
that's
my
point,
there
is
judicial
review
at
the
trial
level.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
the
appellate
court
can
of
course,
find
for
example
the
evidence
isn't
sufficient
for
murder
in
the
first
degree,
and
so
it
make
it
murder
second.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
but
they
have
said,
although
it
was
–
justice
peters
of
the
court
takes
a
counter
review
that
they
will
not,
as
a
matter
of
discretion
and
judgment
reduce
a
death
sentence
to
a
life
sentence.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
that
very
commonly
occurred,
your
honor.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
pardon
me,
your
honor?
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
that's
correct,
you
have
a
different
jury
or
you
can
waive
a
jury
if
he's
so
inclined,
provided
the
people
way
of
his
wealth.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
no
one
can
question
the
judge,
in
terms
of
an
appeal
from
his
judgment,
that's
correct
your
honor.
now,
there
may
be
some
questions
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
no,
it's
a
--
i
think
there's
another
facet
of
the
situation
in
california,
as
well,
that
distinguishes
it
from
a
single
verdict
situation
and
meet
some
of
the
objections
that
have
been
raised
here,
and
that
is
the
objection
generally
that
--
what
the
jury
does
on
penalties
is
an
uninformed
judgment,
maybe
it's
arbitrary,
maybe
it's
even
discriminatory.
in
california
with
the
entire
procedure
is
such
that
evidence
can
be
introduced
by
both
sides
and
commonly
is,
but
it's
not
unusual
at
all.
a
psychiatric
evidence
can
be
introduced,
sociological
evidence,
anything
that
in
the
opinion
of
the
district
attorney
or
the
defense
attorney
might
carry
some
weight
with
jury
on
the
matter
of
penalty.
all
of
this
evidence
comes
in
and
the
only
restrictions
that
i'm
familiar
with
are
those
upon
the
prosecution,
which
cannot
show
certain
things.
for
example,
you
can't
prove
a
crime,
unless
you
can
prove
it
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
and
if
you
fail
on
that
burden
of
proof,
this
would
be
as
to
prior
crimes.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
yes,
you
could
do
that.
what
i
had
in
mind,
crimes
that
are
not
necessarily
been
reduced
to
a
conviction,
those
could
be
proven
too.
or
the
defendant
can
prove
his
good
record
or
whatever
he
thinks
may
be
in
his
behalf,
he
can
call
witnesses,
he
call
clergymen,
psychiatrist,
as
i
say,
and
a
like
(voice
overlap).
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
there
is
a
very
protracted,
a
very
commonly,
very
protracted
summing
up,
yes.
full
argument
on
both
sides,
and
that
at
that
point,
the
case
is
submitted
to
the
jury.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
the
instruction
is
based
basically
upon
the
statute
and
in
light
of
mr.
amsterdam's
remarks
this
morning
about
the
lack
of
legislative
determination
of
some
of
these
problems.
i
took
a
look
at
our
statute,
which
is
section
190.1
of
the
penal
code,
rather
long
section,
but
it
explains
in
a
good
deal
of
detail
and
nature
of
the
penalty
hearing,
what
kind
of
evidence
can
be
introduced,
and
what
the
jury
is
suppose
to
do.
now,
they're
not
left
in
the
dark
by
any
means.
it's
provided
specifically
that
evidence
may
be
produced
at
the
penalty
trial
of
the
circumstances
surrounding
the
crime,
of
the
defendant's
background
and
history,
and
of
any
facts
and
aggravation
or
mitigation
of
the
penalty.
the
determination
and
this
is
what
they
say
to
the
jury
and
to
the
judge,
this
is
what
our
legislature
is
so,
the
determination
of
the
penalty
of
life
imprisonment
or
death
shall
be
in
the
discretion
of
the
court
or
jury,
trying
the
issue
of
fact
on
the
evidence
presented.
and
the
penalty
fixed
shall
be
expressly
stated
in
the
decision
or
verdict.
now,
i
think
it's
clear
that
this
does
not
anticipate
any
kind
of
an
arbitrary
judgment
by
the
jury
or
the
judge.
and
he
is
to
make
the
--
he
or
the
juries
to
make
the
decision
on
the
evidence
presented.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
that's
essentially
--
you
may
consider
all
of
the
evidence
of
those
things
that
you've
just
mentioned,
your
honor.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
it's
phrased
in
terms
of
you
may
do
this
and
you
may
do
that,
but
basically
it's
the
statutory
language.
they're
also
told
this,
and
this
seems
to
be
the
heart
of
the
petitioner's
compliant.
however,
it
is
not
essential
to
your
decision
that
you
find
mitigating
circumstances
on
the
one
hand
or
evidence
in
aggravation
of
the
offense
on
the
other.
and
this
of
course,
is
the
more
or
less
the
--
represents
the
historical
process
that
was
discussed
this
morning.
they're
also
told
this,
and
i
think
this
excludes
arbitrariness,
and
i
think
it
excludes
any
of
the
things
that
we
heard
this
morning.
notwithstanding
facts
if
any
proved
in
mitigation
or
aggravation.
in
determining
which
punishment
shall
be
inflicted,
you
are
entirely
free
to
act
according
to
you
own
judgment,
conscience,
and
absolute
discretion.
that
verdict
must
express
the
individual
opinion
of
each
juror.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
i
think
that's
true
mr.
justice
harlan,
and
i
think
perhaps
we've
too
readily
accept
that
the
working
proposition
with
the
purposes
of
argument
that
there
are
no
standards.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
that
is
--
those
are
two
words,
“absolute
discretion.”
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
it's
a
standard,
as
standards
have
developed
in
this
kind
of
--
this
(voice
overlap).
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
certainly
not,
i
can't
imagine
anymore
specific
statement
of
the
legislative
intent,
and
its
clear
recognition
of
the
problem.
now,
it
may
not
be
the
best
solution,
it
may
be
better,
it
may
be
more
logical,
and
it
may
be
you've
added
symmetry
to
the
law
to
say,
you
have
to
have
mandatory
death
standards.
it
may
be
that
the
–
or
standards
for
mandatory
death
sentences,
it
may
be
the
constitution
requires
that
this
court
move
back
70
or
100
years,
i
suppose,
and
say
well
you
have
a
death
sentence
that
has
to
be
a
mandatory
sentence
with
no
discretion.
i
find
that
hard
to
believe.
the
decision
of
this
court
over
70
years
ago
in
winston
against
the
united
states,
today
i
think
as
well
as
any
other
--
anything
i've
ever
read
sums
up
the
kind
of
considerations
that
i
think
any
of
us
would
agree,
should
be
considered
by
a
jury.
and
i'm
not
talking
about
impermissible
considerations,
but
you'll
recall
in
winston,
the
court,
this
court
rejected
a
standard
and
held
that
a
standard
should
not
be
implied,
that
death
should
be
returned
in
the
absence
of
mitigating
circumstances.
now,
that's
a
standard
of
sorts,
perhaps
not
a
very
specific
one,
but
it
is
a
standard.
this
court
held
that
that
did
not
express
the
intent
of
congress,
as
manifest
in
the
legislation.
but
in
discussing
this,
the
court
pointed
to
some
of
the
things
that
they
thought
should
be
considered,
and
would
seem
to
me
they
should
be
considered
today.
they
said,
how
far
considerations
of
age,
sex,
ignorance,
illness,
or
intoxication
of
human
passion
or
weakness,
of
sympathy
or
clemency,
or
the
irrevocableness
of
an
executed
sentence
of
death
or
an
apprehension
that
explanatory
facts
may
exists,
which
have
not
been
brought
to
light
or
any
other
consideration
or
whatever,
should
be
allowed
to
wait
in
deciding
the
question
whether
the
accused
should
or
should
not
be
capitally
punished
as
committed
by
the
act
of
congress
to
the
sound
discretion
of
the
jury
and
of
the
jury
alone.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
it's
certainly
a
discussion
of
the
factors,
a
statement
listing
of
the
factors
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
yes
it
does,
your
honor,
we've
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
yes,
we
quoted
that.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
that's
right,
and
we
think
in
doing
that,
and
the
legislature
in
setting
up
the
structure
before
doing
that
is
not
required
to
limit
or
restrict
the
discretion
of
the
jury
in
anyway.
that
essentially
what
standard
means
in
this
context,
i
think.
certainly,
it
doesn't
mean
that
anyone
can
be
taken
off
the
street
and
because
the
jury
doesn't
like
him
executed.
the
ball
of
question
arises
only
after
a
conviction
of
a
capital
offense
and
as
to
that
the
standards
are
very
strict.
historically,
it's
clear
that
the
motivation
here
was
to
permit
juries
to
draw
distinctions
in
terms
of
humane
and
emotional
considerations,
and
i
think
the
thought
in
the
minds
of
legislatures,
that
we
can't
list
everything
that
might
be
material.
we
cannot
anticipate
everything
and
we
don't
want
to
limit
the
discretion
of
the
jurors.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
that's
the
standard,
pardon
me.
in
death,
in
capital
cases?
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
it's
up
to
the
defendant
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
he
has
the
right
to
a
jury,
if
he
waives
it
we
permit
sentencing
by
the
judge.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
none,
except
those
that
i
have
alluded
to
and
supplied
to
the
jury.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
in
a
capital
case,
i
don't
think
a
capital
case
would
be
handled
exactly
that
way.
i
think
you
would
a
more
formal
proceeding,
that
simply
presentence
report.
it
would
certainly
be
appropriate.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
i
believe
that's
true,
yes
sir,
it
would
be
--
that's
not
uncommon
to
have
a
trial
before
the
judge
on
this
issue
of
penalty,
with
the
same
evidence,
with
the
same
considerations
in
mind.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
exactly,
and
that
happens
not
infrequently.
and
this
--
it
seems
to
be
underlying,
this
whole
argument
of
the
petitioner
here,
the
notion
that
unless
there
is
uniform
treatment
handed
out
in
convicted
criminals,
that
there
has
been
some
violation
of
some
provision
of
the
constitution.
now,
if
there's
one
thing
that's
clear
over
the
last
half
century,
it
is
--
and
this
court
expressed
very
clearly
and
noted
with
approval,
the
practice
of
fitting
the
punishment
not
to
the
crime,
but
to
the
offender.
and
it's
not
uncommon
to
have
a
whole
variety
of
penalties
handed
out
to
a
number
of
people,
who
have
committed
precisely
the
same
crime,
because
you
look
to
their
background,
you
look
to
their
role
in
the
crime,
you
look
to
the
nature
of
what
each
of
those
persons
did.
and
the
court
has
found
nothing
of
constitutional
dimensions
in
any
way
to
bar
this
kind
of
procedure.
now,
we
think
that
the
leaving
to
the
jury,
the
opportunity
to
extend
mercy
to
a
man
who
is
convicted
of
a
crime,
potentially
involved
in
a
capital
punishment,
is
simply
an
application
of
fitting
the
punishment
to
the
offender
and
not
to
the
crime.
now,
there's
nothing
--
not
only
is
there
nothing
wrong
with
that,
we
think
that's
a
--
and
i
think
there's
general
agreement
among
people
who
know
about
these
things
that
this
what
science
has
taught
us,
this
is
what
everything
we've
learned
has
taught
us.
and
the
capital
sentencing
is
very
typical
of
other
sentencing
in
that
respect
in
fitting
the
punishment
to
the
offender.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
that's
true
your
honor,
but
these
are
standards,
and
as
i
understand
it,
we're
mitigating
circumstances
are
listed
as
in
the
model
penal
code,
that
is
it,
if
you
don't
come
under
one
of
those,
there's
no
way
you
can
go
to
the
jury
and
say
this
poor
man
should
have
his
life
spared,
because
he
was
good
to
his
mother
or
something
like
and
we
can
do
that
in
california.
the
only
limitation
on
the
defense
in
california
is
the
ingenuity
and
the
resourcefulness
of
the
defense.
if
he
think
of
something
that
might
appeal
to
one
person
on
the
jury,
which
is
really
all
you
need
because
you
need
unanimous
jury.
he's
free
to
urge
it,
and
we
see
nothing
wrong
with
that,
and
we
don't
see
anything
that
necessarily
or
even
logically
would
result
in
arbitrariness.
we
think
it's
fair,
and
has
worked
pretty
well
over
the
years.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
there
are
alternative
provisions,
if
the
jury
disagrees,
the
judge
can
either
impanel
a
jury
or
he
can
take
the
case
and
give
him
a
life
sentence.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
that
judge
can.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
no,
he
can't
do
anymore
than
that.
now,
i
think
if
look
a
little
--
and
i
think
we
have
to
look
at
what
is
it
that
the
states
should
do,
and
what
should
the
federal
government
do,
if
what
we
do
now
is
wrong,
in
terms
of
standards.
and
i'm
not
talking
about
the
single
verdict,
but
in
terms
of
standards,
if
what
we're
doing
now
is
wrong,
what
is
it
that
we
should
do?
now,
this
is
something
that
was
covered
in
witherspoon
very
carefully.
at
least
in
noting
what
was
not
forbidden
in
witherspoon,
and
giving
the
states
guidelines
as
to
what
to
do
with
these
cases
when
they
came
back.
now
in
listening
to
the
argument
today
and
in
the
reading
the
briefs,
i
haven't
seen
anything
that's
specifically
points
to
the
what
the
states
could
do
to
meet
the
standards
that
the
petitioners
submit
have
to
be
established.
they
say
if
you
look
at
the
model
penal
code,
you'll
find
one
you've
limited
defendants,
there
are
things
they
can't
urge.
and
i
don't
think
the
people
want
that
situation.
even
under
the
model
penal
code
you
get
down
to
formulations
like
this,
it's
easy
to
talk
about
standards,
but
what
is
the
final
formulation
to
a
jury
under
the
model
penal
code.
well,
if
found
an
aggravating
circumstance,
which
could
be
--
for
example
he
killed
more
than
one
person
or
he
committed
a
felony
in
certain
kinds
and
in
connecting
with
the
killing.
if
you
find
an
aggravating
circumstance,
you
may
return
a
death
a
sentence,
you
don't
have
to,
you
may,
but
then
you
have
to
determine
whether
the
mitigating
circumstances
are
not
sufficiently
substantial
to
call
for
leniency.
now,
what's
the
jury's
told,
that's
the
instruction.
and
that
would
be
my
guess
that
a
jury
would
go
back
and
talk
about
these
mitigating
circumstances,
and
come
back
with
a
judge,
and
say
well
you
told
us
what
we
could
consider.
but
how
do
we
weigh
each
of
these
items,
and
how
we
determine
when
a
particular
circumstance
is
sufficiently
substantial
to
call
for
leniency.
and
i
think
the
judge
would
have
to
say,
“well,
you
use
your
discretion,
that's
what
then
your
sound
discretion.”
so,
where
are
you
except
that
you
have
limited
the
defendant,
and
you
set
up
a
kind
of
an
artificial
and
a
structure
that
meets
what
the
petitioners
think
all
statutes
should
consist
of
and
you
ignored
the
experience
of
all
the
states
that
have
the
death
sentence,
and
the
united
states
government,
and
for
what
end.
i
think
as
the
end
would
be
a
jury,
still
left
with
having
to
come
to
that
fundamental
decision.
is
this
man
going
to
die
or
is
he
going
to
live,
and
bare
in
mind
that
it's
a
man
who
has
committed
a
capital
offense
and
has
been
found
guilty.
it's
not
someone
off
the
street.
and
one
thing
that
has
been
emphasized
in
california,
and
there
are
number
of
cases
that
repeat
this
theme,
and
it
runs
through
all
of
the
death
penalty
cases.
we
have
many,
many
cases
that
deal
only
with
penalty
procedures,
many
appellate
decisions.
and
we've
had
countless
retrials,
solely
on
penalty,
but
a
theme
that
runs
through
all
of
those
decisions
is
this,
you've
got
to
convince
the
juror
that
it's
his
individual
responsibility
for
that
verdict.
when
he
goes
out
of
that
courtroom
or
he
comes
back
with
a
verdict,
it's
his
decision
that
this
man
should
die.
he
cannot
leave
the
decision
in
someone
else's
hand.
you
can't
tell
him
the
governor
may
grant
clemency,
because
he's
not
supposed
to
think
about
such
things.
if
he
mentions
anything
about
parole,
he's
not
supposed
to
worry
about
the
parole
board
making
a
mistake.
it
has
to
be
his
individual
decision,
and
anything
that
has
impeached
that
individual
decision
has
been
held
bad
in
california.
now,
i
think
this
is
the
--
the
best
way
to
administer
this
system
if
the
death
penalty
is
to
continue
and
its
validity
asset
is
not
an
issue
in
this
case.
if
it's
going
to
continue,
and
if
you're
going
to
conclude
that
not
every
member,
not
every
person
who
commits
murder
one,
should
be
executed.
then,
i
think
that
the
--
what
we
do
is
the
fairest
and
the
most
rational,
if
i
may
use
that
word,
way
of
concluding
who
should
be
executed
that
i
have
heard
about.
and
i
think
it's
far
preferable
to
the
model
penal
code,
and
i
certainly
think
the
legislature
would
reject
notions
of
mandatory
death
sentences,
in
light
of
our
whole
experience.
emphasizing
this
individual
responsibility,
i
think
gives
the
defendant
the
fair
shake,
and
emphasizing
to
the
jury
that
they
have
to
consider
the
evidence,
that
they
have
to
consider
things
that
are
produced
in
court,
excludes,
i
think
the
possibility
of
any
of
the
arbitrariness
that's
been
mentioned
here,
earlier.
i
have
no
doubt
that
a
jury
in
california
can't
point
to
any
decision,
but
i
have
no
doubt
that
if
a
defendant
thought
that
racial
prejudice,
status,
class,
position,
or
anything
of
that
sort
might
possibly
influence
any
single
juror
that
he
could
ask
the
judge
to
please
instruct
them
to
get
such
things
out
of
their
minds.
i
don't
think
those
--
it's
very
unlikely
that
that
would
enter
the
minds
of
the
jurors,
but
if
there
were
any
possibility,
that
could
certainly
be
excluded.
they
wouldn't
have
anymore
of
a
standard,
but
should
be
telling
you,
you
can't
rely
on
these
things.
that
could
be
done,
whether
it
could
be
done
in
arkansas,
i
don't
know,
probably
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
i
think
mr.
amsterdam
gave
the
figure
of
85
to
90,
which
about
thelast
i
heard.
i
could
get
the
precise
figure
for
you,
your
honor.
but
it's
in
that
dimension.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
yes
sir,
it
does.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
i
don't
know
about
the
statistics
over
time
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
accumulation
at
the
moment
is
due
to
the
stays
over
the
last
eight
years.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
yes,
they
have.
i
think
the
last
figure
for
jury
verdicts
of
death
that
i
saw
was
around
20.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
in
terms
of
numbers,
i
don't
mr.
justice
black.
i
have
no
information
on
that
as
far
as
the
number.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
certainly.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
i
can
certainly
try
to
and
if
i
can
get
it
out,
i'd
be
glad
to
supply
the
court.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
i
think
that's
the
last
figure
i
saw.
we
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
oh!
these
go
back,
my
gosh!
they
go
back
ten
years.
i
mean
for
one
year,
there
were
some
20
(voice
overlap).
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
in
a
single
year.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
and
the
80
or
the
90
or
whatever
it
is
goes
--
i
know
of
some
that
go
back
at
least
ten
years.
so,
i
think
that's
a
typical
of
the
situation
arising
from
stays.
and
i
think
the
submission
of
the
petitioner
here
that
this
court
should,
as
far
as
the
standards
issue
goes,
as
i
understood
mr.
amsterdam
this
morning,
in
effect
or
it
says
it
directly,
set
aside
505
approximately
death
sentences
imposed
throughout
the
united
states.
for
some
defect,
that
it
is
also
submitted
cannot
be
corrected
at
least
in
terms
of
anything
that
we've
been
able
to
discuss
here
today
and
anything
that
you
could
tell
to
the
states
and
to
the
congress
of
the
united
states,
in
terms
of
this
is
what
you
should
do,
instead
of
what
you've
done.
i
think
this
would
be
a
very
unfortunate
situation.
and
what
the
inability
to
articulate
standards,
i
think
doesn't
show
a
lack
of
resourcefulness,
but
it
shows
us
of
the
equalities
that
are
involved
here
and
the
problems
that
are
involved
here
are
just
such
that
we
cannot
reduce
the
problem
to
specific
factors
and
way
each
any
arbitrary
manner.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
i
think
you
have
to
--
well,
you
would
have
to
redefine
the
crime
and
say
in
effect
will
only
allow
the
death
penalty
in
a
smaller
class
of
cases.
as
your
honor
said,
in
certain
kinds
of
rape
or
by
the
same
token
in
murder,
and
there's
been
no
suggestion
here
that
state
of
california
has
gone
too
far
in
defining
first-degree
murder
or
brought
in
cases
that
constitutionally
can't
be
brought
in.
and
as
i
understand
the
argument,
there
would
be
no
objection
whatever,
as
far
as
this
argument
goes,
if
the
state
of
california
said
humane
considerations
don't
concern
us,
we'll
impose
a
death
penalty
straight
out,
as
to
every
man
convicted
of
murder
in
the
first
degree.
and
i
can't
believe
that
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
requires
that
the
people
of
california
take
that
view,
which
100
years
ago
might
have
been
acceptable,
but
it's
not
acceptable
today,
simply
for
these
artificial
reasons.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
i
don't
think
you
can
mr.
justice
black,
and
meet
the
needs
of
the
society
and
anticipate
giving
the
defendant
every
opportunity
to
show
that
his
life
should
be
spared.
and
i
don't
see
how
you
can
put
qualities,
as
i
mentioned
a
year
ago
of
mercy
and
compassion
in
a
scale
of
standards.
and
assign
some
arbitrary
weight
or
even
if
you
please
define
what
mercy
or
compassion
mean.
and
i
don't
think
that
judges
are
anymore
capable
of
extending
mercy
than
the
citizens
on
a
jury.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
no,
it
plays
no
role
whatever
in
the
death
sentencing,
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
oh!
i'm
sure
there
is,
there's
debate
about
everything.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
no,
i'm
not,
i
think
a
bill
has
been
introduced,
one
always
is,
i
don't
think
it
is
really
a
major
public
issue
at
the
moment.
thank
you.
