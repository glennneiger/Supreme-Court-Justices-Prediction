justice
potter
stewart
you,
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
fortas’
initial
question
in
this
series
about
distinguishing
a
capital
sentence
from
an
ordinary
sentence
and
you
said
there
were
three
distinctions
you
got
as
far
as
to
the
skinner
against
oklahoma
distinction
and
the
absence
of
any
therapeutic
possible
arguable
therapeutic
purpose
and
a
capital
sentence
follows
the
third.
justice
potter
stewart
is
the
trial
transcript,
i
think
i
saw
somewhere
in
the
briefs
that
this,
the
trial
transcript
was
available
in
the
united
states
district
court
and
the
federal
court
of
appeals.
justice
potter
stewart
as
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
remember
a
case
that
came
here
from
ohio
back
in
the
1920s
in
which
i
remember
it
because
my
father
was
counsel
for
the
petitioner
of
the
case
when
i
was
a
little
boy
in
which
ohio
which
has
somewhat
similar
system
to
arkansas
but
this
was
for
first-degree
murder
had
not
allowed
the
counsel
for
the
defendant
to
even
argue
to
the
jury
that
they
should
extend
or
recommend
mercy
as
that
states
has
and
that
decision
was
either
affirmed
or
certiorari
was
denied
here.
i’ve
forgotten
which
but
i
wondered
if
in
the
case
law
of
arkansas
if
some
of
the
standards
have
not
been
evolved
in
deciding
what
is
permissible
to
be
argued
to
the
jury
with
respect
to
the
imposition
of
penalty
in
the
capital
case.
justice
potter
stewart
so
far
as
it
appears,
they
can
argue
anything?
they
could
argue
anything
i
suppose.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
amsterdam,
may
i
ask
why
the
five,
were
they
convicted
in
the
state
that
does
have
juries
instructed
with
standards
or
what?
justice
potter
stewart
where
the
jury
doesn't
have
any
discretion?
justice
potter
stewart
i
see,
i
see,
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
and
before
that
mr.
amsterdam?
justice
potter
stewart
mandatory
death
sentence?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
typically
is
historically
the
fact
in
most
these
states,
is
it
not
that
they
--
states
move
from
a
mandatory
death
sentence,
upon
conviction
of
first-degree
murder
or
in
this
case
a
rape
move
from
a
mandatory
death
sentence,
upon
conviction
to
giving
the
jury
discretion
to
avert
that
death
sentence
in
their
verdict.
isn't
that
historically
the
way
that
this
develop
in
most
states?
justice
potter
stewart
and
in
some
states,
it
takes
affirmative
action
of
the
jury
to
avert
the
death
penalty.
in
some
states,
it
takes
an
affirmative
action
of
the
jury
nowadays
to
impose
a
death
penalty.
and
some
states
it's
verbalized
in
terms
as
in
my
state
of
ohio,
it's
verbalize
in
terms
of
jury
recommendation
of
mercy,
but
the
jury
is
instructed
by
the
judge,
what
the
effect
of
that
so-called
recommendation
of
mercy
will
be,
it
will
be
to
convert
death
sentence
in
those
sentence
of
life
imprisonment,
and
so
on.
but
basically,
the
historical
pattern
is
as
i
described
it,
is
it
not
of
a
development
of
--?
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
a
question
that's
already
been
more
or
less
decided
in
the
witherspoon
case.
you'd
have
that
issue
in
jury
selection,
but
you
wouldn't
have
either
of
your
basic
arguments
if
arkansas
law
was
the
way
it
used
to
be
before
the
turn
of
the
century.
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
precisely,
then
you
wouldn't
have
any
statute
for
the
jury
to
follow.
justice
potter
stewart
i'd
understood
that
was
a
dead
letter
in
that
statute.
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
my
understanding
from
the
last
argument.
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
any
cautionary
instruction?
justice
potter
stewart
even
it
would
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
it's
just
not
limited
then
to
prior
convictions
of
crime,
but
any
acts
of
misconduct
all
his
life?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
mean
may
a
prosecutor
exist
without
knowledge
of
any
actual
acts
misconduct,
employ
a
form
of
examination
to
enlist
it?
did
you
ever
get
into
trouble
before,
that
you
ever
get
the
trouble
in
school,
all
that
sort
of
thing?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
the
trial
judge?
justice
potter
stewart
in
his
discretion
without
giving
any
reasons
of
any
kind.
justice
potter
stewart
but
what
they
often
do,
in
my
observation,
perhaps
i'm
dreaming,
is
to
affirm
the
conviction
that
set
aside
the
death
sentence
imposed
in
the
penalty
phase
of
the
trial,
because
of
error
occurring
in
that
phase
of
the
trial.
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
so.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it's
certainly
just
the
--
you
could
--
couldn't
you
just
do
some
documentary
evidence
of
a
conviction?
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
a
summing
up
to
the
jury
by
counsel
for
each
side
after
the
evidence
on
this
penalty
thing?
justice
potter
stewart
under
what
kind
of
instructions?
justice
potter
stewart
i
asked
too,
what
sort
of
instruction
is
there
are
given
to
the
jury?
does
that
judge
normally
just
quote
the
statutory
language
that
you
read
to
us
in
reaching
the
decision,
ladies
and
gentlemen
of
the
jury,
you
should
consider
the
circumstances
of
the
crime,
the
defendant's
background
and
history,
any
other
facts
or
circumstances
that
may
–
whatever
you
read
to
us,
does
he
say
that?
justice
potter
stewart
i'm
just
trying
to
remember
what
you
read
to
us,
but
i
--
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
determination
of
what
the
legislature
in
california
wants
a
jury
to
consider
in
this
penalty
phase
of
the
trial,
is
it
not?
to
consider
those
–
that
statutory
language,
but
ultimately
in
the
end
saying,
it's
entirely
up
to
your
discretion.
at
least,
that's
a
clear
expression
of
the
legislature
that
was
their
intent.
it
wasn't
done
--
we
don't
have
a
situation
that's
been
created
by
inadvertence,
do
you?
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
judge
would
--
if
he
waives
the
jury
trial
of
the
sentence,
part
of
it,
why
the
judge
would
just
try
that
on
the
same
evidence,
and
the
jury
would
hear
it.
