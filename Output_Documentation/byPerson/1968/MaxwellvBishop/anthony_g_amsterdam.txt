mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
federal
habeas
corpus
proceeding
on
behalf
of
william
maxwell.
it
condemned
challenging
the
sentence
of
death
imposed
upon
him
by
an
arkansas
jury.
unlike
the
boykin
case
which
the
court
has
just
heard.
no
question
is
presented
here
with
regard
to
the
ultimate
power
of
the
state
of
arkansas
to
use
death
as
a
penalty
for
crime.
even
for
the
crime
of
rape
of
which
william
maxwell
was
convicted.
the
questions
presented
relate
entirely
to
the
procedures
by
which
the
death
penalty
is
administered
in
the
state
of
arkansas
and
by
which
out
of
the
total
number
of
persons
convicted
of
the
crime
of
rape,
some
are
selected
to
live
and
others
are
selected
to
die.
we
have
two
federal
constitutional
claims
against
the
arkansas
procedure
which
for
short
reference
i
may
term
the
standards
claim
and
the
single
verdict
claim.
in
order
to
put
this
into
prospective
and
to
show
their
relationship
because
i
think
they
are
eminently
related.
i
would
like
to
take
a
hard
look
at
the
outset
if
i
may
at
the
procedure
by
which
arkansas
does
determine
case
by
case
and
individual
cases
whether
persons
convicted
of
rape
shall
live
or
shall
go
to
their
death
in
the
electric
chair.
now
under
arkansas
law,
there
is
one
statutory
provision
which
provides
that
the
punishment
for
the
crime
of
rape
is
death.
in
other
statute,
in
effect
since
1915
provides
that
in
any
case
in
which
the
punishment
is
death
by
law,
the
jury
may
return
instead
a
verdict
of
imprisonment
for
life
in
state
penitentiary.
the
effect
of
these
two
statutes
therefore
is
to
create
an
authorization.
the
availability
of
returning
the
death
penalty
in
a
broad
range
of
cases
but
to
require
the
death
penalty
and
not
thereby
both
supposing
that
selection
is
possible
among
the
total
number
of
persons
convicted
of
rape
and
requiring
that
selection
must
in
fact
be
made
among
the
total
number
of
persons
convicted
of
rape
of
some
smaller
number
who
shall
suffer
death,
the
extreme
penalty
for
that
crime.
now,
it’s
not
surprising
that
such
a
selective
process
is
set
in
motion
by
arkansas
law
because
the
crime
of
rape
is
in
arkansas
as
elsewhere.
a
crime
that
includes
a
wide
range
of
factual
situations,
it
is
simply
any
consummated
sexual
assault.
it
can
be
committed
against
a
mature
woman,
against
a
child,
with
a
weapon
endangering
life,
or
not
endangering
life.
the
victim
can
be
permanently,
physically
injured
or
not
permanently
physically
injured.
tremendous
range
of
factual
situations
involved
any
large
range
of
offenders
and
in
fact
on
this
record
one
can
say
that
only
about
a
quarter,
25
out
of
a
100
of
the
persons
actually
convicted
of
rape
get
to
death
sentence.
now,
i
put
the
focus
here
at
the
beginning
to
point
out
what
i
--
where
i
think
the
focus
has
to
be
in
this
case.
on
the
process
by
which
that
selective
judgment
is
made,
this
is
not
an
insignificant
or
non-important
process.
it
is
literally
vital
but
it
is
also
vital
and
legal
sense
because
the
law
of
arkansas
as
to
whether
rape
is
or
is
not
a
capital
offense
is
in
fact
being
made
case
by
case
as
in
each
individual
adjudication
the
determination
is
made
whether
the
defendant
lives
or
dies.
it
is
a
law
making
process
the
penalty
for
rape
in
arkansas
is
not
death.
it
is
subjection
to
this
decisional
process
and
the
question
which
this
case
presents
is
whether
the
specific
procedure
here
is
in
arkansas.
to
make
that
decision,
comport
with
the
constitution.
now,
how
is
the
decision
in
fact
made.
it
is
made
in
each
case
by
a
jury.
a
jury
cannot
be
waived
in
a
death
case
in
arkansas.
if
as
petitioner
maxwell
did,
the
defending
contest
guilt
if
the
intensity
is
innocent,
a
jury
is
in
impaneled
to
decide
two
distinct
questions
whether
he
is
guilty
of
the
crime
of
rape
and
if
so,
what
punishment
shall
be
imposed
upon
it.
as
to
the
first
of
these
two
decisions
whether
or
not
the
defendant
is
guilty
of
rape,
the
jury
is
guided
as
it
is
in
any
criminal
case
by
the
law
defining
the
crime
of
rape
and
the
trial
in
the
capital
case
in
arkansas
is
not
unusual
in
this
regard.
the
jury
can’t
convict
the
defendant
simply
because
they
don’t
like
him
or
because
he’s
unpleasant
or
because
they
don’t
like
the
color
or
his
skin
or
for
any
other
reason.
it
can
convict
him
only
if
they
find
each
element
of
the
offense
established
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
on
the
record.
the
definition
of
the
crime
of
rape
gives
the
jury
something
to
talk
about.
when
they
go
back
to
decide
the
case,
they
talk
with
each
other
about
what
is
the
elements
of
the
offense
they’re
made
out
and
the
rule
of
law
that
is
being
applied
by
the
jury
to
decide
the
guilt
question
and
only
the
guilt
question
is
the
same
rule
of
law.
it
applies
to
every
other
person
in
arkansas
as
previously
been
tried
for
rape
or
will
be.
when
we
get
to
the
penalty
question,
on
the
other
hand,
we
are
in
a
different
world
because
on
the
penalty
question
the
jury
is
given
no
instructions.
the
jury
is
given
no
principles
to
guide
its
decisions.
the
ordinary
procedure
in
arkansas
is
simply
to
give
the
jury
two
forms,
a
death
form
which
rates
we
find
the
defending
guilty
as
charge
and
a
life
form
which
says
we
find
the
defendant
guilty
as
charge
and
sentence
him
to
imprisonment
for
life.
no
instructions
are
given.
the
jury
is
simply
told,
take
your
choice.
now,
we
have
characterized
that
process
of
decision
making
in
our
brief
not
in
the
constitutional
sense
or
simply
a
descriptive
sense
as
arbitrary.
and
i
might
rest
on
that
because
neither
california
nor
arkansas
in
response
as
coupled
with
that
question
only
they
defend
the
process
of
sentencing
as
i
understand
it
on
the
ground
that
it
constitutes
a
beneficent
arbitrariness.
but
i
think
it
is
helpful
to
examine
in
somewhat
more
detail
exactly
what
is
entailed
in
what
i
call
an
arbitrary
process.
the
jury
is
given
in
making
its
determination
of
life
or
death
a
choice
which
it
may
make
without
any
prerequisite
findings
of
fact.
that
is
to
say
the
ordinary
procedures
that
we
all
know
as
lawyers,
it
ordinarily
go
on
in
courts
of
law.
where
a
judge
says
to
a
jury
if
you
find
“x”
then
the
result
would
be
“y.”
simply
it
doesn’t
apply.
there
are
no
required
findings
of
fact.
the
jury
need
not
find
that
the
defendant
use
the
weapon
or
permanently
injured
the
victim
or
that
he
had
a
prior
record
or
any
such
thing.
any
and
every
offense
of
rape
may
be
punished
by
death
nor
required
findings
of
fact.
not
only
are
there
no
specific
required
findings
of
fact
in
the
nature
of
aggravating
circumstances
in
that
sort
of
thing.
there
are
no
general
findings
of
fact
put
to
the
jury.
the
question
is
not
asked
would
society
be
safe
if
this
man
were
incarcerated
in
the
penitentiary
for
life.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
resume
a
brief
description
of
the
exact
nature
of
the
discretion
that
the
arkansas
jury
has
in
capital
sentencing.
as
i
have
said,
there
are
no
prerequisite
factual
findings
to
return
a
death
verdict.
the
jury
may
need
to
find
nothing
specific
in
aggravation.
of
the
sort
that
for
example
the
european
codes
used
that
the
offense
was
committed
with
the
weapon
or
that
the
defendant
had
a
prior
conviction
of
a
similar
offense
or
any
such
thing.
there
are
--
is
no
general
required
finding
of
fact
such
as
that
the
defendant
is
unreformable
or
recidivist
or
incurable
or
any
such
thing.
there
are
no
preclusive
findings
of
fact
that
is
findings
which
will
exclude
the
death
penalty.
the
jury
is
not
told
if
you
find
that
the
defendant
was
suffering
a
mental
disease
or
defect
which
rendered
him
unstable
or
that
the
defendant
has
no
prior
record
or
that
the
victim
did
not
use
a
great
degree
of
force
and
resistance
or
that
the
defendant
did
not
use
the
weapon
you
may
not
sentence
to
death.
and
there
are
similarly
no
general
preclusive
findings
of
the
nature
of
emotional
disorder
or
any
such
thing.
there
is
no
direction
to
the
jury
that
it
shall
take
consideration
of
any
particular
range
or
realm
of
fact.
the
jury
is
not
told
in
deciding
whether
the
sentence
to
defend
into
life
or
death
you
shall
take
into
account
whether
the
defendant
used
the
weapon
or
whether
the
victim
was
previously
chased
or
the
character
of
the
defendant
or
any
of
those
things.
there’s
not
even
an
authorization
which
would
direct
their
attention
to
some
things
you
may
take
account
of
such
and
such
and
the
jury
is
not
told
that
there
are
things
they
may
not
take
account
of.
you
may
not
take
account
of
race.
you
may
not
take
account
of
anything
that
the
legislature
thinks
irrelevant
to
its
purposes
in
enacting
the
death
penalty.
there
are
no
principles
for
judgments.
no
standards
for
judgments
given
to
the
jury
at
all.
not
even
a
kind
of
vague
standard
that
is
the
minimum
we
use
in
any
kind
of
other
judicial
proceedings
such
as
reasonable
man.
it’s
sometimes
easy
to
forget
how
much
the
reasonable
man
standard
does
direct
the
jury
in
a
civil
damage
case.
at
least
the
jury
knows
that
the
defendant’s
obligation
is
to
exercise
reasonable
care,
the
care
that
the
reasonable
man
would
exercise
toward
the
plaintiff.
our
whole
law
assumes
that
that
has
significance.
it’s
different
from
the
duty
the
defendant
owes
to
a
trespasser
to
exercise
somewhat
less
care
that
he
might
owe
to
someone
who
he
has
special
duty
to
care
for.
the
jury
in
the
civil
case
isn’t
told
that
they
may
return
a
verdict
against
the
defendant
if
they
don’t
like
him
or
if
there’s
something
offensive
about
him
or
any
such
thing.
the
issue
is
framed.
he
owes
a
duty
of
care.
how
much
care?
the
care
that
a
reasonable
man
would
exercise.
there’s
no
such
thing
in
the
capital
sentencing
discretion.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
is
your
asking
of
capital
sentencing
or
regular
sentencing?
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
in
capital
sentencing,
ordinarily
there
are
no
greater
standards
given.
in
non-capital
sentencing,
there
may
or
not
be
but
even
if
there
are
no
standards
given,
explicitly
by
statute,
the
kind
of
discretion
he
exercises
is
very
different
than
that
which
a
jury
exercises
in
sentencing
to
death
for
a
number
of
reasons.
one
is
that
the
judges
are
professional
sentencer
and
although
we
certainly
make
no
attack
on
the
jury
system
as
such
we
think
that
we
need
not
get
any
or
near
attacking
the
jury
as
an
administrator
of
rules.
it
is
very
clear
that
a
professional
sentencer
is
better
at
formulating
rules
adjudication
by
adjudication
than
in
ad
hoc
where
people
in
my
point
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
there
are
number
or
relevant
points
in
nine
capital
sentencing,
apart
from
the
professional
quality
of
the
judge,
professionalism
your
honor
is
a
number
of
things
all
wrapped
into
one.
when
the
fact
that
the
judge
sentences
a
number
of
cases
involved
some
consistency,
he
is
the
man
that
does
at
each
time
if
only
the
consistency
of
his
habit,
there’s
a
consistency
there.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
think
that’s
right
except
in
so
far
as
certain
standards
are
built-in
to
the
assumptions
of
the
system
which
are
not
built-in
to
capital
sentencing
such
as
rehabilitation.
when
a
judge
sentences,
he
knows
that
the
man
whom
he
is
going
to
sentence
is
going
to
come
out
after
a
period
of
time.
and
he
has
to
make
a
judgment
as
to
whether
the
period
is
so
severe
that
the
man
is
going
to
be
a
serious
danger
from
rehabilitative
standpoint.
afterwards,
it’s
not
true
of
the
capital
sentencing
decision.
it’s
also
true
that
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
you
know
our
statutes
that
do,
do
that
in
some
states
but
the
model
sentencing
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
no,
it
is
not.
it
is
not
indeed.
on
the
other
hand,
the
judge
inevitably
is
going
to
do
so
and
the
development
in
evolution
of
sentencing
counsels,
appellate
review
in
some
greater
or
lesser
form
affects
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
a
practice
that
is
possible
because
the
state
provides
an
institutional
nexus
for
it.
both
the
professional
sentence
or
in
the
assumptions
of
the
system,
neither
which
are
true
in
capital
sentencing,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
a
mandatory
death
sentence
it
would
have
none
of
the
problems
that
this
case
raises
your
honor.
i
would
have
troubles
depending
on
the
nature
of
the
statute
under
other
constitutional
provision
but
none
that
are
involved
in
this
case.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
your
honor,
that
is
the
standard
though.
if
everyone
who
is
convicted
of
a
given
crime
is
sentence
to
death,
you
don’t
have
what
we
are
complaining
about
in
this
case
in
individualizing
process
which
selects
without
where
more
reason,
one
person
to
die
and
the
other
person
to
live.
a
jury
sitting
in
one
case
determining
not
perhaps
because
it
takes
a
different
view
of
the
facts
of
this
case
than
the
facts
of
another
case
but
because
it
may
take
a
totally
different
view
of
the
legal
determiners
that
may
find
that
it
need
not
to
have
legal
determiners.
it
may
sentence
one
man
to
live
and
another
to
die.
now
that
is
the
essence
of
the
standards
of
this
complaint
that
we
make.
and
it
does
not
involve
where
you
have
mandatory
capital
sentencing
because
every
one
in
the
class
is
treated
identical.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
our
contention
is
limited
to
capital
cases
and
the
justification
for
us
so
limiting
it
is
--
it
lies
in
three
things
i
think.
first,
this
court
has
made
clear
for
considerable
period
of
time
that
the
degree
of
arbitrariness,
it
is
permissible
in
a
sentencing
system
is
less
where
the
penalty
is
grave
where
i
speak
of
skinner
and
oklahoma.
now
skinner
held
that
you
couldn’t
sterilize
thieves
if
you
didn’t
sterilize
embezzlements.
i
think
that
nobody
on
the
unanimous
court
have
decided
that
case
assume
that
indeed
the
opinions
of
the
contrary
that
you
couldn’t
sentence
embezzlers
to
15
years
and
certain
thieves
to
10.
at
that
level
of
discrimination
or
determination,
there’s
no
question
about
distinguishing
between
embezzlers
and
thieves.
when
you
sterilize
them
or
when
you
kill
them,
that’s
something
else
again.
the
second
consideration
i
think
is
that
and
this
goes
to
mr.
justice
white’s
point
as
well.
that
when
you
are
dealing
with
a
non-capital
sentencing
regime,
there
are
number
of
considerations
that
come
into
play
that
justify
more
arbitrary
individualize
judgments
than
when
you’re
dealing
with
a
capital
sentencing
regime.
non-capital
sentencing
inevitably
involves
in
some
point
the
question
of
reformation
and
the
only
tools
with
which
we
as
a
society
at
the
moment
come
to
grips
with
the
question
of
reformation
are
the
highly
individualize
diagnostic
judgment
that
are
made
of
particular
individuals.
now
i
myself
have
very
serious
troubles
with
the
infusion
of
therapy
in
the
sentencing
because
sentencing
becomes
a
mixed
bag
of
individual
i
supposedly
helpful
therapeutic
considerations
and
penal
judgments
but
the
question
is
to
what
kind
of
standards
to
imply
on
that
process
is
much
a
little
more
like
the
question
involved
in
the
mcgautha
case
as
to
how
much
you
can
justify
some
arbitrariness
in
the
imposition
of
penal
sanctions
in
order
to
serve
therapeutic
ends
which
require
extreme
flexibility.
in
capital
sentencing,
there
is
no
therapeutic
need
and
no
therapeutic
justification.
the
death
penalty
is
the
one
penalty
of
which
one
can
say
cannot
be
justified
for
purposes
of
reformation
or
rehabilitation.
it
is
a
writing
off
of
this
human
preacher
as
fit
for
rehabilitation
and
no
individualize
judgments
of
the
sort
that
need
to
be
made
diagnostically
enter
into
the
judgment.
so
that
there’s
no
excuse
for
the
degree
of
individualization
without
rules
of
law
in
capital
sentencing
that
there
is
non-capital
sentencing.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
your
honor,
i’m
simply
saying
that
this
case
doesn’t
present
that
question.
my
personal
view
is
that
there
is
a
grave
constitutional
deficiency
in
such
a
system.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
think
that
a
great
deal
depends
on
several
things.
what
decision
is
being
made?
the
importance
of
the
decision,
a
life
and
death
quality
decision
is
in
my
judgment
unique.
who
is
making
the
decision?
i
think
there’s
a
difference
between
the
judge
and
the
jury.
i
think
that
the
(inaudible)
case
which
requires
certain
standards
for
jury
action
may
not
mean
that
a
judge
has
sub-standards
in
taxing
costs.
i
think
that
the
parameters,
the
outer
boundaries
of
judgment
are
very
important.
if
i
may
let
me
try
to
frame
this
issue
in
terms
of
one
that
is
more
familiar
to
this
court’s
jurisprudence
historically.
the
question
that
is
raise
as
i
see
by
our
standards
attack
is
in
not
a
typical
question
of
how
you
limit
discretion
and
keep
it
within
constitutional
confines.
if
you
take
for
example
a
legislature
that
wants
to
regulate
parades
in
the
state
it
could
simply
pass
a
permit
statute
that
says
no
one
may
conduct
a
procession
without
the
permit
from
the
chief
of
police.
now
that
would
raise
the
greatest
constitutional
difficulties
under
the
decisions
of
this
court.
now
if
it
wanted
to
enact
to
one
that
delimited
the
discretion
how
might
it
go
about
it.
there
are
whole
host
of
ways
in
which
it
might
go
about
it.
one
it
might
say
whoever
conducts
a
procession
with
vehicles
or
a
procession
on
the
streets
or
a
procession
on
pennsylvania
avenue
between
14th
street
and
the
capital
that
delimits
the
range
of
cases
within
which
the
judgment
is
being
made.
secondly,
it
might
say
that
in
determining
whether
a
permit
shall
issue
the
chief
of
police
shall
take
account
of
traffic
congestion,
the
movement
of
emergency
vehicles,
simply
whether
there
is
another
parade
or
procession
the
same
day
and
that
sort
of
thing.
third,
it
might
subject
the
judgment
of
the
permit
issuer
to
review
by
another
agency
by
a
court.
now
each
one
of
this
without
getting
rid
of
discretion
totally
delimits
the
discretion
and
again
it
would
make
a
considerable
difference
whether
the
permit
is
totally
unavailable
or
whether
the
permit
issuer
only
had
the
power
to
put
it
off
for
a
day
set
it
some
time
within
the
week
but
not
in
a
particular
day
requested
and
that
sort
of
thing.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
precisely
and
what
--
where
i
think
we
are
in
this
case
is
where
this
court
was
in
1930
when
they
first
began
to
enact
permit
ordinances.
it
simply
has
to
say
whether
an
arkansas
procedure
which
has
available
to
it,
all
of
the
different
devices
by
which
they
might
control
the
discretion
limiting
the
range
of
cases
to
which
it
applies
providing
for
aggravating
circumstances
and
prerequisite
findings
of
fact
precluding
the
death
penalty
when
certain
mitigating
findings
are
made.
establishing
rules
or
principles
or
even
just
telling
the
jury
so
that
they
have
something
to
talk
about
when
they
go
back
there
and
they
all
have
to
agree
that
you
must
come
to
a
decision
consonant
with
some
certain
principle.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
am
not
saying
that
the
constitution
does
not
require
standards
to
be
judge.
i’m
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
saying
only
that
this
case
does
not
raise
it.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
that
is
correct.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
thank
you
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
--
the
third
is
more
limited
to
arkansas
and
to
this
case
and
it
is
that
the
arkansas
supreme
court
does
review
sentences
imposed
by
juries
in
non-capital
cases
and
it
does
not
in
capital
cases.
and
as
i
was
trying
to
sketch
out,
it
makes
for
me
a
great
deal
of
difference
whether
the
discretion
is
limited
by
a
review
or
whether
it
is
not.
that’s
one
of
the
factors
that
makes
the
discretion
given
juries
in
death
cases
totally
arbitrary
with
no
restraint,
no
protection
against
us.
now,
i’m
not
passing
at
this
point
beyond
the
standards
argument.
i
launch
to
offend
this
and
the
court
simply
of
describing
the
standard
was
trial.
i’d
like
to
finish
if
i
may
my
description
of
the
trial
process
and
then
state
briefly
the
two
constitutional
contentions
that
emerge
from
it.
the
arkansas
jury
not
only
makes
the
guilt
and
penalty
determinations
but
make
some
at
one
sitting
if
the
defendant
contests
guilt.
all
the
evidence
be
it
on
all
questions
is
submitted
at
once.
the
jury
goes
out
and
returns
a
verdict
both
on
guilt
and
on
punishment.
now,
the
effect
of
this,
the
most
immediate
effect
of
this
is
fairly
obvious.
if
the
defendant
takes
the
stand
to
speak
to
have
his
voice
heard
by
the
people
of
the
power
of
life
and
death
decision
over
him,
he
runs
into
all
of
the
prejudices
that
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
is
intended
to
protect
him
against.
first,
if
he
takes
the
stand
and
doesn’t
claim
innocence
he
is
going
to
be
convicted.
there
is
just
no
doubt
that
the
jury
will
convict
him
when
he
gets
on
the
stand,
testifies
and
doesn’t
say,
i
didn’t
do
it.
if
he
gets
on
the
stand
and
he
does
testify
that
he
didn’t
do
it.
be
subject
to
cross-examination
which
is
clearly
potentially
incriminating.
in
addition
to
that
under
arkansas
procedure,
he
is
subjected
to
impeachment
of
the
most
vicious
sort.
literally,
every
bad
act
however
remote
and
whether
reduced
to
conviction
or
not
can
come
in
against
them
with
inevitable
prejudice
on
the
guilt
determination.
on
the
other
hand,
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
there
is
only
one
limitation
that
i
know
of
your
honor.
there
are
couple
of
arkansas
cases
that
say
that
a
bad
act
which
is
too
remote
may
not
be
proved
but
the
arkansas
court
has
admitted
for
example
a
minor
liquor
violation,
20
years
old
and
an
automobile
accident,
24
years
old
those
sorts
of
things.
so,
i
think
the
remoteness
requirement
is
insignificant
and
the
practical
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
however
prejudicial,
for
example
we
have
cited
in
our
brief.
cases
in
which
the
man
on
in
trial
for
murder
who
took
the
stand
was
impeached
by
showing
that
he
had
committed
a
prior
murder.
it’s
relevance
to
credibility
is
questionable
but
it’s
prejudiced
on
the
guilt
issue
as
obvious.
now
this
is
the
kind
of
thing
for
which
he
let’s
himself
in
if
he
takes
the
stand.
on
the
other
hand,
if
he
doesn’t
take
the
stand,
he
literally
goes
to
slaughter
like
a
dumb
beast.
he
is
deprived
of
his
best
witness
on
facts
and
mitigation.
he
is
the
only
person
who
can
tell
about
his
motivation
particular
circumstances
that
may
have
let
out
to
the
act
for
which
he
subsequently
convicted
which
may
convince
the
jury
in
its
totally
unfettered
discretion
not
to
sentence
him
to
death.
he
is
the
best
witness
on
background
facts.
facts
about
his
childhood,
his
upbringing
that
jury
may
take
into
account.
more
than
that,
his
testimony
is
the
only
thing
that
can
bring
home
to
the
jury
that
they
are
sentencing
a
human
being,
a
live
human
being
who
may
have
heard
speak
like
other
human
beings
and
lies
the
characteristic
of
speech
that
human
beings
have.
they
are
sentencing
such
a
person
to
death.
and
what
happens
in
a
case
like
william
maxwell
is
that
if
a
defendant
decides
that
he
is
going
to
exercise
his
privilege
against
self-incrimination
and
not
take
the
stand
and
not
be
subject
to
impeachment.
and
not
proved
guilt
out
of
his
own
mouth.
he
goes
to
life
or
death
decision
without
the
jury’s
ever
having
heard
a
word
uttered
by
him.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
would
say
the
facts
are
described
in
the
arkansas
supreme
court’s
opinion
in
370
s.w.2nd
and
i
think
this
court
could
notice
the
facts
described
in
it.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
the
trial
transcript
your
honor
is
not
in
this
record
and
there
is
a
recitation
of
the
facts
as
fairly
complete
by
the
arkansas
supreme
court
on
appeal.
as
to
arkansas
is
taking
any
position
to
the
jury
thus
indeed
rely
on
those
facts,
the
answer
is
we
simply
don’t
know.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
it’s
not
required.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
suppose
that
might
be.
the
proof
doesn’t
seem
to
meet
the
theory
because
the
evidence
that
we
have
gathered
indicates
that
there
are
three
factors
which
distinguish
people
who
are
sentenced
to
death
from
people
who
are
sentence
to
life
generally
in
arkansas
race.
the
commission
of
the
contemporaneous
offense,
some
other
offense
like
robbery
which
maxwell
did
not
commit
and
a
prior
record
imprisonment
and
we
do
not
know
whether
maxwell
has
any
such
prior
record
in
imprisonment
on
this
record.
it
may
well
be
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
we
would
not
know
from
the
trial
record
maxwell.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
by
exercising
the
privilege
avoided
going
into
the
question
of
background
at
all
with
the
result
and
this
is
not
a
typical
that
a
defendant
who
claims
the
privilege
has
the
jury
decide
whether
or
not
he
should
leave
based
on
five
minutes
of
his
life
or
10
minutes
of
his
life.
all
they
know
about
this
man
is
what
they
have
heard
that
he
did
in
the
few
minutes
constituting
the
crime.
no
more
than
that
is
known.
now,
whether
or
not
the
theory
of
arkansas
is
that
they
act
on
that.
our
theory
is
that
they
need
not
act
on
that
under
arkansas
law.
arkansas
law
allows
the
jury
to
act
on
something
broader
than
that
if
it
is
present,
but
the
defending
can
present
it
only
at
the
cause
of
waiving
his
federal
constitutional
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
mr.
justice
stewart,
the
status
of
the
trial
transcript
in
this
case
is
very
confused.
let
me
state
it
briefly
as
best
as
i
can.
the
pretrial
order
of
the
federal
district
judge
in
this
case
provided
that
the
transcript
would
be
available
and
that
portions
of
it
might
be
put
in
to
the
record
by
counsel
if
they
wish.
no
portions
were
formally
put
into
the
record.
on
the
other
hand,
the
trial
transcript
had
been
around
in
the
district
court
for
a
long
while.
this
being
maxwell
second
habeas
corpus
petition
and
the
district
judge
in
fact
relied
on
it
in
some
part
although
none
of
it
was
formally
introduced
for
some
of
his
findings
such
as
a
finding
that
maxwell
did
not
take
the
stand.
the
transcript
because
it
was
not
in
the
record
in
the
district
court
did
not
go
up
to
the
eighth
circuit.
shortly
before
the
decision
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit,
the
clerk
of
that
court
wrote
counsel
asking
the
copy
of
the
trial
transcript
be
furnished
and
the
court
of
appeals
also
relied
on
certain
aspects
of
it
such
as
portions
of
the
opening
argument
by
defense
counsel
in
that
sort
of
thing.
again,
formally
it’s
not
here.
i
do
not
think
that
the
transcript
is
in
fact
before
this
court.
it
is
not
physically
here
but
i
do
not
think
that
it
is
in
fact
here.
however,
certainly,
those
facts
which
appear
in
the
opinions
below
or
in
the
opinion
of
the
arkansas
supreme
court
might
properly
be
relied
on
by
this
court.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
oh
yes
and
i
don’t
think
there’s
–
indeed,
we've
going
to
the
point
of
actually
in
our
appendix
say
according
portion
of
it
none
otherwise
because
they
think
it’s
non-controversial
and
it
is
a
public
record
of
course.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
don’t
know
when
it’s
technically
lodged
there.
it
certainly
was
sent
there
and
they
do
have
a
copy.
now
if
i
may
briefly
pass
from
what
i
had
intended
to
be
merely
descriptive
to
the
argument.
the
standards
question
seems
to
be
resolved
by
the
briefing
in
this
case
into
a
relatively
simple
matter.
we
contend
that
the
power
given
arkansas
jury’s
to
sentence
to
life
or
death
is
legally
arbitrary
in
violation
in
the
rule
of
due
process.
it
offense
we
think
every
aspect
of
the
rule
of
law
that
this
court
has
found
previously
in
the
due
process
clause.
first
of
all,
it
involves
sentencing
on
a
case
by
case
basis
by
jurors
who
need
not
even
discuss
why
they
choose
to
send
the
man
to
death.
if
they
do
discuss
why
and
they
decide
on
a
common
ground,
there
is
no
assurance
that
that
ground
is
common
to
any
other
defendant
but
this
defendant.
the
man
who
was
just
tried
and
just
convicted
and
just
sentenced
to
life
might
have
facts
like
identical
with
those
of
the
defendant
who
now
goes
to
death.
the
only
difference
being
that
because
arkansas
provides
no
help,
the
jury
state
different
views
neither
of
the
facts
but
of
the
law.
a
necessary
consequence
of
that
kind
of
arbitrariness
and
decision
making
is
that
people
are
unequally
treated
in
violation
of
the
notion
basic
we
submit
to
both
due
process
in
equal
protection
that
requires
evenhanded
administration
of
justice.
people
treated
similarly.
it
doesn’t
mean
no
individualization
in
sentencing.
but
it
means
individualization
on
a
rational
basis
not
on
a
hit
or
miss
flip
basis
that
arises
from
having
no
standards
whatever
from
making
the
sentencing
decision.
it
also
means
that
not
only
are
the
people
who
are
sentence
to
death
treated
unevenly,
unequally
as
against
those
sentenced
to
life.
but
they
are
treated
irrationally,
in
the
sense
that
there
is
no
relationship,
no
assured
connection
between
the
purposes
for
having
a
death
penalty
at
all
and
its
imposition
in
this
case.
there
is
nothing
to
assure
that
whatever
arkansas
may
want
to
achieve
by
allowing
rapes
to
be
punished
by
death.
that
on
the
fact
of
this
particular
case
with
justification
attaches.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
it
is
not
your
honor.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
well,
it
depends.
now,
again
the
federal
statute
is
somewhat
different.
some
of
them
give
the
judge
sentencing
power
or
just
give
the
jury
sentencing
power.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
as
to
the
federal
statutes
that
give
the
jury
sentencing
power,
they
do
it
in
the
same
that
arkansas
does.
and
that
indeed
is
true.
i’m
quick
to
admit
of
most
jurisdictions.
now
there
are
differences
in
terms
of
there
were
degree
of
reviewability
of
the
jury’s
judgment,
some
jurisdictions
provide
that
they
jury
must
make
the
determination
on
the
evidence
of
record
but
arkansas
does
not.
there
are
also
is
about
the
minor
differences
but
the
major
thrust
of
the
arkansas
procedure
is
not
use
in
the
federal
courts
in
jury
sentencing
and
elsewhere.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
pardon
me,
mr.
justice
brennan?
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
well,
in
illinois
for
example,
the
concurrence
of
the
trial
judge
and
the
jury
is
necessary.
in
arkansas,
the
jury
alone
makes
a
decision
and
as
i’ve
indicated
i
think
there
are
may
be
difference
in
response
to
mr.
justice
fortas’
question.
there
may
be
a
difference
if
you
have
a
judge
sentencing.
there
may
not
but
there
may
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
the
only
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
no,
i
think,
i
think
not
except
to
the
extent.
it
does
come
to
the
interrelatedness
of
our
two
arguments
where
you
have
a
split
verdict
procedure.
we
have
a
two-trial
procedure.
the
effect
may
be
different
because
the
jury
has
a
plenary
penalty
trial
as
more
to
basic
judgment
on.
but
in
specific
response
to
your
honor’s
question,
the
answer
is
that
they
are
equally
without
standards.
frankly,
what
has
happened
simply
is
this.
the
legislature
had
passed
the
buck
all
over.
we
have
mandatory
capital
sentencing
for
an
off
a
long
time.
and
when
that
became
politically
impossible
to
maintain,
instead
of
proceeding
to
determine
in
what
case
is
the
death
penalty
would
be
implied
the
legislatures
all
over
simply
said
we
can’t
decide
this
so
i’m
going
to
pass
it
under
the
jury
and
they
simply
made
it
discretionary.
they
did
--
they
are
differing
forms
of
substance
of
crime,
differing
procedures
the
notions
of
discretion
is
essentially
common.
now
the
--
a
third,
i
think
vitally
important
thing
you
recognize
in
the
regime
which
is
common
and
in
practice
in
arkansas
is
simply
that
the
jury
can
get
away
with
the
most
flagrant
violations
of
clear
constitutional
rights
without
getting
caught
at.
one
of
the
purposes
of
the
rule
of
law
of
the
requirement
that
procedures
be
regular
systematically
apply
and
applicable
to
all
like
cases
is
simply
to
prevent
against
abuse.
now
what
we
have
in
arkansas
and
this
is
what
i
think
is
the
relevance
of
the
racial
evidence
on
this
record
is
a
sentencing
pattern
of
clear
racial
discrimination.
it
couldn’t
be
caught
said
the
district
court
because
the
factors
that
go
into
the
jury’s
decision
case
by
case
are
so
intangible,
so
difficult
to
catch
on
to
that
you
can’t
prove
that
even
a
jury
which
even
a
set
of
juries
of
which
convict
negroes
of
raping
white
victims
and
sentence
them
to
death
disproportionately
frequently
or
in
fact
discriminate.
we
don’t
know.
they
may
be
all
sorts
of
intangible
factors
other
than
race
that
affects
it.
the
eighth
circuit
took
the
view
that
somewhat
more
hardheaded
that
probably
juries
are
in
fact
discriminated
generally.
but
maxwell’s
theory
probably
didn’t
discriminate.
again,
how
do
you
know?
there’s
no
way.
the
jury
didn’t
have
to
have
any
reason
little
on
any
specific
reason
for
fixing
the
death
penalty
and
so
what
happens
under
a
regime
of
this
sort
is
not
only
that
the
giving
up
of
all
political
responsibility
in
the
representatives
of
the
people,
legislature
to
fix
standards
of
general
application
passing
the
buck
in
effect
to
individual
juries.
but
when
individual
juries
react
in
a
way
which
violates
the
most
clear
and
unequivocal
commands
of
the
constitution,
a
court
can’t
catch
them
out.
now,
our
submission
essentially
is
that
such
a
regime
violates
a
rule
of
law
basic
to
do
process.
that
there
is
in
here
in
the
very
notion
of
due
process
of
law,
the
requirement
of
a
rule
of
law
which
governs
light
cases
and
applies.
i
think
that
this
court
would
not
for
example
sustain
an
arkansas
sentencing
procedure
which
provided
that
every
man
convicted
of
rape
should
roll
a
dice
and
if
it
came
up
7
or
11,
he
would
die.
and
any
other
numbers,
he
would
live.
actually,
what
arkansas
has
done
is
worst.
it’s
worst
because
i
assume
that
the
dice
would
not
discriminate
on
grounds
of
race
and
its
worst
because
the
2
out
of
12
chances
that
each
man
would
have
are
at
least
identical.
we
have
not
even
that
assurance.
and
the
argument
is
made
by
arkansas
and
it’s
made
by
california
and
everybody
is
being
treated
evenhandedly
and
equally
under
the
sentencing
procedure.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
would
be
glad
to
address
that.
there
are
several
ways
i
think
a
legislature
could
go
about
it.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
as
far
as
the
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
as
far
as
the
federal
constitution
was
concerned,
it
would
satisfy
our
demands
for
a
constitutional
rule
of
law
provided
that
the
following
conditions
were
met.
one,
that
the
standards
were
announced
by
the
highest
court
of
the
state
or
at
least
approved
by
it
so
that
the
same
standards
were
now
as
by
different
trial
judges
in
different
cases.
two,
that
the
standards
were
made
clear
before
the
trial
so
that
the
defendant
would
have
a
fair
opportunity
to
know
what
he
was
trying
at
the
trial
provided
that
those
two
conditions
were
met.
and
that
the
standards
themselves
met
the
substantive
requirements
of
definiteness
for
standards.
it
wouldn’t
matter
whether
they
were
done
legislatively
or
judicially
and
i
would
think
it’s
a
matter
of
state
policy.
it
would
be
quite
improper
for
a
court
to
promulgate
this
justice
i
as
i
was
going
to
suggest,
i’m
troubled
about
suggesting
specific
standards
to
this
court
because
the
individual
standards
that
one
designs
are
responsive
to
the
most
fundamental
penological
policy
questions
as
to
why
you
use
the
death
penalty
and
when
and
that’s
a
matter
of
legislative.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
let
me
respond
to
that
in
two
ways.
first,
by
saying
that
i
have
in
mind
something
not
terribly
unlike
the
approach
taken
by
the
model
penal
code
although
that’s
not
an
exclusive
approach
and
then
although
again
i
voice
caution
for
two
reasons.
first
of
all
the
model
penal
codes
description
of
the
aggravating
and
mitigating
circumstances
and
that
sort
of
thing
applies
to
murder
and
not
rape
and
so
it’s
of
no
use
particularly
in
drafting
a
rape
statute
and
also
because
i
have
very
grave
trouble
about
certain
of
the
specific
formulations
of
the
model
penal
code.
for
example,
one
of
the
aggravating
circumstances
that
is
it
a
crime
is
attrocious.
that
troubles
me.
i
think
that
they
could
describe
and
get
out
what
they
want
in
terms
of
it
being
committed
on
a
minor
child
or
helpless
person
or
being
committed
with
considerable
willful
infliction
of
pain
so
that
there
are
number
of
details
about
the
model
penal
code.
i
might
quarrel
that
the
approach
is
a
not
insignificant
model.
now,
second
way
to
respond
to
that
is
to
try
to
give
you
what
i
think
of
it
some
ways
in
which
a
legislature
concerned
with
the
crime
of
rape
might
put
standards
into
a
sentencing
statute.
one
way,
they
might
go
about
it
is
in
the
manner
i
suggested
in
describing
what
arkansas
didn’t
have.
you
can
have
required
factual
findings,
prerequisite
factual
findings.
you
can
consider
them
if
you
will
aggravate
in
circumstances.
the
jury
may
not
impose
the
death
penalty
unless
it
finds
that
the
defendant
used
a
weapon
that
he
injured
the
victim
permanently
in
a
physical
way
that
he
committed
the
offense
on
a
victim
of
gravely
disparate
age.
one
can
enumerate
half
dozen
by
of
course,
it
simply
indicate
that’s
one
approach.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
then
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
well,
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
no,
i
don’t
think
that’s
necessarily
so.
i
have
trouble
in
conceiving
the
matter
that
way
for
two
reasons.
one,
the
arkansas
legislature
hasn’t
release
any
other
kind
of
rape.
it
said
that
that
penalty
is
available
for
any
other
kind
of
rape
but
we
don’t
really
expect
that
it
will
be
impose
of
any
other
kind
of
rape.
it’s
going
to
be
imposed
either
wholly
or
arbitrarily
or
in
some
set
of
sub-classes
and
it’s
made
no
attempt
whatever
to
define
those
sub-classes
but
in
addition
to
that
this
is
only
one
of
the
ways
in
which
a
legislature
might
regularize
the
procedure.
if
a
legislature
said
that
the
governing
issue
was
the
atrocity
of
the
crime.
at
least
that
would
allow
the
jury
to
consider
that
in
focus
as
distinguished
from
the
character
of
the
defendant.
if
the
legislature
said
yes,
any
old
kind
of
rape
but
the
issue
is
how
bad
is
the
defendant?
is
he
reformable?
will
the
public
safety
be
served
adequately
by
imprisoning
him
for
life
instead
of
killing
of
him?
that
would
be
a
test
the
jury
could
apply
which
would
focus
in
far
more
than
we
have
the
issue
before
the
jury.
if
i
may,
i’d
like
to
simply
state
that
the
essence
of
our
constitutional
contention
with
regard
to
the
single
trial
procedure
is
related
but
distinct
from
the
attack
on
the
standard
was
penalty
trial
related
because
as
the
factual
description
i’ve
given
you
in
the
case.
any
defendant,
who
claims
his
privilege
against
self-incrimination
necessarily
goes
to
trial
for
his
life
in
front
of
a
jury
which
is
totally
uninformed,
totally
deprived
of
the
requisites
of
information
for
rationally
sensing
it
and
therefore
the
arbitrariness
which
the
standard
list
discretion
allows.
almost
inevitably
in
fact
is
what
occurs
in
sentencing
the
jury
has
no
basis
on
which
to
sentence
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
this
case
and
our
submission
do
not
raise
that
question.
i
think
that
other
provisions
of
the
constitution
and
those
we
invoke
here
do
require
that.
but
that’s
no
point
of
our
submission
here.
what
we
do
say
is
this,
that
where
a
state
authorizes
each
jury
to
take
any
view
of
the
law
and
any
view
of
the
facts
and
sentence
the
defendant
to
life
or
death
on
any
basis
that
if
it
then
requires
the
defendant
to
forego
the
exercise
of
his
privilege
against
self-incrimination
as
the
cost
of
putting
before
the
jury
material
on
which
rational
sentencing
decision
can
be
based
that
he
has
so
burdened
the
exercise
of
the
privilege
and
so
deprived
of
rationality
the
determination
which
is
ultimately
made
by
the
jury
of
the
defendant
exercises
his
privilege
that
the
due
process,
of
course
along
with
the
fifth
amendment
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
do
not
know
whether
there
is
a
provision
for
pre-sentence
reports
in
non-capital
cases.
i
would
assume
that
there
was
none.
i
would
assume
so
because
non-capital
sentencing
is
also
done
by
jury
in
arkansas
in
the
ordinary
procedure
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
would
assume.
if
i
may,
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
counsel
are
permitted
to
argue
to
the
jury,
yes.
and
both
counsels
may
argue
to
the
jury
with
regard
to
the
death
sentences.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
of
course,
the
difference
is
that
prosecution
is
also
of
good
things
to
argue
from,
his
got
the
crime
and
defense
counsel
if
the
defendant
exercised
the
privileges
nothing
argued.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
mr.
justice
stewart,
my
statement
that
counsel
are
permitted
to
argue
to
the
jury
arises
from
my
observation
of
reading
a
transcripts
in
arkansas
death
cases.
there
is
no
decision
of
the
arkansas
supreme
court
which
specifically
talks
about
counsel
arguing
to
the
jury
at
all.
let
alone
defines
what
arguments
are
proper
and
what
arguments
are
not.
one
can
find
nothing
in
arkansas
case
law
that
is
instructive
about
standards
that
stems
from
the
argument.
i
simply
state
from
observation
that
counsel
are
indeed
permitted
by
the
trial
court
to
argue
the
penalty
issue
of
the
jury
although
as
your
honor
suggests
in
other
states
not
even
that
is
permitted,
the
discretion
is
suppose
to
be
so
arcained
a
matter
that
it
emerges
services
and
works
its
doings
only
in
the
jury
room.
that’s
not
so
in
arkansas.
if
i
may
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
so
far
as
i
know,
there
is
no
--
there
has
been
no
reported
decision
challenging
a
prosecutor’s
argument
or
sustaining
a
defense
counsel’s
argument
or
whatever
but
the
discretion
is
absolute
and
one
would
assume
that
if
the
discretion
is
absolute
that
absolutely
anything
may
be
argued.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
no,
but
it
would
be
better
than
arkansas
because
at
least
the
focus
is
on
the
crime.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
oh,
i
must
therefore
your
honor.
i
think
that’s
not
so
every
rape
crime
is
a
serious
crime
there’s
no
doubt
about
it.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
well,
cutting
her
up,
she
suffered
some
cuts
and
bruises.
you
--
no.
your
honor,
must
remember,
what
we
are
talking
about
is
a
state
in
which
we
have
intra-racial
crimes,
14%
of
the
cases
get
out.
now,
one
asks
you
know
just
guessing
whether
this
isn’t
the
most
serious
14%
of
the
cases.
i
would
say,
having
seen
a
lot
this
cases
that
in
my
judgment
at
least
that
it
is
not
but
that
is
a
judgment
in
any
event
that
i
leave
to
your
honor.
however,
the
important
thing
is
the
jury
doesn’t
think
about
that.
jury
doesn’t
have
to
care
whether
this
is
atrocious
not
atrocious,
heinous,
where
the
victim
was
injured
where,
the
cuts
were
accidental,
how
long
they
lasted,
whether
they
were
cured,
any
of
those
things.
none
of
that’s
relevant.
the
jury
does
goes
out
and
decides.
but
maybe
they
don’t
like
to
follow
the
defendant.
may
sense
some,
yes.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
my
position
would
be
that
something
which
simply
gave
a
judge
the
power
to
do
the
same
arbitrate
test
the
jury
is
now
doing
would
not
be
constitutional.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i’m
sorry.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
if
they
did
that?
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
yes.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
well,
although
it’s
worst
to
give
a
jury
this
kind
of
discretion,
it
seems
to
me
that
what
one
does
when
it
passes
it
to
the
judge
with
no
more
than
that
is
essentially
to
again
permit
a
judge
to
make
individual
judgments
case
by
case
which
need
to
have
no
relationship
to
the
judgment
pass
in
the
next
case.
now
there’s
not
quite
as
that
in
the
jury
because
a
judge
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i’m
not
sure
i
understand
the
question,
your
honor.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
non-capital,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
that
is
correct.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
a
hundred
years
in
some
offenses.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
oh,
yes,
your
honor
certainly.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
except
those
which
are
assumed
within
the
preconditions
of
the
judicial
role
or
which
emerged
form
the
fact
that
it’s
mr.
justice
white
has
put
it,
you
have
a
professional
sentencer
subject
to
common
aspirations,
common
experience
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
in
my
judgment,
i
would
not
although
again
i
must
refer
the
court
to
a
distinction
that
i
think
is
crucial
between
capital
and
non-capital
sentencing.
i
think
there
are
justifications
for
a
more
clinical
case
by
case
approach
in
non-capital
sentencing
that
are
not
available
in
capital
sentencing
and
i
am
clear
from
the
decisions
of
this
court
that
the
degree
of
arbitrariness
allowable
is
greater
with
the
imposition
is
greater
and
the
death
penalty
is
the
greatest
known
demand.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
for
this
case,
i
have
no
intentions
to
go
and
step
behind.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
have
very
great
difficulty
with
the
whole
regime
of
sentencing
in
the
discretion
that
we
had.
and
so
to
a
lot
of
other
people
but
i
need
to
know
further
in
this
case
and
death
cases.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
it
was
not
a
constitutional
assumption.
it
was
assumption
as
to
what
illinois
law
required.
if
a
state,
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
the
court
said
permits
this
kind
of
discretion
then
it
cannot
stuck
the
jury
in
exercising
the
discretion.
but
i
think
the
court
needed
to
make
none
and
made
none
of
the
kind
of
assumption
that
is
of
the
constitutional
nature
that
only
could
do
this.
the
question
was
not
raise
in
witherspoon
whether
illinois
did
do
it.
it
appear
that
illinois
had
done
it
and
the
question
was
whether
you
can
give
the
jury
unfettered
discretion
and
then
skew
people
who
exercise.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
no,
although
it
would
present
a
limitation
in
each
question
of
diminished
responsibility
or
narrower
definition
of
the
crime
or
whatever.
now
is
the
outer
parameters
if
the
discretion
and
therefore
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
if
it
were
put
in
as
a
limitation
on
the
death
penalty,
as
distinguished
from
a
limitation
on
conviction.
it
might
do
that
but
then
again
you
fall
into
the
problem
of
the
single
verdict
trial.
we
don’t
know
whether
maxwell
has
to
diminish
responsibility
or
anything
else
because
it
couldn’t
present
evidence
on
that
without
waiving
the
privilege.
again,
the
interrelatedness
of
the
two
issues
becomes
apparent.
the
diminished
responsibility
alone
would
solve
neither
of
our
two
constitutional
contentions
separately
or
together.
thank
you.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i’d
prefer
to
reserve
it
if
i’m
right
for
rebuttal.
i’ve
gone
a
way
and
i
would
not
take
the
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
we
have
no
objection
in
having
the
court
have
the
transcript
before
it.
i
would
like
to
speak
in
rebuttal
as
to
the
propriety
of
ruling
on
the
witness
per
issue.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
we
certainly
have
no
objection
on
the
transcript.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
i
would
like
to
address
three
things
if
i
may
in
rebuttal.
one,
the
substantive
arguments
for
the
states
of
california
and
arkansas,
only
very
briefly.
two,
the
witherspoon
question
in
this
case.
and
three,
the
point
brought
up
by
california
as
the
differences
between
california
and
arkansas
procedure
and
the
relevance
of
that
for
disposition
of
this
matter.
my
response
on
this
substantive
level
can
be,
i
think
very
brief.
as
i
understand
that
both
california
and
arkansas
admit
that
we
got
an
arbitrary
procedure
going
here
and
they
defended
simply
on
the
ground
that
it’s
necessary,
they
can’t
do
anything
else
whether
it’s
beneficial
to
the
defendant.
both
in
reading
the
brief
and
in
hearing
the
oral
argument,
i
was
struck
that
i
heard
this
argument
somewhere
before.
and
so
i
look
around
i
found
it
indeed,
i
have.
this
--
the
argument
that
you
have
to
allow
arbitrary
discretion
so
is
to
individualize
on
the
facts
of
each
individual
cases,
originally
written
by
william
taylor
in
1785.
he
was
defending
the
english
bloody
code
under
which
250
crimes
were
capital.
and
he
defended
that
on
the
ground
that
you
couldn’t
get
a
narrower
formulation.
just
no
way
i
which
you
could
cut
down
on
some
of
these
crimes
by
fixing
standards,
taking
somewhat
might
have
been
careful.
he
said,
the
preference
for
the
english
system
of
having
a
broad
net
in
which
he
can
make
capital
punishment
available
and
then
letting
the
executive
commute
was
in
the
consideration
that
the
selection
of
proper
objects
for
capital
punishment
depends
principally
upon
circumstances
which
however
easy
to
perceive
in
each
particular
case
after
the
crime
is
committed.
it
is
impossible
to
enumerate
or
define
before
him
and
so
on.
and
he
concluded
eventually
that
the
law
of
england
was
based
on
the
wise
policy
of
sweeping
into
the
net
every
crime
which
under
any
possible
circumstances
may
marred
the
punishment
of
death
and
then
letting
individual
circumstances
furthered
out
and
concluded
that
the
wisdom
and
humanity
of
this
design
furnish
a
just
excuse
for
the
multiplicity
of
capital
offenses
which
the
laws
of
england
are
accused
to
creating
beyond
those
of
other
countries
as
the
bloody
code
was
justified.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
about
250,
your
honor.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
that’s
correct.
the
only
other
thing
i
need
to
answer
to
this
suggestion
that
the
arbitrary
discretion
is
justified
by
necessity
or
beneficence
is
that
it
makes
an
awful
difference
who
you
are
being
beneficent
to.
it
might
well
be
that
you
defendants
might
get
a
better
shake.
a
lot
of
them
would
get
more
even
handy
justice
and
makes
difference
whether
it
was
white
or
black
defendants
that
you’re
talking
about
in
terms
of
whether
this
are
good
or
bad
system.
but
in
any
event
i
want
to
emphasize
that
our
argument
does
not
take
discretion,
compassion,
or
anything
else
out
of
the
system.
that
is
what
mr.
justice
fortas
was
talking
about
when
he
spoke
about
the
next
question
or
the
next
case.
the
question
is
whether
standards
can
be
devised
which
lead
compassion
in
but
narrow
the
range
of
discretion
beyond
what
arkansas
allowed
and
our
only
contention
here
is
that
arkansas
has
found
the
net
too
broadly
and
delimited
to
discretion
too
little.
we
do
not
contend
for
mandatory
categories
which
we
throw
out
wisdom
and
pity
and
compassion.
we
simply
contend
for
rule
of
law
that
limits
the
application
of
the
death
penalty
much
more
narrow
that
arkansas
does.
now
the
second
thing
i
want
to
address
myself
to
is
witherspoon.
i
hope
that
in
looking
at
the
transcript
of
--
what
we
argue
in
this
case
this
court
will
remember
a
number
of
things.
first,
witherspoon
has
been
generally
cut
to
ribbons
by
the
courts
below.
and
i
don’t
think
the
court
can
likely
assume
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
not
arkansas
your
honor,
by
every
lower
court
that
i’ve
seen
decided
witherspoon
case
since
witherspoon
earlier.
there
are
dozens
of
them
pending
on
certiorari
here.
the
kind
of
cutting
the
ribbons
i’m
talking
about
is
that
the
lower
courts
(a)
have
eased
up
on
the
kind
of
opposition
to
the
death
penalty
that
permits
exclusion.
secondly,
they
have
authorized
exclusion
where
question
is
asked
which
the
pretty
good
witherspoon
question
but
the
answer
is
equivocal.
they
authorize
exclusion.
three,
they
read
pre-witherspoon
records
and
saw
they
were
done
in
light
up
witherspoon
assume
that
the
jury
is
saying
something
that
meets
the
witherspoon
testing.
go
ahead
and
let
him
sit
for
a
number
of
courts
have
held
that
if
only
a
couple
of
jurors
are
thrown
off
under
witherspoon,
it
doesn’t
make
it
bad
as
only
a
couple
were
here.
five,
the
courts
have
held
that
if
the
prosecutor’s
remaining
pre-emptor
challenges
exceed
the
number
of
juries
in
question
that
that
sentence
doesn’t
get
vacated
under
witherspoon.
i
raised
all
these
for
this
reason.
this
case
has
never
had
a
witherspoon
claim
at.
the
habeas
petition
was
filed
prior
to
witherspoon.
the
district
court
specifically
since
this
is
a
second
federal
habeas
corpus
petition
as
whether
there
were
other
issues
in
the
case.
witherspoon
was
never
put
in
here.
the
court
said,
you
know
i’m
going
to
be
very
weary
about
--
weary
and
wary
about
entertaining
a
third.
i
just
wouldn’t
simply
assume
that
this
case
going
to
be
settled
or
that
maxwell
is
going
to
stay
alive
for
vindication
of
some
witherspoon
claim
and
again
i’m
worried
about
the
witherspoon
claims
on
this
record
in
term
unless
this
court
sets
right.
all
of
the
developments
of
post-witherspoon
law
which
it
made
a
very
limited
ruling
indeed
out
of
witherspoon,
more
than
that,
maxwell
has
been
on
death
row
in
arkansas
since
1962.
he
has
twice
come
within
a
few
days
of
his
death,
the
last
time
to
be
saved
only
by
a
stay
issued
by
mr.
justice
white
of
this
court.
what
a
lot
of
courts
are
doing
in
light
of
witherspoon
is
the
same,
we
vacate
the
death
since
we
give
them
a
new
trial,
new
penalty
trial
now
to
determine
whether
he
should
live
or
die.
it
would
be
inhumanity
second
only
to
killing
this
man.
not
to
resolve
the
issue
now
finally
presented
whether
the
state
of
arkansas
has
any
right
to
be
trying
this
man
for
his
life
under
the
unconstitutional
procedures
that
we
are
challenging.
i
can
appreciate
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
don’t.
i
think
i
have
two
reactions
to
it.
one,
i
doubt
it.
depends
on
what
standards
they
are.
and
it
assumes,
it
assumes
that
our
argument
is
an
argument
for
mandatory
categories
which
would
take
compassion
out
of
the
system.
we
don’t
argue
for
that.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
have
your
honor
and
i
will
add
this.
there
are
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge,
475
men
on
death
row
at
this
moment
in
the
country,
470
of
them
were
sentence
by
juries
exercising
discretion
akin
to
or
in
some
way
like
arkansas.
the
decision
in
this
case
which
we
asked
for
would
vacate
or
lay
the
ground
for
vacating.
a
number
of
death
sentence
as
we
contend
are
unconstitutional.
the
governor
of
arkansas
has
14
men
on
death
row
whose
executions
he
has
held
out
pending
disposition
of
this
case.
this
court
has
before
it
petitions
for
certiorari
from
alabama,
from
new
jersey,
from
north
carolina,
from
california
raising
this
issue.
i
am
very
sensitive
to
the
notion
that
this
court
should
not
decide
constitutional
questions
prematurely.
but
if
eminent
death
of
dozens
of
people
can
make
an
issue
not
premature,
the
issues
presented
here
are
not
premature.
there
is
no
question
of
no
adversity,
there’s
enough
adversity
in
this
case
to
float
a
dozen
constitutional
issues.
there
is
not
enough.
there’s
no
question
here
of
an
unfocused
nature
of
the
issues.
the
issues
are
clearly
focused
and
the
question
is
presented
for
decision
we
suggest
that
for
this
court
to
put
up
on
speculation
of
witherspoon
or
something
else.
the
contention
between
this
parties
arkansas
contending
he
has
a
right
to
try
william
m.
maxwell
and
kill
him
without
standards
and
are
contending
that
for
eight,
the
better
part
is
six
years.
he’s
been
on
death
row
and
for
longer
than
that
under
jeopardy
of
death
under
an
unconstitutional
regime.
that’s
the
issue
we
put
this
court.
we
ask
this
court
to
decide
the
arkansas
procedure
is
unconstitutional
for
violation
of
the
rule
of
law
and
we
hope
that
it
will
reach
and
decide
the
issue
in
this
case.
thank
you.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
court
is
thoroughly
familiar
with
this
case,
which
has
been
the
subject
of
one
prior
oral
argument
here
and
a
briefing
--
voluminous
briefing
by
the
parties
and
various
amici
curiae.
as
i
see
the
matter,
there
are
at
this
time
four
questions
before
the
court.
the
first
two
are
the
questions
on
which
this
court
granted
certiorari
in
december
of
1968.
number
one,
whether
the
arkansas
practice
of
giving
its
juries
unlimited,
unguided,
and
unreviewable
power
to
sentence
persons
convicted
of
rape
to
live
or
die,
violates
the
rule
of
law
fundamental
to
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
two,
whether
the
arkansas
practice
of
trying
simultaneously,
in
a
capital
case
the
issues
of
guilt
and
of
punishment
also
violates
fourteenth
amendment.
those
are
the
questions
which
in
the
jargon
of
this
case
are
non-respectively
as
a
standards
issue
and
the
single
verdict
issue.
the
third
question
is
one
which
arises
from
this
court's
decision
in
boulden
versus
holman.
in
that
case
as
in
this
one,
a
state
prisoner
condemned
to
death,
brought
a
federal
habeas
corpus
proceeding.
in
the
course
of
which,
he
presented
no
client
prior
to
the
appearance
of
the
case
in
this
court,
challenging
the
selection
of
the
jury
that
condemned
him
to
die.
notwithstanding
that
issue
had
not
been
presented
in
the
lower
courts
and
is
not
included
in
the
application
for
certiorari
here,
this
court
held
that
it
could
notice
that
the
record
in
his
case
disclosed
a
violation
of
the
rule
of
witherspoon
versus
illinois,
in
the
process
by
which
jurors
had
been
death
qualified
in
the
selection
of
this
jury.
and
the
court
therefore,
vacated
and
remanded
the
case
to
the
district
court
for
further
consideration
of
that
witherspoon
client.
that
i
will
refer
to
in
this
case
as
to
witherspoon
issue.
the
fourth
question
presented
to
the
court
is
not
a
substantive
one.
it
is
simply
which
in
how
many
of
the
first
three
questions
this
court
will
address.
i
would
like,
if
i
may
to
begin
with
that
with
a
question,
unless
i
waste
the
court's
time.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
mr.
justice
harlan?
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
the
fourth
question
is
not
a
substantive
question,
mr.
justice
harlan.
it
is
which
of
the
first
three
the
court
ought
to
reach.
and
rather
than
launch
in
to
discussion
of
the
first
three,
i'd
like
to
talk
a
little
about
that
fourth.
now,
i
recognize
in
talking
about
the
fourth
that
this
is
uniquely
a
matter
for
the
judgment
and
for
the
discretion
of
this
court.
but
i
do
want
to
state
some
facts
that
i
think
it
is
important
that
the
court
know
in
exercising
that
discretion.
to
my
knowledge
there
are
somewhat
more
than
67
death
cases
pending
on
petitions
for
writs
of
certiorari
in
this
court.
in
the
past
weeks,
i
have
caused
examination
to
be
made
of
all
of
the
ones
that
we
could
identify,
and
we
have
examined
67.
there
are
45
cases,
out
of
that
67
coming
from
18
states,
which
present
either
the
standards
issue
or
the
split
verdict
issue.
to
be
specific,
the
standards
issue
is
presented
in
43
cases.
the
split
verdict
issue
is
presented
in
18.
again,
to
the
best
of
my
current
information,
there
are
presently
on
the
death
rows
in
this
country,
approximately
510
condemned
men.
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
maxwell
case
on
the
standards
issue,
would
potentially
affect
all
but
five
of
those
510
condemned
men,
that
is
better
than
500.
the
decision
of
this
court
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
no,
mr.
justice
stewart,
although
there
are
in
the
statute
books
of
several
states
mandatory
capital
crimes.
there's
only
one
active
mandatory
capital
crime
in
the
sense
that
people
are
being
tried
for,
there's
no
anybody
on
death
row
for
it.
the
five
people
to
whom
i
refer
are
five
california
convicts
who
are
presently
on
death
row,
because
of
conviction
of
a
crime,
which
carries
a
mandatory
death
penalty
(voice
overlap).
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
death
penalty
with
standards
are
mandatory
death
penalty.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
the
split
verdict
issue
would
potentially
effect
to
the
best
of
my
calculation
and
this
is
a
very
rough
one,
380
to
390
of
the
510
men
are
on
death
row.
and
this
mr.
justice
stewart
is
of
course
because
several
of
the
states,
including
those
with
the
major
death
row
populations,
such
as
california
have
split
verdict,
so
that
the
number
is
very
significantly
reduced.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge,
mr.
justice
brennan
five:
connecticut,
new
york,
california,
pennsylvania,
and
texas
has
it,
and
here's
what
causes
the
difficulty
in
my
figuring
out
how
many
men
are
involved.
texas
has
it,
but
only
put
it
in
recently,
so
that
some
people
on
death
row
in
texas
were
convicted
under
a
single
verdict
procedure.
texas
now
has
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
pardon
me?
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
new
york
put
it,
i
believe
as
a
result
of
the
interim
report
of
the
committee
whose
final
report
led
to
abolition
and
that
would
have
been
back
around
1965.
however,
there
are
very
few
people
on
death
row
in
new
york,
as
a
result
of
the
almost
total
abolition
now
of
the
death
penalty
in
that
state.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
it
was
--
i
think
that
the
split
verdict
for
capital
trials
wasn't
involved
in
spencer
there.
texas,
since
spencer
has
revised
both
the
procedure
for
recidivist
trials
and
the
procedure
for
sentencing
in
capital
cases.
the
one
other
area
that
i
think
i
want
to
bring
to
the
court's
attention,
in
connection
with
the
question
of
what
issues
it's
had
reached
comes
from
experience
of
about
five
years
in
dealing
with
these
cases.
prior
to
the
time
when
this
court
granted
review
in
maxwell
versus
bishop,
the
job
of
getting
stays
of
execution
for
condemned
men
was
an
incredibly
difficult,
perilous
job.
on
occasions,
courts
would
stay
executions.
occasionally,
we
would
have
to
come
to
the
justices
of
this
court
to
get
stays
of
execution
a
day,
two
days
before
the
execution
dates
were
set,
as
we
did
in
this
maxwell
case.
since
the
grant
of
review
in
maxwell
versus
bishop,
it
has
been
far
easier
to
get
courts
to
be
willing
to
stay
an
execution,
until
this
court
finally
disposed
of
the
issues
in
this
case.
and
the
question
of
getting
stays
of
execution
is
a
vital
one,
literally
of
course.
but
also
a
troublesome
one,
because
many
of
the
men
on
death
row
are
still
not
represented,
and
those
of
us
who
are
trying
to
represent
them
very
often
don't
learn,
until
the
last
minute
that
an
execution
date
has
been
set.
since
maxwell
v.
bishop
was
brought
before
this
court,
the
governors
of
several
states,
arkansas,
massachusetts,
washington,
have
agreed
to
hold
up
all
executions
in
the
state,
pending
decisions
of
these
issues
by
this
court.
however,
if
this
court
should
dispose
of
the
maxwell
versus
bishop
case
on
a
ground,
which
does
not
resolve
the
standards
and
the
single
verdict
issues,
and
if
it
does
not
simultaneously
grant
review
on
those
issues
in
one
of
the
other
pending
cases.
the
problem
of
getting
stays
of
execution
will
not
be
even
what
it
was
before
the
grant
of
review
in
maxwell
versus
bishop,
it
will
be
far
worst.
the
reason
for
that
is
this,
that
in
recent
years,
and
for
the
most
part,
since
the
grant
of
review
in
maxwell
versus
bishop,
the
highest
courts
of
17
states,
including
the
states
with
the
eight
largest
death
row
populations
in
this
country
have
rejected
the
standards
client.
there
are
on
the
death
rows
of
those
states
about
380
condemned
men.
and
the
claim
has
also
have
been
rejected
by
the
federal
courts
of
appeals
of
the
eighth,
ninth,
and
tenth
circuits
with
a
result
that
federal
stays
of
execution
in
habeas
corpus
would
also
not
likely
be
available.
the
standards
issue,
pardon
me,
split
verdict
issue
has
at
the
same
time
been
rejected
by
the
highest
courts
of
11
states,
having
about
220
men
on
their
death
rows.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
pardon
me?
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
all
but
13,
mr.
justice
harlan
and
of
course,
that
simply
a
pragmatic
answer,
that
is
i'm
not
treating
states,
which
have
it
for
treason,
but
don't
use
it
to
answer.
what
this
means
in
effect
is
that
if
ever
there
were
an
issue
of
grave
national
importance,
it
is
the
issue
presented
in
the
questions,
on
which
this
court
granted
review
in
this
case,
in
december
of
1968.
it
may
well
be
that
the
constitutional
contentions
raised
by
maxwell
and
by
these
other
condemned
men
are
not
going
to
be
sustained,
but
i
would
only
ask
that
this
court
pass
upon
those
issues
in
this
case
or
in
another
before
the
executions,
which
will
surely
follow.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
if
the
split
verdict
issue
and
not
the
standards
issue
were
decided
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
would
estimate
that
there
would
be
130
men
on
death
row
in
principally
three
states.
the
other
two
states
that
have
split
verdict
don't
have
very
many
men
on
death
row.
but
there
would
be
approximately
130
men
on
death
row
in
three
states,
who
would
still
go
to
their
death
with
the
issue
of
standards
unresolved.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
california,
which
has
85
--
90
men
on
death
row,
pennsylvania
which
has
20
men
on
death
row.
and
whatever
number
in
texas
were
tried
under
the
new
split
verdict
procedure.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
mr.
chief
justice,
i
am
asserting
only
that
the
constitution
compels
the
procedure
of
providing
standards
of
some
sort
to
guide
a
jury
in
its
discretion.
and
that
it
requires
some
form
of
trial,
not
necessarily
the
single
verdict
trial
in
fact
been
used
in
california
or
pennsylvania,
that's
a
matter
of
the
state
to
decide
what
procedure
it
wants
to
use.
but
that
the
constitution
requires
some
form
of
trial,
which
does
not
whipsaw
a
capital
defendant
between
his
privileges
against
self-incrimination,
and
his
right
to
provide
the
jury
with
adequate
information
to
make
an
informed
sentencing
choice.
i
want
to
make
that
very
plain
because
i
think
in
the
last
oral
argument,
i
failed
to
do
so,
and
i'm
not
at
all
clear
we've
done
so
in
the
briefs.
i
do
not
regard
this
case,
as
a
case
which
poses
any
newfangled
notions
of
due
process
or
any
notions
of
an
expanding,
collapsing
concept
to
due
process
into
which
i
am
asking
the
judges
of
this
court
to
pour
their
own
penological
judgments,
that
is
not
this
case,
and
that
is
not
this
kind
of
due
process.
the
kind
of
due
process
that's
involved
in
this
case
is
the
most
fundamental,
basic,
traditional,
classical
concept
of
due
process,
simply,
due
process
as
the
law
of
the
land,
in
the
meaning
of
magna
carta,
a
requirement
of
legality,
a
requirement
of
lawfulness.
and
mr.
chief
justice,
it
is
our
assertion
not
that
the
procedures
that
we
are
urging
are
better
procedures
or
more
humane
procedures,
or
even
more
beneficial
procedures
to
the
defendant.
several
points
have
been
made
on
several
occasions,
that
some
of
the
procedures
we're
arguing
for
might
be
worst
for
defendants.
defendants
who
have
worst
backgrounds
and
worst
histories,
would
be
worst
sought,
if
there
were
standards
which
what
the
juries
takes
those
things
into
a
cam.
i'm
not
standing
here
to
ask
for
something
here
better
for
defendants
or
worst
for
defendants,
or
more
humane,
or
a
better
of
way
of
doing
it.
what
the
constitution
requires
is
law.
it
requires
a
regularized
system
for
the
adjudication
of
issues
by
courts,
and
that
is
what
a
procedure
we
are
challenging
in
this
case
last.
now,
if
i
may
focus
in
on
that
procedure
and
talk
then
first
about
the
standards
question.
i
think
there
is
something
of
a
misconception
in
the
approach
to
the
jury
sentencing
in
capital
cases,
which
suggest
that
what
the
jury
is
doing
in
a
death
case
is
to
exercise
some
sort
of
clemency
or
mercy,
or
as
mr.
harris
called
it
in
the
last
argument
here,
compassion.
i
think
that
in
an
examination,
both
of
the
practice
in
arkansas
and
elsewhere.
and
if
the
statute
in
arkansas
and
elsewhere
makes
very
clear
that
the
claimed
of
determination
that
is
being
when
juries
choose
between
the
penalties
of
life
and
death.
it's
a
very
different
business
than
the
release
of
some
few
people
from
what
is
otherwise
a
mandatory
or
even
a
normal
punishment
for
the
offense
for
which
they
have
been
convicted.
what
the
statute
in
arkansas
does
is
not
to
make
death
“the
penalty”
for
a
rape.
it
is
not
to
make
death
the
penalty
for
any
in
all
varieties
of
rape
or
even
for
some
special
varieties
of
rape.
it
is
to
make
it
unavailable
penalty
with
an
equally
available
penalty
of
life
imprisonment.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
in
1915
mr.
justice
harlan,
that's
1915,
1-9-1-5.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
before
that
it
was
mandatory.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
yes
mr.
justice
stewart,
if
there
were
any
states
that
didn't
follow
that
course,
i
don't
know
of
them.
the
ordinary
practice
in
every
state
that
i
know
of
was
exactly
that,
that
after
the
mandatory
death
penalty
became
for
some
reason
intolerable
and
impossible
to
maintain,
legislatures
instead
of
attempting
to
define
subclasses
of
cases,
in
which
it
might
be
permissible
to
sentence
a
man
to
death,
simply
said
let
the
jury
have
it,
the
jury
can
decide.
and
it
is
--
i'm
talking
nothing
under
the
rug,
its
a
general
practice.
it
is
the
universal
practice
for
the
states
to
simply
turn
it
over
to
the
jury.
and
for
the
most
part,
this
is
a
twentieth
century
phenomena,
this
doesn't
go
back
much
further
than
that.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
that's
right.
the
difference
is
the
matters
of
detail.
the
matters
of
detail,
i
may
be
critical
for
constitutional
purpose,
such
as
the
detail
as
to
whether
or
not
the
judge
may
review
the
jury's
determination.
but
for
a
general
overall
description
of
the
kind
of
institution,
we're
talking
about.
we
are
talking
about
one
that
in
virtually
all
states
is
the
same
and
involves
exactly
the
process
that
your
honors
described.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
no,
your
honor,
there
is
jury
sentencing
in
non-capital
cases,
in
a
number
of
states.
i'm
not
a
student
of
this,
but
my
impression
is
that
they
are
largely
southern
states.
arkansas
is
one
such
state.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
oh!
my
belief
is
that
it
is,
but
i
would
not
be
sure
of
that.
there
is
a
parallel
development
mr.
justice
white.
it
is
true
in
penology
generally
that
the
law
has
moved
from
--
mandated
legislatively
fix
sentences
for
specified
crimes
to
a
range
of
sentences
available
for
the
crime.
now,
i'm
quite
sure
that
it
was
in
the
process
of
that,
the
juries
were
given
discretion
in
the
states,
in
which
they
now
have
it.
but
whether
it
came
earlier
later
than
the
development
in
capital
cases,
i'm
not
sure,
because
there's
so
many
other
devices
in
non-capital
cases
that
came
in
too.
giving
the
judge
a
range
of
sentences,
the
maximum,
minimum,
the
indeterminate
sentence,
all
of
those
things.
i'm
not
sure
historically
when
that
came
in.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
that's
right.
the
district
of
columbia
was
one
of
the
last
three
jurisdictions
in
this
country
to
have
a
mandatory
death
penalty.
again,
i'm
talking
about
a
mandatory
death
penalty
for
murder.
there's
still
some
mandatory
death
penalties
on
the
books
but
they
simply
are
not
used,
and
the
reason
they're
on
the
books
is
that
it's
not
being
used.
there'd
been
no
pressure
to
take
them
off.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
let
me
put
it
this
way
mr.
chief
justice,
i
have
no
hesitation
in
contending
that
anytime
that
a
legislature
gives
a
jury
completely
arbitrary
power
to
single
out
from
among
the
total
number
of
people
convicted
of
any
crime.
some
who
will
live,
and
some
who
will
die
without
standards
for
that
determination,
without
guidelines,
and
it
does
violate
the
constitution.
but,
i
could
see
a
distinction
being
drawn
between
crimes.
i
do
--
i
would
not
drag,
but
i
would
urge
that
in
this
case,
the
case
of
rape,
you
have
a
somewhat
easier
case
than
you
do
a
first-degree
murder.
and
the
reason
for
that
is
that
the
amount
of
discretion
that
may
be
tolerable.
i
keep
saying
discretion;
it
isn't
discretion
in
any
legal
sense.
the
amount
of
raw
naked
power
to
take
a
life
or
save
a
life
that
can
be
given
may
depend
on
the
range
of
cases,
within
which
the
jury
can
exercise
it.
now,
what
is
rape?
is
a
very
broad
range
of
offenses,
it
ranges
from
anything
from
a
fellow
and
a
girl,
who
had
been
going
together,
getting
into
a
situation,
and
he
going
too
far
over
resistance
to
a
brutal
beating
of
a
child
with
permanent
physical
injury
or
torture
rape
or
something
like
that.
it's
just
a
tremendous
range
of
factual
situations
encompassed
within
the
notion
of
rape.
so
that
the
idea
that
the
offensive
rape
sets
any
limitation
or
gives
guidance
to
the
jury,
is
just
totally
(inaudible).
there
are
within
the
total
gambit
of
cases
in
which
convictions
of
rape
come
down,
an
infinite
variety
of
factual
circumstances.
now,
the
theory
seems
to
be
that
the
jury
somehow,
that
12
men
brought
off
the
street,
who
have
never
sentenced
anybody
else,
and
will
never
sentence
anybody
else
again,
who
have
no
way
of
making
the
judgment
that
they
pass
in
this
case
consistent
with
the
judgment
that's
been
passed
or
will
be
passed
on
any
other
human
being
convicted
of
this
crime,
that
they
somehow
will
look
at
all
the
facts
of
this
case
come
out
with
circumstances
that
warrant
the
death
penalty
and
impose
it.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
yes
it
is
vastly,
vastly
different.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
am
talking
also,
mr.
chief
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
yes,
the
function
is
vastly
different
and
explicitly
stated
by
california
and
arkansas
to
be
different.
when
a
jury
passes
on
a
question
of
negligence,
they
go
in
and
they
hear
the
evidence
on
both
sides.
and
the
judge
said
to
them,
“ladies
and
gentlemen
in
the
jury,
if
you
find
that
the
defendant
failed
to
exercise
toward
the
plaintiff,
that
amount
of
care
that
a
reasonable
man
would
have
exercised,
you
must
find
for
the
plaintiff.”
now,
of
course
reasonable
man
is
a
standard,
which
is
not
as
specific
as
section
3355
of
the
revenue
code,
but
it
does
direct
the
jury's
attention
to
an
issue.
it
is
a
very
different
question
from
saying
to
the
jury
if
you
find
that
the
plaintiff
should
win
this
case,
you
should
find
for
the
plaintiff.
at
least,
telling
them
that
the
defendant
must
exercise
care,
which
a
reasonable
man
would
exercise,
let's
them
go
back
and
talk
about
something,
one
juror
can
say
to
another
juror,
“well,
what
is
the
amount
of
care
that
in
this
particular
automobile
case,
a
reasonable
man
would
have
exercised?”
it
is
more
than
the
amount
of
care
that
has
to
be
exercise
with
regard
to
a
trespasser
and
less
than
the
amount
of
care
that
has
to
be
exercised
with
regard
to
--
for
example
somebody
to
whom
you
owe
a
special
duty
of
care.
the
whole
up
is
based
on
making
those
kinds
of
distinctions,
and
the
fact
that
not
anyone
of
them
will
bring
you
out,
computer-like
to
a
conclusion,
doesn't
mean
that
there
aren't
standards
involved
there.
when
the
jury
goes
out
to
talk
about
the
death
penalty
in
a
rape
case
in
arkansas,
they
can't
ask
whether
or
not
it's
reasonable
to
impose
a
death
penalty
or
anything
else,
when
juror
may
vote
for
the
death
penalty,
because
the
defendant
was
black
and
the
victim
was
white.
and
i
think
this
is
a
very
important
matter
also
in
describing
the
function
mr.
chief
justice.
it
would
shock
me
and
it
would
demonstrate,
i
think
that
our
entire
court
system
is
not
functioning
at
all.
if
you
did
a
study
of
cases
in
which
plaintiffs
had
sued
defendants
and
juries
had
come
up
with
a
verdict,
in
negligence
cases.
and
you
found
that
there
was
no
correlation,
whatever,
ascertainable
between
the
facts
of
the
case
and
the
juries
verdicts.
i
think
that
you
would
find
and
inevitably
find
that
the
higher
the
rate
the
speed
of
the
car
with
which
the
defendant
hit
the
plaintiff
or
the
murkier
than
night
on
which
it
was
occurring,
or
the
worst
of
breaks
the
more
you're
going
to
find
plaintiffs
recovering
the
defendants.
such
a
study
was
done
in
arkansas.
three
factors
emerged
that
characterized
the
cases,
in
which
persons
get
the
death
penalty:
race,
the
commission
of
contemporaneous
offense,
a
prior
record
of
imprisonment.
a
prior
record
of
imprisonment
may
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
jury's
determination
rationally
of
it,
because
a
jury
ordinarily
doesn't
know
about
a
prior
record.
so
that
i
think
that
both
in
legal
theory
and
in
fact,
this
is
a
very
different
business
from
the
juries
going
out
and
in
a
negligence
case
in
saying,
“well,
did
that
defendant
have
a
duty
of
care?
what
was
that
duty
of
care?
did
he
act
the
way
a
reasonable
man
would
act?”
in
arkansas,
none
of
those
questions
need
to
be
asked,
and
in
performance
the
juries
do
very
different
things.
in
the
one
case
the
jury
acts
consistently
with
a
pattern,
a
system
defined
by
law
and
ordained
by
law,
and
in
death
sentencing
juries
act
simply,
except
for
the
factor
of
race,
irrationally.
now,
the
question
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
mr.
justice
harlan
this
is
one
of
those
questions
of
history
that
turn
on
what
your
personal
point
of
view
is.
i
would
put
it
this
way
from
my
personal
point
of
view
that
it
became
simply
intolerable
for
society
to
uniformly
sentence
to
death,
the
total
number
of
people
convicted
of
any
offense.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
no
there
isn't,
there
is
not.
it
simply
--
we
know
as
a
phenomenon
that
at
some
point
of
time,
legislatures
in
large
numbers
began
to
take
the
mandatory
death
penalty
off
the
book
and
replace
it
with
the
discretionary
form.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
no,
mr.
justice
black
our
argument
would
be
vastly
different.
what
arkansas
had
prior
to
allowing
jury's
discretion
was
a
mandatory
death
sentence
for
all
persons
convicted
of
a
crime.
now,
mandatory
death
sentences
would
raise
serious
constitutional
questions,
but
they
are
not
the
constitutional
questions
of
this
case.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
think
they
would
raise
a
very
serious
question
--
i'm
sorry.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
think
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
there
may
be
procedural
questions,
but
in
terms
of
the
major
question,
i
think
cruel
and
unusual
is
the
only
question
that
it
might
raise.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
no,
you
would
not.
you
wouldn't
have
two
issues
to
try,
so
you
wouldn't
have
a
single
verdict
issue,
you'd
only
have
a
single
issue
and
of
course
there's
no
discretion.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
quite
agree.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
that's
very,
very
difficult
to
say.
i
cannot
say
that
courts
have
exercised
judicial
review
of
a
death
sentence
in
more
than
11
or
12
jurisdictions.
now,
there
are
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
arkansas
has
its
statute,
it's
been
pointed
out,
it's
4323-10,
i
believe.
in
arkansas,
which
says
and
this
is
common
in
united
states,
this
is
where
i
have
to
give
an
uncertain
answer.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
no,
there
you
have
to
distinguish
between
trial
judges
and
appellate
judges
(voice
overlap).
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
trial
judges?
i
would
guess
eight
to
ten
states.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
yes.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
a
relatively
recent
innovation
and
it
takes
three
different
forms,
which
one
has
to
watch
out
for,
but
i
don't
think
they
make
much
difference.
one
is
that
the
judges
charge,
this
is
the
maryland
situation,
a
judge
is
charged
with
actually
passing
the
sentence
when
the
jury
has
made
a
recommendatory
body,
but
as
a
matter
of
practice,
the
judge
almost
fall
as
a
jury.
the
only
known
version,
a
very
recent
thing
is
that
judge
and
jury
must
concur,
that
it
puts
the
initial
on
a
signboard.
they
both
independently
and
infuriately
have
to
come
out
with
a
judgment.
then
the
third
is
a
form
that's
a
little
older,
but
still
i
think
largely
a
recent
innovation,
that
says
if
the
judge
may
set
aside
a
jury
verdict,
even
though
he
finds
no
error
in
it,
but
if
he
simply
disagrees
with
the
penalty
imposed.
now,
it's
the
latter
form
that
is
very
difficult
to
determine
by
head
count.
how
many
states
have,
because
there
are
number
of
states,
which
for
example
arkansas
has
a
statute
that
seems
to
give
a
judge
the
power
to
reduce
jury
sentences?
now,
it's
couched
in
language
that
i
do
not
think
it
applies
to
capital
cases.
there
has
never
been
a
case,
in
which
the
arkansas
supreme
court
had
said
that
it
implies
to
capital
cases.
and
in
the
last
argument
here,
counsel
for
the
state
say
he
knew
of
no
cases
in
which
a
judge
ever
done
that.
and
i
made
inquiry
of
arkansas
counsel,
and
we
know
of
no
case,
in
which
the
judges
ever
done
it.
so,
i
would
deny
that
in
arkansas,
there
is
such
a
thing.
but
one
couldn't,
by
looking
at
the
statute
books
of
the
states
come
out
with.
the
general
practice
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
am
confident
is
that
there
is
no
judicial
review.
in
some
states,
we
know
there
is.
in
california,
we
know
there
is.
not
by
statute
but
because
the
california
supreme
court
said
so.
but
in
most
jurisdictions,
i
would
think
there
was
not.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
it
certainly
does
mr.
chief
justice
and
indeed
my
whole
position
is
that
they
ought
to
do
that.
i'm
not
suggesting
for
one
moment
that
this
court
ought
to
set
standards
or
that
this
court
ought
to
review
any
legislative
judgment.
no
legislative
judgment
has
been
made,
except
the
legislative
judgment
that
no
judgment
can
be
made.
and
i
am
asking
this
court
to
determine
whether
it
is
consistent
with
the
rule
of
law,
which
is
fundamental
to
due
process
for
the
legislatures
to
say,
we
are
going
to
kill
people
and
we
are
not
going
to
undertake
an
investigation
to
determine
which
classes
of
people
should
live,
and
which
classes
of
people
should
die.
we're
not
going
to
set
down
rules,
we're
simple
going
to
let
a
jury
determine
like
rolling
the
dice,
which
person
is
going
to
live
and
which
person
is
going
to
die.
i
concede
the
benefits
of
legislative
judgment
view
and
a
ruling
by
this
court,
that
lawlessness
in
the
process
of
killing
people
is
unconstitutional
will
precisely
put
back
to
the
legislature
the
kind
of
question
that
it
is
uniquely
fitted
to
deal
with.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
it
is
indeed
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
(voice
overlap)
question,
but
the
courts
review
of
that
question
is
a
different
matter
than
reviewing
a
legislature's
judgment
as
to
standards,
because
neither
facts?
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
no,
i'm
not
sure
that
the
legislature
has
made
that
judgment.
i'm
not
sure
that
the
legislature
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
am
asking
this
court
to
say
that
standards
are
imperatively
required
under
the
constitution,
but
i'm
not
asking
you
to
review
a
judgment
of
a
legislature
that
standards
are
not
practicable,
which
is
i
thought
the
question
your
honor
asked.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
no,
no,
i
think
in
terms
of
what
least
left,
your
honor
later,
yes
i
think
that
the
legislatures
do
have
a
fairly
large
blank
check.
i
have
no
doubt
about
that.
the
primary
power
of
a
legislature
to
fix
sentences
or
offenses
is
a
very
broad
check
constitutionally,
there's
no
doubt
about
that.
this
court
has
a
very
limited
review
over
what
legislatures
do
in
determining
sentences,
as
is
it
a
very
limited
review
over
the
penological
judgment,
same
i
can
define
in
crimes.
the
only
power
that
this
court
has
to
enforce
the
constitution
and
the
only
that
i'm
asserting
the
constitution
requires
is
a
rule
of
law.
and
i
do
not
think
that
this
court
is
being
asked
thereby
to
review
any
legislative
judgments,
and
standards
are
not
practicable.
in
the
absence
of
somebody
asserting
to
a
legislature
that
they're
desirable
or
necessary,
we
don't
even
really
know
that
any
legislature
has
made
the
judgment
that
they're
impractical.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
mr.
chief
justice,
i
agree
with
that
and
i
will
admit
that
i
will
probably
be
among
the
people,
who
will
be
up
here
asserting
that.[laughter]
but
i
don't
think
that
that
is
the
question
as
before
the
court.
this
court
back
in
the
early
1930s
had
the
question
of
whether
or
not
a
city,
which
wanted
to
control
parading
on
its
streets.
it
could
simply
say,
“you
got
to
get
a
permit
from
the
chief
of
police.
it's
illegal
to
parade
without
a
permit,
get
a
permit,
and
you
can
parade.”
now
of
course,
it
was
a
fact
that
if
this
court
said,
“well,
standards
are
required
for
the
issuance
of
a
permit
that
25
years
or
30
years
of
litigation,
which
we
have
had
would
ensue
with
regard
to
what
the
kind
of
standards
should
be.”
now,
i
don't
know
how
much
litigation
is
going
ensue
from
a
decision
requiring
standards.
but
i
do
know
that
the
only
question
before
the
court
at
this
point
is
a
question
was
before
the
court
back
in
1930
in
the
permit
case,
whether
any
kinds
of
standards
are
required.
a
legislature
may
do
a
very
good
job,
and
this
court
may
be
able
to
decide
within
a
year
or
two
years
that
the
standards
which
have
been
defined
are
adequate.
it
may
do
a
very
bad
job,
and
certainly
the
standards
will
be
challengeable.
it
is
a
very
function
of
the
rule
of
law
that
have
things
that
can
be
tested
legally,
that's
what
we
don't
now
have
and
that's
what
we're
contending.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
would
regard
that
as
a
standard
and
far
better
than
what
arkansas
has,
but
i
would
not
regard
it
as
an
adequate
standard.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
no
i
don't
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
have
indeed,
and
i
do.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
believe
that
the
court
will
not
be
setting
its
foot
on
a
primrose
path,
if
it
demands
that
the
states
set
some
standards
for
the
penalty
determination.
i
believe
that
statutes
are
draftable,
which
will
provide
adequate
constitutional
standards.
i
say
that
in
view
of
two
major
considerations.
first,
i
think
we
already
had
some
models.
i
think
that
the
ali
model
penal
code,
model
for
a
capital
punishment
statute,
although
i
might
not
agree
with
all
of
its
details
is
a
workable
model.
secondly,
again
i'd
like
to
advert,
if
i
may
to
the
history
of
the
court's
experience
in
dealing
with
ordinances,
it
regulates
parades
in
that
certain
time.
i
think
it
might
have
been
arguable,
and
it
might
have
looked
very
plausible
before
this
court's
decision
in
1938
in
lovell
and
griffin,
to
say
that
you
could
not
draft
an
ordinance,
that
would
take
account
of
all
of
the
imponderables
that
had
to
do
with
the
question
of
whether
or
not
you
would
let
a
parade
go
down
the
street.
you
have
to
worry
about
traffic,
you
have
to
worry
about
crowd
control,
you
have
to
worry
about
the
availability
of
police,
you
have
to
worry
about
emergency
vehicles,
you
have
to
worry
about
a
thousand
contingencies.
nevertheless,
it
was
not
three
years
after
this
court's
decision
in
lovell
versus
griffin,
requiring
standards,
that
this
court
sustained
a
statute
as
a
having
standards
in
cox
in
new
hampshire
in
1941.
and
the
fact
that
there's
been
30
years
of
experience
in
which
this
court
has
had
to
knock
down
various
ordinances
for
lack
of
standards
it's
not
because
it
was
impossible
to
draft
standards,
but
simply
because
there
was
a
willful
refusal
to
comply
with
what
this
court
demand.
and
i
say
willful
advisably,
because
the
considerations
that
kept
open-handed
discretion
in
the
hands
of
police
chiefs
to
regulate
parades
is
very
much
the
same
thing
that
is
being
given
to
juries
in
capital
punishment.
there
is
simply
feeling
that
if
you
really
brought
up
to
the
surface
and
articulated
the
considerations
that
the
legislature
was
attending
to
effect
juries,
like
race,
they
wouldn't
stand
the
light
of
debt.
now,
i
think
that
it
is
possible
to
draft
a
statute,
which
will
withstand
the
constitutional
scrutiny
of
this
court.
and
i
think
that
insistence
by
this
court
that
the
legislature
address
itself,
tearing
its
undoubtedly
greater
wisdom,
and
it's
undoubtedly
more
appropriate
penological
judgment
to
that
question
will
advance,
the
cause
of
the
drafting
of
adequate
statutes.
i
think
that
if
this
court
hadn't
decided
in
lovell
and
griffin
that
it
was
necessary,
the
legislatures
never
would
have
caught.
now,
that
they've
tired,
they've
succeeded.
i
think
that
if
this
court
insist
that
the
rule
of
law
requires
the
drafting
of
standards
in
this
area,
that
it
will
be
possible
to
do,
and
i
think
that
the
model
penal
code,
although
i
have
some
questions
about
details
of
it,
and
although
it's
applicable
to
murder
and
not
to
rape
is
a
fair
example
of
what
legislatures
can
do
if
they
try.
now,
there
is
--
though
i
think
a
second
answer
to
that
question.
if
i
were
to
conclude
that
it
was
impossible
to
draft
a
statute
which
would
impose
the
rule
of
law
on
a
decision,
whether
or
not
men
should
live
or
die.
so,
that
it
was
impossible
to
reconcile
the
basic
requirement
of
lawfulness
in
proceedings
with
the
death
penalty,
i
have
no
doubt
which
of
the
two
institutions,
the
constitution
say
should
prevail.
if
the
cause
of
a
system
of
capital
punishment
is
lawlessness
in
its
administration,
the
constitution
forbids
that
kind
of
lawlessness.
and
that
causes
me
to
revert
to
what
i
think
is
essentially
wrong
with
arkansas'
procedure
for
determining
who
lives
and
who
dies
in
a
capital
case.
that
is
a
decision,
as
i
have
said
which
is
not
the
dispensation
of
mercy.
on
this
record
it
appears
that
less
than
a
quarter
of
the
total
number
of
persons
convicted
of
a
crime
of
rape
are
sentenced
to
death,
and
that
appears
to
be
a
very
high
figure.
the
general
statistics
that
are
available,
and
we
put
them
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief
and
they
have
a
great
deal
of
trouble
analytically,
but
nevertheless
one
can
draw
some
implications
from
it,
the
general
statistics
that
are
available
appear
to
show
that
not
more
than
10%
of
people
convicted
of
capital
rape
were
in
fact
sentenced
to
die,
and
that
for
murder,
it
may
be
up
in
a
neighborhood
of
20%.
now,
the
process
by
which
jurors
take,
out
of
all
the
persons
convicted
of
a
like
harm,
one-tenth
or
one-fifth
of
those
persons
and
subject
them
to
the
most
extreme
penalty
known
to
our
law
has
got
to
be
under
the
constitution
i
submit,
a
rational,
regular,
and
lawful
process.
i
do
not
think
that
this
court
for
one
moment
would
sustain
a
state
enactment
of
a
statute
that
said
that
out
of
every
five
persons
convicted
of
murder,
and
out
of
every
ten
persons
convicted
of
rape,
they
shall
meet
in
the
state
penitentiary
and
draw
straws
to
see
who
will
die.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
think
this
is
worst
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
yes
it
is,
because
there
it
is
every
bit
as
arbitrary
in
that,
the
factors
which
determine
whether
or
not
a
person
lives
or
dies.
although
there
are
subject
to
the
appraisal
of
a
particular
jury
rather
than
a
straw
or
the
dice
are
not
subject
to
that
jury's
consideration
in
light
of
any
rules
that
are
applied
in
this
case
and
the
next.
there
is
no
assurance
that
what
makes
this
jury
sentence
this
man
to
death
pick
him
from
nine
or
ten
other
people
exactly
like
it,
responds
to
any
rule
applied
at
any
other
ends
case,
where
there
it
will
be
applied
in
any
other
man's
case.
and
what's
worst
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
mr.
justice
black,
i
don't
think
one
can
fairly
draw
that
inference,
and
i'll
tell
you
two
reasons
why
i
think
one
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
because
we
have
examined
that
factors
that
bring
about
death
verdicts
in
the
state
of
arkansas,
and
we
have
not
found
in
any
of
the
characteristics
that
you
or
i
or
twelve
jurors
could
agree,
made
those
cases,
bad
cases,
in
fact,
bring
about
the
death
verdict.
what
we
found
is,
if
there
are
three
factors
that
show
up
in
death
cases
as
this
thing,
which
from
my
cases,
race,
prior
imprisonment
which
the
jury
doesn't
know
about,
unless
the
defendant
forgoes
this
privilege
and
takes
the
stand;
and
commission
of
a
contemporaneous
offense,
which
didn't
happen
in
maxwell's
case.
so,
that
i
think
that
if
you
examined
the
performance
of
juries,
you
must
conclude
that
they
are
not
in
fact,
reserving
the
death
penalty
for
the
most
serious
kinds
of
offenses
or
a
particularly
bad
kind
of
offense.
they
are
applying
it
in
fact,
in
light
of
those
factors
randomly,
exactly
the
way
a
roll
of
the
dice
would.
but
what
they
are
doing
is
worst
than
that,
because
the
dice
at
least
don't
discriminate
racially
in
arkansas
juries
do.
at
least
with
the
dice,
a
black
man
would
have
an
even
chance
of
getting
the
death
penalty
with
a
white
male.
and
in
fact
in
arkansas,
50%
of
the
black
chart
of
interracial
rate
get
the
death
penalty
and
14%
of
persons
charged
with
intra-racial
case
get
the
death
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
they're
not
of
record
mr.
justice
black.
we
have
put
in
our
brief
however,
every
statistic
that
has
ever
been
produced,
which
the
court
can't
properly,
judicially
notice,
and
everyone
points
to
the
same
conclusion.
we
have
other
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
pardon
me,
mr.
justice?
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i'm
talking
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
oh!
i
think
it
does
mr.
justice
black.
i
think
it
enters
into
the
matters
in
all
of
the
states.
and
that's
exactly
why
we
argue
for
a
constitutional
ruling,
it's
applicable
to
all
the
states.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
would
say
that
the
constitution
forbids
arbitrary
discretion
in
the
hands
of
the
judge,
as
it
does
with
the
jury.
but,
again
i
can
see
a
distinction
between
the
two
cases,
and
i
believe
that
a
holding
with
regard
to
juries
would
not
necessarily
apply
with
regard
to
judges.
again,
i
do
not
think
that
giaccio
versus
pennsylvania,
which
says
that
a
jury
can't
have
an
utterly
freehand
in
setting
cost.
it
means
that
the
judge
doesn't
have
a
freehand
in
setting
cost
in
cases.
i
think
that
the
fact
that
you
have
12
men
brought
in
for
a
particular
occasion,
who
are
not
professional
sentencers,
who
do
not
have
even
the
consistency
of
their
own
performance
from
case
to
case
to
guide
them
creates
a
different
background
for
the
exercise
of
that
discretion,
and
therefore,
it
may
be
constitutionally
impermissible
to
give
it
a
jury,
but
not
to
a
judge.
my
own
view
that
it's
equally
bad
to
give
it
to
a
judge,
but
i
don't
think
that
issue
is
presented
in
this
case.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
the
rule
for
which
we're
contending
in
this
case
is
limited
to
capital
cases.
again,
i
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
on
several
grounds,
the
most
significant
one,
i
think
is
simply
that,
where
more
is
at
stake
for
the
defendant,
the
requirements
of
due
process
for
a
regularized
decision-making
procedure
are
more
exact
then.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
no,
i
quite
agree,
but
there
we
have
a
first
amendment
concern,
as
well.
i
think
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
mr.
justice
white,
i
--
my
own
personal
position
again
would
be
that
standards
are
required
of
juries
and
of
judges
in
non-capital
sentencing
under
the
constitution.
but
i
think
that
since
skinner
and
oklahoma,
it
has
been
cleared
that
this
court
has
drawn
a
distinction.
in
skinner,
the
court
said
that
you
couldn't
sterilize
thieves,
unless
you
sterilize
embezzlers.
now,
nobody
has
ever
argued
that
you
can't
punish
theft
by
15
years
of
imprisonment,
and
punish
embezzlement
by
10.
those
kinds
of
penological
judgments
are
simply
of
a
different
order
of
magnitude
in
the
choice
of
life
or
death,
and
the
court
has
required
different
degrees
of
regularity
in
the
procedures,
and
even
handedness
in
the
procedures
from
posing
the
penalties.
a
second
consideration
and
i
think
is
vitally
important
is
this
one.
when
you
are
talking
about
non-capital
sentences,
you
have
a
consideration
that
just
doesn't
enter
into
the
equation,
when
you
talk
about
capital
sentences,
that
the
rehabilitative
aspects.
now,
i
am
not
ascertain,
i'll
make
this
very
clear
that
the
constitution
requires
that
states
take
rehabilitation
into
account,
in
their
sentencing.
but
i
am
asserting
that
inevitably
states
do
take
rehabilitation
into
account,
for
a
simple
fact
that
if
you
send
a
fellow
away
to
prison,
he's
going
to
come
out,
and
everybody
wants
to
come
out,
better
of
it
than
worse
from
the
point
of
view
of
society.
now,
we
simply
do
not
have
the
calibers
of
this
stage
of
a
science
to
reduce
the
rehabilitation
factor
to
categorical
judgments,
which
permit
themselves
to
be
articulated
in
standards.
when
you
make
the
decision,
however,
to
sentence
a
man
to
die,
instead
of
to
live,
you're
making
a
decision,
to
take
him
out
of
the
rehabilitative
regime
entirely.
and
that
kind
of
standard
it
seem
to
me,
can't
barrel
the
benefits
of
what
we
don't
know
about
rehabilitation.
so
i
think
that
again,
non-capital
sentencing
has
a
factor,
it
has
a
wild
card,
it
has
a
joke
that
justifies
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
no
i
don't
--
again,
mr.
justice
white,
i
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
think
that
it's
of
a
rational
line
to
draw,
that
the
court
could
say
that
where
rehabilitation
is
an
issue,
that
a
great
deal
of
torments
will
be
allowed
because
of
the
imprecision
of
the
art
of
sentencing
and
the
right
of
rehabilitation.
my
own
view
is
not
that,
but
i
think
it's
a
logical
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
it
would
be
midway
between
due
care
and
what
we
have
in
capital
sentencing,
because
at
least
the
focus
would
be
on
something
rehabilitation,
and
that's
exactly
what
is
wrong
with
the
arkansas
procedure.
it
is
unclear,
whether
a
jury
which
goes
back,
unclear
to
anyone
of
those
called
jurors,
whether
he
is
to
take
for
example
the
possible
reformation
of
the
defendant
into
a
capital
deciding
whether
he
shall
live
or
die.
it
is
perfectly
consistent
for
one
jury
to
ask
himself
the
question,
“well,
is
this
man
rehabilitative?
we're
going
to
sentence
him
to
death
only,
if
he's
not.”
another
juror
might
go
back
and
simply
ask
the
question,
“is
he
black,
and
was
he's
victim
white?”
another
one
might
go
back
and
ask
the
question,
“is
this
a
particularly
heinous
case
of
rape
in
one
sense
or
another?”
the
legislature
hasn't
even
focus
in
on
what
the
genuine
purpose
of
capital
punishment,
so
that
the
jurors
can
talk
meaningfully
about
it.
and
jurors
from
case
to
case
can
act
meaningfully
in
light
of,
some
general
purpose
for
capital
punishment.
now,
the
black-white
business
has
one
additional
very
important
factor,
a
very
important
implication
in
this
case
that
emerges
from
this
court's
decision
in
pearce
versus
north
carolina.
pearce
is
a
decision
in
which
this
court
has
required
standards
for
sentencing,
where
a
particular
kind
of
danger
was
perceived,
and
that
was
the
danger
that
a
judge
viewing
of
the
defendant's
access
on
appeal
with
this
favor
would
be
vindictive
and
penalizing
for
that.
it
would
to
me
be
an
anomaly
of
a
highest
degree
if
this
court
were
willing
to
exact
the
more
demanding
requirement
of
pearce,
not
simply
that
there'll
be
standards
for
the
decision,
but
the
reasons
for
the
application
of
those
standards
be
articulated.
where
the
risk
is
--
and
although
i
think
there
is
a
risk,
i
think
it's
not
a
terribly
great
one,
that
a
judge
would
be
vindictive,
and
not
to
require
standards,
where
the
danger
is
that
a
person
will
be
sentenced
to
death
on
account
of
his
race,
where
in
arkansas
specifically
and
in
this
country
generally,
everybody
who
has
examined
this
question
has
concluded,
that
in
fact
jurors
are
racially
discriminating
in
the
imposition
of
the
death
penalty.
but
danger
of
that,
of
a
flagrant
and
otherwise
unprevalent
violation
of
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
constitution,
should
require
this
court
to
assure
that
the
procedure
comes
up
to
visibility,
in
a
way
in
which
that
racial
factor
will
not
have
the
effect
that
we
know
it
now
has
in
capital
sentence.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
yes,
mr.
justice
white
for
two
reasons.
first
of
all,
i
am
not
only
talking
about
the
kind
of
discrimination
that
occurs
from
perverse
and
willful
disregard
of
a
legal
requirement.
in
arkansas,
a
juror
might
believe
that
it
is
legal
and
permissible
and
the
charge
he's
given
to
take
account
of
the
fact
that
the
defendant
is
black
and
the
victim
is
white,
and
that
at
least
would
be
flushed
out.
jurors
would
not
openly
be
able
to
say
to
each
other,
“let
us
sentence
this
man
to
death,
because
he
was
black
and
his
victim
as
white.”
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
think
that
any
instruction
would
help.
i
think
that
an
instruction
to
that
effect
would
help,
but
then
we
get
into
the
second
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
no,
i
think
it
would
not.
and
the
reason
for
that
is
this,
i
think
the
juries
may
well
discriminate
on
account
of
race
and
find
the
defendant
is
guilty
of
crimes,
as
well
as
you
convict
him,
but
there
all
sorts
of
judicial
methods
of
control
that
are
available
there,
that
are
not
available
in
the
absence
of
standards.
the
only
way
in
which
a
judge
can
determine,
whether
there's
a
rational
basis
in
the
record,
whether
the
jury
could
have
decided
to
impose
a
death
penalty
on
this
case,
on
any
other
ground
than
race,
is
if
there's
some
standards.
there
is
no
doubt
that
if
all
the
other
factors,
which
allowed
the
imposition
of
the
death
penalty,
under
appropriate
standards
existed
in
the
case,
the
jury
might
still
discriminate
on
account
of
race,
as
they
may
now
in
finding
guilt,
if
the
evidence
is
insufficient
to
make
out
all
of
the
elements
of
the
crime.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
am
afraid
my
time
is
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
mr.
chief
justice
i
thank
you
and
i
shall.
i
simply
would
want
to
imply
whether
there's
also
any
purpose
in
my
addressing
myself
to
the
witherspoon
point.
i
think
witherspoon
is
open
and
shut
on
this
record,
and
i
would
prefer
to
--
unless
the
court
has
questions
in
connection
with
witherspoon,
simply
pretermit
discussion
of
that.
seven
jurors
were
excluded
they
are
pretty
(voice
overlap)
witherspoon.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
fine.
now,
again
with
regard
with
the
split
verdict
issue,
i
want
to
make
very
clear
that
we
are
not
relying
on
some
general
notion
of
fairness,
which
is
to
be
spelled
out
in
due
process
clause
of
the
constitution.
we
are
relying
in
this
case
on
what
i
think
is
a
palpable
inconsistency
between
the
federally
protected
privilege
against
self-incrimination
of
the
defendant,
and
is
equally
protected
set
of
federal
constitutional
rights
in
assuring
a
rational
sentencing
decision.
those
latter
rights
include:
right
to
a
hearing
on
a
question
which
is
as
considerable
as
the
question
of
life
or
death,
and
the
opportunity
to
present
defensive
evidence
addressed
to
that
question.
now
in
a
single
verdict
trial,
a
defendant
who,
like
william
maxwell,
exercises
his
constitutional
privilege
against
self-incrimination
allows
the
jury
to
decide
whether
he
shall
live
or
die,
without
presenting
a
slightest
bit
of
evidence
relevant
to
the
choice
of
life
or
death,
except
the
evidence
that
comes
in
on
the
guilt
issue.
now
again,
i
am
not
asserting
and
it
is
not
the
basis
of
our
constitutional
submission
that
a
state
is
constitutionally
precluded
from
permitting
the
decision
as
to
life
or
death
to
be
made
on
the
facts
of
the
offence
if
the
state
does
that,
but
the
state
of
arkansas
does
not
do
that.
it
is
very
clear
that
the
state
of
arkansas
permits
the
decision
as
to
life
or
death
to
be
made
on
a
broad
basis,
including
background
information,
and
any
other
material
that
may
in
the
unfetter
discretion
of
the
jury
affects
it's
choice.
now
this
means
that
a
defendant
is
paid
a
very
high
price
for
giving
up
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
if
he
chooses
either
to
plead
guilty
and
limit
the
trial
to
the
issue
of
punishment
or
to
take
the
stand,
raise
all
of
the
question
of
background,
talk
to
the
jurors,
show
them
that
he
is
a
human
being,
show
them
that
he
has
a
voice,
explain
what
led
him
to
what
he
did,
and
asked
for
mercy,
in
light
of
those
considerations.
he
stands
a
far
better
chance
that
the
decision
will
be
made
on
a
full
and
rational
basis,
than
if
he
is
simply
exercises
his
privilege
and
does
not
testify.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i'm
sorry
mr.
justice
harlan
we
do
see
the
right
of
allocution
as
sort
of
a
comprehensive
summary
of
what
we
think
the
constitution
entitles
the
defendant
to
any
capital
case.
again,
we
quarrel
with
the
observations
of
this
court
in
hill
that
in
certain
kinds
of
cases,
allocution
may
not
arise
in
constitutional
dimensions.
what
we
say
is
that
in
a
capital
case,
where
allocution
has
been
historically
recognized
as
far
more
significant,
where
more
is
at
stake
for
the
defendant,
where
the
practice
not
only
precludes,
as
the
arkansas
practice
touch,
is
talking
to
the
jury,
but
is
presenting
any
evidence
or
his
counsel
even
meaningfully
arguing
that
issue,
in
light
of
a
full
record,
that
the
constitution
does
require
more
allocution
than
the
arkansas
procedure
allows
to
a
fellow
who
claims
his
privilege.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
it
does
not,
if
the
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
there
is
no
right
of
allocution
in
a
capital
case.
the
issue
is
submitted
to
jury
on
both
guilt
and
punishment
after
trial
of
guilt
face.
the
defendant
has
no
opportunity
to
make
a
statement,
either
of
technical
allocution
in
order
to
present
any
evidence
that
goes
to
sentencing
as
such
after
verdict.
now,
he
might
present
evidence
relevant
to
sentencing
before
a
verdict,
with
all
that
implies
for
giving
up
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
and
prejudicing
himself
on
the
guilt
issue.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
it
would
help,
but
i
don't
think
it
would
satisfy
the
constitutional
requirement,
because
there
would
still
be.
i
don't
know
what
that
such
a
rule
would
do
for
impeachment
for
example,
because
i
assume
that
his
credibility
would
be
an
issue,
with
regard
to
even
those
factors
that
he
spoke,
simply
going
to
mitigation.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
think
that
it
should
be
an
issue,
most
assuredly
and
therefore,
if
he
were
permitted
to
make
such
a
statement,
after
the
jury
had
determined
guilt.
i
would
have
no
problem,
but
the
difficulty
is
in
arkansas,
impeachment
involves
the
admission
against
the
defendant
of
literally
every
bad
act
in
his
life.
and
i
think
that
again,
the
tension
that's
created,
that
would
persuade
the
defendant
not
to
take
the
stand,
to
give
up
his
right
to
speak
in
mitigation,
because
of
the
tremendously
prejudicial
impact
to
that
on
the
guilt
phase
would
be
constitutionally
intolerable.
however,
that
again
is
not
this
case,
although
i
would
have
my
constitutional
doubts
about
that,
the
court
doesn't
even
have
to
reach
that
question
again
as
in
the
question
of
standards.
what
we
have
here
is
an
arkansas
procedure,
which
permits
arbitrariness
and
irrationality
by
giving
no
standards
to
the
jury
in
sentencing.
and
then
virtually
requires
that
the
decision
be
arbitrary,
if
the
defendant
doesn't
take
the
stand,
because
there's
simply
no
basis
for
the
juries
determining
the
facts
relevant
to
the
critical
sentencing
decision.
now,
any
of
those
factors
are
changed,
we
have
a
different
constitutional
case.
what
we
have
in
arkansas
is
the
irrational
trial
process
at
its
worst.
if
i
may
reserve
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
no,
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
no,
and
that
is
what
creates
the
constitutional
dilemma,
if
the
state
could
do
that,
whether
or
not
the
defendant
testify,
then
you
would
not
have
the
tension
between
constitutional
rights.
but
the
defendant
subject
himself
to
that
only
if
he
makes
character
an
issue
or
if
he
testifies.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
would
like
to
speak
to
questions
of
arkansas
law
that
came
up
and
not
reopen
the
constitutional
questions.
first,
with
regard
to
mr.
justice
brennan's
question,
we
have
dealt
at
pages
66
through
69
of
our
brief
with
the
kind
of
evidence
that
comes
in
from
impeachment
and
that
sort
of
thing.
it
is
indeed
very
broad,
for
example
the
right
case
we
mentioned
here,
in
which
the
rape
defendant
was
asked
whether
several
persons
had
not
told
him
to
quit
hanging
around
their
places
of
business,
because
he
made
indecent
proposals
to
women?
that's
the
kind
of
thing.
and
there
is
one
limitation
though,
i
don't
want
to
say
there
are
no
limitations.
apparently,
if
in
a
negative
act,
the
bad
act,
an
evil
act
is
not
reduced
to
conviction
and
it's
too
remote,
it
may
not
be
shown,
but
what
that
means
we
don't
know.
a
20-year
old
liquor,
misdemeanor
liquor
violations
have
come
in
to
impeach.
so
really
even
that,
it's
just
no
limitations
and
the
answer
is,
that
in
effect,
it
is
the
whole
defendant's
life
on
rebuttal
for
impeachment
if
he
takes
the
stand.
now,
with
regard
to
--mr.
justice
harlan
asked
at
one
point,
whether
the
jury
had
to
be
unanimous
in
arkansas,
the
answer
that
mr.
langston
gave,
as
i
understand
it
was
that
they
did,
but
i
want
to
make
clear
that
it
has
to
be
unanimous
either
way,
not
the
kind
of
situation
you
have
in
california,
where
one
juror
can
prevent
a
death
penalty.
if
the
jury
hangs,
the
jury
is
discharged
and
they
try
the
case
again.
and
that
also,
i
want
to
make
clear,
it
tends
to
point
the
way
the
construction
of
this
statute
that
mr.
langston
has
twice
mentioned,
this
43-2310,
which
he
said
gives
trial
courts
the
power
to
set
aside
verdict
on
the
ground
that
they
don't
--
they
find
outrageous
which
some
such
thing
a
jury
death
verdict.
to
start
with,
i
don't
think
the
statute
allows
that,
it
predates
the
1915
statute,
which
crease
discretion
in
capital
cases,
and
would
seem
to
apply
in
non-capital
cases
only.
there
is
in
other
statute
that
the
court
might
want
to
look
at,
which
is
43-2306,
which
provides
that
when
a
jury
find
the
verdict
of
guilt
and
failed
to
agree
on
the
punishment
or
do
not
declare
such
punishment,
and
the
judge
renders
judgment.
now,
mr.
langston
admits
that
doesn't
apply
in
capital
cases,
plays
in
the
same
terms
as
the
power
to
reduce
the
verdict.
and
the
reason
it
does
is
for
the
same
reason
that
43-2310
does
it.
it
was
inactive
before
the
1915
statute.
it
was
no
designed
to
deal
with
capital
cases.
now,
i'm
not
asserting
here
as
a
matter
of
arkansas
law,
i
can
tell
you
that
that's
statute
doesn't
give
judges
the
power
to
set
aside
verdicts.
it
doesn't
look
that
way.
and
i
have
asked
questions
of
arkansas
lawyers,
as
well
as
to
whether
they
know
of
any
case
in
which
a
judge
has
done
so,
and
the
answer
has
been
no.
when
mr.
langston
was
asked
the
question
last
time
up
in
oral
argument,
he
may
say
he
didn't
think
they
ever
done
so.
now,
i'm
not
denying
that
they
may
have
done
so,
i
have
never
heard
of
it.
i
know
in
california
they
have
that
power
and
i
know
it
for
two
reasons.
one,
that
california
supreme
court
has
said
so
in
an
opinion,
and
two,
judge
phillips,
for
example
in
oakland
has
done
so.
and
i
can
name
the
judge,
and
i
can
name
the
time,
and
i
know
the
case.
in
arkansas
that
has
never
happen.
and
that
is
one
of
the
several
things
that
differentiates
arkansas
from
california.
most
of
the
things
we
have
heard
from
mr.
harris
seem
to
me
to
demonstrate
of
anything,
the
entire
lawlessness
of
the
procedure
in
arkansas.
california
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
yes,
sir.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
was
simply
going
to
reserve
for
a
california
case
mr.
justice
harlan,
whether
the
california
procedure
was
good
or
bad.
but
as
mr.
harris
has
told
us,
it
is
far
better
than
arkansas.
and
everything
he
says
about
what
california
has
done
suggest
the
deficiencies
in
the
arkansas
procedure.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
in
arkansas,
no.
the
arkansas
supreme
court,
that's
the
one
thing
about
arkansas
law
i
can
assert
clearly.
if
the
verdict,
if
the
conviction
is
not
supported
by
sufficient
evidence,
then
of
course,
the
court
will
set
aside
the
verdict.
and
if
that
means
for
example
that
if
the
evidence
only
makes
out
second
degree
that
a
death
penalty
based
on
first
degree
goes,
but
only
because
the
first
degree
conviction
is
upset.
as
long
as
the
evidence
is
sufficient
to
sustain
a
verdict
of
guilt
for
capital
offense,
the
arkansas
supreme
court
has
told
us
very
clearly
that
there
is
no
appellate
power
to
set
aside
a
jury
imposed
death
penalty.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
not
at
all,
california
is
the
most
populous
state
in
the
nation.
the
major
reason
for
the
most
people
there
is
there
are
most
crimes
there.
secondly,
governor
brown
didn't
execute
anybody
for
years.
the
reason
for
the
pile
up
on
death
row
has
virtually
nothing
to
do
with
the
stay
or
anything
else.
it
has
to
do
with
the
fact
that
there
was
a
governor
in
that
state
for
many
years
who
had
very
few
executions
go
on.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
think
they
require
more
analysis.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
except
the
race
figure.
mr.
justice
burger,
the
race
figure
is
reliable,
because
it
controls,
studies
has
been
done.
none
of
the
other
factors
are
reliable,
but
the
fact
that
black
people
are
consistently
sentenced
to
death
for
rape,
that's
reliable.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
yes,
the
20
years
study
done
in
the
state
of
arkansas
and
presented
in
the
record
in
this
case.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
federal
habeas
corpus
proceeding
on
behalf
of
william
maxwell.
it
condemned
challenging
the
sentence
of
death
imposed
upon
him
by
an
arkansas
jury.
unlike
the
boykin
case
which
the
court
has
just
heard.
no
question
is
presented
here
with
regard
to
the
ultimate
power
of
the
state
of
arkansas
to
use
death
as
a
penalty
for
crime.
even
for
the
crime
of
rape
of
which
william
maxwell
was
convicted.
the
questions
presented
relate
entirely
to
the
procedures
by
which
the
death
penalty
is
administered
in
the
state
of
arkansas
and
by
which
out
of
the
total
number
of
persons
convicted
of
the
crime
of
rape,
some
are
selected
to
live
and
others
are
selected
to
die.
we
have
two
federal
constitutional
claims
against
the
arkansas
procedure
which
for
short
reference
i
may
term
the
standards
claim
and
the
single
verdict
claim.
in
order
to
put
this
into
prospective
and
to
show
their
relationship
because
i
think
they
are
eminently
related.
i
would
like
to
take
a
hard
look
at
the
outset
if
i
may
at
the
procedure
by
which
arkansas
does
determine
case
by
case
and
individual
cases
whether
persons
convicted
of
rape
shall
live
or
shall
go
to
their
death
in
the
electric
chair.
now
under
arkansas
law,
there
is
one
statutory
provision
which
provides
that
the
punishment
for
the
crime
of
rape
is
death.
in
other
statute,
in
effect
since
1915
provides
that
in
any
case
in
which
the
punishment
is
death
by
law,
the
jury
may
return
instead
a
verdict
of
imprisonment
for
life
in
state
penitentiary.
the
effect
of
these
two
statutes
therefore
is
to
create
an
authorization.
the
availability
of
returning
the
death
penalty
in
a
broad
range
of
cases
but
to
require
the
death
penalty
and
not
thereby
both
supposing
that
selection
is
possible
among
the
total
number
of
persons
convicted
of
rape
and
requiring
that
selection
must
in
fact
be
made
among
the
total
number
of
persons
convicted
of
rape
of
some
smaller
number
who
shall
suffer
death,
the
extreme
penalty
for
that
crime.
now,
it’s
not
surprising
that
such
a
selective
process
is
set
in
motion
by
arkansas
law
because
the
crime
of
rape
is
in
arkansas
as
elsewhere.
a
crime
that
includes
a
wide
range
of
factual
situations,
it
is
simply
any
consummated
sexual
assault.
it
can
be
committed
against
a
mature
woman,
against
a
child,
with
a
weapon
endangering
life,
or
not
endangering
life.
the
victim
can
be
permanently,
physically
injured
or
not
permanently
physically
injured.
tremendous
range
of
factual
situations
involved
any
large
range
of
offenders
and
in
fact
on
this
record
one
can
say
that
only
about
a
quarter,
25
out
of
a
100
of
the
persons
actually
convicted
of
rape
get
to
death
sentence.
now,
i
put
the
focus
here
at
the
beginning
to
point
out
what
i
--
where
i
think
the
focus
has
to
be
in
this
case.
on
the
process
by
which
that
selective
judgment
is
made,
this
is
not
an
insignificant
or
non-important
process.
it
is
literally
vital
but
it
is
also
vital
and
legal
sense
because
the
law
of
arkansas
as
to
whether
rape
is
or
is
not
a
capital
offense
is
in
fact
being
made
case
by
case
as
in
each
individual
adjudication
the
determination
is
made
whether
the
defendant
lives
or
dies.
it
is
a
law
making
process
the
penalty
for
rape
in
arkansas
is
not
death.
it
is
subjection
to
this
decisional
process
and
the
question
which
this
case
presents
is
whether
the
specific
procedure
here
is
in
arkansas.
to
make
that
decision,
comport
with
the
constitution.
now,
how
is
the
decision
in
fact
made.
it
is
made
in
each
case
by
a
jury.
a
jury
cannot
be
waived
in
a
death
case
in
arkansas.
if
as
petitioner
maxwell
did,
the
defending
contest
guilt
if
the
intensity
is
innocent,
a
jury
is
in
impaneled
to
decide
two
distinct
questions
whether
he
is
guilty
of
the
crime
of
rape
and
if
so,
what
punishment
shall
be
imposed
upon
it.
as
to
the
first
of
these
two
decisions
whether
or
not
the
defendant
is
guilty
of
rape,
the
jury
is
guided
as
it
is
in
any
criminal
case
by
the
law
defining
the
crime
of
rape
and
the
trial
in
the
capital
case
in
arkansas
is
not
unusual
in
this
regard.
the
jury
can’t
convict
the
defendant
simply
because
they
don’t
like
him
or
because
he’s
unpleasant
or
because
they
don’t
like
the
color
or
his
skin
or
for
any
other
reason.
it
can
convict
him
only
if
they
find
each
element
of
the
offense
established
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
on
the
record.
the
definition
of
the
crime
of
rape
gives
the
jury
something
to
talk
about.
when
they
go
back
to
decide
the
case,
they
talk
with
each
other
about
what
is
the
elements
of
the
offense
they’re
made
out
and
the
rule
of
law
that
is
being
applied
by
the
jury
to
decide
the
guilt
question
and
only
the
guilt
question
is
the
same
rule
of
law.
it
applies
to
every
other
person
in
arkansas
as
previously
been
tried
for
rape
or
will
be.
when
we
get
to
the
penalty
question,
on
the
other
hand,
we
are
in
a
different
world
because
on
the
penalty
question
the
jury
is
given
no
instructions.
the
jury
is
given
no
principles
to
guide
its
decisions.
the
ordinary
procedure
in
arkansas
is
simply
to
give
the
jury
two
forms,
a
death
form
which
rates
we
find
the
defending
guilty
as
charge
and
a
life
form
which
says
we
find
the
defendant
guilty
as
charge
and
sentence
him
to
imprisonment
for
life.
no
instructions
are
given.
the
jury
is
simply
told,
take
your
choice.
now,
we
have
characterized
that
process
of
decision
making
in
our
brief
not
in
the
constitutional
sense
or
simply
a
descriptive
sense
as
arbitrary.
and
i
might
rest
on
that
because
neither
california
nor
arkansas
in
response
as
coupled
with
that
question
only
they
defend
the
process
of
sentencing
as
i
understand
it
on
the
ground
that
it
constitutes
a
beneficent
arbitrariness.
but
i
think
it
is
helpful
to
examine
in
somewhat
more
detail
exactly
what
is
entailed
in
what
i
call
an
arbitrary
process.
the
jury
is
given
in
making
its
determination
of
life
or
death
a
choice
which
it
may
make
without
any
prerequisite
findings
of
fact.
that
is
to
say
the
ordinary
procedures
that
we
all
know
as
lawyers,
it
ordinarily
go
on
in
courts
of
law.
where
a
judge
says
to
a
jury
if
you
find
“x”
then
the
result
would
be
“y.”
simply
it
doesn’t
apply.
there
are
no
required
findings
of
fact.
the
jury
need
not
find
that
the
defendant
use
the
weapon
or
permanently
injured
the
victim
or
that
he
had
a
prior
record
or
any
such
thing.
any
and
every
offense
of
rape
may
be
punished
by
death
nor
required
findings
of
fact.
not
only
are
there
no
specific
required
findings
of
fact
in
the
nature
of
aggravating
circumstances
in
that
sort
of
thing.
there
are
no
general
findings
of
fact
put
to
the
jury.
the
question
is
not
asked
would
society
be
safe
if
this
man
were
incarcerated
in
the
penitentiary
for
life.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
resume
a
brief
description
of
the
exact
nature
of
the
discretion
that
the
arkansas
jury
has
in
capital
sentencing.
as
i
have
said,
there
are
no
prerequisite
factual
findings
to
return
a
death
verdict.
the
jury
may
need
to
find
nothing
specific
in
aggravation.
of
the
sort
that
for
example
the
european
codes
used
that
the
offense
was
committed
with
the
weapon
or
that
the
defendant
had
a
prior
conviction
of
a
similar
offense
or
any
such
thing.
there
are
--
is
no
general
required
finding
of
fact
such
as
that
the
defendant
is
unreformable
or
recidivist
or
incurable
or
any
such
thing.
there
are
no
preclusive
findings
of
fact
that
is
findings
which
will
exclude
the
death
penalty.
the
jury
is
not
told
if
you
find
that
the
defendant
was
suffering
a
mental
disease
or
defect
which
rendered
him
unstable
or
that
the
defendant
has
no
prior
record
or
that
the
victim
did
not
use
a
great
degree
of
force
and
resistance
or
that
the
defendant
did
not
use
the
weapon
you
may
not
sentence
to
death.
and
there
are
similarly
no
general
preclusive
findings
of
the
nature
of
emotional
disorder
or
any
such
thing.
there
is
no
direction
to
the
jury
that
it
shall
take
consideration
of
any
particular
range
or
realm
of
fact.
the
jury
is
not
told
in
deciding
whether
the
sentence
to
defend
into
life
or
death
you
shall
take
into
account
whether
the
defendant
used
the
weapon
or
whether
the
victim
was
previously
chased
or
the
character
of
the
defendant
or
any
of
those
things.
there’s
not
even
an
authorization
which
would
direct
their
attention
to
some
things
you
may
take
account
of
such
and
such
and
the
jury
is
not
told
that
there
are
things
they
may
not
take
account
of.
you
may
not
take
account
of
race.
you
may
not
take
account
of
anything
that
the
legislature
thinks
irrelevant
to
its
purposes
in
enacting
the
death
penalty.
there
are
no
principles
for
judgments.
no
standards
for
judgments
given
to
the
jury
at
all.
not
even
a
kind
of
vague
standard
that
is
the
minimum
we
use
in
any
kind
of
other
judicial
proceedings
such
as
reasonable
man.
it’s
sometimes
easy
to
forget
how
much
the
reasonable
man
standard
does
direct
the
jury
in
a
civil
damage
case.
at
least
the
jury
knows
that
the
defendant’s
obligation
is
to
exercise
reasonable
care,
the
care
that
the
reasonable
man
would
exercise
toward
the
plaintiff.
our
whole
law
assumes
that
that
has
significance.
it’s
different
from
the
duty
the
defendant
owes
to
a
trespasser
to
exercise
somewhat
less
care
that
he
might
owe
to
someone
who
he
has
special
duty
to
care
for.
the
jury
in
the
civil
case
isn’t
told
that
they
may
return
a
verdict
against
the
defendant
if
they
don’t
like
him
or
if
there’s
something
offensive
about
him
or
any
such
thing.
the
issue
is
framed.
he
owes
a
duty
of
care.
how
much
care?
the
care
that
a
reasonable
man
would
exercise.
there’s
no
such
thing
in
the
capital
sentencing
discretion.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
is
your
asking
of
capital
sentencing
or
regular
sentencing?
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
in
capital
sentencing,
ordinarily
there
are
no
greater
standards
given.
in
non-capital
sentencing,
there
may
or
not
be
but
even
if
there
are
no
standards
given,
explicitly
by
statute,
the
kind
of
discretion
he
exercises
is
very
different
than
that
which
a
jury
exercises
in
sentencing
to
death
for
a
number
of
reasons.
one
is
that
the
judges
are
professional
sentencer
and
although
we
certainly
make
no
attack
on
the
jury
system
as
such
we
think
that
we
need
not
get
any
or
near
attacking
the
jury
as
an
administrator
of
rules.
it
is
very
clear
that
a
professional
sentencer
is
better
at
formulating
rules
adjudication
by
adjudication
than
in
ad
hoc
where
people
in
my
point
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
there
are
number
or
relevant
points
in
nine
capital
sentencing,
apart
from
the
professional
quality
of
the
judge,
professionalism
your
honor
is
a
number
of
things
all
wrapped
into
one.
when
the
fact
that
the
judge
sentences
a
number
of
cases
involved
some
consistency,
he
is
the
man
that
does
at
each
time
if
only
the
consistency
of
his
habit,
there’s
a
consistency
there.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
think
that’s
right
except
in
so
far
as
certain
standards
are
built-in
to
the
assumptions
of
the
system
which
are
not
built-in
to
capital
sentencing
such
as
rehabilitation.
when
a
judge
sentences,
he
knows
that
the
man
whom
he
is
going
to
sentence
is
going
to
come
out
after
a
period
of
time.
and
he
has
to
make
a
judgment
as
to
whether
the
period
is
so
severe
that
the
man
is
going
to
be
a
serious
danger
from
rehabilitative
standpoint.
afterwards,
it’s
not
true
of
the
capital
sentencing
decision.
it’s
also
true
that
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
you
know
our
statutes
that
do,
do
that
in
some
states
but
the
model
sentencing
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
no,
it
is
not.
it
is
not
indeed.
on
the
other
hand,
the
judge
inevitably
is
going
to
do
so
and
the
development
in
evolution
of
sentencing
counsels,
appellate
review
in
some
greater
or
lesser
form
affects
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
a
practice
that
is
possible
because
the
state
provides
an
institutional
nexus
for
it.
both
the
professional
sentence
or
in
the
assumptions
of
the
system,
neither
which
are
true
in
capital
sentencing,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
a
mandatory
death
sentence
it
would
have
none
of
the
problems
that
this
case
raises
your
honor.
i
would
have
troubles
depending
on
the
nature
of
the
statute
under
other
constitutional
provision
but
none
that
are
involved
in
this
case.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
your
honor,
that
is
the
standard
though.
if
everyone
who
is
convicted
of
a
given
crime
is
sentence
to
death,
you
don’t
have
what
we
are
complaining
about
in
this
case
in
individualizing
process
which
selects
without
where
more
reason,
one
person
to
die
and
the
other
person
to
live.
a
jury
sitting
in
one
case
determining
not
perhaps
because
it
takes
a
different
view
of
the
facts
of
this
case
than
the
facts
of
another
case
but
because
it
may
take
a
totally
different
view
of
the
legal
determiners
that
may
find
that
it
need
not
to
have
legal
determiners.
it
may
sentence
one
man
to
live
and
another
to
die.
now
that
is
the
essence
of
the
standards
of
this
complaint
that
we
make.
and
it
does
not
involve
where
you
have
mandatory
capital
sentencing
because
every
one
in
the
class
is
treated
identical.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
our
contention
is
limited
to
capital
cases
and
the
justification
for
us
so
limiting
it
is
--
it
lies
in
three
things
i
think.
first,
this
court
has
made
clear
for
considerable
period
of
time
that
the
degree
of
arbitrariness,
it
is
permissible
in
a
sentencing
system
is
less
where
the
penalty
is
grave
where
i
speak
of
skinner
and
oklahoma.
now
skinner
held
that
you
couldn’t
sterilize
thieves
if
you
didn’t
sterilize
embezzlements.
i
think
that
nobody
on
the
unanimous
court
have
decided
that
case
assume
that
indeed
the
opinions
of
the
contrary
that
you
couldn’t
sentence
embezzlers
to
15
years
and
certain
thieves
to
10.
at
that
level
of
discrimination
or
determination,
there’s
no
question
about
distinguishing
between
embezzlers
and
thieves.
when
you
sterilize
them
or
when
you
kill
them,
that’s
something
else
again.
the
second
consideration
i
think
is
that
and
this
goes
to
mr.
justice
white’s
point
as
well.
that
when
you
are
dealing
with
a
non-capital
sentencing
regime,
there
are
number
of
considerations
that
come
into
play
that
justify
more
arbitrary
individualize
judgments
than
when
you’re
dealing
with
a
capital
sentencing
regime.
non-capital
sentencing
inevitably
involves
in
some
point
the
question
of
reformation
and
the
only
tools
with
which
we
as
a
society
at
the
moment
come
to
grips
with
the
question
of
reformation
are
the
highly
individualize
diagnostic
judgment
that
are
made
of
particular
individuals.
now
i
myself
have
very
serious
troubles
with
the
infusion
of
therapy
in
the
sentencing
because
sentencing
becomes
a
mixed
bag
of
individual
i
supposedly
helpful
therapeutic
considerations
and
penal
judgments
but
the
question
is
to
what
kind
of
standards
to
imply
on
that
process
is
much
a
little
more
like
the
question
involved
in
the
mcgautha
case
as
to
how
much
you
can
justify
some
arbitrariness
in
the
imposition
of
penal
sanctions
in
order
to
serve
therapeutic
ends
which
require
extreme
flexibility.
in
capital
sentencing,
there
is
no
therapeutic
need
and
no
therapeutic
justification.
the
death
penalty
is
the
one
penalty
of
which
one
can
say
cannot
be
justified
for
purposes
of
reformation
or
rehabilitation.
it
is
a
writing
off
of
this
human
preacher
as
fit
for
rehabilitation
and
no
individualize
judgments
of
the
sort
that
need
to
be
made
diagnostically
enter
into
the
judgment.
so
that
there’s
no
excuse
for
the
degree
of
individualization
without
rules
of
law
in
capital
sentencing
that
there
is
non-capital
sentencing.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
your
honor,
i’m
simply
saying
that
this
case
doesn’t
present
that
question.
my
personal
view
is
that
there
is
a
grave
constitutional
deficiency
in
such
a
system.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
think
that
a
great
deal
depends
on
several
things.
what
decision
is
being
made?
the
importance
of
the
decision,
a
life
and
death
quality
decision
is
in
my
judgment
unique.
who
is
making
the
decision?
i
think
there’s
a
difference
between
the
judge
and
the
jury.
i
think
that
the
(inaudible)
case
which
requires
certain
standards
for
jury
action
may
not
mean
that
a
judge
has
sub-standards
in
taxing
costs.
i
think
that
the
parameters,
the
outer
boundaries
of
judgment
are
very
important.
if
i
may
let
me
try
to
frame
this
issue
in
terms
of
one
that
is
more
familiar
to
this
court’s
jurisprudence
historically.
the
question
that
is
raise
as
i
see
by
our
standards
attack
is
in
not
a
typical
question
of
how
you
limit
discretion
and
keep
it
within
constitutional
confines.
if
you
take
for
example
a
legislature
that
wants
to
regulate
parades
in
the
state
it
could
simply
pass
a
permit
statute
that
says
no
one
may
conduct
a
procession
without
the
permit
from
the
chief
of
police.
now
that
would
raise
the
greatest
constitutional
difficulties
under
the
decisions
of
this
court.
now
if
it
wanted
to
enact
to
one
that
delimited
the
discretion
how
might
it
go
about
it.
there
are
whole
host
of
ways
in
which
it
might
go
about
it.
one
it
might
say
whoever
conducts
a
procession
with
vehicles
or
a
procession
on
the
streets
or
a
procession
on
pennsylvania
avenue
between
14th
street
and
the
capital
that
delimits
the
range
of
cases
within
which
the
judgment
is
being
made.
secondly,
it
might
say
that
in
determining
whether
a
permit
shall
issue
the
chief
of
police
shall
take
account
of
traffic
congestion,
the
movement
of
emergency
vehicles,
simply
whether
there
is
another
parade
or
procession
the
same
day
and
that
sort
of
thing.
third,
it
might
subject
the
judgment
of
the
permit
issuer
to
review
by
another
agency
by
a
court.
now
each
one
of
this
without
getting
rid
of
discretion
totally
delimits
the
discretion
and
again
it
would
make
a
considerable
difference
whether
the
permit
is
totally
unavailable
or
whether
the
permit
issuer
only
had
the
power
to
put
it
off
for
a
day
set
it
some
time
within
the
week
but
not
in
a
particular
day
requested
and
that
sort
of
thing.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
precisely
and
what
--
where
i
think
we
are
in
this
case
is
where
this
court
was
in
1930
when
they
first
began
to
enact
permit
ordinances.
it
simply
has
to
say
whether
an
arkansas
procedure
which
has
available
to
it,
all
of
the
different
devices
by
which
they
might
control
the
discretion
limiting
the
range
of
cases
to
which
it
applies
providing
for
aggravating
circumstances
and
prerequisite
findings
of
fact
precluding
the
death
penalty
when
certain
mitigating
findings
are
made.
establishing
rules
or
principles
or
even
just
telling
the
jury
so
that
they
have
something
to
talk
about
when
they
go
back
there
and
they
all
have
to
agree
that
you
must
come
to
a
decision
consonant
with
some
certain
principle.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
am
not
saying
that
the
constitution
does
not
require
standards
to
be
judge.
i’m
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
saying
only
that
this
case
does
not
raise
it.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
that
is
correct.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
thank
you
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
--
the
third
is
more
limited
to
arkansas
and
to
this
case
and
it
is
that
the
arkansas
supreme
court
does
review
sentences
imposed
by
juries
in
non-capital
cases
and
it
does
not
in
capital
cases.
and
as
i
was
trying
to
sketch
out,
it
makes
for
me
a
great
deal
of
difference
whether
the
discretion
is
limited
by
a
review
or
whether
it
is
not.
that’s
one
of
the
factors
that
makes
the
discretion
given
juries
in
death
cases
totally
arbitrary
with
no
restraint,
no
protection
against
us.
now,
i’m
not
passing
at
this
point
beyond
the
standards
argument.
i
launch
to
offend
this
and
the
court
simply
of
describing
the
standard
was
trial.
i’d
like
to
finish
if
i
may
my
description
of
the
trial
process
and
then
state
briefly
the
two
constitutional
contentions
that
emerge
from
it.
the
arkansas
jury
not
only
makes
the
guilt
and
penalty
determinations
but
make
some
at
one
sitting
if
the
defendant
contests
guilt.
all
the
evidence
be
it
on
all
questions
is
submitted
at
once.
the
jury
goes
out
and
returns
a
verdict
both
on
guilt
and
on
punishment.
now,
the
effect
of
this,
the
most
immediate
effect
of
this
is
fairly
obvious.
if
the
defendant
takes
the
stand
to
speak
to
have
his
voice
heard
by
the
people
of
the
power
of
life
and
death
decision
over
him,
he
runs
into
all
of
the
prejudices
that
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
is
intended
to
protect
him
against.
first,
if
he
takes
the
stand
and
doesn’t
claim
innocence
he
is
going
to
be
convicted.
there
is
just
no
doubt
that
the
jury
will
convict
him
when
he
gets
on
the
stand,
testifies
and
doesn’t
say,
i
didn’t
do
it.
if
he
gets
on
the
stand
and
he
does
testify
that
he
didn’t
do
it.
be
subject
to
cross-examination
which
is
clearly
potentially
incriminating.
in
addition
to
that
under
arkansas
procedure,
he
is
subjected
to
impeachment
of
the
most
vicious
sort.
literally,
every
bad
act
however
remote
and
whether
reduced
to
conviction
or
not
can
come
in
against
them
with
inevitable
prejudice
on
the
guilt
determination.
on
the
other
hand,
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
there
is
only
one
limitation
that
i
know
of
your
honor.
there
are
couple
of
arkansas
cases
that
say
that
a
bad
act
which
is
too
remote
may
not
be
proved
but
the
arkansas
court
has
admitted
for
example
a
minor
liquor
violation,
20
years
old
and
an
automobile
accident,
24
years
old
those
sorts
of
things.
so,
i
think
the
remoteness
requirement
is
insignificant
and
the
practical
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
however
prejudicial,
for
example
we
have
cited
in
our
brief.
cases
in
which
the
man
on
in
trial
for
murder
who
took
the
stand
was
impeached
by
showing
that
he
had
committed
a
prior
murder.
it’s
relevance
to
credibility
is
questionable
but
it’s
prejudiced
on
the
guilt
issue
as
obvious.
now
this
is
the
kind
of
thing
for
which
he
let’s
himself
in
if
he
takes
the
stand.
on
the
other
hand,
if
he
doesn’t
take
the
stand,
he
literally
goes
to
slaughter
like
a
dumb
beast.
he
is
deprived
of
his
best
witness
on
facts
and
mitigation.
he
is
the
only
person
who
can
tell
about
his
motivation
particular
circumstances
that
may
have
let
out
to
the
act
for
which
he
subsequently
convicted
which
may
convince
the
jury
in
its
totally
unfettered
discretion
not
to
sentence
him
to
death.
he
is
the
best
witness
on
background
facts.
facts
about
his
childhood,
his
upbringing
that
jury
may
take
into
account.
more
than
that,
his
testimony
is
the
only
thing
that
can
bring
home
to
the
jury
that
they
are
sentencing
a
human
being,
a
live
human
being
who
may
have
heard
speak
like
other
human
beings
and
lies
the
characteristic
of
speech
that
human
beings
have.
they
are
sentencing
such
a
person
to
death.
and
what
happens
in
a
case
like
william
maxwell
is
that
if
a
defendant
decides
that
he
is
going
to
exercise
his
privilege
against
self-incrimination
and
not
take
the
stand
and
not
be
subject
to
impeachment.
and
not
proved
guilt
out
of
his
own
mouth.
he
goes
to
life
or
death
decision
without
the
jury’s
ever
having
heard
a
word
uttered
by
him.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
would
say
the
facts
are
described
in
the
arkansas
supreme
court’s
opinion
in
370
s.w.2nd
and
i
think
this
court
could
notice
the
facts
described
in
it.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
the
trial
transcript
your
honor
is
not
in
this
record
and
there
is
a
recitation
of
the
facts
as
fairly
complete
by
the
arkansas
supreme
court
on
appeal.
as
to
arkansas
is
taking
any
position
to
the
jury
thus
indeed
rely
on
those
facts,
the
answer
is
we
simply
don’t
know.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
it’s
not
required.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
suppose
that
might
be.
the
proof
doesn’t
seem
to
meet
the
theory
because
the
evidence
that
we
have
gathered
indicates
that
there
are
three
factors
which
distinguish
people
who
are
sentenced
to
death
from
people
who
are
sentence
to
life
generally
in
arkansas
race.
the
commission
of
the
contemporaneous
offense,
some
other
offense
like
robbery
which
maxwell
did
not
commit
and
a
prior
record
imprisonment
and
we
do
not
know
whether
maxwell
has
any
such
prior
record
in
imprisonment
on
this
record.
it
may
well
be
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
we
would
not
know
from
the
trial
record
maxwell.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
by
exercising
the
privilege
avoided
going
into
the
question
of
background
at
all
with
the
result
and
this
is
not
a
typical
that
a
defendant
who
claims
the
privilege
has
the
jury
decide
whether
or
not
he
should
leave
based
on
five
minutes
of
his
life
or
10
minutes
of
his
life.
all
they
know
about
this
man
is
what
they
have
heard
that
he
did
in
the
few
minutes
constituting
the
crime.
no
more
than
that
is
known.
now,
whether
or
not
the
theory
of
arkansas
is
that
they
act
on
that.
our
theory
is
that
they
need
not
act
on
that
under
arkansas
law.
arkansas
law
allows
the
jury
to
act
on
something
broader
than
that
if
it
is
present,
but
the
defending
can
present
it
only
at
the
cause
of
waiving
his
federal
constitutional
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
mr.
justice
stewart,
the
status
of
the
trial
transcript
in
this
case
is
very
confused.
let
me
state
it
briefly
as
best
as
i
can.
the
pretrial
order
of
the
federal
district
judge
in
this
case
provided
that
the
transcript
would
be
available
and
that
portions
of
it
might
be
put
in
to
the
record
by
counsel
if
they
wish.
no
portions
were
formally
put
into
the
record.
on
the
other
hand,
the
trial
transcript
had
been
around
in
the
district
court
for
a
long
while.
this
being
maxwell
second
habeas
corpus
petition
and
the
district
judge
in
fact
relied
on
it
in
some
part
although
none
of
it
was
formally
introduced
for
some
of
his
findings
such
as
a
finding
that
maxwell
did
not
take
the
stand.
the
transcript
because
it
was
not
in
the
record
in
the
district
court
did
not
go
up
to
the
eighth
circuit.
shortly
before
the
decision
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit,
the
clerk
of
that
court
wrote
counsel
asking
the
copy
of
the
trial
transcript
be
furnished
and
the
court
of
appeals
also
relied
on
certain
aspects
of
it
such
as
portions
of
the
opening
argument
by
defense
counsel
in
that
sort
of
thing.
again,
formally
it’s
not
here.
i
do
not
think
that
the
transcript
is
in
fact
before
this
court.
it
is
not
physically
here
but
i
do
not
think
that
it
is
in
fact
here.
however,
certainly,
those
facts
which
appear
in
the
opinions
below
or
in
the
opinion
of
the
arkansas
supreme
court
might
properly
be
relied
on
by
this
court.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
oh
yes
and
i
don’t
think
there’s
–
indeed,
we've
going
to
the
point
of
actually
in
our
appendix
say
according
portion
of
it
none
otherwise
because
they
think
it’s
non-controversial
and
it
is
a
public
record
of
course.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
don’t
know
when
it’s
technically
lodged
there.
it
certainly
was
sent
there
and
they
do
have
a
copy.
now
if
i
may
briefly
pass
from
what
i
had
intended
to
be
merely
descriptive
to
the
argument.
the
standards
question
seems
to
be
resolved
by
the
briefing
in
this
case
into
a
relatively
simple
matter.
we
contend
that
the
power
given
arkansas
jury’s
to
sentence
to
life
or
death
is
legally
arbitrary
in
violation
in
the
rule
of
due
process.
it
offense
we
think
every
aspect
of
the
rule
of
law
that
this
court
has
found
previously
in
the
due
process
clause.
first
of
all,
it
involves
sentencing
on
a
case
by
case
basis
by
jurors
who
need
not
even
discuss
why
they
choose
to
send
the
man
to
death.
if
they
do
discuss
why
and
they
decide
on
a
common
ground,
there
is
no
assurance
that
that
ground
is
common
to
any
other
defendant
but
this
defendant.
the
man
who
was
just
tried
and
just
convicted
and
just
sentenced
to
life
might
have
facts
like
identical
with
those
of
the
defendant
who
now
goes
to
death.
the
only
difference
being
that
because
arkansas
provides
no
help,
the
jury
state
different
views
neither
of
the
facts
but
of
the
law.
a
necessary
consequence
of
that
kind
of
arbitrariness
and
decision
making
is
that
people
are
unequally
treated
in
violation
of
the
notion
basic
we
submit
to
both
due
process
in
equal
protection
that
requires
evenhanded
administration
of
justice.
people
treated
similarly.
it
doesn’t
mean
no
individualization
in
sentencing.
but
it
means
individualization
on
a
rational
basis
not
on
a
hit
or
miss
flip
basis
that
arises
from
having
no
standards
whatever
from
making
the
sentencing
decision.
it
also
means
that
not
only
are
the
people
who
are
sentence
to
death
treated
unevenly,
unequally
as
against
those
sentenced
to
life.
but
they
are
treated
irrationally,
in
the
sense
that
there
is
no
relationship,
no
assured
connection
between
the
purposes
for
having
a
death
penalty
at
all
and
its
imposition
in
this
case.
there
is
nothing
to
assure
that
whatever
arkansas
may
want
to
achieve
by
allowing
rapes
to
be
punished
by
death.
that
on
the
fact
of
this
particular
case
with
justification
attaches.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
it
is
not
your
honor.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
well,
it
depends.
now,
again
the
federal
statute
is
somewhat
different.
some
of
them
give
the
judge
sentencing
power
or
just
give
the
jury
sentencing
power.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
as
to
the
federal
statutes
that
give
the
jury
sentencing
power,
they
do
it
in
the
same
that
arkansas
does.
and
that
indeed
is
true.
i’m
quick
to
admit
of
most
jurisdictions.
now
there
are
differences
in
terms
of
there
were
degree
of
reviewability
of
the
jury’s
judgment,
some
jurisdictions
provide
that
they
jury
must
make
the
determination
on
the
evidence
of
record
but
arkansas
does
not.
there
are
also
is
about
the
minor
differences
but
the
major
thrust
of
the
arkansas
procedure
is
not
use
in
the
federal
courts
in
jury
sentencing
and
elsewhere.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
pardon
me,
mr.
justice
brennan?
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
well,
in
illinois
for
example,
the
concurrence
of
the
trial
judge
and
the
jury
is
necessary.
in
arkansas,
the
jury
alone
makes
a
decision
and
as
i’ve
indicated
i
think
there
are
may
be
difference
in
response
to
mr.
justice
fortas’
question.
there
may
be
a
difference
if
you
have
a
judge
sentencing.
there
may
not
but
there
may
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
the
only
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
no,
i
think,
i
think
not
except
to
the
extent.
it
does
come
to
the
interrelatedness
of
our
two
arguments
where
you
have
a
split
verdict
procedure.
we
have
a
two-trial
procedure.
the
effect
may
be
different
because
the
jury
has
a
plenary
penalty
trial
as
more
to
basic
judgment
on.
but
in
specific
response
to
your
honor’s
question,
the
answer
is
that
they
are
equally
without
standards.
frankly,
what
has
happened
simply
is
this.
the
legislature
had
passed
the
buck
all
over.
we
have
mandatory
capital
sentencing
for
an
off
a
long
time.
and
when
that
became
politically
impossible
to
maintain,
instead
of
proceeding
to
determine
in
what
case
is
the
death
penalty
would
be
implied
the
legislatures
all
over
simply
said
we
can’t
decide
this
so
i’m
going
to
pass
it
under
the
jury
and
they
simply
made
it
discretionary.
they
did
--
they
are
differing
forms
of
substance
of
crime,
differing
procedures
the
notions
of
discretion
is
essentially
common.
now
the
--
a
third,
i
think
vitally
important
thing
you
recognize
in
the
regime
which
is
common
and
in
practice
in
arkansas
is
simply
that
the
jury
can
get
away
with
the
most
flagrant
violations
of
clear
constitutional
rights
without
getting
caught
at.
one
of
the
purposes
of
the
rule
of
law
of
the
requirement
that
procedures
be
regular
systematically
apply
and
applicable
to
all
like
cases
is
simply
to
prevent
against
abuse.
now
what
we
have
in
arkansas
and
this
is
what
i
think
is
the
relevance
of
the
racial
evidence
on
this
record
is
a
sentencing
pattern
of
clear
racial
discrimination.
it
couldn’t
be
caught
said
the
district
court
because
the
factors
that
go
into
the
jury’s
decision
case
by
case
are
so
intangible,
so
difficult
to
catch
on
to
that
you
can’t
prove
that
even
a
jury
which
even
a
set
of
juries
of
which
convict
negroes
of
raping
white
victims
and
sentence
them
to
death
disproportionately
frequently
or
in
fact
discriminate.
we
don’t
know.
they
may
be
all
sorts
of
intangible
factors
other
than
race
that
affects
it.
the
eighth
circuit
took
the
view
that
somewhat
more
hardheaded
that
probably
juries
are
in
fact
discriminated
generally.
but
maxwell’s
theory
probably
didn’t
discriminate.
again,
how
do
you
know?
there’s
no
way.
the
jury
didn’t
have
to
have
any
reason
little
on
any
specific
reason
for
fixing
the
death
penalty
and
so
what
happens
under
a
regime
of
this
sort
is
not
only
that
the
giving
up
of
all
political
responsibility
in
the
representatives
of
the
people,
legislature
to
fix
standards
of
general
application
passing
the
buck
in
effect
to
individual
juries.
but
when
individual
juries
react
in
a
way
which
violates
the
most
clear
and
unequivocal
commands
of
the
constitution,
a
court
can’t
catch
them
out.
now,
our
submission
essentially
is
that
such
a
regime
violates
a
rule
of
law
basic
to
do
process.
that
there
is
in
here
in
the
very
notion
of
due
process
of
law,
the
requirement
of
a
rule
of
law
which
governs
light
cases
and
applies.
i
think
that
this
court
would
not
for
example
sustain
an
arkansas
sentencing
procedure
which
provided
that
every
man
convicted
of
rape
should
roll
a
dice
and
if
it
came
up
7
or
11,
he
would
die.
and
any
other
numbers,
he
would
live.
actually,
what
arkansas
has
done
is
worst.
it’s
worst
because
i
assume
that
the
dice
would
not
discriminate
on
grounds
of
race
and
its
worst
because
the
2
out
of
12
chances
that
each
man
would
have
are
at
least
identical.
we
have
not
even
that
assurance.
and
the
argument
is
made
by
arkansas
and
it’s
made
by
california
and
everybody
is
being
treated
evenhandedly
and
equally
under
the
sentencing
procedure.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
would
be
glad
to
address
that.
there
are
several
ways
i
think
a
legislature
could
go
about
it.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
as
far
as
the
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
as
far
as
the
federal
constitution
was
concerned,
it
would
satisfy
our
demands
for
a
constitutional
rule
of
law
provided
that
the
following
conditions
were
met.
one,
that
the
standards
were
announced
by
the
highest
court
of
the
state
or
at
least
approved
by
it
so
that
the
same
standards
were
now
as
by
different
trial
judges
in
different
cases.
two,
that
the
standards
were
made
clear
before
the
trial
so
that
the
defendant
would
have
a
fair
opportunity
to
know
what
he
was
trying
at
the
trial
provided
that
those
two
conditions
were
met.
and
that
the
standards
themselves
met
the
substantive
requirements
of
definiteness
for
standards.
it
wouldn’t
matter
whether
they
were
done
legislatively
or
judicially
and
i
would
think
it’s
a
matter
of
state
policy.
it
would
be
quite
improper
for
a
court
to
promulgate
this
justice
i
as
i
was
going
to
suggest,
i’m
troubled
about
suggesting
specific
standards
to
this
court
because
the
individual
standards
that
one
designs
are
responsive
to
the
most
fundamental
penological
policy
questions
as
to
why
you
use
the
death
penalty
and
when
and
that’s
a
matter
of
legislative.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
let
me
respond
to
that
in
two
ways.
first,
by
saying
that
i
have
in
mind
something
not
terribly
unlike
the
approach
taken
by
the
model
penal
code
although
that’s
not
an
exclusive
approach
and
then
although
again
i
voice
caution
for
two
reasons.
first
of
all
the
model
penal
codes
description
of
the
aggravating
and
mitigating
circumstances
and
that
sort
of
thing
applies
to
murder
and
not
rape
and
so
it’s
of
no
use
particularly
in
drafting
a
rape
statute
and
also
because
i
have
very
grave
trouble
about
certain
of
the
specific
formulations
of
the
model
penal
code.
for
example,
one
of
the
aggravating
circumstances
that
is
it
a
crime
is
attrocious.
that
troubles
me.
i
think
that
they
could
describe
and
get
out
what
they
want
in
terms
of
it
being
committed
on
a
minor
child
or
helpless
person
or
being
committed
with
considerable
willful
infliction
of
pain
so
that
there
are
number
of
details
about
the
model
penal
code.
i
might
quarrel
that
the
approach
is
a
not
insignificant
model.
now,
second
way
to
respond
to
that
is
to
try
to
give
you
what
i
think
of
it
some
ways
in
which
a
legislature
concerned
with
the
crime
of
rape
might
put
standards
into
a
sentencing
statute.
one
way,
they
might
go
about
it
is
in
the
manner
i
suggested
in
describing
what
arkansas
didn’t
have.
you
can
have
required
factual
findings,
prerequisite
factual
findings.
you
can
consider
them
if
you
will
aggravate
in
circumstances.
the
jury
may
not
impose
the
death
penalty
unless
it
finds
that
the
defendant
used
a
weapon
that
he
injured
the
victim
permanently
in
a
physical
way
that
he
committed
the
offense
on
a
victim
of
gravely
disparate
age.
one
can
enumerate
half
dozen
by
of
course,
it
simply
indicate
that’s
one
approach.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
then
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
well,
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
no,
i
don’t
think
that’s
necessarily
so.
i
have
trouble
in
conceiving
the
matter
that
way
for
two
reasons.
one,
the
arkansas
legislature
hasn’t
release
any
other
kind
of
rape.
it
said
that
that
penalty
is
available
for
any
other
kind
of
rape
but
we
don’t
really
expect
that
it
will
be
impose
of
any
other
kind
of
rape.
it’s
going
to
be
imposed
either
wholly
or
arbitrarily
or
in
some
set
of
sub-classes
and
it’s
made
no
attempt
whatever
to
define
those
sub-classes
but
in
addition
to
that
this
is
only
one
of
the
ways
in
which
a
legislature
might
regularize
the
procedure.
if
a
legislature
said
that
the
governing
issue
was
the
atrocity
of
the
crime.
at
least
that
would
allow
the
jury
to
consider
that
in
focus
as
distinguished
from
the
character
of
the
defendant.
if
the
legislature
said
yes,
any
old
kind
of
rape
but
the
issue
is
how
bad
is
the
defendant?
is
he
reformable?
will
the
public
safety
be
served
adequately
by
imprisoning
him
for
life
instead
of
killing
of
him?
that
would
be
a
test
the
jury
could
apply
which
would
focus
in
far
more
than
we
have
the
issue
before
the
jury.
if
i
may,
i’d
like
to
simply
state
that
the
essence
of
our
constitutional
contention
with
regard
to
the
single
trial
procedure
is
related
but
distinct
from
the
attack
on
the
standard
was
penalty
trial
related
because
as
the
factual
description
i’ve
given
you
in
the
case.
any
defendant,
who
claims
his
privilege
against
self-incrimination
necessarily
goes
to
trial
for
his
life
in
front
of
a
jury
which
is
totally
uninformed,
totally
deprived
of
the
requisites
of
information
for
rationally
sensing
it
and
therefore
the
arbitrariness
which
the
standard
list
discretion
allows.
almost
inevitably
in
fact
is
what
occurs
in
sentencing
the
jury
has
no
basis
on
which
to
sentence
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
this
case
and
our
submission
do
not
raise
that
question.
i
think
that
other
provisions
of
the
constitution
and
those
we
invoke
here
do
require
that.
but
that’s
no
point
of
our
submission
here.
what
we
do
say
is
this,
that
where
a
state
authorizes
each
jury
to
take
any
view
of
the
law
and
any
view
of
the
facts
and
sentence
the
defendant
to
life
or
death
on
any
basis
that
if
it
then
requires
the
defendant
to
forego
the
exercise
of
his
privilege
against
self-incrimination
as
the
cost
of
putting
before
the
jury
material
on
which
rational
sentencing
decision
can
be
based
that
he
has
so
burdened
the
exercise
of
the
privilege
and
so
deprived
of
rationality
the
determination
which
is
ultimately
made
by
the
jury
of
the
defendant
exercises
his
privilege
that
the
due
process,
of
course
along
with
the
fifth
amendment
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
do
not
know
whether
there
is
a
provision
for
pre-sentence
reports
in
non-capital
cases.
i
would
assume
that
there
was
none.
i
would
assume
so
because
non-capital
sentencing
is
also
done
by
jury
in
arkansas
in
the
ordinary
procedure
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
would
assume.
if
i
may,
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
counsel
are
permitted
to
argue
to
the
jury,
yes.
and
both
counsels
may
argue
to
the
jury
with
regard
to
the
death
sentences.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
of
course,
the
difference
is
that
prosecution
is
also
of
good
things
to
argue
from,
his
got
the
crime
and
defense
counsel
if
the
defendant
exercised
the
privileges
nothing
argued.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
mr.
justice
stewart,
my
statement
that
counsel
are
permitted
to
argue
to
the
jury
arises
from
my
observation
of
reading
a
transcripts
in
arkansas
death
cases.
there
is
no
decision
of
the
arkansas
supreme
court
which
specifically
talks
about
counsel
arguing
to
the
jury
at
all.
let
alone
defines
what
arguments
are
proper
and
what
arguments
are
not.
one
can
find
nothing
in
arkansas
case
law
that
is
instructive
about
standards
that
stems
from
the
argument.
i
simply
state
from
observation
that
counsel
are
indeed
permitted
by
the
trial
court
to
argue
the
penalty
issue
of
the
jury
although
as
your
honor
suggests
in
other
states
not
even
that
is
permitted,
the
discretion
is
suppose
to
be
so
arcained
a
matter
that
it
emerges
services
and
works
its
doings
only
in
the
jury
room.
that’s
not
so
in
arkansas.
if
i
may
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
so
far
as
i
know,
there
is
no
--
there
has
been
no
reported
decision
challenging
a
prosecutor’s
argument
or
sustaining
a
defense
counsel’s
argument
or
whatever
but
the
discretion
is
absolute
and
one
would
assume
that
if
the
discretion
is
absolute
that
absolutely
anything
may
be
argued.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
no,
but
it
would
be
better
than
arkansas
because
at
least
the
focus
is
on
the
crime.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
oh,
i
must
therefore
your
honor.
i
think
that’s
not
so
every
rape
crime
is
a
serious
crime
there’s
no
doubt
about
it.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
well,
cutting
her
up,
she
suffered
some
cuts
and
bruises.
you
--
no.
your
honor,
must
remember,
what
we
are
talking
about
is
a
state
in
which
we
have
intra-racial
crimes,
14%
of
the
cases
get
out.
now,
one
asks
you
know
just
guessing
whether
this
isn’t
the
most
serious
14%
of
the
cases.
i
would
say,
having
seen
a
lot
this
cases
that
in
my
judgment
at
least
that
it
is
not
but
that
is
a
judgment
in
any
event
that
i
leave
to
your
honor.
however,
the
important
thing
is
the
jury
doesn’t
think
about
that.
jury
doesn’t
have
to
care
whether
this
is
atrocious
not
atrocious,
heinous,
where
the
victim
was
injured
where,
the
cuts
were
accidental,
how
long
they
lasted,
whether
they
were
cured,
any
of
those
things.
none
of
that’s
relevant.
the
jury
does
goes
out
and
decides.
but
maybe
they
don’t
like
to
follow
the
defendant.
may
sense
some,
yes.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
my
position
would
be
that
something
which
simply
gave
a
judge
the
power
to
do
the
same
arbitrate
test
the
jury
is
now
doing
would
not
be
constitutional.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i’m
sorry.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
if
they
did
that?
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
yes.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
well,
although
it’s
worst
to
give
a
jury
this
kind
of
discretion,
it
seems
to
me
that
what
one
does
when
it
passes
it
to
the
judge
with
no
more
than
that
is
essentially
to
again
permit
a
judge
to
make
individual
judgments
case
by
case
which
need
to
have
no
relationship
to
the
judgment
pass
in
the
next
case.
now
there’s
not
quite
as
that
in
the
jury
because
a
judge
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i’m
not
sure
i
understand
the
question,
your
honor.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
non-capital,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
that
is
correct.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
a
hundred
years
in
some
offenses.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
oh,
yes,
your
honor
certainly.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
except
those
which
are
assumed
within
the
preconditions
of
the
judicial
role
or
which
emerged
form
the
fact
that
it’s
mr.
justice
white
has
put
it,
you
have
a
professional
sentencer
subject
to
common
aspirations,
common
experience
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
in
my
judgment,
i
would
not
although
again
i
must
refer
the
court
to
a
distinction
that
i
think
is
crucial
between
capital
and
non-capital
sentencing.
i
think
there
are
justifications
for
a
more
clinical
case
by
case
approach
in
non-capital
sentencing
that
are
not
available
in
capital
sentencing
and
i
am
clear
from
the
decisions
of
this
court
that
the
degree
of
arbitrariness
allowable
is
greater
with
the
imposition
is
greater
and
the
death
penalty
is
the
greatest
known
demand.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
for
this
case,
i
have
no
intentions
to
go
and
step
behind.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
have
very
great
difficulty
with
the
whole
regime
of
sentencing
in
the
discretion
that
we
had.
and
so
to
a
lot
of
other
people
but
i
need
to
know
further
in
this
case
and
death
cases.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
it
was
not
a
constitutional
assumption.
it
was
assumption
as
to
what
illinois
law
required.
if
a
state,
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
the
court
said
permits
this
kind
of
discretion
then
it
cannot
stuck
the
jury
in
exercising
the
discretion.
but
i
think
the
court
needed
to
make
none
and
made
none
of
the
kind
of
assumption
that
is
of
the
constitutional
nature
that
only
could
do
this.
the
question
was
not
raise
in
witherspoon
whether
illinois
did
do
it.
it
appear
that
illinois
had
done
it
and
the
question
was
whether
you
can
give
the
jury
unfettered
discretion
and
then
skew
people
who
exercise.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
no,
although
it
would
present
a
limitation
in
each
question
of
diminished
responsibility
or
narrower
definition
of
the
crime
or
whatever.
now
is
the
outer
parameters
if
the
discretion
and
therefore
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
if
it
were
put
in
as
a
limitation
on
the
death
penalty,
as
distinguished
from
a
limitation
on
conviction.
it
might
do
that
but
then
again
you
fall
into
the
problem
of
the
single
verdict
trial.
we
don’t
know
whether
maxwell
has
to
diminish
responsibility
or
anything
else
because
it
couldn’t
present
evidence
on
that
without
waiving
the
privilege.
again,
the
interrelatedness
of
the
two
issues
becomes
apparent.
the
diminished
responsibility
alone
would
solve
neither
of
our
two
constitutional
contentions
separately
or
together.
thank
you.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i’d
prefer
to
reserve
it
if
i’m
right
for
rebuttal.
i’ve
gone
a
way
and
i
would
not
take
the
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
we
have
no
objection
in
having
the
court
have
the
transcript
before
it.
i
would
like
to
speak
in
rebuttal
as
to
the
propriety
of
ruling
on
the
witness
per
issue.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
we
certainly
have
no
objection
on
the
transcript.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
i
would
like
to
address
three
things
if
i
may
in
rebuttal.
one,
the
substantive
arguments
for
the
states
of
california
and
arkansas,
only
very
briefly.
two,
the
witherspoon
question
in
this
case.
and
three,
the
point
brought
up
by
california
as
the
differences
between
california
and
arkansas
procedure
and
the
relevance
of
that
for
disposition
of
this
matter.
my
response
on
this
substantive
level
can
be,
i
think
very
brief.
as
i
understand
that
both
california
and
arkansas
admit
that
we
got
an
arbitrary
procedure
going
here
and
they
defended
simply
on
the
ground
that
it’s
necessary,
they
can’t
do
anything
else
whether
it’s
beneficial
to
the
defendant.
both
in
reading
the
brief
and
in
hearing
the
oral
argument,
i
was
struck
that
i
heard
this
argument
somewhere
before.
and
so
i
look
around
i
found
it
indeed,
i
have.
this
--
the
argument
that
you
have
to
allow
arbitrary
discretion
so
is
to
individualize
on
the
facts
of
each
individual
cases,
originally
written
by
william
taylor
in
1785.
he
was
defending
the
english
bloody
code
under
which
250
crimes
were
capital.
and
he
defended
that
on
the
ground
that
you
couldn’t
get
a
narrower
formulation.
just
no
way
i
which
you
could
cut
down
on
some
of
these
crimes
by
fixing
standards,
taking
somewhat
might
have
been
careful.
he
said,
the
preference
for
the
english
system
of
having
a
broad
net
in
which
he
can
make
capital
punishment
available
and
then
letting
the
executive
commute
was
in
the
consideration
that
the
selection
of
proper
objects
for
capital
punishment
depends
principally
upon
circumstances
which
however
easy
to
perceive
in
each
particular
case
after
the
crime
is
committed.
it
is
impossible
to
enumerate
or
define
before
him
and
so
on.
and
he
concluded
eventually
that
the
law
of
england
was
based
on
the
wise
policy
of
sweeping
into
the
net
every
crime
which
under
any
possible
circumstances
may
marred
the
punishment
of
death
and
then
letting
individual
circumstances
furthered
out
and
concluded
that
the
wisdom
and
humanity
of
this
design
furnish
a
just
excuse
for
the
multiplicity
of
capital
offenses
which
the
laws
of
england
are
accused
to
creating
beyond
those
of
other
countries
as
the
bloody
code
was
justified.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
about
250,
your
honor.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
that’s
correct.
the
only
other
thing
i
need
to
answer
to
this
suggestion
that
the
arbitrary
discretion
is
justified
by
necessity
or
beneficence
is
that
it
makes
an
awful
difference
who
you
are
being
beneficent
to.
it
might
well
be
that
you
defendants
might
get
a
better
shake.
a
lot
of
them
would
get
more
even
handy
justice
and
makes
difference
whether
it
was
white
or
black
defendants
that
you’re
talking
about
in
terms
of
whether
this
are
good
or
bad
system.
but
in
any
event
i
want
to
emphasize
that
our
argument
does
not
take
discretion,
compassion,
or
anything
else
out
of
the
system.
that
is
what
mr.
justice
fortas
was
talking
about
when
he
spoke
about
the
next
question
or
the
next
case.
the
question
is
whether
standards
can
be
devised
which
lead
compassion
in
but
narrow
the
range
of
discretion
beyond
what
arkansas
allowed
and
our
only
contention
here
is
that
arkansas
has
found
the
net
too
broadly
and
delimited
to
discretion
too
little.
we
do
not
contend
for
mandatory
categories
which
we
throw
out
wisdom
and
pity
and
compassion.
we
simply
contend
for
rule
of
law
that
limits
the
application
of
the
death
penalty
much
more
narrow
that
arkansas
does.
now
the
second
thing
i
want
to
address
myself
to
is
witherspoon.
i
hope
that
in
looking
at
the
transcript
of
--
what
we
argue
in
this
case
this
court
will
remember
a
number
of
things.
first,
witherspoon
has
been
generally
cut
to
ribbons
by
the
courts
below.
and
i
don’t
think
the
court
can
likely
assume
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
not
arkansas
your
honor,
by
every
lower
court
that
i’ve
seen
decided
witherspoon
case
since
witherspoon
earlier.
there
are
dozens
of
them
pending
on
certiorari
here.
the
kind
of
cutting
the
ribbons
i’m
talking
about
is
that
the
lower
courts
(a)
have
eased
up
on
the
kind
of
opposition
to
the
death
penalty
that
permits
exclusion.
secondly,
they
have
authorized
exclusion
where
question
is
asked
which
the
pretty
good
witherspoon
question
but
the
answer
is
equivocal.
they
authorize
exclusion.
three,
they
read
pre-witherspoon
records
and
saw
they
were
done
in
light
up
witherspoon
assume
that
the
jury
is
saying
something
that
meets
the
witherspoon
testing.
go
ahead
and
let
him
sit
for
a
number
of
courts
have
held
that
if
only
a
couple
of
jurors
are
thrown
off
under
witherspoon,
it
doesn’t
make
it
bad
as
only
a
couple
were
here.
five,
the
courts
have
held
that
if
the
prosecutor’s
remaining
pre-emptor
challenges
exceed
the
number
of
juries
in
question
that
that
sentence
doesn’t
get
vacated
under
witherspoon.
i
raised
all
these
for
this
reason.
this
case
has
never
had
a
witherspoon
claim
at.
the
habeas
petition
was
filed
prior
to
witherspoon.
the
district
court
specifically
since
this
is
a
second
federal
habeas
corpus
petition
as
whether
there
were
other
issues
in
the
case.
witherspoon
was
never
put
in
here.
the
court
said,
you
know
i’m
going
to
be
very
weary
about
--
weary
and
wary
about
entertaining
a
third.
i
just
wouldn’t
simply
assume
that
this
case
going
to
be
settled
or
that
maxwell
is
going
to
stay
alive
for
vindication
of
some
witherspoon
claim
and
again
i’m
worried
about
the
witherspoon
claims
on
this
record
in
term
unless
this
court
sets
right.
all
of
the
developments
of
post-witherspoon
law
which
it
made
a
very
limited
ruling
indeed
out
of
witherspoon,
more
than
that,
maxwell
has
been
on
death
row
in
arkansas
since
1962.
he
has
twice
come
within
a
few
days
of
his
death,
the
last
time
to
be
saved
only
by
a
stay
issued
by
mr.
justice
white
of
this
court.
what
a
lot
of
courts
are
doing
in
light
of
witherspoon
is
the
same,
we
vacate
the
death
since
we
give
them
a
new
trial,
new
penalty
trial
now
to
determine
whether
he
should
live
or
die.
it
would
be
inhumanity
second
only
to
killing
this
man.
not
to
resolve
the
issue
now
finally
presented
whether
the
state
of
arkansas
has
any
right
to
be
trying
this
man
for
his
life
under
the
unconstitutional
procedures
that
we
are
challenging.
i
can
appreciate
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
don’t.
i
think
i
have
two
reactions
to
it.
one,
i
doubt
it.
depends
on
what
standards
they
are.
and
it
assumes,
it
assumes
that
our
argument
is
an
argument
for
mandatory
categories
which
would
take
compassion
out
of
the
system.
we
don’t
argue
for
that.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
have
your
honor
and
i
will
add
this.
there
are
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge,
475
men
on
death
row
at
this
moment
in
the
country,
470
of
them
were
sentence
by
juries
exercising
discretion
akin
to
or
in
some
way
like
arkansas.
the
decision
in
this
case
which
we
asked
for
would
vacate
or
lay
the
ground
for
vacating.
a
number
of
death
sentence
as
we
contend
are
unconstitutional.
the
governor
of
arkansas
has
14
men
on
death
row
whose
executions
he
has
held
out
pending
disposition
of
this
case.
this
court
has
before
it
petitions
for
certiorari
from
alabama,
from
new
jersey,
from
north
carolina,
from
california
raising
this
issue.
i
am
very
sensitive
to
the
notion
that
this
court
should
not
decide
constitutional
questions
prematurely.
but
if
eminent
death
of
dozens
of
people
can
make
an
issue
not
premature,
the
issues
presented
here
are
not
premature.
there
is
no
question
of
no
adversity,
there’s
enough
adversity
in
this
case
to
float
a
dozen
constitutional
issues.
there
is
not
enough.
there’s
no
question
here
of
an
unfocused
nature
of
the
issues.
the
issues
are
clearly
focused
and
the
question
is
presented
for
decision
we
suggest
that
for
this
court
to
put
up
on
speculation
of
witherspoon
or
something
else.
the
contention
between
this
parties
arkansas
contending
he
has
a
right
to
try
william
m.
maxwell
and
kill
him
without
standards
and
are
contending
that
for
eight,
the
better
part
is
six
years.
he’s
been
on
death
row
and
for
longer
than
that
under
jeopardy
of
death
under
an
unconstitutional
regime.
that’s
the
issue
we
put
this
court.
we
ask
this
court
to
decide
the
arkansas
procedure
is
unconstitutional
for
violation
of
the
rule
of
law
and
we
hope
that
it
will
reach
and
decide
the
issue
in
this
case.
thank
you.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
court
is
thoroughly
familiar
with
this
case,
which
has
been
the
subject
of
one
prior
oral
argument
here
and
a
briefing
--
voluminous
briefing
by
the
parties
and
various
amici
curiae.
as
i
see
the
matter,
there
are
at
this
time
four
questions
before
the
court.
the
first
two
are
the
questions
on
which
this
court
granted
certiorari
in
december
of
1968.
number
one,
whether
the
arkansas
practice
of
giving
its
juries
unlimited,
unguided,
and
unreviewable
power
to
sentence
persons
convicted
of
rape
to
live
or
die,
violates
the
rule
of
law
fundamental
to
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
two,
whether
the
arkansas
practice
of
trying
simultaneously,
in
a
capital
case
the
issues
of
guilt
and
of
punishment
also
violates
fourteenth
amendment.
those
are
the
questions
which
in
the
jargon
of
this
case
are
non-respectively
as
a
standards
issue
and
the
single
verdict
issue.
the
third
question
is
one
which
arises
from
this
court's
decision
in
boulden
versus
holman.
in
that
case
as
in
this
one,
a
state
prisoner
condemned
to
death,
brought
a
federal
habeas
corpus
proceeding.
in
the
course
of
which,
he
presented
no
client
prior
to
the
appearance
of
the
case
in
this
court,
challenging
the
selection
of
the
jury
that
condemned
him
to
die.
notwithstanding
that
issue
had
not
been
presented
in
the
lower
courts
and
is
not
included
in
the
application
for
certiorari
here,
this
court
held
that
it
could
notice
that
the
record
in
his
case
disclosed
a
violation
of
the
rule
of
witherspoon
versus
illinois,
in
the
process
by
which
jurors
had
been
death
qualified
in
the
selection
of
this
jury.
and
the
court
therefore,
vacated
and
remanded
the
case
to
the
district
court
for
further
consideration
of
that
witherspoon
client.
that
i
will
refer
to
in
this
case
as
to
witherspoon
issue.
the
fourth
question
presented
to
the
court
is
not
a
substantive
one.
it
is
simply
which
in
how
many
of
the
first
three
questions
this
court
will
address.
i
would
like,
if
i
may
to
begin
with
that
with
a
question,
unless
i
waste
the
court's
time.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
mr.
justice
harlan?
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
the
fourth
question
is
not
a
substantive
question,
mr.
justice
harlan.
it
is
which
of
the
first
three
the
court
ought
to
reach.
and
rather
than
launch
in
to
discussion
of
the
first
three,
i'd
like
to
talk
a
little
about
that
fourth.
now,
i
recognize
in
talking
about
the
fourth
that
this
is
uniquely
a
matter
for
the
judgment
and
for
the
discretion
of
this
court.
but
i
do
want
to
state
some
facts
that
i
think
it
is
important
that
the
court
know
in
exercising
that
discretion.
to
my
knowledge
there
are
somewhat
more
than
67
death
cases
pending
on
petitions
for
writs
of
certiorari
in
this
court.
in
the
past
weeks,
i
have
caused
examination
to
be
made
of
all
of
the
ones
that
we
could
identify,
and
we
have
examined
67.
there
are
45
cases,
out
of
that
67
coming
from
18
states,
which
present
either
the
standards
issue
or
the
split
verdict
issue.
to
be
specific,
the
standards
issue
is
presented
in
43
cases.
the
split
verdict
issue
is
presented
in
18.
again,
to
the
best
of
my
current
information,
there
are
presently
on
the
death
rows
in
this
country,
approximately
510
condemned
men.
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
maxwell
case
on
the
standards
issue,
would
potentially
affect
all
but
five
of
those
510
condemned
men,
that
is
better
than
500.
the
decision
of
this
court
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
no,
mr.
justice
stewart,
although
there
are
in
the
statute
books
of
several
states
mandatory
capital
crimes.
there's
only
one
active
mandatory
capital
crime
in
the
sense
that
people
are
being
tried
for,
there's
no
anybody
on
death
row
for
it.
the
five
people
to
whom
i
refer
are
five
california
convicts
who
are
presently
on
death
row,
because
of
conviction
of
a
crime,
which
carries
a
mandatory
death
penalty
(voice
overlap).
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
death
penalty
with
standards
are
mandatory
death
penalty.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
the
split
verdict
issue
would
potentially
effect
to
the
best
of
my
calculation
and
this
is
a
very
rough
one,
380
to
390
of
the
510
men
are
on
death
row.
and
this
mr.
justice
stewart
is
of
course
because
several
of
the
states,
including
those
with
the
major
death
row
populations,
such
as
california
have
split
verdict,
so
that
the
number
is
very
significantly
reduced.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge,
mr.
justice
brennan
five:
connecticut,
new
york,
california,
pennsylvania,
and
texas
has
it,
and
here's
what
causes
the
difficulty
in
my
figuring
out
how
many
men
are
involved.
texas
has
it,
but
only
put
it
in
recently,
so
that
some
people
on
death
row
in
texas
were
convicted
under
a
single
verdict
procedure.
texas
now
has
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
pardon
me?
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
new
york
put
it,
i
believe
as
a
result
of
the
interim
report
of
the
committee
whose
final
report
led
to
abolition
and
that
would
have
been
back
around
1965.
however,
there
are
very
few
people
on
death
row
in
new
york,
as
a
result
of
the
almost
total
abolition
now
of
the
death
penalty
in
that
state.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
it
was
--
i
think
that
the
split
verdict
for
capital
trials
wasn't
involved
in
spencer
there.
texas,
since
spencer
has
revised
both
the
procedure
for
recidivist
trials
and
the
procedure
for
sentencing
in
capital
cases.
the
one
other
area
that
i
think
i
want
to
bring
to
the
court's
attention,
in
connection
with
the
question
of
what
issues
it's
had
reached
comes
from
experience
of
about
five
years
in
dealing
with
these
cases.
prior
to
the
time
when
this
court
granted
review
in
maxwell
versus
bishop,
the
job
of
getting
stays
of
execution
for
condemned
men
was
an
incredibly
difficult,
perilous
job.
on
occasions,
courts
would
stay
executions.
occasionally,
we
would
have
to
come
to
the
justices
of
this
court
to
get
stays
of
execution
a
day,
two
days
before
the
execution
dates
were
set,
as
we
did
in
this
maxwell
case.
since
the
grant
of
review
in
maxwell
versus
bishop,
it
has
been
far
easier
to
get
courts
to
be
willing
to
stay
an
execution,
until
this
court
finally
disposed
of
the
issues
in
this
case.
and
the
question
of
getting
stays
of
execution
is
a
vital
one,
literally
of
course.
but
also
a
troublesome
one,
because
many
of
the
men
on
death
row
are
still
not
represented,
and
those
of
us
who
are
trying
to
represent
them
very
often
don't
learn,
until
the
last
minute
that
an
execution
date
has
been
set.
since
maxwell
v.
bishop
was
brought
before
this
court,
the
governors
of
several
states,
arkansas,
massachusetts,
washington,
have
agreed
to
hold
up
all
executions
in
the
state,
pending
decisions
of
these
issues
by
this
court.
however,
if
this
court
should
dispose
of
the
maxwell
versus
bishop
case
on
a
ground,
which
does
not
resolve
the
standards
and
the
single
verdict
issues,
and
if
it
does
not
simultaneously
grant
review
on
those
issues
in
one
of
the
other
pending
cases.
the
problem
of
getting
stays
of
execution
will
not
be
even
what
it
was
before
the
grant
of
review
in
maxwell
versus
bishop,
it
will
be
far
worst.
the
reason
for
that
is
this,
that
in
recent
years,
and
for
the
most
part,
since
the
grant
of
review
in
maxwell
versus
bishop,
the
highest
courts
of
17
states,
including
the
states
with
the
eight
largest
death
row
populations
in
this
country
have
rejected
the
standards
client.
there
are
on
the
death
rows
of
those
states
about
380
condemned
men.
and
the
claim
has
also
have
been
rejected
by
the
federal
courts
of
appeals
of
the
eighth,
ninth,
and
tenth
circuits
with
a
result
that
federal
stays
of
execution
in
habeas
corpus
would
also
not
likely
be
available.
the
standards
issue,
pardon
me,
split
verdict
issue
has
at
the
same
time
been
rejected
by
the
highest
courts
of
11
states,
having
about
220
men
on
their
death
rows.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
pardon
me?
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
all
but
13,
mr.
justice
harlan
and
of
course,
that
simply
a
pragmatic
answer,
that
is
i'm
not
treating
states,
which
have
it
for
treason,
but
don't
use
it
to
answer.
what
this
means
in
effect
is
that
if
ever
there
were
an
issue
of
grave
national
importance,
it
is
the
issue
presented
in
the
questions,
on
which
this
court
granted
review
in
this
case,
in
december
of
1968.
it
may
well
be
that
the
constitutional
contentions
raised
by
maxwell
and
by
these
other
condemned
men
are
not
going
to
be
sustained,
but
i
would
only
ask
that
this
court
pass
upon
those
issues
in
this
case
or
in
another
before
the
executions,
which
will
surely
follow.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
if
the
split
verdict
issue
and
not
the
standards
issue
were
decided
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
would
estimate
that
there
would
be
130
men
on
death
row
in
principally
three
states.
the
other
two
states
that
have
split
verdict
don't
have
very
many
men
on
death
row.
but
there
would
be
approximately
130
men
on
death
row
in
three
states,
who
would
still
go
to
their
death
with
the
issue
of
standards
unresolved.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
california,
which
has
85
--
90
men
on
death
row,
pennsylvania
which
has
20
men
on
death
row.
and
whatever
number
in
texas
were
tried
under
the
new
split
verdict
procedure.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
mr.
chief
justice,
i
am
asserting
only
that
the
constitution
compels
the
procedure
of
providing
standards
of
some
sort
to
guide
a
jury
in
its
discretion.
and
that
it
requires
some
form
of
trial,
not
necessarily
the
single
verdict
trial
in
fact
been
used
in
california
or
pennsylvania,
that's
a
matter
of
the
state
to
decide
what
procedure
it
wants
to
use.
but
that
the
constitution
requires
some
form
of
trial,
which
does
not
whipsaw
a
capital
defendant
between
his
privileges
against
self-incrimination,
and
his
right
to
provide
the
jury
with
adequate
information
to
make
an
informed
sentencing
choice.
i
want
to
make
that
very
plain
because
i
think
in
the
last
oral
argument,
i
failed
to
do
so,
and
i'm
not
at
all
clear
we've
done
so
in
the
briefs.
i
do
not
regard
this
case,
as
a
case
which
poses
any
newfangled
notions
of
due
process
or
any
notions
of
an
expanding,
collapsing
concept
to
due
process
into
which
i
am
asking
the
judges
of
this
court
to
pour
their
own
penological
judgments,
that
is
not
this
case,
and
that
is
not
this
kind
of
due
process.
the
kind
of
due
process
that's
involved
in
this
case
is
the
most
fundamental,
basic,
traditional,
classical
concept
of
due
process,
simply,
due
process
as
the
law
of
the
land,
in
the
meaning
of
magna
carta,
a
requirement
of
legality,
a
requirement
of
lawfulness.
and
mr.
chief
justice,
it
is
our
assertion
not
that
the
procedures
that
we
are
urging
are
better
procedures
or
more
humane
procedures,
or
even
more
beneficial
procedures
to
the
defendant.
several
points
have
been
made
on
several
occasions,
that
some
of
the
procedures
we're
arguing
for
might
be
worst
for
defendants.
defendants
who
have
worst
backgrounds
and
worst
histories,
would
be
worst
sought,
if
there
were
standards
which
what
the
juries
takes
those
things
into
a
cam.
i'm
not
standing
here
to
ask
for
something
here
better
for
defendants
or
worst
for
defendants,
or
more
humane,
or
a
better
of
way
of
doing
it.
what
the
constitution
requires
is
law.
it
requires
a
regularized
system
for
the
adjudication
of
issues
by
courts,
and
that
is
what
a
procedure
we
are
challenging
in
this
case
last.
now,
if
i
may
focus
in
on
that
procedure
and
talk
then
first
about
the
standards
question.
i
think
there
is
something
of
a
misconception
in
the
approach
to
the
jury
sentencing
in
capital
cases,
which
suggest
that
what
the
jury
is
doing
in
a
death
case
is
to
exercise
some
sort
of
clemency
or
mercy,
or
as
mr.
harris
called
it
in
the
last
argument
here,
compassion.
i
think
that
in
an
examination,
both
of
the
practice
in
arkansas
and
elsewhere.
and
if
the
statute
in
arkansas
and
elsewhere
makes
very
clear
that
the
claimed
of
determination
that
is
being
when
juries
choose
between
the
penalties
of
life
and
death.
it's
a
very
different
business
than
the
release
of
some
few
people
from
what
is
otherwise
a
mandatory
or
even
a
normal
punishment
for
the
offense
for
which
they
have
been
convicted.
what
the
statute
in
arkansas
does
is
not
to
make
death
“the
penalty”
for
a
rape.
it
is
not
to
make
death
the
penalty
for
any
in
all
varieties
of
rape
or
even
for
some
special
varieties
of
rape.
it
is
to
make
it
unavailable
penalty
with
an
equally
available
penalty
of
life
imprisonment.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
in
1915
mr.
justice
harlan,
that's
1915,
1-9-1-5.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
before
that
it
was
mandatory.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
yes
mr.
justice
stewart,
if
there
were
any
states
that
didn't
follow
that
course,
i
don't
know
of
them.
the
ordinary
practice
in
every
state
that
i
know
of
was
exactly
that,
that
after
the
mandatory
death
penalty
became
for
some
reason
intolerable
and
impossible
to
maintain,
legislatures
instead
of
attempting
to
define
subclasses
of
cases,
in
which
it
might
be
permissible
to
sentence
a
man
to
death,
simply
said
let
the
jury
have
it,
the
jury
can
decide.
and
it
is
--
i'm
talking
nothing
under
the
rug,
its
a
general
practice.
it
is
the
universal
practice
for
the
states
to
simply
turn
it
over
to
the
jury.
and
for
the
most
part,
this
is
a
twentieth
century
phenomena,
this
doesn't
go
back
much
further
than
that.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
that's
right.
the
difference
is
the
matters
of
detail.
the
matters
of
detail,
i
may
be
critical
for
constitutional
purpose,
such
as
the
detail
as
to
whether
or
not
the
judge
may
review
the
jury's
determination.
but
for
a
general
overall
description
of
the
kind
of
institution,
we're
talking
about.
we
are
talking
about
one
that
in
virtually
all
states
is
the
same
and
involves
exactly
the
process
that
your
honors
described.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
no,
your
honor,
there
is
jury
sentencing
in
non-capital
cases,
in
a
number
of
states.
i'm
not
a
student
of
this,
but
my
impression
is
that
they
are
largely
southern
states.
arkansas
is
one
such
state.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
oh!
my
belief
is
that
it
is,
but
i
would
not
be
sure
of
that.
there
is
a
parallel
development
mr.
justice
white.
it
is
true
in
penology
generally
that
the
law
has
moved
from
--
mandated
legislatively
fix
sentences
for
specified
crimes
to
a
range
of
sentences
available
for
the
crime.
now,
i'm
quite
sure
that
it
was
in
the
process
of
that,
the
juries
were
given
discretion
in
the
states,
in
which
they
now
have
it.
but
whether
it
came
earlier
later
than
the
development
in
capital
cases,
i'm
not
sure,
because
there's
so
many
other
devices
in
non-capital
cases
that
came
in
too.
giving
the
judge
a
range
of
sentences,
the
maximum,
minimum,
the
indeterminate
sentence,
all
of
those
things.
i'm
not
sure
historically
when
that
came
in.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
that's
right.
the
district
of
columbia
was
one
of
the
last
three
jurisdictions
in
this
country
to
have
a
mandatory
death
penalty.
again,
i'm
talking
about
a
mandatory
death
penalty
for
murder.
there's
still
some
mandatory
death
penalties
on
the
books
but
they
simply
are
not
used,
and
the
reason
they're
on
the
books
is
that
it's
not
being
used.
there'd
been
no
pressure
to
take
them
off.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
let
me
put
it
this
way
mr.
chief
justice,
i
have
no
hesitation
in
contending
that
anytime
that
a
legislature
gives
a
jury
completely
arbitrary
power
to
single
out
from
among
the
total
number
of
people
convicted
of
any
crime.
some
who
will
live,
and
some
who
will
die
without
standards
for
that
determination,
without
guidelines,
and
it
does
violate
the
constitution.
but,
i
could
see
a
distinction
being
drawn
between
crimes.
i
do
--
i
would
not
drag,
but
i
would
urge
that
in
this
case,
the
case
of
rape,
you
have
a
somewhat
easier
case
than
you
do
a
first-degree
murder.
and
the
reason
for
that
is
that
the
amount
of
discretion
that
may
be
tolerable.
i
keep
saying
discretion;
it
isn't
discretion
in
any
legal
sense.
the
amount
of
raw
naked
power
to
take
a
life
or
save
a
life
that
can
be
given
may
depend
on
the
range
of
cases,
within
which
the
jury
can
exercise
it.
now,
what
is
rape?
is
a
very
broad
range
of
offenses,
it
ranges
from
anything
from
a
fellow
and
a
girl,
who
had
been
going
together,
getting
into
a
situation,
and
he
going
too
far
over
resistance
to
a
brutal
beating
of
a
child
with
permanent
physical
injury
or
torture
rape
or
something
like
that.
it's
just
a
tremendous
range
of
factual
situations
encompassed
within
the
notion
of
rape.
so
that
the
idea
that
the
offensive
rape
sets
any
limitation
or
gives
guidance
to
the
jury,
is
just
totally
(inaudible).
there
are
within
the
total
gambit
of
cases
in
which
convictions
of
rape
come
down,
an
infinite
variety
of
factual
circumstances.
now,
the
theory
seems
to
be
that
the
jury
somehow,
that
12
men
brought
off
the
street,
who
have
never
sentenced
anybody
else,
and
will
never
sentence
anybody
else
again,
who
have
no
way
of
making
the
judgment
that
they
pass
in
this
case
consistent
with
the
judgment
that's
been
passed
or
will
be
passed
on
any
other
human
being
convicted
of
this
crime,
that
they
somehow
will
look
at
all
the
facts
of
this
case
come
out
with
circumstances
that
warrant
the
death
penalty
and
impose
it.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
yes
it
is
vastly,
vastly
different.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
am
talking
also,
mr.
chief
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
yes,
the
function
is
vastly
different
and
explicitly
stated
by
california
and
arkansas
to
be
different.
when
a
jury
passes
on
a
question
of
negligence,
they
go
in
and
they
hear
the
evidence
on
both
sides.
and
the
judge
said
to
them,
“ladies
and
gentlemen
in
the
jury,
if
you
find
that
the
defendant
failed
to
exercise
toward
the
plaintiff,
that
amount
of
care
that
a
reasonable
man
would
have
exercised,
you
must
find
for
the
plaintiff.”
now,
of
course
reasonable
man
is
a
standard,
which
is
not
as
specific
as
section
3355
of
the
revenue
code,
but
it
does
direct
the
jury's
attention
to
an
issue.
it
is
a
very
different
question
from
saying
to
the
jury
if
you
find
that
the
plaintiff
should
win
this
case,
you
should
find
for
the
plaintiff.
at
least,
telling
them
that
the
defendant
must
exercise
care,
which
a
reasonable
man
would
exercise,
let's
them
go
back
and
talk
about
something,
one
juror
can
say
to
another
juror,
“well,
what
is
the
amount
of
care
that
in
this
particular
automobile
case,
a
reasonable
man
would
have
exercised?”
it
is
more
than
the
amount
of
care
that
has
to
be
exercise
with
regard
to
a
trespasser
and
less
than
the
amount
of
care
that
has
to
be
exercised
with
regard
to
--
for
example
somebody
to
whom
you
owe
a
special
duty
of
care.
the
whole
up
is
based
on
making
those
kinds
of
distinctions,
and
the
fact
that
not
anyone
of
them
will
bring
you
out,
computer-like
to
a
conclusion,
doesn't
mean
that
there
aren't
standards
involved
there.
when
the
jury
goes
out
to
talk
about
the
death
penalty
in
a
rape
case
in
arkansas,
they
can't
ask
whether
or
not
it's
reasonable
to
impose
a
death
penalty
or
anything
else,
when
juror
may
vote
for
the
death
penalty,
because
the
defendant
was
black
and
the
victim
was
white.
and
i
think
this
is
a
very
important
matter
also
in
describing
the
function
mr.
chief
justice.
it
would
shock
me
and
it
would
demonstrate,
i
think
that
our
entire
court
system
is
not
functioning
at
all.
if
you
did
a
study
of
cases
in
which
plaintiffs
had
sued
defendants
and
juries
had
come
up
with
a
verdict,
in
negligence
cases.
and
you
found
that
there
was
no
correlation,
whatever,
ascertainable
between
the
facts
of
the
case
and
the
juries
verdicts.
i
think
that
you
would
find
and
inevitably
find
that
the
higher
the
rate
the
speed
of
the
car
with
which
the
defendant
hit
the
plaintiff
or
the
murkier
than
night
on
which
it
was
occurring,
or
the
worst
of
breaks
the
more
you're
going
to
find
plaintiffs
recovering
the
defendants.
such
a
study
was
done
in
arkansas.
three
factors
emerged
that
characterized
the
cases,
in
which
persons
get
the
death
penalty:
race,
the
commission
of
contemporaneous
offense,
a
prior
record
of
imprisonment.
a
prior
record
of
imprisonment
may
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
jury's
determination
rationally
of
it,
because
a
jury
ordinarily
doesn't
know
about
a
prior
record.
so
that
i
think
that
both
in
legal
theory
and
in
fact,
this
is
a
very
different
business
from
the
juries
going
out
and
in
a
negligence
case
in
saying,
“well,
did
that
defendant
have
a
duty
of
care?
what
was
that
duty
of
care?
did
he
act
the
way
a
reasonable
man
would
act?”
in
arkansas,
none
of
those
questions
need
to
be
asked,
and
in
performance
the
juries
do
very
different
things.
in
the
one
case
the
jury
acts
consistently
with
a
pattern,
a
system
defined
by
law
and
ordained
by
law,
and
in
death
sentencing
juries
act
simply,
except
for
the
factor
of
race,
irrationally.
now,
the
question
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
mr.
justice
harlan
this
is
one
of
those
questions
of
history
that
turn
on
what
your
personal
point
of
view
is.
i
would
put
it
this
way
from
my
personal
point
of
view
that
it
became
simply
intolerable
for
society
to
uniformly
sentence
to
death,
the
total
number
of
people
convicted
of
any
offense.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
no
there
isn't,
there
is
not.
it
simply
--
we
know
as
a
phenomenon
that
at
some
point
of
time,
legislatures
in
large
numbers
began
to
take
the
mandatory
death
penalty
off
the
book
and
replace
it
with
the
discretionary
form.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
no,
mr.
justice
black
our
argument
would
be
vastly
different.
what
arkansas
had
prior
to
allowing
jury's
discretion
was
a
mandatory
death
sentence
for
all
persons
convicted
of
a
crime.
now,
mandatory
death
sentences
would
raise
serious
constitutional
questions,
but
they
are
not
the
constitutional
questions
of
this
case.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
think
they
would
raise
a
very
serious
question
--
i'm
sorry.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
think
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
there
may
be
procedural
questions,
but
in
terms
of
the
major
question,
i
think
cruel
and
unusual
is
the
only
question
that
it
might
raise.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
no,
you
would
not.
you
wouldn't
have
two
issues
to
try,
so
you
wouldn't
have
a
single
verdict
issue,
you'd
only
have
a
single
issue
and
of
course
there's
no
discretion.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
quite
agree.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
that's
very,
very
difficult
to
say.
i
cannot
say
that
courts
have
exercised
judicial
review
of
a
death
sentence
in
more
than
11
or
12
jurisdictions.
now,
there
are
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
arkansas
has
its
statute,
it's
been
pointed
out,
it's
4323-10,
i
believe.
in
arkansas,
which
says
and
this
is
common
in
united
states,
this
is
where
i
have
to
give
an
uncertain
answer.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
no,
there
you
have
to
distinguish
between
trial
judges
and
appellate
judges
(voice
overlap).
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
trial
judges?
i
would
guess
eight
to
ten
states.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
yes.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
a
relatively
recent
innovation
and
it
takes
three
different
forms,
which
one
has
to
watch
out
for,
but
i
don't
think
they
make
much
difference.
one
is
that
the
judges
charge,
this
is
the
maryland
situation,
a
judge
is
charged
with
actually
passing
the
sentence
when
the
jury
has
made
a
recommendatory
body,
but
as
a
matter
of
practice,
the
judge
almost
fall
as
a
jury.
the
only
known
version,
a
very
recent
thing
is
that
judge
and
jury
must
concur,
that
it
puts
the
initial
on
a
signboard.
they
both
independently
and
infuriately
have
to
come
out
with
a
judgment.
then
the
third
is
a
form
that's
a
little
older,
but
still
i
think
largely
a
recent
innovation,
that
says
if
the
judge
may
set
aside
a
jury
verdict,
even
though
he
finds
no
error
in
it,
but
if
he
simply
disagrees
with
the
penalty
imposed.
now,
it's
the
latter
form
that
is
very
difficult
to
determine
by
head
count.
how
many
states
have,
because
there
are
number
of
states,
which
for
example
arkansas
has
a
statute
that
seems
to
give
a
judge
the
power
to
reduce
jury
sentences?
now,
it's
couched
in
language
that
i
do
not
think
it
applies
to
capital
cases.
there
has
never
been
a
case,
in
which
the
arkansas
supreme
court
had
said
that
it
implies
to
capital
cases.
and
in
the
last
argument
here,
counsel
for
the
state
say
he
knew
of
no
cases
in
which
a
judge
ever
done
that.
and
i
made
inquiry
of
arkansas
counsel,
and
we
know
of
no
case,
in
which
the
judges
ever
done
it.
so,
i
would
deny
that
in
arkansas,
there
is
such
a
thing.
but
one
couldn't,
by
looking
at
the
statute
books
of
the
states
come
out
with.
the
general
practice
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
am
confident
is
that
there
is
no
judicial
review.
in
some
states,
we
know
there
is.
in
california,
we
know
there
is.
not
by
statute
but
because
the
california
supreme
court
said
so.
but
in
most
jurisdictions,
i
would
think
there
was
not.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
it
certainly
does
mr.
chief
justice
and
indeed
my
whole
position
is
that
they
ought
to
do
that.
i'm
not
suggesting
for
one
moment
that
this
court
ought
to
set
standards
or
that
this
court
ought
to
review
any
legislative
judgment.
no
legislative
judgment
has
been
made,
except
the
legislative
judgment
that
no
judgment
can
be
made.
and
i
am
asking
this
court
to
determine
whether
it
is
consistent
with
the
rule
of
law,
which
is
fundamental
to
due
process
for
the
legislatures
to
say,
we
are
going
to
kill
people
and
we
are
not
going
to
undertake
an
investigation
to
determine
which
classes
of
people
should
live,
and
which
classes
of
people
should
die.
we're
not
going
to
set
down
rules,
we're
simple
going
to
let
a
jury
determine
like
rolling
the
dice,
which
person
is
going
to
live
and
which
person
is
going
to
die.
i
concede
the
benefits
of
legislative
judgment
view
and
a
ruling
by
this
court,
that
lawlessness
in
the
process
of
killing
people
is
unconstitutional
will
precisely
put
back
to
the
legislature
the
kind
of
question
that
it
is
uniquely
fitted
to
deal
with.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
it
is
indeed
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
(voice
overlap)
question,
but
the
courts
review
of
that
question
is
a
different
matter
than
reviewing
a
legislature's
judgment
as
to
standards,
because
neither
facts?
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
no,
i'm
not
sure
that
the
legislature
has
made
that
judgment.
i'm
not
sure
that
the
legislature
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
am
asking
this
court
to
say
that
standards
are
imperatively
required
under
the
constitution,
but
i'm
not
asking
you
to
review
a
judgment
of
a
legislature
that
standards
are
not
practicable,
which
is
i
thought
the
question
your
honor
asked.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
no,
no,
i
think
in
terms
of
what
least
left,
your
honor
later,
yes
i
think
that
the
legislatures
do
have
a
fairly
large
blank
check.
i
have
no
doubt
about
that.
the
primary
power
of
a
legislature
to
fix
sentences
or
offenses
is
a
very
broad
check
constitutionally,
there's
no
doubt
about
that.
this
court
has
a
very
limited
review
over
what
legislatures
do
in
determining
sentences,
as
is
it
a
very
limited
review
over
the
penological
judgment,
same
i
can
define
in
crimes.
the
only
power
that
this
court
has
to
enforce
the
constitution
and
the
only
that
i'm
asserting
the
constitution
requires
is
a
rule
of
law.
and
i
do
not
think
that
this
court
is
being
asked
thereby
to
review
any
legislative
judgments,
and
standards
are
not
practicable.
in
the
absence
of
somebody
asserting
to
a
legislature
that
they're
desirable
or
necessary,
we
don't
even
really
know
that
any
legislature
has
made
the
judgment
that
they're
impractical.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
mr.
chief
justice,
i
agree
with
that
and
i
will
admit
that
i
will
probably
be
among
the
people,
who
will
be
up
here
asserting
that.[laughter]
but
i
don't
think
that
that
is
the
question
as
before
the
court.
this
court
back
in
the
early
1930s
had
the
question
of
whether
or
not
a
city,
which
wanted
to
control
parading
on
its
streets.
it
could
simply
say,
“you
got
to
get
a
permit
from
the
chief
of
police.
it's
illegal
to
parade
without
a
permit,
get
a
permit,
and
you
can
parade.”
now
of
course,
it
was
a
fact
that
if
this
court
said,
“well,
standards
are
required
for
the
issuance
of
a
permit
that
25
years
or
30
years
of
litigation,
which
we
have
had
would
ensue
with
regard
to
what
the
kind
of
standards
should
be.”
now,
i
don't
know
how
much
litigation
is
going
ensue
from
a
decision
requiring
standards.
but
i
do
know
that
the
only
question
before
the
court
at
this
point
is
a
question
was
before
the
court
back
in
1930
in
the
permit
case,
whether
any
kinds
of
standards
are
required.
a
legislature
may
do
a
very
good
job,
and
this
court
may
be
able
to
decide
within
a
year
or
two
years
that
the
standards
which
have
been
defined
are
adequate.
it
may
do
a
very
bad
job,
and
certainly
the
standards
will
be
challengeable.
it
is
a
very
function
of
the
rule
of
law
that
have
things
that
can
be
tested
legally,
that's
what
we
don't
now
have
and
that's
what
we're
contending.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
would
regard
that
as
a
standard
and
far
better
than
what
arkansas
has,
but
i
would
not
regard
it
as
an
adequate
standard.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
no
i
don't
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
have
indeed,
and
i
do.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
believe
that
the
court
will
not
be
setting
its
foot
on
a
primrose
path,
if
it
demands
that
the
states
set
some
standards
for
the
penalty
determination.
i
believe
that
statutes
are
draftable,
which
will
provide
adequate
constitutional
standards.
i
say
that
in
view
of
two
major
considerations.
first,
i
think
we
already
had
some
models.
i
think
that
the
ali
model
penal
code,
model
for
a
capital
punishment
statute,
although
i
might
not
agree
with
all
of
its
details
is
a
workable
model.
secondly,
again
i'd
like
to
advert,
if
i
may
to
the
history
of
the
court's
experience
in
dealing
with
ordinances,
it
regulates
parades
in
that
certain
time.
i
think
it
might
have
been
arguable,
and
it
might
have
looked
very
plausible
before
this
court's
decision
in
1938
in
lovell
and
griffin,
to
say
that
you
could
not
draft
an
ordinance,
that
would
take
account
of
all
of
the
imponderables
that
had
to
do
with
the
question
of
whether
or
not
you
would
let
a
parade
go
down
the
street.
you
have
to
worry
about
traffic,
you
have
to
worry
about
crowd
control,
you
have
to
worry
about
the
availability
of
police,
you
have
to
worry
about
emergency
vehicles,
you
have
to
worry
about
a
thousand
contingencies.
nevertheless,
it
was
not
three
years
after
this
court's
decision
in
lovell
versus
griffin,
requiring
standards,
that
this
court
sustained
a
statute
as
a
having
standards
in
cox
in
new
hampshire
in
1941.
and
the
fact
that
there's
been
30
years
of
experience
in
which
this
court
has
had
to
knock
down
various
ordinances
for
lack
of
standards
it's
not
because
it
was
impossible
to
draft
standards,
but
simply
because
there
was
a
willful
refusal
to
comply
with
what
this
court
demand.
and
i
say
willful
advisably,
because
the
considerations
that
kept
open-handed
discretion
in
the
hands
of
police
chiefs
to
regulate
parades
is
very
much
the
same
thing
that
is
being
given
to
juries
in
capital
punishment.
there
is
simply
feeling
that
if
you
really
brought
up
to
the
surface
and
articulated
the
considerations
that
the
legislature
was
attending
to
effect
juries,
like
race,
they
wouldn't
stand
the
light
of
debt.
now,
i
think
that
it
is
possible
to
draft
a
statute,
which
will
withstand
the
constitutional
scrutiny
of
this
court.
and
i
think
that
insistence
by
this
court
that
the
legislature
address
itself,
tearing
its
undoubtedly
greater
wisdom,
and
it's
undoubtedly
more
appropriate
penological
judgment
to
that
question
will
advance,
the
cause
of
the
drafting
of
adequate
statutes.
i
think
that
if
this
court
hadn't
decided
in
lovell
and
griffin
that
it
was
necessary,
the
legislatures
never
would
have
caught.
now,
that
they've
tired,
they've
succeeded.
i
think
that
if
this
court
insist
that
the
rule
of
law
requires
the
drafting
of
standards
in
this
area,
that
it
will
be
possible
to
do,
and
i
think
that
the
model
penal
code,
although
i
have
some
questions
about
details
of
it,
and
although
it's
applicable
to
murder
and
not
to
rape
is
a
fair
example
of
what
legislatures
can
do
if
they
try.
now,
there
is
--
though
i
think
a
second
answer
to
that
question.
if
i
were
to
conclude
that
it
was
impossible
to
draft
a
statute
which
would
impose
the
rule
of
law
on
a
decision,
whether
or
not
men
should
live
or
die.
so,
that
it
was
impossible
to
reconcile
the
basic
requirement
of
lawfulness
in
proceedings
with
the
death
penalty,
i
have
no
doubt
which
of
the
two
institutions,
the
constitution
say
should
prevail.
if
the
cause
of
a
system
of
capital
punishment
is
lawlessness
in
its
administration,
the
constitution
forbids
that
kind
of
lawlessness.
and
that
causes
me
to
revert
to
what
i
think
is
essentially
wrong
with
arkansas'
procedure
for
determining
who
lives
and
who
dies
in
a
capital
case.
that
is
a
decision,
as
i
have
said
which
is
not
the
dispensation
of
mercy.
on
this
record
it
appears
that
less
than
a
quarter
of
the
total
number
of
persons
convicted
of
a
crime
of
rape
are
sentenced
to
death,
and
that
appears
to
be
a
very
high
figure.
the
general
statistics
that
are
available,
and
we
put
them
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief
and
they
have
a
great
deal
of
trouble
analytically,
but
nevertheless
one
can
draw
some
implications
from
it,
the
general
statistics
that
are
available
appear
to
show
that
not
more
than
10%
of
people
convicted
of
capital
rape
were
in
fact
sentenced
to
die,
and
that
for
murder,
it
may
be
up
in
a
neighborhood
of
20%.
now,
the
process
by
which
jurors
take,
out
of
all
the
persons
convicted
of
a
like
harm,
one-tenth
or
one-fifth
of
those
persons
and
subject
them
to
the
most
extreme
penalty
known
to
our
law
has
got
to
be
under
the
constitution
i
submit,
a
rational,
regular,
and
lawful
process.
i
do
not
think
that
this
court
for
one
moment
would
sustain
a
state
enactment
of
a
statute
that
said
that
out
of
every
five
persons
convicted
of
murder,
and
out
of
every
ten
persons
convicted
of
rape,
they
shall
meet
in
the
state
penitentiary
and
draw
straws
to
see
who
will
die.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
think
this
is
worst
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
yes
it
is,
because
there
it
is
every
bit
as
arbitrary
in
that,
the
factors
which
determine
whether
or
not
a
person
lives
or
dies.
although
there
are
subject
to
the
appraisal
of
a
particular
jury
rather
than
a
straw
or
the
dice
are
not
subject
to
that
jury's
consideration
in
light
of
any
rules
that
are
applied
in
this
case
and
the
next.
there
is
no
assurance
that
what
makes
this
jury
sentence
this
man
to
death
pick
him
from
nine
or
ten
other
people
exactly
like
it,
responds
to
any
rule
applied
at
any
other
ends
case,
where
there
it
will
be
applied
in
any
other
man's
case.
and
what's
worst
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
mr.
justice
black,
i
don't
think
one
can
fairly
draw
that
inference,
and
i'll
tell
you
two
reasons
why
i
think
one
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
because
we
have
examined
that
factors
that
bring
about
death
verdicts
in
the
state
of
arkansas,
and
we
have
not
found
in
any
of
the
characteristics
that
you
or
i
or
twelve
jurors
could
agree,
made
those
cases,
bad
cases,
in
fact,
bring
about
the
death
verdict.
what
we
found
is,
if
there
are
three
factors
that
show
up
in
death
cases
as
this
thing,
which
from
my
cases,
race,
prior
imprisonment
which
the
jury
doesn't
know
about,
unless
the
defendant
forgoes
this
privilege
and
takes
the
stand;
and
commission
of
a
contemporaneous
offense,
which
didn't
happen
in
maxwell's
case.
so,
that
i
think
that
if
you
examined
the
performance
of
juries,
you
must
conclude
that
they
are
not
in
fact,
reserving
the
death
penalty
for
the
most
serious
kinds
of
offenses
or
a
particularly
bad
kind
of
offense.
they
are
applying
it
in
fact,
in
light
of
those
factors
randomly,
exactly
the
way
a
roll
of
the
dice
would.
but
what
they
are
doing
is
worst
than
that,
because
the
dice
at
least
don't
discriminate
racially
in
arkansas
juries
do.
at
least
with
the
dice,
a
black
man
would
have
an
even
chance
of
getting
the
death
penalty
with
a
white
male.
and
in
fact
in
arkansas,
50%
of
the
black
chart
of
interracial
rate
get
the
death
penalty
and
14%
of
persons
charged
with
intra-racial
case
get
the
death
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
they're
not
of
record
mr.
justice
black.
we
have
put
in
our
brief
however,
every
statistic
that
has
ever
been
produced,
which
the
court
can't
properly,
judicially
notice,
and
everyone
points
to
the
same
conclusion.
we
have
other
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
pardon
me,
mr.
justice?
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i'm
talking
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
oh!
i
think
it
does
mr.
justice
black.
i
think
it
enters
into
the
matters
in
all
of
the
states.
and
that's
exactly
why
we
argue
for
a
constitutional
ruling,
it's
applicable
to
all
the
states.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
would
say
that
the
constitution
forbids
arbitrary
discretion
in
the
hands
of
the
judge,
as
it
does
with
the
jury.
but,
again
i
can
see
a
distinction
between
the
two
cases,
and
i
believe
that
a
holding
with
regard
to
juries
would
not
necessarily
apply
with
regard
to
judges.
again,
i
do
not
think
that
giaccio
versus
pennsylvania,
which
says
that
a
jury
can't
have
an
utterly
freehand
in
setting
cost.
it
means
that
the
judge
doesn't
have
a
freehand
in
setting
cost
in
cases.
i
think
that
the
fact
that
you
have
12
men
brought
in
for
a
particular
occasion,
who
are
not
professional
sentencers,
who
do
not
have
even
the
consistency
of
their
own
performance
from
case
to
case
to
guide
them
creates
a
different
background
for
the
exercise
of
that
discretion,
and
therefore,
it
may
be
constitutionally
impermissible
to
give
it
a
jury,
but
not
to
a
judge.
my
own
view
that
it's
equally
bad
to
give
it
to
a
judge,
but
i
don't
think
that
issue
is
presented
in
this
case.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
the
rule
for
which
we're
contending
in
this
case
is
limited
to
capital
cases.
again,
i
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
on
several
grounds,
the
most
significant
one,
i
think
is
simply
that,
where
more
is
at
stake
for
the
defendant,
the
requirements
of
due
process
for
a
regularized
decision-making
procedure
are
more
exact
then.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
no,
i
quite
agree,
but
there
we
have
a
first
amendment
concern,
as
well.
i
think
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
mr.
justice
white,
i
--
my
own
personal
position
again
would
be
that
standards
are
required
of
juries
and
of
judges
in
non-capital
sentencing
under
the
constitution.
but
i
think
that
since
skinner
and
oklahoma,
it
has
been
cleared
that
this
court
has
drawn
a
distinction.
in
skinner,
the
court
said
that
you
couldn't
sterilize
thieves,
unless
you
sterilize
embezzlers.
now,
nobody
has
ever
argued
that
you
can't
punish
theft
by
15
years
of
imprisonment,
and
punish
embezzlement
by
10.
those
kinds
of
penological
judgments
are
simply
of
a
different
order
of
magnitude
in
the
choice
of
life
or
death,
and
the
court
has
required
different
degrees
of
regularity
in
the
procedures,
and
even
handedness
in
the
procedures
from
posing
the
penalties.
a
second
consideration
and
i
think
is
vitally
important
is
this
one.
when
you
are
talking
about
non-capital
sentences,
you
have
a
consideration
that
just
doesn't
enter
into
the
equation,
when
you
talk
about
capital
sentences,
that
the
rehabilitative
aspects.
now,
i
am
not
ascertain,
i'll
make
this
very
clear
that
the
constitution
requires
that
states
take
rehabilitation
into
account,
in
their
sentencing.
but
i
am
asserting
that
inevitably
states
do
take
rehabilitation
into
account,
for
a
simple
fact
that
if
you
send
a
fellow
away
to
prison,
he's
going
to
come
out,
and
everybody
wants
to
come
out,
better
of
it
than
worse
from
the
point
of
view
of
society.
now,
we
simply
do
not
have
the
calibers
of
this
stage
of
a
science
to
reduce
the
rehabilitation
factor
to
categorical
judgments,
which
permit
themselves
to
be
articulated
in
standards.
when
you
make
the
decision,
however,
to
sentence
a
man
to
die,
instead
of
to
live,
you're
making
a
decision,
to
take
him
out
of
the
rehabilitative
regime
entirely.
and
that
kind
of
standard
it
seem
to
me,
can't
barrel
the
benefits
of
what
we
don't
know
about
rehabilitation.
so
i
think
that
again,
non-capital
sentencing
has
a
factor,
it
has
a
wild
card,
it
has
a
joke
that
justifies
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
no
i
don't
--
again,
mr.
justice
white,
i
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
think
that
it's
of
a
rational
line
to
draw,
that
the
court
could
say
that
where
rehabilitation
is
an
issue,
that
a
great
deal
of
torments
will
be
allowed
because
of
the
imprecision
of
the
art
of
sentencing
and
the
right
of
rehabilitation.
my
own
view
is
not
that,
but
i
think
it's
a
logical
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
it
would
be
midway
between
due
care
and
what
we
have
in
capital
sentencing,
because
at
least
the
focus
would
be
on
something
rehabilitation,
and
that's
exactly
what
is
wrong
with
the
arkansas
procedure.
it
is
unclear,
whether
a
jury
which
goes
back,
unclear
to
anyone
of
those
called
jurors,
whether
he
is
to
take
for
example
the
possible
reformation
of
the
defendant
into
a
capital
deciding
whether
he
shall
live
or
die.
it
is
perfectly
consistent
for
one
jury
to
ask
himself
the
question,
“well,
is
this
man
rehabilitative?
we're
going
to
sentence
him
to
death
only,
if
he's
not.”
another
juror
might
go
back
and
simply
ask
the
question,
“is
he
black,
and
was
he's
victim
white?”
another
one
might
go
back
and
ask
the
question,
“is
this
a
particularly
heinous
case
of
rape
in
one
sense
or
another?”
the
legislature
hasn't
even
focus
in
on
what
the
genuine
purpose
of
capital
punishment,
so
that
the
jurors
can
talk
meaningfully
about
it.
and
jurors
from
case
to
case
can
act
meaningfully
in
light
of,
some
general
purpose
for
capital
punishment.
now,
the
black-white
business
has
one
additional
very
important
factor,
a
very
important
implication
in
this
case
that
emerges
from
this
court's
decision
in
pearce
versus
north
carolina.
pearce
is
a
decision
in
which
this
court
has
required
standards
for
sentencing,
where
a
particular
kind
of
danger
was
perceived,
and
that
was
the
danger
that
a
judge
viewing
of
the
defendant's
access
on
appeal
with
this
favor
would
be
vindictive
and
penalizing
for
that.
it
would
to
me
be
an
anomaly
of
a
highest
degree
if
this
court
were
willing
to
exact
the
more
demanding
requirement
of
pearce,
not
simply
that
there'll
be
standards
for
the
decision,
but
the
reasons
for
the
application
of
those
standards
be
articulated.
where
the
risk
is
--
and
although
i
think
there
is
a
risk,
i
think
it's
not
a
terribly
great
one,
that
a
judge
would
be
vindictive,
and
not
to
require
standards,
where
the
danger
is
that
a
person
will
be
sentenced
to
death
on
account
of
his
race,
where
in
arkansas
specifically
and
in
this
country
generally,
everybody
who
has
examined
this
question
has
concluded,
that
in
fact
jurors
are
racially
discriminating
in
the
imposition
of
the
death
penalty.
but
danger
of
that,
of
a
flagrant
and
otherwise
unprevalent
violation
of
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
constitution,
should
require
this
court
to
assure
that
the
procedure
comes
up
to
visibility,
in
a
way
in
which
that
racial
factor
will
not
have
the
effect
that
we
know
it
now
has
in
capital
sentence.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
yes,
mr.
justice
white
for
two
reasons.
first
of
all,
i
am
not
only
talking
about
the
kind
of
discrimination
that
occurs
from
perverse
and
willful
disregard
of
a
legal
requirement.
in
arkansas,
a
juror
might
believe
that
it
is
legal
and
permissible
and
the
charge
he's
given
to
take
account
of
the
fact
that
the
defendant
is
black
and
the
victim
is
white,
and
that
at
least
would
be
flushed
out.
jurors
would
not
openly
be
able
to
say
to
each
other,
“let
us
sentence
this
man
to
death,
because
he
was
black
and
his
victim
as
white.”
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
think
that
any
instruction
would
help.
i
think
that
an
instruction
to
that
effect
would
help,
but
then
we
get
into
the
second
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
no,
i
think
it
would
not.
and
the
reason
for
that
is
this,
i
think
the
juries
may
well
discriminate
on
account
of
race
and
find
the
defendant
is
guilty
of
crimes,
as
well
as
you
convict
him,
but
there
all
sorts
of
judicial
methods
of
control
that
are
available
there,
that
are
not
available
in
the
absence
of
standards.
the
only
way
in
which
a
judge
can
determine,
whether
there's
a
rational
basis
in
the
record,
whether
the
jury
could
have
decided
to
impose
a
death
penalty
on
this
case,
on
any
other
ground
than
race,
is
if
there's
some
standards.
there
is
no
doubt
that
if
all
the
other
factors,
which
allowed
the
imposition
of
the
death
penalty,
under
appropriate
standards
existed
in
the
case,
the
jury
might
still
discriminate
on
account
of
race,
as
they
may
now
in
finding
guilt,
if
the
evidence
is
insufficient
to
make
out
all
of
the
elements
of
the
crime.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
am
afraid
my
time
is
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
mr.
chief
justice
i
thank
you
and
i
shall.
i
simply
would
want
to
imply
whether
there's
also
any
purpose
in
my
addressing
myself
to
the
witherspoon
point.
i
think
witherspoon
is
open
and
shut
on
this
record,
and
i
would
prefer
to
--
unless
the
court
has
questions
in
connection
with
witherspoon,
simply
pretermit
discussion
of
that.
seven
jurors
were
excluded
they
are
pretty
(voice
overlap)
witherspoon.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
fine.
now,
again
with
regard
with
the
split
verdict
issue,
i
want
to
make
very
clear
that
we
are
not
relying
on
some
general
notion
of
fairness,
which
is
to
be
spelled
out
in
due
process
clause
of
the
constitution.
we
are
relying
in
this
case
on
what
i
think
is
a
palpable
inconsistency
between
the
federally
protected
privilege
against
self-incrimination
of
the
defendant,
and
is
equally
protected
set
of
federal
constitutional
rights
in
assuring
a
rational
sentencing
decision.
those
latter
rights
include:
right
to
a
hearing
on
a
question
which
is
as
considerable
as
the
question
of
life
or
death,
and
the
opportunity
to
present
defensive
evidence
addressed
to
that
question.
now
in
a
single
verdict
trial,
a
defendant
who,
like
william
maxwell,
exercises
his
constitutional
privilege
against
self-incrimination
allows
the
jury
to
decide
whether
he
shall
live
or
die,
without
presenting
a
slightest
bit
of
evidence
relevant
to
the
choice
of
life
or
death,
except
the
evidence
that
comes
in
on
the
guilt
issue.
now
again,
i
am
not
asserting
and
it
is
not
the
basis
of
our
constitutional
submission
that
a
state
is
constitutionally
precluded
from
permitting
the
decision
as
to
life
or
death
to
be
made
on
the
facts
of
the
offence
if
the
state
does
that,
but
the
state
of
arkansas
does
not
do
that.
it
is
very
clear
that
the
state
of
arkansas
permits
the
decision
as
to
life
or
death
to
be
made
on
a
broad
basis,
including
background
information,
and
any
other
material
that
may
in
the
unfetter
discretion
of
the
jury
affects
it's
choice.
now
this
means
that
a
defendant
is
paid
a
very
high
price
for
giving
up
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
if
he
chooses
either
to
plead
guilty
and
limit
the
trial
to
the
issue
of
punishment
or
to
take
the
stand,
raise
all
of
the
question
of
background,
talk
to
the
jurors,
show
them
that
he
is
a
human
being,
show
them
that
he
has
a
voice,
explain
what
led
him
to
what
he
did,
and
asked
for
mercy,
in
light
of
those
considerations.
he
stands
a
far
better
chance
that
the
decision
will
be
made
on
a
full
and
rational
basis,
than
if
he
is
simply
exercises
his
privilege
and
does
not
testify.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i'm
sorry
mr.
justice
harlan
we
do
see
the
right
of
allocution
as
sort
of
a
comprehensive
summary
of
what
we
think
the
constitution
entitles
the
defendant
to
any
capital
case.
again,
we
quarrel
with
the
observations
of
this
court
in
hill
that
in
certain
kinds
of
cases,
allocution
may
not
arise
in
constitutional
dimensions.
what
we
say
is
that
in
a
capital
case,
where
allocution
has
been
historically
recognized
as
far
more
significant,
where
more
is
at
stake
for
the
defendant,
where
the
practice
not
only
precludes,
as
the
arkansas
practice
touch,
is
talking
to
the
jury,
but
is
presenting
any
evidence
or
his
counsel
even
meaningfully
arguing
that
issue,
in
light
of
a
full
record,
that
the
constitution
does
require
more
allocution
than
the
arkansas
procedure
allows
to
a
fellow
who
claims
his
privilege.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
it
does
not,
if
the
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
there
is
no
right
of
allocution
in
a
capital
case.
the
issue
is
submitted
to
jury
on
both
guilt
and
punishment
after
trial
of
guilt
face.
the
defendant
has
no
opportunity
to
make
a
statement,
either
of
technical
allocution
in
order
to
present
any
evidence
that
goes
to
sentencing
as
such
after
verdict.
now,
he
might
present
evidence
relevant
to
sentencing
before
a
verdict,
with
all
that
implies
for
giving
up
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
and
prejudicing
himself
on
the
guilt
issue.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
it
would
help,
but
i
don't
think
it
would
satisfy
the
constitutional
requirement,
because
there
would
still
be.
i
don't
know
what
that
such
a
rule
would
do
for
impeachment
for
example,
because
i
assume
that
his
credibility
would
be
an
issue,
with
regard
to
even
those
factors
that
he
spoke,
simply
going
to
mitigation.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
think
that
it
should
be
an
issue,
most
assuredly
and
therefore,
if
he
were
permitted
to
make
such
a
statement,
after
the
jury
had
determined
guilt.
i
would
have
no
problem,
but
the
difficulty
is
in
arkansas,
impeachment
involves
the
admission
against
the
defendant
of
literally
every
bad
act
in
his
life.
and
i
think
that
again,
the
tension
that's
created,
that
would
persuade
the
defendant
not
to
take
the
stand,
to
give
up
his
right
to
speak
in
mitigation,
because
of
the
tremendously
prejudicial
impact
to
that
on
the
guilt
phase
would
be
constitutionally
intolerable.
however,
that
again
is
not
this
case,
although
i
would
have
my
constitutional
doubts
about
that,
the
court
doesn't
even
have
to
reach
that
question
again
as
in
the
question
of
standards.
what
we
have
here
is
an
arkansas
procedure,
which
permits
arbitrariness
and
irrationality
by
giving
no
standards
to
the
jury
in
sentencing.
and
then
virtually
requires
that
the
decision
be
arbitrary,
if
the
defendant
doesn't
take
the
stand,
because
there's
simply
no
basis
for
the
juries
determining
the
facts
relevant
to
the
critical
sentencing
decision.
now,
any
of
those
factors
are
changed,
we
have
a
different
constitutional
case.
what
we
have
in
arkansas
is
the
irrational
trial
process
at
its
worst.
if
i
may
reserve
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
no,
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
no,
and
that
is
what
creates
the
constitutional
dilemma,
if
the
state
could
do
that,
whether
or
not
the
defendant
testify,
then
you
would
not
have
the
tension
between
constitutional
rights.
but
the
defendant
subject
himself
to
that
only
if
he
makes
character
an
issue
or
if
he
testifies.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
would
like
to
speak
to
questions
of
arkansas
law
that
came
up
and
not
reopen
the
constitutional
questions.
first,
with
regard
to
mr.
justice
brennan's
question,
we
have
dealt
at
pages
66
through
69
of
our
brief
with
the
kind
of
evidence
that
comes
in
from
impeachment
and
that
sort
of
thing.
it
is
indeed
very
broad,
for
example
the
right
case
we
mentioned
here,
in
which
the
rape
defendant
was
asked
whether
several
persons
had
not
told
him
to
quit
hanging
around
their
places
of
business,
because
he
made
indecent
proposals
to
women?
that's
the
kind
of
thing.
and
there
is
one
limitation
though,
i
don't
want
to
say
there
are
no
limitations.
apparently,
if
in
a
negative
act,
the
bad
act,
an
evil
act
is
not
reduced
to
conviction
and
it's
too
remote,
it
may
not
be
shown,
but
what
that
means
we
don't
know.
a
20-year
old
liquor,
misdemeanor
liquor
violations
have
come
in
to
impeach.
so
really
even
that,
it's
just
no
limitations
and
the
answer
is,
that
in
effect,
it
is
the
whole
defendant's
life
on
rebuttal
for
impeachment
if
he
takes
the
stand.
now,
with
regard
to
--mr.
justice
harlan
asked
at
one
point,
whether
the
jury
had
to
be
unanimous
in
arkansas,
the
answer
that
mr.
langston
gave,
as
i
understand
it
was
that
they
did,
but
i
want
to
make
clear
that
it
has
to
be
unanimous
either
way,
not
the
kind
of
situation
you
have
in
california,
where
one
juror
can
prevent
a
death
penalty.
if
the
jury
hangs,
the
jury
is
discharged
and
they
try
the
case
again.
and
that
also,
i
want
to
make
clear,
it
tends
to
point
the
way
the
construction
of
this
statute
that
mr.
langston
has
twice
mentioned,
this
43-2310,
which
he
said
gives
trial
courts
the
power
to
set
aside
verdict
on
the
ground
that
they
don't
--
they
find
outrageous
which
some
such
thing
a
jury
death
verdict.
to
start
with,
i
don't
think
the
statute
allows
that,
it
predates
the
1915
statute,
which
crease
discretion
in
capital
cases,
and
would
seem
to
apply
in
non-capital
cases
only.
there
is
in
other
statute
that
the
court
might
want
to
look
at,
which
is
43-2306,
which
provides
that
when
a
jury
find
the
verdict
of
guilt
and
failed
to
agree
on
the
punishment
or
do
not
declare
such
punishment,
and
the
judge
renders
judgment.
now,
mr.
langston
admits
that
doesn't
apply
in
capital
cases,
plays
in
the
same
terms
as
the
power
to
reduce
the
verdict.
and
the
reason
it
does
is
for
the
same
reason
that
43-2310
does
it.
it
was
inactive
before
the
1915
statute.
it
was
no
designed
to
deal
with
capital
cases.
now,
i'm
not
asserting
here
as
a
matter
of
arkansas
law,
i
can
tell
you
that
that's
statute
doesn't
give
judges
the
power
to
set
aside
verdicts.
it
doesn't
look
that
way.
and
i
have
asked
questions
of
arkansas
lawyers,
as
well
as
to
whether
they
know
of
any
case
in
which
a
judge
has
done
so,
and
the
answer
has
been
no.
when
mr.
langston
was
asked
the
question
last
time
up
in
oral
argument,
he
may
say
he
didn't
think
they
ever
done
so.
now,
i'm
not
denying
that
they
may
have
done
so,
i
have
never
heard
of
it.
i
know
in
california
they
have
that
power
and
i
know
it
for
two
reasons.
one,
that
california
supreme
court
has
said
so
in
an
opinion,
and
two,
judge
phillips,
for
example
in
oakland
has
done
so.
and
i
can
name
the
judge,
and
i
can
name
the
time,
and
i
know
the
case.
in
arkansas
that
has
never
happen.
and
that
is
one
of
the
several
things
that
differentiates
arkansas
from
california.
most
of
the
things
we
have
heard
from
mr.
harris
seem
to
me
to
demonstrate
of
anything,
the
entire
lawlessness
of
the
procedure
in
arkansas.
california
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
yes,
sir.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
was
simply
going
to
reserve
for
a
california
case
mr.
justice
harlan,
whether
the
california
procedure
was
good
or
bad.
but
as
mr.
harris
has
told
us,
it
is
far
better
than
arkansas.
and
everything
he
says
about
what
california
has
done
suggest
the
deficiencies
in
the
arkansas
procedure.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
in
arkansas,
no.
the
arkansas
supreme
court,
that's
the
one
thing
about
arkansas
law
i
can
assert
clearly.
if
the
verdict,
if
the
conviction
is
not
supported
by
sufficient
evidence,
then
of
course,
the
court
will
set
aside
the
verdict.
and
if
that
means
for
example
that
if
the
evidence
only
makes
out
second
degree
that
a
death
penalty
based
on
first
degree
goes,
but
only
because
the
first
degree
conviction
is
upset.
as
long
as
the
evidence
is
sufficient
to
sustain
a
verdict
of
guilt
for
capital
offense,
the
arkansas
supreme
court
has
told
us
very
clearly
that
there
is
no
appellate
power
to
set
aside
a
jury
imposed
death
penalty.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
not
at
all,
california
is
the
most
populous
state
in
the
nation.
the
major
reason
for
the
most
people
there
is
there
are
most
crimes
there.
secondly,
governor
brown
didn't
execute
anybody
for
years.
the
reason
for
the
pile
up
on
death
row
has
virtually
nothing
to
do
with
the
stay
or
anything
else.
it
has
to
do
with
the
fact
that
there
was
a
governor
in
that
state
for
many
years
who
had
very
few
executions
go
on.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
think
they
require
more
analysis.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
except
the
race
figure.
mr.
justice
burger,
the
race
figure
is
reliable,
because
it
controls,
studies
has
been
done.
none
of
the
other
factors
are
reliable,
but
the
fact
that
black
people
are
consistently
sentenced
to
death
for
rape,
that's
reliable.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
yes,
the
20
years
study
done
in
the
state
of
arkansas
and
presented
in
the
record
in
this
case.
