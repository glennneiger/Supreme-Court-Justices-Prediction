justice
hugo
l.
black
and
as
i
understand
it,
to
date,
your
argument
would
be
the
same,
if
arkansas
had
never
changed
to
allowing
the
jury
to
exercise
its
discretion
with
reference
to
the
--
what
you
call
the
demand
for
standards.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
would
they
raise?
justice
hugo
l.
black
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
only
constitutional
question
raised,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
don't
think
if
this
is
like
cox,
do
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
do.
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
saying
exactly
like
even
if
you
are
not
on
the
jury,
you
didn't
hear
the
evidence,
those
jurors
are
suppose
to
have
some
knowledge
to
the
facts
of
life
and
evidently
they
--
well
their
opinion,
may
be
right
or
wrong,
they
will
depend
that
this
was
an
extraordinary
bad
case
of
rape?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
do
you
think
they
draw
that
interference?
justice
hugo
l.
black
have
you
looked
up
the
statistics
in
every
state
of
the
union
on
that
affecting
race
on
the
verdict
by
juries?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
reference
to
all
the
states?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
talking
about
was
reference
to
all
the
states,
are
you
saying
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
referred
to
arkansas
only,
are
you
saying
that
doesn't
--
that
never
enters
into
the
matter
in
other
state?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
he's
never
asked
the
defendant
to
say
anything,
in
connection
with
his
(voice
overlap).
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
talking
about
a
formal
allocution,
do
you
mean
that
he
never,
the
judge
who
tries
a
man,
before
he
sentence
him,
never
asked
him
or
gives
him
a
chance
to
say
anything
about
it
at
all?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
allocution.
he
does
ask?
justice
hugo
l.
black
can
a
judge
set
a
judgment
aside?
i
presume
he
can,
i
think
--
i
thought
he
could
never
stay
in
the
union.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
only
ground
that
it's
run
through
it,
are
the
weight
of
the
evidence.
can
he
set
aside
a
conviction
on
the
ground
that's
been
run
through
the
weight
of
the
evidence,
and
se
aside
this
sentence?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
think?
you
don't
know
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
conferred
on
the
weight
of
the
evidence.
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
many
states,
besides
california
have
different
theory
based
on
the
evidence,
with
reference
to
guilt
and
the
reference
to
sentence
presented?
justice
hugo
l.
black
on
a
different
trial?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
how
many
states,
besides
california
do
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
some
standards
in
addition,
the
standards
they
have
set
out
to
finding
the
crime.
justice
hugo
l.
black
mr.
harris,
may
i
ask
a
question?
justice
hugo
l.
black
we
have
vast
reports
about
how
many
they
are
in
death
row
in
california.
do
you
know
how
many
they
are?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
does
that
--
that
seems
to
be
a
great
many
more
than
any
in
the
other
states.
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
that
indicate
that
the
more
executions
in
california
than
in
other
states,
percentage
of
according
to
the
population?
how
do
you
know?
justice
hugo
l.
black
no
doubt
about
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
know
whether
been
any
effect
on
the
amount
of
death
sentences
by
dividing
it
up
that
you
do
between
the
original
trial
and
the
sentencing
trial?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
wonder
if
you
could
supply
us
of
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
maybe
you
could.
justice
hugo
l.
black
oh!
what
--
what,
as
you
experienced,
i'm
trying
to
pass
it
to
the
question.
justice
hugo
l.
black
talk
about
standard,
standard
of
course,
the
basic
standard
for
any
crime
is
the
death
admission
of
the
crime.
do
you
have
a
definition
in
your
state
for
offensive
rape?
now,
i
could
assume
that
the
no
purpose
for
standard,
except
to
try
divide
up
the
types
of
crime,
with
reference
to
that
atrocity,
that
ruthlessness,
defendant's
past
experience,
but
can
you
think
of
any
way
as
an
attorney
general
that
you
could
that
with
just
that
simply
saying
that
you've
got
to
divide
the
crime
of
rape
up
into
a
number
of
different
crimes
of
different
degrees
according
to
the
circumstances?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
can
you
define
standard
without
having
some
kind
of
a
step-by-step
as
to
enormity
of
the
crime
that
you
think
it's
been
committed?
and
how
can
you
get
that
in
any
language
that
could
be
administered
in
a
decent
way
of
the
court.
