justice
byron
r.
white
this
recent
practice
and
the
accumulation
of
this
from
experience.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
also
true,
mr.
amsterdam
in
the
non-death
cases,
the
jury
sentencing
in
other
cases,
likewise
of
relatively
recent
development?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
is
that
practiced
older
than
jury
sentencing
in
death
cases?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
the
non-capital
issue,
mr.
amsterdam,
whether
the
judge
or
the
jury
imposes
the
penalty
where
there
is
no
standard
to
guide
even
one
of
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
that's
what
you
said.
but
i
wonder
how
you
would
really
actually
distinguish
a
death
case
from
a
non-capital
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
of
course,
the
level
(inaudible)
or
anything
just
to
ask
a
question
whether
somebody
have
a
parade
on
the
street.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
you
got
possibly
like
the
prison
arrangement
penalty
from
a
year
to
life
sentence
and
no
standards,
whatsoever
to
guide
the
jury,
as
the
jury
sentencing
the
same
or
it
does
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you
would
say
that
a
non-capital
case
statement
simply
came
out
and
said
are
merely
and
punishment
is
serving
rehabilitative
goals
only
that
we
just
do
that
without
any
sense
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
way
they
said
they
can't
be
articulated.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
submit
to
tell
a
jury
or
a
judge,
that
rehabilitation
is
our
goal,
now
make
up
your
mind,
the
sentence
will
be
sort
of
like
saying
--
make
up
your
mind,
what
do
you
care?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
amsterdam,
would
it
help
avoid
that
where
juries
or
the
jury
sentences
at
all?
do
you
think
if
you
--
if
you
draft
to
the
set
of
standards
and
of
permitted
jury,
the
juries
to
sentence,
do
you
think
those
standards
would
really
get
you
far
along
the
line
on
--?
justice
byron
r.
white
will
you
solve
that
in
the
end
together
this
--
that
face
of
the
case,
the
only
standard
you'd
need
was
an
instruction
that
you
must
not
let
race
be
taken
into
account
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
that
all
that
would
be
necessary
to
eliminate
the
racial
part
of
this?
justice
byron
r.
white
by
the
split
verdict,
are
you
going
to
get
to
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
can
you
weigh
the
jury
trial
on
that
application
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
of
guilt?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
do
you
do
about
that,
if
there's
a
plea
of
guilty,
then
there
is
a
jury
convened,
do
you
have
to
put
on
a
prima
facie
case
of
guilty?
but
does
it
go
any
farther
in
that
case
and
does
it
move
for
a
trial,
in
terms
of
the
factors
that
goes
with
the
penalty?
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
that
--
how
do
you
view
arkansas'
theory
of
punishment
in
this
type
of
a
case?
does
the
jury
question
and
decide
the
penalty
base
on
acts
of
a
crime
only?
i
suppose
--
or
at
least
the
facts
that
come
out
in
connection
with
this
deciding
guilt
or
innocence.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
yes
but
what
is
the
--
do
you
think
that
the
jury
should
confine
itself
to
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
--
what
if
in
a
non-capital
case,
where
--
does
the
judge
ever
sentence
in
arkansas
for
certain
--
for
felonies?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
when
he
does
so,
do
you
have
the
presentence
reports?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
just
go
on
the
record
displayed
on
presenting
guilt
or
on
a
deciding
guilt
or
innocence?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
all
he
knows
is
what's
in
the
transcript.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
there
are
no
presentence
reports
or
--
in
arkansas?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
it
isn't
used
for
the
purpose
of
deciding
the
length
of
time,
where
which
the
person
is
committed
to
a
prison.
justice
byron
r.
white
was
he
killed?
justice
byron
r.
white
tell
me,
what
--
seems
your
statute,
as
i
understand,
puts
all
criminal
offenses
in
the
hands
of
the
jury
in
sentencing,
is
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
that
mean
that
there's
no
allocution
anymore
in
arkansas
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
the
situation,
where
you
say
a
non-capital
case,
if
i
understood
correctly,
the
jury
can't
agree
on
the
penalty,
perhaps
that's
true
also
in
the
capital
cases.
what
happens
then?
does
the
judge
fix
the
sentence?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
in
this
case,
if
the
jury
said
they
couldn't
agree
on
life
or
death,
the
judge
would
have
fixed
the
sentence?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
non-capital
case
you
can't.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
what
happens
in
those
situations?
is
it
under
your
statute,
does
the
defendant
have
a
right
of
allocution?
justice
byron
r.
white
your
allocution
statute
is
in
relative,
is
it
as
far
as
having
any
applications
for
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
still
on
the
books.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you've
got
a
statute,
haven't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
haven't
you
looked
up
and
i
thought
you
have?
as
you
just
told
me,
maybe
that's
wrong.
justice
byron
r.
white
oh!
that's
the
allocution.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
he
required
to
do
that
by
your
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
get
this
mr.
langston.
you
say
it's
regularly
done,
but
it's
never
done
in
the
jury,
where
the
jury
fixes.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
it's
in
the
statute,
but
judges
never
exercised
that
already
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
never
been
interpreted,
but
it
hasn't
ever
been
used
to
your
knowledge,
by
trial
judge
to
change
the
sentence
imposed
by
a
jury?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
it
has
been
done?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
the
judge
has
the
right
to
reset
the
punishment?
that
he
doesn't
agree
with
the
jury?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
seems
that
a
face
value
would
seem
to
judge
the
right
but
didn't
agree
with
the
juries'
death
sentence,
then
he
can
set
it
aside.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
is
a
great
deal
of
evidence.[laughter]
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
what
the
statute
seem
to
say
on
its
face?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then,
do
you
know
whether
a
judge
--
even
if
he
didn't
reset
the
sentence,
if
he
disagreed
with
it
he
can
order
a
new
trial,
because
he
thought
the
sentence
was
improper?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
think
he
could,
how
about
the
practice?
do
you
know
if
it's
ever
done,
that
the
judge
says
i'm
dissatisfied
with
the
sentence
and
i
would
modify
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
there's
no
--
there's
no
provision
in
arkansas
for
a
judge
giving
a
new
trial
only
on
the
penalty.
if
he
disagrees
with
the
penalty,
he'd
either
got
to
set
it
or
order
a
compete
new
trial?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i'm
waiting.
is
that
right?
you
just
told
us
under
that
statute,
if
death
was
imposed
under
that
statute,
the
judge
fix
it
at
light,
instead.
is
that
you
contend?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
doesn't
have
to
order
a
new
trial?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
doesn't
have
to
because
if
he
didn't
want
to
take
the
responsibility
himself
i
suppose
he
would
--
his
only
alternative
would
be
to
order
a
new
trial
completely
because
he
couldn't
order
death
penalt
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
any
procedure
under
your
statutes,
where
it
really
doubt
about
those
things?
this
court
could
ask
for
a
certificate
in
the
arkansas
court,
what
that
statute
mean?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
such
a
procedure
in
some
states,
others
are
barred
and
we
reserved
it
a
couple
of
times,
have
you
got
anything
like
that
in
your
state?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
if
jury
sentence
it
in
all
felony
cases?
justice
byron
r.
white
unless,
the
jury
is
waived?
justice
byron
r.
white
and,
in
non-capital
cases,
you
can
waive
the
jury?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
tried
by
the
judge,
then
judge
sentence
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
in
those
cases,
as
i
understand
you,
the
judge
sentences
only
on
the
record
that's
made
in
determining
guilty
or
innocent.
justice
byron
r.
white
he's
made
his
witness
for
that
purpose?
justice
byron
r.
white
but,
the
prosecutor
says,
“do
you
ever
engage
in
a
demonstration
against
the
vietnam
war?”
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
mr.
harris,
if
the
defendant
takes
that
stand
at
the
guilt
side
or
he
cannot,
a
cross-examination
be
asked
about
as
an
arkansas
acts
of
misconduct
of
prior
convictions,
and
that
sort
of
thing?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
he
could
be
asked
about
prior
convictions?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
he's
up
against
the
same
difficulty,
about
taking
the
stand
then
as
sort
of
--
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
but
i
mean,
he
does
--
he
is
--
has
something
with
dilemma
at
the
guilt
trial,
whether
or
not
to
take
the
stand
if
he
is
previously
been
convicted
of
the
crime,
does
he?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
the
guilt
--
that
the
penalty
phase,
the
state
can
introduce
prior
conduct,
whether
the
defendant
takes
the
stand
or
not.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
harris,
do
you
allow
judicial
sentencing
in
pleas
of
guilty?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
he
waives
the
jury?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
standards
are
provided
for
him?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
do,
i
take
it
that
if
the
judges
sentencing,
does
he
have
a
presentence
report
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
guilty
verdict,
not
in
terms
of
the
penalty,
isn't
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
there's
a
--
if
the
jury
can't
agree
on
that,
does
it
automatically
get
life
--
what
happened?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
judge
can?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
he
cannot
do
more
than
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
recent
practice
and
the
accumulation
of
this
from
experience.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
also
true,
mr.
amsterdam
in
the
non-death

what

the

what
happens
then?
does
the

so
that
in

if

said
they
couldn't
agree
on
life

death,
the

would
have
fixed

in
non-capital

you
can't.
justice
byron

white
now,
what
happens
in
those
situations?
is
it
under
your
statute,
does
the
defendant
have
a
right
of
allocution?
justice
byron
r.
white
your
allocution
statute
is
in
relative,
is
it
as
far
as
having
any
applications
for
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
still
on
the
books.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you've
got
a
statute,
haven't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
haven't
you
looked
up
and
i
thought
you
have?
as
you
just
told
me,
maybe
that's
wrong.
justice
byron
r.
white
oh!
that's
the
allocution.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
he
required
to
do
that
by
your
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
get
this
mr.
langston.
you
say
it's
regularly
done,
but
it's
never
done
in
the
jury,
where
the
jury
fixes.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
it's
in
the
statute,
but
judges
never
exercised
that
already
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
never
been
interpreted,
but
it
hasn't
ever
been
used
to
your
knowledge,
by
trial
judge
to
change
the
sentence
imposed
by
a
jury?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
it
has
been
done?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
the
judge
has
the
right
to
reset
the
punishment?
that
he
doesn't
agree
with
the
jury?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
seems
that
a
face
value
would
seem
to
judge
the
right
but
didn't
agree
with
the
juries'
death
sentence,
then
he
can
set
it
aside.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
is
a
great
deal
of
evidence.[laughter]
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
what
the
statute
seem
to
say
on
its
face?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then,
do
you
know
whether
a
judge
--
even
if
he
didn't
reset
the
sentence,
if
he
disagreed
with
it
he
can
order
a
new
trial,
because
he
thought
the
sentence
was
improper?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
think
he
could,
how
about
the
practice?
do
you
know
if
it's
ever
done,
that
the
judge
says
i'm
dissatisfied
with
the
sentence
and
i
would
modify
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
there's
no
--
there's
no
provision
in
arkansas
for
a
judge
giving
a
new
trial
only
on
the
penalty.
if
he
disagrees
with
the
penalty,
he'd
either
got
to
set
it
or
order
a
compete
new
trial?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i'm
waiting.
is
that
right?
you
just
told
us
under
that
statute,
if
death
was
imposed
under
that
statute,
the
judge
fix
it
at
light,
instead.
is
that
you
contend?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
doesn't
have
to
order
a
new
trial?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
doesn't
have
to
because
if
he
didn't
want
to
take
the
responsibility
himself
i
suppose
he
would
--
his
only
alternative
would
be
to
order
a
new
trial
completely
because
he
couldn't
order
death
penalt
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
any
procedure
under
your
statutes,
where
it
really
doubt
about
those
things?
this
court
could
ask
for
a
certificate
in
the
arkansas
court,
what
that
statute
mean?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
such
a
procedure
in
some
states,
others
are
barred
and
we
reserved
it
a
couple
of
times,
have
you
got
anything
like
that
in
your
state?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
if
jury
sentence
it
in
all
felony
cases?
justice
byron
r.
white
unless,
the
jury
is
waived?
justice
byron
r.
white
and,
in
non-capital
cases,
you
can
waive
the
jury?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
tried
by
the
judge,
then
judge
sentence
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
in
those
cases,
as
i
understand
you,
the
judge
sentences
only
on
the
record
that's
made
in
determining
guilty
or
innocent.
justice
byron
r.
white
he's
made
his
witness
for
that
purpose?
justice
byron
r.
white
but,
the
prosecutor
says,
“do
you
ever
engage
in
a
demonstration
against
the
vietnam
war?”
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
mr.
harris,
if
the
defendant
takes
that
stand
at
the
guilt
side
or
he
cannot,
a
cross-examination
be
asked
about
as
an
arkansas
acts
of
misconduct
of
prior
convictions,
and
that
sort
of
thing?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
he
could
be
asked
about
prior
convictions?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
he's
up
against
the
same
difficulty,
about
taking
the
stand
then
as
sort
of
--
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
but
i
mean,
he
does
--
he
is
--
has
something
with
dilemma
at
the
guilt
trial,
whether
or
not
to
take
the
stand
if
he
is
previously
been
convicted
of
the
crime,
does
he?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
the
guilt
--
that
the
penalty
phase,
the
state
can
introduce
prior
conduct,
whether
the
defendant
takes
the
stand
or
not.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
harris,
do
you
allow
judicial
sentencing
in
pleas
of
guilty?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
he
waives
the
jury?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
standards
are
provided
for
him?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
do,
i
take
it
that
if
the
judges
sentencing,
does
he
have
a
presentence
report
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
guilty
verdict,
not
in
terms
of
the
penalty,
isn't
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
there's
a
--
if
the
jury
can't
agree
on
that,
does
it
automatically
get
life
--
what
happened?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
judge
can?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
he
cannot
do
more
than
that?
