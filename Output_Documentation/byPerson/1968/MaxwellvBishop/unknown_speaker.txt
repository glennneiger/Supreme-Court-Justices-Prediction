unknown
speaker
are
there
any
more
standards
given
to
a
judge
if
he
does
the
sentencing
normally?
unknown
speaker
neither
one.
unknown
speaker
this
point
rests
on
your
faith
in
a
profession
rather
the
state
having
furnished
any
statement?
unknown
speaker
but
all
the
statement
--
the
states
contribution
to
it
is
furnishing
the
professionalize
i
take
it
rather
than
furnishing
the
standard?
unknown
speaker
well,
are
there
any
--
are
there
any
--
do
you
know
of
any
statutes
that
direct
the
judge
specifically
to
take
rehabilitation
into
account?
unknown
speaker
not
great
normal,
isn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
what
would
you
say
about
the
statute
mr.
amsterdam
that
is
called
the
mandatory
death
sentence?
unknown
speaker
now,
i
realize
that.
there
are
no
standards
that
i
am
trying
to
involve
there,
except
the
legislative
judgment
in
this
particular
crime
without
more
carried
in
the
legislative
point
of
view
against
them.
unknown
speaker
mr.
amsterdam,
there
is
a
rule
for
which
you
are
contending
here
confined
to
capital
cases,
now
there
are
in
some
states
or
procedures
by
which
a
non-capital
cases
juries
fix
the
penalty
and
they
have
a
range
of
discretion
as
a
constitutional
rule
for
which
you
are
here
contending
such
as
to
---
such
that
it
would
follow
that
standards
would
have
to
be
proscribed
in
such
cases.
unknown
speaker
i
want
to
be
sure
i
understand
you.
are
you
saying
that
in
your
view,
a
constitution
presents
no
barrier
to
a
state
system
under
which
for
example
the
jury
might
be
given
discretion
to
impose
a
sentence
of
one
--
in
between
one
year
and
100
years?
unknown
speaker
that’s
what
in
order
to
find
out.
i
know
this
case
doesn’t
present
quite
that
but
i
take
it
that
the
theory
that
you’re
advocating
here
might
extend
to
that
and
by
the
same
token,
i
suppose
it
would
extend
to
something
like
the
california
adult
authority
procedure,
that
is
to
say
that
at
the
same
problems
as
to
whether
that
procedure
might
be
defective
for
the
lack
of
standing.
unknown
speaker
well,
unhappily
your
last
discussion
suggest
the
possibility
that
you
might
have
two
questions.
one
the
immediate
question
or
standards
necessary
and
the
other
the
next
question,
the
next
--
when
the
next
ball
game
is
played
which
is
are
these
particular
standards
appropriate
or
adequate?
unknown
speaker
and
just
so
there
won’t
be
any
misunderstanding
again
as
far
as
i’m
concerned
with
respect
to
judge
sentencing,
are
you
saying
that
as
a
matter
of
your
understanding
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states,
it
is
not
necessary
that
the
standards
be
proscribe
to
guide
the
judge
for
the
reasons
that
you
are
so
well
stated
here
in
deciding
whether
he
will
impose
a
death
sentence
or
something
less?
unknown
speaker
would
you
say--
unknown
speaker
that’s
what
i
wanted
to
be
clear
on
now.
finally
and
this
is
my
last
question
of
you.
what
we
have
been
discussing
in
this
colloquy
would
apply
more
or
less
to
the
same
to
your
second
point
namely
the
need
for
unitary.
your
objection
to
a
unitary
trial,
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
every
act
throughout
his
life?
unknown
speaker
mr.
amsterdam,
you
stated
earlier
in
your
argument
that
in
arkansas,
as
i
suppose
in
other
states
the
statutory
offense
of
rape
covers
can
cover
a
very
wide
spectrum
actually
of
human
conduct.
as
far
as
i
can
see,
we
don’t
have
anything
of
the
facts
of
this
case.
we
don’t
have
the
trial
transcript.
we
don’t
have
any
description
what
the
actual
conduct
was
here
and
i
suppose
that
the
theory
of
arkansas
might
be
wrongly
as
that
the
jury’s
discretion
is
to
be
exercised
in
a
light
of
what
they
here
from
the
witness
stand
as
to
the
particular
circumstances
constituting
this
particular
statutory
violation
and
that
we
don’t
adhere
at
all.
i
wondered
if
it
is
available.
unknown
speaker
we
don’t
have
a
transcript
of
the
trial
of
this?
unknown
speaker
we’ll
i
suppose
that
--
unknown
speaker
well,
a
jury
hears
the
case
for
the
prosecution
on
the
issue
of
innocence
or
guilt
and
i
say
that
you
rightly
point
out
that’s
about
all
here.
and
so
i
suppose
the
theory
must
be
that
it’s
so
to
exercise
its
sentencing
discretion
based
upon
where
it’s
heard
from
the
witness
stand
with
respect
to
circumstance
of
this
statutory
violation.
unknown
speaker
well,
do
we
know
--
did
we
know
from
the
trial
record?
unknown
speaker
he
did
not
take
the
stand?
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
it’s
a
public
record
that
which
we
could
take.
unknown
speaker
and
it’s
now
lodge
so
far
as
you
know
with
the
eighth
circuit
court
of
appeals?
unknown
speaker
do
the
arkansas
practice
differ
in
many
way
from
the
practice
in
federal
courts
and
the
statutes
the
death
penalty
is
permitted?
this
apply
the
jury?
unknown
speaker
there
is
not
difference.
unknown
speaker
are
those
not
like
the
kidnapping
or
(inaudible)?
unknown
speaker
i’m
addressing
myself
to
those
jurisdictions
where
the
imposition
of
the
death
penalty
is
by
the
jury
and
the
jury
alone
where
it
has
a
choice
between
the
imposing
death
or
fixing
life.
unknown
speaker
i’m
just
wondering.
is
there
any
jurisdiction
where
the
regime
in
that
regard
is
substantially
different
from
what
it
is
in
arkansas
as
you
described?
unknown
speaker
mr.
amsterdam,
have
you
attempted
to
formulate
a
kind
of
standard
that
you
think
would
be
constitutionally
acceptable?
i
know
it’s
not
involved
in
this
case.
but
it
probably
is
the
next
step
if
you
prevail
here.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
have
to
be
legislatives.
suppose
that
it
took
the
form
of
instructions
by
the
judge.
would
that
satisfy
you
or
not?
unknown
speaker
does
it
satisfy
you
or
not?
i
beg
your
pardon,
i
mean
of
course
in
terms
of
your
or
view
of
the
constitutional
requirement.
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that
but
so
far
as
i’m
concerned
that’s
a
little
difficult
to
think
about
your
point
in
the
abstract
without
having
some
fairly
specific
idea
what
kinds
of
standards
or
what
kind
or
kinds
of
standards
the
federal
constitution
with
regard
as
within
the
limit
of
constitutional
toleration.
unknown
speaker
it
would
say
the
diffuculty
that
that
raises
i’m
sure
it’s
obvious
to
you
is
that
suppose
a
legislature
says,
“oh,
no,
no,
no
mr.
amsterdam,
that’s
not
what
we
mean.
we
mean
any
of
the
kind
of
rape.”
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
what
you’re
talking
about
is
standards
which
in
effect
redefine
the
crime.
unknown
speaker
i’m
not
talking
about
purely
what
shall
i
say
things
like
pervasives
due
process
standards
such
as
that
was
done.
it
was
done
in
the
course
of
the
commission
of
another
crime
or
even
that
get
into
the
area.
but
it
it’s
not
like
a
reasonable
man
the
example
or
pre-meditation
or
this
more
generalize
things
when
you
start
talking
about
inflict
the
death
penalty
if
the
victim
was
of
a
disparate
age.
what
you’re
really
saying
to
the
legislature
no.
you
may
not
impose
the
death
penalty
except
for
this
kind
of
rape.
unknown
speaker
the
part
of
your
submission
that
the
states
may
not
limit
considerations
encompassing
to
just
a
crime,
are
they
constitutionally
required
to
consider
the
possibilities
of
rehabilitation
or
the
character?
unknown
speaker
you
know
whether
in
arkansas
in
non-capital
cases
there
is
a
provision
for
pre-sentence
reports?
unknown
speaker
but
i
take
it
in
those
cases,
the
judge
does
sometimes
participate
in
the
sentencing?
unknown
speaker
excuse
me.
i’m
sorry.
i
was
asking
question.
what
under
arkansas
law
our
counsel
permitted
to
argue
to
the
jury
in
their
closing
argument
with
respect
to
the
imposition
of
the
death
sentence
or
not.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
if
i
may
just
add
to
one
question.
getting
back
to
your
colloquy
with
justice
white,
i
know
that
your
position
that
this
question
isn’t
here
in
this
case.
but
suppose
we
had
a
legislature
say
in
a
trial
for
the
crime
of
rape.
the
court
shall
instruct
the
jury
that
the
death
penalty
may
be
imposed
if
the
jury
is
of
the
view
that
death
is
a
punishment
that
should
be
imposed
for
the
crime
committed
by
this
defendant.
that’s
all
the
statute
says.
would
that
standard
be
unconstitutional?
unknown
speaker
because
looking
at
the
facts
as
you
referred
to.
you
referred
this
to
the
supreme
court
opinion.
i
would
suspect
that
on
these
facts
that
if
there
was
that
kind
of
instruction
required
that
the
facts
of
this
particular
crime
perhaps
would
have
brought
the
death
penalty.
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
this
one
--
this
one
dragging
her
out
of
the
house,
taking
her
two
blocks
away,
beating
her
father,
beating
her,
cutting
her
up?
unknown
speaker
those
wouldn't
be
enought
to
say
--
i
think
it's
(inaudible)
in
your
view
though.
unknown
speaker
it’s
a
great
deal
of
the
rational
mr.
amsterdam
of
the
opinion
in
the
witherspoon
case
was
based
upon
the
very
premise
that
a
jury
under
our
system,
the
system
followed
conventionally
and
most
of
the
states
is
allowed
to
roam
essentially
at
large
in
deciding
whether
or
not
to
impose
capital
punishment
and
that
therefore
it
became
awfully
important
that
the
jury
in
so
far
as
possible
would
be
--
would
represent
the
conscience
of
the
community.
that
premise
is
i
say
was
at
the
base
of
it,
largely
at
the
base
of
what
was
decided
in
the
witherspoon
case,
isn’t
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
committed?
unknown
speaker
in
a
jurisdiction
where
you
have
a
diminished
responsibility
rule,
if
the
diminished
responsibility
instruction
as
given
in
all
capital
cases,
i
don’t
know
whether
this
or
not.
but
if
that
is,
would
that
take
care
of
the
requirement
as
you
see
it?
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that
but
i
was
just
wondering
why
that
it
wouldn’t
satisfy
a
constitutional
requirement
by
a
sort
of
it’s
backwards
if
you
will.
but
the
finding
circumstances
are
much
less
than
the
death
penalty
may
be
given.
unknown
speaker
you
have
this
hypothetical
ground?
unknown
speaker
same
jury?
unknown
speaker
same
jury?
unknown
speaker
and
the
bifurcated
part
of
it
is
required
in
every
capital
case,
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
there's
no
discretion
to
say
in
this
case,
we’re
just
going
to
have
a
single
jury
--
unknown
speaker
oh,
no.
unknown
speaker
in
order
to
determine
at
the
same
time.
unknown
speaker
how
long
has
that
been
the
law?
unknown
speaker
up
to
this
time?
unknown
speaker
not
longer
than
that?
unknown
speaker
up
to
that
time
what
kind
of
trial
do
they
have?
unknown
speaker
up
to
that
time,
what
kind
of
trial
was
it?
unknown
speaker
do
you
have
unitary
trials
for
non-capital
cases?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
and
jury
sentencing
in
any
of
them
or
not?
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
there
have
been
objections
to
yours
on
the
ground
that
it
violated
the
principles
of
fundamental
fairness
until
--
what
do
you
think
about
that?
unknown
speaker
was
that
the
original
basis
of
the
jury
trial?
that
they
would
act
to
that
in
their
discretion.
unknown
speaker
members
of
the
community?
unknown
speaker
before
you
get
to
that,
may
i
ask
you
whether
at
the
end
of
the
penalty
trial,
there
are
any
instructions
given
by
the
judge
and
if
so
what
they
are?
unknown
speaker
is
that
in
your
brief
or
is
it
instruction
in
your
brief?
unknown
speaker
could
that
be
left
filed
with
this
please.
unknown
speaker
what
is
it?
unknown
speaker
what
gives
the
special
instruction
on
that
subject?
unknown
speaker
i
mean
there’s
a
substitute
or
something?
unknown
speaker
well,
it’s
because
of
that
that
i
confess
a
little
surprise
that
you
are
fairly
willing
to
accept
identification
of
your
procedure
on
this
point
with
that
of
arkansas.
the
word
standard
is
a
word
of
great
difficulty
and
i
think
that
whether
the
absence
of
standards
has
reaches
constitutional
proportion
is
a
question
that
may
appear
quite
differently
in
the
context
of
arkansas
procedure
on
the
one
hand
and
the
context
of
california’s
on
the
other
because
it’s
at
least
arguable.
i
should
think
that
under
the
california
procedure,
whether
or
not
you
say
there
are
standards,
the
jury’s
attention
in
the
second
penalty
trial
is
specifically
focused
upon
the
qualitative
judgments
that
i
suppose
or
at
least
arguably
relevant
to
the
kind
of
penalty
that
ought
to
be
imposed
whereas
in
the
arkansas
procedure
as
i
understand
it
that
this
moment
that
does
not
happen
therefore
the
two
systems
in
this
respect
are
not
necessary
properly
equated
even
before
the
application
of
constitutional
concepts.
unknown
speaker
how
did
the
courts
quit
on
that,
i
forgot?
unknown
speaker
is
it
your
understanding
that
that
is
the
same
in
arkansas
or
is
it
different?
unknown
speaker
i’m
sure
the
judge
in
arkansas
must
have
a
power
to
set
aside
a
judgment.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
under
the
old
theory
is,
you
think
it’s
so
outrageous
at
all
that
you
want
to
do
so.
i
may
be
and
i
don’t
know?
do
you
know?
unknown
speaker
the
supreme
court
can
raise
the
law
of
the
sentence?
unknown
speaker
but
they
can’t
just
decide?
unknown
speaker
there
are
six
under
the
sentence.
unknown
speaker
mr.
harris
how
was
the
jury
qualified
at
the
trial
of
this
case?
i
don’t
know
because
i
haven’t
seen
the
transcript.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
i
thought
its
--
i
thought
it
was
back
in
the
eighth
circuit.
unknown
speaker
witherspoon?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
i
guess
it’s
been
--
unknown
speaker
this
is
federal
habeas
corpus.
unknown
speaker
all
that’s
being
attacked
in
this
case
is
the
sentence
of
death,
it's
--
am
i
right
about
that?
not
the
convciton?
unknown
speaker
well,
does
the
record
show
--
unknown
speaker
well,
i
don’t
want
to
make
its
between
the
state
of
arkansas
and
the
attorney
for
mr.
maxwell
but
just
been
going
over
it,
for
example
of
it
there
was
seven
jurors
perspective
jurors
who
were
excused
on
this
ground
that
they
were
opposed
capital
punishment.
i
think
you
have
to
look
at
each
one
of
them
and
the
first
one
--
this
is
about
all
there
was
in
this
as
to
the
mr.
mccleary
the
first
man
to
be
excused.
he
was
asked
to
entertain
any
other
conscientious
scruples
about
imposing
the
death
penalty.
he
--
and
he
said,
“yes,
i
am
afraid
i
do.”
and
he
was
excused.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
what
you’re
saying
is
that
the
record
shows
in
your
judgment
an
indication
that
the
witherspoon
would
violate
--
unknown
speaker
and
that
i
believe
that
justice
douglas
wrote
an
opinion
several
years
ago
in
which
he
said,
“this
court
see
no
reason
to
send
it
back
to
go
to
a
habeas
corpus
and
then
unnecessary
habeas
corpus
when
the
record
plainly
shows
here
that
some
rules
have
been
violated.
unknown
speaker
that
transcript
was
not
--
unknown
speaker
it’s
here.
unknown
speaker
part
of
the
record.
it
was
before
the
judges
whose
judgment
we
are
--
had
happen
to
that
and
was
not
part
of
it
in
the
rule.
but
i
certainly
was
for
the
case
in
justice
douglas
rule.
we
shouldn’t
go
through
a
vain
and
useless
cert
sending
the
case
back
all
of
the
delay
that
would
occur
when
direct
of
the
matter
is
plainly
before
i
will
notice.
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
objection
by
either
side
to
having
this
transcript
before
the
court?
unknown
speaker
sustained.
unknown
speaker
i’m
sorry.
unknown
speaker
well,
how
about
the
one
before
it?
unknown
speaker
treason.
oh,
i’m
sorry.
unknown
speaker
suppose
as
i
think
mr.
justice
black
raised
in
his
colloquy
that
this
judge
thought
this
was
outrageous
or
it
shocked
his
conscience
or
something
like
that.
unknown
speaker
couldn’t
he
set
is
aside
or
sent
it
back
to
the
jury
for
reconsideration
or
something
like
that?
unknown
speaker
any
limitations
on
that?
because
it
have
to
be
four
errors
committed
in
the
trial
or
can
we
just
say
--
unknown
speaker
that
it
is
what?
unknown
speaker
what
is
--
unknown
speaker
oh,
excessive,
yes.
unknown
speaker
but
it
has
to
be
contrary
to
law.
but
what
law
is
it
contrary
to
if
it’s
just
shocks
the
conscience
or
to
use
mr.
justice
black’s
word,
outrageous?
unknown
speaker
is
that
--
but
that’s
not
--
is
that
acknowledged
in
any
statute
or
any
of
decided
case?
or
is
that
just
something
that
judges
do
when
there’s
conscience
of
shock
or
it’s
outrageous?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
do
you
know
of
any
instance
in
which
that
power
has
been
exercised?
unknown
speaker
in
whose
eyes?
unknown
speaker
against
the
charge
of
perjury?
he
lives
with
his
answer
plus
a
charge
of
perjury.
unknown
speaker
forgive
me
for
this
--
raising
this,
this
may
not
be
directly
irrelevant,
but
i
always
have
difficulty
when
counsel
referred
to
a
jury
as
reflecting
the
conscience
of
the
community.
now
particularly
in
this
penalty
matters,
it
might
very
well
be
that
if
he
took
a
vote
in
the
community,
the
prevailing
settlement
would
be
to
lynch
him
or
hang
him
or
electrocute
her
or
the
lord
knows
what.
but
that
--
the
material
that
is
there
before
the
jury
might
indicate
a
reasonable
man
who
is
a
human
being
that
some
other
consequence
ought
to
be
attached
and
one
of
the
fundamental
perhaps
it’s
philosophical
are
rather
than
strictly
legal,
one
of
the
fundamental
questions
that
all
of
this
raises
is
what
the
jurors
suppose
to
do.
and
i
had
thought
the
juror
was
suppose
to
bring
the
bear
upon
the
material
before
him
as
comprehended
by
his
senses,
his
qualities
as
a
human
being
subject
to
the
law
and
the
standards
if
and
if
that
were
given
to
him
rather
than
to
reflect
what
might
be
a
community
attitude
towards
rape
or
murder
or
this
particular
fellow.
unknown
speaker
no,
that’s
--
their
conscience
they
bring
not
--
but
not
the
conscience
necessarily
the
conscience
in
the
sense
of
a
growth
of
their
reaction
grossly
of
the
people
at
large
who
don’t
have
before
them
what
the
juror
is
suppose
to
have
before
him
and
that
is
as
i
was
trying
to
suggest
perhaps
not
very
articulately
related
to
the
question
that
is
being
argued
here
namely
the
question
as
to
whether
in
bringing
to
bear
his
own
conscience,
his
own
qualities
as
a
human
being,
his
own
comprehension
upon
the
material
before
him
if
that’s
the
jurors
function
rather
than
just
to
reflect
the
gross
reaction
of
the
community.
the
juror
must
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
principle
have
the
guidance
of
some
standards
in
at
least
a
philosophical
sense
that
may
be
may
light
perhaps
at
the
close
to
the
heart
of
the
issue
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
how
many
capital
crimes
were
there?
unknown
speaker
what
year
was
that?
unknown
speaker
was
that
done
by
parliament
or
with
the
court?
unknown
speaker
with
the
court?
unknown
speaker
by
the
courts
below
are
you
saying?
they
don't
--
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
you
contemplated
the
possibility
that
a
proscription
of
standards
may
result
in
more
and
not
fewer
death
penalties.
have
you
got
a
reaction
on
that,
mr.
amsterdam?
unknown
speaker
i’m
not
--
that’s
not
what
i
have
in
mind.
but
necessarily,
there
is
a
possibility
in
a
way
and
the
man
may
reasonably
differ
as
to
how
important
it
is
that
proscribing
standards
for
the
imposition
of
the
death
penalty
may
result
in
more
death
penalties
and
would
come
about
if
the
juries
were
just
left
free
and
do
what
they
choose.
and
i
assume
you
have
considered
that
and
that
you've
concluded
that
it’s
not
really
relevant
to
legal
argument
that
you
make.
unknown
speaker
excuse
mr.
harris,
i
didn't
understand.
you
say
20
was
the
number
of
jury
imposed?
unknown
speaker
who
imposed
the
rest
of
them,
of
the
80
to
90?
unknown
speaker
oh!
in
a
single
year?
unknown
speaker
oh!
i
see,
yes.
unknown
speaker
are
there
any
more
standards
given
to
a
judge
if
he
does
the
sentencing
normally?
unknown
speaker
neither
one.
unknown
speaker
this
point
rests
on
your
faith
in
a
profession
rather
the
state
having
furnished
any
statement?
unknown
speaker
but
all
the
statement
--
the
states
contribution
to
it
is
furnishing
the
professionalize
i
take
it
rather
than
furnishing
the
standard?
unknown
speaker
well,
are
there
any
--
are
there
any
--
do
you
know
of
any
statutes
that
direct
the
judge
specifically
to
take
rehabilitation
into
account?
unknown
speaker
not
great
normal,
isn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
what
would
you
say
about
the
statute
mr.
amsterdam
that
is
called
the
mandatory
death
sentence?
unknown
speaker
now,
i
realize
that.
there
are
no
standards
that
i
am
trying
to
involve
there,
except
the
legislative
judgment
in
this
particular
crime
without
more
carried
in
the
legislative
point
of
view
against
them.
unknown
speaker
mr.
amsterdam,
there
is
a
rule
for
which
you
are
contending
here
confined
to
capital
cases,
now
there
are
in
some
states
or
procedures
by
which
a
non-capital
cases
juries
fix
the
penalty
and
they
have
a
range
of
discretion
as
a
constitutional
rule
for
which
you
are
here
contending
such
as
to
---
such
that
it
would
follow
that
standards
would
have
to
be
proscribed
in
such
cases.
unknown
speaker
i
want
to
be
sure
i
understand
you.
are
you
saying
that
in
your
view,
a
constitution
presents
no
barrier
to
a
state
system
under
which
for
example
the
jury
might
be
given
discretion
to
impose
a
sentence
of
one
--
in
between
one
year
and
100
years?
unknown
speaker
that’s
what
in
order
to
find
out.
i
know
this
case
doesn’t
present
quite
that
but
i
take
it
that
the
theory
that
you’re
advocating
here
might
extend
to
that
and
by
the
same
token,
i
suppose
it
would
extend
to
something
like
the
california
adult
authority
procedure,
that
is
to
say
that
at
the
same
problems
as
to
whether
that
procedure
might
be
defective
for
the
lack
of
standing.
unknown
speaker
well,
unhappily
your
last
discussion
suggest
the
possibility
that
you
might
have
two
questions.
one
the
immediate
question
or
standards
necessary
and
the
other
the
next
question,
the
next
--
when
the
next
ball
game
is
played
which
is
are
these
particular
standards
appropriate
or
adequate?
unknown
speaker
and
just
so
there
won’t
be
any
misunderstanding
again
as
far
as
i’m
concerned
with
respect
to
judge
sentencing,
are
you
saying
that
as
a
matter
of
your
understanding
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states,
it
is
not
necessary
that
the
standards
be
proscribe
to
guide
the
judge
for
the
reasons
that
you
are
so
well
stated
here
in
deciding
whether
he
will
impose
a
death
sentence
or
something
less?
unknown
speaker
would
you
say--
unknown
speaker
that’s
what
i
wanted
to
be
clear
on
now.
finally
and
this
is
my
last
question
of
you.
what
we
have
been
discussing
in
this
colloquy
would
apply
more
or
less
to
the
same
to
your
second
point
namely
the
need
for
unitary.
your
objection
to
a
unitary
trial,
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
every
act
throughout
his
life?
unknown
speaker
mr.
amsterdam,
you
stated
earlier
in
your
argument
that
in
arkansas,
as
i
suppose
in
other
states
the
statutory
offense
of
rape
covers
can
cover
a
very
wide
spectrum
actually
of
human
conduct.
as
far
as
i
can
see,
we
don’t
have
anything
of
the
facts
of
this
case.
we
don’t
have
the
trial
transcript.
we
don’t
have
any
description
what
the
actual
conduct
was
here
and
i
suppose
that
the
theory
of
arkansas
might
be
wrongly
as
that
the
jury’s
discretion
is
to
be
exercised
in
a
light
of
what
they
here
from
the
witness
stand
as
to
the
particular
circumstances
constituting
this
particular
statutory
violation
and
that
we
don’t
adhere
at
all.
i
wondered
if
it
is
available.
unknown
speaker
we
don’t
have
a
transcript
of
the
trial
of
this?
unknown
speaker
we’ll
i
suppose
that
--
unknown
speaker
well,
a
jury
hears
the
case
for
the
prosecution
on
the
issue
of
innocence
or
guilt
and
i
say
that
you
rightly
point
out
that’s
about
all
here.
and
so
i
suppose
the
theory
must
be
that
it’s
so
to
exercise
its
sentencing
discretion
based
upon
where
it’s
heard
from
the
witness
stand
with
respect
to
circumstance
of
this
statutory
violation.
unknown
speaker
well,
do
we
know
--
did
we
know
from
the
trial
record?
unknown
speaker
he
did
not
take
the
stand?
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
it’s
a
public
record
that
which
we
could
take.
unknown
speaker
and
it’s
now
lodge
so
far
as
you
know
with
the
eighth
circuit
court
of
appeals?
unknown
speaker
do
the
arkansas
practice
differ
in
many
way
from
the
practice
in
federal
courts
and
the
statutes
the
death
penalty
is
permitted?
this
apply
the
jury?
unknown
speaker
there
is
not
difference.
unknown
speaker
are
those
not
like
the
kidnapping
or
(inaudible)?
unknown
speaker
i’m
addressing
myself
to
those
jurisdictions
where
the
imposition
of
the
death
penalty
is
by
the
jury
and
the
jury
alone
where
it
has
a
choice
between
the
imposing
death
or
fixing
life.
unknown
speaker
i’m
just
wondering.
is
there
any
jurisdiction
where
the
regime
in
that
regard
is
substantially
different
from
what
it
is
in
arkansas
as
you
described?
unknown
speaker
mr.
amsterdam,
have
you
attempted
to
formulate
a
kind
of
standard
that
you
think
would
be
constitutionally
acceptable?
i
know
it’s
not
involved
in
this
case.
but
it
probably
is
the
next
step
if
you
prevail
here.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
have
to
be
legislatives.
suppose
that
it
took
the
form
of
instructions
by
the
judge.
would
that
satisfy
you
or
not?
unknown
speaker
does
it
satisfy
you
or
not?
i
beg
your
pardon,
i
mean
of
course
in
terms
of
your
or
view
of
the
constitutional
requirement.
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that
but
so
far
as
i’m
concerned
that’s
a
little
difficult
to
think
about
your
point
in
the
abstract
without
having
some
fairly
specific
idea
what
kinds
of
standards
or
what
kind
or
kinds
of
standards
the
federal
constitution
with
regard
as
within
the
limit
of
constitutional
toleration.
unknown
speaker
it
would
say
the
diffuculty
that
that
raises
i’m
sure
it’s
obvious
to
you
is
that
suppose
a
legislature
says,
“oh,
no,
no,
no
mr.
amsterdam,
that’s
not
what
we
mean.
we
mean
any
of
the
kind
of
rape.”
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
what
you’re
talking
about
is
standards
which
in
effect
redefine
the
crime.
unknown
speaker
i’m
not
talking
about
purely
what
shall
i
say
things
like
pervasives
due
process
standards
such
as
that
was
done.
it
was
done
in
the
course
of
the
commission
of
another
crime
or
even
that
get
into
the
area.
but
it
it’s
not
like
a
reasonable
man
the
example
or
pre-meditation
or
this
more
generalize
things
when
you
start
talking
about
inflict
the
death
penalty
if
the
victim
was
of
a
disparate
age.
what
you’re
really
saying
to
the
legislature
no.
you
may
not
impose
the
death
penalty
except
for
this
kind
of
rape.
unknown
speaker
the
part
of
your
submission
that
the
states
may
not
limit
considerations
encompassing
to
just
a
crime,
are
they
constitutionally
required
to
consider
the
possibilities
of
rehabilitation
or
the
character?
unknown
speaker
you
know
whether
in
arkansas
in
non-capital
cases
there
is
a
provision
for
pre-sentence
reports?
unknown
speaker
but
i
take
it
in
those
cases,
the
judge
does
sometimes
participate
in
the
sentencing?
unknown
speaker
excuse
me.
i’m
sorry.
i
was
asking
question.
what
under
arkansas
law
our
counsel
permitted
to
argue
to
the
jury
in
their
closing
argument
with
respect
to
the
imposition
of
the
death
sentence
or
not.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
if
i
may
just
add
to
one
question.
getting
back
to
your
colloquy
with
justice
white,
i
know
that
your
position
that
this
question
isn’t
here
in
this
case.
but
suppose
we
had
a
legislature
say
in
a
trial
for
the
crime
of
rape.
the
court
shall
instruct
the
jury
that
the
death
penalty
may
be
imposed
if
the
jury
is
of
the
view
that
death
is
a
punishment
that
should
be
imposed
for
the
crime
committed
by
this
defendant.
that’s
all
the
statute
says.
would
that
standard
be
unconstitutional?
unknown
speaker
because
looking
at
the
facts
as
you
referred
to.
you
referred
this
to
the
supreme
court
opinion.
i
would
suspect
that
on
these
facts
that
if
there
was
that
kind
of
instruction
required
that
the
facts
of
this
particular
crime
perhaps
would
have
brought
the
death
penalty.
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
this
one
--
this
one
dragging
her
out
of
the
house,
taking
her
two
blocks
away,
beating
her
father,
beating
her,
cutting
her
up?
unknown
speaker
those
wouldn't
be
enought
to
say
--
i
think
it's
(inaudible)
in
your
view
though.
unknown
speaker
it’s
a
great
deal
of
the
rational
mr.
amsterdam
of
the
opinion
in
the
witherspoon
case
was
based
upon
the
very
premise
that
a
jury
under
our
system,
the
system
followed
conventionally
and
most
of
the
states
is
allowed
to
roam
essentially
at
large
in
deciding
whether
or
not
to
impose
capital
punishment
and
that
therefore
it
became
awfully
important
that
the
jury
in
so
far
as
possible
would
be
--
would
represent
the
conscience
of
the
community.
that
premise
is
i
say
was
at
the
base
of
it,
largely
at
the
base
of
what
was
decided
in
the
witherspoon
case,
isn’t
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
committed?
unknown
speaker
in
a
jurisdiction
where
you
have
a
diminished
responsibility
rule,
if
the
diminished
responsibility
instruction
as
given
in
all
capital
cases,
i
don’t
know
whether
this
or
not.
but
if
that
is,
would
that
take
care
of
the
requirement
as
you
see
it?
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that
but
i
was
just
wondering
why
that
it
wouldn’t
satisfy
a
constitutional
requirement
by
a
sort
of
it’s
backwards
if
you
will.
but
the
finding
circumstances
are
much
less
than
the
death
penalty
may
be
given.
unknown
speaker
you
have
this
hypothetical
ground?
unknown
speaker
same
jury?
unknown
speaker
same
jury?
unknown
speaker
and
the
bifurcated
part
of
it
is
required
in
every
capital
case,
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
there's
no
discretion
to
say
in
this
case,
we’re
just
going
to
have
a
single
jury
--
unknown
speaker
oh,
no.
unknown
speaker
in
order
to
determine
at
the
same
time.
unknown
speaker
how
long
has
that
been
the
law?
unknown
speaker
up
to
this
time?
unknown
speaker
not
longer
than
that?
unknown
speaker
up
to
that
time
what
kind
of
trial
do
they
have?
unknown
speaker
up
to
that
time,
what
kind
of
trial
was
it?
unknown
speaker
do
you
have
unitary
trials
for
non-capital
cases?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
and
jury
sentencing
in
any
of
them
or
not?
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
there
have
been
objections
to
yours
on
the
ground
that
it
violated
the
principles
of
fundamental
fairness
until
--
what
do
you
think
about
that?
unknown
speaker
was
that
the
original
basis
of
the
jury
trial?
that
they
would
act
to
that
in
their
discretion.
unknown
speaker
members
of
the
community?
unknown
speaker
before
you
get
to
that,
may
i
ask
you
whether
at
the
end
of
the
penalty
trial,
there
are
any
instructions
given
by
the
judge
and
if
so
what
they
are?
unknown
speaker
is
that
in
your
brief
or
is
it
instruction
in
your
brief?
unknown
speaker
could
that
be
left
filed
with
this
please.
unknown
speaker
what
is
it?
unknown
speaker
what
gives
the
special
instruction
on
that
subject?
unknown
speaker
i
mean
there’s
a
substitute
or
something?
unknown
speaker
well,
it’s
because
of
that
that
i
confess
a
little
surprise
that
you
are
fairly
willing
to
accept
identification
of
your
procedure
on
this
point
with
that
of
arkansas.
the
word
standard
is
a
word
of
great
difficulty
and
i
think
that
whether
the
absence
of
standards
has
reaches
constitutional
proportion
is
a
question
that
may
appear
quite
differently
in
the
context
of
arkansas
procedure
on
the
one
hand
and
the
context
of
california’s
on
the
other
because
it’s
at
least
arguable.
i
should
think
that
under
the
california
procedure,
whether
or
not
you
say
there
are
standards,
the
jury’s
attention
in
the
second
penalty
trial
is
specifically
focused
upon
the
qualitative
judgments
that
i
suppose
or
at
least
arguably
relevant
to
the
kind
of
penalty
that
ought
to
be
imposed
whereas
in
the
arkansas
procedure
as
i
understand
it
that
this
moment
that
does
not
happen
therefore
the
two
systems
in
this
respect
are
not
necessary
properly
equated
even
before
the
application
of
constitutional
concepts.
unknown
speaker
how
did
the
courts
quit
on
that,
i
forgot?
unknown
speaker
is
it
your
understanding
that
that
is
the
same
in
arkansas
or
is
it
different?
unknown
speaker
i’m
sure
the
judge
in
arkansas
must
have
a
power
to
set
aside
a
judgment.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
under
the
old
theory
is,
you
think
it’s
so
outrageous
at
all
that
you
want
to
do
so.
i
may
be
and
i
don’t
know?
do
you
know?
unknown
speaker
the
supreme
court
can
raise
the
law
of
the
sentence?
unknown
speaker
but
they
can’t
just
decide?
unknown
speaker
there
are
six
under
the
sentence.
unknown
speaker
mr.
harris
how
was
the
jury
qualified
at
the
trial
of
this
case?
i
don’t
know
because
i
haven’t
seen
the
transcript.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
i
thought
its
--
i
thought
it
was
back
in
the
eighth
circuit.
unknown
speaker
witherspoon?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
i
guess
it’s
been
--
unknown
speaker
this
is
federal
habeas
corpus.
unknown
speaker
all
that’s
being
attacked
in
this
case
is
the
sentence
of
death,
it's
--
am
i
right
about
that?
not
the
convciton?
unknown
speaker
well,
does
the
record
show
--
unknown
speaker
well,
i
don’t
want
to
make
its
between
the
state
of
arkansas
and
the
attorney
for
mr.
maxwell
but
just
been
going
over
it,
for
example
of
it
there
was
seven
jurors
perspective
jurors
who
were
excused
on
this
ground
that
they
were
opposed
capital
punishment.
i
think
you
have
to
look
at
each
one
of
them
and
the
first
one
--
this
is
about
all
there
was
in
this
as
to
the
mr.
mccleary
the
first
man
to
be
excused.
he
was
asked
to
entertain
any
other
conscientious
scruples
about
imposing
the
death
penalty.
he
--
and
he
said,
“yes,
i
am
afraid
i
do.”
and
he
was
excused.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
what
you’re
saying
is
that
the
record
shows
in
your
judgment
an
indication
that
the
witherspoon
would
violate
--
unknown
speaker
and
that
i
believe
that
justice
douglas
wrote
an
opinion
several
years
ago
in
which
he
said,
“this
court
see
no
reason
to
send
it
back
to
go
to
a
habeas
corpus
and
then
unnecessary
habeas
corpus
when
the
record
plainly
shows
here
that
some
rules
have
been
violated.
unknown
speaker
that
transcript
was
not
--
unknown
speaker
it’s
here.
unknown
speaker
part
of
the
record.
it
was
before
the
judges
whose
judgment
we
are
--
had
happen
to
that
and
was
not
part
of
it
in
the
rule.
but
i
certainly
was
for
the
case
in
justice
douglas
rule.
we
shouldn’t
go
through
a
vain
and
useless
cert
sending
the
case
back
all
of
the
delay
that
would
occur
when
direct
of
the
matter
is
plainly
before
i
will
notice.
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
objection
by
either
side
to
having
this
transcript
before
the
court?
unknown
speaker
sustained.
unknown
speaker
i’m
sorry.
unknown
speaker
well,
how
about
the
one
before
it?
unknown
speaker
treason.
oh,
i’m
sorry.
unknown
speaker
suppose
as
i
think
mr.
justice
black
raised
in
his
colloquy
that
this
judge
thought
this
was
outrageous
or
it
shocked
his
conscience
or
something
like
that.
unknown
speaker
couldn’t
he
set
is
aside
or
sent
it
back
to
the
jury
for
reconsideration
or
something
like
that?
unknown
speaker
any
limitations
on
that?
because
it
have
to
be
four
errors
committed
in
the
trial
or
can
we
just
say
--
unknown
speaker
that
it
is
what?
unknown
speaker
what
is
--
unknown
speaker
oh,
excessive,
yes.
unknown
speaker
but
it
has
to
be
contrary
to
law.
but
what
law
is
it
contrary
to
if
it’s
just
shocks
the
conscience
or
to
use
mr.
justice
black’s
word,
outrageous?
unknown
speaker
is
that
--
but
that’s
not
--
is
that
acknowledged
in
any
statute
or
any
of
decided
case?
or
is
that
just
something
that
judges
do
when
there’s
conscience
of
shock
or
it’s
outrageous?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
do
you
know
of
any
instance
in
which
that
power
has
been
exercised?
unknown
speaker
in
whose
eyes?
unknown
speaker
against
the
charge
of
perjury?
he
lives
with
his
answer
plus
a
charge
of
perjury.
unknown
speaker
forgive
me
for
this
--
raising
this,
this
may
not
be
directly
irrelevant,
but
i
always
have
difficulty
when
counsel
referred
to
a
jury
as
reflecting
the
conscience
of
the
community.
now
particularly
in
this
penalty
matters,
it
might
very
well
be
that
if
he
took
a
vote
in
the
community,
the
prevailing
settlement
would
be
to
lynch
him
or
hang
him
or
electrocute
her
or
the
lord
knows
what.
but
that
--
the
material
that
is
there
before
the
jury
might
indicate
a
reasonable
man
who
is
a
human
being
that
some
other
consequence
ought
to
be
attached
and
one
of
the
fundamental
perhaps
it’s
philosophical
are
rather
than
strictly
legal,
one
of
the
fundamental
questions
that
all
of
this
raises
is
what
the
jurors
suppose
to
do.
and
i
had
thought
the
juror
was
suppose
to
bring
the
bear
upon
the
material
before
him
as
comprehended
by
his
senses,
his
qualities
as
a
human
being
subject
to
the
law
and
the
standards
if
and
if
that
were
given
to
him
rather
than
to
reflect
what
might
be
a
community
attitude
towards
rape
or
murder
or
this
particular
fellow.
unknown
speaker
no,
that’s
--
their
conscience
they
bring
not
--
but
not
the
conscience
necessarily
the
conscience
in
the
sense
of
a
growth
of
their
reaction
grossly
of
the
people
at
large
who
don’t
have
before
them
what
the
juror
is
suppose
to
have
before
him
and
that
is
as
i
was
trying
to
suggest
perhaps
not
very
articulately
related
to
the
question
that
is
being
argued
here
namely
the
question
as
to
whether
in
bringing
to
bear
his
own
conscience,
his
own
qualities
as
a
human
being,
his
own
comprehension
upon
the
material
before
him
if
that’s
the
jurors
function
rather
than
just
to
reflect
the
gross
reaction
of
the
community.
the
juror
must
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
principle
have
the
guidance
of
some
standards
in
at
least
a
philosophical
sense
that
may
be
may
light
perhaps
at
the
close
to
the
heart
of
the
issue
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
how
many
capital
crimes
were
there?
unknown
speaker
what
year
was
that?
unknown
speaker
was
that
done
by
parliament
or
with
the
court?
unknown
speaker
with
the
court?
unknown
speaker
by
the
courts
below
are
you
saying?
they
don't
--
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
you
contemplated
the
possibility
that
a
proscription
of
standards
may
result
in
more
and
not
fewer
death
penalties.
have
you
got
a
reaction
on
that,
mr.
amsterdam?
unknown
speaker
i’m
not
--
that’s
not
what
i
have
in
mind.
but
necessarily,
there
is
a
possibility
in
a
way
and
the
man
may
reasonably
differ
as
to
how
important
it
is
that
proscribing
standards
for
the
imposition
of
the
death
penalty
may
result
in
more
death
penalties
and
would
come
about
if
the
juries
were
just
left
free
and
do
what
they
choose.
and
i
assume
you
have
considered
that
and
that
you've
concluded
that
it’s
not
really
relevant
to
legal
argument
that
you
make.
unknown
speaker
excuse
mr.
harris,
i
didn't
understand.
you
say
20
was
the
number
of
jury
imposed?
unknown
speaker
who
imposed
the
rest
of
them,
of
the
80
to
90?
unknown
speaker
oh!
in
a
single
year?
unknown
speaker
oh!
i
see,
yes.
