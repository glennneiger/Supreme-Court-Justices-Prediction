justice
byron
r.
white
what
would
they
have
left?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
those
ones
who
notified
that
they
didn't
want
to
be
part
of
the
action?
what
would
they
have
retained
by
that
action?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
they
were
--
so
there
would
be
at
least
two
actions
in
that
possible.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
a
hundred
shareholder,
each
said
“i
want
to
stay
out”,
there
would
be
--
all
of
those
hundred
could
bring
their
own
separate
action?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
state
their
own
cause
of
action.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
if
--
what
if
two
of
those
hundred
joined
in
one
suit?
two
named
--
two
parties,
two
of
his
class,
two
of
the
hundred
who
said
we
don't
want
to
be
part
of
this
case,
then
brought
in
their
own
name
--
justice
byron
r.
white
their
own
actions
against
the
company
each
for
2,000
--
each
for
$5,000.00.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
could
they
do
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes
but
as
between
them
they
do,
but
you
say
that
--
you
say
the
two
stockholders
may
aggregate
if
they
bring
--
if
two
stockholders
joined
in
one
action
against
the
company?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
this
isn't
a
class
action.
they
don't
report
to
be
bringing
a
class
action
for
anybody.
they
just
say
we
are
bringing
our
own
causes
of
action,
the
two
of
us,
right
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that,
how
--
what
makes
you
say
that
can
aggregate
in
that
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
right,
exactly.
justice
byron
r.
white
which
means
that
they
couldn't
aggregate?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
they
wouldn't
--
they
couldn't
bring
their
action
in
the
federal
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that,
i
understand
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
simple
joinder
case,
no
aggregation.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
in
that,
there's
a
case
i
brought
you,
i
gave
to
you,
you
said
there
would
be
no
aggregation
but
nevertheless
both
parties
would
be
bound
by
the
judgment.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
nevertheless
when
the
lawsuit
was
over,
both
parties
would
be
bound.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
furthermore,
the
issues
of
that
fact
and
law
are
identical.
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
your
view
with
the
case
where
a
single
stockholder
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
you
would
say
that
in
an
action
by
stockholders
in
cases
where
they
have
similar
claims
that
three
stockholders
sued
the
same
defendant
and
they
all
were
named
plaintiffs
that
each
would
have
to
have
the
necessary
jurisdictional
amount.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you,
do
you
think
in
permissive
joinder
cases
where
each
one
has
a
distinct
claims
a
three
parties
are
permitted
to
join
one
action
suing
the
same
defendant
and
that
each
must
have
the
jurisdictional
amount.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
suggestion
is
here
that
if
--
that
--
i
think
your
claim
is
that
the
other
side
suggest
that
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
drop
out
the
other
two
names
and
sue
as
a
class.
justice
byron
r.
white
to
avoid
the
same
result?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
if
they
are
bound
to
the
judgment?
justice
byron
r.
white
maybe
some
reasons
why
you
think
that
should
be
termed,
but
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
if
your
gas
users
bring
an
action
by
himself?
these
are
gas
users
here,
aren't
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
could
just
one
of
the
members
of
this
group
bring
his
own
action
if
he
wanted
to?
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
that
--
let's
assume
that
two
or
three
of
them
together
brought
their
own
action
naming
each
other
as
a
party
in
the
federal
court
and
the
three
of
them
together
added
up
to
$10,000.00.
they
didn't
report
to
bring
a
class
action,
there
are
just
three
of
us
are
suing
permissive
joinder
case.
i
suppose
its
permissive
joinder?
justice
byron
r.
white
there's
no
aggregation
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
this
is
--
this
is
because
of
a
statute
that
requires
$10,000.00.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
say,
well,
yes.
but
we
can
add
up
together
the
$10,000.00.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
think
that
one
of
the
men
could
say
“well,
let's
just
--
two
of
you
get
out
and
all
bring
a
class
action.”
justice
byron
r.
white
we're
just
going
to
state
this
--
our
cause
under
rule
23.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
there
were
only
three
members
of
the
class,
there
are
only
three
members
of
the
class
that
you
--
the
three
could
still
stay
and
just
say
we
are
suing
as
a
class
action?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
just
by
putting
the
rule
23
label
on
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
in
any
event,
the
three
of
them
could
in
your
case
you
think
where
there
are
lots
of
gas
users
unidentifiable
to
raise
in,
they
could
bring
a
class
action?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
they
could
stay
in
the
federal
court
themselves
if
they
just
name
themselves
as
plaintiffs?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
the
three
--
if
the
three
people
we
are
talking
about
awhile
ago
have
individual
claims
when
they
name
themselves
as
plaintiffs.
i
suppose
they
still
have
individual
claims
when
they
name
themselves
as
plaintiffs
but
also
purport
to
be
bringing
in
class
action
and
why
isn't
--
why
aren't
the
--
and
if
their
claims
were
individual
claims,
why
aren't
the
claims
of
all
of
the
unnamed
members
of
the
class
also
individual
claims?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
are
individual
claims
but
because
of
rule
23,
you
say
that
they
--
they
can
aggregate.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
knows
--
justice
byron
r.
white
then
the
three
--
justice
byron
r.
white
then
the
three
named
plaintiffs
claim
--
their
claims
also
become
a
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
non-individual
claim.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
they
can
get
out
themselves,
they
can't
dismiss
the
case
on
behalf
of
other
people
take
it
out
themselves.
justice
byron
r.
white
he
doesn't
have
to
dismiss
the
lawsuit.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
so
if
the
three
people
be
bound
if
they
just
sued
for
themselves?
justice
byron
r.
white
all
three
of
them
would
be
bound
by
a
judgment
justice
byron
r.
white
they
just
sued
on
their
own
behalf
and
yet
you
say
no
aggregation.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
right.
that's
right,
but
when
you
do
report
to
bring
in
the
unnamed
parties,
do
report
to
bring
what
you
call
a
class
action.
you
say
that
because
they
are
bound,
therefore
it's
one
claim
and
therefore
there
is
in
effect
aggregation.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
--
i'm
just
not
sure
that
necessary
follows
from
the
fact
from
the
consequence
of
binding
that
there
is
aggregation.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
certainly
rule
23
in
the
long
run
has
to
be
in
effect
be
consistent
with
the
statutory
limit
of
$10,000.00.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
yet
the
$10,000.00
limitation
is
then
the
amount
has
been
changed
but
the
requirement
of
that
amount
against
the
background
of
these
older
cases
have
been
reenacted
time
and
again.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
would
they
have
left?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
those
ones
who
notified
that
they
didn't
want
to
be
part
of
the
action?
what
would
they
have
retained
by
that
action?
justice
byron

so
they
were
--
so
there
would
be
at

two
actions
in

their

actions
against
the
company
each
for
2,000

each
for
$5,000.00.
justice
byron

how
could
they
do
that?
justice

yes

as
between

they

you

that

they
just

right

i
