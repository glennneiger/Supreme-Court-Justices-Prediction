mr.
robert
martin
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
we
have
two
platforms
from
which
to
look
at
the
question
before
the
court.
the
first
one
being
the
proper
effect
and
interpretation
of
amended
rule
23
and
the
second
one
being
whether
there
is
any
substance
to
the
argument
here
that
the
effect
of
the
amended
rule
is
to
extend
the
jurisdiction
of
federal
courts
unlawfully.
now,
most
of
the
questions
that
if
occurred
or
that
had
been
asked
from
the
bench
in
the
preceding
case
and
in
this
case
really
concerned
the
first
question,
the
proper
interpretation
and
application
and
practical
effect
of
rule
23
on
class
litigation.
so,
i
want
to
address
myself
to
that
aspect
of
what
we
have
before
us
first.
i'm
embarrassed
to
say
that
i
have
a
somewhat
different
view
of
amended
rule
23
than
seems
to
be
the
view
by
any
of
the
three
preceding
counsel.
i
see
rule
23
as
it's
now
amended
as
an
attempt
to
straighten
out
and
do
away
with
some
terrible
problems
that
confronted
us
in
the
practical
application
of
former
rule
23
and
very
briefly
what
i
am
referring
to
is
this.
former
rule
23
did
have
its
origin
as
one
of
the
counsel
stated
in
the
old
equity
rules
but
when
rule
23
was
promulgated,
it
appears
from
the
history
that
professor
moore
undertook
to
categorize
the
circumstances
under
which
you
could
have
a
class
action
and
he
came
up
with
a
three
categories
which
were
not
resided
in
the
rule
by
name
but
were
described
really
in
subdivisions
(a)
(1),
(2)
and
(3)
of
true
hybrid
and
spurious.
now
he
thought
and
i
think
the
bar
thought
and
you
can
find
in
the
literature
statements
by
writers
to
the
effect
that
this
was
a
clear
rule
and
plain
english
and
everybody
could
understand
it.
i
think
everyone
thought
that
those
categories
are
going
to
work
well
and
they
do
work
well
when
you're
talking
about
property
rights
and
they
had
some
historical
basis.
if
you
were
bringing
a
--
if
two
people
were
joined
together
to
--
as
plaintiffs
to
try
title
to
quarter
section
of
land,
what
any
problem
to
understand
that
they
could
aggregate
their
claims,
they
were
all
going
to
be
bound
by
the
judgment,
you
really
had
one
piece
of
litigation.
and
we
have
what
we
call
in
rem
jurisdiction
and
all
these
things
were
familiar
to
lawyers
and
they
understood
them.
mr.
robert
martin
yes,
sir.
and
it
was
really
aggregation
of
plaintiffs
and
not
aggregation
of
claims
at
all.
now,
professor
moore
attempted
to
apply
that
the
class
actions
and
i
think
the
history
demonstrates
that
it
works
well
when
you're
dealing
with
property
or
a
fund
but
class
actions
very
quickly
became
broader
than
that.
there
were
all
kinds
of
rights
and
all
kinds
of
situations
developed
chiefly
by
modern
commerce
that
demanded,
cried
out
for
adjudication
by
class
action.
and
it
isn't
a
question
of
increasing
case,
load
as
a
question
of
decreasing
and
when
we
try
to
extend
these
categories
beyond
property
rights,
we
got
into
trouble
and
we
got
in
to
bad
trouble.
rule
23
left
cases
spread
over
our
reports
that
simply
couldn't
be
rationalized
or
harmonized
in
certain
areas,
one
of
them
being
the
question
of
jurisdiction
that
we
have
before
us
both
as
to
amount
and
as
to
diversity.
now,
there
was
no
problem
about
aggregation
when
you
talked
about
a
claim
to
try
title
where
you
have
more
than
one
party
but
when
you
got
down
to
what
professor
moore
termed
and
the
committee
termed
a
spurious
class
action.
you
have
the
literature
which
said
this
really
isn't
a
class
action
at
all.
this
is
a
permissive
joinder
device.
well
then,
you
were
face
to
face
with
this
problem
not
only
as
to
jurisdictional
amount
but
as
to
whether
or
not
intervenors
had
to
show
diversity.
another
area
that
we
have
which
was
--
which
develops
some
terrible
law
was
in
the
effect
of
a
judgment.
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
burden
of
my
argument
will
be
that
those
two
are
bound
up.
if
you
are
going
to
bind
a
class
with
the
judgment
then
you
have
the
amount
in
controversy
is
the
effect
of
that
judgment
on
the
class
and
that's
the
value
you
have
to
look
at.
but
in
under
old
rule
23,
when
we
got
down
to
the
effect
of
the
judgment,
we
developed
the
set
of
laws
which
said
that
in
true
class
actions
those
really
involved
in
property
or
something
directly
related
to,
all
of
the
class
was
bound.
in
hybrid
class
actions,
they
were
bound
but
to
a
lesser
extent
and
under
different
circumstances
and
frankly
there
were
so
many
different
decisions
that
i
haven't
been
able
to
figure
out
when
they're
bound
and
when
they're
not
in
a
hybrid
class
action.
in
a
spurious
class
action,
the
law
is
clear
that
no
one
in
the
class
is
bound
except
those
who
intervene.
but
--
and
that
seems
reasonable,
somewhat
reasonable
until
you
carried
another
step.
the
practice
developed
of
starting
a
spurious
class
action.
the
other
members
of
the
class
who
were
aware
of
this
anomaly
which
sit
on
the
outside
and
able
to
wait
until
the
case
was
adjudicated
or
almost
adjudicated
until
it
became
clear
that
the
plaintiff
was
going
to
win
then
they'd
come
in
and
intervene,
say
we
want
the
benefits
of
the
decree.
but
the
problem
was
that
it
was
a
one
way
intervention.
they
could
stay
out
and
not
be
bound
if
the
--
if
the
defendant
won
and
they
could
come
in
and
be
bound
if
the
plaintiff
won.
further
than
that
the
courts
quickly
confronted
themselves
with
this
problem.
here
is
what
we
call
a
class
action.
the
literature
says,
it
really
isn't
a
class
action,
it's
a
permissive
joinder.
one
of
the
plaintiffs,
one
of
the
members
of
the
class
stays
out
for
a
while.
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
was
no
requirement
that
he
be
given
notice.
he
might
not
know
that
he
was
being
represented
in
court
or
not
represented
depending
on
how
the
court
viewed
it
but
in
any
event
he
stayed
out.
he
finally
learned
a
bit
or
decided
he
would
come
in
and
he
comes
in
and
the
defendant
says
well.
this
is
a
spurious
class
action.
it
isn't
really
a
class
action.
you're
claim
is
barred
by
the
statute
of
limitations
whereas
the
plaintiff,
the
original
member
of
the
class,
his
claim
is
not.
well
now,
there's
many
way
to
--
you
can't
reconcile
these
conflicting
interests.
there
were
other
problems
that
crop
up
in
trying
to
pigeonhole
the
class
action.
in
effect
what
professor
moore
did
to
is
and
the
advisory
committee
in
the
framing
of
the
original
rule
was
to
lead
us
down
the
same
path
as
the
old
common
law
pleaders.
we
were
trying
--
mr.
robert
martin
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
martin
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
martin
well,
that's
what
one
wonders.
i
don't
--
personally
i
don't
agree
with
the
--
from
the
standpoint
of
personal
philosophy,
i
don't
agree
that
it
was
only
a
permissive
joinder
device
but
that
became
the
law
or
at
least
everybody
thought
it
was
the
law.
i
don't
agree
with
that.
i
think
it
was
intended
to
be
something
more
and
what
i'm
saying
is
that
at
the
present
time
under
amended
rule
23,
it
is
something
more
and
it
should
be
the
--
as
i
see
it,
the
effect
of
amending
rule
23
wasn't
really
amendment
but
it
was
a
complete
redrafting.
the
effect
of
that
has
been
to
eliminate
just
exactly
the
problem
that
you
mentioned.
we
--
i
don
think
now
we
have
any
such
thing
as
a
spurious
class
action.
i
don't
think
we
have
any
such
thing
as
a
hybrid
class
action.
i
think
that
now
for
the
first
time
and
as
it
should
be,
all
class
actions
are
true
class
actions.
you
--
mr.
robert
martin
yes,
sir.
but
(b)
(1),
(b)
(2),
(b)
(3)
cannot
be
related
to
true
hybrid
or
spurious
either
historically
or
in
the
context
of
the
rule.
what
really
has
happened
under
amended
rule
23
and
the
answer
to
counsel's
argument
that
the
amended
rule
is
going
to
vastly
increase
the
case
burden
of
the
federal
courts
is
the
rule
itself.
rule
23
has
now
amended
or
new
rule
23
as
i
will
call
it
provides
a
very
workable
precise
and
careful
description
of
what
is
and
what
is
not
a
class
action.
now
there
is
a
little
different
treatment
in
terms
of
procedure
given
to
a
class
action
in
which
the
cohesive
force
of
the
class
is
a
common
question
of
law
or
fact
in
an
interest
--
the
common
interest
in
relief.
as
distinguished
from
that
situation
in
which
the
cohesive
force
of
the
class
is
a
joint
interest
in
property
or
a
fund.
but
it's
a
procedural
difference
and
nothing
more.
it
isn't
the
difference
in
substance
and
it
ought
not
to
be.
mr.
robert
martin
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
martin
he
could
in
state
court
and
there
might
be
one.
we've
stipulated
that
we
don't
know
any
and
i
don't
know
of
any
but
i
suspect
that
they
are
industrial
users
who
would
have
$10,000.00
and
could
bring
one
in
federal
court
but
i
don't
know
that.
mr.
robert
martin
it
would
be,
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
martin
absolutely
not.
mr.
robert
martin
it
is
but
the
amount
in
controversy
even
though
they
might
by
permissive
joinder
style
themselves
as
plaintiffs
in
the
same
lawsuit
rather
than
separate
number
of
cases.
mr.
robert
martin
doesn't
change
the
fact
that
amount
in
controversy
truly
is
the
individual
claim
of
each
one.
mr.
robert
martin
that
wouldn't
make
any
difference.
mr.
robert
martin
well,
mr.
justice
white,
the
two
of
them
would
have
to
get
out
but
to
take
your
example,
one
of
them
could
say
or
all
three
of
them
could
say
we
are
not
going
to
--
mr.
robert
martin
we're
going
to
state
our
cause
under
rule
23
and
we
contend
that
this
is
in
fact
the
class
action.
now,
if
i
may
give
you
a
long
answer
to
that
question.
mr.
robert
martin
i
think
i
see
what
you
are
getting
at.
if
these
were
a
different
suit
and
there
were
three
members
of
the
class,
in
theory,
you
might
argue
that
they
could.
mr.
robert
martin
well,
no.
because
the
rule
--
the
court
would
not
apply
rule
23
label
because
the
--
mr.
robert
martin
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
martin
the
answer
to
your
question
is
that
it
would
be
very
rare
circumstance
where
that
can
conceivably
be
a
class
action
because
one
of
the
requirements
is
that
the
number
of
the
class
has
to
be
so
large
that
it
can't
effectively
be
brought
before
the
court.
mr.
robert
martin
well,
yes,
sir.
in
my
case
where
there
are
18,000
--
mr.
robert
martin
yes,
sir.
and
the
reason
for
that
is
that
if
three
or
five
or
get
together
or
one
comes
in
and
says
this
is
a
class
action
and
i
want
not
only
to
adjudicate
my
rights
but
the
rights
of
the
classes
hold
then
the
changed
procedure
is
this.
the
federal
court
is
then
required
to
give
notice
to
all
of
the
identifiable
members
of
the
class
and
inform
the
members
of
the
class
that
this
action
has
been
brought
as
a
class
action
on
their
behalf
who
the
plaintiffs
are
and
that
they
will
be
bound
by
the
judgment
unless
they
come
in
and
option
themselves
out
that
they
have
they
right
to
come
in
and
option
themselves
out
but
they
also
have
the
right
to
appear
or
not
appear.
in
other
words
you
must
give
a
practical
notice
then
he
is
required
under
the
new
rule
to
proceed
as
quickly
as
possible
to
determine
whether
this
properly
is
a
class
action
and
their
various
factors
he
must
consider.
one
of
the
things
that
he
must
determine
is
that
the
classes
so
numerous
that
class
actions
justify
that
the
plaintiffs
whether
they
will
be
one
or
three
are
in
position
fairly
to
represent
--
present
the
interest
of
the
class,
then
he
must
consider
as
additional
factors
under
(b)
(3)
action
that
the
--
the
class
action
method
is
superior
to
any
other
available
procedure
for
the
adjudication
of
these
claims.
he
must
also
determine
if
the
cases
to
be
maintained
as
a
class
action
that
the
interest
of
the
--
what
the
interest
is
of
the
individuals
that
are
controlling
the
litigation,
he
must
take
into
account
any
other
suits
that
are
pending
or
any
right
on
the
part
of
any
individuals
to
separately
litigate
their
claims
and
any
difficulties
in
management
of
this
class
action.
it
gives
him
precise
standards
but
broad
discretionary
powers.
now
and
he
must
determine
that
at
the
beginning
of
the
case
before
he
takes
another
step.
now,
the
burden
of
my
argument
really
is
that
whether
it's
(b)
(3)
action
as
counsel
says
this
one
is
and
i
agree.
we
pleaded
it
is
a
(b)
(3)
action
but
we
could
have
pleaded
it
as
a
--
under
one
of
the
other
situations.
if
the
court
has
made
that
determination,
then
it
is
a
class
action
and
if
enough
people
come
in
and
decide
that
they
want
to
be
optioned
out,
that
of
course
should
indicate
to
the
court
that
it
is
properly
a
class
action
that
there
are
reasons
why
individuals
want
to
adjudicate
their
own
claims
if
two
or
three
out
of
18,000
would
come
in
and
opt
out
as
professor
captain
(ph)
puts
it,
that
would
be
alright.
mr.
robert
martin
they
are.
mr.
robert
martin
i
say
mr.
justice
white
that
they
are
individual
claims
until
the
court
says
this
is
a
proper
class
action.
at
that
minute
--
mr.
robert
martin
the
claims
have
--
mr.
robert
martin
--
swallowed
up
--
mr.
robert
martin
yes.
mr.
robert
martin
yes
sir.
and
as
proof
of
that
as
an
example,
they
can't
dismiss
the
case
except
with
consent
of
the
court
and
notice
to
all
of
the
other
members
of
the
class.
they
lose
control
of
their
own
litigation
and
they
should.
mr.
robert
martin
i
haven't
had
a
chance
to
think
that
went
through
whether
mr.
justice
white,
a
plaintiff,
could
come
in
and
start
the
lawsuit
and
then
option
themselves
out.
i
suppose
he
could
if
turned
it
over
to
someone
else.
mr.
robert
martin
but
he
cannot
dismiss
the
lawsuit
and
that's
the
answer
to
the
jurisdictional
question.
everyone
there
is
bound
and
justice
frankfurter
in
1942
really
--
mr.
robert
martin
yes
they
would
but
the
other
--
mr.
robert
martin
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
martin
well,
this
would
be
true,
they
would
be
bound
but
the
defendant
would
not
be
bound
as
to
the
other
members
of
the
class
mr.
justice
white
and
the
other
members
of
the
class
would
not
be
bound
by
them.
mr.
robert
martin
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
martin
i'm
not
saying
mr.
justice
white
that
that
is
the
only
--
that
it
necessarily
follows
from
that.
i'm
not
saying
that
that's
the
only
argument
in
favor
of
aggregation.
i
am
saying
that
that
is
one
of
the
strong
arguments
and
historically
that
has
really
been
the
effect
here
when
the
subject
matter
of
the
litigation
is
shown
to
have
the
value
of
more
than
$10,000.00,
there
is
no
reason
why
a
federal
court
ought
not
to
proceed.
it's
a
question
of
the
procedure
by
which
you
reach
this
ultimate
objective.
you
see
in
the
prior
rule
23,
there
was
no
way
by
which
in
a
spurious
class
action
for
example,
the
court
could
ever
force
that
decree
off
on
someone
else.
it
just
could
not
be
done
therefore
it
was
not
correct
to
say
that
the
amount
in
controversy
was
the
amount
that
that
is
the
total
value
of
the
rights
of
the
class
because
the
rights
of
the
class
were
not
to
be
effective,
only
the
rights
of
the
actual
parties
litigant.
now
--
mr.
robert
martin
yes,
sir
it
does
and
it
is
--
mr.
robert
martin
--
in
my
judgment
sir.
mr.
robert
martin
well,
it
has
mr.
justice
white
but
this
court
has
answered
that
question
in
a
companion
matter
which
is
the
consideration
of
the
amendment
of
rule
19
in
the
provident
bank
&
trust
company
versus
patterson,
that
decision
came
down
in
january
and
i
think
that
the
situation
that
mr.
justice
harlan
described
there
and
the
argument
that
he
rejected
is
really
the
argument
of
the
petitioner
here
and
the
respondent
prior
case.
what
they
are
really
saying
is
that
this
old
concept
of
aggregation
in
common
property
suits
was
alright
but
in
other
suits
was
wrong
or
not
permissible
that
that
establishes
a
common
law
which
is
inflexible,
a
substantive
right
and
no
matter
how
we
change
the
rule,
we
can't
get
rid
of
this
pigeonholes
of
true,
hybrid,
and
spurious.
that
--
that's
not
really
so
and
it
ought
not
to
be
so.
those
cases
were
somewhat
similar
to
the
cases
that
mr.
justice
harlan
said
--
described
as
the
19th
century
joinder
cases.
that
really
is
some
of
the
same
cases
and
they
don't
establish
--
mr.
robert
martin
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
martin
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
martin
yes,
sir.
that
is
what
i
say.
mr.
robert
martin
yes
sir,
if
you
would
say
mr.
justice
fortas
that
subsection
(b)
really
limits
the
general
statement
or
the
earlier
proposition
that
the
district
court
have
original
jurisdiction
when
the
amount
in
controversy
is
$10,000.00.
mr.
robert
martin
that's
really
right.
in
subsection
(b)
that
you've
just
read
is
the
only
thing
in
the
rule
or
the
statute
that
gives
any
hint
that
it
is
the
claim
of
a
plaintiff.
the
answer
--
the
best
answer
that
i
can
give
you
and
i
have
considered
this,
the
best
answer
i
can
give
you
is
that
aggregation
in
some
circumstances,
the
ones
i
described
was
allowable
when
that
statute
was
passed.
mr.
robert
martin
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
martin
your
honor
has
made
my
submission
on
the
second
point,
that
is
exactly
--
that
is
exactly
what
i
intend
to
say
and
i
think
that
should
be
the
rule,
i
believe
that
is
the
rule.
i
want
to
fortify
the
proposition
with
the
statement
that
originally,
century
ago,
more
than
a
century
starting
i
think
in
1843,
we
first
begin
to
have
these
questions,
this
--
the
circumstances
where
aggregation
was
allowed
were
really
comparable
in
terms
of
commerce
then
and
in
terms
of
the
lack
of
complexity
of
litigation
then
as
compared
to
now.
they
were
allowing
aggregation
where
it
should
be
allowed,
where
the
matter
in
controversy
was
$10,000.00
or
at
that
time
$500.00
or
more.
all
i'm
saying
is
that
procedures
like
suits
of
clothes
ware
out
and
no
longer
fit
the
necessities
of
commerce
and
human
relations
and
that's
what
has
happened
with
the
old
concept
of
true,
hybrid,
and
spurious
and
that's
what
happened
with
rule
23
originally,
it
wore
up
in
25
years.
and
i
think
that
the
present
rule
that
we
have
now,
the
amended
rule
is
splendid,
will
solve
the
problem
and
directs
itself
to
the
problem.
there
is
no
reason
why
to
get
back
to
one
of
mr.
justice
marshall's
question
yesterday.
if
the
court
adopts
the
view
urged
by
the
petitioner
here,
we
are
going
to
have
a
situation
where
the
only
people
who
can
represent
the
class
are
those
who
have
$10,000.00
or
more.
the
other
people,
there
might
be
another
man
who
has
$10,000.00
even,
that's
his
claim,
a
stockholder
and
we
are
saying
to
him
you
can't
come
in,
you
can't
start
the
action,
you
can't
represent
the
class
but
to
mr.
b
who
has
$10,000.01,
you
can,
the
door
of
the
courthouse
is
open
to
you.
well,
the
arbitrary
limit
is
fine
in
private
litigation.
it
must
be
made
to
limit
litigation
in
federal
courts
but
when
in
reality,
when
the
man
comes
in
to
court,
he
presents
and
there
is
adjudicated
not
only
his
claim
but
a
whole
class
of
claims,
it
doesn't
make
any
sense.
it
isn't
logical
and
it
isn't
--
it
doesn't
afford
what
the
procedure
that
is
necessary.
one
further
comment
--
mr.
robert
martin
yes,
sir.
i
believe
that's
quite
correct.
one
of
the
things
that
he
would
find
out
when
he
makes
the
determinations
which
must
be
made
before
the
action
can
be
maintained,
one
of
the
things
of
course
he
would
find
out
is
whether
we
are
dealing
with
a
small
class
action,
a
piece
of
petty
litigation
where
really
the
class
only
--
mr.
robert
martin
i
believe
the
answer
to
your
question
mr.
justice
marshall
is
that
if
you
have
that
situation,
a
possible
$100,000.00
class,
the
action
started
by
someone
who
has
a
smaller
claim
of
10,000
and
all
of
the
members
of
the
class
or
sufficient
number
of
members
of
the
class
to
bring
the
claims
down
below
10,000
opt
out,
then
i
think
the
court
has
lost
jurisdiction,
the
court
should
dismiss
the
case
and
there
for
of
many
reasons,
one
of
them
being
that
--
mr.
robert
martin
the
amount
in
controversy
mr.
justice
marshall
is
really
what
mr.
justice
frankfurter
said
it
was
in
1942.
he
said
that
in
diversity
actions
and
he
wasn't
talking
about
class
actions
but
this
is
what
i
--
this
is
my
argument.
he
said
that
in
diversity
actions,
the
amount
in
controversy
is
measured
not
by
the
monetary
result
of
determining
the
principle
involved
but
by
the
pecuniary
consequences
to
those
involved
in
the
litigation.
now,
to
answer
your
question,
the
pecuniary
consequences
to
those
involved
in
the
litigation
in
the
class
action
ones
it's
determined
that
it
is
a
class
action
consists
of
everybody
whose
bound
by
it,
the
defendant
as
--
mr.
robert
martin
in
my
claim
i
think
your
honors
are
even
better
than
that
and
it
should
be.
thank
you.
mr.
robert
martin
no,
sir.
in
my
view
it
does
not
affect
diversity
jurisdiction
and
of
course
this
was
one
of
the
anomalies
under
old
rule
23,
we
were
saying
spurious
class
actions
were
not
really
class
actions
and
yet
we
were
allowing
people
to
come
in
who
couldn't
show
diversity
and
we
were
in
hybrid
actions,
we
were
binding
people
who
had
no
diversity,
they
were
bound
and
they
couldn't
litigate
it.
mr.
robert
martin
it
can
bring
the
action
and
they
couldn't
really
litigate
it.
mr.
robert
martin
i
say
the
situation
now
is
that
if
the
original
plaintiffs
show
diversity
of
citizenship,
then
anyone
who
doesn't
opt
out
can't
benefit
himself
from
the
decree
and
is
bound
by
it
regardless
of
his
citizenship.
mr.
robert
martin
no,
sir.
in
my
view
it
does
not
and
it
really
didn't
under
old
rule
23.
mr.
robert
martin
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
martin
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
we
have
two
platforms
from
which
to
look
at
the
question
before
the
court.
the
first
one
being
the
proper
effect
and
interpretation
of
amended
rule
23
and
the
second
one
being
whether
there
is
any
substance
to
the
argument
here
that
the
effect
of
the
amended
rule
is
to
extend
the
jurisdiction
of
federal
courts
unlawfully.
now,
most
of
the
questions
that
if
occurred
or
that
had
been
asked
from
the
bench
in
the
preceding
case
and
in
this
case
really
concerned
the
first
question,
the
proper
interpretation
and
application
and
practical
effect
of
rule
23
on
class
litigation.
so,
i
want
to
address
myself
to
that
aspect
of
what
we
have
before
us
first.
i'm
embarrassed
to
say
that
i
have
a
somewhat
different
view
of
amended
rule
23
than
seems
to
be
the
view
by
any
of
the
three
preceding
counsel.
i
see
rule
23
as
it's
now
amended
as
an
attempt
to
straighten
out
and
do
away
with
some
terrible
problems
that
confronted
us
in
the
practical
application
of
former
rule
23
and
very
briefly
what
i
am
referring
to
is
this.
former
rule
23
did
have
its
origin
as
one
of
the
counsel
stated
in
the
old
equity
rules
but
when
rule
23
was
promulgated,
it
appears
from
the
history
that
professor
moore
undertook
to
categorize
the
circumstances
under
which
you
could
have
a
class
action
and
he
came
up
with
a
three
categories
which
were
not
resided
in
the
rule
by
name
but
were
described
really
in
subdivisions
(a)
(1),
(2)
and
(3)
of
true
hybrid
and
spurious.
now
he
thought
and
i
think
the
bar
thought
and
you
can
find
in
the
literature
statements
by
writers
to
the
effect
that
this
was
a
clear
rule
and
plain
english
and
everybody
could
understand
it.
i
think
everyone
thought
that
those
categories
are
going
to
work
well
and
they
do
work
well
when
you're
talking
about
property
rights
and
they
had
some
historical
basis.
if
you
were
bringing
a
--
if
two
people
were
joined
together
to
--
as
plaintiffs
to
try
title
to
quarter
section
of
land,
what
any
problem
to
understand
that
they
could
aggregate
their
claims,
they
were
all
going
to
be
bound
by
the
judgment,
you
really
had
one
piece
of
litigation.
and
we
have
what
we
call
in
rem
jurisdiction
and
all
these
things
were
familiar
to
lawyers
and
they
understood
them.
mr.
robert
martin
yes,
sir.
and
it
was
really
aggregation
of
plaintiffs
and
not
aggregation
of
claims
at
all.
now,
professor
moore
attempted
to
apply
that
the
class
actions
and
i
think
the
history
demonstrates
that
it
works
well
when
you're
dealing
with
property
or
a
fund
but
class
actions
very
quickly
became
broader
than
that.
there
were
all
kinds
of
rights
and
all
kinds
of
situations
developed
chiefly
by
modern
commerce
that
demanded,
cried
out
for
adjudication
by
class
action.
and
it
isn't
a
question
of
increasing
case,
load
as
a
question
of
decreasing
and
when
we
try
to
extend
these
categories
beyond
property
rights,
we
got
into
trouble
and
we
got
in
to
bad
trouble.
rule
23
left
cases
spread
over
our
reports
that
simply
couldn't
be
rationalized
or
harmonized
in
certain
areas,
one
of
them
being
the
question
of
jurisdiction
that
we
have
before
us
both
as
to
amount
and
as
to
diversity.
now,
there
was
no
problem
about
aggregation
when
you
talked
about
a
claim
to
try
title
where
you
have
more
than
one
party
but
when
you
got
down
to
what
professor
moore
termed
and
the
committee
termed
a
spurious
class
action.
you
have
the
literature
which
said
this
really
isn't
a
class
action
at
all.
this
is
a
permissive
joinder
device.
well
then,
you
were
face
to
face
with
this
problem
not
only
as
to
jurisdictional
amount
but
as
to
whether
or
not
intervenors
had
to
show
diversity.
another
area
that
we
have
which
was
--
which
develops
some
terrible
law
was
in
the
effect
of
a
judgment.
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
burden
of
my
argument
will
be
that
those
two
are
bound
up.
if
you
are
going
to
bind
a
class
with
the
judgment
then
you
have
the
amount
in
controversy
is
the
effect
of
that
judgment
on
the
class
and
that's
the
value
you
have
to
look
at.
but
in
under
old
rule
23,
when
we
got
down
to
the
effect
of
the
judgment,
we
developed
the
set
of
laws
which
said
that
in
true
class
actions
those
really
involved
in
property
or
something
directly
related
to,
all
of
the
class
was
bound.
in
hybrid
class
actions,
they
were
bound
but
to
a
lesser
extent
and
under
different
circumstances
and
frankly
there
were
so
many
different
decisions
that
i
haven't
been
able
to
figure
out
when
they're
bound
and
when
they're
not
in
a
hybrid
class
action.
in
a
spurious
class
action,
the
law
is
clear
that
no
one
in
the
class
is
bound
except
those
who
intervene.
but
--
and
that
seems
reasonable,
somewhat
reasonable
until
you
carried
another
step.
the
practice
developed
of
starting
a
spurious
class
action.
the
other
members
of
the
class
who
were
aware
of
this
anomaly
which
sit
on
the
outside
and
able
to
wait
until
the
case
was
adjudicated
or
almost
adjudicated
until
it
became
clear
that
the
plaintiff
was
going
to
win
then
they'd
come
in
and
intervene,
say
we
want
the
benefits
of
the
decree.
but
the
problem
was
that
it
was
a
one
way
intervention.
they
could
stay
out
and
not
be
bound
if
the
--
if
the
defendant
won
and
they
could
come
in
and
be
bound
if
the
plaintiff
won.
further
than
that
the
courts
quickly
confronted
themselves
with
this
problem.
here
is
what
we
call
a
class
action.
the
literature
says,
it
really
isn't
a
class
action,
it's
a
permissive
joinder.
one
of
the
plaintiffs,
one
of
the
members
of
the
class
stays
out
for
a
while.
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
was
no
requirement
that
he
be
given
notice.
he
might
not
know
that
he
was
being
represented
in
court
or
not
represented
depending
on
how
the
court
viewed
it
but
in
any
event
he
stayed
out.
he
finally
learned
a
bit
or
decided
he
would
come
in
and
he
comes
in
and
the
defendant
says
well.
this
is
a
spurious
class
action.
it
isn't
really
a
class
action.
you're
claim
is
barred
by
the
statute
of
limitations
whereas
the
plaintiff,
the
original
member
of
the
class,
his
claim
is
not.
well
now,
there's
many
way
to
--
you
can't
reconcile
these
conflicting
interests.
there
were
other
problems
that
crop
up
in
trying
to
pigeonhole
the
class
action.
in
effect
what
professor
moore
did
to
is
and
the
advisory
committee
in
the
framing
of
the
original
rule
was
to
lead
us
down
the
same
path
as
the
old
common
law
pleaders.
we
were
trying
--
mr.
robert
martin
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
martin
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
martin
well,
that's
what
one
wonders.
i
don't
--
personally
i
don't
agree
with
the
--
from
the
standpoint
of
personal
philosophy,
i
don't
agree
that
it
was
only
a
permissive
joinder
device
but
that
became
the
law
or
at
least
everybody
thought
it
was
the
law.
i
don't
agree
with
that.
i
think
it
was
intended
to
be
something
more
and
what
i'm
saying
is
that
at
the
present
time
under
amended
rule
23,
it
is
something
more
and
it
should
be
the
--
as
i
see
it,
the
effect
of
amending
rule
23
wasn't
really
amendment
but
it
was
a
complete
redrafting.
the
effect
of
that
has
been
to
eliminate
just
exactly
the
problem
that
you
mentioned.
we
--
i
don
think
now
we
have
any
such
thing
as
a
spurious
class
action.
i
don't
think
we
have
any
such
thing
as
a
hybrid
class
action.
i
think
that
now
for
the
first
time
and
as
it
should
be,
all
class
actions
are
true
class
actions.
you
--
mr.
robert
martin
yes,
sir.
but
(b)
(1),
(b)
(2),
(b)
(3)
cannot
be
related
to
true
hybrid
or
spurious
either
historically
or
in
the
context
of
the
rule.
what
really
has
happened
under
amended
rule
23
and
the
answer
to
counsel's
argument
that
the
amended
rule
is
going
to
vastly
increase
the
case
burden
of
the
federal
courts
is
the
rule
itself.
rule
23
has
now
amended
or
new
rule
23
as
i
will
call
it
provides
a
very
workable
precise
and
careful
description
of
what
is
and
what
is
not
a
class
action.
now
there
is
a
little
different
treatment
in
terms
of
procedure
given
to
a
class
action
in
which
the
cohesive
force
of
the
class
is
a
common
question
of
law
or
fact
in
an
interest
--
the
common
interest
in
relief.
as
distinguished
from
that
situation
in
which
the
cohesive
force
of
the
class
is
a
joint
interest
in
property
or
a
fund.
but
it's
a
procedural
difference
and
nothing
more.
it
isn't
the
difference
in
substance
and
it
ought
not
to
be.
mr.
robert
martin
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
martin
he
could
in
state
court
and
there
might
be
one.
we've
stipulated
that
we
don't
know
any
and
i
don't
know
of
any
but
i
suspect
that
they
are
industrial
users
who
would
have
$10,000.00
and
could
bring
one
in
federal
court
but
i
don't
know
that.
mr.
robert
martin
it
would
be,
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
martin
absolutely
not.
mr.
robert
martin
it
is
but
the
amount
in
controversy
even
though
they
might
by
permissive
joinder
style
themselves
as
plaintiffs
in
the
same
lawsuit
rather
than
separate
number
of
cases.
mr.
robert
martin
doesn't
change
the
fact
that
amount
in
controversy
truly
is
the
individual
claim
of
each
one.
mr.
robert
martin
that
wouldn't
make
any
difference.
mr.
robert
martin
well,
mr.
justice
white,
the
two
of
them
would
have
to
get
out
but
to
take
your
example,
one
of
them
could
say
or
all
three
of
them
could
say
we
are
not
going
to
--
mr.
robert
martin
we're
going
to
state
our
cause
under
rule
23
and
we
contend
that
this
is
in
fact
the
class
action.
now,
if
i
may
give
you
a
long
answer
to
that
question.
mr.
robert
martin
i
think
i
see
what
you
are
getting
at.
if
these
were
a
different
suit
and
there
were
three
members
of
the
class,
in
theory,
you
might
argue
that
they
could.
mr.
robert
martin
well,
no.
because
the
rule
--
the
court
would
not
apply
rule
23
label
because
the
--
mr.
robert
martin
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
martin
the
answer
to
your
question
is
that
it
would
be
very
rare
circumstance
where
that
can
conceivably
be
a
class
action
because
one
of
the
requirements
is
that
the
number
of
the
class
has
to
be
so
large
that
it
can't
effectively
be
brought
before
the
court.
mr.
robert
martin
well,
yes,
sir.
in
my
case
where
there
are
18,000
--
mr.
robert
martin
yes,
sir.
and
the
reason
for
that
is
that
if
three
or
five
or
get
together
or
one
comes
in
and
says
this
is
a
class
action
and
i
want
not
only
to
adjudicate
my
rights
but
the
rights
of
the
classes
hold
then
the
changed
procedure
is
this.
the
federal
court
is
then
required
to
give
notice
to
all
of
the
identifiable
members
of
the
class
and
inform
the
members
of
the
class
that
this
action
has
been
brought
as
a
class
action
on
their
behalf
who
the
plaintiffs
are
and
that
they
will
be
bound
by
the
judgment
unless
they
come
in
and
option
themselves
out
that
they
have
they
right
to
come
in
and
option
themselves
out
but
they
also
have
the
right
to
appear
or
not
appear.
in
other
words
you
must
give
a
practical
notice
then
he
is
required
under
the
new
rule
to
proceed
as
quickly
as
possible
to
determine
whether
this
properly
is
a
class
action
and
their
various
factors
he
must
consider.
one
of
the
things
that
he
must
determine
is
that
the
classes
so
numerous
that
class
actions
justify
that
the
plaintiffs
whether
they
will
be
one
or
three
are
in
position
fairly
to
represent
--
present
the
interest
of
the
class,
then
he
must
consider
as
additional
factors
under
(b)
(3)
action
that
the
--
the
class
action
method
is
superior
to
any
other
available
procedure
for
the
adjudication
of
these
claims.
he
must
also
determine
if
the
cases
to
be
maintained
as
a
class
action
that
the
interest
of
the
--
what
the
interest
is
of
the
individuals
that
are
controlling
the
litigation,
he
must
take
into
account
any
other
suits
that
are
pending
or
any
right
on
the
part
of
any
individuals
to
separately
litigate
their
claims
and
any
difficulties
in
management
of
this
class
action.
it
gives
him
precise
standards
but
broad
discretionary
powers.
now
and
he
must
determine
that
at
the
beginning
of
the
case
before
he
takes
another
step.
now,
the
burden
of
my
argument
really
is
that
whether
it's
(b)
(3)
action
as
counsel
says
this
one
is
and
i
agree.
we
pleaded
it
is
a
(b)
(3)
action
but
we
could
have
pleaded
it
as
a
--
under
one
of
the
other
situations.
if
the
court
has
made
that
determination,
then
it
is
a
class
action
and
if
enough
people
come
in
and
decide
that
they
want
to
be
optioned
out,
that
of
course
should
indicate
to
the
court
that
it
is
properly
a
class
action
that
there
are
reasons
why
individuals
want
to
adjudicate
their
own
claims
if
two
or
three
out
of
18,000
would
come
in
and
opt
out
as
professor
captain
(ph)
puts
it,
that
would
be
alright.
mr.
robert
martin
they
are.
mr.
robert
martin
i
say
mr.
justice
white
that
they
are
individual
claims
until
the
court
says
this
is
a
proper
class
action.
at
that
minute
--
mr.
robert
martin
the
claims
have
--
mr.
robert
martin
--
swallowed
up
--
mr.
robert
martin
yes.
mr.
robert
martin
yes
sir.
and
as
proof
of
that
as
an
example,
they
can't
dismiss
the
case
except
with
consent
of
the
court
and
notice
to
all
of
the
other
members
of
the
class.
they
lose
control
of
their
own
litigation
and
they
should.
mr.
robert
martin
i
haven't
had
a
chance
to
think
that
went
through
whether
mr.
justice
white,
a
plaintiff,
could
come
in
and
start
the
lawsuit
and
then
option
themselves
out.
i
suppose
he
could
if
turned
it
over
to
someone
else.
mr.
robert
martin
but
he
cannot
dismiss
the
lawsuit
and
that's
the
answer
to
the
jurisdictional
question.
everyone
there
is
bound
and
justice
frankfurter
in
1942
really
--
mr.
robert
martin
yes
they
would
but
the
other
--
mr.
robert
martin
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
martin
well,
this
would
be
true,
they
would
be
bound
but
the
defendant
would
not
be
bound
as
to
the
other
members
of
the
class
mr.
justice
white
and
the
other
members
of
the
class
would
not
be
bound
by
them.
mr.
robert
martin
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
martin
i'm
not
saying
mr.
justice
white
that
that
is
the
only
--
that
it
necessarily
follows
from
that.
i'm
not
saying
that
that's
the
only
argument
in
favor
of
aggregation.
i
am
saying
that
that
is
one
of
the
strong
arguments
and
historically
that
has
really
been
the
effect
here
when
the
subject
matter
of
the
litigation
is
shown
to
have
the
value
of
more
than
$10,000.00,
there
is
no
reason
why
a
federal
court
ought
not
to
proceed.
it's
a
question
of
the
procedure
by
which
you
reach
this
ultimate
objective.
you
see
in
the
prior
rule
23,
there
was
no
way
by
which
in
a
spurious
class
action
for
example,
the
court
could
ever
force
that
decree
off
on
someone
else.
it
just
could
not
be
done
therefore
it
was
not
correct
to
say
that
the
amount
in
controversy
was
the
amount
that
that
is
the
total
value
of
the
rights
of
the
class
because
the
rights
of
the
class
were
not
to
be
effective,
only
the
rights
of
the
actual
parties
litigant.
now
--
mr.
robert
martin
yes,
sir
it
does
and
it
is
--
mr.
robert
martin
--
in
my
judgment
sir.
mr.
robert
martin
well,
it
has
mr.
justice
white
but
this
court
has
answered
that
question
in
a
companion
matter
which
is
the
consideration
of
the
amendment
of
rule
19
in
the
provident
bank
&
trust
company
versus
patterson,
that
decision
came
down
in
january
and
i
think
that
the
situation
that
mr.
justice
harlan
described
there
and
the
argument
that
he
rejected
is
really
the
argument
of
the
petitioner
here
and
the
respondent
prior
case.
what
they
are
really
saying
is
that
this
old
concept
of
aggregation
in
common
property
suits
was
alright
but
in
other
suits
was
wrong
or
not
permissible
that
that
establishes
a
common
law
which
is
inflexible,
a
substantive
right
and
no
matter
how
we
change
the
rule,
we
can't
get
rid
of
this
pigeonholes
of
true,
hybrid,
and
spurious.
that
--
that's
not
really
so
and
it
ought
not
to
be
so.
those
cases
were
somewhat
similar
to
the
cases
that
mr.
justice
harlan
said
--
described
as
the
19th
century
joinder
cases.
that
really
is
some
of
the
same
cases
and
they
don't
establish
--
mr.
robert
martin
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
martin
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
martin
yes,
sir.
that
is
what
i
say.
mr.
robert
martin
yes
sir,
if
you
would
say
mr.
justice
fortas
that
subsection
(b)
really
limits
the
general
statement
or
the
earlier
proposition
that
the
district
court
have
original
jurisdiction
when
the
amount
in
controversy
is
$10,000.00.
mr.
robert
martin
that's
really
right.
in
subsection
(b)
that
you've
just
read
is
the
only
thing
in
the
rule
or
the
statute
that
gives
any
hint
that
it
is
the
claim
of
a
plaintiff.
the
answer
--
the
best
answer
that
i
can
give
you
and
i
have
considered
this,
the
best
answer
i
can
give
you
is
that
aggregation
in
some
circumstances,
the
ones
i
described
was
allowable
when
that
statute
was
passed.
mr.
robert
martin
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
martin
your
honor
has
made
my
submission
on
the
second
point,
that
is
exactly
--
that
is
exactly
what
i
intend
to
say
and
i
think
that
should
be
the
rule,
i
believe
that
is
the
rule.
i
want
to
fortify
the
proposition
with
the
statement
that
originally,
century
ago,
more
than
a
century
starting
i
think
in
1843,
we
first
begin
to
have
these
questions,
this
--
the
circumstances
where
aggregation
was
allowed
were
really
comparable
in
terms
of
commerce
then
and
in
terms
of
the
lack
of
complexity
of
litigation
then
as
compared
to
now.
they
were
allowing
aggregation
where
it
should
be
allowed,
where
the
matter
in
controversy
was
$10,000.00
or
at
that
time
$500.00
or
more.
all
i'm
saying
is
that
procedures
like
suits
of
clothes
ware
out
and
no
longer
fit
the
necessities
of
commerce
and
human
relations
and
that's
what
has
happened
with
the
old
concept
of
true,
hybrid,
and
spurious
and
that's
what
happened
with
rule
23
originally,
it
wore
up
in
25
years.
and
i
think
that
the
present
rule
that
we
have
now,
the
amended
rule
is
splendid,
will
solve
the
problem
and
directs
itself
to
the
problem.
there
is
no
reason
why
to
get
back
to
one
of
mr.
justice
marshall's
question
yesterday.
if
the
court
adopts
the
view
urged
by
the
petitioner
here,
we
are
going
to
have
a
situation
where
the
only
people
who
can
represent
the
class
are
those
who
have
$10,000.00
or
more.
the
other
people,
there
might
be
another
man
who
has
$10,000.00
even,
that's
his
claim,
a
stockholder
and
we
are
saying
to
him
you
can't
come
in,
you
can't
start
the
action,
you
can't
represent
the
class
but
to
mr.
b
who
has
$10,000.01,
you
can,
the
door
of
the
courthouse
is
open
to
you.
well,
the
arbitrary
limit
is
fine
in
private
litigation.
it
must
be
made
to
limit
litigation
in
federal
courts
but
when
in
reality,
when
the
man
comes
in
to
court,
he
presents
and
there
is
adjudicated
not
only
his
claim
but
a
whole
class
of
claims,
it
doesn't
make
any
sense.
it
isn't
logical
and
it
isn't
--
it
doesn't
afford
what
the
procedure
that
is
necessary.
one
further
comment
--
mr.
robert
martin
yes,
sir.
i
believe
that's
quite
correct.
one
of
the
things
that
he
would
find
out
when
he
makes
the
determinations
which
must
be
made
before
the
action
can
be
maintained,
one
of
the
things
of
course
he
would
find
out
is
whether
we
are
dealing
with
a
small
class
action,
a
piece
of
petty
litigation
where
really
the
class
only
--
mr.
robert
martin
i
believe
the
answer
to
your
question
mr.
justice
marshall
is
that
if
you
have
that
situation,
a
possible
$100,000.00
class,
the
action
started
by
someone
who
has
a
smaller
claim
of
10,000
and
all
of
the
members
of
the
class
or
sufficient
number
of
members
of
the
class
to
bring
the
claims
down
below
10,000
opt
out,
then
i
think
the
court
has
lost
jurisdiction,
the
court
should
dismiss
the
case
and
there
for
of
many
reasons,
one
of
them
being
that
--
mr.
robert
martin
the
amount
in
controversy
mr.
justice
marshall
is
really
what
mr.
justice
frankfurter
said
it
was
in
1942.
he
said
that
in
diversity
actions
and
he
wasn't
talking
about
class
actions
but
this
is
what
i
--
this
is
my
argument.
he
said
that
in
diversity
actions,
the
amount
in
controversy
is
measured
not
by
the
monetary
result
of
determining
the
principle
involved
but
by
the
pecuniary
consequences
to
those
involved
in
the
litigation.
now,
to
answer
your
question,
the
pecuniary
consequences
to
those
involved
in
the
litigation
in
the
class
action
ones
it's
determined
that
it
is
a
class
action
consists
of
everybody
whose
bound
by
it,
the
defendant
as
--
mr.
robert
martin
in
my
claim
i
think
your
honors
are
even
better
than
that
and
it
should
be.
thank
you.
mr.
robert
martin
no,
sir.
in
my
view
it
does
not
affect
diversity
jurisdiction
and
of
course
this
was
one
of
the
anomalies
under
old
rule
23,
we
were
saying
spurious
class
actions
were
not
really
class
actions
and
yet
we
were
allowing
people
to
come
in
who
couldn't
show
diversity
and
we
were
in
hybrid
actions,
we
were
binding
people
who
had
no
diversity,
they
were
bound
and
they
couldn't
litigate
it.
mr.
robert
martin
it
can
bring
the
action
and
they
couldn't
really
litigate
it.
mr.
robert
martin
i
say
the
situation
now
is
that
if
the
original
plaintiffs
show
diversity
of
citizenship,
then
anyone
who
doesn't
opt
out
can't
benefit
himself
from
the
decree
and
is
bound
by
it
