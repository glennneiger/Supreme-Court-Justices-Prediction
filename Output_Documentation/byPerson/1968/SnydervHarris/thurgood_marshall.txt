there's

the

professor

doesn't

with

does

justice

suppose
the

$10,000.01.
justice
thurgood

suppose
the
petitioner
was
claiming
for
her
self
$10,000.01.
then
she
could
file
a
class
action?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
she
got
that
$10.01,
it
has
to
be
over
ten.
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
she
could
file
a
class
action?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
everything
would
attach
to
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
some
could
refuse
to
take
the
money.
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes
refused
to
take
the
money.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
isn't
it
also
true
that
the
old
rule
require
that
the
named
plaintiff
and
for
example
a
spurious
class
suit,
the
name
plaintiff
must
have
all
of
the
--
all
emphasize
underscore
jurisdictional
qualifications
to
maintain
the
action
as
an
individual,
isn't
that
the
old
rule?
justice
thurgood

but
the
spurious
class
action
required
that.
that
the
first
plaintiff
have
to
be
diversity
10,000
plus
3,000
it
was
then
plus
of
age
and
everything
and
then
the
class
was
mass
outside,
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
you
file
that,
the
only
amendment,
only
change
that
you
can
argue
for
would
be
that
the
one
person
would
have
to
set
it
then
anybody
could
come
in.
you
would
--
i
don't
see
how
you
can
argue
that
they're
asking
that
everybody
has
to
show
10,000.
i
don't
understand
the
argument
to
me,
not
at
all.
justice
thurgood
marshall
because
the
rules
cannot
touch
jurisdiction.
you
get
jurisdiction
out
of
the
code.
justice
thurgood

(voice

the
decisions
of
this
court?
justice
thurgood
marshall
should
we
look
to
the
decisions
of
this
court?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
what
the
respondent's
doing.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
can
as
the
larger
numbered
in
three
and
the--
justice
thurgood
marshall
larger
number
you
can't
really
ascertain.
justice
thurgood
marshall
oh,
i
assume
that
it
just
won't
--
this
investigation,
people
opt
out
and
all,
if
he
finds
it
is
less
than
10,000,
you
prove
the
case
out
preliminarily?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
the
point
that
worries
me,
if
you
go
on
to
matter
in
controversy
and
the
matter
in
controversy
is
$100,000.00
but
only
$10,000.00
worth
comes
in
and
the
rest
opt
out,
we
get
back
to
the
point
that
actual
amount
of
controversy,
the
actual
amount
is
being
claimed,
not
the
amount
that's
in
controversy,
that's
my
trouble.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that's
the
trouble,
what
is
the
amount
in
controversy?
the
amount
that
the
corporation
has
or
the
amount
that
people
claim?
justice
thurgood
marshall
at
least
your
claim
is
not
worth
than
the
average
diversity
claims
which
claims
a
$100,000.00
and
then
2
years
later
settled
it
to
500.
justice
