mr.
gerrit
h.
wormhoudt
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
action
was
commenced
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
court
of
kansas
also
as
a
class
suit
under
the
newly
amended
rule
23
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure.
the
plaintiff
brings
the
action
on
behalf
of
themselves
an
18,000
other
consumers
of
natural
gas
at
retail
upon
the
petitioner
in
this
case
who
was
a
public
utility
in
missouri
corporation
qualified
to
do
business
in
kansas.
the
petitioner
claims
that
or
complains
that
the
--
i
beg
your
pardon,
the
respondent
claims
that
the
petitioner
in
this
case
illegally
exacted
from
the
plaintiff
and
from
the
members
of
the
class
which
the
plaintiff
seeks
to
represent
and
illegally
imposed
franchise
charged
exacted
by
the
city
of
arkansas
city
in
cowley
county
kansas
that
this
charge
was
not
maintainable
beyond
the
city
limits
that
the
respondent
in
this
case
resides
beyond
the
city
limits
along
with
18,000
other
members
of
his
class.
diversity
did
exist,
jurisdictional
amount
was
pleaded.
the
petitioner
then
moved
in
the
district
court
to
dismiss
the
action,
the
motion
to
dismiss
was
supported
by
an
affidavit
indicating
that
during
a
probable
time
period
involved
here,
this
particular
respondent's
claim
would
have
amounted
to
$7.81.
during
the
course
of
argument,
counsel
for
the
respondent
frankly
stipulated
that
the
respondent's
claim
could
not
equal
$10,000.00
and
that
they
had
no
knowledge
of
any
other
member
of
the
class
whose
claim
would
equal
or
exceed
$10,000.00.
the
district
court
however
overruled
the
motion
to
dismiss.
it
did
in
its
order
make
the
necessary
determination
and
findings
permitting
petitioner
to
apply
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit
for
an
interlocutory
appeal,
that
application
was
granted
and
the
tenth
circuit
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
order
of
the
district
court
at
approximately
the
same
time
within
a
month
or
two
of
the
affirmation
of
the
district
court's
ruling
in
snyder
versus
harris.
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to
what
i
think
have
been
straw
men
raised
in
the
brief
of
the
respondent.
it
has
been
suggested
that
the
petitioner
in
this
case
is
seeking
to
confine
the
construction
of
the
amendments
to
the
rules
to
the
language
of
the
formal
rule
alleged
rule
23
and
the
horrible
parade
of
norman
clayture
that
developed
under
that
rule,
it
references
to
two
class
actions,
hybrid
class
actions,
and
superior
class
actions.
i
think
it
is
perfectly
abundant,
perfectly
clear
that
the
real
problem
involved
here
is
not
one
of
the
construction
of
prior
rule
23.
so
far
as
we're
concerned,
that
rule
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
present
action.
we
don't
rely
on
it.
we
find
it
unnecessary
to
refer
to
it.
we
do
think
that
jurisdictional
standards
first
as
adopted
by
congress
and
the
body
of
case
law
which
has
developed
around
those
jurisdictional
standards
is
one
set
of
rules
and
one
body
of
law.
the
rules
of
practice
adopted
by
this
court
from
time
to
time
for
itself
and
for
the
district
courts
have
to
do
with
an
entirely
different
set
of
proceedings
and
entirely
different
set
of
standards
are
involved
under
those
circumstances.
there
are
many,
many
cases
of
course
that
are
filed
in
federal
courts
everyday
where
jurisdictional
amount
is
not
involved,
fair
labor
standard
cases,
i
think
some
cases
under
the
securities
act,
civil
rights
cases
and
others.
and
under
those
circumstances
the
district
courts
need
not
be
bothered
with
the
$10,000.00
jurisdictional
amount
as
they
are
in
ordinary
diversity
and
in
ordinary
federal
question
cases.
and
in
those
cases
i
trust
as
well
as
in
the
diversity
cases
and
the
federal
question
cases.
the
amendments
to
rule
23
will
make
class
actions
easier
to
handle,
easier
process,
easier
to
understand
the
results
but
simply
because
we
now
have
before
us
an
attempt
to
improve
upon
formal
rule
23,
it
seems
to
me
it
has
nothing
whatsoever
to
do
with
that
preexisting
body
of
law
which
deals
with
jurisdiction
which
has
developed
two
decisions
of
this
court
since
1789
and
which
has
always
been
a
problem
or
a
matter
than
any
complainant
in
federal
court
must
meet
regardless
of
what
the
rules
and
practice
are
which
have
prevailed
in
that
court
from
time
to
time.
i
would
call
the
court's
attention,
the
opinion
of
mr.
justice
story
in
the
alexander
case
which
was
well
over
a
hundred
years
old
so
far
as
i
know,
that's
one
of
the
first
cases
dealing
with
the
jurisdictional
questions
in
the
matter
of
aggregation
and
the
court
pointed
out
in
that
case
and
although
congress
had
authorized
seaman
to
bring
in
effect
class
actions
or
joint
suits
for
unpaid
wages
in
the
federal
district
courts
that
because
this
court
at
that
time
had
an
appellate
jurisdictional
limit
of
$500.00
as
the
matter
in
controversy
or
the
amount
in
controversy,
therefore
there
was
no
appellate
jurisdiction
of
any
seaman's
wages
when
those
wages
did
not
amount
to
an
excess
of
$500.00
and
so
far
as
i
know,
there
has
been
an
unbroken
string
of
decisions
following
that
case
and
applying
it
both
to
the
appellate
jurisdiction
of
this
court
and
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
court.
that
district
court
--
mr.
gerrit
h.
wormhoudt
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
gerrit
h.
wormhoudt
that
is
correct.
it
seems
to
me
the
principle
is
identical
however.
mr.
gerrit
h.
wormhoudt
no
your
honor,
it
did
not.
mr.
gerrit
h.
wormhoudt
that's
correct.
i
would
point
out
that
there
are
numerous
situations
where
a
class
action
was
appropriate
under
the
old
rules
and
will
be
--
just
as
appropriate
if
not
more
appropriate
under
the
new
rules.
i
do
think
it
maybe
some
help
in
analyzing
the
question
to
really
ask
what
we
mean
when
we
use
the
term
aggregation,
i
think
it
was
judge
frankel
in
an
article
mentioned
in
our
brief
who
suggested
the
term
aggregation
has
probably
been
a
complete
misnomer
from
the
beginning
and
his
analysis
may
have
some
bearing
upon
the
question
put
by
mr.
justice
fortas
earlier
since
as
he
points
out
in
a
traditional
class
action
where
the
claim
is
common
or
undivided
or
joined.
in
effect
you
have
but
a
single
claim
and
while
numerous
people
may
be
interested
in,
claims
are
not
being
aggregated
where
the
claim
itself
joined
or
common
or
undivided.
and
in
those
cases
where
the
total
claim
itself
passing
the
derivative
suit
is
in
excess
to
$10,000.00.
there
really
is
not
an
aggregation
or
a
joinder
of
claims
and
the
jurisdictional
problem
simply
doesn't
exist.
mr.
gerrit
h.
wormhoudt
is
he
bringing
this
on
behalf
of
the
stockholders
or
the
corporation
your
honor
or
he
himself
has
a
claim
in
excess
of
the
jurisdictional
amount?
i
do
not
know
of
any
decisions
of
this
court
which
say
that
under
those
circumstances,
he
could
then
if
this
were
simply
a
joinder
device
include
all
the
other
members
of
the
class
unless
their
claims
also
exceeded.
yes?
mr.
gerrit
h.
wormhoudt
i
think
in
clark
against
paul
gray
and
i'm
sorry
i'm
not
more
conversant
with
that
case
for
this
court
on
its
own
motion
to
dismiss
several
claims.
as
i
recall,
the
plaintiff
in
that
case
had
the
requisite
jurisdictional
amount
and
this
court
directed
however
that
the
other
parties
to
the
action
be
dismissed
from
the
suit.
this
is
my
recollection
--
mr.
gerrit
h.
wormhoudt
no,
your
honor
i
don't.
mr.
gerrit
h.
wormhoudt
i
think
it's
conceivable
than
any
of
them
would.
i
would
point
out
that
neither
the
district
court
nor
the
appellate
court
characterizes
this
as
a
(b)
(1),
(b)
(2)
or
(b)
(3)
class
action.
mr.
gerrit
h.
wormhoudt
yes
mr.
justice,
i'm
confident
that
the
court
would
--
mr.
gerrit
h.
wormhoudt
yes
sir.
and
i
assume
that
several
decrees
would
have
to
be
entered
in
each
case
or
i
mean
as
to
each
party
defining
the
exact
amount
that
he
had
assuming
that
he
paid
his
cash
--
gas
bill
at
the
time
and
there
were
aren't
any
set
offset.
mr.
gerrit
h.
wormhoudt
not
your
honor
in
diversity
suits.
i
submit
it
was
not.
i
think
the
main
thrust
of
my
argument
would
be
along
these
lines.
rule
82
says
the
rule
shall
not
be
construed
to
extend
or
limit
jurisdiction.
mr.
gerrit
h.
wormhoudt
no
your
honor,
mr.
justice.
i
think
it
may
be
a
proper
class
action
as
a
class
action
was
now
defined,
i
simply
submit
that
doesn't
tell
you
whether
or
not
you
have
jurisdiction.
mr.
gerrit
h.
wormhoudt
i
think
it
depends
not
on
the
total
amount
of
the
aggregate
judgment
but
on
the
nature
of
the
claim
of
the
plaintiff
himself
and
of
the
claim
of
the
class.
i
would
merely
like
to
refer
very
briefly
to
rule
82
which
says
that
the
rules
in
this
rule
was
also
amended
in
1966
shall
not
be
construed
to
enlarge
or
diminish
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts.
the
circuit
court
conceded
in
its
opinion
and
i
think
counsel
will
concede
here.
this
action
simply
was
not
maintainable
prior
to
the
amendment
of
the
rule
that
being
so
although
i
may
be
supposedly
geared
to
errors
that
dealing
in
logic
if
the
action
could
not
have
been
maintained
for
jurisdictional
reasons
prior
to
the
amendment
of
the
rule
but
it
may
now
be
maintained
because
of
the
amendment
of
the
rule
then
it
seems
to
me
that
is
only
because
of
a
construction
which
does
enlarge
a
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
district
courts.
thank
you.
mr.
gerrit
h.
wormhoudt
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
gerrit
h.
wormhoudt
at
the
close
of
argument
yesterday,
i
was
trying
to
establish
that
there
has
been
an
existence
long
before
the
enactment
of
the
federal
rules,
a
body
of
law
derived
from
the
acts
of
congress
and
interpreting
decisions
of
this
court
which
are
applicable
to
the
jurisdictional
requirements
for
federal
courts,
that
body
of
law
being
independent
of
and
indeed
i
think
superior
to
the
rules
of
practice
that
this
court
may
promulgate
from
time
to
time.
because
of
that
body
of
law
i
think
we
have
rule
82
of
the
present
federal
rule.
rule
82
provided
initially
that
none
of
the
rules
would
be
interpreted
to
extend
or
limit
the
jurisdiction
of
federal
court
when
the
1966
amendments
were
adopted.
rule
82
was
restated
making
reference
to
admiralty
but
continuing
the
restrictive
language
i’ve
just
mentioned.
i
submit
that
rule
82
is
there
simply
as
a
guide
to
construction
and
an
admonition
that
in
interpreting
the
rules
they
simply
shall
not
affect
the
jurisdictional
standards
of
the
lower
federal
courts.
i
would
now
direct
the
court’s
attention
to
the
nature
of
the
particular
claims
involved
in
this
action.
i
think
i
mentioned
yesterday
that
neither
the
district
court
nor
the
court
of
appeals
attempted
to
categorize
the
claims
involved
in
this
action
as
(b)
(1),
(b)
(2)
or
(b)
(3)
claims.
i
don’t
think
there
can
be
any
question
however
that
if
this
is
a
proper
class
action,
it
must
fall
within
the
terms
of
rule
--
of
subdivision
(b)
(3)
of
amended
rule
23
which
refers
in
substance
to
cases
presenting
common
questions
of
law
or
fact
where
the
predominating
common
question
would
take
precedents
over
any
separate
questions
arising
out
of
the
claims.
mr.
gerrit
h.
wormhoudt
i
do
not
sir.
mr.
gerrit
h.
wormhoudt
i’m
merely
trying
to
--
mr.
gerrit
h.
wormhoudt
categorize
it
under
the
rules.
mr.
gerrit
h.
wormhoudt
i
think
in
respondents
brief,
references
made
to
the
fact
that
prior
to
the
amendment
cases
such
as
we
have
here
today
involving
separate
and
distinct
claims
really
amounted
under
the
prior
rule
to
a
permissive
joinder
en
masse
so
to
speak
under
prior
rule
23.
that
being
the
case,
i
do
think
then
we
must
consider
as
mr.
justice
white
was
suggesting
yesterday
the
logic
of
applying
or
abandoning
the
aggregation
doctrine
under
(b)
(3)
cases
to
the
other
rules
which
deal
likewise
with
permissive
joinder
and
subdivision
(b)
(3)
certainly
presents
an
instance
of
permissive
joinder
provided
by
its
own
terms
that
any
pardon
may
opt
out
upon
recieve
of
notice
that
he
has
been
included
in
a
class
which
is
in
litigation
before
the
court.
so,
consequently
we
still
have
the
permissive
feature
involved
in
at
least
rule
23
(b)
(3)
cases.
mr.
gerrit
h.
wormhoudt
well,
if
your
honor
please,
at
least
under
the
laws
of
kansas,
merely
all
stockholder
cases
would
have
to
be
filed
as
derivative
suits.
there
may
be
special
instances
and
departures
from
the
derivative
rule
but
normally
that
stockholder's
actions
present
but
a
single
action
on
behalf
of
the
corporation.
consequently,
there
would
not
be
a
joinder
problem
under
the
situation
you
put.
perhaps
there
may
be
another
state
jurisdiction
if
so,
i'm
not
familiar
with
the
problem
that
would
be
present.
mr.
gerrit
h.
wormhoudt
i
don't
think
there
has
ever
been
any
question
about
that.
mr.
gerrit
h.
wormhoudt
that
is
correct.
mr.
gerrit
h.
wormhoudt
and
it
seems
to
me
also
on
those
lines
that
if
aggregation
has
not
been
permitted
under
rule
19
in
an
ordinary
permissive
joinder
case
where
all
the
parties
are
before
the
court
they're
identifiable
and
certainly
res
judicata
would
apply
to
any
matters
litigated
where
the
parties
were
named
that
in
a
situation
where
all
the
parties
may
not
actually
be
before
the
court,
there
is
even
less
reason
to
aggregate
their
claims
in
order
to
satisfy
jurisdictional
amount
then
there
would
be
in
an
ordinary
permissive
joinder
situation.
mr.
gerrit
h.
wormhoudt
yes,
because
i
think
the
same
principles
involved
in
those
situations,
they
are
all
bounded.
mr.
gerrit
h.
wormhoudt
are
you
as
--
may
i
ask
if
you
are
assuming
that
the
subsequent
suit
is
filed
by
a
person
who
was
a
named
party
in
the
original
action?
mr.
gerrit
h.
wormhoudt
i
understand
and
i'm
also
--
mr.
gerrit
h.
wormhoudt
now
we
also
assume
that
he
did
not
upheld
on
the
receipt
of
notice
that
the
suit
had
been
filed.
mr.
gerrit
h.
wormhoudt
yes.
mr.
gerrit
h.
wormhoudt
not
on
the
facts
of
this
case.
mr.
gerrit
h.
wormhoudt
i
might
suggest
it's
a
permissive
misjoinder
case
then
where
you
have
the
option
to
take
yourself
out.
on
the
facts
you
put
mr.
justice
--
mr.
gerrit
h.
wormhoudt
i
think
in
this
traditional
sense,
i
would
have
to
disagree
that
this
is
not
a
true
class
action.
these
claims
are
separate
and
distinct
and
traditionally
at
least
under
those
circumstances
any
member
of
the
class
would
have
had
perfect
freedom
prior
to
the
enactment
of
this
rule
to
litigate
where
he
pleases,
when
he
pleases
by
--
mr.
gerrit
h.
wormhoudt
that
is
correct.
mr.
gerrit
h.
wormhoudt
oh,
i
think
within
the
terms
of
the
rule,
i
have
no
disagreement.
mr.
gerrit
h.
wormhoudt
i
think
this
is
correct.
mr.
gerrit
h.
wormhoudt
i
think
that
is
the
question
and
again
i
maybe
repetitious
but
i
would
still
take
the
position
that
you
must
consider
the
nature
of
the
claims
involved
in
order
to
test
jurisdiction.
mr.
gerrit
h.
wormhoudt
yes,
sir.
mr.
gerrit
h.
wormhoudt
your
honor,
if
i
were
--
mr.
gerrit
h.
wormhoudt
i
think
a
good
example
would
be
a
trustee
situation
under
trust
indenture.
mr.
gerrit
h.
wormhoudt
assuming
that
the
trustee
would
somehow
rather
derelict
in
his
duties
with
respect
to
the
preservation
of
the
trust
property.
i
would
think
then
that
any
beneficiary
of
the
trust
would
have
the
right
on
behalf
of
all
other
members
who
are
beneficiaries
to
attempt
to
enforce
or
employ
--
mr.
gerrit
h.
wormhoudt
yes,
there
may
be
other
categories
where
you
have
a
fund
involved
where
first
the
--
whether
maybe
undivided
interest
in
the
fund,
i
would
suggest
that
is
a
possible
certain
category,
something
in
the
nature
of
quiet
title
suits.
mr.
gerrit
h.
wormhoudt
i
think
so,
your
honor.
and
there
as
i
mention
i
don't
think
you
have
any
problem
of
aggregation
because
you
only
really
have
a
single
claim,
it
doesn't
affect
many
people
but
to
claim
single.
mr.
gerrit
h.
wormhoudt
no,
i
see
nothing
inherently
inconsistent
to
that
if
were
--
mr.
gerrit
h.
wormhoudt
that's
correct.
i
think
we
simply
have
a
policy
consideration
here
which
derives
from
congress
in
a
prior
body
of
decisions
of
this
court
which
is
namely
to
ristrict
access
to
the
lower
federal
courts
to
ease
their
case
load.
and
for
that
reason,
we
have
a
rule
of
construction
which
says
in
so
many
words
does
not
construe
these
rules
to
increase
that
case
load.
and
the
tenth
circuit
court
conceded
that
prior
to
the
amendment
of
these
rules,
this
case
simply
could
not
have
been
filed.
the
conclusion
is
that
by
virtue
of
the
amendment
now
it
can
be.
and
i
submit
that
consequently
jurisdiction
has
been
large
because
it's
now
present
where
it
wasn't
before.
and
as
a
result,
we're
going
to
have
considerably
more
litigation
in
the
federal
courts
of
the
most
complicated
kind.
and
the
kind
of
litigation
that
can
certainly
properly
be
handled
in
the
federal
court
and
i
beg
your
pardon,
in
state
courts
and
i
think
both
of
these
cases
present
good
instances
of
that.
we
have
in
this
case
a
question
of
the
legality
of
the
municipal
ordinance
involving
a
franchise
tax
collected
by
a
public
utility
which
is
subject
to
regulation
by
kansas
authorities.
there
are
just
simply
no
policy
reasons
apparent
apart
from
the
so-called
desirability
or
workability
of
the
rules
which
override
i
submit
the
congressional
policy
of
easing
the
work
load
on
our
lower
federal
courts.
i
think
at
least
in
my
district,
we
can
get
a
case
disposed
of
in
half
the
time
in
federal
court,
i
beg
your
pardon
again,
in
our
state
courts.
thank
you.
mr.
gerrit
h.
wormhoudt
yes
in
kansas
we
have
the
former
--
equivalent
of
the
former
rule
23.
mr.
gerrit
h.
wormhoudt
no,
the
entire
former
rule
23
which
included
--
mr.
gerrit
h.
wormhoudt
that
is
correct.
mr.
gerrit
h.
wormhoudt
insofar
as
i
know
there
is
no
consideration
of
being
--
mr.
gerrit
h.
wormhoudt
amended
as
a
present
time.
thank
you.
mr.
gerrit
h.
wormhoudt
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
action
was
commenced
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
court
of
kansas
also
as
a
class
suit
under
the
newly
amended
rule
23
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure.
the
plaintiff
brings
the
action
on
behalf
of
themselves
an
18,000
other
consumers
of
natural
gas
at
retail
upon
the
petitioner
in
this
case
who
was
a
public
utility
in
missouri
corporation
qualified
to
do
business
in
kansas.
the
petitioner
claims
that
or
complains
that
the
--
i
beg
your
pardon,
the
respondent
claims
that
the
petitioner
in
this
case
illegally
exacted
from
the
plaintiff
and
from
the
members
of
the
class
which
the
plaintiff
seeks
to
represent
and
illegally
imposed
franchise
charged
exacted
by
the
city
of
arkansas
city
in
cowley
county
kansas
that
this
charge
was
not
maintainable
beyond
the
city
limits
that
the
respondent
in
this
case
resides
beyond
the
city
limits
along
with
18,000
other
members
of
his
class.
diversity
did
exist,
jurisdictional
amount
was
pleaded.
the
petitioner
then
moved
in
the
district
court
to
dismiss
the
action,
the
motion
to
dismiss
was
supported
by
an
affidavit
indicating
that
during
a
probable
time
period
involved
here,
this
particular
respondent's
claim
would
have
amounted
to
$7.81.
during
the
course
of
argument,
counsel
for
the
respondent
frankly
stipulated
that
the
respondent's
claim
could
not
equal
$10,000.00
and
that
they
had
no
knowledge
of
any
other
member
of
the
class
whose
claim
would
equal
or
exceed
$10,000.00.
the
district
court
however
overruled
the
motion
to
dismiss.
it
did
in
its
order
make
the
necessary
determination
and
findings
permitting
petitioner
to
apply
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit
for
an
interlocutory
appeal,
that
application
was
granted
and
the
tenth
circuit
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
order
of
the
district
court
at
approximately
the
same
time
within
a
month
or
two
of
the
affirmation
of
the
district
court's
ruling
in
snyder
versus
harris.
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to
what
i
think
have
been
straw
men
raised
in
the
brief
of
the
respondent.
it
has
been
suggested
that
the
petitioner
in
this
case
is
seeking
to
confine
the
construction
of
the
amendments
to
the
rules
to
the
language
of
the
formal
rule
alleged
rule
23
and
the
horrible
parade
of
norman
clayture
that
developed
under
that
rule,
it
references
to
two
class
actions,
hybrid
class
actions,
and
superior
class
actions.
i
think
it
is
perfectly
abundant,
perfectly
clear
that
the
real
problem
involved
here
is
not
one
of
the
construction
of
prior
rule
23.
so
far
as
we're
concerned,
that
rule
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
present
action.
we
don't
rely
on
it.
we
find
it
unnecessary
to
refer
to
it.
we
do
think
that
jurisdictional
standards
first
as
adopted
by
congress
and
the
body
of
case
law
which
has
developed
around
those
jurisdictional
standards
is
one
set
of
rules
and
one
body
of
law.
the
rules
of
practice
adopted
by
this
court
from
time
to
time
for
itself
and
for
the
district
courts
have
to
do
with
an
entirely
different
set
of
proceedings
and
entirely
different
set
of
standards
are
involved
under
those
circumstances.
there
are
many,
many
cases
of
course
that
are
filed
in
federal
courts
everyday
where
jurisdictional
amount
is
not
involved,
fair
labor
standard
cases,
i
think
some
cases
under
the
securities
act,
civil
rights
cases
and
others.
and
under
those
circumstances
the
district
courts
need
not
be
bothered
with
the
$10,000.00
jurisdictional
amount
as
they
are
in
ordinary
diversity
and
in
ordinary
federal
question
cases.
and
in
those
cases
i
trust
as
well
as
in
the
diversity
cases
and
the
federal
question
cases.
the
amendments
to
rule
23
will
make
class
actions
easier
to
handle,
easier
process,
easier
to
understand
the
results
but
simply
because
we
now
have
before
us
an
attempt
to
improve
upon
formal
rule
23,
it
seems
to
me
it
has
nothing
whatsoever
to
do
with
that
preexisting
body
of
law
which
deals
with
jurisdiction
which
has
developed
two
decisions
of
this
court
since
1789
and
which
has
always
been
a
problem
or
a
matter
than
any
complainant
in
federal
court
must
meet
regardless
of
what
the
rules
and
practice
are
which
have
prevailed
in
that
court
from
time
to
time.
i
would
call
the
court's
attention,
the
opinion
of
mr.
justice
story
in
the
alexander
case
which
was
well
over
a
hundred
years
old
so
far
as
i
know,
that's
one
of
the
first
cases
dealing
with
the
jurisdictional
questions
in
the
matter
of
aggregation
and
the
court
pointed
out
in
that
case
and
although
congress
had
authorized
seaman
to
bring
in
effect
class
actions
or
joint
suits
for
unpaid
wages
in
the
federal
district
courts
that
because
this
court
at
that
time
had
an
appellate
jurisdictional
limit
of
$500.00
as
the
matter
in
controversy
or
the
amount
in
controversy,
therefore
there
was
no
appellate
jurisdiction
of
any
seaman's
wages
when
those
wages
did
not
amount
to
an
excess
of
$500.00
and
so
far
as
i
know,
there
has
been
an
unbroken
string
of
decisions
following
that
case
and
applying
it
both
to
the
appellate
jurisdiction
of
this
court
and
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
court.
that
district
court
--
mr.
gerrit
h.
wormhoudt
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
gerrit
h.
wormhoudt
that
is
correct.
it
seems
to
me
the
principle
is
identical
however.
mr.
gerrit
h.
wormhoudt
no
your
honor,
it
did
not.
mr.
gerrit
h.
wormhoudt
that's
correct.
i
would
point
out
that
there
are
numerous
situations
where
a
class
action
was
appropriate
under
the
old
rules
and
will
be
--
just
as
appropriate
if
not
more
appropriate
under
the
new
rules.
i
do
think
it
maybe
some
help
in
analyzing
the
question
to
really
ask
what
we
mean
when
we
use
the
term
aggregation,
i
think
it
was
judge
frankel
in
an
article
mentioned
in
our
brief
who
suggested
the
term
aggregation
has
probably
been
a
complete
misnomer
from
the
beginning
and
his
analysis
may
have
some
bearing
upon
the
question
put
by
mr.
justice
fortas
earlier
since
as
he
points
out
in
a
traditional
class
action
where
the
claim
is
common
or
undivided
or
joined.
in
effect
you
have
but
a
single
claim
and
while
numerous
people
may
be
interested
in,
claims
are
not
being
aggregated
where
the
claim
itself
joined
or
common
or
undivided.
and
in
those
cases
where
the
total
claim
itself
passing
the
derivative
suit
is
in
excess
to
$10,000.00.
there
really
is
not
an
aggregation
or
a
joinder
of
claims
and
the
jurisdictional
problem
simply
doesn't
exist.
mr.
gerrit
h.
wormhoudt
is
he
bringing
this
on
behalf
of
the
stockholders
or
the
corporation
your
honor
or
he
himself
has
a
claim
in
excess
of
the
jurisdictional
amount?
i
do
not
know
of
any
decisions
of
this
court
which
say
that
under
those
circumstances,
he
could
then
if
this
were
simply
a
joinder
device
include
all
the
other
members
of
the
class
unless
their
claims
also
exceeded.
yes?
mr.
gerrit
h.
wormhoudt
i
think
in
clark
against
paul
gray
and
i'm
sorry
i'm
not
more
conversant
with
that
case
for
this
court
on
its
own
motion
to
dismiss
several
claims.
as
i
recall,
the
plaintiff
in
that
case
had
the
requisite
jurisdictional
amount
and
this
court
directed
however
that
the
other
parties
to
the
action
be
dismissed
from
the
suit.
this
is
my
recollection
--
mr.
gerrit
h.
wormhoudt
no,
your
honor
i
don't.
mr.
gerrit
h.
wormhoudt
i
think
it's
conceivable
than
any
of
them
would.
i
would
point
out
that
neither
the
district
court
nor
the
appellate
court
characterizes
this
as
a
(b)
(1),
(b)
(2)
or
(b)
(3)
class
action.
mr.
gerrit
h.
wormhoudt
yes
mr.
justice,
i'm
confident
that
the
court
would
--
mr.
gerrit
h.
wormhoudt
yes
sir.
and
i
assume
that
several
decrees
would
have
to
be
entered
in
each
case
or
i
mean
as
to
each
party
defining
the
exact
amount
that
he
had
assuming
that
he
paid
his
cash
--
gas
bill
at
the
time
and
there
were
aren't
any
set
offset.
mr.
gerrit
h.
wormhoudt
not
your
honor
in
diversity
suits.
i
submit
it
was
not.
i
think
the
main
thrust
of
my
argument
would
be
along
these
lines.
rule
82
says
the
rule
shall
not
be
construed
to
extend
or
limit
jurisdiction.
mr.
gerrit
h.
wormhoudt
no
your
honor,
mr.
justice.
i
think
it
may
be
a
proper
class
action
as
a
class
action
was
now
defined,
i
simply
submit
that
doesn't
tell
you
whether
or
not
you
have
jurisdiction.
mr.
gerrit
h.
wormhoudt
i
think
it
depends
not
on
the
total
amount
of
the
aggregate
judgment
but
on
the
nature
of
the
claim
of
the
plaintiff
himself
and
of
the
claim
of
the
class.
i
would
merely
like
to
refer
very
briefly
to
rule
82
which
says
that
the
rules
in
this
rule
was
also
amended
in
1966
shall
not
be
construed
to
enlarge
or
diminish
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts.
the
circuit
court
conceded
in
its
opinion
and
i
think
counsel
will
concede
here.
this
action
simply
was
not
maintainable
prior
to
the
amendment
of
the
rule
that
being
so
although
i
may
be
supposedly
geared
to
errors
that
dealing
in
logic
if
the
action
could
not
have
been
maintained
for
jurisdictional
reasons
prior
to
the
amendment
of
the
rule
but
it
may
now
be
maintained
because
of
the
amendment
of
the
rule
then
it
seems
to
me
that
is
only
because
of
a
construction
which
does
enlarge
a
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
district
courts.
thank
you.
mr.
gerrit
h.
wormhoudt
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
gerrit
h.
wormhoudt
at
the
close
of
argument
yesterday,
i
was
trying
to
establish
that
there
has
been
an
existence
long
before
the
enactment
of
the
federal
rules,
a
body
of
law
derived
from
the
acts
of
congress
and
interpreting
decisions
of
this
court
which
are
applicable
to
the
jurisdictional
requirements
for
federal
courts,
that
body
of
law
being
independent
of
and
indeed
i
think
superior
to
the
rules
of
practice
that
this
court
may
promulgate
from
time
to
time.
because
of
that
body
of
law
i
think
we
have
rule
82
of
the
present
federal
rule.
rule
82
provided
initially
that
none
of
the
rules
would
be
interpreted
to
extend
or
limit
the
jurisdiction
of
federal
court
when
the
1966
amendments
were
adopted.
rule
82
was
restated
making
reference
to
admiralty
but
continuing
the
restrictive
language
i’ve
just
mentioned.
i
submit
that
rule
82
is
there
simply
as
a
guide
to
construction
and
an
admonition
that
in
interpreting
the
rules
they
simply
shall
not
affect
the
jurisdictional
standards
of
the
lower
federal
courts.
i
would
now
direct
the
court’s
attention
to
the
nature
of
the
particular
claims
involved
in
this
action.
i
think
i
mentioned
yesterday
that
neither
the
district
court
nor
the
court
of
appeals
attempted
to
categorize
the
claims
involved
in
this
action
as
(b)
(1),
(b)
(2)
or
(b)
(3)
claims.
i
don’t
think
there
can
be
any
question
however
that
if
this
is
a
proper
class
action,
it
must
fall
within
the
terms
of
rule
--
of
subdivision
(b)
(3)
of
amended
rule
23
which
refers
in
substance
to
cases
presenting
common
questions
of
law
or
fact
where
the
predominating
common
question
would
take
precedents
over
any
separate
questions
arising
out
of
the
claims.
mr.
gerrit
h.
wormhoudt
i
do
not
sir.
mr.
gerrit
h.
wormhoudt
i’m
merely
trying
to
--
mr.
gerrit
h.
wormhoudt
categorize
it
under
the
rules.
mr.
gerrit
h.
wormhoudt
i
think
in
respondents
brief,
references
made
to
the
fact
that
prior
to
the
amendment
cases
such
as
we
have
here
today
involving
separate
and
distinct
claims
really
amounted
under
the
prior
rule
to
a
permissive
joinder
en
masse
so
to
speak
under
prior
rule
23.
that
being
the
case,
i
do
think
then
we
must
consider
as
mr.
justice
white
was
suggesting
yesterday
the
logic
of
applying
or
abandoning
the
aggregation
doctrine
under
(b)
(3)
cases
to
the
other
rules
which
deal
likewise
with
permissive
joinder
and
subdivision
(b)
(3)
certainly
presents
an
instance
of
permissive
joinder
provided
by
its
own
terms
that
any
pardon
may
opt
out
upon
recieve
of
notice
that
he
has
been
included
in
a
class
which
is
in
litigation
before
the
court.
so,
consequently
we
still
have
the
permissive
feature
involved
in
at
least
rule
23
(b)
(3)
cases.
mr.
gerrit
h.
wormhoudt
well,
if
your
honor
please,
at
least
under
the
laws
of
kansas,
merely
all
stockholder
cases
would
have
to
be
filed
as
derivative
suits.
there
may
be
special
instances
and
departures
from
the
derivative
rule
but
normally
that
stockholder's
actions
present
but
a
single
action
on
behalf
of
the
corporation.
consequently,
there
would
not
be
a
joinder
problem
under
the
situation
you
put.
perhaps
there
may
be
another
state
jurisdiction
if
so,
i'm
not
familiar
with
the
problem
that
would
be
present.
mr.
gerrit
h.
wormhoudt
i
don't
think
there
has
ever
been
any
question
about
that.
mr.
gerrit
h.
wormhoudt
that
is
correct.
mr.
gerrit
h.
wormhoudt
and
it
seems
to
me
also
on
those
lines
that
if
aggregation
has
not
been
permitted
under
rule
19
in
an
ordinary
permissive
joinder
case
where
all
the
parties
are
before
the
court
they're
identifiable
and
certainly
res
judicata
would
apply
to
any
matters
litigated
where
the
parties
were
named
that
in
a
situation
where
all
the
parties
may
not
actually
be
before
the
court,
there
is
even
less
reason
to
aggregate
their
claims
in
order
to
satisfy
jurisdictional
amount
then
there
would
be
in
an
ordinary
permissive
joinder
situation.
mr.
gerrit
h.
wormhoudt
yes,
because
i
think
the
same
principles
involved
in
those
situations,
they
are
all
bounded.
mr.
gerrit
h.
wormhoudt
are
you
as
--
may
i
ask
if
you
are
assuming
that
the
subsequent
suit
is
filed
by
a
person
who
was
a
named
party
in
the
original
action?
mr.
gerrit
h.
wormhoudt
i
understand
and
i'm
also
--
mr.
gerrit
h.
wormhoudt
now
we
also
assume
that
he
did
not
upheld
on
the
receipt
of
notice
that
the
suit
had
been
filed.
mr.
gerrit
h.
wormhoudt
yes.
mr.
gerrit
h.
wormhoudt
not
on
the
facts
of
this
case.
mr.
gerrit
h.
wormhoudt
i
might
suggest
it's
a
permissive
misjoinder
case
then
where
you
have
the
option
to
take
yourself
out.
on
the
facts
you
put
mr.
justice
--
mr.
gerrit
h.
wormhoudt
i
think
in
this
traditional
sense,
i
would
have
to
disagree
that
this
is
not
a
true
class
action.
these
claims
are
separate
and
distinct
and
traditionally
at
least
under
those
circumstances
any
member
of
the
class
would
have
had
perfect
freedom
prior
to
the
enactment
of
this
rule
to
litigate
where
he
pleases,
when
he
pleases
by
--
mr.
gerrit
h.
wormhoudt
that
is
correct.
mr.
gerrit
h.
wormhoudt
oh,
i
think
within
the
terms
of
the
rule,
i
have
no
disagreement.
mr.
gerrit
h.
wormhoudt
i
think
this
is
correct.
mr.
gerrit
h.
wormhoudt
i
think
that
is
the
question
and
again
i
maybe
repetitious
but
i
would
still
take
the
position
that
you
must
consider
the
nature
of
the
claims
involved
in
order
to
test
jurisdiction.
mr.
gerrit
h.
wormhoudt
yes,
sir.
mr.
gerrit
h.
wormhoudt
your
honor,
if
i
were
--
mr.
gerrit
h.
wormhoudt
i
think
a
good
example
would
be
a
trustee
situation
under
trust
indenture.
mr.
gerrit
h.
wormhoudt
assuming
that
the
trustee
would
somehow
rather
derelict
in
his
duties
with
respect
to
the
preservation
of
the
trust
property.
i
would
think
then
that
any
beneficiary
of
the
trust
would
have
the
right
on
behalf
of
all
other
members
who
are
beneficiaries
to
attempt
to
enforce
or
employ
--
mr.
gerrit
h.
wormhoudt
yes,
there
may
be
other
categories
where
you
have
a
fund
involved
where
first
the
--
whether
maybe
undivided
interest
in
the
fund,
i
would
suggest
that
is
a
possible
certain
category,
something
in
the
nature
of
quiet
title
suits.
mr.
gerrit
h.
wormhoudt
i
think
so,
your
honor.
and
there
as
i
mention
i
don't
think
you
have
any
problem
of
aggregation
because
you
only
really
have
a
single
claim,
it
doesn't
affect
many
people
but
to
claim
single.
mr.
gerrit
h.
wormhoudt
no,
i
see
nothing
inherently
inconsistent
to
that
if
were
--
mr.
gerrit
h.
wormhoudt
that's
correct.
i
think
we
simply
have
a
policy
consideration
here
which
derives
from
congress
in
a
prior
body
of
decisions
of
this
court
which
is
namely
to
ristrict
access
to
the
lower
federal
courts
to
ease
their
case
load.
and
for
that
reason,
we
have
a
rule
of
construction
which
says
in
so
many
words
does
not
construe
these
rules
to
increase
that
case
load.
and
the
tenth
circuit
court
conceded
that
prior
to
the
amendment
of
these
rules,
this
case
simply
could
not
have
been
filed.
the
conclusion
is
that
by
virtue
of
the
amendment
now
it
can
be.
and
i
submit
that
consequently
jurisdiction
has
been
large
because
it's
now
present
where
it
wasn't
before.
and
as
a
result,
we're
going
to
have
considerably
more
litigation
in
the
federal
courts
of
the
most
complicated
kind.
and
the
kind
of
litigation
that
can
certainly
properly
be
handled
in
the
federal
court
and
i
beg
your
pardon,
in
state
courts
and
i
think
both
of
these
cases
present
good
instances
of
that.
we
have
in
this
case
a
question
of
the
legality
of
the
municipal
ordinance
involving
a
franchise
tax
collected
by
a
public
utility
which
is
subject
to
regulation
by
kansas
authorities.
there
are
just
simply
no
policy
reasons
apparent
apart
from
the
so-called
desirability
or
workability
of
the
rules
which
override
i
submit
the
congressional
policy
of
easing
the
work
load
on
our
lower
federal
courts.
i
think
at
least
in
my
district,
we
can
get
a
case
disposed
of
in
half
the
time
in
federal
court,
i
beg
your
pardon
again,
in
our
state
courts.
thank
you.
mr.
gerrit
h.
wormhoudt
yes
in
kansas
we
have
the
former
--
equivalent
of
the
former
rule
23.
mr.
gerrit
h.
wormhoudt
no,
the
entire
former
rule
23
which
included
--
mr.
gerrit
h.
wormhoudt
that
is
correct.
mr.
gerrit
h.
wormhoudt
insofar
as
i
know
there
is
no
consideration
of
being
--
mr.
gerrit
h.
wormhoudt
amended
as
a
present
time.
thank
you.
