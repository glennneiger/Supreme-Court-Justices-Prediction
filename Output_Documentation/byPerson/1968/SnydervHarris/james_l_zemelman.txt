mr.
james
l.
zemelman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
first
direct
the
court's
attention
to
one
particular
position
that
we've
adopted
in
our
prosecution
of
this
matter.
that
is
and
i'll
start
out
with
that
that
the
history
of
the
aggregation
doctrine
leads
us
as
the
respondents
to
the
inescapable
conclusion
that
the
doctrine,
that's
the
aggregation
doctrine
is
not
tied
to
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure.
the
aggregation
doctrine
began
approximately
a
hundred
years
prior
to
the
time
that
our
federal
rules
were
enacted.
the
jurisdiction
of
our
lower
courts
was
established
by
the
legislature
and
from
time
to
time
modified
and
amended
until
such
times
it
reached
the
$10,000.00
limitation
that
it
presently
has.
admittedly
when
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
were
amended,
there
was
an
effort
on
the
part
of
the
advisory
committee
to
give
it
seems
to
me
the
federal
district
courts
wider
discretion
as
to
the
type,
the
latitude
that
they
could
choose
in
applying
any
sort
of
joinder
application.
nevertheless,
it's
our
contention,
it's
been
our
contention
form
the
beginning
that
this
amendment
to
rule
23
although
it
does
a
way
with
the
designations
we
call
hybrid,
spurious
and
true
and
those
i
remind
this
court
were
creations
i
think
of
the
writers
rather
than
of
the
courts.
nevertheless,
they
have
to
be
used
today
as
some
form
of
a
guideline.
mr.
justice
white
asked
my
opponent
as
to
what
procedure
might
be
evolved
in
the
event
that
various
of
the
parties
within
a
class
should
seek
to
remove
themselves
from
that
class
and
clearly
as
we
pointed
our
in
our
brief.
the
possibility
is
that
the
final
remaining
or
remaining
parties
would
not
have
the
jurisdictional
limit.
i
think
that
the
intention
of
the
federal
rules
was
not
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
party
litigant
could
get
into
court
but
rather
what
procedure
might
be
used
to
simplify
the
approach
that
the
court
could
take
to
the
handling
of
the
various
litigation
before
it.
the
jurisdictional
limits
that
are
imposed
upon
the
courts
must
be
viewed
first
and
in
this
instance,
it's
a
$10,000.00
limitation.
the
plaintiff
in
this
case
by
the
admission
of
counsel
has
only
approximately
an
$8,000.00
claim
and
that
only
by
aggregation
could
she
have
as
a
forum
the
federal
court.
she
is
not
without
of
form,
the
missouri
rules
of
civil
procedure
as
set
out
in
our
brief
provide
the
same
or
comparable
provisions
as
did
rule
23
prior
to
its
amendment.
it
would
be
my
understanding
that
the
simple
result
of
the
amendment
to
the
rule
was
to
promulgate
a
more
practical
working
of
the
class
procedure.
it
enabled
the
court
to
determine
whether
or
not
a
matter
if
filled
within
the
class
action
procedures
and
would
be
appropriate
to
that
court.
but
prior
to
making
that
determination,
it
seems
to
me
that
this
court
or
any
court
has
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
jurisdictional
requirements
are
met.
counsel
has
suggested
that
we
might
be
talking
about
a
limiting
factor
by
invoking
rule
82.
federal
rule
82
says
and
i
quote
in
part
“that
the
jurisdiction
shall
not
be
extended
or
limited.”
i
am
not
suggesting
to
this
court
that
we're
talking
about
any
limitation.
the
limitation
is
in
existence
by
the
present
statutory
enactment
being
the
$10,000.00
limitation.
we're
suggesting
that
the
court
is
not
changing
that.
we're
merely
suggesting
that
if
petitioner's
application
were
applied
here
that
any
number
of
people
with
separate
and
distinct
claims
with
a
common
matter
of
law
in
fact
could
join
in
and
bring
a
cause
before
the
court.
in
the
federal
district
court
in
making
its
decision
in
this
matter,
it
referred
to
the
pinel
case
and
we
subsequently
called
the
court's
attention
to
troy
bank
of
troy,
indiana
versus
g.
a.
whitehead
and
in
that
case
probably
the
aggregation
doctrine
is
more
clearly
defined
than
in
any
i
have
read
and
that
points
out
that
when
two
or
more
plaintiffs
having
separate
and
distinct
demands
unite
for
convenience
and
economy
that
is
in
a
single
suit,
it
is
essential
that
the
demand
of
each
be
of
the
requisite
jurisdictional
amount.
clearly
in
this
case,
this
plaintiff
bringing
of
this
lawsuit
on
her
own
seeking
the
$8,000.00
based
upon
her
2,000
shares
does
not
have
a
forum
in
the
federal
court.
she
is
not
limited
from
a
day
in
court
but
she
is
limited
in
our
--
at
least
within
in
our
understanding
of
the
forum
of
this
court
or
of
the
federal
courts.
mr.
james
l.
zemelman
mr.
justice
fortas,
it
is
not.
this
is
a
class
action
claim
that
has
been
brought
not
under
the
derivative
proceedings
of
the
federal
court.
there
is
a
derivative
suit
that
has
been
filed
and
i
would
point
that
out
to
this
court
by
a
shareholder
in
the
state
courts
of
missouri.
in
addition,
this
particular
petitioner
has
filed
cases
in
the
district
court
in
the
state
of
california
and
in
the
district
court
of
the
state
of
wisconsin.
one
of
which
was
dismissed,
the
california
case.
the
wisconsin
case
following
the
holding
of
the
tenth
circuit
in
the
gas
service
case
and
accepting
that
proposition
determine
that
the
action
was
properly
brought
and
overruling
so
to
speak
the
decision
of
the
eighth
circuit
court
in
our
case
and
in
the
fifth
circuit
court
in
the
case
of
alvarez
versus
pan
american
life
insurance
company.
mr.
james
l.
zemelman
the
allegation
mr.
justice
fortas
is
that
certain
of
the
directors
--
mr.
james
l.
zemelman
--
who
controlled
a
large
block
of
their
stock.
mr.
james
l.
zemelman
sold
their
stock
to
other
persons.
mr.
james
l.
zemelman
at
a
premium
price
and
the
claims
--
mr.
james
l.
zemelman
it
may
be
in
this
instance
--
mr.
james
l.
zemelman
the
one
petitioner,
the
petitioner
in
our
state
courts
in
missouri
has
chosen
that
route,
the
derivative
route.
in
this
instance,
what
the
petitioner
has
chosen
to
do
is
to
recover
not
for
the
corporation
but
for
the
stockholders
themselves,
this
fund
that
they've
determined
by
multiplication
to
be
approximately
$1,200,000.00.
they're
not
seeking
this
money
for
the
corporation
which
is
the
derivative
action.
my
corporation
has
been
damaged
i
as
a
shareholder
seek
to
recover
when
new
directors
will
not
take
such
action.
mr.
james
l.
zemelman
this
would
take
some
thought
but
it
would
appear
that
if
it
was
the
corporation
that
we're
seeking
the
fund
by
it
before.
if
the
fund
was
to
be
sought
for
the
corporation
and
no
singular
stockholder,
i
think
this
is
an
important
element
and
no
singular
stockholder
was
to
realize
other
than
the
enrichment
of
the
corporation.
mr.
james
l.
zemelman
right.
in
that
situation
it
would
be
conceivable
that
if
the
amount
that
had
been
taken
away
from
the
corporation
were
a
$1,200,000.00
that
they
would
reach
the
jurisdictional
limit
but
that
is
not
the
case
here.
mr.
james
l.
zemelman
well
--
mr.
james
l.
zemelman
well,
i
am
not
certain
that
i
agree
with,
mr.
justice
fortas
that
the
same
procedure
would
be
followed
in
a
derivative
action.
i
don't
--
mr.
james
l.
zemelman
i
think
that
they
would
have
to
be
different
and
i
think
that
the
derivative
--
i
don't
--
it's
my
understanding
that
rule
23
be
that
the
procedure
is
on
(b)
(3)
that
the
--
we're
proceeding
under
here
is
a
derivative
action.
it's
a
class,
a
form
of
class
action
and
that
under
a
derivative
action,
the
amount
in
controversy
would
be
determined
by
what
the
corporation
would
be
entitled
to
rather
than
by
aggregating
the
claims
of
the
very
stock.
mr.
james
l.
zemelman
a
shareholder
with
one
share
of
stock
worth
a
market
value
of
$1.00
in
bringing
a
shareholder's
derivative
actions,
i
care
not
with
the
value
of
the
shareholder
stock
is,
it's
what
is
the
amount
of
the
claim
that
that
shareholder
is
asserting
on
behalf
of
that
corporation.
in
this
instance,
we
are
led
down
the
path
of
a
single
shareholder
seeking
a
single
recovery
for
her
self
and
by
--
mr.
james
l.
zemelman
well
she
is
--
mr.
james
l.
zemelman
that
is
what
--
no,
that
is
what
she's
doing
--
well,
she's
doing
this
under
the
class
action
procedure
here.
she
is
saying
to
this
--
to
the
federal
court
that
i
may
aggregate
my
$8,000.00
claim
with
your
$4,000.00
claim
and
your
$11,000.00
claim.
mr.
james
l.
zemelman
well
--
mr.
james
l.
zemelman
it's
my
position
that
in
this
case,
in
this
litigation
assuming
it
follows
the
merit,
the
merits
or
the
cost
that
this
--
that
the
federal
district
court
in
missouri
would
give
this
lady
an
award
of,
and
i
will
refer
to
my
--
which
i
can't
really
find,
some
$8,000.00,
a
judgment
for
$8,000.00.
mr.
james
l.
zemelman
under
rule
23
(b),
i'm
saying
that
she
has
not
the
jurisdictional
requisite
to
come
within
the
class
action.
yes.
mr.
james
l.
zemelman
this
is
a
separate
and
distinct
claim
brought
by
this
petitioner
enacting
rule
23
(b)
as
they
interpret
it
to
be
which
entitles
them
to
ask
because
of
the
cumbersome
condition
of
the
class
to
represent
the
class.
mr.
james
l.
zemelman
i'm
sorry.
mr.
james
l.
zemelman
she
may
if
she
has
$10,000.00
herself
and
she
as
i
understand
it
--
mr.
james
l.
zemelman
$10,000.01,
yes.
mr.
james
l.
zemelman
then
she
could
bring
this
action,
absolutely.
mr.
james
l.
zemelman
it
would
attach
in
the
way
that
counsel
wishes
it
to
attach
that
a
judgment
would
be
rendered
which
would
bind
the
class
excepting
for
those
members
of
the
class
that
chose
to
get
out
of
it.
mr.
james
l.
zemelman
take
the
action
as
to
be
excused
from.
mr.
james
l.
zemelman
well
they
could
ask
to
be
excused
from
the
action
and
bring
their
own
private
action.
i
don't
think
this
will
happen,
the
practicality
dictate
otherwise.
i
would
like
to
speak
to
one
additional
point,
that's
this
that
one
of
the
matters
that's
been
beleaguered
here
has
been
this
feeling
sorry
for
this
people
who
do
not
have
the
jurisdictional
requirement
to
get
in
this
court.
but
not
withstanding
that,
we
have
every
day
and
the
courts
of
this
land,
cases
where
plaintiffs
and
petitioners
have
9,800
or
$9,999.00
and
they
are
unable
to
avail
these
themselves
of
this
forum.
if
this
is
the
excuse
that's
going
to
be
used
to
allow
them
to
arrive
within
the
forum
of
the
federal
court,
then
of
course
new
learning
is
going
to
have
to
be
established
here
and
it
is
our
position
and
our
argument
that
the
entire
aggregation
doctrine
which
has
been
derived
and
from
the
many
cases
that
have
come
before
this
in
the
other
federal
courts,
will
have
to
be
waived
away
and
i
don't
believe
that
ipso
facto,
we're
going
to
take
wand
in
a
race,
all
of
these
procedures
and
again,
i
go
back
to
my
initial
claim
which
is
this
that
it's
our
contention
that
the
jurisdictional
requirements
have
to
be
met
and
then
we
look
to
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
to
determine
what
manner
of
action
may
be
brought
here
and
if
a
class
action
properly
lies
because
i
have
the
$10,000.01
then
so
be
it,
i'm
in
this
court.
otherwise,
i
am
limited
to
a
perfectly
adequate
forum
which
provides
the
same
sort
of
determination
as
the
federal
court.
i'm
not
led
to
believe
that
the
state
courts
of
missouri
are
going
to
be
arbitrary
in
reaching
a
decision
here
anymore
than
i
would
be
at
the
federal
courts
and
i
feel
that
an
adequate
result
if
the
law
so
supports,
it
can
be
achieved
by
the
petitioner
in
the
state
courts.
again,
i
allude
to
the
fact
that
based
upon
my
interpretation,
the
interpretation
of
judge
harper
in
our
district
court
and
a
reading
of
the
advisory
committee
indicates
that
this
a
procedural
working
and
that
under
the
doctrine
established
in
the
pinel
case,
under
the
doctrine
established
in
the
troy
bank
versus
whitehead
case
and
under
all
of
the
cases
that
we've
cited
in
our
brief
that
the
aggregation
doctrine
is
not
to
be
wiped
away.
it's
a
procedural
--
it's
a
doctrine
that
determines
that
is
determinative
of
the
jurisdictional
requisites
needed
to
get
into
this
court.
i
would
call
mr.
chief
justice
warren's
attention
to
a
paragraph
that
we've
referred
to
in
our
brief
which
points
out
among
other
things
that
the
increase
in
1958
of
the
jurisdictional
amount
to
$10,000.00
seemingly
has
only
had
a
slight
effect
on
the
workload
of
the
jurist
--
of
the
judiciary.
if
this
effort
on
the
part
of
petitioner
to
invoke
federal
rule
23
(b)
is
allowed
to
be
utilized
under
the
situation
that
they
claim,
then
i
can
see
that
this
court
will
be
flooded
with
just
extensive
litigation
because
all
of
those
claimants
who
have
one
cent
that
when
they
get
together
and
get
$10,000.01
together
under
a
separate
and
distinct
claim
procedure
will
have
the
forum
of
this
court
available
to
them.
this
petitioner
represent
--
recognized
the
separate
and
distinct
nature
of
its
claim
throughout
and
we
merely
urge
upon
this
court
that
the
decisions
of
the
fifth
circuit
which
this
court
--
which
applied
for
certiorari
to
this
court
and
which
is
subsequently
denied
the
decision
of
the
eight
circuit
and
of
by
the
way
some
of
the
federal
districts
of
illinois
are
very
well
reasoned
and
have
arrived
at
a
proper
result.
i
would
call
the
court's
attention
to
one
other
case.
there
are
two
cases
in
illinois
which
go
in
opposite
routes
and
it
would
be
our
position
that
the
booth
versus
general
dynamics
case
which
seems
to
permit
an
aggregation.
actually,
was
viewed
in
the
lesh
case
also
cited
in
our
brief
and
recognized
by
the
lesh
case
as
reaching
an
improper
result.
i
would
also
like
to
call
this
court's
attention
to
the
gas
service
company
case.
the
tenth
circuit
in
reaching
its
result,
it
was
at
least
was
our
determination
in
relying
on
the
gibbs
versus
buck
case
has
misconstrued
the
decision
of
that
case
but
that
in
fact
in
that
case
an
examination
shows
that
all
of
the
parties
that
were
petitioners
to
that
case
have
the
requisite
jurisdictional
amount
so
that
there
was
no
question
here
as
to
whether
aggregation
was
required.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
buck
case,
gibbs
versus
buck
case
reiterates
and
reaffirms
the
earlier
and
later
decisions
of
this
court
that
the
aggregation
doctrine
is
a
well
thought
up
and
a
well
situated
doctrine
that
should
not
be
wiped
away
and
i
would
suggest
to
this
court
that
if
the
court
feels
that
amended
rule
23
(b)
permits
this
than
what
the
court
is
doing
is
in
one
fell's
hoop
is
wiping
out
the
aggregation
doctrine
which
seems
to
us
to
be
a
very
realistic
doctrine
that
has
been
established
for
over
a
hundred
years
in
this
court.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
james
l.
zemelman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
first
direct
the
court's
attention
to
one
particular
position
that
we've
adopted
in
our
prosecution
of
this
matter.
that
is
and
i'll
start
out
with
that
that
the
history
of
the
aggregation
doctrine
leads
us
as
the
respondents
to
the
inescapable
conclusion
that
the
doctrine,
that's
the
aggregation
doctrine
is
not
tied
to
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure.
the
aggregation
doctrine
began
approximately
a
hundred
years
prior
to
the
time
that
our
federal
rules
were
enacted.
the
jurisdiction
of
our
lower
courts
was
established
by
the
legislature
and
from
time
to
time
modified
and
amended
until
such
times
it
reached
the
$10,000.00
limitation
that
it
presently
has.
admittedly
when
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
were
amended,
there
was
an
effort
on
the
part
of
the
advisory
committee
to
give
it
seems
to
me
the
federal
district
courts
wider
discretion
as
to
the
type,
the
latitude
that
they
could
choose
in
applying
any
sort
of
joinder
application.
nevertheless,
it's
our
contention,
it's
been
our
contention
form
the
beginning
that
this
amendment
to
rule
23
although
it
does
a
way
with
the
designations
we
call
hybrid,
spurious
and
true
and
those
i
remind
this
court
were
creations
i
think
of
the
writers
rather
than
of
the
courts.
nevertheless,
they
have
to
be
used
today
as
some
form
of
a
guideline.
mr.
justice
white
asked
my
opponent
as
to
what
procedure
might
be
evolved
in
the
event
that
various
of
the
parties
within
a
class
should
seek
to
remove
themselves
from
that
class
and
clearly
as
we
pointed
our
in
our
brief.
the
possibility
is
that
the
final
remaining
or
remaining
parties
would
not
have
the
jurisdictional
limit.
i
think
that
the
intention
of
the
federal
rules
was
not
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
party
litigant
could
get
into
court
but
rather
what
procedure
might
be
used
to
simplify
the
approach
that
the
court
could
take
to
the
handling
of
the
various
litigation
before
it.
the
jurisdictional
limits
that
are
imposed
upon
the
courts
must
be
viewed
first
and
in
this
instance,
it's
a
$10,000.00
limitation.
the
plaintiff
in
this
case
by
the
admission
of
counsel
has
only
approximately
an
$8,000.00
claim
and
that
only
by
aggregation
could
she
have
as
a
forum
the
federal
court.
she
is
not
without
of
form,
the
missouri
rules
of
civil
procedure
as
set
out
in
our
brief
provide
the
same
or
comparable
provisions
as
did
rule
23
prior
to
its
amendment.
it
would
be
my
understanding
that
the
simple
result
of
the
amendment
to
the
rule
was
to
promulgate
a
more
practical
working
of
the
class
procedure.
it
enabled
the
court
to
determine
whether
or
not
a
matter
if
filled
within
the
class
action
procedures
and
would
be
appropriate
to
that
court.
but
prior
to
making
that
determination,
it
seems
to
me
that
this
court
or
any
court
has
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
jurisdictional
requirements
are
met.
counsel
has
suggested
that
we
might
be
talking
about
a
limiting
factor
by
invoking
rule
82.
federal
rule
82
says
and
i
quote
in
part
“that
the
jurisdiction
shall
not
be
extended
or
limited.”
i
am
not
suggesting
to
this
court
that
we're
talking
about
any
limitation.
the
limitation
is
in
existence
by
the
present
statutory
enactment
being
the
$10,000.00
limitation.
we're
suggesting
that
the
court
is
not
changing
that.
we're
merely
suggesting
that
if
petitioner's
application
were
applied
here
that
any
number
of
people
with
separate
and
distinct
claims
with
a
common
matter
of
law
in
fact
could
join
in
and
bring
a
cause
before
the
court.
in
the
federal
district
court
in
making
its
decision
in
this
matter,
it
referred
to
the
pinel
case
and
we
subsequently
called
the
court's
attention
to
troy
bank
of
troy,
indiana
versus
g.
a.
whitehead
and
in
that
case
probably
the
aggregation
doctrine
is
more
clearly
defined
than
in
any
i
have
read
and
that
points
out
that
when
two
or
more
plaintiffs
having
separate
and
distinct
demands
unite
for
convenience
and
economy
that
is
in
a
single
suit,
it
is
essential
that
the
demand
of
each
be
of
the
requisite
jurisdictional
amount.
clearly
in
this
case,
this
plaintiff
bringing
of
this
lawsuit
on
her
own
seeking
the
$8,000.00
based
upon
her
2,000
shares
does
not
have
a
forum
in
the
federal
court.
she
is
not
limited
from
a
day
in
court
but
she
is
limited
in
our
--
at
least
within
in
our
understanding
of
the
forum
of
this
court
or
of
the
federal
courts.
mr.
james
l.
zemelman
mr.
justice
fortas,
it
is
not.
this
is
a
class
action
claim
that
has
been
brought
not
under
the
derivative
proceedings
of
the
federal
court.
there
is
a
derivative
suit
that
has
been
filed
and
i
would
point
that
out
to
this
court
by
a
shareholder
in
the
state
courts
of
missouri.
in
addition,
this
particular
petitioner
has
filed
cases
in
the
district
court
in
the
state
of
california
and
in
the
district
court
of
the
state
of
wisconsin.
one
of
which
was
dismissed,
the
california
case.
the
wisconsin
case
following
the
holding
of
the
tenth
circuit
in
the
gas
service
case
and
accepting
that
proposition
determine
that
the
action
was
properly
brought
and
overruling
so
to
speak
the
decision
of
the
eighth
circuit
court
in
our
case
and
in
the
fifth
circuit
court
in
the
case
of
alvarez
versus
pan
american
life
insurance
company.
mr.
james
l.
zemelman
the
allegation
mr.
justice
fortas
is
that
certain
of
the
directors
--
mr.
james
l.
zemelman
--
who
controlled
a
large
block
of
their
stock.
mr.
james
l.
zemelman
sold
their
stock
to
other
persons.
mr.
james
l.
zemelman
at
a
premium
price
and
the
claims
--
mr.
james
l.
zemelman
it
may
be
in
this
instance
--
mr.
james
l.
zemelman
the
one
petitioner,
the
petitioner
in
our
state
courts
in
missouri
has
chosen
that
route,
the
derivative
route.
in
this
instance,
what
the
petitioner
has
chosen
to
do
is
to
recover
not
for
the
corporation
but
for
the
stockholders
themselves,
this
fund
that
they've
determined
by
multiplication
to
be
approximately
$1,200,000.00.
they're
not
seeking
this
money
for
the
corporation
which
is
the
derivative
action.
my
corporation
has
been
damaged
i
as
a
shareholder
seek
to
recover
when
new
directors
will
not
take
such
action.
mr.
james
l.
zemelman
this
would
take
some
thought
but
it
would
appear
that
if
it
was
the
corporation
that
we're
seeking
the
fund
by
it
before.
if
the
fund
was
to
be
sought
for
the
corporation
and
no
singular
stockholder,
i
think
this
is
an
important
element
and
no
singular
stockholder
was
to
realize
other
than
the
enrichment
of
the
corporation.
mr.
james
l.
zemelman
right.
in
that
situation
it
would
be
conceivable
that
if
the
amount
that
had
been
taken
away
from
the
corporation
were
a
$1,200,000.00
that
they
would
reach
the
jurisdictional
limit
but
that
is
not
the
case
here.
mr.
james
l.
zemelman
well
--
mr.
james
l.
zemelman
well,
i
am
not
certain
that
i
agree
with,
mr.
justice
fortas
that
the
same
procedure
would
be
followed
in
a
derivative
action.
i
don't
--
mr.
james
l.
zemelman
i
think
that
they
would
have
to
be
different
and
i
think
that
the
derivative
--
i
don't
--
it's
my
understanding
that
rule
23
be
that
the
procedure
is
on
(b)
(3)
that
the
--
we're
proceeding
under
here
is
a
derivative
action.
it's
a
class,
a
form
of
class
action
and
that
under
a
derivative
action,
the
amount
in
controversy
would
be
determined
by
what
the
corporation
would
be
entitled
to
rather
than
by
aggregating
the
claims
of
the
very
stock.
mr.
james
l.
zemelman
a
shareholder
with
one
share
of
stock
worth
a
market
value
of
$1.00
in
bringing
a
shareholder's
derivative
actions,
i
care
not
with
the
value
of
the
shareholder
stock
is,
it's
what
is
the
amount
of
the
claim
that
that
shareholder
is
asserting
on
behalf
of
that
corporation.
in
this
instance,
we
are
led
down
the
path
of
a
single
shareholder
seeking
a
single
recovery
for
her
self
and
by
--
mr.
james
l.
zemelman
well
she
is
--
mr.
james
l.
zemelman
that
is
what
--
no,
that
is
what
she's
doing
--
well,
she's
doing
this
under
the
class
action
procedure
here.
she
is
saying
to
this
--
to
the
federal
court
that
i
may
aggregate
my
$8,000.00
claim
with
your
$4,000.00
claim
and
your
$11,000.00
claim.
mr.
james
l.
zemelman
well
--
mr.
james
l.
zemelman
it's
my
position
that
in
this
case,
in
this
litigation
assuming
it
follows
the
merit,
the
merits
or
the
cost
that
this
--
that
the
federal
district
court
in
missouri
would
give
this
lady
an
award
of,
and
i
will
refer
to
my
--
which
i
can't
really
find,
some
$8,000.00,
a
judgment
for
$8,000.00.
mr.
james
l.
zemelman
under
rule
23
(b),
i'm
saying
that
she
has
not
the
jurisdictional
requisite
to
come
within
the
class
action.
yes.
mr.
james
l.
zemelman
this
is
a
separate
and
distinct
claim
brought
by
this
petitioner
enacting
rule
23
(b)
as
they
interpret
it
to
be
which
entitles
them
to
ask
because
of
the
cumbersome
condition
of
the
class
to
represent
the
class.
mr.
james
l.
zemelman
i'm
sorry.
mr.
james
l.
zemelman
she
may
if
she
has
$10,000.00
herself
and
she
as
i
understand
it
--
mr.
james
l.
zemelman
$10,000.01,
yes.
mr.
james
l.
zemelman
then
she
could
bring
this
action,
absolutely.
mr.
james
l.
zemelman
it
would
attach
in
the
way
that
counsel
wishes
it
to
attach
that
a
judgment
would
be
rendered
which
would
bind
the
class
excepting
for
those
members
of
the
class
that
chose
to
get
out
of
it.
mr.
james
l.
zemelman
take
the
action
as
to
be
excused
from.
mr.
james
l.
zemelman
well
they
could
ask
to
be
excused
from
the
action
and
bring
their
own
private
action.
i
don't
think
this
will
happen,
the
practicality
dictate
otherwise.
i
would
like
to
speak
to
one
additional
point,
that's
this
that
one
of
the
matters
that's
been
beleaguered
here
has
been
this
feeling
sorry
for
this
people
who
do
not
have
the
jurisdictional
requirement
to
get
in
this
court.
but
not
withstanding
that,
we
have
every
day
and
the
courts
of
this
land,
cases
where
plaintiffs
and
petitioners
have
9,800
or
$9,999.00
and
they
are
unable
to
avail
these
themselves
of
this
forum.
if
this
is
the
excuse
that's
going
to
be
used
to
allow
them
to
arrive
within
the
forum
of
the
federal
court,
then
of
course
new
learning
is
going
to
have
to
be
established
here
and
it
is
our
position
and
our
argument
that
the
entire
aggregation
doctrine
which
has
been
derived
and
from
the
many
cases
that
have
come
before
this
in
the
other
federal
courts,
will
have
to
be
waived
away
and
i
don't
believe
that
ipso
facto,
we're
going
to
take
wand
in
a
race,
all
of
these
procedures
and
again,
i
go
back
to
my
initial
claim
which
is
this
that
it's
our
contention
that
the
jurisdictional
requirements
have
to
be
met
and
then
we
look
to
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
to
determine
what
manner
of
action
may
be
brought
here
and
if
a
class
action
properly
lies
because
i
have
the
$10,000.01
then
so
be
it,
i'm
in
this
court.
otherwise,
i
am
limited
to
a
perfectly
adequate
forum
which
provides
the
same
sort
of
determination
as
the
federal
court.
i'm
not
led
to
believe
that
the
state
courts
of
missouri
are
going
to
be
arbitrary
in
reaching
a
decision
here
anymore
than
i
would
be
at
the
federal
courts
and
i
feel
that
an
adequate
result
if
the
law
so
supports,
it
can
be
achieved
by
the
petitioner
in
the
state
courts.
again,
i
allude
to
the
fact
that
based
upon
my
interpretation,
the
interpretation
of
judge
harper
in
our
district
court
and
a
reading
of
the
advisory
committee
indicates
that
this
a
procedural
working
and
that
under
the
doctrine
established
in
the
pinel
case,
under
the
doctrine
established
in
the
troy
bank
versus
whitehead
case
and
under
all
of
the
cases
that
we've
cited
in
our
brief
that
the
aggregation
doctrine
is
not
to
be
wiped
away.
it's
a
procedural
--
it's
a
doctrine
that
determines
that
is
determinative
of
the
jurisdictional
requisites
needed
to
get
into
this
court.
i
would
call
mr.
chief
justice
warren's
attention
to
a
paragraph
that
we've
referred
to
in
our
brief
which
points
out
among
other
things
that
the
increase
in
1958
of
the
jurisdictional
amount
to
$10,000.00
seemingly
has
only
had
a
slight
effect
on
the
workload
of
the
jurist
--
of
the
judiciary.
if
this
effort
on
the
part
of
petitioner
to
invoke
federal
rule
23
(b)
is
allowed
to
be
utilized
under
the
situation
that
they
claim,
then
i
can
see
that
this
court
will
be
flooded
with
just
extensive
litigation
because
all
of
those
claimants
who
have
one
cent
that
when
they
get
together
and
get
$10,000.01
together
under
a
separate
and
distinct
claim
procedure
will
have
the
forum
of
this
court
available
to
them.
this
petitioner
represent
--
recognized
the
separate
and
distinct
nature
of
its
claim
throughout
and
we
merely
urge
upon
this
court
that
the
decisions
of
the
fifth
circuit
which
this
court
--
which
applied
for
certiorari
to
this
court
and
which
is
subsequently
denied
the
decision
of
the
eight
circuit
and
of
by
the
way
some
of
the
federal
districts
of
illinois
are
very
well
reasoned
and
have
arrived
at
a
proper
result.
i
would
call
the
court's
attention
to
one
other
case.
there
are
two
cases
in
illinois
which
go
in
opposite
routes
and
it
would
be
our
position
that
the
booth
versus
general
dynamics
case
which
seems
to
permit
an
aggregation.
actually,
was
viewed
in
the
lesh
case
also
cited
in
our
brief
and
recognized
by
the
lesh
case
as
reaching
an
improper
result.
i
would
also
like
to
call
this
court's
attention
to
the
gas
service
company
case.
the
tenth
circuit
in
reaching
its
result,
it
was
at
least
was
our
determination
in
relying
on
the
gibbs
versus
buck
case
has
misconstrued
the
decision
of
that
case
but
that
in
fact
in
that
case
an
examination
shows
that
all
of
the
parties
that
were
petitioners
to
that
case
have
the
requisite
jurisdictional
amount
so
that
there
was
no
question
here
as
to
whether
aggregation
was
required.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
buck
case,
gibbs
versus
buck
case
reiterates
and
reaffirms
the
earlier
and
later
decisions
of
this
court
that
the
aggregation
doctrine
is
a
well
thought
up
and
a
well
situated
doctrine
that
should
not
be
wiped
away
and
i
would
suggest
to
this
court
that
if
the
court
feels
that
amended
rule
23
(b)
permits
this
than
what
the
court
is
doing
is
in
one
fell's
hoop
is
wiping
out
the
aggregation
doctrine
which
seems
to
us
to
be
a
very
realistic
doctrine
that
has
been
established
for
over
a
hundred
years
in
this
court.
thank
you
very
much.
