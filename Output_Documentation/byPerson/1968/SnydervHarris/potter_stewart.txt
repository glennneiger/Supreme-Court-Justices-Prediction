justice
potter
stewart
that's
joinder,
that's
not
a
class
action.
that
that
appears
from
the
language
is
to
be
simple
joinder.
justice
potter
stewart
well
except
that
congress
i
suppose
can
be
presumed
to
have
known
the
case
law
at
the
time
it
enacted
these
various
jurisdictional
amounts.
isn't
that
fair
to
say?
justice
potter
stewart
in
this
$10,000.00
--
the
current
$10,000.00
jurisdictional
amount
in
diversity
jurisdiction,
i
suppose
reflects
some
sort
of
a
policy
on
the
part
of
congress
to
limit
diversity
jurisdiction
to
that
extent.
justice
potter
stewart
and
in
so
limiting
it,
i
suppose
the
congress
as
i
said
earlier
can
--
we
have
to
assume
the
congress
knew
about
the
cases
that
had
construed
the
requirements
with
respect
to
class
actions,
isn't
that?
justice
potter
stewart
and
back
then
the
amount
was
$500.00.
justice
potter
stewart
in
other
words
you
agree
that
this
is
not
a
derivative
action?
justice
potter
stewart
i
haven't
read
that
opinion
of
--
that
story
opinion
but
it
seems
to
enter
with
appellate
jurisdiction
rather
than
diversity
jurisdiction
of
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
the
language
as
quoted
in
your
brief.
justice
potter
stewart
it
didn't
directly
have
to
do
with
diversity
jurisdiction?
justice
potter
stewart
so
it
was
in
admiralty,
right?
justice
potter
stewart
each
individual
claim.
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
do
not
need
to
go
that
far
to
win
your
lawsuit,
do
you?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
not
of
this,
so
far
as
you
know
nobody
here
has
a
claim
of
as
much
as
$10,000.00.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
you
do
not
question
the
proposition
that
this
action
is
a
class
action
under
amended
rule
23
at
least
under
(b)
(3),
you
don’t
quarrel
about
that?
justice
potter
stewart
no.
justice
potter
stewart
categorize
it,
under
the
rule.
justice
potter
stewart
yup.
justice
potter
stewart
and
did
you,
the
guys
say
that
your
state
courts
procedurally
allow
for
class
actions
of
this
type?
justice
potter
stewart
so-called
spurious
class
action.
justice
potter
stewart
you
pretty
much
adopted
the
counterpart
of
the
federal
rules.
justice
potter
stewart
and
is
haven't
yet
amended
them
as
at
least
haven't
amended
them.
justice
potter
stewart
of
doing
so.
justice
potter
stewart
the
federal
--
the
original
federal
rule
to
civil
procedure
in
other
rules
provided
for
a
joinder,
joinder
of
parties
and
joinder
of
causes
of
actions
--
justice
potter
stewart
basically
there
was
a
very
free
joinder?
justice
potter
stewart
and
still
is,
what
would
have
been
the
--
if
a
so-called
spurious
class
action
is
nothing
more
nor
less
than
something
that
covers
permissive
joinder,
what
would
have
been
the
point
of
putting
it
in
there
along
with
the
joinder
rules?
justice
potter
stewart
except
you
do
have
(b)
(1),
(b)
(2),
(b)
(3)?
justice

mr.
martin,
excuse
me,
we've
been
talking
about
the
jurisdictional
amount
ingredient
of
federal
diversity
jurisdiction,
how
about
the
diversity
ingredient,
the
diversity
of
citizenship
ingredient
of
diversity
jurisdiction.
what
if
some
members
of
the
class
have
the
same
citizens
of
the
same
status,
the
defendant
and
they
don't
opt
out,
does
that
defeat
diversity
jurisdiction?
justice
potter
stewart
and
what
do
you
say
the
situation
is
now
under
new
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
existence
of
those
people
don't
defeat
diversity
in
your
submission?
justice
potter
stewart
it
doesn't
in
their
decisions
to
that
effect,
are
they?
