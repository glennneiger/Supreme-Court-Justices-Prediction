justice
abe
fortas
well
your
position
really
means
that
the
jurisdictional
amount
is
not
“would
not
be
consequential
for
purposes
of
determining
federal
jurisdiction
in
diversity
case,”
that's
a
practical
effect,
that
would
of
course
--
in
theory
you
could
have
as
--
my
brother
white's
question
indicated
you
could
have
enough
stockholder
saying
we
don't
want
to
be
included
so
that
the
remaining
group
would
not
have
the
$10,000.00
jurisdictional
amount,
but
actually
the
position
that
you
take
construing
the
rule
wouldn't
mean
that
anybody
could
start
a
stockholder's
derivative
action
as
a
practical
matter
and
would
not
be
troubled
by
the
jurisdiction
--
requirement
of
a
jurisdictional
amount.
justice
abe
fortas
this
probably
would
--
probably
worth
bringing
the
suit?
justice
abe
fortas
but
it
isn't
quite
bad,
is
it?
it's
a
question
of
whether
you
have
to
litigate
in
a
state
or
to
federal
courts.
justice
abe
fortas
i
mean
to
say
you
have
a
forum.
justice
abe
fortas
well
isn't
the
claim
in
the
present
case
peculiarly
a
derivative
claim?
that
is
to
say
a
claim
of
the
corporation
against
some
of
its
officers
and
directors?
justice
abe
fortas
well
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
you,
isn't
the
claim
here
corporate
mismanagement
or
use
of
inside,
the
claim
here,
let's
say
now
as
i
recall
it,
the
claim
is
that
the
insiders
sold
their
stock
to
--
at
a
specially
high
price
to
a
company
which
sought
to
acquire
control
of
your
claim,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
at
a
premium
price.
justice
abe
fortas
now
the
resulting
--
the
resulting
cause
of
action
is
conventionally
speaking
a
corporate
cause
of
action,
is
it
not?
justice
abe
fortas
and
this
would
be
typically
a
derivative
stockholder's
action.
justice
abe
fortas
now
let
us
suppose
that
the
stockholder
here
had
brought
this
as
a
derivative
action,
that
is
to
say,
assert
of
the
cause
of
action
on
behalf
of
the
corporation
or
recovery
to
go
to
the
corporation
if
the
suit
were
successful.
would
you
still
challenge
the
jurisdictional
amount?
justice
abe
fortas
well
that's
a
derivative
stockholder's
action.
justice
abe
fortas
well
you
say
to
be
conceivable,
i
go
with
you,
i
could
conceive
of
a
lot
of
things.
justice
abe
fortas
but
do
you
think
that
is
a
correct
construction,
correct
interpretation
of
the
law.
in
other
words,
this
i
believe
that
the
question
is
quite
relevant
to
your
case
when
i
say
so,
because
the
question
that
we
have
to
consider
is
whether
the
rule
that
we
would
lay
down
in
this
case
will
also
apply
to
a
derivative
stockholder's
action
or
would
not
--
or
whether
the
two
are
distinguishable,
that's
really
what
i'm
asking
you.
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
asking
you
whether
the
rule
that
with
respect
to
computing
jurisdictional
amount
in
the
case
before
us
now
would
necessarily
apply,
had
the
stockholder
here
brought
a
derivative
stockholder's
action
whether
you
say
that
the
rule
is
the
same
or
if
it's
different
and
if
you
think
that
it
would
be
different,
what
would
be
the
rule
in
a
derivative
action?
justice
abe
fortas
you
mean
that
stockholder
owning
one
share
of
stock
worth
$1.00
would
have
--
would
satisfy
the
requirements
of
jurisdictional
amount
provided
that
it
brought
a
derivative
stockholder's
action?
justice
abe
fortas
no
but
she
is
not.
justice
abe
fortas
she
brought
a
class
action.
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
nobody
comes
in
and
joins
here.
justice
abe
fortas
been
--
and
what
would
be
and
let's
suppose
the
court
--
and
let's
suppose
the
plaintiff
wins.
now,
would
the
judgment
rendered
by
the
court
be
related
solely
to
these
ones,
stockholder's
holdings
or
would
it
be
a
judgment
on
behalf
of
the
entire
class?
justice
abe
fortas
well
then
you
are
back
to
the
point
of
saying
that
this
is
not
a
proper
class
action
under
the
rule
as
amended,
aren't
you?
justice
abe
fortas
alright,
you
understand
my
point,
my
quarrel
with
you
because
i'm
saying
that
if
you
say
that
this
is
a
proper
class
action
under
rule
23
as
amended,
then
i
believe
you
have
the
greatest
difficulty
in
sustaining
your
position
that
the
recovery
would
be
limited
to
the
damages
according
to
this
single
stockholder
on
the
kind
of
her
single
holdings.
justice
abe
fortas
your
adversary
says
that
that's
not
the
way
you
framed
your
complaint.
if
you
framed
your
complaint
that
way
then
it
might
very
well
be
argued
that
that
is
a
way
of
determining
the
amount
in
controversy
and
that
the
amount
in
controversy
namely
the
judgment
to
be
entered
if
you
win
exceeds
$10,000.00
and
your
argument
has
a
point.
your
adversary
seems
to
contest
that
that
is
the
way
you
drafted
your
complaint
that
says
you
got
a
complaint
in
the
state
court
as
i
remember
that
on
that
theory
but
that
this
is
not
such
an
action
and
i
take
it
you
dispute
that.
justice
abe
fortas
well
you
would
say
then
that
the
only
judgment
the
court
can
render
here,
let's
assume
that
you
got
all
the
jurisdictional
amount
hurdle,
the
only
judgment
the
court
could
render
here
would
be
on
the
base
--
would
be
based
on
the
claims
of
the
individual
claimants.
justice
abe
fortas
so
there
are
ten
more
with
a
$7.00
each
or
total
amount
of
a
judgment
be
$70.00.
justice
abe
fortas
you
don't
think
that
the
purpose
of
the
amendment
for
the
rules
was
to
overcome
precisely
that
situation?
justice
abe
fortas
it
doesn't
really
matter
whether
it's
diversity
or
not,
suppose
somehow
rather
that
this
were
--
suppose
some
other
than
diversity,
the
jurisdictional
amount
were
not
available,
you
just
think
that
this
is
not
a
proper
class
action.
you
think
this
is
not
a
proper
class
action?
justice
abe
fortas
and
you
don't
and
it
doesn't
tell
you
or
does
it
have
any
bearing
on
how
much
can
be
repaired
ultimately
what
the
judgment
can
be,
it's
a
judgment
limited
to
the
individual
plaintiffs
who
have
joined.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
let's
take
your
case
and
let's
suppose
that
the
plaintiff
here
lost
and
let's
suppose
that
some
other
user
of
gas
service
brought
subsequent
suit
exactly
the
same
sort,
would
he
be
--
would
the
doctrine
of
collateral
estoppel
buy
that
suit?
justice
abe
fortas
no,
no.
not
a
named
party
at
all
but
this
suit
is
--
let's
suppose
that
present
suit
goes
at
the
judgment
and
the
judgment
runs
against
the
plaintiff
here.
another
guest
user
situated
in
exactly
the
same
position
brings
a
subsequent
suit
that
as
you
know
is
sometimes
a
very
--
as
a
useful
way
to
get
--
work
backwards
to
the
nature
of
the
action.
justice
abe
fortas
now
would
he
be
--
or
would
he
be
stopped,
suit
was
a
matter
of
public
record
and
he
didn't
join
that.
let
us
assume
he
could
have
joined
that
but
he
didn't
join
in
it
and
he
brings
subsequent
suit.
justice
abe
fortas
well
then,
you're
assuming
that
it's
a
class
action,
aren't
you?
justice
abe
fortas
and
so,
do
you
concede
that
this
is
a
class
action
in
which
a
compulsory
class
action
in
which
in
effect
the
kind
of
a
class
action
in
which
joinder
is
compulsory
in
the
sense
that
if
a
person
in
the
same
situation
does
not
join
is
forever
barred?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
it
must
be,
would
you
say
that
he
is
bound
unless
--
maybe
i
misunderstood
you.
he's
bound
unless
he
opts
out
and
this
is
not
a
permissive
joinder
case
but
it
is
a
true
class
action.
justice
abe
fortas
but
maybe
i
never
heard
that
term
but
it
has
certain
chime
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
this
is
pretty
close
to
a
true
class
action,
isn't
it
if
it's
not
a
true
class
action.
this
one
--
i
--
part
from
how
it's
phrased,
i'm
going
to
call
how
the
complaint
was
framed
up.
justice
abe
fortas
no,
we're
not
talking
about
prior
to
the
enactment
of
this
rule.
this
rule,
you
are
not
asking
us,
you're
addressing
an
argument
to
us
on
the
jurisdictional
amount
but
i
take
it
that
your
argument
does
not
necessarily
amount
to
a
plea
to
us
to
have
a
way
at
the
rule
itself.
justice
abe
fortas
so,
let's
take
it
under
this
rule.
under
this
rule
i
suggest
to
you
that
this
is
the
possibility
that
this
is
a
--
exactly
the
kind
of
a
situation
that
the
rule
contemplated
as
a
class
action.
justice
abe
fortas
so,
that
if
somebody
does
not
doubt,
he
is
forever
barred?
justice
abe
fortas
and
on
the
whether
--
then
the
question
is,
do
you
or
do
you
not
properly
infer
from
that
--
from
those
legal
consequences
a
conclusion
with
respect
to
the
jurisdictional
amount,
what
you
call
an
aggregation
or
something
else,
am
i
right?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
everybody
here
is
claiming
it.
the
claim
here
is
a
--
is
exactly
the
same
with
respect
to
old
members
of
a
large
and
definable
group,
the
only
thing
that
differs
is
the
amount.
justice
abe
fortas
from
the
case
of
each
claim,
now
what
more
do
you
want
for
a
--
an
aggregation
case
or
whatever
words
you
want
to
use?
justice
abe
fortas
if
this
is
not
a
case
in
which
you
can
put
together
the
total
amount
of
the
claim,
could
you
state
one
to
me?
forgetting
the
derivate
of
--
the
stockholder's
derivative
action
cases
which
i
think
you
properly
distinguished
and
which
is
involved
in
the
preceding
case
which
however
was
brought
as
a
class
action.
apart
from
that,
can
you
give
me
any
case
in
which
there
can
be
a
proper
aggregation
or
pooling
of
amount?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that
--
that
action
be
brought
by
the
trustee
alone?
justice
abe
fortas
that's
either
like
derivative
action
or
it's
like
this
action,
isn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
i
beg
your
pardon,
mr.
martin,
let's
get
back
then
to
the
language
of
28
u.s.c.
1332,
when
the
first
paragraph
of
it
referring
to
the
$10,000.00
jurisdictional
requirement
refers
to
the
matter
in
controversy
that
is
to
say
the
matter
in
controversy
has
to
exceed
$10,000.00,
that's
1332
(a),
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
and
i
suppose
your
argument
is
that
taking
the
amended
rule
23
(a)
assuming
that
this
case
comes
within
23
(a)
then
it
follows
at
the
amount
in
controversy
is
the
amount
to
which
all
of
the
persons
in
the
class
would
be
entitled
if
they
were
successful.
justice
abe
fortas
and
that
is
the
manner
in
controversy
and
therefore
you
say
it
satisfies
1332
(a),
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
now
one
of
the
problems
if
we
go
back
to
the
source
and
get
underneath
the
class
of
the
ages
of
the
statute,
one
of
the
problems
comes
in
subsection
(b)
and
in
subsection
(b)
as
a
reference
to
the
denial
of
cause
to
the
plaintiff
where
he
is
finally
judged
where
the
plaintiff
who
files
a
case
originally,
the
plaintiff
who
files
the
case
originally
and
the
federal
courts
has
finally
judged
to
be
entitled
or
recover
less
than
the
sum
of
$10,000.00.
now,
if
that
is
to
be
taken
as
bearing
upon
the
meaning
of
the
term
matter
in
controversy,
then
you
got
a
real
problem,
haven't
you?
justice
abe
fortas
question
is
whether
it's
a
general
amount
in
controversy,
are
the
amount
in
controversy
measured
solely
by
the
claim
of
the
plaintiff
who
originally
files
a
case
in
the
federal
court,
that's
right,
isn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
exactly,
in
other
words,
historically
despite
the
language
of
subsection
(b),
aggregation
has
been
permitted
in
certain
instances
--
justice
abe
fortas
under
the
rules
and
your
argument
is
that
since
23
(a)
eliminates
the
distinction
between
true
spurious
and
hybrid
class
actions
and
since
in
your
submission,
all
class
actions
under
23
(a)
are
now
to
be
considered
as
true
class
actions,
therefore
the
line
of
cases
permitting
aggregation
in
the
case
of
true
class
actions
should
control
here.
justice
abe
fortas
well
your
position
really
means
that
the
jurisdictional
amount
is
not
“would
not
be
consequential
for
purposes
of
determining
federal
jurisdiction
in
diversity
case,”
that's
a
practical
effect,
that
would
of
course
--
in
theory
you
could
have
as
--
my
brother
white's
question
indicated
you
could
have
enough
stockholder
saying
we
don't
want
to
be
included
so
that
the
remaining
group
would
not
have
the
$10,000.00
jurisdictional
amount,
but
actually
the
position
that
you
take
construing
the
rule
wouldn't
mean
that
anybody
could
start
a
stockholder's
derivative
action
as
a
practical
matter
and
would
not
be
troubled
by
the
jurisdiction
--
requirement
of
a
jurisdictional
amount.
justice
abe
fortas
this
probably
would
--
probably
worth
bringing
the
suit?
justice
abe
fortas
but
it
isn't
quite
bad,
is
it?
it's
a
question
of
whether
you
have
to
litigate
in
a
state
or
to
federal
courts.
justice
abe
fortas
i
mean
to
say
you
have
a
forum.
justice
abe
fortas
well
isn't
the
claim
in
the
present
case
peculiarly
a
derivative
claim?
that
is
to
say
a
claim
of
the
corporation
against
some
of
its
officers
and
directors?
justice
abe
fortas
well
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
you,
isn't
the
claim
here
corporate
mismanagement
or
use
of
inside,
the
claim
here,
let's
say
now
as
i
recall
it,
the
claim
is
that
the
insiders
sold
their
stock
to
--
at
a
specially
high
price
to
a
company
which
sought
to
acquire
control
of
your
claim,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
at
a
premium
price.
justice
abe
fortas
now
the
resulting
--
the
resulting
cause
of
action
is
conventionally
speaking
a
corporate
cause
of
action,
is
it
not?
justice
abe
fortas
and
this
would
be
typically
a
derivative
stockholder's
action.
justice
abe
fortas
now
let
us
suppose
that
the
stockholder
here
had
brought
this
as
a
derivative
action,
that
is
to
say,
assert
of
the
cause
of
action
on
behalf
of
the
corporation
or
recovery
to
go
to
the
corporation
if
the
suit
were
successful.
would
you
still
challenge
the
jurisdictional
amount?
justice
abe
fortas
well
that's
a
derivative
stockholder's
action.
justice
abe
fortas
well
you
say
to
be
conceivable,
i
go
with
you,
i
could
conceive
of
a
lot
of
things.
justice
abe
fortas
but
do
you
think
that
is
a
correct
construction,
correct
interpretation
of
the
law.
in
other
words,
this
i
believe
that
the
question
is
quite
relevant
to
your
case
when
i
say
so,
because
the
question
that
we
have
to
consider
is
whether
the
rule
that
we
would
lay
down
in
this
case
will
also
apply
to
a
derivative
stockholder's
action
or
would
not
--
or
whether
the
two
are
distinguishable,
that's
really
what
i'm
asking
you.
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
asking
you
whether
the
rule
that
with
respect
to
computing
jurisdictional
amount
in
the
case
before
us
now
would
necessarily

had
the
stockholder
here
brought
a
derivative
stockholder's
action
whether
you
say
that
the
rule
is
the
same
or
if
it's
different
and
if
you
think
that
it
would
be
different,
what
would
be
the
rule
in
a
derivative
action?
justice
abe
fortas
you
mean
that
stockholder
owning
one
share
of
stock
worth
$1.00
would
have
--
would
satisfy
the
requirements
of
jurisdictional
amount
provided
that
it
brought
a
derivative
stockholder's
action?
justice
abe
fortas
no
but
she
is
not.
justice
abe
fortas
she
brought
a
class
action.
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
nobody
comes
in
and
joins
here.
justice
abe
fortas
been
--
and
what
would
be
and
let's
suppose
the
court
--
and
let's
suppose
the
plaintiff
wins.
now,
would
the
judgment
rendered
by
the
court
be
related
solely
to
these
ones,
stockholder's
holdings
or
would
it
be
a
judgment
on
behalf
of
the
entire
class?
justice
abe
fortas
well
then
you
are
back
to
the
point
of
saying
that
this
is
not
a
proper
class
action
under
the
rule
as
amended,
aren't
you?
justice
abe
fortas
alright,
you
understand
my
point,
my
quarrel
with
you
because
i'm
saying
that
if
you
say
that
this
is
a
proper
class
action
under
rule
23
as
amended,
then
i
believe
you
have
the
greatest
difficulty
in
sustaining
your
position
that
the
recovery
would
be
limited
to
the
damages
according
to
this
single
stockholder
on
the
kind
of
her
single
holdings.
justice
abe
fortas
your
adversary
says
that
that's
not
the
way
you
framed
your
complaint.
if
you
framed
your
complaint
that
way
then
it
might
very
well
be
argued
that
that
is
a
way
of
determining
the
amount
in
controversy
and
that
the
amount
in
controversy
namely
the
judgment
to
be
entered
if
you
win
exceeds
$10,000.00
and
your
argument
has
a
point.
your
adversary
seems
to
contest
that
that
is
the
way
you
drafted
your
complaint
that
says
you
got
a
complaint
in
the
state
court
as
i
remember
that
on
that
theory
but
that
this
is
not
such
an
action
and
i
take
it
you
dispute
that.
justice
abe
fortas
well
you
would
say
then
that
the
only
judgment
the
court
can
render
here,
let's
assume
that
you
got
all
the
jurisdictional
amount
hurdle,
the
only
judgment
the
court
could
render
here
would
be
on
the
base
--
would
be
based
on
the
claims
of
the
individual
claimants.
justice
abe
fortas
so
there
are
ten
more
with
a
$7.00
each
or
total
amount
of
a
judgment
be
$70.00.
justice
abe
fortas
you
don't
think
that
the
purpose
of
the
amendment
for
the
rules
was
to
overcome
precisely
that
situation?
justice
abe
fortas
it
doesn't
really
matter
whether
it's
diversity
or
not,
suppose
somehow
rather
that
this
were
--
suppose
some
other
than
diversity,
the
jurisdictional
amount
were
not
available,
you
just
think
that
this
is
not
a
proper
class
action.
you
think
this
is
not
a
proper
class
action?
justice
abe
fortas
and
you
don't
and
it
doesn't
tell
you
or
does
it
have
any
bearing
on
how
much
can
be
repaired
ultimately
what
the
judgment
can
be,
it's
a
judgment
limited
to
the
individual
plaintiffs
who
have
joined.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
let's
take
your
case
and
let's
suppose
that
the
plaintiff
here
lost
and
let's
suppose
that
some
other
user
of
gas
service
brought
subsequent
suit
exactly
the
same
sort,
would
he
be
--
would
the
doctrine
of
collateral
estoppel
buy
that
suit?
justice
abe
fortas
no,
no.
not
a
named
party
at
all
but
this
suit
is
--
let's
suppose
that
present
suit
goes
at
the
judgment
and
the
judgment
runs
against
the
plaintiff
here.
another
guest
user
situated
in
exactly
the
same
position
brings
a
subsequent
suit
that
as
you
know
is
sometimes
a
very
--
as
a
useful
way
to
get
--
work
backwards
to
the
nature
of
the
action.
justice
abe
fortas
now
would
he
be
--
or
would
he
be
stopped,
suit
was
a
matter
of
public
record
and
he
didn't
join
that.
let
us
assume
he
could
have
joined
that
but
he
didn't
join
in
it
and
he
brings
subsequent
suit.
justice
abe
fortas
well
then,
you're
assuming
that
it's
a
class
action,
aren't
you?
justice
abe
fortas
and
so,
do
you
concede
that
this
is
a
class
action
in
which
a
compulsory
class
action
in
which
in
effect
the
kind
of
a
class
action
in
which
joinder
is
compulsory
in
the
sense
that
if
a
person
in
the
same
situation
does
not
join
is
forever
barred?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
it
must
be,
would
you
say
that
he
is
bound
unless
--
maybe
i
misunderstood
you.
he's
bound
unless
he
opts
out
and
this
is
not
a
permissive
joinder
case
but
it
is
a
true
class
action.
justice
abe
fortas
but
maybe
i
never
heard
that
term
but
it
has
certain
chime
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
this
is
pretty
close
to
a
true
class
action,
isn't
it
if
it's
not
a
true
class
action.
this
one
--
i
--
part
from
how
it's
phrased,
i'm
going
to
call
how
the
complaint
was
framed
up.
justice
abe
fortas
no,
we're
not
talking
about
prior
to
the
enactment
of
this
rule.
this
rule,
you
are
not
asking
us,
you're
addressing
an
argument
to
us
on
the
jurisdictional
amount
but
i
take
it
that
your
argument
does
not
necessarily
amount
to
a
plea
to
us
to
have
a
way
at
the
rule
itself.
justice
abe
fortas
so,
let's
take
it
under
this
rule.
under
this
rule
i
suggest
to
you
that
this
is
the
possibility
that
this
is
a
--
exactly
the
kind
of
a
situation
that
the
rule
contemplated
as
a
class
action.
justice
abe
fortas
so,
that
if
somebody
does
not
doubt,
he
is
forever
barred?
justice
abe
fortas
and
on
the
whether
--
then
the
question
is,
do
you
or
do
you
not
properly
infer
from
that
--
from
those
legal
consequences
a
conclusion
with
respect
to
the
jurisdictional
amount,
what
you
call
an
aggregation
or
something
else,
am
i
right?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
everybody
here
is
claiming
it.
the
claim
here
is
a
--
is
exactly
the
same
with
respect
to
old
members
of
a
large
and
definable
group,
the
only
thing
that
differs
is
the
amount.
justice
abe
fortas
from
the
case
of
each
claim,
now
what
more
do
you
want
for
a
--
an
aggregation
case
or
whatever
words
you
want
to
use?
justice
abe
fortas
if
this
is
not
a
case
in
which
you
can
put
together
the
total
amount
of
the
claim,
could
you
state
one
to
me?
forgetting
the
derivate
of
--
the
stockholder's
derivative
action
cases
which
i
think
you
properly
distinguished
and
which
is
involved
in
the
preceding
case
which
however
was
brought
as
a
class
action.
apart
from
that,
can
you
give
me
any
case
in
which
there
can
be
a
proper
aggregation
or
pooling
of
amount?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that
--
that
action
be
brought
by
the
trustee
alone?
justice
abe
fortas
that's
either
like
derivative
action
or
it's
like
this
action,
isn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
i
beg
your
pardon,
mr.
martin,
let's
get
back
then
to
the
language
of
28
u.s.c.
1332,
when
the
first
paragraph
of
it
referring
to
the
$10,000.00
jurisdictional
requirement
refers
to
the
matter
in
controversy
that
is
to
say
the
matter
in
controversy
has
to
exceed
$10,000.00,
that's
1332
(a),
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
and
i
suppose
your
argument
is
that
taking
the
amended
rule
23
(a)
assuming
that
this
case
comes
within
23
(a)
then
it
follows
at
the
amount
in
controversy
is
the
amount
to
which
all
of
the
persons
in
the
class
would
be
entitled
if
they
were
successful.
justice
abe
fortas
and
that
is
the
manner
in
controversy
and
therefore
you
say
it
satisfies
1332
(a),
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
now
one
of
the
problems
if
we
go
back
to
the
source
and
get
underneath
the
class
of
the
ages
of
the
statute,
one
of
the
problems
comes
in
subsection
(b)
and
in
subsection
(b)
as
a
reference
to
the
denial
of
cause
to
the
plaintiff
where
he
is
finally
judged
where
the
plaintiff
who
files
a
case
originally,
the
plaintiff
who
files
the
case
originally
and
the
federal
courts
has
finally
judged
to
be
entitled
or
recover
less
than
the
sum
of
$10,000.00.
now,
if
that
is
to
be
taken
as
bearing
upon
the
meaning
of
the
term
matter
in
controversy,
then
you
got
a
real
problem,
haven't
you?
justice
abe
fortas
question
is
whether
it's
a
general
amount
in
controversy,
are
the
amount
in
controversy
measured
solely
by
the
claim
of
the
plaintiff
who
originally
files
a
case
in
the
federal
court,
that's
right,
isn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
exactly,
in
other
words,
historically
despite
the
language
of
subsection
(b),
aggregation
has
been
permitted
in
certain
instances
--
justice
abe
fortas
under
the
rules
and
your
argument
is
that
since
23
(a)
eliminates
the
distinction
between
true
spurious
and
hybrid
class
actions
and
since
in
your
submission,
all
class
actions
under
23
(a)
are
now
to
be
considered
as
true
class
actions,
therefore
the
line
of
cases
permitting
aggregation
in
the
case
of
true
class
actions
should
control
here.
