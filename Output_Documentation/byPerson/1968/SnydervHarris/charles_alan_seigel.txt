mr.
charles
alan
seigel
yes,
your
honor,
justice.
mr.
justice,
this
is
a
case
that
was
initially
instituted
in
the
eastern
district
of
missouri
by
the
petitioner,
a
diversity
case
brought
under
the
federal
rule
23,
the
class
action
rules
seeking
to
recover
for
herself
and
for
some
4,000
members
of
her
class
a
judgment
in
the
amount
of
$1,200,000.00.
the
petitioner
is
the
owner
of
some
2,000
shares
of
stock
of
the
missouri
union
fidelity
insurance
company.
in
the
petitioner's
complaint,
it
is
alleged
that
the
national
western
life
insurance
company
entered
into
an
agreement
with
the
controlling
members
of
the
board
of
directors
of
missouri
fidelity
union
trust
company,
insurance
company,
whereby
the
national
western
agreed
that
they
would
buy
some
300,000
shares
of
stock
owned
by
the
directors
and
members
of
the
directors
family
for
a
premium
price
of
a
$1,200,000.00
and
by
premium
price
i
mean
$1,200,000.00
over
what
the
stock
was
sell
for
in
the
market
and
the
condition
was,
is
that
these
directors
resign
and
that
--
and
that
is
what
happened.
the
directors
did
resign
on
the
shares
being
purchased
and
the
nominees
and
national
western
were
then
elected
to
control
to
the
board
of
directors
and
were
then
elected
to
control
of
the
executive
committee
and
the
financial
committee.
the
relief
sought
in
the
petition,
the
complaint
was
that
this
$1,200,000.00
should
be
distributed
to
the
shareholders
of
missouri
union
fidelity
because
that
this
was
an
illegal
sale
of
the
officers
of
the
directors
and
it
was
a
breach
of
trust
owed
by
the
directors
to
the
stockholders.
the
respondent
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
taking
the
position
in
the
motion
to
dismiss
that
the
claim
of
each
member
of
the
class
was
a
separate
and
distinct
claim
and
that
in
as
much
as
the
claim,
the
respective
amount
of
the
petitioner's
case
was
only
$8,740.00
that
the
jurisdictional
amount
of
$10,000.00
had
not
been
met.
the
district
judge,
district
court
sustained
this
motion.
this
was
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
certiorari
is
applied
for
and
granted
to
the
court
on
this
matter.
the
sustaining
of
this
motion
to
dismiss
is
what
made
up
the
issues
in
this
case.
the
respondents'
claim
that
under
the
old
rule,
federal
rule
23
and
of
many
cases
decided
before
the
amended
rule
of
federal
rule
23,
is
that
you
could
not
aggregate,
you
cannot
aggregate
separate
and
distinct
claims.
it's
the
position
of
the
petitioner
that
amended
rule,
federal
rule
23
does
awake
completely
with
any
designation
of
separate
distinction
claims
and
that
under
federal
rule
23
there
is
provided
for
one
action
and
one
judgment
finding
on
the
whole
class
except
those
who
want
to
be
--
indicate
that
they
want
to
be
excluded.
there
is
no
such
thing
as
separate
and
distinct
claim,
therefore
aggregation
is
permitted.
now
going
into
a
little
history,
the
united
states
constitution
article
3
says
that
the
judicial
power
should
be
in
one
supreme
court
and
then
such
inferior
courts
as
the
congress
should
then
designate.
the
section
2
of
the
constitution
provides
that
the
judicial
powers
should
extend
to
matters
of
citizens
of
different
states.
now
in
the
judicial
act
of
1789,
there
was
set
forth
by
congress
the
jurisdiction
amount
of
$500.00
for
jurisdiction
in
district
courts.
this
has
now
been
extended
presently
to
$10,000.00.
as
might
be
expected
after
there
was
set
this
jurisdictional
limit,
there
came
up
the
problem
--
there
came
the
problem
as
what
happens
in
joinder
cases
and
what
happens
in
class
action
cases,
how
do
you
compute
to
$10,000.00.
for
the
courts
then
looked,
they
cannot
look
to
statute,
there
was
nothing
in
the
statute
a
term
saying
how
it
should
be
determined.
there's
nothing
in
the
constitution
so
they
then
look
to
their
rules,
the
rules
of
common
law
and
of
equity
practice
as
it
grew
up
as
to
joinder
equity
practice
and
also
the
interpretations
to
the
old
amended
--
old
federal
rule
23
which
really
was
a
codification
of
the
rule,
the
old
rules
of
common
law
joinder
and
of
equity
practice.
and
as
we
go
back
and
to
look
at
the
common
law
rules
of
joinder
class
actions
and
of
equity
practice,
and
as
also
was
--
were
codified
in
federal
rule
23,
we
find
that
there
was
such
terms
used
as
joint
and
common
and
separate
and
distinct
and
the
courts
came
down
with
this
theory.
they
came
down
with
this
theory
by
looking
not
at
the
statutes,
not
the
constitution
but
at
their
own
procedural
rules
and
they
came
with
this
conclusion
that
if
there
was
a
joint
action
and
that
would
be
an
action
for
example
when
there
was
an
interpretation
of
a
trust,
a
raise
that
would
be
binding
and
all
the
parties
plaintiff,
this
was
a
true
class
action
and
therefore
aggregation
should
be
permitted.
but
if
there
was
a
separate
and
distinct
claims,
such
as
the
claims
which
we
admit
under
the
prior
rule
would
be
this
particular
case
that
these
could
not
be
aggregated
because
there
could
be
separate
judgments
and
in
every
respect
under
federal
rule
23,
the
old
federal
rule
23
and
under
the
old
equity
and
common
law
practice,
the
--
even
though
there
was
a
joinder
or
clause
of
class
action
when
there
was
a
separate
distinct
claims,
each
claim
maintained
its
own
identity.
this
joint
and
several
claims
were
called
spurious
claims
and
in
these
claims
the
court
would
not
allow
aggregation
and
again
under
federal
rule
23,
the
old
rule
federal
23
is
that
the
only
effect
of
a
joinder
and
a
class
action
whether
a
separate
or
distinct
claims
was
that
the
--
when
the
person
do
had
a
separate
distinct
claim
could
intervene
in
the
action.
it
was
not
binding
on
any
other
members
of
the
class
unless
the
class
member
actually
intervened
in
the
action
and
the
--
there
could
be
separate
and
distinct
judgments
and
there
could
be
a
judgment
for
plaintiff
and
it
could
be
against
the
plaintiff.
in
19
--
july
of
1967,
amended
rule
23
was
passed
and
basically
the
amended
rule
23
provides,
is
that
when
the
class
is
so
numerous,
they're
being
practical
to
join
all
the
parties
involved
and
there
are
common
questions
of
law
in
fact
common
to
the
class
and
that
their
claims
or
defenses
common
to
the
class
and
that
the
petitioner
will
fairly
represent
the
class
and
that
the
questions
of
law
in
fact
common
to
members
of
the
class
prevail
over
any
question
affecting
individual
members
then
a
class
action
may
be
maintained
and
then
after
--
if
a
judgment
is
entered,
the
rule
specifically
says,
the
judgment
--
does
not
say
the
judgments,
the
judgment
in
such
an
action,
not
in
actions,
shall
describe
the
member
of
this
class
and
shall
be
binding
on
all
members
of
the
class
who
do
not
notify
the
court
after
being
notified
by
the
court
that
the
action
is
pending
that
they
want
to
be
excluded.
so,
as
in
this
particular
case
if
the
petitioner
was
prevailed,
there
would
be
one
judgment
in
the
amount
of
$1,200,000.00
and
which
will
be
binding
on
all
members
of
the
class
except
those
members
who
notified
the
court
that
they
do
not
want
to
be
included
in
the
judgment.
mr.
charles
alan
seigel
mr.
justice,
they
would
be
distributed
to
each
member
of
this
class,
his
respective
share.
mr.
charles
alan
seigel
they
would
have
to
retain
the
right
to
bring
their
own
independent
action
mr.
justice.
they
could
bring
an
independent
action
for
example
in
the
state
court
action
if
they
so
desire.
mr.
charles
alan
seigel
there
could
be,
that's
correct
mr.
justice.
mr.
charles
alan
seigel
that
is
correct.
mr.
charles
alan
seigel
that
is
correct.
mr.
charles
alan
seigel
mr.
justice
the
--
mr.
charles
alan
seigel
they
could
maintain
that
action.
the
--
mr.
charles
alan
seigel
well,
if
they
do
not
have
the
$10,000.00
jurisdictional
amount
involved
between
them,
then
they
would
file
their
suit
in
the
state
court.
mr.
charles
alan
seigel
under
the
class
action
rules,
yes.
mr.
charles
alan
seigel
well,
if
their
claims
are
in
excess
of
$10,000.00,
they
could
bring
it
in
the
federal
court,
if
they
were
not,
they
would
bring
their
claims
in
the
state
court.
mr.
charles
alan
seigel
well,
in
that
case
mr.
justice
that
would
be
a
simple
case
of
joinder
of
two
--
mr.
charles
alan
seigel
--
of
two
plaintiffs
and
that
would
not
fall
under
the
class
action
rule
and
the
old
rules
as
far
as
joinder
would
apply.
mr.
charles
alan
seigel
that
is
correct.
mr.
charles
alan
seigel
well,
under
the
old
rule
that
this
was
strictly
a
joinder
case
mr.
justice,
that
would
be
correct
because
i
want
to
make
it
clear,
is
that
our
position
on
--
that
the
claim
should
be
aggregated
is
really
based
solely
--
mr.
charles
alan
seigel
--
on
amended
rule,
federal
rule
23.
mr.
charles
alan
seigel
and
under
the
case
that
mr.
justice
has
put
forth,
is
that
would
be
just
simply
a
permissive
joinder
--
mr.
charles
alan
seigel
and
i
think
that
we
have
to
look
to
the
old
court
decisions
on
that
and
that
there
would
not
be
aggregation
because
the
sole
basis
of
our
claim
for
aggregation
is
amended
rule
23
which
now
provides
for
one
judgment
finding
of
the
whole
class.
mr.
charles
alan
seigel
in
--
mr.
justice
in
the
case
that
you
mentioned,
there
could
be
--
there
would
be
not
one
judgment,
there
would
be
two
separate
judgments
because
this
thing
in
a
strictly
permissive
joinder
case,
there
is
not
provision
for
a
single
judgment.
there
--
it
would
be
a
judgment
for
each
plaintiff
and
--
mr.
charles
alan
seigel
that
is
correct.
mr.
charles
alan
seigel
that
is
correct,
that
is
correct.
but
i
might
point
this
out
that
theoretically
in
a
permissive
joinder
case,
there
could
be
different
judgments
whereas
in
a
class
action
under
amended
rule
23,
there
cannot
be
different
judgments,
there
is
one
judgment
that
is
binding
on
the
whole
class
and
there
is
only
one
consistent
judgment
that
cannot
be
separate
judgments
or
like
four
or
one
member
of
the
class
against
the
other
because
the
rule
says
that
if
the
claims
or
defenses
are
not
common,
then
there
should
not
be
a
class
action
rule.
so
there
is
no
possibility
of
inconsistent
judgment
and
amended
rule
23.
mr.
charles
alan
seigel
mr.
justice
that
would
be
so
as
long
as
the
--
the
aggregate
amount
of
the
total
claims
of
the
whole
class
was
in
excess
of
the
$10,000.00
jurisdiction.
mr.
charles
alan
seigel
right,
that's
correct.
the
respondents
have
contended
that
we
must
look
to
the
old
rules
as
to
aggregation.
the
old
rules
as
to
what
the
courts
--
the
decisions
what
the
courts
held
that
there
could
not
be
aggregation
if
there
were
separate
distinct
claims.
we
must
look
to
the
old
federal
rule
which
had
this
break
down
and
use
these
terms,
a
carryover
from
the
old
common
law
and
class
actions
of
joint
common
and
several
and
that
as
i
indicated
that
if
it
was
a
joint
claim,
there
could
be
aggregation
but
if
it
were
several,
there
cannot
be.
now,
that
is
what
the
respondents
looked
to
in
support
of
their
position.
but
now
when
the
petitioner
wants
to
look
at
amended
rule
23
to
find
out
that
there
can
be
aggregation
in
the
whole
claims,
the
respondents
now
claim
that
this
is
in
violation
of
rule
82
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
which
says
that
the
federal
rules
cannot
expand
federal
jurisdiction.
i
submit
that
if
the
petitioner
in
seeking
to
justify
aggregation
and
rule
--
under
amended
rule
23
is
in
violation
of
expanding
jurisdiction
then
the
respondents
in
looking
at
the
court's
interpretation
of
its
own
rules,
its
own
common
law
rules,
equity
rules
and
old
rule
federal
23
is
also
in
violation
of
the
restrictions
of
rule
82
which
says
not
only
must
you
not
extend
jurisdiction,
you
might
not
limit
jurisdiction.
otherwise
if
we
are
expanding
jurisdiction
by
looking
on
amended
rule
83,
they
are
limiting
jurisdiction
by
looking
at
the
old
federal
rule
23
and
we're
looking
at
the
court's
decisions
which
were
handed
down
before
the
old
rule
23,
obviously
a
court
cannot
limit
its
own
jurisdiction
but
actually
what
we
are
not
--
we're
not
really
talking
about
jurisdiction.
we
are
talking
about
procedure.
the
amended
rule
23
in
no
way
seeks
to
increase
or
decrease
the
amount
of
the
$10,000.00
jurisdictional
amount.
it
simply
provides
a
procedure
that
where
in
a
class
action
brought
under
amended
rule
23,
there
is
one
binding
judgment
and
this
judgment
is
binding
on
the
whole
class.
and
we
might
say
that
how
is
it
possible
in
a
case
such
as
this
one
when
there
is
one
binding
judgment
on
the
whole
class
which
would
--
could
be
in
amount
of
$1,200,000.00
that
there
is
not
in
controversy,
the
sum
of
$10,000.00.
again,
i
want
to
emphasize
is
that
we
are
talking
about
one
judgment
the
rule
speaks
about
one
judgment
and
one
action.
i've
been
talking
about
theory
and
there
is
a
practical
sensibility
to
the
amended
rule
23.
a
class
action
really
is
--
was
thought
of
and
enacted
and
devised
to
provide
a
form
to
get
rid
of
a
multitude
of
cases,
decide
them
all
in
one
case
and
also
it
was
devised
to
give
a
small
litigant,
a
chance
to
litigate
his
claim
of
the
makers
--
the
rule
recognized
this
when
they
--
in
their
statements,
the
advice
of
committee
notes
that
they
were
doing
their
way
completely
with
these
terms,
joint,
common,
several,
true,
spurious
and
hybrid
actions.
these
were
being
done
away
and
there
was
going
to
be
provided
new
amended
rule
23
would
provide
it
for
only
one
action.
these
terms
were
no
longer
going
to
be
looked
to
and
i
submit
that
if
we
take
the
interpretation
as
urged
by
the
respondent
in
this
case
that
there
would
never
be
a
very
seldom
ever
be
brought
an
action
under
--
excuse
me,
the
amended
class
action
rules.
and
as
for
this
reason,
the
first
requirement
of
amended
rule
23
is
that
the
class
be
so
numerous,
that
it
would
be
impractical
to
bring
them
all
before
the
court.
i
cannot
think
of
any
case
that
i've
read
or
heard
about
and
with
there
was
so
many
people
that
suffered
independent
damages
of
$10,000.00
that
they
could
not
be
brought
before
the
court
and
most
of
the
cases
such
as
the
case
we
are
talking
about,
you
find
persons
who
has
sustained
damages
of
$500.00,
a
thousand
dollars,
in
our
case,
the
petitioner
in
this
case
was
$8,740.00
but
in
very
few
case
if
any
will
you
find
so
many
people
that
would
be
impractical
to
bring
the
court,
each
one
of
them
has
sustained
a
$10,000.00
and
therefore
the
position
urged
by
the
respondent
really
completely
makes
rule
23,
amended
rule
23
a
nullity,
it
will
never
be
used
and
i
suggest
and
urge
this
court
that
the
interpretation
urged
by
the
petitioner
be
adopted.
that
was
the
intention
of
the
framers
of
the
rule
that
small
litigants
haven't
formed
to
litigate
their
claims
and
that
under
the
federal
--
amended
rule
23
that
there
would
be
one
action,
one
judgment
binding
on
all
the
members
of
the
class
that
have
not
chosen
to
be
excluded
and
certainly
in
this
case,
that
amount
would
be
for
an
excess
of
the
$10,000.00
jurisdictional
amount.
mr.
charles
alan
seigel
well
the
--
mr.
charles
alan
seigel
there
--
that's
true.
there
could
be
a
forum
but
i
think
that
the
litigants
are
entitled
to
an
impartial
forum
as
provided
for
--
by
the
diversity
of
the
citizen
--
the
citizenship
of
provisions
of
our
--
of
a
traditional
act
of
the
constitution,
pardon
me.
and
the
mere
fact
that
there
might
be
a
form
in
the
state
court,
does
not
mean
that
there
cannot
be
also
be
a
form
in
the
federal
court
and
i
think
it
was
the
intention
of
the
framers
to
have
a
rule
--
the
state
courts
--
none
that
i
know
have
this
particular
rule.
i
think
it
was
the
intention
of
the
framers
of
amended
rule
23
to
provide
such
a
form
because
it
was
seen
that
under
the
old
rule
is
that
no
class
actions
were
being
brought.
the
only
thing
that
was
happening
was,
is
that
when
there
is
a
separate
and
distinct
claims
that
one
or
two
persons
would
intervene
in
the
case,
it
was
really
a
method
of
permissive
joinder.
it's
all
the
old
class
action
rule
was
and
it
was
not
a
class
action
in
the
true
sense.
it
was
not
designed
to
do
a
way
and
to
finally
decide
a
multitude
of
claims.
it
was
not
designed
to
give
as
a
class
action
should
be
to
give
the
small
litigant
a
chance
to
litigate
his
claim
and
i
think
that
was
the
intention
of
the
framers,
i
think
it
is
clearly
expressed
when
they
--
as
i
indicated
before,
the
state
--
the
class
must
be
so
numerous.
well,
obviously
we
know
that
there
can
never
--
that
in
--
from
our
practical
dealing
with
life
that
there
would
not
be
so
many
people
and
very
seldom
it
would
be
so
many
people
that
would
lose
$10,000.00
in
a
transaction
it
would
be
impractical
to
bring
it
into
the
court.
so
the
framers
were
thinking
of
the
small
litigant.
mr.
charles
alan
seigel
that
is
correct.
mr.
charles
alan
seigel
no,
that
is
correct
mr.
justice,
it
was
in
the
old
rule
forever
--
mr.
charles
alan
seigel
that
is
correct
but
the
old
rule
could
not
work
because
the
--
each
person
under
the
old
rule,
they're
being
separate
and
distinct
claims
had
to
have
suffered
a
$10,000.00
jurisdictional
amount
lost
so
the
purpose
of
a
class
action
rule
of
doing
a
way
with
a
multitude
of
litigation
would
not
be
--
would
not
have
been
carried
forth.
mr.
charles
alan
seigel
no.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
charles
alan
seigel
i'll
just
have
very
short
--
two
short
statements.
mr.
charles
alan
seigel
mr.
justice,
members
of
the
court,
i
think
that
question
that
really
brings
this
whole
thing
to
a
point
is
the
question
what
happens
if
there
is
$10,000.01
or
$10,001.00,
does
that
make
it
a
class
action?
well
under
the
theory
of
the
respondents,
although
respondents
suggested
does
here
but
under
the
theory
it
would
not
because
still
for
each
--
under
their
theory,
for
each
member
of
the
class
you
would
have
to
have
$10,000.00
and
as
i
stated
before,
where
we
ever
going
to
find
a
class
action
as
we
think
of
a
class
action
where
there
have
been
so
many
people
that
have
sustained
$10,000.00
lost.
the
amended
rule
would
be
a
complete
futility,
be
a
futile.
the
amount
raised
--
mr.
charles
alan
seigel
well,
mr.
justice
he
--
on
being
questioned
here
by
mr.
justice
marshall,
his
answer
was,
is
that
if
the
petitioner
had
$10,001.00,
that
would
permit
a
class
action.
mr.
charles
alan
seigel
however,
throughout
their
brief,
they
take
the
position
that
there
are
separate
and
distinct
claims
and
that
there
must
be
$10,000.00
for
each
claim.
mr.
charles
alan
seigel
well,
--
bear
with
me
just
one
second
mr.
justice.
here,
they
say
--
well
mr.
justice,
mr.
zemelman
in
behalf
of
the
respondents
cite
the
case
in
united
states
supreme
court
case
of
troy.
mr.
charles
alan
seigel
on
page
13.
mr.
charles
alan
seigel
of
the
respondent's
brief.
and
i
think
this
sets
forth
their
position
that
--
and
this
was
under
the
old
rule
and
under
the
old
court
procedure
of
joinder
when
two
or
more
plaintiffs
having
separate
and
distinct
demands
unite
for
convenience
in
economy
to
a
single
suit,
it
is
essential
that
the
demand
of
each
be
the
requisite
jurisdictional
amount
and
so
--
mr.
charles
alan
seigel
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
but
it's
the
position
of
the
respondent
in
this
case
that
the
rules
of
aggregation
for
joinder
apply
in
the
class
action.
now
under
the
old
rule
23,
it
was
really
no
more
than
a
joinder
action
and
so
in
interpreting
the
amended
rule
23
is
really
the
first
class
action
as
we
think
of
it
that
the
federal
court
has
ever
had.
amend
that
the
old
rule
23
was
no
more
than
a
permissive
joinder
because
when
there
was
separate
distinct
claims
and
common
questions
of
law,
all
it
did
was
give
a
person
having
a
separate
and
distinct
claim
be
right
to
come
into
the
court
and
join
and
any
judgment,
there
would
be
separate
judgments
and
it
would
not
bind
any
other
members
of
the
class.
it
was
not
a
class
action
--
mr.
charles
alan
seigel
mr.
justice,
the
rule
does
not
so
state.
that
was
the
interpretation
that
was
given
by
the
courts
not
by
looking
at
the
rule
or
not
looking
by
any
statute,
by
looking
at
the
old
principles
of
what
was
a
joint
claim
and
what
was
a
true
--
a
common
claim.
there
is
nothing
in
the
rule.
mr.
charles
alan
seigel
well
mr.
justice
that
the
rule
--
mr.
charles
alan
seigel
well,
it's
just
that
has
been
their
position
throughout
the
whole
proceedings
and
i
might
say
this
is
that
mr.
justice,
there
is
nothing
in
the
old
rule
23
that
in
any
way
indicates
or
states
that
the
person
bringing
a
separate
and
distinct
claim
must
have
separate
and
independent
federal
jurisdiction.
mr.
charles
alan
seigel
well,
mr.
justice,
as
our
position
in
this
case
that
when
we
talk
about
jurisdiction,
what
we
are
talking
about
is
the
$10,000.00
limitation
that
was
established
originally
it
was
500
by
the
federal
judiciary
act.
this
was
established
by
congress.
we
are
not
talking
about
jurisdiction
because
there
is
no
statute
at
all
that
tells
how
you
should
compute
that
$10,000.00
amount.
we
are
talking
about
a
method
of
procedure.
mr.
charles
alan
seigel
pardon,
i
didn't
here
you.
mr.
charles
alan
seigel
i
think
that
we
have
--
mr.
charles
alan
seigel
but
i
--
that
is
correct.
now,
the
respondent
is
looking
to
decisions
of
this
court.
now
a
court
cannot
limit
jurisdiction
or
cannot
expand
jurisdiction.
a
rule
cannot
limit
or
expand
jurisdiction
so
we
must
be
talking
about
procedure
because
the
court
cannot
touch
jurisdiction
that
is
set
by
statute.
mr.
charles
alan
seigel
well,
i
assume
the
congress
did
know
the
case
law
but
of
course
there
was
no
mention
as
to
how
computation
should
be
made
but
still
the
court
had
to
look
to
its
procedural
rules
to
find
out
how
the
jurisdictional
amounts
will
be
computed
and
then
that's
we
are
urging
here.
mr.
charles
alan
seigel
that
is
correct.
mr.
charles
alan
seigel
well,
there
at
the
time
when
the
congress
initially
passed
the
jurisdictional
amounts,
there
really
wasn't
any
--
this
is
way
back
in
1789,
there
really
wasn't
any
law
as
far
as
joinder
and
class
actions
--
mr.
charles
alan
seigel
that
is
correct.
but
the
point
is
and
i
know
i
emphasized,
this
is
that
you're
only
talking
about
jurisdiction
when
you
talk
about
raising
or
lowering
the
10,000
a
month.
we
are
not
talking
about
that.
we
say
that
amended
rule
23
has
provided
for
a
procedure
whereby
there
is
a
binding
one
single
judgment
in
a
class
action,
binding
on
each
and
every
member
of
the
class
which
is
not
--
choose
to
withdraw
from
the
class
and
that
in
this
case
that
one
single
action,
one
single
judgment
would
be
a
$1,200.000.00
--
mr.
charles
alan
seigel
mr.
justice,
i
might
say
that
the
--
there
isn't
action
in
the
state
court,
a
corporate
--
traditional
corporate
derivative
action
which
we
do
not
participate
in
and
that
our
position
is
this.
our
action
is
brought
on
behalf
of
the
stockholders,
not
on
behalf
of
the
corporation
for
the
reason
is
that
if
this
$1,200,000.00
will
be
covered
and
would
be
paid
in
to
the
corporation
that
it
would
be
the
wrongdoers
who
now
control,
who
would
be
getting
the
benefit
of
this
premium
that
was
paid
to
them
and
there
are
cases
to
substantiate
our
position.
so
therefore,
we
are
asking
that
the
million
and
our
complaint
specifically
states
that
we
are
asking
judgment
for
a
$1,200,000.00
for
the
members
of
the
class,
that
is
the
judgment
prayed
for.
mr.
charles
alan
seigel
this
is
not
a
derivative
action.
mr.
charles
alan
seigel
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
charles
alan
seigel
yes,
your
honor,
justice.
mr.
justice,
this
is
a
case
that
was
initially
instituted
in
the
eastern
district
of
missouri
by
the
petitioner,
a
diversity
case
brought
under
the
federal
rule
23,
the
class
action
rules
seeking
to
recover
for
herself
and
for
some
4,000
members
of
her
class
a
judgment
in
the
amount
of
$1,200,000.00.
the
petitioner
is
the
owner
of
some
2,000
shares
of
stock
of
the
missouri
union
fidelity
insurance
company.
in
the
petitioner's
complaint,
it
is
alleged
that
the
national
western
life
insurance
company
entered
into
an
agreement
with
the
controlling
members
of
the
board
of
directors
of
missouri
fidelity
union
trust
company,
insurance
company,
whereby
the
national
western
agreed
that
they
would
buy
some
300,000
shares
of
stock
owned
by
the
directors
and
members
of
the
directors
family
for
a
premium
price
of
a
$1,200,000.00
and
by
premium
price
i
mean
$1,200,000.00
over
what
the
stock
was
sell
for
in
the
market
and
the
condition
was,
is
that
these
directors
resign
and
that
--
and
that
is
what
happened.
the
directors
did
resign
on
the
shares
being
purchased
and
the
nominees
and
national
western
were
then
elected
to
control
to
the
board
of
directors
and
were
then
elected
to
control
of
the
executive
committee
and
the
financial
committee.
the
relief
sought
in
the
petition,
the
complaint
was
that
this
$1,200,000.00
should
be
distributed
to
the
shareholders
of
missouri
union
fidelity
because
that
this
was
an
illegal
sale
of
the
officers
of
the
directors
and
it
was
a
breach
of
trust
owed
by
the
directors
to
the
stockholders.
the
respondent
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
taking
the
position
in
the
motion
to
dismiss
that
the
claim
of
each
member
of
the
class
was
a
separate
and
distinct
claim
and
that
in
as
much
as
the
claim,
the
respective
amount
of
the
petitioner's
case
was
only
$8,740.00
that
the
jurisdictional
amount
of
$10,000.00
had
not
been
met.
the
district
judge,
district
court
sustained
this
motion.
this
was
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
certiorari
is
applied
for
and
granted
to
the
court
on
this
matter.
the
sustaining
of
this
motion
to
dismiss
is
what
made
up
the
issues
in
this
case.
the
respondents'
claim
that
under
the
old
rule,
federal
rule
23
and
of
many
cases
decided
before
the
amended
rule
of
federal
rule
23,
is
that
you
could
not
aggregate,
you
cannot
aggregate
separate
and
distinct
claims.
it's
the
position
of
the
petitioner
that
amended
rule,
federal
rule
23
does
awake
completely
with
any
designation
of
separate
distinction
claims
and
that
under
federal
rule
23
there
is
provided
for
one
action
and
one
judgment
finding
on
the
whole
class
except
those
who
want
to
be
--
indicate
that
they
want
to
be
excluded.
there
is
no
such
thing
as
separate
and
distinct
claim,
therefore
aggregation
is
permitted.
now
going
into
a
little
history,
the
united
states
constitution
article
3
says
that
the
judicial
power
should
be
in
one
supreme
court
and
then
such
inferior
courts
as
the
congress
should
then
designate.
the
section
2
of
the
constitution
provides
that
the
judicial
powers
should
extend
to
matters
of
citizens
of
different
states.
now
in
the
judicial
act
of
1789,
there
was
set
forth
by
congress
the
jurisdiction
amount
of
$500.00
for
jurisdiction
in
district
courts.
this
has
now
been
extended
presently
to
$10,000.00.
as
might
be
expected
after
there
was
set
this
jurisdictional
limit,
there
came
up
the
problem
--
there
came
the
problem
as
what
happens
in
joinder
cases
and
what
happens
in
class
action
cases,
how
do
you
compute
to
$10,000.00.
for
the
courts
then
looked,
they
cannot
look
to
statute,
there
was
nothing
in
the
statute
a
term
saying
how
it
should
be
determined.
there's
nothing
in
the
constitution
so
they
then
look
to
their
rules,
the
rules
of
common
law
and
of
equity
practice
as
it
grew
up
as
to
joinder
equity
practice
and
also
the
interpretations
to
the
old
amended
--
old
federal
rule
23
which
really
was
a
codification
of
the
rule,
the
old
rules
of
common
law
joinder
and
of
equity
practice.
and
as
we
go
back
and
to
look
at
the
common
law
rules
of
joinder
class
actions
and
of
equity
practice,
and
as
also
was
--
were
codified
in
federal
rule
23,
we
find
that
there
was
such
terms
used
as
joint
and
common
and
separate
and
distinct
and
the
courts
came
down
with
this
theory.
they
came
down
with
this
theory
by
looking
not
at
the
statutes,
not
the
constitution
but
at
their
own
procedural
rules
and
they
came
with
this
conclusion
that
if
there
was
a
joint
action
and
that
would
be
an
action
for
example
when
there
was
an
interpretation
of
a
trust,
a
raise
that
would
be
binding
and
all
the
parties
plaintiff,
this
was
a
true
class
action
and
therefore
aggregation
should
be
permitted.
but
if
there
was
a
separate
and
distinct
claims,
such
as
the
claims
which
we
admit
under
the
prior
rule
would
be
this
particular
case
that
these
could
not
be
aggregated
because
there
could
be
separate
judgments
and
in
every
respect
under
federal
rule
23,
the
old
federal
rule
23
and
under
the
old
equity
and
common
law
practice,
the
--
even
though
there
was
a
joinder
or
clause
of
class
action
when
there
was
a
separate
distinct
claims,
each
claim
maintained
its
own
identity.
this
joint
and
several
claims
were
called
spurious
claims
and
in
these
claims
the
court
would
not
allow
aggregation
and
again
under
federal
rule
23,
the
old
rule
federal
23
is
that
the
only
effect
of
a
joinder
and
a
class
action
whether
a
separate
or
distinct
claims
was
that
the
--
when
the
person
do
had
a
separate
distinct
claim
could
intervene
in
the
action.
it
was
not
binding
on
any
other
members
of
the
class
unless
the
class
member
actually
intervened
in
the
action
and
the
--
there
could
be
separate
and
distinct
judgments
and
there
could
be
a
judgment
for
plaintiff
and
it
could
be
against
the
plaintiff.
in
19
--
july
of
1967,
amended
rule
23
was
passed
and
basically
the
amended
rule
23
provides,
is
that
when
the
class
is
so
numerous,
they're
being
practical
to
join
all
the
parties
involved
and
there
are
common
questions
of
law
in
fact
common
to
the
class
and
that
their
claims
or
defenses
common
to
the
class
and
that
the
petitioner
will
fairly
represent
the
class
and
that
the
questions
of
law
in
fact
common
to
members
of
the
class
prevail
over
any
question
affecting
individual
members
then
a
class
action
may
be
maintained
and
then
after
--
if
a
judgment
is
entered,
the
rule
specifically
says,
the
judgment
--
does
not
say
the
judgments,
the
judgment
in
such
an
action,
not
in
actions,
shall
describe
the
member
of
this
class
and
shall
be
binding
on
all
members
of
the
class
who
do
not
notify
the
court
after
being
notified
by
the
court
that
the
action
is
pending
that
they
want
to
be
excluded.
so,
as
in
this
particular
case
if
the
petitioner
was
prevailed,
there
would
be
one
judgment
in
the
amount
of
$1,200,000.00
and
which
will
be
binding
on
all
members
of
the
class
except
those
members
who
notified
the
court
that
they
do
not
want
to
be
included
in
the
judgment.
mr.
charles
alan
seigel
mr.
justice,
they
would
be
distributed
to
each
member
of
this
class,
his
respective
share.
mr.
charles
alan
seigel
they
would
have
to
retain
the
right
to
bring
their
own
independent
action
mr.
justice.
they
could
bring
an
independent
action
for
example
in
the
state
court
action
if
they
so
desire.
mr.
charles
alan
seigel
there
could
be,
that's
correct
mr.
justice.
mr.
charles
alan
seigel
that
is
correct.
mr.
charles
alan
seigel
that
is
correct.
mr.
charles
alan
seigel
mr.
justice
the
--
mr.
charles
alan
seigel
they
could
maintain
that
action.
the
--
mr.
charles
alan
seigel
well,
if
they
do
not
have
the
$10,000.00
jurisdictional
amount
involved
between
them,
then
they
would
file
their
suit
in
the
state
court.
mr.
charles
alan
seigel
under
the
class
action
rules,
yes.
mr.
charles
alan
seigel
well,
if
their
claims
are
in
excess
of
$10,000.00,
they
could
bring
it
in
the
federal
court,
if
they
were
not,
they
would
bring
their
claims
in
the
state
court.
mr.
charles
alan
seigel
well,
in
that
case
mr.
justice
that
would
be
a
simple
case
of
joinder
of
two
--
mr.
charles
alan
seigel
--
of
two
plaintiffs
and
that
would
not
fall
under
the
class
action
rule
and
the
old
rules
as
far
as
joinder
would
apply.
mr.
charles
alan
seigel
that
is
correct.
mr.
charles
alan
seigel
well,
under
the
old
rule
that
this
was
strictly
a
joinder
case
mr.
justice,
that
would
be
correct
because
i
want
to
make
it
clear,
is
that
our
position
on
--
that
the
claim
should
be
aggregated
is
really
based
solely
--
mr.
charles
alan
seigel
--
on
amended
rule,
federal
rule
23.
mr.
charles
alan
seigel
and
under
the
case
that
mr.
justice
has
put
forth,
is
that
would
be
just
simply
a
permissive
joinder
--
mr.
charles
alan
seigel
and
i
think
that
we
have
to
look
to
the
old
court
decisions
on
that
and
that
there
would
not
be
aggregation
because
the
sole
basis
of
our
claim
for
aggregation
is
amended
rule
23
which
now
provides
for
one
judgment
finding
of
the
whole
class.
mr.
charles
alan
seigel
in
--
mr.
justice
in
the
case
that
you
mentioned,
there
could
be
--
there
would
be
not
one
judgment,
there
would
be
two
separate
judgments
because
this
thing
in
a
strictly
permissive
joinder
case,
there
is
not
provision
for
a
single
judgment.
there
--
it
would
be
a
judgment
for
each
plaintiff
and
--
mr.
charles
alan
seigel
that
is
correct.
mr.
charles
alan
seigel
that
is
correct,
that
is
correct.
but
i
might
point
this
out
that
theoretically
in
a
permissive
joinder
case,
there
could
be
different
judgments
whereas
in
a
class
action
under
amended
rule
23,
there
cannot
be
different
judgments,
there
is
one
judgment
that
is
binding
on
the
whole
class
and
there
is
only
one
consistent
judgment
that
cannot
be
separate
judgments
or
like
four
or
one
member
of
the
class
against
the
other
because
the
rule
says
that
if
the
claims
or
defenses
are
not
common,
then
there
should
not
be
a
class
action
rule.
so
there
is
no
possibility
of
inconsistent
judgment
and
amended
rule
23.
mr.
charles
alan
seigel
mr.
justice
that
would
be
so
as
long
as
the
--
the
aggregate
amount
of
the
total
claims
of
the
whole
class
was
in
excess
of
the
$10,000.00
jurisdiction.
mr.
charles
alan
seigel
right,
that's
correct.
the
respondents
have
contended
that
we
must
look
to
the
old
rules
as
to
aggregation.
the
old
rules
as
to
what
the
courts
--
the
decisions
what
the
courts
held
that
there
could
not
be
aggregation
if
there
were
separate
distinct
claims.
we
must
look
to
the
old
federal
rule
which
had
this
break
down
and
use
these
terms,
a
carryover
from
the
old
common
law
and
class
actions
of
joint
common
and
several
and
that
as
i
indicated
that
if
it
was
a
joint
claim,
there
could
be
aggregation
but
if
it
were
several,
there
cannot
be.
now,
that
is
what
the
respondents
looked
to
in
support
of
their
position.
but
now
when
the
petitioner
wants
to
look
at
amended
rule
23
to
find
out
that
there
can
be
aggregation
in
the
whole
claims,
the
respondents
now
claim
that
this
is
in
violation
of
rule
82
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
which
says
that
the
federal
rules
cannot
expand
federal
jurisdiction.
i
submit
that
if
the
petitioner
in
seeking
to
justify
aggregation
and
rule
--
under
amended
rule
23
is
in
violation
of
expanding
jurisdiction
then
the
respondents
in
looking
at
the
court's
interpretation
of
its
own
rules,
its
own
common
law
rules,
equity
rules
and
old
rule
federal
23
is
also
in
violation
of
the
restrictions
of
rule
82
which
says
not
only
must
you
not
extend
jurisdiction,
you
might
not
limit
jurisdiction.
otherwise
if
we
are
expanding
jurisdiction
by
looking
on
amended
rule
83,
they
are
limiting
jurisdiction
by
looking
at
the
old
federal
rule
23
and
we're
looking
at
the
court's
decisions
which
were
handed
down
before
the
old
rule
23,
obviously
a
court
cannot
limit
its
own
jurisdiction
but
actually
what
we
are
not
--
we're
not
really
talking
about
jurisdiction.
we
are
talking
about
procedure.
the
amended
rule
23
in
no
way
seeks
to
increase
or
decrease
the
amount
of
the
$10,000.00
jurisdictional
amount.
it
simply
provides
a
procedure
that
where
in
a
class
action
brought
under
amended
rule
23,
there
is
one
binding
judgment
and
this
judgment
is
binding
on
the
whole
class.
and
we
might
say
that
how
is
it
possible
in
a
case
such
as
this
one
when
there
is
one
binding
judgment
on
the
whole
class
which
would
--
could
be
in
amount
of
$1,200,000.00
that
there
is
not
in
controversy,
the
sum
of
$10,000.00.
again,
i
want
to
emphasize
is
that
we
are
talking
about
one
judgment
the
rule
speaks
about
one
judgment
and
one
action.
i've
been
talking
about
theory
and
there
is
a
practical
sensibility
to
the
amended
rule
23.
a
class
action
really
is
--
was
thought
of
and
enacted
and
devised
to
provide
a
form
to
get
rid
of
a
multitude
of
cases,
decide
them
all
in
one
case
and
also
it
was
devised
to
give
a
small
litigant,
a
chance
to
litigate
his
claim
of
the
makers
--
the
rule
recognized
this
when
they
--
in
their
statements,
the
advice
of
committee
notes
that
they
were
doing
their
way
completely
with
these
terms,
joint,
common,
several,
true,
spurious
and
hybrid
actions.
these
were
being
done
away
and
there
was
going
to
be
provided
new
amended
rule
23
would
provide
it
for
only
one
action.
these
terms
were
no
longer
going
to
be
looked
to
and
i
submit
that
if
we
take
the
interpretation
as
urged
by
the
respondent
in
this
case
that
there
would
never
be
a
very
seldom
ever
be
brought
an
action
under
--
excuse
me,
the
amended
class
action
rules.
and
as
for
this
reason,
the
first
requirement
of
amended
rule
23
is
that
the
class
be
so
numerous,
that
it
would
be
impractical
to
bring
them
all
before
the
court.
i
cannot
think
of
any
case
that
i've
read
or
heard
about
and
with
there
was
so
many
people
that
suffered
independent
damages
of
$10,000.00
that
they
could
not
be
brought
before
the
court
and
most
of
the
cases
such
as
the
case
we
are
talking
about,
you
find
persons
who
has
sustained
damages
of
$500.00,
a
thousand
dollars,
in
our
case,
the
petitioner
in
this
case
was
$8,740.00
but
in
very
few
case
if
any
will
you
find
so
many
people
that
would
be
impractical
to
bring
the
court,
each
one
of
them
has
sustained
a
$10,000.00
and
therefore
the
position
urged
by
the
respondent
really
completely
makes
rule
23,
amended
rule
23
a
nullity,
it
will
never
be
used
and
i
suggest
and
urge
this
court
that
the
interpretation
urged
by
the
petitioner
be
adopted.
that
was
the
intention
of
the
framers
of
the
rule
that
small
litigants
haven't
formed
to
litigate
their
claims
and
that
under
the
federal
--
amended
rule
23
that
there
would
be
one
action,
one
judgment
binding
on
all
the
members
of
the
class
that
have
not
chosen
to
be
excluded
and
certainly
in
this
case,
that
amount
would
be
for
an
excess
of
the
$10,000.00
jurisdictional
amount.
mr.
charles
alan
seigel
well
the
--
mr.
charles
alan
seigel
there
--
that's
true.
there
could
be
a
forum
but
i
think
that
the
litigants
are
entitled
to
an
impartial
forum
as
provided
for
--
by
the
diversity
of
the
citizen
--
the
citizenship
of
provisions
of
our
--
of
a
traditional
act
of
the
constitution,
pardon
me.
and
the
mere
fact
that
there
might
be
a
form
in
the
state
court,
does
not
mean
that
there
cannot
be
also
be
a
form
in
the
federal
court
and
i
think
it
was
the
intention
of
the
framers
to
have
a
rule
--
the
state
courts
--
none
that
i
know
have
this
particular
rule.
i
think
it
was
the
intention
of
the
framers
of
amended
rule
23
to
provide
such
a
form
because
it
was
seen
that
under
the
old
rule
is
that
no
class
actions
were
being
brought.
the
only
thing
that
was
happening
was,
is
that
when
there
is
a
separate
and
distinct
claims
that
one
or
two
persons
would
intervene
in
the
case,
it
was
really
a
method
of
permissive
joinder.
it's
all
the
old
class
action
rule
was
and
it
was
not
a
class
action
in
the
true
sense.
it
was
not
designed
to
do
a
way
and
to
finally
decide
a
multitude
of
claims.
it
was
not
designed
to
give
as
a
class
action
should
be
to
give
the
small
litigant
a
chance
to
litigate
his
claim
and
i
think
that
was
the
intention
of
the
framers,
i
think
it
is
clearly
expressed
when
they
--
as
i
indicated
before,
the
state
--
the
class
must
be
so
numerous.
well,
obviously
we
know
that
there
can
never
--
that
in
--
from
our
practical
dealing
with
life
that
there
would
not
be
so
many
people
and
very
seldom
it
would
be
so
many
people
that
would
lose
$10,000.00
in
a
transaction
it
would
be
impractical
to
bring
it
into
the
court.
so
the
framers
were
thinking
of
the
small
litigant.
mr.
charles
alan
seigel
that
is
correct.
mr.
charles
alan
seigel
no,
that
is
correct
mr.
justice,
it
was
in
the
old
rule
forever
--
mr.
charles
alan
seigel
that
is
correct
but
the
old
rule
could
not
work
because
the
--
each
person
under
the
old
rule,
they're
being
separate
and
distinct
claims
had
to
have
suffered
a
$10,000.00
jurisdictional
amount
lost
so
the
purpose
of
a
class
action
rule
of
doing
a
way
with
a
multitude
of
litigation
would
not
be
--
would
not
have
been
carried
forth.
mr.
charles
alan
seigel
no.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
charles
alan
seigel
i'll
just
have
very
short
--
two
short
statements.
mr.
charles
alan
seigel
mr.
justice,
members
of
the
court,
i
think
that
question
that
really
brings
this
whole
thing
to
a
point
is
the
question
what
happens
if
there
is
$10,000.01
or
$10,001.00,
does
that
make
it
a
class
action?
well
under
the
theory
of
the
respondents,
although
respondents
suggested
does
here
but
under
the
theory
it
would
not
because
still
for
each
--
under
their
theory,
for
each
member
of
the
class
you
would
have
to
have
$10,000.00
and
as
i
stated
before,
where
we
ever
going
to
find
a
class
action
as
we
think
of
a
class
action
where
there
have
been
so
many
people
that
have
sustained
$10,000.00
lost.
the
amended
rule
would
be
a
complete
futility,
be
a
futile.
the
amount
raised
--
mr.
charles
alan
seigel
well,
mr.
justice
he
--
on
being
questioned
here
by
mr.
justice
marshall,
his
answer
was,
is
that
if
the
petitioner
had
$10,001.00,
that
would
permit
a
class
action.
mr.
charles
alan
seigel
however,
throughout
their
brief,
they
take
the
position
that
there
are
separate
and
distinct
claims
and
that
there
must
be
$10,000.00
for
each
claim.
mr.
charles
alan
seigel
well,
--
bear
with
me
just
one
second
mr.
justice.
here,
they
say
--
well
mr.
justice,
mr.
zemelman
in
behalf
of
the
respondents
cite
the
case
in
united
states
supreme
court
case
of
troy.
mr.
charles
alan
seigel
on
page
13.
mr.
charles
alan
seigel
of
the
respondent's
brief.
and
i
think
this
sets
forth
their
position
that
--
and
this
was
under
the
old
rule
and
under
the
old
court
procedure
of
joinder
when
two
or
more
plaintiffs
having
separate
and
distinct
demands
unite
for
convenience
in
economy
to
a
single
suit,
it
is
essential
that
the
demand
of
each
be
the
requisite
jurisdictional
amount
and
so
--
mr.
charles
alan
seigel
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
but
it's
the
position
of
the
respondent
in
this
case
that
the
rules
of
aggregation
for
joinder
apply
in
the
class
action.
now
under
the
old
rule
23,
it
was
really
no
more
than
a
joinder
action
and
so
in
interpreting
the
amended
rule
23
is
really
the
first
class
action
as
we
think
of
it
that
the
federal
court
has
ever
had.
amend
that
the
old
rule
23
was
no
more
than
a
permissive
joinder
because
when
there
was
separate
distinct
claims
and
common
questions
of
law,
all
it
did
was
give
a
person
having
a
separate
and
distinct
claim
be
right
to
come
into
the
court
and
join
and
any
judgment,
there
would
be
separate
judgments
and
it
would
not
bind
any
other
members
of
the
class.
it
was
not
a
class
action
--
mr.
charles
alan
seigel
mr.
justice,
the
rule
does
not
so
state.
that
was
the
interpretation
that
was
given
by
the
courts
not
by
looking
at
the
rule
or
not
looking
by
any
statute,
by
looking
at
the
old
principles
of
what
was
a
joint
claim
and
what
was
a
true
--
a
common
claim.
there
is
nothing
in
the
rule.
mr.
charles
alan
seigel
well
mr.
justice
that
the
rule
--
mr.
charles
alan
seigel
well,
it's
just
that
has
been
their
position
throughout
the
whole
proceedings
and
i
might
say
this
is
that
mr.
justice,
there
is
nothing
in
the
old
rule
23
that
in
any
way
indicates
or
states
that
the
person
bringing
a
separate
and
distinct
claim
must
have
separate
and
independent
federal
jurisdiction.
mr.
charles
alan
seigel
well,
mr.
justice,
as
our
position
in
this
case
that
when
we
talk
about
jurisdiction,
what
we
are
talking
about
is
the
$10,000.00
limitation
that
was
established
originally
it
was
500
by
the
federal
judiciary
act.
this
was
established
by
congress.
we
are
not
talking
about
jurisdiction
because
there
is
no
statute
at
all
that
tells
how
you
should
compute
that
$10,000.00
amount.
we
are
talking
about
a
method
of
procedure.
mr.
charles
alan
seigel
pardon,
i
didn't
here
you.
mr.
charles
alan
seigel
i
think
that
we
have
--
mr.
charles
alan
seigel
but
i
--
that
is
correct.
now,
the
respondent
is
looking
to
decisions
of
this
court.
now
a
court
cannot
limit
jurisdiction
or
cannot
expand
jurisdiction.
a
rule
cannot
limit
or
expand
jurisdiction
so
we
must
be
talking
about
procedure
because
the
court
cannot
touch
jurisdiction
that
is
set
by
statute.
mr.
charles
alan
seigel
well,
i
assume
the
congress
did
know
the
case
law
but
of
course
there
was
no
mention
as
to
how
computation
should
be
made
but
still
the
court
had
to
look
to
its
procedural
rules
to
find
out
how
the
jurisdictional
amounts
will
be
computed
and
then
that's
we
are
urging
here.
mr.
charles
alan
seigel
that
is
correct.
mr.
charles
alan
seigel
well,
there
at
the
time
when
the
congress
initially
passed
the
jurisdictional
amounts,
there
really
wasn't
any
--
this
is
way
back
in
1789,
there
really
wasn't
any
law
as
far
as
joinder
and
class
actions
--
mr.
charles
alan
seigel
that
is
correct.
but
the
point
is
and
i
know
i
emphasized,
this
is
that
you're
only
talking
about
jurisdiction
when
you
talk
about
raising
or
lowering
the
10,000
a
month.
we
are
not
talking
about
that.
we
say
that
amended
rule
23
has
provided
for
a
procedure
whereby
there
is
a
binding
one
single
judgment
in
a
class
action,
binding
on
each
and
every
member
of
the
class
which
is
not
--
choose
to
withdraw
from
the
class
and
that
in
this
case
that
one
single
action,
one
single
judgment
would
be
a
$1,200.000.00
--
mr.
charles
alan
seigel
mr.
justice,
i
might
say
that
the
--
there
isn't
action
in
the
state
court,
a
corporate
--
traditional
corporate
derivative
action
which
we
do
not
participate
in
and
that
our
position
is
this.
our
action
is
brought
on
behalf
of
the
stockholders,
not
on
behalf
of
the
corporation
for
the
reason
is
that
if
this
$1,200,000.00
will
be
covered
and
would
be
paid
in
to
the
corporation
that
it
would
be
the
wrongdoers
who
now
control,
who
would
be
getting
the
benefit
of
this
premium
that
was
paid
to
them
and
there
are
cases
to
substantiate
our
position.
so
therefore,
we
are
asking
that
the
million
and
our
complaint
specifically
states
that
we
are
asking
judgment
for
a
$1,200,000.00
for
the
members
of
the
class,
that
is
the
judgment
prayed
for.
mr.
charles
alan
seigel
this
is
not
a
derivative
action.
mr.
charles
alan
seigel
thank
you
very
much.
