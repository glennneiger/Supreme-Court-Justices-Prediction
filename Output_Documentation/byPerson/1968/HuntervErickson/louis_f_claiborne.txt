mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
perhaps
first,
i
should
say
a
word
to
explain
the
presence
of
the
united
states
in
this
case
which
is
perhaps
another
way
of
addressing
myself
to
the
question
whether
the
case
is
moot
or
whether
it's
lost
its
practical
importance
because
of
the
intervening
passage
of
the
state
law
of
ohio
which
mr.
justice
fortas
referred
to
or
the
federal
law
of
both
the
1866
act
that
was
recently
been
indicated
in
jones
and
mayer,
or
the
civil
rights
act
of
1868.
it
is
our
view
that
these
intervening
events
do
not
in
any
technical
sense
make
this
case
moot
because
they
do
not
provide
the
remedy
sought
by
this
particular
plaintiff
in
this
case.
as
mr.
carter
pointed
out,
the
ohio
law
does
not
reach
a
refusal
to
sell
or
to
rent
a
private
dwelling.
it
does
reach
some
discrimination
by
those
engaged
in
lending
or
in
advertising
or
in
furnishing
commercial
services
with
respect
to
the
sale
of
private
housing
but
the
fundamental
complaint
here
that
certain
housing
was
unavailable
to
mrs.
hunter
is
not
a
remedy
which
she
can
obtain
under
the
ohio
law.
as
for
the
new
federal
law
of
1868
law,
it
does
not
as
of
now
provide
any
remedy
with
respect
to
what
i
assume
to
be
a
single
family
house
which
is
what
mrs.
hunter
was
looking
for.
indeed,
it's
not
clear
that
the
new
federal
law
will
ever
provide
a
remedy
against
the
kind
of
discrimination
alleged
here
by
the
realtor.
federal
law
does
or
will
in
a
year
from
now
provide
a
remedy
against
the
realtor
who
misrepresents
the
availability
of
certain
housing
to
a
particular
race
or
class
but
if
he
correctly
represents
the
owner's
desire
not
to
sell
it
may
not
be
a
violation
of
the
federal
act.
the
1866
act
does
cover
the
fundamental
complaint
here,
in
that
it
reaches
all
housing,
indeed
all
property
discriminations
on
the
ground
of
race.
but
it
does
not
furnish
any
administrative
remedy
and
that
it
seems
to
us
is
the
importance
of
this
case
and
of
other
cases
like
this
no
other
law,
neither
the
ohio
law
nor
either
of
the
federal
laws
can
give
mrs.
hunter
what
she
wants.
what
she
wants
is
that
the
akron,
ohio
commission,
the
local
commission
easily
accessible
to
her
on
which
sit
local
leaders
committed
by
their
local
ordinance
to
eliminating
racial
discrimination
in
housing
in
their
community,
shall
act,
shall
investigate
and
if
necessary
shall
institute
legal
proceedings
on
the
other
hand
to
vindicate
her
right
or
right
which
she
has
quite
independently
under
federal
law,
as
well
as
under
this
local
ordinance
of
akron.
this
is
not
an
unimportant
question.
the
availability
of
a
local
remedy
even
today
when
there
is
a
federal
remedy.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
commission
as
i
understand
it
mr.
justice
harlan
was
never
fully
activated
because
this
amendment
to
the
charter
was
passed
relatively
rapidly
after
the
original
housing
ordinance
was
passed.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
there
is
no
commission.
certainly,
by
now
they
wouldn't
be
an
active
commission.
however,
the
commission
is
to
be
appointed
by
the
mayor
of
the
city
and
i
assume
it
could
be
brought
back
into
existence
without
the
delay.
i
don't
think
it's
a
problem
about
reactivating
a
commission
should
this
case
return
for
a
remedy
in
that
respect.
there's
been
a
lot
of
talk
about
local
handling
of
local
problems
and
of
course
everyone
would
agree
that
that's
the
most
desirable,
the
most
salutary
way
of
handling
this
and
other
problems
in
this
area.
no
federal
law
from
washington
not
even
the
federal
courts
sitting
in
the
state
of
ohio
can
afford
the
same
affective
relief
as
can
a
local
commission
administering
its
local
ordinance.
it's
an
involvement
of
the
local
leaders
as
i've
said.
it's
the
local
commitment
of
the
inhabitants
who
have
themselves
passed
the
supplementary
law.
this
is
what
the
federal
civil
rights
act
of
1968
envisaged
that
they
would
be
local
laws,
local
remedies
to
supplement
the
federal
right
and
of
course
that
local
commission
is
more
readily
accessible
to
those
who
were
injured.
it's
also
important
that
the
local
communities
not
seem
to
be
in
conflict
with
the
overriding
federal
law
which
of
course
applies
in
akron
as
everywhere
else.
but
the
appearance
of
conflicts
which
results
from
akron's
having
a
charter
provisions
which
says
to
its
city
council,
you
may
pass
no
law
providing
for
fair
housing
but
the
elimination
of
discrimination
on
the
ground
of
race
in
housing.
when
the
federal
law
forbids
such
discrimination,
it
creates
confusion,
it
seems
to
tell
citizens
of
that
city
that
whereas
washington
that
is
telling
them
you
may
not
discriminate,
their
own
vetoes,
their
own
electorate
is
condoning
it
and
that
i'm
only
saying
that
this
makes
it
important
and
not
moot.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
--
i
should
perhaps
not
have
referred
to
leaders
in
the
sense
of
political
leaders
presumably
the
political
leaders
as
your
honor
points
out
had
in
fact
by
two-thirds
vote
passed
this
legislation.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
which
requires
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
but
now,
nevertheless,
the
city
as
its
charter,
its
most
authentic
law
provides
has
put
itself
on
the
side
of
perpetuating
the
regime
of
laissez
faire
whereby
freedom
to
discriminate
on
any
ground
specifically
on
the
ground
of
race
appears
to
be
condoned.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
now,
that's
not
effective
because
there
is
a
federal
law
which
forbids
it.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
mr.
justice
stewart,
it's
not
as
though
they
were
no
law.
akron
has
not
been
silent
of
the
subject.
it
has
today
in
its
organic
charter
a
provision,
the
only
amendment
of
the
city
charter
of
akron
as
far
as
i
can
tell
from
the
record
which
provides
that
on
this
one
subject
alone,
that
is
discrimination
in
housing
with
respect
to,
on
account
of
race,
religion
or
ethnic
origin.
the
city
council
is
disabled
from
acting
unless
and
until
it
obtains
the
approval
of
the
entire
electorate.
it
seems
to
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
depending
on
the
effect
of
such
a
referendum,
i
think
it
would
present
substantial
question.
i
should
say
that
there
is
a
case
pending
in
this
court
involving
that
exact
question
and
it
may
be
questionable
whether
i
should
speak
to
that
case
rather
than
this
one.
however
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
case
involves
the
city
of
toledo,
ohio.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
holland
versus
--
it's
pending
on
petition
of
certiorari.
but
let
me
point
out
some
differences
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it's
not
only
my
understanding
of
the
argument
mr.
justice
fortas
but
i
entirely
adopt
it
and
approve
it.
i
was
perhaps
moving
too
slowly
and
had
gotten
that
far.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
certainly
agree
mr.
justice
fortas.
perhaps
i
shouldn't
take
on
the
referendum
case.
i
simply
and
to
be
candid
in
answer
to
your
question
didn't
want
to
suggest
that
there
were
no
arguments,
no
arguments
available
here
which
wouldn't
have
some
bearing
on
that
case
as
well.
if
the
referendum
has
the
effect
as
a
practical
matter
or
as
a
legal
matter
as
is
claimed
in
this
other
case
of
disabling
the
council
in
the
indefinite
future
from
then
enacting
any
such
fair
housing
ordinance
and
the
effect
in
so
far
as
placing
a
burden
on
the
victims
of
discrimination
in
obtaining
an
effective
remedy
through
the
political
process
is
exactly
the
same
whether
it's
done
by
a
referendum
disapproval
of
an
existing
ordinance
or
whether
it's
done
as
here
by
an
amendment
to
the
city
charter.
it
is
debated
in
the
other
case
whether
the
referendum
has
this
effect
and
it
does
not
appear
that
if
the
case
of
akron,
the
referendum
of
disapproval
of
this
ordinance
by
a
timely
referendum
would
have
inhibited
the
ouncil
from
re-passing
the
ordinance
at
a
later
term,
that
is
legally
inhibited
the
council
from
re-passing
the
ordinance
in
the
later
term.
but
there
is
also
the
other
difference
which
is
that
disapproval
of
an
ordinance
by
referendum
merely
erases.
it
does
not
put
into
the
organic
law
what
seems
to
be
what
used
on
its
face
a
discriminatory
provision
explicitly
grounded
on
race
and
of
course
would
resort
to
the
referendum
is
available
with
respect
to
all
ordinances,
not
quite
all
ordinances
in
the
case
of
akron.
whereas
here,
we
have
a
tailor
made
provision
dealing
with
only
the
subject
of
fair
housing
which
is
a
plain
discrimination
against
the
beneficiaries
of
such
laws.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that's
right,
mr.
justice
brennan,
though
i
think
that
the
resort
to
the
initiative
procedure
or
to
the
referendum
procedure
with
respect
to
this
ordinance,
previous
ordinance
already
passed
which
is
available
in
a
case
might
have
had
an
injurious
effect
on
the
class
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--
or
the
beneficiaries
but
that
might
be
just
too
bad
because
we
cannot
control
the
political
process
to
that
extent.
whereas
here,
an
instrument
was
fashioned
with
the
purpose
and
effect
of
placing
at
a
very
substantial
disadvantage
or
as
professor
black
has
put
in
his
article
putting
the
life
preserver
out
of
convenient
reach.
that
was
the
purpose
and
effect
of
this
amendment
of
the
city
charter
which
is
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
does.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
not
necessarily.
now,
i
should
point
out
and
it's
--
there
was
--
the
answer
given
was
that
any
ordinance
was
subject
to
referendum,
that's
not
quite
true.
the
toledo
--
the
akron
charter
expressly
forbids
referendum
on
two
important
matters
where
the
people
are
not
to
be
trusted.
one
is
the
question
of
current
appropriations
for
the
running
of
the
city
and
the
other
is
the
appointment
and
removal
of
those
whose
jobs
have
been
secured
by
the
city
council.
it's
interesting
that
when
it
comes
to
those
matters,
referendum
is
not
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
i
wasn't
to
be
entirely
serious
mr.
justice
stewart
but
there
are
some
matters
as
to
which
the
vagaries
of
the
referendum
process
was
intangible.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
perhaps
so.
now,
let
me
just
emphasize
the
thrust
of
our
argument
here.
it
is
that
this
amendment,
the
city
charter
has
the
undeniable
affect
of
prejudicing
the
beneficiaries
of
this
legislature
of
this
type
of
legislation
that
is
really
not
the
main
fold.
it
also
has
the
intended
or
unintended
but
nevertheless
inevitable
effect
of
encouraging
or
at
least
committing
those
who
engage
in
this
discrimination
by
assuring
them
that
the
likelihood
of
the
passage
of
such
an
ordinance
is
more
remote
than
it
was
before
and
that
things
will
remain
as
they
offer
reasonably
long
time.
all
of
this
might
be
beyond
constitutional
challenge
if
it
resulted
from
the
normal
political
process.
here,
it
results
on
the
contrary
from
an
action
which
narrows
not
enlarges
the
avenues
of
political
relief.
we
do
have
here
a
clogging
of
the
political
process.
normally,
legislation
can
be
passed
either
by
the
council
or
by
the
process
of
initiative
or
by
combination
of
both
through
the
submission
to
referendum.
with
respect
to
this
one
area,
the
council
is
not
to
be
trusted
especially
since
they
demonstrated
there
our
willingness
to
pass
this
fair
housing
legislation
by
two
to
three
vote.
therefore,
the
avenue
of
relief
normally
available
through
the
elected
representatives
is
no
longer
available.
that
has
been
shut
off.
the
only
way
in
which
fair
housing
legislation
can
now
be
enacted
accurately
is
through
the
cumbersome
and
quite
unusual
procedure
of
either
initiative
that's
practical
or
theoretical
a
re-passage
of
this
ordinance
and
an
automatic
referendum
thereafter.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
we
of
course
do
not
challenge
or
in
any
way
question
the
desirability
of
obtaining
the
approval
or
the
voice
of
the
electorate
on
any
matter.
we
do
think
that
singling
out
this
particular
matter
indicates
that
this
is
not
a
feeling
by
the
citizenry
of
akron
that
it
ought
to
resort
to
pure
democracy
but
rather
a
tailor-made
device
which
happens
to
work
very
well
because
those
who
were
affected
are
minority
and
their
voice
will
be
more
effectively
ground
out
when
the
unabated
rule
of
majority
is
allowed
to
prevail.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
--
i
suggest
they
can
do
it
by
initiative
or
by
referendum
but
they
cannot
do
it
in
this
way.
this
way
does
carry
with
it
both
some
consequences
and
the
flavor
which
has
practical
impact
of
this
being
an
area
when
neutrality
is
mandated
unless
the
city
is
to
go
forward
and
eliminate
discrimination.
it
has
but
two
choices:
to
combat
discrimination
or
to
remain
scrupulously
neutral
with
respect
to
it.
that
is
very
difficult
to
do
and
yet
and
saying
it
and
yet
speak
on
the
subject
to
remain
scrupulously
neutral
and
not
on
the
other
direction.
it
seems
to
us
here
that
akron
has
said
too
much
to
be
properly
characterized
as
neutral.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
perhaps
first,
i
should
say
a
word
to
explain
the
presence
of
the
united
states
in
this
case
which
is
perhaps
another
way
of
addressing
myself
to
the
question
whether
the
case
is
moot
or
whether
it's
lost
its
practical
importance
because
of
the
intervening
passage
of
the
state
law
of
ohio
which
mr.
justice
fortas
referred
to
or
the
federal
law
of
both
the
1866
act
that
was
recently
been
indicated
in
jones
and
mayer,
or
the
civil
rights
act
of
1868.
it
is
our
view
that
these
intervening
events
do
not
in
any
technical
sense
make
this
case
moot
because
they
do
not
provide
the
remedy
sought
by
this
particular
plaintiff
in
this
case.
as
mr.
carter
pointed
out,
the
ohio
law
does
not
reach
a
refusal
to
sell
or
to
rent
a
private
dwelling.
it
does
reach
some
discrimination
by
those
engaged
in
lending
or
in
advertising
or
in
furnishing
commercial
services
with
respect
to
the
sale
of
private
housing
but
the
fundamental
complaint
here
that
certain
housing
was
unavailable
to
mrs.
hunter
is
not
a
remedy
which
she
can
obtain
under
the
ohio
law.
as
for
the
new
federal
law
of
1868
law,
it
does
not
as
of
now
provide
any
remedy
with
respect
to
what
i
assume
to
be
a
single
family
house
which
is
what
mrs.
hunter
was
looking
for.
indeed,
it's
not
clear
that
the
new
federal
law
will
ever
provide
a
remedy
against
the
kind
of
discrimination
alleged
here
by
the
realtor.
federal
law
does
or
will
in
a
year
from
now
provide
a
remedy
against
the
realtor
who
misrepresents
the
availability
of
certain
housing
to
a
particular
race
or
class
but
if
he
correctly
represents
the
owner's
desire
not
to
sell
it
may
not
be
a
violation
of
the
federal
act.
the
1866
act
does
cover
the
fundamental
complaint
here,
in
that
it
reaches
all
housing,
indeed
all
property
discriminations
on
the
ground
of
race.
but
it
does
not
furnish
any
administrative
remedy
and
that
it
seems
to
us
is
the
importance
of
this
case
and
of
other
cases
like
this
no
other
law,
neither
the
ohio
law
nor
either
of
the
federal
laws
can
give
mrs.
hunter
what
she
wants.
what
she
wants
is
that
the
akron,
ohio
commission,
the
local
commission
easily
accessible
to
her
on
which
sit
local
leaders
committed
by
their
local
ordinance
to
eliminating
racial
discrimination
in
housing
in
their
community,
shall
act,
shall
investigate
and
if
necessary
shall
institute
legal
proceedings
on
the
other
hand
to
vindicate
her
right
or
right
which
she
has
quite
independently
under
federal
law,
as
well
as
under
this
local
ordinance
of
akron.
this
is
not
an
unimportant
question.
the
availability
of
a
local
remedy
even
today
when
there
is
a
federal
remedy.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
commission
as
i
understand
it
mr.
justice
harlan
was
never
fully
activated
because
this
amendment
to
the
charter
was
passed
relatively
rapidly
after
the
original
housing
ordinance
was
passed.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
there
is
no
commission.
certainly,
by
now
they
wouldn't
be
an
active
commission.
however,
the
commission
is
to
be
appointed
by
the
mayor
of
the
city
and
i
assume
it
could
be
brought
back
into
existence
without
the
delay.
i
don't
think
it's
a
problem
about
reactivating
a
commission
should
this
case
return
for
a
remedy
in
that
respect.
there's
been
a
lot
of
talk
about
local
handling
of
local
problems
and
of
course
everyone
would
agree
that
that's
the
most
desirable,
the
most
salutary
way
of
handling
this
and
other
problems
in
this
area.
no
federal
law
from
washington
not
even
the
federal
courts
sitting
in
the
state
of
ohio
can
afford
the
same
affective
relief
as
can
a
local
commission
administering
its
local
ordinance.
it's
an
involvement
of
the
local
leaders
as
i've
said.
it's
the
local
commitment
of
the
inhabitants
who
have
themselves
passed
the
supplementary
law.
this
is
what
the
federal
civil
rights
act
of
1968
envisaged
that
they
would
be
local
laws,
local
remedies
to
supplement
the
federal
right
and
of
course
that
local
commission
is
more
readily
accessible
to
those
who
were
injured.
it's
also
important
that
the
local
communities
not
seem
to
be
in
conflict
with
the
overriding
federal
law
which
of
course
applies
in
akron
as
everywhere
else.
but
the
appearance
of
conflicts
which
results
from
akron's
having
a
charter
provisions
which
says
to
its
city
council,
you
may
pass
no
law
providing
for
fair
housing
but
the
elimination
of
discrimination
on
the
ground
of
race
in
housing.
when
the
federal
law
forbids
such
discrimination,
it
creates
confusion,
it
seems
to
tell
citizens
of
that
city
that
whereas
washington
that
is
telling
them
you
may
not
discriminate,
their
own
vetoes,
their
own
electorate
is
condoning
it
and
that
i'm
only
saying
that
this
makes
it
important
and
not
moot.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
--
i
should
perhaps
not
have
referred
to
leaders
in
the
sense
of
political
leaders
presumably
the
political
leaders
as
your
honor
points
out
had
in
fact
by
two-thirds
vote
passed
this
legislation.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
which
requires
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
but
now,
nevertheless,
the
city
as
its
charter,
its
most
authentic
law
provides
has
put
itself
on
the
side
of
perpetuating
the
regime
of
laissez
faire
whereby
freedom
to
discriminate
on
any
ground
specifically
on
the
ground
of
race
appears
to
be
condoned.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
now,
that's
not
effective
because
there
is
a
federal
law
which
forbids
it.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
mr.
justice
stewart,
it's
not
as
though
they
were
no
law.
akron
has
not
been
silent
of
the
subject.
it
has
today
in
its
organic
charter
a
provision,
the
only
amendment
of
the
city
charter
of
akron
as
far
as
i
can
tell
from
the
record
which
provides
that
on
this
one
subject
alone,
that
is
discrimination
in
housing
with
respect
to,
on
account
of
race,
religion
or
ethnic
origin.
the
city
council
is
disabled
from
acting
unless
and
until
it
obtains
the
approval
of
the
entire
electorate.
it
seems
to
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
depending
on
the
effect
of
such
a
referendum,
i
think
it
would
present
substantial
question.
i
should
say
that
there
is
a
case
pending
in
this
court
involving
that
exact
question
and
it
may
be
questionable
whether
i
should
speak
to
that
case
rather
than
this
one.
however
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
case
involves
the
city
of
toledo,
ohio.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
holland
versus
--
it's
pending
on
petition
of
certiorari.
but
let
me
point
out
some
differences
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it's
not
only
my
understanding
of
the
argument
mr.
justice
fortas
but
i
entirely
adopt
it
and
approve
it.
i
was
perhaps
moving
too
slowly
and
had
gotten
that
far.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
certainly
agree
mr.
justice
fortas.
perhaps
i
shouldn't
take
on
the
referendum
case.
i
simply
and
to
be
candid
in
answer
to
your
question
didn't
want
to
suggest
that
there
were
no
arguments,
no
arguments
available
here
which
wouldn't
have
some
bearing
on
that
case
as
well.
if
the
referendum
has
the
effect
as
a
practical
matter
or
as
a
legal
matter
as
is
claimed
in
this
other
case
of
disabling
the
council
in
the
indefinite
future
from
then
enacting
any
such
fair
housing
ordinance
and
the
effect
in
so
far
as
placing
a
burden
on
the
victims
of
discrimination
in
obtaining
an
effective
remedy
through
the
political
process
is
exactly
the
same
whether
it's
done
by
a
referendum
disapproval
of
an
existing
ordinance
or
whether
it's
done
as
here
by
an
amendment
to
the
city
charter.
it
is
debated
in
the
other
case
whether
the
referendum
has
this
effect
and
it
does
not
appear
that
if
the
case
of
akron,
the
referendum
of
disapproval
of
this
ordinance
by
a
timely
referendum
would
have
inhibited
the
ouncil
from
re-passing
the
ordinance
at
a
later
term,
that
is
legally
inhibited
the
council
from
re-passing
the
ordinance
in
the
later
term.
but
there
is
also
the
other
difference
which
is
that
disapproval
of
an
ordinance
by
referendum
merely
erases.
it
does
not
put
into
the
organic
law
what
seems
to
be
what
used
on
its
face
a
discriminatory
provision
explicitly
grounded
on
race
and
of
course
would
resort
to
the
referendum
is
available
with
respect
to
all
ordinances,
not
quite
all
ordinances
in
the
case
of
akron.
whereas
here,
we
have
a
tailor
made
provision
dealing
with
only
the
subject
of
fair
housing
which
is
a
plain
discrimination
against
the
beneficiaries
of
such
laws.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that's
right,
mr.
justice
brennan,
though
i
think
that
the
resort
to
the
initiative
procedure
or
to
the
referendum
procedure
with
respect
to
this
ordinance,
previous
ordinance
already
passed
which
is
available
in
a
case
might
have
had
an
injurious
effect
on
the
class
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--
or
the
beneficiaries
but
that
might
be
just
too
bad
because
we
cannot
control
the
political
process
to
that
extent.
whereas
here,
an
instrument
was
fashioned
with
the
purpose
and
effect
of
placing
at
a
very
substantial
disadvantage
or
as
professor
black
has
put
in
his
article
putting
the
life
preserver
out
of
convenient
reach.
that
was
the
purpose
and
effect
of
this
amendment
of
the
city
charter
which
is
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
does.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
not
necessarily.
now,
i
should
point
out
and
it's
--
there
was
--
the
answer
given
was
that
any
ordinance
was
subject
to
referendum,
that's
not
quite
true.
the
toledo
--
the
akron
charter
expressly
forbids
referendum
on
two
important
matters
where
the
people
are
not
to
be
trusted.
one
is
the
question
of
current
appropriations
for
the
running
of
the
city
and
the
other
is
the
appointment
and
removal
of
those
whose
jobs
have
been
secured
by
the
city
council.
it's
interesting
that
when
it
comes
to
those
matters,
referendum
is
not
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
i
wasn't
to
be
entirely
serious
mr.
justice
stewart
but
there
are
some
matters
as
to
which
the
vagaries
of
the
referendum
process
was
intangible.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
perhaps
so.
now,
let
me
just
emphasize
the
thrust
of
our
argument
here.
it
is
that
this
amendment,
the
city
charter
has
the
undeniable
affect
of
prejudicing
the
beneficiaries
of
this
legislature
of
this
type
of
legislation
that
is
really
not
the
main
fold.
it
also
has
the
intended
or
unintended
but
nevertheless
inevitable
effect
of
encouraging
or
at
least
committing
those
who
engage
in
this
discrimination
by
assuring
them
that
the
likelihood
of
the
passage
of
such
an
ordinance
is
more
remote
than
it
was
before
and
that
things
will
remain
as
they
offer
reasonably
long
time.
all
of
this
might
be
beyond
constitutional
challenge
if
it
resulted
from
the
normal
political
process.
here,
it
results
on
the
contrary
from
an
action
which
narrows
not
enlarges
the
avenues
of
political
relief.
we
do
have
here
a
clogging
of
the
political
process.
normally,
legislation
can
be
passed
either
by
the
council
or
by
the
process
of
initiative
or
by
combination
of
both
through
the
submission
to
referendum.
with
respect
to
this
one
area,
the
council
is
not
to
be
trusted
especially
since
they
demonstrated
there
our
willingness
to
pass
this
fair
housing
legislation
by
two
to
three
vote.
therefore,
the
avenue
of
relief
normally
available
through
the
elected
representatives
is
no
longer
available.
that
has
been
shut
off.
the
only
way
in
which
fair
housing
legislation
can
now
be
enacted
accurately
is
through
the
cumbersome
and
quite
unusual
procedure
of
either
initiative
that's
practical
or
theoretical
a
re-passage
of
this
ordinance
and
an
automatic
referendum
thereafter.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
we
of
course
do
not
challenge
or
in
any
way
question
the
desirability
of
obtaining
the
approval
or
the
voice
of
the
electorate
on
any
matter.
we
do
think
that
singling
out
this
particular
matter
indicates
that
this
is
not
a
feeling
by
the
citizenry
of
akron
that
it
ought
to
resort
to
pure
democracy
but
rather
a
tailor-made
device
which
happens
to
work
very
well
because
those
who
were
affected
are
minority
and
their
voice
will
be
more
effectively
ground
out
when
the
unabated
rule
of
majority
is
allowed
to
prevail.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
--
i
suggest
they
can
do
it
by
initiative
or
by
referendum
but
they
cannot
do
it
in
this
way.
this
way
does
carry
with
it
both
some
consequences
and
the
flavor
which
has
practical
impact
of
this
being
an
area
when
neutrality
is
mandated
unless
the
city
is
to
go
forward
and
eliminate
discrimination.
it
has
but
two
choices:
to
combat
discrimination
or
to
remain
scrupulously
neutral
with
respect
to
it.
that
is
very
difficult
to
do
and
yet
and
saying
it
and
yet
speak
on
the
subject
to
remain
scrupulously
neutral
and
not
on
the
other
direction.
it
seems
to
us
here
that
akron
has
said
too
much
to
be
properly
characterized
as
neutral.
