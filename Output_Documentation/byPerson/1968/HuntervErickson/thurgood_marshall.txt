justice
thurgood
marshall
but
don't
we
also
--
don't
we
also
have
to
take
consideration
to
the
atmosphere
that
this
was
aimed
at
the
specific
fair
housing
ordinance?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
is
that
when
you
decided
to
pass
137?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
was
it
passed?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
wasn't
it
subject
to
initiative
and
referendum
of
the
ordinance,
the
original
fair
housing
ordinance?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
could
be
attacked
by
initiative
and
referendum
then?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
it
could
be
attacked
by
initiative.
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
other
words,
you
could
do
one
or
two
things.
you
could
attack
it
by
initiative
which
will
be
a
little
bit
difficult
or
you
could
amend
the
charter
which
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
wouldn't
be
difficult.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
you
took
the
easy
way.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
if
it
benefited
mrs.
hunter,
why
is
she
here
complaining?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
does
the
state
law
covers
this
complaint.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
section
of
the
state
law?
justice
thurgood
marshall
where
is
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
page
11.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
it
print,
publish,
circulate
etcetera,
etcetera,
etcetera.
i
don't
see
anything
in
the
complaint
about
printing
or
circulating.
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
--
would
i
be
safe
in
saying
that
if
there
is
a
question
as
to
whether
that
the
state
law
covers
this?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no
but
i
mean,
that
it's
covered
by
the
state
law.
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
think
there's
some
question
and
it's
not
covered
by
the
state
law?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
recognize
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
there
is
not
question
that
that
complaint
would
come
before
the
commission
if
the
commission
had
been
in
existence
and
if
137
had
not
been
adopted.
justice
thurgood
marshall
no
question.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
the
commission
might
have,
since
you
say
that
such
a
wonderful
atmosphere
in
akron,
couldn't
the
commission
have
talked
to
the
seller
and
the
realtor
and
explained,
you
shouldn't
treat
this
woman
this
way
and
be
nice
to
her
and
it
could
have
all
been
settled,
could
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
it
couldn't
be
settled
once
137
was
passed.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
say,
you
helped
in
the
situation.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
say
you
helped
in
the
situation.
i've
taken
away
one
of
the
evidence
as
you
were
helping
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
am
i
correct
that
we
already
have
fair
housing
enacted?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
said
at
this
time,
we
already
have
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
up
until
it
was
suspended,
you
did
have
it
and
so
you
helped
by
taking
it
away.
that's
where
you
lose
me.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
would
also
assume
that
the
ordinance
that
was
passed
would
become
effective.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
more
it
was
accomplished
other
than
that
under
your
argument
that
akron
save
the
money
of
the
commission?
what
else
did
you
say?
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
akron.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
it
in
operation
now?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
would
it
handle
this
complaint?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i'm
going
to
let
you
interpret
your
own
law
but
i
would
feel
much
better
if
i
were
an
ordinary
citizen
if
i
had
three
protections
than
if
i
had
two.
justice
thurgood
marshall
these
other
communities
are
not
before
us.
justice
thurgood
marshall
am
i
correct?
the
only
community
is
akron.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
akron
had
a
fair
housing
ordinance
and
that's
the
case
we
are
deciding.
now,
if
you
made
it
easier
for
cleveland
and
all
the
other
cities,
that
wouldn't
affect
akron
as
i
see
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
i
read
this
in

if

137
is

if,
and
that's
the
point
that's
before
this
court
right
now,
is
it
valid
or
not?
isn't
that
the
issue?
justice
thurgood
marshall
wouldn't
you
assume
that
utility
is
better
shaped
financially
to
get
a
referendum
than
a
property
owner?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
don't
we
also
