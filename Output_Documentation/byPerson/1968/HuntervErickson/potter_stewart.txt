justice
potter
stewart
mr.
carter,
as
i
had
understood
your
argument,
it
would
--
you
would
be
making
substantially
the
same
attack
on
section
137
whether
or
not
there
had
previously
been
any
fair
housing
legislation
enacted,
would
you
not?
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
so.
alright,
so
i
understand
your
argument.
justice
potter
stewart
without
a
housing
history.
justice
potter
stewart
but
that
really
doesn't
affect
the
--
your
basic
constitutional
attack
on
137,
does
it?
justice
potter
stewart
as
i
understand
your
argument,
it's
really
a
different
issue.
this
is
isn't
reitman
against
mulkey.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
--
justice
potter
stewart
four
members
of
the
court
dissented
reitman
against
mulkey
and
it
may
be
that
if
your
argument
had
addressed
itself
to
the
point
that
this
may
be
a
different
case,
it
might
help
you.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
carter,
do
i
understand
correctly
that
the
akron
charter
also
provides
that
before
any
tax
ordinance
can
be
enacted
that
there
has
to
be
a
vote
of
the
people?
justice
potter
stewart
you
raise
it.
you
raise
it
in
your
brief
by
saying
that
there
is
no
other
kind
of
legislation
that's
requires
this
sort
of
a
vote
and
they
respond
by
saying
you're
mistaken
that
the
tax
legislation
does
require.
justice
potter
stewart
am
i
also
right
in
my
understanding
mr.
carter
that
any
ordinance
passed
by
the
city
council
of
akron
unless
it's
an
emergency
ordinance
which
requires
more
than
a
simple
majority
but
that
any
ordinance
passed
is
subject
to
a
referendum?
justice
potter
stewart
that
does
not
have
an
emergency
clause.
justice
potter
stewart
but
anybody
can
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
the
adequate
number
of
people
can.
justice
potter
stewart
what
part
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
were
you
relying
upon,
the
equal
protection
clause?
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
understand
this
argument
at
all.
no
leaders
in
akron
are
telling
anybody
else,
and
these
are
the
voters
of
akron.
the
council
has
passed
this
legislation.
justice
potter
stewart
it
passed
it
as
an
emergency
ordinance.
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
not
even
subject
to
referendum.
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
this
is
--
i
don't
understand
how
could
you
say
but
it
appears
to
be
condoned
when
it
merely
--
the
charter
merely
provides
that
any
legislation
shall
be
subject
to
most
democratic
process
of
them
all
but
not
representative
democracy
but
pure
democracy.
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
people
are
the
motivation
behind
that
because
the
people
are
not
to
be
trusted
and
i
don't
think
you
do
mr.
claiborne,
neither
that
you
can
think
about
it.
justice
potter
stewart
the
first
area
you
gave
involves
the
necessity
for
a
promise
in
certitude
and
the
second
area,
it's
a
non-legislative
act.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
you're
in
distinguished
company
mr.
vinopal,
i
think
in
--
by
the
justices
of
this
court
yesterday
in
a
very
analogous
situation
pointed
out
that
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
petitioner
had
moved
away
from
arkansas
and
relied
on
the
newspaper
article.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
took
7%
to
put
it
on
the
ballot?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
council
did.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
just
let
me,
just
so
that
i
may
understand
what
happened
here.
the
council
enacted
the
fair
housing
ordinance
then
few
weeks
later,
an
amendment
thereto.
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
you
are
telling
us
that
and
passed
each
as
an
emergency
ordinance
which
may
each
not
subject
to
a
referendum.
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
you're
saying
that
council
thereafter
submitted
that
the
voters
of
section
137
as
an
amendment
to
the
akron
city
charter?
justice
potter
stewart
you
confused
me.
justice
potter
stewart
right,
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
and
what
percentage
of
the
registered
voters
--?
justice
potter
stewart
7%,
that's
what
i
thought.
justice
potter
stewart
what
is
the
--
since
i've
already
interrupted
you,
what
is
the
population
of
akron
and
what
is
the
usual,
the
average
number
of
registered
voters
in
an
election?
justice
potter
stewart
population
is
about
300,000?
justice
potter
stewart
what
percentage
is
the
population
of
negro
approximately?
justice
potter
stewart
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
not
your
position
that
the
state
law
replaces
this
because
as
a
matter
of
ohio
law,
that
doesn't
happen.
any
city,
any
home
rule
city
can
have
an
ordinance
so
long
as
it's
not
with
conflict
with
state
law
and
then
neither
one
of
the
other
supersedes
or
preempts
the
other.
each
is
a
viable
law,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
never
your
position
that
the
relief
asked
for
by
the
plaintiff
in
this
case
is
now
provided
by
state
law.
justice
potter
stewart
because
it
could
have
had
quite
the
same
lawsuit
but
you
would
have
exactly
the
same
constitutional
argument.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
carter,
as
i
had

argument,
it
