mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court,
counsel.
our
position
here
has
three
phases.
i'm
briefly
going
to
touch
on
the
subject
of
mootness,
then
i'm
going
to
talk
about
where
we
stand
with
respect
to
reitman
and
then
i
intend
to
talk
some
about
the
classification.
now,
with
respect
to
mootness,
it
seems
to
me
to
start
with
and
unless
my
friends
on
the
other
side
here
feel
that
the
people
of
akron
will
refuse
to
obey
the
state
or
the
federal
law
that
if
that's
their
argument
then
perhaps
we
shouldn't
be
here
at
all
but
i
don't
think
akron
are
that
kind
of
people.
they
obey
the
state
and
federal
law.
now,
as
to
this
particular
specific
complaint,
both
of
the
state
and
the
federal
law
do
cover
it
because
if
you
will
observe
my
appendix
b
in
my
brief,
this
is
a
complaint
relating
to
the
activities
of
a
real
estate
agent
and
that
is
covered,
that
proposition
is
covered
by
both
of
the
laws.
that
was
really
the
basic
purpose
in
the
sense
as
i
see
it
for
the
state
and
federal
law.
and
along
that
line,
i
begin
to
thinking
a
little
bit
about
it
and
i
look
in
the
sunday
classification
ads,
just
the
sunday
before
i
came
down
here
as
to
advertisements
with
respect
to
the
sale
and
rental
of
real
estate
and
i
was
amazed
to
find
that
of
some
close
to
500
listings,
448
of
them
were
listings
by
real
estate
people
and
only
15
or
20
were
listings
by
individuals.
in
my
own
observation
is
that
my
travels
through
the
city
of
akron,
i
have
yet
to
see
a
sign
where
like
it
used
to
be
alvin
vinopal
wants
to
sell
his
house.
it's
--
this
is
relates
the
regulation
of
a
business,
a
vast
business,
namely
the
real
estate
business
as
well
as
the
banking
business
in
certain
areas
as
i
will
come
to.
now,
the
other
aspect
of
the
question
of
the
mootness
here
is
that
nellie
hunter
anyway
would
hardly
be
involved
in
this
complaint
to
find
a
house
because
she's
now
living
in
chicago.
and
the
other
aspect
about
the
fact
that
we
have
the
state
and
the
federal
law
as
well
as
the
jones
doctrine
under
the
state
and
federal
act,
the
ultimate
complaint
of
a
commission
whatever
may
be
ultimately
ends
up
in
the
common
pleas
court
of
the
county
where
the
individuals
are
located
if
they
have
the
state
law
while
the
state
can
take
over
if
they
do
or
the
city
can
take
over.
and
so
you
get
right
--
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
well,
i'll
grant
you.
it
doesn't
show
there,
i'm
referring
to
a
newspaper
article
about
the
subject
in
discussing
that
counsel.
it
isn't
in
the
record.
i
would
say
that
but
a
reason
this
newspaper
article,
this
subject
has
been
covered
quite
--
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
sorry,
i
didn't
mean
to
--
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
thank
you.
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
no
intention
to
offend
the
court
or
counsel.
i
noticed
that
it
is
seems
the
--
in
these
cases
of
this
area
that
the
courts
have
very
little
record
come
up
here
and
there
is
a
lot
of
assumptions
are
made
about
what
was
before
the
court.
a
--
another
aspect
of
mootness
is
two
that
akron
is
surrounded
by
what
we
would
five
or
six
bedroom
communities
which
really
have
no
law
on
the
subject
and
these
real
estate
people
i
suppose
is,
this
court
certainly
i
would
assume
and
i
hope
the
court
would
assume
that
these
real
estate
dealers
involved
in
a
vast
metropolitan
area
like
that
have
office
and
in
fact
they
do
in
just
those
separate
communities
and
their
activities
relate
to
properties
only
in
those
communities
and
the
akron
law
wouldn't
cover
that
subject
at
all.
now,
as
a
side
issue
to
why
i
think
that
really
the
place
for
this
type
of
law
is
with
the
state
is
again
really
real
estate
business,
the
activity
of
dealing
and
if
you
will
observe
the
ordinance
and
even
the
state
act,
the
ordinance,
any
person
to
whom
an
application
is
made
for
a
financial
assistance
for
the
acquisition,
construction,
rehabilitation,
repair,
or
maintenance
of
any
housing.
now,
that
certainly
is
a
subject
which
is
a
regulatory
matter
involving
real
estate
people
and
banking
people
and
where
real
estate
people
and
banking
people
are
regulated
by
state
law,
i
think
that
the
state
law
is
the
place
for
this
particular
type
of
regulatory
law.
and
that
the
state
law
does
cover
the
activities
of
real
estate
agents.
and
in
fact,
the
matter
i'm
coming
to
now
deal
specifically
with
that.
i
want
to
talk
about
the
reitman
theory
and
the
background
in
this
particular
case.
now,
again
justice
fortas
so
that
i
want
to
be
fair
here
in
the
record
talking
about
background,
i'm
referring
to
a
document
which
my
adversaries
have
quoted
on
both
of
their
briefs,
discrimination
on
housing
in
ohio
and
i'm
sure
the
courts
of
the
state
of
ohio
must
have
had
this
before
them
although
there's
nothing
in
any
of
the
opinions
relating
to
it
but
discrimination
in
ohio
subject
got
statewide
by
virtue
of
this
report
of
the
civil
rights
commission.
now,
that
was
in
january
of
1963
and
then
a
bill
was
introduced
by
the
month
after
that
in
1963
and
that
bill
died
as
the
same
goes
in
june
of
1963
it
was
indefinitely
postponed.
but
all
along
i
feel
to
the
--
and
the
environment
was
that
the
state
was
talking
about
fair
housing
discrimination
in
ohio,
so
the
next
thing
that
happened
we
come
along
then
to
july
of
1964
in
akron
then
passes
the
fair
housing
ordinance.
but
prior
to
that,
there
was
in
the
courts
of
the
state
of
ohio
commencing
in
1963
the
case
of
porter
versus
oberlin
which
is
cited
in
one
of
the
briefs
here
wherein
the
city
of
oberlin
had
a
fair
housing
ordinance
and
it
was
attacked
as
being
unconstitutional
and
in
fact,
the
state
court
of
ohio
did
declare
that
particular
ordinance
to
be
unconstitutional,
the
enforcement
portion
of
it
stating
that
here
was
the
attempt
of
a
municipality
to
set
up
in
the
sense
of
court
and
that
courts
only
could
be
created,
particular
municipal
courts
could
only
be
created
by
the
general
legislator
of
the
state
of
ohio
and
that
therefore
since
this
commission
was
doing
something
in
the
nature
of
a
judicial
function
that
was
unconstitutional.
however,
i
do
want
to
say
though
in
fairness
that
when
the
matter
came
up
in
our
case,
the
akron
case,
the
status
of
it
was
it
was
raised
again
and
in
the
akron
case,
the
judge
who
wrote
the
opinion
when
our
case
was
before
them
on
the
demur
level
said
that
the
akron
officials
had
no
standing
to
appeal
that
case
and
then
several
of
the
judges
said
that,
well,
in
view
of
the
fact
that
this
court
and
as
was
formally
constituted
held
that
the
enforcement
section
of
that
fair
housing
ordinance
was
unconstitutional
we
would
have
to
go
along
with
it.
but
now
the
consistency
of
the
court
had
changed
and
we
probably
wouldn't
do
it.
but
the
judgment
in
that
court
only
stood
for
the
fact
that
the
city
of
akron's
officials
could
not
challenge
the
constitutional
question.
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
that
wasn't
decided
your
honor
until
march
of
1965
so
we
passed
137
in
august
of
1964
right
within
25
days
after
the
fair
housing
ordinance
went
on.
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
well,
my
own
judgment
as
to
why
i
think
it
was
passed
is
first
of
all,
we
start
with
a
proposition
that
we
don't
have
to
have
fair
housing
ordinance
in
akron,
that's
number
one.
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
if
fair
housing
ordinance
was
passed
as
an
emergency
ordinance
so
that
would
remove
--
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
no,
it
have
to
be
attacked
by
initiative.
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
well,
--
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
yes.
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
which
we
did.
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
well,
in
a
sense
i
think
we've
been
afforded
the
proponents
of
fair
housing
when
i
come
to
that,
i'll
tell
you
why.
now,
the
initiative
of
course
would
be
to
start
a
new
law
or
to
repeal.
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
well,
because
i
--
well,
benefited
her
in
the
political
process
that
were
involved
in
this
particular
activity,
that's
what
i
mean
and
i
will
come
to
that.
well
--
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
yes.
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
that's
in
the
record,
your
honor.
yes.
it's
in
the
--
not
in
the
printed
record
but
it's
in
the
original
record.
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
well,
it's
in
there
and
by
the
way,
there
are
certain,
one
or
two
sections
of
the
charter
which
i
intend
to
refer
to
which
are
not
in
the
printed
record
but
they
are
in
the
original
record
copies
of
which
were
furnished
to
state
court
by
our
office,
i
know.
well,
of
course,
then
we
come
along
as
i
say
to
64
when
the
fair
housing
ordinance
was
passed
and
the
charter
amendment.
immediately
right
thereafter,
and
of
course
initiative
at
that
time
would
have
required
naturally
10%
of
the
voters
to
initiate
a
repeal
of
fair
housing
which
you
would
call
it
but
they
chose
the
other.
then
now
--
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
no,
you
see
we
have
a
procedure
where
the
council
themselves
put
it
on
the
ballot.
it
wasn't
required
to
go
to
the
--
to
put
this
charter
amendment
on
the
ballot
at
all.
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
yes.
by
section
36,
council
is
permitted
--
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
--
to
put
all
ordinances
that
they
--
any
charter
amendments
which
they
desire
on
the
ballot
themselves.
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
yes.
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
yes.
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
oh,
i'm
sorry.
maybe
i
am
confused
about
that.
i
meant
--
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
yes,
i'm
sorry.
no.
there
was
this
petition
to
amend
the
charter
as
an
initiative
petition.
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
yes.
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
7%.
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
yes.
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
the
county
voters
are
200,000.
i
think
the
city
voters
are
somewhere
on
150
to
170,000.
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
yes,
300,000
or
somewhere
at
350.
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
i
think
we
have
11%.
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
well,
then
we
come
along
to
january
of
1965
at
which
time
nellie
hunter
filed
this
complaint
and
following
that,
there
had
been
again
activity
instituted
in
the
state
legislator
whereby
in
march
of
1965,
the
state
fair
housing
bill
was
enacted
and
i
think
just
as
a
casual
personal
observation
as
to
why
it
didn't
get
enacted
in
1963
is
because
someone
who
has
hazily
done
after
this
report
and
someone
wanted
to
put
it
in
with
health
welfare
and
morals
in
that
part
of
the
code
and
it
was
batched
up
and
so
it
come
back
the
next
time
that
the
legislator
met
and
they
passed
it
quite
readily
under
the
civil
rights
commission
section.
so,
as
i
say
as
to
what
the
environment
in
the
background
then
of
fair
housing
was
really
around
the
time
when
this
took
place
was
namely
that
it
was
already
started
in
the
state
and
that
i
would
presume
someone
would
feel,
must
have
felt
that
after
all
perhaps
the
place
like
i've
just
said
here,
the
place
to
regulate
this
thing
would
be
statewide
and
that
first
and
above
all,
we
don't
have
to
have
one
in
akron
anyway.
there
are
some,
there
ought
to
be
some
place
when
you
could
maintain
that
particular
position,
it
would
seem
to
me.
now,
as
to
what
the
impact
of
this
particular
amendment
had
for
instance
on
mrs.
hunter,
it
seems
to
me
although
i
don't
want
to
be
unfair
in
mentioning
where
she
now
resides
but
as
to
her
it
would
be
none.
now,
as
to
others
generally,
the
only
time
that
there
would've
been
any
possibility
that
their
rights
were
infringed
would
be
from
the
period
of
july
of
1964
until
october
of
1965
when
we
had
the
state
law
because
we
then
have
the
state
law
covering
pretty
much
a
subject.
although,
i
--
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
your
honor,
i
--
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
on
page
13
of
my
brief,
i
have
it
set
out.
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
yes.
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
now,
i
do
want
to
say
that
the
state
law
doesn't
cover
the
sale
and
rental
of
private
property
between
and
a
and
b.
i
will
--
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
yes,
in
my
opinion,
it
certainly
does.
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
that
would
be
section
--
under
4112.02.
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
page
11
of
my
brief.
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
yes.
there
is
the
section
6,
print,
publish,
circulate
any
statement
or
advertising
relating
to
the
sale,
transfer,
so
on,
so
forth
of
personal
residence.
the
whole
tenor
of
the
--
that
portion
of
the
act
seems
to
me
relates
to
the
regulation
of
the
activities
of
real
estate
people
those
dealing
in
this
business.
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
well,
from
the
complaint
that
i
gather,
there
was
a
circulated
and
implied
that
there
were
certain
properties
for
sale
and
then
when
it
come
time
to
show
with
this
lady,
they
were
--
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
i
--
i'm
not
doubtful
about
it.
i
think
if
it
was
a
complaint
about
that
alvin
vinopal
refused
to
sell
somebody
their
house,
i
think
that
would
be
very
serious
it
wouldn't
apply
but
i
don't
think
under
this
--
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
i
think
it
does,
her
complaint.
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
no.
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
no,
i
do
not.
i
think
these
particular
paragraphs
were
sufficient
to
cover
that
particular
complaint.
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
no,
of
course,
the
state
court
of
course
all
we
dealt
with
there
is
whether
or
not
the
state
court
had
a
right
that
this
a
regulation
and
that
the
state
court
had
--
that
the
people
of
akron
had
the
right
to
vote.
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
yes.
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
well,
in
this
case,
the
question
of
that
problem
never
was
raised
in
the
state
court.
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
no,
i
don't
think.
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
yes.
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
yes.
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
that's
right.
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
say
what?
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
well,
on
the
basis
of
the
fact
that
we
did
not
have
to
have
a
fair
housing
ordinance
in
akron
that
we
have
adequate
remedies
namely
by
the
state
law
and
now
the
federal
law.
at
the
time
of
course
that
she
filed
a
complaint,
there
was
no
federal
law
of
course.
however,
there
was
the
federal
law
with
respect
to
the
private
individual's
sale
of
the
property
and
there
were
those
remedies.
what
i'm
coming
to
about
that
we
helped
or
that
the
situation
was
a
benefit
in
this
respect
as
to
the
matter
of
the
burdens
that
are
placed
upon
people
in
this
particular
situation.
now,
i
read
a
vast
--
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
alright.
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
yes.
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
yes,
sir.
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
yes,
sir.
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
that's
right
but
that
isn't
the
case
we
have
here.
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
yes.
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
well,
merely
on
the
basis
of
a
statement
of
some
real
estate
agent,
it
would
be
arguable,
yes.
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
but
not
in
her
specific
private
dealing
with
any
private
individual,
it
wouldn't
be.
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
i
got
into
the
question
here
of
what
barriers
are
placed
in
the
path
of
these
people
who
wanted
this
particular
ordinance
and
i
have
read
a
stack
of
cases
i
guess
this
high
and
right
now,
i
would
say
they're
all
piled
on
the
floor
of
my
mind
and
i
couldn't
sort
anything
up
and
tell
which
or
any
of
them
ought
to
be
catalogued
but
i
drafted
a
little
statement
here
which
i
thought
was
in
the
sense
the
rule
would
apply
here
as
to
whether
or
not
there
had
been
unreasonable
barriers
placed
in
the
way
for
these
people
to
accomplish
what
they
want
and
i
think
we
go
back
basically
to
the
proposition
that
this
really
is
a
political
duel
or
a
political
competition.
someone
wanted
fair
housing
and
someone
didn't
want
fair
housing.
now,
as
i
see
it,
in
a
political
duel
between
those
who
want
a
certain
regulation
and
between
those
who
oppose
it
if
the
state
or
the
city
in
this
particular
case
--
the
city
or
the
state
in
this
particular
case
may
not
place
in
the
way
of
those
who
desire
it
any
barriers
which
without
the
state
or
here
the
city's
total
political
system
taken
as
a
whole
any
barriers
which
are
especially
difficult
of
surmounting
by
comparison
with
those
barriers
that
normally
stand
in
the
way
are
those
who
wish
to
use
the
political
process
to
get
what
they
want.
now,
in
coming
to
the
answer
to
--
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
well,
i
would
say
that
i'd
have
to
grant
that
certainly
those
people
have
the
right
to
their
constitutional
rights
and
it
would
have
to
fit
in
whatever
process
the
city
or
the
state
involved,
included,
would
have
to
be
rights
that
are
allowed
and
permitted
under
the
federal
constitution.
of
course,
that
would
be
basic
in
this
assumption
here.
now,
so
i
say
that
the
fact
about
the
way
this
particular
charter
amendment
ended
up
was
that
it's
easier
for
those
who
desire
to
get
fair
housing
with
it
than
it
was
before
because
i'm
sure
this
court
can
conceive
and
i
certainly
do
of
city
council's
right
in
our
own,
my
own
area
who
wouldn't
pass
fair
housing.
so,
therefore
what
are
they
going
to
have
to
do
with
those
who
want
it?
they're
going
to
have
it
get
referred.
those
who
would
want
to
have
it
eliminated;
they
will
have
to
use
the
process
of
referendum.
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
yes.
no,
we
do
not
have
it.
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
well,
no
because
in
the
state
court
of
ohio
says
that
we
did
not
because
it
was
suspended.
there
was
no
fair
housing
law
--
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
well,
until
that
the
ordinance
become
effective,
your
honor,
it
seems
to
me
we
wouldn't
have
it.
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
well,
again
getting
back
to
the
total
procedures
which
are
permissible
--
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
well,
--
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
well,
because
i
think
the
state
commission
was
far
better
equipped
to
handle
the
complaint,
that's
another
thing.
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
yes,
it's
in
operation
now
and
real
estate
people
are
regulated
by
the
state.
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
oh,
yes.
it's
going
to
be
my
judgment
that
it
would.
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
well,
there
are
those
who
feel
we
have
too
many
laws
overlapping
as
they
are
and
my
own
judgment
is
that
since
this
is
a
total
problem
that
we
ought
to
regulate
statewide
that
ought
to
be
done
that
way
because
as
i
just
said
there
are
many
of
this
municipalities
in
akron
who
aren't
going
to
have,
do
not
have
one
and
never
will
have
one
in
my
own
humble
judgment
and
so
--
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
well,
preempt
--
the
state
is
now
in
and
i'm
sure
that
if
akron
tried
to
do
anything
that
the
state
found
offensive
to
the
way
it
was
handling
then
that
would
be
held
improper.
i
think
the
cities
could
have
--
the
cities
are
allowed
to
have
laws
which
are
not
in
conflict
with
the
general
laws
so
if
we
had
some
--
if
it
didn't
disturb
what
the
states
got
it
wouldn't
--
there
would
be
no
problem.
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
yes.
of
course,
my
position
that
since
--
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
that
--
that's
my
position
that
there
was
a
state
law
which
provides
the
relief
that
she
could
had.
by
the
way,
this
was
a
mandamus
case
--
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
well,
it
seems
--
yes,
that's
the
one
face
of
it
but
if
this
party
had
other
remedies,
it
seems
to
me
would
be
a
moot
question
and
on
that
basis,
it
ought
to
be
concerned
with
this
court.
and
of
course
we
have
--
now
have
the
federal
law.
well,
anyway,
to
get
back
to
justice
marshall,
why
as
i
say
anyone
starting
from
scratch,
if
i
may
use
that
word,
who
would
want
fair
housing
would
have
to
take
a
tour.
if
they
found
an
unfriendly
council,
they
would
have
to
take
it
to
referendum.
now,
that
is
not
necessary.
under
the
procedure
now,
council
may
had
any
time
to
put
this
fair
housing
ordinance
before
the
people
and
so
therefore
the
barrier
--
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
right.
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
yes.
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
if
i
may
just
a
moment
here.
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
made
this
statement
your
honor
on
that
subject
at
page
50
of
the
record.
it
is
obvious
therefore
that
if
section
137
of
the
akron
charter
is
valid,
its
words
require
the
conclusion
that
the
ordinance
relied
upon
by
realtor
had
ceased
to
be
effective.
immediately,
that
ordinance
was
in
effect
when
the
charter
section
was
adopted
and
the
ordinance
was
never
approved
by
the
electors,
has
never
been
approved
by
the
electors.
so
that
in
the
sense
from
the
time,
for
the
25
days,
--
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
yes,
yes.
well,
of
course
we
contend
that
it's
valid
because
it
sets
up
no
particular
extra,
unusual
burdens.
the
classification
in
order
to
be
obnoxious
i
think
this
court
has
generally
said
must
be
arbitrary
and
having
no
reasonable
basis.
well,
certainly
if
the
people
want
to
refer
--
have
referred
to
the
question
of
fair
housing
would
not
seem
to
be
unreasonable
in
view
of
the
environment
that
existed
at
the
time.
now
--
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
in
view
of
the
environment
that
existed
at
the
time,
namely
that
there
was
pending
going
in
the
state,
the
activity
of
having
a
state
law
that
possibly
that
the
enforcement
provisions
of
a
city
ordinance
may
not
have
been
effective
any
way
in
view
of
those
things,
in
view
of
the
fact
that
it's
not
necessary
to
have
one
that
this
was
the
first
opportunity
in
i
would
say
that
people
could
have
to
decide
whether
they
wanted
one
or
not
since
council
had
elected
to
pass
the
ordinance
the
way
they
did.
so
in
view
of
all
of
those
things,
i
don't
see
that
it's
unreasonable
at
all
that
they
should
desire
to
do
it
this
way.
so
that
really,
all
it
has
to
be
done
now
is
to
have
council
bring
it
to
the
voters,
saving
anyone
who
wanted
to
have
fair
housing,
the
obligation
or
the
need
for
getting
out
a
referendum
petition,
granting
as
justice
says
indicated
it
for
the
25
days,
there
was
a
law
but
nothing
had
ever
happened.
the
commission
had
never
got
organized.
there
was
--
everyone
conceded
i
think
at
the
time
that
they
were
waiting
to
see
what
was
going
on
at
the
state
courts
with
respect
to
overland,
with
respect
to
whether
we're
going
to
have
state
law
or
not.
so
in
view,
i'll
grant
you
that
maybe
one
of
the
things
but
taking
overall,
the
environment
was
favorable
to
those
who
wanted
to
do
it
this
way
in
my
humble
judgment.
oh!
now
as
to
other
barriers
of
course
council
has
spoken
of
the
tax
ordinance
and
that
was
one
of
their
chief
complaints
that
we
had.
these
people
had
heavier
burdens.
well,
this
ordinance
was
singled
out
while
it
wasn't
as
they
have
indicated
here
both
these
tax
procedures
and
then
also
there's
another
one
which
is
not
in
my
brief
and
i
regret
in
preparing
for
this
case
that
i
--
being
my
first
trip
over
the
road,
i
perhaps
may
note
down
what
i
should
have
namely
with
respect
to
where
mrs.
hunter
now
resides
and
with
respect
to
another
charter
in
section
39
regarding
franchisers
says
this
that
if
anyone
wants
a
franchise
for
public
utility,
every
such
proposed
grant
and
every
proposed
renewal
or
extension
of
such
grant
by
ordinance
passed
by
the
council
shall
be
subject
to
referendum.
there,
anyone
who
wants
to
have
some
sort
of
franchise
stands
the
risk
right
off
the
back
of
having
the
people
vote
on
the
subject
if
they
want
to
circulate
petitions
for
that
purpose.
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
well,
some
of
them
are
but
some
of
that
i
dealt
with
a
little
fellow
with
the
bus
line
who
i
had
to
help
get
a
franchise
with
the
city,
was
put
to
bankrupt
when
he
started.
but
i'll
say
even
he
would
be
better
off.
yes,
i'd
agree.
well
--
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
well,
of
course,
granting
this
is
the
element
of
the
racial
discrimination
but
in
the
sense
we
look
at
on
this
instance
was
an
ordinance
dealing
with
a
regulation
of
a
subject
and
of
course
one
of
the
subject
was
the
sale
of
housing
whether
it
was
to
negroes,
to
whatever
classification
of
people
was.
it
covered
namely
the
subject
of
the
sale
and
the
rental
of
property
and
in
that
sense,
i
think
that
the
people
definitely
had
a
right
to
consider
that
like
they
have
done
in
other
situations
in
their
charter
haven't
referred
to
them
for
the
purpose
of
whether
they
wanted
it
or
not.
not
merely
because
they
ought
to
go
slow
in
this
area
but
because
of
the
other
issues
that
i've
mentioned,
namely
that
it
was
still
going
through
the
state
courts.
it
was
still
being
looked
at
into
by
the
state
legislator
and
also
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
really
if
we're
going
to
regulate
this
thing
and
do
this
properly
right
possibly
that
it
plays
out
to
be
done
with
the
state
because
really
in
the
area
that
we're
dealing
with
here,
it's
subject
involving
real
estate
people,
the
way
they
handle
this
business
and
as
i
pointed
out,
that's
the
basic
subject.
the
few
transactions
between
private
people
is
a
nullity
anymore.
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
no,
i
--
my
statement
was
that
not
necessarily.
i
didn't
say
that.
i
know
that
the
court
said
but
that
isn't
--
i
wouldn't
necessarily
make
that
--
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
no,
i
didn't
speak
loud
enough.
i
said
regardless
of
that.
i
made
that
an
exception
to
my
statement
and
i
said
my
earlier
--
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
my
position
is
that
the
need
to
go
slow
isn't
an
element
in
here
as
to
why
the
people
would
want
to
have
this.
i
don't
consider
that
really
vital
to
the
thing.
i
--
i
think
that
the
basic
other
interest,
what
i've
talked
about
here.
well,
here
we
are.
here's
a
big
subject
we're
going
to
get
into
and
by
the
way
of
course
i
can't
go
off
the
record
but
i
understood
that
the
real
estate
people
were
really
the
ones
who
were
in
favor
of
having
the
act
down
the
state
in
having
it
where
it
could
be
regulated.
and
since
we're
getting
into
a
vast
subject
of
dealings
with
transactions
involving
the
financing
and
sale,
in
the
mortgaging
interest
and
all
of
those
things
on
property,
well,
i
will
conclude
by
saying
that
it
seems
to
--
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
yes,
sir.
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
amendment,
yes.
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
yes.
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
but
didn't
it
just
gotten
repeal
among
other
things
just
suspend
an
existing
ordinance.
yes,
it
did
that
and
--
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
yes,
but
i
think
a
city
can
repeal
an
ordinance
because
there
are
the
procedures
and
the
machinery
was
adopted
for
their
purpose.
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
well,
there
are
several
arguments
that
i'll
think
about
tonight
perhaps
that
i
ought
to
say.
but
i'm
going
to
close
with
this
that
not
only
several
of
your
fistful.
that
iceberg
under
what
i
presented
here
is
pretty
large
and
it
was
a
good
argument
but
i
didn't
make
it.
it
seems
to
me
that
we
don't
need
a
hatchet
operation
here,
that
after
all,
we
do
have
decent,
we
have
surgical
machinery
that
is
taking
care
of
this
problem
by
virtue
of
the
state
and
the
federal
law
and
the
1869
act
and
that
therefore
we
ought
to
do
something
now
which
would
amputate
the
whole
governmental
machinery,
the
process
of
initiative
referendum
which
is
really
structured
for
the
local
communities
and
that's
another
argument
i
should
have
made.
this
is
after
all,
this
is
only
local.
maybe
i
did
touch
on
that.
this
isn't
statewide.
this
doesn't
cover
everybody.
this
is
just
akron
and
so
my
final
word
is
that
we
shouldn't
burn
down
the
barn
to
roast
the
pig.
i
think
with
that
i
shall
close.
thank
you
gentlemen.
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court,
counsel.
our
position
here
has
three
phases.
i'm
briefly
going
to
touch
on
the
subject
of
mootness,
then
i'm
going
to
talk
about
where
we
stand
with
respect
to
reitman
and
then
i
intend
to
talk
some
about
the
classification.
now,
with
respect
to
mootness,
it
seems
to
me
to
start
with
and
unless
my
friends
on
the
other
side
here
feel
that
the
people
of
akron
will
refuse
to
obey
the
state
or
the
federal
law
that
if
that's
their
argument
then
perhaps
we
shouldn't
be
here
at
all
but
i
don't
think
akron
are
that
kind
of
people.
they
obey
the
state
and
federal
law.
now,
as
to
this
particular
specific
complaint,
both
of
the
state
and
the
federal
law
do
cover
it
because
if
you
will
observe
my
appendix
b
in
my
brief,
this
is
a
complaint
relating
to
the
activities
of
a
real
estate
agent
and
that
is
covered,
that
proposition
is
covered
by
both
of
the
laws.
that
was
really
the
basic
purpose
in
the
sense
as
i
see
it
for
the
state
and
federal
law.
and
along
that
line,
i
begin
to
thinking
a
little
bit
about
it
and
i
look
in
the
sunday
classification
ads,
just
the
sunday
before
i
came
down
here
as
to
advertisements
with
respect
to
the
sale
and
rental
of
real
estate
and
i
was
amazed
to
find
that
of
some
close
to
500
listings,
448
of
them
were
listings
by
real
estate
people
and
only
15
or
20
were
listings
by
individuals.
in
my
own
observation
is
that
my
travels
through
the
city
of
akron,
i
have
yet
to
see
a
sign
where
like
it
used
to
be
alvin
vinopal
wants
to
sell
his
house.
it's
--
this
is
relates
the
regulation
of
a
business,
a
vast
business,
namely
the
real
estate
business
as
well
as
the
banking
business
in
certain
areas
as
i
will
come
to.
now,
the
other
aspect
of
the
question
of
the
mootness
here
is
that
nellie
hunter
anyway
would
hardly
be
involved
in
this
complaint
to
find
a
house
because
she's
now
living
in
chicago.
and
the
other
aspect
about
the
fact
that
we
have
the
state
and
the
federal
law
as
well
as
the
jones
doctrine
under
the
state
and
federal
act,
the
ultimate
complaint
of
a
commission
whatever
may
be
ultimately
ends
up
in
the
common
pleas
court
of
the
county
where
the
individuals
are
located
if
they
have
the
state
law
while
the
state
can
take
over
if
they
do
or
the
city
can
take
over.
and
so
you
get
right
--
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
well,
i'll
grant
you.
it
doesn't
show
there,
i'm
referring
to
a
newspaper
article
about
the
subject
in
discussing
that
counsel.
it
isn't
in
the
record.
i
would
say
that
but
a
reason
this
newspaper
article,
this
subject
has
been
covered
quite
--
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
sorry,
i
didn't
mean
to
--
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
thank
you.
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
no
intention
to
offend
the
court
or
counsel.
i
noticed
that
it
is
seems
the
--
in
these
cases
of
this
area
that
the
courts
have
very
little
record
come
up
here
and
there
is
a
lot
of
assumptions
are
made
about
what
was
before
the
court.
a
--
another
aspect
of
mootness
is
two
that
akron
is
surrounded
by
what
we
would
five
or
six
bedroom
communities
which
really
have
no
law
on
the
subject
and
these
real
estate
people
i
suppose
is,
this
court
certainly
i
would
assume
and
i
hope
the
court
would
assume
that
these
real
estate
dealers
involved
in
a
vast
metropolitan
area
like
that
have
office
and
in
fact
they
do
in
just
those
separate
communities
and
their
activities
relate
to
properties
only
in
those
communities
and
the
akron
law
wouldn't
cover
that
subject
at
all.
now,
as
a
side
issue
to
why
i
think
that
really
the
place
for
this
type
of
law
is
with
the
state
is
again
really
real
estate
business,
the
activity
of
dealing
and
if
you
will
observe
the
ordinance
and
even
the
state
act,
the
ordinance,
any
person
to
whom
an
application
is
made
for
a
financial
assistance
for
the
acquisition,
construction,
rehabilitation,
repair,
or
maintenance
of
any
housing.
now,
that
certainly
is
a
subject
which
is
a
regulatory
matter
involving
real
estate
people
and
banking
people
and
where
real
estate
people
and
banking
people
are
regulated
by
state
law,
i
think
that
the
state
law
is
the
place
for
this
particular
type
of
regulatory
law.
and
that
the
state
law
does
cover
the
activities
of
real
estate
agents.
and
in
fact,
the
matter
i'm
coming
to
now
deal
specifically
with
that.
i
want
to
talk
about
the
reitman
theory
and
the
background
in
this
particular
case.
now,
again
justice
fortas
so
that
i
want
to
be
fair
here
in
the
record
talking
about
background,
i'm
referring
to
a
document
which
my
adversaries
have
quoted
on
both
of
their
briefs,
discrimination
on
housing
in
ohio
and
i'm
sure
the
courts
of
the
state
of
ohio
must
have
had
this
before
them
although
there's
nothing
in
any
of
the
opinions
relating
to
it
but
discrimination
in
ohio
subject
got
statewide
by
virtue
of
this
report
of
the
civil
rights
commission.
now,
that
was
in
january
of
1963
and
then
a
bill
was
introduced
by
the
month
after
that
in
1963
and
that
bill
died
as
the
same
goes
in
june
of
1963
it
was
indefinitely
postponed.
but
all
along
i
feel
to
the
--
and
the
environment
was
that
the
state
was
talking
about
fair
housing
discrimination
in
ohio,
so
the
next
thing
that
happened
we
come
along
then
to
july
of
1964
in
akron
then
passes
the
fair
housing
ordinance.
but
prior
to
that,
there
was
in
the
courts
of
the
state
of
ohio
commencing
in
1963
the
case
of
porter
versus
oberlin
which
is
cited
in
one
of
the
briefs
here
wherein
the
city
of
oberlin
had
a
fair
housing
ordinance
and
it
was
attacked
as
being
unconstitutional
and
in
fact,
the
state
court
of
ohio
did
declare
that
particular
ordinance
to
be
unconstitutional,
the
enforcement
portion
of
it
stating
that
here
was
the
attempt
of
a
municipality
to
set
up
in
the
sense
of
court
and
that
courts
only
could
be
created,
particular
municipal
courts
could
only
be
created
by
the
general
legislator
of
the
state
of
ohio
and
that
therefore
since
this
commission
was
doing
something
in
the
nature
of
a
judicial
function
that
was
unconstitutional.
however,
i
do
want
to
say
though
in
fairness
that
when
the
matter
came
up
in
our
case,
the
akron
case,
the
status
of
it
was
it
was
raised
again
and
in
the
akron
case,
the
judge
who
wrote
the
opinion
when
our
case
was
before
them
on
the
demur
level
said
that
the
akron
officials
had
no
standing
to
appeal
that
case
and
then
several
of
the
judges
said
that,
well,
in
view
of
the
fact
that
this
court
and
as
was
formally
constituted
held
that
the
enforcement
section
of
that
fair
housing
ordinance
was
unconstitutional
we
would
have
to
go
along
with
it.
but
now
the
consistency
of
the
court
had
changed
and
we
probably
wouldn't
do
it.
but
the
judgment
in
that
court
only
stood
for
the
fact
that
the
city
of
akron's
officials
could
not
challenge
the
constitutional
question.
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
that
wasn't
decided
your
honor
until
march
of
1965
so
we
passed
137
in
august
of
1964
right
within
25
days
after
the
fair
housing
ordinance
went
on.
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
well,
my
own
judgment
as
to
why
i
think
it
was
passed
is
first
of
all,
we
start
with
a
proposition
that
we
don't
have
to
have
fair
housing
ordinance
in
akron,
that's
number
one.
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
if
fair
housing
ordinance
was
passed
as
an
emergency
ordinance
so
that
would
remove
--
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
no,
it
have
to
be
attacked
by
initiative.
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
well,
--
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
yes.
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
which
we
did.
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
well,
in
a
sense
i
think
we've
been
afforded
the
proponents
of
fair
housing
when
i
come
to
that,
i'll
tell
you
why.
now,
the
initiative
of
course
would
be
to
start
a
new
law
or
to
repeal.
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
well,
because
i
--
well,
benefited
her
in
the
political
process
that
were
involved
in
this
particular
activity,
that's
what
i
mean
and
i
will
come
to
that.
well
--
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
yes.
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
that's
in
the
record,
your
honor.
yes.
it's
in
the
--
not
in
the
printed
record
but
it's
in
the
original
record.
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
well,
it's
in
there
and
by
the
way,
there
are
certain,
one
or
two
sections
of
the
charter
which
i
intend
to
refer
to
which
are
not
in
the
printed
record
but
they
are
in
the
original
record
copies
of
which
were
furnished
to
state
court
by
our
office,
i
know.
well,
of
course,
then
we
come
along
as
i
say
to
64
when
the
fair
housing
ordinance
was
passed
and
the
charter
amendment.
immediately
right
thereafter,
and
of
course
initiative
at
that
time
would
have
required
naturally
10%
of
the
voters
to
initiate
a
repeal
of
fair
housing
which
you
would
call
it
but
they
chose
the
other.
then
now
--
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
no,
you
see
we
have
a
procedure
where
the
council
themselves
put
it
on
the
ballot.
it
wasn't
required
to
go
to
the
--
to
put
this
charter
amendment
on
the
ballot
at
all.
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
yes.
by
section
36,
council
is
permitted
--
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
--
to
put
all
ordinances
that
they
--
any
charter
amendments
which
they
desire
on
the
ballot
themselves.
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
yes.
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
yes.
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
oh,
i'm
sorry.
maybe
i
am
confused
about
that.
i
meant
--
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
yes,
i'm
sorry.
no.
there
was
this
petition
to
amend
the
charter
as
an
initiative
petition.
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
yes.
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
7%.
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
yes.
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
the
county
voters
are
200,000.
i
think
the
city
voters
are
somewhere
on
150
to
170,000.
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
yes,
300,000
or
somewhere
at
350.
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
i
think
we
have
11%.
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
well,
then
we
come
along
to
january
of
1965
at
which
time
nellie
hunter
filed
this
complaint
and
following
that,
there
had
been
again
activity
instituted
in
the
state
legislator
whereby
in
march
of
1965,
the
state
fair
housing
bill
was
enacted
and
i
think
just
as
a
casual
personal
observation
as
to
why
it
didn't
get
enacted
in
1963
is
because
someone
who
has
hazily
done
after
this
report
and
someone
wanted
to
put
it
in
with
health
welfare
and
morals
in
that
part
of
the
code
and
it
was
batched
up
and
so
it
come
back
the
next
time
that
the
legislator
met
and
they
passed
it
quite
readily
under
the
civil
rights
commission
section.
so,
as
i
say
as
to
what
the
environment
in
the
background
then
of
fair
housing
was
really
around
the
time
when
this
took
place
was
namely
that
it
was
already
started
in
the
state
and
that
i
would
presume
someone
would
feel,
must
have
felt
that
after
all
perhaps
the
place
like
i've
just
said
here,
the
place
to
regulate
this
thing
would
be
statewide
and
that
first
and
above
all,
we
don't
have
to
have
one
in
akron
anyway.
there
are
some,
there
ought
to
be
some
place
when
you
could
maintain
that
particular
position,
it
would
seem
to
me.
now,
as
to
what
the
impact
of
this
particular
amendment
had
for
instance
on
mrs.
hunter,
it
seems
to
me
although
i
don't
want
to
be
unfair
in
mentioning
where
she
now
resides
but
as
to
her
it
would
be
none.
now,
as
to
others
generally,
the
only
time
that
there
would've
been
any
possibility
that
their
rights
were
infringed
would
be
from
the
period
of
july
of
1964
until
october
of
1965
when
we
had
the
state
law
because
we
then
have
the
state
law
covering
pretty
much
a
subject.
although,
i
--
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
your
honor,
i
--
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
on
page
13
of
my
brief,
i
have
it
set
out.
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
yes.
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
now,
i
do
want
to
say
that
the
state
law
doesn't
cover
the
sale
and
rental
of
private
property
between
and
a
and
b.
i
will
--
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
yes,
in
my
opinion,
it
certainly
does.
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
that
would
be
section
--
under
4112.02.
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
page
11
of
my
brief.
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
yes.
there
is
the
section
6,
print,
publish,
circulate
any
statement
or
advertising
relating
to
the
sale,
transfer,
so
on,
so
forth
of
personal
residence.
the
whole
tenor
of
the
--
that
portion
of
the
act
seems
to
me
relates
to
the
regulation
of
the
activities
of
real
estate
people
those
dealing
in
this
business.
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
well,
from
the
complaint
that
i
gather,
there
was
a
circulated
and
implied
that
there
were
certain
properties
for
sale
and
then
when
it
come
time
to
show
with
this
lady,
they
were
--
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
i
--
i'm
not
doubtful
about
it.
i
think
if
it
was
a
complaint
about
that
alvin
vinopal
refused
to
sell
somebody
their
house,
i
think
that
would
be
very
serious
it
wouldn't
apply
but
i
don't
think
under
this
--
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
i
think
it
does,
her
complaint.
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
no.
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
no,
i
do
not.
i
think
these
particular
paragraphs
were
sufficient
to
cover
that
particular
complaint.
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
no,
of
course,
the
state
court
of
course
all
we
dealt
with
there
is
whether
or
not
the
state
court
had
a
right
that
this
a
regulation
and
that
the
state
court
had
--
that
the
people
of
akron
had
the
right
to
vote.
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
yes.
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
well,
in
this
case,
the
question
of
that
problem
never
was
raised
in
the
state
court.
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
no,
i
don't
think.
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
yes.
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
yes.
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
that's
right.
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
say
what?
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
well,
on
the
basis
of
the
fact
that
we
did
not
have
to
have
a
fair
housing
ordinance
in
akron
that
we
have
adequate
remedies
namely
by
the
state
law
and
now
the
federal
law.
at
the
time
of
course
that
she
filed
a
complaint,
there
was
no
federal
law
of
course.
however,
there
was
the
federal
law
with
respect
to
the
private
individual's
sale
of
the
property
and
there
were
those
remedies.
what
i'm
coming
to
about
that
we
helped
or
that
the
situation
was
a
benefit
in
this
respect
as
to
the
matter
of
the
burdens
that
are
placed
upon
people
in
this
particular
situation.
now,
i
read
a
vast
--
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
alright.
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
yes.
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
yes,
sir.
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
yes,
sir.
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
that's
right
but
that
isn't
the
case
we
have
here.
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
yes.
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
well,
merely
on
the
basis
of
a
statement
of
some
real
estate
agent,
it
would
be
arguable,
yes.
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
but
not
in
her
specific
private
dealing
with
any
private
individual,
it
wouldn't
be.
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
i
got
into
the
question
here
of
what
barriers
are
placed
in
the
path
of
these
people
who
wanted
this
particular
ordinance
and
i
have
read
a
stack
of
cases
i
guess
this
high
and
right
now,
i
would
say
they're
all
piled
on
the
floor
of
my
mind
and
i
couldn't
sort
anything
up
and
tell
which
or
any
of
them
ought
to
be
catalogued
but
i
drafted
a
little
statement
here
which
i
thought
was
in
the
sense
the
rule
would
apply
here
as
to
whether
or
not
there
had
been
unreasonable
barriers
placed
in
the
way
for
these
people
to
accomplish
what
they
want
and
i
think
we
go
back
basically
to
the
proposition
that
this
really
is
a
political
duel
or
a
political
competition.
someone
wanted
fair
housing
and
someone
didn't
want
fair
housing.
now,
as
i
see
it,
in
a
political
duel
between
those
who
want
a
certain
regulation
and
between
those
who
oppose
it
if
the
state
or
the
city
in
this
particular
case
--
the
city
or
the
state
in
this
particular
case
may
not
place
in
the
way
of
those
who
desire
it
any
barriers
which
without
the
state
or
here
the
city's
total
political
system
taken
as
a
whole
any
barriers
which
are
especially
difficult
of
surmounting
by
comparison
with
those
barriers
that
normally
stand
in
the
way
are
those
who
wish
to
use
the
political
process
to
get
what
they
want.
now,
in
coming
to
the
answer
to
--
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
well,
i
would
say
that
i'd
have
to
grant
that
certainly
those
people
have
the
right
to
their
constitutional
rights
and
it
would
have
to
fit
in
whatever
process
the
city
or
the
state
involved,
included,
would
have
to
be
rights
that
are
allowed
and
permitted
under
the
federal
constitution.
of
course,
that
would
be
basic
in
this
assumption
here.
now,
so
i
say
that
the
fact
about
the
way
this
particular
charter
amendment
ended
up
was
that
it's
easier
for
those
who
desire
to
get
fair
housing
with
it
than
it
was
before
because
i'm
sure
this
court
can
conceive
and
i
certainly
do
of
city
council's
right
in
our
own,
my
own
area
who
wouldn't
pass
fair
housing.
so,
therefore
what
are
they
going
to
have
to
do
with
those
who
want
it?
they're
going
to
have
it
get
referred.
those
who
would
want
to
have
it
eliminated;
they
will
have
to
use
the
process
of
referendum.
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
yes.
no,
we
do
not
have
it.
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
well,
no
because
in
the
state
court
of
ohio
says
that
we
did
not
because
it
was
suspended.
there
was
no
fair
housing
law
--
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
well,
until
that
the
ordinance
become
effective,
your
honor,
it
seems
to
me
we
wouldn't
have
it.
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
well,
again
getting
back
to
the
total
procedures
which
are
permissible
--
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
well,
--
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
well,
because
i
think
the
state
commission
was
far
better
equipped
to
handle
the
complaint,
that's
another
thing.
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
yes,
it's
in
operation
now
and
real
estate
people
are
regulated
by
the
state.
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
oh,
yes.
it's
going
to
be
my
judgment
that
it
would.
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
well,
there
are
those
who
feel
we
have
too
many
laws
overlapping
as
they
are
and
my
own
judgment
is
that
since
this
is
a
total
problem
that
we
ought
to
regulate
statewide
that
ought
to
be
done
that
way
because
as
i
just
said
there
are
many
of
this
municipalities
in
akron
who
aren't
going
to
have,
do
not
have
one
and
never
will
have
one
in
my
own
humble
judgment
and
so
--
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
well,
preempt
--
the
state
is
now
in
and
i'm
sure
that
if
akron
tried
to
do
anything
that
the
state
found
offensive
to
the
way
it
was
handling
then
that
would
be
held
improper.
i
think
the
cities
could
have
--
the
cities
are
allowed
to
have
laws
which
are
not
in
conflict
with
the
general
laws
so
if
we
had
some
--
if
it
didn't
disturb
what
the
states
got
it
wouldn't
--
there
would
be
no
problem.
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
yes.
of
course,
my
position
that
since
--
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
that
--
that's
my
position
that
there
was
a
state
law
which
provides
the
relief
that
she
could
had.
by
the
way,
this
was
a
mandamus
case
--
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
well,
it
seems
--
yes,
that's
the
one
face
of
it
but
if
this
party
had
other
remedies,
it
seems
to
me
would
be
a
moot
question
and
on
that
basis,
it
ought
to
be
concerned
with
this
court.
and
of
course
we
have
--
now
have
the
federal
law.
well,
anyway,
to
get
back
to
justice
marshall,
why
as
i
say
anyone
starting
from
scratch,
if
i
may
use
that
word,
who
would
want
fair
housing
would
have
to
take
a
tour.
if
they
found
an
unfriendly
council,
they
would
have
to
take
it
to
referendum.
now,
that
is
not
necessary.
under
the
procedure
now,
council
may
had
any
time
to
put
this
fair
housing
ordinance
before
the
people
and
so
therefore
the
barrier
--
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
right.
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
yes.
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
if
i
may
just
a
moment
here.
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
made
this
statement
your
honor
on
that
subject
at
page
50
of
the
record.
it
is
obvious
therefore
that
if
section
137
of
the
akron
charter
is
valid,
its
words
require
the
conclusion
that
the
ordinance
relied
upon
by
realtor
had
ceased
to
be
effective.
immediately,
that
ordinance
was
in
effect
when
the
charter
section
was
adopted
and
the
ordinance
was
never
approved
by
the
electors,
has
never
been
approved
by
the
electors.
so
that
in
the
sense
from
the
time,
for
the
25
days,
--
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
yes,
yes.
well,
of
course
we
contend
that
it's
valid
because
it
sets
up
no
particular
extra,
unusual
burdens.
the
classification
in
order
to
be
obnoxious
i
think
this
court
has
generally
said
must
be
arbitrary
and
having
no
reasonable
basis.
well,
certainly
if
the
people
want
to
refer
--
have
referred
to
the
question
of
fair
housing
would
not
seem
to
be
unreasonable
in
view
of
the
environment
that
existed
at
the
time.
now
--
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
in
view
of
the
environment
that
existed
at
the
time,
namely
that
there
was
pending
going
in
the
state,
the
activity
of
having
a
state
law
that
possibly
that
the
enforcement
provisions
of
a
city
ordinance
may
not
have
been
effective
any
way
in
view
of
those
things,
in
view
of
the
fact
that
it's
not
necessary
to
have
one
that
this
was
the
first
opportunity
in
i
would
say
that
people
could
have
to
decide
whether
they
wanted
one
or
not
since
council
had
elected
to
pass
the
ordinance
the
way
they
did.
so
in
view
of
all
of
those
things,
i
don't
see
that
it's
unreasonable
at
all
that
they
should
desire
to
do
it
this
way.
so
that
really,
all
it
has
to
be
done
now
is
to
have
council
bring
it
to
the
voters,
saving
anyone
who
wanted
to
have
fair
housing,
the
obligation
or
the
need
for
getting
out
a
referendum
petition,
granting
as
justice
says
indicated
it
for
the
25
days,
there
was
a
law
but
nothing
had
ever
happened.
the
commission
had
never
got
organized.
there
was
--
everyone
conceded
i
think
at
the
time
that
they
were
waiting
to
see
what
was
going
on
at
the
state
courts
with
respect
to
overland,
with
respect
to
whether
we're
going
to
have
state
law
or
not.
so
in
view,
i'll
grant
you
that
maybe
one
of
the
things
but
taking
overall,
the
environment
was
favorable
to
those
who
wanted
to
do
it
this
way
in
my
humble
judgment.
oh!
now
as
to
other
barriers
of
course
council
has
spoken
of
the
tax
ordinance
and
that
was
one
of
their
chief
complaints
that
we
had.
these
people
had
heavier
burdens.
well,
this
ordinance
was
singled
out
while
it
wasn't
as
they
have
indicated
here
both
these
tax
procedures
and
then
also
there's
another
one
which
is
not
in
my
brief
and
i
regret
in
preparing
for
this
case
that
i
--
being
my
first
trip
over
the
road,
i
perhaps
may
note
down
what
i
should
have
namely
with
respect
to
where
mrs.
hunter
now
resides
and
with
respect
to
another
charter
in
section
39
regarding
franchisers
says
this
that
if
anyone
wants
a
franchise
for
public
utility,
every
such
proposed
grant
and
every
proposed
renewal
or
extension
of
such
grant
by
ordinance
passed
by
the
council
shall
be
subject
to
referendum.
there,
anyone
who
wants
to
have
some
sort
of
franchise
stands
the
risk
right
off
the
back
of
having
the
people
vote
on
the
subject
if
they
want
to
circulate
petitions
for
that
purpose.
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
well,
some
of
them
are
but
some
of
that
i
dealt
with
a
little
fellow
with
the
bus
line
who
i
had
to
help
get
a
franchise
with
the
city,
was
put
to
bankrupt
when
he
started.
but
i'll
say
even
he
would
be
better
off.
yes,
i'd
agree.
well
--
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
well,
of
course,
granting
this
is
the
element
of
the
racial
discrimination
but
in
the
sense
we
look
at
on
this
instance
was
an
ordinance
dealing
with
a
regulation
of
a
subject
and
of
course
one
of
the
subject
was
the
sale
of
housing
whether
it
was
to
negroes,
to
whatever
classification
of
people
was.
it
covered
namely
the
subject
of
the
sale
and
the
rental
of
property
and
in
that
sense,
i
think
that
the
people
definitely
had
a
right
to
consider
that
like
they
have
done
in
other
situations
in
their
charter
haven't
referred
to
them
for
the
purpose
of
whether
they
wanted
it
or
not.
not
merely
because
they
ought
to
go
slow
in
this
area
but
because
of
the
other
issues
that
i've
mentioned,
namely
that
it
was
still
going
through
the
state
courts.
it
was
still
being
looked
at
into
by
the
state
legislator
and
also
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
really
if
we're
going
to
regulate
this
thing
and
do
this
properly
right
possibly
that
it
plays
out
to
be
done
with
the
state
because
really
in
the
area
that
we're
dealing
with
here,
it's
subject
involving
real
estate
people,
the
way
they
handle
this
business
and
as
i
pointed
out,
that's
the
basic
subject.
the
few
transactions
between
private
people
is
a
nullity
anymore.
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
no,
i
--
my
statement
was
that
not
necessarily.
i
didn't
say
that.
i
know
that
the
court
said
but
that
isn't
--
i
wouldn't
necessarily
make
that
--
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
no,
i
didn't
speak
loud
enough.
i
said
regardless
of
that.
i
made
that
an
exception
to
my
statement
and
i
said
my
earlier
--
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
my
position
is
that
the
need
to
go
slow
isn't
an
element
in
here
as
to
why
the
people
would
want
to
have
this.
i
don't
consider
that
really
vital
to
the
thing.
i
--
i
think
that
the
basic
other
interest,
what
i've
talked
about
here.
well,
here
we
are.
here's
a
big
subject
we're
going
to
get
into
and
by
the
way
of
course
i
can't
go
off
the
record
but
i
understood
that
the
real
estate
people
were
really
the
ones
who
were
in
favor
of
having
the
act
down
the
state
in
having
it
where
it
could
be
regulated.
and
since
we're
getting
into
a
vast
subject
of
dealings
with
transactions
involving
the
financing
and
sale,
in
the
mortgaging
interest
and
all
of
those
things
on
property,
well,
i
will
conclude
by
saying
that
it
seems
to
--
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
yes,
sir.
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
amendment,
yes.
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
yes.
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
but
didn't
it
just
gotten
repeal
among
other
things
just
suspend
an
existing
ordinance.
yes,
it
did
that
and
--
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
yes,
but
i
think
a
city
can
repeal
an
ordinance
because
there
are
the
procedures
and
the
machinery
was
adopted
for
their
purpose.
mr.
alvin
c.
vinopal
well,
there
are
several
arguments
that
i'll
think
about
tonight
perhaps
that
i
ought
to
say.
but
i'm
going
to
close
with
this
that
not
only
several
of
your
fistful.
that
iceberg
under
what
i
presented
here
is
pretty
large
and
it
was
a
good
argument
but
i
didn't
make
it.
it
seems
to
me
that
we
don't
need
a
hatchet
operation
here,
that
after
all,
we
do
have
decent,
we
have
surgical
machinery
that
is
taking
care
of
this
problem
by
virtue
of
the
state
and
the
federal
law
and
the
1869
act
and
that
therefore
we
ought
to
do
something
now
which
would
amputate
the
whole
governmental
machinery,
the
process
of
initiative
referendum
which
is
really
structured
for
the
local
communities
and
that's
another
argument
i
should
have
made.
this
is
after
all,
this
is
only
local.
maybe
i
did
touch
on
that.
this
isn't
statewide.
this
doesn't
cover
everybody.
this
is
just
akron
and
so
my
final
word
is
that
we
shouldn't
burn
down
the
barn
to
roast
the
pig.
i
think
with
that
i
shall
close.
thank
you
gentlemen.
