justice

white
mr.
carter
the
law
was
suspended
by
the
charter
provision,
i
gather.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
how
would
it
have
been
--
would
it
have
--
could
it
have
been
approved
with
the
city
council.
would
the
city
council
have
to
pass
it
again?
it
was
submitted
or
could
it
have
been
done
by
initiative?
justice
byron
r.
white
there
was
no
--
in
the
charter
amendment,
there
was
no
automatic
provision
for
getting
it
on
the
ballot?
justice
byron
r.
white
has
it
ever
been
put
on
the
ballot?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
was
it
put
on?
justice
byron
r.
white
by
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
did
it
pass?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
what
was
the
vote
on?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
it
to
be
identical
or
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well
would
the
appellant
have
ever
remedy
either
one
of
the
1966
statute
or
1968?
justice
byron
r.
white
notwithstanding
the
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean,
you
wouldn't
have
the
1968
statute
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
would
have
under
1982.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
the
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
the
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
only
if
it's
put
to
referendum
by
initiative.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
just
--
are
you
just
saying
that
the
legislation
is
bad
on
its
face
because
it
has
a
racial
classification?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
in
the
end
of
your
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
when
would
a
racial
classification
ever
be
permissible?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
a
racial
classification
is
justifiable?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what's
your
position
on
it
because
if
you
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
your
position
on
it?
i
would
suppose
your
argument
would
be
one
way
if
any
racial
classification
is
bad
per
se,
you
could
just
stop
there.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
do
you
think
it
is
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
redundant?
is
that
a
redundant
statement?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
do
have
to
go
beyond
the
face
of
the
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
would
you
say
the
desire
to
aid
or
to
further
the
interest
of
a
specific
class
of
people
would
be
necessary
or
compelling
enough
for
racial
classification?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it
all
has
to
be
a
legitimate
objective
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
to
justify
state
interest.
it
doesn't
have
to
be
compelling.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
is
it
necessary
to
aid
a
specific
group
of
people?
i
mean
it's
compelling
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
perhaps
you
want
to
argue
another
case.
we'll
give
you
some
time.
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
talking
about
holland
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
think
--
and
you
suggest
that
it
is
not
a
sufficient
reason
to
want
the
voice
of
the
majority
of
the
people
on
a
something
that
they
think
is
important
to
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
this
is
just
something
a
majority
can't
do.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
mr.
vinopal,
could
i
ask
you
a
question
please?
justice
byron
r.
white
didn't
this
ordinance
do
two
things?
it
said
that
a
certain
kind
of
ordinance
can't
be
effective
without
the
vote
of
the
people.
that's
one
thing
it
is.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
but
then
it
also
said
that
an
ordinance
--
a
particular
ordinance
that's
on
the
books
is
suspended.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
why
can't
the
--
why
can't
a
--
don't
you
think
there's
separate
question
involved
here
of
whether
a
city
may
just
drop
and
repeal
an
ordinance
because
this
charter
did
at
least
did
that
may
have
gone
farther
and
did
something
that's
arguably
impermissible?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
don't
we
have
to
hold
that
therefore
that
if
the
city
may
not
--
for
you
to
lose;
don't
we
have
to
hold
that
a
city
may
not
repeal
an
ordinance?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
you're
suggesting
as
an
argument
you
might
make?
justice
byron
r.
white
although
as
i
understood
your
argument,
you've
been
arguing
about
what's
to
the
first
sentence
that
you
may
not
single
out
a
housing
discrimination
ordinance
as
the
kind
must
be
submitted
to
the
electorate
and
another.
that's
been
the
import
of
your
argument,
i
thought.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
did
that
in
arguing
--
up
to
now,
you've
just
been
arguing
about
the
latter
aspect
of
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
mean
we
don't
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
agree
with
you
and
that's
why
i
say
that's
what
have
been
the
burden
of
your
argument
is
the
singling
out
of
this
kind
of
an
ordinance
for
special
treatment.
but
you
still
have
to
get
by
the
--
you
still
have
to
say
that
in
the
process
of
putting
on
this
kind
of
a,
what
you
an
arguably
unconstitutional
provision,
that
the
state
may
not
repeal
an
existing
ordinance.
do
we
have
to
decide
the
whole
for
you
that
a
state
may
not
repeal
an
existing
ordinance?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean
an
existing
fair
housing
ordinance?
do
we
have
to
decide
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
that's
one
thing
the
state
did
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
why
do
we
even
have
to
get
to
it
the
more?
justice
byron
r.
white
let
me
ask
you
this
mr.
carter.
suppose
the
court
decided
that
the
first
sentence
of
this
ordinance
was
unconstitutional
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
and
stopped
it
or
it
said
the
first
sentence
is
unconstitutional
but
it
was
perfectly
constitutional
for
the
state
to
repeal
this
ordinance
so
there
is
no
ordinance
in
effect
in
akron
but
the
provision
singling
out
fair
housing
ordinances
as
those
which
must
go
to
a
referendum
or
an
initiative
is
unconstitutional,
would
that
satisfy
you
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
short
what
is
this
case
about,
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
assume
the
court
agreed
with
you
on
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
want
us
to
say
that
the
repeal
is
also
unconstitutional?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
we
can
say
the
burdens
are
unconstitutional
but
why
does
that
make
the
repeal
unconstitutional?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
you
want
us
to
reach
whether
or
not
the
ordinance
is
now
in
existence
in
akron.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
carter
the
law
was
suspended
by
the
charter

i
gather.
justice

and
then
how
would
it
have
been

would
it
have

could

would

did
it
pass?
