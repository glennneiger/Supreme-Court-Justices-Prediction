when

october

effective
october
30,
1965,
there
was
a
state
law
enacted
that
was
some
time
after
the
institution
of
this
litigation.
now,
would
you
mind
telling
us
your
view
as
to
the
bearing
of
the
state
law
on
this
case?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
carter.
justice
abe
fortas
excuse
me,
mr.
carter,
but
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
your
adversary
on
page
2
of
his
brief
says
that
the
ohio
code
was
amended
to
make
unlawful
certain
discriminatory
practices
in
both
commercial
and
residential
property
and
to
provide
the
ohio
civil
rights
commission
with
the
enforcement
powers.
now,
my
specific
question
to
you
has
to
be
this.
does
this
law,
the
state
law
enacted
after
the
commencement
of
the
litigation
provide
a
remedy
for
the
specific
complaint
of
your
client?
justice
abe
fortas
you'd
like
to
have
five
anyway
wouldn't
you?
justice
abe
fortas
you'd
like
to
have
five
anyway.
justice
abe
fortas
you'd
like
to
have
five
members
of
this
court
anyway.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i'm
having
a
little
difficulty
up
here
mr.
claiborne.
i
take
it,
you
would
not
challenged
the,
or
were
you,
the
constitutionality
of
a
referendum
on
which
the
focus
on
that
would
repeal
the
very
specific
ordinance
de
novo,
would
you
say
that
that
presents
a
--
it
states
a
question
under
the
fourteenth
amendment?
justice
abe
fortas
what
you
mean
is?
justice
abe
fortas
i
thought,
as
i
understand
mr.
carter,
he
was
presenting
this
on
a
very
different
basis.
perhaps
i
misunderstand
but
i
thought
he
was
presenting
this
on
a
following
basis
that
here
is
in
substance
an
overriding
law
which
says
that
you
can
pass
any
kind
to
the
city
council.
in
akron,
you
can
pass
any
kind
of
housing
legislation
you
want
to
by
your
ordinary
processes
but
if
it
is
housing
legislation
that
relates
to
the
problem
of
racial
discrimination,
you
may
not,
you
must
first
submit
that
to
the
voters.
it's
my
understanding
of
this
argument
that
he
says
that
that
is
a
discrimination
on
racial
grounds
without
a
permissible
object
and
that
it
therefore
violates
the
fourteenth
amendment
perhaps
specifically
the
equal
protection
clause,
is
that
your
understanding
of
the
argument?
justice
abe
fortas
that
would
have
no
effect
whatever.
that
argument
would
have
no
effect
whatever
as
i
see
it
on
the
validity
of
a
specific
referendum
designed
which
has
the
effect
of
repealing
a
specific
ordinance
passed
by
the
city
council
of
akron.
i
mean
to
say
that
that
argument
it
seems
to
me
to
be
inapplicable
because
the
referendum
machinery
is
available
with
respect
to
all
ordinances
but
here
your
case
is
being
presented
to
us
in
a
very
different
basis.
that
is
to
say
the
basis
of
singling
out
a
particular
kind
of
housing
legislation
namely,
legislation
directed
to
racial
discrimination
and
saying
as
to
that
specific
type
of
housing
legislation,
there
must
be
not
only,
there
must
be
a
special
procedure,
i.e.
submission
to
the
voters.
justice
abe
fortas
does
the
record
before
us
show
--
does
the
record
before
us
show
that
mrs.
hunter
lives
--
now
lives
in
chicago?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
have
problems
about
that.
justice
abe
fortas
as
i
have
problems
about
going
outside
of
the
record
or
something
of
that
sort.
justice
abe
fortas
can
i
ask
you
before
you
go
to
another
point?
justice
abe
fortas
is
there
anywhere
--
is
the
affidavit
referred
to
in
the
complaint
which
appellant
filed
with
the
commission
with
the
mayor
and
the
members
of
the
commission,
is
that
affidavit
in
the
record?
justice
abe
fortas
i
see.
i
haven't
yet
been
able
to
locate
it
but
i
guess
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
the
problem
--
i'm
really
in
trouble
because
there's
it
seems
to
me
a
difference
of
opinion
between
you
and
mr.
carter
as
to
whether
the
state
law
does
cover
this.
i
am
yet
have
been
able
to
find
the
affidavit
setting
forth
the
specific
matters
as
to
which
she
complains
at
the
affidavit
she
filed
with
the
commission.
i
initially
looked
through
the
full
transcript
and
i
haven't
found
it.
justice
abe
fortas
but
i
am
troubled
by
that
difference.
justice
abe
fortas
oh,
you
do.
justice
abe
fortas
thank
you.
justice
abe
fortas
before
you
go
on
with
that,
may
i
see
if
i
can
clear
this
up
in
my
own
mind
anyway.
justice
abe
fortas
if
mr.
jones,
a
resident
of
akron
owns
a
one-family
house
and
he
has
that
on
the
market
for
sale
and
he
refuses
to
sell
it
to
mrs.
hunter
because
she
is
a
negro.
that
would
not
violate
the
state
law,
would
it?
now,
section
4112.02
on
page
10,
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
in
subparagraph
1
refuse
to
sell,
makes
an
unlawful
discriminatory
practice
to
refuse
to
sell
on
a
count
of
race,
etcetera
but
that
applies
only
to
commercial
housing,
doesn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
and
would
not
affect
this
situation.
justice
abe
fortas
now,
i
fail
to
see
anything
else
in
the
state
law,
i
may
be
wrong,
but
i
fail
to
see
anything
else
in
the
state
law
that
would
reach
the
case
that
i
just
put
to
you,
am
i
wrong?
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
right
about
this?
justice
abe
fortas
well
now,
then
you
turn
to
page
13
of
your
brief
and
you
look
at
the
affidavit
that
i
couldn't
search
and
in
that
affidavit,
the
agent,
according
to
the
affidavit,
the
agent
stated
to
mrs.
hunter
that
she
could
not
show
me
any
of
the
houses
on
the
list
because
all
of
the
owners
had
specified
that
they
did
not
wish
their
houses
shown
to
negroes
so
that
it's
at
least
arguable,
isn't
it
that
mrs.
hunter,
the
gravamen
of
mrs.
hunter's
complaint
here
is
that
the
owners
of
individual
houses,
not
commercial
property,
the
individual
houses
refused
to
sell
to
her
and
that
would
not
be
covered
by
the
state
law.
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
think
i
got
the
line
straightened
out
anyway.
thank
you.
justice
abe
fortas
perhaps,
it's
arguable
that
this
case
will
be
more
likely
the
public
utility
charter
provision
if
the
latter
said
that
utility
charters
may
be
issued
to
white
people
without
a
referendum
but
if
any
utility
charters
can
be
issued
to
negroes
then
you
got
to
have
a
referendum.
because
as
i
understand
your
adversary's
argument,
he
is
pitching
his
case
on
that
narrow
point
of
racial
--
alleged
racial
discriminations
and
as
i
understand
this
case,
if
for
example,
the
provision
adopted
here
had
said
that
all
legislation,
all
ordinances
regulating
terms,
conditions,
manner,
etcetera
of
sale
of
real
estate
have
to
be
submitted
to
the
voters,
then
the
same
line
of
argument
would
not
apply.
that's
--
that's
my
understanding
of
his
argument
and
that's
why
i
put
to
you
the
alternative
case
with
respect
to
utility
franchise.
justice
abe
fortas
now,
does
she
have
a

does
