mr.
robert
l.
carter
if
the
court
please.
this
case
is
here
on
appeal
from
the
judgment
of
the
state
of
ohio
which
construed
as
consistent
with
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
a
charter
amendment
to
the
city
of
akron.
the
amendment
is
number
137
and
then
set
out
at
page
37
of
our
record.
and
this
charter
amendment
requires
that
before
any
legislation
designed
to
regulate
housing,
real
property
on
the
basis
of
race
is
enacted
that
it
has
to
be
approved
by
majority
of
the
electorate.
moreover,
it
asserts
that
any
legislation
which
had
been
adopted
with
this
making
this
regulation
would
cease
to
be
effective
until
approved
by
the
majority
of
the
electorate.
the
--
we
contend
that
section
137
is
inconsistent
with
the
fourteenth
amendment
requirements
and
must
fall.
the
facts
are
not
in
dispute
and
are
reasonably
uncomplicated.
in
july
of
1964,
the
city
council
of
akron
enacted
a
fair
housing
ordinance.
it
made
findings
of
fact
that
it
had
certain
of
its
citizens
were
required
to
live
in
segregated
conditions
and
under
unhealthy
and
unsanitary
and
unsafe
conditions
because
of
housing
discrimination.
and
these
kinds
of
discrimination
produced
various
social
evils
which
were
addressed
to
the
health
and
well-being
of
the
city.
it
therefore
established
the
commission
with
power
to
investigate
on
complaints
of
housing
discrimination
and
to
make
findings
and
to
order
compliance
with
the
relief
of
the
discrimination.
it
also
directed
the
city
--
the
director
of
--
the
law
director
of
the
city
to
take
appropriate
action
when
the
order
of
the
commission
was
not
followed.
all
housing
was
covered
by
this.
all
housing
that
was
intended
as
residential
housing
was
covered
by
this
ordinance.
the
--
on
august
the
23rd,
petitions
were
filed
pursuant
to
in
the
initiation
process
which
is
provided
by
the
city
charter
and
pursuant
to
that,
a
sufficient
number
of
signatures
were
secured
and
the
petition
137
went
on
the
ballot.
it
was
voted
upon
at
the
november
23,
1964
election
and
it
was
adopted
by
majority
of
citizens.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
it's
7%
of
the
electorate
vote
so
that
it
varies
from
time
to
time
but
in
any
event,
the
city
council
indicated
that
the
requisite
number
of
signatures
had
been
secured
and
placed
it
on
the
ballot.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
in
the
election
itself,
i
think
that
there
were
about
100,000
votes.
the
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
with
that
i
don't
know.
i
know
that
the
charter
was
adopted
by
a
vote
of
something
like
69,000
to
44,000.
in
january
of
1965,
the
appellant
filed
a
complaint,
made
a
complaint
of
housing
discrimination
and
requested
the
commission
which
had
been
set
up
pursuant
under
this
ordinance
to
act.
the
commission
refused
to
act
and
she
then
went
to
the
law
director.
the
law
director
refused
to
act
and
these
proceedings
therefore
commenced.
after
those,
some
various
procedural
problems
involved
and
they
were
cleared
away
which
i
don't
think
it's
germane
to
this
--
to
the
argument
of
this
appeal
and
then
the
matter
was
defended
and
pressed
on
the
merits
and
on
the
merits,
the
city
defended
and
said
that
the
ordinance
was
no
longer
active
because
of
the
--
this
amendment
section
137
which
i
have
indicated.
the
ohio
supreme
court
held
that
the
137
was
a
classification
but
it
contended
that
it
was
reasonable
because
it
says
that
a
city
in
singling
out
housing
--
racial
regulation
of
housing
on
racial
grounds
for
special
treatment
is
not
acting
arbitrarily
because
of
the
fact
that
this
is
a
highly
emotional
field
and
therefore
it
indicated
that
this
was
a
reasonable
judgment.
we
contend
that
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
that
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
cannot
stand
is
inconsistent
with
the
opinion
of
this
court.
and
we
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
it
could've
been
done
either
way.
as
i
understand
the
process,
the
law
was
suspended.
city
council
could
have
either
by
initiative.
it
could
have
gotten
on
the
ballots.
or
the
city
council
could
have
resurrected
it
and
put
it
on
the
ballot
again
in
which
point
it
would
have
been
voted
upon.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
no,
sir.
because
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
--
not
only
was
there
no
automatic
provision
but
the
provision
was
that
it
had
to
be
put
on
the
ballot
at
the
general
or
regular
election.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
the
last
--
this
past
election
was
put
on
the
ballot.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
it
was
put
on
by
the
city
council?
mr.
robert
l.
carter
by
the
city
council.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
no,
it
did
not.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
it
was
a
close
vote.
the
vote
was
44,000
some
to
44,000.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes.
what
was
--
what
was
put
on
the
ballot
was
a
whether
or
not
--
whether
it
would
put
to
pass
in
city,
whether
or
not
they
would
keep
or
repeal
137.
and
i
might
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
keep
or
repeal.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
137.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
no,
the
open
housing
ordinance
--
what
the
effect
of
repealing
of
137
would
be
to
resurrect.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
which
i
understand.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
the
--
the
city
housing
ordinance
has
not
been
submitted
to
the
voters.
but
the
issue
that
we
have
here
was
submitted.
in
other
words,
whether
or
not
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
sure.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
you
get
the
open
housing
ordinance
to
a
vote
by
having
the
city
council
re-pass
the
law
and
then
it's
submitted
within
30
days
by
referendum
and
it's
placed
on
the
ballot
at
a
general
or
regular
general
election
which
then
this
process
requires
10%
of
the
voters
to
act.
or
voters
may
initiate
a
fair
housing
ordinance
with
77%,
they
would
be
able
to
put
a
petition
with
the
same
fair
housing
ordinance
by
initiation
7%,
get
that
on
the
ballot
and
would
be
voted.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
there
is
a
--
no,
sir.
in
fact,
there
is
a
state
law.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
the
state
--
all
i
can
concert
sir
is
that
the
law
was
enacted
subsequent
to
the
institution
of
this
case.
i
think
it
was
passed
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
that
i
can
approach
it
in
several
angles.
state
law
that's
enacted
is
--
deals
chiefly
with
commercial
housing.
in
other
words,
the
right
to
live
in
a
house
and
to
--
for
residential
properties
is
now
specifically
covered
by
the
state
law.
in
some
respects
it
is.
in
other
words,
there's
advertising
and
things
of
that
kind.
the
state
law
also
is
not
as
broad
as
this
law.
this
is
a
broad
provision.
it
covers
all
residential
housing.
it
has
a
commission
with
power
and
a
commission
can
order
the
compliant.
state
law
is
a
much
weaker
provision
and
i
think
that
as
the
court
say
in
jones
versus
mayer
company,
the
issue
here
it
seems
to
me
is
that
the
state
law
does
not
displace
the
local
initiative
or
the
local
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
--
or
fair
housing
legislation.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
sure.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
my
--
my
contention
is
that
it
does
not.
the
state
law
is
set
out
in
the
appellant's
brief
--
in
the
appellant's
brief
on
the
merits,
at
page
10
and
the
refusal
if
you
will
note,
of
the
unlawful
discrimination
territory
practices,
the
refusal
to
sell,
transfer,
assign,
rent,
or
lease
and
so
forth
is
it
goes
only
to
commercial
houses.
there
are
some
provisions
in
the
law
that
the
statute
does
--
that
covers
personal
residence
but
it
does
not
cover
the
fact
of
renting
or
moving
into
residence.
there
is
some
issue
here
by
the
refusal
to
lend
money,
the
advertising
and
so
forth.
but
it
does
not
have
any
right
to
actually
occupy
personal
residence.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
the
appellant
would
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
the
appellant
would
have
a
remedy
under
the
--
a
general
remedy
under
the
1982,
under
jones
versus
mayer
but
they
would
not
have
the
remedy
of
the
government
administrative
machinery
which
is
provided
by
this
ordinance
plus
the
fact
that
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
the
1968
statute
does
not
apply
to
this
kind
of
housing
at
this
time.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
it
should
have
a
general
remedy
which
i
think
that
this
court
indicated
in
jones
versus
mayer
company
that
even
though
the
1968
act
provided
administrative
machinery
that
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
--
it's
the
1866
law
did
not
displace
it
because
of
the
fact
that
it
was
a
general
remedy
which
--
and
this
--
what
this
provided
was
administrative
machinery
to
effectuate
the
right
which
had
been
granted.
we
think
that
this
case
is
more
of
a
violation
as
a
matter
of
fact
than
reitman
versus
mulkey
because
of
the
fact
that
what
occurs
here
in
reitman
versus
mulkey,
the
proposition
14
could
have
been
seen
as
being
neutral
because
it
didn't
have
--
it
had
nothing
on
the
face
of
it
which
would
indicate
that
this
was
a
racial
matter.
this
in
this
case,
on
the
face
of
the
statute
and
explicitly
of
the
state
of
the
statute
it
is
said
that
no
race
regulations
can
be
passed
without
the
vote
of
the
people
and
we
think
that
this
is
an
explicit
race
regulation
which
makes
this
even
a
stronger
case
than
in
the
reitman
versus
mulkey
because
of
the
fact
that
it
does
involve
and
explicitly
involved
the
government's
hand
in
the
process
of
maintaining
and
supporting
racial
discrimination.
we
also
contend
that
this
can't
be
looked
upon
as
a
mere
repeal
of
the
law.
it's
the
state
were
being
neutral.
what
happened
here
is
that
negroes
to
those
for
whom
the
legislation,
this
kind
of
legislation
is
needed
and
intended
are
now
put
to
a
greater
test,
are
now
put
to
a
greater
burden
to
get
legislation
enacted.
they're
not
in
the
same
position
as
they
were
before
the
fair
housing
law
was
passed.
what
they
must
do
now
is
that
they
must
not
only
convince
the
city
council
which
they
had
to
do
at
the
first
instance
to
enact
a
new
law.
but
they
also
have
to
convince,
they
have
to
go
out
and
get
signatures,
they
have
to
get
7%
or
10%
of
the
population
to
sign
and
that
what
they
also
must
do
is
to
convince
the
majority
of
the
electorate
that
this
kind
of
legislation
should
be
enacted.
now,
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
think
so.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
think
so.
i
--
i
think
i
would
be
because
i
think
that
essentially
what
would
be
occurring
is
that
if
137
were
enacted
without
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
all
it
would
mean
would
be
of
course
under
the
circumstances
that
i
would
not
be
able
to
show
that
the
group
had
been
succeeded
in
getting
a
fair
housing
legislation
through
the
city
council.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
the
only
thing
i
do
say
is
that
the
issue,
it
does
seem
to
me
that
may
sharpen
up
the
issue
somewhat.
because
what
was
involved
in
reitman
versus
mulkey,
the
question
was
whether
this
--
whether
or
not
this
was
a
repeal
of
the
law
and
the
issue
before
the
court
that
the
court
felt
was
an
issue
if
they
have
to
ponder
was
the
fact
that
whether
once
you
had
legislation
of
this
kind,
that
the
constitution
for
it
has
been
repealed.
now,
in
this
particular
instance,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
issue
is
presented
even
more
sharply,
i
think
that
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
oh,
i
think
it
is.
i
think
that
the
reitman
versus
mulkey
--
i
think
that
the
reitman
versus
mulkey
covers
this
case.
i
think
reitman
versus
mulkey
covers
this
case
and
as
i
think
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
think
as
a
matter
of
fact
as
i
said
i
think
it's
even
stronger
case
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
--
than
reitman
versus
mulkey.
although
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
didn't
hear
it.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
didn't
hear
you
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
i
certainly
would
under
any
combination.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
the
respondent
raises
that
on
the
theory
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
agree.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
robert
l.
carter
no,
that
--
i
don't
believe
that
that
can
even
make
--
can
sustain
that
exception.
let
me
tell
you
what
the
tax
legislation
is.
tax
legislation
says
that
86
(a)
to
the
charter
says
that
there
can
be
no
--
the
aggregate
amount
that
may
be
levied
on
real
property
in
any
given
year
has
to
be
at
a
certain
specified
limitation
and
if
that
limitation
can
be
exceeded,
it
can
be
only
be
exceeded
with
the
vote
of
the
people.
there
also
is
a
provision
in
86
(b)
which
says
that
income
taxes
that
are
levied
were
that
income
taxes
being
levied
will
only
last
until
1968,
1963
to
1968
and
that
if
it
is
to
be
extended,
it
has
to
be
by
the
vote
of
the
people.
now,
it's
my
contention
that
the
property
tax
is
not.
it
does
not
meet
this
question
because
what
the
property
tax
limitation
is,
is
that
taxes
in
favor
of
property
owned.
it
is
not
an
invidious
discrimination.
what
it
says
is
that
you
cannot
--
the
city
council
is
being
told
that
you
may
not
tax
property
owners
beyond
a
certain
limitation
without
the
full
approval
of
the
people,
so
that
what
we
have
here
is
the
beneficial
law
for
a
certain
group
of
class
of
citizens
which
they
have
enabled
because
of
their
strength
to
keep
the
city
council
from
moving
alone.
the
income
tax
provision
on
the
other
hand
is
a
provision
which
is
general
and
neutral
and
all
of
the
people
of
the
city
said
is
in
terms
of
income
tax,
they're
experimenting
with
it
apparently
and
they
indicate
that
we're
not
going
to
allow
you
to
extend
it
without
our
approval.
we
don't
believe
that
this
helps
the
respondents
to
answer
to
our
question
to
our
case.
in
our
case,
in
our
argument,
we
still
contend
that
137
is
invidious.
in
--
in
view
of
the
fact
that
what
it
says
to
the
city
council
is
that
you
may
not
pass
any
law
to
the
benefit,
in
terms
of
housing
discrimination
for
the
class
of
people
that
need
it
without
the
approval
of
the
entire
electorate.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
any
ordinance
that
is
passed
is
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
any
ordinance
that
is
passed
is
subject
to
a
referendum.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
oh,
yes.
something
only
if
it's
put
to
referendum
by
initiative
is
not
required
to
go
to
referendum.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
and
if
they
get
the
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
but
this
also
does
not
meet
the
problem
because
of
the
fact
that
the
initiative
and
referendum
of
any
ordinance
need
not
be
at
a
general
or
regular
or
general
election
which
is
required
by
137.
if
an
act
is
passed,
the
initiative
or
referendum
may
be
initiated
any
kind
of
election
and
may
be
initiated
in
a
special
election.
so
that
what
we
have
here
is
that
even
to
that
extent
what
137
has
done
is
to
freeze
and
clog
the
political
process
against
the
enactment
of
law
that's
favorable
in
terms
of
the
removal
explanation.
now,
we
think
that
this
law
is
bad
because
we've
indicated
in
our
brief
because
what
it
does
is
that
it
discriminates.
clearly,
it's
a
racial
classification
and
it
discriminates
clearly
against
the
people
who
need
the
legislation
most.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
equal
protection
clause,
yes.
it's
our
contention
that
the
legislation
such
as
this
which
discriminates
against
groups
of
citizens
as
this
does
that
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
that
as
this
statute
has
been
construed
as
being
a
reasonable
classification
that
it
has
to
have
a
heavier
burden
that
what
the
state
would
have
to
show
in
order
to
sustain
this
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
would
be
that
this
would
be
a
regulation
which
was
absolutely
necessary
for
the
city
of
akron
to
meet
a
various
of
its
valid
objectives
that
it
had
a
right
to
pursue.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
if
the
legislation
were
neutral
on
its
face,
what
i
would
have
to
show
mr.
justice
harlan
would
be
the
fact
that
it's
a
fact.
if
i
could
show
in
effect
that
it
discriminated
it
as
a
matter
of
fact
against
classes
of
citizens,
i
think
i
would
have
the
same
argument.
the
point
here
however
is
that
i
don't
have
to
--
the
voters
have
kept
us
from
being
concerned
about
interpretation.
they
specifically
and
explicitly
and
expressly
indicated
precisely
what
the
statute
was
meant
to
accomplish.
now,
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
said
that
it's
bad
on
its
face
because
it
has
a
racial
classification
and
therefore
is
subject
to
stricter
standard.
secondly,
it
of
course
in
effect,
it
doesn't
affect
the
discrimination
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
a
racial
classification
as
i
understand
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
as
i
understand
the
decisions
of
the
court,
the
decisions
of
the
court
in
mclaughlin
and
loving
have
left
open
the
possibility
of
the
court
approving
a
racial
classification.
the
court
says
--
the
court
said
however
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
didn't
hear
you.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
the
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
the
racial
class
--
an
invidious
racial
classification
it
seems
to
me
is
one
of
course
in
which
i
would
feel
that
the
constitution
reach
and
i
think
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
i
don't
think
so
but
i
think
this
is
why
this
court
has
said
because
of
the
fact
that
there
might
be
racial
classifications
or
legislation
made
to
benefit
certain
groups
of
people
under
certain
needs,
needs
which
they
have,
which
this
court
left
open
in
both
loving
and
in
mclaughlin
versus
florida.
if
the
fact
that
they
are
not
ruling
that
race
classifications
per
se
open.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
you
have
to
go
--
well,
the
first
thing,
it
seems
to
me
mr.
justice
white
is
that
you
go
to
the
face
of
the
statute.
if
i
have
a
race
classification,
what
i
say
by
the
race
classification
is
that
reasonableness
is
not
enough.
i
think
that
once
you
see
that
the
statute
from
that
regard
that
this
is
the
standard
unless
i
understand
that
this
court
has
applied.
once
i
see,
you
see
a
race
classification
as
to
whether
you
will
approve
race
classification
then
you
go
to
its
effect
to
determine
as
a
matter
of
fact
whether
the
cost
of
occasion
is
necessary
for
an
object
that
the
state
is
entitled
to
pursue.
it
seems
to
me
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes,
sir.
and
in
fact
that
it
was
aimed
at
a
specific
fair
housing
ordinance
and
nullified
or
at
least
has
set
it
aside.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
it
has
to
be
a
compelling
state
interest.
it
has
to
be
that
one
that
the
state
can
show
is
necessary.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
in
the
race
classifications,
i
think
the
term
used
is
necessary
for
the
pursuit
of
a
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
i
would
not
--
i
think
that
i
would
not
think
so
but
i'm
not
really
in
the
position
to
say
in
terms
of
the
court.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
that's
right.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
it
would
appear
to
me
mr.
justice
white
that
then
in
terms
of
its
effect,
of
what
the
court
will
look
to
were
to
see
whether
or
not
what
the
state
was
aiming
at.
it
was
an
objective
which
was
a
legitimate
objective
aside
from
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
of
the
state.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
it
has
--
it
has
to
be
compelled
and
it
has
to
be
necessary
for
a
legitimate
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
i'm
not
in
the
position
to
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
alright.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
mr.
justice
white's
question
about
the
repeal?
i
think
that
in
terms
of
answering,
it
seems
to
me
that
akron
has
done
more
than
merely
repealing
the
statute.
now,
what
akron
does
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
it
has
done
that
clause.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
that's
right
but
the
point
that
it's
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
the
--
i
think
it's
a
matter
of
fact
that
we
--
what
we
have
here
are
the
two
bases.
as
you
indicated,
the
ordinance
did
two
things.
the
amendment
to
the
charter
did
two
things.
it
said,
that
fair
housing
ordinance
that
you
have
on
the
statute
books
is
not
cannot
go
into
effect
and
is
suspended
pending
a
vote
of
the
people.
it
said
--
it
said
secondly
that
no
fair
housing
can
passed
or
fair
housing
ordinance
can
be
passed
except
by
this
process.
now,
it
seems
to
me
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
because
the
latter
aspect
of
it
in
--
i
have
been
arguing
i
think
about
both
of
them
because
i
think
that's
the
question
that
mr.
justice
stewart
asked.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
mr.
justice
stewart
said
to
me
i
think
that
would
i
have
to
make
an
argument
about
this
is
the
statute
have
not
been
on
the
books?
couldn't
i
make
the
same
argument
here
if
this
without
any
prior
history
of
fair
housing
that
this
--
there's
the
first
sentence
that
had
fit
in,
and
i
said
of
course
i
would
be.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes,
i
would
have
the
same
constitutional
argument.
i
think
i
would
yes.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
you
don't
have
to
decide
that
a
state
may
not
repeal
an
existing
ordinance.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
don't
think
you
have
to.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
because
of
the
fact
that
that
i
think
that
what
you
have
decide
it
seems
to
me
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
that's
one
thing
the
state
here
but
the
state
did
more
than
that
and
what
the
state
did
more
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
because
of
the
fact
that
if
the
state
having
done
more,
it
seems
to
me
that
in
so
far
as
my
argument
is
concerned
that
it
is
a
simpler
constitutional
question
to
indicate
that
the
state
cannot
single
out
these
people
and
bar
any
legislation
to
some.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
right.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
it
would
appear
to
me
that
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
this
case
is
about
the
fact
that
the
ordinance
of
this
kind,
the
state
has
singled
out
a
particular
class
of
legislation
and
said
that
you
may
not
act
this
without
going
through
certain
processes.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
that
the
state
has
also
said
--
the
state
has
done
more
mr.
justice
white
and
say
that
it
has
repealed
the
ordinance
because
it
says
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
want
you
to
say
that
repeal
is
unconstitutional
with
the
burdens
that
have
been
placed
upon
it
at
the
present
time.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
if
you
say
that
the
burdens
are
unconstitutional,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
issue
as
to
whether
a
simple
repeal
is
unconstitutional
is
not
my
case.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
that's
right.
and
as
far
as
we're
concerned
your
honor,
our
view
is
that
we
are
here
--
this
ordinance
ought
to
be
struck
down
for
the
reasons
that
have
been
indicated
that
it's
a
violation
of
equal
protection
clause.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
if
the
court
please.
this
case
is
here
on
appeal
from
the
judgment
of
the
state
of
ohio
which
construed
as
consistent
with
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
a
charter
amendment
to
the
city
of
akron.
the
amendment
is
number
137
and
then
set
out
at
page
37
of
our
record.
and
this
charter
amendment
requires
that
before
any
legislation
designed
to
regulate
housing,
real
property
on
the
basis
of
race
is
enacted
that
it
has
to
be
approved
by
majority
of
the
electorate.
moreover,
it
asserts
that
any
legislation
which
had
been
adopted
with
this
making
this
regulation
would
cease
to
be
effective
until
approved
by
the
majority
of
the
electorate.
the
--
we
contend
that
section
137
is
inconsistent
with
the
fourteenth
amendment
requirements
and
must
fall.
the
facts
are
not
in
dispute
and
are
reasonably
uncomplicated.
in
july
of
1964,
the
city
council
of
akron
enacted
a
fair
housing
ordinance.
it
made
findings
of
fact
that
it
had
certain
of
its
citizens
were
required
to
live
in
segregated
conditions
and
under
unhealthy
and
unsanitary
and
unsafe
conditions
because
of
housing
discrimination.
and
these
kinds
of
discrimination
produced
various
social
evils
which
were
addressed
to
the
health
and
well-being
of
the
city.
it
therefore
established
the
commission
with
power
to
investigate
on
complaints
of
housing
discrimination
and
to
make
findings
and
to
order
compliance
with
the
relief
of
the
discrimination.
it
also
directed
the
city
--
the
director
of
--
the
law
director
of
the
city
to
take
appropriate
action
when
the
order
of
the
commission
was
not
followed.
all
housing
was
covered
by
this.
all
housing
that
was
intended
as
residential
housing
was
covered
by
this
ordinance.
the
--
on
august
the
23rd,
petitions
were
filed
pursuant
to
in
the
initiation
process
which
is
provided
by
the
city
charter
and
pursuant
to
that,
a
sufficient
number
of
signatures
were
secured
and
the
petition
137
went
on
the
ballot.
it
was
voted
upon
at
the
november
23,
1964
election
and
it
was
adopted
by
majority
of
citizens.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
it's
7%
of
the
electorate
vote
so
that
it
varies
from
time
to
time
but
in
any
event,
the
city
council
indicated
that
the
requisite
number
of
signatures
had
been
secured
and
placed
it
on
the
ballot.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
in
the
election
itself,
i
think
that
there
were
about
100,000
votes.
the
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
with
that
i
don't
know.
i
know
that
the
charter
was
adopted
by
a
vote
of
something
like
69,000
to
44,000.
in
january
of
1965,
the
appellant
filed
a
complaint,
made
a
complaint
of
housing
discrimination
and
requested
the
commission
which
had
been
set
up
pursuant
under
this
ordinance
to
act.
the
commission
refused
to
act
and
she
then
went
to
the
law
director.
the
law
director
refused
to
act
and
these
proceedings
therefore
commenced.
after
those,
some
various
procedural
problems
involved
and
they
were
cleared
away
which
i
don't
think
it's
germane
to
this
--
to
the
argument
of
this
appeal
and
then
the
matter
was
defended
and
pressed
on
the
merits
and
on
the
merits,
the
city
defended
and
said
that
the
ordinance
was
no
longer
active
because
of
the
--
this
amendment
section
137
which
i
have
indicated.
the
ohio
supreme
court
held
that
the
137
was
a
classification
but
it
contended
that
it
was
reasonable
because
it
says
that
a
city
in
singling
out
housing
--
racial
regulation
of
housing
on
racial
grounds
for
special
treatment
is
not
acting
arbitrarily
because
of
the
fact
that
this
is
a
highly
emotional
field
and
therefore
it
indicated
that
this
was
a
reasonable
judgment.
we
contend
that
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
that
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
cannot
stand
is
inconsistent
with
the
opinion
of
this
court.
and
we
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
it
could've
been
done
either
way.
as
i
understand
the
process,
the
law
was
suspended.
city
council
could
have
either
by
initiative.
it
could
have
gotten
on
the
ballots.
or
the
city
council
could
have
resurrected
it
and
put
it
on
the
ballot
again
in
which
point
it
would
have
been
voted
upon.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
no,
sir.
because
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
--
not
only
was
there
no
automatic
provision
but
the
provision
was
that
it
had
to
be
put
on
the
ballot
at
the
general
or
regular
election.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
the
last
--
this
past
election
was
put
on
the
ballot.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
it
was
put
on
by
the
city
council?
mr.
robert
l.
carter
by
the
city
council.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
no,
it
did
not.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
it
was
a
close
vote.
the
vote
was
44,000
some
to
44,000.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes.
what
was
--
what
was
put
on
the
ballot
was
a
whether
or
not
--
whether
it
would
put
to
pass
in
city,
whether
or
not
they
would
keep
or
repeal
137.
and
i
might
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
keep
or
repeal.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
137.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
no,
the
open
housing
ordinance
--
what
the
effect
of
repealing
of
137
would
be
to
resurrect.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
which
i
understand.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
the
--
the
city
housing
ordinance
has
not
been
submitted
to
the
voters.
but
the
issue
that
we
have
here
was
submitted.
in
other
words,
whether
or
not
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
sure.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
you
get
the
open
housing
ordinance
to
a
vote
by
having
the
city
council
re-pass
the
law
and
then
it's
submitted
within
30
days
by
referendum
and
it's
placed
on
the
ballot
at
a
general
or
regular
general
election
which
then
this
process
requires
10%
of
the
voters
to
act.
or
voters
may
initiate
a
fair
housing
ordinance
with
77%,
they
would
be
able
to
put
a
petition
with
the
same
fair
housing
ordinance
by
initiation
7%,
get
that
on
the
ballot
and
would
be
voted.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
there
is
a
--
no,
sir.
in
fact,
there
is
a
state
law.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
the
state
--
all
i
can
concert
sir
is
that
the
law
was
enacted
subsequent
to
the
institution
of
this
case.
i
think
it
was
passed
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
that
i
can
approach
it
in
several
angles.
state
law
that's
enacted
is
--
deals
chiefly
with
commercial
housing.
in
other
words,
the
right
to
live
in
a
house
and
to
--
for
residential
properties
is
now
specifically
covered
by
the
state
law.
in
some
respects
it
is.
in
other
words,
there's
advertising
and
things
of
that
kind.
the
state
law
also
is
not
as
broad
as
this
law.
this
is
a
broad
provision.
it
covers
all
residential
housing.
it
has
a
commission
with
power
and
a
commission
can
order
the
compliant.
state
law
is
a
much
weaker
provision
and
i
think
that
as
the
court
say
in
jones
versus
mayer
company,
the
issue
here
it
seems
to
me
is
that
the
state
law
does
not
displace
the
local
initiative
or
the
local
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
--
or
fair
housing
legislation.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
sure.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
my
--
my
contention
is
that
it
does
not.
the
state
law
is
set
out
in
the
appellant's
brief
--
in
the
appellant's
brief
on
the
merits,
at
page
10
and
the
refusal
if
you
will
note,
of
the
unlawful
discrimination
territory
practices,
the
refusal
to
sell,
transfer,
assign,
rent,
or
lease
and
so
forth
is
it
goes
only
to
commercial
houses.
there
are
some
provisions
in
the
law
that
the
statute
does
--
that
covers
personal
residence
but
it
does
not
cover
the
fact
of
renting
or
moving
into
residence.
there
is
some
issue
here
by
the
refusal
to
lend
money,
the
advertising
and
so
forth.
but
it
does
not
have
any
right
to
actually
occupy
personal
residence.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
the
appellant
would
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
the
appellant
would
have
a
remedy
under
the
--
a
general
remedy
under
the
1982,
under
jones
versus
mayer
but
they
would
not
have
the
remedy
of
the
government
administrative
machinery
which
is
provided
by
this
ordinance
plus
the
fact
that
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
the
1968
statute
does
not
apply
to
this
kind
of
housing
at
this
time.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
it
should
have
a
general
remedy
which
i
think
that
this
court
indicated
in
jones
versus
mayer
company
that
even
though
the
1968
act
provided
administrative
machinery
that
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
--
it's
the
1866
law
did
not
displace
it
because
of
the
fact
that
it
was
a
general
remedy
which
--
and
this
--
what
this
provided
was
administrative
machinery
to
effectuate
the
right
which
had
been
granted.
we
think
that
this
case
is
more
of
a
violation
as
a
matter
of
fact
than
reitman
versus
mulkey
because
of
the
fact
that
what
occurs
here
in
reitman
versus
mulkey,
the
proposition
14
could
have
been
seen
as
being
neutral
because
it
didn't
have
--
it
had
nothing
on
the
face
of
it
which
would
indicate
that
this
was
a
racial
matter.
this
in
this
case,
on
the
face
of
the
statute
and
explicitly
of
the
state
of
the
statute
it
is
said
that
no
race
regulations
can
be
passed
without
the
vote
of
the
people
and
we
think
that
this
is
an
explicit
race
regulation
which
makes
this
even
a
stronger
case
than
in
the
reitman
versus
mulkey
because
of
the
fact
that
it
does
involve
and
explicitly
involved
the
government's
hand
in
the
process
of
maintaining
and
supporting
racial
discrimination.
we
also
contend
that
this
can't
be
looked
upon
as
a
mere
repeal
of
the
law.
it's
the
state
were
being
neutral.
what
happened
here
is
that
negroes
to
those
for
whom
the
legislation,
this
kind
of
legislation
is
needed
and
intended
are
now
put
to
a
greater
test,
are
now
put
to
a
greater
burden
to
get
legislation
enacted.
they're
not
in
the
same
position
as
they
were
before
the
fair
housing
law
was
passed.
what
they
must
do
now
is
that
they
must
not
only
convince
the
city
council
which
they
had
to
do
at
the
first
instance
to
enact
a
new
law.
but
they
also
have
to
convince,
they
have
to
go
out
and
get
signatures,
they
have
to
get
7%
or
10%
of
the
population
to
sign
and
that
what
they
also
must
do
is
to
convince
the
majority
of
the
electorate
that
this
kind
of
legislation
should
be
enacted.
now,
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
think
so.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
think
so.
i
--
i
think
i
would
be
because
i
think
that
essentially
what
would
be
occurring
is
that
if
137
were
enacted
without
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
all
it
would
mean
would
be
of
course
under
the
circumstances
that
i
would
not
be
able
to
show
that
the
group
had
been
succeeded
in
getting
a
fair
housing
legislation
through
the
city
council.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
the
only
thing
i
do
say
is
that
the
issue,
it
does
seem
to
me
that
may
sharpen
up
the
issue
somewhat.
because
what
was
involved
in
reitman
versus
mulkey,
the
question
was
whether
this
--
whether
or
not
this
was
a
repeal
of
the
law
and
the
issue
before
the
court
that
the
court
felt
was
an
issue
if
they
have
to
ponder
was
the
fact
that
whether
once
you
had
legislation
of
this
kind,
that
the
constitution
for
it
has
been
repealed.
now,
in
this
particular
instance,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
issue
is
presented
even
more
sharply,
i
think
that
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
oh,
i
think
it
is.
i
think
that
the
reitman
versus
mulkey
--
i
think
that
the
reitman
versus
mulkey
covers
this
case.
i
think
reitman
versus
mulkey
covers
this
case
and
as
i
think
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
think
as
a
matter
of
fact
as
i
said
i
think
it's
even
stronger
case
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
--
than
reitman
versus
mulkey.
although
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
didn't
hear
it.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
didn't
hear
you
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
i
certainly
would
under
any
combination.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
the
respondent
raises
that
on
the
theory
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
agree.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
robert
l.
carter
no,
that
--
i
don't
believe
that
that
can
even
make
--
can
sustain
that
exception.
let
me
tell
you
what
the
tax
legislation
is.
tax
legislation
says
that
86
(a)
to
the
charter
says
that
there
can
be
no
--
the
aggregate
amount
that
may
be
levied
on
real
property
in
any
given
year
has
to
be
at
a
certain
specified
limitation
and
if
that
limitation
can
be
exceeded,
it
can
be
only
be
exceeded
with
the
vote
of
the
people.
there
also
is
a
provision
in
86
(b)
which
says
that
income
taxes
that
are
levied
were
that
income
taxes
being
levied
will
only
last
until
1968,
1963
to
1968
and
that
if
it
is
to
be
extended,
it
has
to
be
by
the
vote
of
the
people.
now,
it's
my
contention
that
the
property
tax
is
not.
it
does
not
meet
this
question
because
what
the
property
tax
limitation
is,
is
that
taxes
in
favor
of
property
owned.
it
is
not
an
invidious
discrimination.
what
it
says
is
that
you
cannot
--
the
city
council
is
being
told
that
you
may
not
tax
property
owners
beyond
a
certain
limitation
without
the
full
approval
of
the
people,
so
that
what
we
have
here
is
the
beneficial
law
for
a
certain
group
of
class
of
citizens
which
they
have
enabled
because
of
their
strength
to
keep
the
city
council
from
moving
alone.
the
income
tax
provision
on
the
other
hand
is
a
provision
which
is
general
and
neutral
and
all
of
the
people
of
the
city
said
is
in
terms
of
income
tax,
they're
experimenting
with
it
apparently
and
they
indicate
that
we're
not
going
to
allow
you
to
extend
it
without
our
approval.
we
don't
believe
that
this
helps
the
respondents
to
answer
to
our
question
to
our
case.
in
our
case,
in
our
argument,
we
still
contend
that
137
is
invidious.
in
--
in
view
of
the
fact
that
what
it
says
to
the
city
council
is
that
you
may
not
pass
any
law
to
the
benefit,
in
terms
of
housing
discrimination
for
the
class
of
people
that
need
it
without
the
approval
of
the
entire
electorate.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
any
ordinance
that
is
passed
is
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
any
ordinance
that
is
passed
is
subject
to
a
referendum.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
oh,
yes.
something
only
if
it's
put
to
referendum
by
initiative
is
not
required
to
go
to
referendum.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
and
if
they
get
the
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
but
this
also
does
not
meet
the
problem
because
of
the
fact
that
the
initiative
and
referendum
of
any
ordinance
need
not
be
at
a
general
or
regular
or
general
election
which
is
required
by
137.
if
an
act
is
passed,
the
initiative
or
referendum
may
be
initiated
any
kind
of
election
and
may
be
initiated
in
a
special
election.
so
that
what
we
have
here
is
that
even
to
that
extent
what
137
has
done
is
to
freeze
and
clog
the
political
process
against
the
enactment
of
law
that's
favorable
in
terms
of
the
removal
explanation.
now,
we
think
that
this
law
is
bad
because
we've
indicated
in
our
brief
because
what
it
does
is
that
it
discriminates.
clearly,
it's
a
racial
classification
and
it
discriminates
clearly
against
the
people
who
need
the
legislation
most.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
equal
protection
clause,
yes.
it's
our
contention
that
the
legislation
such
as
this
which
discriminates
against
groups
of
citizens
as
this
does
that
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
that
as
this
statute
has
been
construed
as
being
a
reasonable
classification
that
it
has
to
have
a
heavier
burden
that
what
the
state
would
have
to
show
in
order
to
sustain
this
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
would
be
that
this
would
be
a
regulation
which
was
absolutely
necessary
for
the
city
of
akron
to
meet
a
various
of
its
valid
objectives
that
it
had
a
right
to
pursue.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
if
the
legislation
were
neutral
on
its
face,
what
i
would
have
to
show
mr.
justice
harlan
would
be
the
fact
that
it's
a
fact.
if
i
could
show
in
effect
that
it
discriminated
it
as
a
matter
of
fact
against
classes
of
citizens,
i
think
i
would
have
the
same
argument.
the
point
here
however
is
that
i
don't
have
to
--
the
voters
have
kept
us
from
being
concerned
about
interpretation.
they
specifically
and
explicitly
and
expressly
indicated
precisely
what
the
statute
was
meant
to
accomplish.
now,
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
said
that
it's
bad
on
its
face
because
it
has
a
racial
classification
and
therefore
is
subject
to
stricter
standard.
secondly,
it
of
course
in
effect,
it
doesn't
affect
the
discrimination
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
a
racial
classification
as
i
understand
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
as
i
understand
the
decisions
of
the
court,
the
decisions
of
the
court
in
mclaughlin
and
loving
have
left
open
the
possibility
of
the
court
approving
a
racial
classification.
the
court
says
--
the
court
said
however
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
didn't
hear
you.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
the
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
the
racial
class
--
an
invidious
racial
classification
it
seems
to
me
is
one
of
course
in
which
i
would
feel
that
the
constitution
reach
and
i
think
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
i
don't
think
so
but
i
think
this
is
why
this
court
has
said
because
of
the
fact
that
there
might
be
racial
classifications
or
legislation
made
to
benefit
certain
groups
of
people
under
certain
needs,
needs
which
they
have,
which
this
court
left
open
in
both
loving
and
in
mclaughlin
versus
florida.
if
the
fact
that
they
are
not
ruling
that
race
classifications
per
se
open.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
you
have
to
go
--
well,
the
first
thing,
it
seems
to
me
mr.
justice
white
is
that
you
go
to
the
face
of
the
statute.
if
i
have
a
race
classification,
what
i
say
by
the
race
classification
is
that
reasonableness
is
not
enough.
i
think
that
once
you
see
that
the
statute
from
that
regard
that
this
is
the
standard
unless
i
understand
that
this
court
has
applied.
once
i
see,
you
see
a
race
classification
as
to
whether
you
will
approve
race
classification
then
you
go
to
its
effect
to
determine
as
a
matter
of
fact
whether
the
cost
of
occasion
is
necessary
for
an
object
that
the
state
is
entitled
to
pursue.
it
seems
to
me
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes,
sir.
and
in
fact
that
it
was
aimed
at
a
specific
fair
housing
ordinance
and
nullified
or
at
least
has
set
it
aside.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
it
has
to
be
a
compelling
state
interest.
it
has
to
be
that
one
that
the
state
can
show
is
necessary.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
in
the
race
classifications,
i
think
the
term
used
is
necessary
for
the
pursuit
of
a
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
i
would
not
--
i
think
that
i
would
not
think
so
but
i'm
not
really
in
the
position
to
say
in
terms
of
the
court.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
that's
right.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
it
would
appear
to
me
mr.
justice
white
that
then
in
terms
of
its
effect,
of
what
the
court
will
look
to
were
to
see
whether
or
not
what
the
state
was
aiming
at.
it
was
an
objective
which
was
a
legitimate
objective
aside
from
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
of
the
state.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
it
has
--
it
has
to
be
compelled
and
it
has
to
be
necessary
for
a
legitimate
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
i'm
not
in
the
position
to
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
alright.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
mr.
justice
white's
question
about
the
repeal?
i
think
that
in
terms
of
answering,
it
seems
to
me
that
akron
has
done
more
than
merely
repealing
the
statute.
now,
what
akron
does
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
it
has
done
that
clause.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
that's
right
but
the
point
that
it's
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
the
--
i
think
it's
a
matter
of
fact
that
we
--
what
we
have
here
are
the
two
bases.
as
you
indicated,
the
ordinance
did
two
things.
the
amendment
to
the
charter
did
two
things.
it
said,
that
fair
housing
ordinance
that
you
have
on
the
statute
books
is
not
cannot
go
into
effect
and
is
suspended
pending
a
vote
of
the
people.
it
said
--
it
said
secondly
that
no
fair
housing
can
passed
or
fair
housing
ordinance
can
be
passed
except
by
this
process.
now,
it
seems
to
me
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
because
the
latter
aspect
of
it
in
--
i
have
been
arguing
i
think
about
both
of
them
because
i
think
that's
the
question
that
mr.
justice
stewart
asked.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
mr.
justice
stewart
said
to
me
i
think
that
would
i
have
to
make
an
argument
about
this
is
the
statute
have
not
been
on
the
books?
couldn't
i
make
the
same
argument
here
if
this
without
any
prior
history
of
fair
housing
that
this
--
there's
the
first
sentence
that
had
fit
in,
and
i
said
of
course
i
would
be.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes,
i
would
have
the
same
constitutional
argument.
i
think
i
would
yes.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
you
don't
have
to
decide
that
a
state
may
not
repeal
an
existing
ordinance.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
don't
think
you
have
to.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
because
of
the
fact
that
that
i
think
that
what
you
have
decide
it
seems
to
me
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
that's
one
thing
the
state
here
but
the
state
did
more
than
that
and
what
the
state
did
more
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
because
of
the
fact
that
if
the
state
having
done
more,
it
seems
to
me
that
in
so
far
as
my
argument
is
concerned
that
it
is
a
simpler
constitutional
question
to
indicate
that
the
state
cannot
single
out
these
people
and
bar
any
legislation
to
some.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
right.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
it
would
appear
to
me
that
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
this
case
is
about
the
fact
that
the
ordinance
of
this
kind,
the
state
has
singled
out
a
particular
class
of
legislation
and
said
that
you
may
not
act
this
without
going
through
certain
processes.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
that
the
state
has
also
said
--
the
state
has
done
more
mr.
justice
white
and
say
that
it
has
repealed
the
ordinance
because
it
says
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
want
you
to
say
that
repeal
is
unconstitutional
with
the
burdens
that
have
been
placed
upon
it
at
the
present
time.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
if
you
say
that
the
burdens
are
unconstitutional,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
issue
as
to
whether
a
simple
repeal
is
unconstitutional
is
not
my
case.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
that's
right.
and
as
far
as
we're
concerned
your
honor,
our
view
is
that
we
are
here
--
this
ordinance
ought
to
be
struck
down
for
the
reasons
that
have
been
indicated
that
it's
a
violation
of
equal
protection
clause.
