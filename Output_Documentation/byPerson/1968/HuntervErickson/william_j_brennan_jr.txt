justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
there
a
large
number
of
votes
mr.
carter
in
election
itself?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
proportion
is
that
on?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
was
to
keep
or
repeal?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
137?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
the
open
housing
ordinance
itself
has
not
been
voted
on,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at
is
--
i
gather
if
137
is
constitutional
and
valid
then
the
only
way
the
open
housing
ordinance
can
ever
become
operative
is
that
it
go
on
the
ballot
to
be
approved
under
137
and
that
is
not
what
was
submitted
at
this
past
election.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
has
it
ever
been
submitted?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
the
repealer
of
137.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
may
i
get
back
to
mr.
justice
white
asked
you
earlier?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
how
do
you
get
under
137
the
open
housing
ordinance
to
a
vote?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
tell
me
mr.
carter,
you
look
then
you
say
for
a
justifiable
state
interest.
now,
what
in
this
instance
what's
your
standard,
a
compelling
state
interest
to
simply
rational,
which?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
we
said
compelling
i
think
in
first
amendment
area
but
have
we
said
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
different
from
compelling?
and
is
that
what
a
greater
burden
on
the
state
to
say
compelling
rather
than
necessary?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
in
any
event,
you
think
necessary
or
compelling
are
different
from
mere
rationality?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
i
understand
you
mr.
claiborne
that
if
instead
of
putting
137
to
initiative
as
they
did,
they
had
put
a
repealer
of
the
open
housing
law
to
referendum
by
initiative,
you're
suggesting
you
might
still
be
here
with
the
equal
protection
argument
but
that
you
don't
have
to
reach
that
question
in
this
case,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
--
i
understand
but
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
incidentally,
does
that,
that
toledo
case
raised
the
issue
of
putting
the
original
open
housing
ordinance
to
referendum?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
this
case
needed
to
decide
that
necessarily?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
your
state
court
say
whether
it
did
or
didn't
cover
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
isn't
it
a
matter
of
state
law
whether
or
not
the
state
statute
covers
this
complaint?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
how
we
can't
resolve
that
question?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
but
the
point
is,
it's
an
issue
at
all
we
can't
decide,
can
we?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
must
say
mr.
vinopal,
i
have
trouble
seeing
how
we
can
accept
your
insistence
that
the
state
law
indeed
preempts
whatever
words
you
want
to
use,
despises
any
state
--
municipal
regulation
in
this
if
your
state
courts
haven't
said
so.
how
can
we
proceed
on
this
case
on
that
premise?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
if
it
is,
i
still
don't
see
--
that
enables
this
court
to
escape
the
determination
on
the
constitutional
question
that's
been
presented
to
her.
i
gather
that's
the
whole
gist
of
your
argument,
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
carter,
how
do
you
answer
justice
white's
question?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
has
done
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there
are
two
sentences
that
were
put.
i
gather
your
or
am
i
wrong?
what
your
particular
concern,
would
it
that
sentencing,
any
such
ordinance
in
effect
shall
seek
to
be
effective
until
approved
by
the
electorate.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
if
that
--
if
you
will
prevail
as
to
that
sentence,
is
that
the
end
of
the
case
without
reaching
the
first
sentence?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
there
a
large
number
of
votes
mr.
carter
in
election
itself?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
proportion
is
that

justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
was
to
keep
or
repeal?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
137?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
the
open
housing
ordinance
itself
has
not
been
voted
on,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.

well,

justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
the
repealer
of
137.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
may
i
get
back
to
mr.
justice
white
asked
you
earlier?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
how
do
you
get
under
137
the
open

ordinance
to
a
vote?
