mr.
j.
edward
thornton
now
push
the
drummer
case.
this
is
the
drummer
case,
this
was
just
different.
the
drummer
case
is
the
states
have
sought
to
license
the
solicitation
of
orders
in
the
state
out
of
this
series
of
events.
this
court
has
unanimously
so
far
as
i
recall
held
that
you
cannot
split
them
up
into
solicitation
and
put
the
tax
on
that
--
where
there
is
this
interstate
activity
throughout.
mr.
j.
edward
thornton
true.
mr.
j.
edward
thornton
that’s
true.
now
of
course,
response
number
one,
this
case
doesn’t
involve
j.c.
penny
as
the
court
is
aware,
the
assessment
was
made
against
us.
and
in
the
appendix
it’s
pretty
clear
that
the
state
was
very
anxious
to
see
to
it
that
no
agency
was
developed
between
penny
and
tax
payer
and
this
is
true,
there
isn’t
any
agency.
but
this
is
a
slightly
different
case
than
the
drummer
case
as
you
say
where
he
has
no
claim.
mr.
j.
edward
thornton
well,
maybe
your
honor
recalls
the
city
case,
which
is
before
this
court
and
we
went
off
on
that
point
there
and
we
don’t
think
we
should
have
gone
off
on
it.
but
nevertheless,
there
they
insisted
that
my
suit
for
declaratory
judgment
to
hold
up
this,
fifty
dollar
a
day
license,
which
of
course
this
is
destructive.
i
mean
this
stands
we
are
gone,
we
can’t
sell
it
up
for
$0.59
maybe
pictures
to
make
that
kind
of
a
license.
but
there,
after
we
got
to
court
they
met
us
by
saying
well
you’re
the
wrong
person
and
we
said,
no,
you
tried
to
put
in
jail
and
we
are
the
ones
that’s
interested,
we
are
the
ones
that’s
going
to
pay
it
and
this
is
not
the
j.c.
penny,
it’s
not
quite
like
a
leased
section
of
a
department
store,
where
there,
you
know
the
department
store
will
get
an
overall
catch
all
license
and
then
they
will
lease
out
various
parts
of
the
departments
to.
but
we
are
not
quite
that,
we
come
and
go,
we
come
and
go
at
penny’s.
mr.
j.
edward
thornton
well
somewhat,
yes
that’s
true,
but
now
i
would
like
to
emphasize
one
thing,
we
deliberately
do
business
this
way.
that
is
to
say
we
want
a
local
business
where
a
disgruntle
customer
or
anyone
like
that
has
someone
to
go
to.
we
are
not
unaware
of
the
fact
that
there
has
been
criticism
of
transient
photographers,
just
as
there
has
been
criticism
of
transient
operators
of
any
kind,
where
a
man
spends
his
money
and
can
protect
himself.
so
we
are
very
proud
of
our
product,
we
think
we
have
a
good
baby
picture.
but
we
want
the
customer
to
know
that
he’s
got
someone
with
this
sort
of
reputation
that
j.c.
penny
has,
that
he
can
come
to
see
about
us
and
this
is,
we
deliberately
encourage
that
but
we
want
to,
because
we
think
that’s
good.
mr.
j.
edward
thornton
well,
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
edward
thornton
well
we
of
course,
we
say
the
one
part
is
not
taxable,
but
that
is
correct.
we
are
saying
that
the
licensing
us
--
mr.
j.
edward
thornton
well
--
mr.
j.
edward
thornton
and
of
course
an
ad
valorem
tax
i
don’t
--
that
would
be
something
else
of
course.
gross
receipts
tax,
i’m
not
sure
about
those.
certainly
a
net
income
tax,
i’m
not
sure
about
those.
but
here
it
is
a
license
and
it
is
a
license
on
the
doing
of
this
kind
of
business
and
so
--
mr.
j.
edward
thornton
that’s
correct.
mr.
j.
edward
thornton
that’s
correct.
mr.
j.
edward
thornton
that’s
correct.
mr.
j.
edward
thornton
that’s
correct.
mr.
j.
edward
thornton
that’s
correct,
we
are
not.
we
are
not.
mr.
j.
edward
thornton
no,
expect
in
so
far
--
mr.
j.
edward
thornton
as
a
client
in
this
case.
but,
that’s
the
only
discriminatory
feature
that
we
are
raising
is
the
discriminatory
because
of
the
application
in
this
case.
mr.
j.
edward
thornton
well,
it
discriminates
against
those
who
send
exposed
film
in
the
state,
out
of
the
state.
yes
sir.
but
that’s
the
only
part
and
but
the
objection
is
commerce
clause,
you
see
this
is
discriminatory
against
interstate
commerce
and
so
far
as
i
know
that
has
never
been
recognized.
mr.
j.
edward
thornton
well
no.
but
we
are
interested
in
the
commerce
clause.
this
is
point
under
which
we
developed
the
case
and
the
discriminatory
aspect
of
it
is
by
reason
--
mr.
j.
edward
thornton
well,
the
--
mr.
j.
edward
thornton
no.
i
would
not
read.
i
state
that
the
alabama
can
make
a
difference
between
itinerant
and
fixed
location
photography.
we
raise
no
point
on
that.
mr.
j.
edward
thornton
well,
this
--
mr.
j.
edward
thornton
well,
this
of
course
is
the
plot
we
want
most
of
all,
but
if
i
may
on
page
27
of
the
brief,
the
reason
they
held
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
held,
the
reason
they
held
that
we
were
subject
to
a
transient
or
itinerant
license,
was
because
it
says
this,
true
in
the
branch
operation,
this
had
to
do
with
olan
mills
case,
page
27,
there
is
a
fixed
location.
but
it
sends
its
film
back
to
chattanooga
to
be
processed
and
the
pictures
are
ultimately
made
in
chattanooga.
now
on
this
basis
you
see
it
was
because
of
this
interstate
activity
that
the
transient
or
the
$5
a
week
license
is
imposed
rather
than
the
$25
a
year
license.
now
we
say
this
is
a
direct
discrimination
against
interstate
activity.
now
as
to
the
equal
protection
clause,
as
to
the
state
making
a
difference
between
itinerant
photographers
and
resident
photographers,
we
may
make
no
point
on
that.
have
i
made
myself
reasonably
clear?
i
would
reserve
the
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
j.
edward
thornton
i
just
have
a
word.
i
think
the
facts
in
the
graves
case
may
be
of
some
importance.
olan
mills
at
that
time
was
engaged
in
a
two-stage
operation.
it
solicitors
who
went
through
the
state
soliciting
orders.
it
had
a
photographer
who
followed.
now
when
the
photographer
came
through,
they
arrested
him
for
not
having
a
transient
photographer’s
license.
question
number
one
was,
is
the
mere
exposure
of
film
engaging
in
the
business
of
photography,
and
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
held
it
was.
it
being
so
essential,
a
part
of
the
photography
business
that
a
license
owned
photography
generally
would
apply
to
the
mere
exposure
of
film.
now
it’s
that
holding
that
comes
over
into
these
cases
here,
where
they
say,
well
now
we
have
already
held
that
the
license
is
only
on,
now
that’s
not
quite
true,
it
was
true
in
the
graves
case,
because
that’s
all
graves
did.
but
they’ve
now
come
along
and
said,
but
that’s
all
you
have
to
do
in
order
to
be
subjected
to
the
license.
this
is
true,
but
it’s
true
in
a
sort
of
a
backhanded
fashion
but
nevertheless
it
does
show
that
the
license
is
on
the
mere
exposure
of
film
and
we’re
taking
the
position
that
when
that
is
connected
with
the
entire
transaction,
which
goes
across
the
state
line,
that
the
state
is
not
--
mr.
j.
edward
thornton
i
believe
that
would
be
the
correct
construction.
mr.
j.
edward
thornton
no,
on
the
$25
license
in
montgomery
on
the
$5
one?
mr.
j.
edward
thornton
that’s
this
case.
mr.
j.
edward
thornton
that
is
this
case.
but
here
you
see,
the
point
is
that
we
were
taking
pictures
at
a
fixed
location
at
penny’s.
mr.
j.
edward
thornton
well,
the
going
out
of
the
state
is
what
makes
the
photography
at
a
fixed
location
a
transient
operation.
mr.
j.
edward
thornton
if
it’s
already
a
transient
operation
i
don’t
believe
whether
he
develops
it
in
the
state
or
out
of
the
state
would
make
any
difference.
mr.
j.
edward
thornton
well,
no,
no.
the
reason
we
got
the
$5
a
week,
there
is
a
reason
we
became
a
transient.
i’m
repeating
myself
a
little
bit.
we
take
pictures
at
--
we
exposed
film
at
a
fixed
location.
now
that
should
be
$25
a
year
if
a
license
is
on
it,
of
course
we
would
contest
that
i
think
we
are
contesting
license
or
could
we
say
in
the
interstate
commerce.
but
if
the
license
at
a
fixed
location
with
charges,
it
would
be
$25
a
year.
but
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
we
send
it
outside
--
mr.
j.
edward
thornton
that’s
correct.
that’s
exactly
right
and
that’s
my
last
point.
we
guess
it’s
right
after
--
and
i
don’t
want
you
to
ever
get
that,
i
hope
you
never
get
to
that
point,
because
you
see
they
can
cure
that
so
easily,
then
we’ll
be
back
in
court,
we
want
to
the
first
one.
mr.
j.
edward
thornton
what.
mr.
j.
edward
thornton
what’s
that?
mr.
j.
edward
thornton
well,
they
would
just
demand
the
license
and
say
that
regardless
of
where
the
film
is
developed,
the
license
would
be
$5
a
week.
mr.
j.
edward
thornton
for
transient
photographers.
mr.
j.
edward
thornton
well
the
reason
they
proved
we
were
a
transient
here
was
because
we
sent
it
out.
mr.
j.
edward
thornton
well,
my
part
is
that
they
might
cure
that
by
eliminating
the
discriminatory
nature
of
the
tax,
because
of
the
interstate
activity.
this
they
could
cure.
mr.
j.
edward
thornton
oh
yes,
oh
yes.
mr.
j.
edward
thornton
that’s
correct.
mr.
j.
edward
thornton
that’s
correct.
mr.
j.
edward
thornton
no,
i
would
not
say
that.
i
would
say
that
they
probably
could
acquire
a
license
for
a
local
office
there.
mr.
j.
edward
thornton
well,
maybe
they
can’t.
mr.
j.
edward
thornton
no,
my
last
point.
mr.
j.
edward
thornton
well
then,
if
it
does,
i
don’t
want
make
that
concession,
because
i
--
and
i
didn’t
understand
your
question
adequately
i’m
sorry,
this
i
don’t
know
--
mr.
j.
edward
thornton
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
edward
thornton
well,
admittedly
the
more
local
activities
we
engage
here,
the
more
the
state
has
to
latch
on
to.
mr.
j.
edward
thornton
but
we
think
in
this
case,
see
this
license
isn’t
at
penny,
if
they
go
at
penny,
that’s
a
different
proposition
as
to
penny’s
activities
with
reference
to
advertising,
our
coming
into
the
state
to.
but
here
where
our
coming
into
the
state
is
purely
transient,
we
come
in
and
out
merely
exposing
film.
we
say
now
then
that
the
isolating
this
part
of
it
and
attempting
to
tax
that
as
a
local
activity
is
actually
tax
on
the
entire
transaction.
we
say
that
is
attempt
by
the
state
to
license
an
interstate
activity,
which
they
can’t
do
and
so
the
$25
license
should
not
apply
if
i
am
keeping
myself
straight.
mr.
j.
edward
thornton
i
haven’t
thought
so.
mr.
j.
edward
thornton
i
hadn’t
thought
so.
mr.
j.
edward
thornton
yes.
mr.
j.
edward
thornton
that
is
correct.
mr.
j.
edward
thornton
well,
i’m
backing
off
on
that
completely.
first
we
can
strike
that
from
the
record
and
i
hope.
mr.
j.
edward
thornton
now
push
the
drummer
case.
this
is
the
drummer
case,
this
was
just
different.
the
drummer
case
is
the
states
have
sought
to
license
the
solicitation
of

in
so
far
--
mr.
j.
edward
thornton
as
a
client
in
this
case.
but,
that’s
the
only
discriminatory
feature
that
we
are
raising
is
the
discriminatory
because
of
the
application
in
this
case.
mr.
j.
edward
thornton
well,
it
discriminates
against
those
who
send
exposed
film
in
the
state,
out
of
the
state.
yes
sir.
but
that’s
the
only
part
and
but
the
objection
is
commerce
clause,
you
see
this
is
discriminatory
against
interstate
commerce
and
so
far
as
i
know
that
has
never
been
recognized.
mr.
j.
edward
thornton
well
no.
but
we
are
interested
in
the
commerce
clause.
this
is
point
under
which
we
developed
the
case
and
the
discriminatory
aspect
of
it
is
by
reason
--
mr.
j.
edward
thornton
well,
the
--
mr.
j.
edward
thornton
no.
i
would
not
read.
i
state
that
the
alabama
can
make
a
difference
between
itinerant
and
fixed
location
photography.
we
raise
no
point
on
that.
mr.
j.
edward
thornton
well,
this
--
mr.
j.
edward
thornton
well,
this
of
course
is
the
plot
we
want
most
of
all,
but
if
i
may
on
page
27
of
the
brief,
the
reason
they
held
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
held,
the
reason
they
held
that
we
were
subject
to
a
transient
or
itinerant
license,
was
because
it
says
this,
true
in
the
branch
operation,
this
had
to
do
with
olan
mills
case,
page
27,
there
is
a
fixed
location.
but
it
sends
its
film
back
to
chattanooga
to
be
processed
and
the
pictures
are
ultimately
made
in
chattanooga.
now
on
this
basis
you
see
it
was
because
of
this
interstate
activity
that
the
transient
or
the
$5
a
week
license
is
imposed
rather
than
the
$25
a
year
license.
now
we
say
this
is
a
direct
discrimination
against
interstate
activity.
now
as
to
the
equal
protection
clause,
as
to
the
state
making
a
difference
between
itinerant
photographers
and
resident
photographers,
we
may
make
no
point
on
that.
have
i
made
myself
reasonably
clear?
i
would
reserve
the
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
j.
edward
thornton
i
just
have
a
word.
i
think
the
facts
in
the
graves
case
may
be
of
some
importance.
olan
mills
at
that
time
was
engaged
in
a
two-stage
operation.
it
solicitors
who
went
through
the
state
soliciting
orders.
it
had
a
photographer
who
followed.
now
when
the
photographer
came
through,
they
arrested
him
for
not
having
a
transient
photographer’s
license.
question
number
one
was,
is
the
mere
exposure
of
film
engaging
in
the
business
of
photography,
and
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
held
it
was.
it
being
so
essential,
a
part
of
the
photography
business
that
a
license
owned
photography
generally
would
apply
to
the
mere
exposure
of
film.
now
it’s
that
holding
that
comes
over
into
these
cases
here,
where
they
say,
well
now
we
have
already
held
that
the
license
is
only
on,
now
that’s
not
quite
true,
it
was
true
in
the
graves
case,
because
that’s
all
graves
did.
but
they’ve
now
come
along
and
said,
but
that’s
all
you
have
to
do
in
order
to
be
subjected
to
the
license.
this
is
true,
but
it’s
true
in
a
sort
of
a
backhanded
fashion
but
nevertheless
it
does
show
that
the
license
is
on
the
mere
exposure
of
film
and
we’re
taking
the
position
that
when
that
is
connected
with
the
entire
transaction,
which
goes
across
the
state
line,
that
the
state
is
not
--
mr.
j.
edward
thornton
i
believe
that
would
be
the
correct
construction.
mr.
j.
edward
thornton
no,
on
the
$25
license
in
montgomery
on
the
$5
one?
mr.
j.
edward
thornton
that’s
this
case.
mr.
j.
edward
thornton
that
is
this
case.
but
here
you
see,
the
point
is
that
we
were
taking
pictures
at
a
fixed
location
at
penny’s.
mr.
j.
edward
thornton
well,
the
going
out
of
the
state
is
what
makes
the
photography
at
a
fixed
location
a
transient
operation.
mr.
j.
edward
thornton
if
it’s
already
a
transient
operation
i
don’t
believe
whether
he
develops
it
in
the
state
or
out
of
the
state
would
make
any
difference.
mr.
j.
edward
thornton
well,
no,
no.
the
reason
we
got
the
$5
a
week,
there
is
a
reason
we
became
a
transient.
i’m
repeating
myself
a
little
bit.
we
take
pictures
at
--
we
exposed
film
at
a
fixed
location.
now
that
should
be
$25
a
year
if
a
license
is
on
it,
of
course
we
would
contest
that
i
think
we
are
contesting
license
or
could
we
say
in
the
interstate
commerce.
but
if
the
license
at
a
fixed
location
with
charges,
it
would
be
$25
a
year.
but
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
we
send
it
outside
--
mr.
j.
edward
thornton
that’s
correct.
that’s
exactly
right
and
that’s
my
last
point.
we
guess
it’s
right
after
--
and
i
don’t
want
you
to
ever
get
that,
i
hope
you
never
get
to
that
point,
because
you
see
they
can
cure
that
so
easily,
then
we’ll
be
back
in
court,
we
want
to
the
first
one.
mr.
j.
edward
thornton
what.
mr.
j.
edward
thornton
what’s
that?
mr.
j.
edward
thornton
well,
they
would
just
demand
the
license
and
say
that
regardless
of
where
the
film
is
developed,
the
license
would
be
$5
a
week.
mr.
j.
edward
thornton
for
transient
photographers.
mr.
j.
edward
thornton
well
the
reason
they
proved
we
were
a
transient
here
was
because
we
sent
it
out.
mr.
j.
edward
thornton
well,
my
part
is
that
they
might
cure
that
by
eliminating
the
discriminatory
nature
of
the
tax,
because
of
the
interstate
activity.
this
they
could
cure.
mr.
j.
edward
thornton
oh
yes,
oh
yes.
mr.
j.
edward
thornton
that’s
correct.
mr.
j.
edward
thornton
that’s
correct.
mr.
j.
edward
thornton
no,
i
would
not
say
that.
i
would
say
that
they
probably
could
acquire
a
license
for
a
local
office
there.
mr.
j.
edward
thornton
well,
maybe
they
can’t.
mr.
j.
edward
thornton
no,
my
last
point.
mr.
j.
edward
thornton
well
then,
if
it
does,
i
don’t
want
make
that
concession,
because
i
--
and
i
didn’t
understand
your
question
adequately
i’m
sorry,
this
i
don’t
know
--
mr.
j.
edward
thornton
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
edward
thornton
well,
admittedly
the
more
local
activities
we
engage
here,
the
more
the
state
has
to
latch
on
to.
mr.
j.
edward
thornton
but
we
think
in
this
case,
see
this
license
isn’t
at
penny,
if
they
go
at
penny,
that’s
a
different
proposition
as
to
penny’s
activities
with
reference
to
advertising,
our
coming
into
the
state
to.
but
here
where
our
coming
into
the
state
is
purely
transient,
we
come
in
and
out
merely
exposing
film.
we
say
now
then
that
the
isolating
this
part
of
it
and
attempting
to
tax
that
as
a
local
activity
is
actually
tax
on
the
entire
transaction.
we
say
that
is
attempt
by
the
state
to
license
an
interstate
activity,
which
they
can’t
do
and
so
the
$25
license
should
not
apply
if
i
am
keeping
myself
straight.
mr.
j.
edward
thornton
i
haven’t
thought
so.
mr.
j.
edward
thornton
i
hadn’t
thought
so.
mr.
j.
edward
thornton
yes.
mr.
j.
edward
thornton
that
is
correct.
mr.
j.
edward
thornton
well,
i’m
backing
off
on
that
completely.
first
we
can
strike
that
from
the
record
and
i
hope.
