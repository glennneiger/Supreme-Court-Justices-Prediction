it
seems
to
me
that
the
complicating
factor
here
is
that
this

as
a
j.c.
penny
operation.

penny
rounds
up
the

does
the

and
delivers
the
photographs
after
their

as
i
recall
the
facts
here.

fortas
and
that
--
and
in
that
sense
it
is
different
from
the
typical

case.
justice

fortas
and
then
you
have
these
out
of
state
photographers
who
come
in
and
expose
film
and
send
the
film
out
of
state
to
be
developed.
and
they
the
film,
then
the
photographs
are
sent
back
to
j.c.
penny,
so
you
have
them.
situation
here
that
is
a
little
complicated
in
the
intermingling
of
intra
and
interstate
aspects
a
little
more
than
mingling
than
some
of
the
others
on
that
book.
justice
abe
fortas

the
tax
is
not
imposed
on
j.c.

the

inevitably
and
inescapably
involve
j.c.

you’re

somewhat.
justice

mr.
mr.

there
is
a
little
more
to
the
facts
of
this
case
and
just
the
mere
exposure
of
films
isn’t
there?
don’t
we
have
in
this
case
that
penny
gives
extensive
advertising
to
the
fact
that
these
people
will
be
there
at
a
certain
time
and
will
have
a
fixed
location
in
the
city
to
transact
its
business
and
it
does
transact
business
in
this
particular
place.
justice
abe
fortas
well
doesn’t
that
bear
somewhat
on
whether
it’s
a
local
thing
that
is
being
taxed
or
not
or
whether
it
could
be
taxed
as
a
local
activity?

yes.
