mr.
william
h.
burton
gentlemen,
in
biased
instanced
here,
it
seems
that
the
appellant
rather
accuses
the
state
of
alabama
and
the
city
of
mobile
of
entering
into
some
kind
of
evil
conspiracy
to
put
this
company
out
of
business.
but
actually
the
tax
levied
by
the
state
has
nothing
whatsoever
to
do
with
the
tax
levied
by
the
city,
they
are
two
separate
and
distinct
entities
and
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
there
was
any
kind
of
collusion
or
conspiracy
here
between
the
state
and
the
city.
now
as
any
if
there,
where
there
is
a
confusion
it
is
in
this
field
of
interstate
commerce.
and
as
i
read
the
cases,
if
there
is
one
universal
principle
that
applies
to
all
cases
it
is
that
each
case
stands
on
its
own
shoes,
on
its
own
facts.
now
this
particular
case,
not
in
this
case
but
in
similar
cases
where
the
state
has
assessed
this
licensed
action,
against
photographers
operating
for
olan
mills,
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
on
not
one,
but
on
three
occasions
has
held
that
this
tax
is
directed
at
the
photographer
and
the
individual
photographer.
that
is
a
person
who
comes
in
and
takes
the
picture.
now
we
disagree
with
counsel
for
the
appellant
that
the
court
has
said
that
it’s
now
sending
the
films
out
of
the
state.
if
that
were
true,
i
wouldn’t
be
here
arguing
the
case.
but
what
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
has
held
in
defining
the
characteristics
of
this
tax.
and
its
authoritative
meaning
is
that
it’s
directed
at
the
individual
photographer
and
on
his
activities
in
the
state
more
or
less
conducting
the
setting
and
taking
the
picture.
and
if
you
read
the
license,
it
says,
actually
this
license
is
levied
under
title
51
that’s
the
revenue
code
of
the
state,
section
569.
now
the
first
part
of
the
statute
relates
to
fixed
locations
or
photography
gallery.
then
there
is
a
last
sentence
there
which
levies
a
separate
and
distinct
license
on
transit
or
travelling
photographers.
and
actually
it
reads
as
follows,
for
each
transit
or
travelling
photographer
$5
a
week.
now
in
the
case
of
graves
versus
alabama,
that
was
the
case
involving
one
of
olan
mills
photographs
and
it
was
a
criminal
case
in
the
circuit
court
and
in
that
case
when
it
got
to
the
supreme
court
of
alabama,
the
court
held
that
the
license
was
directed
at
the
photographer
as
the
statute
says
each
travelling
or
transit
photographer
$5
a
week.
mr.
william
h.
burton
your
honor.
mr.
william
h.
burton
it’s
clearly
a
license
task,
it’s
a
task.
and
it’s
not
claiming
the
strictly
speaking
a
license,
it
doesn’t
give
anybody
the
right
to
do
anything,
if
you
do
this
business.
mr.
william
h.
burton
right,
right
that’s
right.
mr.
william
h.
burton
it’s
for
the
privilege
of
doing
this
business
in
the
state
of
alabama
and
districts.
mr.
william
h.
burton
this
business
is,
business
as
a
transit
or
travelling
photographer.
mr.
william
h.
burton
well
our
court
has
to
find
that
in
this
graves
case.
graves
versus
alabama.
mr.
william
h.
burton
as
being
a
photographer,
who
goes
out
of
state
from
county
to
county
where
he
has
no
fixed
location.
mr.
william
h.
burton
and
takes
pictures
and
conduct
settings.
mr.
william
h.
burton
yes
and
--
mr.
william
h.
burton
no
sir,
what
our
court
has
said
that
this
license
is
directed
at
is
the
photographer
taking
the
picture
conducting
a
setting.
and
gentlemen
that
requires
a
place
in
which
skill
is
an
odd
in
itself
and
i
have
always
looked
on
a
photographer
as
somebody
who
takes
a
picture.
the
proof
readers
and
the
film
developers
in
north
carolina
or
tennessee
that’s
not
what
this
license
is,
if
it’s
the
photographer,
the
individual
photographer
and
this
assessment
was
made
against
olan
mills
company.
mr.
william
h.
burton
no
sir,
we
say
that
there
is
a
quite
a
distinction
between
the
two,
we
say
that
the
license
on
a
fixed
location,
on
a
photograph
gallery
is
another
place
and
that
this
license
--
mr.
william
h.
burton
sets
up
or
not.
mr.
william
h.
burton
yes,
sir
that
is
true.
mr.
william
h.
burton
i
would
say
no
sir,
not
in
the
operation
of
the
camera
and
taking
the
picture,
i
would
say
it
would
all
be
the
same
recognize
–
mr.
william
h.
burton
well,
that
depends
whether
the
itinerant
or
the
transit
has
charged
more.
if
he
stays
one
week
it’s
only
a
$5
but
if
a
person
--
mr.
william
h.
burton
well,
we
say
they
are
in
different
classes
or
sub-classes
and
that
the
state.
mr.
william
h.
burton
i
believe
your
honor
in
this
graves
case,
they
touched
on
it,
i
don’t
know
how
deeply,
i
don’t
recall
that
part
of
the
case
but
i
believe
that
they
did
touch
on
that
and
in
the
graves
case
they
did
point
out
that
this
transit
photographer
license,
it
applies
to
those
who
come
from
without
and
from
within
the
state
alike.
in
other
words,
if
a
photographer
has
a
fixed
location
in
montgomery
and
it’s
been
so
applied.
and
he
sends
photographers
out
in
monroe
county
and
mobile
county,
jefferson
or
some
other
county
in
alabama.
then
his
photographers
where
they
don’t
have
a
fixed
place
--
if
they
pay
this
license
are
supposed
to
stay
--
mr.
william
h.
burton
in
that
case
your
honor,
the
license
would
be
on
the
photograph
gallery
and
it
would
only
the
one
license
that’s
true.
mr.
william
h.
burton
your
honor
the
--
our
reasoning
there
is
that
they
have
two
separate
and
distinct
licenses.
in
out
of
--
mr.
william
h.
burton
well,
we
say
that
the
photographer
who
has
a
fixed
place
of
business
in
a
different
place
from
the
travelling
photographer
that
goes
from
county
to
county.
that’s
a
different,
you
might
say
operation
and
it’s
a
different
class
or
subclass
but
this
court
has
said
that
the
congress
and
the
state
legislatures
can
for
the
purpose
of
taxation,
they
can
set
up
classes
and
even
subclasses.
mr.
william
h.
burton
your
honor,
i
would
like
to
say
this
along
that
line
in
explanation
is
that
in
the
case
that
the
fixed
location.
if
you
have
five
places
of
business
in
one
city,
you
would
have
to
have
five
different
licenses
under
the
general
provisions
of
the
revenue
code
relating
the
licenses
and
more
particular
title
51,
section
831a.
if
you
got
ten
places
of
business,
fixed
location
places
of
business
then
you
would
take
ten
licenses.
actually
the
traveling
photographer
can
take
for
week
on
$5
could
operate
through
out
every
city
in
the
county
whereas
the
photographer
with
the
fixed
location
would
have
to
pay
a
license
fee
for
separate
place
of
business.
mr.
william
h.
burton
your
honor
in
that
case,
if
they
have
no
fixed
place
of
business,
i
think
you
would
charge
them
both
this
$5
license
just
saying
whether
they
develop
the
film
in
the
county
or
well
they
send
it
out
you
would
charged
him
the
same
licenses
of
$5
a
week.
mr.
william
h.
burton
your
honor,
you
can
prosecute,
penalize
a
person
but
not
paying
any
tax,
whether
it’s
in
oklahoma,
alabama
anywhere
else
everyone
one
of
these
taxes
--
mr.
william
h.
burton
your
honor
we
say
that
we
are
not
because
of
the
fact
that
this
tax
is
not
an
entrance
fee.
in
other
words
--
an
entrance
fee.
it’s
not
a
license
--.
mr.
william
h.
burton
your
honor,
they
are
supposed
to
pay
the
tax.
but
it
wouldn’t
keep
them
out
of
the
state.
mr.
william
h.
burton
yes,
but
that
would
be
not
for
paying
the
tax,
it
wouldn’t
be
a
mean.
mr.
william
h.
burton
but
the
same
person
located
within
the
state
would
also
be
--.
mr.
william
h.
burton
yes.
mr.
william
h.
burton
i
have
agree
--
whole
heartedly
mr.
william
h.
burton
yes
and
that’s
what
i’m
trying
to
find
out.
mr.
william
h.
burton
yes.
mr.
william
h.
burton
your
honor,
it
had
been
held
by
this
court
and
i
would
think
you’ve
written
some
of
the
opinions
that
i
read,
that
where
you
can
realistically
separate
activities
and
localize
them
that
you
can
validly
tax
them
and
--
mr.
william
h.
burton
and
that’s
exactly
our
contention
in
this
case
that
and
another
point
right
there
--
this
court
in
united
gas
pipeline
versus
city
of
mobile
held
that
it
was
a
prerogative,
i
won’t
say
prerogative
but
the
right
of
the
state
courts
to
define
the
meaning
of
a
tax
and
tell
what
the
characteristics
of
a
tax
are
and
in
that
case
this
court
sent
that
case
back
to
alabama
for
the
state
court
to
define
the
meaning
of
the
tax.
now
mr.
justice
douglas,
has
said
that
the
case
had
been
back,
he
said
that
the
license
tax
in
that
case
was
valid
at
the
time
it
didn’t
need
to
back.
mr.
justice
harlan,
in
that
case
he
says
that
it
didn’t
make
any
difference
whether
it
was
an
entrance
fee
or
not,
he
didn’t
think
that
resolved
the
constitutional
question
involved
but
this
court.
mr.
william
h.
burton
well,
the
majority
sent
it
back.
the
majority
of
the
court
sent
that
case
back
to
alabama.
mr.
william
h.
burton
sir?
mr.
william
h.
burton
your
honor,
i
have
the
--
that’s
united
gas
pipeline
versus
ideal
cement
company,
369
us
134.
now
there
is
also
a
case
by
the
supreme
court
of
alabama,
when
the
case
was
sent
back,
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
actually
defined
the
characteristics
of
the
tax
and
it
held
that
that
tax
was
a
local
tax,
although
united
gas
pipeline
company
was
engaged
in
transporting
gas
in
interstate
commerce,
that
was
their
business
and
selling
it.
but
they
held
that
this
license
levied
by
the
city
of
mobile
on
the
selling
of
natural
gas
in
mobile
was
a
local
license.
and
you
could
realistically
separate
that
activity
from
united’s
interstate
activities,
that’s
exactly
our
argument
in
this
case.
also
another
case
that
we
rely
strongly
on
is
the
caskey
baking
case,
whereby
license
was
levied
on
bakeries,
i
believe
those
selling
bread
to
people,
retailers,
licensed
retailers
in
the
state
of
virginia.
and
the
bread
was
baked
in
west
virginia
and
transported
over
the
state
land.
it’s
more
or
less
one
of
the
peddler
cases
but
this
court
held
that
license
tax
directed
at
that
local
activity
of
selling
the
bread
and
delivering
it
half
of
their
trucks
was
sufficient
while
the
license
tax
validly
attached.
another
point
in
the
graves
decision,
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
has
held
that
inherently
this
tax
does
not
discriminate
because
it
applies
equally
to
all
transit
photographers,
whether
they
come
within
or
without
the
state.
and
clearly
this
type
of
operation
for
the
appellant
relies
mainly
on
the
drummer
cases
and
i
suppose
the
leading
case
in
that
line
is
nippert
versus
richmond
but
there
the
license
was
levied
on
solicitations
and
the
orders
was
sent
to
washington
i
believe
the
nippert
represented
a
washington
garment
manufacturing
company
and
the
court
held
that
the
solicitations
were
clearly
in
interstate
commerce
and
that
license
could
not
be
valid
or
levied
in
that
case.
mr.
william
h.
burton
well,
that
case
--
mr.
william
h.
burton
your
honor,
i
want
to
point
out
one
thing
in
that
case
it
was
brought
out
that
before
you
could
secure
the
license
in
that
case
that
you
had
to
get
a
permit
from
the
department
of
public
safety,
now
that’s
not
so
in
this
case.
and
along
the
line
of
your
question
that,
where
that
was
more
or
less
an
entrance
fee,
this
license
if
you
go
out
to
the
probate
judges’
office
and
you
put
the
money
down
you
can
get
everybody
is
entitled
to
buy
this
license,
i
don’t
care
whether
you
end
the
business
or
not,
this
is
a
no
respect
an
entrance
fee
or
really
a
permit
or
a
license.
in
fact
the
probate
judge
will
welcome
you
with
open
arms,
if
you
come
up
with
the
money
and
he
will
issue
you
the
license.
mr.
william
h.
burton
sir?
mr.
william
h.
burton
it’s
a
license
tax,
your
honor,
i
have
used
that
word
and
i
had
used
rather
loosely
but
this
is
a
license,
it’s
a
tax
and
is
on,
and
the
alabama
court
has
held
that
it’s
only
doing
a
business,
it’s
not
a
right
to
do
business.
if
you
don’t
apply
this
license
in
other
words
you
can
come
in
to
the
state
of
alabama
and
you
can
do
business
and
your
contracts
are
valid.
it
doesn’t
keep
you
out
of
the
state
--
mr.
william
h.
burton
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
william
h.
burton
that’s
what
it
left
it
yes.
but
i
say
this,
we
have
provisions
in
our
sales
tax
and
use
that
and
income
taxes
that
have
the
same
provisions
and
oklahoma
does,
and
colorado,
any
other
states
and
the
federal
tax
laws,
i
mean
if
you
don’t
pay
any
tax.
mr.
william
h.
burton
the
statute
does
say
that
your
honor,
that
is
very
true.
i
mean
its,
no
disputing
that,
that’s
been
black
and
white
but
as
a
matter
of
applications
actually
these
business
--
mr.
william
h.
burton
well
i
tell
you,
it’s
not
the
duty
of
the
state
or
the
federal
government
to
catch
any
tax
pleas--
mr.
william
h.
burton
well
i
would
think
that,
that
would
be
pretty
bad.
mr.
william
h.
burton
well
your
honor
i
don’t
what
the
license
it
was.
mr.
william
h.
burton
yes.
i
don’t
know
what
license,
i
don’t
believe
that
came
within
the
scope
of
these
business
licenses.
these
are
purely
business
or
occupational
taxes.
mr.
william
h.
burton
it
could
be,
i’m
not
familiar
with
the
case
your
honor.
mr.
william
h.
burton
yes.
but
actually
this
wouldn’t
cause
you
to
--
your
contracts
to
be
void
or
anything.
you
could
do
business
in
the
state,
but
--
and
i
will
say
that
as
a
matter
of
application,
the
criminal
provisions
are
not
used
very
often
by
the
department
of
revenue.
mr.
william
h.
burton
sir?
mr.
william
h.
burton
no
sir.
leon
graves
versus
state
of
alabama
was
a
criminal
case.
and
leon
graves
was
a
agent
or
photographer
for
olan
mills.
mr.
william
h.
burton
yes.
well
that’s
true
that
in
the
leon
graves
case
they
did
invoke
these
penal
statutes,
yes
they
did.
but
in
present
time
they
very
seldom
bring
a
--
and
it’s
really
frowned
on.
they
try
to
bring
several
actions
to
recover
these
licenses.
thank
you
gentlemen.
mr.
william
h.
burton
gentlemen,
in
biased
instanced
here,
it
seems
that
the
appellant
rather
accuses
the
state
of
alabama
and
the
city
of
mobile
of
entering
into
some
kind
of
evil
conspiracy
to
put
this
company
out
of
business.
but
actually
the
tax
levied
by
the
state
has
nothing
whatsoever
to
do
with
the
tax
levied
by
the
city,
they
are
two
separate
and
distinct
entities
and
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
there
was
any
kind
of
collusion
or
conspiracy
here
between
the
state
and
the
city.
now
as
any
if
there,
where
there
is
a
confusion
it
is
in
this
field
of
interstate
commerce.
and
as
i
read
the
cases,
if
there
is
one
universal
principle
that
applies
to
all
cases
it
is
that
each
case
stands
on
its
own
shoes,
on
its
own
facts.
now
this
particular
case,
not
in
this
case
but
in
similar
cases
where
the
state
has
assessed
this
licensed
action,
against
photographers
operating
for
olan
mills,
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
on
not
one,
but
on
three
occasions
has
held
that
this
tax
is
directed
at
the
photographer
and
the
individual
photographer.
that
is
a
person
who
comes
in
and
takes
the
picture.
now
we
disagree
with
counsel
for
the
appellant
that
the
court
has
said
that
it’s
now
sending
the
films
out
of
the
state.
if
that
were
true,
i
wouldn’t
be
here
arguing
the
case.
but
what
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
has
held
in
defining
the
characteristics
of
this
tax.
and
its
authoritative
meaning
is
that
it’s
directed
at
the
individual
photographer
and
on
his
activities
in
the
state
more
or
less
conducting
the
setting
and
taking
the
picture.
and
if
you
read
the
license,
it
says,
actually
this
license
is
levied
under
title
51
that’s
the
revenue
code
of
the
state,
section
569.
now
the
first
part
of
the
statute
relates
to
fixed
locations
or
photography
gallery.
then
there
is
a
last
sentence
there
which
levies
a
separate
and
distinct
license
on
transit
or
travelling
photographers.
and
actually
it
reads
as
follows,
for
each
transit
or
travelling
photographer
$5
a
week.
now
in
the
case
of
graves
versus
alabama,
that
was
the
case
involving
one
of
olan
mills
photographs
and
it
was
a
criminal
case
in
the
circuit
court
and
in
that
case
when
it
got
to
the
supreme
court
of
alabama,
the
court
held
that
the
license
was
directed
at
the
photographer
as
the
statute
says
each
travelling
or
transit
photographer
$5
a
week.
mr.
william
h.
burton
your
honor.
mr.
william
h.
burton
it’s
clearly
a
license
task,
it’s
a
task.
and
it’s
not
claiming
the
strictly
speaking
a
license,
it
doesn’t
give
anybody
the
right
to
do
anything,
if
you
do
this
business.
mr.
william
h.
burton
right,
right
that’s
right.
mr.
william
h.
burton
it’s
for
the
privilege
of
doing
this
business
in
the
state
of
alabama
and
districts.
mr.
william
h.
burton
this
business
is,
business
as
a
transit
or
travelling
photographer.
mr.
william
h.
burton
well
our
court
has
to
find
that
in
this
graves
case.
graves
versus
alabama.
mr.
william
h.
burton
as
being
a
photographer,
who
goes
out
of
state
from
county
to
county
where
he
has
no
fixed
location.
mr.
william
h.
burton
and
takes
pictures
and
conduct
settings.
mr.
william
h.
burton
yes
and
--
mr.
william
h.
burton
no
sir,
what
our
court
has
said
that
this
license
is
directed
at
is
the
photographer
taking
the
picture
conducting
a
setting.
and
gentlemen
that
requires
a
place
in
which
skill
is
an
odd
in
itself
and
i
have
always
looked
on
a
photographer
as
somebody
who
takes
a
picture.
the
proof
readers
and
the
film
developers
in
north
carolina
or
tennessee
that’s
not
what
this
license
is,
if
it’s
the
photographer,
the
individual
photographer
and
this
assessment
was
made
against
olan
mills
company.
mr.
william
h.
burton
no
sir,
we
say
that
there
is
a
quite
a
distinction
between
the
two,
we
say
that
the
license
on
a
fixed
location,
on
a
photograph
gallery
is
another
place
and
that
this
license
--
mr.
william
h.
burton
sets
up
or
not.
mr.
william
h.
burton
yes,
sir
that
is
true.
mr.
william
h.
burton
i
would
say
no
sir,
not
in
the
operation
of
the
camera
and
taking
the
picture,
i
would
say
it
would
all
be
the
same
recognize
–
mr.
william
h.
burton
well,
that
depends
whether
the
itinerant
or
the
transit
has
charged
more.
if
he
stays
one
week
it’s
only
a
$5
but
if
a
person
--
mr.
william
h.
burton
well,
we
say
they
are
in
different
classes
or
sub-classes
and
that
the
state.
mr.
william
h.
burton
i
believe
your
honor
in
this
graves
case,
they
touched
on
it,
i
don’t
know
how
deeply,
i
don’t
recall
that
part
of
the
case
but
i
believe
that
they
did
touch
on
that
and
in
the
graves
case
they
did
point
out
that
this
transit
photographer
license,
it
applies
to
those
who
come
from
without
and
from
within
the
state
alike.
in
other
words,
if
a
photographer
has
a
fixed
location
in
montgomery
and
it’s
been
so
applied.
and
he
sends
photographers
out
in
monroe
county
and
mobile
county,
jefferson
or
some
other
county
in
alabama.
then
his
photographers
where
they
don’t
have
a
fixed
place
--
if
they
pay
this
license
are
supposed
to
stay
--
mr.
william
h.
burton
in
that
case
your
honor,
the
license
would
be
on
the
photograph
gallery
and
it
would
only
the
one
license
that’s
true.
mr.
william
h.
burton
your
honor
the
--
our
reasoning
there
is
that
they
have
two
separate
and
distinct
licenses.
in
out
of
--
mr.
william
h.
burton
well,
we
say
that
the
photographer
who
has
a
fixed
place
of
business
in
a
different
place
from
the
travelling
photographer
that
goes
from
county
to
county.
that’s
a
different,
you
might
say
operation
and
it’s
a
different
class
or
subclass
but
this
court
has
said
that
the
congress
and
the
state
legislatures
can
for
the
purpose
of
taxation,
they
can
set
up
classes
and
even
subclasses.
mr.
william
h.
burton
your
honor,
i
would
like
to
say
this
along
that
line
in
explanation
is
that
in
the
case
that
the
fixed
location.
if
you
have
five
places
of
business
in
one
city,
you
would
have
to
have
five
different
licenses
under
the
general
provisions
of
the
revenue
code
relating
the
licenses
and
more
particular
title
51,
section
831a.
if
you
got
ten
places
of
business,
fixed
location
places
of
business
then
you
would
take
ten
licenses.
actually
the
traveling
photographer
can
take
for
week
on
$5
could
operate
through
out
every
city
in
the
county
whereas
the
photographer
with
the
fixed
location
would
have
to
pay
a
license
fee
for
separate
place
of
business.
mr.
william
h.
burton
your
honor
in
that
case,
if
they
have
no
fixed
place
of
business,
i
think
you
would
charge
them
both
this
$5
license
just
saying
whether
they
develop
the
film
in
the
county
or
well
they
send
it
out
you
would
charged
him
the
same
licenses
of
$5
a
week.
mr.
william
h.
burton
your
honor,
you
can
prosecute,
penalize
a
person
but
not
paying
any
tax,
whether
it’s
in
oklahoma,
alabama
anywhere
else
everyone
one
of
these
taxes
--
mr.
william
h.
burton
your
honor
we
say
that
we
are
not
because
of
the
fact
that
this
tax
is
not
an
entrance
fee.
in
other
words
--
an
entrance
fee.
it’s
not
a
license
--.
mr.
william
h.
burton
your
honor,
they
are
supposed
to
pay
the
tax.
but
it
wouldn’t
keep
them
out
of
the
state.
mr.
william
h.
burton
yes,
but
that
would
be
not
for
paying
the
tax,
it
wouldn’t
be
a
mean.
mr.
william
h.
burton
but
the
same
person
located
within
the
state
would
also
be
--.
mr.
william
h.
burton
yes.
mr.
william
h.
burton
i
have
agree
--
whole
heartedly
mr.
william
h.
burton
yes
and
that’s
what
i’m
trying
to
find
out.
mr.
william
h.
burton
yes.
mr.
william
h.
burton
your
honor,
it
had
been
held
by
this
court
and
i
would
think
you’ve
written
some
of
the
opinions
that
i
read,
that
where
you
can
realistically
separate
activities
and
localize
them
that
you
can
validly
tax
them
and
--
mr.
william
h.
burton
and
that’s
exactly
our
contention
in
this
case
that
and
another
point
right
there
--
this
court
in
united
gas
pipeline
versus
city
of
mobile
held
that
it
was
a
prerogative,
i
won’t
say
prerogative
but
the
right
of
the
state
courts
to
define
the
meaning
of
a
tax
and
tell
what
the
characteristics
of
a
tax
are
and
in
that
case
this
court
sent
that
case
back
to
alabama
for
the
state
court
to
define
the
meaning
of
the
tax.
now
mr.
justice
douglas,
has
said
that
the
case
had
been
back,
he
said
that
the
license
tax
in
that
case
was
valid
at
the
time
it
didn’t
need
to
back.
mr.
justice
harlan,
in
that
case
he
says
that
it
didn’t
make
any
difference
whether
it
was
an
entrance
fee
or
not,
he
didn’t
think
that
resolved
the
constitutional
question
involved
but
this
court.
mr.
william
h.
burton
well,
the
majority
sent
it
back.
the
majority
of
the
court
sent
that
case
back
to
alabama.
mr.
william
h.
burton
sir?
mr.
william
h.
burton
your
honor,
i
have
the
--
that’s
united
gas
pipeline
versus
ideal
cement
company,
369
us
134.
now
there
is
also
a
case
by
the
supreme
court
of
alabama,
when
the
case
was
sent
back,
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
actually
defined
the
characteristics
of
the
tax
and
it
held
that
that
tax
was
a
local
tax,
although
united
gas
pipeline
company
was
engaged
in
transporting
gas
in
interstate
commerce,
that
was
their
business
and
selling
it.
but
they
held
that
this
license
levied
by
the
city
of
mobile
on
the
selling
of
natural
gas
in
mobile
was
a
local
license.
and
you
could
realistically
separate
that
activity
from
united’s
interstate
activities,
that’s
exactly
our
argument
in
this
case.
also
another
case
that
we
rely
strongly
on
is
the
caskey
baking
case,
whereby
license
was
levied
on
bakeries,
i
believe
those
selling
bread
to
people,
retailers,
licensed
retailers
in
the
state
of
virginia.
and
the
bread
was
baked
in
west
virginia
and
transported
over
the
state
land.
it’s
more
or
less
one
of
the
peddler
cases
but
this
court
held
that
license
tax
directed
at
that
local
activity
of
selling
the
bread
and
delivering
it
half
of
their
trucks
was
sufficient
while
the
license
tax
validly
attached.
another
point
in
the
graves
decision,
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
has
held
that
inherently
this
tax
does
not
discriminate
because
it
applies
equally
to
all
transit
photographers,
whether
they
come
within
or
without
the
state.
and
clearly
this
type
of
operation
for
the
appellant
relies
mainly
on
the
drummer
cases
and
i
suppose
the
leading
case
in
that
line
is
nippert
versus
richmond
but
there
the
license
was
levied
on
solicitations
and
the
orders
was
sent
to
washington
i
believe
the
nippert
represented
a
washington
garment
manufacturing
company
and
the
court
held
that
the
solicitations
were
clearly
in
interstate
commerce
and
that
license
could
not
be
valid
or
levied
in
that
case.
mr.
william
h.
burton
well,
that
case
--
mr.
william
h.
burton
your
honor,
i
want
to
point
out
one
thing
in
that
case
it
was
brought
out
that
before
you
could
secure
the
license
in
that
case
that
you
had
to
get
a
permit
from
the
department
of
public
safety,
now
that’s
not
so
in
this
case.
and
along
the
line
of
your
question
that,
where
that
was
more
or
less
an
entrance
fee,
this
license
if
you
go
out
to
the
probate
judges’
office
and
you
put
the
money
down
you
can
get
everybody
is
entitled
to
buy
this
license,
i
don’t
care
whether
you
end
the
business
or
not,
this
is
a
no
respect
an
entrance
fee
or
really
a
permit
or
a
license.
in
fact
the
probate
judge
will
welcome
you
with
open
arms,
if
you
come
up
with
the
money
and
he
will
issue
you
the
license.
mr.
william
h.
burton
sir?
mr.
william
h.
burton
it’s
a
license
tax,
your
honor,
i
have
used
that
word
and
i
had
used
rather
loosely
but
this
is
a
license,
it’s
a
tax
and
is
on,
and
the
alabama
court
has
held
that
it’s
only
doing
a
business,
it’s
not
a
right
to
do
business.
if
you
don’t
apply
this
license
in
other
words
you
can
come
in
to
the
state
of
alabama
and
you
can
do
business
and
your
contracts
are
valid.
it
doesn’t
keep
you
out
of
the
state
--
mr.
william
h.
burton
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
william
h.
burton
that’s
what
it
left
it
yes.
but
i
say
this,
we
have
provisions
in
our
sales
tax
and
use
that
and
income
taxes
that
have
the
same
provisions
and
oklahoma
does,
and
colorado,
any
other
states
and
the
federal
tax
laws,
i
mean
if
you
don’t
pay
any
tax.
mr.
william
h.
burton
the
statute
does
say
that
your
honor,
that
is
very
true.
i
mean
its,
no
disputing
that,
that’s
been
black
and
white
but
as
a
matter
of
applications
actually
these
business
--
mr.
william
h.
burton
well
i
tell
you,
it’s
not
the
duty
of
the
state
or
the
federal
government
to
catch
any
tax
pleas--
mr.
william
h.
burton
well
i
would
think
that,
that
would
be
pretty
bad.
mr.
william
h.
burton
well
your
honor
i
don’t
what
the
license
it
was.
mr.
william
h.
burton
yes.
i
don’t
know
what
license,
i
don’t
believe
that
came
within
the
scope
of
these
business
licenses.
these
are
purely
business
or
occupational
taxes.
mr.
william
h.
burton
it
could
be,
i’m
not
familiar
with
the
case
your
honor.
mr.
william
h.
burton
yes.
but
actually
this
wouldn’t
cause
you
to
--
your
contracts
to
be
void
or
anything.
you
could
do
business
in
the
state,
but
--
and
i
will
say
that
as
a
matter
of
application,
the
criminal
provisions
are
not
used
very
often
by
the
department
of
revenue.
mr.
william
h.
burton
sir?
mr.
william
h.
burton
no
sir.
leon
graves
versus
state
of
alabama
was
a
criminal
case.
and
leon
graves
was
a
agent
or
photographer
for
olan
mills.
mr.
william
h.
burton
yes.
well
that’s
true
that
in
the
leon
graves
case
they
did
invoke
these
penal
statutes,
yes
they
did.
but
in
present
time
they
very
seldom
bring
a
--
and
it’s
really
frowned
on.
they
try
to
bring
several
actions
to
recover
these
licenses.
thank
you
gentlemen.
