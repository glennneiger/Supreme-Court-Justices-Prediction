justice

suppose
in
their
state
taxation
system
of
photographers,
suppose
there
is
a
large
photographers
business
and
he
has
half
a
dozen
people
in
there
who
take
the
pictures,
do
you
charge
him
one,
charge
them
one
or
half
a
dozen
licenses.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
you
told
us
a
little
while
ago
that
this
was
a
personal
that
it
was
directed
against
the
person
who
takes
some
pictures
and
if
that
is
true
why
wouldn’t
you
charge
him
six
license
fees
instead
of
one
if
he
had
six
people
taking
pictures.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
are
the
two
separate
and
distinct
licenses?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
the
state’s
interest
in
separating
these
two
that
you
just
mentioned
for
purposes
of
taxation.
there
must
be
some
reason
for
the
classification,
mustn’t
there
be?
justice
hugo
l.
black
let’s
see
if
it’s
in
the
last
sentence
here.
suppose
the
photographer
had
just
been
into
six
counties,
takes
pictures
in
six
counties.
he
develops
the
pictures
in
those
six
counties,
i
suppose
there
is
another
photographer
who
takes
the
pictures
in
six
different
counties
but
he
does
not
develop
them
in
any
of
those
counties
but
sends
them
all
to
be
finished.
could
you
charge
him
a
license
fee,
this
last
one
which
would
buy
him
from
doing
that
business,
if
he
didn’t
pay
the
license
for
the
whole
thing?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
i
gathered
for
this
case
up-to-date
may
be
its
wrong,
that
in
the
main
what
they
are
complaining
about
is
this.
they
send
a
representative
to
finish,
he
takes
pictures
with
the
understanding
of
those
will
be
sent
out
of
the
state,
develop
and
brought
back
and
they
complain
that
on
that
business
you
are
charging
them
a
license
which
would
forbid
them
to
do
business
without
it
and
you
could
prosecute
them,
couldn’t
you
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
taxing,
if
it
can
be
shown
that
what
your
tax
is,
is
the
tax
directly
on
the
other
interstate
commerce
which
says
you
got
to
pay
this
much
tax
to
do
business
in
the
state
and
interstate
commerce.
how
you
are
you
doing
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
separate
people
who
had
in
two
states
in
interstate
commerce
if
they
don’t
pay
it,
isn’t
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
wouldn’t
keep
them
out,
will
they
prosecuted
for
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
would
be
not
for
paying
a
tax
on
doing
business
in
the
interstate
commerce,
that’s
what
i
understand
is
that
your
argument?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
that’s
a
different
question.
justice
hugo
l.
black
can
you
tax
interstate
comers
at
all,
if
you
put
a
tax
on
it,
if
they
had
engaged
on
interstate
commerce.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
i
can’t
quite
understand
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
wouldn’t
be
doing
business
in
interstate
state
commerce,
they
went
to
(inaudible).
justice
hugo
l.
black
took
the
picture,
and
then
sent
it
all
to
be
developed
and
then
sent
back.
why
wouldn’t
that
all
be
a
part
of
the
interstate
commerce
transaction.
how
can
you
divide
it,
apply
to
the
argument
in
the
segment
and
force
them
to
pay
the
license
to
do
that
business.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that’s
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
which
one
had
the
most
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
mr.
burton,
what
is
that
case
--
if
you
make
mistake
in
relying
on
something
i’ve
written
in
this
field.
justice
hugo
l.
black
our
case
is
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
you
had
said
for
the
license,
am
i
wrong?
now
i
understand
united
says
not
a
license
fee
but
i
thought
you
just
had
said
it
was
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
it
does
put
you,
does
put
you
in
jail.
it
does
put
you
in
jail.
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
recall
it
the
naacp
failed
to
pay
a
$10
license.
i
thought
that
was
the
prosecutor.
justice
hugo
l.
black
still
not
--
i
think
you’d
find
it
was
100,000.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
was
thinking
it’s
what
that
was
rule.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
indicated
a
little
danger
not
paying
the
license
tax.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
in
their
state
taxation
system
of

there
is
