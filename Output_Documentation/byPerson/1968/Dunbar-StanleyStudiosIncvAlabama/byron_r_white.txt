justice
byron
r.
white
well,
as
i
understand,
you
say
that
you
are
not
making
an
equal
protection
clause
argument
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
don’t
rely
on
the
distinction
between
intenerate
photographers
and
fixed
location
photographers.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that
you’re
saying
it
is
discriminatory
against
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
don’t
say
that
it’s
discriminatory
against
itinerant
photographers,
except
that
it
discriminates
against
those
who
are
interstate
commerce.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
aren’t
you
making
any
potential
argument?
you
didn’t
raise
that
in
the
court
below?
justice
byron
r.
white
assume
that
you
say
that
--
do
you
say
that
the
clause,
that
the
law
does
not
discriminate
against
itinerant
photographers?
justice
byron
r.
white
let’s
assume
there
is
an
itinerant
photographer
solely
based
in
alabama.
assume
you
were,
would
you
say
that
you
had
a
valid
equal
protection
argument
against
this
tax,
because
the
tax
is
fixed
for
location
photographers
less
than
it
taxes
itinerant
photographers?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then
why
would
you
say
it’s,
aren’t
you
really
then
crowded
back
to
you
first,
your
very
first
point?
justice
byron
r.
white
it’s
really
license
on
interstate
commerce
because
it
isn’t
discriminatory,
without
reason
anyway,
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
your
court
characterize
this
license
tax
is
a
privilege
tax?
isn’t
a
license
deemed
to
amount
to
giving
a
personal
privilege
to
do
business?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean
it’s
not
an
--
for
inspection
or
for,
it
just
for
the
privilege
of
doing
business.
justice
byron
r.
white
without
that
they
can’t
do
business
in
alabama.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
for
the
privilege
you
are
doing
business
in
alabama.
justice
byron
r.
white
your
law
puts
them
on
different
classes
but
what
about
has
your
court
ever
explained
or
gone
into
the
basis
for
the
different
classification
and
imply
the
different
class.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
was
the
citation
to
that
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
was
the
citation
to
that
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
was
pretty
effective
business.
justice
byron
r.
white
because
the
statute
says,
for
any
person
or
a
corporation
engage
in
any
businesses,
they
shall
pay
them
the
probate
fee
which
is
or
the
tax
which
is
a
--
and
the
tax
is
there
and
saying
that
every
license
is
a
personal
privilege
to
transact
the
business.
that’s
what
it
said.
justice
byron
r.
white
this
business
some
people
will
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
claims
inside
the
--
didn’t
know
what
the
businesses
are
and
giving
your
license
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then
how
do
you
--
why
can’t
alabama
do
that
to
you
and
in
so
far
as
you
take
pictures
at
a
fixed
location
in
alabama.
justice
byron
r.
white
because
that
really,
dispose
of
you
--
that
would
your
first
point
isn’t
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
think
it
exposes
your
first
point.
justice
byron

white
and
your
first
point
and
your
last
point
are
inconsistent.
i

they
are
mutually
exclusive.

you
