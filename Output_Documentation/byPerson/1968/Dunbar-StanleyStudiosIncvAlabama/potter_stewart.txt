justice

stewart
which
business,
what
sector?
justice
potter
stewart
so
what’s
the
business
for
transit?
justice
potter
stewart
as
being.
justice
potter
stewart
and
does
what?
justice
potter
stewart
does
he
stops
with
that?
justice
potter
stewart
conducts
settings
and
develop
the
pictures
and
all
the
rest.
justice
potter
stewart
now
let
me
ask
mr.
thorton,
if
i
understood
mr.
burton
correctly,
if
you
had
a
photographer
based
in
montgomery
and
he
sent
photographers
around
this
--
among
the
six
adjoining
counties,
but
all
of
the
work
was
done
in
the
state
of
alabama,
nevertheless
under
this
statute
as
to
the
activities
of
those
photographers
who
went
around
in
the
six
states,
the
license
fee
would
be
$5
a
week.
the
$25
a
week
would
be
reserved
for
what
was
done
at
the
fixed
location,
do
you
agree
with
that?
justice
potter
stewart
now
suppose
in
that
very
situation,
all
that
happened
or
rather
instead
of
developing
everything
in
the
state
of
alabama,
of
the
pictures
taken
by
those
photographers
who
went
around
the
six
counties.
this
photographer
sent
that
part
of
the
business
out
of
state,
would
you
be
making
the
same
argument
that
then
this
would
be
discriminatory
against
interstate
commerce?
justice
potter
stewart
no
on
the
$5
license.
justice
potter
stewart
that’s
right.
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
but
i
gather
then
if
you’re
right,
then
all
--
the
photographer
who
now
does
all
of
his
work
in
alabama
would
have
to
do
to
escape
that
$5
week
tax,
would
be
to
send
the
developing
work
out
of
alabama
to
be
dealt
with.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
but
i
was
trying
to
get
what
your
view
would
be
of
the
position
where
everything
is
now
done
in
the
state
and
all
the
photographer
does
is
to
change
his
practice
to
send
the
developing
work
out
of
the
state.
your
position
then
would
be
that
what
maybe
a
proper
tax
now
would
become
unconstitutional
tax
to
the
extent
of
the
extent
of
the
$5
a
week
charge.
well
that
is
this
case,
isn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
the
only
reason
they
put
you
in
the
transient
class
because
you
sent
your
pictures
outside.
justice
potter
stewart
how
can
they
cure
it?
justice
potter
stewart
how
can
they
cure?
justice
potter
stewart
how
can
it
be
cured?
you
say
you
can
cure
that
so
easily.
justice
potter
stewart
for
whom?
justice
potter
stewart
well
how
they
prove
you
are
transient?
justice
potter
stewart
but
how
could
they
ever
prove
that
you
are
transient,
whether
if
they
amended
the
ordinance
like
this.
justice
potter
stewart
you
see,
you
would
still
object
to
the
$25
a
year.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that’s
your
--
that’s
the
point
you
would
like
us
to
--
justice
potter
stewart
they
can’t
tax
you
at
all.
justice
potter
stewart
now
let’s
suppose
i’m
making
--
that
i’m
a
manufacturing
steel
products,
selling
them
all
over
the
country
and
i
decide
to
establish
an
office,
a
sales
office
in
alabama,
montgomery.
i
establish
an
office,
put
several
employees
in
there
and
the
state
says,
look
if
you’re
going
to
establish
a
local
office
here,
you’ve
got
to
get
a
license
and
yet
every
order
that’s
taken
is
sent
out
of
the
state
and
billed
from
out
of
the
state.
would
you
say
alabama
could
not
make
them
take
out
a
license
to
set
up
a
local
office?
justice
potter
stewart
because
your
last
point
starts
out
with
the
proposition
that
we
are
taking
photographs
in
a
fixed
location.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
only
reason
you
make
an
itinerant
out
of
this
is
because
we
send
the
photographs
out
of
the
state.
justice
potter
stewart
but
if
you
say
you’re
taking
photographs
in

it

me

would

put
