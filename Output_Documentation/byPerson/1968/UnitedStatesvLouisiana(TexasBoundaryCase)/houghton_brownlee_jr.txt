mr.
houghton
brownlee,
jr.
mr.
justice
black,
may
it
please
the
court.
as
i
remember,
the
last
time
we
were
here,
our
positions
were
almost
exactly
opposite
and
here
we
are
simply
because
there
is
a
difference
in
who
gains
an
advantage
as
the
simple
truth
no
matter.
we
were
told
quite
plainly
in
the
opinion
that
what
congress
intended
was
to
give
us
back
what
if
we
had
in
1945
all
that
area
that
we've
had
in
1845.
even
one
sentence
in
the
majority
opinion
states
that
it's
extremely
clear,
no
new
state
boundaries
being
created
by
a
state
which
qualifies
and
i'm
talking
about
this
historical
claim.
simply
is
being
given
the
same
area
it
had
when
it
entered
the
union.
now,
there
is
only
one
possible
way
to
do
that
and
that's
to
use
a
fixed
historic
boundary.
otherwise,
erosion
is
going
to
take
away
something
from
texas.
that's
the
only
possible
way
to
give
that
effect
to
the
congressional
intent
is
to
measure
from
the
fixed
historic
1845
boundary
as
the
majority
opinion
said.
i'm
saying
simply
this
sir
that
the
only
way
that
the
court
can
give
effect
to
the
congressional
intent
to
give
back
to
texas
the
same
area
it
had
when
it
entered
the
union
is
to
measure
from
fixed
historical
boundary
three
leagues
out.
and
that's
the
only
possible
way
to
include
all
of
that
area
because
we
have
lost
somewhere
between
17
and
35,000
acres
through
erosion.
now,
i
can't
tell
you
the
exact
amounts
involved
because
we
don't
know.
we
have
one
set
of
engineers
that
said
35.
they
have
another
set
of
engineers
that
said
17
while
it's
somewhere
in
there.
in
any
event,
it's
important
enough
to
tell
his
position
on
as
far
as
the
government
is
concerned,
they
started
out
saying,
“you're
stuck
with
1845
because
they
didn't
want
us
to
have
the
jetties.”
we
were
saying
we
want
1953
or
present
because
we
want
the
jetties.
well
now
that
they
got
the
jetties
cut
away
from
us,
they
want
to
use
the
historic
boundary
only
when
it
hurts
us
and
use
the
modern
boundary
when
it
hurts
us.
in
other
words,
we
don't
win
either
way.
there's
no
way
we
can
come
out
ahead
in
this
proposition.
sir.
mr.
houghton
brownlee,
jr.
yes
sir,
they
certainly
do.
i
just
don't
think
though
that
one
should
attribute
an
intention
on
the
part
of
congress
to
philosophy
of
these
heads
the
government
wins
and
tails
the
state
to
lose.
i
mean,
that's
just
basically
unfair.
now,
i
think
i
can
explain
why
this
limitation
was
put
into
the
act.
this
one
in
2
(b)
that
he
was
referring
to
which
incidentally
does
not
contain
the
word
present.
it
was
put
in
there
because
texas
and
louisiana
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
submerged
lands
act
had
sought
unilaterally
by
legislation
of
their
own
states
to
show
their
boundaries
out
to
the
edge
of
the
continental
shelf.
they
wanted
to
make
sure
that
texas
didn't
get
more
than
three
leagues
from
its
ancient
historic
boundary.
they
want
to
make
sure
that
no
other
state
got
more
than
three
leagues
from
whatever
historical
boundary
it
could
prove
up.
well,
the
one
we
proved
up
was
this
1845
line
which
we've
now
more
or
less
got
located
on
the
ground.
i
think
this
is
simply
explanation
as
to
why
this
limiting
phrase
was
put
in
the
definitions
by
the
congress.
mr.
houghton
brownlee,
jr.
from
this
stipulated
line.
mr.
houghton
brownlee,
jr.
the
one
which
the
government
and
we
and
the
government
both
worked
out.
we
started
with
maps
in
1850
and
we
spent
about
$6,000.00
on
engineering
fees
to
locate
these
lines.
it's
very
in
field
notes.
we
had
to
conform
it
to
the
1927
north
american
datum.
we
had
to
go
through
a
lot
of
work.
mr.
houghton
brownlee,
jr.
well,
that's
just
the
graphic
illustration,
yes.
mr.
houghton
brownlee,
jr.
yes.
mr.
houghton
brownlee,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
houghton
brownlee,
jr.
correct.
mr.
houghton
brownlee,
jr.
right.
and
all
we're
saying
today
is
here
that
we
want
to
follow
what
you
told
us
last
time.
we
think
what
you
told
us
was
very
clear.
there
are
at
least
from
the
fixed
historic
1845
boundary,
a
fixed
line.
mr.
houghton
brownlee,
jr.
we
are
stipulated
on
the
line,
on
where
the
line
is.
we
haven't
stipulated
that
we're
entitled
to
that
claim,
no
sir.
mr.
houghton
brownlee,
jr.
well
i
think
--
mr.
houghton
brownlee,
jr.
we
didn't
argue
about
it,
no
sir.
mr.
houghton
brownlee,
jr.
no
sir,
it
was
not.
mr.
houghton
brownlee,
jr.
maybe
we
weren't
told
enough.
suppose
that's
true
but
reading
this
opinion,
i
see
at
least
10
references
to
the
fixed
historic
boundary
in
the
majority
opinion
and
see
one
or
two
in
your
concurring
opinion
and
i
see
one
in
the
dissenting
opinion
that
all
was
very,
very
clear
to
me
as
to
what
the
court
said.
now,
i
just
trust
what
the
court
meant
what
it
said.
mr.
houghton
brownlee,
jr.
that's
correct
sir.
and
we
--
i'd
be
willing
to
go
back
to
that
if
--
mr.
houghton
brownlee,
jr.
yes
sir,
it
is
a
strange
situation.
mr.
houghton
brownlee,
jr.
well,
we
were
dealing
with
the
entire
act
the
last
time.
mr.
houghton
brownlee,
jr.
i'm
not
really
certain
whether
that
is
in
the
government's
brief
or
not.
mr.
houghton
brownlee,
jr.
it
might
be.
i
think
perhaps
they
have
some
reference
to
a
limitation
of
that
kind,
i'm
not
sure.
i'd
have
to
go
back
and
check.
mr.
houghton
brownlee,
jr.
certainly,
historic
coast
--
coastline.
mr.
houghton
brownlee,
jr.
yes
mr.
houghton
brownlee,
jr.
that's
correct.
we
think
you
can
have
two
types
of
coastlines
like
you
can
have
two
types
of
boundaries,
one
historic
claim,
the
other
a
simple
grant
and
that's
how
our
case
was
distinguished
in
the
first
place
from
the
california
case.
see,
i
mean
i
think
really
the
problem
is
that
the
government
is
trying
to
have
it
both
ways
and
thus
this
doesn't
seem
inappropriate
intent
to
place
so
to
speak
in
the
matter
of
congress.
now,
--
mr.
houghton
brownlee,
jr.
yes
sir,
we
are
in
agreement
as
to
where
it
is
located
on
the
ground.
mr.
houghton
brownlee,
jr.
yes,
that
we
measure
out
from
that
line
wherever
it
is.
we
lose
whatever
erosion
that
may
have
occurred
at
that
time,
we
gain
whatever
--
i
mean,
we
gain
whatever
--
well,
we
would
have
a
line
in
other
words
but
we
would
pick
up
would
be
what
we
lose
between
1845
and
today.
and
the
actual
land
that
submerged
or
blew
away.
mr.
houghton
brownlee,
jr.
no,
it
was
exactly
three
leagues
from
the
then
coastline.
it
was
from
the
then
coastline.
well,
from
land,
from
land.
actually,
the
statute
read
from
land.
well,
i
would
say
from
land
is
where
the
texas
boundary
act
read.
now,
how
would
that
have
been
interpreted
at
that
time,
i
don't
know.
mr.
houghton
brownlee,
jr.
no,
i
have
no
difficulty.
i
think
it
was
what
we
would
normally
call
the
coast
today.
there
were
no
artificial
works
or
anything
of
that
kind.
it
was
completely
natural
at
that
time.
mr.
houghton
brownlee,
jr.
well,
it's
rather
strange
thing.
for
some
reason
or
another
way
back
there,
a
law
was
passed
establishing
a
boundary
that
was
prior
to
the
admission
of
texas
and
of
the
union.
we
tried
to
find
out
once
before
why
this
was
done
and
we
never
did
find
it
out.
all
we
knew
was
that
it
was
that
and
it
was
asserted
by
the
republic
as
its
boundary.
now,
there
was
a
lot
of
international
law
that
went
back
in
those
days
that
did
claim
the
boundaries
longer
than
three
miles.
we
got
into
all
that
in
the
original
case.
mr.
houghton
brownlee,
jr.
yes,
mr.
houghton
brownlee,
jr.
--
because
that
was
the
historic
--
mr.
houghton
brownlee,
jr.
no,
that
was
the
state
of
texas
in
that
1943
--
mr.
houghton
brownlee,
jr.
yes,
when
the
california
case
came
up
in
1947.
i
think
this
happened
after
that
time.
then
texas
runs
out,
passes
a
statute
saying
our
boundary
goes
out.
well,
of
course
that
was
a
futile
act
that
had
--
mr.
houghton
brownlee,
jr.
well,
to
the
edge
of
the
continental
shelf
about
200
miles.
mr.
houghton
brownlee,
jr.
it
was
a
futile
act
--
mr.
houghton
brownlee,
jr.
yes
sir.
that's
exactly
what
it
was.
louisiana
did
the
same
thing.
they
passed
a
statute
trying
to
stick
their
boundary
out
as
far
as
they
could
and
then
they
wanted
to
get
the
submerged
lands
act
passed.
well,
this
proviso
had
to
go
in
there
to
prevent
that
type
of
claim.that
was
the
reason
for
it.
mr.
houghton
brownlee,
jr.
well,
you
cans
look
at
this
exhibit.
well,
how
far
it
would
vary
with
these
red
lines.
now,
these
were
exaggerated.
mr.
houghton
brownlee,
jr.
well,
let
me
look
at
the
scale
beneath
and
i
think
i
can
tell
you.
the
farthest
point
from
land
would
be
--
let's
see
–-
oh!
it
looks
like,
maybe
at
one
point
as
far
out
as
ten
miles.
and
other
points,
it
runs
back
20
miles
into
the
coast.
mr.
houghton
brownlee,
jr.
near
louisiana,
near
the
sabine.
mr.
houghton
brownlee,
jr.
yes
sir.
this
would
be
--
mr.
houghton
brownlee,
jr.
i
don't
know.
i
was
looking
at,
oh
no
--
mr.
houghton
brownlee,
jr.
i
was
like
--
mr.
houghton
brownlee,
jr.
you're
right.
i
was
looking
at
the
wrong
scale.
mr.
houghton
brownlee,
jr.
yes
that's
right.
so
you're
right.
it's
not
nearly
that
far
out
nor
does
it
cover
a
very
wide
area
as
far
as
that's
concerned.
as
i
said,
it
makes
a
difference.
we're
not
really
sure
how
much.
but
we
do
not
believe
that
the
court
should
allow
this
proposition
of
--
you
can
use
the
1845
boundary
when
it
hurts
you.
in
other
words,
where
there
has
been
erosion,
you
got
to
use
it
where
it
hurts
you.
but
you
can't
use
it
where
it
helps
you.
we
say
that's
basically
an
unfair
argument.
we
think
it's
the
position
which
the
congress
did
not
have
in
mind
when
it
passed
the
submerged
lands
act.
and
we
feel
that
the
opinion
has
made
this
statement
by
the
court
at
least
very
clear.
we
don't
think
it's
at
all
ambiguous
and
we
see
no
trouble
at
all
in
reconciling
the
limitation
imposed
to
prevent
those
exaggerated
claims
with
the
other
definitions
of
the
statute.
thank
you.
mr.
houghton
brownlee,
jr.
mr.
justice
black,

it

brownlee,
jr.
right.
and
all
we're
saying
today
is
here
that
we
want
to
follow
what
you
told
us
last
time.
we
think
what
you
told
us
was
very
clear.
there
are
at
least
from
the
fixed
historic
1845
boundary,
a
fixed
line.
mr.
houghton
brownlee,
jr.
we
are
stipulated
on
the
line,
on
where
the
line
is.
we
haven't
stipulated
that
we're
entitled
to
that
claim,
no
sir.
mr.
houghton
brownlee,
jr.
well
i
think
--
mr.
houghton
brownlee,
jr.
we
didn't
argue
about
it,
no
sir.
mr.
houghton
brownlee,
jr.
no
sir,
it
was
not.
mr.
houghton
brownlee,
jr.
maybe
we
weren't
told
enough.
suppose
that's
true
but
reading
this
opinion,
i
see
at
least
10
references
to
the
fixed
historic
boundary
in
the
majority
opinion
and
see
one
or
two
in
your
concurring
opinion
and
i
see
one
in
the
dissenting
opinion
that
all
was
very,
very
clear
to
me
as
to
what
the
court
said.
now,
i
just
trust
what
the
court
meant
what
it
said.
mr.
houghton
brownlee,
jr.
that's
correct
sir.
and
we
--
i'd
be
willing
to
go
back
to
that
if
--
mr.
houghton
brownlee,
jr.
yes
sir,
it
is
a
strange
situation.
mr.
houghton
brownlee,
jr.
well,
we
were
dealing
with
the
entire
act
the
last
time.
mr.
houghton
brownlee,
jr.
i'm
not
really
certain
whether
that
is
in
the
government's
brief
or
not.
mr.
houghton
brownlee,
jr.
it
might
be.
i
think
perhaps
they
have
some
reference
to
a
limitation
of
that
kind,
i'm
not
sure.
i'd
have
to
go
back
and
check.
mr.
houghton
brownlee,
jr.
certainly,
historic
coast
--
coastline.
mr.
houghton
brownlee,
jr.
yes
mr.
houghton
brownlee,
jr.
that's
correct.
we
think
you
can
have
two
types
of
coastlines
like
you
can
have
two
types
of
boundaries,
one
historic
claim,
the
other
a
simple
grant
and
that's
how
our
case
was
distinguished
in
the
first
place
from
the
california
case.
see,
i
mean
i
think
really
the
problem
is
that
the
government
is
trying
to
have
it
both
ways
and
thus
this
doesn't
seem
inappropriate
intent
to
place
so
to
speak
in
the
matter
of
congress.
now,
--
mr.
houghton
brownlee,
jr.
yes
sir,
we
are
in
agreement
as
to
where
it
is
located
on
the
ground.
mr.
houghton
brownlee,
jr.
yes,
that
we
measure
out
from
that
line
wherever
it
is.
we
lose
whatever
erosion
that
may
have
occurred
at
that
time,
we
gain
whatever
--
i
mean,
we
gain
whatever
--
well,
we
would
have
a
line
in
other
words
but
we
would
pick
up
would
be
what
we
lose
between
1845
and
today.
and
the
actual
land
that
submerged
or
blew
away.
mr.
houghton
brownlee,
jr.
no,
it
was
exactly
three
leagues
from
the
then
coastline.
it
was
from
the
then
coastline.
well,
from
land,
from
land.
actually,
the
statute
read
from
land.
well,
i
would
say
from
land
is
where
the
texas
boundary
act
read.
now,
how
would
that
have
been
interpreted
at
that
time,
i
don't
know.
mr.
houghton
brownlee,
jr.
no,
i
have
no
difficulty.
i
think
it
was
what
we
would
normally
call
the
coast
today.
there
were
no
artificial
works
or
anything
of
that
kind.
it
was
completely
natural
at
that
time.
mr.
houghton
brownlee,
jr.
well,
it's
rather
strange
thing.
for
some
reason
or
another
way
back
there,
a
law
was
passed
establishing
a
boundary
that
was
prior
to
the
admission
of
texas
and
of
the
union.
we
tried
to
find
out
once
before
why
this
was
done
and
we
never
did
find
it
out.
all
we
knew
was
that
it
was
that
and
it
was
asserted
by
the
republic
as
its
boundary.
now,
there
was
a
lot
of
international
law
that
went
back
in
those
days
that
did
claim
the
boundaries
longer
than
three
miles.
we
got
into
all
that
in
the
original
case.
mr.
houghton
brownlee,
jr.
yes,
mr.
houghton
brownlee,
jr.
--
because
that
was
the
historic
--
mr.
houghton
brownlee,
jr.
no,
that
was
the
state
of
texas
in
that
1943
--
mr.
houghton
brownlee,
jr.
yes,
when
the
california
case
came
up
in
1947.
i
think
this
happened
after
that
time.
then
texas
runs
out,
passes
a
statute
saying
our
boundary
goes
out.
well,
of
course
that
was
a
futile
act
that
had
--
mr.
houghton
brownlee,
jr.
well,
to
the
edge
of
the
continental
shelf
about
200
miles.
mr.
houghton
brownlee,
jr.
it
was
a
futile
act
--
mr.
houghton
brownlee,
jr.
yes
sir.
that's
exactly
what
it
was.
louisiana
did
the
same
thing.
they
passed
a
statute
trying
to
stick
their
boundary
out
as
far
as
they
could
and
then
they
wanted
to
get
the
submerged
lands
act
passed.
well,
this
proviso
had
to
go
in
there
to
prevent
that
type
of
claim.that
was
the
reason
for
it.
mr.
houghton
brownlee,
jr.
well,
you
cans
look
at
this
exhibit.
well,
how
far
it
would
vary
with
these
red
lines.
now,
these
were
exaggerated.
mr.
houghton
brownlee,
jr.
well,
let
me
look
at
the
scale
beneath
and
i
think
i
can
tell
you.
the
farthest
point
from
land
would
be
--
let's
see
–-
oh!
it
looks
like,
maybe
at
one
point
as
far
out
as
ten
miles.
and
other
points,
it
runs
back
20
miles
into
the
coast.
mr.
houghton
brownlee,
jr.
near
louisiana,
near
the
sabine.
mr.
houghton
brownlee,
jr.
yes
sir.
this
would
be
--
mr.
houghton
brownlee,
jr.
i
don't
know.
i
was
looking
at,
oh
no
--
mr.
houghton
brownlee,
jr.
i
was
like
--
mr.
houghton
brownlee,
jr.
you're
right.
i
was
looking
at
the
wrong
scale.
mr.
houghton
brownlee,
jr.
yes
that's
right.
so
you're
right.
it's
not
nearly
that
far
out
nor
does
it
cover
a
very
wide
area
as
far
as
that's
concerned.
as
i
said,
it
makes
a
difference.
we're
not
really
sure
how
much.
but
we
do
not
believe
that
the
court
should
allow
this
proposition
of
--
you
can
use
the
1845
boundary
when
it
hurts
you.
in
other
words,
where
there
has
been
erosion,
you
got
to
use
it
where
it
hurts
you.
but
you
can't
use
it
where
it
helps
you.
we
say
that's
basically
an
unfair
argument.
we
think
it's
the
position
which
the
congress
did
not
have
in
mind
when
it
passed
the
submerged
lands
act.
and
we
feel
that
the
opinion
has
made
this
statement
by
the
court
at
least
very
clear.
we
don't
think
it's
at
all
ambiguous
and
we
see
no
trouble
at
all
in
reconciling
the
limitation
imposed
to
prevent
those
exaggerated
claims
with
the
other
definitions
of
the
statute.
thank
you.
