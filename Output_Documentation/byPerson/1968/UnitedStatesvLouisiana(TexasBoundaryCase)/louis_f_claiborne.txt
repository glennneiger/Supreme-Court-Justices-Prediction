mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
justice
black
and
may
it
please
the
court.
let
me
make
clear
at
the
outset
that
despite
the
title
of
the
case,
this
original
action
or
this
face
of
this
original
action
involves
only
the
state
of
texas
not
louisiana
or
as
might
be
otherwise
in
the
case.
it's
perhaps
fitting
that
the
court
herein
apology
first
for
having
to
hear
for
the
third
time
since
the
passage
of
the
submerged
lands
act
another
aspect
of
this
title
lands
controversy
between
the
united
states
and
texas.
one
might
have
hoped
that
eight
terms
ago,
when
the
court
decided
that
texas
unlike
most
of
the
gulf
states
was
entitled
to
historic
claim
in
the
gulf
that
that
historic
claim
was
based
on
the
republic
of
texas
boundary
act
which
defined
the
belt
of
texas
as
nine
miles
from
land
and
the
texas
coast
being
relatively
uncomplicated,
that
might
have
been
the
end
of
the
matter.
unfortunately,
however,
there
was
that
non-resolved
matters
which
came
before
the
court
only
at
the
last
term.
the
question
then
was
where
you
start
measuring
this
nine-mile
belt,
whether
from
the
present
coast
or
rather
from
the
historic
coast,
that
is
the
coast
in
1845.
the
court
there
determined
that
it
was
measured,
was
to
be
measured.
this
nine-mile
historic
belt
to
texas
had
been
adjudicated,
that
it
was
to
be
measured
from
the
historic
coast,
the
coast
in
1845.
therefore,
one
could
not
take
into
account
artificial
jetties
that
had
been
put
outside
of
harbors
at
the
galveston
and
sabine
pass.
when
it
came
to
translating
the
court's
opinion
into
a
decree,
we
discovered
that
we've
left
another
problem
unresolved.
it
was
easy
or
it
was
done,
it
wasn't
easy.
the
parties
did
stipulate
where
the
1845
coast
was
and
that
has
been
stipulated
in
a
written
client
stipulation
which
is
before
the
court.
texas
thought
that
the
next
step
was
simply
to
measure
nine
miles
out
from
that
which
was
done
and
that
line
has
been
stipulated.
however,
the
submerged
lands
act
contains
a
provision
that
no
state
not
even
a
state
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
is
entitled
to
submerge
lands
more
than
nine
miles
from
its
coast.
united
states
takes
a
position
that
nine
miles
from
its
coast
of
that
purpose,
for
the
purpose
of
its
limitation
means
nine
miles
from
the
present
coast
not
from
the
historic
coast.
now,
it
so
happens
that
the
texas
coast
has
eroded
substantially
over
the
last
century.
one
of
the
little
drawings
which
have
been
distributed
to
the
court
indicates
the
extent
roughly
of
the
erosion
and
the
extent
of
the
accretion.
the
portion
of
shown
in
red
indicates
the
erosion.
that's
what
concerns
us
today.
because
most
of
the
coast
has
eroded
rather
than
accreted,
we
do
have
a
difference
as
to
where
this
nine-mile
belt
ends
up
depending
on
where
it
begins.
now,
the
real
question
is
as
i
said,
whether
this
limitation
which
texas
acknowledges
and
which
is
stated
in
plain
words
in
the
submerged
lands
act
that
no
state
shall
take
more
than
nine
miles
from
a
coast
means
from
the
present
coast.
if
it
means
from
the
present
coast,
then
we
cannot
measure
from
the
old
coast
because
that
would
push
the
line
beyond
nine
miles
from
the
present
coast.
now,
the
effectiveness
is
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
justice
black,
this
problem
cannot
arise
with
respect
to
any
other
state
except
florida.
it
arises
with
respect
to
those
two
states
only
because
they
have
received
grants
which
come
to
the
very
edge
of
the
maximum,
the
maximum
for
any
state
being
nine
miles.
otherwise,
the
problem
would
never
arise.
while
florida
was
--
may
be
affected
by
the
decision
here
and
was
duly
notified
of
that
fact,
it
shows
not
to
participate
in
this
face
of
the
controversy.
now,
as
i
say,
the
effect
of
this
translated
into
one
small
segment
of
the
coast
is
depicted
on
the
chart
behind
me,
a
copy
of
which
in
small
form
has
also
been
distributed
to
the
court.
this
is
chart
prepared
by
the
state
of
texas.
but
it
shows
rather
clearly
what
the
difference
is.
last
term,
we
were
arguing
about
the
effect
of
accretion,
artificial
accretion
in
that
case
but
the
same
principle
applies
to
natural
accretion
whether
that
pushed
out
the
nine-mile
belt.
the
answer
was
it
did
not.
this
time,
we're
arguing
about
whether
the
effect
of
erosion
is
to
bring
in
the
line
because
otherwise,
this
final
line
would
be
more
than
nine
miles
from
the
present
shore.
again,
we
say
that
this
territory
is
not
properly
attributable
to
texas
under
the
submerged
lands
act.
now,
you
can
see
from
just
that
statement
that
texas
appears
to
have
at
least
two
advantages
in
this
case.
one
is
that
we
appear
to
be
saying,
heads
we
win,
tails
you
lose.
whether
it's
accretion
or
erosion,
texas
gets
the
benefit
of
neither.
secondly,
our
position
results
in
a
changeable,
movable
line
as
the
modern
coast
shifts
whereas
texas
would
have
a
fixed,
permanent
line
nine
miles
from
the
stipulated
1845
coast
which
would
not
be
affected
by
any
future
changes
one
way
or
the
other.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
up
to
the
line,
will
move
seaward
from
where
it
is
today
if
there
is
accretion
where
there
presently
erosion.
other
way,
if
this
erosion
should
disappear,
we
would
put
the
line
here
today.
ten
years
from
now,
if
this
erosion
is
recaptured
by
the
land,
that
would
shift
the
nine-mile
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
we
would
move
both
ways
in
some
areas.
now,
as
i
say,
the
superficial
attraction
of
a
permanent
line
which
is
already
been
stipulated
which
would
certainly
spare
this
court
of
any
necessity
for
future
litigation
if
the
texas
position
where
adopted.
we
recognize
the
simplicity,
the
attraction
of
that
position
but
let
me
say
as
to
the
first
point,
to
the
point
that
we
seem
to
be
same
to
texas
on
a
manner
which
way
it
shifts,
you
don't
get
the
benefit
of
it.
that's
not
entirely
true.
when
there
is
a
shift,
when
there
is
accretion
of
more
than
six
miles,
whether
that
be
by
natural
accretion
or
by
the
building
more
likely,
by
the
building
of
harbor
work,
then
we
would
push
the
line
out
because
in
that
instance,
we
would
say
to
texas,
“now,
you're
taking
not
under
the
historic
claim,
you're
taking
three
miles
which
every
state
has
a
right
to
do
from
its
modern
coast.”
this
example
is
illustrated
on
pages
20
and
21
of
our
memorandum.
that
may
be
a
small
compensation
for
the
other
effect.
the
reason
it's
a
small
compensation
is
simply
because
texas
is
in
the
unusual
position
of
having
a
nine-mile
belt
whereas
every
state
but
one
has
only
a
three-mile
belt.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no,
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
in
the
california
case,
mr.
justice
harlan,
with
respect
to
a
three-mile
line,
i
think
the
court
was
explicit
that
that
line
would
change
as
is
provided
by
the
convention
of
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
suppose
that
is
true.
perhaps
i
took
the
proposition
to
apply
equally
when
we're
talking
about
the
shoreline,
the
natural
accretion
or
erosion
to
that
shoreline
where
that
is
the
operative
definition
for
the
beginning
of
the
territorial
seas.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
court
in
the
california
case
did
advert
to
the
governmental
power
to
prevent
an
exaggerated
extension
of
the
coast
by
any
state
for
its
own
benefits
which
didn't
serve
a
national
or
a
navigational
purpose.
i
took
it
that
discussion
applies
equally
whether
an
extension
of
the
inland
waters
are
involved
or
an
extension
of
the
natural
coastline.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
justice
harlan,
i'm
not
in
a
position
to
debate
it.
i
thought
and
i'm
advised
that
california
case
did
in
fact
deal
for
segments
with
shore
as
well
with
the
line
of
inland
waters.
i
may
be
wrong
with
that.
it
has
certainly
been
assumed
by
all
parties
since
that
case
including
the
argument
of
louisiana
case
months
ago
that
shifts
in
the
shoreline
when
the
shoreline
is
the
coastline
would
affect
the
ultimate
three-mile
line
and
that
i
think
is
consistent
with
the
international
convention.
of
course,
the
court
having
held
in
the
california
case
that
the
one
in
the
other
are
the
same
that
is
the
international
and
the
national
line
where
the
line
is
three
miles
from
the
coast.
this
of
course
doesn't
apply
to
texas
since
here,
we're
dealing
with
a
nine-mile
line.
but
let
me
say
this
bears
on
your
honors'
point
that
the
appeal
of
the
texas
position
that
we
would
here
end
up
with
a
fixed
permanent
line
that
would
not
move
would
be
an
unusual
result
because
as
i
understand
it,
in
every
other
situation,
we
do
in
fact
have
a
movable
line,
certainly
we
do
where
inland
waters
are
involved
and
i
thought
it
was
clear
that
we
deal
with
shoreline
as
the
coastline.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
mr.
justice
black,
as
i
understand,
ordinary
property
law,
normally
if
one
owns
the
edge
of
a
body
of
water,
normally,
that
ownership
carries
with
it
a
right
to
the
accretions,
therefore
a
shifting
boundary
as
well
as
a
loss
by
erosion
if
the
water
eats
into
the
land.
so
that
the
normal
rule
of
property
or
boundaries
on
waters
is
that
they
do
move
as
the
water
recedes
or
comes
in.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
but
i
thought
as
i
say,
i
may
be
wrong,
mr.
justice
black.
i
thought
the
court
had
long
since
determined
that
we
were
faced
whatever
inconveniences
there
might
be
to
it,
with
a
shifting
line
of
those
lands
which
have
been
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
in
the
cali
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
only
say
that
it
would
be
odd
if
it
didn't,
not
that
it's
impossible.
of
course,
one
could
have
a
fixed
line
in
the
gulf
with
respect
to
texas,
a
movable
line
in
the
gulf
with
respect
to
louisiana
or
alabama
and
mississippi.
it
would
simply
be
against
the
normal,
that's
all
i'm
saying.
there
is
a
more
dispositive
answer
to
all
this
which
is
that
the
text
of
the
submerged
lands
act
makes
it
crystal
clear
that
this
nine-mile
limitation
beyond
which
no
state
can
take
whatever
its
historic
boundary
was
that
this
nine-mile
limitation
reads
from
“the
coastline”.
that
word
is
the
same
operative
word
that
defines
the
three-mile
grant.
that
word
is
expressly
defined
in
the
submerged
lands
act
in
section
2
(c).
it's
defined
there
for
all
purposes.
it
doesn't
say
as
used
in
this
subsection.
coastline
means
the
same
thing
each
time
it's
used
in
the
submerged
lands
act
and
it
has
been
defined
by
this
court
to
mean
a
measurement
that
modern
coast,
the
ambulating
modern
coast.
if
i
am
right
in
that
premise,
then
it
follows
that
this
nine-mile
limitation
must
also
be
measured
from
the
modern
ambulatory
coast.
the
confusion
here
arises
only
because
it
so
happens
that
texas'
historic
claim
is
nine
miles
and
the
limitation
is
also
nine
miles
and
there's
a
temptation
to
make
the
two
read
on
the
same
points.
it's
the
--
case
would
be
far
easier
to
view
if
there
had
been
a
12-mile
historic
grant
--
historic
claim
by
texas
only
nine
miles
of
which
was
cognizable
under
the
submerged
lands
act.
in
that
case,
i
don't
think
it
would
ever
occur
to
anyone
to
go
plot
the
1845
shoreline
because
it
would
be
evident
that
you
only
took
the
first
nine
miles
of
it.
and
even
clearer
case
perhaps
would
be
if
the
boundary
historically
in
the
case
of
texas
had
for
instance
been
set
for
the
southern
part
on
the
97th
meridian
without
any
reference
to
the
coast
whatever.
in
that
case,
it
would
be
a
great
waste
of
effort
to
go
back
and
see
where
the
coast
was
at
1845
since
the
historic
boundary
was
not
related
to
the
coast
but
was
set
geographically
arbitrarily.
in
that
instance,
one
would
of
course
read
the
nine-mile
limitation
of
the
submerged
lands
act
read
as
reading
from
the
modern
coast
readily
available.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that's
correct.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
exactly.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
there
certainly
was
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
exactly.
mr.
justice
stewart,
in
fact,
i
think
that
was
at
one
time,
the
position
argued
by
the
united
states.
i
thought
it
had
been
the
position
argued
by
the
united
states
in
the
california
case
and
i
thought
it
had
been
rejected
by
the
court
saying
no
we
don't
look
to
1953,
we
look
to
the
convention
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
i
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
i
can
only
repeat
and
apologize
for
my
ignorance
of
the
details
of
the
california
decision.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
and
this
may
be
an
inadvertence
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
don't
have
the
opinion
handy.
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
certainly
be
glad
to
furnish
to
the
court
whatever
reference
as
we
can
find.
my
best
memory
is
that
at
least
the
decree
in
the
california
case
set
out
the
definition
of
coastline
in
terms
that
at
least
imply
a
movable
coastline
when
it
is
related
to
the
natural
shore
that
is
where
it
is,
the
natural
shore
is
in
open
contact
with
the
sea.
i
had
taken
it
that
that
was
the
unanimous
view
of
the
meaning
of
a
boundary,
an
international
boundary
under
the
international
convention.
the
court
having
adopted
for
the
purpose
of
inland
waters,
the
international
rules,
i
had
supposed
the
same
was
true
here
with
the
three-mile
limit
or
in
this
case,
the
nine-mile
limit
is
defined
by
reference
to
the
shore
rather
to
the
line
of
inland
waters.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
i
only
see
two
difficulties
with
it
mr.
justice
stewart.
the
first
is
simply
one
of
determining
coastline
as
of
that
time
wrote
than
is
now.
however,
having
done
that
for
1845,
i
suppose
we
could
manage
it
for
the
next
(voice
overlap).
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
more
serious
problem
i
would
think
was
that
once
the
court
has
adopted
the
rule
that
the
three-mile
limit
internationally
and
the
three-mile
belt
assigned
to
the
states
is
one
and
the
same
then
of
course
we'd
be
running
against
a
different
rule
followed
by
the
state
department
for
international
purposes
in
viewing
the
convention
as
establishing
an
ambulatory
line
even
where
that
line
is
referenced
to
the
open
coast.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
i
don't
say
they
need
be
the
same
nor
they
need
be
the
same.
perhaps
there's
less
reason
for
them
to
be
the
same
in
the
gulf
than
on
the
california
coast
but
there
i
would
suppose,
you
couldn't
have
two
rules.
one
for
the
gulf
of
the
fixed
lines
of
1953,
but
in
california,
one
that
ambulates,
so
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
i
meant
to
say
perhaps
that
you
couldn't
have
a
1953
boundary
all
over
the
gulf
even
where
it's
three
miles
as
louisiana
or
alabama
and
mississippi
and
yet
have
a
different
rule.
i
wouldn't
suppose
one
could
have
a
different
rule
applied
in
california
simply
because
international
considerations
may
be
more
important
on
the
pacific
and
on
the
atlantic
coast
than
they
are
in
the
gulf
of
mexico.
but
i
would
think
one
might
also
and
this
is
somewhat
hypothetical
run
across
problems
of
a
narrowing
of
that
belt
to
the
point
where
texas
would
almost
lose
some
of
its
lands
or
louisiana
might,
if
you
got
a
very
shifting
boundary.
if
you
fix
it
as
of
any
given
time,
and
there's
a
substantial
accretion,
you
presumably
have
no
longer
any
water
belt
around
you.
this
notion
of
the
shifting
belt
is
more
consistent
with
as
i
think
normal
property
rules.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
i
don't
see
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
but
one
cannot
textually
read
the
three-league
and
the
three-mile
stipulations
in
the
act
as
starting
from
a
different
point.
they
both
start
from
coastline.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no.
then
texas
would
be
entitled
to
the
three-mile
which
every
state
is
entitled
to.
it
would
no
longer
no
take
under
its
historic
grant.
it
would
take
under
the
all
states
grant
of
three
miles.
it
would
shift
basis
for
its
grant
as
we
illustrate
on
page
21
if
the
land
goes
out
to
the
point
where
the
distance
between
the
historic
boundary
and
the
land
is
no
longer
three
miles.
if
it's
less
than
three
miles
we
give
them
three
miles.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
say
we,
congress
did.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
yes
subject
to
this
limitation.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
yes.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
yes.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no.
the
--
it
seems
to
me
all
the
discussion
if
i
may
so
last
term
about
artificial
harbour
works
which
was
in
turn
premised
on
the
california
decision
assume
that
that
where
the
shoreline
is
the
operative
baseline,
that
shoreline
is
under
the
california
decision
extended
so
far
out
as
these
harbour
works
are
filled
out
and
we
assumed
as
texas
did
that
that
would
result
in
a
shift
in
its
three-mile
belt
or
in
its
nine-mile
belt
if
that
was
the
proper
starting
point
as
we
assumed
it
would
be
as
both
parties
assumed
it
would
be
had
it
been
a
conventional
three-mile
belt.
the
only
reason
we
argued
it
was
not
was
because
texas
took
under
the
historic
claim
which
must
be
judged
by
the
facts
of
history
not
by
changing
facts
of
today.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it's
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
is
entirely
correct
and
as
i
understand
it,
that
was
the
basis
of
decision
that
your
honor
made
it
abundantly
clear
in
the
concurring
opinion
that
was
based
on
your
concurrence.
now,
let
me
end
on
this
that
i
do
not
think
one
can
consistent
with
the
text
say
that
coastline
for
the
purpose
of
this
nine-mile
limitations
is
something
fixed
as
of
1953
but
that
for
the
purpose
of
the
three-mile
grant
it
may
be
a
shifting
one
because
both
statements,
that
is
the
statement
of
the
limitation
and
the
statement
of
the
three-mile
grant,
both
reference
to
the
single
words
coastline
and
those
words
are
defined
once
and
for
all
for
all
purposes
in
section
2
(c)
of
the
act.
it
cannot
mean
one
thing
one
time
and
another
thing
in
another
time.
therefore,
if
i'm
right
about
the
california
case,
here
also,
this
nine-mile
limitation
must
mean
from
the
modern
coast
as
it
may
be
at
any
given
time.
we
have
submitted
decreased
to
the
court
premised
on
our
disagreement
as
to
the
theory.
however,
we
both
agree
with
each
other
that
if
the
government's
theory
of
the
united
states,
this
theory
prevails
its
decrease
beyond
it
and
likewise
if
texas
is
correct
on
the
law
its
decrease,
i
should
caution
the
court
that
more
sophisticated
computations
have
required
slight
amendment
of
the
figures
in
the
decree
which
are
not
appropriate
for
statement
orally
and
which
will
be
supplied
to
the
court
by
concern
by
both
parties
within
the
next
several
days.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
is
entirely.
the
only
difference
between
us.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
hopefully
not
though
i
must
and
i
think
the
texas
coast
being
as
it
is
uncomplicated
one
need
not
envisage
another
louisiana
case
for
the
court
at
the
next
term.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
in
one
sense,
mr.
justice
black
that
is
true.
that
is
the
way
it
works
out.
now
because
we
--
it
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
but
we're
dealing
with
two
quite
separate
provisions.
one
is
the
provision
which
the
court
held
last
time
determines
the
extent
of
the
historic
claim
it
being
a
historic
claim.
it
was
properly
to
be
measured
from
the
historic
shore.
that
is
what
the
court
held.
and
that
of
course
is
what
we
argued
last
time.
now,
we're
dealing
with
something
quite
different.
we're
dealing
with
a
maximum
limitation
which
is
stated
to
be
from
a
coastline.
that
maximum
limitation
applies
not
only
to
those
states
which
--
well,
not
only
to
texas
in
terms.
it
applies
to
any
state
which
is
able
to
show
a
historic,
a
valid
historic
claim.
well
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
as
it
--
as
it
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
mr.
justice
black
this
three-league
or
nine-mile
limitation
only
applies
in
the
gulf
but
it
applies
to
all
the
gulf
states
and
it
simply
says
that
you
may
take
as
much
as
you
had
when
you
came
into
the
union
but
no
more
than
nine
miles
from
the
coast.
and
the
coast
is
then
defined
for
that
purpose
as
well
as
for
the
purpose
of
the
three-mile
grant
which
every
state
gets
and
i
can
only
say
i
thought
it
had
been
decided
by
the
court
that
that
meant
the
modern
coast
not
the
historic
coast,
not
the
1953
coast
but
the
modern
coast
as
it
shifts
time
to
time,
the
coast
today.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
this
proviso
was
added
as
i
understand
on
the
floor
rather
as
a
--
without
much
explanation.
it
does
appear
however
or
one
can
i
think
fairly
deduce
that
the
nine-mile
limitation
was
in
response
to
the
very
exorbitant
or
at
least
very
soft
generous
claims
made
by
texas
and
louisiana
and
had
also
by
louisiana,
now
that
i
really
don't
know.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no,
for
instance
in
the
case
of
louisiana,
the
claim
was
not
a
state
in
number
of
leagues
from
the
coast
or
at
least
the
definition
of
the
coast
began
so
far
out
that
this
practical
matter,
there
were
20
miles
or
so
out
into
the
gulf.
and
there
were
boundaries
set
was
straight
lines,
it
had
no
relation
to
the
coast
so
as
applied
to
louisiana,
this
nine-mile
limitations
couldn't
be
measured
from
any
historic
shoreline.
it
would
have
to
be
measured
from
the
modern
shoreline.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
was
just
nine
miles
(voice
overlap).
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
had
texas
been
the
only
state
against
which
this
limitation
was
designed
and
since
it
happened
that
texas
had
a
nine-mile
claim,
one
might
have
made
the
inference
your
honor
suggest
since
however
it
is
equally
fair
to
read
this
limitation
as
reed
against
louisiana
which
showed
a
different
sort
of
claim,
i
don't
think
the
conclusion
is
warranted.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
justice
black
and
may
it
please
the
court.
let
me
make
clear
at
the
outset
that
despite
the
title
of
the
case,
this
original
action
or
this
face
of
this
original
action
involves
only
the
state
of
texas
not
louisiana
or
as
might
be
otherwise
in
the
case.
it's
perhaps
fitting
that
the
court
herein
apology
first
for
having
to
hear
for
the
third
time
since
the
passage
of
the
submerged
lands
act
another
aspect
of
this
title
lands
controversy
between
the
united
states
and
texas.
one
might
have
hoped
that
eight
terms
ago,
when
the
court
decided
that
texas
unlike
most
of
the
gulf
states
was
entitled
to
historic
claim
in
the
gulf
that
that
historic
claim
was
based
on
the
republic
of
texas
boundary
act
which
defined
the
belt
of
texas
as
nine
miles
from
land
and
the
texas
coast
being
relatively
uncomplicated,
that
might
have
been
the
end
of
the
matter.
unfortunately,
however,
there
was
that
non-resolved
matters
which
came
before
the
court
only
at
the
last
term.
the
question
then
was
where
you
start
measuring
this
nine-mile
belt,
whether
from
the
present
coast
or
rather
from
the
historic
coast,
that
is
the
coast
in
1845.
the
court
there
determined
that
it
was
measured,
was
to
be
measured.
this
nine-mile
historic
belt
to
texas
had
been
adjudicated,
that
it
was
to
be
measured
from
the
historic
coast,
the
coast
in
1845.
therefore,
one
could
not
take
into
account
artificial
jetties
that
had
been
put
outside
of
harbors
at
the
galveston
and
sabine
pass.
when
it
came
to
translating
the
court's
opinion
into
a
decree,
we
discovered
that
we've
left
another
problem
unresolved.
it
was
easy
or
it
was
done,
it
wasn't
easy.
the
parties
did
stipulate
where
the
1845
coast
was
and
that
has
been
stipulated
in
a
written
client
stipulation
which
is
before
the
court.
texas
thought
that
the
next
step
was
simply
to
measure
nine
miles
out
from
that
which
was
done
and
that
line
has
been
stipulated.
however,
the
submerged
lands
act
contains
a
provision
that
no
state
not
even
a
state
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
is
entitled
to
submerge
lands
more
than
nine
miles
from
its
coast.
united
states
takes
a
position
that
nine
miles
from
its
coast
of
that
purpose,
for
the
purpose
of
its
limitation
means
nine
miles
from
the
present
coast
not
from
the
historic
coast.
now,
it
so
happens
that
the
texas
coast
has
eroded
substantially
over
the
last
century.
one
of
the
little
drawings
which
have
been
distributed
to
the
court
indicates
the
extent
roughly
of
the
erosion
and
the
extent
of
the
accretion.
the
portion
of
shown
in
red
indicates
the
erosion.
that's
what
concerns
us
today.
because
most
of
the
coast
has
eroded
rather
than
accreted,
we
do
have
a
difference
as
to
where
this
nine-mile
belt
ends
up
depending
on
where
it
begins.
now,
the
real
question
is
as
i
said,
whether
this
limitation
which
texas
acknowledges
and
which
is
stated
in
plain
words
in
the
submerged
lands
act
that
no
state
shall
take
more
than
nine
miles
from
a
coast
means
from
the
present
coast.
if
it
means
from
the
present
coast,
then
we
cannot
measure
from
the
old
coast
because
that
would
push
the
line
beyond
nine
miles
from
the
present
coast.
now,
the
effectiveness
is
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
justice
black,
this
problem
cannot
arise
with
respect
to
any
other
state
except
florida.
it
arises
with
respect
to
those
two
states
only
because
they
have
received
grants
which
come
to
the
very
edge
of
the
maximum,
the
maximum
for
any
state
being
nine
miles.
otherwise,
the
problem
would
never
arise.
while
florida
was
--
may
be
affected
by
the
decision
here
and
was
duly
notified
of
that
fact,
it
shows
not
to
participate
in
this
face
of
the
controversy.
now,
as
i
say,
the
effect
of
this
translated
into
one
small
segment
of
the
coast
is
depicted
on
the
chart
behind
me,
a
copy
of
which
in
small
form
has
also
been
distributed
to
the
court.
this
is
chart
prepared
by
the
state
of
texas.
but
it
shows
rather
clearly
what
the
difference
is.
last
term,
we
were
arguing
about
the
effect
of
accretion,
artificial
accretion
in
that
case
but
the
same
principle
applies
to
natural
accretion
whether
that
pushed
out
the
nine-mile
belt.
the
answer
was
it
did
not.
this
time,
we're
arguing
about
whether
the
effect
of
erosion
is
to
bring
in
the
line
because
otherwise,
this
final
line
would
be
more
than
nine
miles
from
the
present
shore.
again,
we
say
that
this
territory
is
not
properly
attributable
to
texas
under
the
submerged
lands
act.
now,
you
can
see
from
just
that
statement
that
texas
appears
to
have
at
least
two
advantages
in
this
case.
one
is
that
we
appear
to
be
saying,
heads
we
win,
tails
you
lose.
whether
it's
accretion
or
erosion,
texas
gets
the
benefit
of
neither.
secondly,
our
position
results
in
a
changeable,
movable
line
as
the
modern
coast
shifts
whereas
texas
would
have
a
fixed,
permanent
line
nine
miles
from
the
stipulated
1845
coast
which
would
not
be
affected
by
any
future
changes
one
way
or
the
other.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
up
to
the
line,
will
move
seaward
from
where
it
is
today
if
there
is
accretion
where
there
presently
erosion.
other
way,
if
this
erosion
should
disappear,
we
would
put
the
line
here
today.
ten
years
from
now,
if
this
erosion
is
recaptured
by
the
land,
that
would
shift
the
nine-mile
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
we
would
move
both
ways
in
some
areas.
now,
as
i
say,
the
superficial
attraction
of
a
permanent
line
which
is
already
been
stipulated
which
would
certainly
spare
this
court
of
any
necessity
for
future
litigation
if
the
texas
position
where
adopted.
we
recognize
the
simplicity,
the
attraction
of
that
position
but
let
me
say
as
to
the
first
point,
to
the
point
that
we
seem
to
be
same
to
texas
on
a
manner
which
way
it
shifts,
you
don't
get
the
benefit
of
it.
that's
not
entirely
true.
when
there
is
a
shift,
when
there
is
accretion
of
more
than
six
miles,
whether
that
be
by
natural
accretion
or
by
the
building
more
likely,
by
the
building
of
harbor
work,
then
we
would
push
the
line
out
because
in
that
instance,
we
would
say
to
texas,
“now,
you're
taking
not
under
the
historic
claim,
you're
taking
three
miles
which
every
state
has
a
right
to
do
from
its
modern
coast.”
this
example
is
illustrated
on
pages
20
and
21
of
our
memorandum.
that
may
be
a
small
compensation
for
the
other
effect.
the
reason
it's
a
small
compensation
is
simply
because
texas
is
in
the
unusual
position
of
having
a
nine-mile
belt
whereas
every
state
but
one
has
only
a
three-mile
belt.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no,
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
in
the
california
case,
mr.
justice
harlan,
with
respect
to
a
three-mile
line,
i
think
the
court
was
explicit
that
that
line
would
change
as
is
provided
by
the
convention
of
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
suppose
that
is
true.
perhaps
i
took
the
proposition
to
apply
equally
when
we're
talking
about
the
shoreline,
the
natural
accretion
or
erosion
to
that
shoreline
where
that
is
the
operative
definition
for
the
beginning
of
the
territorial
seas.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
court
in
the
california
case
did
advert
to
the
governmental
power
to
prevent
an
exaggerated
extension
of
the
coast
by
any
state
for
its
own
benefits
which
didn't
serve
a
national
or
a
navigational
purpose.
i
took
it
that
discussion
applies
equally
whether
an
extension
of
the
inland
waters
are
involved
or
an
extension
of
the
natural
coastline.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
justice
harlan,
i'm
not
in
a
position
to
debate
it.
i
thought
and
i'm
advised
that
california
case
did
in
fact
deal
for
segments
with
shore
as
well
with
the
line
of
inland
waters.
i
may
be
wrong
with
that.
it
has
certainly
been
assumed
by
all
parties
since
that
case
including
the
argument
of
louisiana
case
months
ago
that
shifts
in
the
shoreline
when
the
shoreline
is
the
coastline
would
affect
the
ultimate
three-mile
line
and
that
i
think
is
consistent
with
the
international
convention.
of
course,
the
court
having
held
in
the
california
case
that
the
one
in
the
other
are
the
same
that
is
the
international
and
the
national
line
where
the
line
is
three
miles
from
the
coast.
this
of
course
doesn't
apply
to
texas
since
here,
we're
dealing
with
a
nine-mile
line.
but
let
me
say
this
bears
on
your
honors'
point
that
the
appeal
of
the
texas
position
that
we
would
here
end
up
with
a
fixed
permanent
line
that
would
not
move
would
be
an
unusual
result
because
as
i
understand
it,
in
every
other
situation,
we
do
in
fact
have
a
movable
line,
certainly
we
do
where
inland
waters
are
involved
and
i
thought
it
was
clear
that
we
deal
with
shoreline
as
the
coastline.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
mr.
justice
black,
as
i
understand,
ordinary
property
law,
normally
if
one
owns
the
edge
of
a
body
of
water,
normally,
that
ownership
carries
with
it
a
right
to
the
accretions,
therefore
a
shifting
boundary
as
well
as
a
loss
by
erosion
if
the
water
eats
into
the
land.
so
that
the
normal
rule
of
property
or
boundaries
on
waters
is
that
they
do
move
as
the
water
recedes
or
comes
in.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
but
i
thought
as
i
say,
i
may
be
wrong,
mr.
justice
black.
i
thought
the
court
had
long
since
determined
that
we
were
faced
whatever
inconveniences
there
might
be
to
it,
with
a
shifting
line
of
those
lands
which
have
been
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
in
the
cali
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
only
say
that
it
would
be
odd
if
it
didn't,
not
that
it's
impossible.
of
course,
one
could
have
a
fixed
line
in
the
gulf
with
respect
to
texas,
a
movable
line
in
the
gulf
with
respect
to
louisiana
or
alabama
and
mississippi.
it
would
simply
be
against
the
normal,
that's
all
i'm
saying.
there
is
a
more
dispositive
answer
to
all
this
which
is
that
the
text
of
the
submerged
lands
act
makes
it
crystal
clear
that
this
nine-mile
limitation
beyond
which
no
state
can
take
whatever
its
historic
boundary
was
that
this
nine-mile
limitation
reads
from
“the
coastline”.
that
word
is
the
same
operative
word
that
defines
the
three-mile
grant.
that
word
is
expressly
defined
in
the
submerged
lands
act
in
section
2
(c).
it's
defined
there
for
all
purposes.
it
doesn't
say
as
used
in
this
subsection.
coastline
means
the
same
thing
each
time
it's
used
in
the
submerged
lands
act
and
it
has
been
defined
by
this
court
to
mean
a
measurement
that
modern
coast,
the
ambulating
modern
coast.
if
i
am
right
in
that
premise,
then
it
follows
that
this
nine-mile
limitation
must
also
be
measured
from
the
modern
ambulatory
coast.
the
confusion
here
arises
only
because
it
so
happens
that
texas'
historic
claim
is
nine
miles
and
the
limitation
is
also
nine
miles
and
there's
a
temptation
to
make
the
two
read
on
the
same
points.
it's
the
--
case
would
be
far
easier
to
view
if
there
had
been
a
12-mile
historic
grant
--
historic
claim
by
texas
only
nine
miles
of
which
was
cognizable
under
the
submerged
lands
act.
in
that
case,
i
don't
think
it
would
ever
occur
to
anyone
to
go
plot
the
1845
shoreline
because
it
would
be
evident
that
you
only
took
the
first
nine
miles
of
it.
and
even
clearer
case
perhaps
would
be
if
the
boundary
historically
in
the
case
of
texas
had
for
instance
been
set
for
the
southern
part
on
the
97th
meridian
without
any
reference
to
the
coast
whatever.
in
that
case,
it
would
be
a
great
waste
of
effort
to
go
back
and
see
where
the
coast
was
at
1845
since
the
historic
boundary
was
not
related
to
the
coast
but
was
set
geographically
arbitrarily.
in
that
instance,
one
would
of
course
read
the
nine-mile
limitation
of
the
submerged
lands
act
read
as
reading
from
the
modern
coast
readily
available.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that's
correct.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
exactly.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
there
certainly
was
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
exactly.
mr.
justice
stewart,
in
fact,
i
think
that
was
at
one
time,
the
position
argued
by
the
united
states.
i
thought
it
had
been
the
position
argued
by
the
united
states
in
the
california
case
and
i
thought
it
had
been
rejected
by
the
court
saying
no
we
don't
look
to
1953,
we
look
to
the
convention
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
i
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
i
can
only
repeat
and
apologize
for
my
ignorance
of
the
details
of
the
california
decision.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
and
this
may
be
an
inadvertence
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
don't
have
the
opinion
handy.
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
certainly
be
glad
to
furnish
to
the
court
whatever
reference
as
we
can
find.
my
best
memory
is
that
at
least
the
decree
in
the
california
case
set
out
the
definition
of
coastline
in
terms
that
at
least
imply
a
movable
coastline
when
it
is
related
to
the
natural
shore
that
is
where
it
is,
the
natural
shore
is
in
open
contact
with
the
sea.
i
had
taken
it
that
that
was
the
unanimous
view
of
the
meaning
of
a
boundary,
an
international
boundary
under
the
international
convention.
the
court
having
adopted
for
the
purpose
of
inland
waters,
the
international
rules,
i
had
supposed
the
same
was
true
here
with
the
three-mile
limit
or
in
this
case,
the
nine-mile
limit
is
defined
by
reference
to
the
shore
rather
to
the
line
of
inland
waters.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
i
only
see
two
difficulties
with
it
mr.
justice
stewart.
the
first
is
simply
one
of
determining
coastline
as
of
that
time
wrote
than
is
now.
however,
having
done
that
for
1845,
i
suppose
we
could
manage
it
for
the
next
(voice
overlap).
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
more
serious
problem
i
would
think
was
that
once
the
court
has
adopted
the
rule
that
the
three-mile
limit
internationally
and
the
three-mile
belt
assigned
to
the
states
is
one
and
the
same
then
of
course
we'd
be
running
against
a
different
rule
followed
by
the
state
department
for
international
purposes
in
viewing
the
convention
as
establishing
an
ambulatory
line
even
where
that
line
is
referenced
to
the
open
coast.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
i
don't
say
they
need
be
the
same
nor
they
need
be
the
same.
perhaps
there's
less
reason
for
them
to
be
the
same
in
the
gulf
than
on
the
california
coast
but
there
i
would
suppose,
you
couldn't
have
two
rules.
one
for
the
gulf
of
the
fixed
lines
of
1953,
but
in
california,
one
that
ambulates,
so
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
i
meant
to
say
perhaps
that
you
couldn't
have
a
1953
boundary
all
over
the
gulf
even
where
it's
three
miles
as
louisiana
or
alabama
and
mississippi
and
yet
have
a
different
rule.
i
wouldn't
suppose
one
could
have
a
different
rule
applied
in
california
simply
because
international
considerations
may
be
more
important
on
the
pacific
and
on
the
atlantic
coast
than
they
are
in
the
gulf
of
mexico.
but
i
would
think
one
might
also
and
this
is
somewhat
hypothetical
run
across
problems
of
a
narrowing
of
that
belt
to
the
point
where
texas
would
almost
lose
some
of
its
lands
or
louisiana
might,
if
you
got
a
very
shifting
boundary.
if
you
fix
it
as
of
any
given
time,
and
there's
a
substantial
accretion,
you
presumably
have
no
longer
any
water
belt
around
you.
this
notion
of
the
shifting
belt
is
more
consistent
with
as
i
think
normal
property
rules.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
i
don't
see
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
but
one
cannot
textually
read
the
three-league
and
the
three-mile
stipulations
in
the
act
as
starting
from
a
different
point.
they
both
start
from
coastline.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no.
then
texas
would
be
entitled
to
the
three-mile
which
every
state
is
entitled
to.
it
would
no
longer
no
take
under
its
historic
grant.
it
would
take
under
the
all
states
grant
of
three
miles.
it
would
shift
basis
for
its
grant
as
we
illustrate
on
page
21
if
the
land
goes
out
to
the
point
where
the
distance
between
the
historic
boundary
and
the
land
is
no
longer
three
miles.
if
it's
less
than
three
miles
we
give
them
three
miles.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
say
we,
congress
did.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
yes
subject
to
this
limitation.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
yes.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
yes.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no.
the
--
it
seems
to
me
all
the
discussion
if
i
may
so
last
term
about
artificial
harbour
works
which
was
in
turn
premised
on
the
california
decision
assume
that
that
where
the
shoreline
is
the
operative
baseline,
that
shoreline
is
under
the
california
decision
extended
so
far
out
as
these
harbour
works
are
filled
out
and
we
assumed
as
texas
did
that
that
would
result
in
a
shift
in
its
three-mile
belt
or
in
its
nine-mile
belt
if
that
was
the
proper
starting
point
as
we
assumed
it
would
be
as
both
parties
assumed
it
would
be
had
it
been
a
conventional
three-mile
belt.
the
only
reason
we
argued
it
was
not
was
because
texas
took
under
the
historic
claim
which
must
be
judged
by
the
facts
of
history
not
by
changing
facts
of
today.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it's
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
is
entirely
correct
and
as
i
understand
it,
that
was
the
basis
of
decision
that
your
honor
made
it
abundantly
clear
in
the
concurring
opinion
that
was
based
on
your
concurrence.
now,
let
me
end
on
this
that
i
do
not
think
one
can
consistent
with
the
text
say
that
coastline
for
the
purpose
of
this
nine-mile
limitations
is
something
fixed
as
of
1953
but
that
for
the
purpose
of
the
three-mile
grant
it
may
be
a
shifting
one
because
both
statements,
that
is
the
statement
of
the
limitation
and
the
statement
of
the
three-mile
grant,
both
reference
to
the
single
words
coastline
and
those
words
are
defined
once
and
for
all
for
all
purposes
in
section
2
(c)
of
the
act.
it
cannot
mean
one
thing
one
time
and
another
thing
in
another
time.
therefore,
if
i'm
right
about
the
california
case,
here
also,
this
nine-mile
limitation
must
mean
from
the
modern
coast
as
it
may
be
at
any
given
time.
we
have
submitted
decreased
to
the
court
premised
on
our
disagreement
as
to
the
theory.
however,
we
both
agree
with
each
other
that
if
the
government's
theory
of
the
united
states,
this
theory
prevails
its
decrease
beyond
it
and
likewise
if
texas
is
correct
on
the
law
its
decrease,
i
should
caution
the
court
that
more
sophisticated
computations
have
required
slight
amendment
of
the
figures
in
the
decree
which
are
not
appropriate
for
statement
orally
and
which
will
be
supplied
to
the
court
by
concern
by
both
parties
within
the
next
several
days.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
is
entirely.
the
only
difference
between
us.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
hopefully
not
though
i
must
and
i
think
the
texas
coast
being
as
it
is
uncomplicated
one
need
not
envisage
another
louisiana
case
for
the
court
at
the
next
term.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
in
one
sense,
mr.
justice
black
that
is
true.
that
is
the
way
it
works
out.
now
because
we
--
it
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
but
we're
dealing
with
two
quite
separate
provisions.
one
is
the
provision
which
the
court
held
last
time
determines
the
extent
of
the
historic
claim
it
being
a
historic
claim.
it
was
properly
to
be
measured
from
the
historic
shore.
that
is
what
the
court
held.
and
that
of
course
is
what
we
argued
last
time.
now,
we're
dealing
with
something
quite
different.
we're
dealing
with
a
maximum
limitation
which
is
stated
to
be
from
a
coastline.
that
maximum
limitation
applies
not
only
to
those
states
which
--
well,
not
only
to
texas
in
terms.
it
applies
to
any
state
which
is
able
to
show
a
historic,
a
valid
historic
claim.
well
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
as
it
--
as
it
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
mr.
justice
black
this
three-league
or
nine-mile
limitation
only
applies
in
the
gulf
but
it
applies
to
all
the
gulf
states
and
it
simply
says
that
you
may
take
as
much
as
you
had
when
you
came
into
the
union
but
no
more
than
nine
miles
from
the
coast.
and
the
coast
is
then
defined
for
that
purpose
as
well
as
for
the
purpose
of
the
three-mile
grant
which
every
state
gets
and
i
can
only
say
i
thought
it
had
been
decided
by
the
court
that
that
meant
the
modern
coast
not
the
historic
coast,
not
the
1953
coast
but
the
modern
coast
as
it
shifts
time
to
time,
the
coast
today.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
this
proviso
was
added
as
i
understand
on
the
floor
rather
as
a
--
without
much
explanation.
it
does
appear
however
or
one
can
i
think
fairly
deduce
that
the
nine-mile
limitation
was
in
response
to
the
very
exorbitant
or
at
least
very
soft
generous
claims
made
by
texas
and
louisiana
and
had
also
by
louisiana,
now
that
i
really
don't
know.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no,
for
instance
in
the
case
of
louisiana,
the
claim
was
not
a
state
in
number
of
leagues
from
the
coast
or
at
least
the
definition
of
the
coast
began
so
far
out
that
this
practical
matter,
there
were
20
miles
or
so
out
into
the
gulf.
and
there
were
boundaries
set
was
straight
lines,
it
had
no
relation
to
the
coast
so
as
applied
to
louisiana,
this
nine-mile
limitations
couldn't
be
measured
from
any
historic
shoreline.
it
would
have
to
be
measured
from
the
modern
shoreline.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
was
just
nine
miles
(voice
overlap).
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
had
texas
been
the
only
state
against
which
this
limitation
was
designed
and
since
it
happened
that
texas
had
a
nine-mile
claim,
one
might
have
made
the
inference
your
honor
suggest
since
however
it
is
equally
fair
to
read
this
limitation
as
reed
against
louisiana
which
showed
a
different
sort
of
claim,
i
don't
think
the
conclusion
is
warranted.
