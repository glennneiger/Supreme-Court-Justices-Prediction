justice
potter
stewart
mr.
claiborne,
perhaps
i'm
--
perhaps
i
don't
have
this
mind
clearly
but
as
i
understand
it,
the
--
texas
is
contending
for
a
maximum
line
out
there,
three
leagues
from
their
1845
coastline.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
right.
and
you
are
contending
for
a
maximum
line
gulfward
of
three
leagues
out
from
their
coastline
at
any
given
time
now
or
in
the
future
as
you
said
in
your
brief.
justice
potter
stewart
isn't
there
or
not
a
possible
third
alternative
and
that
is
a
maximum
of
three
leagues
out
from
the
coastline
as
of
1953
when
the
submerged
lands
act
was
enacted?
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
you
refers
to
the
coastline
and
could
it
not
be
argued
that
the
congress
meant
to
be
referring
to
coastline
as
it
then
and
there
existed
on
the
date
of
the
enactment
of
the
statute?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that
was
really
only
with
reference
to
inland
waters,
the
inland
water
is
part
of
coastline.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
assuming
that
the
position
has
not
been
precluded
or
forbidden
by
mr.
justice
harlan's
opinion
in
the
california
case.
would
it
be
rational
third
alternative
argument
to
say
that
the
three
league
limitation
from
the
coastline
means
not
the
coastline
as
of
1845
and
not
the
present
and
future
coastline
wherever
it
may
be
but
the
coastline
as
it
was
described
by
congress
that
enacted
the
statute
referring
to
it
in
the
year
1953?
justice
potter
stewart
entirely
easy
for
108
years
later.
justice
potter
stewart
of
course
for
international
purposes
in
coast,
the
environmental
context
is
quite
different
along
the
gulf
and
the
way
it
is
in
the
matter
of
the
pacific
anyway
because
of
the
continental
shelf
act
and
the
variety
of
other
things,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
as
you
pointed
out
as
i
thought
that
you'd
pointed
out,
this
case
--
the
decision
in
this
case
will
have
a
reference
only
to
would
have
an
impact
only
upon
texas
and
upon
florida
because
of
our
earlier
decision.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
except
that
texas
took
in
last
term's
case
and
in
fact
that
texas'
claim
is
under
the
definition
of
the
--
in
the
1953
act
which
does
not
contend
the
word
coastline.
justice
potter
stewart
which
is
the
boundaries
as
they
existed
and
such
state
became
a
member
of
the
union
and
then
another
provision
of
the
act
to
be
establish
as
a
maximum
as
you
pointed
out
but
the
definition
under
which
they
claimed
is
not
contained
the
phrase
coastline,
isn't
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
except
--
justice
potter
stewart
you
said
last
time,
the
court
was
not
concerned
at
all,
was
it
with
the
proviso
of
section
2
(b).
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
accurate
or
not?
justice
potter
stewart
you
mean
that
wasn't
an
issue?
justice
potter
stewart
so
really,
you
can't
--
it's
not
quite
accurate
to
say
that
we
told
you
anything
last
time
with
respect
to
the
proviso
of
2
(b),
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
are
dealing
with
a
different
section
of
the
act.
justice
potter
stewart
we
were
not
dealing
with
it
the
last
time.
or
unless
you
tell
me
if
i'm
factually
wrong.
we
were
--
there
was
no
issues
last
time
under
the
section
2
(b)
proviso,
is
that
true
or
not
true?
it's
just
as
a
matter
of
fact?
justice
potter
stewart
oh,
i
don't
--
didn't
take
there
was
any
claim.
