justice
potter
stewart
right
there,
mr.
solicitor
general,
did
the
--
was
it
the
board
which
selected
this
groups
who
should
receive
invitations
to
--
justice
potter
stewart
in
other
words,
this--
unlike
the
rule
making
procedure,
this
was
not
left
open
for
anybody
in
this
system.
justice
potter
stewart
it
was
--
these
were
--
i
see,
these
were
invitations
to
a
somewhat
exclusive
group,
or
at
least
--
justice
potter
stewart
so,
the
effect
of
this
was
to
prevent
any
judicial
review?
the
excelsior
case
itself,
i
suppose,
because
the
excelsior
case
decided
in
the
favor
of
the
employer,
didn't
it?
and,
the
only
way
you
could've
--
in
other
words
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
employer
then
had
no
duty
to
bargain
with
either
one
of
the
unions.
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
that's
what
i
mean.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
--
my
question
was
directed
to
the
practical
effect
of
what
the
board
did
in
the
excelsior
case.
my
--
justice
potter
stewart
by
writing
in
an
opinion
in
favor
of
the
unions
and
making
a
decision
in
favor
of
the
employer.
the
board
in
fact,
deliberately
or
otherwise,
good
or
bad,
rightly
or
wrongly,
significantly
or
insignificantly
did
prevent
judicial
review
of
its
opinion
in
ruling
in
that
case,
didn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
except
by
refusal
to
bargain.
and,
here,
the
court's
--
justice
potter
stewart
decision
was
that
the
employer
had
no
duty
to
bargain.
justice
potter
stewart
which
could
stop
the
election,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
but
in
the
excelsior
case
the
employer
could
not
have
been
guilty
of
a
refusal
to
bargain
because
the
decision
in
that
case,
unless
i
misunderstood
what
you
said,
was
in
favor
of
the
employer
that
he
did
not
have
to
recognize
the
union.
justice
potter
stewart
as
i
understand,
it's
not
--
is
it
your
submission
that
the
failure
would
be
an
unfair
labor
practice?
justice
potter
stewart
the
case
is
so
far,
as
i
understood
your
answer
to
mr.
justice
fortas,
have
all
arise
as
this
one
did,
that
is,
by
--
and
in
all
the
other
cases,
the
district
courts
enforced
the
board's
efforts
to
require
the
employer
to
furnish
the
list.
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
that
case
arose,
i
gather
from
just
reading
its
description
in
the
respondent's
brief,
as
though
this
--
we
have
before
us
now
the
excelsior
case
itself.
is
that
right?
although,
i
suppose,
it's
a
bit
different.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
in
that
case,
the
lower
court
had
held
that
the
promulgation
of
a
rule
for
future
application,
though
done
in
the
course
of
an
adjudicatory
proceeding
--
justice
potter
stewart
to
us.
justice
potter
stewart
i
suppose
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
issue
is
the
same
however
it
arises,
i
suppose.
justice
potter
stewart
why
hasn't
the
board
used
its
explicit
rule
making
power?
is
there
any
--
did
--
has
it
ever
given
an
explanation?
justice
potter
stewart
even
with
respect
to
something
like
the
amount
in
contro
--
i
can't
think
they
phrased
in
term
of
art,
but
the
amount
of
money
involved
--
justice
potter
stewart
which
is
a
--
that's
a
rule
and
they
do
that
in
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
no.
justice
potter
stewart
right
there,
mr.

did
the
