justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
that's
--
i
hope
that
question
is
here
on
whatever
you
do
with
this
stuff.
justice
byron
r.
white
whether
--
even
if
that
rule
ever
going
to
give
the
list,
i
suppose,
proceeding
to
the
right
of
the
board
to
issue
a
subpoena.
you
mentioned
that
if
the
district
court
does
concur,
we've
got
to
decide
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
would
this
power
to
issue
a
subpoena
be
decided
the
same
way,
i
suppose,
even
if
the
subsequent
rule
has
never
been
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
it
need
to
operate
under
the
rule
which
is
now
the
subpoena?
do
you
think
an
order
that
this
gives
himself
should
have
an
order
or
is
that
one?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
does
having
a
report
that
--
having
made
a
rule,
i
think
the
excelsior
case
gives
anymore
powers
in
that
respect
when
the
courtroom
opened
up?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
the
rule
had
been
enacted
or
adopted
in
a
rule
making
proceeding
which
no
one
questioned,
the
board
would
still
have
an
enforcement
problem.
justice
byron
r.
white
just
like
this
one.
justice
byron
r.
white
but,
you
don't
get
--
you
don't
change
your
mandate
rule
making
rule
by
an
adjudication,
do
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
so
there
is
the
difference
--
justice
byron
r.
white
some
are
distinguished.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
young,
do
you
--
is
it
your
suggestion
that
this
is
the
only
way
the
board
could've
proceeded?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say,
no,
it
isn't
the
only
way
it
could've
proceeded
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
couldn't
it
made
this
one
in
adjudicative
--
justice
byron
r.
white
context
without
purporting
to
an
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
the
date
--
i
suppose
that
they've
decided
--
they
certainly
have
decided
you
against
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
what
did
the
board
do?
justice
byron
r.
white
issued
a
subpoena.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
the
board,
in
this
case,
this
concrete
case
now
before
us
has
said
that,
“in
connection
with
this
election,
you
must
furnish
the
list,”
and
you
said
“no,
we
don't”
and
that's
when
they
got
a
subpoena.
and,
we
have
the
validity
of
that
subpoena
at
issue.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
assume
that
subpoena
is
valid.
just
assume
that
for
the
moment.
is
there
anything
left
of
the
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
concede
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
might
end
up
--
you
say
the
subpoena
--
part
for
the
reason
for
your
saying
the
subpoena
is
invalid
is
because
of
the
excelsior
rule?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
would
be
the
same
question
whether
excelsior
had
been
adopted
or
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
how
is
the
rule
itself
involved
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
is
the
rule
itself
involved
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
was
also
issued
just
on
the
basis
of
the
board's
decision
in
this
case
if
they
want
the
list.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
even
if
their
rule
that
they
adopted
was
not
valid
that
they
might,
in
this
case,
have
said
“well,
we
think,
in
the
context
of
this
case,
the
employer
should
furnish
the
list
of
employees.”
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you
could
--
you
agree
they
could've
done
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
the
context
of
this
specific
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
there
cases
that
say
that
union
visitation
in
the
home
is
not
an
unfair
thing?
justice
byron

i
suppose
that's
--
i

that

on
