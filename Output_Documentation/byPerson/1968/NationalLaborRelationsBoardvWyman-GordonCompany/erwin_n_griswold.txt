mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
presents
a
question
of
administrative
law,
perhaps
more
suitable
to
discussion
by
a
law
school
seminar
than
meriting
extensive
consideration
by
this
court
because
i
believe
that
there
are
decisions
of
the
court
which,
though
not
directly
authoritatively
appoint,
point
the
way
to
the
decision
which
should
be
reached.
the
legal
problem
began
in
1966,
when
the
national
labor
relations
board
decided
the
case
of
excelsior
underwear
company
in
156
nlrb.
this
opinion
appears
in
full
twice
in
the
papers
before
the
court,
once
as
appendix
c
to
the
petition
for
certiorari
at
pages
14
(a)
through
33
(a),
and
also
in
the
appendix
or
record
at
pages
12-28.
the
excelsior
case
involved
a
representation
election
proceeding
under
section
9
(c)
(1)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
the
vote
went
strongly
against
the
labor
union,
petitioner,
in
that
case
and
it
filed
objections
to
the
conduct
of
the
election.
one
of
the
objections
was,
and
i
quote
from
page
13
of
the
appendix,
“the
employer's
conduct,”
right
at
the
middle
of
the
page,
“the
employer's
conduct
in
refusing
to
supply
the
union
with
a
list
of
employees
and
their
addresses
for
the
purpose
of
allowing
the
union
to
answer
the
letter
referred
to
in
objection
number
one.”
in
due
course,
the
excelsior
case
and
another
case
came
before
the
board
for
a
hearing
and
it
determined,
and
here
i
quote
from
page
14
of
the
appendix,
this
too
being
in
the
excelsior
opinion,
“that
the
employer's
denial
of
the
petitioner's
request
where
the
names
and
addresses
of
employees
eligible
to
vote
in
the
elections
in
these
two
cases
presented
a
question
of
substantial
importance
in
the
administration
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.”
and,
the
board
then
invited
further
briefs
on
this
issue
from
the
parties.
it
also
invited
other
interested
parties
to
file
briefs
amici
and
to
participate
in
the
oral
argument.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
as
i
understand
it,
mr.
justice,
it
was.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
opinion
says
that
the
board
invited
certain
interested
parties
to
file
briefs.
it
was
not
like
the
rule
making
procedure
where
there
is
a
notice
and
whoever
becomes
aware
of
that
notice
can
participate
in
filing
briefs.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
but
a
rather
representative
group.
there
were
two
national
employer's
associations
and
six
labor
unions
which
participated,
but
i
agree,
it
is
not
the
procedure
prescribed
by
the
administrative
procedure
act
for
rule
making.
if
it
had
been,
the
case
would
not
be
here.
arguments
were
held
on
may
20,
1965
and,
on
the
basis
of
the
briefs
and
oral
arguments,
the
board
entered
its
decision
on
february
4,
1966.
that
appears
on
page
33
of
the
appendix.
in
its
decision,
the
board
concluded
that
higher
standards
of
disclosure
than
we
have
here,
before,
imposed
are
necessary,
and
it
established
a
requirement
that
will
be
applied
in
all
lection
--
election
cases,
quoting
from
page
17
of
the
appendix.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that's
the
point,
mr.
justice.
it
did
not.
under
this
requirement,
let
me
state
the
requirement
and
then
state
what's
next.
under
this
requirement,
“within
seven
days
after
the
regional
director
has
approved
a
consent
election
agreement,
the
employer
must
file
with
the
regional
director
an
election
eligibility
list
containing
the
names
and
addresses
of
all
of
the
eligible
voters
and
this
information
is
then
made
available
to
all
of
the
parties
in
this
case.
now,
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
harlan's
question,
i
refer
to
footnote
5
of
the
board's
opinion
on
page
17,
the
second
paragraph
of
that
footnote.
the
same
thing
also
appears
later
at
the
conclusion
of
the
opinion
on
page
27,
but
what
the
board
said
there
was
“however,
the
rule
we
have
here
announced
is
to
be
applied
prospectively
only.
it
will
not
apply
in
the
instant
cases,
but
only
in
those
elections
that
are
directed
or
consented
to,
subsequent
to
30
days
from
the
date
of
this
decision.
we
impose
this
brief
period
of
delay
to
ensure
that
all
parties
to
forthcoming
representation
elections
are
fully
aware
of
their
rights
and
obligations
as
here
stated.”
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice,
i
don't
see
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
there
was
no
opportunity
for
judicial
review
in
the
excelsior
case.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
but,
i
see
no
reason
why
there
can't
be
judicial
review
of
the
propriety
of
the
regulation.
indeed,
we
have
briefed
it
and
our
opponents
have
briefed
it
of
the
order
in
the
wyman-gordon
case
or
whatever
other
case
is
taken
up.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
practical
effect
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
precluded
review
in
that
case.
indeed,
there
is
not
generally
judicial
review
of
orders
in
representation.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
is
not
the
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
is
not
the
representation
case.
that
would
be
a
subsequent
unfair
labor
practice
case
which
might
arise
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
which
might
arise
as
a
consequence
of
the
decision
in
the
excelsior
case
but,
in
this
case,
there
was
no
such
subsequent
unfair
labor
practice
case.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
agree,
mr.
justice.
at
a
later
time,
if
the
--
a
year
later,
for
example,
if
the
employer
had
been
ordered
to
bargu
--
bargain,
it
could've
had
a
review.
there
is
potential
review
in
this
case
which
arose
six
months
later.
this
was
the
background
of
the
present
case
which
began
on
july
12,
1966,
about
five
months
after
the
excelsior
case
was
decided
when
the
international
union
of
boilermakers
filed
a
petition
seeking
to
represent
the
employees
of
the
respondent
company.
another
union
also
intervened.
the
regional
director
determined
that
an
election
should
be
held,
and
he
directed
that
the
company,
as
required
by
the
board's
excelsior
decision,
furnish
a
list
of
the
names
and
addresses
of
the
eligible
voters.
the
company
refused
to
furnish
the
list.
the
election
was
held
and
the
unions
lost.
the
unions
objected
because
of
the
company's
failure
to
provide
the
list
of
names
and
addresses.
this
objection
was
sustained
by
the
regional
director
and
by
the
board.
and,
the
regional
director
again
directed
the
company
to
provide
an
employee
list.
when
the
company
again
refused,
the
regional
director
issued
a
subpoena
requiring
the
company
to
produce
its
books
and
records
showing
the
names
and
addresses
of
its
employees
or,
in
the
alternative,
to
furnish
a
list
containing
that
information.
the
board
denied
the
motion
--
the
company's
motion
to
quash
the
subpoena.
when
the
company
still
refused
to
comply,
the
board
brought
an
action
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
massachusetts
to
enforce
the
subpoena
or,
in
the
alternative,
or
a
mandatory
injunction
directing
the
company
to
comply
with
the
excelsior
requirement,
and
that
is
this
case.
the
district
court
granted
an
order
enforcing
the
subpoena.
the
case
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice,
i
think
it
is
here.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
that's
one
of
the
arguments
which
i
hope
to
advance,
that
at
least
the
excelsior
opinion
is
a
great
dictum.
upon
which,
the
board
can
rely
in
making
a
later
decision,
which
is
this
case.
in
this
case,
where
it
is
charged
with
an
investigation
as
a
part
of
the
process
of
carrying
out
fair
representative
elections,
it
has
determined
that
this
company
should
provide
a
list
of
names
and
addresses
and
when
that
has
not
been
provided,
it
has
started
this
proceeding
in
court
to
enforce
its
determination
which,
as
mr.
justice
white
suggests,
is
before
this
court
now.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
seems
to
me,
you
might
--
well,
i
think
the
warning
of
the
excelsior
rule
eliminates
argument
about
fairness
which
might
surprise
--
which
might
be
made
in
answer
to
something
which
came
simply
in
this
case,
but
i
know
of
no
reason
why
the
board
could
not
have
made
no
excelsior
decision
but
have
decided
in
this
case
that
wyman-gordon
should
provide
a
list
of
names
and
addresses
and
have
started
proceedings
to
enforce
that
decision.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
believe,
mr.
justice,
that
the
only
orders
that
the
board
can
issue
which
are
susceptible
as
such
of
enforcement
in
the
courts
are
orders
in
unfair
labor
practice
cases.
beyond
that,
it's
--
it
has
power
to
issue
subpoenas.
it
also
has
power
to
make
orders,
which
it
can
seek
to
have
enforced
in
the
district
courts
under
the
power
of
the
district
courts
to
enforce
orders
made
by
agencies
engaged
in
the
regulation
of
commerce.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
perhaps,
analytically,
it
does
not.
it
certainly
provides
a
helpful
background
to
sustain
the
propriety
of
the
order,
in
that,
people
have
had
adequate
notice.
but,
i
think
that
we
might
have
very
much
the
same
case
here
without
the
excelsior
decision,
in
which
event,
we
would
not
have
problems
under
the
administrative
procedure
act
and
things
of
that
sort.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
board
would
still
have
an
enforcement
problem
which
would
be
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
which
would
be
very
similar
to
what
it
has
here.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice.
there
are
five
decisions
of
courts
of
appeals
sustaining
the
excelsior
rule
and
sustaining
orders
of
the
district
court
to
enforce
it
and
all
of
them
are
cases
analogous
to
this.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge,
there
has
not
been
such
a
case.
certainly,
there
has
been
no
such
case
in
the
courts
of
appeals.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice,
i
think
it
would,
but
the
unfair
labor
practice
proceeding
is
somewhat
complicated
and
prolonged
and
makes
it
very
difficult
to
carry
out
elections
promptly,
which
is
the
board's
duty
under
section
9
of
the
act.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
there's
one
district
court
decision
in
new
jersey
which
refused
to
enforce
it,
all
of
those
which
have
gone
to
courts
of
appeals,
the
board's
effort
to
enforce
has
been
sustained
except
for
this
case.
this
case
went
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit
in
an
opinion
by
chief
judge
aldrich,
the
district
court
was
reversed
but
judge
coffin
dissented.
the
basis
of
judge
aldrich's
opinion
was
that
because
the
excelsior
requirement
was
made
prospective
only.
it
was
rule
making
rather
than
decision,
and
that
it
was
invalid
since
it
had
not
been
promulgated
in
accordance
with
the
procedures
provided
in
the
administrative
procedure
act.
the
court
also
held
that
the
excelsior
rule
was
not
“procedural,”
but
was
substantive
and,
thus,
that
it
did
not
come
within
an
expressed
exception
in
the
administrative
procedure
act
for
procedural
matters.
and,
judge
coffin
dissented
on
this
point
too.
now,
we
come
to
consideration
of
the
legal
question
involved.
it
requires
consideration
of
the
language
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
and
of
the
administrative
procedure
act.
some
portions
of
these
two
statutes
are
set
out
in
appendix
a
of
our
brief
on
pages
55-60.
unfortunately,
despite
the
detail
of
these
statutes,
there's
nothing
in
them
that
sheds
much
light
on
the
precise
problem
now
before
the
court.
the
administrative
procedure
act
does
tell
an
agency
how
to
conduct
rule
making
proceedings.
it
does
tell
it
what
procedures
to
follow
in
adjudicatory
proceeding,
but
it
does
not
really
tell
when
a
matter
is
one
or
the
other.
that,
it
seems
to
me,
has
to
be
determined
out
of
more
general
principles.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
mr.
justice,
because
it
didn't
follow
the
administrative
procedure
act's
procedure.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
mr.
justice.
we
are
contending
that
it's
adjudication
and,
therefore,
it
did
not
need
to
follow
the
procedure.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
is
the
background
for
an
order
in
a
particular
case
with
which
the
party,
we
submit,
must
comply.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice.
i
think
there
is
just
a
decision
of
this
court
that
establishes
law.
the
decision
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
in
the
excelsior
case
established
the
ways
of
administering
this
particular
statue
with
which
the
--
with
whose
administration
the
board
is
charged.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and,
we
think
that
the
--
that
all
employers
are
under
a
legal
obligation
to
comply
with.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
i
will
say
the
same.
i
was
about
to
say
much
the
same.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
but,
it
is
the
same
as
is
a
rule
established
by
adjudication,
which
is
much
the
same
as
that
of
one
established
by
rule
making.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
were
this
an
amendment
of
a
rule,
mr.
justice,
it
might
be
more
difficult.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
there
is
the
decision
of
this
court
which
involves
that,
to
which
i
will
refer
later.
this
is
the
establishment
of
a
way
of
dealing
with
election
representation
cases
as
a
result
of
the
board's
experience
which,
in
our
view,
was
appropriately
adjudicatory
in
nature.
the
national
labor
relations
board
--
national
labor
relations
act
gives
the
board
broad
powers
to
administer
the
act
and
we
know
from
the
chenery
case
of
more
than
20
years
ago
that
such
powers
are
to
be
construed
broadly,
that
they
can
be
exercised
by
decisions
of
the
administrative
agency
reached
in
adjudicatory
proceedings.
it's
true
that
the
decision
in
the
chenery
case
was
applicable
to
that
case.
indeed,
that
was
part
of
the
problem
there
and
was
not
prospective
only,
but
there
is
much
in
this
court's
opinion
in
the
chenery
case
which
would
suggest
the
result
for
which
we
contend
here.
there
was,
here,
an
actual
controversy
in
the
excelsior
case.
there
was
a
hearing,
as
required
by
section
9
(c)
(1)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
there
was
extensive
briefing
in
oral
argument
and
a
full
reasoned
opinion
by
the
board.
in
its
opinion,
the
board
reached
a
conclusion
as
to
the
appropriate
rule
of
decision
for
such
cases,
but
then
held,
because
of
considerations
of
fairness
to
the
parties
then
before
it,
that
that
rule
should
be
applied
only
to
subsequent
cases.
we
submit
that
the
board
in
the
excelsior
case
was
engaged
in
adjudication
and
that
the
result
which
it
reached
in
determining
that
controversy
was
validly
arrived
at
in
the
process
of
adjudication.
it
was
a
real
case.
there
was
no
faint
issue,
no
effort
by
the
board
to
make
rules
simply
because
it
thought
that
would
be
a
good
idea.
the
matter
was
handled
in
an
adjudicatory
proceeding
with
all
the
care
and
safeguards
required
for
the
appropriate
consideration
and
resolution
of
a
case.
out
of
that
consideration,
the
board
came
to
a
conclusion
which
it
announced
as
its
decision
with
careful
reasoning
to
support
it.
the
decision
represented
a
departure,
as
decisions
often
do,
and
the
board
concluded
that
the
solution
it
reached
should
be
applied
prospectively
only.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
as
to
the
national
labor
relations
board,
i
am
not
aware
of
any
other
thing
like
it.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
but
there
are
many
courts.
there
may
be
administrative
agencies.
i
don't
know.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
mr.
justice,
i
do
not
know
of
anything
either
in
the
labor
board
or
in
other
administrative
agencies.
nevertheless,
in
determining
what
is
adjudication,
it
seems
to
me,
not
inappropriate
to
look
to
what
courts
do.
and,
decisions
which
are
prospective
only
in
their
operation
have
been
known
in
this
court
at
least
as
far
back
as
the
sunburst
oil
and
refining
case
in
287
us,
some-35
years
ago.
in
recent
years,
this
court
has
frequently
decided
that
certain
decisions
should
and
can
be
applied
prospectively
only
and
no
one
has
opposed
that
the
court
was
not
adjudicating,
not
acting
as
a
court,
when
it
did
so.
several
of
these
cases
are
cited
on
pages
22
and
23
of
this
brief,
i
haven't
had
a
chance
to
study
the
opinions,
but
allen
against
the
state
board
of
elections
decided
this
morning
appears
to
be
another
one.
and,
perhaps
the
cases
closest
to
the
present
situation
are
england
against
the
louisiana
state
board
of
medical
examiners
in
375
us
and
james
against
the
united
states
in
366
us.
in
both
of
which,
this
court
announced
rules
in
the
james
case
overruling
an
earlier
case
in
the
england
case,
clarifying
a
situation
which
was
uncertain
as
somewhat
as
in
the
excelsior
case.
and,
in
each
case,
the
court,
for
one
reason
or
another,
reasons
of
fairness
to
the
parties
in
the
particular
case,
announced
that
the
rule
would
not
be
applied
in
this
case.
in
the
england
case,
this
court's
words
were
“on
the
record
in
the
instant
case,
the
rule
we
announce
today
would
call
for
affirmance
of
the
district
court's
judgment,
but
we
are
unwilling
to
apply
the
rule
against
these
appellants.”
no
one
has
ever
contended
that,
in
the
england
case
or
in
the
james
case,
that
the
court
was
engaged
in
rule
making.
on
the
contrary,
in
both
cases,
this
court
was
acting
as
a
court.
it
was
deciding
the
cases
hen
before
it
and
articulating
the
somewhat
complicated
reason
which
led
it
to
the
conclusion
which
it
then
reached.
neither
the
england
case
nor
the
james
case
is
dealt
within
the
respondent's
brief
here.
i
should
point
out,
however,
that
the
respondent
cites
one
case
in
his
brief
which
is
not
dealt
with
in
ours
and
which
points
the
other
way.
this
is
on
page
13
of
the
respondent's
brief.
it
is
a
per
curiam
decision
of
this
court
in
chicago
&
north
western
railway
company
against
chicago,
burlington
&
quincy
railroad
company
where
this
court
affirmed
a
judgment
of
a
district
court
dismissing
an
effort
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission
to
enforce
an
order
because,
in
that
case,
the
interstate
commerce
commission
had
made
an
order
far
broader
than
the
matters
before
the
commission.
indeed,
the
commissioner's
hearing
examiner
had
said
that
these
matters
are
not
involved
in
this
case
and
no
consideration
has
been
given
to
them.
when
the
matter
went
to
the
commission,
the
commission
issued
a
broad
order
applicable
not
only
to
the
case,
but
to
the
whole
field.
now,
the
district
court
refused
to
enforce
an
order
based
on
that,
and
this
court
affirmed
it
per
curiam.
on
the
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
i
think
not,
mr.
justice.
i
think
that
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
it
was
in
--
the
other
parties
then
sued
to
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
to
prevent
the
enforcement
of
the
rule
and
future
applications.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and,
this
court
summarily
held
that
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
issue
is
the
same,
but
i
think
the
factual
situation
is
distinguished.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no.
well,
i
think
it's
distinguishable
from
this,
in
that,
there,
the
interstate
commerce
commission
went
beyond
this
case
and
decided
a
broad
general
proposition,
as
to
which
there
had
been
no
hearing
of
any
sort.
indeed,
the
hearing
examiner
had
announced
that
the
broad
issue
was
not
involved
in
the
case.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice.
i
don'
think
the
federal
register
act
has
anything
to
do
with
it
that
it
hasn't
been
relied
upon
by
the
respondents.
one
has
to
look
to
many
things
besides
the
--
what's
in
the
federal
register
to
learn
what
the
law
is,
including
the
decisions
of
this
court.
moreover,
the
federal
register
act
expressly
provides
that
its
rule
that
an
unpublished
regulation
is
not
binding,
is
not
applicable
to
a
person
who
has
actual
notice
of
the
rule.
and,
there
isn't
any
doubt
that
wyman-gordon
had
actual
notice
of
this
rule
and
deliberately
chose
not
to
comply
with.
so,
i
don't
think
the
federal
register
act
has
anything
to
do
with
it.
the
problem
of
how
you
find
out
what
the
law
is,
i
suppose,
is
the
lawyer's
problem
and
i
would
suggest
anybody
involved
in
a
labor
case
should
look
to
the
decisions
as
well
as
to
the
rules
because,
for
better
or
for
worse,
the
national
labor
relations
board
has
never
proceeded
in
the
rule
making
basis
and
there
is
no
material
in
the
federal
register
on
this.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
there
was
a
slight
explanation
last
fall
in
a
statement
made
to
congress
in
which
they
said
that
they
thought
they
would
sometime
as
far
as
i
know,
they
haven't
yet.
i
can
understand
why
it
is
the
nature
of
their
area
is
delicate
and
difficult
and
evolving
and
things
don't
formulate
in
rule
fashion
the
way
they
do
in
the
treasury
system
where
it's
fairly
easy
to
make
rules.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
but,
justice,
they
do
have
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
they
do
that
by
press
release.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
i
don't
understand
at
all,
i
can
say,
is
that
that's
not
involved
in
this
case.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and,
perhaps
i'm
glad.
there
are
other
contentions.
[laughter]
there
are
other
contentions
in
the
case
which
are
dealt
with
in
our
brief,
and
my
time
has
expired
so
i'll
have
to
leave
them
to
that.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
chief
justice,
may
i
make
a
correction
in
one
of
my
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
interest
to
a
question.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
was
asked
whether
there
were
other
instances
where
the
labor
board
or
other
agencies
had
made
prospective
determinations
in
adjudicatory
proceedings,
and
i
said
i
was
unaware
of
them.
this
was
a
clear
slip.
on
page
14
of
our
brief
in
footnote
11,
there
are
listed
several
other
instances
both
involving
the
board
and
involving
other
agencies.
this
is
not
a
unique
situation.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
presents
a
question
of
administrative
law,
perhaps
more
suitable
to
discussion
by
a
law
school
seminar
than
meriting
extensive
consideration
by
this
court
because
i
believe
that
there
are
decisions
of
the
court
which,
though
not
directly
authoritatively
appoint,
point
the
way
to
the
decision
which
should
be
reached.
the
legal
problem
began
in
1966,
when
the
national
labor
relations
board
decided
the
case
of
excelsior
underwear
company
in
156
nlrb.
this
opinion
appears
in
full
twice
in
the
papers
before
the
court,
once
as
appendix
c
to
the
petition
for
certiorari
at
pages
14
(a)
through
33
(a),
and
also
in
the
appendix
or
record
at
pages
12-28.
the
excelsior
case
involved
a
representation
election
proceeding
under
section
9
(c)
(1)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
the
vote
went
strongly
against
the
labor
union,
petitioner,
in
that
case
and
it
filed
objections
to
the
conduct
of
the
election.
one
of
the
objections
was,
and
i
quote
from
page
13
of
the
appendix,
“the
employer's
conduct,”
right
at
the
middle
of
the
page,
“the
employer's
conduct
in
refusing
to
supply
the
union
with
a
list
of
employees
and
their
addresses
for
the
purpose
of
allowing
the
union
to
answer
the
letter
referred
to
in
objection
number
one.”
in
due
course,
the
excelsior
case
and
another
case
came
before
the
board
for
a
hearing
and
it
determined,
and
here
i
quote
from
page
14
of
the
appendix,
this
too
being
in
the
excelsior
opinion,
“that
the
employer's
denial
of
the
petitioner's
request
where
the
names
and
addresses
of
employees
eligible
to
vote
in
the
elections
in
these
two
cases
presented
a
question
of
substantial
importance
in
the
administration
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.”
and,
the
board
then
invited
further
briefs
on
this
issue
from
the
parties.
it
also
invited
other
interested
parties
to
file
briefs
amici
and
to
participate
in
the
oral
argument.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
as
i
understand
it,
mr.
justice,
it
was.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
opinion
says
that
the
board
invited
certain
interested
parties
to
file
briefs.
it
was
not
like
the
rule
making
procedure
where
there
is
a
notice
and
whoever
becomes
aware
of
that
notice
can
participate
in
filing
briefs.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
but
a
rather
representative
group.
there
were
two
national
employer's
associations
and
six
labor
unions
which
participated,
but
i
agree,
it
is
not
the
procedure
prescribed
by
the
administrative
procedure
act
for
rule
making.
if
it
had
been,
the
case
would
not
be
here.
arguments
were
held
on
may
20,
1965
and,
on
the
basis
of
the
briefs
and
oral
arguments,
the
board
entered
its
decision
on
february
4,
1966.
that
appears
on
page
33
of
the
appendix.
in
its
decision,
the
board
concluded
that
higher
standards
of
disclosure
than
we
have
here,
before,
imposed
are
necessary,
and
it
established
a
requirement
that
will
be
applied
in
all
lection
--
election
cases,
quoting
from
page
17
of
the
appendix.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that's
the
point,
mr.
justice.
it
did
not.
under
this
requirement,
let
me
state
the
requirement
and
then
state
what's
next.
under
this
requirement,
“within
seven
days
after
the
regional
director
has
approved
a
consent
election
agreement,
the
employer
must
file
with
the
regional
director
an
election
eligibility
list
containing
the
names
and
addresses
of
all
of
the
eligible
voters
and
this
information
is
then
made
available
to
all
of
the
parties
in
this
case.
now,
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
harlan's
question,
i
refer
to
footnote
5
of
the
board's
opinion
on
page
17,
the
second
paragraph
of
that
footnote.
the
same
thing
also
appears
later
at
the
conclusion
of
the
opinion
on
page
27,
but
what
the
board
said
there
was
“however,
the
rule
we
have
here
announced
is
to
be
applied
prospectively
only.
it
will
not
apply
in
the
instant
cases,
but
only
in
those
elections
that
are
directed
or
consented
to,
subsequent
to
30
days
from
the
date
of
this
decision.
we
impose
this
brief
period
of
delay
to
ensure
that
all
parties
to
forthcoming
representation
elections
are
fully
aware
of
their
rights
and
obligations
as
here
stated.”
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
justice,
i
don't
see
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
there
was
no
opportunity
for
judicial
review
in
the
excelsior
case.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
but,
i
see
no
reason
why
there
can't
be
judicial
review
of
the
propriety
of
the
regulation.
indeed,
we
have
briefed
it
and
our
opponents
have
briefed
it
of
the
order
in
the
wyman-gordon
case
or
whatever
other
case
is
taken
up.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
practical
effect
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
precluded
review
in
that
case.
indeed,
there
is
not
generally
judicial
review
of
orders
in
representation.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
is
not
the
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
is
not
the
representation
case.
that
would
be
a
subsequent
unfair
labor
practice
case
which
might
arise
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
which
might
arise
as
a
consequence
of
the
decision
in
the
excelsior
case
but,
in
this
case,
there
was
no
such
subsequent
unfair
labor
practice
case.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
agree,
mr.
justice.
at
a
later
time,
if
the
--
a
year
later,
for
example,
if
the
employer
had
been
ordered
to
bargu
--
bargain,
it
could've
had
a
review.
there
is
potential
review
in
this
case
which
arose
six
months
later.
this
was
the
background
of
the
present
case
which
began
on
july
12,
1966,
about
five
months
after
the
excelsior
case
was
decided
when
the
international
union
of
boilermakers
filed
a
petition
seeking
to
represent
the
employees
of
the
respondent
company.
another
union
also
intervened.
the
regional
director
determined
that
an
election
should
be
held,
and
he
directed
that
the
company,
as
required
by
the
board's
excelsior
decision,
furnish
a
list
of
the
names
and
addresses
of
the
eligible
voters.
the
company
refused
to
furnish
the
list.
the
election
was
held
and
the
unions
lost.
the
unions
objected
because
of
the
company's
failure
to
provide
the
list
of
names
and
addresses.
this
objection
was
sustained
by
the
regional
director
and
by
the
board.
and,
the
regional
director
again
directed
the
company
to
provide
an
employee
list.
when
the
company
again
refused,
the
regional
director
issued
a
subpoena
requiring
the
company
to
produce
its
books
and
records
showing
the
names
and
addresses
of
its
employees
or,
in
the
alternative,
to
furnish
a
list
containing
that
information.
the
board
denied
the
motion
--
the
company's
motion
to
quash
the
subpoena.
when
the
company
still
refused
to
comply,
the
board
brought
an
action
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
massachusetts
to
enforce
the
subpoena
or,
in
the
alternative,
or
a
mandatory
injunction
directing
the
company
to
comply
with
the
excelsior
requirement,
and
that
is
this
case.
the
district
court
granted
an
order
enforcing
the
subpoena.
the
case
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice,
i
think
it
is
here.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
that's
one
of
the
arguments
which
i
hope
to
advance,
that
at
least
the
excelsior
opinion
is
a
great
dictum.
upon
which,
the
board
can
rely
in
making
a
later
decision,
which
is
this
case.
in
this
case,
where
it
is
charged
with
an
investigation
as
a
part
of
the
process
of
carrying
out
fair
representative
elections,
it
has
determined
that
this
company
should
provide
a
list
of
names
and
addresses
and
when
that
has
not
been
provided,
it
has
started
this
proceeding
in
court
to
enforce
its
determination
which,
as
mr.
justice
white
suggests,
is
before
this
court
now.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
seems
to
me,
you
might
--
well,
i
think
the
warning
of
the
excelsior
rule
eliminates
argument
about
fairness
which
might
surprise
--
which
might
be
made
in
answer
to
something
which
came
simply
in
this
case,
but
i
know
of
no
reason
why
the
board
could
not
have
made
no
excelsior
decision
but
have
decided
in
this
case
that
wyman-gordon
should
provide
a
list
of
names
and
addresses
and
have
started
proceedings
to
enforce
that
decision.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
believe,
mr.
justice,
that
the
only
orders
that
the
board
can
issue
which
are
susceptible
as
such
of
enforcement
in
the
courts
are
orders
in
unfair
labor
practice
cases.
beyond
that,
it's
--
it
has
power
to
issue
subpoenas.
it
also
has
power
to
make
orders,
which
it
can
seek
to
have
enforced
in
the
district
courts
under
the
power
of
the
district
courts
to
enforce
orders
made
by
agencies
engaged
in
the
regulation
of
commerce.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
perhaps,
analytically,
it
does
not.
it
certainly
provides
a
helpful
background
to
sustain
the
propriety
of
the
order,
in
that,
people
have
had
adequate
notice.
but,
i
think
that
we
might
have
very
much
the
same
case
here
without
the
excelsior
decision,
in
which
event,
we
would
not
have
problems
under
the
administrative
procedure
act
and
things
of
that
sort.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
board
would
still
have
an
enforcement
problem
which
would
be
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
which
would
be
very
similar
to
what
it
has
here.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice.
there
are
five
decisions
of
courts
of
appeals
sustaining
the
excelsior
rule
and
sustaining
orders
of
the
district
court
to
enforce
it
and
all
of
them
are
cases
analogous
to
this.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge,
there
has
not
been
such
a
case.
certainly,
there
has
been
no
such
case
in
the
courts
of
appeals.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice,
i
think
it
would,
but
the
unfair
labor
practice
proceeding
is
somewhat
complicated
and
prolonged
and
makes
it
very
difficult
to
carry
out
elections
promptly,
which
is
the
board's
duty
under
section
9
of
the
act.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
there's
one
district
court
decision
in
new
jersey
which
refused
to
enforce
it,
all
of
those
which
have
gone
to
courts
of
appeals,
the
board's
effort
to
enforce
has
been
sustained
except
for
this
case.
this
case
went
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit
in
an
opinion
by
chief
judge
aldrich,
the
district
court
was
reversed
but
judge
coffin
dissented.
the
basis
of
judge
aldrich's
opinion
was
that
because
the
excelsior
requirement
was
made
prospective
only.
it
was
rule
making
rather
than
decision,
and
that
it
was
invalid
since
it
had
not
been
promulgated
in
accordance
with
the
procedures
provided
in
the
administrative
procedure
act.
the
court
also
held
that
the
excelsior
rule
was
not
“procedural,”
but
was
substantive
and,
thus,
that
it
did
not
come
within
an
expressed
exception
in
the
administrative
procedure
act
for
procedural
matters.
and,
judge
coffin
dissented
on
this
point
too.
now,
we
come
to
consideration
of
the
legal
question
involved.
it
requires
consideration
of
the
language
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
and
of
the
administrative
procedure
act.
some
portions
of
these
two
statutes
are
set
out
in
appendix
a
of
our
brief
on
pages
55-60.
unfortunately,
despite
the
detail
of
these
statutes,
there's
nothing
in
them
that
sheds
much
light
on
the
precise
problem
now
before
the
court.
the
administrative
procedure
act
does
tell
an
agency
how
to
conduct
rule
making
proceedings.
it
does
tell
it
what
procedures
to
follow
in
adjudicatory
proceeding,
but
it
does
not
really
tell
when
a
matter
is
one
or
the
other.
that,
it
seems
to
me,
has
to
be
determined
out
of
more
general
principles.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
mr.
justice,
because
it
didn't
follow
the
administrative
procedure
act's
procedure.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
mr.
justice.
we
are
contending
that
it's
adjudication
and,
therefore,
it
did
not
need
to
follow
the
procedure.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
is
the
background
for
an
order
in
a
particular
case
with
which
the
party,
we
submit,
must
comply.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice.
i
think
there
is
just
a
decision
of
this
court
that
establishes
law.
the
decision
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
in
the
excelsior
case
established
the
ways
of
administering
this
particular
statue
with
which
the
--
with
whose
administration
the
board
is
charged.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and,
we
think
that
the
--
that
all
employers
are
under
a
legal
obligation
to
comply
with.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
i
will
say
the
same.
i
was
about
to
say
much
the
same.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
but,
it
is
the
same
as
is
a
rule
established
by
adjudication,
which
is
much
the
same
as
that
of
one
established
by
rule
making.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
were
this
an
amendment
of
a
rule,
mr.
justice,
it
might
be
more
difficult.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
there
is
the
decision
of
this
court
which
involves
that,
to
which
i
will
refer
later.
this
is
the
establishment
of
a
way
of
dealing
with
election
representation
cases
as
a
result
of
the
board's
experience
which,
in
our
view,
was
appropriately
adjudicatory
in
nature.
the
national
labor
relations
board
--
national
labor
relations
act
gives
the
board
broad
powers
to
administer
the
act
and
we
know
from
the
chenery
case
of
more
than
20
years
ago
that
such
powers
are
to
be
construed
broadly,
that
they
can
be
exercised
by
decisions
of
the
administrative
agency
reached
in
adjudicatory
proceedings.
it's
true
that
the
decision
in
the
chenery
case
was
applicable
to
that
case.
indeed,
that
was
part
of
the
problem
there
and
was
not
prospective
only,
but
there
is
much
in
this
court's
opinion
in
the
chenery
case
which
would
suggest
the
result
for
which
we
contend
here.
there
was,
here,
an
actual
controversy
in
the
excelsior
case.
there
was
a
hearing,
as
required
by
section
9
(c)
(1)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
there
was
extensive
briefing
in
oral
argument
and
a
full
reasoned
opinion
by
the
board.
in
its
opinion,
the
board
reached
a
conclusion
as
to
the
appropriate
rule
of
decision
for
such
cases,
but
then
held,
because
of
considerations
of
fairness
to
the
parties
then
before
it,
that
that
rule
should
be
applied
only
to
subsequent
cases.
we
submit
that
the
board
in
the
excelsior
case
was
engaged
in
adjudication
and
that
the
result
which
it
reached
in
determining
that
controversy
was
validly
arrived
at
in
the
process
of
adjudication.
it
was
a
real
case.
there
was
no
faint
issue,
no
effort
by
the
board
to
make
rules
simply
because
it
thought
that
would
be
a
good
idea.
the
matter
was
handled
in
an
adjudicatory
proceeding
with
all
the
care
and
safeguards
required
for
the
appropriate
consideration
and
resolution
of
a
case.
out
of
that
consideration,
the
board
came
to
a
conclusion
which
it
announced
as
its
decision
with
careful
reasoning
to
support
it.
the
decision
represented
a
departure,
as
decisions
often
do,
and
the
board
concluded
that
the
solution
it
reached
should
be
applied
prospectively
only.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
as
to
the
national
labor
relations
board,
i
am
not
aware
of
any
other
thing
like
it.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
but
there
are
many
courts.
there
may
be
administrative
agencies.
i
don't
know.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
mr.
justice,
i
do
not
know
of
anything
either
in
the
labor
board
or
in
other
administrative
agencies.
nevertheless,
in
determining
what
is
adjudication,
it
seems
to
me,
not
inappropriate
to
look
to
what
courts
do.
and,
decisions
which
are
prospective
only
in
their
operation
have
been
known
in
this
court
at
least
as
far
back
as
the
sunburst
oil
and
refining
case
in
287
us,
some-35
years
ago.
in
recent
years,
this
court
has
frequently
decided
that
certain
decisions
should
and
can
be
applied
prospectively
only
and
no
one
has
opposed
that
the
court
was
not
adjudicating,
not
acting
as
a
court,
when
it
did
so.
several
of
these
cases
are
cited
on
pages
22
and
23
of
this
brief,
i
haven't
had
a
chance
to
study
the
opinions,
but
allen
against
the
state
board
of
elections
decided
this
morning
appears
to
be
another
one.
and,
perhaps
the
cases
closest
to
the
present
situation
are
england
against
the
louisiana
state
board
of
medical
examiners
in
375
us
and
james
against
the
united
states
in
366
us.
in
both
of
which,
this
court
announced
rules
in
the
james
case
overruling
an
earlier
case
in
the
england
case,
clarifying
a
situation
which
was
uncertain
as
somewhat
as
in
the
excelsior
case.
and,
in
each
case,
the
court,
for
one
reason
or
another,
reasons
of
fairness
to
the
parties
in
the
particular
case,
announced
that
the
rule
would
not
be
applied
in
this
case.
in
the
england
case,
this
court's
words
were
“on
the
record
in
the
instant
case,
the
rule
we
announce
today
would
call
for
affirmance
of
the
district
court's
judgment,
but
we
are
unwilling
to
apply
the
rule
against
these
appellants.”
no
one
has
ever
contended
that,
in
the
england
case
or
in
the
james
case,
that
the
court
was
engaged
in
rule
making.
on
the
contrary,
in
both
cases,
this
court
was
acting
as
a
court.
it
was
deciding
the
cases
hen
before
it
and
articulating
the
somewhat
complicated
reason
which
led
it
to
the
conclusion
which
it
then
reached.
neither
the
england
case
nor
the
james
case
is
dealt
within
the
respondent's
brief
here.
i
should
point
out,
however,
that
the
respondent
cites
one
case
in
his
brief
which
is
not
dealt
with
in
ours
and
which
points
the
other
way.
this
is
on
page
13
of
the
respondent's
brief.
it
is
a
per
curiam
decision
of
this
court
in
chicago
&
north
western
railway
company
against
chicago,
burlington
&
quincy
railroad
company
where
this
court
affirmed
a
judgment
of
a
district
court
dismissing
an
effort
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission
to
enforce
an
order
because,
in
that
case,
the
interstate
commerce
commission
had
made
an
order
far
broader
than
the
matters
before
the
commission.
indeed,
the
commissioner's
hearing
examiner
had
said
that
these
matters
are
not
involved
in
this
case
and
no
consideration
has
been
given
to
them.
when
the
matter
went
to
the
commission,
the
commission
issued
a
broad
order
applicable
not
only
to
the
case,
but
to
the
whole
field.
now,
the
district
court
refused
to
enforce
an
order
based
on
that,
and
this
court
affirmed
it
per
curiam.
on
the
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
i
think
not,
mr.
justice.
i
think
that
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
it
was
in
--
the
other
parties
then
sued
to
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
to
prevent
the
enforcement
of
the
rule
and
future
applications.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and,
this
court
summarily
held
that
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
issue
is
the
same,
but
i
think
the
factual
situation
is
distinguished.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no.
well,
i
think
it's
distinguishable
from
this,
in
that,
there,
the
interstate
commerce
commission
went
beyond
this
case
and
decided
a
broad
general
proposition,
as
to
which
there
had
been
no
hearing
of
any
sort.
indeed,
the
hearing
examiner
had
announced
that
the
broad
issue
was
not
involved
in
the
case.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice.
i
don'
think
the
federal
register
act
has
anything
to
do
with
it
that
it
hasn't
been
relied
upon
by
the
respondents.
one
has
to
look
to
many
things
besides
the
--
what's
in
the
federal
register
to
learn
what
the
law
is,
including
the
decisions
of
this
court.
moreover,
the
federal
register
act
expressly
provides
that
its
rule
that
an
unpublished
regulation
is
not
binding,
is
not
applicable
to
a
person
who
has
actual
notice
of
the
rule.
and,
there
isn't
any
doubt
that
wyman-gordon
had
actual
notice
of
this
rule
and
deliberately
chose
not
to
comply
with.
so,
i
don't
think
the
federal
register
act
has
anything
to
do
with
it.
the
problem
of
how
you
find
out
what
the
law
is,
i
suppose,
is
the
lawyer's
problem
and
i
would
suggest
anybody
involved
in
a
labor
case
should
look
to
the
decisions
as
well
as
to
the
rules
because,
for
better
or
for
worse,
the
national
labor
relations
board
has
never
proceeded
in
the
rule
making
basis
and
there
is
no
material
in
the
federal
register
on
this.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
there
was
a
slight
explanation
last
fall
in
a
statement
made
to
congress
in
which
they
said
that
they
thought
they
would
sometime
as
far
as
i
know,
they
haven't
yet.
i
can
understand
why
it
is
the
nature
of
their
area
is
delicate
and
difficult
and
evolving
and
things
don't
formulate
in
rule
fashion
the
way
they
do
in
the
treasury
system
where
it's
fairly
easy
to
make
rules.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
but,
justice,
they
do
have
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
they
do
that
by
press
release.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
i
don't
understand
at
all,
i
can
say,
is
that
that's
not
involved
in
this
case.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and,
perhaps
i'm
glad.
there
are
other
contentions.
[laughter]
there
are
other
contentions
in
the
case
which
are
dealt
with
in
our
brief,
and
my
time
has
expired
so
i'll
have
to
leave
them
to
that.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
chief
justice,
may
i
make
a
correction
in
one
of
my
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
interest
to
a
question.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
was
asked
whether
there
were
other
instances
where
the
labor
board
or
other
agencies
had
made
prospective
determinations
in
adjudicatory
proceedings,
and
i
said
i
was
unaware
of
them.
this
was
a
clear
slip.
on
page
14
of
our
brief
in
footnote
11,
there
are
listed
several
other
instances
both
involving
the
board
and
involving
other
agencies.
this
is
not
a
unique
situation.
