mr.
quentin
o.
young
i
would
please
the
court.
i
apologize
for
my
voice
today,
but
i've
had
laryngitis
or
something
for
the
last
week
and
i
can't
speak
very
well.
i
would
like
to
direct
myself
to
a
question
that
you
asked,
mr.
justice,
of
the
solicitor
general
as
to
why
the
board
does
not
use
the
rule
making
powers.
i
think
one
of
the
reasons
is
explicit
here
because
they
developed
the
excelsior
rule
in
a
fashion
and
in
a
manner
which
it
was
not
directly
subject
to
court
review
either
by
the
excelsior
company
or
by
any
other
company
in
the
country
that
was
involved
in
the
various
excelsior
cases.
the
solicitor
general
has
indicated
that
the
wyman-gordon
co.
refused,
refused,
and
refused
as
though
we
were
doing
something
illegal
and
not
complying
with
the
board's
excelsior
rule.
actually,
we
were
doing
the
only
thing
which
we
could
do
in
order
to
test
the
excelsior
rule
because
of
the
way
that
the
board
had
promulgated
it.
i
think
that
the
administrative
procedure
act
and
the
national
labor
relations
act
make
it
very
clear
that
the
board
should
and
must
follow
the
administrative
procedure
act
in
promulgating
its
rules,
even
though
it
is
arbitrarily
for
the
last
30-odd
years,
refused
to
follow
this
position.
you
asked
the
question
as
to
whether
an
attorney
representing
a
client
could
look
to
the
federal
register
and
find
out
what
the
board's
rules
were
or
whether
he
could
--
it
would
be
necessary
for
him
to
go
into
the
cases.
well,
actually,
i
have
found
over
the
course
of
the
years
that
when
i
advice
a
client
on
friday
what
he
can
do
under
the
national
labor
relations
act,
i
must
also
advice
him
that,
on
monday
morning,
i
may
change
my
opinion
and
tell
him
what
he
could
do
on
friday
he
couldn't
do
on
monday.
i
think
that
the
board,
and
now
i'm
getting
away
from
my
argument,
the
board
should
be
required
to
follow
the
administrative
procedure
act
because
it
is
the
duty
of
the
board
to
stabilize
labor
relations
in
this
nation.
and,
actually,
what
they
have
done
by
proceeding
on
an
ad
hoc
basis,
they
have
unstabilized
labor
relations.
the
point
that
lawyers
advice
their
client
at
their
peril,
and
i
think
that
if
the
board
were
to
make
extensive
use
of
their
rule
making
power,
all
of
this
confusion
would
be
--
mr.
quentin
o.
young
pardon?
mr.
quentin
o.
young
i
didn't
--
i'm
sorry?
mr.
quentin
o.
young
well,
that
order,
if
you
call
it
that,
sir,
came
out
--
mr.
quentin
o.
young
well,
it
was
in
effect,
but
it
w
--
when
the
board
sends
notice
that
a
petition
for
an
election
has
been
filed,
it
also
sends
a
notification
in
regard
the
excelsior
list.
so
that,
the
only
way
we
could
contest
excelsior
is
by
refusing
to
give
the
excelsior
list
to
the
board.
mr.
quentin
o.
young
we
had
no
other
means
--
mr.
quentin
o.
young
i
would
say
we
would
have
to
do
it
that
--
exactly
that.
i
would
like
to
get
back
here
in
my
argument.
in
section
6,
the
national
labor
relations
board
is
specifically
directed
to
use
--
to
make,
from
time
to
time,
amend
and
rescind
in
the
manner
prescribed
by
the
administrative
procedure
act,
such
rules
and
regulations
as
maybe
necessary
to
carry
out
the
provisions
of
this
subcontract.
this
is
what
we
contend
the
board
did
in
excelsior
and
it
has
not
followed
the
rule
established
in
the
administrative
procedure
act
in
section
4
and
5,
whereby
all
agency's
rules
and
regulations
of
a
general
policy
nature
must
be
published
and
a
hearing
held
in
accordance
with
the
pos
--
provisions
of
the
administrative
procedure
act.
i
think
of
what
--
of
most
importance
--
mr.
quentin
o.
young
no,
it
is
not
my
position,
but
it's
my
position
that
this
is
a
rule
of
the
nature
that
should've
been
published
in
a
proc
--
following
the
procedure
--
the
administrative
procedure
act.
mr.
quentin
o.
young
i
recognize
the
fact
that
the
agency
has
a
right
to
make
rules
in
an
adjudicatory
fashion
and
in
a
quasi-legislative
fashion.
mr.
quentin
o.
young
well,
i
--
it's
our
contention
--
mr.
quentin
o.
young
it's
our
contention
that
it
is
improper
adjudicatory
deci
--
rule
making
here
because
they
decided
case
one
way
between
excelsior
and
the
board.
they
said
as
far
as
excelsior
is
concerned
--
mr.
quentin
o.
young
well,
they
hadn't
made
no
decision
as
such.
the
board
hasn't
made
any
decision
against
me.
mr.
quentin
o.
young
because
they
haven't
--
i
refuse
to
give
them
the
list
where
the
sole
purpose
is
to
turn
around
and
hand
it
to
the
units.
mr.
quentin
o.
young
then
the
board
filed
a
subpoena.
mr.
quentin
o.
young
issued
a
subpoena.
mr.
quentin
o.
young
the
district
court
upheld
the
subpoena
and
the
circuit
--
mr.
quentin
o.
young
that's
correct.
mr.
quentin
o.
young
no.
mr.
quentin
o.
young
if
the
subpoena
is
valid,
i
have
to
give
up
the
list,
but
i
--
mr.
quentin
o.
young
we
claim
that
the
excelsior
rule
is
invalid,
that
the
list
is
not
subject
to
subpoena
powers
of
the
district
court
because
it
is
not
evidence
and
it
is
not
to
be
used
to
resolve
any
investigation.
mr.
quentin
o.
young
it
would
be
the
same
whether
excelsior
existed
or
not,
but
it
is
my
further
contention
--
mr.
quentin
o.
young
pardon?
mr.
quentin
o.
young
well,
the
subpoena
was
issued
on
the
basis
of
the
rule.
mr.
quentin
o.
young
no,
sir.
the
way
the
board's
order
reads
it
is
based
solely
upon
excelsior
and
they
have
proceeded
to
seek
the
subpoenas
on
the
basis
of
excelsior,
that
the
list
constitutes
evidence.
and,
it's
our
contention
that
the
lists
are
no
evidence
and
are
not
subject
to
the
subpoena
powers
of
the
district
courts.
mr.
quentin
o.
young
they
could've
done
that,
but
they
did
not.
mr.
quentin
o.
young
i
agree
that
they
possibly
could've
done
it
and
we
would've
had
a
trial
--
mr.
quentin
o.
young
we
would
have
had
to
follow
the
same
procedure
in
order
to
contest
it.
i
think
one
of
the
most
important
things
here
is
that,
as
cited
by
the
solicitor
general
and
in
--
set
forth
in
our
brief,
on
april
2
in
1965,
and
this
is
a
quote
--
a
direct
quote
from
the
excelsior
decision,
the
board
decided
“these
two
cases
presented
a
question
of
substantial
importance
in
the
administration
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
now,
if
they
can
make
a
statement
like
that
in
their
own
decision,
i
don't
see
how
they
can
avoid
the
rule
making
requirements
of
section
6.
the
board,
in
effect,
in
inviting
certain
parties
to
file
briefs,
were
--
was
giving
lip
service
to
the
administrative
procedure
act,
but
i
think
it's
interesting
to
review
the
invitees
who
were
asked
to
participate
as
amici
in
the
excelsior
decision.
the
board
invited,
as
interested
parties,
the
chamber
of
commerce,
the
united
states,
the
afl-cio,
the
iue,
the
national
association
of
manufacturers,
retail
clerks,
textile
workers
union,
and
the
teamsters
union.
i
submit,
even
on
the
basis
of
the
interested
parties
that
the
board
invited
to
file
amicus
briefs
that
the
courts
were
stacked
against
the
employers.
the
board,
in
its
brief
on
page
15,
argues
that
it
is
impractical
for
the
board
to
follow
the
administrative
procedure
act
because
such
a
procedure
is
too
rigid
and
too
flexible
--
too
inflexible
for
it
to
proceed
in
industrial
relations
field.
actually,
this
statement
in
the
board's
brief
on
page
15
is
a
gross
misstatement
of
the
law
because
the
law,
under
section
6,
has
specific
and
explicit
authority
to
make
any
rule
at
any
regulation
that
it
wishes.
the
argument
that
the
apa
procedure
is
too
inflexible
just
will
not
stand
up
under
scrutiny
of
section
6
of
the
act.
the
board
has
placed
a
great
deal
of
emphasis
in
its
brief
in
its
argument
on
the
chenery
case,
but
it
is
this
exact
case
that
judge
aldrich
in
the
first
circuit
found
distinguishable
and,
upon
which,
he
was
able
to
strike
down
the
excelsior
rule.
the
excel
--
the
chenery
case
was
a
decision
between
an
agency
and
an
individual
group.
it
applied
--
the
decision
was
applicable
to
that
group
and
to
that
case
and
also
for
future
operation.
excelsior,
however,
the
board
decided
the
case
in
one
way
in
an
adjudicatory
proceeding
and
then
used
that
as
a
vehicle
for
announcing
an
absolutely
free
and
new
rule
which
had
never
been
applied
in
any
of
the
nlrb
election
procedures.
mr.
quentin
o.
young
i
would've
had
a
very
much
more
difficult
time
in
arguing
the
case,
sir.
mr.
quentin
o.
young
well,
i
think
that
anything
that
is
of
the
general
purpose
effects
the
policy
of
the
administrative
agency
that
is
involved
should
be
using
rule
making
powers
rather
than
adjudicatory
powers
because
this
stabilizes,
at
the
state
of
law,
the
individual
practitioners.
and,
if
all
agencies
were
to
follow
it,
we
would
have
at
least
not
--
30-day
notice
if
there's
going
to
be
a
change
in
the
law
and
we
could
accommodate
ourselves
to
it.
this
way,
we
have
to
read
the
morning
--
monday
morning
papers
to
know
what
the
board
has
done
on
friday.
this
is
one
of
the
pleas
that
i'm
making
here
that
is
collateral
to
the
actual
wyman-gordon
case.
mr.
quentin
o.
young
well,
it's
not
quite
that
broad,
sir.
mr.
quentin
o.
young
yes,
sir.
mr.
quentin
o.
young
pardon?
mr.
quentin
o.
young
we're
not
claiming
lack
of
notice
in
his
particular
case
because
we
did
have
notice,
but
we're
--
what
i'm
claiming
that
if
we
had
the
orderly
use
of
the
administrative
procedure
act,
practitioners
in
this
field
would
have
a
great
deal
of
more
stabilized
area
in
which
to
operate.
mr.
quentin
o.
young
in
some
slight
instances
where
there
has
been
a
mistake
--
an
innocent
mistake,
let
us
say,
or
in
case
--
mr.
quentin
o.
young
no,
they
have
overlooked
it.
i
mean,
what
i'm
saying
“innocent
mistake,”
several
names
were
misspelled,
several
addresses
were
incorrect
and
then,
again,
they
do
not
apply
it
under
section
7
in
the
construction
industry
where
you
can
have
a
very
early
election.
mr.
quentin
o.
young
isn't
what
notice?
mr.
quentin
o.
young
yes.
mr.
quentin
o.
young
this
is
correct.
mr.
quentin
o.
young
my
complaint
is
that
they
had
no
authority
under
the
act
to
issue
this
rule,
and
they
did
it
in
an
illegal
manner.
mr.
quentin
o.
young
yes,
sir.
mr.
quentin
o.
young
no.
well,
i
think
that
where
they
decide
a
case
one
way
in
regard
to
the
party,
here
excelsior,
and
then
they
used
that
as
a
vehicle
to
set
down
a
rule
--
mr.
quentin
o.
young
no,
sir.
i
think
we
should
have
--
no,
sir
--
mr.
quentin
o.
young
i
think,
under
the
terms
of
the
administrative
procedure
act,
i
think
we
have
the
right
to
be
heard
before
a
rule
become
effective
under
apa.
mr.
quentin
o.
young
this
is
after
the
facts,
sir.
mr.
quentin
o.
young
no,
sir.
mr.
quentin
o.
young
pardon?
mr.
quentin
o.
young
it's
after
the
fact
of
excelsior
is
what
i
meant.
mr.
quentin
o.
young
that's
correct.
mr.
quentin
o.
young
unless
you
say
i
have
to.
mr.
quentin
o.
young
well,
i'd
like
the
decision
in
my
favor
though.
mr.
quentin
o.
young
in
discussing
their
failure
to
follow
the
administrative
procedure
act,
the
board
said
at
page
27
of
their
brief,
it
is
extremely
unlikely
that
it
would've
obtained
more
enlightenment
on
the
problem
if
it
had
followed
the
administrative
procedure
act.
i
think
this
is
a
complete
misstatement
of
their
obligations
under
the
act
to
congress.
congress
has
directed
the
board
in
section
6
to
establish
rules
and
to
amend
rules
and
to
rescind
rules
through
the
use
of
the
administrative
procedure
act
and,
yet,
the
board
arbitrarily,
over
the
years,
has
taken
no
notice
of
its
obligations
under
section
6.
the
board
again
tries
to
say
that
there
was
no
disadvantage
to
excelsior
because
of
the
application
of
the
rule
to
the
future
rather
than
to
the
past,
but
it
is
our
argument
here
that
all
other
employers
who
have
to
participate
in
an
excelsior
rule
are
at
a
disadvantage
because
the
only
way
excelsior
can
be
challenged
is
by
the
means
that
we
have
adopted
here.
i
think
i'd
like
to
get
back
to
excelsior
itself
and
the
purposes
of
it,
the
board
claims
that
the
purpose
of
excelsior
is
two-fold.
one
is
to
approve
--
improve
communications
between
unions
and
employees
who
may
be
prospective
union
members,
and
to
im
--
minimize
the
challenges
that
may
follow
board-conducted
election.
but,
i
think
this
is
a
false
statement.
mr.
quentin
o.
young
i'd
like
to
discuss
briefly
the
excelsior
decision
itself
and
what
it
purports
to
do
and,
in
effect,
what
it
does.
the
board
states
that
there's
a
two-fold
purpose
in
deciding
excelsior.
one
is
to
improve
communications
between
union
business
agents
and
perspective
union
members
and,
two,
it
is
to
minimize
challenges
to
voters
after
an
election
has
been
held.
and
yet,
when
you
analyze
it,
the
board
has
adopted
what
i
consider
per
se
rule
here
and
says
that
only
in
this
manner
can
unions
properly
inform
the
electric
of
the
issues
involved.
and
yet,
the
board,
in
holding
to
excelsior,
has
refused
to
admit
any
other
means
of
communication.
in
one
case
which
is
currently
pending
petition
for
certiorari
in
teledyne,
the
board
refused
to
permit
the
mailing
of
notices
or
solicitations
by
an
in
--
disinterested
third
party.
in
teledyne,
for
example,
at
first,
teledyne
corporation
stated
that
there
would
be
no
prohibition
for
solicitation
of
union
membership
in
the
plant
and
in
working
--
unworking
time.
the
board
refused
to
accept
this
as
sufficient
form
of
communication.
teledyne
then
offered
to
send
each
employee
the
stamped
envelope
addressed
to
the
regional
director
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
an
telling
the
regional
director
that
he
had
the
right
to
give
his
name
and
address
to
the
unions.
finally,
teledyne
offered
to
the
use
of
the
american
arbitration
association,
offered
at
its
own
expense,
teledyne's
expense
to
mail
to
the
union
any
communications
that
the
unions
wished.
none
of
these
were
sufficient
for
the
board.
i
think
that
their
argument
that
this
is
to
favor
communications
is
not
exactly
truthful.
i
think
what
they're
actually
trying
to
do
is
to
encourage
union
business
agents,
union
officials
to
visit
these
employees
in
their
homes,
and
this
is
the
sole
reason
why
they're
doing
it
and
yet,
at
the
same
time,
it
has
long
been
established
that
if
an
employer,
during
an
election
campaign,
visits
the
employee's
home
to
discuss
union
matters
with
him,
automatically
commits
an
unfair
labor
practice.
i
think
this
dual
standard
strikes
at
the
heart
of
the
excelsior
decision
itself.
mr.
quentin
o.
young
no,
i'm
saying
that
--
mr.
quentin
o.
young
this
is
an
extension
of
the
law
beyond
anything
that
this
court
has
ever
upheld.
it
permits
and
encourages
visitation
in
the
homes
by
union
organizers
and
this
court,
in
--
mr.
quentin
o.
young
i
don't
think
it's
necessary
to
the
act
or
if
you
going
to
permit
the
union
organizers
into
the
homes,
then
i
think
you
ought
to
permit
the
employers
into
the
homes.
i
think
it
constitutes
dual
standard.
the
second
basis
of
--
mr.
quentin
o.
young
pardon,
sir?
mr.
quentin
o.
young
the
excelsior
rule
permits
union
men
to
visit
the
homes
by
a
long
series
of
cases,
other
cases.
it
has
been
held
that
if
employer
does
the
same
thing,
this
goes
back
well
before
excelsior,
that
if
employer
visits
a
home
for
the
purpose
of
discussing
union
activities
in
their
union
organization,
it
is
an
automatic
per
se
unfair
labor
practice.
the
second
purpose
that
the
board
has
stated
was
the
justification
of
excelsior
is
that
it
minimizes
and
reduces
challenges
to
voters
after
an
election.
i
think
the
facts
in
our
wyman-gordon
case
--
mr.
quentin
o.
young
i
can't
cite
you
the
specific
case,
but
i
know
that
there's
never
been
a
case
that
says
the
union
organizer
cannot
visit
the
homes.
i
think
that
the
fallacy
of
listening
of
challenges
by
the
use
of
the
excelsior
list
is
clearly
demonstrated
in
our
brief
at
page
4
where,
of
approximately
1,750
voters,
there
are
exactly
six
challenges.
now,
i
don't
know
how
many
--
what
percentage
figure
that
works
out
t,
but
it
certainly
indicates
that
challenges
had
no
real
place
in
the
wyman-gordon
election
in
1966.
further,
i
have
analyzed
the
30th
annual
report
of
the
labor
board
which
is
from
the
count
for
the
fiscal
year
1965
and
the
annual
report
for
fiscal
year
1967.
these
are
the
years
--
full
year
prior
to
excelsior
and
the
full
year
after
excelsior.
in
1965,
there
were
7
--
some-7,776
elections.
in
its
annual
report,
they
have
a
table
11
which
has
listed
the
cha
--
cases
in
which
challenges
have
been
involved.
they
list
under
the
heading
of
“challenges
only.”
there
are
312
elections
out
of
the
7,000
involving
challenges.
thus,
only
4.01%
out
of
all
the
election
cases
held,
the
year
prior
to
excelsior,
involved
challenges.
turning
then
to
the
sixth
32nd
annual
report,
it
shows
that
in
the
fiscal
year
1967
8,116
elections
were
held.
in
table
11,
it
indicates
under
“challenges
only”
that
there
were
371
elections
in
which
challenges
were
held,
this
results
in
a
4.5%
of
the
--
cases
of
the
elections
held
by
the
board
in
fiscal
1957
involving
challenges.
the
improvement
factor
after
the
excelsior
requirement
was
put
into
effect.
it's
a
-56
--
-0.56%.
so,
the
board
by
its
own
records
clearly
shows
that
the
excelsior
rule
has
no
bearing
whatsoever
on
minimizing
challenges
after
the
election.
another
thing
that
i
would
like
to
point
out
is
that
this
per
se
rule
applies
to
all
elections,
and
i
can
see
no
justification
of
the
application
of
excelsior
rule
in
elections
with
two,
three,
four,
and
five
people
involved
in
the
unit.
i'd
like
briefly
to
go
forward
and
--
mr.
quentin
o.
young
well,
the
board
requires
that
you
may
not
have
an
election,
except
when
you
comply
with
excelsior.
this
is
one
of
my
complaints
about
it.
there's
no
need
for
it.
mr.
quentin
o.
young
of
course,
they
are.
mr.
quentin
o.
young
but,
this
is
a
rule.
mr.
quentin
o.
young
they
can
find
out.
mr.
quentin
o.
young
we
have,
in
the
city
of
wister
greater
--
city
of
wister,
directory
which
lists
all
employees
in
the
greater
wister
area
showing
that
they
are
employees
of
wyman-gordon.
this,
i
have
suggested
as
an
alternate
means
for
the
union
contacting
anybody
who
wants
to
find
out
wyman-gordon
employees
can
go
to
the
wister
public
library
and
get
the
wister
directory
and
they'll
find
every
one
of
our
employee's
name
therein.
mr.
quentin
o.
young
on
my
recollection,
it's
once
every
two
years.
mr.
quentin
o.
young
yes.
mr.
quentin
o.
young
we
have
a
relatively
minor
turnover.
mr.
quentin
o.
young
some
of
them,
yes,
indeed.
mr.
quentin
o.
young
but,
we
are
the
biggest
employer
in
wister
area
and
we
have
a
relatively
small
--
mr.
quentin
o.
young
i'd
like
to
turn
now
to
the
question
of
whether
this
list
constitutes
evidence,
and
i
believe
that
they
do
not.
the
purpose
of
this
list
is
solely
for
the
board
to
take
the
list
in
one
hand
and
then
hand
it
right
over
to
the
union.
it
is
not
used
to
prove
anything.
it
is
not
used
to
disprove
anything.
i
submit
that,
under
the
ordinary
definition
of
evidence,
the
excelsior
list
do
not
--
does
not
come
within
that
--
those
terms.
in
actual
practice,
the
board
requests
the
list
when
everything
has
been
done
in
an
election
proceeding,
except
the
actual
voting
itself,
so
that
there's
no
evidentiary
matter
that
is
under
investigation.
there's
no
question
open,
other
than
the
final
results
of
the
election.
i
think
that
the
excelsior
list
does
not
come
within
the
common
accepted
definition
of
what
evidence
is.
corpus
jurors
of
31
cjs
evidence
is
a
demonstration
of
a
fact
that
signifies
that
which
demonstrates,
makes
clear,
ascertains
the
truth
of
the
point
--
truth
of
a
factor
appointing
issue,
either
on
one
side
or
another.
in
legal
acceptant,
the
term
“evidence”
includes
all
the
means
by
which
any
alleged
matter
of
fact,
the
truth
of
which,
is
submitted
to
investigation
is
established
or
disproved.
i
don't
see
how
anybody
can
hold
that
taking
a
list
of
employees
and
turning
them
over
without
even
looking
at
it,
insofar
as
the
board
is
concerned,
constitutes
evidence.
it
is
submitted
--
mr.
quentin
o.
young
well,
i
think
it
greatly
enhances
the
union's
right
to
approach
employees,
and
i
don't
think
that
this
is
--
mr.
quentin
o.
young
this
is
my
contention
because
i
think
that
violates
the
right
of
privacy.
i
don't
think
any
employer
--
mr.
quentin
o.
young
pardon?
mr.
quentin
o.
young
the
right
of
privacy
of
the
employees.
i
don't
think
it
has
--
mr.
quentin
o.
young
pardon?
mr.
quentin
o.
young
i
do,
indeed.
i
think
this
is
an
invasion
of
the
employee's
right
of
privacy
and
i
have
covered
this
in
my
brief.
i
don't
think
any
employer
should
have
the
right
to
give
a
list
of
names
and
addresses
of
his
employees
to
anybody
outside
the
federal
government
and
for
their
purposes,
but
not
to
be
turned
over
to
an
outside
agency.
mr.
quentin
o.
young
we
do
not
give
our
employee's
names.
they
obtain
--
mr.
quentin
o.
young
i
do
not
know,
but
it's
r.l.
polk
company
from
cleveland
or
cincinnati
that
puts
it
out.
i
know
that
much,
but
i
don't
know
how
they
obtain
them.
they
don't
obtain
them
from
the
company
because
the
company
has
had
a
long
policy
of
not
giving
the
names
and
addresses.
mr.
quentin
o.
young
support
what?
mr.
quentin
o.
young
well,
i
think
that
is
an
assistance
to
the
union
on
--
in
a
violation
in
section
8
(a)
(2)
and
of
a
violation
of
section
302
in
regard
to
giving
a
thing
of
value
to
the
board
that
can
be
turned
over
to
the
unions.
further,
one
last
idea,
i
don't
think
that
if
you
compare
the
language
of
section
11
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
and
the
language
of
the
railway
labor
act,
giving
the
board
authority
to
investigate,
you
will
find
that
there's
any
authority
for
the
labor
board
to
obtain
these
lists
and
turn
them
over
to
the
union.
in
the
railway
labor
act,
the
board
is
powered
--
empowered
to
issue
subpoenas
for
such
information
as
may
be
deemed
necessary
by
it
to
carry
out
the
purposes
of
the
act.
no
such
authority
is
granted
to
the
labor
board
in
the
national
labor
relations
act.
mr.
quentin
o.
young
i
would
please
the
court.
i
apologize
for
my
voice
today,
but
i've
had
laryngitis
or
something
for
the
last
week
and
i
can't
speak
very
well.
i
would
like
to
direct
myself
to
a
question
that
you
asked,
mr.
justice,
of
the
solicitor
general
as
to
why
the
board
does
not
use
the
rule
making
powers.
i
think
one
of
the
reasons
is
explicit
here
because
they
developed
the
excelsior
rule
in
a
fashion
and
in
a
manner
which
it
was
not
directly
subject
to
court
review
either
by
the
excelsior
company
or
by
any
other
company
in
the
country
that
was
involved
in
the
various
excelsior
cases.
the
solicitor
general
has
indicated
that
the
wyman-gordon
co.
refused,
refused,
and
refused
as
though
we
were
doing
something
illegal
and
not
complying
with
the
board's
excelsior
rule.
actually,
we
were
doing
the
only
thing
which
we
could
do
in
order
to
test
the
excelsior
rule
because
of
the
way
that
the
board
had
promulgated
it.
i
think
that
the
administrative
procedure
act
and
the
national
labor
relations
act
make
it
very
clear
that
the
board
should
and
must
follow
the
administrative
procedure
act
in
promulgating
its
rules,
even
though
it
is
arbitrarily
for
the
last
30-odd
years,
refused
to
follow
this
position.
you
asked
the
question
as
to
whether
an
attorney
representing
a
client
could
look
to
the
federal
register
and
find
out
what
the
board's
rules
were
or
whether
he
could
--
it
would
be
necessary
for
him
to
go
into
the
cases.
well,
actually,
i
have
found
over
the
course
of
the
years
that
when
i
advice
a
client
on
friday
what
he
can
do
under
the
national
labor
relations
act,
i
must
also
advice
him
that,
on
monday
morning,
i
may
change
my
opinion
and
tell
him
what
he
could
do
on
friday
he
couldn't
do
on
monday.
i
think
that
the
board,
and
now
i'm
getting
away
from
my
argument,
the
board
should
be
required
to
follow
the
administrative
procedure
act
because
it
is
the
duty
of
the
board
to
stabilize
labor
relations
in
this
nation.
and,
actually,
what
they
have
done
by
proceeding
on
an
ad
hoc
basis,
they
have
unstabilized
labor
relations.
the
point
that
lawyers
advice
their
client
at
their
peril,
and
i
think
that
if
the
board
were
to
make
extensive
use
of
their
rule
making
power,
all
of
this
confusion
would
be
--
mr.
quentin
o.
young
pardon?
mr.
quentin
o.
young
i
didn't
--
i'm
sorry?
mr.
quentin
o.
young
well,
that
order,
if
you
call
it
that,
sir,
came
out
--
mr.
quentin
o.
young
well,
it
was
in
effect,
but
it
w
--
when
the
board
sends
notice
that
a
petition
for
an
election
has
been
filed,
it
also
sends
a
notification
in
regard
the
excelsior
list.
so
that,
the
only
way
we
could
contest
excelsior
is
by
refusing
to
give
the
excelsior
list
to
the
board.
mr.
quentin
o.
young
we
had
no
other
means
--
mr.
quentin
o.
young
i
would
say
we
would
have
to
do
it
that
--
exactly
that.
i
would
like
to
get
back
here
in
my
argument.
in
section
6,
the
national
labor
relations
board
is
specifically
directed
to
use
--
to
make,
from
time
to
time,
amend
and
rescind
in
the
manner
prescribed
by
the
administrative
procedure
act,
such
rules
and
regulations
as
maybe
necessary
to
carry
out
the
provisions
of
this
subcontract.
this
is
what
we
contend
the
board
did
in
excelsior
and
it
has
not
followed
the
rule
established
in
the
administrative
procedure
act
in
section
4
and
5,
whereby
all
agency's
rules
and
regulations
of
a
general
policy
nature
must
be
published
and
a
hearing
held
in
accordance
with
the
pos
--
provisions
of
the
administrative
procedure
act.
i
think
of
what
--
of
most
importance
--
mr.
quentin
o.
young
no,
it
is
not
my
position,
but
it's
my
position
that
this
is
a
rule
of
the
nature
that
should've
been
published
in
a
proc
--
following
the
procedure
--
the
administrative
procedure
act.
mr.
quentin
o.
young
i
recognize
the
fact
that
the
agency
has
a
right
to
make
rules
in
an
adjudicatory
fashion
and
in
a
quasi-legislative
fashion.
mr.
quentin
o.
young
well,
i
--
it's
our
contention
--
mr.
quentin
o.
young
it's
our
contention
that
it
is
improper
adjudicatory
deci
--
rule
making
here
because
they
decided
case
one
way
between
excelsior
and
the
board.
they
said
as
far
as
excelsior
is
concerned
--
mr.
quentin
o.
young
well,
they
hadn't
made
no
decision
as
such.
the
board
hasn't
made
any
decision
against
me.
mr.
quentin
o.
young
because
they
haven't
--
i
refuse
to
give
them
the
list
where
the
sole
purpose
is
to
turn
around
and
hand
it
to
the
units.
mr.
quentin
o.
young
then
the
board
filed
a
subpoena.
mr.
quentin
o.
young
issued
a
subpoena.
mr.
quentin
o.
young
the
district
court
upheld
the
subpoena
and
the
circuit
--
mr.
quentin
o.
young
that's
correct.
mr.
quentin
o.
young
no.
mr.
quentin
o.
young
if
the
subpoena
is
valid,
i
have
to
give
up
the
list,
but
i
--
mr.
quentin
o.
young
we
claim
that
the
excelsior
rule
is
invalid,
that
the
list
is
not
subject
to
subpoena
powers
of
the
district
court
because
it
is
not
evidence
and
it
is
not
to
be
used
to
resolve
any
investigation.
mr.
quentin
o.
young
it
would
be
the
same
whether
excelsior
existed
or
not,
but
it
is
my
further
contention
--
mr.
quentin
o.
young
pardon?
mr.
quentin
o.
young
well,
the
subpoena
was
issued
on
the
basis
of
the
rule.
mr.
quentin
o.
young
no,
sir.
the
way
the
board's
order
reads
it
is
based
solely
upon
excelsior
and
they
have
proceeded
to
seek
the
subpoenas
on
the
basis
of
excelsior,
that
the
list
constitutes
evidence.
and,
it's
our
contention
that
the
lists
are
no
evidence
and
are
not
subject
to
the
subpoena
powers
of
the
district
courts.
mr.
quentin
o.
young
they
could've
done
that,
but
they
did
not.
mr.
quentin
o.
young
i
agree
that
they
possibly
could've
done
it
and
we
would've
had
a
trial
--
mr.
quentin
o.
young
we
would
have
had
to
follow
the
same
procedure
in
order
to
contest
it.
i
think
one
of
the
most
important
things
here
is
that,
as
cited
by
the
solicitor
general
and
in
--
set
forth
in
our
brief,
on
april
2
in
1965,
and
this
is
a
quote
--
a
direct
quote
from
the
excelsior
decision,
the
board
decided
“these
two
cases
presented
a
question
of
substantial
importance
in
the
administration
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
now,
if
they
can
make
a
statement
like
that
in
their
own
decision,
i
don't
see
how
they
can
avoid
the
rule
making
requirements
of
section
6.
the
board,
in
effect,
in
inviting
certain
parties
to
file
briefs,
were
--
was
giving
lip
service
to
the
administrative
procedure
act,
but
i
think
it's
interesting
to
review
the
invitees
who
were
asked
to
participate
as
amici
in
the
excelsior
decision.
the
board
invited,
as
interested
parties,
the
chamber
of
commerce,
the
united
states,
the
afl-cio,
the
iue,
the
national
association
of
manufacturers,
retail
clerks,
textile
workers
union,
and
the
teamsters
union.
i
submit,
even
on
the
basis
of
the
interested
parties
that
the
board
invited
to
file
amicus
briefs
that
the
courts
were
stacked
against
the
employers.
the
board,
in
its
brief
on
page
15,
argues
that
it
is
impractical
for
the
board
to
follow
the
administrative
procedure
act
because
such
a
procedure
is
too
rigid
and
too
flexible
--
too
inflexible
for
it
to
proceed
in
industrial
relations
field.
actually,
this
statement
in
the
board's
brief
on
page
15
is
a
gross
misstatement
of
the
law
because
the
law,
under
section
6,
has
specific
and
explicit
authority
to
make
any
rule
at
any
regulation
that
it
wishes.
the
argument
that
the
apa
procedure
is
too
inflexible
just
will
not
stand
up
under
scrutiny
of
section
6
of
the
act.
the
board
has
placed
a
great
deal
of
emphasis
in
its
brief
in
its
argument
on
the
chenery
case,
but
it
is
this
exact
case
that
judge
aldrich
in
the
first
circuit
found
distinguishable
and,
upon
which,
he
was
able
to
strike
down
the
excelsior
rule.
the
excel
--
the
chenery
case
was
a
decision
between
an
agency
and
an
individual
group.
it
applied
--
the
decision
was
applicable
to
that
group
and
to
that
case
and
also
for
future
operation.
excelsior,
however,
the
board
decided
the
case
in
one
way
in
an
adjudicatory
proceeding
and
then
used
that
as
a
vehicle
for
announcing
an
absolutely
free
and
new
rule
which
had
never
been
applied
in
any
of
the
nlrb
election
procedures.
mr.
quentin
o.
young
i
would've
had
a
very
much
more
difficult
time
in
arguing
the
case,
sir.
mr.
quentin
o.
young
well,
i
think
that
anything
that
is
of
the
general
purpose
effects
the
policy
of
the
administrative
agency
that
is
involved
should
be
using
rule
making
powers
rather
than
adjudicatory
powers
because
this
stabilizes,
at
the
state
of
law,
the
individual
practitioners.
and,
if
all
agencies
were
to
follow
it,
we
would
have
at
least
not
--
30-day
notice
if
there's
going
to
be
a
change
in
the
law
and
we
could
accommodate
ourselves
to
it.
this
way,
we
have
to
read
the
morning
--
monday
morning
papers
to
know
what
the
board
has
done
on
friday.
this
is
one
of
the
pleas
that
i'm
making
here
that
is
collateral
to
the
actual
wyman-gordon
case.
mr.
quentin
o.
young
well,
it's
not
quite
that
broad,
sir.
mr.
quentin
o.
young
yes,
sir.
mr.
quentin
o.
young
pardon?
mr.
quentin
o.
young
we're
not
claiming
lack
of
notice
in
his
particular
case
because
we
did
have
notice,
but
we're
--
what
i'm
claiming
that
if
we
had
the
orderly
use
of
the
administrative
procedure
act,
practitioners
in
this
field
would
have
a
great
deal
of
more
stabilized
area
in
which
to
operate.
mr.
quentin
o.
young
in
some
slight
instances
where
there
has
been
a
mistake
--
an
innocent
mistake,
let
us
say,
or
in
case
--
mr.
quentin
o.
young
no,
they
have
overlooked
it.
i
mean,
what
i'm
saying
“innocent
mistake,”
several
names
were
misspelled,
several
addresses
were
incorrect
and
then,
again,
they
do
not
apply
it
under
section
7
in
the
construction
industry
where
you
can
have
a
very
early
election.
mr.
quentin
o.
young
isn't
what
notice?
mr.
quentin
o.
young
yes.
mr.
quentin
o.
young
this
is
correct.
mr.
quentin
o.
young
my
complaint
is
that
they
had
no
authority
under
the
act
to
issue
this
rule,
and
they
did
it
in
an
illegal
manner.
mr.
quentin
o.
young
yes,
sir.
mr.
quentin
o.
young
no.
well,
i
think
that
where
they
decide
a
case
one
way
in
regard
to
the
party,
here
excelsior,
and
then
they
used
that
as
a
vehicle
to
set
down
a
rule
--
mr.
quentin
o.
young
no,
sir.
i
think
we
should
have
--
no,
sir
--
mr.
quentin
o.
young
i
think,
under
the
terms
of
the
administrative
procedure
act,
i
think
we
have
the
right
to
be
heard
before
a
rule
become
effective
under
apa.
mr.
quentin
o.
young
this
is
after
the
facts,
sir.
mr.
quentin
o.
young
no,
sir.
mr.
quentin
o.
young
pardon?
mr.
quentin
o.
young
it's
after
the
fact
of
excelsior
is
what
i
meant.
mr.
quentin
o.
young
that's
correct.
mr.
quentin
o.
young
unless
you
say
i
have
to.
mr.
quentin
o.
young
well,
i'd
like
the
decision
in
my
favor
though.
mr.
quentin
o.
young
in
discussing
their
failure
to
follow
the
administrative
procedure
act,
the
board
said
at
page
27
of
their
brief,
it
is
extremely
unlikely
that
it
would've
obtained
more
enlightenment
on
the
problem
if
it
had
followed
the
administrative
procedure
act.
i
think
this
is
a
complete
misstatement
of
their
obligations
under
the
act
to
congress.
congress
has
directed
the
board
in
section
6
to
establish
rules
and
to
amend
rules
and
to
rescind
rules
through
the
use
of
the
administrative
procedure
act
and,
yet,
the
board
arbitrarily,
over
the
years,
has
taken
no
notice
of
its
obligations
under
section
6.
the
board
again
tries
to
say
that
there
was
no
disadvantage
to
excelsior
because
of
the
application
of
the
rule
to
the
future
rather
than
to
the
past,
but
it
is
our
argument
here
that
all
other
employers
who
have
to
participate
in
an
excelsior
rule
are
at
a
disadvantage
because
the
only
way
excelsior
can
be
challenged
is
by
the
means
that
we
have
adopted
here.
i
think
i'd
like
to
get
back
to
excelsior
itself
and
the
purposes
of
it,
the
board
claims
that
the
purpose
of
excelsior
is
two-fold.
one
is
to
approve
--
improve
communications
between
unions
and
employees
who
may
be
prospective
union
members,
and
to
im
--
minimize
the
challenges
that
may
follow
board-conducted
election.
but,
i
think
this
is
a
false
statement.
mr.
quentin
o.
young
i'd
like
to
discuss
briefly
the
excelsior
decision
itself
and
what
it
purports
to
do
and,
in
effect,
what
it
does.
the
board
states
that
there's
a
two-fold
purpose
in
deciding
excelsior.
one
is
to
improve
communications
between
union
business
agents
and
perspective
union
members
and,
two,
it
is
to
minimize
challenges
to
voters
after
an
election
has
been
held.
and
yet,
when
you
analyze
it,
the
board
has
adopted
what
i
consider
per
se
rule
here
and
says
that
only
in
this
manner
can
unions
properly
inform
the
electric
of
the
issues
involved.
and
yet,
the
board,
in
holding
to
excelsior,
has
refused
to
admit
any
other
means
of
communication.
in
one
case
which
is
currently
pending
petition
for
certiorari
in
teledyne,
the
board
refused
to
permit
the
mailing
of
notices
or
solicitations
by
an
in
--
disinterested
third
party.
in
teledyne,
for
example,
at
first,
teledyne
corporation
stated
that
there
would
be
no
prohibition
for
solicitation
of
union
membership
in
the
plant
and
in
working
--
unworking
time.
the
board
refused
to
accept
this
as
sufficient
form
of
communication.
teledyne
then
offered
to
send
each
employee
the
stamped
envelope
addressed
to
the
regional
director
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
an
telling
the
regional
director
that
he
had
the
right
to
give
his
name
and
address
to
the
unions.
finally,
teledyne
offered
to
the
use
of
the
american
arbitration
association,
offered
at
its
own
expense,
teledyne's
expense
to
mail
to
the
union
any
communications
that
the
unions
wished.
none
of
these
were
sufficient
for
the
board.
i
think
that
their
argument
that
this
is
to
favor
communications
is
not
exactly
truthful.
i
think
what
they're
actually
trying
to
do
is
to
encourage
union
business
agents,
union
officials
to
visit
these
employees
in
their
homes,
and
this
is
the
sole
reason
why
they're
doing
it
and
yet,
at
the
same
time,
it
has
long
been
established
that
if
an
employer,
during
an
election
campaign,
visits
the
employee's
home
to
discuss
union
matters
with
him,
automatically
commits
an
unfair
labor
practice.
i
think
this
dual
standard
strikes
at
the
heart
of
the
excelsior
decision
itself.
mr.
quentin
o.
young
no,
i'm
saying
that
--
mr.
quentin
o.
young
this
is
an
extension
of
the
law
beyond
anything
that
this
court
has
ever
upheld.
it
permits
and
encourages
visitation
in
the
homes
by
union
organizers
and
this
court,
in
--
mr.
quentin
o.
young
i
don't
think
it's
necessary
to
the
act
or
if
you
going
to
permit
the
union
organizers
into
the
homes,
then
i
think
you
ought
to
permit
the
employers
into
the
homes.
i
think
it
constitutes
dual
standard.
the
second
basis
of
--
mr.
quentin
o.
young
pardon,
sir?
mr.
quentin
o.
young
the
excelsior
rule
permits
union
men
to
visit
the
homes
by
a
long
series
of
cases,
other
cases.
it
has
been
held
that
if
employer
does
the
same
thing,
this
goes
back
well
before
excelsior,
that
if
employer
visits
a
home
for
the
purpose
of
discussing
union
activities
in
their
union
organization,
it
is
an
automatic
per
se
unfair
labor
practice.
the
second
purpose
that
the
board
has
stated
was
the
justification
of
excelsior
is
that
it
minimizes
and
reduces
challenges
to
voters
after
an
election.
i
think
the
facts
in
our
wyman-gordon
case
--
mr.
quentin
o.
young
i
can't
cite
you
the
specific
case,
but
i
know
that
there's
never
been
a
case
that
says
the
union
organizer
cannot
visit
the
homes.
i
think
that
the
fallacy
of
listening
of
challenges
by
the
use
of
the
excelsior
list
is
clearly
demonstrated
in
our
brief
at
page
4
where,
of
approximately
1,750
voters,
there
are
exactly
six
challenges.
now,
i
don't
know
how
many
--
what
percentage
figure
that
works
out
t,
but
it
certainly
indicates
that
challenges
had
no
real
place
in
the
wyman-gordon
election
in
1966.
further,
i
have
analyzed
the
30th
annual
report
of
the
labor
board
which
is
from
the
count
for
the
fiscal
year
1965
and
the
annual
report
for
fiscal
year
1967.
these
are
the
years
--
full
year
prior
to
excelsior
and
the
full
year
after
excelsior.
in
1965,
there
were
7
--
some-7,776
elections.
in
its
annual
report,
they
have
a
table
11
which
has
listed
the
cha
--
cases
in
which
challenges
have
been
involved.
they
list
under
the
heading
of
“challenges
only.”
there
are
312
elections
out
of
the
7,000
involving
challenges.
thus,
only
4.01%
out
of
all
the
election
cases
held,
the
year
prior
to
excelsior,
involved
challenges.
turning
then
to
the
sixth
32nd
annual
report,
it
shows
that
in
the
fiscal
year
1967
8,116
elections
were
held.
in
table
11,
it
indicates
under
“challenges
only”
that
there
were
371
elections
in
which
challenges
were
held,
this
results
in
a
4.5%
of
the
--
cases
of
the
elections
held
by
the
board
in
fiscal
1957
involving
challenges.
the
improvement
factor
after
the
excelsior
requirement
was
put
into
effect.
it's
a
-56
--
-0.56%.
so,
the
board
by
its
own
records
clearly
shows
that
the
excelsior
rule
has
no
bearing
whatsoever
on
minimizing
challenges
after
the
election.
another
thing
that
i
would
like
to
point
out
is
that
this
per
se
rule
applies
to
all
elections,
and
i
can
see
no
justification
of
the
application
of
excelsior
rule
in
elections
with
two,
three,
four,
and
five
people
involved
in
the
unit.
i'd
like
briefly
to
go
forward
and
--
mr.
quentin
o.
young
well,
the
board
requires
that
you
may
not
have
an
election,
except
when
you
comply
with
excelsior.
this
is
one
of
my
complaints
about
it.
there's
no
need
for
it.
mr.
quentin
o.
young
of
course,
they
are.
mr.
quentin
o.
young
but,
this
is
a
rule.
mr.
quentin
o.
young
they
can
find
out.
mr.
quentin
o.
young
we
have,
in
the
city
of
wister
greater
--
city
of
wister,
directory
which
lists
all
employees
in
the
greater
wister
area
showing
that
they
are
employees
of
wyman-gordon.
this,
i
have
suggested
as
an
alternate
means
for
the
union
contacting
anybody
who
wants
to
find
out
wyman-gordon
employees
can
go
to
the
wister
public
library
and
get
the
wister
directory
and
they'll
find
every
one
of
our
employee's
name
therein.
mr.
quentin
o.
young
on
my
recollection,
it's
once
every
two
years.
mr.
quentin
o.
young
yes.
mr.
quentin
o.
young
we
have
a
relatively
minor
turnover.
mr.
quentin
o.
young
some
of
them,
yes,
indeed.
mr.
quentin
o.
young
but,
we
are
the
biggest
employer
in
wister
area
and
we
have
a
relatively
small
--
mr.
quentin
o.
young
i'd
like
to
turn
now
to
the
question
of
whether
this
list
constitutes
evidence,
and
i
believe
that
they
do
not.
the
purpose
of
this
list
is
solely
for
the
board
to
take
the
list
in
one
hand
and
then
hand
it
right
over
to
the
union.
it
is
not
used
to
prove
anything.
it
is
not
used
to
disprove
anything.
i
submit
that,
under
the
ordinary
definition
of
evidence,
the
excelsior
list
do
not
--
does
not
come
within
that
--
those
terms.
in
actual
practice,
the
board
requests
the
list
when
everything
has
been
done
in
an
election
proceeding,
except
the
actual
voting
itself,
so
that
there's
no
evidentiary
matter
that
is
under
investigation.
there's
no
question
open,
other
than
the
final
results
of
the
election.
i
think
that
the
excelsior
list
does
not
come
within
the
common
accepted
definition
of
what
evidence
is.
corpus
jurors
of
31
cjs
evidence
is
a
demonstration
of
a
fact
that
signifies
that
which
demonstrates,
makes
clear,
ascertains
the
truth
of
the
point
--
truth
of
a
factor
appointing
issue,
either
on
one
side
or
another.
in
legal
acceptant,
the
term
“evidence”
includes
all
the
means
by
which
any
alleged
matter
of
fact,
the
truth
of
which,
is
submitted
to
investigation
is
established
or
disproved.
i
don't
see
how
anybody
can
hold
that
taking
a
list
of
employees
and
turning
them
over
without
even
looking
at
it,
insofar
as
the
board
is
concerned,
constitutes
evidence.
it
is
submitted
--
mr.
quentin
o.
young
well,
i
think
it
greatly
enhances
the
union's
right
to
approach
employees,
and
i
don't
think
that
this
is
--
mr.
quentin
o.
young
this
is
my
contention
because
i
think
that
violates
the
right
of
privacy.
i
don't
think
any
employer
--
mr.
quentin
o.
young
pardon?
mr.
quentin
o.
young
the
right
of
privacy
of
the
employees.
i
don't
think
it
has
--
mr.
quentin
o.
young
pardon?
mr.
quentin
o.
young
i
do,
indeed.
i
think
this
is
an
invasion
of
the
employee's
right
of
privacy
and
i
have
covered
this
in
my
brief.
i
don't
think
any
employer
should
have
the
right
to
give
a
list
of
names
and
addresses
of
his
employees
to
anybody
outside
the
federal
government
and
for
their
purposes,
but
not
to
be
turned
over
to
an
outside
agency.
mr.
quentin
o.
young
we
do
not
give
our
employee's
names.
they
obtain
--
mr.
quentin
o.
young
i
do
not
know,
but
it's
r.l.
polk
company
from
cleveland
or
cincinnati
that
puts
it
out.
i
know
that
much,
but
i
don't
know
how
they
obtain
them.
they
don't
obtain
them
from
the
company
because
the
company
has
had
a
long
policy
of
not
giving
the
names
and
addresses.
mr.
quentin
o.
young
support
what?
mr.
quentin
o.
young
well,
i
think
that
is
an
assistance
to
the
union
on
--
in
a
violation
in
section
8
(a)
(2)
and
of
a
violation
of
section
302
in
regard
to
giving
a
thing
of
value
to
the
board
that
can
be
turned
over
to
the
unions.
further,
one
last
idea,
i
don't
think
that
if
you
compare
the
language
of
section
11
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
and
the
language
of
the
railway
labor
act,
giving
the
board
authority
to
investigate,
you
will
find
that
there's
any
authority
for
the
labor
board
to
obtain
these
lists
and
turn
them
over
to
the
union.
in
the
railway
labor
act,
the
board
is
powered
--
empowered
to
issue
subpoenas
for
such
information
as
may
be
deemed
necessary
by
it
to
carry
out
the
purposes
of
the
act.
no
such
authority
is
granted
to
the
labor
board
in
the
national
labor
relations
act.
