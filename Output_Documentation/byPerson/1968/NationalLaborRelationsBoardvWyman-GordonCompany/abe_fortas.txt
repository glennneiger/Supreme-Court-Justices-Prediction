justice
abe
fortas
mr.
solicitor
general,
in
the
other
cases
involving
the
excelsior
rule,
did
the
question
arise
similarly,
that
is
to
say,
as
a
consequence
of
a
particularized
order
issued
in
the
particular
case?
justice
abe
fortas
there
has
never
been
an
attempt
to
enforce
the
excelsior
rule
as
a
rule,
that
is,
for
example,
by
--
has
the
board
ever
instituted,
let
us
say,
an
unfair
practice
proceeding
by
a
--
for
a
failure
to
comply
with
the
rule,
absent
an
order
in
the
particular
case?
justice
abe
fortas
this
was
never
published
in
the
federal
register,
was
it,
the
excelsior
rule?
justice
abe
fortas
and
on
this,
what
i
would
deem
to
be,
alternative
theory,
you're
not
contending
that
this
is
rule
making
thing?
justice
abe
fortas
and,
do
you
also
contend
that
even
though
it
is
adjudication
and
not
rule
making
that
it
is
self
--
that
it
has
a
self-contained
imperative
in
the
sense
that,
absent
an
order
in
the
particular
case,
an
affected
party
would
have
to
comply
with
this?
justice
abe
fortas
but,
absent
an
order
in
the
particular
case,
you
would
not
contend
that
there's
an
obligation
on
an
affected
company
to
comply
with
it,
would
you?
justice
abe
fortas
i
see.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
then,
you
are
saying
that
the
effect
of
the
excelsior
rule,
even
though
it
was
adjudication,
is
the
same
as
if
it
were
a
rule
--
an
excelsior
rule
making
power?
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
solicitor
general,
is
this
a
unique
situation?
justice
abe
fortas
is
there
anything
else
like
it
in
board
practice?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
is
there
any
other
administrative
agency
that,
so
far
as
you
know,
that
has
done
something
like
this?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
think,
the
problem
might
be
different.
i
just
wondered
if
you
knew
of
anything
where
this
same
kind
of
curious
situation
is
apparent.
justice
abe
fortas
unless
it
would
strike
at
the
theory
of
the
federal
register
act,
wouldn't
it,
and
that
is
to
say
that
here
in
the
federal
register
act
is
a
company
subject
to
the
national
labor
relations
act
if
it
wants
to
find
out
what
the
rules
are
and
consult
the
federal
register
act
and
rely
with
confidence
on
what
appears
there.
surely
you,
as
well
as
i,
remember
the
controversy
that
led
to
that.
and,
here,
what
you're
saying
is
that
they
also
had
to
consult
the
adjudicated
cases,
not
merely
to
find
principles,
but
also
to
find
a
specific
and
detailed
rule
such
as
this
excelsior
rule.
justice
abe
fortas
would
you
--
justice
abe
fortas
an
order
was
issued
against
you
in
this
specific
case.
justice
abe
fortas
i
say,
an
order
was
issued
against
you
in
this
specific
case,
an
order
commanding
you
to
comply
with
the
excelsior
procedures.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
wasn't
it
an
order?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
then
you
--
i
suppose
you
would
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
suppose
you
would
agree
that
you
really
have
to
contest
two
things
here.
one,
you
hope
you
can
contest
the
excelsior
order
as
improper
rule
making,
but
you've
also
got
to
contest
the
order
issue
--
the
validity
of
the
order
issued
in
this
particular
case
even
if
it
had
never
appeared
in
the
excelsior
litigation.
