chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
if
you
--
it's
your
position
that
under
no
circumstances
could
this
deviation
be
legal,
or
is
it
because
of
the
reasons
that
are
assigned
for
it
to
the
manner
in
which
it
is
done
constitute
the
illegality?
chief
justice
earl
warren
regardless
of
the
reasons
for
the
deviations?
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
do
you
stop
on
the
deviation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
then
may
i
ask
you
this
question?
are
you
arguing
to
us
that
the
differential
in
the
population
of
these
districts
is
so
de
minimis
that
it's
of
no
consequence
under
any
circumstances?
or
are
you
saying
to
us
that
the
changes
that
have
been
made
are
justified
because
of
these
things
that
you
are
talking
about
now?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
i
know
but
you
got
to
take
one
or
the
other
position
or
unless
you
want
to
take
both,
i
don't
know.
but
i'd
like
to
know
whether
your
percentages
are
de
minimis
to
the
extent
that
it's
of
no
consequence
what
the
--
what
caused
the
difference.
or
are
you
saying
that
we
justify
these
differences
because
of
these
conditions
that
you
have
just
outlined
to
us.
chief
justice
earl
warren
under
any
circumstances?
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
chief
justice
earl
warren
even
though
25,000
people
have
their
votes
lessened,
and
they
could've
been
given
an
equal
vote
by
having
a
more
contiguous
district
than
you
have
yourself
lined
out.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
isn't
that
then
the
ultimate
question?
and
is
this
other
--
is
it
necessary
for
you
to
justify
what
is
done?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
alright.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
well
that's
what
i
wanted
to
get
clear
in
my
mind.
you
argued
it
both
ways.
you
say
that
it's
de
minimis
and
if
we
don't
agree
with
you,
then
the
reasons
you
have
assigned
for
the
differential
between
these
districts
are
sufficient
to
justify
this
act?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
may
i
ask
this?
assuming
that
we
do
not
agree
with
you
that
the
figures
are
--
that
the
differential
is
de
minimis.
what
justification
is
there
for
having
a
district
of
this
shape
and
size,
rather
than
to
have
a
contiguous
district
that
would
equalize
it?
i'm
looking
at
that
map
now,
number
six,
and
it
looks
to
me
like
that's
a
most
unusual
kind
of
district
in
one
that
would
normally
be
called
a
gerrymandered
district?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
why
do
you
have
to
go
from
one
border
of
your
state
way
over
to
the
middle
of
the
state
in
that
circuitous
way
in
order
to
carve
out
a
district?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
now
for
what
reason?
for
what
reasons
you
say
they're
dealing
with
the
legislature?
what
reason
does
the
legislature
have
for
making
that
district
in
that
irregular
and
noncontiguous
shape?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
you
configure
the
microphone,
please.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
why
shouldn't
this
one
have
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
is
that?
redistricting
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
who
refers
to
it
in
that
sense?
judicially?
chief
justice
earl
warren
not
in
a
favorable
way
though.
chief
justice
earl
warren
just
a
question
i'm
trying
to
get
at.
why
isn't
this
one?
they
must
have
some
reason
for
making
this
--
the
shape
it
is
and
having
it
cover
such
a
great
part
of
your
state?
chief
justice
earl
warren
a
lot
of
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
isn't
that
what
--
isn't
that
what
reynolds
versus
sims
tried
to
avoid?
trading
of
territory
in
order
to
bring
about
unreasonable
distribution
of
the
districts?
chief
justice
earl
warren
could
you
have
maintained
the
integrity
of
counties
here
by
a
change
of
this
district
that
would've
brought
them
more
into
conformity
with
equality?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
it
would
be
equal.
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
have
any
other
military
installations
in
missouri
and
other
parts
of
the
state
than
this
eighth?
chief
justice
earl
warren
have
you
taken
consideration,
in
the
consideration
those
installations
in
this
reapportionment?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
you
did
tell
us
the
legislature
itself,
it
went
strictly
on
party
lines?
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
this
shape,
form
and
size
of
eighth
had
been
made
for
an
incumbent
congressman?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
collins.
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
mind
pointing
out
to
us
the
reasons
that
you
rely
on
in
this
case
for
the
legislature
in
departing
from
equality?
the
legal
reasons.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
i
understand
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
therefore,
you
rely
on
it
regardless
of
equality?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
another
question
whether
it
could
or
not.
the
question
in
my
mind
is
whether
you
are
trying
to
justify
this
act
on
the
grounds
that
it's
the
only
bill
that
the
legislature
would
pass?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
mean
absent
following
the
rules
that
have
been
laid
down
by
this
court
for
reapportionment?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
it
has
said
that
it
could
not
be
unequal
for
certain
reasons,
hasn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
you're
telling
us
that
the
reason
that
you
can
rely
on
that
is
because
it's
a
legislative
function
and
that's
the
only
bill,
they
could
pass
therefore
it
is
all
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
if
it
was
6%?
chief
justice
earl
warren
12?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
understood
they
take
it
under
consideration
in
the
city
of
st.
louis,
for
instance,
the
transitory
population
in
a
great
city
like
that.
did
the
legislature
consider
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
don't
think
there
is
any
transitory
population
in
a
great
city
like
st.
louis?
chief
justice
earl
warren
this
taking
is
after
the
fact
too,
isn't
it?
this
was
all
--
all
came
up
after
the
fact
not
in
the
legislature?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes
but
in
the
legislature,
was
it
argued
that
there
was
a
university
in
the
eighth
district
and
there
was
a
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
well
the
testimony
was
that
what
they
intended.
but
is
there
any
legislative
record
that
we
have
that
shows
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
did
the
courts
agree
that
the
difference
is
in
the
mississippi
were
for
the
same
reasons
that
you
rely
upon
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
the
courts
i
said.
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
there
an
opinion
of
any
kind
in
that
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
well
i
asked
in
whatever
court
it
was.
did
they
do
it
for
the
same
reasons
that
you
assert
here
that
that's
the
only
kind
of
a
bill
that
they
could
get
through
the
legislature?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought
you
did,
and
i
thought
also
that
your
colleague
said
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
achtenberg.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
mr.
--
counsel
i
noticed
that
district
eight
is
13,542
above
the
normal.
and
that
four
is
12,260
below.
that's
almost
equal
one
above
and
the
other
one
below.
now,
how
could
they
without
disturbing
county
lines
take
12,000
thereabouts
from
eight
and
give
it
to
four?
chief
justice
earl
warren
to
which
would
equalize
the
two
districts?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
we
have
--
chief
justice
earl

we'll
