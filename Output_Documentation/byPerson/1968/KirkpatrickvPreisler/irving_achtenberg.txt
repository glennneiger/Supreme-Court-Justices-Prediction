mr.
irving
achtenberg
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
outset,
the
appellees
wish
to
make
it
clear
that
we
do
not
agree
with
the
issue
as
first
stated
in
the
appellant's
jurisdictional
statement
that
what
the
trial
court
held
was
that
the
legislature's
plan
was
bad,
purely
and
simply
because
a
better
plan
could
have
been
or
was
proposed.
we
don't
think
that
that
is
the
rule.
we
don't
think
the
trial
court
held
that
and
we're
not
asking
this
court
to
so
hold.
what
we
think
the
trial
court
said
was
very
simply
and
in
accordance
with
the
prior
decisions
of
this
court
that
upon
the
evidence
before
it,
the
legislature
had
not
developed
and
presented
a
plan
which
approached
practicable
equality
of
population.
and
further
that
that
was
demonstrated
very
simply,
although
in
many
other
ways
but
very
simply
by
the
fact
that
there
were
whole
counties
which
could've
been
transferred
into
the
out
of
balance
districts
and
have
improved
the
balance
of
those
districts.
and
that
furthermore,
the
legislature
in
its
proceedings
and
before
the
court
did
not
give
constitutionally
justifiable
and
rational
grounds
for
their
exceeding
the
reasonable
variation.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
we
think
--
mr.
irving
achtenberg
--
the
test
in
each
case
must
be
that
the
court
must
examine
the
evidence
before
it.
determine
if
there
is
a
plan
which
is
reasonable
which
approximates
practicable
equality
of
population
in
view
of
the
facts
in
that
particular
state.
and
if
it
does
not
do
so
then
the
court
must
decide
if
there
are
justifiable,
constitutionally
justifiable
reasons
for
exceeding
that
boundary.
we're
saying
very
specifically
that
this
court
should
not,
and
we
ask
it
not,
to
set
any
percentage
to
accept
any
doctrine
of
de
minimis
or
to
say
that
the
situation
in
one
state
may
be
applied
on
a
bare
percentage
formula
to
the
situation
in
any
other
state.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
if
the
court
please
i
will
--
if
mr.
justice
black
please,
i
will
refer
to
the
map
which
is
simply
an
enlargement
of
the
map
appearing
on
page
15
of
appellees'
brief,
was
also
before
the
court.
the
only
difference
is
that
the
chief
--
in
the
bc
eighth
congressional
district,
i
have
outlined
in
red
because
it
is
in
the
state
in
the
reproduction.
other
than
that
it
is
identical,
but
i
should
point
out
that
we
do
not
say
that
the
only
--
is
the
eighth
district,
because
five
districts
are
overrepresented
and
five
districts
are
under
represented
in
substantial
degree.
and
we
feel
that
every
district
must
be
considered
in
evaluating
this
problem.
now,
missouri
peculiarly
situated
with
regard
to
the
structuring
of
its
self-governmental
units,
so
that
we
think
that
missouri
could
be
the
shining
example
of
how
congressional
districts
may
be
drawn
with
almost
mathematical
exactness.
i
will
give
the
court
my
reason
for
that.
missouri
beyond
almost
every
state
has
114
counties,
and
the
city
of
st.
louis
which
by
statute
is
in
effect
a
county,
in
other
words,
115
counties
to
be
divided
between
ten
congressional
districts.
we
have
the
two
masses
of
population
density
on
the
west
of
the
state
in
kansas
city,
the
fifth
district
and
on
the
east
of
the
state
in
st.
louis
in
st.
louis
county
the
first,
second
and
third
districts.
those
four
districts
do
not
exceed
the
boundaries
of
one
county.
in
fact
in
each
case,
there
are
portions
of
the
county
left
to
go
into
rural
districts.
we
have
remaining
six
congressional
districts
to
be
divided
among
115
counties
or
mathematically,
we
have
an
average
of
19
county
building
blocks
within
which
to
structure
a
congressional
district.
well,
obviously
the
more
building
blocks
you
have
and
the
smaller
the
building
blocks,
the
easier
it
is
without
crossing
county
lines
to
create
congressional
districts
of
great
exactitude.
now
beyond
that
in
missouri,
the
fact
is
that
there
are
38
counties
of
the
state
or
almost
exactly
1/3
which
have
less
than
10,000
population,
which
means
that
there
is
a
great
flexibility
of
shifting
of
all
counties.
in
fact,
with
regard
to
the
variances
in
this
case,
the
variants
in
the
eighth
district
of
excess
of
over
13,000
population,
that
figure
of
13,000
population
is
more
than
the
population
of
half
of
the
counties
of
missouri
of
each
of
the
lines
counties
of
missouri.
if
you
take
the
total
variance
of
all
about
26,000
--
almost
26,000
that
variance
is
more
than
the
population
of
any
of
95
of
the
115
counties
of
missouri.
in
addition
by
the
map
which
also
appears
in
our
brief
fortuitously
on
the
legislature's
plan,
there
are
small
counties
abutting
the
eighth
district
which
simply
by
a
shifting
of
the
abutting
county.
very
easy,
the
legislature
could've
made
these
changes.
i
should
say
that
--
mr.
irving
achtenberg
this
is
true
of
every
district.
if
we
not
only
could
shift
population
from
the
eighth
to
the
fourth,
which
is
of
course
is
the
one
which
brings
the
greatest
in
overrepresentation,
but
from
the
seventh
to
the
fourth,
from
the
ninth
to
the
sixth,
from
the
eighth
to
the
tenth,
from
the
seventh
to
the
tenth.
and
since
in
the
urban
areas,
the
legislature
did
not
hold
the
county
lines,
but
in
fact
went
to
township
lines,
went
to
ward
lines
and
even
to
precinct
lines.
we
could,
following
the
pattern
of
the
legislature
and
the
legislature
could
have
shifted
from
district
one
into
nine,
which
would
bring
it
up
to
equality
while
if
it
shifted
5,000
to
six
which
would've
have
dropped
if
ever
and
that
difference
--
mr.
irving
achtenberg
yes,
sir.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
with
--
you
can
take
scotland
county
from
district
nine
into
district
six,
which
would
bring
district
six
up
to
5,000
closer
to
equality.
that
would
short
district
nine
down
to
423.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
no,
sir.
that'd
be
shifting
a
--
mr.
irving
achtenberg
that
would
be
shifting
a
full
county
from
district
to
district.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
i
think
that
is
a
consideration
which
this
court
has
accepted.
i
think
it
comes
down
to
the
practicality
of
the
map
drawing.
in
this
case,
we
don't
suggest
that
it's
necessary
to
split
county
lines
in
the
rural
areas.
we
say
only
that
in
the
city
where
the
legislature
has
split
county
lines
completely
down
to
precincts
--
mr.
irving
achtenberg
--
that
we
would
follow
their
plan
--
mr.
irving
achtenberg
i
would
think
so,
yes
sir.
at
least
it
may
be.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
and
we
don't
quarrel
with
the
legislature's
attempt
to
hold
the
county
lines
where
they
could.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
well,
i
--
mr.
irving
achtenberg
i
think
it
is
almost
a
two-headed
gerrymander.
we
don't
--
or
two-headed
salamander,
we
don't
make
an
issue
of
that
point.
we
think
the
testimony
of
the
majority
leaders
of
both
parties
in
both
houses
made
it
clear
that
this
was
what
i
would
call
a
political
gerrymander.
clearly
the
leaders
of
both
parties
were
playing
the
legislative
game,
seeking
to
achieve
their
legislative
purposes.
now
that
--
mr.
irving
achtenberg
they
will
do
it
to
the
extent
that
the
rulings
of
this
court
permit,
but
not
--
mr.
irving
achtenberg
well,
we
think
that
the
whole
plan
is
a
political
error.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
now
i
think
you're
correct
sir.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
i
think
the
fourth
--
mr.
irving
achtenberg
i
think
not
to
arrive
from
the
mathematical
perfection,
but
to
get
within
2,000
you
could
shift
either
howard
county
with
10,859
and
it
abuts
for
--
mr.
irving
achtenberg
--
direct
from
district
four,
or
you
could
reach
almost
the
same
result
by
shifting
morgan
county,
which
again
completely
abuts
the
adjoining
county
with
a
population
of
9,476
which
would
bring
your
variances
in
those
two
cases
to
a
matter
of
a
thousand
or
two,
rather
than
the
range
of
26,000.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
well,
if
the
court
please,
we're
in
this
manner
of
political,
we
have
--
one
can
never
speak
for
why
the
individual
parties
are
there.
but
we're
not
attacking
any
particular
line,
because
if
they
were
republicans
or
if
they
were
democrats
--
mr.
irving
achtenberg
i
think
that
statement
is
correct
and
i
can
certainly
say
that
that
their
attorneys
are
only
proposing
--
are
only
appearing
and
we
appear
of
course
as
appellees.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
to
my
knowledge,
no
sir.
again,
this
is
my
statement
confirmed
by
mr.
preisler
who
is
one
of
the
plaintiffs
and
is
not
in
the
record.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
i
would
agree
with
mr.
justice's
statement
except
that
not
a
little
closer.
they
could've
done
a
lot
better
and
could've
done
so
very
easily.
there
were
before
the
legislature
60
--
mr.
irving
achtenberg
well
we
certainly
have
answers
to
their
discussion
on
votings.
we
first
of
all
of
course
take
the
position
that
this
is
not
de
minimis
situation.
26,000
is
not
the
proper
quorum
or
authority.
it's
the
votes
of
26,000
people,
and
as
i
indicated
substantially
more
than
the
populations
of
most
of
the
counties
of
the
state.
but
beyond
that
we
feel
that
the
motives
involved
here
are
not
justifiable.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
well,
let
me
take
them
one
by
one
with
regard
to
the
position
which
is
not
specifically
articulated
by
the
appellants.
but
generally
so,
they
talked
about
the
justification
of
legislative
interplay.
they
used
the
term
political
compromise.
they
used
the
term
practical
political
problem.
but
of
course,
the
argument
was
that
this
was
the
best
job
that
could've
been
passed
by
the
legislature.
i
think
the
court
pointed
out
that
the
legislature
would
have
to
follow
the
mandate
of
the
court.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
what
we
think
that
that
argument
sir
could
be
used
to
justify
any
denial
of
equal
representation.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
well
we
think
it
is
an
element
of
the
pragmatic
problem
to
be
weighed.
we
don't
think
that
that
--
mr.
irving
achtenberg
well
i
have
to
be
specific.
i
certainly
don't
think
that
seeking
to
create
a
negro
district
or
seeking
to
exclude
negroes,
a
race
or
gerrymander
would
be
acceptable.
we
don't
think
a
political
gerrymander
would
be
acceptable.
i
struggle
with
it
simply
because
to
talk
of
legislative
compromise
tells
me
very
little.
i
really
think
basically
my
position
is
that
the
--
that
it
is
not
an
acceptable
ground.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
i
would
say
no
sir,
because
this
legislature
met
three
times
on
this
vote.
if
the
court
were
to
accept
the
first
act
of
the
legislature,
which
could've
been
justified
by
the
same
basis,
in
other
words
that
this
was
the
best
that
could
get
through.
and
on
the
political
basis,
i
suppose
you
could
say
it
was
then
the
court
would
have
had
to
accept
that
fact.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
well,
i
--
mr.
irving
achtenberg
well,
i
think
that
the
history
of
reapportionment
is,
mr.
justice
black
well
knows,
shows
that
what
happened
after
colegrove
versus
green
was
that
the
legislatures
of
the
several
states
structured
congressional
districts
which
ranged
as
far
as
600,000
from
the
--
one
range
to
the
other.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
and
after
the
--
mr.
irving
achtenberg
i
would
still
not
accept
the
argument
made
of
legislative
practicability
because
this
in
effect
says
that
in
a
state
as
in
missouri
where
one
party
has
the
majority
in
both
houses
it
may
politically
structure
the
district
so
as
to
be
favorable
to
that
party.
and
it
seems
to
me
that's
wrong,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
if
it
exceeds
practicable
population
percentages,
it
is
contrary
to
the
mandate
of
this
court.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
i
believe
so
sir,
yes
sir.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
i
just
count
it,
yes
sir
that
is
correct.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
and
i
believe
florida
which
--
mr.
irving
achtenberg
if
i
might
address
myself
to
that?
mr.
irving
achtenberg
i
don't
quarrel
with
the
percentage
variations.
i
do
quarrel
with
using
percentages
as
a
standard
for
judging
one
state
as
against
another
state.
i
would
like
to
speak
to
that
point.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
well,
mr.
justice
fortas
it
seems
to
me
that
the
burden
does
not
shift
when
we
get
into
this
matter
of
the
weight
of
the
evidence.
i
would
say
that
the
burden
rests
with
the
proponents
to
justify
their
plan.
perhaps,
visibly
or
on
examination
of
simple
figures,
they
might
sustain
the
burden
of
going
forward
and
then
perhaps
we
have
a
burden
which
we
have
assumed
in
this
case.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
of
showing
that
that
they
have
failed
in
that
regard
and
that
they
have
failed
to
justify
what
we
consider
substantial
variances
under
the
peculiar
situation
in
missouri.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
no
sir.
our
--
mr.
irving
achtenberg
to
continue
with
my
answer
to
mr.
justice
fortas's
question.
it's
our
position
that
the
appellant,
the
attorneys
representing
the
state
did
not
meet
the
burden
of
proof
and
we
think,
well
quite
specifically
the
lower
court
so
held.
and
in
both
the
statement,
the
opinion
of
judge
oliver
and
judge
collinson,
they
both
indicated
that
the
burden
of
proof
had
not
been
met
by
the
proponents
of
the
plan.
but
of
course
we
recognize
that
this
court
must
examine
that
and
we
will
continue
to
argue
that
they
have
not.
then
i
would
like
to
continue
somewhat
from
the
map
one
additional
piece
of
evidence
of
the
10
congressional
districts.
one
might
say
quite
clearly
that
the
first
three
in
st.
louis
and
st.
louis
county
which
are
exclusively
urban
and
suburban,
and
five
which
is
kansas
city,
jackson
county
but
exclusively
kansas
city.
three
of
those
four
are
well
over
populated
which
means
of
course
if
they
are
well
under
represented,
three
out
four.
now,
the
eighth
district
has
been
characterized
in
the
appellant's
brief
as
in
the
group
of
predominantly
rural.
but
the
fact
is
of
course
that
it
has
major
cities
and
it
extends
well
into
the
urban
area
of
st.
louis
county.
so
that
we
may
in
effect
consider
it
as
a
mixture
and
for
the
purposes
of
my
argument,
i
would
ignore
it.
this
leads
five
predominantly
rural
congressional
districts,
and
four
of
those
five
are
under
populated
and
therefore
over
represented.
so
we
have
a
classic
reynolds
versus
sims
situation.
we
have
the
rural
areas
strongly
favored
three
out
of
four
over
represented
against
the
urban
areas
under
represented
three
out
of
four.
i
would
like
to
speak
to
the
question
raised
both
in
the
briefs
and
the
arguments
as
to
the
percentage
comparisons
with
the
florida
case,
gong
versus
kirk
and
the
mississippi
case,
connors
versus
johnson.
first
of
all
the
court
will
recall
that
in
both
of
those
cases,
this
court
affirmed
the
lower
court.
there
was
not
the
situation
which
we
have
in
the
instant
case
where
this
court
is
being
asked
to
review
the
weight
of
the
evidence
and
reverse
the
trial
court.
second
of
all
and
although
i
realize
there
is
dispute
between
the
appellants
and
the
appellees
and
between
the
majority
decision
of
the
court
below
and
the
dissenting
opinion,
as
to
what
the
issue
was
before
this
court
in
connors
versus
johnson.
we
still
hold
to
our
position
that
the
only
issue
raised
there
was
the
issue
of
racial
gerrymander.
and
so
this
question
of
as
equal
as
practicable
by
population
really
was
not
presented
to
the
court
and
therefore
the
court
did
not
fully
consider
and
weigh
the
question
of
percentage
variances.
but
more
than
that,
i
think
we
must
go
to
the
concepts
behind
structuring
of
districts
to
see
why
comparisons
between
states
are
little
and
perhaps
no
value.
there
are
various
factors,
the
total
population
of
the
state
the
population
distribution
in
the
state.
are
there
dense
urban
areas?
how
many
dense
urban
areas?
how
are
they
in
relation
to
rural
areas?
the
number
of
counties,
large
or
small
the
size
of
the
counties,
are
they
easily
movable?
the
location
of
the
counties
as
in
the
particular
plan,
are
they
so
located
that
they
may
be
shifted
from
one
district
to
the
other.
in
other
words,
the
total
geographic
relationship
of
thence
large
counties
to
the
rural
sparsely
populated
counties.
now
in
considering
these
factors
as
i
illustrated
before,
missouri
is
an
ideal
situation
where
if
the
extreme
of
having,
or
two
dense
populated
areas
in
two
corners
of
the
state
and
in
the
interim
after
the
state,
we
have
these
115
counties
to
be
divided
roughly
20
to
a
congressional
district.
now
how
does
this
relate?
just
for
illustration,
and
i
do
not
cite
these
examples
to
argue
the
comparisons
specifically
but
two
examples
which
illustrate
why
the
problem
could
well
be
different
in
other
states?
let
us
take
first
new
york.
new
york
with
17
million
population
as
opposed
to
missouri's
four
million.
with
41
congressional
districts
has
only
62
counties.
this
means
as
a
matter
of
actual
fact
in
the
maps
before
this
court
in
the
case
to
follow
that
the
congressional
districts
in
no
case
had
more
than
four
or
five
counties
to
a
district.
so
your
building
blocks
were
large,
and
the
flexibility
was
very
limited.
so
you
might
well
argue
that
the
percentage
is
significant
in
that
state
but
have
no
significance
when
you
discuss
missouri
situation.
the
same
thing
to
a
different
extent
is
true
in
gong
versus
kirk
in
florida.
florida
has
12
congressional
districts,
but
instead
of
missouri
has
a
115
counties,
it
has
67.
and
the
distribution
there
was
such
that
in
six
districts,
only
three
counties
were
involved.
one
district
four
counties,
in
four
districts
it
rose
to
nine
or
ten,
and
in
only
one
district
did
it
rise
to
the
level
of
the
flexibility
of
missouri
which
has
in
that
case
they
consolidated
23
counties.
so
it
seems
to
me
that
we
come
back
to
the
fact
that
percentages
simply
are
not
meaningful.
the
test
should
be
a
good
faith
effort
to
be
the
best
that
can
be
done.
and
we
submit
that
in
missouri,
the
legislature
failed
by
a
long
shot.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
well,
i
certainly
can't
speak
of
specific
knowledge
of
each
of
those
cases.
i
certainly
gather
that
the
courts
reviewed
the
question.
in
no
case
were
those
matters
before
this
court
if
i'm
correct.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
for
the
florida
case
yes.
other
than
that,
i
would
simply
say
that
he
issues
are
different
in
each
case.
the
geographic,
the
geopolitical
arrangements
of
the
states
were
different.
perhaps
there
were
factors.
perhaps
in
some
of
those
cases
justifiable
variations
were
obtained
for
reasons
not
existing
in
the
missouri
situation.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
no,
sir.
i
would
assume
it
does
so
in
it.
i
would
now
like
to
go
to
the
question
raised
by
the
appellants
with
regard
to
the
--
what
they
view
as
the
peculiar
nature
of
the
eighth
congressional
district.
i
would
first
point
out
that
there
was
virtually
no
evidence
before
the
court
that
the
legislature
considered
student
population,
transit
population
or
military
population.
the
only
testimony
was
that
of
two
of
the
representatives
who
stated
that
they
saw
this
as
a
factor.
the
fact
is
there
are
no
statistics
before
this
court.
there
were
no
statistics
before
the
lower
court
of
what
the
situation
is
in
any
other
of
the
nine
congressional
districts.
and
i
would
like
to
speak
to
that
point.
they
speak
of
the
state
university
in
the
eighth,
but
in
the
fourth
the
adjoining
district
at
the
opposite
end
of
the
scale,
there
is
central
missouri
state
college,
a
state
college.
there
are
the
schools
in
kansas
city.
there
are
as
throughout
the
state
of
missouri
numerous
sectarian
colleges.
on
the
question
of
the
military
establishment
of
fort
leonard
wood,
in
the
fourth
district
again
at
the
opposite
end
of
the
scale,
there
is
richard
scabauer,
an
army
base.
there's
whiteman
air
base,
and
again
throughout
the
state,
i
presume
if
there
were
table,
we
would
find
that
there
are
these
situations
in
various
districts
of
the
state.
certainly
in
each
of
the
rural
districts,
there
is
a
state
college.
there
are
--
the
osteopathic
college
in
one
of
the
districts.
there
are
enumerable
with
the
midwestern
tradition
of
small
colleges.
there
are
colleges
throughout
the
state
and
without
a
statistical
analysis
of
this,
it
seems
to
me
it's
completely
without
meaning
to
argue
that
there
was
some
legitimate
consideration
given
to
the
eighth
congressional
district.
it
simply
isn't
so.
the
same
argument,
it
seems
to
me
applies
with
regard
to
the
question
of
population
trends.
we
just
really
don't
know.
first
of
all
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
case.
second
of
all
the
fact
is
i
think
we
don't
know,
the
statistics
are
not
adequate.
they
are
rough.
we
have
some
ideas,
but
where
our
ideas
also
in
the
case
that
there
is
growth
in
the
eighth
and
there
is
growth
throughout
the
state.
comparably
held
that
affects
the
situation,
the
evidence
does
not
exist
in
this
case.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
frankly,
i
can
not
sir.
i
think
jefferson
was.
i'm
not
sure
of
that.
the
gentleman
indicates
that's
correct.
but
i
don't
have
the
line
of
the
district?
mr.
irving
achtenberg
i
think
not.
does
any
other
counsel?
in
257
f.
supp.,
i'm
told
that
it
does
appear.
i
believe
i'm
correct
in
this
however
that
the
neck
or
the
tail
which
extends
into
st.
louis
county
is
a
new
innovation
which
picks
up
substantial
urban
populations
to
throw
into
this
central
missouri
district.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
well,
i
would
certainly
have
to
be
bound
by
the
record
and
by
the
statements
of
the
appellants'
counsel.
the
statistics
before
the
court
indicate
a
favoring
of
the
rural
area
versus
the
city
areas.
it's
testimony
of
counsel
indicates
that
there
were
--
and
i
think
that
the
testimony
of
the
legislators.
when
they
speak
of
legislative
considerations,
there
can
only
be
two
things
they
are
talking
about.
they're
either
talking
about
personal
considerations
keeping
a
particular
representative
or
a
senate
--
a
congressman
within
his
own
district.
or
the
other
alternative
is
favoring
the
district
from
a
political,
from
a
partisan
political
standpoint.
so
when
all
the
legislatures
testified
and
when
the
appellants
argued
about
legislative
compromise,
they're
talking
about
one
or
both
of
these
things.
it
can't
be
anything
else.
they're
not
talking
about
geographic
or
map
drawing
adjustments.
they're
talking
about
the
political
consideration
which
we
feel
are
irrelevant
and
are
not
constitutionally
justifiable
--
mr.
irving
achtenberg
can
somebody
answer
that?
nine
and
one.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
correct.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
if
the
court
please,
it
seems
to
the
appellees'
in
this
matter
that
in
weighing
this
case
there
is
a
consideration
that
should
be
considered.
the
appellants
talk
about
a
flood
of
cases
coming
before
the
court.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
the
flood
must
come,
it
must
flow.
however,
it
is
certainly
debatable
what
causes
the
flood.
we
think
it
may
well
be
that
creating
a
safety
zone,
a
haven
of
refuge
by
establishing
a
de
minimis
or
a
reasonable
figure
will
establish
a
zone
within
which
the
legislature
based
upon
their
past
history,
will
then
seek
to
gain
their
partisan
political
considerations.
as
result
of
which
perhaps
more
cases
will
come
before
this
court,
and
we
think
that
the
court
would
do
well
to
stand
to
its
present
standards
which
is
simply
that
of
approaching
practicable
equality
by
population.
i'd
like
to
summarize
by
quoting
from
reinhold
niebuhr
who
said
“the
vision
of
a
just
society
is
an
impossible
one
which
can
be
approximated
only
by
those
who
do
not
regard
it
as
impossible.”
perhaps
mathematical
equality
may
be
impossible.
but
equality
of
a
voter's
rights
will
only
be
achieved
when
those
charged
with
the
task
seek
equality
and
do
not
view
it
as
impossible.
thank
you.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
outset,
the
appellees
wish
to
make
it
clear
that
we
do
not
agree
with
the
issue
as
first
stated
in
the
appellant's
jurisdictional
statement
that
what
the
trial
court
held
was
that
the
legislature's
plan
was
bad,
purely
and
simply
because
a
better
plan
could
have
been
or
was
proposed.
we
don't
think
that
that
is
the
rule.
we
don't
think
the
trial
court
held
that
and
we're
not
asking
this
court
to
so
hold.
what
we
think
the
trial
court
said
was
very
simply
and
in
accordance
with
the
prior
decisions
of
this
court
that
upon
the
evidence
before
it,
the
legislature
had
not
developed
and
presented
a
plan
which
approached
practicable
equality
of
population.
and
further
that
that
was
demonstrated
very
simply,
although
in
many
other
ways
but
very
simply
by
the
fact
that
there
were
whole
counties
which
could've
been
transferred
into
the
out
of
balance
districts
and
have
improved
the
balance
of
those
districts.
and
that
furthermore,
the
legislature
in
its
proceedings
and
before
the
court
did
not
give
constitutionally
justifiable
and
rational
grounds
for
their
exceeding
the
reasonable
variation.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
we
think
--
mr.
irving
achtenberg
--
the
test
in
each
case
must
be
that
the
court
must
examine
the
evidence
before
it.
determine
if
there
is
a
plan
which
is
reasonable
which
approximates
practicable
equality
of
population
in
view
of
the
facts
in
that
particular
state.
and
if
it
does
not
do
so
then
the
court
must
decide
if
there
are
justifiable,
constitutionally
justifiable
reasons
for
exceeding
that
boundary.
we're
saying
very
specifically
that
this
court
should
not,
and
we
ask
it
not,
to
set
any
percentage
to
accept
any
doctrine
of
de
minimis
or
to
say
that
the
situation
in
one
state
may
be
applied
on
a
bare
percentage
formula
to
the
situation
in
any
other
state.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
if
the
court
please
i
will
--
if
mr.
justice
black
please,
i
will
refer
to
the
map
which
is
simply
an
enlargement
of
the
map
appearing
on
page
15
of
appellees'
brief,
was
also
before
the
court.
the
only
difference
is
that
the
chief
--
in
the
bc
eighth
congressional
district,
i
have
outlined
in
red
because
it
is
in
the
state
in
the
reproduction.
other
than
that
it
is
identical,
but
i
should
point
out
that
we
do
not
say
that
the
only
--
is
the
eighth
district,
because
five
districts
are
overrepresented
and
five
districts
are
under
represented
in
substantial
degree.
and
we
feel
that
every
district
must
be
considered
in
evaluating
this
problem.
now,
missouri
peculiarly
situated
with
regard
to
the
structuring
of
its
self-governmental
units,
so
that
we
think
that
missouri
could
be
the
shining
example
of
how
congressional
districts
may
be
drawn
with
almost
mathematical
exactness.
i
will
give
the
court
my
reason
for
that.
missouri
beyond
almost
every
state
has
114
counties,
and
the
city
of
st.
louis
which
by
statute
is
in
effect
a
county,
in
other
words,
115
counties
to
be
divided
between
ten
congressional
districts.
we
have
the
two
masses
of
population
density
on
the
west
of
the
state
in
kansas
city,
the
fifth
district
and
on
the
east
of
the
state
in
st.
louis
in
st.
louis
county
the
first,
second
and
third
districts.
those
four
districts
do
not
exceed
the
boundaries
of
one
county.
in
fact
in
each
case,
there
are
portions
of
the
county
left
to
go
into
rural
districts.
we
have
remaining
six
congressional
districts
to
be
divided
among
115
counties
or
mathematically,
we
have
an
average
of
19
county
building
blocks
within
which
to
structure
a
congressional
district.
well,
obviously
the
more
building
blocks
you
have
and
the
smaller
the
building
blocks,
the
easier
it
is
without
crossing
county
lines
to
create
congressional
districts
of
great
exactitude.
now
beyond
that
in
missouri,
the
fact
is
that
there
are
38
counties
of
the
state
or
almost
exactly
1/3
which
have
less
than
10,000
population,
which
means
that
there
is
a
great
flexibility
of
shifting
of
all
counties.
in
fact,
with
regard
to
the
variances
in
this
case,
the
variants
in
the
eighth
district
of
excess
of
over
13,000
population,
that
figure
of
13,000
population
is
more
than
the
population
of
half
of
the
counties
of
missouri
of
each
of
the
lines
counties
of
missouri.
if
you
take
the
total
variance
of
all
about
26,000
--
almost
26,000
that
variance
is
more
than
the
population
of
any
of
95
of
the
115
counties
of
missouri.
in
addition
by
the
map
which
also
appears
in
our
brief
fortuitously
on
the
legislature's
plan,
there
are
small
counties
abutting
the
eighth
district
which
simply
by
a
shifting
of
the
abutting
county.
very
easy,
the
legislature
could've
made
these
changes.
i
should
say
that
--
mr.
irving
achtenberg
this
is
true
of
every
district.
if
we
not
only
could
shift
population
from
the
eighth
to
the
fourth,
which
is
of
course
is
the
one
which
brings
the
greatest
in
overrepresentation,
but
from
the
seventh
to
the
fourth,
from
the
ninth
to
the
sixth,
from
the
eighth
to
the
tenth,
from
the
seventh
to
the
tenth.
and
since
in
the
urban
areas,
the
legislature
did
not
hold
the
county
lines,
but
in
fact
went
to
township
lines,
went
to
ward
lines
and
even
to
precinct
lines.
we
could,
following
the
pattern
of
the
legislature
and
the
legislature
could
have
shifted
from
district
one
into
nine,
which
would
bring
it
up
to
equality
while
if
it
shifted
5,000
to
six
which
would've
have
dropped
if
ever
and
that
difference
--
mr.
irving
achtenberg
yes,
sir.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
with
--
you
can
take
scotland
county
from
district
nine
into
district
six,
which
would
bring
district
six
up
to
5,000
closer
to
equality.
that
would
short
district
nine
down
to
423.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
no,
sir.
that'd
be
shifting
a
--
mr.
irving
achtenberg
that
would
be
shifting
a
full
county
from
district
to
district.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
i
think
that
is
a
consideration
which
this
court
has
accepted.
i
think
it
comes
down
to
the
practicality
of
the
map
drawing.
in
this
case,
we
don't
suggest
that
it's
necessary
to
split
county
lines
in
the
rural
areas.
we
say
only
that
in
the
city
where
the
legislature
has
split
county
lines
completely
down
to
precincts
--
mr.
irving
achtenberg
--
that
we
would
follow
their
plan
--
mr.
irving
achtenberg
i
would
think
so,
yes
sir.
at
least
it
may
be.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
and
we
don't
quarrel
with
the
legislature's
attempt
to
hold
the
county
lines
where
they
could.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
well,
i
--
mr.
irving
achtenberg
i
think
it
is
almost
a
two-headed
gerrymander.
we
don't
--
or
two-headed
salamander,
we
don't
make
an
issue
of
that
point.
we
think
the
testimony
of
the
majority
leaders
of
both
parties
in
both
houses
made
it
clear
that
this
was
what
i
would
call
a
political
gerrymander.
clearly
the
leaders
of
both
parties
were
playing
the
legislative
game,
seeking
to
achieve
their
legislative
purposes.
now
that
--
mr.
irving
achtenberg
they
will
do
it
to
the
extent
that
the
rulings
of
this
court
permit,
but
not
--
mr.
irving
achtenberg
well,
we
think
that
the
whole
plan
is
a
political
error.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
now
i
think
you're
correct
sir.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
i
think
the
fourth
--
mr.
irving
achtenberg
i
think
not
to
arrive
from
the
mathematical
perfection,
but
to
get
within
2,000
you
could
shift
either
howard
county
with
10,859
and
it
abuts
for
--
mr.
irving
achtenberg
--
direct
from
district
four,
or
you
could
reach
almost
the
same
result
by
shifting
morgan
county,
which
again
completely
abuts
the
adjoining
county
with
a
population
of
9,476
which
would
bring
your
variances
in
those
two
cases
to
a
matter
of
a
thousand
or
two,
rather
than
the
range
of
26,000.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
well,
if
the
court
please,
we're
in
this
manner
of
political,
we
have
--
one
can
never
speak
for
why
the
individual
parties
are
there.
but
we're
not
attacking
any
particular
line,
because
if
they
were
republicans
or
if
they
were
democrats
--
mr.
irving
achtenberg
i
think
that
statement
is
correct
and
i
can
certainly
say
that
that
their
attorneys
are
only
proposing
--
are
only
appearing
and
we
appear
of
course
as
appellees.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
to
my
knowledge,
no
sir.
again,
this
is
my
statement
confirmed
by
mr.
preisler
who
is
one
of
the
plaintiffs
and
is
not
in
the
record.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
i
would
agree
with
mr.
justice's
statement
except
that
not
a
little
closer.
they
could've
done
a
lot
better
and
could've
done
so
very
easily.
there
were
before
the
legislature
60
--
mr.
irving
achtenberg
well
we
certainly
have
answers
to
their
discussion
on
votings.
we
first
of
all
of
course
take
the
position
that
this
is
not
de
minimis
situation.
26,000
is
not
the
proper
quorum
or
authority.
it's
the
votes
of
26,000
people,
and
as
i
indicated
substantially
more
than
the
populations
of
most
of
the
counties
of
the
state.
but
beyond
that
we
feel
that
the
motives
involved
here
are
not
justifiable.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
well,
let
me
take
them
one
by
one
with
regard
to
the
position
which
is
not
specifically
articulated
by
the
appellants.
but
generally
so,
they
talked
about
the
justification
of
legislative
interplay.
they
used
the
term
political
compromise.
they
used
the
term
practical
political
problem.
but
of
course,
the
argument
was
that
this
was
the
best
job
that
could've
been
passed
by
the
legislature.
i
think
the
court
pointed
out
that
the
legislature
would
have
to
follow
the
mandate
of
the
court.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
what
we
think
that
that
argument
sir
could
be
used
to
justify
any
denial
of
equal
representation.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
well
we
think
it
is
an
element
of
the
pragmatic
problem
to
be
weighed.
we
don't
think
that
that
--
mr.
irving
achtenberg
well
i
have
to
be
specific.
i
certainly
don't
think
that
seeking
to
create
a
negro
district
or
seeking
to
exclude
negroes,
a
race
or
gerrymander
would
be
acceptable.
we
don't
think
a
political
gerrymander
would
be
acceptable.
i
struggle
with
it
simply
because
to
talk
of
legislative
compromise
tells
me
very
little.
i
really
think
basically
my
position
is
that
the
--
that
it
is
not
an
acceptable
ground.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
i
would
say
no
sir,
because
this
legislature
met
three
times
on
this
vote.
if
the
court
were
to
accept
the
first
act
of
the
legislature,
which
could've
been
justified
by
the
same
basis,
in
other
words
that
this
was
the
best
that
could
get
through.
and
on
the
political
basis,
i
suppose
you
could
say
it
was
then
the
court
would
have
had
to
accept
that
fact.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
well,
i
--
mr.
irving
achtenberg
well,
i
think
that
the
history
of
reapportionment
is,
mr.
justice
black
well
knows,
shows
that
what
happened
after
colegrove
versus
green
was
that
the
legislatures
of
the
several
states
structured
congressional
districts
which
ranged
as
far
as
600,000
from
the
--
one
range
to
the
other.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
and
after
the
--
mr.
irving
achtenberg
i
would
still
not
accept
the
argument
made
of
legislative
practicability
because
this
in
effect
says
that
in
a
state
as
in
missouri
where
one
party
has
the
majority
in
both
houses
it
may
politically
structure
the
district
so
as
to
be
favorable
to
that
party.
and
it
seems
to
me
that's
wrong,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
if
it
exceeds
practicable
population
percentages,
it
is
contrary
to
the
mandate
of
this
court.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
i
believe
so
sir,
yes
sir.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
i
just
count
it,
yes
sir
that
is
correct.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
and
i
believe
florida
which
--
mr.
irving
achtenberg
if
i
might
address
myself
to
that?
mr.
irving
achtenberg
i
don't
quarrel
with
the
percentage
variations.
i
do
quarrel
with
using
percentages
as
a
standard
for
judging
one
state
as
against
another
state.
i
would
like
to
speak
to
that
point.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
well,
mr.
justice
fortas
it
seems
to
me
that
the
burden
does
not
shift
when
we
get
into
this
matter
of
the
weight
of
the
evidence.
i
would
say
that
the
burden
rests
with
the
proponents
to
justify
their
plan.
perhaps,
visibly
or
on
examination
of
simple
figures,
they
might
sustain
the
burden
of
going
forward
and
then
perhaps
we
have
a
burden
which
we
have
assumed
in
this
case.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
of
showing
that
that
they
have
failed
in
that
regard
and
that
they
have
failed
to
justify
what
we
consider
substantial
variances
under
the
peculiar
situation
in
missouri.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
no
sir.
our
--
mr.
irving
achtenberg
to
continue
with
my
answer
to
mr.
justice
fortas's
question.
it's
our
position
that
the
appellant,
the
attorneys
representing
the
state
did
not
meet
the
burden
of
proof
and
we
think,
well
quite
specifically
the
lower
court
so
held.
and
in
both
the
statement,
the
opinion
of
judge
oliver
and
judge
collinson,
they
both
indicated
that
the
burden
of
proof
had
not
been
met
by
the
proponents
of
the
plan.
but
of
course
we
recognize
that
this
court
must
examine
that
and
we
will
continue
to
argue
that
they
have
not.
then
i
would
like
to
continue
somewhat
from
the
map
one
additional
piece
of
evidence
of
the
10
congressional
districts.
one
might
say
quite
clearly
that
the
first
three
in
st.
louis
and
st.
louis
county
which
are
exclusively
urban
and
suburban,
and
five
which
is
kansas
city,
jackson
county
but
exclusively
kansas
city.
three
of
those
four
are
well
over
populated
which
means
of
course
if
they
are
well
under
represented,
three
out
four.
now,
the
eighth
district
has
been
characterized
in
the
appellant's
brief
as
in
the
group
of
predominantly
rural.
but
the
fact
is
of
course
that
it
has
major
cities
and
it
extends
well
into
the
urban
area
of
st.
louis
county.
so
that
we
may
in
effect
consider
it
as
a
mixture
and
for
the
purposes
of
my
argument,
i
would
ignore
it.
this
leads
five
predominantly
rural
congressional
districts,
and
four
of
those
five
are
under
populated
and
therefore
over
represented.
so
we
have
a
classic
reynolds
versus
sims
situation.
we
have
the
rural
areas
strongly
favored
three
out
of
four
over
represented
against
the
urban
areas
under
represented
three
out
of
four.
i
would
like
to
speak
to
the
question
raised
both
in
the
briefs
and
the
arguments
as
to
the
percentage
comparisons
with
the
florida
case,
gong
versus
kirk
and
the
mississippi
case,
connors
versus
johnson.
first
of
all
the
court
will
recall
that
in
both
of
those
cases,
this
court
affirmed
the
lower
court.
there
was
not
the
situation
which
we
have
in
the
instant
case
where
this
court
is
being
asked
to
review
the
weight
of
the
evidence
and
reverse
the
trial
court.
second
of
all
and
although
i
realize
there
is
dispute
between
the
appellants
and
the
appellees
and
between
the
majority
decision
of
the
court
below
and
the
dissenting
opinion,
as
to
what
the
issue
was
before
this
court
in
connors
versus
johnson.
we
still
hold
to
our
position
that
the
only
issue
raised
there
was
the
issue
of
racial
gerrymander.
and
so
this
question
of
as
equal
as
practicable
by
population
really
was
not
presented
to
the
court
and
therefore
the
court
did
not
fully
consider
and
weigh
the
question
of
percentage
variances.
but
more
than
that,
i
think
we
must
go
to
the
concepts
behind
structuring
of
districts
to
see
why
comparisons
between
states
are
little
and
perhaps
no
value.
there
are
various
factors,
the
total
population
of
the
state
the
population
distribution
in
the
state.
are
there
dense
urban
areas?
how
many
dense
urban
areas?
how
are
they
in
relation
to
rural
areas?
the
number
of
counties,
large
or
small
the
size
of
the
counties,
are
they
easily
movable?
the
location
of
the
counties
as
in
the
particular
plan,
are
they
so
located
that
they
may
be
shifted
from
one
district
to
the
other.
in
other
words,
the
total
geographic
relationship
of
thence
large
counties
to
the
rural
sparsely
populated
counties.
now
in
considering
these
factors
as
i
illustrated
before,
missouri
is
an
ideal
situation
where
if
the
extreme
of
having,
or
two
dense
populated
areas
in
two
corners
of
the
state
and
in
the
interim
after
the
state,
we
have
these
115
counties
to
be
divided
roughly
20
to
a
congressional
district.
now
how
does
this
relate?
just
for
illustration,
and
i
do
not
cite
these
examples
to
argue
the
comparisons
specifically
but
two
examples
which
illustrate
why
the
problem
could
well
be
different
in
other
states?
let
us
take
first
new
york.
new
york
with
17
million
population
as
opposed
to
missouri's
four
million.
with
41
congressional
districts
has
only
62
counties.
this
means
as
a
matter
of
actual
fact
in
the
maps
before
this
court
in
the
case
to
follow
that
the
congressional
districts
in
no
case
had
more
than
four
or
five
counties
to
a
district.
so
your
building
blocks
were
large,
and
the
flexibility
was
very
limited.
so
you
might
well
argue
that
the
percentage
is
significant
in
that
state
but
have
no
significance
when
you
discuss
missouri
situation.
the
same
thing
to
a
different
extent
is
true
in
gong
versus
kirk
in
florida.
florida
has
12
congressional
districts,
but
instead
of
missouri
has
a
115
counties,
it
has
67.
and
the
distribution
there
was
such
that
in
six
districts,
only
three
counties
were
involved.
one
district
four
counties,
in
four
districts
it
rose
to
nine
or
ten,
and
in
only
one
district
did
it
rise
to
the
level
of
the
flexibility
of
missouri
which
has
in
that
case
they
consolidated
23
counties.
so
it
seems
to
me
that
we
come
back
to
the
fact
that
percentages
simply
are
not
meaningful.
the
test
should
be
a
good
faith
effort
to
be
the
best
that
can
be
done.
and
we
submit
that
in
missouri,
the
legislature
failed
by
a
long
shot.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
well,
i
certainly
can't
speak
of
specific
knowledge
of
each
of
those
cases.
i
certainly
gather
that
the
courts
reviewed
the
question.
in
no
case
were
those
matters
before
this
court
if
i'm
correct.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
for
the
florida
case
yes.
other
than
that,
i
would
simply
say
that
he
issues
are
different
in
each
case.
the
geographic,
the
geopolitical
arrangements
of
the
states
were
different.
perhaps
there
were
factors.
perhaps
in
some
of
those
cases
justifiable
variations
were
obtained
for
reasons
not
existing
in
the
missouri
situation.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
no,
sir.
i
would
assume
it
does
so
in
it.
i
would
now
like
to
go
to
the
question
raised
by
the
appellants
with
regard
to
the
--
what
they
view
as
the
peculiar
nature
of
the
eighth
congressional
district.
i
would
first
point
out
that
there
was
virtually
no
evidence
before
the
court
that
the
legislature
considered
student
population,
transit
population
or
military
population.
the
only
testimony
was
that
of
two
of
the
representatives
who
stated
that
they
saw
this
as
a
factor.
the
fact
is
there
are
no
statistics
before
this
court.
there
were
no
statistics
before
the
lower
court
of
what
the
situation
is
in
any
other
of
the
nine
congressional
districts.
and
i
would
like
to
speak
to
that
point.
they
speak
of
the
state
university
in
the
eighth,
but
in
the
fourth
the
adjoining
district
at
the
opposite
end
of
the
scale,
there
is
central
missouri
state
college,
a
state
college.
there
are
the
schools
in
kansas
city.
there
are
as
throughout
the
state
of
missouri
numerous
sectarian
colleges.
on
the
question
of
the
military
establishment
of
fort
leonard
wood,
in
the
fourth
district
again
at
the
opposite
end
of
the
scale,
there
is
richard
scabauer,
an
army
base.
there's
whiteman
air
base,
and
again
throughout
the
state,
i
presume
if
there
were
table,
we
would
find
that
there
are
these
situations
in
various
districts
of
the
state.
certainly
in
each
of
the
rural
districts,
there
is
a
state
college.
there
are
--
the
osteopathic
college
in
one
of
the
districts.
there
are
enumerable
with
the
midwestern
tradition
of
small
colleges.
there
are
colleges
throughout
the
state
and
without
a
statistical
analysis
of
this,
it
seems
to
me
it's
completely
without
meaning
to
argue
that
there
was
some
legitimate
consideration
given
to
the
eighth
congressional
district.
it
simply
isn't
so.
the
same
argument,
it
seems
to
me
applies
with
regard
to
the
question
of
population
trends.
we
just
really
don't
know.
first
of
all
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
case.
second
of
all
the
fact
is
i
think
we
don't
know,
the
statistics
are
not
adequate.
they
are
rough.
we
have
some
ideas,
but
where
our
ideas
also
in
the
case
that
there
is
growth
in
the
eighth
and
there
is
growth
throughout
the
state.
comparably
held
that
affects
the
situation,
the
evidence
does
not
exist
in
this
case.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
frankly,
i
can
not
sir.
i
think
jefferson
was.
i'm
not
sure
of
that.
the
gentleman
indicates
that's
correct.
but
i
don't
have
the
line
of
the
district?
mr.
irving
achtenberg
i
think
not.
does
any
other
counsel?
in
257
f.
supp.,
i'm
told
that
it
does
appear.
i
believe
i'm
correct
in
this
however
that
the
neck
or
the
tail
which
extends
into
st.
louis
county
is
a
new
innovation
which
picks
up
substantial
urban
populations
to
throw
into
this
central
missouri
district.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
well,
i
would
certainly
have
to
be
bound
by
the
record
and
by
the
statements
of
the
appellants'
counsel.
the
statistics
before
the
court
indicate
a
favoring
of
the
rural
area
versus
the
city
areas.
it's
testimony
of
counsel
indicates
that
there
were
--
and
i
think
that
the
testimony
of
the
legislators.
when
they
speak
of
legislative
considerations,
there
can
only
be
two
things
they
are
talking
about.
they're
either
talking
about
personal
considerations
keeping
a
particular
representative
or
a
senate
--
a
congressman
within
his
own
district.
or
the
other
alternative
is
favoring
the
district
from
a
political,
from
a
partisan
political
standpoint.
so
when
all
the
legislatures
testified
and
when
the
appellants
argued
about
legislative
compromise,
they're
talking
about
one
or
both
of
these
things.
it
can't
be
anything
else.
they're
not
talking
about
geographic
or
map
drawing
adjustments.
they're
talking
about
the
political
consideration
which
we
feel
are
irrelevant
and
are
not
constitutionally
justifiable
--
mr.
irving
achtenberg
can
somebody
answer
that?
nine
and
one.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
correct.
mr.
irving
achtenberg
if
the
court
please,
it
seems
to
the
appellees'
in
this
matter
that
in
weighing
this
case
there
is
a
consideration
that
should
be
considered.
the
appellants
talk
about
a
flood
of
cases
coming
before
the
court.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
the
flood
must
come,
it
must
flow.
however,
it
is
certainly
debatable
what
causes
the
flood.
we
think
it
may
well
be
that
creating
a
safety
zone,
a
haven
of
refuge
by
establishing
a
de
minimis
or
a
reasonable
figure
will
establish
a
zone
within
which
the
legislature
based
upon
their
past
history,
will
then
seek
to
gain
their
partisan
political
considerations.
as
result
of
which
perhaps
more
cases
will
come
before
this
court,
and
we
think
that
the
court
would
do
well
to
stand
to
its
present
standards
which
is
simply
that
of
approaching
practicable
equality
by
population.
i'd
like
to
summarize
by
quoting
from
reinhold
niebuhr
who
said
“the
vision
of
a
just
society
is
an
impossible
one
which
can
be
approximated
only
by
those
who
do
not
regard
it
as
impossible.”
perhaps
mathematical
equality
may
be
impossible.
but
equality
of
a
voter's
rights
will
only
be
achieved
when
those
charged
with
the
task
seek
equality
and
do
not
view
it
as
impossible.
thank
you.
