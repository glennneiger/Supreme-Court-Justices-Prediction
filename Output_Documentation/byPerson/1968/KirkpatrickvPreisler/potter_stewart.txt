it's
your

i
assume
you're
familiar

that
shows
missouri
to
be
the
what?
the
eleventh
best
in

and
i
don't
know

here.
how

have
been

missouri
--
well
i
was
going
to
ask
you,
do
you
quarrel
with
the
accuracy
of
this
--
the
factual
accuracy
of
this
table?
justice

stewart
well,
i
agree
with
you
on
that.
i
did

call
your

again

the

i
notice

that
the

has
been
verified

true
