mr.
david
collins
may
it
please
the
court.
the
disparity
between
the
population
of
the
eighth
district
and
ideal
is
not
25,000,
it's
13,542.
so
the
difference,
i
don't
think
this
25,000
figure
should
be
misunderstood.
the
eighth
district
is
overpopulated
by
only
13,542
people.
and
as
the
statistics
in
the
attorney
general's
brief
comparing
the
voters
in
proportion
to
the
population
show
the
fact
that
fort
leonard
wood
with
approximately
40,000
soldiers
and
the
university
of
missouri
with
approximately
17,000
people
at
columbia,
about
5,000
at
rolla
plus
the
political
workers
at
jefferson
city
most
of
whom
vote
back
home
in
their
home
counties
would
more
than
offset
that.
so
that
if
an
appropriate
adjustment
were
made
for
the
transient
population
in
the
eighth
district,
actually
the
eighth
district
in
terms
of
voters
is
under
populated.
now
in
the
nebraska
case,
eighth
circuit
judge
johnson
made
a
very
interesting
and
i
think
pertinent
comment
about
analyzing
population
figures
in
reapportionment
cases
to
demonstrate
the
extent
to
which
votes
are
diluted.
and
he
pointed
out
that
if
you
add
up
the
actual
population
of
the
overpopulated
districts
and
compare
that
to
what
the
population
should
be,
if
each
of
those
districts
were
ideal,
you
get
the
difference
between
those
figures
is
the
number
of
people
that
those
five
districts
have
in
the
aggregate
that
they
should
not
have.
now
in
missouri,
we
have
five
overpopulated
and
five
under
populated
districts,
if
you
add
up
the
population
of
the
five
overpopulated
districts,
you
get
2,194,000
some
odd
people.
if
all
five
of
those
districts
were
pertinent,
you
would
have
2,159,000.
so
that
what
you
really
have
is
34,680
too
many
people
in
a
total
of
five
districts.
then
as
judge
johnson
pointed
out,
one
congressman
is
supposed
to
represent
ideally
431,000
people.
so
if
one
congressman
equals
431,000
people,
the
34,000
excess
in
the
five
districts
equals
8%
of
one
congressman.
so
that
you
have
in
the
aggregate
in
these
five
districts
all
the
people.
all
the
people
in
the
five
districts
put
together
have
been
cheated
out
of
8%
of
one
congressman.
and
it
follows
of
course
that
in
any
one
district
their
vote
--
the
people
of
the
district
as
a
whole,
their
vote
has
been
diluted
by
1/5
of
8%
of
one
congressman.
mr.
david
collins
well
that
would
almost
be
correct.
it
would
be
very
minimal.
but
it
does
bring
in
to
focus,
your
honor,
that
when
you
have
the
people
of
half
of
the
districts
of
the
state
are
only
overpopulated
by
34,000
people
and
it
takes
431,000
to
elect
one
congressman
or
the
people
to
represent
congressman.
it
points
out
how
minimal
the
deviation
really
is.
mr.
david
collins
alright
sir,
i
will.
first
let
me
say,
your
honor,
before
i
answer
your
question,
i
agree
with
what
mr.
downey
has
said.
i
contend
that
the
deviations
are
so
small
that
the
reasons
make
no
difference.
mr.
david
collins
right,
now
the
reasons
are
these.
this
is
a
legislative
function.
this
court
has
repeatedly
said
that,
it's
a
legislative
function.
to
--
the
legislature
can
only
act
by
the
passage
of
bills
and
you
have
to
have
the
votes
to
pass
the
bills.
it
takes
82
votes
in
the
missouri
house
to
pass.
there's
161
people
so
you
have
to
have
82
votes
to
pass.
this
bill
got
82
votes.
mr.
david
collins
that's
right
your
honor.
i
don't
think
that
you
can
ever
have
an
absent
court
decree.
i
don't
think
you
can
ever
have
the
legislature
passing
a
bill
that
is
any
closer
than
a
deviation
or
the
worst
deviation
where
you
got
over
4,300,000
or
13,000.
mr.
david
collins
well,
i
think
that's
obviously
true
from
the
record,
your
honor
absent
compulsion
from
this
court
or
some
other
federal
court,
that's
true.
mr.
david
collins
no,
i
think
the
rules
have
been
followed.
this
court
has
never
said
that
they
had
to
be
perfect.
this
court
has
said
they
only
have
to
be
as
close
as
is
practicable.
mr.
david
collins
and
it
--
mr.
david
collins
that's
right
and
there's
absolutely
no
indication
in
this
record
that
there's
been
any
reason
quite
was
unequal.
mr.
david
collins
i
don't
think
any
legislature
whether
the
map
looks
like
this
or
whether
it
looks
otherwise
that
you
can
hammer
out
and
get
the
votes
to
pass
a
bill
that's
closer
than
3%
ideal.
i
think
3%
is
about
as
close
as
you
can
expect
in
the
legislative
process.
mr.
david
collins
well
if
it
were
6%,
in
my
judgment
it
would
still
be
good.
mr.
david
collins
i
think
the
cutoff
point
ought
to
be
in
the
area
of
ten.
i
think
when
you
get
to
8,
9
of
10%
then
you
should
look
extremely
close
at
the
motives.
i'm
not
saying
that
one
of
those
couldn't
possibly
be
justified.
but
i
think
that
is
the
area,
the
critical
area
because
of
what
mr.
downey
said
and
mr.
justice
fortas
commented
about
the
census
bureau
acknowledges
a
possibility
of
the
3%
error
in
their
figures.
well
the
eighth
district
here,
if
you
ignore
the
transient
population,
the
fact
is
it's
probably
dead
perfect
or
very
close
to
it.
but
if
you
ignore
the
transient
population
which
i
think
is
a
legitimate
consideration,
and
which
the
undisputed
evidence
in
this
case
was
they
did
consider
that.
and
there
was
absolutely
no
evidence
to
the
contrary.
but
if
you
ignore
that,
the
3%
error
could
be
the
other
way.
it
could
be
down
to
zero.
now,
it's
likewise
true
as
mr.
justice
fortas
pointed
out,
it
could
be
the
wrong
way
and
make
it
up
to
6%.
but
i
don't
see
how
--
you
see
what
the
census
bureau
acknowledges
a
possibility
of
3%
error
in
their
figures
which
they
do,
then
suppose
that
the
figures
were
accurate
and
it
was
dead
perfect.
you
still
might
have
a
3%
error
there.
mr.
david
collins
that's
true.
mr.
david
collins
that's
true,
that's
true.
mr.
david
collins
in
the
fourth
that's
true.
i
don't
know
that
that's
true
in
the
eighth.
i'm
not
aware
of
any
increase
in
the
eighth.
mr.
david
collins
that's
right.
mr.
david
collins
oh
i'm
sure
that's
true.
eighth
is
the
poll
that's
strictly
rural
counties.
and
the
only
thing
that
would
affect
the
eighth
is
the
military
population
or
the
student
population
of
the
university
of
missouri
which
is
located
in
columbia.
mr.
david
collins
well
it
was
about
seven
--
15
to
17
then.
it's
over
20,000
now
at
the
columbia
campus
and
then
the
school
of
minds,
as
we
call
it
down
at
rolla,
missouri
which
is
also
in
the
eighth
district
has
about
5,000
people.
and
then
the
--
students
that
is,
and
then
the
lincoln
university
at
jefferson
city,
i
don't
know
what
the
enrollment
is,
but
about
3,000
people
there.
and
then
you
have
the
state
capitol
at
jefferson
city
which
has
a
large
number
of
people
holding
political
jobs
down
there
who
vote
back
home.
so
when
you
consider
all
of
those
factors
taken
together
as
mr.
justice
white
suggested
earlier,
you
probably
shouldn't
give
100%
which
hasn't
been
done.
but
if
you
gave
100%,
it
may
have
about
50,000
population
difference.
but
all
you've
got
to
do
to
bring
the
eighth
down
to
perfect
is
13,542
people,
and
there's
undoubtedly
of
that
matter.
and
certainly
it
wouldn't
be
unreasonable
upon
the
part
of
the
legislature
to
so
assume
and
the
testimony
was
that
they
did
consider
this
transient
population
in
the
passage
of
this
bill.
mr.
david
collins
there's
no
evidence
in
the
record
your
honor
that
they
did.
mr.
david
collins
well,
talking
about
what
i
think
and
what's
in
the
record
are
two
different
things.
there's
nothing
in
the
record
that
the
legislature
considered
the
chipped
in
the
population
of
st.
louis
city.
there
has
been.
mr.
david
collins
the
testimony
did,
yes
sir.
mr.
david
collins
yes,
sir,
that
was
the
testimony.
mr.
david
collins
the
testimony
by
these
legislative
--
mr.
david
collins
not
other
than
the
testimony,
no
sir.
there
are
no
records
kept
in
the
missouri
legislature
of
the
argument
--
of
the
debates
or
the
proceedings
there.
so
there
is
not
source
for
this
other
than
just
what
you
read
in
the
newspaper
or
what
you
pick
up
by
rumor.
but
there's
no
evidence
for
example,
mr.
justice
black,
there's
no
evidence
in
this
record
concerning
any
consideration
at
all
about
the
election
or
retention
in
office
of
the
congressman.
nor
is
there
any
about
a
republican
versus
a
democrat
or
vice
versa.
nor
is
there
any
evidence
in
this
record
concerning
that
race
or
the
election
of
a
negro
congressman
was
in
anyway
considered.
that's
not
in
this
record
at
all.
mr.
david
collins
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
your
honor.
i'm
not
that
familiar
with
those
census
data.
mr.
david
collins
no,
sir.
mr.
david
collins
simply
a
statement
in
the
attorney
general's
brief
that
i
think
this
is
a
part
of
the
documentary
part
of
the
--
those
booklets.
it's
in
the
stipulation
of
mr.
wood's
statements.
mr.
david
collins
i
don't
know
the
page
number
of
the
appendixes,
your
honor.
i'd
like
to
point
out
a
couple
of
--
mr.
david
collins
yes,
sir.
we'll
do
that.
i'd
like
to
point
out
your
honors
that
the
mississippi
case
was
affirmed
by
this
court.
the
population
deviations
in
the
mississippi
case
are
greater
than
they
are
in
missouri.
so
that
if
this
court
affirms
the
lower
court,
we
will
not
be
permitted
to
do
in
missouri
what
they
have
been
permitted
to
do
and
are
doing
in
mississippi.
now,
i
say
that
that
would
be
--
mr.
david
collins
well,
there's
no
opinion
of
this
court
in
the
mississippi
case.
mr.
david
collins
i'm
sorry
i
don't
understand
you.
mr.
david
collins
in
the
lower
court
mr.
david
collins
no,
i
don't
assert
that
your
honor.
i
have
a
--
mr.
david
collins
well,
i
don't
say
this
is
the
only
kind
of
a
bill
that
you
can
get
through
the
legislature.
i
simply
point
out
that
a
lot
of
bills
were
introduced.
there
were
a
lot
of
trials
made.
there
were
reports
out
of
committees.
there
were
amendments,
and
finally
when
they
got
this
bill
hammered
out,
it
passed
the
house
by
simply
one
vote.
now,
you
get
in,
in
my
judgment,
you
get
into
the
proposition
of
whether
the
narrow
where
you
make
the
confines
within
which
the
legislature
can
act
and
the
more
restrictive
the
rules
announced
by
the
judiciary
become,
and
the
less
freedom
that
the
legislators
have,
the
less
significant
it
becomes
that
we
are
entitled
to
elect
our
legislators
on
a
one
man,
one
vote
basis.
in
other
words,
what
difference
does
it
make
that
my
vote
is
equal
to
mr.
achtenberg's
vote
in
deciding
who
gets
to
go
down
in
jefferson
city?
if
when
he
gets
down
there,
the
courts
are
going
to
tell
him
that
he
can
only
act
within
a
prescribed
area.
now
i
don't
suggest
that
you
shouldn't
enforce
the
constitutional
mandates
of
courts.
but
i
do
point
out
that
when
you
get
it
down
to
a
slice
of
this
thin
so
to
speak,
you
get
to
the
point
where
it's
almost
a
matter
of
announcing
the
results
of
this
computer,
which
is
what
judge
oliver
suggested
in
the
pretrial
conference,
re-asked
the
question
in
mr.
downey
in
the
pretrial
conference
“why
didn't
the
legislature
consult
the
computer
complex
at
the
university
of
missouri?”
mr.
david
collins
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
collins
the
lower
court
opinion
has
never
been
published.
mr.
david
collins
it
has
been.
i
beg
your
pardon?
yes,
sir,
it
is.
mr.
david
collins
no
this
is
--
i
cite
the
case
but
my
brief
doesn't
have
the
citation.
mr.
david
collins
it's
--
the
citation
is
on
page
43
of
the
appellant's
brief.
mr.
david
collins
of
the
appellant,
the
governor
and
the
secretary
of
state
of
missouri.
mr.
justice
black,
i
now
have
the
answer
to
your
question
about
this
3%
error
in
the
population
figures.
it's
--
it
appears
on
--
is
referred
to
on
page
16
of
the
attorney
general

of
the
appellant's

mr.
david
collins
of
the
reply
brief
of
the
attorney
general.
mr.
david
collins
and
it
appears
on
page
53
of
the
appendix
is
the
stipulation
referred
to
there.
page
53
of
the
appendix
and
page
16
of
the
appellant's
reply
brief,
and
--
mr.
david
collins
right.
mr.
david
collins
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
it
would
be.
i
think
that
compactness
and
contiguity
is
a
significant
factor.
population
is
by
far
the
more
important.
but
i
don't
think
they
would
be
at
liberty
just
as
slight
counties
from
very
--
mr.
david
collins
that's
true.
mr.
david
collins
yes
sir.
as
i
understand
it
they've
been
in
that
same
congressional
district
for
good
many
years.
mr.
david
collins
i
think
they
have.
mr.
david
collins
i
may
be
in
error,
your
honor
but
that's
my
thought
of
the
--
that
they
have.
mr.
david
collins
well
i
think
there
is
to
be
an
error,
but
i
think
they've
been
in
that
same
district
for
good
many
years.
mr.
david
collins
particularly,
texas
county.
i
don't
know
how
long
jefferson
county
has
been.
mr.
david
collins
well,
yes
sir.
i
think
they
are.
i
think
that
they
are
not
only
permissible
but
i
think
that
to
at
least
some
extent
they
are
required,
yes
sir.
i
might
point
out
that
there
seems
to
be
a
difference
of
viewpoint
which
has
judge
mathis
says
in
his
dissenting
opinion
is
extremely
significant
in
who
has
the
burden
of
proof
in
this
case?
in
fact
one
of
subdivisions
to
the
appellees'
brief
relates
to
that
matter.
their
position
being
that
this
deviation
is
per
se
bad.
and
they
arrive
at
that
conclusion
by
stating
that
it
is
a
fact
that
this
percentage
of
deviation
is
not
as
near
as
is
practicable.
and
thereby,
they
assume
the
very
thing
that's
in
issue,
and
having
assumed
that
it
is
not
as
nearly
equal
as
is
practicable
they
point
to
the
language
of
a
couple
of
opinions
and
say
that
“we
have
the
burden
of
proof.”
now
we
dispute
that.
we
say
that
per
se,
a
3%
deviation
from
perfect
is
as
near
as
equal
as
is
practicable.
practicable
being
used
to
evaluate
the
legislative
process,
and
consequently
the
burden
of
proof
of
demonstrating
that
it
is
unconstitutional
is
where
that
burden
always
is
and
that's
on
the
people
asserting
unconstitutionality.
mr.
david
collins
thank
you.
mr.
david
collins
may
it
please
the
court.
the
disparity
between
the
population
of
the
eighth
district
and
ideal
is
not
25,000,
it's
13,542.
so
the
difference,
i
don't
think
this
25,000
figure
should
be
misunderstood.
the
eighth
district
is
overpopulated
by
only
13,542
people.
and
as
the
statistics
in
the
attorney
general's
brief
comparing
the
voters
in
proportion
to
the
population
show
the
fact
that
fort
leonard
wood
with
approximately
40,000
soldiers
and
the
university
of
missouri
with
approximately
17,000
people
at
columbia,
about
5,000
at
rolla
plus
the
political
workers
at
jefferson
city
most
of
whom
vote
back
home
in
their
home
counties
would
more
than
offset
that.
so
that
if
an
appropriate
adjustment
were
made
for
the
transient
population
in
the
eighth
district,
actually
the
eighth
district
in
terms
of
voters
is
under
populated.
now
in
the
nebraska
case,
eighth
circuit
judge
johnson
made
a
very
interesting
and
i
think
pertinent
comment
about
analyzing
population
figures
in
reapportionment
cases
to
demonstrate
the
extent
to
which
votes
are
diluted.
and
he
pointed
out
that
if
you
add
up
the
actual
population
of
the
overpopulated
districts
and
compare
that
to
what
the
population
should
be,
if
each
of
those
districts
were
ideal,
you
get
the
difference
between
those
figures
is
the
number
of
people
that
those
five
districts
have
in
the
aggregate
that
they
should
not
have.
now
in
missouri,
we
have
five
overpopulated
and
five
under
populated
districts,
if
you
add
up
the
population
of
the
five
overpopulated
districts,
you
get
2,194,000
some
odd
people.
if
all
five
of
those
districts
were
pertinent,
you
would
have
2,159,000.
so
that
what
you
really
have
is
34,680
too
many
people
in
a
total
of
five
districts.
then
as
judge
johnson
pointed
out,
one
congressman
is
supposed
to
represent
ideally
431,000
people.
so
if
one
congressman
equals
431,000
people,
the
34,000
excess
in
the
five
districts
equals
8%
of
one
congressman.
so
that
you
have
in
the
aggregate
in
these
five
districts
all
the
people.
all
the
people
in
the
five
districts
put
together
have
been
cheated
out
of
8%
of
one
congressman.
and
it
follows
of
course
that
in
any
one
district
their
vote
--
the
people
of
the
district
as
a
whole,
their
vote
has
been
diluted
by
1/5
of
8%
of
one
congressman.
mr.
david
collins
well
that
would
almost
be
correct.
it
would
be
very
minimal.
but
it
does
bring
in
to
focus,
your
honor,
that
when
you
have
the
people
of
half
of
the
districts
of
the
state
are
only
overpopulated
by
34,000
people
and
it
takes
431,000
to
elect
one
congressman
or
the
people
to
represent
congressman.
it
points
out
how
minimal
the
deviation
really
is.
mr.
david
collins
alright
sir,
i
will.
first
let
me
say,
your
honor,
before
i
answer
your
question,
i
agree
with
what
mr.
downey
has
said.
i
contend
that
the
deviations
are
so
small
that
the
reasons
make
no
difference.
mr.
david
collins
right,
now
the
reasons
are
these.
this
is
a
legislative
function.
this
court
has
repeatedly
said
that,
it's
a
legislative
function.
to
--
the
legislature
can
only
act
by
the
passage
of
bills
and
you
have
to
have
the
votes
to
pass
the
bills.
it
takes
82
votes
in
the
missouri
house
to
pass.
there's
161
people
so
you
have
to
have
82
votes
to
pass.
this
bill
got
82
votes.
mr.
david
collins
that's
right
your
honor.
i
don't
think
that
you
can
ever
have
an
absent
court
decree.
i
don't
think
you
can
ever
have
the
legislature
passing
a
bill
that
is
any
closer
than
a
deviation
or
the
worst
deviation
where
you
got
over
4,300,000
or
13,000.
mr.
david
collins
well,
i
think
that's
obviously
true
from
the
record,
your
honor
absent
compulsion
from
this
court
or
some
other
federal
court,
that's
true.
mr.
david
collins
no,
i
think
the
rules
have
been
followed.
this
court
has
never
said
that
they
had
to
be
perfect.
this
court
has
said
they
only
have
to
be
as
close
as
is
practicable.
mr.
david
collins
and
it
--
mr.
david
collins
that's
right
and
there's
absolutely
no
indication
in
this
record
that
there's
been
any
reason
quite
was
unequal.
mr.
david
collins
i
don't
think
any
legislature
whether
the
map
looks
like
this
or
whether
it
looks
otherwise
that
you
can
hammer
out
and
get
the
votes
to
pass
a
bill
that's
closer
than
3%
ideal.
i
think
3%
is
about
as
close
as
you
can
expect
in
the
legislative
process.
mr.
david
collins
well
if
it
were
6%,
in
my
judgment
it
would
still
be
good.
mr.
david
collins
i
think
the
cutoff
point
ought
to
be
in
the
area
of
ten.
i
think
when
you
get
to
8,
9
of
10%
then
you
should
look
extremely
close
at
the
motives.
i'm
not
saying
that
one
of
those
couldn't
possibly
be
justified.
but
i
think
that
is
the
area,
the
critical
area
because
of
what
mr.
downey
said
and
mr.
justice
fortas
commented
about
the
census
bureau
acknowledges
a
possibility
of
the
3%
error
in
their
figures.
well
the
eighth
district
here,
if
you
ignore
the
transient
population,
the
fact
is
it's
probably
dead
perfect
or
very
close
to
it.
but
if
you
ignore
the
transient
population
which
i
think
is
a
legitimate
consideration,
and
which
the
undisputed
evidence
in
this
case
was
they
did
consider
that.
and
there
was
absolutely
no
evidence
to
the
contrary.
but
if
you
ignore
that,
the
3%
error
could
be
the
other
way.
it
could
be
down
to
zero.
now,
it's
likewise
true
as
mr.
justice
fortas
pointed
out,
it
could
be
the
wrong
way
and
make
it
up
to
6%.
but
i
don't
see
how
--
you
see
what
the
census
bureau
acknowledges
a
possibility
of
3%
error
in
their
figures
which
they
do,
then
suppose
that
the
figures
were
accurate
and
it
was
dead
perfect.
you
still
might
have
a
3%
error
there.
mr.
david
collins
that's
true.
mr.
david
collins
that's
true,
that's
true.
mr.
david
collins
in
the
fourth
that's
true.
i
don't
know
that
that's
true
in
the
eighth.
i'm
not
aware
of
any
increase
in
the
eighth.
mr.
david
collins
that's
right.
mr.
david
collins
oh
i'm
sure
that's
true.
eighth
is
the
poll
that's
strictly
rural
counties.
and
the
only
thing
that
would
affect
the
eighth
is
the
military
population
or
the
student
population
of
the
university
of
missouri
which
is
located
in
columbia.
mr.
david
collins
well
it
was
about
seven
--
15
to
17
then.
it's
over
20,000
now
at
the
columbia
campus
and
then
the
school
of
minds,
as
we
call
it
down
at
rolla,
missouri
which
is
also
in
the
eighth
district
has
about
5,000
people.
and
then
the
--
students
that
is,
and
then
the
lincoln
university
at
jefferson
city,
i
don't
know
what
the
enrollment
is,
but
about
3,000
people
there.
and
then
you
have
the
state
capitol
at
jefferson
city
which
has
a
large
number
of
people
holding
political
jobs
down
there
who
vote
back
home.
so
when
you
consider
all
of
those
factors
taken
together
as
mr.
justice
white
suggested
earlier,
you
probably
shouldn't
give
100%
which
hasn't
been
done.
but
if
you
gave
100%,
it
may
have
about
50,000
population
difference.
but
all
you've
got
to
do
to
bring
the
eighth
down
to
perfect
is
13,542
people,
and
there's
undoubtedly
of
that
matter.
and
certainly
it
wouldn't
be
unreasonable
upon
the
part
of
the
legislature
to
so
assume
and
the
testimony
was
that
they
did
consider
this
transient
population
in
the
passage
of
this
bill.
mr.
david
collins
there's
no
evidence
in
the
record
your
honor
that
they
did.
mr.
david
collins
well,
talking
about
what
i
think
and
what's
in
the
record
are
two
different
things.
there's
nothing
in
the
record
that
the
legislature
considered
the
chipped
in
the
population
of
st.
louis
city.
there
has
been.
mr.
david
collins
the
testimony
did,
yes
sir.
mr.
david
collins
yes,
sir,
that
was
the
testimony.
mr.
david
collins
the
testimony
by
these
legislative
--
mr.
david
collins
not
other
than
the
testimony,
no
sir.
there
are
no
records
kept
in
the
missouri
legislature
of
the
argument
--
of
the
debates
or
the
proceedings
there.
so
there
is
not
source
for
this
other
than
just
what
you
read
in
the
newspaper
or
what
you
pick
up
by
rumor.
but
there's
no
evidence
for
example,
mr.
justice
black,
there's
no
evidence
in
this
record
concerning
any
consideration
at
all
about
the
election
or
retention
in
office
of
the
congressman.
nor
is
there
any
about
a
republican
versus
a
democrat
or
vice
versa.
nor
is
there
any
evidence
in
this
record
concerning
that
race
or
the
election
of
a
negro
congressman
was
in
anyway
considered.
that's
not
in
this
record
at
all.
mr.
david
collins
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
your
honor.
i'm
not
that
familiar
with
those
census
data.
mr.
david
collins
no,
sir.
mr.
david
collins
simply
a
statement
in
the
attorney
general's
brief
that
i
think
this
is
a
part
of
the
documentary
part
of
the
--
those
booklets.
it's
in
the
stipulation
of
mr.
wood's
statements.
mr.
david
collins
i
don't
know
the
page
number
of
the
appendixes,
your
honor.
i'd
like
to
point
out
a
couple
of
--
mr.
david
collins
yes,
sir.
we'll
do
that.
i'd
like
to
point
out
your
honors
that
the
mississippi
case
was
affirmed
by
this
court.
the
population
deviations
in
the
mississippi
case
are
greater
than
they
are
in
missouri.
so
that
if
this
court
affirms
the
lower
court,
we
will
not
be
permitted
to
do
in
missouri
what
they
have
been
permitted
to
do
and
are
doing
in
mississippi.
now,
i
say
that
that
would
be
--
mr.
david
collins
well,
there's
no
opinion
of
this
court
in
the
mississippi
case.
mr.
david
collins
i'm
sorry
i
don't
understand
you.
mr.
david
collins
in
the
lower
court
mr.
david
collins
no,
i
don't
assert
that
your
honor.
i
have
a
--
mr.
david
collins
well,
i
don't
say
this
is
the
only
kind
of
a
bill
that
you
can
get
through
the
legislature.
i
simply
point
out
that
a
lot
of
bills
were
introduced.
there
were
a
lot
of
trials
made.
there
were
reports
out
of
committees.
there
were
amendments,
and
finally
when
they
got
this
bill
hammered
out,
it
passed
the
house
by
simply
one
vote.
now,
you
get
in,
in
my
judgment,
you
get
into
the
proposition
of
whether
the
narrow
where
you
make
the
confines
within
which
the
legislature
can
act
and
the
more
restrictive
the
rules
announced
by
the
judiciary
become,
and
the
less
freedom
that
the
legislators
have,
the
less
significant
it
becomes
that
we
are
entitled
to
elect
our
legislators
on
a
one
man,
one
vote
basis.
in
other
words,
what
difference
does
it
make
that
my
vote
is
equal
to
mr.
achtenberg's
vote
in
deciding
who
gets
to
go
down
in
jefferson
city?
if
when
he
gets
down
there,
the
courts
are
going
to
tell
him
that
he
can
only
act
within
a
prescribed
area.
now
i
don't
suggest
that
you
shouldn't
enforce
the
constitutional
mandates
of
courts.
but
i
do
point
out
that
when
you
get
it
down
to
a
slice
of
this
thin
so
to
speak,
you
get
to
the
point
where
it's
almost
a
matter
of
announcing
the
results
of
this
computer,
which
is
what
judge
oliver
suggested
in
the
pretrial
conference,
re-asked
the
question
in
mr.
downey
in
the
pretrial
conference
“why
didn't
the
legislature
consult
the
computer
complex
at
the
university
of
missouri?”
mr.
david
collins
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
collins
the
lower
court
opinion
has
never
been
published.
mr.
david
collins
it
has
been.
i
beg
your
pardon?
yes,
sir,
it
is.
mr.
david
collins
no
this
is
--
i
cite
the
case
but
my
brief
doesn't
have
the
citation.
mr.
david
collins
it's
--
the
citation
is
on
page
43
of
the
appellant's
brief.
mr.
david
collins
of
the
appellant,
the
governor
and
the
secretary
of
state
of
missouri.
mr.
justice
black,
i
now
have
the
answer
to
your
question
about
this
3%
error
in
the
population
figures.
it's
--
it
appears
on
--
is
referred
to
on
page
16
of
the
attorney
general
--
of
the
appellant's
reply

mr.
david
collins
of
the
reply
brief
of
the
attorney
general.
mr.
david
collins
and
it
appears
on
page
53
of
the
appendix
is
the
stipulation
referred
to
there.
page
53
of
the
appendix
and
page
16
of
the
appellant's
reply
brief,
and
--
mr.
david
collins
right.
mr.
david
collins
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
it
would
be.
i
think
that
compactness
and
contiguity
is
a
significant
factor.
population
is
by
far
the
more
important.
but
i
don't
think
they
would
be
at
liberty
just
as
slight
counties
from
very
--
mr.
david
collins
that's
true.
mr.
david
collins
yes
sir.
as
i
understand
it
they've
been
in
that
same
congressional
district
for
good
many
years.
mr.
david
collins
i
think
they
have.
mr.
david
collins
i
may
be
in
error,
your
honor
but
that's
my
thought
of
the
--
that
they
have.
mr.
david
collins
well
i
think
there
is
to
be
an
error,
but
i
think
they've
been
in
that
same
district
for
good
many
years.
mr.
david
collins
particularly,
texas
county.
i
don't
know
how
long
jefferson
county
has
been.
mr.
david
collins
well,
yes
sir.
i
think
they
are.
i
think
that
they
are
not
only
permissible
but
i
think
that
to
at
least
some
extent
they
are
required,
yes
sir.
i
might
point
out
that
there
seems
to
be
a
difference
of
viewpoint
which
has
judge
mathis
says
in
his
dissenting
opinion
is
extremely
significant
in
who
has
the
burden
of
proof
in
this
case?
in
fact
one
of
subdivisions
to
the
appellees'
brief
relates
to
that
matter.
their
position
being
that
this
deviation
is
per
se
bad.
and
they
arrive
at
that
conclusion
by
stating
that
it
is
a
fact
that
this
percentage
of
deviation
is
not
as
near
as
is
practicable.
and
thereby,
they
assume
the
very
thing
that's
in
issue,
and
having
assumed
that
it
is
not
as
nearly
equal
as
is
practicable
they
point
to
the
language
of
a
couple
of
opinions
and
say
that
“we
have
the
burden
of
proof.”
now
we
dispute
that.
we
say
that
per
se,
a
3%
deviation
from
perfect
is
as
near
as
equal
as
is
practicable.
practicable
being
used
to
evaluate
the
legislative
process,
and
consequently
the
burden
of
proof
of
demonstrating
that
it
is
unconstitutional
is
where
that
burden
always
is
and
that's
on
the
people
asserting
unconstitutionality.
mr.
david
collins
thank
you.
