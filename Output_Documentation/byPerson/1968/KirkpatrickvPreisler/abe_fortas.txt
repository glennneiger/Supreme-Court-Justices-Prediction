justice
abe
fortas
in
what
congressional
district
is
pulaski
county?
justice
abe
fortas
but
where
you
have
an
underage
don't
you,
not
an
overage?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
mr.
attorney
general,
the
lower
court
was
disturbed
and
i
confess
that
i'm
somewhat
disturbed
by
the
current
fact
that
both
the
legislative
committee
and
the
legislature
itself
proceeded
to
draft,
consider
and
enact
a
bill
based
upon,
what
shall
i
say,
incorrect.
i
don't
want
to
use
a
harsher
word.
think
of
census
figures,
figures
that
did
not
truly
represent
the
census
figures
for
varies
of
these
districts.
and
the
variations
between
the
actual
census
figures
of
1960
and
the
figures
that
were
used
by
the
committee
and
represented
to
the
legislature
to
be
the
population
figures
and
those
census
figures,
that
difference
appears
to
be
quite
material.
what
is
the
explanation
of
that
if
you
can
tell
us
briefly,
because
offhand
it
appears
that
the
result
might
have
been
quite
different
in
theory
in
a
way?
the
result
that
the
legislature
reached
might
have
been
quite
different
if
they
had
been
working
on
the
actual
census
figures.
justice
abe
fortas
no,
that
doesn't
quite
work
here.
because
what
you're
talking
about
is
some
specific
figures
gotten
from
the
united
states
census
as
of
the
1960
census.
and
there's
no
--
there's
--
the
possibility
of
serious
man
engaged
in
the
serious
task
making
this
kind
of
a
material
error
with
respect
to
a
fact
so
easily
ascertained
and
so
objective
is
really
disturbing.
justice
abe
fortas
well
just
take
it
very
simply.
take
the
eighth
congressional
district
which
we've
been
talking
about
which
includes
pulaski
county.
justice
abe
fortas
if
the
--
if
the
--
on
the
basis
of
the
correct
figures,
the
overage
there
is
what,
3.13%
overage
over
the
ideal.
justice
abe
fortas
and
the
overage
over
the
smallest
district
is
in
the
neighborhood
of
6%,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
now
if
you
take
the
figures
that
the
legislature
used,
the
incorrect
figures
that
the
legislature
used,
the
percent
of
variation
in
district
eight,
pulaski
county
etcetera,
over
the
idea
would've
been
only
1.85,
isn't
that
what
your
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
submission
here
says?
justice
abe
fortas
and
if
you
--
and
i
don't
have
--
now
that's
1.85
over
the
ideal,
isn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
and
the
difference
between
the
largest
which
is
district
eight
and
the
smallest
would've
been
what?
justice
abe
fortas
what
been
around
say
3%
to
3.5%?
justice
abe
fortas
1.88.
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
what
you're
doing
is
comparing
a
6%
in
approximate
which
is
just
under
6%
variation
in
terms
of
the
true
facts
as
against
a
somewhat
around
of
3
to
4%
variation?
justice
abe
fortas
just
under
4%
variation
which
is
what
the
legislature
thought
it
was
doing.
justice
abe
fortas
now,
taking
into
account
the
fact
which
i
am
for
one
accept
that
we
should
give
a
great
deal
of
weight
to
what
the
legislature
does,
you
have
the
curiosity
here
which
seemed
to
have
impressed
the
lower
court
and
i
must
say
it
bothers
me
that
the
legislature
proceeded
on
the
basis
of,
what
shall
i
say
again
using
a
colorless
word,
incorrect
figures.
and
those
figures
would
come
out
only
after
the
court
proceedings
were
under
way,
isn't
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
is
it
a
matter
of
calculation
or
don't
you
get
from
the
census
county
by
county
figures?
justice
abe
fortas
so
it's
not
a
matter
of
having
to
make
a
recalculation
in
which
errors
of
allocation
or
what
not
might
occur,
because
they
get
their
figures
from
the
census
county
by
county
and
then
it's
a
matter
of
putting
them
together,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
the
lower
court
seems
to
have
been
so
impressed
by
it
and
you
would
be
really
asked
to
do
is
to
give
the
legislature
the
usual
presumption
of
the
correctness
of
its
result.
despite
the
fact
here
that
legislature
was
proceeding
on
obviously
now
admittedly
incorrect
data.
it's
a
strange
situation.
i
think
you'd
go
that
far
with
me,
wouldn't
you?
justice
abe
fortas
it
makes
it
five.
three
and
two
make
five
don't
--
justice
abe
fortas
three
and
two
make
five.
justice
abe
fortas
but
if
you
carry
that
kind
of
analysis
to
the
state
as
a
whole,
nobody's
been
that
is
both
diluted
at
all.
justice
abe
fortas
53
of
the
appendix?
justice
abe
fortas
does
your
position
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
if
the
state
laid
up
a
noncontiguous
congressional
district.
that
is
to
say
the
selected
counties
at
various
parts
of
the
state
maybe
not
contiguous,
that
that
would
be
constitutionally
unobjectionable
provided
that
the
figures
worked
out
alright?
justice
abe
fortas
but
then
your
point
must
be
that
for
example
the
congressional
district
number
eight
here
does
not
present
such
a
problem
that
is
to
say
that
the
factor
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
is
not
--
doesn't
appear
to
be
compact
does
raise
problem.
i
note
that
jefferson
county
and
texas
county
were
both
put
in
to
the
district
with
the
majority
of
the
other
counties
to
form
district
eight,
isn't
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
no,
i
don't
--
has
texas
county
been
in
the
--
and
has
jefferson
county
been
in
the
same
congressional
district
as
osage
and
cole
and
miller
and
so
on
there?
justice
abe
fortas
perhaps
i've
been
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
may
have
misread
some
of
the
maps
there.
justice
abe
fortas
oh,
i
see.
justice
abe
fortas
but
in
any
event,
you
would
agree
then
and
i
think
this
may
be
a
modification.
it's
a
modification
what
i
understood
you
to
say
earlier
maybe
that
compactness
--
contiguity
and
compactness
are
permissible
factors
to
take
into
account
in
connection
with
the
constitutional
problem
facing
this
court?
justice
abe
fortas
may
i
ask
you,
sorry,
may
i
ask
you
this
question?
you
may
want
to
answer
it
after
lunch,
it
works
to
be
all
right
for
me.
your
argument
seems
to
me
in
one
respect
in
a
way
depends
upon
burden
of
proof.
and
your
brief
i
guess
that
the
burden
of
proof
to
burden
of
justifying
deviations
from
the
ideal
is
on
the
state.
now
i
wonder
if
it
is
impossible
that
the
question
of
burden
of
proof
may
be
a
little
more
complex
than
that.
and
where
you
have
what
appears
to
be
a
gross
for
non-permissible
variation,
whatever
figure
you
may
target
figure
one
may
have
in
mind.
if
i
have
10%
in
particular.
whatever
target
figure
in
the
particular
circumstances
one
may
have
in
mind,
where
there
is
a
mathematically
large
or
a
gross
deviation
from
the
one
man,
one
vote
mathematics.
but
then
the
burden
is
on
the
state
to
justify
it.
but
may
it
not
be
that
where
and
perhaps
this
is
such
a
case,
and
this
perhaps
this
is
such
a
case
that
where
the
variation
is
relatively
modest
that
the
burden
may
then
be
on
those
attacking
the
plan.
that
is
to
say
that
you're
trying
now
to
bear
that
burden
in
one
respect
by
saying
that
the
state
could
do
better
and
could
come
to
a
closer
approximation
of
the
mathematically
ideal.
so
my
brother
have
asked
you
whether
you
have
other
complaints
about
the
plans,
such
as
political
gerrymandering
or
other
attempts
to
keep
incumbents
in
office
or
whatever
it
may
be?
and
as
i
understand
it,
your
answer
to
that
has
been
no.
but
what
i'm
saying
to
you
is
that
isn't
it
possible
that
where
the
figures
of
such
that
the
mathematical
deviation
does
not
appear
gross
that
the
burden
is
then
on
the
other
party,
namely
the
party
attacking
the
plan.
justice
abe
fortas
there
is
certainly
may
be
a
more
accurate
way
of
stating
it.
justice
abe
fortas
but
if
you
assume
that
they
have
--
the
state
has
before
its
burden
by
showing
that
these
figures
are
within
tolerable
range,
then
the
only
thing
you've
been
talking
about
thus
far
is
that
they
could've
done
better?
justice
abe
fortas
can
you,
without
too
much
trouble,
indicate
what
were
the
lines
of
the
eighth
district
before
this
redistricting?
was
jefferson
county
in
that
same
district?
justice
abe
fortas
there's
no
map
anywhere
in
these
papers,
is
there
that
shows
district
lines
before
the
redistricting?
justice
abe
fortas
in
what
congressional
district
is
pulaski
county?
justice
abe
fortas
but
where
you
have
an
underage
don't
you,
not
an
overage?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
mr.

i
don't

think
of
census
figures,
figures
that
did
not
truly
represent
the
census
figures
for
varies
of
these
districts.
and
the
variations
between
the
actual
census
figures
of

figures

just
take
it
very

take

justice

may
it
not
be
that
where
and
perhaps
this
is
such
a
case,
and
this
perhaps
this
is
such
a
case
that
where
the
variation
is
relatively
modest
that
the
burden
may
then
be
on
those
attacking
the
plan.
that
is
to
say
that
you're
trying
now
to
bear
that
burden
in
one
respect
by
saying
that
the
state
could
do
better
and
could
come
to
a
closer
approximation
of
the
mathematically
ideal.
so
my
brother
have
asked
you
whether
you
have
other
complaints
about
the
plans,
such
as
political
gerrymandering
or
other
attempts
to
keep
incumbents
in
office
or
whatever
it
may
be?
and
as
i
understand
it,
your
answer
to
that
has
been
no.
but
what
i'm
saying
to
you
is
that
isn't
it
possible
that
where
the
figures
of
such
that
the
mathematical
deviation
does
not
appear
gross
that
the
burden
is
then
on
the
other
party,
namely
the
party
attacking
the
plan.
justice
abe
fortas
there
is
certainly
may
be
a
more
accurate
way
of
stating
it.
justice
abe
fortas
but
if
you
assume
that
they
have
--
the
state
has
before
its
burden
by
showing
that
these
figures
are
within
tolerable
range,
then
the
only
thing
you've
been
talking
about
thus
far
is
that
they
could've
done
better?
justice
abe
fortas
can
you,
without
too
much
trouble,
indicate
what
were
the
lines
of
the
eighth
district
before
this
redistricting?
was
jefferson
county
in
that
same
district?
justice
abe
fortas
there's
no
map
anywhere
in
these
papers,
is
there
that
shows
district
lines
before
the
redistricting?
