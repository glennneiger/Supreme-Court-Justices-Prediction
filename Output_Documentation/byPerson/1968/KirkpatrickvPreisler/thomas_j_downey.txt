mr.
thomas
j.
downey
may
it
please
the
court,
mr.
chief
justice.
this
is
an
appeal
from
the
judgment
and
decree
of
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
western
district
of
missouri,
which
found
that
the
1967
missouri
congressional
redistricting
act
did
not
meet
the
requirements
of
article
i,
section
2
of
the
constitution.
two
members
of
the
court
concurred
in
the
majority
opinion.
one
member
of
the
court
dissented.
the
act
in
question
was
drafted
and
became
law
by
the
missouri
legislature
in
1967
following
the
invalidation
of
a
prior
congressional
redistricting
act.
the
missouri
legislature
has
called
a
general
assembly
meets
according
to
the
missouri
constitution
for
a
period
of
six
months
every
two
years.
it
convenes
in
january
and
its
term
expires
the
last
day
of
june.
the
legislature
began
considering
congressional
redistricting
in
1967
early
in
the
legislative
session,
and
during
the
six-month
period
more
than
16
different
proposed
bills
were
considered
by
the
legislature.
and
in
the
final
week
of
the
legislative
session,
the
1967
act
was
passed.
it
takes
a
constitutional
majority
in
each
house
of
the
missouri
legislature
for
any
law
to
be
passed.
there
are
163
members
of
the
lower
house
and
it
takes
82
votes
to
pass
a
bill.
there
are
34
members
in
the
senate.
it
takes
18
votes
to
pass
a
bill.
the
political
complexion
of
the
general
assembly
in
1967
was
107
democrats
in
the
lower
house
and
56
republicans.
in
the
upper
house,
it
was
23
democrats
and
11
republicans.
the
act
which
we
have
under
consideration
before
the
court
here
today
when
it
was
before
the
lower
house,
received
a
negative
vote
of
all
56
republicans.
the
act
on
original
consideration
in
the
senate
received
a
negative
of
all
11
republicans.
on
final
enactment
in
the
senate,
it
received
the
votes
of
10
republicans,
one
being
a
negative
vote.
now
i
point
this
out
to
the
court
because
although
the
republican
party
did
not
consider
this
act
to
be
favorable
to
the
republican
party
as
far
as
a
congressional
redistricting
plan
was
concerned.
the
leaders
of
the
republican
party,
the
house
leader
and
the
senate
leader
both
testified
before
the
lower
court
that
they
considered
this
act
to
be
a
reasonable
legislative
compromise.
and
that
had
they
been
in
control
of
the
legislature
that
in
all
likelihood,
the
political
complexion
of
the
districts
would
have
been
different.
but
the
numerical
disparities
in
the
districts
would
probably
have
been
approximately
the
same.
that
is
the
only
significance
in
bringing
out
this
particular
factor.
now
what
was
the
act
that
was
enacted?
missouri
according
to
the
1960
census
passed
a
population
or
had
a
population
of
approximately
4,320,000
people.
missouri
was
entitled
to
10
congressmen.
therefore,
each
congressional
district
if
you
had
an
ideal
mathematical
district
in
the
state
would
have
a
population
of
approximately
431,000
people.
the
act
that
was
passed,
there
was
a
population
disparity
between
the
largest
of
the
10
districts
and
the
smallest
of
the
10
districts
of
slightly
in
excess
of
25,000
population
based
upon
the
1960
census.
now,
what
does
this
mean
in
terms
of
relative
strength
in
population
or
relative
affect
on
voting
rights?
the
largest
district
in
percentage
terms
was
approximately
3%
larger
than
what
an
ideal
district
should
be.
the
smallest
district
was
slightly
less
than
3%
below
what
an
ideal
district
should
be.
the
ratio
of
the
largest
district
to
the
smallest
district
was
1.06.
now
that
is
the
factual
situation
with
which
we
are
dealing
here
this
morning.
it
is
appellant's
contentions
that
this
congressional
redistricting
plan
and
the
population
variations
reflected
by
this
congressional
redistricting
plan
are
per
se
constitutional
and
meet
the
requirements
of
article
i,
section
2
that
the
house
of
representatives
shall
be
chosen
by
the
people.
this
court
has
recognized
that
--
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
it
is
our
contention
mr.
chief
justice
that
this
act
is
legal.
and
that
the
population
variations
in
the
act
are
so
mindful
that
they
are
per
se
constitutional
that
the
variations
are
per
se
permissible
under
article
i,
section
2
of
the
constitution.
and
that
the
lower
court
--
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
yes,
your
honor.
i
--
if
you
got
into
larger
deviations
then
i
think
motivation
might
be
a
factor.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
and
that
of
course
is
the
big
question.
where
is
the
point
where
this
much
population
variation
is
okay,
and
this
much
is
all
wrong?
as
stated
by
one
court
a
number
of
years
ago,
it's
easy
to
tell
the
difference
between
noon
and
midnight.
but
it
is
very
difficult
to
tell
the
difference
between
dusk
and
darkness.
and
i
think
we
have
a
situation
here
which
on
the
face
of
it
is
in
that
realm
between
dusk
and
darkness.
and
--
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
the
largest
difference
your
honor
is
slightly
more
than
25,000.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
out
of
approximately
304
no
--
4,320,000
population
in
the
state
of
missouri.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
and
the
largest
district
is
445,000
population.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
and
that
is
25,000
larger
than
the
smallest
district
which
is
419,000
population.
now
there's
a
factor
in
that
larger
district
which
i
want
to
bring
to
the
attention
of
the
court.
there
is
transitory
nonresident
nonvoting
population
in
that
larger
district.
that
larger
district
contains
a
large
military
reservation,
fort
leonard
wood,
which
at
the
time
of
the
1960
census
had
approximately
35,000
soldiers.
the
district
contains
the
university
of
missouri
which
at
the
time
of
the
1960
census
had
about
15,000
students.
it
contains
other
smaller
elements
of
nonresident
transitory
population.
now
when
we
deal
--
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
the
eighth
district,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
they
are
contiguous
districts.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
we
have
several
factors.
one
is
this
factor
which
i
spoke
of,
of
the
large
number
of
transitory
populations
in
that
eighth
district.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
they
are.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
they
are
included
in
the
445.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
the
military
population
and
the
college
population
are
included
in
the
census
counts.
they're
included
in
that
overall
figure.
and
that
is
the
principle
fact.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
if
they
would
--
if
full
weight
was
given
to
the
population,
if
they
were
to
be
deducted
in
their
entirety
there
would
be
in
excess
of
50,000
population
taken
out
of
the
eighth
district.
now
--
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
that
would
be
assuming
that
all
over
nonresident,
yes
your
honor,
which
of
course
would
be
an
erroneous
subject.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
that
would
equalize
pretty
well.
now
we
think
we
have
illustrated
this
pretty
well
by
the
election
results
in
the
recent
election.
we
have
put
this
in
our
reply
brief
and
in
the
recent
election,
this
fourth
district
which
is
the
smallest
district.
we
took
the
vote
in
the
congressional
races.
there
was
a
contest
in
the
fourth
district
which
was
not
much
of
a
contest,
just
a
slight
contest.
yet,
that
district
ranks
number
six
in
total
votes
cast
in
the
1968
election.
yet,
in
the
eighth
district,
which
had
a
real
hot
congressional
contest,
the
--
in
vote
it
ranked
fourth
in
total
vote.
now
i
know
that
these
are
absolute
indications
of
population,
but
there
is
an
indication
of
this
transitory
nonvoting
population.
and
we
have
also
included
election
statistics
for
that
district
dating
back
to
1960
on
up
through
1968,
and
we
compared
the
ratio
of
votes
to
population
into
pulaski
county
which
includes
fort
leonard
wood.
with
every
county
which
surrounds
fort
leonard
wood.
and
it's
dramatically
illustrated
that
at
no
time
that
you
have
a
ratio
higher
than
10%
to
total
population
in
the
vote
of
pulaski
county.
and
in
the
surrounding
counties,
it
ranges
from
40
to
50%.
so
the
fact,
the
fact
of
this
transitory
nonresident
population
in
pulaski
county
is
very
evident
from
these
consistent
election
returns
over
the
year.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
the
ratio,
your
honor
is
the
ratio
of
the
total
number
of
votes
in
the
county
cast
in
a
particular
election
as
related
to
the
1960
census
population
for
that
county.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
in
other
words,
if
the
population
of
the
county
was
a
hundred
thousand.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
and
there
were
10,000
votes
cast
in
a
particular
election,
then
10%
of
the
population
voted
in
that
election
--
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
--
and
as
i
say
in
pulaski
county
where
fort
leonard
wood
is
located,
in
every
election
there
has
consistently
been
below
10%
of
the
population
voting.
and
in
the
surrounding
rural
areas,
the
ratio
has
been
between
40
and
50%
of
the
total
population
of
the
individual
counties.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
not
necessarily,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
we
made
this
comparison
simply
to
illustrate
the
fact
that
--
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
and
after
all,
we
are
talking
here
about
voting
rights.
we're
not
talking
about
the
rights
of
a
district.
the
district
has
no
rights.
it's
the
individual
voter
who
has
the
right.
and
the
question
before
the
court
is
whether
or
not
the
individual
voter's
right
has
been
deluded
or
debased.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
well,
i'm
saying
your
honor
that
you
have
to
look
at
the
entire
picture.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
we
say
first
of
all
your
honor,
we
say
first
of
all
that
these
are
de
minimis
variations
that
they
are
of
no
consequence.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
under
any
circumstances.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
that
a
ratio
of
1.06
to
1
is
not
a
significant
debasement
of
a
vote.
it's
not
a
significant
voted
illusion
in
and
of
itself.
there's
no
unconstitutional
deprivation
of
a
voting
right.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
we
contend,
your
honor
that
that
25,000
is
de
minimis.
and
that
that
it
is
not
a
--
it
is
not
an
unconstitutional
debasement
of
the
vote.and
as
i
say
the
ratio
is
1.06
to
1
and
we
reach
a
point
some
place
where
as
i
say
between
duskand
darkness.
we
--
it's
constitutionally
permissible.
so
we
say
first
of
all
this
is
constitutionally
permissible.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
well,
i
recognize
your
honor
that
you
may
not
agree
with
that
argument.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
you
may
come
to
conclusion
that
this
is
an
unconstitutional
debasement
of
a
vote.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
and
in
recognition
of
that,
i
say
that
this
25,000
difference
is
justified
in
the
context
of
this
particular
case.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
that
is
my
position,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
pulaski
county
is
in
the
eighth
district,
your
honor,
the
largest
district.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
we
have
--
it
is
the
largest
district.
the
eighth
district
is
25,000
plus
more
than
the
smallest
district
which
is
the
fourth
district.
the
eighth
district
has
a
population
of
445,523.
the
fourth
is
the
smallest
with
419,721.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
the
eighth
district
of
course
--
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
--
your
honor.
well
as
i
--
i've
already
pointed
out
to
the
court.
we
have
pulaski
county
here
with
this
46,000
population.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
and
what
would
actually
about
10
or
11,000
of
that
population
being
resident
voting
population.
now
--
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
well
my
only
reply
to
that
question,
your
honor,
is
that
this
is
the
legislature
at
work.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
trying
to
agree
upon
districts
will
come
within
reasonable
population
variations
and
districts
that
will
meet
the
requirements
of
the
constitution.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
well,
i
think
your
honor
that
it
is
contiguous.
it
may
not
be
as
compact
as
it
could.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
i
believe
that
--
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
yes,
your
honor
i'm
sorry.
i
believe
that
the
district
is
contiguous.
it
may
not
be
as
compact
as
it
could
be.
but
if
you
will
examine
the
remaining
districts,
the
remaining
districts
do
have
a
reasonable
compactness
about
them.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
and
you
simply
--
when
you
get
into
this
business
of
drawing
districts,
you
get
into
what
has
been
called
redistricting
checkers
and
you
--
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
redistricting
checkers
or
dominoes
as
it
is
been
referred
to.
and
--
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
yes,
i
believe
the
judge
of
the
eighth
circuit
who
wrote
the
dissenting
opinion
referred
to
it
in
that
matter.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
not
in
a
favorable
way,
no
your
honor.
and
the
districts
other
than
the
eighth
are
reasonably
compact.
and
--
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
i
think
the
reason,
your
honor,
i
think
the
explanation
is
that
this
is
the
district
which
takes
in
the
central
part
of
the
state.
the
other
districts
do
surround
it.
there
was
a
county
taken
from
the
district
here,
and
put
there,
and
there
was
a
lot
of
trading
went
on
with
this
central
district.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
a
trading
of
counties.
according
to
county
in
and
the
taking
of
a
county
away,
and
--
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
i
don't
recall
that
factor
in
reynolds,
your
honor.
i
know
--
i
recall
that
reynolds
does
indicate
that
it
may
be
permissible
to
maintain
the
integrity
of
a
county.
but
i
don't
recall
that
factor
in
reynolds.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
i
think,
your
honor,
had
we
done
so
we
would've
made
this
district
look
worse.
we
would've
made
it
less
compact
than
it
is.
for
instance,
had
we
taken
this
county
here
and
put
it
in
the
tenth
district,
you
would
have
more
of
a
handle
down
here
than
you
have
now.
the
same
if
you
have
taken
howard
county
and
put
it
up
in
this
district,
you
would've
had
to
handle
on
the
sixth
district.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
saline
county,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
oh
in
the
eighth,
howard
county.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
and
that's
cooper
county.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
howard
10,859.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
cooper
15,448.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
right,
yes.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
that
you
put
those
two
counties
in
the
fourth
district
--
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
you
would
have
equalized
the
population.
you
would've
still
had
all
of
these
transitory
populations
down
in
pulaski
valley.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
look
pretty
poor,
your
honor,
in
my
opinion.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
a
matter
of
fact
it's
pretty
bad.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
it
doesn't
look
good,
i
recognize
that.
it
doesn't
look
good.
in
my
judgment
it
would
look
worse.
now
--
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
it
would've
equalized
pure
raw
census
statistics
figures.
yes
your
honor,
that's
true.
it
would've
done
so.
but
we
would've
still
had
all
of
this
transitory
military
population
in
pulaski
county
and
we
would've
ignored
the
fact
the
fourth
district
makes
them
the
growing
area
of
kansas
city,
an
area
of
growing
population
which
is
growing
tremendously
since
1960.
and
we're
talking
about
1967
were
building
districts
seven
years
later.
so
we
would've
completely
ignored
those
factors.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
we
have
some
other
military
installations
but
they
are
not
of
the
size
and
significance
of
fort
leonard
wood.
there's
--
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
they
were
not
taken
into
consideration
your
honor,
because
they
were
not
of
the
size
and
significance
of
this
board.
this
is
the
principal
military
installation
we
have
in
missouri.
we
have
some
air
bases
but
they
do
not
have
near
the
numbers
of
personnel
that
we
have
in
fort
leonard
wood.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
mr.
justice
fortas,
many
years
ago
chief
justice
hughes
in
speaking
before
the
american
bar
association
made
the
remark
that
in
this
world
of
imperfections
the
faults
of
human
clay
are
always
manifested.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
well,
your
honor
the
error
about
which
we
are
speaking
is
a
difference
between
the
plan
we
have
is
a
25,000
population
difference
between
the
smallest
and
the
largest
district.
what
the
legislature
thought
they
had
before
it
was
a
17,000
difference
or
a
difference
of
8,000
population.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
approximately
6%
larger
than
the
smallest
district.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
just
slightly
less
than
2%.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
the
smallest
district
under
what
the
legislature
thought
--
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
--
was
the
tenth
district
with
an
under
percentage
of
--
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
--1.88%.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
just
under
4%.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
that's
right,
your
honor.
i
can't
account
for
the
errors
that
were
made
except
to
say
that
it
appears
that
they
came
in
to
the
legislative
deliberations
in
the
closing
days
of
the
session
when
the
final
compromise
bill
was
being
hammered
out.
and
there's
nothing
to
indicate
that
they
were
anything
other
than
human
errors
that
crept
at
that
time.
the
basic
census
data
was
being
utilized.
and
i
can't
account
for
the
miscalculations.
now
there's
one
--
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
yes,
your
honor,
you
do.
and
there
--
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
well
there's
a
very
glaring
error,
your
honor,
right
up
here
in
the
sixth
district
which
contains
whole
counties.
there's
an
even
3,000
population
error
up
there.
and
it's
very
obvious
that
somebody
hit
the
wrong
key
on
an
adding
machine
when
they
were
doing
their
calculating.
somebody
hit
a
3
instead
of
a
5,
or
a
5
instead
of
3
because
it's
just
right
on
the
nose.
it's
3,000
and
it
isn't
3,001
or
anything
else.
and
i
only
--
my
only
explanation
is
that
this
was
human
error
that
crept
into
the
calculations
in
the
closing
days
of
the
legislature.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
well
i
don't
agree
that
the
situation
is
as
serious
as
the
lower
court
has
made
it
out
to
be.
i
think
that
the
difference
between
4%
and
6%
is
a
pretty
slight
difference.
and
when
we
look
at
what
has
happened
in
other
states
where
errors
have
crept
in,
when
we
look
at
the
census
data
itself
what
the
census
bureau
admits
is
an
error
by
3%.
so
if
you
have
a
2%
error
in
your
calculations
from
data
that
is
admittedly
3%
in
error,
i
don't
think
that
that
is
a
serious
sin.
when
we
look
at
what
the
florida
court
--
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
pardon
me,
your
honor?
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
yes,
your
honor,
i
realize
that.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
and
it
could
as
well
make
it
one.
and
when
we
look
at
what
the
florida
court
did
when
they
were
drawing
districts
down
there
and
the
mistake
they
made
was
far
more
serious
than
this.
they
thought
they
had
8,000
population
difference
between
largest
and
smallest.
but
it
was
48,000.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
in
the
state
of
florida
in
gong
versus
kirk.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
and
that
was
brought
to
the
attention
of
this
court
and
this
court
found
nothing
wrong
with
it.
so
i
think
that
the
lower
court
has
dwelt
too
much
upon
this
matter
of
error
in
calculations.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
there's
nothing
in
the
record
your
honor
to
indicate
this
political
factor.
of
course
it
was
there.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
no,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
that
is
not
presented
to
the
court.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
that's
right,
your
honor.
as
i
say
naturally
at
any
redistricting
plan,
you
have
those
democratic-republican
factors
involved.
they
were
involved
in
this
plan.
and
the
republicans
generally
opposed
this
plan,
but
once
it
was
adopted
they
appeared
as
witnesses
before
the
lower
court.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
the
leaders
of
the
republican
party
that
--
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
the
minority
leader
of
the
house
and
the
minority
leader
of
the
senate.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
yes,
your
honor.
i
might
add
this
aside
that
there
was
one
district
created
which
was
absolutely
guaranteed
to
put
a
republican
in
congress.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
was
absolutely
guaranteed
to
put
a
republican
in
congress
and
--
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
that
was
the
second
district
to
the
city
of
st.
louis
that
--
or
the
county
of
st.
louis
that
had
been
strongly
republican
for
years
and
years
and
years.
and
it
was
confirmed
as
a
republican
district.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
but
the
people
didn't
follow
the
legislature
in
doing
that.
they
elected
a
democrat
last
november
from
that
heavily
republican
district.
and
so
--
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
it
doesn't
always
work.
no,
your
honor.
and
there
were
also
race
factors
involved
in
this
plan.
there
was
a
deliberate
attempt
to
create
a
district
that
would
elect
missouri's
first
negro
congressman.
and
that
was
successful,
that
missouri
did
elect
its
first
negro
congressman.
so
--
but
those
--
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
the
census
data
would
sustain
it
would
be
the
only
thing
your
honor
that's
--
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
there
was
no
testimony
on
that
point,
no.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
no.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
that's
right,
no
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
there's
no
testimony
to
that
effect.
it
could
be
implied
from
the
composition
of
the
districts.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
that's
right.
there
was
no
testimony
but
as
i
say
it
could
be
implied
from
the
composition
of
the
districts,
because
the
districts
were
drawn
where
an
incumbent
resides
in
each
of
the
existing
districts.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
these
were
very
definitely
facts
that
influenced
the
legislature
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
there
are
not.
we
--
there're
no
record
was
made
on
that.
frankly,
we
didn't
think
it
was
relevant
to
the
question
of
--
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
it
would
be
relevant
only
in
so
far
as
to
population
disparity
of
a
district
would
be
involved,
your
honor.
that
would
be
my
opinion.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
well
there
again,
there's
nothing
in
the
record
in
regard
to
that.
but
there
was
great
deal
of
--
there
was
some
controversy
that
crept
into
that
picture.
the
incumbent
congressman
in
the
eighth
district
lives
in
texas
county
which
is
the
southern
most
county.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
texas
county,
your
honor.
that's
this
county
right
here.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
houston.
and
he's
a
very
popular
congressman
and
the
controversy
was
really
this.
some
of
your
democratic
political
leaders
over
here
and
what
we
call
the
bootheel
of
missouri
why
would
they
to
put
him
in
their
district,
because
their
congressman
was
retiring
and
they
wanted
him.
and
these
people
in
the
central
part
of
the
state
says
“no,
we
want
to
keep
him
here.”
so
there
was
another
factor
that
was
involved
in
drafting
these
districts.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
no,
your
honor.
--
is
howell
county
which
is
just
to
the
south
of
texas
county.
well,
i've
eaten
into
mr.
collins's
time
here
considerably,
your
honor.
and
i
know
that
he
wants
to
address
the
court,
so
thank
you.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
may
it
please
the
court,
mr.
chief
justice.
this
is
an
appeal
from
the
judgment
and
decree
of
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
western
district
of
missouri,
which
found
that
the
1967
missouri
congressional
redistricting
act
did
not
meet
the
requirements
of
article
i,
section
2
of
the
constitution.
two
members
of
the
court
concurred
in
the
majority
opinion.
one
member
of
the
court
dissented.
the
act
in
question
was
drafted
and
became
law
by
the
missouri
legislature
in
1967
following
the
invalidation
of
a
prior
congressional
redistricting
act.
the
missouri
legislature
has
called
a
general
assembly
meets
according
to
the
missouri
constitution
for
a
period
of
six
months
every
two
years.
it
convenes
in
january
and
its
term
expires
the
last
day
of
june.
the
legislature
began
considering
congressional
redistricting
in
1967
early
in
the
legislative
session,
and
during
the
six-month
period
more
than
16
different
proposed
bills
were
considered
by
the
legislature.
and
in
the
final
week
of
the
legislative
session,
the
1967
act
was
passed.
it
takes
a
constitutional
majority
in
each
house
of
the
missouri
legislature
for
any
law
to
be
passed.
there
are
163
members
of
the
lower
house
and
it
takes
82
votes
to
pass
a
bill.
there
are
34
members
in
the
senate.
it
takes
18
votes
to
pass
a
bill.
the
political
complexion
of
the
general
assembly
in
1967
was
107
democrats
in
the
lower
house
and
56
republicans.
in
the
upper
house,
it
was
23
democrats
and
11
republicans.
the
act
which
we
have
under
consideration
before
the
court
here
today
when
it
was
before
the
lower
house,
received
a
negative
vote
of
all
56
republicans.
the
act
on
original
consideration
in
the
senate
received
a
negative
of
all
11
republicans.
on
final
enactment
in
the
senate,
it
received
the
votes
of
10
republicans,
one
being
a
negative
vote.
now
i
point
this
out
to
the
court
because
although
the
republican
party
did
not
consider
this
act
to
be
favorable
to
the
republican
party
as
far
as
a
congressional
redistricting
plan
was
concerned.
the
leaders
of
the
republican
party,
the
house
leader
and
the
senate
leader
both
testified
before
the
lower
court
that
they
considered
this
act
to
be
a
reasonable
legislative
compromise.
and
that
had
they
been
in
control
of
the
legislature
that
in
all
likelihood,
the
political
complexion
of
the
districts
would
have
been
different.
but
the
numerical
disparities
in
the
districts
would
probably
have
been
approximately
the
same.
that
is
the
only
significance
in
bringing
out
this
particular
factor.
now
what
was
the
act
that
was
enacted?
missouri
according
to
the
1960
census
passed
a
population
or
had
a
population
of
approximately
4,320,000
people.
missouri
was
entitled
to
10
congressmen.
therefore,
each
congressional
district
if
you
had
an
ideal
mathematical
district
in
the
state
would
have
a
population
of
approximately
431,000
people.
the
act
that
was
passed,
there
was
a
population
disparity
between
the
largest
of
the
10
districts
and
the
smallest
of
the
10
districts
of
slightly
in
excess
of
25,000
population
based
upon
the
1960
census.
now,
what
does
this
mean
in
terms
of
relative
strength
in
population
or
relative
affect
on
voting
rights?
the
largest
district
in
percentage
terms
was
approximately
3%
larger
than
what
an
ideal
district
should
be.
the
smallest
district
was
slightly
less
than
3%
below
what
an
ideal
district
should
be.
the
ratio
of
the
largest
district
to
the
smallest
district
was
1.06.
now
that
is
the
factual
situation
with
which
we
are
dealing
here
this
morning.
it
is
appellant's
contentions
that
this
congressional
redistricting
plan
and
the
population
variations
reflected
by
this
congressional
redistricting
plan
are
per
se
constitutional
and
meet
the
requirements
of
article
i,
section
2
that
the
house
of
representatives
shall
be
chosen
by
the
people.
this
court
has
recognized
that
--
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
it
is
our
contention
mr.
chief
justice
that
this
act
is
legal.
and
that
the
population
variations
in
the
act
are
so
mindful
that
they
are
per
se
constitutional
that
the
variations
are
per
se
permissible
under
article
i,
section
2
of
the
constitution.
and
that
the
lower
court
--
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
yes,
your
honor.
i
--
if
you
got
into
larger
deviations
then
i
think
motivation
might
be
a
factor.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
and
that
of
course
is
the
big
question.
where
is
the
point
where
this
much
population
variation
is
okay,
and
this
much
is
all
wrong?
as
stated
by
one
court
a
number
of
years
ago,
it's
easy
to
tell
the
difference
between
noon
and
midnight.
but
it
is
very
difficult
to
tell
the
difference
between
dusk
and
darkness.
and
i
think
we
have
a
situation
here
which
on
the
face
of
it
is
in
that
realm
between
dusk
and
darkness.
and
--
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
the
largest
difference
your
honor
is
slightly
more
than
25,000.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
out
of
approximately
304
no
--
4,320,000
population
in
the
state
of
missouri.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
and
the
largest
district
is
445,000
population.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
and
that
is
25,000
larger
than
the
smallest
district
which
is
419,000
population.
now
there's
a
factor
in
that
larger
district
which
i
want
to
bring
to
the
attention
of
the
court.
there
is
transitory
nonresident
nonvoting
population
in
that
larger
district.
that
larger
district
contains
a
large
military
reservation,
fort
leonard
wood,
which
at
the
time
of
the
1960
census
had
approximately
35,000
soldiers.
the
district
contains
the
university
of
missouri
which
at
the
time
of
the
1960
census
had
about
15,000
students.
it
contains
other
smaller
elements
of
nonresident
transitory
population.
now
when
we
deal
--
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
the
eighth
district,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
they
are
contiguous
districts.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
we
have
several
factors.
one
is
this
factor
which
i
spoke
of,
of
the
large
number
of
transitory
populations
in
that
eighth
district.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
they
are.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
they
are
included
in
the
445.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
the
military
population
and
the
college
population
are
included
in
the
census
counts.
they're
included
in
that
overall
figure.
and
that
is
the
principle
fact.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
if
they
would
--
if
full
weight
was
given
to
the
population,
if
they
were
to
be
deducted
in
their
entirety
there
would
be
in
excess
of
50,000
population
taken
out
of
the
eighth
district.
now
--
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
that
would
be
assuming
that
all
over
nonresident,
yes
your
honor,
which
of
course
would
be
an
erroneous
subject.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
that
would
equalize
pretty
well.
now
we
think
we
have
illustrated
this
pretty
well
by
the
election
results
in
the
recent
election.
we
have
put
this
in
our
reply
brief
and
in
the
recent
election,
this
fourth
district
which
is
the
smallest
district.
we
took
the
vote
in
the
congressional
races.
there
was
a
contest
in
the
fourth
district
which
was
not
much
of
a
contest,
just
a
slight
contest.
yet,
that
district
ranks
number
six
in
total
votes
cast
in
the
1968
election.
yet,
in
the
eighth
district,
which
had
a
real
hot
congressional
contest,
the
--
in
vote
it
ranked
fourth
in
total
vote.
now
i
know
that
these
are
absolute
indications
of
population,
but
there
is
an
indication
of
this
transitory
nonvoting
population.
and
we
have
also
included
election
statistics
for
that
district
dating
back
to
1960
on
up
through
1968,
and
we
compared
the
ratio
of
votes
to
population
into
pulaski
county
which
includes
fort
leonard
wood.
with
every
county
which
surrounds
fort
leonard
wood.
and
it's
dramatically
illustrated
that
at
no
time
that
you
have
a
ratio
higher
than
10%
to
total
population
in
the
vote
of
pulaski
county.
and
in
the
surrounding
counties,
it
ranges
from
40
to
50%.
so
the
fact,
the
fact
of
this
transitory
nonresident
population
in
pulaski
county
is
very
evident
from
these
consistent
election
returns
over
the
year.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
the
ratio,
your
honor
is
the
ratio
of
the
total
number
of
votes
in
the
county
cast
in
a
particular
election
as
related
to
the
1960
census
population
for
that
county.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
in
other
words,
if
the
population
of
the
county
was
a
hundred
thousand.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
and
there
were
10,000
votes
cast
in
a
particular
election,
then
10%
of
the
population
voted
in
that
election
--
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
--
and
as
i
say
in
pulaski
county
where
fort
leonard
wood
is
located,
in
every
election
there
has
consistently
been
below
10%
of
the
population
voting.
and
in
the
surrounding
rural
areas,
the
ratio
has
been
between
40
and
50%
of
the
total
population
of
the
individual
counties.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
not
necessarily,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
we
made
this
comparison
simply
to
illustrate
the
fact
that
--
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
and
after
all,
we
are
talking
here
about
voting
rights.
we're
not
talking
about
the
rights
of
a
district.
the
district
has
no
rights.
it's
the
individual
voter
who
has
the
right.
and
the
question
before
the
court
is
whether
or
not
the
individual
voter's
right
has
been
deluded
or
debased.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
well,
i'm
saying
your
honor
that
you
have
to
look
at
the
entire
picture.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
we
say
first
of
all
your
honor,
we
say
first
of
all
that
these
are
de
minimis
variations
that
they
are
of
no
consequence.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
under
any
circumstances.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
that
a
ratio
of
1.06
to
1
is
not
a
significant
debasement
of
a
vote.
it's
not
a
significant
voted
illusion
in
and
of
itself.
there's
no
unconstitutional
deprivation
of
a
voting
right.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
we
contend,
your
honor
that
that
25,000
is
de
minimis.
and
that
that
it
is
not
a
--
it
is
not
an
unconstitutional
debasement
of
the
vote.and
as
i
say
the
ratio
is
1.06
to
1
and
we
reach
a
point
some
place
where
as
i
say
between
duskand
darkness.
we
--
it's
constitutionally
permissible.
so
we
say
first
of
all
this
is
constitutionally
permissible.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
well,
i
recognize
your
honor
that
you
may
not
agree
with
that
argument.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
you
may
come
to
conclusion
that
this
is
an
unconstitutional
debasement
of
a
vote.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
and
in
recognition
of
that,
i
say
that
this
25,000
difference
is
justified
in
the
context
of
this
particular
case.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
that
is
my
position,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
pulaski
county
is
in
the
eighth
district,
your
honor,
the
largest
district.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
we
have
--
it
is
the
largest
district.
the
eighth
district
is
25,000
plus
more
than
the
smallest
district
which
is
the
fourth
district.
the
eighth
district
has
a
population
of
445,523.
the
fourth
is
the
smallest
with
419,721.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
the
eighth
district
of
course
--
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
--
your
honor.
well
as
i
--
i've
already
pointed
out
to
the
court.
we
have
pulaski
county
here
with
this
46,000
population.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
and
what
would
actually
about
10
or
11,000
of
that
population
being
resident
voting
population.
now
--
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
well
my
only
reply
to
that
question,
your
honor,
is
that
this
is
the
legislature
at
work.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
trying
to
agree
upon
districts
will
come
within
reasonable
population
variations
and
districts
that
will
meet
the
requirements
of
the
constitution.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
well,
i
think
your
honor
that
it
is
contiguous.
it
may
not
be
as
compact
as
it
could.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
i
believe
that
--
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
yes,
your
honor
i'm
sorry.
i
believe
that
the
district
is
contiguous.
it
may
not
be
as
compact
as
it
could
be.
but
if
you
will
examine
the
remaining
districts,
the
remaining
districts
do
have
a
reasonable
compactness
about
them.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
and
you
simply
--
when
you
get
into
this
business
of
drawing
districts,
you
get
into
what
has
been
called
redistricting
checkers
and
you
--
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
redistricting
checkers
or
dominoes
as
it
is
been
referred
to.
and
--
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
yes,
i
believe
the
judge
of
the
eighth
circuit
who
wrote
the
dissenting
opinion
referred
to
it
in
that
matter.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
not
in
a
favorable
way,
no
your
honor.
and
the
districts
other
than
the
eighth
are
reasonably
compact.
and
--
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
i
think
the
reason,
your
honor,
i
think
the
explanation
is
that
this
is
the
district
which
takes
in
the
central
part
of
the
state.
the
other
districts
do
surround
it.
there
was
a
county
taken
from
the
district
here,
and
put
there,
and
there
was
a
lot
of
trading
went
on
with
this
central
district.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
a
trading
of
counties.
according
to
county
in
and
the
taking
of
a
county
away,
and
--
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
i
don't
recall
that
factor
in
reynolds,
your
honor.
i
know
--
i
recall
that
reynolds
does
indicate
that
it
may
be
permissible
to
maintain
the
integrity
of
a
county.
but
i
don't
recall
that
factor
in
reynolds.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
i
think,
your
honor,
had
we
done
so
we
would've
made
this
district
look
worse.
we
would've
made
it
less
compact
than
it
is.
for
instance,
had
we
taken
this
county
here
and
put
it
in
the
tenth
district,
you
would
have
more
of
a
handle
down
here
than
you
have
now.
the
same
if
you
have
taken
howard
county
and
put
it
up
in
this
district,
you
would've
had
to
handle
on
the
sixth
district.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
saline
county,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
oh
in
the
eighth,
howard
county.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
and
that's
cooper
county.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
howard
10,859.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
cooper
15,448.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
right,
yes.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
that
you
put
those
two
counties
in
the
fourth
district
--
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
you
would
have
equalized
the
population.
you
would've
still
had
all
of
these
transitory
populations
down
in
pulaski
valley.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
look
pretty
poor,
your
honor,
in
my
opinion.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
a
matter
of
fact
it's
pretty
bad.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
it
doesn't
look
good,
i
recognize
that.
it
doesn't
look
good.
in
my
judgment
it
would
look
worse.
now
--
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
it
would've
equalized
pure
raw
census
statistics
figures.
yes
your
honor,
that's
true.
it
would've
done
so.
but
we
would've
still
had
all
of
this
transitory
military
population
in
pulaski
county
and
we
would've
ignored
the
fact
the
fourth
district
makes
them
the
growing
area
of
kansas
city,
an
area
of
growing
population
which
is
growing
tremendously
since
1960.
and
we're
talking
about
1967
were
building
districts
seven
years
later.
so
we
would've
completely
ignored
those
factors.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
we
have
some
other
military
installations
but
they
are
not
of
the
size
and
significance
of
fort
leonard
wood.
there's
--
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
they
were
not
taken
into
consideration
your
honor,
because
they
were
not
of
the
size
and
significance
of
this
board.
this
is
the
principal
military
installation
we
have
in
missouri.
we
have
some
air
bases
but
they
do
not
have
near
the
numbers
of
personnel
that
we
have
in
fort
leonard
wood.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
mr.
justice
fortas,
many
years
ago
chief
justice
hughes
in
speaking
before
the
american
bar
association
made
the
remark
that
in
this
world
of
imperfections
the
faults
of
human
clay
are
always
manifested.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
well,
your
honor
the
error
about
which
we
are
speaking
is
a
difference
between
the
plan
we
have
is
a
25,000
population
difference
between
the
smallest
and
the
largest
district.
what
the
legislature
thought
they
had
before
it
was
a
17,000
difference
or
a
difference
of
8,000
population.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
approximately
6%
larger
than
the
smallest
district.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
just
slightly
less
than
2%.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
the
smallest
district
under
what
the
legislature
thought
--
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
--
was
the
tenth
district
with
an
under
percentage
of
--
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
--1.88%.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
just
under
4%.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
that's
right,
your
honor.
i
can't
account
for
the
errors
that
were
made
except
to
say
that
it
appears
that
they
came
in
to
the
legislative
deliberations
in
the
closing
days
of
the
session
when
the
final
compromise
bill
was
being
hammered
out.
and
there's
nothing
to
indicate
that
they
were
anything
other
than
human
errors
that
crept
at
that
time.
the
basic
census
data
was
being
utilized.
and
i
can't
account
for
the
miscalculations.
now
there's
one
--
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
yes,
your
honor,
you
do.
and
there
--
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
well
there's
a
very
glaring
error,
your
honor,
right
up
here
in
the
sixth
district
which
contains
whole
counties.
there's
an
even
3,000
population
error
up
there.
and
it's
very
obvious
that
somebody
hit
the
wrong
key
on
an
adding
machine
when
they
were
doing
their
calculating.
somebody
hit
a
3
instead
of
a
5,
or
a
5
instead
of
3
because
it's
just
right
on
the
nose.
it's
3,000
and
it
isn't
3,001
or
anything
else.
and
i
only
--
my
only
explanation
is
that
this
was
human
error
that
crept
into
the
calculations
in
the
closing
days
of
the
legislature.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
well
i
don't
agree
that
the
situation
is
as
serious
as
the
lower
court
has
made
it
out
to
be.
i
think
that
the
difference
between
4%
and
6%
is
a
pretty
slight
difference.
and
when
we
look
at
what
has
happened
in
other
states
where
errors
have
crept
in,
when
we
look
at
the
census
data
itself
what
the
census
bureau
admits
is
an
error
by
3%.
so
if
you
have
a
2%
error
in
your
calculations
from
data
that
is
admittedly
3%
in
error,
i
don't
think
that
that
is
a
serious
sin.
when
we
look
at
what
the
florida
court
--
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
pardon
me,
your
honor?
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
yes,
your
honor,
i
realize
that.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
and
it
could
as
well
make
it
one.
and
when
we
look
at
what
the
florida
court
did
when
they
were
drawing
districts
down
there
and
the
mistake
they
made
was
far
more
serious
than
this.
they
thought
they
had
8,000
population
difference
between
largest
and
smallest.
but
it
was
48,000.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
in
the
state
of
florida
in
gong
versus
kirk.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
and
that
was
brought
to
the
attention
of
this
court
and
this
court
found
nothing
wrong
with
it.
so
i
think
that
the
lower
court
has
dwelt
too
much
upon
this
matter
of
error
in
calculations.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
there's
nothing
in
the
record
your
honor
to
indicate
this
political
factor.
of
course
it
was
there.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
no,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
that
is
not
presented
to
the
court.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
that's
right,
your
honor.
as
i
say
naturally
at
any
redistricting
plan,
you
have
those
democratic-republican
factors
involved.
they
were
involved
in
this
plan.
and
the
republicans
generally
opposed
this
plan,
but
once
it
was
adopted
they
appeared
as
witnesses
before
the
lower
court.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
the
leaders
of
the
republican
party
that
--
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
the
minority
leader
of
the
house
and
the
minority
leader
of
the
senate.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
yes,
your
honor.
i
might
add
this
aside
that
there
was
one
district
created
which
was
absolutely
guaranteed
to
put
a
republican
in
congress.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
was
absolutely
guaranteed
to
put
a
republican
in
congress
and
--
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
that
was
the
second
district
to
the
city
of
st.
louis
that
--
or
the
county
of
st.
louis
that
had
been
strongly
republican
for
years
and
years
and
years.
and
it
was
confirmed
as
a
republican
district.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
but
the
people
didn't
follow
the
legislature
in
doing
that.
they
elected
a
democrat
last
november
from
that
heavily
republican
district.
and
so
--
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
it
doesn't
always
work.
no,
your
honor.
and
there
were
also
race
factors
involved
in
this
plan.
there
was
a
deliberate
attempt
to
create
a
district
that
would
elect
missouri's
first
negro
congressman.
and
that
was
successful,
that
missouri
did
elect
its
first
negro
congressman.
so
--
but
those
--
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
the
census
data
would
sustain
it
would
be
the
only
thing
your
honor
that's
--
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
there
was
no
testimony
on
that
point,
no.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
no.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
that's
right,
no
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
there's
no
testimony
to
that
effect.
it
could
be
implied
from
the
composition
of
the
districts.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
that's
right.
there
was
no
testimony
but
as
i
say
it
could
be
implied
from
the
composition
of
the
districts,
because
the
districts
were
drawn
where
an
incumbent
resides
in
each
of
the
existing
districts.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
these
were
very
definitely
facts
that
influenced
the
legislature
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
there
are
not.
we
--
there're
no
record
was
made
on
that.
frankly,
we
didn't
think
it
was
relevant
to
the
question
of
--
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
it
would
be
relevant
only
in
so
far
as
to
population
disparity
of
a
district
would
be
involved,
your
honor.
that
would
be
my
opinion.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
well
there
again,
there's
nothing
in
the
record
in
regard
to
that.
but
there
was
great
deal
of
--
there
was
some
controversy
that
crept
into
that
picture.
the
incumbent
congressman
in
the
eighth
district
lives
in
texas
county
which
is
the
southern
most
county.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
texas
county,
your
honor.
that's
this
county
right
here.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
houston.
and
he's
a
very
popular
congressman
and
the
controversy
was
really
this.
some
of
your
democratic
political
leaders
over
here
and
what
we
call
the
bootheel
of
missouri
why
would
they
to
put
him
in
their
district,
because
their
congressman
was
retiring
and
they
wanted
him.
and
these
people
in
the
central
part
of
the
state
says
“no,
we
want
to
keep
him
here.”
so
there
was
another
factor
that
was
involved
in
drafting
these
districts.
mr.
thomas
j.
downey
no,
your
honor.
--
is
howell
county
which
is
just
to
the
south
of
texas
county.
well,
i've
eaten
into
mr.
collins's
time
here
considerably,
your
honor.
and
i
know
that
he
wants
to
address
the
court,
so
thank
you.
