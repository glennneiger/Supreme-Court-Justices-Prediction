justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
largest
difference?
justice
hugo
l.
black
out
of
how
many
people?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
talking
about
the
whole
state.
i'm
talking
about
for
the
district.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
the
one
in
which
there's
the
25,000
difference?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
any
furious
argument
made
here
supported
by
strong
areas
part
of
those
either
who
support
or
reject
the
reapportionment
that
there's
really
difference
in
order
to
change
the
results
of
the
district
of
having
a
republican
congressman
instead
of
a
democratic
congressman,
or
a
democratic
congressman
instead
of
a
republican
congressman?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
the
argument
it's
made.
do
they
make
an
argument
either
side?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
argument
is
not
presented
to
us?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
we
can
take
the
case
as
though
there's
no
question
raised
in
it
which
requires
our
attention,
might
involve
a
deliberate
effort
to
shift
parties
in
congressional
districts.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
the
said
republicans?
justice
hugo
l.
black
who's
the
leader?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
which
one
is
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
didn't
change?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
showed
this
doesn't
always
work.
justice
hugo
l.
black
were
there
any
findings
to
that
effect?
justice
hugo
l.
black
or
might
it
not
be
relevant
if
they
deliberately
made
the
district
that
it
was
not
a
convenience
in
order
to
elect
white
men
or
colored
men
either
one
might
have
not
make
a
difference.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
county?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what's
the
county's
city?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
the
--
in
that
district?
justice
hugo
l.
black
could
the
census
bureau
indicate
why
it
conceded
a
possible
error
as
much
as
3%?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
there
a
witness
from
the
census
bureau
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
did
this
get
into
the
record?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
the
stipulation?
where
is
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
he
knows,
would
you
get
him
to
tell
you
later
so
you
can
let
us
know?
justice
hugo
l.
black
of
the
appellant?
justice
hugo
l.
black
reply
brief.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
the
date
of
that
brief?
i
don't
believe
i
have
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
do
you
say
is
the
test?
what
do
you
argue
is
the
test
for
the
judges
to
decide?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
crucial?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
do
you
suggest
the
legislature
could've
done?
could
have
vote
about
a
more
near
approach
to
you.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
difference
would
that
have
made
in
the
other
districts?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
5,000
people?
justice
hugo
l.
black
splitting
up
the
counties?
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
that
split
the
county?
justice
hugo
l.
black
keep
it
in
the
same
district?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
it's
advisable
if
possible,
to
keep
the
identity
of
the
county
boundaries
on
congressional
district?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
that's
absolutely
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
absolutely
necessary,
i
mean
in
the
big
cities.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
i
see
in
some
of
the
very
large
cities.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
make
any
complaint
about
the
structure
of
that
eight?
just
looking
at
it
is
anything
it
should
have
been
division?
justice
hugo
l.
black
with
reference
to
the
way
it's
built?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
guess
they
will
always
do
that,
won't
they?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
is
the
dispute
simply
over
that
in
fact
that
the
courts
have
said
they
must
be
nearly
like
as
possible
in
population?
that
abstractly,
you
don't
think
they
are
and
that
you
could
take
it
as
just
made
a
little
closer?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
there's
no
--
you
have
no
argument
of
any
kind
based
on
the
fact
that
somehow
that
voters
are
going
to
be
heard
of
what
is
done?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
do
you
think
--
do
you
think
that's
not
worthy
of
any
consideration
whatever?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
mean,
do
you
think
or
maybe
so
but
do
you
think
it
has
no
right
to
have
any
weight
at
all,
practical
pragmatic
situation
of
what
you
can
do
in
the
legislative
body?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
do
then
think
it
should
be
given
some
weight
but
you
don't
say
how
much.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that
is
a
pragmatic
fact
of
life
that
has
to
be
considered,
doesn't
it?
is
that
you
stated
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
now
if
that's
true,
unless
you
can
show
something,
it
just
shocks
you
someway.
just
so
outrageous
that
nobody
can
take
it.
or
you
can
show
that
it
aids
the
republicans
or
helps
the
democrats
or
does
vice
versa.
why
should
we
not
take
into
consideration?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
do
we
know
how
much
those
--
they
live
in
that
district.
they
know
how
to
work
together
and
fight
together
and
what
the
practical
history
has
been
before.
and
to
be
required,
assume
simply
to
acquire
--
maybe
they've
done
this
good
as
practical
unless
you
just
split
up
the
county
from
the
precinct,
doesn't
it?
how
do
you
know
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
know
that
very
well
and
i
said
it
isn't
that
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
why
they
said
it
from
what
the
court
held.
but
that
was
a
big
understandable
on
its
face
so
outrageous
and
so
far
from
what
was
practical
that
that
rather
answered
itself.
justice
hugo
l.
black
without
regard
to
the
fact
that
the
trade
--
they
are
in
the
legislature
and
they're
doing
the
best
they
can
to
bring
them
out
any
further.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
largest
difference?
justice
hugo
l.
black
out
of
how
many
people?
justice
hugo
