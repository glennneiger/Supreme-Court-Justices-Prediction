justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
downey,
i
gather
the
larger
of
the
two
was
eight
is
it?
is
that
district
eight
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
smallest
is
district
four
with
419,000
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
they're
contiguous
districts,
aren't
they?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
what
explains
that
difference
between
contiguous
districts?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
they're
not
included
in
the
419,000
are
they?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
or
rather
445,
they
are?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
the
military
population
plus
the
college
population?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
if
you
--
and
if
they
were
to
be
deducted
from
the
445,
what
would
the
figure
then
be
for
eight?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
suppose
you
would
take
one
of
those
two
counties
along
the
line
between
the
fourth
and
the
eighth,
as
i
look
back
here.
are
those
two
counties
in
the
eighth
along
the
line
of
the
fourth?
no,
no
that's
right,
right
there.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no
in
the
eighth.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
below
that
is
what?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
what's
the
population
of
those
two
joint?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
next.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
alright,
right
there
that's
25,000
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
suppose
you
put
those
two
counties
on
the
fourth?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
would
that
equalize
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
you
done
that,
the
eighth
wouldn't
have
looked
any
worse
that
does
now.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
maybe
it
wouldn't
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
be
pretty
poor
now.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
think
mr.
downey
suggested,
mr.
collins
that
there
are
who
--
wherein
they
vote
going
on
population
changes.
are
they
both
districts
of
the
increase,
i
take
it
there's
an
increase
of
population
in
that
kind
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
you
are
suggesting
was
because
of
kansas
city
in
the
fourth
and
its
environs?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there
is
a
trend
that's
possible
in
any
event
in
the
way
of
increase
there
is
if
any
in
eight
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
that
is
15,
17,000
approximate
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
did
i
understand
you
to
say
mr.
achtenberg
that
you
are
not
defending
the
district
court
judgment
on
any
ground
that
in
any
event
aid
as
a
gerrymander
and
an
infamous
one?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
no,
no
but
are
you
--
are
you
defending
the
district
court
judgment
on
the
ground
that
eight
constitutes
an
impermissible
political
gerrymandering?
i
don't
read
anything
you
said
in
your
briefs.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
are
your
clients
concerned
only
of,
i
mean
is
there
any
practical
foundation
for
political
or
something
for
your
protest
against
this
result?
what
is
it,
are
you
just
concerned
to
raise
and
have
decided
of
abstract
question
whether
excesses
and
overages
are
wrong
or
is
there
something
else
that
your
client
considers?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
your
client's
only
interest
in
this
is
that
it
be
done
as
the
constitutional
decisions
require
it
to
be,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
narrowly
you
know
in
these
cases?
there
seem
to
be
partisan
interest
served
by
different
sides,
but
that's
not
true
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
there
any
improper
counties
you
describe
with
the
legislature?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
