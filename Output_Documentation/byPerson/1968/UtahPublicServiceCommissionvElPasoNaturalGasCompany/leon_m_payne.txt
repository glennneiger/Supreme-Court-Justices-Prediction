mr.
leon
m.
payne
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
i'm
counsel
for
el
paso
natural
gas
company
and
have
been
serving
as
such
since
this
court's
decision
in
cascade.
as
i
understand
the
questions
which
were
before
the
court
for
discussion
this
morning.
they
relate
to
two
questions.
one,
should
the
motion
of
utah
to
dismiss
the
case
be
granted
or
denied,
and
secondly,
should
mr.
bennett's
motion
for
another
hearing
in
the
case
be
granted
or
denied.
i
would
argue
to
you
that
the
motion
of
utah
should
be
granted.
i
think
that
the
rules
are
clear
that
an
appellant
who
does
not
wish
to
follow
an
appeal
has
the
right
to
be
relieved.
i
would
be
the
last
to
argue
to
this
court
however
that
the
granting
of
the
motion
to
dismiss
filed
by
utah
is
a
bar
to
this
court's
ability
or
power
to
police
its
own
mandates.
i
am
not
arguing
that,
i
think
this
court
can
police
its
mandates.
i
think
the
question
presented
therefore
by
the
second
of
the
two
motions
i
described
is
not
whether
the
court
can
police
its
mandates
but
whether
it
should
in
this
case
reopen
--
mr.
leon
m.
payne
yes
sir,
we
have
filed
a
brief
in
this
case.
mr.
leon
m.
payne
it's
typewritten,
your
honor.
we
didn't
have
time
to
print
it.
mr.
leon
m.
payne
yes
sir.
the
question
then
really
should
turn
on
whether
this
is
the
kind
of
case
in
which
the
court
should
reach
down
into
the
district
court
proceedings,
bring
them
up
and
reopen
them.
i
submit
to
your
honors
that
this
is
not
a
case
in
which
that
remedy
should
be
employed.
i
would
like
to
just
point
out
that
the
court
has
in
other
cases
reached
down
and
policed
its
mandate
and
those
cases
however,
and
i
believe
i'm
correct
in
all
cases
where
the
court
has
written
on
the
subject.
the
matter
has
been
properly
before
it
on
appeal.
i
would
suggest
to
you
that
this
matter
is
before
you
on
the
written
plate
papers
of
three
individuals.
and
just
as
an
example,
i
would
like
to
give
you
three
instances
of
why
i
don't
think
this
court
should
reach
down
and
reopen
the
decision
below.
running
throughout
the
pleadings
filed
by
messrs.
bennett,
stewart,
and
flynn
are
lured
allegations
that
el
paso
in
some
way
has
profited
by
the
failure
to
divest
these
properties
which
your
honors
ordered
us
to
do
in
u.s.
v.
el
paso.
and
that
this
means
that
corporate
crime
pays
and
that
in
some
way
el
paso
is
pocketing
$22,000.00
a
day
of
ill-gotten
gains.
i
would
like
to
set
its
record
straight
on
that.
as
all
of
us
know
who
are
in
the
court
below,
the
lower
court
judge
chilson
made
inquiry
whether
under
the
divesture
proposed,
el
paso
stood
to
gain
or
lose
by
its
divestiture
of
northwest
properties.
we
produced
an
exhibit,
its
exhibit
65
that
was
distributed
to
all
counsel
that
was
placed
in
the
record
and
supported
by
sworn
testimony.
that
exhibit
shows
that
el
paso's
total
investment
in
these
properties
from
1957
on
is
a
matter
of
some
$579
million.
when
that
investment
is
reduced
by
the
full
amount
of
the
investment
in
west
coast
stock
and
northwest
production
stock
which
el
paso
acquired
in
the
acquisition
but
which
it
is
not
divesting
to
the
new
company
here.
and
when
that
investment
is
further
reduced
by
every
dollar
that
el
paso
has
recouped
from
its
operation
of
these
properties,
depreciation,
depletion,
amortization,
and
importantly
every
dollar
of
income
which
has
been
derived
from
the
operation
of
these
properties,
that's
the
$22,000.00
a
day,
when
all
of
that
is
subtracted,
when
the
debt
that
is
to
be
transferred
to
the
new
company
is
subtracted
that
el
paso
has
a
net
unrecouped
investment
in
these
properties
of
$146
million.
now,
stated
in
other
way
that
means
that
when
we
have
divested
these
properties
which
we
have
owned
and
operated
for
12
years,
but
we
are
paid
$100
million
in
the
form
of
stock
of
new
company.
we
will
have
a
loss
over
these
years
of
operation
of
$46
million.
now,
someone
will
be
quick
to
point
out
that
we
are
retaining
the
west
coast
stock
and
the
northwest
production
stock
both
of
those
are
ordered
to
be
divested
by
the
court.
our
investment
in
those
two
assets
is
$75
million.
on
the
market
today,
they
will
bring
approximately
$35
million
so
that
we
have
an
additional
$40
million
of
loss
which
we
face
when
we
divest
these
two
assets
that
we
are
retaining.
therefore,
i
say
to
you
that
this
is
not
a
case
in
which
the
supreme
court
should
be
concerned
over
the
questions
raised
in
the
pleadings
of
messrs.
bennett,
flynn,
and
stewart
as
to
whether
or
not
the
clayton
act
divestiture.
the
court
should
inquire
into
whether
the
divesting
company
has
realized
the
profit
or
a
loss.
this
is
a
question
of
where
the
facts
are
undisputed
that
el
paso
has
realized
an
enormous
loss
in
the
operation
and
divestiture
of
these
properties.
two
other
points,
we
are
told
that
el
paso
has
resisted
a
cash
sale
as
mr.
bennett
puts
it
a
clean
cash
sale
without
residual
complications.
mr.
bennett
is
correct,
we
have
resisted
that
form
of
divestiture
since
the
beginning
and
the
reason
is
very
simple.
we
are
engaged
in
a
divestiture
plan,
not
el
paso's
plan,
the
court's
plan
in
which
we
will
receive
$100
million
of
preferred
stock.
that
exchange,
the
assets
for
preferred
stock
will
be
tax
free
and
we
have
a
ruling
from
the
irs
to
that
effect.
where
we
to
follow
mr.
bennett's
suggestion
and
sell
the
same
properties
for
$100
million
of
cash,
it
would
generate
a
tax
unnecessary
in
the
range
of
$50
million.
that
is
a
residual
complication
which
we
consider
we
are
entitled
to
take
into
account.
now,
in
a
minute
or
so
i
have
left,
i'd
like
to
comment
on
the
allegations
that
we
have
been
dilatory
in
seeking
relief.
el
paso
has
never
fought
for
delay,
el
paso
has
never
taken
an
appeal
to
this
court,
el
paso
has
never
failed
to
meet
the
deadline
imposed
by
the
court
below,
we
have
tried
our
case,
and
we
stand
ready
to
divest.
before
the
court's
order
was
even
final,
we
apply
to
the
federal
power
commission
for
the
necessary
certificates
to
augment
the
court's
decree.
that
proceeding
has
been
heard,
the
record
is
close,
the
briefs
are
in.
there
has
been
no
opposition
from
any
party.
messrs
flynn,
stewart
and
bennett
were
not
a
party
to
that
proceeding.
the
commission
stands
ready
to
issue
its
order
authorizing
the
divestiture
of
these
properties.
el
paso
at
this
moment
is
ready,
able,
willing,
and
i
may
say
without
any
ranker
for
the
last
12
years.
we
are
anxious
to
divest
these
properties.
we
can
complete
the
divestiture
in
90
days.
we
await
only
to
permission
to
do
so.
i
strongly
urge
this
court
not
to
reopen
these
proceedings.
thank
you.
