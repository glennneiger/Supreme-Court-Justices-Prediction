mr.
irwin
n.
griswold
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
response
to
the
court's
invitation,
i
have
filed
a
memorandum
on
behalf
of
the
united
states
and
which
we
say
that
we
have
no
objection
to
the
dismissal
of
utah's
appeal.
in
developing
the
reasons
which
lay
behind
the
position
of
the
united
states,
it
seems
to
me
that
it
maybe
helpful
to
summarize
the
process
by
which
they
were
determined.
in
this
case,
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
was
rendered
on
august
29,
1968.
at
that
time,
i
knew
nothing
about
the
case.
it
is
not
a
part
of
the
responsibility
of
the
solicitor
general
to
try
cases
in
the
district
court
and
the
trial
in
this
case
had
in
fact
begun
before
i
had
taken
public
office.
the
case
was
in
charge
of
the
antitrust
division
which
was
the
appropriate
place
for
it
to
be
handled
in
the
department
of
justice.
under
the
statute
and
rules,
the
notice
of
appeal
must
be
filed
within
60
days
after
the
judgment
was
entered.
that
expired
on
october
28,
1968
and
on
that
day
a
notice
of
appeal
was
filed.
i
knew
nothing
about
that,
made
no
authorization
of
it.
this
is
in
accordance
with
the
regular
departmental
practice.
it's
not
a
situation
that
i
particularly
like
but
neither
i
nor
my
predecessors
have
been
able
to
change
it
effectively.
the
practice
is
that
a
notice
of
appeal
is
more
or
less
automatically
filed
and
eventually
a
recommendation
comes
to
the
solicitor
general
if
he
decides
that
the
appeal
should
not
be
taken
then
the
appeal
is
not
perfected.
under
the
statute,
the
time
for
docketing
the
appeal
expired
90
days
after
the
judgment
was
entered.
that
would
have
been
november
28,
1968
and
on
november
15,
1968
before
the
10-day
period
specified
in
these
--
the
rules
of
this
court
and
this
was
the
first
time
that
i
heard
about
the
case
and
an
application
was
presented
to
the
chief
justice
to
extend
the
time
for
his
docketing
the
case.
actually,
our
application
asked
for
an
extension
until
january
31
which
was
based
upon
the
september
3
date
when
the
judgment
was
entered
in
the
court's
records
but
the
decision
of
the
court
was
on
august
29th
and
the
chief
justice
in
granting
the
extension
granted
it
to
and
including
january
26,
1969
which
was
the
90
days
plus
60
days
after
august
29
and
was
the
maximum
extension
that
could
be
obtained.
there
was
no
authority
to
grant
any
further
extension.
as
a
result
of
this
application
for
an
extension
of
time,
i
became
aware
of
the
case.
i
had
talks
with
members
of
my
staff.
i
read
the
prior
decisions
of
this
court
in
the
el
paso
case
and
the
cascade
case.
i
was
thoroughly
familiar
with
what
might
be
called
the
traumatic
experience
of
the
department
of
justice
and
the
cascade
case
and
knew
how
carefully
this
must
be
handled.
i
was
aware
too
of
the
interest
of
a
newspaper
columnist
in
the
matter.
it
would
have
been
and
easy
way
out
from
he
simply
to
have
said,
oh,
well
of
course
we
must
take
this
appeal.
in
due
course,
there
came
through
from
the
antitrust
division,
the
recommendations
with
respect
to
the
case.
mr.
zimmerman,
the
assistant
attorney
general
was
disqualified.
the
recommendation
came
from
the
deputy
assistant
attorney
general.
it
was
received
in
my
office
on
january
3,
1969.
by
that
time,
i
am
not
only
was
aware
of
the
case
but
i
was
aware
of
the
time
problem
involved
in
the
case
in
connection
with
the
change
of
administration
which
occurred
on
january
20th.
if
we
were
to
file
a
jurisdictional
statement
it
had
to
be
filed
by
january
26.
if
a
jurisdictional
statement
is
filed,
it
not
only
has
to
be
decided
upon,
it
has
to
be
written,
and
then
printed.
it
became
perfectly
apparent
that
there
was
no
prospect
that
such
a
decision
could
properly
be
made
by
the
administration
after
january
20th.
it
became
apparent
to
me
and
i
conclude
it
that
the
decision
would
have
to
be
made
before
january
20th.
the
recommendation
which
came
from
the
antitrust
division
was
comprehensive.
it
occupies
31
pages,
discusses
the
case
in
full
including
its
difficulties
and
the
recommendation
as
i
recommend,
no
direct
appeal.
he
then
went
to
a
member
of
my
staff
who
had
been
familiar
with
the
case
and
who
followed
it
and
who
wrote
a
memorandum
on
january
9
which
begins
somewhat
reluctantly.
i
concur
in
the
recommendation
of
antitrust
that
we
do
not
appeal
this
case
to
the
supreme
court.
on
the
following
day,
january
10th,
a
supplemental
memorandum
was
received
from
the
deputy
attorney
general
in
which
he
further
supported
the
recommendation
that
no
appeal
are
be
taken
and
on
the
same
day,
there
was
prepared
by
the
senior
member
of
my
staff
a
recommendation,
i
recommend
no
appeal.
i
can
--
took
all
of
these
memoranda.
i
studied
them
carefully;
i
found
the
question
a
very
difficult
one.
all
of
my
instincts
may
i
say
from
the
beginning
were
that
we
should
take
the
appeal
but
as
i
look
into
the
matter
i
found
more
and
more
difficulties.
in
the
process,
i
had
assigned
the
member
of
staff
who
had
said
somewhat
reluctantly,
i
concur
in
the
recommendation
for
no
appeal.
i
said,
you
make
a
skeleton,
an
outline
or
summary
of
what
a
jurisdictional
statement
would
look
like
and
he
did
that
and
he
have
presented
it
to
me
and
it
then
became
apparent
to
me
that
our
position
was
an
extremely
difficult
one.
in
the
process,
i
examined
the
briefs
which
the
department
of
justice
had
filed
in
the
district
court
in
this
case.
the
main
brief,
the
department
said
it
has
not
been
our
rule
in
these
proceedings
or
others
to
nominate
a
purchaser.
it
is
not
our
intent
now
to
intrude
in
any
way
upon
the
exercise
of
the
broad
discretion
of
this
equity
court
or
to
enter
upon
any
area
which
has
traditionally
been
the
court's
prerogative.
it
is
within
that
limitation
that
we
offer
the
comments
with
which
follow.
and
then
again
on
page
32
of
that
brief,
the
government
had
said
we
do
not
think
however
that
cig
should
be
automatically
excluded
from
consideration
here
because
it
is
now
a
potential
competitor
for
the
california
market.
if
the
combination
of
cig
and
the
new
company
were
to
create
a
considerably
stronger
competitor
for
the
california
market
then
either
one
could
possibly
be
alone,
the
court
could
validly
conclude
that
such
combination
is
pro-competitive
rather
than
anticompetitive
and
entirely
consistent
with
the
mandate
of
the
supreme
court.
and
then
later,
following
the
preliminary
decision
of
the
court,
the
department
of
justice
had
filed
a
final
memorandum
in
which
they
took
some
exception
to
the
fact
that
the
court's
findings
were
not
adequate
but
said,
while
we
do
not
flatly
oppose
the
court's
selection
of
cig,
we
do
submit
here
that
the
court
has
not
yet
made
findings
of
fact
in
conclusions
of
law
adequate
to
support
its
choice.
thus,
i
was
confronted
with
a
situation
where
i
would
have
to
--
mr.
irwin
n.
griswold
that
is
from
a
department
of
justice
of
the
united
states.
mr.
irwin
n.
griswold
the
antitrust
division,
yes
mr.
justice.
i
was
confronted
with
the
situation
where
i
would
have
to
file
a
jurisdictional
statement
saying
that
the
district
court
heard
because
it
had
decided
in
ways
which
the
department
of
justice
did
not
oppose.
now,
at
first
i
found
myself
somewhat
concerned
about
this.
the
more
i
thought
about
it,
the
more
it
seemed
to
me
that
maybe
the
handling
of
the
case
in
the
district
court
had
been
entirely
sound.
the
more
i
thought
about
it,
the
more
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
district
court
was
probably
correct
in
saying
that
cig
was
the
only
one
of
the
applicants
who
had
any
prospect
of
producing
an
effective
competitor
in
california
out
of
this
situation.
there
was
further
the
question
whether
this
wasn't
anticompetitive
and
that
there
might
have
been
two
competitors
if
pacific
northwest
was
transferred
to
another
company
and
cig
was
left
to
its
own
resources.
it
seemed
to
me
tolerably
clear
that
there
was
no
prospect
that
cig
by
itself
would
become
a
competitor
for
california.
there
was
little
prospect
that
pacific
northwest
transferred
to
another
company
would
become
a
competitor
for
california.
there's
been
reference
this
morning
to
the
embryonic
nature
of
this
other
companies.
it
seemed
apparent
that
all
or
nearly
all
of
them
were
speculative
ventures
which
were
organized
for
the
purpose
of
hoping
to
be
able
to
get
these
assets
and
then
on
them
to
being
able
to
realize
enough
money
to
develop
some
kind
of
a
structure
which
could
effectively
operate
in
the
gas
area.
but
these
other
companies
did
not
have
the
background
or
the
manpower
or
the
plans
to
operate
and
it
became
more
and
more
apparent
that
the
best
prospect
of
effective
competition
for
gas
in
california.
the
most
likely
way
to
carry
out
the
mandate
of
this
court
was
that
which
the
district
judge
had
head
upon
after
the
extensive
trial
and
that
it
may
well
have
been
that
the
most
helpful
thing
that
the
department
of
justice
could
do
with
respect
to
the
district
judge
was
to
raise
before
him
as
it
did.
the
varying
factors
which
more
upon
the
question
whether
colorado
interstate
or
one
of
the
other
companies
would
be
the
--
provide
the
most
effective
competition.
there
were
extensive
discussions
between
me
and
my
associates,
the
then
attorney
general
was
aware
of
the
situation
and
understood
that
the
decision
was
going
to
be
made
and
before
january
20th
we
were
aware
that
california
had
not
appealed
and
that
the
california
gas
companies
had
filed
the
motion
to
dismiss
and
the
antitrust
interest
was
essentially
in
california.
we
received
strong
representations
from
the
states
and
public
utility
commissions
in
the
northwest
that
it
would
gravely
hamper
their
interest
if
they
were
further
delay
and
that
an
appeal
was
taken.
and
finally
on
the
afternoon
of
friday,
january
17th
and
i
now
find
that
i
not
only
dated
that
january
17th,
i
wrote
5:30
p.m.
after
i
signed
a
slip
and
wrote
a
brief
memorandum
in
which
i
said,
no
appeal.
i
should
mention
too
that
the
deputy
clerk
of
the
court
had
issued
an
order
in
december
providing
that
our
time
for
filing
a
motion
to
dismiss
or
affirm
with
respect
to
any
appeals
that
might
be
taken
should
extend
for
a
period
of
30
days
from
the
filing
of
a
jurisdictional
statement
by
the
united
states
or
from
notice
by
the
united
states
that
their
appeal
will
not
be
perfected.
since
this
action
was
taken
late
on
friday
afternoon,
there
was
no
opportunity
to
give
notice
then.
monday
was
a
holiday
and
no
notice
was
given.
we
were
rather
anxious
to
keep
that
30-day
period
open
as
long
as
possible
in
order
that
the
new
assistant
attorney
general
might
have
an
opportunity
to
consider
what
position
should
be
taken
with
respect
to
a
motion
to
affirm.
it
was
--
there
have
been
some
suggestion
that
a
caller
in
my
office
on
tuesday
morning,
january
21st,
it
says
that
i
didn't
tell
him
that
we
had
decided
not
to
take
an
appeal
and
he
was
not
in
appropriate
person
to
be
notified,
he
was
not
a
party
or
counsel
in
the
case.
i
left
for
chicago
for
the
meeting
of
the
american
bar
association
on
the
afternoon
of
tuesday,
january
21st
and
on
january
23rd,
in
accordance
with
my
instructions
mr.
friedman,
the
deputy
solicitor
general,
sent
notice
to
all
counsel
in
the
case
that
the
government
would
not
have
perfect
its
appeal.
we
then
undertook
consideration
as
to
what
position
we
would
take
with
respect
to
the
appeal
taken
by
utah.
i
may
say
that
i
have
not
taken
utah's
appeal
very
seriously
into
account
in
determining
whether
we
would
perfect
our
appeal
or
not.
it
was
claimed
that
utah
had
no
interest
with
the
respect
to
california
that
its
interest
was
a
perfectly
legitimate
public
interest
but
a
very
narrow
one,
as
far
as
we
were
concerned,
i
felt
no
obligation
to
support
that.
we
worked
with
the
antitrust
division
on
the
draft
of
a
motion
which
we
concluded
should
be
a
motion
to
affirm.
this
was
approved
by
mr.
mclaren,
the
new
assistant
attorney
general.
in
its
final
draft,
i
approved
it
and
marked
it
to
go
to
the
printer
and
it
was
on
that
day
that
the
motion
to
dismiss
the
utah
appeal
was
filed.
we
understood
from
the
clerk's
office
that
a
motion
to
affirm
would
not
be
received
and
we
put
our
draft
in
our
file
and
did
not
file
it.
now,
when
the
court's
order
of,
we
could
go
yesterday
was
issued,
we
brought
it
out,
we
cause
it
to
be
printed
without
any
change,
without
bringing
it
down
to
date.
it
seemed
to
me
that
it
was
in
itself
a
document
of
records,
so
to
speak,
and
we
have
filed
that
as
an
appendix
to
the
response
which
we
have
made.
in
summary
then,
my
position
is
that
the
best
prospect,
the
most
likely
way
to
carry
out
this
court's
mandate
in
the
cascade
gas
case
is
the
one
which
has
been
adopted
by
the
district
court
in
this
decision
in
this
case
allocating
these
assets
to
colorado
interstate.
there
seems
to
be
a
considerably
--
a
considerable
likelihood
that
this
may
actually
develops
important
competition
with
respect
to
gas
in
california.
it
also
it
seems
to
me
that
this
was
not
anticompetitive
that
neither
colorado
interstate
nor
the
pacific
northwest
assets
in
the
hands
of
a
new
inexperience
company
were
likely
competitors
in
california.
in
my
view,
the
best
way
to
carryout
the
decision
of
this
court
in
cascade
is
to
dismiss
the
appeal
of
utah
and
let
the
decision
of
the
district
court
go
into
effect.
mr.
irwin
n.
griswold
you're
suggesting
mr.
justice
that
restores
these
two
basic
stronger
word?
mr.
irwin
n.
griswold
yes
mr.
justice,
that
is
in
procural
but
it's
a
forced
for
the
(voice
overlap).
mr.
irwin
n.
griswold
that
is
perfectly
true
mr.
justice,
i
cannot
guarantee
that
--
mr.
irwin
n.
griswold
grants
a
strong
likelihood
of
a
new
competitive
force
for
the
california
market.
i
think
might
be
more
--
mr.
irwin
n.
griswold
--
more
active.
mr.
irwin
n.
griswold
it
seems
to
me
a
greater
likelihood
than
any
other
prospect
that
was
available
to
the
district
court.
mr.
irwin
n.
griswold
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
response
to
the
court's
invitation,
i
have
filed
a
memorandum
on
behalf
of
the
united
states
and
which
we
say
that
we
have
no
objection
to
the
dismissal
of
utah's
appeal.
in
developing
the
reasons
which
lay
behind
the
position
of
the
united
states,
it
seems
to
me
that
it
maybe
helpful
to
summarize
the
process
by
which
they
were
determined.
in
this
case,
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
was
rendered
on
august
29,
1968.
at
that
time,
i
knew
nothing
about
the
case.
it
is
not
a
part
of
the
responsibility
of
the
solicitor
general
to
try
cases
in
the
district
court
and
the
trial
in
this
case
had
in
fact
begun
before
i
had
taken
public
office.
the
case
was
in
charge
of
the
antitrust
division
which
was
the
appropriate
place
for
it
to
be
handled
in
the
department
of
justice.
under
the
statute
and
rules,
the
notice
of
appeal
must
be
filed
within
60
days
after
the
judgment
was
entered.
that
expired
on
october
28,
1968
and
on
that
day
a
notice
of
appeal
was
filed.
i
knew
nothing
about
that,
made
no
authorization
of
it.
this
is
in
accordance
with
the
regular
departmental
practice.
it's
not
a
situation
that
i
particularly
like
but
neither
i
nor
my
predecessors
have
been
able
to
change
it
effectively.
the
practice
is
that
a
notice
of
appeal
is
more
or
less
automatically
filed
and
eventually
a
recommendation
comes
to
the
solicitor
general
if
he
decides
that
the
appeal
should
not
be
taken
then
the
appeal
is
not
perfected.
under
the
statute,
the
time
for
docketing
the
appeal
expired
90
days
after
the
judgment
was
entered.
that
would
have
been
november
28,
1968
and
on
november
15,
1968
before
the
10-day
period
specified
in
these
--
the
rules
of
this
court
and
this
was
the
first
time
that
i
heard
about
the
case
and
an
application
was
presented
to
the
chief
justice
to
extend
the
time
for
his
docketing
the
case.
actually,
our
application
asked
for
an
extension
until
january
31
which
was
based
upon
the
september
3
date
when
the
judgment
was
entered
in
the
court's
records
but
the
decision
of
the
court
was
on
august
29th
and
the
chief
justice
in
granting
the
extension
granted
it
to
and
including
january
26,
1969
which
was
the
90
days
plus
60
days
after
august
29
and
was
the
maximum
extension
that
could
be
obtained.
there
was
no
authority
to
grant
any
further
extension.
as
a
result
of
this
application
for
an
extension
of
time,
i
became
aware
of
the
case.
i
had
talks
with
members
of
my
staff.
i
read
the
prior
decisions
of
this
court
in
the
el
paso
case
and
the
cascade
case.
i
was
thoroughly
familiar
with
what
might
be
called
the
traumatic
experience
of
the
department
of
justice
and
the
cascade
case
and
knew
how
carefully
this
must
be
handled.
i
was
aware
too
of
the
interest
of
a
newspaper
columnist
in
the
matter.
it
would
have
been
and
easy
way
out
from
he
simply
to
have
said,
oh,
well
of
course
we
must
take
this
appeal.
in
due
course,
there
came
through
from
the
antitrust
division,
the
recommendations
with
respect
to
the
case.
mr.
zimmerman,
the
assistant
attorney
general
was
disqualified.
the
recommendation
came
from
the
deputy
assistant
attorney
general.
it
was
received
in
my
office
on
january
3,
1969.
by
that
time,
i
am
not
only
was
aware
of
the
case
but
i
was
aware
of
the
time
problem
involved
in
the
case
in
connection
with
the
change
of
administration
which
occurred
on
january
20th.
if
we
were
to
file
a
jurisdictional
statement
it
had
to
be
filed
by
january
26.
if
a
jurisdictional
statement
is
filed,
it
not
only
has
to
be
decided
upon,
it
has
to
be
written,
and
then
printed.
it
became
perfectly
apparent
that
there
was
no
prospect
that
such
a
decision
could
properly
be
made
by
the
administration
after
january
20th.
it
became
apparent
to
me
and
i
conclude
it
that
the
decision
would
have
to
be
made
before
january
20th.
the
recommendation
which
came
from
the
antitrust
division
was
comprehensive.
it
occupies
31
pages,
discusses
the
case
in
full
including
its
difficulties
and
the
recommendation
as
i
recommend,
no
direct
appeal.
he
then
went
to
a
member
of
my
staff
who
had
been
familiar
with
the
case
and
who
followed
it
and
who
wrote
a
memorandum
on
january
9
which
begins
somewhat
reluctantly.
i
concur
in
the
recommendation
of
antitrust
that
we
do
not
appeal
this
case
to
the
supreme
court.
on
the
following
day,
january
10th,
a
supplemental
memorandum
was
received
from
the
deputy
attorney
general
in
which
he
further
supported
the
recommendation
that
no
appeal
are
be
taken
and
on
the
same
day,
there
was
prepared
by
the
senior
member
of
my
staff
a
recommendation,
i
recommend
no
appeal.
i
can
--
took
all
of
these
memoranda.
i
studied
them
carefully;
i
found
the
question
a
very
difficult
one.
all
of
my
instincts
may
i
say
from
the
beginning
were
that
we
should
take
the
appeal
but
as
i
look
into
the
matter
i
found
more
and
more
difficulties.
in
the
process,
i
had
assigned
the
member
of
staff
who
had
said
somewhat
reluctantly,
i
concur
in
the
recommendation
for
no
appeal.
i
said,
you
make
a
skeleton,
an
outline
or
summary
of
what
a
jurisdictional
statement
would
look
like
and
he
did
that
and
he
have
presented
it
to
me
and
it
then
became
apparent
to
me
that
our
position
was
an
extremely
difficult
one.
in
the
process,
i
examined
the
briefs
which
the
department
of
justice
had
filed
in
the
district
court
in
this
case.
the
main
brief,
the
department
said
it
has
not
been
our
rule
in
these
proceedings
or
others
to
nominate
a
purchaser.
it
is
not
our
intent
now
to
intrude
in
any
way
upon
the
exercise
of
the
broad
discretion
of
this
equity
court
or
to
enter
upon
any
area
which
has
traditionally
been
the
court's
prerogative.
it
is
within
that
limitation
that
we
offer
the
comments
with
which
follow.
and
then
again
on
page
32
of
that
brief,
the
government
had
said
we
do
not
think
however
that
cig
should
be
automatically
excluded
from
consideration
here
because
it
is
now
a
potential
competitor
for
the
california
market.
if
the
combination
of
cig
and
the
new
company
were
to
create
a
considerably
stronger
competitor
for
the
california
market
then
either
one
could
possibly
be
alone,
the
court
could
validly
conclude
that
such
combination
is
pro-competitive
rather
than
anticompetitive
and
entirely
consistent
with
the
mandate
of
the
supreme
court.
and
then
later,
following
the
preliminary
decision
of
the
court,
the
department
of
justice
had
filed
a
final
memorandum
in
which
they
took
some
exception
to
the
fact
that
the
court's
findings
were
not
adequate
but
said,
while
we
do
not
flatly
oppose
the
court's
selection
of
cig,
we
do
submit
here
that
the
court
has
not
yet
made
findings
of
fact
in
conclusions
of
law
adequate
to
support
its
choice.
thus,
i
was
confronted
with
a
situation
where
i
would
have
to
--
mr.
irwin
n.
griswold
that
is
from
a
department
of
justice
of
the
united
states.
mr.
irwin
n.
griswold
the
antitrust
division,
yes
mr.
justice.
i
was
confronted
with
the
situation
where
i
would
have
to
file
a
jurisdictional
statement
saying
that
the
district
court
heard
because
it
had
decided
in
ways
which
the
department
of
justice
did
not
oppose.
now,
at
first
i
found
myself
somewhat
concerned
about
this.
the
more
i
thought
about
it,
the
more
it
seemed
to
me
that
maybe
the
handling
of
the
case
in
the
district
court
had
been
entirely
sound.
the
more
i
thought
about
it,
the
more
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
district
court
was
probably
correct
in
saying
that
cig
was
the
only
one
of
the
applicants
who
had
any
prospect
of
producing
an
effective
competitor
in
california
out
of
this
situation.
there
was
further
the
question
whether
this
wasn't
anticompetitive
and
that
there
might
have
been
two
competitors
if
pacific
northwest
was
transferred
to
another
company
and
cig
was
left
to
its
own
resources.
it
seemed
to
me
tolerably
clear
that
there
was
no
prospect
that
cig
by
itself
would
become
a
competitor
for
california.
there
was
little
prospect
that
pacific
northwest
transferred
to
another
company
would
become
a
competitor
for
california.
there's
been
reference
this
morning
to
the
embryonic
nature
of
this
other
companies.
it
seemed
apparent
that
all
or
nearly
all
of
them
were
speculative
ventures
which
were
organized
for
the
purpose
of
hoping
to
be
able
to
get
these
assets
and
then
on
them
to
being
able
to
realize
enough
money
to
develop
some
kind
of
a
structure
which
could
effectively
operate
in
the
gas
area.
but
these
other
companies
did
not
have
the
background
or
the
manpower
or
the
plans
to
operate
and
it
became
more
and
more
apparent
that
the
best
prospect
of
effective
competition
for
gas
in
california.
the
most
likely
way
to
carry
out
the
mandate
of
this
court
was
that
which
the
district
judge
had
head
upon
after
the
extensive
trial
and
that
it
may
well
have
been
that
the
most
helpful
thing
that
the
department
of
justice
could
do
with
respect
to
the
district
judge
was
to
raise
before
him
as
it
did.
the
varying
factors
which
more
upon
the
question
whether
colorado
interstate
or
one
of
the
other
companies
would
be
the
--
provide
the
most
effective
competition.
there
were
extensive
discussions
between
me
and
my
associates,
the
then
attorney
general
was
aware
of
the
situation
and
understood
that
the
decision
was
going
to
be
made
and
before
january
20th
we
were
aware
that
california
had
not
appealed
and
that
the
california
gas
companies
had
filed
the
motion
to
dismiss
and
the
antitrust
interest
was
essentially
in
california.
we
received
strong
representations
from
the
states
and
public
utility
commissions
in
the
northwest
that
it
would
gravely
hamper
their
interest
if
they
were
further
delay
and
that
an
appeal
was
taken.
and
finally
on
the
afternoon
of
friday,
january
17th
and
i
now
find
that
i
not
only
dated
that
january
17th,
i
wrote
5:30
p.m.
after
i
signed
a
slip
and
wrote
a
brief
memorandum
in
which
i
said,
no
appeal.
i
should
mention
too
that
the
deputy
clerk
of
the
court
had
issued
an
order
in
december
providing
that
our
time
for
filing
a
motion
to
dismiss
or
affirm
with
respect
to
any
appeals
that
might
be
taken
should
extend
for
a
period
of
30
days
from
the
filing
of
a
jurisdictional
statement
by
the
united
states
or
from
notice
by
the
united
states
that
their
appeal
will
not
be
perfected.
since
this
action
was
taken
late
on
friday
afternoon,
there
was
no
opportunity
to
give
notice
then.
monday
was
a
holiday
and
no
notice
was
given.
we
were
rather
anxious
to
keep
that
30-day
period
open
as
long
as
possible
in
order
that
the
new
assistant
attorney
general
might
have
an
opportunity
to
consider
what
position
should
be
taken
with
respect
to
a
motion
to
affirm.
it
was
--
there
have
been
some
suggestion
that
a
caller
in
my
office
on
tuesday
morning,
january
21st,
it
says
that
i
didn't
tell
him
that
we
had
decided
not
to
take
an
appeal
and
he
was
not
in
appropriate
person
to
be
notified,
he
was
not
a
party
or
counsel
in
the
case.
i
left
for
chicago
for
the
meeting
of
the
american
bar
association
on
the
afternoon
of
tuesday,
january
21st
and
on
january
23rd,
in
accordance
with
my
instructions
mr.
friedman,
the
deputy
solicitor
general,
sent
notice
to
all
counsel
in
the
case
that
the
government
would
not
have
perfect
its
appeal.
we
then
undertook
consideration
as
to
what
position
we
would
take
with
respect
to
the
appeal
taken
by
utah.
i
may
say
that
i
have
not
taken
utah's
appeal
very
seriously
into
account
in
determining
whether
we
would
perfect
our
appeal
or
not.
it
was
claimed
that
utah
had
no
interest
with
the
respect
to
california
that
its
interest
was
a
perfectly
legitimate
public
interest
but
a
very
narrow
one,
as
far
as
we
were
concerned,
i
felt
no
obligation
to
support
that.
we
worked
with
the
antitrust
division
on
the
draft
of
a
motion
which
we
concluded
should
be
a
motion
to
affirm.
this
was
approved
by
mr.
mclaren,
the
new
assistant
attorney
general.
in
its
final
draft,
i
approved
it
and
marked
it
to
go
to
the
printer
and
it
was
on
that
day
that
the
motion
to
dismiss
the
utah
appeal
was
filed.
we
understood
from
the
clerk's
office
that
a
motion
to
affirm
would
not
be
received
and
we
put
our
draft
in
our
file
and
did
not
file
it.
now,
when
the
court's
order
of,
we
could
go
yesterday
was
issued,
we
brought
it
out,
we
cause
it
to
be
printed
without
any
change,
without
bringing
it
down
to
date.
it
seemed
to
me
that
it
was
in
itself
a
document
of
records,
so
to
speak,
and
we
have
filed
that
as
an
appendix
to
the
response
which
we
have
made.
in
summary
then,
my
position
is
that
the
best
prospect,
the
most
likely
way
to
carry
out
this
court's
mandate
in
the
cascade
gas
case
is
the
one
which
has
been
adopted
by
the
district
court
in
this
decision
in
this
case
allocating
these
assets
to
colorado
interstate.
there
seems
to
be
a
considerably
--
a
considerable
likelihood
that
this
may
actually
develops
important
competition
with
respect
to
gas
in
california.
it
also
it
seems
to
me
that
this
was
not
anticompetitive
that
neither
colorado
interstate
nor
the
pacific
northwest
assets
in
the
hands
of
a
new
inexperience
company
were
likely
competitors
in
california.
in
my
view,
the
best
way
to
carryout
the
decision
of
this
court
in
cascade
is
to
dismiss
the
appeal
of
utah
and
let
the
decision
of
the
district
court
go
into
effect.
mr.
irwin
n.
griswold
you're
suggesting
mr.
justice
that
restores
these
two
basic
stronger
word?
mr.
irwin
n.
griswold
yes
mr.
justice,
that
is
in
procural
but
it's
a
forced
for
the
(voice
overlap).
mr.
irwin
n.
griswold
that
is
perfectly
true
mr.
justice,
i
cannot
guarantee
that
--
mr.
irwin
n.
griswold
grants
a
strong
likelihood
of
a
new
competitive
force
for
the
california
market.
i
think
might
be
more
--
mr.
irwin
n.
griswold
--
more
active.
mr.
irwin
n.
griswold
it
seems
to
me
a
greater
likelihood
than
any
other
prospect
that
was
available
to
the
district
court.
