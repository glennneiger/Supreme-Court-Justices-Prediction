mr.
william
m.
bennett
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
this
court,
i
think
it
would
be
refreshing
and
helpful
in
novel
here
today
to
speak
for
the
first
time
of
the
facts
of
the
case,
the
clayton
act,
the
sherman
act
and
your
decisions
and
to
judge
the
award
in
that
light
and
not
so
much
in
ad
hominem
argument.
and
to
understand
this
case
and
to
know
how
your
mandate
has
been
frustrated,
it
is
necessary
to
go
back
to
the
beginning
which
was
1956
when
there
was
the
possibility,
the
reality
as
you
found
in
el
paso
of
competition
to
california
from
the
northwest.
because
of
that
threat
of
competition,
el
paso
acquired
the
common
stock
of
pacific.
now,
what
is
relevant
to
these
proceedings
today
is
that
there
was
a
meeting
between
el
paso
and
the
attorney
general
of
united
states
in
1957
in
which
they
were
told
that
there
were
great
antitrust
consequences
in
their
action.
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
by
formal
letter
inquiry
pointed
out
the
antitrust
difficulties.
as
if
that
were
not
enough
on
july
27
--
july
7,
1957
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
filed
a
complaint
entitled
u.s.a.
versus
el
paso
charging
that
this
stock
acquisition
was
in
violation
of
section
7
of
the
clayton
act.
thereafter
on
august
22,
1957,
el
paso
went
to
the
power
commission
filed
an
application
there
for
asset
acquisition
and
approval
seeking
to
offset
the
effect
of
the
action
in
the
district
court
in
utah.
and
all
of
this
began
by
the
way
with
an
opinion
from
counsel
which
is
set
forth
in
a
prospectus
on
file
with
the
security
and
exchange
commission
in
1956
saying,
in
what
has
to
be
possibly
the
monumental
error
of
the
decade,
counsel
concludes
that
while
the
matter
is
not
entirely
free
from
doubt
it
is
their
opinion
that
the
proposed
transaction
is
not
in
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws.
thereafter,
commenced
proceedings
before
the
power
commission
in
which
i
participated
for
approximately
eight
weeks
and
in
that
proceeding
in
september
1958,
on
behalf
of
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
california,
i
filed
a
motion
to
stay
those
administrative
proceedings
pointing
out
that
it
was
fraud
with
danger
to
the
consumers
of
the
west
to
the
shareholders
of
el
paso
in
the
event
that
district
court
should
find
this
transaction
violated
section
7
of
the
clayton
act
which
it
did.
and
i
point
this
out
to
you
today
because
of
the
discussion
i
will
make
if
the
remedy
i
request
in
light
of
alleged
hardship
or
lack
of
notice
or
surprise
on
the
part
of
el
paso.
they
were
unnoticed
as
you
stated
in
el
paso
almost
from
the
beginning.
from
the
determination
by
the
power
commission
that
this
merger
was
lawful,
there
commenced
a
series
of
appeals
taken
by
california,
myself
having
the
honor
to
represent
that
state.
and
in
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
solicitor
general
lee
rankin
supported
our
cause
and
told
that
court
in
oral
argument
and
in
brief
that
this
merger
approval
by
the
power
commission
was
improper
so
long
as
there
was
a
pending
charge
in
the
district
court
in
utah.
thereafter,
came
the
appeal
to
this
court
in
which
the
new
solicitor
general
mr.
cox
upheld
that
fpc
approval
argued
against
california
but
you
found
that
the
federal
power
commission
could
not
approve
that
merger
so
long
as
there
was
a
charge
pending
in
utah.
now,
it
is
significant
to
note
that
justice
douglas
in
california
versus
the
federal
power
commission
had
this
to
say
about
the
approval
of
this
merger
by
that
administrative
agency.
there
are
practical
reasons
why
it
should
have
held
its
hand
until
the
courts
had
acted.
one
is
that
if
the
commission
approves
the
transaction
and
the
courts
in
the
antitrust
suit
later
hold
it
to
be
illegal
and
unscrambling
is
necessary.
thus,
a
needless
waste
of
time
and
money
may
be
involved
also
these
unscrambling
processes
often
raised
complicated
and
perplexing
problems
on
tax
matters
and
otherwise.
and
that
is
where
we
are
today.
following
that
determination
in
california
versus
the
power
commission,
we
tried
the
matter
before
judge
ritter
in
utah
who
held
there
was
no
violation
of
the
clayton
act.
there
came
then
the
appeal
to
this
court
and
i
might
add
after
great,
great
pleading
and
persuasions
of
department
of
justice
to
perfect
its
appeal
which
they
finally
did
almost
upon
a
request
made
on
bended
knees
so
to
speak.
and
in
that
case,
justice
douglas
pointed
out
having
found
the
violation
of
section
7
again
since
appellees
have
been
on
notice
of
the
antitrust
charge
from
almost
the
beginning
indeed
before
el
paso
sought
commission
approve
of
the
merger,
we
not
only
reverse
the
judgment
below
but
direct
the
district
court
to
order
divestiture
without
delay.
and
we
went
back
to
utah
and
we
have
the
proceedings
before
judge
ritter
in
which
i
participated
briefly
and
those
that
decree
there
in
my
judgment
did
not
comply
with
your
mandate
and
we
came
back
here
in
cascade.
and
now
we're
in
february
of
1967
and
in
cascade
you
said
it
is
now
nearly
three
years
later
and
as
we
shall
see
no
divestiture
in
any
meaningful
sense
has
been
directed.
and
you
said
again
that
mandate
in
the
context
of
the
opinion
claim
immense
that
pacific
northwest
or
a
new
company
be
at
once,
be
at
once
restored
to
a
position
where
it
could
compete
with
el
paso
in
the
california
market.
following
cascade,
we
went
back
to
salt
lake
city
and
ultimately
denver
before
judge
chilson,
i
participated
most
briefly.
i
was
a
member
of
the
public
utilities
commission
of
the
state
of
california.
my
primary
responsibility
was
there
not
my
unpaid
special
counsel
role
before
judge
chilson.
we
had
a
rush
of
rate
increases
in
california
and
still
have
because
of
certain
changes
which
have
occurred
in
my
native
state
and
my
presence
in
behalf
of
my
consumers
at
california
was
sorely
needed
there.
the
proceedings
before
judge
chilson
lasted
from
october
of
1967
to
march
21,
1968.
there
were
nine
applicants
for
acquisition.
the
department
of
justice
presented
no
testimony,
no
witnesses,
no
showing
whatsoever.
it
did
take
a
position.
its
position
was
quite
clear
for
the
most
part.
it
opposed
colorado
interstate
gas
company
as
an
applicant
and
as
i've
pointed
out
in
my
brief
according
to
brief
for
the
government,
it
said
it
would
lead
to
anticompetitive
consequences.
in
oral
argument
following
the
award,
the
award
to
cig
the
department
of
justice
through
mr.
dorothy
criticized
that
award
quite
clearly.
the
state
of
utah
strongly
criticized
that
award
in
a
brief
of
some
35
pages
but
which
it
details
its
objections
and
the
state
of
california
in
oral
argument
before
judge
chilson
concurred
in
the
utah
criticism.
i
have
the
transcript
here
in
which
the
california
attorney
general
said
with
respect
to
the
written
objections
filed
by
utah,
i
would
like
to
advise
the
court
that
we
are
convinced
that
they
are
well
taken
and
we
second
them.
and
utah's
position
was
quite
blunt.
they
said
in
writing
in
that
brief
and
orally
the
award
to
cig
violates
the
monopoly
lose.
thereafter,
in
support
of
those
objections
maybe
judge
chilson,
utah,
the
united
states
of
america
and
the
state
of
california
filed
appeals.
california
dismissed
first,
then
the
united
states
and
utah
is
asking
to
dismiss.
now,
so
far
as
utah
is
concerned
you
should
bear
in
mind
that
utah
in
its
jurisdictional
statement
has
told
you
that
the
questions
presented
are
so
substantial
as
to
require
plenary
consideration
and
then
the
brief
itself
submitted
by
utah
following
the
argument
under
that
topic
and
title
the
question
is
substantial.
utah
again
tells
you
the
questions
presented
are
substantial
and
are
entitled
to
plenary
consideration.
and
plenary
consideration
is
oppose
to
some
reconsideration
and
it
means
you
have
before
you
under
your
rule
15,
the
complete
right
to
give
a
complete
review
and
a
complete
decisions
since
utah
has
represented
to
you
as
a
sovereign
state
that
they
want
a
full
complete
review
of
the
matter
below.
that's
why
they
told
you
the
questions
are
substantial.
now,
you
should
also
bear
in
mind
in
reviewing
utah's
request
to
dismiss
the
consideration
for
the
dismissal
of
the
appeals
by
utah.
and
i
have
appended
in
the
brief
i
have
submitted
to
you
the
contract
between
the
governor
of
utah,
its
attorney
general,
its
regulatory
public
service
commission
and
the
colorado
interstate
gas
company.
and
it
is
quite
claim
and
stating
that
the
appeal
is
dismissed
in
consideration
of
substantial
bank
accounts
in
the
state
of
utah,
a
prominent
member
of
the
utah
community
on
the
board
of
directors
and
a
promise
to
purchase
steel
from
the
steel
mill
of
u.s.
steel
at
provo,
utah.
i
suggest
to
you
that
that
agreement
is
void
as
against
public
policy,
i
can't
conceive
of
myself
as
a
california
commissioner
entering
into
this
type
of
contract
for
the
el
paso
natural
gas
company.
i
submit
that
the
agreement
to
purchase
steel
from
but
one
mill
is
in
restraint
of
trade
and
as
to
the
directorship
all
i
can
say
about
that
is
there's
no
discernable
benefit
to
the
citizens
of
utah
so
far
as
that
is
concerned.
but
your
honors
you
have
before
you
an
appeal
by
a
sovereign
state
not
likely
taken
and
if
there
were
other
reasons
for
dismissal,
we
might
not
be
here
today.
but
the
clear
stated
reason
advanced
by
the
state
of
utah
for
dismissing
is
that
contract
whereby
these
types
of
dubious
considerations
are
forthcoming.
and
i've
suggest
to
you
that
this
court
is
being
used,
so
far
as
utah
is
concerned,
that
review
is
being
sought
to
be
denied
you
not
for
proper
public
causes
but
because
of
a
contract
of
this
nature
and
if
nothing
else
because
of
the
language
you
set
forth
in
dickson-yates.
this
should
be
condemned
for
what
it
is
an
abuse
of
your
process,
a
contract
against
public
policy
and
something
which
should
not
be
tolerated.
you
said
in
dickson-yates,
a
democracy
is
effective
only
if
the
people
have
faith
in
those
who
govern
and
that
faith
is
bound
to
be
shattered
when
higher
officials
and
their
appointees
engaged
in
activities
which
arouse
suspicions
of
malfeasance
and
corruption.
so
far
as
the
california
appeal
is
concerned
that
was
dismissed
by
an
agreement
between
the
california
utilities
and
colorado
interstate
gas
company.
i
have
read
it,
it
is
before
you.
it
is
a
collection
of
dubious,
illusory,
unenforceable
promises.
we
gave
up
something
for
nothing
and
i
might
ask
this,
if
the
decree
of
judge
chilson
is
so
sound.
why
must
it
be
implemented?
why
must
the
public
be
protected
by
a
contract?
isn't
a
judgment
of
the
united
states
district
court
adequate
so
far
as
that
is
concerned?
apparently
not.
now,
there's
another
thought
about
the
california
contract.
if
that
contract
is
a
binding
contract,
we
have
them
an
agreement
by
the
major
california
utilities
to
buy
the
next
block
of
gas
but
from
one
pipeline,
one
bidder,
one
competitor
and
possibly
that
itself
might
be
void
as
against
public
policy
or
some
kind
of
an
illegal
combination
or
restraint
of
trade.
now,
so
far
as
the
award
of
judge
chilson
is
concerned,
it
would
be
very
helpful
to
discuss
it
in
terms
of
the
clayton
act
and
the
sherman
act.
and
what
you
have
is
an
award
to
one
monopoly
of
another
monopoly.
colorado
interstate
gas
company
by
law
in
fact
is
a
regulated
natural
gas
company
a
monopoly.
pacific
northwest
pipeline
or
new
company
is
a
regulated
natural
gas
company
and
in
law
and
in
fact
a
monopoly.
this
award
gives
to
one
monopoly
another
monopoly
and
so
far
as
i
am
concerned
under
your
cases
and
the
language
of
clayton-sherman
is
a
per
se
violation
of
the
monopoly
law.
there
is
no
escaping
it.
it
is
as
though
to
breakup
general
motors
and
possibly
the
justice
department
by
way
of
example
might
be
looking
at
them.
we
were
to
give
general
motors
to
chrysler
there
to
compete
with
ford.
per
se
that
would
be
wrong
or
to
give
southern
pacific
to
union
pacific
to
compete
with
santa
fe
that
would
be
wrong
and
so
it
is
here.
your
language
in
el
paso
quite
clearly
covers
the
award
of
pacific
northwest
to
cig
because
just
as
it
was
wrong
to
give
pacific
northwest
pipeline
company
to
el
paso
in
1959
so
also
is
it
wrong
in
1969
to
give
to
colorado
interstate
gas
company
pacific
northwest
pipeline.
when
judge
ritter
announced
his
plan
of
divestiture
previously,
he
was
quite
candid
in
what
he
was
doing
and
in
speaking
of
the
proposal
which
he
had
authorized,
he
said
quite
clearly
you
see
what
this
plan
proposes
is
a
division
of
the
market,
a
division
of
the
resources
one
area
to
new
company
and
another
area
to
el
paso.
that's
what
the
root
of
this
plan
is
and
you
condemned
that
as
being
a
division
of
the
markets.
now,
judge
chilson
has
done
exactly
the
same
thing
only
he
has
failed
to
characterize
it
but
this
award
gives
to
the
north
--
to
colorado
interstate
gas
company
the
northwest
portion
of
the
united
states
and
it
gives
to
el
paso
the
southwest
portion
of
united
states.
it
is
literally
a
division
of
the
market.
it
cannot
stand
under
any
of
the
cases
which
this
court
has
decided
recently
under
u.s.a.
versus
el
paso,
under
cascade,
under
von's
grocery
company.
in
the
von's
grocery
case,
a
mere
7%
of
market
domination
was
condemned.
this
gives
to
colorado
interstate
100%
of
the
pipeline
capacity
the
northwest
not
7%,
100%.
under
the
du
pont
case,
that
stock
ownership
not
100%
was
struck
down.
here,
you
have
100%
stock
ownership
and
i
suggest
to
you
that
under
all
of
your
precedents,
under
clayton
from
a
literal
reading
and
under
sherman
itself
this
is
an
unlawful
award
on
its
face
--
on
its
face.
now,
let
us
assume
that
otherwise
the
award
to
colorado
interstate
would
be
valid.
that
award
is
still
deficient
in
this
respect.
you
said
repeatedly
that
divestiture
should
be
without
delay.
the
colorado
plan
contains
delay
simply
because
it
is
not
a
cash
sale.
and
the
fact
of
a
cash
sale
was
not
remote
even
to
the
trial
judge
because
in
his
findings
which
are
set
forth
on
page
102
of
utah's
statement.
we
find
the
court
saying
this,
the
alternative
methods
or
means
of
divestiture
available
to
the
court
are:
one,
cash
sale
not
two
or
three
or
four
but
cash
sale
the
first
thing
that
occurred
to
judge
chilson
then
he
says,
although
a
sale
of
assets
to
be
divested
for
cash
or
a
transfer
of
assets
to
a
new
company
in
the
sale
of
all
of
the
new
company
common
stock
for
each
would
effectively
accomplished
the
insulation
of
el
paso
from
control
of
the
divested
property
el
paso
would
suffer
adverse
tax
consequences.
now,
how
familiar
that
is
in
these
divestiture
proceedings.
that's
what
you
were
told
in
du
pont
and
justice
brennan
wasn't
persuaded
by
that
nor
was
this
court.
that's
what
you
were
told
in
the
present
case,
that's
what
you've
been
told
time
and
time
again
from
continental
on
forward
and
as
the
solicitor
general
of
the
united
states
said
to
you
in
his
brief
in
du
pont.
it
is
not
for
the
court's
to
be
concerned
about
the
national
tax
policy.
they're
not
to
device
remedies
to
avoid
tax
consequences
and
really
and
quite
bluntly
what
we're
talking
about
in
terms
of
hardship
because
there's
been
an
appreciation
assets
in
el
paso
just
as
the
rest
of
us
must,
must
pay
a
capital
gains
tax
the
public
interest
must
be
deferred
to
that
consideration.
the
payment
of
taxes,
onerous
still
they
may
be,
are
the
obligation
of
all
of
us
including
pipeline
corporations.
and
you
made
it
quite
claim
that
where
the
choice
is
between
hardship
and
private
injury
and
the
public
interest
and
relief
and
complete
divestiture
you
resolve
it
in
favor
of
the
public
interest
and
the
tax
consequences
must
be
suffered
by
the
private
interest
and
so
it
is
here
and
that
is
why
i
say
to
this
court,
since
you
met
without
delay
we
must
view
this
quite
simply.
if
i
am
compelled
to
divest
myself
of
my
house
and
home,
my
acreage
and
promptly
the
only
way
in
law
and
our
economic
system
i
know
to
accomplish
that
is
outright
sale.
not
a
lien,
not
a
mortgage,
not
some
type
of
security
encumbrance
but
an
outright
transfer
of
title
for
cash
consideration.
there's
nothing
in
the
laws
of
the
united
states
or
of
texas
or
the
rocky
mountain
states
which
prohibits
or
inhibits
a
sale
by
a
pipeline
company
of
its
properties
to
a
willing
third
party
purchaser
and
there
are
applicants
in
this
case
who
offered
cash,
a
cash
sale.
you
were
so
impressed
by
the
cash
sale
proposition
that
in
cascade
you
mentioned
the
fact
that
there
were
two
willing
cash
buyers.
you
referred
to
the
fact
in
cascade
that
if
that
time
the
department
of
justice
recommended
the
advisability
of
a
cash
sale.
and
it
seem
to
me
in
that
language
in
cascade
you
were
telling
the
lower
court,
judge
chilson
divest
promptly
do
it
by
a
cash
sale.
your
honors,
there
is
no
other
way
a
divestiture
maybe
accomplished
without
delay
especially
this
one
after
11
long
years
unless
it's
an
outright
cash
sale
and
pacific
western
in
this
case,
an
applicant,
offered
a
cash
sale
and
paradox
production
properties
offered
a
cash
sale,
an
outright
purchase
of
the
equity
now
and
a
transfer
of
the
title
of
the
assets
immediately.
that
would
be
without
delay,
not
the
plan
of
colorado
interstate
gas
company.
other
things
must
be
said
so
far
as
colorado
interstate
is
concerned.
for
40
years,
they
have
been
in
business
in
the
rocky
mountain
area
as
a
pipeline
corporation
and
never
ever
once
attempted
to
compete
for
the
great
golden
gas
market
which
is
california.
it's
almost
a
natural
thing
so
to
do
when
a
pipeline
business
but
never
wants
that
colorado
look
west
to
california.
no
record
whatsoever
of
competition.
now,
so
far
as
remedy
is
concern
your
honors,
i
have
pointed
out
that
the
public
interest
is
paramount
in
the
private
interest
are
secondary
and
i
have
emphasized
to
you
that
el
paso
has
known
even
before
formal
proceedings
going
back
as
far
as
1956
and
1957
that
there
would
be
a
day
of
reckoning.
and
the
only
way
in
which
there
can
be
meaning
to
the
antitrust
laws,
the
only
way
the
integrity
of
your
mandate
may
be
respected
is
by
a
divestiture
at
once
without
delay
and
so
far
as
i
am
concerned
by
cash
sale.
now,
counsel
for
el
paso
presented
a
case
of
corporate
hardship
in
terms
of
the
terrible
burdens
attacked
to
endure
by
virtue
of
acquired
and
unlawful
asset.
let
me
point
this
out,
el
paso
has
had
the
income
from
the
northwest
system
ever
since
state
of
acquisition
and
more
than
that
el
paso
was
had
the
benefit
of
no
competition
because
of
an
acquisition.
and
the
divestiture
plan
of
el
paso
filed
on
august
4,
1967
in
tab
13
thereof,
points
out
from
their
figures
that
the
net
income
from
the
northwest
system
for
the
calendar
year
1968
is
going
to
be
and
was
$8,092,000.00.
that's
$8
million
net
income
by
a
virtue
of
having
violated
the
clayton
act.
in
addition
to
that,
there
is
cash
flow
from
depreciation,
depletion
and
amortization
of
$10,123,000.00
or
in
short
a
cash
flow
of
$18
million
and
that
can
hardly
be
described
as
a
penalty
for
violating
the
clayton
act.
it
is
a
bonus.
now,
there's
a
certain
detriment
to
the
bonus,
i
assume
on
it
they
will
have
to
pay
federal
income
taxes
but
other
than
that
it
is
free
and
clear.
and
so
i
would
say
to
you
that
since
el
paso
has
known
ever
since
california
versus
fpc
in
1962,
what
might
occur
to
it,
and
i'm
sure
that
they
read
du
pont
and
all
those
other
cases,
you
should
make
the
monopoly
laws
effective
by
taking
the
bonus
out
of
violation.
and
not
only
should
all
of
the
properties
go
back,
all
of
them
are
not
exception,
but
as
well
the
income
from
those
properties
commencing
with
california
versus
the
federal
power
commission.
now,
if
that
seems
too
harsh,
you
then
at
the
very
least
should
begin
in
the
year
1964,
i
believe
it
is
when
in
u.s.a.
versus
el
paso
you
pronounced
a
clear
violation
of
section
7
of
the
clayton
act.
certainly
as
of
april
6,
1964,
el
paso
knew
from
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
that
the
continued
operation
of
the
northwest
division
was
in
violation
of
the
clayton
act.
and
we
must
bear
in
mind
that
but
for
the
acquisition
of
northwest
by
el
paso
that
same
income
would
be
going
to
pacific
northwest
pipeline
and
so
far
as
i
am
concern
in
my
judgment
with
that
income
that
pipeline
would
be
in
the
california
gas
market
today.
now,
i
do
not
say
this
lightly
i
ask
you
to
view
this
case
lasting
more
than
a
decade,
i
asked
you
to
view
the
deliberate
calculated
violation
by
el
paso.
these
are
not
crimes
of
passion.
these
are
knowing-calculated
acts
of
corporations
through
officers
indulged
in
pursuant
to
legal
opinion,
meetings,
authorizations
of
directors
and
all
those
myriad
of
detail
steps
which
must
be
gone
through
before
a
corporation
decides
to
violate
the
clayton
act.
and
if
you
fail
to
do
something
of
this
nature,
then
what
you
were
saying
is
that
the
clayton
act
is
there
and
the
divestiture
is
there
but
in
terms
of
taking
the
profit
of
law
violation
we
know
of
no
way
to
do
it
and
the
reference
i
made
in
the
brief
to
the
article
in
that
publication
entitled
“antitrust
law
and
economics
review”
by
a
dr.
kenneth
g.
elzinga
has
a
study
therein
of
the
unlawful
acquisitions
over
the
past
few
years
pointing
out
that
in
each
and
everyone
of
them
there
was
a
purchase
in
one
year
for
a
certain
dollar
figure,
there
was
a
divestiture
three
or
four
years
later
and
a
great
increase
in
property
value,
a
great
increase
in
profit
to
the
corporation
as
well
as
the
unlawful
income
in
the
interim.
now,
if
the
monopoly
laws
are
to
be
meaningful,
this
is
the
remedy
which
must
be
imposed.
it
is
not
harsh
particularly
in
this
case
where
they
have
been
on
notice
as
you
yourself
said
almost
from
the
very
beginning.
now,
your
honors
there's
something
which
must
be
discussed
here
about
this
case
and
your
mandate
and
that
is
the
history
of
it,
the
frustrations
of
it,
the
delays
of
it.
when
i
come
here
sometimes,
it
occurs
to
me
that
you
only
see
the
top
of
the
iceberg
and
that
we're
here
simply
because
we
filed
the
proper
pleadings.
i
come
before
you,
address
you
and
then
leave.
but
this
case
represents
an
abuse
of
the
economic
and
therefore
the
political
power
of
the
world's
first
natural
gas
pipeline
company.
the
very
appeal
i
took
to
you
in
california
versus
fpc
was
made
below
on
the
60th
and
last
day.
why?
because
of
the
great
influence
of
el
paso
in
my
state
persuading
public
officials
there
should
be
no
appeal
and
but
for
the
perseverance
we
would
never
had
california
versus
fpc
and
we
would
never
but
for
that
case
have
had
returned
to
our
state
$155
million
by
way
of
refund.
the
same
with
u.s.a.
versus
el
paso
again,
all
of
the
forces
they
can
bear
to
persuade
public
officials
not
to
pursue
proper
appeals
before
this
or
other
courts.
the
appeal
which
is
symbolized
in
your
decision
known
as
cascade
was
preceded
by
a
deliberate,
public,
calculated
attempt
by
the
attorney
for
el
paso
to
remove
me,
a
public
official
from
the
case
and
as
the
record
before
you
shows,
they
almost
succeeded.
they
did
succeed
in
getting
oregon
to
drop
its
appeal.
by
telling
oregon,
no
more
gas
the
other
side
of
the
columbia.
and
so
it
is
with
the
case
here
today.
these
appeals
of
the
parties
were
not
dropped
so
far
as
i
am
concern
for
any
proper
considerations
but
for
agreements
which
are
highly
suspect
and
they
involved
not
just
california,
not
just
utah,
not
the
west
but
the
integrity
of
government
and
of
this
court
itself.
this
court
if
it
drops
the
utah
appeal
is
being
used
by
the
parties
and
the
instrument
is
that
suspect
agreement.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
in
view
of
all
i've
said
about
the
time,
the
delay,
the
contracts,
the
dubious
arrangements
that
this
is
one
case
in
which
the
court
should
be
quite
severe
in
its
judgment
should
be
quite
prompt
in
ordering
divestiture
and
should
take
the
profit
out
of
monopoly
law
violation
by
removing
from
el
paso
all
of
the
profits
since
the
decision
of
this
court
in
u.s.a.
versus
el
paso.
your
honors,
i
have
another
30
minutes.
i
have
completed
my
argument,
if
you
have
questions
i
would
be
happy
to
answer
them
but
other
than
that
i
feel
i've
completed
what
i
have
to
say
here
today.
there's
one
last
thing
i
would
like
to
say
mr.
chief
justice
then.
i've
been
here
on
many
occasions
for
over
a
decade
and
i
can
only
speak
for
myself
and
i
think
my
family
but
i
think
i
speak
for
a
great,
great
many
other
americans.
we
are
grateful
to
the
supreme
court
of
united
states
under
chief
justice
warren
and
i
think
our
children
will
long
remember
all
we've
done
for
us
and
the
greatest
honor
i've
had
as
a
lawyer
is
to
have
appeared
in
the
time
of
the
warren
court
to
address
you.
thank
you.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
this
court,
i
think
it
would
be
refreshing
and
helpful
in
novel
here
today
to
speak
for
the
first
time
of
the
facts
of
the
case,
the
clayton
act,
the
sherman
act
and
your
decisions
and
to
judge
the
award
in
that
light
and
not
so
much
in
ad
hominem
argument.
and
to
understand
this
case
and
to
know
how
your
mandate
has
been
frustrated,
it
is
necessary
to
go
back
to
the
beginning
which
was
1956
when
there
was
the
possibility,
the
reality
as
you
found
in
el
paso
of
competition
to
california
from
the
northwest.
because
of
that
threat
of
competition,
el
paso
acquired
the
common
stock
of
pacific.
now,
what
is
relevant
to
these
proceedings
today
is
that
there
was
a
meeting
between
el
paso
and
the
attorney
general
of
united
states
in
1957
in
which
they
were
told
that
there
were
great
antitrust
consequences
in
their
action.
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
by
formal
letter
inquiry
pointed
out
the
antitrust
difficulties.
as
if
that
were
not
enough
on
july
27
--
july
7,
1957
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
filed
a
complaint
entitled
u.s.a.
versus
el
paso
charging
that
this
stock
acquisition
was
in
violation
of
section
7
of
the
clayton
act.
thereafter
on
august
22,
1957,
el
paso
went
to
the
power
commission
filed
an
application
there
for
asset
acquisition
and
approval
seeking
to
offset
the
effect
of
the
action
in
the
district
court
in
utah.
and
all
of
this
began
by
the
way
with
an
opinion
from
counsel
which
is
set
forth
in
a
prospectus
on
file
with
the
security
and
exchange
commission
in
1956
saying,
in
what
has
to
be
possibly
the
monumental
error
of
the
decade,
counsel
concludes
that
while
the
matter
is
not
entirely
free
from
doubt
it
is
their
opinion
that
the
proposed
transaction
is
not
in
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws.
thereafter,
commenced
proceedings
before
the
power
commission
in
which
i
participated
for
approximately
eight
weeks
and
in
that
proceeding
in
september
1958,
on
behalf
of
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
california,
i
filed
a
motion
to
stay
those
administrative
proceedings
pointing
out
that
it
was
fraud
with
danger
to
the
consumers
of
the
west
to
the
shareholders
of
el
paso
in
the
event
that
district
court
should
find
this
transaction
violated
section
7
of
the
clayton
act
which
it
did.
and
i
point
this
out
to
you
today
because
of
the
discussion
i
will
make
if
the
remedy
i
request
in
light
of
alleged
hardship
or
lack
of
notice
or
surprise
on
the
part
of
el
paso.
they
were
unnoticed
as
you
stated
in
el
paso
almost
from
the
beginning.
from
the
determination
by
the
power
commission
that
this
merger
was
lawful,
there
commenced
a
series
of
appeals
taken
by
california,
myself
having
the
honor
to
represent
that
state.
and
in
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
solicitor
general
lee
rankin
supported
our
cause
and
told
that
court
in
oral
argument
and
in
brief
that
this
merger
approval
by
the
power
commission
was
improper
so
long
as
there
was
a
pending
charge
in
the
district
court
in
utah.
thereafter,
came
the
appeal
to
this
court
in
which
the
new
solicitor
general
mr.
cox
upheld
that
fpc
approval
argued
against
california
but
you
found
that
the
federal
power
commission
could
not
approve
that
merger
so
long
as
there
was
a
charge
pending
in
utah.
now,
it
is
significant
to
note
that
justice
douglas
in
california
versus
the
federal
power
commission
had
this
to
say
about
the
approval
of
this
merger
by
that
administrative
agency.
there
are
practical
reasons
why
it
should
have
held
its
hand
until
the
courts
had
acted.
one
is
that
if
the
commission
approves
the
transaction
and
the
courts
in
the
antitrust
suit
later
hold
it
to
be
illegal
and
unscrambling
is
necessary.
thus,
a
needless
waste
of
time
and
money
may
be
involved
also
these
unscrambling
processes
often
raised
complicated
and
perplexing
problems
on
tax
matters
and
otherwise.
and
that
is
where
we
are
today.
following
that
determination
in
california
versus
the
power
commission,
we
tried
the
matter
before
judge
ritter
in
utah
who
held
there
was
no
violation
of
the
clayton
act.
there
came
then
the
appeal
to
this
court
and
i
might
add
after
great,
great
pleading
and
persuasions
of
department
of
justice
to
perfect
its
appeal
which
they
finally
did
almost
upon
a
request
made
on
bended
knees
so
to
speak.
and
in
that
case,
justice
douglas
pointed
out
having
found
the
violation
of
section
7
again
since
appellees
have
been
on
notice
of
the
antitrust
charge
from
almost
the
beginning
indeed
before
el
paso
sought
commission
approve
of
the
merger,
we
not
only
reverse
the
judgment
below
but
direct
the
district
court
to
order
divestiture
without
delay.
and
we
went
back
to
utah
and
we
have
the
proceedings
before
judge
ritter
in
which
i
participated
briefly
and
those
that
decree
there
in
my
judgment
did
not
comply
with
your
mandate
and
we
came
back
here
in
cascade.
and
now
we're
in
february
of
1967
and
in
cascade
you
said
it
is
now
nearly
three
years
later
and
as
we
shall
see
no
divestiture
in
any
meaningful
sense
has
been
directed.
and
you
said
again
that
mandate
in
the
context
of
the
opinion
claim
immense
that
pacific
northwest
or
a
new
company
be
at
once,
be
at
once
restored
to
a
position
where
it
could
compete
with
el
paso
in
the
california
market.
following
cascade,
we
went
back
to
salt
lake
city
and
ultimately
denver
before
judge
chilson,
i
participated
most
briefly.
i
was
a
member
of
the
public
utilities
commission
of
the
state
of
california.
my
primary
responsibility
was
there
not
my
unpaid
special
counsel
role
before
judge
chilson.
we
had
a
rush
of
rate
increases
in
california
and
still
have
because
of
certain
changes
which
have
occurred
in
my
native
state
and
my
presence
in
behalf
of
my
consumers
at
california
was
sorely
needed
there.
the
proceedings
before
judge
chilson
lasted
from
october
of
1967
to
march
21,
1968.
there
were
nine
applicants
for
acquisition.
the
department
of
justice
presented
no
testimony,
no
witnesses,
no
showing
whatsoever.
it
did
take
a
position.
its
position
was
quite
clear
for
the
most
part.
it
opposed
colorado
interstate
gas
company
as
an
applicant
and
as
i've
pointed
out
in
my
brief
according
to
brief
for
the
government,
it
said
it
would
lead
to
anticompetitive
consequences.
in
oral
argument
following
the
award,
the
award
to
cig
the
department
of
justice
through
mr.
dorothy
criticized
that
award
quite
clearly.
the
state
of
utah
strongly
criticized
that
award
in
a
brief
of
some
35
pages
but
which
it
details
its
objections
and
the
state
of
california
in
oral
argument
before
judge
chilson
concurred
in
the
utah
criticism.
i
have
the
transcript
here
in
which
the
california
attorney
general
said
with
respect
to
the
written
objections
filed
by
utah,
i
would
like
to
advise
the
court
that
we
are
convinced
that
they
are
well
taken
and
we
second
them.
and
utah's
position
was
quite
blunt.
they
said
in
writing
in
that
brief
and
orally
the
award
to
cig
violates
the
monopoly
lose.
thereafter,
in
support
of
those
objections
maybe
judge
chilson,
utah,
the
united
states
of
america
and
the
state
of
california
filed
appeals.
california
dismissed
first,
then
the
united
states
and
utah
is
asking
to
dismiss.
now,
so
far
as
utah
is
concerned
you
should
bear
in
mind
that
utah
in
its
jurisdictional
statement
has
told
you
that
the
questions
presented
are
so
substantial
as
to
require
plenary
consideration
and
then
the
brief
itself
submitted
by
utah
following
the
argument
under
that
topic
and
title
the
question
is
substantial.
utah
again
tells
you
the
questions
presented
are
substantial
and
are
entitled
to
plenary
consideration.
and
plenary
consideration
is
oppose
to
some
reconsideration
and
it
means
you
have
before
you
under
your
rule
15,
the
complete
right
to
give
a
complete
review
and
a
complete
decisions
since
utah
has
represented
to
you
as
a
sovereign
state
that
they
want
a
full
complete
review
of
the
matter
below.
that's
why
they
told
you
the
questions
are
substantial.
now,
you
should
also
bear
in
mind
in
reviewing
utah's
request
to
dismiss
the
consideration
for
the
dismissal
of
the
appeals
by
utah.
and
i
have
appended
in
the
brief
i
have
submitted
to
you
the
contract
between
the
governor
of
utah,
its
attorney
general,
its
regulatory
public
service
commission
and
the
colorado
interstate
gas
company.
and
it
is
quite
claim
and
stating
that
the
appeal
is
dismissed
in
consideration
of
substantial
bank
accounts
in
the
state
of
utah,
a
prominent
member
of
the
utah
community
on
the
board
of
directors
and
a
promise
to
purchase
steel
from
the
steel
mill
of
u.s.
steel
at
provo,
utah.
i
suggest
to
you
that
that
agreement
is
void
as
against
public
policy,
i
can't
conceive
of
myself
as
a
california
commissioner
entering
into
this
type
of
contract
for
the
el
paso
natural
gas
company.
i
submit
that
the
agreement
to
purchase
steel
from
but
one
mill
is
in
restraint
of
trade
and
as
to
the
directorship
all
i
can
say
about
that
is
there's
no
discernable
benefit
to
the
citizens
of
utah
so
far
as
that
is
concerned.
but
your
honors
you
have
before
you
an
appeal
by
a
sovereign
state
not
likely
taken
and
if
there
were
other
reasons
for
dismissal,
we
might
not
be
here
today.
but
the
clear
stated
reason
advanced
by
the
state
of
utah
for
dismissing
is
that
contract
whereby
these
types
of
dubious
considerations
are
forthcoming.
and
i've
suggest
to
you
that
this
court
is
being
used,
so
far
as
utah
is
concerned,
that
review
is
being
sought
to
be
denied
you
not
for
proper
public
causes
but
because
of
a
contract
of
this
nature
and
if
nothing
else
because
of
the
language
you
set
forth
in
dickson-yates.
this
should
be
condemned
for
what
it
is
an
abuse
of
your
process,
a
contract
against
public
policy
and
something
which
should
not
be
tolerated.
you
said
in
dickson-yates,
a
democracy
is
effective
only
if
the
people
have
faith
in
those
who
govern
and
that
faith
is
bound
to
be
shattered
when
higher
officials
and
their
appointees
engaged
in
activities
which
arouse
suspicions
of
malfeasance
and
corruption.
so
far
as
the
california
appeal
is
concerned
that
was
dismissed
by
an
agreement
between
the
california
utilities
and
colorado
interstate
gas
company.
i
have
read
it,
it
is
before
you.
it
is
a
collection
of
dubious,
illusory,
unenforceable
promises.
we
gave
up
something
for
nothing
and
i
might
ask
this,
if
the
decree
of
judge
chilson
is
so
sound.
why
must
it
be
implemented?
why
must
the
public
be
protected
by
a
contract?
isn't
a
judgment
of
the
united
states
district
court
adequate
so
far
as
that
is
concerned?
apparently
not.
now,
there's
another
thought
about
the
california
contract.
if
that
contract
is
a
binding
contract,
we
have
them
an
agreement
by
the
major
california
utilities
to
buy
the
next
block
of
gas
but
from
one
pipeline,
one
bidder,
one
competitor
and
possibly
that
itself
might
be
void
as
against
public
policy
or
some
kind
of
an
illegal
combination
or
restraint
of
trade.
now,
so
far
as
the
award
of
judge
chilson
is
concerned,
it
would
be
very
helpful
to
discuss
it
in
terms
of
the
clayton
act
and
the
sherman
act.
and
what
you
have
is
an
award
to
one
monopoly
of
another
monopoly.
colorado
interstate
gas
company
by
law
in
fact
is
a
regulated
natural
gas
company
a
monopoly.
pacific
northwest
pipeline
or
new
company
is
a
regulated
natural
gas
company
and
in
law
and
in
fact
a
monopoly.
this
award
gives
to
one
monopoly
another
monopoly
and
so
far
as
i
am
concerned
under
your
cases
and
the
language
of
clayton-sherman
is
a
per
se
violation
of
the
monopoly
law.
there
is
no
escaping
it.
it
is
as
though
to
breakup
general
motors
and
possibly
the
justice
department
by
way
of
example
might
be
looking
at
them.
we
were
to
give
general
motors
to
chrysler
there
to
compete
with
ford.
per
se
that
would
be
wrong
or
to
give
southern
pacific
to
union
pacific
to
compete
with
santa
fe
that
would
be
wrong
and
so
it
is
here.
your
language
in
el
paso
quite
clearly
covers
the
award
of
pacific
northwest
to
cig
because
just
as
it
was
wrong
to
give
pacific
northwest
pipeline
company
to
el
paso
in
1959
so
also
is
it
wrong
in
1969
to
give
to
colorado
interstate
gas
company
pacific
northwest
pipeline.
when
judge
ritter
announced
his
plan
of
divestiture
previously,
he
was
quite
candid
in
what
he
was
doing
and
in
speaking
of
the
proposal
which
he
had
authorized,
he
said
quite
clearly
you
see
what
this
plan
proposes
is
a
division
of
the
market,
a
division
of
the
resources
one
area
to
new
company
and
another
area
to
el
paso.
that's
what
the
root
of
this
plan
is
and
you
condemned
that
as
being
a
division
of
the
markets.
now,
judge
chilson
has
done
exactly
the
same
thing
only
he
has
failed
to
characterize
it
but
this
award
gives
to
the
north
--
to
colorado
interstate
gas
company
the
northwest
portion
of
the
united
states
and
it
gives
to
el
paso
the
southwest
portion
of
united
states.
it
is
literally
a
division
of
the
market.
it
cannot
stand
under
any
of
the
cases
which
this
court
has
decided
recently
under
u.s.a.
versus
el
paso,
under
cascade,
under
von's
grocery
company.
in
the
von's
grocery
case,
a
mere
7%
of
market
domination
was
condemned.
this
gives
to
colorado
interstate
100%
of
the
pipeline
capacity
the
northwest
not
7%,
100%.
under
the
du
pont
case,
that
stock
ownership
not
100%
was
struck
down.
here,
you
have
100%
stock
ownership
and
i
suggest
to
you
that
under
all
of
your
precedents,
under
clayton
from
a
literal
reading
and
under
sherman
itself
this
is
an
unlawful
award
on
its
face
--
on
its
face.
now,
let
us
assume
that
otherwise
the
award
to
colorado
interstate
would
be
valid.
that
award
is
still
deficient
in
this
respect.
you
said
repeatedly
that
divestiture
should
be
without
delay.
the
colorado
plan
contains
delay
simply
because
it
is
not
a
cash
sale.
and
the
fact
of
a
cash
sale
was
not
remote
even
to
the
trial
judge
because
in
his
findings
which
are
set
forth
on
page
102
of
utah's
statement.
we
find
the
court
saying
this,
the
alternative
methods
or
means
of
divestiture
available
to
the
court
are:
one,
cash
sale
not
two
or
three
or
four
but
cash
sale
the
first
thing
that
occurred
to
judge
chilson
then
he
says,
although
a
sale
of
assets
to
be
divested
for
cash
or
a
transfer
of
assets
to
a
new
company
in
the
sale
of
all
of
the
new
company
common
stock
for
each
would
effectively
accomplished
the
insulation
of
el
paso
from
control
of
the
divested
property
el
paso
would
suffer
adverse
tax
consequences.
now,
how
familiar
that
is
in
these
divestiture
proceedings.
that's
what
you
were
told
in
du
pont
and
justice
brennan
wasn't
persuaded
by
that
nor
was
this
court.
that's
what
you
were
told
in
the
present
case,
that's
what
you've
been
told
time
and
time
again
from
continental
on
forward
and
as
the
solicitor
general
of
the
united
states
said
to
you
in
his
brief
in
du
pont.
it
is
not
for
the
court's
to
be
concerned
about
the
national
tax
policy.
they're
not
to
device
remedies
to
avoid
tax
consequences
and
really
and
quite
bluntly
what
we're
talking
about
in
terms
of
hardship
because
there's
been
an
appreciation
assets
in
el
paso
just
as
the
rest
of
us
must,
must
pay
a
capital
gains
tax
the
public
interest
must
be
deferred
to
that
consideration.
the
payment
of
taxes,
onerous
still
they
may
be,
are
the
obligation
of
all
of
us
including
pipeline
corporations.
and
you
made
it
quite
claim
that
where
the
choice
is
between
hardship
and
private
injury
and
the
public
interest
and
relief
and
complete
divestiture
you
resolve
it
in
favor
of
the
public
interest
and
the
tax
consequences
must
be
suffered
by
the
private
interest
and
so
it
is
here
and
that
is
why
i
say
to
this
court,
since
you
met
without
delay
we
must
view
this
quite
simply.
if
i
am
compelled
to
divest
myself
of
my
house
and
home,
my
acreage
and
promptly
the
only
way
in
law
and
our
economic
system
i
know
to
accomplish
that
is
outright
sale.
not
a
lien,
not
a
mortgage,
not
some
type
of
security
encumbrance
but
an
outright
transfer
of
title
for
cash
consideration.
there's
nothing
in
the
laws
of
the
united
states
or
of
texas
or
the
rocky
mountain
states
which
prohibits
or
inhibits
a
sale
by
a
pipeline
company
of
its
properties
to
a
willing
third
party
purchaser
and
there
are
applicants
in
this
case
who
offered
cash,
a
cash
sale.
you
were
so
impressed
by
the
cash
sale
proposition
that
in
cascade
you
mentioned
the
fact
that
there
were
two
willing
cash
buyers.
you
referred
to
the
fact
in
cascade
that
if
that
time
the
department
of
justice
recommended
the
advisability
of
a
cash
sale.
and
it
seem
to
me
in
that
language
in
cascade
you
were
telling
the
lower
court,
judge
chilson
divest
promptly
do
it
by
a
cash
sale.
your
honors,
there
is
no
other
way
a
divestiture
maybe
accomplished
without
delay
especially
this
one
after
11
long
years
unless
it's
an
outright
cash
sale
and
pacific
western
in
this
case,
an
applicant,
offered
a
cash
sale
and
paradox
production
properties
offered
a
cash
sale,
an
outright
purchase
of
the
equity
now
and
a
transfer
of
the
title
of
the
assets
immediately.
that
would
be
without
delay,
not
the
plan
of
colorado
interstate
gas
company.
other
things
must
be
said
so
far
as
colorado
interstate
is
concerned.
for
40
years,
they
have
been
in
business
in
the
rocky
mountain
area
as
a
pipeline
corporation
and
never
ever
once
attempted
to
compete
for
the
great
golden
gas
market
which
is
california.
it's
almost
a
natural
thing
so
to
do
when
a
pipeline
business
but
never
wants
that
colorado
look
west
to
california.
no
record
whatsoever
of
competition.
now,
so
far
as
remedy
is
concern
your
honors,
i
have
pointed
out
that
the
public
interest
is
paramount
in
the
private
interest
are
secondary
and
i
have
emphasized
to
you
that
el
paso
has
known
even
before
formal
proceedings
going
back
as
far
as
1956
and
1957
that
there
would
be
a
day
of
reckoning.
and
the
only
way
in
which
there
can
be
meaning
to
the
antitrust
laws,
the
only
way
the
integrity
of
your
mandate
may
be
respected
is
by
a
divestiture
at
once
without
delay
and
so
far
as
i
am
concerned
by
cash
sale.
now,
counsel
for
el
paso
presented
a
case
of
corporate
hardship
in
terms
of
the
terrible
burdens
attacked
to
endure
by
virtue
of
acquired
and
unlawful
asset.
let
me
point
this
out,
el
paso
has
had
the
income
from
the
northwest
system
ever
since
state
of
acquisition
and
more
than
that
el
paso
was
had
the
benefit
of
no
competition
because
of
an
acquisition.
and
the
divestiture
plan
of
el
paso
filed
on
august
4,
1967
in
tab
13
thereof,
points
out
from
their
figures
that
the
net
income
from
the
northwest
system
for
the
calendar
year
1968
is
going
to
be
and
was
$8,092,000.00.
that's
$8
million
net
income
by
a
virtue
of
having
violated
the
clayton
act.
in
addition
to
that,
there
is
cash
flow
from
depreciation,
depletion
and
amortization
of
$10,123,000.00
or
in
short
a
cash
flow
of
$18
million
and
that
can
hardly
be
described
as
a
penalty
for
violating
the
clayton
act.
it
is
a
bonus.
now,
there's
a
certain
detriment
to
the
bonus,
i
assume
on
it
they
will
have
to
pay
federal
income
taxes
but
other
than
that
it
is
free
and
clear.
and
so
i
would
say
to
you
that
since
el
paso
has
known
ever
since
california
versus
fpc
in
1962,
what
might
occur
to
it,
and
i'm
sure
that
they
read
du
pont
and
all
those
other
cases,
you
should
make
the
monopoly
laws
effective
by
taking
the
bonus
out
of
violation.
and
not
only
should
all
of
the
properties
go
back,
all
of
them
are
not
exception,
but
as
well
the
income
from
those
properties
commencing
with
california
versus
the
federal
power
commission.
now,
if
that
seems
too
harsh,
you
then
at
the
very
least
should
begin
in
the
year
1964,
i
believe
it
is
when
in
u.s.a.
versus
el
paso
you
pronounced
a
clear
violation
of
section
7
of
the
clayton
act.
certainly
as
of
april
6,
1964,
el
paso
knew
from
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
that
the
continued
operation
of
the
northwest
division
was
in
violation
of
the
clayton
act.
and
we
must
bear
in
mind
that
but
for
the
acquisition
of
northwest
by
el
paso
that
same
income
would
be
going
to
pacific
northwest
pipeline
and
so
far
as
i
am
concern
in
my
judgment
with
that
income
that
pipeline
would
be
in
the
california
gas
market
today.
now,
i
do
not
say
this
lightly
i
ask
you
to
view
this
case
lasting
more
than
a
decade,
i
asked
you
to
view
the
deliberate
calculated
violation
by
el
paso.
these
are
not
crimes
of
passion.
these
are
knowing-calculated
acts
of
corporations
through
officers
indulged
in
pursuant
to
legal
opinion,
meetings,
authorizations
of
directors
and
all
those
myriad
of
detail
steps
which
must
be
gone
through
before
a
corporation
decides
to
violate
the
clayton
act.
and
if
you
fail
to
do
something
of
this
nature,
then
what
you
were
saying
is
that
the
clayton
act
is
there
and
the
divestiture
is
there
but
in
terms
of
taking
the
profit
of
law
violation
we
know
of
no
way
to
do
it
and
the
reference
i
made
in
the
brief
to
the
article
in
that
publication
entitled
“antitrust
law
and
economics
review”
by
a
dr.
kenneth
g.
elzinga
has
a
study
therein
of
the
unlawful
acquisitions
over
the
past
few
years
pointing
out
that
in
each
and
everyone
of
them
there
was
a
purchase
in
one
year
for
a
certain
dollar
figure,
there
was
a
divestiture
three
or
four
years
later
and
a
great
increase
in
property
value,
a
great
increase
in
profit
to
the
corporation
as
well
as
the
unlawful
income
in
the
interim.
now,
if
the
monopoly
laws
are
to
be
meaningful,
this
is
the
remedy
which
must
be
imposed.
it
is
not
harsh
particularly
in
this
case
where
they
have
been
on
notice
as
you
yourself
said
almost
from
the
very
beginning.
now,
your
honors
there's
something
which
must
be
discussed
here
about
this
case
and
your
mandate
and
that
is
the
history
of
it,
the
frustrations
of
it,
the
delays
of
it.
when
i
come
here
sometimes,
it
occurs
to
me
that
you
only
see
the
top
of
the
iceberg
and
that
we're
here
simply
because
we
filed
the
proper
pleadings.
i
come
before
you,
address
you
and
then
leave.
but
this
case
represents
an
abuse
of
the
economic
and
therefore
the
political
power
of
the
world's
first
natural
gas
pipeline
company.
the
very
appeal
i
took
to
you
in
california
versus
fpc
was
made
below
on
the
60th
and
last
day.
why?
because
of
the
great
influence
of
el
paso
in
my
state
persuading
public
officials
there
should
be
no
appeal
and
but
for
the
perseverance
we
would
never
had
california
versus
fpc
and
we
would
never
but
for
that
case
have
had
returned
to
our
state
$155
million
by
way
of
refund.
the
same
with
u.s.a.
versus
el
paso
again,
all
of
the
forces
they
can
bear
to
persuade
public
officials
not
to
pursue
proper
appeals
before
this
or
other
courts.
the
appeal
which
is
symbolized
in
your
decision
known
as
cascade
was
preceded
by
a
deliberate,
public,
calculated
attempt
by
the
attorney
for
el
paso
to
remove
me,
a
public
official
from
the
case
and
as
the
record
before
you
shows,
they
almost
succeeded.
they
did
succeed
in
getting
oregon
to
drop
its
appeal.
by
telling
oregon,
no
more
gas
the
other
side
of
the
columbia.
and
so
it
is
with
the
case
here
today.
these
appeals
of
the
parties
were
not
dropped
so
far
as
i
am
concern
for
any
proper
considerations
but
for
agreements
which
are
highly
suspect
and
they
involved
not
just
california,
not
just
utah,
not
the
west
but
the
integrity
of
government
and
of
this
court
itself.
this
court
if
it
drops
the
utah
appeal
is
being
used
by
the
parties
and
the
instrument
is
that
suspect
agreement.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
in
view
of
all
i've
said
about
the
time,
the
delay,
the
contracts,
the
dubious
arrangements
that
this
is
one
case
in
which
the
court
should
be
quite
severe
in
its
judgment
should
be
quite
prompt
in
ordering
divestiture
and
should
take
the
profit
out
of
monopoly
law
violation
by
removing
from
el
paso
all
of
the
profits
since
the
decision
of
this
court
in
u.s.a.
versus
el
paso.
your
honors,
i
have
another
30
minutes.
i
have
completed
my
argument,
if
you
have
questions
i
would
be
happy
to
answer
them
but
other
than
that
i
feel
i've
completed
what
i
have
to
say
here
today.
there's
one
last
thing
i
would
like
to
say
mr.
chief
justice
then.
i've
been
here
on
many
occasions
for
over
a
decade
and
i
can
only
speak
for
myself
and
i
think
my
family
but
i
think
i
speak
for
a
great,
great
many
other
americans.
we
are
grateful
to
the
supreme
court
of
united
states
under
chief
justice
warren
and
i
think
our
children
will
long
remember
all
we've
done
for
us
and
the
greatest
honor
i've
had
as
a
lawyer
is
to
have
appeared
in
the
time
of
the
warren
court
to
address
you.
thank
you.
