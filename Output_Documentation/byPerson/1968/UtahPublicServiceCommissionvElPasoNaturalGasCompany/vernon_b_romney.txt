mr.
vernon
b.
romney
yes,
sir.
public
service
commission
of
utah
is
present
sir.
mr.
vernon
b.
romney
mr.
chief
justice
and
justices,
if
it
please
the
court.
the
utah
public
service
commission
was
an
intervenor
in
this
case
filed
a
notice
of
appeal
on
september
18,
1969.
at
that
time,
mr.
phil
l.
hansen
was
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
utah.
the
appeal
was
actually
handled
by
daniel
l.
berman,
a
special
assistant
to
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
utah.
upon
taking
office
on
january
6th
of
1969
as
the
attorney
general
of
utah,
i
began
a
careful
investigation
of
the
merits
of
prosecuting
the
appeal
or
of
dismissing
it
and
this
i
did
in
the
association
with
the
governor
of
the
state
of
utah,
calvin
l.
rampton.
we
eventually
determined
that
it
was
in
the
best
interest
of
the
state
of
utah
to
move
to
dismiss
the
appeal
thereupon
took
steps
in
february
to
perfect
the
dismissal
and
as
stated
in
our
short
brief
are
reasons
were
among
others
that
we
felt
no
responsibility
for
the
litigation
of
the
clayton
act
and
felt
this
was
the
responsibility
of
--
if
or
anyone
that
is
to
appeal
of
the
justice
department
and
none
of
us.
we
felt
for
one
thing
that
would
be
a
tremendous
amount
of
expense
to
our
small
state
that
we
did
not
have
on
our
legal
staff
the
experience
and
experts
in
the
field
that
would
be
necessary
for
us
to
employ
them
and
to
reproduce
the
record
and
perform
many
activities
and
employ
many
people
which
would
take
a
considerable
amount
of
our
money
that
was
very
difficult
thing
to
do.
and
we
thought
it
would
take
a
lot
of
time
and
would
prevent
the
termination
of
this
case
which
has
dragged
on,
i
understand
for
a
period
of
about
11
years.
we
determined
that
the
issues
which
were
involved
in
our
jurisdictional
statement
were
those
which
affected
in
the
main
other
states
are
good
deal
more
than
they
did
to
utah
and
it
appeared
that
the
other
states
were
not
interested
in
appealing
and
took
no
effort
to
perfect
their
appeals.
we
felt
no
obligation
to
carry
out
our
appeal
in
the
interest
of
these
other
states
and
other
people
at
our
own
expense
and
a
word
we
were
left
to
go
alone.
we
also
felt
there
was
no
evidence
that
another
company
then
colorado
interstate
gas
company
would
do
a
better
job.
we
felt
the
colorado
interstate
gas
company
had
great
experience,
solid
background,
and
the
financial
stability
to
do
the
work
well
and
we
felt
that
they
were
eventually
we
came
to
feel
after
getting
to
know
them
that
they
would
be
good
neighbor
with
us
and
utah
would
be
very
helpful
to
us
and
after
we
came
to
the
point
of
determining
that
our
principal
real
interest
which
were
of
an
economic
nature
in
this
case
would
be
provided
for
that
is
they
will
keep
their
headquarters
in
salt
lake
city
that
they
would
keep
the
employees
who
work
there,
all
of
them
on
the
job
at
the
same
or
at
increased
rates
of
compensation
that
indeed
they
would
employ
other
people
in
those
presently
on
a
payroll
in
the
el
paso
headquarters.
when
all
of
these
things
were
determined
we
felt
that
we
would
benefit
materially
from
having
colorado
interstate
gas
company
upheld
as
the
company
to
take
over
the
northwest
pipeline
system.
some
allegations
have
been
made
that
this
was
unusual
thing
that
the
governor
of
the
state
of
utah
signed
the
motion
before
the
court
to
dismiss
the
appeal
but
this
was
done
only
in
the
interest
of
time
and
the
fact
that
the
governor
at
that
time
was
a
member
of
the
bar
of
the
supreme
court
of
united
states
and
that
mr.
berman
determined
that
he
should
do
it
in
this
manner.
no
time
has
been
any
difference
of
opinion
since
i
first
learned
of
the
governor's
attitude
toward
this
case.
he
felt
that
it
should
be
dismissed.
i
did
and
the
public
service
commission
of
the
state
of
utah
joined
me
in
this
belief.
