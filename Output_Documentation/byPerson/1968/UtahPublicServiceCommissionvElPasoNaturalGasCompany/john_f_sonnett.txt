mr.
john
f.
sonnett
mr.
chief
justice,
if
it
please
the
court.
i
think
i
would
be
remiss
in
not
noting
in
behalf
of
the
bar,
i
regret
this
--
we
are
told
this
is
the
last
session
of
this
court
over
which
you
must
the
chief
justice
will
preside,
we
shall
miss
you.
in
terms
of
california
interstate
gas,
i
have
in
my
main
argument
several
points
only
to
make.
first
is
we
are
not,
we
have
not
be
in
a
potential
competitor.
in
1965,
when
the
cascade
case
was
before
you
in
the
record
in
that
proceeding,
your
honors
had
proposed
findings
which
had
been
submitted
by
the
government
to
the
trial
court
to
judge
ritter.
i
would
like
to
summarize
briefly
two
findings
which
the
government
had
proposed
at
that
time
over
14
years
ago
but
which
judge
ritter
never
passed
upon.
the
first
was
proposed
government
finding
60
which
said
for
the
several
months
colorado
interstate
has
attempted
to
discuss
with
el
paso
a
purchase
of
the
properties
to
be
divested
but
has
been
rebuffed
in
its
attempts.
the
second
proposed
finding,
our
proposed
finding
61
was
colorado
interstate
would
be
interested
in
using
the
facilities
to
be
divested
as
the
basis
for
a
project
to
enter
and
serve
the
california
market.
it
is
improbable
that
colorado
interstate
would
by
itself
and
without
those
facilities
be
in
a
position
to
enter
the
california
market.
now
your
honors
what
is
true
in
1965,
the
government
stated
in
its
proposed
findings
was
true
in
the
long
hearing
subsequent
to
your
remand
and
in
the
proceedings
before
judge
chilson.
despite
the
fact
that
there
were
some
six
months
of
hearings
that
there
were
26
parties,
the
two
senior
executives
of
colorado
interstate
testified
and
were
cross-examined
that
late
by
everyone
including
the
government.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
before
this
court
to
cast
the
slightest
doubt
on
the
validity
of
the
proposed
finding
which
the
government
itself
tended
to
judge
ritter
in
1965.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
colorado
was
not
and
is
not
interested,
nor
capable
of
competing
in
the
california
market
without
the
facilities
which
it
proposes
here
to
acquire.
i
don't
think
that
your
honors
will
find
a
word
of
evidence
in
the
record
suggesting
the
contrary.
those
are
certainly
the
findings
of
judge
chilson.
they
are
meticulous
findings
as
you
suggested
should
be
made.
he
has
made
it
and
there
is
nothing
that
i
am
aware
of
in
the
record
to
cast
the
slightest
factual
doubt
about
amounting
competition
to
california
as
your
honor's
opinions
have
pointed
out
in
this
industry
is
the
very
expensive
and
difficult
project
because
obviously
what
we
are
competing
for
is
the
incremental
demand.
pursuant
to
the
decision
below,
we
are
already
at
work
competing.
we
are
already
at
work
competing
to
the
extent
that
we
can
for
the
california
market.
we
have
pursuant
to
the
contract
with
california
a
copy
of
which
we
submitted
to
your
honors.
we
have
engaged
in
negotiations
with
purchases
in
california.
we
are
making
market
studies,
we
are
conducting
feasibility
studies,
we
are
making
engineering
studies,
we
are
trying
to
get
ourselves
into
a
position
that
we
will
have
assurance
of
sufficient
business
in
california
that
would
warn
us
in
acquiring
the
very
great
reserves
of
gas
that
will
be
required
and
i'm
spending
some
$250
million
to
build
a
pipeline
to
get
that
gas
to
california.
your
honors
have
in
mind
that
of
course
that
the
california
market
is
a
very
different
thing
today,
the
market
was
10
years
ago.
today,
california
interstate
in
attempting
to
go
into
competition
in
california
faces
entrenched
strong
competition
from
three
companies,
the
smallest
of
which
is
twice
our
size
but
we
are
doing
our
best
to
go
ahead.
if
this
court
sees
fit
to
grant
the
motion
of
utah
to
dismiss
its
appeal,
we
shall
progress
this
summer
with
our
work
and
hopefully
be
in
a
position
to
reach
some
final
conclusion
that
we
are
able
to
go
ahead
because
we
have
the
business,
we're
working
on
the
acquisition
of
reserves
and
we
are
fortunately
in
a
position
to
contemplate
a
substantial
financing
program.
so
your
honors,
we
are
hard
at
work
so
far
as
the
suggestion
that
we
might
have
competed
in
the
present
markets
of
northwest,
there
is
nothing
whatsoever
in
the
record
to
support
that
suggestion.
i
say
to
your
honors
we
were
not,
we
are
not
potential
competitors
with
northwest.
we
have
never
in
fact
been
competitors
and
the
only
way
this
court
is
going
to
get
the
competition
which
should
be
additional
competition
which
it
desired
in
california
was
as
judge
chilson
found
here
below
after
a
full
hearing
that
we
can
bring
our
strength
to
bear
with
the
facilities
of
northwest
and
take
the
risk
of
hundreds
or
millions
of
dollars
of
expense
to
go
into
that
market.
that
we
proposed
to
do
and
we
shall
if
the
court
will
allow
us.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
mr.
chief
justice,
we
had
saved
some
time
for
rebuttal.
i
think
the
marshal
has
advised
that
we
have
something
like
17
minutes
but
actually
i
only
need
several
minutes.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
if
that
meets
with
your
honor's
approval?
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
well,
i
think
mr.
justice
douglas
that
it
will
be
like
the
wonderful
operation
but
the
patient
died.
if
it
is
the
fact
--
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
because
the
only
way
that
we
can
compete
is
the
way
we
are
competing.
as
you
pointed
out
competition
is
for
the
incremental
demand.
now,
as
a
practical
matter
--
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
first,
we
have
to
go
and
see
if
we
can
get
some
customers
and
we
are
doing
that.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
we
have
to
do
that
as
well.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
well,
may
i
give
you
a
little
fuller
answer
mr.
justice
douglas
to
what,
what
we
have
in
doing.
let
me
say
in
more
detail
why
i
think
that
since
the
decision
below,
we
are
competing
for
california
in
the
only
effective
way
that
competition
can
occur
in
this
industry.
what
have
we
done?
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
yes,
which
is
all
anyone
can
do
mr.
justice
douglas.
that's
all
anyone
can
do
and
that
we
have
been
doing.
we
have
turned
all
of
our
resources
to
work
to
make
a
market
study
in
california.
and
it's
been
done
in
depths,
it's
been
done
intensively
to
see
whether
there
is
room
in
that
market
to
buy
gas
from
us
three
or
four
years
from
now
if
we're
in
a
position
to
deliver
it.
as
you
know,
as
you
have
pointed
out
in
this
kind
of
business,
it
isn't
like
selling
groceries
on
the
corner
grocery
store.
it's
for
the
incremental
demand
only
that
we
can
compete.
now,
we
have
dedicated,
trained
knowledgeable
people
which
is
one
of
the
fortunate
things
about
--
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
oh!
i
realize
that.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
mr.
justice
douglas.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
it
is
possible.
it
may
be
that
the
competition
in
california
today
which
is
much
more
difficult
than
it
was
10
years
ago
is
so
entrenched
that
we
can't
get
in
there,
maybe.
but
i
say
that
if
a
new
company
is
going
to
get
in
there
at
all
and
compete,
it
will
be
under
our
control
and
with
our
help
because
there's
no
other
way
it
can
do
it.
that's
my
point.
we
stand
ready
assuming
we
can
develop
that
market
so
that
we
know
we
got
customers
for
gas
we
can
deliver
in
three
or
four
years
to
go
out
and
get
the
reserves
and
we
are
negotiating
very
actively
for
reserves
right
now
in
competition
with
others
which
if
we
get
them
we'll
be
ample
to
supply
this
market.
but
with
everyday
of
delay,
our
problem
of
getting
access
to
sufficient
reserves
to
move
in
to
the
california
market
becomes
more
difficult.
the
competitive
handicap
is
greater.
now,
if
we
have
reasonable
assurance
that
we
have
the
business,
we
have
the
customers
and
these
people
are
interested
in
talking
about
meeting
their
needs
in
the
future,
not
all
of
them
obviously,
not
all
of
them,
but
enough
to
make
the
project
feasible.
and
we
can
get
the
reserves
on
which
we
are
currently
working
very
hard
then
we
are
planning
a
pipeline
which
will
cost
about
$250
million
to
move
this
gas
to
california.
but
there's
nothing
we
can
do
over
and
beyond
what
we
are
doing.
there's
nothing
anybody
else
can
do.
there
is
no
way
to
go
in
and
sign
up
a
contract
today
to
deliver
gas
in
three
years
and
guarantee
that
you
can
do
that
until
you
know
you've
got
the
market
you
can
get
the
gas
and
you
can
finance
the
pipeline.
and
this
is
a
complicated
difficult
business
in
which
to
move,
it's
very
difficult
to
compete
particularly
when
you're
competing
for
the
incremental
demand.
and
as
your
honor
knows,
what
do
you
do
with
the
reserves
in
the
meantime?
you've
got
pay
or
take
--
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
well,
unless
we
have
the
assurance
of
the
plan.
why
should
we
go
out
and
spend
very
substantial
amounts
of
money
to
try
to
make
it
work?
i
believe
it
was
(inaudible)
that
spent
$9
million
trying
to
get
into
california
and
dropped
it,
they
couldn't
get
in.
now,
we
are
a
successful
company
but
we're
not
one
of
the
giants
for
us
to
dedicate
manpower,
financial
reserves,
engineering
talent
and
we've
been
up
this
for
sometime.
we've
got
to
have
some
optimist
that
if
we're
capable,
we
will
get
the
reward
that
comes.
colorado
is
a
hardheaded
company.
they've
been
interested
acquiring
these
facilities
because
they
have
been
convinced
it's
the
only
way
they
can
compete
in
the
california
market.
they've
known
for
years
and
the
record
is
abundantly
clear
they
couldn't
do
it
without
these
facilities
and
they
will
not
do
it.
it's
either
do
it
this
way
or
they
can't
do
it
at
all.
now,
obviously
the
new
company
northwest
divested
to
some
new
owner
who
by
the
way
“cash”
let's
say
20%
of
the
stock
and
then
trying
to
sell
that
to
raise
the
money
to
do
it.
there
isn't
any
of
the
contender
for
these
properties
whose
got
where
was
all
the
money,
the
resources
and
management,
the
skilled
people
and
the
experienced
to
do
this
that's
why
judge
chilson
chose
our
company.
that's
why
he
thought
we
would
be
the
most
effective
enter
it
but
the
commitment
mr.
justice
douglas
to
enter
into
this
market
runs
into
the
hundreds
of
millions.
so,
that's
why
we
were
to
happy
to
give
california
that
agreement
in
which
we
outline
the
particular
program
we
would
follow
to
try
to
get
as
soon
as
possible
to
the
conclusion
that
we
could
do
the
job.
that's
the
reason;
we
couldn't
do
it
any
other
way.
it
is
impossible
for
anybody
to
do
it
in
the
other
way.
we
can't
go
out
and
acquire
the
reserves
before
we
have
the
market
because
the
reserves
can
become
surplus
and
you
pay
and
leave
it
in
the
ground
or
take
that
is
an
enormous
financial
burden
and
the
reserves
required
for
this
a
tremendous
so
we
have
to
go
forward
and
steps.
we
have
to
be
--
have
an
assurance
of
the
market
if
we
can
deliver
then
we
have
to
get
the
gas
to
be
sure
that
we
can
meet
that
market
and
then
we
have
to
build
$250
million
pipeline
to
get
the
gas
to
the
customers.
that's
the
kind
of
competition
i
think
mr.
justice
douglas
you
were
talking
about.
it's
all
ready
have
an
impact
in
the
california
market
because
in
the
feelings
of
the
california
customers
with
the
present
suppliers
they
are
aware
of
our
program
and
the
california
customers
today
are
benefiting
from
our
threat
to
enter
the
california
market
in
their
present
negotiations.
it's
competition
at
work
in
this
complicated
industry.
so,
i
say
to
your
honor
that
if
there
is
anyway
to
set
up
a
viable
competitor,
a
new
competitor
for
california
it's
got
to
be
this
way.
otherwise,
this
court
and
the
lower
courts
would've
labored
in
vain.
there
will
be
a
successful
operation
but
the
patient
will
have
done
it.
it
comes
down
to
that.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
from
canada,
mr.
justice
black,
to
california.
assuming
the
program
is
feasible.
it's
a
bold
project
and
we
are
actively
negotiating
now
to
try
and
get
adequate
reserves
in
canada.
i
don't
want
to
mention
where
because
we
are
in
competition
and
there's
two
other
large
companies
right
now
engaged
in
the
negotiating
for
the
reserves.
for
the
extent
they
get
them
for
other
projects
obviously
we
will
not
have
access
to
them
for
us.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
so
that
--
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
well,
that
certainly
is
not
part
of
our
planned
entry.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
justice
black,
that
would
be
other
competitors.
you
see,
since
the
10
years
when
first
gone
into
when
you
had
one
company,
you've
now
got
three
and
those
three
companies
if
i
can
just
take
one
minute
more.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
the
three
companies
who
now
confront
us
in
the
california
market
will
be
el
paso.
now,
el
paso
even
after
this
divestiture
will
have
five
times
our
revenues
and
it's
twice
our
size.
the
second
company
confronting
us
in
california
is
texas
easton
and
transwestern.
they
have
over
five
times
their
earnings
and
they
are
twice
our
size
and
they
in
the
market.
the
third
is
specific
gas
and
electric
and
pacific
gas
transmission
they
have
over
four
times
our
revenues
and
they
are
in
the
market
now.
so,
i
say
mr.
justice
black
that
the
market
in
california
now
for
out-of-state
gas
suppliers
being
supplied
by
three
strong
entrenched
companies
makes
the
competition
for
the
incremental
demand
so
much
more
difficult
and
so
much
more
expensive
to
build
a
pipeline
that
they
cost
so
much
more
than
it
cost
10
years
ago.
i
don't
know
how
any
new
company
can
enter
that
market
unless
it's
a
combination
of
facilities
which
northwest
has
and
money
know-how
and
desire
and
determination
which
colorado
interstate.
it's
the
only
way
to
do
it.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
well,
i
can't
give
you
a
complete
answer
mr.
justice
black.
there
have
been
authorized
enlargements
of
the
facilities
now
in
california
which
have
been
approved
by
the
federal
power
commission.
we
of
course
have
our
applications
pending
for
certificates
to
take
over
the
operation
of
northwest
and
all
that
--
all
the
fpc
is
waiting
for
there
as
for
this
court's
disposition
of
this
problem
and
then
i
believe
we
shall
have
very
promptly
the
certificates
and
be
lawfully
entitled
to
operate
the
northwest
properties.
now,
we
have
not
filed
any
application
yet.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
not
to
california.
we're
not
in
a
position
to
file
an
application
yet
for
a
new
pipeline
because
of
the
two
threshold
questions.
can
we
get
enough
market?
can
we
get
enough
for
the
incremental
demand
to
make
the
project
feasible
and
if
so
can
we
get
off
gas
to
supply
it
and
where
is
the
gas
coming?
we're
far
enough
down
the
road
so
that
the
california
interstate
executives
believe
it
is
still
feasible
to
become
a
worthwhile
competitor
in
the
california
market
but
only
by
doing
at
this
way.
otherwise,
the
program
is
impossible.
they
could
not
and
would
not
attempt
to
do
it
by
themselves
without
the
facilities
which
they
proposed
to
acquire
here
with
this
court's
permission.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
well,
there
is
a
segment
mr.
justice
douglas
if
we
get
access
to
the
reserves
we're
now
negotiating
for.
there
will
be
a
segment
of
pipeline
that
will
have
to
be
built
in
canada
as
well
as
in
the
united
states.
if
my
recollection
is
correct
i
think
the
total
line
of
the
pipeline
involved,
the
total
mileage
of
the
pipeline
that
would
be
involved,
there
is
something
like
2000
miles.
it's
a
terrible
pipeline
and
it
will
cost
$250
million.
to
get
that
kind
of
financing
obviously
we
have
got
to
have
some
market,
we
got
to
have
some
contracts,
and
we
got
to
have
some
reserves
at
end.
now,
may
i
just
make
one
other
observation?
all
of
the
mystery
that's
been
created
about
the
utah
contract
by
counsel
and
the
california
contract,
i
think
i
can
dismiss
briefly
as
i
think
the
court
should.
when
our
executives
testified
in
the
district
court
before
judge
chilson,
they
described
what
colorado's
policy
was
generally
and
what
they
would
do
generally.
they
mentioned
that
it
was
company
policy
as
it
was
in
this
to
try
and
put
local
men
on
boards
of
directors.
to
encourage
local
participation
wherever
the
pipeline
runs
and
that
they
were
going
to
do
and
that
they
had
done.
the
utah
contract
which
the
attorney
general
of
utah
and
the
governor
regards
as
in
the
local
economic
interest
of
utah
most
certainly
is
but
it
hasn't
the
one
with
thrust
significance
nor
was
it
kept
to
secret,
it
was
announced
by
the
governor
publicly.
the
other
thing
is
this
reference
to
the
so-called
secret
california
agreement
by
counsel
is
absurd
in
the
papers
before
this
court.
counsel
makes
bunch
of
the
fact
that
he
couldn't
find
the
copy
of
this
so-called
secret
agreement.
well,
all
he
had
to
do
is
call
us
up;
it's
been
on
file
at
the
federal
power
commission
for
months.
it's
been
a
public
record
that's
why
we
appended
both
of
them
to
our
papers,
the
utah
agreement,
the
california
agreement
so
that
your
honors
could
see
there
is
nothing
vicious,
corrupt,
or
wrongful
about
either
one.
they're
perfectly
normal
sensible
agreements.
and
i'm
sure
that
we
take
as
much
pride
in
both
of
them
as
california
does
and
utah
do
and
their
officials
are
very
proud
of
them
and
so
are
we.
i
have
nothing
further
mr.
chief
justice.
thank
you.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
mr.
chief
justice,
if
it
please
the
court.
i
think
i
would
be
remiss
in
not
noting
in
behalf
of
the
bar,
i
regret
this
--
we
are
told
this
is
the
last
session
of
this
court
over
which
you
must
the
chief
justice
will
preside,
we
shall
miss
you.
in
terms
of
california
interstate
gas,
i
have
in
my
main
argument
several
points
only
to
make.
first
is
we
are
not,
we
have
not
be
in
a
potential
competitor.
in
1965,
when
the
cascade
case
was
before
you
in
the
record
in
that
proceeding,
your
honors
had
proposed
findings
which
had
been
submitted
by
the
government
to
the
trial
court
to
judge
ritter.
i
would
like
to
summarize
briefly
two
findings
which
the
government
had
proposed
at
that
time
over
14
years
ago
but
which
judge
ritter
never
passed
upon.
the
first
was
proposed
government
finding
60
which
said
for
the
several
months
colorado
interstate
has
attempted
to
discuss
with
el
paso
a
purchase
of
the
properties
to
be
divested
but
has
been
rebuffed
in
its
attempts.
the
second
proposed
finding,
our
proposed
finding
61
was
colorado
interstate
would
be
interested
in
using
the
facilities
to
be
divested
as
the
basis
for
a
project
to
enter
and
serve
the
california
market.
it
is
improbable
that
colorado
interstate
would
by
itself
and
without
those
facilities
be
in
a
position
to
enter
the
california
market.
now
your
honors
what
is
true
in
1965,
the
government
stated
in
its
proposed
findings
was
true
in
the
long
hearing
subsequent
to
your
remand
and
in
the
proceedings
before
judge
chilson.
despite
the
fact
that
there
were
some
six
months
of
hearings
that
there
were
26
parties,
the
two
senior
executives
of
colorado
interstate
testified
and
were
cross-examined
that
late
by
everyone
including
the
government.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
before
this
court
to
cast
the
slightest
doubt
on
the
validity
of
the
proposed
finding
which
the
government
itself
tended
to
judge
ritter
in
1965.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
colorado
was
not
and
is
not
interested,
nor
capable
of
competing
in
the
california
market
without
the
facilities
which
it
proposes
here
to
acquire.
i
don't
think
that
your
honors
will
find
a
word
of
evidence
in
the
record
suggesting
the
contrary.
those
are
certainly
the
findings
of
judge
chilson.
they
are
meticulous
findings
as
you
suggested
should
be
made.
he
has
made
it
and
there
is
nothing
that
i
am
aware
of
in
the
record
to
cast
the
slightest
factual
doubt
about
amounting
competition
to
california
as
your
honor's
opinions
have
pointed
out
in
this
industry
is
the
very
expensive
and
difficult
project
because
obviously
what
we
are
competing
for
is
the
incremental
demand.
pursuant
to
the
decision
below,
we
are
already
at
work
competing.
we
are
already
at
work
competing
to
the
extent
that
we
can
for
the
california
market.
we
have
pursuant
to
the
contract
with
california
a
copy
of
which
we
submitted
to
your
honors.
we
have
engaged
in
negotiations
with
purchases
in
california.
we
are
making
market
studies,
we
are
conducting
feasibility
studies,
we
are
making
engineering
studies,
we
are
trying
to
get
ourselves
into
a
position
that
we
will
have
assurance
of
sufficient
business
in
california
that
would
warn
us
in
acquiring
the
very
great
reserves
of
gas
that
will
be
required
and
i'm
spending
some
$250
million
to
build
a
pipeline
to
get
that
gas
to
california.
your
honors
have
in
mind
that
of
course
that
the
california
market
is
a
very
different
thing
today,
the
market
was
10
years
ago.
today,
california
interstate
in
attempting
to
go
into
competition
in
california
faces
entrenched
strong
competition
from
three
companies,
the
smallest
of
which
is
twice
our
size
but
we
are
doing
our
best
to
go
ahead.
if
this
court
sees
fit
to
grant
the
motion
of
utah
to
dismiss
its
appeal,
we
shall
progress
this
summer
with
our
work
and
hopefully
be
in
a
position
to
reach
some
final
conclusion
that
we
are
able
to
go
ahead
because
we
have
the
business,
we're
working
on
the
acquisition
of
reserves
and
we
are
fortunately
in
a
position
to
contemplate
a
substantial
financing
program.
so
your
honors,
we
are
hard
at
work
so
far
as
the
suggestion
that
we
might
have
competed
in
the
present
markets
of
northwest,
there
is
nothing
whatsoever
in
the
record
to
support
that
suggestion.
i
say
to
your
honors
we
were
not,
we
are
not
potential
competitors
with
northwest.
we
have
never
in
fact
been
competitors
and
the
only
way
this
court
is
going
to
get
the
competition
which
should
be
additional
competition
which
it
desired
in
california
was
as
judge
chilson
found
here
below
after
a
full
hearing
that
we
can
bring
our
strength
to
bear
with
the
facilities
of
northwest
and
take
the
risk
of
hundreds
or
millions
of
dollars
of
expense
to
go
into
that
market.
that
we
proposed
to
do
and
we
shall
if
the
court
will
allow
us.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
mr.
chief
justice,
we
had
saved
some
time
for
rebuttal.
i
think
the
marshal
has
advised
that
we
have
something
like
17
minutes
but
actually
i
only
need
several
minutes.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
if
that
meets
with
your
honor's
approval?
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
well,
i
think
mr.
justice
douglas
that
it
will
be
like
the
wonderful
operation
but
the
patient
died.
if
it
is
the
fact
--
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
because
the
only
way
that
we
can
compete
is
the
way
we
are
competing.
as
you
pointed
out
competition
is
for
the
incremental
demand.
now,
as
a
practical
matter
--
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
first,
we
have
to
go
and
see
if
we
can
get
some
customers
and
we
are
doing
that.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
we
have
to
do
that
as
well.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
well,
may
i
give
you
a
little
fuller
answer
mr.
justice
douglas
to
what,
what
we
have
in
doing.
let
me
say
in
more
detail
why
i
think
that
since
the
decision
below,
we
are
competing
for
california
in
the
only
effective
way
that
competition
can
occur
in
this
industry.
what
have
we
done?
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
yes,
which
is
all
anyone
can
do
mr.
justice
douglas.
that's
all
anyone
can
do
and
that
we
have
been
doing.
we
have
turned
all
of
our
resources
to
work
to
make
a
market
study
in
california.
and
it's
been
done
in
depths,
it's
been
done
intensively
to
see
whether
there
is
room
in
that
market
to
buy
gas
from
us
three
or
four
years
from
now
if
we're
in
a
position
to
deliver
it.
as
you
know,
as
you
have
pointed
out
in
this
kind
of
business,
it
isn't
like
selling
groceries
on
the
corner
grocery
store.
it's
for
the
incremental
demand
only
that
we
can
compete.
now,
we
have
dedicated,
trained
knowledgeable
people
which
is
one
of
the
fortunate
things
about
--
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
oh!
i
realize
that.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
mr.
justice
douglas.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
it
is
possible.
it
may
be
that
the
competition
in
california
today
which
is
much
more
difficult
than
it
was
10
years
ago
is
so
entrenched
that
we
can't
get
in
there,
maybe.
but
i
say
that
if
a
new
company
is
going
to
get
in
there
at
all
and
compete,
it
will
be
under
our
control
and
with
our
help
because
there's
no
other
way
it
can
do
it.
that's
my
point.
we
stand
ready
assuming
we
can
develop
that
market
so
that
we
know
we
got
customers
for
gas
we
can
deliver
in
three
or
four
years
to
go
out
and
get
the
reserves
and
we
are
negotiating
very
actively
for
reserves
right
now
in
competition
with
others
which
if
we
get
them
we'll
be
ample
to
supply
this
market.
but
with
everyday
of
delay,
our
problem
of
getting
access
to
sufficient
reserves
to
move
in
to
the
california
market
becomes
more
difficult.
the
competitive
handicap
is
greater.
now,
if
we
have
reasonable
assurance
that
we
have
the
business,
we
have
the
customers
and
these
people
are
interested
in
talking
about
meeting
their
needs
in
the
future,
not
all
of
them
obviously,
not
all
of
them,
but
enough
to
make
the
project
feasible.
and
we
can
get
the
reserves
on
which
we
are
currently
working
very
hard
then
we
are
planning
a
pipeline
which
will
cost
about
$250
million
to
move
this
gas
to
california.
but
there's
nothing
we
can
do
over
and
beyond
what
we
are
doing.
there's
nothing
anybody
else
can
do.
there
is
no
way
to
go
in
and
sign
up
a
contract
today
to
deliver
gas
in
three
years
and
guarantee
that
you
can
do
that
until
you
know
you've
got
the
market
you
can
get
the
gas
and
you
can
finance
the
pipeline.
and
this
is
a
complicated
difficult
business
in
which
to
move,
it's
very
difficult
to
compete
particularly
when
you're
competing
for
the
incremental
demand.
and
as
your
honor
knows,
what
do
you
do
with
the
reserves
in
the
meantime?
you've
got
pay
or
take
--
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
well,
unless
we
have
the
assurance
of
the
plan.
why
should
we
go
out
and
spend
very
substantial
amounts
of
money
to
try
to
make
it
work?
i
believe
it
was
(inaudible)
that
spent
$9
million
trying
to
get
into
california
and
dropped
it,
they
couldn't
get
in.
now,
we
are
a
successful
company
but
we're
not
one
of
the
giants
for
us
to
dedicate
manpower,
financial
reserves,
engineering
talent
and
we've
been
up
this
for
sometime.
we've
got
to
have
some
optimist
that
if
we're
capable,
we
will
get
the
reward
that
comes.
colorado
is
a
hardheaded
company.
they've
been
interested
acquiring
these
facilities
because
they
have
been
convinced
it's
the
only
way
they
can
compete
in
the
california
market.
they've
known
for
years
and
the
record
is
abundantly
clear
they
couldn't
do
it
without
these
facilities
and
they
will
not
do
it.
it's
either
do
it
this
way
or
they
can't
do
it
at
all.
now,
obviously
the
new
company
northwest
divested
to
some
new
owner
who
by
the
way
“cash”
let's
say
20%
of
the
stock
and
then
trying
to
sell
that
to
raise
the
money
to
do
it.
there
isn't
any
of
the
contender
for
these
properties
whose
got
where
was
all
the
money,
the
resources
and
management,
the
skilled
people
and
the
experienced
to
do
this
that's
why
judge
chilson
chose
our
company.
that's
why
he
thought
we
would
be
the
most
effective
enter
it
but
the
commitment
mr.
justice
douglas
to
enter
into
this
market
runs
into
the
hundreds
of
millions.
so,
that's
why
we
were
to
happy
to
give
california
that
agreement
in
which
we
outline
the
particular
program
we
would
follow
to
try
to
get
as
soon
as
possible
to
the
conclusion
that
we
could
do
the
job.
that's
the
reason;
we
couldn't
do
it
any
other
way.
it
is
impossible
for
anybody
to
do
it
in
the
other
way.
we
can't
go
out
and
acquire
the
reserves
before
we
have
the
market
because
the
reserves
can
become
surplus
and
you
pay
and
leave
it
in
the
ground
or
take
that
is
an
enormous
financial
burden
and
the
reserves
required
for
this
a
tremendous
so
we
have
to
go
forward
and
steps.
we
have
to
be
--
have
an
assurance
of
the
market
if
we
can
deliver
then
we
have
to
get
the
gas
to
be
sure
that
we
can
meet
that
market
and
then
we
have
to
build
$250
million
pipeline
to
get
the
gas
to
the
customers.
that's
the
kind
of
competition
i
think
mr.
justice
douglas
you
were
talking
about.
it's
all
ready
have
an
impact
in
the
california
market
because
in
the
feelings
of
the
california
customers
with
the
present
suppliers
they
are
aware
of
our
program
and
the
california
customers
today
are
benefiting
from
our
threat
to
enter
the
california
market
in
their
present
negotiations.
it's
competition
at
work
in
this
complicated
industry.
so,
i
say
to
your
honor
that
if
there
is
anyway
to
set
up
a
viable
competitor,
a
new
competitor
for
california
it's
got
to
be
this
way.
otherwise,
this
court
and
the
lower
courts
would've
labored
in
vain.
there
will
be
a
successful
operation
but
the
patient
will
have
done
it.
it
comes
down
to
that.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
from
canada,
mr.
justice
black,
to
california.
assuming
the
program
is
feasible.
it's
a
bold
project
and
we
are
actively
negotiating
now
to
try
and
get
adequate
reserves
in
canada.
i
don't
want
to
mention
where
because
we
are
in
competition
and
there's
two
other
large
companies
right
now
engaged
in
the
negotiating
for
the
reserves.
for
the
extent
they
get
them
for
other
projects
obviously
we
will
not
have
access
to
them
for
us.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
so
that
--
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
well,
that
certainly
is
not
part
of
our
planned
entry.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
justice
black,
that
would
be
other
competitors.
you
see,
since
the
10
years
when
first
gone
into
when
you
had
one
company,
you've
now
got
three
and
those
three
companies
if
i
can
just
take
one
minute
more.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
the
three
companies
who
now
confront
us
in
the
california
market
will
be
el
paso.
now,
el
paso
even
after
this
divestiture
will
have
five
times
our
revenues
and
it's
twice
our
size.
the
second
company
confronting
us
in
california
is
texas
easton
and
transwestern.
they
have
over
five
times
their
earnings
and
they
are
twice
our
size
and
they
in
the
market.
the
third
is
specific
gas
and
electric
and
pacific
gas
transmission
they
have
over
four
times
our
revenues
and
they
are
in
the
market
now.
so,
i
say
mr.
justice
black
that
the
market
in
california
now
for
out-of-state
gas
suppliers
being
supplied
by
three
strong
entrenched
companies
makes
the
competition
for
the
incremental
demand
so
much
more
difficult
and
so
much
more
expensive
to
build
a
pipeline
that
they
cost
so
much
more
than
it
cost
10
years
ago.
i
don't
know
how
any
new
company
can
enter
that
market
unless
it's
a
combination
of
facilities
which
northwest
has
and
money
know-how
and
desire
and
determination
which
colorado
interstate.
it's
the
only
way
to
do
it.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
well,
i
can't
give
you
a
complete
answer
mr.
justice
black.
there
have
been
authorized
enlargements
of
the
facilities
now
in
california
which
have
been
approved
by
the
federal
power
commission.
we
of
course
have
our
applications
pending
for
certificates
to
take
over
the
operation
of
northwest
and
all
that
--
all
the
fpc
is
waiting
for
there
as
for
this
court's
disposition
of
this
problem
and
then
i
believe
we
shall
have
very
promptly
the
certificates
and
be
lawfully
entitled
to
operate
the
northwest
properties.
now,
we
have
not
filed
any
application
yet.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
not
to
california.
we're
not
in
a
position
to
file
an
application
yet
for
a
new
pipeline
because
of
the
two
threshold
questions.
can
we
get
enough
market?
can
we
get
enough
for
the
incremental
demand
to
make
the
project
feasible
and
if
so
can
we
get
off
gas
to
supply
it
and
where
is
the
gas
coming?
we're
far
enough
down
the
road
so
that
the
california
interstate
executives
believe
it
is
still
feasible
to
become
a
worthwhile
competitor
in
the
california
market
but
only
by
doing
at
this
way.
otherwise,
the
program
is
impossible.
they
could
not
and
would
not
attempt
to
do
it
by
themselves
without
the
facilities
which
they
proposed
to
acquire
here
with
this
court's
permission.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
well,
there
is
a
segment
mr.
justice
douglas
if
we
get
access
to
the
reserves
we're
now
negotiating
for.
there
will
be
a
segment
of
pipeline
that
will
have
to
be
built
in
canada
as
well
as
in
the
united
states.
if
my
recollection
is
correct
i
think
the
total
line
of
the
pipeline
involved,
the
total
mileage
of
the
pipeline
that
would
be
involved,
there
is
something
like
2000
miles.
it's
a
terrible
pipeline
and
it
will
cost
$250
million.
to
get
that
kind
of
financing
obviously
we
have
got
to
have
some
market,
we
got
to
have
some
contracts,
and
we
got
to
have
some
reserves
at
end.
now,
may
i
just
make
one
other
observation?
all
of
the
mystery
that's
been
created
about
the
utah
contract
by
counsel
and
the
california
contract,
i
think
i
can
dismiss
briefly
as
i
think
the
court
should.
when
our
executives
testified
in
the
district
court
before
judge
chilson,
they
described
what
colorado's
policy
was
generally
and
what
they
would
do
generally.
they
mentioned
that
it
was
company
policy
as
it
was
in
this
to
try
and
put
local
men
on
boards
of
directors.
to
encourage
local
participation
wherever
the
pipeline
runs
and
that
they
were
going
to
do
and
that
they
had
done.
the
utah
contract
which
the
attorney
general
of
utah
and
the
governor
regards
as
in
the
local
economic
interest
of
utah
most
certainly
is
but
it
hasn't
the
one
with
thrust
significance
nor
was
it
kept
to
secret,
it
was
announced
by
the
governor
publicly.
the
other
thing
is
this
reference
to
the
so-called
secret
california
agreement
by
counsel
is
absurd
in
the
papers
before
this
court.
counsel
makes
bunch
of
the
fact
that
he
couldn't
find
the
copy
of
this
so-called
secret
agreement.
well,
all
he
had
to
do
is
call
us
up;
it's
been
on
file
at
the
federal
power
commission
for
months.
it's
been
a
public
record
that's
why
we
appended
both
of
them
to
our
papers,
the
utah
agreement,
the
california
agreement
so
that
your
honors
could
see
there
is
nothing
vicious,
corrupt,
or
wrongful
about
either
one.
they're
perfectly
normal
sensible
agreements.
and
i'm
sure
that
we
take
as
much
pride
in
both
of
them
as
california
does
and
utah
do
and
their
officials
are
very
proud
of
them
and
so
are
we.
i
have
nothing
further
mr.
chief
justice.
thank
you.
