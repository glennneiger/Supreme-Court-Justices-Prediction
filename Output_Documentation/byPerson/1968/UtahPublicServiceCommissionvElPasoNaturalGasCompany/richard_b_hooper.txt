mr.
richard
b.
hooper
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court.
i
appear
here
on
behalf
of
the
eight
intervenors
named
in
the
joint
motion
to
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
or
dismissed
the
appeal
of
the
state
of
utah
and
the
brief
in
support
of
this
motion.
this
motion
was
served
upon
all
parties
of
record
in
the
lower
court
proceedings
last
february
and
filed
on
april
21
after
entry
of
this
court's
order
setting
this
hearing.
these
intervenors
are
the
three
state
commissions
of
idaho,
oregon,
and
washington.
and
in
addition,
the
principle
gas
distributors
serving
those
states,
oil
and
gas
so
distributed
and
regulated
is
obtained
from
el
paso
natural
gas
company.
upon
completion
of
this
divestiture,
it
will
then
be
obtained
solely
from
the
successful
acquirer
of
el
paso's
pacific
northwest
division.
differing
responsibilities
and
interests
of
these
several
parties
have
occasioned
to
full
individual
participation
by
all
three
commissions
and
most
of
these
distributors
in
the
district
court
proceedings
held
during
57
days
of
trial
over
many
months.
these
parties
conducted
cross-examination
of
witnesses
for
all
nine
applicants
and
presentations
of
affirmative
evidence.
for
the
purpose
of
simplifying
the
pleadings
and
record
on
this
appeal,
these
efforts
have
been
united
now
by
their
strong
common
interest
and
promptly
finalizing
a
judgment
which
will
end
the
long
period
of
adversity
to
which
they
have
been
innocently
subjected
as
a
result
of
this
litigation.
we
urged
the
granting
of
utah's
motion
to
dismiss
its
appeal.
in
so
doing,
i
speak
not
only
for
the
four
commissions
and
distribution
company
counsel
who
are
present
today
but
also
for
those
who
are
unable
to
be
present
in
stating
to
you
that
these
intervenors
agreed.
first,
that
the
district
court's
decision
fully
complies
with
your
mandate
in
cascade
et
al.
versus
el
paso
and
second,
that
the
district
court
selected
the
most
highly
qualified
applicant
to
achieve
the
objectives
of
such
mandate
in
the
shortest
possible
time.
like
mr.
payne,
we
do
not
question
this
court's
authority
to
reexamine
its
mandate
and
compliance
with
it.
we
do
urge
however
that
your
review
be
confined
to
the
question
whether
the
mandate
has
been
carried
out
upon
the
record
before
this
court.
the
allegations
of
so-called
facts
contained
in
the
all
two
recent
pleadings
of
the
self-styled
protector
of
the
public
and
amicus
curiae
would
not
seem
fit
to
comply
with
the
rules
of
practice
must
not
be
permitted
a
status
equal
to
the
findings
of
a
judge
who
was
carefully
handpicked
if
you
will
to
hear
this
case.
findings
based
on
a
record
at
some
15,000
pages
which
was
compiled
by
responsible
counsel
and
their
witnesses
representing
33
parties
and
applications.
we
are
highly
concerned
over
the
prospect
that
such
findings
could
be
upset
by
these
presumptuous
and
tardy
challenges
founded
only
upon
contentions
contained
in
utah's
jurisdictional
statement
and
as
these
persons
have
stated
themselves
a
glance
at
a
map
of
the
west.
far
from
being
spokesman
for
the
public
which
mr.
bennett
emphatically
is
not
as
to
any
pacific
northwest
gas
consumers,
mr.
bennett
seeks
to
prolong
indefinitely
a
cause
whose
continuance
could
only
read
further
injury
on
those
directly
dependent
on
el
paso
pacific
northwest
division.
we
can
only
conjecture
as
to
his
reasons
for
this
but
it
is
noteworthy
that
he
did
not
present
evidence
on
the
record
below
to
support
his
belated
contentions.
where
was
he,
we
may
ask
while
the
several
intervenors
and
others
were
busy
in
court
examining
into
possible
conflicts
of
interests,
possible
antitrust
implications,
the
extent
of
independence
from
el
paso
of
the
proposed
acquirer
and
other
pertinent
factors
bearing
on
the
relative
qualifications
of
the
applicants.
likewise,
we
can
only
conjecture
as
to
his
contentions
concerning
our
position
in
support
of
the
judgment
below.
we
do
state
however
that
any
implications
that
these
intervenors
were
bought
off
are
wholly
without
foundation
in
fact.
if
we
had
any
doubt
about
the
propriety
of
the
lower
court's
decision
we
would
not
in
view
of
our
complete
defendants
upon
an
urgent
need
for
adequate
in
increasing
gas
supplies
which
only
are
fully
qualified
applicant
can
furnish
us
to
be
here
urging
the
finality
of
the
selection
of
cig.
your
guidelines
have
been
met.
the
district
court
selected
the
most
viable
available
entity
capable
of
serving
the
existing
and
potential
customers
in
the
pacific
northwest,
and
at
the
same
time
presenting
a
practical
threat
of
competition
in
california.
conjecture
as
to
some
remote
possibility
of
curtailment
of
localized
competition
has
no
place
in
the
present
proceedings.
an
adequate
remedy
exists
when
and
as
such
may
in
the
future
be
proven
not
just
surmised
by
persons
not
participants
in
the
hearings
below.
as
a
practical
matter,
no
competition
has
ever
been
provided
or
threatened
by
its
cig
in
the
pacific
northwest
or
california.
likewise,
as
a
practical
matter,
cig
by
reason
of
its
size,
financial
condition
and
experience
will
post
after
acquisition
of
the
pacific
northwest
assets
a
threat
to
the
giant
(inaudible)
of
el
paso,
pacific
gas
transmission
company,
and
trans
western
pipeline
company.
to
now
select
in
substitute
an
embryonic
entity
in
cig
instead
as
these
persons
suggest
is
to
delay
indefinitely
if
not
to
extinguish
any
hope
of
practical
competition
in
california.
for
any
such
entity
must
first
developed
and
build
an
organization
to
serve
the
pacific
northwest
and
to
negotiate
from
a
position
of
strength
for
additional
gas
reserves.
such
organization
and
power,
we
submit
cig
already
possesses
the
needs
of
our
customers
were
amply
documented
on
the
record
below.
they
should
not
now
for
be
further
jeopardized
for
14
years,
the
pacific
northwest
has
sought
a
permanent
certification
for
gas
whereas
california
already
has
three
permanent
certificates
without
protected
further
hearings
which
can
only
be
detrimental
to
the
interest
of
both
of
pacific
northwest
and
california.
there
can
be
no
assurance
contrary
to
what
mr.
bennett
lively
contends
that
as
fully
qualified
an
applicant
to
cig
is
can
be
selected.

you.
