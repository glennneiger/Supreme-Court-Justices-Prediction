mr.
solicitor

in
page

of
your
brief
or
your

you
state
that
the
divestitures
to
cig
creates
a
strong
new
competitive
force
to
the
california
market,
is
that
quite
accurate?
isn't
it
more
likelihood
or
a
possibility
or
the
probability?
i
may
have
misunderstood
mr.
sonnett's
argument.

the

a

wouldn't

justice

accurate?
justice
william

yes.
justice
william

what
happens
in
this
case
mr.
sonnett
if
a
year
from

would
turns
out
that
after
all
the
studies
have
been
made,
the
surveys
that
have
been,
economic
analysis
have
been

the
search
for
gas
reserves
has
been
made,
and
continental
decides
and
is
not
going

but
why
should
we,
in

of
our

why
should
we
take
any
action
on
this
appeal
until
we
know
what
is
actually
going

happen?
justice
william

douglas
i'm
not
at
that
point
here,
i'm
thinking
about
in
order
to
get
into
california
you
have
to
go
out
and
get
some
gas
reserves,
right?
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
but
you
have
gas
reserve
too,
doesn't
it?
justice
william
o.
douglas
because
the
gas
reserve
that
you
have,
as
i
understand
the
district
court
are
sufficient
to
service
only
the
northwest
properties,
is
that
right?
justice
william

well,
i've
read
article

of

is
the

i'm
not
impugning
motives
--
justice

anything

i'm
just
saying
the
cold
reality
is
that
a

from
now
this
--
justice
william

douglas
--
we
may
end
up
where
we
started.
justice
william

i
would
think
you'd
be
making
a
strong
argument
to
a

court
not

approve
a

at

stage
in.
justice

there

justice
william

and
those

take
it
down

now?

william

not

justice
william

when
you
stated
you
had
