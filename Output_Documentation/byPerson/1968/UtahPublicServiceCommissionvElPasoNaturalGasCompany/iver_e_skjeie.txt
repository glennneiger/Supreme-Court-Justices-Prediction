mr.
iver
e.
skjeie
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
people
of
the
state
of
california
wish
to
make
two
points
today.
first,
what
is
california's
position
on
the
two
motions
which
are
pending
and
second,
what
is
the
basis
on
which
we
arrived
at
that
position.
first,
as
to
california's
position
on
the
motions,
it
supports
that
district
court's
divestiture
decree.
that
means
that
california
urges
that
utah's
motion
to
dismiss
should
be
granted
forthwith
and
secondly
that
mr.
bennett's
motion
for
a
hearing
should
likewise
be
acted
upon
forthwith
and
denied.
well,
i
used
the
word
“forthwith”
twice
involves
a
redundancy.
this
is
intentional
for
it
emphasize
as
what
we
believe
as
a
vital
passage
of
this
proceeding
as
i'll
amplify
shortly.
we
believe
and
we
are
convinced
that
achievement
of
this
court's
objective
restoration
of
competition
for
the
sale
of
natural
gas
in
california
is
and
now
perhaps
or
a
probably
never
matter
if
divestiture
is
not
completed
in
a
very
immediate
future
then
it
appears
to
us
that
the
chances
of
achieving
the
court's
objective
and
california's
objective
will
be
so
materially
depreciated
that
such
objective
will
not
be
possible
of
achievement
by
anyone
colorado
interstate
gas
or
any
of
the
other
applicants
in
the
foreseeable
future.
turning
to
the
basis
of
california's
position
at
the
district
court's
initial
hearing
following
the
cascade
decision,
the
pretrial
conference
of
june
9,
1967
it
was
indicated
that
there
would
be
purchasers
were
or
had
been
in
the
oil
gas
and
pipeline
business
and
could
contribute
their
knowledge
and
experience
and
at
such
would
be
a
real
value
in
the
divestiture
proceedings.
this,
california
found
to
be
very
true.
amongst
other
things,
the
trial
proceedings
and
the
evidence
elicited
by
these
purchasers
and
from
them
through
cross-examination
of
them
showed
several
things.
first,
it
showed
that
the
chances
of
restoring
the
divestee
to
be
named
to
a
position
where
it
could
and
hopefully
to
our
point
of
view
at
least
would
compete
in
the
california
market
were
decreasing
as
each
day
passed.
for
example,
it
showed
that
uncommitted
gas
supplies
were
becoming
more
scarce
all
of
the
time.
those
recently
developed
or
proven
as
for
example
in
the
permian
basin,
the
evidence
showed
were
being
bought
up
and
diverted
to
midwestern
and
texas
and
non-california
markets.
secondly,
the
evidence
made
clear
that
for
a
purchaser
to
in
fact
to
be
able
to
compete
under
today's
conditions
would
require
substantial
strength
or
muscle
for
breaking
into
an
established
gas
market
is
a
major,
a
very
risky
and
uncertain
and
an
extremely
costly
venture.
it
was
in
light
of
this
type
of
situation
that
california
sought
divestiture
of
not
merely
the
assets
proposed
by
el
paso
but
additional
assets
and
benefits
which
would
have
afforded
the
divestee
the
strength
to
be
aggressive
and
to
give
it
to
us
incentive
to
attempt
by
california
project.
when
the
district
court
indicated
its
tentative
choice
of
cig
an
applicant
that
we
at
the
outset
did
not
choose
because
of
its
lack
of
past
aggressive
expansion
and
because
of
the
possibility
which
have
been
suggested
that
there
might
be
a
new
section
7
violation
involved,
we
object
it.
however,
because
of
cig's
strength
and
other
qualifying
attributes
and
because
of
the
critical
need
for
a
strong
divestiture
now
and
not
amongst
in
the
future,
we
were
not
closed-minded
when
colorado
interstate
gas
offered
a
written
commitment
to
attempt
to
california
project.
at
this
point,
as
it's
indicated
in
the
response
the
type
of
response
we
filed
last
week
at
pages
5
and
6.
we
gave
thorough
detail
and
intensive
considerations
of
the
course
of
action
which
would
best
fill
this
court's
mandate
and
further
the
interest
of
california
at
same
time.
our
attorney
general
and
his
two
top
assistants,
personally,
and
i
also
had
at
least
nine
separate
meetings
with
four
of
the
five
largest
california
gas
users
with
representatives
of
our
california
public
utilities
commission
and
also
with
three
prospective
purchasers
including
colorado
interstate
gas.
it
was
in
light
of
the
views
expressed
in
these
meetings
and
our
consideration
of
the
fact
that
divesture
now
to
a
strong
divestee
was
an
absolute
essential
that
we
proposed,
and
by
we,
i
mean
the
california
attorney
general
and
spearheaded
negotiation
of
the
agreement
which
is
exhibit
a
to
our
response
and
thereafter
when
the
agreement
was
signed
by
four
of
the
five
largest
gas
users
in
california
that
we
withdrew
the
protective
notice
of
appeal
previously
filed
by
us.
i
should
like
to
note
two
things
concerning
the
agreement.
first,
it
is
patterned
on
the
step
program
contract
which
southern
california
edison,
an
intervenor
in
the
proceedings,
proposed
be
accepted
in
the
proceeding
by
purchasers.
second,
while
the
exhibit
appended
to
california's
response
does
not
itself
show
it
was
signed,
in
fact
that
is
due
of
the
lack
of
time
we
had
in
preparing
our
brief.
it
was
signed
by
the
four
that
we
have
noted.
it
was
light
--
in
light
of
this
situation,
a
situation
where
the
possibility
of
recreating
competition
in
california
was
fast
disappearing,
and
with
cig
a
strong
and
experienced
gas
pipeline
operator
willing
to
undertake
the
major
program
involved
in
trying
to
come
to
california
that
we
dismissed
our
appeal.
we
are
extremely
concerned
that
should
the
district
court's
decree
not
be
sustained
and
not
be
implemented
now
that
there
will
be
no
chance
left
to
restore
competition,
the
competition
which
this
court
in
california
both
sought
and
seek.
accordingly,
it
is
our
position
and
we
urge
the
court
to
sustain
judge
chilson's
decree
by
granting
utah's
motion
and
denying
mr.
bennett's.
thank
you
very
much.
