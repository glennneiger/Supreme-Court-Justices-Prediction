justice
thurgood
marshall
isn't
also
true
that
the
trial
judge
when
he
asked
for
the
board,
they
cut
him
off
and
he
couldn't
continue
his
objection?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
was
4
o'clock
in
the
morning?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
how
many
officers
were
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
at
4
o'clock
in
the
morning,
there
are
four
police
officers
in
the
house
and
they
were
voluntarily
admitted?
justice
thurgood
marshall
voluntarily?
justice
thurgood
marshall
when
you
said
no
point
of
entry
(inaudible)?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
do
you
think
that
if
they
had
said
what
is
your
name,
you're
under
arrest,
carried
him
to
the
police
station,
they
would
have
had
to
give
him
the
miranda
rule?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
he
was
cut
off,
wasn't
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
aren't
the
police
officers
are
part
of
the
police
station?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
have
you
ever
seen
a
police
station
without
armed
policemen?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes,
i
doubt
it.
i
for
one
can
see
very
little
difference
between
four
police
officers
armed
and
holding
a
man
in
complete
restraint
in
a
police
station,
a
precinct,
the
middle
of
the
street,
the
middle
of
madison
square
garden,
or
in
his
own
bedroom.
i
think
it's
the
restraint
and
the
policeman
that
makes
it
necessary
to
give
the
warrant.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
don't
think
i
meant
in
any
of
my
hypothetical
because
there
was
any
family
around.
justice
thurgood
marshall
right,
because
he
was
no
family
there.
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
was
in
a
rooming
house.
so,
don't
you
agree
that
if
he
had
said
to
the
judge
i
object
to
this
and
cite
miranda
verbatim
with
the
citation
that
you
wouldn't
have
any
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
agree?
justice
thurgood
