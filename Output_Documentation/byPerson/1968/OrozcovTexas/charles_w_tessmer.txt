mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
mr.
chief
justice,
--
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
may
it
please
the
honorable
court.
i'm
charles
tessmer
of
dallas,
texas.
i
represent
reyes
orozco,
the
petitioner,
who
stands
convicted
of
murder
upon
circumstantial
evidence
by
jury
in
the
criminal
district
court
of
dallas
county,
texas,
with
a
penalty
assessed
that
penal
servitude
of
10
years.
this
is
a
classic
case,
presenting
a
violation
of
the
petitioner's
rights
under
the
fifth,
sixth,
and
fourteenth
amendments
of
the
constitution.
in
this
case,
the
petitioner
was
the
prime
murder
suspect,
had
been
so
for
four
hours.
at
the
time
of
his
interrogation,
he
was
under
arrest,
whether
legal
or
not
is
not
important.
he
was
surrounded
in
his
bedroom
by
four
armed
officers.
he
was
either
asleep
or
had
just
been
awakened
when
the
officers
entered
without
his
invitation
or
consent.
in
this
case,
no
new
trails
in
the
criminal
law
need
be
blazed
by
this
honorable
court.
in
this
case,
no
interpretation
of
prior
case
law
need
take
place
by
this
honorable
court.
what
we
have
here
is
a
simple
refusal
of
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals
to
follow
this
simple
words
and
cautions
of
miranda,
escobedo,
and
cases
involving
that
situation.
the
facts
in
this
case
are
quite
simple.
the
deceased
was
found
dead
at
around
midnight
at
12:30
by
a
uniformed
policeman.
a
crowd
had
gathered.
he
was
slumped
over
the
wheel
of
a
car
at
a
café.
after
some
investigation,
the
detectives
learned
that
there
was
a
possible
eyewitness
named
mary
matas.
the
police
found
mary
matas,
arrested
him,
took
him
downtown
to
point
out
where
a
woman
had
been
led
out
of
the
car
who
was
present
at
the
scene
also.
then,
they
have
mary
matas
direct
them
to
lemmon
avenue,
some
two
or
three
miles
from
the
center
of
the
city
of
dallas
and
there
mary
matas
pointed
out
the
house
where
his
friend,
the
petitioner
lived
and
the
car
that
he
was
in
that
night.
then,
the
officers
proceeded
back
downtown,
put
mary
matas
in
jail
for
investigation
of
murder,
and
then
after
this
belated
attempt
of
some
four
hours,
he
went
back
to
the
house
with
three
other
officers,
an
uninvited
entry
was
made,
except
that
there
was
an
invitation
by
an
unidentified
woman,
and
of
course
no
consent
there
under
amos,
stover
versus
california
where
federal
standards
apply.
what
we
have
here
is
a
simple
case
of
this,
the
minute
that
detective
brown
got
into
their
house,
he
admitted
that
when
he
said,
what
is
your
name
and
petitioner
said,
reyes
orozco
that
he
was
under
arrest.
he
was
the
prime
suspect.
this
was
no
general
inquiry
at
the
scene
of
an
unsolved
crime,
where
threshold
statements
may
be
used
or
even
res
gestae
and
that
the
state
of
texas
makes
no
contention
that
we
have
here
in
threshold
a
statement
or
admission
of
guilt,
or
that
we
have
a
res
gestae
statement
or
whether
miranda
applies
there
or
not.
here,
we
have
a
blatant
violation
of
petitioner's
rights.
what
happened?
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
4:30
a.m.
in
the
morning,
mr.
chief
justice.
here's
what
happened
to
petitioner.
mr.
brown
said,
what
is
your
name?
orozco.
where
you
at
the
el
farleto
café
last
night,
the
murder
scene?
yes.
do
you
own
a
gun?
where
is
that
gun?
and
brown
himself
admitted
that
it
took
two
times
of
questions
before
petitioner
said
i
will
show
you,
or
proceeded
to
show
the
officers
where
the
gun
was
in
the
washing
machine
and
another
part
of
the
house.
now,
those
are
the
simple
facts.
now,
what
were
the
fruits
of
this
interrogation?
simply
this,
if
petitioner
had
said
i'm
guilty,
i
did
it,
the
facts
develop
from
this
interrogation
were
more
damaging
in
this
circumstantial
evidence
case
than
a
direct
confession
signed,
sealed,
under
oath.
what
do
they
get
from
this
interrogation?
an
admission,
he
was
at
the
murder
scene.
four
hours
after
the
officers
knew
there'd
been
homicide.
four
hours
after
they
knew
this
was
the
prime
suspect,
his
own
friend
put
him
at
the
scene.
his
own
friend
pointed
the
house
out,
the
car.
secondly,
do
you
own
a
gun?
yes,
i
do.
no
real
admission
there.
many
people
owned
guns
and
have
a
right
to,
in
texas
in
their
own
home.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
i
don't
contend
that
it's
illegal
because
the
grant
of
certiorari
was
not
on
that
basis,
although
i
think
that
his
fourth
amendment
rights
were
surely
violated
by
this
arrest,
and
certainly
--
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
yes,
your
honor
based
upon
aguilar
against
texas,
giordenello
versus
united
states,
and
barnes
against
texas,
holding
that
miranda
arrest
in
search.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
i
have
no
--
i
concede
the
dimensional
difference
for
their
argument
concede
as
valid,
although
there
are
some
questions
under
texas
law.
our
laws
are
more
lenient
than
the
laws
of
most
states,
requires
a
critical
person
to
say
that
you
have
committed
a
felony
and
further
that
you're
about
to
escape.
this
man
was
arrested
at
home
in
bed,
a
very
unlikely
situation,
with
no
warrant,
no
search
warrant
(voice
overlap).
at
any
rate,
we
find
the
product
of
that
interrogation
was
simply
this,
the
admission
he
was
at
the
scene
of
a
murder,
the
admission
he
owned
a
gun.
after
being
questioned
of
two
times
about
where
the
gun
was,
he
finally
showed
to
detective
brown
where
it
was.
now,
what
was
the
fruit
of
this
interrogation?
the
murder
weapon
possibly?
ballistics
testimony
was
offered
at
the
trial
showing
that
the
body
from
the
deceased,
the
bullet
from
that
body
match
test
bullets
fired
from
that
gun.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
the
testimony
of
this
friend
concerning
the
altercation,
leaving
the
question
open
as
to
whether
petitioner
really
killed
the
man,
or
his
lady
friend
who
was
not
used
as
a
witness
who
was
standing
there.
the
witness
actually
didn't
see
the
shooting
but
was
closed,
and
they
jumped
in
the
car
and
he
saw
orozco
with
the
gun,
but
so
the
woman
was
there
too
and
wasn't
used
at
the
trial.
that's
why
the
court
charged
on
circumstantial
evidence,
i
assume.
now,
--
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
from
this
interrogation?
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
the
damaging
admissions,
i
was
there
at
the
murder
scene.
the
fact
that
his
car
was
identified,
the
he
owned
a
gun,
that
the
gun
was
produced
and
introduced
an
evidence
as
a
state's
exhibit,
and
further
that
the
gun
was
used
to
condemn
him
with
scientific
evidence,
ballistics,
test
shots
fire
to
that
gun
according
to
the
expert
introduced
at
the
trial
matched
the
murder
bullet
removed
from
the
deceased.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
yes,
your
honor,
all
of
the
interrogation
and
bombing
admissions
made
at
4:30
in
his
own
bedroom.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
orozco,
and
then
the
officer
--
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
and
that
he
had
been
at
the
scene,
the
el
farleto
café
(voice
overlap)
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
already.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
already.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
with
the
--
no.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
not
with
the
gun
in
his
hand,
the
gun
in
his
hand
after
the
shooting.
it
was
dark.
two
people
were
in
an
altercation
with
the
deceased
or
could
have
been
the
petitioner
and
this
--
the
woman
joan
perez,
who
was
not
a
witness
at
the
trial.
i
think
that's
why
the
trial
court
charged
on
circumstantial
evidence.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
yes,
your
honor,
and
i
think
here,
this
man
was
a
surely
in
jail
at
that
moment
when
they.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
but
he
was
surrounded
by
four
officers
at
4:30
in
the
morning
who
had
known
about
him
for
four
hours.
and
further,
they
had
time
to
take
the
man
back
to
see
and
come
back
no
warrant.
they
didn't
really
believe
he's
going
to
escape
or
let
him
go
in
that
house
when
it
was
first
pointed
out.
but
be
that
as
it
may,
here,
unless
miranda
is
to
be
meaningful
and
unless
it
applies
to
this
situation
where
the
man
is
clearly
under
arrest,
the
police
could
delay
taking
him
to
the
station
house
and
say
we'll
he's
in
own
home
and
we
can
question
him
there
without
the
warnings,
and
thereby
keep
him
ignorant
of
his
fifth
and
sixth
amendment
rights
under
the
constitution.
i
think
this
court
would
agree
with
me
that
these
rights
belong
to
the
guilty
as
surely
as
to
the
innocent,
to
the
illiterate,
the
naive
and
to
the
organized
criminal
who
knows
his
rights
and
doesn't
need
then
explained.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
that
they
caution
him
of
his
right
to
counsel.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
or
further
that
he
need
to
answer
no
questions
mainly.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
or
take
him
to
the
police
station
after
they've
arrested
him
instead
of
proceeding
with
the
interrogation
(voice
overlap).
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
well,
then
i
think
--
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
well
then,
you
would
have
an
exculpatory
statement
which
if
it
later
turned
out
to
be
true,
would
be
as
damming
against
him
at
his
trial
as
if
he
said
i'm
guilty,
probably
more
so
fabrication.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
this
is
true,
but
with
an
eyewitness
who
have
described
his
car
sitting
in
the
driveway.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
this
is
true,
i
concede
that.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
well
your
honor,
all
i
can
say
is
that
once
he
said
what
his
name
was,
the
way
he
went
and
further,
they
though
enough
about
him
to
return
twice
to
a
scene
to
order
additional
assistance,
a
squat
of
armed
police
officers
too
to
help
with
the
arrest.
they've
made
up
their
mind
to
take
him
under
arrest.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
yes,
no
question
about
--
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
no
question
about
their
knowing
that
they
plan
to
use
any
admissions
he
made
as
damaging
evidence
at
his
trial.
now,
i
point
this
out
to
this
honorable
court
that,
this
court
i
believe
said
quite
lucidly
in
the
miranda
that
or
in
escobedo
that
if
he's
deprived
of
his
freedom
of
movement
in
any
substantial
way,
then
the
cautions
must
be
given
whether
he
be
in
the
county
jail,
in
his
house,
or
in
a
taxi
cab
where
he's
being
questioned
or
in
a
squad
car
on
the
way
downtown,
unless
some
valid
exception
such
as
the
threshold
statement
or
res
gestae
which
this
is
four
hours
later
questions
no
spontaneity
there.
i
think
professor
(inaudible)
would
agree
that
this
wasn't
res
gestae.
the
governor
of
the
state
of
texas
doesn't
argue
that
at
all.
now,
i
would
like
to
point
out
further
that
the
state
of
texas
simply
argues
this
in
their
brief,
and
i
think
it's
all
we
could
argue
that
he
was
in
familiar
circumstances
or
surroundings
at
the
time
he
was
interrogated.
where
they
familiar?
boarding
house,
4:30
in
the
morning,
four
armed
officers
around
his
bed
and
he's
just
been
awaken
from
sleep,
hardly,
a
familiar
place
not
subject
to
police
domination.
i
can
think
of
--
i
can
concede
or
think
believe
that
the
police
station
would
be
less
dominating
than
your
own
bedroom
under
those
circumstances
at
4:30
in
the
morning,
surrounded
by
four
armed
officers,
no
cautions,
no
warnings,
nothing.
i
think
that's
the
state
of
texas
main
argument.
secondly,
they
wish
to
elucidate
and
use
the
doctrine
of
fictitious
waiver
that
although
mr.
barkley,
the
trial
counsel
objected
and
objected,
and
as
for
voir
dire
that
he
didn't
draw
the
trial
judge
a
motion
picture
of
miranda.
now
in
answer
to
that,
i
would
point
out
that
we
have
had
since
miranda
and
since
it
became
effective,
two
statutes
in
the
texas
court
of
criminal
procedure
that
go
further
than
miranda,
and
require
more
warnings.
they
are
namely
article
15.17
and
article
3022.
15.17
requires
that
he
be
taken
before
a
magistrate
as
soon
as
possible,
and
there
given
the
cautions,
then
a
constitutionally
admissible,
admission
or
statement
may
be
used.
article
3022
provides
that
the
officer
who
takes
the
statement
must
repeat
and
give
the
same
warnings,
and
they
go
beyond
miranda.
so,
there's
no
argument
that
can
reasonably
be
made
that
the
trial
judge
didn't
know
what
mr.
barkley's
talking
about.
i
think
he
certainly
presumed
to
know
the
import
of
miranda
and
the
statutes.
now,
what
do
i
mean
by
fictitious
waiver
argument?
many
decisions
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
have
applied
the
doctrine
and
refused
to
accept
it
to
racial
discrimination
in
the
selection
of
juries.
most
states
required
to
make
the
motion
beforehand,
before
you
select
the
jury
to
quash
it,
and
put
in
evidence.
numerous
decisions
hold
that
it
maybe
may
just
laid
his
own
appeal.
you
have
here
a
constitutional
right,
a
constitutional
violation
and
therefore,
state
procedural
grounds
may
not
washout
that
right,
eventhough
it's
admirable
to
have
state
criminal
process
move
quickly,
but
where
you
have
justice
on
one
side
and
constitutional
rights,
now
this
magnitude
unknown
the
other
the
question
of
whether
you
timely
objected
or
you
were
just
a
little
late,
or
you
didn't
grow
a
motion
picture
of
the
objection,
i
think
that
the
decision
in
o'conner
versus
ohio
is
recognized
that
the
constitutional
right
may
not
be
waived
on
that
basis,
also
in
the
decision
of
fahy
versus
connecticut
where
there
was
a
violation
of
the
petitions
fourth
amendment
rights
and
he
took
the
stand
and
admitted
certain
things,
still
the
finding
of
the
paint
in
the
garage
where
he
marked
the
swastika
on
the
synagogue
was
a
right
he
could
complain
about.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
i
don't
believe
so.
now,
i
would
further
point
out
that
this
honorable
court
--
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
he
continued
to
object
throughout
in
the
record.
he
did
not
say
miranda
versus
--
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
he
continued
to
object
to
all
of
the
interrogation.
in
the
record,
it's
in
the
appendix
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
we
have
it
there,
i'm
certain
i
read
it,
reread
it
this
morning,
a
careful
reading
was
shown
on
the
voir
dire.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
the
state
says
that
he
didn't
object
specifically,
no
mr.
justice
black.
and
they
cite
4009
of
the
texas
code
of
criminal
procedure.
they
do
not
cite
400913
which
allows
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals
to
consider
any
constitutional
error
or
any
error
in
the
interest
of
justice.
now,
the
answer
to
this
argument
simply
is
this,
that
texas
court
did
consider,
and
the
majority
opinion
written
by
his
honorable
judge
woodley.
they
did
discuss
miranda,
and
they
sought
to
rely
upon
decision
where
you
asked
the
suspect,
what
do
you
have
in
a
truck?
and
he
says,
cigarettes,
there,
you
have
a
search
after
that,
not
miranda
protected
on
the
street.
the
man
wasn't
a
suspect,
that's
the
answer
to
that.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
he
certainly
did
cut
him
off,
overruled
him
and
would
not
allow
him
a
second
voir
dire
of
the
witness.
and
mr.
justice
marshall,
all
of
these
took
place
in
the
presence
of
the
jury,
which
of
course
as
lawyers,
we
all
know
can
be
very
damaging
where
you
are
asserting
constitutional
rights
in
front
of
layman
who
don't
understand
there
are
certain
rules
to
be
availed.
now,
i
would
further
point
out
that
in
our
petition
for
the
writ,
our
supporting
brief,
we
point
out
the
wong
sun
decision,
the
silverthorne
lumber
company
versus
u.s.
and
decisions
of
that
appeal
which
present
the
fruit
of
the
poison
tree
doctrine
and
certainly
what
came
of
this
illegal
interrogation,
damaging
admissions,
i
was
at
the
scene
of
a
murder,
i
want
a
gun,
the
gun
itself
and
acting
out
a
nonverbal
confession
in
getting
the
gun.
it's
like
a
reenactment
of
a
murder
scene
by
suspect,
and
the
ballistics'
evidence
which
follow.
so,
i
think
that
in
view
of
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
we
simply
have
here
a
simple
failure
of
our
court
of
last
resort
of
texas
to
follow
the
simple
words
and
guidelines
set
down
by
this
honorable
court.
we
therefore
respectfully
submit
that
this
conviction
should
be
reversed
and
a
new
trial
awarded.
in
conclusion,
i
can
think
of
no
other
case
that
presents
a
clear
picture
of
the
fictitious
waiver
doctrine
as
used
to
washout
constitutional
rights
by
some
courts
than
loubet
against
bennett
365
f.
2d
695
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
involving
a
state
prosecution
in
the
state
of
texas.
if
there
are
no
questions,
i
have
nothing
further.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
by
way
of
brief
rejoinder,
the
record
is
not
clear
on
the
identity
of
the
woman
who
admitted
the
police.
there
was
no
evidence
that
she
was
landlady
or
whatever
the
case
may
be.
further,
i
would
like
to
point
out
briefly
that
when
the
objections
were
made
numerously
over
some
seven
pages
of
the
record
by
mr.
barkley,
he
used
the
word
“predicate”
and
predicate
means
what
must
be
shown
prior
to
using
the
evidence
authenticating
a
document,
proving
up
a
letter.
now
certainly,
any
trial
judge
is
presumed
to
know
that
a
predicate
for
admissions
these
damaging
must
be
a
compliance
with
the
caution.
further,
had
there
been
no
objection
at
all
by
trial
counsel,
then
i
think
the
only
waiver
that
you
could
you
have
in
that
situation
would
be
that
it
was
concurred
in
by
the
accused
or
at
least
it
was
trial
strategy.
in
henry
versus
mississippi,
the
first
submission,
this
honorable
court
held
that
fourth
amendment
rights
weren't
necessarily
waived
by
failure
of
the
mississippi
attorney
to
object,
and
i
believe
the
case
was
remanded
for
a
hearing
to
determine
why
he
failed
to
object
to
an
illegal
search
and
seizure.
if
there
are
no
questions,
thank
you,
your
honors,
very
much.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
mr.
chief
justice,
--
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
may
it
please
the
honorable
court.
i'm
charles
tessmer
of
dallas,
texas.
i
represent
reyes
orozco,
the
petitioner,
who
stands
convicted
of
murder
upon
circumstantial
evidence
by
jury
in
the
criminal
district
court
of
dallas
county,
texas,
with
a
penalty
assessed
that
penal
servitude
of
10
years.
this
is
a
classic
case,
presenting
a
violation
of
the
petitioner's
rights
under
the
fifth,
sixth,
and
fourteenth
amendments
of
the
constitution.
in
this
case,
the
petitioner
was
the
prime
murder
suspect,
had
been
so
for
four
hours.
at
the
time
of
his
interrogation,
he
was
under
arrest,
whether
legal
or
not
is
not
important.
he
was
surrounded
in
his
bedroom
by
four
armed
officers.
he
was
either
asleep
or
had
just
been
awakened
when
the
officers
entered
without
his
invitation
or
consent.
in
this
case,
no
new
trails
in
the
criminal
law
need
be
blazed
by
this
honorable
court.
in
this
case,
no
interpretation
of
prior
case
law
need
take
place
by
this
honorable
court.
what
we
have
here
is
a
simple
refusal
of
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals
to
follow
this
simple
words
and
cautions
of
miranda,
escobedo,
and
cases
involving
that
situation.
the
facts
in
this
case
are
quite
simple.
the
deceased
was
found
dead
at
around
midnight
at
12:30
by
a
uniformed
policeman.
a
crowd
had
gathered.
he
was
slumped
over
the
wheel
of
a
car
at
a
café.
after
some
investigation,
the
detectives
learned
that
there
was
a
possible
eyewitness
named
mary
matas.
the
police
found
mary
matas,
arrested
him,
took
him
downtown
to
point
out
where
a
woman
had
been
led
out
of
the
car
who
was
present
at
the
scene
also.
then,
they
have
mary
matas
direct
them
to
lemmon
avenue,
some
two
or
three
miles
from
the
center
of
the
city
of
dallas
and
there
mary
matas
pointed
out
the
house
where
his
friend,
the
petitioner
lived
and
the
car
that
he
was
in
that
night.
then,
the
officers
proceeded
back
downtown,
put
mary
matas
in
jail
for
investigation
of
murder,
and
then
after
this
belated
attempt
of
some
four
hours,
he
went
back
to
the
house
with
three
other
officers,
an
uninvited
entry
was
made,
except
that
there
was
an
invitation
by
an
unidentified
woman,
and
of
course
no
consent
there
under
amos,
stover
versus
california
where
federal
standards
apply.
what
we
have
here
is
a
simple
case
of
this,
the
minute
that
detective
brown
got
into
their
house,
he
admitted
that
when
he
said,
what
is
your
name
and
petitioner
said,
reyes
orozco
that
he
was
under
arrest.
he
was
the
prime
suspect.
this
was
no
general
inquiry
at
the
scene
of
an
unsolved
crime,
where
threshold
statements
may
be
used
or
even
res
gestae
and
that
the
state
of
texas
makes
no
contention
that
we
have
here
in
threshold
a
statement
or
admission
of
guilt,
or
that
we
have
a
res
gestae
statement
or
whether
miranda
applies
there
or
not.
here,
we
have
a
blatant
violation
of
petitioner's
rights.
what
happened?
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
4:30
a.m.
in
the
morning,
mr.
chief
justice.
here's
what
happened
to
petitioner.
mr.
brown
said,
what
is
your
name?
orozco.
where
you
at
the
el
farleto
café
last
night,
the
murder
scene?
yes.
do
you
own
a
gun?
where
is
that
gun?
and
brown
himself
admitted
that
it
took
two
times
of
questions
before
petitioner
said
i
will
show
you,
or
proceeded
to
show
the
officers
where
the
gun
was
in
the
washing
machine
and
another
part
of
the
house.
now,
those
are
the
simple
facts.
now,
what
were
the
fruits
of
this
interrogation?
simply
this,
if
petitioner
had
said
i'm
guilty,
i
did
it,
the
facts
develop
from
this
interrogation
were
more
damaging
in
this
circumstantial
evidence
case
than
a
direct
confession
signed,
sealed,
under
oath.
what
do
they
get
from
this
interrogation?
an
admission,
he
was
at
the
murder
scene.
four
hours
after
the
officers
knew
there'd
been
homicide.
four
hours
after
they
knew
this
was
the
prime
suspect,
his
own
friend
put
him
at
the
scene.
his
own
friend
pointed
the
house
out,
the
car.
secondly,
do
you
own
a
gun?
yes,
i
do.
no
real
admission
there.
many
people
owned
guns
and
have
a
right
to,
in
texas
in
their
own
home.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
i
don't
contend
that
it's
illegal
because
the
grant
of
certiorari
was
not
on
that
basis,
although
i
think
that
his
fourth
amendment
rights
were
surely
violated
by
this
arrest,
and
certainly
--
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
yes,
your
honor
based
upon
aguilar
against
texas,
giordenello
versus
united
states,
and
barnes
against
texas,
holding
that
miranda
arrest
in
search.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
i
have
no
--
i
concede
the
dimensional
difference
for
their
argument
concede
as
valid,
although
there
are
some
questions
under
texas
law.
our
laws
are
more
lenient
than
the
laws
of
most
states,
requires
a
critical
person
to
say
that
you
have
committed
a
felony
and
further
that
you're
about
to
escape.
this
man
was
arrested
at
home
in
bed,
a
very
unlikely
situation,
with
no
warrant,
no
search
warrant
(voice
overlap).
at
any
rate,
we
find
the
product
of
that
interrogation
was
simply
this,
the
admission
he
was
at
the
scene
of
a
murder,
the
admission
he
owned
a
gun.
after
being
questioned
of
two
times
about
where
the
gun
was,
he
finally
showed
to
detective
brown
where
it
was.
now,
what
was
the
fruit
of
this
interrogation?
the
murder
weapon
possibly?
ballistics
testimony
was
offered
at
the
trial
showing
that
the
body
from
the
deceased,
the
bullet
from
that
body
match
test
bullets
fired
from
that
gun.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
the
testimony
of
this
friend
concerning
the
altercation,
leaving
the
question
open
as
to
whether
petitioner
really
killed
the
man,
or
his
lady
friend
who
was
not
used
as
a
witness
who
was
standing
there.
the
witness
actually
didn't
see
the
shooting
but
was
closed,
and
they
jumped
in
the
car
and
he
saw
orozco
with
the
gun,
but
so
the
woman
was
there
too
and
wasn't
used
at
the
trial.
that's
why
the
court
charged
on
circumstantial
evidence,
i
assume.
now,
--
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
from
this
interrogation?
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
the
damaging
admissions,
i
was
there
at
the
murder
scene.
the
fact
that
his
car
was
identified,
the
he
owned
a
gun,
that
the
gun
was
produced
and
introduced
an
evidence
as
a
state's
exhibit,
and
further
that
the
gun
was
used
to
condemn
him
with
scientific
evidence,
ballistics,
test
shots
fire
to
that
gun
according
to
the
expert
introduced
at
the
trial
matched
the
murder
bullet
removed
from
the
deceased.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
yes,
your
honor,
all
of
the
interrogation
and
bombing
admissions
made
at
4:30
in
his
own
bedroom.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
orozco,
and
then
the
officer
--
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
and
that
he
had
been
at
the
scene,
the
el
farleto
café
(voice
overlap)
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
already.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
already.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
with
the
--
no.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
not
with
the
gun
in
his
hand,
the
gun
in
his
hand
after
the
shooting.
it
was
dark.
two
people
were
in
an
altercation
with
the
deceased
or
could
have
been
the
petitioner
and
this
--
the
woman
joan
perez,
who
was
not
a
witness
at
the
trial.
i
think
that's
why
the
trial
court
charged
on
circumstantial
evidence.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
yes,
your
honor,
and
i
think
here,
this
man
was
a
surely
in
jail
at
that
moment
when
they.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
but
he
was
surrounded
by
four
officers
at
4:30
in
the
morning
who
had
known
about
him
for
four
hours.
and
further,
they
had
time
to
take
the
man
back
to
see
and
come
back
no
warrant.
they
didn't
really
believe
he's
going
to
escape
or
let
him
go
in
that
house
when
it
was
first
pointed
out.
but
be
that
as
it
may,
here,
unless
miranda
is
to
be
meaningful
and
unless
it
applies
to
this
situation
where
the
man
is
clearly
under
arrest,
the
police
could
delay
taking
him
to
the
station
house
and
say
we'll
he's
in
own
home
and
we
can
question
him
there
without
the
warnings,
and
thereby
keep
him
ignorant
of
his
fifth
and
sixth
amendment
rights
under
the
constitution.
i
think
this
court
would
agree
with
me
that
these
rights
belong
to
the
guilty
as
surely
as
to
the
innocent,
to
the
illiterate,
the
naive
and
to
the
organized
criminal
who
knows
his
rights
and
doesn't
need
then
explained.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
that
they
caution
him
of
his
right
to
counsel.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
or
further
that
he
need
to
answer
no
questions
mainly.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
or
take
him
to
the
police
station
after
they've
arrested
him
instead
of
proceeding
with
the
interrogation
(voice
overlap).
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
well,
then
i
think
--
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
well
then,
you
would
have
an
exculpatory
statement
which
if
it
later
turned
out
to
be
true,
would
be
as
damming
against
him
at
his
trial
as
if
he
said
i'm
guilty,
probably
more
so
fabrication.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
this
is
true,
but
with
an
eyewitness
who
have
described
his
car
sitting
in
the
driveway.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
this
is
true,
i
concede
that.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
well
your
honor,
all
i
can
say
is
that
once
he
said
what
his
name
was,
the
way
he
went
and
further,
they
though
enough
about
him
to
return
twice
to
a
scene
to
order
additional
assistance,
a
squat
of
armed
police
officers
too
to
help
with
the
arrest.
they've
made
up
their
mind
to
take
him
under
arrest.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
yes,
no
question
about
--
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
no
question
about
their
knowing
that
they
plan
to
use
any
admissions
he
made
as
damaging
evidence
at
his
trial.
now,
i
point
this
out
to
this
honorable
court
that,
this
court
i
believe
said
quite
lucidly
in
the
miranda
that
or
in
escobedo
that
if
he's
deprived
of
his
freedom
of
movement
in
any
substantial
way,
then
the
cautions
must
be
given
whether
he
be
in
the
county
jail,
in
his
house,
or
in
a
taxi
cab
where
he's
being
questioned
or
in
a
squad
car
on
the
way
downtown,
unless
some
valid
exception
such
as
the
threshold
statement
or
res
gestae
which
this
is
four
hours
later
questions
no
spontaneity
there.
i
think
professor
(inaudible)
would
agree
that
this
wasn't
res
gestae.
the
governor
of
the
state
of
texas
doesn't
argue
that
at
all.
now,
i
would
like
to
point
out
further
that
the
state
of
texas
simply
argues
this
in
their
brief,
and
i
think
it's
all
we
could
argue
that
he
was
in
familiar
circumstances
or
surroundings
at
the
time
he
was
interrogated.
where
they
familiar?
boarding
house,
4:30
in
the
morning,
four
armed
officers
around
his
bed
and
he's
just
been
awaken
from
sleep,
hardly,
a
familiar
place
not
subject
to
police
domination.
i
can
think
of
--
i
can
concede
or
think
believe
that
the
police
station
would
be
less
dominating
than
your
own
bedroom
under
those
circumstances
at
4:30
in
the
morning,
surrounded
by
four
armed
officers,
no
cautions,
no
warnings,
nothing.
i
think
that's
the
state
of
texas
main
argument.
secondly,
they
wish
to
elucidate
and
use
the
doctrine
of
fictitious
waiver
that
although
mr.
barkley,
the
trial
counsel
objected
and
objected,
and
as
for
voir
dire
that
he
didn't
draw
the
trial
judge
a
motion
picture
of
miranda.
now
in
answer
to
that,
i
would
point
out
that
we
have
had
since
miranda
and
since
it
became
effective,
two
statutes
in
the
texas
court
of
criminal
procedure
that
go
further
than
miranda,
and
require
more
warnings.
they
are
namely
article
15.17
and
article
3022.
15.17
requires
that
he
be
taken
before
a
magistrate
as
soon
as
possible,
and
there
given
the
cautions,
then
a
constitutionally
admissible,
admission
or
statement
may
be
used.
article
3022
provides
that
the
officer
who
takes
the
statement
must
repeat
and
give
the
same
warnings,
and
they
go
beyond
miranda.
so,
there's
no
argument
that
can
reasonably
be
made
that
the
trial
judge
didn't
know
what
mr.
barkley's
talking
about.
i
think
he
certainly
presumed
to
know
the
import
of
miranda
and
the
statutes.
now,
what
do
i
mean
by
fictitious
waiver
argument?
many
decisions
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
have
applied
the
doctrine
and
refused
to
accept
it
to
racial
discrimination
in
the
selection
of
juries.
most
states
required
to
make
the
motion
beforehand,
before
you
select
the
jury
to
quash
it,
and
put
in
evidence.
numerous
decisions
hold
that
it
maybe
may
just
laid
his
own
appeal.
you
have
here
a
constitutional
right,
a
constitutional
violation
and
therefore,
state
procedural
grounds
may
not
washout
that
right,
eventhough
it's
admirable
to
have
state
criminal
process
move
quickly,
but
where
you
have
justice
on
one
side
and
constitutional
rights,
now
this
magnitude
unknown
the
other
the
question
of
whether
you
timely
objected
or
you
were
just
a
little
late,
or
you
didn't
grow
a
motion
picture
of
the
objection,
i
think
that
the
decision
in
o'conner
versus
ohio
is
recognized
that
the
constitutional
right
may
not
be
waived
on
that
basis,
also
in
the
decision
of
fahy
versus
connecticut
where
there
was
a
violation
of
the
petitions
fourth
amendment
rights
and
he
took
the
stand
and
admitted
certain
things,
still
the
finding
of
the
paint
in
the
garage
where
he
marked
the
swastika
on
the
synagogue
was
a
right
he
could
complain
about.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
i
don't
believe
so.
now,
i
would
further
point
out
that
this
honorable
court
--
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
he
continued
to
object
throughout
in
the
record.
he
did
not
say
miranda
versus
--
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
he
continued
to
object
to
all
of
the
interrogation.
in
the
record,
it's
in
the
appendix
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
we
have
it
there,
i'm
certain
i
read
it,
reread
it
this
morning,
a
careful
reading
was
shown
on
the
voir
dire.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
the
state
says
that
he
didn't
object
specifically,
no
mr.
justice
black.
and
they
cite
4009
of
the
texas
code
of
criminal
procedure.
they
do
not
cite
400913
which
allows
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals
to
consider
any
constitutional
error
or
any
error
in
the
interest
of
justice.
now,
the
answer
to
this
argument
simply
is
this,
that
texas
court
did
consider,
and
the
majority
opinion
written
by
his
honorable
judge
woodley.
they
did
discuss
miranda,
and
they
sought
to
rely
upon
decision
where
you
asked
the
suspect,
what
do
you
have
in
a
truck?
and
he
says,
cigarettes,
there,
you
have
a
search
after
that,
not
miranda
protected
on
the
street.
the
man
wasn't
a
suspect,
that's
the
answer
to
that.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
he
certainly
did
cut
him
off,
overruled
him
and
would
not
allow
him
a
second
voir
dire
of
the
witness.
and
mr.
justice
marshall,
all
of
these
took
place
in
the
presence
of
the
jury,
which
of
course
as
lawyers,
we
all
know
can
be
very
damaging
where
you
are
asserting
constitutional
rights
in
front
of
layman
who
don't
understand
there
are
certain
rules
to
be
availed.
now,
i
would
further
point
out
that
in
our
petition
for
the
writ,
our
supporting
brief,
we
point
out
the
wong
sun
decision,
the
silverthorne
lumber
company
versus
u.s.
and
decisions
of
that
appeal
which
present
the
fruit
of
the
poison
tree
doctrine
and
certainly
what
came
of
this
illegal
interrogation,
damaging
admissions,
i
was
at
the
scene
of
a
murder,
i
want
a
gun,
the
gun
itself
and
acting
out
a
nonverbal
confession
in
getting
the
gun.
it's
like
a
reenactment
of
a
murder
scene
by
suspect,
and
the
ballistics'
evidence
which
follow.
so,
i
think
that
in
view
of
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
we
simply
have
here
a
simple
failure
of
our
court
of
last
resort
of
texas
to
follow
the
simple
words
and
guidelines
set
down
by
this
honorable
court.
we
therefore
respectfully
submit
that
this
conviction
should
be
reversed
and
a
new
trial
awarded.
in
conclusion,
i
can
think
of
no
other
case
that
presents
a
clear
picture
of
the
fictitious
waiver
doctrine
as
used
to
washout
constitutional
rights
by
some
courts
than
loubet
against
bennett
365
f.
2d
695
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
involving
a
state
prosecution
in
the
state
of
texas.
if
there
are
no
questions,
i
have
nothing
further.
mr.
charles
w.
tessmer
by
way
of
brief
rejoinder,
the
record
is
not
clear
on
the
identity
of
the
woman
who
admitted
the
police.
there
was
no
evidence
that
she
was
landlady
or
whatever
the
case
may
be.
further,
i
would
like
to
point
out
briefly
that
when
the
objections
were
made
numerously
over
some
seven
pages
of
the
record
by
mr.
barkley,
he
used
the
word
“predicate”
and
predicate
means
what
must
be
shown
prior
to
using
the
evidence
authenticating
a
document,
proving
up
a
letter.
now
certainly,
any
trial
judge
is
presumed
to
know
that
a
predicate
for
admissions
these
damaging
must
be
a
compliance
with
the
caution.
further,
had
there
been
no
objection
at
all
by
trial
counsel,
then
i
think
the
only
waiver
that
you
could
you
have
in
that
situation
would
be
that
it
was
concurred
in
by
the
accused
or
at
least
it
was
trial
strategy.
in
henry
versus
mississippi,
the
first
submission,
this
honorable
court
held
that
fourth
amendment
rights
weren't
necessarily
waived
by
failure
of
the
mississippi
attorney
to
object,
and
i
believe
the
case
was
remanded
for
a
hearing
to
determine
why
he
failed
to
object
to
an
illegal
search
and
seizure.
if
there
are
no
questions,
thank
you,
your
honors,
very
much.
