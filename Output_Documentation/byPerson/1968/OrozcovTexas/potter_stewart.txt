justice
potter
stewart
and
just
what
was
introduced
in
evidence
at
the
trial?
justice
potter
stewart
so,
what
was
--
what
resulting
from
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
from
this
interrogation
was
used
at
the
trial
(voice
overlap)
justice
potter
stewart
the
gun
was
introduced
an
evidence?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
testimony
of
the
arresting
officer?
justice
potter
stewart
what?
that
his
name
was
what
--
that
his
name
was
orozco?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
he
owned
the
gun
and
that
he'd
said
his
gun
was
in
the
washing
machine
that
they
are
going
to
find
it
there.
justice
potter
stewart
--
eyewitnesses
have
put
him
at
the
scene
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
with
the
gun
in
his
hand?
justice
potter
stewart
not?
justice
potter
stewart
circumstantial
evidence.
justice
potter
stewart
no,
your
honor.
she
was
evidently
an
eyewitness
who
could've
elucidated
the
transaction
for
both
sides.
now,
we
rely
without
any
further
discussion
upon
miranda
and
the
guidelines
which
are
so
simple
set
out
therein
and
escobedo.
justice
potter
stewart
miranda
had
to
do
with
--
itself
had
to
do
with
interrogation
in
a
jail
or
in
a
police
station.
justice
potter
stewart
he
was
in
his
own
bed
in
his
own
home?
justice
potter
stewart
your
position
is
that
the
police
should
have
done
--
that
the
constitution
required
its
police
to
what?
justice
potter
stewart
and
send
for
a
lawyer
for
him?
justice
potter
stewart
what
if
he'd
said,
my
name
is
john
smith?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
as
you
say
they
--
as
you
emphasized
many
times,
they
--
he
was
suspected
of
having
just
killed
the
man
in
cold
blood,
wouldn't
he?
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
not
unreasonable
to
ask
for
a
little
additional
help
on
your
arresting
somebody
like
that.
justice
potter
stewart
you
agree
with
him?
justice
potter
stewart
you
don't
agree
completely
with
him?
justice
potter
stewart
you
got
a
form
of
search
warrant
down
there
you
use,
don't
you
in
all
cases?
that's
the
impression
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
well
as
i
read
the
appendix,
the
--
he
was
arrested
after
he
stated
his
name?
justice
potter
stewart
up
until
then,
they
were
just
--
they
didn't
know
he
was,
isn't
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
when
he
said
his
name
and
the
officer
said
at
that
point
he's
under
arrest
because
they
had
evidence
to
the
man
by
that
name
that
just
shot
and
kill
somebody,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
when
you're
talking
about
the
waiver,
you're
not
talking
about
the
waiver
by
mr.
orozco
at
that
time
of
the
interrogation?
justice
potter
stewart
you're
talking
about
waiver
at
the
trial
by
his
counsel?
justice
potter
stewart
your
appellate
court
of
your
state
could
have
said
this
federal
question
was
never
raised
and
therefore
--
justice
potter
stewart
never
properly
raise
and
therefore
we
will
not
consider
it
and
that
might
have
been
a
perfectly
good
ground.
but
in
fact,
they
did
consider
miranda
and
escobedo
and
everything
else.
they
did
consider
the
federal
question
and
pass
on
it.
so,
doesn't
that
as
justice
harlan
says
(voice
overlap)?
justice
potter
stewart
your
texas
appellate
court
considered
and
passed
on
the
federal
constitutional
question,
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
and
just
what
was
introduced
in
evidence
at
the
trial?
justice
potter
stewart
so,
what
was
--
what
resulting
from

from

interrogation
was
used
at

(voice
