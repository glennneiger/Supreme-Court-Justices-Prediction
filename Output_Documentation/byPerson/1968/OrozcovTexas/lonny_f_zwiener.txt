mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i'm
lonny
zwiener,
representing
the
respondent.
i'm
an
assistant
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
texas.
i
agree
with
counsel
for
the
petitioner.
i
think
the
main
question
in
this
case
involves
the
interpretation
of
miranda
and
what
that
holds.
i
would
like
to
point
out
initially
that
--
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
--
that
it
involves
a
miranda
question,
and
i
don't
--
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
no,
sir,
i
just
go
that
far.
as
a
miranda
i
think
is
decisive
of
a
decision
in
this
case.
i
would
like
to
initially
point
out
that
the
entry
which
he
condemned
that
at
least
mile
they
enter
the
rooming
house,
the
record
does
show
that
the
police
were
admitted
by
a
woman.
this
was
not
explored
for
either
by
the
defense
or
the
prosecution
but
apparently
they
did
not
force
an
entry
into
the
rooming
house.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
did
not
force
an
entry
into
the
rooming
house.
they
--
this
was
a
rooming
house
were
petitioner
was
located.
apparently,
he
was
a
boarder
there,
although
the
record
is
not
clear
on
that
point.
what
the
record
does
show
that
a
woman
admitted
the
officers
to
the
rooming
house.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
yes,
sir.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
there
were
two
detectives
that
had
done
the
investigatory
work
and
they
were
joined
by
two
policemen
at
about
the
time
they
arrived
at
town
--
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
well,
i
would
--
i
say
the
record
does
not
show
this
mr.
justice
marshall
--
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
i
would
say
that
this
is
exactly
what
happened.
i
think
they
were
admitted
by
the
landlady.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
yes.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
like
that
contention,
i
certainly
don't
like
it.
i
was
replying
really
to
the
suggestion
or
it
may,
i
may
have
misunderstood
the
counsel
that
there
was
something
perhaps
the
improper
about
the
initial
entry.
now
certainly,
she
does
not
--
would
not
contend
that
she
can
permit
the
officers
to
search
or
enter
apartments
in
the
house
or
--
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that
that
is
true.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
we
have
several
cases
pending
before
this
court
now.
i
will
not
mention
their
names
where
there
are
far
too
many
search
warrants.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
no,
however,
there
are
some,
some
counties
have
been
inclined
to
use
form
of
search
warrants.
unfortunately,
the
case
that
i
alluded
to,
this
court
denied
certiorari
in
the
case
involving
a
type
of
search
warrant
and
the
officer
seized
on
this
is
the
--
a
stamp
of
approval
that
it
run
with
that
type
ever
since.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
well,
i
don't
know,
your
honor.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
well,
your
honor,
i
was
speaking
to
the
initial
entry
to
the
house.
actually,
i
don't
think
that
this
is
the
critical.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
well,
your
honor,
i
don't
know
what
right
did
she
have,
your
honor.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
i
would,
might
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
your
honor.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
i'm
sorry
that
i
got
off
in
the
entry
because
as
before,
i
think
counsel
and
i
agreed
that
the
entry
and
the
arrest
is
not
really
the
controlling
thing.
i
do
think
there
were
certainly
probably
cause
to
make
the
arrest
to
this
particular
juncture
(voice
overlap).
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
yes
sir,
and
this
of
course
is
what
gives
us
perhaps
the
fact
that
there
was
probable
cause,
raises
into
the
state's
focus,
this
miranda
problem
because
certainly
(voice
overlap)
it
had
focus
on
a
certain
man
that
was
at
this
café.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
yes
sir,
he
was.
but
what
i
was
saying
that
the
fact
that
there
was
probable
cause,
meant
it
suspicion,
had
focus
on
and
this
brings
into
play
miranda
even
more
strongly
(voice
overlap).
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
that's
true.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
well,
that
is
true.
this
(voice
overlap)
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
that's
true
sir.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
well,
--
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
your
honor,
i
don't
know.
the
police
officer
did
state
that
after
he
identified
himself,
that
he
was
--
he
considered
that
he
was
under
arrest.
i'm
not
sure
that
that's
the
term
he
did.
what
the
police
officer
says,
i
think
the
court
can
look
forth
into
the
facts
and
perhaps
judge
that
not
only
is
the
name
necessary
but
when
you're
on
the
scene
of
the
crime
and
so
forth.
but
actually
--
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
no,
no.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
yes,
sir.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
i
say
the
police
officer
so
testified.
i
think
there
was
--
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
i
would
say
yes,
it
would
be
required
with
this
qualification
which
is
the
point
that
the
state
relies
on
in
this
case.
it's
a
question
of
waiver.
this
is
our
main
contention.
i
do
not
--
we
did
mention
in
our
brief
that
this
was
not
distinguishable
from
miranda
and
that
he
was
not
at
the
police
station.
but
really,
our
principal
contention
is
that
there
was
a
waiver
here.
this
was
in
january.
the
arrest
was
in
january
1956.
this
case
was
tried
in
august
of
19
--
did
i
say
1956?
i
meant
1966
if
i
said
1956.
the
case
was
tried
in
august
of
1966.
miranda
was
handed
down
in
june
of
1966.
and
what
we're
saying
is
that
lawyer,
that
defense
lawyer
had
the
advantage
of
miranda
when
this
case
was
tried
in
august,
an
advantage
which
the
police
officers
did
not
have
in
january
of
1966.
they
didn't
know
about
miranda
at
that
time.
and
we
say
--
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
no
sir,
i
am
not.
i'm
talking
about
--
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
that's
what
i'm
--
yes,
sir,
i
am.
and
i
would
like
to
distinguish
o'connor
versus
ohio,
a
case
that
i
use
to
cite
until
this
court
sent
it
back
to
or
it
went
back
to
ohio
and
came
back
up
here
that
there
could
be
a
waiver
of
constitutional
rights.
o'connor,
i
believe
this
court
said
that
if
the
right
was
unknown
to
defense
counsel,
defense
counsel
could
not
be
expected
urgent
--
this
constitutional
right,
later
define.
in
this
case,
the
constitutional
right
was
defined
some
two
months
prior
to
this
trial.
and
we're
saying
that
counsel
did
--
did
make
objections
but
he
seemed
to
be
objecting
on
an
entirely
different
basis
than
miranda.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
no,
i
don't
think
he
was
your
honor.
he
was
given
the
witness
on
voir
dire
and
he
examined
him
on
voir
dire.
and
then
at
a
later
point,
after
the
state
was
taking
him,
had
the
witness
back,
he
made
objections
and
he
said
“well,
can
i
have
him
in
voir
dire?
not
at
this
time
or
something
like
this.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
now,
you're
referring
to
exactly
what
your
honor,
what
statement
--
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
at
page
17,
is
i
would
call
it
a
cumulative
objection.
around
in
the
middle
of
page,
mr.
barkley,
“alright
now
at
this
time
we'll
object
to
any
testimony”
and
with
reference
to
the
conversation,
it
then
goes
on
to
relate
his
objections.
he
says
it
failed
probably
--
a
proper
predicate.
he
objected
to
the
amount
of
the
arrest,
and
that
the
--
whatever
this
means,
it
failed
to
comport
with
the
court
of
grounded
procedure
and
that
the
prosecution
fail
to
show
why
he
did
not
get
arrest
or
search
warrant.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
well
your
honor,
i
would
be
less
than
candid
if
i
didn't
think
they
were
difficulties
in
this
case.
certainly,
there
are.
so
that's
(voice
overlap)
yes,
sir?
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir?
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
no
sir,
i
don't
think
that
it
necessary
(voice
overlap)
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
never
properly
raise.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
well,
i
would
not
concede
that
it
would.
i
think
that
if
i
have
been
right
the
opinion,
i
would
have
written
on
a
different
basis,
i
will
distinguish
miranda
differently.
it
possibly
would
present
a
case
for
a
reinterpretation
of
the
law
by
the
court,
but
i
don't
think
that
it
necessarily
does,
was
it
point
out.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
i'm
not
--
i
hate
to
be
evasive
with
the
court.
i
--
and
i
hate
to
make
this
statement
that
i'm
going
to
make
too
because
i
would
hate
for
the
--
this
court's
right
to
opinion
with
the
assistant
attorney
general
is
not
quite
sure
what
basis.
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
decided
this
case.
but
in
fairness,
i
am
not
exactly
sure
how
they
arrive
at
their
decision.
i
think
they
just
decided
that
--
well,
i
have
some
difficulty.
i
trust
that
these
words
will
not
come
back
in
the
opinion,
but
i
do
have
difficulty
rationalizing
their
decision.
actually,
the
majority
ended
dissent.
what
i
do
nevertheless,
i
do
urge
that
counsel
should
have
pointed
out
with
some
particularity,
what
he
was
meaning
if
had
the
miranda
in
mind
at
the
time
of
the
state
trial,
what
it
was
that
he
was
objecting
to
so
that
the
trial
court
could
have
been
apprised
with
the
miranda
question
and
this
matter
could
be
--
could
have
been
corrected
and
cured
at
that
time
because
i
think
the
case
could
have
been
tried
in
one
without
the
use
of
this
testimony
and
actually
without
the
gun
that
was
seized
at
the
rooming
house,
and
had
that
objection
been
made,
had
that
trial
court
had
the
opportunity
to
past
on
it,
then
perhaps
that
they
say
the
conviction
would
have
been
had
in
this
matter,
will
not
have
gone
this
far.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
well,
this
was
not
in
a
police
station,
your
honor.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
this
--
the
interrogation
did
not
take
place
in
the
police
station.
in
candor,
i
cannot
distinguish
miranda.
that's
the
reason
i'm
arguing
waiver.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
no,
i
wouldn't
say
that
your
honor.
i
suppose
by
definition
we
could
make
them
--
they
could
make
any
little
place
if
they
happen
to
be
a
part
of
the
police
station,
but
i
would
not
say
it.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
a
police
station?
i
don't
know
that
i
have,
your
honor.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
well,
i
would
say
that
i
don't
agree
with
all
of
that
because
i
would
say
if
you're
in
restraint
with
members
of
your
family,
members
of
this
supreme
court
(voice
overlap)
it
would
make
a
big
difference
on
the
coercive
present
pressures
that
the
police
would
apply
(voice
overlap).
four
policemen
had
a
man
in
custody
in
this
court.
i
don't
think
he
would
be
inclined
to
confess.
(voice
overlap)
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
well
your
honor,
you
were
saying
wherever
(voice
overlap)
in
this
particular
case,
i
don't
see
much
difference.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
that's
true.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
yes,
sir,
i
would
say
so.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
we're
arguing
waiver,
that's
our
principal
contention
here
that
the
trial
court
should
have
had
the
opportunity
to
pass
on
the
miranda
question
at
that
time
as
so
to
--
so
that
this
issue
would
not
be
litigated
at
this
point.
if
there
are
no
other
questions,
thank
you.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i'm
lonny
zwiener,
representing
the
respondent.
i'm
an
assistant
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
texas.
i
agree
with
counsel
for
the
petitioner.
i
think
the
main
question
in
this
case
involves
the
interpretation
of
miranda
and
what
that
holds.
i
would
like
to
point
out
initially
that
--
mr.
lonny
f.

--
that
it
involves
a
miranda
question,
and
i
don't
--
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
no,
sir,
i
just
go
that
far.
as
a
miranda
i
think
is
decisive
of
a
decision
in
this
case.
i
would
like

to
say
that
your
honor.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
i'm
sorry
that
i
got
off
in
the
entry
because
as
before,
i
think
counsel
and
i
agreed
that
the
entry
and
the
arrest
is
not
really
the
controlling
thing.
i
do
think
there
were
certainly
probably
cause
to
make
the
arrest
to
this
particular
juncture
(voice
overlap).
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
yes
sir,
and
this
of
course
is
what
gives
us
perhaps
the
fact
that
there
was
probable
cause,
raises
into
the
state's
focus,
this
miranda
problem
because
certainly
(voice
overlap)
it
had
focus
on
a
certain
man
that
was
at
this
café.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
yes
sir,
he
was.
but
what
i
was
saying
that
the
fact
that
there
was
probable
cause,
meant
it
suspicion,
had
focus
on
and
this
brings
into
play
miranda
even
more
strongly
(voice
overlap).
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
that's
true.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
well,
that
is
true.
this
(voice
overlap)
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
that's
true
sir.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
well,
--
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
your
honor,
i
don't
know.
the
police
officer
did
state
that
after
he
identified
himself,
that
he
was
--
he
considered
that
he
was
under
arrest.
i'm
not
sure
that
that's
the
term
he
did.
what
the
police
officer
says,
i
think
the
court
can
look
forth
into
the
facts
and
perhaps
judge
that
not
only
is
the
name
necessary
but
when
you're
on
the
scene
of
the
crime
and
so
forth.
but
actually
--
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
no,
no.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
yes,
sir.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
i
say
the
police
officer
so
testified.
i
think
there
was
--
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
i
would
say
yes,
it
would
be
required
with
this
qualification
which
is
the
point
that
the
state
relies
on
in
this
case.
it's
a
question
of
waiver.
this
is
our
main
contention.
i
do
not
--
we
did
mention
in
our
brief
that
this
was
not
distinguishable
from
miranda
and
that
he
was
not
at
the
police
station.
but
really,
our
principal
contention
is
that
there
was
a
waiver
here.
this
was
in
january.
the
arrest
was
in
january
1956.
this
case
was
tried
in
august
of
19
--
did
i
say
1956?
i
meant
1966
if
i
said
1956.
the
case
was
tried
in
august
of
1966.
miranda
was
handed
down
in
june
of
1966.
and
what
we're
saying
is
that
lawyer,
that
defense
lawyer
had
the
advantage
of
miranda
when
this
case
was
tried
in
august,
an
advantage
which
the
police
officers
did
not
have
in
january
of
1966.
they
didn't
know
about
miranda
at
that
time.
and
we
say
--
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
no
sir,
i
am
not.
i'm
talking
about
--
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
that's
what
i'm
--
yes,
sir,
i
am.
and
i
would
like
to
distinguish
o'connor
versus
ohio,
a
case
that
i
use
to
cite
until
this
court
sent
it
back
to
or
it
went
back
to
ohio
and
came
back
up
here
that
there
could
be
a
waiver
of
constitutional
rights.
o'connor,
i
believe
this
court
said
that
if
the
right
was
unknown
to
defense
counsel,
defense
counsel
could
not
be
expected
urgent
--
this
constitutional
right,
later
define.
in
this
case,
the
constitutional
right
was
defined
some
two
months
prior
to
this
trial.
and
we're
saying
that
counsel
did
--
did
make
objections
but
he
seemed
to
be
objecting
on
an
entirely
different
basis
than
miranda.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
no,
i
don't
think
he
was
your
honor.
he
was
given
the
witness
on
voir
dire
and
he
examined
him
on
voir
dire.
and
then
at
a
later
point,
after
the
state
was
taking
him,
had
the
witness
back,
he
made
objections
and
he
said
“well,
can
i
have
him
in
voir
dire?
not
at
this
time
or
something
like
this.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
now,
you're
referring
to
exactly
what
your
honor,
what
statement
--
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
at
page
17,
is
i
would
call
it
a
cumulative
objection.
around
in
the
middle
of
page,
mr.
barkley,
“alright
now
at
this
time
we'll
object
to
any
testimony”
and
with
reference
to
the
conversation,
it
then
goes
on
to
relate
his
objections.
he
says
it
failed
probably
--
a
proper
predicate.
he
objected
to
the
amount
of
the
arrest,
and
that
the
--
whatever
this
means,
it
failed
to
comport
with
the
court
of
grounded
procedure
and
that
the
prosecution
fail
to
show
why
he
did
not
get
arrest
or
search
warrant.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
well
your
honor,
i
would
be
less
than
candid
if
i
didn't
think
they
were
difficulties
in
this
case.
certainly,
there
are.
so
that's
(voice
overlap)
yes,
sir?
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir?
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
no
sir,
i
don't
think
that
it
necessary
(voice
overlap)
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
never
properly
raise.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
well,
i
would
not
concede
that
it
would.
i
think
that
if
i
have
been
right
the
opinion,
i
would
have
written
on
a
different
basis,
i
will
distinguish
miranda
differently.
it
possibly
would
present
a
case
for
a
reinterpretation
of
the
law
by
the
court,
but
i
don't
think
that
it
necessarily
does,
was
it
point
out.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
i'm
not
--
i
hate
to
be
evasive
with
the
court.
i
--
and
i
hate
to
make
this
statement
that
i'm
going
to
make
too
because
i
would
hate
for
the
--
this
court's
right
to
opinion
with
the
assistant
attorney
general
is
not
quite
sure
what
basis.
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
decided
this
case.
but
in
fairness,
i
am
not
exactly
sure
how
they
arrive
at
their
decision.
i
think
they
just
decided
that
--
well,
i
have
some
difficulty.
i
trust
that
these
words
will
not
come
back
in
the
opinion,
but
i
do
have
difficulty
rationalizing
their
decision.
actually,
the
majority
ended
dissent.
what
i
do
nevertheless,
i
do
urge
that
counsel
should
have
pointed
out
with
some
particularity,
what
he
was
meaning
if
had
the
miranda
in
mind
at
the
time
of
the
state
trial,
what
it
was
that
he
was
objecting
to
so
that
the
trial
court
could
have
been
apprised
with
the
miranda
question
and
this
matter
could
be
--
could
have
been
corrected
and
cured
at
that
time
because
i
think
the
case
could
have
been
tried
in
one
without
the
use
of
this
testimony
and
actually
without
the
gun
that
was
seized
at
the
rooming
house,
and
had
that
objection
been
made,
had
that
trial
court
had
the
opportunity
to
past
on
it,
then
perhaps
that
they
say
the
conviction
would
have
been
had
in
this
matter,
will
not
have
gone
this
far.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
well,
this
was
not
in
a
police
station,
your
honor.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
this
--
the
interrogation
did
not
take
place
in
the
police
station.
in
candor,
i
cannot
distinguish
miranda.
that's
the
reason
i'm
arguing
waiver.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
no,
i
wouldn't
say
that
your
honor.
i
suppose
by
definition
we
could
make
them
--
they
could
make
any
little
place
if
they
happen
to
be
a
part
of
the
police
station,
but
i
would
not
say
it.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
a
police
station?
i
don't
know
that
i
have,
your
honor.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
well,
i
would
say
that
i
don't
agree
with
all
of
that
because
i
would
say
if
you're
in
restraint
with
members
of
your
family,
members
of
this
supreme
court
(voice
overlap)
it
would
make
a
big
difference
on
the
coercive
present
pressures
that
the
police
would
apply
(voice
overlap).
four
policemen
had
a
man
in
custody
in
this
court.
i
don't
think
he
would
be
inclined
to
confess.
(voice
overlap)
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
well
your
honor,
you
were
saying
wherever
(voice
overlap)
in
this
particular
case,
i
don't
see
much
difference.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
that's
true.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
yes,
sir,
i
would
say
so.
mr.
lonny
f.
zwiener
we're
arguing
waiver,
that's
our
principal
contention
here
that
the
trial
court
should
have
had
the
opportunity
to
pass
on
the
miranda
question
at
that
time
as
so
to
--
so
that
this
issue
would
not
be
litigated
at
this
point.
if
there
are
no
other
questions,
thank
you.
