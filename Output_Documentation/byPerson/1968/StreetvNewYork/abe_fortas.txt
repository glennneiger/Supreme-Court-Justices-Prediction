justice
abe
fortas
you
know
really,
do
you
really
argue
that
state
of
new
york
could
not
constitutionally
outlaw
the
defacing
of
the
flag
by
physical
acts?
justice
abe
fortas
you
don't
take
that
position?
justice
abe
fortas
so,
it's
a
speech
element
here
that
or
the
speech
or
so
called
“symbolic
speech”
about
issue
you
here.
justice
abe
fortas
let
me
see
if
i
follow
you
because
your
concession
doesn't
dispose
in
a
matter
for
this
court,
but
i
want
to
get
your
position
clear.
suppose
you
had
here
a
statute
that
said
that,
that
should
be
statute
of
new
york
that
said
it
should
be
unlawful
for
any
person
in
public
deliberately
to
set
fire
to
and
burn
an
american
flag.
that's
all
the
statute
said,
i
understand
that's
what
mr.
street
did,
and
he
was
indicted
for
that,
no
speech
element
whatever.
you
do
not
take
the
position
that
that
would
be
a
violation
of
the
united
states
constitution.
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
i
might
question
which
you've
answered,
i
assumed
that
i
postulated
that
the
statute
did
not
contain,
did
not
contain
any
reference
to
verbal
statements
but
the
new
york
statute
does
since
you
pointed
out?
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
not
indicating
in
the
attitude
of
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
or
in
the
language
of
the
new
york
statute
in
this
respect
does
and
does
not
make
a
difference
but
you
answer
to
my
question
was
very
carefully
restrictive.
justice
abe
fortas
i
thought
chief
judge
fuld's
opinion
had
to
be
read
some
what
differently
that
is
to
say
that,
assuming
that
this
is
within
the
embed
of
the
first
amendment
the
statute
and
prosecution
here
are
within
the
embed
of
the
first
amendment
the
conviction
was
never
the
less
justified
on
the
trial
acclaimed
present
danger
principle.
that
is
to
say
that
there
was
in
the
circumstances
of
the
case
a
clear
and
present
danger
of
public
disorder
and
therefore
according
to
chief
judge
fuld,
a
--
it
was
not
–
the
conduct
was
not
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
not
unless
i
don't
argue
of
that
as
my
reading
in
your
judgment
is
my
reading
of
what
judge
fuld
was
saying
incorrect.
you've
now
advance
to
different
theory
which
is
judge
fuld
displaces
on
this
read
this
as
of
disorderly
conduct
statute
or
breach
of
peace
statute,
and
that
reading
at
that
way
you
arrive
at
this
conclusion.
my
only
question
reading
his
opinion
was
that
he
was
recognizing
that
there
was
a
first
amendment
problem
engaged
in
this
analysis
for
the
purpose
of
demonstrating
dissatisfaction
in
a
way
that
the
first
amendment
did
not
protect
this
particular
conduct.
justice
abe
fortas
excuse
me.
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
this
statute
had
said
it
should
be
a
crime
to
burn
the
american
flag
in
public
or
to
mention
the
american
flag
in
public
from
giving
a
ridiculous
case
to
illustrate,
to
explore
a
point.
suppose
that
the
information
read
and
the
officer
testified
that
we
found
the
defendant
burning
the
flag
and
the
defendant
said,
“this
is
an
american
flag.”
and
suppose
he
--
that
the
defendant
where
then
convicted.
now,
remember,
i
am
talking
here
about
the
statute
which
prohibited
mentioning
the
american
flag
in
public.
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
a
statute
be
constitutional?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
how
do
you
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
you
think
that
it
has
to
be
some
contemptuous
words
upon
the
burning
of
the
flag?
justice
abe
fortas
but
if
you
will
burn,
burn
the
flag
publicly
and
don't
say
a
word
and
you
smile
while
you're
doing
it
there.
it
can't
be
punished
under
the
laws
from
new
york
but
if
you
look
angry
why
you
can
be?
justice
abe
fortas
no,
i'm
not
talking
about
that,
i'm
talking
about
this
kind
of
a
situation.
i'm
talking
about
a
statute
of
the
state
of
new
york.
justice
abe
fortas
now,
the
point
of
to
which
i'm
directing
your
attention.
let's
forget
about
the
contempt
part
even
if
you
will
assume
that
one
way
or
the
other
whichever
way
you
think
necessary.
but
suppose
i
have
the
statute
said
that,
“it
shall
be
a
crime,
to
burn
an
american
flag
or
to
mention
it
in
public.”
and
here's
appellant
whose
arrested
for
a
burning
an
american
flag
and
saying,
"this
is
an
american
flag.”
now,
with
such
a
statute
or
on
its
face
or
as
applied
in
a
particular
case
in
your
judgment,
they
run
a
file
of
the
first
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution.
justice
abe
fortas
in
the
state
of
new
york
then
may
prohibit
mentioning
or
discussing
the
american
flag
in
public.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
for
my
point
of
view,
i
hope
i
should
not
just
my
point
of
view
and
i
hope
i'm
not
indulging
myself
only.
and
i
can
agree
with
that
statement
of
this
case.
this
is
not
a
case
of
a
simple
burning
of
an
american
flag.
this
is
a
case
where
the
information
included
words
and
that
included
the
words
which
maybe
an
objectionable
discussion
of
the
american
flag
or
objectionable
reference.
but
it's
not
simply
a
case
of
burning
of
the
american
flag,
do
you
agree
with
that
or
not?
justice
abe
fortas
and
that's
what
under
the
statute
and
you
agreed
to
that
the
statute
is
not
confined.
justice
abe
fortas
words
or
act.
justice
abe
fortas
but,
we
have
to
face
here
the
situation
which
is
not
confined
to
the
burning
or
desecration
of
the
american
flag
but
it
is
a
situation
which
includes
the
very
troublesome
aspect
of
words
speech.
justice
abe
fortas
maybe
that's
right
but
the
statute
certainly
doesn't
seem
to
be
phrased
in
those
terms
the
statute
does
not
confine
itself
to
the
act
of
burning
or
desecrating
the
united
states
together
with
such
words
or
rather
conduct
that's
would
indicate
that
this
act
is
being
done
a
contemptuous
lay
of
the
flag.
would
you
agree
with
that?
the
statute
would
talks
about
makes
it
a
crime
the
use
the
words.
not
merely
fall
as
evidence
of
intent
of
the
intent
with
which
the
action
was
done.
justice
abe
fortas
you
do
not.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
brodbar,
let
us
suppose
that
you
had
a
case
involved
only
words,
words
expressing
the
at
most
contempt
in
hatred
for
the
american
flag.
now,
with
those
words
standing
alone
fall
within
the
condemnation
of
this
statute.
justice
abe
fortas
now,
that's
the
nub
of
the
trouble
here.
i
agree
with
you
that
electro
reading
of
this
statute
would
catch
words
standing
alone
because
subsection
d
of
the
statute
makes
up
the
crime
public
relate
to
defile
or
defy
or
--
let
me
take
this.
let
me
withdraw
that.
public
relate
to
cast
contempt
upon
the
american
flag
by
words.
justice
abe
fortas
now,
if
that's
what
the
statute
says,
doesn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
and
our
question
as
whether
we
can
--
whether
we
are
at
liberty
to
ignore
that
in
effect
for
purposes
of
this
particular
case.
justice
abe
fortas
all
right,
now,
do
you
attempt
to
in
the
defense,
suppose
it's
not
divisible.
justice
abe
fortas
if
you
attempt
to
defend
the
constitutionality
of
a
new
york
statute
that
said
only
that,
“it
shall
be
a
crime
to
cast
contempt
upon
the
flag
by
words.”
justice
abe
fortas
i
see.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
then
why
do
you
--
justice
abe
fortas
right.
why
do
you
say
then
--
why
do
you
argue
then
that
the
statute
is
divisible?
justice
abe
fortas
you
know
really,
do
you
really
argue
that
state
of

could
not

the
defacing
of
the

by
physical

justice

fortas
you
don't
take
that
position?
justice

so,
it's
a

element
here
that
or
the

or
so
called
“symbolic

about

you
here.
