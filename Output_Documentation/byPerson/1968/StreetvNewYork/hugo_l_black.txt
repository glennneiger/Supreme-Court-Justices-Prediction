justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
a
connection
with
the
precise
argument
you
are
now
making.
what
do
you
say
about
this
statement
giboney
v.
empire
storage
company,
but
it
has
never
been
deem
that
abridgement
of
freedom
of
speech
or
prayers,
to
make
a
course
of
conduct
illegal
merely
because
its
a
conduct
was
in
part
initiated
evidence,
or
carried
out
by
means
of
language,
either
written,
spoken
or
printed.
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
other
words,
we'd
have
to
overrule
this.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
don't
you
have
to
reach
it,
if
you
say
that
the
conduct
itself
did
not
violate
the
constitution,
but
it
does
violate
it
because
of
the
language
use
at
the
time?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
say
that's
your
opinion
that
the
decision
would
be
the
same?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
your
opinion
that
that
judge
and
those
judges
would
sustain
statute
which
did
nothing
in
the
world
would
make
it
unlawful
from
a
man
to
speak
of
views
about
the
flag,
is
that
right?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
are
the
--
there
are
language,
the
speech
you
have
hear,
speech
mix
with
conduct?
why
do
you
have
to
defend
the
idea
that
new
york
has
power
to
make
it
a
crime
for
man
to
speak
and
say
something
bad
about
the
flag?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
why,
do
you
have
to
go
that
far
in
this
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
do
you
get
into
it
such
factual
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
your
view
are
judge
is
that
if
a
man
says
something,
make
his
speech
about
his
views,
he
has
committed
a
crime
and
that
the
first
amendment
doesn't
excuse
him?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
is
it
not
obscenity?
justice
hugo
l.
black
maybe
it
is,
i've
never
know
exactly?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
he
did
say
the
government
was
bad,
that's
the
object
to
the
first
amendment
is
to
permit
who
is
criticizing
government
and
its
institution.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
criticism.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
have
an
equal
statute
it
prohibits
two
things,
one
is
the
conduct
of
burning
a
flag,
that's
what
i
understand
with
judge
fuld.
the
other
is
it
attempts
to
condemn
a
man
from
making
a
speech
that
is
critical
or
as
you
say
contemptuous
of
the
government.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
as
a
government's
institution.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
insist
on
arguing
in
that
length,
and
so
that
is
your
whole
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
other
words,
contempt.
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
it
contain
a
separability
clause?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
talking
about
the
federal
statute,
i'm
meant
about
yours.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
they
have
in
general
rule
as
to
what's
construing
thing
as
separable
if
there
are
two
separable
crimes
in
new
york?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
would
you
say
that's
a
presumption
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
law
of
new
york?
justice
hugo
l.
