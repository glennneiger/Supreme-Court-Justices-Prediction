mr.
goldstick.
chief
justice
earl
warren
before
you
start,
i
should
have
said
that
the
orders
of
the
court
have
been
certified
by
the
chief
justice
and
filed
with
the
court
below
will
not
be
announced
thoroughly.
you
may
proceed
now
mr.
goldstick.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
goldstick,
judge
fuld
and
his
recital
of
the
facts
and
his
opinions
for
the
court
of
appeals.
it
does
have
a
little
minor
error
in
his
factual
recital
does
he
not?
when
he
says
that
your
client
told
the
small
crowd
which
collected
that
quote
“if
they
let
that
happen
to
meredith,
we
don't
need
an
american
flag”.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
went
to
the
record
pretty
carefully
yesterday
and
i
didn't
see
that
there
was
anything
to
support
the
statement
that
you're
client
as
he
was
burning
the
flag
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
put
it
off,
so
he
came
told
the
small
crowd
that
he
collected
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i'd
like
an
addition
to
that.
he
uses
some
language,
do
you
claim
with
that
purged
him?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
if
an
addition
to
burning
the
flag,
he
uses
some
language
such
as
he
does
here?
do
you
think
that
purges
him
of
burning
the
flag?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
brodbar.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
suppose
the
manner
in
which
the
court
of
appeals
decided
that
would
have
somebody
to
do
with
the
state
law
concerning
the
complaint,
would
it
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
the
chief
judge
fuld
did
say
as
it
was
pointed
out
by
one
of
the
other
justice,
“we
are
called
upon
to
decide
whether
the
deliberate
act,
the
burning
in
american
flag
in
public
as
a
protest
may
be
punished
to
the
crime.”
and
i
suppose
that
if
that
--
if
arrest
of
the
text
conforms
to
that
i
suppose
that
we
can
consider
that's
all
there
is
in
the
case
for
us,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
we
have
to
read
judge
fuld's
opinion
as
being
broad
enough
to
include
what
you
say?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
think
it
does
go
that
far?
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
is
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
this
treatment
necessarily
include
words?
chief
justice
earl
warren
can
i
say
something,
suppose
there
was
no
burning
at
all
and
i
just
say
something
contemptuous
of
the
flag,
is
that
treatment
of
the
flag?
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
common
parlance?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
then
why
do
you
say
that
it
includes
words,
if
it
wasn't
considering
anything
but
acts?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
told
me
a
moment
ago
that
you
thought
it
was
broad
enough
his
opinion
was
broad
enough
so
that
we
would
be
obliged
to
include
words
as
well
as
action.
chief
justice
earl
warren
conduct?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that's
what
i
was
trying
to
get
at,
but
i
understood
you
departed
from
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
answering
me
and
said
that
his
opinion
was
broad
enough
to
include
language
if
there
was
no
burning,
and
you
say
that
the
word
treatment
to
show
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
i
think
you've
finished
your
argument.
you've
take
a
few
time.
