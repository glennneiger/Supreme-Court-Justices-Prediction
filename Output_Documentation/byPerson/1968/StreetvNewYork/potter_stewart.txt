justice
potter
stewart
now,
mr.
goldstick,
i
didn't
quite
understand,
what
position
do
you
not
take?
justice
potter
stewart
i
didn't
understand
your
brief
to
take
that
position.
justice
potter
stewart
just
for
this
branch
of
your
argument
or
your
whole
case?
justice
potter
stewart
don't
you
think
there'd
be
any
first
amendment
problem
and
the
case
put
to
you
by
mr.
justice
fortas?
justice
potter
stewart
what
if
he
has
not
saying
anything?
justice
potter
stewart
don't
you
think
there's
first
amendment
problem?
justice
potter
stewart
don't
you
think
that's
a
communication
ended
up
itself?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
right.
justice
potter
stewart
what
do
you
think
for
that
first
footnote
means
the
last
phrase
in
it,
“that
the
provision
was
meant
to
apply
to
public
mutilation
of
the
american
flag.”
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it
means
obviously
its
means
something
you
and
i
would
have
to
agree.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
goldstick.
justice
potter
stewart
you
haven't'
--i
think
i'm
right
to
saying
that
you
haven't
mentioned
in
your
brief
or
in
your
oral
argument
that
the
possibility
of
mootness
in
this
case,
do
you
think
that's
a
problem?
justice
potter
stewart
in
your
appeal
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
but
not
in
your
brief
on
the
matter.
justice
potter
stewart
although,
he
was
given
a
suspended
sentence
and
the
period
is
now
past
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
i
understand
it
during
which
he
any
other
sentence
could
have
privacy
impose.
justice
potter
stewart
i
like
then
to
hear
mr.
brodbar
your
submission
upon
the
hypothesis
that
you
are
entirely
right
that
we
can
disregard
the
reference
in
the
statute
to
the
word
words
and
we
can
equally
disregard
the
reference
in
the
complaint
to
the
quotation
of
what
the
defendant
allegedly
said.
and
that
we're
dealing
here,
therefore,
simplicity
with
the
question
i
suppose
by
chief
judge
fuld
in
the
very
first
paragraph
of
his
opinion
for
the
court
of
appeals
simply
with
a
state's
statute
that
makes
it
a
criminal
offense
to
publicly
burn
an
american
flag.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
because
the
claim
is
that
with
which
chief
judge
fuld
had
to
deal
for
his
court
that
a
state
could
not
constitutionally
make
that
a
criminal
offense.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
then
since
i
--
perhaps
you
hadn't
finish
answering
my
brother
white's
question.
justice
potter
stewart
i
meant
to
add
to
my
question,
the
very
publicly
burn
an
american
flag
in
public
as
a
protest,
that
question
that
chief
judge
fuld
puts
may
that
constitutionally
be
punished
was
a
crime
but
it
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
then
why?
why?
that's
my
question.
justice
potter
stewart
what
is
the
equivalent
of
interest
here
or
the
or
the
common
law
interest
here?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
not
comfortable.
i
don't
believe
americans
love
their
draft
cards,
isn't
it.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
take
it
you've
read
the
court's
opinion
in
o'brien
against
the
united
states?
justice
potter
stewart
and
i
take
it
down
that
you
seem
that
the
many
pages
of
that
opinion
were
devoted
to
the
showing
of
the
public
interest,
the
national
interest
in
the
possession
by
young
man
with
their
draft
card.
justice
potter
stewart
what
is
the
equivalent
or
--
justice
potter
stewart
first
of
all,
you
of
course
have
to
argue
what
the
state
interest
is?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
the
case
of
course
was
decided
long
before
it
had
been
held
at
the
fourteenth
amendment
incorporates
the
first
amendment.
justice
potter
stewart
or
the
flag,
of
the
flag.
justice
potter
stewart
no,
as
i
understand
your
statute,
it
would
cover
this
kind
of
a
statement,
“i'm
a
very
loyal
american,
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
think
there's
nothing
wrong
with
our
nation,
i
think
it's
just
perfect.”
but
frankly,
i
think
our
flag
is
one
of
the
homiest
ugliest
flags”
--
justice
potter
stewart
oh
no,
now
wouldn't
your
statute
cover
my
hypothetical
case?
justice
potter
stewart
why
not?
justice
potter
stewart
oh,
it
talks
about
contempt
upon
the
flag,
not
upon
the
country.
justice
potter
stewart
very
contemptuous
of
its
color
scheme.
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
you
have
to
test
the
statute
out
by
what
it
might
cover
don't
you,
when
you
have
a
constitutional
question?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
mr.
goldstick,
i
didn't
quite
understand,
what
position
do
you
not
take?
justice
potter
