mr.
david
t.
goldstick
good
morning
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
david
t.
goldstick
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
from
a
conviction
of
the
criminal
court
of
the
city
of
new
york,
where
an
appellant
was
convicted
for
malicious
mischief.
and
that
he
be
filed
and
cast
contempt
upon
and
burned
an
american
flag
in
violation
of
section
1425
(16)
(d),
of
the
new
york
state
penal
law.
the
charge
was
that
he
did
willfully
set
fire
to
and
burn
the
american
flag
and
shout,
“if
they
did
that
to
james
meredith,
we
don't
need
and
american
flag”.
the
judgment
was
unanimously
affirmed
by
the
appellant
term
of
the
supreme
court
of
new
york
without
decision,
and
in
turn,
the
judgment
unanimously
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals,
judge
fuld
rendering
the
opinion.
the
statute
in
question
is
set
forth
in
page
5
of
appellant's
brief.
i
might,
at
the
halter
say
that
we
agreed
completely
with
justice
fuld
when
he
states
that
the
central
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
or
not
the
deliberate
act
of
burning
an
american
flag
in
public
as
a
protest
maybe
punished
as
a
crime.
parenthetically,
we
believed
there
was
another
issue
that
was
raised
then
and
that
is
raised
here
today,
that
assuming
that
new
york
state
may
punish
such
an
act
as
a
crime,
may
it
do
it
under
the
statute
in
question.
the
facts
are
really
undisputed,
on
june
6,
1966
at
about
5:30
in
the
afternoon,
sidney
street
was
sitting
in
his
apartment
listening
to
the
radio
when
he
heard
news
broadcasts
that
james
meredith,
while
marching
through
mississippi
was
shot.
he
went
to
his
door
to
get
an
american
flag
when
down
from
his
apartment
to
a
street
corner,
put
a
piece
of
paper
in
the
street
folding
the
flag
in
one
hand,
properly
fold
it,
put
a
match
to
it,
and
set
it
on
fire.
a
police
officer
testified
at
the
trial
that
he
saw
the
smoke,
came
over
to
find
out
what
had
occurred,
saw
on
the
street
corner
a
flag
partially
burned
and
folded
lying
on
the
ground,
heard
a
man
shouting,
couldn't
quite
make
out
what
he
was
saying.
at
the
other
street
corner
across
the
street,
heard
a
man
shout,
“we
don't
need
no
damn
flag!”
upon
identify
who
the
man
was
who
it
turned
out
to
be
the
defendant.
asked
him
if
it
was
his
flag,
the
appellant
said
“yes,
it
was
my
flag”,
and
said
the
words
“if
they
did
that
to
james
meredith,
we
don't
need
the
american
flag”.
mr.
david
t.
goldstick
now,
we
don't
know
if
factual
error
then
and
i'll
tell
why
mr.
justice,
because
they
also
testified
that
he
came
over
after
the
burning
and
that
he
questioned
the
person
street
there
at
the
corner.
now,
i
don't
know
whether
when
he
questioned
him
loud
enough
for
the
crowd
to
have
heard
the
question.
i
think
we
may
assume
that
he
did.
certainly,
we
may
assume
that
the
crowd
did
hear
“we
don't
need
no
damn
flag”,
that's
without
question.
the
other
words,
with
the
records
just
doesn't
clear
your
honor.
mr.
david
t.
goldstick
oh,
that's
quite
so.
mr.
david
t.
goldstick
oh
that's
quite
so.
the
statement
was
made
after
the
act
of
burning
was
done,
quite
so,
quite
so.
let
me
ask
the
court
if
they
will
turn
with
me
to
page
5
of
my
brief
so
that
we
may
examine
the
statute
together
and
that
i
might
point
out
what
appellant's
contentions
are
concerning
the
infirmities
of
the
statute.
i
turned
to
the
subdivision
d,
which
it
says,
“shall
publicly
mutilate
the
face,
the
file
or
defy,
trample
or
cast
contempt
upon
either
by
words
or
act.”
at
the
outset,
it
becomes
obvious
that
the
insertion
in
the
statute
by
words,
as
well
as
by
acts,
shows
us
that
the
statute
on
its
phase
restricts
freedom
of
speech.
secondly,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
word
“cast
contempt
upon”,
the
words
cast
contempt
upon,
the
word
defile,
the
word
defy,
have
speech
meanings
as
well
as
act
meanings.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
find
difficulty
in
seeing
where
the
statute
does
not,
on
it's
face,
have
an
absolute
restriction
on
the
form
of
verbal
speech
that
somebody
may
use
towards
the
american
flag
and
this
is
born
out
i
might
say
in
the
district
attorney's
brief
where
he
so
interprets
the
statute
even
in
the
court
of
appeals'
decision.
i
asked
the
court
to
turn
with
me
for
a
moment
to
judge
fuld's
decision
on
page
8a
of
the
record.
about
12
lines
from
the
bottom
of
the
page,
we
see
the
observation
by
chief
judge
fuld,
subdivision
16
of
section
1425
is
designed
to
prevent
the
outbreak
of
such
violence
by
discouraging
contemptuous
and
insulting
treatment
of
the
flag
and
i
infer
from
the
words
“treatment”
that
treatment
certainly
had
contemptuous
treatment
of
the
flag
maybe
by
word
as
well
as
by
act.
we
find
that
the
opinions
of
the
mr.
harry
brodbar
general
the
state
of
new
york,
as
cited
in
the
district
mr.
harry
brodbar's
brief,
seem
to
indicate
that
the
statute
is
prohibiting
words
as
well
as
acts.
in
fact,
it
seems
to
go
farther
even
then
the
court
of
appeals'
decision.
the
mr.
harry
brodbar
general
seems
to
feel
that
all
disrespect
of
any
kind
shown
to
the
flag
is
illegal
under
the
statute.
now,
the
point
that
i'm
trying
to
bring
to
this
court's
attention
is
that
this
is
not
a
fanciful
observation.
the
convictions
that
we
had
in
new
york
over
the
past
two
years
have
been
really
real
besides
streets
conviction.
we
had
a
conviction
in
the
riddick's
case
that
is
waiting
appeal
to
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
where
an
owner
of
an
art
store,
a
displayed
in
his
arts
store
in
the
window,
some
40
odd
constructions
of
an
artist's
protest
against
the
american
flag
and
as
judge
bissell,
observed
in
his
descent,
the
artist
is
conveying
by
his
pictures
what
you
or
i
might
be
able
to
convey
by
words
but
this
is
the
way
he
can
convey
it
best.
you'll
notice
in
our
reply
brief,
in
our
reply
brief,
we
have
a
picture
of
a
poster
and
i've
noticed
that
mr.
justice
stewart
is
taking
a
look
at
and
i
think
maybe
all
of
us
could
look
at
it
together.
at
two
weeks
ago,
a
police
officer
was--had
issued
a
summons
for
violation
of
the
statute
for
showing
an
american
flag
in
a
bookstore
window
and
replacing
on
the
field
where
the
stars
are
the
doves
of
peace,
and
the
signs
of
peace.
now
the
question
has
to
be
asked,
alright
what
does
have
to
do
with
this
case.
no
question
that
streaked
at
something
that
isn't
all
speech,
its
act
as
well
as
speech
and
alright,
suppose
the
statute
goes
too
far
but
we
should
still
be
able
to
convict
street
because
unquestionably,
new
york
has
the
power
to
outlaw
this
kind
of
conduct.
it
is
our
position
your
honors
that
even
if
this
court
took
that
position
which
we
would
not
agree
at
with
but
assumed
for
a
moment
that
we
agree
that
the
state
of
new
york
could
outlaw
this
type
of
conduct.
mr.
david
t.
goldstick
i
do
not
mr.
justice
fortas.
i
do
not
take
that
position.
mr.
david
t.
goldstick
i
do
not.
mr.
david
t.
goldstick
it
bothers
me
very
much
and
it
also
bothers
me
that
a
statute
on
its
face
that
is
so
restrictive
goes
far
beyond
the
limited
powers
that
mr.
justice
fortas
is
referring
to,
and
that
even
if
we
assume
that
it
could
do
what
mr.
justice
fortas
says,
i
quite
agree
with
you
and
all
likely
we're
going
to
probably
could.
it
can't
go
as
far
as
the
statute
and
mr.
street
is
in
a
position
to
attack
the
statute.
mr.
david
t.
goldstick
i
do
have
the
position
that
the
state
of
new
york
had
not
regulate
conduct
towards
the
flag.
i'm
saying
that
the
state
of
new
york
may,
under
certain
circumstances
with
a
properly
drawn
statute
narrowly
construed
for
the
purpose
intended,
prevent
certain
acts
of
flag
desecration.
mr.
david
t.
goldstick
you
know,
last
night
i
really
struggled
with
this
problem
myself
because
i've
been
struggling
with
it
for
two
years,
and
i
must
confess
to
your
honor
that
i
have
been
back
and
forth
on
the
power
of
the
state
to
regulate
conduct
towards
the
flag,
and
i
have
to
take
the
position
that
in
this
case
it
makes
no
difference,
whether
or
not
we
were
to
decide
that
the
state
of
new
york
does
have
such
power.
i'm
willing
to
concede
for
the
purpose
of
this
argument
that
it
does
have
that
power.
mr.
david
t.
goldstick
i'm
willing
to
concede
for
the
entire
case
that
there
is
a
limited
amount
of
power
that
the
state
of
new
york
has
to
regulate
conduct,
conduct
towards
the
flag.
mr.
david
t.
goldstick
absolutely.
mr.
david
t.
goldstick
well,
i
would
say
first,
we
may
not
even
have
to
reach
that
point
because
the
statute
on
its
face,
obviously,
restricts
communicative
acts.
so
that
--
even
if
we
have
for
example
a
statute
like
the
federal
government
recently
enacted
which
omits
completely
any
reference
to
speech
except,
i
might
point
out
for
the
word
“defile”
which
has
an
interpretation
having
speech
connotation.
assume
even
that
word
was
out,
and
we
had
a
federal
statute
in
question,
which
then
have
to
reach
the
question
there
as
to
whether
was
constitutionally
applied,
but
we
can
avoid
that
problem.
though,
i'm
prepare
to
speak
on
it
because
i
think
even
if
we
have
the
federal
statute
of
new
york,
that
particular
facts
in
this
case
would
not
allow
a
conviction.
but
assuming
for
a
moment,
that
was
the
statute
we
had,
i'm
sorry.
assuming
that
we
did
not
have
the
statute
but
we
have
the
statute
that
we
have,
we
don't
reach
the
question
because
that's
far
beyond
the
federal
statute.
i
might
point
out
that
the
honorable
ramsey
clark
and
i
realized
it
is
not
binding
in
this
court
at
any
matter
whatsoever,
but
he
still
made
a
very
have
observation
to
congress
when
they
were
adapting
their
statute
that
the
words
as
used
in
the
new
york
statute
deter
and
in
the
proposed
statute
before
the
congress
will
very
much
like
the
new
york
statute.
and
freedom
of
speech
--
mr.
david
t.
goldstick
i
do
not.
mr.
david
t.
goldstick
i'm
sorry
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
david
t.
goldstick
that
is
the
nub,
isn't
it?
mr.
david
t.
goldstick
that
is
the
nub
of
the
problem
isn't
it,
because
that
is
exactly
what
we
are
saying.
we
are
saying
also
that
even
under
the
circumstances,
these
circumstances
mr.
justice
fortas
pointed
out,
that
the
act
could
then
be
coupled
with
other
acts
that
in
and
up
itself
now
brings
it
out
of
the
simple
due
process
problems
of
a
criminal
statute
and
close
it
with
first
amendment
problems.
and
i
might
point
out
--
mr.
david
t.
goldstick
not
necessarily.
not
necessarily
because
on
its
face,
there's
no
restriction
of
speech,
but
there
may
be
as
for
example
as
apply,
the
person
may
be
doing
the
burning
and
shouting
that
united
states
is
not
belong
in
that--
mr.
david
t.
goldstick
no
words?
well,
there
is
no
--
mr.
david
t.
goldstick
no,
i
don't
see
where
the
communication
is.
there
has
to
be
a
communication
in
order
for
them
to
--
mr.
david
t.
goldstick
not
necessarily,
if
i
filled
myself
with
a
couple
of
statute,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
david
t.
goldstick
could
it
be.
the
answer
to
that
would
be
if
--
mr.
david
t.
goldstick
if
street
had
not
said
a
word
--
not
necessarily.
i'm
trying
to
get
to
the
--
to
the
not
necessary
part.
if
the
burning
of
the
act,
at
the
burning
of
the
flag
took
on
a
secondary
meaning,
for
example
if
this
was
a
protest
where
people
realized
that
the
burning
was
for
a
purpose
of
protest.
there
was
a
communication,
before
kleenex
was
on
the
market
for
example
for
number
of
years,
the
word
kleenex
has
no
secondary
meaning
but
it
got
a
meaning
because
people
got
using
it.
the
same
thing
with
draft
card
burning,
today
when
a
fellow
burns
a
draft
card
in
public,
we
very
well
know
what
he
was
doing,
it
was
usually
that
he
was
communicating
a
protest
against
the
vietnam
war.
flag
burning
hasn't
got
that
secondary
meaning
but
i
submit
it
may
very
well
get
to
that
point.
but
that
isn't
our
problem
at
this
time,
i'm
willing
to
concede
right
now
that
simply
that
--
simple
act
of
burning
the
flag
in
new
york,
but
not
under
the
statute,
would
be
--could
be
illegal
because
the
statute
goes
far
beyond
that
problem.
mr.
david
t.
goldstick
i
agree
with
mr.
chief
--mr.
justice
--
mr.
david
t.
goldstick
i
understand.
i
might
point
out--
mr.
david
t.
goldstick
thank
you.
i
might
--
mr.
david
t.
goldstick
mr.
justice
black,
i
hope
by
the
time
i
finish
today,
and
after
this
court
has
seriously
considered
the
merits
of
this
case
that
that
statement
would
not
be
the
law
of
this
land.
mr.
david
t.
goldstick
i'm
not
saying
that
because
you
don't
even
have
to
reach
that
question
because
we
have
a
statute
on
its
face
that
it
breaches
freedom
of
speech
that
you
don't
even
have
to
reach
that
problem.
what
i
am
saying
however
--
mr.
david
t.
goldstick
the
reason
mr.
justice
black,
i
say
we
don't
have
to
reach
it
is
because,
street
was
convicted
under
a
statute
that
is
unconstitutional
on
it's
face
as
being
a
obvious
restriction
on
verbal
speech,
it
says
you
can't
use
words
and
that
he
has
a
right
i
believe,
to
attack
that
statute
and
thereby
attack
his
conviction
even
though
new
york
may
well
have
the
right
to
outlaw
exactly
what
he
did.
and
i
think
thornhill
against
alabama
is
exactly
that
type
of
a
situation.
but
to
get
back
to
your
question
your
honor,
i
would
like
to
feel
that
the
issue
here
on
an
act
as
well
as
words
is
whether
a
communication
was
made
and
whether
the
communication
was
understood,
because
isn't
that
truly
the
problem
of
a
freedom
of
speech
case.
the
communication
of
an
idea
to
the
public
and
the
receipt
of
that
communication
by
the
public,
and
this
is
the
nub
of
the
issue
that
mr.
justice
black
has
referred
to,
and
this
is
the
nub
of
the
other
issue
of
this
case
which
i
freely
admit
does
not
have
to
be
reached.
but
if
reached;
should
be
decided
on
drawing
criteria
for
us
to
know
when
act
and
speech
is
speech
and
when
act
and
speech
is
not
speech,
and
therefore
not
entitle
the
first
amendment
protection.
if
i
might
digress
just
for
a
moment
--
mr.
david
t.
goldstick
yes.
mr.
david
t.
goldstick
yes
it
is.
mr.
david
t.
goldstick
he
dealt
with
it
only
on
a

i'll
show
you--
mr.
david
t.
goldstick
we
did.
and
it
was
considered
your
honor,
at
page
4a
of
the
decision,
footnote
1.
we
raise
the
entire
argument
of
overbreadth
in
vagueness
in
the
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
david
t.
goldstick
and
well,
at
the
trial
court,
i
might
point
out
that
if
you
have
an
examination
of
the
record.
as
i
was
making
my
motions,
i
was
politely
asked
really
to
sit
down.
we
never
really
got
the
finishing
making
our
emotions,
and
not
only
was
at
the
issue
to
discuss
that
the
trial
court,
but
it
was
also
discussed
at
the
court
of
appeals
and
dealt
within
that
motion.
but
i
might
point
out
mr.
justice
white,
that
the
overbreadth
argument
is
a
first
amendment
argument,
it's
not
a
fourteenth
amendment
argument.
we
raise
first
amendment
question.
mr.
david
t.
goldstick
i
would
--
it
would
be
my
understandings
provided
any
issue
on
first
amendment
infirmities
raised
and
in
any
manner
what
so
whether,
whether
be
overbreadth
or
void
on
its
face
or
improper
application
of
the
statute
would
still
be
a
first
amendment
objection
and
properly
raised
--
mr.
david
t.
goldstick
but
i
--
of
course
if
you
read
it
as
if
i
did
not
raise
it
but
it
was
raised
that
you
see
raised
in
my
motion
at
the
trial
court
i
raised
first
amendment
objections
i
said
the
statute
is
void
for
first
amendment
problems
and
judge
fuld
pass
on
first
amendment
problems
and
there
whole
question
of
overbreadth
is
first
amendment
not
a
vagueness
or
due
process
problem.
mr.
david
t.
goldstick
i
have
no
argument
with
mr.
justice
white
if
that
is
your
decision
certainly
under
the
rules
of
this
court
--
mr.
david
t.
goldstick
i
would
believe
so
that
it
does.
mr.
david
t.
goldstick
no,
not
to
and
this
case?
if
i
have
raised
first
amendment
–
as
far
as
the
overbreadth
i
would
say,
yes.
but
as
far
as
the
applications
--
mr.
david
t.
goldstick
yes,
i
would.
mr.
david
t.
goldstick
not
so
because
the
court
of
appeals
are
considered
the
vagueness
question
which
was
not
raised
at
the
criminal
court
level.
the
vagueness
question
though
dispose
of
in
a
footnote
was
still
considered.
we
have
pointed
out
that
the
statute
was
vague
because
he
never
said
what
flag
they
were
talking
about.
that
was
disposed
of
in
a
footnote
and
that
was
the
total
consideration
given
to
the
vagueness
argument
by
judge
fuld.
mr.
david
t.
goldstick
in
due
deference
to
your
honors
observation,
i
again
refer
back
to
page
8a
of
the
opinion
as
to
the
construction
and
the
statute
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
language
by
discouraging
contemptuous
and
insulting
treatment
of
the
flag
in
public
is
a
construction
given
to
this
statute
by
judge
fuld
and
i
might--
mr.
david
t.
goldstick
i
can't
answer
that
question.
mr.
david
t.
goldstick
of
course,
it
mean
something
but
i
think
there's
another
–
there's
another
answer
to
your
question
your
honor
and
that
is
simply
that
the
construction
of
the
court
of
appeals
was
not
available
to
the
criminal
court
judge
when
he
tried
the
case.
mr.
david
t.
goldstick
page
13
a
mr.
david
t.
goldstick
yes,
your
honor.
that
is
it.
mr.
david
t.
goldstick
simply
the
reference
the
first
amendment
that
day
--
we
were
engage
in
the
first
amendment
activities.
mr.
david
t.
goldstick
absolutely,
your
honor
and
i
might
say
we
have
had
it
in
a
--
mr.
david
t.
goldstick
i
might
add
your
honor
that
we
also
had
it
in
a
trial
memorandum
when
we
made
the
motion
and
the
trial
memorandum
had
a
full
point
on
overbreadth.
i
don't
have
that
is
in
part
of
the
record
but
it
was
certainly
and
i
turn
–
i
direct
you
to
page
2
when
i
was
very
abruptly
requested
by
the
judge,
“sorry
mr.
goldstick
no
more
emotions,
lets
sit
down.”
the
issue
was
briefed
and
argued
all
the
way
up
and
i'm
just
saying
that
it
wasn't
fully
treated
by
judge
fuld,
and
just
one
other
point
that
i
would
like
to
make,
if
i
may,
and
that
deals
with
the
problem
of
this
statute
as
applied.
you'll
notice
in
the
record
that
sidney
street
was
convicted
--
was
charge
with
both
disorderly
conduct
and
with
breach
of
the
peace.
he
was
acquitted
of
disorderly
conduct
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
not
a
scintilla
of
proof
that
there
was
a
breach
of
the
peace
occurred
where
that
a
breach
of
the
peace
was
likely
to
occur.
now,
judge
fuld
bases
his
decision
on
the
right
of
new
york
under
its
police
power
to
restrict
acts
that
would
cause
a
breach
of
the
peace
or
likely
to
cause
a
breach
of
the
peace.
but
its
our
contention
your
honors
that
there
was
no
breach
of
the
peace,
no
evidence
of
a
likely
breach
of
the
peace,
and
the
only
way
therefore
street
could
have
been
convicted
under
this
theory
that
this
is
a
statute
of
prevent
the
breach
of
the
peace
would
have
to
be
that
there
is
something
inherently
dangerous
in
this
type
of
conduct.
and
so
that
therefore
the
state
of
new
york
has
a
right
to
prevent
conduct
that
is
inherently
dangerous.
mr.
david
t.
goldstick
mr.
justice
fortas,
this
court
i
recommend
to
your
reading
the
record
and
of
course
under
your
power
you
have
the
right
to
review
the
record
with
regards
to
the
finding
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
i
simply
submit
that
judge
fuld's
observations
are
not
supported
by
those--
mr.
david
t.
goldstick
well,
his
analysis
if
i
understand
it,
would
be
on
base
upon
the
power
of
the
state
to
make
some
regulations
even
though
they
may
fly
in
the
face
of
first
amendment
problems
and
the
issue
then
becomes
where
is
the
line
drawn
between
what
the
state
can
do
with
regards
to
first
amendment
problems.
and
i
respectfully
submit
that
if
you
do
an
analogy
of
a
statute
as
a
breach
–
if
it
comes
under
the
breach
of
a
power
of
the
state
to
prevent
public
disorder,
then
the
analogy
must
file
--
follow
what
is
that
power
when
we
come
across
a
breach
–
when
come
across
a
freedom
of
a
speech
problem
and
the
power
has
historically
been.
and
as
far
as
my
reading
of
the
cases
in
this
court
has
always
been
has
there
been
a
breach
of
a
peace
or
will
a
breach
of
the
peace
likely
occur
and
you
will
examine
the
record
to
see
if
it's
there.
that
to
me
--
mr.
david
t.
goldstick
i
can't
answer
that
question,
i
don't
know.
whether
we
should
read
the
entire--
mr.
david
t.
goldstick
oh,
i
see
what
the
point
of
your
honor
and
i
seem
to
feel
it
that
that
maybe
so
but
does
not
mean
that
the
point
was
not
properly
raised
or
perhaps
we
--
perhaps
just
discarded.
i
can't
answer
what
went
down
the
minds
of
the
judges
in
the
court
of
appeals,
i
cannot
answer
that.
thank
you.
mr.
david
t.
goldstick
yes.
mr.
david
t.
goldstick
it
was
brief
your
honor
in
the
--
in
our
appeal
to
this
court.
mr.
david
t.
goldstick
yes.
mr.
david
t.
goldstick
yes,
and
it
really
is
not
moot
from
mr.
street
point
of
view
because
if
this
conviction
is
affirmed,
we
have
a
hearing
waiting
for
us
back
before
the
new
york
city
transit
authority
on
this
man's
job.
so,
for
mr.
street's
point
of
view
this
is
far
from
a
moot
issue.
mr.
david
t.
goldstick
yes.
mr.
david
t.
goldstick
that
is
quite
true
but
i
have
a
letter
in
my
file
from
the
transit
authority
they're
holding
up
the
hearing
waiting
the
determination
of
this
court.
thank
you
very
much
your
honor.
mr.
david
t.
goldstick
just
one
point
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
david
t.
goldstick
good
morning
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
david
t.
goldstick
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
from
a
conviction
of
the
criminal
court
of
the
city
of
new
york,
where
an
appellant
was
convicted
for
malicious
mischief.
and
that
he
be
filed
and
cast
contempt
upon
and
burned
an
american
flag
in
violation
of
section
1425
(16)
(d),
of
the
new
york
state
penal
law.
the
charge
was
that
he
did
willfully
set
fire
to
and
burn
the
american
flag
and
shout,
“if
they
did
that
to
james
meredith,
we
don't
need
and
american
flag”.
the
judgment
was
unanimously
affirmed
by
the
appellant
term
of
the
supreme
court
of
new
york
without
decision,
and
in
turn,
the
judgment
unanimously
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals,
judge
fuld
rendering
the
opinion.
the
statute
in
question
is
set
forth
in
page
5
of
appellant's
brief.
i
might,
at
the
halter
say
that
we
agreed
completely
with
justice
fuld
when
he
states
that
the
central
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
or
not
the
deliberate
act
of
burning
an
american
flag
in
public
as
a
protest
maybe
punished
as
a
crime.
parenthetically,
we
believed
there
was
another
issue
that
was
raised
then
and
that
is
raised
here
today,
that
assuming
that
new
york
state
may
punish
such
an
act
as
a
crime,
may
it
do
it
under
the
statute
in
question.
the
facts
are
really
undisputed,
on
june
6,
1966
at
about
5:30
in
the
afternoon,
sidney
street
was
sitting
in
his
apartment
listening
to
the
radio
when
he
heard
news
broadcasts
that
james
meredith,
while
marching
through
mississippi
was
shot.
he
went
to
his
door
to
get
an
american
flag
when
down
from
his
apartment
to
a
street
corner,
put
a
piece
of
paper
in
the
street
folding
the
flag
in
one
hand,
properly
fold
it,
put
a
match
to
it,
and
set
it
on
fire.
a
police
officer
testified
at
the
trial
that
he
saw
the
smoke,
came
over
to
find
out
what
had
occurred,
saw
on
the
street
corner
a
flag
partially
burned
and
folded
lying
on
the
ground,
heard
a
man
shouting,
couldn't
quite
make
out
what
he
was
saying.
at
the
other
street
corner
across
the
street,
heard
a
man
shout,
“we
don't
need
no
damn
flag!”
upon
identify
who
the
man
was
who
it
turned
out
to
be
the
defendant.
asked
him
if
it
was
his
flag,
the
appellant
said
“yes,
it
was
my
flag”,
and
said
the
words
“if
they
did
that
to
james
meredith,
we
don't
need
the
american
flag”.
mr.
david
t.
goldstick
now,
we
don't
know
if
factual
error
then
and
i'll
tell
why
mr.
justice,
because
they
also
testified
that
he
came
over
after
the
burning
and
that
he
questioned
the
person
street
there
at
the
corner.
now,
i
don't
know
whether
when
he
questioned
him
loud
enough
for
the
crowd
to
have
heard
the
question.
i
think
we
may
assume
that
he
did.
certainly,
we
may
assume
that
the
crowd
did
hear
“we
don't
need
no
damn
flag”,
that's
without
question.
the
other
words,
with
the
records
just
doesn't
clear
your
honor.
mr.
david
t.
goldstick
oh,
that's
quite
so.
mr.
david
t.
goldstick
oh
that's
quite
so.
the
statement
was
made
after
the
act
of
burning
was
done,
quite
so,
quite
so.
let
me
ask
the
court
if
they
will
turn
with
me
to
page
5
of
my
brief
so
that
we
may
examine
the
statute
together
and
that
i
might
point
out
what
appellant's
contentions
are
concerning
the
infirmities
of
the
statute.
i
turned
to
the
subdivision
d,
which
it
says,
“shall
publicly
mutilate
the
face,
the
file
or
defy,
trample
or
cast
contempt
upon
either
by
words
or
act.”
at
the
outset,
it
becomes
obvious
that
the
insertion
in
the
statute
by
words,
as
well
as
by
acts,
shows
us
that
the
statute
on
its
phase
restricts
freedom
of
speech.
secondly,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
word
“cast
contempt
upon”,
the
words
cast
contempt
upon,
the
word
defile,
the
word
defy,
have
speech
meanings
as
well
as
act
meanings.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
find
difficulty
in
seeing
where
the
statute
does
not,
on
it's
face,
have
an
absolute
restriction
on
the
form
of
verbal
speech
that
somebody
may
use
towards
the
american
flag
and
this
is
born
out
i
might
say
in
the
district
attorney's
brief
where
he
so
interprets
the
statute
even
in
the
court
of
appeals'
decision.
i
asked
the
court
to
turn
with
me
for
a
moment
to
judge
fuld's
decision
on
page
8a
of
the
record.
about
12
lines
from
the
bottom
of
the
page,
we
see
the
observation
by
chief
judge
fuld,
subdivision
16
of
section
1425
is
designed
to
prevent
the
outbreak
of
such
violence
by
discouraging
contemptuous
and
insulting
treatment
of
the
flag
and
i
infer
from
the
words
“treatment”
that
treatment
certainly
had
contemptuous
treatment
of
the
flag
maybe
by
word
as
well
as
by
act.
we
find
that
the
opinions
of
the
mr.
harry
brodbar
general
the
state
of
new
york,
as
cited
in
the
district
mr.
harry
brodbar's
brief,
seem
to
indicate
that
the
statute
is
prohibiting
words
as
well
as
acts.
in
fact,
it
seems
to
go
farther
even
then
the
court
of
appeals'
decision.
the
mr.
harry
brodbar
general
seems
to
feel
that
all
disrespect
of
any
kind
shown
to
the
flag
is
illegal
under
the
statute.
now,
the
point
that
i'm
trying
to
bring
to
this
court's
attention
is
that
this
is
not
a
fanciful
observation.
the
convictions
that
we
had
in
new
york
over
the
past
two
years
have
been
really
real
besides
streets
conviction.
we
had
a
conviction
in
the
riddick's
case
that
is
waiting
appeal
to
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
where
an
owner
of
an
art
store,
a
displayed
in
his
arts
store
in
the
window,
some
40
odd
constructions
of
an
artist's
protest
against
the
american
flag
and
as
judge
bissell,
observed
in
his
descent,
the
artist
is
conveying
by
his
pictures
what
you
or
i
might
be
able
to
convey
by
words
but
this
is
the
way
he
can
convey
it
best.
you'll
notice
in
our
reply
brief,
in
our
reply
brief,
we
have
a
picture
of
a
poster
and
i've
noticed
that
mr.
justice
stewart
is
taking
a
look
at
and
i
think
maybe
all
of
us
could
look
at
it
together.
at
two
weeks
ago,
a
police
officer
was--had
issued
a
summons
for
violation
of
the
statute
for
showing
an
american
flag
in
a
bookstore
window
and
replacing
on
the
field
where
the
stars
are
the
doves
of
peace,
and
the
signs
of
peace.
now
the
question
has
to
be
asked,
alright
what
does
have
to
do
with
this
case.
no
question
that
streaked
at
something
that
isn't
all
speech,
its
act
as
well
as
speech
and
alright,
suppose
the
statute
goes
too
far
but
we
should
still
be
able
to
convict
street
because
unquestionably,
new
york
has
the
power
to
outlaw
this
kind
of
conduct.
it
is
our
position
your
honors
that
even
if
this
court
took
that
position
which
we
would
not
agree
at
with
but
assumed
for
a
moment
that
we
agree
that
the
state
of
new
york
could
outlaw
this
type
of
conduct.
mr.
david
t.
goldstick
i
do
not
mr.
justice
fortas.
i
do
not
take
that
position.
mr.
david
t.
goldstick
i
do
not.
mr.
david
t.
goldstick
it
bothers
me
very
much
and
it
also
bothers
me
that
a
statute
on
its
face
that
is
so
restrictive
goes
far
beyond
the
limited
powers
that
mr.
justice
fortas
is
referring
to,
and
that
even
if
we
assume
that
it
could
do
what
mr.
justice
fortas
says,
i
quite
agree
with
you
and
all
likely
we're
going
to
probably
could.
it
can't
go
as
far
as
the
statute
and
mr.
street
is
in
a
position
to
attack
the
statute.
mr.
david
t.
goldstick
i
do
have
the
position
that
the
state
of
new
york
had
not
regulate
conduct
towards
the
flag.
i'm
saying
that
the
state
of
new
york
may,
under
certain
circumstances
with
a
properly
drawn
statute
narrowly
construed
for
the
purpose
intended,
prevent
certain
acts
of
flag
desecration.
mr.
david
t.
goldstick
you
know,
last
night
i
really
struggled
with
this
problem
myself
because
i've
been
struggling
with
it
for
two
years,
and
i
must
confess
to
your
honor
that
i
have
been
back
and
forth
on
the
power
of
the
state
to
regulate
conduct
towards
the
flag,
and
i
have
to
take
the
position
that
in
this
case
it
makes
no
difference,
whether
or
not
we
were
to
decide
that
the
state
of
new
york
does
have
such
power.
i'm
willing
to
concede
for
the
purpose
of
this
argument
that
it
does
have
that
power.
mr.
david
t.
goldstick
i'm
willing
to
concede
for
the
entire
case
that
there
is
a
limited
amount
of
power
that
the
state
of
new
york
has
to
regulate
conduct,
conduct
towards
the
flag.
mr.
david
t.
goldstick
absolutely.
mr.
david
t.
goldstick
well,
i
would
say
first,
we
may
not
even
have
to
reach
that
point
because
the
statute
on
its
face,
obviously,
restricts
communicative
acts.
so
that
--
even
if
we
have
for
example
a
statute
like
the
federal
government
recently
enacted
which
omits
completely
any
reference
to
speech
except,
i
might
point
out
for
the
word
“defile”
which
has
an
interpretation
having
speech
connotation.
assume
even
that
word
was
out,
and
we
had
a
federal
statute
in
question,
which
then
have
to
reach
the
question
there
as
to
whether
was
constitutionally
applied,
but
we
can
avoid
that
problem.
though,
i'm
prepare
to
speak
on
it
because
i
think
even
if
we
have
the
federal
statute
of
new
york,
that
particular
facts
in
this
case
would
not
allow
a
conviction.
but
assuming
for
a
moment,
that
was
the
statute
we
had,
i'm
sorry.
assuming
that
we
did
not
have
the
statute
but
we
have
the
statute
that
we
have,
we
don't
reach
the
question
because
that's
far
beyond
the
federal
statute.
i
might
point
out
that
the
honorable
ramsey
clark
and
i
realized
it
is
not
binding
in
this
court
at
any
matter
whatsoever,
but
he
still
made
a
very
have
observation
to
congress
when
they
were
adapting
their
statute
that
the
words
as
used
in
the
new
york
statute
deter
and
in
the
proposed
statute
before
the
congress
will
very
much
like
the
new
york
statute.
and
freedom
of
speech
--
mr.
david
t.
goldstick
i
do
not.
mr.
david
t.
goldstick
i'm
sorry
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
david
t.
goldstick
that
is
the
nub,
isn't
it?
mr.
david
t.
goldstick
that
is
the
nub
of
the
problem
isn't
it,
because
that
is
exactly
what
we
are
saying.
we
are
saying
also
that
even
under
the
circumstances,
these
circumstances
mr.
justice
fortas
pointed
out,
that
the
act
could
then
be
coupled
with
other
acts
that
in
and
up
itself
now
brings
it
out
of
the
simple
due
process
problems
of
a
criminal
statute
and
close
it
with
first
amendment
problems.
and
i
might
point
out
--
mr.
david
t.
goldstick
not
necessarily.
not
necessarily
because
on
its
face,
there's
no
restriction
of
speech,
but
there
may
be
as
for
example
as
apply,
the
person
may
be
doing
the
burning
and
shouting
that
united
states
is
not
belong
in
that--
mr.
david
t.
goldstick
no
words?
well,
there
is
no
--
mr.
david
t.
goldstick
no,
i
don't
see
where
the
communication
is.
there
has
to
be
a
communication
in
order
for
them
to
--
mr.
david
t.
goldstick
not
necessarily,
if
i
filled
myself
with
a
couple
of
statute,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
david
t.
goldstick
could
it
be.
the
answer
to
that
would
be
if
--
mr.
david
t.
goldstick
if
street
had
not
said
a
word
--
not
necessarily.
i'm
trying
to
get
to
the
--
to
the
not
necessary
part.
if
the
burning
of
the
act,
at
the
burning
of
the
flag
took
on
a
secondary
meaning,
for
example
if
this
was
a
protest
where
people
realized
that
the
burning
was
for
a
purpose
of
protest.
there
was
a
communication,
before
kleenex
was
on
the
market
for
example
for
number
of
years,
the
word
kleenex
has
no
secondary
meaning
but
it
got
a
meaning
because
people
got
using
it.
the
same
thing
with
draft
card
burning,
today
when
a
fellow
burns
a
draft
card
in
public,
we
very
well
know
what
he
was
doing,
it
was
usually
that
he
was
communicating
a
protest
against
the
vietnam
war.
flag
burning
hasn't
got
that
secondary
meaning
but
i
submit
it
may
very
well
get
to
that
point.
but
that
isn't
our
problem
at
this
time,
i'm
willing
to
concede
right
now
that
simply
that
--
simple
act
of
burning
the
flag
in
new
york,
but
not
under
the
statute,
would
be
--could
be
illegal
because
the
statute
goes
far
beyond
that
problem.
mr.
david
t.
goldstick
i
agree
with
mr.
chief
--mr.
justice
--
mr.
david
t.
goldstick
i
understand.
i
might
point
out--
mr.
david
t.
goldstick
thank
you.
i
might
--
mr.
david
t.
goldstick
mr.
justice
black,
i
hope
by
the
time
i
finish
today,
and
after
this
court
has
seriously
considered
the
merits
of
this
case
that
that
statement
would
not
be
the
law
of
this
land.
mr.
david
t.
goldstick
i'm
not
saying
that
because
you
don't
even
have
to
reach
that
question
because
we
have
a
statute
on
its
face
that
it
breaches
freedom
of
speech
that
you
don't
even
have
to
reach
that
problem.
what
i
am
saying
however
--
mr.
david
t.
goldstick
the
reason
mr.
justice
black,
i
say
we
don't
have
to
reach
it
is
because,
street
was
convicted
under
a
statute
that
is
unconstitutional
on
it's
face
as
being
a
obvious
restriction
on
verbal
speech,
it
says
you
can't
use
words
and
that
he
has
a
right
i
believe,
to
attack
that
statute
and
thereby
attack
his
conviction
even
though
new
york
may
well
have
the
right
to
outlaw
exactly
what
he
did.
and
i
think
thornhill
against
alabama
is
exactly
that
type
of
a
situation.
but
to
get
back
to
your
question
your
honor,
i
would
like
to
feel
that
the
issue
here
on
an
act
as
well
as
words
is
whether
a
communication
was
made
and
whether
the
communication
was
understood,
because
isn't
that
truly
the
problem
of
a
freedom
of
speech
case.
the
communication
of
an
idea
to
the
public
and
the
receipt
of
that
communication
by
the
public,
and
this
is
the
nub
of
the
issue
that
mr.
justice
black
has
referred
to,
and
this
is
the
nub
of
the
other
issue
of
this
case
which
i
freely
admit
does
not
have
to
be
reached.
but
if
reached;
should
be
decided
on
drawing
criteria
for
us
to
know
when
act
and
speech
is
speech
and
when
act
and
speech
is
not
speech,
and
therefore
not
entitle
the
first
amendment
protection.
if
i
might
digress
just
for
a
moment
--
mr.
david
t.
goldstick
yes.
mr.
david
t.
goldstick
yes
it
is.
mr.
david
t.
goldstick
he
dealt
with
it
only
on
a
footnote.
i'll
show
you--
mr.
david
t.
goldstick
we
did.
and
it
was
considered
your
honor,
at
page
4a
of
the
decision,
footnote
1.
we
raise
the
entire
argument
of
overbreadth
in
vagueness
in
the
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
david
t.
goldstick
and
well,
at
the
trial
court,
i
might
point
out
that
if
you
have
an
examination
of
the
record.
as
i
was
making
my
motions,
i
was
politely
asked
really
to
sit
down.
we
never
really
got
the
finishing
making
our
emotions,
and
not
only
was
at
the
issue
to
discuss
that
the
trial
court,
but
it
was
also
discussed
at
the
court
of
appeals
and
dealt
within
that
motion.
but
i
might
point
out
mr.
justice
white,
that
the
overbreadth
argument
is
a
first
amendment
argument,
it's
not
a
fourteenth
amendment
argument.
we
raise
first
amendment
question.
mr.
david
t.
goldstick
i
would
--
it
would
be
my
understandings
provided
any
issue
on
first
amendment
infirmities
raised
and
in
any
manner
what
so
whether,
whether
be
overbreadth
or
void
on
its
face
or
improper
application
of
the
statute
would
still
be
a
first
amendment
objection
and
properly
raised
--
mr.
david
t.
goldstick
but
i
--
of
course
if
you
read
it
as
if
i
did
not
raise
it
but
it
was
raised
that
you
see
raised
in
my
motion
at
the
trial
court
i
raised
first
amendment
objections
i
said
the
statute
is
void
for
first
amendment
problems
and
judge
fuld
pass
on
first
amendment
problems
and
there
whole
question
of
overbreadth
is
first
amendment
not
a
vagueness
or
due
process
problem.
mr.
david
t.
goldstick
i
have
no
argument
with
mr.
justice
white
if
that
is
your
decision
certainly
under
the
rules
of
this
court
--
mr.
david
t.
goldstick
i
would
believe
so
that
it
does.
mr.
david
t.
goldstick
no,
not
to
and
this
case?
if
i
have
raised
first
amendment
–
as
far
as
the
overbreadth
i
would
say,
yes.
but
as
far
as
the
applications
--
mr.
david
t.
goldstick
yes,
i
would.
mr.
david
t.
goldstick
not
so
because
the
court
of
appeals
are
considered
the
vagueness
question
which
was
not
raised
at
the
criminal
court
level.
the
vagueness
question
though
dispose
of
in
a
footnote
was
still
considered.
we
have
pointed
out
that
the
statute
was
vague
because
he
never
said
what
flag
they
were
talking
about.
that
was
disposed
of
in
a
footnote
and
that
was
the
total
consideration
given
to
the
vagueness
argument
by
judge
fuld.
mr.
david
t.
goldstick
in
due
deference
to
your
honors
observation,
i
again
refer
back
to
page
8a
of
the
opinion
as
to
the
construction
and
the
statute
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
language
by
discouraging
contemptuous
and
insulting
treatment
of
the
flag
in
public
is
a
construction
given
to
this
statute
by
judge
fuld
and
i
might--
mr.
david
t.
goldstick
i
can't
answer
that
question.
mr.
david
t.
goldstick
of
course,
it
mean
something
but
i
think
there's
another
–
there's
another
answer
to
your
question
your
honor
and
that
is
simply
that
the
construction
of
the
court
of
appeals
was
not
available
to
the
criminal
court
judge
when
he
tried
the
case.
mr.
david
t.
goldstick
page
13
a
mr.
david
t.
goldstick
yes,
your
honor.
that
is
it.
mr.
david
t.
goldstick
simply
the
reference
the
first
amendment
that
day
--
we
were
engage
in
the
first
amendment
activities.
mr.
david
t.
goldstick
absolutely,
your
honor
and
i
might
say
we
have
had
it
in
a
--
mr.
david
t.
goldstick
i
might
add
your
honor
that
we
also
had
it
in
a
trial
memorandum
when
we
made
the
motion
and
the
trial
memorandum
had
a
full
point
on
overbreadth.
i
don't
have
that
is
in
part
of
the
record
but
it
was
certainly
and
i
turn
–
i
direct
you
to
page
2
when
i
was
very
abruptly
requested
by
the
judge,
“sorry
mr.
goldstick
no
more
emotions,
lets
sit
down.”
the
issue
was
briefed
and
argued
all
the
way
up
and
i'm
just
saying
that
it
wasn't
fully
treated
by
judge
fuld,
and
just
one
other
point
that
i
would
like
to
make,
if
i
may,
and
that
deals
with
the
problem
of
this
statute
as
applied.
you'll
notice
in
the
record
that
sidney
street
was
convicted
--
was
charge
with
both
disorderly
conduct
and
with
breach
of
the
peace.
he
was
acquitted
of
disorderly
conduct
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
not
a
scintilla
of
proof
that
there
was
a
breach
of
the
peace
occurred
where
that
a
breach
of
the
peace
was
likely
to
occur.
now,
judge
fuld
bases
his
decision
on
the
right
of
new
york
under
its
police
power
to
restrict
acts
that
would
cause
a
breach
of
the
peace
or
likely
to
cause
a
breach
of
the
peace.
but
its
our
contention
your
honors
that
there
was
no
breach
of
the
peace,
no
evidence
of
a
likely
breach
of
the
peace,
and
the
only
way
therefore
street
could
have
been
convicted
under
this
theory
that
this
is
a
statute
of
prevent
the
breach
of
the
peace
would
have
to
be
that
there
is
something
inherently
dangerous
in
this
type
of
conduct.
and
so
that
therefore
the
state
of
new
york
has
a
right
to
prevent
conduct
that
is
inherently
dangerous.
mr.
david
t.
goldstick
mr.
justice
fortas,
this
court
i
recommend
to
your
reading
the
record
and
of
course
under
your
power
you
have
the
right
to
review
the
record
with
regards
to
the
finding
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
i
simply
submit
that
judge
fuld's
observations
are
not
supported
by
those--
mr.
david
t.
goldstick
well,
his
analysis
if
i
understand
it,
would
be
on
base
upon
the
power
of
the
state
to
make
some
regulations
even
though
they
may
fly
in
the
face
of
first
amendment
problems
and
the
issue
then
becomes
where
is
the
line
drawn
between
what
the
state
can
do
with
regards
to
first
amendment
problems.
and
i
respectfully
submit
that
if
you
do
an
analogy
of
a
statute
as
a
breach
–
if
it
comes
under
the
breach
of
a
power
of
the
state
to
prevent
public
disorder,
then
the
analogy
must
file
--
follow
what
is
that
power
when
we
come
across
a
breach
–
when
come
across
a
freedom
of
a
speech
problem
and
the
power
has
historically
been.
and
as
far
as
my
reading
of
the
cases
in
this
court
has
always
been
has
there
been
a
breach
of
a
peace
or
will
a
breach
of
the
peace
likely
occur
and
you
will
examine
the
record
to
see
if
it's
there.
that
to
me
--
mr.
david
t.
goldstick
i
can't
answer
that
question,
i
don't
know.
whether
we
should
read
the
entire--
mr.
david
t.
goldstick
oh,
i
see
what
the
point
of
your
honor
and
i
seem
to
feel
it
that
that
maybe
so
but
does
not
mean
that
the
point
was
not
properly
raised
or
perhaps
we
--
perhaps
just
discarded.
i
can't
answer
what
went
down
the
minds
of
the
judges
in
the
court
of
appeals,
i
cannot
answer
that.
thank
you.
mr.
david
t.
goldstick
yes.
mr.
david
t.
goldstick
it
was
brief
your
honor
in
the
--
in
our
appeal
to
this
court.
mr.
david
t.
goldstick
yes.
mr.
david
t.
goldstick
yes,
and
it
really
is
not
moot
from
mr.
street
point
of
view
because
if
this
conviction
is
affirmed,
we
have
a
hearing
waiting
for
us
back
before
the
new
york
city
transit
authority
on
this
man's
job.
so,
for
mr.
street's
point
of
view
this
is
far
from
a
moot
issue.
mr.
david
t.
goldstick
yes.
mr.
david
t.
goldstick
that
is
quite
true
but
i
have
a
letter
in
my
file
from
the
transit
authority
they're
holding
up
the
hearing
waiting
the
determination
of
this
court.
thank
you
very
much
your
honor.
mr.
david
t.
goldstick
just
one
point
mr.
chief
justice.
