justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
though
you
would
say
that
power
ends
as
just
the
moment
that
the
conduct
is
communicative.
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
and
it
ends
as
soon
as
there
is
a
claim
that
is
communicative?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
is.
it
doesn't
say
word
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
that
we
have
instead
of
word
here
that
same
word
with
--
it
is
like
you
--
justice
byron
r.
white
may
i
just
ask
you
about
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
noticed
that
judge
fuld's
opinion
doesn't
deal
with
your
argument
which
i
gather
as
an
argument
of
overbreadth
that
because
the
statute
deals
both
with
conduct
and
words
this
appellant
has
standing
to
attack
constitutionally
of
the
statute
on
its
face.
that's
your
argument
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
why
is
it
that
judge
fuld's
opinion
didn't
deal
with
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
which
footnote?
i
raise
this
because
i
gather
the
states
going
to
content
does
at
least
in
its
brief
that
was
not
considered
because
you
did
not
raise
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
how
bout
the
trial
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
so?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
would
you
say
if
we
have
--
we
taught
we
had
to
read
judge
fuld's
opinion
as
not
twiddling
of
a
question
because
as
a
matter
of
state
law
your
failure
to
raise
a
trial
included
any
right
to
have
it
consider
in
the
appellate
courts.
if
we
have
to
read
it
that
way,
then
where
do
you
stand?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
the
court
disagree
with
you
on
that
and
since
said
that
you
have
to
raise
a
little
more
precisely
--
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
first
amendment
raises
all
issues
under
the
first
amendment?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
have
to
–
is
that
–
do
you
have
to
rely
on
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
as
far
as
overbreadth
is
you
have
to
rely
on
that
position?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
you
think
them
as
this
is
the
rule
of
new
york
that
–
is
it
the
general
rule
at
to
that
the
appellate
court
doesn't
consider
things
is
not
–
that
their
not
believe
in
that
one?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
except
there's
something
else
that
the
fact
is
bothered
me
mr.
goldstick
and
that
reason
i
ask
you
about
your
answer
to
justice
fortas
question.
judge
fuld
in
footnote
1,
appearing
on
4a
of
the
appendix
of
this
case,
it
seems
to
say
before
the
highest
court
in
new
york
that
this
statute
simply
prohibits
public
mutilation
of
the
flag
and
that's
why
the
way
he
construes
the
statute.
and
of
course,
we
have
to
take
that
construction
as
though
the
statute
were
written
that
way
under
we've
excepted
conventional
doctrines
in
this
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
i
suppose
you
could
--
the
whole
of
your
function
that
page
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
this
is
it,
before
we
plead
to
this
case
i'd
like
to
make
a
motion
of
dismiss,
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
is
it
in
that
motion
that
you
say,
raises
the
overbreadth
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
under
the
first
amendment
--
am
i
correct
so
this
is
the
only
reference
is
in
it
the
first
amendment?
under
the
first
amendment
of
the
constitution
united
states
and
of
the
new
york
state
constitution
famous
speech,
“they
provide
for
protest
in
many
forms
whether
it
be
by
burning
a
flag,
demonstration
or
picketing.
this
is
a
form
of
demonstration
of
protest,
is
that
what
raises
your
overbreadth?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
must
say
in
the
face
of
it
mr.
goldstick
that
reached
to
me
something
like
an
argument
base
on
symbolic
speech.
there
is
conduct
but
the
conduct
as
protection
of
the
first
amendment
as
symbolic
speech.
justice
byron
r.
white
are
we
to
lead
everything
that
chief
judge
fuld
said
against
the
background
of
its
opening
sentence
in
the
opinion?
we
are
called
upon
to
decide
whether
the
deliberate
act
of
burning
an
american
flag
in
public
as
a
protest
maybe
punished
as
a
crime.
justice
byron
r.
white
we
often
it
to
so
our
opinion
with
a
statement
of
the
question
hoping
the
opinion
will
then
be
read
as
bearing
on
as
answering
the
question
that
so
with
which
the
opinion
open.
and
that
certainly
reads
as
so
he
regarded
the
case,
doesn't
it
as
presenting
simply
a
question
of
so-called
symbolic
speech?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
the
intent?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
what
is
the
significance
of
the
act
if
you
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
is
intact
with
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
but
while
you're
considering
that
--
did
you
suggest
that
or
do
you
agree
that
the
only
way
that
you
would
know
it
is
a
protest
in
the
words
that
were
used.
justice
byron
r.
white
okay.
justice
byron

i
take
