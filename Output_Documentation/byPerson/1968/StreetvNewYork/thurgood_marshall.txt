mr.
brodbar,
how
many
people
are
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
it
in
the
record?
justice
thurgood
marshall
suppose
it
burned
it
at
night
and
nobody
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
many
people?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
taught
the
definition
of
riot
was
three
or
more.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
we
really
don't
know.
we
really
don't
know
what
the
statute
means
by
public
late,
do
we?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
could
see
a
little
difference
myself
between
burning
a
flag
on
my
front
lawn
and
burning
it
in
yankee
stadium,
could
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
couldn't?
justice
thurgood
marshall
suppose
they're
all
friends?
justice
thurgood
marshall
suppose
they
all
agree
with
me.
justice
thurgood
marshall
suppose
they
all
agree
with
me,
that
the
flag
should
be
burned?
justice
thurgood
marshall
where
is
that
in
the
statute?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
don't
really
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
the
language
is
in
the
charge
specifically.
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
was
it
put
in
the
charge?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
they
only
put
part
in
it
and
put
it
all
in?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
have
it
in
quotes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
looks
like
it
speech?
justice
thurgood
marshall
who
prepared
the
complaint?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
policeman
said
that
this
was
in
violation
of
1425,
subsection16
(d),
he
put
that
language
in
there,
the
policeman?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
that's
why
it's
strange
to
me.
the
only
thing
i'm
talking
about,
you
say,
the
only
reason
these
words
in
quote
in
this
charge
which
is
a
legal
charge
on
behalf
of
the
state
of
new
york
was
because
the
policeman
insisted
that
it
be
in
there.
i
want
to
find
out
whether
it
was
the
policeman,
or
the
prosecutor,
or
the
lawyer,
or
the
judge,
or
the
magistrate,
or
who?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
who?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
don't
know?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
when
did
the
prosecutor
get
involved?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
he
had
taken
that
language
out?
justice
thurgood
marshall
could
he
have
taken
the
language
out
of
that
charge?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
he
didn't?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
the
state
of
new
york
insisted
that
this
charge
include
both
the
act
and
the
language
that
was
the
decision
of
the
state
of
new
york,
am
i
right?
