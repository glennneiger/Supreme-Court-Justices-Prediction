mr.
harry
brodbar
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
harry
brodbar
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
it
is
the
states'
contention
that
the
appellant
was
convicted
only
for
the
act
of
burning,
that
any
reference
to
language
is
mere
suffrage.
the
officers
set
forth
some
language
and
his
information
his
complaint
but
that
language
is
language
that's
usually
set
forth
by
a
police
officer
to
indicate
intent
on
the
part
of
the
participant
in
the
crime.
it
is
our
feeling
also
the
language
used,
“if
they
did
this
to
meredith,
we
don't
need
an
american
flag.”
that
language
is
not
contentious.
certainly,
the
officer
wouldn't
have
arrested
him
for
merely
making
that
statement.
the
record
is
clear
that
the
officer
came
to
the
scene
because
he
saw
a
flag
burned.
he
then
went
over
to
some
of
the
people
a
crowd
and
asked
them,
“who
burned
the
flag?”
he
then
went
to
the
appellant
and
asked
the
appellant
whether
he
burned
the
flag?
and
the
appellant
told
him,
”if
they
did
this
to
meredith,
we
don't
need
an
american
flag.”
the
officer
then
went
back
to
the
scene,
the
opposite
corner,
attempted
to
stamp
of
the
fire,
pick
up
the
flag,
took
it
to
police
headquarters
and
marked
it
as
part
of
an
invoice.
by
inadvertence,
the
flag
was
never
marked
an
evidence,
although,
i
have
it
here
with
me.
it
is
obvious
then
that
the
arrest
was
only
for
the
burning
of
the
american
flag.
there
was
another
statement
made
by
the
appellant
which
the
office
had
overheard,
“we
don't
need
no
damn
flag.”
it
is
also
significant
that
the
officer
did
not
make
that
part
of
his
complaint
that
he
ignored
that
statement
against
threatening
the
states
position
at
the
arrest
for
–
was
for
the
act.
by
--
in
passing,
i
might
say
that
even
the
word
--
that
the
words
“damn
flag”
might
would
be
consider
contemptuous
under
the
case
of
chaplinsky
against
new
hampshire,
where
the
statement
damn
fuscous
and
then
racketeer
were
held
to
be
words
which
might
insight
to
retaliation
and
the
court
they
unanimously
affirmed
the
conviction.
the
appellant
cannot
find
any
solace
in
any
argument
that
the
appellant
was
convicted
of
under
a
general
of
verdict
that
was
perhaps
for
the
words,
for
the
act
or
for
both.
it
is
obvious
that
he
was
arrested,
tried,
and
convicted
only
for
the
act
of
burning
the
american
flag,
should
judge
fuld
precipices
the
appeal
of
a
unanimous
court
with
the
following,
“we
are
called
upon
to
determine
whether
the
deliberate
act
of
burning
an
american
flag
in
public
as
a
protest
maybe
punish
as
a
crime."
mr.
harry
brodbar
30
to
40
people,
your
honor.
mr.
harry
brodbar
yes.
yes,
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
harry
brodbar
well,
it
would
have
to
be
the
word
public
connotes
say
presence
of
people
for
that
mean
--
mr.
harry
brodbar
enough
people
to
start
a
riot.
a
reasonable
amount
of
people
perhaps,
five
people
will
be
enough.
mr.
harry
brodbar
well,
i
would
say
that
three
or
more
people
would
have
to
be
present.
i
would
also
say
that
30
to
40
people
is
significant
--
mr.
harry
brodbar
well,
the
statute
does
not
defy
a
public.
we
must
go
back
to
the
case
law
and
that
the
world
public
signifies
the
presence
of
a
reasonable
number
of
persons
which
might
give
raise
to
the
danger
that
the
statute
intends
to
prohibit.
mr.
harry
brodbar
no,
i
cannot.
mr.
harry
brodbar
except
that
the
chances
for
a
disturbance
might
be
greater
in
yankee
stadium
but
the
disturbance
is
there
nevertheless
if
near
your
lawn
there
are
the
persons
present.
mr.
harry
brodbar
friends
may
to
retaliate
in
the
burning
of
american
flag.
mr.
harry
brodbar
pardon
your
honor?
mr.
harry
brodbar
well,
there
is
nothing
need
than
the
flag
must
be
protected
from
people
who
agreed
to
burn
a
flag
contemptuous.
mr.
harry
brodbar
the
statute
does
not
say
that
but
halter
against
nebraska,
a
case
that
was
before
this
court
1906,
although,
there
the
flag
was
used
in
advertising
scheme.
mr.
harry
brodbar
first
mr.
justice
harlan,
stated
at
that
time.
mr.
harry
brodbar
pardon
your
honor?
mr.
harry
brodbar
there
is
nothing
on
the
statute
with
regards
to
the
word
public.
we
must
accept
the
dictionary
meaning
of
the
word
public
that
in
connotes
say
reasonable,
sizable
amount
of
persons
who
are
present
of
a
scene,
and
who
might
bring
disturbance
because
of
an
act
committed
by
a
person.
i
think
ever
two
persons
present
at
a
scene
might
justify
the
conviction
of
mr.
street.
if
this
court
should
have
wise
judgment
determine
that
the
language
defy
by
words
is
unconstitutional
what
i
mean
to
say
is
this,
in
chaplinsky
against
new
hampshire
the
court
did
not
go
into
a
second
portion
of
the
statute.
the
first
portion
dealt
with
words
and
names,
the
second
portion
dealt
with
sounds
and
noises.
the
court
there
did
not
go
onto
the
second
portion
and
convicted
chaplinsky
for
the
use
of
names,
epithets
heard
upon
a
--
persons
in
the
area.
it
is
our
view
that
this
court
although
the
appellant
was
sentenced
for
the
act
of
desecration,
it
is
our
view
and
our
hope
that
the
court
also
determines
the
validity
of
the
expression
words
in
the
statute
for
if
it
does
not
then
any
postscription
of
physical
acts
will
be
dissipated
because
the
path
will
be
left
open
for
desecration
by
words.
it
is
significant
also
that
chief
judge
fuld
discusses
in
his
opinion
many
case
dealing
with
symbolic
expression
and
it
does
not
go
into
any
cases
were
pure
language
was
used.
it
is
also
the
states
contention
that
the
court
did
not
render
any
consistent
verdict
by
dismissing
the
more
general
charge
of
disorderly
conduct
and
holding
him
under
the
statute
which
specifically
prohibited
the
act.
mr.
street
could
not
be
sentenced
under
two
charges,
section
1938
of
the
code
of
penal
law
of
the
state
of
new
york,
prohibits
that.
the
entire
terror
of
the
12
revolves
about
the
flag
burning
itself,
at
the
time
of
the
cross
examination
of
the
appellant
at
the
time
of
the
cross
examination
of
the
police
officer
there
was
nothing
discussed
about
pure
language,
only
the
act
was
discusses.
it
is
also
significant
that
this
case,
the
trial
of
this
case
took
place
six
weeks
after
miranda
against
arizona
and
experienced
counsel
did
not
set
up
the
miranda
rules
as
a
bar
language
was
have
been
elicited
from
the
officer
from
the
appellant
at
the
time
of
his
arrest.
mr.
harry
brodbar
yes,
it
isn't
a
charge.
mr.
harry
brodbar
because
it
is
customary
for
officers
to
place
in
a
compliant
any
language
which
inculpates
an
appellant.
mr.
harry
brodbar
well,
the
part
was
enough
to
indicate
that
the
appellant
intended
to
dishonor
the
flag
of
our
nation.
mr.
harry
brodbar
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
harry
brodbar
but
if
you'll
notice
the
second
part
--
the
general
paragraph
preceding
a
language
only
discuss
the
act
of
burning
the
american
flag.
the
language
of
the
--
mr.
harry
brodbar
yes.
mr.
harry
brodbar
i
would
say
that
--
mr.
harry
brodbar
no,
it
would
not
be
constitutional.
it
would
be
over
broad
because
there
is
a
federal
statute
which
permits
the
dignified
burning
of
the
flag
--
mr.
harry
brodbar
and
there
was
no
way
of
knowing
under
the
words
of
your
statue
mr.
justice
fortas
whether
the
man
was
doing
it
in
dignified
fashion
or
with
contempt.
therefore,
the
statute
over
broad
would
result
in
obituary
standards
and
prior
restraining.
mr.
harry
brodbar
no
words
at
all
unnecessary.
it's
the
atmosphere
of
the
contempt.
his
anger,
the
lack
over
this
same
smile.
mr.
harry
brodbar
well,
your
honor.
one
who
honors
a
flag
by
burning
it
to
the
proper
manner
will
certainly
have
an
attitude
--
mr.
harry
brodbar
under
your
statute,
your
honor.
i
would
say
to
the
statute
would
be
barred
because
it
should
be
some
language
in
the
statute
which
will
indicate
contempt.
mr.
harry
brodbar
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
would
say
that
if
they
were
no
federal
statute
permitting
respectful
burning
of
the
flag
then
that
statute
would
be
alright.
mr.
harry
brodbar
yes,
it
may
if
there
is
federal
statute
which
permits
respectful
burning.
but
if
there
is
a
statute
that
permits
it,
then
the
state
cannot
with
that
legal
language
create
a
statute
so
over
broad
that
anyone
burning
a
flag,
who
might
be
doing
get
with
respect
could
be
arrested
and
convicted
for
it.
the
state
is
mine
form
of
the
fact
and
i'd
made
not
enact
any
law
which
will
unconstitutionally
have
abridge
the
freedom
of
speech
and
expression.
yet,
not
with
standing
the
sacrosanct
nature
of
first
amendment
principles,
a
state
may
in
the
interest
of
peace
and
tranquility
within
its
borders
has
any
statute
even
though,
it
may
have
abridge
freedom
of
speech.
it
will
be
for
this
honorable
court
to
determine
whether
the
united
states
flag,
the
object
of
national
parte,
and
patriotic
adoration
can
be
a
subject
of
desecration
merely
because
one
wants
to
use
it
in
a
symbolic
way
to
dramatize
dissatisfaction
with
the
conditions
existing
in
our
country.
the
need
for
such
a
statute
was
recognized
by
the
first
amendment.
mr.
harry
brodbar
well,
according
to
the
complaint
you
are
right
mr.
justice
fortas
but
chief
judge
fuld
did
not
go
into
that.
mr.
harry
brodbar
the
statute
influenced
either
words
or
act.
mr.
harry
brodbar
or
act.
but
the
--
mr.
harry
brodbar
mr.
justice
fortas,
it
is
the
states'
contention
of
the
statute
is
divisible
that
can't
be
separated,
that
the
appellant
was
convicted
only
for
the
act
of
desecration.
not
with
standing
the
fact
the
officer
and
his
complaint
set
forth
the
words.
we
reiterated
that
the
words
was
set
forth
only
to
indicate
the
intent,
and
if
the
words
were
mere
surpassage
that
they
were
not
necessary.
mr.
harry
brodbar
the
intent
to
--
has
contempt
upon
the
flag
of
our
nation
that
was
the
intent.
mr.
harry
brodbar
no,
the
act
--
the
significance
of
the
act
became
significant
by
the
act
itself
by
the
--
his
mannerisms
by
waving
his
hands
in
another
corner
living
the
flag
in
another
place.
mr.
harry
brodbar
it
became
clear.
mr.
harry
brodbar
no,
it
may
become
more
clear.
let
us
say
not
clear.
it
became
more
clearer
because
how
he
said
nothing
is
very
demeanor,
burning
a
flag,
running
to
another
corner,
waving
his
arms
in
an
agitated
condition.
those
words
--
mr.
harry
brodbar
i
can
agree
with
that
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
harry
brodbar
it
is
our
opinion
that
the
acts
--
that
the
postscription
of
the
statute
is
directed
at
physical
acts
of
mutilation,
defacing,
defiling,
trampling
upon,
and
that
also
the
statute
post
scribes
the
use
of
language
which
also
defies
or
past
contempt
upon
the
flag.
that
the
words
past
contempt
is
the
--
are
the
keywords
which
direct
the
all
of
the
other
language
that
the
language
indicates
dishonor
something
purposeful.
a
lively
sense
of
shaming
that's
either
one
or
the
other
or
both
in
this
particular
case,
there
was
only
one
thing
that
the
appellant
had
done
burn
the
flag,
his
statement
was
not
contemptuous.
it
was
a
statement
if
we
--
if
this
could
happen
to
meredith
we
don't
need
the
american
flag.
there
was
nothing
contemptuous
about
that
statement
and
that
statement
in
the
complaint,
although,
not
contemptuous
is
set
forth
by
the
police
officer
or
the
indicated
it
intent.
it
was
not
necessary
to
have
it
in
the
complaint
itself
because
the
appellant's
act
was
one
of
contempt,
not
only
did
he
set
fire
to
the
flag
according
to
my
adversary
he
came
down
to
the
street
and
put
a
paper
down
on
the
ground.
what
was
the
purpose
of
the
paper,
the
officer
testified
that
there
weren't
no,
was
no
paper.
what
could
with
the
paper
do
if
the
appellant
is
burning
a
flag
and
drops
a
burning
flag
on
the
paper?
it
is
more
likely
that
the
paper
was
there
to
induce
great
of
burning,
that
was
the
purpose
of
the
paper
and
that
the
flag
was
folded.
the
flag
had
been
folded
in
his
drawer,
in
his
chest
of
drawers.
he
was
a
veteran.
the
testimony
indicates
that
he
put
the
flag
on
in
every
holiday.
the
flag
was
not
folded
because
he
showed
respect.
he
came
down
into
the
street,
laid
the
flag
down,
burn
it,
run
to
another
corner,
is
that
the
conduct
of
a
person
who
shows
respect?
when
the
american
legion
has
its
ceremony
once
a
year
to
burn
american
flags,
they
don't
run
to
other
corners
while
they're
burning
the
flags
on
one
corner.
they
stay
with
the
flag
that
is
considered
respect.
these
words
were
not
even
necessary
of
the
complaint.
they
are
mere
surpassage.
mr.
harry
brodbar
the
officer
your
honor,
generally,
the
officer
with
the
assistance
of
a
clerk
in
the
court.
mr.
harry
brodbar
no,
i
can
tell
that
from
a
little
experience
i've
had
in
the
criminal
courts
watching
the
clerks
do
their
work.
the
jury
--
the
clerk
will
pick
up
the
penal
law
of
the
state
new
york
find
the
caption
and
make
an
entry,
incidentally,
mr.
justice
marshall.
this
is
about
the
first
case
from
the
history
of
our
country
where
this
statute
was
even
used
when
patrolman
copeland
made
his
arrest,
he
did
not
know
that
he
made
the
first
arrest
in
the
history
to
state
of
new
york
for
public
burning
of
the
flag.
certainly,
the
court
was
not
what
aware
of
that,
he
would
not
experience
the
statute
of
the
language.
mr.
harry
brodbar
it
would
not
be
the
judge,
your
honor
because
the
judge
would
not
would
--
mr.
harry
brodbar
it
would
be
the
clerk
and
the
officer.
mr.
harry
brodbar
no.
but
i
know
from
custom
in
new
york
court
that
is
the
clerk
and
the
officer
who
do
it.
then
the
case
comes
before
the
judge.
mr.
harry
brodbar
when
the
case
which
its
turn
in
the
calendar,
the
assistant
district
attorney
came
into
the
case
and
tried
the
case
as
we
say
--
mr.
harry
brodbar
did
he
do
what,
your
honor?
mr.
harry
brodbar
he
could
have
but
he
did
not
--
mr.
harry
brodbar
he
did
not
your
honor.
mr.
harry
brodbar
well,
that's
the
effect
of
that
but
your
honor,
mr.
justice
marshall,
in
every
case
when
an
office
or
even
a
book
making
case,
or
on
a
policy
case
an
officer
would
set
forth
exculpatory
statements.
the
mere
fact
that
exculpatory
statements
are
set
forth
is
that
mean
that
is
part
of
a
statute.
the
officer
feels
that
it's
better
for
this
case
to
set
forth
language.
it
explains
the
intent,
the
man's
rare
--
mr.
harry
brodbar
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
harry
brodbar
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
and
the
words
deliberate
are
not
only
brought
out
by
the
conduct
but
also
by
the
words
set
forth
in
the
complaint.
and
i
reiterate
that
the
words
were
not
necessary,
that
the
facts
indicate
contemptuous
treatment
of
the
flag
by
mr.
sidney
street,
that
there
was
no
in
advertence
or
accidental
occurrence.
this
was
planned
that
the
people
who's
partly
around
him
did
not
collect
your
honor
because
he
did
an
in
adverted
act.
mr.
harry
brodbar
yes,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
harry
brodbar
no,
from
his
conduct.
mr.
harry
brodbar
from
his
agitated
condition,
from
his
anger.
one
does
not
simply
burn
a
flag
with
contend
gently.
there's
an
atmosphere,
it
is
an
emotional
about
an
act
like
that
when
a
mute
--
a
deaf
mute
can
show
contempt
for
the
flag
by
burning
it.
can
we
say
that
the
deaf
mute
would
not
be
a
subject
of
the
conviction?
because
he
cannot
say
what
the
language
what
he
means.
it's
what
he
does
and
how
he
does
it.
that
spells
out
the
content
for
the
flag
that
standing
in
this
courtroom.
mr.
harry
brodbar
i
did
answer.
i
did
complete.
mr.
harry
brodbar
yes
it
may
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
harry
brodbar
because
it
interferes
with
substantial
state
interest.
just
as
an
o'brien
against
united
states,
there
was
a
substantial
state
interest,
government
interest
that
a
man
had
a
draft
card.
there
are
substantial
interests
here.
mr.
harry
brodbar
the
interest
here
that
americans
love
their
flag
and
anyone
seeing
a
flag
defiled
will
--
mr.
harry
brodbar
there
was
no
--
a
draft
card
does
not
have
the
significance
of
a
flag.
the
flag
has
great
meaning.
if
a
flag
has
no
meaning
at
all
it
means
that
every
man
who
dies
for
this
flag
was
not
only
dope
by
the
flag
but
it
made
a
mockery
out
of
patriotism.
that
every
man
who
lies
on
only
cemetery
died
for
something
that
was
just
a
cloth,
a
piece
of
cloth,
which
had
no
meaning
at
all
to
them
and
now
we
say
the
flag
has
no
meaning.
it
is
like
a
--
it
is
greater
than
a
draft
card.
we
are
inculcated
with
the
spirit
of
a
flag
from
early
childhood.
a
card
is
nothing
in
reality.
it
does
not
send
me
to
retaliation
with
one
were
to
burn
his
draft
card.
i
might
be
annoyed
what
the
infantile
conduct.
mr.
harry
brodbar
yes,
i
have
your
honor.
mr.
harry
brodbar
yes,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
harry
brodbar
there
is
a
national
interest
in
the
american
flag.
mr.
harry
brodbar
the
state
interest
is
to
protect
the
national
symbol
because
the
state
is
part
of
a
nation.
if
a
nation
does
not
exist
the
state
will
not
exist.
in
halter
against
nebraska
the
first
mr.
justice
harlan
said
to
the
state
has
the
same
interest,
an
interest
to
course
respect
not
to
mandate
respect
as
a
bond
that
but
to
prevent
desecration.
mr.
harry
brodbar
yes,
mr.
justice
stewart.
but
the
case
still
has
great
significance
today.
mr.
harry
brodbar
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
harry
brodbar
well,
mr.
justice
fortas
this
is
not
--
mr.
harry
brodbar
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
harry
brodbar
mr.
justice
fortas,
we
maintain
that
the
statute
is
divisible
that
this
court
may
ignore
the
language
of
the
statute
which
speaks
of
words
because
the
opponent
was
and
i
think
before
action
--
mr.
harry
brodbar
i
intend
--
mr.
harry
brodbar
yes,
i
do.
i
defend
it
because
the
words
of
contempt
get
the
same
result
as
the
acts
of
contempt.
mr.
harry
brodbar
words
are
just
the
same
words
as
we
had,
they're
fighting
words,
they're
the
words
that
we
had
in
chaplinsky
against
new
hampshire,
when
a
man's
flag
is
degraded?
do
we
not
degrade
the
man
himself?
mr.
harry
brodbar
do
we
not
say
you
are
a
citizen
of
a
country,
are
these
not
worth
nothing?
mr.
harry
brodbar
well,
in
the
event
that
this
court
should
it
in
its
wisdom
feel
that
the
words
are
unconstitutional,
that
we'd
be
blessed
with
some
statute.
that
is
the
only
purpose
i
say
that.
mr.
harry
brodbar
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
harry
brodbar
well,
it
appears
that
way,
because
chief
judge
fuld
makes
the
statement,
“subdivision
16
of
section
1425
is
designed
to
prevent
the
outbreak
of
such
violence
by
discouraging
--
mr.
harry
brodbar
that
is
on
page
8
a
of
the
record.
“it's
designed
to
prevent
the
outbreak
of
such
violence
by
discouraging
contemptuous
and
insulting
treatment
of
the
flag
in
public.”
it
is
our
opinion
and
this
was
me
a
dictum
--
victim
in
a
case,
but
it
shows
the
inherent
feeling
of
chief
judge
fuld
speaking
for
the
entire
court
that
even
if
this
case
had
just
words
in
it
that
the
decision
might
be
the
same.
mr.
harry
brodbar
yes,
treatment
is
a
broad
term
and
includes
conduct,
it
includes
words,
it's
an
attitude,
it's
a
behavior.
mr.
harry
brodbar
yes.
mr.
harry
brodbar
yes,
mr.
chief
justice
warren.
treatment
of
the
flag,
when
one
insults
another
he
treats
it
wrongly,
does
he
not?
the
word
treatment
is
a
general
word.
but
i
say
if
the
court
was
not
concerned
at
the
particular
time
of
the
decision
with
any
words,
but
just
with
the
act.
mr.
harry
brodbar
i
would
say
this
was
an
observation
made
by
chief
judge
fuld
by
way
of
passing.
he
may
have
meant
the
act
--
mr.
harry
brodbar
no.
mr.
harry
brodbar
mr.
chief
justice
warren,
the
way
chief
judge
fuld
starts
the
case,
we
are
concerned
with
the
act
where
he
says
thereafter
is
not
part
of
this
determination
as
he'd
started
out
to
say,
where
he
said,
“we
are
called
upon
to
decide
whether
the
deliberate
act
of
burning.”
mr.
harry
brodbar
no,
i
would
say
that
the
--
mr.
harry
brodbar
well,
my
point
is
this
that
the
court
was
concerned
primarily
with
the
conduct.
the
court
was
not
considering
the
word
itself,
the
language
used
by
judge
fuld
later
on
is
dictum
that
is
the
opinion
i
have.
and
it's
also
in
my
belief
that
if
the
defendant
had
been
charged
with
words
only
and
no
act
at
all
that
the
decision
would
have
been
the
same.
but
the
court
was
concerned
only
with
the
act,
it
prefixes
its
opinion
with
the
statement.
mr.
harry
brodbar
that
is
my
respectful
opinion,
your
honor.
mr.
harry
brodbar
well,
speaking
views
about
a
flag
may
convey
a
message,
what
message
is
there
in
contempt?
mr.
harry
brodbar
no,
i'm
not
saying
that
mr.
justice
black,
i
am
saying
that
criticizing
the
flag
is
one
thing.
mr.
harry
brodbar
no
i
don't
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
harry
brodbar
i
am
concerned
with
this
court's
attitude
with
regards
to
words,
and
perhaps
that
this
court
may
decide
that
part
of
the
statute
is
dead.
i
am
here,
not
to
defend
my
flag
in
quiet
whispers,
but
to
try
to
defend
the
entire
statute
and
we've
open
the
door
to
contempt
by
use
of
words
should
this
court
find
that
the
act
is
proper,
the
act
is
actionable,
that
is
my
purpose.
mr.
harry
brodbar
no,
i
did
not
say
that.
he
can
express
his
views,
but
contempt,
profanity,
obscenity
toward
a
flag
is
not
a
message.
mr.
harry
brodbar
well,
how
else
can
one
--
mr.
harry
brodbar
how
else
can
one
show
contempt
for
the
flag
by
way
of
words,
except
by
the
use
of
epithets,
obscenity
or
profanity,
and
if
he
does
it
that
way,
what
is
the
message
he
is
conveying?
is
he
trying
to
change
government?
there
is
no
message
at
all.
he
recognizes
nothing
good
in
america
when
he
said
that,
he
has
consign
america
to
the
flames
of
obscurity,
that
is
not
the
message.
if
he
said
that
our
country
is
not
giving
me
the
proper
rights.
that
is
a
message
that
deserves
respect
under
the
first
amendment
because
at
least
the
governmental
self
improvement,
but
to
desecrate
a
flag
by
words,
leaves
no
message.
what
is
he
trying
to
say,
that
our
government
is
bad
because
of
this?
because
of
that?
he
says
nothing.
mr.
harry
brodbar
but
the
statute
does
not
cover
criticism
in
‘pure
language,
it
covers
contempt,
defiance.
mr.
harry
brodbar
criticism
is
a
--
mr.
harry
brodbar
but
when
he
talks
about
the
flag,
he's
not
talking
about.
he
is
talking
about
its
disaster,
it's
anarchy,
it's
chaos.
mr.
harry
brodbar
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
that,
when
a
parent
says
that
my
friend's
daughter
is
prettier
than
mine,
does
she
show
less
love
for
his
daughter?
mr.
harry
brodbar
no,
it
would
not.
mr.
harry
brodbar
because
that
is
not
the
contempt
that
is
meant,
our
favorable
criticism
are
not
just
point
of
view.
someone
maybe
partial
to
certain
colors,
that
is
not
the
contempt
meant.
mr.
harry
brodbar
criticism
is
not
contempt,
if
my
adversary
is
shorter
than
i
am
--
i
show
no
contempt
by
saying
that.
mere
criticism
of
a
flag
as
to
its
color
scheme
or
design
is
not
contempt.
mr.
harry
brodbar
well,
if
you
were
serious,
i
would
still
think
it
was
not
contempt.
mr.
harry
brodbar
well,
the
point
is
the
defendant
was
charged
and
convicted
of
the
act
of
burning,
so
this
talk
about
words
might
not
be
before
this
court,
but
i
hope
it
stays
before
the
court.
pardon
me
mr.
justice
black?
mr.
harry
brodbar
the
whole
case
--
mr.
harry
brodbar
the
case
deals
with
only
the
appellant's
act
of
burning
a
flag,
but
it
is
our
wish,
the
wish
of
the
state
of
new
york
that
this
court
would
determine
the
entire
statute.
and
if
it
should
hold
that
the
words
are
in
violation
of
the
first
amendment,
that
the
act
be
divisible,
that
the
statute
be
divisible
and
that
they
be
left
for
the
state
of
new
york
to
enforce
desecration
by
act.
mr.
harry
brodbar
it
does
not
but
the
logical
reading
of
it,
the
federal
statute
just
pass,
does
not
have
words,
so
it
could
stand
alone,
it
could
stand
with
just
the
act
--
mr.
harry
brodbar
there
is
no
language
in
the
statute
which
--
mr.
harry
brodbar
no,
but
there
is
a
strong
presumption
of
constitutionality
and
there
is
also
a
presumption
that
every
part
of
the
statute
fall
that
the
rest
may
remain,
unless
it
is
impossible
to
keep
the
remaining
part
of
the
statute
--
mr.
harry
brodbar
the
presumption
of
constitutionality
is
the
strongest
presumption.
however,
if
the
court
should
feel
that
part
of
the
statute
is
dead
then
there
is
also
a
presumption,
the
remaining
part
of
the
statute
can
stand,
unless
that
it's
impossible
to
consider
itself.
mr.
harry
brodbar
that
is
the
law
of
the
nation,
the
law
of
--
mr.
harry
brodbar
yes,
we
have
a
construction
statutes
in
new
york
to
give
these
meaning
to
a
statutes
that
if
part
of
a
statute
is
bad,
the
court
will
try
to
uphold
a
balance,
unless
it
is
impossible
for
it
to
stand
alone.
mr.
harry
brodbar
thank
you.
mr.
harry
brodbar
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
harry
brodbar
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
it
is
the
states'
contention
that
the
appellant
was
convicted
only
for
the
act
of
burning,
that
any
reference
to
language
is
mere
suffrage.
the
officers
set
forth
some
language
and
his
information
his
complaint
but
that
language
is
language
that's
usually
set
forth
by
a
police
officer
to
indicate
intent
on
the
part
of
the
participant
in
the
crime.
it
is
our
feeling
also
the
language
used,
“if
they
did
this
to
meredith,
we
don't
need
an
american
flag.”
that
language
is
not
contentious.
certainly,
the
officer
wouldn't
have
arrested
him
for
merely
making
that
statement.
the
record
is
clear
that
the
officer
came
to
the
scene
because
he
saw
a
flag
burned.
he
then
went
over
to
some
of
the
people
a
crowd
and
asked
them,
“who
burned
the
flag?”
he
then
went
to
the
appellant
and
asked
the
appellant
whether
he
burned
the
flag?
and
the
appellant
told
him,
”if
they
did
this
to
meredith,
we
don't
need
an
american
flag.”
the
officer
then
went
back
to
the
scene,
the
opposite
corner,
attempted
to
stamp
of
the
fire,
pick
up
the
flag,
took
it
to
police
headquarters
and
marked
it
as
part
of
an
invoice.
by
inadvertence,
the
flag
was
never
marked
an
evidence,
although,
i
have
it
here
with
me.
it
is
obvious
then
that
the
arrest
was
only
for
the
burning
of
the
american
flag.
there
was
another
statement
made
by
the
appellant
which
the
office
had
overheard,
“we
don't
need
no
damn
flag.”
it
is
also
significant
that
the
officer
did
not
make
that
part
of
his
complaint
that
he
ignored
that
statement
against
threatening
the
states
position
at
the
arrest
for
–
was
for
the
act.
by
--
in
passing,
i
might
say
that
even
the
word
--
that
the
words
“damn
flag”
might
would
be
consider
contemptuous
under
the
case
of
chaplinsky
against
new
hampshire,
where
the
statement
damn
fuscous
and
then
racketeer
were
held
to
be
words
which
might
insight
to
retaliation
and
the
court
they
unanimously
affirmed
the
conviction.
the
appellant
cannot
find
any
solace
in
any
argument
that
the
appellant
was
convicted
of
under
a
general
of
verdict
that
was
perhaps
for
the
words,
for
the
act
or
for
both.
it
is
obvious
that
he
was
arrested,
tried,
and
convicted
only
for
the
act
of
burning
the
american
flag,
should
judge
fuld
precipices
the
appeal
of
a
unanimous
court
with
the
following,
“we
are
called
upon
to
determine
whether
the
deliberate
act
of
burning
an
american
flag
in
public
as
a
protest
maybe
punish
as
a
crime."
mr.
harry
brodbar
30
to
40
people,
your
honor.
mr.
harry
brodbar
yes.
yes,
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
harry
brodbar
well,
it
would
have
to
be
the
word
public
connotes
say
presence
of
people
for
that
mean
--
mr.
harry
brodbar
enough
people
to
start
a
riot.
a
reasonable
amount
of
people
perhaps,
five
people
will
be
enough.
mr.
harry
brodbar
well,
i
would
say
that
three
or
more
people
would
have
to
be
present.
i
would
also
say
that
30
to
40
people
is
significant
--
mr.
harry
brodbar
well,
the
statute
does
not
defy
a
public.
we
must
go
back
to
the
case
law
and
that
the
world
public
signifies
the
presence
of
a
reasonable
number
of
persons
which
might
give
raise
to
the
danger
that
the
statute
intends
to
prohibit.
mr.
harry
brodbar
no,
i
cannot.
mr.
harry
brodbar
except
that
the
chances
for
a
disturbance
might
be
greater
in
yankee
stadium
but
the
disturbance
is
there
nevertheless
if
near
your
lawn
there
are
the
persons
present.
mr.
harry
brodbar
friends
may
to
retaliate
in
the
burning
of
american
flag.
mr.
harry
brodbar
pardon
your
honor?
mr.
harry
brodbar
well,
there
is
nothing
need
than
the
flag
must
be
protected
from
people
who
agreed
to
burn
a
flag
contemptuous.
mr.
harry
brodbar
the
statute
does
not
say
that
but
halter
against
nebraska,
a
case
that
was
before
this
court
1906,
although,
there
the
flag
was
used
in
advertising
scheme.
mr.
harry
brodbar
first
mr.
justice
harlan,
stated
at
that
time.
mr.
harry
brodbar
pardon
your
honor?
mr.
harry
brodbar
there
is
nothing
on
the
statute
with
regards
to
the
word
public.
we
must
accept
the
dictionary
meaning
of
the
word
public
that
in
connotes
say
reasonable,
sizable
amount
of
persons
who
are
present
of
a
scene,
and
who
might
bring
disturbance
because
of
an
act
committed
by
a
person.
i
think
ever
two
persons
present
at
a
scene
might
justify
the
conviction
of
mr.
street.
if
this
court
should
have
wise
judgment
determine
that
the
language
defy
by
words
is
unconstitutional
what
i
mean
to
say
is
this,
in
chaplinsky
against
new
hampshire
the
court
did
not
go
into
a
second
portion
of
the
statute.
the
first
portion
dealt
with
words
and
names,
the
second
portion
dealt
with
sounds
and
noises.
the
court
there
did
not
go
onto
the
second
portion
and
convicted
chaplinsky
for
the
use
of
names,
epithets
heard
upon
a
--
persons
in
the
area.
it
is
our
view
that
this
court
although
the
appellant
was
sentenced
for
the
act
of
desecration,
it
is
our
view
and
our
hope
that
the
court
also
determines
the
validity
of
the
expression
words
in
the
statute
for
if
it
does
not
then
any
postscription
of
physical
acts
will
be
dissipated
because
the
path
will
be
left
open
for
desecration
by
words.
it
is
significant
also
that
chief
judge
fuld
discusses
in
his
opinion
many
case
dealing
with
symbolic
expression
and
it
does
not
go
into
any
cases
were
pure
language
was
used.
it
is
also
the
states
contention
that
the
court
did
not
render
any
consistent
verdict
by
dismissing
the
more
general
charge
of
disorderly
conduct
and
holding
him
under
the
statute
which
specifically
prohibited
the
act.
mr.
street
could
not
be
sentenced
under
two
charges,
section
1938
of
the
code
of
penal
law
of
the
state
of
new
york,
prohibits
that.
the
entire
terror
of
the
12
revolves
about
the
flag
burning
itself,
at
the
time
of
the
cross
examination
of
the
appellant
at
the
time
of
the
cross
examination
of
the
police
officer
there
was
nothing
discussed
about
pure
language,
only
the
act
was
discusses.
it
is
also
significant
that
this
case,
the
trial
of
this
case
took
place
six
weeks
after
miranda
against
arizona
and
experienced
counsel
did
not
set
up
the
miranda
rules
as
a
bar
language
was
have
been
elicited
from
the
officer
from
the
appellant
at
the
time
of
his
arrest.
mr.
harry
brodbar
yes,
it
isn't
a
charge.
mr.
harry
brodbar
because
it
is
customary
for
officers
to
place
in
a
compliant
any
language
which
inculpates
an
appellant.
mr.
harry
brodbar
well,
the
part
was
enough
to
indicate
that
the
appellant
intended
to
dishonor
the
flag
of
our
nation.
mr.
harry
brodbar
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
harry
brodbar
but
if
you'll
notice
the
second
part
--
the
general
paragraph
preceding
a
language
only
discuss
the
act
of
burning
the
american
flag.
the
language
of
the
--
mr.
harry
brodbar
yes.
mr.
harry
brodbar
i
would
say
that
--
mr.
harry
brodbar
no,
it
would
not
be
constitutional.
it
would
be
over
broad
because
there
is
a
federal
statute
which
permits
the
dignified
burning
of
the
flag
--
mr.
harry
brodbar
and
there
was
no
way
of
knowing
under
the
words
of
your
statue
mr.
justice
fortas
whether
the
man
was
doing
it
in
dignified
fashion
or
with
contempt.
therefore,
the
statute
over
broad
would
result
in
obituary
standards
and
prior
restraining.
mr.
harry
brodbar
no
words
at
all
unnecessary.
it's
the
atmosphere
of
the
contempt.
his
anger,
the
lack
over
this
same
smile.
mr.
harry
brodbar
well,
your
honor.
one
who
honors
a
flag
by
burning
it
to
the
proper
manner
will
certainly
have
an
attitude
--
mr.
harry
brodbar
under
your
statute,
your
honor.
i
would
say
to
the
statute
would
be
barred
because
it
should
be
some
language
in
the
statute
which
will
indicate
contempt.
mr.
harry
brodbar
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
would
say
that
if
they
were
no
federal
statute
permitting
respectful
burning
of
the
flag
then
that
statute
would
be
alright.
mr.
harry
brodbar
yes,
it
may
if
there
is
federal
statute
which
permits
respectful
burning.
but
if
there
is
a
statute
that
permits
it,
then
the
state
cannot
with
that
legal
language
create
a
statute
so
over
broad
that
anyone
burning
a
flag,
who
might
be
doing
get
with
respect
could
be
arrested
and
convicted
for
it.
the
state
is
mine
form
of
the
fact
and
i'd
made
not
enact
any
law
which
will
unconstitutionally
have
abridge
the
freedom
of
speech
and
expression.
yet,
not
with
standing
the
sacrosanct
nature
of
first
amendment
principles,
a
state
may
in
the
interest
of
peace
and
tranquility
within
its
borders
has
any
statute
even
though,
it
may
have
abridge
freedom
of
speech.
it
will
be
for
this
honorable
court
to
determine
whether
the
united
states
flag,
the
object
of
national
parte,
and
patriotic
adoration
can
be
a
subject
of
desecration
merely
because
one
wants
to
use
it
in
a
symbolic
way
to
dramatize
dissatisfaction
with
the
conditions
existing
in
our
country.
the
need
for
such
a
statute
was
recognized
by
the
first
amendment.
mr.
harry
brodbar
well,
according
to
the
complaint
you
are
right
mr.
justice
fortas
but
chief
judge
fuld
did
not
go
into
that.
mr.
harry
brodbar
the
statute
influenced
either
words
or
act.
mr.
harry
brodbar
or
act.
but
the
--
mr.
harry
brodbar
mr.
justice
fortas,
it
is
the
states'
contention
of
the
statute
is
divisible
that
can't
be
separated,
that
the
appellant
was
convicted
only
for
the
act
of
desecration.
not
with
standing
the
fact
the
officer
and
his
complaint
set
forth
the
words.
we
reiterated
that
the
words
was
set
forth
only
to
indicate
the
intent,
and
if
the
words
were
mere
surpassage
that
they
were
not
necessary.
mr.
harry
brodbar
the
intent
to
--
has
contempt
upon
the
flag
of
our
nation
that
was
the
intent.
mr.
harry
brodbar
no,
the
act
--
the
significance
of
the
act
became
significant
by
the
act
itself
by
the
--
his
mannerisms
by
waving
his
hands
in
another
corner
living
the
flag
in
another
place.
mr.
harry
brodbar
it
became
clear.
mr.
harry
brodbar
no,
it
may
become
more
clear.
let
us
say
not
clear.
it
became
more
clearer
because
how
he
said
nothing
is
very
demeanor,
burning
a
flag,
running
to
another
corner,
waving
his
arms
in
an
agitated
condition.
those
words
--
mr.
harry
brodbar
i
can
agree
with
that
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
harry
brodbar
it
is
our
opinion
that
the
acts
--
that
the
postscription
of
the
statute
is
directed
at
physical
acts
of
mutilation,
defacing,
defiling,
trampling
upon,
and
that
also
the
statute
post
scribes
the
use
of
language
which
also
defies
or
past
contempt
upon
the
flag.
that
the
words
past
contempt
is
the
--
are
the
keywords
which
direct
the
all
of
the
other
language
that
the
language
indicates
dishonor
something
purposeful.
a
lively
sense
of
shaming
that's
either
one
or
the
other
or
both
in
this
particular
case,
there
was
only
one
thing
that
the
appellant
had
done
burn
the
flag,
his
statement
was
not
contemptuous.
it
was
a
statement
if
we
--
if
this
could
happen
to
meredith
we
don't
need
the
american
flag.
there
was
nothing
contemptuous
about
that
statement
and
that
statement
in
the
complaint,
although,
not
contemptuous
is
set
forth
by
the
police
officer
or
the
indicated
it
intent.
it
was
not
necessary
to
have
it
in
the
complaint
itself
because
the
appellant's
act
was
one
of
contempt,
not
only
did
he
set
fire
to
the
flag
according
to
my
adversary
he
came
down
to
the
street
and
put
a
paper
down
on
the
ground.
what
was
the
purpose
of
the
paper,
the
officer
testified
that
there
weren't
no,
was
no
paper.
what
could
with
the
paper
do
if
the
appellant
is
burning
a
flag
and
drops
a
burning
flag
on
the
paper?
it
is
more
likely
that
the
paper
was
there
to
induce
great
of
burning,
that
was
the
purpose
of
the
paper
and
that
the
flag
was
folded.
the
flag
had
been
folded
in
his
drawer,
in
his
chest
of
drawers.
he
was
a
veteran.
the
testimony
indicates
that
he
put
the
flag
on
in
every
holiday.
the
flag
was
not
folded
because
he
showed
respect.
he
came
down
into
the
street,
laid
the
flag
down,
burn
it,
run
to
another
corner,
is
that
the
conduct
of
a
person
who
shows
respect?
when
the
american
legion
has
its
ceremony
once
a
year
to
burn
american
flags,
they
don't
run
to
other
corners
while
they're
burning
the
flags
on
one
corner.
they
stay
with
the
flag
that
is
considered
respect.
these
words
were
not
even
necessary
of
the
complaint.
they
are
mere
surpassage.
mr.
harry
brodbar
the
officer
your
honor,
generally,
the
officer
with
the
assistance
of
a
clerk
in
the
court.
mr.
harry
brodbar
no,
i
can
tell
that
from
a
little
experience
i've
had
in
the
criminal
courts
watching
the
clerks
do
their
work.
the
jury
--
the
clerk
will
pick
up
the
penal
law
of
the
state
new
york
find
the
caption
and
make
an
entry,
incidentally,
mr.
justice
marshall.
this
is
about
the
first
case
from
the
history
of
our
country
where
this
statute
was
even
used
when
patrolman
copeland
made
his
arrest,
he
did
not
know
that
he
made
the
first
arrest
in
the
history
to
state
of
new
york
for
public
burning
of
the
flag.
certainly,
the
court
was
not
what
aware
of
that,
he
would
not
experience
the
statute
of
the
language.
mr.
harry
brodbar
it
would
not
be
the
judge,
your
honor
because
the
judge
would
not
would
--
mr.
harry
brodbar
it
would
be
the
clerk
and
the
officer.
mr.
harry
brodbar
no.
but
i
know
from
custom
in
new
york
court
that
is
the
clerk
and
the
officer
who
do
it.
then
the
case
comes
before
the
judge.
mr.
harry
brodbar
when
the
case
which
its
turn
in
the
calendar,
the
assistant
district
attorney
came
into
the
case
and
tried
the
case
as
we
say
--
mr.
harry
brodbar
did
he
do
what,
your
honor?
mr.
harry
brodbar
he
could
have
but
he
did
not
--
mr.
harry
brodbar
he
did
not
your
honor.
mr.
harry
brodbar
well,
that's
the
effect
of
that
but
your
honor,
mr.
justice
marshall,
in
every
case
when
an
office
or
even
a
book
making
case,
or
on
a
policy
case
an
officer
would
set
forth
exculpatory
statements.
the
mere
fact
that
exculpatory
statements
are
set
forth
is
that
mean
that
is
part
of
a
statute.
the
officer
feels
that
it's
better
for
this
case
to
set
forth
language.
it
explains
the
intent,
the
man's
rare
--
mr.
harry
brodbar
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
harry
brodbar
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
and
the
words
deliberate
are
not
only
brought
out
by
the
conduct
but
also
by
the
words
set
forth
in
the
complaint.
and
i
reiterate
that
the
words
were
not
necessary,
that
the
facts
indicate
contemptuous
treatment
of
the
flag
by
mr.
sidney
street,
that
there
was
no
in
advertence
or
accidental
occurrence.
this
was
planned
that
the
people
who's
partly
around
him
did
not
collect
your
honor
because
he
did
an
in
adverted
act.
mr.
harry
brodbar
yes,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
harry
brodbar
no,
from
his
conduct.
mr.
harry
brodbar
from
his
agitated
condition,
from
his
anger.
one
does
not
simply
burn
a
flag
with
contend
gently.
there's
an
atmosphere,
it
is
an
emotional
about
an
act
like
that
when
a
mute
--
a
deaf
mute
can
show
contempt
for
the
flag
by
burning
it.
can
we
say
that
the
deaf
mute
would
not
be
a
subject
of
the
conviction?
because
he
cannot
say
what
the
language
what
he
means.
it's
what
he
does
and
how
he
does
it.
that
spells
out
the
content
for
the
flag
that
standing
in
this
courtroom.
mr.
harry
brodbar
i
did
answer.
i
did
complete.
mr.
harry
brodbar
yes
it
may
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
harry
brodbar
because
it
interferes
with
substantial
state
interest.
just
as
an
o'brien
against
united
states,
there
was
a
substantial
state
interest,
government
interest
that
a
man
had
a
draft
card.
there
are
substantial
interests
here.
mr.
harry
brodbar
the
interest
here
that
americans
love
their
flag
and
anyone
seeing
a
flag
defiled
will
--
mr.
harry
brodbar
there
was
no
--
a
draft
card
does
not
have
the
significance
of
a
flag.
the
flag
has
great
meaning.
if
a
flag
has
no
meaning
at
all
it
means
that
every
man
who
dies
for
this
flag
was
not
only
dope
by
the
flag
but
it
made
a
mockery
out
of
patriotism.
that
every
man
who
lies
on
only
cemetery
died
for
something
that
was
just
a
cloth,
a
piece
of
cloth,
which
had
no
meaning
at
all
to
them
and
now
we
say
the
flag
has
no
meaning.
it
is
like
a
--
it
is
greater
than
a
draft
card.
we
are
inculcated
with
the
spirit
of
a
flag
from
early
childhood.
a
card
is
nothing
in
reality.
it
does
not
send
me
to
retaliation
with
one
were
to
burn
his
draft
card.
i
might
be
annoyed
what
the
infantile
conduct.
mr.
harry
brodbar
yes,
i
have
your
honor.
mr.
harry
brodbar
yes,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
harry
brodbar
there
is
a
national
interest
in
the
american
flag.
mr.
harry
brodbar
the
state
interest
is
to
protect
the
national
symbol
because
the
state
is
part
of
a
nation.
if
a
nation
does
not
exist
the
state
will
not
exist.
in
halter
against
nebraska
the
first
mr.
justice
harlan
said
to
the
state
has
the
same
interest,
an
interest
to
course
respect
not
to
mandate
respect
as
a
bond
that
but
to
prevent
desecration.
mr.
harry
brodbar
yes,
mr.
justice
stewart.
but
the
case
still
has
great
significance
today.
mr.
harry
brodbar
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
harry
brodbar
well,
mr.
justice
fortas
this
is
not
--
mr.
harry
brodbar
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
harry
brodbar
mr.
justice
fortas,
we
maintain
that
the
statute
is
divisible
that
this
court
may
ignore
the
language
of
the
statute
which
speaks
of
words
because
the
opponent
was
and
i
think
before
action
--
mr.
harry
brodbar
i
intend
--
mr.
harry
brodbar
yes,
i
do.
i
defend
it
because
the
words
of
contempt
get
the
same
result
as
the
acts
of
contempt.
mr.
harry
brodbar
words
are
just
the
same
words
as
we
had,
they're
fighting
words,
they're
the
words
that
we
had
in
chaplinsky
against
new
hampshire,
when
a
man's
flag
is
degraded?
do
we
not
degrade
the
man
himself?
mr.
harry
brodbar
do
we
not
say
you
are
a
citizen
of
a
country,
are
these
not
worth
nothing?
mr.
harry
brodbar
well,
in
the
event
that
this
court
should
it
in
its
wisdom
feel
that
the
words
are
unconstitutional,
that
we'd
be
blessed
with
some
statute.
that
is
the
only
purpose
i
say
that.
mr.
harry
brodbar
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
harry
brodbar
well,
it
appears
that
way,
because
chief
judge
fuld
makes
the
statement,
“subdivision
16
of
section
1425
is
designed

--
mr.
harry
brodbar
that
is
on
page
8
a
of
the
record.
“it's
designed
to
prevent
the
outbreak
of
such
violence
by
discouraging
contemptuous
and
insulting
treatment
of
the
flag
in
public.”
it
is
our
opinion
and
this
was
me
a
dictum
--
victim
in
a
case,
but
it
shows
the
inherent
feeling
of
chief
judge
fuld
speaking
for
the
entire
court
that
even
if
this
case
had
just
words
in
it
that
the
decision
might
be
the
same.
mr.
harry
brodbar
yes,
treatment
is
a
broad
term
and
includes
conduct,
it
includes
words,
it's
an
attitude,
it's
a
behavior.
mr.
harry
brodbar
yes.
mr.
harry
brodbar
yes,
mr.
chief
justice
warren.
treatment
of
the
flag,
when
one
insults
another
he
treats
it
wrongly,
does
he
not?
the
word
treatment
is
a
general
word.
but
i
say
if
the
court
was
not
concerned
at
the
particular
time
of
the
decision
with
any
words,
but
just
with
the
act.
mr.
harry
brodbar
i
would
say
this
was
an
observation
made
by
chief
judge
fuld
by
way
of
passing.
he
may
have
meant
the
act
--
mr.
harry
brodbar
no.
mr.
harry
brodbar
mr.
chief
justice
warren,
the
way
chief
judge
fuld
starts
the
case,
we
are
concerned
with
the
act
where
he
says
thereafter
is
not
part
of
this
determination
as
he'd
started
out
to
say,
where
he
said,
“we
are
called
upon
to
decide
whether
the
deliberate
act
of
burning.”
mr.
harry
brodbar
no,
i
would
say
that
the
--
mr.
harry
brodbar
well,
my
point
is
this
that
the
court
was
concerned
primarily
with
the
conduct.
the
court
was
not
considering
the
word
itself,
the
language
used
by
judge
fuld
later
on
is
dictum
that
is
the
opinion
i
have.
and
it's
also
in
my
belief
that
if
the
defendant
had
been
charged
with
words
only
and
no
act
at
all
that
the
decision
would
have
been
the
same.
but
the
court
was
concerned
only
with
the
act,
it
prefixes
its
opinion
with
the
statement.
mr.
harry
brodbar
that
is
my
respectful
opinion,
your
honor.
mr.
harry
brodbar
well,
speaking
views
about
a
flag
may
convey
a
message,
what
message
is
there
in
contempt?
mr.
harry
brodbar
no,
i'm
not
saying
that
mr.
justice
black,
i
am
saying
that
criticizing
the
flag
is
one
thing.
mr.
harry
brodbar
no
i
don't
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
harry
brodbar
i
am
concerned
with
this
court's
attitude
with
regards
to
words,
and
perhaps
that
this
court
may
decide
that
part
of
the
statute
is
dead.
i
am
here,
not
to
defend
my
flag
in
quiet
whispers,
but
to
try
to
defend
the
entire
statute
and
we've
open
the
door
to
contempt
by
use
of
words
should
this
court
find
that
the
act
is
proper,
the
act
is
actionable,
that
is
my
purpose.
mr.
harry
brodbar
no,
i
did
not
say
that.
he
can
express
his
views,
but
contempt,
profanity,
obscenity
toward
a
flag
is
not
a
message.
mr.
harry
brodbar
well,
how
else
can
one
--
mr.
harry
brodbar
how
else
can
one
show
contempt
for
the
flag
by
way
of
words,
except
by
the
use
of
epithets,
obscenity
or
profanity,
and
if
he
does
it
that
way,
what
is
the
message
he
is
conveying?
is
he
trying
to
change
government?
there
is
no
message
at
all.
he
recognizes
nothing
good
in
america
when
he
said
that,
he
has
consign
america
to
the
flames
of
obscurity,
that
is
not
the
message.
if
he
said
that
our
country
is
not
giving
me
the
proper
rights.
that
is
a
message
that
deserves
respect
under
the
first
amendment
because
at
least
the
governmental
self
improvement,
but
to
desecrate
a
flag
by
words,
leaves
no
message.
what
is
he
trying
to
say,
that
our
government
is
bad
because
of
this?
because
of
that?
he
says
nothing.
mr.
harry
brodbar
but
the
statute
does
not
cover
criticism
in
‘pure
language,
it
covers
contempt,
defiance.
mr.
harry
brodbar
criticism
is
a
--
mr.
harry
brodbar
but
when
he
talks
about
the
flag,
he's
not
talking
about.
he
is
talking
about
its
disaster,
it's
anarchy,
it's
chaos.
mr.
harry
brodbar
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
that,
when
a
parent
says
that
my
friend's
daughter
is
prettier
than
mine,
does
she
show
less
love
for
his
daughter?
mr.
harry
brodbar
no,
it
would
not.
mr.
harry
brodbar
because
that
is
not
the
contempt
that
is
meant,
our
favorable
criticism
are
not
just
point
of
view.
someone
maybe
partial
to
certain
colors,
that
is
not
the
contempt
meant.
mr.
harry
brodbar
criticism
is
not
contempt,
if
my
adversary
is
shorter
than
i
am
--
i
show
no
contempt
by
saying
that.
mere
criticism
of
a
flag
as
to
its
color
scheme
or
design
is
not
contempt.
mr.
harry
brodbar
well,
if
you
were
serious,
i
would
still
think
it
was
not
contempt.
mr.
harry
brodbar
well,
the
point
is
the
defendant
was
charged
and
convicted
of
the
act
of
burning,
so
this
talk
about
words
might
not
be
before
this
court,
but
i
hope
it
stays
before
the
court.
pardon
me
mr.
justice
black?
mr.
harry
brodbar
the
whole
case
--
mr.
harry
brodbar
the
case
deals
with
only
the
appellant's
act
of
burning
a
flag,
but
it
is
our
wish,
the
wish
of
the
state
of
new
york
that
this
court
would
determine
the
entire
statute.
and
if
it
should
hold
that
the
words
are
in
violation
of
the
first
amendment,
that
the
act
be
divisible,
that
the
statute
be
divisible
and
that
they
be
left
for
the
state
of
new
york
to
enforce
desecration
by
act.
mr.
harry
brodbar
it
does
not
but
the
logical
reading
of
it,
the
federal
statute
just
pass,
does
not
have
words,
so
it
could
stand
alone,
it
could
stand
with
just
the
act
--
mr.
harry
brodbar
there
is
no
language
in
the
statute
which
--
mr.
harry
brodbar
no,
but
there
is
a
strong
presumption
of
constitutionality
and
there
is
also
a
presumption
that
every
part
of
the
statute
fall
that
the
rest
may
remain,
unless
it
is
impossible
to
keep
the
remaining
part
of
the
statute
--
mr.
harry
brodbar
the
presumption
of
constitutionality
is
the
strongest
presumption.
however,
if
the
court
should
feel
that
part
of
the
statute
is
dead
then
there
is
also
a
presumption,
the
remaining
part
of
the
statute
can
stand,
unless
that
it's
impossible
to
consider
itself.
mr.
harry
brodbar
that
is
the
law
of
the
nation,
the
law
of
--
mr.
harry
brodbar
yes,
we
have
a
construction
statutes
in
new
york
to
give
these
meaning
to
a
statutes
that
if
part
of
a
statute
is
bad,
the
court
will
try
to
uphold
a
balance,
unless
it
is
impossible
for
it
to
stand
alone.
mr.
harry
brodbar
thank
you.
