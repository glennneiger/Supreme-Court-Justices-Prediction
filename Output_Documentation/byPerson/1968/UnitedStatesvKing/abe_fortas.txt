justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
suppose
that
your
position
that
if
the
government
says
that
--
if
the
statute
says
its
sovereign
immunity
is
waived
with
respect
to
this
category
of
claims
against
the
united
states
then
that's
a
waiver
that
makes
--
that
opens
the
door
to
whatever
remedy
a
court
may
apply,
is
that
your
position?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
on
the
other
hand,
i
suppose
that
the
argument
is
that
the
united
states
waived
sovereign
immunity
but
only
for
purposes
of
permitting
a
judgment
for
money
and
not
for
purposes
of
obtaining
declaratory
relief.
justice
abe
fortas
and
your
position
is
that
once
a
government
has
waived
sovereign
immunity
with
respect
to
a
particular
subject
matter,
the
restriction
on
the
form
of
action
is
of
no
consequence.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that's
really
the
issue
here,
it
seems
to
me
i'm
not
sure
that
i'm
help
by
talking
about
it
in
terms
of
jurisdiction
that
the
question
maybe
here
whether
the
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
by
in
the
statute
which
is
a
consent
to
be
sued
for
money
judgment
also
operates
as
a
consent
to
be
sued
and
declaratory
judgment
action.
justice
abe
fortas
oh,
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
in
short,
a
declaratory
judgment.
well,
i'm
sure
it
seem
to
me
it
have
to
take
that
position.
it
seems
to
me
that
involved
in
this
case
are
two
questions.
one,
does
the
court
of
claims
--
does
the
declaratory
judgment
statute
make
available
as
a
matter
of
theory
that's
sort
of
a
instrumentality
that
sort
of
remedy
to
the
court
of
claims?
and
your
argument
is
that
it
does
and
i've
listened
to
that
and
read
what
you
got
to
say
in
your
brief.
but
the
next
question
is
when
the
united
states
consented
to
be
sued
in
the
court
of
claims
by
way
of
an
action
for
money
judgment,
does
that
extend,
does
that
consent
to
be
sued
also
extend
to
a
consent
to
be
sued
for
declaratory
judgment
in
the
court
of
claims
in
this
type
of
situation?
justice
