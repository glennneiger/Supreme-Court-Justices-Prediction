mr.
neil
b.
kabatchnick
mr.
chief
justice,
if
it
please
the
court.
it
is
the
respondent's
position
that
the
decision
below
holding
that
the
declaratory
judgment
act
does
apply
to
the
united
states
court
of
claims
was
correct
and
that
the
decision
below
should
be
affirmed.
the
considerations
before
the
court
revealing
the
correctness
of
the
decision
below
is
readily
apparent
from
an
examination
of
the
provisions
of
28
u.s.c.
2201
the
declaratory
judgment
act
and
28
u.s.c.
451.
as
the
court
is
aware
the
declaratory
judgment
act
says
in
pertinent
of
part
that
any
court
of
the
united
states
in
a
natural
controversy
within
its
jurisdiction
may
declare
the
rights
and
other
legal
relations
of
the
parties
whether
or
not
further
relief
is
or
could
be
sought.
of
course
the
keyword
from
respondent's
point
of
view
is
the
word
“any”
any
court
of
the
united
states.
court
will
recall
that
in
the
original
declaratory
judgment
act
passed
in
1934
the
language
of
the
act
was
the
courts
of
the
united
states
and
that
in
the
recodification
in
1948,
the
language
was
changed
to
read
any
court
of
the
united
states.
it
would
seem
that
on
its
face
without
going
beyond
the
bounds
of
section
2201
and
examination
of
that
language
of
that
phraseology
would
readily
cause
anyone
to
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
declaratory
judgment
act
does
apply
to
the
united
states
court
of
claims.
mr.
neil
b.
kabatchnick
sir,
i
find
nothing
if
following
my
theory
if
it
is
correct
in
going
to
the
provisions
of
section
451
and
the
term
court
of
united
states
as
defined
there.
the
tax
court
is
not
specifically
identified
within
the
language
of
section
451
and
--
mr.
neil
b.
kabatchnick
sir?
mr.
neil
b.
kabatchnick
if
as
a
court
of
the
united
states
i
would
think
that
it
is
but
it's
not
expressly
identified
within
section
451
which
--
mr.
neil
b.
kabatchnick
no,
sir.
mr.
neil
b.
kabatchnick
yes,
sir.
mr.
neil
b.
kabatchnick
yes,
sir.
that
is
expressly
if
my
--
if
respondent's
theory
is
correct
it
would
apply
to
the
court
of
customs
appeals
which
is
expressly
stated
in
section
451
as
being
within
the
term
“court
of
the
united
states.”
as
i
indicated
earlier
if
it
was
believed
that
we
would
have
to
go
outside
the
bounds
of
section
2201
to
find
a
definition
of
the
term
“court
of
the
united
states”
as
respondent
has
pointed
out
we
could
go
to
section
451
of
title
28
which
defines
court
of
the
united
states.
and
within
that
definition
of
course
there
is
the
term
or
the
designation
of
the
court
of
claims
in
expressed
language.
now,
i
believe
it
is
significant
that
at
the
time
of
the
original
passage
of
the
declaratory
judgment
act
in
1934
in
many
of
the
decisions
holding
that
the
act
did
not
apply
to
the
united
states
that
the
expressed
statutory
definition
of
a
court
of
the
united
states
was
not
contained
explicitly
in
the
judicial
code.
therefore,
i
believe
the
court
need
not
go
beyond
an
examination
of
the
terms
of
section
2201
and
section
451
to
find
expressed
language
indicating
that
the
declaratory
judgment
act
does
apply
to
the
united
states
court
of
claims.
now,
considerable
discussion
was
made
of
the
matter
of
the
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
which
would
permit
the
declaratory
--
the
united
states
court
of
claims
to
apply
that
procedural
remedy
and
proceedings
within
its
jurisdiction.
i
submit
that
section
1491
the
tucker
act
is
the
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
is
this
statute
which
permits
the
united
states
court
of
claims
to
apply
the
procedural
remedy
accorded
by
the
declaratory
judgment
act
to
proceedings
within
its
jurisdiction.
as
the
court
held
in
the
aetna
life
insurance
company
versus
haworth
at
330
u.s.
227
in
1937,
the
operation
of
the
act
is
procedural
only.
as
the
court
in
the
scaly
oil
case
said
it
does
not
enlarge
the
range
of
remedies.
it
does
not
expand
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court.
and
i
think
it's
quite
significant
in
assessing
the
merit
of
the
decision
of
the
court
below
that
the
court
and
respondent
respectfully
invites
of
the
court's
attention
to
the
language
in
the
scaly
oil
case
where
the
court
said
that
before
the
declaratory
judgment
act,
the
federal
court
would
entertain
a
suit
on
a
contract
only
if,
and
this
was
a
contract
action
if
the
plaintiff
asked
for
an
immediately
enforceable
remedy
like
money
damages
or
an
injunction.
then
the
court
went
on
at
page
671,
672
to
say,
the
declaratory
judgment
act
allow
the
relief
to
be
given
by
way
of
recognizing
the
plaintiff's
right
even
though
no
immediate
enforcement
of
it
was
earnest.
and
i
think
this
is
the
essence
of
the
holding
of
the
court
below.
i
would
like
to
point
out
in
connection
with
mr.
ruckelshaus'
argument
that
examination
of
the
order
entered
on
february,
i
believe
it
was
february
10,
1967
which
is
set
out
in
the
appendix.
i
believe
at
page
a-12
that
the
court
of
claims
did
not
dismiss
the
respondent's
original
petition
and
did
not
dismiss
it
on
the
grounds
that
it
was
a
tax
refund
case.
the
court
said
so
far
as
it
appeared
at
that
time
that
appears
at
the
only
possibly
basis
that
the
united
states,
the
action
could
be
maintain
was
under
the
declaratory
judgment
act,
leave
was
given
to
file
briefs
and
argue
the
matters
no
matter
was
argued
and
ultimately
the
court
rendered
the
decision
below
that
it's
before
the
court's
consideration
today.
so
if
the
court
did
not
dismiss
the
action
below
as
a
tax
refund
case.
now,
i
think
it's
extremely
significant
here
to
understand
and
there
are
some
intricacies,
the
operation
and
the
theory
of
respondent's
case
below.
respondent
has
persistently
as
the
record
in
this
case
shows
and
the
briefs
below,
the
briefs
here
that
this
is
not
a
tax
refund
case.
respondent's
claim
is
a
claim
for
physical
disability
retired
pay
which
put
for
the
action
of
the
secretary
of
the
army
before
july
31,
1959
the
day
of
retirement
and
but
for
his
actions
afterward
where
he
sought
administrative
relief,
that
the
respondent
would've
been
paid
physical
disability
retired
pay.
the
gross
amount
of
which
is
the
same,
75%
whether
by
disability
retirement
or
by
longevity.
however,
if
he
had
retired
for
physical
disability
in
july
31,
1959
he
would've
receive
75%
the
total
amount
due
him,
his
basic
pay
provided
by
statute.
if
he
had
been
retired
by
reason
as
he
was
here
for
longevity,
a
portion
of
that
75%
was
deducted
by
operational
law
as
and
it
happens
here
to
be
income
tax.
now,
the
respondent
went
to
the
army
board
for
the
correction
of
military
records
under
10
u.s.c.
1552
in
august
of
1959
asking
that
his
records
be
corrected
to
show
that
he
was
retired
by
reason
of
physical
disability.
as
pointed
out
and
i
would
particularly
and
respectfully
invite
the
board's
attention
to
the
subject
matter
of
footnote
4
on
page
4
of
respondent's
brief
where
the
respondent
has
endeavored
to
specifically
identify
what
would've
happen
had
his
records
been
corrected.
if
the
respondent's
records
have
been
corrected
in
1961
pursuant
to
his
application,
his
records
by
operation
of
law
under
10
u.s.c.
1552
would've
been
corrected
to
show
that
he
was
retired
by
reason
of
physical
disability.
in
other
words,
not
for
one
second
would
the
respondent
by
operation
of
law
under
1552
ever
have
been
deemed
to
have
been
retired
for
longevity.
his
records
would
have
been
in
all
records
of
the
department
of
the
army
would
have
been
corrected
to
show
that
for
all
times,
for
all
purposes
he
had
been
retired
by
reason
of
physical
disability.
as
a
result
of
such
a
correction
of
the
record
as
respondent
has
endeavored
to
point
out
in
this
footnote.
the
department
of
army
under
10
u.s.c.
1552
(c)
by
that
statute
from
current
applicable
appropriations
of
that
board,
department
of
the
army,
funds
would
have
been
used
to
pay
the
full
75%
or
that
amount
that
would
have
been
due
him
would've
been
paid
out
of
army
appropriations.
and
evidence
of
this
is
indicated
of
how
this
operates
has
indicated
in
the
darby
case,
darby
versus
the
united
states
which
respondent
has
cited
in
the
footnote
below.
and
--
mr.
neil
b.
kabatchnick
yes,
sir.
mr.
neil
b.
kabatchnick
that's
the
actual
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
neil
b.
kabatchnick
my
choice
of
words
might
have
been
--
mr.
neil
b.
kabatchnick
yes,
sir.
mr.
neil
b.
kabatchnick
yes,
justice
stewart.
and
it
is
on
this
theory
that
plaintiff
or
respondent
below
filed
this
action
for
physical
disability
retired
pay
and
i
might
point
out
also
that
had
--
if
these
were
deemed
a
tax
refund
case,
it
was
respondent's
position
below
and
respondent's
position
here
that
going
to
the
tax
and
making
application
for
tax
refund
would
be
a
futile
gesture
on
the
part
of
respondent
because
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
does
not
have
jurisdiction
to
assess
whether
or
not
this
man
was
physically
disable
at
the
time
of
his
retirement
in
1959.
mr.
neil
b.
kabatchnick
he
would
first
--
mr.
neil
b.
kabatchnick
he
could've
brought
an
action
justice
white
in
the
form
of
a
declaratory
judgment
action
to
have
his
--
mr.
neil
b.
kabatchnick
he
would
first
have
to
file
his
application
for
refund
but
this
is
not
and
i
respectfully
submit
--
mr.
neil
b.
kabatchnick
yes,
sir.
mr.
neil
b.
kabatchnick
this
could
possibly
to
be
done
and
this
was
--
mr.
neil
b.
kabatchnick
but
the
court
i
don't
think
the
court
and
i
don't
think
that
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
would
be
a
futile
act
as
far
as
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
is
concerned
because
he
has
no
basis
for
determining
--
mr.
neil
b.
kabatchnick
i
don't
--
i
think
that
the
court
could
if
this
were
a
tax
refund
case,
i
think
that
or
excuse
me,
no
he
could
not
seek
a
declaratory
judgment
because
he
accepted
under
the
exemptions
of
--
mr.
neil
b.
kabatchnick
--
declaratory
judgment
act.
mr.
neil
b.
kabatchnick
as
i
think
that
a
district
court
as
a
disability
retirement
action
could
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
neil
b.
kabatchnick
i
don't
--
mr.
neil
b.
kabatchnick
i
do
not
think
that
the
court
would
possibly
even
reach
that
question
because
there
had
not
been
a
prior
adjudication
or
there
would
be
nothing
before
the
court
as
to
the
merit
or
lack
of
merit
of
the
tax
refund.
and
that's
why
it
was
respondent's
position
justice
white
that
going
to
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
would
be
compelling
the
respondent
here
to
perform
a
futile
gesture
because
it
is
not
taxes
that
he
is
seeking
and
i
–-
this
has
been
consistently
opposite
as
the
court
of
claims
said
below,
the
tax
court
here
are
no
consequences.
the
interpretation
with
tax
statute
is
not
in
question.
it
is
action
arising
out
of
whether
or
not
the
respondent
here
was
unfit
for
general
military
service
or
not
unfit.
mr.
neil
b.
kabatchnick
your
honor,
i
just
feel
and
maybe
counsel
has
failed
to
convey
these
thoughts
of
the
court
and
i
apologize
--
mr.
neil
b.
kabatchnick
that
this
is
--
mr.
neil
b.
kabatchnick
yes,
sir.
that's
correct.
this
is
not
a
tax
refund
suit.
mr.
neil
b.
kabatchnick
well,
i
can't
if
your
honor
i
cannot
speak
with
any
expertise
as
to
the
general
nature
of
a
tax
refund
suit
other
than
as
the
general
term
applies
if
i
may
use
that
phraseology
sir.
if
it
please
the
court,
--
mr.
neil
b.
kabatchnick
yes,
sir.
the
only
place
we
could
go
was
to
the
army
board
for
correction
of
military
records.
that
was
after
retirement
prior
to
retirement
there
were
three
stages,
the
physical
evaluation
board
proceeding,
the
physical
review
counsel
proceeding
and
the
disability
appeal
board
proceeding.
now,
it's
prior
to
--
mr.
neil
b.
kabatchnick
--
retirement
and
i
believe
in
the
petitioner's
brief
in
their
statement
of
the
facts
on
page
3,
they
mentioned
subsequently.
but
i
noticed
that
mr.
ruckelshaus
corrected
this
in
his
narration
of
the
chronology
or
what
the
administrative
processes
were
in
the
court
below.
mr.
neil
b.
kabatchnick
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
neil
b.
kabatchnick
no,
sir.
mr.
neil
b.
kabatchnick
no.
mr.
neil
b.
kabatchnick
all
of
the
available
remedies
have
been
exhausted
and
proceedings
of
the
correctional
records
are
of
course
are
in
the
appendix.
but
i
think
that
basically
getting
back
i
think
to
the
basic
question
here
i
think
that
the
language
of
2201
and
451
are
clear
that
the
act
does
apply
as
far
as
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
that
this
is
carried
forth
in
or
show
by
1491.
now,
--
mr.
neil
b.
kabatchnick
yes.
mr.
neil
b.
kabatchnick
that's
my
understanding.
mr.
neil
b.
kabatchnick
as
to
form
of
action
justice
fortas
it
would
be
a
consequence
but
i'm
thinking
of
the
language
of
describing
what
a
declaratory
proceeding
is
that
is
not
a
proceeding
in
equity
or
a
law
but
a
sui
generis.
it's
also
been
described
as
a
procedural
remedy
as
a
remedy
i
think
that
you
of
course
must
have
the
basic
consent
in
particular
statute
such
as
suits
and
admiralty
act.
mr.
neil
b.
kabatchnick
it
would
be
respondent's
position
justice
fortas
that
where
you
have
consent
to
sue
such
as
in
the
tucker
act
which
gives
you
the
jurisdictional
to
leave,
to
proceed
for
judicial
relief
that
this
waiver
in
the
tucker
act
does
accord
the
claimant
the
right
to
seek
declaratory
relief.
mr.
neil
b.
kabatchnick
as
the
form
of
action
or
as
incidental
portion
of
his
claim,
of
his
monetary
claim
and
as
what's
stated
in
the
pennsylvanian
railway
company
as
a
procedural
step
to
the
accomplishment
or
the
achievement
of
the
receipt
or
to
be
put
in
the
position,
i
believe
it
was
one
of
the
phrases
that
judge
davis
used
below
to
be
put
in
the
position
to
have
this
right,
to
have
a
judicial
statement
of
his
right
to
the
claim
or
a
recognition
of
his
right
to
a
monetary
claim.
mr.
neil
b.
kabatchnick
i
might
in
response
to
your
second
portion
of
your
question,
of
course
the
first
portion,
justice
fortas
my
answer
is
yes
that
the
act,
our
position
if
the
act
does
apply.
as
to
whether
the
consent,
as
i
understand
your
question,
where
their
consent
also
gives
leave
to
not
only
seek
monetary
relief
but
also
declaratory
relief,
my
answer
to
that
would
also
be
in
the
affirmative
for
this
reason.
when
the
tucker
act
or
when
the
first
act
of
establishing
the
court
of
claims
in
1855
and
the
1863
statute,
of
course
we
did
not
have
the
concept
of
declaratory
relief
and
also
of
course
when
the
tucker
act
was
passed
in
1887
we
didn't
have
that.
we
didn't
have
that
until
1934
and
i
believe
that
taking
the
history
of
the
declaratory
judgment
act
and
the
tucker
act
and
of
course
they
didn't,
when
the
congress
passed
the
tucker
act
they
did
invidious
declaratory
relief
and
this
is
an
advent
of
recent
--
comparatively
recent
advantage.
and
i
think
that
looking
in
retrospect
especially
when
it
says
any
claim
it
does
not
say
a
claim
for
present
money
due.
mr.
neil
b.
kabatchnick
yes.
mr.
neil
b.
kabatchnick
that's
correct.
in
fact,
in
the
jones
decision,
united
states
versus
jones
which
reaffirmed
the
lear
decision.
there
was
a
dissent
in
that
decision
that
said
that
even
under
the
1887
act
that
it
was
the
intent
of
the
congress
to
go
beyond
really
monetary
type
of
relief
in
the
court
of
claims.
and
of
course
our
position
is
that
the
utility
of
declaratory
judgment
as
it
released
to
the
court
of
claims
it
would
be
a
procedural
step
and
that
there
is
no
limitation
in
the
declaratory
judgment
act
that
a
consideration
of
both
2201
and
451
leaves
and
readily
apparent
that
the
decision
does
apply.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
neil
b.
kabatchnick
mr.
chief
justice,
if
it
please
the
court.
it
is
the
respondent's
position
that
the
decision
below
holding
that
the
declaratory
judgment
act
does
apply
to
the
united
states
court
of
claims
was
correct
and
that
the
decision
below
should
be
affirmed.
the
considerations
before
the
court
revealing
the
correctness
of
the
decision
below
is
readily
apparent
from
an
examination
of
the
provisions
of
28
u.s.c.
2201
the
declaratory
judgment
act
and
28
u.s.c.
451.
as
the
court
is
aware
the
declaratory
judgment
act
says
in
pertinent
of
part
that
any
court
of
the
united
states
in
a
natural
controversy
within
its
jurisdiction
may
declare
the
rights
and
other
legal
relations
of
the
parties
whether
or
not
further
relief
is
or
could
be
sought.
of
course
the
keyword
from
respondent's
point
of
view
is
the
word
“any”
any
court
of
the
united
states.
court
will
recall
that
in
the
original
declaratory
judgment
act
passed
in
1934
the
language
of
the
act
was
the
courts
of
the
united
states
and
that
in
the
recodification
in
1948,
the
language
was
changed
to
read
any
court
of
the
united
states.
it
would
seem
that
on
its
face
without
going
beyond
the
bounds
of
section
2201
and
examination
of
that
language
of
that
phraseology
would
readily
cause
anyone
to
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
declaratory
judgment
act
does
apply
to
the
united
states
court
of
claims.
mr.
neil
b.
kabatchnick
sir,
i
find
nothing
if
following
my
theory
if
it
is
correct
in
going
to
the
provisions
of
section
451
and
the
term
court
of
united
states
as
defined
there.
the
tax
court
is
not
specifically
identified
within
the
language
of
section
451
and
--
mr.
neil
b.
kabatchnick
sir?
mr.
neil
b.
kabatchnick
if
as
a
court
of
the
united
states
i
would
think
that
it
is
but
it's
not
expressly
identified
within
section
451
which
--
mr.
neil
b.
kabatchnick
no,
sir.
mr.
neil
b.
kabatchnick
yes,
sir.
mr.
neil
b.
kabatchnick
yes,
sir.
that
is
expressly
if
my
--
if
respondent's
theory
is
correct
it
would
apply
to
the
court
of
customs
appeals
which
is
expressly
stated
in
section
451
as
being
within
the
term
“court
of
the
united
states.”
as
i
indicated
earlier
if
it
was
believed
that
we
would
have
to
go
outside
the
bounds
of
section
2201
to
find
a
definition
of
the
term
“court
of
the
united
states”
as
respondent
has
pointed
out
we
could
go
to
section
451
of
title
28
which
defines
court
of
the
united
states.
and
within
that
definition
of
course
there
is
the
term
or
the
designation
of
the
court
of
claims
in
expressed
language.
now,
i
believe
it
is
significant
that
at
the
time
of
the
original
passage
of
the
declaratory
judgment
act
in
1934
in
many
of
the
decisions
holding
that
the
act
did
not
apply
to
the
united
states
that
the
expressed
statutory
definition
of
a
court
of
the
united
states
was
not
contained
explicitly
in
the
judicial
code.
therefore,
i
believe
the
court
need
not
go
beyond
an
examination
of
the
terms
of
section
2201
and
section
451
to
find
expressed
language
indicating
that
the
declaratory
judgment
act
does
apply
to
the
united
states
court
of
claims.
now,
considerable
discussion
was
made
of
the
matter
of
the
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
which
would
permit
the
declaratory
--
the
united
states
court
of
claims
to
apply
that
procedural
remedy
and
proceedings
within
its
jurisdiction.
i
submit
that
section
1491
the
tucker
act
is
the
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
is
this
statute
which
permits
the
united
states
court
of
claims
to
apply
the
procedural
remedy
accorded
by
the
declaratory
judgment
act
to
proceedings
within
its
jurisdiction.
as
the
court
held
in
the
aetna
life
insurance
company
versus
haworth
at
330
u.s.
227
in
1937,
the
operation
of
the
act
is
procedural
only.
as
the
court
in
the
scaly
oil
case
said
it
does
not
enlarge
the
range
of
remedies.
it
does
not
expand
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court.
and
i
think
it's
quite
significant
in
assessing
the
merit
of
the
decision
of
the
court
below
that
the
court
and
respondent
respectfully
invites
of
the
court's
attention
to
the
language
in
the
scaly
oil
case
where
the
court
said
that
before
the
declaratory
judgment
act,
the
federal
court
would
entertain
a
suit
on
a
contract
only
if,
and
this
was
a
contract
action
if
the
plaintiff
asked
for
an
immediately
enforceable
remedy
like
money
damages
or
an
injunction.
then
the
court
went
on
at
page
671,
672
to
say,
the
declaratory
judgment
act
allow
the
relief
to
be
given
by
way
of
recognizing
the
plaintiff's
right
even
though
no
immediate
enforcement
of
it
was
earnest.
and
i
think
this
is
the
essence
of
the
holding
of
the
court
below.
i
would
like
to
point
out
in
connection
with
mr.
ruckelshaus'
argument
that
examination
of
the
order
entered
on
february,
i
believe
it
was
february
10,
1967
which
is
set
out
in
the
appendix.
i
believe
at
page
a-12
that
the
court
of
claims
did
not
dismiss
the
respondent's
original
petition
and
did
not
dismiss
it
on
the
grounds
that
it
was
a
tax
refund
case.
the
court
said
so
far
as
it
appeared
at
that
time
that
appears
at
the
only
possibly
basis
that
the
united
states,
the
action
could
be
maintain
was
under
the
declaratory
judgment
act,
leave
was
given
to
file
briefs
and
argue
the
matters
no
matter
was
argued
and
ultimately
the
court
rendered
the
decision
below
that
it's
before
the
court's
consideration
today.
so
if
the
court
did
not
dismiss
the
action
below
as
a
tax
refund
case.
now,
i
think
it's
extremely
significant
here
to
understand
and
there
are
some
intricacies,
the
operation
and
the
theory
of
respondent's
case
below.
respondent
has
persistently
as
the
record
in
this
case
shows
and
the
briefs
below,
the
briefs
here
that
this
is
not
a
tax
refund
case.
respondent's
claim
is
a
claim
for
physical
disability
retired
pay
which
put
for
the
action
of
the
secretary
of
the
army
before
july
31,
1959
the
day
of
retirement
and
but
for
his
actions
afterward
where
he
sought
administrative
relief,
that
the
respondent
would've
been
paid
physical
disability
retired
pay.
the
gross
amount
of
which
is
the
same,
75%
whether
by
disability
retirement
or
by
longevity.
however,
if
he
had
retired
for
physical
disability
in
july
31,
1959
he
would've
receive
75%
the
total
amount
due
him,
his
basic
pay
provided
by
statute.
if
he
had
been
retired
by
reason
as
he
was
here
for
longevity,
a
portion
of
that
75%
was
deducted
by
operational
law
as
and
it
happens
here
to
be
income
tax.
now,
the
respondent
went
to
the
army
board
for
the
correction
of
military
records
under
10
u.s.c.
1552
in
august
of
1959
asking
that
his
records
be
corrected
to
show
that
he
was
retired
by
reason
of
physical
disability.
as
pointed
out
and
i
would
particularly
and
respectfully
invite
the
board's
attention
to
the
subject
matter
of
footnote
4
on
page
4
of
respondent's
brief
where
the
respondent
has
endeavored
to
specifically
identify
what
would've
happen
had
his
records
been
corrected.
if
the
respondent's
records
have
been
corrected
in
1961
pursuant
to
his
application,
his
records
by
operation
of
law
under
10
u.s.c.
1552
would've
been
corrected
to
show
that
he
was
retired
by
reason
of
physical
disability.
in
other
words,
not
for
one
second
would
the
respondent
by
operation
of
law
under
1552
ever
have
been
deemed
to
have
been
retired
for
longevity.
his
records
would
have
been
in
all
records
of
the
department
of
the
army
would
have
been
corrected
to
show
that
for
all
times,
for
all
purposes
he
had
been
retired
by
reason
of
physical
disability.
as
a
result
of
such
a
correction
of
the
record
as
respondent
has
endeavored
to
point
out
in
this
footnote.
the
department
of
army
under
10
u.s.c.
1552
(c)
by
that
statute
from
current
applicable
appropriations
of
that
board,
department
of
the
army,
funds
would
have
been
used
to
pay
the
full
75%
or
that
amount
that
would
have
been
due
him
would've
been
paid
out
of
army
appropriations.
and
evidence
of
this
is
indicated
of
how
this
operates
has
indicated
in
the
darby
case,
darby
versus
the
united
states
which
respondent
has
cited
in
the
footnote
below.
and
--
mr.
neil
b.
kabatchnick
yes,
sir.
mr.
neil
b.
kabatchnick
that's
the
actual
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
neil
b.
kabatchnick
my
choice
of
words
might
have
been
--
mr.
neil
b.
kabatchnick
yes,
sir.
mr.
neil
b.
kabatchnick
yes,
justice
stewart.
and
it
is
on
this
theory
that
plaintiff
or
respondent
below
filed
this
action
for
physical
disability
retired
pay
and
i
might
point
out
also
that
had
--
if
these
were
deemed
a
tax
refund
case,
it
was
respondent's
position
below
and
respondent's
position
here
that
going
to
the
tax
and
making
application
for
tax
refund
would
be
a
futile
gesture
on
the
part
of
respondent
because
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
does
not
have
jurisdiction
to
assess
whether
or
not
this
man
was
physically
disable
at
the
time
of
his
retirement
in
1959.
mr.
neil
b.
kabatchnick
he
would
first
--
mr.
neil
b.
kabatchnick
he
could've
brought
an
action
justice
white
in
the
form
of
a
declaratory
judgment
action
to
have
his
--
mr.
neil
b.
kabatchnick
he
would
first
have
to
file
his
application
for
refund
but
this
is
not
and
i
respectfully
submit
--
mr.
neil
b.
kabatchnick
yes,
sir.
mr.
neil
b.
kabatchnick
this
could
possibly
to
be
done
and
this
was
--
mr.
neil
b.
kabatchnick
but
the
court
i
don't
think
the
court
and
i
don't
think
that
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
would
be
a
futile
act
as
far
as
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
is
concerned
because
he
has
no
basis
for
determining
--
mr.
neil
b.
kabatchnick
i
don't
--
i
think
that
the
court
could
if
this
were
a
tax
refund
case,
i
think
that
or
excuse
me,
no
he
could
not
seek
a
declaratory
judgment
because
he
accepted
under
the
exemptions
of
--
mr.
neil
b.
kabatchnick
--
declaratory
judgment
act.
mr.
neil
b.
kabatchnick
as
i
think
that
a
district
court
as
a
disability
retirement
action
could
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
neil
b.
kabatchnick
i
don't
--
mr.
neil
b.
kabatchnick
i
do
not
think
that
the
court
would
possibly
even
reach
that
question
because
there
had
not
been
a
prior
adjudication
or
there
would
be
nothing
before
the
court
as
to
the
merit
or
lack
of
merit
of
the
tax
refund.
and
that's
why
it
was
respondent's
position
justice
white
that
going
to
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
would
be
compelling
the
respondent
here
to
perform
a
futile
gesture
because
it
is
not
taxes
that
he
is
seeking
and
i
–-
this
has
been
consistently
opposite
as
the
court
of
claims
said
below,
the
tax
court
here
are
no
consequences.
the
interpretation
with
tax
statute
is
not
in
question.
it
is
action
arising
out
of
whether
or
not
the
respondent
here
was
unfit
for
general
military
service
or
not
unfit.
mr.
neil
b.
kabatchnick
your
honor,
i
just
feel
and
maybe
counsel
has
failed
to
convey
these
thoughts
of
the
court
and
i
apologize
--
mr.
neil
b.
kabatchnick
that
this
is
--
mr.
neil
b.
kabatchnick
yes,
sir.
that's
correct.
this
is
not
a
tax
refund
suit.
mr.
neil
b.
kabatchnick
well,
i
can't
if
your
honor
i
cannot
speak
with
any
expertise
as
to
the
general
nature
of
a
tax
refund
suit
other
than
as
the
general
term
applies
if
i
may
use
that
phraseology
sir.
if
it
please
the
court,
--
mr.
neil
b.
kabatchnick
yes,
sir.
the
only
place
we
could
go
was
to
the
army
board
for
correction
of
military
records.
that
was
after
retirement
prior
to
retirement
there
were
three
stages,
the
physical
evaluation
board
proceeding,
the
physical
review
counsel
proceeding
and
the
disability
appeal
board
proceeding.
now,
it's
prior
to
--
mr.
neil
b.
kabatchnick
--
retirement
and
i
believe
in
the
petitioner's
brief
in
their
statement
of
the
facts
on
page
3,
they
mentioned
subsequently.
but
i
noticed
that
mr.
ruckelshaus
corrected
this
in
his
narration
of
the
chronology
or
what
the
administrative
processes
were
in
the
court
below.
mr.
neil
b.
kabatchnick
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
neil
b.
kabatchnick
no,
sir.
mr.
neil
b.
kabatchnick
no.
mr.
neil
b.
kabatchnick
all
of
the
available
remedies
have
been
exhausted
and
proceedings
of
the
correctional
records
are
of
course
are
in
the
appendix.
but
i
think
that
basically
getting
back
i
think
to
the
basic
question
here
i
think
that
the
language
of
2201
and
451
are
clear
that
the
act
does
apply
as
far
as
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
that
this
is
carried
forth
in
or
show
by
1491.
now,
--
mr.
neil
b.
kabatchnick
yes.
mr.
neil
b.
kabatchnick
that's
my
understanding.
mr.
neil
b.
kabatchnick
as
to
form
of
action
justice
fortas
it
would
be
a
consequence
but
i'm
thinking
of
the
language
of
describing
what
a
declaratory
proceeding
is
that
is
not
a
proceeding
in
equity
or
a
law
but
a
sui
generis.
it's
also
been
described
as
a
procedural
remedy
as
a
remedy
i
think
that
you
of
course
must
have
the
basic
consent
in
particular
statute
such
as
suits
and
admiralty
act.
mr.
neil
b.
kabatchnick
it
would
be
respondent's
position
justice
fortas
that
where
you
have
consent
to
sue
such
as
in
the
tucker
act
which
gives
you
the
jurisdictional
to
leave,
to
proceed
for
judicial
relief
that
this
waiver
in
the
tucker
act
does
accord
the
claimant
the
right
to
seek
declaratory
relief.
mr.
neil
b.
kabatchnick
as
the
form
of
action
or
as
incidental
portion
of
his
claim,
of
his
monetary
claim
and
as
what's
stated
in
the
pennsylvanian
railway
company
as
a
procedural
step
to
the
accomplishment
or
the
achievement
of
the
receipt
or
to
be
put
in
the
position,
i
believe
it
was
one
of
the
phrases
that
judge
davis
used
below
to
be
put
in
the
position
to
have
this
right,
to
have
a
judicial
statement
of
his
right
to
the
claim
or
a
recognition
of
his
right
to
a
monetary
claim.
mr.
neil
b.
kabatchnick
i
might
in
response
to
your
second
portion
of
your
question,
of
course
the
first
portion,
justice
fortas
my
answer
is
yes
that
the
act,
our
position
if
the
act
does
apply.
as
to
whether
the
consent,
as
i
understand
your
question,
where
their
consent
also
gives
leave
to
not
only
seek
monetary
relief
but
also
declaratory
relief,
my
answer
to
that
would
also
be
in
the
affirmative
for
this
reason.
when
the
tucker
act
or
when
the
first
act
of
establishing
the
court
of
claims
in
1855
and
the
1863
statute,
of
course
we
did
not
have
the
concept
of
declaratory
relief
and
also
of
course
when
the
tucker
act
was
passed
in
1887
we
didn't
have
that.
we
didn't
have
that
until
1934
and
i
believe
that
taking
the
history
of
the
declaratory
judgment
act
and
the
tucker
act
and
of
course
they
didn't,
when
the
congress
passed
the
tucker
act
they
did
invidious
declaratory
relief
and
this
is
an
advent
of
recent
--
comparatively
recent
advantage.
and
i
think
that
looking
in
retrospect
especially
when
it
says
any
claim
it
does
not
say
a
claim
for
present
money
due.
mr.
neil
b.
kabatchnick
yes.
mr.
neil
b.
kabatchnick
that's
correct.
in
fact,
in
the
jones
decision,
united
states
versus
jones
which
reaffirmed
the
lear
decision.
there
was
a
dissent
in
that
decision
that
said
that
even
under
the
1887
act
that
it
was
the
intent
of
the
congress
to
go
beyond
really
monetary
type
of
relief
in
the
court
of
claims.
and
of
course
our
position
is
that
the
utility
of
declaratory
judgment
as
it
released
to
the
court
of
claims
it
would
be
a
procedural
step
and
that
there
is
no
limitation
in
the
declaratory
judgment
act
that
a
consideration
of
both
2201
and
451
leaves
and
readily
apparent
that
the
decision
does
apply.
thank
you
very
much.
