mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
the
applicability
of
the
declaratory
judgment
statute
to
the
court
of
claims.
the
decision
of
the
court
of
claims
was
that
the
declaratory
judgment
statute,
the
federal
declaratory
judgment
statute
was
applicable
in
this
case.
statement
of
the
facts
of
this
case
i
think
would
be
in
order
in
order
to
set
the
state
for
this
decision.
colonel
king
who
was
the
respondent
in
this
case
on
may
14,
1959
was
found
physically
unfit
for
active
duty
by
the
army
physical
evaluation
board.
on
june
18,
1959,
this
decision
was
reviewed
by
the
army
physical
review
counsel
and
that
body
found
king
fit
for
duty.
the
latter
decision
was
upheld
by
the
army
physical
disability
appeal
board
on
july
21,
1959
and
king
was
retired
for
longevity
on
july
31,
1959.
in
august
of
1959,
king
filed
an
application
for
correction
of
military
records
with
the
army
board
for
the
correction
of
military
records.
a
hearing
was
held
in
january
of
1961
and
the
application
was
formally
denied
by
the
under
secretary
of
army
on
may
19,
1961
that
ended
king's
procedure
in
the
army
appeal
boards.
on
july
26,
1965,
respondent
king
filed
a
petition
in
the
court
of
claims
alleging
that
the
action
of
the
under
secretary
of
army
was
arbitrary
and
capricious
in
contrary
to
law
and
demanded
judgment
in
an
amount
equal
to
the
taxes
paid
on
his
retirement
since
1959.
now,
the
difference
between
the
retiring
for
longevity
and
for
disability
now
was
that
he
would've
been
paid
75%
of
his
full
pay
as
a
colonel
in
both
instances
except
that
if
he
had
been
retired
for
disability
he
would
not
have
to
pay
any
taxes
on
that
retirement
pay.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
yes,
that's
right
mr.
justice.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
pursuant
to
the
government's
motion
to
dismiss
and
it
asserted
affirmative
defense,
the
court
of
claims
dismissed
respondent
king's
petition
on
the
grounds
that
petition
was
basically
a
claim
for
a
tax
refund.
and
since
king
had
failed
to
file
a
refund
with
the
internal
revenue
service
he
was
barred
from
asserting
it
in
this
suit
pursuant
to
section
26
u.s.c.
7422
(a).
the
court
further
stated
on
its
own
motion
that
the
only
basis
for
maintaining
this
action
was
under
the
declaratory
judgment
act
and
gave
plaintiff
king
--
respondent
king
in
this
case
30
days
to
file
a
brief
on
the
applicability
of
the
declaratory
judgment
act
to
the
court
of
claims.
after
briefs
were
filed,
the
court
ruled
on
february
16,
1968
that
the
declaratory
judgment
act
did
apply
to
the
court
of
claims
and
further
the
court
gave
king
30
days
to
amend
his
petition
and
seek
a
declaration,
“a
declaration
of
his
right
to
be
retired
for
disability
and
to
have
his
military
records
change.”
it
was
from
this
order
of
the
court
of
claims
that
the
government
has
sought
in
this
court
granted
certiorari
to
the
court
below.
now,
this
case
in
its
broader
sense
i
think
involves
the
question
of
whether
the
power
and
authority
of
the
court
of
claims
should
be
appreciably
increased
with
reference
to
suits
against
the
united
states
without
any
additional
grant
of
power
or
authority
from
congress.
i
think
specifically
the
question
before
the
court
is
whether
the
court
of
claims
in
this
case
or
indeed
in
the
broader
sense
in
any
case
as
the
jurisdiction
or
power
to
enter
declaratory
judgment
and
i
might
say
that
the
court
of
claims
for
the
first
time
is
saying
that
cases
which
have
a
money
cast
or
which
are
money-related
or
which
are
money-oriented
confers
jurisdiction
upon
that
court
to
grant
declaratory
judgment.
i
think
that
at
the
outset
it
can
be
stated
that
it
is
agreed
on
the
part
of
the
government
and
on
the
part
of
respondent
an
amicus
that
the
declaratory
judgment
statute
itself
confers
no
jurisdiction
on
the
court
of
claims
or
indeed
on
any
court
by
its
own
terms.
i
think
the
statute
speaks
of
the
power
of
a
united
states
court
to
declare
the
rights
within
its
jurisdiction.
so
the
jurisdiction
for
this
court
of
claims
to
enter
this
declaratory
judgment
had
to
be
found
somewhere
else.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
when
the
court
adjourned,
the
argument
had
just
been
put
forward
that
there
was
no
dispute
between
the
petitioner
and
the
respondent
in
the
amicus
or
the
court
below
for
that
matter
as
to
whether
the
declaratory
judgment
statute
itself
conferred
any
jurisdiction
on
the
court
of
claims
to
hear
or
to
have
the
application
of
declaratory
judgment
statute
applied
to
that
court
because
the
statute
itself
says
that
they
only
have
the
power
or
right
to
declare
rights
within
its
jurisdiction
so
that
that
phrase
within
its
jurisdiction
means
they
must
find
this
jurisdictional
grant
somewhere
other
than
in
the
court
of
--
the
declaratory
judgment
statute
itself.
and
where
the
respondent
and
the
court
below
looked
to
find
that
jurisdiction
is
in
the
tucker
act
and
the
tucker
act
by
its
terms
according
to
the
court
below
on
the
opinion
at
page
--
appendix
on
page
32.
now,
the
court
said
that
mr.
king
could
seek
declaratory
relief
even
though
he
was
“unable
to
obtain
or
request
a
money
judgment.”
and
the
court
then
went
on
to
say
that
the
declaratory
--
the
tucker
act
granted
judgment
in
a
case
of
this
nature
because
of
the
money
cast
or
money
orientation
or
a
money
relatedness
of
the
claim.
now,
that
is
the
contention
of
the
government
that
this
flies
in
the
face
of
the
traditional
grant
of
jurisdiction
to
the
court
of
claims.
it
flies
in
the
face
of
the
years
of
statutes
and
years
of
decisions
that
have
been
handed
down
restricting
that
jurisdiction
to
claims
and
which
a
money
judgment
could
be
awarded.
now,
this
court
itself
in
glidden
versus
zdanok
said
that
from
the
beginning
“from
the
beginning”
that
meaning
the
court
of
claims
has
been
given
jurisdiction
only
to
award
damages
not
specific
relief.
i
think
that
the
argument
of
the
court
of
claims
below
seeking
to
restrict
this
jurisdictional
grant
or
broaden
this
jurisdictional
grant
into
areas
where
there
was
a
money
cast
or
money
orientation
or
money
relatedness
again
flies
in
the
face
of
this
statement
from
glidden
versus
zdanok.
now,
the
court
below
originally
dismissed
this
action
on
the
grounds
that
it
was
a
claim
for
a
tax
refund
and
said
that
since
the
plaintiff
of
the
respondent
herein
had
not
filed
a
tax
refund
claim
pursuant
to
26
u.s.c.
7422
(a)
that
the
court
had
no
jurisdiction.
now,
then,
the
court
invited
the
plaintiff
to
file
a
declaratory
judgment
and
the
plaintiff
filed
a
declaratory
judgment
alleging
essentially
the
same
things
and
in
his
filed
the
brief
favor
of
filing
a
declaratory
judgment
and
when
eventually
it
filed
--
amended
the
petition.
now,
the
plaintiff
asked
for
essentially
the
same
thing
that
he
had
asked
for
in
his
original
petition.
now,
the
only
difference
being
that
it
was
phrased
in
terms
of
a
declaration
of
his
rights.
now,
i
don't
see
how
the
court
of
claims
can
be
said
to
have
expanded
its
jurisdiction
under
declaratory
judgment
act
simply
because
the
claim
itself
as
filed
or
the
petition
as
filed
was
stated
in
a
different
way.
they
really
they
released
that
the
petitioner
was
seeking,
the
plaintiff
was
seeking
herein
was
pretty
much
the
same
thing
that
he
was
seeking
under
his
original
claim.
i
think
the
question
of
whether
it's
a
tax
question
or
not,
the
original
petition
as
filed
really
does
not
concern
this
court
because
if
the
claim
as
originally
filed
or
was
a
tax
question
if
it
was
a
petition
to
recover
tax
money
then
clearly
the
court
is
without
jurisdiction
to
entertain
this
under
declaratory
judgment
act
because
the
declaratory
judgment
act
specifically
precludes
suits
with
respect
to
tax.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
yes
mr.
justice
marshall,
he
did
say
that
the
real
question
was
the
army
regulation
but
i
think
he
was
forced
to
make
that
statement
because
he
had
already
ruled
prior
to
that
time
that
this
was
essentially
a
tax
refund
claim.
and
so
if
he
said
that
it
was
a
--
it
had
to
do
with
the
eventual
tax
refund
then
he
would
be
faced
with
the
same
section
of
28
u.s.c.
7422
that
he
had
dismissed
it
on
previously.
now,
if
he
then
turns
around
and
says
as
he
did
on
the
last
page
of
his
opinion
that
the
only
question
before
the
court
below
is
the
question
of
whether
this
man
was
properly
retired,
then
i
think
he
loses
the
money
cast
or
money
orientation
or
money
relatedness
of
this
claim
which
he
says
it's
necessary
in
order
to
confer
jurisdiction
on
that
court.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
no,
the
minute
he
said
that
the
sole
question
before
the
court
had
to
do
with
whether
the
man
was
properly
retired.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
i
think
he
--
that's
the
last
part
of
his
opinion.
he
said
the
question
before
the
court
in
the
declaratory
judgment
action
that
was
filed
and
he
said
on
page
40
of
the
appendix
the
only
question
he
presents
or
need
present
relate
to
his
retirement
from
the
army.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
and
those
are
the
only
issues
with
which
this
court
will
treat
in
its
further
proceeding
in
this
case.
i
think
that's
once
he
has
said
that,
he
has
lost
his
argument
that
confer
to
jurisdiction
in
the
first
place
that
this
case
had
a
money
cast
to
it
or
money
orientation.
i
don't
think
it's
enough
that
you
can
say
somewhere
in
the
future
way
down
the
line.
the
petitioner
herein
may
be
entitled
to
some
money.
now,
this
i
believe
what
include
virtually
every
case
that
was
filed
in
any
court.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
mr.
justice
white,
i
think
that
the
original
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
that's
what
the
court
below
held
in
its
original
order
to
dismiss
the
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
i
think
on
basis
of
prince
against
united
states,
mr.
justice
white,
the
court
therein
entertained
a
very
similar
fact
situation
herein
in
which
prince
had
filed
a
petition
for
tax
refund
with
the
internal
revenue
service
before
bringing
his
suit
to
determine
whether
he
was
properly
retired.
and
on
the
basis
of
that
case
which
the
government
does
not
completely
accept
by
the
way,
the
court
of
claims
then
when
they
had
to
decided
prince's
case
but
in
this
instance
why
king
did
not
file
a
petition
for
tax
refund
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
i
don't
believe
that
he
could've
had
litigated
or
he
could've
had
the
determination
made
by
the
internal
revenue
service
as
to
whether
(voice
overlap).
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
well,
in
prince
against
united
states,
mr.
prince
did
just
that
mr.
justice
white.
he
had
his
determination
as
to
whether
he's
properly
retired.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
in
the
tax
refund
suit
in
the
court
of
claims.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
well,
if
prince
is
a
proper
holding
and
as
i
say
we
have
some
question
about
that.
i
don't
see
any
reason
why
he
couldn't
because
the
district
courts
have
concurrent
jurisdiction
in
tax
refund
claims.
in
addition
to
that
i
think
that
clearly
king
could've
brought
a
mandamus
action
against
the
secretary
of
army
under
28
u.s.c.
1361
and
requested
a
mandate
against
the
secretary
of
army
to
change
his
records
pursuant
to
an
arbitrary
and
capricious
decision
made
by
the
secretary
of
army.
i
think
he
could've
got
such
a
suit
in
a
district
court
or
could've
got
such
relief
in
the
district
court.
he
did
not
seek
such
relief
in
the
district
court.
clearly,
he
could
not
get
that
relief
in
the
court
of
claims
because
our
case
is
specifically
holding
tht
mandamus
does
not
lie
although
i
think
in
this
case
what
the
court
of
claims
is
in
effect
doing
--
is
doing
indirectly
what
they
can't
do
directly
and
that
is
by
declaring
the
rights
of
king
in
effect
mandating
the
secretary
of
the
army
to
change
his
records.
certainly,
if
king
then
went
into
the
district
court
against
the
secretary
of
army
the
decision
as
to
whether
he
was
properly
retired
would've
been
collaterally
--
the
doctrine
collateral
estoppel
would
apply
to
those
issues
in
the
district
court.
so
i
think
king
had
some
additional
remedies
here
to
the
one
that
he
tried
but
that
he
chose
this
method
in
the
court
of
claims
at
the
invitation
of
the
court
of
claims.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
i
believe
it
is,
justice
black.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
it's
cited
on
page
2
of
justice
davis'
opinion
mr.
justice
black,
its
127
court
of
claims
612.
i
think
that
the
argument
that
is
advance
by
the
respondent
having
to
do
with
legislative
history
of
declaratory
judgment
act
and
of
the
1948
recodification
of
that
act
has
a
very
little
to
do
with
the
determination
of
whether
the
court
of
claims
has
jurisdiction
over
this
case
in
the
first
instance.
and
i
think
the
most
that
can
be
said
for
their
legislative
history
argument
is
that
you
can
show
from
this
history
that
congress
did
not
even
consider
the
court
of
claims
in
enacting
the
declaratory
judgment
statute.
and
that
i
would
emphasize
to
the
court
that
we
are
not
saying
that
the
declaratory
judgment
statute
specifically
excluded
the
court
of
claims
from
its
operation.
i
think
this
is
the
thrust
of
the
argument
of
the
respondent
here
that
the
government
insists
that
the
declaratory
judgment
act
statute
specifically
excluded
the
court
of
claims.
we
do
not
insist
that
i
think
that
what
we
do
say
is
that
before
the
united
states
government
consist
to
be
sued
or
before
sovereign
immunity
is
waived
there
must
be
a
clear
and
expressed
statement
of
that
waiver
on
the
part
of
congress
and
that
there
is
no
such
clear
and
expressed
statement
either
in
the
declaratory
judgment
statute
or
in
the
tucker
act.
and
that
without
such
a
clear
expresses
statement
the
argument
sovereign
immunity
has
been
waived
in
this
case
simply
cannot
stand
up.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
the
tucker
act
states
its
jurisdictional
statement.
the
court
of
claim
shall
have
jurisdiction
to
render
judgment
upon
any
claim
against
the
united
states
found
that
either
upon
the
constitution
or
any
act
of
congress
or
any
regulation
of
an
executive
department
or
upon
any
expressed
or
implied
contract
with
united
states
or
for
liquidated
or
unliquidated
damages
in
cases
not
sounding
in
tort.
i
think
the
language
that
expressly
waives
it
is
where
the
tucker
act
says
to
render
judgment
upon
any
claim.
and
when
the
tucker
act
was
passed,
the
reason
for
the
tucker
act
itself
was
the
fact
that
congress
had
been
inundated
with
private
bills
that
took
up
a
good
percentage
of
their
time
and
they
wanted
this
decision
to
be
made
by
another
court
and
so
traditionally
the
jurisdiction
of
that
court
has
been
limited
to
hearing
claims
for
money
damages.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
i
think
that
would
be
clear
enough
mr.
justice
white
that
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
the
declaratory
judgment
act
simply
said
that
any
court
of
united
states
may
--
has
the
right
to
adjudicate
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
--
within
its
jurisdiction,
he
didn't
say
it
didn't
speak
in
jurisdictional
terms.
it
was
the
creation
of
additional
remedy.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
within
its
jurisdiction
what
it
said
that
the
court
could
issue
a
declaratory
judgment
in
a
case
or
controversy
within
its
jurisdiction.
and
in
this,
i
think
that
means
you
must
find
the
jurisdictional
grant
in
some
statute
other
than
the
declaratory
judgment
statute
and
that's
why
the
court
of
claims
in
the
respondent
herein
is
seeking
to
find
that
jurisdictional
grant
in
the
tucker
act.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
well,
i
think
the
primary
question
was
one
of
rightness
prior
to
the
declaratory
judgment
act
and
there
were
many
--
you
had
to
do
with
a
rightness
of
a
claim
that
some
--
there
were
many
purposes
that
it
was
primarily
to
decide
controversies
between
private
individuals
that
had
not
reached
the
degree
of
rightness
in
which
a
suit
could
normally
be
brought.
and
that
someone
did
not
need
to
act
of
their
parallel
or
did
not
need
to
avoid
act
being
for
fear
of
the
consequences
when
they
could
get
their
rights
determined
in
advance
of
having
the
act.
i
think
that
was
the
original
purpose
of
declaratory
judgment
statute.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
well,
i
think
that
there
was
a
problems
of
rightness
and
problems
of
whether
the
controversy
had
ripened
enough
to
be
determinable
by
a
court,
justiciable
by
a
court
and
that
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
declaratory
judgment
statute
many
cases
were
dismissed
for
being
premature
and
that
many
activities
on
the
part
of
private
individuals
were
inhibited
because
they
could
not
get
their
rights
determined
prior
to
the
time
that
they
acted.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
i
think
that's
right
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
because
there
has
to
be
a
waiver
somewhere
or
consent
to
be
sued
in
all
that
the
congress
has
ever
consented
in
this
area
was
that
the
united
states
could
be
sued
in
the
court
of
claims
for
money
damages.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
well,
i
think
it
goes
further
than
that
because
if
you
are
to
say
that
the
court
of
claims
has
the
power
to
grant
declaratory
judgment
in
areas
where
the
claim
is
not
right,
these
means
that
under
the
general
grant
of
the
tucker
act
to
determine
controversies
in
regarding
governmental
regulation
and
this
amounts
to
a
considerable
increase
in
power
in
the
court
of
claims
whether
you
call
that
additional
remedy
or
additional
jurisdiction.
now,
that
was
not
otherwise
have.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
that's
right.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
i
think
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
i
think
the
problem
mr.
justice
white
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
i
think
it
stops
when
somebody
goes
into
the
court
of
claims
and
request
something
in
addition
to
a
money
judgment
or
other
than
a
money
judgment.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
well,
if
the
court,
i
think
the
problem
is
basically
is
a
problem
between
jurisdiction
and
remedy
and
we
were
talking
about
sovereign
immunity.
we
can
get
into
a
semantic
argument
on
whether
the
declaratory
judgment
act
simply
created
a
new
remedy
and
had
nothing
to
do
with
jurisdiction.
when
viewed
in
light
of
the
tucker
act
or
we
can
look
at
the
whole
situation
of
the
court
of
claims
saying
they
have
the
power
under
the
tucker
act
the
jurisdiction
of
the
tucker
act
to
grant
declaratory
judgment
and
see
that
they
are
exercising
considerably
more
power
than
congress
ever
intended
for
him
to
do
and
that
where
a
court
is
exercising
considerably
more
power
than
they
did
in
the
past
under
a
court
decision
as
regards
united
states
that
before
they
do
that
there
has
to
be
a
clear
consent
on
the
part
of
united
states
to
be
sued.
and
in
this
case
there
was
not
such
a
consent
and
there
was
not
such
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
well,
i
think
that's
exactly
what
the
--
has
been
done
here
mr.
justice
marshall
the
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
the
--
in
the
declaratory
judgment
the
question
of
whether
any
further
relief
can
be
granted
is
a
reserve
in
judge
davis'
opinion
and
the
petitioner
herein
asked
for
a
money
judgment
in
the
form
of
a
declaratory
judgment
petition
and
i
don't
think
that
traditionally
declaratory
judgments
have
been
used
to
grant
money
judgment
and
so
if
and
again
in
this
particular
case
if
what
they're
asking
for
is
a
money
judgment
by
the
court's
own
earlier
decision.
it
is
a
tax
claim
and
as
such
specifically
not
cognizable
(voice
overlap).
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
i'm
sorry
i
didn't
hear
your
question
justice
marshall.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
that's
right.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
no,
there's
nothing
wrong
except
that
the
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
except
against
in
the
court
of
claims
against
united
states.
now,
there
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
well,
i
am
not
maintaining,
mr.
justice
stewart,
in
any
court
because
they
have
issued
some
declaratory
judgments
under
the
admiralty
act
and
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act
where
the
jurisdictional
grant
to
sue
the
united
states
is
considerably
broader
than
it
is
in
the
tucker.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
well,
without
some
jurisdictional
absence,
some
jurisdictional
grant
and
a
clear
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
by
congress,
yes
they
cannot
have
a
declaratory
judgment
act
against
united
states.
and
we
--
it's
our
contention
that
under
the
tucker
act
there
is
no
such
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity.
and
what
the
--
i
think
it's
really
happening
here
is
that
the
court
is
--
the
court
of
claims
is
reaching
out
the
past
judgment
on
a
whole
conglomerate
of
decisions
being
made
by
the
united
states
government
in
attempting
to
infuse
their
jurisdictional
power
into
all
areas
of
governmental
problems
and
governmental
decision
making
that
simply
was
not
contemplated
with
the
tucker
act
and
does
not
contemplate
in
the
jurisdictional
grant
given
at
court
of
claims.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
$10,000.00
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
that
have
held
that,
if
they
try
to
found
jurisdiction
on
the
tucker
act
that
the
declaratory
judgment
action
does
not
lie.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
i
can't
answer
that
mr.
justice
black.
i'm
not
--
i
can't
answer
whether
they
can
or
not.
a
district
court
--
district
courts
have
from
time
to
time
issued
declaratory
judgments
against
united
states
in
specific
statutory
areas
but
i'm
not
aware
that
it
had
been
issued
in
the
tax
court.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
ccpa?
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
to
my
knowledge
they
cannot
either
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
just
point
out
at
the
outset
that
as
to
the
court
decision
below
to
dismiss
the
case
on
--
originally
on
the
ground
since
the
tax
refund
while
the
dismissal
order
itself
is
somewhat
ambiguous
that
judge
davis'
opinion
in
the
record
on
page
13
clearly
states
the
reasons
for
dismissing
the
claim.
he
says
before
bringing
the
suit
here
meaning
king
did
not
however
filed
a
claim
with
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
for
a
refund
of
the
taxes
paid
on
his
retirement
benefits.
and
since
the
internal
revenue
code
of
1954
bars
a
suit
for
taxes
in
the
absence
of
the
timely
refund
claim,
we
issued
an
order
upholding
in
effect
the
government's
defense
that
the
petition
alleges
basically
a
claim
for
refund
of
taxes
paid
on
retirement
pay.
so
the
court
i
think
in
its
decision
did
say
this
was
the
reason
that
it
dismissed
the
case
as
far
as
the
grant,
mr.
justice
fortas,
under
the
tucker
act
of
waiver
of
immunity
here,
i
think
that
so
traditionally
the
term
“claim”
has
meant
money
claim
and
congress
has
never
overturned
that
that
this
court
and
the
court
below
should
not
have
overturned
this
tradition
without
a
clear
congressional
statement
on.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
the
applicability
of
the
declaratory
judgment
statute
to
the
court
of
claims.
the
decision
of
the
court
of
claims
was
that
the
declaratory
judgment
statute,
the
federal
declaratory
judgment
statute
was
applicable
in
this
case.
statement
of
the
facts
of
this
case
i
think
would
be
in
order
in
order
to
set
the
state
for
this
decision.
colonel
king
who
was
the
respondent
in
this
case
on
may
14,
1959
was
found
physically
unfit
for
active
duty
by
the
army
physical
evaluation
board.
on
june
18,
1959,
this
decision
was
reviewed
by
the
army
physical
review
counsel
and
that
body
found
king
fit
for
duty.
the
latter
decision
was
upheld
by
the
army
physical
disability
appeal
board
on
july
21,
1959
and
king
was
retired
for
longevity
on
july
31,
1959.
in
august
of
1959,
king
filed
an
application
for
correction
of
military
records
with
the
army
board
for
the
correction
of
military
records.
a
hearing
was
held
in
january
of
1961
and
the
application
was
formally
denied
by
the
under
secretary
of
army
on
may
19,
1961
that
ended
king's
procedure
in
the
army
appeal
boards.
on
july
26,
1965,
respondent
king
filed
a
petition
in
the
court
of
claims
alleging
that
the
action
of
the
under
secretary
of
army
was
arbitrary
and
capricious
in
contrary
to
law
and
demanded
judgment
in
an
amount
equal
to
the
taxes
paid
on
his
retirement
since
1959.
now,
the
difference
between
the
retiring
for
longevity
and
for
disability
now
was
that
he
would've
been
paid
75%
of
his
full
pay
as
a
colonel
in
both
instances
except
that
if
he
had
been
retired
for
disability
he
would
not
have
to
pay
any
taxes
on
that
retirement
pay.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
yes,
that's
right
mr.
justice.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
pursuant
to
the
government's
motion
to
dismiss
and
it
asserted
affirmative
defense,
the
court
of
claims
dismissed
respondent
king's
petition
on
the
grounds
that
petition
was
basically
a
claim
for
a
tax
refund.
and
since
king
had
failed
to
file
a
refund
with
the
internal
revenue
service
he
was
barred
from
asserting
it
in
this
suit
pursuant
to
section
26
u.s.c.
7422
(a).
the
court
further
stated
on
its
own
motion
that
the
only
basis
for
maintaining
this
action
was
under
the
declaratory
judgment
act
and
gave
plaintiff
king
--
respondent
king
in
this
case
30
days
to
file
a
brief
on
the
applicability
of
the
declaratory
judgment
act
to
the
court
of
claims.
after
briefs
were
filed,
the
court
ruled
on
february
16,
1968
that
the
declaratory
judgment
act
did
apply
to
the
court
of
claims
and
further
the
court
gave
king
30
days
to
amend
his
petition
and
seek
a
declaration,
“a
declaration
of
his
right
to
be
retired
for
disability
and
to
have
his
military
records
change.”
it
was
from
this
order
of
the
court
of
claims
that
the
government
has
sought
in
this
court
granted
certiorari
to
the
court
below.
now,
this
case
in
its
broader
sense
i
think
involves
the
question
of
whether
the
power
and
authority
of
the
court
of
claims
should
be
appreciably
increased
with
reference
to
suits
against
the
united
states
without
any
additional
grant
of
power
or
authority
from
congress.
i
think
specifically
the
question
before
the
court
is
whether
the
court
of
claims
in
this
case
or
indeed
in
the
broader
sense
in
any
case
as
the
jurisdiction
or
power
to
enter
declaratory
judgment
and
i
might
say
that
the
court
of
claims
for
the
first
time
is
saying
that
cases
which
have
a
money
cast
or
which
are
money-related
or
which
are
money-oriented
confers
jurisdiction
upon
that
court
to
grant
declaratory
judgment.
i
think
that
at
the
outset
it
can
be
stated
that
it
is
agreed
on
the
part
of
the
government
and
on
the
part
of
respondent
an
amicus
that
the
declaratory
judgment
statute
itself
confers
no
jurisdiction
on
the
court
of
claims
or
indeed
on
any
court
by
its
own
terms.
i
think
the
statute
speaks
of
the
power
of
a
united
states
court
to
declare
the
rights
within
its
jurisdiction.
so
the
jurisdiction
for
this
court
of
claims
to
enter
this
declaratory
judgment
had
to
be
found
somewhere
else.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
when
the
court
adjourned,
the
argument
had
just
been
put
forward
that
there
was
no
dispute
between
the
petitioner
and
the
respondent
in
the
amicus
or
the
court
below
for
that
matter
as
to
whether
the
declaratory
judgment
statute
itself
conferred
any
jurisdiction
on
the
court
of
claims
to
hear
or
to
have
the
application
of
declaratory
judgment
statute
applied
to
that
court
because
the
statute
itself
says
that
they
only
have
the
power
or
right
to
declare
rights
within
its
jurisdiction
so
that
that
phrase
within
its
jurisdiction
means
they
must
find
this
jurisdictional
grant
somewhere
other
than
in
the
court
of
--
the
declaratory
judgment
statute
itself.
and
where
the
respondent
and
the
court
below
looked
to
find
that
jurisdiction
is
in
the
tucker
act
and
the
tucker
act
by
its
terms
according
to
the
court
below
on
the
opinion
at
page
--
appendix
on
page
32.
now,
the
court
said
that
mr.
king
could
seek
declaratory
relief
even
though
he
was
“unable
to
obtain
or
request
a
money
judgment.”
and
the
court
then
went
on
to
say
that
the
declaratory
--
the
tucker
act
granted
judgment
in
a
case
of
this
nature
because
of
the
money
cast
or
money
orientation
or
a
money
relatedness
of
the
claim.
now,
that
is
the
contention
of
the
government
that
this
flies
in
the
face
of
the
traditional
grant
of
jurisdiction
to
the
court
of
claims.
it
flies
in
the
face
of
the
years
of
statutes
and
years
of
decisions
that
have
been
handed
down
restricting
that
jurisdiction
to
claims
and
which
a
money
judgment
could
be
awarded.
now,
this
court
itself
in
glidden
versus
zdanok
said
that
from
the
beginning
“from
the
beginning”
that
meaning
the
court
of
claims
has
been
given
jurisdiction
only
to
award
damages
not
specific
relief.
i
think
that
the
argument
of
the
court
of
claims
below
seeking
to
restrict
this
jurisdictional
grant
or
broaden
this
jurisdictional
grant
into
areas
where
there
was
a
money
cast
or
money
orientation
or
money
relatedness
again
flies
in
the
face
of
this
statement
from
glidden
versus
zdanok.
now,
the
court
below
originally
dismissed
this
action
on
the
grounds
that
it
was
a
claim
for
a
tax
refund
and
said
that
since
the
plaintiff
of
the
respondent
herein
had
not
filed
a
tax
refund
claim
pursuant
to
26
u.s.c.
7422
(a)
that
the
court
had
no
jurisdiction.
now,
then,
the
court
invited
the
plaintiff
to
file
a
declaratory
judgment
and
the
plaintiff
filed
a
declaratory
judgment
alleging
essentially
the
same
things
and
in
his
filed
the
brief
favor
of
filing
a
declaratory
judgment
and
when
eventually
it
filed
--
amended
the
petition.
now,
the
plaintiff
asked
for
essentially
the
same
thing
that
he
had
asked
for
in
his
original
petition.
now,
the
only
difference
being
that
it
was
phrased
in
terms
of
a
declaration
of
his
rights.
now,
i
don't
see
how
the
court
of
claims
can
be
said
to
have
expanded
its
jurisdiction
under
declaratory
judgment
act
simply
because
the
claim
itself
as
filed
or
the
petition
as
filed
was
stated
in
a
different
way.
they
really
they
released
that
the
petitioner
was
seeking,
the
plaintiff
was
seeking
herein
was
pretty
much
the
same
thing
that
he
was
seeking
under
his
original
claim.
i
think
the
question
of
whether
it's
a
tax
question
or
not,
the
original
petition
as
filed
really
does
not
concern
this
court
because
if
the
claim
as
originally
filed
or
was
a
tax
question
if
it
was
a
petition
to
recover
tax
money
then
clearly
the
court
is
without
jurisdiction
to
entertain
this
under
declaratory
judgment
act
because
the
declaratory
judgment
act
specifically
precludes
suits
with
respect
to
tax.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
yes
mr.
justice
marshall,
he
did
say
that
the
real
question
was
the
army
regulation
but
i
think
he
was
forced
to
make
that
statement
because
he
had
already
ruled
prior
to
that
time
that
this
was
essentially
a
tax
refund
claim.
and
so
if
he
said
that
it
was
a
--
it
had
to
do
with
the
eventual
tax
refund
then
he
would
be
faced
with
the
same
section
of
28
u.s.c.
7422
that
he
had
dismissed
it
on
previously.
now,
if
he
then
turns
around
and
says
as
he
did
on
the
last
page
of
his
opinion
that
the
only
question
before
the
court
below
is
the
question
of
whether
this
man
was
properly
retired,
then
i
think
he
loses
the
money
cast
or
money
orientation
or
money
relatedness
of
this
claim
which
he
says
it's
necessary
in
order
to
confer
jurisdiction
on
that
court.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
no,
the
minute
he
said
that
the
sole
question
before
the
court
had
to
do
with
whether
the
man
was
properly
retired.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
i
think
he
--
that's
the
last
part
of
his
opinion.
he
said
the
question
before
the
court
in
the
declaratory
judgment
action
that
was
filed
and
he
said
on
page
40
of
the
appendix
the
only
question
he
presents
or
need
present
relate
to
his
retirement
from
the
army.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
and
those
are
the
only
issues
with
which
this
court
will
treat
in
its
further
proceeding
in
this
case.
i
think
that's
once
he
has
said
that,
he
has
lost
his
argument
that
confer
to
jurisdiction
in
the
first
place
that
this
case
had
a
money
cast
to
it
or
money
orientation.
i
don't
think
it's
enough
that
you
can
say
somewhere
in
the
future
way
down
the
line.
the
petitioner
herein
may
be
entitled
to
some
money.
now,
this
i
believe
what
include
virtually
every
case
that
was
filed
in
any
court.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
mr.
justice
white,
i
think
that
the
original
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
that's
what
the
court
below
held
in
its
original
order
to
dismiss
the
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
i
think
on
basis
of
prince
against
united
states,
mr.
justice
white,
the
court
therein
entertained
a
very
similar
fact
situation
herein
in
which
prince
had
filed
a
petition
for
tax
refund
with
the
internal
revenue
service
before
bringing
his
suit
to
determine
whether
he
was
properly
retired.
and
on
the
basis
of
that
case
which
the
government
does
not
completely
accept
by
the
way,
the
court
of
claims
then
when
they
had
to
decided
prince's
case
but
in
this
instance
why
king
did
not
file
a
petition
for
tax
refund
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
i
don't
believe
that
he
could've
had
litigated
or
he
could've
had
the
determination
made
by
the
internal
revenue
service
as
to
whether
(voice
overlap).
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
well,
in
prince
against
united
states,
mr.
prince
did
just
that
mr.
justice
white.
he
had
his
determination
as
to
whether
he's
properly
retired.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
in
the
tax
refund
suit
in
the
court
of
claims.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
well,
if
prince
is
a
proper
holding
and
as
i
say
we
have
some
question
about
that.
i
don't
see
any
reason
why
he
couldn't
because
the
district
courts
have
concurrent
jurisdiction
in
tax
refund
claims.
in
addition
to
that
i
think
that
clearly
king
could've
brought
a
mandamus
action
against
the
secretary
of
army
under
28
u.s.c.
1361
and
requested
a
mandate
against
the
secretary
of
army
to
change
his
records
pursuant
to
an
arbitrary
and
capricious
decision
made
by
the
secretary
of
army.
i
think
he
could've
got
such
a
suit
in
a
district
court
or
could've
got
such
relief
in
the
district
court.
he
did
not
seek
such
relief
in
the
district
court.
clearly,
he
could
not
get
that
relief
in
the
court
of
claims
because
our
case
is
specifically
holding
tht
mandamus
does
not
lie
although
i
think
in
this
case
what
the
court
of
claims
is
in
effect
doing
--
is
doing
indirectly
what
they
can't
do
directly
and
that
is
by
declaring
the
rights
of
king
in
effect
mandating
the
secretary
of
the
army
to
change
his
records.
certainly,
if
king
then
went
into
the
district
court
against
the
secretary
of
army
the
decision
as
to
whether
he
was
properly
retired
would've
been
collaterally
--
the
doctrine
collateral
estoppel
would
apply
to
those
issues
in
the
district
court.
so
i
think
king
had
some
additional
remedies
here
to
the
one
that
he
tried
but
that
he
chose
this
method
in
the
court
of
claims
at
the
invitation
of
the
court
of
claims.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
i
believe
it
is,
justice
black.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
it's
cited
on
page
2
of
justice
davis'
opinion
mr.
justice
black,
its
127
court
of
claims
612.
i
think
that
the
argument
that
is
advance
by
the
respondent
having
to
do
with
legislative
history
of
declaratory
judgment
act
and
of
the
1948
recodification
of
that
act
has
a
very
little
to
do
with
the
determination
of
whether
the
court
of
claims
has
jurisdiction
over
this
case
in
the
first
instance.
and
i
think
the
most
that
can
be
said
for
their
legislative
history
argument
is
that
you
can
show
from
this
history
that
congress
did
not
even
consider
the
court
of
claims
in
enacting
the
declaratory
judgment
statute.
and
that
i
would
emphasize
to
the
court
that
we
are
not
saying
that
the
declaratory
judgment
statute
specifically
excluded
the
court
of
claims
from
its
operation.
i
think
this
is
the
thrust
of
the
argument
of
the
respondent
here
that
the
government
insists
that
the
declaratory
judgment
act
statute
specifically
excluded
the
court
of
claims.
we
do
not
insist
that
i
think
that
what
we
do
say
is
that
before
the
united
states
government
consist
to
be
sued
or
before
sovereign
immunity
is
waived
there
must
be
a
clear
and
expressed
statement
of
that
waiver
on
the
part
of
congress
and
that
there
is
no
such
clear
and
expressed
statement
either
in
the
declaratory
judgment
statute
or
in
the
tucker
act.
and
that
without
such
a
clear
expresses
statement
the
argument
sovereign
immunity
has
been
waived
in
this
case
simply
cannot
stand
up.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
the
tucker
act
states
its
jurisdictional
statement.
the
court
of
claim
shall
have
jurisdiction
to
render
judgment
upon
any
claim
against
the
united
states
found
that
either
upon
the
constitution
or
any
act
of
congress
or
any
regulation
of
an
executive
department
or
upon
any
expressed
or
implied
contract
with
united
states
or
for
liquidated
or
unliquidated
damages
in
cases
not
sounding
in
tort.
i
think
the
language
that
expressly
waives
it
is
where
the
tucker
act
says
to
render
judgment
upon
any
claim.
and
when
the
tucker
act
was
passed,
the
reason
for
the
tucker
act
itself
was
the
fact
that
congress
had
been
inundated
with
private
bills
that
took
up
a
good
percentage
of
their
time
and
they
wanted
this
decision
to
be
made
by
another
court
and
so
traditionally
the
jurisdiction
of
that
court
has
been
limited
to
hearing
claims
for
money
damages.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
i
think
that
would
be
clear
enough
mr.
justice
white
that
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
the
declaratory
judgment
act
simply
said
that
any
court
of
united
states
may
--
has
the
right
to
adjudicate
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
--
within
its
jurisdiction,
he
didn't
say
it
didn't
speak
in
jurisdictional
terms.
it
was
the
creation
of
additional
remedy.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
within
its
jurisdiction
what
it
said
that
the
court
could
issue
a
declaratory
judgment
in
a
case
or
controversy
within
its
jurisdiction.
and
in
this,
i
think
that
means
you
must
find
the
jurisdictional
grant
in
some
statute
other
than
the
declaratory
judgment
statute
and
that's
why
the
court
of
claims
in
the
respondent
herein
is
seeking
to
find
that
jurisdictional
grant
in
the
tucker
act.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
well,
i
think
the
primary
question
was
one
of
rightness
prior
to
the
declaratory
judgment
act
and
there
were
many
--
you
had
to
do
with
a
rightness
of
a
claim
that
some
--
there
were
many
purposes
that
it
was
primarily
to
decide
controversies
between
private
individuals
that
had
not
reached
the
degree
of
rightness
in
which
a
suit
could
normally
be
brought.
and
that
someone
did
not
need
to
act
of
their
parallel
or
did
not
need
to
avoid
act
being
for
fear
of
the
consequences
when
they
could
get
their
rights
determined
in
advance
of
having
the
act.
i
think
that
was
the
original
purpose
of
declaratory
judgment
statute.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
well,
i
think
that
there
was
a
problems
of
rightness
and
problems
of
whether
the
controversy
had
ripened
enough
to
be
determinable
by
a
court,
justiciable
by
a
court
and
that
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
declaratory
judgment
statute
many
cases
were
dismissed
for
being
premature
and
that
many
activities
on
the
part
of
private
individuals
were
inhibited
because
they
could
not
get
their
rights
determined
prior
to
the
time
that
they
acted.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
i
think
that's
right
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
because
there
has
to
be
a
waiver
somewhere
or
consent
to
be
sued
in
all
that
the
congress
has
ever
consented
in
this
area
was
that
the
united
states
could
be
sued
in
the
court
of
claims
for
money
damages.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
well,
i
think
it
goes
further
than
that
because
if
you
are
to
say
that
the
court
of
claims
has
the
power
to
grant
declaratory
judgment
in
areas
where
the
claim
is
not
right,
these
means
that
under
the
general
grant
of
the
tucker
act
to
determine
controversies
in
regarding
governmental
regulation
and
this
amounts
to
a
considerable
increase
in
power
in
the
court
of
claims
whether
you
call
that
additional
remedy
or
additional
jurisdiction.
now,
that
was
not
otherwise
have.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
that's
right.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
i
think
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
i
think
the
problem
mr.
justice
white
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
i
think
it
stops
when
somebody
goes
into
the
court
of
claims
and
request
something
in
addition
to
a
money
judgment
or
other
than
a
money
judgment.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
well,
if
the
court,
i
think
the
problem
is
basically
is
a
problem
between
jurisdiction
and
remedy
and
we
were
talking
about
sovereign
immunity.
we
can
get
into
a
semantic
argument
on
whether
the
declaratory
judgment
act
simply
created
a
new
remedy
and
had
nothing
to
do
with
jurisdiction.
when
viewed
in
light
of
the
tucker
act
or
we
can
look
at
the
whole
situation
of
the
court
of
claims
saying
they
have
the
power
under
the
tucker
act
the
jurisdiction
of
the
tucker
act
to
grant
declaratory
judgment
and
see
that
they
are
exercising
considerably
more
power
than
congress
ever
intended
for
him
to
do
and
that
where
a
court
is
exercising
considerably
more
power
than
they
did
in
the
past
under
a
court
decision
as
regards
united
states
that
before
they
do
that
there
has
to
be
a
clear
consent
on
the
part
of
united
states
to
be
sued.
and
in
this
case
there
was
not
such
a
consent
and
there
was
not
such
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
well,
i
think
that's
exactly
what
the
--
has
been
done
here
mr.
justice
marshall
the
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
the
--
in
the
declaratory
judgment
the
question
of
whether
any
further
relief
can
be
granted
is
a
reserve
in
judge
davis'
opinion
and
the
petitioner
herein
asked
for
a
money
judgment
in
the
form
of
a
declaratory
judgment
petition
and
i
don't
think
that
traditionally
declaratory
judgments
have
been
used
to
grant
money
judgment
and
so
if
and
again
in
this
particular
case
if
what
they're
asking
for
is
a
money
judgment
by
the
court's
own
earlier
decision.
it
is
a
tax
claim
and
as
such
specifically
not
cognizable
(voice
overlap).
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
i'm
sorry
i
didn't
hear
your
question
justice
marshall.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
that's
right.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
no,
there's
nothing
wrong
except
that
the
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
except
against
in
the
court
of
claims
against
united
states.
now,
there
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
well,
i
am
not
maintaining,
mr.
justice
stewart,
in
any
court
because
they
have
issued
some
declaratory
judgments
under
the
admiralty
act
and
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act
where
the
jurisdictional
grant
to
sue
the
united
states
is
considerably
broader
than
it
is
in
the
tucker.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
well,
without
some
jurisdictional
absence,
some
jurisdictional
grant
and
a
clear
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
by
congress,
yes
they
cannot
have
a
declaratory
judgment
act
against
united
states.
and
we
--
it's
our
contention
that
under
the
tucker
act
there
is
no
such
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity.
and
what
the
--
i
think
it's
really
happening
here
is
that
the
court
is
--
the
court
of
claims
is
reaching
out
the
past
judgment
on
a
whole
conglomerate
of
decisions
being
made
by
the
united
states
government
in
attempting
to
infuse
their
jurisdictional
power
into
all
areas
of
governmental
problems
and
governmental
decision
making
that
simply
was
not
contemplated
with
the
tucker
act
and
does
not
contemplate
in
the
jurisdictional
grant
given
at
court
of
claims.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
$10,000.00
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
that
have
held
that,
if
they
try
to
found
jurisdiction
on
the
tucker
act
that
the
declaratory
judgment
action
does
not
lie.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
i
can't
answer
that
mr.
justice
black.
i'm
not
--
i
can't
answer
whether
they
can
or
not.
a
district
court
--
district
courts
have
from
time
to
time
issued
declaratory
judgments
against
united
states
in
specific
statutory
areas
but
i'm
not
aware
that
it
had
been
issued
in
the
tax
court.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
ccpa?
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
to
my
knowledge
they
cannot
either
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
just
point
out
at
the
outset
that
as
to
the
court
decision
below
to
dismiss
the
case
on
--
originally
on
the
ground
since
the
tax
refund
while
the
dismissal
order
itself
is
somewhat
ambiguous
that
judge
davis'
opinion
in
the
record
on
page
13
clearly
states
the
reasons
for
dismissing
the
claim.
he
says
before
bringing
the
suit
here
meaning
king
did
not
however
filed
a
claim
with
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
for
a
refund
of
the
taxes
paid
on
his
retirement
benefits.
and
since
the
internal
revenue
code
of
1954
bars
a
suit
for
taxes
in
the
absence
of
the
timely
refund
claim,
we
issued
an
order
upholding
in
effect
the
government's
defense
that
the
petition
alleges
basically
a
claim
for
refund
of
taxes
paid
on
retirement
pay.
so
the
court
i
think
in
its
decision
did
say
this
was
the
reason
that
it
dismissed
the
case
as
far
as
the
grant,
mr.
justice
fortas,
under
the
tucker
act
of
waiver
of
immunity
here,
i
think
that
so
traditionally
the
term
“claim”
has
meant
money
claim
and
congress
has
never
overturned
that
that
this
court
and
the
court
below
should
not
have
overturned
this
tradition
without
a
clear
congressional
statement
on.
