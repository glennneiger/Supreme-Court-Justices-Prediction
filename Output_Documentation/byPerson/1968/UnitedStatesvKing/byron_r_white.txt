justice
byron
r.
white
now,
why
is
it
that
he
couldn't
have
said
in
the
court
of
claims
that
united
states
made
a
mistake
in
retiring
me
and
put
me
in
the
wrong
category
and
by
reason
of
that
mistake
i
am
out
some
money
and
that
the
united
states
told
me
that
money
for
having
cause
me
to
pay
it
out
when
i
shouldn't
have.
now,
what's
wrong
with
that
claim?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
that's
just
a
tax
refund
claim?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
he
says
if
i
were
in
the
right
category
why
if
i
were
retired
in
the
right
category,
well
of
course
i
owe
those
taxes
and
as
long
that
classification
stands
then
why
i
did
all
the
taxes
but
i
want
to
get
rid
of
the
classification.
i
certainly
can't
do
it
in
the
tax
refund
suit.
now,
but
he'd
listen
to
me
in
the
tax
refund
suit
to
review
this
classification
question,
this
is
the
only
place
i
can
go
to
have
this
classification
reviewed
and
this
is
what's
cause
me
the
money.
why
do
you
suppose
that
--
why
would
that
be
thrown
out
of
the
tax
refund
claim
or
as
beyond
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
of
claims?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
in
a
tax
refund
suit
that
in
an
ordinary
tax
refund
suit
that
this
officer
could've
had
had
litigated
the
correctness
of
his
retirement?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
in
that
kind
of
a
suit?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
the
tax
refund
suit?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
in
the
court
of
claims,
yes
but
how
about
the
internal
revenue
service
that
we
won't
look
at
that,
you
just
know
the
tax
if
he
--
could
he
get
adjudicated
in
the
district
court
you
think?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
made
you
to
the
tucker
act
after
the
waiver
as
the
immunity
by
the
united
states
to
the
extent
you
concede
united
states
waiver?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
that
is
harmless
just
amended
the
statute,
the
tucker
act
has
said
the
court
of
claims
now
also
have
jurisdiction
to
adjudicate
declaratory
judgment
act,
he
made
it
to
money
claim
and
that
would
be
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
will
declaratory
judgment
act
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
has
jurisdiction?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
did
speak
about
cases
otherwise
within
its
jurisdiction.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
when
declaratory
judgment
act
was
passed,
what
was
wrong
with
declaratory
judgment
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
there
isn't
--
there
wasn't
jurisdictional
power
regarding
the
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
say
that
the
declaratory
judgment
act
didn't
help
the
court
of
claims
in
declaratory
judgment
situation
because
the
claim
became
once
and
otherwise
this
jurisdiction
in
the
first
place.
justice
byron
r.
white
because
of
the
lack
of
waiving.
justice
byron
r.
white
for
right
of
claims
and
consent
of
money
damage
suit
would
only
mean
that
the
claim
is
sufficiently
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
because
i
understand
your
position
you
do
not
claim
that
the
declaratory
judgment
act
on
its
face
in
speaking
of
the
courts
of
the
united
states
excluded
the
court
of
claims?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
within
the
word
“courts”
is
included
the
court
of
claims
but
the
act
doesn't
give
the
court
of
claims
the
privilege
of
doing
something
that
wasn't
doing
before
because
it
didn't
have
jurisdiction
to
do
so
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
to
issue
declaratory
judgment
because
of
lack
of
consent
for
the
united
states.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
where
does
the
consent
of
the
united
states
stop
in
the
tucker
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
that
ask
for
a
declaration
about
of
money
judgment
but
the
money
judgment
isn't
right
or
not,
or
the
money
claim
isn't
right
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
he
brought
suit
in
a
district
court
for
a
tax
refund
which
i
suppose
he
can
do,
couldn't
he?
justice
byron
r.
white
to
bring
the
suit
he
might
not
want.
he
could
bring
--
could
he
present
the
claim
and
have
it
adjudicated
that
he
had
been
misclassified
upon
retirement?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
a
tax
refund
suit?
justice
byron
r.
white
alright,
he
files
an
application
for
a
tax
refund
that
is
rejected?
justice
byron
r.
white
then
he
sues
in
the
district
court
for
tax
refund?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
he
would
claim
that
i
am
entitled
of
the
tax
refund
because
they
put
me
in
the
wrong
category.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
want
to
know
about
the
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
justice
byron
r.
white
--
is
he
asking
money?
he's
asking
for
a
return
of
taxes
he's
been
paid.
he
says
the
reason
i'm
entitled
to
it
is
that
i
was
put
in
the
wrong
category
and
was
taxed
when
i
shouldn't
have
been.
so,
give
me
my
money
back
here's
the
reason,
now
why
can't
he
have
that
adjudicated
by
a
judge
and
why
can't
the
judge
say,
well
the
army
didn't
make
a
mistake
when
they
retired?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
is
in
a
tax
refund
suit?
justice
byron
r.
white
when
he
sues
for
the
return
of
taxes
couldn't
he
have
adjudicated
in
that
suit
the
army
had
made
a
mistake
and
once
that
was
adjudicated
they
have
a
judgment
for
taxes
he
shouldn't
pay.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
would
be
--
would
you
think
you'd
have
said
something
fatal
if
you
have
answered
me
yes?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
understand
that
you
say
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
but
you
really
weren't
interested
in
the
tax
refund
suit?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
really
--
my
question
is
irrelevant
but
that's
a
fair
(inaudible).
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
why
is
it
that
he
couldn't
have
said
in
the
court
of
claims
that
united
states
made
a
mistake
in
retiring
me
and
put
me
in
the
wrong
category
and
by
reason
of
that
mistake
i
am
out
some
money
and
that
the
united
states
told
me
that
money
for
having
cause
me
to
pay
it
out
when
i
shouldn't
have.
now,
what's
wrong
with
that
claim?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
that's
just
a
tax
refund
claim?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
he
says
if
i
were
in
the
right
category
why
if
i
were
retired
in
the
right
category,
well
of
course
i
owe
those
taxes
and
as
long
that
classification
stands
then
why
i
did
all
the
taxes
but
i
want
to
get
rid
of
the
classification.
i
certainly
can't
do
it
in
the
tax
refund
suit.
now,
but
he'd
listen
to
me
in
the
tax

suit
to
review
this
classification
question,
this
is
the
only
place
i
can
go
to
have
this
classification
reviewed
and
this
is
what's
cause
me
the
money.
why
do
you
suppose
that
--
why
would
that
be
thrown
out
of
the
tax
refund
claim
or
as
beyond
the
jurisdiction
of
the

justice

do

that
in

that

in

justice

well,
in

court
of
claims,
yes
but
how
about
the
internal
revenue
service
that
we
won't
look

that,
you
just
know
the
tax
if
he
--
could
he

you

what

but
what
will
declaratory

act
(inaudible)?
justice
byron

white
has

justice
byron

white
well,
it
did
speak
about
cases
otherwise
within
its
jurisdiction.
justice
byron

white
well,
when
declaratory

act
was
passed,
what
was
wrong
with
declaratory

justice
byron

there
isn't

but
where
does
the

you
mean
that

what
if

which
i

couldn't

he
could

could
he
present

have

that

alright,
he

justice

i
want
to
know
about
the

justice
byron

white
well,
justice
byron
r.
white
--
is
he
asking

he's
asking
for
a

of

he's

he
says
the

i'm
entitled

is
that
i
was

so,
give

why

couldn't
he
have
adjudicated
in

the

they
