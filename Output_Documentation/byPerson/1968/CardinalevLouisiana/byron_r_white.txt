justice
byron
r.
white
but,
as
mr.
justice
stewart
asked
you,
was
the
federal
question
which
you
raised
here
decided
at
all
in
the
lower
courts?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
there’s
been
no
state
decision
on
any
federal
question--
justice
byron
r.
white
in
this
case?
where
do
we
get
jurisdiction
to
hear
the
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
when
the
case
comes
here
from
the
state
court,
doesn’t
our
jurisdiction
depend
on
the
state
court
having
decided
a
federal
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
but,
here,
he’s
now
been
convicted
for
killing
a
different
woman
than
the
one
that
he
had
the--
this
alleged
motive
for
killing.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
but,
i
suppose
there
remains--
still
remains
a
federal
forum
you
can
get
this
question
cited.
justice
byron
r.
white
i’m
not--
justice
byron
r.
white
isn’t
it
also
clear,
however,
that
you
did
raise
a
good
number
of
federal
issues?
justice
byron
r.
white
for
both
the
trial
court
and
the
state
supreme
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
had
them
decided
in
the
state
supreme
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
didn’t
bring
any
of
them
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it’s--
the
only
one
you
brought
here
was
one
that
you
never
took
to
state
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
apparently,
we
are,
too,
now.
justice
byron
r.
white
there
was
also
a
schmerber
point,
wasn’t
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
a
schmerber
point?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
your
supreme
court
relied
on
schmerber
v.
california.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
had
to
do
with
hair
and
the
blood
of
the
victim?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
there
is
a
specific
question
and
direct
examination
that
calls
for
this
prior
crime?
justice
byron
r.
white
didn’t
you
reach
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
didn’t
say
touch.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
constitution
is
a
little
late.
do
you
think
that’s
true?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
object
to
our
deciding
this
case
under
jurisdiction?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you
do
object
to
our
deciding
this
case
at
all
on
jurisdiction.
justice
byron

we’ve

justice
byron

is

they
even
recommended
that
there’d
be
admissions
to
get
into
