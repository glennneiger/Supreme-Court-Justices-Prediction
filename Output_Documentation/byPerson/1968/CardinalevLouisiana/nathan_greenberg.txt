mr.
nathan
greenberg
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
nathan
greenberg.
i’m
an
attorney
from
gretna,
louisiana.
i
represent
the
defendant
in
this
case,
philip
cardinale,
jr.
who
was
the
petitioner
in
this
honorable
court
for
a
petition
for
a
writ
of
certiorari.
the
petitioner
was
convicted
of
the
crime
of
murder
in
plaquemine
parish,
louisiana
and
he
was
sentenced
to
death.
for
his
appeal,
we
originally
perfected
some-14
bills
of
exceptions
which
we
took
to
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
and
we
are
here
before
your
honors
today
on
what
would
probably
amount
to
two
of
the
bills
of
exceptions
which
have
been
combined
together
in
one
the
crux
of
the
issue
before
your
honors
today
is
the
effect
of
testimony
relative
to
prior
offenses
of
the
accused
where
the
accused
has
not
taken
a
stand
in
his
behalf
and
where,
actually,
we
submit
that
the
use
of
the
prior
convictions
in
this
case
was
to
show
nothing
more
than
a
disposition
to
commit
crime
which,
we
submit,
would
violate
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
now,
the
way
this
developed
in
this
matter
was
like
this.
the
accused
turned
himself
in,
in
tucson,
arizona.
and,
while
he
was
in
custody,
he
was
interrogated
by
the
police
there.
now,
this
was
pre-miranda
and
subsequent
escobedo.
so,
the
escobedo
rule
applies.
during
the
course
of
his
custodial
interrogation,
the
petitioner
volunteered
that
he
had
previously
been
convicted
of
an
offense
in
louisiana,
which
offense
was
actually
a
crime
against
nature,
that
after
he
served
his
time
in
new
orleans
parish
prison,
that
he
went
looking
for
the
girl
who
had
charged
him
with
this
crime,
according
to
him,
allegedly
with
a
gun
for
the
purpose
of
killing
her.
now,
he
did
not
find
the
girl.
he
did
not
commit
any
offense
in
connection
with
it,
and
his
statements
relative
to
the
prior
offense
or,
generally,
that
let’s
see--
i’ll
see
if
i
can
read
it.
during
the
course
of
his
custodial
interrogation
in
tucson,
arizona,
he
referred
to
a
prior
conviction
occurring
in
louisiana,
which,
prior
conviction
was
for
a
crime
against
nature
occurring
on
july
12,
1963
and
causing
the
petitioner
to
be
sentenced
to
serve
three
months
in
a
parish
prison
on
march
25,
1964.
petitioner
further
stated,
during
the
course
of
his
custodial
interrogation,
that
after
he
served
his
time
in
new
orleans
parish
prison,
he
went
looking
for
his
alleged
prosecutrix
with
a
gun
for
the
stated
purpose
of
killing
her.
however,
he
never
did
find
her
and,
therefore,
no
further
offense
was
committed.
now,
in
essence,
what
we
have
here
is
a
situation
where
this
reference
to
the
prior
offense
serves
absolutely
no
useful
purpose,
we
respectfully
submit.
the
only
purpose
that
this
link
could
possibly
serve,
we
submit,
is
to
try
to
prejudice
the
jury
to
show
the
jury
that
this
defendant
is
a
bad
man.
this,
of
course,
is
why
we’re
here
before
your
honors
today
because,
here,
we
had
a
situation
where
this
could
very
easily
have
been
separated
from
the
remainder
of
the
statements
of
the
accused.
this
could
very
easily
have
been
excluded,
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
we
sought
to
exclude
it
from
the
time
it
first
came
up.
it
came
up
in
the
opening
statement.
it
came
up
in
the
interrogation
of
the
police
officer.
it
came
up
in
the
closing
argument
by
the
district
attorney.
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
we
sought
to
exclude
at
each
level
of
the
proceedings
or
each
stages
of
proceeding,
it
was
admitted
and
it
was
repeatedly
referred
to
in
the
closing
argument.
mr.
nathan
greenberg
in
the
district
court,
if
your
honor
please,
this
trial
occurred
in
may
of
1966.
this
was
prior
to
the
ruling
of
your
honors
in
the
spencer
case
and,
of
course,
we’ve
picked
up
the
language
of
the
spencer
case
which,
i
believe,
was
in
1967
as
a
basis
of
relying
upon
the
application
for
the
writ
to
this
court
and
the
wording
of
the
dissenting
opinion
by
mr.
chief
justice
warren.
mr.
nathan
greenberg
yes,
sir.
mr.
nathan
greenberg
upon
application
for
the
writ.
mr.
nathan
greenberg
yes.
in
the
trial
court,
what
had
happened
was
that
the
states
ought
to
justify
the
admissibility
of
the
conviction
on
a
basis
of
propensity
or
pattern
and,
of
course,
we
argued
to
the
court
at
this
time
that
there
was
no
pattern
because
the
prior
offense
was
crime
against
nature
and
this,
of
course,
was
murder.
and,
of
course,
the
only
reference
to
the
alleged
looking
for
the
prosecutrix
with
a
gun
and
so
forth
related
to
an
incomplete
offense.
now,
we
did
not
succeed
in
this
respect.
the
state
then
came
in
and
sought
to
justify
the
admissibility
of
the
testimony
on
a
theory
that
this
was
a
part
of
the
entire
confession,
and
the
entire
confession
as
a
whole
must
go
in,
that
louisiana
has
such
a
statute
requiring
this
that
the
entire
confession
go
in.
and,
since
this
defendant
said
this,
regardless
of
what
it
was,
it
must
go
into
evidence.
and,
of
course,
we
respectfully
submit
that
this
should
not
be
so.
for
example,
suppose
the
defendant
made
a
statement
reflecting
upon
character
or
integrity
of
jurors,
for
example.
should
this
go
in
because
it’s
a
part
of
an
alleged
confession?
should
the
prosecution
be
entitled
to
use
this
as
an
attempt
to
prejudice
the
jury
against
the
defendant?
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
issue
in
this
case
is
quite
simple
and
the
issue
is
to
what
extent
the
evidence
of
prior
convictions
should
be
allowed
to
go
in
on
behalf
of
the
prosecution.
mr.
nathan
greenberg
no,
sir,
it
was
not.
mr.
nathan
greenberg
that
is
correct.
mr.
nathan
greenberg
because
of
the
contention
that
the
constitution
was
violated
with
reference
to
the
admissibility
of
the
evidence
per
se,
in
other
words,
the
louisiana
supreme
court
held
that
the
confession
must
be
considered
as
a
whole.
mr.
nathan
greenberg
the
federal
question,
if
your
honor
please,
in
connection
with
this
matter
was
not
raised
in
the
state
court
for
the
reason
that
there
was
no--
in
the
trial
court,
there
was
no
expression
which
actually
hit
this
on
the
button
as
it
did
in
the
dissenting
opinion
in
the
spencer
case
which
came
out
after
this
trial
in
the
state
court.
mr.
nathan
greenberg
no,
sir,
it
was
not.
we
originally--
mr.
nathan
greenberg
no,
sir,
it
did
not.
we
took
the--
mr.
nathan
greenberg
the
issue
as
to
constitutionality
was
not
raised
prior
to
the
time
of
the
preparation
of
the
application
for
the
writ
to
this
court.
mr.
nathan
greenberg
we
submit
that
the
constitutional
issue
is
present,
if
your
honor
please.
this
is
a
question
where
we
have
raised
a
federal
question.
perhaps
the
state
may
not
passed
upon
up
but,
even
though
the
state
may
not
have
passed
upon
it,
it
has
been
raised
in
connection
with
the
application
for
the
writ.
mr.
nathan
greenberg
i
believe
that
i
refer
to
it
at
transcripts,
page
496-510.
mr.
nathan
greenberg
through
510.
mr.
nathan
greenberg
no,
in
the
appendix
we
refer
to
the
bill
of
exceptions,
which,
bill
of
exception
sets
forth
the
actual
reference
to--
as
to
the
manner
in
which
it
was
raised.
the--
in
the
appendix,
i
can
refer
your
honors
to
that.
mr.
nathan
greenberg
yes,
sir,
we
did.
mr.
nathan
greenberg
yes,
sir.
that
is
correct.
we
did
raise
other
issues
relative
to
the
constitutionality
of
various
other
matters
in
the
course
of
the
case,
however,
not
as
to
this
particular--
mr.
nathan
greenberg
now,
i’m
looking
at
the
appendix
here
and,
particularly,
the
bill
of
exceptions
number
3
which
appears
at
page
9,
10,
and
11
of
the
bill--
of
the
appendix,
and
bill
of
exceptions
number
10
which
appears
at
page
12,
13,
and
14.
mr.
nathan
greenberg
this
is--
mr.
nathan
greenberg
correct,
sir.
mr.
nathan
greenberg
this
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
nathan
greenberg
not
in
the
district
court,
no,
sir.
mr.
nathan
greenberg
no,
this
bill
of
exceptions
was
prepared
and
submitted
to
the
trial
judge
and
then--
mr.
nathan
greenberg
these
bills
of
exceptions.
mr.
nathan
greenberg
no,
sir,
not
as
to
bill
of
exceptions
number
3
and
bill
of
exceptions
number
10.
mr.
nathan
greenberg
that
is
correct.
well,
not--
there
were--
permit
me
to
say
this.
we
did
raise
other
federal
constitutional
questions
in
other
bills,
but
this
was
not
the
basis
of
the
application
for
the
writ.
mr.
nathan
greenberg
the
exact
question
which
was
raised
in
the
appellee’s--
mr.
nathan
greenberg
no,
sir,
we
did
not.
mr.
nathan
greenberg
well,
if
your
honor
please,
the
issue
which
we
raised
herein
is
one
which
really
developed
since
the
trial
of
this
case.
this
case
was
concluded,
i
believe,
on
may
5,1966,
and
the
issue
which
was
raised
was
actually
pinpointed
in
your
honors’
decision
of
the
spencer
case
which
was
decided
by
this
honorable
court
in
1967.
and,
insofar
as
the
focusing
of
attention
on
this
issue
was
concerned,
at
that
time,
the
bills
of
exceptions
had
already
been
signed,
the
appeal
had
been
lodged
in
the
state
supreme
court,
and
there
was
no
way
in
which
the
issue
could
be
raised
at
that
time
for
the
very
simple
reason
that,
under
the
state
practice
and
procedure,
we
have
to
raise
the
bills
of
exceptions,
the
basis
of
the
objections
to
the
admissibility
of
the
evidence,
have
them
signed
by
the
trial
court,
and
then
we
take
the
appeal.
so,
there
was
really,
we
submit,
no
way
in
which
we
could
raise
the
issue
at
that
time
because
the
matter
had
already
been
tried,
submitted,
and
the
trial
court
had
lost
jurisdiction.
mr.
nathan
greenberg
yes,
sir,
we
do.
this
is
the
entire
basis
of
the
application
for
the
writ.
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
opinion
in
the
spencer
case,
both
majority
and
dissent,
would
clearly
indicate
that
the
position
of
the
defense
in
this
case
was
correct
that
it
would
be
violative
of
the
due
process
clause.
in
the
spencer
case,
in
the
majority
opinion,
the
majority
stated
petitioners
do
not
even
appear
to
be
arguing
that
the
constitution
is
infringed
if
a
jury
is
told
of
a
defendant’s
prior
crimes.
and
this,
of
course,
is
exactly
what
happened
in
this
particular
case.
the
spencer
case
was
a
habitual
criminal
and
multiple
offender
situation
out
of
texas.
and
of
course,
here,
we
don’t
have
this
case
at
all
because,
here,
we
have
a
situation
where
the
only
thing
which
is
involved
here
is
the
question
of
the
defendant’s
prior
offense
coming
into
evidence
where
a
defendant
has
not
taken
the
stand,
has
not
sought
to
offer
any
character
evidence
or
anything
of
this
type
and
what,
in
essence,
has
occurred
is
that
the
prosecution
says
“well,
since
you,
mr.
defendant,
made
this
statement
during
the
course
of
this
confession,
we
are
entitled
to
bring
it
into
evidence.”
mr.
nathan
greenberg
we
submit
that
this
actually
leaves
our
question
open.
and,
as
was
pointed
out
in
the
dissent,
it
leaves
the
question
open
here
and,
as
was
stated
in
the
dissenting
opinion--
i
have
the
language
quoted
in
the
brief.
“while
this
court
has
never
held
that
the
use
of
prior
convictions
to
show
nothing
more
than
a
disposition
to
commit
crime
would
violate
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
our
decisions
exercising
supervisory
power
over
criminal
trials
in
federal
courts
as
well
as
decisions
by
courts
of
appeal
and
of
state
courts
suggest
that
evidence
of
prior
crimes
introduced
for
no
purpose
other
than
to
show
criminal
disposition
would
violate
the
due
process
clause
and
this,
of
course,
is
exactly
the
situations
which--
mr.
nathan
greenberg
well,
your
honor
is
talking
about
the
propensity
of
pattern-type--
mr.
nathan
greenberg
yes,
sir.
mr.
nathan
greenberg
that’s
correct.
mr.
nathan
greenberg
a
different
woman
here.
mr.
nathan
greenberg
this
was
a
different
woman.
mr.
nathan
greenberg
yes,
sir.
mr.
nathan
greenberg
absolutely,
a
different
woman
at
that
time.
mr.
nathan
greenberg
no,
same
state.
mr.
nathan
greenberg
yes,
sir.
mr.
nathan
greenberg
yes,
sir.
mr.
nathan
greenberg
yes,
sir.
in
other
words,
we
were
placed
in
a
rather
anomalous
position
here
where
the
basis
of
our
application
here
really
occurred
while
this
thing
was
pending,
if
your
honor
please--
if
your
honors
please,
and
we
have
a
situation
where
i
must
admit
in
all
candid
to
the
court
that
the
direct
matter
raised
here
today
was
not
submitted
to
either
the
trial
court
or
the
louisiana
supreme
court.
however,
in
our
research,
we
discovered
the
basis
of
coming
up
here
on
a
federal
question
subsequent
to
the
trial,
subsequent
to
the
time
that
the
bills
of
exceptions
had
been
perfected
and,
of
course,
subsequent
to
the
time
that
the
brief
had
been
prepared
in
louisiana
supreme
court.
mr.
nathan
greenberg
we
don’t
have
any
authorities
to
come
before
your
honor
and
say
“i
know
that
i
can
point
to
such
and
such
a
decision”
and
say
this
is
a
basis
of
it.
mr.
nathan
greenberg
i
do
not.
however,
if
your
honors
want
some
research
on
this,
we
would
be
glad
to
check
the
matter
out
and
submit
a
supplemental
brief
in
connection
with
the
issue.
we
came
up
solely
on
the
basis
of
the
prior
offense
coming
into
evidence
which
we
felt
was
an
unconstitutional
act
on
the
part
of
the
prosecution.
we
raised
it
in
a
different
vein.
there
isn’t
any
question
about
that.
however,
it
really
is
a
question
of
approach.
mr.
nathan
greenberg
well,
in
the
event,
our
rights
of
appeal
would
be
terminated
because
we
came
up
here
in
the
normal
course
of
the
appellant
review.
then,
of
course,
we
would
have
to--
mr.
nathan
greenberg
resort
to
habeas
corpus
in
the
federal
court
system
to
present
the
issue.
in
other
words,
it
would
be
just
like
a
situation
where,
subsequent
to
miranda,
for
example,
a
defendant
was
tried
and
he
didn’t
have
adequate
counsel
and
then
he
came
in
and
sought
to
review
it
by
way
of
habeas
corpus
in
the
federal
court
system.
mr.
nathan
greenberg
the
statute
in
connection
with
the
entirety
of
a
confession?
mr.
nathan
greenberg
we
have
not
researched
this
one
from
a
standpoint
of
other
states,
but
my
recollection
is
that
there
are
some
which
have
a
similar
statute.
mr.
nathan
greenberg
not
in
a
criminal
law
area.
mr.
nathan
greenberg
louisiana
has
a
different
historical
background
from
a
standpoint
of
development
of
the
law
in
the
civil
law
area.
mr.
nathan
greenberg
yes,
sir.
however,
insofar
as
the
law
of
crimes
is
concerned,
it’s
taken
from
the
common
law.
mr.
nathan
greenberg
oh
yes,
sir,
absolutely.
our
civil
law
is
based
upon
the
code
of
napoleon
which,
in
turn,
is
based
upon
the
code
of
justinian.
however,
in
the
law
of
crimes,
our
law
is
taken
directly
from
the
common
law.
it
is,
of
course,
codified
by
statute
today.
we
respectfully
urge
your
honors’
consideration
of
the
issue
which
is
raised
and
which
was--
as
was
pointed
out
and
raised
for
the
first
time
in
this
application
for
a
writ.
we
respectfully
request
the
indulgence
of
the
court
for
additional
time
within
which
to
file
a
supplemental
brief
to
research
the
issue
raised
in
connection
with
the
matter
of
jurisdiction.
it
is,
of
course,
true
that
the
habeas
corpus
remedies
which
are
available
to
petitioner
have
not
been
utilized.
however,
we
felt
that
in
as
much
as
the
time
for
appeal
had
not
yet
run
and
in
as
much
as
the
opportunity
til--
still
presented
itself
for
this
case
to
run
began
through
the
course
of
the
appellate
review,
that
we
should
ask
for
the
application
of
the
writ
of
certiorari,
which
we
did.
and,
of
course,
we
realized
that
we
did
not
raise
this
constitutional
issue
in
the
district
court
or
in
the
supreme
court,
but
the
issues
is,
nevertheless,
existed
in
one
which,
we
submit,
should
warrant
your
honors’
attention
to
the
matter.
we
submit
it
is
a
matter
of
prime
importance.
it’s
a
matter
which
would
have
great
effect
in
connection
with
prosecution
of
criminal
cases,
not
only
in
louisiana
but
in
other
jurisdictions.
what
is
the
effect
of
prior
offenses
where
the
defendant
has
not
taken
the
stand,
has
not
put
the
issue
of
his
character
or
reputation
at
evidence,
and
in
the
course
of
the
confession,
the
defendant
refers
to
the
prior
offense
and
the
prosecution
brings
us
out
as
a
part
of
the
confession
as
a
whole.
we
submit
that
the
evidence
which
was
taken
in
this
case
would
warrant
your
honors’
taking
cognizance
of
the
matter
and
reversing
it.
mr.
nathan
greenberg
well,
there
isn’t
any
doubt
in
my
mind,
but
that
this
was
the
intent
of
the
statute.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
we
have
cited
the
statute
in
the
brief
and,
of
course,
here
one
phase
of
the
statute
is
used
against
us,
and
this
is
the
statute.
every
confession,
admission,
or
declaration
sought
to
be
used
against
anyone
must
be
used
in
its
entirety
so
that
the
person
to
be
affected
thereby
may
have
the
benefit
of
any
exculpation
or
explanation
that
the
whole
statement
may
afford.
so,
actually,
the
exculpatory
proviso
of
the
statute
is
one
which
really
requires
the
utilization
of
the
confession
as
a
whole
and,
here,
the
confession
as
a
whole
is
being
used
to
show
that
the
defendant
is
a
bad
man.
mr.
nathan
greenberg
no,
sir,
it
was
not.
it
was
an
oral
confession.
mr.
nathan
greenberg
yes.
mr.
nathan
greenberg
that
is
correct.
we
respectfully
request
your
honors’
favorable
consideration
of
this
matter.
should
the
court
require
or
wish
supplemental
briefs
on
the
issue
of
jurisdiction,
if
your
honors
would
fix
some
additional
time
within
which
this
matter
can
be
raised,
we
submitted
that
the
matter
that
we
had
jurisdiction
under
the
statutory
provisions
raised.
mr.
nathan
greenberg
yes,
sir,
he
is.
he’s
on
death
row
in
angola
state.
mr.
nathan
greenberg
yes,
sir.
mr.
nathan
greenberg
yes,
sir.
mr.
nathan
greenberg
yes,
sir,
we
do.
mr.
nathan
greenberg
may
i
just
state
this
to
the
court,
if
your
honor
please.
i
note
my
time
is
running
out.
in
as
much
as
a
right
to
review
had
not
been
lost
because
of
the
laps
of
time,
we
sought
to
come
up
by
way
of
application
for
the
writ
of
certiorari
and
we
want
to
make
this
abundantly
clear
to
your
honors
that
we
thought
that
we
should
appeal
in
this
fashion
rather
than
go
to
the--
mr.
nathan
greenberg
oh,
yes.
mr.
nathan
greenberg
absolutely,
sir.
mr.
nathan
greenberg
yes,
sir.
mr.
nathan
greenberg
no,
sir,
not
those.
mr.
nathan
greenberg
that’s
correct.
we
reserved
bills
of
exceptions
in
connection
with
this
matter,
but
it
was
on
a
state
statute.
mr.
nathan
greenberg
that’s
correct.
mr.
nathan
greenberg
no.
mr.
nathan
greenberg
well,
i
was
hopefully
--
mr.
nathan
greenberg
well,
we
felt
that
we
should
try
this
anyway
because
the
delays
have
not
expired.
mr.
nathan
greenberg
we
thank
you
for
your
consideration.
mr.
nathan
greenberg
yes,
sir,
he
had.
mr.
nathan
greenberg
yes,
sir.
mr.
nathan
greenberg
may
it
please
the
court.
i
merely
would
like
to
call
two
matters
to
the
court’s
attention.
at
page
4
and
5
of
the
appendix,
we
set
forth
the
chronology
of
events
and,
in
the
bottom
of
page
4,
it
indicates
that
the
case
was
concluded
friday,
may
6,
that
the
defendant
--
of
1966,
the
defendant
was
sentenced
to
death
on
july
19,
1966.
and,
on
october
6,
1966,
the
per
curiam
on
the
bill
of
exceptions
were
signed
by
the
trial
court.
now,
under
louisiana
law,
the
rule
which
was
in
existence
at
that
time
was
that,
upon
signing
of
the
bill
of
exceptions,
a
trial
court
is
divested
of
jurisdiction
and
any
bills
filed
thereafter
and
presented
to
the
judge
for
his
signature
in
per
curiam
come
too
late
and
cannot
be
considered
on
appeal.
and,
this
is
the
decision
of
state
versus
harrell,
228
louisiana
434,
82
southern
2nd
701.
now
--
mr.
nathan
greenberg
yes,
sir,
absolutely.
now,
the
law
has
since
been
changed
in
louisiana.
we
now
have
a
new
code
of
criminal
procedure.
however,
this
case
was
tried
prior
to
the
effective
date
of
the
code
of
criminal
procedure.
spencer
versus
the
state
of
texas,
which
focused
attention
on
the
issue
raised
herein,
was
decided
--
or
it
was
rather
argued
on
october
17
and
8,
1966
and
was
decided
january
23,
1967
which,
of
course,
was
subsequent
to
the
taking
of
the
appeal,
the
filing
of
the
bills
of
exceptions,
and
the
rendition
of
the
per
curiam
by
the
trial
court.
and,
we
also
wish
to
call
your
honors’
attention
to
the
decision
of
o’conner
versus
ohio
decided
by
your
honors
in
1966,
87
supreme
court
252,
385
us
92,
in
which
case
your
honors
actually
took
jurisdiction
of
a
matter
which
have
not
been
raised
in
the
trial
court
and
held
that,
since
the
defendant
was
not
in
the
position
to
literally
foresee
the
action
which
your
honors
were
going
to
take
in
this
particular
case
--
mr.
nathan
greenberg
yes,
sir.
mr.
nathan
greenberg
yes,
and
we
respect--
mr.
nathan
greenberg
yes,
sir.
we
actually
pinpoint
the
issue
in
the
spencer
dissent
which,
literally,
focused
its
attention
on
it.
we
respectfully
urge
favorable
consideration
of
our
application.
thank
you,
your
honors.
mr.
nathan
greenberg
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
nathan
greenberg.
i’m
an
attorney
from
gretna,
louisiana.
i
represent
the
defendant
in
this
case,
philip
cardinale,
jr.
who
was
the
petitioner
in
this
honorable
court
for
a
petition
for
a
writ
of
certiorari.
the
petitioner
was
convicted
of
the
crime
of
murder
in
plaquemine
parish,
louisiana
and
he
was
sentenced
to
death.
for
his
appeal,
we
originally
perfected
some-14
bills
of
exceptions
which
we
took
to
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
and
we
are
here
before
your
honors
today
on
what
would
probably
amount
to
two
of
the
bills
of
exceptions
which
have
been
combined
together
in
one
the
crux
of
the
issue
before
your
honors
today
is
the
effect
of
testimony
relative
to
prior
offenses
of
the
accused
where
the
accused
has
not
taken
a
stand
in
his
behalf
and
where,
actually,
we
submit
that
the
use
of
the
prior
convictions
in
this
case
was
to
show
nothing
more
than
a
disposition
to
commit
crime
which,
we
submit,
would
violate
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
now,
the
way
this
developed
in
this
matter
was
like
this.
the
accused
turned
himself
in,
in
tucson,
arizona.
and,
while
he
was
in
custody,
he
was
interrogated
by
the
police
there.
now,
this
was
pre-miranda
and
subsequent
escobedo.
so,
the
escobedo
rule
applies.
during
the
course
of
his
custodial
interrogation,
the
petitioner
volunteered
that
he
had
previously
been
convicted
of
an
offense
in
louisiana,
which
offense
was
actually
a
crime
against
nature,
that
after
he
served
his
time
in
new
orleans
parish
prison,
that
he
went
looking
for
the
girl
who
had
charged
him
with
this
crime,
according
to
him,
allegedly
with
a
gun
for
the
purpose
of
killing
her.
now,
he
did
not
find
the
girl.
he
did
not
commit
any
offense
in
connection
with
it,
and
his
statements
relative
to
the
prior
offense
or,
generally,
that
let’s
see--
i’ll
see
if
i
can
read
it.
during
the
course
of
his
custodial
interrogation
in
tucson,
arizona,
he
referred
to
a
prior
conviction
occurring
in
louisiana,
which,
prior
conviction
was
for
a
crime
against
nature
occurring
on
july
12,
1963
and
causing
the
petitioner
to
be
sentenced
to
serve
three
months
in
a
parish
prison
on
march
25,
1964.
petitioner
further
stated,
during
the
course
of
his
custodial
interrogation,
that
after
he
served
his
time
in
new
orleans
parish
prison,
he
went
looking
for
his
alleged
prosecutrix
with
a
gun
for
the
stated
purpose
of
killing
her.
however,
he
never
did
find
her
and,
therefore,
no
further
offense
was
committed.
now,
in
essence,
what
we
have
here
is
a
situation
where
this
reference
to
the
prior
offense
serves
absolutely
no
useful
purpose,
we
respectfully
submit.
the
only
purpose
that
this
link
could
possibly
serve,
we
submit,
is
to
try
to
prejudice
the
jury
to
show
the
jury
that
this
defendant
is
a
bad
man.
this,
of
course,
is
why
we’re
here
before
your
honors
today
because,
here,
we
had
a
situation
where
this
could
very
easily
have
been
separated
from
the
remainder
of
the
statements
of
the
accused.
this
could
very
easily
have
been
excluded,
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
we
sought
to
exclude
it
from
the
time
it
first
came
up.
it
came
up
in
the
opening
statement.
it
came
up
in
the
interrogation
of
the
police
officer.
it
came
up
in
the
closing
argument
by
the
district
attorney.
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
we
sought
to
exclude
at
each
level
of
the
proceedings
or
each
stages
of
proceeding,
it
was
admitted
and
it
was
repeatedly
referred
to
in
the
closing
argument.
mr.
nathan
greenberg
in
the
district
court,
if
your
honor
please,
this
trial
occurred
in
may
of
1966.
this
was
prior
to
the
ruling
of
your
honors
in
the
spencer
case
and,
of
course,
we’ve
picked
up
the
language
of
the
spencer
case
which,
i
believe,
was
in
1967
as
a
basis
of
relying
upon
the
application
for
the
writ
to
this
court
and
the
wording
of
the
dissenting
opinion
by
mr.
chief
justice
warren.
mr.
nathan
greenberg
yes,
sir.
mr.
nathan
greenberg
upon
application
for
the
writ.
mr.
nathan
greenberg
yes.
in
the
trial
court,
what
had
happened
was
that
the
states
ought
to
justify
the
admissibility
of
the
conviction
on
a
basis
of
propensity
or
pattern
and,
of
course,
we
argued
to
the
court
at
this
time
that
there
was
no
pattern
because
the
prior
offense
was
crime
against
nature
and
this,
of
course,
was
murder.
and,
of
course,
the
only
reference
to
the
alleged
looking
for
the
prosecutrix
with
a
gun
and
so
forth
related
to
an
incomplete
offense.
now,
we
did
not
succeed
in
this
respect.
the
state
then
came
in
and
sought
to
justify
the
admissibility
of
the
testimony
on
a
theory
that
this
was
a
part
of
the
entire
confession,
and
the
entire
confession
as
a
whole
must
go
in,
that
louisiana
has
such
a
statute
requiring
this
that
the
entire
confession
go
in.
and,
since
this
defendant
said
this,
regardless
of
what
it
was,
it
must
go
into
evidence.
and,
of
course,
we
respectfully
submit
that
this
should
not
be
so.
for
example,
suppose
the
defendant
made
a
statement
reflecting
upon
character
or
integrity
of
jurors,
for
example.
should
this
go
in
because
it’s
a
part
of
an
alleged
confession?
should
the
prosecution
be
entitled
to
use
this
as
an
attempt
to
prejudice
the
jury
against
the
defendant?
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
issue
in
this
case
is
quite
simple
and
the
issue
is
to
what
extent
the
evidence
of
prior
convictions
should
be
allowed
to
go
in
on
behalf
of
the
prosecution.
mr.
nathan
greenberg
no,
sir,
it
was
not.
mr.
nathan
greenberg
that
is
correct.
mr.
nathan
greenberg
because
of
the
contention
that
the
constitution
was
violated
with
reference
to
the
admissibility
of
the
evidence
per
se,
in
other
words,
the
louisiana
supreme
court
held
that
the
confession
must
be
considered
as
a
whole.
mr.
nathan
greenberg
the
federal
question,
if
your
honor
please,
in
connection
with
this
matter
was
not
raised
in
the
state
court
for
the
reason
that
there
was
no--
in
the
trial
court,
there
was
no
expression
which
actually
hit
this
on
the
button
as
it
did
in
the
dissenting
opinion
in
the
spencer
case
which
came
out
after
this
trial
in
the
state
court.
mr.
nathan
greenberg
no,
sir,
it
was
not.
we
originally--
mr.
nathan
greenberg
no,
sir,
it
did
not.
we
took
the--
mr.
nathan
greenberg
the
issue
as
to
constitutionality
was
not
raised
prior
to
the
time
of
the
preparation
of
the
application
for
the
writ
to
this
court.
mr.
nathan
greenberg
we
submit
that
the
constitutional
issue
is
present,
if
your
honor
please.
this
is
a
question
where
we
have
raised
a
federal
question.
perhaps
the
state
may
not
passed
upon
up
but,
even
though
the
state
may
not
have
passed
upon
it,
it
has
been
raised
in
connection
with
the
application
for
the
writ.
mr.
nathan
greenberg
i
believe
that
i
refer
to
it
at
transcripts,
page
496-510.
mr.
nathan
greenberg
through
510.
mr.
nathan
greenberg
no,
in
the
appendix
we
refer
to
the
bill
of
exceptions,
which,
bill
of
exception
sets
forth
the
actual
reference
to--
as
to
the
manner
in
which
it
was
raised.
the--
in
the
appendix,
i
can
refer
your
honors
to
that.
mr.
nathan
greenberg
yes,
sir,
we
did.
mr.
nathan
greenberg
yes,
sir.
that
is
correct.
we
did
raise
other
issues
relative
to
the
constitutionality
of
various
other
matters
in
the
course
of
the
case,
however,
not
as
to
this
particular--
mr.
nathan
greenberg
now,
i’m
looking
at
the
appendix
here
and,
particularly,
the
bill
of
exceptions
number
3
which
appears
at
page
9,
10,
and
11
of
the
bill--
of
the
appendix,
and
bill
of
exceptions
number
10
which
appears
at
page
12,
13,
and
14.
mr.
nathan
greenberg
this
is--
mr.
nathan
greenberg
correct,
sir.
mr.
nathan
greenberg
this
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
nathan
greenberg
not
in
the
district
court,
no,
sir.
mr.
nathan
greenberg
no,
this
bill
of
exceptions
was
prepared
and
submitted
to
the
trial
judge
and
then--
mr.
nathan
greenberg
these
bills
of
exceptions.
mr.
nathan
greenberg
no,
sir,
not
as
to
bill
of
exceptions
number
3
and
bill
of
exceptions
number
10.
mr.
nathan
greenberg
that
is
correct.
well,
not--
there
were--
permit
me
to
say
this.
we
did
raise
other
federal
constitutional
questions
in
other
bills,
but
this
was
not
the
basis
of
the
application
for
the
writ.
mr.
nathan
greenberg
the
exact
question
which
was
raised
in
the
appellee’s--
mr.
nathan
greenberg
no,
sir,
we
did
not.
mr.
nathan
greenberg
well,
if
your
honor
please,
the
issue
which
we
raised
herein
is
one
which
really
developed
since
the
trial
of
this
case.
this
case
was
concluded,
i
believe,
on
may
5,1966,
and
the
issue
which
was
raised
was
actually
pinpointed
in
your
honors’
decision
of
the
spencer
case
which
was
decided
by
this
honorable
court
in
1967.
and,
insofar
as
the
focusing
of
attention
on
this
issue
was
concerned,
at
that
time,
the
bills
of
exceptions
had
already
been
signed,
the
appeal
had
been
lodged
in
the
state
supreme
court,
and
there
was
no
way
in
which
the
issue
could
be
raised
at
that
time
for
the
very
simple
reason
that,
under
the
state
practice
and
procedure,
we
have
to
raise
the
bills
of
exceptions,
the
basis
of
the
objections
to
the
admissibility
of
the
evidence,
have
them
signed
by
the
trial
court,
and
then
we
take
the
appeal.
so,
there
was
really,
we
submit,
no
way
in
which
we
could
raise
the
issue
at
that
time
because
the
matter
had
already
been
tried,
submitted,
and
the
trial
court
had
lost
jurisdiction.
mr.
nathan
greenberg
yes,
sir,
we
do.
this
is
the
entire
basis
of
the
application
for
the
writ.
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
opinion
in
the
spencer
case,
both
majority
and
dissent,
would
clearly
indicate
that
the
position
of
the
defense
in
this
case
was
correct
that
it
would
be
violative
of
the
due
process
clause.
in
the
spencer
case,
in
the
majority
opinion,
the
majority
stated
petitioners
do
not
even
appear
to
be
arguing
that
the
constitution
is
infringed
if
a
jury
is
told
of
a
defendant’s
prior
crimes.
and
this,
of
course,
is
exactly
what
happened
in
this
particular
case.
the
spencer
case
was
a
habitual
criminal
and
multiple
offender
situation
out
of
texas.
and
of
course,
here,
we
don’t
have
this
case
at
all
because,
here,
we
have
a
situation
where
the
only
thing
which
is
involved
here
is
the
question
of
the
defendant’s
prior
offense
coming
into
evidence
where
a
defendant
has
not
taken
the
stand,
has
not
sought
to
offer
any
character
evidence
or
anything
of
this
type
and
what,
in
essence,
has
occurred
is
that
the
prosecution
says
“well,
since
you,
mr.
defendant,
made
this
statement
during
the
course
of
this
confession,
we
are
entitled
to
bring
it
into
evidence.”
mr.
nathan
greenberg
we
submit
that
this
actually
leaves
our
question
open.
and,
as
was
pointed
out
in
the
dissent,
it
leaves
the
question
open
here
and,
as
was
stated
in
the
dissenting
opinion--
i
have
the
language
quoted
in
the
brief.
“while
this
court
has
never
held
that
the
use
of
prior
convictions
to
show
nothing
more
than
a
disposition
to
commit
crime
would
violate
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
our
decisions
exercising
supervisory
power
over
criminal
trials
in
federal
courts
as
well
as
decisions
by
courts
of
appeal
and
of
state
courts
suggest
that
evidence
of
prior
crimes
introduced
for
no
purpose
other
than
to
show
criminal
disposition
would
violate
the
due
process
clause
and
this,
of
course,
is
exactly
the
situations
which--
mr.
nathan
greenberg
well,
your
honor
is
talking
about
the
propensity
of
pattern-type--
mr.
nathan
greenberg
yes,
sir.
mr.
nathan
greenberg
that’s
correct.
mr.
nathan
greenberg
a
different
woman
here.
mr.
nathan
greenberg
this
was
a
different
woman.
mr.
nathan
greenberg
yes,
sir.
mr.
nathan
greenberg
absolutely,
a
different
woman
at
that
time.
mr.
nathan
greenberg
no,
same
state.
mr.
nathan
greenberg
yes,
sir.
mr.
nathan
greenberg
yes,
sir.
mr.
nathan
greenberg
yes,
sir.
in
other
words,
we
were
placed
in
a
rather
anomalous
position
here
where
the
basis
of
our
application
here
really
occurred
while
this
thing
was
pending,
if
your
honor
please--
if
your
honors
please,
and
we
have
a
situation
where
i
must
admit
in
all
candid
to
the
court
that
the
direct
matter
raised
here
today
was
not
submitted
to
either
the
trial
court
or
the
louisiana
supreme
court.
however,
in
our
research,
we
discovered
the
basis
of
coming
up
here
on
a
federal
question
subsequent
to
the
trial,
subsequent
to
the
time
that
the
bills
of
exceptions
had
been
perfected
and,
of
course,
subsequent
to
the
time
that
the
brief
had
been
prepared
in
louisiana
supreme
court.
mr.
nathan
greenberg
we
don’t
have
any
authorities
to
come
before
your
honor
and
say
“i
know
that
i
can
point
to
such
and
such
a
decision”
and
say
this
is
a
basis
of
it.
mr.
nathan
greenberg
i
do
not.
however,
if
your
honors
want
some
research
on
this,
we
would
be
glad
to
check
the
matter
out
and
submit
a
supplemental
brief
in
connection
with
the
issue.
we
came
up
solely
on
the
basis
of
the
prior
offense
coming
into
evidence
which
we
felt
was
an
unconstitutional
act
on
the
part
of
the
prosecution.
we
raised
it
in
a
different
vein.
there
isn’t
any
question
about
that.
however,
it
really
is
a
question
of
approach.
mr.
nathan
greenberg
well,
in
the
event,
our
rights
of
appeal
would
be
terminated
because
we
came
up
here
in
the
normal
course
of
the
appellant
review.
then,
of
course,
we
would
have
to--
mr.
nathan
greenberg
resort
to
habeas
corpus
in
the
federal
court
system
to
present
the
issue.
in
other
words,
it
would
be
just
like
a
situation
where,
subsequent
to
miranda,
for
example,
a
defendant
was
tried
and
he
didn’t
have
adequate
counsel
and
then
he
came
in
and
sought
to
review
it
by
way
of
habeas
corpus
in
the
federal
court
system.
mr.
nathan
greenberg
the
statute
in
connection
with
the
entirety
of
a
confession?
mr.
nathan
greenberg
we
have
not
researched
this
one
from
a
standpoint
of
other
states,
but
my
recollection
is
that
there
are
some
which
have
a
similar
statute.
mr.
nathan
greenberg
not
in
a
criminal
law
area.
mr.
nathan
greenberg
louisiana
has
a
different
historical
background
from
a
standpoint
of
development
of
the
law
in
the
civil
law
area.
mr.
nathan
greenberg
yes,
sir.
however,
insofar
as
the
law
of
crimes
is
concerned,
it’s
taken
from
the
common
law.
mr.
nathan
greenberg
oh
yes,
sir,
absolutely.
our
civil
law
is
based
upon
the
code
of
napoleon
which,
in
turn,
is
based
upon
the
code
of
justinian.
however,
in
the
law
of
crimes,
our
law
is
taken
directly
from
the
common
law.
it
is,
of
course,
codified
by
statute
today.
we
respectfully
urge
your
honors’
consideration
of
the
issue
which
is
raised
and
which
was--
as
was
pointed
out
and
raised
for
the
first
time
in
this
application
for
a
writ.
we
respectfully
request
the
indulgence
of
the
court
for
additional
time
within
which
to
file
a
supplemental
brief
to
research
the
issue
raised
in
connection
with
the
matter
of
jurisdiction.
it
is,
of
course,
true
that
the
habeas
corpus
remedies
which
are
available
to
petitioner
have
not
been
utilized.
however,
we
felt
that
in
as
much
as
the
time
for
appeal
had
not
yet
run
and
in
as
much
as
the
opportunity
til--
still
presented
itself
for
this
case
to
run
began
through
the
course
of
the
appellate
review,
that
we
should
ask
for
the
application
of
the
writ
of
certiorari,
which
we
did.
and,
of
course,
we
realized
that
we
did
not
raise
this
constitutional
issue
in
the
district
court
or
in
the
supreme
court,
but
the
issues
is,
nevertheless,
existed
in
one
which,
we
submit,
should
warrant
your
honors’
attention
to
the
matter.
we
submit
it
is
a
matter
of
prime
importance.
it’s
a
matter
which
would
have
great
effect
in
connection
with
prosecution
of
criminal
cases,
not
only
in
louisiana
but
in
other
jurisdictions.
what
is
the
effect
of
prior
offenses
where
the
defendant
has
not
taken
the
stand,
has
not
put
the
issue
of
his
character
or
reputation
at
evidence,
and
in
the
course
of
the
confession,
the
defendant
refers
to
the
prior
offense
and
the
prosecution
brings
us
out
as
a
part
of
the
confession
as
a
whole.
we
submit
that
the
evidence
which
was
taken
in
this
case
would
warrant
your
honors’
taking
cognizance
of
the
matter
and
reversing
it.
mr.
nathan
greenberg
well,
there
isn’t
any
doubt
in
my
mind,
but
that
this
was
the
intent
of
the
statute.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
we
have
cited
the
statute
in
the
brief
and,
of
course,
here
one
phase
of
the
statute
is
used
against
us,
and
this
is
the
statute.
every
confession,
admission,
or
declaration
sought
to
be
used
against
anyone
must
be
used
in
its
entirety
so
that
the
person
to
be
affected
thereby
may
have
the
benefit
of
any
exculpation
or
explanation
that
the
whole
statement
may
afford.
so,
actually,
the
exculpatory
proviso
of
the
statute
is
one
which
really
requires
the
utilization
of
the
confession
as
a
whole
and,
here,
the
confession
as
a
whole
is
being
used
to
show
that
the
defendant
is
a
bad
man.
mr.
nathan
greenberg
no,
sir,
it
was
not.
it
was
an
oral
confession.
mr.
nathan
greenberg
yes.
mr.
nathan
greenberg
that
is
correct.
we
respectfully
request
your
honors’
favorable
consideration
of
this
matter.
should
the
court
require
or
wish
supplemental
briefs
on
the
issue
of
jurisdiction,
if
your
honors
would
fix
some
additional
time
within
which
this
matter
can
be
raised,
we
submitted
that
the
matter
that
we
had
jurisdiction
under
the
statutory
provisions
raised.
mr.
nathan
greenberg
yes,
sir,
he
is.
he’s
on
death
row
in
angola
state.
mr.
nathan
greenberg
yes,
sir.
mr.
nathan
greenberg
yes,
sir.
mr.
nathan
greenberg
yes,
sir,
we
do.
mr.
nathan
greenberg
may
i
just
state
this
to
the
court,
if
your
honor
please.
i
note
my
time
is
running
out.
in
as
much
as
a
right
to
review
had
not
been
lost
because
of
the
laps
of
time,
we
sought
to
come
up
by
way
of
application
for
the
writ
of
certiorari
and
we
want
to
make
this
abundantly
clear
to
your
honors
that
we
thought
that
we
should
appeal
in
this
fashion
rather
than
go
to
the--
mr.
nathan
greenberg
oh,
yes.
mr.
nathan
greenberg
absolutely,
sir.
mr.
nathan
greenberg
yes,
sir.
mr.
nathan
greenberg
no,
sir,
not
those.
mr.
nathan
greenberg
that’s
correct.
we
reserved
bills
of
exceptions
in
connection
with
this
matter,
but
it
was
on
a
state
statute.
mr.
nathan
greenberg
that’s
correct.
mr.
nathan
greenberg
no.
mr.
nathan
greenberg
well,
i
was
hopefully
--
mr.
nathan
greenberg
well,
we
felt
that
we
should
try
this
anyway
because
the
delays
have
not
expired.
mr.
nathan
greenberg
we
thank
you
for
your
consideration.
mr.
nathan
greenberg
yes,
sir,
he
had.
mr.
nathan
greenberg
yes,
sir.
mr.
nathan
greenberg
may
it
please
the
court.
i
merely
would
like
to
call
two
matters
to
the
court’s
attention.
at
page
4
and
5
of
the
appendix,
we
set
forth
the
chronology
of
events
and,
in
the
bottom
of
page
4,
it
indicates
that
the
case
was
concluded
friday,
may
6,
that
the
defendant
--
of
1966,
the
defendant
was
sentenced
to
death
on
july
19,
1966.
and,
on
october
6,
1966,
the
per
curiam
on
the
bill
of
exceptions
were
signed
by
the
trial
court.
now,
under
louisiana
law,
the
rule
which
was
in
existence
at
that
time
was
that,
upon
signing
of
the
bill
of
exceptions,
a
trial
court
is
divested
of
jurisdiction
and
any
bills
filed
thereafter
and
presented
to
the
judge
for
his
signature
in
per
curiam
come
too
late
and
cannot
be
considered
on
appeal.
and,
this
is
the
decision
of
state
versus
harrell,
228
louisiana
434,
82
southern
2nd
701.
now
--
mr.
nathan
greenberg
yes,
sir,
absolutely.
now,
the
law
has
since
been
changed
in
louisiana.
we
now
have
a
new
code
of
criminal
procedure.
however,
this
case
was
tried
prior
to
the
effective
date
of
the
code
of
criminal
procedure.
spencer
versus
the
state
of
texas,
which
focused
attention
on
the
issue
raised
herein,
was
decided
--
or
it
was
rather
argued
on
october
17
and
8,
1966
and
was
decided
january
23,
1967
which,
of
course,
was
subsequent
to
the
taking
of
the
appeal,
the
filing
of
the
bills
of
exceptions,
and
the
rendition
of
the
per
curiam
by
the
trial
court.
and,
we
also
wish
to
call
your
honors’
attention
to
the
decision
of
o’conner
versus
ohio
decided
by
your
honors
in
1966,
87
supreme
court
252,
385
us
92,
in
which
case
your
honors
actually
took
jurisdiction
of
a
matter
which
have
not
been
raised
in
the
trial
court
and
held
that,
since
the
defendant
was
not
in
the
position
to
literally
foresee
the
action
which
your
honors
were
going
to
take
in
this
particular
case
--
mr.
nathan
greenberg
yes,
sir.
mr.
nathan
greenberg
yes,
and
we
respect--
mr.
nathan
greenberg
yes,
sir.
we
actually
pinpoint
the
issue
in
the
spencer
dissent
which,
literally,
focused
its
attention
on
it.
we
respectfully
urge
favorable
consideration
of
our
application.
thank
you,
your
honors.
