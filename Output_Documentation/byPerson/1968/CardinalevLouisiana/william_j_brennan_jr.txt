justice
william
j.
brennan,

well--
but
when
you
got
to
the
state
supreme
court,
the
error
was
not
assigned
and
the
bill
of
exceptions
isn’t
constitutional
error,
was
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
supreme
court
opinion
did
not
treat
it
on
the
ground
of
constitutional
error,
did
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then,
how--
what
is
the
answer
to
justice
white’s
question?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
do
we
have
any
jurisdiction
to
go
through
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
was
cited
in
the
jurisdiction.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and,
what’s
your
ground?
i
gather,
the
fourth
and
fifth
amendment
questions
that
you
raised,
weren’t
they?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather
this
is
neither.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
would
say--
you
mean,
that
spencer
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
available
at
the
time
of
argument.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and,
spencer
was
not
relied
on--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
either
in
brief
or
in
oral?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
but
after
the
statute,
what
it
says
is
it
has
to
be
a
confession,
an
admission,
or
a
declaration,
and
it
has
to
be
something
that
the
prosecutor
intends
to
use.
and,
i
gather,
the
supreme
court
--
your
supreme
court
have
said
here,
in
any
event,
that
this
was,
i
don’t
know
whether
it’s
a
confession,
admission,
or
a
declaration
but
in
any
event,
it’s
obtained
within
the
four
corners
of
the
statute.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that’s
what
your
court
has
said.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
suppose
we’re
concluded
by
that
so
far
as
this
testimony
of
the
tucson
officer
is
concerned,
aren’t
we?
that's
your
--
the
statute
covers
it,
right?
