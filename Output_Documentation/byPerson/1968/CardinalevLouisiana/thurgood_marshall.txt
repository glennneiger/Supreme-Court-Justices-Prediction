justice
thurgood
marshall
but
it

says
you

justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
in
no
place
did
you

that
you
object
on

grounds
that

violates
any
provision

and
i
don’t
see
the
us
constitution
anywhere.
justice

from

justice
thurgood
marshall

thurgood
marshall
well,
my
answer
was

justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you

don’t
have
any
authority
to
afford
this.
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
i
mean,
you

have
the
authority
to
say
that
you
can
raised
in
this
court,
for
the
first
time,
a
federal
question
that
was
not
raised
nor
decided
nor--
not
raised,
submitted,
nor
decided
by
the
state
court.
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
did
you
make
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and

you
agree
with
the
type
of
petition

for
the
protection
of
the
defendant?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,

--
justice
thurgood
marshall

final
question
is,
did
it
help
him?
justice
thurgood
marshall

i
--
didn’t
this
testimony
help
the
defendant?
justice
thurgood
marshall

you
weren’t
helping
him,
were
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
were
giving
the
jury
--
the
theory
that
this
man
was
the
type
of
man
who
went
around
murdering
women.
justice
thurgood
marshall

that
what
you

what
you
