mr.
preston
h.
hufft
oh,
no
it’s--
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
no,
sir.
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
if
your
honor
please,
i
represent
the
state
in
this
matter.
before
starting
out,
i’d
like
to
point
just
one
brief
comment
with
respect
to
spencer.
spencer
was
decided
in
january
23,
1967.
we
argued
this
case
before
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
in
december
1967
and
the
opinion
was
handed
down
in
january
15,
1968,
almost
a
year
after
spencer.
now,
just
to
review
when
--
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
spencer
was
--
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
almost
been
for
a
year
when
we
argued
the
case
before
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana.
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
no,
sir.
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
spencer
was
not
relied
on.
the
only
constitutional
issues
raised,
federal
questions
raised
in
the
state
proceedings
was
one
on
the
question
of
the
search
warrants
by
the
que--
of
evidence
and
this
supreme
court
that
just
decided
the
warden
case
which
was
in
point,
and
the
state
supreme
court
used
that
and
disposed
of
the
question
of
the
search
warrants.
he
also
raised
the
question
with
respect
to
miranda
that
this
case
was
instituted
prior
to
miranda,
and
the
supreme
court
of
our
state
made
note
of
the
fact
that
the
johnson
case
would
apply
since
we
got
started
before
hand
and,
also,
took
special
note,
as
we
had
also
briefed,
that
even
if
this
case
had
started
after
miranda,
this
case
met
the
test
of
miranda.
i
know
that
to
really
picture
that
the
images
go
into
the
facts
so
we’ll
see
exactly
what
we’re
dealing
with
here.
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
sir?
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
i
don’t
recall,
sir.
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
yes,
well
they
were--
it’s
one
of
the
cases
that--
it’s
a
california
case
about
the
drunken
driver.
they
did
cite
it,
sir,
in
their
opinion.
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
right,
sir.
that,
of
course,
the
warden
case
came
in
and
we
decided
on
the
warden
case
to
eliminate
all
questions.
that
was
one
of
the
cases
cited,
but
the
warden
case
was
compelling
because
we
were--
they
objected
to
the
fact
that
we
had
issued
search
warrants
in
order
to
search
for
evidence,
and
we
raised
the
gouled
case
and
the
warden
case
came
out
directly
on
point
and
we
had
no
trouble
whatsoever,
at
least
our
state
court
didn’t,
disposing
of
that
question.
now,
these
are
the
facts
of
the
case.
this
man
lived
in
marrero,
louisiana
which
is
a
parish
in
jefferson,
right
across
the
river
from
louisia--
i
mean,
new
orleans.
plaquemine
parish
adjoins
jefferson
parish
and
also,
in
a
little
tip,
adjoins
new
orleans
parish.
this
man
came
across
the
river
from
jefferson
parish,
went
into
the
downtown
area
of
new
orleans,
picked
up
this
girl
in
a
bar,
had--
this
is
the
victim
i’m
talking
about
now,
had
several
drinks
with
her,
went
from
place
to
place.
during
the
course
of
the
night,
one
witness
identified
that
the
man,
the
defendant,
had
stopped
in
for
gas
and
then
sped
off
and
he
heard
the
scream
of
a
woman
in
the
car
that
helped
her
out.
she
was
being
held
in
the
trunk.
it
then
develops
that
the
defendant
was--
admits
being
at
the
scene.
he
admits
the
fact
that
he
had
blood
on
his
hand,
his
car,
his
clothes,
and
the
scene
at
which
we
found
the
victim.
he
rode
around
town
that
night,
finally
fled
the
state
of
louisiana,
and
we
issued
a
warrant
for
his
arrest.
based
on
the
information,
the
people
who
had
seen
them
together
at
the
bars
and
the
nightclubs,
the
service
attendant
who
recognized
him,
recognized
his
car,
and
so
forth
and
so
on.
he
fled
to
finally
wound
up
in
the
state
of
arizona
in
tucson.
one
night,
just
walking
down
the
street
in
tucson,
he
flagged
two
policemen
and
said
“take
me
in,
i’ve
committed
a
crime.”
they
said,
“wait
a
minute,
let
us
give
you
your
rights”
and
they
gave
the
man
his
rights
under
escobedo.
“in
fact,
you
don’t
have
to
say
anything
you
say
it,
it
can
be
used
against
you
and
you
have
a
right
to
contact
an
attorney,”
and
they
took
the
man
in.
the
man
then
still
didn’t
know
what
his
choice,
well
at
least
the
police
didn’t.
the
police
had
a
difficult
time
to
verify
the
choice
because
the
man
said
that
he
had
committed
a
crime
in
new
orleans
parish.
well,
not
knowing
to
him,
he
had
just
crossed
the
line
and
had
murdered
the
girl
in
plaquemine
parish.
so,
the
police
in
tucson
didn’t’
really
had
the
opportunity
to
either
check
his
stories
and
see
why
he
was
wanted.
now,
in
tucson,
talking
to
these
policemen,
in
which,
our
state
court,
and
the
trial
court
also,
said
it
was
a
very
relaxed
conversation.
he
was
a
man
who
wanted
to
get
something
off
of
his
chest.
he’s
a
man
who
flagged
the
policeman
down,
the
man
who
wanted
to
talk
about
something
that
had
occurred,
to
talk
to
the
policeman
who
knew
nothing
about
it.
and,
our
court
and
the
state
supreme
court
ruled,
of
course,
the
johnson
case
was
applicable
where
they
said
even
in
the--
over
and
above
the
johnson
case,
they
felt
this
confession
met
that
comment
in
the
miranda
case,
that
you
don’t
have
to
stop
a
man
when
he
walks
to
the
police
and
flags
you
down
and
wants
to
get
something
off
of
his
chest.
so,
in
this
writ,
there’s
no
issue
raised
whatsoever
as
to
the
voluntary
nature
of
this
confession
and
this
confession
meets
all
the
tests
of
being
voluntary.
the
only
issue
arises
are
the
following
testimony
in
which
this
police
officer
from
tucson
gave
the
defendant’s
confession.
included
in
that
confession,
was
this
comment
and
i’ll
read
it
for
the
court.
this
is
the
police
officer
talking.
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
that’s--
i’m
not
in
the
appendix.
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
this
is
on
page
5
of
my
brief,
sir.
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
“yes,
he
did.
he
told
me
that,
several
months
prior
to
this
taking
place,
he
picked
up
a
woman
whom
he
described
is
a
prostitute
downtown
in
new
orleans.”
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
they
asked
him
if
wel--
weather
or
not
he
had
walked
in
this--
i’ll
just
put
it
this
way
now.
during
the
course
of
his
relating
the
confession,
when
the
police
officer
arrived
at
the
point
in
which
he
was
then
going
to
relate
this
comment
relative
to
the
previous
incident,
the
defense
objected
and
has
a
long
protracted
argument.
and,
after
the
court
had
ruled
that
this
was
admissible
on
the
basis
that
it
was
part
of
the
confession
and
under
the
state
statute,
it--
the
confession
had
to
be
used
in
its
entirety
and
this
was
admissible.
so,
this
picks
up
right
after
the
argument
in
the
decision
of
the
trial
judge
that
that
question
was
admissible.
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
there
may
have
been.
if
i
please--
i’m
not
quite
certain.
i
believe
there
was
a
particular
question
because
it
has
been
raised
at--
earlier
in
the
preliminary
statement,
in
order
to
introduce
the
profession,
it
had
been
mentioned
in
the
preliminary
statement
and
an
argument
had
ensued
on
that
basis.
this
statement
had
been
mentioned
when
the
judge
took
under
the
questions
whether
or
not
the
confession
was
voluntary,
and
this
comes
now
for
the
first
time
that
the
jury
has
heard
this
actual
testimony
and
i
would
imagine
to
say
it
was
in
the
form
of
a
question,
knowing
the
stopping,
so
as
to
make
certain
that
all
the
arguments
are
presented
thereto.
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
well,
sir,
we
did
this--
we--
in
the
introduction
of
this
evidence,
we
go
on
a--
went
on
a
two-pronged
attack
in
so
far
as
the
introduction.
number
one,
we
said
under
the
state
statute,
title
15450,
it
says
that
if
you
use
a
confession,
the
confession
must
be
used
in
its
entirety.
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
well,
i’ll
say
this.
this
is
a
state
statute
which
does
not
give
the
district
attorney
any
discretion
for
him
to
say
what
he
shall
put
in,
what
he
shall
not
put
in.
this
is
meant
for
the
protection
of
the
defendant,
yes,
sir.
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
it's
meant
--
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
there
is
no
provision
to
waive
that
protection.
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
the
--
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
he
objected,
yes,
sir.
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
i
suppose
he
could
go
toward
waiving
it,
yes,
sir,
but
the
state
statute
--
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
the
waive
--
objection?
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
no,
sir.
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
no,
sir.
well,
i’m
trying
to
get
over
this
point,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
no,
sir.
i
say
this
--
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
well,
mr.
justice,
i’ll
say
this.
we
had
two
bases
upon
which
we
said
this
testimony
was
admissible.
were
very
strong
then
and
very
strong
now.
this
testimony
was
admissible
because
the
law
said
in
the
state
of
louisiana
that,
to
use
the
confession,
you’ve
got
to
use
the
confession
in
its
entirety.
secondly,
and
we
argued
very
strenuously
and
still
do
here,
that
this
testimony
was
appropriate,
was
admissible
because
it
intended
to
show
motive
and
intent.
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
this
was
one
of
those
instances
--
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
that’s
what
i
--
when
you
look
at
the
circumstances--
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
well,
again,
the
circumstance
is
so.
when
you
read
his
statement
in
which
he
says
exactly
what
took
place
in
this
prior
incident,
what
took
place
in
a
crime
in
which
we’ve
charged
him,
they’re
almost
identical
incidents.
and,
we
show
that
this
man,
on
the
basis
that
someone
would
complain
against
him,
and
these
are
his
very
words
i’m
going
to
read
you,
“would
take
a
gun
and
kill
that
person
for
having
complained
against
him.”
and,
we
say
that’s
essential.
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
sir,
we
had
two
bases.
the
statute
said
we
had
to
do
it
and
we
also
say
it’s
admissible.
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
now,
this
is
the
man’s
statement,
if
i
get
back
to
it.
“yes,
he
did.
he
told
me
that,
several
months
prior
to
this
taking
place,
he
picked
up
a
woman
whom
he
described
as
a
prostitute
downtown
in
new
orleans,
that
after
having
several
drinks
together,
they
had
intercourse
and
then,
in
his
statement
in
his
own
words,
she
went
down
on
me.
he
then
said
that
an
argument--
that
after
an
argument
that
she
slapped
him
and
he
backed-hand
her.
then,
he
said
that,
a
while
later,
she
signed
a
complaint
against
him
for
backhanding
her
and
that
he
received
the
sentence
of
90
days.
of
which,
he
did
45.
he
said
that,
immediately
after
getting
out
of
jail
from
doing
the
45
days,
that
he
went
out
and
got
a
gun
and
looked
for
two
or
three
nights
for
her
downtown
in
the
area
where
he
had
first
seen
her
with
the
intention
of
killing
her
because
she
had
signed
a
complaint
against
him.”
present
case,
the
facts
almost
identical
because
we
have
no
witness
to
say
what
really
happened
in
that
argument
view
because
this
victim
we
have
wasn’t
quite
as
fortunate
as
the
first
woman.
he
didn’t
find
her.
the
victim
we
have
in
the
second
question
was
murdered.
now,
that
was
the
--
this
is
the
entire
statement.
that
--
what
i
just
read
is
the
entire
statement
the
jury
heard
with
reference
to
this.
we
say
that,
under
our
statute,
we
had
no
alternative.
we
had
to
produce
he’s
statement
in
its
entirety.
so,
where
the
lower
court
ruled,
that’s
the
way
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
ruled
in
a
long
line
of
decisions.
now,
we
don’t
--
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
yes,
sir,
i
would
for
this
reason,
and
this
is
--
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
this
--
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
this
we
did
do
in
our
office
--
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
in
our
area,
yes,
sir,
for
this
reason.
this
statute
was
intended
that
this
man
would
have
the
benefit
of
having
the
jury
hear
his
confession
in
the
same
way
he
gave
it.
now,
whatever
he
may
consider
to
be
irrelevant
or
not,
a
juror
may
attest
a
certain
way,
too,
and
one
of
the
reasons
for
putting
this
statute
in
was
not
to
give
me,
as
a
prosecutor,
the
opportunity
to
ser
--
determine
what
i
should
withhold,
what
i
should
keep
in
the
background
or
having
it
with
a
conference
between
myself
and
the
defense
hits
it,
you’ve
got
to
tell
the
jury
everything
just
like
the
man
told
it
to
you.
you’ve
got
to
relay
all
the
instances
and
let
the
jury
draw
their
own
conclusions
with
respect
to
this
individual’s
testi
--
confession,
and
that’s
what
was
done
--
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
well,
you
see,
if
your
honor
--
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
if
the
chief
justice
would
please,
this
is
not
that
kind
of
a
case.
this
is
a
case
in
tucson
where
the
man
was
walking,
in
which
they
have
no
background
whatsoever
on
the
man,
no
opportunity
whatsoever
to
--
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
this
is
background
to
this
third
lie.
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
yes,
but
this
is
not
a
question
for
them
to
ask
him
questions
concerning
this.
this
is
something
the
man
volunteered,
came
up
with
his
own
free
will,
talking
to
people
who
had
no
opportunity
even
to
search
back
to
the
term
in
what
they
were
considering.
it’s
an
entirely
different
situation,
and
that
question
did
not
arise
in
this
particular
instance.
now,
we
say
this
information
was
essential
over
and
above
the
statute,
and
we
call
--
we
contend
in
our
brief
that
he
has
no
comfort
whatsoever
in
spencer.
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
correct,
sir.
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
no,
sir,
there’s
no
distinction.
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
there
is
no
distinction
made
in
the
jurisprudence
of
the
state.
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
yes,
as
i
said
before,
if
your
honor
please,
they
had
given
the
background
when
this
was
mentioned
in
the
old
case
in
which
we
had
to
mention,
in
order
to
have
it,
appear
in
the
trial
and
use
it.
when
it
was
mentioned
that
it
was
considerable
argument
as
to
whether
or
not
this
police
officer
could
state
this
part
of
the
confession,
when
the
confession
was
heard
by
the
trial
judge
as
to
whether
or
not
it
was
voluntary,
argument
ensued
on
this
particular
point.
when
the
thing
was
founded
presented
to
the
jury,
the
trial
judge
had
ruled.
it
went
on
into
the
confession
and
then
came
this
point,
and
it
came
at
this
point
with
the
question
where
it
was
stopped
on
the
basis
that
defendant,
again,
raised
their
objection
when
it
was
being
presented
to
the
jury
--
the
presence
of
the
jury.
he
objected
three
times.
and,
it
was
in
the
course
knowing
when
these
objections
were
coming
out
and
affording
the
defendant
the
opportunity
--
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
to
go
ahead
and
object.
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
well,
the
theory
behind
this
particular
statute,
as
i
view
it,
sir,
is
the
fact
that
they
don’t
give
me,
as
a
prosecutor,
the
discretion
to
say
what
i
should
or
should
not
put
in.
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
no,
sir,
it
--
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
correct,
sir,
it’s
part
of
--
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
correct,
sir,
that’s
what
the
statute
says
and
that’s
the
way
--
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
of
course,
if
your
honor
please,
he
doesn’t
have
to
say
every
word,
but
of
course
he
has
to
give
the
--
a
substance
under
the
jurisprudence
but
he
cannot
leave
out
items
such
as
that
that
he
figures
to
be
irrelevant
under
the
state
statute.
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
correct,
sir.
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
yes,
sir.
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
yes,
sir.
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
our
state
court,
if
your
honor
please,
considered
it
under
title
15.
this
statute
--
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
and
also,
we
have
two
other
statutes
which
we’ve
mentioned
with
respect
to
the
admissibility
of
previous
offenses
when
they
tend
to
show
motive,
mode
of
operation,
guilty,
knowledge,
and
so
forth
and
so
on
--
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
within
the
traditional
cases
that
this
court
has
recognized.
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
no,
sir,
the
trial
court
ruled
that
it
had
to
come
in
on
the
basis
that
it
was
part
of
the
confession,
and
our
state
supreme
court
did
not
go.
but
we
briefed
both
issues,
but
the
state
supreme
court
arrived
at
one
issue
and
said
“this
is
determinative,”
and
didn’t
reach
the
other
question.
but,
we’ve
raised
them
both
times.
we
argue
both
of
them
here
on
the
very
same
basis.
we
--
quickly
winding
up
when
one
--
also,
the
question
of
spencer,
we
say,
does
not
give
any
hope
or
encouragement
with
respect
to
the
peti
--
position
of
the
defendant.
spencer
would
not
entitle
him
to
set
the
statute
aside.
he
may
have
a
different
opinion
as
to
what
it
should
be,
but
the
statute
says
that
is
what
the
--
we
should
do.
it’s
a
rule
of
evidence
in
the
state
of
louisiana
ans
on
the
books
for
many,
many
years
--
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
it’s
been
on
the
books
for
many,
many
years.
we
think
it’s
an
essential
part.
it
is
not
violative
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
he
relies
on
the
gentle
fairness
approach,
such
as
they
did
in
spencer.
this
is
not
a
berget
case
where
he
has
a
denial
of
a
specific
federal
right.
there
is
no
specific
federal
right
involved
here.
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
thank
you,
sir.
that
the
spencer
case
applicable
in
this
instance
would
uphold
this
statute
of
the
state
of
louisiana,
and
i
refer
to
this
particular
language
in
the
statute
that
it
would
be
wholly
unjustified,
encroached
by
this
court
upon
the
constitutional
powers
of
the
states
to
promulgate
their
own
rules
of
evidence
to
try
their
own
state
created
crimes
in
their
own
state
courts.
i
also
point
out
that
the
berget
case
was
--
this
court
decided
after
the
spencer
decision,
i
take
no
issue
with
that
case
either.
the
berget
case
found
that
there
was
a
specific
federal
constitutional
right
involved.
the
question
of
this
defendant
had
been
denied
the
right
of
counsel
in
one
of
his
state
prosecutions,
and
that
this
court
wasn’t
going
to
allow
error
to
be
piled
on
top
of
an
error
and
allow
him
to
be
denied
it
at
a
second
time
and,
rightfully
so,
in
the
berget
case.
we
also
take
the
position
that
even
under
the
minority
decision
in
the
spencer
case,
that
this
evidence
which
we
introduced
meets
the
test
that
this
court
was
talking
about
in
all
of
its
decisions.
this
information
was
essential.
this
--
under
the
state
law
in
which
this
man
was
being
prosecuted,
he
was
charged
with
murder.
under
our
state
code,
murder
is
the
killing
of
a
human
being
when
the
offender
has
a
specific
intent
to
kill
or
to
inflict
great
bodily
harm.
in
furtherance
of
carrying
out
our
responsibility
to
prove
intent
as
a
necessary
ingredient
of
the
crime
of
murder,
this
evidence
was
inadmissible.
i’ve
cited
several
state
cases
directly
on
point
in
which
they
deal
with
the
question
that
when
intent
is
a
necessary
ingredient
of
the
crime
charged,
it’s
something
which
goes
to
the
determination
of
the
issue
directly
before
the
jury
with
respect
to
intent,
that
it
is
admissible
in
a
long
list
of
cases
in
our
jurisprudence,
and
those
cases
have
also
been
recognized
by
this
court
that
they
are
exceptions
to
that
general
rule.
we
say
we
fall
under
it,
number
one,
because
it’s
our
statute.
it
would
not
be
within
the
providence
of
this
court
to
rewrite
that
statute
under
spencer.
secondly,
even
if
this
court
were
to
say
that
that
statute
would
be
unconstitutional,
we
say
that
this
evidence
is
admissible.
on
the
other
decisions
of
this
court
and
other
state
court,
on
the
basis
that
we
were
showing
motive
and
intent,
and
when
you
look
at
the
brief
--
in
my
brief,
if
your
honors
please,
on
page
18,
i’ve
laid
side-by-side
the
facts
in
this
case
in
which
we
charge
this
man
with
murder
and
the
facts
of
the
previous
incident.
he’s
come
across
the
river,
the
same
area
of
town,
picks
up
a
girl
in
the
same
area,
has
drinks
with
her,
commits
certain
acts,
one
winds
up
where
she
complains,
he
gets
a
gun
and
goes
out
with
intent
to
kill
her
because
she
complained
of
his
conduct.
and,
we
say
the
second
girl
wasn’t
quite
so
lucky.
she
was
killed
before
she
could
complain.
now,
we
say
this
draws
a
definite
parallel
and
this
is
essential
information.
it
was
information
that
the
state
was
required
to
put
in,
in
order
to
prove
intent
and
we
carried
our
responsibility
with
respect
thereto.
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
yes,
sir,
that’s
our
position.
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
yes,
sir.
the
statute
which
says
the
entire
confession
must
be
used
in
its
entirety.
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
yes,
sir.
long
line
of
decisions.
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
yes,
it’s
a
general
rule
with
respect
to
any
--
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
right,
sir.
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
yes,
if
it’s
part
of
the
confession,
it
has
to
be
introduced.
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
well,
yes,
sir.
the
--
they
start
up
with
mani
case.
in
fact,
the
evidence
case
which
was
decided
by
our
state
supreme
court
just
prior
to
this
case,
came
up
to
this
court
and
which
were
refused,
involving
the
very
same
principles
under
444
and
446
on
the
intent
and
also
under
the
use
of
this
statute.
like
i
said,
i
didn’t
brief
the
question
about
whether
the
case
should
be
here.
i
didn’t
believe
it
should
be,
but
i
just
took
the
position
that
you
had
granted
it
and
i
was
--
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
no,
sir.
it
did
not.
i
--
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
my
brief
says
--
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
no,
sir.
what
i’m
doing,
sir,
is
really
answering
that
which
he
has
inserted
in
his
application
in
which
the
application
was
granted.
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
no,
sir.
i
don’t
believe
it
has
jurisdiction,
sir.
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
yes,
sir.
i
don’t
believe
it
has
jurisdiction.
i
didn’t
then
and
i
didn’t
brief
it
on
the
basis
that
the
writs
will
be
in
the
--
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
yes,
sir,
and
i
just
then
--
in
my
brief,
i’ve
concerned
myself
with
answering
the
georgia’s
--
and
i
say,
even
if
you
had
jurisdiction,
i
say
we
answer
all
of
his
charges.i’ll
make
just
one
quick
closing
comment,
if
your
honors
please.
isthat
there
was
some
reference
--
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
i
use
the
same
reasoning
with
perspective
that
as
i
did
with
the
other
ones,
with
my
brief
in
this,
sir.
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
i
say
my
reasoning
then
was
the
same
as
in
that
instance.
i
presumed
on
the
basis
when
you
--
when
i
was
asked
or
a
brief
on
response
to
the
points,
raised
by
him
that
the
other
question
was
already
resolved.
now
that’s
my
--
in
that
respect.
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
well,
all
i
say
is
that’s
the
conclusion
i
reached,
and
that’s
why
it’s
not
mentioned
in
there,
if
your
honor
please.
i
make
this
argument
when
we
mentioned
witherspoon
before.
i
mentioned
it
here
because
some
question
was
raised
as
to
whether
or
not
a
state
had
shifted
its
position
in
a
question
raised
about
fairness.
i
know
the
--
in
the
berget
place,
we
were
--
the
court
says
we
are
not
be
concerned
with
the
question
of
good
faith,
but
i
wanted
to
bring
up
one
thing
with
witherspoon.
we
have
met
the
requirements
of
witherspoon
in
this
very
case
which
was
long
before
this
court
decided
witherspoon.
we
have
a
statute
similar
to
illinois
and
louisiana.
we
had
a
man
who
said
he
was
opposed
to
capital
punishment.
we
questioned
the
man
until
he
finally
reached
the
point
when
he
said
“well,
i
couldn’t,
under
any
circumstances,”
and
we
allowed
that
man
go
and
we
did
not
charge
him,
and
such
a
juror
did
serve
in
this
case.
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
no,
sir.
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
correct
sir.
i
understand.
i
mentioned
that
only
in
question
with
basis
of
good
faith
as
the
situation
goes.
i
have
no
further
questions.
thank
you,
your
honors.
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
oh,
no
it’s--
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
no,
sir.
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
if
your
honor
please,
i
represent
the
state
in
this
matter.
before
starting
out,
i’d
like
to
point
just
one
brief
comment
with
respect
to
spencer.
spencer
was
decided
in
january
23,
1967.
we
argued
this
case
before
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
in
december
1967
and
the
opinion
was
handed
down
in
january
15,
1968,
almost
a
year
after
spencer.
now,
just
to
review
when
--
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
spencer
was
--
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
almost
been
for
a
year
when
we
argued
the
case
before
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana.
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
no,
sir.
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
spencer
was
not
relied
on.
the
only
constitutional
issues
raised,
federal
questions
raised
in
the
state
proceedings
was
one
on
the
question
of
the
search
warrants
by
the
que--
of
evidence
and
this
supreme
court
that
just
decided
the
warden
case
which
was
in
point,
and
the
state
supreme
court
used
that
and
disposed
of
the
question
of
the
search
warrants.
he
also
raised
the
question
with
respect
to
miranda
that
this
case
was
instituted
prior
to
miranda,
and
the
supreme
court
of
our
state
made
note
of
the
fact
that
the
johnson
case
would
apply
since
we
got
started
before
hand
and,
also,
took
special
note,
as
we
had
also
briefed,
that
even
if
this
case
had
started
after
miranda,
this
case
met
the
test
of
miranda.
i
know
that
to
really
picture
that
the
images
go
into
the
facts
so
we’ll
see
exactly
what
we’re
dealing
with
here.
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
sir?
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
i
don’t
recall,
sir.
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
yes,
well
they
were--
it’s
one
of
the
cases
that--
it’s
a
california
case
about
the
drunken
driver.
they
did
cite
it,
sir,
in
their
opinion.
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
right,
sir.
that,
of
course,
the
warden
case
came
in
and
we
decided
on
the
warden
case
to
eliminate
all
questions.
that
was
one
of
the
cases
cited,
but
the
warden
case
was
compelling
because
we
were--
they
objected
to
the
fact
that
we
had
issued
search
warrants
in
order
to
search
for
evidence,
and
we
raised
the
gouled
case
and
the
warden
case
came
out
directly
on
point
and
we
had
no
trouble
whatsoever,
at
least
our
state
court
didn’t,
disposing
of
that
question.
now,
these
are
the
facts
of
the
case.
this
man
lived
in
marrero,
louisiana
which
is
a
parish
in
jefferson,
right
across
the
river
from
louisia--
i
mean,
new
orleans.
plaquemine
parish
adjoins
jefferson
parish
and
also,
in
a
little
tip,
adjoins
new
orleans
parish.
this
man
came
across
the
river
from
jefferson
parish,
went
into
the
downtown
area
of
new
orleans,
picked
up
this
girl
in
a
bar,
had--
this
is
the
victim
i’m
talking
about
now,
had
several
drinks
with
her,
went
from
place
to
place.
during
the
course
of
the
night,
one
witness
identified
that
the
man,
the
defendant,
had
stopped
in
for
gas
and
then
sped
off
and
he
heard
the
scream
of
a
woman
in
the
car
that
helped
her
out.
she
was
being
held
in
the
trunk.
it
then
develops
that
the
defendant
was--
admits
being
at
the
scene.
he
admits
the
fact
that
he
had
blood
on
his
hand,
his
car,
his
clothes,
and
the
scene
at
which
we
found
the
victim.
he
rode
around
town
that
night,
finally
fled
the
state
of
louisiana,
and
we
issued
a
warrant
for
his
arrest.
based
on
the
information,
the
people
who
had
seen
them
together
at
the
bars
and
the
nightclubs,
the
service
attendant
who
recognized
him,
recognized
his
car,
and
so
forth
and
so
on.
he
fled
to
finally
wound
up
in
the
state
of
arizona
in
tucson.
one
night,
just
walking
down
the
street
in
tucson,
he
flagged
two
policemen
and
said
“take
me
in,
i’ve
committed
a
crime.”
they
said,
“wait
a
minute,
let
us
give
you
your
rights”
and
they
gave
the
man
his
rights
under
escobedo.
“in
fact,
you
don’t
have
to
say
anything
you
say
it,
it
can
be
used
against
you
and
you
have
a
right
to
contact
an
attorney,”
and
they
took
the
man
in.
the
man
then
still
didn’t
know
what
his
choice,
well
at
least
the
police
didn’t.
the
police
had
a
difficult
time
to
verify
the
choice
because
the
man
said
that
he
had
committed
a
crime
in
new
orleans
parish.
well,
not
knowing
to
him,
he
had
just
crossed
the
line
and
had
murdered
the
girl
in
plaquemine
parish.
so,
the
police
in
tucson
didn’t’
really
had
the
opportunity
to
either
check
his
stories
and
see
why
he
was
wanted.
now,
in
tucson,
talking
to
these
policemen,
in
which,
our
state
court,
and
the
trial
court
also,
said
it
was
a
very
relaxed
conversation.
he
was
a
man
who
wanted
to
get
something
off
of
his
chest.
he’s
a
man
who
flagged
the
policeman
down,
the
man
who
wanted
to
talk
about
something
that
had
occurred,
to
talk
to
the
policeman
who
knew
nothing
about
it.
and,
our
court
and
the
state
supreme
court
ruled,
of
course,
the
johnson
case
was
applicable
where
they
said
even
in
the--
over
and
above
the
johnson
case,
they
felt
this
confession
met
that
comment
in
the
miranda
case,
that
you
don’t
have
to
stop
a
man
when
he
walks
to
the
police
and
flags
you
down
and
wants
to
get
something
off
of
his
chest.
so,
in
this
writ,
there’s
no
issue
raised
whatsoever
as
to
the
voluntary
nature
of
this
confession
and
this
confession
meets
all
the
tests
of
being
voluntary.
the
only
issue
arises
are
the
following
testimony
in
which
this
police
officer
from
tucson
gave
the
defendant’s
confession.
included
in
that
confession,
was
this
comment
and
i’ll
read
it
for
the
court.
this
is
the
police
officer
talking.
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
that’s--
i’m
not
in
the
appendix.
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
this
is
on
page
5
of
my
brief,
sir.
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
“yes,
he
did.
he
told
me
that,
several
months
prior
to
this
taking
place,
he
picked
up
a
woman
whom
he
described
is
a
prostitute
downtown
in
new
orleans.”
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
they
asked
him
if
wel--
weather
or
not
he
had
walked
in
this--
i’ll
just
put
it
this
way
now.
during
the
course
of
his
relating
the
confession,
when
the
police
officer
arrived
at
the
point
in
which
he
was
then
going
to
relate
this
comment
relative
to
the
previous
incident,
the
defense
objected
and
has
a
long
protracted
argument.
and,
after
the
court
had
ruled
that
this
was
admissible
on
the
basis
that
it
was
part
of
the
confession
and
under
the
state
statute,
it--
the
confession
had
to
be
used
in
its
entirety
and
this
was
admissible.
so,
this
picks
up
right
after
the
argument
in
the
decision
of
the
trial
judge
that
that
question
was
admissible.
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
there
may
have
been.
if
i
please--
i’m
not
quite
certain.
i
believe
there
was
a
particular
question
because
it
has
been
raised
at--
earlier
in
the
preliminary
statement,
in
order
to
introduce
the
profession,
it
had
been
mentioned
in
the
preliminary
statement
and
an
argument
had
ensued
on
that
basis.
this
statement
had
been
mentioned
when
the
judge
took
under
the
questions
whether
or
not
the
confession
was
voluntary,
and
this
comes
now
for
the
first
time
that
the
jury
has
heard
this
actual
testimony
and
i
would
imagine
to
say
it
was
in
the
form
of
a
question,
knowing
the
stopping,
so
as
to
make
certain
that
all
the
arguments
are
presented
thereto.
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
well,
sir,
we
did
this--
we--
in
the
introduction
of
this
evidence,
we
go
on
a--
went
on
a
two-pronged
attack
in
so
far
as
the
introduction.
number
one,
we
said
under
the
state
statute,
title
15450,
it
says
that
if
you
use
a
confession,
the
confession
must
be
used
in
its
entirety.
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
well,
i’ll
say
this.
this
is
a
state
statute
which
does
not
give
the
district
attorney
any
discretion
for
him
to
say
what
he
shall
put
in,
what
he
shall
not
put
in.
this
is
meant
for
the
protection
of
the
defendant,
yes,
sir.
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
it's
meant
--
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
there
is
no
provision
to
waive
that
protection.
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
the
--
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
he
objected,
yes,
sir.
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
i
suppose
he
could
go
toward
waiving
it,
yes,
sir,
but
the
state
statute
--
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
the
waive
--
objection?
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
no,
sir.
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
no,
sir.
well,
i’m
trying
to
get
over
this
point,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
no,
sir.
i
say
this
--
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
well,
mr.
justice,
i’ll
say
this.
we
had
two
bases
upon
which
we
said
this
testimony
was
admissible.
were
very
strong
then
and
very
strong
now.
this
testimony
was
admissible
because
the
law
said
in
the
state
of
louisiana
that,
to
use
the
confession,
you’ve
got
to
use
the
confession
in
its
entirety.
secondly,
and
we
argued
very
strenuously
and
still
do
here,
that
this
testimony
was
appropriate,
was
admissible
because
it
intended
to
show
motive
and
intent.
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
this
was
one
of
those
instances
--
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
that’s
what
i
--
when
you
look
at
the
circumstances--
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
well,
again,
the
circumstance
is
so.
when
you
read
his
statement
in
which
he
says
exactly
what
took
place
in
this
prior
incident,
what
took
place
in
a
crime
in
which
we’ve
charged
him,
they’re
almost
identical
incidents.
and,
we
show
that
this
man,
on
the
basis
that
someone
would
complain
against
him,
and
these
are
his
very
words
i’m
going
to
read
you,
“would
take
a
gun
and
kill
that
person
for
having
complained
against
him.”
and,
we
say
that’s
essential.
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
sir,
we
had
two
bases.
the
statute
said
we
had
to
do
it
and
we
also
say
it’s
admissible.
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
now,
this
is
the
man’s
statement,
if
i
get
back
to
it.
“yes,
he
did.
he
told
me
that,
several
months
prior
to
this
taking
place,
he
picked
up
a
woman
whom
he
described
as
a
prostitute
downtown
in
new
orleans,
that
after
having
several
drinks
together,
they
had
intercourse
and
then,
in
his
statement
in
his
own
words,
she
went
down
on
me.
he
then
said
that
an
argument--
that
after
an
argument
that
she
slapped
him
and
he
backed-hand
her.
then,
he
said
that,
a
while
later,
she
signed
a
complaint
against
him
for
backhanding
her
and
that
he
received
the
sentence
of
90
days.
of
which,
he
did
45.
he
said
that,
immediately
after
getting
out
of
jail
from
doing
the
45
days,
that
he
went
out
and
got
a
gun
and
looked
for
two
or
three
nights
for
her
downtown
in
the
area
where
he
had
first
seen
her
with
the
intention
of
killing
her
because
she
had
signed
a
complaint
against
him.”
present
case,
the
facts
almost
identical
because
we
have
no
witness
to
say
what
really
happened
in
that
argument
view
because
this
victim
we
have
wasn’t
quite
as
fortunate
as
the
first
woman.
he
didn’t
find
her.
the
victim
we
have
in
the
second
question
was
murdered.
now,
that
was
the
--
this
is
the
entire
statement.
that
--
what
i
just
read
is
the
entire
statement
the
jury
heard
with
reference
to
this.
we
say
that,
under
our
statute,
we
had
no
alternative.
we
had
to
produce
he’s
statement
in
its
entirety.
so,
where
the
lower
court
ruled,
that’s
the
way
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
ruled
in
a
long
line
of
decisions.
now,
we
don’t
--
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
yes,
sir,
i
would
for
this
reason,
and
this
is
--
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
this
--
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
this
we
did
do
in
our
office
--
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
in
our
area,
yes,
sir,
for
this
reason.
this
statute
was
intended
that
this
man
would
have
the
benefit
of
having
the
jury
hear
his
confession
in
the
same
way
he
gave
it.
now,
whatever
he
may
consider
to
be
irrelevant
or
not,
a
juror
may
attest
a
certain
way,
too,
and
one
of
the
reasons
for
putting
this
statute
in
was
not
to
give
me,
as
a
prosecutor,
the
opportunity
to
ser
--
determine
what
i
should
withhold,
what
i
should
keep
in
the
background
or
having
it
with
a
conference
between
myself
and
the
defense
hits
it,
you’ve
got
to
tell
the
jury
everything
just
like
the
man
told
it
to
you.
you’ve
got
to
relay
all
the
instances
and
let
the
jury
draw
their
own
conclusions
with
respect
to
this
individual’s
testi
--
confession,
and
that’s
what
was
done
--
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
well,
you
see,
if
your
honor
--
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
if
the
chief
justice
would
please,
this
is
not
that
kind
of
a
case.
this
is
a
case
in
tucson
where
the
man
was
walking,
in
which
they
have
no
background
whatsoever
on
the
man,
no
opportunity
whatsoever
to
--
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
this
is
background
to
this
third
lie.
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
yes,
but
this
is
not
a
question
for
them
to
ask
him
questions
concerning
this.
this
is
something
the
man
volunteered,
came
up
with
his
own
free
will,
talking
to
people
who
had
no
opportunity
even
to
search
back
to
the
term
in
what
they
were
considering.
it’s
an
entirely
different
situation,
and
that
question
did
not
arise
in
this
particular
instance.
now,
we
say
this
information
was
essential
over
and
above
the
statute,
and
we
call
--
we
contend
in
our
brief
that
he
has
no
comfort
whatsoever
in
spencer.
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
correct,
sir.
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
no,
sir,
there’s
no
distinction.
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
there
is
no
distinction
made
in
the
jurisprudence
of
the
state.
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
yes,
as
i
said
before,
if
your
honor
please,
they
had
given
the
background
when
this
was
mentioned
in
the
old
case
in
which
we
had
to
mention,
in
order
to
have
it,
appear
in
the
trial
and
use
it.
when
it
was
mentioned
that
it
was
considerable
argument
as
to
whether
or
not
this
police
officer
could
state
this
part
of
the
confession,
when
the
confession
was
heard
by
the
trial
judge
as
to
whether
or
not
it
was
voluntary,
argument
ensued
on
this
particular
point.
when
the
thing
was
founded
presented
to
the
jury,
the
trial
judge
had
ruled.
it
went
on
into
the
confession
and
then
came
this
point,
and
it
came
at
this
point
with
the
question
where
it
was
stopped
on
the
basis
that
defendant,
again,
raised
their
objection
when
it
was
being
presented
to
the
jury
--
the
presence
of
the
jury.
he
objected
three
times.
and,
it
was
in
the
course
knowing
when
these
objections
were
coming
out
and
affording
the
defendant
the
opportunity
--
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
to
go
ahead
and
object.
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
well,
the
theory
behind
this
particular
statute,
as
i
view
it,
sir,
is
the
fact
that
they
don’t
give
me,
as
a
prosecutor,
the
discretion
to
say
what
i
should
or
should
not
put
in.
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
no,
sir,
it
--
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
correct,
sir,
it’s
part
of
--
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
correct,
sir,
that’s
what
the
statute
says
and
that’s
the
way
--
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
of
course,
if
your
honor
please,
he
doesn’t
have
to
say
every
word,
but
of
course
he
has
to
give
the
--
a
substance
under
the
jurisprudence
but
he
cannot
leave
out
items
such
as
that
that
he
figures
to
be
irrelevant
under
the
state
statute.
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
correct,
sir.
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
yes,
sir.
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
yes,
sir.
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
our
state
court,
if
your
honor
please,
considered
it
under
title
15.
this
statute
--
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
and
also,
we
have
two
other
statutes
which
we’ve
mentioned
with
respect
to
the
admissibility
of
previous
offenses
when
they
tend
to
show
motive,
mode
of
operation,
guilty,
knowledge,
and
so
forth
and
so
on
--
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
within
the
traditional
cases
that
this
court
has
recognized.
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
no,
sir,
the
trial
court
ruled
that
it
had
to
come
in
on
the
basis
that
it
was
part
of
the
confession,
and
our
state
supreme
court
did
not
go.
but
we
briefed
both
issues,
but
the
state
supreme
court
arrived
at
one
issue
and
said
“this
is
determinative,”
and
didn’t
reach
the
other
question.
but,
we’ve
raised
them
both
times.
we
argue
both
of
them
here
on
the
very
same
basis.
we
--
quickly
winding
up
when
one
--
also,
the
question
of
spencer,
we
say,
does
not
give
any
hope
or
encouragement
with
respect
to
the
peti
--
position
of
the
defendant.
spencer
would
not
entitle
him
to
set
the
statute
aside.
he
may
have
a
different
opinion
as
to
what
it
should
be,
but
the
statute
says
that
is
what
the
--
we
should
do.
it’s
a
rule
of
evidence
in
the
state
of
louisiana
ans
on
the
books
for
many,
many
years
--
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
it’s
been
on
the
books
for
many,
many
years.
we
think
it’s
an
essential
part.
it
is
not
violative
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
he
relies
on
the
gentle
fairness
approach,
such
as
they
did
in
spencer.
this
is
not
a
berget
case
where
he
has
a
denial
of
a
specific
federal
right.
there
is
no
specific
federal
right
involved
here.
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
thank
you,
sir.
that
the
spencer
case
applicable
in
this
instance
would
uphold
this
statute
of
the
state
of
louisiana,
and
i
refer
to
this
particular
language
in
the
statute
that
it
would
be
wholly
unjustified,
encroached
by
this
court
upon
the
constitutional
powers
of
the
states
to
promulgate
their
own
rules
of
evidence
to
try
their
own
state
created
crimes
in
their
own
state
courts.
i
also
point
out
that
the
berget
case
was
--
this
court
decided
after
the
spencer
decision,
i
take
no
issue
with
that
case
either.
the
berget
case
found
that
there
was
a
specific
federal
constitutional
right
involved.
the
question
of
this
defendant
had
been
denied
the
right
of
counsel
in
one
of
his
state
prosecutions,
and
that
this
court
wasn’t
going
to
allow
error
to
be
piled
on
top
of
an
error
and
allow
him
to
be
denied
it
at
a
second
time
and,
rightfully
so,
in
the
berget
case.
we
also
take
the
position
that
even
under
the
minority
decision
in
the
spencer
case,
that
this
evidence
which
we
introduced
meets
the
test
that
this
court
was
talking
about
in
all
of
its
decisions.
this
information
was
essential.
this
--
under
the
state
law
in
which
this
man
was
being
prosecuted,
he
was
charged
with
murder.
under
our
state
code,
murder
is
the
killing
of
a
human
being
when
the
offender
has
a
specific
intent
to
kill
or
to
inflict
great
bodily
harm.
in
furtherance
of
carrying
out
our
responsibility
to
prove
intent
as
a
necessary
ingredient
of
the
crime
of
murder,
this
evidence
was
inadmissible.
i’ve
cited
several
state
cases
directly
on
point
in
which
they
deal
with
the
question
that
when
intent
is
a
necessary
ingredient
of
the
crime
charged,
it’s
something
which
goes
to
the
determination
of
the
issue
directly
before
the
jury
with
respect
to
intent,
that
it
is
admissible
in
a
long
list
of
cases
in
our
jurisprudence,
and
those
cases
have
also
been
recognized
by
this
court
that
they
are
exceptions
to
that
general
rule.
we
say
we
fall
under
it,
number
one,
because
it’s
our
statute.
it
would
not
be
within
the
providence
of
this
court
to
rewrite
that
statute
under
spencer.
secondly,
even
if
this
court
were
to
say
that
that
statute
would
be
unconstitutional,
we
say
that
this
evidence
is
admissible.
on
the
other
decisions
of
this
court
and
other
state
court,
on
the
basis
that
we
were
showing
motive
and
intent,
and
when
you
look
at
the
brief
--
in
my
brief,
if
your
honors
please,
on
page
18,
i’ve
laid
side-by-side
the
facts
in
this
case
in
which
we
charge
this
man
with
murder
and
the
facts
of
the
previous
incident.
he’s
come
across
the
river,
the
same
area
of
town,
picks
up
a
girl
in
the
same
area,
has
drinks
with
her,
commits
certain
acts,
one
winds
up
where
she
complains,
he
gets
a
gun
and
goes
out
with
intent
to
kill
her
because
she
complained
of
his
conduct.
and,
we
say
the
second
girl
wasn’t
quite
so
lucky.
she
was
killed
before
she
could
complain.
now,
we
say
this
draws
a
definite
parallel
and
this
is
essential
information.
it
was
information
that
the
state
was
required
to
put
in,
in
order
to
prove
intent
and
we
carried
our
responsibility
with
respect
thereto.
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
yes,
sir,
that’s
our
position.
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
yes,
sir.
the
statute
which
says
the
entire
confession
must
be
used
in
its
entirety.
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
yes,
sir.
long
line
of
decisions.
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
yes,
it’s
a
general
rule
with
respect
to
any
--
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
right,
sir.
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
yes,
if
it’s
part
of
the
confession,
it
has
to
be
introduced.
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
well,
yes,
sir.
the
--
they
start
up
with
mani
case.
in
fact,
the
evidence
case
which
was
decided
by
our
state
supreme
court
just
prior
to
this
case,
came
up
to
this
court
and
which
were
refused,
involving
the
very
same
principles
under
444
and
446
on
the
intent
and
also
under
the
use
of
this
statute.
like
i
said,
i
didn’t
brief
the
question
about
whether
the
case
should
be
here.
i
didn’t
believe
it
should
be,
but
i
just
took
the
position
that
you
had
granted
it
and
i
was
--
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
no,
sir.
it
did
not.
i
--
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
my
brief
says
--
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
no,
sir.
what
i’m
doing,
sir,
is
really
answering
that
which
he
has
inserted
in
his
application
in
which
the
application
was
granted.
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
no,
sir.
i
don’t
believe
it
has
jurisdiction,
sir.
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
yes,
sir.
i
don’t
believe
it
has
jurisdiction.
i
didn’t
then
and
i
didn’t
brief
it
on
the
basis
that
the
writs
will
be
in
the
--
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
yes,
sir,
and
i
just
then
--
in
my
brief,
i’ve
concerned
myself
with
answering
the
georgia’s
--
and
i
say,
even
if
you
had
jurisdiction,
i
say
we
answer
all
of
his
charges.i’ll
make
just
one
quick
closing
comment,
if
your
honors
please.
isthat
there
was
some
reference
--
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
i
use
the
same
reasoning
with
perspective
that
as
i
did
with
the
other
ones,
with
my
brief
in
this,
sir.
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
i
say
my
reasoning
then
was
the
same
as
in
that
instance.
i
presumed
on
the
basis
when
you
--
when
i
was
asked
or
a
brief
on
response
to
the
points,
raised
by
him
that
the
other
question
was
already
resolved.
now
that’s
my
--
in
that
respect.
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
well,
all
i
say
is
that’s
the
conclusion
i
reached,
and
that’s
why
it’s
not
mentioned
in
there,
if
your
honor
please.
i
make
this
argument
when
we
mentioned
witherspoon
before.
i
mentioned
it
here
because
some
question
was
raised
as
to
whether
or
not
a
state
had
shifted
its
position
in
a
question
raised
about
fairness.
i
know
the
--
in
the
berget
place,
we
were
--
the
court
says
we
are
not
be
concerned
with
the
question
of
good
faith,
but
i
wanted
to
bring
up
one
thing
with
witherspoon.
we
have
met
the
requirements
of
witherspoon
in
this
very
case
which
was
long
before
this
court
decided
witherspoon.
we
have
a
statute
similar
to
illinois
and
louisiana.
we
had
a
man
who
said
he
was
opposed
to
capital
punishment.
we
questioned
the
man
until
he
finally
reached
the
point
when
he
said
“well,
i
couldn’t,
under
any
circumstances,”
and
we
allowed
that
man
go
and
we
did
not
charge
him,
and
such
a
juror
did
serve
in
this
case.
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
no,
sir.
mr.
preston
h.
hufft
correct
sir.
i
understand.
i
mentioned
that
only
in
question
with
basis
of
good
faith
as
the
situation
goes.
i
have
no
further
questions.
thank
you,
your
honors.
