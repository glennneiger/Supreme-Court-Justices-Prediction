justice
potter
stewart
did
you
seek
to
exclude
it
on
the
basis
of
the
united
states
constitution
or
just
as
a
matter
of
state?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
but
i’m--
i
think
you
understand
my
question.
justice
potter
stewart
wondering
if
you--
the
time
you
raised
or,
in
any
event,
when
for
the
fede--
when
you
raised
any
federal
question
in
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
of
certiorari
in
this
court?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
what
do
you
get
out
of
that
sentence
you’ve
just
read
from
the
majority
that
would
help
you?
justice
potter
stewart
the
louisiana
statute
that
the
court
relied
on,
do
you
find
that
sort
of
a
statute
in
other
states?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
which
louisiana
has
a
different
historical
background,
doesn’t
it,
in
its--
justice
potter
stewart
doesn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
only
in
the
civil
law
area?
justice
potter
stewart
that’s
interesting.
i
suppose
you’re
sure
about
that?
justice
potter
stewart
i
suppose
the
purpose
of
the
statute
that
requires
that
if
any
part
of
the
confession
is
offered
by
the
prosecution,
then
the
entirety
must
be
offered
was,
at
least
arguably,
to
protect
the
defendant
in
the
case,
wasn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
is
this
a
written
confession?
justice
potter
stewart
when
he
was
arrested
in
some
other
state.
justice
potter
stewart
oral
confession
to
the
law
enforcement
officers
over
there,
the
arresting
officers.
justice
potter
stewart
this--
your
client
is
under
sentence
of
death,
is
he?
justice
potter
stewart
suppose
you
said
that
spencer
against
texas
was
a
case
decided
after
the
trial
of
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
which
explains,
you
say,
why
you
didn’t
raise
this
point
as
a
constitutional
point
during
the
course
of
the
trial
or
the
appeals
through
the
courts
of
louisiana.
suppose
other
cases
have
subsequently
been
decided
that
might
affect
the
constitutional
rights
of
your
client
now,
haven’t
they
been?
i’m
thinking
particularly
of
the
witherspoon
case.
remember
that
case?
justice
potter
stewart
we’ve
got
that
kind
of
a
claim
in
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
just
a
question.
i
just--
the
purpose
of
that
question
is
to
suggest
that
maybe
an
appropriate
forum
might
be
a
federal
habeas
corpus
court,
the
district
court,
rather
than
here
where
the
record
is--
it’s
where
your
points
were
never
raised
as
federal
questions.
justice
potter
stewart
there
used
to
be
a
requirement
before
you
could
go
into
federal
habeas
corpus
that
you
must
have
petitioned
for
certiorari
here,
but
that
hasn’t
been
true
for
many
years.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
and
sentenced
to
death
the
next
day.
justice
potter
stewart
stayed
with
the
state
court?
justice
potter
stewart
where
are
you
in
the
appendix?
what
page?
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
can
i
ask
you
a
question.
did
your
state
court
consider
this
under
the
common
law
rule
about
it?
justice
potter
stewart
what
does
it
say?
justice
potter
stewart
did
they--
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
courts
considered
it
at
the
last
--
justice
potter
stewart
your
view
is
under
the
(inaudible).
justice
potter
stewart
let
me
ask
you
this.
your
state
courts,
taking
the
other
route
and
a
whole
other
statute
and
had
it
turned.
was
that
statute
construed
in
the
same
fashion
(inaudible).
justice
potter
stewart
yes?
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
think
any
other
than
involuntary
statements?
justice
potter
stewart
all
statutes
say
that?
justice
potter
stewart
it’s
construed
in
this
case
then
that
before
a
county
can
issue
the
instruction
of
that
statute,
they
must
consider,
in
general,
the
statute
with
respect
to
other
involuntary
statements
saying
that
he
wasn’t
--
justice
potter
stewart
you
said
those
other
earlier
cases
in
order
to
dissent
from
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
of
course,
that’s
not
a
question,
in
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
a
is
before
us
or
b
if
it
were,
if
they
were
before
us,
then
we
could
possibly
decide
without
having
the
warranty
--
justice
potter
stewart
that’s
got
something
to
do
with
the
comment
rule.
justice
potter
stewart
you
had
a
comment
rule
on
the
defendant’s
failure
to
testify
which
is
--
justice
potter
stewart
really
the
spencer
case,
it’s
more
of
the
spencer
dissent
that
you
rely
on,
isn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
did
you
seek
to
exclude
it
on
