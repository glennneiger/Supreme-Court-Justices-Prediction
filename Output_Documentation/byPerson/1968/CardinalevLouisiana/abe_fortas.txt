justice
abe
fortas
but,
is
that
applicable
here?
i
know
the
state
cert--
i
think
i
recall
that
state
supreme
court
did
not
rely
on
this
point,
but
it--
isn’t
the
fact
that
this
prior
conviction
was
part
of
the
story
as
to
the
motive,
the
alleged
motive,
for
the
petitioners
killing
this
woman?
justice
abe
fortas
i’m
not
either.
i’m
talking
about
motive.
could
the--
well,
hasn’t
then
the
state
alleged
that
the
state
said
the
reason
that
this
petitioner
killed
this
woman
was
that
she
had
been
the
prosecutrix
in
the
prior
conviction,
isn’t
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
how
could
the
state
have
proved
motive?
am
i
right,
too,
that
state
supreme
court
does
not
rely
upon
that?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
how
could
they--
justice
abe
fortas
sir?
justice
abe
fortas
this
was
a
different
woman?
justice
abe
fortas
that
so,
would
you
make
a
distinction
between
the
application
of
a
louisiana
statute
to
a
written
confession
and
to
this
kind
of
a
situation?
that
is
to
say,
what
happened
here
is
that
the
petitioner
talked
to
the
police
in
tucson
and
told
--
i
suppose
he
told
them
a
lot
of
things.
now,
would
you
make
a
distinction
between
--
and
then
the
police
officer
took
the
stand
in
louisiana
and
testified.
justice
abe
fortas
now,
is
there
a
distinction
in
the
application
of
the
louisiana
statute
between
that
kind
of
situation
and
a
written
confession
with
respect
to
what
is
appropriate
and
what’s
not
appropriate?
justice
abe
fortas
as
a
matter
of
commonsense,
it
would
seem
that
maybe
you
could
make
such
a
distinction.
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
i
noticed
here
that,
actually,
the
state
knew
about
the
previous
offense
and
its
relationship
with
this
other
woman,
as
appears
on
page
509
of
the
typed
transcript,
that
that
was
elicited
by
--
from
the
police
officer,
the
tucson
police
officer,
by
question
of
the
prosecuting
attorney.
justice
abe
fortas
well
i
suppose
--
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
i
understand,
but
i
suppose
that
it’s
at
least
arguable
that
the
question
is,
what
is
the
confession?
now,
when
you
have
a
written
confession
that
is
a
confession,
when
you
have
a
police
officer
testifying
as
to
what
the
defendant
told
him,
i
suppose
it’s
questionable
as
to
what
is
the
--
it’s
arguable
anyway
that,
what
is
the
confession
within
the
meaning
and
intendment
of
this
louisiana
statute?
he
might
have
told
him
all
sorts
of
things
that,
all
lawyers
would
agree,
are
not
admissible
in
the
course
of
the
conversation
between
the
defendant
and
the
police
officer,
isn’t
that
conceivable?
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that
but,
on
the
other
hand,
the
question
is
whether
that
statute
should
--
has
a
different
implication
with
respect
to
a
written
confession.
justice
abe
fortas
or
--
and,
with
respect
to
what
the
policeman
says
now.
would
you
take
the
position
that
everything,
everything
that
the
defendant
told
the
police
officer
in
tucson
is
admi--
not
only
admissible,
but
has
to
be
received
in
evidence?
justice
abe
fortas
because
everything
he
said
is
part
of
the
confession,
whether
it
properly
relates
to
this
crime
or
not.
justice
abe
fortas
well
that’s
impossible
and,
i
suppose,
that
it
would
be
impossible
for
the
police
officer
to
do
that
and
maybe
if
they
taped
every
word
he
said,
the
defendant
said,
they
could
do
it.
justice

fortas

is
