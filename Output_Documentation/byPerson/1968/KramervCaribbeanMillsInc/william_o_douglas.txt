justice
william
o.
douglas
mr.
lyons,
may
i
just
get
back
a
moment
to
your
colloquy
with
justice
white.
did
i
understand
you
correctly
to
say
that,
the
test
here
of
collusion
should
be
their
attention
of
an
economic
interest
in
this
instance
is
95%
of
the
66
and
two-thirds
but
the
assignor?
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
it's
s
not
--
i
thought
you
also
suggested
to
justice
white
that
if
he
lost
when
he
had
nothing
to
return
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
then
what?
there's
nothing?
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
could
you
concede
that
in
that
circumstance,
there
would
be
jurisdiction?
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
but
the
point
is,
do
i
understand
you
correctly
that
because
under
this
arrangement,
we
ask
not
on
paper
that
a
95%
it
was
in
66
and
two-thirds
per
cent
of
any
recovery
if
there
was
a
recovery.
justice
william
o.
douglas
does
that
factor
in
and
of
itself
establishes
collusion?
justice
william
o.
douglas
that's
what
i
wanted
to
get.
justice
william
o.
douglas
so
in
addition
to
that
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
now,
what
did
you
say
would
be
the
answer
if
this
suit
had
only
been
for
5%
of
the
66
and
two-thirds
percent?
if
that's
all
what
mr.
kramer
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
why
mr.
lyons
does
that
splitting
cause
of
action,
if
there's
an
outright
assignment
of
5%
of
something,
that
means
that
someone
else
own
this
95%
but
he
owns
5%?
why
wouldn't
he
been
able
just
to
bring
this
lawsuit
just
4%
or
5%
over
it?
justice
william
o.
douglas
impose
rejoinder
kind
of
approach?
