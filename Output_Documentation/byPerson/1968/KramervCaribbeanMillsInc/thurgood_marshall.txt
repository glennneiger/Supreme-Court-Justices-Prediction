mr.
gressman,
did
i
understand
your
correctly
to
say
the
same
lawyer
who
represented
caribbean
and
kramer?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
court
has
said
there
was
one
lawyer
who
persuaded
mr.
kramer
to
do
this.
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
he
represent
caribbean?
justice
thurgood
marshall
who
represented
caribbean
at
the
trial?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how
can
you
say
that
kramer
had
full
control
of
the
case
when
he
had
caribbean's
lawyer?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
misunderstood.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
gressman,
could
i
look
at
this
as
being
in
the
assignment
of
5%
of
this?
justice
thurgood
marshall
wouldn't
that
be
quote
“improper”
for
the
purpose
of
getting
federal
jurisdiction
or
for
100%.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
make
federal
jurisdictions
on
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it's
gone
for
the
whole
100%.
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
have
any
of
those
cases
cited?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
that's
all
i'm
talking
about.
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
he
did
file
for
the
5%,
couldn't
you
insist
that
the
other
party
to
join
and
then
he
lose
the
verdict?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
would
think
--
so
i
think
unless
the
--
two
of
them
sue,
if
you
assume
that
there
is
an
assignment
of
only
5%
of
the
legal
title,
the
--
you'd
have
to
join
it
up.
now,
in
some
ways
this
case
is
unique.
people
have
not
tried
to
this
sort
of
thing
recently
to
put
it
normally.
the
--
there
were
a
lot
of
cases
in
the
first
35
years
after
the
passage
of
the
staff
until
this
court,
there
was
a
whole
line
of
cases
and
there
was
a
development
of
the
law
that
discourage
doing
this
sort
of
thing.
and
this
is
a
rather
unique
case,
there
are
no
other
cases
holding
that
an
assignee
for
collection
only
may
sue
in
its
own
name
in
the
federal
court
and
thereby
create
diversity.
this
is
the
first
page
to
reach
this
court
after
1948
revision
but
the
pre-revision
cases
teach
that
this
is
an
improper
and
collusive
assignment.
justice
thurgood
marshall
indeed,
all
you
would
need
would
be
some
clerk
in
the
law
office
that
lived
in
oklahoma?
