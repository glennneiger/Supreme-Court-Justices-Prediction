mr.
dennis
g.lyons
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
to
restate
the
facts
of
somewhat
greater
length,
in
the
summer
of
1964
there
were
two
lawyers
in
wichita
falls,
texas,
one
was
mr.
jack
banner,
one
was
mr.
clayton
kramer.
mr.
banner
according
to
the
record
was
briefing
a
legal
point
in
connection
with
a
contract
that
contract
was
the
contract
between
panama
and
venezuela
finance
company
and
caribbean
mills,
inc.
both
of
those
are
alien
corporations.
neither
of
them
could
have
sued
the
other
in
federal
court.
the
contract
under
panama's
view
of
it
was
already
two
years
in
default.
there
were
annual
installment
payments
an
under
panama's
view
three
annual
installment
payments
have
already
gone
by
without
payment
having
been
made.
one
day,
mr.
kramer
and
mr.
banner
met
as
they
had
many
times
in
the
past
and
mr.
banner
said
to
mr.
kramer
that
there
was
a
claim
which
might
be
acquired
obviously
mr.
banner
must
have
gotten
the
claim
from
somewhere
and
that
conversation
which
is
in
the
record
evidently
indicates
an
authority
on
mr.
banner's
part
to
offer
the
claim
to
mr.
kramer.
well,
one
thing
led
to
another
mr.
kramer
by
the
way
knew
nothing
about
the
claim,
he
was
a
perfect
stranger
to
the
transaction,
didn't
know
any
of
the
parties
involved.
somewhere
in
the
shuffle,
mr.
banner
became
mr.
kramer's
lawyer
and
the
parties
sat
down
and
they
prepared
not
one
but
two
legal
documents.
one
of
them
was
an
assignment
of
claim
which
assignment
did
not
refer
to
the
second
document.
the
assignment
reflected
that
the
consideration
was
$1.00
and
other
good
and
valuable
considerations.
the
record
is
clear
that
the
only
money
that
change
hands
was
the
$1.00.
the
other
agreement
is
the
agreement
which
the
petitioner
calls
the
collateral
agreement
for
which
we
called
the
side
agreement
but
actually
the
two
words
means
the
same
thing.
and
in
that
agreement
which
unlike
the
first
agreement
referred
to
the
other
document,
in
that
agreement
there
was
covenant
on
the
part
of
mr.
kramer
to
prosecute
the
claim
to
final
judgment
and
there
was
a
promise
on
mr.
kramer's
part
to
pay
95%
of
the
net
recovery
on
the
claim
back
to
the
assignor,
panama.
now,
even
though
mr.
kramer
in
his
somewhat
difficult
testimony
in
the
transcript
never
admitted
that
the
motive
for
this
transaction
was
to
create
federal
jurisdiction.
counsel
has
admitted
various
times
that
the
motive
and
another
times
a
motive
was
to
create
federal
jurisdiction
and
the
record
suggests
no
other
motive
brought
by
it.
the
parties
then,
mr.
kramer
and
mr.
banner
entered
into
a
contingent
fee
agreement
the
side
agreement
that
mr.
kramer
in
panama
had
entered
into
permitted
mr.
kramer
to
enter
into
contingent
fee
agreements
up
to
33
of
the
30%
and
that
sort
of
arrangement
was
in
fact
entered
into
mr.
banner's
firm
and
six
weeks
later,
there
was
a
suit
filed
in
kramer's
name
in
the
federal
court.
mr.
dennis
g.lyons
yes,
that
comes
of
the
top
and
then
the
5%
slice
comes
out
from
mr.
kramer
and
then
the
other
95%
goes
back
to
panama.
mr.
dennis
g.lyons
of
the
66
and
two-thirds.
mr.
dennis
g.lyons
(inaudible)
mr.
dennis
g.lyons
i
would
think
that
no
impropriety
had
occurred
at
this
time
up
to
the
time
that
the
complaint
was
filed.
now,
when
you
take
single
unitary
transaction
and
put
it
in
two
pieces
of
paper
rather
than
one
that
ended
up
itself
is
not
fraudulent
or
improper.
but
it
certainly
gives
you
the
means
to
commit
an
impropriety
or
to
commit
a
fraud.
mr.
dennis
g.lyons
gives
you
the
means
to
commit
an
impropriety
or
to
commit
a
fraud
because
it
creates
a
situation
in
which
you
can
refer
to
one
document
and
keep
the
other
document
in
your
desk
drawer.
and
in
the
complaint
--
mr.
dennis
g.lyons
i
would
say
that
was.
mr.
dennis
g.lyons
it
is
our
position
that
it
is,
your
honor.
indeed,
it's
our
position
that
even
if
this
was
openly
done
and
of
course
once
the
discovery
procedures
start
working
the
facts
came
out
in
the
open.
but
even
if
this
was
openly
done
that
this
amounts
to
under
the
teachings
of
the
cases
in
this
court
to
an
improper
and
collusive
assignment.
the
complaint
was
then
filed
in
the
federal
court.
the
complaint
alleged
that
panama
had
assigned,
sold,
and
delivered
its
entire
interest
and
rights
in
the
agreement
to
clayton
s.
kramer.
it
didn't
say
a
word
about
the
fact
that
panama
has
a
beneficial
interest
in
95%
of
the
net
recovery.
not
unexpectedly
the
defense
of
the
lawsuit
wondered
somewhat
is
to
how
this
claim
turned
up
in
the
hands
of
the
lawyer
from
wichita
falls
and
mr.
kramer's
deposition
was
taken
and
he
was
asked
on
deposition
series
of
questions
which
are
in
the
record
as
to
how
he
came
to
be
the
owner
of
the
claim
and
he
declined
to
answer
all
those
questions.
he
declined
to
answer
questions
as
to
the
existence
of
agreements
between
him
and
panama
apart
from
the
face
of
the
assignment.
and
finally,
an
order
of
the
court
was
obtained
and
the
collateral
agreement
was
produced
in
response
to
the
order
of
the
court.
mr.
dennis
g.lyons
simply
on
the
advice
of
counsel.
the
central
question
in
this
case
is
whether
section
1359
of
the
judicial
code
bars
the
manufacturer.
the
manufacture
then
said
religiously,
the
petitioners
were
not
ours.
it
bars
the
manufacturer
of
the
diversity
jurisdiction
of
the
case
like
this.
this
report
held
no
that
the
only
relevant
consideration
was
to
look
to
the
face
of
the
assignment
and
not
to
look
to
the
other
factors.
the
court
of
appeals
said
yes.
the
essentials
as
we
see
it
of
the
arrangement
or
scheme
that
was
employed
here
are
four
in
number.
you
of
course
start
with
two
parties.
it
could
not
sue
each
other
in
the
federal
court,
sometimes
two
aliens,
sometimes
its
two
citizens
of
the
same
state.
and
the
four
factors
as
we
see
them
or
first
that
you
have
a
voluntarily
assignment
of
the
claim,
this
is
not
a
case
involving
an
executor
or
a
guardian
where
you
have
to
have
fiduciary
in
order
to
prosecute
a
claim.
this
is
a
voluntarily
assignment
of
the
claim.
it's
an
assignment
made
after
the
dispute
arose.
here,
there
were
three
annual
payments
which
allegedly
under
the
plaintiff's
theory
were
in
default.
the
third
factor
is
that
a
motive
is
to
create
or
manufacture
diversity
jurisdiction.
and
the
fourth
factor
is
the
assign
--
that
the
assignor
retains
a
beneficial
ownership
in
the
claim.
now,
in
1875
when
the
diversity
of
citizenship,
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts
was
enlarged
there
was
enacted
by
congress
a
protective
statute
which
provided
in
substantially
the
same
language
as
present
section
1359
that
the
federal
courts
would
not
have
jurisdiction
where
a
party
was
made
or
added
through
assignment
or
otherwise,
improperly
or
collusively
in
order
to
create
federal
jurisdiction.
and
in
the
35
years
after
that
statute
was
passed,
there
was
a
whole
string
of
cases,
which
came
before
this
court
which
involved
these
four
elements.
they
involved
the
assignment,
the
assignment
made
after
the
dispute
arose,
the
motive
to
create
federal
jurisdiction,
and
the
retention
of
the
beneficial
interest
in
the
claim
by
the
assignor.
that
last
is
of
course
an
important
factor.
there
are
another
line
of
cases
uphold
that
where
the
assignment
is
in
fact
absolute
where
a
party
buys
a
claim,
pays
money
for
it,
and
the
assignor
has
no
further
interest
in
the
outcome
of
a
litigation
that
you
may
then
look
at
the
assignee's
citizenship
for
the
purpose
of
determining
diversity
jurisdiction
but
this
case
is
not
on
that
side
of
the
line.
mr.
kramer
here
had
been
willing
to
make
an
evaluation
of
the
claim,
pay
money
for
it
and
in
effect
be
quits
with
panama
and
leave
panama
with
no
interest
whatsoever
in
this
claim.
the
case
has
seem
to
teach
that
that
sort
of
assignment
is
not
improper
or
collusive
but
this
line
of
cases
which
we
review
at
pages
14
to
18
of
our
brief,
which
were
decided
in
the
years
immediately
after
the
passage
of
this
statute
hold
that
where
the
assignor
has
retained
the
beneficial
interest
in
the
claim
and
the
beneficial
interest
in
these
cases
vary
some
cases.
it's
a
100%
other
cases
it
was
a
less
than
a
100%
and
the
assignee
like
mr.
kramer
here
was
given
a
percentage
for
the
use
of
his
name.
but
these
cases
hold
that
that
constitutes
an
improper
or
collusive
assignment
and
they
used
the
words
improper
or
collusive
and
applied
this
concept
of
collusion
to
this
arrangement
between
at
least
two
parties
even
though
these
are
not
two
parties
on
different
sides
of
the
lawsuits.
mr.
dennis
g.lyons
he
undertook
to
prosecute
the
claim.
mr.
dennis
g.lyons
yes.
mr.
dennis
g.lyons
no,
he
didn't.
he
couldn't
walk
away
from
this.
mr.
dennis
g.lyons
well,
if
he
had
acquired
full
title
to
the
claim,
there'd
be
no
reason
for
him
to
promise
to
--
mr.
dennis
g.lyons
well,
that's
true.
in
full
title
to
a
zero
claim
is
not
a
--
mr.
dennis
g.lyons
that's
right.
there
is
--
mr.
dennis
g.lyons
there's
no
reason
of
partition
an
empty
five
place.
it's
only
for
five
up
here
in
this
place
in
the
form
of
a
judgment
that
there'd
be
any
reason
to
cut
it
up.
mr.
dennis
g.lyons
he'd
have
5%
percent
of
the
net
recovery.
mr.
dennis
g.lyons
well,
if
he
and
the
assignor
had
joined
together
and
sued,
they
wouldn't
have
been
in
diversity
because
the
statute
does
not
cover
that,
that
sort
of
a
suit.
the
petitioner
seeks
to
distinguish
this
line
of
cases
in
this
court,
which
construed
the
statute.
on
the
three
bases,
first
they
point
to
the
effect
of
the
1948
codification.
they
--
mr.
justice,
i
believe
mr.
gressman
might
have
this
morning
that
the
assignee
clause
from
the
1789
statute
have
something
to
do
with
this.
actually,
it
did
not.
the
statute
that's
presently
on
the
books,
according
to
the
reviser's
notes
and
according
to
its
language,
a
codification
to
bring
forward
of
the
1875
statute
which
is
the
statute
under
which
this
line
of
cases
was
decided,
and
the
reviser's
notes,
even
though
they
dropped
certain
of
the
language,
the
language
that
was
dropped
was
not
the
language
relied
upon
by
the
court
in
this
old
line
of
cases.
and
the
reviser's
notes
indicate
that
the
desire
was
to
carry
forward
the
1875
act.
under
those
circumstances,
we
submit
that
the
revision
does
not
change
the
value
of
prior
cases.
the
statute
always
have
said
on
proper
or
collusive
and
this
has
been
construed
to
cover
caces
where
the
only
collusion
is
this
relationship
between
the
assignor
and
the
assignee
in
which
the
assignor
still
has
the
interest
in
the
claim.
then,
the
cases
that
sought
to
be
distinguished
on
the
grounds
that
here,
there
was
a
transfer
of
title
which
was
good
under
state
law.
well,
this
is
not
a
state
law
issue.
the
question
here
is
not
whether
mr.
kramer
could
have
brought
this
suit
in
a
state
court,
i
assume
he
couldn't.
i
sometimes
wonder
why
he
didn't.
the
question
here
is
whether
the
federal
standards
of
improper
or
collusive
if
the
clause
had
been
put
on
them
by
the
earlier
cases
on
what
that
standard
means.
in
fact,
in
a
number
of
those
cases,
the
court
seems
to
have
commented
or
to
have
assumed
that
the
assignment
was
good
under
state
law.
finally,
there
is
a
lengthy
suggestion
in
the
brief
that
somehow
even
though
this
might
not
be
good
in
the
case
of
an
assignment
where
the
real
parties
and
interest
are
citizens
of
the
same
state,
that
the
court
should
be
more
lenient
or
more
tolerant
with
respect
to
this
matter
where
the
real
party
and
interests
are
two
aliens.
i
must
confess
i'm
somewhat
unable
to
follow
this
--
mr.
dennis
g.lyons
that's
certainly
one
of
the
tests,
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
g.lyons
that's
right.
mr.
dennis
g.lyons
well,
if
he
lost
there
was
nothing
to
return.
he
owned
the
whole
claim
of
the
loss
but
--
mr.
dennis
g.lyons
no,
i
say
you
have
at
the
your
honor
that
you
have
to
look
at
the
matter
as
the
suit
is
brought
and
as
the
suit
is
brought,
he
might
win,
he
might
lose
the
reason
he
is
bringing
the
suit
was
with
the
desire
to
win.
mr.
dennis
g.lyons
that's
right.
mr.
dennis
g.lyons
that
factor
with
the
other
factors,
the
motive
to
create
federal
jurisdiction
--
mr.
dennis
g.lyons
--
which
--
mr.
dennis
g.lyons
which
when
taken
with
other
factors
this
court
has
held
are
to
involve
impropriety
and
collusion.
the
--
none
of
these
factors
standing
alone
might
give
us
a
case
of
impropriety
and
collusion
but
i
think
from
the
analysis
of
the
early
cases
that
the
early
cases
all
have
these
four
factors.
they
have
a
motive,
they
have
the
assignment,
they
have
the
fact
that
the
assignment
is
made
after
the
parties
have
fallen
into
dispute
and
it
appears
that
there
will
be
litigation,
and
they
have
the
retention
of
the
interest
by
the
assignor.
mr.
dennis
g.lyons
i
don't
know
if
caribbean
brought
for
the
5%.
i
think
probably,
i
have
been
barred
by
the
rule
against
splitting
a
cause
of
action.
what
you
have
here
is
the
unitary
claim
and
i
think
the
defendant
is
entitled
not
to
be
sued
piecemeal
by
a
number
of
--
mr.
dennis
g.lyons
well,
your
honor
i
think
there
is
a
rule
of
law
under
state
law
that,
if
you
have
the
unitary
obligation
to
pay
money
for
someone
that
that
person
can't
break
it
up
into
a
150
bits
and
then
face
you
with
a
hundred
plaintiffs
in
the
lawsuits.
and
i
think
this
unitary
cause
of
action
and
one
party
has
to
sue
on
it
and
these
papers
purport
to
vest
the
legal
title
in
him
and
interstate
court,
he
could
brought
this
suit.
and
titus
v.
wallick
holds
that
one
state
–-
if
a
state
permits
this
sort
of
suit
to
be
brought
under
this
sort
of
this
assignment,
i
supposed
most
state
courts
would
but
another
state
has
to
give
a
full
faith
in
credit
to
that
judgment
that
is
all
the
titus
v.
wallick
holds,
there's
nothing
to
do
with
the
(voice
overlap).
mr.
dennis
g.lyons
i
think
we
could
either
move
in
the
alternative
that
it
be
dismissed
on
the
basis
that
it's
the
splitting
of
the
cause
of
action
or
that
unnecessary
party
is
not
been
joined
and
of
course
once
the
necessary
parties
joined
the
case
is
no
longer
within
the
diversity
statute.
mr.
dennis
g.lyons
i
think
they
are
--
they
may
have
different
meanings
your
honor,
courts
have
use
them
both
that
they
have
held
that
where
you
have
a
--
these
factors
that
the
assignment
is
collusive
and
improper.
the
statute
uses
them
in
the
disjunction
instead
it
has
an
“or”
in
it.
but
we
would
say
that
this
was
both
collusive
in
the
sense
of
involving
this
relationship
between
the
two
parties
to
the
assignment
whereby
the
assignor
was
ousted
of
his
interest
and
it
is
improper
in
the
sense
that
it
is
not
a
proper
way
to
create
federal
jurisdiction.
now
--
mr.
dennis
g.lyons
i
supposed
so
and
whether
making
assertion
that
complaint
was
made
--
mr.
dennis
g.lyons
well
then
i
suspect
that
the
--
if
there
hadn't
been
any
effort
to
conceal
it
here,
i
would
agree.
but
i
think
the
result
is
the
same
whether
or
not
there
had
been
the
effort
to
conceal
it.
mr.
dennis
g.lyons
that
it
means
a
device
which
is
made
from
the
motive
of
creating
federal
jurisdiction
and
which
does
not
oust
the
assignor
of
his
interest
of
the
claim.
now,
--
mr.
dennis
g.lyons
i've
studied,
your
honor
from
the
prior
cases
of
the
court
which
involved
assignments
where
there
was
a
retention
of
the
interest
in
the
assignor
and
there's
only
been
one
appellate
decision
that
i
know
of
that
is
restricted,
the
meaning
of
the
word
collusion
to
collusion
between
the
two
sides
of
lawsuit,
and
that
was
judge
biggs'
opinion
for
the
third
circuit
in
the
corabi
case
which
was
later
overruled.
now,
if
this
practice
is
sanctioned
here
--
mr.
dennis
g.lyons
yes
the
whole
line
of
cases
from
1875
through
1910.
i
think,
i
was
flatly
--
mr.
dennis
g.lyons
i
believe
they
are,
your
honor.
and
there
was
no
collusion
between
the
two
sides
of
the
lawsuit
but
the
court
held
that
the
practice
that
the
assignor
and
the
assignee
got
into
was
collusive.
mr.
dennis
g.lyons
i
don't
believe
it
does,
your
honor.
i
think
the
cases
hold
--
the
prior
cases
of
this
court,
that
if
the
parties
are
willing
to
actually
deal
in
this
claim
to
sell
them
from
one
party
to
the
other
so
that
the
party
who
acquires
that
is
the
master
and
the
owner
of
the
claim
and
the
party
who
transfers
no
longer
has
an
interest
in
that
claim.
but
that
is
not
collusive,
that's
an
ordinary
economic
transaction
and
the
cases
draw
the
line
at
that
point.
the
board
of
itself
to
create
the
federal
jurisdiction
isn't
conclusive
and
we
admit
that
--
mr.
dennis
g.lyons
no,
it's
not
your
honor.
if
the
assignor
parts
with
the
interest
in
the
claim,
the
assignor
--
mr.
dennis
g.lyons
that's
correct
if
they
--
if
what
he
has
meant,
that
he
has
to
remit
the
proceedings
about
to
the
assignor.
if
the
assignment
here
created
federal
jurisdiction,
any
cause
of
action
involving
$10,000.00
or
more
which
is
capable
of
being
transferred
under
state
law
and
all
contract
claims
are
all
in
the
lot
of
non-contract
claims
are,
any
such
cause
of
action
can
be
brought
to
the
federal
courts.
simplicity
itself,
the
two
pieces
of
paper
that
will
be
in
the
record
in
this
case
can
be
use
as
they
form
guide,
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
find
another
state
assignee,
assign
the
claim
to
him,
take
his
covenant
back
to
prosecute
the
lawsuit
in
his
covenant
to
pay
--
mr.
dennis
g.lyons
i
would
think
so,
you
probably
want
someone
who
was
under
your
thumb
and
someone
who
you
knew
and
you
wouldn't
have
to
pay
him
5%.
i
think
you
could
pay
him
if
consideration
is
required
you
can
pay
him
1%
or
half
of
1%,
there
would
be
a
competition
in
this
matter,
i
supposed
as
in
all
economic
matters
and
what
we
would
have
would
be
a
universally
available
instant
diversity
jurisdiction.
anyone
could
do
it.
every
lawyer
who
had
a
claim
between
two
parties
of
the
same
state,
i
believe
would
duty-bound
to
consider
whether
he
shouldn't
create
federal
jurisdiction
by
dredging
up
the
clerk
of
out
of
state
citizenship
and
assign
the
claim
to
him
with
set
of
papers
like
that
here.
we
submit
that
there
maybe
some
fussiness
perhaps
in
the
outer
limits
of
what
constitutes
an
improper
and
collusive
assignment
but
we
claim
that
this
assignment
falls
within
the
heart
of
the
statute.
if
any
practice
is
condemned
by
the
statute,
this
practice
must
be.
if
it's
not
condemned
by
the
statute,
the
only
restriction
on
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts
in
contract
matters
or
in
matters
involving
assignable
tort
claims
or
other
assignable
claims,
the
only
limitations
on
the
federal
court
jurisdiction
will
be
the
jurisdictional
amount.
the
considered
--
mr.
dennis
g.lyons
well,
i
think
that
is
probably
still
the
law
there.
you
had
a
case
of
the
assignor
having
been
dissolved
and
to
the
assignor
was
no
longer
in
existence
and
the
court
held
that
since
the
assignor
had
been
dissolved
that
that
was
conclusive.
there
are
early
cases
which
the
court
distinguished
in
black
and
white
which
hold
that
if
the
assignor
is
not
dissolved,
where
you
transfer
the
claim
to
a
corporate
of
another
state
where
the
assignor
is
not
dissolved,
and
remains
in
existence,
there
the
predecessor
of
1359
is
violated
and
there
is
no
federal
court
jurisdiction.
thank
you.
mr.
dennis
g.lyons
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
to
restate
the
facts
of
somewhat
greater
length,
in
the
summer
of
1964
there
were
two
lawyers
in
wichita
falls,
texas,
one
was
mr.
jack
banner,
one
was
mr.
clayton
kramer.
mr.
banner
according
to
the
record
was
briefing
a
legal
point
in
connection
with
a
contract
that
contract
was
the
contract
between
panama
and
venezuela
finance
company
and
caribbean
mills,
inc.
both
of
those
are
alien
corporations.
neither
of
them
could
have
sued
the
other
in
federal
court.
the
contract
under
panama's
view
of
it
was
already
two
years
in
default.
there
were
annual
installment
payments
an
under
panama's
view
three
annual
installment
payments
have
already
gone
by
without
payment
having
been
made.
one
day,
mr.
kramer
and
mr.
banner
met
as
they
had
many
times
in
the
past
and
mr.
banner
said
to
mr.
kramer
that
there
was
a
claim
which
might
be
acquired
obviously
mr.
banner
must
have
gotten
the
claim
from
somewhere
and
that
conversation
which
is
in
the
record
evidently
indicates
an
authority
on
mr.
banner's
part
to
offer
the
claim
to
mr.
kramer.
well,
one
thing
led
to
another
mr.
kramer
by
the
way
knew
nothing
about
the
claim,
he
was
a
perfect
stranger
to
the
transaction,
didn't
know
any
of
the
parties
involved.
somewhere
in
the
shuffle,
mr.
banner
became
mr.
kramer's
lawyer
and
the
parties
sat
down
and
they
prepared
not
one
but
two
legal
documents.
one
of
them
was
an
assignment
of
claim
which
assignment
did
not
refer
to
the
second
document.
the
assignment
reflected
that
the
consideration
was
$1.00
and
other
good
and
valuable
considerations.
the
record
is
clear
that
the
only
money
that
change
hands
was
the
$1.00.
the
other
agreement
is
the
agreement
which
the
petitioner
calls
the
collateral
agreement
for
which
we
called
the
side
agreement
but
actually
the
two
words
means
the
same
thing.
and
in
that
agreement
which
unlike
the
first
agreement
referred
to
the
other
document,
in
that
agreement
there
was
covenant
on
the
part
of
mr.
kramer
to
prosecute
the
claim
to
final
judgment
and
there
was
a
promise
on
mr.
kramer's
part
to
pay
95%
of
the
net
recovery
on
the
claim
back
to
the
assignor,
panama.
now,
even
though
mr.
kramer
in
his
somewhat
difficult
testimony
in
the
transcript
never
admitted
that
the
motive
for
this
transaction
was
to
create
federal
jurisdiction.
counsel
has
admitted
various
times
that
the
motive
and
another
times
a
motive
was
to
create
federal
jurisdiction
and
the
record
suggests
no
other
motive
brought
by
it.
the
parties
then,
mr.
kramer
and
mr.
banner
entered
into
a
contingent
fee
agreement
the
side
agreement
that
mr.
kramer
in
panama
had
entered
into
permitted
mr.
kramer
to
enter
into
contingent
fee
agreements
up
to
33
of
the
30%
and
that
sort
of
arrangement
was
in
fact
entered
into
mr.
banner's
firm
and
six
weeks
later,
there
was
a
suit
filed
in
kramer's
name
in
the
federal
court.
mr.
dennis
g.lyons
yes,
that
comes
of
the
top
and
then
the
5%
slice
comes
out
from
mr.
kramer
and
then
the
other
95%
goes
back
to
panama.
mr.
dennis
g.lyons
of
the
66
and
two-thirds.
mr.
dennis
g.lyons
(inaudible)
mr.
dennis
g.lyons
i
would
think
that
no
impropriety
had
occurred
at
this
time
up
to
the
time
that
the
complaint
was
filed.
now,
when
you
take
single
unitary
transaction
and
put
it
in
two
pieces
of
paper
rather
than
one
that
ended
up
itself
is
not
fraudulent
or
improper.
but
it
certainly
gives
you
the
means
to
commit
an
impropriety
or
to
commit
a
fraud.
mr.
dennis
g.lyons
gives
you
the
means
to
commit
an
impropriety
or
to
commit
a
fraud
because
it
creates
a
situation
in
which
you
can
refer
to
one
document
and
keep
the
other
document
in
your
desk
drawer.
and
in
the
complaint
--
mr.
dennis
g.lyons
i
would
say
that
was.
mr.
dennis
g.lyons
it
is
our
position
that
it
is,
your
honor.
indeed,
it's
our
position
that
even
if
this
was
openly
done
and
of
course
once
the
discovery
procedures
start
working
the
facts
came
out
in
the
open.
but
even
if
this
was
openly
done
that
this
amounts
to
under
the
teachings
of
the
cases
in
this
court
to
an
improper
and
collusive
assignment.
the
complaint
was
then
filed
in
the
federal
court.
the
complaint
alleged
that
panama
had
assigned,
sold,
and
delivered
its
entire
interest
and
rights
in
the
agreement
to
clayton
s.
kramer.
it
didn't
say
a
word
about
the
fact
that
panama
has
a
beneficial
interest
in
95%
of
the
net
recovery.
not
unexpectedly
the
defense
of
the
lawsuit
wondered
somewhat
is
to
how
this
claim
turned
up
in
the
hands
of
the
lawyer
from
wichita
falls
and
mr.
kramer's
deposition
was
taken
and
he
was
asked
on
deposition
series
of
questions
which
are
in
the
record
as
to
how
he
came
to
be
the
owner
of
the
claim
and
he
declined
to
answer
all
those
questions.
he
declined
to
answer
questions
as
to
the
existence
of
agreements
between
him
and
panama
apart
from
the
face
of
the
assignment.
and
finally,
an
order
of
the
court
was
obtained
and
the
collateral
agreement
was
produced
in
response
to
the
order
of
the
court.
mr.
dennis
g.lyons
simply
on
the
advice
of
counsel.
the
central
question
in
this
case
is
whether
section
1359
of
the
judicial
code
bars
the
manufacturer.
the
manufacture
then
said
religiously,
the
petitioners
were
not
ours.
it
bars
the
manufacturer
of
the
diversity
jurisdiction
of
the
case
like
this.
this
report
held
no
that
the
only
relevant
consideration
was
to
look
to
the
face
of
the
assignment
and
not
to
look
to
the
other
factors.
the
court
of
appeals
said
yes.
the
essentials
as
we
see
it
of
the
arrangement
or
scheme
that
was
employed
here
are
four
in
number.
you
of
course
start
with
two
parties.
it
could
not
sue
each
other
in
the
federal
court,
sometimes
two
aliens,
sometimes
its
two
citizens
of
the
same
state.
and
the
four
factors
as
we
see
them
or
first
that
you
have
a
voluntarily
assignment
of
the
claim,
this
is
not
a
case
involving
an
executor
or
a
guardian
where
you
have
to
have
fiduciary
in
order
to
prosecute
a
claim.
this
is
a
voluntarily
assignment
of
the
claim.
it's
an
assignment
made
after
the
dispute
arose.
here,
there
were
three
annual
payments
which
allegedly
under
the
plaintiff's
theory
were
in
default.
the
third
factor
is
that
a
motive
is
to
create
or
manufacture
diversity
jurisdiction.
and
the
fourth
factor
is
the
assign
--
that
the
assignor
retains
a
beneficial
ownership
in
the
claim.
now,
in
1875
when
the
diversity
of
citizenship,
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts
was
enlarged
there
was
enacted
by
congress
a
protective
statute
which
provided
in
substantially
the
same
language
as
present
section
1359
that
the
federal
courts
would
not
have
jurisdiction
where
a
party
was
made
or
added
through
assignment
or
otherwise,
improperly
or
collusively
in
order
to
create
federal
jurisdiction.
and
in
the
35
years
after
that
statute
was
passed,
there
was
a
whole
string
of
cases,
which
came
before
this
court
which
involved
these
four
elements.
they
involved
the
assignment,
the
assignment
made
after
the
dispute
arose,
the
motive
to
create
federal
jurisdiction,
and
the
retention
of
the
beneficial
interest
in
the
claim
by
the
assignor.
that
last
is
of
course
an
important
factor.
there
are
another
line
of
cases
uphold
that
where
the
assignment
is
in
fact
absolute
where
a
party
buys
a
claim,
pays
money
for
it,
and
the
assignor
has
no
further
interest
in
the
outcome
of
a
litigation
that
you
may
then
look
at
the
assignee's
citizenship
for
the
purpose
of
determining
diversity
jurisdiction
but
this
case
is
not
on
that
side
of
the
line.
mr.
kramer
here
had
been
willing
to
make
an
evaluation
of
the
claim,
pay
money
for
it
and
in
effect
be
quits
with
panama
and
leave
panama
with
no
interest
whatsoever
in
this
claim.
the
case
has
seem
to
teach
that
that
sort
of
assignment
is
not
improper
or
collusive
but
this
line
of
cases
which
we
review
at
pages
14
to
18
of
our
brief,
which
were
decided
in
the
years
immediately
after
the
passage
of
this
statute
hold
that
where
the
assignor
has
retained
the
beneficial
interest
in
the
claim
and
the
beneficial
interest
in
these
cases
vary
some
cases.
it's
a
100%
other
cases
it
was
a
less
than
a
100%
and
the
assignee
like
mr.
kramer
here
was
given
a
percentage
for
the
use
of
his
name.
but
these
cases
hold
that
that
constitutes
an
improper
or
collusive
assignment
and
they
used
the
words
improper
or
collusive
and
applied
this
concept
of
collusion
to
this
arrangement
between
at
least
two
parties
even
though
these
are
not
two
parties
on
different
sides
of
the
lawsuits.
mr.
dennis
g.lyons
he
undertook
to
prosecute
the
claim.
mr.
dennis
g.lyons
yes.
mr.
dennis
g.lyons
no,
he
didn't.
he
couldn't
walk
away
from
this.
mr.
dennis
g.lyons
well,
if
he
had
acquired
full
title
to
the
claim,
there'd
be
no
reason
for
him
to
promise
to
--
mr.
dennis
g.lyons
well,
that's
true.
in
full
title
to
a
zero
claim
is
not
a
--
mr.
dennis
g.lyons
that's
right.
there
is
--
mr.
dennis
g.lyons
there's
no
reason
of
partition
an
empty
five
place.
it's
only
for
five
up
here
in
this
place
in
the
form
of
a
judgment
that
there'd
be
any
reason
to
cut
it
up.
mr.
dennis
g.lyons
he'd
have
5%
percent
of
the
net
recovery.
mr.
dennis
g.lyons
well,
if
he
and
the
assignor
had
joined
together
and
sued,
they
wouldn't
have
been
in
diversity
because
the
statute
does
not
cover
that,
that
sort
of
a
suit.
the
petitioner
seeks
to
distinguish
this
line
of
cases
in
this
court,
which
construed
the
statute.
on
the
three
bases,
first
they
point
to
the
effect
of
the
1948
codification.
they
--
mr.
justice,
i
believe
mr.
gressman
might
have
this
morning
that
the
assignee
clause
from
the
1789
statute
have
something
to
do
with
this.
actually,
it
did
not.
the
statute
that's
presently
on
the
books,
according
to
the
reviser's
notes
and
according
to
its
language,
a
codification
to
bring
forward
of
the
1875
statute
which
is
the
statute
under
which
this
line
of
cases
was
decided,
and
the
reviser's
notes,
even
though
they
dropped
certain
of
the
language,
the
language
that
was
dropped
was
not
the
language
relied
upon
by
the
court
in
this
old
line
of
cases.
and
the
reviser's
notes
indicate
that
the
desire
was
to
carry
forward
the
1875
act.
under
those
circumstances,
we
submit
that
the
revision
does
not
change
the
value
of
prior
cases.
the
statute
always
have
said
on
proper
or
collusive
and
this
has
been
construed
to
cover
caces
where
the
only
collusion
is
this
relationship
between
the
assignor
and
the
assignee
in
which
the
assignor
still
has
the
interest
in
the
claim.
then,
the
cases
that
sought
to
be
distinguished
on
the
grounds
that
here,
there
was
a
transfer
of
title
which
was
good
under
state
law.
well,
this
is
not
a
state
law
issue.
the
question
here
is
not
whether
mr.
kramer
could
have
brought
this
suit
in
a
state
court,
i
assume
he
couldn't.
i
sometimes
wonder
why
he
didn't.
the
question
here
is
whether
the
federal
standards
of
improper
or
collusive
if
the
clause
had
been
put
on
them
by
the
earlier
cases
on
what
that
standard
means.
in
fact,
in
a
number
of
those
cases,
the
court
seems
to
have
commented
or
to
have
assumed
that
the
assignment
was
good
under
state
law.
finally,
there
is
a
lengthy
suggestion
in
the
brief
that
somehow
even
though
this
might
not
be
good
in
the
case
of
an
assignment
where
the
real
parties
and
interest
are
citizens
of
the
same
state,
that
the
court
should
be
more
lenient
or
more
tolerant
with
respect
to
this
matter
where
the
real
party
and
interests
are
two
aliens.
i
must
confess
i'm
somewhat
unable
to
follow
this
--
mr.
dennis
g.lyons
that's
certainly
one
of
the
tests,
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
g.lyons
that's
right.
mr.
dennis
g.lyons
well,
if
he
lost
there
was
nothing
to
return.
he
owned
the
whole
claim
of
the
loss
but
--
mr.
dennis
g.lyons
no,
i
say
you
have
at
the
your
honor
that
you
have
to
look
at
the
matter
as
the
suit
is
brought
and
as
the
suit
is
brought,
he
might
win,
he
might
lose
the
reason
he
is
bringing
the
suit
was
with
the
desire
to
win.
mr.
dennis
g.lyons
that's
right.
mr.
dennis
g.lyons
that
factor
with
the
other
factors,
the
motive
to
create
federal
jurisdiction
--
mr.
dennis
g.lyons
--
which
--
mr.
dennis
g.lyons
which
when
taken
with
other
factors
this
court
has
held
are
to
involve
impropriety
and
collusion.
the
--
none
of
these
factors
standing
alone
might
give
us
a
case
of
impropriety
and
collusion
but
i
think
from
the
analysis
of
the
early
cases
that
the
early
cases
all
have
these
four
factors.
they
have
a
motive,
they
have
the
assignment,
they
have
the
fact
that
the
assignment
is
made
after
the
parties
have
fallen
into
dispute
and
it
appears
that
there
will
be
litigation,
and
they
have
the
retention
of
the
interest
by
the
assignor.
mr.
dennis
g.lyons
i
don't
know
if
caribbean
brought
for
the
5%.
i
think
probably,
i
have
been
barred
by
the
rule
against
splitting
a
cause
of
action.
what
you
have
here
is
the
unitary
claim
and
i
think
the
defendant
is
entitled
not
to
be
sued
piecemeal
by
a
number
of
--
mr.
dennis
g.lyons
well,
your
honor
i
think
there
is
a
rule
of
law
under
state
law
that,
if
you
have
the
unitary
obligation
to
pay
money
for
someone
that
that
person
can't
break
it
up
into
a
150
bits
and
then
face
you
with
a
hundred
plaintiffs
in
the
lawsuits.
and
i
think
this
unitary
cause
of
action
and
one
party
has
to
sue
on
it
and
these
papers
purport
to
vest
the
legal
title
in
him
and
interstate
court,
he
could
brought
this
suit.
and
titus
v.
wallick
holds
that
one
state
–-
if
a
state
permits
this
sort
of
suit
to
be
brought
under
this
sort
of
this
assignment,
i
supposed
most
state
courts
would
but
another
state
has
to
give
a
full
faith
in
credit
to
that
judgment
that
is
all
the
titus
v.
wallick
holds,
there's
nothing
to
do
with
the
(voice
overlap).
mr.
dennis
g.lyons
i
think
we
could
either
move
in
the
alternative
that
it
be
dismissed
on
the
basis
that
it's
the
splitting
of
the
cause
of
action
or
that
unnecessary
party
is
not
been
joined
and
of
course
once
the
necessary
parties
joined
the
case
is
no
longer
within
the
diversity
statute.
mr.
dennis
g.lyons
i
think
they
are
--
they
may
have
different
meanings
your
honor,
courts
have
use
them
both
that
they
have
held
that
where
you
have
a
--
these
factors
that
the
assignment
is
collusive
and
improper.
the
statute
uses
them
in
the
disjunction
instead
it
has
an
“or”
in
it.
but
we
would
say
that
this
was
both
collusive
in
the
sense
of
involving
this
relationship
between
the
two
parties
to
the
assignment
whereby
the
assignor
was
ousted
of
his
interest
and
it
is
improper
in
the
sense
that
it
is
not
a
proper
way
to
create
federal
jurisdiction.
now
--
mr.
dennis
g.lyons
i
supposed
so
and
whether
making
assertion
that
complaint
was
made
--
mr.
dennis
g.lyons
well
then
i
suspect
that
the
--
if
there
hadn't
been
any
effort
to
conceal
it
here,
i
would
agree.
but
i
think
the
result
is
the
same
whether
or
not
there
had
been
the
effort
to
conceal
it.
mr.
dennis
g.lyons
that
it
means
a
device
which
is
made
from
the
motive
of
creating
federal
jurisdiction
and
which
does
not
oust
the
assignor
of
his
interest
of
the
claim.
now,
--
mr.
dennis
g.lyons
i've
studied,
your
honor
from
the
prior
cases
of
the
court
which
involved
assignments
where
there
was
a
retention
of
the
interest
in
the
assignor
and
there's
only
been
one
appellate
decision
that
i
know
of
that
is
restricted,
the
meaning
of
the
word
collusion
to
collusion
between
the
two
sides
of
lawsuit,
and
that
was
judge
biggs'
opinion
for
the
third
circuit
in
the
corabi
case
which
was
later
overruled.
now,
if
this
practice
is
sanctioned
here
--
mr.
dennis
g.lyons
yes
the
whole
line
of
cases
from
1875
through
1910.
i
think,
i
was
flatly
--
mr.
dennis
g.lyons
i
believe
they
are,
your
honor.
and
there
was
no
collusion
between
the
two
sides
of
the
lawsuit
but
the
court
held
that
the
practice
that
the
assignor
and
the
assignee
got
into
was
collusive.
mr.
dennis
g.lyons
i
don't
believe
it
does,
your
honor.
i
think
the
cases
hold
--
the
prior
cases
of
this
court,
that
if
the
parties
are
willing
to
actually
deal
in
this
claim
to
sell
them
from
one
party
to
the
other
so
that
the
party
who
acquires
that
is
the
master
and
the
owner
of
the
claim
and
the
party
who
transfers
no
longer
has
an
interest
in
that
claim.
but
that
is
not
collusive,
that's
an
ordinary
economic
transaction
and
the
cases
draw
the
line
at
that
point.
the
board
of
itself
to
create
the
federal
jurisdiction
isn't
conclusive
and
we
admit
that
--
mr.
dennis
g.lyons
no,
it's
not
your
honor.
if
the
assignor
parts
with
the
interest
in
the
claim,
the
assignor
--
mr.
dennis
g.lyons
that's
correct
if
they
--
if
what
he
has
meant,
that
he
has
to
remit
the
proceedings
about
to
the
assignor.
if
the
assignment
here
created
federal
jurisdiction,
any
cause
of
action
involving
$10,000.00
or
more
which
is
capable
of
being
transferred
under
state
law
and
all
contract
claims
are
all
in
the
lot
of
non-contract
claims
are,
any
such
cause
of
action
can
be
brought
to
the
federal
courts.
simplicity
itself,
the
two
pieces
of
paper
that
will
be
in
the
record
in
this
case
can
be
use
as
they
form
guide,
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
find
another
state
assignee,
assign
the
claim
to
him,
take
his
covenant
back
to
prosecute
the
lawsuit
in
his
covenant
to
pay
--
mr.
dennis
g.lyons
i
would
think
so,
you
probably
want
someone
who
was
under
your
thumb
and
someone
who
you
knew
and
you
wouldn't
have
to
pay
him
5%.
i
think
you
could
pay
him
if
consideration
is
required
you
can
pay
him
1%
or
half
of
1%,
there
would
be
a
competition
in
this
matter,
i
supposed
as
in
all
economic
matters
and
what
we
would
have
would
be
a
universally
available
instant
diversity
jurisdiction.
anyone
could
do
it.
every
lawyer
who
had
a
claim
between
two
parties
of
the
same
state,
i
believe
would
duty-bound
to
consider
whether
he
shouldn't
create
federal
jurisdiction
by
dredging
up
the
clerk
of
out
of
state
citizenship
and
assign
the
claim
to
him
with
set
of
papers
like
that
here.
we
submit
that
there
maybe
some
fussiness
perhaps
in
the
outer
limits
of
what
constitutes
an
improper
and
collusive
assignment
but
we
claim
that
this
assignment
falls
within
the
heart
of
the
statute.
if
any
practice
is
condemned
by
the
statute,
this
practice
must
be.
if
it's
not
condemned
by
the
statute,
the
only
restriction
on
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts
in
contract
matters
or
in
matters
involving
assignable
tort
claims
or
other
assignable
claims,
the
only
limitations
on
the
federal
court
jurisdiction
will
be
the
jurisdictional
amount.
the
considered
--
mr.
dennis
g.lyons
well,
i
think
that
is
probably
still
the
law
there.
you
had
a
case
of
the
assignor
having
been
dissolved
and
to
the
assignor
was
no
longer
in
existence
and
the
court
held
that
since
the
assignor
had
been
dissolved
that
that
was
conclusive.
there
are
early
cases
which
the
court
distinguished
in
black
and
white
which
hold
that
if
the
assignor
is
not
dissolved,
where
you
transfer
the
claim
to
a
corporate
of
another
state
where
the
assignor
is
not
dissolved,
and
remains
in
existence,
there
the
predecessor
of
1359
is
violated
and
there
is
no
federal
court
jurisdiction.
thank
you.
