mr.
eugene
gressman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
and
raises
the
general
question
of
whether
federal
diversity
jurisdiction
can
be
created
by
a
lawful
assignment
of
a
contract
or
a
money
claim
to
a
plaintiff.
more
specifically,
the
question
is
whether
the
assignment
of
a
contract
or
a
money
claim
is
improper
or
collusive
within
the
meaning
of
section
1359
of
the
judicial
code
where
the
assignment
itself
is
legal
under
state
law,
where
one
motive
or
the
assignment
is
to
gain
access
to
the
federal
court
like
creating
diversity
of
citizenship
specified
in
section
1330
(a)
(2).
and
thirdly,
where
part
of
the
consideration
or
the
transaction
was
a
percentage
of
the
recovery
obtained
on
the
assigned
claim.
now
counsel
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
yes,
your
honor.
it's
solely
a
federal
question
as
to
whether
the
court
itself
has
jurisdiction
or
whether
it
has
lost
jurisdiction.
mr.
eugene
gressman
yes,
your
honor.
now
counsel
as
candidly
conceded
and
the
court
below
and
we
repeated
to
this
court
while
it
is
not
a
matter
of
the
record
but
one
of
the
major
motives
in
the
establishment
of
this
transaction
was
a
desire
or
the
to
create
the
basis
for
invoking
the
diversity
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
district
court.
now
that
motivation
however,
has
to
be
viewed
in
light
of
the
realities
of
the
situation
that
was
confronting
the
various
parties
in
this
case.
now
the
brief
where
the
respondent
has
sought
to
paint
a
rather
bleak
and
sinister
picture
of
the
events
in
this
case
that
i
suggest
are
not
justified
by
the
record
and
certainly
not
by
the
facts
as
we
know
them,
there
was
no
senator
or
secret
efforts
made
to
defraud
any
party
or
to
secrete
any
documents
from
the
court
or
from
anyone
else.
what
happened
in
this
case
of
course
as
we
see
it
is
a
classic
illustration
of
a
desire
to
avoid
what
one
of
these
parties
the
panama
and
venezuela
finance
company
viewed
as
prejudice
in
the
state
courts
and
to
avoid
that
prejudice
or
possibility
of
prejudice
is
really
the
constitutional
raise
on
debtor
of
federal
diversity
jurisdiction.
the
major,
indeed
the
sole
justification
that
has
ever
been
suggested
for
diversity
jurisdiction
is
to
permit
state
causes
of
action
to
bid,
tried
and
heard
in
the
federal
courts
where
the
parties
have
any
choice
in
the
matter
for
one
reason
or
another
may
fear
or
some
degree
or
some
element
of
prejudice
may
follow
them
if
they
invoke
the
jurisdiction
of
the
state
court
rather
than
the
federal
court.
mr.
eugene
gressman
that
is
right,
your
honor.
mr.
eugene
gressman
right,
it's
an
alien
corporation.
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
i
think
you
have
first
to
look
back
to
the
original
situation
under
which
this
arose.
the
original
situation
you
will
recall
was
essentially
a
contract
entered
into
in
1959
between
two
alien
corporations
in
effect
whereby
the
caribbean
mills
the
respondent
here
agreed
to
pay
over
a
period
of
years
$165,000.00
to
panama
and
venezuela
finance
company
which
was
also
an
alien
corporation
having
been
incorporated
in
panama.
now,
when
several
years
later
caribbean
mills
defaulted
on
that
contract
and
indeed
repudiated
the
contract,
panama
finance
company
was
faced
with
a
situation
out
of
which
this
whole
transaction
arose
to
with
panama
could
not
have
sued
caribbean
mills
in
the
federal
court
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
both
were
aliens.
now,
the
only
recourse
panama
had
to
a
court
action
was
to
sue
presumably
in
haiti
or
in
the
texas
state
court.
now
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
that
is
right,
your
honor
more
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
that
is
right,
it
is
more
than
that
your
honor
it
actively
doing
business
in
the
state
of
texas
and
they
raise
this
point
and
it
was
decided
against
them
that
they
had
adequate
contacts
with
the
state
to
permit
service
and
a
suit
in
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
court
in
texas.
mr.
eugene
gressman
well
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
yes.
your
honor
this
was
the
practical
situation
facing
them
as
i
say
the
defendant
corporation
the
caribbean
mills
corporation
while
it
was
technically
and
legally
a
citizen
of
haiti,
an
alien
was
also
owned
a
dominated
by
the
murchison
family
in
dallas,
texas.
most
of
the
officers
of
the
company
resided
in
dallas
and
did
--
it
actively
did
corporate
business
there,
clint
murchison
was
one
of
the
witnesses
in
this
case
testified
and
frankly
they
feared
that
this
was
more
than
simply
an
alien
defendant,
this
was
one
of
the
classic
instances
of
where
they
feared
that
a
--
it
would
been
impossible
to
overcome
the
local
kind
of
prejudice
that
does
ensue
in
these
situations
where
you
have
a
dominant
local
interest
involved
on
the
defendant
side.
plus
the
fact
that
they
were
a
finance
companies
in
addition
to
being
an
alien
here
are
notoriously
poorer
risk
as
a
plaintiff
attempting
to
secure
a
money
judgments.
mr.
eugene
gressman
i
think
they
feared
that,
yes.
mr.
eugene
gressman
yes,
it
was
your
honor.
mr.
eugene
gressman
drawn
from
the
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
right.
mr.
eugene
gressman
right.
but
you
have
a
broader
selection
in
the
federal
court
i
suppose
and
you
--
not
17
counties
i
think
are
involved
in
the
federal
court
whereas
the
state
court
would
have
been
the
local
precinct
or
local
city
anyway.
but
in
any
event
they
tried
to
realize
that
in
their
own
hands
this
claim
wasn't
worth
very
much
and
they
were
actively
seeking
to
sell
this
claim
to
a
various
numbers
of
persons
at
a
discount.
i
think
at
one
time
they
tried
to
sell
it
for
$25,000.00
and
nobody
would
take
and
they
eventually
came
to
mr.
banner,
an
attorney
in
texas
and
ask
him
if
he
would
be
interested
in
purchasing
this
and
he
said
no.
looking
into
it
he
then
contacted
another
attorney,
mr.
kramer
the
plaintiff
in
this
case
and
ask
if
he
would
be
interested
in
purchasing
or
arranging
to
take
over
this
claim.
now,
the
respondent
claims
that
somehow
mr.
banner
was
sort
of
a
double
agent
here
acting
as
an
attorney
for
panama
as
well
as
for
mr.
kramer.
far
from
that
he
has
never
acted
at
anytime
as
the
attorney
for
panama
has
never
receive
a
cent
from
it
and
has
treated
them
at
arm's-length
at
all
time
so
that
whatever
concern
or
connection
mr.
banner
had
with
the
case
does
not
reflect
upon
panama's
interest
or
lack
of
interest
in
this
situation.
in
any
event
when
mr.
kramer
became
interested
in
this
and
purely
for
profit
motives
frankly,
the
problem
arose
just
to,
how
they
could
arrange
a
transaction
that
would
be
lawful
and
that
would
permit
adequate
consideration
and
what
have
you
to
be
arranged.
now,
the
testimony
that
mr.
kramer
gave
at
the
trial
to
be
frankly
said
he
didn't
have
a
$165,000.00,
he
didn't
have
a
hundred
thousand
dollars
to
pay
for
this
claim,
nor
did
he
have
the
facilities
to
obtain
a
bank
loan
for
this.
so
after
discussing
this
at
some
length
with
his
then
attorney
mr.
banner
they
came
to
a
conclusion
that
maybe
we
can
have
some
sort
of
the
deferred
type
of
consideration
let's
call
it
a
bonus.
let's
call
it
anything
else
to
be
payable
out
of
whatever
you
may
be
able
to
get
from
a
lawsuit
recovered
as
a
result
of
an
assignment
of
the
claim
to
mr.
kramer
and
that
is
exactly
what
happened.
it
was
then
arranged
to
have
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
pardon?
mr.
eugene
gressman
well
that
was
part
of
it,
yes
but
that
was
not
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
that
was
not
in
mr.
kramer
was
not
receiving
that
as
a
lawyer,
he
--
in
fact,
he
is
a
lawyer
but
he
was
not
acting
as
a
lawyer
in
this
case
mr.
banner
was
his
lawyer
at
all
times
but
they
did
arrange
this
through
first
of
all
an
assignment
in
a
piece
of
paper
which
in
unequivocal
terms
stated
that
panama
finance
company
hereby
assigns,
conveys,
transfers
all
of
its
interests
including
causes
of
action
and
claims
under
this
1959
contract
to
mr.
clayton
s.
kramer
for
$1.00
and
other
adequate
or
valuable
consideration
receipt
whereof
is
hereby
acknowledged.
now,
that
by
concession
and
by
all
applicable
law
universally
recognized
was
a
complete
bona
fide
and
unexceptional
transfer
of
all
of
panama's
interest
in
this
contract.
standing
by
itself
it
was
adequate
under
state
law
to
permit
the
cause
of
action
to
be
brought
by
mr.
kramer
as
the
complete
and
full
assignee
of
this
contract
and
of
this
cause
of
action.
it
was
unnecessary
to
have
anything
else
proved
or
shown
or
executed
in
order
to
create
a
complete
and
lawful
assignment
but
to
arrange
more
of
this
deferred
--
lucky
considered
being
deferred
consideration
if
you
will
that
entered
into
simultaneously
without
any
secret,
without
any
collusion
or
devious
motivations
or
actions
into
the
so-called
collateral
agreement.
it
wasn't
pleaded
in
the
case
because
it
didn't
have
to
be.
all
he
had
to
plead
in
the
complaint
was
that
he
was
an
assignee
under
this
first
and
original
document
of
assignment.
the
assignment
or
the
collateral
agreement
completely
reaffirmed
the
assignment
and
made
claim
what
was
already
implicit
that
panama
had
given
up
complete
control
over
the
lawsuit
or
any
lawsuit
that
kramer
might
bring.
kramer
had
complete
control
and
management
of
that
suit
and
it
also
provided
for
this
provision
for
the
so-called
bonus
or
the
consideration
of
95%
of
the
net
recovery
which
would
then
go
back
out
of
any
recovery
mr.
kramer
might
receive
from
his
lawsuit.
mr.
eugene
gressman
no,
your
honor.
no,
there
is
no
identity
of
lawyers
among
any
of
these
parties.
mr.
eugene
gressman
that
was
mr.
banner
who
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
no,
he
only
has
represented
mr.
kramer.
mr.
eugene
gressman
mr.
harrell
i
believe
who
was
counsel
for
the
caribbean
mills,
yes.
mr.
eugene
gressman
he
did
not
have
caribbean's
lawyer,
he
did
not
have
panama's
lawyer.
he
had
his
own
lawyer.
mr.
eugene
gressman
the
suggestion
has
been
made
by
the
respondent
but
is
completely
aside
from
the
facts
and
not
accurate
to
say
that
because
mr.
banner
who
is
mr.
kramer's
attorney
was
somehow
acting
on
behalf
of
panama
and
all
this
but
that
is
not
true.
panama
had
a
lawyer,
a
firm
new
york
city
all
times.
they
never
got
into
this
litigation
of
course
but
they
had
their
separate
lawyers
and
mr.
banner
dealt
at
arm's-length
with
that
law
firm
in
the
execution
of
these
documents.
now
it
seems
to
me
that
it
becomes
crystal
clear
that
the
critical
fact
therefore
in
this
case
is
that
the
assignment
itself
was
absolute,
complete,
and
bona
fide
and
indeed
there's
no
dispute
about
that
as
i
see
it
that
all
of
panama's
interest
were
thereby
transferred
and
as
a
result
of
the
assignment
instrument,
panama
had
no
claim,
no
right
under
that
contract,
no
cause
of
action,
no
control
over
the
lawsuit
that
ensued
and
concededly
this
was
proper
under
the
applicable
law
of
texas
and
that
the
law
of
any
other
state
in
the
united
states
to
effectuate
a
complete
transfer
of
all
of
panama's
interest.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
read
however,
the
collateral
agreement
provision
of
the
95%
bonus
as
indicated
that
somehow
panama
retained
some
sort
of
a
beneficial
interest
to
our
in
this
cause
of
action
or
in
the
contract
claim.
now,
while
this
was
conceded
by
the
parties
as
a
legitimate
forum
or
deferred
consideration,
it
is
i
suppose
possible
to
read
this
as
some
sort
of
a
beneficial
interest
of
one
sort
of
another
or
perhaps
an
assignment
or
collection
on
behalf
of
panama.
but
the
worst
or
the
least
can
be
said
about
this
transaction
with
respect
to
the
95%
interest
which
was
to
be
returned
to
panama
was
that
this
was
an
assignment
or
collection
which
is
one
of
the
most
common
transactions
lawful
transactions
that
is
performed
almost
everyday
in
the
business
world
which
gives
the
assignee
complete
control,
complete
domination,
complete
title
of
whatever
is
assigned
to
him
for
collection
and
makes
the
assignee
the
real
per
diem
interest
to
bring
the
suit
and
despite
the
fact
that
he
is
suppose
to
return
part
of
that
recovery
or
all
of
the
recovery
even
in
some
cases
back
to
the
assignor,
it
does
not
make
the
assignment
itself
any
less
complete,
any
less
lawful
and
is
certainly
does
not
make
the
transaction
itself
collusive
under
any
recognized
meaning
of
those
phrases.
it
is
well-established
in
the
law
that
an
assignment
that
shows
an
action
constitutes
the
assignee,
the
proper
party
an
interest
to
sue
even
though
the
instrument
of
assignment
recites,
which
this
one
did
not,
that
the
transfer
is
merely
for
purposes
of
suit
and
obligates
the
assignee
to
account
for
the
proceeds
to
another
person
and
indeed
this
court's
decision
in
titus
versus
wallick
in
306
volume
of
the
united
states
reports
at
282,
is
the
leading
authority
on
the
validity
of
this
kind
of
an
arrangement
and
the
court
there
said
that
under
the,
it
happen
to
be
in
new
york
transaction
there
that
the
repeated
decisions
of
new
york
and
it
could
be
said
of
any
other
state,
it
is
long
been
settled
that
an
assignment
which
purports
to
assign
or
transfer
or
shows
of
action
confers
upon
the
transferee
such
title
and
ownership
as
will
enable
him
to
sue
upon
it.
this
is
true
even
though
the
assignment
is
for
the
purpose
of
suit
only
and
the
transferee
is
obligated
to
account
for
the
proceeds
of
the
suit
to
his
assignor.
and
more
importantly,
and
this
was
the
opinion
written
by
justice
stone.
it
is
evident
that
through
to
this
kind
of
a
transaction
no
fraud
was
perpetrated
upon
the
other
party
or
upon
the
new
york
courts
if
the
assignment
of
the
claim
operated
to
this
in
the
assignee,
such
ownership
or
interest
in
the
claim
was
it
would
enable
him
to
maintain
the
suit
upon
it
there.
mr.
eugene
gressman
no
that
--
well
not
truly
a
diversity
case
in
that
sense
but
it
was
a
full
faith
in
credit
they
had
made
a
--
the
assignee
had
obtained
a
judgment
in
new
york,
which
was
subsequently
attack
in
ohio
as
being
fraudulently
obtained.
and
this
court
says,
“not
at
all
that
there
had
been
no
fraud
perpetrated
by
virtue
of
making
an
assignment
for
collection
only
and
that
this
was
a
perfectly
legitimate
and
lawful
transaction.”
now
we
have
to
therefore
apply
the
language
of
259
to
this
arraignment
which
i
have
described.
and
i
think
it's
very
instructive
to
note
that
1359
of
course
was
created
as
a
part
of
the
1948
revision
of
the
judicial
code.
and
prior
to
1948
we
had
on
the
books
from
the
beginning
of
our
statutes
as
a
matter
in
1789.
the
so-called
anti-assignment
statute
which
was
very
simple
in
its
concept
and
that
was
that
if
the
original
parties
doing
the
transaction
did
not
have
adequate
diversity
or
did
it,
were
unable
to
bring
suit
in
the
federal
court.
you
could
not
by
assignment
create
any
different
result
in
other
words
the
assignee
was
absolutely
bound
by
the
jurisdictional
situation
created
by
the
original
parties
and
you
could
not
change
that.
that
became
incrusted
with
a
lot
of
exceptions
and
a
legislative
jargon
which
made
it
and
also
barred
the
good
assignments
and
the
bad
assignments
as
long
as
the
original
parties
couldn't
sue
and
the
assignee
could
never
bring
an
action.
so
they
decided
to
eliminate
that
provision
completely
and
to
adopt
rather
the
concept
developed
under
the
1875
statute
have
bind
any
kind
of
a
transfer
or
device
which
would
collusively
or
improperly
make
as
a
party
plaintiff
any
individual
where
the
intent
was
to
create
or
invoke
federal
court
jurisdiction.
and
the
revisers
of
the
judicial
code
made
it
very
plain
that
they
were
cutting
down
on
the
assignment
scope
of
the
--
what
you
might
call
the
anti-assignment
statute
by
confining
its
application
to
cases
wherein
the
assignment
is
improperly
or
collusively
made
to
invoke
jurisdiction.
and
they
made
it
clear
that
there
was
no
dispute
about
this
that
the
revisers
meant
to
apply
the
long
established
principles
of
the
1875
statute
to
assignments
and
what
are
those
principles.
well,
the
first
place
it's
clear
that
not
all
assignments
and
not
all
transfers
designed
to
evoke
diversity
jurisdiction
are
outlawed
nor
do
they
divest
the
federal
court
of
jurisdiction.
only
those
that
result
from
a
collusive
or
improper
action
in
establishing
the
party
plaintiff,
many
people
including
many
commentators
seemed
to
think
that
in
1359
bars
all
assignments
that
create
diversity
jurisdiction.
that
simply
is
not
the
way
the
statute
agrees.
mr.
eugene
gressman
that's
one
way
it
could
has
an
absolute
assignment
of
5%
to
mr.
kramer.
mr.
eugene
gressman
no,
i
don't
know
if
there's
any
that
you'd
define
impropriety
or
collusiveness
in
terms
of
the
percent
of
what
is
absolutely
conveyed
or
what
is
beneficially
conveyed.
if
it's
conceded
once
that
you
can
sign
simply
for
collection
only
which
is
done
all
the
time
and
makes
it
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
eugene
gressman
because
it's
for
collection
only
as
i
understand
that
that
has
consistently
been
held
to
make
the
assignee
for
the
collection
only
as
distinguished
from
an
agent
for
collection
only.
mr.
eugene
gressman
well
i
think
that
the
leading
case
that
that
cited
continuously
is
the
titus
v.
wallick
which
is
not
a
1359
case.
mr.
eugene
gressman
i
don't
think
there
is
any
leading
authority
that
that
mentions
this
in
terms
of
1359
although
there
are
some,
your
honor
that
do
--
the
lower
courts
to
having
made
that
point
that
this
makes
the
assignee
for
collection
only
a
proper
party
and
interest
also
says
it
is
not
collusive
under
1359
there
are
some
now
those
are
not
cited.
i
would
be
glad
to
submit
those
too,
your
honor.
there
all
lower
court
opinions
and
i'm
simply
saying
there
is
no
leading
authority
and
certainly
this
court
in
fact
has
never
had
occasion
to
deal
with
the
problem
of
assignments
under
1359
since
it
was
revised
in
1948.
but
i
would
be
glad
to
submit
that
just
a
list
of
the
cases
to,
your
honor
where
that
has
been
held
by
lower
courts.
now,
the
basic
doctrine
that
was
established
and
created
by
these
pre-revision
cases
and
other
types
of
transfers
then
assignments
was
that
a
transfer
was
not
improper
or
collusive
if
it
was
real
rather
than
a
colorable
one.
and
in
fact
operated
to
transfer
all
the
transferors
interest
and
we
submit
that
by
concession
and
that
by
law
and
by
fact
that
requirement
has
here
been
satisfied
by
the
absolute
character
of
the
assignment
to
mr.
kramer
regardless
of
whether
you
conceal
--
conceive
of
that
assignment
as
one
for
collection
of
all
or
some
or
an
absolute
assignment
period.
if
the
transfer
was
lawful
and
complete
as
it
was
here
then
we
submit
that
the
cases
in
this
court
make
it
absolutely
clear
that
the
fact
that
the
transaction
was
motivated
and
designed
by
a
desire
to
create
or
to
utilize
federal
diversity
jurisdiction
becomes
completely
irrelevant.
this
court
has
said
time
and
again
and
this
pre-revision
cases
that
motive
per
se
cannot
invalidate
or
make
collusive
or
improper
a
transaction
that
is
lawful
and
bona
fide
and
result
in
a
complete
transfer
of
legal
title
to
whatever
is
being
transferred.
mr.
eugene
gressman
that
idea
has
been
expressed
by
chief
judge
biggs
in
the
corabi
decision
in
the
third
circuit
which
is
cited
in
our
brief.
and
it's
been
criticized
by
others
that
it
may
not
necessarily
have
to
be
between
the
plaintiff
and
defendant.
it
may
be
many
people
claim
and
this
is
what
the
court
here
and
this
circuit
here
held
it
was
a
collusion,
i
assume,
between
the
assignor
and
the
assignee
in
order
to
permit
the
assignees
to
bring
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
well
that
is
it,
your
honor
it
seems
to
me
that
you
have
to
give
some
content
and
meaningful
content
to
the
words
collusion
or
impropriety.
congress
didn't
use
these
words
inadvisably
they
didn't
mean
to
say
every
time
there
is
a
motive
to
create
jurisdiction
you
have
a
collusive
arrangement.
those
are
not
equivalents
and
it
seems
to
me
that
chief
judge
biggs
in
the
seeking
to
define
and
he
has
done
the
major
work
judicially
in
trying
to
give
definition
to
this.
in
terms
of
some
kind
of
a
fraud
or
a
deceit
this
court
and
some
of
the
early
cases
said
in
speaking
of
the
term
collusion
it
means
a
fraud
upon
the
court
and
nothing
more.
now
that
imply
something
bad,
something
deceitful,
there
are
cases,
your
honor
where
people
have
come
in
to
court
and
said,
“i'm
here
by
an
assignment”
and
of
this
cause
of
action
and
the
question
has
been
put
where
is
the
assignment
and
you
refused
to
produce
it.
and
the
court
said,
“this
must
have
be
a
sham
because
you
refuse
to
produce
the
assignment,
we
don't
think
there
ever
was
one.”
there
are
many
cases
where
there
are
people
have
deliberately
lied
to
court,
had
brought
in
a
false
set
of
acts.
if
we
could
have
said
for
example,
if
by
assignment
it
might
have
said
that
between
the
citizens
of
different
states
that
the
assignment
was
here
made
to
a
citizen,
the
state
of
oklahoma
when
in
fact
the
assignee
was
not
a
citizen
of
the
state
of
oklahoma,
i
think
that
is
pure
fraud,
pure
collusion
and
many
cases
approach
that
type
of
situation
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
not
in
this
case.
certainly
not,
this
was
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
that
is
what
--
that
is
the
way
chief
judge
biggs
define
it.
and
the
--
that
is
generally
way
i
think
in
any
people
conceive
a
collusion.
and
there
are
cases
where
there
may
be
collusion,
there
is
collusion
between
a
plaintiff
and
defendant,
solely
in
order
to
have
a
federal
court
determined
their
case,
their
controversy.
mr.
eugene
gressman
and
if
that
is
found
out
it's
usually
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
thrown
out
and
if
i
may
borrow
one
of
your
honors'
prior
remarks,
it
may
be
somewhat
difficult
to
define
the
concept
of
collusion
but
i
know
collusion
when
i
see
it
and
i
don't
think
this
is
it
in
this
case.
mr.
eugene
gressman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
and
raises
the
general
question
of
whether
federal
diversity
jurisdiction
can
be
created
by
a
lawful
assignment
of
a
contract
or
a
money
claim
to
a
plaintiff.
more
specifically,
the
question
is
whether
the
assignment
of
a
contract
or
a
money
claim
is
improper
or
collusive
within
the
meaning
of
section
1359
of
the
judicial
code
where
the
assignment
itself
is
legal
under
state
law,
where
one
motive
or
the
assignment
is
to
gain
access
to
the
federal
court
like
creating
diversity
of
citizenship
specified
in
section
1330
(a)
(2).
and
thirdly,
where
part
of
the
consideration
or
the
transaction
was
a
percentage
of
the
recovery
obtained
on
the
assigned
claim.
now
counsel
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
yes,
your
honor.
it's
solely
a
federal
question
as
to
whether
the
court
itself
has
jurisdiction
or
whether
it
has
lost
jurisdiction.
mr.
eugene
gressman
yes,
your
honor.
now
counsel
as
candidly
conceded
and
the
court
below
and
we
repeated
to
this
court
while
it
is
not
a
matter
of
the
record
but
one
of
the
major
motives
in
the
establishment
of
this
transaction
was
a
desire
or
the
to
create
the
basis
for
invoking
the
diversity
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
district
court.
now
that
motivation
however,
has
to
be
viewed
in
light
of
the
realities
of
the
situation
that
was
confronting
the
various
parties
in
this
case.
now
the
brief
where
the
respondent
has
sought
to
paint
a
rather
bleak
and
sinister
picture
of
the
events
in
this
case
that
i
suggest
are
not
justified
by
the
record
and
certainly
not
by
the
facts
as
we
know
them,
there
was
no
senator
or
secret
efforts
made
to
defraud
any
party
or
to
secrete
any
documents
from
the
court
or
from
anyone
else.
what
happened
in
this
case
of
course
as
we
see
it
is
a
classic
illustration
of
a
desire
to
avoid
what
one
of
these
parties
the
panama
and
venezuela
finance
company
viewed
as
prejudice
in
the
state
courts
and
to
avoid
that
prejudice
or
possibility
of
prejudice
is
really
the
constitutional
raise
on
debtor
of
federal
diversity
jurisdiction.
the
major,
indeed
the
sole
justification
that
has
ever
been
suggested
for
diversity
jurisdiction
is
to
permit
state
causes
of
action
to
bid,
tried
and
heard
in
the
federal
courts
where
the
parties
have
any
choice
in
the
matter
for
one
reason
or
another
may
fear
or
some
degree
or
some
element
of
prejudice
may
follow
them
if
they
invoke
the
jurisdiction
of
the
state
court
rather
than
the
federal
court.
mr.
eugene
gressman
that
is
right,
your
honor.
mr.
eugene
gressman
right,
it's
an
alien
corporation.
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
i
think
you
have
first
to
look
back
to
the
original
situation
under
which
this
arose.
the
original
situation
you
will
recall
was
essentially
a
contract
entered
into
in
1959
between
two
alien
corporations
in
effect
whereby
the
caribbean
mills
the
respondent
here
agreed
to
pay
over
a
period
of
years
$165,000.00
to
panama
and
venezuela
finance
company
which
was
also
an
alien
corporation
having
been
incorporated
in
panama.
now,
when
several
years
later
caribbean
mills
defaulted
on
that
contract
and
indeed
repudiated
the
contract,
panama
finance
company
was
faced
with
a
situation
out
of
which
this
whole
transaction
arose
to
with
panama
could
not
have
sued
caribbean
mills
in
the
federal
court
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
both
were
aliens.
now,
the
only
recourse
panama
had
to
a
court
action
was
to
sue
presumably
in
haiti
or
in
the
texas
state
court.
now
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
that
is
right,
your
honor
more
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
that
is
right,
it
is
more
than
that
your
honor
it
actively
doing
business
in
the
state
of
texas
and
they
raise
this
point
and
it
was
decided
against
them
that
they
had
adequate
contacts
with
the
state
to
permit
service
and
a
suit
in
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
court
in
texas.
mr.
eugene
gressman
well
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
yes.
your
honor
this
was
the
practical
situation
facing
them
as
i
say
the
defendant
corporation
the
caribbean
mills
corporation
while
it
was
technically
and
legally
a
citizen
of
haiti,
an
alien
was
also
owned
a
dominated
by
the
murchison
family
in
dallas,
texas.
most
of
the
officers
of
the
company
resided
in
dallas
and
did
--
it
actively
did
corporate
business
there,
clint
murchison
was
one
of
the
witnesses
in
this
case
testified
and
frankly
they
feared
that
this
was
more
than
simply
an
alien
defendant,
this
was
one
of
the
classic
instances
of
where
they
feared
that
a
--
it
would
been
impossible
to
overcome
the
local
kind
of
prejudice
that
does
ensue
in
these
situations
where
you
have
a
dominant
local
interest
involved
on
the
defendant
side.
plus
the
fact
that
they
were
a
finance
companies
in
addition
to
being
an
alien
here
are
notoriously
poorer
risk
as
a
plaintiff
attempting
to
secure
a
money
judgments.
mr.
eugene
gressman
i
think
they
feared
that,
yes.
mr.
eugene
gressman
yes,
it
was
your
honor.
mr.
eugene
gressman
drawn
from
the
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
right.
mr.
eugene
gressman
right.
but
you
have
a
broader
selection
in
the
federal
court
i
suppose
and
you
--
not
17
counties
i
think
are
involved
in
the
federal
court
whereas
the
state
court
would
have
been
the
local
precinct
or
local
city
anyway.
but
in
any
event
they
tried
to
realize
that
in
their
own
hands
this
claim
wasn't
worth
very
much
and
they
were
actively
seeking
to
sell
this
claim
to
a
various
numbers
of
persons
at
a
discount.
i
think
at
one
time
they
tried
to
sell
it
for
$25,000.00
and
nobody
would
take
and
they
eventually
came
to
mr.
banner,
an
attorney
in
texas
and
ask
him
if
he
would
be
interested
in
purchasing
this
and
he
said
no.
looking
into
it
he
then
contacted
another
attorney,
mr.
kramer
the
plaintiff
in
this
case
and
ask
if
he
would
be
interested
in
purchasing
or
arranging
to
take
over
this
claim.
now,
the
respondent
claims
that
somehow
mr.
banner
was
sort
of
a
double
agent
here
acting
as
an
attorney
for
panama
as
well
as
for
mr.
kramer.
far
from
that
he
has
never
acted
at
anytime
as
the
attorney
for
panama
has
never
receive
a
cent
from
it
and
has
treated
them
at
arm's-length
at
all
time
so
that
whatever
concern
or
connection
mr.
banner
had
with
the
case
does
not
reflect
upon
panama's
interest
or
lack
of
interest
in
this
situation.
in
any
event
when
mr.
kramer
became
interested
in
this
and
purely
for
profit
motives
frankly,
the
problem
arose
just
to,
how
they
could
arrange
a
transaction
that
would
be
lawful
and
that
would
permit
adequate
consideration
and
what
have
you
to
be
arranged.
now,
the
testimony
that
mr.
kramer
gave
at
the
trial
to
be
frankly
said
he
didn't
have
a
$165,000.00,
he
didn't
have
a
hundred
thousand
dollars
to
pay
for
this
claim,
nor
did
he
have
the
facilities
to
obtain
a
bank
loan
for
this.
so
after
discussing
this
at
some
length
with
his
then
attorney
mr.
banner
they
came
to
a
conclusion
that
maybe
we
can
have
some
sort
of
the
deferred
type
of
consideration
let's
call
it
a
bonus.
let's
call
it
anything
else
to
be
payable
out
of
whatever
you
may
be
able
to
get
from
a
lawsuit
recovered
as
a
result
of
an
assignment
of
the
claim
to
mr.
kramer
and
that
is
exactly
what
happened.
it
was
then
arranged
to
have
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
pardon?
mr.
eugene
gressman
well
that
was
part
of
it,
yes
but
that
was
not
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
that
was
not
in
mr.
kramer
was
not
receiving
that
as
a
lawyer,
he
--
in
fact,
he
is
a
lawyer
but
he
was
not
acting
as
a
lawyer
in
this
case
mr.
banner
was
his
lawyer
at
all
times
but
they
did
arrange
this
through
first
of
all
an
assignment
in
a
piece
of
paper
which
in
unequivocal
terms
stated
that
panama
finance
company
hereby
assigns,
conveys,
transfers
all
of
its
interests
including
causes
of
action
and
claims
under
this
1959
contract
to
mr.
clayton
s.
kramer
for
$1.00
and
other
adequate
or
valuable
consideration
receipt
whereof
is
hereby
acknowledged.
now,
that
by
concession
and
by
all
applicable
law
universally
recognized
was
a
complete
bona
fide
and
unexceptional
transfer
of
all
of
panama's
interest
in
this
contract.
standing
by
itself
it
was
adequate
under
state
law
to
permit
the
cause
of
action
to
be
brought
by
mr.
kramer
as
the
complete
and
full
assignee
of
this
contract
and
of
this
cause
of
action.
it
was
unnecessary
to
have
anything
else
proved
or
shown
or
executed
in
order
to
create
a
complete
and
lawful
assignment
but
to
arrange
more
of
this
deferred
--
lucky
considered
being
deferred
consideration
if
you
will
that
entered
into
simultaneously
without
any
secret,
without
any
collusion
or
devious
motivations
or
actions
into
the
so-called
collateral
agreement.
it
wasn't
pleaded
in
the
case
because
it
didn't
have
to
be.
all
he
had
to
plead
in
the
complaint
was
that
he
was
an
assignee
under
this
first
and
original
document
of
assignment.
the
assignment
or
the
collateral
agreement
completely
reaffirmed
the
assignment
and
made
claim
what
was
already
implicit
that
panama
had
given
up
complete
control
over
the
lawsuit
or
any
lawsuit
that
kramer
might
bring.
kramer
had
complete
control
and
management
of
that
suit
and
it
also
provided
for
this
provision
for
the
so-called
bonus
or
the
consideration
of
95%
of
the
net
recovery
which
would
then
go
back
out
of
any
recovery
mr.
kramer
might
receive
from
his
lawsuit.
mr.
eugene
gressman
no,
your
honor.
no,
there
is
no
identity
of
lawyers
among
any
of
these
parties.
mr.
eugene
gressman
that
was
mr.
banner
who
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
no,
he
only
has
represented
mr.
kramer.
mr.
eugene
gressman
mr.
harrell
i
believe
who
was
counsel
for
the
caribbean
mills,
yes.
mr.
eugene
gressman
he
did
not
have
caribbean's
lawyer,
he
did
not
have
panama's
lawyer.
he
had
his
own
lawyer.
mr.
eugene
gressman
the
suggestion
has
been
made
by
the
respondent
but
is
completely
aside
from
the
facts
and
not
accurate
to
say
that
because
mr.
banner
who
is
mr.
kramer's
attorney
was
somehow
acting
on
behalf
of
panama
and
all
this
but
that
is
not
true.
panama
had
a
lawyer,
a
firm
new
york
city
all
times.
they
never
got
into
this
litigation
of
course
but
they
had
their
separate
lawyers
and
mr.
banner
dealt
at
arm's-length
with
that
law
firm
in
the
execution
of
these
documents.
now
it
seems
to
me
that
it
becomes
crystal
clear
that
the
critical
fact
therefore
in
this
case
is
that
the
assignment
itself
was
absolute,
complete,
and
bona
fide
and
indeed
there's
no
dispute
about
that
as
i
see
it
that
all
of
panama's
interest
were
thereby
transferred
and
as
a
result
of
the
assignment
instrument,
panama
had
no
claim,
no
right
under
that
contract,
no
cause
of
action,
no
control
over
the
lawsuit
that
ensued
and
concededly
this
was
proper
under
the
applicable
law
of
texas
and
that
the
law
of
any
other
state
in
the
united
states
to
effectuate
a
complete
transfer
of
all
of
panama's
interest.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
read
however,
the
collateral
agreement
provision
of
the
95%
bonus
as
indicated
that
somehow
panama
retained
some
sort
of
a
beneficial
interest
to
our
in
this
cause
of
action
or
in
the
contract
claim.
now,
while
this
was
conceded
by
the
parties
as
a
legitimate
forum
or
deferred
consideration,
it
is
i
suppose
possible
to
read
this
as
some
sort
of
a
beneficial
interest
of
one
sort
of
another
or
perhaps
an
assignment
or
collection
on
behalf
of
panama.
but
the
worst
or
the
least
can
be
said
about
this
transaction
with
respect
to
the
95%
interest
which
was
to
be
returned
to
panama
was
that
this
was
an
assignment
or
collection
which
is
one
of
the
most
common
transactions
lawful
transactions
that
is
performed
almost
everyday
in
the
business
world
which
gives
the
assignee
complete
control,
complete
domination,
complete
title
of
whatever
is
assigned
to
him
for
collection
and
makes
the
assignee
the
real
per
diem
interest
to
bring
the
suit
and
despite
the
fact
that
he
is
suppose
to
return
part
of
that
recovery
or
all
of
the
recovery
even
in
some
cases
back
to
the
assignor,
it
does
not
make
the
assignment
itself
any
less
complete,
any
less
lawful
and
is
certainly
does
not
make
the
transaction
itself
collusive
under
any
recognized
meaning
of
those
phrases.
it
is
well-established
in
the
law
that
an
assignment
that
shows
an
action
constitutes
the
assignee,
the
proper
party
an
interest
to
sue
even
though
the
instrument
of
assignment
recites,
which
this
one
did
not,
that
the
transfer
is
merely
for
purposes
of
suit
and
obligates
the
assignee
to
account
for
the
proceeds
to
another
person
and
indeed
this
court's
decision
in
titus
versus
wallick
in
306
volume
of
the
united
states
reports
at
282,
is
the
leading
authority
on
the
validity
of
this
kind
of
an
arrangement
and
the
court
there
said
that
under
the,
it
happen
to
be
in
new
york
transaction
there
that
the
repeated
decisions
of
new
york
and
it
could
be
said
of
any
other
state,
it
is
long
been
settled
that
an
assignment
which
purports
to
assign
or
transfer
or
shows
of
action
confers
upon
the
transferee
such
title
and
ownership
as
will
enable
him
to
sue
upon
it.
this
is
true
even
though
the
assignment
is
for
the
purpose
of
suit
only
and
the
transferee
is
obligated
to
account
for
the
proceeds
of
the
suit
to
his
assignor.
and
more
importantly,
and
this
was
the
opinion
written
by
justice
stone.
it
is
evident
that
through
to
this
kind
of
a
transaction
no
fraud
was
perpetrated
upon
the
other
party
or
upon
the
new
york
courts
if
the
assignment
of
the
claim
operated
to
this
in
the
assignee,
such
ownership
or
interest
in
the
claim
was
it
would
enable
him
to
maintain
the
suit
upon
it
there.
mr.
eugene
gressman
no
that
--
well
not
truly
a
diversity
case
in
that
sense
but
it
was
a
full
faith
in
credit
they
had
made
a
--
the
assignee
had
obtained
a
judgment
in
new
york,
which
was
subsequently
attack
in
ohio
as
being
fraudulently
obtained.
and
this
court
says,
“not
at
all
that
there
had
been
no
fraud
perpetrated
by
virtue
of
making
an
assignment
for
collection
only
and
that
this
was
a
perfectly
legitimate
and
lawful
transaction.”
now
we
have
to
therefore
apply
the
language
of
259
to
this
arraignment
which
i
have
described.
and
i
think
it's
very
instructive
to
note
that
1359
of
course
was
created
as
a
part
of
the
1948
revision
of
the
judicial
code.
and
prior
to
1948
we
had
on
the
books
from
the
beginning
of
our
statutes
as
a
matter
in
1789.
the
so-called
anti-assignment
statute
which
was
very
simple
in
its
concept
and
that
was
that
if
the
original
parties
doing
the
transaction
did
not
have
adequate
diversity
or
did
it,
were
unable
to
bring
suit
in
the
federal
court.
you
could
not
by
assignment
create
any
different
result
in
other
words
the
assignee
was
absolutely
bound
by
the
jurisdictional
situation
created
by
the
original
parties
and
you
could
not
change
that.
that
became
incrusted
with
a
lot
of
exceptions
and
a
legislative
jargon
which
made
it
and
also
barred
the
good
assignments
and
the
bad
assignments
as
long
as
the
original
parties
couldn't
sue
and
the
assignee
could
never
bring
an
action.
so
they
decided
to
eliminate
that
provision
completely
and
to
adopt
rather
the
concept
developed
under
the
1875
statute
have
bind
any
kind
of
a
transfer
or
device
which
would
collusively
or
improperly
make
as
a
party
plaintiff
any
individual
where
the
intent
was
to
create
or
invoke
federal
court
jurisdiction.
and
the
revisers
of
the
judicial
code
made
it
very
plain
that
they
were
cutting
down
on
the
assignment
scope
of
the
--
what
you
might
call
the
anti-assignment
statute
by
confining
its
application
to
cases
wherein
the
assignment
is
improperly
or
collusively
made
to
invoke
jurisdiction.
and
they
made
it
clear
that
there
was
no
dispute
about
this
that
the
revisers
meant
to
apply
the
long
established
principles
of
the
1875
statute
to
assignments
and
what
are
those
principles.
well,
the
first
place
it's
clear
that
not
all
assignments
and
not
all
transfers
designed
to
evoke
diversity
jurisdiction
are
outlawed
nor
do
they
divest
the
federal
court
of
jurisdiction.
only
those
that
result
from
a
collusive
or
improper
action
in
establishing
the
party
plaintiff,
many
people
including
many
commentators
seemed
to
think
that
in
1359
bars
all
assignments
that
create
diversity
jurisdiction.
that
simply
is
not
the
way
the
statute
agrees.
mr.
eugene
gressman
that's
one
way
it
could
has
an
absolute
assignment
of
5%
to
mr.
kramer.
mr.
eugene
gressman
no,
i
don't
know
if
there's
any
that
you'd
define
impropriety
or
collusiveness
in
terms
of
the
percent
of
what
is
absolutely
conveyed
or
what
is
beneficially
conveyed.
if
it's
conceded
once
that
you
can
sign
simply
for
collection
only
which
is
done
all
the
time
and
makes
it
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
eugene
gressman
because
it's
for
collection
only
as
i
understand
that
that
has
consistently
been
held
to
make
the
assignee
for
the
collection
only
as
distinguished
from
an
agent
for
collection
only.
mr.
eugene
gressman
well
i
think
that
the
leading
case
that
that
cited
continuously
is
the
titus
v.
wallick
which
is
not
a
1359
case.
mr.
eugene
gressman
i
don't
think
there
is
any
leading
authority
that
that
mentions
this
in
terms
of
1359
although
there
are
some,
your
honor
that
do
--
the
lower
courts
to
having
made
that
point
that
this
makes
the
assignee
for
collection
only
a
proper
party
and
interest
also
says
it
is
not
collusive
under
1359
there
are
some
now
those
are
not
cited.
i
would
be
glad
to
submit
those
too,
your
honor.
there
all
lower
court
opinions
and
i'm
simply
saying
there
is
no
leading
authority
and
certainly
this
court
in
fact
has
never
had
occasion
to
deal
with
the
problem
of
assignments
under
1359
since
it
was
revised
in
1948.
but
i
would
be
glad
to
submit
that
just
a
list
of
the
cases
to,
your
honor
where
that
has
been
held
by
lower
courts.
now,
the
basic
doctrine
that
was
established
and
created
by
these
pre-revision
cases
and
other
types
of
transfers
then
assignments
was
that
a
transfer
was
not
improper
or
collusive
if
it
was
real
rather
than
a
colorable
one.
and
in
fact
operated
to
transfer
all
the
transferors
interest
and
we
submit
that
by
concession
and
that
by
law
and
by
fact
that
requirement
has
here
been
satisfied
by
the
absolute
character
of
the
assignment
to
mr.
kramer
regardless
of
whether
you
conceal
--
conceive
of
that
assignment
as
one
for
collection
of
all
or
some
or
an
absolute
assignment
period.
if
the
transfer
was
lawful
and
complete
as
it
was
here
then
we
submit
that
the
cases
in
this
court
make
it
absolutely
clear
that
the
fact
that
the
transaction
was
motivated
and
designed
by
a
desire
to
create
or
to
utilize
federal
diversity
jurisdiction
becomes
completely
irrelevant.
this
court
has
said
time
and
again
and
this
pre-revision
cases
that
motive
per
se
cannot
invalidate
or
make
collusive
or
improper
a
transaction
that
is
lawful
and
bona
fide
and
result
in
a
complete
transfer
of
legal
title
to
whatever
is
being
transferred.
mr.
eugene
gressman
that
idea
has
been
expressed
by
chief
judge
biggs
in
the
corabi
decision
in
the
third
circuit
which
is
cited
in
our
brief.
and
it's
been
criticized
by
others
that
it
may
not
necessarily
have
to
be
between
the
plaintiff
and
defendant.
it
may
be
many
people
claim
and
this
is
what
the
court
here
and
this
circuit
here
held
it
was
a
collusion,
i
assume,
between
the
assignor
and
the
assignee
in
order
to
permit
the
assignees
to
bring
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
well
that
is
it,
your
honor
it
seems
to
me
that
you
have
to
give
some
content
and
meaningful
content
to
the
words
collusion
or
impropriety.
congress
didn't
use
these
words
inadvisably
they
didn't
mean
to
say
every
time
there
is
a
motive
to
create
jurisdiction
you
have
a
collusive
arrangement.
those
are
not
equivalents
and
it
seems
to
me
that
chief
judge
biggs
in
the
seeking
to
define
and
he
has
done
the
major
work
judicially
in
trying
to
give
definition
to
this.
in
terms
of
some
kind
of
a
fraud
or
a
deceit
this
court
and
some
of
the
early
cases
said
in
speaking
of
the
term
collusion
it
means
a
fraud
upon
the
court
and
nothing
more.
now
that
imply
something
bad,
something
deceitful,
there
are
cases,
your
honor
where
people
have
come
in
to
court
and
said,
“i'm
here
by
an
assignment”
and
of
this
cause
of
action
and
the
question
has
been
put
where
is
the
assignment
and
you
refused
to
produce
it.
and
the
court
said,
“this
must
have
be
a
sham
because
you
refuse
to
produce
the
assignment,
we
don't
think
there
ever
was
one.”
there
are
many
cases
where
there
are
people
have
deliberately
lied
to
court,
had
brought
in
a
false
set
of
acts.
if
we
could
have
said
for
example,
if
by
assignment
it
might
have
said
that
between
the
citizens
of
different
states
that
the
assignment
was
here
made
to
a
citizen,
the
state
of
oklahoma
when
in
fact
the
assignee
was
not
a
citizen
of
the
state
of
oklahoma,
i
think
that
is
pure
fraud,
pure
collusion
and
many
cases
approach
that
type
of
situation
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
not
in
this
case.
certainly
not,
this
was
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
that
is
what
--
that
is
the
way
chief
judge
biggs
define
it.
and
the
--
that
is
generally
way
i
think
in
any
people
conceive
a
collusion.
and
there
are
cases
where
there
may
be
collusion,
there
is
collusion
between
a
plaintiff
and
defendant,
solely
in
order
to
have
a
federal
court
determined
their
case,
their
controversy.
mr.
eugene
gressman
and
if
that
is
found
out
it's
usually
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
thrown
out
and
if
i
may
borrow
one
of
your
honors'
prior
remarks,
it
may
be
somewhat
difficult
to
define
the
concept
of
collusion
but
i
know
collusion
when
i
see
it
and
i
don't
think
this
is
it
in
this
case.
