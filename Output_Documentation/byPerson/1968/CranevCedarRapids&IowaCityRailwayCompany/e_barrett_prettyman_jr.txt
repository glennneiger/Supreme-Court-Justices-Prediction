mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
only
a
single
question
but
one
of
great
importance
in
the
administration
of
the
federal
safety
appliance
act.
the
question
is
whether
in
a
suit
under
that
act
brought
by
a
non-railroad
employee,
the
railroad
can
assert
the
defense
of
contributory
negligence,
and
everyone
concedes
that
the
petitioner
in
this
case
is
covered
by
the
act.
everyone
concedes
that
if
this
same
suit
were
brought
by
a
railroad
employee,
contributory
negligence
could
not
be
asserted
as
a
defense,
even
though
all
the
facts
were
precisely
the
same
and
the
violation
of
the
act
was
precisely
the
same
as
in
the
case
of
the
non-railroad
employee.
here,
petitioner
ronald
crane
was
employed
as
a
meal
house
helper
by
cargill,
incorporated.
his
job
was
to
spot,
weigh
and
help
load
railroad
cars
which
were
delivered
empty
by
the
respondent
railroad
to
cargill,
and
after
loading
were
picked
up
again
by
the
respondent
railroad
for
delivering
in
interstate
commerce.
the
trial
court
properly
instructed
the
jury
and
this
court
can
assume
that
for
the
purpose
of
this
case,
the
railway
cars
on
which
plaintiff
was
working
were
being
used
by
the
defendant
as
part
of
its
system?
now
on
the
night
of
the
accident,
1963,
petitioner
crane
and
his
co-worker
harris,
were
handling
a
string
of
six
railroad
cars.
harris
detached
or
uncoupled
the
two
most
northerly
cars
in
the
string
and
moved
them
along
the
tracks
for
weighing
by
means
of
an
electric
winch
and
cable.
when
these
cars
were
returned
to
the
string,
impact
was
made
with
the
remaining
four
cars
with
sufficient
force
to
move
those
cars
some
five
feet,
even
though
the
brake
was
on
them.
now
at
that
point,
the
two
cars
clearly
should've
re-coupled
automatically
to
the
string
of
four
cars.
as
this
court
undoubtedly
knows
from
prior
cases,
the
federal
safety
appliance
act
as
interpreted
by
this
court
provides
that
railroad
cars
must
be
equipped
with
couplers
which
couple
automatically
by
impact
and
when
set
in
the
proper
position
of
course.
and
which
will
thereafter
remain
coupled
until
set
free
by
some
purposeful
act
of
control.
now
in
this
case,
the
knuckles
were
in
proper
position,
and
the
cars
collided
with
sufficient
impact.
both
crane
and
harris
who
looked
at
the
mechanism
thought
and
testified
that
the
knuckles
were
closed
and
that
the
couplers
appeared
to
be
locked,
but
in
fact
they
were
not
locked.
hours
later,
harris
began
to
move
the
entire
string
of
cars
forward
by
attaching
the
winch
to
the
second
car
with
crane
on
the
third
car
ready
to
put
the
brakes
on,
and
the
first
two
cars
began
to
move
out
on
their
own,
runaway
cars
uncoupled
to
the
rest
of
the
string.
crane
thought
that
these
runaway
cars
were
going
to
ram
into
an
empty
car
which
he
thought
he'd
seen
down
the
tracks
and
which
he
thought
men
were
working,
and
consequently
he
quickly
put
the
brake
on
the
third
car,
he
jumped
down,
he
ran
along
the
tracks,
he
climbed
up
a
ladder
on
the
back
of
the
second
car,
began
to
turn
the
brake
to
stop
these
two
runaway
cars
and
he
fell
to
the
tracks
to
a
cement
pavement.
the
bones
in
his
feet
were
jammed
up
into
his
legs
and
he
was
permanently
injured.
now
before
proceeding
further,
i
want
to
say
just
a
word
about
the
statement
of
facts
given
by
respondent.
we've
answered
each
of
these
statements
with
citations
to
the
record
in
our
reply
brief,
but
the
most
direct
answer
to
them
is
that
precisely
the
same
argument
on
the
facts
was
made
twice
below
to
the
trial
court
in
an
effort
to
keep
this
case
from
going
to
the
jury.
once
at
the
conclusion
of
our
evidence,
once
at
the
conclusion
of
all
the
evidence,
twice
the
trial
judge
rejected
that
version
of
the
facts,
twice
the
trial
said
this
case
can
go
to
the
jury.
and
consequently
we
submit
that
the
respondent
railroad
is
not
free
again
here
to
reargue
these
facts
which
properly
for
the
--
or
for
the
jury
and
which
went
to
the
jury.
crane
brought
his
case
in
an
iowa
state
court
alleging
violation
of
the
federal
safety
appliance
act
and
that
the
railroad
had
provided
cars
with
defective
couplers.
from
the
outset
of
this
case,
crane
argued
that
contributory
negligence
was
not
a
defense,
was
not
a
defense
where
there
was
a
violation
of
the
federal
safety
appliance
act.
that
liability
was
absolute
once
a
violation
was
shown
to
be
approximate
cause
of
his
injury.
the
railroad
argued
otherwise.
and
the
trial
judge
adopted
the
railroads
argument
and
allowed
the
defense
of
contributory
negligence
to
go
to
the
jury
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
put
the
burden
on
crane
to
prove
absence
of
contributory
negligence
rather
than
on
the
railroad
to
prove
the
presence
of
contributory
negligence.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
no
sir,
as
a
matter
of
fact
that's
the
minority
rule,
most
states
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
oh,
i'm
sorry
i
misunderstood
you.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
it
is
a
rule
under
iowa
law,
yes
sir.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
now
the
jury
decided
for
the
railroad
and
denied
all
recovery
to
crane,
the
iowa
supreme
court
affirmed
with
two
justices
dissenting,
although
it
recognized
that
recent
opinions
of
this
court
put
the
matter
in
some
doubt.
it
did
not
feel
free
to
depart
from
what
it
considered
older
case
law
indicating
that
all
common
law
defenses
except
assumption
of
risk
are
applicable
to
non-railroad
employees.
that
now
is
the
issue
before
the
court.
now
the
problem
arises
because
the
federal
safety
appliance
act
was
passed
in
1893
without
any
specific
reference
to
a
remedy
other
than
a
suit
for
penalties
by
the
united
states.
and
consequently,
suits
for
violation
of
this
act
were
brought
in
state
courts,
and
the
earliest
case
on
contributory
negligence
from
this
court,
the
schlemmer
case,
held
that
in
the
absence
of
legislation
at
the
time
of
the
injury
in
that
case
taking
away
the
defense,
the
common
law
controlled.
we
show
in
our
brief
how
we
think
schlemmer
was
misinterpreted
in
later
decisions,
but
in
any
event
it
certainly
true
that
between
1911
and
1935,
this
court
did
state
in
dicta
in
several
opinions
that
state
law
controlled
as
to
the
defense
of
contributory
negligence.
that
certainly
is
true.
in
the
meantime
however
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
no
sir
we
didn't.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes,
diminution
of
damages
under
comparative
negligence
would
come
into
play
only
in
a
case
under
fela
only
and
not
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--
involving
the
violation
of
the
federal
safety
appliance
act.
but
you'll
recall
that
in
fela,
as
soon
as
there
is
a
violation
of
the
federal
safety
act,
congress
made
it
very
clear
that
contributory
negligence
went
out
the
window
altogether.
right.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
now
fela
of
course
was
passed
in
1908,
and
by
itself
it
covered
only
railroad
employees.
this
act
did
set
out
a
specific
cause
of
action,
a
federal
cause
of
action.
it
provided
that
in
a
suit
under
fela
alone,
as
we've
pointed
out,
the
contributory
negligence
of
the
employee
would
diminish
damages
if
it
was
only
under
fela
and
would
do
away
with
contributory
negligence
if
a
violation
of
the
federal
safety
act
would
apply.
and
in
those
early
cases
under
both
fela
and
the
safety
act,
liability
in
those
days
was
thought
off
in
traditional
negligence
terms.
the
charges
to
the
juries
in
those
days
and
even
in
the
language
in
this
court's
opinions
in
those
early
days
talked
in
terms
of
negligence,
in
terms
of
due
care,
and
so
i
think
it's
hardly
surprising
that
this
court
in
these
early
cases
accept
that
the
general
doctrine
that
a
contributory
negligence
would
be
applicable.
but
beginning
in
the
late
1930's
a
change
began
to
take
place
in
the
reading
of
the
safety
act.
commentators
have
pointed
out
that
the
change
was
comparable
to
the
development
or
the
evolution
of
the
law
in
regard
to
interstate
commerce.
the
court
in
the
late
1930's,
sensing
that
the
restrictions
which
the
state
courts
were
placing
on
recovery
in
these
cases
was
not
the
will
of
congress,
began
requiring
stricter
standards
of
liability
by
the
railroads
for
violating
the
safety
act.
the
court
finally
said
that
liability
under
the
act
had
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
negligence,
negligence
was
completely
out
of
the
matter,
and
that
the
railroad
owed
an
absolute
duty
to
those
properly
upon
its
lines
to
maintain
its
equipment
in
efficient
condition.
and
then
in
due
course,
the
court
came
to
the
terms
absolute
liability,
and
absolute
prohibition
in
interpreting
the
safety
act.
now
the
use
of
these
terms
could
hardly
have
been
inadvertent
or
imprecise
as
suggested
by
the
iowa
supreme
court.
the
shields
case
for
example,
involved
the
employee
of
an
independent
contractor
and
therefore
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
fela,
it
was
not
brought
under
fela
at
all.
contributory
negligence
was
specifically
pleaded
as
a
defense
in
that
case.
the
trial
court
instructed
the
contributory
negligence
was
not
a
defense.
the
railroad
made
this
a
point
on
appeal
to
the
fifth
circuit.
the
fifth
circuit
specifically
said
that
the
plaintiff
was
invoking
absolute
liability.
this
court
in
its
opinion
mentioned
that
plaintiff
was
invoking
absolute
liability,
and
then
it
went
on
to
say
that
violation
of
the
act
did
result
in
absolute
liability.
now
in
the
light
of
the
record
in
the
case
like
that
to
say
that
this
court
had
merely
used
the
term
absolute
viability
loosely
or
inadvertently
of
course
we
say
simply
makes
no
sense.
what
we're
asking
here
is
that
this
safety
act
be
interpreted
in
the
light
of
the
overall
intent
of
congress,
which
was
to
impose
on
the
railroads
whatever
liability
was
necessary
to
make
them
maintain
their
equipment
in
proper
condition.
and
yet
look
what
happens
now
if
the
court
adapts
the
reasoning
of
the
respondent
in
this
case?
the
railroad
is
able
to
turn
over
a
car,
a
defective
car,
to
an
independent
third
party
such
as
cargill.
the
railroad
knows
that
it's
not
going
to
receive
that
car
back
on
its
tracks
for
a
period
of
time.
now
if
contributory
negligence
can
be
asserted
by
an
employee
of
that
third
party,
it's
very
much
to
the
advantage
of
the
railroad
to
leave
that
car
defective,
leave
it
defective,
wait
till
it
gets
back
on
its
lines
because
if
the
injury
occurs
in
the
interim,
they're
going
to
have
a
lot
easier
time
of
it.
how
could
that
possibly
have
been
the
intent
of
congress?
congress'
intent
must
have
been
to
require
the
railroad
to
fix
this
equipment
at
the
earliest
possible
time
and
to
impose
whatever
liability
that
required
them
to
do
it.
and
look
what
other
results
followed
here.
in
this
case,
the
trial
court
not
only
placed
the
burden
upon
mr.
crane
to
prove
by
a
preponderance
or
a
greater
weight
of
the
evidence
that
he
was
not
guilty
of
contributory
negligence,
but
listen
to
this.
it
instructed
that
if
his
contributory
negligence
contributed
in
any
way
or
in
any
degree
directly
to
the
injury,
he
could
not
recover
at
all.
now,
what
happens?
mr.
crane
thus
winds
up
with
less
chance
of
recovery
even
though
the
railroad
violated
the
safety
act
then
if
one
of
the
railroad's
own
employees
had
been
injured
and
the
railroad
had
been
guilty
only
of
simple
negligence,
not
even
of
a
violation
of
the
safety
act
because
in
that
case,
the
employee
could
recover
diminished
damages
but
at
least
damages
of
some
kind
whereas
in
--
in
this
case,
the
employee
of
the
third
party
can't
recover
at
all.
and
we
just
submit
that
that
could
not
possibly
have
been
the
intent
of
congress.
that
the
intent
was
entirely
the
other
way,
because
if
it's
one
thing
these
two
act
show
if
they're
read
together
it's
that
congress
was
concerned
primarily
about
violations
of
the
safety
act.
that's
what
it
was
concerned
about
if
you
compare
the
statutes
every
time
the
safety
act
is
mentioned.
liability
grows
greater,
the
standards
become
stricter.
that's
what
they
were
concerned
about,
the
thousands
of
deaths
and
injuries
that
were
occurring
because
equipment
was
improper.
now
the
type
of
interpretation
that
we
seek
here
is
certainly
nothing
new
to
the
statute.
time
and
again
this
court
has
read
the
literal
language
of
the
act
in
the
light
of
the
overall
writing
intent
of
congress.
in
once
case
for
example,
although
the
act
only
refers
to
couplers
coupling
automatically
by
impact
and
uncoupling
without
the
necessity
of
going
between
cars,
this
court
required
in
addition
that
the
couplers
remained
coupled
until
set
free
by
some
purposeful
act
of
control.
that
wasn't
in
the
statute,
but
this
court
added
it
because
it
thought
that
that
was
the
plain
meaning
of
congress
in
passing
the
statute.
in
another
case,
the
court
struck
the
fellow
servant
defense
from
safety
act
cases,
even
though
the
act
itself
made
no
reference
whatever
to
the
fellow
servant
rule,
and
the
court
said
the
obvious
purpose
of
the
legislature
was
to
supplant
the
qualified
duty
of
the
common
law
with
an
absolute
duty
deemed
by
it
nor
just.
in
still
another
case,
it
was
argued
that
the
safety
act
made
clear
by
its
various
provisions
that
it
applied
only
to
railroad
workers.
and
this
court
held
it
applicable
to
motorist
on
the
highway
as
well
who
came
across
the
tracks
and
any
one
else
as
a
matter
fact
who
were
properly
on
the
railroads
properly.
and
still
again
the
court
ruled
that
assumption
of
risk
was
just
as
applicable
to
employees
of
a
connecting
carrier
as
it
was
to
the
defendant
railroad,
even
though
the
assumption
of
risk
provision
would
seem
to
have
been
applicable
only
to
employees
of
the
guilty
carrier.
and
in
that
case,
it's
interesting
that
the
court
relied
on
both
fela
and
the
safety
act
even
though
the
case
was
brought
only
under
the
safety
act.
now
this
brings
me
to
the
point
that
has
been
emphasized
by
the
court
so
strongly
many
times,
and
that
is
that
the
safety
act
and
fela
are
really
correlative,
interdependent,
interrelated
statutes,
each
gain
sustenance
from
the
other,
each
must
be
read
in
the
light
of
the
other
and
we
say
that
the
specific
abolition
of
the
defense
of
contributory
negligence
in
fela
permeates
the
entire
safety
act.
in
other
words,
so
long
as
the
injured
party
is
one
who
is
covered
by
the
safety
act,
which
is
clearly
the
case,
concededly
the
case
here,
the
railroad
should
not
be
able
to
use
contributory
negligence
to
defeat
him
any
more
that
it
can
now
use
assumption
of
risk
to
defeat
him
or
the
fellow
servant
doctrine
to
defeat
him.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
correct.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
correct.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
let
me
put
it
this
way
mr.
justice,
i'm
not
urging
the
construction
you've
mentioned
at
first
simply
because
i
don't
think
it's
necessary.
i
think
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well
you
say
to
treat
him
as
if
he
was
in
fact
a
railroad
employee.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
the
reason
it
wasn't
is
that
fela
on
its
face
applies
only
to
railroad
workers.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes,
although
i
might
put
it
a
little
differently,
i
would
say
that
i'm
asking
you
to
realize
that
congress
could
not
possibly
have
met
to
discriminate
against
non-railway
employees
leaving
these
two
statutes
together.
it
could
not
possibly
have
met
to
allow
a
railroad
employee
to
recover,
and
a
non-railroad
employee
properly
upon
the
property,
properly
working
on
these
cars
not
to
recover
under
precisely
the
same
circumstances.
i
think
congress's
intent,
if
you
read
these
two
statutes
together
as
the
court
have
said
you
must
do,
is
clearly
to
impose
as
the
court
itself
have
said
absolute
liability
in
either
instance.
in
the
(inaudible)
case,
it
was
not
under
fela
either
your
honor,
and
yet
the
court
said
there
was
absolute
liability.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i
agree
that
it's
not
inconceivable,
but
if
your
honor
will
look
at
the
legislative
history
you'll
find
that
congress
clearly
recognized
right
from
the
beginning
that
others
--
other
than
railroad
employees
were
going
to
be
clearly
affected.
it
provided
in
the
preamble
to
the
act,
for
example,
that
this
act
was
an
act
to
promote
the
safety
of
employees
and
travelers
by
--
upon
railroads
by
compelling.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
that's
correct
sir,
and
i'm
saying
that
the
safety
act
provision
in
fela,
that
is
the
provision
that
once
the
safety
act
is
violated
in
fela,
you
have
a
higher
standard
clearly
implies
that
the
--
that
once
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well
the
fela
of
course
was
passed
later,
passed
in
1908,
and
the
--
and
that
statute
provides
as
you
know
simply
that
once
the
safety
appliance
act
is
violated
that
contributory
negligence
goes
out.
this
court
has
gone
on
in
later
cases
to
make
clear
the
class
of
people
who
are
covered
by
the
safety
appliance
act
greatly
broadening
it,
and
that
we
simply
say
that
this
court
has
recognized
that
you're
not
going
to
discriminate
when
you
read
these
two
cases
--
these
two
acts
together
unless
you
find
specific
congressional
intent
to
rule
out
this
kind
of
interpretation.
and
we
certainly
find
no
legislative
history
of
any
kind
indicating
any
attempt
to
discriminate
against
or
make
the
burden
greater
for
the
non-railroad
employee.
i
grant
your
honor
that
perhaps
would
not
be
beyond
the
power
of
congress
to
do
so,
but
the
point
of
it
is
that
we
can't
find
any
indication
that
they
did
intend
to
do
so.
now
we
pointed
in
our
brief
to
all
kinds
of
defenses
that
the
states
could
use
and
they're
presently
using
in
their
state
cases
in
ordinary
negligence
actions
to
defeat
claims
by
plaintiffs.
and
if
all
these
are
applicable
in
the
respective
states
under
this
federal
statute,
we
say
it's
going
to
encourage
exactly
what
congress
was
attempting
to
frustrate
namely
a
spotty
and
differing
recovery
in
each
state
under
this
federal
statue
depending
upon
whether
the
local
rule
happens
to
be
stringent
or
liberal
in
the
particular
case.
so
in
summary
we
say
that
absent,
the
specific
intent
to
discriminate
that
the
courts
use
of
the
term
absolute
liability
in
recent
years
in
these
cases
was
purposeful
that
so
long
is
there
is
a
defect
as
there
clearly
was
here.
so
long
as
there
is
a
cause
or
relationship
between
the
defect
and
the
injury
that
liability
automatically
follows.
we
submit
that
we're
long
past
the
day
when
an
employee
merely
because
of
some
negligent
act
no
matter
how
slight,
thereby
excludes
himself
from
all
recovery
under
remedial
legislation
of
this
kind.
i'll
save
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal
if
i
may
sir.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
mr.
justice
white,
you
put
finger
exactly
on
the
point
here.
of
course
there
is
a
cause
of
action.
this
court
has
said
so
in
unmistakable
language,
it
said,
"a
failure
of
equipment
to
perform
as
required
by
the
federal
safety
appliance
act
is
in
itself
an
actionable
wrong."
that's
what
you
said
in
o'donnell.
is
in
itself
an
actionable
wrong
in
no
way
depended
upon
negligence.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
that
is
the
point.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
what
mr.
dallas
is
really
arguing
about
is
whether
there
is
a
federal
cause
of
action
and
i
think
myself
that
that
is
questionable.
i
don't
think
that's
been
finally
decided.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
there
is
clearly
a
cause
of
action
under
federal
law
which
can
be
brought
in
the
state
courts
and
even
schlemmer
said
that
it
is
a
federal
question
whether
a
particular
defense
could
be
asserted
when
--
under
the
federal
safety
appliance
act.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
exactly.
so
what
do
you
have?
you
have
this
court
saying
that
under
these
federal
statutes
brought
in
state
court,
we
must
look
to
federal
standards
to
see
defenses
and
other
matters
which
go
directly
to
the
question
of
liability.
alright,
now
what
is
this
court
going
to
say
the
federal
standard
is?
is
it
going
to
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i'm
sorry
sir?
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
it
has,
that's
my
feeling.
it
said
he
talks
about
a
rule
of
law
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
no
sir,
no
sir.
he's
--
he
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
unless
with
a
possible
exception
of
schlemmer.
i
think
that
schlemmer
doesn't
stand
for
the
outright
proposition
that
contributory
negligence
is
a
defense,
but
if
you
disagree
with
me
then
yes
you
have
to
overrule
schlemmer.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i
don't
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
in
schlemmer,
if
you
interpret
it
that
way,
it
did.
in
the
other
cases
following
schlemmer
it
was
entirely
dicta
because
the
jury
verdicts
were
always
with
plaintiff.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
no
and
i
think
the
reason
is
and
this
is
the
point
i
wanted
to
make
was
that
i
think
this
doctrine
is
dead
anyway.
it
isn't
a
doctrine
of
60
years
that
hasn't
been
overruled,
if
you
go
to
these
cases
like
shields
and
affolder
and
carter
and
o'donnell
and
brady
and
meyers,
what
is
it
mean
if
they're
not
talking
in
terms
of
absolute
liability
and
absolute
prohibition.
they're
not
just
talking
about
absolute
duty
as
mr.
dallas
would
have
you
believe,
they
talk
about
absolute
liability
and
absolute
liability
means
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i
can
give
you
a
case
your
honor
where
assumption
of
risk
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes
but
only
--
it
would
seem
as
to
railroad
employees.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes,
my
--
it's
my
position
that
it
was
in
shields.
it
was
pleaded
in
shields,
it
was
clearly
presented,
i
contend
in
the
instructions
to
shields
at
least
they
objected
to
the
instruction
that
the
contributory
negligence
was
deemed
not
to
be
a
defense
in
that
case,
and
shields
was
solely
under
the
safety
appliance
act,
not
under
fela.
not
it's
my
position
that
fela
chose
the
way
only
in
terms
to
the
legislative
intent
to
make
this
act
one
of
absolute
liability
and
that
in
no
other
way
can
you
possibly
carry
out
the
intent
of
congress.
if
you're
going
to
say
that
is
the
federal
standard
that
contributory
negligence
applies,
if
the
state
says
so,
you
end
up
with
a
case
like
this
one
where
a
jury
is
allowed
to
conclude
that
if
there
was
contributory
negligence
in
any
way
or
in
any
degree,
this
man
gets
nothing.
i
say
that
could
not
conceivably
have
been
the
intent
of
congress.
and
your
honor,
the
only
thing
i
would
note
in
addition
to
that
is
that
there
was
a
mention
of
this
emergency
instruction
in
an
attempt
to
show
that
really
what
went
to
jury
was
fair.
i
need
only
say
that
we
clearly
told
the
court
that
that
instruction
was
given
solely
because
with
our
contributory
negligence
argument
had
been
rejected.
if
you're
going
to
talk
about
unfairness,
let's
look
at
this
man
who
had
been
employed
for
six
months,
who
admittedly
was
not
a
railroad
worker,
who
did
not
know
anything
about
couplers
and
yet
he
is
deemed
to
be
contributory
negligent
because
he
didn't
see
the
pin
drop,
or
he
didn't
stretch
the
cars.
that
is
where
the
unfairness
comes
in
these
cases,
and
that
clearly
is
not
what
congress
intended
when
it
said
that
the
railroads
had
to
keep
this
equipment
in
effective
conditions.
thank
you.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
only
a
single
question
but
one
of
great
importance
in
the
administration
of
the
federal
safety
appliance
act.
the
question
is
whether
in
a
suit
under
that
act
brought
by
a
non-railroad
employee,
the
railroad
can
assert
the
defense
of
contributory
negligence,
and
everyone
concedes
that
the
petitioner
in
this
case
is
covered
by
the
act.
everyone
concedes
that
if
this
same
suit
were
brought
by
a
railroad
employee,
contributory
negligence
could
not
be
asserted
as
a
defense,
even
though
all
the
facts
were
precisely
the
same
and
the
violation
of
the
act
was
precisely
the
same
as
in
the
case
of
the
non-railroad
employee.
here,
petitioner
ronald
crane
was
employed
as
a
meal
house
helper
by
cargill,
incorporated.
his
job
was
to
spot,
weigh
and
help
load
railroad
cars
which
were
delivered
empty
by
the
respondent
railroad
to
cargill,
and
after
loading
were
picked
up
again
by
the
respondent
railroad
for
delivering
in
interstate
commerce.
the
trial
court
properly
instructed
the
jury
and
this
court
can
assume
that
for
the
purpose
of
this
case,
the
railway
cars
on
which
plaintiff
was
working
were
being
used
by
the
defendant
as
part
of
its
system?
now
on
the
night
of
the
accident,
1963,
petitioner
crane
and
his
co-worker
harris,
were
handling
a
string
of
six
railroad
cars.
harris
detached
or
uncoupled
the
two
most
northerly
cars
in
the
string
and
moved
them
along
the
tracks
for
weighing
by
means
of
an
electric
winch
and
cable.
when
these
cars
were
returned
to
the
string,
impact
was
made
with
the
remaining
four
cars
with
sufficient
force
to
move
those
cars
some
five
feet,
even
though
the
brake
was
on
them.
now
at
that
point,
the
two
cars
clearly
should've
re-coupled
automatically
to
the
string
of
four
cars.
as
this
court
undoubtedly
knows
from
prior
cases,
the
federal
safety
appliance
act
as
interpreted
by
this
court
provides
that
railroad
cars
must
be
equipped
with
couplers
which
couple
automatically
by
impact
and
when
set
in
the
proper
position
of
course.
and
which
will
thereafter
remain
coupled
until
set
free
by
some
purposeful
act
of
control.
now
in
this
case,
the
knuckles
were
in
proper
position,
and
the
cars
collided
with
sufficient
impact.
both
crane
and
harris
who
looked
at
the
mechanism
thought
and
testified
that
the
knuckles
were
closed
and
that
the
couplers
appeared
to
be
locked,
but
in
fact
they
were
not
locked.
hours
later,
harris
began
to
move
the
entire
string
of
cars
forward
by
attaching
the
winch
to
the
second
car
with
crane
on
the
third
car
ready
to
put
the
brakes
on,
and
the
first
two
cars
began
to
move
out
on
their
own,
runaway
cars
uncoupled
to
the
rest
of
the
string.
crane
thought
that
these
runaway
cars
were
going
to
ram
into
an
empty
car
which
he
thought
he'd
seen
down
the
tracks
and
which
he
thought
men
were
working,
and
consequently
he
quickly
put
the
brake
on
the
third
car,
he
jumped
down,
he
ran
along
the
tracks,
he
climbed
up
a
ladder
on
the
back
of
the
second
car,
began
to
turn
the
brake
to
stop
these
two
runaway
cars
and
he
fell
to
the
tracks
to
a
cement
pavement.
the
bones
in
his
feet
were
jammed
up
into
his
legs
and
he
was
permanently
injured.
now
before
proceeding
further,
i
want
to
say
just
a
word
about
the
statement
of
facts
given
by
respondent.
we've
answered
each
of
these
statements
with
citations
to
the
record
in
our
reply
brief,
but
the
most
direct
answer
to
them
is
that
precisely
the
same
argument
on
the
facts
was
made
twice
below
to
the
trial
court
in
an
effort
to
keep
this
case
from
going
to
the
jury.
once
at
the
conclusion
of
our
evidence,
once
at
the
conclusion
of
all
the
evidence,
twice
the
trial
judge
rejected
that
version
of
the
facts,
twice
the
trial
said
this
case
can
go
to
the
jury.
and
consequently
we
submit
that
the
respondent
railroad
is
not
free
again
here
to
reargue
these
facts
which
properly
for
the
--
or
for
the
jury
and
which
went
to
the
jury.
crane
brought
his
case
in
an
iowa
state
court
alleging
violation
of
the
federal
safety
appliance
act
and
that
the
railroad
had
provided
cars
with
defective
couplers.
from
the
outset
of
this
case,
crane
argued
that
contributory
negligence
was
not
a
defense,
was
not
a
defense
where
there
was
a
violation
of
the
federal
safety
appliance
act.
that
liability
was
absolute
once
a
violation
was
shown
to
be
approximate
cause
of
his
injury.
the
railroad
argued
otherwise.
and
the
trial
judge
adopted
the
railroads
argument
and
allowed
the
defense
of
contributory
negligence
to
go
to
the
jury
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
put
the
burden
on
crane
to
prove
absence
of
contributory
negligence
rather
than
on
the
railroad
to
prove
the
presence
of
contributory
negligence.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
no
sir,
as
a
matter
of
fact
that's
the
minority
rule,
most
states
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
oh,
i'm
sorry
i
misunderstood
you.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
it
is
a
rule
under
iowa
law,
yes
sir.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
now
the
jury
decided
for
the
railroad
and
denied
all
recovery
to
crane,
the
iowa
supreme
court
affirmed
with
two
justices
dissenting,
although
it
recognized
that
recent
opinions
of
this
court
put
the
matter
in
some
doubt.
it
did
not
feel
free
to
depart
from
what
it
considered
older
case
law
indicating
that
all
common
law
defenses
except
assumption
of
risk
are
applicable
to
non-railroad
employees.
that
now
is
the
issue
before
the
court.
now
the
problem
arises
because
the
federal
safety
appliance
act
was
passed
in
1893
without
any
specific
reference
to
a
remedy
other
than
a
suit
for
penalties
by
the
united
states.
and
consequently,
suits
for
violation
of
this
act
were
brought
in
state
courts,
and
the
earliest
case
on
contributory
negligence
from
this
court,
the
schlemmer
case,
held
that
in
the
absence
of
legislation
at
the
time
of
the
injury
in
that
case
taking
away
the
defense,
the
common
law
controlled.
we
show
in
our
brief
how
we
think
schlemmer
was
misinterpreted
in
later
decisions,
but
in
any
event
it
certainly
true
that
between
1911
and
1935,
this
court
did
state
in
dicta
in
several
opinions
that
state
law
controlled
as
to
the
defense
of
contributory
negligence.
that
certainly
is
true.
in
the
meantime
however
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
no
sir
we
didn't.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes,
diminution
of
damages
under
comparative
negligence
would
come
into
play
only
in
a
case
under
fela
only
and
not
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--
involving
the
violation
of
the
federal
safety
appliance
act.
but
you'll
recall
that
in
fela,
as
soon
as
there
is
a
violation
of
the
federal
safety
act,
congress
made
it
very
clear
that
contributory
negligence
went
out
the
window
altogether.
right.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
now
fela
of
course
was
passed
in
1908,
and
by
itself
it
covered
only
railroad
employees.
this
act
did
set
out
a
specific
cause
of
action,
a
federal
cause
of
action.
it
provided
that
in
a
suit
under
fela
alone,
as
we've
pointed
out,
the
contributory
negligence
of
the
employee
would
diminish
damages
if
it
was
only
under
fela
and
would
do
away
with
contributory
negligence
if
a
violation
of
the
federal
safety
act
would
apply.
and
in
those
early
cases
under
both
fela
and
the
safety
act,
liability
in
those
days
was
thought
off
in
traditional
negligence
terms.
the
charges
to
the
juries
in
those
days
and
even
in
the
language
in
this
court's
opinions
in
those
early
days
talked
in
terms
of
negligence,
in
terms
of
due
care,
and
so
i
think
it's
hardly
surprising
that
this
court
in
these
early
cases
accept
that
the
general
doctrine
that
a
contributory
negligence
would
be
applicable.
but
beginning
in
the
late
1930's
a
change
began
to
take
place
in
the
reading
of
the
safety
act.
commentators
have
pointed
out
that
the
change
was
comparable
to
the
development
or
the
evolution
of
the
law
in
regard
to
interstate
commerce.
the
court
in
the
late
1930's,
sensing
that
the
restrictions
which
the
state
courts
were
placing
on
recovery
in
these
cases
was
not
the
will
of
congress,
began
requiring
stricter
standards
of
liability
by
the
railroads
for
violating
the
safety
act.
the
court
finally
said
that
liability
under
the
act
had
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
negligence,
negligence
was
completely
out
of
the
matter,
and
that
the
railroad
owed
an
absolute
duty
to
those
properly
upon
its
lines
to
maintain
its
equipment
in
efficient
condition.
and
then
in
due
course,
the
court
came
to
the
terms
absolute
liability,
and
absolute
prohibition
in
interpreting
the
safety
act.
now
the
use
of
these
terms
could
hardly
have
been
inadvertent
or
imprecise
as
suggested
by
the
iowa
supreme
court.
the
shields
case
for
example,
involved
the
employee
of
an
independent
contractor
and
therefore
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
fela,
it
was
not
brought
under
fela
at
all.
contributory
negligence
was
specifically
pleaded
as
a
defense
in
that
case.
the
trial
court
instructed
the
contributory
negligence
was
not
a
defense.
the
railroad
made
this
a
point
on
appeal
to
the
fifth
circuit.
the
fifth
circuit
specifically
said
that
the
plaintiff
was
invoking
absolute
liability.
this
court
in
its
opinion
mentioned
that
plaintiff
was
invoking
absolute
liability,
and
then
it
went
on
to
say
that
violation
of
the
act
did
result
in
absolute
liability.
now
in
the
light
of
the
record
in
the
case
like
that
to
say
that
this
court
had
merely
used
the
term
absolute
viability
loosely
or
inadvertently
of
course
we
say
simply
makes
no
sense.
what
we're
asking
here
is
that
this
safety
act
be
interpreted
in
the
light
of
the
overall
intent
of
congress,
which
was
to
impose
on
the
railroads
whatever
liability
was
necessary
to
make
them
maintain
their
equipment
in
proper
condition.
and
yet
look
what
happens
now
if
the
court
adapts
the
reasoning
of
the
respondent
in
this
case?
the
railroad
is
able
to
turn
over
a
car,
a
defective
car,
to
an
independent
third
party
such
as
cargill.
the
railroad
knows
that
it's
not
going
to
receive
that
car
back
on
its
tracks
for
a
period
of
time.
now
if
contributory
negligence
can
be
asserted
by
an
employee
of
that
third
party,
it's
very
much
to
the
advantage
of
the
railroad
to
leave
that
car
defective,
leave
it
defective,
wait
till
it
gets
back
on
its
lines
because
if
the
injury
occurs
in
the
interim,
they're
going
to
have
a
lot
easier
time
of
it.
how
could
that
possibly
have
been
the
intent
of
congress?
congress'
intent
must
have
been
to
require
the
railroad
to
fix
this
equipment
at
the
earliest
possible
time
and
to
impose
whatever
liability
that
required
them
to
do
it.
and
look
what
other
results
followed
here.
in
this
case,
the
trial
court
not
only
placed
the
burden
upon
mr.
crane
to
prove
by
a
preponderance
or
a
greater
weight
of
the
evidence
that
he
was
not
guilty
of
contributory
negligence,
but
listen
to
this.
it
instructed
that
if
his
contributory
negligence
contributed
in
any
way
or
in
any
degree
directly
to
the
injury,
he
could
not
recover
at
all.
now,
what
happens?
mr.
crane
thus
winds
up
with
less
chance
of
recovery
even
though
the
railroad
violated
the
safety
act
then
if
one
of
the
railroad's
own
employees
had
been
injured
and
the
railroad
had
been
guilty
only
of
simple
negligence,
not
even
of
a
violation
of
the
safety
act
because
in
that
case,
the
employee
could
recover
diminished
damages
but
at
least
damages
of
some
kind
whereas
in
--
in
this
case,
the
employee
of
the
third
party
can't
recover
at
all.
and
we
just
submit
that
that
could
not
possibly
have
been
the
intent
of
congress.
that
the
intent
was
entirely
the
other
way,
because
if
it's
one
thing
these
two
act
show
if
they're
read
together
it's
that
congress
was
concerned
primarily
about
violations
of
the
safety
act.
that's
what
it
was
concerned
about
if
you
compare
the
statutes
every
time
the
safety
act
is
mentioned.
liability
grows
greater,
the
standards
become
stricter.
that's
what
they
were
concerned
about,
the
thousands
of
deaths
and
injuries
that
were
occurring
because
equipment
was
improper.
now
the
type
of
interpretation
that
we
seek
here
is
certainly
nothing
new
to
the
statute.
time
and
again
this
court
has
read
the
literal
language
of
the
act
in
the
light
of
the
overall
writing
intent
of
congress.
in
once
case
for
example,
although
the
act
only
refers
to
couplers
coupling
automatically
by
impact
and
uncoupling
without
the
necessity
of
going
between
cars,
this
court
required
in
addition
that
the
couplers
remained
coupled
until
set
free
by
some
purposeful
act
of
control.
that
wasn't
in
the
statute,
but
this
court
added
it
because
it
thought
that
that
was
the
plain
meaning
of
congress
in
passing
the
statute.
in
another
case,
the
court
struck
the
fellow
servant
defense
from
safety
act
cases,
even
though
the
act
itself
made
no
reference
whatever
to
the
fellow
servant
rule,
and
the
court
said
the
obvious
purpose
of
the
legislature
was
to
supplant
the
qualified
duty
of
the
common
law
with
an
absolute
duty
deemed
by
it
nor
just.
in
still
another
case,
it
was
argued
that
the
safety
act
made
clear
by
its
various
provisions
that
it
applied
only
to
railroad
workers.
and
this
court
held
it
applicable
to
motorist
on
the
highway
as
well
who
came
across
the
tracks
and
any
one
else
as
a
matter
fact
who
were
properly
on
the
railroads
properly.
and
still
again
the
court
ruled
that
assumption
of
risk
was
just
as
applicable
to
employees
of
a
connecting
carrier
as
it
was
to
the
defendant
railroad,
even
though
the
assumption
of
risk
provision
would
seem
to
have
been
applicable
only
to
employees
of
the
guilty
carrier.
and
in
that
case,
it's
interesting
that
the
court
relied
on
both
fela
and
the
safety
act
even
though
the
case
was
brought
only
under
the
safety
act.
now
this
brings
me
to
the
point
that
has
been
emphasized
by
the
court
so
strongly
many
times,
and
that
is
that
the
safety
act
and
fela
are
really
correlative,
interdependent,
interrelated
statutes,
each
gain
sustenance
from
the
other,
each
must
be
read
in
the
light
of
the
other
and
we
say
that
the
specific
abolition
of
the
defense
of
contributory
negligence
in
fela
permeates
the
entire
safety
act.
in
other
words,
so
long
as
the
injured
party
is
one
who
is
covered
by
the
safety
act,
which
is
clearly
the
case,
concededly
the
case
here,
the
railroad
should
not
be
able
to
use
contributory
negligence
to
defeat
him
any
more
that
it
can
now
use
assumption
of
risk
to
defeat
him
or
the
fellow
servant
doctrine
to
defeat
him.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
correct.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
correct.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
let
me
put
it
this
way
mr.
justice,
i'm
not
urging
the
construction
you've
mentioned
at
first
simply
because
i
don't
think
it's
necessary.
i
think
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well
you
say
to
treat
him
as
if
he
was
in
fact
a
railroad
employee.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
the
reason
it
wasn't
is
that
fela
on
its
face
applies
only
to
railroad
workers.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes,
although
i
might
put
it
a
little
differently,
i
would
say
that
i'm
asking
you
to
realize
that
congress
could
not
possibly
have
met
to
discriminate
against
non-railway
employees
leaving
these
two
statutes
together.
it
could
not
possibly
have
met
to
allow
a
railroad
employee
to
recover,
and
a
non-railroad
employee
properly
upon
the
property,
properly
working
on
these
cars
not
to
recover
under
precisely
the
same
circumstances.
i
think
congress's
intent,
if
you
read
these
two
statutes
together
as
the
court
have
said
you
must
do,
is
clearly
to
impose
as
the
court
itself
have
said
absolute
liability
in
either
instance.
in
the
(inaudible)
case,
it
was
not
under
fela
either
your
honor,
and
yet
the
court
said
there
was
absolute
liability.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i
agree
that
it's
not
inconceivable,
but
if
your
honor
will
look
at
the
legislative
history
you'll
find
that
congress
clearly
recognized
right
from
the
beginning
that
others
--
other
than
railroad
employees
were
going
to
be
clearly
affected.
it
provided
in
the
preamble
to
the
act,
for
example,
that
this
act
was
an
act
to
promote
the
safety
of
employees
and
travelers
by
--
upon
railroads
by
compelling.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
that's
correct
sir,
and
i'm
saying
that
the
safety
act
provision
in
fela,
that
is
the
provision
that
once
the
safety
act
is
violated
in
fela,
you
have
a
higher
standard
clearly
implies
that
the
--
that
once
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well
the
fela
of
course
was
passed
later,
passed
in
1908,
and
the
--
and
that
statute
provides
as
you
know
simply
that
once
the
safety
appliance
act
is
violated
that
contributory
negligence
goes
out.
this
court
has
gone
on
in
later
cases
to
make
clear
the
class
of
people
who
are
covered
by
the
safety
appliance
act
greatly
broadening
it,
and
that
we
simply
say
that
this
court
has
recognized
that
you're
not
going
to
discriminate
when
you
read
these
two
cases
--
these
two
acts
together
unless
you
find
specific
congressional
intent
to
rule
out
this
kind
of
interpretation.
and
we
certainly
find
no
legislative
history
of
any
kind
indicating
any
attempt
to
discriminate
against
or
make
the
burden
greater
for
the
non-railroad
employee.
i
grant
your
honor
that
perhaps
would
not
be
beyond
the
power
of
congress
to
do
so,
but
the
point
of
it
is
that
we
can't
find
any
indication
that
they
did
intend
to
do
so.
now
we
pointed
in
our
brief
to
all
kinds
of
defenses
that
the
states
could
use
and
they're
presently
using
in
their
state
cases
in
ordinary
negligence
actions
to
defeat
claims
by
plaintiffs.
and
if
all
these
are
applicable
in
the
respective
states
under
this
federal
statute,
we
say
it's
going
to
encourage
exactly
what
congress
was
attempting
to
frustrate
namely
a
spotty
and
differing
recovery
in
each
state
under
this
federal
statue
depending
upon
whether
the
local
rule
happens
to
be
stringent
or
liberal
in
the
particular
case.
so
in
summary
we
say
that
absent,
the
specific
intent
to
discriminate
that
the
courts
use
of
the
term
absolute
liability
in
recent
years
in
these
cases
was
purposeful
that
so
long
is
there
is
a
defect
as
there
clearly
was
here.
so
long
as
there
is
a
cause
or
relationship
between
the
defect
and
the
injury
that
liability
automatically
follows.
we
submit
that
we're
long
past
the
day
when
an
employee
merely
because
of
some
negligent
act
no
matter
how
slight,
thereby
excludes
himself
from
all
recovery
under
remedial
legislation
of
this
kind.
i'll
save
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal
if
i
may
sir.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
mr.
justice
white,
you
put
finger
exactly
on
the
point
here.
of
course
there
is
a
cause
of
action.
this
court
has
said
so
in
unmistakable
language,
it
said,
"a
failure
of
equipment
to
perform
as
required
by
the
federal
safety
appliance
act
is
in
itself
an
actionable
wrong."
that's
what
you
said
in
o'donnell.
is
in
itself
an
actionable
wrong
in
no
way
depended
upon
negligence.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
that
is
the
point.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
what
mr.
dallas
is
really
arguing
about
is
whether
there
is
a
federal
cause
of
action
and
i
think
myself
that
that
is
questionable.
i
don't
think
that's
been
finally
decided.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
there
is
clearly
a
cause
of
action
under
federal
law
which
can
be
brought
in
the
state
courts
and
even
schlemmer
said
that
it
is
a
federal
question
whether
a
particular
defense
could
be
asserted
when
--
under
the
federal
safety
appliance
act.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
exactly.
so
what
do
you
have?
you
have
this
court
saying
that
under
these
federal
statutes
brought
in
state
court,
we
must
look
to
federal
standards
to
see
defenses
and
other
matters
which
go
directly
to
the
question
of
liability.
alright,
now
what
is
this
court
going
to
say
the
federal
standard
is?
is
it
going
to
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i'm
sorry
sir?
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
it
has,
that's
my
feeling.
it
said
he
talks
about
a
rule
of
law
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
no
sir,
no
sir.
he's
--
he
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
unless
with
a
possible
exception
of
schlemmer.
i
think
that
schlemmer
doesn't
stand
for
the
outright
proposition
that
contributory
negligence
is
a
defense,
but
if
you
disagree
with
me
then
yes
you
have
to
overrule
schlemmer.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i
don't
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
in
schlemmer,
if
you
interpret
it
that
way,
it
did.
in
the
other
cases
following
schlemmer
it
was
entirely
dicta
because
the
jury
verdicts
were
always
with
plaintiff.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
no
and
i
think
the
reason
is
and
this
is
the
point
i
wanted
to
make
was
that
i
think
this
doctrine
is
dead
anyway.
it
isn't
a
doctrine
of
60
years
that
hasn't
been
overruled,
if
you
go
to
these
cases
like
shields
and
affolder
and
carter
and
o'donnell
and
brady
and
meyers,
what
is
it
mean
if
they're
not
talking
in
terms
of
absolute
liability
and
absolute
prohibition.
they're
not
just
talking
about
absolute
duty
as
mr.
dallas
would
have
you
believe,
they
talk
about
absolute
liability
and
absolute
liability
means
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i
can
give
you
a
case
your
honor
where
assumption
of
risk
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes
but
only
--
it
would
seem
as
to

mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes,
my
--
it's
my
position
that
it
was
in
shields.
it
was
pleaded
in
shields,
it
was
clearly
presented,
i
contend
in
the
instructions
to
shields
at
least
they
objected
to
the
instruction
that
the
contributory
negligence
was
deemed
not
to
be
a
defense
in
that
case,
and
shields
was
solely
under
the
safety
appliance
act,
not
under
fela.
not
it's
my
position
that
fela
chose
the
way
only
in
terms
to
the
legislative
intent
to
make
this
act
one
of
absolute
liability
and
that
in
no
other
way
can
you
possibly
carry
out
the
intent
of
congress.
if
you're
going
to
say
that
is
the
federal
standard
that
contributory
negligence
applies,
if
the
state
says
so,
you
end
up
with
a
case
like
this
one
where
a
jury
is
allowed
to
conclude
that
if
there
was
contributory
negligence
in
any
way
or
in
any
degree,
this
man
gets
nothing.
i
say
that
could
not
conceivably
have
been
the
intent
of
congress.
and
your
honor,
the
only
thing
i
would
note
in
addition
to
that
is
that
there
was
a
mention
of
this
emergency
instruction
in
an
attempt
to
show
that
really
what
went
to
jury
was
fair.
i
need
only
say
that
we
clearly
told
the
court
that
that
instruction
was
given
solely
because
with
our
contributory
negligence
argument
had
been
rejected.
if
you're
going
to
talk
about
unfairness,
let's
look
at
this
man
who
had
been
employed
for
six
months,
who
admittedly
was
not
a
railroad
worker,
who
did
not
know
anything
about
couplers
and
yet
he
is
deemed
to
be
contributory
negligent
because
he
didn't
see
the
pin
drop,
or
he
didn't
stretch
the
cars.
that
is
where
the
unfairness
comes
in
these
cases,
and
that
clearly
is
not
what
congress
intended
when
it
said
that
the
railroads
had
to
keep
this
equipment
in
effective
conditions.
thank
you.
