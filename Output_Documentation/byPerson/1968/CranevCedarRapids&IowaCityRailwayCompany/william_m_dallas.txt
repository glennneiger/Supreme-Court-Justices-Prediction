mr.
william
m.
dallas
mr.
justice.
your
honor
put
the
finger
on
the
very
pulse
of
this
problem
here
and
the
question
is
and
the
honorable
court
decided
it
on
the
basis
that
this
was
an
action
brought
by
a
nonemployee
of
the
railroad
and
that
only
on
those
instances
were
the
action
was
brought
by
a
railroad
employee,
was
the
plaintiff
entitled
to
claim
the
benefits
of
the
federal
employer's
liability
act?
and
the
court
cited
the
many,
many
cases
that
had
been
decided
by
this
court
which
held
that
contributory
negligence
was
a
defense
in
all
of
those
actions
except
for
the
federal
employer's
liability
act
was
involved.
and
what
we
in
effect
have
here
is
an
endeavor
to
reverse
a
construction
of
the
federal
employer's
liability
act
that
has
been
existent
for
almost
60
years.
the
very
first
case
that
this
court
had
occasioned
to
pass
on
the
federal
safety
appliance
act
was
the
first
--
was
the
schlemmer
case,
it
was
decided
in
220
u.s,
and
that
was
an
action
that
involved
an
injury
to
a
railroad
employee
in
a
situation
where
the
injury
occurred
prior
to
the
time
of
the
adoption
of
the
federal
employer's
liability
act.
the
case
was
tried
to
a
jury
in
the
state
court
and
the
jury
returned
the
verdict
in
favor
of
the
plaintiff
under
instructions
with
respect
to
contributory
negligence.
the
state
trial
court
granted
the
judgment
not
withstanding
the
verdict
on
the
theory
that
the
plaintiff
was
guilty
of
contributory
negligence
as
a
matter
of
law.
it
was
then
appealled
to
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
and
they
held
that
the
plaintiff
under
the
--
the
dissident
in
that
case
under
the
facts
of
that
particular
case
was
guilty
of
contributory
negligence.
as
a
matter
of
law
and
said
in
this
--
and
then
the
case
came
here,
this
court
said
the
contributory
negligence
continues
as
a
defense
unless
it
is
taken
away
by
statute.
there
was
no
statute
at
the
time
this
action
occurred
which
took
it
away
therefore
it
continues
to
be
a
defense.
now
i
want
to
just
say
a
word
or
two
about
that
schlemmer
case
because
of
the
contentions
that
are
made
with
respect
to
it
in
petitioner's
brief.
they
say
that
this
court
has
misinterpret
over
the
many
years
the
true
import
of
the
schlemmer
opinion.
now
the
schlemmer
case
all
very
definitely
discusses
what
is
contributory
negligence?
namely
the
failure
of
a
party
to
take
those
precautions
for
his
own
safety
that
another
reasonably
prudent
person
would
under
the
same
or
similar
circumstance.
now
they
say
applying
that
rule
to
the
facts
of
that
case,
the
state
court
was
correct
in
concluding
that
the
dissident
failed
to
take
those
precautions
and
he
was
not
entitled
to
recover
because
contributory
negligence
continued
to
be
a
defense.
now
the
next
case
that
we
have
after
that
arose
under
the
act
of
1893
which
was
the
original
federal
safety
appliance
act
then
in
1908
we
have
the
federal
employer's
liability
act.
but
as
you
recall
under
the
federal
employer's
liability
act
as
it
was
first
enacted,
it
only
covered
those
employees
who
were
actually
engaged
in
interstate
commerce.
so
the
person
could
be
a
railroad
employee
and
if
his
activities
at
the
time
of
his
injury
were
intrastate
activities
then
he
was
not
entitled
to
the
benefits
of
the
federal
employer's
liability
act.
so
he
stood
in
the
same
posture
with
respect
to
his
claim
that
the
ordinary
individual
who
was
not
a
railroad
employee
he
was.
we
had
a
series
of
cases
that
articulated
the
import
of
the
schlemmer
case,
applied
that
rule,
carried
it
on
and
held
that
insofar
as
the
federal
safety
appliance
act
was
concerned,
of
course
a
federal
question
was
presented
as
to
what
its
proper
construction
was.
what
they
said
that
an
injured
party
who
was
not
entitled
to
the
benefits
of
the
federal
employers
liability
act
did
not
have
a
federally
created
cause
of
action.
that
this
duty
to
have
cars
equipped
with
those
appliances
which
were
in
conformity
with
the
safety
appliance
act
was
an
absolute
duty.
the
only
effect
of
the
federal
safety
appliance
act
was
to
substitute
a
strict
and
absolute
obligations
specified
by
statute
in
lieu
of
the
ordinary
common
law
obligation
to
maintain
your
cars
in
a
reasonably
safe
condition.
now
true
and
from
the
very
beginning,
this
court
has
held
that
that
is
a
absolute
requirement,
impose
an
absolute
duty
to
comply
over
those
strict
requirements
of
the
federal
safety
appliance
act
and
its
obligation
that
cannot
be
avoided
by
any
degree
of
care
no
matter
however
assiduous
as
justice
hughes,
the
chief
justice
hughes
said
in
the
brady
case.
so
we
come
into
a
situation
here
when
we
start
out
any
person
injured
as
a
result
of
a
defective
federal
appliance,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
who
that
person
is,
is
entitled
to
the
benefits
of
that
federal
safety
appliance
act.
he
may
be
a
person
approaching
the
railroad,
crossing
it,
may
be
a
man
climbing
on
a
car,
any
person
as
you
very,
very
distinctly
said
who
needs
the
protection
of
that
federal
safety
appliance
act
is
entitled
to
it.
and
that
duty
is
an
absolute
duty
in
one
that
can
result
in
a
situation
where
a
person
injured
can
impose
liability
upon
a
railroad
without
fault,
and
you
can
have
a
situation
here
where
you,
as
we
say
under
the
facts
of
this
very
case.
if
liability
were
to
be
imposed
here,
it
would
be
without
fault
on
that
part
of
the
cedar
rapids
and
iowa
city
railroad
because
at
that
the
time
these
cars
were
delivered,
they
were
firmly
coupled
together
at
the
time
they
were
uncoupled
by
these
men
who
were
employees
of
cargill
for
the
purpose
of
weighing.
the
couplers
were
functioning
in
perfect
order.
it
was
no
dispute
but
what
these
cars
at
the
time
they
were
delivered
were
in
absolute
perfect
condition.
now,
we
have
a
situation
here
where
this
case
was
brought
as
it
could
be
in
three
counts.
one,
ordinary
common
law
negligence
for
delivering
a
car
that
was
not
equipped
with
proper
couplers.
two,
failure
to
deliver
the
car
that
was
in
conformity
with
the
federal
safety
appliance
act.
three,
res
ipsa
loquitur.
at
the
conclusion
of
plaintiff's
case,
the
court
directed
a
verdict
against
the
plaintiff
on
all
claims
that
were
based
on
common
law
negligence
because
viewing
the
evidence
from
the
like
most
(inaudible)
the
plaintiff.
the
jury
were
to
found
that
there
had
been
any
negligence
on
the
part
of
the
railroad
company
in
delivering
those
cars,
that
verdict
would
not
have
had
any
support
in
the
evidence.
so
the
case
proceeded
to
trial
on
this
single
count
before
the
jury.
now
in
connection
with
the
situation
as
it
presented,
there
it
was
urged
throughout
the
trial,
that
contributory
negligence
was
not
a
defense.
and
when
the
district
court
or
the
trial
court
held
that
it
--
contributory
negligence
was
available
as
a
defense
then
the
petitioner
requested
a
so-called
emergency
instruction
which
told
the
jury
that
they
found
that
the
plaintiff
was
confronted
with
a
sudden
emergency
so
that
he
was
required
to
act
under
circumstances,
or
he
didn't
have
time
for
adequate
deliberation
then
he
would
not
be
held
to
that
degree
of
care
that
a
person
would
be
who
was
not
confronted
with
such
an
emergency,
but
he
would
only
be
required
to
use
that
care
for
his
own
safety.
that
a
reasonably
prudent
person
would
be
required
to
use
under
the
same
or
similar
circumstance,
so
we
have
a
fair,
fair
submission,
it's
not
any
lopsided
submission
at
all.
the
iowa
court
said
that
the
instructions
with
respect
to
contributory
negligence
were
in
full
conformity
with
the
iowa
law.
now
you're
not
going
to
find
that
instruction
in
there
your
honor.
you'll
find
it
set
out
in
my
--
in
our
brief
in
the
statement
of
facts
certainly,
and
they
did
not
set
it
out
here
and
i'm
reading
it.
i
set
it
out
here
on
page
4
of
the
brief
for
respondent,
this
is
the
instruction
that
they
requested
and
this
is
what
was
given.
when
one
is
confronted
with
a
sudden
emergency
not
brought
about
by
his
own
fault
and
because
the
railroad
is
required
to
act
upon
the
impulse
of
the
moment
without
sufficient
time
to
determine
with
certainty
the
best
course
to
pursue
is
not
held
to
the
same
accuracy
of
judgment
as
would
be
required
of
him
who
had
time
for
deliberation.
under
such
circumstances,
he
was
required
to
act
only
as
an
ordinarily
careful
and
prudent
person
would
act
when
suddenly
placed
in
the
similar
position,
and
he'd
be
so
acts
he
is
not
liable
for
injury
or
damage
resulting
from
his
conduct.
mr.
william
m.
dallas
that's
right
your
honor,
that's
in
accordance
with
the
iowa
law
and
the
iowa
supreme
court
said
that
was
a
correct
statement
of
the
iowa
law
in
contributory
negligence.
mr.
william
m.
dallas
that's
right,
that's
right.
now
that
gets
to
the
very
pith
of
our
problem.
if
you
were
to
say
that
you
had
a
federally
created
cause
of
action
here,
then
you'd
have
a
situation
where
you
could
not
deviate
from
those
federal
rules
and
that's
where
you
get
into
these
lines
of
cases.
some
of
them
you
have
here
where
the
action
was
brought
under
the
federal
safety
appliance
act,
and
then
the
court
endeavored
to
inject
into
that
case.
some
local
rule
that
was
common
to
the
local
jurisdiction.
mr.
william
m.
dallas
that's
right,
excuse
me.
mr.
william
m.
dallas
that's
right,
i
--
excuse
me
for
correcting
my
misapplication
of
the
word.
now
urging,
you
have
those
situations
then.
you
have
no
right
of
course
to
inject
some
local
rule
that
may
result
in
a
lack
of
uniformity
in
the
procedure.
but
here
the
court
has
always
held
that
you
have
no
federally
created
cause
of
action
here.
and
as
the
cases
have
said
so
frequently,
the
breach
of
this
duty,
the
violation
of
the
federal
safety
appliance
act,
merely
gives
rise
to
a
situation
where
an
injured
person
must
look
to
the
applicable
state
law
for
the
remedy
to
recover
damages
for
that
breach.
and
that
is
precisely
what
the
iowa
court
said
in
applying
these
earlier
cases
and
said
that
there's
been
--
those
cases
had
never
been
overruled.
now
just
one
--
mr.
william
m.
dallas
before
the
luncheon
i
had
mentioned
these
previous
cases
that
had
been
decided
by
this
court
in
the
construction
which
this
court
had
given
to
the
federal
safety
appliance
act.
and
i
feel
that
a
reading
of
those
cases
does
not
permit
any
other
conclusion
other
than
the
fact
that
in
the
instances
where
a
person
who
is
injured
has
the
right
to
the
benefits
of
the
federal
employer's
liability
act
that
the
--
all
the
common
law
defenses
are
available.
now
that
is
the
situation
that
there
can
be
no
escape
from
that
conclusion.
now
true,
you
have
a
situation
here
where
this
court
is
the
final
(inaudible),
what
the
federal
employer's
liability
act
should
--
ought
--
should
be
properly
construe.
but
we
say
that
--
mr.
william
m.
dallas
federal
safety
appliance
act,
excuse
me
your
honor,
i'm
--
if
it
wasn't
for
you
gentlemen
keeping
me
in
line
here,
i
had
to
be
making
some
serious
mr.
william
m.
dallas
--
mistakes.
mr.
william
m.
dallas
that's
right.
i
know,
--
(inaudible)
any
confusion.
in
other
words,
that
brings
us
down
to
three
of
the
more
recent
cases,
the
o'donnell
case,
the
carter
case
and
the
affolder
case.
they
were
all
automatic
coupler
cases
that
were
decided
within
a
period
of
very
few
months
of
each
other.
those
were
all
instances
where
the
court
had
an
instance
of
injury
to
a
railroad
employee.
his
action
was
brought
under
the
employer's
liability
act.
and
in
those
cases
the
court
made
pronouncements
as
to
the
fact
that
negligence
on
the
part
of
the
railroad.
the
failure
to
comply
with
the
requirements
of
the
federal
safety
appliance
act
those
requirements,
were
absolute,
and
negligence
was
not
an
issue
with
respect
to
such
compliance.
now
there
isn't
any
--
the
cases
in
mr.
justice
jackson
when
he
wrote
the
opinion
in
the
o'donnell
case,
cited
cases
that
were
decided
long
prior
to
the
cases
to
which
i
have
made
reference
here.
insofar
of
his
conclusion
that
negligence
was
not
an
issue
or
any
legal
excuse
would
not
be
available
to
a
defense
as
--
a
defense
to
a
railroad,
like
you
would
have
in
the
ordinary
state
statute
where
you
have
a
violation,
a
technical
violation.
but
if
the
party
was
able
to
show
that
he'd
used
every
precaution
that
was
humanly
possible
to
avoid
a
violation,
why
then,
it
would
be
up
to
the
jury
to
say,
?well,
he
has
a
legal
excuse
if
he
finds
that
he
did
everything
reasonably
possible
to
avoid
compliance.?
but
that
defense
is
not
available
to
a
violation
of
the
federal
safety
appliance
act.
and
that
--
mr.
william
m.
dallas
he
doesn't
have
to
prove
negligence
at
all
and
he
didn't
have
--
mr.
william
m.
dallas
well,
because
the
federal
statute,
perhaps
the
best
illustration
that
i
can
give
--
mr.
william
m.
dallas
in
other
words
if
the
--
mr.
william
m.
dallas
your
honor
i
like
that
you
--
mr.
william
m.
dallas
i
think
you've
pointed
up
before
our
line
of
demarcation
is.
a
violation
of
the
federal
statute
constitutes
a
violation
of
an
absolute
duty,
and
we
cannot
escape
the
conformity
without
duty
by
showing
any
degree
of
care.
but
that's
only
one
of
the
ingredients
of
a
cause
of
action.
in
other
words
looking
to
the
federal
safety
appliance
act
alone
it
doesn't
create
any
cause
of
action,
that's
what
it's
been
so
many
times
held.
in
other
words
as
justice
clark
said
in
the
affolder
case,
it
--
mr.
william
m.
dallas
he
sues
on
a
violation
of
the
federal
safety
appliance
act
as
creating
the
wrong
or
the
breach
of
duty
that
--
as
owed
to
him.
mr.
william
m.
dallas
not
a
cause,
not
a
complete,
not
a
cause
of
action
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
william
m.
dallas
no
but
he
must
look
to
the
state
law
for
causation,
for
proximate
cause
and
the
other
elements
that
--
mr.
william
m.
dallas
yes
to
look
to
--
that's
right,
that's
what
you
said
many
times.
mr.
william
m.
dallas
well,
in
other
words
he
must
look
to
those
requirements
of
the
state
law
for
what
is
an
actionable
wrong.
in
other
words,
the
wrong,
the
breach
of
duty
occurred
but
--
mr.
william
m.
dallas
but
the
state
is
not
permitted
to
say
that
your
honor,
your
federal
--
mr.
william
m.
dallas
well,
because
the
violation
of
the
safety
appliance
act
--
mr.
william
m.
dallas
--
does
not
--
mr.
william
m.
dallas
--
does
not
mean
a
cause
of
action.
mr.
william
m.
dallas
that's
--
in
other
words,
the
safety
appliance
act
is
just
a
criminal
statute
that's
all
it
amounted
to.
and
the
court
has
given
it
a
construction
that
says
that
that
is
composed
the
absolute
duties
to
comply,
and
as
justice
sullivan
--
mr.
william
m.
dallas
well
in
other
words
i
don't
say
--
mr.
william
m.
dallas
well
no,
and
that's
where
we
get
into
this
confusion
when
we
talk
about
absolute
liability
and
absolute
duty,
and
that's
where
i
think
we
get
into
the
problems
and
i'm
going
to
avert
to
that
aspect
of
the
case
in
a
moment.
but
here,
to
put
it
this
way,
the
--
in
the
fairport
case,
which
is
the
first
case
that
where
a
person
approached
a
railroad
crossing
and
he
was
struck
by
train
that
didn't
have
the
proper
power
brakes
as
required
by
section
1
of
the
federal
safety
appliance
act.
then
the
question
got
into
the
case
as
to
whether
contributory
negligence
of
this
person
approaching
the
railroad
crossing
would
be
a
defense,
or
more
properly
speaking,
in
that
case
whether
last
search
chance
was
available
to
avoid
the
consequences
of
failure
to
use
proper
precautions
when
approaching
the
crossing.
and
this
is
what
justice
sullivan
in
that
fairport
case,
he
said,
"the
effect
of
the
federal
safety
appliance
act
is
to
transform
a
common
law
duty
to
use
ordinary
care
into
an
absolute
duty
which
is
imposed
by
statute"
and
that
absolute
duty
cannot
be
escaped
by
a
showing
of
care
on
the
part
of
the
railroad,
but
that's
only
in
one
side
of
the
aspect,
he
has
to
look
further
to
the
state
law
to
--
the
right
as
they
say
springs
from
the
state
law
to
recover.
so
they
must
look
to
the
state
law
to
see
whether
the
state
law
permits
or
whether
he's
got
approximate
causation
or
whether
he
has
--
mr.
william
m.
dallas
that's
right,
in
other
words,
and
that's
why
they're
endeavoring
to
say
your
honor
that
your
earlier
cases
had
held
that
there's
nothing
in
the
federal
safety
appliance
act
which
took
away
the
defense
of
contributory
negligence.
that's
the
exact
language
of
the
schlemmer
case
and
in
the
absence
of
something
taking
it
away
why
it
continues
to
exist.
now
that's
--
and
that
is
where
you're
asked
to
depart
from
those
earlier
cases,
and
now
take
on
the
different
view
on
the
theory
that
there's
been
a
change
of
philosophy
with
respect
to
that
and
that's
what
i
want
to
get
into
a
minute
here.
mr.
william
m.
dallas
yes
sir
your
honor.
mr.
william
m.
dallas
well,
there's
--
a
number
of
those
cases
your
honor
where
they've
said
that
they
would
constitute
--
i
assume
that
you'd
not
have
any
elements
of
contributory
negligence
or
with
those
other
--
mr.
william
m.
dallas
well,
in
other
words
--
i'm
not
--
mr.
william
m.
dallas
what
i
am
endeavoring
to
say
is
this,
that
the
way
the
statute
has
been
construed
up
to
now,
they've
said
that
it
did
not
provide
a
complete
cause
of
action
and
you
had
to
look
beyond
the
safety
appliance
act
for
certain
other
elements
that
were
essential
to
a
complete
cause
of
action.
and
in
the
case
of
the
injured
employee,
he
looked
to
the
federal
employer's
liability
act,
and
as
you
said
in
the
carter
case,
the
wrong
that
resulted
from
a
violation
of
a
safety
appliance
act
provided
the
element
that
gave
him
the
cause
of
action
under
the
federal
employer's
liability
act.
now
we
have
no
counter
part
of
that
unless
you're
going
to
say
that
all
people
whether
they
be
employees
or
not
should
be
treated
on
a
same
basis.
mr.
william
m.
dallas
no
that's
not
--
that's
not
your
honor,
in
other
words,
in
fact
i
realized
your
--
the
--
that's
been
quite
the
contrary
you're
holding
here
in
your
view
at
coray
versus
southern
pacific
railroad
case.
you
held
that
quite
to
the
contrary
and
that
case
that
that
--
mr.
william
m.
dallas
well,
you
spoke
for
the
court
but
--
(inaudible).
and
you
have
said
that
that
federal
safety
appliance
act
provided
a
--
or
protection
to
whoever
got
hurt
as
a
result
of
it
and
that's
been
the
whole
import
of
the
federal
safety
appliance
act.
it
was
not
a
statue
that
was
enacted
for
the
benefit
of
any
railroad
employees
alone
or
any
particular
person
who
might
be
doing
any
particular
thing
if
the
time
he
was
injured.
in
other
words
it
was
a
broad
thing
to
protect
the
public
generally
against
injuries
as
you
--
as
the
court
said
in
that
case
from
any
defective
appliance
that
was
used
and
then
--
so
then
we
start
out
here
that
every
member
of
the
public,
it's
not
a
statute
of
the
type
that
you
have
--
not
a
case
in
where
you
have
a
statute
enacted
for
the
benefit
of
minors,
for
example.
and
you
--
now
you
say
well
you
can't
plead
contributory
negligence
in
that
because
that
--
this
is
a
statute,
as
they
say
it's
enacted
for
the
benefit
of
those
people
who
aren't
able
to
protect
themselves,
that's
the
general
type.
now
this
statute
has
never
been
protected
--
has
never
been
construed
in
that
aspect
at
all,
so
that
you
have
a
situation
where
you
must
look
further.
now,
i
see
my
time
is
fast
passing,
i
want
to
just
say
a
word
for
concluding
about
the
shields
case
here,
which
is
the
case
to
which
mr.
prettyman
has
referred.
now
that's
a
case
and
i
have
read
with
very
great
interest.
the
official
transcript
in
that
case
which
sets
out
all
the
instructions
of
the
trial
court
and
so
forth,
and
i
think
that
if
you
follow
that
case
down
you'll
find
everything
that
he
says
is
true
with
respect
to
it,
except
there
was
no
instruction
given
in
that
case
by
the
trial
court
either
oral
or
written,
at
least
it's
not
set
out
in
the
record.
with
respect
to
the
question
of
the
plaintiff's
contributory
negligence
and
they
tried
this
case
both
on
two
counts,
one
on
common
law
negligence
and
the
other
on
the
violation
of
the
federal
safety
appliance
act.
and
there
was
no
instruction
on
either,
and
the
reason,
it's
rather
obvious
because
the
railroad
was
endeavoring
to
make
a
defense
in
that
case
on
the
theory
that
the
defect
on
that
so-called
running
board
had
been
painted
over
so
that
their
inspector
as
well
as
the
plaintiff
couldn't
determine
whether
there
was
any
defect
on
it.
therefore,
they
were
trying
to
make
a
defense
on
the
theory
that
they
couldn't
know
about
it
and
the
plaintiff
couldn't
either.
and
so
the
case
went
to
the
jury
and
the
jury
returned
the
verdict
for
the
plaintiff
on
both
counts,
and
then
when
it
got
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
you'll
notice
on
the
fifth
circuit
they
discussed
only
the
question
and
they
defeated
the
plaintiff
solely
on
the
grounds
that
this
so-called
running
board
was
not
a
safety
appliance
within
the
meaning
of
the
federal
safety
appliance
act.
and
they
dismissed
his
case
then
it
came
here
on
--
to
review
in
the
single
question
for
decision
here
was
whether
this
so-called
dome
step
or
running
board
was
a
safety
appliance
within
the
meaning
of
the
act.
that
caused
the
further
problem
as
to
whether
he
had
to
be
a
member
of
the
general
public
or
would
he
have
to
be
a
railroad
employee
to
claim
the
benefits
of
the
act.
and
the
court
said
that
this
was
a
safety
appliance
that
ended
that.
then
the
next
they
said,
well,
he
was
a
member
who
was
entitled
to
the
protection
of
the
act.
and
that
is
here
where
we
get
the
language
that's
been
the
subject
matter
of
our
haggling,
therefore
the
liability
is
absolute.
now
there
wasn't
any
intention
we
say
in
that
case
to
reverse
these
earlier
cases
at
all.
in
fact
the
court
as
one
of
the
cases
cited
is
the
fairport
case
which
very
definitely
and
specifically
held
that
last
clear
chance
was
available
as
a
--
it
was
a
local
problem,
it
didn't
present
a
federal
question
at
all.
therefore
you
have
a
situation
where
we
say
that
that
case
is
not
--
there
was
no
issue
of
contributory
negligence
in
that
case
at
all
when
it
reached
this
court.
and
there
wasn't
any
in
it
--
on
it
--
reached
the
fifth
circuit,
because
when
you
read
over
the
instructions,
you'll
find
that
the
court
never
gave
an
instruction
on
contributory
negligence.
true
as
mr.
prettyman
says,
the
railroad
accepted
to
the
court
in
instructing
the
--
or
that
the
contributory
negligence
would
not
constitute
a
defense,
but
there
wasn't
any
such
instruction
given
there,
if
it
wasn't,
never
got
into
the
printed
record.
so
your
honors,
we
submit
that
the
iowa
court
was
correct
in
the
concluding
that
contributory
negligence
was
available
on
the
defense
through
an
action
by
a
non-railroad
employee
and
that
these
cases
were
correctly
decided,
and
that
there's
been
no
reason
why
the
rule
should
not
be
followed
as
it
was
before.
and
to
ask
the
court
to
remedy
a
situation
now
that
has
existed
for
60
years,
we
say
is
a
matter
for
congress
rather
than
for
the
court.
mr.
william
m.
dallas
mr.
justice.
your
honor
put
the
finger
on
the
very
pulse
of
this
problem
here
and
the
question
is
and
the
honorable
court
decided
it
on
the
basis
that
this
was
an
action
brought
by
a
nonemployee
of
the
railroad
and
that
only
on
those
instances
were
the
action
was
brought
by
a
railroad
employee,
was
the
plaintiff
entitled
to
claim
the
benefits
of
the
federal
employer's
liability
act?
and
the
court
cited
the
many,
many
cases
that
had
been
decided
by
this
court
which
held
that
contributory
negligence
was
a
defense
in
all
of
those
actions
except
for
the
federal
employer's
liability
act
was
involved.
and
what
we
in
effect
have
here
is
an
endeavor
to
reverse
a
construction
of
the
federal
employer's
liability
act
that
has
been
existent
for
almost
60
years.
the
very
first
case
that
this
court
had
occasioned
to
pass
on
the
federal
safety
appliance
act
was
the
first
--
was
the
schlemmer
case,
it
was
decided
in
220
u.s,
and
that
was
an
action
that
involved
an
injury
to
a
railroad
employee
in
a
situation
where
the
injury
occurred
prior
to
the
time
of
the
adoption
of
the
federal
employer's
liability
act.
the
case
was
tried
to
a
jury
in
the
state
court
and
the
jury
returned
the
verdict
in
favor
of
the
plaintiff
under
instructions
with
respect
to
contributory
negligence.
the
state
trial
court
granted
the
judgment
not
withstanding
the
verdict
on
the
theory
that
the
plaintiff
was
guilty
of
contributory
negligence
as
a
matter
of
law.
it
was
then
appealled
to
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
and
they
held
that
the
plaintiff
under
the
--
the
dissident
in
that
case
under
the
facts
of
that
particular
case
was
guilty
of
contributory
negligence.
as
a
matter
of
law
and
said
in
this
--
and
then
the
case
came
here,
this
court
said
the
contributory
negligence
continues
as
a
defense
unless
it
is
taken
away
by
statute.
there
was
no
statute
at
the
time
this
action
occurred
which
took
it
away
therefore
it
continues
to
be
a
defense.
now
i
want
to
just
say
a
word
or
two
about
that
schlemmer
case
because
of
the
contentions
that
are
made
with
respect
to
it
in
petitioner's
brief.
they
say
that
this
court
has
misinterpret
over
the
many
years
the
true
import
of
the
schlemmer
opinion.
now
the
schlemmer
case
all
very
definitely
discusses
what
is
contributory
negligence?
namely
the
failure
of
a
party
to
take
those
precautions
for
his
own
safety
that
another
reasonably
prudent
person
would
under
the
same
or
similar
circumstance.
now
they
say
applying
that
rule
to
the
facts
of
that
case,
the
state
court
was
correct
in
concluding
that
the
dissident
failed
to
take
those
precautions
and
he
was
not
entitled
to
recover
because
contributory
negligence
continued
to
be
a
defense.
now
the
next
case
that
we
have
after
that
arose
under
the
act
of
1893
which
was
the
original
federal
safety
appliance
act
then
in
1908
we
have
the
federal
employer's
liability
act.
but
as
you
recall
under
the
federal
employer's
liability
act
as
it
was
first
enacted,
it
only
covered
those
employees
who
were
actually
engaged
in
interstate
commerce.
so
the
person
could
be
a
railroad
employee
and
if
his
activities
at
the
time
of
his
injury
were
intrastate
activities
then
he
was
not
entitled
to
the
benefits
of
the
federal
employer's
liability
act.
so
he
stood
in
the
same
posture
with
respect
to
his
claim
that
the
ordinary
individual
who
was
not
a
railroad
employee
he
was.
we
had
a
series
of
cases
that
articulated
the
import
of
the
schlemmer
case,
applied
that
rule,
carried
it
on
and
held
that
insofar
as
the
federal
safety
appliance
act
was
concerned,
of
course
a
federal
question
was
presented
as
to
what
its
proper
construction
was.
what
they
said
that
an
injured
party
who
was
not
entitled
to
the
benefits
of
the
federal
employers
liability
act
did
not
have
a
federally
created
cause
of
action.
that
this
duty
to
have
cars
equipped
with
those
appliances
which
were
in
conformity
with
the
safety
appliance
act
was
an
absolute
duty.
the
only
effect
of
the
federal
safety
appliance
act
was
to
substitute
a
strict
and
absolute
obligations
specified
by
statute
in
lieu
of
the
ordinary
common
law
obligation
to
maintain
your
cars
in
a
reasonably
safe
condition.
now
true
and
from
the
very
beginning,
this
court
has
held
that
that
is
a
absolute
requirement,
impose
an
absolute
duty
to
comply
over
those
strict
requirements
of
the
federal
safety
appliance
act
and
its
obligation
that
cannot
be
avoided
by
any
degree
of
care
no
matter
however
assiduous
as
justice
hughes,
the
chief
justice
hughes
said
in
the
brady
case.
so
we
come
into
a
situation
here
when
we
start
out
any
person
injured
as
a
result
of
a
defective
federal
appliance,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
who
that
person
is,
is
entitled
to
the
benefits
of
that
federal
safety
appliance
act.
he
may
be
a
person
approaching
the
railroad,
crossing
it,
may
be
a
man
climbing
on
a
car,
any
person
as
you
very,
very
distinctly
said
who
needs
the
protection
of
that
federal
safety
appliance
act
is
entitled
to
it.
and
that
duty
is
an
absolute
duty
in
one
that
can
result
in
a
situation
where
a
person
injured
can
impose
liability
upon
a
railroad
without
fault,
and
you
can
have
a
situation
here
where
you,
as
we
say
under
the
facts
of
this
very
case.
if
liability
were
to
be
imposed
here,
it
would
be
without
fault
on
that
part
of
the
cedar
rapids
and
iowa
city
railroad
because
at
that
the
time
these
cars
were
delivered,
they
were
firmly
coupled
together
at
the
time
they
were
uncoupled
by
these
men
who
were
employees
of
cargill
for
the
purpose
of
weighing.
the
couplers
were
functioning
in
perfect
order.
it
was
no
dispute
but
what
these
cars
at
the
time
they
were
delivered
were
in
absolute
perfect
condition.
now,
we
have
a
situation
here
where
this
case
was
brought
as
it
could
be
in
three
counts.
one,
ordinary
common
law
negligence
for
delivering
a
car
that
was
not
equipped
with
proper
couplers.
two,
failure
to
deliver
the
car
that
was
in
conformity
with
the
federal
safety
appliance
act.
three,
res
ipsa
loquitur.
at
the
conclusion
of
plaintiff's
case,
the
court
directed
a
verdict
against
the
plaintiff
on
all
claims
that
were
based
on
common
law
negligence
because
viewing
the
evidence
from
the
like
most
(inaudible)
the
plaintiff.
the
jury
were
to
found
that
there
had
been
any
negligence
on
the
part
of
the
railroad
company
in
delivering
those
cars,
that
verdict
would
not
have
had
any
support
in
the
evidence.
so
the
case
proceeded
to
trial
on
this
single
count
before
the
jury.
now
in
connection
with
the
situation
as
it
presented,
there
it
was
urged
throughout
the
trial,
that
contributory
negligence
was
not
a
defense.
and
when
the
district
court
or
the
trial
court
held
that
it
--
contributory
negligence
was
available
as
a
defense
then
the
petitioner
requested
a
so-called
emergency
instruction
which
told
the
jury
that
they
found
that
the
plaintiff
was
confronted
with
a
sudden
emergency
so
that
he
was
required
to
act
under
circumstances,
or
he
didn't
have
time
for
adequate
deliberation
then
he
would
not
be
held
to
that
degree
of
care
that
a
person
would
be
who
was
not
confronted
with
such
an
emergency,
but
he
would
only
be
required
to
use
that
care
for
his
own
safety.
that
a
reasonably
prudent
person
would
be
required
to
use
under
the
same
or
similar
circumstance,
so
we
have
a
fair,
fair
submission,
it's
not
any
lopsided
submission
at
all.
the
iowa
court
said
that
the
instructions
with
respect
to
contributory
negligence
were
in
full
conformity
with
the
iowa
law.
now
you're
not
going
to
find
that
instruction
in
there
your
honor.
you'll
find
it
set
out
in
my
--
in
our
brief
in
the
statement
of
facts
certainly,
and
they
did
not
set
it
out
here
and
i'm
reading
it.
i
set
it
out
here
on
page
4
of
the
brief
for
respondent,
this
is
the
instruction
that
they
requested
and
this
is
what
was
given.
when
one
is
confronted
with
a
sudden
emergency
not
brought
about
by
his
own
fault
and
because
the
railroad
is
required
to
act
upon
the
impulse
of
the
moment
without
sufficient
time
to
determine
with
certainty
the
best
course
to
pursue
is
not
held
to
the
same
accuracy
of
judgment
as
would
be
required
of
him
who
had
time
for
deliberation.
under
such
circumstances,
he
was
required
to
act
only
as
an
ordinarily
careful
and
prudent
person
would
act
when
suddenly
placed
in
the
similar
position,
and
he'd
be
so
acts
he
is
not
liable
for
injury
or
damage
resulting
from
his
conduct.
mr.
william
m.
dallas
that's
right
your
honor,
that's
in
accordance
with
the
iowa
law
and
the
iowa
supreme
court
said
that
was
a
correct
statement
of
the
iowa
law
in
contributory
negligence.
mr.
william
m.
dallas
that's
right,
that's
right.
now
that
gets
to
the
very
pith
of
our
problem.
if
you
were
to
say
that
you
had
a
federally
created
cause
of
action
here,
then
you'd
have
a
situation
where
you
could
not
deviate
from
those
federal
rules
and
that's
where
you
get
into
these
lines
of
cases.
some
of
them
you
have
here
where
the
action
was
brought
under
the
federal
safety
appliance
act,
and
then
the
court
endeavored
to
inject
into
that
case.
some
local
rule
that
was
common
to
the
local
jurisdiction.
mr.
william
m.
dallas
that's
right,
excuse
me.
mr.
william
m.
dallas
that's
right,
i
--
excuse
me
for
correcting
my
misapplication
of
the
word.
now
urging,
you
have
those
situations
then.
you
have
no
right
of
course
to
inject
some
local
rule
that
may
result
in
a
lack
of
uniformity
in
the
procedure.
but
here
the
court
has
always
held
that
you
have
no
federally
created
cause
of
action
here.
and
as
the
cases
have
said
so
frequently,
the
breach
of
this
duty,
the
violation
of
the
federal
safety
appliance
act,
merely
gives
rise
to
a
situation
where
an
injured
person
must
look
to
the
applicable
state
law
for
the
remedy
to
recover
damages
for
that
breach.
and
that
is
precisely
what
the
iowa
court
said
in
applying
these
earlier
cases
and
said
that
there's
been
--
those
cases
had
never
been
overruled.
now
just
one
--
mr.
william
m.
dallas
before
the
luncheon
i
had
mentioned
these
previous
cases
that
had
been
decided
by
this
court
in
the
construction
which
this
court
had
given
to
the
federal
safety
appliance
act.
and
i
feel
that
a
reading
of
those
cases
does
not
permit
any
other
conclusion
other
than
the
fact
that
in
the
instances
where
a
person
who
is
injured
has
the
right
to
the
benefits
of
the
federal
employer's
liability
act
that
the
--
all
the
common
law
defenses
are
available.
now
that
is
the
situation
that
there
can
be
no
escape
from
that
conclusion.
now
true,
you
have
a
situation
here
where
this
court
is
the
final
(inaudible),
what
the
federal
employer's
liability
act
should
--
ought
--
should
be
properly
construe.
but
we
say
that
--
mr.
william
m.
dallas
federal
safety
appliance
act,
excuse
me
your
honor,
i'm
--
if
it
wasn't
for
you
gentlemen
keeping
me
in
line
here,
i
had
to
be
making
some
serious
mr.
william
m.
dallas
--
mistakes.
mr.
william
m.
dallas
that's
right.
i
know,
--
(inaudible)
any
confusion.
in
other
words,
that
brings
us
down
to
three
of
the
more
recent
cases,
the
o'donnell
case,
the
carter
case
and
the
affolder
case.
they
were
all
automatic
coupler
cases
that
were
decided
within
a
period
of
very
few
months
of
each
other.
those
were
all
instances
where
the
court
had
an
instance
of
injury
to
a
railroad
employee.
his
action
was
brought
under
the
employer's
liability
act.
and
in
those
cases
the
court
made
pronouncements
as
to
the
fact
that
negligence
on
the
part
of
the
railroad.
the
failure
to
comply
with
the
requirements
of
the
federal
safety
appliance
act
those
requirements,
were
absolute,
and
negligence
was
not
an
issue
with
respect
to
such
compliance.
now
there
isn't
any
--
the
cases
in
mr.
justice
jackson
when
he
wrote
the
opinion
in
the
o'donnell
case,
cited
cases
that
were
decided
long
prior
to
the
cases
to
which
i
have
made
reference
here.
insofar
of
his
conclusion
that
negligence
was
not
an
issue
or
any
legal
excuse
would
not
be
available
to
a
defense
as
--
a
defense
to
a
railroad,
like
you
would
have
in
the
ordinary
state
statute
where
you
have
a
violation,
a
technical
violation.
but
if
the
party
was
able
to
show
that
he'd
used
every
precaution
that
was
humanly
possible
to
avoid
a
violation,
why
then,
it
would
be
up
to
the
jury
to
say,
?well,
he
has
a
legal
excuse
if
he
finds
that
he
did
everything
reasonably
possible
to
avoid
compliance.?
but
that
defense
is
not
available
to
a
violation
of
the
federal
safety
appliance
act.
and
that
--
mr.
william
m.
dallas
he
doesn't
have
to
prove
negligence
at
all
and
he
didn't
have
--
mr.
william
m.
dallas
well,
because
the
federal
statute,
perhaps
the
best
illustration
that
i
can
give
--
mr.
william
m.
dallas
in
other
words
if
the
--
mr.
william
m.
dallas
your
honor
i
like
that
you
--
mr.
william
m.
dallas
i
think
you've
pointed
up
before
our
line
of
demarcation
is.
a
violation
of
the
federal
statute
constitutes
a
violation
of
an
absolute
duty,
and
we
cannot
escape
the
conformity
without
duty
by
showing
any
degree
of
care.
but
that's
only
one
of
the
ingredients
of
a
cause
of
action.
in
other
words
looking
to
the
federal
safety
appliance
act
alone
it
doesn't
create
any
cause
of
action,
that's
what
it's
been
so
many
times
held.
in
other
words
as
justice
clark
said
in
the
affolder
case,
it
--
mr.
william
m.
dallas
he
sues
on
a
violation
of
the
federal
safety
appliance
act
as
creating
the
wrong
or
the
breach
of
duty
that
--
as
owed
to
him.
mr.
william
m.
dallas
not
a
cause,
not
a
complete,
not
a
cause
of
action
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
william
m.
dallas
no
but
he
must
look
to
the
state
law
for
causation,
for
proximate
cause
and
the
other
elements
that
--
mr.
william
m.
dallas
yes
to
look
to
--
that's
right,
that's
what
you
said
many
times.
mr.
william
m.
dallas
well,
in
other
words
he
must
look
to
those
requirements
of
the
state
law
for
what
is
an
actionable
wrong.
in
other
words,
the
wrong,
the
breach
of
duty
occurred
but
--
mr.
william
m.
dallas
but
the
state
is
not
permitted
to
say
that
your
honor,
your
federal
--
mr.
william
m.
dallas
well,
because
the
violation
of
the
safety
appliance
act
--
mr.
william
m.
dallas
--
does
not
--
mr.
william
m.
dallas
--
does
not
mean
a
cause
of
action.
mr.
william
m.
dallas
that's
--
in
other
words,
the
safety
appliance
act
is
just
a
criminal
statute
that's
all
it
amounted
to.
and
the
court
has
given
it
a
construction
that
says
that
that
is
composed
the
absolute
duties
to
comply,
and
as
justice
sullivan
--
mr.
william
m.
dallas
well
in
other
words
i
don't
say
--
mr.
william
m.
dallas
well
no,
and
that's
where
we
get
into
this
confusion
when
we
talk
about
absolute
liability
and
absolute
duty,
and
that's
where
i
think
we
get
into
the
problems
and
i'm
going
to
avert
to
that
aspect
of
the
case
in
a
moment.
but
here,
to
put
it
this
way,
the
--
in
the
fairport
case,
which
is
the
first
case
that
where
a
person
approached
a
railroad
crossing
and
he
was
struck
by
train
that
didn't
have
the
proper
power
brakes
as
required
by
section
1
of
the
federal
safety
appliance
act.
then
the
question
got
into
the
case
as
to
whether
contributory
negligence
of
this
person
approaching
the
railroad
crossing
would
be
a
defense,
or
more
properly
speaking,
in
that
case
whether
last
search
chance
was
available
to
avoid
the
consequences
of
failure
to
use
proper
precautions
when
approaching
the
crossing.
and
this
is
what
justice
sullivan
in
that
fairport
case,
he
said,
"the
effect
of
the
federal
safety
appliance
act
is
to
transform
a
common
law
duty
to
use
ordinary
care
into
an
absolute
duty
which
is
imposed
by
statute"
and
that
absolute
duty
cannot
be
escaped
by
a
showing
of
care
on
the
part
of
the
railroad,
but
that's
only
in
one
side
of
the
aspect,
he
has
to
look
further
to
the
state
law
to
--
the
right
as
they
say
springs
from
the
state
law
to
recover.
so
they
must
look
to
the
state
law
to
see
whether
the
state
law
permits
or
whether
he's
got
approximate
causation
or
whether
he
has
--
mr.
william
m.
dallas
that's
right,
in
other
words,
and
that's
why
they're
endeavoring
to
say
your
honor
that
your
earlier
cases
had
held
that
there's
nothing
in
the
federal
safety
appliance
act
which
took
away
the
defense
of
contributory
negligence.
that's
the
exact
language
of
the
schlemmer
case
and
in
the
absence
of
something
taking
it
away
why
it
continues
to
exist.
now
that's
--
and
that
is
where
you're
asked
to
depart
from
those
earlier
cases,
and
now
take
on
the
different
view
on
the
theory
that
there's
been
a
change
of
philosophy
with
respect
to
that
and
that's
what
i
want
to
get
into
a
minute
here.
mr.
william
m.
dallas
yes
sir
your
honor.
mr.
william
m.
dallas
well,
there's
--
a
number
of
those
cases
your
honor
where
they've
said
that
they
would
constitute
--
i
assume
that
you'd
not
have
any
elements
of
contributory
negligence
or
with
those
other
--
mr.
william
m.
dallas
well,
in
other
words
--
i'm
not
--
mr.
william
m.
dallas
what
i
am
endeavoring
to
say
is
this,
that
the
way
the
statute
has
been
construed
up
to
now,
they've
said
that
it
did
not
provide
a
complete
cause
of
action
and
you
had
to
look
beyond
the
safety
appliance
act
for
certain
other
elements
that
were
essential
to
a
complete
cause
of
action.
and
in
the
case
of
the
injured
employee,
he
looked
to
the
federal
employer's
liability
act,
and
as
you
said
in
the
carter
case,
the
wrong
that
resulted
from
a
violation
of
a
safety
appliance
act
provided
the
element
that
gave
him
the
cause
of
action
under
the
federal
employer's
liability
act.
now
we
have
no
counter
part
of
that
unless
you're
going
to
say
that
all
people
whether
they
be
employees
or
not
should
be
treated
on
a
same
basis.
mr.
william
m.
dallas
no
that's
not
--
that's
not
your
honor,
in
other
words,
in
fact
i
realized
your
--
the
--
that's
been
quite
the
contrary
you're
holding
here
in
your
view
at
coray
versus
southern
pacific
railroad
case.
you
held
that
quite
to
the
contrary
and
that
case
that
that
--
mr.
william
m.
dallas
well,
you
spoke
for
the
court
but
--
(inaudible).
and
you
have
said
that
that
federal
safety
appliance
act
provided
a
--
or
protection
to
whoever
got
hurt
as
a
result
of
it
and
that's
been
the
whole
import
of
the
federal
safety
appliance
act.
it
was
not
a
statue
that
was
enacted
for
the
benefit
of
any
railroad
employees
alone
or
any
particular
person
who
might
be
doing
any
particular
thing
if
the
time
he
was
injured.
in
other
words
it
was
a
broad
thing
to
protect
the
public
generally
against
injuries
as
you
--
as
the
court
said
in
that
case
from
any
defective
appliance
that
was
used
and
then
--
so
then
we
start
out
here
that
every
member
of
the
public,
it's
not
a
statute
of
the
type
that
you
have
--
not
a
case
in
where
you
have
a
statute
enacted
for
the
benefit
of
minors,
for
example.
and
you
--
now
you
say
well
you
can't
plead
contributory
negligence
in
that
because
that
--
this
is
a
statute,
as
they
say
it's
enacted
for
the
benefit
of
those
people
who
aren't
able
to
protect
themselves,
that's
the
general
type.
now
this
statute
has
never
been
protected
--
has
never
been
construed
in
that
aspect
at
all,
so
that
you
have
a
situation
where
you
must
look
further.
now,
i
see
my
time
is
fast
passing,
i
want
to
just
say
a
word
for
concluding
about
the
shields
case
here,
which
is
the
case
to
which
mr.
prettyman
has
referred.
now
that's
a
case
and
i
have
read
with
very
great
interest.
the
official
transcript
in
that
case
which
sets
out
all
the
instructions
of
the
trial
court
and
so
forth,
and
i
think
that
if
you
follow
that
case
down
you'll
find
everything
that
he
says
is
true
with
respect
to
it,
except
there
was
no
instruction
given
in
that
case
by
the
trial
court
either
oral
or
written,
at
least
it's
not
set
out
in
the
record.
with
respect
to
the
question
of
the
plaintiff's
contributory
negligence
and
they
tried
this
case
both
on
two
counts,
one
on
common
law
negligence
and
the
other
on
the
violation
of
the
federal
safety
appliance
act.
and
there
was
no
instruction
on
either,
and
the
reason,
it's
rather
obvious
because
the
railroad
was
endeavoring
to
make
a
defense
in
that
case
on
the
theory
that
the
defect
on
that
so-called
running
board
had
been
painted
over
so
that
their
inspector
as
well
as
the
plaintiff
couldn't
determine
whether
there
was
any
defect
on
it.
therefore,
they
were
trying
to
make
a
defense
on
the
theory
that
they
couldn't
know
about
it
and
the
plaintiff
couldn't
either.
and
so
the
case
went
to
the
jury
and
the
jury
returned
the
verdict
for
the
plaintiff
on
both
counts,
and
then
when
it
got
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
you'll
notice
on
the
fifth
circuit
they
discussed
only
the
question
and
they
defeated
the
plaintiff
solely
on
the
grounds
that
this
so-called
running
board
was
not
a
safety
appliance
within
the
meaning
of
the
federal
safety
appliance
act.
and
they
dismissed
his
case
then
it
came
here
on
--
to
review
in
the
single
question
for
decision
here
was
whether
this
so-called
dome
step
or
running
board
was
a
safety
appliance
within
the
meaning
of
the
act.
that
caused
the
further
problem
as
to
whether
he
had
to
be
a
member
of
the
general
public
or
would
he
have
to
be
a
railroad
employee
to
claim
the
benefits
of
the
act.
and
the
court
said
that
this
was
a
safety
appliance
that
ended
that.
then
the
next
they
said,
well,
he
was
a
member
who
was
entitled
to
the
protection
of
the
act.
and
that
is
here
where
we
get
the
language
that's
been
the
subject
matter
of
our
haggling,
therefore
the
liability
is
absolute.
now
there
wasn't
any
intention
we
say
in
that
case
to
reverse
these
earlier
cases
at
all.
in
fact
the
court
as
one
of
the
cases
cited
is
the
fairport
case
which
very
definitely
and
specifically
held
that
last
clear
chance
was
available
as
a
--
it
was
a
local
problem,
it
didn't
present
a
federal
question
at
all.
therefore
you
have
a
situation
where
we
say
that
that
case
is
not
--
there
was
no
issue
of
contributory
negligence
in
that
case
at
all
when
it
reached
this
court.
and
there
wasn't
any
in
it
--
on
it
--
reached
the
fifth
circuit,
because
when
you
read
over
the
instructions,
you'll
find
that
the
court
never
gave
an
instruction
on
contributory
negligence.
true
as
mr.
prettyman
says,
the
railroad
accepted
to
the
court
in
instructing
the
--
or
that
the
contributory
negligence
would
not
constitute
a
defense,
but
there
wasn't
any
such
instruction
given
there,
if
it
wasn't,
never
got
into
the
printed
record.
so
your
honors,
we
submit
that
the
iowa
court
was
correct
in
the
concluding
that
contributory
negligence
was
available
on
the
defense
through
an
action
by
a
non-railroad
employee
and
that
these
cases
were
correctly
decided,
and
that
there's
been
no
reason
why
the
rule
should
not
be
followed
as
it
was
before.
and
to
ask
the
court
to
remedy
a
situation
now
that
has
existed
for
60
years,
we
say
is
a
matter
for
congress
rather
than
for
the
court.
