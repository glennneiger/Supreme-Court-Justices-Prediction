(inaudible)
federal
safety
appliance
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
could
you
--
let
me
ask
you,
a
non-railroad
employee
sues
in
a
state
court
over
an
automatic
coupler,
and
he
claims
a
violation
of
the
safety
appliance
act
and
the
defendant
says,
"well,
that's
true"
the
--
there
was
a
defect
here
but
it
wasn't
a
negligent
defect.
and
the
state
then
before
you
can
have
a
cause
of
action
under
state
law,
you
have
to
prove
negligence.
now
do
you
say
that
the
plaintiff
would
be
--
wouldn't
have
to
prove
negligence?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
why
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you'd
--
the
short
answer
is
the
federal
law
controls?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
federal
law
means
absolute
liability
and
the
federal
law
preempts
state
law
in
the
state
cause
of
action.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
what
is
the
cause
of
action
that
a
plaintiff
asserts
when
he
sues
in
the
state
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it
isn't
a
cause
of
action
for
negligence?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it
isn't
the
cause
of
action
the
state
law
gives
him
either,
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
just
has
to
look
to
state
law
for
a
remedy.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean
just
as
a
forum.
just
as
a
forum?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
the
state
law
says
there
isn't
any
actionable
wrong
unless
there's
negligence?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
am.
well,
then
why
is
it
permitted
to
say
that
contributory
negligence
bars?
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
only
because
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
it's
only
because
--
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
only
because
of
the
construction
of
the
safety
appliance
act
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
isn't
much
of
an
absolute
duty
is
it,
if
it
can
be
avoided
by
showing
contributory
negligence
or
just
by
showing
negligence,
not
contributory,
at
least
just
negligence?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
the
employee's
negligent,
the
absolute
liability
goes
out
the
window?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
you
also
have
to
look
to
federal
law
to
see
whether
or
not
the
safety
appliance
act
itself
bars
the
defense
of
contributory
negligence
just
like
it
bars,
or
just
like
it
precludes
the
state
conditioning
recovery
on
negligence.
justice
byron
r.
white
just
bringing
it
to
federal
court
without
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
there's
a
cause
of
action
under
federal
law.
justice
byron

(inaudible)
justice
byron

white
well,
it
has
said

it
has
said
before
(inaudible)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
it
really
has
said
before
what
--
it
already
answered
that
question
before.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
so
it's
answered
against
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
think
we
have
to
overrule
any
cases?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
court
has
already
construed
the
safety
appliance
act
as
not,
as
not
preventing
or
as
not
eliminating
contributory
negligence
as
a
defense.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
has
already
done
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
has
there
been
any
attempts
to
amend
the
safety
appliance
act
if
you
eliminate
contributory
negligence?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
you
haven't
got
any
cases
where
contributory
negligence
was
offered
as
a
defense
and
the
defense
has
been
stricken
in
the
name
of
the
safety
appliance
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
i'm
not
--
didn't
--
i
hadn't
asked
about
that,
because
it's
assumption
of
risk,
it
was
eliminated
by
the
safety
appliance
act.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
anyway,
you
haven't
any
cases
on
contributory
negligence
where
the

was
stricken
in
the

of
safety
appliance
act?
