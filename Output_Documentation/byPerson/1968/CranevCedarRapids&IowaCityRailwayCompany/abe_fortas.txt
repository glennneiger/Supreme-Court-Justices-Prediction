justice
abe
fortas
well
let's
see,
mr.
prettyman,
this
action
was
not
brought
under
the
federal
employer's
liability
act.
justice
abe
fortas
it
was
brought
only
under
the
federal
safety
appliance
act.
justice
abe
fortas
but
your
--
so
that
we
--
i
suppose
we
don't
have
before
us
a
question
whether
mr.
crane
could
be
considered
as
if
he
were
an
employee
under
the
federal
employer's
liability
act.
i
remember
vaguely
that
in
some
of
the
maritime
tort
cases,
there
are
maybe
one
or
two
decisions
in
which
somebody
not
an
employee
conventionally
considered
was
held
to
be
doing
--
performing
the
duties
of
an
employee,
and
therefore
to
come
within
relevant
laws,
but
to
that
we
can't
do
here.
that's
not
involved
here
because
you
didn't
bring
the
action
under
the
federal
employer's
liability
act.
so
what
you're
asking
us
to
do
is
specifically
and
it
is
perhaps
solely
to
read
the
federal
safety
appliance
act
as
if
it
contained
the
contributory
negligence
in
this
and
absolute
liability
provisions,
whatever
they
may
be,
of
the
federal
employee's
liability
--
federal
employer's
liability
act,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
what
construct?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
more
than
you
think
is
necessary
or
not,
you
didn't
--
the
suit
was
not
brought
under
the
federal
employer's
liability
act.
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that,
so
that's
--
so
that
possibility
would
be
out
any
way.
justice
abe
fortas
alright
now,
am
i
right
in
saying
that
what
you're
asking
us
to
do
is
to
read
the
federal
safety
appliance
act
as
if
it
contained
the
contributory
language,
negligence
language
of
fela
in
the
goss
that
has
accumulated
with
respect
to
fela?
justice
abe
fortas
well
it's
not
inconceivable
to
me
that
congress
might
establish
one
set
of
rules
as
to
negligence
for
employees
and
another
for
nonemployees?
justice
abe
fortas
but
they
did
--
didn't
the
trial
court
give
the
instruction
with
respect
to
burden
of
proof,
(voice
overlap)?
justice
abe
fortas
and
your
position
is
that
action
brought
under
the
safety
appliance
act
does
not
carry
with
it
an
overriding
of
the
state
statute
--
of
state
rule
as
to
contributory
negligence?
