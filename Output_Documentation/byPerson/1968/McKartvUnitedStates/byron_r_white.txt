justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
the
appellate
process
within
the
system?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
judicial
decisions
include
findings
of
fact.
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
a
judicial
function,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
makes
these
boards
--
the
presidential
boards
for
example
different
from
them
from
an
ordinary
administrative
agency?
i
suppose
in
ordinary
administrative
agency
you
would
say
that
the
agency
might,
should
have
first
shot
at
the
--
even
a
pure
question
of
interpretation
of
the
statute.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
--
what
would
you
say
if
the
statute
said
expressly
that
before
one
may
raise
a
matter
in
a
criminal
case,
he
has
to
exhaust
that
his
appellate
remedy
is
within
the
selective
service
system?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
making
a
constitutional
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
the
statutory
construction
aren't
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
you're
making
a
statutory
construction
argument
that
the
statute
does
not
require
exhaustion?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
think
the
court
was
doing
in
falbo
just
saying
you
have
to
exhaust
or
the
statute
required
you
to
exhaust?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
this
was
just
a
judicial
imposed
the
exhaustion
doctrine
or
was
it
a
statutory
construction
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
mean
you
don't
think
the
court
was
saying
that
congress
intended
the
registrant
first
to
exhaust
his
remedies
and
--
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
mean
what
was
thought
to
be
the
statutory?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
mean
the
law
just
doesn't
require
lawyers
on
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
is
the
statutory
required
additionally?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
isn't
the
question
of
first
impression
with
respect
to
other
administrative
agencies
i
gather?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
may
be
a
question
of
first
impression
vis-à-vis
the
selective
service
system?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
certainly
another
context
is
the
usual
rule
that
the
administrative
agency
view
should
be
obtained?
justice
byron
r.
white
didn't
falbo
proceed
on
the
assumption
or
this
is
what
congress
intended
by
saying
by
providing
some
finality
to
selective
service
decisions
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
at
least
congress
intended
to
require
exhaustion?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
section
was
that,
is
that
11?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
isn't
there
--
is
there
some
specific
provision
in
the
act
that
says
which
you
refer
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
to
finality?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
beytagh,
the
--
in
falbo
and
estep
they
were
dealing
with
a
section
of
the
statute
which
is
quoted
in
estep
10
(a)
(2)
which
says
that
decisions
of
local
boards
would
be
final
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
except
where
an
appeal
is
authorized
in
accordance
with
such
rules
and
regulations
are
presently
prescribed
and
would
you
say
that
estep
and
falbo
really
construe
this
language
to
mean
that
the
very
least
before
you
get
judicial
review
you
should
exhaust
these
appellate
procedures
that
are
prescribed
by
the
president?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
that
section
still
on
the
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
remains
unchanged?
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
part
of
a
long
provision
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
10
(b)
(2).
justice
byron
r.
white
but
still
those
--
that
language
is
still
in
the
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
this
language
is
left
identical.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
assume
that
his
mother
was
still
alive
but
he
didn't
just
do
anything
didn't
even
inadvertently
inform
his
local
board
that
his
father
have
been
killed
and
there
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
here
if
and
if
he
refused
to
not
gotten
so
far
as
mr.
pickens
or
mr.
cox
which
are
alleged
but
had
simply
refused
to
be
inducted
and
refuse
to
induction
order
and
then
for
criminally
prosecuted
is
your
client
was
and
then
it
said,
well,
look
i'm
a
sole
surviving
son
and
the
government
would
respond
him
what
you
didn't
pursue
any
administrative
remedies.
now,
what
are
the
story
been
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
isn't
this
pretty
close
to
that
kind
of
case
in
light
of
my
brother
harlan's
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
the
appellate
process
within
the
system?
justice
byron

yes.

white
are
you
making
a

argument?
justice
byron

white
do
you
think
the
statutory
construction
aren't
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
you're
making
a
statutory
construction
argument
that
the
statute
does
not
require
exhaustion?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
think
the
court
was
doing
in
falbo
just
saying
you
have
to
exhaust
or
the
statute
required
you
to
exhaust?
justice
byron

white
do
you
think
this
was
just
a
judicial
imposed
the
exhaustion
doctrine
or
was
it
a
statutory
construction
case?
justice

do
you
mean
you
don't
think
the

was
saying
that
congress
intended
the

to
exhaust
his
remedies
and
--
justice
byron

white
do
you
mean
what
was
thought
to
be
the
statutory?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
mean
the
law
just
doesn't
require
lawyers
on
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
is
the
statutory
required
additionally?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
isn't
the
question
of
first
impression
with

to
other

at
