mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
outset,
petitioner's
argument
strikes
us
as
a
somewhat
curious
one
because
he
wants
us
to
assume
as
i
understand
it
that
a
question
of
statutory
construction
either
has
been
or
will
be
or
should
be
necessarily
decided
in
his
favor
and
then
he
builds
upon
that
assumption.
i
should
state
that
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
footnote
10
of
the
government's
brief,
it
was
not
out
intention
to
concede
as
petitioner
suggested
anything
regarding
the
construction
of
the
sole
surviving
son
exemption
rather
as
we
pointed
out
neither
the
courts
below
reached
this
issue
and
it
seems
to
us
that
in
light
of
that
fact
and
in
light
of
the
fact
that
it
is
a
question
of
first
impression
on
which
no
other
court
has
passed
that
it's
not
an
appropriate
issue
that
petitioner
can
ascertain
raise
here.
both
of
the
courts
below
as
petitioner
has
noted
found
it
unnecessary
to
reach
that
issue
because
they
decided
the
case
on
exhaustion
question.
i
think
that
it's
apparent
despite
petitioner's
strenuous
efforts
to
avoid
it
that
what
he
really
seeks
here
is
an
overruling
of
falbo.
he
says
that's
not
what
he
wants
that
he
has
points
in
his
case
that
are
distinguishable
from
the
situation
involved
in
falbo
and
estep
and
that
therefore
the
court
doesn't
have
to
reach
the
question
of
whether
the
falbo
doctrine
is
still
good
law.
well,
it
seems
does
that
at
the
outset
that
the
grounds
of
petitioner
seeks
as
making
his
case
a
peculiar
or
unique
one
or
readily
answer,
these
grounds
as
we
understand
it
are
two.
one
is
that
the
question
involved
here
as
a
matter
of
law
or
statutory
interpretation
and
that
the
agencies
of
the
selective
service
system
as
i
take
it
from
the
local
board
through
the
state
appeal
board
all
the
way
up
to
the
national
appeal
board
are
either
incompetent,
unqualified
or
for
some
other
reason
unable
to
pass
on
such
question.
well,
it
seems
to
us
this
is
simply
not
reflective
of
the
fact.
question
was
raised
about
whether
there
are
any
lawyers
on
selective
service
appeal
boards.
the
answer
to
that
is
that
the
regulations
themselves
require
that
one
member
of
each
state
appeal
board
be
a
lawyer.
and
as
a
matter
or
fact
as
to
the
national
appeal
board,
the
chairman
himself
is
a
lawyer.
he's
a
probate
judge.
moreover,
it's
a
little
bit
difficult
to
understand
how
you
can
say
that
certain
issues
are
simply
matters
of
the
law.
every
question
of
classification
involves
questions
of
law
what
the
boards
are
seeking
to
do
is
to
pursuant
to
the
regulations
in
the
statute
as
they
interpret
and
construe
them,
give
each
registrant
the
appropriate
classifications
that
congress
has
determined
that
he
should
have.
they
worked
against
the
background
and
in
the
framework
of
the
selective
service
act
in
the
pertinent
regulations.
there's
no
other
way
that
they
can
operate.
insofar
as
the
statute
itself
is
concern,
it
is
silent
on
this
subject.
it
says
that
local
boards
shall
have
the
power
with
their
respect
to
jurisdictions
to
hear
and
determine
subject
to
the
right
of
appeal
to
the
appeal
boards
here
unauthorized
all
questions
or
claims
with
respect
to
the
inclusion
for
or
exemption
or
deferment
from
training
and
service
of
all
individuals
within
the
jurisdiction
of
these
boards
and
the
similar
provisions
that
relate
to
the
de
novo
a
classification
by
the
appeal
board
and
the
national
board.
so,
it
seems
to
us
that
for
several
reasons
petitioner
is
not
on
sound
ground
when
he
suggests
that
matters
of
law
are
wholly
without
the
competence
of
these
boards.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
this
court
in
cox
versus
united
states
in
332
u.s.
noted
that
questions
of
classification
are
matters
of
the
law
for
the
courts
decide
not
for
the
jury.
it
seems
to
us
that
it's
logical
to
conclude
from
that
that
when
these
local
boards
and
state
appeal
board,
the
national
board
of
passing
on
these
questions
that
necessarily
they're
involved
in
legal
issues.
i
realize
that
there's
a
continuum
that
exists
here.
some
questions
are
more
peculiarly
factual
in
nature
and
some
questions
more
appropriately
legal
in
nature.
now,
what
i'm
seeking
to
point
out
is
that
as
a
local
board
faces
a
question
of
classification
it
has
to
face
that
issue
against
the
backdrop
of
the
selective
service
act
in
a
pertinent
regulations.
those
are
laws
insofar
as
i
know
and
can
determine.
and
therefore
to
say
that
they
can't
--
that
they
had
no
confidence
to
pass
on
these
matters,
it
seems
to
me
is
simply
wrong.
petitioner
also
suggest
that
--
well,
on
that
point
as
was
noted
by
mr.
justice
white
in
conclusion
on
that
point
of
passing
on
statutory
--
question
of
statutory
interpretation
or
law,
it
does
seem
to
us
that
it's
not
an
appropriate
here
to
give
the
administrative
agency
charged
with
the
administration
of
this
act.
a
first
opportunity
to
pass
on
an
important
statutory
question,
petitioner
can
see
as
this
question
is
one
of
first
impression,
the
act
was
amended
in
1964
as
a
great
dearth
of
authority
on
the
whole
meaning
of
the
sole
surviving
son
exemption.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i'm
unclear
what
you
mean
by
that?
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
that's
what
i'm
suggesting
should
obtain
here.
yes,
your
honor.
and
what
the
question
of
first
impression
that
i
refer
to
is
the
statutory
question
of
the
proper
construction
of
the
sole
surviving
son
exemption
which
for
the
first
time
in
1964
included
the
reference
to
fathers
which
it
had
not
concluded
before.
we
--
in
order
we
see
anything
in
the
cases
that
indicates
any
distinction
in
this
regard
and
we
submit
that
therefore
it's
not
inappropriate
that
the
falbo
doctrine
be
construed
to
require
that
on
all
matters
of
classification,
the
administrative
agencies
and
the
administrative
process
be
given
an
opportunity
to
consider
these
questions
in
the
first
instance.
they
weren't
given
this
opportunity
here,
petitioner's
position
are
simply
that
he
didn't
want
anything
to
do
with
the
selective
service
system.
the
record
makes
this
clear.
he
repeatedly
said
he
just
didn't
want
everything
to
do
it
and
wrote
the
board
and
told
them
so.
he
didn't
claim
sole
surviving
son
exemption
himself.
the
board
conferred
it
upon
him
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
he
mentioned
this
your
honor
and
the
board
then
responded
and
sent
him
a
conscientious
objector
form
because
he
had
also
indicated
that
perhaps
he
had
some
reasons
for
filing
that
sort
of
claim.
he
wrote
back
and
said
no
he
didn't
and
then
wrote
back
and
also
said
that
that
he
didn't
even
know
if
he
was
a
sole
surviving
son
by
his
father
had
been
killed
at
world
war
ii.
the
board
then
proceeded
to
quite
a
further
and
obtained
information
that
confirm
the
fact
that
he
was
a
sole
surviving
son
and
his
because
his
father
had
been
killed
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
and
his
mother
was
still
then
alive.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
it's
not
wholly
clear,
it's
clear
as
i
recall
that
one
set
of
grandparents
is
alive
and
at
least
one
grandparent
on
the
other
side
is
alive.
i
have
no
knowledge
of
the
relevance
of
this
and
have
no
way
of
knowing
what
relevance
the
appeal
boards
might
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
there
is
an
information
in
the
record
there
is
a
testimony
in
this
regard
that
it
was
taken
at
trial
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
--
at
his
trial
and
it
appears
that
pages
15
and
16
of
the
appendix
of
the
testimony
was
as
i
recall
by
his
uncle
to
criminal
crime.
the
other
aspect
of
petitioner's
position
that
there's
no
need
to
reach
the
validity
of
the
falbo
doctrine
here
is
that
it
would've
been
futile
in
any
event
to
pursue
his
administrative
remedies.
well,
we
think
that
that's
simply
not
accurate
on
the
facts.
the
administrative
remedies
that
were
available
to
him
were
in
the
first
instance
an
appeal
to
the
state
appeal
board.
and
further,
from
that
decision
an
appeal
to
the
national
appeal
board
if
one,
the
state
appeal
board
had
been
divided
or
two,
even
had
it
not
been
divided.
he
could
have
asked
the
national
or
the
state
director
to
take
the
case
to
the
national
board
upon
his
behalf.
as
the
court
may
recall
this
is
a
situation
that
existed
in
clay
case
and
there
has
been
a
consistent
position
taken
by
the
national
and
state
directors
that
questions
of
importance
in
the
system
will
be
taken
to
the
national
board
on
behalf
of
registrant
even
though
they
don't
have
appeals
as
right.
it
seems
to
us
that
it
would've
been
futile
here
for
petitioner
to
seek
to
exhaust
his
administrative
remedies.
he
refers
to
the
fact
that
advice
was
given
by
the
national
director
and
the
state
director
to
his
local
board
in
response
to
an
inquiry
to
the
effect
that
the
pertinent
section
of
the
act
section
6
(o)
should
be
construed
as
not
allowing
his
statutory
exemption
under
the
circumstances.
well,
that's
true
but
it's
also
true
that
the
national
director
and
the
state
director
are
different
people
and
the
state
appeal
board
and
certainly
for
the
national
appeal
board.
it's
clear
by
statute
that
the
national
appeal
board
is
an
independent
body
responsible
only
to
the
president
and
exercising
the
powers
given
at
the
president
under
the
act
as
his
direct
delegate.
it's
not
responsible
to
the
selective
service
system
or
to
the
director
in
any
way.
the
state
appeal
board
similarly
are
not
required
to
follow
a
bulletin's
advice
whatever
given
by
the
national
director
or
the
state
director.
they
are
required
under
the
law
to
consider
de
novo
of
propriety
of
an
individual's
classification.
so,
it
seems
to
us
that
the
fact
that
in
form
of
advice
was
given
by
the
national
director
and
the
state
director
on
this
matter
is
not
convincing.
there's
one
other
aspect
that
petitioner
seeks
to
rely
upon
the
national
director
promulgated
an
operations
bulletin
in
august
of
1964
shortly
after
the
enactment
of
the
amendment
which
included
for
the
first
time
fathers
within
the
category
of
those
persons
whose
death
may
trigger
the
sole
surviving
son
exemption.
and
that
operations
bulletin
essentially
took
the
position
the
petitioner
here
argues
as
to
the
substantive
issue.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that
he
argues
on
the
substantive
issue
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
--
i.e.
that
the
basic
theory
is
one
of
preservation
of
lineage
rather
than
compassion
or
comfort
whatever.
it
seems
to
us
that
this
is
not
convincing
either.
the
very
fact
that
the
bulletin
was
withdrawn
so
promptly
indicates
there
was
considerable
uncertainty
on
the
part
of
the
national
director
and
moreover
all
of
the
considerations
that
i
mentioned
to
just
previously
regarding
the
role
--
respective
roles
of
the
national
state
directors
and
the
state
appeal
board,
the
national
appeal
board
are
applicable
here
as
well.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
failure
to
report
for
induction.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that's
correct.
the
system
was
changed
as
i
recall
late
in
world
war
ii
but
shortly
after
falbo's,
it
may
have
been
prior
to
estep.
it
became
clear
that
it
just
wasn't
workable
because
you
would
get
all
these
men
down
at
the
induction
center
and
then
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
half
of
would
be.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
so
the
system
since
that
time
with
only
minor
changes
has
been
the
one
that
they
adopted
then
of
preinduction
physical
is
roughly
60
to
90
days
prior
to
the
proposed
induction
day
and
then
if
the
man
passes
it
he's
given
an
order
to
report
for
induction
if
he
fails
because
he's
classified
for
(voice
overlap).
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that's
pursuant
to
army
regulations
not
selective
service
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
--
at
the
induction
station,
yes
your
honor.
petitioner
here
received
two
orders
to
report
for
preinduction
physical.
he
reported
for
neither
one
of
them.
we
point
out
that
one
aspect
at
least
to
the
falbo
doctrine
is
that
an
individual
potentially
subject
to
the
draft
is
required
to
appear
for
physical
examination
simply
because
the
result
of
that
examination
may
be
to
preclude
his
induction.
petitioner
by
failing
to
report,
failing
to
complete
the
administrative
processing
that
is
required,
precluded
any
possibility
of
that
aspect
to
the
falbo
doctrine
being
irrelevant
here.
we
think
then
that
petitioner's
challenge
has
to
be
to
the
falbo
doctrine
itself
and
that
doctrine
is
the
court
well
knows.
it
referred
to
that
doctrine
with
as
we
understand
apparent
approval
in
the
oestereich
case
and
mr.
justice
harlan
also
referred
to
it
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
oestereich.
falbo
and
estep
were
also
cited
in
the
recent
gabriel
decision.
that
doctrine
essentially
is
that
administrative
remedies
provided
within
the
selective
service
system
must
be
exhausted
by
a
registrant
in
order
for
him
to
be
in
a
position
to
challenge
his
classification
in
court
should
he
fails
subsequently
to
report
for
induction.
the
premise
on
which
this
doctrine
is
grounded
is
not
one
foreign
to
the
administrative
law
generally.
it
seems
to
us
that
it
has
peculiar
applicability
in
the
selective
service
context
because
the
basic
underlying
notion
of
the
selective
service
system
is
the
court
recently
in
o'brien
noted
is
the
prompt
mobilization
of
men
when
necessary
in
time
of
war
a
national
emergency
to
serve
the
country.
now,
we
recognize
that
if
falbo
was
overruled,
each
and
every
registrant
is
not
going
to
simply
defy
the
system
as
petitioner
did
here
and
wait
until
he's
prosecuted
criminally
in
order
to
raise
whatever
a
claims
he
has
as
to
the
validity
of
his
classification
but
there
will
be
some
incentive
in
that
regard
provided
and
in
a
time
of
national
emergency,
in
a
time
of
war,
it
seems
to
us
that
if
falbo
is
overruled
there's
some
real
hazards
presented
to
the
effective
operation
of
the
system.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
it's
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
it's
clear
from
a
reading
of
falbo
that
that's
exactly
what
the
court
was
doing
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
it
was
attempted
to
construe.
i
think
rather
the
over
all
act
because
that
the
reference
is
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
under
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
under
section
10
(b)
(3)
is
amended
the
congress
provided
that
such
review,
judicial
review
shall
go
to
the
question
of
the
jurisdiction
here
in
reserve
to
local
boards,
appeal
boards
and
the
president
only
when
there
is
no
basis
in
fact
for
the
classification
assigned
to
such
registrant.
now,
section
10
(b)
(3)
as
the
court
noted
in
oestereich
and
gabriel
also
contemplates
that
review
should
occur
at
that
point
in
time
in
the
process
where
it
would
be
--
would
avoid
as
far
as
possible
the
interruption
of
the
processing
of
the
system.
now,
in
oestereich,
the
court
found
that
the
congress
didn't
intend
that
the
preclusion
on
preinduction
review
be
applicable
in
all
situations.
it
said
that
where
a
specific
statutory
exemption
that
was
clear
and
unequivocal
and
undisputed
existed
that
it
read
the
act
is
not
requiring
the
registrant
to
go
through
the
entire
process
for
asserting
his
claim
and
therefore
found
that
preinduction
review
was
available.
petitioner
suggests
that
the
position
we
take
here
is
somehow
inconsistent
with
oestereich.
we
take
exception
with
that
as
i
noted
previously
the
court
did
refer
in
oestereich
with
apparent
approval
to
the
exhaustion
doctrine.
the
court
noted
that
the
outset
of
the
oestereich
opinion
that
oestereich
had
taken
his
administrative
appeals
and
lost.
petitioner
says
that
oestereich
was
not
required
to
take
a
physical.
well,
it
seems
to
us
that
when
you
have
a
situation
where
preinduction
review
is
available
somewhat
different
approach
necessarily
has
to
be
taken
as
to
what
remedies
need
be
exhausted.
oestereich
exhausted
those
remedies
that
were
relevant
to
the
question
of
whether
his
entitlement
to
the
statutory
exemption
existed
or
not.
on
the
point
that
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
that's
right.
the
exhaustion
that
we
are
referring
to
is
the
pursuit
of
administrative
remedies
prior
to
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
which
oestereich
did
do.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that's
correct.
it
seems
to
us
that
the
court
in
oestereich
was
simply
construing
the
intendment
of
congress
regarding
provisions
that
were
and
apparently
in
some
conflict.
in
gabriel,
the
court
made
clear
that
the
general
preclusion
on
preinduction
review
was
applicable
that
there
are
only
certain
exceptions
that
would
be
permitted.
we
recognized
that
there
are
certain
limited
exemptions
that
have
been
noted
over
the
years
to
the
exhaustion
doctrine.
petitioner
refers
to
a
variety
of
these
and
of
the
cases
in
which
they
have
been
considered.
and
i'd
like
just
to
refer
quickly
to
what
these
are.
one
notion
is
that
you
don't
have
to
exhaust
when
it's
simply
infeasible
or
impracticable
to
do
so.
one
individual
in
the
donato
case
was
off
on
fire
fighting
duty
during
the
period
in
time
and
which
he
had
to
take
his
administrative
appeal
and
the
court
there
said
it
should
be
excused
because
it
just
wasn't
possible
that
the
practicable
for
him
to
do
so.
another
relates
to
a
serious
procedural
irregularity
within
the
system
itself.
in
the
will's
case,
the
petitioner
refers
to
a
some
link
as
we
read
it
that's
the
basic
ground
on
which
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
it
could
excuse
exhaustion.
in
the
will's
case
and
the
notice
of
delinquency
was
not
sent
to
the
registrant
of
the
appropriate
time.
and
therefore,
he
was
in
a
disadvantage
situation
with
respect
to
his
classification
because
he
wasn't
apprise
in
the
timely
fashion
that
sort
of
procedural
or
irregularity
has
been
also
allowed
to
excuse
the
exhaustion
of
administrative
remedy.
in
the
wolf
case,
the
court
of
appeals,
the
second
circuit
discussed
at
some
length
the
falbo
doctrine,
the
exhaustion
of
remedies
doctrine
and
the
selective
service
context
found
it
inapplicable
where
first
amendment
issues
were
a
series
of
first
amendment
questions
were
involved.
that
involved
and
attempted
delinquency
reclassification
of
registrants
for
sitting
in
a
draft
board
in
arbor
michigan.
and
the
court
there
found
that
the
questions
they
raised
under
the
first
amendment
were
comprehended
under
this
court's
doctrine
of
--
in
dombrowski
versus
pfister
and
therefore
an
appropriate
exception
to
the
exhaustion
rule
could
be
permitted.
the
--
another
exception
that's
been
noted
has
to
do
with
whether
the
individual
is
aware
of
his
administrative
remedies
as
will
be
developed
at
greater
length
in
the
subsequent
case
to
burney.
the
procedure
that's
established
here
is
one
that
seeks
to
make
registrants
amply
aware
of
what
rights
they
have.
the
selective
service
classification
certificate
itself
has
we
have
reprinted
in
the
appendix
pages
62
and
63
sets
out
all
the
detail
procedures
that
need
to
be
taken
and
the
time
within
which
these
procedures
need
to
be
followed.
i
should
note
that
subsequent
to
the
operative
facts
in
this
case
the
pertinent
regulations
have
been
amended
so
that
now
the
registrant
has
30
days
instead
of
10
days
within
which
to
take
an
appeal
to
the
state
appeal
board
the
feeling
being
that
some
of
these
cases
relating
to
exceptional
circumstances
had
perhaps
resulted
because
of
the
short
period
of
time
that
had
previously
been
given.
we
make
a
separate
point
of
his
failure
to
report
for
preinduction
physicals
as
i
noted
that
is
a
precise
aspect
of
the
falbo
holding
itself.
falbo
of
course
was
clarified
and
confirmed
in
estep
those
cases
bracketed
together
stand
for
the
exhaustion
doctrine
that
we
here
rely
upon
and
the
courts
below
relied
upon
but
it
seems
to
us
that
it
is
a
somewhat
separate
in
different
thing
is
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
iron's
case
recently
noted
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief
large
numbers
of
registrants
are
unfortunately
found
not
to
be
physically
fit
when
they
take
a
physical.
had
petitioner
taken
a
physical,
we
have
no
way
of
knowing
what
is
physical
condition
is
but
he
may
well
have
been
found
not
to
be
physically
fit
and
therefore
they
would
have
been
no
occasion
to
reach
any
of
their
question
that
is
now
seeks
to
present.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes
your
honor.
the
record
clearly
reflects
that.
he
would
notify
on
each
occasion
where
to
report,
when
to
report
and
he
simply
responded
by
saying
he
didn't
want
to
have
anything
to
deal
with
the
system.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
it's
important
that
as
justice
stewart
pointed
out
subsequent
to
shortly
after
falbo
the
system
was
changed
so
that
preinduction
physicals
are
now
required.
the
purpose
of
that
is
so
that
each
board
will
know
ahead
of
time
what
individuals
it
has
available
physically
qualified
individuals
available
to
meet
each
monthly
call
as
it
occurs.
so,
it
seems
to
us
that
it
is
an
important
aspect
to
the
system
otherwise
the
board
has
no
way
of
knowing
what
this
individual's
situation
or
status
is.
and
so
therefore,
we
think
that
there's
an
independent
ground
here
as
petitioner
notes
he
wasn't
charged
with
failure
to
report
for
physical
exam.
and
we
realize
that
but
in
the
context
of
the
applicability
of
the
exhaustion
doctrine
our
point
simply
is
that
this
is
another
aspect
that
we
think
should
be
taken
into
account.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
if
petitioner
prevails
on
the
broad
ground
that
the
falbo
doctrine
should
be
overruled
and
therefore
that
exhaustion
of
administrative
remedy
is
no
longer
required.
it
seems
to
me
that
there
are
at
least
two
principal
disadvantages
that
would
result.
one,
operation
of
the
selective
service
system
itself
would
be
subject
to
serious
disruption
because
individuals
would
not
be
required
to
pursue
remedies
through
the
system
as
elaborate
machinery
that
congress
in
the
present
have
established
to
consider
and
pass
upon
claims
to
classification
would
--
could
be
deliberately
and
effectively
bypass.
indeed,
that's
what
petitioner
sought
to
do
here
we
think
simply
deliberately
bypass
this
whole
system.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
it
seems
to
us
it
could
well
create
very
serious
delays
and
disruptions
because
there
would
be
no
way
of
knowing
if
individuals
did
not
pursue
their
administrative
remedies
and
if
individuals
did
not
report
for
preinduction
physicals,
no
way
of
knowing
from
month
to
month.
those
individuals
that
were
available
that
the
system
is
set
up
not
to
put
people
in
jail
and
to
prosecute
them
but
for
violations
of
the
act
but
to
properly
classify
and
induct
them
into
the
service
and
it
seems
to
us
that
the
whole
administrative
machinery
is
directed
toward
that
purpose
insuring
a
proper
classification
and
insuring
that
there
is
a
steady
continuous
flow
of
manpower
when
needed
for
the
armed
services.
and
it
seems
to
us
that
if
the
exhaustion
doctrine
is
abandoned
that
will
be
interfered
way.
the
other
aspect
it
seems
to
us
of
this
is
simply
that
when
the
administrative
agencies
are
bypassed
the
load
of
litigation
in
the
courts
is
commensurately
will
increased
and
the
courts
are
going
to
be
forced
to
pass
on
these
questions
without
any
gloss
of
administrative
interpretation
or
construction
and
without
screening
and
reading
out
of
cases
that
would
be
taken
care
of
through
following
the
administrative
process.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
that's
essentially
what
the
court
did
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that
section
is
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
--
is
as
i
recall
that
section
is
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
--part
of
a
long
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
provision
that
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that's
correct.
it
was
of
course
amended
the
whole
long
provision
460
(b)
(3).
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor
and
the
--
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
congress
ratified
this
court's
construction
of
that
language
in
the
falbo
and
estep
cases
by
providing
that
no
basis
in
fact
standard
should
be
the
one
that's
applied
in
judicial
review
here.
that
of
course
is
the
provision
that
the
language
that
estep
adopted
in
delineating
the
stand
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well
i
would
like
to
think
that
that's
the
end
of
the
case
and
it
seem
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
as
i
understand
it
it's
not
the
end
of
the
case
because
over
the
years
certain
exceptions
have
been
carved
out
to
this
doctrine
and
petitioner
suggests
that
his
case
fits
within
some
of
this
exception.
our
position
is
twofold,
one,
these
exceptions
are
not
applicable
here
and
in
any
event
the
falbo
doctrine
should
be
upheld.thank
you.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
outset,
petitioner's
argument
strikes
us
as
a
somewhat
curious
one
because
he
wants
us
to
assume
as
i
understand
it
that
a
question
of
statutory
construction
either
has
been
or
will
be
or
should
be
necessarily
decided
in
his
favor
and
then
he
builds
upon
that
assumption.
i
should
state
that
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
footnote
10
of
the
government's
brief,
it
was
not
out
intention
to
concede
as
petitioner
suggested
anything
regarding
the
construction
of
the
sole
surviving
son
exemption
rather
as
we
pointed
out
neither
the
courts
below
reached
this
issue
and
it
seems
to
us
that
in
light
of
that
fact
and
in
light
of
the
fact
that
it
is
a
question
of
first
impression
on
which
no
other
court
has
passed
that
it's
not
an
appropriate
issue
that
petitioner
can
ascertain
raise
here.
both
of
the
courts
below
as
petitioner
has
noted
found
it
unnecessary
to
reach
that
issue
because
they
decided
the
case
on
exhaustion
question.
i
think
that
it's
apparent
despite
petitioner's
strenuous
efforts
to
avoid
it
that
what
he
really
seeks
here
is
an
overruling
of
falbo.
he
says
that's
not
what
he
wants
that
he
has
points
in
his
case
that
are
distinguishable
from
the
situation
involved
in
falbo
and
estep
and
that
therefore
the
court
doesn't
have
to
reach
the
question
of
whether
the
falbo
doctrine
is
still
good
law.
well,
it
seems
does
that
at
the
outset
that
the
grounds
of
petitioner
seeks
as
making
his
case
a
peculiar
or
unique
one
or
readily
answer,
these
grounds
as
we
understand
it
are
two.
one
is
that
the
question
involved
here
as
a
matter
of
law
or
statutory
interpretation
and
that
the
agencies
of
the
selective
service
system
as
i
take
it
from
the
local
board
through
the
state
appeal
board
all
the
way
up
to
the
national
appeal
board
are
either
incompetent,
unqualified
or
for
some
other
reason
unable
to
pass
on
such
question.
well,
it
seems
to
us
this
is
simply
not
reflective
of
the
fact.
question
was
raised
about
whether
there
are
any
lawyers
on
selective
service
appeal
boards.
the
answer
to
that
is
that
the
regulations
themselves
require
that
one
member
of
each
state
appeal
board
be
a
lawyer.
and
as
a
matter
or
fact
as
to
the
national
appeal
board,
the
chairman
himself
is
a
lawyer.
he's
a
probate
judge.
moreover,
it's
a
little
bit
difficult
to
understand
how
you
can
say
that
certain
issues
are
simply
matters
of
the
law.
every
question
of
classification
involves
questions
of
law
what
the
boards
are
seeking
to
do
is
to
pursuant
to
the
regulations
in
the
statute
as
they
interpret
and
construe
them,
give
each
registrant
the
appropriate
classifications
that
congress
has
determined
that
he
should
have.
they
worked
against
the
background
and
in
the
framework
of
the
selective
service
act
in
the
pertinent
regulations.
there's
no
other
way
that
they
can
operate.
insofar
as
the
statute
itself
is
concern,
it
is
silent
on
this
subject.
it
says
that
local
boards
shall
have
the
power
with
their
respect
to
jurisdictions
to
hear
and
determine
subject
to
the
right
of
appeal
to
the
appeal
boards
here
unauthorized
all
questions
or
claims
with
respect
to
the
inclusion
for
or
exemption
or
deferment
from
training
and
service
of
all
individuals
within
the
jurisdiction
of
these
boards
and
the
similar
provisions
that
relate
to
the
de
novo
a
classification
by
the
appeal
board
and
the
national
board.
so,
it
seems
to
us
that
for
several
reasons
petitioner
is
not
on
sound
ground
when
he
suggests
that
matters
of
law
are
wholly
without
the
competence
of
these
boards.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
this
court
in
cox
versus
united
states
in
332
u.s.
noted
that
questions
of
classification
are
matters
of
the
law
for
the
courts
decide
not
for
the
jury.
it
seems
to
us
that
it's
logical
to
conclude
from
that
that
when
these
local
boards
and
state
appeal
board,
the
national
board
of
passing
on
these
questions
that
necessarily
they're
involved
in
legal
issues.
i
realize
that
there's
a
continuum
that
exists
here.
some
questions
are
more
peculiarly
factual
in
nature
and
some
questions
more
appropriately
legal
in
nature.
now,
what
i'm
seeking
to
point
out
is
that
as
a
local
board
faces
a
question
of
classification
it
has
to
face
that
issue
against
the
backdrop
of
the
selective
service
act
in
a
pertinent
regulations.
those
are
laws
insofar
as
i
know
and
can
determine.
and
therefore
to
say
that
they
can't
--
that
they
had
no
confidence
to
pass
on
these
matters,
it
seems
to
me
is
simply
wrong.
petitioner
also
suggest
that
--
well,
on
that
point
as
was
noted
by
mr.
justice
white
in
conclusion
on
that
point
of
passing
on
statutory
--
question
of
statutory
interpretation
or
law,
it
does
seem
to
us
that
it's
not
an
appropriate
here
to
give
the
administrative
agency
charged
with
the
administration
of
this
act.
a
first
opportunity
to
pass
on
an
important
statutory
question,
petitioner
can
see
as
this
question
is
one
of
first
impression,
the
act
was
amended
in
1964
as
a
great
dearth
of
authority
on
the
whole
meaning
of
the
sole
surviving
son
exemption.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i'm
unclear
what
you
mean
by
that?
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
that's
what
i'm
suggesting
should
obtain
here.
yes,
your
honor.
and
what
the
question
of
first
impression
that
i
refer
to
is
the
statutory
question
of
the
proper
construction
of
the
sole
surviving
son
exemption
which
for
the
first
time
in
1964
included
the
reference
to
fathers
which
it
had
not
concluded
before.
we
--
in
order
we
see
anything
in
the
cases
that
indicates
any
distinction
in
this
regard
and
we
submit
that
therefore
it's
not
inappropriate
that
the
falbo
doctrine
be
construed
to
require
that
on
all
matters
of
classification,
the
administrative
agencies
and
the
administrative
process
be
given
an
opportunity
to
consider
these
questions
in
the
first
instance.
they
weren't
given
this
opportunity
here,
petitioner's
position
are
simply
that
he
didn't
want
anything
to
do
with
the
selective
service
system.
the
record
makes
this
clear.
he
repeatedly
said
he
just
didn't
want
everything
to
do
it
and
wrote
the
board
and
told
them
so.
he
didn't
claim
sole
surviving
son
exemption
himself.
the
board
conferred
it
upon
him
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
he
mentioned
this
your
honor
and
the
board
then
responded
and
sent
him
a
conscientious
objector
form
because
he
had
also
indicated
that
perhaps
he
had
some
reasons
for
filing
that
sort
of
claim.
he
wrote
back
and
said
no
he
didn't
and
then
wrote
back
and
also
said
that
that
he
didn't
even
know
if
he
was
a
sole
surviving
son
by
his
father
had
been
killed
at
world
war
ii.
the
board
then
proceeded
to
quite
a
further
and
obtained
information
that
confirm
the
fact
that
he
was
a
sole
surviving
son
and
his
because
his
father
had
been
killed
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
and
his
mother
was
still
then
alive.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
it's
not
wholly
clear,
it's
clear
as
i
recall
that
one
set
of
grandparents
is
alive
and
at
least
one
grandparent
on
the
other
side
is
alive.
i
have
no
knowledge
of
the
relevance
of
this
and
have
no
way
of
knowing
what
relevance
the
appeal
boards
might
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
there
is
an
information
in
the
record
there
is
a
testimony
in
this
regard
that
it
was
taken
at
trial
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
--
at
his
trial
and
it
appears
that
pages
15
and
16
of
the
appendix
of
the
testimony
was
as
i
recall
by
his
uncle
to
criminal
crime.
the
other
aspect
of
petitioner's
position
that
there's
no
need
to
reach
the
validity
of
the
falbo
doctrine
here
is
that
it
would've
been
futile
in
any
event
to
pursue
his
administrative
remedies.
well,
we
think
that
that's
simply
not
accurate
on
the
facts.
the
administrative
remedies
that
were
available
to
him
were
in
the
first
instance
an
appeal
to
the
state
appeal
board.
and
further,
from
that
decision
an
appeal
to
the
national
appeal
board
if
one,
the
state
appeal
board
had
been
divided
or
two,
even
had
it
not
been
divided.
he
could
have
asked
the
national
or
the
state
director
to
take
the
case
to
the
national
board
upon
his
behalf.
as
the
court
may
recall
this
is
a
situation
that
existed
in
clay
case
and
there
has
been
a
consistent
position
taken
by
the
national
and
state
directors
that
questions
of
importance
in
the
system
will
be
taken
to
the
national
board
on
behalf
of
registrant
even
though
they
don't
have
appeals
as
right.
it
seems
to
us
that
it
would've
been
futile
here
for
petitioner
to
seek
to
exhaust
his
administrative
remedies.
he
refers
to
the
fact
that
advice
was
given
by
the
national
director
and
the
state
director
to
his
local
board
in
response
to
an
inquiry
to
the
effect
that
the
pertinent
section
of
the
act
section
6
(o)
should
be
construed
as
not
allowing
his
statutory
exemption
under
the
circumstances.
well,
that's
true
but
it's
also
true
that
the
national
director
and
the
state
director
are
different
people
and
the
state
appeal
board
and
certainly
for
the
national
appeal
board.
it's
clear
by
statute
that
the
national
appeal
board
is
an
independent
body
responsible
only
to
the
president
and
exercising
the
powers
given
at
the
president
under
the
act
as
his
direct
delegate.
it's
not
responsible
to
the
selective
service
system
or
to
the
director
in
any
way.
the
state
appeal
board
similarly
are
not
required
to
follow
a
bulletin's
advice
whatever
given
by
the
national
director
or
the
state
director.
they
are
required
under
the
law
to
consider
de
novo
of
propriety
of
an
individual's
classification.
so,
it
seems
to
us
that
the
fact
that
in
form
of
advice
was
given
by
the
national
director
and
the
state
director
on
this
matter
is
not
convincing.
there's
one
other
aspect
that
petitioner
seeks
to
rely
upon
the
national
director
promulgated
an
operations
bulletin
in
august
of
1964
shortly
after
the
enactment
of
the
amendment
which
included
for
the
first
time
fathers
within
the
category
of
those
persons
whose
death
may
trigger
the
sole
surviving
son
exemption.
and
that
operations
bulletin
essentially
took
the
position
the
petitioner
here
argues
as
to
the
substantive
issue.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that
he
argues
on
the
substantive
issue
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
--
i.e.
that
the
basic
theory
is
one
of
preservation
of
lineage
rather
than
compassion
or
comfort
whatever.
it
seems
to
us
that
this
is
not
convincing
either.
the
very
fact
that
the
bulletin
was
withdrawn
so
promptly
indicates
there
was
considerable
uncertainty
on
the
part
of
the
national
director
and
moreover
all
of
the
considerations
that
i
mentioned
to
just
previously
regarding
the
role
--
respective
roles
of
the
national
state
directors
and
the
state
appeal
board,
the
national
appeal
board
are
applicable
here
as
well.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
failure
to
report
for
induction.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that's
correct.
the
system
was
changed
as
i
recall
late
in
world
war
ii
but
shortly
after
falbo's,
it
may
have
been
prior
to
estep.
it
became
clear
that
it
just
wasn't
workable
because
you
would
get
all
these
men
down
at
the
induction
center
and
then
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
half
of
would
be.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
so
the
system
since
that
time
with
only
minor
changes
has
been
the
one
that
they
adopted
then
of
preinduction
physical
is
roughly
60
to
90
days
prior
to
the
proposed
induction
day
and
then
if
the
man
passes
it
he's
given
an
order
to
report
for
induction
if
he
fails
because
he's
classified
for
(voice
overlap).
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that's
pursuant
to
army
regulations
not
selective
service
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
--
at
the
induction
station,
yes
your
honor.
petitioner
here
received
two
orders
to
report
for
preinduction
physical.
he
reported
for
neither
one
of
them.
we
point
out
that
one
aspect
at
least
to
the
falbo
doctrine
is
that
an
individual
potentially
subject
to
the
draft
is
required
to
appear
for
physical
examination
simply
because
the
result
of
that
examination
may
be
to
preclude
his
induction.
petitioner
by
failing
to
report,
failing
to
complete
the
administrative
processing
that
is
required,
precluded
any
possibility
of
that
aspect
to
the
falbo
doctrine
being
irrelevant
here.
we
think
then
that
petitioner's
challenge
has
to
be
to
the
falbo
doctrine
itself
and
that
doctrine
is
the
court
well
knows.
it
referred
to
that
doctrine
with
as
we
understand
apparent
approval
in
the
oestereich
case
and
mr.
justice
harlan
also
referred
to
it
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
oestereich.
falbo
and
estep
were
also
cited
in
the
recent
gabriel
decision.
that
doctrine
essentially
is
that
administrative
remedies
provided
within
the
selective
service
system
must
be
exhausted
by
a
registrant
in
order
for
him
to
be
in
a
position
to
challenge
his
classification
in
court
should
he
fails
subsequently
to
report
for
induction.
the
premise
on
which
this
doctrine
is
grounded
is
not
one
foreign
to
the
administrative
law
generally.
it
seems
to
us
that
it
has
peculiar
applicability
in
the
selective
service
context
because
the
basic
underlying
notion
of
the
selective
service
system
is
the
court
recently
in
o'brien
noted
is
the
prompt
mobilization
of
men
when
necessary
in
time
of
war
a
national
emergency
to
serve
the
country.
now,
we
recognize
that
if
falbo
was
overruled,
each
and
every
registrant
is
not
going
to
simply
defy
the
system
as
petitioner
did
here
and
wait
until
he's
prosecuted
criminally
in
order
to
raise
whatever
a
claims
he
has
as
to
the
validity
of
his
classification
but
there
will
be
some
incentive
in
that
regard
provided
and
in
a
time
of
national
emergency,
in
a
time
of
war,
it
seems
to
us
that
if
falbo
is
overruled
there's
some
real
hazards
presented
to
the
effective
operation
of
the
system.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
it's
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
it's
clear
from
a
reading
of
falbo
that
that's
exactly
what
the
court
was
doing
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
it
was
attempted
to
construe.
i
think
rather
the
over
all
act
because
that
the
reference
is
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
under
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
under
section
10
(b)
(3)
is
amended
the
congress
provided
that
such
review,
judicial
review
shall
go
to
the
question
of
the
jurisdiction
here
in
reserve
to
local
boards,
appeal
boards
and
the
president
only
when
there
is
no
basis
in
fact
for
the
classification
assigned
to
such
registrant.
now,
section
10
(b)
(3)
as
the
court
noted
in
oestereich
and
gabriel
also
contemplates
that
review
should
occur
at
that
point
in
time
in
the
process
where
it
would
be
--
would
avoid
as
far
as
possible
the
interruption
of
the
processing
of
the
system.
now,
in
oestereich,
the
court
found
that
the
congress
didn't
intend
that
the
preclusion
on
preinduction
review
be
applicable
in
all
situations.
it
said
that
where
a
specific
statutory
exemption
that
was
clear
and
unequivocal
and
undisputed
existed
that
it
read
the
act
is
not
requiring
the
registrant
to
go
through
the
entire
process
for
asserting
his
claim
and
therefore
found
that
preinduction
review
was
available.
petitioner
suggests
that
the
position
we
take
here
is
somehow
inconsistent
with
oestereich.
we
take
exception
with
that
as
i
noted
previously
the
court
did
refer
in
oestereich
with
apparent
approval
to
the
exhaustion
doctrine.
the
court
noted
that
the
outset
of
the
oestereich
opinion
that
oestereich
had
taken
his
administrative
appeals
and
lost.
petitioner
says
that
oestereich
was
not
required
to
take
a
physical.
well,
it
seems
to
us
that
when
you
have
a
situation
where
preinduction
review
is
available
somewhat
different
approach
necessarily
has
to
be
taken
as
to
what
remedies
need
be
exhausted.
oestereich
exhausted
those
remedies
that
were
relevant
to
the
question
of
whether
his
entitlement
to
the
statutory
exemption
existed
or
not.
on
the
point
that
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
that's
right.
the
exhaustion
that
we
are
referring
to
is
the
pursuit
of
administrative
remedies
prior
to
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
which
oestereich
did
do.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that's
correct.
it
seems
to
us
that
the
court
in
oestereich
was
simply
construing
the
intendment
of
congress
regarding
provisions
that
were
and
apparently
in
some
conflict.
in
gabriel,
the
court
made
clear
that
the
general
preclusion
on
preinduction
review
was
applicable
that
there
are
only
certain
exceptions
that
would
be
permitted.
we
recognized
that
there
are
certain
limited
exemptions
that
have
been
noted
over
the
years
to
the
exhaustion
doctrine.
petitioner
refers
to
a
variety
of
these
and
of
the
cases
in
which
they
have
been
considered.
and
i'd
like
just
to
refer
quickly
to
what
these
are.
one
notion
is
that
you
don't
have
to
exhaust
when
it's
simply
infeasible
or
impracticable
to
do
so.
one
individual
in
the
donato
case
was
off
on
fire
fighting
duty
during
the
period
in
time
and
which
he
had
to
take
his
administrative
appeal
and
the
court
there
said
it
should
be
excused
because
it
just
wasn't
possible
that
the
practicable
for
him
to
do
so.
another
relates
to
a
serious
procedural
irregularity
within
the
system
itself.
in
the
will's
case,
the
petitioner
refers
to
a
some
link
as
we
read
it
that's
the
basic
ground
on
which
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
it
could
excuse
exhaustion.
in
the
will's
case
and
the
notice
of
delinquency
was
not
sent
to
the
registrant
of
the
appropriate
time.
and
therefore,
he
was
in
a
disadvantage
situation
with
respect
to
his
classification
because
he
wasn't
apprise
in
the
timely
fashion
that
sort
of
procedural
or
irregularity
has
been
also
allowed
to
excuse
the
exhaustion
of
administrative
remedy.
in
the
wolf
case,
the
court
of
appeals,
the
second
circuit
discussed
at
some
length
the
falbo
doctrine,
the
exhaustion
of
remedies
doctrine
and
the
selective
service
context
found
it
inapplicable
where
first
amendment
issues
were
a
series
of
first
amendment
questions
were
involved.
that
involved
and
attempted
delinquency
reclassification
of
registrants
for
sitting
in
a
draft
board
in
arbor
michigan.
and
the
court
there
found
that
the
questions
they
raised
under
the
first
amendment
were
comprehended
under
this
court's
doctrine
of
--
in
dombrowski
versus
pfister
and
therefore
an
appropriate
exception
to
the
exhaustion
rule
could
be
permitted.
the
--
another
exception
that's
been
noted
has
to
do
with
whether
the
individual
is
aware
of
his
administrative
remedies
as
will
be
developed
at
greater
length
in
the
subsequent
case
to
burney.
the
procedure
that's
established
here
is
one
that
seeks
to
make
registrants
amply
aware
of
what
rights
they
have.
the
selective
service
classification
certificate
itself
has
we
have
reprinted
in
the
appendix
pages
62
and
63
sets
out
all
the
detail
procedures
that
need
to
be
taken
and
the
time
within
which
these
procedures
need
to
be
followed.
i
should
note
that
subsequent
to
the
operative
facts
in
this
case
the
pertinent
regulations
have
been
amended
so
that
now
the
registrant
has
30
days
instead
of
10
days
within
which
to
take
an
appeal
to
the
state
appeal
board
the
feeling
being
that
some
of
these
cases
relating
to
exceptional
circumstances
had
perhaps
resulted
because
of
the
short
period
of
time
that
had
previously
been
given.
we
make
a
separate
point
of
his
failure
to
report
for
preinduction
physicals
as
i
noted
that
is
a
precise
aspect
of
the
falbo
holding
itself.
falbo
of
course
was
clarified
and
confirmed
in
estep
those
cases
bracketed
together
stand
for
the
exhaustion
doctrine
that
we
here
rely
upon
and
the
courts
below
relied
upon
but
it
seems
to
us
that
it
is
a
somewhat
separate
in
different
thing
is
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
iron's
case
recently
noted
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief
large
numbers
of
registrants
are
unfortunately
found
not
to
be
physically
fit
when
they
take
a
physical.
had
petitioner
taken
a
physical,
we
have
no
way
of
knowing
what
is
physical
condition
is
but
he
may
well
have
been
found
not
to
be
physically
fit
and
therefore
they
would
have
been
no
occasion
to
reach
any
of
their
question
that
is
now
seeks
to
present.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes
your
honor.
the
record
clearly
reflects
that.
he
would
notify
on
each
occasion
where
to
report,
when
to
report
and
he
simply
responded
by
saying
he
didn't
want
to
have
anything
to
deal
with
the
system.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
it's
important
that
as
justice
stewart
pointed
out
subsequent
to
shortly
after
falbo
the
system
was
changed
so
that
preinduction
physicals
are
now
required.
the
purpose
of
that
is
so
that
each
board
will
know
ahead
of
time
what
individuals
it
has
available
physically
qualified
individuals
available
to
meet
each
monthly
call
as
it
occurs.
so,
it
seems
to
us
that
it
is
an
important
aspect
to
the
system
otherwise
the
board
has
no
way
of
knowing
what
this
individual's
situation
or
status
is.
and
so
therefore,
we
think
that
there's
an
independent
ground
here
as
petitioner
notes
he
wasn't
charged
with
failure
to
report
for
physical
exam.
and
we
realize
that
but
in
the
context
of
the
applicability
of
the
exhaustion
doctrine
our
point
simply
is
that
this
is
another
aspect
that
we
think
should
be
taken
into
account.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well,
if
petitioner
prevails
on
the
broad
ground
that
the
falbo
doctrine
should
be
overruled
and
therefore
that
exhaustion
of
administrative
remedy
is
no
longer
required.
it
seems
to
me
that
there
are
at
least
two
principal
disadvantages
that
would
result.
one,
operation
of
the
selective
service
system
itself
would
be
subject
to
serious
disruption
because
individuals
would
not
be
required
to
pursue
remedies
through
the
system
as
elaborate
machinery
that
congress
in
the
present
have
established
to
consider
and
pass
upon
claims
to
classification
would
--
could
be
deliberately
and
effectively
bypass.
indeed,
that's
what
petitioner
sought
to
do
here
we
think
simply
deliberately
bypass
this
whole
system.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
it
seems
to
us
it
could
well
create
very
serious
delays
and
disruptions
because
there
would
be
no
way
of
knowing
if
individuals
did
not
pursue
their
administrative
remedies
and
if
individuals
did
not
report
for
preinduction
physicals,
no
way
of
knowing
from
month
to
month.
those
individuals
that
were
available
that
the
system
is
set
up
not
to
put
people
in
jail
and
to
prosecute
them
but
for
violations
of
the
act
but
to
properly
classify
and
induct
them
into
the
service
and
it
seems
to
us
that
the
whole
administrative
machinery
is
directed
toward
that
purpose
insuring
a
proper
classification
and
insuring
that
there
is
a
steady
continuous
flow
of
manpower
when
needed
for
the
armed
services.
and
it
seems
to
us
that
if
the
exhaustion
doctrine
is
abandoned
that
will
be
interfered
way.
the
other
aspect
it
seems
to
us
of
this
is
simply
that
when
the
administrative
agencies
are
bypassed
the
load
of
litigation
in
the
courts
is
commensurately
will
increased
and
the
courts
are
going
to
be
forced
to
pass
on
these
questions
without
any
gloss
of
administrative
interpretation
or
construction
and
without
screening
and
reading
out
of
cases
that
would
be
taken
care
of
through
following
the
administrative
process.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
i
think
that's
essentially
what
the
court
did
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that
section
is
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
--
is
as
i
recall
that
section
is
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
--part
of
a
long
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
provision
that
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
that's
correct.
it
was
of
course
amended
the
whole
long
provision
460
(b)
(3).
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor
and
the
--
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
congress
ratified
this
court's
construction
of
that
language
in
the
falbo
and
estep
cases
by
providing
that
no
basis
in
fact
standard
should
be
the
one
that's
applied
in
judicial
review
here.
that
of
course
is
the
provision
that
the
language
that
estep
adopted
in
delineating
the
stand
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
well
i
would
like
to
think
that
that's
the
end
of
the
case
and
it
seem
--
mr.
francis
x.
beytagh,
jr.
as
i
understand
it
it's
not
the
end
of
the
case
because
over
the
years
certain
exceptions
have
been
carved
out
to
this
doctrine
and
petitioner
suggests
that
his
case
fits
within
some
of
this
exception.
our
position
is
twofold,
one,
these
exceptions
are
not
applicable
here
and
in
any
event
the
falbo
doctrine
should
be
upheld.thank
you.
