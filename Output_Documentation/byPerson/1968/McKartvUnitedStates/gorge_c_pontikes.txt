mr.
gorge
c.
pontikes
good
morning
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
matter
comes
before
the
court
on
the
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals
which
a
firm
a
judgment
on
conviction
for
willfully
and
knowingly
failing
and
neglecting
to
report
for
induction
in
violation
of
section
462,
title
50
appendix.
the
court
below
found
that
that
is
the
trial
court
found
the
petitioner
could
not
raise
a
defense
of
valid
or
invalid
reclassification
because
he
had
exhausted
his
administrative
remedies.
this
position
was
affirmed
by
the
sixth
court
of
appeals
and
when
the
writ
of
certiorari
was
granted
as
petitioner
understood
it
there
were
two
questions
to
be
present
before
the
court.
one
was,
whether
or
not
the
petitioner
was
required
to
exhaust
his
administrative
remedies
under
the
circumstances
and
the
other
is
whether
or
not
the
interpretation
of
section
456
(o)
of
title
50
appendix
namely
the
sole
surviving
exemption
provision
whether
that
the
interpretation
of
that
provision
by
selected
service
was
correct.
the
facts
in
this
case
really
are
simple
and
are
not
in
dispute.
the
petitioner
was
born
february
13,
1943.
he
was
first
classified
by
local
board
number
9
of
public
county
1
(a)
on
february
26,
1963.
he
was
ordered
for
a
pre-induction
physical
examination
on
march
23,
1964,
the
examination
that
take
place
april
21,
1964.
he
did
not
respond
to
that
examination
or
didn't
show
up.
he
was
then
classified
as
a
delinquent
by
his
local
board
and
on
may
1,
1964
they
ordered
him
to
report
for
induction
on
may
11,
1964.
on
may
10th,
he
wrote
a
letter
to
the
board
indicating
that
he
disagreed
the
whole
concept
of
selective
service
and
at
that
point
the
board
replied
and
asked
him
whether
he
wanted
to
apply
his
conscientious
objector.
in
later,
communications
he
indicated
that
he
did
not
--
the
board
has
also
inquired
as
to
why
he
checked
the
box
on
his
original
classification
questionnaire
indicating
that
he
was
a
sole
surviving
son.
there
was
some
additional
correspondence
that
came
to
light
that
his
father
had
died
as
a
navigator
in
the
air
force
during
world
war
ii.
thereupon,
on
july
27,
1967
--
the
four,
pardon
me,
he
was
classified
4
(a)
by
his
local
board.
that
classification
remained
in
effect
until
february
14
of
1966.
now,
on
january
30,
1966,
local
board
number
9
came
to
the
information
that
jack
mckart's
mother
had
died,
petitioner's
mother
had
died.
that
left
mckart
without
a
“family
unit”
meaning
that
he
had
no
sisters
and
both
his
parents
were
now
deceased.
now,
on
basis
of
that
information,
the
local
board
contacted
the
state
director
for
selected
service
of
ohio
who
determined
that
because
there
was
no
“family
unit”
the
petitioner
was
no
longer
eligible
for
the
sole
surviving
son
exemption.
therefore,
he
was
reclassified
on
february
14,
1966.
on
february
24,
1966,
he
was
ordered
for
another
pre-induction
physical
examination
on
march
17,
1966.
he
did
not
respond
and
he
wrote
and
told
the
board
he
would
not
respond.
thereupon,
he
was
again
classified
as
a
delinquent
and
as
a
delinquent
on
march
31,
1966
he
was
ordered
to
report
for
induction
on
april
21,
1966.
the
trial
of
this
matter
was
held
on
may
16,
1967
where
he
was
convicted
by
the
lower
court
and
given
a
sentence
of
three
years
in
the
custody
of
the
attorney
general.
now,
your
honors
before
we
proceed
into
the
--
i
think
question
that
is
of
main
interest
to
the
court,
i
want
to
say
first
of
all,
we
as
petitioners
understood
that
both
the
question
of
the
exhaustion
of
the
administrative
remedies
and
the
question
of
the
correct
interpretation
of
456
is
before
the
court.
the
respondent,
united
states
of
america
has
chosen
not
to
brief
the
question
of
whether
or
not
selective
service's
interpretation
of
section
456
is
correct.
they
have
not
argued
that
at
all.
we
would
therefore
maintain
that
they
have
in
effect
conceded
our
position
that
i
will
allow
them
to
speak
for
themselves.
therefore,
i
will
deal
exclusively
with
the
exhaustion
question.
further,
i
feel
that
this
is
a
question
of
a
major
importance
in
this
case.
let
me
start
off
by
saying
that
a
contrary
--
mr.
gorge
c.
pontikes
they
did
not
your
honor
and
neither
that
the
district
court
because
they
felt
that
it
was
not
necessary
given
the
posture
of
the
case.
we
would
like
to
make
clear
that
we
are
not
asking
this
court
to
overrule
its
finding
or
its
position
in
united
states
versus
falbo
or
estep
versus
the
united
states.
the
government
--
the
first
part
of
the
government's
brief
treats
our
positions
if
we
are
asking
the
court
to
overrule
falbo
and
estep
and
we
are
not.
secondly,
we
do
not
think
that
the
fact
that
the
petitioner
in
this
case
was
in
the
words
of
the
government's
brief
deliberately
and
flagrantly
avoiding
selective
service
and
refusing
to
have
anything
to
do
with
selective
service
really
has
any
bearing
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
he
had
to
exhaust
his
administrative
remedies.
i
think
the
question
of
whether
or
not
he
had
to
exhaust
his
administrative
remedies
is
questioned
to
be
decided
entirely
apart
from
his
own
particular
attitudes
toward
selective
service.
now,
then
as
to
the
exhaustion
uestion
i
think
first
we
have
to
take
up
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
petitioner
had
to
appeal
his
original
reclassification
and
on
that
question
we
would
--
our
position
is
as
follows,
first
and
foremost,
if
the
classification
or
the
reclassification
on
february
14,
1966
was
based
upon
a
completely
erroneous
interpretation
of
section
456,
we
would
maintain
that
this
was
an
act
beyond
the
jurisdiction
of
local
board
number
9
and
on
that
basis
as
has
been
often
said
in
this
court.
there
is
no
need
to
exhaust;
this
is
an
act
beyond
jurisdiction
of
the
board.
it
is
an
act
totally
prohibited
by
the
statute
and
on
that
basis
we
would
maintain
first
of
all
that
there
was
no
need
for
him
to
appeal.
secondly
and
concomitantly,
we
would
say
that
this
was
a
pure
question
of
law.
that
is
to
say
the
local
boards
both
local
boards
and
the
state
appeal
boards
are
not
competent
to
make
legal
judgments.
i
believe
as
recently
as
the
case
of
oestereich
versus
selective
service
system
number
46
in
this
court,
justice
harlan
very
properly
and
very
incisively
pointed
out
that
the
nature
of
selective
service
boards
are
such
that
they
are
not
equipped
to
deal
with
judicial
questions.
mr.
gorge
c.
pontikes
i
believe
justice
white
that
you
will
find
that
the
appeal
boards
are
made
up
of
the
same
types
of
persons
as
the
local
boards
are
made
up
of.
in
other
words,
if
you
take
local
boards,
then
the
state
appeal
boards
and
finally
the
national
selective
service
board
which
is
made
up
of
three
members.
all
three
boards
do
not
have
persons
who
have
any
judicial
competence.
they
are
not
equipped
to
give
render
any
kind
of
judicial
decisions
whatsoever.
these
are
persons
who
are
uncompensated,
they
hold
no
formal
hearings,
they
require
no
legal
briefs
as
again
as
justice
harlan
pointed
out
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
oestereich
that
no
lawyers
are
allowed.
in
fact,
they
are
specifically
prohibited
by
selective
service
regulation
to
appear
before
the
local
boards.
on
this
basis,
we
would
maintain
that
this
boards
both
cannot
in
fact
make
any
judicial
decisions
and
furthermore
because
they
cannot
they
generally
do
not
and
follow
--
mr.
gorge
c.
pontikes
quite
correct.
mr.
gorge
c.
pontikes
that
is
a
judicial
function,
i
would
agree
and
perhaps
the
word
“judicial”
is
a
little
bit
too
broad
for
our
position.
i
would
say
they
are
not
qualified
to
make
interpretations
of
law,
statutory
constructions
or
constitutional
decisions.
i
would
say
that
those
are
the
types
of
judicial
functions
that
they
are
not
competent
to
engage
--
mr.
gorge
c.
pontikes
oh,
i
would
say
so
your
honor
but
i
think
there,
you
have
an
entirely
different
apparatus.
you
have
for
example
an
adversary
process
which
you
do
not
have
in
selective
service.
the
selective
service
system
is
not
intended
to
be
an
adversary
process
and
the
reason
is
not
intended
to
be
an
adversary
process
is
because
it
is
geared
to
mobilize
manpower
in
a
short
period
of
time.
so,
it
is
not,
it's
simply
is
not
equipped
on
that
basis.
secondly,
as
part
of
the
adversary
process,
you
have
lawyers
appearing
for
both
parties
before
administrative
--
for
a
number
of
parties
before
an
administrative
agency.
you
don't
have
that
in
selective
service.
mr.
gorge
c.
pontikes
well,
i
would
say
that
the
--
what
we
are
saying
is
that
the
act,
the
decision
on
their
part
to
reclassify
in
february
14,
1966
was
an
act
beyond
their
jurisdiction
because
we
contend
that
the
petitioner
was
entitled
to
his
sole
surviving
son
exemption
even
though
his
mother
had
died.
our
contention
is
to
the
statutory
construction
question
justice
harlan
is
that
that
was
a
completely
erroneous
interpretation
of
the
law
and
therefore
that
reclassification
was
an
act
beyond
their
jurisdiction,
that's
our
position.
mr.
gorge
c.
pontikes
that's
correct.
mr.
gorge
c.
pontikes
you
mean
if
the
statute
made
that
requirement?
mr.
gorge
c.
pontikes
i
would
say
that
--
mr.
gorge
c.
pontikes
no,
i'm
not
making
a
constitutional
argument
here
justice
white.
mr.
gorge
c.
pontikes
we
certainly
are
as
to
456
and
we
are
arguing
that
--
mr.
gorge
c.
pontikes
well,
and
but
we
are
further
saying
no
we're
not
saying
--
mr.
gorge
c.
pontikes
no,
i
think
the
decision
in
falbo
was
based
if
i
may
say
on
two
points.
one
was
the
fact
that
in
falbo
if
the
court
will
recall,
nick
falbo
was
seeking
a
4
(d)
classification
as
a
minister
and
this
is
essentially
a
factual
question
within
the
competency
--
mr.
gorge
c.
pontikes
i
would
say
that
it's
a
--
myself
that
it's
a
judicially
imposed
doctrine.
the
selective
service
law
says
that
the
decisions
of
the
boards
of
selective
service
shall
be
final
and
that
was
the
law
up
until
july
1
of
1967
at
which
time
was
added
the
now
section
10
(b)
(3)
which
this
court
had
occasion
to
construe
recently
where
it
said
that
there
will
be
no
review
until
there
has
been
either
--
there's
going
to
response
to
an
order
to
report
for
induction
either
affirmatively
or
negatively
and
then
only
the
review
will
only
encompass
the
question
whether
the
board
had
jurisdiction
as
a
matter
of
basis
and
fact.
but
there
is
no
requirement
to
my
knowledge
within
selective
service
law
that
requires
the
exhaustion.
i
would
say
that
falbo
if
you
will
judicially
impose
the
exhaustion
principle
on
the
grounds
that
--
on
the
general
grounds
applying
to
all
administrative
agencies.
i
don't
think
at
that
point
that
is
as
to
the
appeal
process
they
were
drawing
a
distinction
between
selective
service
and
other
agencies.
mr.
gorge
c.
pontikes
i
don't
think
it
ever
--
in
my
recollection
of
the
reading
of
the
falbo
decision,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that
question
specifically
as
to
the
intent
of
congress
was
ever
raised.
i
do
feel
that
in
falbo
the
primary
motivation
of
the
court
and
a
primary
thinking
of
the
court
was
based
upon
its
conception
of
the
reason
for
selective
service
and
theory
being
that
because
there
was
a
mobilization
that
this
was
a
system
to
mobilize
manpower
that
was
necessary
that
you
require
an
exhaustion
and
further
that
you
require
a
completion
of
the
administrative
process
before
there
could
be
a
defense
raise
in
a
criminal
prosecution.
you
will
recall
justice
white
that
prior
to
falbo
and
estep
the
courts
throughout
the
nation
read
selective
service
as
to
allow
no
defense
whatsoever
to
criminal
prosecutions.
there
was
--
so
that
this
was
a
--
at
that
time,
an
opening
up
of
the
original
statutory
scheme.
now,
our
position
as
to
the
exhaustion
is
based
--
mr.
gorge
c.
pontikes
what
was
thought
to
be
–
correct,
your
honor.
what
was
thought
to
be
the
statutory
scheme,
i
stand
corrected.
our
position
as
to
exhaustion
is
really
based
on
the
fact
that
number
one,
this
is
a
pure
question
of
law
and
coupled
with
the
fact
that
the
appellate
exercise
here
would
be
a
pure
futility.
the
national
director
had
already
indicated
his
construction
of
statute
456.
the
state
director
of
ohio
had
indicated
his
position.
the
local
board
had
adopted
these
positions
and
for
the
petitioner
to
be
required
under
these
circumstances
to
engage
in
these
appeals
would
have
been
pure
futility.
the
government
makes
or
attempts
to
make
the
argument
that
the
state
appeal
board
does
have
the
duty
under
the
requisite
regulations
and
statutes
to
classify
de
novo.
now,
that
is
a
theoretical
duty,
there's
no
question
about
that
but
i
would
say
as
we
said
in
our
reply
brief
that
would
be
a
departure
from
reality
for
the
government
to
contend
that
as
a
practical
matter.
this
occurs
when
the
issue
is
one
of
statutory
construction.
if
for
the
issue
were
one
of
a
factual
determination,
there
might
be
grounds
for
disagreement
between
the
national
director
and
the
appellate
processes
but
where
the
local
board
or
the
state
appeal
board
or
even
the
national
appeal
board
is
faced
with
a
question
of
pure
statutory
construction
was
this
case
involved.
then
there's
no
question
in
my
mind
that
in
99
out
of
a
hundred
cases
they
will
follow
the
national
director.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
this
was
recognized
by
the
court
in
sicurella
versus
the
united
states
where
a
state
appeal
board
had
before
it
a
determination
not
by
the
national
director
but
by
the
justice
department
in
its
conscientious
objector
section,
an
opinion
that
sicurella
was
not
a
conscientious
objector
because
he
was
not
opposed
to
theocratic
war.
and
at
that
time,
the
court
found
that
this
was
an
error
of
law
in
the
determination
by
the
justice
department
and
then
concluded
that
the
appeal
board
probably
followed
this
recommendation
because
there
was
an
authoritative
source
and
thereby
reversed
the
conviction.
certainly,
if
a
state
appeal
board
is
going
to
follow
the
justice
department.
it
will
most
certainly
follow
the
legal
opinions
of
national
director.
mr.
gorge
c.
pontikes
no,
there
is
not.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
theory
of
the
law
justice
marshall
is
--
mr.
gorge
c.
pontikes
there
may
or
may
not
be
lawyers.
mr.
gorge
c.
pontikes
not
as
a
members
necessarily.
mr.
gorge
c.
pontikes
well,
on
some
depending
on
who
in
the
community.
mr.
gorge
c.
pontikes
i
have
absolutely
no
idea.
mr.
gorge
c.
pontikes
well,
i
can't
assume
that
none
--
mr.
gorge
c.
pontikes
i
can't
assume
that
none
of
them
are
justice
marshall.
mr.
gorge
c.
pontikes
i
can
say
however
though
that
on
the
basis
of
the
way
in
which
the
boards
operate
and
on
the
fact
that
they
are
required
by
regulation
statute
to
be
broadly
representative
of
the
entire
community
that
--
mr.
gorge
c.
pontikes
oh,
yes
i
would
very
definitely
say
so.
mr.
gorge
c.
pontikes
that's
correct.
mr.
gorge
c.
pontikes
it
certainly
doesn't
involve.
no.
mr.
gorge
c.
pontikes
pardon
me.
justice
white.
mr.
gorge
c.
pontikes
you
mean
the
in
terms
of
what,
the
appeal?
mr.
gorge
c.
pontikes
by
the
registrant?
mr.
gorge
c.
pontikes
that's
right.
that's
correct.
mr.
gorge
c.
pontikes
no,
he
felt
his
moral
convictions
were
such
that
he
felt
that
he
could
not.
mr.
gorge
c.
pontikes
well,
what
i'm
saying
you
asked
me
the
reason
why
he
didn't
file
his
appeal
and
he
felt
that
this
would
be
cooperating
with
the
system
that
he
felt
was
evil.
mr.
gorge
c.
pontikes
oh,
no
we're
not
saying
that
at
all.
we're
saying
you
do
not
have
to
exhaust
you're
administrative
remedies
because
as
we
have
pointed
out
this
is
a
pure
question
of
law.
the
agency
had
already
made
its
determination
and
there
was
no
question
that
the
appeal
process
would
be
a
futility.
mr.
gorge
c.
pontikes
pardon
me.
mr.
gorge
c.
pontikes
no.
i
would
say
it's
the
reality
of
the
experience
of
the
agencies.
mr.
gorge
c.
pontikes
no.
that's
true.
but
the
fact
decision
is
a
different
matter
as
we
have
pointed
out
and
that's
really
our
--
the
point
at
which
this
case
is
distinguished
from
the
falbo
and
estep
kind
of
rational,
the
doctrines
embodied
in
those
cases.
in
those
cases,
both
of
them,
the
boards
had
to
determine
whether
or
not
a
person
was
a
minister
and
this
is
essentially
a
factual
determination
to
be
made
upon
the
evidence
presented
by
the
individual
registrant.
here,
in
the
case
of
mckart,
the
matter
is
one
of
strictly
one
of
the
interpretation
of
section
456
namely,
was
mckart
to
be
deprived
of
his
4
(a)
exemption
because
he
had
no
family
unit
left
and
we
would
maintain
that
where
that
is
the
issue
and
where
the
agency
in
this
case
selective
service
had
already
made
up
its
mind
that
mckart
was
not
entitled
to
the
exemption
that
for
him
to
be
required
to
go
through
the
appeal's
process
would've
been
a
complete
futility.
now,
we
go
to
the
other
aspect
of
the
government's
position
which
is
that
independent
of
mckart
having
failed
to
exhaust
his
administrative
remedies
he
ought
at
least
to
have
been
required
to
take
physical
examination.
now,
as
to
that
i
call
this
court's
attention
respectfully
to
its
recent
decision
in
oestereich
versus
the
selective
service
system
where
in
a
case
very
similar
to
this
one
the
court
did
not
require
oestereich
to
take
a
physical
examination.
if
the
court
will
read
the
record
carefully
in
the
oestereich
decision
you
will
see
that
there
oestereich
was
not
told
that
before
he
could
obtain
his
remedy
by
way
of
civil
relief
that
he
was
required
to
go
in
and
either
fail
or
pass
a
physical
examination.
now,
as
a
matter
of
fact
as
far
as
we
can
determine
and
i've
read,
checked
the
appendix
in
oestereich,
i
may
able
to
read
the
complete
record
but
as
far
as
i
can
determine
in
the
oestereich
decision
oestereich
never
did
take
physical
examination.
and
i
would
say
that
if
oestereich
is
not
required
to
take
a
physical
examination
as
a
precondition
for
giving
him
civil
relief
then
certainly
i
do
not
think
that
jack
mckart
ought
to
be
required
to
take
a
physical
examination
where
it
would
otherwise
be
futile
for
him
to
exhaust
his
administrative
remedies.
and
that's
the
case
we
had
here.
secondly,
i
think
the
requirement
in
selective
service
law
that
a
physical
examination
be
taken
loses
its
force
in
this
kind
of
case,
i
think
it
has
great
force
in
the
cases
involving
men
like
falbo
and
estep
where
there
are
essentially
factual
determinations
to
be
made
by
the
boards.
there,
i
think
the
court
in
the
interest
of
maintaining
the
speed
and
mobility
of
selective
service
and
in
the
interest
of
not
flooding
the
courts
with
litigation.
there,
there
is
good
reason
for
this
court
to
require
the
taking
of
physical
examination
but
in
the
case
like
mckart's
where
the
issue
is
one
of
statutory
interpretation
i
think
there
is
a
greater
interest
in
having
this
court
determined
the
correct
interpretation
of
the
federal
law.
we're
dealing
here
with
the
interpretation
of
federal
law
and
i
would
say
that
there's
a
greater
interest
in
having
this
court
determine
the
correct
interpretation
of
the
federal
law
and
also
the
fact
because
these
cases
will
occur
less
often.
and
there
is
less
danger
having
the
flood
gates
of
litigation
opened.
i
would
say
finally
on
connection
with
this
point
that
is
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief
an
irony
that
jack
mckart
should
be
ordered
for
a
physical
examination
on
the
basis
of
a
reclassification
that
we
consider
faintly
invalid
because
without
that
reclassification
under
the
existing
selective
service
regulations
he
could
not
be
required
to
take
a
physical
examination.
he
was
not
1
(a)
and
he
was
not
shortly
to
be
inducted
which
are
the
only
two
grounds
upon
which
a
physical
examination
can
be
required.
so,
on
that
basis
it
would
strike
us
as
being
the
most
anomalous
situation
that
he
ought
to
be
barred
from
raising
the
statutory
--
the
incorrect
statutory
interpretation
by
the
fact
that
he
did
not
take
a
physical
examination
which
in
itself
could
not
have
been
required
had
the
reclassification
not
been
made.
i
want
to
reserve
some
time
for
rebuttal.
thank
you
for
your
kind
attention.
mr.
gorge
c.
pontikes
thank
you.
may
it
please
the
court.
i
just
want
to
cover
some
of
the
matters
that
were
raised
by
the
government.
again,
i
must
insist
to
the
court
that
we
are
not
seeking
to
overrule
the
position
taken
by
this
court
in
falbo
and
estep.
it
seems
to
us
fundamental
that
there
is
a
crucial
distinction
to
be
drawn
between
the
falbo-estep
situation
where
a
local
board
makes
certain
factual
determinations
comes
to
conclusion
and
then
there
is
a
requirement
that
there
will
be
an
exhaustion
and
the
taking
away
physical.
now,
in
that
particular
case,
you
do
not
have
a
pure
statutory
question
of
pure
statutory
construction
that
you
have
in
this
case.
there's
no
factual
dispute
in
this
case
whatsoever.
there
is
no
fact
--
factual
decision
that
the
system
had
to
make
at
all.
it
was
a
pure
question
of
law.
further,
as
the
courts
have
recognized
where
an
administrative
process
or
the
taking
of
administrative
appeals
would
be
futile
then
the
aggrieved
party
is
not
required
to
take
those
administrative
processes.
now,
for
the
government
to
tell
us
here
that
the
state
appeal
board
is
going
to
operate
independently
of
the
directions
of
the
national
director
is
really
to
find
the
face
of
reality.
i
call
your
attention
your
attention
to
the
wolf
case
specifically
in
wolf
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals
found
that
the
national
as
you
recall
in
that
case
the
registrants
who
filed
the
suit
asking
for
preinduction
relief
had
not
exhausted
any
administrative
remedies
whatsoever.
they
have
been
reclassified
by
their
local
boards
and
thereupon
when
and
asking
for
a
declaratory
judgment
to
declare
that
their
classifications
were
invalid
and
based
upon
unconstitutional
considerations.
in
wolf,
the
court
found
that
the
national
director
had
clearly
stated
his
position
and
they
found
other
conditions
to
indicate
that
the
system
had
already
made
up
its
mind
and
we
would
say
the
same
conditions
apply
here.
the
system
had
made
up
its
mind
and
for
the
government
to
tell
us
now
--
mr.
gorge
c.
pontikes
correct.
very
much
so
justice
stewart.
there
was
--
i
would
say
that
the
possibilities
of
a
state
appeal
board
overturning
or
flying
in
the
face
of
this
construction
of
the
statute
would
be
if
not
impossible
certainly
practically
impossible.
secondly,
i
would
point
as
far
as
the
case
reaching
the
national
selective
service
appeal
board,
i
would
point
out
to
the
court
that
by
the
statistics
of
the
government
itself
there
were
only
479
split
decisions
heard
by
the
national
selective
service
appeal
board.
the
split
decision
is
a
decision
where
there's
a
dissent
on
state
appeal
board.
this
is
in
the
first
six
months
of
1968.
in
fiscal
1967,
the
state
appeal
boards
heard
119,167
cases.
so,
if
you
take
those
two
figures
and
put
them
together
you'll
get
an
idea
of
how
possible
it
is
first
of
all
for
this
case
ever
to
have
reached
the
national
appeal
board.
secondly,
even
though
the
cases
indicates
some
disagreement
with
the
national
state
director,
there's
no
showing
that
the
cases
decided
by
the
national
board
were
decided
on
questions
of
legal
interpretation
of
the
statute.
we
would
rather
assume
that
there
were
questions
and
which
facts
--
they
were
factual
determinations
made
in
disagreement
with
the
national
director
and
the
state
director.
mr.
gorge
c.
pontikes
well,
that's
the
point
i
made
at
the
outset
justice
harlan.
mr.
gorge
c.
pontikes
i
would,
i
think
--
mr.
gorge
c.
pontikes
i
don't
think
the
fact
that
the
petitioner
dislike
selective
service
and
therefore
or
had
more
convictions
about
its
operations
and
felt
compelled
not
to
cooperate
with
it
but
that
fact
has
any
bearing
whether
he
had
to
exhaust
his
administrative
remedies
because
it
seems
to
me
that
the
question
of
exhaustion
is
depended
on
issues
that
are
wholly
unrelated
to
his
particular
attitude.
furthermore
as
far
as
forcing
some
kind
of
compliance
by
not
upholding
the
petitioner's
position
to
this
case.
petitioner
was
not
reading
supreme
court
decision.
his
decision
not
to
cooperate
was
based
wholly
upon
his
own
moral
considerations.
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
what
might
happen
to
him.
so,
that's
the
reason
i
don't
think
the
two
are
related
at
all
in
any
sense
either
practically
illegally.
now,
briefly
to
cover
this
question
of
the
grandparents
--
mr.
gorge
c.
pontikes
oh,
i
think
there
we
have
the
pickens
versus
cox
situation.
mr.
gorge
c.
pontikes
which
is
a
sole
surviving
son
drafted
into
the
army
without
giving
any
information
to
his
board
whatsoever
and
thereupon
after
court
martial
seeking
by
way
of
habeas
corpus
to
be
released
on
the
grounds
that
there
was
no
jurisdiction
that
taken
to
the
army
the
first
place
and
there,
the
pickens
court
quietly
held
that
under
those
circumstances
he
had
waived
his
right.
i
point
out
to
the
court
here
--
mr.
gorge
c.
pontikes
well,
i
think
there
wouldn't
be
a
question
so
much
of
exhaustion
but
on
the
fact
that
he
had
complete
waived
his
right
to
even
claim
that
exemption
because
he
had
not
supplied
the
information
at
all.
mr.
gorge
c.
pontikes
well,
i
would
say
no
for
the
following
reasons.
when
he
was
asked
to
supply
this
information
he
did
not
feel
that
this
was
a
violation
of
his
moral
principles.
so,
he
did
supply
the
information.
if
you
will
look
--
i
don't
have
the
exhibit
number
handy
but
you
will
note
when
he
was
asked
simply
specific
questionnaire
asking
for
the
name
of
his
father,
the
date
of
death
and
other
relevant
information
all
of
this
he
readily
supplied
because
he
felt
this
was
not
a
form
of
cooperation
--
i
see
the
red
light
is
flashing
--
a
form
of
cooperation
which
violate
his
moral
position.
so,
on
that
sense
he
did
not
waive
it
and
therefore
i
don't
think
the
issue
is
the
case
here.
mr.
gorge
c.
pontikes
certainly
not
but
we
say
--
this
court
faced
that
same
position
in
oestereich
justice
marshall
and
there
they
did
not
require
oestereich
(voice
overlap).
mr.
gorge
c.
pontikes
no.
thank
you
my
time
is
over.
thank
you.
mr.
gorge
c.
pontikes
good
morning
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
matter
comes
before
the
court
on
the
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals
which
a
firm
a
judgment
on
conviction
for
willfully
and
knowingly
failing
and
neglecting
to
report
for
induction
in
violation
of
section
462,
title
50
appendix.
the
court
below
found
that
that
is
the
trial
court
found
the
petitioner
could
not
raise
a
defense
of
valid
or
invalid
reclassification
because
he
had
exhausted
his
administrative
remedies.
this
position
was
affirmed
by
the
sixth
court
of
appeals
and
when
the
writ
of
certiorari
was
granted
as
petitioner
understood
it
there
were
two
questions
to
be
present
before
the
court.
one
was,
whether
or
not
the
petitioner
was
required
to
exhaust
his
administrative
remedies
under
the
circumstances
and
the
other
is
whether
or
not
the
interpretation
of
section
456
(o)
of
title
50
appendix
namely
the
sole
surviving
exemption
provision
whether
that
the
interpretation
of
that
provision
by
selected
service
was
correct.
the
facts
in
this
case
really
are
simple
and
are
not
in
dispute.
the
petitioner
was
born
february
13,
1943.
he
was
first
classified
by
local
board
number
9
of
public
county
1
(a)
on
february
26,
1963.
he
was
ordered
for
a
pre-induction
physical
examination
on
march
23,
1964,
the
examination
that
take
place
april
21,
1964.
he
did
not
respond
to
that
examination
or
didn't
show
up.
he
was
then
classified
as
a
delinquent
by
his
local
board
and
on
may
1,
1964
they
ordered
him
to
report
for
induction
on
may
11,
1964.
on
may
10th,
he
wrote
a
letter
to
the
board
indicating
that
he
disagreed
the
whole
concept
of
selective
service
and
at
that
point
the
board
replied
and
asked
him
whether
he
wanted
to
apply
his
conscientious
objector.
in
later,
communications
he
indicated
that
he
did
not
--
the
board
has
also
inquired
as
to
why
he
checked
the
box
on
his
original
classification
questionnaire
indicating
that
he
was
a
sole
surviving
son.
there
was
some
additional
correspondence
that
came
to
light
that
his
father
had
died
as
a
navigator
in
the
air
force
during
world
war
ii.
thereupon,
on
july
27,
1967
--
the
four,
pardon
me,
he
was
classified
4
(a)
by
his
local
board.
that
classification
remained
in
effect
until
february
14
of
1966.
now,
on
january
30,
1966,
local
board
number
9
came
to
the
information
that
jack
mckart's
mother
had
died,
petitioner's
mother
had
died.
that
left
mckart
without
a
“family
unit”
meaning
that
he
had
no
sisters
and
both
his
parents
were
now
deceased.
now,
on
basis
of
that
information,
the
local
board
contacted
the
state
director
for
selected
service
of
ohio
who
determined
that
because
there
was
no
“family
unit”
the
petitioner
was
no
longer
eligible
for
the
sole
surviving
son
exemption.
therefore,
he
was
reclassified
on
february
14,
1966.
on
february
24,
1966,
he
was
ordered
for
another
pre-induction
physical
examination
on
march
17,
1966.
he
did
not
respond
and
he
wrote
and
told
the
board
he
would
not
respond.
thereupon,
he
was
again
classified
as
a
delinquent
and
as
a
delinquent
on
march
31,
1966
he
was
ordered
to
report
for
induction
on
april
21,
1966.
the
trial
of
this
matter
was
held
on
may
16,
1967
where
he
was
convicted
by
the
lower
court
and
given
a
sentence
of
three
years
in
the
custody
of
the
attorney
general.
now,
your
honors
before
we
proceed
into
the
--
i
think
question
that
is
of
main
interest
to
the
court,
i
want
to
say
first
of
all,
we
as
petitioners
understood
that
both
the
question
of
the
exhaustion
of
the
administrative
remedies
and
the
question
of
the
correct
interpretation
of
456
is
before
the
court.
the
respondent,
united
states
of
america
has
chosen
not
to
brief
the
question
of
whether
or
not
selective
service's
interpretation
of
section
456
is
correct.
they
have
not
argued
that
at
all.
we
would
therefore
maintain
that
they
have
in
effect
conceded
our
position
that
i
will
allow
them
to
speak
for
themselves.
therefore,
i
will
deal
exclusively
with
the
exhaustion
question.
further,
i
feel
that
this
is
a
question
of
a
major
importance
in
this
case.
let
me
start
off
by
saying
that
a
contrary
--
mr.
gorge
c.
pontikes
they
did
not
your
honor
and
neither
that
the
district
court
because
they
felt
that
it
was
not
necessary
given
the
posture
of
the
case.
we
would
like
to
make
clear
that
we
are
not
asking
this
court
to
overrule
its
finding
or
its
position
in
united
states
versus
falbo
or
estep
versus
the
united
states.
the
government
--
the
first
part
of
the
government's
brief
treats
our
positions
if
we
are
asking
the
court
to
overrule
falbo
and
estep
and
we
are
not.
secondly,
we
do
not
think
that
the
fact
that
the
petitioner
in
this
case
was
in
the
words
of
the
government's
brief
deliberately
and
flagrantly
avoiding
selective
service
and
refusing
to
have
anything
to
do
with
selective
service
really
has
any
bearing
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
he
had
to
exhaust
his
administrative
remedies.
i
think
the
question
of
whether
or
not
he
had
to
exhaust
his
administrative
remedies
is
questioned
to
be
decided
entirely
apart
from
his
own
particular
attitudes
toward
selective
service.
now,
then
as
to
the
exhaustion
uestion
i
think
first
we
have
to
take
up
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
petitioner
had
to
appeal
his
original
reclassification
and
on
that
question
we
would
--
our
position
is
as
follows,
first
and
foremost,
if
the
classification
or
the
reclassification
on
february
14,
1966
was
based
upon
a
completely
erroneous
interpretation
of
section
456,
we
would
maintain
that
this
was
an
act
beyond
the
jurisdiction
of
local
board
number
9
and
on
that
basis
as
has
been
often
said
in
this
court.
there
is
no
need
to
exhaust;
this
is
an
act
beyond
jurisdiction
of
the
board.
it
is
an
act
totally
prohibited
by
the
statute
and
on
that
basis
we
would
maintain
first
of
all
that
there
was
no
need
for
him
to
appeal.
secondly
and
concomitantly,
we
would
say
that
this
was
a
pure
question
of
law.
that
is
to
say
the
local
boards
both
local
boards
and
the
state
appeal
boards
are
not
competent
to
make
legal
judgments.
i
believe
as
recently
as
the
case
of
oestereich
versus
selective
service
system
number
46
in
this
court,
justice
harlan
very
properly
and
very
incisively
pointed
out
that
the
nature
of
selective
service
boards
are
such
that
they
are
not
equipped
to
deal
with
judicial
questions.
mr.
gorge
c.
pontikes
i
believe
justice
white
that
you
will
find
that
the
appeal
boards
are
made
up
of
the
same
types
of
persons
as
the
local
boards
are
made
up
of.
in
other
words,
if
you
take
local
boards,
then
the
state
appeal
boards
and
finally
the
national
selective
service
board
which
is
made
up
of
three
members.
all
three
boards
do
not
have
persons
who
have
any
judicial
competence.
they
are
not
equipped
to
give
render
any
kind
of
judicial
decisions
whatsoever.
these
are
persons
who
are
uncompensated,
they
hold
no
formal
hearings,
they
require
no
legal
briefs
as
again
as
justice
harlan
pointed
out
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
oestereich
that
no
lawyers
are
allowed.
in
fact,
they
are
specifically
prohibited
by
selective
service
regulation
to
appear
before
the
local
boards.
on
this
basis,
we
would
maintain
that
this
boards
both
cannot
in
fact
make
any
judicial
decisions
and
furthermore
because
they
cannot
they
generally
do
not
and
follow
--
mr.
gorge
c.
pontikes
quite
correct.
mr.
gorge
c.
pontikes
that
is
a
judicial
function,
i
would
agree
and
perhaps
the
word
“judicial”
is
a
little
bit
too
broad
for
our
position.
i
would
say
they
are
not
qualified
to
make
interpretations
of
law,
statutory
constructions
or
constitutional
decisions.
i
would
say
that
those
are
the
types
of
judicial
functions
that
they
are
not
competent
to
engage
--
mr.
gorge
c.
pontikes
oh,
i
would
say
so
your
honor
but
i
think
there,
you
have
an
entirely
different
apparatus.
you
have
for
example
an
adversary
process
which
you
do
not
have
in
selective
service.
the
selective
service
system
is
not
intended
to
be
an
adversary
process
and
the
reason
is
not
intended
to
be
an
adversary
process
is
because
it
is
geared
to
mobilize
manpower
in
a
short
period
of
time.
so,
it
is
not,
it's
simply
is
not
equipped
on
that
basis.
secondly,
as
part
of
the
adversary
process,
you
have
lawyers
appearing
for
both
parties
before
administrative
--
for
a
number
of
parties
before
an
administrative
agency.
you
don't
have
that
in
selective
service.
mr.
gorge
c.
pontikes
well,
i
would
say
that
the
--
what
we
are
saying
is
that
the
act,
the
decision
on
their
part
to
reclassify
in
february
14,
1966
was
an
act
beyond
their
jurisdiction
because
we
contend
that
the
petitioner
was
entitled
to
his
sole
surviving
son
exemption
even
though
his
mother
had
died.
our
contention
is
to
the
statutory
construction
question
justice
harlan
is
that
that
was
a
completely
erroneous
interpretation
of
the
law
and
therefore
that
reclassification
was
an
act
beyond
their
jurisdiction,
that's
our
position.
mr.
gorge
c.
pontikes
that's
correct.
mr.
gorge
c.
pontikes
you
mean
if
the
statute
made
that
requirement?
mr.
gorge
c.
pontikes
i
would
say
that
--
mr.
gorge
c.
pontikes
no,
i'm
not
making
a
constitutional
argument
here
justice
white.
mr.
gorge
c.
pontikes
we
certainly
are
as
to
456
and
we
are
arguing
that
--
mr.
gorge
c.
pontikes
well,
and
but
we
are
further
saying
no
we're
not
saying
--
mr.
gorge
c.
pontikes
no,
i
think
the
decision
in
falbo
was
based
if
i
may
say
on
two
points.
one
was
the
fact
that
in
falbo
if
the
court
will
recall,
nick
falbo
was
seeking
a
4
(d)
classification
as
a
minister
and
this
is
essentially
a
factual
question
within
the
competency
--
mr.
gorge
c.
pontikes
i
would
say
that
it's
a
--
myself
that
it's
a
judicially
imposed
doctrine.
the
selective
service
law
says
that
the
decisions
of
the
boards
of
selective
service
shall
be
final
and
that
was
the
law
up
until
july
1
of
1967
at
which
time
was
added
the
now
section
10
(b)
(3)
which
this
court
had
occasion
to
construe
recently
where
it
said
that
there
will
be
no
review
until
there
has
been
either
--
there's
going
to
response
to
an
order
to
report
for
induction
either
affirmatively
or
negatively
and
then
only
the
review
will
only
encompass
the
question
whether
the
board
had
jurisdiction
as
a
matter
of
basis
and
fact.
but
there
is
no
requirement
to
my
knowledge
within
selective
service
law
that
requires
the
exhaustion.
i
would
say
that
falbo
if
you
will
judicially
impose
the
exhaustion
principle
on
the
grounds
that
--
on
the
general
grounds
applying
to
all
administrative
agencies.
i
don't
think
at
that
point
that
is
as
to
the
appeal
process
they
were
drawing
a
distinction
between
selective
service
and
other
agencies.
mr.
gorge
c.
pontikes
i
don't
think
it
ever
--
in
my
recollection
of
the
reading
of
the
falbo
decision,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that
question
specifically
as
to
the
intent
of
congress
was
ever
raised.
i
do
feel
that
in
falbo
the
primary
motivation
of
the
court
and
a
primary
thinking
of
the
court
was
based
upon
its
conception
of
the
reason
for
selective
service
and
theory
being
that
because
there
was
a
mobilization
that
this
was
a
system
to
mobilize
manpower
that
was
necessary
that
you
require
an
exhaustion
and
further
that
you
require
a
completion
of
the
administrative
process
before
there
could
be
a
defense
raise
in
a
criminal
prosecution.
you
will
recall
justice
white
that
prior
to
falbo
and
estep
the
courts
throughout
the
nation
read
selective
service
as
to
allow
no
defense
whatsoever
to
criminal
prosecutions.
there
was
--
so
that
this
was
a
--
at
that
time,
an
opening
up
of
the
original
statutory
scheme.
now,
our
position
as
to
the
exhaustion
is
based
--
mr.
gorge
c.
pontikes
what
was
thought
to
be
–
correct,
your
honor.
what
was
thought
to
be
the
statutory
scheme,
i
stand
corrected.
our
position
as
to
exhaustion
is
really
based
on
the
fact
that
number
one,
this
is
a
pure
question
of
law
and
coupled
with
the
fact
that
the
appellate
exercise
here
would
be
a
pure
futility.
the
national
director
had
already
indicated
his
construction
of
statute
456.
the
state
director
of
ohio
had
indicated
his
position.
the
local
board
had
adopted
these
positions
and
for
the
petitioner
to
be
required
under
these
circumstances
to
engage
in
these
appeals
would
have
been
pure
futility.
the
government
makes
or
attempts
to
make
the
argument
that
the
state
appeal
board
does
have
the
duty
under
the
requisite
regulations
and
statutes
to
classify
de
novo.
now,
that
is
a
theoretical
duty,
there's
no
question
about
that
but
i
would
say
as
we
said
in
our
reply
brief
that
would
be
a
departure
from
reality
for
the
government
to
contend
that
as
a
practical
matter.
this
occurs
when
the
issue
is
one
of
statutory
construction.
if
for
the
issue
were
one
of
a
factual
determination,
there
might
be
grounds
for
disagreement
between
the
national
director
and
the
appellate
processes
but
where
the
local
board
or
the
state
appeal
board
or
even
the
national
appeal
board
is
faced
with
a
question
of
pure
statutory
construction
was
this
case
involved.
then
there's
no
question
in
my
mind
that
in
99
out
of
a
hundred
cases
they
will
follow
the
national
director.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
this
was
recognized
by
the
court
in
sicurella
versus
the
united
states
where
a
state
appeal
board
had
before
it
a
determination
not
by
the
national
director
but
by
the
justice
department
in
its
conscientious
objector
section,
an
opinion
that
sicurella
was
not
a
conscientious
objector
because
he
was
not
opposed
to
theocratic
war.
and
at
that
time,
the
court
found
that
this
was
an
error
of
law
in
the
determination
by
the
justice
department
and
then
concluded
that
the
appeal
board
probably
followed
this
recommendation
because
there
was
an
authoritative
source
and
thereby
reversed
the
conviction.
certainly,
if
a
state
appeal
board
is
going
to
follow
the
justice
department.
it
will
most
certainly
follow
the
legal
opinions
of
national
director.
mr.
gorge
c.
pontikes
no,
there
is
not.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
theory
of
the
law
justice
marshall
is
--
mr.
gorge
c.
pontikes
there
may
or
may
not
be
lawyers.
mr.
gorge
c.
pontikes
not
as
a
members
necessarily.
mr.
gorge
c.
pontikes
well,
on
some
depending
on
who
in
the
community.
mr.
gorge
c.
pontikes
i
have
absolutely
no
idea.
mr.
gorge
c.
pontikes
well,
i
can't
assume
that
none
--
mr.
gorge
c.
pontikes
i
can't
assume
that
none
of
them
are
justice
marshall.
mr.
gorge
c.
pontikes
i
can
say
however
though
that
on
the
basis
of
the
way
in
which
the
boards
operate
and
on
the
fact
that
they
are
required
by
regulation
statute
to
be
broadly
representative
of
the
entire
community
that
--
mr.
gorge
c.
pontikes
oh,
yes
i
would
very
definitely
say
so.
mr.
gorge
c.
pontikes
that's
correct.
mr.
gorge
c.
pontikes
it
certainly
doesn't
involve.
no.
mr.
gorge
c.
pontikes
pardon
me.
justice
white.
mr.
gorge
c.
pontikes
you
mean
the
in
terms
of
what,
the
appeal?
mr.
gorge
c.
pontikes
by
the
registrant?
mr.
gorge
c.
pontikes
that's
right.
that's
correct.
mr.
gorge
c.
pontikes
no,
he
felt
his
moral
convictions
were
such
that
he
felt
that
he
could
not.
mr.
gorge
c.
pontikes
well,
what
i'm
saying
you
asked
me
the
reason
why
he
didn't
file
his
appeal
and
he
felt
that
this
would
be
cooperating
with
the
system
that
he
felt
was
evil.
mr.
gorge
c.
pontikes
oh,
no
we're
not
saying
that
at
all.
we're
saying
you
do
not
have
to
exhaust
you're
administrative
remedies
because
as
we
have
pointed
out
this
is
a
pure
question
of
law.
the
agency
had
already
made
its
determination
and
there
was
no
question
that
the
appeal
process
would
be
a
futility.
mr.
gorge
c.
pontikes
pardon
me.
mr.
gorge
c.
pontikes
no.
i
would
say
it's
the
reality
of
the
experience
of
the
agencies.
mr.
gorge
c.
pontikes
no.
that's
true.
but
the
fact
decision
is
a
different
matter
as
we
have
pointed
out
and
that's
really
our
--
the
point
at
which
this
case
is
distinguished
from
the
falbo
and
estep
kind
of
rational,
the
doctrines
embodied
in
those
cases.
in
those
cases,
both
of
them,
the
boards
had
to
determine
whether
or
not
a
person
was
a
minister
and
this
is
essentially
a
factual
determination
to
be
made
upon
the
evidence
presented
by
the
individual
registrant.
here,
in
the
case
of
mckart,
the
matter
is
one
of
strictly
one
of
the
interpretation
of
section
456
namely,
was
mckart
to
be
deprived
of
his
4
(a)
exemption
because
he
had
no
family
unit
left
and
we
would
maintain
that
where
that
is
the
issue
and
where
the
agency
in
this
case
selective
service
had
already
made
up
its
mind
that
mckart
was
not
entitled
to
the
exemption
that
for
him
to
be
required
to
go
through
the
appeal's
process
would've
been
a
complete
futility.
now,
we
go
to
the
other
aspect
of
the
government's
position
which
is
that
independent
of
mckart
having
failed
to
exhaust
his
administrative
remedies
he
ought
at
least
to
have
been
required
to
take
physical
examination.
now,
as
to
that
i
call
this
court's
attention
respectfully
to
its
recent
decision
in
oestereich
versus
the
selective
service
system
where
in
a
case
very
similar
to
this
one
the
court
did
not
require
oestereich
to
take
a
physical
examination.
if
the
court
will
read
the
record
carefully
in
the
oestereich
decision
you
will
see
that
there
oestereich
was
not
told
that
before
he
could
obtain
his
remedy
by
way
of
civil
relief
that
he
was
required
to
go
in
and
either
fail
or
pass
a
physical
examination.
now,
as
a
matter
of
fact
as
far
as
we
can
determine
and
i've
read,
checked
the
appendix
in
oestereich,
i
may
able
to
read
the
complete
record
but
as
far
as
i
can
determine
in
the
oestereich
decision
oestereich
never
did
take
physical
examination.
and
i
would
say
that
if
oestereich
is
not
required
to
take
a
physical
examination
as
a
precondition
for
giving
him
civil
relief
then
certainly
i
do
not
think
that
jack
mckart
ought
to
be
required
to
take
a
physical
examination
where
it
would
otherwise
be
futile
for
him
to
exhaust
his
administrative
remedies.
and
that's
the
case
we
had
here.
secondly,
i
think
the
requirement
in
selective
service
law
that
a
physical
examination
be
taken
loses
its
force
in
this
kind
of
case,
i
think
it
has
great
force
in
the
cases
involving
men
like
falbo
and
estep
where
there
are
essentially
factual
determinations
to
be
made
by
the
boards.
there,
i
think
the
court
in
the
interest
of
maintaining
the
speed
and
mobility
of
selective
service
and
in
the
interest
of
not
flooding
the
courts
with
litigation.
there,
there
is
good
reason
for
this
court
to
require
the
taking
of
physical
examination
but
in
the
case
like
mckart's
where
the
issue
is
one
of
statutory
interpretation
i
think
there
is
a
greater
interest
in
having
this
court
determined
the
correct
interpretation
of
the
federal
law.
we're
dealing
here
with
the
interpretation
of
federal
law
and
i
would
say
that
there's
a
greater
interest
in
having
this
court
determine
the
correct
interpretation
of
the
federal
law
and
also
the
fact
because
these
cases
will
occur
less
often.
and
there
is
less
danger
having
the
flood
gates
of
litigation
opened.
i
would
say
finally
on
connection
with
this
point
that
is
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief
an
irony
that
jack
mckart
should
be
ordered
for
a
physical
examination
on
the
basis
of
a
reclassification
that
we
consider
faintly
invalid
because
without
that
reclassification
under
the
existing
selective
service
regulations
he
could
not
be
required
to
take
a
physical
examination.
he
was
not
1
(a)
and
he
was
not
shortly
to
be
inducted
which
are
the
only
two
grounds
upon
which
a
physical
examination
can
be
required.
so,
on
that
basis
it
would
strike
us
as
being
the
most
anomalous
situation
that
he
ought
to
be
barred
from
raising
the
statutory
--
the
incorrect
statutory
interpretation
by
the
fact
that
he
did
not
take
a
physical
examination
which
in
itself
could
not
have
been
required
had
the
reclassification
not
been
made.
i
want
to
reserve
some
time
for
rebuttal.
thank
you
for
your
kind
attention.
mr.
gorge
c.
pontikes
thank
you.
may
it
please
the
court.
i
just
want
to
cover
some
of
the
matters
that
were
raised
by
the
government.
again,
i
must
insist
to
the
court
that
we
are
not
seeking
to
overrule
the
position
taken
by
this
court
in
falbo
and
estep.
it
seems
to
us
fundamental
that
there
is
a
crucial
distinction
to
be
drawn
between
the
falbo-estep
situation
where
a
local
board
makes
certain
factual
determinations
comes
to
conclusion
and
then
there
is
a
requirement
that
there
will
be
an
exhaustion
and
the
taking
away
physical.
now,
in
that
particular
case,
you
do
not
have
a
pure
statutory
question
of
pure
statutory
construction
that
you
have
in
this
case.
there's
no
factual
dispute
in
this
case
whatsoever.
there
is
no
fact
--
factual
decision
that
the
system
had
to
make
at
all.
it
was
a
pure
question
of
law.
further,
as
the
courts
have
recognized
where
an
administrative
process
or
the
taking
of
administrative
appeals
would
be
futile
then
the
aggrieved
party
is
not
required
to
take
those
administrative
processes.
now,
for
the
government
to
tell
us
here
that
the
state
appeal
board
is
going
to
operate
independently
of
the
directions
of
the
national
director
is
really
to
find
the
face
of
reality.
i
call
your
attention
your
attention
to
the
wolf
case
specifically
in
wolf
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals
found
that
the
national
as
you
recall
in
that
case
the
registrants
who
filed
the
suit
asking
for
preinduction
relief
had
not
exhausted
any
administrative
remedies
whatsoever.
they
have
been
reclassified
by
their
local
boards
and
thereupon
when
and
asking
for
a
declaratory
judgment
to
declare
that
their
classifications
were
invalid
and
based
upon
unconstitutional
considerations.
in
wolf,
the
court
found
that
the
national
director
had
clearly
stated
his
position
and
they
found
other
conditions
to
indicate
that
the
system
had
already
made
up
its
mind
and
we
would
say
the
same
conditions
apply
here.
the
system
had
made
up
its
mind
and
for
the
government
to
tell
us
now
--
mr.
gorge
c.
pontikes
correct.
very
much
so
justice
stewart.
there
was
--
i
would
say
that
the
possibilities
of
a
state
appeal
board
overturning
or
flying
in
the
face
of
this
construction
of
the
statute
would
be
if
not
impossible
certainly
practically
impossible.
secondly,
i
would
point
as
far
as
the
case
reaching
the
national
selective
service
appeal
board,
i
would
point
out
to
the
court
that
by
the
statistics
of
the
government
itself
there
were
only
479
split
decisions
heard
by
the
national
selective
service
appeal
board.
the
split
decision
is
a
decision
where
there's
a
dissent
on
state
appeal
board.
this
is
in
the
first
six
months
of
1968.
in
fiscal
1967,
the
state
appeal
boards
heard
119,167
cases.
so,
if
you
take
those
two
figures
and
put
them
together
you'll
get
an
idea
of
how
possible
it
is
first
of
all
for
this
case
ever
to
have
reached
the
national
appeal
board.
secondly,
even
though
the
cases
indicates
some
disagreement
with
the
national
state
director,
there's
no
showing
that
the
cases
decided
by
the
national
board
were
decided
on
questions
of
legal
interpretation
of
the
statute.
we
would
rather
assume
that
there
were
questions
and
which
facts
--
they
were
factual
determinations
made
in
disagreement
with
the
national
director
and
the
state
director.
mr.
gorge
c.
pontikes
well,
that's
the
point
i
made
at
the
outset
justice
harlan.
mr.
gorge
c.
pontikes
i
would,
i
think
--
mr.
gorge
c.
pontikes
i
don't
think
the
fact
that
the
petitioner
dislike
selective
service
and
therefore
or
had
more
convictions
about
its
operations
and
felt
compelled
not
to
cooperate
with
it
but
that
fact
has
any
bearing
whether
he
had
to
exhaust
his
administrative
remedies
because
it
seems
to
me
that
the
question
of
exhaustion
is
depended
on
issues
that
are
wholly
unrelated
to
his
particular
attitude.
furthermore
as
far
as
forcing
some
kind
of
compliance
by
not
upholding
the
petitioner's
position
to
this
case.
petitioner
was
not
reading
supreme
court
decision.
his
decision
not
to
cooperate
was
based
wholly
upon
his
own
moral
considerations.
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
what
might
happen
to
him.
so,
that's
the
reason
i
don't
think
the
two
are
related
at
all
in
any
sense
either
practically
illegally.
now,
briefly
to
cover
this
question
of
the
grandparents
--
mr.
gorge
c.
pontikes
oh,
i
think
there
we
have
the
pickens
versus
cox
situation.
mr.
gorge
c.
pontikes
which
is
a
sole
surviving
son
drafted
into
the
army
without
giving
any
information
to
his
board
whatsoever
and
thereupon
after
court
martial
seeking
by
way
of
habeas
corpus
to
be
released
on
the
grounds
that
there
was
no
jurisdiction
that
taken
to
the
army
the
first
place
and
there,
the
pickens
court
quietly
held
that
under
those
circumstances
he
had
waived
his
right.
i
point
out
to
the
court
here
--
mr.
gorge
c.
pontikes
well,
i
think
there
wouldn't
be
a
question
so
much
of
exhaustion
but
on
the
fact
that
he
had
complete
waived
his
right
to
even
claim
that
exemption
because
he
had
not
supplied
the
information
at
all.
mr.
gorge
c.
pontikes
well,
i
would
say
no
for
the
following
reasons.
when
he
was
asked
to
supply
this
information
he
did
not
feel
that
this
was
a
violation
of
his
moral
principles.
so,
he
did
supply
the
information.
if
you
will
look
--
i
don't
have
the
exhibit
number
handy
but
you
will
note
when
he
was
asked
simply
specific
questionnaire
asking
for
the
name
of
his
father,
the
date
of
death
and
other
relevant
information
all
of
this
he
readily
supplied
because
he
felt
this
was
not
a
form
of
cooperation
--
i
see
the
red
light
is
flashing
--
a
form
of
cooperation
which
violate
his
moral
position.
so,
on
that
sense
he
did
not
waive
it
and
therefore
i
don't
think
the
issue
is
the
case
here.
mr.
gorge
c.
pontikes
certainly
not
but
we
say
--
this
court
faced
that
same
position
in
oestereich
justice
marshall
and
there
they
did
not
require
oestereich
(voice
overlap).
mr.
gorge
c.
pontikes
no.
thank
you
my
time
is
over.
thank
you.
