mr.
robert
j.
haft
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
matter
is
before
the
court
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
the
fifth
circuit,
involves
two
offenses
relating
to
the
possession
of
one-half
ounce
of
marihuana.
the
first
defense
was
a
conviction
under
the
marihuana
tax
act
and
the
second
was
a
conviction
under
the
importation
statute,
section
176a
of
title
21.
the
two
questions
presented
to
the
court
are
first,
the
--
whether
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
is
a
defense
to
a
prosecution
under
the
marihuana
tax
act,
and
the
second
question
is
the
constitutionality
under
the
due
process
clause
of
the
presumption
in
the
importation
statutes
which
presumes
importation
in
fact
of
marihuana
and
knowledge
in
fact
by
the
defendant
of
such
illegal
importation.
both
inferences
flowing
from
mere
possession
alone
are
facts
in
the
case
are
quite
simple.
the
petitioner
had
an
automobile
trip
from
new
york
to
laredo,
texas,
tried
to
enter
mexico,
was
denied
entry,
came
back
to
laredo
and
was
search
thoroughly
at
customs
and
the
less
than
a
half
an
ounce
was
found.
at
the
trial,
petitioner
took
the
stand
and
admitted
acquisition
of
the
marihuana
in
new
york.
on
the
first
issue,
that
is
whether
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
is
available
as
a
defense
to
a
marihuana
tax
act
prosecution.
i
think
the
court's
language
in
the
grosso
case
is
particularly
at,
that
is
at
the
hazards
of
incrimination
ought
to
be
measured
by
literal
and
full
compliance
with
all
the
statutory
requirements.
the
government
has
no
argument
on
that
test.
they
simply
say
that
literal
and
full
compliance
with
the
statute
is
quite
simple.
a
proposed
illegal
possessor
of
marihuana
can
not
pay,
prepay
the
marihuana
tax,
cannot
obtain
an
order
form
from
the
secretary
or
the
treasury,
and
therefore
is
absolutely
prohibited
from
obtaining
marihuana
and
hence
argues
the
government.
there
were
no
hazards
of
incrimination
under
the
statute.
you
just
cannot
acquire
marihuana.
our
petitioner's
position
is
that
the
plain
meaning
of
the
act,
the
legislative
history
of
the
act
and
in
fact
the
government's
position
in
a
case
before
this
court
are
completely
contrary.
a
brief
review
i
think
of
the
statutory
scheme
will
be
helpful.
the
order
form
requirement
under
the
marihuana
tax
act
states
that
a
written
order
form
must
be
obtained
prior
to
any
transfer
of
marihuana.
there
are
no
significant
exceptions.
the
tax
is
imposed
on
all
transfers
required
to
be
accompanied
by
a
written
order
form,
and
of
course
all
must
be
accompanied
by
such
an
order
form.
the
tax
is
a
very
interesting
one,
it
is
a
dollar
an
ounce
on
registered
transferees,
that
is
persons
whose
activities
in
relation
to
marihuana
are
lawful
and
who
have
registered
and
paid
the
special
occupational
tax.
and
in
the
case
of
all
others
to
with
unregistered
persons,
persons
whose
possession
is
likely
to
be
unlawful,
the
tax
is
$100.00
per
ounce.
there
are
very
clear
schemes
for
statutory
disclosure
under
the
marihuana
tax
act.
the
written
order
form,
a
duplicate
must
be
preserved
in
the
internal
revenue
district
for
two
years.
it's
available
to
federal
state
and
local
prosecutors
and
admissible
in
evidence.
now,
against
this
very
clear
statutory
scheme
compelling
incrimination,
it
seems
to
me
we
have
to
deal
with
the
government's
position.
government's
position
is
that
they
have
had
a
policy
since
the
passage
of
the
marihuana
tax
act
in
1937
of
construing
that
act
in
pari
materia
with
the
1914
harrison
anti-narcotic
act.
under
the
harrison
act,
it
expressly
states
that
only
registered
persons,
persons
who
have
paid
the
occupational
tax
can
obtain
an
order
form.
it's
expressly
in
the
statute.
the
marihuana
tax
act
on
the
other
hand
clearly
states
the
contrary.
it
says
that
every
person
whether
or
not
registered
and
whether
or
not
you've
paid
the
special
tax
must
obtain
an
order
form
prior
to
the
acquisition
of
marihuana.
mr.
robert
j.
haft
under
the
harrison
act,
it
is
a
crime
as
well.
mr.
robert
j.
haft
yes,
there
is
a
tax.
mr.
robert
j.
haft
no,
but
i
think
that
the
pattern
is
very
clear
here
under
the
harrison
act
since
it
permits
only
lawful
transfers,
the
tax
is
very
low,
its
one
cent
per
ounce
because
it
contemplates
only
legal
transfers.
mr.
robert
j.
haft
no,
it
is
one
cent
because
everything
under
that
act
is
only
legal
under
the
marihuana
tax
act,
this
is
a
very
clear
distinction
that
dollar
an
ounce
for
legal
transactions
and
a
$100.00
an
ounce
for
illegal
ones
for
transfer
permitted
in
a
$100.00
an
ounce
case.
mr.
robert
j.
haft
nobody
is
ever
paid.
mr.
robert
j.
haft
that's
right.
oh,
has
been
severely
--
mr.
robert
j.
haft
mr.
justice
white,
yes,
they
have
been.
in
fact
united
states
--
mr.
robert
j.
haft
they
have
a
civil
liability
to
pay
it
and
there
have
been
actually
civil
proceedings
independent
of
criminal
proceedings,
and
i
think
united
states
against
sanchez
before
this
court
raised
that
question.
the
legislative
history
if
the
plain
meaning
were
not
enough,
a
legislative
history
of
the
marihuana
tax
act
clears
this
point;
very
clearly
that
everybody
was
intended
under
that
act
to
be
able
to
receive
marihuana
under
a
transfer,
under
an
order
form.
clinton
m.
hester,
who
was
assistant
general
counsel
to
the
treasury,
testified
before
both
the
house
and
senate
committees
in
1937
with
reference
to
the
tax
act.
he
said
that
this
act
is
different
than
the
harrison
act.
under
the
harrison
act,
only
legal
persons
in
licit
transactions
can
obtain
harrison
narcotics,
but
under
this
act,
the
marihuana
tax
act,
anyone
can
get
marihuana
just
as
under
the
national
firearms
act,
and
the
analogy
was
bought
out
by
the
treasury
sponsor.
just
like
under
the
national
firearms
act,
this
act,
the
marihuana
tax
act
which
permit
transfer
of
marihuana
to
anyone
but
of
course
upon
the
payment
of
a
heavy
tax
as
in
the
national
firearms
act,
by
golly,
anybody
could
get
a
submachine
gun.
and
in
--
in
that
very
same
legislative
history,
clinton
hester
stated
and
he
spelled
out
exactly.
he
said,
a
person
who
wants
marihuana
will
go
to
the
collect,
pay
his
$100.00,
fill
out
the
order
form
and
give
that
to
the
transferor
as
the
transferee
would
do
that.
the
government
itself
totally
inconsistent
with
his
new
argument,
i
think
highly
imaginative
one
in
order
to
meet
the
haynes,
grosso,
and
marchetti
cases,
completely
inconsistent
with
this.
in
united
states
against
sanchez
before
this
court
in
their
brief,
the
government
said
that
the
marihuana
tax
act
does
not
constitute
a
complete
prohibition
upon
acquisition
of
marihuana
by
unregistered
persons.
that
instead
of
doing
that,
congress
shows
to
levy
a
$100.00
per
ounce
tax.
i
submit
that
the
regulations
under
the
statute
do
not
change
the
result.
the
regulation
specifically
provide
in
the
case
of
the
order
form
that
if
the
transferee
is
registered,
it
says
if
registered,
put
down
your
registration
number,
thereby
clearly
contemplating
that
persons
not
registered
could
obtain
the
order
form.
now,
i
think
that
the
hazard
of
incrimination
under
my
interpretation
which
i
think
is
the
clearest
statutory
plain
meaning
of
act
plus
the
legislative
history.
i
think
the
hazards
are
very
clear.
congress
has
created
a
special
category,
it's
a
clear
red
light,
$100.00
an
ounce,
we
specially
reserve
that
for
illicit
transactions.
and
by
the
way,
the
legislative
history
makes
that
clear.
it
said
it
in
the
house
report
say
the
$100.00
is
for
illicit
transactions.
now,
you're
going
to
have
a
possessor
whose
possession
is
unlawful
under
virtually
the
laws
of
every
state.
go
to
the
secretary
of
the
treasury,
tender
a
$100.00
an
ounce
tax,
fill-out
an
order
form
which
asks
for
his
name,
his
address,
the
quantities
he
proposes
to
get,
and
who
is
going
to
transfer
it
to
him.
i
submit
that
that
is
submitting
the
jail
key
at
the
time
and
i
think
it's
clear
the
hazards
are
blatant.
now,
the
government
i
think
also
in
recognition
of
the
clear
force
of
this
argument
has
said
in
many
places
in
their
brief,
well,
the
petitioner
is
some
sort
of
fellow
who
is
on
psychedelic
cloud
number
9,
who
really
doesn't
care
about
this
fifth
amendment
privilege.
he
knew
about
our
policy.
he
knew
about
this
complete
prohibition
and
he
never
cared
in
this
matter
or
gave
no
concern
to
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
in
connection
with
his
failure
to
apply
for
the
tax,
to
pay
the
tax.
now,
in
the
testimony,
in
the
appendix,
pages
86,
87,
and
89,
i
think
the
testimony
completely
contradicts
that
position.
question
now,
“why
didn't
you
pay
the
transfer
tax
in
this
instance
on
the
marihuana
which
you
had?”
answer,
“well,
i
knew
that
i
couldn't
get
such
a
permission.
i
also
knew
that
if
i
had
applied
for
such
a
stamp,
i
would
probably
subject
myself
to
investigation.”
now,
as
i
read
the
next
excerpt,
i
think
it's
clear
that
permission
in
this
context,
the
petitioner
meant
applying
for
registration
which
is
as
very
clear
as
applicable
only
to
lawful
possessors,
there's
no
difference
between
the
government
and
petitioner
on
that.
question,
“do
you
the
tax
on
marihuana,
the
special
tax
on
marihuana?”
answer,
“its
my
understanding
that
for
one
dollar
or
three
dollars,
you
can
buy
some
sort
of
permit.”
and
that
is
by
the
way
the
amount
of
the
occupational
tax,
a
dollar
in
one
case
and
three
in
another.
and
that
--
and
if
you
have
marihuana
and
don't
have
a
permit,
it's
a
dollar
an
ounce.
question,
“wwhy
didn't
you
pay
that?”
answer,
“i
was
very
certain
that
i
would
not
be
able
to
pay
the
tax
on
the
marihuana
and
not
--
not
only
would
it
be
taken
away
from
me
but
i
would
be
subjected
to
action.”
question,
“did
you
or
did
you
not
have
an
honest
belief
that
you
could
not
obtain
the
permit
for
marihuana?”
answer,
"yes,
sir.
i
had
a
strong
and
honest
belief
that
i
could
not
get
it
and
that
it
would
cause
a
lot
of
publicity
and
trouble
for
both
the
government
and
myself.”
i
think
the
--
mr.
robert
j.
haft
no,
the
case
was
tried
before.
the
verdict
was
handed
down
by
the
jury
before
marchetti,
haynes
and
grosso
and
about
10
days
before
the
court
granted
certiorari
in
the
costello
case
which
first
gave
a
hint
that
this
issue
would
come
before
the
court.
the
last
point
on
the
self-incrimination
issue,
we
believe
that
if
we're
right
on
this
point
that
you
must
reverse
on
the
importation
count
as
well,
whether
we're
correct
or
not
on
the
presumption
point,
but
that
count
has
to
be
reversed
also
because
of
the
trial
judge's
instructions
in
this
case.
on
the
presumption
issue,
he
charged
the
statutory
presumption
that
the
jury
may
convict
unless
the
defendant
explains
the
satisfaction
--
his
possession
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
jury.
the
judge
then
added
to
that,
he
said,
“by
that
i
mean
unless
the
defendant
explains
that
his
possession
was
a
lawful
and
legitimate
possession,
immediately
thereafter,
the
trial
judge
charged
that
a
failure
to
pay
the
tax,
the
marihuana
tax,
the
failure
to
produce
the
order
form
on
demand
rendered
the
transaction
illegitimate.
so
that
the
jury
was
in
a
clear
position,
in
fact
was
suggesting
that
they
find
the
possession
illegitimate
on
the
importation
count
based
on
the
failure
to
pay
the
tax
or
produce
the
order
form.
the
second
issue
before
the
court
is
the
validity
of
statutory
presumption
in
176a
under
the
due
process
clause.
now,
the
statute
itself,
176a
is
a
very
narrow
crime
that's
defined.
it
is
that
whoever
knowingly
with
intent
to
defraud
the
united
states
in
any
manner
facilitates
the
transportation
of
marihuana
after
the
same
has
been
imported
and
knowing
that
the
marihuana
has
been
imported
is
guilty
of
a
crime.
mr.
robert
j.
haft
yes,
i
believe
that's
what
the
intent
to
defraud
the
united
states
means
because
another
part
of
the
statute
says
marihuana
which
should
have
been
invoiced,
meaning
that
it
should
have
import
duly
or
levy
should
have
been
placed
on
it
at
the
time
of
importation.
now,
these
narrow
statutory
elements
are
swept
away
by
the
presumption
which
just
says
that
mere
possession
is
presumptive
evidence
of
guilt
unless
the
defendant
explains
his
possession
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
jury.
now,
it's
our
position
that
that
presumption
is
not
rational,
it
does
not
comport
with
common
experience.
the
issue
was
raised
at
the
trial
by
evidence
which
was
introduced
showing
that
marihuana
grew
in
the
united
states,
grew
any
place
in
the
united
states,
and
offer
was
made
to
show
the
amount
of
marihuana
grown
domestically
and
the
proportions
of
marihuana
grow
domestically
as
against
importer,
that
offer
was
rejected
by
the
trial
court.
now,
my
position
is
that
whether
marihuana
is
imported
in
fact
is
an
arguable
proposition
but
that
whether
the
defendant
in
fact
knew
of
the
illegal
importation,
the
presumption
that
he
in
fact
knew
in
any
particular
case
is
an
irrational
presumption
and
that
in
either
of
that
applying
the
standard
of
reasonable
doubt
as
is
required
in
a
criminal
case
at
best
in
arguably
rational
proposition
is
one
that
ought
to
be
condemned
by
this
court.
in
the
reply
brief
in
this
matter,
a
--
i
cite
a
case
entitle
the
united
states
against
adams
which
was
decided
subsequent
to
the
submission
of
the
government's
brief
in
this
case.
in
united
states
against
adams,
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
new
york
made
various
findings
which
i
think
are
important
here.
i
think
that
the
legal
rationale
of
that
case
is
something
that
of
course
is
before
this
court
and
there's
no
sense
citing
another
precedent
on
that.
i
think
the
findings
are
important.
the
court
held
an
evidentiary
hearing
and
made
the
following
findings.
one,
that
marihuana
is
a
plant
which
grows
extensively
on
a
wild
basis
without
fertilization.
it
also
a
plant
that
is
easily
cultivated
and
is
very
hardy
in
its
growth
that
is
impossible
to
determine
whether
any
quantity
of
marihuana
is
imported
or
is
domestic
and
that
is
on
scientific
investigation
of
the
particular
quantity,
its
virtually
impossible.
most
importantly,
the
judge
found
that
common
experience
if
anything
tends
to
suggest
that
most
people
if
not
all
are
under
the
belief
that
marihuana
is
grown
domestically
and
that
that
explains
its
wide
spread
domestic
use.
in
this
regard,
the
judge
relied
upon
what
he
considered
the
stuff
of
common
experience,
the
everyday
newspaper
plus
with
federal
and
state
enforcement
officials
themselves
are
saying
about
this
problem.
and
the
strongest
argument
it
seems
to
me
on
the
extensiveness
of
the
domestic
growth
and
the
judge
found
it
was
very
very
substantial,
was
it
year
after
year,
the
enforcement
and
officials
point
out
that
this
is
a
vital
problem,
a
prevalent
problem
and
they
proudly
report
the
vast
acreage
destroyed
in
the
united
states.
and
the
very
next
year
the
bureau
of
narcotics
reports
another
vast
amount
of
acreage
that
they've
found
that
next
year
leading
to
the
inference
it
seems
to
me
that
there's
a
substantial
amount
that
is
not
discovered
each
year
and
which
does
form
the
source
of
supply
for
domestic
--
domestically
used
marihuana.
the
judge
referred
to
his
reading
of
the
everyday
newspaper
and
he
said
in
one
not
unsensational
newspaper
he
found
five
accounts
in
three
months
that
unsensational
newspaper
was
the
new
york
times,
and
one
of
the
article
that
he
cited
was
on
page
one
of
the
new
york
times,
on
august
21,
1968,
it
cited
in
his
opinion.
in
that
case,
in
jersey,
near
hoboken
in
jersey
city,
the
state
officials
had
found
an
area
of
meadow
lands
that
had
20,000
marihuana
plants
which
they
proceeded
to
destroy.
that
one
growth
was
enough
to
supply
one
cigarette
to
every
one
of
the
17
million
high
schools
students
in
the
country,
that
one
area.
in
some
areas,
marihuana
is
so
thick
that
a
truck
load
can
be
gathered
very
quickly.
plants,
some
as
high
as
10
feet
grow
along
the
susquehanna
railroad
tracks,
the
parallel
route
one
along
the
north
bergin
segment
of
the
meadow.
now,
this
is
a
problem
which
was
not
really
before
congress
at
the
time
in
1956
that
they
passed
the
presumption.
at
that
time,
they
had
commissioner
anslinger's
testimony
that
90%
of
seizures
in
the
united
state
came
from
mexico.
the
other
testimony
was
of
texas
and
border
enforcement
officials,
which
is
by
no
means
representative
of
the
experience
in
the
country.
taking
just
the
acreage
destroyed
by
the
bureau
of
narcotics
in
1965,
the
last
figure
that
the
bureau
itself
reported
which
is
on
page
17
of
their
annual
report
for
that
year,
there
were
1,900
acres
destroyed.
using
the
bureau's
own
estimate
of
yield
and
the
estimate
of
the
number
of
cigarettes
per
pound
from
the
article
i
read
to
you,
the
1965
seizures
alone,
destruction
of
acreage.
if
it
had
been
committed
to
yield
would
have
produced
2
billion
marihuana
cigarettes
or
10th
to
every
person
in
the
united
states.
marihuana
does
pass
from
many
hands
from
the
source
to
the
smoker,
and
i
think
that's
important
to
attesting
whether
or
not
a
defendant
should
he
held
to
know
or
could
know
the
basic
source
because
this
is
the
kind
of
thing
which
is
transferred
often.
another
function
--
mr.
robert
j.
haft
i
said
that
marihuana
in
the
traffic
passes
from
many
hands
from
the
original
source
or
the
grower
to
the
smoker.
there
maybe
20
or
30
middleman
in
the
transaction
and
telling
the
defendant
another
one
who's
caught
at
possession,
now
it's
up
to
you
to
explain
this
or
that
you
should
know
it's
rational
to
presume
that
you
knew
whether
it
was
imported
or
domestic,
i
say
it's
irrational.
i
say
that
because
this
is
a
criminal
presumption
that
were
talking
about
applicable
at
a
criminal
case,
the
standard
reasonable
doubt
are
oath
to
apply
here
and
that
you
are
telling
the
jury
when
you
permit
this
kind
of
presumption
that
this
probability
that
the
defendant
knew
that
a
given
quantity
of
marihuana
was
imported,
we're
telling
the
jury
when
we
use
that
presumption
that
the
probability
is
far
and
excess
of
50/50
that
the
defendant
knew
--
mr.
robert
j.
haft
i
support
it.
mr.
robert
j.
haft
yes,
i
do.
i
do
but
--
mr.
robert
j.
haft
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
do
agree
with
that.
i
do
agree
also
with
the
point
he
makes
that
this
kind
of
a
presumption
creates
a
very
unfair
situation
because
if
defendant
is
in
a
position
where
it's
impossible
for
him
to
defend
because
he
can't
defend
on
the
lack
of
knowledge
of
importation.
he
can't
go
back
and
try
and
prove
the
source
of
this
through
this
long
chain
of
title.
now,
its
quite
different
from
the
illegal
still
case
where
a
defendant
ought
to
be
in
a
position,
explain
why
he
is
20
feet
way
out
in
some
place,
its
dark,
why
is
he
there
that
night?
that
he
can
explain
but
he
can't
explain.
he
can't
prove.
he
doesn't
have
the
ability
to
prove
whether
that
marihuana
was
in
fact
imported.
mr.
robert
j.
haft
yes,
there
is
because
the
judge,
the
trial
judge
withdrew
the
first
count
which
was
a
smuggling
count
--
mr.
robert
j.
haft
on
the
theory
that
there
could
not
be
a
smuggling
into
or
importation
into
the
united
states
on
these
facts
because
he
had
admitted
acquisition
of
it
in
new
york,
had
practically
not
crossed
into
mexico,
it's
only
international.
mr.
robert
j.
haft
he
also
have
the
entire
issues
of
fact
on
whether
he
knew
on
the
way
back
over
the
bridge
whether
the
marihuana
had
been
thrown
out
of
the
car
or
not.
mr.
robert
j.
haft
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
stewart
but
--
mr.
robert
j.
haft
there
were
issues
raised
because
his
daughter
had
had
the
marihuana.
he
told
her
to
get
rid
of
it.
as
they
were
over
the
bridge
practically
at
the
custom
station,
she
told
him
she
hadn't.
the
whole
question
of
the
opportunity
to
stop
then
was
raised.
but
the
point
i
think
here
was
--
mr.
robert
j.
haft
yes,
i
--
mr.
robert
j.
haft
exactly.
mr.
robert
j.
haft
exactly.
the
government
in
their
brief
says,
“well,
there
is
this
alternative
theory.”
now,
there's
no
question
that
the
guilt
--
evidence
of
guilt
is
overwhelming
on
the
trip
to
mexico
back
to
texas
if
the
jury
so
believe.
but
because
of
the
use
of
the
unconstitutional
presumption
here
on
the
side
that
is
new
york
down
to
texas
coupled
with
a
statutory
presumption,
we
rely
on
the
romano
case
in
which
this
court
said
that
despite
overwhelming
evidence
of
guilt,
if
an
unconstitutional
presumption
is
in
a
case
and
we
can't
speculate
how
the
jury
found
whether
they
used
it
or
not,
we
are
going
to
reverse
the
case.
thank
you.
mr.
robert
j.
haft
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
matter
is
before
the
court
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
the
fifth
circuit,
involves
two
offenses
relating
to
the
possession
of
one-half
ounce
of
marihuana.
the
first
defense
was
a
conviction
under
the
marihuana
tax
act
and
the
second
was
a
conviction
under
the
importation
statute,
section
176a
of
title
21.
the
two
questions
presented
to
the
court
are
first,
the
--
whether
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
is
a
defense
to
a
prosecution
under
the
marihuana
tax
act,
and
the
second
question
is
the
constitutionality
under
the
due
process
clause
of
the
presumption
in
the
importation
statutes
which
presumes
importation
in
fact
of
marihuana
and
knowledge
in
fact
by
the
defendant
of
such
illegal
importation.
both
inferences
flowing
from
mere
possession
alone
are
facts
in
the
case
are
quite
simple.
the
petitioner
had
an
automobile
trip
from
new
york
to
laredo,
texas,
tried
to
enter
mexico,
was
denied
entry,
came
back
to
laredo
and
was
search
thoroughly
at
customs
and
the
less
than
a
half
an
ounce
was
found.
at
the
trial,
petitioner
took
the
stand
and
admitted
acquisition
of
the
marihuana
in
new
york.
on
the
first
issue,
that
is
whether
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
is
available
as
a
defense
to
a
marihuana
tax
act
prosecution.
i
think
the
court's
language
in
the
grosso
case
is
particularly
at,
that
is
at
the
hazards
of
incrimination
ought
to
be
measured
by
literal
and
full
compliance
with
all
the
statutory
requirements.
the
government
has
no
argument
on
that
test.
they
simply
say
that
literal
and
full
compliance
with
the
statute
is
quite
simple.
a
proposed
illegal
possessor
of
marihuana
can
not
pay,
prepay
the
marihuana
tax,
cannot
obtain
an
order
form
from
the
secretary
or
the
treasury,
and
therefore
is
absolutely
prohibited
from
obtaining
marihuana
and
hence
argues
the
government.
there
were
no
hazards
of
incrimination
under
the
statute.
you
just
cannot
acquire
marihuana.
our
petitioner's
position
is
that
the
plain
meaning
of
the
act,
the
legislative
history
of
the
act
and
in
fact
the
government's
position
in
a
case
before
this
court
are
completely
contrary.
a
brief
review
i
think
of
the
statutory
scheme
will
be
helpful.
the
order
form
requirement
under
the
marihuana
tax
act
states
that
a
written
order
form
must
be
obtained
prior
to
any
transfer
of
marihuana.
there
are
no
significant
exceptions.
the
tax
is
imposed
on
all
transfers
required
to
be
accompanied
by
a
written
order
form,
and
of
course
all
must
be
accompanied
by
such
an
order
form.
the
tax
is
a
very
interesting
one,
it
is
a
dollar
an
ounce
on
registered
transferees,
that
is
persons
whose
activities
in
relation
to
marihuana
are
lawful
and
who
have
registered
and
paid
the
special
occupational
tax.
and
in
the
case
of
all
others
to
with
unregistered
persons,
persons
whose
possession
is
likely
to
be
unlawful,
the
tax
is
$100.00
per
ounce.
there
are
very
clear
schemes
for
statutory
disclosure
under
the
marihuana
tax
act.
the
written
order
form,
a
duplicate
must
be
preserved
in
the
internal
revenue
district
for
two
years.
it's
available
to
federal
state
and
local
prosecutors
and
admissible
in
evidence.
now,
against
this
very
clear
statutory
scheme
compelling
incrimination,
it
seems
to
me
we
have
to
deal
with
the
government's
position.
government's
position
is
that
they
have
had
a
policy
since
the
passage
of
the
marihuana
tax
act
in
1937
of
construing
that
act
in
pari
materia
with
the
1914
harrison
anti-narcotic
act.
under
the
harrison
act,
it
expressly
states
that
only
registered
persons,
persons
who
have
paid
the
occupational
tax
can
obtain
an
order
form.
it's
expressly
in
the
statute.
the
marihuana
tax
act
on
the
other
hand
clearly
states
the
contrary.
it
says
that
every
person
whether
or
not
registered
and
whether
or
not
you've
paid
the
special
tax
must
obtain
an
order
form
prior
to
the
acquisition
of
marihuana.
mr.
robert
j.
haft
under
the
harrison
act,
it
is
a
crime
as
well.
mr.
robert
j.
haft
yes,
there
is
a
tax.
mr.
robert
j.
haft
no,
but
i
think
that
the
pattern
is
very
clear
here
under
the
harrison
act
since
it
permits
only
lawful
transfers,
the
tax
is
very
low,
its
one
cent
per
ounce
because
it
contemplates
only
legal
transfers.
mr.
robert
j.
haft
no,
it
is
one
cent
because
everything
under
that
act
is
only
legal
under
the
marihuana
tax
act,
this
is
a
very
clear
distinction
that
dollar
an
ounce
for
legal
transactions
and
a
$100.00
an
ounce
for
illegal
ones
for
transfer
permitted
in
a
$100.00
an
ounce
case.
mr.
robert
j.
haft
nobody
is
ever
paid.
mr.
robert
j.
haft
that's
right.
oh,
has
been
severely
--
mr.
robert
j.
haft
mr.
justice
white,
yes,
they
have
been.
in
fact
united
states
--
mr.
robert
j.
haft
they
have
a
civil
liability
to
pay
it
and
there
have
been
actually
civil
proceedings
independent
of
criminal
proceedings,
and
i
think
united
states
against
sanchez
before
this
court
raised
that
question.
the
legislative
history
if
the
plain
meaning
were
not
enough,
a
legislative
history
of
the
marihuana
tax
act
clears
this
point;
very
clearly
that
everybody
was
intended
under
that
act
to
be
able
to
receive
marihuana
under
a
transfer,
under
an
order
form.
clinton
m.
hester,
who
was
assistant
general
counsel
to
the
treasury,
testified
before
both
the
house
and
senate
committees
in
1937
with
reference
to
the
tax
act.
he
said
that
this
act
is
different
than
the
harrison
act.
under
the
harrison
act,
only
legal
persons
in
licit
transactions
can
obtain
harrison
narcotics,
but
under
this
act,
the
marihuana
tax
act,
anyone
can
get
marihuana
just
as
under
the
national
firearms
act,
and
the
analogy
was
bought
out
by
the
treasury
sponsor.
just
like
under
the
national
firearms
act,
this
act,
the
marihuana
tax
act
which
permit
transfer
of
marihuana
to
anyone
but
of
course
upon
the
payment
of
a
heavy
tax
as
in
the
national
firearms
act,
by
golly,
anybody
could
get
a
submachine
gun.
and
in
--
in
that
very
same
legislative
history,
clinton
hester
stated
and
he
spelled
out
exactly.
he
said,
a
person
who
wants
marihuana
will
go
to
the
collect,
pay
his
$100.00,
fill
out
the
order
form
and
give
that
to
the
transferor
as
the
transferee
would
do
that.
the
government
itself
totally
inconsistent
with
his
new
argument,
i
think
highly
imaginative
one
in
order
to
meet
the
haynes,
grosso,
and
marchetti
cases,
completely
inconsistent
with
this.
in
united
states
against
sanchez
before
this
court
in
their
brief,
the
government
said
that
the
marihuana
tax
act
does
not
constitute
a
complete
prohibition
upon
acquisition
of
marihuana
by
unregistered
persons.
that
instead
of
doing
that,
congress
shows
to
levy
a
$100.00
per
ounce
tax.
i
submit
that
the
regulations
under
the
statute
do
not
change
the
result.
the
regulation
specifically
provide
in
the
case
of
the
order
form
that
if
the
transferee
is
registered,
it
says
if
registered,
put
down
your
registration
number,
thereby
clearly
contemplating
that
persons
not
registered
could
obtain
the
order
form.
now,
i
think
that
the
hazard
of
incrimination
under
my
interpretation
which
i
think
is
the
clearest
statutory
plain
meaning
of
act
plus
the
legislative
history.
i
think
the
hazards
are
very
clear.
congress
has
created
a
special
category,
it's
a
clear
red
light,
$100.00
an
ounce,
we
specially
reserve
that
for
illicit
transactions.
and
by
the
way,
the
legislative
history
makes
that
clear.
it
said
it
in
the
house
report
say
the
$100.00
is
for
illicit
transactions.
now,
you're
going
to
have
a
possessor
whose
possession
is
unlawful
under
virtually
the
laws
of
every
state.
go
to
the
secretary
of
the
treasury,
tender
a
$100.00
an
ounce
tax,
fill-out
an
order
form
which
asks
for
his
name,
his
address,
the
quantities
he
proposes
to
get,
and
who
is
going
to
transfer
it
to
him.
i
submit
that
that
is
submitting
the
jail
key
at
the
time
and
i
think
it's
clear
the
hazards
are
blatant.
now,
the
government
i
think
also
in
recognition
of
the
clear
force
of
this
argument
has
said
in
many
places
in
their
brief,
well,
the
petitioner
is
some
sort
of
fellow
who
is
on
psychedelic
cloud
number
9,
who
really
doesn't
care
about
this
fifth
amendment
privilege.
he
knew
about
our
policy.
he
knew
about
this
complete
prohibition
and
he
never
cared
in
this
matter
or
gave
no
concern
to
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
in
connection
with
his
failure
to
apply
for
the
tax,
to
pay
the
tax.
now,
in
the
testimony,
in
the
appendix,
pages
86,
87,
and
89,
i
think
the
testimony
completely
contradicts
that
position.
question
now,
“why
didn't
you
pay
the
transfer
tax
in
this
instance
on
the
marihuana
which
you
had?”
answer,
“well,
i
knew
that
i
couldn't
get
such
a
permission.
i
also
knew
that
if
i
had
applied
for
such
a
stamp,
i
would
probably
subject
myself
to
investigation.”
now,
as
i
read
the
next
excerpt,
i
think
it's
clear
that
permission
in
this
context,
the
petitioner
meant
applying
for
registration
which
is
as
very
clear
as
applicable
only
to
lawful
possessors,
there's
no
difference
between
the
government
and
petitioner
on
that.
question,
“do
you
the
tax
on
marihuana,
the
special
tax
on
marihuana?”
answer,
“its
my
understanding
that
for
one
dollar
or
three
dollars,
you
can
buy
some
sort
of
permit.”
and
that
is
by
the
way
the
amount
of
the
occupational
tax,
a
dollar
in
one
case
and
three
in
another.
and
that
--
and
if
you
have
marihuana
and
don't
have
a
permit,
it's
a
dollar
an
ounce.
question,
“wwhy
didn't
you
pay
that?”
answer,
“i
was
very
certain
that
i
would
not
be
able
to
pay
the
tax
on
the
marihuana
and
not
--
not
only
would
it
be
taken
away
from
me
but
i
would
be
subjected
to
action.”
question,
“did
you
or
did
you
not
have
an
honest
belief
that
you
could
not
obtain
the
permit
for
marihuana?”
answer,
"yes,
sir.
i
had
a
strong
and
honest
belief
that
i
could
not
get
it
and
that
it
would
cause
a
lot
of
publicity
and
trouble
for
both
the
government
and
myself.”
i
think
the
--
mr.
robert
j.
haft
no,
the
case
was
tried
before.
the
verdict
was
handed
down
by
the
jury
before
marchetti,
haynes
and
grosso
and
about
10
days
before
the
court
granted
certiorari
in
the
costello
case
which
first
gave
a
hint
that
this
issue
would
come
before
the
court.
the
last
point
on
the
self-incrimination
issue,
we
believe
that
if
we're
right
on
this
point
that
you
must
reverse
on
the
importation
count
as
well,
whether
we're
correct
or
not
on
the
presumption
point,
but
that
count
has
to
be
reversed
also
because
of
the
trial
judge's
instructions
in
this
case.
on
the
presumption
issue,
he
charged
the
statutory
presumption
that
the
jury
may
convict
unless
the
defendant
explains
the
satisfaction
--
his
possession
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
jury.
the
judge
then
added
to
that,
he
said,
“by
that
i
mean
unless
the
defendant
explains
that
his
possession
was
a
lawful
and
legitimate
possession,
immediately
thereafter,
the
trial
judge
charged
that
a
failure
to
pay
the
tax,
the
marihuana
tax,
the
failure
to
produce
the
order
form
on
demand
rendered
the
transaction
illegitimate.
so
that
the
jury
was
in
a
clear
position,
in
fact
was
suggesting
that
they
find
the
possession
illegitimate
on
the
importation
count
based
on
the
failure
to
pay
the
tax
or
produce
the
order
form.
the
second
issue
before
the
court
is
the
validity
of
statutory
presumption
in
176a
under
the
due
process
clause.
now,
the
statute
itself,
176a
is
a
very
narrow
crime
that's
defined.
it
is
that
whoever
knowingly
with
intent
to
defraud
the
united
states
in
any
manner
facilitates
the
transportation
of
marihuana
after
the
same
has
been
imported
and
knowing
that
the
marihuana
has
been
imported
is
guilty
of
a
crime.
mr.
robert
j.
haft
yes,
i
believe
that's
what
the
intent
to
defraud
the
united
states
means
because
another
part
of
the
statute
says
marihuana
which
should
have
been
invoiced,
meaning
that
it
should
have
import
duly
or
levy
should
have
been
placed
on
it
at
the
time
of
importation.
now,
these
narrow
statutory
elements
are
swept
away
by
the
presumption
which
just
says
that
mere
possession
is
presumptive
evidence
of
guilt
unless
the
defendant
explains
his
possession
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
jury.
now,
it's
our
position
that
that
presumption
is
not
rational,
it
does
not
comport
with
common
experience.
the
issue
was
raised
at
the
trial
by
evidence
which
was
introduced
showing
that
marihuana
grew
in
the
united
states,
grew
any
place
in
the
united
states,
and
offer
was
made
to
show
the
amount
of
marihuana
grown
domestically
and
the
proportions
of
marihuana
grow
domestically
as
against
importer,
that
offer
was
rejected
by
the
trial
court.
now,
my
position
is
that
whether
marihuana
is
imported
in
fact
is
an
arguable
proposition
but
that
whether
the
defendant
in
fact
knew
of
the
illegal
importation,
the
presumption
that
he
in
fact
knew
in
any
particular
case
is
an
irrational
presumption
and
that
in
either
of
that
applying
the
standard
of
reasonable
doubt
as
is
required
in
a
criminal
case
at
best
in
arguably
rational
proposition
is
one
that
ought
to
be
condemned
by
this
court.
in
the
reply
brief
in
this
matter,
a
--
i
cite
a
case
entitle
the
united
states
against
adams
which
was
decided
subsequent
to
the
submission
of
the
government's
brief
in
this
case.
in
united
states
against
adams,
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
new
york
made
various
findings
which
i
think
are
important
here.
i
think
that
the
legal
rationale
of
that
case
is
something
that
of
course
is
before
this
court
and
there's
no
sense
citing
another
precedent
on
that.
i
think
the
findings
are
important.
the
court
held
an
evidentiary
hearing
and
made
the
following
findings.
one,
that
marihuana
is
a
plant
which
grows
extensively
on
a
wild
basis
without
fertilization.
it
also
a
plant
that
is
easily
cultivated
and
is
very
hardy
in
its
growth
that
is
impossible
to
determine
whether
any
quantity
of
marihuana
is
imported
or
is
domestic
and
that
is
on
scientific
investigation
of
the
particular
quantity,
its
virtually
impossible.
most
importantly,
the
judge
found
that
common
experience
if
anything
tends
to
suggest
that
most
people
if
not
all
are
under
the
belief
that
marihuana
is
grown
domestically
and
that
that
explains
its
wide
spread
domestic
use.
in
this
regard,
the
judge
relied
upon
what
he
considered
the
stuff
of
common
experience,
the
everyday
newspaper
plus
with
federal
and
state
enforcement
officials
themselves
are
saying
about
this
problem.
and
the
strongest
argument
it
seems
to
me
on
the
extensiveness
of
the
domestic
growth
and
the
judge
found
it
was
very
very
substantial,
was
it
year
after
year,
the
enforcement
and
officials
point
out
that
this
is
a
vital
problem,
a
prevalent
problem
and
they
proudly
report
the
vast
acreage
destroyed
in
the
united
states.
and
the
very
next
year
the
bureau
of
narcotics
reports
another
vast
amount
of
acreage
that
they've
found
that
next
year
leading
to
the
inference
it
seems
to
me
that
there's
a
substantial
amount
that
is
not
discovered
each
year
and
which
does
form
the
source
of
supply
for
domestic
--
domestically
used
marihuana.
the
judge
referred
to
his
reading
of
the
everyday
newspaper
and
he
said
in
one
not
unsensational
newspaper
he
found
five
accounts
in
three
months
that
unsensational
newspaper
was
the
new
york
times,
and
one
of
the
article
that
he
cited
was
on
page
one
of
the
new
york
times,
on
august
21,
1968,
it
cited
in
his
opinion.
in
that
case,
in
jersey,
near
hoboken
in
jersey
city,
the
state
officials
had
found
an
area
of
meadow
lands
that
had
20,000
marihuana
plants
which
they
proceeded
to
destroy.
that
one
growth
was
enough
to
supply
one
cigarette
to
every
one
of
the
17
million
high
schools
students
in
the
country,
that
one
area.
in
some
areas,
marihuana
is
so
thick
that
a
truck
load
can
be
gathered
very
quickly.
plants,
some
as
high
as
10
feet
grow
along
the
susquehanna
railroad
tracks,
the
parallel
route
one
along
the
north
bergin
segment
of
the
meadow.
now,
this
is
a
problem
which
was
not
really
before
congress
at
the
time
in
1956
that
they
passed
the
presumption.
at
that
time,
they
had
commissioner
anslinger's
testimony
that
90%
of
seizures
in
the
united
state
came
from
mexico.
the
other
testimony
was
of
texas
and
border
enforcement
officials,
which
is
by
no
means
representative
of
the
experience
in
the
country.
taking
just
the
acreage
destroyed
by
the
bureau
of
narcotics
in
1965,
the
last
figure
that
the
bureau
itself
reported
which
is
on
page
17
of
their
annual
report
for
that
year,
there
were
1,900
acres
destroyed.
using
the
bureau's
own
estimate
of
yield
and
the
estimate
of
the
number
of
cigarettes
per
pound
from
the
article
i
read
to
you,
the
1965
seizures
alone,
destruction
of
acreage.
if
it
had
been
committed
to
yield
would
have
produced
2
billion
marihuana
cigarettes
or
10th
to
every
person
in
the
united
states.
marihuana
does
pass
from
many
hands
from
the
source
to
the
smoker,
and
i
think
that's
important
to
attesting
whether
or
not
a
defendant
should
he
held
to
know
or
could
know
the
basic
source
because
this
is
the
kind
of
thing
which
is
transferred
often.
another
function
--
mr.
robert
j.
haft
i
said
that
marihuana
in
the
traffic
passes
from
many
hands
from
the
original
source
or
the
grower
to
the
smoker.
there
maybe
20
or
30
middleman
in
the
transaction
and
telling
the
defendant
another
one
who's
caught
at
possession,
now
it's
up
to
you
to
explain
this
or
that
you
should
know
it's
rational
to
presume
that
you
knew
whether
it
was
imported
or
domestic,
i
say
it's
irrational.
i
say
that
because
this
is
a
criminal
presumption
that
were
talking
about
applicable
at
a
criminal
case,
the
standard
reasonable
doubt
are
oath
to
apply
here
and
that
you
are
telling
the
jury
when
you
permit
this
kind
of
presumption
that
this
probability
that
the
defendant
knew
that
a
given
quantity
of
marihuana
was
imported,
we're
telling
the
jury
when
we
use
that
presumption
that
the
probability
is
far
and
excess
of
50/50
that
the
defendant
knew
--
mr.
robert
j.
haft
i
support
it.
mr.
robert
j.
haft
yes,
i
do.
i
do
but
--
mr.
robert
j.
haft
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
do
agree
with
that.
i
do
agree
also
with
the
point
he
makes
that
this
kind
of
a
presumption
creates
a
very
unfair
situation
because
if
defendant
is
in
a
position
where
it's
impossible
for
him
to
defend
because
he
can't
defend
on
the
lack
of
knowledge
of
importation.
he
can't
go
back
and
try
and
prove
the
source
of
this
through
this
long
chain
of
title.
now,
its
quite
different
from
the
illegal
still
case
where
a
defendant
ought
to
be
in
a
position,
explain
why
he
is
20
feet
way
out
in
some
place,
its
dark,
why
is
he
there
that
night?
that
he
can
explain
but
he
can't
explain.
he
can't
prove.
he
doesn't
have
the
ability
to
prove
whether
that
marihuana
was
in
fact
imported.
mr.
robert
j.
haft
yes,
there
is
because
the
judge,
the
trial
judge
withdrew
the
first
count
which
was
a
smuggling
count
--
mr.
robert
j.
haft
on
the
theory
that
there
could
not
be
a
smuggling
into
or
importation
into
the
united
states
on
these
facts
because
he
had
admitted
acquisition
of
it
in
new
york,
had
practically
not
crossed
into
mexico,
it's
only
international.
mr.
robert
j.
haft
he
also
have
the
entire
issues
of
fact
on
whether
he
knew
on
the
way
back
over
the
bridge
whether
the
marihuana
had
been
thrown
out
of
the
car
or
not.
mr.
robert
j.
haft
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
stewart
but
--
mr.
robert
j.
haft
there
were
issues
raised
because
his
daughter
had
had
the
marihuana.
he
told
her
to
get
rid
of
it.
as
they
were
over
the
bridge
practically
at
the
custom
station,
she
told
him
she
hadn't.
the
whole
question
of
the
opportunity
to
stop
then
was
raised.
but
the
point
i
think
here
was
--
mr.
robert
j.
haft
yes,
i
--
mr.
robert
j.
haft
exactly.
mr.
robert
j.
haft
exactly.
the
government
in
their
brief
says,
“well,
there
is
this
alternative
theory.”
now,
there's
no
question
that
the
guilt
--
evidence
of
guilt
is
overwhelming
on
the
trip
to
mexico
back
to
texas
if
the
jury
so
believe.
but
because
of
the
use
of
the
unconstitutional
presumption
here
on
the
side
that
is
new
york
down
to
texas
coupled
with
a
statutory
presumption,
we
rely
on
the
romano
case
in
which
this
court
said
that
despite
overwhelming
evidence
of
guilt,
if
an
unconstitutional
presumption
is
in
a
case
and
we
can't
speculate
how
the
jury
found
whether
they
used
it
or
not,
we
are
going
to
reverse
the
case.
thank
you.
