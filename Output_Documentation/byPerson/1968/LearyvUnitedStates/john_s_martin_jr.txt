mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
with
the
court's
permission,
i
would
like
to
address
myself
first
to
the
question
concerning
the
validity
of
presumption
to
which
the
counsel
was
just
addressing
himself,
because
that
is
the
question
that
is
peculiar
to
this
case
and
is
not
related
to
the
--
immediately
following
case,
that's
united
states
v.
covington
which
also
raises
the
issue
raised
--
second
issue
in
this
case
as
to
the
validity
of
marihuana
tax
act.
section
176a
of
title
21
provides
basically
that
anyone
who
imports
or
receives,
conceals,
or
facilitates
the
transportation
concealment
or
sale
of
illegally
imported
marihuana,
knowing
that
it
is
illegally
imported
shall
be
guilty
of
a
federal
crime.
that
statute
also
contains
a
presumption
written
into
the
statute
by
congress,
and
that
presumption
in
the
statute
appears
at
page
44
(a)
of
the
appendix,
it
provides
that
whenever
on
trial
for
a
violation
of
this
subsection,
the
defendant
is
shown
to
have
or
to
have
had
the
marihuana
in
his
possession,
such
possession
shall
be
deemed
sufficient
evidence
to
authorize
conviction
unless
the
defendant
explains
his
possession
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
jury.
it
is
the
government's
position
in
this
case
that
that
statutory
presumption
is
valid.
at
the
outset,
i
think
i
should
make
clear
that
that
does
not
appear
to
be
a
dispute
between
council
as
to
the
proper
standard
to
be
applied
in
determining
whether
or
not
a
statutory
presumption
is
valid.
all
counsel
rely
on
the
articulation
of
that
standard
which
is
found
in
top
the
united
states
where
the
court
said
that
the
validity
of
the
statutory
presumption
depends
upon
the
rationality
of
the
connection
between
the
fact
proved
and
the
ultimate
presumed.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
what
the
statute
does
mr.
chief
justice
is
it
provide
that
possession
alone
will
give
rise
to
the
inference
that
the
defendant
knew
that
the
--
that
the
marihuana
was
imported
illegally,
one,
and
two,
that
the
defendant
knew
that.
so
this
--
the
actually
possession
gives
rise
to
all
of
the
other
elements
necessary
to
convict
under
the
statute
if
you
show
that
he
either
received
it
or
concealed
it
which
is
the
normal
case
in
any
one
of
this
cases.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
it
says
by
saying
that
possession
shall
be
deemed
sufficient
evidence
to
authorize
conviction
so
that
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
of
the
crime
stated
in
that
subsection
which
is
the
importation
or
the
receive
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that
it's
always
under
one
section,
that's
correct
mr.
chief
justice
so
that
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
the
presumption
clearly
carries
with
it
all
of
the
elements
contained
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
in
that
section
once
you
find
possession.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
no,
i
think
that
that
is
not
that.
i
think
that
what
the
top
rule
recognizes
is
that
there
are
certain
facts
that
give
rise
to
legitimate
inferences.
i
think
there
are
two
types
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
excuse
me?
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
it
will
not
support
certain
inferences.
clearly,
and
this
is
the
ruling
in
top
itself
that
the
fact
that
a
man
had
been
convicted
of
a
crime
and
he
had
in
his
possession
a
gun
could
not
support
an
inference
that
the
gun
had
been
transported
into
state
commerce
after
the
passage
of
the
firearms
act.
but
i
think
there
are
two
types
of
presumptions
that
the
law
really
recognizes.
one
of
those
that
flow,
would
you
might
say
would
flow
from
logic
alone,
for
example,
the
presumption
that
a
man
found
in
a
stolen
car
in
the
state
other
than
the
state
of
theft
knew
that
the
car
was
stolen
had
in
fact
transported
into
state
commerce.
that's
presumption
that
really
just
flows
from
the
basic
fact
of
finding
him
in
the
other
state
in
recent
possession
of
a
stolen
car.
however,
there
are
other
types
of
presumptions
and
i
think
that
the
presumption
in
gainey
is
one,
which
depends
upon
an
assessment
of
certain
empirical
data.
in
gainey,
you
had
a
situation
where
congress
determined
that
it
was
a
reasonable
presumption
that
someone
present
at
an
illicit
steal
side
was
engaged
in
the
business
of
operating
the
illicit
steal.
now
as
the
court
pointed
out
in
that
case,
i
don't
think
that
it
necessarily
would
flow
from
a
matter
of
logic
alone
from
possession,
from
presence
at
the
site
that
the
party
was
engaged
in
the
operation
of
the
steal
until
you
look
at
some
other
facts,
assess
some
empirical
data
relating
to
the
operation
of
a
steal,
and
that
is
that
people
engaged
in
that
type
of
operation.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think,
what
we
have
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that
is
a
possibility
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
absolutely,
and
that
possibility
existed
with
regard
to
the
opium
in
ye
ham
where
the
court
sustained
the
validity
of
silver
statute
in
regard
to
opium.
there
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
no,
i
admit
there
is
a
distinction
but
i
want
to
try
to
point
is
the
fact
that
it
is
possible
that
opium
that
someone
might
have
was
not
illegally
imported
but
was
in
fact
legally
imported
and
diverted
from
the
legal
market
sometime
after.
the
question
is,
is
the
inference
a
reasonable
one?
now,
i
think
with
regard
to
question
mr.
justice
marshall,
counsel
himself
has
conceded
the
validity
of
the
finding
in
adams
and
in
that
case
judge
frankel
determined
that
the
inference
that
marihuana
is
illegally
imported
was
a
valid
inference,
it
could
be
drawn.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
that
the
inference
contained
in
the
statute
that
when
someone
has
shown
to
have
been
in
possession
of
the
marihuana,
the
jury
can
infer
that
the
marihuana
was
illegally
imported.
he
found
that
to
be
a
valid
statutory
inference
and
counsel
here
has
accepted
that
decision
by
judge
frankel.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
yes,
he
did.
he
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
his
disposition
went
to
the
issue
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
from
possession
you
could
infer
not
only
that
the
marihuana
was
illegally
imported
which
he
said
you
could,
but
also
that
the
person
in
possession
knew
of
the
illegal
importation
of
marihuana.
now,
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
the
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
with
the
president's
crime
commission
mr.
justice
fortas
did
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
--
that
marihuana
--
most
of
marihuana
in
the
illicit
market
in
the
united
states
is
imported
at
the
country.
they
did
not
give
a
statistical
breakdown
of
this.
at
the
time
that
this
bill
was
before
congress,
commission
anslinger
testified
that
approximately
90%
of
the
marihuana
seized
in
the
illicit
markets
in
this
country
had
come
in
from
mexico,
and
i
think
its
significant
to
know
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
he
gave
not
a
statistical
break
--
breakdown
at
all
but
he
give
an
explanation
of
that
fact
which
relates
to
the
nature
of
mexican
marihuana
as
suppose
to
that
which
can
be
grown
domestically.
and
he
said
that
because
of
the
longer
growing
season
in
mexico,
the
mexican
marihuana
produces,
has
a
higher
alkaloid
content
and
this
is
what
produces
the
high,
this
is
what
the
marihuana
smoker
is
looking
for
in
marihuana.
and
i
think
that
it
is
for
this
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
it's
--
it
is
probably
true
mr.
justice
that
if
you
were
to
take
marihuana
and
carefully
cultivate
it
here
perhaps
in
a
hothouse
or
some
artificial
means,
you
could
produce
from
domestic
marihuana
a
strain
that
would
be
as
potent
as
that
which
normally
comes
in
from
mexico,
but
i
think
that
the
fact
of
experience
is
that
marihuana
is
just
growing
wild
which
has
been
referred
to
does
not
have
anywhere
near
that
potency.
and
it's
for
that
reason
that
the
marihuana
smoker
seeks
out
and
attempts
to
get
imported
marihuana.
and
if
the
court
please,
it's
for
this
reason,
it
is
because
the
mexican
marihuana
is
a
better
form
of
marihuana
that
we
submit
that
it
is
reasonable
to
assume
that
people
in
possession
of
marihuana
will
know
its
source.
i
think
that
if
there
is
a
weakness
in
judge
frankel's
opinion
and
with
all
respect
i
say
that
there
is,
is
that
judge
frankel
in
determining
whether
or
not
the
presumption
of
knowledge
is
valid
looks
not
to
the
relevant
segment
of
the
population
referred
to
in
the
statute
but
looks
to
the
population
in
general.
and
he
says
that
in
general,
people
reading
the
papers
will
see
that
their
marihuana
can
grow
wildly
in
the
united
states.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
there
was
some
question
raised
as
to
the
--
the
presumption
that
was
questioned
asked
of
a
witness
and
it
was
excluded.
i
would
say
the
dialog
is
set
fort
in
the
record
is
not
very
clear
on
the
entire
issue.
there
was
no
motion
made
pre-trial
as
there
had
been
in
adams
to
dismiss
the
indictment
because
the
invalidity
of
presumption.
so
the
record
is
--
well,
it
does
somewhat
support
that
as
far
from
clear.
but
i
do
think
that
this
presumption
of
knowledge
is
valid
when
you
look
at
it
in
terms
of
the
people
to
whom
the
statute
is
directed.
the
statute
is
directed
to
those
in
possession
of
the
marihuana
and
in
view
of
commissioners
anslinger's
testimony
and
some
other
authorities
which
are
cited
in
--
at
page
39
in
our
brief
that
those
people
who
use
marihuana,
want
the
mexican
marihuana
because
it
produces
the
better
high.
it
seems
to
me
that
these
people
are
going
to
know
where
that
marihuana
came
from
because
i
would
assume
and
i
think
it's
obvious
that
the
price
that
they
pay
for
marihuana
is
going
to
depend
upon
the
quality
of
the
marihuana
that
they
receive.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
would
submit
not.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
certainly
don't
know.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
think
that
the
only
statistics
that
i
think
are
somewhat
persuasive
or
not
the
only
but
the
ones
that
i
think
is
somewhat
persuasive
mr.
justice
marshall
are
those
which
appear
at
page
40
of
our
brief
in
the
footnote
which
has
to
do
with
the
amount
of
seizures
of
marihuana
that
have
been
taking
place
at
our
borders
over
the
last
eight
years.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
but
i
think
what
you
have
--
no,
what
i'm
trying
to
emphasize
here
is
if
you
look
at
those
statistics,
you'll
see
that
1962,
we
seized
at
the
borders
one
--
approximately
1000
kilograms
of
marihuana.
in
1967,
we
seized
at
the
borders
23,426
kilograms
of
marihuana.
i
think
this
escalating
amount
of
importation
and
i
think
this
--
all
this
reflects
is
that
the
importation
of
marihuana
is
increasing
in
this
country.
and
i
think
that
this
fact
supports
the
view
that
there
is
--
that
is
continuing
in
this
country
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
a
desire
for
mexican
marihuana
for
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that
is
possible
but
i
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
think
that's
true.
i
could
relate
to
other
factors
but
i
don't
think
there
has
been
any
significant
increase
in
the
amount
of
customs
investigative
located
at
the
borders.
it
is
possible
that
it's
just
reflecting
a
general
overall
demand
from
marihuana
but
i
do
think
that
the
figures
are
so
significant
that
they
show
the
desire
again
for
mexican
marihuana,
that
is
the
stuff
with
which
the
illicit
marihuana
market
operates.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
think
the
--
there
is
a
difference
in
that
i
think
congress
had
before
it
evidence
which
justified
and
concluded.
and
this
court
said
in
gainey
that
this
is
the
type
of
thing
which
comes
within
the
fact
finding
power
of
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
think
the
difference
is
that
there
is
some
basis
from
what
congress
knew
about
the
marihuana
traffic.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think
it
can.
i
think
it
can
in
terms
of
defining
a
crime
among
other
things.
i
think
that
it
would
have
been
possible
i
would
submit
for
congress
to
have
adapted
a
statute
that
just
made
it
a
crime
to
possess
marihuana
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
then,
i
think
that
that
would
be
clearly
be
unconstitutional.
i
think
the
question
is
within
those
limits
of
what
can
congress
do
and
well,
i
can
do
is
say
that
in
gainey,
the
court
sustained
the
power
of
congress
to
enact
reasonable
presumptions
and
we
think
that
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
has
to
as
the
court
said
in
todd,
depends
upon
the
rational
of
the
connection
between
the
fact
that
congress
says
should
be
proved
and
what
would
be
presumed.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
to
what
this
court
has
said
is
that
is
unnecessary
--
that
is
a
mixed
question.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
and
i
understand
what
your
position
mr.
justice
but
i
do
think
that
the
court's
cases
do
sustain
the
validity
of
the
presumption
here
and
with
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
think
the
government's
own
proof
of
the
--
following
the
arrest
in
his
own
field
would
overcome
the
presumptions.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
think
the
government's
own
proof
that
he
was
on
his
field
would
clearly
overcome
any
presumption
in
that
case.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think
he
could
be
being
charged
with
the
possession
of
the
marihuana
and
still
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
mean
he's
being
charged
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
their
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think
we
could
do
what
the
defendant
did
in
adams
among
other
things
was
to
challenge
it
before
trial.
i
think
there's
also
possibility
of
other
evidence
could
be
presented
on
that.
not
i
think
but
what
we're
dealing
with
is
not
the
peculiar
case
but
the
generality
of
cases
which
congress
has
determined
that
this
presumption
should
apply.
it
may
have
been
that
the
man
in
gainey
just
wanted
onto
the
site
of
the
steal,
but
the
court
said
it
was
still
rational
to
allow
the
presumption
to
follow.
it
maybe
a
man
found
stolen
car
across
the
border
10
minutes
after
the
car
has
been
stolen
in
another
state,
didn't
steal
it,
it
just
happen
to
come
in,
he
was
tired
and
sit
down
but
i
think
that
the
question
here
is
the
rationality
of
the
presumption.
with
the
court's
permission
i
would
like
to
turn
to
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
has
some
bearing
on
it,
but
i
do
think
what
we
know
about
the
desire
of
the
people
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think
this
is
what
the
statute
provides
and
it's
our
submission
that
the
statute
in
view
of
the
facts
that
we
know
about
the
illicit
marihuana
traffic
makes
that
a
rational
presumption.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
it
may
please
the
court.
i
would
like
this
morning
to
turn
and
address
myself
to
petitioner's
contention
that
his
conviction
on
charge
for
transporting
and
concealing
marijuana
on
which
the
tax
hadn't
been
paid
in
violation
of
section
4744
(a)(2)
of
title
xxvi
is
unconstitutional
because
the
conviction
on
that
count
violated
his
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
to
a
certain
extent,
the
claim
raised
here
is
identical
to
that
presented
in
the
case
to
follow
this,
united
states
v.
covington.
there
is
a
significant
difference,
however,
because
in
this
case,
we
do
have
a
factual
record
against
which
petitioner's
assertion
of
this
claim
can
be
judged.
i'd
like
to
turn
to
that
record,
if
i
right,
for
a
moment.
prior
to
trial,
petitioner's
counsel
moved
for
a
continuance
to
allow
him
to
prepare
his
defenses.
in
the
motion
for
continuance,
petitioner's
counsel
stated,
this
appears
at
page
34
of
the
record,
“defenses
will
be
raised
which
would
show
that
this
defendant
is
an
authority
on
psychedelics
drugs
which
this
defendant
maintains,
includes
marijuana
and
that
he
should
be
have
the
right
of
experimentation
with
such
drug,
including
marijuana
and
that,
although
there
are
provisions
in
the
law,
which
would
seem
to
allow
a
person
to
experiment
with
marijuana,
such
provisions
are
in
actuality
non-existent
because
it
is
not
possible
to
obtain
an
order
form
and
legally
pay
the
tax
on
marijuana
and
any
use
without
such
order
forms
are
held
to
be
illegal”.
similarly,
at
the
close
of
the
case,
in
arguing
–
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that's
not
in
the
printed
appendix
-
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
it
is
in
the
record
which
is
in
the
court.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
and
that
unfortunately
is
true
of
the
other
point
that
i
intend
to
refer
to
at
this
time.
at
the
close
of
the
case,
petitioner
moved
for
judgment
of
acquittal.
that
time,
his
counsel
stated,
this
is
at
page
493
of
the
record,
under
the
tax
count,
doctors
or
scientists
working
in
a
laboratory
can
obtain
marijuana,
but
not
those
who
are
using
it
for
religious
beliefs.
and
again
at
the
close,
after
the
verdict
had
come
in
-and
the
motion
for
new
trial
which
was
filed,
-counsel
argued,
-this
is
the
written
motion
for
new
trial
submitted
after
the
judgment,
it
appears
at
page
649
of
the
record.
the
court
erred
in
denying
defendant's
motion
for
judgment
of
acquittal
as
to
count
two
and
three
of
the
indictment
for
the
reason
that
the
evidence
demonstrated,
the
defendant
transported
and
possessed
marijuana
in
pursuit
of
his
free
exercise
of
his
religion,
in
pursuit
of
scientific
experimentation
out
of
the
laboratory
and
in
pursuit
of
his
right
to
bring
up
his
family
according
to
his
own
honest
belief.
and
since
the
$100
an
ounce
tax
is
a
prohibitive
tax,
conviction
on
the
count
three
as
well
as
count
two
would
violate
the
first,
fifth
and
ninth
amendments
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
of
america.
it
is
the
government's
position
in
this
case
that
petitioner
from
the
outset
recognized
that
his
failure
to
comply
with
the
marijuana
tax
act
was
not
the
result
of
any
fear
that
he
would
tend
to
incriminate
himself,
but
rather
on
his
recognition
that
the
act
acted
as
to
him
as
a
total
bar
on
his
right
to
possess
marijuana.
we
submit
that
the
petitioner
correctly
construed
the
act.
that
it's
our
contention
that
the
marijuana
tax
act
as
construed
and
applied,
does
not
compel
self-incrimination
because
it
prohibits
those
who
could
not
legally
deal
in
marijuana
from
handling
marijuana.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think,
mr.
chief
justice,
what
we
have
to
do
is
examine
the
validity
of
the
claim
and
i
think
it
has
to
be
examined
against
the
factual
basis
of
what
he
believed,
his
counsel
mentioned
yesterday.
petitioner
testified
at
the
trial
that
he
knew
he
could
not
obtain
marijuana
under
the
act.
so,
you
have
that
also.
it
is
position
that
here
the
tax
act
in
question
was
designed
by
congress
to
prohibit,
and
that
is
clearly
stated
in
each
of
the
reports
accompanying
the
legislation
that
the
bill
was
designed
to
prohibit
those
who
could
not
legally
handle
marijuana
from
doing
so.
congress
did
this
by
imposing
a
prohibitive
tax.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think,
mr.
justice,
what
we
are
asking
the
court
to
do
is
to
look
at
the
statute
in
terms
of
the
realities.
and
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
record
before
congress
which
included
testimony
from
mr.
hester
who
has
been
referred
to
previously
and
others
that
at
the
time
this
tax
was
enacted,
marijuana
was
selling
in
the
illicit
market
at
$1
an
ounce.
congress
imposed
the
$100
an
ounce
tax,
clearly
prohibited.
i
think
the
fact
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
yes,
we
do,
i
think
that
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that
is
correct.
that
is
the
way
the
act
is
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that's
correct.
i
think
that
it's
important
to
note
also,
mr.
justice
fortas
that
what
you
had
here,
which
you
didn't
have
in
grosso
and
marchetti
is
that
an
industry
in
which
marijuana
had
legitimate
and
illegal
uses
and
congress
was
attempting
to
distinguish
those.
that's
why
i
think
all
of
the
reporting
requirements
contains
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
no,
it
doesn't
because
congress
says
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that
is
correct.
but
there,
that
showed
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
in
marchetti
and
grosso
particularly,
however
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
in
haynes,
there
was,
again
there
was
a
$200
tax.
in
haynes,
we're
dealing
only
with
one
particular
requirement
of
the
act
which
clearly
required
people
to
register
if
they
had
a
firearm
of
the
type
described
in
that
statute.
here,
however,
i
think
that
it's
important
to
note
that
all
of
the
disclosure
requirements
are
directed
basically
at
the
legal
industry,
the
legal
marijuana
industry
so
that
legal
use
of
marijuana
would
be
made
public
and
that
the
law
enforcement
officials
could
see
that
the
legal
marijuana
was
not
diverted
-into
illegal
channels.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think
there
was
--
the
only
reason
they
didn't
enact
a
totally
prohibitive
statute
insofar
as
illegal
transactions
were
concerned,
there
was
a
legal
market
for
this
so
they
couldn't
totally
prohibit
it.
but
insofar
as
the
illegal
market
was
concerned,
the
reason
they
chose
to
use
the
prohibitive
tax
form
was
i
think
because
at
the
time
congress
was
concerned
with
the
five,
four
decision
of
this
case
and
the
63
decision
in
nigro
and
doremus
and
they
were
afraid,
unless
the
prohibitive
section
was
not
put
in
terms
of
that
prohibitive
tax,
there
might
be
some
constitutional
problems
with
that.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
what
they
had,
mr.
justice,
in
the
harrison
act
made
all
of
the
--
prohibited
all
the
legitimate
forms
in
dealing
in
the
narcotics
involved
there.
i
think
there
was
some
concern
because
the
close
decision
of
this
court
in
those
cases,
the
fact
that
there
was
a
general
probation
not
formed
in
terms
of
the
tax
created
some
problems.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think,
mr.
justice,
that
what
we
are
asking
the
court
to
do
is
to
look
at
the
reality
of
the
situation,
to
look
at
the
fact
that
since
this
act
was
enacted,
providing
this
$100
tax
on
one
ounce
of
marijuana
that
was
selling
in
the
illicit
market
for
dollar,
no
person
has
ever
applied
to
pay
for
this
tax.
that
the
effect
of
it
was
to
make
it
a
prohibitive
tax.
therefore,
this
court
talked
in
grosso
and
marchetti
of
the
fact
that
the
claim
of
the
fifth
amendment
has
to
be
real
and
appreciable.
so
we
submit
here
that
the
court
has
to
look
at
the
whole
statutory
scheme
in
this
framework.
i
think,
from
that
examination,
it
appears
here
that
the
claim
of
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
is
not
real
and
substantial,
but
rather
a
fanciful
and
imaginary
claim
which
petitioner
came
up
with
after
the
fact
in
an
attempt
to
excuse
his
clear
violation
of
federal
law.
and,
so
for
that
reason
we
feel
that
the
contention
of
fifth
amendment
privilege
here
should
be
rejected
by
this
court.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think
it
would
be
the
same
except
that
we
would
not
have
his
testimony
relied
on.
i
think
we
do
have
a
lawyer's
construction
of
the
act.
the
counsel
yesterday
said
that
the
government's
construction
here
was
an
imaginative
one
and
suggested
it
was
something
novel.
here
is
a
lawyer
looking
at
the
act
and
construes
it
in
the
same
way
we
did
before
the
issue
was
ever
raised.
i
think
it's
somewhat
persuasive
in
that
standpoint.
i
think
two,
it
goes
to
the
reality
of
the
situation
of
the
fact
that
this
act,
everybody
recognized,
prohibits
people
who
could
not
handle
marijuana
legally
from
doing
so.
the
practical
effect
of
it
is
the
total
bar.
and
for
that
reason,
the
claim
of
fifth
amendment
privilege
is
really
a
fanciful
one
which
we
submit
was
constructed
after
the
fact
and
not
the
true
motivating
reason
that
the
petitioner
did
not
attempt
to
comply
with
the
act.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
with
the
court's
permission,
i
would
like
to
address
myself
first
to
the
question
concerning
the
validity
of
presumption
to
which
the
counsel
was
just
addressing
himself,
because
that
is
the
question
that
is
peculiar
to
this
case
and
is
not
related
to
the
--
immediately
following
case,
that's
united
states
v.
covington
which
also
raises
the
issue
raised
--
second
issue
in
this
case
as
to
the
validity
of
marihuana
tax
act.
section
176a
of
title
21
provides
basically
that
anyone
who
imports
or
receives,
conceals,
or
facilitates
the
transportation
concealment
or
sale
of
illegally
imported
marihuana,
knowing
that
it
is
illegally
imported
shall
be
guilty
of
a
federal
crime.
that
statute
also
contains
a
presumption
written
into
the
statute
by
congress,
and
that
presumption
in
the
statute
appears
at
page
44
(a)
of
the
appendix,
it
provides
that
whenever
on
trial
for
a
violation
of
this
subsection,
the
defendant
is
shown
to
have
or
to
have
had
the
marihuana
in
his
possession,
such
possession
shall
be
deemed
sufficient
evidence
to
authorize
conviction
unless
the
defendant
explains
his
possession
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
jury.
it
is
the
government's
position
in
this
case
that
that
statutory
presumption
is
valid.
at
the
outset,
i
think
i
should
make
clear
that
that
does
not
appear
to
be
a
dispute
between
council
as
to
the
proper
standard
to
be
applied
in
determining
whether
or
not
a
statutory
presumption
is
valid.
all
counsel
rely
on
the
articulation
of
that
standard
which
is
found
in
top
the
united
states
where
the
court
said
that
the
validity
of
the
statutory
presumption
depends
upon
the
rationality
of
the
connection
between
the
fact
proved
and
the
ultimate
presumed.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
what
the
statute
does
mr.
chief
justice
is
it
provide
that
possession
alone
will
give
rise
to
the
inference
that
the
defendant
knew
that
the
--
that
the
marihuana
was
imported
illegally,
one,
and
two,
that
the
defendant
knew
that.
so
this
--
the
actually
possession
gives
rise
to
all
of
the
other
elements
necessary
to
convict
under
the
statute
if
you
show
that
he
either
received
it
or
concealed
it
which
is
the
normal
case
in
any
one
of
this
cases.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
it
says
by
saying
that
possession
shall
be
deemed
sufficient
evidence
to
authorize
conviction
so
that
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
of
the
crime
stated
in
that
subsection
which
is
the
importation
or
the
receive
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that
it's
always
under
one
section,
that's
correct
mr.
chief
justice
so
that
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
the
presumption
clearly
carries
with
it
all
of
the
elements
contained
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
in
that
section
once
you
find
possession.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
no,
i
think
that
that
is
not
that.
i
think
that
what
the
top
rule
recognizes
is
that
there
are
certain
facts
that
give
rise
to
legitimate
inferences.
i
think
there
are
two
types
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
excuse
me?
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
it
will
not
support
certain
inferences.
clearly,
and
this
is
the
ruling
in
top
itself
that
the
fact
that
a
man
had
been
convicted
of
a
crime
and
he
had
in
his
possession
a
gun
could
not
support
an
inference
that
the
gun
had
been
transported
into
state
commerce
after
the
passage
of
the
firearms
act.
but
i
think
there
are
two
types
of
presumptions
that
the
law
really
recognizes.
one
of
those
that
flow,
would
you
might
say
would
flow
from
logic
alone,
for
example,
the
presumption
that
a
man
found
in
a
stolen
car
in
the
state
other
than
the
state
of
theft
knew
that
the
car
was
stolen
had
in
fact
transported
into
state
commerce.
that's
presumption
that
really
just
flows
from
the
basic
fact
of
finding
him
in
the
other
state
in
recent
possession
of
a
stolen
car.
however,
there
are
other
types
of
presumptions
and
i
think
that
the
presumption
in
gainey
is
one,
which
depends
upon
an
assessment
of
certain
empirical
data.
in
gainey,
you
had
a
situation
where
congress
determined
that
it
was
a
reasonable
presumption
that
someone
present
at
an
illicit
steal
side
was
engaged
in
the
business
of
operating
the
illicit
steal.
now
as
the
court
pointed
out
in
that
case,
i
don't
think
that
it
necessarily
would
flow
from
a
matter
of
logic
alone
from
possession,
from
presence
at
the
site
that
the
party
was
engaged
in
the
operation
of
the
steal
until
you
look
at
some
other
facts,
assess
some
empirical
data
relating
to
the
operation
of
a
steal,
and
that
is
that
people
engaged
in
that
type
of
operation.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think,
what
we
have
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that
is
a
possibility
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
absolutely,
and
that
possibility
existed
with
regard
to
the
opium
in
ye
ham
where
the
court
sustained
the
validity
of
silver
statute
in
regard
to
opium.
there
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
no,
i
admit
there
is
a
distinction
but
i
want
to
try
to
point
is
the
fact
that
it
is
possible
that
opium
that
someone
might
have
was
not
illegally
imported
but
was
in
fact
legally
imported
and
diverted
from
the
legal
market
sometime
after.
the
question
is,
is
the
inference
a
reasonable
one?
now,
i
think
with
regard
to
question
mr.
justice
marshall,
counsel
himself
has
conceded
the
validity
of
the
finding
in
adams
and
in
that
case
judge
frankel
determined
that
the
inference
that
marihuana
is
illegally
imported
was
a
valid
inference,
it
could
be
drawn.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
that
the
inference
contained
in
the
statute
that
when
someone
has
shown
to
have
been
in
possession
of
the
marihuana,
the
jury
can
infer
that
the
marihuana
was
illegally
imported.
he
found
that
to
be
a
valid
statutory
inference
and
counsel
here
has
accepted
that
decision
by
judge
frankel.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
yes,
he
did.
he
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
his
disposition
went
to
the
issue
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
from
possession
you
could
infer
not
only
that
the
marihuana
was
illegally
imported
which
he
said
you
could,
but
also
that
the
person
in
possession
knew
of
the
illegal
importation
of
marihuana.
now,
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
the
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
with
the
president's
crime
commission
mr.
justice
fortas
did
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
--
that
marihuana
--
most
of
marihuana
in
the
illicit
market
in
the
united
states
is
imported
at
the
country.
they
did
not
give
a
statistical
breakdown
of
this.
at
the
time
that
this
bill
was
before
congress,
commission
anslinger
testified
that
approximately
90%
of
the
marihuana
seized
in
the
illicit
markets
in
this
country
had
come
in
from
mexico,
and
i
think
its
significant
to
know
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
he
gave
not
a
statistical
break
--
breakdown
at
all
but
he
give
an
explanation
of
that
fact
which
relates
to
the
nature
of
mexican
marihuana
as
suppose
to
that
which
can
be
grown
domestically.
and
he
said
that
because
of
the
longer
growing
season
in
mexico,
the
mexican
marihuana
produces,
has
a
higher
alkaloid
content
and
this
is
what
produces
the
high,
this
is
what
the
marihuana
smoker
is
looking
for
in
marihuana.
and
i
think
that
it
is
for
this
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
it's
--
it
is
probably
true
mr.
justice
that
if
you
were
to
take
marihuana
and
carefully
cultivate
it
here
perhaps
in
a
hothouse
or
some
artificial
means,
you
could
produce
from
domestic
marihuana
a
strain
that
would
be
as
potent
as
that
which
normally
comes
in
from
mexico,
but
i
think
that
the
fact
of
experience
is
that
marihuana
is
just
growing
wild
which
has
been
referred
to
does
not
have
anywhere
near
that
potency.
and
it's
for
that
reason
that
the
marihuana
smoker
seeks
out
and
attempts
to
get
imported
marihuana.
and
if
the
court
please,
it's
for
this
reason,
it
is
because
the
mexican
marihuana
is
a
better
form
of
marihuana
that
we
submit
that
it
is
reasonable
to
assume
that
people
in
possession
of
marihuana
will
know
its
source.
i
think
that
if
there
is
a
weakness
in
judge
frankel's
opinion
and
with
all
respect
i
say
that
there
is,
is
that
judge
frankel
in
determining
whether
or
not
the
presumption
of
knowledge
is
valid
looks
not
to
the
relevant
segment
of
the
population
referred
to
in
the
statute
but
looks
to
the
population
in
general.
and
he
says
that
in
general,
people
reading
the
papers
will
see
that
their
marihuana
can
grow
wildly
in
the
united
states.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
there
was
some
question
raised
as
to
the
--
the
presumption
that
was
questioned
asked
of
a
witness
and
it
was
excluded.
i
would
say
the
dialog
is
set
fort
in
the
record
is
not
very
clear
on
the
entire
issue.
there
was
no
motion
made
pre-trial
as
there
had
been
in
adams
to
dismiss
the
indictment
because
the
invalidity
of
presumption.
so
the
record
is
--
well,
it
does
somewhat
support
that
as
far
from
clear.
but
i
do
think
that
this
presumption
of
knowledge
is
valid
when
you
look
at
it
in
terms
of
the
people
to
whom
the
statute
is
directed.
the
statute
is
directed
to
those
in
possession
of
the
marihuana
and
in
view
of
commissioners
anslinger's
testimony
and
some
other
authorities
which
are
cited
in
--
at
page
39
in
our
brief
that
those
people
who
use
marihuana,
want
the
mexican
marihuana
because
it
produces
the
better
high.
it
seems
to
me
that
these
people
are
going
to
know
where
that
marihuana
came
from
because
i
would
assume
and
i
think
it's
obvious
that
the
price
that
they
pay
for
marihuana
is
going
to
depend
upon
the
quality
of
the
marihuana
that
they
receive.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
would
submit
not.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
certainly
don't
know.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
think
that
the
only
statistics
that
i
think
are
somewhat
persuasive
or
not
the
only
but
the
ones
that
i
think
is
somewhat
persuasive
mr.
justice
marshall
are
those
which
appear
at
page
40
of
our
brief
in
the
footnote
which
has
to
do
with
the
amount
of
seizures
of
marihuana
that
have
been
taking
place
at
our
borders
over
the
last
eight
years.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
but
i
think
what
you
have
--
no,
what
i'm
trying
to
emphasize
here
is
if
you
look
at
those
statistics,
you'll
see
that
1962,
we
seized
at
the
borders
one
--
approximately
1000
kilograms
of
marihuana.
in
1967,
we
seized
at
the
borders
23,426
kilograms
of
marihuana.
i
think
this
escalating
amount
of
importation
and
i
think
this
--
all
this
reflects
is
that
the
importation
of
marihuana
is
increasing
in
this
country.
and
i
think
that
this
fact
supports
the
view
that
there
is
--
that
is
continuing
in
this
country
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
a
desire
for
mexican
marihuana
for
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that
is
possible
but
i
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
think
that's
true.
i
could
relate
to
other
factors
but
i
don't
think
there
has
been
any
significant
increase
in
the
amount
of
customs
investigative
located
at
the
borders.
it
is
possible
that
it's
just
reflecting
a
general
overall
demand
from
marihuana
but
i
do
think
that
the
figures
are
so
significant
that
they
show
the
desire
again
for
mexican
marihuana,
that
is
the
stuff
with
which
the
illicit
marihuana
market
operates.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
think
the
--
there
is
a
difference
in
that
i
think
congress
had
before
it
evidence
which
justified
and
concluded.
and
this
court
said
in
gainey
that
this
is
the
type
of
thing
which
comes
within
the
fact
finding
power
of
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
think
the
difference
is
that
there
is
some
basis
from
what
congress
knew
about
the
marihuana
traffic.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think
it
can.
i
think
it
can
in
terms
of
defining
a
crime
among
other
things.
i
think
that
it
would
have
been
possible
i
would
submit
for
congress
to
have
adapted
a
statute
that
just
made
it
a
crime
to
possess
marihuana
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
then,
i
think
that
that
would
be
clearly
be
unconstitutional.
i
think
the
question
is
within
those
limits
of
what
can
congress
do
and
well,
i
can
do
is
say
that
in
gainey,
the
court
sustained
the
power
of
congress
to
enact
reasonable
presumptions
and
we
think
that
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
has
to
as
the
court
said
in
todd,
depends
upon
the
rational
of
the
connection
between
the
fact
that
congress
says
should
be
proved
and
what
would
be
presumed.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
to
what
this
court
has
said
is
that
is
unnecessary
--
that
is
a
mixed
question.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
and
i
understand
what
your
position
mr.
justice
but
i
do
think
that
the
court's
cases
do
sustain
the
validity
of
the
presumption
here
and
with
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
think
the
government's
own
proof
of
the
--
following
the
arrest
in
his
own
field
would
overcome
the
presumptions.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
think
the
government's
own
proof
that
he
was
on
his
field
would
clearly
overcome
any
presumption
in
that
case.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think
he
could
be
being
charged
with
the
possession
of
the
marihuana
and
still
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
mean
he's
being
charged
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
their
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think
we
could
do
what
the
defendant
did
in
adams
among
other
things
was
to
challenge
it
before
trial.
i
think
there's
also
possibility
of
other
evidence
could
be
presented
on
that.
not
i
think
but
what
we're
dealing
with
is
not
the
peculiar
case
but
the
generality
of
cases
which
congress
has
determined
that
this
presumption
should
apply.
it
may
have
been
that
the
man
in
gainey
just
wanted
onto
the
site
of
the
steal,
but
the
court
said
it
was
still
rational
to
allow
the
presumption
to
follow.
it
maybe
a
man
found
stolen
car
across
the
border
10
minutes
after
the
car
has
been
stolen
in
another
state,
didn't
steal
it,
it
just
happen
to
come
in,
he
was
tired
and
sit
down
but
i
think
that
the
question
here
is
the
rationality
of
the
presumption.
with
the
court's
permission
i
would
like
to
turn
to
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
has
some
bearing
on
it,
but
i
do
think
what
we
know
about
the
desire
of
the
people
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think
this
is
what
the
statute
provides
and
it's
our
submission
that
the
statute
in
view
of
the
facts
that
we
know
about
the
illicit
marihuana
traffic
makes
that
a
rational
presumption.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
it
may
please
the
court.
i
would
like
this
morning
to
turn
and
address
myself
to
petitioner's
contention
that
his
conviction
on
charge
for
transporting
and
concealing
marijuana
on
which
the
tax
hadn't
been
paid
in
violation
of
section
4744
(a)(2)
of
title
xxvi
is
unconstitutional
because
the
conviction
on
that
count
violated
his
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
to
a
certain
extent,
the
claim
raised
here
is
identical
to
that
presented
in
the
case
to
follow
this,
united
states
v.
covington.
there
is
a
significant
difference,
however,
because
in
this
case,
we
do
have
a
factual
record
against
which
petitioner's
assertion
of
this
claim
can
be
judged.
i'd
like
to
turn
to
that
record,
if
i
right,
for
a
moment.
prior
to
trial,
petitioner's
counsel
moved
for
a
continuance
to
allow
him
to
prepare
his
defenses.
in
the
motion
for
continuance,
petitioner's
counsel
stated,
this
appears
at
page
34
of
the
record,
“defenses
will
be
raised
which
would
show
that
this
defendant
is
an
authority
on
psychedelics
drugs
which
this
defendant
maintains,
includes
marijuana
and
that
he
should
be
have
the
right
of
experimentation
with
such
drug,
including
marijuana
and
that,
although
there
are
provisions
in
the
law,
which
would
seem
to
allow
a
person
to
experiment
with
marijuana,
such
provisions
are
in
actuality
non-existent
because
it
is
not
possible
to
obtain
an
order
form
and
legally
pay
the
tax
on
marijuana
and
any
use
without
such
order
forms
are
held
to
be
illegal”.
similarly,
at
the
close
of
the
case,
in
arguing
–
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that's
not
in
the
printed
appendix
-
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
it
is
in
the
record
which
is
in
the
court.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
and
that
unfortunately
is
true
of
the
other
point
that
i
intend
to
refer
to
at
this
time.
at
the
close
of
the
case,
petitioner
moved
for
judgment
of
acquittal.
that
time,
his
counsel
stated,
this
is
at
page
493
of
the
record,
under
the
tax
count,
doctors
or
scientists
working
in
a
laboratory
can
obtain
marijuana,
but
not
those
who
are
using
it
for
religious
beliefs.
and
again
at
the
close,
after
the
verdict
had
come
in
-and
the
motion
for
new
trial
which
was
filed,
-counsel
argued,
-this
is
the
written
motion
for
new
trial
submitted
after
the
judgment,
it
appears
at
page
649
of
the
record.
the
court
erred
in
denying
defendant's
motion
for
judgment
of
acquittal
as
to
count
two
and
three
of
the
indictment
for
the
reason
that
the
evidence
demonstrated,
the
defendant
transported
and
possessed
marijuana
in
pursuit
of
his
free
exercise
of
his
religion,
in
pursuit
of
scientific
experimentation
out
of
the
laboratory
and
in
pursuit
of
his
right
to
bring
up
his
family
according
to
his
own
honest
belief.
and
since
the
$100
an
ounce
tax
is
a
prohibitive
tax,
conviction
on
the
count
three
as
well
as
count
two
would
violate
the
first,
fifth
and
ninth
amendments
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
of
america.
it
is
the
government's
position
in
this
case
that
petitioner
from
the
outset
recognized
that
his
failure
to
comply
with
the
marijuana
tax
act
was
not
the
result
of
any
fear
that
he
would
tend
to
incriminate
himself,
but
rather
on
his
recognition
that
the
act
acted
as
to
him
as
a
total
bar
on
his
right
to
possess
marijuana.
we
submit
that
the
petitioner
correctly
construed
the
act.
that
it's
our
contention
that
the
marijuana
tax
act
as
construed
and
applied,
does
not
compel
self-incrimination
because
it
prohibits
those
who
could
not
legally
deal
in
marijuana
from
handling
marijuana.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think,
mr.
chief
justice,
what
we
have
to
do
is
examine
the
validity
of
the
claim
and
i
think
it
has
to
be
examined
against
the
factual
basis
of
what
he
believed,
his
counsel
mentioned
yesterday.
petitioner
testified
at
the
trial
that
he
knew
he
could
not
obtain
marijuana
under
the
act.
so,
you
have
that
also.
it
is
position
that
here
the
tax
act
in
question
was
designed
by
congress
to
prohibit,
and
that
is
clearly
stated
in
each
of
the
reports
accompanying
the
legislation
that
the
bill
was
designed
to
prohibit
those
who
could
not
legally
handle
marijuana
from
doing
so.
congress
did
this
by
imposing
a
prohibitive
tax.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think,
mr.
justice,
what
we
are
asking
the
court
to
do
is
to
look
at
the
statute
in
terms
of
the
realities.
and
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
record
before
congress
which
included
testimony
from
mr.
hester
who
has
been
referred
to
previously
and
others
that
at
the
time
this
tax
was
enacted,
marijuana
was
selling
in
the
illicit
market
at
$1
an
ounce.
congress
imposed
the
$100
an
ounce
tax,
clearly
prohibited.
i
think
the
fact
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
yes,
we
do,
i
think
that
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that
is
correct.
that
is
the
way
the
act
is
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that's
correct.
i
think
that
it's
important
to
note
also,
mr.
justice
fortas
that
what
you
had
here,
which
you
didn't
have
in
grosso
and
marchetti
is
that
an
industry
in
which
marijuana
had
legitimate
and
illegal
uses
and
congress
was
attempting
to
distinguish
those.
that's
why
i
think
all
of
the
reporting
requirements
contains
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
no,
it
doesn't
because
congress
says
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that
is
correct.
but
there,
that
showed
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
in
marchetti
and
grosso
particularly,
however
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
in
haynes,
there
was,
again
there
was
a
$200
tax.
in
haynes,
we're
dealing
only
with
one
particular
requirement
of
the
act
which
clearly
required
people
to
register
if
they
had
a
firearm
of
the
type
described
in
that
statute.
here,
however,
i
think
that
it's
important
to
note
that
all
of
the
disclosure
requirements
are
directed
basically
at
the
legal
industry,
the
legal
marijuana
industry
so
that
legal
use
of
marijuana
would
be
made
public
and
that
the
law
enforcement
officials
could
see
that
the
legal
marijuana
was
not
diverted
-into
illegal
channels.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think
there
was
--
the
only
reason
they
didn't
enact
a
totally
prohibitive
statute
insofar
as
illegal
transactions
were
concerned,
there
was
a
legal
market
for
this
so
they
couldn't
totally
prohibit
it.
but
insofar
as
the
illegal
market
was
concerned,
the
reason
they
chose
to
use
the
prohibitive
tax
form
was
i
think
because
at
the
time
congress
was
concerned
with
the
five,
four
decision
of
this
case
and
the
63
decision
in
nigro
and
doremus
and
they
were
afraid,
unless
the
prohibitive
section
was
not
put
in
terms
of
that
prohibitive
tax,
there
might
be
some
constitutional
problems
with
that.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
what
they
had,
mr.
justice,
in
the
harrison
act
made
all
of
the
--
prohibited
all
the
legitimate
forms
in
dealing
in
the
narcotics
involved
there.
i
think
there
was
some
concern
because
the
close
decision
of
this
court
in
those
cases,
the
fact
that
there
was
a
general
probation
not
formed
in
terms
of
the
tax
created
some
problems.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think,
mr.
justice,
that
what
we
are
asking
the
court
to
do
is
to
look
at
the
reality
of
the
situation,
to
look
at
the
fact
that
since
this
act
was
enacted,
providing
this
$100
tax
on
one
ounce
of
marijuana
that
was
selling
in
the
illicit
market
for
dollar,
no
person
has
ever
applied
to
pay
for
this
tax.
that
the
effect
of
it
was
to
make
it
a
prohibitive
tax.
therefore,
this
court
talked
in
grosso
and
marchetti
of
the
fact
that
the
claim
of
the
fifth
amendment
has
to
be
real
and
appreciable.
so
we
submit
here
that
the
court
has
to
look
at
the
whole
statutory
scheme
in
this
framework.
i
think,
from
that
examination,
it
appears
here
that
the
claim
of
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
is
not
real
and
substantial,
but
rather
a
fanciful
and
imaginary
claim
which
petitioner
came
up
with
after
the
fact
in
an
attempt
to
excuse
his
clear
violation
of
federal
law.
and,
so
for
that
reason
we
feel
that
the
contention
of
fifth
amendment
privilege
here
should
be
rejected
by
this
court.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think
it
would
be
the
same
except
that
we
would
not
have
his
testimony
relied
on.
i
think
we
do
have
a
lawyer's
construction
of
the
act.
the
counsel
yesterday
said
that
the
government's
construction
here
was
an
imaginative
one
and
suggested
it
was
something
novel.
here
is
a
lawyer
looking
at
the
act
and
construes
it
in
the
same
way
we
did
before
the
issue
was
ever
raised.
i
think
it's
somewhat
persuasive
in
that
standpoint.
i
think
two,
it
goes
to
the
reality
of
the
situation
of
the
fact
that
this
act,
everybody
recognized,
prohibits
people
who
could
not
handle
marijuana
legally
from
doing
so.
the
practical
effect
of
it
is
the
total
bar.
and
for
that
reason,
the
claim
of
fifth
amendment
privilege
is
really
a
fanciful
one
which
we
submit
was
constructed
after
the
fact
and
not
the
true
motivating
reason
that
the
petitioner
did
not
attempt
to
comply
with
the
act.
