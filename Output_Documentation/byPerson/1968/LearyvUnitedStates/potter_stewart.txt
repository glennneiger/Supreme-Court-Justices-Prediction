justice

stewart
i
missed
the
statement
you
just
made
from
that
of
smoker.
justice
potter
stewart
where
is
the
difficulty
in
this
case
mr.
haft
if
understand
the
record
is
that
according
to
the
defendant's
own
testimony,
he
did
import
this
marihuana
from
mexico
into
the
united
states.
he
had
it
in
his
pocket
so
he
said
when
he
went
to
mexico
and
stayed
there,
when
he
came
back
and
--
so
in
this
case,
there's
no
real
question
of
its
being
imported,
is
there?.
justice
potter
stewart
yeah.
justice
potter
stewart
oh,
practically
not
but
he
had
–
he
had
gone
to
texas
and
hadn't
he
headed
to
mexico.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
but
it
wasn't
and
according
to
his
own
testimony
as
i
understand
it,
you
tell
me
if
i
misunderstand
the
record,
i
haven't
read
it
totally.
the
marihuana
that
was
found
was
taken
on
this
trip
across
the
bridge
and
then
back
across
the
bridge
from
first
to
mexico
and
then
back
into
the
state
of
texas
in
the
united
states.
justice
potter
stewart
so
then
it
was
--
justice
potter
stewart
maybe
there
wasn't
smuggling,
i
mean,
maybe
there
wasn't
meant
for
smuggling.
but
the
facts
according
to
his
own
testimony
did
show
importation,
did
they
not?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
not
in
the
--
(voice
overlap)
justice
potter
stewart
it's
in
the
original
record?
justice
potter
stewart
alright.
justice
potter
stewart
also,
they
were
acting
they
thought
under
their
power
to
tax,
under
their
taxing
power.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that's
the
power
under
which
the
earlier
narcotics
federal
legislation
had
been
upheld.
so
they
were
not
purporting
to
prohibit
anything.
they
were
purporting
to
simply
be
exercising
their
power
to
tax
as
