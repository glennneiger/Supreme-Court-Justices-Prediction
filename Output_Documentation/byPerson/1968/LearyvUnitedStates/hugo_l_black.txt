justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
a
question.
suppose
instead
of
writing
this
law
in
the
nature
of
a
presumption,
i'm
talking
about
a
legal
presumption,
congress
had
said
that
in
any
case
in
any
court
in
this
country
where
a
man
is
charged
with
the
crimes
of
having
in
his
possession
marihuana
imported
from
abroad
that
need
no
--
that
need
be
no
proof
to
convince
the
jury
that
it
came
in
from
abroad
but
he
can
be
convicted
without
proof.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what's
the
difference
in
that
and
this?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
talking
about
what
the
court
said
before.
what's
the
difference
on
those
before?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
can
congress
tell
a
jury
what
evidence
is
sufficient
for
it
to
have
to
bring
about
a
conviction?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
if
suppose
it
says
you
can
convict
without
evidence?
justice
hugo
l.
black
should
be
presumed
because
it
does.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
agree
to
that,
but
i
never
quite
understood
how
you
could
take
the
congress
to
take
one
element
of
a
crime
of
--
an
essential
element
and
say
that
without
any
proof
whatever,
now,
i'm
not
talking
about
jury
drawing
inference,
but
without
any
inferences,
evidence
whatever
which
a
man
can
draw,
if
a
jury
can
draw
an
inference
that
the
man
committed
this
essential
element.
the
jury
is
hereby
authorized
by
the
congress
to
convict.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
then
it
depends
on
the
rationality
connection
altogether,
it
depends
on
the
question
of
which
has
the
right
to
determine
that
the
evidence
is
sufficient
to
support
a
conviction,
the
jury
or
the
court
or
the
legislature?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
it
here,
but
i'm
drawing
that
into
question.
