number

timothy
f.
leary,
petitioner
versus
united
states.
mr.
haft.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
martin?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
i
--
you
said
that
the
outset
mr.
martin
that
you're
going
to
address
yourself
to
the
presumption.
now,
does
that
statute
there
directly
on
presumption
or
upon
the
guilt
possession?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
the
thing
--
the
thing
that
i
didn't
get
is
what
language
in
there
in
that
statute
that
you've
read
says
that
it
is
a
presumption
that
it
was
illegally
imported?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
conviction
of
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
that
is
the
section
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yeah.
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
a
man
was
arrested
in
his
own
field
of
marihuana
and
the
government
charge
him
and
added
the
--
added
account
for
illegal
importation
and
he
stood
mute,
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
suppose
it
was
a
half
mile
away?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you're
charged
with
marihuana
you
do
as
they
do
in
practically
all
this
cases,
they
charge
him
with
the
presumption
also.
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
he
have
to
--
would
he
have
to
take
the
stand
there
and
disapprove
that
he
had
imported
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
would
it
make
any
difference
and
to
the
government
on
presumption?
what
parts
of
the
country
a
man
was
arrested
in,
whether
it
was
part
of
the
country
where
marihuana
is
customarily
grown
or
whether
it
was
in
some
other
part
where
it
couldn't
be
grown?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
it
was
--
because
the
government
finds
--
does
the
government
feel
any
necessity
of
proving
those
things,
all
of
it.
all
it
proves
is
a
man
had
it
in
his
possession
and
it
also
charges
of
count
of
importation,
then
the
question
is
has
the
government
in
just
proving
that
he
has
a
possession
without
proving
the
relationship
to
growers
in
this
country
of
marihuana,
does
that
put
him
to
the
test
of
proving
that
it
was
not
imported?
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no.

mr.

fifth
amendment
rights

what
happens
at
preliminaries
in
the

or
by

happens
at
the
trial?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
martin,
if
this
man
had
not
taken
the
stand,
would
your
argument
be
the
same
concerning
those
excerpts
from
the
records
you
just
read
us?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.

chief

you
may
share
his
time
if
he
is
willing.
