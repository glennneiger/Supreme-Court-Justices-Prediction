mr.
martin,
i
beg
your
pardon.
is
there
any
official
study
to
which
we
could
refer
showing
estimating
the
amount
of
marihuana
that's
imported
here
as
compared
with
the
domestically,
that
the
amount
domestically
grown
or
--
justice
abe
fortas
broken
down
as
to
uses.
is
there
any
study
by
any
agency?
justice
abe
fortas
where'd
he
--
did
he
give
any
basis
for
that
other
than
his
own
wisdom?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that
contrary
to
what
we
just
heard
as
i
understood
it.
your
adversary
said
that
you
couldn't
tell
by
analysis
of
the
marihuana
whether
it
was
domestic
or
imported,
perhaps
i
misunderstood
it.
justice
abe
fortas
but
the
trouble
something
point
here
to
me
is
that
the
--
as
i
understand
this
record,
the
trial
judge
in
the
present
case
would
not
permit
expert
evidence
on
this
subject?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
there's
a
lots
of
other
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that's
another
explanation
of
those
figures
though
obviously
that
is
to
say
these
maybe
indicate
not
an
increase
in
importation
but
increase
in
seizures.
it
may
also
indicate
a
--
an
enormous
increase
in
total
consumption
--
justice
abe
fortas
in
terms
of
percentage
which
what
we're
talking
about
here
is
what
is
the
percentage
of
marihuana
that
is
possessed
in
the
country
and
how
its
broken
down,
how
that
percentage
is
attributable
to
imported
or
domestically
grown
marihuana?
justice
abe
fortas
perhaps,
unfortunately,
congress
didn't
set
the
statute
up
that
way.
congress
set
this
up
as
if
it
were
serious
and
as
if
a
person
who
wanted
the
product
for
certain
uses
could
get
a
permit
upon
--
and
pay
a
$100
tax
and
you're
asking
us
to
say
that
congress
was
just
fooling
in
what
it
really
--
and
what
this
really
is,
is
a
statute
that
prohibits
the
use
of
marijuana
except
of
the
dollar
an
ounce
purposes?
justice
abe
fortas
and
you
use
this
–
do
you
use
this
as
a
distinction
between
marchetti
and
grosso?
justice
abe
fortas
in
other
words,
you
say
that
because
the
tax
here
is
such
a
great
amount
on
the
$100
users
that
we
are
to
look
at
it
as
if
congress,
instead
of
going
through
the
ritual
of
the
taxing
machinery
and
prohibited
the-
transfer,
possession
or
transportation
of
marijuana
except
for
the
dollar
an
ounce
purposes?
justice
abe
fortas
and
that
so
construed,
you
say
that
this
is
different
from
marchetti
and
the
grosso
because
in
marchetti
and
grosso
anybody
could
apply
and
there
was
no
distinction
in
the
amount
of
the
tax.
justice
abe
fortas
doesn't
that
cut
against
your
point?
justice
abe
fortas
because
in
marchetti
and
grosso,
the
entire
industry
so
called
was
an
illegitimate
one?
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
that
would
have
been
prohibitive.
what
they
wanted
to
do
in
marchetti
and
grosso
was
to
prohibit
everybody
from
using,
possessing
or
transferring
or
whatever
it
was
that
kind
of
firearm
and
here
they
wanted
to
prohibit
only
some.
justice
abe
fortas
i
beg
your
pardon.
i
was
talking
about
haynes.
justice
abe
fortas
apart
from
--
is
there
any
reason
-why
congress
did
not
enact
a
prohibitory
statute
other
than
tradition
and
bureaucratic
claims
on
this
particular
activity?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
and
you
are
asking
us
to
construe
this
as
a
--
look
at
this
as
if
it
were
something
that
congress
avoided,
and
you
say
congress
avoided
it
because
of
constitutional
doubts
as
well
as
because
treasury's
claim
as
of
that
time
for
this
highly
priced
jurisdiction
i
suppose
depended
upon
its
exercising
the
taxing
power?
justice

how

cigarettes

they
call
