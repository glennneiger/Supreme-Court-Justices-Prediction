mr.
robert
haft
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
that
persons
have
not
sort
to
apply
for
written
order
form
or
to
pay
the
tax
because
the
statute
is
so
blatantly
self-incriminatory
that
it
would
only
be
a
mad
man
who
would
come
to
the
government
and
seek
to
fill
out
this
order
form.
i
have
read
during
the
course
of
my
argument
the
testimony
of
petitioner
during
the
trial,
that's
at
pages
86,
87
and
89
where
he
specifically
said
that
he
feared
incrimination.
the
part
of
the
motion
which
the
government
has
read,
i
think
that
they
have
left
out
the
very
point,
it
was
raised
on
page
651
of
the
transcript.
the
court
erred
in
not
dismissing
or
granting
a
judgment
of
acquittal
as
to
the
tax
count
because
such
tax
requirement
violates
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
it
was
raised
at
the
district
court
level.
the
petitioner
specifically
testified
as
to
his
very
real
fear
of
the
incrimination
in
the
portions
that
i
read
yesterday.
mr.
robert
haft
i
don't
know,
mr.
justice
fortas.
i
think
the
figure
that
i
used
yesterday
was
one
pound
yielded
1700
cigarettes;
so
that's
roughly
a
100
cigarettes
an
ounce.
mr.
robert
haft
yes.
that's
the
--
proper
legal
tax
would
be
a
dollar
on
the
$100
an
ounce.
i
think
what
the
government
is
in
essence
asking
here
is
that
because
congress
perhaps,
having
doubts
about
the
constitutionality
of
an
outright
prohibition
and
because
they
wrote
on
a
expressly
tax
measure
rather
than
a
prohibitory
measure,
if
this
court
feels
that
a
prohibitory
measure
is
constitutional,
this
court
ought
to
go
ahead
and
rewrite
the
legislation.
that
is
-is
completely
the
wrong
position.
going
back
to
the
presumption
point
of
yesterday,
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
stewart's
question
as
to
other
adequate
evidence
of
guilt
which
there
clearly
was,
i
pointed
out
that
under
the
court's
decision
in
the
united
states
against
romano,
it
would
be
sustained;
that
my
position
would
be
sustained.
in
addition,
i'd
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
on
pages
102
to
104
of
the
record,
in
the
charge
to
the
jury,
the
district
judge
in
practical
effect
limited
the
entire
case
to
the
trip
from
new
york
to
texas
on
the
admission
of
acquisition
by
the
defendant
plus
the
statutory
presumption
and
that's
little
of
the
case
on
the
return
back.
i
think
the
charge
is
very
clear.
it
points
almost
exclusively
to
that
one
theory.
in
the
-last
minute,
i
would
like
to
make
an
application,
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
next
case,
the
covington
case
raises
just
the
tax
issue.
we
do
feel
and
counsel
for
covington
does
and
the
government
does
not
object,
if
the
court
pleases,
we
do
feel
that
the
bulk
of
the
argument
on
the
taxing
statute
will
come
during
the
covington
argument
and
counsel
for
covington
is
agreeable
for
permitting
counsel
for
leary
to
have
some
part
of
his
time
in
arguing
the
further
parts
of
the
marijuana
tax
act.
it
would
please
the
court,
we
would
like
to
split
the
argument
to
some
extent
on
the
covington
case.
mr.
robert
haft
thank
you.
