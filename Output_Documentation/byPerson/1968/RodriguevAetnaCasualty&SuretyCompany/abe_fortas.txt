justice
abe
fortas
i
wonder
if
your
--
how
far
you'd
carry
that.
suppose
20
miles
out
at
sea
from
the
coast
of
louisiana
but
on
a
direct
line.
justice
abe
fortas
say,
disaster
occurred
and
there
was
a
death
on
the
high
seas
at
that
point.
justice
abe
fortas
no,
not
an
island
at
all,
just
a
collision
or
a
ship
or
something
of
the
sort
having
nothing
to
do
with
the
continental
shelf,
way
outside
of
the
continental
shelf,
would
you
say
that
death
on
the
high
seas
act
at
the
effect
of
giving
cause
of
action
also
in
the
louisiana
law?
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that.
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
talking
only
about
the
argument
you've
been
making
here
with
respect
to
the
death
on
this
high
seas
act.
justice
abe
fortas
no,
on
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act.
you
say
that
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
expressly
reserves
state
causes
of
action.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i'm
asking
you
whether
that
would
apply
in
the
circum
--
in
the
situation
i
put
to
you
without
--
far
beyond
the
outer
continental
shelf.
there
is
death
on
the
high
seas
and
somebody
claims
a
remedy,
and
the
louisiana
law
is
saying
that
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
saves
remedies
under
the
state
law
and
this
death
occurred
on
a
direct
projected
line
from
the
middle
of
the
state
of
louisiana
and,
therefore,
we
--
the
contention
is
that
we
have
a
cause
of
action
in
louisiana
laws.
justice
abe
fortas
it's
essential
for
you
to
demonstrate
not
only
that
there
is
a
possibility
under
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act,
but
also
that
the
outer
continental
shelf
act
does
provide
for
the
alternative
applicability
of
louisiana
law.
justice
abe
fortas
alright,
i
don't
care
what
you
call
it.
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
right?
so,
you've
got
--
justice
abe
fortas
in
other
words,
you've
got
to
show
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
you've
got
to
show
that
this
--
that
louisiana
has
jurisdiction
by
reason
of
the
place
where
this
act
--
this
death
occurred.
justice
abe
fortas
legislative
history
of
a
death
on
the
high
seas
act?
justice
abe
fortas
[inaudible]
justice
abe
fortas
well,
may
i
direct
your
attention
a
bit
more
specifically
to
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act
in
section
1331
(a)
(2).
now,
merely
a
reading
of
that,
i
suppose
it's
at
least
arguable
hat
after
the
enactment
of
that
probation,
the
federal
law
applicable
to
a
tort
or
committed
on
the
high
--
one
of
these
artificial
islands
on
the
outer
continental
shelf.
the
federal
law
would
include
not
only
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act,
but
also
such
legislation
of
the
state
of
louisiana
relating
to
this
tort,
as
is
not
inconsistent
with
death
on
the
high
seas
act,
isn't
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
and
so,
you
get
down
to
the
question
of
whether
the
louisiana
laws
in
question
here,
that
is
to
say
louisiana
laws
providing
for
recovery
in
the
case
of
wrongful
death
not
only
for
pecuniary
loss
but
also
for
loss
of
affection,
consorting,
or
whatever
it
may
be.
whether
those
louisiana
laws
are
inconsistent
with
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
and
that's
the
--
that,
i
take
it,
is
the
issue
before
us
because
if
we
find
--
if
we
should
conclude
that
the
louisiana
tort
law,
in
the
respect
that
i
have
stated,
is
not
inconsistent
with
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
then,
by
virtue
of
1331
(a)
(2),
that
louisiana
law
is
incorporated
into
the
federal
law
and
becomes
a
federal
law
available
to
these
petitioners,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that's
your
argument
in
this
trial.
that's
your
submission
and
your
adversary
says
the
opposite,
1331
(a)
(2)
does
not
specifically
refer
to
those
two
preconditions,
as
you
would
have
us
construe
them
to
be.
justice
abe
fortas
sir,
i
know
your
time
is
up,
but
i
want
to
follow
the
chief
justice's
question
to
you
--
justice
abe
fortas
by
this
question.
please
assume
with
me
for
the
moment
that
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
provided
a
remedy
for
all
of
these
factors,
that
is
to
say
not
only
for
loss,
pecuniary
loss,
direct
pecuniary
loss,
but
also
for
loss
of
consorting,
love,
affection,
and
whatnot
just
as
louisiana
law
does.
please
make
that
assumption.
but,
let
us
suppose
that
the
louisiana
law
fixed
a
higher
limit
on
the
aggregate
recovery.
now,
would
you
say
that
the
louisiana
law
was
still
available
to
you
or,
in
those
circumstances,
would
you
agree
that
the
federal
law
--
and
that
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
and
the
louisiana
state
law
are
inconsistent
within
the
meaning
of
the
continental
shelfs
act?
justice
abe
fortas
why?
now,
how
would
you
explain
that?
justice
abe
fortas
i
suppose
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
let
me
ask
you
this.
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
let
me
ask
you
his
quickly.
suppose
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
said,
expressly,
“there
shall
be
no
recovery
for
any
of
--
for
any
damages
whatsoever
of
any
kind
or
nature
as
a
result
of
wrongful
death,
and
let's
suppose
the
louisiana
statute
did
provide
a
remedy.
would
you
say
that
those
two
are
inconsistent?
justice
abe
fortas
if
i
turn
to
the
latter,
it's
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
i
wonder
if
your
--
how
far
you'd

that.
