justice

white
what
was
the
question
of
my
brother
brennan?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
know
about
this?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
that's
only
as
federal
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
makes
the
federal
law
of
louisiana
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
doesn't
give
it
--
louisiana
any
jurisdiction
over
the
outer
continental
shelf.
justice
byron
r.
white
nor
does
(inaudible)
louisiana
law
talks
only
as
a
--
justice
byron
r.
white
does
the
longshoremen's
act
apply
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
why?
justice
byron
r.
white
doesn't
the
continental
shelf
act
say
--
refer
specifically
to
the
longshoremen's
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
see.
justice
byron
r.
white
this
is
a--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
would
have
been
the
situation
if
these
people
had
not
been
killed
but
only
injured?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
would've
been
under
the
continental
shelf
act,
wouldn't
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
all
it
says
is
--
it
says,
for
the
purposes
of
--
on
these
artificial
islands,
the
federal
law
is
the
state
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
--
but
the
continental
shelf
act
says
that
a
matter
of
--
as
a
matter
of
federal
law,
the
state
law
will
apply
--
justice
byron
r.
white
two
injuries
on
these
artificial
islands.
justice
byron
r.
white
except
where
there's
some
other
federal
law
that's
applicable.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
alright.
if
the
--
except
where
there's
some
conflicting
federal
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
and,
you
are
--
are
you
suggesting
that
the
high
seas
act
is
not
in
conflict
with
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
louisiana
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
mean
either
one
of
them
applies
that
would
permit
recovery
and,
therefore,
they're
not
in
conflict?
justice
byron
r.
white
either
they
--
either
any
law
--
you
can
apply
any
part
of
any
law
as
long
as
it
allows
recovery.
justice
byron
r.
white
does
louisiana
law
bar
for
contributory
negligence?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
the
high
seas
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
that
not
a
conflict
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
you'd
apply
the
high
seas
act
in
that
respect.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
want
the
recovery
of
the
“for
pain
and
suffering”
under
louisiana
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
i
understand
--
are
you
claiming
a
right
of
recovery
under
both
statutes?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
other
words
then,
you'd
--
i
take
it
that
it
has
to
be
on
the
basic
issue
of
negligence.
it
would
have
to
be
a
determination
of
the
issue
of
negligence
under
both
statutes,
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
one
by
the
judge
in
admiralty,
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
could
be?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
other
would
be
by
a
jury.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
which
comes
first
and
are
you
concluded
if
there's
a
finding
against
you
in
negligence,
say,
by
the
judge
under
the
high
seas
act,
does
that
throw
you
out
of
court
on
the
second?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
dore
case
the
higa
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
higa
case,
is
that
the
dore
--
would
you
call
the
dore
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
but,
there's
that
--
but
there's
an
earlier
decision.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
your
action
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
your
action
in
--
your
action
would,
in
either
case,
so
be
for
negligence.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
see,
in
your
case,
which
is
different
than
between
the
jones
act
and
unseaworthiness,
completely
different
situation.
you
have
a
different
cause
of
action.
here,
you're
claiming
that
you
have
to
have
cause
of
action
for
negligence
in
admiralty
and
you
have
a
cause
of
action
for
negligence
under
the
louisiana
law.
now,
would
you
say
that
if
we
decided
contrary
to
your
view
that,
under
the
continental
--
that
within
the
meaning
of
the
continental
shelf
act,
the
louisiana
law
is
in
conflict
with
the
federal
law,
namely
the
high
seas
act,
that
you
have
lost
your
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
understand
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that.
you're
just
again
arguing
that
it
isn't
in
conflict.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
that's
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you've
lost
your
case
in
spite
of
the
reservation
in
the
high
seas
act.
justice
byron
r.
white
which
was
--
which
came
first,
the
death
on
the
high
seas
or
the
continental
shelf
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
under
the
high
seas
act,
while
there
--
and
before
the
continental
shelf
act,
there
was
a
limited
applicability
of
state
law,
wasn't
there?
with
the
coming
--
the
continental
shelf
act,
certainly,
that
act
set
federal
laws
to
apply
on
the
high
seas
or
in
these
islands
--
on
these
artificial
islands,
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
no
state
law.
i
mean,
no
state
law
as
state
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
only
state
law
as
federal
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
state
law
was
put
aside
and
the
--
that
act
said
that
if
there's
a
federal
act
that
is
in
conflict
with
the
state
law,
well,
it
would
be
the
federal
statute
that
would
apply.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
would
you
--
are
you
arguing
that
the
savings
clause
then
in
the
high
seas
act
is,
in
effect,
repealed
or
set
aside
by
the
continental
shelf
act
insofar
as
the
--
these
artificial
islands
are
concerned?
that's
the
effect
of
your
argument,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron

white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
and,
i
thought
your
--
a
hearing
of
that,
that
the
continental
shelf
act
made
the
federal
law
the
exclusive
source
causes
of
action
or
injury
on
those
islands.
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
it's
federal
law
all
the
way.
they
may
borrow
some
state
law,
but
it's
still
federal
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
wouldn't
that
be
