mr.
james
e.
diaz
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i'm
james
diaz
from
lafayette,
louisiana,
representing
two
of
the
--
one
of
the
respondents
in
these
two
consolidated
cases.
i
represent
link
belt
company
and
the
road
equipment
company.
mr.
richard
baldwin,
sited,
and
mr.
james
blazek,
sited
at
the
counsel
table
with
me,
represents
the
respondents
in
the
budrow
rodrigue
case
where
a
ruben
merion,
a
citizen
of
louisiana,
doing
business
as
merion
drilling
company,
it's
ensure,
and
humble
oil
company.
i
also
feel
a
sense
of
responsibility
of
representing
the
two
federal
district
court
judges,
judge
ainsworth
as
the
organ
of
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
both
of
these
cases
whose
decisions
are
here
for
review
and
who
does
not
have
an
opportunity
here
today
of
defending
the
reviews.
these
louisiana-trained
federal
--
mr.
james
e.
diaz
yes,
your
honor.
i
prepared
my
argument
here
today
in
a
little
different
prospective
that
i
had
argued
it
in
my
brief,
and
i
wanted
to
present
this
to
you
as
a
visual
aid
in
following
the
argument
which
i
am
making
here
today.
it
is
merely
as
a
visual
aid
of
whatever
benefit
it
may
be
to
the
court.
mr.
james
e.
diaz
no,
your
honor,
it's
merely
an
outline
of
my
argument
here
today
which
varies
in
perspective
from
the
argument
i
presented
in
my
written
brief.
mr.
james
e.
diaz
yes,
your
honor.
yes,
sir.
now,
your
honor,
in
connection
with
the
submerged
lands
act
--
mr.
james
e.
diaz
i
apologize
if
i
was
out
of
order,
your
honor.
i
merely
meant
it
as
a
visual
aid
as
a
benefit
to
the
court.
mr.
james
e.
diaz
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
e.
diaz
thank
you,
chief
justice.
i
may
point
out
at
this
time,
sir,
that
i
use
the
term
“submerged
lands
act”
because
that
is
the
title
which
the
united
states
court
annotated
as
of
the
top
of
this
section
1333
which
i
understood
it
to
be
the
popular
name
as
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act.
i
maybe
in
error
on
that,
justice
stewart,
and
i
wish
to
state
though
that
my
argument
here
is
with
reference
to
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act.
mr.
james
e.
diaz
your
honor,
i
believe
that
was
enacted
in
1948,
sir.
mr.
james
e.
diaz
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
james
e.
diaz
now,
what
are
these
louisiana-trained
judges
hold?
they
held
that
on
deaths
occurring
on
stationary
platforms,
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
is
the
applicable
law.
it's
the
federal
dispositive
law.
that
where
there
is
federal
dispositive
law,
the
state
law
cannot
apply
and
is
superseded,
and
thirdly,
that
the
state
law,
the
elements
of
the
cause
of
action
provided
by
the
wrongful
death
action
of
the
state
of
louisiana,
those
elements
are
inconsistent
with
the
elements
of
the
cause
of
action
provided
under
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act.
the
issue
here
before
us
is
narrowed
down
to
the
question
as
to
whether
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
which
restricts
recovery
to
pecuniary
loss
can
be
supplemented
by
the
law
on
the
adjacent
state.
before
proceeding
to
give
a
little
more
detail
--
mr.
james
e.
diaz
yes,
your
honor,
that
is
a
correlative
issue.
in
the
rodrigue
--
i
would
like
to
mention,
in
the
rodrigue
case,
there
were
two
civil
actions
filed
and
there
was
an
admiralty
action
filed.
the
two
civil
actions
were
dismissed
by
a
motion
to
dismiss
by
judge
west,
and
those
are
the
only
two
decisions
which
are
here
before
the
court
today.
the
admiralty
action
was
tried
on
the
merits
and
judgment
was
rendered
in
favor
of
the
plaintiff
on
pecuniary
loss,
and
that
action
is
not
before
the
court
here
today.
now,
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
budrow
rodrgue
case
as
it
affirmed
the
dore
cases.
these
two
cases
have
in
common
the
fact
that
both
occurred
on
the
outer
continental
shelf
or
the
marine
league
from
shore
and
the
actions
are
both
against
third
parties
non-employers.
the
plaintiffs'
attorney
has
attempted
to
use
two
avenues
by
which
to
incorporate
the
state
law,
that
those
two
avenues
are
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act
and
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act.
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act
provides,
as
set
forth
on
page
7
and
8
of
our
brief
in
division
(a)
(1),
that
the
laws
applicable
to
these
artificial
islands
are
as
the
--
are
the
federal
constitutions
--
the
federal
constitution
and
the
federal
laws.
it
then
provides
that,
to
the
extent
that
the
state
law
is
applicable
and
to
the
extent
that
the
state
law
is
not
inconsistent,
then
the
state
laws
may
be
applied.
and,
it
also
provides
that
the
executive
department
of
the
united
states
is
to
define
by
extending
theoretical
boundaries
into
the
ocean
what
adjacent
laws
are
to
be
applied.
up
to
my
knowledge,
the
executive
department
has
not
projected
that
the
state
boundary
is
out
into
the
ocean
and
not
into
the
gulf
of
mexico.
insofar
as
the
submerged
lands
act
which
unquestionably
applies
here,
the
plaintiffs'
attorney,
in
order
to
have
the
state
law
adopted
as
a
federal
law,
must
meet
these
three
requirements.
the
first
requirement
is,
does
the
state
law
apply?
one
of
the
first
things
that
i'm
learning
of
constitutional
law
is
that
where
there
is
federal
legislation
in
a
field
that
the
federal
legislature
is
competent
to
legislate
upon,
it
supersedes
those
state
laws
which
had
been
previously
incorporated
by
federal
law
in
order
to
provide
a
remedy.
this
court,
in
lynn
grennan
--
the
lynn
grennan
case
and
also
in
the
glasby
versus
united
states
steel
corporation
case,
in
which
justice
black
was
the
organ
of
the
court,
there,
reiterated
the
principle
that
where
the
federal
legislature
has
preempted
the
field
previously
occupied
by
state
law
and
can
competently
do
so,
then,
the
state
law
is
superseded.
now,
the
lynn
grennan
case
is
very
applicable
to
this
case
at
bar
because,
in
that
case,
a
seaman
was
killed
as
a
result
of
an
accident
which
occurred
in
virginia
waters.
and,
he
was
survived
only
by
a
niece
and
a
nephew
who
were
not
dependent
upon
the
seaman.
the
plaintiffs'
attorney
stated
that
he
had
the
right
to
recover
for
general
damages
under
the
virginia
wrongful
death
action
as
a
supplementary
law
to
the
jones
act,
which
is
exactly
what
is
being
argued
here.
in
the
lynn
grennan
decision,
the
united
states
supreme
court
held
that
the
jones
act
that'd
been
legislated
in
order
to
provide
this
field
of
law
previously
covered
by
state
ter
--
by
state
law
and,
therefore,
that
the
jones
act
superseded
the
wrongful
death
action
even
to
the
extent
of
ruling
out
general
damages.
34
years
later,
this
court
in
the
glasby
again
affirmed
the
lynn
grennan
decision,
but
separate
and
apart
from
the
general
field
of
federal
preemption
is
a
question
that
there
are
three
decisions
by
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
which
are
the
loffland
brothers
versus
roberts,
ocean
drilling
and
exploration
company
versus
berry
brothers,
and
pure
oil
company
versus
snipes
cited
on
page
9
of
our
brief.
in
which,
the
first
circuit
has
held,
and
this
court
has
approved
since
writs
of
certiorari
were
denied
in
each
one
of
these
cases,
has
held
that
on
the
outer
continental
shelf
under
section
(a)
(1)
of
title
1333
--
of
section
1333,
it
is
a
federal
maritime
law
that
is
to
apply
to
personal
injury
litigation
and
that
the
state
law
has
no
application
whatsoever.
so
that,
in
personal
injury
litigation,
insofar
as
the
stationary
platforms,
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act,
as
adopting
federal
maritime
law,
governs.
therefore,
the
state
law
apply?
the
state
law
does
not
apply
because
it
has
been
superseded
by
the
federal
death
on
the
high
seas
act.
even
if
this
court
were
to
hold
that
state
law
is
to
apply,
the
second
requirement
written
into
the
submer
--
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act
is
that
the
state
law,
before
it
can
be
adopted,
has
to
be
consistent
with
federal
laws
then
existing.
now,
i
have
set
forth
in
this
visual
aid,
as
i
did
in
my
memorandum,
as
to
a
comparison
of
the
various
elements
of
the
causes
of
action
provided
under
the
louisiana
law
and
under
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act,
the
beneficiaries
are
different,
the
damages
are
different.
now,
the
plaintiffs'
attorney
says
that
there
is
a
hiatus
in
this
particular
field
of
law
because
no
general
damages
are
provided
by
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act.
i
submit
to
you
that
the
legislature
in
1920,
the
legislature
that
enacted
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act,
specifically
contemplated
the
granting
of
general
damages.
judge
putnam
--
chief
justice
putnam
of
new
york,
who
was
the
author
of
the
bill,
provided
in
his
original
letter
to
the
congress
that
the
damages
were
for
fair
and
just
compensation.
in
1914,
the
legislative
judicial
committee
modified
--
qualified
that
language
by
saying
that
it
was
restricted
to
pecuniary
loss
and
this
concept
of
restricting
damages
to
pecuniary
loss
is
not
only
applicable
in
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act,
but
in
the
companion
case
of
the
jones
act
which
was
enacted
by
the
same
legislature
in
1920.
i
therefore
submit
to
you
that
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
is
--
does
not
provide
an
incomplete
remedy
for
damages.
it
compli
--
it
provides
for
the
complete
remedy
as
intended
by
the
legislature,
so
that
there
is
no
hiatus.
therefore,
the
two-principle
requirements
of
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act
for
the
adoption
of
state
law,
first,
its
application
of
state
law
and,
secondly,
the
fact
that
the
state
law
cannot
be
inconsistent,
it
had
not
been
complied
with
in
this
case
and,
therefore,
the
state
law
has
no
application
whatsoever.
mr.
james
e.
diaz
yes,
your
honor.
i'm
coming
to
that
that
is
the
second
avenue
that
the
plaintiffs'
attorney
has
sought
to
use
the
wrongful
death
act
of
louisiana.
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
legislative
history
shows
that
they
intended,
at
least
judge
putnam
did,
intended
for
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
to
be
the
exclusive
remedy.
now,
then,
mann
--
mr.
mann
of
illinois,
in
1920,
made
an
amendment
because
he
was
concerned
with
this.
he
says
“what
about
an
illinois
constituent
in
illinois,
does
he
have
to
go
to
new
york
to
a
federal
district
--
foreign
federal
district
court
to
assert
her
remedies?”
he
says
“i
want
to
preserve
to
the
state
courts
their
jurisdiction
under
their
own
laws
for
my
own
constituents
to
proceed
under
a
state
law.”
i
think
that
the
legislative
history
and
the
arguments
that
were
presented
by
the
legislature
in
pages
20
through
23
of
our
brief,
your
honor,
show
that
their
intention
was
not
to
give
concurrent
jurisdiction,
not
to
give
concurrent
remedies,
but
to
give
alternative
remedies.
they
wanted
to
preserve
to
suitors
the
right
to
proceed
in
state
court
under
a
state
court
remedy.
mr.
james
e.
diaz
the
death
on
the
high
seas
was
in
1920,
your
honor,
and
the
submerged
lands
act
was
in
19
--
mr.
james
e.
diaz
that's
correct.
mr.
james
e.
diaz
that
is
correct.
mr.
james
e.
diaz
only
state
law
as
adopted
by
the
federal
law.
mr.
james
e.
diaz
that
is
correct.
mr.
james
e.
diaz
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
and
that's
why
i
say
that
you
need
not
decide
whether
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
is
the
exclusive
remedy
because
this
specific
legislation
on
point
is
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act,
so
that
even
if
the
state
law
could
be
supplemented,
which
we
do
not
but
even
assuming
it
could
be
supplemented
under
death
on
the
high
seas
act,
this
specific
act
in
question,
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act
would
not
permit
it
because
the
state
law
would
be
inconsistent
with
the
applicable
federal
law.
mr.
james
e.
diaz
no
idea,
your
honor,
is
that
the
survivors
of
a
dissident
have
a
right
to
proceed
in
a
federal
forum
under
federal
law
--
mr.
james
e.
diaz
completely,
and
that
--
mr.
james
e.
diaz
and
that
--
mr.
james
e.
diaz
no
state
law
at
all,
your
honor.
that
is
correct.
now,
i
believe
that
is
the
case
on
the
outer
continental
shelf
--
under
--
mr.
james
e.
diaz
the
direct
action
statute
--
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
that
the
direct
action
statute,
first
of
all,
is
at
issue
here
but,
to
answer
your
question
--
mr.
james
e.
diaz
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
of
course,
i
believe
that
the
direct
action
statute
is
inimical
to
maritime
law.
it's
inimical
to
the
limitation
of
liability
concept
and
should
not
be
applied
in
maritime
cases
at
all,
and
these
cases
--
in
this
act,
as
occurring
on
s
--
mr.
james
e.
diaz
your
honor?
mr.
james
e.
diaz
your
honor,
it
has
been
--
excuse
me,
sir.
mr.
james
e.
diaz
it
has
been
applied,
your
honor,
but
what
i
am
saying
here
is
that
it
should
not
be
applied.
mr.
james
e.
diaz
yes,
your
honor.
yes.
mr.
james
e.
diaz
your
honor,
i
--
the
only
way
i
can
answer
that
is
this.
i
was
trained
as
a
lawyer
in
law
school
and
in
practice
to
confine
myself
with
then
the
legisla
--
within
the
legislative
provisions,
and
i
am
saying
--
is
that
the
legislative
provision
here
are
clear
that
the
only
remedy
for
deaths
occurring
on
the
--
under
the
a
--
under
the
intendment
of
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act,
the
only
remedy
is
under
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
exclusive
of
state
law.
mr.
james
e.
diaz
i
have
to
d
--
mr.
james
e.
diaz
yes,
sir,
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act.
mr.
james
e.
diaz
yes,
sir.
well,
you've
got
to
go
to
the
parent
which
is
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act
and
the
parent
adopts
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
you
can
then
--
you
cannot
then
incorporate
under
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act,
the
state
law,
which
you
cannot
do
under
the
adopted
provisions
of
the
outer
continental
shelf.
you
cannot
do
indirectly
what
you
cannot
do
directly
because
if
the
parent
act
is
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act,
then
you
have
to
look
at
that
primarily.
if
you
cannot
incorporate
state
law
under
that
act,
you
certainly
cannot
incorporate
it
under
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
which
itself
is
incorporated
in
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act.
mr.
james
e.
diaz
your
honor,
i
believe
that
the
intention
of
mr.
mann
and
mr.
sanders,
who
were
part
of
the
legis
--
part
of
the
legislature
in
1920,
was
to
allow
suitors
their
ability
to
sue
in
a
state
forum
with
state
laws
wherever
state
laws
have
been
held
to
be
competent,
as
in
the
hamilton.
i
think
a
very
strong
argument
against
--
mr.
james
e.
diaz
as
i
see
the
consequences,
your
honor,
the
survivors
of
a
dissident
would
have
an
alternate
or
elective
course
that
could
either
go
into
federal
forum
with
federal
laws,
substantive
laws,
or
they
could
go
into
a
state
forum
with
state
laws
at
their
election.
mr.
james
e.
diaz
your
honor,
i
am
of
the
opinion
that
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
should
be
given
as
exclusive
remedy,
but
if
we
are
to
give
any
effect
to
section
7
on
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act,
that's
applied,
as
mr.
mann
intended
it,
to
preserve
to
his
constituent
his
reme
--
his
right
to
go
into
a
state
court
with
a
state
court
remedy.
mr.
james
e.
diaz
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
james
e.
diaz
where
there
is
dispositive
federal
law
carrying
the
subject
matter.
mr.
james
e.
diaz
i
see
what
you
mean.
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
e.
diaz
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
e.
diaz
i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
i
didn't
mean
--
mr.
james
e.
diaz
he
--
i
had
understood
his
question
as
to
the
interpretation
of
section
7
of
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
outside
of
the
contents
of
the
outer
continental
shelf.
mr.
james
e.
diaz
that's
what
i
was
arguing
there.
those
are
my
--
my
position
is
that
the
application
of
state
law
in
this,
insofar
as
injuries
occurring
on
the
stationery
platform,
that
the
application
of
state
law
is
inimical
to
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act
and,
therefore,
cannot
be
applied.
mr.
james
e.
diaz
that's
correct.
mr.
james
e.
diaz
that's
right.
mr.
james
e.
diaz
that
is
correct.
mr.
james
e.
diaz
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
e.
diaz
justice
fortas,
i
agree
with
you
in
part,
but
i
think
that
section
(a)
(2)
has
two
conditions
precedent.
one
is
that
there
is
no
federal
dispositive
law
on
the
subject
matter
and,
secondly,
that
if
there
is
no
federal
dispositive
law,
then
state
law
may
be
used
provided
it
is
not
inconsistent
with
other
federal
laws.
mr.
james
e.
diaz
that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
i
am
saying
that
i
--
that
the
fifth
circuit
also
held
that
on
the
basis
of
the
berry
brothers
and
the
pure
oil
versus
snipes
that
here
were
two
conditions
precedent
that
had
to
be
met.
as
an
alternative
argument,
your
honors,
as
i
said
in
my
--
my
principle
position
is
that
the
state
law
cannot
be
applied
whatsoever
under
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act.
but,
as
an
alternate
argument,
if
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
does
allow
a
supplemental
remedy,
i
submit
to
you
that
the
case
cited
by
opposing
counsel,
the
higa
versus
transocean
which
he
says
is
in
his
favor,
supports
our
proposition
here
because,
in
higa,
the
court
held,
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
held,
as
affirmed
by
this
court
in
writ
of
certiorari,
that
the
state
law
may
be
applied
only
where
its
own
wrongful
death
act
provisions
give
it
extraterritorial
effect.
if
that
is
the
case,
and
that's
the
case
we're
going
to
follow
here,
i
submit
to
your
honors
that
there
has
been
no
showing
nor
can
there
be
any
that
the
louisiana
wrongful
death
act
does
not
have
any
extraterritorial
effect.
a
counsel,
opposing
counsel
has
cited
the
e.b.
ward,
jr.
and
let
me
say
this
to
you
in
connection
with
that.
the
e.b.
ward,
jr.
does
not
hold
that
louisiana
wrongful
death
act
has
extraterritorial
effect.
the
e.b.
ward,
jr.
held,
at
a
time
when
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
was
not
in
effect,
that
because
of
the
fact
that
the
shelf,
the
e.b.
ward,
was
a
louisiana
shelf,
it
was
louisiana
territory
so
that
it
could
be
governed
by
the
laws
of
the
state
of
louisiana.
in
conclusion,
your
honors,
i
respectfully
request
that
the
decision
of
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
be
affirmed
because
the
controlling
statute
is
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act,
that
there
are
patent
inconsistencies
in
the
state
law
and
in
the
federal
law
as
to
beneficiaries,
statute
of
limitations,
contribution
among
joint
tort
fees
and,
as
was
held
by
this
ca
--
by
this
court
in
the
tungus,
you
have
to
take
the
state
law
in
its
entirety
and
not
just
those
parts
of
it
which
benefit
you.
so,
if
we're
going
to
take
this
cause
of
action
provided
under
article
2315,
each
and
every
one
of
those
elements
is
inconsistent
and
contradictory
to
the
elements
of
the
cause
of
action
provided
under
the
death
on
the
highs
seas
act.
mr.
james
e.
diaz
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i'm
james
diaz
from
lafayette,
louisiana,
representing
two
of
the
--
one
of
the
respondents
in
these
two
consolidated
cases.
i
represent
link
belt
company
and
the
road
equipment
company.
mr.
richard
baldwin,
sited,
and
mr.
james
blazek,
sited
at
the
counsel
table
with
me,
represents
the
respondents
in
the
budrow
rodrigue
case
where
a
ruben
merion,
a
citizen
of
louisiana,
doing
business
as
merion
drilling
company,
it's
ensure,
and
humble
oil
company.
i
also
feel
a
sense
of
responsibility
of
representing
the
two
federal
district
court
judges,
judge
ainsworth
as
the
organ
of
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
both
of
these
cases
whose
decisions
are
here
for
review
and
who
does
not
have
an
opportunity
here
today
of
defending
the
reviews.
these
louisiana-trained
federal
--
mr.
james
e.
diaz
yes,
your
honor.
i
prepared
my
argument
here
today
in
a
little
different
prospective
that
i
had
argued
it
in
my
brief,
and
i
wanted
to
present
this
to
you
as
a
visual
aid
in
following
the
argument
which
i
am
making
here
today.
it
is
merely
as
a
visual
aid
of
whatever
benefit
it
may
be
to
the
court.
mr.
james
e.
diaz
no,
your
honor,
it's
merely
an
outline
of
my
argument
here
today
which
varies
in
perspective
from
the
argument
i
presented
in
my
written
brief.
mr.
james
e.
diaz
yes,
your
honor.
yes,
sir.
now,
your
honor,
in
connection
with
the
submerged
lands
act
--
mr.
james
e.
diaz
i
apologize
if
i
was
out
of
order,
your
honor.
i
merely
meant
it
as
a
visual
aid
as
a
benefit
to
the
court.
mr.
james
e.
diaz
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
e.
diaz
thank
you,
chief
justice.
i
may
point
out
at
this
time,
sir,
that
i
use
the
term
“submerged
lands
act”
because
that
is
the
title
which
the
united
states
court
annotated
as
of
the
top
of
this
section
1333
which
i
understood
it
to
be
the
popular
name
as
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act.
i
maybe
in
error
on
that,
justice
stewart,
and
i
wish
to
state
though
that
my
argument
here
is
with
reference
to
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act.
mr.
james
e.
diaz
your
honor,
i
believe
that
was
enacted
in
1948,
sir.
mr.
james
e.
diaz
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
james
e.
diaz
now,
what
are
these
louisiana-trained
judges
hold?
they
held
that
on
deaths
occurring
on
stationary
platforms,
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
is
the
applicable
law.
it's
the
federal
dispositive
law.
that
where
there
is
federal
dispositive
law,
the
state
law
cannot
apply
and
is
superseded,
and
thirdly,
that
the
state
law,
the
elements
of
the
cause
of
action
provided
by
the
wrongful
death
action
of
the
state
of
louisiana,
those
elements
are
inconsistent
with
the
elements
of
the
cause
of
action
provided
under
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act.
the
issue
here
before
us
is
narrowed
down
to
the
question
as
to
whether
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
which
restricts
recovery
to
pecuniary
loss
can
be
supplemented
by
the
law
on
the
adjacent
state.
before
proceeding
to
give
a
little
more
detail
--
mr.
james
e.
diaz
yes,
your
honor,
that
is
a
correlative
issue.
in
the
rodrigue
--
i
would
like
to
mention,
in
the
rodrigue
case,
there
were
two
civil
actions
filed
and
there
was
an
admiralty
action
filed.
the
two
civil
actions
were
dismissed
by
a
motion
to
dismiss
by
judge
west,
and
those
are
the
only
two
decisions
which
are
here
before
the
court
today.
the
admiralty
action
was
tried
on
the
merits
and
judgment
was
rendered
in
favor
of
the
plaintiff
on
pecuniary
loss,
and
that
action
is
not
before
the
court
here
today.
now,
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
budrow
rodrgue
case
as
it
affirmed
the
dore
cases.
these
two
cases
have
in
common
the
fact
that
both
occurred
on
the
outer
continental
shelf
or
the
marine
league
from
shore
and
the
actions
are
both
against
third
parties
non-employers.
the
plaintiffs'
attorney
has
attempted
to
use
two
avenues
by
which
to
incorporate
the
state
law,
that
those
two
avenues
are
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act
and
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act.
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act
provides,
as
set
forth
on
page
7
and
8
of
our
brief
in
division
(a)
(1),
that
the
laws
applicable
to
these
artificial
islands
are
as
the
--
are
the
federal
constitutions
--
the
federal
constitution
and
the
federal
laws.
it
then
provides
that,
to
the
extent
that
the
state
law
is
applicable
and
to
the
extent
that
the
state
law
is
not
inconsistent,
then
the
state
laws
may
be
applied.
and,
it
also
provides
that
the
executive
department
of
the
united
states
is
to
define
by
extending
theoretical
boundaries
into
the
ocean
what
adjacent
laws
are
to
be
applied.
up
to
my
knowledge,
the
executive
department
has
not
projected
that
the
state
boundary
is
out
into
the
ocean
and
not
into
the
gulf
of
mexico.
insofar
as
the
submerged
lands
act
which
unquestionably
applies
here,
the
plaintiffs'
attorney,
in
order
to
have
the
state
law
adopted
as
a
federal
law,
must
meet
these
three
requirements.
the
first
requirement
is,
does
the
state
law
apply?
one
of
the
first
things
that
i'm
learning
of
constitutional
law
is
that
where
there
is
federal
legislation
in
a
field
that
the
federal
legislature
is
competent
to
legislate
upon,
it
supersedes
those
state
laws
which
had
been
previously
incorporated
by
federal
law
in
order
to
provide
a
remedy.
this
court,
in
lynn
grennan
--
the
lynn
grennan
case
and
also
in
the
glasby
versus
united
states
steel
corporation
case,
in
which
justice
black
was
the
organ
of
the
court,
there,
reiterated
the
principle
that
where
the
federal
legislature
has
preempted
the
field
previously
occupied
by
state
law
and
can
competently
do
so,
then,
the
state
law
is
superseded.
now,
the
lynn
grennan
case
is
very
applicable
to
this
case
at
bar
because,
in
that
case,
a
seaman
was
killed
as
a
result
of
an
accident
which
occurred
in
virginia
waters.
and,
he
was
survived
only
by
a
niece
and
a
nephew
who
were
not
dependent
upon
the
seaman.
the
plaintiffs'
attorney
stated
that
he
had
the
right
to
recover
for
general
damages
under
the
virginia
wrongful
death
action
as
a
supplementary
law
to
the
jones
act,
which
is
exactly
what
is
being
argued
here.
in
the
lynn
grennan
decision,
the
united
states
supreme
court
held
that
the
jones
act
that'd
been
legislated
in
order
to
provide
this
field
of
law
previously
covered
by
state
ter
--
by
state
law
and,
therefore,
that
the
jones
act
superseded
the
wrongful
death
action
even
to
the
extent
of
ruling
out
general
damages.
34
years
later,
this
court
in
the
glasby
again
affirmed
the
lynn
grennan
decision,
but
separate
and
apart
from
the
general
field
of
federal
preemption
is
a
question
that
there
are
three
decisions
by
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
which
are
the
loffland
brothers
versus
roberts,
ocean
drilling
and
exploration
company
versus
berry
brothers,
and
pure
oil
company
versus
snipes
cited
on
page
9
of
our
brief.
in
which,
the
first
circuit
has
held,
and
this
court
has
approved
since
writs
of
certiorari
were
denied
in
each
one
of
these
cases,
has
held
that
on
the
outer
continental
shelf
under
section
(a)
(1)
of
title
1333
--
of
section
1333,
it
is
a
federal
maritime
law
that
is
to
apply
to
personal
injury
litigation
and
that
the
state
law
has
no
application
whatsoever.
so
that,
in
personal
injury
litigation,
insofar
as
the
stationary
platforms,
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act,
as
adopting
federal
maritime
law,
governs.
therefore,
the
state
law
apply?
the
state
law
does
not
apply
because
it
has
been
superseded
by
the
federal
death
on
the
high
seas
act.
even
if
this
court
were
to
hold
that
state
law
is
to
apply,
the
second
requirement
written
into
the
submer
--
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act
is
that
the
state
law,
before
it
can
be
adopted,
has
to
be
consistent
with
federal
laws
then
existing.
now,
i
have
set
forth
in
this
visual
aid,
as
i
did
in
my
memorandum,
as
to
a
comparison
of
the
various
elements
of
the
causes
of
action
provided
under
the
louisiana
law
and
under
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act,
the
beneficiaries
are
different,
the
damages
are
different.
now,
the
plaintiffs'
attorney
says
that
there
is
a
hiatus
in
this
particular
field
of
law
because
no
general
damages
are
provided
by
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act.
i
submit
to
you
that
the
legislature
in
1920,
the
legislature
that
enacted
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act,
specifically
contemplated
the
granting
of
general
damages.
judge
putnam
--
chief
justice
putnam
of
new
york,
who
was
the
author
of
the
bill,
provided
in
his
original
letter
to
the
congress
that
the
damages
were
for
fair
and
just
compensation.
in
1914,
the
legislative
judicial
committee
modified
--
qualified
that
language
by
saying
that
it
was
restricted
to
pecuniary
loss
and
this
concept
of
restricting
damages
to
pecuniary
loss
is
not
only
applicable
in
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act,
but
in
the
companion
case
of
the
jones
act
which
was
enacted
by
the
same
legislature
in
1920.
i
therefore
submit
to
you
that
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
is
--
does
not
provide
an
incomplete
remedy
for
damages.
it
compli
--
it
provides
for
the
complete
remedy
as
intended
by
the
legislature,
so
that
there
is
no
hiatus.
therefore,
the
two-principle
requirements
of
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act
for
the
adoption
of
state
law,
first,
its
application
of
state
law
and,
secondly,
the
fact
that
the
state
law
cannot
be
inconsistent,
it
had
not
been
complied
with
in
this
case
and,
therefore,
the
state
law
has
no
application
whatsoever.
mr.
james
e.
diaz
yes,
your
honor.
i'm
coming
to
that
that
is
the
second
avenue
that
the
plaintiffs'
attorney
has
sought
to
use
the
wrongful
death
act
of
louisiana.
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
legislative
history
shows
that
they
intended,
at
least
judge
putnam
did,
intended
for
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
to
be
the
exclusive
remedy.
now,
then,
mann
--
mr.
mann
of
illinois,
in
1920,
made
an
amendment
because
he
was
concerned
with
this.
he
says
“what
about
an
illinois
constituent
in
illinois,
does
he
have
to
go
to
new
york
to
a
federal
district
--
foreign
federal
district
court
to
assert
her
remedies?”
he
says
“i
want
to
preserve
to
the
state
courts
their
jurisdiction
under
their
own
laws
for
my
own
constituents
to
proceed
under
a
state
law.”
i
think
that
the
legislative
history
and
the
arguments
that
were
presented
by
the
legislature
in
pages
20
through
23
of
our
brief,
your
honor,
show
that
their
intention
was
not
to
give
concurrent
jurisdiction,
not
to
give
concurrent
remedies,
but
to
give
alternative
remedies.
they
wanted
to
preserve
to
suitors
the
right
to
proceed
in
state
court
under
a
state
court
remedy.
mr.
james
e.
diaz
the
death
on
the
high
seas
was
in
1920,
your
honor,
and
the
submerged
lands
act
was
in
19
--
mr.
james
e.
diaz
that's
correct.
mr.
james
e.
diaz
that
is
correct.
mr.
james
e.
diaz
only
state
law
as
adopted
by
the
federal
law.
mr.
james
e.
diaz
that
is
correct.
mr.
james
e.
diaz
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
and
that's
why
i
say
that
you
need
not
decide
whether
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
is
the
exclusive
remedy
because
this
specific
legislation
on
point
is
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act,
so
that
even
if
the
state
law
could
be
supplemented,
which
we
do
not
but
even
assuming
it
could
be
supplemented
under
death
on
the
high
seas
act,
this
specific
act
in
question,
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act
would
not
permit
it
because
the
state
law
would
be
inconsistent
with
the
applicable
federal
law.
mr.
james
e.
diaz
no
idea,
your
honor,
is
that
the
survivors
of
a
dissident
have
a
right
to
proceed
in
a
federal
forum
under
federal
law
--
mr.
james
e.
diaz
completely,
and
that
--
mr.
james
e.
diaz
and
that
--
mr.
james
e.
diaz
no
state
law
at
all,
your
honor.
that
is
correct.
now,
i
believe
that
is
the
case
on
the
outer
continental
shelf
--
under
--
mr.
james
e.
diaz
the
direct
action
statute
--
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
that
the
direct
action
statute,
first
of
all,
is
at
issue
here
but,
to
answer
your
question
--
mr.
james
e.
diaz
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
of
course,
i
believe
that
the
direct
action
statute
is
inimical
to
maritime
law.
it's
inimical
to
the
limitation
of
liability
concept
and
should
not
be
applied
in
maritime
cases
at
all,
and
these
cases
--
in
this
act,
as
occurring
on
s
--
mr.
james
e.
diaz
your
honor?
mr.
james
e.
diaz
your
honor,
it
has
been
--
excuse
me,
sir.
mr.
james
e.
diaz
it
has
been
applied,
your
honor,
but
what
i
am
saying
here
is
that
it
should
not
be
applied.
mr.
james
e.
diaz
yes,
your
honor.
yes.
mr.
james
e.
diaz
your
honor,
i
--
the
only
way
i
can
answer
that
is
this.
i
was
trained
as
a
lawyer
in
law
school
and
in
practice
to
confine
myself
with
then
the
legisla
--
within
the
legislative
provisions,
and
i
am
saying
--
is
that
the
legislative
provision
here
are
clear
that
the
only
remedy
for
deaths
occurring
on
the
--
under
the
a
--
under
the
intendment
of
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act,
the
only
remedy
is
under
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
exclusive
of
state
law.
mr.
james
e.
diaz
i
have
to
d
--
mr.
james
e.
diaz
yes,
sir,
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act.
mr.
james
e.
diaz
yes,
sir.
well,
you've
got
to
go
to
the
parent
which
is
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act
and
the
parent
adopts
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
you
can
then
--
you
cannot
then
incorporate
under
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act,
the
state
law,
which
you
cannot
do
under
the
adopted
provisions
of
the
outer
continental
shelf.
you
cannot
do
indirectly
what
you
cannot
do
directly
because
if
the
parent
act
is
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act,
then
you
have
to
look
at
that
primarily.
if
you
cannot
incorporate
state
law
under
that
act,
you
certainly
cannot
incorporate
it
under
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
which
itself
is
incorporated
in
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act.
mr.
james
e.
diaz
your
honor,
i
believe
that
the
intention
of
mr.
mann
and
mr.
sanders,
who
were
part
of
the
legis
--
part
of
the
legislature
in
1920,
was
to
allow
suitors
their
ability
to
sue
in
a
state
forum
with
state
laws
wherever
state
laws
have
been
held
to
be
competent,
as
in
the
hamilton.
i
think
a
very
strong
argument
against
--
mr.
james
e.
diaz
as
i
see
the
consequences,
your
honor,
the
survivors
of
a
dissident
would
have
an
alternate
or
elective
course
that
could
either
go
into
federal
forum
with
federal
laws,
substantive
laws,
or
they
could
go
into
a
state
forum
with
state
laws
at
their
election.
mr.
james
e.
diaz
your
honor,
i
am
of
the
opinion
that
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
should
be
given
as
exclusive
remedy,
but
if
we
are
to
give
any
effect
to
section
7
on
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act,
that's
applied,
as
mr.
mann
intended
it,
to
preserve
to
his
constituent
his
reme
--
his
right
to
go
into
a
state
court
with
a
state
court
remedy.
mr.
james
e.
diaz
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
james
e.
diaz
where
there
is
dispositive
federal
law
carrying
the
subject
matter.
mr.
james
e.
diaz
i
see
what
you
mean.
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
e.
diaz
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
e.
diaz
i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
i
didn't
mean
--
mr.
james
e.
diaz
he
--
i
had
understood
his
question
as
to
the
interpretation
of
section
7
of
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
outside
of
the
contents
of
the
outer
continental
shelf.
mr.
james
e.
diaz
that's
what
i
was
arguing
there.
those
are
my
--
my
position
is
that
the
application
of
state
law
in
this,
insofar
as
injuries
occurring
on
the
stationery
platform,
that
the
application
of
state
law
is
inimical
to
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act
and,
therefore,
cannot
be
applied.
mr.
james
e.
diaz
that's
correct.
mr.
james
e.
diaz
that's
right.
mr.
james
e.
diaz
that
is
correct.
mr.
james
e.
diaz
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
e.
diaz
justice
fortas,
i
agree
with
you
in
part,
but
i
think
that
section
(a)
(2)
has
two
conditions
precedent.
one
is
that
there
is
no
federal
dispositive
law
on
the
subject
matter
and,
secondly,
that
if
there
is
no
federal
dispositive
law,
then
state
law
may
be
used
provided
it
is
not
inconsistent
with
other
federal
laws.
mr.
james
e.
diaz
that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
i
am
saying
that
i
--
that
the
fifth
circuit
also
held
that
on
the
basis
of
the
berry
brothers
and
the
pure
oil
versus
snipes
that
here
were
two
conditions
precedent
that
had
to
be
met.
as
an
alternative
argument,
your
honors,
as
i
said
in
my
--
my
principle
position
is
that
the
state
law
cannot
be
applied
whatsoever
under
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act.
but,
as
an
alternate
argument,
if
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
does
allow
a
supplemental
remedy,
i
submit
to
you
that
the
case
cited
by
opposing
counsel,
the
higa
versus
transocean
which
he
says
is
in
his
favor,
supports
our
proposition
here
because,
in
higa,
the
court
held,
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
held,
as
affirmed
by
this
court
in
writ
of
certiorari,
that
the
state
law
may
be
applied
only
where
its
own
wrongful
death
act
provisions
give
it
extraterritorial
effect.
if
that
is
the
case,
and
that's
the
case
we're
going
to
follow
here,
i
submit
to
your
honors
that
there
has
been
no
showing
nor
can
there
be
any
that
the
louisiana
wrongful
death
act
does
not
have
any
extraterritorial
effect.
a
counsel,
opposing
counsel
has
cited
the
e.b.
ward,
jr.
and
let
me
say
this
to
you
in
connection
with
that.
the
e.b.
ward,
jr.
does
not
hold
that
louisiana
wrongful
death
act
has
extraterritorial
effect.
the
e.b.
ward,
jr.
held,
at
a
time
when
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
was
not
in
effect,
that
because
of
the
fact
that
the
shelf,
the
e.b.
ward,
was
a
louisiana
shelf,
it
was
louisiana
territory
so
that
it
could
be
governed
by
the
laws
of
the
state
of
louisiana.
in
conclusion,
your
honors,
i
respectfully
request
that
the
decision
of
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
be
affirmed
because
the
controlling
statute
is
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act,
that
there
are
patent
inconsistencies
in
the
state
law
and
in
the
federal
law
as
to
beneficiaries,
statute
of
limitations,
contribution
among
joint
tort
fees
and,
as
was
held
by
this
ca
--
by
this
court
in
the
tungus,
you
have
to
take
the
state
law
in
its
entirety
and
not
just
those
parts
of
it
which
benefit
you.
so,
if
we're
going
to
take
this
cause
of
action
provided
under
article
2315,
each
and
every
one
of
those
elements
is
inconsistent
and
contradictory
to
the
elements
of
the
cause
of
action
provided
under
the
death
on
the
highs
seas
act.
