justice
potter
stewart
well,
this
talk
about
the
submerged
lands
act.
let's
not
involved
in
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
it
came
earlier.
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
the
outer
continental
shelf
act
came
earlier.
justice
potter
stewart
the
submerged
lands
act
is
something
else,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
there
are
two
quite
different
statutes,
aren't
they
not?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
what
i
thought.
justice
potter
stewart
and
this
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
you're
not
responsible
for
this.
don't
waste
your
time
away.
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
any
question
--
is
there
any
issue
between
the
parties
here,
in
fact,
that
the
--
as
to
whether
or
not
this
artificial
island
was
within
the
contours
of
the
outer
continental
shelf?
justice
potter
stewart
geographically?
justice
potter
stewart
no
dispute
about
that?
justice
potter
stewart
but
that
would
be
in
a
delaware
court,
absent
diversity
of
citizenship,
would
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
that
would
not
be
as
a
matter
of
federal
law.
justice
potter
stewart
it'll
just
be
a
matter
of
additional
delaware
law.
justice
potter
stewart
not
exclusive,
but
the
legislative
history
also
shows
that
the
intent
was
to
make
a
uniform
remedy.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
when
was
that
enacted?
do
you
happen
to
know?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
and
the
statute
which
we
know
of
as
the
submerged
lands
act
was
enacted
in
1953.
however,
you're
talking
about
the
