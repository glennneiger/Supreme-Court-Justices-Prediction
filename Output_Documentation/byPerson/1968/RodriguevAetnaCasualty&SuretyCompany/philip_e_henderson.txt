mr.

may
i
please
--
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i'm
philip
henderson
from
homer,
louisiana.
in
this
case,
there
is
presented
the
issue
of
whether
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
is
the
exclusive
remedy
for
wrongful
death
occurring
to
one
of
the
workers
on
the
artificial
islands,
fixed
platforms,
in
the
outer
continental
shelf,
off
of
the
coast
of
louisiana
in
this
case.
actually,
before
the
court
today
are
two
cases
that
came
here
on
a
joint
petition
for
a
writ
of
certiorari.
the
two
cases
present
exactly
the
same
issue
in
the
owlet
budrow
rodrigue
case.
she
is
suing--
she
and
her
children
are
suing
on--
for
the
death
of
her
husband.
budrow
rodrigue
fell
from
the
top
of
a
derrick
to
his
death
on
the
drilling
platform
floor.
it
is
alleged
that
the
death
was
caused
by
the
negligence
of
the
operator
of
the
platform
and
the
drilling
company.
in
the
dore
case--
or
let
met
continue
and
bring
the
rodrigue
case
up
to
the
court.
before
the
death,
mrs.
rodrigue
brought
actually
three
suits.
she
brought
one
suit
under
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act.
this
suit
was
brought
in
admiralty.
she
brought
two
civil
action
claiming
that
the
louisiana
death
act,
which
was
the
adjacent
state
in
this
case,
and
the
rodrigue
death
occurred
on
a
platform
which
was
28
miles
seaward
of
the
coast
of
louisiana.
in
these
civil
actions,
mrs.
rodrigue
contended
that
the
louisiana
death
act
was
extended
to
these
artificial
islands
by
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act
which
specifically
provides
that
the
law
of
the
adjacent
state
shall
be
extended
to
the
artificial
islands
in
the
outer
continental
shelf
and
shall
be
applied
when
not
inconsistent
with
a
federal
law.
the
cases
were
consolidated.
motions
were
filed
by
the
defendants
to
dismiss
all
of
the
claims
actually
contending
that
one
of
the
other
was
an
exclusive
remedy.
the
trial
judge
denied
all
motions.
the
case
was
fixed
for
trial
with
the
jury
to
hear
the
civil
actions,
the
judge
to
hear
the
admiralty
action
concurrently.
on
the
morning
of
the
trial
after
a
jury
was
empanelled,
the
judge
changed
his
mind
and
granted
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
civil
actions.
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
not
many,
your
honor,
just
one.
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
i
was
given
copies
this
morning.
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
well,
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act
actually
is
part
of
the
submerged
lands
act.
people
somehow
--
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir?
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
well
--
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
if
your
honor
please,
i
always
refer
to
that
act
as
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act.
i
have
heard
it
referred
to
by
the
persons
as
the
submerged
lands
act
--
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
if
your
honor
please,
i
don't
know.
i
am
dealing
here
with
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act.
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
and
that's
not
my
--
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
my
document
--
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
now,
when
the
trial
judge
dismissed
the
two
civil
actions,
he
held
that
the
exclusive
remedy
for
death
on
the
artificial
island
was
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act
--
excuse
me,
was
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act.
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
none
whatsoever.
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
none
whatsoever.
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
no
dispute
about
that
as
to
either
the
budrow
rodrigue
case
or
the
dubois
dore
case.
both
platforms
were
within
the
continental
shelf
and
both
were
adjacent
to
the
state
of
louisiana.
an
appeal
was
taken
for
the
dismissal
of
the
civil
actions
to
the
fifth
circuit.
in
the
dubois
dore
case,
mr.
dore
was
a
crane
operator
on
one
of
these
artificial
islands
or
platforms.
the
crane
collapsed.
mr.
dore
fell
to
his
death.
for
his
death,
his
widow
and
children
brought
suit,
a
single
action
claiming,
as
one
cause
of
action,
a
right
under
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
and
also
claimed
rights
under
the
louisiana
death
act.
the
louisiana
death
act
allows
recompense
for
not
only
the
pecuniary
lawsuits
but
also
allows
a
recompense
for
lost
of
love,
affection,
and
companionship.
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
only
allows
a
recompense
for
pecuniary
lawsuits.
in
the
dubois
dore
case,
the
defendants,
at
the
district
court
level,
filed
a
motion
to
strike
the
louisiana
cause
of
action
and
to
strike
all
claims
or
none
pecuniary
damages.
the
district
judge
granted
this
motion
and
then
certified
the
question
that's
raised
in
a
motion
to
the
fifth
circuit
so
that,
actually,
the
dore
case
reached
the
fifth
circuit
before
the
rodrigue
case,
though
both
involved
exactly
the
same
issue.
in
the
fifth
circuit,
the
court
held
that
the
exclusive
remedy
for
a
death
was
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act.
if
this
court
had
granted
the
certiorari,
the
rodrigue
case
actually
followed
the
dore
case
very
promptly.
the
court
in
the
rodrigue
case
issued
a
per
curiam
opinion
and
simply
referred
to
our
decision
in
the
dore
case.
it
is
our
contention
that
the
fifth
circuit
erred
in
holding
that
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
is
the
exclusive
remedy.
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act
specifically
extends
the
law
of
the
adjacent
state
to
the
particular
islands
and
it
is
to
be
applied
where
not
in
consistent
with
the
federal
law.
now,
the
holding
that
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
was
an
exclusive
remedy
is
clearly
an
error
because
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
specifically
provides
that
it
is
not
an
exclusive
remedy.
section
7
of
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
reads
the
provisions
of
any
state
statute
giving
or
regulating
rights
of
action
or
remedies
for
death
shall
not
be
affected
by
this
chapter.
now,
it's
hard
to
see
how
anything
could
be
clearer
than
that.
now,
at
the
time
of
the
adoption
of
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act,
there
were
some
state
statutes
which
were
construed
as
giving
rights
of
action
for
death
on
the
high
seas.
the
most
famous
of
these
cases
is
the
hamilton.
also,
there
we
--
there
happen
to
be
a
case,
the
e.b.
ward,
jr.
which
was
a
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
case
applying
the
very
same
louisiana
death
act
that's
at
issue
here
to
a
death
which
occurred
in
a
collision
between
two
vessels
in
the
gulf
of
mexico.
both
of
these
cases
were
on
the
books
at
the
time
of
the
adoption
of
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act.
the
clarity
of
this
specific
statement
in
the
death
on
a
high
seas
act
that
it
shall
not
affect
the
rights
given
by
state
statutes
is
highlighted
by
the
legislative
history.
at
the
time
that
this
bill,
it
was
a
senate
bill
when
it
was
in
the
house
just
before
the
passage,
at
that
time,
there
was
a
debate
as
to
whether
the
act
should
be
an
exclusive
remedy.
at
that
point,
section
7,
which
i
have
just
read
to
you,
provided
that
the
provisions
of
any
state
statute
giving
or
regulating
rights
of
action
are
remedies
for
death
shall
not
be
affected
by
this
act
as
to
causes
of
action
accruing
within
the
territorial
limits
of
any
state.
now,
that
made
it
clear
that
there
was
a
limitation
upon
this
--
what
the
act
was
going
to
affect.
however,
those
last
words
as
to
causes
of
action
accruing
within
the
limits
of
any
state
were
deleted
after
argument
and
after
debate.
they
were
deleted
so
that
the
act
would
read
that
the
provisions
of
any
state
statute
given
--
giving
or
regulating
rights
of
action
are
remedies
for
death
shall
not
be
affected
by
this
act
without
any
limiting
feature.
now,
it
is
true
that
during
that
debate
some
of
the
people
who
debated
said
that
this
act
should
be
exclusive,
some
said
that
it
shouldn't.
actually,
the
final
blow
on
the
amendment
was
201
in
favor
of
the
amendment
to
75
against
it.
counsel
for
respondents
seems
to
take
comfort
from
the
fact
that
some
of
the
persons
who
debated
gave
some
reasons
why
they
thought
that
the
amendment
shouldn't
be
passed
or
that
if
it
passed,
it
didn't
make
any
difference.
but,
the
fact
is
that
there
were
201
as
opposed
to
75
of
the
legislators
who
voted
for
this
amendment
so
that
the
act
would
plainly
read
that
the
provisions
of
any
state
statute
giving
or
regulating
rights
of
action
or
remedies
for
death
shall
not
be
affected
by
this
act.
it
couldn't
be
plainer.
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
on
one
of
the
islands
or
one
of
the
artificial
--
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
well,now
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act,
of
course,
gives
its
own
cause
of
action.
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
the
loui
--
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act
would
not
give
a
cause
of
action
because
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act
applies
only
to
these
islands.
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
as
to
the
old
cases
that
were
in
existence
--
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
i
don't
think
in
that
circumstances,
your
honor,
that
the
direct
line
in
the
state
of
louisiana
really
has
any
bearing.
i
would
think
that
the
only
time
in
which
the
direct
line
from
the
state
of
louisiana
has
any
bearing
is
under
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act
because
it's
--
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
i
call
it
supplementary,
your
honor.
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
or
cumulative
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
not
necessarily.
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
no,
i
think
--
i
think,
your
honor,
that
--
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
in
the
instant
cases,
your
honor,
that
point
was
clearly
met
because
the
outer
continental
shelf
act
does
specifically
say
that
as
to
these
platforms
involved,
because
they
are
adjacent
to
the
state,
that
the
louisiana
law
does
apply
there.
now
--
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
as
loui
--
as
adopted
federal
law,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
correct,
sir.
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
that's
correct.
jurisdiction
is
not
really
--
it's
federal
jurisdiction.
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
yes,
sir.
it's
adopted
federal
law.
it's
federal
jurisdiction.
it's
adopted
to
be
applied
where
not
inconsistent
with
federal
law
but,
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
think,
to
get
back
to
your
original
question,
your
question
could
be
phrased
to
be
whether
it
be
state
death
acts
in
a
situation
in
which
the
outer
continental
shelf
is
not
involved
might
still
be
applied
according
to
my
argument.
is
that
--
that
is
the
question.
now,
i
point
out
first
that
that
is
not
particularly
at
issue
here,
but
my
question
--
but
the
answer
is,
i
think,
yes.
i
think
that
that
is
the
clear
intent
of
the
legislators.
they
discussed
that
in
the
legislative
history
that
the
discussion
--
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
no,
sir
--
yes,
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act.
they
discussed
the
case
of
the
hamilton
and
they
noted
that,
because
there
was
a
delaware
ship
involved
and
the
defendant
was
a
delaware
corporation
and
i
believe
that
the
plaintiffs
were
citizens
of
delaware,
that
with
those
facts,
that
the
delaware
law
could
apply.
the
law
of
delaware
would
have
to
be
looked
to.
the
conflicts
of
laws
rules
of
the
state
of
delaware
would
have
to
be
looked
to,
and
if
they
gave
a
remedy
under
those
circumstances,
the
remedy
would
be
available.
now,
it
was
also
pointed
out
in
that
debate
that
the
state
of
massachusetts
had
different
conflicts
of
law
or
rules
and
they
discussed
one
of
the
men
from
massachusetts
got
up
and
said
“well,
in
such-and-such
a
case
there
was
a
collision
but
the
ship
was
owned
by
a
massachusetts
corporation,
but
the
other
ship
was
not.
it
was
owned
by
a
different
state
and
that
the
rules
were
hopelessly
in
conflict,
and
they
gave
no
remedy.”
and
so,
to
answer
your
question,
i
would
think
that
if
a
delaware
ship
and
if
the
delaware
law
has
not
changed,
if
a
delaware
ship
with
a
delaware
corporation
with
a
delaware
plaintiff
were
involve,
yes,
delaware
could
give
its
citizens
a
cause
of
action
under
its
laws
for
a
death
on
the
high
seas
in
addition
to
our
supplementary
to
what
would
be
available
to
that
person
under
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act.
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
i
would
think
so.
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
that's
correct.
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
that's
right.
i
think
that
that
is
certainly
what
these
legislators
were
discussing
when
they
amended
this
provision,
so
that
the
provision
would
read
that
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
shall
not
affect
state
remedies.
that's
precisely
what
they
had
in
mind
and
they
went
through
that
discussion
just
exactly
as
i
related
it
to
you.
now,
in
the
instant
cases,
we
really
don't
have
to
see
whether
louisiana,
in
this
day
and
time,
would
apply
its
conflict
of
laws
rule
so
as
to,
in
a
given
situation,
allow
a
cause
of
action
out
there
because
the
louisiana
law
as
adopted
federal
law
is
specifically
extended
to
these
islands.
at
--
but
the
crucial
and
important
port
is
that
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
does
say
in
plain
terms
that
it
is
not
an
exclusive
remedy.
that
is
different
than
the
jones
act
which
doesn't
say.
the
jones
act,
as
you
will
regard
--
i'm
certain
the
lynn
grennan,
glasby
decisions,
the
statement
of
this
court
was
that
congress
in
enacting
the
jones
act
intended
to
make
a
uniform
remedy.
however,
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
is
different
than
the
jones
act,
in
that,
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
specifically
provides
that
the
remedy
is
not
exclusive.
now,
actually
--
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
a
uniform
basic
remedy.
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
actually,
they
used
the
word
“basic.”
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
in
this
discussion.
that
is
true.
the
man
from
massachusetts
says
“i
want
to
be
sure
i
get
something.
so,
alright,
you
got
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act,”
but
the
man
from
delaware
says
“i
don't
want
you
taking
away
what
might
be
available
in
addition
under
my
law”
and,
of
course,
there
is
nothing
unusual
whatsoever
in
allowing
curative
remedies
for
the
same
wrong.
suppose
that
a
man
has
a
chattel
or
suppose
that
a
man
is
using
someone
else's
chattel
and
damages
it,
while
the
man
who
has
suffered
the
damage,
if
he
can
come
within
the
terms
of
a
contract,
he
can
collect
under
contract.
if
not,
he
can
collect
under
tort.
but,
does
the
fact
that
he
may
have
a
remedy
under
contract
preclude
him
from
having
a
remedy
under
tort?
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
not
in
these
cases,
we
d
--
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
the
longshoremen's
act
--
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
yes,
it
does.
the
longshoremen's
act
is
strictly
an
employer-employee
act
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
the
workman's
compensation
act
in
the
--
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
negligent
parties
in
this
--
in
both
of
these
cases
are
not
the
employer.
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
then,
the
--
every
law
available
to
them,
except
of
course
the
jones
act
--
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
no,
sir,
they
don't
--
the
continental
shelf
lands
act
really
doest
say
anything
about
--
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
yes.
well,
the
state
law
--
actually,
the
state
law
is
extended.
that
is
correct,
we're
not
--
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
this
--
the
state
law
--
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
the
state
law
will
apply,
yes,
that
is
correct.
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
no,
it
doesn't
really
say
that.
it
says
where
there's
conflict.
now,
that's
the
bone,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
conflicting,
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
yes,
sir.
that's
it,
precisely.
i
am
saying
that
there
is
nothing
conflict
--
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
i
didn't
hear
you,
your
honor,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
no,
i'm
saying
that
“conflicting”
does
not
mean
“not
identical.”
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
yes,
it
does.
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
no,
comparative
negligence
is
a
rule.
your
honor,
i
--
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
no,
sir.
i
am
say
--
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
i
am
saying
--
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
what
i'm
saying,
your
honor,
is
that
perhaps,
and
this
is
the
meat
of
the
manner
right
here,
the
word
“conflict”
does
not
mean
un
--
“different”
exactly.
in
other
words,
your
honor,
if
“conflict”
meant
“different,”
in
other
words,
if
the
only
louisiana
law
that
could
apply
on
there
was
law
that
was
exactly
and
precisely
the
same
as
the
same
as
the
federal
law
that
was
already
in
existence
out
there,
what
were
the
legislators
doing
in
saying
that
the
louisiana
law
has
to
be
applied
out
there?
they
were
doing
a
vane
and
useless
thing.
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
i've
lost
my
cause
of
action
under
louisiana
law,
that's
right.
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
if
i
can
come
within
the
terms
of
louisiana
law,
i
can
get
the
benefits
of
the
louisiana
law.
if
i
can
prove,
in
this
case
and
in
any
death
case,
i
am
contributory
negligent,
i
cannot
bring
myself
within
the
terms
of
the
louisiana
law
and,
thus,
that
cause
of
action
is
out.
and,
of
course,
with
it
goes
my
claim
for
loss
of
love
and
affection.
now,
if
i
can't
come
within
the
terms
of
louisiana
law,
i
don't
get
it.
just
as
though
there
were
a
man
with
a
chattel
who
were
using
it
and
it
was
damaged.
if
the
plaintiff
can
come
within
the
terms
of
a
contract,
he
can
have
the
benefits
of
the
contract
even
though
the
remedies
might
be
different,
the
statute
of
limitations
might
be
different,
he
st
--
he
can
--
if
he
can
bring
himself
within
that
contract,
he
can
obtain
the
rights
of
the
contract.
if
he
can't
bring
himself
within
it,
he
cannot.
he
still
has
tort
remedies.
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
of
course
i'm
claiming
no
double
recovery.
i'm
saying
that
i
could
have
a
right
under
either
statutes,
just
like
an
injured
seaman
has
a
right
under
unseaworthiness
in
the
jones
act.
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
yes.
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
it
could
be,
yes.
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
yes,
one
--
the
one
in
the
high
seas
act
would
definitely
have
to
be
by
the
judge
in
admiralty,
yes.
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
if
requested.
in
other
words,
if
i
could
bring
myself
within
the
terms
of
that
law
--
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
yes,
it
would.
yes,
in
other
words,
if
i
can
bring
myself
within
the
terms
of
the
other,
i
can
come
in
--
i
can
come
and
have
its
benefits.
to
answer
justice
white's
argument,
i
take
the
position
--
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
yes,
your
honor?
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
no,
sir.
the
dore
case
is
one
of
the
cases
at
issue
here.
there
are
two
cases
which
have
come
before
this
court
now
in
a
joint
petition.
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
yes,
the
higa
case,
i
say,
is
in
my
favor,
yes.
that's
true.
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
no,
i
think
that
the
whole
matter
could
be
tried
jointly.
if
the
party
wants
a
jury
trial
under
his
state,
under
the
louisiana
federally
adopted
law,
it
could
all
be
tried
with
the
judge
sitting
in
admiralty.
and,
if
the
jury
finds
contributory
negligence,
why,
of
course,
there
is
no
cause
of
action
under
the
louisiana
law.
there
would,
of
course,
be
special
interrogatories
to
the
jury.
is
there
--
was
the
plaintiff
negligent?
if
they
answer
yes
to
that,
why,
then
the
jury
case
is
out.
if
they
say
yes,
why,
then
the
--
they
would
go
on
to
answer
quantum
and
everything
as
is
ordinary
in
a
jury
trial,
but
there
would
be
interrogatories
to
the
jury.
it
would
pose
no
procedural
problem.
there
are
cases
in
which
that's
done.
i've
cited
some
in
my
brief
in
which
a
case
was
tried
under
both
the
death
on
high
seas
act
and
under
japanese
law,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
as
one
side
of
my
district
court
case.
i
say,
in
response
to
justice
white's
question,
that
the
jones
act
is
conflict
with
or
inconsistent
with
unseaworthiness
or
damages
under
the
jones
act
or
unseaworthiness
are
not
in
conflict
with
or
inconsistent
with
maintenance
in
cure.
they're
just
overlapping
in
supplementary
remedies,
mr.
justice.
if
my
analogy
in
a
man
that
might
have
a
remedy
for
both
contract
and
tort,
they're
not
even
consistent.
it's
just
the
rule
rather
than
the
exception
to
have
possibility
of
two
or
three
remedies
--
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
if
you
can
bring
yourself
within
the
terms.
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
yes.
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
no,
i
say
that
it
is
to
the
issue
at
--
at
issue
here
as
to
the
narrow
issue
you
would
hear
there
and
here,
in
this
case,
there
is
not
even
a
second
remedy.
there
is
not
federal
remedy
for
no
“yey”
or
“ney”
as
to
loss
of
love
and
affection.
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
only
treats
pecuniary
losses.
it
does
not
even
treat
loss
of
love
and
affection
--
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
and
say
“yey”
or
“ney.”
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
yes.
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
yes,
if
you
would
say
that
the
two
laws
are
in
conflict,
yes,
your
honor,
i
would
--
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
no,
i
would
say
that,
then,
the
case
which
i've
mentioned
to
justice
fortas,
is
that
if
he
louisiana
laws
under
these
conflict
rules
allow
recover
here
then,
yes,
there
could
be
recovery
here.
they're
just
--
we
couldn't
use
the
outer
continental
shelf
vehicle.
i
see
that
i'm
running
out
of
time
and
i
do
want
to
save
some
time
for
rebuttal,
your
honor.
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
but,
i
did
want
to
save
some
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
thank
you.
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
may
it
please
the
court.
i'll
take
the
discussion
of
the
higa
case
first.
in
the
higa
case,
mr.
higa
died
on
an
airplane
enroot
from
california
to
hawaii.
he
died
when
the
plane
crash
in
the
middle
of
the
ocean.
his
dependants,
survivors,
filed
suit
under
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
and
also
claimed
a
civil
action
as
we
are
here.
the
court
--
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
the
higa
case
first
said
“we
are
looking
to
see
whether
the
conflicts
of
laws
rules
of
hawaii
apply,”
and
this
is
--
they
took
special
note
that
the
airplane
was
owned
by
a
california
company
and
said
“no.”
they
then
said
there
is
no
statute
that
would
apply
the
hawaii
death
act
to
this
area
and
there
is
no
decisional
law
that
would
apply
under
conflicts
of
laws
rules,
the
hawaii
death
act,
to
this
death.
now,
in
our
case,
we
have
both.
we've
got
a
statute.
we've
got
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act
and
we
also
have
our
death
on
the
high
seas
act.
snipes
and
loffland
brothers,
which
are
cited
as
this
circuit's
holdings,
did
not
hold
that
federal
law
is
the
exclusive
remedy.
they
only
held
that
state
law
was
not
exclusive
remedy.
in
both
of
those
cases,
the
defendant
says
the
man's
action
must
be
dismissed
under
state
law
because
he
was
contributory
and
negligent
in
one
case
and
because
the
state's
statute
of
limitations
had
run
in
the
other,
but
the
court
said
“no,
that's
not
true,
that
the
state
remedy
is
not
his
exclusive
remedy
and
that
he
does
have
a
federal
remedy.”
those
cases
didn't
say
the
federal
remedy
is
exclusive.
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
if
your
honor
please
--
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
i
think
that
that
--
that
the
word
“conflict”
is
--
the
approach
is
wrong
in
trying
to
see
where
they're
not
identical.
i
don't
think
that
the
word
“inconsistent”
meant
“not
identical.”
otherwise,
nothing
could've
been
extended
by
that
act.
i
think
“conflict”
means
“opposed
to
one
another.”
for
instance,
if
the
federal
rule
was
that
the
minerals
extracted
from
these
artificial
islands
are
the
property
of
the
federal
government
and
if
the
state
law
said
that
the
minerals
extracted
are
the
property
of
private
citizens,
they're
in
conflict
and
so,
obviously,
the
state
statute
would
have
to
give
way,
but,
as
to
a
tort
action
or
a
death
action,
why,
these
are
cumulative
supplementary
remedies.
the
cumulative
remedy
for
the
same
incident
is
the
rule
rather
than
the
exception
in
law,
as
my
example
when
a
man
may
have
a
right
in
contract
or
quasi-contract
or
tort
for
the
same
incident.
they're
not
in
conflict
of
one
another.
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
yes.
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
i
would
say
that
there's
no
inconsistency.
i
would
say
that
the
louisiana
act
would
still
be
available
if
i
could
bring
myself
with
its
terms.
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
i
think
--
i
say
that
the
rule
of
law
is
that
it
does
not
follow
that
if
there
is
one
avenue
by
which
a
destination
can
be
reached,
that
there
can
be
no
other
avenue.
i
say
that,
for
a
man
whose
chattel
is
damaged,
if
he
has
an
avenue
to
get
recovery
under
tort
--
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
that
does
not
mean
he
can't
get
it
under
contract
--
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
and
get
something
better.
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
if
they
die
or
--
diametrically
oppose,
if
one
says
that
you
--
that,
as
a
policy
of
the
united
states,
that
--
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
that
you
can't
do
this,
then
you
can't
do
it.
the
state
law
must
give
way.
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
no,
i
don't
think
that
there
is
a
diametric
opposition.
it's
just
one
route
to
recovery.
there
can
be
another
route
to
recovery
if
you
can
bring
yourself
in
these
terms.
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
well,
they're
different.
the
two
laws
are
not
identical.
there
are
many
differences.
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
beyond
the
two
years,
i
do
--
actually,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
louisiana
act
has
a
one-year
statute,
but
is
--
if
we
assume
that
the
louisiana
has
got
a
three-year
statute,
then
if
the
person
can
bring
himself
within
the
terms
of
the
louisiana
act
as
adopted
federal
law,
he
can
have
a
recovery.
in
other
words,
if
he
brings
it
within
three
years,
he
can
do
it.
in
the
instant
case,
if
a
man
brings
his
suit
within
one
year
and
if
he
is
not
contributory
negligent,
then
he's
entitled
to
his
louisiana
recovery.
if
he
can't
come
within
the
t
--
within
the
terms
of
the
statute,
if
he's
contributory
negligent,
as
i
say,
he
cannot
have
his
recovery
under
louisiana
law.
he's
just
--
if
he
can't
bring
himself
within
the
terms
of
that
act,
just
like
in
a
contract
situation,
if
he
can't
come
within
the
terms
of
the
contract,
he's
got
no
contract
remedy.
he's
only
got
a
tort
remedy.
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
no,
sir.
i
--
the
only
real
--
the
only
question
is
the
word
“inconsistent
with.”
if
“inconsistent
with”
means
“opposed,”
why
then,
that's
one
thing.
if
it
means
“not
identical,”
why
then,
of
course,
then
that's
another
thing.
but,
i
say
that
the
word
“inconsistent
with”
can't
mean
“identical”
or
there
could
be
no
law
whatsoever
extended
out
there.
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
because,
then,
the
legislature
was
wasting
its
breath
and
ink
in
extending
that
the
law
--
in
saying
that
the
louisiana
law
shall
be
extended
out
there
because
it's
got
to
have
a
different
result
or
what's
the
good
of
extending
it
out
there?
if
it
doesn't
have
any
different
result
in
extending
the
louisiana
law
out
there,
then
why
in
the
world
extend
it
out
there?
the
legislature
had
to
mean
something
in
saying
that
that
law
is
extended.
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
yes,
but
then
it
would
--
then
you'd
have
a
different
result
by
the
louisiana
law
that's
out
there.
it
would
be
not
identical
with
the
federal
law
that's
out
there.
it
would
be
--
you'd
have
a
different
result.
i
say
the
cumulative
remedies
or
the
rule
in
law
rather
than
a
single
avenue
had
recovered
it.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
may
i
please
--
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i'm
philip
henderson
from
homer,
louisiana.
in
this
case,
there
is
presented
the
issue
of
whether
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
is
the
exclusive
remedy
for
wrongful
death
occurring
to
one
of
the
workers
on
the
artificial
islands,
fixed
platforms,
in
the
outer
continental
shelf,
off
of
the
coast
of
louisiana
in
this
case.
actually,
before
the
court
today
are
two
cases
that
came
here
on
a
joint
petition
for
a
writ
of
certiorari.
the
two
cases
present
exactly
the
same
issue
in
the
owlet
budrow
rodrigue
case.
she
is
suing--
she
and
her
children
are
suing
on--
for
the
death
of
her
husband.
budrow
rodrigue
fell
from
the
top
of
a
derrick
to
his
death
on
the
drilling
platform
floor.
it
is
alleged
that
the
death
was
caused
by
the
negligence
of
the
operator
of
the
platform
and
the
drilling
company.
in
the
dore
case--
or
let
met
continue
and
bring
the
rodrigue
case
up
to
the
court.
before
the
death,
mrs.
rodrigue
brought
actually
three
suits.
she
brought
one
suit
under
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act.
this
suit
was
brought
in
admiralty.
she
brought
two
civil
action
claiming
that
the
louisiana
death
act,
which
was
the
adjacent
state
in
this
case,
and
the
rodrigue
death
occurred
on
a
platform
which
was
28
miles
seaward
of
the
coast
of
louisiana.
in
these
civil
actions,
mrs.
rodrigue
contended
that
the
louisiana
death
act
was
extended
to
these
artificial
islands
by
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act
which
specifically
provides
that
the
law
of
the
adjacent
state
shall
be
extended
to
the
artificial
islands
in
the
outer
continental
shelf
and
shall
be
applied
when
not
inconsistent
with
a
federal
law.
the
cases
were
consolidated.
motions
were
filed
by
the
defendants
to
dismiss
all
of
the
claims
actually
contending
that
one
of
the
other
was
an
exclusive
remedy.
the
trial
judge
denied
all
motions.
the
case
was
fixed
for
trial
with
the
jury
to
hear
the
civil
actions,
the
judge
to
hear
the
admiralty
action
concurrently.
on
the
morning
of
the
trial
after
a
jury
was
empanelled,
the
judge
changed
his
mind
and
granted
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
civil
actions.
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
not
many,
your
honor,
just
one.
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
i
was
given
copies
this
morning.
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
well,
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act
actually
is
part
of
the
submerged
lands
act.
people
somehow
--
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir?
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
well
--
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
if
your
honor
please,
i
always
refer
to
that
act
as
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act.
i
have
heard
it
referred
to
by
the
persons
as
the
submerged
lands
act
--
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
if
your
honor
please,
i
don't
know.
i
am
dealing
here
with
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act.
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
and
that's
not
my
--
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
my
document
--
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
now,
when
the
trial
judge
dismissed
the
two
civil
actions,
he
held
that
the
exclusive
remedy
for
death
on
the
artificial
island
was
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act
--
excuse
me,
was
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act.
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
none
whatsoever.
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
none
whatsoever.
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
no
dispute
about
that
as
to
either
the
budrow
rodrigue
case
or
the
dubois
dore
case.
both
platforms
were
within
the
continental
shelf
and
both
were
adjacent
to
the
state
of
louisiana.
an
appeal
was
taken
for
the
dismissal
of
the
civil
actions
to
the
fifth
circuit.
in
the
dubois
dore
case,
mr.
dore
was
a
crane
operator
on
one
of
these
artificial
islands
or
platforms.
the
crane
collapsed.
mr.
dore
fell
to
his
death.
for
his
death,
his
widow
and
children
brought
suit,
a
single
action
claiming,
as
one
cause
of
action,
a
right
under
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
and
also
claimed
rights
under
the
louisiana
death
act.
the
louisiana
death
act
allows
recompense
for
not
only
the
pecuniary
lawsuits
but
also
allows
a
recompense
for
lost
of
love,
affection,
and
companionship.
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
only
allows
a
recompense
for
pecuniary
lawsuits.
in
the
dubois
dore
case,
the
defendants,
at
the
district
court
level,
filed
a
motion
to
strike
the
louisiana
cause
of
action
and
to
strike
all
claims
or
none
pecuniary
damages.
the
district
judge
granted
this
motion
and
then
certified
the
question
that's
raised
in
a
motion
to
the
fifth
circuit
so
that,
actually,
the
dore
case
reached
the
fifth
circuit
before
the
rodrigue
case,
though
both
involved
exactly
the
same
issue.
in
the
fifth
circuit,
the
court
held
that
the
exclusive
remedy
for
a
death
was
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act.
if
this
court
had
granted
the
certiorari,
the
rodrigue
case
actually
followed
the
dore
case
very
promptly.
the
court
in
the
rodrigue
case
issued
a
per
curiam
opinion
and
simply
referred
to
our
decision
in
the
dore
case.
it
is
our
contention
that
the
fifth
circuit
erred
in
holding
that
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
is
the
exclusive
remedy.
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act
specifically
extends
the
law
of
the
adjacent
state
to
the
particular
islands
and
it
is
to
be
applied
where
not
in
consistent
with
the
federal
law.
now,
the
holding
that
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
was
an
exclusive
remedy
is
clearly
an
error
because
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
specifically
provides
that
it
is
not
an
exclusive
remedy.
section
7
of
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
reads
the
provisions
of
any
state
statute
giving
or
regulating
rights
of
action
or
remedies
for
death
shall
not
be
affected
by
this
chapter.
now,
it's
hard
to
see
how
anything
could
be
clearer
than
that.
now,
at
the
time
of
the
adoption
of
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act,
there
were
some
state
statutes
which
were
construed
as
giving
rights
of
action
for
death
on
the
high
seas.
the
most
famous
of
these
cases
is
the
hamilton.
also,
there
we
--
there
happen
to
be
a
case,
the
e.b.
ward,
jr.
which
was
a
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
case
applying
the
very
same
louisiana
death
act
that's
at
issue
here
to
a
death
which
occurred
in
a
collision
between
two
vessels
in
the
gulf
of
mexico.
both
of
these
cases
were
on
the
books
at
the
time
of
the
adoption
of
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act.
the
clarity
of
this
specific
statement
in
the
death
on
a
high
seas
act
that
it
shall
not
affect
the
rights
given
by
state
statutes
is
highlighted
by
the
legislative
history.
at
the
time
that
this
bill,
it
was
a
senate
bill
when
it
was
in
the
house
just
before
the
passage,
at
that
time,
there
was
a
debate
as
to
whether
the
act
should
be
an
exclusive
remedy.
at
that
point,
section
7,
which
i
have
just
read
to
you,
provided
that
the
provisions
of
any
state
statute
giving
or
regulating
rights
of
action
are
remedies
for
death
shall
not
be
affected
by
this
act
as
to
causes
of
action
accruing
within
the
territorial
limits
of
any
state.
now,
that
made
it
clear
that
there
was
a
limitation
upon
this
--
what
the
act
was
going
to
affect.
however,
those
last
words
as
to
causes
of
action
accruing
within
the
limits
of
any
state
were
deleted
after
argument
and
after
debate.
they
were
deleted
so
that
the
act
would
read
that
the
provisions
of
any
state
statute
given
--
giving
or
regulating
rights
of
action
are
remedies
for
death
shall
not
be
affected
by
this
act
without
any
limiting
feature.
now,
it
is
true
that
during
that
debate
some
of
the
people
who
debated
said
that
this
act
should
be
exclusive,
some
said
that
it
shouldn't.
actually,
the
final
blow
on
the
amendment
was
201
in
favor
of
the
amendment
to
75
against
it.
counsel
for
respondents
seems
to
take
comfort
from
the
fact
that
some
of
the
persons
who
debated
gave
some
reasons
why
they
thought
that
the
amendment
shouldn't
be
passed
or
that
if
it
passed,
it
didn't
make
any
difference.
but,
the
fact
is
that
there
were
201
as
opposed
to
75
of
the
legislators
who
voted
for
this
amendment
so
that
the
act
would
plainly
read
that
the
provisions
of
any
state
statute
giving
or
regulating
rights
of
action
or
remedies
for
death
shall
not
be
affected
by
this
act.
it
couldn't
be
plainer.
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
on
one
of
the
islands
or
one
of
the
artificial
--
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
well,now
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act,
of
course,
gives
its
own
cause
of
action.
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
the
loui
--
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act
would
not
give
a
cause
of
action
because
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act
applies
only
to
these
islands.
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
as
to
the
old
cases
that
were
in
existence
--
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
i
don't
think
in
that
circumstances,
your
honor,
that
the
direct
line
in
the
state
of
louisiana
really
has
any
bearing.
i
would
think
that
the
only
time
in
which
the
direct
line
from
the
state
of
louisiana
has
any
bearing
is
under
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act
because
it's
--
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
i
call
it
supplementary,
your
honor.
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
or
cumulative
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
not
necessarily.
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
no,
i
think
--
i
think,
your
honor,
that
--
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
in
the
instant
cases,
your
honor,
that
point
was
clearly
met
because
the
outer
continental
shelf
act
does
specifically
say
that
as
to
these
platforms
involved,
because
they
are
adjacent
to
the
state,
that
the
louisiana
law
does
apply
there.
now
--
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
as
loui
--
as
adopted
federal
law,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
correct,
sir.
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
that's
correct.
jurisdiction
is
not
really
--
it's
federal
jurisdiction.
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
yes,
sir.
it's
adopted
federal
law.
it's
federal
jurisdiction.
it's
adopted
to
be
applied
where
not
inconsistent
with
federal
law
but,
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
think,
to
get
back
to
your
original
question,
your
question
could
be
phrased
to
be
whether
it
be
state
death
acts
in
a
situation
in
which
the
outer
continental
shelf
is
not
involved
might
still
be
applied
according
to
my
argument.
is
that
--
that
is
the
question.
now,
i
point
out
first
that
that
is
not
particularly
at
issue
here,
but
my
question
--
but
the
answer
is,
i
think,
yes.
i
think
that
that
is
the
clear
intent
of
the
legislators.
they
discussed
that
in
the
legislative
history
that
the
discussion
--
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
no,
sir
--
yes,
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act.
they
discussed
the
case
of
the
hamilton
and
they
noted
that,
because
there
was
a
delaware
ship
involved
and
the
defendant
was
a
delaware
corporation
and
i
believe
that
the
plaintiffs
were
citizens
of
delaware,
that
with
those
facts,
that
the
delaware
law
could
apply.
the
law
of
delaware
would
have
to
be
looked
to.
the
conflicts
of
laws
rules
of
the
state
of
delaware
would
have
to
be
looked
to,
and
if
they
gave
a
remedy
under
those
circumstances,
the
remedy
would
be
available.
now,
it
was
also
pointed
out
in
that
debate
that
the
state
of
massachusetts
had
different
conflicts
of
law
or
rules
and
they
discussed
one
of
the
men
from
massachusetts
got
up
and
said
“well,
in
such-and-such
a
case
there
was
a
collision
but
the
ship
was
owned
by
a
massachusetts
corporation,
but
the
other
ship
was
not.
it
was
owned
by
a
different
state
and
that
the
rules
were
hopelessly
in
conflict,
and
they
gave
no
remedy.”
and
so,
to
answer
your
question,
i
would
think
that
if
a
delaware
ship
and
if
the
delaware
law
has
not
changed,
if
a
delaware
ship
with
a
delaware
corporation
with
a
delaware
plaintiff
were
involve,
yes,
delaware
could
give
its
citizens
a
cause
of
action
under
its
laws
for
a
death
on
the
high
seas
in
addition
to
our
supplementary
to
what
would
be
available
to
that
person
under
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act.
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
i
would
think
so.
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
that's
correct.
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
that's
right.
i
think
that
that
is
certainly
what
these
legislators
were
discussing
when
they
amended
this
provision,
so
that
the
provision
would
read
that
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
shall
not
affect
state
remedies.
that's
precisely
what
they
had
in
mind
and
they
went
through
that
discussion
just
exactly
as
i
related
it
to
you.
now,
in
the
instant
cases,
we
really
don't
have
to
see
whether
louisiana,
in
this
day
and
time,
would
apply
its
conflict
of
laws
rule
so
as
to,
in
a
given
situation,
allow
a
cause
of
action
out
there
because
the
louisiana
law
as
adopted
federal
law
is
specifically
extended
to
these
islands.
at
--
but
the
crucial
and
important
port
is
that
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
does
say
in
plain
terms
that
it
is
not
an
exclusive
remedy.
that
is
different
than
the
jones
act
which
doesn't
say.
the
jones
act,
as
you
will
regard
--
i'm
certain
the
lynn
grennan,
glasby
decisions,
the
statement
of
this
court
was
that
congress
in
enacting
the
jones
act
intended
to
make
a
uniform
remedy.
however,
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
is
different
than
the
jones
act,
in
that,
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
specifically
provides
that
the
remedy
is
not
exclusive.
now,
actually
--
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
a
uniform
basic
remedy.
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
actually,
they
used
the
word
“basic.”
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
in
this
discussion.
that
is
true.
the
man
from
massachusetts
says
“i
want
to
be
sure
i
get
something.
so,
alright,
you
got
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act,”
but
the
man
from
delaware
says
“i
don't
want
you
taking
away
what
might
be
available
in
addition
under
my
law”
and,
of
course,
there
is
nothing
unusual
whatsoever
in
allowing
curative
remedies
for
the
same
wrong.
suppose
that
a
man
has
a
chattel
or
suppose
that
a
man
is
using
someone
else's
chattel
and
damages
it,
while
the
man
who
has
suffered
the
damage,
if
he
can
come
within
the
terms
of
a
contract,
he
can
collect
under
contract.
if
not,
he
can
collect
under
tort.
but,
does
the
fact
that
he
may
have
a
remedy
under
contract
preclude
him
from
having
a
remedy
under
tort?
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
not
in
these
cases,
we
d
--
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
the
longshoremen's
act
--
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
yes,
it
does.
the
longshoremen's
act
is
strictly
an
employer-employee
act
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
the
workman's
compensation
act
in
the
--
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
negligent
parties
in
this
--
in
both
of
these
cases
are
not
the
employer.
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
then,
the
--
every
law
available
to
them,
except
of
course
the
jones
act
--
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
no,
sir,
they
don't
--
the
continental
shelf
lands
act
really
doest
say
anything
about
--
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
yes.
well,
the
state
law
--
actually,
the
state
law
is
extended.
that
is
correct,
we're
not
--
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
this
--
the
state
law
--
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
the
state
law
will
apply,
yes,
that
is
correct.
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
no,
it
doesn't
really
say
that.
it
says
where
there's
conflict.
now,
that's
the
bone,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
conflicting,
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
yes,
sir.
that's
it,
precisely.
i
am
saying
that
there
is
nothing
conflict
--
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
i
didn't
hear
you,
your
honor,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
no,
i'm
saying
that
“conflicting”
does
not
mean
“not
identical.”
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
yes,
it
does.
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
no,
comparative
negligence
is
a
rule.
your
honor,
i
--
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
no,
sir.
i
am
say
--
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
i
am
saying
--
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
what
i'm
saying,
your
honor,
is
that
perhaps,
and
this
is
the
meat
of
the
manner
right
here,
the
word
“conflict”
does
not
mean
un
--
“different”
exactly.
in
other
words,
your
honor,
if
“conflict”
meant
“different,”
in
other
words,
if
the
only
louisiana
law
that
could
apply
on
there
was
law
that
was
exactly
and
precisely
the
same
as
the
same
as
the
federal
law
that
was
already
in
existence
out
there,
what
were
the
legislators
doing
in
saying
that
the
louisiana
law
has
to
be
applied
out
there?
they
were
doing
a
vane
and
useless
thing.
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
i've
lost
my
cause
of
action
under
louisiana
law,
that's
right.
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
if
i
can
come
within
the
terms
of
louisiana
law,
i
can
get
the
benefits
of
the
louisiana
law.
if
i
can
prove,
in
this
case
and
in
any
death
case,
i
am
contributory
negligent,
i
cannot
bring
myself
within
the
terms
of
the
louisiana
law
and,
thus,
that
cause
of
action
is
out.
and,
of
course,
with
it
goes
my
claim
for
loss
of
love
and
affection.
now,
if
i
can't
come
within
the
terms
of
louisiana
law,
i
don't
get
it.
just
as
though
there
were
a
man
with
a
chattel
who
were
using
it
and
it
was
damaged.
if
the
plaintiff
can
come
within
the
terms
of
a
contract,
he
can
have
the
benefits
of
the
contract
even
though
the
remedies
might
be
different,
the
statute
of
limitations
might
be
different,
he
st
--
he
can
--
if
he
can
bring
himself
within
that
contract,
he
can
obtain
the
rights
of
the
contract.
if
he
can't
bring
himself
within
it,
he
cannot.
he
still
has
tort
remedies.
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
of
course
i'm
claiming
no
double
recovery.
i'm
saying
that
i
could
have
a
right
under
either
statutes,
just
like
an
injured
seaman
has
a
right
under
unseaworthiness
in
the
jones
act.
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
yes.
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
it
could
be,
yes.
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
yes,
one
--
the
one
in
the
high
seas
act
would
definitely
have
to
be
by
the
judge
in
admiralty,
yes.
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
if
requested.
in
other
words,
if
i
could
bring
myself
within
the
terms
of
that
law
--
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
yes,
it
would.
yes,
in
other
words,
if
i
can
bring
myself
within
the
terms
of
the
other,
i
can
come
in
--
i
can
come
and
have
its
benefits.
to
answer
justice
white's
argument,
i
take
the
position
--
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
yes,
your
honor?
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
no,
sir.
the
dore
case
is
one
of
the
cases
at
issue
here.
there
are
two
cases
which
have
come
before
this
court
now
in
a
joint
petition.
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
yes,
the
higa
case,
i
say,
is
in
my
favor,
yes.
that's
true.
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
no,
i
think
that
the
whole
matter
could
be
tried
jointly.
if
the
party
wants
a
jury
trial
under
his
state,
under
the
louisiana
federally
adopted
law,
it
could
all
be
tried
with
the
judge
sitting
in
admiralty.
and,
if
the
jury
finds
contributory
negligence,
why,
of
course,
there
is
no
cause
of
action
under
the
louisiana
law.
there
would,
of
course,
be
special
interrogatories
to
the
jury.
is
there
--
was
the
plaintiff
negligent?
if
they
answer
yes
to
that,
why,
then
the
jury
case
is
out.
if
they
say
yes,
why,
then
the
--
they
would
go
on
to
answer
quantum
and
everything
as
is
ordinary
in
a
jury
trial,
but
there
would
be
interrogatories
to
the
jury.
it
would
pose
no
procedural
problem.
there
are
cases
in
which
that's
done.
i've
cited
some
in
my
brief
in
which
a
case
was
tried
under
both
the
death
on
high
seas
act
and
under
japanese
law,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
as
one
side
of
my
district
court
case.
i
say,
in
response
to
justice
white's
question,
that
the
jones
act
is
conflict
with
or
inconsistent
with
unseaworthiness
or
damages
under
the
jones
act
or
unseaworthiness
are
not
in
conflict
with
or
inconsistent
with
maintenance
in
cure.
they're
just
overlapping
in
supplementary
remedies,
mr.
justice.
if
my
analogy
in
a
man
that
might
have
a
remedy
for
both
contract
and
tort,
they're
not
even
consistent.
it's
just
the
rule
rather
than
the
exception
to
have
possibility
of
two
or
three
remedies
--
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
if
you
can
bring
yourself
within
the
terms.
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
yes.
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
no,
i
say
that
it
is
to
the
issue
at
--
at
issue
here
as
to
the
narrow
issue
you
would
hear
there
and
here,
in
this
case,
there
is
not
even
a
second
remedy.
there
is
not
federal
remedy
for
no
“yey”
or
“ney”
as
to
loss
of
love
and
affection.
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
only
treats
pecuniary
losses.
it
does
not
even
treat
loss
of
love
and
affection
--
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
and
say
“yey”
or
“ney.”
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
yes.
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
yes,
if
you
would
say
that
the
two
laws
are
in
conflict,
yes,
your
honor,
i
would
--
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
no,
i
would
say
that,
then,
the
case
which
i've
mentioned
to
justice
fortas,
is
that
if
he
louisiana
laws
under
these
conflict
rules
allow
recover
here
then,
yes,
there
could
be
recovery
here.
they're
just
--
we
couldn't
use
the
outer
continental
shelf
vehicle.
i
see
that
i'm
running
out
of
time
and
i
do
want
to
save
some
time
for
rebuttal,
your
honor.
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
but,
i
did
want
to
save
some
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
thank
you.
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
may
it
please
the
court.
i'll
take
the
discussion
of
the
higa
case
first.
in
the
higa
case,
mr.
higa
died
on
an
airplane
enroot
from
california
to
hawaii.
he
died
when
the
plane
crash
in
the
middle
of
the
ocean.
his
dependants,
survivors,
filed
suit
under
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
and
also
claimed
a
civil
action
as
we
are
here.
the
court
--
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
the
higa
case
first
said
“we
are
looking
to
see
whether
the
conflicts
of
laws
rules
of
hawaii
apply,”
and
this
is
--
they
took
special
note
that
the
airplane
was
owned
by
a
california
company
and
said
“no.”
they
then
said
there
is
no
statute
that
would
apply
the
hawaii
death
act
to
this
area
and
there
is
no
decisional
law
that
would
apply
under
conflicts
of
laws
rules,
the
hawaii
death
act,
to
this
death.
now,
in
our
case,
we
have
both.
we've
got
a
statute.
we've
got
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act
and
we
also
have
our
death
on
the
high
seas
act.
snipes
and
loffland
brothers,
which
are
cited
as
this
circuit's
holdings,
did
not
hold
that
federal
law
is
the
exclusive
remedy.
they
only
held
that
state
law
was
not
exclusive
remedy.
in
both
of
those
cases,
the
defendant
says
the
man's
action
must
be
dismissed
under
state
law
because
he
was
contributory
and
negligent
in
one
case
and
because
the
state's
statute
of
limitations
had
run
in
the
other,
but
the
court
said
“no,
that's
not
true,
that
the
state
remedy
is
not
his
exclusive
remedy
and
that
he
does
have
a
federal
remedy.”
those
cases
didn't
say
the
federal
remedy
is
exclusive.
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
if
your
honor
please
--
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
i
think
that
that
--
that
the
word
“conflict”
is
--
the
approach
is
wrong
in
trying
to
see
where
they're
not
identical.
i
don't
think
that
the
word
“inconsistent”
meant
“not
identical.”
otherwise,
nothing
could've
been
extended
by
that
act.
i
think
“conflict”
means
“opposed
to
one
another.”
for
instance,
if
the
federal
rule
was
that
the
minerals
extracted
from
these
artificial
islands
are
the
property
of
the
federal
government
and
if
the
state
law
said
that
the
minerals
extracted
are
the
property
of
private
citizens,
they're
in
conflict
and
so,
obviously,
the
state
statute
would
have
to
give
way,
but,
as
to
a
tort
action
or
a
death
action,
why,
these
are
cumulative
supplementary
remedies.
the
cumulative
remedy
for
the
same
incident
is
the
rule
rather
than
the
exception
in
law,
as
my
example
when
a
man
may
have
a
right
in
contract
or
quasi-contract
or
tort
for
the
same
incident.
they're
not
in
conflict
of
one
another.
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
yes.
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
i
would
say
that
there's
no
inconsistency.
i
would
say
that
the
louisiana
act
would
still
be
available
if
i
could
bring
myself
with
its
terms.
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
i
think
--
i
say
that
the
rule
of
law
is
that
it
does
not
follow
that
if
there
is
one
avenue
by
which
a
destination
can
be
reached,
that
there
can
be
no
other
avenue.
i
say
that,
for
a
man
whose
chattel
is
damaged,
if
he
has
an
avenue
to
get
recovery
under
tort
--
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
that
does
not
mean
he
can't
get
it
under
contract
--
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
and
get
something
better.
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
if
they
die
or
--
diametrically
oppose,
if
one
says
that
you
--
that,
as
a
policy
of
the
united
states,
that
--
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
that
you
can't
do
this,
then
you
can't
do
it.
the
state
law
must
give
way.
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
no,
i
don't
think
that
there
is
a
diametric
opposition.
it's
just
one
route
to
recovery.
there
can
be
another
route
to
recovery
if
you
can
bring
yourself
in
these
terms.
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
well,
they're
different.
the
two
laws
are
not
identical.
there
are
many
differences.
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
beyond
the
two
years,
i
do
--
actually,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
louisiana
act
has
a
one-year
statute,
but
is
--
if
we
assume
that
the
louisiana
has
got
a
three-year
statute,
then
if
the
person
can
bring
himself
within
the
terms
of
the
louisiana
act
as
adopted
federal
law,
he
can
have
a
recovery.
in
other
words,
if
he
brings
it
within
three
years,
he
can
do
it.
in
the
instant
case,
if
a
man
brings
his
suit
within
one
year
and
if
he
is
not
contributory
negligent,
then
he's
entitled
to
his
louisiana
recovery.
if
he
can't
come
within
the
t
--
within
the
terms
of
the
statute,
if
he's
contributory
negligent,
as
i
say,
he
cannot
have
his
recovery
under
louisiana
law.
he's
just
--
if
he
can't
bring
himself
within
the
terms
of
that
act,
just
like
in
a
contract
situation,
if
he
can't
come
within
the
terms
of
the
contract,
he's
got
no
contract
remedy.
he's
only
got
a
tort
remedy.
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
no,
sir.
i
--
the
only
real
--
the
only
question
is
the
word
“inconsistent
with.”
if
“inconsistent
with”
means
“opposed,”
why
then,
that's
one
thing.
if
it
means
“not
identical,”
why
then,
of
course,
then
that's
another
thing.
but,
i
say
that
the
word
“inconsistent
with”
can't
mean
“identical”
or
there
could
be
no
law
whatsoever
extended
out
there.
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
because,
then,
the
legislature
was
wasting
its
breath
and
ink
in
extending
that
the
law
--
in
saying
that
the
louisiana
law
shall
be
extended
out
there
because
it's
got
to
have
a
different
result
or
what's
the
good
of
extending
it
out
there?
if
it
doesn't
have
any
different
result
in
extending
the
louisiana
law
out
there,
then
why
in
the
world
extend
it
out
there?
the
legislature
had
to
mean
something
in
saying
that
that
law
is
extended.
mr.
philip
e.
henderson
yes,
but
then
it
would
--
then
you'd
have
a
different
result
by
the
louisiana
law
that's
out
there.
it
would
be
not
identical
with
the
federal
law
that's
out
there.
it
would
be
--
you'd
have
a
different
result.
i
say
the
cumulative
remedies
or
the
rule
in
law
rather
than
a
single
avenue
had
recovered
it.
thank
you
very
much.
