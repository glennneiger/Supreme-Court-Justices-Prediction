justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
henderson,
may
i
ask,
whom
are
we
indebted
for
this?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
respondent?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
whose
fight
it
is,
this
fight.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and,
it
seems
to
me,
you're
going
--
if
i
understand
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
analysis
that
mr.
justice
white
has
just
suggested,
the
court
of
appeals
held
that,
to
answer
justice
black's
question,
the
only
remedy
is
the
federal
remedy
under
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act.
there
is
no
state
remedy
under
section
7
or
otherwise
of
the
high
seas
act.
the
only
remedy
is
the
federal
remedy.
isn't
that
what
the
court
of
appeals
held?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
surprised
to
hear
you
suggest
that,
nevertheless,
there
may
be
a
state
remedy
if
the
proceeding
is
brought
in
a
state
court.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
thought
that's
what
you
answered
to
mr.
justice
black.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there's
just
isn't
any
recovery
under
state
law.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
that
there
is
a
federal
statute,
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act.
