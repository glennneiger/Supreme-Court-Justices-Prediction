are
going

have
any
impact
beyond
the
resolution

in

words,
anything
in
the
way
of
any
basic
law
in
conflicts
of
this
nature
between
the
secretary
and
agencies
elsewhere
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,

going
to
be
helped
however
we
come
out
with
this
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
mr.
martz
a
question
i
asked
mr.
nagin
of
whether
we
may
decide
here,
would
it
have
any
significance
beyond
this
conflict,
this
local
conflict?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

the
latter
being
under
what
is
it,
paragraph

yes.

mr.

wait
a
minute,
i
don't
get
this.
if
the
tariff
is
filed,
is
that
subject
to
the
commission
approval
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,

well
then
--
well
then,
perhaps
i
misunderstood
your
answer
to
the
chief
justice.
it
has
to
be
it.
we
could
be
reviewed
by
the
commission,
could
it
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
could
be
rejected
as
a
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
even
though
it
had
been
pursuant
to
an
arrangement
between
the
secretary
of
the
interior
and
the
private
concessionaire?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
why
does
in
fact
go
so
far
if
you
were
right
and
the
exemption
does
not
apply
as
to
mean
that
your
commission
can
exclude
this
service
if
it's
a
transportation
service
if
this
choice
of
the
secretary
is
to
franchise
that
to
a
private
operator,
doesn't
it
go
that
far?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you
--
what
you're
telling
us
is,
that
isn't
the
way
the
commission
acts?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
that
maybe
but
in
terms
of
power,
if
you
are
right
and
the
exemption
doesn't
apply
you
can
still
say
to
that
concessionaire
“no,
we
will
not
give
you
a
certificate.”
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
in
your
brief?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
page,
may
i
ask?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

right.
justice
william
j.
brennan,

so
that
if
that
--
if
operation
by
the
secretary
is
not
involved
at
all
on
either
the
franchise
or
the
compact,
then
it's
immaterial
where
the
operation
by
the
secretary
is
by
himself
directly
or
by
him
to
an
independent
context.
