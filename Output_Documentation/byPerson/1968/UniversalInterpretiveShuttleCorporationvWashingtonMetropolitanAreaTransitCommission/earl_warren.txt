mr.

chief

earl
warren
you
divide
your
own
time
so
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
we
will
be
advised
to
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
this
kind
of
service
was
rendered
in
yellowstone
national
park
or
yusamite
or
glacier
national

would
there
be
any
--
any
reason
to
say
that
the
government
couldn't
do
it
without
going
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
i
understood
you
to
say
that
if
the
government
itself
performed
this
service
in
washington
that
it
would
be
alright.
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
in
that
respect
couldn't
it
do
what
it
does
in
your
simile
or
yellow
stone
park
delegates
that
to
a
concessionaire
and
have
that
be
act
of
the
government?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
would
do
what?
i
didn't
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
what
power
of
regulation
would
your
commission
have
over
these
people
if
you
win
in
this
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
character
of
service?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
kind
of
service?
chief
justice
earl
warren
everything.
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
secretary
of
the

then
would
be
divested?
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
his
regulatory
powers
would
enact,
would
he?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
asked
the
question
would
he?
chief
justice
earl
warren
changes
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
declare
it?
would
you
determine
the
fares?
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
be
obliged
to
follow
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
be
obliged
to
follow
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
would
have
to
be?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
the
fault
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
suppose
the
secretary
of
the
interior
in
order
to
take
of
children
who
visit
question
and
said
we
want
a
five
cent
fare
and
the
commission
said
no,
we
don't
think
that
that's
equitable,
we
want
a
10-cent
fare
and
there
was
a
clash
there
between
commission
and
the
secretary
of
the
interior,
who
would
prevail?
chief
justice
earl
warren
commission
would
prevail?
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
the
secretary
of
the
interior
propose
to
have
this
service
run
on
the
highways
of
the
city?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
mean
whether
it's
in
or
out
of
the
park?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
understood
counsel
on
the
other
side
to
say
that
the
only
place
that
they
--
they
went
on
--
the
public
highways
was
to
go
across
third
and
fifth
and
--
lets
say
seventh
and
ninth
and
fourteenth,
something
like
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
across
those
street,
they
did
not
run
--
run
along
those
and
on
those
--
on
those
streets
and
that
those
streets
were
only
made
public
streets
subject
to
the
regulation
of
the
department
of
the
interior.
now,
am
i
--
i
wonder
if
i'm
wrong
about
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright.
now
is
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
true
or
untrue?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
lie,
what
--
read
that
please.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
now
isn't
that
third,
fifth,
seventh,
ninth
and
fourteenth
or
whatever
those
--
those
across
the
streets
are
across
the
mall?
wouldn't
it
include
those?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i'm
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
not
necessarily.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
but
that
--
that's
a
different
thing.
chief
justice
earl
warren
these
streets
as
i
understand
bisect
the
mall
that
some
years
ago
did
not
or
were
not
bisect
it
and
that
the
congress
in
order
to
take
care
of
that
situation
said
that
--
that
the
mall
might
be
bisected
provided
the
secretary
of
the
interior
had
control
and
jurisdiction
over
those
streets.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
now,
it
hasn't
done
that
for
the
streets
between
--
between
the
mall
and
fourth
theater
or
between
the
mall
and
the
old
union
station
or
any
of
those
--
any
of
those
places
and
if
they
want
that,
i
suppose
they'd
have
to
go
and
get
the
statutory
permission
to
do
it,
wouldn't
they?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
then,
the
street
across
the
mall
separates
the
mall?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
then,
that
they
might
be
included
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that
--
you're
not
separating
the
mall.
when
you
separate
it,
when
you
have
a
street
between
it
and
the
business
center.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
what
--
i
didn't
get
that
last
statement.
i
didn't
understand
that
last
statement
that
you
just
made.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
exhibit
b?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
that
is
what
the
constitution
avenue
you
say?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
does
separate
the
government
(inaudible)
holding,
not
just
the
mall
but
the
government
grounds
because
on
both
sides
are
--
of
that
of
constitution
avenue
on
those
streets
are
--
are
government
building.
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
this
prohibit
you
from
doing
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
is
that
--
is
constitution
avenue
where
these
buses
run
speaking
now
of
the
--
of
a
new
components
possible,
is
that
street
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
the
way
it
appears
in
the
statute,
dual
--
dual
jurisdiction
or
does
the
statute
say
that
the
secretary
of
the
interior
shall
have
jurisdiction
over
and
that
these
other
people
who
use
it
use
it
in
accordance
with
regulation
of
the
--
of
the
secretary
of
the

chief

mr.

you
may
continue
your

chief

excuse
me.
i

you
told

yesterday
that
if

then
that
you
--
that

chief

what
is
the
difference?
chief

you
may
sir.
mr.

chief

who
issued

--
who

here?
chief

the

the

is
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
know
but
isn't
the
congress
authorized
that
they
prepare
the
exact
commission?
chief
justice
earl
warren
or
did
the
--
or
did
the
commission
itself
write
the
franchise?
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
other
words,
what
i'm
trying
to
get
is
this,
are
we
governed
by
the
breadth
of
the

or
we
are
--
are
we
governed
by
the

of
the

chief

now,
just
tell
me,
just
tell
me
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
--
what
is
the
statute
that
wrote
that?
chief
justice
earl

and
does
that
contain
in
high
purpose
of
the

chief
justice
earl
warren
it
does?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
sir.
chief

yes,

that's
