mr.
manuel
j.
davis
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
cover
an
issue
that
was
not
covered
but
mr.
cunningham
which
was
referred
to
by
counsel
for
the
appellants
in
this
proceeding
namely
the
issue
as
to
whether
not
the
congressional
franchise
granted
to
transit.
d.c.
transit
protect
it
against
such
applicants
as
here
today
for
the
for
hire
transportation
operation
which
universal
proposes
perform
within
the
district
of
columbia.
d.c.
transit
franchise,
that's
public
law
757,
70
stat
598
grants
a
franchise
to
d.c.
transit
to
perform
a
mass
transportation
service
in
the
district
of
columbia
and
in
the
areas
which
go
on
to
comprise
the
metropolitan
district.
now
that
particular
authority
set
out
in
section
1
of
the
said
franchise.
two
other
sections
in
this
franchise
are
maturely
important
to
the
issue
which
i
raise
namely
section
3
and
section
6.
if
i
may
skip
section
3
for
a
moment,
section
6
grants
to
d.c.
transit,
the
additional
authority
known
as
charter
sightseeing
and
contract
authority
within
the
areas
that
i
have
described.
now,
section
3
of
the
compact
says
that
no
authority
or
certificate
shall
be
granted
to
any
applicant
for
that
authority.
if
it
intends
to
operate
a
given
route
over
in
a
fixed
schedule
unless
the
commission,
that
is
the
wmatc
finds
that
public
convenience
and
necessity
demands
of
such
certificate.
now,
the
lower
court
in
treating
this
question
attempted
to
allude
to
the
fact
and
did
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
mass
transit
referred
solely
to
transit
within
the
district
of
columbia.
now
i
am
certain
that
a
reading
of
that
section
will
show
that
mass
transit
was
not
restricted
to
transit
solely
within
the
district
of
columbia
or
to
residents
in
the
district
of
columbia
but
applied
to
anyone
within
the
areas
that
we
serve
and
for
any
of
the
services
that
we
serve
as
a
result
of
the
franchise
and
the
certificates
which
were
eventually
issued
to
us
by
the
wmatc
as
a
result
of
the
said
certificate.
the
section
3
which
becomes
the
paramount
section
in
this
case
as
far
as
our
argument
is
concerned
definitely
points
out
that
the
service
which
they
must
endeavor
to
render
must
be
by
a
given
route
are
over
a
fixed
schedule.
now
--
mr.
manuel
j.
davis
yes,
sir.
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge.
mr.
manuel
j.
davis
if
they
are
running
bus
operations,
they
must
get
certificates
from
the
wmatc,
yes
sir.
now,
(inaudible)
to
visualize
the
underlying
reason
as
to
why
the
lower
court
endeavored
to
single
out
section
6
as
not
being
protected
by
section
3
of
the
compact.
perhaps,
i
think
because
was
in
a
separate
section
in
the
compact
and
i'm
sorry,
the
franchise
was
set
out
at
a
later
time
but
the
court
seem
to
conclude
that
is
a
general
reason,
it
would
not
necessarily
fall
within
the
protection
afforded
to
d.c.
transit
under
section
3
of
the
compact.
we
have
endeavored
and
i
believe
you
will
find
in
our
brief
sufficient
law
and
cases
to
show
that
it
it's
possible
for
a
sightseeing
operation
to
be
over
a
given
route
and
on
a
fixed
schedule.
that's
easy
to
visualize,
the
courts
have
said,
that
is
possible
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
d.c.
transit
does
it
itself
everyday
at
a
given
hour
a
particular
sightseeing
trip
goes
to
the
mall
area
which
begins
outside
of
the
mall
and
it
continues
around
the
areas
that
are
described
by
the
respondent,
i'm
sorry,
by
the
appellant
as
to
the
route,
it
will
operate
if
the
service
--
if
the
authority
is
granted
to
the
--
to
them
by
the
secretary
and
it's
held
to
be
valid.
mr.
manuel
j.
davis
the
congress
of
the
united
states
sir.
mr.
manuel
j.
davis
an
act
of
congress
sir.
mr.
manuel
j.
davis
yes,
sir.
the
--
the
--
mr.
manuel
j.
davis
the
franchise
--
mr.
manuel
j.
davis
of
the
franchise
i
say
it
sir
because
you'll
find
--
mr.
manuel
j.
davis
in
the
franchise.
mr.
manuel
j.
davis
the
statute
to
which
i
refer
sir
is
the
public
law
757.
mr.
manuel
j.
davis
yes,
sir.
mr.
manuel
j.
davis
yes,
sir.
mr.
manuel
j.
davis
now,
we
get
to
the
point
and
we're
bound
by
the
term.
mr.
manuel
j.
davis
thank
you.
mr.
manuel
j.
davis
thank
you
sir.
the
--
we
get
to
section
3
and
there
we
must
find
or
determine
as
to
whether
or
not
the
service
which
is
contemplated
is
over
giving
or
a
--
on
a
fixed
schedule.
now
sir
as
to
that,
the
district
court
went
to
great
pains
to
set
out
the
description
of
the
given
route
and
so
we
didn't
even
go
any
further
than
that
over
which
the
respondent
will
operate.
now,
this
appears
on
page
32
of
our
brief.
the
fact
that
universe
--
sorry,
strike
that
sir.
the
fact
that
the
secretary
has
designated
a
given
route
is
further
evidenced
by
the
respondent's
vice
president
when
he
enumerated
the
11
points
of
interest,
it
will
operate
over.
mr.
manuel
j.
davis
yes,
sir.
universal
--
mr.
manuel
j.
davis
yes,
sir.
mr.
manuel
j.
davis
universal
was
advised
by
the
wmatc
that
if
it
desired
to
render
the
service,
it
would
first
have
to
secure
certificate
from
the
commission
and
you
don't
--
mr.
manuel
j.
davis
i
say
it's
in
dispute
by
universal
who
says
they
do
not
have
to
get
such
a
certificate.
mr.
manuel
j.
davis
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
manuel
j.
davis
they
haven't
got
to
that
point
in
argument.
we
have
taken
the
position
that
under
any
circumstances,
they
must
apply
to
the
commission
for
a
certificate.
mr.
manuel
j.
davis
we
take
that
position,
we
can't
stop
him
from
making
a
contract
but
we
believe
that
this
franchise
does
protect
us
as
far
as
the
operation
by
a
concessionaire
or
a
private
person
in
this
area.
mr.
manuel
j.
davis
or
by
the
secretary
himself
and
that
--
mr.
manuel
j.
davis
yes,
sir.
as
in
that
respect,
we're
different
from
mr.
cunningham.
we
say
the
secretary
has
no
authority
and
no
one
has
yet
has
come
up
with
any
law
whether
it
be
case
of
statute
law
which
says
the
secretary
has
any
authority
to
operate
a
service.
mr.
manuel
j.
davis
subject
to
section
3
of
the
franchise.
we
are
bound
by
that
section.
now,
if
the
commission
in
its
wisdom
where
to
find
the
public
means
and
necessity,
require
the
service,
it
doesn't
necessarily
say
they
must
give
it
to
us
but
it's
--
but
there
is
a
section
in
the
compact
which
says
that
nothing
in
the
compact
shall
abridge
or
take
away
from
d.c.
transit
the
rights
which
they
held
under
the
franchise.
there
is
such
a
section
and
there
is
another
section
under
the
compact
that
says
that
the
commission
shall
not
grant
the
right
to
an
applicant
to
run
over
the
roots
of
another
operator
without
first
giving
that
operator
the
right
and
opportunity
to
render
the
service
so
that
we
feel
our
protection
lies
within
the
franchise
and
the
compact.
mr.
manuel
j.
davis
that's
correct
sir.
that's
my
--
mr.
manuel
j.
davis
that's
correct
sir.
yes,
sir.
mr.
manuel
j.
davis
yes,
sir.
it
definitely
goes
beyond
that.
we
contend
definitely
has
no
such
authority
to
operate
the
service.
mr.
manuel
j.
davis
on
a
fixed
schedule.
mr.
manuel
j.
davis
that's
correct
sir.
that's
right.
mr.
manuel
j.
davis
we
have
authority
from
this
commission
to
operate
sightseeing
services
in
the
mall.
we
hold
such
a
certificate.
we
hold
in
addition
10
different
certificates
--
oh,
i'm
sorry,
one
certificate
for
10
regular
route
operations
in
the
mall
and
i
would
say
that
to
the
extent
that
universal
was
permitted
to
operate
in
the
mall.
it
would
deprive
transit's
regular
everyday
riders
of
the
opportunity
of
riding
exclusively
with
d.c.
transit
even
in
the
mall.
mr.
manuel
j.
davis
he
does
sir
under
the
compact.
the
compact
reserves
to
the
secretary
after
suspending
all
the
laws
of
the
united
states
which
have
any
applicability
to
the
transportation
in
this
area,
it
says
that
the
ordinary
and
normal
police
powers
are
reserved
to
and
then
enumerates
various
parties,
one
of
which
is
the
--
mr.
manuel
j.
davis
that's
correct.
that's
exactly
what
the
compact
says.
mr.
manuel
j.
davis
it
reserves
nothing
like
that
to
him
to
my
knowledge.
that's
right
in
the
compact.
now,
as
to
the
competitive
feature,
i
would
like
to
mention
--
mr.
manuel
j.
davis
it
does
sir.
mr.
manuel
j.
davis
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
manuel
j.
davis
that
is
correct
sir.
now,
after
the
--
whether
or
not
there's
--
mr.
manuel
j.
davis
thank
you
sir
and
i
do
want
to
thank
you
and
the
court
for
the
additional
time
sir.
mr.
manuel
j.
davis
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
cover
an
issue
that
was
not
covered
but
mr.
cunningham
which
was
referred
to
by
counsel
for
the
appellants
in
this
proceeding
namely
the
issue
as
to
whether
not
the
congressional
franchise
granted
to
transit.
d.c.
transit
protect
it
against
such
applicants
as
here
today
for
the
for
hire
transportation
operation
which
universal
proposes
perform
within
the
district
of
columbia.
d.c.
transit
franchise,
that's
public
law
757,
70
stat
598
grants
a
franchise
to
d.c.
transit
to
perform
a
mass
transportation
service
in
the
district
of
columbia
and
in
the
areas
which
go
on
to
comprise
the
metropolitan
district.
now
that
particular
authority
set
out
in
section
1
of
the
said
franchise.
two
other
sections
in
this
franchise
are
maturely
important
to
the
issue
which
i
raise
namely
section
3
and
section
6.
if
i
may
skip
section
3
for
a
moment,
section
6
grants
to
d.c.
transit,
the
additional
authority
known
as
charter
sightseeing
and
contract
authority
within
the
areas
that
i
have
described.
now,
section
3
of
the
compact
says
that
no
authority
or
certificate
shall
be
granted
to
any
applicant
for
that
authority.
if
it
intends
to
operate
a
given
route
over
in
a
fixed
schedule
unless
the
commission,
that
is
the
wmatc
finds
that
public
convenience
and
necessity
demands
of
such
certificate.
now,
the
lower
court
in
treating
this
question
attempted
to
allude
to
the
fact
and
did
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
mass
transit
referred
solely
to
transit
within
the
district
of
columbia.
now
i
am
certain
that
a
reading
of
that
section
will
show
that
mass
transit
was
not
restricted
to
transit
solely
within
the
district
of
columbia
or
to
residents
in
the
district
of
columbia
but
applied
to
anyone
within
the
areas
that
we
serve
and
for
any
of
the
services
that
we
serve
as
a
result
of
the
franchise
and
the
certificates
which
were
eventually
issued
to
us
by
the
wmatc
as
a
result
of
the
said
certificate.
the
section
3
which
becomes
the
paramount
section
in
this
case
as
far
as
our
argument
is
concerned
definitely
points
out
that
the
service
which
they
must
endeavor
to
render
must
be
by
a
given
route
are
over
a
fixed
schedule.
now
--
mr.
manuel
j.
davis
yes,
sir.
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge.
mr.
manuel
j.
davis
if
they
are
running
bus
operations,
they
must
get
certificates
from
the
wmatc,
yes
sir.
now,
(inaudible)
to
visualize
the
underlying
reason
as
to
why
the
lower
court
endeavored
to
single
out
section
6
as
not
being
protected
by
section
3
of
the
compact.
perhaps,
i
think
because
was
in
a
separate
section
in
the
compact
and
i'm
sorry,
the
franchise
was
set
out
at
a
later
time
but
the
court
seem
to
conclude
that
is
a
general
reason,
it
would
not
necessarily
fall
within
the
protection
afforded
to
d.c.
transit
under
section
3
of
the
compact.
we
have
endeavored
and
i
believe
you
will
find
in
our
brief
sufficient
law
and
cases
to
show
that
it
it's
possible
for
a
sightseeing
operation
to
be
over
a
given
route
and
on
a
fixed
schedule.
that's
easy
to
visualize,
the
courts
have
said,
that
is
possible
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
d.c.
transit
does
it
itself
everyday
at
a
given
hour
a
particular
sightseeing
trip
goes
to
the
mall
area
which
begins
outside
of
the
mall
and
it
continues
around
the
areas
that
are
described
by
the
respondent,
i'm
sorry,
by
the
appellant
as
to
the
route,
it
will
operate
if
the
service
--
if
the
authority
is
granted
to
the
--
to
them
by
the
secretary
and
it's
held
to
be
valid.

mr.

mr.

of
the

i
say
it
sir
because
you'll
find

mr.

in
the
franchise.
mr.
manuel
j.
davis
the
statute
to
which
i
refer
sir
is
the
public
law
757.
mr.
manuel
j.

yes,
sir.
mr.
manuel
j.
davis
yes,
sir.
mr.
manuel
j.
davis
now,
we
get
to
the
point
and
we're
bound
by
the
term.
mr.
manuel
j.
davis
thank
you.
mr.
manuel
j.
davis
thank
you
sir.
the
--
we
get
to
section
3
and
there
we
must
find
or
determine
as
to
whether
or
not
the
service
which
is
contemplated
is
over
giving
or
a
--
on
a
fixed
schedule.
now
sir
as
to
that,
the
district
court
went
to
great
pains
to
set
out
the
description
of
the
given
route
and
so
we
didn't
even
go
any
further
than
that
over
which
the
respondent
will
operate.
now,
this
appears
on
page
32
of
our
brief.
the
fact
that
universe
--
sorry,
strike
that
sir.
the
fact
that
the
secretary
has
designated
a
given
route
is
further
evidenced
by
the
respondent's
vice
president
when
he
enumerated
the
11
points
of
interest,
it
will
operate
over.
mr.
manuel
j.
davis
yes,
sir.
universal
--
mr.
manuel
j.
davis
yes,
sir.
mr.
manuel
j.
davis
universal
was
advised
by
the
wmatc
that
if
it
desired
to
render
the
service,
it
would
first
have
to
secure
certificate
from
the
commission
and
you
don't
--
mr.
manuel
j.
davis
i
say
it's
in
dispute
by
universal
who
says
they
do
not
have
to
get
such
a
certificate.
mr.
manuel
j.
davis
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
manuel
j.
davis
they
haven't
got
to
that
point
in
argument.
we
have
taken
the
position
that
under
any
circumstances,
they
must
apply
to
the
commission
for
a
certificate.
mr.
manuel
j.
davis
we
take
that
position,
we
can't
stop
him
from
making
a
contract
but
we
believe
that
this
franchise
does
protect
us
as
far
as
the
operation
by
a
concessionaire
or
a
private
person
in
this
area.
mr.
manuel
j.
davis
or
by
the
secretary
himself
and
that
--
mr.
manuel
j.
davis
yes,
sir.
as
in
that
respect,
we're
different
from
mr.
cunningham.
we
say
the
secretary
has
no
authority
and
no
one
has
yet
has
come
up
with
any
law
whether
it
be
case
of
statute
law
which
says
the
secretary
has
any
authority
to
operate
a
service.
mr.
manuel
j.
davis
subject
to
section
3
of
the
franchise.
we
are
bound
by
that
section.
now,
if
the
commission
in
its
wisdom
where
to
find
the
public
means
and
necessity,
require
the
service,
it
doesn't
necessarily
say
they
must
give
it
to
us
but
it's
--
but
there
is
a
section
in
the
compact
which
says
that
nothing
in
the
compact
shall
abridge
or
take
away
from
d.c.
transit
the
rights
which
they
held
under
the
franchise.
there
is
such
a
section
and
there
is
another
section
under
the
compact
that
says
that
the
commission
shall
not
grant
the
right
to
an
applicant
to
run
over
the
roots
of
another
operator
without
first
giving
that
operator
the
right
and
opportunity
to
render
the
service
so
that
we
feel
our
protection
lies
within
the
franchise
and
the
compact.
mr.
manuel
j.
davis
that's
correct
sir.
that's
my
--
mr.
manuel
j.
davis
that's
correct
sir.
yes,
sir.
mr.
manuel
j.
davis
yes,
sir.
it
definitely
goes
beyond
that.
we
contend
definitely
has
no
such
authority
to
operate
the
service.
mr.
manuel
j.
davis
on
a
fixed
schedule.
mr.
manuel
j.
davis
that's
correct
sir.
that's
right.
mr.
manuel
j.
davis
we
have
authority
from
this
commission
to
operate
sightseeing
services
in
the
mall.
we
hold
such
a
certificate.
we
hold
in
addition
10
different
certificates
--
oh,
i'm
sorry,
one
certificate
for
10
regular
route
operations
in
the
mall
and
i
would
say
that
to
the
extent
that
universal
was
permitted
to
operate
in
the
mall.
it
would
deprive
transit's
regular
everyday
riders
of
the
opportunity
of
riding
exclusively
with
d.c.
transit
even
in
the
mall.
mr.
manuel
j.
davis
he
does
sir
under
the
compact.
the
compact
reserves
to
the
secretary
after
suspending
all
the
laws
of
the
united
states
which
have
any
applicability
to
the
transportation
in
this
area,
it
says
that
the
ordinary
and
normal
police
powers
are
reserved
to
and
then
enumerates
various
parties,
one
of
which
is
the
--
mr.
manuel
j.
davis
that's
correct.
that's
exactly
what
the
compact
says.
mr.
manuel
j.
davis
it
reserves
nothing
like
that
to
him
to
my
knowledge.
that's
right
in
the
compact.
now,
as
to
the
competitive
feature,
i
would
like
to
mention
--
mr.
manuel
j.
davis
it
does
sir.
mr.
manuel
j.
davis
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
manuel
j.
davis
that
is
correct
sir.
now,
after
the
--
whether
or
not
there's
--
mr.
manuel
j.
davis
thank
you
sir
and
i
do
want
to
thank
you
and
the
court
for
the
additional
time
sir.
