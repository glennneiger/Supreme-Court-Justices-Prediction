justice
abe
fortas
do
you
say
it
wouldn't
be?
justice
abe
fortas
i
thought
that
perhaps
i
incorrectly
recall
this
but
as
i
read
the
papers
here,
i
thought
that
that
exemption
applied
only
to
transportation,
the
federal
government's
only
personnel?
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i'm
talking
about
the
express
exemption,
how
does
that
lead?
justice
abe
fortas
i
see,
and
it
does
--
does
not
limit
--
expressly
limited
to
employees
in
there?
justice
abe
fortas
you
said
--
you
said
compact,
you
mean
contract?
justice
abe
fortas
compact.
there
is
a
compact
in
this
--
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
martz,
suppose
the
secretary
would
decide
that
would
better
be
a
good
idea
to
have
this
sort
of
interpretive
tram
service,
serving
all
of
the
capital
park
areas,
all
of
the
park
areas
under
his
jurisdiction
in
the
district
of
columbia.
would
the
principle
there
be
any
different
with
respect
to
problem
that
we
have
before
us?
justice
abe
fortas
he
would
then
have
to
use
the
streets
in
the
district?
justice
abe
fortas
well
he
--
he
would
have
the
authority
there
just
as
much
as
he
has
at
in
the
present
case,
wouldn't
he?
justice
abe
fortas
particularly,
if
you
assume
that
in
the
present
case,
these
trams
will
have
to
use
some
city
street.
justice
abe
fortas
by
congress
to
do
it?
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
you
think
this
would
be
a
different
and
substantially
more
difficult
case
if
the
operation
of
these
trams
required
the
use
of
city
street
in
the
district
outside
of
the
park
area?
justice
abe
fortas
why,
why?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
similarly
then
he
could
provide
the
service
to
all
of
the
capital
parks
because
that's
transportation
by
the
federal
government?
that
is
--
that
is
correct
your
honor.
this
is
all
by
legis
--
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
in
your
submission,
the
secretary
of
the
interior
could
now
set
up
an
interpretive
tram
service
to
all
of
the
parks
in
the
district
of
columbia
on
his
jurisdiction
even
though
that
would
require
various
substantial
use
of
the
city
streets
and
to
do
that,
he
would
not
have
to
obtain
the
authority
of
all
clear
with
the
washington
metropolitan
area
transit
commission?
justice
abe
fortas
and
by
exception
you
mean
its
federal
government
exception?
justice
abe
fortas
you
don't
really
--
you
don't
really
mean
to
include
the
word
national
in
that
sense,
do
you?
justice
abe
fortas
the
icc
certainly
still
exists
and
has
jurisdiction
--
justice
abe
fortas
in
the
affected
area?
justice
abe
fortas
so
far
as
this
--
as
the
purely
inter
urban
so
to
speak
or
the
inter
area
--
justice
abe
fortas
in
prior
area
of
trans
--
transportation
is
concern
but
not
otherwise.
justice
abe
fortas
do
you
have
any
control
over
the
district
of
columbia
vehicles?
justice
abe
fortas
official.
justice
abe
fortas
or
maryland
or
virginia?
justice
abe
fortas
or
the
fed
--
or
the
federal
government.
justice
abe
fortas
you
don't
have
any
control
of
any
of
those
and
that's
by
virtue
of
article
12
paragraph
182.
justice
abe
fortas
now,
how
do
you
construe
that
provision
of
that
was
subject
of
colloquy
here?
transportation
by
the
federal
government
is
exempted
from
your
jurisdiction
from
that
article.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
justice
fortas,
we
follow
the
traditional
concepts
of
regulation
that
has
been
imposed
nationally
as
well
as
within
the
state
concepts.
that
is
that
where
a
transportation
service
is
operated
by
the
government
in
its
own
vehicles
by
its
own
personnel
that
that
--
that
transportation
is
by
the
federal
government
or
by
the
state
government
or
by
the
county
government
--
justice
abe
fortas
right.
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
--
justice
abe
fortas
there
is
no
park
service
itself
operated,
owned
and
operated
these
trams
and
provided
this
interpretive
service
on
the
mall,
would
you
claim
jurisdiction?
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
actually,
maybe
this
case
can
be
disposed
off
on
that
one
question.
if
we
should
believe
for
example
that
the
correct
construction
of
the
compact
is
that
whatever
the
federal
government
may
do
directly
is
exempt,
therefore,
whatever
the
federal
government
may
do
through
a
concessionaire
is
also
exempt
that
would
dispose
of
the
case.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
we
didn't
write
the
compact,
we
have
to
read
it.
justice
abe
fortas
i
suppose
a
commission
authorize
somebody
else,
d.c.
transit
or
somebody
to
provide
tourist
service
on
the
mall,
i
guess
you
wouldn't
do
that,
wouldn't
you?
suppose
--
suppose
you
authorize
the
d.c.
transit
to
do
that
and
the
secretary
of
interior
says
that
because
of
my
responsibility
on
the
national
parks,
i'd
like
to
point
out
section
such
as
it
take
tourist
through
it
so
this
thomas
jefferson
memorial.
first,
does
your
commission
have
any
control
over
the
script
that's
used
in
by
the
tour
guides?
justice
abe
fortas
i
would
tell
them.
justice
abe
fortas
i
wasn't
talking
about
a
substitute
for
money.
justice
abe
fortas
i
suppose
that
the
secretary
of
the
interior,
you
would
agree
that
the
secretary
of
the
interior
had
a
legitimate
interest
i
suppose
on
having
thomas
jefferson
memorial
pointed
out
to
tourist.
justice
abe
fortas
now,
but
it
have
no
way
of
seeing
that
that
was
done
unless
the
tourist
service
were
under
his
jurisdiction,
would
he?
justice
abe
fortas
you
have
no
interest,
no
jurisdiction,
they
have
jurisdiction.
justice
abe
fortas
alright.
justice
abe
fortas
but
the
secretary
of
the
interior
might
have,
you'd
agree
with
that?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
what
sector
proposes
to
provide
here
is
not
exclusive
of
other
services
of
the
sort,
is
it?
suppose
the
universal
service
here
of
--
were
performing
under
this
contract,
d.c.
transit
or
sightseeing
service
or
one
sort
or
another
could
continue
to
operate
in
the
mall
area,
could
they
not?
justice
abe
fortas
has
he
--
justice
abe
fortas
has
he
ever
done
that?
has
he
done
that?
justice
abe
fortas
has
there
--
justice
abe
fortas
has
there
any
provision
of
the
secretary's
contract
with
universal
by
which
that
is
a
--
an
exclusive
service
that
they
have
exclusive
rights
to
run
tourist
in
the
mall?
justice
abe
fortas
i
know
but
that's
not
what
i'm
asking.
i'm
asking
whether
a
contract
so
provide
but
i
guess
i've
forgotten
i'll
left
to
check
the
contract
if
you
don't
know
the
answer.
justice
abe
fortas
is
this
route
being
use
now
by
the
national
park
service?
is
this
a
correct
representation
of
the
route
now
being
used
by
the
national
park
service?
justice
abe
fortas
is
it
operating
on
constitution
avenue?
justice
abe
fortas
as
shown
on
this
map?
justice
abe
fortas
do
all
of
the
sightseeing
agencies
in
the
district
of
columbia
obtain
franchise
or
something
in
the
sort
from
the
commission?
justice
abe
fortas
you
mean
to
say
all
of
them
that
we
see
on
the
street,
not
the
individual.
how
about
the
individuals
who
run?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
is
there
really
any
difference
of
opinion
on
the
question
that
you're
now
covering
that
is
to
say
that
if
universal
has
to
be
considered
and
it's
purely
private
capacity
and
not
as
an
agent
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior,
it
would
have
to
get
the
necessary
authority
from
the
commission,
is
there
any
conflict
as
to
that?
justice
abe
fortas
there
is
a
conflict
as
to
that?
justice
abe
fortas
why?
justice
abe
fortas
no,
i
didn't
make
my
question
clear
i
guess.
if
you
assume
that
universal
is
operating
in
a
purely
private
capacity
and
not
as
the
alter
ego
of
the
secretary,
there
is
no
dispute
is
there
that
universal
would
have
to
go
to
the
commission
and
get
authority
to
perform
the
service
that
is
here
involved,
is
that
in
dispute
or
is
it
not?
justice
abe
fortas
well
that's
the
question,
they
said
that
they
are
operating
as
the
alter
ego
of
the
secretary,
don't
they?
justice
abe
fortas
now
do
they
--
if
they
were
not
operating
as
the
alter
ego
of
the
secretary,
would
they
still
contend
that
they
do
not
have
to
get
the
permission
of
the
commission?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
then
you
would
feel
that
if
the
secretary
operated
this,
the
secretary
undertook
to
operate
this
service
himself
directly,
he
could
not
do
it
without
violating
the
terms
of
--
he
could
not
do
it.
justice
abe
fortas
your
position
differs
from
the
position
of
your
colleague?
justice
abe
fortas
it's
important
for
us
to
know
that
that
shows
the
thrust
of
your
argument.
justice
abe
fortas
that's
your
real
point
as
i
understand
it
is
that
the
charter
did
not
include
the
--
this
service
and
the
park
enclave
which
is
at
issue
here,
is
that
it?
justice
abe
fortas
do
you
say
it
wouldn't
be?
justice
abe
fortas
i
thought
that
perhaps
i
incorrectly
recall
this
but
as
i
read
the
papers
here,
i
thought
that
that
exemption
applied
only
to
transportation,
the
federal
government's
only
personnel?
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i'm
talking
about
the
express
exemption,
how
does
that
lead?
justice
abe
fortas
i
see,
and
it
does
--
does
not
limit
--
expressly
limited
to
employees
in
there?
justice
abe
fortas
you
said
--
you
said
compact,
you
mean
contract?
justice
abe
fortas
compact.
there
is
a
compact
in
this
--
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
martz,
suppose
the
secretary
would
decide
that
would
better
be
a
good
idea
to
have
this
sort
of
interpretive
tram
service,
serving
all
of
the
capital
park
areas,
all
of
the
park
areas
under
his
jurisdiction
in
the
district
of
columbia.
would
the
principle
there
be
any
different
with
respect
to
problem
that
we
have
before
us?
justice
abe
fortas
he
would
then
have
to
use
the
streets
in
the
district?
justice
abe
fortas
well
he
--
he
would
have
the
authority
there
just
as
much
as
he
has
at
in
the
present
case,
wouldn't
he?
justice
abe
fortas
particularly,
if
you
assume
that
in
the
present
case,
these
trams
will
have
to
use
some
city
street.
justice
abe
fortas
by
congress
to
do
it?
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
you
think
this
would
be
a
different
and
substantially
more
difficult
case
if
the
operation
of
these
trams
required
the
use
of
city
street
in
the
district
outside
of
the
park
area?
justice
abe
fortas
why,
why?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
similarly
then
he
could
provide
the
service
to
all
of
the
capital
parks
because
that's
transportation
by
the
federal
government?
that
is
--
that
is
correct
your

this
is
all

justice

so
that
in
your

commission?
justice

fortas
and
by

you
mean
its

exception?
justice
abe
fortas
you
don't
really
--
you
don't
really
mean
to
include
the
word

in
that
sense,
do
you?
justice

the

of
the
route
now
being
used
by
the
national
park
service?
justice
abe
fortas
is
it
operating
on
constitution
avenue?
justice
abe
fortas
as
shown
on
this
map?
justice
abe
fortas
do
all
of
the
sightseeing
agencies
in
the
district
of
columbia
obtain
franchise
or
something
in
the
sort
from
the
commission?
justice
abe
fortas
you
mean
to
say
all
of
them
that
we
see
on
the
street,
not
the
individual.
how
about
the
individuals
who
run?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
is
there
really
any
difference
of
opinion
on
the
question
that
you're
now
covering
that
is
to
say
that
if
universal
has
to
be
considered
and
it's
purely
private
capacity
and
not
as
an
agent
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior,
it
would
have
to
get
the
necessary
authority
from
the
commission,
is
there
any
conflict
as
to
that?
justice
abe
fortas
there
is
a
conflict
as
to
that?
justice
abe
fortas
why?
justice
abe
fortas
no,
i
didn't
make
my
question
clear
i
guess.
if
you
assume
that
universal
is
operating
in
a
purely
private
capacity
and
not
as
the
alter
ego
of
the
secretary,
there
is
no
dispute
is
there
that
universal
would
have
to
go
to
the
commission
and
get
authority
to
perform
the
service
that
is
here
involved,
is
that
in
dispute
or
is
it
not?
justice
abe
fortas
well
that's
the
question,
they
said
that
they
are
operating
as
the
alter
ego
of
the
secretary,
don't
they?
justice
abe
fortas
now
do
they
--
if
they
were
not
operating
as
the
alter
ego
of
the
secretary,
would
they
still
contend
that
they
do
not
have
to
get
the
permission
of
the
commission?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
then
you
would
feel
that
if
the
secretary
operated
this,
the
secretary
undertook
to
operate
this
service
himself
directly,
he
could
not
do
it
without
violating
the
terms
of
--
he
could
not
do
it.
justice
abe
fortas
your
position
differs
from
the
position
of
your
colleague?
justice
abe
fortas
it's
important
for
us
to
know
that
that
shows
the
thrust
of
your
argument.
justice
abe
fortas
that's
your
real
point
as
i
understand
it
is
that
the
charter
did
not
include
the
--
this
service
and
the
park
enclave
which
is
at
issue
here,
is
that
it?
