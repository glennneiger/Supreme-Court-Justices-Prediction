justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
don't
have
to
maintain
this
position
for
the
purposes
of
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
i
take
it
--
justice
byron
r.
white
if
the
city
streets
are
used
at
all.
if
the
so-called
city
streets
are
used
at
all
by
this
service,
it's
actually
on
city
streets
that
are
within
the
park
area
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean
that
the
only
streets
that
are
used
are
city
streets
that
are
actually
part
of
the
park?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
those
city
streets
are
used
in
the
mall
area
with
consent
of
the
secretary.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
which
is
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
by
the
streets,
are
the
actual
streets
that
traverse
the
mall,
are
they
part
of
the
parking
lot?
justice
byron
r.
white
specifically
then
where
has
the
secretary
get
the
authority
to
use
the
city
streets
in
furnishing
this
tram
way
service,
where
does
he
get
that
authority?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
i
gather
then
that
even
if
this
tram
way
service
did
run
per
block,
run
on
a
public
street
which
actually
traversed
the
mall,
that
it
would
be
within
that
authority?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that
wouldn't
reach
--
justice
byron
r.
white
that
wouldn't
reach
furnishing
service
between
parks?
justice
byron
r.
white
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
those
from
other
companies
do
actually
furnish
some
in
other
station?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it
isn't
exclusive?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
with
your
interpretation
of
the
--
of
the
commission's
authority
being
that
--
you
mean
that
you
could
provide
for
this
service
and
the
secretary
could
not
keep
it
up.
let's
assume
universal
--
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
that
universal
applied
to
you
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
granted
the
permit,
you
would
have
to
ask
the
secretary
or
anything
else.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
wanted
to
authorize
service
on
the
mall,
you
could
just
authorize
service
on
the
mall
and
as
far
as
the
transportation
part
of
this
is
concerned,
the
secretary
would
have
nothing
to
say
about
it,
that's
your
position?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
do
you
--
how
do
you
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
even
if
--
even
if
the
--
even
if
there
was
no
exemption,
i
mean
even
if
whether
there
is
an
exemption
or
not,
your
authority
is
subject,
the
authority
of
the
commission
is
subject
to
the
authority
of
the
secretary.
if
he
wanted
to
keep
your
permittee
off
the
park
lands,
he
could
do
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
work
the
other
way
around?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
about
the
port
to
run
these
vessels
unconstitutional
after?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
the
issue
that
mr.
justice
fortas
raised
with
the
counsel
a
while
ago
is
really
here,
whether
or
not
--
whether
or
not
the
secretary
has
the
authority
without
consulting
the
commission
to
operate
the
service
over
--
over
district
of
columbia
streets?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
didn't
understand
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
think
he's
going
but
that
--
what's
the
issue
that's
here?
the
issue
here
is
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
maybe
--
that
maybe
true
in
so
far
as
the
construction
of
the
exemption
is
concerned.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
could
be--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
yes
i
know
but
that
wouldn't
be
true
in
so
far
as
his
basic
authority
is
concerned.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
you
are
correct,
it
seems
to
me
that
--
and
this
is
not
transportation
by
united
states
then
the
exemption
--
the
exception
of
in
the
compact
doesn't
apply.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
your
authority
does
exist.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it
seems
to
me
that
that
the
extent
of
the
secretary's
power
in
that
situation
be
just
what
you
wanted
it
to
be
and
no
more.
you
would
have
if
you
wanted
to
have
exclusive
power.
there
wouldn't
be
any
real
legal
authority
of
the
secretary,
isn't
that
right?
if
it
--
you
would
be
operating
at
your
(inaudible),
i'm
not
saying
that's
wrong
but
this
is
a
legal
matter
if
the
compact
applies
that
you
have
the
authority.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
not
dual
authority,
one
authority?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
let
--
if
you
want,
if
you
permit
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
by
the
secretary
himself.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
your
position
in
that
part?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
--
nevertheless,
that's
only
true
if
the
service
is
over
and
approved.
justice
byron
r.
white
now
and
that
it
is
competitive
with
yours.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
do
you
think
you
have
any
authority,
do
you
think
the
commission
--
would
you
have
authority
now
to
operate
any
kind
of
a
sightseeing
tour
you
want
in
the
mall
area?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
recognize
that
the
secretary
has
any
authority
at
all
to
regulate
or
to
forbid
your
operations
in
the
mall?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
about
speed
limits
and
things
like
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
not
about
--
not
regulations?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
think
there
are
two
questions
in
the
part
whether
they
apply
even
the
franchise
who
has
direct
operations
by
the
secretary,
firstly.
and
secondly
whether
if
they
do
not
in
other
words,
do
they
require
of
this
franchise
apply
to
an
operation
by
the
secretary
to
apply
this,
you
don't
think
they
are
separate
questions
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
with
whom,
the
secretary?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
addition
to
--
justice
byron
r.
white
counsel,
this
is
all
of
constitution
under
the
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
who
police
that,
metropolitan
police
or
the
park
police?
justice
byron
r.
white
both
do?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
don't
have
to
maintain
this
position
for
the
purposes
of
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
i
take
it
--
justice
byron
r.
white
if
the
city
streets
are
used
at
all.
if
the
so-called

are
used
at
all
by
this
service,
it's
actually
on
city
streets
that
are
within
the
park
area
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean
that
the
only
streets
that
are
used
are
city
streets
that
are
actually
part
of
the
park?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
those
city
streets
are
used
in
the
mall
area
with
consent
of
the
secretary.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
which
is
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
by
the
streets,
are
the
actual
streets
that
traverse
the
mall,
are
they
part
of
the
parking

justice
byron

white
specifically
then
where
has
the

get
the
authority
to
use
the
city
streets
in
furnishing
this
tram
way
service,
where
does
he
get
that
authority?
justice

so
i

then
that
even

this

that
wouldn't

how

so
even
