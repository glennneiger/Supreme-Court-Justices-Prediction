stewart
you
don't
have
first
amendment
issue
in
this
case,
do
you?
justice
potter
stewart
what's
the
test,
the
public
convenience
and
necessity
or
somewhat?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
certainly
--
justice
potter
stewart
there
are
two
diverse
points
of
--
justice
potter
stewart
view
one
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
agency
would
see
it
in
terms
of
the
other
competing
and
complementary
transportation
services
in
the
metropolitan
area
i
suppose
and
the
secretary
would
see
it
in
terms
of
a
national
park.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that's
your
point
i
suppose?
justice
potter
stewart
no
opinions
were
subsequently
filed
by
any
member
of
the
court?
justice
potter
stewart
i
notice
there
was
reservation
of
the
privilege
to
do
so
but
--
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
martz,
as
a
matter
of
information
for
my
ignorance.
the
parks
in
the
district
of
columbia
are
some
district
of
columbia
and
some
national
parks,
for
example,
rock
creek
park
or
montrose
park
or
lafayette
park
or
someone
can
--
justice
potter
stewart
some
the
other?
justice
potter
stewart
is
a
national
park.
justice
potter
stewart
montrose
park
i
supposed
is
a
district
of
columbia
park,
don't
they?
justice
potter
stewart
national?
justice
potter
stewart
of
the
district?
justice
potter
stewart
and
all
parks
as
so
defined
are
national
park?
justice
potter
stewart
no
matter
what
their
size?
well,
i
was
not
pursuing,
i
was
just
--
justice

stewart
it's
on
page
36
(a)
of
the
brief
for
the
petitioner
set
out,
it's
the
act
of
july
24,
1956,is
that
right?
justice

page

(a)
of
the
main
brief
of
the
petitioner.
justice
potter
stewart
the
argument
you
are
now
making,
the
argument
you
are
now
making,
your
franchise
argument,
tell
me
if
i'm
wrong,
is
that
the
secretary
himself
cannot
do
this,
he
cannot
make
this
contract
because
of
your
exclusive
franchise?
justice
potter
stewart
their
franchise
antedates
the
compact
by
four
years?
justice
potter
stewart
you
got
the
franchise
directly
from
congress
in
1956.
justice
potter
stewart
the
compact
that
came
along
in
1960.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
martz,
you
directly
clarified
you
have
two
quite
distinct
arguments
of
both
of
which
of
course
are
answered,
responded
to
at
least
by
your
opponents,
but
then
in
addition,
they
have
a
third
argument
depending
not
at
all
upon
the
compact
that
upon
the
1956
franchise
that
congress
directly
gave
to
the
--
to
this
company,
now
how
do
you
--
neither
of
your
points
really
goes
to
meeting
that
argument,
do
they?
justice
potter
stewart
and
how
do
you
suppose
that
the
federal
government
itself
or
the
district
of
columbia
as
a
municipal
government
despite
this
franchise
given
to
this
company
by
congress
in
1956
could
all
of
a
sudden
say,
now,
well,
we're
now
kind
of
have
governmentally
operated,
owned
and
operated
public
transportation
in
the
district
of
columbia
and
we
are
not
going
to
pay
a
nickel
to
this
franchisee,
we're
just
going
to
--
no
condemnation,
no
purchase
involved.
we
are
just
going
to
go
in
business
because
where
the
government
and
this
franchise
doesn't
affect
us.
justice
potter
stewart
i'm
not
talking
about
the
compact.
i'm
talking
about
the
franchise.
justice
potter
stewart
well
that's
putting
aside
the
termination
provision.
do
you
suppose
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
not
to
compete
with
it
on
a
governmental
basis,
aren't
they?
justice
potter
stewart
to
the
secretary
of
the
interior
said,
i
--
all
of
the
interior
department
say
“we're
going
to
establish
and
operate
a
public
transportation
system
in
the
city
of
washington
despite
this
franchise?”
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
thought
your
further
argument
was
that
this
just
didn't
run
against
the
government
at
all,
just
have
run
against
the
sovereign.
justice
potter
stewart
the
contract
with
the
sovereign,
isn't
it?
isn't
it
franchise
the
nature
of
a
license
agreement
or
contract
with
the
congress
of
the
united
states.
justice

you
don't
