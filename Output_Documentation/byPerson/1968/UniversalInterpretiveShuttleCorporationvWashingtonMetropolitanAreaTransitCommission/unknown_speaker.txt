are
you

are
you
going
to
tell
us
what
use
your
client
would
have
to
make
of
the
streets
outside
of
the
park
service
areas?
unknown
speaker
so
there
--
there
would
be
no
pick-up
point
outside
the
park
area
that
is
so
defined.
unknown
speaker
because
the
washington
metropolitan
transit
commission
or
whatever
it's
called
does
have
jurisdiction,
does
it
not
on
the
district
of
columbia
streets?
unknown
speaker
at
least
outside
of
the
park
areas.
unknown
speaker
so
that
it's
your
understanding
that
this
court
may
consider
the
case
as
if
the
--
these
trams
operated
solely
on
park
service
area?
unknown

what
is
that
case?
unknown
speaker
there's
a
new
proposed
reception
center
in
the
old
union
station
to
be
under
the
park
service?
unknown
speaker
we'll
assume
that
it
is
for
the
moment,
i
rather
thought
it
was
from
what
i
had
read
in
the
paper
but
assume
that
this
for
the
moment,
what
if
we
held
with
you
in
this
case,
would
that
--
would
that
mean
that
the
secretary
of
the
interior
could
go
to
the
--
could
put
this
many
service
over
there
and
go
over
the
streets
of
the
city
from
the
parking
area
over
that
and
back?
